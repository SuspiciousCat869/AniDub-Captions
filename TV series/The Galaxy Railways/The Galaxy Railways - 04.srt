1
00:01:48,083 --> 00:01:52,208
[Narr] A long time ago a war
broke out on a faraway planet,

2
00:01:52,291 --> 00:01:56,625
and a black train appeared
and picked up the deceased.

3
00:01:56,708 --> 00:01:58,958
It is said that the
same train appeared

4
00:01:59,041 --> 00:02:01,583
after the big accident
on Orion Line

5
00:02:01,666 --> 00:02:05,458
and then, again, during the
plague on Planet Kayazen.

6
00:02:05,541 --> 00:02:08,416
The reports concerning
these last two incidents

7
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:10,375
are similar
to the first.

8
00:02:10,458 --> 00:02:15,875
A jet-black train appeared out
of nowhere to pick up the dead.

9
00:02:15,958 --> 00:02:19,500
Where did it take
them? Nobody knows.

10
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:33,041
Hey, Terry!
Your camera!

11
00:02:33,125 --> 00:02:34,375
Terry!
Wait up!

12
00:02:36,291 --> 00:02:38,666
What's wrong with you? Stop
acting like you don't hear me!

13
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:41,000
I'm your sister,
Terry, come on!

14
00:02:41,083 --> 00:02:42,541
No, please.
Don't do this.

15
00:02:42,625 --> 00:02:44,625
Karen's gone.
You have to let go.

16
00:02:48,375 --> 00:02:50,416
There's no such thing
as a ghost-train!

17
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:51,625
It's not
going to come!

18
00:02:51,708 --> 00:02:54,625
Yes it will. I have
to see Karen again.

19
00:02:54,708 --> 00:02:56,250
Even if it's
just a glimpse.

20
00:02:56,333 --> 00:02:58,041
Now go! Leave
me alone, Jane!

21
00:02:58,125 --> 00:02:59,833
No! You can't
make me!

22
00:02:59,916 --> 00:03:02,000
If you're staying I'm
staying and that's final!

23
00:03:02,791 --> 00:03:04,791
Whatever.
Suit yourself.

24
00:03:10,291 --> 00:03:12,916
I can't believe that you're
leaving your camera behind.

25
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,333
Photography
is your life.

26
00:03:14,416 --> 00:03:15,875
It's your dream
to become famous

27
00:03:15,958 --> 00:03:17,916
and make people happy
with your pictures.

28
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,291
How can you leave
your dream?

29
00:03:20,375 --> 00:03:22,625
You're not coming
back! Are you?

30
00:03:22,708 --> 00:03:24,541
I don't plan
to die, Jane.

31
00:03:24,625 --> 00:03:26,875
I think there's a good chance
that I can see Karen tonight,

32
00:03:26,958 --> 00:03:28,500
and that means more
than anything to me.

33
00:03:30,625 --> 00:03:31,458
Look at this.

34
00:03:31,541 --> 00:03:32,708
There's a planet
called Meridies

35
00:03:32,791 --> 00:03:34,750
that orbits two suns,
in a figure eight.

36
00:03:34,833 --> 00:03:38,083
Because of its orbit, nighttime
there lasts only 10 minutes.

37
00:03:38,166 --> 00:03:40,375
Well, one researcher
finally connected the dots

38
00:03:40,458 --> 00:03:42,541
and realized that that's
when the ghost-train appears,

39
00:03:42,625 --> 00:03:44,583
during those
10 minutes.

40
00:03:44,666 --> 00:03:46,375
Now, he's either
right or he's crazy,

41
00:03:46,458 --> 00:03:48,125
but I have to find
out which one.

42
00:03:49,458 --> 00:03:51,000
[Jane] Look!
What's happening?

43
00:03:51,083 --> 00:03:52,416
[Terry] I don't know!

44
00:03:54,083 --> 00:03:56,333
[Jane] This is wrong!
This station's closed!

45
00:03:56,416 --> 00:03:57,875
No trains ever
come here!

46
00:03:59,583 --> 00:04:00,500
That's it!

47
00:04:00,583 --> 00:04:01,583
I'm scared.

48
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:24,000
No! What are you doing?
Get away from there!

49
00:04:24,083 --> 00:04:25,583
It might not
bring you back!

50
00:04:31,458 --> 00:04:35,958
Terry, no! Get out of
there, Terry! Jump! Jump!

51
00:04:40,625 --> 00:04:41,500
Terry.

52
00:04:47,958 --> 00:04:49,250
Please come back.

53
00:04:57,416 --> 00:04:58,958
[Kate] Did you guys hear
that the Ghost Train

54
00:04:59,041 --> 00:05:00,833
appeared again
on Orion Line?

55
00:05:00,916 --> 00:05:02,833
[Sayaka] What do you mean?
What ghost-train?

56
00:05:02,916 --> 00:05:05,583
[Miki] You've never heard
of the Ghost Train?

57
00:05:05,666 --> 00:05:07,791
It takes souls to
the nether world.

58
00:05:07,875 --> 00:05:10,166
[Kate] Once you're on,
there's no going back.

59
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:12,041
The conductor looks
like a cadaver.

60
00:05:12,125 --> 00:05:14,375
He pulls up to the platform
and waves his hand:

61
00:05:14,458 --> 00:05:16,750
--All aboard! All aboard!
--All aboard! All aboard!

62
00:05:20,875 --> 00:05:22,458
What's got you
so worked up?

63
00:05:25,583 --> 00:05:27,833
What? You don't really
believe that nonsense, do you?

64
00:05:27,916 --> 00:05:30,583
No. Of course not. I'm just
telling you what I heard.

65
00:05:30,666 --> 00:05:32,375
Come on, Manabu.
Fess up.

66
00:05:32,458 --> 00:05:34,916
That story got under your skin.
You believe it, don't you?

67
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,250
Well, what
if I do?

68
00:05:36,333 --> 00:05:38,208
You don't know everything
about the nether world.

69
00:05:38,291 --> 00:05:39,625
It could
be possible.

70
00:05:39,708 --> 00:05:43,000
I don't believe it! Manabu
Yuuki believes in ghosts!

71
00:05:43,916 --> 00:05:46,833
Man, that's what I
get for being honest.

72
00:05:46,916 --> 00:05:48,666
[Announcer] Attention,
Sirius Platoon:

73
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:50,666
please report to the
Briefing Room immediately.

74
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:53,333
--Sirius Platoon: please...
[Louis] --Duty calls!

75
00:05:53,416 --> 00:05:54,541
[Manabu] Yeah.

76
00:05:55,666 --> 00:05:56,583
Gotta go!

77
00:05:56,666 --> 00:05:57,916
Wait! I'm
coming, too!

78
00:06:03,333 --> 00:06:04,291
You're late!

79
00:06:04,375 --> 00:06:05,291
Sorry, Sir!

80
00:06:07,291 --> 00:06:10,125
The train in question must
be a one-thirty-eight model

81
00:06:10,208 --> 00:06:12,500
because the witness said
that it has double headlights.

82
00:06:12,583 --> 00:06:13,625
But as most
of you know,

83
00:06:13,708 --> 00:06:15,791
the one-thirty-eight
was discontinued

84
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:16,958
during the
development phase

85
00:06:17,041 --> 00:06:19,375
of the Galaxy Railways
many years ago.

86
00:06:19,458 --> 00:06:23,291
The missing person is a 24 year
old male named Terry Goldman.

87
00:06:23,375 --> 00:06:25,291
He was last seen boarding
the train three months ago

88
00:06:25,375 --> 00:06:28,875
at a closed-down station
on the old Alpha Centauri Line.

89
00:06:28,958 --> 00:06:30,458
Our mission is
to find Terry

90
00:06:30,541 --> 00:06:33,333
and to figure out who's
operating this mysterious train.

91
00:06:33,416 --> 00:06:34,625
Are there
any questions?

92
00:06:34,708 --> 00:06:36,000
What's this
all about?

93
00:06:36,083 --> 00:06:38,416
Weren't you listening?
It's about the Ghost Train.

94
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:41,958
Has the train been sighted
anywhere else, Captain?

95
00:06:42,041 --> 00:06:44,166
The report mentions
two other appearances.

96
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:46,375
One was on
the Orion Line.

97
00:06:46,458 --> 00:06:48,833
The other was on the
Aldebaran Loop.

98
00:06:48,916 --> 00:06:51,583
Why has this case been left
alone for three months?

99
00:06:51,666 --> 00:06:52,875
The train
only appears

100
00:06:52,958 --> 00:06:55,791
when Planet Meridies
experiences nightfall.

101
00:06:55,875 --> 00:06:57,875
That only happens
once every three months.

102
00:07:00,333 --> 00:07:03,041
See that! My lucky coin
says it's a Ghost Train!

103
00:07:03,125 --> 00:07:04,041
So who's
our witness?

104
00:07:04,125 --> 00:07:06,375
Jane Goldman; a 19
year old female.

105
00:07:06,458 --> 00:07:08,583
She's the missing
person's younger sister.

106
00:07:08,666 --> 00:07:09,958
She's the
only witness?

107
00:07:10,041 --> 00:07:10,916
Correct.

108
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,791
Oh, great.
Just what we need.

109
00:07:12,875 --> 00:07:14,416
What do you mean
by that, Bruce?

110
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:17,041
She probably killed him
and made up that story.

111
00:07:17,125 --> 00:07:18,666
Manabu, you don't believe
that a Ghost Train

112
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:19,916
took him away,
do you?

113
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,125
Well, yeah.

114
00:07:21,208 --> 00:07:23,125
Now why does that not
surprise me, Yuuki?

115
00:07:25,958 --> 00:07:28,208
All right, Sirius Platoon!
Let's move out!

116
00:07:28,291 --> 00:07:29,416
--Yes, Sir!
--Yes, Sir!

117
00:07:31,625 --> 00:07:32,958
Manabu!

118
00:07:33,041 --> 00:07:35,416
Don't be late again.
Understood?

119
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:36,375
Yes, Captain.

120
00:07:36,458 --> 00:07:37,833
Well, what are
you waiting for?

121
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:41,166
[Crewmen]
System check!

122
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:43,000
Stand by for
System Check!

123
00:07:43,083 --> 00:07:45,833
Magnetic Barrier
Generator is a go!

124
00:07:45,916 --> 00:07:47,958
Big One is now in
take-off position!

125
00:07:49,583 --> 00:07:52,166
Cylinder valves open!
Boiler pressure ready!

126
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:53,708
The Main Circuit
is now online!

127
00:07:53,791 --> 00:07:55,666
All energy levels are
ready for take-off!

128
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:01,833
The warp drive coupling
is now in place!

129
00:08:01,916 --> 00:08:03,541
All systems green,
Captain Bulge!

130
00:08:03,625 --> 00:08:05,750
Awaiting your
command, Sir!

131
00:08:05,833 --> 00:08:07,625
Let's move out!
Ahead full!

132
00:08:29,916 --> 00:08:32,791
Was that the Ghost
Train that I saw?

133
00:08:42,833 --> 00:08:44,458
No! That's
impossible!

134
00:08:44,541 --> 00:08:46,583
Manabu?
Are you okay?

135
00:08:46,666 --> 00:08:50,083
Yeah, I'm fine. But next
time, put your own tray away!

136
00:08:50,166 --> 00:08:51,208
You made me late!

137
00:08:51,291 --> 00:08:53,333
What? Bologna! I did
put my tray away!

138
00:08:54,208 --> 00:08:56,041
Oh, maybe
I didn't.

139
00:08:56,125 --> 00:08:57,833
I'm sure it's in
there somewhere.

140
00:08:57,916 --> 00:08:59,333
What's that
supposed to mean?

141
00:08:59,416 --> 00:09:00,416
Nothing!

142
00:09:18,708 --> 00:09:21,250
Not even a ghost would want
to hang out in this dump.

143
00:09:22,375 --> 00:09:24,458
We're probably the first
train to use this station

144
00:09:24,541 --> 00:09:26,500
in well over
20 years.

145
00:09:26,583 --> 00:09:28,583
Except for the "you know what"
which should be joining us

146
00:09:28,666 --> 00:09:30,708
in 5 minutes
and 11 seconds.

147
00:09:30,791 --> 00:09:32,708
Now how'd you
figure that out?

148
00:09:32,791 --> 00:09:36,333
I charted Meridies' orbit on the
computer and extrapolated a bit.

149
00:09:36,416 --> 00:09:37,708
We can bet on
it if you like.

150
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:39,958
No thanks. You
cleaned me out

151
00:09:40,041 --> 00:09:42,208
on the last three
calculations we wagered on.

152
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,583
These must be Terry
and Jane's footprints.

153
00:09:46,666 --> 00:09:50,166
I wonder if we can figure out
where Terry's prints end.

154
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:52,833
Manabu, what's that,
over there?

155
00:09:52,916 --> 00:09:54,208
I guess one of
them drew this.

156
00:09:54,291 --> 00:09:56,333
That's the symbol
for infinity, isn't it?

157
00:09:56,416 --> 00:09:59,000
Yeah. But what do those two dots
in the middle stand for?

158
00:09:59,083 --> 00:10:00,750
[Jane] Those are the
Suns of Meridies.

159
00:10:03,125 --> 00:10:04,416
You're Jane
Goldman.

160
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:07,166
I recognize you from the
SDF report. My name's Louis.

161
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:08,416
Can you tell
us anything

162
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:09,958
about why your brother
got on the Ghost Train?

163
00:10:10,041 --> 00:10:11,083
Yes.

164
00:10:11,166 --> 00:10:12,541
[Manabu] Louis, look!
Check this out!

165
00:10:12,625 --> 00:10:14,166
[Jane] That's the same
thing that happened

166
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:15,750
the night the Ghost
Train was here!

167
00:10:28,791 --> 00:10:31,958
Oh, no! It's coming in too fast!
It's going to ram Big One!

168
00:10:43,833 --> 00:10:45,541
This isn't
Big One.

169
00:10:47,125 --> 00:10:48,666
Stop her, men!
She could die!

170
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:49,708
Jane!

171
00:10:49,791 --> 00:10:51,375
Don't do it!

172
00:10:51,458 --> 00:10:53,250
No! Terry's
in there!

173
00:10:53,333 --> 00:10:54,333
Manabu!

174
00:10:58,416 --> 00:10:59,875
Yuuki! Get off
that train!

175
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,458
Louis!
Manabu! No!

176
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,958
I.. I don't
believe it.

177
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,250
Louis. You're
squishing me.

178
00:11:35,333 --> 00:11:37,125
[Louis] How dare
you, Manabu!

179
00:11:37,208 --> 00:11:39,125
Are you saying that
I'm fat? [Smack!]

180
00:11:39,208 --> 00:11:40,625
Man! You're
vicious.

181
00:11:40,708 --> 00:11:42,375
Hmm! That
was nothing!

182
00:11:45,291 --> 00:11:47,041
Not so close!
I haven't forgiven you yet!

183
00:11:47,125 --> 00:11:48,291
You hit me!

184
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:50,083
[Conductor] Tickets!

185
00:11:50,166 --> 00:11:53,250
[Louis] It's all so real. How
can this be a Ghost Train?

186
00:11:53,333 --> 00:11:55,916
Excuse me, Ma'am. Do you know
where this train is heading?

187
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,250
Oh, well this train
doesn't have a destination.

188
00:11:58,333 --> 00:11:59,416
We're bound
for nowhere.

189
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:01,416
We're the ones who
choose when to get off.

190
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,833
Or we can stay on
forever if we'd like.

191
00:12:04,875 --> 00:12:06,208
Where are you
two getting off?

192
00:12:06,291 --> 00:12:08,083
We're just
enjoying the ride.

193
00:12:08,166 --> 00:12:11,250
No bills, no jobs, no
clocks, just each other.

194
00:12:11,333 --> 00:12:13,083
It's like a
long vacation.

195
00:12:13,166 --> 00:12:15,416
Excuse me, Sir.
Have you seen this man?

196
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,000
He boarded three
months ago.

197
00:12:17,083 --> 00:12:18,958
Good grief. That
hair; those clothes.

198
00:12:19,041 --> 00:12:20,791
He looks like a hippy
if I ever saw one.

199
00:12:20,875 --> 00:12:23,416
You won't find
him on this coach.

200
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:25,250
[Conductor] Good
evening, passengers.

201
00:12:25,333 --> 00:12:26,708
Our next stop is
Hazama Station.

202
00:12:26,791 --> 00:12:28,916
Louis, let's go up to the
Conductor's Cabin.

203
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,583
Our total stop time will be
18 minutes and 30 seconds.

204
00:12:31,666 --> 00:12:33,083
[Manabu] Uhh,
excuse me.

205
00:12:33,166 --> 00:12:34,708
I don't have time
for tourists.

206
00:12:34,791 --> 00:12:36,666
This train doesn't
fly itself you know.

207
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:40,208
SDF. My name's Manabu Yuuki,
and this is Louis Fort Drake.

208
00:12:40,291 --> 00:12:42,166
Can you tell me this
train's ID Number please?

209
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:44,333
This train doesn't
have an ID Number.

210
00:12:44,416 --> 00:12:45,458
Where's it going?

211
00:12:45,541 --> 00:12:47,833
Well, our next stop
is Hazama Station.

212
00:12:47,916 --> 00:12:49,416
I don't care what
our next stop is!

213
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,083
What's our final
destination?

214
00:12:51,166 --> 00:12:52,833
This train has no
destination.

215
00:12:52,916 --> 00:12:55,041
How can a train have
no destination?

216
00:12:55,125 --> 00:12:57,291
That question is beyond
my understanding.

217
00:12:57,375 --> 00:13:00,208
That question isn't even beyond
a 3 year old's understanding.

218
00:13:00,291 --> 00:13:02,041
You're just being
uncooperative.

219
00:13:02,125 --> 00:13:04,083
Come on, Manabu. We're
wasting our time here.

220
00:13:13,666 --> 00:13:14,791
Karen,
it's me!

221
00:13:20,625 --> 00:13:23,916
I know you're here!
Why won't you talk to me?

222
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,708
Would you care for some
coffee? It's nice and hot.

223
00:13:29,791 --> 00:13:31,541
Yeah.

224
00:13:31,625 --> 00:13:32,708
Huh?

225
00:13:32,791 --> 00:13:35,208
You shouldn't be here.
Why have you come?

226
00:13:35,291 --> 00:13:37,291
Because you're everything
to me, Karen. That's why.

227
00:13:37,375 --> 00:13:39,333
I don't belong to your
world anymore, Terry.

228
00:13:39,416 --> 00:13:40,958
You're going to
have to accept that.

229
00:13:41,041 --> 00:13:43,208
I love you, Karen.
That's all I know.

230
00:13:43,291 --> 00:13:45,291
I had to see you again
no matter what.

231
00:13:45,375 --> 00:13:48,083
Please. You don't belong here.
It's not your time yet.

232
00:13:48,166 --> 00:13:49,583
You're still
alive, Terry.

233
00:13:49,666 --> 00:13:51,750
I'm alive because I'm
here with you, Karen.

234
00:13:51,833 --> 00:13:53,416
That's all that matters to me.

235
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:56,541
I've missed you so much. You
don't know how hard it's been.

236
00:13:56,625 --> 00:13:58,250
We didn't even have
a chance to say goodbye.

237
00:13:58,333 --> 00:14:00,083
I keep seeing the
accident in my head,

238
00:14:00,166 --> 00:14:01,375
but I'm powerless
to change it.

239
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,750
[Karen] Where should I
stand? Over there?

240
00:14:04,833 --> 00:14:05,833
[Terry] Sure!

241
00:14:07,583 --> 00:14:08,291
Karen!

242
00:14:10,541 --> 00:14:11,416
Sneak!

243
00:14:12,416 --> 00:14:13,625
That's good
for now!

244
00:14:13,708 --> 00:14:14,416
One more.

245
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:15,625
All right.
Back up.

246
00:14:15,708 --> 00:14:16,541
How far?

247
00:14:16,625 --> 00:14:17,625
I don't know.

248
00:14:17,708 --> 00:14:19,458
Just tell me
when to stop.

249
00:14:20,166 --> 00:14:21,000
Perfect!

250
00:14:25,458 --> 00:14:26,666
Karen!!!

251
00:14:31,166 --> 00:14:32,333
Tough day.

252
00:14:32,416 --> 00:14:34,125
There was something I
was going to ask you.

253
00:14:34,208 --> 00:14:35,500
But then the
accident happened.

254
00:14:37,333 --> 00:14:39,291
Will you marry
me, Karen?

255
00:14:41,625 --> 00:14:46,041
Here. I'll put it on.
What's the matter?

256
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,625
I can't lose you
again, Karen.

257
00:14:49,708 --> 00:14:53,958
Please. Don't ever leave me.
Stay with me forever.

258
00:14:57,208 --> 00:15:00,166
I knew staying on this train
was my only chance to see you.

259
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:04,250
But when you got on I
was scared to face you.

260
00:15:04,333 --> 00:15:06,791
I've been hiding from
you, Terry. Forgive me.

261
00:15:06,875 --> 00:15:09,375
It's okay.
Everything's fine now.

262
00:15:13,833 --> 00:15:15,916
[Manabu] Excuse me. Are
you Terry Goldman?

263
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
[Louis] We're with the
Space Defense Force.

264
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:19,833
Your sister filed a
missing persons report.

265
00:15:19,916 --> 00:15:21,041
We were sent
to find you.

266
00:15:21,125 --> 00:15:24,208
Well, you found me.
Tell Jane not to worry.

267
00:15:24,291 --> 00:15:26,416
Hey, you two are
alive, aren't you?

268
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:29,166
You don't belong here! This
train is only for the dead!

269
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:31,875
Then what are you doing here,
Terry? You're still alive!

270
00:15:31,958 --> 00:15:33,250
But you won't
be for long!

271
00:15:33,333 --> 00:15:35,208
If you decide to stay
with her you'll die!

272
00:15:39,541 --> 00:15:41,083
[Manabu] Huh?
They're gone!

273
00:15:41,166 --> 00:15:44,333
Come in Big One. This is Louis.
Repeat: Come in, Big One.

274
00:15:44,416 --> 00:15:47,750
We've found Terry Goldman,
Captain. Mine's not working.

275
00:15:47,833 --> 00:15:50,708
Big One. Come in.
Wait a second!

276
00:15:50,791 --> 00:15:51,750
What is it?

277
00:15:51,833 --> 00:15:53,833
Time! It stopped!

278
00:15:57,333 --> 00:15:58,583
[Bruce] He just
joined the platoon

279
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:00,708
and we're already chasing
him through the cosmos.

280
00:16:00,791 --> 00:16:02,125
Captain!

281
00:16:02,208 --> 00:16:03,208
Should we check with the
Network Radar at headquarters?

282
00:16:03,291 --> 00:16:04,458
Forget about
the radar!

283
00:16:04,541 --> 00:16:06,750
Patch me through to
the Supreme Commander!

284
00:16:06,833 --> 00:16:07,583
Yes, Sir!

285
00:16:10,166 --> 00:16:13,166
Yes, Captain Bulge. This is
about Manabu, isn't it?

286
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:15,750
Yes. Actually, Louis
is with him as well.

287
00:16:15,833 --> 00:16:18,541
We're trying to contact them,
but we can't get a reply.

288
00:16:18,625 --> 00:16:21,208
That's no ordinary train
that they're on, Captain.

289
00:16:21,291 --> 00:16:23,041
Its name is Eternity;

290
00:16:23,125 --> 00:16:25,833
it connects the physical
plane with the next realm.

291
00:16:25,916 --> 00:16:29,083
You won't find its course
on any timetable or diagram.

292
00:16:29,166 --> 00:16:31,000
I'm afraid there's
no way to stop it.

293
00:16:31,083 --> 00:16:32,916
But, we have to
get them back.

294
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,083
They chose to board that
train of their own free will.

295
00:16:36,166 --> 00:16:37,875
Let Fate take
its course.

296
00:16:37,958 --> 00:16:39,250
I can't!
I have to try!

297
00:16:39,333 --> 00:16:41,666
Do as your heart
tells you to, Captain.

298
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:43,916
Your actions can
make a difference.

299
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,666
Captain! We're getting a
signal on the Orbit Radar!

300
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:48,625
Chart it on the main
holograph, David.

301
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,083
[Bulge] There it is.
We found it.

302
00:16:52,166 --> 00:16:53,583
[David] It's gone
again, Captain!

303
00:16:53,666 --> 00:16:54,666
Damn!

304
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:56,666
Hey, Jane. Try not
to worry too much.

305
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:58,291
Captain Bulge will
find your brother.

306
00:16:58,375 --> 00:16:59,375
I know
he will.

307
00:17:04,291 --> 00:17:06,583
Based on their last position
they should be just ahead.

308
00:17:06,666 --> 00:17:08,083
Steady as she
goes, David.

309
00:17:08,166 --> 00:17:10,500
Will do, Captain.
Hey, uh... Yo, Bruce.

310
00:17:10,583 --> 00:17:12,625
I'll bet you a thousand ables
that we make it back home.

311
00:17:12,708 --> 00:17:15,541
That's a sucker bet. If we make
it home you get a thousand.

312
00:17:15,625 --> 00:17:17,125
If we don't
we're both dead.

313
00:17:17,208 --> 00:17:18,375
It was worth
a shot.

314
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,458
I don't
believe it!

315
00:17:24,541 --> 00:17:26,000
We found
it, Captain!

316
00:17:26,083 --> 00:17:28,416
This may be our only chance!
Maximum power! Don't lose it!

317
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:29,291
Yes, Sir!

318
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,250
[Bruce] What's happening?

319
00:17:37,333 --> 00:17:38,791
[David] We're hitting some
sort of energy field!

320
00:17:38,875 --> 00:17:40,500
It's draining our power!

321
00:17:47,333 --> 00:17:49,083
[Terry] This is it!
Are you ready?

322
00:17:49,166 --> 00:17:50,500
Yes.

323
00:17:50,583 --> 00:17:53,500
Huh? Uh, excuse me there, folks.
What is this place?

324
00:17:53,583 --> 00:17:57,208
It's Hazama Station. This is
where we get off, young man.

325
00:17:57,291 --> 00:17:58,458
You, too?

326
00:17:58,541 --> 00:18:00,541
Yes, Sir. My mother's
here to pick me up. See?

327
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,708
Manabu, what
are you doing?

328
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:04,791
I'm just
looking!

329
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:06,041
There's no
time for that!

330
00:18:06,125 --> 00:18:07,666
We need to find Terry
or we'll lose him!

331
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:08,291
Right!

332
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:10,666
[Karen] Once you pass
through this gate

333
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:12,833
you can never return
to your world.

334
00:18:12,916 --> 00:18:16,250
I know. I don't care.
You are my world, Karen.

335
00:18:16,333 --> 00:18:17,500
Oh, Terry.

336
00:18:17,583 --> 00:18:18,416
Terry!

337
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:19,833
Stop!

338
00:18:19,916 --> 00:18:21,083
Just mind your
own business!

339
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:22,666
[Manabu] Look, I
know how you feel!

340
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:24,416
I lost my father
and my brother!

341
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:26,375
But this isn't right!
It's not your time yet!

342
00:18:27,166 --> 00:18:29,416
You have to live on!
You can't just give up and die!

343
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:31,500
[Louis] Please! Think about
your sister, Terry!

344
00:18:31,583 --> 00:18:33,333
She loves you!
She still needs you!

345
00:18:33,416 --> 00:18:36,416
Talk to her for me. Tell her
I died with my dream in my arms.

346
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:37,916
[Louis] No!
Don't be a fool!

347
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,875
Stop! You don't know
anything about us!

348
00:18:41,333 --> 00:18:42,541
Terry and I
love each other!

349
00:18:42,625 --> 00:18:43,875
Let go! You're
hurting me!

350
00:18:43,958 --> 00:18:45,916
Yes, you're feeling
weak, aren't you?

351
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,458
We're on the threshold
of my world now!

352
00:18:47,541 --> 00:18:49,083
If I don't let
go you'll die!

353
00:18:49,166 --> 00:18:50,208
No!
Stop it!

354
00:18:53,791 --> 00:18:56,166
Leave us! If you don't
I'll have to kill you!

355
00:19:06,625 --> 00:19:09,708
Manabu! Louis! Are
you two all right?

356
00:19:09,791 --> 00:19:12,125
Terry! It's you!
You're alive!

357
00:19:12,208 --> 00:19:14,500
I was so worried! I never
thought I'd see you again!

358
00:19:14,583 --> 00:19:17,041
Thank goodness you're all right!
I thought you were dead!

359
00:19:17,125 --> 00:19:19,000
Why did you get
on that train?

360
00:19:19,083 --> 00:19:21,083
Did you ever think how
that would make Mom feel?

361
00:19:21,166 --> 00:19:24,166
Do you know how hurt we were
when we thought we lost you?

362
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,916
I'm sorry, Jane. I
have to be going now.

363
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,291
What do
you mean?

364
00:19:29,375 --> 00:19:31,708
I'm going to be with Karen.
It's what we both want.

365
00:19:31,791 --> 00:19:33,166
No! You can't!

366
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:35,583
Karen, I'm so sorry
about the accident.

367
00:19:35,666 --> 00:19:36,916
We've missed
you so much.

368
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,583
Please, don't
take him, Karen.

369
00:19:39,666 --> 00:19:41,708
What about his dream
of being a photographer?

370
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,583
Isn't that a dream
worth living for?

371
00:19:46,666 --> 00:19:49,416
Karen, wait!
What's wrong?

372
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,916
Thank you for coming
this far to see me, Terry.

373
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,583
You don't know how
much that means to me.

374
00:19:53,666 --> 00:19:55,083
Karen.

375
00:19:55,166 --> 00:19:57,583
And thank you for the ring,
Terry. It's so beautiful.

376
00:19:57,666 --> 00:19:59,333
It's all I need to
remember you by.

377
00:19:59,416 --> 00:20:00,500
But aren't we...

378
00:20:00,583 --> 00:20:03,416
Going to be together?
Of course. Always.

379
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:06,708
Nothing can keep us apart, not
even the distance between us.

380
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:11,250
Karen?
No! Wait!

381
00:20:14,041 --> 00:20:16,750
It's not our time yet,
Terry! I want you to live!

382
00:20:16,833 --> 00:20:18,083
Realize your
dream for me!

383
00:20:18,166 --> 00:20:19,625
No! I want to
come with you!

384
00:20:19,708 --> 00:20:21,125
Be strong,
Terry!

385
00:20:21,208 --> 00:20:23,916
We'll have our wedding when
we meet again! I love you!

386
00:20:25,041 --> 00:20:26,458
Karen!

387
00:20:28,166 --> 00:20:29,458
[Narr] In this life,

388
00:20:29,541 --> 00:20:31,750
people are brought together
and pulled apart again

389
00:20:31,833 --> 00:20:35,500
as sure as the tide rises
and goes back out to sea.

390
00:20:35,583 --> 00:20:37,541
What can man learn
from this endless

391
00:20:37,625 --> 00:20:40,291
coming together and
being torn asunder?

392
00:20:40,375 --> 00:20:42,375
What else, but to
overcome his grief

393
00:20:42,458 --> 00:20:46,916
and to expand his love beyond
the bounds of space and time.

394
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,500
I don't know how
to repay you all.

395
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:53,791
Terry's been a new
man since his return.

396
00:20:53,875 --> 00:20:56,041
He's been traveling
all over the continent.

397
00:20:56,125 --> 00:20:59,291
Every time I hear from him
he seems more like his old self.

398
00:20:59,375 --> 00:21:00,750
He's taken up
photography again

399
00:21:00,833 --> 00:21:03,500
and he's been sending me
some stunning pictures.

400
00:21:04,416 --> 00:21:07,291
Manabu, Louis, you gave
me back my brother,

401
00:21:07,375 --> 00:21:09,500
and I thank you, and the
rest of Sirius Platoon,

402
00:21:09,583 --> 00:21:11,375
from the bottom
of my heart.

403
00:21:11,458 --> 00:21:14,250
I hope this message
finds you well. See ya.

404
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:18,875
Do you believe in fate, Louis?
That we can't control it.

405
00:21:18,958 --> 00:21:20,916
I don't know.
I'm not really sure.

406
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,916
But I did see a guy jump
on a train one time

407
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,916
and change a man's
fate forever.

408
00:21:38,375 --> 00:21:40,541
[Beep, beep, beep...]

409
00:23:23,916 --> 00:23:25,375
On the next
Galaxy Railways,

410
00:23:25,458 --> 00:23:28,166
we're sent to investigate an
accident on Planet Leo Glando.

411
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:29,375
But when
things go wrong

412
00:23:29,458 --> 00:23:31,166
our Platoon is ordered
to destroy Big One,

413
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:32,583
and by chance I
have to confront

414
00:23:32,666 --> 00:23:34,166
the man who killed
my brother.

415
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:37,166
Or is there such thing as
chance? I'm starting to wonder.

416
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:39,083
See you next time
on the Railways.
