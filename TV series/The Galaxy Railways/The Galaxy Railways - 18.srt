1
00:01:51,708 --> 00:01:53,291
[Commander] All SDF
platoons and battalions

2
00:01:53,375 --> 00:01:55,416
initiate First Class
Emergency Alert!

3
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:58,125
Repeat: initiate First
Class Emergency Alert.

4
00:01:58,208 --> 00:01:59,375
[Kate] Yes, Sir!

5
00:01:59,458 --> 00:02:01,166
Declaring state of First
Class Emergency Alert!

6
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:03,625
All active-duty SDF
troops have been notified!

7
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:07,458
[Member A] Division
#25 reporting in...

8
00:02:07,541 --> 00:02:09,958
The SDF Main Gate
is now shut down!

9
00:02:10,041 --> 00:02:11,833
[Sayaka]
Ten-Four...

10
00:02:11,916 --> 00:02:13,750
[Member B] Gate #34
closed and secure!

11
00:02:13,833 --> 00:02:14,791
[Brad]
Ten-Four...

12
00:02:14,875 --> 00:02:16,958
What in tarnation's
going on now?

13
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,416
[Franz] Commander! The Main
Entrance has been closed!

14
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:22,958
[Commander] Good.

15
00:02:23,041 --> 00:02:24,791
[Miki] Sensors indicate the
intruder is heading toward

16
00:02:24,875 --> 00:02:26,166
Block N
right now!

17
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:27,500
Yuuki,
let's go!

18
00:02:29,666 --> 00:02:32,291
[Narrator] While working
to protect law and order,

19
00:02:32,375 --> 00:02:35,291
many dangerous
situations arise.

20
00:02:35,375 --> 00:02:37,500
Often times, one
individual will die

21
00:02:37,583 --> 00:02:40,333
while the one standing
next to him will be spared.

22
00:02:40,416 --> 00:02:43,833
But these survivors are
usually not branded as lucky.

23
00:02:43,916 --> 00:02:45,125
On the
contrary,

24
00:02:45,208 --> 00:02:47,833
they are usually avoided
by their peers in battle

25
00:02:47,916 --> 00:02:51,291
because they are seen
as emissaries of Death.

26
00:03:07,666 --> 00:03:09,541
[Sayaka] Commander, the
intruder is now passing

27
00:03:09,625 --> 00:03:10,458
through
Block 2!

28
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:15,500
I want that block locked
down now immediately!

29
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:45,791
Owen!

30
00:03:48,833 --> 00:03:59,041
No... It can't... It
can't be! It's impossible!

31
00:03:59,125 --> 00:04:01,583
Manabu...

32
00:04:01,666 --> 00:04:04,333
MANABU!!!!

33
00:04:07,958 --> 00:04:09,250
[Yuki] His vital
signs are stable...

34
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:11,583
average pulse
rate 68...

35
00:04:11,666 --> 00:04:14,041
I'm going to need 2 more
units of blood here!

36
00:04:21,125 --> 00:04:22,500
Manabu?

37
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,000
Is it happening again?

38
00:04:34,333 --> 00:04:35,583
[Yuki] I need
more Zinine!

39
00:04:35,666 --> 00:04:39,291
[Male Member] Hurry
up with that blood!

40
00:04:39,375 --> 00:04:42,250
Damn. Right in our
own headquarters.

41
00:04:43,375 --> 00:04:44,250
Manabu...

42
00:04:44,333 --> 00:04:45,083
Yuuki!!

43
00:04:45,166 --> 00:04:47,291
Manabu?!

44
00:04:47,375 --> 00:04:49,791
Did we... did
we get him?

45
00:04:49,875 --> 00:04:51,833
Please don't try
to talk now.

46
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:53,750
Yuki... How's
he doing?

47
00:04:54,208 --> 00:04:57,916
His injuries are severe, but
he's doing much better now.

48
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:58,958
Very good.

49
00:04:59,041 --> 00:05:01,125
Captain, what
about the intruder?

50
00:05:01,208 --> 00:05:02,583
He's still
on the loose.

51
00:05:02,666 --> 00:05:04,208
But I don't want you
worrying about that.

52
00:05:04,291 --> 00:05:08,125
Just get better... Bruce,
David, Louis; you're done here.

53
00:05:08,208 --> 00:05:09,458
Rejoin
the search.

54
00:05:09,541 --> 00:05:10,458
[All]
Yes sir!

55
00:05:10,541 --> 00:05:11,958
Captain... I'm
coming too!

56
00:05:12,041 --> 00:05:13,958
You're not
well enough!

57
00:05:14,041 --> 00:05:16,125
You heard her! You
should stay put!

58
00:05:16,208 --> 00:05:17,208
Bruce?

59
00:05:17,291 --> 00:05:19,125
Yuki! Keep an
eye on him!

60
00:05:19,208 --> 00:05:20,458
Right.
I will.

61
00:05:20,541 --> 00:05:22,708
It's just a scratch;
I'll be fine!

62
00:05:22,791 --> 00:05:23,625
Lay down!

63
00:05:27,833 --> 00:05:28,708
Let's go.

64
00:05:28,791 --> 00:05:30,875
Yes, Sir.

65
00:05:39,916 --> 00:05:42,666
The intruder's been found.
Three crewmen are down.

66
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:44,666
Send backup
at once!

67
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:46,000
Yes sir!

68
00:06:01,708 --> 00:06:04,208
Cease fire!

69
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:15,791
Did we get'm?

70
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:16,916
Can't
tell...

71
00:06:20,833 --> 00:06:23,750
Communication from the backup
troops has been cut off.

72
00:06:23,833 --> 00:06:25,583
I understand.

73
00:06:25,666 --> 00:06:27,416
The lives of many
dedicated people

74
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:29,708
are being
needlessly destroyed.

75
00:06:29,791 --> 00:06:33,208
The younger generation must
take-over where they left off.

76
00:06:33,291 --> 00:06:35,375
Don't let their
deaths be in vain.

77
00:06:37,291 --> 00:06:39,458
Why? Lately I
thought that Bruce

78
00:06:39,541 --> 00:06:42,041
had really started
to believe in me.

79
00:06:42,125 --> 00:06:45,541
Don't worry about it;
I'm sure that he does.

80
00:06:48,166 --> 00:06:50,750
It has to do with
Owen, not you.

81
00:06:50,833 --> 00:06:53,458
Damn... guess
I screwed up.

82
00:06:53,541 --> 00:06:56,666
Owen!

83
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:58,291
It's not
your fault...

84
00:06:58,375 --> 00:07:03,041
I let my guard down,
Bruce... I knew better.

85
00:07:03,125 --> 00:07:05,041
Try not to talk!
Yuki's on the way!

86
00:07:05,125 --> 00:07:06,958
I'm all right.

87
00:07:07,041 --> 00:07:10,958
I told you... I'm
immortal partner.

88
00:07:11,041 --> 00:07:11,916
Stop
talking!

89
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,916
You just wait...

90
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:19,416
I'll prove that you're not
Toxic Bruce... anymore. Okay?

91
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:24,458
Owen... Owen!?
Don't quit on me now!

92
00:07:24,541 --> 00:07:26,125
OWEN!!!

93
00:07:28,041 --> 00:07:30,625
I remember him saying
at the time it happened:

94
00:07:30,708 --> 00:07:34,958
It's like Death just
keeps hovering around me.

95
00:07:35,041 --> 00:07:37,458
Since Owen died, Bruce has
been trying to get assignments

96
00:07:37,541 --> 00:07:39,375
that don't
require a partner.

97
00:07:39,458 --> 00:07:41,000
He's afraid that
working along side him

98
00:07:41,083 --> 00:07:43,625
will result in someone
getting killed.

99
00:07:43,708 --> 00:07:47,041
And now that you've come along,
I can tell Bruce is worried.

100
00:07:47,125 --> 00:07:49,541
He's afraid that Death
is out to get you...

101
00:07:49,625 --> 00:07:51,416
That's why he's
acting this way.

102
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,875
I see.

103
00:07:53,958 --> 00:07:55,666
You should
stay put!

104
00:07:56,291 --> 00:07:58,625
Manabu...?
Sit down.

105
00:07:58,708 --> 00:08:01,291
Don't you understand
Yuki; I've got to go.

106
00:08:01,375 --> 00:08:02,666
If that's what
Bruce is afraid of,

107
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:04,875
then I need to set
the record straight.

108
00:08:06,541 --> 00:08:07,791
All this stuff
about Toxic Bruce

109
00:08:07,875 --> 00:08:09,583
is a bunch
of bull-

110
00:08:09,666 --> 00:08:11,916
it's nothing but
pure coincidence!

111
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,083
And I'm going to prove
it to him finally!

112
00:08:14,166 --> 00:08:15,083
I have to!

113
00:08:22,375 --> 00:08:24,708
This is Special Intelligence
Unit Eight-Three.

114
00:08:24,791 --> 00:08:27,250
I have obtained the
classified information.

115
00:08:27,333 --> 00:08:30,166
I should be at the rendezvous
point in ten minutes.

116
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:32,125
Someone's accessed the
Communication Terminal

117
00:08:32,208 --> 00:08:33,000
on Dock 5!

118
00:08:33,083 --> 00:08:33,625
Shut it down!

119
00:08:33,708 --> 00:08:35,833
Yes sir!

120
00:08:36,416 --> 00:08:37,666
Get some men
over there!

121
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:39,625
This might be the
best chance we get!

122
00:08:39,708 --> 00:08:40,958
Yes, Sir!

123
00:08:41,041 --> 00:08:42,666
All available
combat personnel!

124
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:44,666
Proceed to
Maintenance Dock 5!

125
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:47,583
Bruce here, I'm in
position on Dock 5.

126
00:08:47,666 --> 00:08:49,458
Ten-four.
Be careful.

127
00:08:49,541 --> 00:08:50,833
Roger that.

128
00:08:56,958 --> 00:08:59,208
I'm at the terminal
on Dock 5.

129
00:09:03,666 --> 00:09:07,541
No, negative. There's no sign
of the intruder. All clear.

130
00:09:07,625 --> 00:09:09,833
[Buldge] Affirmative;
don't let your guard down.

131
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:13,250
I'm sending David and Louis
to back you up. Be careful.

132
00:09:13,333 --> 00:09:13,833
Roger!

133
00:09:19,666 --> 00:09:21,083
Bruce.

134
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:23,916
Bruce!!

135
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:36,666
Gas grenades?

136
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:39,083
Don't
breathe!

137
00:09:39,166 --> 00:09:41,958
Sensors detecting
presence of gas on Dock 5!

138
00:09:42,041 --> 00:09:43,916
You're right! I
think its Nerve Gas!

139
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,250
Anyone below ground
is in danger!

140
00:09:46,333 --> 00:09:48,583
Close Block 3!! All
personnel underground

141
00:09:48,666 --> 00:09:50,916
must wear a gas
mask or a helmet!

142
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,958
Closing Partition
Walls in Block 3!

143
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:55,958
Opening vents!

144
00:10:04,208 --> 00:10:05,583
Who's
there?!

145
00:10:10,833 --> 00:10:15,291
Bruce! Here! I
brought this for you!

146
00:10:18,041 --> 00:10:20,833
Why did you come here?!
I told you not to!!

147
00:10:23,083 --> 00:10:25,333
[Buldge] David! David!?
Can you hear me?!

148
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:26,666
What's up?

149
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:28,083
Yuuki's
out here!

150
00:10:28,166 --> 00:10:28,791
Manabu?!

151
00:10:28,875 --> 00:10:30,041
Let's go!

152
00:10:30,125 --> 00:10:32,083
What do you think you're
doing out here, Yuuki?

153
00:10:32,166 --> 00:10:33,916
I came out here to
help you, Bruce.

154
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,333
That's what partners
do. Did you forget?

155
00:10:36,416 --> 00:10:37,750
You've got
to go back!

156
00:10:37,833 --> 00:10:39,791
I won't do it! I'm
going with you.

157
00:10:39,875 --> 00:10:41,916
I said stay
away from me!

158
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,416
Why Bruce?

159
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:47,125
I'm cursed... It's dangerous
to be with me. I'm bad luck.

160
00:10:47,208 --> 00:10:49,500
Aw, come on! You're just
being superstitious!

161
00:10:49,583 --> 00:10:50,833
You're wrong!

162
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:53,583
Whoever becomes my partner
always gets killed...

163
00:10:53,666 --> 00:10:55,333
It's my fate!
You understand?!

164
00:10:55,416 --> 00:10:58,375
I don't believe that. I'll
prove that you're wrong!

165
00:11:01,083 --> 00:11:04,458
Bruce!! Manabu,
what are you doing?

166
00:11:04,541 --> 00:11:06,500
Manabu? Sure
you're up to this?

167
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:08,500
Just take him back
to the Medical Bay.

168
00:11:08,583 --> 00:11:09,416
Stop it!

169
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:10,458
You can't tell
me what to do!

170
00:11:10,541 --> 00:11:11,791
Manabu!

171
00:11:11,875 --> 00:11:15,916
No! Let go of me! I'm not
going back! Bruce, wait!

172
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,166
I'm not willing to put an
injured person in harm's way!

173
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:19,833
And that's final!

174
00:11:19,916 --> 00:11:22,583
Bruce! No!
Just let me go!

175
00:11:22,666 --> 00:11:27,125
Manabu, listen to me. You've
heard about Toxic Bruce?

176
00:11:27,208 --> 00:11:29,291
His partners
all end up dead?

177
00:11:29,375 --> 00:11:30,708
It's not you.

178
00:11:30,791 --> 00:11:36,416
I know. But still, I want
to go with him. I have to!

179
00:11:39,291 --> 00:11:42,625
I won't try to stop you.
Just be careful. Huh?

180
00:11:42,708 --> 00:11:43,583
I will...

181
00:11:46,541 --> 00:11:48,458
Don't you dare
get killed.

182
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:49,958
Manabu.

183
00:11:50,041 --> 00:11:52,583
Louis! Come on!
We'll go this way!

184
00:11:52,666 --> 00:11:53,375
Right!

185
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:04,708
I wondered how
long it'd be,

186
00:12:04,791 --> 00:12:06,666
'til that gas started
to affect me.

187
00:12:26,333 --> 00:12:29,625
Tell me where the intruder
is! I need answers!

188
00:12:29,708 --> 00:12:31,916
We think that he's trying to
move from the Maintenance Deck

189
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,416
to Block B,
Commander!

190
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:36,291
Then why haven't we closed
Hatch Twenty-Eight in Block B?!

191
00:12:36,375 --> 00:12:38,125
Closing Hatch
Twenty-eight now!

192
00:12:43,333 --> 00:12:44,458
Status
update!

193
00:12:44,541 --> 00:12:46,041
Maintenance Division
Twenty-Five is reporting

194
00:12:46,125 --> 00:12:47,916
Five missing and
three injured!

195
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,916
Five percent of all SDF
members have been injured;

196
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,958
many in serious
condition.

197
00:12:52,041 --> 00:12:53,916
Intruder confirmed
in Block B!

198
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,583
This is Julia
reporting!

199
00:12:55,666 --> 00:12:57,833
Motion sensors indicate
that the intruder is moving

200
00:12:57,916 --> 00:12:59,958
from Area Nine
to Area Eight!

201
00:13:00,041 --> 00:13:02,958
Attention, Sirius
Platoon! David! Louis!

202
00:13:03,041 --> 00:13:05,500
Go with Bruce to
Area Eight at once!

203
00:13:05,583 --> 00:13:06,875
[All]
Yes sir.

204
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:10,500
Bruce? Bruce, do you copy?!
Bruce, please report!

205
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:15,416
Go on. We'll keep you
updated, Schwanheld.

206
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:16,375
Thanks.

207
00:13:19,375 --> 00:13:21,041
Freeze!

208
00:13:22,083 --> 00:13:25,125
Now! Stay where you are!
You move and you're dead!

209
00:13:25,208 --> 00:13:26,708
Tell me what
you're doing here!

210
00:13:26,791 --> 00:13:32,875
You heard me! Speak up! Tell
me what you're... doing here.

211
00:13:41,041 --> 00:13:45,833
It's you!
Leave me alone!!

212
00:13:49,041 --> 00:13:51,041
Ah.
Damn you.

213
00:14:12,291 --> 00:14:13,875
Toxic Bruce, right?

214
00:14:14,708 --> 00:14:18,291
You know...
who I am?

215
00:14:18,375 --> 00:14:20,833
Of course! I'm
Owen the Immortal!

216
00:14:20,916 --> 00:14:23,833
And I've come to transform
you from Toxic Bruce

217
00:14:23,916 --> 00:14:27,541
to Just-Plain Bruce. But it's
going be a very bumpy ride.

218
00:14:27,625 --> 00:14:28,875
Let me be!

219
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:37,208
Commander! The engine
assigned to Cargo Train

220
00:14:37,291 --> 00:14:39,166
Number Five-Thirty-One at
Maintenance Dock Four

221
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:40,291
has just been
turned on!

222
00:14:40,375 --> 00:14:41,291
Shut
it down!

223
00:14:41,375 --> 00:14:44,708
It's not
responding!

224
00:14:44,791 --> 00:14:45,875
Close the
Partition!

225
00:14:45,958 --> 00:14:46,750
Yes, sir!

226
00:15:02,333 --> 00:15:04,166
I'll finish you
once and for all!!

227
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:06,708
No!!!

228
00:15:06,791 --> 00:15:08,500
Bruce!!!

229
00:15:20,791 --> 00:15:23,000
That was a reckless move!
You could have been killed!

230
00:15:23,083 --> 00:15:25,750
If you have a death wish,
join another platoon!

231
00:15:25,833 --> 00:15:27,041
We don't want
you here!

232
00:15:27,791 --> 00:15:30,833
You remember saying that
to me once, don't you?

233
00:15:30,916 --> 00:15:31,208
This is Manab-

234
00:15:31,291 --> 00:15:32,416
Quiet!

235
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:33,958
Why did you
stop me!?

236
00:15:38,875 --> 00:15:41,291
Stay here, Yuuki!

237
00:15:41,375 --> 00:15:42,916
No! I'm going
with you!

238
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:43,916
No you're not!

239
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,750
Then you're not
going either!

240
00:15:45,833 --> 00:15:47,958
I have to do this
alone! Understand me?!

241
00:15:48,041 --> 00:15:50,625
I don't want you
to die! Now move!!

242
00:15:50,708 --> 00:15:53,041
Bruce.

243
00:15:53,916 --> 00:15:59,041
Bruce, wait...

244
00:16:01,708 --> 00:16:04,958
Look. Over here... 
Isn't that Bruce's?

245
00:16:05,041 --> 00:16:06,541
Yeah, that's
his all right.

246
00:16:06,625 --> 00:16:08,166
Oh, great...

247
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:11,041
I hope he hasn't gotten
himself into any trouble.

248
00:16:11,125 --> 00:16:14,958
Yeah, me too. I heard Manabu
start to call in and then stop.

249
00:16:15,041 --> 00:16:16,666
I heard
Manabu, too.

250
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:18,041
But Bruce...

251
00:16:18,125 --> 00:16:20,125
he isn't answering
his radio.

252
00:16:20,208 --> 00:16:22,458
Manabu isn't
with him. Is he?

253
00:16:22,541 --> 00:16:23,541
Yes, Sir.

254
00:16:23,625 --> 00:16:26,125
Sorry, Sir. I
should've stopped him.

255
00:16:26,208 --> 00:16:28,250
Easier said
than done...

256
00:16:28,333 --> 00:16:31,250
All right, then. Let's go back
them up before it's too late.

257
00:16:31,333 --> 00:16:32,000
[David and Louis]
Yes, Sir!

258
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:38,291
There's
no escape!

259
00:16:38,375 --> 00:16:41,000
All the remaining partitions
have been closed!

260
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:43,833
All right. Let's put
an end to this...

261
00:16:43,916 --> 00:16:45,500
Your time is
up, Death!!

262
00:16:52,208 --> 00:16:55,500
No, not again... Manabu!!

263
00:16:57,416 --> 00:16:58,875
Sorry,
Bruce.

264
00:17:00,416 --> 00:17:01,958
[Alien]
Drop the gun!

265
00:17:02,041 --> 00:17:03,916
No, Bruce!
Don't do it!

266
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,916
Do it now or he
dies! Understand?

267
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,541
Okay! I will! Just
don't kill him.

268
00:17:09,625 --> 00:17:11,833
Don't worry about
me! Shoot!!

269
00:17:11,916 --> 00:17:14,458
I can't do that.
Forgive me.

270
00:17:14,541 --> 00:17:17,958
But no one else is going
to die on my account.

271
00:17:27,583 --> 00:17:29,083
[Manabu]
Bruce!!!

272
00:17:40,625 --> 00:17:43,458
What is
this place?

273
00:17:43,541 --> 00:17:46,916
[David] Bruce? What
are you doing out here?

274
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,250
David! Is
that you?

275
00:17:49,333 --> 00:17:52,625
[Louis] I don't think
he gets it, you guys.

276
00:17:52,708 --> 00:17:53,875
Louis?

277
00:17:53,958 --> 00:17:56,625
[Yuki] Bruce, aren't you
feeling a little lonely?

278
00:17:56,708 --> 00:17:58,916
Yuki? What are
you talking about?

279
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,666
[Buldge] She means that
you're the only one

280
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:02,625
who's still
alive, Bruce.

281
00:18:02,708 --> 00:18:03,916
No! That
not true!

282
00:18:06,708 --> 00:18:13,833
Captain...! Yuki...!
Louis...! David...!

283
00:18:13,916 --> 00:18:16,833
This isn't real!
It can't be!

284
00:18:16,916 --> 00:18:19,875
[Alien] Losing all of your
friends is painful, isn't it?

285
00:18:19,958 --> 00:18:21,583
They're
not dead!

286
00:18:21,666 --> 00:18:24,666
You don't want to go through
this anymore, do you?

287
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:27,250
You want to put an end to
your life, isn't that right?

288
00:18:27,333 --> 00:18:29,958
You want to die, just like
the rest of your shipmates

289
00:18:30,041 --> 00:18:32,041
because that's the
only way to put an end

290
00:18:32,125 --> 00:18:34,041
to the guilt
and the pain.

291
00:18:34,125 --> 00:18:36,708
Don't tell me you've
killed them all!

292
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:43,541
Yeah, you're right...
I did kill them!

293
00:18:43,625 --> 00:18:46,625
It's me!

294
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:48,625
That's right. It's
all because of you.

295
00:18:48,708 --> 00:18:52,000
But with your death,
this will all end.

296
00:18:52,083 --> 00:18:53,625
With my
death?

297
00:18:53,708 --> 00:18:53,958
Isn't it the only way
to end all this torture?

298
00:18:56,791 --> 00:18:58,291
Y-Yes.

299
00:18:58,375 --> 00:19:03,166
It's okay. No more hurting.
No more pain inside.

300
00:19:06,041 --> 00:19:11,541
[Manabu]
Bruce!

301
00:19:11,625 --> 00:19:14,291
Bruce! No!

302
00:19:14,375 --> 00:19:15,416
Manabu?

303
00:19:20,041 --> 00:19:22,208
[Manabu] Bruce!
Bruce! Wake up!

304
00:19:22,291 --> 00:19:24,916
Please! Help me!
You've got to try!

305
00:19:30,708 --> 00:19:32,166
Manabu?

306
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:38,000
Don't give up, Bruce! Come on!
Do it! Bruce! Please! Do it!

307
00:19:38,083 --> 00:19:41,416
This ends now!

308
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:43,666
Go back
to hell!

309
00:19:51,666 --> 00:19:52,583
[David]
Bruce!

310
00:19:52,666 --> 00:19:53,916
[Louis]
Manabu!

311
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,916
[Buldge] Are
you two okay?

312
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,333
Yes, Sir... we're
fine... just tired.

313
00:20:04,708 --> 00:20:06,791
What is this
enormous power

314
00:20:06,875 --> 00:20:09,291
that's trying to
manipulate our destiny?

315
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:11,541
What was it trying
to accomplish?

316
00:20:11,625 --> 00:20:16,125
I don't understand.
Why can't I see?

317
00:20:19,083 --> 00:20:21,666
[Yuki] You're awake. How
are you feeling, Bruce?

318
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:23,666
Well, okay
I guess.

319
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:25,541
You inhaled a lot
of nerve gas.

320
00:20:25,625 --> 00:20:28,875
I gave you an injection
to neutralize the effect.

321
00:20:28,958 --> 00:20:30,250
You'll still need
to rest for a while

322
00:20:30,333 --> 00:20:31,708
to get you're your
strength back...

323
00:20:31,791 --> 00:20:33,625
Good. Your pulse
is normal.

324
00:20:33,708 --> 00:20:34,750
Now you've got
to promise

325
00:20:34,833 --> 00:20:36,750
that you'll take it
easy for a while.

326
00:20:36,833 --> 00:20:39,083
Oh, all
right.

327
00:20:39,166 --> 00:20:40,500
That's
better...

328
00:20:40,583 --> 00:20:43,458
Guess there was no rendezvous
with Death after all?

329
00:20:43,541 --> 00:20:46,458
I don't think Toxic Bruce
fits you anymore, do you?

330
00:20:52,875 --> 00:20:54,291
Guess not.

331
00:20:57,625 --> 00:20:59,666
Well, see
ya later.

332
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:00,458
[Bruce]
Wait...

333
00:21:05,041 --> 00:21:07,625
Thanks, Yuuki.
I owe you.

334
00:21:09,666 --> 00:21:11,958
[Narrator] After many
disagreements and conflicts,

335
00:21:12,041 --> 00:21:16,625
two men have arrived together
at an unexpected destination...

336
00:21:16,708 --> 00:21:19,458
a destination known
as friendship.

337
00:23:23,541 --> 00:23:24,708
[David] Next
time you see us,

338
00:23:24,791 --> 00:23:27,250
we'll be livin' it up at
the Miraz family spa!

339
00:23:27,333 --> 00:23:30,750
And why not? Even SDF Members
deserve a break now and then.

340
00:23:30,833 --> 00:23:32,833
While we're there, maybe
I'll soak in the hot springs

341
00:23:32,916 --> 00:23:34,625
and make some
snow-angels.

342
00:23:34,708 --> 00:23:37,000
Let's just hope there
isn't any... trouble.

343
00:23:37,083 --> 00:23:39,083
See you next time,
on the railways!
