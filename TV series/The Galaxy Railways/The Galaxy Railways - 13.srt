1
00:01:41,416 --> 00:01:44,208
Among the Galaxy
Railways trains,

2
00:01:44,291 --> 00:01:48,125
there is one that has no
destination scheduled;

3
00:01:48,208 --> 00:01:50,166
not even its
next stop.

4
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:52,708
It is the fate of the
passengers on board

5
00:01:52,791 --> 00:01:56,916
that determines the route
of the 777 Express.

6
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,250
This mystical train
brings each passenger

7
00:02:00,333 --> 00:02:04,250
to a place that is along the
path of their own destiny.

8
00:02:04,333 --> 00:02:07,416
Those who ride it are
people who are disatisfied

9
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:10,583
with not knowing what the
future holds for them;

10
00:02:10,666 --> 00:02:12,708
people who are
searching for the key

11
00:02:12,791 --> 00:02:16,208
that will unlock the mystery
of their own fate...

12
00:02:16,291 --> 00:02:21,041
But occasionally someone
boards the 777 by accident.

13
00:02:21,125 --> 00:02:25,083
Or is there such a thing in
this life as an accident?

14
00:02:33,083 --> 00:02:34,916
Manabu, you'd
better hurry up!

15
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,041
You're going to
miss your train!

16
00:02:37,125 --> 00:02:38,333
What are you
doing up there?

17
00:02:38,416 --> 00:02:39,666
I'm packing.

18
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:41,750
They might not give
you another vacation

19
00:02:41,833 --> 00:02:43,541
if you're late getting
back from this one!

20
00:02:43,625 --> 00:02:45,333
Now get your
rear in gear!

21
00:02:45,416 --> 00:02:48,166
All right! All
right! I'm coming!

22
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:50,000
Please be
safe, Manabu.

23
00:02:50,083 --> 00:02:52,541
I will, Mom.
I love you!

24
00:02:54,208 --> 00:02:56,500
He'll be
back, Shutaro.

25
00:02:59,083 --> 00:03:01,166
Wait!
One more!

26
00:03:09,333 --> 00:03:11,250
Made it. The Five-fifty
is supposed to go

27
00:03:11,333 --> 00:03:13,541
straight to
Destiny Station.

28
00:03:30,416 --> 00:03:33,333
Great. I'm going to be late
from my first vacation.

29
00:03:33,416 --> 00:03:36,666
I'll be cleaning
trains for weeks.

30
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:37,541
Oh. Good.

31
00:03:37,625 --> 00:03:39,208
Uh. Excuse me.

32
00:03:39,291 --> 00:03:41,916
Yes, good day, Sir.
Can I be of assistance?

33
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,625
Yeah. Does this train
stop at Destiny Station?

34
00:03:44,708 --> 00:03:48,041
Destiny Station...? Well,
I can't say for sure, Sir.

35
00:03:48,125 --> 00:03:49,375
But if you
stay on board,

36
00:03:49,458 --> 00:03:51,916
I'd say there's a pretty
good chance that it might.

37
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,833
Look, just tell me
where our next stop is

38
00:03:53,916 --> 00:03:55,625
and how long 'til
we get there.

39
00:03:55,708 --> 00:03:57,750
Where this train stops
next is our next stop.

40
00:03:57,833 --> 00:03:59,875
And we'll arrive
when we get there.

41
00:03:59,958 --> 00:04:01,666
It was a
serious question.

42
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:04,750
Yes, Sir. And I provided
you with a serious answer.

43
00:04:04,833 --> 00:04:07,291
I wish I had more information
for you but I don't.

44
00:04:07,375 --> 00:04:10,500
That's the nature of
riding the 777 Express.

45
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:12,166
What? You're
kidding me!

46
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:14,833
I didn't think the
777 really existed.

47
00:04:14,916 --> 00:04:15,833
Yes, Sir.

48
00:04:15,916 --> 00:04:17,583
I've heard all
about this train.

49
00:04:17,666 --> 00:04:20,708
It has no destination;
no terminal station;

50
00:04:20,791 --> 00:04:24,833
its track keeps extending.
So it really exists after all.

51
00:04:24,916 --> 00:04:26,666
I just assumed
that it was a myth.

52
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:29,000
No, Sir! We're here
and we're ready to serve!

53
00:04:29,083 --> 00:04:30,375
I hope you enjoy
your flight!

54
00:04:30,458 --> 00:04:32,500
Aw, man! Am
I in trouble!

55
00:04:32,583 --> 00:04:33,666
Sir?

56
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:35,000
I'm supposed to be
back at headquarters.

57
00:04:35,083 --> 00:04:36,333
I got on
by mistake...

58
00:04:36,416 --> 00:04:40,041
Was it a mistake...?
Or was it your destiny?

59
00:04:40,125 --> 00:04:41,375
I'm starting
to believe

60
00:04:41,458 --> 00:04:43,416
that there are no such
things as mistakes Manabu.

61
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:44,541
It's all fate...

62
00:04:44,625 --> 00:04:45,750
Huh?!

63
00:04:45,833 --> 00:04:47,958
Is this man an acquaintance
of yours, Sir?

64
00:04:48,041 --> 00:04:51,166
Saboru?!
...Is that you?!

65
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:03,333
[Bully]
Get 'em!

66
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
[Bully 2] Damn!
You're crazy, kid!

67
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:21,916
Let's see that curve
ball of yours, Manabu!

68
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,041
Okay!

69
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:26,541
Not bad!

70
00:05:26,625 --> 00:05:30,416
Thanks! Hey, why don't we
all join the SDF when grow up?

71
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:31,666
I'll be
the Captain.

72
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:33,041
Mamoru, you and Saboru
can be on my crew.

73
00:05:33,125 --> 00:05:37,375
No way! One of us should
be the Captain! We're older!

74
00:05:37,458 --> 00:05:38,875
I think
I'll pass.

75
00:05:40,416 --> 00:05:42,250
I don't want to join
the Space Defense Force.

76
00:05:42,333 --> 00:05:44,250
I want to
be a painter.

77
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:51,416
I want to travel the Galaxy
just as much as you guys

78
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,666
only I want to do it
with my sketchbook.

79
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:55,750
After I draw all
the amazing sights,

80
00:05:55,833 --> 00:05:59,166
I'll come back to Tabito and
become a famous painter.

81
00:06:03,916 --> 00:06:05,750
Hey, that's your
sketchbook, isn't it?

82
00:06:05,833 --> 00:06:07,750
Cool! Can I
have a look?

83
00:06:10,083 --> 00:06:12,208
Aw, yeah.
These are nice...

84
00:06:12,291 --> 00:06:15,291
Man, Saboru, you've
really gotten good.

85
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:18,791
These will make great
paintings! This is your dream!

86
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:26,708
They're all blank...
Are you okay?

87
00:06:26,791 --> 00:06:30,500
Why did you stop, Saboru? Did
something happen? What's up?

88
00:06:30,583 --> 00:06:32,416
I started
thinking.

89
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:33,958
What do
you mean?

90
00:06:34,041 --> 00:06:36,083
What's the purpose
of it all, Manabu?

91
00:06:36,166 --> 00:06:38,166
Our fate has already
been decided.

92
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:40,625
Why live life if
we're not in control?

93
00:06:40,708 --> 00:06:42,125
If we're only acting
out something

94
00:06:42,208 --> 00:06:46,000
that's been pre-determined?
It's not worth it.

95
00:06:46,083 --> 00:06:48,208
Of course
it's worth it!

96
00:07:23,416 --> 00:07:24,833
Receiving an
Emergency Transmission

97
00:07:24,916 --> 00:07:27,708
from the
777 Express!

98
00:07:27,791 --> 00:07:28,958
[777 Conductor] I don't
know what's happening!

99
00:07:29,041 --> 00:07:30,958
Only three coaches are
attached to the engine!

100
00:07:31,041 --> 00:07:34,375
The other six are
missing! Please...

101
00:07:34,458 --> 00:07:37,875
Communications are
down! We've lost them!

102
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:40,541
Quickly! Dispatch
Sirius and Spica!

103
00:07:40,625 --> 00:07:42,125
Headquarters! Come
in! Can you hear me?!

104
00:07:42,208 --> 00:07:44,333
Please come in!
We need help!

105
00:07:44,416 --> 00:07:48,166
Emergency dispatch requested!
Sirius Platoon! Spica Platoon!

106
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:49,666
Take off
immediately!

107
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:53,333
The 777s ID Signal
has disappeared!

108
00:07:53,416 --> 00:07:56,708
The 777 isn't supposed
to be lost yet.

109
00:07:56,791 --> 00:07:59,291
A dark force is trying
to disturb the order

110
00:07:59,375 --> 00:08:03,875
of our Universe. We cannot
allow it to alter our Destiny.

111
00:08:03,958 --> 00:08:07,083
Yes, Shula...
I understand.

112
00:08:13,833 --> 00:08:15,333
The train's drifting!
What's going on?

113
00:08:15,416 --> 00:08:17,458
We've derailed, Sir!
We're being pulled!

114
00:08:17,541 --> 00:08:18,958
Pulled
by what?!

115
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:22,208
A Spatiotemporal Planet! We're
in its gravitational pull!

116
00:08:26,416 --> 00:08:29,250
There are no Spatiotemporal
Planets near Tabito!

117
00:08:29,333 --> 00:08:31,958
But if we're not near
Tabito, where are we?!

118
00:08:39,166 --> 00:08:41,333
We're under
attack!

119
00:08:41,416 --> 00:08:44,750
By who?! None of
this makes any sense!

120
00:08:44,833 --> 00:08:45,583
Here! Put
this on!

121
00:08:49,166 --> 00:08:51,000
What's the use? We
can't escape it.

122
00:08:51,083 --> 00:08:52,333
Escape
what?!

123
00:08:52,416 --> 00:08:54,458
Our fate. This is
the triple seven...

124
00:08:54,541 --> 00:08:57,708
If this train took us
here, this is our destiny.

125
00:08:57,791 --> 00:08:59,125
So, you're just going
to let them kill you

126
00:08:59,208 --> 00:09:01,333
without putting
up a fight?!

127
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:05,666
Can a man win a fight
against his own Fate?

128
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:07,916
I've seen others fight death
against impossible odds

129
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,333
with every breath
in their body!

130
00:09:11,416 --> 00:09:14,625
Come on man, what's
the matter with you?!

131
00:09:14,708 --> 00:09:16,375
Where's the Saboru
I used to know?!

132
00:09:16,458 --> 00:09:17,875
The one with
a heart!

133
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:44,000
This darkness; it's
not from our Universe.

134
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:46,000
They're from
another dimension.

135
00:09:46,083 --> 00:09:48,166
Yes. But what are
their intentions?

136
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:50,333
Why the 777?

137
00:09:50,416 --> 00:09:54,541
I don't know.
Why can't we see?

138
00:09:59,291 --> 00:10:01,125
This is the
777 Express!

139
00:10:01,208 --> 00:10:03,500
Please stop your
attack! We are unarmed!

140
00:10:03,583 --> 00:10:07,208
This is a civilian vessel!
Please hold your fire!

141
00:10:27,625 --> 00:10:30,000
We can't just let ourselves
be pulled into that Planet.

142
00:10:30,083 --> 00:10:32,583
We've got to try going
backwards! Full reverse!

143
00:10:32,666 --> 00:10:34,541
We need all the
power we can get!

144
00:10:34,625 --> 00:10:35,375
[777 Conductor]
Yes, Sir!!

145
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:08,875
Here they come!
Quick! Get down!

146
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:11,708
It's no use,
Manabu... Why resist?

147
00:11:11,791 --> 00:11:13,458
This is the way it
was meant to be.

148
00:11:13,541 --> 00:11:17,083
What are you talking about?!
Who knows how this'll end?!

149
00:11:17,166 --> 00:11:19,541
We might not make it out of
here! But we've got to try!

150
00:11:19,625 --> 00:11:23,375
We've got to fight, Saboru!
You can't just give up on life!

151
00:11:23,458 --> 00:11:24,958
What about
your dream?!

152
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:27,666
Headquarters!
Do you read me?

153
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:31,750
This is the 777! We are under
attack! Please send help!

154
00:11:35,083 --> 00:11:37,541
Don't you see? Fate
drew us both here!

155
00:11:37,625 --> 00:11:39,750
It doesn't matter what
we try to do, Manabu!

156
00:11:39,833 --> 00:11:43,833
We can't change our destiny.
Why can't you accept that?!

157
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,458
If I accept it then I'm dead.
I want to live! Don't you?!

158
00:11:50,541 --> 00:11:54,666
Sir! It's useless!
I can't get through!

159
00:11:58,875 --> 00:12:00,458
[Alien language] Are
there only three?

160
00:12:00,541 --> 00:12:03,458
Don't underestimate them.

161
00:12:03,541 --> 00:12:04,458
Be efficient.
Slaughter them.

162
00:12:04,541 --> 00:12:05,541
Yes, Sir!

163
00:12:08,958 --> 00:12:11,333
Saboru!
Calm down!

164
00:12:11,416 --> 00:12:13,625
Hey, Conductor. Take
him to the front car.

165
00:12:13,708 --> 00:12:14,708
Y-Yes,
Sir!

166
00:12:16,583 --> 00:12:17,875
Please, Sir!
This way!

167
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:34,541
Good shot,
Sir!

168
00:12:35,375 --> 00:12:43,166
Go, Saboru! Get
out of here! Now!

169
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:43,916
Manabu.

170
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,625
Go! Now!
Do it!

171
00:12:45,708 --> 00:12:46,958
Please,
Sir! Hurry!

172
00:12:47,041 --> 00:12:48,500
But...

173
00:12:55,875 --> 00:13:02,791
Manabu... Why can't I sense
your spirit...? Where are you?

174
00:13:02,875 --> 00:13:05,166
Commander! Our radar
has picked up a train

175
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:07,708
six thousand mega-meters
from the Tabito System!

176
00:13:07,791 --> 00:13:09,583
Identify it
immediately!

177
00:13:09,666 --> 00:13:12,916
Identity confirmed!
It's the 777, Sir!

178
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,750
The main engine and
three of the front cars

179
00:13:14,833 --> 00:13:16,791
are unaccounted
for, Commander!

180
00:13:16,875 --> 00:13:19,916
Rescue any survivors! Find
the front end of that train!

181
00:13:27,541 --> 00:13:31,041
Urgent news from Headquarters!
They've found it!

182
00:13:31,125 --> 00:13:32,541
The 777
is adrift

183
00:13:32,625 --> 00:13:35,750
six thousand mega-meters
from the Tabito System!

184
00:13:35,833 --> 00:13:37,375
Spica Platoon is
just now arriving

185
00:13:37,458 --> 00:13:40,083
at the accident
scene, Captain!

186
00:13:40,166 --> 00:13:43,541
Sir! They're beginning rescue
operations as we speak!

187
00:13:47,041 --> 00:13:49,333
This is Spica
Platoon reporting.

188
00:13:49,416 --> 00:13:52,458
The rescue operation
is 80% complete... However,

189
00:13:52,541 --> 00:13:55,083
The conductor and some of the
passengers are unaccounted for.

190
00:13:55,166 --> 00:13:57,250
An SDF member who
boarded at Tabito

191
00:13:57,333 --> 00:13:58,291
is among the
missing passengers.

192
00:13:59,708 --> 00:14:01,125
Manabu.

193
00:14:01,208 --> 00:14:03,166
That idiot!

194
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:06,083
Look sharp platoon! This
mission is far from over!

195
00:14:06,166 --> 00:14:08,750
We've got to locate the engine
and the missing passenger cars.

196
00:14:08,833 --> 00:14:11,041
We'll continue to sweep the
area until we find them.

197
00:14:11,125 --> 00:14:12,458
[All]
Yes, Sir!

198
00:14:12,541 --> 00:14:16,125
This is the 777 Express!
Headquarters! Please come in!

199
00:14:46,208 --> 00:14:49,250
Sorry. You leave
me no choice.

200
00:14:49,333 --> 00:14:52,500
Oh, no! I hope
he's not hurt!

201
00:14:52,583 --> 00:14:56,333
Sir! Thank goodness you're all
right! I thought you were dead!

202
00:14:56,416 --> 00:14:58,083
You've
been hit!

203
00:14:58,166 --> 00:15:01,291
I'm okay.

204
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:03,666
Saboru! What's the
matter? Are you all right?

205
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:05,416
No! Of course I'm
not all right!

206
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:08,541
I'm about to be butchered
by aliens! How can I be?

207
00:15:13,041 --> 00:15:15,000
There's nothing we can do!
They're going to kill us!

208
00:15:15,083 --> 00:15:16,916
It's our
destiny, Manabu.

209
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:21,125
You don't know that! Maybe
we're supposed to survive!

210
00:15:21,208 --> 00:15:23,458
Go ahead and do
it, Manabu! Hit me!

211
00:15:23,541 --> 00:15:25,375
Maybe I should! It
might wake you up

212
00:15:25,458 --> 00:15:27,666
from this coma you've
gotten yourself into!

213
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:33,375
Sir! The door!
It's melting!

214
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:37,791
Look out!!

215
00:15:47,541 --> 00:15:49,625
The power's cut off!
What's going on?

216
00:15:49,708 --> 00:15:52,458
Over there, Sir! They've
hit the main power line!

217
00:15:52,541 --> 00:15:53,875
We've got
to fix it.

218
00:15:58,208 --> 00:15:59,750
We've got to
connect these.

219
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:01,041
Not with your
bare hands!

220
00:16:05,125 --> 00:16:09,375
Manabu... Why do you try so
hard to do the impossible?

221
00:16:09,458 --> 00:16:12,625
Why can't you just accept that
this was all meant to be?!

222
00:16:12,708 --> 00:16:15,708
Remember when those bullies
surrounded us on Tabito?

223
00:16:15,791 --> 00:16:18,458
We didn't just accept that we
were going to get beat up;

224
00:16:18,541 --> 00:16:21,500
that it was our destiny.
We fought back and we won!

225
00:16:22,833 --> 00:16:26,125
Mamoru never gave up. He
gave it everything he had.

226
00:16:26,208 --> 00:16:28,375
He challenged his
fate to the very end.

227
00:16:28,458 --> 00:16:29,791
What?!
Mamoru's dead?!

228
00:16:29,875 --> 00:16:33,500
Yeah! Mamoru's dead but
you're still alive, Saboru!

229
00:16:33,583 --> 00:16:35,833
You have everything to live
for! You can't give up!

230
00:16:35,916 --> 00:16:38,333
What about your dream of
becoming a great painter?

231
00:16:38,416 --> 00:16:41,041
Don't just throw that
away! It's your life!

232
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:43,000
You've got to fight for
it! We'll do it together!

233
00:16:43,083 --> 00:16:48,083
We'll fight side by side!
Just like in the old days!

234
00:16:48,166 --> 00:16:50,791
All right,
Manabu... Lead on.

235
00:16:50,875 --> 00:16:54,458
Look out!!

236
00:16:54,541 --> 00:16:56,000
Manabu!
Cover me!

237
00:17:01,166 --> 00:17:03,250
Conductor...
Are you all right?

238
00:17:03,333 --> 00:17:07,750
No... vital circuits... 
damaged... Here, Sir...

239
00:17:07,833 --> 00:17:12,166
This is yours... Please. Don't
let them take it from you.

240
00:17:14,541 --> 00:17:20,458
I won't. I promise. I won't
let them take my dream!

241
00:17:24,375 --> 00:17:26,250
Saboru! No! What
are you doing?!

242
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Saboru! Why
did you...

243
00:17:45,083 --> 00:17:50,916
Saboru...
Saboru!!!

244
00:17:52,916 --> 00:17:54,708
Louis. Any
further reports

245
00:17:54,791 --> 00:17:56,791
on the missing
part of the 777?

246
00:17:56,875 --> 00:18:00,250
Negative... All channels
are open. Nothing so far, Sir.

247
00:18:00,333 --> 00:18:02,000
Damn! This
is crazy!

248
00:18:02,083 --> 00:18:04,500
How can an engine and three
cars vanish into thin air?!

249
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:07,041
Keep trying to
reach the 777!

250
00:18:07,125 --> 00:18:08,875
Maximize
frequency range!

251
00:18:08,958 --> 00:18:11,208
Yes,
Captain!

252
00:18:11,291 --> 00:18:13,041
This is the 777
Express. Please come in.

253
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:14,250
It's
Manabu!

254
00:18:14,333 --> 00:18:15,166
We need immediate
assistance. Do you read?

255
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:16,166
It's
really him!

256
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:17,625
That's
my boy!

257
00:18:17,708 --> 00:18:19,125
Locate that
transmission!

258
00:18:19,208 --> 00:18:20,625
Prepare for an
emergency rescue!

259
00:18:20,708 --> 00:18:21,791
Yes, Captain!

260
00:18:21,875 --> 00:18:25,041
Somebody! Please...
We're under attack!

261
00:18:37,333 --> 00:18:40,083
Father! What am
I going to do?!

262
00:18:54,875 --> 00:19:03,291
Manabu... Manabu, it's over.
Everything is all right.

263
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:04,625
Supreme
Commander...

264
00:19:04,708 --> 00:19:08,125
Everything is as it should
be thanks to you Manabu.

265
00:19:10,291 --> 00:19:12,583
Come, let
us go...

266
00:19:12,666 --> 00:19:16,791
I am Destiny.
I am Shula.

267
00:19:31,458 --> 00:19:32,625
[Cadet] Sirius
Platoon is reporting

268
00:19:32,708 --> 00:19:34,500
that they've
found the 777!

269
00:19:34,583 --> 00:19:36,791
Two passengers have
been rescued safely!

270
00:19:49,916 --> 00:19:53,500
What an ordeal. It feels good
just to be alive, doesn't it?

271
00:19:53,583 --> 00:19:56,291
Manabu...
I owe you.

272
00:19:56,375 --> 00:19:57,416
Paint me
a picture.

273
00:19:58,208 --> 00:19:59,291
Manabu.

274
00:19:59,375 --> 00:20:01,458
Take good care of
him for me, Yuki.

275
00:20:01,541 --> 00:20:02,875
I will.

276
00:20:06,583 --> 00:20:08,375
Thanks for
everything, Manabu!

277
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:10,375
No problem.
Hang in there.

278
00:20:14,583 --> 00:20:16,000
Manabu.

279
00:20:16,083 --> 00:20:17,125
Way to go!

280
00:20:17,208 --> 00:20:18,625
You did
it, Manabu!

281
00:20:18,708 --> 00:20:21,166
Hmm!

282
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:23,833
Well done, Manabu. I'm
glad you're all right.

283
00:20:23,916 --> 00:20:25,625
Thank you,
Captain.

284
00:20:25,708 --> 00:20:27,916
It's been quite a
homecoming, hasn't it?

285
00:20:28,916 --> 00:20:32,875
What is this mystery
known as destiny?

286
00:20:32,958 --> 00:20:34,958
Is the path of a man
truly determined

287
00:20:35,041 --> 00:20:37,166
before he ever
takes birth?

288
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:39,041
Has his every footstep
already been made

289
00:20:39,125 --> 00:20:43,000
before he ever learns
to walk? Perhaps...

290
00:20:43,083 --> 00:20:45,875
For some this possibility
is used as an excuse

291
00:20:45,958 --> 00:20:48,333
to give up on
life; for others,

292
00:20:48,416 --> 00:20:52,000
it is the comfort they
need to strive even harder.

293
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:57,500
It was you who came to me
on the 777 and saved me.

294
00:20:57,583 --> 00:20:59,166
Wasn't it?

295
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:01,625
That was Shula.
I am Layla.

296
00:21:01,708 --> 00:21:05,708
But I was there as well.
The two of us are one.

297
00:21:06,583 --> 00:21:09,541
I know I seem like a
mystery to you, Manabu.

298
00:21:09,625 --> 00:21:12,291
But you, too, are
a mystery to me...

299
00:21:12,375 --> 00:21:15,166
You see, sometimes I
lose sight of your Fate

300
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:17,500
and I... I don't
know why...

301
00:21:17,583 --> 00:21:22,250
I often wonder what this
means to our Universe.

302
00:21:22,333 --> 00:21:26,500
Don't be concerned...
Just... follow your heart.

303
00:21:26,583 --> 00:21:29,875
It hasn't steered
you wrong yet.

304
00:21:34,208 --> 00:21:36,125
[Woman] It's time,
Mr. President.

305
00:21:36,208 --> 00:21:37,750
Very well.

306
00:23:24,583 --> 00:23:26,625
Our next mission is to
guard President Drake

307
00:23:26,708 --> 00:23:30,166
of the Clarious Stellar
Cluster-also known as my Dad;

308
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:32,000
the worst Father
