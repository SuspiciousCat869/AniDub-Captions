1
00:01:49,125 --> 00:01:51,708
Harga Lou... a planet
where normal tourism

2
00:01:51,791 --> 00:01:53,458
is virtually
non-existent;

3
00:01:53,541 --> 00:01:56,541
the result of constant
extreme winter weather.

4
00:01:56,625 --> 00:01:59,333
However, somewhere
on this frigid planet,

5
00:01:59,416 --> 00:02:02,541
the most beautiful jewel
in the universe exists.

6
00:02:11,416 --> 00:02:13,000
For that
reason alone,

7
00:02:13,083 --> 00:02:15,291
many treasure hunters have
traveled to Harga Lou

8
00:02:15,375 --> 00:02:18,833
in the hopes of finding
this fabled, precious jewel.

9
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:22,666
But to this day,
none of these seekers

10
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:24,583
have ever made it
back from alive.

11
00:02:32,125 --> 00:02:33,458
[Louis] Captain, we've
just received word

12
00:02:33,541 --> 00:02:35,125
that a small
spacecraft has crashed

13
00:02:35,208 --> 00:02:38,083
ten kilometers from
the station on Harga Lou.

14
00:02:38,166 --> 00:02:40,250
Affirmative. Let's
head that way.

15
00:03:22,125 --> 00:03:24,125
[Woman] Who are you?!
What do you want?!

16
00:04:01,833 --> 00:04:05,000
Miss, are you all right?
Miss, can you hear me?

17
00:04:05,083 --> 00:04:09,333
Irene? I don't
believe it.

18
00:04:18,916 --> 00:04:20,125
Where am I?

19
00:04:20,208 --> 00:04:21,583
You're
safe now.

20
00:04:21,666 --> 00:04:24,125
An SDF search party found
you unconscious in the snow.

21
00:04:24,208 --> 00:04:26,708
You suffered superficial
wounds but you'll be all right.

22
00:04:26,791 --> 00:04:28,291
So don't
worry.

23
00:04:28,375 --> 00:04:30,666
Well, it's has been
a while, Irene.

24
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:33,166
It can't
be...

25
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:34,416
Hey, Are
you alright?

26
00:04:37,916 --> 00:04:39,541
Now let me guess...
you came here

27
00:04:39,625 --> 00:04:41,708
looking for
treasure?

28
00:04:41,791 --> 00:04:45,375
Beautiful... You haven't
changed one bit...

29
00:04:45,458 --> 00:04:49,125
I knew one day
we'd meet again.

30
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:57,791
The official account is
that they got into trouble

31
00:04:57,875 --> 00:05:00,083
while attempting a
landing and crashed...

32
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:02,541
Fortunately, the flight
recorder managed to document

33
00:05:02,625 --> 00:05:04,250
the events leading
up to the incident.

34
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:08,166
Look! There's
something there!

35
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:10,625
Would you rewind
the tape...?

36
00:05:10,708 --> 00:05:12,375
There, see!?

37
00:05:12,458 --> 00:05:15,041
The people here have stuck with
old-fashioned ways of life.

38
00:05:15,125 --> 00:05:18,000
That could be
a local guard.

39
00:05:18,083 --> 00:05:20,416
Because of all the ancient
monuments found here,

40
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,083
Harga Lou has been
categorized as a

41
00:05:22,166 --> 00:05:23,958
Class One Historical
Sanctuary

42
00:05:24,041 --> 00:05:26,208
by Galaxy Railways
Headquarters.

43
00:05:26,291 --> 00:05:27,750
But most of the
people who visit

44
00:05:27,833 --> 00:05:30,000
come for a
different reason.

45
00:05:30,083 --> 00:05:32,500
[Louis] Isn't a treasure
supposed to be hidden here?

46
00:05:32,583 --> 00:05:33,666
That's right.

47
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,375
The most beautiful
jewel in the universe-

48
00:05:35,458 --> 00:05:37,291
the Blue Flame
of Isperil.

49
00:05:37,375 --> 00:05:39,875
Most scholars agree that
it's buried in a ravine here

50
00:05:39,958 --> 00:05:41,916
known as the
Caldron of Annuve.

51
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,750
The Blue Flame
of Isperil?

52
00:05:43,833 --> 00:05:45,875
Legend has it that
whoever possesses the gem

53
00:05:45,958 --> 00:05:49,000
will have eternal beauty.
It's all nonsense.

54
00:05:49,083 --> 00:05:50,333
Where do you think
you're going?

55
00:05:50,416 --> 00:05:52,750
It's okay, Bruce.
Just let him be.

56
00:05:52,833 --> 00:05:55,583
We can't let her go because
she's under investigation.

57
00:05:55,666 --> 00:05:58,416
Once we drop her off at
headquarters, he'll be fine.

58
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:11,916
Taking off so soon?
It's been seven years

59
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,500
and you're leaving without
even saying good-bye?

60
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,458
Let go of me! Just who
do you think you are?!

61
00:06:17,541 --> 00:06:19,666
You mean you don't remember?
Now, isn't that a pity.

62
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:20,833
Well perhaps
you'll remember

63
00:06:20,916 --> 00:06:22,166
the one million Ables
you stole from me?

64
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:25,083
That rang a
bell, didn't it?

65
00:06:25,166 --> 00:06:27,791
David, forgive me!
I'm so sorry.

66
00:06:27,875 --> 00:06:31,500
I never meant to hurt
you... But you knew that.

67
00:06:31,583 --> 00:06:33,041
There hasn't been a
day that's gone by

68
00:06:33,125 --> 00:06:36,958
that I haven't thought about
you. Oh David, I do love you.

69
00:06:37,041 --> 00:06:39,083
It's just
that I- I...

70
00:06:39,166 --> 00:06:39,958
I need
your gun!

71
00:06:41,291 --> 00:06:43,000
Thanks! Look, it'll never
work out between us,

72
00:06:43,083 --> 00:06:46,250
trust me! But I guess
you knew that too.

73
00:06:46,333 --> 00:06:47,166
Goodbye
David.

74
00:06:51,666 --> 00:06:52,833
You let her
get away?

75
00:06:52,916 --> 00:06:55,833
Don't tell me you're
still not over her yet.

76
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:57,166
She dodged me
for seven years;

77
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:58,166
You don't think I'd
let her get away

78
00:06:58,250 --> 00:06:59,666
as easily as
that, do you?

79
00:07:02,333 --> 00:07:05,250
So, What d'ya say we bet on
it Bruce? One million Ables;

80
00:07:05,333 --> 00:07:07,250
if I can get Irene
back in one piece.

81
00:07:07,333 --> 00:07:10,458
I'm no fool! She might
get shot before then!

82
00:07:47,416 --> 00:07:49,541
That knight must be the
guardian of the jewel.

83
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:03,291
Help me! Please,
somebody... help me!

84
00:08:06,666 --> 00:08:10,083
Open the door!
Please! Hurry!

85
00:08:10,166 --> 00:08:11,833
Please
let me in!

86
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:26,291
Thanks, mister.
You saved my life...

87
00:08:26,375 --> 00:08:28,375
All right, treasure hunter-
if you want to live

88
00:08:28,458 --> 00:08:30,625
then I suggest you stay
quiet and come with me.

89
00:08:30,708 --> 00:08:35,333
uh... No thanks I do
just fine on my own...

90
00:08:35,416 --> 00:08:38,208
Don't take this
personally, old man.

91
00:08:45,375 --> 00:08:48,000
[Manabu] So what's up with you
and this Irene lady, David?

92
00:08:48,083 --> 00:08:49,958
[David] That's none of
your business, Manabu.

93
00:08:50,041 --> 00:08:52,625
Her name's Irene Summer and
she's under investigation.

94
00:08:52,708 --> 00:08:54,000
That's all you
need to know.

95
00:08:54,083 --> 00:08:55,833
[Bruce] And she left
David seven years ago

96
00:08:55,916 --> 00:08:58,000
and took a million of
his Ables with her.

97
00:08:58,083 --> 00:09:00,208
Now that's what I call
a talented woman!

98
00:09:00,291 --> 00:09:03,375
I can't wait to meet her! So
was it love at first sight?

99
00:09:03,458 --> 00:09:04,458
How did you
two meet?!

100
00:09:04,541 --> 00:09:06,291
Stop it, Louis!

101
00:09:06,375 --> 00:09:07,625
Oh, don't
worry about it.

102
00:09:07,708 --> 00:09:10,083
I don't want David to go
over all the gory details.

103
00:09:10,166 --> 00:09:12,541
Although, I'm sure it must
have been very painful.

104
00:09:12,625 --> 00:09:15,166
You know, I envy you for having
such a thrilling romance!

105
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:16,833
How
awesome!

106
00:09:16,916 --> 00:09:18,041
[Bruce] Aw! Go
ahead, David!

107
00:09:18,125 --> 00:09:20,291
Tell Louis the
whole story! Why not?

108
00:09:20,375 --> 00:09:21,958
[David] Oh, cut me
a break, will ya?

109
00:09:22,041 --> 00:09:26,250
[Louis] I get it now! David's
shy! I would've never guessed!

110
00:09:52,583 --> 00:09:53,708
You're home
early tonight.

111
00:09:53,791 --> 00:09:56,333
How did the hunting
go, Lady Morgana?

112
00:09:56,416 --> 00:09:59,041
It was a waste of
time! Just four rats!

113
00:09:59,125 --> 00:10:01,041
Not even enough to
feed the Macha Ravens!

114
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:07,875
[Louis] What a
magnificent castle.

115
00:10:07,958 --> 00:10:09,375
I wonder who
lives here.

116
00:10:09,458 --> 00:10:10,708
[Manabu]
I don't know,

117
00:10:10,791 --> 00:10:13,208
but it's awfully late to be
knocking, isn't it?

118
00:10:13,291 --> 00:10:14,375
[Bruce] How do you
know she's in here?

119
00:10:14,458 --> 00:10:15,750
The signal stopped.

120
00:10:15,833 --> 00:10:17,291
[David] This is the
only place around.

121
00:10:19,333 --> 00:10:22,416
The castle is closed
come back in the morning!

122
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,166
An aircraft went
down near here.

123
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:26,250
We think one of the
survivors might be inside.

124
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:38,583
My name is Kenderick, the chief
knight of Gusfantail Castle...

125
00:10:38,666 --> 00:10:41,250
Perhaps it would be better
if you spoke to Lady Morgana

126
00:10:41,333 --> 00:10:42,833
regarding
this matter.

127
00:10:42,916 --> 00:10:45,083
Come this way.

128
00:10:45,166 --> 00:10:47,750
Please
wait here.

129
00:10:47,833 --> 00:10:50,166
[Filidh] Poor,
unfortunate travelers.

130
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:53,583
So many come to seek,
but none ever leave.

131
00:10:53,666 --> 00:10:57,041
The Blue Flame of
Isperil is cursed.

132
00:10:57,125 --> 00:10:59,750
Put it on, and you
end up being its slave.

133
00:11:01,458 --> 00:11:04,666
So you- who go to- the
jewel- will be ruled-

134
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:07,791
by the Blue, Blue
Flame of Isperil.

135
00:11:14,125 --> 00:11:17,750
You who sail among the stars;
welcome to my humble castle.

136
00:11:34,708 --> 00:11:37,166
How do you feel now,
treasure hunter?

137
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:41,291
Was it worth coming all the way
out here for the Blue Flame...?

138
00:11:41,375 --> 00:11:43,750
All of your shipmates
are dead by now...

139
00:11:43,833 --> 00:11:45,125
The Macha Ravens
are feasting

140
00:11:45,208 --> 00:11:48,416
on their lifeless carcasses
even as we speak.

141
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:54,125
Should I kill you now...?
Or should I let you go free?

142
00:11:54,208 --> 00:11:57,041
I take no pleasure in
killing beautiful women.

143
00:11:57,125 --> 00:12:00,375
I despise the greed in your
heart that brought you here

144
00:12:00,458 --> 00:12:03,166
but... I admire
your bravery.

145
00:12:05,375 --> 00:12:07,750
So what do I owe
you for my freedom?

146
00:12:07,833 --> 00:12:11,000
You owe me nothing. If you
really want the Blue Flame,

147
00:12:11,083 --> 00:12:14,083
make your way to the
Caldron of Annuve...

148
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:17,291
Follow this hallway and it
will lead you to what you seek.

149
00:12:21,833 --> 00:12:24,916
So this Irene- the woman
who survived the crash-

150
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,666
she's the one
you're looking for?

151
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:28,083
That's right.

152
00:12:28,166 --> 00:12:29,500
It would appear that Irene
was chased to your castle

153
00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:31,041
by some men
on horseback.

154
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:32,375
That's what we're
guessing in any case,

155
00:12:32,458 --> 00:12:35,791
judging by the tracks that
we followed in the snow.

156
00:12:35,875 --> 00:12:38,583
We were also following her
with this tracking device.

157
00:12:38,666 --> 00:12:41,500
But we lost the signal when
we got close to your castle.

158
00:12:41,583 --> 00:12:44,416
This is the only place that
she could've found refuge.

159
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:46,583
Well it's obvious that
your device is broken.

160
00:12:46,666 --> 00:12:48,791
Now if you'll excuse
me, it's getting late.

161
00:12:51,083 --> 00:12:52,041
[Manabu]
Bruce! Look!

162
00:12:52,125 --> 00:12:55,041
It's working...
So she is in here!

163
00:12:55,125 --> 00:12:56,333
[David] And she's
on the move!

164
00:13:02,791 --> 00:13:04,083
It's a trap!

165
00:13:10,833 --> 00:13:12,791
I don't trust
that guy.

166
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:14,791
I wonder if the jewel's
really down here.

167
00:13:24,041 --> 00:13:25,708
Stop it,
Morgana!

168
00:13:25,791 --> 00:13:28,000
I don't want to
kill anyone anymore!

169
00:13:28,083 --> 00:13:31,791
Tie me up before it's too
late! No! Just kill me!

170
00:13:31,875 --> 00:13:34,458
Lady Morgana it doesn't
have to end that way.

171
00:13:34,541 --> 00:13:37,041
There must be something we
can do to lift the curse.

172
00:13:37,125 --> 00:13:38,250
There has
to be!

173
00:13:38,333 --> 00:13:40,708
Change my
fate...? But how?

174
00:13:40,791 --> 00:13:43,750
The way I see it, you're merely
a prisoner of the jewel...

175
00:13:43,833 --> 00:13:46,250
So it stands to reason
the curse will be lifted

176
00:13:46,333 --> 00:13:48,708
if we find a new soul
to take your place.

177
00:13:48,791 --> 00:13:50,250
But I can't
do that!

178
00:13:50,333 --> 00:13:53,083
You know what will happen to
me if I give up this necklace!

179
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:55,416
If only it didn't transform
me into the Black Knight

180
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,166
and cause so
much death...

181
00:13:57,250 --> 00:14:00,000
But my lady, you
know as well as I do

182
00:14:00,083 --> 00:14:03,041
that there's
no other way.

183
00:14:19,833 --> 00:14:21,958
Now you must hurry
Lady Morgana.

184
00:14:22,041 --> 00:14:23,625
Go to the
forbidden altar

185
00:14:23,708 --> 00:14:26,500
at the bottom of the
Caldron of Annuve.

186
00:14:40,458 --> 00:14:43,458
That doesn't look
too inviting.

187
00:14:43,541 --> 00:14:46,625
Wait my friend... You seek
the Caldron of Annuve,

188
00:14:46,708 --> 00:14:47,875
do you not?

189
00:14:47,958 --> 00:14:49,916
Listen! I'm just looking
for a friend of mine.

190
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,916
I don't care about
your precious jewel.

191
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,833
I see. But I believe
your friend does

192
00:14:53,916 --> 00:14:55,333
so you should
know this.

193
00:14:55,416 --> 00:14:57,708
The Blue Flame has
a curse on it...

194
00:14:57,791 --> 00:15:00,625
There is a heavy price
to use its power.

195
00:15:00,708 --> 00:15:03,125
It will possess you; and
it will own your soul.

196
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:12,708
Fancy meeting
you here.

197
00:15:14,125 --> 00:15:15,416
David!

198
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,916
And you thought you'd
gotten rid of me back there.

199
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,833
I guess I should've tried a
little harder. Goodbye David.

200
00:15:21,916 --> 00:15:22,541
Irene?

201
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:27,250
No way!

202
00:15:27,333 --> 00:15:31,083
Where are we...? It's like
we're in another world.

203
00:15:31,166 --> 00:15:33,458
Castles don't
just disappear.

204
00:15:34,916 --> 00:15:36,375
The communicator's out.

205
00:15:36,458 --> 00:15:38,750
One thing's certain,
this isn't right.

206
00:15:38,833 --> 00:15:41,166
Who cares? I just wanna
find the Blue Flame

207
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:42,541
and get the hell
out of here.

208
00:15:50,458 --> 00:15:52,708
This thing's
rock solid.

209
00:15:52,791 --> 00:15:56,208
Great! David's locator signal
just dropped off of the grid.

210
00:15:56,291 --> 00:15:59,041
Maybe we should
contact the Captain.

211
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:00,500
I just tried to
open up a channel.

212
00:16:00,583 --> 00:16:01,541
There must
be something

213
00:16:01,625 --> 00:16:03,083
interfering with
our communicators.

214
00:16:17,625 --> 00:16:18,708
What's
that...?

215
00:16:18,791 --> 00:16:20,708
That's it! The Blue
Flame of Isperil...

216
00:16:20,791 --> 00:16:24,208
I think we must be witnessing
a scene from the past.

217
00:17:09,041 --> 00:17:10,958
Irene! Are
you crazy?!

218
00:17:11,041 --> 00:17:12,250
It's
beautiful.

219
00:17:14,208 --> 00:17:15,875
Get out of
the way!

220
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:19,166
David!

221
00:17:23,166 --> 00:17:25,583
What did we do?! Why are
you trying to kill us?!

222
00:17:25,666 --> 00:17:28,708
Why do you torment me?
Don't you understand?!

223
00:17:28,791 --> 00:17:30,458
I'm a slave
to the jewel!

224
00:17:30,541 --> 00:17:34,541
I can't hold this sword
back any longer! Go! Now!

225
00:17:34,625 --> 00:17:36,666
No way! I came here
to get that jewel

226
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:38,416
and I'm not
leaving without it!

227
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,250
I said go! Hurry!

228
00:17:57,083 --> 00:17:59,000
Don't do it! Don't
put the necklace on!

229
00:18:01,041 --> 00:18:02,958
Irene! What good
is eternal life

230
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:05,083
if it means you end
up living like that?

231
00:18:05,166 --> 00:18:06,666
Just leave
it and go!

232
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:10,541
The jewel's mine; and don't
you try to stop me, David!

233
00:18:10,625 --> 00:18:12,541
It's already got
you! I can tell!

234
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:13,916
No you're
wrong!

235
00:18:25,291 --> 00:18:32,750
Don't you- dare to go- to the
blue, blue Flame of Isperil!

236
00:18:36,291 --> 00:18:37,916
Thank you for
everything...

237
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,500
Somehow your love
for one another

238
00:18:39,583 --> 00:18:41,458
overcame the curse
of the Blue Flame.

239
00:18:42,791 --> 00:18:46,416
Goodbye... My thoughts
will be with you always.

240
00:19:06,583 --> 00:19:08,791
They just
disappeared...

241
00:19:08,875 --> 00:19:10,916
David, about the money
I took from you-

242
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,416
Ah forget it. Just
consider it a loan.

243
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:16,708
Goodness. I think you're
getting soft in your old age.

244
00:19:41,125 --> 00:19:43,875
[Bruce] Can anyone tell me
what that was all about?

245
00:19:43,958 --> 00:19:46,125
[David] It's a
long story...

246
00:19:46,208 --> 00:19:48,250
Oh, well. At least
you're still alive.

247
00:19:48,333 --> 00:19:49,541
Yeah...

248
00:19:49,625 --> 00:19:52,833
If Gusfantail Castle
wasn't real, what was it?

249
00:19:52,916 --> 00:19:55,208
I don't know for sure but
maybe it was the desires

250
00:19:55,291 --> 00:19:56,875
of two souls who
finally realized

251
00:19:56,958 --> 00:19:59,416
that this isn't what
they wanted after all.

252
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:02,750
[Bruce] Heh! Spoken like a
true pony-tailed hippy!

253
00:20:02,833 --> 00:20:06,791
The Blue Flame of Isperil
has been put to rest for now.

254
00:20:06,875 --> 00:20:09,125
But until man can
conquer his desires,

255
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:11,000
there will
always be greed.

256
00:20:11,083 --> 00:20:12,375
For that
reason someday,

257
00:20:12,458 --> 00:20:14,916
someone might try to
awaken the legend.

258
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,208
from its sleep.

259
00:20:16,291 --> 00:20:18,291
We were able to rescue
the sole survivor

260
00:20:18,375 --> 00:20:20,791
of the downed aircraft
without incident...

261
00:20:20,875 --> 00:20:22,833
That's your
official report?

262
00:20:22,916 --> 00:20:25,625
That's exactly how it
went down, Captain.

263
00:20:25,708 --> 00:20:28,125
I see. Now prepare
Big 1 for take-off!

264
00:20:28,208 --> 00:20:29,041
[All]
Yes sir!

265
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:50,083
Yuki. Have you seen
Irene anywhere?

266
00:20:51,791 --> 00:20:53,708
Irene's already
gone, David...

267
00:20:53,791 --> 00:20:55,000
She left
this for you.

268
00:20:59,208 --> 00:21:00,375
Sorry David... I just
didn't have enough courage

269
00:21:00,458 --> 00:21:02,833
to say good-bye,
face-to-face.

270
00:21:02,916 --> 00:21:06,041
But I promise, I'll
come to see you again.

271
00:21:06,125 --> 00:21:08,541
Know this: you mean
the world to me!

272
00:21:08,625 --> 00:21:10,041
Love,
Irene.

273
00:21:15,583 --> 00:21:18,291
[David] One
Thousand Ables...?

274
00:21:18,375 --> 00:21:23,250
Only nine hundred
ninety-nine thousand to go.

275
00:21:23,333 --> 00:21:26,083
I hope it's sooner than
seven years next time, Irene.

276
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:26,458
[Bruce] Manabu and many
others are nearly killed

277
00:23:26,541 --> 00:23:28,833
when an intruder infiltrates
SDF Headquarters

278
00:23:28,916 --> 00:23:30,541
and starts
reeking havoc.

279
00:23:30,625 --> 00:23:32,291
But as we try to
hunt the alien down

280
00:23:32,375 --> 00:23:34,541
some old demons
start hunting me!

281
00:23:34,625 --> 00:23:36,875
Am I really
Toxic Bruce...?

282
00:23:36,958 --> 00:23:39,375
See ya next time
on the Railways!
