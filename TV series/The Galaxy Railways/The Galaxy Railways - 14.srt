1
00:01:43,333 --> 00:01:45,541
In life's journey
there comes a time

2
00:01:45,625 --> 00:01:48,583
when we start carrying
our own weight;

3
00:01:48,666 --> 00:01:51,750
a time when we say
goodbye to the past

4
00:01:51,833 --> 00:01:55,250
and embrace the infinite
possibilities of the future.

5
00:01:56,375 --> 00:01:59,083
This is Heidel. The
transfer has been made.

6
00:01:59,166 --> 00:02:00,541
The payment's
in the account.

7
00:02:00,625 --> 00:02:03,500
It will be carried
out as scheduled.

8
00:02:16,041 --> 00:02:17,791
We start at
ten-hundred hours.

9
00:02:17,875 --> 00:02:19,708
That's when the
Dignity One-twenty-five

10
00:02:19,791 --> 00:02:23,750
departs for Farrader. Our
job is to protect a VIP.

11
00:02:23,833 --> 00:02:26,250
He's the head of the
Clarious Stellar Cluster.

12
00:02:26,333 --> 00:02:28,166
His name is
President Drake.

13
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,125
The President is on
his campaign tour.

14
00:02:32,208 --> 00:02:34,791
Normally, several platoons take
turns guarding each section

15
00:02:34,875 --> 00:02:37,916
of the train's route...
But this time's different.

16
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
We'll be guarding
him the whole way.

17
00:02:40,083 --> 00:02:40,833
Manabu!

18
00:02:40,916 --> 00:02:42,375
Yes, Sir!

19
00:02:42,458 --> 00:02:43,208
Louis!

20
00:02:43,291 --> 00:02:45,333
Sir!

21
00:02:45,416 --> 00:02:49,041
I'm assigning you two to this.
You're in charge. Understood?

22
00:02:49,125 --> 00:02:50,083
Yes, Sir!
Captain!

23
00:02:51,708 --> 00:02:53,208
Since Planet Farrader
is in the system

24
00:02:53,291 --> 00:02:55,416
that Vega Platoon
normally patrols,

25
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,000
they'll be taking
over the mission

26
00:02:57,083 --> 00:02:58,916
once you two
arrive there.

27
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,083
Captain Bulge.

28
00:03:00,166 --> 00:03:01,625
Yes, Louis?

29
00:03:01,708 --> 00:03:04,583
Please, Sir... Can I switch
with someone and let them go?

30
00:03:05,666 --> 00:03:07,375
What's wrong?
Are you sick?

31
00:03:07,458 --> 00:03:09,666
No, Sir...
I'm fine.

32
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:11,291
Well, I don't
blame you, Louis.

33
00:03:11,375 --> 00:03:14,166
Yeah, that's tough.
Taking orders from Manabu.

34
00:03:15,916 --> 00:03:17,875
I take back my
last request, Sir.

35
00:03:17,958 --> 00:03:20,041
I'll be on the platform
at ten-hundred hours;

36
00:03:20,125 --> 00:03:23,083
ready to guard the VIP
Train for Sirius Platoon!

37
00:03:29,333 --> 00:03:30,916
They're here,
Mr. President.

38
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,750
Very well.
Send them in.

39
00:03:33,833 --> 00:03:35,708
President Drake. My
name's Manabu Yuuki.

40
00:03:35,791 --> 00:03:39,375
We'll be guarding you,
Sir. Pleased to meet you.

41
00:03:39,458 --> 00:03:41,708
Louis Fort Drake;
reporting for duty.

42
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:46,791
Your safety on the
way to Farrader

43
00:03:46,875 --> 00:03:48,541
is our number one
concern, Sir.

44
00:03:48,625 --> 00:03:49,875
Please let us
know if we can...

45
00:03:49,958 --> 00:03:52,166
Louis! I've missed
you so much!

46
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:55,333
You look so grown up! Why
haven't you contacted us?

47
00:03:55,416 --> 00:03:58,541
That's enough. The girl's
on duty. Leave her alone.

48
00:03:58,625 --> 00:04:00,208
The girl? She is
your daughter!

49
00:04:00,291 --> 00:04:03,416
What is wrong
with you...?

50
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:05,166
Please, forgive me,
President Drake!

51
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:07,416
I appreciate your
professional attitude.

52
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:08,666
But I want
you to know

53
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:10,416
that I'm not expecting
anything from you two.

54
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,958
I don't need
your services.

55
00:04:14,041 --> 00:04:15,958
I can assure you that
I am well protected.

56
00:04:16,041 --> 00:04:17,500
I make it a
point to be.

57
00:04:17,583 --> 00:04:19,250
Besides, the real
exposure to danger

58
00:04:19,333 --> 00:04:21,750
comes after I
land on Farrader.

59
00:04:21,833 --> 00:04:25,250
Yes, but you never know,
Sir. Anything could...

60
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:28,666
As I said: I'm
well protected.

61
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:30,583
These Secret Cyber
Servicemen look after me

62
00:04:30,666 --> 00:04:32,958
twenty-four
hours a day.

63
00:04:33,041 --> 00:04:34,416
They never
grow tired

64
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,666
and since they're not human
they're not scared to die.

65
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:38,791
Besides, even if
something did happen

66
00:04:38,875 --> 00:04:40,416
I wouldn't bother
you two with it.

67
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:43,333
So consider this a vacation
and enjoy the trip.

68
00:04:50,416 --> 00:04:52,083
Well, that was a
warm reception.

69
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:56,083
Why didn't you tell me that
your Father is President Drake?

70
00:04:56,166 --> 00:04:57,333
Does it make
a difference?

71
00:04:57,416 --> 00:04:59,125
Well, I guess
not. No.

72
00:04:59,208 --> 00:05:00,541
Most people would
be proud to say

73
00:05:00,625 --> 00:05:03,000
that their father's
a President...

74
00:05:03,083 --> 00:05:04,833
But I was
ashamed.

75
00:05:04,916 --> 00:05:06,750
He's your Dad. Why
were you ashamed?

76
00:05:06,833 --> 00:05:08,625
Isn't it obvious?
You met him.

77
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:13,541
He's a rude, arrogant jerk. He
was always in my business...

78
00:05:13,625 --> 00:05:15,000
Not because
he cared.

79
00:05:15,083 --> 00:05:17,791
But because he was worried
about his reputation.

80
00:05:17,875 --> 00:05:19,500
It was all about
his career...

81
00:05:19,583 --> 00:05:21,750
He tried to choose
my friends for me.

82
00:05:21,833 --> 00:05:25,333
He even tried to tell
me who I should marry.

83
00:05:25,416 --> 00:05:27,541
I couldn't take it
anymore so I left.

84
00:05:27,625 --> 00:05:28,750
I chose the SDF

85
00:05:28,833 --> 00:05:31,041
because I didn't have
anywhere else to go.

86
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:38,500
Well, that's it. Now you
know where I'm coming from.

87
00:05:38,583 --> 00:05:39,291
Louis!

88
00:05:39,375 --> 00:05:40,541
Mom!

89
00:05:40,625 --> 00:05:42,958
Look how grown-up you
are! And so beautiful!

90
00:05:43,041 --> 00:05:44,416
Thanks, Mom.
You are too.

91
00:05:46,083 --> 00:05:48,750
Oh, Louis... I've
missed you so much!

92
00:05:48,833 --> 00:05:50,125
I'm so happy
to see you!

93
00:05:50,208 --> 00:05:53,708
Now, Dear. Why did
you choose the SDF...?

94
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:56,458
It's such a dangerous
job! You could get hurt!

95
00:05:56,541 --> 00:05:59,416
Mom! I'll be okay! I'm
tougher than you think!

96
00:06:08,125 --> 00:06:09,583
This is as posh
as it gets.

97
00:06:09,666 --> 00:06:12,708
The Dignity is the creme de
la creme of passenger trains.

98
00:06:12,791 --> 00:06:15,958
The engine is fully automated.
It's state of the art.

99
00:06:16,041 --> 00:06:18,291
It lives up to its
reputation, that's for sure.

100
00:06:18,375 --> 00:06:21,833
All I do is watch the VIP's
have caviar and Champagne.

101
00:06:21,916 --> 00:06:24,583
Sometimes I do more than
watch if you know what I mean.

102
00:06:26,125 --> 00:06:28,375
Ehhh... That's
not good.

103
00:06:28,458 --> 00:06:30,541
...But the auto-pilot
gets none!

104
00:06:33,666 --> 00:06:35,416
Please don't take it
personally, sweetheart.

105
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,208
You know how
your Father is.

106
00:06:37,291 --> 00:06:38,416
He was happy
to see you.

107
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,500
He just doesn't know
how to show it.

108
00:06:40,583 --> 00:06:41,833
Yeah right...

109
00:06:41,916 --> 00:06:43,791
He'd treat a stranger
better than he treated me.

110
00:06:43,875 --> 00:06:48,750
You saw him. He acted like
he didn't even know me.

111
00:06:48,833 --> 00:06:50,875
He didn't
mean it.

112
00:06:50,958 --> 00:06:52,833
You're Father's under a
great deal of pressure.

113
00:06:52,916 --> 00:06:54,875
He has to give
a big speech.

114
00:06:54,958 --> 00:06:56,750
Yeah! That somebody
else wrote for him;

115
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:59,125
that he reads from the podium
like a trained monkey!

116
00:06:59,208 --> 00:07:01,541
I know the
game, Mother...

117
00:07:01,625 --> 00:07:03,583
I lived with it for
all those years.

118
00:07:03,666 --> 00:07:06,125
It's all about appearances
and public opinion.

119
00:07:06,208 --> 00:07:07,083
None of
it's real.

120
00:07:07,166 --> 00:07:08,416
Louis...

121
00:07:22,166 --> 00:07:23,125
Louis.

122
00:07:41,375 --> 00:07:43,291
Come in.
It's open.

123
00:07:43,375 --> 00:07:46,166
Good evening, Sir. Your
speech for Farrader is ready.

124
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:50,208
I've already proofed it.
We just need your approval.

125
00:07:50,291 --> 00:07:51,791
Sending more
troops to Ludail

126
00:07:51,875 --> 00:07:54,125
is going to cause a great
deal of controversy.

127
00:07:54,208 --> 00:07:54,958
Mm.

128
00:08:06,041 --> 00:08:07,875
I was told that the
young lady who boarded

129
00:08:07,958 --> 00:08:11,500
with the SDF is
your daughter, Sir?

130
00:08:11,583 --> 00:08:13,000
Yes, that's
correct.

131
00:08:13,083 --> 00:08:14,416
What a nice
surprise!

132
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,666
Would you like to have dinner
with her, Mr. President?

133
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:18,000
With my
daughter?

134
00:08:18,083 --> 00:08:20,750
Yes! I could extend the
invitation on your behalf.

135
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:23,875
I'd sooner have dinner with a
terrorist leader than with her.

136
00:08:25,875 --> 00:08:29,166
Please, Louis. Try talking
to him one more time... Hmm?

137
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:30,500
Where did you
run off to?

138
00:08:30,583 --> 00:08:32,208
I was up front talking
to the conductor.

139
00:08:32,291 --> 00:08:34,291
Why? Did you miss
me or something?

140
00:08:34,375 --> 00:08:36,250
Yeah, right.
Not hardly.

141
00:08:36,333 --> 00:08:37,500
We haven't been
introduced.

142
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:39,000
I'm Louis' Mom.

143
00:08:39,083 --> 00:08:40,833
Hi. I'm
Manabu Yuuki.

144
00:08:40,916 --> 00:08:43,541
So are you and Louis more
than just co-workers?

145
00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:47,000
Forgive me. I was
just wondering

146
00:08:47,083 --> 00:08:49,375
if you two are
going out or not.

147
00:08:49,458 --> 00:08:50,750
No, Ma'am.

148
00:08:50,833 --> 00:08:51,791
She didn't
mean it!

149
00:08:51,875 --> 00:08:53,916
Mother! Are you
out of your mind?

150
00:08:55,541 --> 00:08:56,500
The President!!
Come on!!

151
00:08:58,875 --> 00:08:59,916
Go, Krista! Run!

152
00:09:07,791 --> 00:09:10,500
Oh, no, no! Why are
they doing this?

153
00:09:12,291 --> 00:09:13,458
Mr. President.

154
00:09:16,291 --> 00:09:17,083
Krista!!

155
00:09:23,291 --> 00:09:24,083
Are you
all right?!

156
00:09:24,166 --> 00:09:24,625
Yes!

157
00:09:24,708 --> 00:09:26,083
Mr. President!!

158
00:09:35,458 --> 00:09:37,750
Louis! Harold! What in
the world happened?!

159
00:09:37,833 --> 00:09:39,833
Were you hit?!
Are you okay?!

160
00:09:39,916 --> 00:09:40,750
I'm fine.

161
00:09:40,833 --> 00:09:41,791
I thought
you were...

162
00:09:41,875 --> 00:09:43,583
It's over, Dear.

163
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:45,250
What happened?!

164
00:09:45,333 --> 00:09:47,916
The Cyber Servicemen tried
to murder President Drake!

165
00:09:49,208 --> 00:09:50,666
He's
moving!

166
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:52,583
How many hits
can they take?

167
00:09:53,541 --> 00:09:55,583
Louis! Take them
to the front car!

168
00:09:55,666 --> 00:09:57,250
Right!
Got it!

169
00:09:57,333 --> 00:09:58,958
What the!!

170
00:09:59,041 --> 00:09:59,875
Come with us!

171
00:10:01,166 --> 00:10:02,166
Manabu!

172
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:07,541
Go!! Close the
door and lock it!!

173
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:10,833
Louis! What
about Manabu?!

174
00:10:10,916 --> 00:10:12,708
His mission is to
protect the President!

175
00:10:43,416 --> 00:10:45,791
Come on!
Almost there!

176
00:10:45,875 --> 00:10:48,166
What's he doing?! How's
he going to get back?!

177
00:11:09,916 --> 00:11:10,208
There!

178
00:11:24,583 --> 00:11:25,958
They're going
to love this!

179
00:11:29,583 --> 00:11:30,458
Mmm!

180
00:11:33,416 --> 00:11:34,500
Dignity!
Come in!

181
00:11:34,583 --> 00:11:36,708
This is Manabu Yuuki
in the rear coach!

182
00:11:36,791 --> 00:11:39,916
Please lower the Orbit
Shield for ten seconds!

183
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,541
Are you insane?! We'll
all be unprotected!

184
00:11:42,625 --> 00:11:43,958
Just ten
seconds!

185
00:11:44,041 --> 00:11:53,666
All right, then...
ten seconds.

186
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:55,375
Turn it back
on! Now!

187
00:11:55,458 --> 00:11:59,916
Right! Got it!

188
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,708
Manabu did it!
It's over!

189
00:12:01,791 --> 00:12:03,416
Thank
heavens!

190
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:06,625
He's so crazy... 
How does he do it?

191
00:12:06,708 --> 00:12:09,458
Dignity! Please cut
your speed by 20%!

192
00:12:09,541 --> 00:12:11,375
Decelerate
and reconnect!

193
00:12:11,458 --> 00:12:20,750
Right! Got it!... 
Reducing speed by 20%.

194
00:12:23,333 --> 00:12:29,125
Manabu... Manabu!!

195
00:12:31,875 --> 00:12:32,625
Louis!

196
00:12:32,708 --> 00:12:35,541
No!

197
00:12:35,625 --> 00:12:40,125
We still have a little gap.
Cut your speed by another 5%.

198
00:12:41,541 --> 00:12:42,791
Louis!

199
00:12:45,875 --> 00:12:47,041
She did it!

200
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:01,958
Mr. President, your wife
took a mild sedative.

201
00:13:02,041 --> 00:13:03,583
She's resting
comfortably now.

202
00:13:03,666 --> 00:13:05,625
Very good. Thank
you, Krista.

203
00:13:05,708 --> 00:13:09,125
Also, Sir. That was the only
copy of your speech that I had.

204
00:13:09,208 --> 00:13:11,250
Maybe we can have
one sent to Farrader.

205
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:13,166
I should have made
another copy.

206
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:15,125
No. It wouldn't have
made a difference.

207
00:13:16,208 --> 00:13:18,000
I wouldn't have
used it anyway.

208
00:13:19,416 --> 00:13:23,125
I already have a speech;
right up here in my head.

209
00:13:23,208 --> 00:13:24,625
Dad?

210
00:13:24,708 --> 00:13:25,958
Are you
sure, Sir?

211
00:13:26,041 --> 00:13:28,708
I'm positive. It will
be a refreshing change.

212
00:13:28,791 --> 00:13:30,333
Yes, Mr.
President.

213
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:36,666
Hmm?

214
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:39,666
No sugar; just the
way you like it.

215
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:40,750
Thank you, Louis.

216
00:13:50,541 --> 00:13:52,166
This is Manabu
on the Dignity.

217
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:55,291
What's going on? You skipped
your regular report.

218
00:13:55,375 --> 00:13:56,291
I thought that
Headquarters

219
00:13:56,375 --> 00:13:58,833
would have filled
you in by now.

220
00:13:58,916 --> 00:14:00,666
We haven't heard
from Headquarters.

221
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:02,250
What? You've got
to be kidding.

222
00:14:02,333 --> 00:14:06,000
Surely the Conductor has
made a report by now.

223
00:14:06,083 --> 00:14:08,916
What happened? Is the
President okay, Manabu?

224
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,375
Yes, Sir. But a little
while ago his guards...

225
00:14:13,208 --> 00:14:15,875
Manabu! Are you there?!
What's going on?!

226
00:14:15,958 --> 00:14:17,250
You! You're
the one!

227
00:14:18,541 --> 00:14:21,791
Manabu! What's happening!
Please! Come in!

228
00:14:21,875 --> 00:14:26,833
Now! ...I've got
to do this fast!

229
00:14:26,916 --> 00:14:27,833
System Check!

230
00:14:27,916 --> 00:14:29,833
Stand by for
System Check!

231
00:14:29,916 --> 00:14:31,833
Orbit Network
Radar ready!

232
00:14:31,916 --> 00:14:35,166
Magnetic Barrier
Generator is a go!

233
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:39,500
Big One is now in
take-off position!

234
00:14:39,583 --> 00:14:41,500
Cylinder Valves
are open!

235
00:14:41,583 --> 00:14:43,166
Atomic Boiler
Pressure is a go!

236
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:44,791
The Main Circuit
is online!

237
00:14:44,875 --> 00:14:48,125
All energy levels
ready for take-off!

238
00:14:48,208 --> 00:14:51,125
The warp-drive coupling
is now in place!

239
00:14:51,208 --> 00:14:54,958
All Systems green, Captain!
Awaiting your command!

240
00:14:55,041 --> 00:14:56,583
Let's move out!
Ahead full!

241
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:19,375
I thank you for
helping me, Louis.

242
00:15:19,458 --> 00:15:23,000
You and your colleague
did a commendable job...

243
00:15:23,083 --> 00:15:25,625
What your friend did
earlier was very brave.

244
00:15:27,875 --> 00:15:31,041
Look, I can understand why
you chose to leave home.

245
00:15:31,125 --> 00:15:32,750
But you could have gone to
the school of your choice.

246
00:15:32,833 --> 00:15:35,041
Why the SDF?

247
00:15:35,125 --> 00:15:37,333
I know. I was far
from the ideal Father

248
00:15:37,416 --> 00:15:40,208
but I always had your
best interests in mind.

249
00:15:40,291 --> 00:15:43,708
And I hope you didn't choose
this career just to spite me.

250
00:15:43,791 --> 00:15:47,500
If you did, you'll never find
fulfillment in life; ever.

251
00:15:47,583 --> 00:15:48,625
That's not
why! Hmm?

252
00:15:48,708 --> 00:15:49,500
Hmm?

253
00:15:49,583 --> 00:15:51,000
Pardon the
interruption.

254
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:53,458
Your partner said that he
needs you up front right away.

255
00:15:53,541 --> 00:15:56,125
What now? We've had enough
trouble for one trip.

256
00:15:56,208 --> 00:15:58,291
I'll be right
back, Sir.

257
00:15:58,375 --> 00:16:01,458
Thanks, Conductor. Please guard
the President while I'm gone.

258
00:16:01,541 --> 00:16:02,958
I will.

259
00:16:03,041 --> 00:16:04,750
Is there some
sort of problem?

260
00:16:04,833 --> 00:16:07,750
If there is, I don't think
it's anything serious, Sir.

261
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:08,833
Let's hope not.

262
00:16:12,125 --> 00:16:14,125
Manabu wouldn't
leave Dad unguarded!

263
00:16:14,208 --> 00:16:19,541
Uh! What was it about him?
Something wasn't right!

264
00:16:19,625 --> 00:16:20,333
No, father!

265
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:26,500
Dad!! Look out!!

266
00:16:26,583 --> 00:16:26,833
Hmm?!!

267
00:16:26,916 --> 00:16:28,500
No!!

268
00:16:29,583 --> 00:16:30,541
It's over, Drake!!

269
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:33,333
Die!!!!!!!

270
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:37,166
You've
been hit!!

271
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:39,708
Louis, watch
his gun!

272
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:41,500
Get off!!

273
00:16:45,291 --> 00:16:48,375
Killed by your
daughter's gun!

274
00:16:48,458 --> 00:16:51,166
Don't you love life's
little, unexpected ironies?

275
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:58,083
Don't be an idiot!
Move aside!

276
00:16:58,166 --> 00:17:00,000
He's going to die
no matter what!

277
00:17:00,083 --> 00:17:01,875
See that battleship
out there?!

278
00:17:01,958 --> 00:17:03,625
If I don't tell them
that your Father's dead

279
00:17:03,708 --> 00:17:06,291
in one minute they'll
blow this whole train up!

280
00:17:06,375 --> 00:17:09,333
...Now step aside or
we'll all die together!

281
00:17:09,416 --> 00:17:12,000
Do what you have to
do... I'm not moving.

282
00:17:12,083 --> 00:17:13,708
I hate killing
pretty young women

283
00:17:13,791 --> 00:17:15,125
but you leave
me no choice.

284
00:17:18,041 --> 00:17:20,000
Drop the gun! There's
no way out of this!

285
00:17:20,083 --> 00:17:22,625
Shut your mouth!

286
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:25,416
Your term as president
is over, Drake!

287
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:26,041
Dad! Run!

288
00:17:26,125 --> 00:17:30,125
Louis!

289
00:17:30,208 --> 00:17:32,250
Too late! ...They
can't stop me now!

290
00:17:32,333 --> 00:17:34,708
You haven't killed anyone
yet! Why commit murder?!

291
00:17:34,791 --> 00:17:35,500
Turn yourself in!
Don't do this!

292
00:17:37,708 --> 00:17:41,041
Dignity, come in! This is
Captain Murase of Vega Platoon!

293
00:17:41,125 --> 00:17:41,583
Is the President all right?!
Please respond! Dignity?!

294
00:17:41,666 --> 00:17:45,250
The President!!

295
00:17:45,333 --> 00:17:48,000
No reply. Bulge will
have to handle it...

296
00:17:48,083 --> 00:17:52,291
Stay with
that battleship!

297
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:05,666
The Dignity
seems fine,

298
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:06,791
but with the Orbit
Shields down

299
00:18:06,875 --> 00:18:09,625
I can't tell what's
going on inside.

300
00:18:09,708 --> 00:18:12,125
Right. Pull up parallel.
Prepare to board.

301
00:18:16,291 --> 00:18:18,166
You can get off easy
if you give up!

302
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:20,000
You liar!!

303
00:18:20,083 --> 00:18:20,291
Louis!!
Look out!!

304
00:18:21,583 --> 00:18:23,125
Stay still!

305
00:18:27,041 --> 00:18:29,583
That's enough of
that... It's over.

306
00:18:32,916 --> 00:18:34,625
You have the right
to run like hell.

307
00:18:34,708 --> 00:18:36,166
Or you can give
up and stay alive.

308
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:38,166
Hey, Captain...

309
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:40,125
Mister President,
are you okay?

310
00:18:40,208 --> 00:18:42,291
I think so.

311
00:18:42,375 --> 00:18:43,458
Is the
wound deep?

312
00:18:43,541 --> 00:18:45,000
It's nothing major.

313
00:18:45,083 --> 00:18:47,833
You need treatment,
Mr. President!

314
00:18:47,916 --> 00:18:51,500
I have everything I
need... right here.

315
00:18:53,125 --> 00:18:57,291
My dear Louis; I am
so proud of you...

316
00:18:57,375 --> 00:19:00,333
You have no
idea how much.

317
00:19:20,833 --> 00:19:24,958
Friends of Ferrader- today we
find ourselves at a crossroads.

318
00:19:25,041 --> 00:19:26,791
Before us we have two
different directions

319
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:28,625
that we can take
into the future.

320
00:19:28,708 --> 00:19:31,333
We can continue along the
same path that we are on...

321
00:19:31,416 --> 00:19:34,291
Or we can forge a
new path altogether.

322
00:19:34,375 --> 00:19:36,791
I propose the latter; a
new direction in which

323
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:40,708
our policies are based solely
on the welfare of our children.

324
00:19:40,791 --> 00:19:42,166
Did you know
about this??

325
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:43,208
No!

326
00:19:43,291 --> 00:19:44,458
Too often we ignore
what is right

327
00:19:44,541 --> 00:19:47,583
and base our decisions
on economic idealogy.

328
00:19:47,666 --> 00:19:50,083
We say: Let's go for
the healthy economy now

329
00:19:50,166 --> 00:19:52,333
and fix our problems
in the future.

330
00:19:52,416 --> 00:19:54,583
But what if there is
no future, friends?

331
00:19:54,666 --> 00:19:57,500
What if this day
is our last...?

332
00:19:57,583 --> 00:19:58,833
If it were not
for the bravery

333
00:19:58,916 --> 00:20:00,791
of two members of our
younger generation,

334
00:20:00,875 --> 00:20:02,750
today would have
been my last.

335
00:20:02,833 --> 00:20:05,541
They protected my life with
a brand of courage and honor

336
00:20:05,625 --> 00:20:08,041
that I have never seen
in the political arena.

337
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:12,166
This is what we must
base our future on.

338
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:15,375
Not on healthy economies;
and not on wars.

339
00:20:15,458 --> 00:20:18,250
But on the kind of honor
they showed me today.

340
00:20:18,333 --> 00:20:22,416
If we have this, we can
overcome any problem.

341
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:23,375
Go, Dad.

342
00:20:37,458 --> 00:20:39,000
Like Father,
like Daughter!

343
00:20:39,083 --> 00:20:40,250
What do
you mean?

344
00:20:40,333 --> 00:20:41,500
Your Dad
just announced

345
00:20:41,583 --> 00:20:43,416
that he's withdrawing
all troops from Ludaile.

346
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:46,583
He's cutting back on
military across the board.

347
00:20:46,666 --> 00:20:49,125
He's working for peace
just like you, Louis.

348
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:53,791
You just saved more
lives than I ever will

349
00:20:53,875 --> 00:20:56,333
and you did it by
yourself. No guns.

350
00:20:56,416 --> 00:21:00,583
No bullets; you just
changed a man's heart.

351
00:21:00,666 --> 00:21:02,166
Wow- thanks, Manabu.

352
00:21:06,666 --> 00:21:11,125
After being hurt in life
some of us build defenses;

353
00:21:11,208 --> 00:21:14,500
we become hardened and out
of fear of getting hurt again,

354
00:21:14,583 --> 00:21:16,916
we don't permit
ourselves to feel.

355
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,875
Often times this
goes unchecked

356
00:21:18,958 --> 00:21:21,500
and we remain
bitter to the end.

357
00:21:21,583 --> 00:21:25,750
But, in some cases, life
brings to us to a special event

358
00:21:25,833 --> 00:21:27,375
that tears down
our defenses

359
00:21:27,458 --> 00:21:31,000
and fills our hearts
with hope once again.

360
00:23:24,333 --> 00:23:25,708
As the Vandern
Meteor Stream

361
00:23:25,791 --> 00:23:27,916
forges a deadly path
through our Galaxy,

362
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,333
Spica, Vega, and Sirious
Platoons are dispatched

363
00:23:30,416 --> 00:23:32,500
to change its course
or destroy it.

364
00:23:32,583 --> 00:23:34,541
Little do we know that a
much more dangerous threat

365
00:23:34,625 --> 00:23:36,333
is lurking
right behind it!

366
00:23:36,416 --> 00:23:38,791
See ya next time
on the Railways!
