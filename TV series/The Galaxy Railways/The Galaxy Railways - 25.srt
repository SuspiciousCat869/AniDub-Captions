1
00:01:41,083 --> 00:01:43,458
The absurdly powerful
Alfort Fleet is on its way

2
00:01:43,541 --> 00:01:45,500
to destroy
Planet Destiny.

3
00:01:45,583 --> 00:01:47,666
The lives of millions
of innocent men, women,

4
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:50,166
and children are
hanging in the balance.

5
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:51,625
Answering
their call,

6
00:01:51,708 --> 00:01:55,208
Big One is taking off to
join the last line of defense.

7
00:01:55,291 --> 00:01:57,916
Let's move out!
Ahead full!

8
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,500
Their success means life...
their failure... death.

9
00:02:23,416 --> 00:02:25,500
Hey, Dad! I just
saw one train

10
00:02:25,583 --> 00:02:27,500
heading in the
opposite direction...

11
00:02:27,583 --> 00:02:28,875
Where are
they going?

12
00:02:28,958 --> 00:02:32,125
That's a combat train, son.
They're part of the SDF.

13
00:02:32,208 --> 00:02:35,333
That train belongs to the Space
Defense Force?! Really, Dad?!

14
00:02:35,416 --> 00:02:36,083
Uh, huh.

15
00:02:36,166 --> 00:02:38,166
Awesome!!

16
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:42,125
That was no ordinary SDF
train... That was Big One.

17
00:02:44,833 --> 00:02:48,250
The hope of the
Galaxy Railways.

18
00:02:48,333 --> 00:02:50,958
[Child] Big One! Wow!

19
00:03:01,541 --> 00:03:04,208
Godspeed, Bulge!

20
00:03:04,291 --> 00:03:06,458
Our Destiny is being
stolen from us.

21
00:03:06,541 --> 00:03:09,416
It's disappearing
before my inner eye...

22
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:12,333
Don't let them take it.
You're the only ones

23
00:03:12,416 --> 00:03:18,000
who can stop them. You must find
a way... I'm counting on you.

24
00:03:31,791 --> 00:03:37,333
Damn! What a
pain! Whitman!

25
00:03:39,583 --> 00:03:42,791
The Defense Fortress Annex is a
fully automated Armed Station.

26
00:03:42,875 --> 00:03:45,625
It's usually used as a Reserve
Switchyard but it was deployed

27
00:03:45,708 --> 00:03:48,541
by Headquarters to strengthen
Planet Destiny's defenses

28
00:03:48,625 --> 00:03:50,375
in the event
of an attack.

29
00:03:50,458 --> 00:03:51,625
When the Alfort
Fleet arrives,

30
00:03:51,708 --> 00:03:53,666
Annex will begin
its automated assault.

31
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:54,958
This should keep
their Armada busy

32
00:03:55,041 --> 00:03:57,458
while we finish modifying
our Main Battery.

33
00:03:57,541 --> 00:03:58,833
Then we'll make
a small warp-jump

34
00:03:58,916 --> 00:04:01,125
to a point right
above their fleet.

35
00:04:01,208 --> 00:04:02,666
From there we'll
launch our offensive

36
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:05,375
as we move down through them
to get to their command ship.

37
00:04:05,458 --> 00:04:08,125
That's our main target;
it's their biggest Destroyer.

38
00:04:08,208 --> 00:04:09,958
But, Sir, how can we
hope to disable it?

39
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:11,791
This could
get ugly fast.

40
00:04:11,875 --> 00:04:13,833
Our goal is to
destroy that ship...

41
00:04:13,916 --> 00:04:15,625
If we can paralyze
their command system

42
00:04:15,708 --> 00:04:17,375
we may have a chance
to beat them.

43
00:04:17,458 --> 00:04:18,666
If they get by
us, it's over,

44
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:21,666
so be prepared to do
whatever it takes!

45
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:24,166
All right! Let's do
it, Sirius Platoon!

46
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:25,916
Yes, Sir!!

47
00:04:32,083 --> 00:04:33,916
Where am I?

48
00:04:47,833 --> 00:04:48,875
[Louis] Manabu!!

49
00:04:56,208 --> 00:04:58,500
No! Louis!!

50
00:05:02,625 --> 00:05:04,625
I still feel
your warmth.

51
00:05:07,541 --> 00:05:09,666
I promise: I won't
let you down.

52
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:12,166
With this life you
saved I'll save Destiny.

53
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:15,541
Or I'll
die trying.

54
00:05:15,625 --> 00:05:18,125
What? What
is it?!

55
00:05:18,208 --> 00:05:19,583
Not a thing.

56
00:05:19,666 --> 00:05:21,791
But I am putting you in
charge of our weapons systems.

57
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:25,583
You're Bruce's successor.
Make him proud.

58
00:05:25,666 --> 00:05:26,458
Right!

59
00:05:29,541 --> 00:05:33,291
Manabu! Just
do your best!

60
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:34,458
I will.

61
00:05:40,166 --> 00:05:41,875
Our troops found you while
they were out inspecting

62
00:05:41,958 --> 00:05:44,166
the wreckage on the battlefield
and they brought you in

63
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:46,916
as a specimen for
testing and research.

64
00:05:47,958 --> 00:05:49,541
I kept you here
temporarily

65
00:05:49,625 --> 00:05:51,291
because there's something
I want to ask you.

66
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,916
What happened to the one who
was wearing this pendant?!

67
00:06:07,083 --> 00:06:10,416
Liffle is dead. Your
people attacked...

68
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,541
She died
helping us.

69
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:18,500
[Sayaka] The Alfort Fleet will
reach Annex in thirty minutes!

70
00:06:21,291 --> 00:06:23,625
[Kate] Annex is activating
its defense systems!

71
00:06:28,916 --> 00:06:31,791
[Kate] Annex Remote Control
Systems are on-line, Commander!

72
00:06:32,416 --> 00:06:35,166
[Commander] Where's Big One?
How are they making out?

73
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:37,250
[Miki] They're 15 thousand
mega-meters from Destiny.

74
00:06:37,333 --> 00:06:42,458
The modifications to their
Main Battery are 75% complete.

75
00:06:42,541 --> 00:06:44,958
Damn it. We're
running out of time.

76
00:06:47,625 --> 00:06:48,666
The damage to the
engine is worse

77
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:50,000
than we expected,
Commander.

78
00:06:50,083 --> 00:06:51,875
All the pressure
valves are fried.

79
00:06:51,958 --> 00:06:54,000
The sub-atomic guns
aren't working either.

80
00:06:54,083 --> 00:06:55,708
She's pretty
banged up.

81
00:06:55,791 --> 00:06:57,875
[Commander] Just do the
best that you can.

82
00:06:57,958 --> 00:07:01,791
We just need to get to Annex.
Iron Berger can handle that...

83
00:07:01,875 --> 00:07:04,166
She may be wounded
but she's not dead.

84
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:06,000
If the sub-atomic
guns are shot

85
00:07:06,083 --> 00:07:07,916
you might as well
connect the Gustav.

86
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,208
Yeah. Right on.

87
00:07:09,291 --> 00:07:11,791
But that's too dangerous!
Are you guys crazy?

88
00:07:11,875 --> 00:07:14,666
Look. If it fries the system,
Big One will tow us back.

89
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:16,000
But, Sir! I...

90
00:07:16,083 --> 00:07:18,333
And if we get injured
we'll get to be with Yuki!

91
00:07:18,416 --> 00:07:23,625
All right. Let's go have a
quick drink! I'm thirsty!

92
00:07:23,708 --> 00:07:24,666
Yes, Sir!

93
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:25,666
Yeah! Ha, ha, ha!

94
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:26,958
Wait! That's against
regulations!

95
00:07:33,625 --> 00:07:37,000
The Alfort Fleet is now in
striking range of Annex, Sir!

96
00:07:37,083 --> 00:07:38,833
Don't launch the
attack yet...

97
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:41,041
Let's try to bring
them in a bit closer...

98
00:07:41,125 --> 00:07:42,666
The longer we
wait the better.

99
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:44,541
Big One needs
more time.

100
00:07:44,625 --> 00:07:48,041
Commander! The entire Alfort
Armada is slowing down!

101
00:07:48,125 --> 00:07:49,000
What?!

102
00:07:57,458 --> 00:07:59,250
Captain! The Alfort
Fleet has come to a stop!

103
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,458
What are
they doing?!

104
00:08:06,333 --> 00:08:10,208
Liffle ... Why
am I not surprised?

105
00:08:10,291 --> 00:08:13,083
My sister Liffle was
truly a great scientist.

106
00:08:13,166 --> 00:08:15,625
But she was
idealistic to a fault.

107
00:08:15,708 --> 00:08:17,666
So you're
absolutely certain?

108
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:20,000
She gave the Cosmo
Matrix to your people?

109
00:08:24,458 --> 00:08:25,875
Take this.

110
00:08:25,958 --> 00:08:27,583
I've decided
to let you go.

111
00:08:27,666 --> 00:08:28,583
What?!

112
00:08:28,666 --> 00:08:30,916
Leave! Go back to
where Manabu is.

113
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,041
H-how do you know?

114
00:08:33,125 --> 00:08:36,000
You kept calling his name
when you were delirious.

115
00:08:36,083 --> 00:08:38,083
He must be very
special to you.

116
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:42,333
Thank you.

117
00:08:43,916 --> 00:08:45,333
A message is
coming in.

118
00:08:45,416 --> 00:08:47,541
It's from the Alfort
Fleet, Commander.

119
00:08:47,625 --> 00:08:49,333
It says Destiny...

120
00:08:49,416 --> 00:08:52,166
surrender immediately or
you will be destroyed.

121
00:08:54,291 --> 00:08:56,750
Let's use this to buy
a little more time.

122
00:08:56,833 --> 00:08:58,291
Tell them that we're
considering it

123
00:08:58,375 --> 00:08:59,958
and we'll get
back to them shortly.

124
00:09:00,041 --> 00:09:01,208
Yes, Sir!

125
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:05,000
Come on, Schwanheld! Get
that Main Battery ready!

126
00:09:09,875 --> 00:09:12,333
Is this just the calm
before the storm?

127
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:20,583
Don't move.

128
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:23,416
Send Annex right
up their throats

129
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:24,958
and aim at their
command ship!

130
00:09:25,041 --> 00:09:26,041
That is an order!

131
00:09:26,125 --> 00:09:28,666
Sir! I can't! I...

132
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:32,416
We're going to put an end
to this once and for all.

133
00:09:44,416 --> 00:09:46,208
Don't worry.
It's self-adjusting.

134
00:09:52,583 --> 00:09:57,000
Take that one there. It has
a telepathy-operation system.

135
00:09:57,083 --> 00:10:00,208
My name is Trille... Thank you
for being at my sister's side

136
00:10:00,291 --> 00:10:01,500
when she
passed away.

137
00:10:01,583 --> 00:10:03,833
I'm Louis.
Of course.

138
00:10:03,916 --> 00:10:07,166
I'll remember you, Louis.
Now please... Hurry.

139
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:11,166
I don't get it... Why are
your people doing this?!

140
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:14,375
Why have they started
this terrible war?!

141
00:10:14,458 --> 00:10:17,416
This is exactly what
Liffle was trying to avoid!

142
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:19,125
That's why she
risked her life

143
00:10:19,208 --> 00:10:21,458
to deliver the Cosmo-Matrix
to us, Trille!

144
00:10:21,541 --> 00:10:26,541
I know that! But it's too late!
We can't turn back anymore!

145
00:10:26,625 --> 00:10:30,041
Our children
must live.

146
00:10:30,125 --> 00:10:34,000
We can co-exist peacefully!
Please! It's not too late!

147
00:10:34,083 --> 00:10:36,500
Can't you ask your superiors
to call off the attack?!

148
00:10:36,583 --> 00:10:38,875
Millions of lives
are at stake!

149
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:41,958
Hurry! Go!

150
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:44,916
Trille!

151
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,250
Where is
the prisoner?

152
00:10:46,333 --> 00:10:48,083
We thought she
was with you.

153
00:10:48,166 --> 00:10:50,083
Come. We
must find her.

154
00:10:51,041 --> 00:10:52,416
Ivanov!! Are
you insane?!

155
00:10:59,666 --> 00:11:04,958
I'm gonna blast you damn
weeds right out of the sky!

156
00:11:16,291 --> 00:11:18,833
Take him away.
He's finished here.

157
00:11:29,666 --> 00:11:32,458
Captain! Annex is advancing
and attacking the fleet!

158
00:11:32,541 --> 00:11:36,208
That's not the plan! What
in the hell's going on?!

159
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:49,041
Open fire.

160
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,083
They have the Cosmo
Matrix? Are you certain?

161
00:12:23,166 --> 00:12:26,500
Yes. My sister
took it to them.

162
00:12:26,583 --> 00:12:29,000
I did hear that an
SDF combat train

163
00:12:29,083 --> 00:12:31,083
shot down one of
our scout ships.

164
00:12:31,166 --> 00:12:34,416
But that was an isolated
incident. None of their trains

165
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,458
have exhibited that
kind of firepower

166
00:12:36,541 --> 00:12:38,416
since we began
our offensive.

167
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:40,666
Perhaps not
yet, General.

168
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:42,333
But if they analyze
the matrix...

169
00:12:42,416 --> 00:12:44,791
We have already
penetrated to the core

170
00:12:44,875 --> 00:12:47,166
of the Galaxy
Railways' defenses.

171
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:49,875
I do not anticipate any
resistance stronger

172
00:12:49,958 --> 00:12:52,666
than what we have
already encountered.

173
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:54,666
If the Cosmo Matrix
was operational

174
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:56,625
they would have
used it by now.

175
00:12:56,708 --> 00:13:00,958
We will do our Master's bidding
and continue our attack!

176
00:13:01,041 --> 00:13:02,750
[Manabu] Annex has
been destroyed.

177
00:13:02,833 --> 00:13:04,500
[David] What the hell is
headquarters doing?!

178
00:13:04,583 --> 00:13:06,458
Are they out
of their minds?!

179
00:13:06,541 --> 00:13:08,541
Sorry, Bulge... Damn.

180
00:13:08,625 --> 00:13:10,083
Commander.

181
00:13:10,166 --> 00:13:11,750
It must have
been Ivanov!

182
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:13,666
And What about
the Alfort Fleet?

183
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:18,375
Zero damage, Captain! They've
started advancing again!

184
00:13:18,458 --> 00:13:21,166
They're 8,000
mega-meters from Destiny!

185
00:13:26,333 --> 00:13:29,708
I love you, Julia.
Please don't die.

186
00:13:33,875 --> 00:13:35,416
Oh, and
by the way.

187
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:38,541
I'd like an answer to that
question I asked you...

188
00:13:38,625 --> 00:13:40,541
You can let me know
when I get back.

189
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:56,916
The main engine's running at
70% of its maximum power.

190
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,833
That's all we
could muster.

191
00:13:58,916 --> 00:14:00,750
And she'll seem even
more sluggish with the

192
00:14:00,833 --> 00:14:01,750
Gustav hooked
up to her.

193
00:14:01,833 --> 00:14:03,125
Right. Got it.

194
00:14:05,583 --> 00:14:08,083
That was
Excellent work!

195
00:14:08,166 --> 00:14:09,208
Good luck, Sir!

196
00:14:11,291 --> 00:14:14,250
[Miki] Commander! Iron Berger
is now in take-off position!

197
00:14:14,333 --> 00:14:16,458
What?! Murase?!

198
00:14:16,541 --> 00:14:18,041
No worries, Commander.

199
00:14:18,125 --> 00:14:21,958
We'll cover Big One 'til
Bulge gets the job done.

200
00:14:22,041 --> 00:14:27,583
Very well, Captain. Iron
Berger is clear for take-off.

201
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:30,166
Put the hammer down!
Let's roll!

202
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:42,291
A barrage of energy
beams is approaching!

203
00:14:42,375 --> 00:14:47,083
Fortify the Magnetic Shield!
Arm the Auxiliary Battery!

204
00:14:47,166 --> 00:14:49,791
Mr. Akatsuki! Is the
Main Battery ready?!

205
00:14:49,875 --> 00:14:53,250
Not yet! We
need more time!

206
00:14:53,333 --> 00:14:54,708
[Yuki] Orbit Ring
destroyed!

207
00:14:54,791 --> 00:14:57,916
Damn! The
transducer's fried!

208
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,083
We don't
have a spare!

209
00:14:59,166 --> 00:15:01,083
T'hell with it!
Run a bypass!

210
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:02,333
Right!!

211
00:15:02,416 --> 00:15:09,458
Whitman! Guide us
through this, old friend!

212
00:15:09,541 --> 00:15:13,333
Heat-seekers approaching!!
Preparing to intercept!

213
00:15:13,416 --> 00:15:14,333
Fire!!

214
00:15:22,416 --> 00:15:23,958
Our shields have
been compromised!

215
00:15:24,041 --> 00:15:25,833
Another hit like
that could be fatal!

216
00:15:25,916 --> 00:15:27,458
We've got to strike
now or we're dead!

217
00:15:27,541 --> 00:15:29,250
We need the
Cosmo Matrix!

218
00:15:29,333 --> 00:15:30,833
[Akatsuki]
It's not ready!!

219
00:15:43,583 --> 00:15:45,208
Iron Berger's here!

220
00:15:45,291 --> 00:15:46,708
I'll be damned!

221
00:15:46,791 --> 00:15:49,125
Bulge! Do you
mind if I cut in?

222
00:15:49,208 --> 00:15:50,375
Please do!

223
00:15:50,458 --> 00:15:55,250
Let's rock, boys!
Open the bow!!

224
00:15:55,333 --> 00:15:58,250
This is it, Vega Platoon!
Let's show 'em what we've got!

225
00:15:58,333 --> 00:15:59,708
--Yeah!!
--Right on!

226
00:15:59,791 --> 00:16:00,916
Fire!

227
00:16:16,833 --> 00:16:17,791
They did it!

228
00:16:17,875 --> 00:16:19,250
That was awesome!

229
00:16:19,333 --> 00:16:21,541
[Bulge] Thanks,
Murase! You saved our skin!

230
00:16:21,625 --> 00:16:24,833
So what else is new?!
We do it all the time!

231
00:16:30,791 --> 00:16:33,750
Great! We've got more
turkeys to fry, boys!

232
00:16:33,833 --> 00:16:36,916
Hey, Silver!
Re-charge the Gustav!

233
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,250
Massive energy
discharge on the way, Sir!

234
00:16:39,333 --> 00:16:41,000
Murase!!

235
00:16:44,333 --> 00:16:47,458
[Silver] The operating
system's down! Dammit!

236
00:16:52,875 --> 00:16:56,166
Grab a hold! Come
on, Schnader! Hurry!

237
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:59,333
I can't... I
can't move, Silver.

238
00:16:59,416 --> 00:17:00,083
I'm coming!

239
00:17:00,166 --> 00:17:01,416
No! Stay!!

240
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:06,000
I'm finished... They
still need you Silver.

241
00:17:07,833 --> 00:17:10,458
Schnader, no!

242
00:17:10,541 --> 00:17:12,125
Schnader!

243
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:16,708
Schnader!!

244
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:27,125
You're gonna pay for
this, you Alfort bastards!!

245
00:17:27,208 --> 00:17:28,291
[Screaming]

246
00:17:41,833 --> 00:17:44,166
Jose! It's me!
Silver!

247
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:51,333
Hey! It's not
so bad... Huh?

248
00:17:51,416 --> 00:17:53,375
Jose.

249
00:17:55,375 --> 00:17:56,791
[Bulge] Murase!

250
00:17:56,875 --> 00:18:00,000
Don't worry, Bulge. I've just
got a few more scars now.

251
00:18:00,083 --> 00:18:00,958
No big deal.

252
00:18:01,041 --> 00:18:02,166
[Bulge] Engineering!!

253
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:04,500
Almost done! Just
a few more minutes!

254
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:06,375
The bypass is
ready now, Sir!

255
00:18:06,458 --> 00:18:08,666
Good! Let's
get this done!

256
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:12,166
Murase! Withdraw!
You've done enough!

257
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:17,041
Do you hear me?!
Get out of there!!

258
00:18:17,125 --> 00:18:21,458
Captain! They're
launching another attack!!

259
00:18:21,541 --> 00:18:25,083
This is what happens when
you mess with Vega Platoon!

260
00:18:25,166 --> 00:18:27,375
I'm still with
you, Captain!

261
00:18:29,958 --> 00:18:34,458
[Murase Roaring]

262
00:18:47,125 --> 00:18:48,125
Murase.

263
00:18:50,125 --> 00:18:57,458
This is Captain Murase.
We've done all we can here.

264
00:18:57,541 --> 00:19:03,166
The future is in your
hands now, Sirius Platoon.

265
00:19:05,708 --> 00:19:12,208
Iron Berger... out.

266
00:19:12,291 --> 00:19:17,375
Goodbye, Julia...
I love you.

267
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,958
[Akatsuki] The modifications
are complete! Fire it, Manabu!

268
00:19:30,041 --> 00:19:33,750
What the hell are
you doing?!! Fire!!

269
00:19:33,833 --> 00:19:34,791
Manabu.

270
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:41,625
Be strong! Mind
your post! Let's go!

271
00:19:41,708 --> 00:19:43,666
Preparing to fire
the Main Battery!

272
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:45,750
Targeting the Alfort
Command Ship!

273
00:19:45,833 --> 00:19:49,166
Ready? Fire!!

274
00:19:58,208 --> 00:19:59,333
Direct hit!!

275
00:19:59,416 --> 00:20:00,916
Let's go!
Right Now!

276
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,375
Right!

277
00:20:02,458 --> 00:20:03,750
Turn Hard to
port! Now!!

278
00:20:03,833 --> 00:20:06,708
Go Full ahead to the
center of the Alfort Fleet!

279
00:20:24,875 --> 00:20:27,625
Jose.

280
00:20:27,708 --> 00:20:32,291
Silver... Schnader.

281
00:20:32,375 --> 00:20:34,750
Captain Murase.

282
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:14,166
Murase.

283
00:21:18,041 --> 00:21:22,791
Young men and women of the
SDF- so brave and passionate.

284
00:21:22,875 --> 00:21:25,958
Your sacrifices will
not be forgotten.

285
00:21:26,041 --> 00:21:30,625
They will live on in our
hearts, in every child's smile,

286
00:21:30,708 --> 00:21:33,583
in every
breath we take.

287
00:23:23,541 --> 00:23:24,833
Time is
running out

288
00:23:24,916 --> 00:23:27,875
as the Alfort Fleet closes
in on Destiny Station.

289
00:23:27,958 --> 00:23:30,958
The fate of the galaxy
lies with one heart.

290
00:23:31,041 --> 00:23:33,833
Manabu and the rest of
crew must have a plan and,

291
00:23:33,916 --> 00:23:36,166
above all else, hope...

292
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:39,416
We'll see you one last
time... on the Railways!
