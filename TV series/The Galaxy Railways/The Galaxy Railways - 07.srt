1
00:01:46,416 --> 00:01:48,541
On the last
Galaxy Railways

2
00:01:48,625 --> 00:01:50,375
many innocent
lives were lost

3
00:01:50,458 --> 00:01:53,041
when a bomb ripped
apart a train.

4
00:01:53,125 --> 00:01:56,208
The Space Defense Force was
on high alert trying to find

5
00:01:56,291 --> 00:02:00,208
the author of this dark
chapter in Railways history.

6
00:02:00,291 --> 00:02:04,208
Little did they know, the real
horrors were about to begin.

7
00:02:09,333 --> 00:02:12,125
What darkness in a man's
mind is so complete

8
00:02:12,208 --> 00:02:16,041
that it causes him to lash
out and murder innocent people?

9
00:02:16,125 --> 00:02:18,208
What hopelessness
is so consuming

10
00:02:18,291 --> 00:02:21,708
that it causes him to
destroy the hope of others?

11
00:02:21,791 --> 00:02:24,166
Spica Platoon has
just reported that the

12
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:27,375
Altair Two-twenty-four Express
is completely destroyed.

13
00:02:27,458 --> 00:02:28,666
There are
no survivors.

14
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:30,208
Sirius Platoon
reporting:

15
00:02:30,291 --> 00:02:32,666
the Regulus Eight Eleven
Express is demolished!

16
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:34,375
No survivors found!

17
00:02:34,458 --> 00:02:36,250
Dispatch all Platoons
to Addylos Junction.

18
00:02:36,333 --> 00:02:40,333
I want a full report as
soon as they arrive.

19
00:02:40,416 --> 00:02:42,333
[Waitress] Here you
go, guys. Dig in.

20
00:02:42,416 --> 00:02:43,958
Thank you...

21
00:02:44,041 --> 00:02:46,500
Here!
...Don't worry.

22
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:48,750
I'm sure they'll take
you back, Manabu.

23
00:02:48,833 --> 00:02:50,125
I don't want
to go back.

24
00:02:50,208 --> 00:02:53,250
Now that's
a good one!

25
00:02:53,333 --> 00:02:55,833
So you got crossways
with the big brass;

26
00:02:55,916 --> 00:02:58,333
you just need to kiss some
butt for a while! That's all!

27
00:02:58,416 --> 00:03:00,291
Please, come in!
Have a seat!

28
00:03:06,416 --> 00:03:07,916
Are you all
right, man?

29
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,958
Yeah, I'm fine. Just
hungry. Hey, that's good.

30
00:03:13,041 --> 00:03:14,416
Not too
bad, huh?

31
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,208
It tastes a lot
like my Mom's.

32
00:03:16,291 --> 00:03:17,750
Just what the
doctor ordered!

33
00:03:17,833 --> 00:03:19,791
Y'know You just needed to
get away from the office

34
00:03:19,875 --> 00:03:22,458
for a while. The
SDF can be stuffy.

35
00:03:22,541 --> 00:03:23,958
That's an organization
with history.

36
00:03:24,041 --> 00:03:25,083
They've got a
pecking order.

37
00:03:25,166 --> 00:03:27,000
They don't want some
kid jumping rank;

38
00:03:27,083 --> 00:03:30,000
they want you to do exactly
what they tell you to do.

39
00:03:30,083 --> 00:03:32,958
But I've got to do
what I think is right!

40
00:03:33,041 --> 00:03:37,125
You can be a lion, but you have
to be a lamb first, my friend.

41
00:03:37,208 --> 00:03:40,416
It's not that easy... 
I can't watch people die.

42
00:03:43,375 --> 00:03:46,541
I joined because I want
to help people...

43
00:03:46,625 --> 00:03:48,708
Sometimes I feel like
they're sleepwalking...

44
00:03:48,791 --> 00:03:51,291
Like all they know how
to do is play it safe.

45
00:03:57,083 --> 00:03:58,916
The whole
station's on fire!

46
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,166
It's too late to
do anything now.

47
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:06,041
I wonder how many people
are on that sub-station.

48
00:04:06,125 --> 00:04:08,916
Louis. Report to Headquarters.
Tell them what's going on.

49
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,916
Yes, Captain...
Come in, Headquarters...

50
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,458
This is
Sirius Platoon.

51
00:04:13,541 --> 00:04:15,500
Addylos Junction is
engulfed in flames...

52
00:04:15,583 --> 00:04:17,875
Rescue operations
are impossible.

53
00:04:17,958 --> 00:04:19,791
There will be
no survivors.

54
00:04:25,416 --> 00:04:28,458
Who is it? What kind of
sick maniac would do this?!

55
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:36,833
So why don't you just
turn in your monkey suit

56
00:04:36,916 --> 00:04:38,500
and quit
the SDF?

57
00:04:38,583 --> 00:04:40,208
Just walk away
from it all?

58
00:04:40,291 --> 00:04:41,708
Maybe it's
not your thing.

59
00:04:41,791 --> 00:04:44,875
That seems to be the
general consensus... Huh?

60
00:04:44,958 --> 00:04:47,125
Well, maybe they're
right, man...

61
00:04:47,208 --> 00:04:49,208
You don't seem
like SDF to me.

62
00:04:49,291 --> 00:04:50,250
I don't?

63
00:04:50,333 --> 00:04:52,375
Naa, all those guys
have big egos...

64
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:54,041
they don't care about
helping people;

65
00:04:54,125 --> 00:04:56,208
they just want to
boss somebody around.

66
00:04:56,291 --> 00:04:59,041
That's what they live for,
buddy. Do this! Do that!

67
00:04:59,125 --> 00:05:01,708
Some of 'em do
seem to enjoy it.

68
00:05:01,791 --> 00:05:05,125
That's what I'm telling
you! They're lame!

69
00:05:05,208 --> 00:05:08,000
This is good.
Right here, Shaw.

70
00:05:12,958 --> 00:05:13,875
Hey,
Manabu.

71
00:05:13,958 --> 00:05:15,208
Huh?

72
00:05:15,291 --> 00:05:18,041
Good luck. You're not
like those other SDF guys.

73
00:05:18,125 --> 00:05:20,291
You really want
to help people.

74
00:05:20,375 --> 00:05:22,750
Don't let
'em rob ya.

75
00:05:22,833 --> 00:05:25,333
Don't let those guys
steal your dream from you.

76
00:05:25,416 --> 00:05:29,208
Don't let those guys turn
you into one of them...

77
00:05:29,291 --> 00:05:30,958
Check ya
later!

78
00:05:37,166 --> 00:05:39,666
Forget them, Manabu.
They're not worth it.

79
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:40,875
...completely destroyed.

80
00:05:40,958 --> 00:05:43,083
No one survived the
bomb's deadly explosion.

81
00:05:43,166 --> 00:05:44,625
The high death toll

82
00:05:44,708 --> 00:05:46,958
makes this the worst disaster
in Galaxy Railways history.

83
00:05:47,041 --> 00:05:48,916
Railways officials
believe that terrorists

84
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,125
are responsible for the
bombings but as of yet,

85
00:05:51,208 --> 00:05:52,750
no one has claimed
responsibility

86
00:05:52,833 --> 00:05:54,375
for either of
the attacks.

87
00:05:54,458 --> 00:05:56,958
One common thread
linking the incidents...

88
00:05:59,375 --> 00:06:02,000
Weapons expert, Doctor
Eugene Talbert is here

89
00:06:02,083 --> 00:06:03,666
to tell us about
the bomb. Doctor?

90
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:06,666
Yes, it's called a
Dissolving Sub-atomic Bomb.

91
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:08,875
This is an early
version of the weapon.

92
00:06:08,958 --> 00:06:11,125
It was first used by
the Liberation Army

93
00:06:11,208 --> 00:06:13,916
on Planet Rommel in
the battle for Aldebran.

94
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,541
Since then the bomb has become
much more sophisticated.

95
00:06:16,625 --> 00:06:18,791
By using Feglinole as
the key ingredient

96
00:06:18,875 --> 00:06:21,583
the explosive power of the
bomb has increased ten-fold.

97
00:06:21,666 --> 00:06:22,500
[Layla]
Manabu!

98
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:26,500
Keep moving forward.
Have faith in your self.

99
00:06:26,583 --> 00:06:29,333
Who was that?

100
00:06:33,375 --> 00:06:34,750
This just in:

101
00:06:34,833 --> 00:06:36,333
one of the passengers on the
Three-twenty-three Express

102
00:06:36,416 --> 00:06:38,291
destroyed while en
route to Great Magellan

103
00:06:38,375 --> 00:06:39,625
in the first
terrorist bombing--

104
00:06:39,708 --> 00:06:41,000
was brought back
to life today

105
00:06:41,083 --> 00:06:43,250
after she was pronounced
clinically dead.

106
00:06:43,333 --> 00:06:45,708
Yuki, the Medical Officer
assigned to Sirius Platoon,

107
00:06:45,791 --> 00:06:48,833
resuscitated the miracle
child, Miss Sarah Aihara.

108
00:06:48,916 --> 00:06:51,041
Her recovery marks
the only hopeful news

109
00:06:51,125 --> 00:06:53,708
in the otherwise tragic
events of recent days.

110
00:07:13,041 --> 00:07:15,583
Captain
Bulge!

111
00:07:15,666 --> 00:07:17,666
Sarah survived
thanks to you...

112
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:21,958
She has a tough
road ahead of her.

113
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:25,375
Manabu... Sometimes we
witness horrible things

114
00:07:25,458 --> 00:07:27,916
while doing this job.
It's unavoidable...

115
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,041
There are many times
when we're powerless

116
00:07:30,125 --> 00:07:31,750
to do anything
about it.

117
00:07:31,833 --> 00:07:33,333
When I decide what
action to take

118
00:07:33,416 --> 00:07:37,166
I have to consider the safety
of everyone that's involved...

119
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:39,291
It's not always
easy to decide...

120
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:42,291
But I expect my decisions
to be obeyed and honored.

121
00:07:43,541 --> 00:07:44,791
We have to
be a team.

122
00:07:44,875 --> 00:07:47,041
Our wills have to be
as one to survive...

123
00:07:47,125 --> 00:07:50,708
We have to depend on one
another completely...

124
00:07:50,791 --> 00:07:53,875
I was told these same things
years ago by your Father.

125
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:06,708
Well, maybe they're right, man.
You don't seem like SDF to me.

126
00:08:06,791 --> 00:08:07,750
I don't?

127
00:08:07,833 --> 00:08:10,125
Naa, all those guys
have big egos.

128
00:08:10,208 --> 00:08:11,916
They don't care about
helping people;

129
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,666
they just want to
boss somebody around.

130
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:16,666
[Buldge] I expect my decisions
to be obeyed and honored.

131
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:19,416
You want to protect the
Galaxy without firing a shot.

132
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,416
You can gamble your
own life on that ideal

133
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,500
but not the lives of
your platoon members.

134
00:08:23,583 --> 00:08:25,583
Don't let them steal your
dream from you.

135
00:08:25,666 --> 00:08:27,916
Don't let those guys turn
you into one of them...

136
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,583
Captain
Bulge! Wait!

137
00:08:30,666 --> 00:08:33,375
Well, What's on
your mind, Manabu?

138
00:08:33,458 --> 00:08:35,375
I'd like to make
a request...

139
00:08:35,458 --> 00:08:39,458
Can you please end
my suspension, Sir?

140
00:08:39,541 --> 00:08:41,625
Look, I don't know
if I can change...

141
00:08:41,708 --> 00:08:43,375
But you have my
absolute loyalty.

142
00:08:43,458 --> 00:08:46,125
I'll do anything for
you. Please, Captain!

143
00:08:46,208 --> 00:08:48,666
Take me back!
I beg of you!

144
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:53,333
It's your choice... I've told
you that already, Manabu.

145
00:08:53,416 --> 00:08:55,833
Captain!

146
00:08:55,916 --> 00:08:57,041
Go to the
outfitting room

147
00:08:57,125 --> 00:08:58,958
and get your uniform
on immediately!

148
00:08:59,041 --> 00:09:00,625
All of our space-trains
will be shipping out

149
00:09:00,708 --> 00:09:02,500
as soon as the tune
ups are completed!

150
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:04,541
Don't be
late, Manabu!

151
00:09:04,625 --> 00:09:08,833
We have some terrorists
that we need to track down!

152
00:09:08,916 --> 00:09:10,666
Yes, Sir!

153
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:11,666
System Check!

154
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:13,458
Standby for
system check

155
00:09:13,541 --> 00:09:15,625
Orbit Network
Radar ready!

156
00:09:15,708 --> 00:09:18,041
Sub-atomic Warp
Generator ready!

157
00:09:18,125 --> 00:09:20,375
I am
so Sorry

158
00:09:20,458 --> 00:09:22,625
for all the trouble I've
caused the platoon, you guys!

159
00:09:22,708 --> 00:09:25,125
That was the past.
Take your seat, Manabu.

160
00:09:25,208 --> 00:09:25,833
Right!

161
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:32,000
Big One is now in
take-off position!

162
00:09:32,083 --> 00:09:35,333
Cylinder Valves are open!
Atomic Boiler Pressure is a go!

163
00:09:35,416 --> 00:09:37,666
The Warp-drive coupling
is now in place!

164
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:39,041
The Main Circuit
is online!

165
00:09:39,125 --> 00:09:41,333
All energy levels
ready for take-off!

166
00:09:41,416 --> 00:09:43,416
Let's move out!
Ahead full!

167
00:10:02,416 --> 00:10:04,000
Hope you had a nice
vacation...

168
00:10:04,083 --> 00:10:07,250
Maybe now you'll take
this job more seriously.

169
00:10:07,333 --> 00:10:09,000
I've always taken
it seriously.

170
00:10:09,083 --> 00:10:11,166
I'm glad you haven't
lost your winning charm.

171
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:15,833
There they go,
City of Hope-

172
00:10:15,916 --> 00:10:18,333
our valiant warriors riding
their trains of light

173
00:10:18,416 --> 00:10:20,041
into the
darkness of space.

174
00:10:20,125 --> 00:10:23,458
This next song is for the
men and women of the SDF.

175
00:10:40,666 --> 00:10:42,250
The Fort Worth is
just ahead, Captain.

176
00:10:42,333 --> 00:10:44,708
Point Three
Megameters to go.

177
00:10:44,791 --> 00:10:46,333
Pull up
parallel, Bruce.

178
00:10:46,416 --> 00:10:47,291
Will do,
Captain.

179
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:52,958
I've informed the
passengers that this is

180
00:10:53,041 --> 00:10:55,166
a precautionary search
and evacuation.

181
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:57,416
They're ready to make
the transfer, Sir.

182
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:57,791
Good.

183
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:07,541
Maintain
current speed;

184
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:09,916
lower the shield and
connect the Space Walk!

185
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,833
I want all
passengers transferred

186
00:11:11,916 --> 00:11:13,958
to the rear
coach of Big One!

187
00:11:22,416 --> 00:11:28,916
The exterior is clear. There's
no bomb out here, Captain.

188
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,791
All clear on
the interior so far.

189
00:11:30,875 --> 00:11:32,333
We're checking
the lounge now.

190
00:11:38,125 --> 00:11:42,333
What is it? Did
you find something?

191
00:11:42,416 --> 00:11:44,500
I hope not.

192
00:11:57,041 --> 00:11:58,125
Hey,
Kinuko?

193
00:11:58,208 --> 00:11:59,791
Yes,
what's up?

194
00:11:59,875 --> 00:12:01,375
Your son
that you lost;

195
00:12:01,458 --> 00:12:04,125
wasn't he killed in a
Galaxy Railways accident.

196
00:12:04,208 --> 00:12:06,291
Hm? Oh yes,
he was.

197
00:12:06,375 --> 00:12:08,958
Then why do you still cater
to the Galaxy Railways?

198
00:12:09,041 --> 00:12:10,041
Doesn't that
make you mad?

199
00:12:10,125 --> 00:12:11,958
That's a
good question.

200
00:12:12,041 --> 00:12:15,625
I guess because my son loved
the Galaxy Railways so much...

201
00:12:15,708 --> 00:12:18,791
Why the sudden interest?
You never asked before.

202
00:12:18,875 --> 00:12:20,166
Just curious.
That's all.

203
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:20,875
Hmm.

204
00:12:20,958 --> 00:12:25,916
No!
...Please!

205
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,083
I don't know
your Mother,

206
00:12:27,166 --> 00:12:29,333
but I'll bet she's
one happy lady, Shaw!

207
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:33,750
How can she not be
with a son like you?!

208
00:12:33,833 --> 00:12:36,291
You know, this rain's
only going to get worse...

209
00:12:36,375 --> 00:12:38,875
Maybe you should close
shop early today

210
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:40,791
That's not
a bad idea.

211
00:12:40,875 --> 00:12:42,208
Can you come
with me then?

212
00:12:42,291 --> 00:12:43,958
I have a little
favor to ask you.

213
00:13:03,208 --> 00:13:05,375
Halt! This is a
restricted area!

214
00:13:05,458 --> 00:13:08,375
Only authorized personnel
can pass this point!

215
00:13:13,541 --> 00:13:15,333
Stop or we
will fire!

216
00:13:18,208 --> 00:13:19,125
Anything?

217
00:13:19,208 --> 00:13:21,750
Not yet...
Hey!

218
00:13:27,875 --> 00:13:31,750
Huh?
There's no way!

219
00:13:31,833 --> 00:13:33,708
[Announcement] Rigel Platoon
has just finished disposing of

220
00:13:33,791 --> 00:13:36,750
two bombs bombs on the
Five-Seventy-Six Express!

221
00:13:36,833 --> 00:13:38,375
The Three-Eighty-Eight
bound for Perseus

222
00:13:38,458 --> 00:13:40,333
is passing through
the Double Clusters.

223
00:13:40,416 --> 00:13:43,125
Capella Platoon will
intersect in three minutes.

224
00:13:43,208 --> 00:13:44,333
Security breech!

225
00:13:44,416 --> 00:13:45,791
An intruder has entered
the restricted area!

226
00:13:45,875 --> 00:13:47,291
The guard-bots are
not responding!

227
00:13:47,375 --> 00:13:49,916
The intruder is
armed and dangerous!

228
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,708
Huh? Shaw! Someone
broke through security!

229
00:13:52,791 --> 00:13:54,166
I'd be careful!
It could be a terrorist!

230
00:13:59,833 --> 00:14:02,833
This has been a real
eye-opener for me.

231
00:14:14,166 --> 00:14:18,041
Hey, Manabu! Nice work!
...Brilliant really.

232
00:14:18,125 --> 00:14:22,208
Who would have guessed that
the terrorist was a vendor?

233
00:14:22,291 --> 00:14:23,541
Hey, what's
the matter?

234
00:14:23,625 --> 00:14:27,083
Captain... Can we please
go back to headquarters?

235
00:14:27,875 --> 00:14:28,958
What are you
talking about?

236
00:14:29,041 --> 00:14:30,708
...We have more
trains to check!

237
00:14:30,791 --> 00:14:33,291
What's on your mind,
Manabu! Explain yourself!

238
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:38,583
I think I know
who the bomber is!

239
00:14:43,375 --> 00:14:47,583
I met him when I was suspended.
He hates the SDF... It's him!

240
00:14:51,541 --> 00:14:52,916
If we hadn't
discovered the bombs,

241
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,458
all these trains would have
blown up. Don't you see!?

242
00:14:55,541 --> 00:14:57,625
He knew what Headquarters
would do if that happened!

243
00:14:57,708 --> 00:14:59,291
Dispatch the
entire fleet.

244
00:14:59,375 --> 00:15:02,416
That's what he wanted...
to create a disaster so big

245
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,000
that we were all
sent out at once!

246
00:15:04,083 --> 00:15:06,375
Which means his real
target is Headquarters.

247
00:15:13,708 --> 00:15:15,041
Hmm.

248
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,791
Would he really
attack Headquarters?

249
00:15:18,875 --> 00:15:21,583
Why not? He's definitely
crazy enough to try.

250
00:15:21,666 --> 00:15:23,708
Captain. I say we
head back, Sir.

251
00:15:23,791 --> 00:15:25,250
Let's hope it's
not too late.

252
00:15:25,333 --> 00:15:27,333
Louis! Contact
Headquarters!

253
00:15:27,416 --> 00:15:28,833
Patch me through
to the Commander!

254
00:15:28,916 --> 00:15:31,458
Yes, Sir!

255
00:15:31,541 --> 00:15:32,666
What is it?

256
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:34,333
All channels are down!
There's no response!

257
00:15:36,583 --> 00:15:37,708
Let's move!

258
00:15:37,791 --> 00:15:39,083
Give our assignments
to the other platoons!

259
00:15:39,166 --> 00:15:41,083
Plot a course
for Headquarters!

260
00:15:41,166 --> 00:15:41,750
[All]
Yes, Sir!

261
00:15:45,375 --> 00:15:47,625
[Shaw] Attention
all SDF Platoons,

262
00:15:47,708 --> 00:15:49,500
yes, this is
Headquarters speaking.

263
00:15:49,583 --> 00:15:50,916
From this
moment on

264
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,916
the operation of all lines
is officially terminated.

265
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,750
We greatly appreciate
your mindless servitude.

266
00:15:56,833 --> 00:15:59,041
Do not return to
Destiny Station

267
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:01,333
unless you want to
sacrifice your lives

268
00:16:01,416 --> 00:16:05,125
for the Galaxy Railways.
Headquarters out.

269
00:16:07,208 --> 00:16:09,333
Thanks buddy... I really
appreciate the use

270
00:16:09,416 --> 00:16:11,708
of your
com system

271
00:16:11,791 --> 00:16:14,250
Why don't you let the
others go? I'll stay.

272
00:16:14,333 --> 00:16:16,041
Now that would take
all the fun out of it.

273
00:16:16,125 --> 00:16:18,791
Wouldn't it, big man.
This is a company party.

274
00:16:21,166 --> 00:16:22,875
The day
has come...

275
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:25,375
The darkness has
eclipsed the light.

276
00:16:25,458 --> 00:16:27,375
Just What is it that
you mean to accomplish?

277
00:16:27,458 --> 00:16:28,583
Nothing
really...

278
00:16:28,666 --> 00:16:31,916
Just the destruction
of the Galaxy Railways!

279
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,583
So then
young man...

280
00:16:34,666 --> 00:16:37,791
I see you've come here
just as I expected you to.

281
00:16:37,875 --> 00:16:39,333
What are you
talking about?!

282
00:16:39,416 --> 00:16:42,916
You had no way of knowing I
was coming here! Who are you?!

283
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,458
You look so
full of yourself.

284
00:16:45,541 --> 00:16:50,083
Of course! You're the Supreme
Commander! Aren't you?!

285
00:16:50,166 --> 00:16:54,291
No! Please! I have to stay
on board! Let me stay!

286
00:16:54,375 --> 00:16:59,166
You don't understand!
I have to get to Melder!

287
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:02,416
Tickets to Planet Melder are
available at the ticket office.

288
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:05,250
I don't have any money but
I'll pay you back! I swear!

289
00:17:05,333 --> 00:17:07,041
I'm sorry, it's
against the rules.

290
00:17:07,125 --> 00:17:10,291
Please! My mom's
sick! She'll die!

291
00:17:10,375 --> 00:17:12,166
I have to get
to Planet Melder!

292
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:14,708
The doctor said that's
where the medicine is!

293
00:17:14,791 --> 00:17:17,458
No! Please! Stop!

294
00:17:17,541 --> 00:17:19,708
Halt!

295
00:17:19,791 --> 00:17:25,458
No!! Wait!!
Please!! Stop!

296
00:17:25,541 --> 00:17:30,041
What's wrong with you people?!
Let me get on! Help me!!!

297
00:17:36,083 --> 00:17:39,125
I can feel you
inside my head!

298
00:17:39,208 --> 00:17:41,583
I hope to God that I'm
wrong about you, Shaw!

299
00:17:41,666 --> 00:17:43,791
I don't know what
you are, lady!

300
00:17:43,875 --> 00:17:45,625
But you can't read my
mind if you're dead!

301
00:17:45,708 --> 00:17:49,291
Don't
do it!!

302
00:17:49,375 --> 00:17:50,583
Shaw!
No!

303
00:17:50,666 --> 00:17:51,250
Manabu.

304
00:17:51,916 --> 00:17:53,250
He's by
himself.

305
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,166
Now, now.
Cut me some slack.

306
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:11,375
Don't give me
that look, man...

307
00:18:11,458 --> 00:18:13,750
I see you're back
in your monkey suit.

308
00:18:13,833 --> 00:18:16,250
Why, Shaw? Why are
you doing this?

309
00:18:16,333 --> 00:18:20,125
Trust me. I have
my reasons, Manabu.

310
00:18:20,208 --> 00:18:21,625
But you're
a good person!

311
00:18:21,708 --> 00:18:24,166
I was. But they
changed that! Heh!

312
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:25,833
Huh?!
No! Wait!

313
00:18:26,583 --> 00:18:29,666
This is for all the
people you killed!

314
00:18:34,625 --> 00:18:36,791
Stop it!
That's enough!

315
00:18:37,125 --> 00:18:39,583
Hey! Whose side are
you on? Back off!!

316
00:18:40,208 --> 00:18:41,916
Manabu!

317
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:47,708
Shaw.

318
00:18:47,791 --> 00:18:49,541
Is that all
you got?!

319
00:18:49,625 --> 00:18:52,625
...Come on! Bring it
you SDF freaks!

320
00:18:52,708 --> 00:18:54,625
...Go 'head! Right
there! I dare ya!

321
00:18:54,708 --> 00:18:56,250
You asked for
it, Crazy man!

322
00:18:59,083 --> 00:19:00,208
Huh?!
Silver!

323
00:19:00,291 --> 00:19:02,000
That's an atomic weapon
that he's got on!

324
00:19:02,083 --> 00:19:04,083
If you shoot we're all
history! Understand?

325
00:19:05,208 --> 00:19:07,041
He didn't plan to
leave here alive.

326
00:19:07,125 --> 00:19:09,541
A bomb like that would
level this place.

327
00:19:09,625 --> 00:19:10,916
That's what
he wants.

328
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:15,916
Had a change of heart?
...All right! I'll do it!

329
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,500
...You guys are more
useless than I thought!

330
00:19:21,291 --> 00:19:22,375
Aim for
his head.

331
00:19:22,458 --> 00:19:24,416
Shaw!
Don't do it!

332
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:25,250
Manabu! No!

333
00:19:25,333 --> 00:19:26,250
Oh, crap!

334
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:28,875
No! Get out
of the way!

335
00:19:28,958 --> 00:19:31,958
Shaw! Don't do
this! Please!

336
00:19:32,041 --> 00:19:33,250
Yuuki.

337
00:19:33,333 --> 00:19:34,708
Please, Shaw!

338
00:19:34,791 --> 00:19:36,458
I don't want to
have to use this!

339
00:19:36,541 --> 00:19:39,250
I don't want to have
to hurt you! Please!

340
00:19:39,333 --> 00:19:41,083
Yeah,
right man.

341
00:19:41,166 --> 00:19:43,416
Why, Shaw? Why are
you doing this?

342
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:44,750
Look at me,
Manabu.

343
00:19:44,833 --> 00:19:47,583
The Galaxy Railways turned
me into what I am today.

344
00:19:47,666 --> 00:19:49,291
They wouldn't let me
take a free ride

345
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:50,791
to save
my Mother

346
00:19:50,875 --> 00:19:52,750
but they spent hundreds of
thousands giving me this body

347
00:19:52,833 --> 00:19:54,625
after they
ran over mine.

348
00:19:54,708 --> 00:19:57,791
Look. I was just a
boy when they did this.

349
00:19:57,875 --> 00:19:59,291
They don't care
about you, Buddy.

350
00:19:59,375 --> 00:20:01,750
Hmph. They don't
care about anyone.

351
00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:04,625
The Galaxy Railways is a
monster without a heart.

352
00:20:04,708 --> 00:20:05,708
You're wrong.

353
00:20:05,791 --> 00:20:07,666
Your Father and
Brother died for them!

354
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:10,583
Do you think they care?! And
now you're defending them!

355
00:20:10,666 --> 00:20:12,083
You're the one
who's crazy!

356
00:20:16,041 --> 00:20:19,833
No! ...My Father and my
brother sacrificed their lives

357
00:20:19,916 --> 00:20:22,750
because they believed
in the Galaxy Railways!

358
00:20:22,833 --> 00:20:24,208
Whether the
trains carry hate

359
00:20:24,291 --> 00:20:26,708
or hopes and dreams is up to
us! We're the passengers!

360
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:29,000
Blowing up those
trains was wrong,

361
00:20:29,083 --> 00:20:30,666
no matter what
the reason.

362
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:32,625
I'm sorry about what
happened, Shaw!

363
00:20:32,708 --> 00:20:34,541
But the killing
stops here!

364
00:20:34,625 --> 00:20:37,166
I can't let you
hurt anyone else!

365
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:40,416
I understand your passion,
Manabu. Now understand mine!

366
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:43,125
If they were all like you I
wouldn't have to do this.

367
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:51,416
Damn!

368
00:20:53,041 --> 00:20:56,625
Aaaahh!
No!!!

369
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:05,166
Oh,
Manabu.

370
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:07,500
Oh, hey,
Kinuko.

371
00:21:07,583 --> 00:21:09,458
I have something
for ya.

372
00:21:09,541 --> 00:21:11,333
For me?
What is it?

373
00:21:11,416 --> 00:21:14,041
I'm not sure. Shaw asked
me to give it to you.

374
00:21:14,958 --> 00:21:16,541
He found it in the
back of his warehouse.

375
00:21:16,625 --> 00:21:21,791
It was the last one... He said
to mind the expiration date.

376
00:21:21,875 --> 00:21:24,583
Three days. That's a lot
of Tabito Tea to drink

377
00:21:24,666 --> 00:21:27,458
in three
days, Shaw.

378
00:21:27,541 --> 00:21:29,333
Why do bad things
happen to good people?

379
00:21:29,416 --> 00:21:31,541
Is it simply
happenstance?

380
00:21:31,625 --> 00:21:35,583
Or are the victims of today
the transgressors of the past?

381
00:21:35,666 --> 00:21:38,625
Are we simply experiencing
what we've caused others

382
00:21:38,708 --> 00:21:41,666
to experience in
lives gone by?

383
00:23:25,291 --> 00:23:26,458
Training under Whitman,

384
00:23:26,541 --> 00:23:28,791
the SDF's Chief mechanic,
is no can of tea.

385
00:23:28,875 --> 00:23:30,416
His love for
trains runs deep;

386
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:33,250
and since his prized locomotive
is heading for the scrapheap,

387
00:23:33,333 --> 00:23:36,166
he disobeys orders and takes
it out for one last ride.

388
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:38,333
Usually, I'm the one
breaking the rules!

389
00:23:38,416 --> 00:23:40,875
See ya next time
on the Railways!
