1
00:00:09,541 --> 00:00:13,583
The infinite universe.
Inconcievably vast.

2
00:00:13,666 --> 00:00:17,125
Where giant stars are
mere pinpricks of light.

3
00:00:17,208 --> 00:00:21,666
What man can fathom this
amazing ocean of life?

4
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:24,083
Are we not but
specks in creation?

5
00:00:24,166 --> 00:00:26,916
And yet we dare to leave
the comfort of our planet

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,250
and venture fourth
into boundless space.

7
00:00:33,916 --> 00:00:36,291
Is there anything more
magnificant to behold

8
00:00:36,375 --> 00:00:38,666
than the swirling
colors of a planet

9
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:42,500
illuminated by the pure
light of a nearby star?

10
00:00:46,541 --> 00:00:49,458
And yet, as beautiful
as the universe is

11
00:00:49,541 --> 00:00:52,000
just a few pebbles out
of place can cause

12
00:00:52,083 --> 00:00:54,541
a catastropic
amount of destruction.

13
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:00,916
Huh?

14
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,333
Mommy, look. I see rocks
flying through the sky.

15
00:01:03,416 --> 00:01:05,000
You do? Where?

16
00:01:05,083 --> 00:01:05,666
Right there!

17
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:06,416
Huh?

18
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:07,583
See!

19
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:20,416
Whoa. What's up?

20
00:01:21,416 --> 00:01:23,875
[Conductor] Please remain
calm. There's nothing to fear.

21
00:01:23,958 --> 00:01:25,875
This train is equipped
with Orbit Shields

22
00:01:25,958 --> 00:01:29,125
and the Railway itself is
protected by a Magnetic Barrier.

23
00:01:29,208 --> 00:01:30,458
You're perfectly safe.

24
00:01:34,333 --> 00:01:35,916
[Little Girl] I'm scared!

25
00:01:39,291 --> 00:01:44,000
Emergency! Emergency!
Engine Number 707 has stopped!

26
00:01:44,083 --> 00:01:46,416
We have a full shutdown
3500 mega-meters

27
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:47,958
from the
Tabito System!

28
00:01:48,041 --> 00:01:49,333
It looks like
asteroids!

29
00:01:49,416 --> 00:01:51,500
[Brad] Their Orbit Shield
has been compromised!

30
00:01:51,583 --> 00:01:54,166
Maximize the power
to the Magnetic Barrier!

31
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:56,666
They're requesting
an SDF dispatch!

32
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:58,333
When it rains,
it pours!

33
00:01:58,416 --> 00:02:00,583
I'm showing a White Hole
forming 500 mega-meters

34
00:02:00,666 --> 00:02:02,125
from the
accident site!

35
00:02:02,208 --> 00:02:04,708
The gravitational
pull is increasing!

36
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:07,166
I want the Space Defense
Force out there right away!

37
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:09,333
Dispatch the Sirius
Platoon! Now!

38
00:02:24,916 --> 00:02:27,083
[Layla] So the Wheel of Fate
has begun to turn

39
00:02:27,166 --> 00:02:28,958
and nothing can be
done to stop it.

40
00:02:29,041 --> 00:02:31,833
Even the mightiest of men
are powerless to resist

41
00:02:31,916 --> 00:02:33,708
the pull of
their own destiny.

42
00:02:33,791 --> 00:02:37,791
They rush to it, even if it
means their destruction.

43
00:02:43,083 --> 00:02:44,541
[Male Passenger]
What's going on?

44
00:02:44,625 --> 00:02:46,708
Why hasn't your headquarters
sent out a rescue team yet?

45
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:48,291
[Female Passenger] What
are they going to do?

46
00:02:48,375 --> 00:02:50,791
Just leave us out here in
the middle of space to die?

47
00:02:50,875 --> 00:02:53,500
[Conductor] Calm down, everyone!
The SDF is on the way.

48
00:02:53,583 --> 00:02:56,458
Please go back to your seats
and relax until they get here!

49
00:02:56,541 --> 00:02:58,541
But we've got injured
people on board!

50
00:02:58,625 --> 00:03:02,125
This isn't the time for an
in-flight movie, you idiot! Huh?

51
00:03:02,208 --> 00:03:04,083
Here comes the SDF
now. Thank goodness.

52
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:10,541
All right people, we need to do
this as efficiently as possible.

53
00:03:11,708 --> 00:03:13,041
If that barrier
breaches, we're sunk!

54
00:03:13,125 --> 00:03:14,541
Let's get them the
hell out of here!

55
00:03:14,625 --> 00:03:15,708
Yes, Sir!

56
00:03:15,791 --> 00:03:17,666
Let go of me!
I'm not a criminal!

57
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:19,625
I didn't do anything!
You big bully!

58
00:03:22,625 --> 00:03:24,166
[Officer] I found
these two stowaways

59
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:25,666
in the hangar-coach, Sir.

60
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:27,791
They both claim that
they know you, Captain.

61
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:29,125
What do you have to
say for yourselves?

62
00:03:29,208 --> 00:03:30,750
I'm sorry, Dad.

63
00:03:30,833 --> 00:03:32,208
Me too, Dad.

64
00:03:34,291 --> 00:03:36,166
These boys are
your sons, Captain?

65
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:37,791
Well, they were until today.

66
00:03:37,875 --> 00:03:41,416
Sorry, Dad. We really didn't
mean for this to happen. Honest.

67
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:44,000
I want to help you with
the rescue mission, Dad!

68
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:46,250
I'll check this one.

69
00:03:48,083 --> 00:03:52,500
Please! Let me help! I want to
join the SDF, Dad! Like you!

70
00:03:52,583 --> 00:03:53,791
Don't be stupid!

71
00:04:04,125 --> 00:04:05,375
[Yuki] Does he
belong to you?

72
00:04:05,458 --> 00:04:08,416
Yes, thanks very much.
But she's actually a girl.

73
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,333
Of course. How
silly of me.

74
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:11,541
Captain Yuuki.

75
00:04:11,625 --> 00:04:12,791
What is it, Bulge?

76
00:04:12,875 --> 00:04:14,708
This is the last of the
passengers. We're clear.

77
00:04:14,791 --> 00:04:16,333
Very good. Let's
get out of here.

78
00:04:16,416 --> 00:04:17,708
Right.

79
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:19,250
Many thanks, Captain.

80
00:04:19,333 --> 00:04:22,458
Yes, of course. That was quite
an ordeal you went through.

81
00:04:22,541 --> 00:04:24,541
You should be proud of
yourself. Well done.

82
00:04:24,625 --> 00:04:26,083
Thank you, Captain.

83
00:04:29,541 --> 00:04:31,125
Check Dad out.
Doesn't he look cool?

84
00:04:31,208 --> 00:04:32,791
Yeah.

85
00:04:32,875 --> 00:04:34,750
Captain, we've got
an emergency!

86
00:04:34,833 --> 00:04:36,250
What is it?

87
00:04:36,333 --> 00:04:38,083
There appears to be a ship
emerging from the White Hole.

88
00:04:38,166 --> 00:04:39,458
What?

89
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:52,875
They're firing at us, Sir!
Energy blasts on the way!

90
00:04:52,958 --> 00:04:54,458
Quick! Full ahead! Now!

91
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:05,166
[Bulge]
Indirect hit, Sir!

92
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:06,208
[Wataru]
Damn it!

93
00:05:06,291 --> 00:05:08,250
Permission to return
fire, Captain!

94
00:05:08,333 --> 00:05:11,208
Negative! We need to get
these passengers to safety!

95
00:05:11,291 --> 00:05:13,250
We'll only return
fire if they pursue!

96
00:05:13,333 --> 00:05:14,166
Yes, Sir!

97
00:05:16,166 --> 00:05:17,625
Incoming fighters!

98
00:05:17,708 --> 00:05:20,625
Opening Orbit Shield, Captain!
Pulse Cannons ready to fire!

99
00:05:20,708 --> 00:05:22,583
[Wataru] On my mark! Fire!

100
00:05:29,375 --> 00:05:32,000
[Wataru] Get away from
there, boys! It's dangerous!

101
00:05:32,083 --> 00:05:33,333
Right. Sorry, Dad.

102
00:05:34,875 --> 00:05:36,291
Dad, I'm scared.

103
00:05:36,375 --> 00:05:39,000
Don't worry.
We'll be fine.

104
00:05:58,916 --> 00:06:05,541
Whoa! A Space-Train! Awesome!
They look so cool at night!

105
00:06:05,625 --> 00:06:07,500
I wonder if
that's Big One?

106
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:10,375
That is Big One!
I know it!

107
00:06:10,458 --> 00:06:12,916
It's him!
He made it! Dad's back!

108
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:16,916
I'd know Dad's
train anywhere!

109
00:06:21,375 --> 00:06:22,916
Stay, boy.

110
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,583
[Villager] Clear for
take-off, Mamoru!

111
00:06:24,666 --> 00:06:26,041
[Mamoru] I wish!

112
00:06:27,333 --> 00:06:30,916
[Mamoru] Mr. Ooiwa!
Your delivery's here! Hello?

113
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,166
[Ooiwa] Does that thing
have wings on it or what?

114
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:35,208
How'd you get
here so fast?

115
00:06:37,291 --> 00:06:39,250
[Mamoru] You sure can put
it away, Mr. Ooiwa.

116
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:42,208
[Ooiwa] That's because
I work so hard.

117
00:06:42,291 --> 00:06:45,875
What about you? Mamoru,
you can't deliver food forever.

118
00:06:45,958 --> 00:06:47,333
What are you going
to do after you graduate?

119
00:06:48,625 --> 00:06:50,041
I don't know.

120
00:06:50,125 --> 00:06:53,708
You're going to join the SDF,
aren't you? I thought so.

121
00:06:55,833 --> 00:07:00,166
Off to the Universe! Ya know,
if I was your age, I'd go too!

122
00:07:08,625 --> 00:07:09,458
[Manabu]
Hey! Mamoru!

123
00:07:09,541 --> 00:07:10,916
I know that voice.

124
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,833
He's back! He's on his way
to the station! Dad's back!

125
00:07:15,625 --> 00:07:17,041
I saw Big One coming in!

126
00:07:17,125 --> 00:07:19,708
But Dad's not due back yet.
Mom told us the schedule.

127
00:07:19,791 --> 00:07:20,541
Let's go see! Come on!

128
00:07:20,625 --> 00:07:21,791
It's against the rules!

129
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:23,458
You can't go into the
station without a pass!

130
00:07:23,541 --> 00:07:24,583
What, are you crazy?

131
00:07:24,666 --> 00:07:26,250
But those are
SDF rules, right?

132
00:07:26,333 --> 00:07:29,083
Well, I'm not
in SDF! So there!

133
00:07:30,541 --> 00:07:31,583
Manabu, wait!

134
00:07:31,666 --> 00:07:33,083
Don't be a
party-pooper!

135
00:07:33,166 --> 00:07:35,791
Dad's here! Tell Mom we'll
be home in a little while!

136
00:07:42,083 --> 00:07:46,458
This is easy enough! Who needs
a pass anyway? Pass Schmass!

137
00:07:58,083 --> 00:08:00,750
[Announcer] Attention:
An SDF train is arriving.

138
00:08:00,833 --> 00:08:03,208
Passengers will disembark
on Platform Three.

139
00:08:18,541 --> 00:08:20,958
What am I
going to do?

140
00:08:47,333 --> 00:08:49,333
[guard-bot]
Intruder alert! Intruder alert!

141
00:08:49,416 --> 00:08:51,333
This threat must
be neutralized!

142
00:08:51,416 --> 00:08:53,166
No! Don't shoot!
Don't shoot!

143
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:55,666
I just came to meet
my Dad! I swear! Huh?

144
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:57,041
[Wataru] Is there a
problem here?

145
00:08:57,125 --> 00:08:59,333
[Guard-bot] We found an
intruder, Sir.

146
00:08:59,416 --> 00:09:03,208
Yes, I see. I'm afraid
he happens to be my son.

147
00:09:04,708 --> 00:09:06,125
[Manabu] Dad!
You're back! I knew it!

148
00:09:06,208 --> 00:09:07,625
You could have
been killed!

149
00:09:08,708 --> 00:09:11,291
What would your Mother
and I do if we lost you?

150
00:09:11,375 --> 00:09:14,250
Come now.
Let's go home.

151
00:09:14,333 --> 00:09:17,250
By the way, how did you
get past the guard-bots?

152
00:09:17,333 --> 00:09:20,583
That's a secret. The SDF
can't know everything, right?

153
00:09:20,666 --> 00:09:22,291
I guess not.

154
00:09:24,333 --> 00:09:26,250
[Manabu] Dad, do you
get to stay a while?

155
00:09:26,333 --> 00:09:27,583
[Wataru] I'm afraid not.

156
00:09:27,666 --> 00:09:29,250
Same as always, huh?

157
00:09:29,333 --> 00:09:30,458
I guess it's
not easy

158
00:09:30,541 --> 00:09:33,375
having a ship's
captain for a dad, is it?

159
00:09:33,458 --> 00:09:35,375
I know how you can
make it up to me!

160
00:09:35,458 --> 00:09:36,375
How's that?

161
00:09:36,458 --> 00:09:38,541
By taking me
aboard Big One.

162
00:09:38,625 --> 00:09:39,875
Sorry, I can't
do that.

163
00:09:39,958 --> 00:09:40,708
Why not?

164
00:09:40,791 --> 00:09:42,208
It's against
the rules.

165
00:09:42,291 --> 00:09:45,583
You have to be an SDF member
to go aboard a space-train.

166
00:09:45,666 --> 00:09:47,125
But that's just it!

167
00:09:47,208 --> 00:09:50,041
I'm not a member of the SDF so
the rules don't apply to me!

168
00:09:50,125 --> 00:09:51,333
Good try.

169
00:09:51,416 --> 00:09:52,916
All right then!
I'll do it!

170
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,083
Do what?

171
00:09:54,166 --> 00:09:57,208
I'll join the SDF!
When I grow up

172
00:09:57,291 --> 00:09:59,833
I'm going to be a captain
in the Space Defense Force,

173
00:09:59,916 --> 00:10:00,666
just like you!

174
00:10:13,666 --> 00:10:15,666
Hey, boy.
How are you?

175
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:17,166
[dog barks]

176
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:19,458
Welcome.
Have a seat.

177
00:10:19,541 --> 00:10:22,291
You didn't know it
was me, did you?

178
00:10:22,375 --> 00:10:23,458
Where have you been?

179
00:10:23,541 --> 00:10:24,833
Your father's going
to hear about this.

180
00:10:24,916 --> 00:10:26,916
He already has.

181
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,041
You look lovely, Kanna.

182
00:10:29,125 --> 00:10:30,916
Wataru, you're back!

183
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,583
You're blushing, Mom!
You're all red!

184
00:10:32,666 --> 00:10:33,500
That's enough, young man!

185
00:10:33,583 --> 00:10:34,583
[Mamoru] Dad! You're back!

186
00:10:34,666 --> 00:10:37,041
Told ya, Mamoru!
That was Big One!

187
00:10:37,125 --> 00:10:38,250
I was right!

188
00:10:38,333 --> 00:10:41,708
Hello, Mamoru. It's
good to see you, Son.

189
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:44,916
You too, Dad. We
really missed you.

190
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,041
I missed you, too.

191
00:10:47,125 --> 00:10:49,750
Remember your promise, Dad? You
said you'd play catch with us!

192
00:10:49,833 --> 00:10:52,250
Remember? The next time
you came in! Remember?

193
00:10:52,333 --> 00:10:55,291
I did say that.
Mamoru, are you ready?

194
00:10:55,375 --> 00:10:56,666
Mmm-hmm!

195
00:10:59,083 --> 00:11:00,333
[Wataru] Nice one!

196
00:11:00,416 --> 00:11:02,625
Now show me that split-finger
fastball, Manabu!

197
00:11:02,708 --> 00:11:04,250
Bring it on!

198
00:11:04,333 --> 00:11:06,083
All right!

199
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:07,833
You asked for it!

200
00:11:09,041 --> 00:11:11,625
Hey! Not bad!
Mamoru! Your turn!

201
00:11:11,708 --> 00:11:15,083
All right Dad! But look out!
I've been practicing!

202
00:11:17,916 --> 00:11:18,875
What's wrong?

203
00:11:20,166 --> 00:11:21,708
Just a little too much
heat for your old man!

204
00:11:21,791 --> 00:11:23,708
Catch it in the web,
not in your palm!

205
00:11:23,791 --> 00:11:25,708
I think I'm the one
who taught you that!

206
00:11:25,791 --> 00:11:27,541
Well, you
obviously forgot!

207
00:11:28,458 --> 00:11:30,041
Well, that's it
for me boys.

208
00:11:30,125 --> 00:11:31,541
[Mamoru]
Aw, come on, Dad!

209
00:11:31,625 --> 00:11:33,916
I have to spend time
with your mother, too.

210
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,083
Ewe! They're going
to get mushy!

211
00:11:36,166 --> 00:11:37,666
They're something
else, aren't they?

212
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:38,833
Mmm-hmm!

213
00:11:38,916 --> 00:11:40,458
They love it
when you're here.

214
00:11:40,541 --> 00:11:43,333
They're both such good boys.
They're growing up fast.

215
00:11:43,416 --> 00:11:44,666
[Kanna] That's for sure.

216
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:46,416
[Manabu]
Full count!

217
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:47,875
Bases are loaded!

218
00:11:49,416 --> 00:11:52,666
Strike three!
He's outta there!

219
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:56,000
Thank you, Kanna.
You're doing such a good job.

220
00:12:00,583 --> 00:12:07,333
[phone ringing]

221
00:12:07,416 --> 00:12:10,666
Wataru Yuuki here.
Yes. I understand.

222
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:12,750
Pick me up
on your way.

223
00:12:12,833 --> 00:12:14,333
You're leaving already?

224
00:12:14,416 --> 00:12:18,166
Sorry, Kanna. Meteorites have
hit a train, and it's stalled.

225
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:21,000
Let's not tell the boys yet.
I'll wait 'til morning.

226
00:12:21,083 --> 00:12:22,666
I'm so sorry, Kanna.

227
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:24,875
It's not your fault.

228
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:26,750
I have something for you.

229
00:12:26,833 --> 00:12:28,125
For me?

230
00:12:28,208 --> 00:12:30,916
It's for your birthday.
I know it's a little early.

231
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:40,916
Oh, Wataru. It's beautiful.
Just come home safely.

232
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:41,875
I will.

233
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:50,625
[Wataru] Good
evening, Bulge.

234
00:12:50,708 --> 00:12:51,583
Captain.

235
00:13:00,041 --> 00:13:01,541
[Mamoru] Hold it.

236
00:13:01,625 --> 00:13:05,291
Just where do you think you're
going? Isn't it a little late?

237
00:13:05,375 --> 00:13:07,416
Please, don't tell!
I'm going to see Dad off!

238
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:08,791
I have to, Mamoru!

239
00:13:08,875 --> 00:13:11,500
Be quiet! You'll
give us away!

240
00:13:13,875 --> 00:13:15,583
Manabu, where
are we going?

241
00:13:15,666 --> 00:13:17,958
To the platform, silly.
Where do you think?

242
00:13:18,041 --> 00:13:20,250
I can't see.
Slow down.

243
00:13:20,333 --> 00:13:21,625
[Wataru] 
Sirius Platoon...

244
00:13:21,708 --> 00:13:24,166
We've been assigned to
rescue a damaged train.

245
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:27,166
The safety of the passengers
is our number one priority.

246
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:28,791
Let's get them back
safe and sound.

247
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:29,708
[All] Yes, Captain!

248
00:13:29,791 --> 00:13:31,250
Begin take-off
sequence now!

Barriers are intact!

[Officer] Atomic Boiler

251
00:13:39,708 --> 00:13:41,291
I must be
out of my mind.

252
00:13:41,375 --> 00:13:43,625
[Manabu] Would you feel
better if we had a pass?

253
00:13:43,708 --> 00:13:44,958
[Mamoru] Yeah!
Do you have one?

254
00:13:45,041 --> 00:13:46,291
[Manabu] No.

255
00:13:46,375 --> 00:13:47,333
Thanks a lot.

256
00:13:47,416 --> 00:13:50,375
Mamoru, over there!
That's Big One!

257
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:56,541
I've never seen it this
close. It's awesome.

258
00:13:56,625 --> 00:13:58,875
I wonder if Dad's
on board already.

259
00:13:58,958 --> 00:14:00,083
He must be.

260

[Guard-bot] Intruder
alert! Intruder alert!

Don't move or
we'll shoot!

Come on!

Awaiting your
command, Sir!

269
00:14:16,666 --> 00:14:18,750
You're gonna have to
leave me behind, Mamoru!

270
00:14:18,833 --> 00:14:19,916
I can't keep
up with you!

271
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,708
[guard-bot] This is
your final warning!

272
00:14:22,791 --> 00:14:23,708
Grab a hold!

273
00:14:23,791 --> 00:14:24,625
[Manabu]
I can't go on!

274
00:14:28,208 --> 00:14:29,333
Full ahead!

275

[Train whistle]

276
00:14:44,333 --> 00:14:45,250
We're dead!

277
00:14:45,333 --> 00:14:46,666
Dad's going to
kill us all right!

278
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:48,500
Maybe we should
jump train.

279
00:14:48,583 --> 00:14:49,833
Are you crazy?

280
00:14:57,583 --> 00:14:59,208
Goodbye, Wataru.

281
00:15:04,958 --> 00:15:06,541
It's so
beautiful!

282
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:14,250
[Wataru] Manabu!
Manabu! Can you hear me?

283
00:15:14,333 --> 00:15:16,583
Wake up, son.
It's me.

284
00:15:18,041 --> 00:15:18,958
[Manabu] Dad?

285
00:15:19,041 --> 00:15:20,083
Yes, Son. I'm here.

286
00:15:20,166 --> 00:15:22,166
Let's get you
back on your feet.

287
00:15:24,916 --> 00:15:27,041
Dad! You're bleeding!
You're hurt!

288
00:15:27,125 --> 00:15:29,541
I'm more worried about Manabu.
Are you all right?

289
00:15:29,625 --> 00:15:31,083
Uh-huh. I feel fine, Dad.

290
00:15:31,166 --> 00:15:34,416
You boys are brave and strong.
I'm proud of you both.

291
00:15:39,666 --> 00:15:41,416
[Bulge] Captain!
They're almost out, Sir!

292
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:43,416
They'll clear the
hole in five minutes!

293
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,000
We can't let that
happen, Bulge!

294
00:15:45,083 --> 00:15:47,916
I understand, Sir.
Captain! You're wounded!

295
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,166
It's nothing.

296
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:51,458
Launch all deep-space
fighters immediately!

297
00:16:21,291 --> 00:16:22,666
All fighters have
been destroyed!

The partition walls
are closed, Captain!

301
00:16:32,333 --> 00:16:35,125
The destroyer will clear
the hole in three minutes!

302
00:16:35,208 --> 00:16:36,833
We've got to
do something!

304
00:16:42,458 --> 00:16:43,875
Divert all power
to the shields!

305

[Bulge] There's not
enough time, Sir!

306
00:16:54,125 --> 00:16:55,208
[The boys] Dad?

307
00:16:55,291 --> 00:16:56,958
Don't worry. It's
going to be all right.

308
00:16:57,041 --> 00:16:59,791
Boys, I'm sending you
back to your mother.

309
00:16:59,875 --> 00:17:01,750
You'll both be
fine, I promise.

310
00:17:01,833 --> 00:17:02,458
For real?

311
00:17:02,541 --> 00:17:03,208
Mmm-hmm.

312
00:17:03,291 --> 00:17:04,791
[Officer]
Captain?

313
00:17:04,875 --> 00:17:06,750
[Wataru] Alright then,
Sirius Platoon.

314
00:17:06,833 --> 00:17:08,708
It's time we
show this enemy

315
00:17:08,791 --> 00:17:10,916
that our true strength
goes beyond guns and steel.

316
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,458
[All] Yes, Captain.

317
00:17:12,541 --> 00:17:14,458
From this moment on I'm placing
the command of this Platoon

318
00:17:14,541 --> 00:17:16,875
in the hands of First
Officer Schwanheld Bulge.

319
00:17:16,958 --> 00:17:18,375
What do you
mean, Captain?

320
00:17:18,458 --> 00:17:21,291
Listen! I want all of you
to move into the Coach Block.

321
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:24,208
I'll use Big One as a decoy
to distract the enemy.

322
00:17:24,291 --> 00:17:26,875
Use auxiliary power to
get yourselves out of here.

323
00:17:26,958 --> 00:17:28,791
Support ships will
be arriving soon.

324
00:17:28,875 --> 00:17:32,666
What about you, Dad? Big
One's no match for that ship!

325
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:34,333
What's going to
happen to you?

326
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,916
Listen, boys. Whether I
make it through this or not,

327
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,666
one thing will
never change.

328
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:44,291
I will always be
your father. Always.

329
00:17:45,458 --> 00:17:48,625
Mamoru, you have no idea
how proud I am of you, son.

330
00:17:51,416 --> 00:17:53,375
Manabu, I'm
counting on you.

331
00:17:53,458 --> 00:17:55,875
Please Son, take care
of your mother for me.

332
00:17:55,958 --> 00:17:58,916
She needs you. You're much
stronger than you realize.

333
00:18:00,916 --> 00:18:03,375
No Dad! Don't do it!
You can't just leave us!

334
00:18:03,458 --> 00:18:04,208
Manabu.

335
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:06,208
Please, Dad.

336
00:18:06,291 --> 00:18:09,666
All of you! Evacuate to
the coach-block immediately!

337
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:13,083
Bulge... This ship is
under your care now.

338
00:18:18,916 --> 00:18:21,666
To our commander and
friend, Captain Yuuki!

339
00:18:23,458 --> 00:18:24,333
Dad! Come back!

340
00:18:27,333 --> 00:18:29,250
Manabu.
I love you.

341
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,625
No, Dad! Don't leave us!
I can't live without you!

342
00:18:36,708 --> 00:18:40,250
Goodbye, my Sons. This
Universe has been my home

343
00:18:40,333 --> 00:18:42,916
but I must leave it
for the Ocean of Spirit.

344
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,833
Be brave, boys. I will
always be with you.

345
00:18:46,916 --> 00:18:52,000
Father.
Father!!

346
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,208
[Computer] The destroyer will
clear the hole in one minute!

347
00:19:11,208 --> 00:19:13,083
All available power
to main battery!

348
00:19:13,166 --> 00:19:14,791
Target enemy
destroyer!

349
00:19:14,875 --> 00:19:17,166
[Computer] Affirmative,
Captain Yuuki.

350
00:19:25,708 --> 00:19:30,125
Kanna. It'll be long this
time, my love. I'm sorry.

351
00:19:33,625 --> 00:19:35,166
Supreme
Commander.

352
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:37,333
Are you really
going, Wataru?

353
00:19:39,666 --> 00:19:41,875
Then I will
escort you.

354
00:19:41,958 --> 00:19:47,416
I am destiny.
I am Shula.

355
00:20:18,458 --> 00:20:19,791
[Bulge] I'm sorry, Kanna.

356
00:20:19,875 --> 00:20:21,958
Wataru was more than
a commander to me.

357
00:20:22,041 --> 00:20:23,708
He was my
best friend.

358
00:20:28,125 --> 00:20:29,166
Hmm?

359
00:20:44,208 --> 00:20:46,875
[Kanna] Mamoru, are you
certain this is what you want?

360
00:20:46,958 --> 00:20:49,500
Yes, Mom. There's
no doubt in my mind.

361
00:20:49,583 --> 00:20:51,375
All right then, Son.

362
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:54,083
Manabu, take care
of Mom for me, okay?

363
00:20:54,166 --> 00:20:55,375
You can
count on me.

364
00:20:55,458 --> 00:20:57,708
I know I can, Manabu.
I know I can.

365
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:02,291
Take care, Mom.
I love you.

366
00:21:02,375 --> 00:21:03,583
I love you too, Son.

367
00:21:04,958 --> 00:21:06,708
[Villager]
There he is!

368
00:21:06,791 --> 00:21:11,041
The next great Yuuki is taking
off! Go Mamoru! Bon voyage!

369
00:21:11,125 --> 00:21:12,416
Bon voyage!
Bon voyage!

370
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:15,541
Well, now. The dream has
become a reality. Take care.

371
00:21:15,625 --> 00:21:18,416
I will, Ooiwa.
Thanks, guys.

372
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:21,125
Gosh. I sure wasn't
expecting all this.

373
00:21:27,416 --> 00:21:31,458
Wait a second. Where's your
pass? All right. Move along.

374
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:37,458
This is it. Once I enter
there's no turning back.

375
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:58,666
Mamoru!

376
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:00,500
Hey! Come
back here!

377
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:03,583
Mamoru it's me!

378
00:22:03,666 --> 00:22:04,625
Mamoru!

379
00:22:04,708 --> 00:22:07,166
Manabu?
Is he crazy?

380
00:22:09,041 --> 00:22:10,500
What are
you doing?

381
00:22:10,583 --> 00:22:13,708
I want to give you something!
Here, Mamoru! Catch!

382
00:22:15,333 --> 00:22:16,916
Bye, Manabu!

383
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,083
Mamoru.

384
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,708
Plagued by visions of
his father's demise

385
00:22:27,791 --> 00:22:30,125
and beset with a
torrent of emotions,

386
00:22:30,208 --> 00:22:32,750
Mamoru Yuuki
courageously set off

387
00:22:32,833 --> 00:22:35,291
on his adventure into
boundless space.

388
00:22:35,375 --> 00:22:38,791
But what lay ahead
was most unexpected.

389
00:22:41,708 --> 00:22:44,708
[phone rings]

390
00:22:44,791 --> 00:22:49,375
[Manabu] Hello! Galaxy Diner!
Yes, she is. Mom! Phone!

391
00:22:49,458 --> 00:22:51,125
Hello?
Kanna speaking.

392
00:22:52,458 --> 00:22:54,208
It can't. No.

393
00:22:56,125 --> 00:22:57,291
[Phone]
Mrs. Yuuki?

394
00:22:58,875 --> 00:23:01,041
Mom! What's the matter? Are
you all right? What happened?

395
00:23:01,125 --> 00:23:03,041
[Phone] Mrs. Yuuki?
Are you still there?

396
00:23:03,125 --> 00:23:04,541
Who is this?

397
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:10,916
[Manabu] Yes, I'm his brother.
What? Mamoru's dead?

398
00:23:23,958 --> 00:23:25,541
On the next Galaxy Railways.

399
00:23:25,625 --> 00:23:28,416
The space train I board slips
into a different time axis

400
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:29,750
and I meet Mamoru

401
00:23:29,833 --> 00:23:31,708
who's supposed to have
been dead for five years.

402
00:23:31,791 --> 00:23:34,208
Our dream of serving in the
SDF together comes to life

403
00:23:34,291 --> 00:23:36,291
but the experience
is bittersweet.

404
00:23:36,375 --> 00:23:38,708
See ya next time
on the Railways.
