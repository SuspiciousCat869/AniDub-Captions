Why won't you take it?

Sandra, we've had
a few disagreements

514
00:19:43,449 --> 00:19:45,818
with you before,
but after all,

you're the one who got us

Yes, and your taxi sink too.

We know it isn't
much money,

least we can offer you.

00:19:58,164 --> 00:20:00,466
Is something wrong
with you people?

I ask for money

You really are
a strange bunch.

It's been years
since I felt useful,

and that's payment enough.

528
00:20:13,512 --> 00:20:15,214
But what about
your cab business?

529
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:17,683
I told you not
to worry about me.
