have to be from
the five species

Good luck there, boys.

59
00:02:15,002 --> 00:02:17,904
Okay, the order we'll
be going in is Golem,

60
00:02:17,904 --> 00:02:19,640
then Mocchi, then Suezo.

61
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,541
And I'll be coaching
them all, of course.

62

Fine.

63

Come on!

64
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:26,113
There's still time
to fit in some training.

65
00:02:26,113 --> 00:02:27,848
Chi!

66
00:02:27,848 --> 00:02:29,750
I wanna fight
in the championship!

67

I insist or I won't budge.

69
00:02:34,888 --> 00:02:37,024
I'll trade places any day.

Now, before we begin
our workout today,

I'd like to call on
your instructor, Tiger,

for a few words.

This is Golem and
Suezo's first match.

Prepare yourselves
'cause I'm a tough trainer.

76

Go!

77

jog to limber us up, everyone.

Huh?
