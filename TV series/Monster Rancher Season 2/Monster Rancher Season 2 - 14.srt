I'm stuck.

330
00:11:59,986 --> 00:12:01,888
How about the teleport?

331
00:12:01,888 --> 00:12:03,890
Oh, yeah, of course.

332
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:06,626
Teleport!

333
00:12:06,626 --> 00:12:08,261
Ta‐da!

334
00:12:08,261 --> 00:12:10,396
And, now...

335
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:11,998
How about a thank‐you kiss?

336
00:12:11,998 --> 00:12:12,932
Come on, Holly.

337
00:12:12,932 --> 00:12:14,667
Shouldn't you be
concentrating more

338
00:12:14,667 --> 00:12:17,470
on getting your ship back
from those ghost Baddies?

339
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:19,906
Oh, yeah, those guys.

340
00:12:19,906 --> 00:12:22,041
Prepare yourselves
for a frontal attack!

341
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:23,176
Yeah!

342
00:12:23,176 --> 00:12:25,812
Wait a minute, if we charge
in there without a plan,

343
00:12:25,812 --> 00:12:27,580
then the same thing
is gonna happen.

344
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:29,415
That's right, if we only knew

345
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:31,517
what their
vulnerable point was.

346
00:12:31,517 --> 00:12:33,086
‐I know.
‐Huh?

347
00:12:33,086 --> 00:12:36,489
I got a plan, and
it just might work.

348
00:12:36,489 --> 00:12:40,260
There's one thing I heard that
conquers ghosts every time,

349
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:41,394
and I can do it.

350
00:12:41,394 --> 00:12:44,063
In fact, all
Suezos can do it.

351
00:12:44,063 --> 00:12:45,632
So tell us what it is!

352
00:12:45,632 --> 00:12:47,800
Hurry up and tell us, chi!

353
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:48,968
You mean your tongue slap?

354
00:12:48,968 --> 00:12:51,170
‐Strike one.
‐Then your tail attack?

355
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:53,373
‐Strike two.
‐How about your teleport?

356
00:12:53,373 --> 00:12:55,141
‐Strike three.
‐Enough suspense.

357
00:12:55,141 --> 00:12:56,809
Just tell us.

358
00:12:56,809 --> 00:12:59,145
Well, you won't believe this,

359
00:12:59,145 --> 00:13:01,781
but I can't remember.

360
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:04,250
Then what was all
that suspense about?

361
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:07,153
I've been trying to jog
my memory, all right?

362
00:13:07,153 --> 00:13:08,821
All righty then.

363
00:13:08,821 --> 00:13:11,157
This'd be a good time
to move on, so let's spy

364
00:13:11,157 --> 00:13:13,459
on those ghost Baddies
then come up with a plan.

365
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:16,162
Put Eyezo and me in
charge of the stakeout.

366
00:13:16,162 --> 00:13:17,930
All right, no fighting.

367
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:19,299
Use teleport, chi.

368
00:13:19,299 --> 00:13:22,168
Suezo, forget about that
plan of yours for now.

369
00:13:22,168 --> 00:13:25,238
Got ya, now how did it go?

370
00:13:25,238 --> 00:13:26,239
Hey, what are you doing?

371
00:13:26,239 --> 00:13:28,374
You're not the greatest
at this teleport thing,

372
00:13:28,374 --> 00:13:30,243
so why don't we
go as a double?

376

Where do you think we landed?

377
00:13:39,686 --> 00:13:41,354
This a pantry or something?

378
00:13:41,354 --> 00:13:42,755
Yeah, it's the
pantry, all right,

379
00:13:42,755 --> 00:13:45,792

much stuff on board before.

Ah‐ha, now I've got it.

this is a pirate ship,

to stop that
horrible singing.

501
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:06,646
How's a singer supposed
to do his warm‐up drills

502
00:19:06,646 --> 00:19:09,115
when Old Yeller's doing
everything to trip him up?

503
00:19:09,115 --> 00:19:11,317
Then couldn't we at
least make it a duet?

504
00:19:11,317 --> 00:19:13,319
Great idea, me swabbie.

505
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:16,255
That's enough!

The ghosts already took
off a long time ago.

getting to the chorus.

Didn't need to
get rude about it.

Well, at least we got rid of

those no‐good
pirate ghost Baddies.

we forgot about something!
