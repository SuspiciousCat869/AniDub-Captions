169

Let's be going.

170

Uh, right.

171
00:07:01,021 --> 00:07:02,789
First of all, let's
go to the stadium

172
00:07:02,789 --> 00:07:04,691
and register our team.

173

You okay, Suezo?

174
00:07:05,859 --> 00:07:09,095
Holly, I don't

177
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,903

championship as well?

178

of the Big Bad Four.

The World Monster Cup

which team will win

next championship.

a sudden‐death match

will be held to
determine the champions.
