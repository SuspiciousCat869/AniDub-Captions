Torble is the biggest city

Look, a restaurant!

Okay, you guys, but don't
order anything expensive.

Yeah, I'll race ya!

Step right up,
boys and girls.

184
00:07:13,233 --> 00:07:14,634
Now I'll admit
this city's hopping

185
00:07:14,634 --> 00:07:16,002
with a lot of
freaky monsters,

186

Go.

188
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:21,041
Now before we start
passing the hat,

189
00:07:21,041 --> 00:07:23,643
let me introduce the
co‐star of our two‐man show,

190
00:07:23,643 --> 00:07:27,681
the monster who helped me
defeat the evil Moo, Golem!

191
00:07:27,681 --> 00:07:28,615
Go!

192
00:07:28,615 --> 00:07:30,216
Okay, enough of him,
now if you will just

193
00:07:30,216 --> 00:07:33,386
cast your eyes back over
this way, I'm Suezo,

194
00:07:33,386 --> 00:07:34,421
and for one gold,

195
00:07:34,421 --> 00:07:36,523
I will autograph anything
that ain't moving.

196
00:07:36,523 --> 00:07:38,358
Form a line now,
who will be first?

197
00:07:38,358 --> 00:07:41,428
He's just another fake
trying to make some money.

198
00:07:41,428 --> 00:07:45,065
(indistinct chattering)

199
00:07:45,065 --> 00:07:47,300
You know, this
place really stinks!

200
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,035
Now how are we gonna
make some money,

201
00:07:49,035 --> 00:07:50,837
not to mention
meet up with Holly?

202
00:07:50,837 --> 00:07:52,772
Golem say we lucky.

203
00:07:52,772 --> 00:07:54,607
‐Huh?
‐We together.

204
00:07:54,607 --> 00:07:56,076
Yeah, come to think of it,

205
00:07:56,076 --> 00:07:58,645
we were lucky to find each
other right after the battle.

206
00:07:58,645 --> 00:08:00,613
We go to Suezo's village now

207
00:08:00,613 --> 00:08:02,415
and look for
others along way.

208
00:08:02,415 --> 00:08:05,952
Mm, Holly might be waiting
there for me even as we speak.

209
00:08:05,952 --> 00:08:09,889
Ooh, and pink Suezo might
have been unlocked as well.

210
00:08:09,889 --> 00:08:12,926
Okay, let's give these guys
a show they won't forget.

211
00:08:12,926 --> 00:08:15,161
Yes, show go on.

212
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:17,497
Step right up,
ladies and monsters!

213
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:20,800
We have right here your
typical green handkerchief,

214
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,603
nothing unusual about
it, as you can see.

215
00:08:23,603 --> 00:08:25,538
But this is magical
handkerchief,

216
00:08:25,538 --> 00:08:27,207
very mysterious.

217
00:08:27,207 --> 00:08:31,077
'Cause when you spread it out
and count to three like this:

218
00:08:31,077 --> 00:08:33,480
One, two, three.

219
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:36,383
Teleport.

220
00:08:36,383 --> 00:08:38,451
Now show up over here.

221
00:08:38,451 --> 00:08:41,154
Yeah, yeah, so he
teleported himself.

222
00:08:41,154 --> 00:08:42,789
They caught on to us.

223
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:45,158
Okay, I know what to do.

224
00:08:45,158 --> 00:08:48,395
‐Great show.
‐Come back, people!

225
00:08:48,395 --> 00:08:50,663
That was only Act One!

226
00:08:50,663 --> 00:08:51,898
Bleh!

228
00:08:54,968 --> 00:08:59,506
This is one lady you don't
want to mess around with.

229
00:08:59,506 --> 00:09:01,541
He's right, I wouldn't
mess around with her

231
00:09:03,643 --> 00:09:06,613
Now I've
transformed into horn.

232

And, finally, the
best of both worlds!

233

Thank you, thank
you very much.

234

fight first?
