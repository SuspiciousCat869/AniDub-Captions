‐Mum Mew: It didn't work.
It still hasn't descended.

27
00:01:10,569 --> 00:01:11,702
Huh?

28
00:01:18,535 --> 00:01:21,435
‐Poison: You'd better fix that
or you'll be in trouble.

29
00:01:21,469 --> 00:01:23,702
Durahan's starting to get edgy.

30
00:01:23,735 --> 00:01:26,435
‐I know that.
‐Gobi: Fixed it.

31
00:01:26,469 --> 00:01:29,302
‐Then let's try it
one more time.

32
00:01:29,335 --> 00:01:33,335
Hear me and awaken,
fierce and powerful soldier
of darkness,

33
00:01:33,369 --> 00:01:34,935
whose strength is unrivaled.

34
00:01:42,702 --> 00:01:45,902
‐(gasps)
Mum Mew, what have you done?

35
00:01:45,935 --> 00:01:47,702
‐(shrieking)
‐Gobi: What?

36
00:01:47,735 --> 00:01:50,202
‐Poison: I told you
never to release that monster.

37
00:01:51,835 --> 00:01:53,835
You've got to stop it.

38
00:01:53,869 --> 00:01:55,535
‐I know that. Gobi!

39
00:01:55,569 --> 00:01:59,902
‐Gobi: I'm trying, I'm trying.
Oh, my aching head.

40
00:02:08,569 --> 00:02:09,802
‐(coughing)

41
00:02:09,835 --> 00:02:11,169
‐Gobi!

42
00:02:12,802 --> 00:02:14,802
‐Phew.
‐Durahan: What's going on?

43
00:02:19,235 --> 00:02:22,235
‐Gobi and Mum Mew:
General Durahan.
‐Hmm.

44
00:02:23,835 --> 00:02:25,302
‐(chuckling)

45
00:02:26,602 --> 00:02:27,835
Oops.

46
00:02:27,869 --> 00:02:29,869
‐Durahan: Hmm.

47
00:02:37,102 --> 00:02:41,569
‐General Durahan, don't worry.
This isn't the crystal ball
with the skull mark on it.

48
00:02:41,602 --> 00:02:42,769
Oh!

49
00:02:42,802 --> 00:02:47,469
‐Durahan: Skull mark?
I expressly told you
to never release that warrior.

50
00:02:47,502 --> 00:02:49,135
‐I'm not part of this charade.

51
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:51,035
I tried to stop her,
but she's stubborn.

52
00:02:51,069 --> 00:02:52,669
‐Durahan:
It's too late for excuses.

53
00:02:52,702 --> 00:02:55,535
Poison, leave us.
I don't want you here
when he is released.

54
00:02:55,569 --> 00:02:58,035
‐Yes, of course, General.
‐Durahan: Move.

55
00:03:09,002 --> 00:03:13,835
‐Shogun: Ah. Durahan,
you thought you had imprisoned
me for all of eternity,

56
00:03:13,869 --> 00:03:17,602
but nothing can stop
Shogun the mighty.

57
00:03:20,469 --> 00:03:23,869
I am prepared
to take you on, Durahan.

58
00:03:23,902 --> 00:03:25,735
‐Durahan: It's been
a long time, Shogun.

59
00:03:25,769 --> 00:03:29,469
‐Shogun: Your body.
Who hath wreaked havoc
on you thus?

60
00:03:29,502 --> 00:03:32,002
‐Durahan: The most powerful
warrior of all.

61
00:03:32,035 --> 00:03:33,135
‐Shogun: Most powerful?

62
00:03:33,169 --> 00:03:37,902
‐Durahan: Yes. Seven veteran
warriors who united and became
a single unstoppable force.

63
00:03:37,935 --> 00:03:39,635
‐Shogun: Seven became one.

64
00:03:44,235 --> 00:03:45,935
Interesting.

65
00:03:45,969 --> 00:03:48,369
‐Durahan: They are the reason
I've resurrected you.

66
00:03:48,402 --> 00:03:52,235
I want you to find the seven
and get my revenge.

67
00:03:53,369 --> 00:03:57,369
‐Shogun: (laughing)
Nothing would give me
more satisfaction.

68
00:03:57,402 --> 00:04:01,969
Those seven warriors will regret
the day they encountered
Shogun the mighty.

69
00:04:02,002 --> 00:04:03,702
(laughing)

70
00:04:07,135 --> 00:04:09,802
‐Poison: Is Shogun
really so terrifying?

71
00:04:09,835 --> 00:04:12,869
‐Durahan: Yes. Especially
with monsters like you,

72
00:04:12,902 --> 00:04:16,169
although Mum Mew
will have nothing
to worry about.

73
00:04:20,402 --> 00:04:21,669
‐Mum Mew: Oh, Shogun.

74
00:04:21,702 --> 00:04:24,235
‐Shogun: Shogun the mighty,
if you please.

75
00:04:24,269 --> 00:04:26,535
‐I still don't get
how you ended up frozen.

76
00:04:26,569 --> 00:04:29,902
If you're so strong,
then why didn't you
show them who was boss

77
00:04:29,935 --> 00:04:32,802
before he had the chance
to freeze ya, hey, Shogun?

78
00:04:32,835 --> 00:04:37,269
‐Shogun: Well, it began the day
I overwhelmed Durahan.

79
00:04:40,635 --> 00:04:42,235
‐Lilim: General Durahan.

80
00:04:43,802 --> 00:04:48,135
‐Shogun: (laughing)
Taste the power of
Shogun the mighty.

81
00:04:48,169 --> 00:04:50,302
I am invincible.

82
00:04:52,369 --> 00:04:54,969
‐Durahan: Run, Lilim.
‐Huh?

83
00:04:55,002 --> 00:04:56,969
‐Shogun: A fair maiden!

84
00:04:58,235 --> 00:04:59,835
‐(shrieks)

85
00:04:59,869 --> 00:05:04,835
‐Shogun: Oh, my dark rose,
your beauty hath bewitched me.

86
00:05:09,102 --> 00:05:10,902
Such beguiling beauty.

87
00:05:12,502 --> 00:05:13,902
(yelling)

88
00:05:19,169 --> 00:05:21,969
‐Mum Mew:
You mean you just slipped
into the ice water?

89
00:05:22,002 --> 00:05:23,269
‐Shogun: Oh, you misunderstand.

90
00:05:23,302 --> 00:05:27,402
Beauty as profound as hers
can serve as the source of
a brave warrior's strength.

91
00:05:27,435 --> 00:05:31,602
‐Oh! So that's why
Durahan sent me.
(chuckling)

92
00:05:33,402 --> 00:05:37,769
Shogun, I'd be honored
to let you use my looks
as a source of inspiration.

93
00:05:39,169 --> 00:05:42,502
‐Shogun: Actually, I said
beauty was what motivated me.

94
00:05:42,535 --> 00:05:45,702
‐Huh? What's that
supposed to mean?
Don't you think I'm beautiful?

95
00:05:45,735 --> 00:05:47,169
I've been known
to turn a few heads.

96
00:05:47,202 --> 00:05:50,135
‐Shogun: (stammering)
I was just saying‐‐

97
00:05:50,169 --> 00:05:51,735
‐(yelling)

98
00:05:56,135 --> 00:05:57,769
‐Both: Shogun!

99
00:05:57,802 --> 00:06:00,969
‐Genki: Whoa!
This weather is something else.

100
00:06:01,002 --> 00:06:02,969
‐Tiger: I love that breeze.

101
00:06:03,002 --> 00:06:04,502
‐Holly: It feels good,
doesn't it?

102
00:06:04,535 --> 00:06:06,469
‐Hare: It makes me
wanna yell to the world...

103
00:06:06,502 --> 00:06:08,235
‐(both yodeling)

104
00:06:08,269 --> 00:06:09,369
‐Chi.

105
00:06:09,402 --> 00:06:10,835
‐Nobody's gonna
answer you here.

106
00:06:10,869 --> 00:06:13,602
That's for in the mountains,
where there's an echo.

107
00:06:13,635 --> 00:06:16,069
‐Shogun: Help me!

108
00:06:16,102 --> 00:06:18,035
‐Mocchi: Someone in river‐chi.

109
00:06:18,069 --> 00:06:19,569
‐Genki.
‐Right.

110
00:06:21,002 --> 00:06:23,202
‐Shogun: Help me.
‐Grab on.

111
00:06:26,169 --> 00:06:29,302
‐Shogun: Much obliged,
gentle maiden.

112
00:06:29,335 --> 00:06:30,369
‐But I didn't do anything.

113
00:06:30,402 --> 00:06:34,535

‐Hare: Never heard of ya.

‐Suezo: You didn't
look too mighty

133
00:07:17,319 --> 00:07:19,052
floundering your way
down the river.

134
00:07:19,086 --> 00:07:22,719
‐He can take down
100 men in a single motion.
‐All: Huh?

135
00:07:22,752 --> 00:07:26,086
‐It's the truth.
Shogun the mighty
is feared by all

136
00:07:26,119 --> 00:07:28,852
and is also known
as Black Lightning.

137
00:07:28,886 --> 00:07:30,419
He's a fierce warrior.

138
00:07:30,452 --> 00:07:32,452
‐I've heard about
Black Lightning as well,

139
00:07:32,486 --> 00:07:33,986
but I thought it was
just a legend.

140
00:07:34,019 --> 00:07:37,419
His stroke's so fast,
his opponents only see
a flash of light.

141
00:07:38,819 --> 00:07:42,086
‐100 men?
All in a single motion?

142
00:07:42,119 --> 00:07:44,819
‐That fast‐chi.
‐Golem: Goh!

143
00:07:44,852 --> 00:07:48,719
‐Shogun: That's a legend.
I can do much better. (laughing)

144
00:07:48,752 --> 00:07:52,319
Boy, you missed a spot.
‐Oh, sorry‐chi.

145
00:07:54,019 --> 00:07:56,852
‐Here you are.
This bowl of stew
should warm you up.

146
00:07:56,886 --> 00:07:59,652
‐Shogun: Your gentle smile
warms this cold heart.

147
00:07:59,686 --> 00:08:01,419
‐I still can't believe
our good luck,

148
00:08:01,452 --> 00:08:05,152
meeting Shogun the mighty
way out here
in the middle of nowhere.

149
00:08:05,186 --> 00:08:08,719
‐Hmm. Shogun, will you train us
how to fight like you do?

150
00:08:08,752 --> 00:08:11,719
‐We try to win
Legend Cup championship‐chi.

151
00:08:11,752 --> 00:08:14,552
‐Shogun: The Legend Cup?
(laughing)

152
00:08:14,586 --> 00:08:16,552
Those contests
are nothing but games,

153
00:08:16,586 --> 00:08:19,519
unlike the heroic duels
fought on the battlefield.

154
00:08:19,552 --> 00:08:22,252
Real battles are the only
true show of strength.

155
00:08:22,286 --> 00:08:25,752
‐That championship
means a lot to us.
Don't knock it.

156
00:08:25,786 --> 00:08:27,719
‐Shogun: I'm simply
telling it like it is.

157
00:08:27,752 --> 00:08:31,019
‐Sure. But throwing
a little respect into the mix
wouldn't hurt.

158
00:08:31,052 --> 00:08:32,086
‐Chi.

159
00:08:32,119 --> 00:08:35,752
‐We wouldn't have
asked you to help train us
if we weren't serious.

160
00:08:35,786 --> 00:08:38,786
‐Golem work very hard.
‐I'm serious about this, too.

161
00:08:38,819 --> 00:08:43,752
‐I am Shogun the mighty.
I have no time
for such futile dawdling.

162
00:08:43,786 --> 00:08:45,519
‐Shogun...

163
00:08:45,552 --> 00:08:50,152
‐Shogun: Then again,
basking in your warm smile
might do a soldier good.

164
00:08:50,186 --> 00:08:51,686
(chuckles)

165
00:08:51,719 --> 00:08:54,252
‐(Mum Mew imitates
Shogun laughing)

166
00:08:55,652 --> 00:08:59,419
Lovestruck fool. Why doesn't
he hurry up and attack them?

167
00:08:59,452 --> 00:09:02,452
‐Wait a minute, Mum Mew.
This might be part of his plan.

168
00:09:02,486 --> 00:09:03,719
‐Mum Mew and Gobi: His plan?

169
00:09:03,752 --> 00:09:05,619
‐Yes, there's seven of them.

170
00:09:05,652 --> 00:09:07,452
So rather than taking them
all at once,

171
00:09:07,486 --> 00:09:10,552
he's befriended them
and he's waiting
for the right moment.

172
00:09:10,586 --> 00:09:13,052
‐Mum Mew: I see.
‐Gobi: Good plan.

173
00:09:13,086 --> 00:09:17,219
‐Shogun: The most important
battle technique
is the hardest to achieve,

174
00:09:17,252 --> 00:09:18,852
mastering one's mind.

175
00:09:18,886 --> 00:09:21,186
‐(all grunting)

176
00:09:21,219 --> 00:09:23,619
‐So, what's the big deal?

177
00:09:23,652 --> 00:09:26,819
‐Shogun: To master your mind,
you must block out
all distractions.

178
00:09:26,852 --> 00:09:27,919
Boo!

179
00:09:27,952 --> 00:09:29,819
‐(all shrieking)

180
00:09:33,386 --> 00:09:35,686
‐Shogun: A scarlet rose,
heaven‐sent.

181
00:09:35,719 --> 00:09:37,419
‐Uh, thanks for catching me.

182
00:09:37,452 --> 00:09:40,019
‐You just staged that
so‐called training maneuver

183
00:09:40,052 --> 00:09:42,019
so Holly would fall
into your arms.

184
00:09:42,052 --> 00:09:45,486
‐Oh, Shogun the mighty
would do no such thing.

185
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:47,852
‐All: Hmm.

186
00:09:49,619 --> 00:09:51,252
‐(Shogun laughing)

187
00:09:54,252 --> 00:09:56,252
(clears throat)
Now, onto the next maneuver.

188
00:09:56,286 --> 00:09:57,686
‐Mum Mew: I don't think
he has any plan.

189
00:09:57,719 --> 00:10:00,219
He's just trying
to get to know that girl.

190
00:10:00,252 --> 00:10:02,652
‐(all grunting)

191
00:10:11,219 --> 00:10:13,119
‐Tiger: Huh?
‐All: Huh?

192
00:10:16,552 --> 00:10:18,452
‐That Zuum stole my bag.

193
00:10:18,486 --> 00:10:22,686
‐Catch him!
‐No, Holly, stay here with me.

194
00:10:22,719 --> 00:10:25,152
‐Gobi: Halt.
‐Huh? How dare you!

195
00:10:27,419 --> 00:10:28,852
Oh.

196
00:10:28,886 --> 00:10:31,586
What? They are the ones
I'm after?

197
00:10:32,786 --> 00:10:35,119
You mean‐‐
‐Gobi: Uh‐huh. Uh‐huh.

198
00:10:35,152 --> 00:10:36,352
‐Shogun: Hmm.

199
00:10:41,886 --> 00:10:43,052
Very sly indeed.

200
00:10:43,086 --> 00:10:45,886
But there's no fooling
Shogun the mighty.

201
00:10:45,919 --> 00:10:48,086
I knew what they were up to
the minute I saw them.

202
00:10:48,119 --> 00:10:49,819
‐You did not know!

203
00:10:49,852 --> 00:10:53,352
‐(yells) How dare they
take advantage of my goodwill?

204
00:10:53,386 --> 00:10:57,486
They will regret it.
Shogun the mighty will
teach them a lesson!

205
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:00,086
‐Tiger: That Zuum
will think twice next time
he tries to steal something.

206
00:11:00,119 --> 00:11:01,952
‐Holly: Maybe we were
too hard on him.

207
00:11:01,986 --> 00:11:04,586
‐He's gotta learn that
crime just doesn't pay.

208
00:11:04,619 --> 00:11:06,052
‐Stealing no good.

209
00:11:06,086 --> 00:11:09,719
‐(groaning) Please help me,
Mum Mew.

210
00:11:10,786 --> 00:11:13,052
‐Huh? Where's Shogun?

211
00:11:13,086 --> 00:11:16,086
‐Mocchi: Not here‐chi.
‐Hare: He took off on us!

212
00:11:16,119 --> 00:11:19,086
‐Talk about nerve. You'd think
he could've said goodbye first.

213
00:11:19,119 --> 00:11:22,319
‐I was hoping
he could stick around
and train us some more.

214
00:11:22,352 --> 00:11:24,719
‐Yeah. Me, too.

215
00:11:24,752 --> 00:11:26,619
‐Wait. I can sense him nearby.

216
00:11:28,319 --> 00:11:33,652
‐Shogun: So, you are
the seven veteran warriors
united as a single force.

217
00:11:33,686 --> 00:11:37,052
‐What do you mean,
"seven veteran warriors
united as one"?

218
00:11:37,086 --> 00:11:38,252
‐Never heard of 'em.

219
00:11:38,286 --> 00:11:42,619
‐And on that note,
why don't we drop the subject
and get back to our training?

220
00:11:42,652 --> 00:11:45,552
‐(laughing) I have discovered
your true identity

221
00:11:45,586 --> 00:11:47,619
and I challenge you
to a duel.

222
00:11:47,652 --> 00:11:48,919
‐Challenge us‐chi?

223
00:11:48,952 --> 00:11:51,786
‐What do you want to
fight us for, Shogun?
We are your friends.

224
00:11:51,819 --> 00:11:54,552
‐We just wanna train with you.
We're not looking
for any battles.

225
00:11:54,586 --> 00:11:57,352
‐Shogun: You tried to steal
my invincible battle techniques.

226
00:11:57,386 --> 00:12:00,086
Cowards! Now, transform
into your monster shape

227
00:12:00,119 --> 00:12:01,619
and fight me fair and square.

228
00:12:01,652 --> 00:12:02,752
‐All: "Monster shape"?

229
00:12:02,786 --> 00:12:04,652
‐How long will you
keep up this act?

230
00:12:04,686 --> 00:12:07,086
Fine, then I'll make
the first move.

231
00:12:07,119 --> 00:12:08,986
‐Shogun‐‐
‐Don't bother.

232
00:12:09,019 --> 00:12:10,152
‐Suezo: I think he's serious.

233
00:12:10,186 --> 00:12:14,086
‐Prepare for a taste
of my lightning sword.

234
00:12:14,119 --> 00:12:15,519
‐Wait. Don't do it.

235
00:12:27,252 --> 00:12:29,286
‐Shogun: (chuckles awkwardly)
I‐‐

236
00:12:32,319 --> 00:12:35,519
Oh, seven‐in‐one warrior,
only the greatest soldiers

237
00:12:35,552 --> 00:12:37,152
have ever stopped
my lightning sword.

238
00:12:37,186 --> 00:12:39,786
‐What's this "seven‐in‐one
warrior" stuff anyway?

239
00:12:39,819 --> 00:12:42,986
‐Stop feigning innocence!
Ring of steel!

240
00:12:45,686 --> 00:12:48,386
Oh, it must have been weakened
from the years in ice.

241
00:12:48,419 --> 00:12:51,552
Well, a broken sword
isn't enough to stop
Shogun the mighty.

242
00:12:57,086 --> 00:12:58,519
(panting)

243
00:12:59,819 --> 00:13:02,086
Strange, how easily
you avoided my sword.

244
00:13:02,119 --> 00:13:04,886
‐It wasn't that hard,
seeing as it's only
a foot long.

245
00:13:04,919 --> 00:13:06,986
‐Shogun,
what's gotten into you?

246
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:08,886
‐Shogun: Enough idle chatter!

247
00:13:08,919 --> 00:13:10,486
‐Stumble Samurai.

248
00:13:13,886 --> 00:13:15,986
‐Huh? Tiger!

249
00:13:16,019 --> 00:13:17,986
‐Words won't get through to him.

250
00:13:18,019 --> 00:13:19,919
‐(Shogun laughing)
‐All: Huh?

251
00:13:19,952 --> 00:13:23,952
‐Seven‐in‐one warrior,
at last you have
revealed yourself.

252
00:13:23,986 --> 00:13:26,352
The duel has just begun.

253
00:13:26,386 --> 00:13:29,786
Prepare for my
whirlwind attack!

254
00:13:32,986 --> 00:13:34,186
‐Are you okay?

255
00:13:34,219 --> 00:13:38,686
‐(groaning) My reputation,
it falls into disrepair.

256
00:13:38,719 --> 00:13:40,186
How utterly frustrating.

257
00:13:40,219 --> 00:13:41,919
‐He's pathetic.

258
00:13:41,952 --> 00:13:43,719
‐All: Shogun?

259
00:13:43,752 --> 00:13:45,252
‐Shogun: Unhand me.

260
00:13:45,286 --> 00:13:47,586
A great soldier knows
when to admit defeat.

261
00:13:47,619 --> 00:13:50,452
But you can never destroy
my pride.

262
00:13:50,486 --> 00:13:53,986
‐Get a grip, Shogun.
‐Quit acting weird!
Now, get up!

263
00:13:54,019 --> 00:13:55,986
‐Shogun the mighty, my foot.

264
00:13:56,019 --> 00:13:58,919
Zuums, just forget Shogun
and go after them yourselves.

265
00:14:01,352 --> 00:14:03,152
‐Mocchi: Baddies‐chi.

266
00:14:03,186 --> 00:14:05,719
‐Golem, you stay here
and protect Holly and Shogun.

267
00:14:05,752 --> 00:14:07,019
‐Golem: Goh.

268
00:14:11,319 --> 00:14:13,686
‐Tiger: Lightning attack!

269
00:14:13,719 --> 00:14:15,686
‐Double pounder!
Double pounder!
Double pounder!

270
00:14:15,719 --> 00:14:17,652
‐Tongue slap!

271
00:14:22,986 --> 00:14:26,286
‐They've outnumbered us.
‐They just keep on coming.

272
00:14:26,319 --> 00:14:28,519
‐Let's bolt till we have a plan.
‐All: Yeah!

273
00:14:30,819 --> 00:14:32,819
‐Shogun: Unhand me, you brute.

274
00:14:32,852 --> 00:14:34,119
‐After them!

275
00:14:44,222 --> 00:14:47,356
What? You still
haven't found them?

276
00:14:51,922 --> 00:14:54,322
‐Is the coast clear?
‐Bad news‐chi.

277
00:14:54,356 --> 00:14:56,122
‐They've got us
completely surrounded.

278
00:14:56,156 --> 00:14:58,822
‐Then we'll have to sit tight
and try waiting them out.

279
00:14:58,856 --> 00:15:01,856
Tiger should be back
fairly soon.
‐Genki: Hmm.

280
00:15:03,122 --> 00:15:05,056
Any progress?
‐Mmm‐mmm.

281
00:15:05,089 --> 00:15:06,922
‐Stubborn man here won't budge.

282
00:15:06,956 --> 00:15:08,622
‐End the duel
and have your victory.

283
00:15:08,656 --> 00:15:11,256
‐Come on, Shogun,
it was a one‐way fight
in the first place.

284
00:15:11,289 --> 00:15:14,156
‐Shogun: A duel is a battle
for one's integrity and pride.

285
00:15:14,189 --> 00:15:18,756
No, take your victory
and let me proceed down the road
of failure and ridicule.

286
00:15:18,789 --> 00:15:21,289
‐Even if you did lose,
that's no reason to give up.

287
00:15:21,322 --> 00:15:23,322
You can always train
and have another duel.

288
00:15:23,356 --> 00:15:27,089
‐Shogun: Black Lightning
being retrained like
a mere apprentice?

289
00:15:27,122 --> 00:15:30,456
(scoffs) Such an undignified act
I could not commit.

290
00:15:33,889 --> 00:15:36,756
‐So what if it's undignified?
‐Shogun: Hmm?

291
00:15:36,789 --> 00:15:38,789
‐You might not agree,

292
00:15:38,822 --> 00:15:42,022
but to me, what matters
is having the courage
to never give up.

293
00:15:42,056 --> 00:15:43,722
That's more important
than winning.

294
00:15:46,922 --> 00:15:48,022
‐(Shogun chuckles)

295
00:15:49,089 --> 00:15:50,822
What do you know about it?

296
00:15:50,856 --> 00:15:53,422
You don't understand
what it means to be known

297
00:15:53,456 --> 00:15:55,889
as the mightiest warrior
in the land.

298
00:15:56,989 --> 00:15:58,089
‐I'm sorry.

299
00:16:00,189 --> 00:16:02,189
‐Huh? What did you find out?

300
00:16:02,222 --> 00:16:04,356
‐There's a rocky stretch
not far up ahead.

301
00:16:04,389 --> 00:16:06,689
I think we can lose them
once we get past it.

302
00:16:06,722 --> 00:16:08,856
‐Well, then let's make
a run for it.

303
00:16:08,889 --> 00:16:10,256
‐Holly: Yeah.
‐Chi!

304
00:16:10,289 --> 00:16:12,256
‐Well, shall we go?

305
00:16:12,289 --> 00:16:15,656
Huh?
‐Shogun: Go on without me.

306
00:16:15,689 --> 00:16:17,189
‐But Shogun‐‐

307
00:16:17,222 --> 00:16:19,322
‐You heard what the man said.
Let's leave him.

308
00:16:19,356 --> 00:16:22,256
‐We can't.
‐It's us the Baddies are after,
not Shogun,

309
00:16:22,289 --> 00:16:24,189
so there's no sense
worrying about him.

310
00:16:26,222 --> 00:16:28,989
‐Let's get going.
‐Uh, yeah. Sure.

311
00:16:40,956 --> 00:16:44,389
What matters is having
the courage to never give up.

312
00:16:44,422 --> 00:16:46,689
That's more important
than winning.

313
00:16:48,122 --> 00:16:50,756
‐Shogun: 9,995.

314
00:16:50,789 --> 00:16:53,056
9,996.

315
00:16:54,356 --> 00:16:57,456
9,997.

316
00:16:57,489 --> 00:16:59,889
9,998.

317
00:17:01,189 --> 00:17:04,022
9,999.

318
00:17:04,056 --> 00:17:06,189
(groaning)

319
00:17:15,289 --> 00:17:17,522
10,001.

320
00:17:18,722 --> 00:17:20,922
10,002.

321
00:17:20,956 --> 00:17:22,322
10,003.

322
00:17:25,922 --> 00:17:29,389
Now I have the true spirit
of a warrior.

323
00:17:31,956 --> 00:17:33,556
‐Zuum: That way.

324
00:17:36,089 --> 00:17:39,122
‐Genki: It's a dead end.
‐(Mum Mew laughing)

325
00:17:40,789 --> 00:17:43,589
This time, you won't
get away, I'm afraid.

326
00:17:43,622 --> 00:17:46,622
It is only seven of you,
after all.

327
00:17:46,656 --> 00:17:49,322
We should have done things
this way from the start

328
00:17:49,356 --> 00:17:51,889
rather than counting on Shogun.
‐Gobi: Yeah.

329
00:17:51,922 --> 00:17:53,822
‐Huh?
What are you talking about?

330
00:17:53,856 --> 00:17:56,289
‐I heard the legends
of Shogun the mighty,

331
00:17:56,322 --> 00:17:59,056
so I gave him orders
to defeat you
and your friends,

332
00:17:59,089 --> 00:18:02,522
but unfortunately,
he turned out to be weaker
than I thought.

333
00:18:02,556 --> 00:18:03,922
‐So you sent him after us.

334
00:18:03,956 --> 00:18:05,922
‐(laughs)

335
00:18:05,956 --> 00:18:10,356
I have to say, it was nice
working with a monster
who was so gullible.

336
00:18:10,389 --> 00:18:12,756
‐You're despicable.
‐You mean‐chi.

337
00:18:12,789 --> 00:18:14,456
‐Sticks and stones, my friends.

338
00:18:14,489 --> 00:18:17,656
Now, how about handing over
that Mystery Disk?

339
00:18:18,956 --> 00:18:23,422
A long wait, but at last
the evil soul will be back
in our hands.

340
00:18:23,456 --> 00:18:28,922
And with it, the greatest power
and the key to allow the Baddies
to reign supreme!

341
00:18:28,956 --> 00:18:32,156
(laughing)
‐Shogun: So that was
your true motive.

342
00:18:33,389 --> 00:18:36,356
You still rely
on Moo's evil power,

343
00:18:36,389 --> 00:18:41,089
but the only invincible power
comes from within
after much training.

344
00:18:41,122 --> 00:18:42,756
Witness it firsthand!

345
00:18:42,789 --> 00:18:45,322
‐All: Shogun!
‐(laughing)

346
00:18:45,356 --> 00:18:47,456
Lookout, everyone,
he's got a big stick.

347
00:19:04,156 --> 00:19:05,389
After him!

348
00:19:10,456 --> 00:19:11,722
‐Shogun!

349
00:19:33,489 --> 00:19:36,389
‐The legendary
lightning flash technique.

350
00:19:36,422 --> 00:19:38,556
‐Whoa! I don't believe it!

351
00:19:38,589 --> 00:19:40,189
‐(Mum Mew whimpering)

352
00:19:45,389 --> 00:19:46,722
‐All: Shogun!

353
00:19:48,822 --> 00:19:49,889
‐(Shogun laughing)

354
00:19:51,156 --> 00:19:52,656
‐Genki: Thanks for
all your help, Shogun.

355
00:19:52,689 --> 00:19:55,356
‐Shogun: It is I who owes
a debt of gratitude.

356
00:19:55,389 --> 00:19:58,256
You made me remember
something very important.

357
00:19:58,289 --> 00:20:00,022
‐What's so important‐chi?

358
00:20:00,056 --> 00:20:04,256
‐To have passion and conviction,
and to never give up
on your dreams.

359
00:20:04,289 --> 00:20:05,989
‐Shogun.

360
00:20:06,022 --> 00:20:09,056
‐Shogun: Today,
I will train myself anew.

361
00:20:09,089 --> 00:20:12,922
And good luck to you
in the Legend Cup.
‐Mocchi: Chi.

362
00:20:12,956 --> 00:20:16,022
‐Shogun: I hope to challenge you
to another duel someday.

363
00:20:16,056 --> 00:20:20,756
Then, you must transform
yourselves and show me your
seven‐in‐one warrior techniques.

364
00:20:20,789 --> 00:20:22,256
‐All: Transform ourselves?

365
00:20:22,289 --> 00:20:25,789
‐Shogun: Farewell,
seven fierce warriors
who fight as one.

366
00:20:27,122 --> 00:20:29,222
‐Wait, Shogun.

367
00:20:29,256 --> 00:20:31,556
‐I think he's got us
mixed up with someone else.

368
00:20:31,589 --> 00:20:35,222
‐Yeah. But, hey, don't you think
it kind of suits us?

369
00:20:35,256 --> 00:20:36,856
‐We're veterans of many battles.

370
00:20:36,889 --> 00:20:39,222
Seven soldiers
who fight together as one.

371
00:20:39,256 --> 00:20:40,822
‐Genki: Hmm.
‐Yeah.

372
00:20:40,856 --> 00:20:43,756
‐Shogun, here's to making
dreams come true.
