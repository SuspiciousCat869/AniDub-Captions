1
00:00:05,466 --> 00:00:09,466
[Shido] This tainted world
is about to perish
because of its sin.

2
00:00:10,466 --> 00:00:13,566
However, that's not the
case with you!

3
00:00:13,666 --> 00:00:17,933
You, who are still young,
are unspoiled and untainted.

4
00:00:18,033 --> 00:00:20,400
You're the angels that
will bear the new world!

5
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:23,266
And of course I'm just a
blemished adult,

6
00:00:23,366 --> 00:00:25,133
who's nothing like you.

7
00:00:25,233 --> 00:00:29,733
I've sinned, lived in such
darkness. I...

8
00:00:29,833 --> 00:00:34,533
I'm hoping to cleanse all the
sins that I've committed by
being with you!

9
00:00:34,633 --> 00:00:37,533
[Shido] Everyone, please show
me the way!

10
00:00:37,633 --> 00:00:41,633
And let me see the new world
that lies behind this chaos!

11
00:00:41,733 --> 00:00:44,900
Your tender touch can redeem me!

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,733
Help me, Mr. Shido! Let me in!

13
00:00:47,833 --> 00:00:49,800
I'll never
talk back to you again!

14
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:51,900
Please help me!

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,033
[Shido] Now, let's put our
hearts together!
[Boy] Let me in!

16
00:00:56,666 --> 00:00:57,900
[applause]

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,466
[boy screaming]

18
00:02:37,033 --> 00:02:41,200
[Saya] How many times do I
have to tell you this to
get you to understand?!

19
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:44,966
"Killing pandemic"?
That's complete bullshit!

20
00:02:45,066 --> 00:02:48,166
The government is using it
as an excuse for failing
to figure out

21
00:02:48,266 --> 00:02:50,333
why dead bodies have been
attacking people!

22
00:02:50,433 --> 00:02:53,066
You're saying you believe all
these people are actually dead?

23
00:02:53,166 --> 00:02:54,700
Don't be ridiculous!

24
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,766
[man] It has to be some kind of
disease! Some kind of infection.

25
00:02:57,866 --> 00:03:01,000
That's right! There's no way
this could be happening
without a reason!

26
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:02,566
Well of course there's a reason!

27
00:03:02,666 --> 00:03:05,100
But none of us around here are
going to find it out!

28
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,933
Unless by some chance you're
a Pulitzer Prize winning
research scientist

29
00:03:09,033 --> 00:03:10,200
with access to a lab!

30
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:12,200
And even if you are,
you think any of us

31
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:15,433
have time to wait until your
research is completed?

32
00:03:15,533 --> 00:03:16,800
Well, that's just...

33
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:20,166
[Saya] We have to concentrate
on surviving, that's all!

34
00:03:20,266 --> 00:03:21,833
Try not to get eaten!

35
00:03:21,933 --> 00:03:24,200
I can't believe this
mob incompetence!

36
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:28,133
Did you not listen to a word
my father said?

37
00:03:33,733 --> 00:03:35,066
I see...

38
00:03:35,166 --> 00:03:37,066
That's the point you really
want to make, isn't it?

39
00:03:37,166 --> 00:03:41,200
I was wondering why high school
kids were flashing guns like
they were cops, but...

40
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:42,300
Huh?

41
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,366
[lady] After all,
that's what you're after!

42
00:03:44,466 --> 00:03:46,933
You're just saying that you're
going to protect us!

43
00:03:47,033 --> 00:03:51,500
People out here are trying
to control us with violence!
Violence!

44
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:56,066
How dare you when there are
so many people suffering
in other Asian countries?!

45
00:03:56,166 --> 00:03:58,400
What the hell does global
suffering have to do with it?

46
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:01,000
Just you listen to me,
everybody!

47
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:03,233
The one, who's telling us
to be murderers...

48
00:04:03,333 --> 00:04:05,566
No, who's forcing us
to be murderers,

49
00:04:05,666 --> 00:04:08,600
is that man's daughter,
who says "yes" to killing!

50
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:12,100
I'm sorry, but what the hell
are you talking about, lady?

51
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:14,066
[man] You're just a bunch
of kids! Shut up!

52
00:04:14,166 --> 00:04:15,500
Fuck you, asshole!

53
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,933
We have just as much say as
you do in this bullshit!

54
00:04:18,033 --> 00:04:19,166
Nonsense!

55
00:04:19,266 --> 00:04:21,733
Adults are making decisions
from now on!

56
00:04:21,833 --> 00:04:23,866
Not those pigs
of exploited classes,

57
00:04:23,966 --> 00:04:28,833
or some high school kids
who are intoxicated by
their violent power!

58
00:04:28,933 --> 00:04:30,566
[group] That's right! Yeah!

59
00:04:30,666 --> 00:04:34,500
[lady] We absolutely repudiate
violent dominance!

60
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,600
[group] We repudiate it!

61
00:04:38,133 --> 00:04:40,833
[Kota] That was a really
good job, Takagi.

62
00:04:40,933 --> 00:04:42,500
She's a Nazi!

63
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:45,633
I talked to her only because
she was talking bad
about my father,

64
00:04:45,733 --> 00:04:47,366
but it was pointless!

65
00:04:47,466 --> 00:04:48,533
Are they crazy?

66
00:04:48,633 --> 00:04:50,866
Have they seen
what's happening out there?

67
00:04:50,966 --> 00:04:53,133
That crowd doesn't see anything!

68
00:04:53,233 --> 00:04:55,666
I don't know. I can kind of
understand how they feel.

69
00:04:55,766 --> 00:04:58,466
Are you trying to pick a fight
with me, ya fat ass?

70
00:04:58,566 --> 00:05:01,333
[Kota] Wait, wait!
That's not what I'm doing!

71
00:05:01,433 --> 00:05:05,666
You know, people have a tendency
to ignore what they don't
want to see.

72
00:05:10,866 --> 00:05:13,200
No one wants to be denied.

73
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:15,200
That's why most of the people
wouldn't do anything

74
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:18,600
even though they know
something is happening.

75
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:20,266
It's just human nature.

76
00:05:20,366 --> 00:05:22,100
You can't deny the fact that
there's a shift happening

77
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,433
in this defacto
survivor colony.

78
00:05:24,533 --> 00:05:26,433
Well, yeah, but I...

79
00:05:26,533 --> 00:05:30,466
I think that in that kind
of situation, most people...

80
00:05:30,566 --> 00:05:34,633
their first reaction is
to deny it. Ignore it.

81
00:05:34,733 --> 00:05:38,333
They don't face reality
because it's too much
for them to handle.

82
00:05:39,566 --> 00:05:40,400
Understand?

83
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,133
If they don't admit
to the change,

84
00:05:42,233 --> 00:05:46,133
then they don't have to admit
their mistakes or idiocy.

85
00:05:46,233 --> 00:05:48,133
[Kota] Well of course!

86
00:05:48,233 --> 00:05:50,566
Ignoring our mistakes
and humiliations,

87
00:05:50,666 --> 00:05:53,966
how do you think we get
through high school?

88
00:05:54,066 --> 00:05:56,766
VeryBreakfast Clubof you,
chubby.

89
00:05:56,866 --> 00:05:57,766
[Takashi] I see...

90
00:05:57,866 --> 00:05:58,766
See what?

91
00:05:58,866 --> 00:06:01,200
Well, that was informative.

92
00:06:05,266 --> 00:06:07,033
What? What is it?

93
00:06:07,133 --> 00:06:08,300
You don't do that.

94
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,733
What are you talking about?

95
00:06:09,833 --> 00:06:12,900
This is embarrassing,
but I'm still admitting to it.

96
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,366
See? Don't you think this
makes him the one?

97
00:06:15,466 --> 00:06:17,466
Right, Takashi's kind
of different.

98
00:06:17,566 --> 00:06:19,900
Hey, what are you guys
talking about?

99
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,766
[Saya] Don't you see?

100
00:06:21,866 --> 00:06:23,233
You're the obvious choice.

101
00:06:23,333 --> 00:06:26,633
If any of us, you're the one
who should be our leader.

102
00:06:27,333 --> 00:06:29,100
What?

103
00:06:41,833 --> 00:06:43,533
What do you think it is?

104
00:06:43,633 --> 00:06:46,633
[Soichiro] I've heard the rumor
that Master Busujima believes

105
00:06:46,733 --> 00:06:48,500
his daughter is the sword user

106
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:53,000
and that the daughter is every
bit as skilled as Sanako Chiba.

107
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:57,200
Pure and graceful,
that daughter must be you.

108
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:01,500
Go ahead, touch it.
You will not stain its power.

109
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:08,100
What is this?

110
00:07:10,166 --> 00:07:12,166
This is an extremely rare sword.

111
00:07:12,266 --> 00:07:14,200
[Soichiro] Do you see it?

112
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:16,400
[Saeko]
It's only slightly curved.

113
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:19,233
This is a double‐edged
Kissaki‐Moroha.

114
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,866
Shoju Kanemasa...

115
00:07:23,966 --> 00:07:26,666
I think this is the
Murata Sword.

116
00:07:26,766 --> 00:07:29,500
Impressive, I was right.

117
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,700
It was the Meiji Era,

118
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:34,266
Major General Murata,
known for the Murata rifle,

119
00:07:34,366 --> 00:07:38,000
had it forged at
Tokyo Artillery Factory.

120
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:40,566
Supposedly, he slashed
a pig's skull in two,

121
00:07:40,666 --> 00:07:44,300
but it didn't leave a single
scratch on the blade.

122
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,300
[Saeko]
It was the width of the blade.

123
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,600
[Soirchiro] Now it is yours.

124
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:56,100
[Saeko] Sir, I must say
with all due respect,

125
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:59,066
I can't accept it without
a legitimate reason.

126
00:07:59,166 --> 00:08:02,766
I've once received the training
from Master Busujima.

127
00:08:02,866 --> 00:08:06,766
Will you accept it as the token
of my gratitude for that?

128
00:08:06,866 --> 00:08:10,600
Then, I think it'd be best
for you to give it to my
father yourself.

129
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:18,633
I would expect nothing less from
the Master's daughter.

130
00:08:18,733 --> 00:08:21,100
You're strikingly honest.

131
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:24,800
Please forgive me, I meant
no disrespect to you, Master.

132
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:26,566
I'm sure you know this,

133
00:08:26,666 --> 00:08:29,866
but my daughter still has
much to learn.

134
00:08:29,966 --> 00:08:31,333
Maybe so, sir.

135
00:08:31,433 --> 00:08:34,133
And it is true that I did
save her life at one point,

136
00:08:34,233 --> 00:08:38,500
but she was my salvation
in some ways as well.

137
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:42,266
If you really want to
ensure that your daughter's
protected at all costs,

138
00:08:42,366 --> 00:08:44,866
why would you not simply
keep her by your side?

139
00:08:44,966 --> 00:08:49,166
The daughter of the Takagi
family has the highest respect
for her parents

140
00:08:49,266 --> 00:08:51,333
and loves them very deeply.

141
00:08:51,433 --> 00:08:54,033
They say that parents and
children are alike.

142
00:08:54,133 --> 00:08:59,600
Or instead of me,
perhaps you could, uh...

143
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:01,133
give it to Takashi.

144
00:09:01,233 --> 00:09:02,900
He's quite deserving.

145
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,200
I've known him ever since
he was little.

146
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:07,466
He's grown to be a
fine young man,

147
00:09:07,566 --> 00:09:12,233
and how much you appear to
trust him proves my appraisal
is correct.

148
00:09:12,833 --> 00:09:14,633
However...

149
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:19,766
To me, he appears to be
still hesitating.

150
00:09:22,033 --> 00:09:27,166
This new world has no place
for a leader who tends
towards hesitation.

151
00:09:30,966 --> 00:09:32,900
I know they say I'm the
leader, but...

152
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,533
[door opening]

153
00:09:34,633 --> 00:09:36,600
[Rei] Aren't you?

154
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,666
[Takashi] Rei, are you okay?

155
00:09:40,766 --> 00:09:43,900
You're gonna mess your back up
even more if you push it.

156
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,533
[Rei]
We've all been relying on you.

157
00:09:45,633 --> 00:09:48,833
You were brave,
even at the school too.

158
00:09:48,933 --> 00:09:51,266
And other times also.
You're a natural.

159
00:09:51,366 --> 00:09:53,766
Are you kidding?
I was just desperate.

160
00:09:53,866 --> 00:09:56,966
I wasn't trying to be a leader.

161
00:09:57,066 --> 00:10:01,000
[Takashi]
And the stronger fighters we had
were Saeko and Hirano.

162
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:03,100
And you too.

163
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:06,200
And Saya, she's the smart one.

164
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:08,733
Miss Shizuka is a doctor,

165
00:10:08,833 --> 00:10:10,033
and Arisu is...

166
00:10:10,133 --> 00:10:12,033
And she is...

167
00:10:12,133 --> 00:10:13,800
[Takashi] Arisu is Arisu!

168
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:15,566
I guess.

169
00:10:18,666 --> 00:10:20,700
Don't laugh at me!

170
00:10:26,166 --> 00:10:27,433
[Rei] Takashi...

171
00:10:27,533 --> 00:10:29,200
[Takashi] What?

172
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:32,266
[Saya] I'll tell you one of
the girls' rules.

173
00:10:37,433 --> 00:10:41,633
We like cute boys and
the boys who are sweet to us.

174
00:10:41,733 --> 00:10:43,400
[Takashi] Is that all?

175
00:10:44,066 --> 00:10:46,433
[Rei] Yup, that's all.

176
00:10:46,533 --> 00:10:49,200
How can anything else be
important other than that?

177
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:51,700
[Takashi]
I'm not either of them.

178
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,833
Maybe you weren't before.

179
00:10:53,933 --> 00:10:56,033
Yeah, I admit it.

180
00:10:56,133 --> 00:10:58,566
But you're different now.

181
00:10:58,666 --> 00:11:02,766
[Rei] You might come off as
so despondent, even hopeless.

182
00:11:02,866 --> 00:11:06,766
But when it comes down to it,
you're always up for a fight.

183
00:11:06,866 --> 00:11:12,100
Maybe you think it's something
involuntary that you don't
have a choice.

184
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:14,233
But I think you're a fighter.

185
00:11:14,333 --> 00:11:17,400
Maybe you weren't
always that way.

186
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:20,166
But I believe you're
that way now.

187
00:11:20,266 --> 00:11:23,133
I didn't really see it before.

188
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:26,000
I made a terrible mistake.

189
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:27,500
I shouldn't have hurt you!

190
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:31,833
[Rei] I should never have
broken up with you!

191
00:11:31,933 --> 00:11:36,066
I love you and I understand if
you don't feel the same way,

192
00:11:36,166 --> 00:11:39,700
but trust me, I'll never hurt
you again! I swear it!

193
00:11:46,866 --> 00:11:49,433
[Rei] What's the matter?

194
00:11:49,533 --> 00:11:51,166
[Takashi] I don't know if I
should kiss you right now

195
00:11:51,266 --> 00:11:53,300
or smack the hell out of you.

196
00:11:54,366 --> 00:11:57,766
And I don't know
if you're being honest.

197
00:12:00,633 --> 00:12:04,733
I don't know how else to be
with you right now.

198
00:12:17,666 --> 00:12:20,500
I'm sorry, I know it hurts.

199
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,700
You should lie down.

200
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,333
You don't know
how much it hurts.

201
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:32,000
[Rei] But then again I don't
think you ever did.

202
00:12:40,633 --> 00:12:43,700
I felt someone was in there,
so I just waited.

203
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,333
I didn't hear any voices.

204
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:51,333
Go ahead, he's all yours
Miss Busujima.

205
00:12:51,433 --> 00:12:54,633
Maybe talking to you will
make him happy.

206
00:12:55,466 --> 00:12:57,200
Understood.

207
00:12:57,733 --> 00:12:58,800
By the way...

208
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:00,500
Yes, what is it?

209
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:04,100
I would really appreciate it
if you would not call me
that anymore.

210
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,633
You know you and I
are actually...

211
00:13:05,733 --> 00:13:07,700
[Rei] Don't bring that up!

212
00:13:08,733 --> 00:13:11,466
That's the last thing
I want to think about.

213
00:13:30,233 --> 00:13:31,800
More survivors?

214
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:33,733
[Yuki] Please, please help us!

215
00:13:33,833 --> 00:13:37,566
We came from the school,
but there's been no place
we could go!

216
00:13:37,666 --> 00:13:40,866
You've got to help us!

217
00:13:40,966 --> 00:13:43,833
You can't just turn us away!

218
00:13:43,933 --> 00:13:45,633
A‐All right, f‐f‐fine.

219
00:13:45,733 --> 00:13:48,766
[guard] J‐Just give me a minute.
Let me move the barricade
right now.

220
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:57,800
[Soichiro]
Find your family no matter what?

221
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:59,900
That's right.
My father lives far away,

222
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,200
so I can only pray
that he's safe.

223
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:06,900
As for my mother, she was
teaching in Nidoko about the
time all this hell started.

224
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,600
So I have a shot at finding her.

225
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:10,766
[Takashi] Rei's...

226
00:14:10,866 --> 00:14:13,000
I mean, Miyamoto's father
is a cop,

227
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:16,900
so I can find out what's
going on if I go to the
East Police Department.

228
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,533
Her mother should be
at her house.

229
00:14:19,633 --> 00:14:23,066
And? What are your plans
after you find her?

230
00:14:23,166 --> 00:14:26,766
The day after tomorrow,
we're going to leave here
early in the morning.

231
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:31,866
It is far too dangerous
for any of us to remain
in the metro areas.

232
00:14:31,966 --> 00:14:36,600
Don't worry. I'll go find
everyone and be back by
that time.

233
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:39,900
I'm sorry, I can't guarantee
that I would take them in.

234
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,633
[Takashi] Fine then...
Let's play it this way.

235
00:14:42,733 --> 00:14:46,233
If I don't get back here
by the time you need
to leave, leave me.

236
00:14:46,333 --> 00:14:50,300
It means I've decided to stay
with Mom or something happened.

237
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:56,200
[Saeko]
I want you to take me with you.

238
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:02,266
Oh, Jesus Christ.

239
00:15:02,366 --> 00:15:04,633
Do you really need
attention that bad?

240
00:15:04,733 --> 00:15:05,633
Hm?

241
00:15:05,733 --> 00:15:06,833
Uh, the outfit.

242
00:15:06,933 --> 00:15:09,566
S‐Saeko, it looks really
great on you,

243
00:15:09,666 --> 00:15:12,466
but don't you think you should
stay here with the others?

244
00:15:13,833 --> 00:15:16,266
[Saeko]
I think I can be of help.

245
00:15:16,366 --> 00:15:19,166
Besides, you're going to need
some people to lead them.

246
00:15:19,266 --> 00:15:22,300
How will the family
find their way back?

247
00:15:23,233 --> 00:15:24,966
Yeah, that's true, but...

248
00:15:25,066 --> 00:15:27,066
Wh‐ Rei!

249
00:15:29,233 --> 00:15:30,966
Rei! Come back!

250
00:15:31,066 --> 00:15:32,400
Oh no, that's...

251
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:34,666
I have to say, I never thought
I'd be helping someone

252
00:15:34,766 --> 00:15:38,300
like the son of Representative
Shido at a time like this.

253
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:41,966
Too bad now isn't the time
to be planning for his
reelection campaign.

254
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:43,433
That's all right, sir.

255
00:15:43,533 --> 00:15:47,500
Need I remind you, right now
I'm just a simple teacher.

256
00:15:48,933 --> 00:15:50,233
I'm impressed.

257
00:15:50,333 --> 00:15:52,833
Not only did you manage to
escape from the school,

258
00:15:52,933 --> 00:15:54,866
but you saved about
a dozen kids.

259
00:15:54,966 --> 00:15:57,933
Of course, that's my duty
as a teacher.

260
00:15:58,033 --> 00:16:02,333
[Yoshioka] If your father knew
what you were doing, I'm sure
he'd be very proud.

261
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:06,666
<i>Really, you don't say?</i>

262
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:13,233
[Shido]
<i>To most people, my father is a</i>
<i>congressional representative.</i>

263
00:16:15,033 --> 00:16:17,566
<i>To me he was just a tyrant.</i>

264
00:16:17,666 --> 00:16:19,966
<i>He made my mother suffer,</i>

265
00:16:20,066 --> 00:16:22,066
<i>and drove her to kill herself.</i>

266
00:16:22,166 --> 00:16:27,900
<i>And even to me, who's abandoned</i>
<i>the family and chosen to</i>
<i>become an educator...</i>

267
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,266
[congressman] There's this
annoying man in the public
safety office in Tokonosu.

268
00:16:32,366 --> 00:16:36,700
Supposedly, his daughter goes to
the school where you work.

269
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:41,700
Here's what I would like you to
do. Make her repeat the grade.

270
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:44,133
That'll teach him a lesson.

271
00:16:44,233 --> 00:16:47,133
[Shido] Will you please
at least help my students?

272
00:16:47,233 --> 00:16:49,166
I don't care about
my own well being at all!

273
00:16:49,266 --> 00:16:50,633
[Rei] How admirable!

274
00:16:50,733 --> 00:16:52,366
[click]

275
00:16:52,466 --> 00:16:54,966
Mr. Shido!

276
00:16:55,066 --> 00:17:00,266
M‐Miss Miyamoto,
thank goodness you're all right.

277
00:17:00,366 --> 00:17:03,933
[Rei] Do you know why I'm good
at handling a spear?

278
00:17:04,033 --> 00:17:05,800
Because I've learned
the bayonet too.

279
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:09,866
By my father, who's never lost
a competition in his life!

280
00:17:09,966 --> 00:17:12,633
To think how you made my
father suffer.

281
00:17:12,733 --> 00:17:17,366
The man who had never been
fazed by anything apologized
to me in tears!

282
00:17:17,466 --> 00:17:21,300
He said I had to repeat the
grade because of him!

283
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:26,033
[Rei] But I know that
only you can control
the students' grades!

284
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:29,433
But I held my temper.

285
00:17:29,533 --> 00:17:32,966
Because he told me that
he'd be able to arrest you
and your father

286
00:17:33,066 --> 00:17:35,166
if his investigation
went smoothly!

287
00:17:35,266 --> 00:17:38,733
But now... you pay.

288
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,533
A‐Are you going to
commit murder?

289
00:17:42,633 --> 00:17:45,066
You're a policeman's daughter
for God's sake!

290
00:17:45,166 --> 00:17:46,866
You don't want to become
a criminal, do you?

291
00:17:46,966 --> 00:17:49,733
I don't want to hear that
from you!

292
00:17:51,433 --> 00:17:54,466
[Soichiro]
Then, you should kill him!

293
00:17:54,566 --> 00:17:59,133
Once I had an association
with this man's father.

294
00:17:59,233 --> 00:18:02,033
[Soichiro]
But now, that means nothing.

295
00:18:02,133 --> 00:18:03,566
If you wish...

296
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:05,333
kill him!

297
00:18:06,533 --> 00:18:08,133
Let me go!

298
00:18:08,233 --> 00:18:11,466
She has to make this
decision for herself.

299
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,100
Go ahead and kill me.

300
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:16,866
I welcome it.
Just know that when you do,

301
00:18:16,966 --> 00:18:20,800
you'll be haunted by this
violent act of vengence
as long as you live!

302
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:26,000
And having learned that is
the best lesson that I could
teach you as your instructor!

303
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:28,600
Do not fail this test.

304
00:18:55,233 --> 00:18:57,766
Are you certain this is
your decision?

305
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:01,433
He's not even worth killing.

306
00:19:06,833 --> 00:19:08,166
[Soichiro] Get out of here!

307
00:19:08,266 --> 00:19:10,566
And take your students!

308
00:19:10,666 --> 00:19:14,133
The ones who have already been
infected by your evil!

309
00:19:33,139 --> 00:19:36,705
[radio] Captain,
we've received a new order
for emergency action!

310
00:19:36,805 --> 00:19:38,439
Code 666 Delta!

311
00:19:38,539 --> 00:19:41,439
I repeat: Code 666 Delta!

312
00:19:41,539 --> 00:19:45,905
Doomsday order for the target
November Kilo and Romeo Charlie!

313
00:19:46,005 --> 00:19:47,205
[captain] Roger that.

314
00:19:47,305 --> 00:19:49,372
Number One to the control tower
right away.

315
00:19:49,472 --> 00:19:51,672
I confirm the order.

316
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:57,705
All right then, have you
confirmed it, Number One?

317
00:20:01,839 --> 00:20:03,172
This is your captain.

318
00:20:03,272 --> 00:20:07,205
The executive order from
Air Force One has just
been confirmed.

319
00:20:07,305 --> 00:20:11,139
[captain] Now we begin attacking
November Kilo and Romeo Charlie.

320
00:20:11,239 --> 00:20:12,905
Man your stations!

321
00:20:16,272 --> 00:20:17,672
I wonder who's president?

322
00:20:17,772 --> 00:20:21,105
They say everyone's been bitten
and has already turned.

323
00:20:21,205 --> 00:20:23,872
I bet they're already down to
the Energy Secretary by now.

324
00:20:23,972 --> 00:20:27,639
Homeland Security Secretary
was the president the day
before yesterday,

325
00:20:27,739 --> 00:20:30,839
but he was already bitten at
that point, God damnit.

326
00:20:30,939 --> 00:20:34,739
No one knows... no one knows
what's going to happen anymore.

327
00:20:34,839 --> 00:20:36,972
[number one] The world's gone
to Hell, Captain.

328
00:20:40,439 --> 00:20:43,039
This is it.
Good God, forgive us.

329
00:20:43,139 --> 00:20:45,739
If there is a God anymore.

330
00:20:47,239 --> 00:20:48,839
Firing one!

331
00:20:48,939 --> 00:20:50,605
[alarm]

332
00:22:41,539 --> 00:22:44,005
[astronaut] Again,
and it's not just America.

333
00:22:44,105 --> 00:22:45,605
Russia is shooting too.

334
00:22:45,705 --> 00:22:48,639
Russia? I thought they couldn't
afford to shoot missiles?

335
00:22:48,739 --> 00:22:51,205
[astronaut]
They're just being reactionary.

336
00:22:51,305 --> 00:22:53,639
Multiple warheads...
Might not be very many,

337
00:22:53,739 --> 00:22:56,972
but they'll wipe out all
major cities and military bases.

338
00:23:01,139 --> 00:23:02,205
My God...

339
00:23:02,305 --> 00:23:05,405
Yeah,
that's the current condition.

340
00:23:12,205 --> 00:23:14,839
First living dead,
then a nuclear strike?

341
00:23:14,939 --> 00:23:18,339
When we land, there will be
nothing to go home to.

342
00:23:18,439 --> 00:23:20,772
[astronaut]
Actually, they used it.

343
00:23:22,239 --> 00:23:24,305
Oh, my God...

344
00:23:31,605 --> 00:23:33,672
[astronaut] It's Armageddon...
