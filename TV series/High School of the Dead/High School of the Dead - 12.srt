1
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:07,933
[radio] We've got information
on the target!

2
00:00:08,033 --> 00:00:09,800
Moments before the
Trident warhead was launched,

3
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:13,633
they confirmed four Delta
Foxtrot 21 from the Tsuka Base!

4
00:00:13,733 --> 00:00:17,266
After that, the target is
Alpha, Bravo, Charlie, Delta.

5
00:00:17,366 --> 00:00:19,200
Repeat:
Alpha, Bravo, Charlie, Delta.

6
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:22,766
[captain] Soon, we may be
the only ones left.

7
00:00:24,666 --> 00:00:25,766
Ready, sir.

8
00:00:25,866 --> 00:00:27,566
Shift the system to BMD mode.

9
00:00:27,666 --> 00:00:30,900
[captain] CIC designated target,
begin shooting.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,900
Commence firing!

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,500
[in unison] Fire!

12
00:00:41,533 --> 00:00:43,500
[crewman]
Ten seconds until intercept.

13
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,333
9... 8... 7...

14
00:00:46,433 --> 00:00:49,066
6... 5... 4...

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,500
Standby!

16
00:00:52,866 --> 00:00:54,366
[gasp]

17
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:58,900
[crewman] Our SM‐3 shot down
the target Alpha!

18
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,066
Kirishima and the USS Shiloh
shot down Bravo and Charlie
as well!

19
00:01:03,166 --> 00:01:04,666
There's one more missile left.

20
00:01:04,766 --> 00:01:07,400
That's dedicated for the target
for <i>Curtis Wilbur.</i>

21
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:10,133
[captain]
Shit! What the hell's going on?

22
00:01:14,333 --> 00:01:16,233
[radio]
<i>Curtis Wilbur,</i> this is <i>Kongo!</i>

23
00:01:16,333 --> 00:01:17,733
Why aren't you shooting?

24
00:01:17,833 --> 00:01:19,733
Come in! Come in!
[wheezing]

25
00:01:22,333 --> 00:01:23,900
[astronaut] One missile left.

26
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,200
Where's it headed?

27
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:28,266
Wait a minute,
could it be the States?

28
00:01:28,366 --> 00:01:30,500
Doesn't look like it... Hold on.

29
00:01:43,166 --> 00:01:46,000
[man] Hey, what the hell
just happened?

30
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,033
That light!
Did anybody see the light?!

31
00:01:49,133 --> 00:01:51,666
You're the police, aren't you?
What was it?!

32
00:01:53,966 --> 00:01:55,633
[Rika] It's simple.

33
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:05,566
Starting today, all of our
nights are going to be
darkness itself.

34
00:03:46,966 --> 00:03:50,033
Yes! Yes, I did it!
Now I remember!

35
00:03:50,133 --> 00:03:54,133
Oh, yes! I'm sure of it!
There's no doubt!

36
00:03:54,233 --> 00:03:56,600
[Arisu]
What's the matter with her?

37
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:58,000
I just remembered!

38
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:00,000
I remembered my friend's
phone number!

39
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:03,166
You mean the one with all
the guns and the Hum‐Vee?

40
00:04:03,266 --> 00:04:04,466
[Shizuka] That's right!

41
00:04:04,566 --> 00:04:07,833
She's in the SAT,
the Special Assault Team,

42
00:04:07,933 --> 00:04:10,033
so she must be still alive!

43
00:04:10,133 --> 00:04:12,633
[Shizuka] More importantly,
oh, give me the phone!

44
00:04:12,733 --> 00:04:14,400
Uh, okay...

45
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:18,800
Now, let's see... There's the
one, and there's the two,

46
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:21,933
and the three and the four,
yeah, all the numbers are
where they're supposed‐

47
00:04:22,033 --> 00:04:24,233
Do you want me
to press it for you?

48
00:04:24,333 --> 00:04:27,733
You're going to make me mess
up, so don't interrupt me. 'Kay?

49
00:04:27,833 --> 00:04:30,166
[ringing]

50
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:34,033
[Rika] Hello?

51
00:04:34,133 --> 00:04:37,633
Rika?! Oh thank God,
you're alive!

52
00:04:37,733 --> 00:04:40,500
[Arisu] I'm happy for you!
I was so worried about you.

53
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,433
Takashi...

54
00:04:41,533 --> 00:04:43,533
Well,
now it looks like we can...

55
00:04:43,633 --> 00:04:48,366
[Shizuka] Oh, a lot of things
have happened to me too, but...

56
00:04:48,466 --> 00:04:51,500
Cut to the chase, will you?
Where are you right now?

57
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,800
My place?

58
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:54,833
[Shizuka]
That place isn't good anymore.

59
00:04:54,933 --> 00:04:56,633
Oh, we borrowed
your guns and stuff.

60
00:04:56,733 --> 00:04:58,900
[Rika] That's okay. Just tell me
where you are right now‐

61
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,500
[bzzt]

62
00:05:23,133 --> 00:05:25,333
[Shizuka] Uh, hello? Rika?!

63
00:05:25,433 --> 00:05:27,500
Jesus Christ, what happened?

64
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,100
That light...

65
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:31,766
Oh, no way...

66
00:05:31,866 --> 00:05:34,600
[Saya]
Miyamoto, check the gun's sight!

67
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:35,900
What? But why?

68
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,333
[Saya] Just check it!

69
00:05:37,433 --> 00:05:40,300
Yours should be using the IC!

70
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:45,733
How is it? Do you see the dot?

71
00:05:45,833 --> 00:05:48,233
Well, I can't see.

72
00:05:48,833 --> 00:05:49,966
I knew it.

73
00:05:50,066 --> 00:05:53,066
[Takashi]
Takagi, what's going on?

74
00:05:55,833 --> 00:05:58,366
Hey, what are you doing?
Hurry up!

75
00:05:58,466 --> 00:06:00,666
[guard] Something's wrong
with the engine.

76
00:06:00,766 --> 00:06:01,900
What happened?

77
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,133
The PC went dead
when we lost the power.

78
00:06:05,766 --> 00:06:07,733
Someone, please help me!

79
00:06:07,833 --> 00:06:11,333
I think my husband's having
a heartattack! Help me!

80
00:06:15,066 --> 00:06:17,000
What's wrong with these
God damn breaks?

81
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:18,166
Where's the emergency break?!

82
00:06:18,266 --> 00:06:20,600
Mr. Shido, in front of you!

83
00:06:24,866 --> 00:06:26,533
[crash]

84
00:06:37,766 --> 00:06:39,766
I‐I‐I'm alive...

85
00:06:43,833 --> 00:06:45,900
H‐Hey...

86
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,600
[guard] We're in trouble...

87
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:49,733
Cell phone's no good.

88
00:06:49,833 --> 00:06:52,633
All right, let's get ready
for 'em!

89
00:06:52,733 --> 00:06:54,100
No way, man! I'm leaving!

90
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,900
Come back here!

91
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Fuckin' pussy!

92
00:06:59,066 --> 00:07:00,433
Shit!

93
00:07:00,533 --> 00:07:01,433
[gunshots]

94
00:07:01,533 --> 00:07:02,533
[Takashi] HANE?

95
00:07:02,633 --> 00:07:06,133
[Saya] High‐altitude
nuclear explosion. Duh.

96
00:07:06,233 --> 00:07:08,900
Do I have to explain
everything to you people?

97
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,600
[Saya] The explosion of the
nuclear warhead in the upper
atmosphere creates Compton
electrons.

98
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:17,000
Gamma rays then sputter those
electrons from the
atmospheric molecules.

99
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:21,033
The sputtered electrons
accelerate and spiral along the
Earth's magnetic field,

100
00:07:21,133 --> 00:07:26,866
generating an electromagnetic
pulse and such effect is lethal
for electronic devices.

101
00:07:26,966 --> 00:07:30,233
That pulse can travel
through anything that
works as an antenna,

102
00:07:30,333 --> 00:07:33,100
and fries its
integrated circuit.

103
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,700
[Saeko] So, basically,
right now we can't‐

104
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,800
[Saya] Connect the dots, hunny.
All electronics are dead.

105
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:41,766
What? So that means we can't use
cell phones and stuff anymore?

106
00:07:41,866 --> 00:07:45,500
[Saya] Not only cell phones,
but we won't be able to
use computers.

107
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,400
[Saya] Cars with computers
won't work.
[Arisu] There, there. It's okay.

108
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,966
[Saya] The power plants will
be dead too,

109
00:07:50,066 --> 00:07:52,900
unless they were implementing
EMP measures.

110
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,733
But I know only a small portion

111
00:07:54,833 --> 00:07:59,233
of Self Defense Forces and
the government agencies are
using such measures.

112
00:08:02,266 --> 00:08:04,466
Is there a way to fix it?

113
00:08:04,566 --> 00:08:06,300
Daddy!

114
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:11,266
[Saya] Some cars could work if
we replace the fried parts.

115
00:08:11,366 --> 00:08:13,666
And we might be able to
find undamaged cars,

116
00:08:13,766 --> 00:08:17,533
which have sustained less
effect of electromagnetic waves.

117
00:08:17,633 --> 00:08:20,800
They should work if they don't
have the computer chips in them.

118
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:22,133
[Soichiro] Go check right away.

119
00:08:22,233 --> 00:08:23,266
[yesman] Yes, sir.

120
00:08:23,366 --> 00:08:25,533
[Soichiro] Saya!
[Saya] Y‐Yes, sir?

121
00:08:25,633 --> 00:08:29,966
I must say I'm impressed how
you stayed calm and rational
in this commotion.

122
00:08:30,066 --> 00:08:32,433
You deserve my praise.

123
00:08:34,166 --> 00:08:35,266
Daddy?
[gunshot]

124
00:08:35,366 --> 00:08:37,400
[guard] Look!
Look at the barricade!

125
00:08:39,666 --> 00:08:41,500
Get back! Get back!

126
00:08:43,033 --> 00:08:47,266
[screaming]

127
00:08:49,833 --> 00:08:52,133
Close the gate! Hurry up!

128
00:08:52,233 --> 00:08:54,433
Don't let the dead come inside!

129
00:08:54,533 --> 00:08:58,400
Commander, we still have
a lot of our men on the
outside of the complex!

130
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:01,400
[Soichiro] We'll lose everything
if we don't close the gate now!

131
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,433
Do it!

132
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,666
[guard] One got in!

133
00:09:13,533 --> 00:09:15,366
Inside the pocket...

134
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,533
That's one for the home team.

135
00:09:18,633 --> 00:09:21,533
I'm sorry, kid,
I was wrong about you!

136
00:09:21,633 --> 00:09:25,166
Commander! Madam!
I brought this as you requested!

137
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:34,766
[in unison] What?!

138
00:09:34,866 --> 00:09:36,800
Mama...

139
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:39,066
[Yuriko] Use it, Saya.

140
00:09:39,166 --> 00:09:43,133
That's‐ That's a Luger P08
Holland colonial model!

141
00:09:43,233 --> 00:09:45,500
I don't even know
how to use this thing!

142
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,900
Wait a minute! What are you
even doing with a gun?!

143
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,033
[Kota] The stock and
the drum magazine too?

144
00:09:50,133 --> 00:09:54,666
[Yuriko] When I was working on
Wall Street, I was taking the
executive self‐defense course.

145
00:09:54,766 --> 00:09:57,633
Actually, I might be a better
shooter than your father.

146
00:09:59,633 --> 00:10:03,400
You will show her how to use it,
won't you, Hirano?

147
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:04,600
Yes, Mama!

148
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:07,466
No, that's not what I mean,
I meant "yes ma'am"...

149
00:10:07,566 --> 00:10:09,233
Yes, Mama!

150
00:10:25,133 --> 00:10:27,400
We're screwed man!
Can't hold 'em!

151
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:29,033
[creak]

152
00:10:29,133 --> 00:10:31,200
Th‐They'll get in!

153
00:10:47,044 --> 00:10:51,944
[wheezing]

154
00:10:52,044 --> 00:10:55,910
Master, run!
Get out of here!

155
00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:01,310
[screaming]

156
00:11:04,944 --> 00:11:06,777
Everybody get back!

157
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:14,644
[screaming]

158
00:11:19,244 --> 00:11:21,144
Help me!

159
00:11:21,244 --> 00:11:23,577
Someone help me!

160
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:31,577
Stop it!
Just calm down and we can talk!

161
00:11:31,677 --> 00:11:33,544
If you get treated
at the hospital,

162
00:11:33,644 --> 00:11:37,877
I'm sure
your disease will be...

163
00:11:40,944 --> 00:11:42,777
[lady] It's your fault!

164
00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:44,477
I was...

165
00:11:44,577 --> 00:11:49,944
I was trying very hard
to help you!

166
00:11:50,044 --> 00:11:52,244
Die!

167
00:11:54,644 --> 00:11:57,577
Die! Die!

168
00:12:01,044 --> 00:12:02,710
[gunshot]

169
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:07,210
Shoulder the gun and
lean into it...

170
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:09,644
[Takashi]
Aim around the chest...

171
00:12:09,744 --> 00:12:11,410
Fire!

172
00:12:49,977 --> 00:12:51,644
Kota, here!

173
00:12:56,577 --> 00:12:58,010
This shit never ends.

174
00:12:58,110 --> 00:12:59,377
[Saeko] I know.

175
00:12:59,477 --> 00:13:02,744
It only gets worse
as time goes on.

176
00:13:02,844 --> 00:13:05,444
[Kota] We'll run out of
bullets soon too!

177
00:13:24,010 --> 00:13:26,744
[Yoshioka] Commander, our scouts
have confirmed.

178
00:13:26,844 --> 00:13:30,810
The troops stationed at the
house next door haven't
been attacked yet.

179
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:33,710
And I believe we can reinforce
the all the doors and gates.

180
00:13:37,877 --> 00:13:41,310
[Soichiro] We'll rip through the
enemies and head to next door.

181
00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:43,544
Come if you're a man and
ready to battle.

182
00:13:43,644 --> 00:13:45,544
And as for the women
and children,

183
00:13:45,644 --> 00:13:49,777
stay close behind immediately,
if you want to survive.

184
00:13:49,877 --> 00:13:53,144
[Yuriko] Saya...
[Saya] Dad, why don't we just
barricade ourselves in the‐

185
00:13:53,244 --> 00:13:55,244
They broke through
the iron gate!

186
00:13:55,344 --> 00:13:58,410
What's the point of trying
to protect the house?

187
00:13:58,510 --> 00:14:00,510
[Soichiro] Even if we barricade
ourselves in the mansion,

188
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:04,544
they'll still break in
and kill us all.

189
00:14:04,644 --> 00:14:08,777
I thought you were going to
help your parents, were you not?

190
00:14:10,210 --> 00:14:12,577
[Soichiro]
Then, you should be on your way.

191
00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:16,410
Yes, sir.

192
00:14:16,510 --> 00:14:18,377
[Soichiro] Hirano...

193
00:14:19,144 --> 00:14:20,977
Take care of my daughter.

194
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:25,377
Dad, what do you mean by that?!

195
00:14:29,244 --> 00:14:31,010
Mom?

196
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:32,477
Stop acting like a child.

197
00:14:32,577 --> 00:14:35,977
Your father and I have
work to do. Deal with it.

198
00:14:36,077 --> 00:14:39,477
[Yuriko] I've left you many
times during your life
and I'm sorry for that.

199
00:14:39,577 --> 00:14:42,444
I hope some day you'll
forgive me.

200
00:14:42,544 --> 00:14:46,377
But this time I'm leaving you
because I have to.

201
00:14:46,477 --> 00:14:49,977
I'm not leaving you
because I want to.

202
00:14:50,077 --> 00:14:51,677
[Saya] Mommy...

203
00:14:52,810 --> 00:14:54,310
Mrs. Takagi...

204
00:14:55,977 --> 00:14:57,244
Be a good girl.

205
00:14:57,344 --> 00:15:00,410
But more importantly,
be a strong one.

206
00:15:03,044 --> 00:15:06,277
[Yuriko] You listen to your big
brothers and big sisters, okay?

207
00:15:06,377 --> 00:15:08,244
[Arisu] Okay.

208
00:15:11,277 --> 00:15:12,944
[Yuriko] Now...

209
00:15:15,844 --> 00:15:17,677
Get out of here!

210
00:15:18,744 --> 00:15:21,577
Daddy... Mommy...

211
00:15:22,244 --> 00:15:24,277
I love you so much!

212
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:30,144
Throw the dynamite!

213
00:15:30,244 --> 00:15:32,277
Yes, sir!

214
00:15:46,244 --> 00:15:47,910
[Saya] Mr. Maddo!

215
00:15:50,977 --> 00:15:52,277
They're not here?

216
00:15:52,377 --> 00:15:54,844
Lady Saya...

217
00:15:54,944 --> 00:15:56,477
What are you doing down there?

218
00:15:56,577 --> 00:15:58,410
You're lucky, Lady Saya.

219
00:15:58,510 --> 00:16:02,277
This here's
anti‐electromagnetic pulse.

220
00:16:02,377 --> 00:16:04,544
[Maddo]
It's triple copper plated.

221
00:16:04,644 --> 00:16:07,810
The owner of this
must be hardcore.

222
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:10,510
So you're saying that
this car can still drive?

223
00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:13,210
[Maddo] But it needs some repair
because it's been damaged.

224
00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:14,977
It'll take a while.

225
00:16:15,377 --> 00:16:16,577
Well then,

226
00:16:16,677 --> 00:16:19,344
looks like this is
where we make a stand.

227
00:16:26,077 --> 00:16:27,910
Here they come!

228
00:16:39,544 --> 00:16:43,810
Doesn't look very good.
Not for us anyway, darling.

229
00:16:45,444 --> 00:16:47,310
[Soichiro] Yuriko...

230
00:16:48,077 --> 00:16:49,744
You are a good woman.

231
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:53,377
[Soichiro] Let's go!

232
00:17:07,144 --> 00:17:08,977
Get back!

233
00:17:10,244 --> 00:17:11,910
I got it!

234
00:17:15,710 --> 00:17:17,277
That's so cool!

235
00:17:17,377 --> 00:17:18,977
You're such a ditz!

236
00:17:19,077 --> 00:17:20,910
Well that is my character
after all.

237
00:17:21,010 --> 00:17:22,844
[Saya] Just get in the car!

238
00:17:23,244 --> 00:17:25,044
Okay!

239
00:17:25,144 --> 00:17:26,644
[gunshot]

240
00:17:27,377 --> 00:17:28,644
[Kota] Just like the Alamo!

241
00:17:28,744 --> 00:17:30,077
[Takashi]
That's not very encouraging.

242
00:17:30,177 --> 00:17:31,844
[Kota] Tell me about it!

243
00:17:41,944 --> 00:17:43,610
[Takashi] Rei!

244
00:17:47,444 --> 00:17:49,744
Are you okay?

245
00:17:49,844 --> 00:17:50,977
[Takashi] Let's go!

246
00:17:51,077 --> 00:17:53,810
Yeah! You're right!

247
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:56,610
I wish I could have messed with
it a little more, but...

248
00:17:56,710 --> 00:17:58,144
All right!

249
00:17:58,244 --> 00:17:59,744
[Maddo] You're good!

250
00:17:59,844 --> 00:18:01,510
Come on!

251
00:18:03,944 --> 00:18:05,744
It's working!

252
00:18:05,844 --> 00:18:07,844
Everyone, get back here!

253
00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:14,010
Mr. Matsudo, get in the car.

254
00:18:16,077 --> 00:18:17,477
I'm afraid
I can't go with ya.

255
00:18:17,577 --> 00:18:20,477
My true love is here
and I'm not leaving her.

256
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:26,444
Lady Saya, please take care!

257
00:18:29,377 --> 00:18:31,777
[Shizuka] Here we go!

258
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:39,277
All right!
Come here, you fuckers!

259
00:18:45,610 --> 00:18:48,310
[screech]

260
00:19:01,210 --> 00:19:02,944
[Rei] Which way do we go now?

261
00:19:03,044 --> 00:19:05,244
[Saeko] You're looking at it.

262
00:19:06,377 --> 00:19:08,844
What? It's too narrow.

263
00:19:10,844 --> 00:19:12,510
[Saeko] Keep going!

264
00:19:19,910 --> 00:19:21,744
Saeko!

265
00:19:31,377 --> 00:19:32,944
[Soichiro] They're gone.

266
00:19:33,044 --> 00:19:35,644
[Yuriko] I don't know
if we were the best parents.

267
00:19:35,744 --> 00:19:38,277
But hopefully
she's learned from us.

268
00:19:38,377 --> 00:19:40,410
She'll be all right.

269
00:19:41,877 --> 00:19:43,544
Well now...

270
00:19:44,477 --> 00:19:46,910
Then there's nothing
to hold me back!

271
00:20:00,377 --> 00:20:03,244
It's okay for now, I guess.

272
00:20:04,610 --> 00:20:09,010
[Saya] Please don't say
anything! Just don't!

273
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:10,010
[Kota] Takagi!

274
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:11,210
What is it?

275
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:13,010
Be sure to keep an eye out!

276
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:14,810
Hirano, what are you‐

277
00:20:14,910 --> 00:20:16,144
It's okay...

278
00:20:16,244 --> 00:20:17,877
[Saya] It's okay.

279
00:20:17,977 --> 00:20:19,210
Hirano is...

280
00:20:19,310 --> 00:20:21,610
Kota is right!

281
00:20:21,710 --> 00:20:22,410
[bang]

282
00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:23,577
And I hate to bring it up,

283
00:20:23,677 --> 00:20:25,377
but the engine sounds strange.

284
00:20:25,477 --> 00:20:28,244
Yeah, I kinda think there's
something wrong with the car.

285
00:20:28,344 --> 00:20:30,044
Can I stop driving soon?

286
00:20:30,144 --> 00:20:32,044
No, keep driving.

287
00:20:32,144 --> 00:20:34,210
I'm sorry,
but Rei and I can't stop

288
00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:36,677
until we both find our parents.

289
00:20:36,777 --> 00:20:40,444
After that, we'll look for
your friend too, okay?

290
00:20:41,244 --> 00:20:42,877
[Shizuka] O‐Okay!

291
00:20:42,977 --> 00:20:44,810
There's a highway. Take it.

292
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:55,977
[wheezing]

293
00:21:00,144 --> 00:21:02,344
There's so many...

294
00:21:03,577 --> 00:21:04,877
Ahem...

295
00:21:07,977 --> 00:21:09,810
Oh, well.

296
00:21:20,777 --> 00:21:23,010
[Takashi]
Let's end this little road trip.

297
00:21:27,877 --> 00:21:29,710
With a fuckin' bang!

298
00:23:14,877 --> 00:23:17,844
[Takashi]
<i>You're always wondering how</i>
<i>things are going to end.</i>

299
00:23:21,310 --> 00:23:24,310
<i>And you make up these scenarios</i>
<i>in your head.</i>

300
00:23:24,977 --> 00:23:26,677
<i>But you know what?</i>

301
00:23:31,344 --> 00:23:33,944
<i>Every single one of them</i>
<i>you thought of,</i>

302
00:23:34,044 --> 00:23:37,244
<i>you were dead wrong.</i>

303
00:23:37,344 --> 00:23:41,910
<i>Because life, even among the</i>
<i>dead, keeps going.</i>
