1
00:00:02,133 --> 00:00:05,033
[reporter] The government
has begun to discuss the
emergency measures.

2
00:00:05,133 --> 00:00:09,833
However, the mobilization of
Self‐Defense Forces has been the
subject of a frantic‐

3
00:00:09,933 --> 00:00:13,566
[channel change]
10,000 have been victimized in
the Saitama area so far.

4
00:00:13,666 --> 00:00:15,966
The governor has already called‐
[gunshot]

5
00:00:16,066 --> 00:00:21,133
Already declared the state
of emergency and requested
emergency disaster relief...

6
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:22,800
[gunshots]

7
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:24,233
[reporter] It's a gunshot!

8
00:00:24,333 --> 00:00:26,533
It looks like the police are
finally using firearms!

9
00:00:26,633 --> 00:00:27,766
From what I can see, the‐

10
00:00:27,866 --> 00:00:30,600
No, don't! No!
[screaming]

11
00:00:33,533 --> 00:00:37,566
[concerned murmurs]

12
00:00:39,333 --> 00:00:41,200
There appears to be a problem
with our remote.

13
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:45,900
[newscaster] From now on, we'll
bring you the story from inside
the studio.

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,233
The condition outside seem
extremely chaotic,

15
00:00:48,333 --> 00:00:52,366
so stay home unless it's
absolutely necessary to
go outside.

16
00:00:52,466 --> 00:00:58,066
We'll bring you more stories as
soon as it's safe to cover the
current situation from the site.

17
00:00:58,500 --> 00:00:59,400
Is that all?

18
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:01,866
Why didn't they tell us
anything else?

19
00:01:01,966 --> 00:01:03,766
[Saeko] They're afraid of
causing a panic.

20
00:01:03,866 --> 00:01:04,833
A panic?

21
00:01:04,933 --> 00:01:06,800
[Saya] Yeah you idiot.

22
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,866
First panic, then chaos,

23
00:01:08,966 --> 00:01:11,933
and chaos causes a disruption
of order.

24
00:01:12,033 --> 00:01:15,166
And then, when order
is disrupted,

25
00:01:15,266 --> 00:01:18,133
well you should just hand it all
over to the walking corpses!

26
00:01:18,233 --> 00:01:21,433
This unusal and unprecedented
biological phenomenon...

27
00:01:21,533 --> 00:01:23,000
that spread throughout
North America...

28
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:24,733
has yet to be put
under control.

29
00:01:24,833 --> 00:01:27,266
[reporter] Government
authorities have evacuated
the White House...

30
00:01:27,366 --> 00:01:32,300
and will relocate to a command
center on board the aircraft
carrier George Washington.

31
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,300
There are reports that the
transfer of power is in
preparation...

32
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:39,266
for the use of tactical warheads
to combat the infestation.

33
00:01:39,366 --> 00:01:42,233
We have currently lost
contact with Moscow.

34
00:01:42,333 --> 00:01:44,200
Beijing has been set ablaze.

35
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:48,466
London has maintained order
while in Paris and Rome, there
are reports of looting.

36
00:01:48,566 --> 00:01:51,866
The government officials
have declared a state of
Martial Law.

37
00:01:51,966 --> 00:01:54,233
[becoming distorted]
Currently, the‐

38
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,700
[Takashi] So they're everywhere.

39
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,333
That's crazy...

40
00:03:37,433 --> 00:03:40,266
Everything was normal when
I checked the internet
this morning.

41
00:03:40,366 --> 00:03:41,833
[Rei] I can't believe this.

42
00:03:41,933 --> 00:03:46,033
This happened all over the world
in a matter of a few hours.

43
00:03:47,433 --> 00:03:49,133
[Rei] But they'll stop
it, right?

44
00:03:49,233 --> 00:03:52,533
I mean they have to stop
it from spreading. I mean‐

45
00:03:52,633 --> 00:03:54,766
Everything is going to back
to normal soon.

46
00:03:54,866 --> 00:03:56,733
[Saya] That's not going
to happen.

47
00:03:56,833 --> 00:03:58,766
[Takashi] Why do you have to
be so blunt about it?

48
00:03:58,866 --> 00:04:00,100
This is a pandemic.

49
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,800
There's nothing we can do!

50
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:03,933
A pandemic?

51
00:04:04,033 --> 00:04:06,266
It's the outbreak of
infectious disease.

52
00:04:06,366 --> 00:04:09,666
The entire world is experiencing
the same outbreak.

53
00:04:09,766 --> 00:04:11,900
[Takashi] So what? It's some
kind of epidemic?

54
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,033
This is exactly like the
Spanish flu in 1918.

55
00:04:16,133 --> 00:04:18,300
[Saya] More than 600 million
people got infected...

56
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,666
and 50 million people died
from it.

57
00:04:20,766 --> 00:04:25,200
Remember how much a panic Swine
flu caused? Well square that.

58
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:29,966
Not to be disagreeable,
but I think this is more
like the Black Death from
the 14th century.

59
00:04:30,066 --> 00:04:34,366
One third of the European
population died.
You're smarter than you look.

60
00:04:34,466 --> 00:04:36,800
So how did the outbreak
finally ended?

61
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:39,000
Well there are many theories.

62
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:41,700
It usually stops when too many
humans die.

63
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:44,700
There wouldn't be enough people
to spread the disease.

64
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,066
[Kota] But now...

65
00:04:47,166 --> 00:04:51,633
All the dead people still move
and start attacking you.

66
00:04:51,733 --> 00:04:56,066
Are you saying that there's
no reason for this outbreak
to stop?

67
00:04:56,166 --> 00:04:57,600
The weather's going to be hot.

68
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:59,700
They might not be able to move
if their flesh decomposes...

69
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,100
and they become skeletons.

70
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:03,033
[Saeko] How long does it take
for that to happen?

71
00:05:03,133 --> 00:05:06,600
In summers, some parts of the
body could become skeletal
in about twenty days.

72
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:09,600
But it takes considerably
longer during winter.

73
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:11,866
A couple months. That's not too
terribly long.

74
00:05:11,966 --> 00:05:15,400
[Saya] You're kidding. She's
not smarter than she looks.

75
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:16,733
So what're saying?

76
00:05:16,833 --> 00:05:19,333
[Saya] Medical logic doesn't
apply to those dead corpses...

77
00:05:19,433 --> 00:05:21,500
that move around and
attack humans.

78
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,733
Worst case scenario, they might
never decompose.

79
00:05:24,833 --> 00:05:27,700
First thing we find out is if
our families are okay.

80
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:31,266
Then we need to find some place
safe to hold up for a while.

81
00:05:31,366 --> 00:05:34,233
[Saeko] But no matter where we
go, we're going to need a plan.

82
00:05:35,133 --> 00:05:38,100
Teams! We need to team up!

83
00:05:44,166 --> 00:05:47,033
Let's try to pick up survivors
whenever we can.

84
00:05:47,133 --> 00:05:48,100
Let's do it.

85
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,466
What's the best way outta here?

86
00:05:49,566 --> 00:05:51,033
Sorry to break it to you,
stupid,

87
00:05:51,133 --> 00:05:53,466
but we're gonna just have
to go out the front.

88
00:05:54,966 --> 00:05:57,200
Let's go!

89
00:06:07,866 --> 00:06:09,500
[Saeko] Let me make
something clear.

90
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,666
There's no need for you to
engage in a fight unless
it's necessary.

91
00:06:12,766 --> 00:06:15,433
Do whatever you can to avoid
a fight, you got it?

92
00:06:15,533 --> 00:06:18,466
Remember, they're sensitive
to sounds so keep it quiet.

93
00:06:18,566 --> 00:06:20,633
And they're strong enough to
rip through regular doors.

94
00:06:20,733 --> 00:06:24,033
And once they've got a hold
on you, they're gonna tear
you to shreds.

95
00:06:24,133 --> 00:06:25,233
So be careful.

96
00:06:25,333 --> 00:06:26,600
[scream]

97
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:29,400
Takuzo...

98
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:30,400
Aw shit...

99
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,500
Stay back!

100
00:06:33,766 --> 00:06:35,100
[thwack]

101
00:06:54,266 --> 00:06:55,633
[Naomi] Uh.. Thank you...

102
00:06:55,733 --> 00:06:57,033
[Saeko] Keep it down.

103
00:06:57,133 --> 00:06:58,866
Has anyone been bitten yet?

104
00:06:58,966 --> 00:07:01,733
What? No, no one.

105
00:07:01,833 --> 00:07:04,433
It looks okay.
We'll be all right.

106
00:07:05,266 --> 00:07:06,400
We're gettin' outta here.

107
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:09,000
Do any of you want to come
with us?

108
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:10,600
[Naomi] S..Sure!

109
00:07:16,466 --> 00:07:18,200
[Takashi] Man, there're a
bunch of Them.

110
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:20,800
From what I can tell, the only
thing they react to are sounds.

111
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:24,333
They can't see us, so it's
pointless to hide from Them.

112
00:07:24,433 --> 00:07:27,433
[Takashi] Why don't you go down
there and prove that theory?

113
00:07:27,533 --> 00:07:30,300
But even if we keep going
through inside the school,

114
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,466
once we get attacked we're
going to be stuck.

115
00:07:32,566 --> 00:07:34,933
We have to go through the gate,
we don't have any choice.

116
00:07:35,033 --> 00:07:40,566
Someone needs to go and confirm
Takagi's theory. Don't suppose
you want to volunteer?

117
00:07:44,166 --> 00:07:46,600
I'll go. I'll do it.

118
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:48,166
No! You stay, I'll go.

119
00:07:48,266 --> 00:07:50,500
I think I should go ahead first.

120
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:53,300
[Takashi] I think you should
just stand by, just in case.

121
00:07:54,633 --> 00:07:57,100
Takashi, why?

122
00:07:58,266 --> 00:08:00,733
[Takashi] I don't know.

123
00:08:00,833 --> 00:08:02,666
[Rei] You don't know?

124
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:07,733
Seriously, I don't know.

125
00:08:07,833 --> 00:08:09,133
[Rei] Taka‐
[Saeko] Don't!

126
00:08:09,233 --> 00:08:11,533
I understand, but you can't
interfere with him.

127
00:08:12,833 --> 00:08:14,100
[Saeko] This was his decision.

128
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:17,466
[groaning and wheezing]

129
00:08:17,566 --> 00:08:48,766
[heartbeat]

130
00:08:48,866 --> 00:08:51,533
<i>So, they really can't see me?</i>

131
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:55,000
<i>If that's the case...</i>

132
00:08:57,866 --> 00:08:59,200
[thud]

133
00:09:21,566 --> 00:09:22,700
[clang]

134
00:09:36,333 --> 00:09:38,200
Run!

135
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:41,900
Why did you open your
big mouth?!

136
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,700
We could've made it here just by
taking care of the ones that are
close by...

137
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,766
if you hadn't said anything!

138
00:09:48,866 --> 00:09:50,733
The noise would've
echoed anyway!

139
00:09:50,833 --> 00:09:53,033
Just start swinging!

140
00:09:56,666 --> 00:09:58,533
There're too many!

141
00:10:04,866 --> 00:10:06,400
Forget talking.

142
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:07,700
Just run!

143
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:10,766
[Takashi] Run!

144
00:10:50,966 --> 00:10:52,033
Takuzo!

145
00:10:52,133 --> 00:10:53,900
Naomi, run!

146
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,133
[scream]

147
00:10:55,233 --> 00:10:56,500
[Naomi] Takuzo!
[Saya] Just forget him!

148
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,300
Once you get bitten,
it's pointless.

149
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:01,900
[sobbing]

150
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,300
[Saya] Wait a minute!

151
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,733
You heard me, didn't you?
He's not gonna make it!

152
00:11:05,833 --> 00:11:08,333
Why are you going back to him?!

153
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,266
[Shizuka] I understand...

154
00:11:11,366 --> 00:11:14,133
If the entire world turned
into this,

155
00:11:14,233 --> 00:11:17,833
I'd rather die with the person
that I love.

156
00:11:17,933 --> 00:11:19,866
Oh shut up Dr. Bleeding Heart!

157
00:11:19,966 --> 00:11:21,700
[Kota] Look out!
[Saya] What?!

158
00:11:22,866 --> 00:11:24,533
Don't you worry, Takagi.

159
00:11:24,633 --> 00:11:26,066
Oh you rude little otaku!

160
00:11:26,166 --> 00:11:29,566
How dare you interrupt me
while I'm talking? Why would
you do that?!

161
00:11:29,666 --> 00:11:33,766
[Kota] I don't know 'cause
I really like your voice...

162
00:11:35,533 --> 00:11:38,533
Nice to see that you two
are getting along.

163
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:42,100
Miss Shizuka, the key!

164
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,133
Target, confirmed.

165
00:11:47,233 --> 00:11:49,100
Got a clear shot, all good.

166
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,933
Ready... aim...

167
00:11:51,033 --> 00:11:53,466
Hurry up and shoot the
damn thing!

168
00:11:57,866 --> 00:11:59,466
Let's go, everybody's inside!

169
00:11:59,566 --> 00:12:01,100
You go! Ladies first!

170
00:12:02,933 --> 00:12:05,133
It's different from my
little bug!

171
00:12:05,233 --> 00:12:09,466
Let's see, gas, brake,
and there's the clutch...

172
00:12:10,566 --> 00:12:11,466
[distant] Help!

173
00:12:11,566 --> 00:12:12,566
Hey! Wait!

174
00:12:12,666 --> 00:12:17,800
[pleading]

175
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:18,900
Who's that?

176
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,300
That's Mr. Shido of Class 3‐A.

177
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,133
Shido...

178
00:12:23,233 --> 00:12:24,566
[Shizuka] We can go now!

179
00:12:24,666 --> 00:12:26,933
[Takashi] Wait just a little
bit longer!

180
00:12:27,033 --> 00:12:28,400
They're in front of us.

181
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,933
Any more and we won't be able
to drive through here.

182
00:12:31,033 --> 00:12:32,566
[Takashi] Run 'em down!

183
00:12:32,666 --> 00:12:36,333
If Dr. Boobs tries to drive
over that many, we'll flip
the bus.

184
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,533
We don't have to save him!

185
00:12:39,633 --> 00:12:42,700
Jesus, what do you mean
we don't have to save him?!

186
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:43,866
We don't have to help him!

187
00:12:43,966 --> 00:12:46,466
We should just live him
here to die!

188
00:12:46,566 --> 00:12:47,833
Hurry, everyone!

189
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:49,533
You're going to be all right!

190
00:12:49,633 --> 00:12:51,733
Okay, Mr. Shido.

191
00:12:51,833 --> 00:12:56,266
<i>But I'm not even sure if we</i>
<i>can make it there at this rate.</i>

192
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:03,666
[student] I sprained my ankle!
Help me up!

193
00:13:03,766 --> 00:13:08,033
Poor boy. How tragic.

194
00:13:08,133 --> 00:13:11,266
Well, I guess that's it for
you then.

195
00:13:13,066 --> 00:13:16,533
[sobbing]

196
00:13:16,633 --> 00:13:19,433
[Shido] The world we've known
is over.

197
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:24,700
The powerless have no place
in the new one.

198
00:13:26,933 --> 00:13:28,500
[scream]

199
00:13:34,866 --> 00:13:35,866
[Takashi] Okay go!

200
00:13:35,966 --> 00:13:37,766
[Shizuka] Hang on!

201
00:13:41,733 --> 00:13:42,633
To the gate!

202
00:13:42,733 --> 00:13:44,100
[Shizuka] I know!

203
00:13:53,033 --> 00:13:54,933
They're not humans anymore...

204
00:13:55,033 --> 00:13:57,033
[Shizuka] They're not
people anymore!

205
00:13:57,133 --> 00:13:58,900
They're not alive anymore!

206
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,333
[engie rev]

207
00:14:21,033 --> 00:14:22,366
Can't believe we did it.

208
00:14:22,466 --> 00:14:23,500
[Kota] Yeah.

209
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,266
Thank God we did!

210
00:14:25,366 --> 00:14:27,833
I take it you have been
appointed leader?

211
00:14:27,933 --> 00:14:29,233
There's no such thing.

212
00:14:29,333 --> 00:14:31,866
We just work together in order
to live, that's all.

213
00:14:31,966 --> 00:14:33,266
[Shido] That's not good...

214
00:14:33,366 --> 00:14:36,266
In order to survive, we
definitely need a leader,

215
00:14:36,366 --> 00:14:41,566
a leader who bears everything
with valor, with confidence.

216
00:14:41,666 --> 00:14:43,533
You'll regret this.

217
00:14:43,633 --> 00:14:47,400
I guarantee that you'll regret
that you helped him!

218
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:49,533
[Yamada] The city!

[boy] Shit!

226
00:15:41,266 --> 00:15:44,366
Like I said, it's only
dangerous if we keep going!

227
00:15:44,466 --> 00:15:47,866
First of all, why do we have to
go with Komuro and the others?

228
00:15:47,966 --> 00:15:51,333
[Tsunoda] You guys are the
ones who decided to go back
to the city.

229
00:15:51,433 --> 00:15:54,533
Maybe we shoulda just looked for
a safe place inside the school.

230
00:15:54,633 --> 00:15:57,166
If you ask me, we were better
off where we were!

231
00:15:57,266 --> 00:15:58,233
[Maruyama] He's right!

232
00:15:58,333 --> 00:16:00,133
I kinda agree with Tsunoda.

233
00:16:00,233 --> 00:16:01,833
We should barricade
ourselves somewhere‐

234
00:16:01,933 --> 00:16:04,266
[screech]

235
00:16:06,833 --> 00:16:08,266
Okay you all, that's enough!

236
00:16:08,366 --> 00:16:11,333
I can't focus on the driving
with all this yelling!

237
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:15,133
Yeah, whatever...

238
00:16:15,233 --> 00:16:18,366
How about you tell me what
you want to do.

239
00:16:20,066 --> 00:16:22,166
I just can't stand this guy!

240
00:16:22,266 --> 00:16:23,766
[Tsunoda] I hate him!

241
00:16:23,866 --> 00:16:25,533
Sheez...

242
00:16:25,633 --> 00:16:26,866
[Takashi] Why?

243
00:16:26,966 --> 00:16:29,466
What the hell did I ever do to
you? I don't even know you.

244
00:16:29,566 --> 00:16:31,400
You know!

245
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,166
[Rei] Asshole.

246
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:45,933
[clapping]

247
00:16:46,033 --> 00:16:47,933
[Shido] Bravo!

248
00:16:48,033 --> 00:16:50,866
Simply outstanding teamwork.

249
00:16:50,966 --> 00:16:53,433
I'm impressed.
I commend both of you.

250
00:16:53,533 --> 00:16:57,166
[Shido] At any rate, a conflict
like that only proves my point.

251
00:16:57,266 --> 00:17:00,200
We need a leader. We do.

252
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:05,566
Surely neither of you want such
a difficult responsibility on
your shoulders.

253
00:17:05,666 --> 00:17:08,800
So, you're going to run for
the position then?

254
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:10,266
I'm a teacher, Miss Takagi.

255
00:17:10,366 --> 00:17:13,900
And while mature, all of you
are barely in your teens.

256
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,466
That alone makes it very clear
who's more qualified to assume
such a role.

257
00:17:18,566 --> 00:17:24,266
I have experience. Why just
moments ago, I saved all of
these brave students!

258
00:17:24,366 --> 00:17:27,200
[Shido] What do you say, guys?

259
00:17:38,766 --> 00:17:45,600
There, it's been decided. The
majority seems to have made the
choice quite clear, yes?

260
00:17:57,090 --> 00:17:59,023
[Takashi] Rei!

261
00:17:59,756 --> 00:18:01,590
No way! I won't do it!

262
00:18:01,690 --> 00:18:04,923
I'm not staying here with him!

263
00:18:05,023 --> 00:18:06,623
[Takashi] Get back in the bus...

264
00:18:07,956 --> 00:18:09,456
Well, there's nothing
I can do...

265
00:18:09,556 --> 00:18:12,156
if you don't want to act in
accordance with all of us.

266
00:18:12,256 --> 00:18:15,123
What "us"? What are you
talking about?!

[Takashi] Wait!

270
00:18:20,256 --> 00:18:22,856
Get back on the bus. When we get
to the city, we'll get off.

271
00:18:22,956 --> 00:18:24,156
I don't want you to leave!

272
00:18:24,256 --> 00:18:26,723
That's why I told you that
you'd regret this!

273
00:18:26,823 --> 00:18:28,356
No! We'll both regret this!

Wha‐ Huh?

277
00:19:02,039 --> 00:19:03,672
[Takashi] So much for gettin'
back on the bus...

[Takashi] At the police station!

280
00:19:17,105 --> 00:19:20,205
Meet up at the east
police station.

281
00:19:20,305 --> 00:19:21,639
What time?

282
00:19:21,739 --> 00:19:23,839
[Takashi] 7 o'clock.

283
00:19:23,939 --> 00:19:27,472
If not today, then tomorrow
at the same time.

284
00:19:40,039 --> 00:19:42,372
Looks like we're not taking
this freeway anymore.

285
00:19:42,472 --> 00:19:46,072
Okay, I'll turn around and
find another way.

[Rei] Are we going to walk
to the city?

[Takashi] If there's no
other way.

Get on.
