1
00:00:04,633 --> 00:00:07,400
[copilot] I finished checking
on the passengers.

2
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:13,166
We don't have anyone who's
injured or has a high fever.

3
00:00:13,266 --> 00:00:17,000
[copilot] Or who's already dead.

4
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:20,966
Your family, they're all in
Tokyo, aren't they?

5
00:00:21,066 --> 00:00:23,733
No one's answered any
of my calls.

6
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:30,333
[copilot] Tokonosu Tower,
JX089 ready to take off.

7
00:00:30,433 --> 00:00:37,166
JX089, Tokonosu Tower, uh you
might want to keep us on
runway status.

8
00:00:37,266 --> 00:00:39,000
We have a little bit of a...

9
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:41,166
problem.

10
00:02:31,733 --> 00:02:33,933
[Rika] What a scumbag.

11
00:02:34,033 --> 00:02:35,233
He's an actor.

12
00:02:35,333 --> 00:02:38,333
He came from Tokonosu for
shooting the film.

13
00:02:38,433 --> 00:02:40,766
Distance 4500.

14
00:02:40,866 --> 00:02:42,566
[Tajima] Angle of elevation
minus six,

15
00:02:42,666 --> 00:02:46,600
almost no wind, no need for
correction.

16
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:49,600
All right, looks like you've
got a green light.

17
00:02:56,933 --> 00:02:58,266
[bang]

18
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:05,033
[gun fire]

19
00:03:07,966 --> 00:03:09,733
[Tajima] Bravo!

20
00:03:09,833 --> 00:03:13,300
Confirming all targets on the
runway are now neutralized.

21
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,366
Over.

22
00:03:14,466 --> 00:03:16,066
[sigh]

23
00:03:16,866 --> 00:03:18,366
What are you doing?

24
00:03:18,466 --> 00:03:21,066
I've been laying on my
boobs all morning.

25
00:03:21,166 --> 00:03:23,533
They feel almost numb.

26
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:29,100
You know I can massage
'em for you.

27
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:32,366
I'd let you if you were a
better sniper than me.

28
00:03:32,466 --> 00:03:36,166
Oh come on! You're one of
the top five shooters in
the force!

29
00:03:36,266 --> 00:03:37,833
What do I rank? Fifteen?

30
00:03:37,933 --> 00:03:40,266
Guess you're not feeling
them then.

31
00:03:40,366 --> 00:03:42,066
[Tajima] So how do you think
they got here?

32
00:03:42,166 --> 00:03:46,866
I mean this is an airport on an
island. You can only get here
by boat.

33
00:03:46,966 --> 00:03:48,866
They've been restricting
the entry, right?

34
00:03:48,966 --> 00:03:50,300
[Rika] Only important officials,

35
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,966
and technicians they need
to maintain the airport,

36
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:55,200
and their family members.

37
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:57,633
Someone among them must have
gotten infected.

38
00:03:57,733 --> 00:04:03,066
It's not that bad right now,
but we don't know how long it
stays that way.

39
00:04:05,666 --> 00:04:09,900
[Tajima] Who knows what
would've happened if they
wouldn't have had us come along?

40
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,366
These guys would've been fucked.

41
00:04:12,466 --> 00:04:17,166
Although, it's not like we have
an endless supply of bullets
or anything.

42
00:04:17,266 --> 00:04:19,766
So, you're going to run away?

43
00:04:19,866 --> 00:04:21,566
[Tajima] No, I'm not.

44
00:04:21,666 --> 00:04:24,000
At least, not yet.

45
00:04:29,866 --> 00:04:31,733
[Rika] I'm going to the city.

46
00:04:32,566 --> 00:04:34,000
Sooner or later.

47
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:36,300
[Tajima] You got a boyfriend
or something?

48
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,600
[Rika] I've got a friend there.

49
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:40,266
[traffic]

50
00:04:40,366 --> 00:04:44,566
[Shido] Exactly, that's why
we should secure a safe
place first,

51
00:04:44,666 --> 00:04:50,000
then make moves together
rather than making random
moves on our own.

52
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:52,566
Isn't that why you voted
a leader?

53
00:04:52,666 --> 00:04:56,100
[Shido] Truly we should wait
until we're ready to act as
a disciplined group...

54
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:58,933
to confirm the safety of our
family members.

55
00:04:59,033 --> 00:05:00,633
Going off half cocked on
our own...

56
00:05:00,733 --> 00:05:03,733
[Saya] Hirano! Stop.
[Shido] will only lead
to inevitable tragedy.

57
00:05:03,833 --> 00:05:05,366
Takagi... Morning.

58
00:05:05,466 --> 00:05:06,900
Is it time to get up already?

59
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,766
Yes, it's morning.

60
00:05:08,866 --> 00:05:11,066
Ugh and you're drooling.

61
00:05:12,466 --> 00:05:13,666
Sorry...

62
00:05:14,766 --> 00:05:16,666
[Kota] Look at that.

63
00:05:20,466 --> 00:05:24,100
I think it's better to evacuate
to the suburbs.

64
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:27,600
Cars are not the only way
to get outta here.

65
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:30,733
[Kota] The airport on
the ocean! You're right!

66
00:05:30,833 --> 00:05:33,700
It's far too dangerous to be
anywhere in the city.

67
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:36,733
I bet a bunch of people are
trying to escape to some island,

68
00:05:36,833 --> 00:05:41,733
or some isolated area with some
kind of strong military presence
or something.

69
00:05:41,833 --> 00:05:43,533
Like, Okinawa?

70
00:05:43,633 --> 00:05:47,800
But the American military
that's stationed there isn't
there to fight...

71
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:49,666
Oh! But there's
Self‐Defense Forces.

72
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:52,133
If the military has taken
appropriate measures,

73
00:05:52,233 --> 00:05:55,633
then I'm betting Hokkaido or
Kyushu should be okay too.

74
00:05:55,733 --> 00:05:59,566
If planes are leaving, then all
the flights are heading to
those areas.

75
00:05:59,666 --> 00:06:02,633
So you think maybe we should
head that way too?

76
00:06:02,733 --> 00:06:05,700
[Saya] It's too late!

77
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:08,566
The areas with a heavy presence
of Self‐Defense Forces...

78
00:06:08,666 --> 00:06:12,466
and American military may
be managing to keep Them
under control,

79
00:06:12,566 --> 00:06:18,366
but I'm sure they've already
started to adopt a stern policy
toward letting anybody else in.

80
00:06:18,466 --> 00:06:22,700
No, sooner or later, it's going
to be that way everywhere in
the world.

81
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,000
I mean what would you do in the
same situation?

82
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:29,566
[Kota] I'd seclude myself.

83
00:06:29,666 --> 00:06:34,000
What would happen if everyone
in this world starts thinking
that way?

84
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:41,266
What if they start focusing
only on keeping their community
as small as possible in order
to survive?

85
00:06:41,366 --> 00:06:44,866
You really ask some very
relevant questions, you
know that?

86
00:06:44,966 --> 00:06:46,800
What are you talking about?

87
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:48,000
Look at him.

88
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:51,400
[Saya] You can already see
that in him.

89
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:55,266
Although, I doubt that he
knows it himself.

90
00:06:55,366 --> 00:06:58,700
You know, this all
happened overnight.

91
00:06:59,733 --> 00:07:01,333
Should I interrupt them?

92
00:07:01,433 --> 00:07:06,133
Forget the pervy teacher and
slutty little Sally over there.

93
00:07:06,233 --> 00:07:09,333
I should consult with someone
that I can trust.

94
00:07:09,433 --> 00:07:13,066
Jeez, I could have talked
to Komuro if he were here!

95
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:17,000
Yeah, you like Komuro. I know.

96
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:19,166
Don't be ridiculous!

97
00:07:21,766 --> 00:07:23,000
[sigh]

98
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:25,266
[Saya] What?!

99
00:07:25,366 --> 00:07:29,533
I'm getting worried about Komuro
and the others.

100
00:07:29,633 --> 00:07:32,700
[Saeko] I hope they can hold
on till we meet up.

101
00:07:34,666 --> 00:07:36,766
[boom]

102
00:07:36,866 --> 00:07:38,933
[screaming]

103
00:07:39,033 --> 00:07:40,733
[gunshot]

104
00:07:40,833 --> 00:07:42,800
[laughing]

105
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:44,633
That's right, you run!

106
00:07:44,733 --> 00:07:46,733
All of you, run like Hell!

107
00:07:48,733 --> 00:07:50,833
[gunfire]

108
00:07:50,933 --> 00:07:52,700
[Rei] This is absolutely nuts.

109
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,300
It's like a war.

110
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:57,866
And we're front row, center
for it.

111
00:07:57,966 --> 00:07:59,400
Dangerous place to be.
[engine revving]

112
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,466
Hold on tight.

113
00:08:06,866 --> 00:08:09,033
Hey!

114
00:08:11,066 --> 00:08:13,166
Hold on to me, Rei!

115
00:08:20,033 --> 00:08:21,366
[gunshot]

116
00:08:23,133 --> 00:08:26,866
We're not dead! Why are these
maniacs shooting at us?!

117
00:08:26,966 --> 00:08:29,666
The whole world's going
crazy, Rei.

118
00:08:29,766 --> 00:08:32,266
We can't trust anyone.

119
00:08:32,366 --> 00:08:34,500
We can't trust anyone...

120
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:44,666
What? The bridge is
straight ahead!

121
00:08:46,866 --> 00:08:50,900
I know, but did you see it?

122
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,166
[Takashi] At this rate,
we don't know when we'll
be able to cross.

123
00:08:54,266 --> 00:08:58,466
We'll head to Onbetsu Bridge
and meet up with the teachers
and the others.

124
00:09:03,066 --> 00:09:05,533
[screaming]

125
00:09:09,733 --> 00:09:13,766
[police] I repeat! We want
everyone to follow the police
officers' directions...

126
00:09:13,866 --> 00:09:15,433
and proceed calmly!

127
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:21,533
The entire city is under
traffic restriction.

128
00:09:21,633 --> 00:09:26,266
Anyone who tries to cross the
river without permission will
be stopped.

129
00:09:26,366 --> 00:09:29,633
Crossing the river by foot
is not permitted.

130
00:09:29,733 --> 00:09:32,400
[rattle]

131
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:33,400
Come back here!

132
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:35,033
[rattle]

133
00:09:35,133 --> 00:09:37,466
Did you just look up her dress?

134
00:09:39,733 --> 00:09:41,033
Move, bitch!

135
00:09:41,133 --> 00:09:42,900
So annoying, you old hag!

136
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,133
Get outta the way!

137
00:09:44,233 --> 00:09:47,033
[police] You, over there!
Get back now!

138
00:09:47,133 --> 00:09:49,266
Do not try to cross the bridge!

139
00:09:49,366 --> 00:09:50,933
This is the last warning!

140
00:09:51,033 --> 00:09:52,266
Give me a break!

141
00:09:52,366 --> 00:09:54,533
Who's gonna listen to a bunch
of stupid cops?

142
00:09:54,633 --> 00:09:57,766
It's every man for himself
these days, asshole!

143
00:09:57,866 --> 00:10:01,033
You're so cool, Hide‐chan!

144
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:04,100
[police] Use the water!

145
00:10:09,766 --> 00:10:11,633
I‐ w‐what?

146
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:18,066
There must be some mistake!
I was just going along to
be safe!

147
00:10:18,966 --> 00:10:20,466
[police] Blast them!

148
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:27,233
[Shido] I know we're
no longer in school,

149
00:10:27,333 --> 00:10:30,166
but I hope that you would
all continue to live with
the pride...

150
00:10:30,266 --> 00:10:33,733
your school has instilled in
each and every one of you!

151
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:50,548
[Shido] Pride of unity! It is
that pride that will keep
us together!

152
00:10:50,648 --> 00:10:54,481
Not vainglorious pride in
ourselves, but pride as a
group, a family!

153
00:10:54,581 --> 00:10:58,114
And realize this, my dear
friends! Komuro and Miyamoto...

154
00:10:58,214 --> 00:11:00,914
were unfit to be in our family!

155
00:11:01,014 --> 00:11:02,814
This guy's a God damn maniac.

156
00:11:02,914 --> 00:11:04,781
[Saeko] You got that right.
[Shido] We must stand together
in order to survive!

157
00:11:04,881 --> 00:11:08,348
Sounds like he's a recruiter
for some kind of cult
religious group.

158
00:11:08,448 --> 00:11:11,414
He doesn't just sound
like it; it <i>is.</i>

159
00:11:11,514 --> 00:11:15,581
[Saya] And look at the
slobbering idiots hinging
on his every word.

160
00:11:15,681 --> 00:11:17,514
Like a bunch of
Scientologists...

161
00:11:17,614 --> 00:11:22,114
Or rather, Shido‐tologists.
I need to get out of here.

162
00:11:22,214 --> 00:11:24,014
Given the condition
on the road,

163
00:11:24,114 --> 00:11:27,114
Looks like we're going to have
to give up our ride.

164
00:11:27,214 --> 00:11:31,714
We have to somehow get across
Onbetsu Bridge and head to the
east police station.

165
00:11:31,814 --> 00:11:34,248
We're still supposed to meet
up with Komuro.

166
00:11:34,348 --> 00:11:37,181
You're sure quite concerned
about Komuro, aren't you?

167
00:11:37,281 --> 00:11:40,714
Aren't you worried about your
own family?

168
00:11:40,814 --> 00:11:46,214
Course I am, but my father is my
only family, and he's at the
dojo overseas.

169
00:11:46,314 --> 00:11:49,414
So the only people I really need
to be worrying about right now,

170
00:11:49,514 --> 00:11:53,814
is myself and Komuro. I really
don't care about anybody else.

171
00:11:53,914 --> 00:11:58,814
And just look at me. I mean,
seriously, if any of us are
going to make it out of here
alive...

172
00:11:58,914 --> 00:12:00,481
it's going to be me, right?

173
00:12:00,581 --> 00:12:02,081
[nervous laughter]

174
00:12:02,181 --> 00:12:04,648
So, where is everyone's house?

175
00:12:04,748 --> 00:12:08,181
The other side of the
bridge; the same area
with Komuro's.

176
00:12:08,281 --> 00:12:11,848
[Kota] Oh, my parents are not
in the neighborhood,

177
00:12:11,948 --> 00:12:16,081
but I‐I'd go anywhere as long
as I'm with Takagi.

178
00:12:16,181 --> 00:12:17,148
<i>Eeew!</i>

179
00:12:17,248 --> 00:12:19,348
So tell me, Hirano,
where's your family?

180
00:12:19,448 --> 00:12:20,214
They close?

181
00:12:20,314 --> 00:12:22,014
My father is a jewelry merchant,

182
00:12:22,114 --> 00:12:24,648
so he's gone to Amsterdam
to buy stones.

183
00:12:24,748 --> 00:12:26,114
My mother is a fashion designer,

184
00:12:26,214 --> 00:12:28,314
so she's been staying
in Paris, to‐

185
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:31,348
Christ! Do you expect us to
believe all that crap?!

186
00:12:32,614 --> 00:12:34,214
And if it were a manga,

187
00:12:34,314 --> 00:12:37,848
Daddy would be the captain
of a cruise ship, a giant
luxury liner!

188
00:12:37,948 --> 00:12:39,348
My grandpa actually was.

189
00:12:39,448 --> 00:12:43,548
And my grandmother was a
concert violinist.

190
00:12:43,648 --> 00:12:46,948
[Saya] <i>Ugh, why couldn't he be</i>
<i>better looking?</i>

191
00:12:47,048 --> 00:12:49,114
[Shizuka] So, what are we
going to do?

192
00:12:49,214 --> 00:12:51,381
I want to come along with
all of you.

193
00:12:51,481 --> 00:12:52,448
[Saya] Are you sure?

194
00:12:52,548 --> 00:12:54,814
Both of my parents passed
away years ago,

195
00:12:54,914 --> 00:12:57,548
and my relatives live far away.

196
00:12:57,648 --> 00:12:59,114
I know I shouldn't be
saying this,

197
00:12:59,214 --> 00:13:03,414
but I... I think Mr. Shido
is kind of a douchebag.

198
00:13:05,481 --> 00:13:06,348
So, what do we do?

199
00:13:06,448 --> 00:13:08,814
I'm not very familiar with
this area.

200
00:13:08,914 --> 00:13:11,948
We really need to check on
Onbetsu Bridge first.

201
00:13:12,048 --> 00:13:14,681
Um, what's the matter, everyone?

202
00:13:14,781 --> 00:13:17,148
[Shido] We need to work
together, otherwise none
of us are ever‐

203
00:13:17,248 --> 00:13:20,281
Thanks for the offer, but I'm
gonna pass, Mr. Shido.

204
00:13:20,381 --> 00:13:23,548
We've got our own plans.
And FYI, this is no field trip.

205
00:13:23,648 --> 00:13:28,614
[Saya] I have no obligation
to be with you. I never had
any classes with you anyway.

206
00:13:29,648 --> 00:13:31,481
I see...

207
00:13:36,381 --> 00:13:40,081
If that's what you've decided,
go right ahead. I won't stop
you, Takagi.

208
00:13:40,181 --> 00:13:47,381
How could I? This is a free
country, not some sort of
iron‐fisted dictatorship.

209
00:13:47,481 --> 00:13:49,281
However...

210
00:13:50,948 --> 00:13:55,681
I'm afraid you will have
to remain, Miss Marikawa.

211
00:13:55,781 --> 00:14:00,448
[Shido] Losing the doctor
is a major blow to our
current situation.

212
00:14:01,814 --> 00:14:05,014
Would you please stay?
What do you say?

213
00:14:05,114 --> 00:14:09,414
[Shido] There are students
who are relying on you.

214
00:14:10,314 --> 00:14:11,448
[bang]

215
00:14:15,414 --> 00:14:17,748
Y‐You shot at me!

216
00:14:17,848 --> 00:14:19,381
[Kota] I missed you on purpose.

217
00:14:19,481 --> 00:14:21,114
You douchebag.

218
00:14:21,214 --> 00:14:23,614
But y‐you're not a violent
student like that...

219
00:14:23,714 --> 00:14:28,281
How many of my fellow students
do you think I killed in
school yesterday?

220
00:14:28,381 --> 00:14:34,548
And I could kill you too
for all the ways you always
made fun of me!

221
00:14:35,681 --> 00:14:37,281
[Kota] I was holding back...

222
00:14:37,381 --> 00:14:40,114
I was holding back for a
long time!

223
00:14:40,214 --> 00:14:44,181
I was holding it back because
I just wanted to have a
normal life!

224
00:14:44,281 --> 00:14:47,214
But there's no need to do
that anymore!

225
00:14:48,648 --> 00:14:51,514
Nothing we know is
normal anymore!

226
00:14:51,614 --> 00:14:55,714
That's why I'm able to kill now.

227
00:14:55,814 --> 00:14:59,314
I can even kill living
people too.

228
00:14:59,414 --> 00:15:02,448
Maybe start by the ones who
made fun of me!

229
00:15:02,548 --> 00:15:07,714
I made fun? You misunderstood!
I've always held you in such
high esteem!

230
00:15:07,814 --> 00:15:10,748
If you want to go,
now's the time to do it.

231
00:15:10,848 --> 00:15:13,281
I'll make sure he doesn't
stop you!

232
00:15:15,614 --> 00:15:18,848
You're such a man,
I'm impressed.

233
00:15:25,448 --> 00:15:27,314
Mr. Shido?

234
00:15:31,248 --> 00:15:33,848
[Rei] It's the same here.

235
00:15:33,948 --> 00:15:35,181
What should we do?

236
00:15:35,281 --> 00:15:37,148
Should we try a different
bridge or something?

237
00:15:37,248 --> 00:15:38,914
I'm sure they're all the same.

238
00:15:39,014 --> 00:15:41,448
Probably every bridge
is blocked.

239
00:15:41,548 --> 00:15:45,148
[Takashi] What's the point of
policing unless they block Them?

240
00:15:46,581 --> 00:15:48,248
Damnit.

241
00:15:48,348 --> 00:15:52,014
We need to cross the bridge and
get to the east police station
by 7:00.

242
00:15:52,114 --> 00:15:56,181
[Rei] How? That's a little
easier said than done.

243
00:15:56,281 --> 00:15:59,314
[Takashi] Give me a sec,
I'm thinking!

244
00:15:59,414 --> 00:16:00,581
I wish there were...

245
00:16:00,681 --> 00:16:03,648
Well there isn't!

246
00:16:03,748 --> 00:16:06,048
So there's no use
bringing it up.

247
00:16:07,148 --> 00:16:07,714
[bang]

248
00:16:07,814 --> 00:16:09,014
Gunshot?!

249
00:16:09,114 --> 00:16:11,481
No, it... that was a...

250
00:16:11,581 --> 00:16:16,748
Um, hey, maybe we were better
off staying on the bus with
Mr. Shido.

251
00:16:16,848 --> 00:16:18,681
[Shizuka] Just throwing that
out there.

252
00:16:18,781 --> 00:16:21,881
Hold on, weren't you the one
who said that you thought he
was a douchebag?

253
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:28,181
As a matter of fact, I did,
but he wouldn't be the first
douchebag I was stuck on a
bus with.

254
00:16:29,714 --> 00:16:33,214
Just to let you know,
I'm running out of the nails!

255
00:16:37,581 --> 00:16:39,214
Do you want to borrow this?

256
00:16:39,314 --> 00:16:42,548
I really don't do
hand‐to‐hand combat.

257
00:16:42,648 --> 00:16:45,048
I can't say the same...

258
00:16:45,848 --> 00:16:48,448
I'm actually quite fond of it!

259
00:16:52,648 --> 00:16:53,914
Wait a minute!

260
00:16:54,014 --> 00:16:55,514
[Rei] Are you nuts?!

261
00:17:00,381 --> 00:17:02,248
[Shizuka] No!

262
00:17:03,614 --> 00:17:05,048
Takagi!

263
00:17:05,148 --> 00:17:06,948
Oh no!

264
00:17:11,714 --> 00:17:13,481
[in unison] Holy shit!

265
00:17:32,181 --> 00:17:33,948
Hirano!

266
00:17:43,881 --> 00:17:46,214
Double‐tap, baby!

267
00:17:53,814 --> 00:17:55,548
Give me your hand!

268
00:18:05,981 --> 00:18:08,314
[Shizuka] Amazing...

269
00:18:08,414 --> 00:18:12,281
[Saeko] Looks like it's all
cleared for now.

270
00:18:14,948 --> 00:18:16,248
They sure were tough to beat.

271
00:18:16,348 --> 00:18:19,048
Tough for everybody but
you maybe.

272
00:18:19,148 --> 00:18:21,414
[Rei] Miss Shizuka!

273
00:18:21,514 --> 00:18:25,881
[Shizuka] Oh, Miyamoto,
what a coincident!

274
00:18:25,981 --> 00:18:27,814
[muffled]
That's, "what a coincidence".

275
00:18:27,914 --> 00:18:30,014
You too, Komuro!

276
00:18:30,114 --> 00:18:33,081
[Saeko] This must mean that
Tokonosu Bridge is also blocked.

277
00:18:33,181 --> 00:18:35,648
Right, there's no way out.

278
00:18:35,748 --> 00:18:36,914
I have to confess,

279
00:18:37,014 --> 00:18:39,214
I'm really glad that you're
okay, Komuro.

280
00:18:39,314 --> 00:18:42,214
[Takashi]
Glad you're all right too.

281
00:18:42,314 --> 00:18:44,014
What about me?

282
00:18:44,114 --> 00:18:46,781
I'm glad you're okay too,
all of you.

283
00:18:46,881 --> 00:18:48,614
What are you doing?

284
00:18:48,714 --> 00:18:50,614
Komuro, what is this?!

285
00:18:50,714 --> 00:18:51,614
How did you get it?

286
00:18:51,714 --> 00:18:52,948
Where are the extra bullets?

287
00:18:53,048 --> 00:18:54,648
[Kota] This is Smith & Wesson's
M37 Airweight,

288
00:18:54,748 --> 00:18:55,881
that the police use, right?

289
00:18:55,981 --> 00:18:57,314
[Takashi] I'll tell you about
it later.

290
00:18:57,414 --> 00:18:59,548
[Kota] Oh man! Feel the weight!
How good it feels!

291
00:19:01,414 --> 00:19:03,981
[Saeko] We got off the bus
because the road was blocked,

292
00:19:04,081 --> 00:19:08,281
but we haven't been able to
cross the river.

293
00:19:08,381 --> 00:19:13,014
[Saya] The water has risen,
so going further upstream
won't help, I guess.

294
00:19:13,114 --> 00:19:14,948
[Rei] Then, what should we do?

295
00:19:15,048 --> 00:19:16,914
I have a thought.
It's been such a stressful day,

296
00:19:17,014 --> 00:19:19,014
why don't we just
call it quits for now?

297
00:19:19,114 --> 00:19:21,214
[Kota] C‐Call it a day?

298
00:19:21,314 --> 00:19:26,081
Why yes. My friend's flat is
nearby. It's just a short walk
from here.

299
00:19:26,181 --> 00:19:27,748
[Saya] Your boyfriend's place?

300
00:19:27,848 --> 00:19:30,248
Oh no, no, no, no!
It's nothing like that!

301
00:19:30,348 --> 00:19:32,181
It's just my girl
friend's apartment.

302
00:19:32,281 --> 00:19:34,748
She's always busy working
and traveling with her job.

303
00:19:34,848 --> 00:19:39,748
She gave me the key so I could
go there and look after the
place when she's away.

304
00:19:39,848 --> 00:19:43,648
Have a nice day!

305
00:19:43,748 --> 00:19:44,948
Is it a high‐rise?

306
00:19:45,048 --> 00:19:47,314
Does it have a good view
of the surroundings?

307
00:19:47,414 --> 00:19:48,348
Oh, yeah!

308
00:19:48,448 --> 00:19:51,014
It's a duplex,
standing along the river.

309
00:19:51,114 --> 00:19:53,281
There's a convenience store
nearby too.

310
00:19:53,381 --> 00:19:56,714
Oh, and a car! You know, that
one that looks like a tank.

311
00:19:56,814 --> 00:19:58,481
The thing that drinks gas?

312
00:19:58,581 --> 00:20:00,848
Big! The really big one!

313
00:20:00,948 --> 00:20:03,548
I don't care about a car
as much as a shower.

314
00:20:03,648 --> 00:20:06,981
I don't think I've ever felt
dirtier in my life.

315
00:20:07,081 --> 00:20:09,314
I couldn't agree with you more.

316
00:20:09,414 --> 00:20:10,381
[thud]

317
00:20:10,481 --> 00:20:12,381
What do you mean by that?!

318
00:20:12,481 --> 00:20:14,848
[Takashi]
I'll go check on it with her.

319
00:20:14,948 --> 00:20:16,714
Come on, let's go.

320
00:20:16,814 --> 00:20:18,581
[Shizuka] Oh, okay.

321
00:20:23,714 --> 00:20:28,081
[Shizuka] Oh! It's been so
long since I've felt
something like this!

322
00:20:28,181 --> 00:20:32,614
Um, you're talking about the
motorcycle aren't you?

323
00:20:32,714 --> 00:20:34,448
What? What did you say?

324
00:20:34,548 --> 00:20:36,248
I can't hear you!

325
00:20:36,348 --> 00:20:37,748
[Takashi] I‐I was just saying...

326
00:20:37,848 --> 00:20:39,581
[Shizuka] I can't hear you!

327
00:20:39,681 --> 00:20:40,881
[Takashi] I just said...

328
00:20:40,981 --> 00:20:43,014
[Shizuka] I can't hear you!

329
00:20:43,114 --> 00:20:46,148
[Takashi] I said‐!

330
00:22:26,348 --> 00:22:29,814
[Kota] A Hum‐Vee! It's the
military model too!

331
00:22:29,914 --> 00:22:32,281
Told you.
It looks like a tank, right?

332
00:22:32,381 --> 00:22:34,981
Exactly what kind
of friend is she?

333
00:22:35,081 --> 00:22:37,581
I bet They can't jump over
the fence,

334
00:22:37,681 --> 00:22:40,848
so we should be able to have a
good night's sleep.

335
00:22:40,948 --> 00:22:42,381
Let's hurry up and‐

336
00:22:42,481 --> 00:22:44,981
[groan]

337
00:22:47,714 --> 00:22:49,948
Komuro, will this work?

338
00:22:50,048 --> 00:22:51,748
Yeah, good enough.

339
00:22:51,848 --> 00:22:53,181
Stay back.

340
00:22:54,381 --> 00:22:57,448
Don't take chances and be
sure to cover for each other.

341
00:22:57,548 --> 00:22:59,548
[Takashi] Let's go!

342
00:23:00,448 --> 00:23:01,948
<i>Looking back on it,</i>

343
00:23:02,048 --> 00:23:05,148
<i>it seemed like that's when</i>
<i>we all changed.</i>

344
00:23:06,114 --> 00:23:10,048
<i>We weren't just running</i>
<i>away anymore.</i>

345
00:23:10,148 --> 00:23:13,714
<i>We were attacking first</i>
<i>to survive.</i>

346
00:23:13,814 --> 00:23:15,714
<i>We didn't question it.</i>

347
00:23:15,814 --> 00:23:17,948
<i>It just became instinct.</i>

348
00:23:18,048 --> 00:23:21,081
<i>And it became the only thing</i>
<i>we knew.</i>

349
00:23:22,048 --> 00:23:24,148
<i>It didn't take that long...</i>
