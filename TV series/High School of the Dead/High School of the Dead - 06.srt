1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,500
[bang]

2
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:12,233
[reporter] The so‐called
"killing pandemic"

3
00:00:12,333 --> 00:00:16,400
that's been occuring all
over the world continues to
spread with unprecedented speed.

4
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:20,900
The number of the patients of
this killing pandemic in our
country has already reached
over two million.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,966
[growling]
[reporter] Because of its
powerful infectiousness and the
paralyzed system,

6
00:00:26,066 --> 00:00:30,133
it's speculated that the number
could reach ten million within
a day or two.

7
00:00:30,233 --> 00:00:34,466
And centers for disease control
appear to be stymied.

8
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:40,833
[Saya] Are you looking at me?
[Rei] Oh come on, don't be
such a prude.

9
00:00:40,933 --> 00:00:43,033
[reporter] ...in an effort to
keep the station on the air,

10
00:00:43,133 --> 00:00:48,195
have decided to take the
broadcasting team to an
undisclosed offshore facility.

11
00:00:50,333 --> 00:00:53,266
[reporter] Unfortunately,
this is going to be the
last broadcasting as a
scheduled program.

12
00:00:53,366 --> 00:00:55,266
[Saya] Come on!
[Shizuka] Miss Miyamoto!
[Rei] Hurry up!

13
00:00:55,366 --> 00:00:58,066
[reporter] Goodbye, everyone,
and good luck.

14
00:02:38,666 --> 00:02:39,833
It feels nice.

15
00:02:39,933 --> 00:02:42,733
[Shizuka] It feels like I'm
melting away!

16
00:02:45,733 --> 00:02:48,500
This is shampoo, right?

17
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:52,700
[Rei] Good God, you're gigantic!

18
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,866
I know, I get that a lot.

19
00:02:55,966 --> 00:02:58,400
Almost impossibly gigantic.

20
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:01,000
[Rei] Here! Let me see those
things. They can't be real!

21
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:03,133
[Shizuka] Ah! Stop it
Miss Miyamoto!

22
00:03:03,233 --> 00:03:05,833
Oh no! No, they're‐ oh!
Give me a break!

23
00:03:05,933 --> 00:03:08,400
[Rei] Wait a minute, they don't
feel fake.
[Saya] Good God.

24
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:13,066
[Saya] So, what? We all just had
to take a bath at the same time?

25
00:03:13,166 --> 00:03:15,766
But you know why, don't
you, Takagi?

26
00:03:15,866 --> 00:03:18,333
Yeah, I guess so.

27
00:03:19,766 --> 00:03:22,233
[Saya] But considering the
current situation that we
are in,

28
00:03:22,333 --> 00:03:24,866
I don't think we should be
doing stuff like this.

29
00:03:24,966 --> 00:03:26,333
[shriek]

30
00:03:28,266 --> 00:03:31,233
[Saeko] That voice is better
than I thought it would be.

31
00:03:31,333 --> 00:03:34,933
Boys must love your sexy voice.

32
00:03:35,033 --> 00:03:36,366
Ah!

33
00:03:42,733 --> 00:03:45,933
[Saya] <i>Don't look at me like</i>
<i>that, you're the one who</i>
<i>started it.</i>

34
00:03:46,033 --> 00:03:47,466
[giggling]

35
00:03:47,566 --> 00:03:49,266
[Takashi] Sounds like they're
having fun.

36
00:03:49,366 --> 00:03:50,833
[Kota] You want to go have
a peek?

37
00:03:50,933 --> 00:03:52,633
You know we're supposed to,
right?

38
00:03:52,733 --> 00:03:54,866
I don't want to die just yet.

39
00:03:54,966 --> 00:03:57,933
[Takashi] And I'm gonna be
really pissed off if there's
nothing in here.

40
00:03:58,033 --> 00:03:59,533
[Kota] There has to be.

41
00:03:59,633 --> 00:04:02,433
We found the ammunition,
so there has to be something
in here.

42
00:04:02,533 --> 00:04:04,333
[Takashi] Oh well,
it doesn't matter.

43
00:04:04,433 --> 00:04:05,800
Let's do it!

44
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:06,800
[in unison] One...

45
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:09,366
...two, three!

46
00:04:13,366 --> 00:04:14,766
Man...

47
00:04:16,666 --> 00:04:18,233
[Takashi] Hello!

48
00:04:18,333 --> 00:04:19,900
What?

49
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,333
[crazed laughter]

50
00:04:22,133 --> 00:04:24,033
I just knew it!

51
00:04:24,133 --> 00:04:27,633
[Takashi] So she lives here
with a friend of hers,
isn't that right?

52
00:04:27,733 --> 00:04:30,633
Who is she? Sarah fucking Palin?

53
00:04:30,733 --> 00:04:32,300
[sneeze]

54
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,433
[Tajima] What's the matter?

55
00:04:33,533 --> 00:04:35,933
[Rika] Someone's talking
about me.

56
00:04:36,033 --> 00:04:38,066
[Tajima] What?

57
00:04:38,166 --> 00:04:41,333
Not a lot of friends,
so it's probably...

58
00:04:44,933 --> 00:04:47,866
Springfield M1A1, Super Match.

59
00:04:47,966 --> 00:04:49,733
It's semi‐automatic,

60
00:04:49,833 --> 00:04:53,466
but the M14 series'
full‐automatic is nothing but
a waste of bullets anyway.

61
00:04:53,566 --> 00:04:54,600
Uh, chill out dude.

62
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:56,733
I can put twenty bullets in
the magazine!

63
00:04:56,833 --> 00:04:59,266
That's illegal in Japan.
Illegal!

64
00:04:59,366 --> 00:04:59,866
[laughter]

65
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:01,166
Hello, Hirano!

66
00:05:01,266 --> 00:05:03,300
[Kota] Knights SR‐25 rifle!

67
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,100
No, you can't get that in Japan,

68
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:08,100
so they just completely
modified an AR110?

69
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,566
[Kota] What's left in the locker
is a crossbow.

70
00:05:10,666 --> 00:05:13,466
It's a descendent of the one
Robin Hood used.

71
00:05:13,566 --> 00:05:15,133
Barnett Wildcat C5!

72
00:05:15,233 --> 00:05:18,266
Made in Britain, you can even
kill a bear with it!

73
00:05:19,333 --> 00:05:21,966
That's an eetha M37
riot shotgun!

74
00:05:22,066 --> 00:05:24,433
It's a super‐sick shotgun made
by Americans!

75
00:05:24,533 --> 00:05:26,966
It played a big part in the
Vietnam War too!

76
00:05:27,066 --> 00:05:30,733
I see...

77
00:05:30,833 --> 00:05:35,800
Are you nuts?! Don't point a
thing like that at anyone even
unloaded, but when you do...

78
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:38,400
shoot to kill.

79
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:41,566
Roger that.

80
00:05:41,666 --> 00:05:44,000
I hope that's the only thing
I need to point at.

81
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:45,266
You know...

82
00:05:45,366 --> 00:05:48,300
If it comes down to something
like that...

83
00:05:50,233 --> 00:05:54,966
If I happen to get bit, don't
you think twice about blasting
my head off.

84
00:05:55,066 --> 00:05:57,033
Yeah, same here.

85
00:05:57,133 --> 00:05:58,500
It's a deal!

86
00:05:59,633 --> 00:06:03,333
[Saeko] Ow!
[Rei] God, more big ones!

87
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,333
Will you help too, Komuro?

88
00:06:06,433 --> 00:06:08,800
It's a pain in the butt to put
the bullets in.

89
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:11,600
Did you practice with
airsoft guns?

90
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:14,066
No way, with the real ones.

91
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:16,533
What are you saying?
You've done this before?

92
00:06:16,633 --> 00:06:18,300
When I went to America...

93
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,133
[Kota] I was trained by
this instructor,

94
00:06:20,233 --> 00:06:25,133
who used to work for a private
military company, Black Water,
for a month.

95
00:06:25,233 --> 00:06:29,000
He's an ex‐captain of
Delta Force.

96
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:33,400
Oh my God, the class nerd's
a card carrying member of
the N. R. A.

97
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,733
I'm really glad we're
on the same side.

98
00:06:35,833 --> 00:06:37,500
Yeah.

99
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:41,466
[Takashi] And if that's your
secret life, what's this
chick's deal?

100
00:06:41,566 --> 00:06:44,033
These guns are definitely
illegal, aren't they?

101
00:06:44,133 --> 00:06:46,500
It's legal to purchase the
guns and parts.

102
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:49,666
But it is illegal if you put
them together in this way.

103
00:06:49,766 --> 00:06:52,433
Whoever lives here definitely
knows what they're doing.

104
00:06:52,533 --> 00:06:57,700
And that makes sense to me since
Miss Shizuka said her roommate
used to be in the military.

105
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:00,433
So you can get away with
anything as long as
you're a cop.

106
00:07:00,533 --> 00:07:03,366
[Kota] It's obvious the person
isn't an ordinary citizen.

107
00:07:03,466 --> 00:07:06,500
An unmarried police officer
usually lives in the dormitory,

108
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:09,900
but to think this person is
renting a room like this...

109
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,633
Either her parents are rich,

110
00:07:11,733 --> 00:07:13,400
or the man she's dating is rich,

111
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:17,033
or she's involved with some
funny business.

112
00:07:22,066 --> 00:07:24,166
They should probably hold it
down in there.

113
00:07:24,266 --> 00:07:26,000
[Takashi] It's okay.

114
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:31,066
I know they respond to what
they hear, but they're not
hearing the girls...

115
00:07:33,133 --> 00:07:36,066
If they are infected,
keep your distance from them!

116
00:07:36,166 --> 00:07:40,533
[cop] I repeat, if they show
signs of infection,
keep far from them!

117
00:07:40,633 --> 00:07:42,633
No one who is injured or shows
signs of infection...

118
00:07:42,733 --> 00:07:46,633
[reporter] The lockdown of the
west area of Tokonosu city is
still in effect.

119
00:07:46,733 --> 00:07:50,600
However, as this killing
pandemic has continued to
spread throughout the world,

120
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:53,300
some people are strongly
criticizing the lockdown,

121
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,633
questioning the necessity
of it.

122
00:07:55,733 --> 00:07:59,533
We came here to report on
this story, however, due to
this pandemic,

123
00:07:59,633 --> 00:08:02,266
we haven't been able to return
to the headquarters,

124
00:08:02,366 --> 00:08:04,633
which has been relocated
on the ocean.

125
00:08:04,733 --> 00:08:08,233
So as long as it's possible,
we'll continue to bring
you coverage.

126
00:08:08,333 --> 00:08:10,500
What do you mean we're free
to do whatever?

127
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:13,866
[captain] What about the
backup from the
Prefectural Headquarters?

128
00:08:13,966 --> 00:08:16,366
All communication has
been cut off?

129
00:08:16,466 --> 00:08:17,966
God damn it!

130
00:08:18,066 --> 00:08:21,733
Captain, at this rate,
they're going to break
through the barricade.

131
00:08:21,833 --> 00:08:23,700
Can't say I blame them.

132
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:28,933
We're too short‐handed. For
Christ's sake, they brought
in people from accounting.

133
00:08:29,033 --> 00:08:31,600
[officer] What do we do?

134
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:33,766
[captain] We've got a message
from upper management.

135
00:08:33,866 --> 00:08:37,400
They said we're allowed to
do anything in order to
maintain order.

136
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:40,266
Supposedly, things are crazy
down there too.

137
00:08:40,366 --> 00:08:42,366
The last order that they
received from headquarters...

138
00:08:42,466 --> 00:08:47,166
was to do whatever they could
do to control this mob.

139
00:08:47,266 --> 00:08:48,766
Then, give us an order now!

140
00:08:48,866 --> 00:08:51,700
If there are unharmed citizens
on the bridge or the other side,

141
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:56,300
we should sacrifice a small
group in order to save the
larger group!

142
00:08:57,933 --> 00:09:02,266
[captain] How ironic. Our job is
to protect these people...

143
00:09:03,966 --> 00:09:05,700
And you watch!

144
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:09,033
Now we're going to be forced
to kill most of them!

145
00:09:29,866 --> 00:09:31,733
[Takashi] I'm getting sick.

146
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:35,033
Here, I've had enough.

147
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:39,633
This reminds me of that scene
in <i>Apocalypse Now.</i>

148
00:09:39,733 --> 00:09:41,766
Huh? What's that?

149
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:44,200
[Takashi] What is it?

150
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:46,600
[Kota] Turn on the TV.

151
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:51,666
Don't tolerate the tyranny
of the police department!

152
00:09:51,766 --> 00:09:53,166
[crowd] Don't tolerate it!

153
00:09:53,266 --> 00:09:56,166
[protestor] We strongly condemn
this biological weapon,

154
00:09:56,266 --> 00:10:00,200
this circulation of killing
pandemic developed by our
government and America!

155
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:06,600
Just now, this group, which is
protesting against the lockdown
of the bridge, has started
their demonstration.

156
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:09,466
As you can see, tensions here
are running extremely high!

157
00:10:09,566 --> 00:10:11,000
Killing pandemic?

158
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:12,933
I guess they're talking
about Them.

159
00:10:13,033 --> 00:10:14,333
We don't know what kind
of group it is.

160
00:10:14,433 --> 00:10:17,033
According to the flyer
distributed by the group,

161
00:10:17,133 --> 00:10:22,933
the main focus of their protest
is to condemn those who allowed
this killing pandemic to spread.

162
00:10:23,033 --> 00:10:25,433
[reporter] It sounds like
they believe that the
biological weapon‐

163
00:10:25,533 --> 00:10:26,966
Are they serious?

164
00:10:27,066 --> 00:10:28,866
What? Biological weapon?!

165
00:10:28,966 --> 00:10:31,533
[Takashi] They know damn well no
kind of science can explain...

166
00:10:31,633 --> 00:10:33,933
why dead corpses walk
around eating people!

167
00:10:34,033 --> 00:10:37,400
You know this is just some
government propaganda.

168
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:38,366
Maybe the media‐

169
00:10:38,466 --> 00:10:39,600
[bang]

170
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:47,066
I didn't say you could shoot!

171
00:10:55,366 --> 00:10:58,033
Stop it!

172
00:10:58,133 --> 00:10:59,933
Stop shooting!

173
00:11:00,033 --> 00:11:01,200
She's still alive!

174
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:03,633
My girl is still alive!

175
00:11:03,733 --> 00:11:04,700
[lady] Pl..Please...

176
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:08,500
My baby... my baby...

177
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:12,333
[lady] Help her!

178
00:11:53,966 --> 00:11:56,366
[protestor]
See what they've done?!

179
00:11:56,466 --> 00:11:57,400
You see?!

180
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:00,866
They're killing off
citizens at random!

181
00:12:00,966 --> 00:12:04,533
Don't tolerate the tyranny
of the police!

182
00:12:06,566 --> 00:12:09,300
[protestor] If we allow them to
shoot one of us‐

183
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:12,533
Hey, shoot that guy. Just do it!

184
00:12:12,633 --> 00:12:13,766
[crowd] Don't tolerate it!

185
00:12:13,866 --> 00:12:15,633
Don't tolerate it!

186
00:12:15,733 --> 00:12:19,333
[crowd] Don't tolerate it!

187
00:12:19,433 --> 00:12:21,266
[captain] You must
leave immediately.
[protestor] Fuck off! What?

188
00:12:21,366 --> 00:12:23,966
I'm afraid it's too dangerous
for you to be here.

189
00:12:24,066 --> 00:12:25,266
Oh is it?!

190
00:12:25,366 --> 00:12:27,833
Any more dangerous than
the government?!

191
00:12:27,933 --> 00:12:29,233
Your conspiracies?!

192
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:31,300
I'll ask one more time.

193
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,833
You need to disband and go.

194
00:12:32,933 --> 00:12:34,366
Hell no!

195
00:12:34,466 --> 00:12:35,766
You go!

196
00:12:35,866 --> 00:12:38,400
[crowd]
Go home! Go home! Go home!

197
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:46,133
You don't seem to understand,
my friend. I've been given
strict orders to maintain
public safety...

198
00:12:46,233 --> 00:12:49,300
by any means necessary...

199
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:52,133
by whatever means I see fit...

200
00:12:53,833 --> 00:12:55,633
Huh?

201
00:12:56,866 --> 00:13:00,766
[screaming]

202
00:13:03,766 --> 00:13:06,366
Oh man. This is insane...

203
00:13:06,466 --> 00:13:08,466
Holy shit.

204
00:13:11,866 --> 00:13:13,600
We need to get the fuck
outta here.

205
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:19,000
No way, Takashi! We can't
leave now. They could attack
us in the dark.

206
00:13:33,533 --> 00:13:34,966
Sorry about that!

207
00:13:35,066 --> 00:13:38,333
Okay look lady, this is not
the time...

208
00:13:39,266 --> 00:13:40,633
Don't be like that.

209
00:13:40,733 --> 00:13:42,000
It's just a little kiss.

210
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:44,066
[Shizuka] See?
[Takashi] Hey!

211
00:13:47,066 --> 00:13:49,766
Kota, darling!

212
00:13:49,866 --> 00:13:51,633
Me? "Darling"?

213
00:13:51,733 --> 00:13:53,133
Me? Ooh!

214
00:13:53,233 --> 00:13:58,566
Good boy, good boy,
so you want a prize?

215
00:14:11,166 --> 00:14:12,600
We should keep it down!

216
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:14,600
Please go downstairs.

217
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:16,366
No! No way!

218
00:14:16,466 --> 00:14:19,533
I'm going to stay right here
just like this!

219
00:14:19,633 --> 00:14:24,100
Oh, I'm so tired, I might just
pass out...

220
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,333
Miss Shizuka?

221
00:14:29,866 --> 00:14:32,266
I'm so sleepy.

222
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,000
You know, you could help
me out here.

223
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:38,733
Uh, I like turtles.

224
00:14:40,933 --> 00:14:43,500
Okay, here we go. Hold on tight.

225
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,100
Hey wait!

226
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:48,966
You're touching my butt!

227
00:14:49,066 --> 00:14:51,533
You're naughty, Komuro.

228
00:14:51,633 --> 00:14:53,366
Such a bad boy!

229
00:14:53,466 --> 00:14:54,600
Naugthy...

230
00:14:56,966 --> 00:15:02,066
If this was any other time or
any other place, this would be
so fuckin' hot.

231
00:15:02,866 --> 00:15:05,733
Am I interrupting anything?

232
00:15:05,833 --> 00:15:07,900
[Takashi] No...

233
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,666
You're not
interrupting anything...

234
00:15:09,766 --> 00:15:13,500
[Rei] Hmm?
[Takashi] But if this
was another time...

235
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:18,000
[Rei] Hey, you look really
good in threes!

236
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:19,233
[Takashi] I'm what?

237
00:15:19,333 --> 00:15:22,400
All of a sudden there's
a bunch of you!

238
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:27,333
Oh come on, not you too?

239
00:15:27,433 --> 00:15:30,866
[Rei]
I guess I'm just exhausted.

240
00:15:30,966 --> 00:15:34,133
I can't believe it's
only been one day.

241
00:15:35,433 --> 00:15:39,166
I can't get a hold of
my mom or dad and...

242
00:15:39,266 --> 00:15:41,633
Hisashi is dead too.

243
00:15:41,733 --> 00:15:48,400
[sobbing]

244
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:58,100
[snoring]

245
00:16:13,466 --> 00:16:15,133
[Saeko] Komuro?

246
00:16:15,233 --> 00:16:17,800
Late‐night snack will
be ready soon.

247
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:19,366
[Saeko] And tomorrow's
lunch too.

248
00:16:19,466 --> 00:16:21,800
Man, I love girls' apartments.

249
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:23,633
Everything's so sta‐

250
00:16:29,966 --> 00:16:32,666
[Takashi] Stocked!
I‐I mean stocked!

251
00:16:32,766 --> 00:16:33,900
What's wrong?

252
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,633
Uh... W‐What? N‐Nothing!

253
00:16:36,733 --> 00:16:40,000
Oh, so you mean this old thing?

254
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:42,133
Yeah, terrible isn't it?

255
00:16:42,233 --> 00:16:46,033
[Saeko] I couldn't find a size
that fits me so until I finish
doing laundry I'm wearing this.

256
00:16:46,133 --> 00:16:47,700
But I guess it's a
little too revealing.

257
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:51,400
Oh, no, it's okay, I hadn't
noticed a titt‐ a thing!

258
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:54,666
We should be prepared.
They could come attit‐ attack.

259
00:16:54,766 --> 00:16:57,533
You and Hirano are watching out
for us and that's sweet.

260
00:16:57,633 --> 00:17:00,400
I want you to know how much
that means to me, Takashi.

261
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:04,466
[Saeko] I mean, I really
want you to know. Really.

262
00:17:05,866 --> 00:17:09,366
Hey Takashi! Come up here!

263
00:17:10,566 --> 00:17:11,533
[Rei] Come up here!

264
00:17:11,633 --> 00:17:14,066
[Saeko] You'd better pay
attention to her.

265
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:18,300
At times, a girl likes to,
well, pretend to be helpless.

266
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:21,066
[Takashi] Do you, Miss Busujima?

267
00:17:22,366 --> 00:17:25,366
[Saeko] I want to be called
"Saeko" by my friends.

268
00:17:26,566 --> 00:17:29,000
Sa..Sa...

269
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:31,300
You can call me that
after practicing.

270
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:35,000
[Rei] Come on! Get up here!

271
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:38,566
Takashi! Takashi!

272
00:17:53,033 --> 00:17:55,900
[Rei] He was always so
nice to me!

273
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,766
He paid attention to me.

274
00:17:57,866 --> 00:18:01,166
I mean, when we went to kareoke,
he really got into it.

275
00:18:01,266 --> 00:18:06,400
He didn't just sit there and
play Bubble Popper on his phone.

276
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:10,300
When I was lonely, he was always
there to listen to me.

277
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:13,266
[Rei] Even about me repeating
the same grade...

278
00:18:13,366 --> 00:18:16,600
All you ever do is get upset
about it, but...

279
00:18:16,933 --> 00:18:18,166
Yeah.

280
00:18:18,266 --> 00:18:20,933
Hey, are you listening?

281
00:18:21,033 --> 00:18:23,200
I'm just tired.

282
00:18:24,333 --> 00:18:26,533
[Takashi] I'm tired, that's all.

283
00:18:27,266 --> 00:18:29,133
What the hell is that?

284
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:32,100
See what I mean?
You're just boring.

285
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:35,666
Well yeah, I guess that's
probably why you dumped me.

286
00:18:35,766 --> 00:18:37,033
There are always two‐

287
00:18:37,133 --> 00:18:39,066
[Takashi] ...sides to
every story?

288
00:18:39,166 --> 00:18:40,900
Would've been nice if you
ever heard my side.

289
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,533
It would've been nice to hear
it. At least Hisashi talked
to me.

290
00:18:44,633 --> 00:18:45,866
Shut up!

291
00:18:45,966 --> 00:18:49,533
I swear to God, you bring up
Hisashi every chance you can!

292
00:18:49,633 --> 00:18:51,166
I'm not him!

293
00:18:51,266 --> 00:18:52,733
[Takashi] Besides...

294
00:18:52,833 --> 00:18:54,566
he's dead!

295
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:57,200
If anybody knows that, I do!

296
00:18:59,733 --> 00:19:02,233
Just face the facts will you?

297
00:19:02,333 --> 00:19:04,300
He's not coming back.

298
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:07,733
We're still alive, both of us.

299
00:19:07,833 --> 00:19:09,500
Want to stay that way?!

300
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,433
I do! So why don't you stop
bringing it‐

301
00:21:40,131 --> 00:21:42,231
[worker] A‐Are you serious?

302
00:21:42,331 --> 00:21:44,965
We'll take total responsibility.

303
00:21:45,065 --> 00:21:47,231
Just do it now!

304
00:21:49,365 --> 00:21:51,498
[worker] You've got to be
kidding me...

305
00:21:52,298 --> 00:21:55,265
[engine rev]

306
00:22:00,898 --> 00:22:03,198
Die, all of you!

307
00:22:06,065 --> 00:22:10,331
God damn it! I can't believe
they just abandoned all of
us here like that!

308
00:22:10,431 --> 00:22:13,265
Get back! It's coming this way!

309
00:22:16,665 --> 00:22:20,565
[officer] That's right,
we'll bring back the bulldozer
once you reach the middle of
the bridge.

310
00:22:20,665 --> 00:22:24,465
And we do have permission to
shoot whoever enters the area!

311
00:22:24,565 --> 00:22:26,831
Hang on, let me ask
the commander...

312
00:22:26,931 --> 00:22:28,431
[gunshot]

313
00:22:34,831 --> 00:22:36,765
[Takashi] Stop.

314
00:22:39,398 --> 00:22:42,231
If you keep this up, well...

315
00:22:43,031 --> 00:22:44,531
You know...

316
00:22:44,631 --> 00:22:46,098
[giggling]

317
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:48,265
[barking]

318
00:22:49,765 --> 00:22:52,631
Is that a dog barking?

319
00:22:52,731 --> 00:22:54,931
Even now, some things
never change.

320
00:22:55,031 --> 00:22:57,631
But it sounds close.

321
00:23:00,298 --> 00:23:02,398
Hira‐ What?

322
00:23:03,631 --> 00:23:05,665
Bad news, man.

323
00:23:07,031 --> 00:23:11,365
[barking]

324
00:23:15,965 --> 00:23:17,498
[Takashi] <i>They kept coming.</i>

325
00:23:17,598 --> 00:23:21,398
<i>It seemed like everywhere</i>
<i>we went, they followed.</i>

326
00:23:24,531 --> 00:23:28,698
<i>Their hunger, it never ended.</i>

327
00:23:29,265 --> 00:23:31,398
<i>They never ended.</i>
