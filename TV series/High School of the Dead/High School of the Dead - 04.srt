00:02:29,333 --> 00:02:31,166
[Saya] That's so stupid.

8
00:02:31,266 --> 00:02:32,633
[Takashi] What do you want?

9
00:02:32,733 --> 00:02:34,233
Every time you have to face
something you don't like,

10
00:02:34,333 --> 00:02:35,800
you come to this
stupid staircase.

11
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:37,166
It's like your own little
pity corner.

[Takashi] <i>That's right...</i>

<i>Everything was normal</i>

14

00:02:48,966 --> 00:02:50,566
<i>I'd rank fourth.</i>

Hey now, Mr. Tejima!

20
00:03:05,366 --> 00:03:07,233
[Hayashi] Excessive
violence is...

[Hisashi] Rei!

[Rei] Why?
Why is this happening?

29
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:56,433
[Takashi] There has to be
a reason.

30
00:03:56,533 --> 00:04:00,233
Maybe if we can figure out
what's causing it, we can
stop it.

31
00:04:00,333 --> 00:04:03,400
Or at least protect ourselves.

00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:20,100
<i>I wanted to believe that too.</i>

35
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,933
<i>But I already knew</i>
<i>intuitively...</i>

36
00:04:22,033 --> 00:04:26,566
<i>that the world that we'd</i>
<i>been familiar with was</i>
<i>already broken.</i>

37
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:29,533
<i>So, I...</i>

38
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,500
Gotcha!

39
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,566
Take this!

40
00:04:48,733 --> 00:04:49,966
[Takashi] <i>That's right...</i>

41
00:04:50,066 --> 00:04:51,700
<i>At that moment,</i>

42
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:55,866
<i>pretending that things</i>
<i>were normal sounded way</i>
<i>too dangerous.</i>

43
00:04:55,966 --> 00:04:57,533
<i>Everything was different.</i>

44
00:04:57,633 --> 00:05:01,466
<i>Walking down the school</i>
<i>hallway, weapons in</i>
<i>our hands...</i>

45
00:05:01,566 --> 00:05:04,666
<i>it wasn't just a school</i>
<i>hallway anymore.</i>

46
00:05:04,766 --> 00:05:07,200
<i>I used to think that high</i>
<i>school was Hell.</i>

47
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,333
<i>And now it was.</i>

48
00:05:18,966 --> 00:05:22,166
I wonder if anyone will come
to rescue us?

49
00:05:22,266 --> 00:05:24,266
They're not coming.

50
00:05:24,366 --> 00:05:25,066
Why not?

51
00:05:25,166 --> 00:05:26,900
How can you be so sure?

52
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,666
Just like the helicopters
we saw on the rooftop of
the school.

53
00:05:30,766 --> 00:05:33,366
[Takashi] They can't afford
to be rescuing us,

54
00:05:33,466 --> 00:05:35,733
and maybe they'll never be
able to.

55
00:05:35,833 --> 00:05:37,200
[Rei] Never?

56
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:40,600
Then what are we supposed to
do with no kind of help?!

57
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:43,000
We'll do whatever we can.

58
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:44,600
That's about it.

59
00:05:47,866 --> 00:05:49,833

The glass isn't half empty,
with you there is no glass.

61

You've been this way
since kindergarten.

62
00:05:54,733 --> 00:05:56,500
I only told you the truth!

63
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:59,800
[Rei] Yeah well you don't have
to be such a bummer about doing
it, you know!

64
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:03,333
[wheezing]

65
00:06:07,366 --> 00:06:08,366
Let's go.

66
00:06:08,466 --> 00:06:10,333
You're right...

67
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:23,000
But no matter where we go,
we're going to need a plan.

68
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:26,200
[Saeko] Teams! We need to
team up!

69
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,733
Let's go.

70
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,433
[Takashi] <i>Making moves then</i>

00:06:41,533 --> 00:06:43,966

[Shizuka] They're not

Do not go outside your vehicle,

We move any slower,
we'll be going in reverse.

At this rate, I'm not sure if
we can cross the bridge
before dawn.

[Shido] It's safe in here.

92
00:08:00,033 --> 00:08:02,066
It's okay.

93
00:08:02,166 --> 00:08:03,400
Mr. Shido...

94
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:06,766
You have nothing to worry
about, my darlings.

95
00:08:06,866 --> 00:08:10,733
There, there. It's all right.

96

[clapping]

97
00:08:14,933 --> 00:08:21,133
There, it's been decided. The
majority seems to have made
the choice quite clear, yes?

98
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,266
[Takashi] Rei!

99
00:08:30,733 --> 00:08:31,966
No way! Uh‐uh!

100
00:08:32,066 --> 00:08:34,566
I am not staying here with him!

101
00:08:35,866 --> 00:08:37,166
[Takashi] Wait!

102
00:08:37,266 --> 00:08:39,433
Get back on the bus.
I don't want you to leave!

103
00:08:39,533 --> 00:08:41,966
That's why I told you
you'd regret this!

104
00:08:42,066 --> 00:08:43,566
No! We'll both regret this!

Komuro, are you all right?

110
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:14,866
[Takashi] The police station!

111
00:09:14,966 --> 00:09:17,766
Meet at the east
police station.

112
00:09:17,866 --> 00:09:19,533
What time?

113
00:09:19,633 --> 00:09:21,433
[Takashi] 7 o'clock!

114
00:09:21,533 --> 00:09:25,233
If not today, then tomorrow
at the same time!

115
00:09:34,866 --> 00:10:56,833
[♪]

116
00:10:56,933 --> 00:10:58,133
[Rei] There's no one here.

117
00:10:58,233 --> 00:11:00,933
[Takashi] Did they get away
or did they die?

118
00:11:01,033 --> 00:11:03,833
[Rei] But if they die they'll
become Them.

119
00:11:05,606 --> 00:11:08,615
[Takashi] Maybe they went to
find others, the ones that
are still alive.

120
00:11:15,848 --> 00:11:18,115
Takashi, look at that!

121
00:11:21,115 --> 00:11:23,948
No license, no helmet,
stolen bike.

122
00:11:24,048 --> 00:11:26,082
I'm just asking to be
arrested, aren't I?

123
00:11:26,182 --> 00:11:28,548
Oh what? After fighting that
many of Them,

124
00:11:28,648 --> 00:11:30,982
don't tell me you're still
afraid of the police?

125
00:11:31,082 --> 00:11:33,148
You've got a point!

126
00:11:42,248 --> 00:11:44,548
[Takashi] You've got to be
kidding me...

127
00:11:45,582 --> 00:11:46,948
Rei!

128
00:11:47,048 --> 00:11:50,315
Wait, there's leaking gas
from that car. Don't do it.

129
00:11:50,415 --> 00:11:53,515
[Rei] There could be something
in there that we could use.

130
00:11:54,515 --> 00:11:55,748
What's wrong with you?

131
00:11:55,848 --> 00:11:58,148
This is Armageddon! Man up!

132
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:15,615
[Rei] Do you know how to use it?

133
00:12:15,715 --> 00:12:19,148
[Takashi] I've watched enough
TV. How hard could it be?

134
00:12:19,248 --> 00:12:23,582
And what do they say? Don't aim
it unless you plan to shoot.

135
00:12:31,815 --> 00:12:33,048
[Rei] What's the matter?

136
00:12:33,148 --> 00:12:35,782
It's just a lot heavier than
I thought it'd be.

137
00:12:35,882 --> 00:12:39,515
[Rei] Of course it is;
it's the real thing.

138
00:12:45,915 --> 00:12:48,515
[Takashi] It can only shoot
five times?

139
00:12:48,615 --> 00:12:51,482
[Rei] Takashi, here.

140
00:12:55,815 --> 00:13:00,748
The grip on the other gun was
broken, but I think that the
bullets are still good.

141
00:13:00,848 --> 00:13:03,182
They're bloody but
still usable.

142
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:05,548
[Takashi] Heh, I'm impressed.

143
00:13:05,648 --> 00:13:09,315
My dad collects guns so I've
been around them my whole life.

144
00:13:09,415 --> 00:13:14,382
Besides do you think I'd freak
out over a little blood now?

145
00:13:23,615 --> 00:13:25,048
Should we get rid of these?

146
00:13:25,148 --> 00:13:27,182
No, let's keep them until we can
get some target practice.

147
00:13:27,282 --> 00:13:32,215
Good point and don't you feel
better now with something that
has a little more oomph?

148
00:13:52,848 --> 00:13:54,282
[Rei] I wonder if they
still got gas?

149
00:13:54,382 --> 00:13:56,415
[Takashi] They say any
gas station...

150
00:13:56,515 --> 00:13:59,648
has a tank thats big enough to
hold enough gasoline to fill up
a thousand cars,

151
00:13:59,748 --> 00:14:01,615
so they should have some.

152
00:14:06,882 --> 00:14:08,282
What's the matter?

153
00:14:08,382 --> 00:14:10,548
[Takashi] This gas station
is self‐service.

154
00:14:10,648 --> 00:14:13,782
We can't get gas unless we
put money or a card in there.

155
00:14:13,882 --> 00:14:15,715
[Rei] Then, put it in there!

156
00:14:15,815 --> 00:14:21,048
With the money I have, the only
thing we're gonna get out of
this pump is fumes.

157
00:14:21,148 --> 00:14:22,915
You're the worst...

158
00:14:23,015 --> 00:14:24,282
I'm sorry, okay?!

159
00:14:24,382 --> 00:14:28,648
I guess Hisashi would have
the cash!

160
00:14:28,748 --> 00:14:29,915
Where did that come from?!

161
00:14:30,015 --> 00:14:32,182
When did I ever compare you
to Hisashi?

162
00:14:32,282 --> 00:14:34,282
You said I'm the worst,
didn't you?!

163
00:14:34,382 --> 00:14:36,782
That means someone is the
best, right?

164
00:14:36,882 --> 00:14:39,482
You must have meant Hisashi!

165
00:14:40,315 --> 00:14:43,415
I didn't then, but I do now.

166
00:14:46,548 --> 00:14:48,048
What do you want?

167
00:14:48,148 --> 00:14:51,182
Money! I need to borrow some!

168
00:14:51,282 --> 00:14:55,348
I kinda... I kinda left my
wallet in the bag.

169
00:14:56,482 --> 00:14:57,915
[Takashi] Aw Jesus.

170
00:14:58,015 --> 00:15:00,615
And you're riding my ass?

171
00:15:01,748 --> 00:15:02,715
Just wait here.

172
00:15:02,815 --> 00:15:05,348
Scream if something happens.

173
00:15:16,915 --> 00:15:19,615
[♪]

174
00:15:19,715 --> 00:15:22,382
Hello? Is there anybody here?

175
00:15:33,215 --> 00:15:35,282
[Takashi] Nah, not working.

176
00:15:35,382 --> 00:15:39,382
Oh well, I've always wanted
to do this anyway.

177
00:15:44,748 --> 00:15:46,215
[crash]

178
00:15:46,315 --> 00:15:47,215
What is he...?

179
00:15:47,315 --> 00:15:48,882
[crash]

[jingle]

181
00:15:51,582 --> 00:15:54,248
He's having a field day, huh?

182
00:16:01,282 --> 00:16:05,748
Come on Rei, stop giving the guy
such a hard time.

183
00:16:05,848 --> 00:16:13,515

Oh no!

186
00:16:17,982 --> 00:16:19,882
Hey, quit squirmin'!

187
00:16:21,915 --> 00:16:24,215
Rei, what's wrong?

188
00:16:27,948 --> 00:16:31,382
[laughing]

189
00:16:31,482 --> 00:16:35,448
Hey, you've got a fuckin'
hot piece of ass here,
you know that?

190
00:16:35,548 --> 00:16:36,715
You let her go!

191
00:16:36,815 --> 00:16:39,782
Ha ha! Why would I do that?

192
00:16:39,882 --> 00:16:43,648
You think I'd go for one of
those stanky‐ass zombie bitches?

193
00:16:43,748 --> 00:16:46,182
[ruffian]
Think again motherfucker!

194
00:16:49,115 --> 00:16:51,915
Jesus man, are you crazy?
That it?

195
00:16:52,015 --> 00:16:53,648
[ruffian] Crazy?

196
00:16:53,748 --> 00:16:55,315
Hell yeah, I am!

197
00:16:55,415 --> 00:16:59,315
My family became Them right
in front of my own eyes!

198
00:16:59,415 --> 00:17:00,615
I had to...

199
00:17:00,715 --> 00:17:03,082
I had to smash everyone's head!

200
00:17:03,182 --> 00:17:05,382
My father! My mother!

201
00:17:05,482 --> 00:17:06,882
My grandma and brother!

202
00:17:06,982 --> 00:17:08,848
Even my little sister too!

203
00:17:08,948 --> 00:17:15,148
How can I be normal? You think I
wouldn't be fucked up
after that?!

204
00:17:17,448 --> 00:17:18,982
Takashi!

205
00:17:22,782 --> 00:17:24,982
Rei!

206
00:17:25,082 --> 00:17:27,515
I sure like the way you scream.

207
00:17:27,615 --> 00:17:32,082
[ruffian] And the way you feel.
Quite a handful there.

208
00:17:34,348 --> 00:17:36,448
You're fuckin' her, aren't ya?

209
00:17:36,548 --> 00:17:41,848
I bet you stickin' it to this
hot little bitch day and night.

210
00:17:41,948 --> 00:17:43,115
Wait a minute...

211
00:17:43,215 --> 00:17:45,615
Holy shit! You haven't!

212
00:17:45,715 --> 00:17:50,648
[ruffian] You haven't got
on this yet! What a fuckin'
pussy, man!

213
00:17:50,748 --> 00:17:53,215
Takashi!

214
00:17:53,315 --> 00:17:55,115
[ruffian] Hey, drop the bat.

215
00:17:55,215 --> 00:17:57,482
If you don't, I'll kill
this slut.

216
00:17:57,582 --> 00:18:01,282
And the bike, gimmie your
fuckin' bike, man!

217
00:18:01,915 --> 00:18:03,082
There's no gas in it.

218
00:18:03,182 --> 00:18:04,748
[ruffian] I heard you in
the store!

219
00:18:04,848 --> 00:18:10,182
Put the cash you got in the slot
and pump the motherfuckin' gas!

220
00:18:13,315 --> 00:18:15,048

[automated voice] Please touch
the antistatic sheet before you
start pumping the gas.

223
00:18:37,082 --> 00:18:40,015
[Takashi] Hey, will you let
us go now?

224
00:18:41,482 --> 00:18:44,482
You can have the bike. We need
to see if our families are
all right.

225
00:18:44,582 --> 00:18:48,482
[ruffian] Shut the fuck up!
I don't give a shit about
your parents!

226
00:18:48,582 --> 00:18:53,315
They're gonna end up just like
my family did ya fuckin' retard.

227
00:18:53,948 --> 00:18:55,482
[Takashi] It's done.

228
00:18:57,115 --> 00:19:00,182
Away from the bike and
start walkin'!

229
00:19:06,982 --> 00:19:08,015
[Takashi] Come on man‐

230
00:19:08,115 --> 00:19:10,415
Don't take one more
fuckin' step!

231
00:19:18,015 --> 00:19:19,282
Dude, I'm begging‐

232
00:19:19,382 --> 00:19:23,282
Shut up or I'll fuckin'
kill you, motherfucker!

233
00:19:34,115 --> 00:19:35,882
[Takashi] I've never shot
a gun before,

234
00:19:35,982 --> 00:19:38,082
but somehow I don't think
I'd miss at this range.

235
00:19:38,182 --> 00:19:42,915
The gas... the gasoline'd blow
us all up.

236
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:45,982
It's better than someone
stealing my girl.

Bleeding, I'm bleeding!

00:20:07,982 --> 00:20:10,548
Be glad I don't shoot you!

241
00:20:10,648 --> 00:20:11,782
You asshole!

242
00:20:11,882 --> 00:20:14,282
[Takashi] Stop it, Rei.

243
00:20:14,382 --> 00:20:15,548
[Rei] But he...

244
00:20:15,648 --> 00:20:18,915
We don't have time to be
screwing around with this guy.

245
00:20:19,015 --> 00:20:22,148
Besides, company's coming.

You can't leave me here!

No!

Takashi?

00:22:44,882 --> 00:22:46,815
Why are you so quiet?

257
00:22:46,915 --> 00:22:51,748
I was just thinking, stuff like
that is gonna happen over and
over again from now on.

258
00:22:51,848 --> 00:22:53,815
You think so?

I mean, I guess so.

Don't worry about it.
