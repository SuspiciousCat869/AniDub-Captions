Bad news, man.

It's worse.
It's getting much worse.

00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:20,566
Damn it...

17
00:03:20,666 --> 00:03:22,500
That's it. I can't stand it.

18
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:23,400
Komuro!

19
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:24,766
Yeah, what?

20
00:03:24,866 --> 00:03:26,166
You shoot them, but then what?

21
00:03:26,266 --> 00:03:27,700
Isn't it obvious?

22
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:28,833
I'll shoot them and protect‐

23
00:03:28,933 --> 00:03:30,466
What happen? Did you forget?

24
00:03:30,566 --> 00:03:34,000
They react to every little
sound, Komuro.

25
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:35,600
[Saeko] And...

26
00:03:39,133 --> 00:03:40,633
And as for the living...

27
00:03:42,366 --> 00:03:45,633
They just swarm around like
bugs, looking for the light.

28
00:03:45,733 --> 00:03:47,133
And for us.

29
00:03:47,233 --> 00:03:49,133
[Saeko] We need to stay
in the dark.

30
00:03:49,233 --> 00:03:52,266
We're not capable of saving all
the live ones out there.

31
00:03:52,366 --> 00:03:55,800
Here.
Take a good look out there.

32
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:57,600
And you'd better get used to it.

33
00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:01,566
I'm afraid just being manly
is no longer good enough
to survive anymore.

34
00:04:06,833 --> 00:04:11,133
I thought that out of any of
us, you'd look at things a
little differently.

35
00:04:13,566 --> 00:04:16,200
Don't misunderstand me.
I'm not being cruel.

36
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:20,000
I'm sorry Komuro, but this is
just the way things are now.

37
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:22,066
I'm not saying that
I like it.

38
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:31,700
Try to keep it down when you
check out there, will ya?

Daddy, where's Mommy?

41
00:04:59,733 --> 00:05:01,633
We'll meet up with Mommy later.

42
00:05:01,733 --> 00:05:03,400
Come on, this way.

43
00:05:06,733 --> 00:05:08,000
[father] Please let us in!

44
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:10,700
I've got a child and we have no
way to evacuate!

45
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,400
Please, let us in!

46
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:19,266
Let us in! We need help!

47
00:05:19,366 --> 00:05:22,333
[resident] Get away from the
door! Go somewhere else!

48
00:05:22,433 --> 00:05:24,133
Please, I don't care about me,

49
00:05:24,233 --> 00:05:26,533
but my little girl! Let her in!

50
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:38,433
Daddy?

51
00:05:38,533 --> 00:05:39,733
Open the door!

52
00:05:39,833 --> 00:05:42,400
[father] If you don't, I swear
to God I'll break it down!

53
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:44,033
Daddy!

54
00:05:44,133 --> 00:05:45,533
God damnit, do it!

00:05:45,633 --> 00:05:48,933

I'm going to open it right now.

00:06:30,133 --> 00:06:32,633
I'm so sorry.

00:06:32,733 --> 00:06:34,400
Please forgive me...

Daddy?

65
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:54,600
Daddy's okay. I'm all right.

66
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,900
[father] Go and hide,

67
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,966
so no one can find you.

68
00:07:02,066 --> 00:07:03,566
Go and...

69
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:06,633
hide somewhere...

70
00:07:23,133 --> 00:07:24,466

No!

73
00:07:31,966 --> 00:07:33,400
No!

74
00:07:35,266 --> 00:07:38,033
I want to be with you, Daddy.

75
00:07:38,133 --> 00:07:40,966
I want to be with you forever!

That's what you ugly dead beats
get for trying to go after a
little girl like that.

79
00:08:18,733 --> 00:08:22,133
You want something to eat?
How about you munch on some
of these?

80
00:08:22,233 --> 00:08:23,566
[Kota] Ready, aim...

81

[Kota] What?

89
00:08:49,033 --> 00:08:50,900
I thought you said you
weren't going to shoot?

90
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,433
That you didn't want
to make noise?

91
00:08:52,533 --> 00:08:54,133
So we wouldn't attract
any attention.

92
00:08:54,233 --> 00:08:56,866
But it's a little girl
we're talking about!

93
00:08:56,966 --> 00:08:57,966
You go get her!

94
00:08:58,066 --> 00:08:59,600
And I'll cover you
from up here!

95
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:06,000
[Takashi] Be right back.
[Rei] Takashi...

96
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:07,733
There's a little girl who
needs us now.

97
00:09:07,833 --> 00:09:09,766
Bu‐ Then I'm coming with
you to help.

98
00:09:09,866 --> 00:09:12,466
[Takashi] No, stay in the foyer
and be on the lookout.

99
00:09:12,566 --> 00:09:14,700
I'll go there on the bike.
I'll be fine.

100
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:15,900
[Rei] By bike? But you...

101
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,333
[Saeko] Let him go.

102
00:09:19,033 --> 00:09:21,900
It's a man's decision after all.

103
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,033
I'll be back as soon as I can.

104
00:09:26,133 --> 00:09:27,466
Wish me luck.

105
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:31,200
You go knock 'em dead, cowboy.

106
00:09:35,366 --> 00:09:37,966
Don't worry about this place
or the girls.

107
00:09:38,066 --> 00:09:39,733
I'll hold down the fort.

108
00:09:41,133 --> 00:09:42,466
[Rei] Takashi...

109
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,066
Take this at least.

110
00:09:54,033 --> 00:09:55,866
[Saeko] Don't count on the
gun too much.

111
00:09:55,966 --> 00:09:58,266
If you shoot,
they'll swarm around you.

112
00:09:58,366 --> 00:10:00,933
[Takashi] Either way,
the bike will make noise.

113
00:10:01,033 --> 00:10:02,700
[Saeko] But on the bike,
you'll be moving.

114
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:06,266
Fire a shot, it'll be like
ringing the dinner bell.

115
00:10:10,933 --> 00:10:12,433
You ready?

116

[engine starting]

117
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:01,066
[Saya] What the hell?
What's with all the racket?

118
00:11:01,733 --> 00:11:03,900
Something good happened.

119
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,333
Like what?

120
00:11:05,433 --> 00:11:07,766
I realized that we're still
human beings after all!

121
00:11:07,866 --> 00:11:09,366
[Saya] Shut up.

122
00:11:18,866 --> 00:11:20,533
[Kota] Reload!

123
00:11:25,866 --> 00:11:27,533
[Takashi] That must be it!

124
00:11:44,833 --> 00:11:47,066
Nothing ever goes as
planned does it?

125
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:50,200
[barking]

126
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Nice shot, man!

127
00:12:03,066 --> 00:12:04,400
Of course!

128
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,433
Go away! Go away!

129
00:12:07,533 --> 00:12:09,400
Mommy! Daddy!

130
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:12,500
I just want to go home!
Please come get me!

131
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,633
Mommy! Daddy!

132
00:12:15,766 --> 00:12:18,000
No!

133
00:12:25,133 --> 00:12:27,066
Don't worry about a thing, kid.

134
00:12:27,166 --> 00:12:29,200
You're gonna be just fine!

135
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:37,966
[Saya] Miss Shizuka!

136
00:12:38,066 --> 00:12:40,566
Come on, wake up! Miss Shizuka!

137
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:44,433
Huh?

138
00:12:45,966 --> 00:12:48,300
Time for breakfast already?

139
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,200
Snap out of it!

140
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,200
[Shizuka] Stop it...

141
00:12:58,733 --> 00:13:00,733
Just back the fuck off!

142
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,100
There's one behind you!

143
00:13:15,433 --> 00:13:18,333
Thanks a lot kid,
you just saved my ass.

144
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:22,366
[Saya] Hirano!

145
00:13:22,466 --> 00:13:23,600
Takagi?

146
00:13:30,633 --> 00:13:32,066
Miss Shizuka!

147
00:13:32,166 --> 00:13:33,400
[Shizuka] Hi!

148
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:35,233
I'm getting ready to get
out of here.

149
00:13:35,333 --> 00:13:38,100
There's no way we can stay here
after all this God damn noise.

150
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:40,466
I want you to pack up and
be ready to go!

151
00:13:40,566 --> 00:13:41,566
[Saya] Got it?

152
00:13:41,666 --> 00:13:43,000
O‐Okay!

153
00:13:48,133 --> 00:13:50,000
[Saya] Miyamoto...

154
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:53,733
let Miss Busujima handle it
and give me a hand.

155
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:58,000
And how about you take a look
in that backpack and find some
clothes to put on?

156
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:00,200
Oh! No wonder I was
feeling cold!

157
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:02,333
Saeko, we need to get
the car ready.

158
00:14:02,433 --> 00:14:04,500
And now's our chance to get it.

159
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:07,433
While the zombie contingent is
out there after Komuro.

160
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:12,800
[Saya] What are we going
to do about that?

161
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:15,733
At that rate, he won't be able
to come back even with the bike.

162
00:14:15,833 --> 00:14:16,900
If so...

163
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,400
we have no choice but
to go get him.

164
00:14:25,766 --> 00:14:28,533
Do you... do you guys think
that's a bad idea?

165
00:14:28,633 --> 00:14:31,200
I mean I've got the car
keys and everything.

166
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:33,100
No, sounds like a plan.

167
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:37,400
She's right. Hell of a plan.
Let's do it!

168
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:40,800
We rescue Komuro, and then
haul ass to the other side
of the river.

169
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:42,533
Come on, get ready!

170
00:14:46,133 --> 00:14:47,733
[Arisu] Hey mister...

171
00:14:53,933 --> 00:14:57,300
That man... That's my daddy.

172
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:06,566
What are you...?

173
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:23,033
He died trying to protect you.

174
00:15:23,133 --> 00:15:25,033
Your father was a brave man.

175
00:15:40,033 --> 00:15:41,466
Daddy...

176
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:44,566
Daddy...

177
00:15:44,666 --> 00:15:57,133
[sobbing]

178
00:15:57,900 --> 00:15:59,666
We've got tons of stuff.

179
00:15:59,766 --> 00:16:02,133
[Shizuka] I wonder if we can get
it'll all fit?

180
00:16:02,233 --> 00:16:05,366
[Rei] What if they attack us
while we're loading?

181
00:16:05,466 --> 00:16:09,333
We've just got to do it
really quietly, like the
bandits online.

182
00:16:09,433 --> 00:16:11,333
[Saeko] Let's do it
that way then.

183
00:16:20,866 --> 00:16:22,633
Huh? What is this?

184
00:16:22,733 --> 00:16:24,266
The steering wheel is...

185
00:16:24,366 --> 00:16:26,300
it's on the wrong side!

186
00:16:30,533 --> 00:16:33,000
Listen sweetie, you need to try
to be quiet.

187
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:35,700
The noise will only bring
more of them.

188
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:38,333
Can't we get away from them?

189
00:16:38,433 --> 00:16:40,233
[Takashi]
We're going to try, hunny.

190
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:44,300
But can't we just go above
all of them?

191
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:47,200
Ah, wouldn't I love to
be above it all?

192
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,100
[Kota] We load our stuff,

193
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:53,766
rescue Komuro and the girl,
then get out of here.

194
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:55,600
I don't know...

195
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:58,466
They're too many of them
even for a Hum‐Vee.

196
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,266
Wish we had a tank or something.

197
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:12,233
[Kota] Maybe if Komuro could
get a little closer to us.

198
00:17:12,333 --> 00:17:14,000
But how?

199
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:17,566
Very nice!

200
00:17:22,433 --> 00:17:25,300
[Kota] Man, that's some balls!

201
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:38,100
We're gonna make i‐ ah!

202
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,400
Stop it. Stop it!

203
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:41,300
Get down! Stop!

204
00:17:44,566 --> 00:17:45,633
[Takashi] Thanks.

205
00:17:45,733 --> 00:17:46,700
Aren't you scared?

206
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,666
[Arisu] I am. How about you?

207
00:17:48,766 --> 00:17:50,633
No way...

208
00:17:50,733 --> 00:17:52,233
I mean, a little.

209
00:17:53,033 --> 00:17:54,400
Where's Hirano?

210
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,400
What? I think he's
still upstairs.

211
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:59,333
Jeez, I don't know if he's
sharp or slow.

212
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:02,433
Huh?

213
00:18:06,266 --> 00:18:08,700
[Kota] What? What's the matter?

214
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:11,033
[Saya] Oh wow.
You look so sexy.

215
00:18:11,133 --> 00:18:12,866
[Kota] Oh you really think‐
wait a minute.

216
00:18:12,966 --> 00:18:14,333
[Saya] Get in the car!

217
00:18:16,366 --> 00:18:19,533
[Takashi] Uh, wait, what did you
just say?

218
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,033
[Arisu] I've gotta pee.

219
00:18:22,133 --> 00:18:24,933
[Takashi] Oh no.
Can't you hold it?

220
00:18:25,033 --> 00:18:26,733
[Arisu] Umm, no.

221
00:18:26,833 --> 00:18:29,266
[Takashi] How about you just
think of something else?

222
00:18:29,366 --> 00:18:32,600
Think about playing or what's
your favorite TV show?

223
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:34,966
[Takashi] What about‐
[Arisu] No! I can't!

224
00:18:35,066 --> 00:18:37,400
I‐I can't hold it any more!

225
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:40,966
[Takashi] Okay then. Just, go
ahead and pee right there.

226
00:18:41,066 --> 00:18:42,233
[Arisu] Are you sure?

227
00:18:42,333 --> 00:18:44,100
[Takashi] Yeah, I'm sure.

228
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:05,400
<i>Oh shit!</i>

229
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:09,333
<i>I don't know if we're going to</i>
<i>make it...</i>

230
00:19:09,433 --> 00:19:11,166
[engine]

231
00:19:15,666 --> 00:19:17,000
[bark]

232
00:19:44,378 --> 00:19:45,625
Whoa, there's so many!

233
00:19:45,725 --> 00:19:48,959
It doesn't matter!
We can't just turn back now.

234
00:19:49,059 --> 00:19:50,759
Run 'em down!

235
00:19:54,459 --> 00:19:57,525
[screech]

236
00:19:59,925 --> 00:20:01,925
[Takashi] Hang on just
a little bit longer.

237
00:20:07,459 --> 00:20:09,225
Takashi, hurry up!

238
00:20:09,325 --> 00:20:11,459
Easier said than done!

239
00:20:12,459 --> 00:20:14,159
Hirano, buy us some time!

240
00:20:14,259 --> 00:20:15,625
Jawohl!

241
00:20:26,292 --> 00:20:27,659
Gotcha!

242
00:20:44,025 --> 00:20:45,025
Komuro!

243
00:20:45,125 --> 00:20:48,125
[Rei] Takashi!
[Saya] Come on, let's go!

244
00:20:48,225 --> 00:20:50,625
Are they friends of yours?

245
00:20:50,725 --> 00:20:54,059
Yeah. Really good friends.

246
00:20:56,692 --> 00:20:59,259
This is the last ride to get to
the other side of the river.

247
00:20:59,359 --> 00:21:01,425
Are you going to get in?

248
00:21:01,525 --> 00:21:02,925
Course I am!

249
00:22:42,692 --> 00:22:44,692
Nice to meet ya!
I'm Kota!

250
00:22:44,792 --> 00:22:45,825
Hit it!

251
00:22:45,925 --> 00:22:47,059
Okay!

252
00:22:55,059 --> 00:22:56,059
I'm sorry.

253
00:23:11,225 --> 00:23:12,692
[Takashi] <i>Somehow,</i>

254
00:23:12,792 --> 00:23:15,525
<i>we managed to get out of there.</i>

255
00:23:15,625 --> 00:23:18,925
<i>But that only meant we survived</i>
<i>another day.</i>

256
00:23:21,625 --> 00:23:25,659
<i>Now... Now we had to find a way</i>
<i>to cross the river,</i>

257
00:23:25,759 --> 00:23:28,192
<i>and find our family.</i>
