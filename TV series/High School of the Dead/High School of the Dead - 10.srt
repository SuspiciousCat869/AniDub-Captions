1
00:00:03,433 --> 00:00:06,166
T‐Takashi...

2
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:08,300
Rei...

3
00:00:10,266 --> 00:00:12,166
Ready or not, here I come!

4
00:00:12,266 --> 00:00:14,366
Don't let her escape, Komuro.

5
00:00:14,466 --> 00:00:15,633
Uh, okay.

6
00:00:15,733 --> 00:00:17,266
It's gonna hurt!

7
00:00:17,366 --> 00:00:18,666
A little.

8
00:00:20,533 --> 00:00:23,133
[Rei] No!

9
00:00:23,233 --> 00:00:25,466
[Shizuka]
It's for your own good.

10
00:00:27,566 --> 00:00:31,700
[Takashi] <i>One day had passed</i>
<i>since Saeko and I made it to</i>
<i>Takagi's house.</i>

11
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:35,333
<i>And I have to say, that this</i>
<i>was the first "ordinary time"</i>
<i>I've had...</i>

12
00:00:35,433 --> 00:00:38,900
<i>since this whole awful</i>
<i>ordeal began.</i>

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,733
<i>And it was kind of hot!</i>

14
00:02:19,566 --> 00:02:20,633
[Shizuka] Did it burn?

15
00:02:20,733 --> 00:02:22,466
That was my special formula!

16
00:02:22,566 --> 00:02:23,833
You traitor!

17
00:02:23,933 --> 00:02:25,200
[Takashi] Wh‐Why?

18
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:27,333
I only held you down while
she rubbed your back.

19
00:02:27,433 --> 00:02:29,566
[Rei] That's not what I meant!

20
00:02:29,666 --> 00:02:31,766
Then, what was it?

21
00:02:31,866 --> 00:02:32,766
[Rei] Can't you guess?

22
00:02:32,866 --> 00:02:34,533
Guess? Guess what?

23
00:02:34,633 --> 00:02:36,000
Guess not.

24
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:38,333
All I need is just a little bit
of medicine on me.

25
00:02:38,433 --> 00:02:41,500
You don't need to call in the
school nurse.

26
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,766
Huh?

27
00:02:42,866 --> 00:02:44,366
Get out of here.

28
00:02:44,466 --> 00:02:46,666
[Takashi]
What is it all of a sudden?

29
00:02:46,766 --> 00:02:51,700
[Rei] My boobs are killing me
because you used them to
balance an AK‐47!

30
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,300
Now get out!

31
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:00,633
Whatever, she loved it.

32
00:03:00,733 --> 00:03:02,533
[thud]

33
00:03:02,633 --> 00:03:07,133
[man] You idiot,
you're walking too fast!

34
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,066
Let me help you.

35
00:03:10,166 --> 00:03:12,000
No kid, it's all right.

36
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:14,100
[idiot] You just leave this
for the big boys.

37
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,900
The "big boys"?

38
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,200
[man] Just go relax, pretty boy.

39
00:03:18,833 --> 00:03:20,933
What's their problem?

40
00:03:21,033 --> 00:03:23,600
[Saeko]
Don't worry about it too much.

41
00:03:29,233 --> 00:03:31,000
What's the matter?

42
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:32,766
[Takashi] Oh, it's just...

43
00:03:32,866 --> 00:03:35,100
It looks good on you.

44
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:38,533
Really good. Really good.

45
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,933
I mean...
I didn't mean it in a weird way!

46
00:03:46,033 --> 00:03:49,933
It's cool, I got it!
I didn't take it that way.

47
00:03:50,033 --> 00:03:52,700
[Takashi] Whew.

48
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:55,000
[laughing]

49
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:57,300
Hey, what is it?

50
00:03:58,466 --> 00:04:01,466
Why are you laughing?
Did something happen?

51
00:04:01,566 --> 00:04:04,733
Uh, we were just saying that
we're so glad that you're okay.

52
00:04:04,833 --> 00:04:08,366
Yeah, I'm more than okay!

53
00:04:14,833 --> 00:04:17,866
Looks like we all are now.

54
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:20,600
[Saya] Fine!
You're always right! Always!

55
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,400
Or were...

56
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,366
[Takashi]
What's the matter with you?

57
00:04:28,066 --> 00:04:29,700
You don't have to ask
like such a prick.

58
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:32,433
[Takashi] I'm sorry.
What's the matter with you?

59
00:04:32,533 --> 00:04:36,333
Maybe prick was the wrong word.
I shoulda said asshole!

60
00:04:37,766 --> 00:04:39,100
I don't want to talk about it.

61
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:42,466
Just drop it. Leave me alone.

62
00:04:43,066 --> 00:04:44,266
Hey, Taka‐

63
00:04:44,366 --> 00:04:46,733
[Saya] I said I don't
want to talk about it!

64
00:04:46,833 --> 00:04:49,433
[Takashi] What is the matter?

65
00:04:49,533 --> 00:04:52,500
[Yuriko] Sorry to draw you into
our little discussion.

66
00:04:56,133 --> 00:04:58,633
No, it's okay.

67
00:04:58,733 --> 00:05:00,300
I guess you're used to it.

68
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,666
You've known each other
since kindergarten.

69
00:05:03,766 --> 00:05:06,366
Yeah, some things never change.

70
00:05:06,466 --> 00:05:09,100
Your house is really beautiful,
by the way.

71
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,500
[Takashi]
I'd always heard about it,

72
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:14,233
but I'd never thought I'd ever
see inside of it.

73
00:05:14,333 --> 00:05:18,000
[Yuriko] Come to think of it,
you've never been to my
house before, have you?

74
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:19,633
[Takashi] No, never.

75
00:05:19,733 --> 00:05:22,200
[Yuriko] You weren't afraid
of coming here, were you?

76
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:25,033
[Takashi]
A little intimidated, yeah...

77
00:05:25,133 --> 00:05:27,000
I'm sorry.

78
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:29,400
You're honest. I like that.

79
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:33,033
[Takashi] But I heard that you
don't stay here long.

80
00:05:33,133 --> 00:05:34,933
[Yuriko] No.

81
00:05:35,033 --> 00:05:37,733
[Kota] This is the
carrier spring ejector.

82
00:05:40,333 --> 00:05:44,333
[Saya]
You look like you're having fun.

83
00:05:44,433 --> 00:05:47,800
Just wanna let you know you
should enjoy it while you can.

84
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:50,133
None of us are going to
be here forever.

85
00:05:50,233 --> 00:05:51,966
[Kota] Why not, Takagi?

86
00:05:52,066 --> 00:05:54,033
This house is almost
like a fortress.

87
00:05:54,133 --> 00:05:59,066
Haven't you thought about
how hard it is to secure things
like electricity and water?

88
00:05:59,166 --> 00:06:01,133
Things have changed lately,
you know.

89
00:06:01,233 --> 00:06:04,100
[Kota] Oh, um, well...

90
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:07,366
Even under normal circumstances,
which we're not,

91
00:06:07,466 --> 00:06:09,566
we'd have to
find basic necessities.

92
00:06:09,666 --> 00:06:12,500
[Saya] You think we could
all just build a water
treatment plant?

93
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:17,000
Or a power station? Maybe the
zombies would help us do it.

94
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:19,166
[Yuriko] When the dead
started attacking people,

95
00:06:19,266 --> 00:06:24,833
the commander sent the
Self Defense Forces to the power
plants at his own discretion.

96
00:06:24,933 --> 00:06:29,600
He's not the kind of man to sit
around and wait on the prime
minister's incompetency.

97
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:32,733
If that's the case,
maybe they'll keep things
working a little longer...

98
00:06:32,833 --> 00:06:35,966
[Yuriko] So optimistic.
How much longer do you think

99
00:06:36,066 --> 00:06:38,866
those maintainance workers
will stay there?

100
00:06:38,966 --> 00:06:41,266
They have families too,
don't they?

101
00:06:41,366 --> 00:06:44,400
And their family members aren't
at the power plants.

102
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:47,533
[Takashi] So, you plan on
taking the buses and...

103
00:06:47,633 --> 00:06:50,566
Correct, but only the ones
we're responsible for.

104
00:06:50,666 --> 00:06:55,733
Or rather, we'll only be taking
the ones that can survive
outside of this place.

105
00:06:55,833 --> 00:06:57,400
It's Darwinian, I know.

106
00:06:59,733 --> 00:07:01,766
[Maddo] Hey, hey...

107
00:07:01,866 --> 00:07:04,266
Hold on, that's a real gun,
isn't it?

108
00:07:04,366 --> 00:07:06,866
A kid like you shouldn't
be playing with it.

109
00:07:06,966 --> 00:07:08,266
[Kota] Sorry, sir.

110
00:07:08,366 --> 00:07:11,600
[Saya] Mr. Maddo, is that
all you've got to say?

111
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:13,300
Oh, Lady Saya...

112
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,166
Um, I was just going
to let you know

113
00:07:15,266 --> 00:07:19,266
that we've finished the tune‐up
on the car, the Hum‐Vee
you came here in.

114
00:07:19,366 --> 00:07:21,466
[Saya]
Thank you. That'll be all.

115
00:07:24,033 --> 00:07:26,466
You come from such
a prestigious family.

116
00:07:26,566 --> 00:07:27,766
Wow!

117
00:07:27,866 --> 00:07:31,600
[Saya] As a matter of fact,
I do. Like that matters now.

118
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:34,166
And why would you let him
talk to you like that?

119
00:07:34,266 --> 00:07:36,066
Well because he's an adult.

120
00:07:36,166 --> 00:07:38,500
[Saya]
You think that means anything?

121
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:41,233
We've been through
just as much as they have.

122
00:07:41,333 --> 00:07:44,600
More! I'm sick of how
they're treating us.

123
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:50,466
We'd better talk to Komuro and
the others about this lack
of equity.

124
00:07:51,933 --> 00:07:54,266
[Yuriko] <i>I want her to</i>
<i>understand me,</i>

125
00:07:54,366 --> 00:07:57,600
<i>but no matter what I say,</i>
<i>she won't listen.</i>

126
00:07:58,833 --> 00:08:01,400
<i>Maybe you could talk to her?</i>

127
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:04,333
She thinks that I can
convince Takagi?

128
00:08:04,433 --> 00:08:08,566
I've never been able to
convince her of anything
in my whole life.

129
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,100
[door opening]

130
00:08:15,866 --> 00:08:19,366
I don't see a reason why
everyone has to gather
around here.

131
00:08:19,466 --> 00:08:21,666
[Takashi] You can barely move.

132
00:08:21,766 --> 00:08:23,000
What else can we do?

133
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:25,700
I'm sorry, but what are we
talking about again?

134
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:31,033
[Saya]
Whether we can continue to move
forward as a group or not.

135
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,933
As a group?

136
00:08:36,033 --> 00:08:39,233
It's a good point.
The group's bigger now.

137
00:08:39,333 --> 00:08:41,033
We might have to think
more democratically

138
00:08:41,133 --> 00:08:44,033
since there are more of us
than there were before.

139
00:08:44,133 --> 00:08:45,233
It's only fair.

140
00:08:45,333 --> 00:08:48,466
[Saya]
Right, we have only two options.

141
00:08:48,566 --> 00:08:50,866
Whether we're going
to be absorbed or...

142
00:08:50,966 --> 00:08:52,466
...separate from them.

143
00:08:52,566 --> 00:08:56,666
But wait, do you really think we
have to split from the group?

144
00:08:56,766 --> 00:08:59,033
[Takashi] Things are only
getting worse in the city,

145
00:08:59,133 --> 00:09:01,733
and your father seems to
know what he's doing.

146
00:09:02,566 --> 00:09:05,400
And your mother too.

147
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:07,233
They have a plan.

148
00:09:07,833 --> 00:09:09,600
Oh don't they always?

149
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:12,200
No one knows more than I do.

150
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,333
Her achievements...

151
00:09:15,433 --> 00:09:18,666
Don't think she won't shove them
right in your face.

152
00:09:18,766 --> 00:09:21,833
[Saya]
Maybe if she would've been as
dedicated at home as she was‐

153
00:09:21,933 --> 00:09:22,933
Takagi...

154
00:09:23,033 --> 00:09:25,100
[Saya] God she's such a bitch!

155
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,600
You shouldn't talk bad
about your parents.

156
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:29,866
[Takashi] Considering the
situation we're in,

157
00:09:29,966 --> 00:09:31,233
it's been really tough
for everyone.

158
00:09:31,333 --> 00:09:34,766
Did I ask you to weigh in
on my family life?!

159
00:09:34,866 --> 00:09:37,033
Takagis, the Takagis!

160
00:09:37,133 --> 00:09:39,166
How fabulous their life must be!

161
00:09:39,266 --> 00:09:41,366
[Saya] Everything had
to be just perfect.

162
00:09:41,466 --> 00:09:45,900
The house and the lawn and
the parties, and most of all,
their daughter!

163
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,900
It was positively sufficating!

164
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,633
They wanted to know where I was
and what I was doing every
minute of the day!

165
00:09:52,733 --> 00:09:54,033
The leash they kept me on!

166
00:09:54,133 --> 00:09:55,100
That's enough‐

167
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,200
[Saya] No! It was never enough!

168
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:58,900
But where was that
leash yesterday?!

169
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,100
When I was out there,
lost in the streets,
fighting for my life!

170
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,633
Where the hell were they?!

171
00:10:03,733 --> 00:10:05,533
Stop it, Saya!

172
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,766
[Saeko] Komuro!

173
00:10:10,866 --> 00:10:11,966
You...

174
00:10:12,066 --> 00:10:15,066
You don't know...
You have no idea...

175
00:10:15,166 --> 00:10:17,233
[Saya] What I feel...

176
00:10:17,333 --> 00:10:20,233
You don't know anything
about me...

177
00:10:20,966 --> 00:10:22,500
[Takashi] It's not just you.

178
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:27,400
We all feel the same way.
We all feel the same way!

179
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:29,266
Don't you know
how lucky you are?

180
00:10:29,366 --> 00:10:31,166
At least your parents are safe!

181
00:10:31,266 --> 00:10:33,200
[Takashi] So quit whining!

182
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,266
[Saya] Okay...

183
00:10:47,033 --> 00:10:50,533
You're right.
You can put me down now.

184
00:10:58,066 --> 00:10:59,633
I'm sorry.

185
00:10:59,733 --> 00:11:02,433
Yeah, you'd better be.

186
00:11:02,533 --> 00:11:05,033
I forgive you.

187
00:11:05,133 --> 00:11:07,266
[Saya] Now back to the subject.

188
00:11:07,366 --> 00:11:08,500
Do you think we should‐

189
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:11,266
[rumble] Huh?

190
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,300
[Takashi] That's...

191
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:23,233
Yes.

192
00:11:23,333 --> 00:11:25,233
He's the former lord
of Tokonosu.

193
00:11:25,333 --> 00:11:27,566
[Saya]
The head of the Takagi family.

194
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:33,600
The man who judges
everything by his rules.

195
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,766
My father!

196
00:11:47,933 --> 00:11:52,900
[wheezing]

197
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,533
[Soichiro] This man's name
is Tetsutaro Doi.

198
00:11:56,633 --> 00:12:01,900
He's the former retainer of the
family who had served the
Takagi family.

199
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,333
He is also my best friend.

200
00:12:05,366 --> 00:12:06,700
Today...

201
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:11,366
During the rescue operation,
an effort to save his
associates,

202
00:12:11,466 --> 00:12:12,666
he was bitten!

203
00:12:12,766 --> 00:12:16,400
[Soichiro] This is the ultimate
case of self‐sacrifice.

204
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:20,600
What he did was something noble.
Something any human being
could do.

205
00:12:21,133 --> 00:12:22,266
However...

206
00:12:22,366 --> 00:12:24,533
He is no longer a human.

207
00:12:24,633 --> 00:12:27,600
He's become something
extremely dangerous.

208
00:12:30,766 --> 00:12:32,700
That's why...

209
00:12:34,266 --> 00:12:36,533
As a man of the Takagi family,

210
00:12:36,633 --> 00:12:40,233
I shall fulfill my obligation
to the retainer!

211
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:47,600
[crash]

212
00:12:50,066 --> 00:12:52,333
So sorry, my baby is just...

213
00:13:14,233 --> 00:13:16,966
[Soichiro] This is
the present we're facing!

214
00:13:17,066 --> 00:13:21,600
And so, even if they're your
wonderful friends,

215
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:26,100
beloved family members and
people you once loved,

216
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:29,233
you must defeat them
without hesitation.

217
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:31,666
If you want to survive...

218
00:13:31,766 --> 00:13:33,266
[Soichiro] You must fight!

219
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,166
[Takashi]
What's the matter, Hirano?

220
00:13:51,266 --> 00:13:53,066
You don't look so well.

221
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:56,000
Swords are incredibly
inefficient.

222
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:57,766
What are you talking about?

223
00:13:57,866 --> 00:13:59,633
I said they're inefficient!

224
00:13:59,733 --> 00:14:02,400
The Japanese sword can break
if it hits bone.

225
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:05,266
It's useless after slicing
three or four people.

226
00:14:05,366 --> 00:14:08,233
[Saeko] You can't say that
for sure, Hirano.

227
00:14:08,333 --> 00:14:10,833
Even in the way of sword...

228
00:14:10,933 --> 00:14:13,133
numbers determine your strength.

229
00:14:13,233 --> 00:14:14,666
[Saeko]
The swordsman's technique,

230
00:14:14,766 --> 00:14:18,266
the quality of his sword,
his mental strength...

231
00:14:18,366 --> 00:14:22,300
If these three elements are at
high levels, you won't lose
your fighting strength,

232
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,800
no matter how many people you
have to fight against.

233
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:28,066
But once the sword has blood
on it, then it's impossible to‐

234
00:14:28,166 --> 00:14:30,800
Hey, Hirano, that's enough.

235
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:32,633
Don't touch me!

236
00:14:32,733 --> 00:14:33,933
[Kota] And don't interrupt me!

237
00:14:34,033 --> 00:14:36,833
You can't even shoot
a gun properly!

238
00:14:36,933 --> 00:14:39,700
Hirano, you need to back off!

239
00:14:40,733 --> 00:14:42,666
Hey, Hirano!

240
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:48,566
[Saeko] One big happy family.

241
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:54,066
[Arisu] Takashi!

242
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:59,500
What's wrong? Did you have
a fight with Kota?

243
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,566
No, he and I just...

244
00:15:01,666 --> 00:15:03,533
Yeah, I guess I did.

245
00:15:03,633 --> 00:15:07,666
[Arisu] Okay then,
I'll tell you something good.

246
00:15:07,766 --> 00:15:09,500
You need to talk to him again.

247
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,533
You just need to talk
to Kota some more

248
00:15:11,633 --> 00:15:14,666
and then you guys can
figure out what's wrong.

249
00:15:14,766 --> 00:15:16,600
So you think I can?

250
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:18,033
Sure, you can!

251
00:15:18,133 --> 00:15:20,400
After everything that's happened
before we got here,

252
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:23,233
you two can't have a fight now!

253
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:26,200
After everything
that's happened...

254
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:28,866
You both have been too close
to be mad.

255
00:15:28,966 --> 00:15:30,900
I'll tell him you want to talk!

256
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,033
Come on, Zero!

257
00:15:36,966 --> 00:15:39,333
[Takashi]
<i>Mutiny on the Bounty...</i>

258
00:15:42,233 --> 00:15:43,733
<i>I was in 8th grade.</i>

259
00:15:43,833 --> 00:15:47,033
<i>It was right before the</i>
<i>holiday weekend in the spring.</i>

260
00:15:47,133 --> 00:15:52,600
<i>My homeroom teacher was</i>
<i>really into history,</i>
<i>talked about the story to us.</i>

261
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:56,589
<i>It was the last class</i>
<i>before the holiday.</i>

262
00:15:56,689 --> 00:15:58,922
<i>In 1788, after a rough voyage,</i>

263
00:15:59,022 --> 00:16:02,822
<i>a British military ship</i>
<i>named Bounty reached</i>
<i>the island of Tahiti,</i>

264
00:16:02,922 --> 00:16:05,889
<i>the paradise in the</i>
<i>South Pacific Ocean.</i>

265
00:16:05,989 --> 00:16:10,022
<i>The ship left Tahiti</i>
<i>after spending about</i>
<i>six months there.</i>

266
00:16:10,122 --> 00:16:12,733
<i>Within a month after that,</i>
<i>a mutiny broke out.</i>

267
00:16:14,683 --> 00:16:19,690
<i>After months in paradise, the</i>
<i>crew couldn't take the life</i>
<i>they once knew on the Bounty.</i>

268
00:16:21,571 --> 00:16:25,059
<i>Our teacher made the</i>
<i>comparison of the</i>
<i>holiday weekend to Tahiti,</i>

269
00:16:25,159 --> 00:16:27,926
<i>and us to the crew</i>
<i>of the Bounty.</i>

270
00:16:28,026 --> 00:16:30,959
<i>I didn't understand what he</i>
<i>was talking about then.</i>

271
00:16:31,059 --> 00:16:34,759
<i>I didn't care. None of us did.</i>

272
00:16:34,859 --> 00:16:36,926
<i>It all makes sense to me now.</i>

273
00:16:37,459 --> 00:16:39,092
[Saya] Takashi!

274
00:16:41,159 --> 00:16:43,292
Hurry up and come with me!
Kota...

275
00:16:43,392 --> 00:16:45,259
Kota's in big trouble!

276
00:16:45,359 --> 00:16:47,426
We have to go to him now!

277
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,081
[Saya] Where the hell did he go?

278
00:16:57,181 --> 00:17:00,214
Jeez, he moves pretty fast
for a fat ass.

279
00:17:12,247 --> 00:17:15,314
These German koi are
simply beautiful.

280
00:17:15,414 --> 00:17:17,981
[Saeko] You don't get to see
this just anywhere.

281
00:17:18,081 --> 00:17:19,447
It's quite unusual.

282
00:17:19,547 --> 00:17:21,014
So, you're an expert in kendo,

283
00:17:21,114 --> 00:17:24,314
and you have a part‐time
job at Petsmart?

284
00:17:24,414 --> 00:17:27,181
You sound like you have it
all figured out.

285
00:17:32,114 --> 00:17:34,181
[Saeko]
I'm good at a lot of things.

286
00:17:37,181 --> 00:17:39,481
But how would you know
what I sound like?

287
00:17:39,581 --> 00:17:40,647
[thud]

288
00:17:40,747 --> 00:17:42,614
Guh! I won't do it!

289
00:17:42,714 --> 00:17:43,981
[Kota] Give me a break!

290
00:17:44,081 --> 00:17:46,414
Hand it over, fat boy!

291
00:17:46,514 --> 00:17:47,481
Come on.

292
00:17:47,581 --> 00:17:49,314
You know what's
going on out there.

293
00:17:49,414 --> 00:17:52,381
You really shouldn't keep
a weapon like that
all to yourself.

294
00:17:52,481 --> 00:17:53,847
You should give it to
someone who‐

295
00:17:53,947 --> 00:17:54,981
I said no!

296
00:17:55,081 --> 00:17:56,847
I'm borrowing these
from someone.

297
00:17:56,947 --> 00:18:02,181
Besides, no one here can use
any of these weapons
better than I can!

298
00:18:03,981 --> 00:18:08,581
[Saya] I don't mean to rain
on your parade, my little
Miss Life Aquatic.

299
00:18:08,681 --> 00:18:10,747
But you have realized
what's happened?

300
00:18:10,847 --> 00:18:14,547
That there are no more koi
ponds and kendo tournaments.

301
00:18:14,647 --> 00:18:18,714
Things have changed.
Those days are over.

302
00:18:18,814 --> 00:18:20,314
That's right...

303
00:18:20,414 --> 00:18:23,614
The world that
we once enjoyed...

304
00:18:23,714 --> 00:18:25,681
that world is long gone.

305
00:18:26,814 --> 00:18:28,314
Go ahead...

306
00:18:30,181 --> 00:18:31,347
You know what to do.

307
00:18:31,447 --> 00:18:34,147
We don't have time
for this kid's whining!

308
00:18:35,947 --> 00:18:37,447
Hirano!

309
00:18:38,047 --> 00:18:39,581
[Saeko] So tell me,

310
00:18:39,681 --> 00:18:42,647
you still have something
to get off your chest, do you?

311
00:18:42,747 --> 00:18:43,981
I do.

312
00:18:44,081 --> 00:18:46,381
I wanna know
where you stand on this.

313
00:18:46,481 --> 00:18:50,581
Are you going to stay here with
them, or go out on our own?

314
00:18:50,681 --> 00:18:53,481
[Soichiro]
What the hell is all this?

315
00:19:01,614 --> 00:19:03,014
M‐Master!

316
00:19:03,114 --> 00:19:04,347
He's just a kid, sir.

317
00:19:04,447 --> 00:19:07,214
H‐He doesn't have any business
with these guns.

318
00:19:10,147 --> 00:19:12,114
[Soichiro] I'm Soichiro Takagi,

319
00:19:12,214 --> 00:19:14,714
former lord of Tokonosu,

320
00:19:14,814 --> 00:19:17,081
the master of Tendo Sogon‐ryu!

321
00:19:17,181 --> 00:19:20,047
What is your name, young man?

322
00:19:20,147 --> 00:19:22,247
Ko‐Ko‐Kota Hirano!

323
00:19:22,347 --> 00:19:24,014
I got to Fujimi Academy.

324
00:19:24,114 --> 00:19:27,014
I'm in Class 2‐B,
roster number 32.

325
00:19:27,114 --> 00:19:29,714
Something tells me
that you have spirit.

326
00:19:29,814 --> 00:19:34,714
I'm quite sure that you went
through a lot before you made
it all the way here.

327
00:19:34,814 --> 00:19:37,981
[Soichiro] I take it you
don't intend to hand over
your weapons?

328
00:19:38,081 --> 00:19:40,081
N‐No, sir, I don't want to!

329
00:19:40,181 --> 00:19:42,847
Without the gun,
I'm going right back

330
00:19:42,947 --> 00:19:44,914
to the way I was before!

331
00:19:45,014 --> 00:19:47,281
They'll make fun of me again!

332
00:19:47,381 --> 00:19:49,214
I don't want to go back there!

333
00:19:49,314 --> 00:19:51,947
I've finally figured out
what I can do!

334
00:19:52,047 --> 00:19:54,247
What exactly can you do?

335
00:19:54,347 --> 00:19:56,581
[Soichiro] Tell me!

336
00:19:56,681 --> 00:19:58,114
Well I can...

337
00:19:58,214 --> 00:20:00,714
I can... I can...

338
00:20:01,781 --> 00:20:04,547
[Takashi] He can protect
your daughter, sir!

339
00:20:08,514 --> 00:20:10,714
K‐Komuro...

340
00:20:11,947 --> 00:20:14,214
Komuro? Interesting.

341
00:20:14,314 --> 00:20:16,747
Yes, that name sounds
familiar to me.

342
00:20:16,847 --> 00:20:20,847
You were friends with my
daughter since she was little,
were you not?

343
00:20:20,947 --> 00:20:22,381
Yes sir, still am.

344
00:20:22,481 --> 00:20:25,214
But Hirano has been the one
who's been protecting her.

345
00:20:25,314 --> 00:20:27,047
We've all been
working together, sir.

346
00:20:27,147 --> 00:20:29,181
He keeps the guns.

347
00:20:31,114 --> 00:20:32,781
[Arisu] Kota!

348
00:20:35,447 --> 00:20:39,881
I'll have you know, I've seen
his bravery with my own eyes.

349
00:20:39,981 --> 00:20:42,247
[Saya] Me too, Daddy!

350
00:20:48,614 --> 00:20:52,347
[Saya] He's just a
loser military otaku,

351
00:20:52,447 --> 00:20:56,581
but without him I would've
been one of those zombies
by now, Daddy.

352
00:20:57,847 --> 00:20:59,481
That's right!

353
00:20:59,581 --> 00:21:01,914
He's the one who's been
protecting me!

354
00:21:02,014 --> 00:21:04,214
He did your job!

355
00:21:05,114 --> 00:21:08,481
Takagi... Thank you.

356
00:22:50,114 --> 00:22:51,147
[Maruyama] Yes...

357
00:22:51,247 --> 00:22:54,314
Yes, that's correct.

358
00:22:54,414 --> 00:22:57,481
Right, getting ready to
get away from here.

359
00:22:58,681 --> 00:23:00,114
If you ask for help now,

360
00:23:00,214 --> 00:23:02,681
I'm sure they'll let you in.
They seem nice.

361
00:23:03,547 --> 00:23:05,214
Mr. Shido!
