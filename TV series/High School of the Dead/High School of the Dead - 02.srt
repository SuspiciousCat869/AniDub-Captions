1
00:00:04,822 --> 00:00:07,989
[student] Move! I'm gonna
frickin' kill you, son of
a bitch!

2
00:00:08,089 --> 00:00:10,822
[panic]

3
00:00:14,122 --> 00:00:15,522
<i>People are eating people.</i>

4
00:00:15,622 --> 00:00:17,622
<i>This isn't even funny.</i>

5
00:00:17,722 --> 00:00:21,289
Can't be...
this can't be happening...

6
00:00:21,389 --> 00:00:22,922
Can it, Mommy?

7
00:00:23,022 --> 00:00:24,989
It's not, right?!

8
00:00:27,755 --> 00:00:30,655
Takagi, where do you think
you're running to?

9
00:00:30,755 --> 00:00:33,055
And what exactly was your
brilliant plan?

10
00:00:33,155 --> 00:00:35,922
I was gonna talk to the teachers
in the faculty room and then go
to th‐

11
00:00:36,022 --> 00:00:37,622
[Saya] That's pointless!

12
00:00:37,722 --> 00:00:40,689
What do you think a bunch of
stupid teachers can do about it?

13
00:00:41,822 --> 00:00:43,122
But, Takagi...

14
00:00:43,222 --> 00:00:45,655
This is just... It's kinda...

15
00:00:46,289 --> 00:00:48,222
Because of this I...

16
00:00:48,322 --> 00:00:49,655
[Kota] I should...

17
00:00:49,755 --> 00:00:51,955
[Saya] I've got a question
for you.

18
00:00:52,055 --> 00:00:53,655
[Kota] What is it?

19
00:00:53,755 --> 00:00:57,455
Do you want to die or do
you want to live?

20
00:00:57,555 --> 00:01:00,422
[Kota] Well, that's... Um...

21
00:01:00,522 --> 00:01:01,455
[knocking]

22
00:01:01,555 --> 00:01:03,189
They had the same idea as you.

23
00:01:03,289 --> 00:01:05,022
[Saya] Let's see how it works
for them.

24
00:01:05,122 --> 00:01:06,855
[students] Sir! Sir!

25
00:01:10,622 --> 00:01:12,155
You want to live, right?!

26
00:01:12,255 --> 00:01:14,422
Then stick with me!

27
00:01:15,755 --> 00:01:17,255
[Saya] Let's go, chubby!

28
00:01:17,355 --> 00:01:19,089
[hurried footsteps]

29
00:03:12,622 --> 00:03:16,689
[Hisashi] <i>Come on, do it for me.</i>

30
00:03:16,789 --> 00:03:20,555
I want to stay myself until
the end.

31
00:03:20,655 --> 00:03:21,922
[Rei] He's not turning!

32
00:03:22,022 --> 00:03:26,722
He's not turning into one
of them! Don't do it!

33
00:03:36,089 --> 00:03:37,555
What's the matter?

34
00:03:37,655 --> 00:03:40,689
[Takashi] I was thinking what
the hell is really going on.

35
00:03:40,789 --> 00:03:42,555
[Rei] That's a
straightforward answer.

36
00:03:42,655 --> 00:03:45,055
[Rei] What's the point of lying
about it?

37
00:03:55,155 --> 00:03:58,022
I think I should let my dad
know that I'm all right.

38
00:03:58,122 --> 00:03:59,422
Let me use your cell?

39
00:03:59,522 --> 00:04:04,555
[Takashi] I understand that he's
a police officer, but we can't
even connect to 110.

40
00:04:04,655 --> 00:04:08,922
[Rei] I know this secret number
that he told me not to call
unless it's an emergency.

41
00:04:09,022 --> 00:04:12,455
[ringing]

42
00:04:12,555 --> 00:04:13,389
It got through!

43
00:04:13,489 --> 00:04:15,422
Dad?!
[Tadashi] Hello?

44
00:04:15,522 --> 00:04:17,855
Takashi? Is that you?

45
00:04:17,955 --> 00:04:20,189
Dad listen! Daddy we're at
school there's be‐

46
00:04:20,289 --> 00:04:23,389
[Tadashi] Hello, Takashi?
You must have got this
number from Rei.

47
00:04:23,489 --> 00:04:25,689
Is Rei okay?! Is she with you?!
Are you both‐

48
00:04:25,789 --> 00:04:28,022
Daddy! What's the matter?
Can't you hear me?!

49
00:04:28,122 --> 00:04:30,089
[Tadashi] Listen carefully.
The entire city is in

50
00:04:30,189 --> 00:04:31,889
[Tadashi] panic mode right now.
[Rei] Daddy! Dad‐

51
00:04:31,989 --> 00:04:33,189
[gunshot]

52
00:04:33,289 --> 00:04:35,522
[Tadashi] You need to get out
of there! You understand?!

53
00:04:35,622 --> 00:04:37,422
The city is already in
panic mode!

54
00:04:37,522 --> 00:04:38,422
You need to evacu‐

55
00:04:38,522 --> 00:04:40,122
[phone cuts out]

56
00:04:42,989 --> 00:04:44,422
[Rei] No service?!

57
00:04:44,522 --> 00:04:46,855
But I just called him!

58
00:04:46,955 --> 00:04:48,255
I don't understand!

59
00:04:48,355 --> 00:04:50,422
Rei!

60
00:04:52,855 --> 00:04:54,955
Takashi...

61
00:04:55,055 --> 00:04:56,755
[Rei] My dad...

62
00:04:56,855 --> 00:05:02,989
He didn't know that it was me at
all. He didn't even know me!

63
00:05:05,122 --> 00:05:09,555
[Kota] Takagi, I know it's
against school rules, but do
you have your cell phone on you?

64
00:05:09,655 --> 00:05:12,322
[Saya] I'm a straight‐A student!

65
00:05:12,422 --> 00:05:15,289
Besides, even if I had one,
who would I call?

66
00:05:15,389 --> 00:05:17,355
[Kota] Well, the police maybe?

67
00:05:17,455 --> 00:05:19,489
God, you're so stupid.

68
00:05:19,589 --> 00:05:21,055
Look how serious this is.

69
00:05:21,155 --> 00:05:23,655
There's no way people haven't
called them already,

70
00:05:23,755 --> 00:05:27,455
but yet we haven't heard
a single siren.

71
00:05:27,555 --> 00:05:29,355
[Saya] So, now you know.

72
00:05:29,455 --> 00:05:32,155
So this is happening all over?

73
00:05:32,255 --> 00:05:33,655
Gee, ya think?!

74
00:05:33,755 --> 00:05:35,522
I'm sure the police have been
dealing with this already,

75
00:05:35,622 --> 00:05:37,289
but look at how things are.

76
00:05:37,389 --> 00:05:40,289
[Kota] I wonder if we should
call the Self‐Defense Force
or something?

77
00:05:40,389 --> 00:05:42,289
[Saya] I wouldn't expect
much from them.

78
00:05:42,389 --> 00:05:45,455
[Kota] I know that they can't
conduct any defense or public
security operations...

79
00:05:45,555 --> 00:05:47,255
without government's
order, but...

80
00:05:47,355 --> 00:05:48,689
That's not what I meant!

81
00:05:48,789 --> 00:05:51,222
Well, what did you mean exactly?

82
00:05:51,322 --> 00:05:53,255
They're just like the police.

83
00:05:53,355 --> 00:05:58,089
What do you think would happen
if people were eating people
in all the cities out there?

84
00:05:58,189 --> 00:05:59,122
[Saya] Listen:

85
00:05:59,222 --> 00:06:01,222
There are 130 million people.

86
00:06:01,322 --> 00:06:04,155
How many of them do you think
work for the Self‐Defense Force?

87
00:06:04,255 --> 00:06:09,722
And what if the same things have
been happening inside the
Self‐Defense Force?

88
00:06:11,722 --> 00:06:15,455
[Saya] Come on! We need to go!
[Kota] Ah! Okay!

89
00:06:15,555 --> 00:06:19,055
[Saya] <i>Jesus! The only reason</i>
<i>I have to stay with</i>
<i>this dumbass...</i>

90
00:06:19,155 --> 00:06:21,122
<i>is because Komuro isn't here.</i>

91
00:06:21,222 --> 00:06:23,022
<i>I'm such a nice person.</i>

92
00:06:23,655 --> 00:06:25,855
[Ishii] O...Okada...

93
00:06:28,989 --> 00:06:30,855
Okada?!

94
00:06:34,222 --> 00:06:36,455
Damn it!

95
00:06:37,355 --> 00:06:39,289
[Ishii] Forgive me! Forgive me!

96
00:06:39,389 --> 00:06:40,855
Forgive me! Forgive me!

97
00:06:40,955 --> 00:06:42,089
Forgive me! Forgive me!
Forgive me!

98
00:06:42,189 --> 00:06:43,722
What should I do?

99
00:06:45,922 --> 00:06:49,089
[Shizuka] I can't get hold
of the police or the
fire department.

100
00:06:49,189 --> 00:06:52,522
I can treat them, but once
they're bitten, they're
bound to die.

101
00:06:52,622 --> 00:06:55,922
And once they die,
they'll resurrect.

102
00:06:56,022 --> 00:07:00,355
This is exactly like that George
Romeo movie I once saw.

103
00:07:00,455 --> 00:07:02,489
I don't think it's the time
to be impressed!

104
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:04,289
[Ishii] Let's get out of here,
Miss Shizuka!

105
00:07:04,389 --> 00:07:05,655
Hold on a second.

106
00:07:05,755 --> 00:07:08,489
[Shizuka] Let me take all the
stuff I can carry.

107
00:07:08,589 --> 00:07:09,755
[Ishii] Just do it quickly.

108
00:07:09,855 --> 00:07:10,989
[crack]

109
00:07:13,355 --> 00:07:15,422
Miss Shizuka!

110
00:07:17,555 --> 00:07:19,822
Miss Shizuka,
get out of here, quick!

111
00:07:19,922 --> 00:07:25,055
Hey, I'm sorry, what was your
name again, please?

112
00:07:25,155 --> 00:07:27,022
What?

113
00:07:31,122 --> 00:07:32,989
Oh goodness...

114
00:07:36,755 --> 00:07:38,455
Huh?

115
00:07:51,089 --> 00:07:56,055
I'm the captain of the
kendo club, Saeko Busujima,
a sophomore.

116
00:07:56,155 --> 00:07:57,689
What's your name, kid?

117
00:07:59,122 --> 00:08:02,022
I..Ishii Kazu...

118
00:08:04,022 --> 00:08:07,455
[Saeko] Ishii, you did a great
job protecting Dr. Marikawa.

119
00:08:07,555 --> 00:08:09,755
I commend your courage.

120
00:08:09,855 --> 00:08:13,055
You do know what happens to you
once you get bitten.

121
00:08:13,155 --> 00:08:16,355
Do you want your parents or
friends to see you like that?

122
00:08:16,455 --> 00:08:17,655
If the answer is no,

123
00:08:17,755 --> 00:08:20,855
I will end your life as
painlessly as I can,

124
00:08:20,955 --> 00:08:23,622
but I've never killed
anyone before.

125
00:08:24,955 --> 00:08:27,555
Pl... Please do that.

126
00:08:28,322 --> 00:08:29,889
Wait, what are you gonna do?

127
00:08:29,989 --> 00:08:33,422
[Saeko] You're the school
doctor, I got it.
But stay out of it.

128
00:08:33,522 --> 00:08:36,355
This young man is going to die
with honor.

129
00:08:36,455 --> 00:08:39,022
And I'm going to make sure that
he does.

130
00:08:53,122 --> 00:08:54,455
[crash]

131
00:09:02,489 --> 00:09:05,455
[Kota] Okay, we're here,
but what do we do now?

132
00:09:05,555 --> 00:09:07,255
Although, I do see some things
that would come in‐

133
00:09:07,355 --> 00:09:09,822
Just shut up, you chubby‐geek.

134
00:09:09,922 --> 00:09:11,922
[Saya] Lock the door so
they won't come in.

135
00:09:12,955 --> 00:09:16,455
[Kota] I..I locked it.

136
00:09:19,773 --> 00:09:20,745
Are you going to use them
as weapons?

137
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:23,230
You're one of those
basement shut‐in's,

138
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:25,830
one of those "military nerds" or
"gun geeks", aren't you?

139
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:30,930
Come on, at least you've seen
this thing before. I mean it was
in that Mel Gibson movie.

140
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:33,964
A nail gun...
And it's gas.

141
00:09:34,064 --> 00:09:35,164
[Saya] Hell yeah!

142
00:09:35,264 --> 00:09:36,530
We won't be able to carry
it around...

143
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:39,697
if it was one of those
compressor types, right?

144
00:09:39,797 --> 00:09:41,997
God, you're fat and stupid.

145
00:09:42,097 --> 00:09:43,730
[Kota] So you like movies?

146
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:45,097
Don't be ridiculous!

147
00:09:45,197 --> 00:09:47,364
I'm a genius, so I
know everything...

148
00:09:47,464 --> 00:09:50,097
[bang]

149
00:09:50,197 --> 00:09:53,330
[Kota] We got an extra tank,
and the nails...

150
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:54,830
We're all set.

151
00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:57,097
Why are you so calm, cool
and collected?

152
00:09:57,197 --> 00:09:58,164
They're coming!

153
00:09:58,264 --> 00:10:00,930
[Saya] They're in the hallway!

154
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:02,964
It weighs around four kilograms.

155
00:10:03,064 --> 00:10:05,230
It's as heavy as some old
assault rifle.

156
00:10:05,330 --> 00:10:07,664
But I can't stabilize
my aim this way.

157
00:10:07,764 --> 00:10:08,964
I need to attach a sight too it.

158
00:10:09,064 --> 00:10:11,697
Hey, you, are you listening
to me?!

159
00:10:15,697 --> 00:10:18,230
[Saya] Hi..Hirano?

160
00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:25,564
[scream]

161
00:10:26,064 --> 00:10:27,397
Hirano!

162
00:10:31,597 --> 00:10:33,197
Gotcha!

163
00:10:33,297 --> 00:10:35,164
Hirano?

164
00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:38,197
Are you ready?

165
00:10:38,297 --> 00:10:40,197
Yeah!

166
00:10:40,297 --> 00:10:42,097
[Takashi] Now turn it!

167
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:48,964
Shit!

168
00:10:51,530 --> 00:10:53,497
You see the drill and the nails
over there?

169
00:10:53,597 --> 00:10:55,797
Will you put them in a bag
or something?

170
00:10:55,897 --> 00:10:57,964
Excuse me?!
You're nobody to me.

171
00:10:58,064 --> 00:11:02,364
What makes you think you can
order me around?

172
00:11:02,464 --> 00:11:04,597
Pretty please with sugar on top?

173
00:11:07,064 --> 00:11:08,664
All right.

174
00:11:09,364 --> 00:11:10,464
Takashi!

175
00:11:10,564 --> 00:11:13,230
I'm okay.

176
00:11:13,330 --> 00:11:15,330
[Takashi] I didn't like most of
you fucks then...

177
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:18,697
and I sure as hell don't
like you now!

178
00:11:18,797 --> 00:11:20,530
Take this!

179
00:11:26,797 --> 00:11:28,030
[Saya] Hey, what are you doing?

180
00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:29,830
You hold this too.

181
00:11:29,930 --> 00:11:32,330
[Kota] Um, okay...

182
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:36,630
Hey, Takagi, can I‐ can I ask
you something?

183
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:37,897
What?

184
00:11:37,997 --> 00:11:40,830
[Kota] Well, why are you
with me?

185
00:11:40,930 --> 00:11:44,230
Why? Because I'm such a
nice person.

186
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:49,630
Yeah, I can see that. Oh well.

187
00:11:51,064 --> 00:11:53,664
Hey, you're on the ball all
of a sudden.

188
00:11:53,764 --> 00:11:56,264
Something click in you or what?

189
00:11:56,364 --> 00:11:58,564
I think I found my calling!

190
00:11:59,664 --> 00:12:01,264
[Saya] Behind you!

191
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:13,230
[Takashi] The fire hose...
Not too shabby.

192
00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:15,930
I figured the water pressure
would be strong enough.

193
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:17,330
Don't you remember?

194
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:19,564
During the fire drill when we
were in junior high,

195
00:12:19,664 --> 00:12:21,164
[Saya] Hisashi and you got...

196
00:12:24,197 --> 00:12:26,964
[Takashi] Yeah, I remember.

197
00:12:29,097 --> 00:12:31,264
[Rei] I think it should be
okay now.

198
00:12:31,364 --> 00:12:33,730
How I admire your optimism.

199
00:12:33,830 --> 00:12:36,130
You sure about this?

200
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:46,430
Let's go!

201
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:03,630
[footsteps]

202
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:07,297
[Rei] Where do we run to?

203
00:13:07,397 --> 00:13:08,364
To my house.

204
00:13:08,464 --> 00:13:10,030
Go there, get supplies we need,

205
00:13:10,130 --> 00:13:12,997
and meet up with other people
who haven't turned yet.

206
00:13:13,097 --> 00:13:15,164
Work together and get
some place safe.

207
00:13:15,264 --> 00:13:17,130
Sounds like a plan to me.

208
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:18,697
Y..Yeah, you're right!

209
00:13:18,797 --> 00:13:20,530
Now that I know that
my dad's okay...

210
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:24,597
Oh, we should probably call your
house to make sure they're all
right too.

211
00:13:24,697 --> 00:13:26,197
Waste of time; Nobody's home.

212
00:13:26,297 --> 00:13:28,430
My dad won't be back in town
till next week...

213
00:13:28,530 --> 00:13:32,030
and my mom's a school teacher
so she won't be home until
after 5.

214
00:13:32,130 --> 00:13:35,230
Besides, they get on my nerves.

215
00:13:35,330 --> 00:13:38,697
Well they're parents. That kind
of comes with the job.

216
00:13:41,130 --> 00:13:43,130
[Takashi] <i>I didn't really</i>
<i>mean that.</i>

217
00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:46,264
<i>The truth is I was a</i>
<i>little scared.</i>

218
00:13:47,064 --> 00:13:48,430
<i>Look at this place.</i>

219
00:13:49,797 --> 00:13:53,730
<i>And my mom... she's some place</i>
<i>just like this.</i>

220
00:14:07,764 --> 00:14:09,997
[Kota] Wh..What are you doing?

221
00:14:10,097 --> 00:14:12,197
Just be quiet.

222
00:14:18,330 --> 00:14:23,997
Do you see that? They don't even
react when something hits their
bodies, the big dumbasses.

223
00:14:24,097 --> 00:14:25,264
[Saya] Their senses are dead.

224
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:27,397
They only respond to the sound.

225
00:14:27,497 --> 00:14:28,997
Most likely they can't
see either.

226
00:14:29,097 --> 00:14:31,730
Otherwise, they wouldn't bump
into the locker.

227
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:33,197
Well, what about heat?

228
00:14:33,297 --> 00:14:36,064
I'm sure we'll get plenty of
opportunities to find out.

229
00:14:36,164 --> 00:14:37,130
[Saya] Let's go.

230
00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:39,230
So, we're‐ we're going outside?

231
00:14:39,330 --> 00:14:40,764
You think we're hanging
around here?

232
00:14:40,864 --> 00:14:43,897
I kinda... I hate walking.

233
00:14:43,997 --> 00:14:45,730
And that's why you're so fat!

234
00:14:45,830 --> 00:14:49,697
You need to put down the
Walmart Cheetos and exercise!

235
00:14:49,797 --> 00:14:51,164
[gasp]
[Kota] What?

236
00:15:00,297 --> 00:15:01,997
[Saeko] The faculty room?

237
00:15:02,097 --> 00:15:04,397
Jesus, what a pain in the ass.

238
00:15:04,497 --> 00:15:08,430
But all the car keys are in
that room. That's where they
keep them.

239
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:13,830
[Shizuka] Why don't you just
kill them?

240
00:15:13,930 --> 00:15:15,930
You've done so well this far,
why stop now?

241
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:21,030
One or two at a time, believe
me, no problem. And I wouldn't
think twice about doing it.

242
00:15:21,130 --> 00:15:22,664
But they come at you in packs.

243
00:15:22,764 --> 00:15:25,464
And don't be fooled, they're a
lot stronger than they look.

244
00:15:25,564 --> 00:15:28,430
Once they grab you, it's hard
to get loose.

245
00:15:28,530 --> 00:15:31,297
Wow, I'm impressed.

246
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:36,397
Ow! I hate these stupid
floor mats! Jeez!

247
00:15:36,497 --> 00:15:39,497
What you're wearing isn't
exactly made for running.

248
00:15:40,764 --> 00:15:42,097
What?

249
00:15:43,764 --> 00:15:47,630
[Shizuka] Are you crazy?!
This is Christian Dior!

250
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:49,830
Your clothes or your life?

251
00:15:49,930 --> 00:15:52,130
Which one is more important?

252
00:15:52,564 --> 00:15:53,464
Both are!

253
00:15:53,564 --> 00:15:55,730
[crash]

254
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:56,897
What was that?

255
00:15:56,997 --> 00:15:58,734
It came from the faculty room.

256
00:16:07,345 --> 00:16:09,330
[Saya] If you keep shooting
them, how will we learn
about them?

257
00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:11,463
[Kota] You know, you could help
me fight 'em too!

258
00:16:11,563 --> 00:16:14,230
You stupid, fat idiot!
That's what I have you for!

259
00:16:14,330 --> 00:16:16,563
[Kota] The magazine is
almost empty!

260
00:16:16,663 --> 00:16:18,030
You think that's my problem?

261
00:16:18,130 --> 00:16:20,397
Hurry up and just reload it!

262
00:16:20,497 --> 00:16:22,163
But they're‐ they're right
behind you...

263
00:16:22,263 --> 00:16:24,030
[Saya] Huh?
[Kota] See?

264
00:16:25,863 --> 00:16:29,063
[scream]

265
00:16:34,063 --> 00:16:36,230
Hi..Hirano!

266
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:37,030
[click]

267
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:39,263
Oh no! I'm out!

268
00:16:42,597 --> 00:16:45,697
Get away... Get away!

269
00:16:45,797 --> 00:16:47,597
Takagi!

270
00:16:47,697 --> 00:16:48,763
[Saya] Get back!

271
00:16:48,863 --> 00:16:51,197
Stay back!

272
00:17:02,697 --> 00:17:03,797
Get away!

273
00:17:03,897 --> 00:17:07,063
[whir]

274
00:17:18,663 --> 00:17:20,463
I can't take it anymore!

275
00:17:20,563 --> 00:17:22,463
Someone please!

276
00:17:24,830 --> 00:17:26,697
[Saeko] I'll take the
right side.

277
00:17:26,797 --> 00:17:27,663
[Takashi] Rei!

278
00:17:27,763 --> 00:17:29,330
[Rei] I'll hold the left.

279
00:17:31,897 --> 00:17:33,763
Oh?

280
00:17:53,597 --> 00:17:58,730
[sobbing]

281
00:18:03,497 --> 00:18:05,363
Takagi...

282
00:18:06,130 --> 00:18:08,397
Takagi, are you okay?

283
00:18:08,497 --> 00:18:10,363
[Saya] Miyamoto...

284
00:18:12,430 --> 00:18:15,363
[Saeko] You already know
the school doctor,
Marikawa, right?

285
00:18:15,463 --> 00:18:18,097
And I'm Saeko Busujima from
Class 3‐A.

286
00:18:18,197 --> 00:18:20,597
I'm Takashi Komuro from
Class 2‐B.

287
00:18:20,697 --> 00:18:25,030
Miss Busujima, I remember you
won the national championship
last year.

288
00:18:25,130 --> 00:18:27,597
I'm Rei Miyamoto. I'm in the
spear martial arts club.

289
00:18:27,697 --> 00:18:32,697
Oh and I'm Kota Hirano from
Class B, just F.Y.I.

290
00:18:32,797 --> 00:18:34,763
Nice to meet you.

291
00:18:37,763 --> 00:18:40,897
[Saya] Why are you guys
being all warm and fuzzy?

292
00:18:40,997 --> 00:18:43,230
Why are you being so polite
to her, Miyamoto?

293
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:46,397
You flunked last year,
you're the same age,
she's not your elder.

294
00:18:46,497 --> 00:18:48,097
[Kota] What are you talking
about, Takagi?

295
00:18:48,197 --> 00:18:49,863
Don't talk to me like
I'm stupid!

296
00:18:49,963 --> 00:18:51,663
I'm a smarter than all of
you combined!

297
00:18:51,763 --> 00:18:54,997
You should be lucky I'm even in
the same school as you!

298
00:18:55,097 --> 00:18:58,597
I'm a... I'm a...

299
00:19:00,330 --> 00:19:03,597
[Saeko] It's okay,
that's enough.

300
00:19:08,597 --> 00:19:13,363
Look at me. All of these
blood stains...

301
00:19:13,463 --> 00:19:17,330
Now mom will have to take
it to the cleaners.

302
00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:47,663
[wailing]

303
00:21:33,930 --> 00:21:35,763
[Takashi] What do you think?
[Kota] Yeah.

304
00:21:35,863 --> 00:21:37,963
I think that's enough right now.

305
00:21:38,063 --> 00:21:40,130
Let's take a quick break.

306
00:21:44,597 --> 00:21:48,430
Hey, just wondering...
Are you okay?

307
00:21:49,997 --> 00:21:50,897
Huh?

308
00:21:50,997 --> 00:21:53,363
You... wear glasses?

309
00:21:53,463 --> 00:21:57,330
Shut up! My contact
lenses keep on moving around.

310
00:22:00,763 --> 00:22:02,730
She wears glasses...

311
00:22:03,997 --> 00:22:05,397
Here you go...

312
00:22:05,497 --> 00:22:07,697
Oh, thanks.

313
00:22:07,797 --> 00:22:10,163
Dr. Marikawa, where's the
car key?

314
00:22:10,263 --> 00:22:12,730
Oh, it's in my purse somewhere.

315
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:15,363
Are you sure your car is big
enough to fit all of us?

316
00:22:15,463 --> 00:22:17,497
[Shizuka] Well, now that I
think about it...

317
00:22:17,597 --> 00:22:20,497
What about the microbus we
use for the clubs' away games?

318
00:22:20,597 --> 00:22:23,030
Looks like the keys are
on the wall hook.

319
00:22:23,130 --> 00:22:24,663
Hey guys, I see the bus.

320
00:22:24,763 --> 00:22:27,197
[Shizuka] That's fine, but where
are we going?

321
00:22:27,297 --> 00:22:29,463
We're going to make sure that
our families are okay.

322
00:22:29,563 --> 00:22:31,930
We'll start with the family who
lives closest from here.

323
00:22:32,030 --> 00:22:34,630
If you're worried about your
family, we'll bring them
with us.

324
00:22:34,730 --> 00:22:38,597
[Takashi] After that, we'll look
for a safe place and...

325
00:22:38,697 --> 00:22:40,463
What's wrong?

326
00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:45,730
[Rei] What is this?

327
00:22:47,230 --> 00:22:48,963
[Takashi] What's wrong, Rei?

328
00:22:49,063 --> 00:22:51,097
[reporter] The government
has begun to consider the
emergency measures...

329
00:22:51,197 --> 00:22:54,330
against the outbreaks that have
been occurring in locations
around the city.

330
00:22:54,430 --> 00:22:55,830
However, all the
political parties‐

331
00:22:55,930 --> 00:22:58,897
Outbreaks? What do they
mean "outbreaks"?

332
00:22:58,997 --> 00:23:03,630
It's been feared that more than
10,000 have been victimized
in Saitama area so far.

333
00:23:03,730 --> 00:23:06,263
The governor has already
called for the‐
[gunshot]

334
00:23:06,363 --> 00:23:08,197
Already declared the state
of emergency...

335
00:23:08,297 --> 00:23:10,963
and requested the emergency
disaster relief...

336
00:23:11,063 --> 00:23:15,230
It's a gunshot. It looks like
the police are finally using
firearms!

337
00:23:15,330 --> 00:23:17,297
From what I can see, they're...

338
00:23:17,397 --> 00:23:18,830
No... No!

339
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:22,230
[scream]
