1
00:00:03,333 --> 00:00:06,133
[Takashi] <i>There's no way I</i>
<i>would have known.</i>

2
00:00:06,233 --> 00:00:08,200
<i>How could any of us have known?</i>

3
00:00:09,466 --> 00:00:10,600
[bang]

4
00:00:12,366 --> 00:00:13,500
[bang]

5
00:00:15,266 --> 00:00:18,033
Who did it?
Who let them on the plane?

6
00:00:18,133 --> 00:00:21,666
Aw, Jesus!
They bit the First Lady!

7
00:00:21,766 --> 00:00:24,600
[chairman] Mr. President,
you have to enter the code!

8
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:26,066
[bang]
I can't...

9
00:00:26,166 --> 00:00:27,833
[chairman]
You and I have been bitten!

10
00:00:27,933 --> 00:00:29,233
You've got to listen to me!

11
00:00:29,333 --> 00:00:30,800
There's not a country on
this planet...

12
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:34,400
that's going to let us land
Air Force One on their soil!

13
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:36,800
That's why we have to attack
those countries who'd use...

14
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:41,466
intercontinental ballistic
missiles against the US while
we still can!

15
00:00:41,566 --> 00:00:44,066
Activate Triple Six
Delta protocal.

16
00:00:44,166 --> 00:00:46,633
It's the only way for you to
fulfill your duty.

17
00:00:46,733 --> 00:00:52,000
It's your constitutional
obligation to protect the
American people from
foreign threat!

18
00:00:56,333 --> 00:00:58,433
[assistant] Mr. Chairman!

19
00:01:02,066 --> 00:01:04,566
I'm not going to make it.

20
00:01:04,666 --> 00:01:07,533
Someone... just end it.

21
00:01:09,433 --> 00:01:11,200
Yes, sir!

22
00:01:12,333 --> 00:01:15,033
[chairman] Mr. President...

23
00:01:15,133 --> 00:01:17,800
The code...

24
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:19,600
[chairman] May God...

25
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:22,066
...bless the United States...

26
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,533
[bang]

27
00:03:13,966 --> 00:03:16,733
[singing]
Row, row, row your boat...

28
00:03:16,833 --> 00:03:19,266
gently down the stream...

29
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:22,133
merrily, merrily,
merrily, merrily...

30
00:03:22,233 --> 00:03:25,100
Life is but a dream.

31
00:03:25,633 --> 00:03:36,466
[continue singing]

32
00:03:38,033 --> 00:03:40,000
[Arisu]
Come on! Let's sing it again.

33
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:41,666
[Kota] Okay!

34
00:03:41,766 --> 00:03:47,400
[singing] Row, row, row your
boat, gently down the stream...

35
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:53,400
Merrily, merrily, merrily,
merrily, life is but a dream...

36
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,400
All right, now the filk version.

37
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,433
Okay!

38
00:03:57,533 --> 00:04:02,500
[Kota] Shoot, shoot, shoot your
gun, kill them all right now!

39
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:07,600
Bang, bang, bang, bang,
life is but a scream!

40
00:04:08,733 --> 00:04:10,600
[Arisu] That's great, Kota!

41
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:11,433
[thud]

42
00:04:11,533 --> 00:04:12,700
Hey, ya fat otaku!

43
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:15,233
Don't teach a little kid a
strange filk song like that!

44
00:04:15,333 --> 00:04:18,500
Got it?
Don't bastardize Mother Goose!

45
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,666
Okay...

46
00:04:20,766 --> 00:04:22,766
[Shizuka] Wake up, everyone.

47
00:04:22,866 --> 00:04:25,500
We'll get to
the other side soon.

48
00:04:43,866 --> 00:04:46,566
[Saya] That's weird.
There's no one...

49
00:04:46,666 --> 00:04:48,466
living or dead.

50
00:04:49,633 --> 00:04:50,500
[Takashi] Gah!

51
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,766
Hey!

52
00:04:51,866 --> 00:04:53,633
Ah! That hurt!

53
00:04:53,733 --> 00:04:55,266
Must be nice.

54
00:04:55,366 --> 00:04:57,666
What are you talking about‐

55
00:04:57,766 --> 00:04:59,100
[Takashi] What...?

56
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,900
Oh, Saeko, uh...

57
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,700
Good morning. You're drooling.

58
00:05:08,866 --> 00:05:10,500
Let's get out.

59
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,500
Why?

60
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,866
Well, the sun is up,

61
00:05:12,966 --> 00:05:17,600
so I figure maybe you should
get dressed.

62
00:05:20,966 --> 00:05:23,133
Hey, Komuro, give me a hand.

63
00:05:23,233 --> 00:05:25,333
I'll let Arisu down.

64
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:28,400
Don't look... Don't look.

65
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:33,333
My... My underwear...

66
00:05:34,133 --> 00:05:36,233
[Rei] Don't be so insensitive!

67
00:05:36,333 --> 00:05:41,166
We're going to get dressed too,
so don't you dare look!

68
00:05:41,266 --> 00:05:44,000
[Takashi] So you're saying that
girl is who?
[Rei] There you are.
Good as new.

69
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:47,166
[Kota] Don't you know
anything? Arisu Maresato...

70
00:05:47,266 --> 00:05:50,333
Her father is that
newspaper reporter.

71
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:52,766
He was a newspaper reporter...

72
00:05:52,866 --> 00:05:54,333
Where's her mother?

73
00:05:54,433 --> 00:05:57,266
She said that her father told
her that they'd see her later.

74
00:05:58,833 --> 00:06:00,166
[gasp]

75
00:06:01,733 --> 00:06:05,033
I brought my girl friend's
clothes, so pick the ones
you like.

76
00:06:05,133 --> 00:06:07,866
[Saya]
Hey, can I wear this jacket?

77
00:06:07,966 --> 00:06:09,166
[Shizuka] Sure!

78
00:06:09,266 --> 00:06:12,166
[Saeko] Is this the
only skirt you've got?

79
00:06:12,266 --> 00:06:13,600
[Shizuka] Pretty sexy, huh?

80
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:17,266
Well Komuro, a man's gotta
do what a man's gotta do!

81
00:06:17,366 --> 00:06:19,466
[Takashi] I told you I don't
want to die just yet!

82
00:06:19,566 --> 00:06:21,266
[bark]

83
00:06:21,366 --> 00:06:23,433
[Takashi] You're a spunky
little guy, aren't ya?

84
00:06:23,533 --> 00:06:25,933
[Kota]
But don't bark too much, Zero.

85
00:06:26,033 --> 00:06:27,333
Zero?

86
00:06:27,433 --> 00:06:29,666
[Kota] Yeah, like the plane.
You know, the Reisen.

87
00:06:29,766 --> 00:06:33,566
The one used when we got our
asses handed to us during
the Pacific War.

88
00:06:33,666 --> 00:06:34,866
[Takashi] Reisen?

89
00:06:34,966 --> 00:06:36,366
Oh, you mean, the Zero fighter?

90
00:06:36,466 --> 00:06:39,233
Oh yeah, small and fast
just like this little guy.

91
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:39,966
[bark]

92
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:41,800
Here, use this, Komuro.

93
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:43,866
It's a shotgun, so all you have
to do is aim around their heads.

94
00:06:43,966 --> 00:06:45,333
You'll hit 'em.

95
00:06:45,433 --> 00:06:47,233
[Takashi] But like I said I
don't know how to use it.

96
00:06:47,333 --> 00:06:49,900
A baseball bat is better for me.

97
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,500
[Kota] They're cartridges.

98
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,700
The shells are basically
a casing filled with
little pellets.

99
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:57,333
You only have to adjust the
sight, find your target,
then pull the trigger.

100
00:06:57,433 --> 00:06:59,366
You can blast their heads
of with this.

101
00:06:59,466 --> 00:07:02,533
Trust me, even a gun moron like
you can pull this off.

102
00:07:02,633 --> 00:07:04,966
[Takashi] What do I do when I
there're no more bullets left?

103
00:07:05,066 --> 00:07:06,933
When that happens,
open this gate,

104
00:07:07,033 --> 00:07:08,966
so you load more like this.

105
00:07:09,066 --> 00:07:13,100
It's really easy. You can only
load four bullets and have one
in the cartridge chamber,

106
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,566
so keep that in mind.

107
00:07:14,666 --> 00:07:16,566
There's another really cool
feature with this gun,

108
00:07:16,666 --> 00:07:18,200
one of my favorites‐

109
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:20,100
[Takashi] I get confused if you
tell me too many things at once.

110
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,433
[Kota] But I should warn you.

111
00:07:21,533 --> 00:07:24,200
The recoil is pretty powerful.
This baby bucks.

112
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:27,033
[Takashi] In a worst‐case
scenario, I'll use it as a club.

113
00:07:27,133 --> 00:07:29,366
You are so hopeless...

114
00:07:29,466 --> 00:07:31,200
I know.

115
00:07:33,733 --> 00:07:35,633
[Arisu] Takashi!

116
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:38,733
What do they wan‐

117
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:55,666
What? Got a problem?

118
00:07:55,766 --> 00:07:58,000
No, you look good with it,

119
00:07:58,100 --> 00:07:59,633
but can you shoot it?

120
00:07:59,733 --> 00:08:01,266
I'll ask Hirano to teach me.

121
00:08:01,366 --> 00:08:03,233
Worse comes to worst,
I'll just hit 'em with it.

122
00:08:03,333 --> 00:08:05,300
Oh I'd be delighted
to teach you!

123
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:08,066
Perhaps you've noticed the
standard issue bayonet?

124
00:08:08,166 --> 00:08:09,766
We're gonna bring up
the Hum‐Vee!

125
00:08:09,866 --> 00:08:12,600
And you two cover us!

126
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,733
[Kota] Yes, ma'am!

127
00:08:23,633 --> 00:08:25,266
[Kota] Clear!

128
00:08:25,366 --> 00:08:27,633
Okay!

129
00:08:27,733 --> 00:08:29,566
[Rei] Miss Shizuka!

130
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,066
Here we go!

131
00:08:36,866 --> 00:08:38,333
<i>Rat Patrol...</i>

132
00:08:43,966 --> 00:08:47,666
All these zombies and I'm
gonna get killed by an
Asian woman driver!

133
00:08:47,766 --> 00:08:51,766
[Saya] I guess the river
didn't stop Them, huh?

134
00:08:51,866 --> 00:08:55,433
I don't know why any of
us thought it would be any
different on the other side.

135
00:08:55,533 --> 00:08:58,666
But if the police are still on
the job, then maybe...

136
00:08:58,766 --> 00:09:03,033
Yeah, you're right. And maybe
curbside recycling is still
happening too.

137
00:09:03,133 --> 00:09:05,166
Yeah! Wait...

138
00:09:05,266 --> 00:09:06,966
But what are we going to do now?

139
00:09:07,066 --> 00:09:10,100
Your house is in the
second block of the
Higashisaka district.

140
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,133
[Saya] That's right.

141
00:09:11,233 --> 00:09:12,866
Then, that's the closest one.

142
00:09:12,966 --> 00:09:15,100
Looks like we go to your
house first.

143
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,033
But they... may, you know...

144
00:09:18,133 --> 00:09:20,266
[Saya] I know.

145
00:09:20,366 --> 00:09:23,800
I'm not expecting anything,
but still...

146
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:25,366
[Takashi] It'll be fine.

147
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,666
Look at all the motorcycles!

148
00:09:46,766 --> 00:09:49,933
They sell imported buggies
and stuff like that.

149
00:09:50,033 --> 00:09:52,600
Sometimes military
equipment too.

150
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:54,033
Really?

151
00:09:54,133 --> 00:09:56,733
[Saya] [mocking] "Sometimes
military equipment too."

152
00:09:57,933 --> 00:09:59,433
[Rei] What's the matter?

153
00:09:59,533 --> 00:10:01,466
I don't see any choppers
or planes.

154
00:10:01,566 --> 00:10:04,133
But there were a hell of a lot
of them yesterday.

155
00:10:05,366 --> 00:10:07,066
[Rei]
It's going to be okay, right?

156
00:10:07,166 --> 00:10:10,433
[Takashi] Uh... Yeah, probably.

157
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,666
[Rei] Look on the bright side.

158
00:10:15,533 --> 00:10:16,900
What bright side?

159
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,400
Haven't you noticed?

160
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:21,733
We haven't seen a single one
of Them since this morning.

161
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,333
You're right.

162
00:10:25,433 --> 00:10:30,200
[â™ª]

163
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,200
[Kota] It's Them!

164
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:05,600
Distance, 300 meters!

165
00:11:07,633 --> 00:11:08,700
Go to the right!

166
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,733
O..Okay!

167
00:11:12,366 --> 00:11:15,033
[Shizuka] They're here too!
Oh, no!

168
00:11:15,133 --> 00:11:17,733
Then, turn left there.
Turn left!

169
00:11:19,666 --> 00:11:20,900
[Takashi] What's going on?

170
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,400
The closer we get, the more of
Them there are.

171
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:27,066
But why? We haven't seen any of
them for miles!

172
00:11:28,433 --> 00:11:30,533
Just keep going! Don't stop!

173
00:11:34,433 --> 00:11:35,666
What...?

174
00:11:35,766 --> 00:11:37,366
Oh no... Oh no!

175
00:11:37,466 --> 00:11:40,400
[Rei] Stop the car!
Stop the car!

176
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,766
Jesus Christ! There's a wire!

177
00:11:43,866 --> 00:11:46,233
Turn the car to the side!
To the side!

178
00:11:50,433 --> 00:11:51,866
Don't look!

179
00:11:51,966 --> 00:11:54,000
[Shizuka] How come it
won't it stop?

180
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:55,400
The tires are locked!

181
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:58,800
Take off the break and press
the gas just a little!

182
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:01,333
Locked? What's that?!

183
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:07,366
[Takashi] Look out!

184
00:12:07,466 --> 00:12:08,600
Hang on!

185
00:12:22,533 --> 00:12:28,466
[wheezing]

186
00:12:52,533 --> 00:12:54,766
[Takashi]
Okay, pull the slide...

187
00:12:54,866 --> 00:12:56,833
Aim for the head...

188
00:12:56,933 --> 00:12:58,533
Takashi!

189
00:12:58,866 --> 00:13:01,033
Fire!

190
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:07,000
What the hell?
I aimed at the head!

191
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:08,266
[Takashi] I only killed one
of them?

192
00:13:08,366 --> 00:13:10,100
[Kota] You don't know what
you're doing!

193
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,633
Because of the recoil,
the muzzle moves off the target

194
00:13:12,733 --> 00:13:14,300
and the pattern shoots high.

195
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:16,600
[Kota] Shoulder the gun and
lean into it.

196
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:17,933
Aim around their chests!

197
00:13:18,033 --> 00:13:20,300
[Takashi] Shoulder the gun and
lean into it...

198
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,833
Aim around the chests and...

199
00:13:22,933 --> 00:13:24,766
Fire!

200
00:13:25,766 --> 00:13:28,200
Awesome!

201
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:30,833
Aw man, there're way too many.

202
00:13:30,933 --> 00:13:32,166
[Kota] After the shot,

203
00:13:32,266 --> 00:13:34,733
keep the aim on the target and
pull the slide.

204
00:13:34,833 --> 00:13:38,233
Shift the muzzle just
a tiny bit.

205
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,133
Cool! Fuckin' a!

206
00:13:45,766 --> 00:13:47,100
[click]

207
00:13:47,933 --> 00:13:49,900
[Takashi] Oh! Out of bullets.

208
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,133
Guh! Shit! Damn it!

209
00:13:52,233 --> 00:13:53,566
[Saeko] Komuro!

210
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:54,966
Go get her, I'll cover you.

211
00:13:55,066 --> 00:13:56,333
But you better move like you
got a fucking purpose!

212
00:13:56,433 --> 00:13:58,133
You can't!
There're way too many of them

213
00:13:58,233 --> 00:14:00,666
to fight with a wooden sword.

214
00:14:00,766 --> 00:14:03,066
Just get the girl.

215
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:15,700
[Takashi] Damn it!

216
00:14:21,066 --> 00:14:24,766
This is it. Had a good run.

217
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:29,666
[Rei] Takashi?

218
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,200
Oh, yeah! Sorry!

219
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:40,033
Huh?!

220
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:42,366
Hirano, what about this?

221
00:14:42,466 --> 00:14:45,733
[Kota] Flip the lever in
front of the trigger guard.

222
00:14:46,966 --> 00:14:48,533
You can disengage
the safety that way.

223
00:14:48,633 --> 00:14:50,566
After that,
pull the slide to the right.

224
00:14:50,666 --> 00:14:52,600
You're ready to shoot!

225
00:15:26,866 --> 00:15:28,733
Fuckin' missed!

226
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,533
Damn it! God damn it!

227
00:15:33,866 --> 00:15:35,933
The magazine is...

228
00:15:36,033 --> 00:15:38,566
[Kota] Somebody hand me a
knights meg magazine!

229
00:15:38,666 --> 00:15:39,733
Kota?

230
00:15:39,833 --> 00:15:40,733
Like this!

231
00:15:40,833 --> 00:15:43,000
Okay!

232
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:45,200
[barking]

233
00:15:46,766 --> 00:15:48,633
[Arisu] Kota!

234
00:15:48,733 --> 00:15:50,666
Here's some.

235
00:15:53,333 --> 00:15:55,333
[Kota] I'll kill Them...

236
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,466
I'll kill them all!

237
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:04,366
What the‐? I can't get the
stupid engine to turn over!

238
00:16:04,466 --> 00:16:07,033
Takagi?!
What do you think you're doing?

239
00:16:07,133 --> 00:16:09,733
[Saya] I'll pick up
Komuro's gun and use it!

240
00:16:09,833 --> 00:16:11,800
It's too dangerous!

241
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:13,766
We're about to find out.

242
00:16:13,866 --> 00:16:15,733
[Shizuka] Takagi!

243
00:16:17,333 --> 00:16:18,800
Shells are by your foot.

244
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:20,700
[Kota] Do you know how
to use it?

245
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,500
I'm a genius!

246
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:23,733
Takagi!

247
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:27,400
Relax, I know what I'm doing.

248
00:16:34,233 --> 00:16:37,700
Look at me!
This is Dolce & Gabanna!

249
00:16:39,466 --> 00:16:42,700
Take that you fashion
backward douchbags!

250
00:16:43,566 --> 00:16:45,500
Ruin my new outfit!

251
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,866
If you weren't already dead,
I'd kill you!

252
00:16:47,966 --> 00:16:51,166
You nasty, stinky walking
dead deadbeats!

253
00:16:51,733 --> 00:16:53,066
[bang]

254
00:17:29,033 --> 00:17:30,366
[bark]

255
00:17:32,766 --> 00:17:34,400
Zero!

256
00:17:53,933 --> 00:17:56,700
Hey! That's my gun!

257
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,633
I'll take over from here on out.

258
00:17:59,866 --> 00:18:01,633
What are you doing?

259
00:18:04,133 --> 00:18:06,333
Zero can't do it alone.

260
00:18:22,633 --> 00:18:25,600
Komuro, go!
I'll be right behind you!

261
00:18:31,033 --> 00:18:33,333
[Takashi] Don't stop!

262
00:18:34,033 --> 00:18:35,566
[Saeko] Come this way!

263
00:18:35,666 --> 00:18:37,000
[clang]

264
00:18:38,133 --> 00:18:40,200
[Saeko] Komuro, over there!

265
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:45,733
[Takashi] Come on! Hurry up!

266
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,333
Aw, shit.

267
00:18:57,066 --> 00:18:58,566
[Saeko] They keep coming.

268
00:18:59,733 --> 00:19:00,600
[Takashi] Damn it!

269
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:03,300
This way, motherfuckers!

270
00:19:07,933 --> 00:19:09,466
[Kota] Up you go...

271
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:11,333
Kota?

272
00:19:11,433 --> 00:19:14,400
You and Zero jump over the
fence to get to the other side.

273
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:16,400
[Arisu]
But what about everybody else?

274
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,200
[Kota]
We're coming right after you.

275
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:20,533
[Arisu] That's a lie!
[Kota] What?

276
00:19:20,633 --> 00:19:24,400
[Arisu] Daddy gave me the same
look that you just gave me when
he died.

277
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:27,500
He said it was okay,
but he still died!

278
00:19:28,366 --> 00:19:30,033
[Arisu] No way! No way!

279
00:19:30,133 --> 00:19:32,333
I don't want to be alone!

280
00:19:32,433 --> 00:19:36,533
I'm going to stay with you,
Takashi and the all the girls!

281
00:19:36,633 --> 00:19:39,633
[Arisu] I'm going to stay with
you guys forever!

282
00:19:39,733 --> 00:19:42,000
No! Don't let me be alone!

283
00:19:44,166 --> 00:19:47,033
Please! Please!

284
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,633
[Arisu] No, no, no!

285
00:21:23,733 --> 00:21:25,866
Don't let me be alone!

286
00:21:25,966 --> 00:21:27,066
Please!

287
00:21:27,166 --> 00:21:30,466
Please! Please!

288
00:21:31,966 --> 00:21:34,266
Kota!

289
00:21:34,366 --> 00:21:37,066
[Yuriko] Get the ladder!
Get them out of there now!

290
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:50,733
[Takashi] Look...

291
00:21:51,966 --> 00:21:53,566
Who's that?

292
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,733
[Yuriko] Come this way now.

293
00:21:56,833 --> 00:21:59,500
We'll get the car later.

294
00:22:02,866 --> 00:22:04,366
Who are these people?

295
00:22:04,466 --> 00:22:08,533
I don't think they're from the
fire department.

296
00:22:08,633 --> 00:22:12,700
[Shizuka] Thank you so much for
saving us from that situation.

297
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,733
[Yuriko] Of course.

298
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:22,500
She's my daughter. What was I
going to do? Leave her to die?

299
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:24,366
Mommy!

300
00:22:27,666 --> 00:22:29,833
[sobbing]

301
00:22:29,933 --> 00:22:32,200
[Takashi]
That's Takagi's mother?!

302
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:34,466
Fuckin' a! We're saved!

303
00:22:34,566 --> 00:22:39,433
Not quite. I have a hard time
believing more help is really
on the way.

304
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:42,166
Well then, we go to them.

305
00:22:42,266 --> 00:22:44,700
Come on. I know this area.

306
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:47,433
[Rei] T‐Takashi...

307
00:22:50,466 --> 00:22:52,133
Kota...

308
00:22:52,233 --> 00:22:53,500
[Kota] It's okay now.

309
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:56,000
And don't worry about
Komuro and Saeko.

310
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:58,066
They're going to be just fine.

311
00:23:01,033 --> 00:23:03,433
I'll be waiting!

312
00:23:03,533 --> 00:23:07,200
I'll be waiting!
Come to my house on the hill!

313
00:23:17,219 --> 00:23:18,315
[Takashi]
<i>I know it sounds strange,</i>

314
00:23:18,415 --> 00:23:21,515
<i>but even in the middle of</i>
<i>all that hell,</i>

315
00:23:21,615 --> 00:23:23,582
<i>I felt great.</i>

316
00:23:23,682 --> 00:23:25,415
<i>Empowered somehow.</i>

317
00:23:26,482 --> 00:23:28,415
<i>We seemed invincible.</i>
