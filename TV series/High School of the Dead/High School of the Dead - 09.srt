1
00:00:01,166 --> 00:00:04,266
[Yuriko] Get the ladder!
Get them out of there now!

2
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:13,833
[Takashi] Who are these people?

3
00:00:13,933 --> 00:00:16,500
[Saeko] I don't think they're
from the fire department.

4
00:00:18,333 --> 00:00:19,633
Mommy!

5
00:00:22,133 --> 00:00:24,100
[Takashi]
That's Takagi's mother?

6
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:26,333
Fuckin' a! We're saved!

7
00:00:26,433 --> 00:00:32,000
Not quite. I have a hard time
believe more help is really
on the way.

8
00:00:32,733 --> 00:00:33,900
Well then, we go to them.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,366
Come on. I know this area.

10
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:43,733
I'll be waiting!
Come to my house on the hill!

11
00:02:28,866 --> 00:02:30,266
Damn it, this place too?

12
00:02:30,366 --> 00:02:32,866
It doesn't look like we can
make it to the second block.

13
00:02:32,966 --> 00:02:34,333
[Takashi]
Let's go back the way we came.

14
00:02:34,433 --> 00:02:37,333
We didn't run into any of Them
on the way here.

15
00:02:46,133 --> 00:02:48,066
[Takashi] I can see
Takagi's house from here.

16
00:02:48,166 --> 00:02:49,900
[Saeko] Are you ready to walk
on the fence again?

17
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,500
[Takashi] No way.

18
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:56,600
Man, if I only had a bike...

19
00:02:59,166 --> 00:03:01,033
Check it out!

20
00:03:06,466 --> 00:03:08,366
[Takashi] I'll pick our ride.

21
00:03:08,466 --> 00:03:10,500
You get what you think we need.

22
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:15,633
[Saeko] That's fine,
but tandem is dangerous.

23
00:03:15,733 --> 00:03:17,733
This isn't a date, right?

24
00:03:19,733 --> 00:03:21,433
[nervous laughter]

25
00:03:28,133 --> 00:03:30,333
[Saeko] How about this?

26
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:36,733
[Takashi] Oh hell yeah!
That's what I'm talkin' about.

27
00:03:39,766 --> 00:03:42,766
Did I ever tell you how much
I like your taste?

28
00:03:48,433 --> 00:03:50,300
Things are about to
get interesting.

29
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,800
Yeah, you got that right.

30
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,833
I don't suppose you have a plan?

31
00:03:54,933 --> 00:03:56,600
Feel like sharing it with me?

32
00:03:56,966 --> 00:03:58,633
I do!

33
00:03:58,733 --> 00:03:59,733
But...

34
00:03:59,833 --> 00:04:00,933
You do but what?

35
00:04:01,033 --> 00:04:03,666
It might get a little
too interesting.

36
00:04:05,533 --> 00:04:06,300
Don't worry...

37
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,766
What you give me, I can handle.

38
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:11,600
[Takashi] Hold on tight!

39
00:04:25,566 --> 00:04:28,800
They can use the stairs but
can't walk on a slope?

40
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:31,033
Appears so.

41
00:04:31,133 --> 00:04:33,300
[Saeko]
But their recovery is flawless.

42
00:04:36,966 --> 00:04:39,000
It's not going to matter at all.

43
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:41,233
Really?
And what makes you think that?

44
00:04:41,333 --> 00:04:43,600
[Takashi]
Cuz if that's the case...

45
00:04:44,466 --> 00:04:46,700
What the hell?
What are you doing?

46
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,066
This thing's amphibious!

47
00:04:49,166 --> 00:04:51,100
Amphibious?

48
00:04:56,866 --> 00:04:59,300
Oh shit! Sorry Saeko! You okay?

49
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,466
[Takashi] Uh, oh Go...

50
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,966
Geez! You don't have to stare!

51
00:05:16,066 --> 00:05:18,733
[Takashi] Uh... I know!
I‐I'm sorry!

52
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:49,600
Oh come on now, don't tell me
that took it all out of you.

53
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:50,966
W‐What do you mean?!

54
00:05:51,066 --> 00:05:52,533
N‐No! I swear I'm good to go!

55
00:05:52,633 --> 00:05:56,066
Maybe you should use your
bedroom voice.

56
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:06,766
[Saeko] It was a clever idea
to use the sandbar.

57
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:08,233
[Takashi]
You know, when I was a kid,

58
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:11,566
I was told over and over
again never to play here

59
00:06:11,666 --> 00:06:16,000
because the water is too deep
and the current was too strong.

60
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:20,066
Well, whether it worked out
as you planned or not,

61
00:06:20,166 --> 00:06:21,566
it's nice to have a break.

62
00:06:21,666 --> 00:06:24,600
[Takashi] Yeah, let's take turns
and watch out for Them.

63
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:26,966
I'll watch first. You go ahead
and take a break, Saeko.

64
00:06:27,066 --> 00:06:28,566
[sneeze]

65
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,766
Ex‐Excuse me.
I'm freezing my ass off here.

66
00:06:35,033 --> 00:06:37,133
Yeah, sorry about that.

67
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:41,733
[Takashi]
Here, wear this for now.

68
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,333
Thank you.

69
00:07:12,533 --> 00:07:14,466
[Saeko] I'm done.

70
00:07:19,266 --> 00:07:21,166
What's wrong? Don't you like it?

71
00:07:21,266 --> 00:07:25,700
No! Not at all, just the
opposite actually...

72
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:29,900
God you're such a sucker.
Can't you tell when I'm
just fucking with you?

73
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,466
You're what?!
Oh yeah, I'm sorry.

74
00:07:32,566 --> 00:07:33,333
Sorry...

75
00:07:33,433 --> 00:07:36,066
[Saeko] No reason to apologize.

76
00:07:43,033 --> 00:07:45,433
[Takashi] Uh... Hey.

77
00:07:45,533 --> 00:07:49,766
Let me ask you, have you ever
had a boyfriend or something?

78
00:07:50,933 --> 00:07:52,300
[Saeko] Excuse me?

79
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,600
[Takashi] Uh, I'm just trying
to make conversation...

80
00:07:56,066 --> 00:07:57,466
I mean...

81
00:07:57,566 --> 00:08:00,666
Someone like you maybe...
crush at least?

82
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:05,633
Of course I have...

83
00:08:06,733 --> 00:08:09,400
I almost thought it was love.

84
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,133
[Saeko] I guess it's okay now.

85
00:08:17,233 --> 00:08:18,933
Looks like most of
Them are gone.

86
00:08:19,033 --> 00:08:21,233
[Takashi] Oh, yeah.

87
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:38,300
Now I see more.

88
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:41,066
Seems like you and I get more
popular by the minute.

89
00:08:41,166 --> 00:08:44,233
We'll find out after turning
the next corner.

90
00:08:48,033 --> 00:08:49,200
A park?

91
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:52,500
Oh come on, don't you like
merry‐go‐rounds?

92
00:09:06,333 --> 00:09:10,166
Jesus Christ! Do you
actually enjoy getting
me wet or something?!

93
00:09:10,266 --> 00:09:12,766
Just give me the tape
from the backpack.

94
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,066
[Saeko] Huh. Not too bad...

95
00:09:29,166 --> 00:09:31,833
Lure Them with the noise
and then...

96
00:09:31,933 --> 00:09:33,433
Very nice.

97
00:09:33,533 --> 00:09:34,933
[Takashi] If we go through
the east exit,

98
00:09:35,033 --> 00:09:37,500
it'll put us right behind
Takagi's house.

99
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:41,500
I'd rather not use the gun
because the sound echoes,
but you never know...

100
00:09:44,866 --> 00:09:46,733
All right then...

101
00:09:50,466 --> 00:09:52,533
We'll do this!

102
00:09:58,066 --> 00:09:59,566
Hold it.

103
00:10:02,766 --> 00:10:04,233
God you reek.

104
00:10:04,333 --> 00:10:07,666
I know you're dead, but is a
little hygiene too much to ask?

105
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:17,900
Now then...

106
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,033
That's enough holding back!

107
00:10:25,133 --> 00:10:27,666
Holy shit, she's a maniac.

108
00:10:43,066 --> 00:10:45,133
What are you doing?
Why'd you stop?

109
00:10:48,466 --> 00:10:51,266
Saeko!
What the hell's going on?

110
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:02,666
Come on!

111
00:11:02,766 --> 00:11:04,433
[Takashi] Hurry up!

112
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Saeko, tell me
what happened back there.

113
00:11:38,233 --> 00:11:40,933
It's too dangerous for us
to be out at night.

114
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:43,133
We wait here until morning.

115
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:00,200
[Takashi] Whoa, this is real.

116
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,200
Saeko, look at this...

117
00:12:07,233 --> 00:12:09,133
[Takashi]
Come here and have a seat.

118
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Your uniform is dry too.

119
00:12:44,633 --> 00:12:46,633
I'm done.

120
00:12:51,833 --> 00:12:53,666
What a relief.

121
00:12:53,766 --> 00:12:56,100
Look what I found, Saeko.

122
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:58,866
What do you mean? Found what?

123
00:12:58,966 --> 00:13:00,500
[Takashi] Wanna know what?

124
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:03,000
Here it is.

125
00:13:08,566 --> 00:13:12,466
It's some kind of porta‐potty.
You can have it.

126
00:13:19,866 --> 00:13:21,333
Why are you laughing at me?

127
00:13:21,433 --> 00:13:24,600
I'd figured you'd find it
quite handy, so...

128
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:26,366
[Saeko] No, you're right.

129
00:13:28,466 --> 00:13:29,766
Thank you...

130
00:13:29,866 --> 00:13:31,733
Thanks a lot.

131
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:43,466
[Saeko]
So, you're not going to ask?

132
00:13:43,566 --> 00:13:45,233
[Takashi]
For you to act that way...

133
00:13:45,333 --> 00:13:47,633
I guess it was something
very serious.

134
00:14:00,366 --> 00:14:03,833
If you don't mind, I just
want to talk about it...

135
00:14:03,933 --> 00:14:06,100
You brought it up after all.

136
00:14:16,233 --> 00:14:18,266
[Saeko]
I started thinking about it...

137
00:14:18,866 --> 00:14:20,533
the fear.

138
00:14:21,666 --> 00:14:25,066
Because you saw the little kids?
Is that it?

139
00:14:25,166 --> 00:14:29,500
To tell you the truth, it wasn't
about them at all.

140
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:34,766
Remember you asked me, at the
sandbar, if I've ever had a
crush on someone?

141
00:14:34,866 --> 00:14:37,533
Oh yeah, about that‐ I'm sorry.

142
00:14:37,633 --> 00:14:39,200
[Saeko] It's okay.

143
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:40,900
I mean, hasn't everyone?

144
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,066
Can't get this far without
having a crush...

145
00:14:45,033 --> 00:14:47,333
on someone...

146
00:14:47,433 --> 00:14:49,466
[Saeko]
I've never told them how I felt.

147
00:14:49,566 --> 00:14:52,300
I just don't think I have
the right to.

148
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:55,266
[Takashi] But I think you can
get anyone you want.

149
00:14:55,366 --> 00:14:58,433
[Saeko] Even though I almost
killed someone?

150
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:05,966
[Saeko] Four years ago,

151
00:15:06,066 --> 00:15:08,666
I was attacked on the street
at night.

152
00:15:08,766 --> 00:15:10,933
I had a practice sword with me.

153
00:15:11,033 --> 00:15:14,566
I started hitting him and once
I started...

154
00:15:14,666 --> 00:15:16,633
I didn't stop.

155
00:15:16,733 --> 00:15:18,566
I‐I couldn't stop.

156
00:15:18,666 --> 00:15:21,833
It was... he was...

157
00:15:21,933 --> 00:15:24,266
After I told the police
what happened,

158
00:15:24,366 --> 00:15:26,600
they gave me a ride home
in the police car.

159
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:29,466
[Takashi]
But it was just self‐defense...

160
00:15:29,566 --> 00:15:33,500
[Saeko] It might've started out
that way, but to be honest...

161
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,066
I enjoyed it...

162
00:15:38,333 --> 00:15:42,533
Just letting the rage out
against someone?

163
00:15:42,633 --> 00:15:45,333
That was nothing but joy.

164
00:15:51,733 --> 00:15:54,966
[Saeko] When I realized
I had the upper hand,

165
00:15:55,066 --> 00:15:59,366
I felt so calm and
I pretended I was terrified.

166
00:16:00,133 --> 00:16:02,466
And then when I had him...

167
00:16:02,566 --> 00:16:03,733
I fought back.

168
00:16:06,233 --> 00:16:09,200
I fought him until there was
nothing but blood and bones.

169
00:16:11,333 --> 00:16:16,300
It was bliss.
Absolute, total pleasure.

170
00:16:17,033 --> 00:16:19,900
That's me! Me!

171
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,733
That's who I am! Can't you see?

172
00:16:22,833 --> 00:16:27,400
[Saeko]
The feeling of power, of control
over someone else's life.

173
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:28,800
I loved it!

174
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:31,700
Does anyone like that
deserve love?

175
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:35,600
But ever since this has
happened, I've felt
that way too!

176
00:16:39,333 --> 00:16:42,100
You became that way after
this happened...

177
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:44,600
But I was like that before.

178
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:46,800
Don't say that.

179
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:51,400
Nothing about me has changed.
I realized that in front of
the fountain.

180
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:54,600
[Saeko] Almost feels like
it's gotten worse.

181
00:17:49,166 --> 00:17:50,833
We'll get to the street
from the back.

182
00:17:50,933 --> 00:17:55,200
We should be able to get to
Takagi's house in twenty
minutes by foot.

183
00:17:58,266 --> 00:18:00,600
[Takashi] Why are they here?

184
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:02,366
We didn't make any noise.

185
00:18:02,466 --> 00:18:04,833
God damn it.

186
00:18:04,933 --> 00:18:06,400
I don't understand.

187
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:09,733
Saeko, I say we make
a run for it!

188
00:18:15,666 --> 00:18:17,500
[Takashi] Saeko!

189
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:26,033
I can't do it.

190
00:18:28,433 --> 00:18:30,000
Stop...

191
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:31,500
Wh‐What are you doing?

192
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:34,400
Don't even think for a minute
you're quitting on me now!

193
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:35,600
You got it?

194
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:38,366
We've come too far. There's no
way we're giving up!

195
00:18:38,466 --> 00:18:43,133
To die like this, have these
dead motherfuckers take us
down here?!

196
00:18:43,233 --> 00:18:46,733
[Takashi] It's not going to
happen! You're coming with me!

197
00:18:46,833 --> 00:18:48,766
Because whether you like
it or not,

198
00:18:48,866 --> 00:18:50,566
I need you!

199
00:18:50,666 --> 00:18:53,800
Maybe that son of a bitch
deserved to die, who knows?

200
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:55,733
I don't give a shit what
you did before!

201
00:18:55,833 --> 00:18:58,666
I just care about what
you do now!

202
00:19:13,266 --> 00:19:16,066
Thank you, I'm okay now.

203
00:19:22,333 --> 00:19:25,333
What are you waiting for?
Let's go.

204
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:55,633
<i>This is it!</i>

205
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:00,333
<i>This is it!</i>

206
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,733
<i>This is me!</i>

207
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,566
Saeko!

208
00:20:24,933 --> 00:20:26,633
<i>Yes!</i>

209
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:38,566
[Takashi] Saeko, this way!

210
00:20:42,166 --> 00:20:44,200
W‐What a minute.

211
00:20:48,966 --> 00:20:51,700
You meant what you
said, right?

212
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:01,200
[Takashi] Hells yeah!

213
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,400
[Arisu] Why are we in the back?

214
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:41,066
I have a feling they'd
come through the back

215
00:22:41,166 --> 00:22:43,200
if they wanted to sneak in.

216
00:22:43,966 --> 00:22:46,233
[barking]

217
00:22:46,333 --> 00:22:48,133
Zero?

218
00:22:50,466 --> 00:22:52,333
It's Takashi!

219
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,066
[Saya] Open the gate.

220
00:23:06,166 --> 00:23:07,300
[servant] Yes, ma'am!

221
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:08,500
[barking]

222
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:11,500
[Arisu] You're back!
You're both back!

223
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:17,000
[Takashi] <i>I accepted it.</i>

224
00:23:17,833 --> 00:23:19,566
<i>I accepted her darkness.</i>

225
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,166
<i>Why wouldn't I?</i>

226
00:23:22,266 --> 00:23:25,600
<i>I mean, I needed her</i>
<i>to be that way.</i>

227
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:30,033
<i>The darker she was, the more</i>
<i>chance I had to survive.</i>
