00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,366
<i>I stayed up late on the night</i>
<i>before the day everything came</i>
<i>to an end.</i>

2
00:00:24,066 --> 00:00:27,633
[hurried footsteps]

3
00:00:36,733 --> 00:00:38,100
[Takasi] Hurry!

4
00:00:44,066 --> 00:00:46,633
[Takashi] Hisashi,
are you okay?

5
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:53,566
Are you nuts?!

6
00:00:53,666 --> 00:00:55,066
Say what?!

7
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:10,233
Get away!

8
00:01:10,333 --> 00:01:10,766
Re‐

9
00:01:10,866 --> 00:01:12,600
Rei!

10
00:01:21,433 --> 00:01:22,766
Hisashi!

11
00:01:22,866 --> 00:01:24,866
[Hisashi] Did you see that?

12
00:01:24,966 --> 00:01:27,466
We need to smash their heads
to kill them.

13
00:01:32,466 --> 00:01:33,933
Rei! Hisashi!

14
00:01:34,033 --> 00:01:35,733
[Takasi] Hurry, this way!

15
00:01:35,833 --> 00:01:36,733
[Hisashi] Okay!

16
00:01:42,566 --> 00:01:44,033
Damnit...

17
00:01:44,133 --> 00:01:45,666
[Takashi] What the fuck?

18
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:57,600
What the fuck's going on?!

19
00:03:47,233 --> 00:03:50,300
[Rei] <i>You know we're going to</i>
<i>get married one day!</i>

20
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,833
[Takashi] Really? Do you
really mean it?

21
00:03:52,933 --> 00:03:56,633
Yeah! Pinky promise!
Cross my heart!

22
00:03:56,733 --> 00:03:58,333
[Takashi] And hope to die.

23
00:03:59,233 --> 00:04:01,166
Why do you have to repeat
the grade?

24
00:04:01,266 --> 00:04:03,200
You're a straight‐A student.

25
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:07,033
[Rei] You wouldn't understand,
Takashi.

26
00:04:07,133 --> 00:04:10,466
[Hisashi] We're in the same
class again? Cool.

27
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:21,500
[Takashi] Pinky promise...

28
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:26,200
Cross my heart, and hope
to die... Yeah, right.

29
00:04:27,033 --> 00:04:29,266
[Saya] That's so stupid.

30
00:04:29,366 --> 00:04:30,733
[Takashi] What do you want?

31
00:04:30,833 --> 00:04:32,433
Every time you have to face
something you don't like,

32
00:04:32,533 --> 00:04:35,366
you always come to this
stupid staircase.

33
00:04:35,466 --> 00:04:38,733
It's like your own little pity
corner, look at you. Good God.

34
00:04:38,833 --> 00:04:43,300
The first semester has just
started. How are you ever going
to make it through the year?

35
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,066
I could say the same thing
to you.

36
00:04:45,166 --> 00:04:46,600
[Takashi] The fifth period isn't
even over yet.

37
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:49,900
[Saya] It's okay because
I'm genius, unlike you,

38
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,133
who got into this school
by dumb luck.

39
00:04:52,233 --> 00:04:55,366
[Takashi] Takagi, why do you
always dis me like that?

40
00:04:55,466 --> 00:04:57,866
Because I don't like
stupid people.

41
00:04:57,966 --> 00:05:01,433
Especially thosee ones who can't
admit that they're stupid.

42
00:05:01,533 --> 00:05:04,066
I mean, you're pretty stupid,
but at least you know you are.

43
00:05:04,166 --> 00:05:09,600
So, if I tell you that you're
stupid, maybe by some miracle,
you'll be less stupid, stupid.

44
00:05:13,733 --> 00:05:17,833
Grow up. Moping because your
little friend dumped you?

45
00:05:17,933 --> 00:05:19,566
Stupid.

46
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:23,200
[Rei] Listen, it's just that...

47
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:26,900
There was a time that I
really felt that way,

48
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,600
but you didn't seem to
notice, so...

49
00:05:36,166 --> 00:05:38,266
[Takashi] So... What?

50
00:05:40,066 --> 00:05:44,533
[clang, clang, clang]

51
00:05:44,633 --> 00:05:47,133
Who's that? A tresspasser?

52
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,866
You there. What do you think
you're doing?

53
00:05:54,966 --> 00:05:57,266
[Hayashi] This is a
private school.

54
00:05:57,366 --> 00:05:58,900
[Tejima] It's okay,
Miss Hayashi.

55
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,600
Let me handle it.

56
00:06:03,866 --> 00:06:05,800
Hey now! Mr. Tejima!

57
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:07,700
[Hayashi] Excessive
violence is...

58
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:12,233
[Tejima] Aah!

59
00:06:27,933 --> 00:06:29,933
Oh my gosh. He's dead.

60
00:06:30,033 --> 00:06:31,100
[Hayashi] No way...

61
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:34,200
That's impossible.
He was just...

62
00:06:37,266 --> 00:06:39,766
Mr. Tejima, are you all right?

63
00:06:40,866 --> 00:06:42,633
Oh Mr. Tejima, thank God...

64
00:06:42,733 --> 00:06:45,233
You had me worried there for a‐

65
00:06:45,333 --> 00:06:46,466
[scream]

66
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:06,600
[teacher] Komuro! You couldn't
be happy with just skipping
my class?

67
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:09,266
Come with me, we're gonna
get out of here.

68
00:07:09,366 --> 00:07:11,266
Wh..What are you talking about?

69
00:07:11,366 --> 00:07:13,000
Dude, what are you doing?

70
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:15,033
People just got killed
by the front gate.

71
00:07:15,133 --> 00:07:16,766
No bullshit.

72
00:07:16,866 --> 00:07:18,200
Are you serious?

73
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:21,566
[Takashi] Yeah, I'm making shit
like that up.

74
00:07:21,666 --> 00:07:23,000
Jesus, what's going on?!

75
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:25,300
I can never understand
what's go‐

76
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:29,633
[Rei] What the‐?!
[Takashi] Listen! Listen to me!

77
00:07:34,233 --> 00:07:36,600
[Rei] Just tell me what's
going on!

78
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:38,400
[Takashi] There was someone
at the school gate.

79
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:41,133
P.E. teachers went to check
it out and something happened.

80
00:07:41,233 --> 00:07:43,633
And now those P.E. teachers
are killing each other.

81
00:07:43,733 --> 00:07:45,733
[Rei] That's insane...

82
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:49,033
[Takashi] What?
You forgot something?

83
00:07:49,133 --> 00:07:52,033
[Hisashi] If what you told me
is true, we'll need some
weapons, right?

84
00:07:52,133 --> 00:07:53,633
Here, Rei.

85
00:07:53,733 --> 00:07:55,133
[Takashi] What about you?

86
00:07:55,233 --> 00:07:57,400
[Hisashi] I've got a black
belt in karate.

87
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:00,266
[Takashi] Come on, we've
gotta get out of the school.

88
00:08:00,366 --> 00:08:01,500
[Rei] Let's call the police.

89
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,000
We'll talk to my father.

90
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:06,033
[Hisashi] School rules are there
to be broken, right?

91
00:08:06,966 --> 00:08:14,966
[dialing and ringtone]

92
00:08:15,066 --> 00:08:17,533
[Rei] No way...
[Takashi] What is it?

93
00:08:17,633 --> 00:08:20,533
[automated voice] You may stay
on the line or call back
again later.

94
00:08:20,633 --> 00:08:24,733
Currently, 110 is experiencing
an extremely high call volume.

95
00:08:24,833 --> 00:08:27,133
You may stay on the line or
call back again later.

96
00:08:27,233 --> 00:08:31,500
[Rei] 110 is busy.
That's impossible...

97
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:35,366
[speaker crackling]
This announcement is for all
the students.

98
00:08:35,466 --> 00:08:38,500
An emergency situation is taking
place inside the school
right now!

99
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:43,900
All students must follow
your teacher's instructions
and evacuate.

100
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,466
[speaker] I repeat‐
[Hisashi] So, they finally
realized it?

101
00:08:47,566 --> 00:08:49,500
[speaker crackling]

102
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,633
It's happening...

103
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,300
[speaker] [grunt] Get away from
me! Get back!

104
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,366
[Saya] Hirano!

105
00:09:05,466 --> 00:09:06,766
Hey Takagi...

106
00:09:06,866 --> 00:09:08,600
Ssh! We gotta go!

107
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,000
[speaker] [screaming]

108
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:13,533
Help! Help!

109
00:09:17,633 --> 00:09:18,600
Huh?!

110
00:09:33,333 --> 00:09:41,131
[panic]

111
00:09:49,381 --> 00:09:50,877
[Hisashi] This way!
[Takashi] Where're you going?

112
00:09:50,877 --> 00:09:52,244
We gotta get out of here!

113
00:09:52,741 --> 00:09:54,541
[Hisashi] The building with
classrooms is too crowded.

114
00:09:54,641 --> 00:09:56,407
We need to go through the
management building!

115
00:09:56,507 --> 00:09:59,941
Hisashi is right. Shut up and
do what he says!

116
00:10:00,041 --> 00:10:01,774
Alright, fine!

117
00:10:07,274 --> 00:10:10,107
That's Mr. Wakisaka.
What's the matter with him?

118
00:10:30,174 --> 00:10:31,374
[Rei] Get away from me!

119
00:10:31,474 --> 00:10:33,174
Rei! Stab him!

120
00:10:33,274 --> 00:10:36,174
[Hisashi] Don't hold back;
give it all you've got!

121
00:10:36,707 --> 00:10:38,074
[Rei] Ah!

122
00:10:44,841 --> 00:10:45,974
Don't fuck with me!

123
00:10:46,074 --> 00:10:48,774
I'm V. P. of the martial
arts club!

124
00:10:56,507 --> 00:10:58,241
Yes!

125
00:11:09,907 --> 00:11:11,241
[Rei] That's insane!

126
00:11:11,341 --> 00:11:15,207
I stabbed him in his heart!
Why is he still moving?!

127
00:11:17,307 --> 00:11:18,974
[Hisashi] Rei, pull it out now!

128
00:11:19,074 --> 00:11:21,107
Hisashi, get away from him!

129
00:11:21,207 --> 00:11:24,441
Don't worry, I can take him.

130
00:11:29,707 --> 00:11:31,107
What the fuck?

131
00:11:33,374 --> 00:11:36,741
Hey, you, get the hell
away from him!

132
00:11:36,841 --> 00:11:38,341
[Rei] Hisashi!

133
00:11:40,641 --> 00:11:43,907
Jesus Christ! Why won't he just
die already?!

134
00:11:44,007 --> 00:11:45,707
Oh no, I knew it...

135
00:11:45,807 --> 00:11:47,341
He is dead.

136
00:11:47,441 --> 00:11:49,407
[Takashi] He's dead,
but still moving!

137
00:11:49,507 --> 00:11:51,374
[Rei] What?

138
00:11:53,807 --> 00:11:55,474
Hisashi!

139
00:11:57,607 --> 00:11:59,307
Takashi, help him!

140
00:11:59,407 --> 00:12:01,874
[Rei] Don't just stand there!
Do something!

141
00:12:01,974 --> 00:12:04,141
Do something, will ya?!

142
00:12:18,241 --> 00:12:20,941
[Rei] Hisashi, are you okay?

143
00:12:21,041 --> 00:12:22,841
Son of a bitch just bit me.

144
00:12:22,941 --> 00:12:23,807
No big deal.

145
00:12:23,907 --> 00:12:26,841
[crash]
[scream]

146
00:12:26,941 --> 00:12:29,307
Stop it! Stop it!

147
00:12:30,374 --> 00:12:33,407
We could handle one of 'em
but there's no way...

148
00:12:33,507 --> 00:12:35,074
The roof.

149
00:12:35,174 --> 00:12:38,307
[Rei] The roof?
[Hisashi] We should barricade
ourselves until help arrives.

150
00:12:38,407 --> 00:12:39,807
And we can see what's
going down.

151
00:12:39,907 --> 00:12:41,241
[door opening]

152
00:12:46,107 --> 00:12:48,041
[honking and sirens]

153
00:12:48,141 --> 00:12:49,474
[explosions]

154
00:12:58,507 --> 00:13:01,274
Holy shit.
It's happening everywhere.

155
00:13:01,374 --> 00:13:05,207
But everything was normal‐
Everything was fine a
minute ago!

156
00:13:18,941 --> 00:13:21,341
[Takashi] Black hawk?
American military?

157
00:13:21,441 --> 00:13:23,574
[Hisashi] That's not it.
That's Self‐Defense Force!

158
00:13:23,674 --> 00:13:25,774
Where did they come from?
There's no base around here.

159
00:13:25,874 --> 00:13:27,174
Over here!

160
00:13:27,274 --> 00:13:28,874
[Hisashi] Don't bother.

161
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:33,107
I wouldn't even waste your
strength. That's the
Self‐Defense Force.

162
00:13:33,207 --> 00:13:36,641
[Hisashi] They must have some
kind of special mission.

163
00:13:36,741 --> 00:13:38,407
They're not here to rescue us.

164
00:13:38,507 --> 00:13:41,674
They're not even doing
anything about that.

165
00:13:41,774 --> 00:13:45,107
That's what's going on outside
where you can still run away
from it.

166
00:13:46,507 --> 00:13:47,641
[scream]

167
00:13:47,741 --> 00:13:50,707
[Hisashi] Imagine what's going
on inside the school.

168
00:13:50,807 --> 00:13:53,607
[Toshimi] We should be okay if
we run together, Misuzu.

169
00:13:53,707 --> 00:13:57,641
Of course I will! Because you
and I are BFFs, Toshimi!

170
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:05,107
Ah! Ow, ow, ow, Misuzu!

171
00:14:07,007 --> 00:14:08,174
[Misuzu] Let go of me!

172
00:14:08,274 --> 00:14:10,541
Damnit bitch, I said let go!

173
00:14:21,774 --> 00:14:23,507
It's here too!

174
00:14:26,007 --> 00:14:28,841
There's no way this is
really happening.

175
00:14:28,941 --> 00:14:30,907
Dream, that's right!

176
00:14:31,007 --> 00:14:33,574
It's just a bad dream!

177
00:14:33,674 --> 00:14:36,707
[student] I need to wake up.
Go back to school.

178
00:14:36,807 --> 00:14:41,207
I'm supposed to chew all
of those new club members
out today.

179
00:14:47,874 --> 00:14:51,141
[Hisashi] This is like a disease
caused by "Them".

180
00:14:51,241 --> 00:14:52,607
[Takashi] "Them"?

181
00:14:52,707 --> 00:14:55,107
[Hisashi] The dead are attacking
people left and right,

182
00:14:55,207 --> 00:14:57,707
but this isn't a movie or
video game.

183
00:14:57,807 --> 00:14:59,441
That's why it's "Them".

184
00:14:59,541 --> 00:15:01,074
They bite people.

185
00:15:01,174 --> 00:15:04,207
And then they come back to
life as one of "Them".

186
00:15:04,307 --> 00:15:10,507
And it looks like smashing
their heads in is the only
way to get rid of them.

187
00:15:11,174 --> 00:15:14,041
There're too many of them.

188
00:15:14,141 --> 00:15:16,774
[Hisashi] Let's get up there
and block the stairs.

189
00:15:19,174 --> 00:15:21,374
[Takashi] Let's go!

190
00:15:30,807 --> 00:15:31,674
Rei!

191
00:15:31,774 --> 00:15:33,141
Get away!

192
00:15:44,474 --> 00:15:47,541
[Rei] Why?
Why is this happening?

193
00:15:48,407 --> 00:15:50,274
[Hisashi] There has to be
a reason.

194
00:15:50,374 --> 00:15:54,674
Maybe if we can figure out
what's causing it, we can
stop it.

195
00:15:54,774 --> 00:15:57,441
Or at least protect ourselves.

196
00:16:00,807 --> 00:16:04,607
We need to look around.
Find matches or a lighter
around here somewhere.

197
00:16:04,707 --> 00:16:08,741
If we don't make a fire now,
we're going to be fucked when
it gets dark.

198
00:16:10,774 --> 00:16:13,474
[vomitting]

199
00:16:15,807 --> 00:16:18,607
Hisashi, what's wrong with you?

200
00:16:18,707 --> 00:16:20,641
Takashi, Hisashi is...

201
00:16:37,174 --> 00:16:38,707
[Rei] Why? Why?

202
00:16:38,807 --> 00:16:42,907
He got bit just a little, so
why does it look so horrible?

203
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:46,174
[Takashi] So it is just
like the movies.

204
00:16:46,274 --> 00:16:48,607
They bite you and that's it.

205
00:16:48,707 --> 00:16:49,907
This can't be true!

206
00:16:50,007 --> 00:16:51,707
What you see in the movies
will never happen.

207
00:16:51,807 --> 00:16:54,607
[Takashi] But it did happen
to everyone else.

208
00:17:00,907 --> 00:17:05,074
[Hisashi] Takashi, will you
help me?

209
00:17:05,174 --> 00:17:07,307
Help you with what?

210
00:17:10,507 --> 00:17:15,941
[Hisashi] Help me over the
rail, straight to the ground
from here.

211
00:17:16,041 --> 00:17:19,374
The impact from the fall should
smash my head.

212
00:17:25,807 --> 00:17:26,774
What are you saying?!

213
00:17:26,874 --> 00:17:29,241
I don't want to be one of Them!

214
00:17:30,774 --> 00:17:32,641
Hisashi!

215
00:17:44,307 --> 00:17:48,374
[Hisashi] Come on, Takashi,
do it for me.

216
00:17:48,474 --> 00:17:52,707
I want to stay myself until
the end.

217
00:17:58,241 --> 00:18:01,207
[Rei] Hisashi, let me help you!

218
00:18:02,841 --> 00:18:05,707
No! No, Hisashi!

219
00:18:05,807 --> 00:18:07,807
You can't die!

220
00:18:07,907 --> 00:18:09,241
[screams]

221
00:18:29,774 --> 00:18:35,141
[sobbing]

222
00:18:46,074 --> 00:18:48,374
Get away from him, Rei.

223
00:18:51,974 --> 00:18:52,907
No!

224
00:18:53,007 --> 00:18:54,874
[Rei] You can't do that!

225
00:18:54,974 --> 00:18:56,407
He's not turning...

226
00:18:56,507 --> 00:19:00,641
He's not turning into one of
Them! He's going to be fine!

227
00:19:01,207 --> 00:19:03,407
Get away from him.

228
00:19:04,507 --> 00:19:06,441
Hisashi?

229
00:19:06,541 --> 00:19:10,374
Look, Takashi, he's getting up!
He's getting better...

230
00:19:14,741 --> 00:19:16,607
Hisashi?

231
00:19:20,307 --> 00:19:22,741
[Rei] What's the matter?

232
00:19:22,841 --> 00:19:25,341
[growl]

233
00:19:25,441 --> 00:19:27,307
Hisashi!

234
00:19:28,674 --> 00:19:29,941
No way...

235
00:19:30,041 --> 00:19:32,007
This can't be true...

236
00:19:32,107 --> 00:19:34,041
No way!

237
00:19:35,341 --> 00:19:37,807
I know you can't believe it.

238
00:19:39,707 --> 00:19:41,307
I can't believe it.

239
00:19:42,141 --> 00:19:44,207
Takashi...

240
00:19:46,174 --> 00:19:47,507
[Takashi] But it's happening...

241
00:19:47,607 --> 00:19:48,807
Don't do it.

242
00:19:48,907 --> 00:19:51,107
It's happening!

243
00:19:55,907 --> 00:19:58,407
[Rei] No!

244
00:21:32,607 --> 00:21:34,807
[Rei] Why?

245
00:21:34,907 --> 00:21:36,274
Why?

246
00:21:36,374 --> 00:21:39,341
[Takashi] He would have bitten
you if I didn't do that.

247
00:21:39,441 --> 00:21:41,541
[Rei] I didn't ask you
to save me!

248
00:21:41,641 --> 00:21:47,307
And how would you know that
anyway? What are you,
some expert?

249
00:21:47,407 --> 00:21:49,641
And I would've been willing
to get bitten...

250
00:21:49,741 --> 00:21:53,974
better to die that way than
surviving by doing something
like this!

251
00:21:54,074 --> 00:21:57,074
[Takashi] I don't think Hisashi
would've wanted that for you.

252
00:21:57,174 --> 00:21:59,507
[Rei] How do you know
that, Takashi?!

253
00:22:01,507 --> 00:22:02,274
Oh, I know...

254
00:22:02,374 --> 00:22:03,841
I know!

255
00:22:03,941 --> 00:22:07,207
You must have hated Hisashi,
am I right?

256
00:22:07,307 --> 00:22:09,674
Because he was dating me!

257
00:22:15,107 --> 00:22:18,041
Hey, where do you think
you're going?

258
00:22:18,141 --> 00:22:20,441
You obviously don't want me
around anymore.

259
00:22:20,541 --> 00:22:22,807
I'll go downstairs and
smash 'em.

260
00:22:22,907 --> 00:22:24,841
Wh..What are you talking about?

261
00:22:24,941 --> 00:22:27,774
[Rei] You can't take on that
many of them by yourself!

262
00:22:31,207 --> 00:22:34,107
Hey wait, Takashi?

263
00:22:36,641 --> 00:22:39,641
No! Stop it!

264
00:22:39,741 --> 00:22:44,807
I'm sorry! I didn't mean it!
I really didn't mean it!

265
00:22:44,907 --> 00:22:48,507
So please, please stay with me.

266
00:22:48,607 --> 00:22:50,241
Don't leave me!

267
00:23:09,174 --> 00:23:13,041
[Takashi] <i>On the day everything</i>
<i>came to an end...</i>

268
00:23:13,141 --> 00:23:15,507
<i>I killed my best friend.</i>

269
00:23:17,007 --> 00:23:21,374
<i>Then I held the girl that</i>
<i>I loved for the first time</i>
<i>in my life.</i>
