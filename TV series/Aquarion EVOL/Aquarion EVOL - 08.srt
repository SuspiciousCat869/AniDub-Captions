1
00:00:15,791 --> 00:00:16,833
"Why do you dig?

2
00:00:16,916 --> 00:00:18,500
What drives you to do it?"

3
00:00:18,583 --> 00:00:20,375
When legendary tunnel engineer

4
00:00:20,458 --> 00:00:23,500
and all around badass
Alejandro Vedernikov was asked

5
00:00:23,583 --> 00:00:27,041
those questions, he responded
the way any digger would.

6
00:00:28,166 --> 00:00:30,500
"Because, on the other
side of that dirt lies

7
00:00:30,583 --> 00:00:33,666
a new world just waiting
for me to uncover it!"

8
00:00:41,583 --> 00:00:43,625
I'm gonna get all up
in that new world!

9
00:00:46,083 --> 00:00:49,625
Ladies! Ready or not,
here comes Andy!

10
00:00:54,708 --> 00:00:56,333
Hey, where the heck are they?

11
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:01,000
Jackpot.

12
00:02:34,666 --> 00:02:37,875
Here they are, guys!
Get 'em while they're hot!

13
00:02:38,291 --> 00:02:39,250
Whoa!

14
00:02:39,333 --> 00:02:40,708
These are pics
from the field trip!

15
00:02:40,791 --> 00:02:42,708
When did you even take these?

16
00:02:42,791 --> 00:02:44,708
Oh come now, silly girl,

17
00:02:44,791 --> 00:02:47,250
don't you know a magician
never reveals her secrets?

18
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:49,125
Oo-oh! One of Shrade, please!

19
00:02:49,208 --> 00:02:51,583
All yours, hon!

20
00:02:51,666 --> 00:02:53,916
Jeez. I look terrible.

21
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,333
I think you look
awesome in this one.

22
00:02:59,208 --> 00:03:00,750
Oh yeah, super cute.

23
00:03:00,833 --> 00:03:02,958
Oh hey, nice shot,
are you gonna buy it?

24
00:03:03,041 --> 00:03:05,375
'Cause you could ditch
the two-dimensional girls

25
00:03:05,458 --> 00:03:07,208
for a flesh-and-blood hottie

26
00:03:07,291 --> 00:03:09,750
just waiting for a
connoisseur's eye.

27
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:18,291
Are there any of us who
don't launch you skyward?

28
00:03:18,375 --> 00:03:20,250
Hey! I can't help it!

29
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:23,958
Um, go ahead, take it.

30
00:03:31,416 --> 00:03:33,833
Hey, hey, look at you stud;
you're a chick magnet.

31
00:03:33,916 --> 00:03:35,541
Just mind your own business.

32
00:03:37,875 --> 00:03:39,541
Can I have this one please?

33
00:03:39,625 --> 00:03:41,458
That one?

34
00:03:41,541 --> 00:03:45,125
I guess so, long as
you've got the sheckels.

35
00:03:45,208 --> 00:03:46,708
Thank you.

36
00:03:46,791 --> 00:03:48,500
Say, who's that picture of?

37
00:03:48,583 --> 00:03:49,583
Oh. Uh--

38
00:03:49,666 --> 00:03:51,541
Don't be weird,
just let me see it!

39
00:03:51,625 --> 00:03:53,791
Wonder what it is.

40
00:03:53,875 --> 00:03:55,291
Amata and Andy?

41
00:03:55,375 --> 00:03:59,125
Definitely did not
see that one coming.

42
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,708
Yo, yo, check it
out my diggin' bro!

43
00:04:04,791 --> 00:04:08,083
You'll never believe what
I found in your hole!

44
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,458
What?

45
00:04:16,125 --> 00:04:18,500
Trust me dudes, there's
no way I'm wrong about this.

46
00:04:18,583 --> 00:04:21,708
It's the Book of Twin Stars,
I'm a hundred percent sure!

47
00:04:21,791 --> 00:04:23,541
Sorry, never heard of it.

48
00:04:23,625 --> 00:04:25,458
I know all about it.

49
00:04:26,291 --> 00:04:28,833
According to the
old stories, who-

50
00:04:28,916 --> 00:04:31,625
whoever holds that book
becomes Aquarion's master...

51
00:04:31,708 --> 00:04:34,083
unlocks the full arsenal--

52
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:38,333
Spoken like a
plushie in the know.

53
00:04:38,416 --> 00:04:40,291
Neo-DEAVA's been
looking for this bad boy

54
00:04:40,375 --> 00:04:41,791
since the beginning.

55
00:04:41,875 --> 00:04:43,916
So what's the deal, how'd
you find it in the first place?

56
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,708
Yeah, where did
you find it, Andy?

57
00:04:46,791 --> 00:04:50,958
I dug a hole, to get
to-- uh, doesn't matter!

58
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:53,375
No reason to get caught
up in the details.

59
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:56,750
Miss Chairwoman, please!

60
00:04:56,833 --> 00:04:59,791
We've earned the right to your
confidence; tell us the truth.

61
00:04:59,875 --> 00:05:01,791
The truth about what?

62
00:05:01,875 --> 00:05:04,041
Come on. You've been on
sabbatical for how long?

63
00:05:04,125 --> 00:05:06,833
You wouldn't just waltz back in
here unless something was up!

64
00:05:06,916 --> 00:05:09,583
Well, let's see, oh yes!

65
00:05:09,666 --> 00:05:13,291
That's right, I almost forgot!
I brought you a gift.

66
00:05:13,375 --> 00:05:15,541
That is not what we mean!

67
00:05:15,625 --> 00:05:17,166
Don't look a
gift-horse in the mouth.

68
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:19,833
How can we do our jobs if
you keep us in the dark?!

69
00:05:19,916 --> 00:05:22,375
They cannot read
with just their eyes.

70
00:05:22,458 --> 00:05:24,250
The book will only reveal itself

71
00:05:24,333 --> 00:05:27,375
to those special few
with eyes that cannot see.

72
00:05:29,166 --> 00:05:31,166
What the hell
declension is that?

73
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:35,708
Ugh! Rih, Rih, Ribbit.
Ribbit like a frog?

74
00:05:35,791 --> 00:05:37,208
What does that mean?

75
00:05:37,291 --> 00:05:39,750
All my nodding
off in Ancient Lit

76
00:05:39,833 --> 00:05:42,291
is finally coming
back to haunt me!

77
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:45,083
Red, help me out,
I suck at this!

78
00:05:45,166 --> 00:05:46,458
Sure.

79
00:05:46,541 --> 00:05:53,500
Let's see, duh, duh,
dig, dig, digger, digging.

80
00:05:53,583 --> 00:05:56,958
Is it digging?

81
00:05:57,041 --> 00:06:01,166
I'm sorry. He should know;
I've always owed him.

82
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,333
Mikono. What're you sorry for?

83
00:06:06,416 --> 00:06:08,041
What could you have done?

84
00:06:13,666 --> 00:06:17,625
Get ready to have
your mind blown!

85
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:20,458
Put some shoes on.

86
00:06:20,541 --> 00:06:23,458
Ancient Lesson Number One,
'All socks must be white!'

87
00:06:23,541 --> 00:06:25,041
Wait, what?

88
00:06:25,125 --> 00:06:27,583
First line of the book, it took
him all night to figure out.

89
00:06:27,666 --> 00:06:29,000
Hell yeah!

90
00:06:29,083 --> 00:06:31,166
Chapter twenty three,
verse one has been dominated.

91
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:33,625
That's right, and
I figured it all out myself.

92
00:06:33,708 --> 00:06:36,916
Great, but what the hell do
socks have to do with Aquarion?

93
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,166
Yeah Daddy's got a
little theory about that.

94
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:42,083
The writings of ancient
wrestling enthusiasts

95
00:06:42,166 --> 00:06:43,291
tell us fighters

96
00:06:43,375 --> 00:06:44,750
who lost their shoes
were at a disadvantage.

97
00:06:44,833 --> 00:06:46,583
Shoes are important
'cause they protect our feet.

98
00:06:46,666 --> 00:06:49,083
Feet are important
'cause they make us stand.

99
00:06:49,166 --> 00:06:50,958
Standing's important
so we don't fall down

100
00:06:51,041 --> 00:06:52,458
like idiots all the time.

101
00:06:52,541 --> 00:06:53,708
White socks matter

102
00:06:53,791 --> 00:06:55,958
'cause we wear 'em on
our most precious parts.

103
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:57,833
Well, second most anyway.

104
00:06:57,916 --> 00:07:01,208
White clothing that covers
our precious body parts?

105
00:07:03,125 --> 00:07:05,291
Her panties are teal, not white.

106
00:07:10,125 --> 00:07:12,666
What color do I have on?
Take a guess.

107
00:07:13,541 --> 00:07:15,833
Yeah--yeah, real funny,
laugh it up chuckles!

108
00:07:15,916 --> 00:07:18,708
Ancient documents
are serious bidness!

109
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:24,458
I just don't know
what people see in her.

110
00:07:24,541 --> 00:07:26,000
What ancient documents?

111
00:07:26,083 --> 00:07:28,958
Andy here thinks
he found something.

112
00:07:29,041 --> 00:07:31,625
Huh, let me see that.

113
00:07:31,708 --> 00:07:33,541
Uh, okay.

114
00:07:33,625 --> 00:07:35,166
You even know how to
read that gibberish?

115
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:38,666
Literature is my
specialty. Wait, what?

116
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:41,750
I think it says 'all girl's
tops must be fully buttoned up.'

117
00:07:41,833 --> 00:07:43,041
For real?

118
00:07:43,125 --> 00:07:44,416
That seems kinda random.

119
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,750
'No hair shall grow
past the eye brows.'

120
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:48,666
Weird.

121
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:50,375
'No one shall dye their hair.

122
00:07:50,458 --> 00:07:53,208
All skirts must extend five
centimeters below the kneecap.

123
00:07:53,291 --> 00:07:55,041
And no running
in the hallways.'

124
00:07:55,125 --> 00:07:56,541
Those sound like school rules.

125
00:07:56,625 --> 00:08:00,458
Indeed, but not just any
school rules, ancient ones.

126
00:08:00,541 --> 00:08:02,333
I think it's a student handbook.

127
00:08:05,958 --> 00:08:07,458
What's the matter with him?

128
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:21,416
In order to find the
most powerful Rare Igura,

129
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:24,250
we must lay siege
to Vega once more.

130
00:08:26,791 --> 00:08:28,083
We've come close,

131
00:08:28,166 --> 00:08:30,333
but the Iguras brought
back have been insufficient.

132
00:08:30,416 --> 00:08:32,375
The dimensional
transference either killed them

133
00:08:32,458 --> 00:08:34,083
or rendered them sterile.

134
00:08:34,166 --> 00:08:37,125
We must keep searching
for an answer.

135
00:08:39,416 --> 00:08:43,541
Speaking for myself, I think
I'd be happy with just Alicia.

136
00:08:43,625 --> 00:08:48,000
Jin, the fate of Altair hangs
in the balance of our actions.

137
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,125
The first signs were bad enough.

138
00:08:53,208 --> 00:08:55,000
When baby girls stop being born

139
00:08:55,083 --> 00:08:57,875
on your planet,
it gives one pause.

140
00:08:57,958 --> 00:08:59,833
When women began
dying off in droves

141
00:08:59,916 --> 00:09:02,708
from indeterminate causes,
the end of life

142
00:09:02,791 --> 00:09:04,916
as we knew it seemed nigh.

143
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,333
Eventually only men
remained on Altair.

144
00:09:12,083 --> 00:09:15,416
This is not a colonization
of Vega by any means,

145
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:19,041
we only want to ensure the
survival of our species.

146
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:21,333
For that to happen, we must find

147
00:09:21,416 --> 00:09:25,083
the most powerful Rare Igura,
one strong enough

148
00:09:25,166 --> 00:09:28,000
to survive
transdimensional travel.

149
00:09:28,083 --> 00:09:29,666
She'll be our Eve, the bride

150
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:32,958
who will bear the next
generation of Altair.

151
00:09:33,041 --> 00:09:35,458
Vega's definitely
the place to look.

152
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:39,125
There's a good chance our
savior pilots the Machine Angel.

153
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:43,833
I understand what needs
to be done, Commander.

154
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:45,625
I'll go down there
myself this time

155
00:09:45,708 --> 00:09:47,958
instead of piloting it remotely.

156
00:09:48,041 --> 00:09:49,750
As the last son of Altair,

157
00:09:49,833 --> 00:09:54,166
no other choice
remains, Jin--duty calls.

158
00:09:57,166 --> 00:09:59,000
I'll dial up the
optical sensors.

159
00:09:59,083 --> 00:10:02,083
I think it's definitely best
if I focus on solid ammo,

160
00:10:02,166 --> 00:10:04,333
so I don't end up
like last time.

161
00:10:04,416 --> 00:10:07,208
I'd better take some
infiltrator shells too,

162
00:10:07,291 --> 00:10:10,083
and I'll add heavy
armor just in case.

163
00:10:10,166 --> 00:10:14,125
It's the perfect defense,
a flawless shield.

164
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:18,583
Man, I looked like a straight
up jack-ass today!

165
00:10:18,666 --> 00:10:20,833
I dunno, an ancient
school handbook

166
00:10:20,916 --> 00:10:22,333
from who knows how long ago?

167
00:10:22,416 --> 00:10:24,000
That's a pretty decent find.

168
00:10:24,083 --> 00:10:25,708
You're right,
we should totally donate it

169
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:27,833
to a Neo-Kowloon museum!

170
00:10:27,916 --> 00:10:29,083
Who cares?

171
00:10:29,166 --> 00:10:31,166
Those geezers from back
in the day were weirdos.

172
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:33,916
Who has rules about the
length of your hair and skirt?

173
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,166
You're wrong!

174
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:37,375
We can learn tons from
the annals of history.

175
00:10:37,458 --> 00:10:39,208
In fact, if you
want my opinion,

176
00:10:39,291 --> 00:10:40,625
think things are
just a little bit

177
00:10:40,708 --> 00:10:42,625
too loosey-goosey
in the here and now!

178
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:44,500
Huh?

179
00:10:44,875 --> 00:10:46,208
Your clothes are skanky.

180
00:10:46,291 --> 00:10:48,208
They should not be
allowed in this school!

181
00:10:48,291 --> 00:10:49,583
Don't you get tired
of boys perving

182
00:10:49,666 --> 00:10:51,375
out on you all the time?!

183
00:10:51,458 --> 00:10:53,166
Huh? I like my clothes.

184
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:54,583
Look at what you're wearing.

185
00:10:54,666 --> 00:10:56,041
What do you think
the ancient texts have

186
00:10:56,125 --> 00:10:57,916
to say about you
flaunting those beasts?

187
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,291
You may as well come to class
oiled up and ready to go!

188
00:11:01,375 --> 00:11:03,041
Oiled up?

189
00:11:04,625 --> 00:11:06,750
I suggest we stall our
backslide toward Gomorrah

190
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:09,041
by taking a page
from the ancients.

191
00:11:09,125 --> 00:11:12,708
First off, Zessica, no more
gallivanting about like a madam!

192
00:11:12,791 --> 00:11:14,583
Man, why'm I being punished

193
00:11:14,666 --> 00:11:16,291
'cause I'm fashion forward?

194
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:19,541
Hey Amata. Tell the truth,
is my outfit too much?

195
00:11:19,625 --> 00:11:22,375
Well uh, it's not
my place to say.

196
00:11:22,458 --> 00:11:24,250
I mean, um--

197
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,666
Seems somebody knows
how to get our boy up.

198
00:11:55,583 --> 00:11:57,625
What do you think, Shush?

199
00:11:57,708 --> 00:11:59,541
Is it me?
I mean, guys like girls

200
00:11:59,625 --> 00:12:02,416
who wear skimpy clothing
like this, right?

201
00:12:03,791 --> 00:12:07,083
Wow, feeling a bit naughty, eh?

202
00:12:07,166 --> 00:12:08,625
Zessica!

203
00:12:08,708 --> 00:12:11,541
Let me see.

204
00:12:11,625 --> 00:12:14,125
I like it but you could
show a little more skin.

205
00:12:14,208 --> 00:12:16,583
Don't be afraid to flaunt it.

206
00:12:16,666 --> 00:12:19,500
No way, I'm not like you,
all right?!

207
00:12:21,708 --> 00:12:24,458
Abductors have been
detected in Neo-Kowloon!

208
00:12:31,291 --> 00:12:33,208
Here I am, you son of a bitch.

209
00:12:33,291 --> 00:12:34,708
Come and get me.

210
00:12:34,791 --> 00:12:37,750
We need to act fast before
he launches an attack.

211
00:12:37,833 --> 00:12:41,166
Why do I get the feeling he's
not here to abduct anyone?

212
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:45,041
Zen, if it's not an abduction,
what could it be?

213
00:12:45,125 --> 00:12:49,375
The Heavy Armor Radius
Gnis comes to make war.

214
00:12:49,458 --> 00:12:51,833
Send out Aquarion now!

215
00:12:51,916 --> 00:12:55,250
Amata at the head, Zessica
and Mikono, you're with him!

216
00:12:55,333 --> 00:12:56,125
Mikono?

217
00:12:56,208 --> 00:12:56,833
Why her?

218
00:12:56,916 --> 00:12:59,625
No way; I can't go.

219
00:12:59,708 --> 00:13:01,208
Come on!

220
00:13:17,541 --> 00:13:19,666
Vector Z, ready for launch!

221
00:13:21,208 --> 00:13:23,416
Vector Y, ready for launch!

222
00:13:24,833 --> 00:13:27,375
Vector X, ready as I'll ever be!

223
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:42,875
The enemy Abductor's up ahead!

224
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:45,291
Get ready, Mikono,
we're almost there!

225
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:51,833
Defensive Merge! Go! Aquarion!

226
00:14:04,791 --> 00:14:07,416
Aquarion Evol!

227
00:14:08,833 --> 00:14:11,125
Amata, what am I supposed to do?

228
00:14:11,208 --> 00:14:14,250
Just follow my lead.
This ends today!

229
00:14:14,583 --> 00:14:16,458
You hear me, ugly bastard?!

230
00:14:19,083 --> 00:14:22,833
Infinity punch!

231
00:14:29,166 --> 00:14:30,333
This guy's tough.

232
00:14:30,416 --> 00:14:31,500
Oh, I learned my lesson

233
00:14:31,583 --> 00:14:33,375
from the first time
you used that trick.

234
00:14:33,458 --> 00:14:35,333
You gotta vary it up.

235
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:46,625
These kids are the
Rare Iguras? Impossible.

236
00:14:46,708 --> 00:14:49,125
Compared to Silvie
these wimps are nothing.

237
00:14:49,666 --> 00:14:52,541
Damn you, Jin!
Don't you touch her!

238
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:57,250
Mikono belongs to me!
Me, you son of a bitch!

239
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:02,291
Ahh, screaming is such

240
00:15:02,375 --> 00:15:04,208
a plebian method
of communication.

241
00:15:04,291 --> 00:15:06,791
A touch more civility,
if you please.

242
00:15:07,333 --> 00:15:09,083
Give over to the jealousy.

243
00:15:09,166 --> 00:15:12,541
Feel it with every fiber
of your being, Kagura.

244
00:15:12,625 --> 00:15:15,916
Wallow in the pain of having
the one you love stolen.

245
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,541
Drink it all the way down.

246
00:15:25,833 --> 00:15:27,791
If you're the best
they have to offer,

247
00:15:27,875 --> 00:15:29,708
let's see what you're made of.

248
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,333
No effect on Aquarion's
external armor!

249
00:15:48,416 --> 00:15:50,416
But it is affecting
the Elements!

250
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:53,500
That's not good.
What is happening?

251
00:15:53,583 --> 00:15:55,291
He's using Infiltrator ammo,

252
00:15:55,375 --> 00:15:56,916
kicking up violent shockwaves.

253
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,208
Basically destroying
Aquarion from the inside.

254
00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:14,125
Help her!

255
00:16:14,208 --> 00:16:16,166
Their aura levels
are dropping rapidly, sir.

256
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:18,416
The merge is falling apart!

257
00:16:28,166 --> 00:16:29,666
No!

258
00:16:30,333 --> 00:16:31,708
Don't look away.

259
00:16:31,791 --> 00:16:34,625
Internalize every
moment of this.

260
00:16:34,708 --> 00:16:36,375
I want you to watch Jin violate

261
00:16:36,458 --> 00:16:39,791
your precious bitch
right under your nose.

262
00:16:39,875 --> 00:16:43,541
Stop this! Stop this!

263
00:16:48,666 --> 00:16:50,000
Beyond pathetic.

264
00:16:50,083 --> 00:16:51,791
There's no way in hell
one of these nothings

265
00:16:51,875 --> 00:16:54,250
could possibly be our True Eve.

266
00:16:54,333 --> 00:16:56,666
The Element suits have
been heavily damaged!

267
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:58,208
If we don't do something,
the shock'll

268
00:16:58,291 --> 00:17:00,666
go right through the suits and
tear their bodies to shreds!

269
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:03,458
Mikono! I will not
let this happen.

270
00:17:03,541 --> 00:17:07,041
Put me in right now!
High Commander! C'mon!

271
00:17:08,166 --> 00:17:10,083
Zessica, watch your six!

272
00:17:29,708 --> 00:17:31,291
Whoa! What was that?!

273
00:17:37,291 --> 00:17:38,666
That was so weird.

274
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:41,166
I could feel the
missiles on my skin.

275
00:17:44,416 --> 00:17:45,916
What's going on up there?

276
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,958
How odd. What could
it possibly mean?

277
00:17:49,041 --> 00:17:51,791
Without the constricting
burden of clothing,

278
00:17:51,875 --> 00:17:54,166
the senses become
stronger, more acute.

279
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:55,541
Remove your suits

280
00:17:55,625 --> 00:17:58,708
and let nakedness rivet
you to the pulse of life!

281
00:17:58,791 --> 00:18:00,083
The newfound freedom
will allow you

282
00:18:00,166 --> 00:18:03,000
to sense your enemy's moves
with utmost precision.

283
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:04,541
Hold on, you're saying
the fewer clothes

284
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:06,958
I'm wearing the better I'll
be at dodging his attacks?!

285
00:18:07,041 --> 00:18:09,333
We can't pilot these naked!

286
00:18:10,166 --> 00:18:12,666
This is no time to
be a prude, Mikono!

287
00:18:19,791 --> 00:18:21,041
Zessica?!

288
00:18:24,791 --> 00:18:26,375
Well, here goes nothing!

289
00:18:36,625 --> 00:18:38,833
Whoa, Mikono's doin' it too?

290
00:18:38,916 --> 00:18:41,000
Mikono and Zessica's
mind levels are rising!

291
00:18:41,083 --> 00:18:43,458
Both Vectors are primed
and ready to merge!

292
00:18:43,541 --> 00:18:46,208
Now! Merge away!

293
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:48,041
Zessica, you're the head!

294
00:18:48,708 --> 00:18:52,291
Unguarded Merge! Go! Aquarion!

295
00:19:04,833 --> 00:19:07,791
Wow, my skin is so sensitive!

296
00:19:07,875 --> 00:19:10,000
This feels amazing!

297
00:19:10,083 --> 00:19:12,125
It's so intense!

298
00:19:16,166 --> 00:19:18,458
Aquarion Spada!

299
00:19:21,958 --> 00:19:23,833
I can feel Amata looking at me.

300
00:19:23,916 --> 00:19:26,333
Act normal. Don't freak out.

301
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:29,083
Mikono's mind level
is still on the rise, sir!

302
00:19:29,166 --> 00:19:30,625
What? But why?

303
00:19:30,708 --> 00:19:32,041
She knows someone's
looking at her

304
00:19:32,125 --> 00:19:34,208
so her body's getting
all hot and bothered.

305
00:19:34,291 --> 00:19:35,791
I can relate.

306
00:19:38,083 --> 00:19:39,375
Oh, don't worry.

307
00:19:39,458 --> 00:19:42,041
There's no need to
be embarrassed at all.

308
00:19:44,125 --> 00:19:45,208
Am I supposed to be afraid

309
00:19:45,291 --> 00:19:47,250
'cause you decided
to merge again?

310
00:19:47,333 --> 00:19:49,291
Just give up and admit defeat!

311
00:19:51,458 --> 00:19:52,875
Hell no!

312
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:57,291
I can sense his every move.

313
00:19:58,958 --> 00:20:01,416
The moment
he thinks it, I feel it!

314
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:09,875
How did they evade that?

315
00:20:14,583 --> 00:20:16,500
Clothes off!

316
00:20:16,583 --> 00:20:18,666
Strip down!

317
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:20,791
Zessica's aura is soaring.

318
00:20:20,875 --> 00:20:22,083
It's about to go off the charts!

319
00:20:22,166 --> 00:20:24,500
Take this, jerk!

320
00:20:25,291 --> 00:20:28,458
Okay, here I go!

321
00:20:32,416 --> 00:20:35,000
They make such a
beautiful music.

322
00:20:35,083 --> 00:20:37,958
One that eludes me. Brava.

323
00:20:44,041 --> 00:20:46,416
We are born without
clothing on our backs,

324
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:48,500
and we are made
to fight that way!

325
00:20:48,583 --> 00:20:52,458
Let your skin set aboil.
Let your body be free!

326
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:00,625
No clothes!

327
00:21:00,708 --> 00:21:01,625
No guard!

328
00:21:01,708 --> 00:21:03,458
Attack!

329
00:21:14,583 --> 00:21:16,041
Game over for me.

330
00:21:16,125 --> 00:21:19,750
How did I lose to these
assholes? This is crap!

331
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:25,291
Yeah!

332
00:21:31,541 --> 00:21:33,625
I'm sorry!

333
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:36,458
Why do I feel so embarrassed?

334
00:21:36,541 --> 00:21:38,500
I don't understand.

335
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:43,250
Effective defense
is a good offense.

336
00:21:43,333 --> 00:21:47,375
Always. Letting your guard
down is the ultimate weapon.

337
00:21:47,458 --> 00:21:50,250
That was disgusting
and I will not stand for it!

338
00:21:50,333 --> 00:21:51,833
It's a universal truth.

339
00:21:51,916 --> 00:21:55,041
We're all born the
same way. Naked.

340
00:21:59,583 --> 00:22:01,125
Sound as that strategy may be,

341
00:22:01,208 --> 00:22:02,625
it's a double-edged sword.

342
00:22:02,708 --> 00:22:04,375
In exchange for perfect senses,

343
00:22:04,458 --> 00:22:05,958
Elements give up their defense

344
00:22:06,041 --> 00:22:08,250
and leave themselves
fully exposed.

345
00:22:08,333 --> 00:22:11,125
Speaking of exposed,

346
00:22:11,208 --> 00:22:14,416
I believe it's best we put
our clothes back on for now.

347
00:22:20,083 --> 00:22:23,041
These pics... how in the
world did you take these?!

348
00:22:23,125 --> 00:22:25,041
Umm, here's
five hundred kowloons.

349
00:22:25,125 --> 00:22:26,375
Enjoy!

350
00:22:29,375 --> 00:22:30,333
Wait, how much?!

351
00:22:30,416 --> 00:22:31,000
Put me down for one!

352
00:22:31,083 --> 00:22:32,541
Me too!

353
00:22:32,625 --> 00:22:35,000
Stop it! You're forbidden to
sell those, you understand me?!

354
00:22:35,333 --> 00:22:36,000
Step right up!

355
00:22:36,083 --> 00:22:37,250
Hey, Zess.

356
00:22:37,333 --> 00:22:39,166
What're you doing
over here by yourself?

357
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:41,708
Uh, nothing. Gotta run!

358
00:24:22,666 --> 00:24:26,250
Say the word "holy" ten
times as fast as you can.

359
00:24:26,333 --> 00:24:29,416
Holy--holy--holy--holy--holy--
holy--holy--hole-- hole--hole!

360
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:31,625
Argh! Holes are for filling in!

361
00:24:31,708 --> 00:24:35,416
