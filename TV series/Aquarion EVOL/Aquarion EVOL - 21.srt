1
00:00:17,416 --> 00:00:19,833
[MALLOY] Any girl who goes
to Altair either bites it

2
00:00:19,916 --> 00:00:21,416
or turns into a man.

3
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:23,416
So that means Mix is--

4
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:24,708
Well, we found her,

5
00:00:24,791 --> 00:00:26,250
but she wasn't Mix anymore...

6
00:00:26,333 --> 00:00:28,416
She was brainwashed
or something.

7
00:00:29,416 --> 00:00:31,458
Zess, Yunoha, are you all right?

8
00:00:31,541 --> 00:00:33,250
Yeah, we're okay now...

9
00:00:33,333 --> 00:00:34,458
Our check-ups and everything

10
00:00:34,541 --> 00:00:36,583
came back normal,
so that's good...

11
00:00:36,666 --> 00:00:38,625
But if we hadn't
left when we did...

12
00:00:38,708 --> 00:00:40,041
I just don't know.

13
00:00:45,125 --> 00:00:47,166
What about Mikono,
has she come back yet?

14
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:48,250
No, she's still off trying

15
00:00:48,333 --> 00:00:50,125
to track down Commander Fudo...

16
00:00:50,208 --> 00:00:53,833
But... what's the
latest on Shrade?

17
00:00:53,916 --> 00:00:56,125
He seems stable at the moment...

18
00:00:56,208 --> 00:00:57,875
But who knows if it'll take.

19
00:00:57,958 --> 00:00:59,208
Dammit...

20
00:00:59,291 --> 00:01:00,458
[MALLOY] The High Commander's
missing in action

21
00:01:00,541 --> 00:01:02,875
and Shrade's two steps
away from tapping out...

22
00:01:02,958 --> 00:01:05,125
Neo-DEAVA is as good as sunk!

23
00:01:05,208 --> 00:01:07,583
[ANDY] So what,
we should just surrender?

24
00:01:09,375 --> 00:01:11,375
This thing's not done
'til it's done...!

25
00:01:11,458 --> 00:01:13,083
We should regroup,
head back to Altair

26
00:01:13,166 --> 00:01:15,291
and show those scumbags
what we're made of!

27
00:01:15,375 --> 00:01:16,541
[AMATA]
Andy.

28
00:01:16,625 --> 00:01:18,375
I refuse to give up on Mix...

29
00:01:18,458 --> 00:01:19,916
I'll save her--

30
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,125
Andy...! What's wrong?!

31
00:01:26,208 --> 00:01:27,541
It's nothing.

32
00:01:27,625 --> 00:01:30,375
Don't worry,
I'm perfectly fine...

33
00:01:30,458 --> 00:01:32,958
I won't give up on her...!
You hear me...?

34
00:01:33,041 --> 00:01:35,208
I'll save Mix if it's
the last thing I do!

35
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:14,541
[SHRADE] I almost got there...
so close I could touch it.

36
00:03:15,541 --> 00:03:17,708
The perfect melody of love...

37
00:03:17,791 --> 00:03:20,708
undulating between
our two worlds.

38
00:03:21,458 --> 00:03:22,875
[CAYENNE]
All right, relax.

39
00:03:22,958 --> 00:03:25,416
If you push yourself too hard

40
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:26,500
you'll make it worse...

41
00:03:26,583 --> 00:03:28,041
You need to rest.

42
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:32,375
[SHRADE] I wonder whether
I'll be allotted the time

43
00:03:32,458 --> 00:03:33,583
to write it all out

44
00:03:33,666 --> 00:03:37,625
before my body turns
on itself for good...

45
00:03:37,708 --> 00:03:39,708
Please, friend...

46
00:03:39,791 --> 00:03:43,125
use your second sight
to give me some idea...

47
00:03:43,208 --> 00:03:45,166
[CAYENNE]
Do you really want to know?

48
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:48,416
I've nothing to
fear from sorrow...

49
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:52,250
It can only enhance
the beauty of my music.

50
00:03:53,125 --> 00:03:55,083
Guess so...

51
00:03:56,541 --> 00:03:58,958
[SHRADE]
If I ever do finish the song...

52
00:03:59,041 --> 00:04:02,375
Please... will you
play it with me?

53
00:04:02,791 --> 00:04:03,958
[DONAR]
Do we have any idea

54
00:04:04,041 --> 00:04:06,083
when High Commander Fudo
will come back to us?

55
00:04:06,166 --> 00:04:07,541
[SUOMI]
And don't forget about Mikono,

56
00:04:07,625 --> 00:04:09,583
she's still missing too!

57
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:12,625
Please have one,
Miss Suomi... I insist.

58
00:04:12,708 --> 00:04:13,958
No thanks...

59
00:04:14,041 --> 00:04:16,333
I avoid calorically dense
food this late at night.

60
00:04:16,416 --> 00:04:18,458
Oh... Fine...

61
00:04:18,541 --> 00:04:21,583
Trust me, there's
nothing to worry about.

62
00:04:21,666 --> 00:04:24,833
Fudo will return
to us very soon...

63
00:04:24,916 --> 00:04:27,875
And with him will
come the key to Genesis.

64
00:04:32,625 --> 00:04:35,416
[MIKAGE] Prostrate and
yet void of slumber.

65
00:04:38,541 --> 00:04:41,083
[MIKAGE]
Tell me, she of emerald tresses.

66
00:04:41,166 --> 00:04:42,666
Did you delight
in peering through

67
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:44,375
the gate I opened for you?

68
00:04:44,458 --> 00:04:47,083
It's you... No!

69
00:04:52,833 --> 00:04:55,083
[MIKAGE] Do not neglect
to keep your promise.

70
00:04:55,166 --> 00:04:56,375
Promise?

71
00:04:57,333 --> 00:05:00,000
You lie... I promised nothing.

72
00:05:00,083 --> 00:05:03,250
[MIKAGE] Perhaps your
memory betrays you...

73
00:05:03,333 --> 00:05:04,666
Yet the nature of your promise

74
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:07,958
was such that memory
won't be required.

75
00:05:22,833 --> 00:05:24,375
Oh, Mix.

76
00:05:29,208 --> 00:05:30,833
I finally saw 'em...

77
00:05:30,916 --> 00:05:31,875
I got to take a peek

78
00:05:31,958 --> 00:05:34,208
at those big,
glorious gazongas...

79
00:05:34,291 --> 00:05:35,875
But... I guess they weren't all

80
00:05:35,958 --> 00:05:38,000
that big anymore, were they?

81
00:05:39,958 --> 00:05:40,750
[AMATA]
Andy!

82
00:05:40,833 --> 00:05:42,083
Dude, what are you doing here?

83
00:05:42,166 --> 00:05:44,333
[ANDY]
I don't really have a choice.

84
00:05:44,416 --> 00:05:47,208
If I don't stay put, I'll sink.

85
00:05:48,166 --> 00:05:49,458
[AMATA]
Hey, wait...

86
00:05:49,541 --> 00:05:51,583
That's one of
the holes Mix filled.

87
00:05:51,666 --> 00:05:54,583
[ANDY] Yep... And she filled
it in damn good too...

88
00:05:54,666 --> 00:05:57,041
there's not a weak point
in the entire thing...

89
00:05:57,125 --> 00:05:58,375
I'm safe here...

90
00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:00,166
Even if my power does overload,

91
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:02,666
there's no way
I can sink into it.

92
00:06:04,916 --> 00:06:06,791
You okay?

93
00:06:06,875 --> 00:06:08,791
[ANDY]
No, Amata...

94
00:06:08,875 --> 00:06:11,875
I mean, even if I found
a way to get her back...

95
00:06:11,958 --> 00:06:13,875
It wouldn't be the same.

96
00:06:13,958 --> 00:06:16,791
Now that she's not a
girl anymore, would I...

97
00:06:16,875 --> 00:06:20,291
Would I love her the same...?
Would it be different?

98
00:06:35,791 --> 00:06:36,875
[KAGURA]
Well, well...

99
00:06:36,958 --> 00:06:39,041
If it isn't the
little pain in my ass

100
00:06:39,125 --> 00:06:40,708
who doesn't have a scent.

101
00:06:45,708 --> 00:06:47,208
Hey... Let go!

102
00:06:47,291 --> 00:06:49,833
Why are you running
away from me?!

103
00:06:54,583 --> 00:06:57,041
[KAGUra]
We've finally become one!

104
00:06:57,541 --> 00:06:59,208
[MIKONO]
Apollo.

105
00:06:59,291 --> 00:07:01,416
Apollo...! Here I am!

106
00:07:04,375 --> 00:07:06,500
[MIKONO]
You came for me.

107
00:07:06,583 --> 00:07:08,916
Do you know how
long I've been waiting?

108
00:07:09,458 --> 00:07:10,708
Mikono.

109
00:07:10,791 --> 00:07:12,041
Sorry, wench...

110
00:07:12,125 --> 00:07:16,000
Your friend Apollon isn't
here... We're Amagura!

111
00:07:20,833 --> 00:07:22,791
[AMATA]
Wait...! Mikono!

112
00:07:23,833 --> 00:07:26,166
[KAGURA] There's nowhere
you can run from me!

113
00:07:30,625 --> 00:07:32,041
Stop...! Let her go!

114
00:07:32,125 --> 00:07:34,125
[KAGURA]
Shut up! Join us...

115
00:07:34,208 --> 00:07:36,458
Come and claim your destiny.

116
00:07:36,541 --> 00:07:42,291
Help... Please!
Let go...! Amata...!

117
00:07:42,375 --> 00:07:43,750
[AMATA]
No!

118
00:07:43,833 --> 00:07:46,541
Please! No...!

119
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:57,791
What was that?

120
00:08:11,916 --> 00:08:13,291
Thanks a lot.

121
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,000
When you clap
your hands together,

122
00:08:17,083 --> 00:08:19,500
what remains in
the space between...?

123
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:21,333
Do you know, child?

124
00:08:21,416 --> 00:08:22,666
Huh?

125
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:25,708
One right, one left...
Angel and human...

126
00:08:25,791 --> 00:08:28,958
Plus and minus...
A man and a woman...

127
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:31,791
But what exists in
the gap between them?

128
00:08:36,333 --> 00:08:37,625
What's in the gap

129
00:08:37,708 --> 00:08:39,625
between my right and left hands?

130
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:47,708
Nothing.

131
00:08:48,833 --> 00:08:52,875
Empty space... but... warm.

132
00:08:55,291 --> 00:08:56,500
Wait a second...

133
00:08:56,583 --> 00:08:59,166
I feel like I've heard
this somewhere before.

134
00:09:08,625 --> 00:09:10,375
Eons upon eons ago...

135
00:09:10,458 --> 00:09:11,750
After the heavens and the earth

136
00:09:11,833 --> 00:09:13,708
were separated
from one another...

137
00:09:13,791 --> 00:09:17,583
The world was bathed in a
glorious, ephemeral light.

138
00:09:17,666 --> 00:09:19,666
The flowers sang.

139
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:22,083
All living creatures
whispered poems

140
00:09:22,166 --> 00:09:24,000
of love and kinship.

141
00:09:24,083 --> 00:09:25,625
And the angels cavorted

142
00:09:25,708 --> 00:09:28,708
in ecstasy amidst
the stars above.

143
00:09:28,791 --> 00:09:31,250
But the angels
were fierce hunters...

144
00:09:31,333 --> 00:09:33,500
And mankind the
prey they coveted

145
00:09:33,583 --> 00:09:35,541
more than any other.

146
00:09:35,625 --> 00:09:38,500
In the war against the humans,

147
00:09:38,583 --> 00:09:41,000
there fought an
Angel of great repute

148
00:09:41,083 --> 00:09:43,250
whose name was Apollonius...

149
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:47,041
He met a girl named
Celiane and they fell in love...

150
00:09:47,125 --> 00:09:49,875
It was their destiny.

151
00:09:49,958 --> 00:09:51,750
Apollonius betrayed his kind,

152
00:09:51,833 --> 00:09:52,791
and joined the humans,

153
00:09:52,875 --> 00:09:54,791
in the fight against
their harrowers.

154
00:09:57,375 --> 00:09:58,708
In the angels' world,

155
00:09:58,791 --> 00:10:01,083
the brand of traitor would
forever be on his head...

156
00:10:01,166 --> 00:10:02,125
But in the name of love,

157
00:10:02,208 --> 00:10:03,916
he cast off his wings...

158
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,583
And he gave the humans
an incredible weapon...

159
00:10:06,666 --> 00:10:09,291
He chose to pilot
a Machine Angel.

160
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:10,708
This is the legend as written

161
00:10:10,791 --> 00:10:13,125
in the ancient book of Genesis.

162
00:10:13,208 --> 00:10:14,875
So is that what really happened

163
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:16,833
twelve thousand years ago?

164
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:18,208
No.

165
00:10:18,291 --> 00:10:19,250
For every story,

166
00:10:19,333 --> 00:10:21,166
there's one that
comes before it...

167
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:22,291
This tale occurred

168
00:10:22,375 --> 00:10:24,666
a full twenty-four
thousand years ago.

169
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:28,875
The great wheel of
fate has turned again...

170
00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:32,208
And the legend is about
to be told once more.

171
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:36,333
Once more...? But how?

172
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:48,625
Amata Sora...!
Explain yourself...!

173
00:10:48,708 --> 00:10:51,083
I don't recall ordering
you to launch an attack!

174
00:10:51,166 --> 00:10:53,541
I'm sorry, but I have
to find Mikono.

175
00:10:53,625 --> 00:10:56,000
No, you are not
authorized to launch!

176
00:10:56,083 --> 00:10:57,875
She's calling out
to me somehow...!

177
00:10:57,958 --> 00:10:59,708
Pleading for me
to come save her...

178
00:10:59,791 --> 00:11:01,875
I have to go
before it's too late!

179
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:14,083
I promise...

180
00:11:14,166 --> 00:11:17,833
I won't let someone
I love slip away again.

181
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,291
[MIKAGE]
Let your passion guide you...

182
00:11:24,375 --> 00:11:26,500
Fly to the one you love...

183
00:11:26,583 --> 00:11:30,583
With haste...
Carve a path to Solar Wing.

184
00:11:30,666 --> 00:11:33,416
And thou, my fragmented soul...

185
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:37,166
Time to emerge from torpor
and embrace the night.

186
00:11:43,291 --> 00:11:44,416
Amata.

187
00:11:45,333 --> 00:11:46,916
[DONAR]
Vector Z's transmitter is down.

188
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,500
We're not gonna
be able to track him.

189
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:50,875
Cayenne, can you use
your Prophecy of Despair

190
00:11:50,958 --> 00:11:52,750
to pinpoint his location?

191
00:11:52,833 --> 00:11:55,208
I'll do my best, sir.

192
00:12:11,625 --> 00:12:12,750
No!

193
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:23,791
Hard to believe
this is the same place

194
00:12:23,875 --> 00:12:26,708
where Mikono and I first met.

195
00:12:26,791 --> 00:12:31,541
Oh man... What in the
world happened out here?

196
00:13:01,958 --> 00:13:03,750
[MIKONO]
Where are we?

197
00:13:03,833 --> 00:13:06,000
The space between
light and darkness...

198
00:13:06,083 --> 00:13:08,833
As is written in the
ancient book of Genesis.

199
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:13,458
There's nobody in the cockpit...

200
00:13:13,541 --> 00:13:15,416
Where could he have gone?

201
00:13:17,166 --> 00:13:19,875
[ZESSIca] This is where
Amata and I first met...

202
00:13:19,958 --> 00:13:23,666
And also... it's where we
merged for the first time.

203
00:13:32,166 --> 00:13:35,083
[AMATA]
It's like a ghost town.

204
00:13:35,166 --> 00:13:36,833
Doesn't make any sense,

205
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:38,458
where did they all go?

206
00:13:40,291 --> 00:13:41,583
[CAYENNE] I did hear rumors
they were forced

207
00:13:41,666 --> 00:13:45,083
to evacuate parts of the
city after that big battle.

208
00:13:45,166 --> 00:13:47,500
But I had no idea
it was this bad.

209
00:13:47,583 --> 00:13:49,666
[ZESSICA] In your vision,
was Mikono here too?

210
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:52,208
Yeah, it's what
I saw in the prophecy.

211
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:57,583
Amata... You did come
back here to track her down.

212
00:13:57,666 --> 00:13:58,583
[CAYENNE]
Come on...

213
00:13:58,666 --> 00:13:59,916
Let's split up
and look for them!

214
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:12,208
Anyone here?

215
00:14:39,333 --> 00:14:41,541
Where did...
all these come from?!

216
00:14:41,625 --> 00:14:45,541
They're not mine...
So whose are they?

217
00:14:48,791 --> 00:14:50,625
[KAGURA]
What am I supposed to do now...?

218
00:14:50,708 --> 00:14:54,416
I don't understand,
why did Mikage send me here?

219
00:14:58,083 --> 00:14:59,791
It smells like-

220
00:14:59,875 --> 00:15:01,750
This place feels so familiar...

221
00:15:01,833 --> 00:15:04,166
I'm sure I've
been here before...

222
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:06,291
But a long, long time ago.

223
00:15:27,708 --> 00:15:28,791
[ALICIA]
Amata.

224
00:15:29,541 --> 00:15:30,458
Amata.

225
00:15:31,833 --> 00:15:33,083
Amata!

226
00:15:51,625 --> 00:15:53,291
[MIKAGE] Seems those
painful memories have

227
00:15:53,375 --> 00:15:57,000
finally clawed their way
to the surface of your soul.

228
00:16:01,916 --> 00:16:04,333
A 'Flight of the
Aquaria' poster?

229
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:24,958
Mikono.

230
00:16:30,583 --> 00:16:31,583
Mikono!

231
00:16:38,791 --> 00:16:40,291
There you are!

232
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:42,583
Zessica...?
What are you doing here?

233
00:16:42,666 --> 00:16:47,291
Well, I uh...
came here to save you.

234
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:52,250
I mean, I'm uh,
just following orders...

235
00:16:52,333 --> 00:16:54,166
They sent me and Cayenne here.

236
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:57,083
Oh. Sorry...

237
00:16:57,166 --> 00:16:59,458
I hate that I've put
you guys in harm's way.

238
00:17:03,333 --> 00:17:04,958
[ZESSICA]
They evacuated the entire city,

239
00:17:05,041 --> 00:17:06,958
that's why it's so barren...

240
00:17:07,041 --> 00:17:09,208
There's not a
solitary soul left.

241
00:17:09,291 --> 00:17:12,583
[AMATA] No kidding...
It's lifeless as a graveyard.

242
00:17:12,666 --> 00:17:14,166
[ZESSICA]
Why would you disobey

243
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:17,083
a direct command just
to come to this place?

244
00:17:17,166 --> 00:17:19,791
[AMATA]
I don't know... I just--

245
00:17:19,875 --> 00:17:22,000
Just what?

246
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:24,750
I felt like Mikono
was beckoning me here.

247
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:33,375
[ALICIA] I shall wait for
you, my brave Apollon...

248
00:17:33,458 --> 00:17:36,208
For twelve-thousand
years, if I must...

249
00:17:43,208 --> 00:17:44,625
[ZESSICA]
So uh...

250
00:17:44,708 --> 00:17:47,041
You used to work in
this theater, right...?

251
00:17:47,125 --> 00:17:48,083
This is the place

252
00:17:48,166 --> 00:17:50,791
where you first
met Mikono too, huh?

253
00:17:50,875 --> 00:17:53,916
[AMATA]
Uh-huh...

254
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,000
[ZESSICA]
Amata... Next time.

255
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:01,625
After the next twelve
thousand years passes.

256
00:18:01,708 --> 00:18:03,250
Pick me!

257
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:12,541
[MIKAGE] 'Tis not the
place of wingless ones

258
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:16,125
to pay their little
hopes full tale.

259
00:18:16,208 --> 00:18:17,916
Not when a true legend is about

260
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,000
to come to pass right
before your very eyes.

261
00:18:25,083 --> 00:18:27,708
Zessica! Let's go... Hurry!

262
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:31,625
What's the matter
with you?! Come on!

263
00:18:40,916 --> 00:18:42,666
[MIKAGE]
Fly, my hapless pets...

00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:44,916
Fly swift and savage!

00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,041
Soar to the promised land!

00:19:11,791 --> 00:19:12,916
Zessica!

269
00:19:16,875 --> 00:19:18,375
Dammit!

270
00:19:18,458 --> 00:19:19,791
Stop... There's no point.

271
00:19:19,875 --> 00:19:21,625
I'm getting
you outta here!

272
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:27,375
Just forget me...!
Please, save yourself!

273
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:32,291
No way! Either you're
comin' with me... or I stay!

274
00:19:33,208 --> 00:19:34,541
A-Amata.

275
00:19:40,375 --> 00:19:43,583
I love you... So much.

276
00:19:56,666 --> 00:19:58,916
Zess, no...! I won't leave you!

277
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:10,125
Zessica!

278
00:20:14,125 --> 00:20:15,500
Amata...! Outta the way!

279
00:20:32,291 --> 00:20:33,625
[SAZANKA]
We've got your back, Cayenne!

280
00:20:33,708 --> 00:20:35,000
Sazanka...?

281
00:20:35,083 --> 00:20:37,625
Who's in the
other Vector...? Andy?

282
00:20:37,708 --> 00:20:39,416
I'm here for you, Cayenne...

283
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:42,041
You said you'd play the
piece when it was finished...

284
00:20:42,125 --> 00:20:43,416
And it's time.

285
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:44,750
Stop it...

286
00:20:44,833 --> 00:20:46,666
You can't merge in your
condition, it's not safe!

287
00:20:50,041 --> 00:20:51,833
Don't worry about me,
I'll be fine...

288
00:20:51,916 --> 00:20:52,875
Now come on!

289
00:20:52,958 --> 00:20:57,833
Precarious Merge...
Go...! Aquarion!

290
00:21:02,666 --> 00:21:04,500
Shrade... Why?

291
00:21:04,958 --> 00:21:06,750
My friend... Thank you!

292
00:21:06,833 --> 00:21:09,875
This is so Moe!

293
00:21:12,625 --> 00:21:15,125
[SHRADE]
Aquarion... Spada!

294
00:21:29,375 --> 00:21:33,083
You can run...
Ah, you know the rest!

295
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:35,458
No... Not now...

296
00:21:43,375 --> 00:21:46,041
[FUDO] Solar Wing is on
the verge of awakening...

297
00:21:46,125 --> 00:21:48,000
The time is upon us.

298
00:21:48,083 --> 00:21:52,291
I'm sorry... For all I've done.

299
00:21:52,375 --> 00:21:55,125
I am... I may not deserve it...

300
00:21:55,208 --> 00:21:56,833
But forgive me.

301
00:21:56,916 --> 00:22:02,458
Wait. So then...
you saw it, too?

302
00:22:02,541 --> 00:22:04,708
I saw it, but I didn't
think it was real;

303
00:22:04,791 --> 00:22:06,416
'least not at first.

304
00:22:25,541 --> 00:22:30,916
[KAGURA] I saw you, Amata,
unable to do a damn thing!

305
00:22:36,791 --> 00:22:38,416
[AMATA]
What you're saying is...?

306
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:41,916
[KAGURA]
That's right.

307
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,375
You and I are... one.

308
00:24:23,583 --> 00:24:25,458
[YUNOHA] I think Kagura
is a little bit wrong

309
00:24:25,541 --> 00:24:27,125
in the way he treats girls...

310
00:24:27,208 --> 00:24:30,083
And he might be confused
about what love means too...

311
00:24:30,166 --> 00:24:31,583
To love someone is to treat them

312
00:24:31,666 --> 00:24:36,625
the way you'd want
to be treated. Oh no!
