1
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:17,125
All of you are going
to be resurrected...

2
00:00:17,208 --> 00:00:19,625
Come back... I need you!

3
00:00:23,208 --> 00:00:24,541
[FUDO]
As time flows on

4
00:00:24,625 --> 00:00:27,458
our tribulations transform
us minute by minute,

5
00:00:27,541 --> 00:00:29,500
revive us second by second.

6
00:00:29,583 --> 00:00:32,666
Its inexorable current
has lead to this point...

7
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:35,791
The royal road... to change!

8
00:00:43,333 --> 00:00:44,500
[ZESSICA]
What happened?

9
00:00:44,583 --> 00:00:45,458
Mikono, hey...

10
00:00:45,541 --> 00:00:47,541
Happy Rebirthday!

11
00:00:56,125 --> 00:00:57,416
Not him!

12
00:02:36,083 --> 00:02:37,208
[KAGURA]
Hmph!

13
00:02:37,291 --> 00:02:39,541
All you losers smell weak.

14
00:02:39,625 --> 00:02:41,125
How did he get here?

15
00:02:42,291 --> 00:02:45,041
Wonderful...
It's the dog boy again.

16
00:02:48,625 --> 00:02:51,333
Complete the rite of
passage or stagnate...

17
00:02:51,416 --> 00:02:54,000
Expand your new lives...

18
00:02:54,083 --> 00:02:57,375
Let rebirth from the darkness
be a pumice for the soul.

19
00:02:57,458 --> 00:03:00,125
Now, let us hope
that the lesson took.

20
00:03:00,208 --> 00:03:01,833
Tell all the girls
to stay back...

21
00:03:01,916 --> 00:03:03,333
He's definitely here for them.

22
00:03:03,416 --> 00:03:04,791
I find that sexist!

23
00:03:04,875 --> 00:03:06,791
Give it a rest already...?!

24
00:03:06,875 --> 00:03:08,083
He's trying to help you!

25
00:03:11,583 --> 00:03:13,125
We've got him outnumbered...

26
00:03:13,208 --> 00:03:15,625
Remember your training
and give him hell...

27
00:03:15,708 --> 00:03:17,250
Follow my lead!

28
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:22,791
What?

29
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:26,875
Donar, no!

30
00:03:26,958 --> 00:03:28,250
Get him!

31
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:31,791
Wait...! Yeah;
I think I got this guys!

32
00:03:31,875 --> 00:03:33,166
[AMATA]
Andy...!

33
00:03:41,958 --> 00:03:43,000
That rocked!

34
00:03:43,083 --> 00:03:45,000
No kidding,
talk about a hole in one!

35
00:03:45,541 --> 00:03:47,708
You still want me to stay back?!

36
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:53,791
[AMATA]
Two peas in a pod.

37
00:03:53,875 --> 00:03:55,916
[MIKONO]
Or two peas in a hole.

38
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,416
[CAYENNE]
Groan.

39
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:03,458
[AMATA]
Stupid reversal power!

40
00:04:03,541 --> 00:04:04,375
What power?

41
00:04:04,458 --> 00:04:05,583
That's what he does...!

42
00:04:05,666 --> 00:04:07,500
He reverses whatever
you throw at him!

43
00:04:07,583 --> 00:04:10,583
This your idea of a joke?

44
00:04:12,125 --> 00:04:14,625
Put her down!
Put her down or I will kill you!

45
00:04:14,708 --> 00:04:17,583
Ugh... Smells like
the rest of you losers.

46
00:04:22,125 --> 00:04:24,166
Where's my rancid bitch?!

47
00:04:25,916 --> 00:04:28,458
Why pick me...?
I don't understand.

48
00:04:30,583 --> 00:04:31,750
Defend Mikono!

49
00:04:31,833 --> 00:04:34,416
I won't let him
touch her... It's okay!

50
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,083
Let's get you outta here!

51
00:04:36,166 --> 00:04:37,708
Malloy!

52
00:04:40,208 --> 00:04:41,416
Come back!

53
00:04:44,791 --> 00:04:45,791
Nice try...

54
00:04:45,875 --> 00:04:48,416
But no one comes
'tween me and my wench.

55
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,125
That happens to
be my little sister

56
00:04:50,208 --> 00:04:52,000
you're talkin' about, douchebag!

57
00:05:00,458 --> 00:05:01,708
What is this?

58
00:05:03,875 --> 00:05:06,000
He reverses damage
he takes too?!

59
00:05:11,041 --> 00:05:12,458
[KAGURA]
You're mine!

60
00:05:14,958 --> 00:05:16,166
[ZESSICA]
Those eyes.

61
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:18,791
They burn straight
through to what he wants.

62
00:05:34,291 --> 00:05:35,666
[violin music]

63
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:36,958
Augh! Ugh!

64
00:05:37,041 --> 00:05:41,375
[violin music]

65
00:05:41,458 --> 00:05:44,208
[KAGURA]
That noise... Not you again!

66
00:05:48,041 --> 00:05:49,833
Cut that shit out!

67
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:53,208
But it's lively arabesque
in homage to you.

68
00:05:54,791 --> 00:05:56,666
Bastard... Knock it off!

69
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,416
[SHRADE]
Catch the hook yet...?

70
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:03,916
It's a clever inversion
of your own bristly theme.

71
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:09,208
[KAGURA]
Stay the hell out of my way!

72
00:06:09,291 --> 00:06:15,333
She's mine...! You hear me?
The bitch belongs to me!

73
00:06:29,041 --> 00:06:31,708
[SHRADE] He thwarted the
melody in single beat.

74
00:06:33,708 --> 00:06:36,291
He's a beast but he's good...

75
00:06:36,375 --> 00:06:38,166
More than good.

76
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:40,041
This could get interesting.

77
00:06:46,875 --> 00:06:48,666
So this freak's into Mikono?

78
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:50,041
Uh, obviously, why else would

79
00:06:50,125 --> 00:06:52,208
a guy chase a girl
around like that...?

80
00:06:52,291 --> 00:06:54,291
Wow... I'd like that problem!

81
00:06:54,375 --> 00:06:56,625
It's strange... Why do this?

82
00:06:58,541 --> 00:06:59,875
[MALLOY]
Is that a wolf?

83
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:03,666
[MALLOY]
Oh no! It's him!

84
00:07:11,791 --> 00:07:12,958
Whoa!

85
00:07:13,041 --> 00:07:15,250
Oh, hell no! Reversal!

86
00:08:00,291 --> 00:08:02,958
[DONAR] Just got word from
Malloy. The dog guy...

87
00:08:03,041 --> 00:08:04,333
He kidnapped Mikono

88
00:08:04,416 --> 00:08:05,916
and he's hiding
somewhere in the city.

89
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,500
You and your team
sweep the area,

90
00:08:07,583 --> 00:08:08,625
we'll cover from above.

91
00:08:08,708 --> 00:08:10,125
Roger that, sir.

92
00:08:27,625 --> 00:08:28,750
We better split up...!

93
00:08:28,833 --> 00:08:30,291
You guys go that way.

94
00:08:30,375 --> 00:08:33,000
Wait...! Don't forget me!

95
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,916
[MIKONO]
Amata. Is that you?

96
00:09:05,625 --> 00:09:08,125
Easy now... You almost fell.

97
00:09:46,875 --> 00:09:48,750
Come on, relax...

98
00:09:48,833 --> 00:09:51,250
There's no reason
for you to be afraid.

99
00:09:51,333 --> 00:09:55,291
You're safe in my arms...
This is how you die.

100
00:10:01,333 --> 00:10:03,000
Mikono!

101
00:10:05,083 --> 00:10:08,333
[KAGURA] I got her... Hey!
The bitch is in the bag!

102
00:10:08,416 --> 00:10:11,416
You hearin' me?
Open the damn gate and hurry!

103
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:19,375
Hello, anyone there?

104
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:22,666
Not sure I'm even
using this right...

105
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:26,125
[KAGURA]
Hello, can you hear me...?

106
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:27,291
I got what I came for...

107
00:10:27,375 --> 00:10:29,750
Get me back home... Damn it...!

108
00:10:29,833 --> 00:10:31,666
If you can hear me, respond...!

109
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:34,333
Hey! Don't leave me here!

110
00:10:47,291 --> 00:10:48,875
Mikono...!

111
00:10:52,208 --> 00:10:53,250
 Amata!

112
00:10:58,041 --> 00:10:59,500
[ZESSICA]
You have to calm down...

113
00:10:59,583 --> 00:11:01,083
I'm sure Mikono's fine.

114
00:11:01,166 --> 00:11:02,875
How the hell do you know?!

115
00:11:02,958 --> 00:11:06,875
Cause I just know...
Trust me, okay?

116
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:09,708
I do... But still...

117
00:11:10,458 --> 00:11:11,583
It may be hard to believe,

118
00:11:11,666 --> 00:11:14,291
but there's no
way he'll hurt her...

119
00:11:14,375 --> 00:11:15,541
She's gonna be fine.

120
00:11:15,625 --> 00:11:17,625
And what exactly
makes you think that?

121
00:11:17,708 --> 00:11:19,875
Because... Ugh!

122
00:11:19,958 --> 00:11:23,541
It's like, it's written in the
stars or whatever, okay...?

123
00:11:25,291 --> 00:11:30,250
I'm sorry... The two of you
are just not meant to be.

124
00:11:49,916 --> 00:11:54,041
 Your scent... It's so pungent.

125
00:11:55,125 --> 00:11:56,583
You're insane...

126
00:11:56,666 --> 00:11:59,833
But it doesn't mean
you have to be cruel!

127
00:11:59,916 --> 00:12:03,000
If I'm cruel,
it's because of you...

128
00:12:03,083 --> 00:12:05,291
You did this to me.

129
00:12:05,375 --> 00:12:07,666
C'mon... What could I have done

130
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:10,041
to you that was so bad?

131
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,916
You let a universe
come between us.

132
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,125
But that's... Yeah fine...

133
00:12:16,208 --> 00:12:18,666
Just stop talking
and get this over with!

134
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:20,541
Shut up!

135
00:12:20,625 --> 00:12:22,291
Sorry.

136
00:12:23,708 --> 00:12:27,500
No... I can't...
It's not right...

137
00:12:27,583 --> 00:12:29,291
Not in a place like this.

138
00:12:29,375 --> 00:12:31,750
Wait... How come?

139
00:12:42,875 --> 00:12:44,291
Please don't!

140
00:12:45,541 --> 00:12:47,708
If that's what you want,
have it your way...

141
00:12:47,791 --> 00:12:49,333
I'll stop.

142
00:12:50,541 --> 00:12:53,500
That's not stopping...! Ugh!

143
00:12:57,875 --> 00:13:00,083
Ah, you want some of this?

144
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:14,916
Words can't
describe--how much I...

145
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,583
I... hate you...

146
00:13:19,291 --> 00:13:23,916
[MIKONO]
Wait, he's... He's backward...

147
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,500
Don't believe what I say...

148
00:13:25,583 --> 00:13:27,416
It's all crap.

149
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:37,291
[MIKONO]
His eyes... They're familiar...

150
00:13:37,375 --> 00:13:41,333
But why...? Why do
I recognize them?

151
00:13:44,125 --> 00:13:45,666
[KAGURA]
I finally found you.

152
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:46,750
[MIKONO]
What?

153
00:13:46,833 --> 00:13:48,958
[KAGURA]
Come with me, Silvie... Please.

154
00:13:49,041 --> 00:13:50,708
I don't understand...

155
00:13:50,791 --> 00:13:54,416
You've called me that
name before... Who is she?

156
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:59,125
Silvie and Apollon...
That's the story of us.

157
00:14:00,333 --> 00:14:02,625
[MIKAGE] It began beneath
the Tree of Life...

158
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:06,583
At the birth of all things,
the Great Descent.

159
00:14:06,666 --> 00:14:08,833
When spirit fell to matter...

160
00:14:08,916 --> 00:14:11,750
the Tree of Life was the
fulcrum point of reality...

161
00:14:11,833 --> 00:14:14,500
the axis mundi around which
even the smallest creature

162
00:14:14,583 --> 00:14:17,291
orbited in perfect harmony.

163
00:14:17,375 --> 00:14:19,000
War boiled 'twixt the angels

164
00:14:19,083 --> 00:14:20,875
and their gelded kin...

165
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:22,541
Solar Wing awakened;

166
00:14:22,625 --> 00:14:23,833
pollinated the Tree so as

167
00:14:23,916 --> 00:14:26,958
to protect the fragile
balance of existence.

168
00:14:27,041 --> 00:14:31,250
But. The flowers wilted
before they could bear fruit...

169
00:14:31,333 --> 00:14:33,708
Harmony became chaos.

170
00:14:33,791 --> 00:14:37,166
[ZESSICA] Eventually the world
would suffer the consequences,

171
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:40,375
and the continuation of
life would become impossible.

172
00:14:40,458 --> 00:14:42,916
So Apollon and Silvie
sacrificed their love...

173
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,875
Gave it all up for
the Tree of Life...

174
00:14:44,958 --> 00:14:47,083
Because they knew
they had to protect it.

175
00:14:47,166 --> 00:14:49,500
And because she was
willing to hold out for him.

176
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,166
[MIKONO]
I'm okay to wait,

177
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:54,750
long as you don't mind
me just hanging out...

178
00:14:54,833 --> 00:14:58,208
"For twelve-thousand years,
if I must," or whatever.

179
00:14:59,708 --> 00:15:02,416
[KAGURA] I'll be waiting
for you too, Silvie.

180
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:07,166
If it takes centuries--if
it takes eons--so be it.

181
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:09,958
Wow... That's what Apollon said.

182
00:15:10,041 --> 00:15:14,125
[KAGURA]
Yeah... That's me... I'm him.

183
00:15:14,708 --> 00:15:19,416
[MIKONO]
Is that true...? You're Apollon?

184
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,083
And that makes you...

185
00:15:21,166 --> 00:15:23,458
But that can't be.

186
00:15:23,541 --> 00:15:27,333
[AMATA] Hold on. So you're
saying Mikono is Silvie?

187
00:15:27,416 --> 00:15:29,000
That's impossible...!

188
00:15:29,083 --> 00:15:31,541
How could you think
something like that?!

189
00:15:31,625 --> 00:15:32,791
[ZESSICA]
'Cause I saw it.

190
00:15:32,875 --> 00:15:34,333
[AMATA]
What?

191
00:15:38,208 --> 00:15:39,708
It's related to Cayenne's vision

192
00:15:39,791 --> 00:15:42,375
of the whole
funeral-slash-wedding thing...

193
00:15:42,458 --> 00:15:43,375
You saw it, too.

194
00:15:43,458 --> 00:15:44,708
What difference does it make,

195
00:15:44,791 --> 00:15:46,791
Apollon and Silvie are
just a stupid fairy tale,

196
00:15:46,875 --> 00:15:48,958
why should I even give a damn?!

197
00:15:49,041 --> 00:15:50,916
Because it's the truth.

198
00:15:51,958 --> 00:15:52,958
And I'm ashamed to say,

199
00:15:53,041 --> 00:15:55,500
I was happy when I found out...

200
00:15:55,583 --> 00:15:57,416
If Mikono's destiny is with him,

201
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:59,750
that means you're free
to date around, y'know...?

202
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:02,666
Meaning we could...
maybe have a chance.

203
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,500
Zessica... What are you saying?

204
00:16:09,916 --> 00:16:11,208
[AMATA]
A butterfly.

205
00:16:11,625 --> 00:16:13,375
[ZESSICA]
Random.

206
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:26,833
[MIKONO] No! That's
impossible...! I can't be her!

207
00:16:28,541 --> 00:16:30,791
You-- you're wrong!
I am not Sil--!

208
00:16:31,666 --> 00:16:32,750
[KAGURA]
Silvie!

209
00:16:38,125 --> 00:16:41,250
You see that...? It's her!

210
00:16:42,083 --> 00:16:43,375
[ZESSICA]
Amata!

211
00:16:51,166 --> 00:16:52,958
Please don't scare me like that.

212
00:16:54,291 --> 00:16:55,666
[AMATA]
Mikono!

213
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:00,500
[AMATA]
Mikono!

214
00:17:01,083 --> 00:17:02,500
He came for me!

215
00:17:02,583 --> 00:17:04,375
That jackass again?

216
00:17:09,291 --> 00:17:10,458
Amata!

217
00:17:12,625 --> 00:17:15,625
Give up, already...! She's mine!

218
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:21,833
Amata!

219
00:17:25,625 --> 00:17:26,541
[ZESSICA]
You all right?!

220
00:17:26,625 --> 00:17:27,583
[AMATA]
Yeah, I'm fine...

221
00:17:27,666 --> 00:17:28,416
Don't worry...

222
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,291
I finally did it, Zessica!

223
00:17:30,375 --> 00:17:31,500
[ZESSICA]
Did what?

224
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:33,625
The special training.

225
00:17:33,708 --> 00:17:38,375
I was able to do it... I just
resisted his power. Wait.

226
00:17:42,041 --> 00:17:43,083
[AMATA]
Stay back...

227
00:17:43,166 --> 00:17:45,125
Here... He... Comes.

228
00:17:45,208 --> 00:17:47,750
I'll do my best to keep
him away from Mikono...

229
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:49,500
You find Cayenne!

230
00:17:51,833 --> 00:17:54,333
Amata... Always the hero.

231
00:18:06,041 --> 00:18:08,416
[YUNOHA]
Mikono! She's on that ledge!

232
00:18:28,375 --> 00:18:29,625
[ZESSICA]
Amata!

233
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:31,333
Cayenne's coming to help you...!

234
00:18:31,416 --> 00:18:33,166
Get out of there right now!

235
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:34,791
 No, not yet...

236
00:18:34,875 --> 00:18:36,000
I have to keep him distracted

237
00:18:36,083 --> 00:18:38,208
so Mikono has a chance
to get out of there!

238
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:40,875
Just be careful.

239
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:48,166
Eat this...! Bastard!

240
00:19:04,083 --> 00:19:05,458
Damn.

241
00:19:14,041 --> 00:19:15,041
[KAGURA]
Kill you...!

242
00:19:15,125 --> 00:19:18,458
I'll kill you!
Do you hear me, punk?!

243
00:19:18,541 --> 00:19:20,416
You're a dead man!

244
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:30,375
This is it...

245
00:19:30,458 --> 00:19:32,000
I'm gonna die here.

246
00:19:32,541 --> 00:19:35,250
So be it, then.

247
00:19:35,333 --> 00:19:37,958
I don't want to be
abandoned ever again...

248
00:19:38,041 --> 00:19:40,291
I don't want to be born again...

249
00:19:40,375 --> 00:19:43,125
It's... better down here.

250
00:19:45,041 --> 00:19:46,375
[FUDO]
Amata Sora...

251
00:19:46,458 --> 00:19:48,166
Be not afraid.

252
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:49,958
Darkness need no longer be

253
00:19:50,041 --> 00:19:52,041
a place of panic and pain,

254
00:19:52,125 --> 00:19:54,750
nor of lassitude and loneliness.

255
00:19:54,833 --> 00:19:57,083
Rid yourself of
all attachments...

256
00:19:57,166 --> 00:19:58,875
Trade them for understanding.

257
00:20:00,708 --> 00:20:03,791
[AMATA] Yeah... No, you're
absolutely right...

258
00:20:03,875 --> 00:20:06,166
I have to free myself
from the past;

259
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:08,416
break the cycle of betrayal.

260
00:20:19,666 --> 00:20:21,750
Moron doesn't
know when to quit...

261
00:20:21,833 --> 00:20:24,125
Stop...! Re-ver-sal!

262
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:27,000
What the--hell?!

263
00:20:27,083 --> 00:20:28,958
Why isn't my power working?!

264
00:20:29,041 --> 00:20:30,875
[FUDO]
Forgo your bonds...

265
00:20:30,958 --> 00:20:34,416
And nothing will lead
you astray again!

266
00:20:40,625 --> 00:20:42,416
No!

267
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:44,125
[gunshot bang]

268
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:51,416
[AMATA]
Cayenne!

269
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:52,708
[CAYENNE]
You're lucky I made it.

270
00:20:52,791 --> 00:20:54,375
I'm gonna finish him off...

271
00:20:54,458 --> 00:20:56,541
Time to put an end
to this nonsense!

272
00:21:07,833 --> 00:21:09,958
Wha--?! Amata!
Take him out! right now!

273
00:21:18,333 --> 00:21:19,500
[CAYENNE]
What are you waiting for?!

274
00:21:19,583 --> 00:21:22,458
Shoot him... You know
he'd do the same to you!

275
00:21:29,125 --> 00:21:30,291
[MIKONO]
Stop this!

276
00:21:30,375 --> 00:21:32,666
Amata, please don't shoot him!

277
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:34,625
Mikono?!

278
00:21:34,708 --> 00:21:35,958
Mikono.

279
00:21:38,416 --> 00:21:40,041
What the hell?

280
00:21:40,125 --> 00:21:41,833
Please, I'm begging you.

281
00:21:41,916 --> 00:21:47,375
Don't do this... Don't shoot
him. Please let him live!

282
00:21:49,458 --> 00:21:51,125
That's what you want?

283
00:22:28,291 --> 00:22:30,875
[AMATA]
Mikono... Why?

284
00:22:36,958 --> 00:22:40,375
[MIKAGE]
Fly. Winged sigil of rebirth...

285
00:22:40,458 --> 00:22:45,041
Harbinger of forbidden
love's return. Soar.

286
00:22:45,125 --> 00:22:50,000
Let death end untold
millennia of despair!

287
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:25,625
[KAGURA]
I can't control myself...

288
00:24:25,708 --> 00:24:27,375
The twelve thousand
year-old stench

289
00:24:27,458 --> 00:24:30,000
of fate is rising to
the surface again...

290
00:24:30,083 --> 00:24:33,458
Let it wash over you,
my beloved Silvie...

291
00:24:33,541 --> 00:24:35,958
Next time, "Soul's Confession."
