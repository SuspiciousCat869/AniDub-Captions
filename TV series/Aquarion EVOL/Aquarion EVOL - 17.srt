00:09:34,041 --> 00:09:35,958
But in ancient Greece,

166
00:09:36,041 --> 00:09:38,208
Mix would've lived in a temple.

167
00:09:38,291 --> 00:09:41,041
Yeah... Right next to Mikono...

168
00:09:41,125 --> 00:09:43,208
Just look at her...

169
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:46,875
[ANDY]
Son of a bitch!

170
00:09:46,958 --> 00:09:48,833
My wild oats are screaming!

171
00:09:48,916 --> 00:09:50,250
Screw it...!

172
00:09:50,333 --> 00:09:52,083
Opportunity's knockin'
and I'm startin' the tractor!

173
00:09:52,166 --> 00:09:54,666
Service... Booya!

174
00:10:00,208 --> 00:10:01,791
Oh, Andy!

175
00:10:06,208 --> 00:10:07,500
Ow, easy...!

176
00:10:07,583 --> 00:10:11,250
[MIX]
Yeah, yeah. Don't be a baby.

177
00:10:11,333 --> 00:10:13,708
Nice bedside manner
you got there, doc...

178
00:10:13,791 --> 00:10:15,500
At least a smack on
the head is nothing

179
00:10:15,583 --> 00:10:17,750
compared to cupid's
arrow in your chest.

180
00:10:17,833 --> 00:10:19,500
Wait, you got hit in the chest?

181
00:10:19,583 --> 00:10:22,375
No, I'm just...
Being metaphorical.

182
00:10:22,458 --> 00:10:23,791
You were hit hard...

183
00:10:23,875 --> 00:10:26,083
I recommend you play it safe

184
00:10:26,166 --> 00:10:28,041
and lie down for a bit.

185
00:10:29,833 --> 00:10:31,250
Mix, wait!

186
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:35,500
The bedside manner crack...

187
00:10:35,583 --> 00:10:37,875
I didn't really mean it.

188
00:10:37,958 --> 00:10:42,875
Fact is... You're pretty
damn good at this.

189
00:10:53,666 --> 00:10:54,833
[MALLOY]
Seriously.

190
00:10:54,916 --> 00:10:58,208
She doin' bloodwork...?
What's takin' so long?

191
00:10:58,291 --> 00:11:00,000
We should bring 'em
a couple of these.

192
00:11:00,083 --> 00:11:01,833
Actually...
Might not be a bad idea

193
00:11:01,916 --> 00:11:04,625
to give 'em a little
more time to themselves.

194
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:06,375
Speaking of which,

195
00:11:06,458 --> 00:11:07,625
where the hell is Mikono?

196
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:08,625
Not sure...

197
00:11:08,708 --> 00:11:10,750
Where's Zessica,
for that matter?

198
00:11:19,541 --> 00:11:21,250
I am such an idiot.

199
00:11:24,125 --> 00:11:25,458
What the...?

200
00:11:26,041 --> 00:11:27,041
[MIKONO]
You don't mind

201
00:11:27,125 --> 00:11:29,166
if I come be antisocial
with you, right?

202
00:11:32,416 --> 00:11:34,916
I guess great minds
think alike, huh?

203
00:11:37,458 --> 00:11:39,541
Here you go...
So you don't freeze.

204
00:11:40,708 --> 00:11:44,166
[ANDY] Listen, I...
I realize you're gung ho

205
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:46,750
about love being
a sin and all...

206
00:11:46,833 --> 00:11:49,500
But if I don't just...
say what I've gotta say,

207
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:51,416
I'm never gonna forgive myself.

208
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:52,750
Look,...

209
00:11:52,833 --> 00:11:54,458
whatever you're talking
about, maybe this isn't--

210
00:12:03,208 --> 00:12:04,958
Um... Andy?

211
00:12:05,041 --> 00:12:06,000
Listen...

212
00:12:06,083 --> 00:12:07,083
When all this business

213
00:12:07,166 --> 00:12:09,291
with the Abductors
is done... Man...

214
00:12:09,375 --> 00:12:11,208
I might as well be signing
my own death warrant,

215
00:12:11,291 --> 00:12:13,583
saying this to you
of all people...

216
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:15,291
You know what: who cares...?!

217
00:12:15,375 --> 00:12:17,000
When we've driven
the last of 'em back...

218
00:12:17,083 --> 00:12:20,958
I want... I want
me and you to be...

219
00:12:21,041 --> 00:12:23,291
To be... Son of a bitch...

220
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:24,875
[ANDY]
Say it, dumbass...!

221
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:26,041
You've got this!

222
00:12:26,125 --> 00:12:27,583
Tell her there's
a hole in her heart;

223
00:12:27,666 --> 00:12:29,833
tell her you know you're the
only man who can fill it,

224
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:32,666
and that your life won't
mean squat till you do!

225
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:35,125
Please... Andy...

226
00:12:35,208 --> 00:12:36,458
[ANDY]
Mix!

227
00:12:36,541 --> 00:12:38,833
Come on...!
Spit it the hell out...!

228
00:12:38,916 --> 00:12:40,958
She needs to hear you say it!

229
00:12:41,041 --> 00:12:43,875
You need to hear
yourself saying it!

230
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:45,625
Mix!

231
00:12:45,708 --> 00:12:47,000
Yes?!

232
00:12:47,083 --> 00:12:48,791
Please let me...

233
00:12:48,875 --> 00:12:50,541
Lemme fill your hole!

234
00:12:54,083 --> 00:12:54,958
Do what?

235
00:12:55,041 --> 00:12:55,708
Please!

236
00:12:55,791 --> 00:12:56,958
I'm begging you...!

237
00:12:57,041 --> 00:12:58,458
Let me--

238
00:13:00,125 --> 00:13:00,833
Oh shit!

239
00:13:00,916 --> 00:13:02,416
Uhhh... Not what I meant!

240
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:05,416
I was talking about the hole in
your heart, I swear on my life!

241
00:13:08,916 --> 00:13:11,625
[SAZANKA] Oh no, sounds
like trouble in paradise...

242
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:14,916
You're a... pig!!!

243
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:20,791
The one in your... heart.

244
00:13:20,875 --> 00:13:22,708
[MIKONO] Okay, truth:
you'll think it's dumb,

245
00:13:22,791 --> 00:13:23,708
but I've envied you

246
00:13:23,791 --> 00:13:25,833
since my first day
at the Academy.

247
00:13:25,916 --> 00:13:26,875
[ZESSICA]
What?

248
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:29,000
I mean, c'mon: look at you...

249
00:13:29,083 --> 00:13:31,791
You always let everyone
know where they stand.

250
00:13:32,166 --> 00:13:33,250
I could never have been

251
00:13:33,333 --> 00:13:35,833
as straightforward
with Amata as you were.

252
00:13:35,916 --> 00:13:38,000
I'm too self-conscious.

253
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:38,916
Just so you know,

254
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,208
I bottled it up a long time

255
00:13:40,291 --> 00:13:42,375
before I finally
came out with it.

256
00:13:42,458 --> 00:13:45,833
You shouldn't envy me...

257
00:13:45,916 --> 00:13:47,875
Hell, take a look at yourself.

258
00:13:47,958 --> 00:13:49,458
You're always
such a sweetheart...

259
00:13:49,541 --> 00:13:50,750
I mean it...

260
00:13:50,833 --> 00:13:52,958
A guy sees a girl like you
and says to himself:

261
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:54,833
there's one for the long haul.

262
00:13:54,916 --> 00:13:56,750
Whatever...!
And I suppose you're not?

263
00:13:56,833 --> 00:13:59,291
Guys fall all over themselves
trying to get to you!

264
00:14:01,916 --> 00:14:04,000
I might be the one they
drool over for a while,

265
00:14:04,083 --> 00:14:05,125
but you're the one they wind up

266
00:14:05,208 --> 00:14:06,791
moving heaven and earth for.

267
00:14:06,875 --> 00:14:09,083
See... You just bring
that quality out

268
00:14:09,166 --> 00:14:11,833
in guys--in all of us, really.

269
00:14:12,833 --> 00:14:14,333
Zessica...

270
00:14:16,666 --> 00:14:19,416
What the--?!

271
00:14:20,041 --> 00:14:21,125
[MIKONO]
That's not good.

272
00:14:27,083 --> 00:14:29,375
Oh, no...! A Dimension Gate!

273
00:14:29,458 --> 00:14:31,833
Amata...! Help me get
the vectors back online!

274
00:14:31,916 --> 00:14:33,208
Right, let's go!

275
00:14:33,291 --> 00:14:34,041
Why would the Abductors

276
00:14:34,125 --> 00:14:37,125
come out this far?! Andy!

277
00:14:39,125 --> 00:14:41,125
Way to go, genius.

278
00:14:41,208 --> 00:14:44,041
Way to piss all over
your shot at love.

279
00:14:44,125 --> 00:14:46,916
Stupid. Freaking. Moron...

280
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,291
Do everyone a favor: just
crawl into a hole and die.

281
00:14:59,375 --> 00:15:00,791
I've got a confirmed
Dimension Gate

282
00:15:00,875 --> 00:15:03,333
opening in outlier quadrant ANH!

283
00:15:03,416 --> 00:15:04,958
[DONAR]
Why is it a morgue in here?

284
00:15:05,041 --> 00:15:06,541
Where the hell is everyone...?!

285
00:15:06,625 --> 00:15:08,500
Somebody explain this, now!

286
00:15:08,583 --> 00:15:10,208
[CREA]
It's all right, Commander Donar.

287
00:15:10,291 --> 00:15:12,958
[DONAR] Really? Because to
me this looks like

288
00:15:13,041 --> 00:15:15,333
the exact opposite
of "all right!"

289
00:15:31,958 --> 00:15:33,625
[MIKONO]
What kind of Abductor is that?!

290
00:15:33,708 --> 00:15:35,541
[ZESSICA]
Let's not wait n' find out!

291
00:15:36,333 --> 00:15:37,916
Andy!

292
00:15:41,458 --> 00:15:42,875
Andy! What are you doing...?!

293
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:44,000
Snap out of it...!

294
00:15:44,083 --> 00:15:46,625
This is not the
time or the place!

295
00:15:46,708 --> 00:15:47,958
Yeah, I know...

296
00:15:48,041 --> 00:15:50,916
It's not the time or place
and it's never gonna be.

297
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
What?

298
00:15:59,958 --> 00:16:03,208
Deep Winter Merge...
Go...! Aquarion!

299
00:16:09,875 --> 00:16:12,625
[CAYENNE]
Aquarion... Gepard!

300
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:17,291
[CAYENNE]
Here's the plan:

301
00:16:17,375 --> 00:16:19,041
we'll take out the freak show...

302
00:16:19,125 --> 00:16:21,916
Shrade,... you take care
of everyone on the ground.

303
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,666
Right... I'm on it.

304
00:16:37,041 --> 00:16:38,041
So cold.

305
00:16:38,125 --> 00:16:39,416
Not that any of us is made

306
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:41,250
for this weather,
but this is balls.

307
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:42,875
I want everybody to take shelter

308
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:44,500
in the hole Andy's dug...

309
00:16:44,583 --> 00:16:46,916
At the very least,
we'll be out of this wind.

310
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,208
Do you think this blizzard

311
00:16:49,291 --> 00:16:51,000
is the Abductor's doing?

312
00:16:53,958 --> 00:16:55,458
We're gonna be fine.

313
00:16:55,541 --> 00:16:58,666
Trust me... Amata
won't let us freeze.

314
00:17:07,125 --> 00:17:10,291
Damn it! We need
our Element Armor!

315
00:17:10,375 --> 00:17:12,125
I can't get the heat to come on!

316
00:17:12,208 --> 00:17:14,750
Oh man... I can't take this.

317
00:17:25,958 --> 00:17:27,000
I'm glad we're out of the wind,

318
00:17:27,083 --> 00:17:28,958
but how far down's
this thing go?

319
00:17:29,041 --> 00:17:30,583
I don't like this...

320
00:17:31,791 --> 00:17:33,041
[MIX]
Andy...

321
00:17:34,208 --> 00:17:37,500
[ANDY] It's over...
Goodbye cruel world.

322
00:17:38,208 --> 00:17:41,291
Andy's aura, sir...!
It's about to go flatline!

323
00:17:41,875 --> 00:17:44,666
Excellent timing. Andy...!

324
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:46,708
You are hitting
rock bottom, my boy!

325
00:17:46,791 --> 00:17:49,833
Go! Go one further!

00:18:00,708 --> 00:18:02,125
[ANDY]
'Kay where am I...?

327
00:18:20,375 --> 00:18:24,833
Bravo. Music so sublime,
the earth weeps.

328
00:18:28,041 --> 00:18:29,625
[DONAR]
What the hell...?

329
00:18:30,166 --> 00:18:32,083
[CREA]
A proud harvest, I'd say.

330
00:18:32,166 --> 00:18:34,875
[FUDO] The seed reaches ever
upward through the clay...

331
00:18:34,958 --> 00:18:38,958
Its fruit blooms, falls,
and roots in richer soil...

332
00:18:39,041 --> 00:18:41,166
Thus the cycle
of life rolls on...

333
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:43,125
Thus the earth thrives!

334
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,458
Damn...! It's so cold!

335
00:18:49,666 --> 00:18:50,375
Oh crap...!

336
00:18:50,458 --> 00:18:52,041
Please not a flood!

337
00:18:54,083 --> 00:18:55,708
Hey, this feels nice.

338
00:18:56,083 --> 00:18:57,458
Why does it smell
like sulphur...?

339
00:18:57,541 --> 00:19:00,375
Is this from a hot spring
or somethin'...? Whoa!

340
00:19:01,375 --> 00:19:02,166
What the...?!

341
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:04,375
Ah...! Precious warmth!

342
00:19:04,458 --> 00:19:07,833
Sorry! My bad!

343
00:19:08,291 --> 00:19:09,125
Zessica?!

344
00:19:09,208 --> 00:19:11,083
 And Mikono...?

345
00:19:11,166 --> 00:19:12,666
Amata?

346
00:19:19,291 --> 00:19:24,125
Coed Bathhouse Merge...!
Go...! Aquarion!

347
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:30,625
I... I'm surging upward!

348
00:19:30,708 --> 00:19:32,333
Up through the soil!

349
00:19:32,416 --> 00:19:34,666
The sun's kissing my face!

350
00:19:37,791 --> 00:19:40,833
[AMATA]
Aquarion Evol!

351
00:19:45,708 --> 00:19:48,083
[SUOMI] The ancient alchemists
wrote in secret scriptures,

352
00:19:48,166 --> 00:19:50,083
often in peril of
their own lives,

353
00:19:50,166 --> 00:19:52,416
that an aggregate
of anima and animus,

354
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:53,625
male and female,

355
00:19:53,708 --> 00:19:56,375
yielded spiritual
riches beyond compare.

356
00:19:56,458 --> 00:19:58,041
The Elements are forging

357
00:19:58,125 --> 00:19:59,000
just such a compound;

358
00:19:59,083 --> 00:20:01,666
Aquarion is their crucible.

359
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:04,833
Well done...
High Commander Fudo,

360
00:20:04,916 --> 00:20:07,208
you are a certifiable genius!

361
00:20:11,875 --> 00:20:13,333
I think I get the bath part...

362
00:20:13,416 --> 00:20:15,458
But explain the
metric ton of bananas.

363
00:20:15,541 --> 00:20:17,708
Time was, shamans
in tropical climates

364
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:19,833
brandished them as totems of
fertility.

365
00:20:19,916 --> 00:20:21,208
That they did...

366
00:20:21,291 --> 00:20:23,833
As mystics in harsher climes
told in their midrashim

367
00:20:23,916 --> 00:20:25,083
of the serpent tempting Eve

368
00:20:25,166 --> 00:20:26,875
with the selfsame bounty.

369
00:20:26,958 --> 00:20:28,500
Behold the fruit of Eden,

370
00:20:28,583 --> 00:20:31,083
ladies and gentlemen;
the light worshiper.

371
00:20:31,166 --> 00:20:34,333
As it ripens,
in unmitigated zeal

372
00:20:34,416 --> 00:20:37,625
for the gift of life,
it hails to the sun.

373
00:20:39,291 --> 00:20:41,000
[MIKONO]
This feels wonderful!

374
00:20:41,083 --> 00:20:44,083
[ZESSICA] Like light is
coursing through my body!

375
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,541
Warm it up!

376
00:20:55,083 --> 00:20:56,916
[DONAR]
What is that?!

377
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,166
Heh... The peel has been shed.

378
00:21:12,208 --> 00:21:16,125
[AMATA and ALL]
Cluster Infinity Punch!

379
00:21:22,375 --> 00:21:24,666
[ALL]
Break him!

380
00:21:31,083 --> 00:21:32,041
Good job!

381
00:21:35,708 --> 00:21:37,166
[ANDY]
 I meant... I meant...

382
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:39,041
the hole in your heart...

383
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:43,166
[MIKAGE] A fragment of
Solar Wing laid bare...

384
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:46,250
Yet only a fragment.

385
00:21:46,333 --> 00:21:50,166
Where, I wonder,
have you buried the rest?

386
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:53,500
[FUDO]
Have as many totems of fertility

387
00:21:53,583 --> 00:21:56,000
as your wounded heart can stand.

388
00:21:56,083 --> 00:21:59,666
Alas... They are totems only.

389
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,958
[ZESSICA]
What's up, gingersnap?

390
00:22:11,041 --> 00:22:11,916
Oh, hey!

391
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:16,708
[AMATA]
Whoa... What's with the...?

392
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:19,250
[EI]
Oh wow... What are you wearing?

393
00:22:19,333 --> 00:22:21,000
[SAZANKA]
Do you feel all right?

394
00:22:21,083 --> 00:22:22,291
[ZESSICA]
Mmm...

395
00:22:22,375 --> 00:22:25,583
I just figured it was,
time for a change.

396
00:22:25,666 --> 00:22:28,416
Oh, yeah... while
I'm thinkin' 'bout it...

397
00:22:32,583 --> 00:22:33,750
Your man...?

398
00:22:33,833 --> 00:22:35,666
Totally turned me down.

399
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:36,916
Which is what we want...

400
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,125
Can't run the risk of Aquarion

401
00:22:38,208 --> 00:22:40,708
going berserk on us, right...?

402
00:22:40,791 --> 00:22:42,583
Truth is, it's a hard world...

403
00:22:42,666 --> 00:22:43,708
It doesn't have much use

404
00:22:43,791 --> 00:22:45,916
for a heart that isn't broken.

405
00:24:23,041 --> 00:24:26,333
[ZESSICA] Sometimes, it's like
I don't know myself anymore.

406
00:24:26,416 --> 00:24:27,666
Ugh. That's lame.

407
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:29,791
I'm a smoldering-hot,
tough-as-nails badass!

408
00:24:29,875 --> 00:24:32,083
Always have been.
Always will be...

409
00:24:32,166 --> 00:24:35,208
Except... What does
that mean anymore???
