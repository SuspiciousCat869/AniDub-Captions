Special Training of the Grave!

165
00:11:08,083 --> 00:11:09,291
[CAYENNE]
You're insane, Commander!

166
00:11:09,375 --> 00:11:11,250
We just finished
burying our friends!

167
00:11:11,333 --> 00:11:13,000
[MIX] Everybody knows
I don't really care

168
00:11:13,083 --> 00:11:14,125
for any kind of hole...

169
00:11:14,208 --> 00:11:16,125
But buried in a grave,
I think not!

170
00:11:16,208 --> 00:11:17,041
Hey!

171
00:11:17,125 --> 00:11:18,083
Well this is...

172
00:11:18,166 --> 00:11:19,583
quite unorthodox.

173
00:11:19,666 --> 00:11:21,041
[MIKONO]
What is wrong with you?!

174
00:11:21,125 --> 00:11:21,625
Hold on...

175
00:11:21,708 --> 00:11:22,666
Mikono, what--?

176
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:24,541
How dare you say
such horrible things

177
00:11:24,625 --> 00:11:26,458
at a time like this?

178
00:11:30,291 --> 00:11:33,541
You've all led lives of
self-bestowed limitations.

179
00:11:34,958 --> 00:11:36,291
[FUDO]
As you sleep with the dead,

180
00:11:36,375 --> 00:11:39,916
the force of your
lives will expand.

181
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,333
Passion...

182
00:11:41,416 --> 00:11:45,500
Hatred... Attachment...
stubbornness... wickedness...

183
00:11:45,583 --> 00:11:48,875
Each of these primordial
drives are distractions...

184
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:51,375
Each distraction
a link in the chain

185
00:11:51,458 --> 00:11:53,000
shackling the human soul...

186
00:11:53,083 --> 00:11:55,625
thwarting us mid-flight.

187
00:11:55,708 --> 00:11:57,125
It is here, brave souls,

188
00:11:57,208 --> 00:11:59,958
that you must experience death.

189
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:04,833
[MALLOY]
It says "Death."

190
00:12:04,916 --> 00:12:07,375
[FUDO] You will journey to
the very edge of life...

191
00:12:07,458 --> 00:12:08,708
...then return...

192
00:12:09,916 --> 00:12:12,916
[FUDO] How will this false
demise enlighten you...?

193
00:12:13,708 --> 00:12:16,791
[FUDO] That secret you must
discover for yourselves!

194
00:12:18,125 --> 00:12:19,250
This sounds fascinating.

195
00:12:19,333 --> 00:12:20,708
Shrade, wait!

196
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:22,208
[SHRADE]
Why...?

197
00:12:22,291 --> 00:12:24,125
I'm already halfway
there myself...

198
00:12:24,208 --> 00:12:27,125
Death has long held me
in its cold stare,

199
00:12:27,208 --> 00:12:29,541
why not return the gaze?

200
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:33,500
Hold on! How can you--

201
00:12:33,583 --> 00:12:34,958
Yunoha!

202
00:12:35,625 --> 00:12:38,083
I want to be with him.

203
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:42,083
I want to be with Jin,
just for a little while.

204
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,875
Damn...

205
00:12:45,958 --> 00:12:48,166
As deep as this hole may be...

206
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:50,750
the war is gonna draw
us in even deeper.

207
00:12:53,125 --> 00:12:55,750
Filling a hole I just
busted my tail to make?

208
00:12:55,833 --> 00:12:58,250
Kinda feels like dying anyway.

209
00:13:02,125 --> 00:13:04,875
I will not be a
part of this farce!

210
00:13:04,958 --> 00:13:07,166
Then you are the exception.

211
00:13:07,958 --> 00:13:11,541
That damn eye can see through
everything, can't it...?

212
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:13,750
I hate it!

213
00:13:15,291 --> 00:13:17,791
Good... yes.

214
00:13:18,125 --> 00:13:19,291
Mikono...

215
00:13:19,375 --> 00:13:21,208
Amata!

216
00:13:39,583 --> 00:13:43,208
[AMATA]
It's dark... can't see at all...

217
00:13:43,291 --> 00:13:47,208
[ZESSICA] It's so quiet...
so absolutely quiet.

218
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,291
[SHRADE]
Wrong...

219
00:13:49,375 --> 00:13:51,208
There is sound...

220
00:13:51,291 --> 00:13:54,916
the sound of bugs
crawling on the earth.

221
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,500
The creatures squirming
through the dirt.

222
00:13:58,583 --> 00:14:00,083
[CAYENNE]
I can feel them...

223
00:14:00,166 --> 00:14:03,208
the worms creeping
at me, trying to get me...

224
00:14:03,291 --> 00:14:04,541
I'm going to...

225
00:14:04,625 --> 00:14:05,875
[MALLOY]
I'm...

226
00:14:05,958 --> 00:14:09,875
I'm going to turn into dust...
and break apart...

227
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:15,625
[SAZANKA] My body, it's...
it's rotting away!

228
00:14:16,208 --> 00:14:17,750
[YUNOHA]
Decaying...

229
00:14:17,833 --> 00:14:21,583
...becoming one with the
earth... becoming one...

230
00:14:21,666 --> 00:14:24,000
...with Jin again...

231
00:14:24,416 --> 00:14:27,875
[MIX] I'm scared...
Crumbling away... it's like...

232
00:14:27,958 --> 00:14:30,250
I'll never see the sun again!

233
00:14:30,333 --> 00:14:31,958
[ANDY]
Don't be afraid!

234
00:14:32,041 --> 00:14:33,916
[MIX]
The fear... too much.

235
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,416
[ANDY]
You can do it... just hold on!

236
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,125
I can't!

237
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:45,166
Oh, man...!

238
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:46,708
What happened?

239
00:14:46,791 --> 00:14:47,708
High Commander!

240
00:14:47,791 --> 00:14:48,875
[DONAR]
This is too much!

241
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:50,583
[FUDO]
Silence!

242
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:55,833
[MIKAGE] It seems the
Wingless Ones are preparing

243
00:14:55,916 --> 00:14:58,166
for their encroaching demise...

244
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:00,083
Charming.

245
00:15:00,166 --> 00:15:03,875
Kagura, my boy... would
you like to join them...?

246
00:15:03,958 --> 00:15:06,541
Take the same journey to Hades?

247
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:11,875
[MIKAGE]
Yes...

248
00:15:11,958 --> 00:15:15,125
I will weave you into the
fabric of eternal slumber...

249
00:15:15,208 --> 00:15:19,750
Rest in peace...
then raise hell.

250
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:24,958
[MIX]
I don't care how hard it gets...

251
00:15:25,041 --> 00:15:26,333
I won't leave...

252
00:15:26,416 --> 00:15:30,375
I just need to remember that
Andy dug this hole.

253
00:15:31,791 --> 00:15:33,916
[ANDY]
I did it all for you, babe.

254
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,041
[MIX] If I remember him,
I won't be afraid...

255
00:15:37,125 --> 00:15:39,333
it won't matter
if it's pitch black.

256
00:15:39,416 --> 00:15:42,083
[CAYENNE]
I can't see anything...

257
00:15:42,166 --> 00:15:45,166
Not even through my
Prophecy of Despair.

258
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:47,333
[ZESSICA]
Why...?

259
00:15:47,416 --> 00:15:50,333
Why did I have that vision?

260
00:15:51,666 --> 00:15:55,291
If Mikono really is
Sylvie reincarnated...

261
00:15:55,375 --> 00:15:57,416
She'll break his heart...

262
00:15:57,791 --> 00:16:00,416
Poor Amata will be left behind.

263
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:02,791
[AMATA]
It was...

264
00:16:02,875 --> 00:16:06,833
It was her choice.
I was left alone...

265
00:16:06,916 --> 00:16:11,458
I wanted to die...
Why did she go away...?

266
00:16:11,541 --> 00:16:15,291
[YUNOHA] I'm ready to go...
Please let me die...

267
00:16:15,375 --> 00:16:17,791
I don't want to
stay in this world...

268
00:16:17,875 --> 00:16:20,041
Not without Jin...

269
00:16:23,833 --> 00:16:29,125
Yunoha! Her aura's
disappearing completely!

270
00:16:34,083 --> 00:16:35,750
[FUDO]
Amata's power of flight...

271
00:16:35,833 --> 00:16:38,416
Zessica's telekinetic
distortions...

272
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:40,833
Shrade's haunting music...

273
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:46,208
Cayenne's clairvoyant despair
and Yunoha's ability to erase.

274
00:16:48,041 --> 00:16:50,333
[FUDO] Their minds are
racing out of control...

275
00:16:50,416 --> 00:16:52,708
...drawn to the end.

276
00:16:52,791 --> 00:16:54,458
Hold on Yunoha!

277
00:16:54,541 --> 00:16:56,583
Mikono, don't do that!

278
00:16:57,875 --> 00:17:00,208
[MIKONO] We finally got to
know each other as friends...

279
00:17:00,291 --> 00:17:02,875
I feel like we
really connected...

280
00:17:02,958 --> 00:17:05,333
Don't leave us...!

281
00:17:05,916 --> 00:17:11,166
I am not ready to lose
you like this! Please!

282
00:17:12,875 --> 00:17:15,166
[AMATA]
I can't.

283
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:18,166
Amata... wha--?

284
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:20,083
[AMATA]
If I'm born again...

285
00:17:20,166 --> 00:17:23,083
I'll just be left behind again.

286
00:17:27,666 --> 00:17:28,958
[AMATA]
No more...

287
00:17:29,041 --> 00:17:32,291
I don't want to be
abandoned ever again.

288
00:17:32,666 --> 00:17:35,250
[ZESSICA]
He's afraid... Amata...

289
00:17:35,333 --> 00:17:37,333
I won't abandon you!

290
00:17:38,083 --> 00:17:41,333
[YUNOHA] I can't...
I can't take it anymore...

291
00:17:41,416 --> 00:17:43,916
I don't wanna be left behind...

292
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,333
Let me stay...

293
00:17:45,416 --> 00:17:48,708
I want to stay here... with Jin.

294
00:17:51,416 --> 00:17:53,416
[AMATA]
I don't want to be born again...

295
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:55,833
it's... better down here.

296
00:17:55,916 --> 00:17:58,166
[YUNOHA]
Being alive and alone...

297
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:00,291
[ZESSICA]
It hurts!

298
00:18:00,375 --> 00:18:01,875
[AMATA]
Hurts to live.

299
00:18:01,958 --> 00:18:05,041
Listen to me... stop it now...!

300
00:18:06,208 --> 00:18:09,166
Don't leave me!

301
00:18:12,333 --> 00:18:13,750
What the hell?

302
00:18:13,833 --> 00:18:16,333
[FUDO] The shadow of death...
has catalyzed your power.

303
00:18:16,416 --> 00:18:18,583
[MIKONO]
What?

304
00:18:18,958 --> 00:18:20,333
[FUDO]
The end of our lives isn't

305
00:18:20,416 --> 00:18:22,875
the only death
humans experience...

306
00:18:22,958 --> 00:18:24,458
Think about
shedding your hair...

307
00:18:24,541 --> 00:18:26,750
or losing your baby teeth.

308
00:18:26,833 --> 00:18:30,166
The cells in our bodies are
constantly degenerating...

309
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:33,666
minute after minute,
and second by second.

310
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:37,041
Second... by second?

311
00:18:37,541 --> 00:18:40,041
Holding on to the dusty
relics of our past selves,

312
00:18:40,125 --> 00:18:43,166
refusing to progress
or to evolve--

313
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:44,916
Such behavior divides us,

314
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:49,791
cuts us off from the
universe and from each other.

315
00:18:49,875 --> 00:18:51,791
Mikono my dear...

316
00:18:51,875 --> 00:18:54,458
Your power is to connect
those who've been divided

317
00:18:54,541 --> 00:18:56,916
from themselves and
make them whole once more.

318
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,541
To make... them whole?

319
00:18:59,625 --> 00:19:00,791
[FUDO]
You must reach out

320
00:19:00,875 --> 00:19:03,083
to those too attached
to their old selves...

321
00:19:03,166 --> 00:19:06,083
nourish them on
their way to new life...

322
00:19:06,166 --> 00:19:08,458
Rebirth amidst the decay...

323
00:19:10,708 --> 00:19:14,125
[FUDO] Sequestered deep
within Vega's loam...

324
00:19:14,208 --> 00:19:17,125
You connect every
one of them...

325
00:19:17,208 --> 00:19:18,708
Linking their souls,

326
00:19:18,791 --> 00:19:22,708
dangling on the precipice
between life and death.

327
00:19:26,541 --> 00:19:29,666
[JIN] For ten thousand years
and two thousand more...

328
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:31,041
I've loved you.

329
00:19:31,125 --> 00:19:33,125
[MIKONO]
No way!

330
00:19:33,208 --> 00:19:35,083
[JIN] After another eight
thousand years passed...

331
00:19:35,166 --> 00:19:38,541
I loved you even more.

332
00:19:38,625 --> 00:19:40,291
[YUNOHA]
I know that voice!

333
00:19:40,375 --> 00:19:43,041
[JIN]
My whole life I was alone...

334
00:19:43,125 --> 00:19:46,708
I didn't care
about anybody else.

335
00:19:46,791 --> 00:19:48,791
[YUNOHA]
Jin... it's you!

336
00:19:48,875 --> 00:19:50,083
[JIN]
Yunoha...

337
00:19:50,166 --> 00:19:51,333
When we met...

338
00:19:51,416 --> 00:19:53,041
it was the first time
I actually felt

339
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:55,583
a real connection
with someone...

340
00:19:55,666 --> 00:19:58,791
I felt like I belonged.

341
00:19:59,708 --> 00:20:00,791
Please...

342
00:20:00,875 --> 00:20:03,083
You've got to keep
living for me...

343
00:20:03,166 --> 00:20:05,916
I need you... all of you.

344
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,500
All of us?

345
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:13,333
[JIN] I realized that
I've never been alone...

346
00:20:13,416 --> 00:20:15,500
Our lives are not our own...

347
00:20:15,583 --> 00:20:19,416
It's more like-- we're
all strands in a web.

348
00:20:21,541 --> 00:20:22,791
[YUNOHA]
Our lives...

349
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,541
[AMATA] Connected to
every living thing...

350
00:20:27,625 --> 00:20:30,333
He's right...

351
00:20:30,416 --> 00:20:33,791
We are not alone...
in life or in death...

352
00:20:33,875 --> 00:20:36,208
there's always a connection!

353
00:20:39,833 --> 00:20:41,875
The earth is so warm!

354
00:20:41,958 --> 00:20:45,125
We're being held up by the dead!

355
00:20:46,958 --> 00:20:48,166
[AMATA]
I feel like a baby again...

356
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:50,583
cradled gently in
my mother's arms...

357
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:52,625
If I'd never been born at all...

358
00:20:52,708 --> 00:20:55,708
I wouldn't be here
to experience this!

359
00:20:57,833 --> 00:20:59,125
If I'd never been born...

360
00:20:59,208 --> 00:21:00,625
I'd never have come here...

361
00:21:00,708 --> 00:21:02,666
I'd never have met Jin...

362
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:04,541
There's nothing
to be afraid of...

363
00:21:04,625 --> 00:21:07,125
in this grave or outside it!

364
00:21:07,541 --> 00:21:09,625
[ANDY] There'll be danger,
sure; I know that.

365
00:21:09,708 --> 00:21:11,875
But I've already
beaten the grave...

366
00:21:11,958 --> 00:21:13,541
Why should I fear it?

367
00:21:14,708 --> 00:21:16,541
[CAYENNE]
Another round of existence...

368
00:21:16,625 --> 00:21:20,000
another round of pain
and fear... But still...

369
00:21:20,083 --> 00:21:22,916
There are overtones and
sub-rhythms best heard

370
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,958
at the brink of death
and reincarnation!

371
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,458
[MIKONO] Exactly!

372
00:21:29,541 --> 00:21:31,250
Never be afraid!

373
00:21:31,333 --> 00:21:34,791
I'll always be here,
waiting for you!

374
00:21:36,375 --> 00:21:38,500
All of you are going
to be resurrected...

375
00:21:38,583 --> 00:21:41,291
Come back... I need you!

376
00:21:45,208 --> 00:21:46,541
[FUDO]
As time flows on

377
00:21:46,625 --> 00:21:49,333
our tribulations transform
us minute by minute,

378
00:21:49,416 --> 00:21:51,333
revive us second by second.

379
00:21:51,416 --> 00:21:54,375
Its inexorable current
has led to this point...

380
00:21:54,458 --> 00:21:57,375
The royal road... to change!

381
00:21:57,458 --> 00:21:58,958
To change?

382
00:21:59,041 --> 00:22:02,750
[FUDO] When a heart allows
itself to experience the now...

383
00:22:13,958 --> 00:22:16,791
[FUDO]
...thoughts... can truly merge.

384
00:22:23,708 --> 00:22:25,500
[ZESSICA]
What happened?

385
00:22:25,583 --> 00:22:26,583
Mikono, hey...

386
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:30,750
Happy Rebirthday!

387
00:22:47,458 --> 00:22:49,250
Not him!

388
00:24:23,791 --> 00:24:25,208
[DONAR]
It would seem rising

389
00:24:25,291 --> 00:24:27,166
from the grave gave these
kids the boost they needed...

390
00:24:27,250 --> 00:24:29,916
Which means it's time
for me to step up my game...

391
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,041
Guess my old taser's
due for an upgrade!

392
00:24:33,125 --> 00:24:36,291
Next time on Aquarion Evol:
"Love Beasts."
