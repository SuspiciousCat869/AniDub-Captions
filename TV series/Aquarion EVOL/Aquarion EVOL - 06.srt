1
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:17,791
Feeling better, I hope.

2
00:00:17,875 --> 00:00:21,125
Yeah, I am, as a matter
of fact. Thank you.

3
00:00:21,208 --> 00:00:22,458
What the...?

4
00:00:26,916 --> 00:00:29,750
Mikono's in the tower! Oh shit!

5
00:00:31,875 --> 00:00:33,166
Calling all Elements...

6
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:35,541
Abductors detected in
the Neo-Kowloon district.

7
00:00:35,625 --> 00:00:36,958
All training exercises

8
00:00:37,041 --> 00:00:39,125
are suspended
pending further notice.

9
00:00:40,166 --> 00:00:42,500
Elements Andy,
Zessica and Cayenne:

10
00:00:42,583 --> 00:00:45,291
report back to Neo-DEAVA
headquarters immediately.

11
00:00:45,375 --> 00:00:49,083
Go on, best not to
keep them waiting.

12
00:00:49,166 --> 00:00:50,958
I'll stay and see to Mikono.

13
00:00:51,041 --> 00:00:53,375
You should probably
go with Cayenne.

14
00:00:53,458 --> 00:00:55,250
If you think I'm going anywhere
with my sister's life hangin'--

15
00:00:55,333 --> 00:00:57,375
Her life is not a priority.

16
00:00:57,458 --> 00:01:00,416
Your duty to ward off
Abductors, however, is.

17
00:01:04,375 --> 00:01:06,500
Hey! Wait up!

18
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:11,625
Right--off you go.

19
00:01:13,375 --> 00:01:17,916
As rare a species of untrammeled
beauty your union will be,

20
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,791
I pity that I cannot
be part of it.

21
00:03:00,208 --> 00:03:01,958
Hey, sweetheart.

22
00:03:08,916 --> 00:03:10,000
You reek.

23
00:03:12,958 --> 00:03:15,416
You stink like carrion.

24
00:03:18,666 --> 00:03:20,291
No! Mikono!

25
00:03:20,833 --> 00:03:22,291
This is outrageous!

26
00:03:22,375 --> 00:03:25,375
Indeed, even worse...

27
00:03:25,458 --> 00:03:28,583
it bodes an unresolved tone.

28
00:03:37,583 --> 00:03:39,041
Mikono!

29
00:03:44,375 --> 00:03:47,291
Huh... s'like you're
made of porcelain.

30
00:03:47,791 --> 00:03:49,541
You let her go, right now!

31
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:57,125
What're you supposed to be?

32
00:03:57,208 --> 00:03:59,666
You don't have a scent.
How is that possible?

33
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:01,583
Everyone has a scent.

34
00:04:01,666 --> 00:04:04,208
What are you,
some kind of hologram?

35
00:04:06,083 --> 00:04:08,083
Meh. Whatever.

36
00:04:08,166 --> 00:04:11,708
So, boy, mind if
I tear ya to shreds?

37
00:04:11,791 --> 00:04:16,791
Um, well yeah, actually.

38
00:04:18,125 --> 00:04:20,708
Too bad.

39
00:04:20,791 --> 00:04:23,041
Hey! Come back!

40
00:04:23,125 --> 00:04:26,833
Get bent, freak...
The girl is mine.

41
00:04:26,916 --> 00:04:28,708
You'll have to find
your own wench.

42
00:04:39,083 --> 00:04:43,333
No! No! Put her down.

43
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:45,208
I'm warning you.

44
00:04:46,458 --> 00:04:48,750
Screw it! Mikono!

45
00:04:53,833 --> 00:04:55,166
Asshole!

46
00:05:19,375 --> 00:05:20,666
What is he?!

47
00:05:28,083 --> 00:05:29,166
What the hell is that?!

48
00:05:44,833 --> 00:05:47,875
He's gone to Vega, again.

49
00:05:47,958 --> 00:05:49,875
Who opened the gate for him?

50
00:05:49,958 --> 00:05:54,041
No, seriously;
his Gnis was on lockout.

51
00:05:56,958 --> 00:05:59,750
Such a vale of years
it's been, old friend.

52
00:06:01,166 --> 00:06:03,666
My, how Jin has grown.

53
00:06:05,333 --> 00:06:06,541
Aw crap!

54
00:06:06,625 --> 00:06:09,125
I thought this reeked of you.

55
00:06:09,208 --> 00:06:11,250
When did you awaken?

56
00:06:11,333 --> 00:06:15,833
When? An odd detail
to be concerned with.

57
00:06:15,916 --> 00:06:19,416
An angel's kiss is eternal,
or it is nothing.

58
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:22,125
Why fuel Kagura's obsession?

59
00:06:22,208 --> 00:06:26,666
I merely saw him off.
He is implacable.

60
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:29,000
He would have found
a way without me.

61
00:06:29,083 --> 00:06:30,833
Love always does.

62
00:06:30,916 --> 00:06:33,208
What is that supposed to mean?

63
00:06:34,125 --> 00:06:35,916
Powers now at large within your

64
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,250
modest little theatre of
war compel him to clarity.

65
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:42,458
The Rare Igura is
to him a siren song.

66
00:06:43,291 --> 00:06:45,666
Come. Some screed of curiosity

67
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:48,875
must lurk behind
that furrowed brow.

68
00:06:51,166 --> 00:06:55,333
The wayward hound may yet find
a way to bridle the warhorse.

69
00:06:55,416 --> 00:06:58,541
Patience,
our True Eve might even

70
00:06:58,625 --> 00:07:01,583
be delivered unto
Altair in the bargain.

71
00:07:07,458 --> 00:07:09,625
Go. Continue the recon.

72
00:07:10,041 --> 00:07:12,041
Keep an eye on Kagura.

73
00:07:12,125 --> 00:07:14,750
Take the Mithra back
by force if you must.

74
00:07:14,833 --> 00:07:16,416
All over it.

75
00:07:48,416 --> 00:07:50,083
Patience, darling.

76
00:08:06,333 --> 00:08:10,083
Quick question.
Mind if I tear you to shreds?

77
00:08:10,166 --> 00:08:15,041
Oh, be my guest. If you'll
play for the privilege.

78
00:08:25,375 --> 00:08:28,500
Oh well, at least
you have a scent.

79
00:08:28,583 --> 00:08:31,166
It reminds me a bit
of hers, actually.

80
00:08:38,041 --> 00:08:39,708
Damm it all...

81
00:08:50,708 --> 00:08:53,250
Your tone would be marvelous.

82
00:08:54,958 --> 00:08:58,166
Shrade decided to
remain in Neo-Kowloon.

83
00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:02,500
All to the good. Cayenne,
Zessica, Andy, get ready.

84
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:03,875
You'll deploy ASAP.

85
00:09:03,958 --> 00:09:05,791
Roger that.

86
00:09:06,708 --> 00:09:10,666
So, uuum, how come
Shrade's never been deployed?

87
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:14,208
I mean, you know, guess it
seems kinda wasteful is all.

88
00:09:16,666 --> 00:09:19,083
What? It's just...

89
00:09:19,166 --> 00:09:22,708
he does have the best
simulation record, doesn't he?

90
00:09:22,791 --> 00:09:25,041
I was-- I mean we
girls were wondering.

91
00:09:25,125 --> 00:09:27,875
Look, we can merge with
the opposite sex now.

92
00:09:27,958 --> 00:09:29,541
We have a right to know
a little something about

93
00:09:29,625 --> 00:09:31,666
who we could be
in the field with.

94
00:09:40,708 --> 00:09:42,166
Shrade's a prodigy.

95
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:46,666
He started piano when he was
two; mastered Chopin by four.

96
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:49,916
But his gifts came at a price.

97
00:09:50,333 --> 00:09:54,583
Every note he played had
something of darkness in it.

98
00:10:08,625 --> 00:10:10,166
It was said his music could bore

99
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:14,208
into your soul like fire,
drive you mad with anguish.

100
00:10:14,291 --> 00:10:15,958
Word got around about his power,

101
00:10:16,041 --> 00:10:19,583
so naturally certain interests
wanted to weaponize it.

102
00:10:49,125 --> 00:10:50,541
What is that sound?

103
00:11:09,208 --> 00:11:10,791
Neo-DEAVA?

104
00:11:14,166 --> 00:11:15,416
Are you serious?

105
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:18,250
So Shrade was actually
recruited by the chairman?

106
00:11:18,333 --> 00:11:20,791
Wait a sec.
How old is the chairman?

107
00:11:20,875 --> 00:11:21,875
Old.

108
00:11:21,958 --> 00:11:24,833
Shrade took the
aptitude test, like you.

109
00:11:24,916 --> 00:11:26,291
But, I don't think
anyone was prepared

110
00:11:26,375 --> 00:11:28,291
for the results they got.

111
00:11:29,416 --> 00:11:31,750
If he pilots a Vector
for even a few minutes,

112
00:11:31,833 --> 00:11:35,333
it would shorten
his life exponentially.

113
00:11:35,416 --> 00:11:36,958
His power's tremendous;

114
00:11:37,041 --> 00:11:39,916
God only knows what
Aquarion would do to him.

115
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,458
When merged, Elements resonate

116
00:11:41,541 --> 00:11:44,000
with each other, amplify
their collective energy.

117
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:48,708
Shrade's body can barely
support his gift as it is.

118
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:50,458
It's taken a huge toll.

119
00:11:50,541 --> 00:11:51,625
Being a tuning fork

120
00:11:51,708 --> 00:11:54,375
for two other Elements
would destroy him.

121
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:56,958
What is going on?!

122
00:11:57,041 --> 00:11:58,875
Forgive me.

123
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:01,500
She's a bit worse for
the wear, I'm afraid.

124
00:12:03,541 --> 00:12:06,500
Still, her tone is rich.

125
00:12:07,875 --> 00:12:11,583
A voice one would wish to have
at their ear as they lay dying.

126
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:27,666
Mikono?

127
00:12:28,333 --> 00:12:31,000
I'm so sorry.

128
00:12:31,833 --> 00:12:36,208
He should know. I owe it to him.

129
00:12:36,291 --> 00:12:38,083
I've always owed him.

130
00:12:38,166 --> 00:12:42,291
Owed who? You mean...?
C'mon, not him?

131
00:12:44,333 --> 00:12:46,458
Oh this is just great.

132
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,958
Be careful, guys.

133
00:12:57,833 --> 00:12:59,083
Lousy sons-a-bitches!

134
00:12:59,166 --> 00:13:01,208
Just leave us the hell alone!

135
00:13:02,291 --> 00:13:04,666
She belongs to me.

136
00:13:06,166 --> 00:13:08,000
And only me!

137
00:13:33,208 --> 00:13:34,500
There he is!

138
00:13:35,208 --> 00:13:37,833
Fantastic. The dog again.

139
00:13:37,916 --> 00:13:39,875
One Mithra Gnis.

140
00:13:39,958 --> 00:13:42,250
With all due respect,
High Commander,

141
00:13:42,333 --> 00:13:44,458
how do you know its name?

142
00:13:50,375 --> 00:13:55,291
That's more like it.
Come to daddy.

143
00:14:03,708 --> 00:14:04,958
Cayenne!

144
00:14:08,125 --> 00:14:09,583
Not you.

145
00:14:15,625 --> 00:14:17,041
Let's try you.

146
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:19,791
Zess, heads up!

147
00:14:32,166 --> 00:14:33,750
He wants Mikono.

148
00:14:33,833 --> 00:14:36,416
Bastard'll tear the city
apart looking for her.

149
00:14:39,541 --> 00:14:41,875
You're awake!
How are you feeling?

150
00:14:41,958 --> 00:14:46,333
Fine, I guess. But... where...?

151
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:49,625
It's cool, we're safe.

152
00:14:49,708 --> 00:14:52,666
But back there, you
said you owed that guy.

153
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:54,833
Huh? I said what?

154
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:59,750
It's all a fog.
I know I was scared.

155
00:14:59,833 --> 00:15:06,000
It's like, when he touched me,
I- I was petrified, but--

156
00:15:06,083 --> 00:15:08,458
But I could tell he cared.

157
00:15:08,541 --> 00:15:11,833
Then it was all,
kinda like deja vu.

158
00:15:22,791 --> 00:15:25,166
Come on! Get off my ass!

159
00:15:42,333 --> 00:15:46,166
Back off, boy.
The wench is mine!

160
00:16:05,166 --> 00:16:06,791
Hang in there, my friend.

161
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:08,708
Shrade?

162
00:16:13,708 --> 00:16:15,708
Allow me.

163
00:16:15,791 --> 00:16:18,708
What, like, take over?!
Are you nuts?

164
00:16:29,125 --> 00:16:32,416
Give her to me,
you bastards! She's mine!

165
00:16:34,125 --> 00:16:36,750
Mikono! You alright? That guy...

166
00:16:36,833 --> 00:16:39,708
Amata, please,
just get out of here!

167
00:16:39,791 --> 00:16:41,625
I'm feeling it...

168
00:16:41,708 --> 00:16:44,791
I think I'm getting déjà vu now.

169
00:16:47,541 --> 00:16:49,041
I know him.

170
00:16:49,125 --> 00:16:51,916
And I'm not gonna
let him take you away.

171
00:16:58,958 --> 00:17:00,041
The hell?!

172
00:17:00,125 --> 00:17:01,583
Hold up, that isn't...!

173
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:04,666
What's he doing?!

174
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:06,666
Who put him in a Vector?!

175
00:17:11,916 --> 00:17:13,625
Shrade, this is foolishness!

176
00:17:13,708 --> 00:17:15,916
Our foe requires
a specific harmony.

177
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,458
You know the missing
interval here is me.

178
00:17:18,541 --> 00:17:20,500
And you know
that this is suicide!

179
00:17:20,583 --> 00:17:22,291
Reason with the boy!

180
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:26,541
Element Change!
Pull Andy out of there, at once!

181
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:28,333
Aw, don't do this to me.

182
00:17:28,416 --> 00:17:30,833
I was so close to
merging with a chick!

183
00:17:36,125 --> 00:17:38,208
Come on! Come to me!

184
00:17:42,458 --> 00:17:43,666
Get offa me!

185
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:44,916
Vector Z!

186
00:17:47,791 --> 00:17:49,500
Make a run for it;
don't look back!

187
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:52,875
Amata!

188
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:05,875
Please, Chairman.
We need to merge.

189
00:18:05,958 --> 00:18:07,208
Out of the question!

190
00:18:07,291 --> 00:18:08,166
Don't do it!

191
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:09,875
I'm ready for it, Crea.

192
00:18:09,958 --> 00:18:13,583
I have dwelt in
limbo for far too long.

193
00:18:13,666 --> 00:18:17,125
Aquarion's music
will set me free.

194
00:18:31,708 --> 00:18:33,750
Fine.

195
00:18:35,125 --> 00:18:38,541
Merge is authorized!
Shrade is the head!

196
00:18:38,625 --> 00:18:40,541
Good luck, all of you.

197
00:18:44,708 --> 00:18:46,291
Oh, how I've waited for this.

198
00:18:47,666 --> 00:18:51,458
This shall be a
concertante for the ages.

199
00:18:51,541 --> 00:18:55,791
Melodic Union! Go! Aquarion!

200
00:19:07,916 --> 00:19:11,083
Oh my, it's like music is
running through my blood!

201
00:19:11,166 --> 00:19:14,125
It feels so tranquil.

202
00:19:14,208 --> 00:19:19,416
This is nature's music-- the
glorious sound of life itself!

203
00:19:25,208 --> 00:19:27,291
Aquarion Spada!

204
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:31,208
A union with
Vector Y as the head...

205
00:19:31,291 --> 00:19:33,500
Another form has been unlocked!

206
00:19:35,958 --> 00:19:38,208
Shrade is this triad's tonic.

207
00:19:38,291 --> 00:19:41,875
The music of his soul has
pushed Aquarion even further.

208
00:19:48,458 --> 00:19:50,875
You lovely creature.

209
00:19:51,833 --> 00:19:54,500
If the eye truly be
the scout of the heart,

210
00:19:54,583 --> 00:19:56,541
the ear is its betrothed.

211
00:19:56,625 --> 00:19:58,916
From the moment
I caught your sublime echo,

212
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,208
my blood pounded, staccato...

213
00:20:01,291 --> 00:20:03,458
my very being crescendoed...

214
00:20:03,541 --> 00:20:06,291
You are my song of songs.

215
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:13,125
Damn you, false angel!
Get out of my way!

216
00:20:13,208 --> 00:20:19,125
Amata, Zessica, understand this,
please-- all things are music.

217
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:21,958
Death is only modulation.

218
00:20:22,041 --> 00:20:26,250
If this fight is my elegy,
help me to make it beautiful!

219
00:20:26,333 --> 00:20:27,416
Yes, sir!

220
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:30,000
You got it; we're
with you all the way!

221
00:20:34,416 --> 00:20:37,375
Let us begin. Molto espressivo!

222
00:20:44,791 --> 00:20:46,083
Damn it!

223
00:20:49,208 --> 00:20:51,458
Look at that!
Amata's aura is spiking!

224
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:54,708
Along with Zessica's
element power,

225
00:20:54,791 --> 00:20:58,708
we have achieved a truly
breathtaking resonance.

226
00:20:58,791 --> 00:21:00,708
The moon above us, legato.

227
00:21:00,791 --> 00:21:03,708
Its image in the water
below us, allegro vivace...

228
00:21:03,791 --> 00:21:04,958
What?

229
00:21:05,041 --> 00:21:09,250
Its image in us,
assai maestoso! With feeling!

230
00:21:10,666 --> 00:21:13,083
Hear our Moonlight Requiem!

231
00:21:17,875 --> 00:21:19,000
No!

232
00:21:40,375 --> 00:21:42,208
Did they beat him?

233
00:21:45,166 --> 00:21:47,541
This isn't over.

234
00:21:47,625 --> 00:21:49,833
You hear me, you assholes?!

235
00:21:52,041 --> 00:21:53,166
Believe you have something that,

236
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:55,416
strictly speaking,
doesn't belong to you.

237
00:21:55,916 --> 00:21:58,833
Dude, why you gotta make
my job such a kick in the balls?

238
00:21:58,916 --> 00:22:01,166
Seriously; what'd
I ever do to you?

239
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:03,708
Jin, what are you----?!

240
00:22:08,708 --> 00:22:10,458
He's making a run for it!

241
00:22:10,541 --> 00:22:12,750
Hey Shrade, we gotta
go after him now!

242
00:22:14,208 --> 00:22:15,791
Shrade?

243
00:22:15,875 --> 00:22:17,375
No! We're losing him!

244
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:21,958
Don't do this, man!
Stay with us!

245
00:22:22,041 --> 00:22:22,833
Shrade!

246
00:22:22,916 --> 00:22:24,541
Shrade!!

247
00:22:31,375 --> 00:22:33,833
Mikono, you okay? What's wrong?

248
00:22:33,916 --> 00:22:38,750
I-- I don't know.

249
00:22:38,833 --> 00:22:43,875
It's like-- like all this is
jogging my memory?

250
00:24:23,666 --> 00:24:24,916
You hear the one
about the Element

251
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,416
who went to the john one
night and never came back?

252
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:29,166
They say the body's
bricked up somewhere

253
00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:32,166
on campus --that their
ghost still walks the halls.

254
00:24:32,250 --> 00:24:35,666
Next time on Aquarion Evol:
"Midnight Girl."
