1
00:00:14,375 --> 00:00:17,750
Tell me, Apollon,
do you remember?

2
00:00:17,833 --> 00:00:20,083
The day when the world began,

3
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:23,291
there was nothing and
there was everything.

4
00:00:23,375 --> 00:00:25,250
Billions of stars swirling in

5
00:00:25,333 --> 00:00:28,583
a great void, light
inside of darkness.

6
00:00:28,666 --> 00:00:31,208
Our souls knew each
other even then.

7
00:00:31,291 --> 00:00:33,000
Our souls?

8
00:00:33,083 --> 00:00:34,583
Yes.

9
00:00:34,666 --> 00:00:38,791
High above it all, captivated by
the vision, your hand in mine.

10
00:00:38,875 --> 00:00:41,625
Two wayward souls,
sharing one heart.

11
00:00:42,458 --> 00:00:44,125
Silvie.

12
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:48,458
And now, together, we will
mend what we have broken.

13
00:00:59,916 --> 00:01:01,666
You never get
tired of this, huh?

14
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:03,541
Er--sorry! I got distracted.

15
00:01:03,625 --> 00:01:04,875
I'm on task, I swear--

16
00:01:04,958 --> 00:01:07,541
You and Skies of Aquaria
were made for each other.

17
00:01:07,625 --> 00:01:11,666
It's fine. 'sides, you're the
only reason we show it anymore.

18
00:01:13,791 --> 00:01:18,500
Your scent, your essence
follows me into Eternity!

19
00:01:18,583 --> 00:01:21,333
One day you'll have to
tell me what the appeal is.

20
00:01:21,416 --> 00:01:23,250
Apart from Alicia, that I get,

21
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:26,208
her Silvie almost
makes this watchable.

22
00:01:28,833 --> 00:01:31,375
She doesn't do anything;
just hovers there.

23
00:01:31,458 --> 00:01:33,875
What is going through her head?

24
00:01:33,958 --> 00:01:36,291
The man she loves is dying.

25
00:01:36,375 --> 00:01:38,083
Probably thinkin'
the rent's due.

26
00:01:38,166 --> 00:01:40,958
Listen, don't worry about
loadin' the reels, awright?

27
00:01:41,041 --> 00:01:43,041
Just clean the
aisles 'fore you go.

28
00:01:43,125 --> 00:01:46,250
And, try not to let the silver
screen spoil ya for real life.

29
00:01:46,333 --> 00:01:47,541
Yes, sir.

30
00:01:50,916 --> 00:01:54,125
I shall wait for you,
my brave Apollon.

31
00:01:54,208 --> 00:01:59,291
For twelve-thousand years,
if I must. If I must...

32
00:02:10,208 --> 00:02:12,458
Ugh, gross. Really?

33
00:02:12,541 --> 00:02:15,166
How hard is it to
find a trashcan, people?

34
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:24,291
Excuse me. We're, uh...

35
00:02:34,166 --> 00:02:36,958
Oh! I, uh... Sorry, leaving.

36
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:47,083
Hang on!

37
00:02:52,041 --> 00:02:54,333
You're not like a fan, are you?

38
00:02:54,416 --> 00:02:55,791
I mean of Skies of Aquaria?

39
00:02:55,875 --> 00:02:58,500
I dunno. It was the first
time I've seen it actually.

40
00:02:58,583 --> 00:03:01,916
Oh, um, never mind.

41
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:04,416
See ya 'round, I guess.

42
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:05,666
No wait!

43
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:07,666
I was kinda hoping you
might tell me your name.

44
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:09,708
If you're cool with that.

45
00:03:11,041 --> 00:03:13,583
It's Mikono. Mikono Suzushiro.

46
00:03:13,666 --> 00:03:15,916
Amata! I'm Amata Sora!

47
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,541
Huh, okay.

48
00:03:24,583 --> 00:03:25,875
So...

49
00:03:25,958 --> 00:03:26,875
Yeah?

50
00:03:26,958 --> 00:03:28,125
It's, uh, real nice

51
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:31,083
to see some people still
care about old movies.

52
00:03:35,375 --> 00:03:38,583
Question... Do you guys have,
like, pamphlets on this one?

53
00:03:38,666 --> 00:03:40,583
Yeah sorry, no.

54
00:03:40,666 --> 00:03:42,541
All the promotional
stuff was trashed.

55
00:03:42,625 --> 00:03:44,333
Pretty much right
after the premier.

56
00:03:44,416 --> 00:03:46,541
Oh. Well that's a shame.

57
00:03:46,625 --> 00:03:49,250
I suppose there's always
still word of mouth, huh?

58
00:03:49,708 --> 00:03:53,458
Maybe you and I could sit
and talk about it for a while.

59
00:03:53,541 --> 00:03:55,625
You actually wanna talk to me?

60
00:03:55,708 --> 00:03:59,750
It's gonna be a little while;
I have to finish up here.

61
00:03:59,833 --> 00:04:01,250
I'm okay to wait,
long as you don't mind me

62
00:04:01,333 --> 00:04:05,000
just hanging out
"for twelve-thousand years,

63
00:04:05,083 --> 00:04:06,583
if I must," or whatever.

64
00:04:07,458 --> 00:04:10,916
I'm a nerd, sorry--it was
just a neat line, you know?

65
00:04:15,958 --> 00:04:18,916
Oh, crap! No!
No, no, no, no, no!

66
00:04:22,791 --> 00:04:25,208
Uh would you mind
waiting outside?

67
00:04:25,291 --> 00:04:27,833
Just so I can close up.
Give me, like, five minutes.

68
00:04:27,916 --> 00:04:29,875
Ten, tops.

69
00:04:41,458 --> 00:04:43,333
Surely three per
boot'll be enough.

70
00:04:44,833 --> 00:04:47,000
Wow. She wants to talk.

71
00:04:47,666 --> 00:04:50,333
And she's cute, so
I'm probably just dreaming.

72
00:05:02,291 --> 00:05:04,208
Hang on! Wait! Please!

73
00:05:04,291 --> 00:05:06,166
Tell me where you're going!

74
00:05:07,333 --> 00:05:10,500
All I could do was
watch, same as her.

75
00:05:12,375 --> 00:05:14,958
But that was then and
this is now. So, yeah.

76
00:05:17,208 --> 00:05:19,375
Don't freak out. It's fine.

77
00:05:19,458 --> 00:05:21,625
Not every girl's gonna leave.

78
00:05:23,041 --> 00:05:24,958
I'm okay to wait, long
as you don't mind me just

79
00:05:25,041 --> 00:05:27,625
hanging out "for
twelve-thousand years,

80
00:05:27,708 --> 00:05:29,708
if I must," or whatever.

81
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:35,958
Excuse me! Dibs on your gondola!

82
00:05:49,291 --> 00:05:50,625
Neo-China's teetering
infrastructure was further

83
00:05:50,708 --> 00:05:53,666
compromised this afternoon
when a fleet of Abductors

84
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:55,916
swept down from the skies
in what authorities are...

85
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,041
I hate it when they
talk about Abductors.

86
00:05:58,125 --> 00:05:59,958
Yeah, no kidding.

87
00:06:00,041 --> 00:06:02,375
There's never any
good news to begin with,

88
00:06:02,458 --> 00:06:04,291
but now that
everyone's being taken,

89
00:06:04,375 --> 00:06:06,458
there's not much
else to talk about.

90
00:06:06,541 --> 00:06:07,958
And the worst part's
gotta be not knowing

91
00:06:08,041 --> 00:06:09,250
where they'll strike.

92
00:06:09,333 --> 00:06:12,166
We beat 'em back,
sure, but, it's kinda like--

93
00:06:12,958 --> 00:06:15,125
Well, I'm not just
gonna hide while I wait

94
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:17,083
for them to
gatecrash again.

95
00:06:17,166 --> 00:06:20,208
If today's all I have,
why not enjoy it?

96
00:06:20,291 --> 00:06:22,375
Like there's no tomorrow, huh?

97
00:06:23,458 --> 00:06:25,500
Seems sorta appropriate,
don't you think?

98
00:06:27,833 --> 00:06:28,958
You okay?

99
00:06:34,583 --> 00:06:35,333
The hell is that?!

100
00:06:35,416 --> 00:06:36,625
Sorry! My fault!

101
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,333
I really shoulda
warned you about Shush.

102
00:06:40,416 --> 00:06:42,916
Seriously, what is it
about kitties and hair?

103
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,333
Wait, that's a cat?

104
00:06:45,416 --> 00:06:47,125
Yeah, what else?

105
00:06:48,083 --> 00:06:50,125
Did something
happen to it, or...?

106
00:06:50,208 --> 00:06:52,666
I found him as I took
cover from an Abductor.

107
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:54,125
Poor lil' guy...

108
00:06:54,666 --> 00:06:57,583
Oh, right! Let's talk
Skies of Aquaria.

109
00:06:57,666 --> 00:06:59,208
You got it.

110
00:06:59,291 --> 00:07:02,708
Skies of Aquaria: adapted
from a book no one remembers

111
00:07:02,791 --> 00:07:04,833
about humanity's war
with the Shadow Angels

112
00:07:04,916 --> 00:07:06,625
twelve thousand years ago.

113
00:07:06,708 --> 00:07:07,791
Weren't the Shadow Angels

114
00:07:07,875 --> 00:07:09,666
just a story to make
little kids behave?

115
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:11,666
That's part of why the
movie didn't do so hot

116
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:13,000
when it came out;

117
00:07:13,083 --> 00:07:14,625
but the theme song won
like every award there is.

118
00:07:14,708 --> 00:07:16,916
Yeah? It is a really good song.

119
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,583
The lead sang it. What's
her name? Alicia, I think.

120
00:07:21,666 --> 00:07:22,750
Total triple threat.

121
00:07:22,833 --> 00:07:25,125
She could act and sing,
and pretty enough

122
00:07:25,208 --> 00:07:27,500
to model if she got
sick of doing those.

123
00:07:27,583 --> 00:07:30,375
Yeah. She was beautiful.

124
00:07:30,458 --> 00:07:32,750
It has a weird way
of making me sad.

125
00:07:34,583 --> 00:07:37,708
We were supposed to
share that! Dang it, Shush!

126
00:07:45,375 --> 00:07:47,125
Hey, you wanna know
something else weird?

127
00:07:47,208 --> 00:07:49,375
Vector pilots, the guys
that fight Abductors,

128
00:07:49,458 --> 00:07:51,333
you practically have
to be superhuman just

129
00:07:51,416 --> 00:07:53,875
to get accepted into
where they're trained.

130
00:07:53,958 --> 00:07:56,916
They're called Elements:
people with special powers

131
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,333
hand-picked by the
Aquarias themselves.

132
00:07:59,416 --> 00:08:00,666
Least that's what they say.

133
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:03,375
Reminds me of
Apollon and Silvie.

134
00:08:04,416 --> 00:08:08,583
Imagine sitting at the controls
of a mech that chose you.

135
00:08:12,583 --> 00:08:15,125
I'd be lying if I said
I hadn't thought about it.

136
00:08:16,208 --> 00:08:20,583
But, let's just say I'm not the
kind of guy who gets chosen.

137
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:22,125
I'm a nobody.

138
00:08:23,541 --> 00:08:27,000
That a fact? Hey, me too.

139
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:29,708
All I'm good for is
staying out of the way.

140
00:08:29,791 --> 00:08:33,291
Oh well! Guess that
makes two of us!

141
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,291
Uh, gotta make a pit stop.

142
00:08:39,375 --> 00:08:41,166
Go on ahead, I'll catch up.

143
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,666
I know you can hear me, Kagura.

144
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:57,166
This is no time for games.
The Mithra Gnis is a test model.

145
00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:59,083
No frills. Strictly recon.

146
00:09:03,166 --> 00:09:05,791
Ooo. Something's pungent.

147
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:08,500
Hello Vega.

148
00:09:15,083 --> 00:09:17,583
Ten? Really? This is
getting out of hand.

149
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:23,666
"Only good for
staying out of the way."

150
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:25,375
She makes it sound like a game,

151
00:09:25,458 --> 00:09:27,708
like being a nobody is
just something you do.

152
00:09:27,791 --> 00:09:29,416
How is she so cheerful?

153
00:09:30,625 --> 00:09:31,958
How can you take so long?

154
00:09:32,041 --> 00:09:34,125
Dad, I gotta go!
Make him come out!

155
00:09:34,208 --> 00:09:36,958
Sorry! Gimme a sec!

156
00:09:40,541 --> 00:09:42,500
I said gimme a sec, jeez!

157
00:09:44,583 --> 00:09:45,666
What the...?!

158
00:09:58,083 --> 00:09:59,333
Not now!

159
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:51,041
Mikono!

160
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:53,083
We gotta get to the shelter!

161
00:11:09,458 --> 00:11:10,416
Look out!

162
00:11:18,791 --> 00:11:20,666
Whoa. It's an Aquaria.

163
00:11:37,041 --> 00:11:39,208
I swear, dude, every time.

164
00:11:39,291 --> 00:11:41,791
Why do these freak shows
gotta be so damn persistent?

165
00:11:41,875 --> 00:11:43,458
Doesn't really
concern you, Andy.

166
00:11:43,541 --> 00:11:45,416
They show up,
we give 'em the hurt.

167
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:47,333
Type M is on the scene, sir.

168
00:11:47,416 --> 00:11:48,541
Roger that.

169
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:51,458
May the legend guide
our hand in this battle.

170
00:11:52,125 --> 00:11:53,166
The Abductors have brought

171
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:55,541
quite an entourage
with them this time.

172
00:11:55,625 --> 00:11:57,916
I'm getting reports of heavy
damage at ground zero.

173
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,458
Chief Instructor--apologies;
Commander...

174
00:12:00,541 --> 00:12:01,875
Against a fleet of this size,

175
00:12:01,958 --> 00:12:04,458
do you think these boys
are our wisest option?

176
00:12:04,541 --> 00:12:05,958
Of course you'd go there,

177
00:12:06,041 --> 00:12:09,333
and I suppose your little ladies
are models of discipline?

178
00:12:09,416 --> 00:12:11,916
We've got a massive Abductor
bearing down on the site.

179
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,083
A type the database
doesn't recognize.

180
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:15,916
Show us!

181
00:12:22,583 --> 00:12:23,500
What the hell?!

182
00:12:23,583 --> 00:12:25,375
Simulation didn't
cover this one!

183
00:12:36,416 --> 00:12:37,583
Ah, damn!

184
00:12:37,666 --> 00:12:39,500
It's fast, like,
seriously fast. What do we do?

185
00:12:39,583 --> 00:12:41,666
Keep it together,
Malloy: I'm thinking.

186
00:12:46,875 --> 00:12:49,458
We're, uh, picking up vital
signs from the Abductor's core.

187
00:12:49,541 --> 00:12:50,375
What?

188
00:12:50,458 --> 00:12:52,166
Someone's inside that thing!

189
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:54,500
You're trying to tell me
this one's got a pilot?

190
00:12:55,416 --> 00:12:56,833
You son of a--

191
00:13:00,916 --> 00:13:02,833
It's dancing circles
around these guys.

192
00:13:02,916 --> 00:13:05,875
Yeah, right?
Like it's toying with them.

193
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:13,416
This is bull!

194
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,375
The Vectors are taking
heavy damage, sir!

195
00:13:15,458 --> 00:13:16,666
Tachyon levels dropping!

196
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:19,583
Chief Instructor--
uh... Commander!

197
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:32,291
Yes, sir, loud 'n clear.
We'll make it so.

198
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:36,958
We're authorized
to deploy Type F.

199
00:13:37,041 --> 00:13:38,541
You've got to be joking!

200
00:13:38,625 --> 00:13:41,500
Surely they can't mean to let an
F and an M operate in tandem!

201
00:13:41,583 --> 00:13:44,000
Damn right!
It's forbidden for a reason!

202
00:13:44,083 --> 00:13:45,958
Our Type M is on
the verge of being torn

203
00:13:46,041 --> 00:13:47,791
to shrapnel out there, damn it.

204
00:13:47,875 --> 00:13:49,583
We're not letting that happen.

205
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:56,041
Damn it!

206
00:13:56,541 --> 00:13:57,791
Target acquired!

207
00:13:57,875 --> 00:13:59,416
Missiles, locked on!

208
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:16,208
Shit! What the--?

209
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:25,000
Hiya, fellas, don't mind us.
Just here to save ya.

210
00:14:25,083 --> 00:14:27,666
No offense or anything,
but you fight like savages.

211
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:29,750
Scale it back on the
testosterone, guys.

212
00:14:29,833 --> 00:14:32,208
Cayenne! I'm your biggest fan!

213
00:14:32,875 --> 00:14:34,375
Whoa! Hello nurse!

214
00:14:34,458 --> 00:14:36,833
Um, is this supposed to
be happening?

215
00:14:38,166 --> 00:14:39,833
This is gonna be catastrophic.

216
00:14:39,916 --> 00:14:41,583
Let's hope we avoid the worst.

217
00:14:41,666 --> 00:14:44,041
You realize if they
merge it'll be blasphemy.

218
00:14:44,125 --> 00:14:46,375
I'm well aware of
what the sacred texts

219
00:14:46,458 --> 00:14:48,625
say about cross-gender
union, Donar.

220
00:14:48,708 --> 00:14:51,625
But worry not; the Guize stones
will see to their purity.

221
00:14:51,708 --> 00:14:53,625
They'll be kept separate!

222
00:14:58,041 --> 00:15:02,041
Oh, man, heh. Somebody's scent
here is raising my hackles.

223
00:15:02,875 --> 00:15:04,416
We'll snare him
in a pincer attack!

224
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,250
And you get to
call the shots why?

225
00:15:11,375 --> 00:15:12,875
Damn it! Hold still!

226
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:25,500
Come on!

227
00:15:25,583 --> 00:15:27,208
We can handle this
if you'd back off!

228
00:15:27,291 --> 00:15:28,208
You're crowding us!

229
00:15:28,291 --> 00:15:29,750
This is an absolute farce.

230
00:15:29,833 --> 00:15:31,291
What did we expect?

231
00:15:31,375 --> 00:15:34,208
None of them thought they'd
be working coed this afternoon.

232
00:15:39,583 --> 00:15:41,125
What kind of move is that?!

233
00:15:58,166 --> 00:15:58,875
Mix, take us down!

234
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:00,208
Copy that!

235
00:16:05,416 --> 00:16:07,500
Mikono? Are you alright?

236
00:16:11,416 --> 00:16:12,958
Amata! You're...

237
00:16:13,041 --> 00:16:14,708
Yeah I know.

238
00:16:14,791 --> 00:16:15,833
But...

239
00:16:15,916 --> 00:16:19,000
I'm fine. Just a scratch.
No worries.

240
00:16:20,083 --> 00:16:24,041
A little blood I can do without,
but you're a whole other story.

241
00:16:28,708 --> 00:16:30,791
Type M, you read me?
A little help?

242
00:16:30,875 --> 00:16:32,333
Yeah, about that...

243
00:16:32,416 --> 00:16:34,416
We're, kinda out of commission
till Malloy springs back.

244
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:37,416
Figures. How'd you
pass the prelims?

245
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,541
Look!

246
00:16:42,833 --> 00:16:44,166
It's on all fours!

247
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,208
That bouquet...

248
00:17:13,291 --> 00:17:14,541
What is it doing?

249
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:20,916
Animal.

250
00:17:26,208 --> 00:17:27,458
Mikono!

251
00:17:27,541 --> 00:17:30,750
Stop trying to move!
You're hurt enough as it is!

252
00:17:33,875 --> 00:17:35,791
Mikono!

253
00:17:40,666 --> 00:17:42,958
Vector pilot auras are
dropping rapidly, sir!

254
00:17:43,041 --> 00:17:44,041
Damn it!

255
00:17:44,125 --> 00:17:46,208
The formations are breaking up!

256
00:17:48,208 --> 00:17:49,791
Those poor Aquarias.

257
00:17:49,875 --> 00:17:52,666
All right, fine.
No more holding back.

258
00:17:59,541 --> 00:18:01,291
Oh, Mix! Sazanka!

259
00:18:01,375 --> 00:18:02,791
Andy!

260
00:18:02,875 --> 00:18:04,833
Damn you! Who gave
you the order to bail?!

261
00:18:04,916 --> 00:18:06,750
Wha...? Nobody, sir!

262
00:18:06,833 --> 00:18:09,000
Something just
pulled me out of there!

263
00:18:09,708 --> 00:18:11,750
I'm fine. Send me back in!

264
00:18:11,833 --> 00:18:13,333
We didn't pull you...

265
00:18:13,416 --> 00:18:14,750
Unheard of.

266
00:18:14,833 --> 00:18:17,958
Why would the Aquarias suddenly
jettison their Elements?

267
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:25,958
Sorry, I have to do this.

268
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,583
Uh, wait, why are you sorry?

269
00:18:37,583 --> 00:18:41,375
Believe me, all I was
trying to do was protect you.

270
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:43,416
I didn't...

271
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:44,958
I...

272
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:56,041
Hang on!

273
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,375
That can't be Solar Wing?!

274
00:19:15,666 --> 00:19:16,791
Oh no!

275
00:19:31,791 --> 00:19:35,125
Vector Z's giving off vital
signs. No idea how, but...

276
00:19:36,625 --> 00:19:39,583
Someone's on board?
How is that possible?

277
00:19:39,666 --> 00:19:40,958
We've got hijackers!

278
00:19:41,041 --> 00:19:42,833
Wait, that's a girl
and guy, isn't it?!

279
00:19:42,916 --> 00:19:44,750
Oh dear! Mix, eject them now!

280
00:19:44,833 --> 00:19:46,416
Right!

281
00:19:47,666 --> 00:19:48,916
Problem.

282
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,416
Apparently their life
force can't be extricated

283
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:52,375
from the Vector's
energy core.

284
00:19:53,791 --> 00:19:57,541
Perhaps they were...
Perhaps they were chosen.

285
00:19:57,625 --> 00:19:59,166
Commander!

286
00:19:59,666 --> 00:20:01,166
Where are we?

287
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:03,833
I think we're inside a Vector.

288
00:20:05,041 --> 00:20:06,291
Really?

289
00:20:06,375 --> 00:20:09,166
Crazy, huh?
What are the chances?

290
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:12,666
But, it just feels right.

291
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:15,916
I- I think I know
what I have to do.

292
00:20:17,083 --> 00:20:18,625
Then, go for it.

293
00:20:22,458 --> 00:20:23,458
Awright, move in.

294
00:20:23,541 --> 00:20:25,083
Yeah, I gathered that.

295
00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:28,000
Shatter the false idol.

296
00:20:28,083 --> 00:20:32,750
As it crumbles to dust,
speak truth to power.

297
00:20:32,833 --> 00:20:37,166
Say the name,
and inherit a legend!

298
00:20:37,833 --> 00:20:39,333
Truth to power.

299
00:20:39,416 --> 00:20:42,375
What is that supposed to mean?

300
00:20:42,458 --> 00:20:45,125
Its name. It's been
waiting for so many years,

301
00:20:45,208 --> 00:20:47,541
waiting for us to say it.

302
00:20:50,333 --> 00:20:56,000
Genesis Union! Go! Aquarion!

303
00:21:04,125 --> 00:21:06,375
Did he say "Aquarion"?!

304
00:21:06,458 --> 00:21:07,958
Surely he couldnt've.

305
00:21:08,041 --> 00:21:12,416
This is big. That name's not
been uttered aloud in years.

306
00:21:18,708 --> 00:21:22,166
Wait! Stop it!
We're not allowed to merge!

307
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:25,291
I-- This-- this is amazing...

308
00:21:28,458 --> 00:21:32,375
Sir! What is going on here?
Tell me, please!

309
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:35,666
It's fine!
The Guize Stones are safe.

310
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:37,541
No one's merging with anyone.

311
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:42,958
I can't handle this!

312
00:21:43,041 --> 00:21:46,833
This feeling, it's too much!
I'm gonna be torn apart!

313
00:21:46,916 --> 00:21:49,583
What is this? What is this?!

314
00:21:50,916 --> 00:21:54,750
Something inside me
is about to break!

315
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:00,625
This is happening!

316
00:22:15,166 --> 00:22:17,375
What-- what am I looking at?

317
00:22:17,458 --> 00:22:20,750
It's like it's evolving. Oh wow.

318
00:22:21,166 --> 00:22:24,208
Aquarion Evol!

319
00:22:28,791 --> 00:22:30,666
What is that?

320
00:22:32,958 --> 00:22:35,708
Whatever you are. You reek.

321
00:22:37,291 --> 00:22:43,916
An ancient name bears a
new form... Aquarion Evol!

322
00:22:45,458 --> 00:22:47,750
Our time has come.

323
00:22:47,833 --> 00:22:51,666
The first chord of the final
cadence has been struck.

324
00:24:23,416 --> 00:24:26,666
This'll probably sound weird,
but when I make ramen

325
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:29,166
I let 'em boil way longer
than you're supposed to.

326
00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:32,958
I dunno. I like
soggy noodles, okay?!

327
00:24:33,041 --> 00:24:35,958
Next time on Aquarion Evol,
"Forbidden Union."
