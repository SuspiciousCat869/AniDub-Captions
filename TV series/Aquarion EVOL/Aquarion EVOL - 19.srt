1
00:00:16,541 --> 00:00:19,000
I should kill you,
you son of a bitch!

2
00:00:23,166 --> 00:00:24,333
Amata!

3
00:00:25,166 --> 00:00:26,125
That's enough!

4
00:00:26,208 --> 00:00:29,166
Like hell it is!
Let go! You bastard!

5
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:32,041
You could've saved her
and you did nothing!

6
00:00:32,875 --> 00:00:34,583
Stop it, that's not how it was!

7
00:00:34,666 --> 00:00:36,416
[MALLOY]
Dude! He was kinda busy

8
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:38,333
keeping Zess
from getting killed!

9
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:42,625
No, wait!

10
00:00:43,958 --> 00:00:45,791
You gonna piss this
anger away on Amata...

11
00:00:45,875 --> 00:00:48,708
or you gonna use it
to get your girl back?

12
00:00:48,791 --> 00:00:50,625
Are you fucking kidding me...?!

13
00:00:50,708 --> 00:00:51,916
If I could get her back...

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,916
You think I'd be standing here?!

15
00:00:56,208 --> 00:00:57,541
Why...?

16
00:00:58,250 --> 00:00:59,666
[CREA]
Sadly, no distortion field

17
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:01,625
remained once the Gate closed...

18
00:01:01,708 --> 00:01:04,208
In short, the trail went cold.

19
00:01:04,291 --> 00:01:07,000
This is monstrous...!
What do we do now?!

20
00:01:07,083 --> 00:01:08,875
Dammit...!
High Commander Fudo picked

21
00:01:08,958 --> 00:01:11,375
a hell of a time to
go on sabbatical!

22
00:01:11,458 --> 00:01:13,166
He was compelled to do so.

23
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:17,416
Spurred on by portent
of worlds in collision.

24
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:19,500
Fortunately, Zen Fudo
is the sort of creature

25
00:01:19,583 --> 00:01:21,750
to whom such omens
mean something only

26
00:01:21,833 --> 00:01:24,708
when he feels their
verdict can be overruled.

27
00:01:28,166 --> 00:01:32,458
Lo... The mighty ant...
Nature's infiltrator.

28
00:03:09,916 --> 00:03:11,250
Mix...

29
00:03:11,333 --> 00:03:14,041
If only I'd had
a little more time...

30
00:03:15,416 --> 00:03:18,500
I... I never got to hold you...

31
00:03:19,125 --> 00:03:22,250
Never got to bury my
face in those colossal...

32
00:03:25,708 --> 00:03:26,958
 What is wrong with you?!

33
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:28,833
She's a POW on some
forsaken rock halfway 'cross

34
00:03:28,916 --> 00:03:31,458
the universe and that's
where your mind goes?!

35
00:03:31,541 --> 00:03:35,708
Stupid... Flipping...
Douchebag... Pervert!

36
00:03:39,625 --> 00:03:42,250
Andy, please...
You've got to eat.

37
00:03:47,958 --> 00:03:51,000
[YUNOHA] That's two days
in a row without food.

38
00:03:51,083 --> 00:03:55,375
The longer he's down there,
the worse I feel for him.

39
00:03:55,458 --> 00:03:57,041
Yeah, right...?

40
00:03:57,791 --> 00:03:59,958
I know what it
is to lose someone.

41
00:04:00,041 --> 00:04:02,958
I can't bear the thought
of him going though this.

42
00:04:04,666 --> 00:04:06,625
Hey, he'll be fine.

43
00:04:06,708 --> 00:04:09,791
I'm gonna take
care of this, okay?

44
00:04:16,625 --> 00:04:19,291
[MALLOY]
Dude, it's been a week.

45
00:04:19,375 --> 00:04:21,208
[CAYENNE] I wonder if
she's even still alive.

46
00:04:23,291 --> 00:04:24,458
[AMATA]
How's Zess?

47
00:04:24,541 --> 00:04:27,041
[SAZANKA]
Ehh. Taking another sick day...

48
00:04:27,125 --> 00:04:29,708
Whole thing's
really messing with her.

49
00:04:38,291 --> 00:04:40,333
It should've been me...

50
00:04:40,416 --> 00:04:43,125
I shouldn't be here... I...

51
00:04:44,458 --> 00:04:45,833
Damn you, Amata.

52
00:04:45,916 --> 00:04:48,458
What were you
thinking...? Why me?

53
00:04:50,125 --> 00:04:52,083
You would've gotten over it...

54
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:55,416
We all know who you
really can't live without.

55
00:05:02,416 --> 00:05:04,000
Oh, no. Not again...

56
00:05:07,125 --> 00:05:08,958
[MIKAGE]
Fear not, child.

57
00:05:09,041 --> 00:05:11,041
N-No...! Stay away!

58
00:05:13,375 --> 00:05:15,250
[MIKAGE]
Quell your tears.

59
00:05:18,916 --> 00:05:20,916
[MIKAGE]
I know what it is to be trapped

60
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,083
in the half-life of
those passed over.

61
00:05:24,166 --> 00:05:26,875
Wha...? What are
you talking about?

62
00:05:28,541 --> 00:05:31,666
Fate cut us from the
same cloth, my dear...

63
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:36,750
The hand of love caressed
our cheek, only to recoil...

64
00:05:36,833 --> 00:05:39,500
We are the Unchosen.

65
00:05:41,166 --> 00:05:43,666
What say you to my
tearing that hand asunder

66
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:49,125
and making of it a salve
to mend your tattered heart?

67
00:05:49,208 --> 00:05:51,833
I can open doors
for you, child...

68
00:05:51,916 --> 00:05:54,666
The precious
Dimension Gate, for example.

69
00:05:56,041 --> 00:05:57,208
Bear in mind...

70
00:05:57,291 --> 00:06:00,416
The price will be high.

71
00:06:23,916 --> 00:06:24,958
[AMATA]
C'mon, Mikono!

72
00:06:25,041 --> 00:06:26,583
Can't we at least
talk about this...?

73
00:06:26,666 --> 00:06:29,041
Where are you even
gonna start looking?

74
00:06:29,125 --> 00:06:30,333
[MIKONO]
I don't know...

75
00:06:30,416 --> 00:06:32,791
But it's up to me...
That's all there is to it.

76
00:06:34,833 --> 00:06:36,083
Mikono my dear...

77
00:06:36,166 --> 00:06:37,916
your power is to connect those

78
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
who've been divided
from themselves

79
00:06:40,083 --> 00:06:41,708
and make them whole once more.

80
00:06:41,791 --> 00:06:42,875
You must reach out to those

81
00:06:42,958 --> 00:06:45,041
too attached to
their old selves...

82
00:06:45,125 --> 00:06:48,250
nourish them on
their way to new life.

83
00:06:49,166 --> 00:06:51,500
You said yourself
we're all in this together.

84
00:06:51,583 --> 00:06:53,166
Now more than ever.

85
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:55,541
Well, this is my contribution.

86
00:06:55,625 --> 00:06:59,958
I connect people...
It's what I do... It's all I do.

87
00:07:00,041 --> 00:07:02,500
Mikono... Look, you can't
just tear off by yourself--

88
00:07:02,583 --> 00:07:03,541
Why not?

89
00:07:03,625 --> 00:07:05,375
What good am
I sitting around here?

90
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:07,208
I'm sorry, it's just...

91
00:07:07,291 --> 00:07:08,458
Look, if there's a chance

92
00:07:08,541 --> 00:07:10,916
he can bring us to Mix,
I've got to find him.

93
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,125
Then I'm going with you!

94
00:07:13,208 --> 00:07:14,041
[MIKONO]
Is that a fact...?

95
00:07:14,125 --> 00:07:15,291
Well what happens

96
00:07:15,375 --> 00:07:16,791
when the Abductors
come back, huh?

97
00:07:16,875 --> 00:07:18,166
We need you in the fray.

98
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:21,375
Not me. My power is
no use in battle...

99
00:07:21,458 --> 00:07:22,916
[AMATA]
But, Mikono...

100
00:07:23,833 --> 00:07:25,333
There's something...

101
00:07:25,416 --> 00:07:28,208
Something I've needed
to say to you for a while.

102
00:07:28,291 --> 00:07:29,583
I haven't, 'cause...

103
00:07:29,666 --> 00:07:32,958
Well, frankly
'cause I'm terrified...

104
00:07:33,041 --> 00:07:38,500
But if I can find Fudo...
I promise I'll tell you.

105
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:41,750
Hang on...! Wait, please!

106
00:07:50,916 --> 00:07:51,958
You're such a terror...

107
00:07:52,041 --> 00:07:53,958
Take it easy on
him once in a while.

108
00:07:57,875 --> 00:07:59,625
[YUNOHA] Sure is a
temperamental little thing...

109
00:07:59,708 --> 00:08:00,458
Wonder why it doesn't have

110
00:08:00,541 --> 00:08:02,250
a problem with Kagura.

111
00:08:02,333 --> 00:08:04,208
Just growls at everybody else...

112
00:08:04,291 --> 00:08:06,375
Seems a bit weird if you ask me.

113
00:08:06,458 --> 00:08:07,708
Yeah, well...

114
00:08:07,791 --> 00:08:09,333
He's cool with girls...

115
00:08:09,416 --> 00:08:10,541
Boys, on the other hand,

116
00:08:10,625 --> 00:08:12,791
he's all about giving
the third degree to.

117
00:08:13,375 --> 00:08:15,000
Especially if I like them...

118
00:08:15,083 --> 00:08:15,875
Guess he thinks of himself

119
00:08:15,958 --> 00:08:18,041
as the guardian of my virtue.

120
00:08:18,125 --> 00:08:19,500
So, I take that to mean...

121
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:23,000
you really do like
Amata, don'tcha?

122
00:08:28,791 --> 00:08:29,958
I'm sorry...

123
00:08:30,041 --> 00:08:32,125
If I were brave enough,
I would've told you...

124
00:08:32,208 --> 00:08:34,041
But when I think about Zess...

125
00:08:34,125 --> 00:08:37,333
How much it kills her
just to see us together...

126
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:39,416
Still, I owe you the truth...

127
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,208
Just let me find Fudo...

128
00:08:41,291 --> 00:08:45,041
When I get back, I'll tell
you... I promise, Amata.

129
00:08:53,791 --> 00:08:56,250
[EI] A Dimension Gate's opened
up directly over the Academy!

130
00:08:56,333 --> 00:08:57,250
Oh dear lord...

131
00:08:57,333 --> 00:08:59,208
They want a fight,
they'll get one!

132
00:09:01,083 --> 00:09:02,375
[ANDY]
The hell...?

133
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:10,291
Okay...

134
00:09:10,375 --> 00:09:11,500
What do you see?

135
00:09:11,583 --> 00:09:14,041
[CIERRO]
That's just it, sir... nobody.

136
00:09:14,125 --> 00:09:15,166
[ANDY]
What?

137
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:16,541
Look alive, people! This is it!

138
00:09:16,625 --> 00:09:17,583
Andy! Wha...?

139
00:09:17,666 --> 00:09:19,250
You gotta get me up
there, now...!

140
00:09:19,333 --> 00:09:21,458
This could be our only
chance of saving Mix!

141
00:09:21,541 --> 00:09:22,875
Cool yer jets, Andy...

142
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:24,458
The enemy's just baiting us.

143
00:09:24,541 --> 00:09:25,625
Seriously?

144
00:09:25,708 --> 00:09:27,958
I am in agreement
with Commander Donar...

145
00:09:28,041 --> 00:09:29,416
It's a trap.

146
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:32,166
The enemy lies in
ambush on the other side.

147
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:35,083
[MIKAGE]
Bear in mind...

148
00:09:35,166 --> 00:09:37,208
The price will be high.

149
00:09:40,041 --> 00:09:41,625
Zess, what's wrong?

150
00:09:41,708 --> 00:09:44,166
[CREA] In any event,
given Fudo's absence

151
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,125
we dare not send
our vanguard battalion

152
00:09:46,208 --> 00:09:49,500
willy-nilly across dimensions
into enemy territory.

153
00:09:49,583 --> 00:09:50,708
Oh, bullshit!

154
00:09:50,791 --> 00:09:52,416
You tellin' me we're
just gonna abandon her?!

155
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,916
I know she means
the world to you, Andy...

156
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,041
I'm sorry.

157
00:09:56,125 --> 00:09:57,333
So, that's it, huh...?

158
00:09:57,416 --> 00:10:00,041
We're just gonna sit here
and do jack squat...

159
00:10:00,125 --> 00:10:02,166
Pardon, Miss Chairwoman.

160
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:06,083
Commander...? Or...
Chief Instructor...?

161
00:10:06,166 --> 00:10:08,333
Compliments of
High Commander Fudo.

162
00:10:08,416 --> 00:10:10,708
He asks that it be
opened immediately, ma'am.

163
00:10:14,416 --> 00:10:15,708
A donut.

164
00:10:16,625 --> 00:10:18,541
[SUOMI]
That's disgusting!

165
00:10:18,625 --> 00:10:20,166
[DONAR]
What... the hell?

166
00:10:22,791 --> 00:10:24,541
[AMATA]
That's weird...

167
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:25,708
[CREA]
Wait.

168
00:10:31,625 --> 00:10:33,708
Zen must intend this as a sign.

169
00:10:33,791 --> 00:10:34,958
What?

170
00:10:35,041 --> 00:10:37,416
Perhaps he is
encouraging us to infiltrate.

171
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:38,750
What, with a donut?

172
00:10:38,833 --> 00:10:40,458
They've burrowed quite deep...

173
00:10:40,541 --> 00:10:41,791
So deep that the inside

174
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:43,583
and outside have become as one.

175
00:10:43,666 --> 00:10:45,166
Yeah, but what does that mean?

176
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:47,875
He means the gate!

177
00:10:49,041 --> 00:10:53,208
We will take this as a
direct order...! Vectors!

178
00:10:53,291 --> 00:10:55,208
Deploy to Altair at once!

179
00:10:55,291 --> 00:10:56,416
[CADETS]
Roger!

180
00:10:57,916 --> 00:11:00,250
[MIKAGE] Step through the
looking glass, my pets...

181
00:11:00,333 --> 00:11:01,750
The way is clear;

182
00:11:01,833 --> 00:11:05,375
a nightmare of longing
and regret awaits.

183
00:11:05,458 --> 00:11:07,416
Thank she with tresses

184
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,708
like emerald seed-plumes...

185
00:11:09,791 --> 00:11:12,708
Whose debt,
in time, will be sown.

186
00:11:14,125 --> 00:11:15,583
Patience, Kagura.

187
00:11:15,666 --> 00:11:18,916
You moment shall come... Soon.

188
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:24,666
[CAYENNE]
Vector Y. All systems green.

189
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:27,333
Awaiting permission to launch.

190
00:11:30,416 --> 00:11:31,708
I'm sorry...

191
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:34,166
I only hope you can
one day forgive me...

192
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:35,791
I truly do.

193
00:11:39,208 --> 00:11:40,166
Cayenne?

194
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:42,875
Then who's... piloting Vector Y?

195
00:11:43,375 --> 00:11:46,208
Shrade Elan...
Ready for deployment!

196
00:11:47,333 --> 00:11:49,250
Shrade, come back!

197
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:52,916
The strains of an alien
music beg to be absorbed.

198
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,208
My magnum opus demands it...

199
00:11:55,291 --> 00:11:57,291
My soul demands it.

200
00:11:58,125 --> 00:11:59,750
Girls-- don't get upset

201
00:11:59,833 --> 00:12:00,833
if I don't merge with you...

202
00:12:00,916 --> 00:12:02,083
I'm saving it...

203
00:12:02,166 --> 00:12:04,583
I want my first
time to be special.

204
00:12:04,666 --> 00:12:07,458
That right...! Mix and me!

205
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:15,416
Infiltration Merge...!
Go... Aquarion!

206
00:12:20,583 --> 00:12:23,333
[EVOL]
Aquarion Evol!

207
00:12:35,291 --> 00:12:36,708
[ATTENDANT] The new recruit's
mind will need time

208
00:12:36,791 --> 00:12:39,958
to stabilize, of course,
but so far so good.

209
00:12:40,041 --> 00:12:42,208
I'm ecstatic the
specimen remained

210
00:12:42,291 --> 00:12:43,791
as intact as it did...

211
00:12:43,875 --> 00:12:47,208
Not an ideal situation,
alas, but still...

212
00:12:47,291 --> 00:12:49,916
Indeed... Perhaps
it's a hopeful sign.

213
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,333
Jin is irreplaceable...
But at the very least we now

214
00:12:52,416 --> 00:12:54,708
have a pilot to help
flesh out the ranks.

215
00:12:54,791 --> 00:12:56,750
[TECH B] Izumo, sir...!
The Dimension Gate has opened!

216
00:12:56,833 --> 00:12:58,583
[IZUMO]
It's what...?!

217
00:12:58,666 --> 00:13:00,875
Damn it, Mikage
is up to something!

218
00:13:00,958 --> 00:13:03,250
He knows precisely
how much energy

219
00:13:03,333 --> 00:13:06,458
is required to pry the gate
wide enough for transport...

220
00:13:06,541 --> 00:13:08,500
Every time it's opened,
the entropy

221
00:13:08,583 --> 00:13:11,333
of Altair's dwindling
resources is hastened...

222
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:13,041
Does he not care?

223
00:13:19,291 --> 00:13:22,000
[TECH B] Something came
through...! Check again!

224
00:13:22,083 --> 00:13:24,125
[TECH D]
Nothing... No heat signature...

225
00:13:24,208 --> 00:13:26,458
[TECH C]
No mass detected either, sir.

226
00:13:26,541 --> 00:13:28,041
[TECH B]
Impossible...

227
00:13:28,125 --> 00:13:30,625
Why else would the
Gate have opened?

228
00:13:40,125 --> 00:13:42,250
[AMATA] Hang in there, Yunoha.
Just a bit longer.

229
00:13:42,333 --> 00:13:44,291
Uh... Okay.

230
00:13:44,375 --> 00:13:45,958
[ZESSICA] Is it me, or is
this place a dump?

231
00:13:46,041 --> 00:13:47,666
[ANDY]
No kidding, right?

232
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:50,791
It's like... Damn...
I dunno: wall-to-wall rust.

233
00:13:50,875 --> 00:13:52,708
[SHRADE]
There's the chink in the armor.

234
00:13:59,833 --> 00:14:03,625
Holy crap... Those are all
headstones.

235
00:14:17,916 --> 00:14:19,666
Whoa! Easy!

236
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:20,666
Are you all right?

237
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:22,625
Yeah... But...

238
00:14:22,708 --> 00:14:24,166
Best case,
I'm only gonna be able

239
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:26,791
to keep them
camouflaged for half a day...

240
00:14:26,875 --> 00:14:29,750
We need to find Mix
and get out of here fast.

241
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:33,750
I thought to hear
music... Instead...

242
00:14:33,833 --> 00:14:36,833
I, hear a planet in
the throes of death.

243
00:14:43,166 --> 00:14:46,916
Gah, slow down! Arrive alive--

244
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,166
I'm coming, Mix...!

245
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:50,458
Andy's en route to get
ya the hell outta here!

246
00:14:50,541 --> 00:14:51,916
You know, it'd have
probably been safer

247
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,791
for you to stay
with the vectors.

248
00:14:53,875 --> 00:14:55,583
Yeahhhh... I know.

249
00:14:55,666 --> 00:14:58,625
But I wanted to see
where Jin came from...

250
00:14:58,708 --> 00:15:00,333
He'd want me to.

251
00:15:11,125 --> 00:15:14,208
[ANDY] Alicia? That's
Flight of the Aquaria!

252
00:15:15,208 --> 00:15:15,916
[ZESSICA]
What are the chances

253
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,083
they'd be showing it here?

254
00:15:18,166 --> 00:15:20,250
Must be popular on this world...

255
00:15:20,333 --> 00:15:22,458
Like on Jin's hologram thing...

256
00:15:22,541 --> 00:15:25,500
I get the feeling images
of Alicia are pretty common.

257
00:15:25,583 --> 00:15:32,625
[AMATA] So... My mom's
a star on two planets?

258
00:15:32,708 --> 00:15:35,375
[BUM A] Nice! Paid through
the nose for that, eh?

259
00:15:35,458 --> 00:15:38,500
Hard to find one in color.

260
00:15:39,875 --> 00:15:41,833
What's with
the spacesuit, kid...?

261
00:15:41,916 --> 00:15:44,666
You like playin'
cosmonaut or somethin'?

262
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:46,583
I got this... Stay back.

263
00:15:46,666 --> 00:15:50,291
You look like an
Igura in that get-up.

264
00:15:50,375 --> 00:15:52,583
These front
pouches ain't helpin'.

265
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:55,708
Hands off!

266
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:58,375
You okay?!

267
00:15:58,458 --> 00:15:59,875
You believe this guy?

268
00:15:59,958 --> 00:16:02,833
I would suggest we...
dress more discreetly...

269
00:16:02,916 --> 00:16:06,458
These, gentlemen might
be persuaded to help us.

270
00:16:16,791 --> 00:16:18,500
Smells like a septic tank.

271
00:16:18,583 --> 00:16:20,500
Just try to keep
your mind off it.

272
00:16:20,583 --> 00:16:22,708
That's not the only thing...

273
00:16:22,791 --> 00:16:25,208
Anybody else picking
up on the obvious?

274
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:31,125
Indeed...

275
00:16:31,208 --> 00:16:34,541
The city appears to be populated
only by males... Huh...

276
00:16:34,625 --> 00:16:36,625
Perhaps the entire
planet's that way.

277
00:16:36,708 --> 00:16:38,208
Whoa... Dude.

278
00:16:38,291 --> 00:16:41,041
That would explain why
they're after Vega's women.

279
00:16:42,416 --> 00:16:44,083
Zessica, what's the matter?

280
00:16:44,166 --> 00:16:46,208
I've been feeling like
I'm coming down

281
00:16:46,291 --> 00:16:49,500
with something pretty much
since we landed on this rock.

282
00:16:49,583 --> 00:16:51,375
Hey, so have I, actually...

283
00:16:51,458 --> 00:16:54,375
It's almost like there's
something in the air...

284
00:16:54,458 --> 00:16:57,416
I think you're right.

285
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:59,541
[ANDY]
Jackpot.

286
00:16:59,625 --> 00:17:01,000
[YUNOHA]
Yeah, that's the place...

287
00:17:01,083 --> 00:17:03,875
Jin's data spread
keeps linking back to it.

288
00:17:03,958 --> 00:17:06,000
[ANDY]
Got it, Bad Guy Central.

289
00:17:06,375 --> 00:17:07,625
[AMATA]
Question is...

290
00:17:07,708 --> 00:17:10,291
How do we know
Mix is even in there?

291
00:17:10,375 --> 00:17:13,708
Easy, we do a little re-con.

292
00:17:13,791 --> 00:17:15,083
Right.

293
00:17:23,416 --> 00:17:24,166
[ZESSICA]
Damn.

294
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:25,333
[AMATA]
Nice, Andy...

295
00:17:25,416 --> 00:17:27,375
Talk about kickin' ass and
taking names.

296
00:17:27,458 --> 00:17:29,458
Dude, wait up!

297
00:17:29,541 --> 00:17:31,625
[ANNOUCER] Intruders detected
in Hanger Nineteen...!

298
00:17:31,708 --> 00:17:34,958
All units to Phase One
battle stations immediately!

299
00:17:35,041 --> 00:17:36,166
[SECURITY A]
We have reason

300
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:38,375
to believe the
bastards are from Vega.

301
00:17:38,458 --> 00:17:39,750
That's right, men:

302
00:17:39,833 --> 00:17:42,791
we've got ourselves a tangle
with alien life forms...

303
00:17:42,875 --> 00:17:44,208
I know you're
fresh out of training,

304
00:17:44,291 --> 00:17:46,083
but this is the hand
you've been dealt.

305
00:17:46,166 --> 00:17:48,083
Stay alert, stay focused--

306
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:49,958
Don't move!

307
00:17:54,083 --> 00:17:55,583
Wrong... choice... losers!

308
00:17:56,875 --> 00:17:58,083
Bastard!

309
00:17:58,166 --> 00:18:00,750
Unless you wanna end up
like your comrades...

310
00:18:00,833 --> 00:18:02,000
I suggest you to
whatever it takes

311
00:18:02,083 --> 00:18:03,708
to keep from pissin' me off!

312
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:07,000
Now listen up, buck-o...
'cause here's the deal:

313
00:18:07,083 --> 00:18:08,625
We wanna tour guide...

314
00:18:08,708 --> 00:18:10,083
You wanna live.

315
00:18:10,166 --> 00:18:12,416
Think we can scratch
each other's backs?

316
00:18:17,625 --> 00:18:19,041
There they are!

317
00:18:20,166 --> 00:18:21,000
Son of a...!

318
00:18:27,041 --> 00:18:28,250
Let's rearrange the plan...

319
00:18:28,333 --> 00:18:30,041
The guys will stay
and hold them off.

320
00:18:30,125 --> 00:18:31,750
Ladies, you find Mix.

Especially you, Amata...
Don't get dead.

No stone unturned!

Be careful.

Such a crude,
percussive cacophony...
