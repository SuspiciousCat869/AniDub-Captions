1
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,666
I can't abide that noise.

2
00:01:03,625 --> 00:01:05,708
Such unfathomable power.

3
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:15,208
Could he really be
the one? This boy?

4
00:01:15,291 --> 00:01:16,833
Boy?

5
00:01:20,875 --> 00:01:23,375
Mikage, what are you doing here?

6
00:01:23,458 --> 00:01:25,166
This "boy" you speak of.

7
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:28,916
My curiosity is
piqued. Indulge me.

8
00:01:30,666 --> 00:01:34,291
Very well, I shall
speak for you.

9
00:01:34,375 --> 00:01:37,458
He is the angel's chevalier;
the secret spring

10
00:01:37,541 --> 00:01:39,916
from whence the
enemy's power flows.

11
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,458
He whose eyes mint
gold, whose wild auburn locks

12
00:01:43,541 --> 00:01:46,500
flutter like a tattered
ensign on the wind.

13
00:01:46,583 --> 00:01:47,958
You know him.

14
00:01:48,041 --> 00:01:51,000
Your soul-sick heart
aches at the sight of him;

15
00:01:51,083 --> 00:01:53,958
this lambent echo
of our sleeping Eve.

16
00:03:33,875 --> 00:03:36,333
The fairer sex
has long departed.

17
00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:40,750
And we, Altair's sad detritus,
limn the edge of extinction.

18
00:03:40,833 --> 00:03:42,750
Thus we plumbed Vega.

19
00:03:42,833 --> 00:03:45,666
Thus we dared let a
sister world give hope.

20
00:03:47,708 --> 00:03:49,000
Iguras.

21
00:03:49,083 --> 00:03:52,166
Women of rare substance
from across time and space;

22
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:56,125
a hardy stock impervious to
the ravages of this barren land.

23
00:03:56,208 --> 00:03:57,958
We sought them at great cost,

24
00:03:58,041 --> 00:04:01,375
desperate to infuse our
garden once again with life.

25
00:04:01,458 --> 00:04:06,916
Before you, Alicia; the supine
asphodel, the one True Eve.

26
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,750
Our hope manifest.

27
00:04:10,666 --> 00:04:12,625
Yet her sojourn 'cross
the ineffable barrier

28
00:04:12,708 --> 00:04:15,000
twixt worlds
leeched her vitality,

29
00:04:15,083 --> 00:04:17,750
cast her into a deep,
death-like sleep.

30
00:04:17,833 --> 00:04:19,625
Our hope extinguished.

31
00:04:19,708 --> 00:04:22,041
Banishment from Eden complete.

32
00:04:23,916 --> 00:04:26,208
On Vega, she bore a child.

33
00:04:26,291 --> 00:04:28,625
When we came for her,
the child was discarded,

34
00:04:28,708 --> 00:04:31,875
perhaps in an effort to shield
it from the mother's fate.

35
00:04:33,083 --> 00:04:35,958
Not that any of this
matters now, of course.

36
00:04:36,041 --> 00:04:40,000
Alicia is but a fragile
doll for you to pine over.

37
00:04:40,083 --> 00:04:43,708
She is condemned to sleep,
and this world, to death.

38
00:04:43,791 --> 00:04:46,333
Yet in search of
comfort you fill your eyes

39
00:04:46,416 --> 00:04:47,500
with the sad sight of her.

40
00:04:47,583 --> 00:04:49,083
Irony of ironies.

41
00:04:49,166 --> 00:04:51,166
You know nothing of Alicia.

42
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:53,791
It truly is pathetic to behold.

43
00:04:53,875 --> 00:04:55,958
This fiction that you cling to.

44
00:04:56,041 --> 00:05:00,458
Tis but a contentious mirage,
an infantile fantasy.

45
00:05:02,708 --> 00:05:04,041
Let us be done with it.

46
00:05:04,125 --> 00:05:07,125
Banish the dream as the
reality banishes you.

47
00:05:09,875 --> 00:05:11,583
Damn you!

48
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:21,916
You will not lay a hand
on her. You understand me?!

49
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,250
Alas, all dreamers'
needs must awaken.

50
00:05:25,333 --> 00:05:27,958
All mirages give
way to the source.

51
00:05:28,583 --> 00:05:31,708
Jin has infiltrated the
homebase of the Machine Angel.

52
00:05:31,791 --> 00:05:33,458
What we've been working so hard

53
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:35,708
for is finally within our grasp.

54
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:42,916
Consider the butterfly.

55
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,041
On Vega, they are a symbol
of rebirth, renewed purpose,

56
00:05:48,125 --> 00:05:49,958
the promise of life.

57
00:05:50,041 --> 00:05:52,750
Perhaps love shall again
play the forbidden strain.

58
00:05:52,833 --> 00:05:55,416
The old curse find purchase.

59
00:06:06,583 --> 00:06:08,333
Dear Kagura.

60
00:06:11,416 --> 00:06:15,291
Such. A. Beast. You. Are.

61
00:06:22,208 --> 00:06:26,458
Exquisite child.
That's right, feel it.

62
00:06:26,541 --> 00:06:29,833
Let it uncoil in your
bowels like a serpent.

63
00:06:29,916 --> 00:06:32,250
The past writhes
to be unfettered!

64
00:06:32,333 --> 00:06:35,666
Every searing piece of it,
every venomous ember.

65
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:40,250
Yes. Apollon and Silvie;
their betrayal,

66
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:43,166
their reckless
inconstancy--remember!

67
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:51,250
Even now, Silvie sidles
close to your heart,

68
00:06:51,333 --> 00:06:52,875
doesn't she, my boy?

69
00:06:52,958 --> 00:06:55,000
You can still hear
the delicate sigh;

70
00:06:55,083 --> 00:06:58,333
the voice so sweet it could
lull the angels to sleep.

71
00:06:58,416 --> 00:07:02,083
She could bring bliss
to the heavens themselves.

72
00:07:03,958 --> 00:07:07,375
Her beauty could charm death
itself to relax its grip,

73
00:07:07,458 --> 00:07:09,625
her soulful warmth
coax a glacier;

74
00:07:09,708 --> 00:07:12,625
she is the very memory of love.

75
00:07:12,708 --> 00:07:15,583
You burn to know that
love, don't you, child?

76
00:07:15,666 --> 00:07:17,250
You are mad for it.

77
00:07:17,333 --> 00:07:18,833
You would breathe
deep the sweetness

78
00:07:18,916 --> 00:07:21,833
of her bouquet and
claim it for your own.

79
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:26,666
More. You have to want it more.

80
00:07:29,083 --> 00:07:30,708
Don't stop!

81
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:37,708
Yes, that's it.

82
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:42,291
Howl, you hungry beast.
Howl for love!

83
00:07:52,083 --> 00:07:54,875
Yes. Magnificent creature.

84
00:07:54,958 --> 00:07:57,041
Follow that implacable nose.

85
00:07:57,125 --> 00:08:00,250
Seek out the answer
to this desperate hunger.

86
00:08:43,375 --> 00:08:44,666
What the hell?

87
00:08:50,583 --> 00:08:52,083
Izumo.

88
00:08:52,166 --> 00:08:54,625
There's something
important you should know.

89
00:08:54,708 --> 00:08:56,750
Whether or not the
Rare Iguras fulfill

90
00:08:56,833 --> 00:09:00,041
their purpose is
of no concern to me.

91
00:09:00,125 --> 00:09:04,250
Altair's needs
and my own diverge.

92
00:09:04,333 --> 00:09:08,208
I want only my angel to
rise from the ashes of Vega.

93
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,958
Hey, you, whoever you are.

94
00:09:22,041 --> 00:09:26,250
Remember this.
I'll never trust you,

95
00:09:26,333 --> 00:09:29,750
and there's not a damn thing
you can do to change that.

96
00:09:30,875 --> 00:09:33,041
If you ever try anything
like that again,

97
00:09:33,125 --> 00:09:35,791
I'll be coming after you myself.

98
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:47,125
What was that power?
Where did it come from?

99
00:09:52,791 --> 00:09:56,208
Mister Batbayar, you're
released. Come on out.

100
00:09:57,625 --> 00:09:58,666
Sneak into the
girls' dorm again,

101
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:01,125
and there will be
dire consequences.

102
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:03,583
Cayenne, You know better than

103
00:10:03,666 --> 00:10:05,750
to aim a gun at your classmates.

104
00:10:05,833 --> 00:10:06,833
I'm leaving you in there

105
00:10:06,916 --> 00:10:09,041
so you can think
about what you've done.

106
00:10:11,958 --> 00:10:13,208
What's this?

107
00:10:13,291 --> 00:10:17,333
Well, um, You like Alicia.
So I made this outfit.

108
00:10:18,416 --> 00:10:19,916
That's your idea of her?

109
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,583
I know--it's not perfect. Sorry.

110
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:26,125
But The face is good right?

111
00:10:27,875 --> 00:10:30,291
Oh, not so much, I guess.

112
00:10:35,541 --> 00:10:37,916
Somebody forgot their manners.

113
00:10:41,958 --> 00:10:44,458
Akbarjin Batbayar isn't
who he says he is.

114
00:10:44,541 --> 00:10:46,500
He's an impostor!

115
00:10:48,291 --> 00:10:50,291
I fail to see what
the problem is.

116
00:10:50,375 --> 00:10:51,875
What?

117
00:10:51,958 --> 00:10:54,416
He did pass Neo-DEAVA's
entrance exams

118
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:56,833
with exemplary marks,
did he not?

119
00:10:56,916 --> 00:10:58,041
But--

120
00:10:58,125 --> 00:11:00,000
I believe what the
situation calls for--

121
00:11:00,083 --> 00:11:02,083
Is isolation.

122
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:10,875
Didn't Yunoha say she gets
what Jin's going through?

123
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:13,833
Granted there's a lot
we don't know about him,

124
00:11:13,916 --> 00:11:16,750
but he doesn't seem
like all that bad of a guy.

125
00:11:16,833 --> 00:11:19,083
It wouldn't hurt
to get to know him.

126
00:11:19,166 --> 00:11:21,500
I mean, how else you gonna know
where he's coming from, right?

127
00:11:21,583 --> 00:11:25,208
Yeah, that makes sense.
I suppose you're right.

128
00:11:30,875 --> 00:11:34,666
Mikono, I-I have to know...

129
00:11:35,375 --> 00:11:37,583
I want to know. So badly.

130
00:11:37,666 --> 00:11:39,500
I just have to ask.

131
00:11:39,583 --> 00:11:41,125
About him.

132
00:11:41,208 --> 00:11:42,875
About that man.

133
00:11:42,958 --> 00:11:45,625
His eyes looked so desperate.

134
00:11:45,708 --> 00:11:48,666
You hafta forgive him. For what?

135
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:52,250
They were sad. Like a lost dog.

136
00:11:52,333 --> 00:11:53,875
Sorry we're late, peeps!

137
00:11:54,708 --> 00:11:57,375
Man, you wouldn't
believe those damn lines.

138
00:11:57,458 --> 00:11:59,583
Hey, what's the
deal with you two

139
00:11:59,666 --> 00:12:02,875
sitting together all
mopey like this, huh?

140
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:05,625
Nothing.

141
00:12:06,583 --> 00:12:08,375
I forgot my juice.

142
00:12:13,583 --> 00:12:15,166
Hey, can I have a sip?

143
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:20,500
Indecent!

144
00:12:20,583 --> 00:12:22,958
Whoa, that's like
an indirect kiss!

145
00:12:24,708 --> 00:12:26,208
An indirect kiss?!

146
00:12:27,041 --> 00:12:28,791
Hey, can I have a
sip of yours too?

147
00:12:28,875 --> 00:12:32,458
Oh, uh. Why not?

148
00:12:34,458 --> 00:12:35,875
Wow, Zessica.

149
00:12:35,958 --> 00:12:38,333
You've had a lil' taste of
just about everybody's juice.

150
00:12:44,791 --> 00:12:45,583
You all right?

151
00:12:45,666 --> 00:12:46,625
Yeah, I'm good.

152
00:12:46,708 --> 00:12:48,083
Something's out there!

153
00:12:56,958 --> 00:12:58,125
Kagura?

154
00:12:59,083 --> 00:13:02,166
Close the gate now!
On the double!

155
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:04,583
We cannot let him get to Vega!

156
00:13:07,666 --> 00:13:09,958
Ah, pretty beast.

157
00:13:10,041 --> 00:13:13,125
A flower for the
arduous journey ahead.

158
00:13:13,208 --> 00:13:16,208
You will, I think,
come to need it.

159
00:13:16,291 --> 00:13:18,958
Let us pray the gold your eyes
mint scorches an object lesson

160
00:13:19,041 --> 00:13:22,250
into the heart of
my beautiful angel.

161
00:13:28,458 --> 00:13:30,791
At last, the time has come.

162
00:13:37,458 --> 00:13:38,625
Seriously.

163
00:13:38,708 --> 00:13:40,208
I don't care if you're
so parched you crackle;

164
00:13:40,291 --> 00:13:43,625
a lady simply does not act like
that in front of other people.

165
00:13:43,708 --> 00:13:46,125
If you don't wanna go thirsty,
then bring your own drink.

166
00:13:46,208 --> 00:13:46,958
Got it?

167
00:13:47,041 --> 00:13:48,375
Jus' mind your own business.

168
00:13:48,458 --> 00:13:49,791
You're my friend,

169
00:13:49,875 --> 00:13:52,208
safeguarding what's left
of your rep is my business.

170
00:13:52,291 --> 00:13:55,041
So do yourself a favor
next time, and think first.

171
00:13:56,166 --> 00:13:57,916
Hey, where are you going?

172
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,291
Back to the girl's dorms.

173
00:14:01,375 --> 00:14:03,750
But, don't you have
afternoon classes to attend?!

174
00:14:03,833 --> 00:14:06,291
Zessica, hang on!

175
00:14:06,375 --> 00:14:09,166
See, look. I tried
to stitch it evenly.

176
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:11,500
Unfortunately, it didn't
work out too well.

177
00:14:11,583 --> 00:14:13,708
I'm not very good at this stuff.

178
00:14:13,791 --> 00:14:16,625
Aww man. This is so bittersweet!

179
00:14:16,708 --> 00:14:17,875
What a beat down!

180
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:19,375
I think it's kinda awesome.

181
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:22,041
More than anything, I just
hope Jin opens up to her.

182
00:14:22,125 --> 00:14:24,875
So what, you think this
isn't going to affect you?!

183
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:27,875
Listen dude, the ladies
are always thirsty for love;

184
00:14:27,958 --> 00:14:29,666
I mean it's how they're wired.

185
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:32,333
Did you already forget what
happened with Zess at lunch?

186
00:14:32,416 --> 00:14:34,666
What are you trying to say?

187
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:37,541
If you really want it,
bro, dig deep.

188
00:14:37,625 --> 00:14:40,958
Bore a well into
Mikono's heart. Get it?

189
00:14:41,625 --> 00:14:43,375
A well into her heart...

190
00:14:48,916 --> 00:14:50,791
Too much is in the way.

191
00:14:50,875 --> 00:14:52,250
Love's not allowed, remember?

192
00:14:52,333 --> 00:14:54,333
For now, yeah.
But once this dumb war

193
00:14:54,416 --> 00:14:57,000
with the Abductors is
over, it's open season.

194
00:14:57,083 --> 00:14:59,458
You better lock
her down and fast.

195
00:14:59,541 --> 00:15:00,625
Lock her down?

196
00:15:00,708 --> 00:15:02,958
Look: Mikono's way
hotter than you, dude.

197
00:15:03,041 --> 00:15:04,333
If you dilly-dally for too long,

198
00:15:04,416 --> 00:15:07,375
some choad's gonna get
his talons in 'er and boom.

199
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:20,791
Uh hey, Mikono.
Can we uh-- can we talk?

200
00:15:20,875 --> 00:15:22,416
Uh, okay.

201
00:15:22,791 --> 00:15:24,875
Yo! I didn't mean now!

202
00:15:25,875 --> 00:15:26,833
I knew there was a reason

203
00:15:26,916 --> 00:15:28,833
I made the guy
my hole digging bro.

204
00:15:28,916 --> 00:15:31,166
Do it like it's your job, Red.

205
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,208
No!

206
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:41,958
Kagura!

207
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:44,333
You have lost your
senses completely.

208
00:15:44,416 --> 00:15:46,458
You are forbidden
to travel to Vega!

209
00:15:46,541 --> 00:15:49,041
Go to Hell!

210
00:16:00,375 --> 00:16:01,708
Kagura! Get out of the Mithra

211
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:04,291
and go back to base or
we will take you out!

212
00:16:04,375 --> 00:16:06,000
Fuck you!

213
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:12,083
Stay out of my way
or you're all dead!

214
00:16:15,958 --> 00:16:17,916
You decrepit son of a bitch.

215
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,750
The way I see it you
have two options here.

216
00:16:20,833 --> 00:16:25,958
Open the gate or I smash
the Ianthe. Understood?!

217
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:32,291
Men, we're under attack.

218
00:16:32,375 --> 00:16:33,500
All pilots report

219
00:16:33,583 --> 00:16:35,250
to battle stations for
defensive protocols.

220
00:16:35,333 --> 00:16:36,291
I don't believe it.

221
00:16:36,375 --> 00:16:38,125
His strength has
become otherworldly.

222
00:16:38,208 --> 00:16:40,458
What in the hell
gave him such a spike?

223
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:46,541
Blooms out of season.
But falls in a blink.

224
00:16:46,625 --> 00:16:49,875
Such a flower is
the Kagura camellia.

225
00:16:51,083 --> 00:16:53,958
Do we have an
accord now, old friend?

226
00:16:54,041 --> 00:16:57,791
What I have done with this
life, I have done for love.

227
00:17:13,125 --> 00:17:14,666
What the hell?

228
00:17:16,708 --> 00:17:19,208
Sir! All units have
cleared the line of fire!

229
00:17:19,291 --> 00:17:20,458
Awaiting orders!

230
00:17:20,541 --> 00:17:22,791
Take the bastard out.

231
00:17:34,416 --> 00:17:37,666
She's mine! She's mine!

232
00:17:46,666 --> 00:17:51,208
Dear, fervent boy.
Does love not burn?

233
00:18:15,958 --> 00:18:18,291
What does Mikono
have that I don't?

234
00:18:18,375 --> 00:18:21,291
I know she's a total
knockout, but still.

235
00:18:30,416 --> 00:18:31,958
Apollon.

236
00:18:32,333 --> 00:18:33,625
Silvie.

237
00:18:37,041 --> 00:18:38,708
Silvie.

238
00:18:50,125 --> 00:18:52,916
Mikono? Something wrong?

239
00:18:54,083 --> 00:18:56,125
So, what did you
want to talk about?

240
00:18:56,208 --> 00:18:59,125
Um. Well, I...

241
00:18:59,208 --> 00:19:00,625
Yeah?

242
00:19:00,708 --> 00:19:03,708
It's about... that guy.

243
00:19:03,791 --> 00:19:05,708
Lock her down and fast.

244
00:19:05,791 --> 00:19:08,208
No! Wait! It's not like that!

245
00:19:08,291 --> 00:19:10,083
Like what?

246
00:19:10,166 --> 00:19:12,541
No! Ignore me, that
isn't what I meant!

247
00:19:12,625 --> 00:19:16,416
See, the thing is, I-I, uh--

248
00:19:19,208 --> 00:19:20,333
Oh crap!

249
00:19:20,416 --> 00:19:21,416
What's the matter?

250
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:24,666
Uh, sorry.
Could you look over there?

251
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:27,625
Just for a second, don't
look at me. Pretty please?!

252
00:19:33,291 --> 00:19:40,041
Umm, so... not right now,
but eventually, uh...

253
00:19:40,125 --> 00:19:41,541
Yeah?

254
00:19:41,625 --> 00:19:44,750
After this whole thing with
the Abductors is done with.

255
00:19:44,833 --> 00:19:48,458
Would you-- would you want to--

256
00:20:03,291 --> 00:20:06,458
Howl for me, beast.
Let it ring out.

257
00:20:06,541 --> 00:20:09,541
Absence from those
we love is self from self;

258
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:13,583
a deadly banishment.
But all is not lost.

259
00:20:13,666 --> 00:20:16,791
A howl may yet turn
the tide in your favor.

260
00:20:18,708 --> 00:20:22,166
Yes, you have
the gift of reversal.

261
00:20:35,625 --> 00:20:37,666
It's so cold.

262
00:20:38,291 --> 00:20:41,291
I feel their attacks. Like ice.

263
00:20:59,166 --> 00:21:00,375
Hold still, Kagura!

264
00:21:04,625 --> 00:21:06,041
It reeks.

265
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:11,083
I'm sick of this.
I want her dead.

266
00:21:12,458 --> 00:21:15,291
I want to take her in my arms.

267
00:21:15,375 --> 00:21:16,958
Squeeze her.

268
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:21,375
And crush her to dust.

269
00:21:24,291 --> 00:21:25,916
I'm coming for you.

270
00:21:27,875 --> 00:21:31,416
Silvie!

271
00:21:40,625 --> 00:21:42,250
Good show.

272
00:21:45,791 --> 00:21:48,791
What I'm saying is,
would you...?

273
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:56,708
Are you alright?

274
00:22:10,125 --> 00:22:12,625
What is this crazy power?

275
00:22:13,166 --> 00:22:16,416
Mikage! This is
your doing, monster!

276
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:19,333
As soon kindle fire with snow,

277
00:22:19,416 --> 00:22:22,000
as seek to quench the
flames of love with words.

278
00:22:22,083 --> 00:22:24,833
Our boy is merely
answering his hunger.

279
00:22:38,833 --> 00:22:43,208
Fly, Kagura. Rain hell
upon that which burns you.

280
00:22:43,291 --> 00:22:46,375
Journey to the
Holy Land of Love!

281
00:24:23,125 --> 00:24:24,500
That day at the movies,

282
00:24:24,583 --> 00:24:28,166
when I saw your face, I took
flight for the first time.

283
00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:29,833
I've been soaring ever since,

284
00:24:29,916 --> 00:24:31,958
and my feet have barely
touched the ground.

285
00:24:32,041 --> 00:24:33,916
I think I'm in love!

286
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,291
Next time: "Skies of Aquaria."
