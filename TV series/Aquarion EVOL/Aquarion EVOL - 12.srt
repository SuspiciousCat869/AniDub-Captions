1
00:00:25,708 --> 00:00:27,291
Hey. Got a sec?

2
00:00:32,916 --> 00:00:35,166
Hope you saved room for dessert.

3
00:00:37,291 --> 00:00:39,083
You've got to be joking.

4
00:00:39,166 --> 00:00:41,333
Oh, go on, don't be shy.

5
00:00:41,416 --> 00:00:43,000
Oh, sure.

6
00:00:43,375 --> 00:00:46,750
How 'bout this one, this one,
this one, and this one.

7
00:00:46,833 --> 00:00:48,583
Quite the appetite, huh?

8
00:00:48,666 --> 00:00:51,708
Don't look at me like that,
they're for research!

9
00:00:51,791 --> 00:00:52,750
Research?

10
00:00:52,833 --> 00:00:56,125
Never mind!
How much do I owe you?

11
00:00:56,208 --> 00:00:59,875
Yeah, see, about that.
I propose a trade.

12
00:01:00,625 --> 00:01:02,708
Make love to zee
camera n' we're square.

13
00:01:02,791 --> 00:01:04,333
Not a good idea!

14
00:01:04,416 --> 00:01:06,125
Oh, I beg to differ.

15
00:01:06,208 --> 00:01:07,708
Pics of the mysterious
exchange student

16
00:01:07,791 --> 00:01:10,666
are virtually legal
tender in the gal's dorm.

17
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:13,375
I'll pay big for one
of him with the hot dog!

18
00:01:13,458 --> 00:01:14,625
Ho-ho, yeah!

19
00:01:14,708 --> 00:01:16,208
Awesome!

20
00:01:17,375 --> 00:01:22,125
And here comes the Vector!
Nom, nom, nom!

21
00:01:28,208 --> 00:01:30,291
That's one way to
make friends, I suppose.

22
00:03:05,666 --> 00:03:06,875
You're killin' me.

23
00:03:06,958 --> 00:03:09,708
So she still doesn't
have a clue?

24
00:03:09,791 --> 00:03:11,375
No.

25
00:03:11,875 --> 00:03:13,833
Time to carpe the diem!

26
00:03:13,916 --> 00:03:15,541
Sounds like mama bird
Andy's gonna have

27
00:03:15,625 --> 00:03:17,000
to kick you outta the nest.

28
00:03:17,083 --> 00:03:19,291
Or, down a nice, big hole.

29
00:03:19,375 --> 00:03:21,583
Spelunking's not
always the answer.

30
00:03:21,666 --> 00:03:22,833
Chill out bro;

31
00:03:22,916 --> 00:03:24,583
maybe I was bein' metaphorical,
you don't know.

32
00:03:24,666 --> 00:03:26,791
Either way, this
place is overdue

33
00:03:26,875 --> 00:03:28,333
for a little bedrock shakin'--

34
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:30,708
somethin' to really
mine out the potential.

35
00:03:30,791 --> 00:03:32,083
Yeah, dude.

36
00:03:32,166 --> 00:03:34,166
You're still totally
talking about digging a hole.

37
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:36,291
Bah--bah--bah--bah;
whatevs dude.

38
00:03:36,375 --> 00:03:38,791
'sides, by "diem,"
I meant tomorrow.

39
00:03:39,708 --> 00:03:43,500
The twelfth anniversary of The
Holy Angel Academy's founding.

40
00:03:43,583 --> 00:03:45,583
Twelve years ago tomorrow
will mark the day ground

41
00:03:45,666 --> 00:03:48,875
was first broken on this
hallowed establishment--

42
00:03:48,958 --> 00:03:51,000
a day symbolizing
humanity's readiness

43
00:03:51,083 --> 00:03:53,750
to meet the threat
facing our planet.

44
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:55,833
Across those twelve years...

45
00:03:55,916 --> 00:03:57,708
Does she ever stop?

46
00:03:57,791 --> 00:04:00,166
whom I have every expectation
this class will honor

47
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:02,666
by living up to their
example and, in turn,

48
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:05,291
raising the bar ever
higher for those

49
00:04:05,375 --> 00:04:07,000
who will follow
in your footsteps.

50
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:10,791
"Whaddya say we
ditch the daily grind

51
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:14,875
in honor of tomorrow's true
meaning: freedom, fun and funk!"

52
00:04:14,958 --> 00:04:16,833
"Boy's dorm after Vespers,

53
00:04:16,916 --> 00:04:21,291
bring an umbrella for the
brainstorming." Seriously?

54
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:24,083
He may not sound
all that sincere.

55
00:04:24,166 --> 00:04:25,166
What's goin' on?

56
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:28,166
Hey, you oughta
be in on this, too.

57
00:04:29,833 --> 00:04:32,416
Dude, what's wrong with you,
it's not a slumber party!

58
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:33,916
What are you babbling about?

59
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,208
Nothing!

60
00:04:46,208 --> 00:04:48,250
Yo, sheepdog!
Wanna give me a hand?

61
00:04:50,041 --> 00:04:51,875
Hold up, what're
you about to do?

62
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:53,125
'scuse me?

63
00:04:53,208 --> 00:04:54,583
You're not callin' it a night?!

64
00:04:54,666 --> 00:04:56,041
Sleep when you're
dead, lazy eye,

65
00:04:56,125 --> 00:04:58,583
we've got ourselves some
womenfolk on the way!

66
00:04:59,375 --> 00:05:00,625
You heard correct.

67
00:05:00,708 --> 00:05:02,916
My man, this humble
abode is gonna play host

68
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,583
to what the ancients
called a slumber party!

69
00:05:05,666 --> 00:05:07,666
Hang on, I thought you
said it wasn't that.

70
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:09,666
Shut up, Red. Not helping here.

71
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:11,541
Feel free to stop me
if I'm wide o' the mark,

72
00:05:11,625 --> 00:05:13,708
but you're no Don Juan, amirite?

73
00:05:13,791 --> 00:05:15,208
Best get your head
around the fairer sex

74
00:05:15,291 --> 00:05:17,541
before you have to merge
with one in the field.

75
00:05:17,625 --> 00:05:19,166
Merge with...?

76
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:20,750
Give the man a prize!

77
00:05:20,833 --> 00:05:24,208
Yes. Merge with.
As in, the Ladies.

78
00:05:24,291 --> 00:05:27,208
Dude, there's nothing
sweeter in the world.

79
00:05:29,125 --> 00:05:30,791
Can't be as good as all that.

80
00:05:30,875 --> 00:05:33,416
Words don't even begin
to describe it, my friend.

81
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:37,500
Oh-ho. Dude, it is all
that n' then some, believe me.

82
00:05:37,583 --> 00:05:40,625
I love how you're the
expert all of a sudden.

83
00:05:41,458 --> 00:05:43,416
So, go on.

84
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:55,000
How long has this
tunnel been here?

85
00:06:01,041 --> 00:06:02,208
You gonna be okay?

86
00:06:02,291 --> 00:06:05,750
Of course. Duh.
It's not like I'm terrified.

87
00:06:09,583 --> 00:06:12,333
I've really got to stop
sneaking up on you, huh?

88
00:06:12,791 --> 00:06:14,666
Yunoha?

89
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:17,708
Would it be all right if
I tag along with you guys?

90
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,500
Why the stormy look?

91
00:06:25,583 --> 00:06:27,291
None of your business.

92
00:06:27,375 --> 00:06:30,125
Then you might want to
try being less obvious.

93
00:06:30,208 --> 00:06:33,416
I take it the new guy is
still under your skin?

94
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,666
I'll say this much for the boy--

95
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:40,083
he's well on his way to
making brooding an art form.

96
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:43,041
Heh, much like
somebody else we know.

97
00:06:45,416 --> 00:06:48,750
I don't brood, I boil over!

98
00:06:50,541 --> 00:06:51,708
Ugh, eureka...

99
00:06:51,791 --> 00:06:54,125
Wait, what the hell's this?!

100
00:06:57,416 --> 00:06:58,750
Bring on the funk!

101
00:06:58,833 --> 00:07:01,541
Welcome to the Forbidden Zone,
mademoiselles!

102
00:07:01,625 --> 00:07:03,625
Come! Allons--y!

103
00:07:03,708 --> 00:07:05,333
Make yourselves at ho-- 

104
00:07:08,416 --> 00:07:11,041
Dude! Who invited
these buttwads?

105
00:07:11,125 --> 00:07:13,291
They sort of, found us
out in the courtyard.

106
00:07:13,375 --> 00:07:14,791
Huh?

107
00:07:15,583 --> 00:07:18,625
Consider your soiree
officially crashed.

108
00:07:18,708 --> 00:07:20,125
This is all perfectly innocent.

109
00:07:20,208 --> 00:07:22,041
We just wanna put our
heads together to come up

110
00:07:22,125 --> 00:07:24,083
with something for the
school's big anniversary

111
00:07:24,166 --> 00:07:26,166
that's not your run-of-the-mill
thing, you know?

112
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:28,041
That why he's in his jammies?

113
00:07:28,125 --> 00:07:29,333
Hold on there, tiger!

114
00:07:29,416 --> 00:07:30,750
I think you're
reading into things.

115
00:07:30,833 --> 00:07:32,333
Not like I'm in
my skivvies, right?

116
00:07:32,416 --> 00:07:35,166
Some of us just think more
clearly when we're comfy.

117
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:36,166
Don't go in there!

118
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:37,958
Nobody cleared you
to nose around!

119
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:39,875
I'm field testing Mix's theory.

120
00:07:39,958 --> 00:07:42,708
See, she insists you
boys--all boys, really--

121
00:07:42,791 --> 00:07:44,833
build nests out of smut.

122
00:07:46,458 --> 00:07:48,833
But, I'm not really an
expert on such things.

123
00:07:48,916 --> 00:07:51,750
This is uncharted ground for me.

124
00:07:51,833 --> 00:07:53,583
I only read that
for the articles!

125
00:07:57,541 --> 00:07:59,166
Hey, there.

126
00:08:00,416 --> 00:08:02,583
Ah-ha! Filthy, filthy jackpot!

127
00:08:02,666 --> 00:08:03,958
No don't--!

128
00:08:05,625 --> 00:08:07,291
That's Silvie.

129
00:08:07,375 --> 00:08:09,250
Like, the actress, or...?

130
00:08:09,333 --> 00:08:12,875
She was the lead in
Skies of Aquaria, I think.

131
00:08:12,958 --> 00:08:15,291
I'm kind of an admirer.

132
00:08:15,375 --> 00:08:16,916
's a pretty candid
shot for somethin'

133
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,333
you'd find in a magazine.

134
00:08:18,416 --> 00:08:21,291
What a coincidence,
Jin's a bit of fanboy, too.

135
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:24,083
Really? That's adorable.

136
00:08:24,166 --> 00:08:26,625
Go on. Let them see
that hologram thingie.

137
00:08:26,708 --> 00:08:30,458
You know, the one that
plays her big hit song.

138
00:08:31,625 --> 00:08:33,500
Well, don't hold out on us, man.

139
00:08:43,333 --> 00:08:44,500
Oh, wow!

140
00:08:44,583 --> 00:08:47,833
Dude, where'd you find this?

141
00:08:47,916 --> 00:08:49,708
That's what we're gonna do!

142
00:08:49,791 --> 00:08:51,083
We're listening.

143
00:08:51,166 --> 00:08:52,541
What better way to ring
in the school's anniversary

144
00:08:52,625 --> 00:08:55,083
than with a Skies
of Aquaria screening?

145
00:08:55,166 --> 00:08:58,500
That sounds like a
great idea! Right?

146
00:09:06,166 --> 00:09:08,041
Come one, come all!

147
00:09:08,125 --> 00:09:09,583
Witness the Berlin yield

148
00:09:09,666 --> 00:09:12,583
to the greatest love story
ever brought to celluloid!

149
00:09:12,666 --> 00:09:13,875
Join us on the commons

150
00:09:13,958 --> 00:09:16,333
for a midnight showing
of Skies of Aquaria,

151
00:09:16,416 --> 00:09:20,500
featuring a special musical
performance by Shrade!

152
00:09:21,083 --> 00:09:23,250
You're using the
Berlin as a screen?

153
00:09:23,333 --> 00:09:25,541
I hope you cleared this
through the proper channels.

154
00:09:25,625 --> 00:09:27,125
You think I'd plan
something this epic

155
00:09:27,208 --> 00:09:29,333
without letting
Big Brother in on it?

156
00:09:29,416 --> 00:09:31,125
You're gonna be there,
aren't cha?

157
00:09:31,541 --> 00:09:33,416
You don't gotta sit on
the lawn with the peons.

158
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:35,500
I've arranged it so you can ogle

159
00:09:35,583 --> 00:09:37,166
from the comfort
of your balcony.

160
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:38,708
Assuming you haven't
asked some lucky guy

161
00:09:38,791 --> 00:09:41,416
to join you-- in which
case, I'm up for bids.

162
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:43,833
I'd rather have surgery!

163
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:45,833
I don't like this. Not one bit.

164
00:09:45,916 --> 00:09:47,458
Suppose there's
an Abductor raid.

165
00:09:47,541 --> 00:09:48,958
We'll be caught
with our pants down!

166
00:09:49,041 --> 00:09:51,833
All work and no play,
Mister Dantes.

167
00:09:51,916 --> 00:09:55,750
They used to call
it the Dream Factory.

168
00:09:55,833 --> 00:09:57,833
Appropriate, wouldn't you agree?

169
00:09:57,916 --> 00:10:01,250
Cinema dell'arte.
The dream within a dream.

170
00:10:02,375 --> 00:10:04,708
Damn it! Talk to me!

171
00:10:04,791 --> 00:10:07,500
This is an emergency!
Somebody respond!

172
00:10:07,875 --> 00:10:10,125
What's going on up there?
Son of a bitch.

173
00:10:10,208 --> 00:10:13,750
I need to push a message
through to high command.

174
00:10:13,833 --> 00:10:15,208
I've honed in on a Rare Igura

175
00:10:15,291 --> 00:10:17,166
who fits the
criteria like a glove.

176
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:18,791
I'm going to hijack
one of their Vectors

177
00:10:18,875 --> 00:10:20,500
and bring her back with me.

178
00:10:20,583 --> 00:10:22,166
Be ready to open the gate.

179
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:23,833
What are you doing?

180
00:10:28,083 --> 00:10:31,458
How, uh, how much of
that did you hear?

181
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:33,750
What did you hear?!

182
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:37,375
Nothing, I- I just thought...

183
00:10:37,458 --> 00:10:39,291
A little help please, Yunoha.

184
00:10:39,375 --> 00:10:41,291
Could use a second
pair of hands.

185
00:10:45,083 --> 00:10:46,666
No, wait!

186
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:00,416
Stay away!

187
00:11:09,416 --> 00:11:11,208
What have I done?

188
00:11:13,041 --> 00:11:16,000
Oh my gosh, we absolutely
have to get it with pineapple!

189
00:11:16,083 --> 00:11:19,416
Ew! Gross!
What are you, pregnant?

190
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,416
Hey, Zessica!

191
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,250
What toppings do you
want on your pizza?

192
00:11:23,333 --> 00:11:24,500
We're getting delivery

193
00:11:24,583 --> 00:11:25,958
from this place that has
just about everything.

194
00:11:26,041 --> 00:11:30,041
Whatever's fine.
Sorry, I'm kinda busy.

195
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,791
It's pretty cool, them
showing our movie.

196
00:11:34,875 --> 00:11:37,458
I wouldn't be here if
I hadn't been curious about it.

197
00:11:37,541 --> 00:11:39,083
Lucky I happened to
walk into your theatre

198
00:11:39,166 --> 00:11:41,750
that afternoon, don'tcha think?

199
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:43,333
Yeah.

200
00:11:43,416 --> 00:11:44,708
I wouldn't have--

201
00:11:44,791 --> 00:11:47,416
I mean we wouldn't even
be having this conversation.

202
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:51,666
Sorry.

203
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:53,166
Where's this coming from?

204
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:55,708
I dunno. Guess I feel
like it's my fault

205
00:11:55,791 --> 00:11:57,500
you've been put on
the front lines.

206
00:11:57,583 --> 00:11:59,166
You didn't force me here!

207
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:03,833
Really, it was my choice--
the whole thing.

208
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:07,750
It's like Alicia says
in the beginning...

209
00:12:09,041 --> 00:12:10,458
"Deep down,
we all have the wings

210
00:12:10,541 --> 00:12:14,958
to outsoar our destiny,
to fly above it all."

211
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:27,666
Yeah, well. She knew a
thing or two about that.

212
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:35,875
When I-- When I was still
a kid, mom just outsoared me.

213
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:41,333
As soon as they wrapped
that movie, she was gone.

214
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:45,333
That's why you're
so obsessed with it.

215
00:12:46,125 --> 00:12:49,875
She felt like whatever
her destiny was,

216
00:12:49,958 --> 00:12:54,666
she had to escape it,
leaving me to fend for myself.

217
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:59,083
And I watched her go,
just stood there.

218
00:13:00,083 --> 00:13:04,833
I mean, sure, I yelled, but
she-- I got what I deserved.

219
00:13:04,916 --> 00:13:07,875
Don't talk like that!

220
00:13:09,083 --> 00:13:12,666
I used to feel like you,
always in my brother's shadow.

221
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:16,458
Everything I ever
did was worthless.

222
00:13:16,541 --> 00:13:19,000
As far back as anyone in
my family could remember,

223
00:13:19,083 --> 00:13:24,375
we all had powers, but
I wasn't lucky enough, I guess.

224
00:13:24,458 --> 00:13:26,041
I was the odd one out.

225
00:13:27,625 --> 00:13:28,625
When Cayenne got accepted

226
00:13:28,708 --> 00:13:31,416
into Neo-DEAVA, that was it.

227
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:38,458
So what? I'm not
like him; who cares?

228
00:13:38,541 --> 00:13:40,750
I still have a right.

229
00:13:40,833 --> 00:13:42,916
I still deserve to be happy.

230
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,875
So do you!
Not everyone's gonna fly away.

231
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:49,166
I won't.

232
00:13:50,958 --> 00:13:52,166
Uh, I mean, come on!

233
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:53,333
You saved my life

234
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:55,375
before we even knew
each other's names.

235
00:13:55,458 --> 00:13:57,416
You were, I-- 

236
00:13:59,541 --> 00:14:01,166
Thank you for that.

237
00:14:02,458 --> 00:14:06,875
So, you, uh,
wanna catch a movie?

238
00:14:07,625 --> 00:14:11,083
Bet I can find us a spot
where nobody'll bother us.

239
00:14:11,166 --> 00:14:14,625
Where-- Where'd
you have in mind?

240
00:14:16,041 --> 00:14:20,708
Well, a bird's-eye seems
like a good way to find seats.

241
00:14:30,375 --> 00:14:32,791
Well, how's a girl s'posed
to refuse an offer like that?

242
00:14:32,875 --> 00:14:35,750
Tell you what, for now, let's
keep our feet on the ground.

243
00:14:38,333 --> 00:14:39,458
No! Don't grab there!

244
00:14:39,541 --> 00:14:40,625
That's not gonna help!

245
00:14:40,708 --> 00:14:42,708
Oh, calm down.
You act like we're naked.

246
00:14:42,791 --> 00:14:44,583
Mikono, I'm serious!

247
00:15:02,458 --> 00:15:06,041
'kay, look, you're
gonna tell her I'm sorry.

248
00:15:06,875 --> 00:15:09,000
I've got to take
her back with me.

249
00:15:09,083 --> 00:15:11,750
Fat chance of that
if she thinks I'm a creep.

250
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,333
A fascinating turn of
events, don't you agree?

251
00:15:36,416 --> 00:15:40,916
Fascinating? You're a monster.

252
00:15:41,291 --> 00:15:45,000
Perhaps, insofar as
your puerile categories

253
00:15:45,083 --> 00:15:47,458
of thought approach me.

254
00:15:47,541 --> 00:15:48,875
Stop this.

255
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:50,583
Turn your mind.

256
00:15:50,666 --> 00:15:54,708
Focus on the seedling's
predicament.

257
00:15:54,791 --> 00:15:56,458
Is not his inaugural foray

258
00:15:56,541 --> 00:15:59,083
into the pitfalls of
love a thing divine?

259
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:01,625
Speak plainly, damn you!

260
00:16:01,708 --> 00:16:05,958
None may speak so plain
as the unalloyed heart.

261
00:16:12,541 --> 00:16:16,708
Look, about earlier, I'm a dick.

262
00:16:16,791 --> 00:16:18,041
No you're not.

263
00:16:18,125 --> 00:16:21,708
You might've overreacted,
but we all do sometimes.

264
00:16:21,791 --> 00:16:25,041
Besides, everybody has
a right to their secrets.

265
00:16:25,125 --> 00:16:27,083
It's none of my business
what you were doing.

266
00:16:27,166 --> 00:16:29,083
Well, yeah, but I was still--

267
00:16:29,166 --> 00:16:31,250
We can share the blame,

268
00:16:31,333 --> 00:16:33,333
but you've got to
take my word for it

269
00:16:33,416 --> 00:16:34,875
when I say
I didn't hear anything.

270
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:39,416
So you believe me?

271
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:41,625
Uh, yeah, o'course!

272
00:16:43,791 --> 00:16:46,125
It was sweet of you
to patch up Tama's arm.

273
00:16:46,208 --> 00:16:47,291
Tama?

274
00:16:47,375 --> 00:16:49,458
That's her name, yeah.

275
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:51,041
Oh. Sure.

276
00:16:52,208 --> 00:16:53,875
Are we okay?

277
00:16:53,958 --> 00:16:55,750
Totally.

278
00:16:55,833 --> 00:16:58,875
I was thinking, maybe
tonight you and I could,

279
00:16:58,958 --> 00:17:00,500
I dunno, watch
the movie together?

280
00:17:00,583 --> 00:17:02,583
Only if you're
interested, though.

281
00:17:03,875 --> 00:17:05,416
I've never seen it before,

282
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:07,833
but I'm definitely interested.

283
00:17:07,916 --> 00:17:11,250
And I guess it'd be
sorta lame to see alone.

284
00:17:11,333 --> 00:17:14,416
Like a date?

285
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:18,625
I'll meet you back here
later! You're the best.

286
00:17:18,708 --> 00:17:21,125
Wait! Before--

287
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:29,250
I'm glad you're
coming out of your shell.

288
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:43,166
Oh, man, is this what
Andy was talking about?

289
00:18:09,541 --> 00:18:11,625
Didn't I leave it right here?

290
00:18:13,416 --> 00:18:15,541
Aw, screw the damn thing.

291
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:31,041
Aren't you pretty.

292
00:18:38,291 --> 00:18:41,750
Hello, Jin? You there?

293
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,416
Message received, Jin.

294
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:55,041
Fair warning.
Kagura is en route to Vega.

295
00:18:55,125 --> 00:18:58,041
Be ready for the
gate to bust wide open.

296
00:18:58,125 --> 00:18:59,625
It's vital you seize the Vector

297
00:18:59,708 --> 00:19:02,250
and get your Rare Igura here
before the crazy son of a bitch

298
00:19:02,333 --> 00:19:04,458
decimates
everything in his path.

299
00:19:11,625 --> 00:19:13,000
Not late am I?

300
00:19:15,916 --> 00:19:17,500
What's wrong?

301
00:19:24,458 --> 00:19:26,291
Not a thing.

302
00:19:47,666 --> 00:19:48,958
Cheers!

303
00:20:06,333 --> 00:20:08,791
Ladies and gentlemen,
for your viewing pleasure--

304
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:12,666
the rare cinematic jewel,
Skies of Aquaria!

305
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:16,041
Kick back, put up
your feet, and enjoy!

306
00:20:24,625 --> 00:20:28,500
This is a story of
meetings and partings,

307
00:20:28,583 --> 00:20:30,958
of tragedies and miracles.

308
00:20:33,291 --> 00:20:36,291
A story of softly
whispered promises,

309
00:20:36,375 --> 00:20:40,583
of vows made in
ages past. Of love.

310
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:54,375
We all have the wings
to outsoar our destiny

311
00:20:54,458 --> 00:20:57,333
to fly above it all.

312
00:21:44,625 --> 00:21:48,041
Abductor alert! Abductor alert!
This is not a drill!

313
00:21:48,708 --> 00:21:49,666
Really?!

314
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:51,416
Somebody tell me
this is a bad dream.

315
00:21:58,333 --> 00:21:59,916
Kagura!

316
00:22:04,958 --> 00:22:06,791
It's him! Bastard's back!

317
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:15,500
Are you okay?

318
00:22:25,166 --> 00:22:27,166
You have something
that belongs to me!

319
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:29,333
Give her back!

320
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:40,833
Listen to me, Yunoha.

321
00:22:40,916 --> 00:22:43,625
Don't ask questions.
Do as I say.

322
00:24:23,208 --> 00:24:26,000
The boy feels
resolutely a cappella.

323
00:24:26,083 --> 00:24:29,583
The girl would have
him feel obbligato,

324
00:24:29,666 --> 00:24:33,375
such is the tension inherent
in the grandest of duets.

325
00:24:33,458 --> 00:24:36,458
Next time on Aquarion Evol:
"Fallen Giant."
