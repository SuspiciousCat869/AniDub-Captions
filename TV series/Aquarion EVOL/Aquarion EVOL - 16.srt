00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,541
[DONAR] Amata's team will
form Aquarion Evol!

162
00:09:20,625 --> 00:09:22,166
Roger that!

163
00:09:26,291 --> 00:09:28,000
Initiate Training Merge!

164
00:09:28,083 --> 00:09:31,083
Go... Aquarion!

165
00:09:39,375 --> 00:09:41,416
[CAYENNE]
Aquarion... Gepard!

166
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:47,166
[AMATA]
Aquarion... Evol!

167
00:09:52,833 --> 00:09:55,125
[DONAR] No restrictions on
Element power for either team!

168
00:09:55,208 --> 00:09:57,333
Treat your opponent
like the real McCoy...

169
00:09:57,416 --> 00:09:59,375
Fight like your
life depends on it!

170
00:10:00,125 --> 00:10:01,166
[CAYENNE]
All right then...

171
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:02,041
If you really think
you're man enough

172
00:10:02,125 --> 00:10:04,750
to protect my little sister...

173
00:10:04,833 --> 00:10:06,875
Show me what you've got punk!

174
00:10:14,791 --> 00:10:15,583
Amata!

175
00:10:15,666 --> 00:10:17,625
We'd better move or we're toast!

176
00:10:17,708 --> 00:10:19,791
Let's close in and use
the buildings as cover!

177
00:10:21,125 --> 00:10:23,708
It's crumblin' time!

178
00:10:34,041 --> 00:10:34,875
Holy--!

179
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:36,708
Okay, so cover's
not an option...

180
00:10:36,791 --> 00:10:39,041
Like the little
power upgrade I got

181
00:10:39,125 --> 00:10:40,708
after the whole
death-and-resurrection bit...?

182
00:10:40,791 --> 00:10:44,125
Well it's my first time to
use it in action, so enjoy!

183
00:10:47,041 --> 00:10:48,208
The Curse of Malloy...

184
00:10:48,291 --> 00:10:50,750
It compromises the
stability of any material;

185
00:10:50,833 --> 00:10:52,333
no matter how strong.

186
00:10:52,416 --> 00:10:53,500
With the slightest touch,

187
00:10:53,583 --> 00:10:55,875
he can topple a skyscraper.

188
00:10:59,291 --> 00:11:00,625
Sorry, gang.

189
00:11:00,708 --> 00:11:03,750
You gotta do better than
hide if you wanna cinch this!

190
00:11:08,166 --> 00:11:10,750
Come on, Mikono,
I know you can do it!

191
00:11:17,666 --> 00:11:19,416
Amata! We have to keep moving,

192
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:20,750
they're closing in on us fast!

193
00:11:20,833 --> 00:11:22,083
You're wrong, that's exactly

194
00:11:22,166 --> 00:11:23,708
what they want us to do!

195
00:11:23,791 --> 00:11:26,250
Just a little further!

196
00:11:26,333 --> 00:11:28,916
Amata, stop! We can't
win if we keep running!

197
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,375
[MIKONO]
He knows that...!

198
00:11:30,458 --> 00:11:31,916
But it's not like we have
much choice at the moment...

199
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,291
[AMATA]
Guys, I'm trying to concentrate!

200
00:11:38,958 --> 00:11:41,875
Gepard's strength is engaging
in long range combat...

201
00:11:41,958 --> 00:11:44,708
As long as I'm running,
they do have the advantage.

202
00:11:45,833 --> 00:11:46,458
Amata!

203
00:11:46,541 --> 00:11:47,541
Behind you!

204
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:49,583
[EVOL CREW]
Ahh!!

205
00:11:52,708 --> 00:11:54,250
Not gonna work, my friend!

206
00:11:54,333 --> 00:11:56,041
[MALLOY] Hole-diggin' is
kindergarten crap compared

207
00:11:56,125 --> 00:11:59,541
to what my powers to curse
and crumble are capable of!

208
00:11:59,625 --> 00:12:00,541
Damn it, Malloy...!

209
00:12:00,625 --> 00:12:01,875
You talk smack about holes

210
00:12:01,958 --> 00:12:04,333
one more time and
you'll regret it!

211
00:12:05,166 --> 00:12:07,541
Infinity punch!

212
00:12:08,583 --> 00:12:09,958
Why're we losing balance?!

213
00:12:10,291 --> 00:12:13,375
[ZESSICA] Look! Evol's feet...!
They're rusting!

214
00:12:15,625 --> 00:12:18,875
I got an Element Power
upgrade too: corrosion.

215
00:12:21,458 --> 00:12:22,375
No matter how solid,

216
00:12:22,458 --> 00:12:24,958
I can make any
object simply rot!

217
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:30,375
This is over!

218
00:12:32,375 --> 00:12:34,625
[AMATA]
Infinity punch!

219
00:12:40,583 --> 00:12:42,291
Keep on running away like that,

220
00:12:42,375 --> 00:12:44,541
Amata-- you're just
making it easy on us!

221
00:12:45,666 --> 00:12:46,916
[AMATA]
The rusting may have stopped,

222
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,416
but still-We can't get
in close like that again.

223
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,416
It's time to throw in the towel!

224
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:52,916
This battle was over before you

225
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,583
even beamed aboard
your Vector, my friend.

226
00:12:55,666 --> 00:12:58,166
It's a little thing
we call... Fate.

227
00:12:58,250 --> 00:12:59,875
Fate?

228
00:12:59,958 --> 00:13:01,708
[CAYENNE]
Accept your defeat!

229
00:13:09,125 --> 00:13:10,083
Damn it!

230
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:12,833
[AMATA]
What's happening?

231
00:13:12,916 --> 00:13:14,666
Is he predicting my moves?

232
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:16,750
[CAYENNE]
What'll it be, Amata...?

233
00:13:16,833 --> 00:13:17,958
If this weren't a simulation,

234
00:13:18,041 --> 00:13:20,791
I would've cut your
Evol in half by now.

235
00:13:21,583 --> 00:13:23,166
[CREA]
His prophecy of despair...

236
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:25,083
Cayenne can see
into the future...

237
00:13:25,166 --> 00:13:26,625
Before you deign to make a move,

238
00:13:26,708 --> 00:13:29,458
he's already seen the
ace tucked up your sleeve.

239
00:13:29,541 --> 00:13:31,666
[SUOMI] Fudo's burial
exercise truly raised

240
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:33,875
their aura levels
to new heights.

241
00:13:33,958 --> 00:13:36,375
This is an
unstoppable combination...

242
00:13:36,458 --> 00:13:39,083
Cayenne's prophecy
with Gepard's artillery.

243
00:13:39,166 --> 00:13:40,458
He can direct his fire right

244
00:13:40,541 --> 00:13:42,208
where the enemy's about to move!

245
00:13:42,291 --> 00:13:44,166
Buncha crap!

246
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:45,750
[YUNOHA]
Jin...

247
00:13:45,833 --> 00:13:47,916
please protect Mikono
and the others.

248
00:13:49,166 --> 00:13:50,083
[CAYENNE]
Well?

249
00:13:50,166 --> 00:13:51,625
What's your next
move gonna be...?

250
00:13:51,708 --> 00:13:55,500
Diversion...? Retreat...?
A forward attack...?

251
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:57,250
Whatever it is, I'll be ready.

252
00:13:57,916 --> 00:14:00,625
[CAYENNE] I can see the defeat
you're destined to suffer.

253
00:14:02,458 --> 00:14:03,916
I won't give up...

254
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,458
I won't just surrender
to destiny...!

255
00:14:06,541 --> 00:14:08,833
We all choose our
own fate in this life!

256
00:14:09,333 --> 00:14:10,166
Amata.

257
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:11,083
Oh, wow.

258
00:14:11,166 --> 00:14:12,958
I don't care if it was predicted

259
00:14:13,041 --> 00:14:14,208
twelve thousand years ago,

260
00:14:14,291 --> 00:14:15,666
I'm gonna fight it
with everything I have...

261
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:17,875
Screw fate... I won't stop!

262
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:20,750
I'll battle the stars
to my dying breath!

263
00:14:22,666 --> 00:14:24,083
[ZESSICA]
Amata, you're right.

264
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,125
[AMATA]
Zessica?

265
00:14:26,208 --> 00:14:28,083
I told you about my vision...

266
00:14:28,166 --> 00:14:30,583
The one where I saw
your future in the mirror...

267
00:14:30,666 --> 00:14:33,500
I thought it was
your destiny... at first...

268
00:14:33,583 --> 00:14:35,958
But there's something
more important than fate.

269
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:37,666
Our hearts are what matter...

270
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:39,375
What we feel and desire...

271
00:14:39,458 --> 00:14:41,375
The things we
live our lives for...!

272
00:14:41,458 --> 00:14:43,791
Not destiny,
fate or anything else...

273
00:14:43,875 --> 00:14:46,625
Only the truth we
feel in our souls.

274
00:14:46,708 --> 00:14:47,666
Skip the drama

275
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:49,333
and come clean
about how you feel!

276
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:54,333
I think I can say it...
I can speak the truth.

277
00:14:54,416 --> 00:14:57,958
[MIKONO] Zessica, what
are you talking about?

278
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:01,708
Listen to me... Please.

279
00:15:01,791 --> 00:15:05,041
Okay.

280
00:15:05,125 --> 00:15:06,333
The thing is...

281
00:15:06,416 --> 00:15:08,541
I mean what I'm trying to say-

282
00:15:10,541 --> 00:15:12,708
Yeah, I'd say they're
done fighting for the day.

283
00:15:12,791 --> 00:15:16,416
Come on, then.
Let's put an end to this thing!

284
00:15:20,583 --> 00:15:22,250
Fire!

285
00:15:29,625 --> 00:15:31,833
Amata... Amata, I looo--

286
00:15:31,916 --> 00:15:35,833
Oh... I love you!

287
00:15:39,083 --> 00:15:41,250
Wow, that was a close call...

288
00:15:41,333 --> 00:15:43,958
I'm sorry Zessica, you
were saying something...?

289
00:15:44,708 --> 00:15:48,000
I couldn't hear...
a word over the explosions.

290
00:15:49,708 --> 00:15:52,458
[AMATA] You said it was
important... Go on.

291
00:15:52,541 --> 00:15:54,458
[MIKONO]
Yeah, we can hear you now.

292
00:16:01,875 --> 00:16:03,500
I always have...

293
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:08,375
And I always will love... you.

294
00:16:08,458 --> 00:16:10,000
Huh?

295
00:16:10,083 --> 00:16:12,625
I've wanted to
tell you for so long!

296
00:16:12,708 --> 00:16:14,708
I love you!

297
00:16:18,041 --> 00:16:20,291
Love?

298
00:16:20,375 --> 00:16:21,625
Love?!

299
00:16:21,708 --> 00:16:22,958
Oh my...

300
00:16:23,041 --> 00:16:24,333
Did she...

301
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:25,250
Just say...

302
00:16:25,333 --> 00:16:26,166
What I...

303
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:26,916
Think she...

304
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,625
Just said...?

305
00:16:33,375 --> 00:16:37,916
Love!

306
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:41,541
I said it!

307
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:43,833
 Uh... Zessica?

308
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:49,500
The hell--?!

309
00:16:49,583 --> 00:16:50,625
The Evol, it's...!

310
00:16:50,708 --> 00:16:52,083
It's glowing pink!

311
00:17:00,625 --> 00:17:02,166
Commander,
Evol's emotional gauge

312
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:04,583
is reaching
unprecedented heights!

313
00:17:04,666 --> 00:17:05,708
It can't be!

314
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:07,875
Zessica's feelings
are so powerful!

315
00:17:07,958 --> 00:17:09,916
So the damn thing
not only goes berserk

316
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,333
over mutual affection,

317
00:17:11,416 --> 00:17:14,875
it flies off the handle over the
unrequited kind, too?!

318
00:17:15,541 --> 00:17:16,333
I uh...

319
00:17:16,416 --> 00:17:18,000
don't really know what to say...

320
00:17:18,083 --> 00:17:19,791
I'm flattered but I just don't--

321
00:17:19,875 --> 00:17:21,125
Amata, stop!

322
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:31,583
Wait, what the hell...
Evol's moving on its own!

323
00:17:47,416 --> 00:17:48,833
The Infinity Punch!

324
00:17:48,916 --> 00:17:49,958
Wow!

325
00:17:50,041 --> 00:17:51,666
Zen, what's happening?

326
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:53,750
It's finally begun.

327
00:17:56,708 --> 00:17:58,166
[FUDO]
When they take the final step

328
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:01,333
by venturing into the terra
incognita of forbidden love...

329
00:18:01,416 --> 00:18:04,708
The power Aquarion unleashes
crosses time and space...

330
00:18:04,791 --> 00:18:08,708
Life and death.
Heart and soul... Love.

331
00:18:14,291 --> 00:18:15,666
What the...?

332
00:18:16,166 --> 00:18:17,500
[AMATA]
This is incredible...

333
00:18:17,583 --> 00:18:20,375
images are coming
through the punch!

334
00:18:20,458 --> 00:18:22,625
[MIKONO]
I don't recognize this place...

335
00:18:22,708 --> 00:18:24,208
[ZESSICA]
Where are we?

336
00:18:25,625 --> 00:18:26,541
[MIKONO]
Who's that?

337
00:18:26,625 --> 00:18:28,500
[ZESSICA]
He's like a wild animal!

338
00:18:40,166 --> 00:18:41,958
Apollon and Silvie?

339
00:18:44,375 --> 00:18:45,833
[AMATA]
Aquarion!

340
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:48,416
[MIKONO] Yeah... But
it looks a little old timey...

341
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:49,625
Doesn't it?

342
00:18:50,541 --> 00:18:52,916
[GEN]
Aquarion...!

343
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,833
Rise up now, and regroup!

344
00:18:54,916 --> 00:18:56,166
High Commander Fudo?

345
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:59,041
I think so.
It sure looks like him!

346
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,166
[MIKAGE] Finally, it's
happening at last...!

347
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:09,291
This is the true
light of Solar Wing

348
00:19:09,375 --> 00:19:11,583
as it should have
been centuries ago...!

349
00:19:11,666 --> 00:19:12,750
They don't realize it,

350
00:19:12,833 --> 00:19:15,166
but their struggle
will restore our power!

351
00:19:16,541 --> 00:19:17,833
That man looks familiar.

352
00:19:17,916 --> 00:19:18,916
You're right,

353
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,333
like I've seen him
somewhere before.

354
00:19:20,416 --> 00:19:21,500
But where...?

355
00:19:21,583 --> 00:19:23,208
For the life of me I don't know.

356
00:19:26,416 --> 00:19:27,583
An Aquarion with wings?

357
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:28,666
Amazing.

358
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:30,958
Wait... that's...
Could it be? Yeah!

359
00:19:31,041 --> 00:19:33,166
It's the Legendary Aquarion!

360
00:19:33,708 --> 00:19:35,500
[SILVIA]
They've become Solar Wing!

361
00:19:37,458 --> 00:19:38,416
Apollo!

362
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:40,416
Thank you, Silvia...
For everything.

363
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:41,416
Apollo?

364
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:42,458
Silvia?

365
00:19:42,541 --> 00:19:44,500
Yeah right, Silvi-a?

366
00:19:44,583 --> 00:19:46,625
I'll always remember this scent.

367
00:19:48,083 --> 00:19:49,708
I'll never forget you.

368
00:19:49,791 --> 00:19:51,333
Apo--

369
00:19:56,041 --> 00:19:57,291
[APOLLO]
I have to go...

370
00:19:57,375 --> 00:20:00,458
But I'll find you again...
I promise.

371
00:20:03,041 --> 00:20:04,500
Apollo!

372
00:20:17,583 --> 00:20:18,791
[ZESSICA]
Is this it?

373
00:20:18,875 --> 00:20:20,958
[MIKONO]
Could it be?

374
00:20:21,041 --> 00:20:23,958
[AMATA] The true story of
twelve thousand years ago!

375
00:20:28,291 --> 00:20:29,208
Crap-- hang on!

376
00:20:45,625 --> 00:20:47,166
Someone give me
a status report...!

377
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:48,750
What happened out there?!

378
00:20:48,833 --> 00:20:50,208
The signal's clearing up...!

379
00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:51,541
We're getting video!

380
00:20:55,708 --> 00:20:57,208
No way!

381
00:20:57,791 --> 00:20:59,458
[ANDY]
The island's blown to bits.

382
00:20:59,541 --> 00:21:01,333
There's almost nothing left.

383
00:21:01,416 --> 00:21:03,583
[CIERRO] We have vitals
on both of them, sir!

384
00:21:03,666 --> 00:21:06,333
Gepard... Evol...
Both are intact!

385
00:21:08,875 --> 00:21:12,041
One possesses a heart
that seeks only truth...

386
00:21:12,125 --> 00:21:15,500
The other a heart that
searches out only true love...

387
00:21:15,583 --> 00:21:17,583
Now the two have
become as one...

388
00:21:17,666 --> 00:21:18,708
Forbidden power...

389
00:21:18,791 --> 00:21:20,458
lost since the
days of antiquity,

390
00:21:20,541 --> 00:21:22,291
has been reawakened.

391
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:25,083
[SAZANKA]
Help...?!

392
00:21:25,166 --> 00:21:27,083
Somebody get us out of here!

393
00:21:27,166 --> 00:21:28,791
Hurry, please!

394
00:21:30,083 --> 00:21:31,875
[CAYENNE]
The Infinity Punch...

395
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:34,041
I swear it came out of nowhere.

396
00:21:34,125 --> 00:21:37,125
[CAYENNE]
Yeah. Worst part was...

397
00:21:37,208 --> 00:21:38,125
I couldn't even predict it

398
00:21:38,208 --> 00:21:40,125
with my heightened
Prophecy powers.

399
00:21:40,208 --> 00:21:42,666
But how's that possible?

400
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:46,000
Could it be Aquarion
actually traveled through time?

401
00:21:46,083 --> 00:21:48,500
It begs the question...

402
00:21:48,583 --> 00:21:50,750
How truly powerful is Aquarion?

403
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:55,708
[MIKONO] Thank goodness...!
Cayenne's team is okay!

404
00:21:55,791 --> 00:21:58,791
[AMATA] Yeah but still...
What have we done?

405
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:01,208
[ZESSICA]
It was because of me.

406
00:22:01,291 --> 00:22:02,333
I'm the one who opened

407
00:22:02,416 --> 00:22:04,208
my stupid mouth
and said 'I love you'...

408
00:22:04,291 --> 00:22:06,416
That's why the
forbidden power awakened...

409
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:08,416
And why Evol
went out of control.

410
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:11,000
How could I be so selfish...?

411
00:22:11,083 --> 00:22:13,375
You could've died and it
would've been my fault.

412
00:22:18,208 --> 00:22:19,708
[MIKONO]
That guy we saw...

413
00:22:19,791 --> 00:22:21,916
He did seem awfully familiar.

414
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:26,375
[AMATA]
Was that it...?

415
00:22:26,458 --> 00:22:28,125
Did we really just witness

416
00:22:28,208 --> 00:22:31,083
what happened twelve
thousand years ago...?

417
00:22:31,166 --> 00:22:35,125
Apollo... He acted
like an animal.

418
00:22:35,208 --> 00:22:38,041
Exactly like the bastard
who's after Mikono.

419
00:22:41,916 --> 00:22:44,625
[AMATA] Can I really
fight against fate...?

420
00:22:44,708 --> 00:22:47,250
Or do I just give in?

421
00:24:23,166 --> 00:24:24,125
[SAZANKA]
What?

422
00:24:24,208 --> 00:24:25,458
The swimsuit
episode's up next...?!

423
00:24:25,541 --> 00:24:28,000
It's about time...!
Cayenne in short shorts...?

424
00:24:28,083 --> 00:24:29,875
Shrade soaking
wet and shirtless?

425
00:24:29,958 --> 00:24:33,208
I have to record
this for posterity...!

426
00:24:33,291 --> 00:24:36,291
Next time, on Aquarion Evol:
"Well Up, Life!"
