1
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:22,791
Do we know if Jin
made it out alive?

2
00:00:22,875 --> 00:00:25,458
We can't say
anything for certain,

3
00:00:25,541 --> 00:00:28,458
but we feel confident
he will be found.

4
00:00:28,541 --> 00:00:31,250
Jin was our planet's
last best hope.

5
00:00:31,333 --> 00:00:34,666
We must preserve
him at all costs.

6
00:00:35,916 --> 00:00:41,000
But that aside, after examining
the combat data he sent back,

7
00:00:41,083 --> 00:00:43,916
I think Mikage may have
been right all along.

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,500
Right about what exactly?

9
00:00:45,583 --> 00:00:49,041
The most powerful Rare Igura
that we've been searching for.

10
00:00:49,125 --> 00:00:52,166
He seems to think it's somewhere
near the Machine Angel;

11
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:54,500
apparently the odds are good.

12
00:00:58,208 --> 00:00:59,375
This is ridiculous!

13
00:00:59,458 --> 00:01:01,666
We're not authorized to
launch a counterattack?

14
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:03,125
Our orders are to stand by

15
00:01:03,208 --> 00:01:05,416
till they confirm whether
or not Jin's all right.

16
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:06,708
To hell with that.

17
00:01:06,791 --> 00:01:08,708
I'm going to Vega;
I don't care what they say!

18
00:01:08,791 --> 00:01:10,833
Yeah!

19
00:01:12,458 --> 00:01:14,583
How beautiful.

20
00:01:14,666 --> 00:01:17,500
Truth be told,
I'm a bit envious.

21
00:01:17,583 --> 00:01:22,375
Who knew our angst-ridden Odin
was so beloved by his men?

22
00:01:22,458 --> 00:01:24,041
Who're you?!

23
00:01:26,375 --> 00:01:31,000
Brave and loyal soldiers,
may hope spring eternal.

24
00:03:14,833 --> 00:03:16,541
Where are my holes?

25
00:03:16,625 --> 00:03:18,666
Someone plugged 'em up again.

26
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:22,333
And you think one
person did all this?

27
00:03:22,416 --> 00:03:24,541
I don't know, but she needs me!

28
00:03:24,625 --> 00:03:27,166
I'll find this lonely girl,
and use my tools of love

29
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:29,958
to dig a tunnel straight
to her broken heart!

30
00:03:30,041 --> 00:03:34,666
Ah jeez. You don't even
know if it's a girl yet.

31
00:03:38,791 --> 00:03:40,458
A luxurious five star restaurant

32
00:03:40,541 --> 00:03:44,208
with a breathtaking
view of the city! Wow!

33
00:03:44,291 --> 00:03:46,208
Are you going on
a date, Sazanka?

34
00:03:46,291 --> 00:03:47,666
Yeah right, in my dreams,

35
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:50,125
but I totally wish Shrade
or Cayenne would take me

36
00:03:50,208 --> 00:03:51,916
to a place like this!

37
00:03:52,625 --> 00:03:54,791
Did you just say you wish
my brother would ask you out?

38
00:03:54,875 --> 00:03:56,333
O--of course not, it's just that

39
00:03:56,416 --> 00:03:59,125
I don't have a partner like
you do, so I'm a bit lonely.

40
00:03:59,208 --> 00:04:01,666
I have a partner?

41
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:03,000
Amata?

42
00:04:03,083 --> 00:04:05,625
What're you talking about;
he isn't my partner!

43
00:04:05,708 --> 00:04:07,833
If you don't want him,
I'll take him off your hands.

44
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:13,000
Aww, look at this
cute hole in the wall.

45
00:04:14,166 --> 00:04:15,875
That is enough!

46
00:04:15,958 --> 00:04:17,583
This is clearly a
site for perverts,

47
00:04:17,666 --> 00:04:20,583
sans moral compass and with
less than virtuous intentions!

48
00:04:20,666 --> 00:04:22,500
"Hole in the wall"?

49
00:04:22,583 --> 00:04:24,833
Why you call that horrid
filth 'cute' is beyond me,

50
00:04:24,916 --> 00:04:26,833
and I'll have none of it!

51
00:04:29,333 --> 00:04:30,750
I'm confused, does anyone know

52
00:04:30,833 --> 00:04:32,458
what she's really pissed about?

53
00:04:32,541 --> 00:04:33,958
Her Dad.

54
00:04:36,833 --> 00:04:38,833
So, did we find
anything valuable

55
00:04:38,916 --> 00:04:40,583
in the Abductor's wreckage?

56
00:04:40,666 --> 00:04:42,041
Negative.

57
00:04:42,125 --> 00:04:44,125
The pilot's MIA, but he has
to be out there somewhere.

58
00:04:44,208 --> 00:04:46,250
We'll sweep till he's
found, Miss Chairwoman.

59
00:04:47,041 --> 00:04:48,958
Not the chocolate one,
that's mine...

60
00:04:49,041 --> 00:04:50,666
I already called 'dibs' on it.

61
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:52,291
Oh, sorry, didn't know.

62
00:04:54,833 --> 00:04:56,666
The boy can play.

63
00:04:56,750 --> 00:05:01,208
His melodies are
getting much brighter.

64
00:05:03,666 --> 00:05:04,875
But deep within,

65
00:05:04,958 --> 00:05:08,041
the darkness follows
its gradient to his soul.

66
00:05:20,916 --> 00:05:22,416
I know you're there.

67
00:05:25,958 --> 00:05:30,416
If you have something to say,
then get on with it.

68
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:31,958
They haven't found
a single trace

69
00:05:32,041 --> 00:05:34,208
of that pilot from
the Abductor ship.

70
00:05:34,291 --> 00:05:35,833
Don't you think
that's a little bunk?

71
00:05:35,916 --> 00:05:39,750
I don't sense a disturbance,

72
00:05:39,833 --> 00:05:42,000
though I'm glad
you consulted me.

73
00:05:42,083 --> 00:05:43,583
I'm flattered.

74
00:05:43,666 --> 00:05:47,458
Bit of unsolicited advice for
you: stick to playing Chopin.

75
00:05:47,541 --> 00:05:49,333
Battle isn't your forte.

76
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:51,375
It almost sounds
like you're worried.

77
00:05:51,458 --> 00:05:52,541
I just think the
team's better off

78
00:05:52,625 --> 00:05:54,833
without someone who's
got a death wish.

79
00:05:54,916 --> 00:05:58,375
Your sense of things is jaded.

80
00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:01,000
Soured by your
visions of darkness.

81
00:06:01,083 --> 00:06:03,375
As such, I fear you may
be deaf to the music

82
00:06:03,458 --> 00:06:05,166
of your sister's heart.

83
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:06,458
Excuse me?

84
00:06:06,541 --> 00:06:09,166
Her melody is beautiful.

85
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:12,041
If you listen, you'll hear it.

86
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:24,583
Dude, the Berlin's already gone,

87
00:06:24,666 --> 00:06:26,416
why the heck are
we still digging?

88
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:29,041
Hey, some people paint
or sculpt; but I dig.

89
00:06:29,125 --> 00:06:31,583
And the day I stop
digging is the day I die.

90
00:06:31,666 --> 00:06:34,500
Oh, right. Seriously though,

91
00:06:34,583 --> 00:06:36,750
have you ever thought
about why you do this?

92
00:06:36,833 --> 00:06:38,375
'Cause there's
always a new world

93
00:06:38,458 --> 00:06:40,916
waiting for me
on the other side.

94
00:06:43,541 --> 00:06:45,083
If you dig a tunnel
through a mountain,

95
00:06:45,166 --> 00:06:47,375
you'll discover new
places, new cultures.

96
00:06:47,458 --> 00:06:49,750
Your world expands.

97
00:06:49,833 --> 00:06:52,333
Dig down to water,
you got yourself a well.

98
00:06:52,416 --> 00:06:54,291
People rally around
holes, dude. Fact.

99
00:06:54,375 --> 00:06:56,375
It's the key to civilization.

100
00:06:56,458 --> 00:06:59,000
The story of mankind is
written on upturned earth.

101
00:06:59,083 --> 00:07:00,791
Wow, that was really profound.

102
00:07:00,875 --> 00:07:03,625
I had no idea this digging
stuff could be so deep.

103
00:07:03,708 --> 00:07:05,583
So tell me, what brave new world

104
00:07:05,666 --> 00:07:07,583
are you scratchin' toward now?

105
00:07:07,666 --> 00:07:09,791
The shower room
in the girls' dorm.

106
00:07:09,875 --> 00:07:11,291
What?

107
00:07:11,375 --> 00:07:12,708
Oh, Andy!

108
00:07:12,791 --> 00:07:14,291
Yeah, well, I'd say
that definitely falls

109
00:07:14,375 --> 00:07:16,541
into the brave category.

110
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
You're the one
plugging my holes?

111
00:07:36,083 --> 00:07:38,291
You're the one who's
been making these?

112
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:39,916
Yeah, of course, it'd be you,

113
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,500
but hey, who knows, maybe this
was meant to be, after all!

114
00:07:46,541 --> 00:07:48,666
Your powers are the
yin to my badass yang.

115
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:51,125
They attract with the
force of a black hole.

116
00:07:51,208 --> 00:07:51,916
Wait, what?

117
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,125
Your gazongas complete me!

118
00:07:56,083 --> 00:07:58,125
You don't even know
what you're saying right now!

119
00:07:58,208 --> 00:07:59,875
Try making words with
the hole in your face

120
00:07:59,958 --> 00:08:01,500
instead of the one portside!

121
00:08:01,583 --> 00:08:02,708
Au, contraire.

122
00:08:02,791 --> 00:08:05,666
I'm digging a new hole,
my love, for you!

123
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:07,750
Whoa, are you kidding me?

124
00:08:07,833 --> 00:08:11,083
It's a massive hole that'll
let me get deep inside you!

125
00:08:13,291 --> 00:08:14,375
The only hole you'll
see is the one

126
00:08:14,458 --> 00:08:16,458
I bury you in if you
come near me again!

127
00:08:16,541 --> 00:08:18,166
Hey, don't be like that!

128
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:19,791
Stop being a vandal.

129
00:08:19,875 --> 00:08:21,916
I am sick of having
to fill these in!

130
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,416
And who made you the
"Hole-Filler-Upper Queen"?

131
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,791
Those are my holes, nobody
asked you to close 'em up!

132
00:08:26,875 --> 00:08:27,958
Well, I think you've got a hole

133
00:08:28,041 --> 00:08:29,500
in that stupid head of yours.

134
00:08:29,583 --> 00:08:32,166
Swiss cheese. Your head
is made of swiss cheese!

135
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:34,166
And I can't even
look at it anymore,

136
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:36,166
so go dig a hole
to someplace else!

137
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:38,583
Yeah? Your head
is made of cheese!

138
00:08:38,666 --> 00:08:42,000
Don't you get it?
Digging holes is my life!

139
00:08:42,083 --> 00:08:44,625
Uh, guys, could you
stop fighting for a sec

140
00:08:44,708 --> 00:08:46,458
and help me outta here?

141
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:55,750
Wait, Andy and Mix?

142
00:08:55,833 --> 00:08:59,083
All due respect, this pairing's
got some holes in it.

143
00:08:59,166 --> 00:09:01,333
What are you hoping
to achieve with this?

144
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:02,833
Donar's right.

145
00:09:02,916 --> 00:09:04,083
Go on.

146
00:09:04,166 --> 00:09:07,000
People have a lot to say
about holes, don't they?

147
00:09:07,083 --> 00:09:10,000
"When you find yourself in a
hole, time to stop digging."

148
00:09:10,083 --> 00:09:12,000
"A mouse doesn't
rely on one hole."

149
00:09:12,083 --> 00:09:14,333
"Love is simply a
hole in the heart."

150
00:09:14,416 --> 00:09:16,333
Don't they say,
"bros before holes?"

151
00:09:16,416 --> 00:09:17,375
No one says that.

152
00:09:17,458 --> 00:09:19,041
Here's the point, my friends:

153
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:20,583
holes have different
connotations

154
00:09:20,666 --> 00:09:21,583
to different people,

155
00:09:21,666 --> 00:09:23,291
depending on their
point of view.

156
00:09:23,375 --> 00:09:26,250
But I don't understand,
why include Mikono?

157
00:09:26,333 --> 00:09:29,083
We're not even sure what
her elemental power is yet.

158
00:09:29,166 --> 00:09:32,333
A donut is just empty
space surrounded by a ring.

159
00:09:32,416 --> 00:09:34,500
Those were your words, Zen.

160
00:09:34,583 --> 00:09:35,833
Mikono completes the ring

161
00:09:35,916 --> 00:09:38,000
where the donut surrounds
the emptiness, right?

162
00:09:38,083 --> 00:09:41,208
Yes, but 'emptiness' is
not the same as 'nothing.'

163
00:09:41,291 --> 00:09:42,916
It's in that so
called 'nothingness'

164
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
that everything, even
existence itself, lives.

165
00:09:46,083 --> 00:09:48,000
We'll unite this
unlikely threesome

166
00:09:48,083 --> 00:09:49,583
and see if the great
mystery of the hole

167
00:09:49,666 --> 00:09:52,041
will finally get penetrated.

168
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:53,583
Why do they keep picking me?

169
00:09:53,666 --> 00:09:55,208
I'm not like the
other Vector pilots.

170
00:09:55,291 --> 00:09:57,208
I don't even know
what my power is yet.

171
00:09:57,291 --> 00:09:59,958
I'm not sure, but you did
real well in the last battle;

172
00:10:00,041 --> 00:10:01,541
you more than held your own.

173
00:10:01,625 --> 00:10:03,583
Whatever the reason,
I'm sure Commander Fudo

174
00:10:03,666 --> 00:10:05,375
and our teachers know
what they're doing.

175
00:10:05,458 --> 00:10:07,666
No! You can't make me!

176
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:09,958
No way! I will not!

177
00:10:10,041 --> 00:10:11,208
Calm down!

178
00:10:11,291 --> 00:10:13,541
Come on, you'll have to
do it one of these days.

179
00:10:13,625 --> 00:10:16,125
Why not just get it over
with and do it with Andy?

180
00:10:16,208 --> 00:10:18,875
There's no reason
for you to be upset.

181
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:21,041
No reason at all.

182
00:10:21,875 --> 00:10:23,750
I'd rather merge with
Tad-poltergeist than do it

183
00:10:23,833 --> 00:10:25,625
with that perverted,
hole digging, freak show!

184
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:30,333
Please don't make me!
I'd rather kill myself!

185
00:10:30,416 --> 00:10:31,500
All you ever talk about

186
00:10:31,583 --> 00:10:32,666
is wantin' to merge
with a girl, right?

187
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:34,833
Well, now's your chance!

188
00:10:34,916 --> 00:10:36,333
Jeez.

189
00:10:36,416 --> 00:10:37,708
Call me crazy,

190
00:10:37,791 --> 00:10:39,791
but I don't think his
heart's really in this one.

191
00:10:44,416 --> 00:10:45,958
'Kay, you guys,
it's time to merge.

192
00:10:46,041 --> 00:10:47,458
Well, are you ready or not?

193
00:10:47,541 --> 00:10:48,541
I pick not!

194
00:10:48,625 --> 00:10:50,250
No way I'm squandering
my first merge

195
00:10:50,333 --> 00:10:51,958
on a jerk like
Mister McLoudmouth!

196
00:10:52,041 --> 00:10:53,958
You take that back,
I'm not a loudmouth!

197
00:10:54,041 --> 00:10:55,791
Are too! Do you
even hear yourself?!

198
00:10:55,875 --> 00:10:56,833
Bite me!

199
00:10:56,916 --> 00:10:58,208
Don't talk to
me like that, perv!

200
00:10:58,291 --> 00:11:00,375
Guys! Will you please
stop fighting and focus?!

201
00:11:03,333 --> 00:11:05,250
Aborting the
simulation, Commander!

202
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:10,708
I'm such a screw up I can't
even get these two to merge!

203
00:11:10,791 --> 00:11:12,125
What the heck is wrong with me?!

204
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:33,791
I know we messed up,

205
00:11:33,875 --> 00:11:35,666
but this is just cruel
and unusual punishment.

206
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:37,041
Y'really think so?

207
00:11:37,125 --> 00:11:39,833
Figured you'd appreciate
the irony, Miss Smartypants.

208
00:11:39,916 --> 00:11:41,916
I hope you recognize
this isn't my fault!

209
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,583
If anyone's to blame, it's them!

210
00:11:43,666 --> 00:11:44,875
Like I'd merge with you!

211
00:11:44,958 --> 00:11:46,833
Well, it isn't
my idea of fun either.

212
00:11:46,916 --> 00:11:48,000
You're such a pain in my--

213
00:11:48,083 --> 00:11:49,750
Look, just plug your
bottles and shut up.

214
00:11:49,833 --> 00:11:51,875
Ugh, I wish you'd crawl
back in whatever hole

215
00:11:51,958 --> 00:11:54,750
you came out of and leave
civilized girls like me alone!

216
00:11:54,833 --> 00:11:56,250
Come on, what's your deal?

217
00:11:56,333 --> 00:11:59,000
Is it just me you hate,
or all dudes in general?

218
00:11:59,083 --> 00:12:00,333
What'd I do to you?

219
00:12:00,416 --> 00:12:03,500
Men, you, holes,
I hate everything!

220
00:12:03,583 --> 00:12:05,291
Well hey, if your
Dad hadn't made you

221
00:12:05,375 --> 00:12:07,083
with his ding-a-ling
you wouldn't be here.

222
00:12:07,166 --> 00:12:08,083
If it weren't for a man,

223
00:12:08,166 --> 00:12:10,208
you wouldn't even
exist, so there!

224
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:14,333
Don't talk about my Dad.

225
00:12:26,166 --> 00:12:28,791
Come on, Mikono, you can't
let them get you down.

226
00:12:28,875 --> 00:12:31,958
I could've done so
much better, I know it.

227
00:12:32,041 --> 00:12:33,458
Don't blame yourself;

228
00:12:33,541 --> 00:12:35,750
I don't think anybody could've
gotten those two together.

229
00:12:35,833 --> 00:12:38,416
Though I wonder why
Mix hates guys so much;

230
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:41,083
maybe she's had a string
of bad luck with them?

231
00:12:41,166 --> 00:12:44,291
I think I know. It's
something Zessica said.

232
00:12:44,375 --> 00:12:45,750
Yeah?

233
00:12:47,541 --> 00:12:50,666
So, her Dad was a
writer for a magazine?

234
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:53,916
Mainly reviews and guide
listings on tourist attractions.

235
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,416
He met another woman
while doing a piece

236
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:59,125
on some hole-in-the-wall bar,
and, well, same old story.

237
00:12:59,208 --> 00:13:00,916
They fell in love.

238
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:05,458
Gotcha. He walked out
on her and her mom.

239
00:13:05,541 --> 00:13:08,375
Although, everyone's
got baggage, right?

240
00:13:08,458 --> 00:13:10,291
But we find a way
to move past it,

241
00:13:10,375 --> 00:13:12,833
bury our problems
and get on with life.

242
00:13:12,916 --> 00:13:15,125
That's a hard thing
to move on from.

243
00:13:24,375 --> 00:13:25,833
One thing is for sure:

244
00:13:25,916 --> 00:13:27,666
that girl's got a
hole in her heart.

245
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:30,083
She's been trying to
fill it up for a while.

246
00:13:30,666 --> 00:13:32,166
Whoa!

247
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:34,333
Aww man! What
jackass thought digging

248
00:13:34,416 --> 00:13:36,458
a hole out here was a good idea?

249
00:13:36,541 --> 00:13:39,208
Oh, right, that was me.

250
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:57,416
Now, Machine Angel,
it's time to end this!

251
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:59,000
Vengeance for Jin!

252
00:13:59,833 --> 00:14:01,291
Talk to me, Towano.

253
00:14:01,375 --> 00:14:04,166
Why have you taken over their
minds and manipulated them?

254
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:07,083
I do not bend minds to my will.

255
00:14:07,166 --> 00:14:11,166
On the contrary,
I awaken them, nothing more.

256
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:14,125
What have you done? Tell me!

257
00:14:14,208 --> 00:14:16,041
A dream.

258
00:14:16,125 --> 00:14:17,250
I know what you're up to.

259
00:14:17,333 --> 00:14:19,458
Their dreams
mean nothing to you,

260
00:14:19,541 --> 00:14:22,166
you just want the
True Eve for yourself!

261
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:24,500
If a single bloom
commands every parcel

262
00:14:24,583 --> 00:14:28,708
of the gardener's attention,
what becomes of his garden?

263
00:14:29,583 --> 00:14:30,625
Abductors detected!

264
00:14:30,708 --> 00:14:31,916
All Elements report

265
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,083
to phase one
battle-stations immediately!

266
00:14:34,166 --> 00:14:35,833
Repeat, all Elements report

267
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:38,583
to phase one
battle--stations immediately!

268
00:14:38,666 --> 00:14:41,291
This is not typical behavior
for the Abductors.

269
00:14:41,375 --> 00:14:42,666
Their patterns are so random,

270
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:44,833
I think it's safe to say
they're up to something new.

271
00:14:44,916 --> 00:14:45,916
And they're getting closer

272
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,291
and closer to
Neo-Kowloon every day.

273
00:14:48,375 --> 00:14:49,583
There are three of them.

274
00:14:49,666 --> 00:14:52,416
We should deploy a
solid, reliable team.

275
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,083
Yes, I agree.

276
00:14:54,166 --> 00:14:56,583
Send out Andy W. Hall
as the head!

277
00:14:56,666 --> 00:14:58,500
Roger tha--! Huh?

278
00:14:58,583 --> 00:15:00,000
Yeah, that's my jam!

279
00:15:00,083 --> 00:15:02,541
Pair up Andy
with Mikono and Mix.

280
00:15:04,125 --> 00:15:06,625
This is unacceptable!
I won't merge with that creep!

281
00:15:06,708 --> 00:15:09,875
Hey! This is a real battle, Mix!

282
00:15:09,958 --> 00:15:12,708
Stop being selfish and
get out there and fight!

283
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:19,208
Easy, Mikono, you've got this.

284
00:15:25,458 --> 00:15:27,416
Vector X, ready to rock it!

285
00:15:28,916 --> 00:15:30,833
Vector Y, initiating launch!

286
00:15:32,416 --> 00:15:34,708
Vector Z, initiating launch!

287
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:43,625
I've waited a
long time for this.

288
00:15:43,708 --> 00:15:45,833
Come on ladies,
let's make some memories!

289
00:15:45,916 --> 00:15:46,666
No!

290
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:47,541
What?!

291
00:15:47,625 --> 00:15:49,125
You can't make me do this!

292
00:15:49,208 --> 00:15:50,958
I refuse to merge with a boy!

293
00:15:51,041 --> 00:15:52,750
You have to!

294
00:15:52,833 --> 00:15:54,958
I can take these
guys down myself!

295
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:01,208
Take this, jerk!

296
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:08,791
Not good!

297
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:20,125
Mix!

298
00:16:20,208 --> 00:16:20,916
Andy?

299
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,500
C'mon, get over yourself!

300
00:16:22,583 --> 00:16:23,833
Look, I don't blame you

301
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:25,500
for trying to fill the
hole in your heart, okay?

302
00:16:25,583 --> 00:16:27,375
I get it, you feel betrayed,

303
00:16:27,458 --> 00:16:28,791
but you can't blame all men

304
00:16:28,875 --> 00:16:31,041
for the bullshit
your Dad pulled!

305
00:16:31,125 --> 00:16:34,708
Don't you see,
it's like, like you're--

306
00:16:37,166 --> 00:16:39,583
It's like you're stuck inside
a hole you dug yourself!

307
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:41,791
Wha-- What does that even mean?

308
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:43,958
To fill one hole you
have to dig another.

309
00:16:44,041 --> 00:16:45,916
That's what you've
been trying to do, right?

310
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,583
But you dug too deep.

311
00:16:47,666 --> 00:16:49,708
You'll never succeed at
patching up your heart,

312
00:16:49,791 --> 00:16:53,666
not 'til you hoist up out of the
pit you've dug yourself into!

313
00:16:54,333 --> 00:16:55,666
I can help you, Mix.

314
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:57,833
You can stop digging
and use my dirt.

315
00:16:57,916 --> 00:16:59,166
Listen to me, please,

316
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:02,125
this is my first time to
full-on merge with a girl.

317
00:17:02,208 --> 00:17:05,416
And I wouldn't pick
anyone but you!

318
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:07,791
Andy.

319
00:17:07,875 --> 00:17:09,666
Come on, Mix, let's do it.

320
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:11,875
Listen to Andy, he's right.

321
00:17:11,958 --> 00:17:14,625
The Elements' aura levels
are climbing rapidly.

322
00:17:14,708 --> 00:17:18,625
Eighty, eighty-five.
Still rising, Commander!

323
00:17:23,708 --> 00:17:25,541
The hole I need to
fill is in my heart,

324
00:17:25,625 --> 00:17:27,208
but I can't do it on my own.

325
00:17:27,291 --> 00:17:29,083
Mix, Mikono, it's time.

326
00:17:29,166 --> 00:17:30,750
Roger!

327
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:32,541
Let's do it!

328
00:17:32,625 --> 00:17:37,500
Okay, Big Bang Merge!
Go! Aquarion!

329
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:47,875
Whoa! This isn't like
merging with girls at all!

330
00:17:47,958 --> 00:17:50,333
This is completely different!

331
00:17:50,416 --> 00:17:51,541
My heart feels like

332
00:17:51,625 --> 00:17:53,666
it's going to burst
right out of my chest!

333
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:56,375
It's happening!
It's finally happening!

334
00:17:56,458 --> 00:17:59,750
A whole new world
just waiting for me!

335
00:17:59,833 --> 00:18:01,375
Don't let them merge!

336
00:18:04,916 --> 00:18:07,083
That's not good! Look out!

337
00:18:10,583 --> 00:18:12,083
Andy!

338
00:18:15,708 --> 00:18:16,375
He's falling!

339
00:18:16,458 --> 00:18:17,416
Do something!

340
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:20,291
Element Change! Now!
Amata Sora, go!

341
00:18:20,375 --> 00:18:21,666
On my way!

342
00:18:31,083 --> 00:18:33,541
Andy! Are you okay?! Wake up!

343
00:18:33,625 --> 00:18:34,583
He took that hit for me.

344
00:18:34,666 --> 00:18:36,750
Mix, we have got
to merge! Right now!

345
00:18:36,833 --> 00:18:38,833
Merge with you?

346
00:18:38,916 --> 00:18:40,000
Gee, thanks, you sure know

347
00:18:40,083 --> 00:18:41,625
how to make a guy feel special!

348
00:18:41,708 --> 00:18:44,166
Please! Don't let Andy's
sacrifice be for nothing!

349
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:47,750
Can't you sense it-- the
feelings he left behind for us?

350
00:18:47,833 --> 00:18:48,958
He still wants to be the one

351
00:18:49,041 --> 00:18:51,583
to fill those holes
you have in your heart.

352
00:18:51,666 --> 00:18:53,500
You think so?

353
00:18:55,708 --> 00:18:57,416
Awright, let's do this!

354
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:02,291
Big Bang Merge,
take two! Go! Aquarion!

355
00:19:07,875 --> 00:19:09,041
We did it!

356
00:19:09,125 --> 00:19:12,208
We're connected.
My world is expanding!

357
00:19:14,416 --> 00:19:20,208
This is it. It's
so incredible. Andy?!

358
00:19:20,291 --> 00:19:23,125
I told you Andy is
still with us. See?

359
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:28,458
This is unbelievable.

360
00:19:28,541 --> 00:19:31,125
They felt such repulsion
for each other before.

361
00:19:31,208 --> 00:19:33,041
Wait. Is it possible
we've stumbled upon

362
00:19:33,125 --> 00:19:35,000
Mikono's power source?

363
00:19:35,083 --> 00:19:36,000
Could it be?

364
00:19:36,083 --> 00:19:39,916
Indeed. It's the
power to connect.

365
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,791
The power to connect.

366
00:19:46,875 --> 00:19:49,625
He's still here; I can feel him!

367
00:19:49,708 --> 00:19:51,500
He's moving through me!

368
00:19:55,333 --> 00:19:59,125
Aquarion Evol!

369
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:02,458
Do you see?

370
00:20:02,541 --> 00:20:05,708
Merging is a type of magic
which binds people together!

371
00:20:05,791 --> 00:20:09,208
Yes, it takes the relationships
that exist between the Elements.

372
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:12,875
Using their unique connection
to generate a new power!

373
00:20:16,541 --> 00:20:18,125
The Machine Angel!

374
00:20:18,208 --> 00:20:20,291
Let's kill it
right here and now!

375
00:20:20,375 --> 00:20:21,958
Weapons at the ready!

376
00:20:22,041 --> 00:20:25,541
Andy filled up my holes.
Now I'm filling his!

377
00:20:27,541 --> 00:20:30,625
Absolute Clam! Attack!

378
00:20:39,458 --> 00:20:40,791
What was that?

379
00:20:48,791 --> 00:20:49,666
Agh, what happened!

380
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:51,583
What the hell is going on here?!

381
00:20:52,666 --> 00:20:55,291
The Machine Angel's
plugging up every opening!

382
00:20:55,375 --> 00:20:57,250
Damn it! System failure!

383
00:20:59,791 --> 00:21:01,250
That was incredible.

384
00:21:01,333 --> 00:21:04,125
So this is Mix's Element power?

385
00:21:04,208 --> 00:21:05,291
Plugging the enemy's barrels,

386
00:21:05,375 --> 00:21:07,583
causing their
weapons to backfire.

387
00:21:07,666 --> 00:21:09,708
They're essentially
taking themselves out.

388
00:21:09,791 --> 00:21:12,041
It's amazing,
digging their own graves

389
00:21:12,125 --> 00:21:14,083
without even knowing it.

390
00:21:14,166 --> 00:21:18,333
We are born from dust, and
in death to dust we return.

391
00:21:18,416 --> 00:21:23,375
Behold! The sublime
power of the living grave!

392
00:21:24,625 --> 00:21:26,458
Sorry, Jin!

393
00:21:34,916 --> 00:21:35,875
I told you!

394
00:21:35,958 --> 00:21:37,375
I was digging holes
to dump trash in

395
00:21:37,458 --> 00:21:39,791
for the Commander, so get
the hell off my back already!

396
00:21:39,875 --> 00:21:42,125
Then why are you getting so
defensive?!

397
00:21:42,208 --> 00:21:44,708
I'm sorry I keep filling
'em up, but I can't help it!

398
00:21:44,791 --> 00:21:48,291
They say opposites attract.
Guess it's true.

399
00:21:48,375 --> 00:21:50,083
You helped them connect, Mikono.

400
00:21:50,166 --> 00:21:51,416
Huh?

401
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:54,125
Yeah, that is a pretty
cool power if you ask me.

402
00:21:54,208 --> 00:21:55,875
They were already
attracted to each other,

403
00:21:55,958 --> 00:21:57,708
I just gave 'em a little nudge.

404
00:21:57,791 --> 00:22:00,916
If the potential wasn't already
there, it wouldn't've worked.

405
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
C'mon, you're being too modest.

406
00:22:03,083 --> 00:22:05,291
You have a special
gift, be proud.

407
00:22:05,375 --> 00:22:08,375
I know I am, 'course
I'm a little biased.

408
00:22:26,875 --> 00:22:29,041
Ow! Ow! Get off!

409
00:22:29,125 --> 00:22:30,000
Amata!

410
00:22:31,125 --> 00:22:32,250
Amata!

411
00:22:35,458 --> 00:22:38,166
That's what I call
a hole in one.

412
00:22:45,458 --> 00:22:48,291
So that's where
the Rare Iguras live.

413
00:24:23,666 --> 00:24:25,000
What? For reals?

414
00:24:25,083 --> 00:24:26,666
We're getting
another new student?

415
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:28,208
Oh, I hope he's hot!

416
00:24:28,291 --> 00:24:29,458
'tween him and Amata,

417
00:24:29,541 --> 00:24:32,250
I can't decide which
one is top or bottom.

418
00:24:32,333 --> 00:24:35,833
Next time on Aquarion Evol:
"One-Eyed Transfer Student."
