1
00:00:15,833 --> 00:00:18,333
The latest report confirms
that our most recent batch

2
00:00:18,416 --> 00:00:21,083
from Vega is, again,
incompatible.

3
00:00:21,166 --> 00:00:22,833
Evidently the warp
transport damaged

4
00:00:22,916 --> 00:00:24,416
the Rare Iguras en route.

5
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:26,291
They are, alas,
completely ruined, sir.

6
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:33,000
Altair-- our mother world.

7
00:00:34,541 --> 00:00:38,500
Still, she rejects us.

8
00:00:38,583 --> 00:00:40,583
This is stupid.

9
00:00:40,666 --> 00:00:43,875
We need to investigate
the power at Vega's disposal.

10
00:00:43,958 --> 00:00:46,208
Jin, I want you
in charge of this.

11
00:00:46,291 --> 00:00:49,458
Seriously? Alright, fine.

12
00:00:49,541 --> 00:00:51,208
Kagura's gonna
be a pain, though.

13
00:00:51,291 --> 00:00:54,458
So handle it.
Do whatever it takes.

14
00:00:54,541 --> 00:00:56,208
It's his fault the
enemy's managed

15
00:00:56,291 --> 00:00:59,000
to wrangle a powerful
ally from sleep.

16
00:02:57,541 --> 00:02:58,875
Where am I?

17
00:03:01,375 --> 00:03:02,875
Mikono!

18
00:03:02,958 --> 00:03:04,583
No. Cayenne.

19
00:03:06,708 --> 00:03:08,333
It's you!

20
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:11,666
The brass've ordered me to
give you a tour of the place.

21
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:13,041
Move it.

22
00:03:13,125 --> 00:03:14,458
Whoa, wait just one second,

23
00:03:14,541 --> 00:03:16,500
what the hell am
I doing here exactly?!

24
00:03:16,583 --> 00:03:17,708
And where's Mikono?!

25
00:03:17,791 --> 00:03:20,083
First of all, lay off
with the questions.

26
00:03:20,166 --> 00:03:22,125
Running your mouth is
only gonna annoy me.

27
00:03:22,208 --> 00:03:25,291
Keep it shut; I'll tell you
everything you need to know.

28
00:03:25,375 --> 00:03:29,125
This is Neo-DEAVA's
Holy Angel Academy.

29
00:03:29,208 --> 00:03:32,541
It's where we're trained as
Elements to pilot the Aquarias.

30
00:03:32,625 --> 00:03:35,208
Mikono was telling me
about this place.

31
00:03:35,291 --> 00:03:37,541
People with the potential
to be Elements come here

32
00:03:37,625 --> 00:03:40,375
from all over the world to
see if they have what it takes.

33
00:03:40,458 --> 00:03:42,041
The Abductors have
come a long way

34
00:03:42,125 --> 00:03:44,000
to make things
uncomfortable for us.

35
00:03:44,083 --> 00:03:45,875
Our mission is to stop them.

36
00:03:45,958 --> 00:03:48,333
And if you need the
bathroom, Lo and behold.

37
00:03:48,416 --> 00:03:50,416
Do you have to walk so fast?

38
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,166
This is the lecture hall.

39
00:03:54,708 --> 00:03:56,458
It's him. Look!

40
00:03:56,541 --> 00:03:58,416
That guy managed
to hijack an Aquaria.

41
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,958
Anybody know what his
power's supposed to be?

42
00:04:01,041 --> 00:04:03,000
Dude, did you hear
he merged with a girl?!

43
00:04:03,083 --> 00:04:05,333
Aww man. Lucky bastard!

44
00:04:05,416 --> 00:04:08,166
I'd get used to it.

45
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:11,250
You're a civilian who piloted
an Aquaria without training

46
00:04:11,333 --> 00:04:13,500
and merged with someone
of the opposite sex.

47
00:04:13,583 --> 00:04:15,666
That kinda thing stirs
up a lot of talk.

48
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:17,541
You and that girl
you merged with.

49
00:04:17,625 --> 00:04:18,958
You're their heroes.

50
00:04:19,041 --> 00:04:20,291
And Mikono?

51
00:04:21,958 --> 00:04:24,500
That is the Berlin.

52
00:04:24,583 --> 00:04:26,166
The act of merging between boys

53
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:28,916
and girls is strictly
forbidden here.

54
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,458
At Neo-DEAVA, this wall is used

55
00:04:30,541 --> 00:04:32,666
to keep the sexes apart
from one another,

56
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:36,916
make sure the rules are strictly
observed. Mikono is safe.

57
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,666
She's being examined on the
other side of the Berlin.

58
00:04:40,458 --> 00:04:41,750
This is the cafeteria.

59
00:04:41,833 --> 00:04:43,583
Back up. Examined how?

60
00:04:43,666 --> 00:04:45,083
What I say about that mouth?

61
00:04:45,166 --> 00:04:48,625
Tour's over. How 'bout you
answer some questions for me?

62
00:04:48,708 --> 00:04:51,041
What's going on
between you and Mikono?

63
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:53,708
Whoa, I think you
got the wrong idea.

64
00:04:53,791 --> 00:04:54,958
There's nothing going on,

65
00:04:55,041 --> 00:04:56,583
I mean, we just met
yesterday and--

66
00:04:56,666 --> 00:05:01,708
Yeah, right. What, do you think
I was born yesterday, asshole?

67
00:05:01,791 --> 00:05:03,041
First, you're hurting me.

68
00:05:03,125 --> 00:05:05,625
And second, I don't see
how that's your business!

69
00:05:05,708 --> 00:05:08,041
Wait a sec. So then
you and Mikono are--

70
00:05:08,125 --> 00:05:10,375
That's right.
And don't forget it!

71
00:05:13,291 --> 00:05:15,875
My first crush... crushed.

72
00:05:15,958 --> 00:05:17,666
Makes sense.

73
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:19,833
Of course a girl as beautiful
and perfect as Mikono

74
00:05:19,916 --> 00:05:21,208
already has someone.

75
00:05:21,291 --> 00:05:24,000
She's always been shy,
ever since we were children.

76
00:05:24,083 --> 00:05:25,541
Oh, since you were children?

77
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:27,541
Huh, love at first sight.

78
00:05:27,625 --> 00:05:29,083
That sounds so romantic.

79
00:05:29,166 --> 00:05:31,333
Every descendant of the
Suzushiro bloodline

80
00:05:31,416 --> 00:05:32,708
became an Element.

81
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:35,166
I am, my parents,
and theirs before them.

82
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:39,291
Great, you're from noble blood,
too. What a perfect match.

83
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:43,291
Not Mikono.
Unfortunately for her,

84
00:05:43,375 --> 00:05:45,125
my sister never
developed a power.

85
00:05:45,208 --> 00:05:49,541
What does your sister
have to do with-- oh--oh!

86
00:05:49,625 --> 00:05:51,458
Since she was the
only member of our family

87
00:05:51,541 --> 00:05:55,583
who didn't have abilities,
she mostly kept to herself.

88
00:05:55,666 --> 00:05:57,500
She was so terrified
of the Abductors,

89
00:05:57,583 --> 00:05:59,208
she wouldn't so much as
step out the front door

90
00:05:59,291 --> 00:06:00,750
without me by her side.

91
00:06:00,833 --> 00:06:04,041
Really? That doesn't
sound like her.

92
00:06:04,125 --> 00:06:05,541
Well, I'm not just gonna hide

93
00:06:05,625 --> 00:06:07,750
while I wait for them
to gatecrash again.

94
00:06:07,833 --> 00:06:10,875
If today's all I have,
why not enjoy it?

95
00:06:10,958 --> 00:06:14,333
Mikono's too much of a coward
to get into a Vector on her own.

96
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:17,541
Poor thing just doesn't
have what it takes.

97
00:06:18,291 --> 00:06:21,166
Look, I realize I haven't known
her as long as you have,

98
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:23,750
but I think she's
changed since then.

99
00:06:23,833 --> 00:06:25,166
Cut her some slack.

100
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:26,500
What?

101
00:06:26,583 --> 00:06:28,875
You may think she's a
coward, but you're wrong.

102
00:06:28,958 --> 00:06:31,791
Mikono's brave and she's
trying to be a stronger person!

103
00:06:34,291 --> 00:06:37,125
I musta neglected to say,
'in my humble opinion,'

104
00:06:37,208 --> 00:06:38,791
because clearly you know best--

105
00:06:38,875 --> 00:06:40,166
You little shit!

106
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:42,666
That's enough! Keep it down,
gents, you're at a ten,

107
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:44,208
and we need you at a two.

108
00:06:44,291 --> 00:06:47,416
Unless you want me twirlin'
your insides like this pasta.

109
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:48,458
Commander Donar?

110
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:50,083
Commander?!

111
00:06:50,833 --> 00:06:52,208
Get ready, newbie.

112
00:06:52,291 --> 00:06:55,041
We're gonna put you through
the ringer this afternoon.

113
00:06:55,125 --> 00:06:56,958
I'd eat up if I were you.

114
00:06:57,041 --> 00:06:59,291
Our tests will determine
whether we keep you here,

115
00:06:59,375 --> 00:07:00,875
or kick you to the curb.

116
00:07:00,958 --> 00:07:02,250
If you wanna be a pilot,

117
00:07:02,333 --> 00:07:04,250
you'd better show us
what you're made of.

118
00:07:04,333 --> 00:07:07,166
You're actually gonna make me
a pilot for one of the Aquarias?

119
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:09,416
Not just any ol' pilot, kiddo.

120
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:12,083
You've gone and broken
the Guize Stone seal.

121
00:07:12,166 --> 00:07:14,791
You pilot Aquarion.

122
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:22,791
At the moment,

123
00:07:22,875 --> 00:07:24,250
there's nothing particularly
wrong with his body.

124
00:07:24,333 --> 00:07:26,291
His vital signs are normal.

125
00:07:26,375 --> 00:07:28,875
It would appear his special
power is anti-gravity.

126
00:07:28,958 --> 00:07:31,708
Every time he experiences
a sudden surge in emotion,

127
00:07:31,791 --> 00:07:35,208
whether positive or negative,
his body begins to levitate.

128
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,208
It's too much!

129
00:07:44,458 --> 00:07:46,500
I guess it's safe to
say the kid's anything

130
00:07:46,583 --> 00:07:48,041
but down to earth,

131
00:07:48,125 --> 00:07:50,125
but the fact that he can fly
still doesn't help to explain

132
00:07:50,208 --> 00:07:53,208
how his aura managed to
override the Guize Stones.

133
00:07:53,291 --> 00:07:57,625
Something besides his
element must have caused it.

134
00:07:58,166 --> 00:08:00,916
That's probably true, but
regardless of how it happened,

135
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,500
with what we're up against,
Aquarion's the only chance

136
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:05,458
we have of turning the tide.

137
00:08:05,541 --> 00:08:07,916
I'm gonna have to disagree
with you there, sir.

138
00:08:08,375 --> 00:08:09,708
It's a bad idea.

139
00:08:09,791 --> 00:08:12,958
We're flirting with
disaster even considering it!

140
00:08:13,041 --> 00:08:14,541
What?

141
00:08:18,125 --> 00:08:20,500
Um, is this machine safe?

142
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:24,125
You'll be fine. Just relax
and accept whatever you see.

143
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:30,625
The kid. He called
out Aquarion's name.

144
00:08:30,708 --> 00:08:32,583
He was able to master Evol,

145
00:08:32,666 --> 00:08:35,750
a completely unknown form,
on his first go 'round.

146
00:08:35,833 --> 00:08:39,708
And, I might add,
he walked away a winner.

147
00:08:39,791 --> 00:08:41,833
Aquarion lives inside him.

148
00:08:41,916 --> 00:08:45,708
Its memories are a key thread
in the fabric of his being.

149
00:08:51,166 --> 00:08:54,291
Light level falling to twenty
thousand and stabilizing.

150
00:08:54,375 --> 00:08:57,750
Confirmed. The waveform is
going from magenta to cyan.

151
00:09:04,583 --> 00:09:09,208
Hang on! Wait! Please!
Tell me where you're going!

152
00:09:10,833 --> 00:09:12,541
No!

153
00:09:13,208 --> 00:09:16,416
Please! Don't be scared!

154
00:09:20,666 --> 00:09:22,666
No! No!

155
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:28,583
Don't leave me!

156
00:09:36,666 --> 00:09:39,000
Stop this! Shut down
the machine right now!

157
00:09:39,083 --> 00:09:40,625
What the hell just happened?!

158
00:09:40,708 --> 00:09:42,041
I'm not sure!

159
00:09:42,125 --> 00:09:44,458
It appears something is
interfering with the scanner!

160
00:09:44,541 --> 00:09:46,083
Until we sort it out,
we're not going to be able

161
00:09:46,166 --> 00:09:48,500
to probe his
memories any further.

162
00:09:49,708 --> 00:09:53,208
What could possibly
be causing this?

163
00:09:56,041 --> 00:09:57,416
So, did you hear?

164
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:00,000
Apparently there was a union
between a boy and a girl!

165
00:10:00,083 --> 00:10:04,083
I know, and Zessica was in it,
that's so crazy, right?!

166
00:10:06,208 --> 00:10:08,375
Skirts've gotten a lot shorter.

167
00:10:10,333 --> 00:10:12,708
Zess, you're
totally the coolest!

168
00:10:12,791 --> 00:10:15,500
You got to merge with
a boy. I am so jealous!

169
00:10:15,583 --> 00:10:17,916
And not just any boy,
you merged with Cayenne!

170
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,750
I know! Cayenne's totally
the cutest guy in school;

171
00:10:20,833 --> 00:10:22,458
he's awesome at
like, everything!

172
00:10:22,541 --> 00:10:24,041
I think Shrade's way hotter.

173
00:10:24,125 --> 00:10:25,375
I don't care if
he doesn't fight,

174
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:27,458
I'm more into the
artsy mysterious type.

175
00:10:27,541 --> 00:10:29,250
Don't worry,
we won't be here long.

176
00:10:29,333 --> 00:10:32,208
They'll examine me and discover
I don't have any special power,

177
00:10:32,291 --> 00:10:34,125
and then we'll be out
the door and on our way!

178
00:10:37,625 --> 00:10:39,541
It's just like usual.

179
00:10:39,625 --> 00:10:42,916
They're all heroes
and I'm regular old me.

180
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,791
So, we're dying to know, what
was it like to do it with a boy?

181
00:10:48,208 --> 00:10:50,916
Well, it was intense.

182
00:10:53,583 --> 00:10:55,708
Wow, I wanna do
it with a boy, too!

183
00:10:55,791 --> 00:10:58,458
Actually, at this point I'd
settle for just meeting one!

184
00:10:58,541 --> 00:11:01,458
Ugh. If only that dumb
wall could be ripped down!

185
00:11:01,541 --> 00:11:03,125
Enough!

186
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:09,583
You should be ashamed talking
about tearing the Berlin down;

187
00:11:09,666 --> 00:11:11,166
it's here to protect us!

188
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:14,458
Without that barrier in place,
our world would turn to chaos!

189
00:11:14,541 --> 00:11:15,875
Hey, relax.

190
00:11:15,958 --> 00:11:18,041
She's right, Mix, lighten
up a little bit, will ya?

191
00:11:18,125 --> 00:11:21,208
I will not!
Those men have tainted you!

192
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:23,208
Hold on just a second.

193
00:11:23,291 --> 00:11:25,583
I hope you're not trying to
imply that Cayenne's tainted!

194
00:11:25,666 --> 00:11:27,083
Fools.

195
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:31,333
Mikono Suzushiro!

196
00:11:31,416 --> 00:11:33,000
Did she say Suzushiro?

197
00:11:33,083 --> 00:11:37,458
You're kidding me, that's
Cayenne's sister? No way!

198
00:11:38,166 --> 00:11:39,250
Tell them, Mikono.

199
00:11:39,333 --> 00:11:40,541
All boys are disgusting,

200
00:11:40,625 --> 00:11:42,375
s'not like your
brother's the exception!

201
00:11:42,458 --> 00:11:44,000
I bet he even keeps
dirty magazines

202
00:11:44,083 --> 00:11:45,833
under his bed, the pervert!

203
00:11:45,916 --> 00:11:47,166
I really wouldn't know.

204
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:49,875
I mean, we haven't lived
together for a while.

205
00:11:49,958 --> 00:11:51,666
Well, that doesn't matter.

206
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:53,833
Don't you know you can use
your power to get in his head

207
00:11:53,916 --> 00:11:56,125
and dig up all sorts
of stuff about him?

208
00:11:56,583 --> 00:11:57,958
Sibling Elements
have an unusually

209
00:11:58,041 --> 00:11:59,500
high telepathic resonance,

210
00:11:59,583 --> 00:12:02,041
therefore, even if you're apart,
you should be able to use--

211
00:12:02,125 --> 00:12:03,541
I can't!

212
00:12:04,333 --> 00:12:06,250
It's not my thing.

213
00:12:06,333 --> 00:12:09,125
All I'm good for it is
staying out of the way.

214
00:12:09,208 --> 00:12:11,416
Compared to him, I'm nothing.

215
00:12:33,041 --> 00:12:35,000
A serenade of deep regret.

216
00:12:38,333 --> 00:12:41,500
Mikono's just on the
other side of that wall.

217
00:12:41,583 --> 00:12:43,375
Sucks knowing she's so close.

218
00:12:43,458 --> 00:12:46,166
I really wish there was
some way I could see her.

219
00:12:50,875 --> 00:12:52,458
Piano?

220
00:13:07,625 --> 00:13:09,083
It must be up there.

221
00:13:16,625 --> 00:13:18,458
Hello?!

222
00:13:19,125 --> 00:13:21,958
Whoa. Hey, you're the
new kid, aren't you?

223
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,583
Dig in. Nuthin'
like sharing a meal

224
00:13:24,666 --> 00:13:26,500
with a strange dude
in a dark hole, right?

225
00:13:26,583 --> 00:13:28,166
Umm, thank you?

226
00:13:32,291 --> 00:13:34,833
On that note...
Why is there a hole here?

227
00:13:34,916 --> 00:13:37,958
Huh? Sweet salvation!

228
00:13:38,041 --> 00:13:40,583
Oh, okay. So just you down here?

229
00:13:40,666 --> 00:13:42,833
You dug this whole
tunnel yourself?

230
00:13:48,458 --> 00:13:50,250
Boom. There it is.

231
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:56,875
Did you just feel the earth?

232
00:13:56,958 --> 00:14:00,166
Yep. S'my elemental power!

233
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:01,958
That's incredible.

234
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:03,375
You're damn right it is.

235
00:14:03,458 --> 00:14:05,916
Everything that exists has
a weakness I can suss out.

236
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,875
Just begging for some guy
to come along and dig in,

237
00:14:08,958 --> 00:14:11,041
and that's where my
talent comes into play.

238
00:14:11,125 --> 00:14:12,666
I find those weak
spots and give 'em

239
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:15,208
what they really want,
if you know what I mean.

240
00:14:15,666 --> 00:14:17,875
Well, how 'bout that?

241
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:20,791
There are others like me here.

242
00:14:21,125 --> 00:14:22,750
Let's dig the shit out
of this tunnel, dude;

243
00:14:22,833 --> 00:14:24,000
cause on the other side,

244
00:14:24,083 --> 00:14:26,208
there'll be a whole slew
of babes ready to merge!

245
00:14:26,291 --> 00:14:27,416
The girls' side?

246
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:28,833
Wait a sec; you're
seriously telling me

247
00:14:28,916 --> 00:14:29,958
that's where this hole leads?

248
00:14:30,041 --> 00:14:31,291
You know it!

249
00:14:31,375 --> 00:14:33,125
My other name for it's
the Tunnel of Love, baby!

250
00:14:33,208 --> 00:14:35,250
Start burrowing so we
can get our merge on!

251
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:37,791
I'm in, dude.

252
00:14:37,875 --> 00:14:38,958
I can't tell you
how awesome it is

253
00:14:39,041 --> 00:14:40,625
you're my partner
in crime on this.

254
00:14:40,708 --> 00:14:42,541
Oh yeah, the name's
Andy W. Hall.

255
00:14:42,625 --> 00:14:46,125
And from this day forward, you
are gonna be my number one 'DB!'

256
00:14:46,208 --> 00:14:48,125
Um, what does 'DB?' mean?

257
00:14:48,208 --> 00:14:50,416
Diggin' Bro, bro!

258
00:14:55,458 --> 00:14:58,416
Mikono. Come on. Dig for her!

259
00:15:06,541 --> 00:15:08,291
So beautiful.

260
00:15:12,666 --> 00:15:17,458
Amata. I sure hope
he's here somewhere.

261
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:21,625
He must be. I know it.

262
00:15:22,458 --> 00:15:24,458
He was so easy to talk to.

263
00:15:24,541 --> 00:15:26,375
I could be myself around him.

264
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:29,750
I've never felt that
close to someone before.

265
00:15:29,833 --> 00:15:31,750
But now he's gone.

266
00:15:31,833 --> 00:15:37,916
Amata has been chosen.
And I- I won't be.

267
00:15:42,458 --> 00:15:46,875
We busted our way right through
that hole. Diggin' bros!

268
00:15:53,916 --> 00:15:55,833
Uh, what are you doing?

269
00:15:55,916 --> 00:15:58,500
Uh. Digging a tunnel.

270
00:16:05,541 --> 00:16:06,916
Dude!

271
00:16:08,708 --> 00:16:10,625
Let me down!

272
00:16:10,708 --> 00:16:12,291
Stop squirming, please!

273
00:16:23,166 --> 00:16:26,291
Dude, I know you were all
excited about makin' a hole,

274
00:16:26,375 --> 00:16:28,583
but I didn't expect
you to go that deep.

275
00:16:28,666 --> 00:16:31,333
No, it was an accident, I swear.

276
00:16:32,666 --> 00:16:35,166
How could you?! You pervert!

277
00:16:36,041 --> 00:16:38,583
Wait! Mikono.

278
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,458
Hey. Don't let it get you down.

279
00:16:44,541 --> 00:16:46,791
Trust me, it happens
to the best of us, right?

280
00:16:46,875 --> 00:16:48,041
You know how it goes.

281
00:16:48,125 --> 00:16:49,583
You get your head
stuck in a skirt

282
00:16:49,666 --> 00:16:53,750
and then you levitate and--
no, that was pretty messed up.

283
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:58,333
Damn it. Let's get outta here!

284
00:17:05,333 --> 00:17:07,916
It's time for our monthly
exhibition mock battle!

285
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,625
The Elements will
be Andy W. Hall.

286
00:17:10,708 --> 00:17:11,375
Yo!

287
00:17:11,458 --> 00:17:13,375
Cayenne Suzushiro.

288
00:17:13,458 --> 00:17:18,333
And at the head, our
newest recruit, Amata Sora!

289
00:17:20,166 --> 00:17:21,333
Not Cayenne?

290
00:17:21,416 --> 00:17:22,916
What's that about?

291
00:17:32,458 --> 00:17:34,875
Man, I can't believe
I pulled that with Mikono.

292
00:17:34,958 --> 00:17:37,375
But s'not like
I did it on purpose.

293
00:17:37,458 --> 00:17:40,083
This'll take some serious
groveling to make right.

294
00:17:40,875 --> 00:17:42,958
Begin simulation!

295
00:17:43,041 --> 00:17:46,291
Yo. Time to get
our merge on 'DB!'

296
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:55,541
Amata Sora's spirit
level is failing to rise!

297
00:17:55,625 --> 00:17:57,708
At this rate,
a merge'll be impossible!

298
00:17:57,791 --> 00:18:00,083
Merge! Like your
life depends on it!

299
00:18:00,166 --> 00:18:01,541
Come on, dude, step it up!

300
00:18:01,625 --> 00:18:03,708
I know doing this with us
isn't nearly as exciting

301
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:06,208
as doin' the 'M' with a chick,
but now's not the time!

302
00:18:06,291 --> 00:18:07,666
No, that's not what I--

303
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:14,666
Listen up! You keep flying away

304
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:17,375
from 'em like this,
we won't be able to merge!

305
00:18:18,041 --> 00:18:19,250
This is just pathetic.

306
00:18:19,333 --> 00:18:20,625
From this display,
it's hard to believe

307
00:18:20,708 --> 00:18:23,416
he's the same boy who
broke the Guize Stone seal.

308
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:26,666
Come on, Amata.
Why're you holding back?

309
00:18:28,958 --> 00:18:30,708
This sucks. My first
time in three months.

310
00:18:30,791 --> 00:18:32,875
And I can't even wave
to the freaking crowd

311
00:18:32,958 --> 00:18:35,041
'cause this DB
won't get it together!

312
00:18:35,375 --> 00:18:36,500
Hold on, crowd?

313
00:18:36,583 --> 00:18:38,125
You know the girls are
watching you screw

314
00:18:38,208 --> 00:18:39,541
this all to hell, right?

315
00:18:41,625 --> 00:18:43,083
Ugh. Boriiiing.

316
00:18:43,166 --> 00:18:44,041
That's an understatement.

317
00:18:44,125 --> 00:18:45,416
Can we like, change the channel?

318
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:46,750
See! Now you know!

319
00:18:46,833 --> 00:18:50,000
It's just like I said,
men-folk are worthless.

320
00:18:50,083 --> 00:18:51,333
Not all of 'em!

321
00:18:51,416 --> 00:18:53,583
If Cayenne goes down,
it's that new kid's fault!

322
00:18:55,208 --> 00:18:57,958
That means Mikono's watching me.

323
00:18:58,666 --> 00:19:00,208
Get your head in the game!

324
00:19:00,291 --> 00:19:01,375
I know what to do!

325
00:19:01,458 --> 00:19:04,541
Yeah, I have to tell
Mikono right now!

326
00:19:06,416 --> 00:19:09,416
Sir, Amata's aura level
has begun rising rapidly!

327
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:12,375
Guess the kid's
finally in the game!

328
00:19:15,916 --> 00:19:21,000
Spiritual union. Go! Aquarion!

329
00:19:46,333 --> 00:19:48,666
Yeah, how the hell's he
gonna recover after all that?

330
00:19:53,458 --> 00:19:56,125
Now's the time.
That's it, Amata!

331
00:19:56,208 --> 00:19:58,416
Show us what
you're really capable of.

332
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:09,208
Mikono. Mikono! Mikono!!!

333
00:20:11,625 --> 00:20:12,708
Feel that power?

334
00:20:12,791 --> 00:20:14,333
How fast are we going?!

335
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:19,125
It's flying!

336
00:20:19,208 --> 00:20:20,541
Do it, Amata.

337
00:20:23,583 --> 00:20:24,916
Come on, let's finish this!

338
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,166
Don't forget to
give 'em a good show!

339
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:30,041
All right then.
Hold onto your seats, you guys!

340
00:20:35,625 --> 00:20:38,000
Mikono, I'm doing this for you!

341
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:53,625
Whoa. What the hell'd he do?

342
00:20:53,708 --> 00:20:56,666
Amazing, a defensive stance that
deflects all incoming attacks!

343
00:20:56,750 --> 00:21:00,166
Wait. What is this? He's--

344
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:07,333
Bowing his head.

345
00:21:21,541 --> 00:21:22,875
It looks like Amata's move was

346
00:21:22,958 --> 00:21:25,791
so unexpected the entire
program's breaking down!

347
00:21:26,333 --> 00:21:28,666
I'm killing the
simulation now, sir.

348
00:21:30,166 --> 00:21:31,875
What the hell
was that all about?

349
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:34,791
Total opposite of a
good show. That sucked.

350
00:21:34,875 --> 00:21:38,083
Listen up, jerk! We are
gonna have words later!

351
00:21:38,166 --> 00:21:40,916
What the hell? He's insane.

352
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Who bows in the
middle of a fight?!

353
00:21:43,083 --> 00:21:45,916
Well, apparently he does.

354
00:22:14,791 --> 00:22:19,291
All right then. Time for
me to go to the Holy Land.

355
00:22:24,083 --> 00:22:27,166
It's been two years since
we took over the warp roads.

356
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:29,791
He has to wake up soon.

357
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:31,583
He once served us well,

358
00:22:31,666 --> 00:22:35,416
but now he sleeps, and
the world turns without him.

359
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,958
That old geezer Izumo
is getting serious now.

360
00:22:42,375 --> 00:22:44,541
You should probably
wake up soon.

361
00:22:44,625 --> 00:22:47,583
What's it gonna take, Mikage?

362
00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:25,500
Men on one side.
Women on the other.

363
00:24:25,583 --> 00:24:29,291
A ponderous wall stands between
two halves of the same dilemma.

364
00:24:29,375 --> 00:24:32,333
Who has the courage to
flout tradition and level it?

365
00:24:32,416 --> 00:24:36,291
Next time on Aquarion Evol:
"The Wall -- Conquer Oneself."
