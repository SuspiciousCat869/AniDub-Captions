1
00:00:16,541 --> 00:00:18,416
Love must yet be sin!

2
00:00:24,416 --> 00:00:26,500
So, who's captain eye-patch?

3
00:00:26,583 --> 00:00:27,833
One of the brass, maybe?

4
00:00:27,916 --> 00:00:30,083
Umm, why is he
dressed like a pirate?

5
00:00:30,166 --> 00:00:32,416
What do you mean love is a sin?!

6
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:34,333
Yeah, the walls
just got torn down!

7
00:00:34,416 --> 00:00:35,750
Hell no! This sucks!

8
00:00:35,833 --> 00:00:37,166
Come on! Screw that!

9
00:00:49,041 --> 00:00:51,750
Welcome, Miss Chairwoman,
glad you're back.

10
00:00:52,625 --> 00:00:53,958
Is he serious?

11
00:01:03,375 --> 00:01:05,833
Refreshments,
just for you, ma'am.

12
00:01:05,916 --> 00:01:07,250
Very kind.

13
00:01:07,333 --> 00:01:09,708
So, this little girl
is the chairwoman?

14
00:01:09,791 --> 00:01:12,666
Indeed, and this
is her companion--

15
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:16,541
Neo-DEAVA's High
Commander Zen Fudo.

16
00:01:19,791 --> 00:01:21,833
The Chairman and High Commander
have journeyed together

17
00:01:21,916 --> 00:01:24,125
for quite some time,
attempting to solve

18
00:01:24,208 --> 00:01:26,625
the Aquarion's deeper mysteries.

19
00:01:26,708 --> 00:01:29,291
I take your return
to be a good omen?

20
00:01:29,375 --> 00:01:32,041
You must've found something
if you've come back.

21
00:01:32,666 --> 00:01:35,208
Personally, I'm in the
dark regarding all this.

22
00:01:35,291 --> 00:01:38,916
Speaking only for myself, of
course, Aquarion is mystifying.

23
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,583
Miss Suomi, are you
familiar with the story

24
00:01:41,666 --> 00:01:43,416
of Apollon and Silvie?

25
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:44,833
Yes, of course.

26
00:01:44,916 --> 00:01:47,375
It's a famous fairy tale,
every child has heard it.

27
00:01:47,458 --> 00:01:49,458
I think there was a
movie not long ago.

28
00:01:49,541 --> 00:01:52,000
'Skies of Aquaria,'
if memory serves.

29
00:01:52,083 --> 00:01:53,250
Correct.

30
00:01:53,333 --> 00:01:55,041
Some believe as a
condition of their victory

31
00:01:55,125 --> 00:01:57,000
over the forces of darkness,

32
00:01:57,083 --> 00:02:00,458
Apollon and Silvie were ripped
apart, never to meet again.

33
00:02:00,541 --> 00:02:03,416
But fierce passions
are dangerous.

34
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:06,541
Unchecked, they can
herald destruction.

35
00:02:06,625 --> 00:02:08,833
The brave lovers
are still divided,

36
00:02:08,916 --> 00:02:11,083
and still yearn to
embrace one another.

37
00:02:11,166 --> 00:02:12,916
These unresolved
feelings are what cause

38
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,875
the current Aquarion to
malfunction and go berserk.

39
00:02:15,958 --> 00:02:17,291
Berserk?

40
00:02:17,375 --> 00:02:18,541
More or less.

41
00:02:18,625 --> 00:02:20,375
Which is exactly
why Neo-DEAVA chose

42
00:02:20,458 --> 00:02:23,291
to place the machine's
full power under a seal.

43
00:02:23,375 --> 00:02:26,250
You of course already
know this, Mr. Donar.

44
00:02:26,333 --> 00:02:29,083
I do. Wish I could say I didn't.

45
00:02:29,166 --> 00:02:30,500
Our enemy grows stronger

46
00:02:30,583 --> 00:02:32,708
and more fierce with
each passing day.

47
00:02:32,791 --> 00:02:34,333
To have even a
chance at survival,

48
00:02:34,416 --> 00:02:36,791
Neo-DEAVA must
rethink its strategies.

49
00:02:36,875 --> 00:02:39,500
True. We have no other choice.

50
00:02:39,583 --> 00:02:43,125
It seems the forbidden powers
are our only recourse.

51
00:02:45,375 --> 00:02:48,666
Curious how pastries lend
themselves to metaphor.

52
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:50,750
I suggest, Mr. Dantes,

53
00:02:50,833 --> 00:02:53,958
that you eat the empty
space defining your center.

54
00:02:54,041 --> 00:02:56,083
Before it eats you.

55
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:53,583
Sir, Izumo wants
to see you. Wait!

56
00:04:53,666 --> 00:04:55,416
Is that really
what I think it is?

57
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:56,708
Where in the world did you get

58
00:04:56,791 --> 00:04:58,541
an exact
reproduction of Alisia--?

59
00:05:00,625 --> 00:05:03,125
What does he want. Well?

60
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:15,833
What is it?

61
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:18,333
Jin, we've just finished
analyzing the data

62
00:05:18,416 --> 00:05:20,541
you brought back to us.

63
00:05:20,625 --> 00:05:22,916
Your preliminary
theory proved correct.

64
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,625
The Machine Angel's
parameters depend on its form.

65
00:05:26,708 --> 00:05:28,166
Told you so.

66
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:30,041
After the transformation,

67
00:05:30,125 --> 00:05:33,666
it fought like a completely
different animal than before.

68
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:36,416
What's more,
during the last attack,

69
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,750
we detected something else:

70
00:05:38,833 --> 00:05:41,958
strong readings
consistent with a Rare Igura.

71
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:44,625
You're telling me a
Rare Igura was inside it?

72
00:05:46,291 --> 00:05:47,708
Excuse me, sir,

73
00:05:47,791 --> 00:05:50,250
Kagura Demuri has just
deployed his Mithra Gnis.

74
00:05:50,333 --> 00:05:52,333
What an impetuous fool!

75
00:05:52,416 --> 00:05:55,208
Does he plan to conquer
Vega on his own?

76
00:05:55,708 --> 00:05:57,208
Sir, the Dimension Gate!

77
00:05:57,291 --> 00:05:58,416
Damn it.

78
00:06:02,083 --> 00:06:04,916
The Mithra Gnis has entered
inter-dimensional space!

79
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,958
I wanna know who
opened that thing!

80
00:06:08,416 --> 00:06:11,916
No, wait. He can't
have awoken yet...

81
00:06:37,458 --> 00:06:39,291
Listen up, everybody.

82
00:06:39,375 --> 00:06:42,541
Starting today,
Holy Angel Academy is co-ed.

83
00:06:42,625 --> 00:06:45,208
That means from now
on you'll all learn together.

84
00:06:45,291 --> 00:06:48,708
Now, I realize it might take
you some time to adjust,

85
00:06:48,791 --> 00:06:52,125
but I trust you will all
comport yourselves like adults.

86
00:06:55,083 --> 00:06:58,208
Wow! It's Shrade in the flesh.

87
00:07:00,916 --> 00:07:02,958
Even the air is polluted now.

88
00:07:03,333 --> 00:07:04,375
Your first assignment together

89
00:07:04,458 --> 00:07:06,666
is something of a
social experiment.

90
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:08,333
You will venture out
into Neo-Kowloon

91
00:07:08,416 --> 00:07:09,875
in mixed gender teams.

92
00:07:09,958 --> 00:07:11,333
Understood?

93
00:07:11,416 --> 00:07:13,375
Trip sounds like a complete
waste of everyone's time,

94
00:07:13,458 --> 00:07:14,541
if you ask me.

95
00:07:14,625 --> 00:07:16,083
Booya! Look out, ladies!

96
00:07:16,166 --> 00:07:18,375
Your knight in
shining armor is here!

97
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:21,125
Mikono.

98
00:07:27,166 --> 00:07:28,833
Mr. Sora, I realize
this is exciting,

99
00:07:28,916 --> 00:07:30,416
but please calm yourself.

100
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,125
Oww, what was that? Huh?

101
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:40,416
Take a handout everyone.

102
00:07:41,166 --> 00:07:42,916
A walk along the promenade,

103
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,291
group bungee jumping
off of Kowloon tower,

104
00:07:45,375 --> 00:07:48,083
tea at an ocean-side hotel.
What is this?

105
00:07:48,166 --> 00:07:49,416
It's like a date!

106
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,916
More like the coolest date
in the history of dates!

107
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,208
Almost forgot,
you'll need these, too!

108
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:57,750
What the hell are these things?

109
00:07:57,833 --> 00:07:58,458
So lame.

110
00:07:58,541 --> 00:07:59,875
'Scuse me, where's mine?

111
00:07:59,958 --> 00:08:03,208
Oh, the commander's exempted
you from wearing one.

112
00:08:04,833 --> 00:08:06,791
Listen up; here are
your group assignments.

113
00:08:06,875 --> 00:08:09,625
Group A: Cierro, Enji, Yoka.

114
00:08:09,708 --> 00:08:12,666
Group B: Malloy, Aika, Mist.

115
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:14,750
Please give me hotties.
Please give me hotties.

116
00:08:14,833 --> 00:08:18,083
Group C: Andy, Mix, Yunoha.

117
00:08:18,166 --> 00:08:20,500
Yuno--who? Huh?

118
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:23,583
Andy, I do hope
you are satisfied.

119
00:08:23,666 --> 00:08:26,500
Oh, uh, sure!

120
00:08:26,583 --> 00:08:28,916
This freaky frog-cat
is the boom-diggity!

121
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,666
Frog-cat?

122
00:08:31,291 --> 00:08:32,375
Outstanding.

123
00:08:32,458 --> 00:08:34,375
I'm stuck with Mister
Talky McLoudmouth.

124
00:08:38,125 --> 00:08:40,666
Okay, so, she's a bitch...

125
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:45,583
but check those
curves! Chub alert!

126
00:08:50,208 --> 00:08:54,416
Next up, group D: Cadets
Shrade, Cayenne, and Sazanka.

127
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,583
Well, this should be fun.

128
00:08:56,666 --> 00:08:58,791
That depends on your definition.

129
00:08:58,875 --> 00:09:01,791
Come now, don't be
like that. Relax, friend.

130
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:03,458
Lay off with that crap.

131
00:09:03,541 --> 00:09:05,041
Right, of course.

132
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:12,583
Okay, next group:
Amata, Mikono, and Zessica.

133
00:09:13,125 --> 00:09:14,458
Looks like we're group buds.

134
00:09:14,541 --> 00:09:16,500
Uh-huh.

135
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:24,041
From here, each group
will go their separate ways.

136
00:09:24,125 --> 00:09:26,958
But whatever you do,
make absolutely sure

137
00:09:27,041 --> 00:09:29,541
you don't miss the
boat back, understood?

138
00:09:29,625 --> 00:09:30,958
Yes!

139
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,416
Electrocutions are
happening all over the place!

140
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,416
To be young again.

141
00:10:05,208 --> 00:10:06,416
So what are these?

142
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:08,166
They monitor the
cadets' vital signs,

143
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:11,250
heart rate, aura, perspiration;
specs of that nature.

144
00:10:11,333 --> 00:10:12,833
Should they pass
a certain limit,

145
00:10:12,916 --> 00:10:14,666
an electric charge is released.

146
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:16,875
I, for one, don't approve.

147
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:19,958
What purpose does it serve?
I think it's cruel!

148
00:10:20,041 --> 00:10:21,250
No, you're wrong.

149
00:10:21,333 --> 00:10:23,083
I understand why it
might seem that way,

150
00:10:23,166 --> 00:10:25,958
but this is critical to
maximizing elemental power,

151
00:10:26,041 --> 00:10:28,375
while ensuring we
don't repeat the mistake

152
00:10:28,458 --> 00:10:30,416
that led to the
Great Aquarion Disaster.

153
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,708
The Great Aquarion Disaster?

154
00:10:32,791 --> 00:10:35,291
Nine years ago, when
Aquarion was deployed

155
00:10:35,375 --> 00:10:37,833
to counter the first
charge of Abductors.

156
00:10:37,916 --> 00:10:40,916
During combat, it went wild.

157
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,625
DEAVA lost two
Elements in the conflict.

158
00:10:43,708 --> 00:10:46,750
Donar survived, but the
price he paid was high.

159
00:10:46,833 --> 00:10:49,875
It cost him both arms
and the woman he loved.

160
00:10:53,666 --> 00:10:55,583
Lifeless cogs.

161
00:11:37,833 --> 00:11:40,708
Love's melody will
forever be ephemeral.

162
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:50,208
Donar!

163
00:11:52,375 --> 00:11:56,416
No!

164
00:12:01,291 --> 00:12:03,750
Aquarion resonates
with its pilots' emotions,

165
00:12:03,833 --> 00:12:05,458
intensifying their power.

166
00:12:05,541 --> 00:12:08,333
It amplifies the Element's
ability to do battle,

167
00:12:08,416 --> 00:12:10,375
but the depth of power
correlates directly

168
00:12:10,458 --> 00:12:12,416
to the intensity of emotion.

169
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:14,541
Of all the passions,
do you know which one

170
00:12:14,625 --> 00:12:17,625
is the most intensely
felt in human beings?

171
00:12:17,708 --> 00:12:19,958
Go ahead, take a guess.

172
00:12:20,041 --> 00:12:21,666
I'd say hate or jealousy.

173
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:24,916
No. It's love.

174
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,250
It is?

175
00:12:26,333 --> 00:12:28,083
But no matter what they do,

176
00:12:28,166 --> 00:12:30,833
they cannot let their
feelings turn into actual love.

177
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:32,500
If the pilots ever
go down that path,

178
00:12:32,583 --> 00:12:34,250
Aquarion will lose control.

179
00:12:34,333 --> 00:12:37,041
That is the very
definition of disaster.

180
00:12:37,125 --> 00:12:39,208
It happened to Donar.

181
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:42,208
We must do all we can to
ensure it never happens again.

182
00:12:42,291 --> 00:12:44,791
That's why this
training matters.

183
00:12:44,875 --> 00:12:46,750
If we can keep them on
the threshold of love

184
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:48,708
without letting them cross over,

185
00:12:48,791 --> 00:12:51,625
Aquarion's full
repertoire will manifest;

186
00:12:51,708 --> 00:12:55,166
our Elements will be
able to harness its power.

187
00:12:55,833 --> 00:12:57,625
The relationship
between Amata Sora

188
00:12:57,708 --> 00:13:01,958
and Mikono Suzushiro abides in
that dark, if precarious, place.

189
00:13:02,041 --> 00:13:05,125
That's how they were able
to use the forbidden move.

190
00:13:05,208 --> 00:13:07,208
Think of these
as love detectors.

191
00:13:07,291 --> 00:13:10,000
When certain
feelings arise, zap.

192
00:13:10,083 --> 00:13:14,000
The power we hope to harness
lies just short of insanity.

193
00:13:14,083 --> 00:13:16,541
We're teaching them how
to master their hearts.

194
00:13:17,666 --> 00:13:19,750
Exactly, because of
what I've been through,

195
00:13:19,833 --> 00:13:21,458
I'm obligated to
keep my students

196
00:13:21,541 --> 00:13:23,583
from suffering the same fate.

197
00:13:23,666 --> 00:13:25,416
Especially Amata.

198
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:29,416
He reminds me of myself,
when I was much younger.

199
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:31,250
That's why I'm here.

200
00:13:37,125 --> 00:13:41,000
It's so cute! Look Shush,
it's a cat, just like you!

201
00:13:42,291 --> 00:13:46,208
She's so beautiful. Maybe the
prettiest girl I've ever seen.

202
00:13:53,375 --> 00:13:54,125
Amata?

203
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:55,166
What happened?

204
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:57,125
My butt! It hurts.

205
00:13:57,958 --> 00:14:00,791
Don't forget love's
forbidden, Amata.

206
00:14:01,458 --> 00:14:04,166
I can't take my eyes
off that kid for a minute.

207
00:14:21,375 --> 00:14:23,291
Something stinks.

208
00:14:27,458 --> 00:14:28,958
The dude-to-chick
ratio at this pool

209
00:14:29,041 --> 00:14:31,250
is definitely not up to par.

210
00:14:31,333 --> 00:14:32,958
I wonder why they want us here,

211
00:14:33,041 --> 00:14:33,958
and what's with making me wear

212
00:14:34,041 --> 00:14:36,000
this lame-ass swim-suit?

213
00:14:37,875 --> 00:14:41,000
Seriously though. What the
hell's the story with this doll?

214
00:14:41,375 --> 00:14:42,583
Well, here I am.

215
00:14:50,916 --> 00:14:53,750
They're so big. Huh?

216
00:14:56,166 --> 00:14:58,166
Today's training exercise
is also intended

217
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:00,875
to be a simulation
of Element groupings.

218
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:02,375
If giving over to love is

219
00:15:02,458 --> 00:15:03,875
as dangerous as
you believe it to be,

220
00:15:03,958 --> 00:15:05,791
Mix would make
an excellent soldier.

221
00:15:05,875 --> 00:15:08,041
The opposite sex doesn't
seem to affect her.

222
00:15:08,125 --> 00:15:10,458
Wrong. Girls like that
one close themselves off

223
00:15:10,541 --> 00:15:12,041
to all possibilities,

224
00:15:12,125 --> 00:15:15,500
which makes it nearly impossible
to approach the Love Threshold.

225
00:15:15,583 --> 00:15:19,416
I'm curious. Why are Shrade,
Cayenne and Sazanka a team?

226
00:15:20,458 --> 00:15:22,500
They even told us
what to order for lunch

227
00:15:22,583 --> 00:15:25,250
like we're too stupid to
make decisions on our own.

228
00:15:25,333 --> 00:15:28,333
Here you are, folks.
Your watermelon juice.

229
00:15:29,083 --> 00:15:31,666
Umm, is there supposed
to be only one glass?

230
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:33,625
Yes, I'm afraid that's
what was ordered.

231
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:35,916
Drink up you two.

232
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
What?

233
00:15:37,083 --> 00:15:38,500
Come on, this is
part of our training,

234
00:15:38,583 --> 00:15:40,208
not like we have a choice.

235
00:15:41,666 --> 00:15:43,125
You'll have to excuse
my friend here;

236
00:15:43,208 --> 00:15:45,166
he's a touch shy
around the fairer sex.

237
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:47,041
Uh, I see.

238
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:55,958
Two guys sharing!

239
00:15:56,041 --> 00:15:58,333
And not just any two guys,
Shrade and Cayenne.

240
00:15:58,416 --> 00:16:00,166
I'm in heaven!

241
00:16:06,041 --> 00:16:07,166
Shrade's a rock;

242
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:09,000
it seems nothing can
knock him off balance.

243
00:16:09,083 --> 00:16:11,833
It's impressive. Wish I could
say that for Sazanka,

244
00:16:11,916 --> 00:16:13,875
this will be quite
a shock for her.

245
00:16:13,958 --> 00:16:17,041
Miss Chairman, Shrade's
practical combat record is...

246
00:16:17,125 --> 00:16:18,333
Yes, I am aware.

247
00:16:18,416 --> 00:16:20,083
His health concerns
are limiting...

248
00:16:20,166 --> 00:16:23,625
Shrade Elan lives each day
on the cusp of life and death.

249
00:16:23,708 --> 00:16:25,125
Of all the cadets,

250
00:16:25,208 --> 00:16:27,625
his natural state is the closest
to what we're looking for.

251
00:16:27,708 --> 00:16:29,583
How cold.

252
00:16:29,666 --> 00:16:31,916
Although, there is a
grouping we'll need to watch

253
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,833
more than the others:
Amata, Zessica, and Mikono.

254
00:16:35,916 --> 00:16:37,416
But that doesn't make sense.

255
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:40,375
Mikono has yet to even
manifest any Element powers.

256
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:42,208
If the ring does not
take its full shape,

257
00:16:42,291 --> 00:16:46,125
then the donut is nothing
but a useless lump of dough.

258
00:16:46,208 --> 00:16:48,791
Mikono Suzushiro.

259
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:50,666
She is the key to
completing the ring

260
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:52,916
of our metaphorical donut.

261
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,125
Without her, we have only void.

262
00:17:00,291 --> 00:17:01,541
Will you stop that?

263
00:17:01,625 --> 00:17:03,375
Damn. If this kid keeps this up,

264
00:17:03,458 --> 00:17:06,458
there won't be enough
blow darts in the world.

265
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:08,416
Why me?

266
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:10,166
When Amata looks at me,
his heart starts racing.

267
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:14,291
Wow. Gosh, he really is cute.

268
00:17:14,375 --> 00:17:16,875
You sure do look happy, Mikono.

269
00:17:16,958 --> 00:17:19,375
So, what gives? It's 'cause
you like him, right?

270
00:17:19,458 --> 00:17:20,875
No, it's not like that!

271
00:17:20,958 --> 00:17:22,458
You sure about that?

272
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:24,125
You know, he's kinda my type,

273
00:17:24,208 --> 00:17:26,583
so since you're not
interested, I'll have a go.

274
00:17:26,666 --> 00:17:29,125
Let's see here, what's up next?

275
00:17:29,833 --> 00:17:33,208
Amata! Wanna have some fun?

276
00:17:33,291 --> 00:17:34,291
Well?

277
00:17:37,166 --> 00:17:39,166
Cool, I can make him fly, too.

278
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:41,125
How enlightening.

279
00:17:41,875 --> 00:17:44,041
Looks like you'll fly
for anyone, huh?!

280
00:17:44,125 --> 00:17:46,750
Please! It's not
"anyone," it's me!

281
00:17:46,833 --> 00:17:48,625
Nothing to be ashamed of!

282
00:17:50,041 --> 00:17:51,250
Again?!

283
00:17:53,416 --> 00:17:55,625
Is something the matter, Shush?

284
00:18:01,416 --> 00:18:03,041
Whoa! Who is that?!

285
00:18:03,125 --> 00:18:06,458
I have no idea. But he
looks pretty cute to me.

286
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,458
This one's ripe.

287
00:18:21,666 --> 00:18:23,125
Are you feeling well?

288
00:18:23,208 --> 00:18:25,166
We can take a
break if you want to.

289
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:27,750
No, I'm fine.

290
00:18:28,166 --> 00:18:30,833
Still disgruntled over
a harmless little bow?

291
00:18:30,916 --> 00:18:33,833
Stop trying get a rise outta me.

292
00:18:33,916 --> 00:18:35,416
I'm not playing your game.

293
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:36,958
Please, Cayenne.

294
00:18:37,041 --> 00:18:40,166
If anyone's compelled to a
game against his will, it's me.

295
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:44,250
I've my own Abductor.
It's called disease.

296
00:19:00,458 --> 00:19:02,625
We'd like to buy three jumps.

297
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:03,708
Do I have to?!

298
00:19:03,791 --> 00:19:05,666
Of course, it is
part of our training.

299
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:08,541
But, if you're too
chicken you could back out.

300
00:19:08,625 --> 00:19:10,416
Looks like it's just us!

301
00:19:12,291 --> 00:19:14,208
Knock it off!

302
00:19:14,291 --> 00:19:15,625
That is so cool!

303
00:19:15,708 --> 00:19:17,416
I'm not gonna be a third wheel
on someone else's date!

304
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:18,708
See you guys later.

305
00:19:18,791 --> 00:19:21,958
Wait a sec! Mikono!

306
00:19:23,916 --> 00:19:26,041
Mikono, please! Wait up!

307
00:19:26,125 --> 00:19:28,041
Why should I, you big jerk?!

308
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:31,416
You've been flying for
Zessica all day long!

309
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:35,291
I thought I was special,
but I guess I was wrong.

310
00:19:35,375 --> 00:19:37,458
Wait, what did you just say?

311
00:19:37,541 --> 00:19:38,625
Leave me alone!

312
00:19:38,708 --> 00:19:40,708
Mikono, I--

313
00:19:48,791 --> 00:19:50,958
Oh, wow.

314
00:19:52,625 --> 00:19:54,375
Look at that sunset.

315
00:19:54,458 --> 00:19:57,000
Whoa. It's just like--

316
00:19:57,083 --> 00:19:59,166
Like in Skies of Aquaria.

317
00:20:10,666 --> 00:20:12,375
Hey, this song.

318
00:20:26,333 --> 00:20:28,458
S'like I've been here before.

319
00:20:29,333 --> 00:20:33,500
You and I barely know each
other. We've only just met.

320
00:20:33,583 --> 00:20:39,583
But I feel like I've been by
your side for ages. It's weird.

321
00:20:39,666 --> 00:20:42,083
It doesn't feel
weird to me at all.

322
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:46,000
Do you believe in destiny?

323
00:20:46,083 --> 00:20:48,708
I think we were
supposed to meet.

324
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:54,666
Mikono, are you okay?! I'm
sorry, forget I said anything.

325
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:57,333
Just forget the whole
thing! I didn't mean it!

326
00:20:57,416 --> 00:20:59,333
No, please.

327
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,833
I don't want to forget it!

328
00:21:02,916 --> 00:21:04,916
I don't want you to, either.

329
00:21:11,833 --> 00:21:15,625
This is bad. Mikono's love
index is rising dramatically!

330
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:28,500
Oh no!

331
00:21:28,583 --> 00:21:29,625
Stop them, now!
They're over the brink!

332
00:21:29,708 --> 00:21:31,916
Commander Donar!
Can you handle this?!

333
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,416
Damn it! Both of them
are out of range!

334
00:21:36,583 --> 00:21:38,875
Amata!

335
00:21:49,291 --> 00:21:51,791
Stop it! Amata,
Mikono please don't!

336
00:21:51,875 --> 00:21:53,291
You can't!

337
00:21:53,375 --> 00:21:57,250
The scent of forbidden love
is like honey. Even so.

338
00:21:57,333 --> 00:22:01,208
Such sweet aroma is
guaranteed to attract ants.

339
00:22:06,041 --> 00:22:07,458
Hey, sweetheart.

340
00:22:15,958 --> 00:22:17,416
You reek.

341
00:22:21,166 --> 00:22:23,583
You stink like carrion.

342
00:22:27,708 --> 00:22:29,291
No! Mikono!

343
00:22:30,416 --> 00:22:31,958
This is outrageous!

344
00:22:32,041 --> 00:22:35,041
Indeed, even worse...

345
00:22:36,208 --> 00:22:38,791
it bodes an unresolved tone.

346
00:22:45,041 --> 00:22:46,041
Mikono!

347
00:22:46,916 --> 00:22:48,583
Mikono!

348
00:24:23,125 --> 00:24:24,291
Let's talk about
what's happening

349
00:24:24,375 --> 00:24:26,166
in seven days, shall we?

350
00:24:26,250 --> 00:24:28,291
The upcoming
"scherzando battle" will be

351
00:24:28,375 --> 00:24:30,375
the dal segno into darkness.

352
00:24:30,458 --> 00:24:32,166
Isn't that right, my friend?

353
00:24:32,250 --> 00:24:36,083
Next time on Aquarion Evol:
"Agitato of Life."
