1
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:35,625
Get a hold of yourself.

2
00:00:35,708 --> 00:00:37,833
It's only another
stupid nightmare.

3
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:45,375
Another friggin' ill-omened
twinge of phantom pain.

4
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:51,958
But something's up.
I can feel it.

5
00:00:59,708 --> 00:01:00,708
Suomi!

6
00:01:00,791 --> 00:01:02,500
Stay calm; let's focus
on evacuation.

7
00:01:02,583 --> 00:01:04,000
Right.

8
00:01:11,125 --> 00:01:13,125
Come on, come on!

9
00:01:13,708 --> 00:01:16,000
Crap. None of you
got the right stink.

10
00:01:16,083 --> 00:01:18,666
Where the hell is
my Sylvie, dammit?!

11
00:01:28,541 --> 00:01:30,458
Oh, no.

12
00:01:30,541 --> 00:01:32,666
Hang on!

13
00:01:34,875 --> 00:01:36,625
Why, Jin? I trusted you.

14
00:01:36,708 --> 00:01:39,000
Oh gosh, you're one of them.

15
00:01:39,083 --> 00:01:40,958
Why couldn't I just
accept the obvious?

16
00:01:41,041 --> 00:01:42,125
What?

17
00:01:42,208 --> 00:01:44,208
I wasn't trying...

18
00:01:44,291 --> 00:01:48,583
It was just-- It was
just sitting there.

19
00:01:49,916 --> 00:01:52,083
Guys! What are you doing?!

20
00:01:52,166 --> 00:01:53,708
Get to the shelter!

21
00:01:53,791 --> 00:01:55,250
Mix, what the hell?!

22
00:01:55,333 --> 00:01:57,083
What?

23
00:02:02,916 --> 00:02:04,833
Look out!

24
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,625
Yunoha!

25
00:03:41,333 --> 00:03:43,708
The enemy mech is taking
out our auto-cannons!

26
00:03:43,791 --> 00:03:45,291
We're down to 28%!

27
00:03:45,375 --> 00:03:47,250
The commons have been cleared.

28
00:03:47,333 --> 00:03:49,000
Cadets are safe in the shelter.

29
00:03:49,083 --> 00:03:53,000
Except, well, we still have
over twenty unaccounted for.

30
00:03:53,583 --> 00:03:54,791
Dammit!

31
00:03:54,875 --> 00:03:56,041
Launch gate standing by.

32
00:03:56,125 --> 00:03:58,750
Repeat: launch gate standing by.

33
00:03:58,833 --> 00:04:01,125
I know who it is. Has to be.

34
00:04:01,208 --> 00:04:03,750
He...

35
00:04:03,833 --> 00:04:06,666
Mikono, whatever's out there,

36
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:10,541
you and I are in this together.
I will protect you.

37
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:12,750
Oh Amata.

38
00:04:12,833 --> 00:04:17,083
And I'll protect you. Got that?

39
00:04:17,166 --> 00:04:18,541
Yes ma'am.

40
00:04:19,625 --> 00:04:21,083
Okay, either get a room

41
00:04:21,166 --> 00:04:22,916
or get out there
and kick some ass.

42
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,333
Now, let's do this!

43
00:04:25,416 --> 00:04:26,666
Roger!

44
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:31,791
Right. Let's blast
him off the base.

45
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:33,708
Counterattack Merge!

46
00:04:33,791 --> 00:04:34,666
Go!

47
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:36,166
Aquarion!

48
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:44,583
Aquarion Evol!

49
00:04:50,166 --> 00:04:51,583
There's the stench.

50
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:53,583
Couldn't stay away, could ya?

51
00:04:53,666 --> 00:04:59,208
Oh, yeah. Come to me, Sylvie!

52
00:05:04,625 --> 00:05:06,041
How the hell did he do that?!

53
00:05:06,125 --> 00:05:08,500
He's on our comm frequency?!

54
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:11,708
My chest. What is this pain?

55
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:24,333
Infinity Punch!

56
00:05:25,166 --> 00:05:26,458
Hell, no!

57
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:34,583
The Infinity Punch!

58
00:05:34,666 --> 00:05:36,583
He threw it back in their face!

59
00:05:36,666 --> 00:05:38,583
Son of a...

60
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,833
I'm reading abnormally
high aura levels

61
00:05:41,916 --> 00:05:43,625
from the Mithra Gnis!

62
00:05:43,708 --> 00:05:46,583
Wait, are those-- are
those Element sigils?!

63
00:05:46,666 --> 00:05:49,875
Impossible. Surely the Abductor
can't be one of our own.

64
00:05:49,958 --> 00:05:51,750
Damn straight!

65
00:05:51,833 --> 00:05:53,291
The power of reversal.

66
00:05:53,375 --> 00:05:54,625
Excuse me, what?

67
00:05:54,708 --> 00:05:57,291
If hatred is love transformed,

68
00:05:57,375 --> 00:06:00,916
then light is blackest
night upended.

69
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,250
Fire, the twin brother of ice.

70
00:06:03,333 --> 00:06:07,125
Good heavens. He's changing
the laws of physics!

71
00:06:16,958 --> 00:06:18,125
There.

72
00:06:18,208 --> 00:06:20,208
Jin. Where...?

73
00:06:20,541 --> 00:06:21,916
Hey, sleepyhead.

74
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,875
What're you...?

75
00:06:23,958 --> 00:06:25,708
I'm taking you back with me.

76
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:27,458
Huh?

77
00:06:27,541 --> 00:06:32,041
To Altair. Okay?
That's where I come from.

78
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:35,375
Please, you can't!

79
00:06:39,125 --> 00:06:41,625
Jin listen. Up there.

80
00:06:41,708 --> 00:06:43,583
What do you think that sound is?

81
00:06:43,666 --> 00:06:46,541
That's the people who accepted
you fighting for their lives!

82
00:06:46,625 --> 00:06:50,291
So what?! Some of us
have a job to do, okay?!

83
00:06:50,375 --> 00:06:51,500
Jin...

84
00:06:51,583 --> 00:06:52,500
They're fighting for
their lives right now

85
00:06:52,583 --> 00:06:54,458
because I sold
them up the river!

86
00:06:54,541 --> 00:06:55,708
You understand that?

87
00:06:55,791 --> 00:06:57,000
This whole thing was about you--

88
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:59,250
from the first line of
bullshit to the last.

89
00:06:59,333 --> 00:07:01,791
Because Altair needs you.

90
00:07:01,875 --> 00:07:03,750
Stop it! Let go of me!

91
00:07:08,208 --> 00:07:09,166
Security breach!

92
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:10,416
One of the Vectors is attempting

93
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:13,166
to make an unauthorized
launch! Please advise!

94
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:14,166
You're kidding me!

95
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:15,791
Got a visual on the pilot?

96
00:07:18,125 --> 00:07:21,500
Son of a bitch! What did
I say?! He's a damn spy!

97
00:07:21,583 --> 00:07:22,958
Dude, this is crazy.

98
00:07:23,041 --> 00:07:23,958
Oh, wow.

99
00:07:24,041 --> 00:07:25,458
That creep.

100
00:07:25,541 --> 00:07:28,958
Well, I guess we all knew he
was hiding something, right?

101
00:07:29,416 --> 00:07:30,791
Permission to deal with him?

102
00:07:30,875 --> 00:07:33,166
Permission granted.

103
00:07:35,041 --> 00:07:36,333
Zessica, get my back!

104
00:07:36,416 --> 00:07:37,791
Done!

105
00:07:42,125 --> 00:07:43,666
Y'wanna play?!

106
00:07:53,416 --> 00:07:54,750
What is with this guy?!

107
00:07:54,833 --> 00:07:56,833
This is more than
an unlocked skill.

108
00:07:56,916 --> 00:07:58,625
It's like he's
quadrupled in strength

109
00:07:58,708 --> 00:08:02,791
since our last run
in with him. Now what?

110
00:08:03,708 --> 00:08:05,208
Something's coming through!

111
00:08:05,291 --> 00:08:07,166
Those look like
tendrils of energy.

112
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:09,000
Something from the
other side of the gate

113
00:08:09,083 --> 00:08:11,291
is feeding him
concentrated light!

114
00:08:11,375 --> 00:08:12,666
What are we standing
around for, then?

115
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:14,416
Close the damn thing!

116
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,875
I fear the light is
making that impossible.

117
00:08:16,958 --> 00:08:19,041
The red strand of fate.

118
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:22,000
What did you say?

119
00:08:22,083 --> 00:08:23,333
High Commander.

120
00:08:23,416 --> 00:08:24,500
Reveal the skein

121
00:08:24,583 --> 00:08:26,958
from whence this
tangled thread descends.

122
00:08:27,041 --> 00:08:29,208
Show yourself, beast!

123
00:08:32,875 --> 00:08:36,583
Very well. Ask and
ye shall receive.

124
00:08:37,958 --> 00:08:39,708
It can't be.

125
00:08:51,458 --> 00:08:52,916
What is going on?

126
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,208
You bastard!

127
00:09:00,458 --> 00:09:03,708
I thought-- I thought
you liked it here.

128
00:09:03,791 --> 00:09:05,625
That you liked us.

129
00:09:06,541 --> 00:09:09,000
Was that all just
part of the act?

130
00:09:09,083 --> 00:09:10,750
Shut up!

131
00:09:10,833 --> 00:09:13,333
No. No I won't.

132
00:09:13,416 --> 00:09:15,333
We took you in without question,

133
00:09:15,416 --> 00:09:18,416
and not just because
it was our job.

134
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,708
You were one of us!

135
00:09:24,833 --> 00:09:26,625
No.

136
00:09:30,875 --> 00:09:32,458
You're full of shit!

137
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:44,083
Yeah, run while you can.

138
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:46,833
The scion of a
dying breed returns

139
00:09:46,916 --> 00:09:49,333
to his people as
a beacon of hope.

140
00:09:49,416 --> 00:09:50,666
Who are you?!

141
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:52,541
He's beautiful.

142
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,541
You will stop all of
this nonsense, at once!

143
00:10:04,583 --> 00:10:06,083
Oh, no-- what have you done?!

144
00:10:06,166 --> 00:10:07,750
Donar! Wake up!

145
00:10:10,333 --> 00:10:13,041
How the years melt away.

146
00:10:13,125 --> 00:10:15,166
Or perhaps I should say eons?

147
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:19,458
Shall we measure the
time in losses or gains?

148
00:10:19,875 --> 00:10:20,791
What does he mean?

149
00:10:20,875 --> 00:10:24,291
Nice to finally
get a look at you.

150
00:10:24,375 --> 00:10:26,708
I wish I could say the same
for the regrettable veneer

151
00:10:26,791 --> 00:10:29,291
you've chosen to
swathe yourself in.

152
00:10:29,375 --> 00:10:32,708
Why trade your genuine
form for this shambles?

153
00:10:32,791 --> 00:10:34,250
Has it eluded you?

154
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:37,791
A wise man said illusion is
the first of all pleasures.

155
00:10:37,875 --> 00:10:40,791
Yet every sleight of
hand binds us to the past.

156
00:10:40,875 --> 00:10:43,083
A shame your own
form is distilled only

157
00:10:43,166 --> 00:10:47,208
from those vicissitudes
congruent with hate.

158
00:10:48,166 --> 00:10:52,041
Perhaps. But enough philosophy.

159
00:10:52,125 --> 00:10:55,625
The Wings of Apollonius,
their amber radiance.

160
00:10:55,708 --> 00:10:57,791
Where do they lie?

161
00:10:57,875 --> 00:11:00,666
I would know
Solar Wing's touch again.

162
00:11:09,583 --> 00:11:11,375
Oh, no! That's Aquarion!

163
00:11:11,458 --> 00:11:13,333
Jin, please! Let me help them!

164
00:11:13,416 --> 00:11:16,125
You've got to take me back.

165
00:11:19,958 --> 00:11:23,708
Please, Jin.
They're your friends.

166
00:11:29,375 --> 00:11:31,208
I can't.

167
00:11:32,666 --> 00:11:33,958
I'm sorry.

168
00:11:47,375 --> 00:11:50,000
Ah, that's the stuff.

169
00:11:55,041 --> 00:11:56,791
Show me the goods.

170
00:12:06,083 --> 00:12:09,333
Amata, I...

171
00:12:12,708 --> 00:12:17,416
Oh, baby. Oh, baby!
My sweet Sylvie!

172
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:18,500
Silvie?!

173
00:12:18,583 --> 00:12:20,166
You little bitch.

174
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:23,000
I've loathed you
since the moment we met!

175
00:12:24,208 --> 00:12:25,666
My tainted Sylvie!

176
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:26,791
Stop it! Let me go!

177
00:12:26,875 --> 00:12:29,166
Sylvie? Mikono!

178
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:33,708
Of course, first you die!

179
00:12:35,375 --> 00:12:40,416
I'm gonna crush you slowly
like a melon. Forever.

180
00:12:45,958 --> 00:12:47,625
No. No!

181
00:12:47,708 --> 00:12:49,375
Mikono!

182
00:12:52,541 --> 00:12:53,916
Fucker!

183
00:13:02,375 --> 00:13:03,666
I've got you!

184
00:13:04,625 --> 00:13:07,666
So, the lil' guy
without a scent.

185
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:09,541
We gotta stop
meeting like this, boy.

186
00:13:09,625 --> 00:13:11,208
You're gettin'
to be a real pain.

187
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:13,833
You're out of your damn mind.

188
00:13:13,916 --> 00:13:16,041
Rule of thumb in
my neck o' the woods,

189
00:13:16,125 --> 00:13:18,833
you don't smell,
you don't exist.

190
00:13:18,916 --> 00:13:21,791
You're just a phantom limb
that needs to be forgotten.

191
00:13:23,458 --> 00:13:25,458
Thanks for the memories.

192
00:13:26,291 --> 00:13:28,666
Let's get that heart
pumpin' backwards, huh?

193
00:13:31,875 --> 00:13:35,750
Magnificent.
The net is closing on you.

194
00:13:35,833 --> 00:13:39,583
Your own beacon of hope will
be summarily extinguished.

195
00:13:42,833 --> 00:13:45,291
Speak, old friend.

196
00:13:45,375 --> 00:13:48,291
For the sake of a
love that bridges eons.

197
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:53,833
Solar Wing. Where does it lie?

198
00:14:02,083 --> 00:14:03,416
Oh, of course.

199
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,458
How rude of me.

200
00:14:09,458 --> 00:14:11,666
Blame sleep, Donar Dantes.

201
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:14,208
You are anything
but forgettable.

202
00:14:17,875 --> 00:14:19,250
Till we meet again.

203
00:14:26,291 --> 00:14:29,375
That was a tulpa; a
projection of pure thought.

204
00:14:30,458 --> 00:14:34,000
Miss Suomi, Raise the
Element Jammer immediately.

205
00:14:34,083 --> 00:14:35,250
Yes, ma'am.

206
00:14:38,708 --> 00:14:39,500
Please, no.

207
00:14:39,583 --> 00:14:40,791
See ya.

208
00:14:40,875 --> 00:14:41,958
Huh?

209
00:14:44,208 --> 00:14:45,166
Amata!

210
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,500
You guys all right?!

211
00:14:48,583 --> 00:14:50,166
Andy! Mix!

212
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:52,875
What a relief!

213
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:55,291
I thought you
two were pulverized!

214
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:57,500
Couldn'ta planned
it better, right?

215
00:14:57,583 --> 00:14:59,750
Actually I was just diggin'
us to safety and Ass-hat

216
00:14:59,833 --> 00:15:01,916
was in the wrong
place at the right time.

217
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,250
Bastards!

218
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:10,500
You've bought yourselves
a life reversal!

219
00:15:10,583 --> 00:15:12,875
Go on, I dare ya!

220
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,166
Damnit!

221
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:20,333
Hang in there, sis!

222
00:15:20,416 --> 00:15:22,250
Cayenne!

223
00:15:22,333 --> 00:15:24,416
And Shrade!

224
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:27,333
Enough chatter. Re-board
your Vectors and merge!

225
00:15:27,416 --> 00:15:28,875
Roger!

226
00:15:28,958 --> 00:15:31,583
Ma'am, with all due respect the
damn gate's still wide open.

227
00:15:31,666 --> 00:15:33,625
I've got this.

228
00:15:36,416 --> 00:15:38,750
Trust me, I can close it.

229
00:15:38,833 --> 00:15:40,250
Trust you?!

230
00:15:40,333 --> 00:15:42,500
Akbar-jin Bat-bayar.
Young man...

231
00:15:42,583 --> 00:15:48,791
Wait! That's not who
I am. I'm Jin Muso!

232
00:15:48,875 --> 00:15:51,083
Whatever you're
called, you're dead!

233
00:15:51,166 --> 00:15:52,833
You have to believe him!

234
00:15:52,916 --> 00:15:57,833
He's changed. He's accepted
that he's one of us now.

235
00:15:57,916 --> 00:16:00,416
Yunoha, he's using
you! Get a grip!

236
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:03,791
You don't wanna believe me,
Cayenne, that's your right.

237
00:16:03,875 --> 00:16:08,166
But listen, the thing I'm gonna
do, the power to isolate?

238
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:10,375
This place is
what brought it out,

239
00:16:10,458 --> 00:16:13,250
and without it the gate's
not gonna get shut!

240
00:16:13,333 --> 00:16:14,750
But you were...

241
00:16:14,833 --> 00:16:17,000
You need to merge with me.

242
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:21,333
A bridge too far.

243
00:16:21,416 --> 00:16:22,750
Oh, no!

244
00:16:26,708 --> 00:16:30,291
How sweet is
treacherous love. How costly.

245
00:16:30,375 --> 00:16:33,666
Stop it! Leave her alone!

246
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,291
Yunoha!

247
00:16:45,291 --> 00:16:46,625
What's wrong?!

248
00:16:48,458 --> 00:16:50,041
Jin!

249
00:16:51,708 --> 00:16:52,958
No, it's okay.

250
00:16:53,041 --> 00:16:55,625
Everything in his bag
of tricks is an illusion.

251
00:16:55,708 --> 00:16:57,208
You're sure?

252
00:16:58,041 --> 00:17:02,333
Look, there's no time.
We've got to merge!

253
00:17:04,166 --> 00:17:07,041
Alright, fine! Get it over with!

254
00:17:09,666 --> 00:17:11,458
Sonata for four hands!

255
00:17:11,541 --> 00:17:12,291
Go!

256
00:17:12,375 --> 00:17:13,833
Aquarion!

257
00:17:13,916 --> 00:17:15,208
Artillery Merge!

258
00:17:15,291 --> 00:17:16,125
Go!

259
00:17:16,208 --> 00:17:18,041
Aquarion!

260
00:17:33,125 --> 00:17:34,833
This is it.

261
00:17:37,416 --> 00:17:40,916
Magnificent!
A rich, complex timbre!

262
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,708
My blood is on fire!

263
00:17:43,791 --> 00:17:45,625
A boundary is breaking.

264
00:17:45,708 --> 00:17:49,583
This-- This is beautiful.

265
00:17:49,666 --> 00:17:51,458
This is us!

266
00:17:51,541 --> 00:17:54,791
Aquarion Gepard!

267
00:17:54,875 --> 00:17:58,291
Aquarion Spada!

268
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:06,583
Whoa.

269
00:18:07,083 --> 00:18:09,791
Well done, my friend. Brava!

270
00:18:26,416 --> 00:18:28,250
Playtime's over, children!

271
00:18:41,625 --> 00:18:43,250
His tone is jarring.

272
00:18:43,333 --> 00:18:44,916
We'll be shaken to pieces!

273
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:47,041
Yunoha!

274
00:18:47,958 --> 00:18:49,791
Aura levels dropping rapidly!

275
00:18:49,875 --> 00:18:51,625
Vital signs: unstable!

276
00:18:51,708 --> 00:18:53,833
He-- he's killing them!

277
00:18:54,416 --> 00:18:55,833
The hell he is.

278
00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:00,833
Please, don't.
You're hurt too badly.

279
00:19:00,916 --> 00:19:02,166
It's just an illusion!

280
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:05,458
I'm fine! Let me
do what I have to!

281
00:19:08,791 --> 00:19:10,625
I know what's real.

282
00:19:14,416 --> 00:19:16,250
So do I.

283
00:19:24,625 --> 00:19:25,875
What're you...?

284
00:19:25,958 --> 00:19:28,958
We're in this together.

285
00:19:33,875 --> 00:19:35,250
All of us.

286
00:19:35,333 --> 00:19:36,125
Together.

287
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:37,625
Ditto.

288
00:19:38,708 --> 00:19:41,083
Together.

289
00:19:45,041 --> 00:19:46,666
We're all in sync!

290
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:52,625
What?

291
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:57,750
What is that light?

292
00:19:57,833 --> 00:20:00,083
That which connects
separate eternities.

293
00:20:00,166 --> 00:20:02,375
Light which sutures the void.

294
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:11,250
The Gepard form is
spawning a new arsenal!

295
00:20:11,333 --> 00:20:13,416
How is this possible?!

296
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,000
Say hello to evolution!

297
00:20:15,083 --> 00:20:17,333
I think Aquarion likes you.

298
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:19,375
We'll hold him off;
you seal the gate.

299
00:20:19,458 --> 00:20:21,041
Right. Let's do this!

300
00:20:21,125 --> 00:20:22,708
Roger!

301
00:20:42,416 --> 00:20:43,333
Ready.

302
00:20:43,416 --> 00:20:44,666
I hope you know
what you're doing.

303
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:46,500
Shielding our dimension.

304
00:20:46,583 --> 00:20:49,208
Now!

305
00:20:54,625 --> 00:20:56,291
They've formed
an isolation field!

306
00:20:56,375 --> 00:20:57,375
Yes.

307
00:20:57,458 --> 00:20:59,166
Observe the tempo carefully.

308
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:00,750
Right!

309
00:21:00,833 --> 00:21:01,958
Now, from the top.

310
00:21:02,041 --> 00:21:04,708
A clarifying interruzione!

311
00:21:13,666 --> 00:21:15,083
Reversal!

312
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:40,708
Molto risoluto!

313
00:21:42,375 --> 00:21:43,666
No!

314
00:21:54,541 --> 00:21:55,916
Dimension gate is sealed!

315
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,416
Spada and Gepard
are fully intact!

316
00:22:13,958 --> 00:22:15,750
We did it, Jin, we--

317
00:22:19,875 --> 00:22:21,291
Jin?

318
00:22:27,166 --> 00:22:30,666
It's okay. Totally worth it.

319
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:32,833
You were worth it.

320
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,708
Hey, don't cry, at least--

321
00:22:38,791 --> 00:22:42,250
at least you got me out of my
shell. Right?

322
00:24:23,083 --> 00:24:25,750
I want to flit away on
a gentle spring breeze,

323
00:24:25,833 --> 00:24:28,041
be scattered like
a summer dandelion.

324
00:24:28,125 --> 00:24:30,541
Your face waits for me
on the autumn moon,

325
00:24:30,625 --> 00:24:34,333
only to be obscured by
winter's iron-gray clouds.

326
00:24:34,416 --> 00:24:36,666
Without you, the seasons are...
