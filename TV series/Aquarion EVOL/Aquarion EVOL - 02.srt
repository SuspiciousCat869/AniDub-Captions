1
00:01:02,458 --> 00:01:05,916
It's always important to bear in
mind, our ancestors composed

2
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,583
this hymn in full faith that
their age was the last

3
00:01:08,666 --> 00:01:10,791
to see the Aquarias in battle.

4
00:01:10,875 --> 00:01:14,000
Alas, their wisdom could not
prophesy the Abductor scourge.

5
00:01:14,083 --> 00:01:15,833
Nor the reopening of
the Dimension Gates

6
00:01:15,916 --> 00:01:17,250
through which they come.

7
00:01:17,333 --> 00:01:19,208
The enemy has
decimated our cities,

8
00:01:19,291 --> 00:01:21,041
driven our populations
to the brink;

9
00:01:21,125 --> 00:01:23,666
yet all we can infer of them
is that the world from which

10
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:27,041
they descend boasts
technology similar to our own.

11
00:01:28,208 --> 00:01:31,666
Thus has Neo-DEAVA come to
stand as a bulwark against them.

12
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:36,000
Thus stands Aquaria Type F;
a paean to the noble chosen

13
00:01:36,083 --> 00:01:38,291
Daughters of The Way
that helm her,

14
00:01:38,375 --> 00:01:41,041
and Type M a credit to the sons.

15
00:01:42,708 --> 00:01:46,250
Great is our adversary, but if
Heaven's Children close ranks

16
00:01:46,333 --> 00:01:50,125
against the darkness, dawn
will take wing-- Beg pardon?

17
00:01:50,208 --> 00:01:51,375
What?

18
00:01:51,458 --> 00:01:53,166
My dear, you've deployed
no less than four times

19
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:56,500
to face the Abductors from
the cockpit of an Aquaria.

20
00:01:56,583 --> 00:01:59,416
Educate your fellow sisters,
if you would please.

21
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:01,375
What is it like to merge?

22
00:02:03,625 --> 00:02:05,041
Pretty cool, I suppose.

23
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:08,250
No, it's beyond incredible.

24
00:02:08,333 --> 00:02:11,125
That it is. Nothing
stands comparison

25
00:02:11,208 --> 00:02:13,125
with offering one's purity
to a Holy Guardian when--

26
00:02:13,208 --> 00:02:14,416
Still, though.

27
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:17,166
Girls are awesome and all,
but really, merging

28
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:20,291
with boys would be way
more, I dunno... fun.

29
00:02:24,291 --> 00:02:26,000
Purge your mind!

30
00:02:26,083 --> 00:02:30,125
Impure thoughts are the enemy's
most insidious ally, Zessica!

31
00:02:30,208 --> 00:02:34,166
Hmph. Merging with boys.
It isn't possible!

32
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:35,750
But we--

33
00:02:35,833 --> 00:02:37,416
The Guize Stones
keep you out of sync.

34
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,708
Ergo your maidenhood
is unsullied

35
00:02:39,791 --> 00:02:42,083
and our Guardian
remains a sacred cradle.

36
00:02:42,166 --> 00:02:43,916
Precisely!

37
00:02:55,625 --> 00:02:58,250
I don't know but
I've heard tell.

38
00:02:58,333 --> 00:03:00,541
Guys who fart clean
toilets in hell.

39
00:03:00,625 --> 00:03:03,666
Sure sounds bad,
but I've heard worse...

40
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:06,583
Girls gonna make
this Vector my hearse.

41
00:03:08,833 --> 00:03:09,875
What do we do?

42
00:03:09,958 --> 00:03:10,541
Hold back!

43
00:03:10,625 --> 00:03:11,583
How do we do it?

44
00:03:11,666 --> 00:03:12,375
Unionize!

45
00:03:12,458 --> 00:03:13,000
Come on!

46
00:03:13,083 --> 00:03:13,666
I can't hear you!

47
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:14,541
Unionize!

48
00:03:14,625 --> 00:03:15,541
Persuade me!

49
00:03:15,625 --> 00:03:17,083
Unionize!

50
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:18,625
Come on!

51
00:03:18,708 --> 00:03:20,583
This had better not
be all you've got!

52
00:03:20,666 --> 00:03:23,583
Your nuts re-ascend
while you slept?

53
00:03:23,666 --> 00:03:26,541
Maybe shock therapy'll
coax 'em back down!

54
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:44,125
Wow. I can't remember the
last time I saw you miss.

55
00:03:44,208 --> 00:03:45,625
Dude. Shut up.

56
00:03:45,708 --> 00:03:47,375
What, you have another
one of your visions?

57
00:03:47,458 --> 00:03:49,375
Anything serious?

58
00:03:50,041 --> 00:03:51,750
Wedding
gown-slash-funeral dress.

59
00:03:51,833 --> 00:03:53,375
Again?

60
00:03:53,458 --> 00:03:54,583
Cheerleaders, yes.

61
00:03:54,666 --> 00:03:57,333
Big scary cyborg barking
at you, not so much.

62
00:03:57,416 --> 00:03:58,625
When are the
higher-ups gonna get

63
00:03:58,708 --> 00:04:00,666
what a great motivator
chicks would be?

64
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:04,250
The Berlin seriously
needs to come down.

65
00:04:04,333 --> 00:04:06,750
Andy, we're not lettin'
our minds wander

66
00:04:06,833 --> 00:04:09,166
to the other side of
the wall, now are we?

67
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:10,708
Sir! No way, sir!

68
00:04:11,375 --> 00:04:12,375
'fraid we're past the point

69
00:04:12,458 --> 00:04:15,166
where a friendly
taze'll do any good.

70
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:16,958
But, this...

71
00:04:17,041 --> 00:04:20,250
Thanks for the tough love,
Commander Donar, sir!

72
00:04:21,125 --> 00:04:23,500
Seriously, what's the
point of even being here

73
00:04:23,583 --> 00:04:27,125
if the only people I get to
score a merge with are dudes?

74
00:04:27,208 --> 00:04:30,250
Just a few yards away
from the promised land.

75
00:04:30,333 --> 00:04:34,125
So many hotties. So many bricks.

76
00:04:34,958 --> 00:04:40,208
This sucks... royally.
I'm a lover, not a fighter!

77
00:04:42,458 --> 00:04:44,375
Abductors detected
in the Crest Precinct.

78
00:04:44,458 --> 00:04:46,708
All Elements report to
their second-degree

79
00:04:46,791 --> 00:04:48,833
intercept positions
immediately.

80
00:04:48,916 --> 00:04:50,500
They don't waste any time.

81
00:05:12,916 --> 00:05:14,833
Vector X ready for launch!

82
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:18,666
Vector Y ready for launch!

83
00:05:20,333 --> 00:05:22,416
Vector Z ready for launch!

84
00:07:05,583 --> 00:07:08,583
After twelve--thousand
long years, the dull shards

85
00:07:08,666 --> 00:07:12,833
of our souls find
each other once more.

86
00:07:14,375 --> 00:07:16,291
The legend renews.

87
00:07:16,375 --> 00:07:19,916
The first chord of the final
cadence has been struck.

88
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:28,583
Genesis Union! Go! Aquarion!

89
00:07:31,791 --> 00:07:36,041
This is big. That name's not
been uttered aloud in years.

90
00:07:42,458 --> 00:07:46,000
Wait! Stop it!
We're not allowed to merge!

91
00:07:51,541 --> 00:07:53,166
I can't handle this!

92
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:56,000
What is this? What is this?!

93
00:07:57,125 --> 00:08:00,416
Something inside me
is about to break!

94
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,833
This is happening!

95
00:08:09,416 --> 00:08:12,333
Aquarion Evol!

96
00:08:14,458 --> 00:08:16,875
Aquarion Evol?

97
00:08:17,416 --> 00:08:19,958
Now that's what
I'm talkin' about.

98
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:21,708
This is the fight you
wake up every morning

99
00:08:21,791 --> 00:08:24,000
to feel in your blood!

100
00:08:24,541 --> 00:08:27,041
The scent you track
to the edge of time.

101
00:08:32,125 --> 00:08:34,083
Aquarion Evol?!

102
00:08:34,166 --> 00:08:35,916
Who the hell is this kid?

103
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,458
He's using Vector Z as the head.

104
00:08:38,541 --> 00:08:41,416
This form is
completely unknown to us!

105
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:44,041
This-- this is disgusting! Ugh!

106
00:08:44,125 --> 00:08:45,916
It shouldn't even be possible!

107
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,208
The seal has been broken.
These two have shattered it.

108
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:53,375
I don't understand.

109
00:08:53,458 --> 00:08:55,958
What are we doing
inside an Aquaria?

110
00:08:56,041 --> 00:08:57,291
Um...

111
00:08:57,375 --> 00:08:58,666
And what is "Evol?" 

112
00:08:58,750 --> 00:08:59,833
Look, I- I just...

113
00:08:59,916 --> 00:09:00,666
This is weird.

114
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:02,291
Mikono! What are you doing?

115
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:03,958
Cayenne!

116
00:09:04,041 --> 00:09:06,666
Get the hell out
of his friggin' lap!

117
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:10,708
And you, ginger, Neo-DEAVA
doesn't take terrorism lightly.

118
00:09:10,791 --> 00:09:11,833
Wait, terrorism?!

119
00:09:11,916 --> 00:09:14,083
Listen to me.
This isn't how it looks!

120
00:09:14,166 --> 00:09:16,375
Did I ask you how it looked?

121
00:09:25,375 --> 00:09:26,541
Someone wanna explain to me

122
00:09:26,625 --> 00:09:28,458
how a couple civilians
are operating the head?

123
00:09:28,541 --> 00:09:30,833
Guys, c'mon!
Override the merge already!

124
00:09:30,916 --> 00:09:33,250
What do you think we're
trying to do?! Status?

125
00:09:33,333 --> 00:09:34,708
Still not responding.

126
00:09:34,791 --> 00:09:36,333
The commands
are getting through,

127
00:09:36,416 --> 00:09:39,666
it's just ignoring them!

128
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:42,166
I have a good idea
where this is going.

129
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:43,541
Well I don't.

130
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:48,583
Chief Instruct-- I mean,
Commander, what is all this?

131
00:09:48,666 --> 00:09:49,958
I would think
it's rather obvious;

132
00:09:50,041 --> 00:09:52,291
the status quo's just
been chucked out the window.

133
00:09:52,375 --> 00:09:55,833
Male and female
are able to merge.

134
00:09:55,916 --> 00:10:01,166
No! Aquarion's power is far too
dangerous for mortals to wield!

135
00:10:04,916 --> 00:10:07,791
Wakey wakey.
You're not done yet.

136
00:10:08,333 --> 00:10:10,791
Get off your ass and
come at me full bore!

137
00:10:17,375 --> 00:10:21,250
Hang on!
Everything will be okay.

138
00:10:30,166 --> 00:10:31,166
What?

139
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:48,958
What the hell?

140
00:10:49,041 --> 00:10:50,250
Since when has the
owner's manual said anything

141
00:10:50,333 --> 00:10:51,791
about being able to do that?

142
00:10:51,875 --> 00:10:52,875
Whoa, that's intense.

143
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:54,458
How is he doing this?!

144
00:10:54,541 --> 00:10:58,958
Whoever this punk is, his aura
fits Aquarion like a jackboot!

145
00:10:59,041 --> 00:11:00,166
Huh?

146
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:02,041
Hey, kid, how the hell
did you manage that?

147
00:11:02,125 --> 00:11:04,666
I don't have a clue!
It kinda just happened!

148
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:08,708
Oh you're yankin' my chain.,
unless you're a natural...

149
00:11:08,791 --> 00:11:12,791
Zessica, stop encouraging
him! Heads up!

150
00:11:13,708 --> 00:11:15,916
Alright, look, we're stuck
together for the moment,

151
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,916
so we might as well cooperate.

152
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,291
Cooperate? You mean fight.

153
00:11:31,125 --> 00:11:32,791
That's not what
I had in mind, asshole!

154
00:11:32,875 --> 00:11:34,916
I didn't do it on purpose!

155
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:43,458
No! No!!!

156
00:11:43,541 --> 00:11:46,708
This isn't our fight, Amata.
Please we can't do this.

157
00:11:46,791 --> 00:11:49,208
We're not cut out for it;
we shouldn't even be here!

158
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:50,625
Let's just--

159
00:11:50,708 --> 00:11:52,916
Snap out of it! We're in
this together like it or not!

160
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,375
There's got to be a way out!

161
00:11:54,458 --> 00:11:56,666
The best thing for us is
to just stay out of the way!

162
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:58,458
Mikono! Shut up!

163
00:11:58,833 --> 00:12:00,250
Mikono...

164
00:12:05,875 --> 00:12:07,208
Enemy reinforcements!

165
00:12:07,291 --> 00:12:08,625
And they ain't small.

166
00:12:08,708 --> 00:12:10,833
Three large
Abductor Units confirmed!

167
00:12:13,291 --> 00:12:15,166
Nobody called for you.

168
00:12:16,958 --> 00:12:18,333
Apologies, Master Kagura.

169
00:12:18,416 --> 00:12:19,833
Our orders come from Izumo.

170
00:12:19,916 --> 00:12:22,375
We're to escort you back
to Altair immediately.

171
00:12:22,458 --> 00:12:24,833
I can't believe you let
him put you up to this.

172
00:12:24,916 --> 00:12:27,916
With respect, the Rare
Iguras have been located.

173
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,375
This mission serves
no further purpose.

174
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:33,750
You can tell the
old man to get bent!

175
00:12:38,708 --> 00:12:39,625
Come on, come on!

176
00:12:39,708 --> 00:12:40,750
What am I supposed to do?!

177
00:12:40,833 --> 00:12:43,208
Right. Enough of this crap.

178
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:46,625
Welcome to Combat 101.

179
00:12:48,416 --> 00:12:51,333
'kay. First things first.
Unlock the lever.

180
00:12:56,666 --> 00:12:57,750
What?

181
00:13:05,708 --> 00:13:07,000
Whoa!

182
00:13:07,916 --> 00:13:11,833
Zessica's power has fused
with the new formation!

183
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:14,583
Her aura's resonating
with the boy's.

184
00:13:14,666 --> 00:13:16,791
So this is a mixed union.

185
00:13:16,875 --> 00:13:19,041
Commander,
why do I get the feeling

186
00:13:19,125 --> 00:13:21,125
they've only scratched
the surface?

187
00:13:21,208 --> 00:13:23,291
This is magnificent.

188
00:13:27,375 --> 00:13:28,833
Master Kagura! I entreat you!

189
00:13:28,916 --> 00:13:32,916
No one gets between me and
my prey, you understand? No one!

190
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,166
Sir!

191
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:36,166
Sorry, I'm just gonna
borrow this for minute!

192
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:37,541
Stop it! Please!

193
00:13:40,041 --> 00:13:43,083
Wasn't that his backup?
This doesn't look good.

194
00:13:47,166 --> 00:13:47,875
You're kidding me!

195
00:13:47,958 --> 00:13:49,541
What the hell's going on?!

196
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:56,250
Oh, you smell rancid.

197
00:13:56,333 --> 00:14:00,500
Not gonna lie, though.
It really turns me on.

198
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:14,875
This guy's crazy!

199
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:16,625
He ripped an arm off
his own reinforcement!

200
00:14:16,708 --> 00:14:18,333
What's with the way he's moving?

201
00:14:18,416 --> 00:14:20,916
It's like he's a dog!

202
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,250
Please go away.

203
00:14:22,333 --> 00:14:23,666
Mikono...

204
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:27,083
Make him go away!
Please. Please.

205
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:28,458
Will ya lay off the whining?

206
00:14:28,541 --> 00:14:30,583
Only thing it's doin'
is pissin' me off.

207
00:14:30,666 --> 00:14:33,083
This is a battle, Mikono!
Get with the program!

208
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:39,333
That's not fair.
She's never done this before.

209
00:14:39,416 --> 00:14:42,375
She doesn't even know
if she's in good hands.

210
00:14:42,458 --> 00:14:44,125
Buck up!

211
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:55,083
Oh, what is it now?! Really?!

212
00:14:57,333 --> 00:15:01,083
It's the vision I keep having.
No please, not now...

213
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:03,166
What am I looking at?

214
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:05,833
Behold the prophet of despair.

215
00:15:05,916 --> 00:15:10,000
The tragic entanglements of
those around him, he foresees.

216
00:15:10,083 --> 00:15:11,791
That's all fine and good,
but Commander,

217
00:15:11,875 --> 00:15:13,375
how are we able to see it?

218
00:15:13,458 --> 00:15:17,458
"By any other name" Aquarion has
reclaimed its forbidden past.

219
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:19,166
Its powers have awakened.

220
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:22,458
A pale bride swathed
in funeral vestments.

221
00:15:22,541 --> 00:15:26,083
A union between man and
woman, ending in death.

222
00:15:28,625 --> 00:15:29,583
Mikono?

223
00:15:29,666 --> 00:15:31,625
Me? Why is it me?

224
00:15:31,708 --> 00:15:34,458
Show me the groom's face,
damn you! I wanna see!

225
00:15:39,916 --> 00:15:41,708
Who is--?

226
00:15:52,458 --> 00:15:54,000
Master Kagura!

227
00:15:56,333 --> 00:15:58,291
Let's have a look at you, babe.

228
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:04,500
Yeah. You're in there.
My nose never lies.

229
00:16:04,583 --> 00:16:07,291
You belong to me!

230
00:16:11,375 --> 00:16:12,500
Look out!

231
00:16:30,041 --> 00:16:32,958
This is all your fault, jackass!

232
00:16:33,041 --> 00:16:34,875
Way to drag Mikono into this.

233
00:16:34,958 --> 00:16:37,625
Just had to hijack
an Aquaria, didn't ya?

234
00:16:37,708 --> 00:16:40,125
Well now we're all
gonna die 'cause of you!

235
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:41,875
I- I'm sorry, I...

236
00:16:41,958 --> 00:16:47,500
My emotions, when they take
over, I- I fly.

237
00:16:48,791 --> 00:16:51,083
It's been that way
since I was little.

238
00:16:51,166 --> 00:16:53,500
Everyone always hated me for it.

239
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:59,000
I drove them all
away... Even her.

240
00:16:59,916 --> 00:17:01,583
I never asked for this power.

241
00:17:01,666 --> 00:17:03,666
And I sure as hell
never like using it,

242
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:07,291
but, I didn't know
how else to save her.

243
00:17:07,375 --> 00:17:09,666
Damn it.

244
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:14,750
I made things worse.
I'm so sorry.

245
00:17:21,583 --> 00:17:24,333
I never should've tried to
talk to you in the first place.

246
00:17:24,416 --> 00:17:27,000
I should've just
stayed out of the way.

247
00:17:27,833 --> 00:17:29,541
Don't say that.

248
00:17:32,083 --> 00:17:35,458
Come on, you fetid bitch!
Come out and play!

249
00:17:35,916 --> 00:17:37,625
Shields are failing, ma'am!

250
00:17:37,708 --> 00:17:39,625
They're not going
to last much longer!

251
00:17:40,833 --> 00:17:44,416
To inherit a legend
is to become a legend;

252
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:47,000
to assume a form long forgotten.

253
00:17:47,083 --> 00:17:51,333
Amata Sora, the gift is
ready whenever you are.

254
00:17:55,916 --> 00:17:57,833
I'm sorry.

255
00:17:57,916 --> 00:17:59,708
I didn't mean to
suggest you were like me

256
00:17:59,791 --> 00:18:02,916
when I said all I was good
for was staying out of the way.

257
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,208
Please, take a look at yourself.

258
00:18:05,291 --> 00:18:06,625
We only just met
this afternoon,

259
00:18:06,708 --> 00:18:09,625
and you're laying
down your life for me.

260
00:18:09,708 --> 00:18:13,083
See if the shoe were on the
other foot, I'd just cry.

261
00:18:13,166 --> 00:18:15,333
That's not true.

262
00:18:20,875 --> 00:18:23,375
You're a good guy. Thank you.

263
00:18:27,041 --> 00:18:28,541
Thank you.

264
00:18:33,125 --> 00:18:39,541
Her hand is so tiny.
So delicate. So warm.

265
00:18:42,458 --> 00:18:43,583
Mikono!

266
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,416
What?

267
00:19:15,375 --> 00:19:16,666
Oh, my.

268
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:20,041
Look at that bastard go!
They're not... The Aquarias.

269
00:19:20,125 --> 00:19:23,500
They're not built for
that kind of velocity!

270
00:19:23,583 --> 00:19:25,916
If they don't throw the brakes,
they're gonna be in orbit!

271
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,916
It's that kid! His elemental
power is extraordinary!

272
00:19:56,916 --> 00:19:58,833
Awesome.

273
00:19:58,916 --> 00:20:00,250
Is it over?

274
00:20:05,291 --> 00:20:07,291
Think I'm throwin'
in the towel?!

275
00:20:13,041 --> 00:20:14,875
Dimension Gate, two o'clock!

276
00:20:16,416 --> 00:20:19,208
Enough. Put your toys
away and come home.

277
00:20:19,291 --> 00:20:21,000
Screw that! I can still fight!

278
00:20:21,083 --> 00:20:25,000
Can you, now?
Aren't we whimsical.

279
00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:26,875
Damn it, boy.

280
00:20:26,958 --> 00:20:28,875
Swallow your pride
and get out of there.

281
00:20:28,958 --> 00:20:31,125
That's an order.

282
00:20:31,208 --> 00:20:32,666
Fine!

283
00:20:39,708 --> 00:20:40,500
Uh oh!

284
00:20:40,583 --> 00:20:42,791
Amata, no! You gotta wake up!

285
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:05,791
Cayenne.

286
00:21:18,291 --> 00:21:19,666
Amata, no!

287
00:21:20,125 --> 00:21:23,416
Stay away from Mikono.
Y'hear me?

288
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:26,500
Cayenne. Zessica. Drag
those hijackers back to HQ.

289
00:21:26,583 --> 00:21:30,875
Roger on the guy,
but all due respect, sir?

290
00:21:30,958 --> 00:21:32,916
There's no point
bringing the girl.

291
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,500
She's been inside an Aquaria,
if you hadn't noticed.

292
00:21:35,583 --> 00:21:37,041
We're not setting her loose.

293
00:21:37,125 --> 00:21:38,666
Understood.

294
00:21:45,708 --> 00:21:47,416
I don't believe it.

295
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:49,541
After all this time,

296
00:21:49,625 --> 00:21:53,416
I've finally found her,
the one who'll wait.

297
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:12,541
Perhaps the winged mercury
is... No. Unthinkable.

298
00:22:20,458 --> 00:22:23,500
The prodigal son returns.

299
00:22:34,625 --> 00:22:35,416
Jin.

300
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:37,833
Way to bang up my Gnis, you ass.

301
00:22:38,166 --> 00:22:42,083
'Least tell me the
harvest was good.

302
00:22:42,166 --> 00:22:43,625
I'm in love.

303
00:22:43,708 --> 00:22:45,958
Huh?

304
00:22:49,125 --> 00:22:52,000
Heh, I'm 'onna make
her a very happy wench.

305
00:24:23,416 --> 00:24:25,083
It's okay.
Everyone says merging is

306
00:24:25,166 --> 00:24:27,083
one of the scariest
things you'll ever do,

307
00:24:27,166 --> 00:24:28,375
at least at first.

308
00:24:28,458 --> 00:24:30,166
So don't beat yourself up
if takes you a while

309
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:31,791
to get the hang of it.

310
00:24:31,875 --> 00:24:36,000
Next time on Aquarion Evol:
"Love Index Skyrockets!"
