1
00:00:31,625 --> 00:00:36,875
This piano is in perfect tune,
yet the tone is corrupted.

2
00:00:39,333 --> 00:00:41,875
Our latest addition.

3
00:00:44,958 --> 00:00:48,833
I'm Akbarjin Batbayar.
A pleasure.

4
00:00:48,916 --> 00:00:53,250
Akbal-- Akbarjin, rather
scored record-setting marks

5
00:00:53,333 --> 00:00:56,791
on the Meso-Asiatic
curriculum we sponsor overseas.

6
00:00:56,875 --> 00:00:59,791
He is a candidate for the
reserve Vector pilot program,

7
00:00:59,875 --> 00:01:03,000
so I expect you all to
make him feel welcome.

8
00:01:03,083 --> 00:01:07,375
Yeah, well, I hope
he can pull his weight.

9
00:01:09,833 --> 00:01:14,250
W--whoa, actual Rare Iguras.

10
00:01:15,125 --> 00:01:17,958
I betcha he likes to dig,
whaddya think, Red?

11
00:01:18,041 --> 00:01:20,000
Uh... Sure, why not?

12
00:01:20,083 --> 00:01:22,833
He's kinda cute. Maybe.

13
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:25,041
He's a bottom. Must be.

14
00:01:25,125 --> 00:01:28,416
Wait, or, he could
be switch--hitter!

15
00:01:30,625 --> 00:01:32,250
Could you at least
try to control yourself

16
00:01:32,333 --> 00:01:34,083
around the newbie, please?

17
00:01:34,166 --> 00:01:37,458
Hey--hey!
See somethin' you like?

18
00:01:37,541 --> 00:01:38,750
You could do a lot worse.

19
00:01:38,833 --> 00:01:41,958
No, it's not-- it's
not what you think,

20
00:01:42,041 --> 00:01:45,416
I- I was remembering
my first day.

21
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:26,208
Did you train co-ed
back home, or what?

22
00:03:26,291 --> 00:03:29,583
Give 'im a break.
You can find that online.

23
00:03:29,666 --> 00:03:32,041
What kind of music
do you chill out to?

24
00:03:37,416 --> 00:03:40,041
Did we come on too strong?
Or is he a jerk?

25
00:03:48,375 --> 00:03:50,833
How the hell am
I supposed to survive this?

26
00:03:50,916 --> 00:03:53,583
Focus, stay observant and alert.

27
00:03:54,416 --> 00:03:56,541
So, know your way
around the school yet?

28
00:03:56,625 --> 00:03:58,291
We'll give you a tour.

29
00:04:01,666 --> 00:04:04,000
Observant. Alert.

30
00:04:05,916 --> 00:04:07,166
Observant...

31
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:09,541
Uh, nevermind!

32
00:04:15,708 --> 00:04:18,958
I get to show you
around campus. Hop to.

33
00:04:21,708 --> 00:04:23,291
That's what's left
of the Berlin.

34
00:04:23,375 --> 00:04:26,125
Used to be a dividing wall--
guys on one side,

35
00:04:26,208 --> 00:04:27,083
girls on the other,

36
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:28,916
none shall pass kinda thing,

37
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,458
but part of it got
smashed, so now...

38
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:34,791
Hey, I'm not talkin'
to myself here.

39
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:36,125
At least look.

40
00:04:37,333 --> 00:04:40,291
Dude, seriously. You got
bangs like a friggin' girl.

41
00:04:40,375 --> 00:04:41,750
Don't touch me!

42
00:04:45,583 --> 00:04:49,083
'Kay, fine, whatever. Happy now?

43
00:04:56,291 --> 00:04:58,791
This is Neo-DEAVA's
nerve center.

44
00:04:58,875 --> 00:05:01,041
It's where all our
data gets stored,

45
00:05:01,125 --> 00:05:03,500
and where the brass
direct Aquarion from.

46
00:05:04,375 --> 00:05:06,666
What's Aquarion?

47
00:05:15,666 --> 00:05:17,541
Feel encouraged to scrutinize.

48
00:05:17,625 --> 00:05:19,375
Just know you'll
see things as they are

49
00:05:19,458 --> 00:05:22,416
only if your intentions
are sincere.

50
00:05:28,666 --> 00:05:30,875
Yeah, anyway. Aquarion?

51
00:05:30,958 --> 00:05:34,041
Somebody got railroaded
through basic training.

52
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:36,458
It's what the
Aquarias are called now.

53
00:05:36,958 --> 00:05:38,458
The Machine Angels.

54
00:05:38,541 --> 00:05:40,125
That's it right over there.

55
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:46,416
Go easy on him,
tough guy. He's new.

56
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:48,916
I'm not busting his balls, am I?

57
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,291
I might beg to differ.

58
00:05:50,375 --> 00:05:52,125
Piss off.

59
00:05:52,208 --> 00:05:54,333
C'mon, don't get
bent outta shape!

60
00:05:54,416 --> 00:05:57,250
Now's not the time to try
and ruffle my feathers!

61
00:05:57,333 --> 00:05:59,000
I just don't want
you leading him

62
00:05:59,083 --> 00:06:00,250
by the collar like you did me.

63
00:06:00,333 --> 00:06:01,958
You were puttin' moves
on my sister, jackass!

64
00:06:02,041 --> 00:06:04,833
The hell I was!
I mean, not then anyway...

65
00:06:04,916 --> 00:06:08,125
Oh, I get it,
so now she's fair game?

66
00:06:08,208 --> 00:06:13,375
Wait, what? No!
That's not what I meant. Um...

67
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:16,916
Where did he go?

68
00:06:20,708 --> 00:06:27,291
Sweet, so these are
all pieces of the angel.

69
00:06:31,083 --> 00:06:32,958
Not like I can stuff
it under my coat.

70
00:06:33,041 --> 00:06:35,583
We don't need you to
bring back the whole thing,

71
00:06:35,666 --> 00:06:38,333
just one of the component ships.

72
00:06:38,416 --> 00:06:40,375
Still kind of a tall order.

73
00:06:40,458 --> 00:06:42,625
Only risk it if
you see an opening.

74
00:06:42,708 --> 00:06:45,083
Your priority is
still the Rare Iguras;

75
00:06:45,166 --> 00:06:47,875
keep your eyes peeled
for the True Eve.

76
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:51,958
All of Altair is buzzing with
the news of your survival, Jin.

77
00:06:52,041 --> 00:06:55,541
Complete your mission and come
back to us as soon as possible.

78
00:06:55,625 --> 00:06:56,958
Understood?

79
00:06:57,041 --> 00:06:59,416
Yeah, sounds like everybody's
really worried about me.

80
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,000
I'm sorry?

81
00:07:01,083 --> 00:07:02,500
Nothing.

82
00:07:03,333 --> 00:07:04,833
Stay safe.

83
00:07:04,916 --> 00:07:08,708
Infiltrate Neo-DEAVA, but don't
put yourself in the crosshairs.

84
00:07:08,791 --> 00:07:11,583
Whatever you say. Over and out.

85
00:07:14,708 --> 00:07:17,291
It's cool that you're
Alicia's birthplace and all,

86
00:07:17,375 --> 00:07:19,916
but I'm not homesteading.

87
00:07:27,416 --> 00:07:29,916
An unsecured terminal
in the dead of night,

88
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,916
leapfrog a couple firewalls,

89
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,791
find a prospective
transfer student,

90
00:07:35,875 --> 00:07:40,083
make a few tweaks to his
pertinent data, and boom.

91
00:07:40,166 --> 00:07:42,541
What's a little
grand larceny, right?

92
00:07:43,125 --> 00:07:44,791
I can do this.

93
00:07:58,208 --> 00:08:00,125
Damn right, clear a path.

94
00:08:00,208 --> 00:08:03,291
I've got better things
to do than make small talk.

95
00:08:03,375 --> 00:08:05,958
Oh for crying out loud,
did you bury a bone?!

96
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,750
When the spirit moves me, I dig.

97
00:08:08,833 --> 00:08:10,083
It's a calling!

98
00:08:10,166 --> 00:08:12,333
You're not the boss of me.
I don't gotta explain!

99
00:08:12,416 --> 00:08:13,791
Pig.

100
00:08:24,916 --> 00:08:26,750
My arms are stuck!

101
00:08:26,833 --> 00:08:28,250
Sucks to be you.

102
00:08:29,416 --> 00:08:33,083
Uh, okay. What the hell?

103
00:08:34,416 --> 00:08:35,958
Surely I'm not the
only one to have noticed

104
00:08:36,041 --> 00:08:38,541
the crumbling sense of
discipline around here.

105
00:08:38,625 --> 00:08:41,208
Really? You stop me
in the hallway for this?

106
00:08:41,291 --> 00:08:43,958
Don't take that
attitude with me!

107
00:08:44,041 --> 00:08:46,416
Look, they just need
some time to adjust.

108
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,708
The wall bein' down
is new for everyone.

109
00:08:48,791 --> 00:08:50,833
Well, forgive me for thinking
you of all people would be

110
00:08:50,916 --> 00:08:54,958
worried about the cadets giving
in to the siren song of love.

111
00:08:55,041 --> 00:08:57,875
So don't approve any more
merges, and we'll be golden.

112
00:08:57,958 --> 00:08:59,875
We got bigger
fish to fry, sister.

113
00:08:59,958 --> 00:09:01,291
But--!

114
00:09:01,375 --> 00:09:02,708
Calm down.

115
00:09:02,791 --> 00:09:04,291
You're gonna give yourself
crow's feet or somethin'.

116
00:09:04,375 --> 00:09:06,791
Do not walk away from me when
I am trying to have a serious--

117
00:09:09,583 --> 00:09:11,208
Ahhh! Oh dear. Eww!

118
00:09:11,291 --> 00:09:14,708
Note to self: Rare Iguras
are not to be trifled with!

119
00:09:15,958 --> 00:09:17,250
Come on, girls!

120
00:09:17,708 --> 00:09:18,875
I got the next one!

121
00:09:32,458 --> 00:09:34,875
Okay, not what I expected.

122
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:38,916
These girls are about as far
from Silvie as you can get.

123
00:09:39,291 --> 00:09:43,666
Busted!

124
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:46,291
Ugh! Peeping Tom!

125
00:09:46,375 --> 00:09:48,000
Aw, why's it gotta be the noob?

126
00:09:48,083 --> 00:09:50,500
See? I knew something
was off about him.

127
00:09:50,583 --> 00:09:53,125
We got a perv! Lock the doors!

128
00:09:55,208 --> 00:09:57,125
Your story'd better be good.

129
00:09:57,208 --> 00:09:59,083
What story? He was
trying to see us naked!

130
00:09:59,166 --> 00:10:00,791
I say we quarter him!

131
00:10:00,875 --> 00:10:02,708
Um, excuse me...

132
00:10:03,708 --> 00:10:06,875
Don't get mad, I think this
is all a big misunderstanding.

133
00:10:06,958 --> 00:10:12,375
He just got turned around.
I used to all the time.

134
00:10:12,791 --> 00:10:15,166
I even wandered into the
boy's locker room once.

135
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:17,375
Oh, it was awful.

136
00:10:17,458 --> 00:10:19,291
Who is she?

137
00:10:19,375 --> 00:10:21,708
Well damn.

138
00:10:21,791 --> 00:10:24,916
Truth: you stumble in here by
accident or are you a creep?

139
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:31,958
The first one! I swear!
R-really! Cross my heart!

140
00:10:35,833 --> 00:10:37,458
Yo! Sheepdog, or--

141
00:10:37,541 --> 00:10:41,125
Don't help me... Akbar-John?

142
00:10:41,208 --> 00:10:44,833
Sorry.Your name's kinda tough.

143
00:10:44,916 --> 00:10:47,500
Let's shorten it to Jin. Cool?

144
00:10:48,083 --> 00:10:50,875
Andy. Put 'er there, Jin.

145
00:11:00,375 --> 00:11:01,791
Or be a dick!

146
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:07,083
These people.

147
00:11:09,041 --> 00:11:11,625
Hey, sheepdog.
How ya feel about holes?

148
00:11:11,708 --> 00:11:12,666
Sorry?

149
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:14,916
Holes! You know!

150
00:11:18,916 --> 00:11:21,041
Holes? Seriously?

151
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:25,750
Clearly alone-time isn't a
prized commodity in this one.

152
00:11:30,791 --> 00:11:31,916
Oh and then he was all, like,

153
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,458
"you don't even know"
You believe that?

154
00:11:34,541 --> 00:11:35,833
Like I'm not trying to deal

155
00:11:35,916 --> 00:11:38,291
with my own issues over here,
right? What a jerk!

156
00:11:38,375 --> 00:11:39,791
That's exactly what's going on.

157
00:11:39,875 --> 00:11:41,666
He's not happy unless
he can make you feel bad

158
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:43,375
'cause there's
nothing you can do.

159
00:11:43,458 --> 00:11:45,541
I'm telling you, walk away.
He's not worth it.

160
00:11:45,625 --> 00:11:49,166
What the hell? Word salad;
that's all this is.

161
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:52,291
It's like Rare Iguras
only speak in code.

162
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:01,916
Mind if we sit here, or...?

163
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,791
Oh, hi, guys. Sure. Be my guest.

164
00:12:05,875 --> 00:12:07,208
You about to go invisible again?

165
00:12:07,291 --> 00:12:10,208
Nah, I'm fine now. Thank you.

166
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:12,291
What's the matter?

167
00:12:12,375 --> 00:12:14,958
Um, I'm not really
good with apologies,

168
00:12:15,041 --> 00:12:20,083
but I owe you one, so I'm very
sorry for freaking you guys out!

169
00:12:24,666 --> 00:12:26,791
Aw, totally ancient history.

170
00:12:26,875 --> 00:12:28,333
Water under the bridge;

171
00:12:28,416 --> 00:12:30,666
Mikono just let herself get
a little freaked out, you know?

172
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,208
So it's my fault?!

173
00:12:32,291 --> 00:12:35,333
No! I-- forget I said anything.

174
00:12:35,416 --> 00:12:37,791
Oh, well, you have
point, though.

175
00:12:37,875 --> 00:12:39,083
I mean, I did--

176
00:12:39,166 --> 00:12:41,125
You're good together.

177
00:12:42,375 --> 00:12:44,000
Huh, you think so?

178
00:12:44,083 --> 00:12:46,000
That's sweet of you.

179
00:12:47,541 --> 00:12:49,875
Oh... Hey, Jin.

180
00:12:51,541 --> 00:12:52,708
Jin?

181
00:12:52,791 --> 00:12:54,833
Yep, we kept butchering
the poor dude's name,

182
00:12:54,916 --> 00:12:57,541
so Andy came up with
something short and sweet.

183
00:12:57,625 --> 00:13:00,500
I'm gonna go out on
a limb and say he's shy.

184
00:13:00,583 --> 00:13:03,375
I'm worried about him.

185
00:13:03,458 --> 00:13:06,791
Uh, I-- Not like that.

186
00:13:06,875 --> 00:13:09,458
I just know how hard
it is when you're new.

187
00:13:09,541 --> 00:13:10,875
Yeah.

188
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:12,458
Thing is, I didn't know

189
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:15,541
I could vanish till
they transferred me here.

190
00:13:15,625 --> 00:13:19,416
Everyone crowded me;
wanted to ask questions.

191
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:23,208
They meant well, sure,
but it was so overwhelming.

192
00:13:23,291 --> 00:13:26,083
I just didn't know
how to respond, I guess.

193
00:13:28,208 --> 00:13:31,208
Before too long,
I was the wallflower.

194
00:13:31,291 --> 00:13:34,958
I withdrew; people
stopped noticing me.

195
00:13:37,333 --> 00:13:39,041
It made me start thinking.

196
00:13:39,125 --> 00:13:40,875
How cool would it
be if I could really,

197
00:13:40,958 --> 00:13:43,833
just, you know, disappear.

198
00:13:43,916 --> 00:13:45,708
Poof. And sometimes,

199
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:49,625
if you wish hard enough,
well, you know the rest.

200
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,375
Explains a lot.

201
00:13:57,458 --> 00:14:00,458
Nobody's fault
but my own, really.

202
00:14:00,541 --> 00:14:02,708
They reached out to
me in the beginning.

203
00:14:02,791 --> 00:14:05,333
I just didn't reach back.

204
00:14:05,416 --> 00:14:09,333
I'm pretty sure Jin's going
through the same thing.

205
00:14:09,416 --> 00:14:11,666
That's the girl from the
locker room, isn't it?

206
00:14:16,125 --> 00:14:18,875
Not a triumphant
stance, I notice.

207
00:14:21,666 --> 00:14:23,500
Dude, make friends with the sun.

208
00:14:23,583 --> 00:14:25,041
You look like hell.

209
00:14:25,125 --> 00:14:29,208
You're in a unique position
to judge. Bad dream?

210
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:34,208
The wedding dressed
as a funeral again?

211
00:14:34,291 --> 00:14:36,458
That and a one-eyed giant.

212
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:43,875
A Cyclops? New wrinkle.
What do you think it means?

213
00:14:43,958 --> 00:14:46,750
If I knew I wouldn't be sulking.

214
00:14:46,833 --> 00:14:50,375
Anyway, got something you
want to unload on me?

215
00:14:50,458 --> 00:14:52,833
As it happens,
I do--a new sound,

216
00:14:52,916 --> 00:14:55,375
one I'm quite certain
you need to be aware of.

217
00:14:55,458 --> 00:14:57,291
Go on.

218
00:14:57,375 --> 00:14:59,125
It's rather small, stands out

219
00:14:59,208 --> 00:15:02,375
against the cacophony
of this place, though.

220
00:15:02,458 --> 00:15:04,541
I can't be sure, of course,
but I believe it might have

221
00:15:04,625 --> 00:15:06,791
something to do with
our stray Abductor.

222
00:15:06,875 --> 00:15:09,166
Okay, that's weird.

223
00:15:18,666 --> 00:15:20,458
What am I looking at?

224
00:15:23,541 --> 00:15:25,916
Now they make even less sense.

225
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,666
Didn't think that was possible.

226
00:15:35,708 --> 00:15:37,125
Son of a--!

227
00:15:40,541 --> 00:15:42,041
Sorry! My fault!

228
00:15:42,666 --> 00:15:45,750
That belongs to me. Oh, Jin!

229
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,208
Where'd she go?!

230
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,375
Um. Here.

231
00:15:54,458 --> 00:15:56,083
Thank you very much.

232
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,041
I hope I didn't break
your gadget, though.

233
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:02,208
What are you talking about?

234
00:16:02,708 --> 00:16:06,708
It's okay. I-- I don't think
it's wrong to have or anything.

235
00:16:06,791 --> 00:16:08,416
You kinda threw me for a loop,

236
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:11,833
I mean, you know, vanishing
into thin air, which is cool.

237
00:16:11,916 --> 00:16:13,000
Really?

238
00:16:13,083 --> 00:16:15,750
Well, yeah! Gives you privacy.

239
00:16:15,833 --> 00:16:17,833
Huh-- I guess it does.

240
00:16:17,916 --> 00:16:20,000
I'd love to have that power.

241
00:16:20,083 --> 00:16:22,333
It'd get all these
people off my back.

242
00:16:22,416 --> 00:16:25,541
I dunno. It sorta gets old.

243
00:16:25,625 --> 00:16:26,916
Nuh-uh!

244
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,625
No, seriously, it's lonely.

245
00:16:29,708 --> 00:16:31,500
It'd be bliss!

246
00:16:31,583 --> 00:16:33,000
No-- it wouldn't.

247
00:16:33,083 --> 00:16:36,083
Trust me, you'd hate it.

248
00:16:36,166 --> 00:16:37,958
When I think of all the
people who put themselves

249
00:16:38,041 --> 00:16:43,666
out there for me, and the
way I- I just ignored 'em...

250
00:16:50,541 --> 00:16:53,708
Sorry, not your problem.

251
00:16:53,791 --> 00:16:55,916
Well--

252
00:17:05,458 --> 00:17:09,583
A new sound that stands out
against everything else.

253
00:17:09,666 --> 00:17:11,416
A one-eyed giant.

254
00:17:12,958 --> 00:17:17,666
It can't be a coincidence. This
kid's got something to hide.

255
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:26,416
Mix-- Elemental Power:
spatial augmentation.

256
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:30,583
Filling holes, basically.
Huh, interesting.

257
00:17:31,458 --> 00:17:34,208
Index 112; aura pattern Level A.

258
00:17:34,291 --> 00:17:38,083
Yo, Jin-dog! Wanna get
your fingernails dirty?

259
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:40,541
Aw, c'mon man.

260
00:17:40,625 --> 00:17:42,375
You're the reason
these things have locks.

261
00:17:42,458 --> 00:17:45,166
Another stupid hole;
gimme a break.

262
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:48,666
Aw crap. Yunoha Suroor--

263
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:52,208
Elemental Power:
optical fluoroscopy.

264
00:18:05,583 --> 00:18:09,541
I've poured over your data,
Jin. Excellently done.

265
00:18:09,625 --> 00:18:11,041
Thanks.

266
00:18:11,125 --> 00:18:14,458
Thus far, everything seems
consistent with our predictions.

267
00:18:14,541 --> 00:18:17,041
Odds are favorable that
one of these Rare Iguras is

268
00:18:17,125 --> 00:18:18,791
who we're looking for.

269
00:18:18,875 --> 00:18:22,166
Our True Eve may be within
a stone's throw of you.

270
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:23,958
Yeah, good luck
trying to wrangle her.

271
00:18:24,041 --> 00:18:26,666
Take it from me,
boss, they may look all fragile

272
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:29,375
at first blush,
but they got skills.

273
00:18:29,458 --> 00:18:31,791
No joke, their secret
weapon is crazy.

274
00:18:31,875 --> 00:18:35,083
And that would
be what, precisely?

275
00:18:35,166 --> 00:18:37,208
Crying.

276
00:18:37,291 --> 00:18:39,708
What? I'm not following you.

277
00:18:39,791 --> 00:18:41,958
Look, the one that shot me down.

278
00:18:42,041 --> 00:18:45,083
It turns out, she and I...

279
00:18:45,166 --> 00:18:46,625
Has she found you out?

280
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:48,291
No, not exactly.

281
00:18:48,375 --> 00:18:51,208
The more dangerous
they are, the better.

282
00:18:51,291 --> 00:18:52,750
Bring her back with you.

283
00:18:52,833 --> 00:18:54,250
Huh?

284
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:57,500
I suspect our True Eve won't
turn out to be a Rare Igura

285
00:18:57,583 --> 00:19:00,708
who's anything less
than willful, my boy.

286
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,291
No kidding? You're in?

287
00:19:06,375 --> 00:19:09,375
Ha! Had a feelin' you'd
come around eventually!

288
00:19:09,458 --> 00:19:12,208
Fair warning. It's a
little intense with him.

289
00:19:12,291 --> 00:19:14,041
Aw, Red. Don't be jelly.

290
00:19:14,125 --> 00:19:16,000
There's plenty
Andy for everybody.

291
00:19:16,083 --> 00:19:17,708
Ugh! Dude. Please.

292
00:19:17,791 --> 00:19:19,625
Hey, hey! It's okay.

293
00:19:19,708 --> 00:19:21,666
We're all DBs here
now, aren't we?

294
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:23,500
Kinda wasn't in
the mood for this.

295
00:19:33,708 --> 00:19:35,750
Respect. Nice.

296
00:19:37,416 --> 00:19:41,125
Take it in. This is why we
risk it all for the dig, dude.

297
00:19:41,208 --> 00:19:43,458
Our Paradise Found!

298
00:19:43,541 --> 00:19:44,875
What's the hold up, Red?

299
00:19:44,958 --> 00:19:47,458
A gentleman doesn't
keep the ladies waitin'!

300
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:52,583
Drag-ass. Least be
enthusiastic for Jin's--

301
00:19:54,583 --> 00:19:56,250
Wait a minute.

302
00:19:56,333 --> 00:19:57,125
Great.

303
00:19:57,208 --> 00:19:59,708
Jin! You there?

304
00:19:59,791 --> 00:20:00,916
Shh!

305
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,333
Real good way to get
the hole filled, dude.

306
00:20:03,416 --> 00:20:05,458
Keep it on the QT.

307
00:20:05,541 --> 00:20:07,125
Always about the
hole with you, huh?

308
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:15,875
Found you. 'Kay, then.

309
00:20:19,041 --> 00:20:21,958
Just doin' my job. No choice.

310
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:36,500
Jin, what're-- ?

311
00:20:36,583 --> 00:20:39,291
Be cool, I just--
I wanted to, uh--

312
00:20:39,375 --> 00:20:41,625
pick up where we left off.

313
00:20:41,708 --> 00:20:44,000
About being lonely
and stuff, you know?

314
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:52,291
This is too much. What do I do?

315
00:20:52,375 --> 00:20:55,875
I mean, he's-- he's
reaching out, I guess.

316
00:20:55,958 --> 00:20:59,166
That's good, right?
Maybe for both of us?

317
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:03,791
Never mind, then. No, wait!

318
00:21:23,708 --> 00:21:24,500
Did you hear that?

319
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:26,333
That was totally a stun-gun!

320
00:21:27,291 --> 00:21:28,708
One-man panty raid?

321
00:21:28,791 --> 00:21:33,416
This isn't what it looks like.
I just wanna talk to her.

322
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:36,541
My ass! If you think I buy
you as a transfer student

323
00:21:36,625 --> 00:21:38,625
you're out of your damn mind.

324
00:21:38,708 --> 00:21:40,375
Cayenne, wait!

325
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Get off me! I just
have some questions!

326
00:21:44,083 --> 00:21:46,041
Ease off, man.

327
00:21:46,708 --> 00:21:48,166
I don't think so!

328
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:51,041
Stop! He's telling the truth!

329
00:21:54,875 --> 00:21:56,041
Heads up!

330
00:22:03,333 --> 00:22:05,458
Okay, didn't see that comin'.

331
00:22:05,541 --> 00:22:08,583
Son of a bitch. He's an Element.

332
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:14,375
Whoa, was that-- was that me?

333
00:22:30,125 --> 00:22:31,541
The tone is still a bit jarring.

334
00:22:31,625 --> 00:22:36,375
But perhaps it is beginning
to make sense harmonically.

335
00:22:39,208 --> 00:22:43,666
Isolation can be a gift,
and yet, for all our

336
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:47,458
fortress building, life is
guaranteed to find its way in.

337
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,166
What then, dear boy?

338
00:24:22,958 --> 00:24:26,458
So weird. She's like, every
other thought in my head.

339
00:24:26,541 --> 00:24:28,875
The last time I felt this
way was when Alicia came out

340
00:24:28,958 --> 00:24:32,750
for the cameras in big,
poofy bloomers. Except worse!

341
00:24:32,833 --> 00:24:36,000
Next time on Aquarion Evol:
"Call of the Wild."
