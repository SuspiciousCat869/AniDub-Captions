1
00:00:36,416 --> 00:00:38,041
[SHRADE] The ultimate stage...

2
00:00:38,125 --> 00:00:40,041
I hear it calling out to me.

3
00:02:24,708 --> 00:02:26,333
[SHRADE] This new melody...

4
00:02:26,416 --> 00:02:27,541
This new voice...

5
00:02:27,625 --> 00:02:29,958
They'll be perfect for
the final movement!

6
00:02:30,041 --> 00:02:31,708
But I need more...!

7
00:02:31,791 --> 00:02:34,208
Keep playing, Aquarion,
and don't ever stop!

8
00:02:34,916 --> 00:02:35,916
[CAYENNE] This energy...

9
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,250
Where's it coming from...?!

10
00:02:37,333 --> 00:02:39,041
It's so intense!

11
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:40,041
[SAZANKA] Beautiful...

12
00:02:40,125 --> 00:02:41,750
So elegant and delicate...

13
00:02:41,833 --> 00:02:44,000
But forceful and passionate too!

14
00:02:44,083 --> 00:02:46,541
Like its rhythm is
drumming on my heart...!

15
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:49,250
I've never felt this way before!

16
00:02:49,958 --> 00:02:52,500
[SUOMI] Shrade's...
not wearing a suit...

17
00:02:52,583 --> 00:02:54,958
His body's completely exposed.

18
00:02:55,041 --> 00:02:57,375
That's how he's able to
engage his surroundings.

19
00:02:57,458 --> 00:02:58,416
[DONAR] Good point...

20
00:02:58,500 --> 00:02:59,583
But at the same time,

21
00:02:59,666 --> 00:03:01,750
it means his body
is taking more damage.

22
00:03:01,833 --> 00:03:04,458
He's seriously risking
his life out there.

23
00:03:04,541 --> 00:03:06,291
[CREA] Oh, Shrade.

24
00:03:07,666 --> 00:03:09,125
[SHRADE] Let my heart play...

25
00:03:09,208 --> 00:03:11,833
This is its greatest
cadenza yet!

26
00:03:16,083 --> 00:03:18,000
[KAGURA] What
I saw wasn't fiction.

27
00:03:18,083 --> 00:03:21,791
It was real...
You're me... I'm you.

28
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,958
[KAGURA] Makes
perfect sense, really...

29
00:03:25,041 --> 00:03:27,625
Explains why I wasn't
able to smell you.

30
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:30,208
[KAGURA] Our scent
is exactly the same.

31
00:03:30,958 --> 00:03:34,291
[KAGURA] This picture
showed me everything

32
00:03:34,375 --> 00:03:35,625
I needed to know...
Don't you see...?

33
00:03:37,208 --> 00:03:38,458
[KAGURA] In the beginning...

34
00:03:38,541 --> 00:03:39,625
...you and me?

35
00:03:39,708 --> 00:03:41,583
We were one person.

36
00:03:42,333 --> 00:03:44,791
[KAGURA]
'Til that fateful day.

37
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:47,875
[YOUNG AMATA] Hang on!

38
00:03:47,958 --> 00:03:52,958
Wait...! Please!
Tell me where you're going!

39
00:04:11,708 --> 00:04:13,125
[KAGURA] Remember now...?

40
00:04:13,208 --> 00:04:16,583
You just watched as fate
slipped through your fingers.

41
00:04:16,666 --> 00:04:19,791
You've always
been a coward.

42
00:04:23,041 --> 00:04:25,208
[KAGURA] No better
today than you were then.

43
00:04:25,291 --> 00:04:27,500
You can't do anything
when it really counts...!

44
00:04:27,583 --> 00:04:29,291
Yer friggin' pathetic.

45
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,791
[AMATA] I'm pathetic?
What does that make you...?!

46
00:04:31,875 --> 00:04:34,458
You were just as much a
failure at saving Mom as me...!

47
00:04:34,541 --> 00:04:35,958
You were on Altair with her...!

48
00:04:36,041 --> 00:04:38,541
What have you been
doing all this time?!

49
00:04:38,625 --> 00:04:41,375
[KAGURA] I did make
it across dimensions...

50
00:04:41,458 --> 00:04:45,083
True... Mom though,
didn't do so hot.

51
00:04:45,166 --> 00:04:46,416
[KAGURA] I was alone...

52
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,375
But not for long.

53
00:04:48,458 --> 00:04:50,416
[MIKAGE] Welcome,
frightened one...

54
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:52,041
Dark one...

55
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:54,500
A pleasure to make
your acquaintance.

56
00:04:59,458 --> 00:05:02,083
[MIKAGE] Here in this
arbor, for all time...

57
00:05:02,166 --> 00:05:05,208
I christen thee Kagura.

58
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:08,375
[KAGURA] Mikage raised me...

59
00:05:08,458 --> 00:05:10,416
If you can call it that.

60
00:05:13,333 --> 00:05:16,500
[KAGURA] I'm not broken up
about losing Mom anymore...

61
00:05:16,583 --> 00:05:18,458
Never even knew
who the woman was...

62
00:05:18,541 --> 00:05:21,083
Same story with our dad.

63
00:05:21,166 --> 00:05:24,083
[KAGURA] There's only
one thing I care about...

64
00:05:24,166 --> 00:05:27,333
And that's the
scent of my bitch!

65
00:05:27,708 --> 00:05:29,958
[KAGURA] The real Silvie!

66
00:05:30,958 --> 00:05:34,375
[AMATA] Damn you,
I am not a coward!

67
00:05:34,458 --> 00:05:36,458
And there's no way I'll
let you have Mikono...!

68
00:05:36,541 --> 00:05:38,083
You hear me?!

69
00:05:42,875 --> 00:05:45,125
[KAGURA] You've
always been pathetic.

70
00:05:45,583 --> 00:05:47,208
[KAGURA] You'll never
be good enough!

71
00:05:47,625 --> 00:05:49,000
[MIKONO] No, stop!

72
00:05:49,083 --> 00:05:50,833
Why are you two fighting?

73
00:05:50,916 --> 00:05:54,041
I mean it... Stop...! Right now!

74
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,791
[FUDO] The moment's come at
last...

75
00:05:57,875 --> 00:05:59,500
Solar Wing has awoken.

76
00:05:59,583 --> 00:06:00,625
[MIKONO] Huh?

77
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:29,500
[choral music]

78
00:06:30,375 --> 00:06:31,833
[AMATA] Aaaauugh!!

79
00:06:35,875 --> 00:06:37,333
[KAGURA] What's the
matter, Amata...?

80
00:06:37,416 --> 00:06:40,416
You say you're not a coward,
so why don'tcha man up?!

81
00:06:41,875 --> 00:06:47,541
[loud rumbling]

82
00:06:47,625 --> 00:06:48,916
[KAGURA] The hell?

83
00:06:57,416 --> 00:06:58,416
[AMATA] Mikono!

84
00:06:58,500 --> 00:06:59,750
[KAGURA] Silvie!

85
00:07:04,083 --> 00:07:05,541
[CAYENNE] Mikono?!

86
00:07:15,458 --> 00:07:17,083
[CAYENNE] That was Aquarion.

87
00:07:22,666 --> 00:07:24,708
[SUOMI] We need a
status update, now!

88
00:07:24,791 --> 00:07:26,458
[YUNOHA] Detecting high
quantum emissions...

89
00:07:26,541 --> 00:07:29,333
They're coming from somewhere
near the former lake area!

90
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:42,750
[loud coral music]

91
00:07:42,833 --> 00:07:43,875
[beeping alarms]

92
00:07:43,958 --> 00:07:45,458
[SAZANKA] What the
heck do those mean?

93
00:07:45,541 --> 00:07:48,291
[CAYENNE] It looks like Aquarion
is resonating with that thing.

94
00:07:48,375 --> 00:07:50,000
[SHRADE] It's an
ancient melody...

95
00:07:50,083 --> 00:07:51,250
One that's being heard

96
00:07:51,333 --> 00:07:53,666
for the first time in
twelve thousand years.

97
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:55,083
[DONAR] What the--?

98
00:07:55,166 --> 00:07:56,666
[CREA] There's no
other possibility...

99
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:58,250
It has to be true.

100
00:07:58,333 --> 00:08:02,333
From the myths of old, this
is the Legendary Aquarion!

101
00:08:12,833 --> 00:08:14,208
[MIKAGE] Solar Wing...

102
00:08:14,291 --> 00:08:17,958
At long last, you
finally show yourself.

103
00:08:27,416 --> 00:08:28,750
[MIKONO] Where am I?

104
00:08:30,833 --> 00:08:32,000
[MIKONO] Aquarion?

105
00:08:32,833 --> 00:08:35,041
[MIKONO] But it's...
different...

106
00:08:35,125 --> 00:08:38,208
[AMATA] Mikono! Mikono!

107
00:08:38,291 --> 00:08:39,708
[MIKONO] Amata, hey...

108
00:08:39,791 --> 00:08:41,625
[KAGURA] Silvie!

109
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:45,166
[KAGURA] I've yearned
for you for so long...

110
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:48,041
For twelve thousand years,
I've been waiting...!

111
00:08:48,125 --> 00:08:50,791
But you're here now
and I can finally kill you!

112
00:08:50,875 --> 00:08:52,958
[AMATA] Wait, kill her,
that's what you want?!

113
00:08:53,041 --> 00:08:55,416
[KAGURA] You bet your
ass that's what I want!

114
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:58,750
With every fiber of my
being I want her dead...!

115
00:08:58,833 --> 00:09:01,750
Over and over and over again!

116
00:09:03,083 --> 00:09:05,291
[KAGURA] But
first thing's first...

117
00:09:05,375 --> 00:09:09,375
Amata... I'm gonna
tear you to shreds!

118
00:09:09,458 --> 00:09:10,750
[KAGURA] Don't worry, Silvie...

119
00:09:10,833 --> 00:09:12,250
I'll take care of
this waste o' space...

120
00:09:12,333 --> 00:09:14,958
then we can kill each
other all night long!

121
00:09:15,041 --> 00:09:16,416
[MIKONO] Wait... What?

122
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:17,625
[AMATA] I'm not
gonna let you lay

123
00:09:17,708 --> 00:09:19,625
one damn finger on her!

124
00:09:33,625 --> 00:09:35,083
[CIERRO] Higher-dimensional
quantum emissions

125
00:09:35,166 --> 00:09:36,333
are still rising, sir!

126
00:09:36,416 --> 00:09:38,833
[DONAR] Guess that settles it...

127
00:09:38,916 --> 00:09:41,333
It's the real deal for sure!

128
00:09:41,416 --> 00:09:43,625
[YUNOHA] Aquarion...?
The first one?

129
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:46,333
[MALLOY] All of the old
stories are coming to life.

130
00:09:46,416 --> 00:09:47,416
[ANDY] Yeah right...?

131
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:48,875
History's going down right now

132
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:50,750
and we're here to
see it in person.

133
00:09:50,833 --> 00:09:51,833
[DONAR] You're right...

134
00:09:51,916 --> 00:09:53,750
This is a momentous occasion.

135
00:09:53,833 --> 00:09:57,166
So why's the kid messing
around out there?

136
00:09:57,250 --> 00:10:00,208
[FUDO] That's history too,
and a legend in itself.

137
00:10:00,291 --> 00:10:01,958
[SUOMI] High Commander Fudo...!

138
00:10:02,041 --> 00:10:03,666
When did you get back?!

139
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:06,541
[FUDO] Their lovers' spat...

140
00:10:06,625 --> 00:10:09,083
Is not your concern!

141
00:10:14,875 --> 00:10:16,416
[MIKONO] Amata!

142
00:10:24,875 --> 00:10:27,125
[AMATA] No...!
I won't let you take her!

143
00:10:27,208 --> 00:10:28,833
[KAGURA] Just give up...

144
00:10:28,916 --> 00:10:30,208
This is something
that's been destined

145
00:10:30,291 --> 00:10:32,666
to happen for twelve
thousand years...

146
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:36,333
You and Silvie were
simply never meant to be.

147
00:10:36,416 --> 00:10:37,583
You can't stop fate...

148
00:10:37,666 --> 00:10:39,666
No matter how
much you fight it...

149
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:40,875
Take us.

150
00:10:40,958 --> 00:10:42,958
Against all reason,
fate brought you and I

151
00:10:43,041 --> 00:10:45,750
together from
across the multiverse.

152
00:10:45,833 --> 00:10:47,208
[AMATA] You're wrong...

153
00:10:47,291 --> 00:10:49,666
With my wings,
I can overcome anything!

154
00:10:52,625 --> 00:10:53,791
[KAGURA] What good
are your wings gonna do

155
00:10:53,875 --> 00:10:55,708
if you can't fly...?

156
00:10:55,791 --> 00:10:58,875
Go on... Fly away if you can!

157
00:11:01,416 --> 00:11:02,666
[MIKONO] Stop this...!

158
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:05,791
Whatever you do, just
don't hurt Amata anymore!

159
00:11:05,875 --> 00:11:08,166
[KAGURA] I hate that
smile of yours, Silvie...

160
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:10,500
Makes me wanna
kill you even more...!

161
00:11:10,583 --> 00:11:13,458
Come on... Keep smiling...

162
00:11:13,541 --> 00:11:16,750
Do it...! Smile!

163
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:33,625
[ZESSICA] Where am I?

164
00:11:34,875 --> 00:11:37,541
[ZESSICA] What is
this place...? Am I dead?

165
00:11:39,583 --> 00:11:41,000
[ZESSICA] Amata!

166
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:42,291
[AMATA] Zessica...!

167
00:11:42,375 --> 00:11:44,125
You sure are a
sight for sore eyes!

168
00:11:44,208 --> 00:11:45,458
[ZESSICA] I feel the same...!

169
00:11:45,541 --> 00:11:47,500
But... Why are you here...?

170
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:49,625
Did you come back 'cause
you were worried about me?

171
00:11:52,166 --> 00:11:53,791
[AMATA] Yeah, I get it...!

172
00:11:53,875 --> 00:11:55,791
I finally understand...

173
00:11:55,875 --> 00:11:58,291
I realize now what's
precious to me.

174
00:11:59,291 --> 00:12:00,916
[ZESSICA] Amata.

175
00:12:02,541 --> 00:12:05,041
[AMATA] Come now...
Time to wake up.

176
00:12:07,458 --> 00:12:09,875
[AMATA] I can't
let you die on me...

177
00:12:09,958 --> 00:12:11,750
Not yet anyway-

178
00:12:13,375 --> 00:12:14,958
[MIKAGE] The time
draws nigh for you

179
00:12:15,041 --> 00:12:16,750
to deliver on your promise...

180
00:12:16,833 --> 00:12:18,500
Whether you wish it or not.

181
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,750
[ZESSICA] No!

182
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:32,750
[MIKAGE] I forbid you to die...

183
00:12:32,833 --> 00:12:35,375
You swore a vow,
and freedom shant be yours

184
00:12:35,458 --> 00:12:38,250
'til you uphold your
end of the bargain.

185
00:12:41,875 --> 00:12:42,958
[ZESSICA] What bargain?

186
00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:49,583
[MIKONO] Please, will you
both just cut it out?!

187
00:12:49,666 --> 00:12:50,833
[MIKONO] Why are you doing this?

188
00:12:50,916 --> 00:12:53,125
The last thing I want
is for you two to fight!

189
00:12:53,208 --> 00:12:54,791
[AMATA] Sorry,
but I won't stop...

190
00:12:54,875 --> 00:12:57,291
I'm gonna put an end
to this thing right now!

191
00:12:57,375 --> 00:12:58,166
[KAGURA] Oh yeah...?

192
00:12:58,250 --> 00:12:59,958
And how are you gonna do that?

193
00:13:00,041 --> 00:13:01,916
[AMATA] You want
Mikono for yourself

194
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,125
because you believe
you're destined

195
00:13:03,208 --> 00:13:05,333
for each other, am I right?

196
00:13:05,416 --> 00:13:08,375
[KAGURA] Well... look
who's starting to catch on.

197
00:13:08,458 --> 00:13:11,208
[AMATA] Destiny... is crap!

198
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:14,958
I don't care if Mikono is
the reincarnation of Silvie!

199
00:13:15,041 --> 00:13:16,250
I don't care what
anyone thinks about

200
00:13:16,333 --> 00:13:18,500
what happened 12,000 years ago!

201
00:13:18,583 --> 00:13:23,083
I don't... at all...
All I know is I love her!

202
00:13:23,166 --> 00:13:24,750
[MIKONO] Amata.

203
00:13:24,833 --> 00:13:26,083
[ZESSICA] Amata?

204
00:13:26,166 --> 00:13:26,916
[AMATA] That's right...

205
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
You heard me...

206
00:13:28,083 --> 00:13:32,791
I love her... I love Mikono!

207
00:13:33,375 --> 00:13:35,708
[KAGURA] Then let's find out
which one of us is stronger...

208
00:13:35,791 --> 00:13:37,125
Me with destiny on my side

209
00:13:37,208 --> 00:13:39,250
or you with your
burning emotions...

210
00:13:39,333 --> 00:13:41,583
Only one of us is gonna survive!

211
00:13:51,583 --> 00:13:53,250
[MIKONO] Amata, no!

212
00:13:59,125 --> 00:14:00,750
[KAGURA] What the hell's this?

213
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:03,125
[KAGURA] Solar Wing!

214
00:14:10,041 --> 00:14:11,833
[AMATA] You will not beat me!

215
00:14:11,916 --> 00:14:13,750
No way in hell!

216
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:20,208
[SHRADE] I'm getting so close...

217
00:14:20,291 --> 00:14:21,791
I hear the melody
I've been searching

218
00:14:21,875 --> 00:14:24,000
for my whole lif--!

219
00:14:26,583 --> 00:14:27,250
[CAYENNE] Oh shit!

220
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:28,166
[SAZANKA] Shrade!

221
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:28,958
[CAYENNE] Shrade...!

222
00:14:29,041 --> 00:14:31,250
Talk to us... C'mon, man!

223
00:14:32,083 --> 00:14:33,750
[SHRADE] That unearthly music...

224
00:14:33,833 --> 00:14:36,916
It's... the sweetest
sound I've ever heard!

225
00:14:48,833 --> 00:14:49,833
[KAGURA] Oh crap, Silvie!

226
00:14:49,916 --> 00:14:51,041
[AMATA] Mikono!

227
00:14:56,666 --> 00:14:57,958
[CIERRO] Shrade's vital
levels are dropping fast!

228
00:14:58,041 --> 00:15:00,375
If he keeps fighting
he's not gonna make it,

229
00:15:00,458 --> 00:15:01,833
we gotta stop this!

230
00:15:01,916 --> 00:15:03,416
[DONAR] Emergency
Element change...!

231
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:05,375
Now! Yunoha, you're going in!

232
00:15:05,458 --> 00:15:07,583
[SHRADE] Wait a second.

233
00:15:07,666 --> 00:15:10,250
[SHRADE] Don't take
me out, I can do this...

234
00:15:10,333 --> 00:15:12,291
Just a little bit longer!

235
00:15:12,375 --> 00:15:14,916
I'm almost there... Almost...

236
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,458
[CREA] Element Change, hurry...!

237
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:17,916
Right now!

238
00:15:20,583 --> 00:15:21,666
[YUNOHA] Yunoha Suroor...

239
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:23,208
Ready for combat!

240
00:15:32,291 --> 00:15:33,541
[KAGURA] Not so fast!

241
00:15:39,083 --> 00:15:40,416
[EI] The Aquarion's
higher-dimensional

242
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:41,458
quantum emissions

243
00:15:41,541 --> 00:15:43,208
are beyond our
ability to measure!

244
00:15:43,291 --> 00:15:44,125
[CREA] Zen...

245
00:15:44,208 --> 00:15:45,250
I certainly hope you're planning

246
00:15:45,333 --> 00:15:46,916
to tell me what your goal is...

247
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,333
Everything that's
happening here:

248
00:15:48,416 --> 00:15:51,291
was it all foretold
in the Book of Genesis?

249
00:15:51,375 --> 00:15:52,958
[FUDO] True legends
can only be created

250
00:15:53,041 --> 00:15:55,375
by great and noble people.

251
00:15:55,458 --> 00:15:57,666
Spilled blood is
the ink with which

252
00:15:57,750 --> 00:16:00,750
they're written down
for posterity's eyes.

253
00:16:00,833 --> 00:16:03,750
[CREA] So you're saying
you won't stop them?

254
00:16:03,833 --> 00:16:06,750
[FUDO] There is no difference
between moving and stopping.

255
00:16:09,291 --> 00:16:11,041
[FUDO] When you clap
your hands together

256
00:16:11,125 --> 00:16:13,583
what remains between
them is nothingness.

257
00:16:13,666 --> 00:16:17,625
A vacuous, empty space. Nil.

258
00:16:17,708 --> 00:16:19,083
[FUDO] But sometimes...

259
00:16:19,166 --> 00:16:21,500
Nothingness is deceptive...

260
00:16:21,583 --> 00:16:25,041
For example, the sum zero
is obtained by adding

261
00:16:25,125 --> 00:16:28,541
a positive and a negative of
equal value together...

262
00:16:28,625 --> 00:16:33,583
Such is Mikono Suzushiro's
power of connection...

263
00:16:33,666 --> 00:16:34,958
[MIKAGE] Dark and light...

264
00:16:35,041 --> 00:16:38,166
Holy and unholy...
Good and evil...

265
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:40,750
Positive and negative.

266
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:41,958
[MIKAGE] Let the memories

267
00:16:42,041 --> 00:16:43,791
that were once locked
away, be released...

268
00:16:43,875 --> 00:16:45,458
And the infinite power of zero

269
00:16:45,541 --> 00:16:48,833
be sprung upon
reality once and for all.

270
00:16:48,916 --> 00:16:50,166
[FUDO] At this moment...

271
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:53,666
a brand new history blooms
before our very eyes!

272
00:17:28,041 --> 00:17:29,208
[CAYENNE] Holy--

273
00:17:34,791 --> 00:17:37,000
[YUNOHA] What's happening?!

274
00:17:43,458 --> 00:17:45,416
[MIKAGE] Come to me, my love!

275
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:49,000
Come to me, Solar Wing!

276
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,125
[AMATA] The Legendary
Aquarion, no!

277
00:18:00,875 --> 00:18:02,250
[MIKONO] Amata!

278
00:18:02,333 --> 00:18:03,958
[KAGURA]
That's our cue, bitch...

279
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:05,625
Gate's wide open.

280
00:18:20,541 --> 00:18:21,666
[CIERRO] Commander...!

281
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:23,125
Both Abductors--and the
Legendary Aquarion--

282
00:18:23,208 --> 00:18:25,583
have entered the
dimensional warp gate!

283
00:18:28,875 --> 00:18:30,041
[SHRADE] Please...

284
00:18:30,125 --> 00:18:33,291
I am begging you...
One more time...

285
00:18:33,375 --> 00:18:36,041
You've got to
let me back out there.

286
00:18:36,125 --> 00:18:38,833
[CREA] Sorry, but no...

287
00:18:38,916 --> 00:18:41,583
You will die if I allow that.

288
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:46,666
[SHRADE] You must have known

289
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:49,166
since you brought
me to Neo-DEAVA...

290
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:52,750
You must have sensed it
from the very beginning.

291
00:18:52,833 --> 00:18:55,541
You knew it would
end this way for me.

292
00:19:13,458 --> 00:19:15,500
[CREA] Just promise
me one thing...

293
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:17,541
When you complete your song...

294
00:19:17,625 --> 00:19:20,541
You must swear that
you'll let me hear it.

295
00:19:28,958 --> 00:19:30,625
[AMATA] I'm coming, Mikono!

296
00:19:34,166 --> 00:19:35,583
[AMATA] Shrade?!

297
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:39,583
[EI] Both vectors have
entered the dimension gate...

298
00:19:39,666 --> 00:19:41,333
We've lost contact!

299
00:19:48,291 --> 00:19:49,666
[AMATA] I don't see
either one of 'em!

300
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:51,125
[SHRADE] Amata!

301
00:19:56,541 --> 00:19:59,333
[SHRADE] In order to finish
composing the final song...

302
00:19:59,416 --> 00:20:02,625
I've got to take back
the Legendary Aquarion!

303
00:20:02,708 --> 00:20:04,166
[AMATA] We can't
take him on alone!

304
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:06,500
[ZESSICA] Trust me,
Amata, you're not alone!

305
00:20:06,583 --> 00:20:08,000
[AMATA] Zessica...!

306
00:20:08,083 --> 00:20:09,291
You're alive!

307
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:11,208
[ZESSICA] This is it...

308
00:20:11,291 --> 00:20:14,041
This is how I can
show my love for him!

309
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:18,125
[SHRADE] Destiny Merge...
Gooo... Aquarion!

310
00:20:28,041 --> 00:20:29,083
[ZESSICA] Amata!

311
00:20:29,166 --> 00:20:31,375
[AMATA] Thank you... Zessica.

312
00:20:31,458 --> 00:20:34,250
[SHRADE] My soul is vibrating!

313
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,208
[SHRADE] Aquarion... Spada!

314
00:20:46,166 --> 00:20:47,500
[AMATA] Where did it go?

315
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:53,916
[SHRADE] I have you now.

316
00:20:57,458 --> 00:20:58,791
[AMATA] Oh, man.

317
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,916
[SHRADE] Now: Time
to repent your sins...

318
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,625
Crucifixion Sword!

319
00:21:24,208 --> 00:21:25,458
[ZESSICA] Oh, no!

320
00:21:31,416 --> 00:21:32,583
[TECH A] Gate is opening!

321
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:35,041
The Mithra Gnis is
now coming through...!

322
00:21:35,125 --> 00:21:38,250
Sensors show a
Rare Igura on board!

323
00:21:38,708 --> 00:21:41,750
[IZUMO] The Rare Igura Kagura's
been after all this time...

324
00:21:41,833 --> 00:21:45,583
Is she the True Eve
we've been searching for?

325
00:21:47,166 --> 00:21:49,625
[IZUMO] Prepare for attack!

326
00:21:49,708 --> 00:21:51,541
[IZUMO] If she is
in fact the one,

327
00:21:51,625 --> 00:21:54,833
we can't let Kagura in
his madness destroy her!

328
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:00,916
[CIERRO] We're getting
reports of abnormal weather

329
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,583
and tectonic movement
all over the world!

330
00:22:03,666 --> 00:22:04,791
[FUDO] As foretold, the seal

331
00:22:04,875 --> 00:22:07,583
on the Legendary Aquarion
has been lifted.

332
00:22:07,666 --> 00:22:09,208
The tenuous balance
it maintained

333
00:22:09,291 --> 00:22:12,625
between Altair and Vega
has now shifted irrevocably.

334
00:22:12,708 --> 00:22:15,000
[DONAR] We've lost contact
with the Elements, Commander...

335
00:22:15,083 --> 00:22:17,583
The Legendary Aquarion has
slipped through our fingers...!

336
00:22:17,666 --> 00:22:20,375
Damn! There's nothing
more we can do!

337
00:22:20,458 --> 00:22:21,625
We're helpless here!

338
00:22:21,708 --> 00:22:22,708
[SUOMI] What's going to happen

339
00:22:22,791 --> 00:22:24,166
to the rest of
the world, Commander?

340
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:26,791
[FUDO] Never forget,
there is always hope.

341
00:22:26,875 --> 00:22:29,041
This is no exception...

342
00:22:29,125 --> 00:22:30,875
The Wings of the Sun
will never move

343
00:22:30,958 --> 00:22:33,375
in the absence of
its chosen Element.

344
00:22:37,833 --> 00:22:39,916
[MIKAGE] The moment
is finally upon us.

345
00:22:43,125 --> 00:22:46,166
[MIKAGE] It's time to fulfill
the promise you made to me...

346
00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:49,541
Your precious
covenant has come due.

347
00:24:22,791 --> 00:24:23,625
[MIKAGE] Shall I regale you

348
00:24:23,708 --> 00:24:25,416
with what moves my fancy...?

349
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:27,208
Orchid petals
scattered underfoot

350
00:24:27,291 --> 00:24:29,500
and Kagura's baleful screams...

351
00:24:29,583 --> 00:24:31,500
Shall I tell you
what I despise...?

352
00:24:31,583 --> 00:24:34,500
Betrayals... And the liars
who perpetrate them...

353
00:24:34,583 --> 00:24:37,000
And of course, him.
