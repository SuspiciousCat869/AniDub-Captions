1
00:00:27,208 --> 00:00:28,916
I don't believe it...

2
00:00:33,875 --> 00:00:37,375
What... What're you doing here?

3
00:00:39,791 --> 00:00:41,166
Mother...!

4
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:43,875
Why do you still look
exactly the same?!

5
00:00:48,541 --> 00:00:51,000
Tell me! Why?

6
00:00:52,833 --> 00:00:55,458
Answer me, Mom...! Answer me!

7
00:02:28,666 --> 00:02:30,208
[SOLDIER A]
Intruder in the Alicia Room!

8
00:02:30,291 --> 00:02:32,125
Intruder in the Alicia Room!

9
00:02:33,041 --> 00:02:34,416
There's only one of 'em in here!

10
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:37,750
Block off the exits...!
Don't move!

11
00:02:40,708 --> 00:02:41,958
[IZUMO]
Hold.

12
00:02:44,416 --> 00:02:45,500
[SECURITY A]
Commander Izumo...!

13
00:02:45,583 --> 00:02:47,958
Target's loose,
he could be dangerous!

14
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:51,500
Izumo? Wait-- it's that guy!

15
00:02:54,791 --> 00:02:57,291
Stand down, clear out at once...

16
00:02:58,333 --> 00:03:00,125
Wait until I give you the word.

17
00:03:00,208 --> 00:03:00,916
But Sir, I...

18
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,125
That's an order.

19
00:03:04,666 --> 00:03:06,500
Be careful; he's a tricky one.

20
00:03:11,458 --> 00:03:14,500
So, it's the boy
who can fly, is it...

21
00:03:15,166 --> 00:03:17,916
[IZUMO] I didn't expect
we'd meet again so soon.

22
00:03:20,583 --> 00:03:23,291
[AMATA] This woman...
This woman is my mother;

23
00:03:23,375 --> 00:03:25,791
what is she doing here...?

24
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:27,333
[AMATA]
Tell me!

25
00:03:29,791 --> 00:03:32,291
I will tell you of our sorrow...

26
00:03:32,375 --> 00:03:34,166
The death rattle of Altair...

27
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:36,041
The curse of Eve.

28
00:03:36,125 --> 00:03:46,083
[AMATA]
The curse... of what?

29
00:03:46,166 --> 00:03:53,958
[AMATA]
The curse... of what?

30
00:03:54,041 --> 00:03:55,166
 Oh, man...

31
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:57,125
That should keep us
safe for a bit longer.

32
00:03:57,208 --> 00:03:58,958
Good work, Yunoha, thanks.

33
00:03:59,041 --> 00:04:00,791
You feeling any better?

34
00:04:00,875 --> 00:04:03,791
Sorta... My throat's
still kinda scratchy.

35
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:08,541
Mine too...
Do you think the boys

36
00:04:08,625 --> 00:04:10,541
are doing all right out there?

37
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:12,083
They should be fine...

38
00:04:12,166 --> 00:04:15,166
I told them not to do...
anything too rash.

39
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:17,041
I sure hope they listen.

40
00:04:17,125 --> 00:04:19,625
And... And they promised...

41
00:04:20,708 --> 00:04:25,166
[MIKAGE] Bear in mind...
The price will be high.

42
00:04:28,083 --> 00:04:29,333
[YUNOHA]
Zessica?

43
00:04:30,458 --> 00:04:32,416
 Yeah...! Everything's fine!

44
00:04:34,375 --> 00:04:36,125
[YUNOHA]
It's so weird here...

45
00:04:36,208 --> 00:04:37,833
It's like the entire planet

46
00:04:37,916 --> 00:04:40,125
only has little slivers of sky.

47
00:04:40,208 --> 00:04:43,166
Yeah, right... 'weird'
doesn't even cover it.

48
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:45,375
[YUNOHA] Maybe that's why
"Flight of the Aquaria"

49
00:04:45,458 --> 00:04:47,208
is so important to them...

50
00:04:47,291 --> 00:04:48,541
Because everyone on Altair

51
00:04:48,625 --> 00:04:51,250
misses the view from up there...

52
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:54,500
I know Jin was
like that for sure...

53
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:06,791
Yunoha!

54
00:05:15,833 --> 00:05:18,166
Well... Shit's hittin'
the fan now...

55
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:18,833
Huh?

56
00:05:18,916 --> 00:05:20,208
Whoa!

57
00:05:21,625 --> 00:05:24,125
We're just not safe out
here in the open like this...

58
00:05:24,208 --> 00:05:25,625
Shrade sure picked a fine time

59
00:05:25,708 --> 00:05:27,250
to go off and reconoitter.

60
00:05:27,333 --> 00:05:30,208
Seriously... What a
friggin' mess, right?

61
00:05:30,291 --> 00:05:32,041
Huh?

62
00:05:45,458 --> 00:05:47,500
Yes, I hear it...

63
00:05:47,583 --> 00:05:50,875
This world dances to
a familiar melody...

64
00:05:50,958 --> 00:05:52,916
A cantata that hounds me.

65
00:05:54,166 --> 00:05:56,208
Sad, dejected sky...

66
00:05:56,291 --> 00:05:59,750
Not even your tears can
cleanse this dying land.

67
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:04,166
Ha. How strange...

68
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:08,458
This land and
I are kindred spirits...

69
00:06:08,541 --> 00:06:11,416
Our deaths, watching
from the wings...

70
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,541
awaiting the curtain fall.

71
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:18,375
I can feel your power waning...

72
00:06:18,458 --> 00:06:21,166
And I see the nexus draining it.

73
00:06:26,833 --> 00:06:28,750
[ANDY]
Let me out, douchebags...!

74
00:06:28,833 --> 00:06:32,041
You can't keep me
locked up here forever!

75
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:33,708
Let! Me! Out!!

76
00:06:36,083 --> 00:06:37,250
What am I saying...?

77
00:06:37,333 --> 00:06:40,625
You jerks did me a favor
bringing me down here.

78
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:41,916
Hold on, Mix...

79
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,791
Andy-Boy's coming
to your rescue!

80
00:06:46,375 --> 00:06:48,083
[MIKONO]
I am going to find him...

81
00:06:48,166 --> 00:06:51,541
I have to find him...
It's my purpose...

82
00:06:51,625 --> 00:06:53,791
I've worked too
hard to stop now!

83
00:06:55,958 --> 00:06:58,250
It's a good thing he
stands out in a crowd...

84
00:06:58,333 --> 00:07:00,666
Just describing him
got me this far.

85
00:07:01,791 --> 00:07:03,875
This is clearly the
role I was always

86
00:07:03,958 --> 00:07:05,708
meant to play, isn't it...?

87
00:07:05,791 --> 00:07:08,708
I'm tired of running
from myself...

88
00:07:08,791 --> 00:07:10,000
I'm gonna find the
High Commander

89
00:07:10,083 --> 00:07:11,750
and bring him back to us...

90
00:07:11,833 --> 00:07:13,166
Sound good, Shush?

91
00:07:45,458 --> 00:07:47,125
High Commander Fudo!

92
00:07:48,083 --> 00:07:50,416
Well, that certainly
took you long enough.

93
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:51,833
Come home...!

94
00:07:51,916 --> 00:07:54,583
I've spent days
looking all over for you.

95
00:07:54,666 --> 00:07:56,000
Looking for me?

96
00:07:56,083 --> 00:07:57,291
Yes, sir!

97
00:07:57,375 --> 00:07:59,666
And why, pray tell,
have you been doing that?

98
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:01,083
Huh...?

99
00:08:01,166 --> 00:08:03,916
I've been right there
alongside you the entire time...

100
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:04,791
What...?

101
00:08:04,875 --> 00:08:06,333
I was there in the marketplace,

102
00:08:06,416 --> 00:08:07,500
and on the trolley,

103
00:08:07,583 --> 00:08:09,583
and up and down
the city streets...

104
00:08:09,666 --> 00:08:12,875
In the time it takes lightning
to strike, I was there.

105
00:08:18,125 --> 00:08:19,291
But how?

106
00:08:19,375 --> 00:08:20,875
My physical being may travel

107
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:22,166
the breadth of the world,

108
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:24,333
yet still I remain unchanged...

109
00:08:24,416 --> 00:08:27,000
My soul may dwell in
the current of Eternity,

110
00:08:27,083 --> 00:08:29,416
but still
I remain immovable.

111
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:32,791
Unchanged and... immovable...?

112
00:08:33,708 --> 00:08:35,083
So then you're...?

113
00:08:35,166 --> 00:08:38,916
Yes... I am the Immovable One...

114
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,666
AKA... Gen Fudo!

115
00:08:51,708 --> 00:08:53,083
But that means...

116
00:08:53,166 --> 00:08:56,000
You've actually been alive
for twelve thousand years!

117
00:08:56,875 --> 00:08:58,833
You literally don't
know the half of it;

118
00:08:58,916 --> 00:09:00,166
I'm twice that age.

119
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:01,208
Hmm?

120
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:02,833
Now tell me, Mikono...

121
00:09:02,916 --> 00:09:06,041
Do you think you are
ready to learn the truth?

122
00:09:08,083 --> 00:09:09,916
Yes, sir; I'm more than ready...

123
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,583
I made a promise to
Amata and myself...

124
00:09:12,666 --> 00:09:16,958
To find you... And to bring
you back no matter what!

125
00:09:18,041 --> 00:09:20,791
Then come, girl... Let's go.

126
00:09:23,083 --> 00:09:25,166
[IZUMO] The truth of
what happened here...

127
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:28,041
can only be described as cruel.

128
00:09:28,583 --> 00:09:31,291
Fourteen years ago, it began...

129
00:09:31,375 --> 00:09:32,958
All of our Iguras...

130
00:09:33,041 --> 00:09:34,708
What your people call women...

131
00:09:34,791 --> 00:09:36,875
grew sick and perished.

132
00:09:38,333 --> 00:09:42,708
[AMATA]
That's... That's Jin!

133
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:47,750
[IZUMO] Yes, Jin Muso-- Altair's
last naturally born child...

134
00:09:47,833 --> 00:09:49,416
Don't you see...?

135
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,750
A world devoid of
precious Iguras

136
00:09:51,833 --> 00:09:54,416
is no more than
a garden of death!

137
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,625
And that's why you've
been coming to Vega,

138
00:09:56,708 --> 00:09:58,625
to kidnap our women.

139
00:09:58,708 --> 00:10:00,625
We must find a new mother...

140
00:10:00,708 --> 00:10:04,500
A chance to revitalize Altair,
to bring it back from the Abyss.

141
00:10:04,583 --> 00:10:07,333
Bastard...
You don't have the right!

142
00:10:11,833 --> 00:10:15,791
[IZUMO] Impudent child...
Hear the whole story...

143
00:10:15,875 --> 00:10:18,958
What I've told you
is just the beginning...

144
00:10:19,041 --> 00:10:21,625
The denouement is
far more harrowing.

145
00:10:28,333 --> 00:10:29,833
Here I come, Mix!

146
00:10:36,833 --> 00:10:37,541
Where am I?

147
00:10:37,625 --> 00:10:39,541
Who are you...?! Freeze!

148
00:10:40,333 --> 00:10:41,375
Where is she...?

149
00:10:41,458 --> 00:10:43,166
Tell me where
you're keeping Mix!

150
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:44,750
[SECURITY C]
Who's Mix?

151
00:10:44,833 --> 00:10:45,958
The chick with the knockers...!

152
00:10:46,041 --> 00:10:47,125
Your turd of a boss snagged her,

153
00:10:47,208 --> 00:10:48,666
and I'm taking her back.

154
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:52,166
[SECURITY C]
A girl... do you mean--

155
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:53,833
[ANDY]
Hold it right there!

156
00:10:54,458 --> 00:10:56,833
I said don't move!

157
00:10:56,916 --> 00:11:00,708
Or else the next hole
I make goes right... here.

158
00:11:00,791 --> 00:11:02,333
P-Please...!
Don't, I'll tell you.

159
00:11:02,416 --> 00:11:03,458
Spit it out!

160
00:11:03,541 --> 00:11:05,083
[SECURITY D]
Hey! What's going on here?

161
00:11:10,541 --> 00:11:12,541
Son of a bitch!

162
00:11:19,833 --> 00:11:22,500
Tell your buddies
I let you off easy.

163
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,375
That was close...
Gotta be creative,

164
00:11:25,458 --> 00:11:28,041
since the ol' mojo
doesn't work on living things.

165
00:11:28,125 --> 00:11:29,333
He got away.

166
00:11:29,416 --> 00:11:31,291
The prisoner has escaped below!

167
00:11:33,875 --> 00:11:35,416
I'm gonna find you, hot stuff...

168
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:38,208
I'll carry you in my
arms outta this cesspool...

[MIKONO]
Where are we headed?

171
00:11:52,166 --> 00:11:56,166
Toward our destiny...
I present this donut...

172
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:58,500
What is the first thing
that comes to mind?

173
00:11:58,583 --> 00:12:03,500
Uh, well I... Prefer
strawberry... I guess...

174
00:12:03,833 --> 00:12:06,625
My hand seems to hold
this donut stationary...

175
00:12:06,708 --> 00:12:09,000
But in reality, it powers
across the waves

176
00:12:09,083 --> 00:12:11,375
at a speed equal
to that of the boat's.

177
00:12:11,458 --> 00:12:13,416
I don't get it...

178
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,625
A donut traversing
the high seas...

179
00:12:15,708 --> 00:12:18,083
Have you no sense
of wonder, child?

180
00:12:20,458 --> 00:12:22,500
And now it has vanished...

181
00:12:22,583 --> 00:12:24,375
or so it would seem.

182
00:12:25,375 --> 00:12:26,541
As in a paradox,

183
00:12:26,625 --> 00:12:29,791
its mere proximity
renders it unnoticeable.

184
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:35,500
[MIKONO] Now it's travelling to
your stomach, Commander.

Are you so certain?

186
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:40,875
[FUDO]
The donut will be broken down

187
00:12:40,958 --> 00:12:44,583
to its base components,
yet will remain...

188
00:12:44,666 --> 00:12:47,000
Its molecules will
become a part of me,...

189
00:12:47,083 --> 00:12:50,166

share in my immutability.

I thought you were going
to tell me the 'truth'.

A rather powerful entity
was rendered Immovable...

194
00:13:00,416 --> 00:13:02,416
And so has sustained this planet

for the last twelve millennia.

you were known as Gen?

The Legendary
Aquarion of myth...

The Curse of Eve did not end

211
00:13:56,625 --> 00:13:59,125
with the decimation of
our native born Iguras.

212

Tragically, it was
only the beginning...

For even the Iguras we took

from your home

A cruel twist to our
ongoing nightmare.

resist the curse...

We found... the Rare Iguras.

The Rare... Iguras?

to be our True Eve.

00:19:54,041 --> 00:19:57,625
If that really is Mix, then I...

325
00:19:57,708 --> 00:20:00,250
then I am the
worst person ever...

326
00:20:00,333 --> 00:20:01,708
I found the woman I love

327
00:20:01,791 --> 00:20:04,541
and I didn't even
recognize her...

328
00:20:04,625 --> 00:20:07,250
I'm about...
To lose it you guys...

329
00:20:07,333 --> 00:20:08,333
Yunoha, no!

330
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:11,333
I'm running...
out of steam here too...

331
00:20:11,416 --> 00:20:12,958
[AMATA] Shrade, we've got
to get moving...!

332
00:20:13,041 --> 00:20:14,916
The girls can't hold
on much longer!

333
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,083
I see that...

334
00:20:16,166 --> 00:20:17,958
But even if we can
break through her seal,

335
00:20:18,041 --> 00:20:19,875
how do we get off
of this planet?

336
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,833
Miiiix!

337
00:20:28,125 --> 00:20:31,500
Miiiix!

338
00:20:32,625 --> 00:20:34,166
Andy, no!

339
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:36,750
[ANDY]
What do you want from me...?

340
00:20:39,708 --> 00:20:41,958
His elemental
power's going wild!

341
00:20:42,041 --> 00:20:44,250
He's ripping a hole in thin air!

342
00:20:44,333 --> 00:20:47,583
He's forming a nano-black hole!

343
00:20:52,083 --> 00:20:54,708
Andy... please
you've gotta stop this!

344
00:20:54,791 --> 00:20:57,000
Not yet... I'll act
as conductor...

345
00:20:57,083 --> 00:20:59,666
Play your concerto
of darkness, Andy!

346
00:21:03,041 --> 00:21:05,458
There is a note where
these scales meet...

347
00:21:05,541 --> 00:21:07,166
And in its nexus is the power

348
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:09,208
to pierce through dimensions!

349
00:21:14,708 --> 00:21:16,916
Andy... take all
of your power...

350
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,291
and focus it on my arrow!

351
00:21:20,916 --> 00:21:23,875
Black Hole... Arrow!

352
00:21:37,458 --> 00:21:40,708
[AMATA]
Yes! It opened the gate!

353
00:21:40,791 --> 00:21:44,458
Amata... You take it from here.

354
00:21:52,916 --> 00:21:55,000
Yunoha... Zessica!

355
00:21:56,500 --> 00:22:00,500
Mix, no...! We can't leave her!

356
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:07,916
You fool...

357
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,250
The only name
I have ever known is Mixy.

358
00:22:12,791 --> 00:22:16,625
[MIKAGE] Splendid,
absolutely delightful...

359
00:22:16,708 --> 00:22:18,625
each piece of the
puzzle coming together

360
00:22:18,708 --> 00:22:21,208
to form something greater.

361
00:22:21,291 --> 00:22:24,083
The slumbering
will soon awaken...

362
00:22:24,166 --> 00:22:28,125
the return of Solar Wing
draws ever nearer.

363
00:22:29,625 --> 00:22:33,458
Even the discarded refuse
Eve played her part well.

364
00:22:35,625 --> 00:22:38,583
Soon... little puzzle piece...

365
00:22:38,666 --> 00:22:41,166
Soon, you too shall awaken.

366
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:44,125
But the puzzle will
only be completed...

367
00:22:44,208 --> 00:22:46,833
when you return to
where it all started...

368
00:22:47,458 --> 00:22:49,541
The day the world began.

369
00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:25,000
[AMATA]
There's so much I've lost,

370
00:24:25,083 --> 00:24:27,083
so much I'm going to lose...

371
00:24:27,166 --> 00:24:29,500
If I could go back to
where everything began,

372
00:24:29,583 --> 00:24:30,541
and rewind it...

373
00:24:30,625 --> 00:24:31,958
like it never happened...

374
00:24:32,041 --> 00:24:37,000
Would I do it all over again...?
Next time: "Kiss."
