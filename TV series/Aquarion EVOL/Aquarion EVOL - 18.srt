00:00:22,708 --> 00:00:24,333
[DONAR]
Commander Fudo's gone?

2
00:00:24,416 --> 00:00:26,666
[CREA]
Yes, though he left us a note...

3
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:29,458
It seems he departed
early this morning.

4
00:00:30,708 --> 00:00:32,375
He's
gone off to...

5
00:00:32,458 --> 00:00:35,375
look for... the
Legendary Aquarion?

6
00:00:35,458 --> 00:00:38,000
Do you think it possible
Fudo has a lead on it?

7
00:00:38,083 --> 00:00:39,416
I've no idea...

8
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:41,333
I guess it's conceivable
he found something

9
00:00:41,416 --> 00:00:44,416
that piqued his interest
in the Book of Twin Stars.

10
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:46,458
[DONAR]
The Book of Twin Stars?

11
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:50,958
Take this!

12
00:00:57,333 --> 00:01:00,208
Oh no...! Please
tell me this isn't real!

13
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,791
[CIERRO]
You guys! Here he is!

14
00:01:05,125 --> 00:01:06,958
[MALLOY] This is gettin'
kinda out of hand.

15
00:01:07,041 --> 00:01:09,166
[YUNOHA]
Andy!

16
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:10,958
[EI] What in the world's
wrong with him?

17
00:01:11,041 --> 00:01:13,166
[MALLOY]
He's a hero, why's he depressed?

18
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:13,833
[SAZANKA]
Duh...!

19
00:01:13,916 --> 00:01:15,291
He's not depressed.

20
00:01:15,375 --> 00:01:17,750
He's clearly digging us a
super awesome hot spring!

21
00:01:17,833 --> 00:01:20,458
This is nuts...
What happened out there?

22
00:01:21,625 --> 00:01:23,708
So Mix... You know
what this is about?

23
00:01:23,791 --> 00:01:24,791
[MIX]
Don't bring me into this!

24
00:01:24,875 --> 00:01:26,541
I don't have a clue. I mean...

25
00:01:26,625 --> 00:01:29,000
Sorry, your guess is
as good as mine. Ugh!

26
00:01:38,416 --> 00:01:39,958
Man... This sucks.

27
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:15,166
[ZESSICA]
A concert?

28
00:03:16,708 --> 00:03:18,916
Thanks, yeah.
I'll think about it.

29
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,541
Don't think about it,

30
00:03:20,625 --> 00:03:22,083
just come with me,
it'll be fun...

31
00:03:22,166 --> 00:03:24,625
I promise... Bye.

32
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:29,708
[SAZANKA]
How many times is that now...?

33
00:03:29,791 --> 00:03:33,083
The new look's really
reelin' in the guys, huh?

34
00:03:34,708 --> 00:03:36,958
This tastes awfully
bland for how it looks.

35
00:03:37,041 --> 00:03:38,416
[SAZANKA] I still can't
get over you laying

36
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,416
your cards on the
table to Amata...

37
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:43,000
No joke... That took
some serious balls.

38
00:03:43,083 --> 00:03:45,083
Sorry... I feel like
my advice might

39
00:03:45,166 --> 00:03:47,541
have led you down
the wrong path of action.

40
00:03:47,625 --> 00:03:50,541
It's fine... I said it
'cause I wanted to.

41
00:03:50,625 --> 00:03:53,583
'Sides, it helped me
get on with my life.

42
00:03:54,541 --> 00:03:56,375
Really?

43
00:03:56,958 --> 00:03:59,208
Think so...
Just cross your fingers

44
00:03:59,291 --> 00:04:01,416
I'm not trekkin'
down another dead end.

45
00:04:04,666 --> 00:04:05,916
[MALE CADET]
Miss Suzushiro!

46
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:06,958
[MIKONO]
Yes?

47
00:04:07,041 --> 00:04:08,083
[MALE CADET]
Glad I ran into you...

48
00:04:08,166 --> 00:04:10,041
I was going to take
this to your room.

49
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:11,541
Here you go.

50
00:04:11,625 --> 00:04:12,875
[MIKONO]
Thanks a lot.

51
00:04:16,541 --> 00:04:18,083
Mikono, hey!

52
00:04:19,791 --> 00:04:21,583
Oh... Sorry about that...

53
00:04:21,666 --> 00:04:23,916
I wasn't trying to hide
this or anything...

54
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,250
It's just a letter
from my Father.

55
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:27,916
[AMATA]
Your father?

56
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,958
[MIKONO]
We don't exactly get along.

57
00:04:30,041 --> 00:04:31,625
[AMATA]
Oh.

58
00:04:31,708 --> 00:04:33,541
Getting this was pretty much

59
00:04:33,625 --> 00:04:34,791
the last thing I expected...

60
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:36,708
Who knows, maybe he's
just worried about me?

61
00:04:36,791 --> 00:04:38,000
Well he's a parent, right...?

62
00:04:38,083 --> 00:04:39,916
That's kinda their
job... Though...

63
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,458
I wouldn't really
know firsthand.

64
00:04:41,541 --> 00:04:43,083
Oh gosh, I'm sorry...!

65
00:04:43,166 --> 00:04:45,833
I remember my mom some...

66
00:04:45,916 --> 00:04:48,833
'Course it was a long time ago.

67
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:52,625
But my Dad...?
I draw a big, fat blank.

68
00:04:55,791 --> 00:04:59,041
[AMATA] Look, Mikono...
I think we need to talk.

69
00:04:59,125 --> 00:05:00,750
Let me take a wild guess.

70
00:05:00,833 --> 00:05:05,000
That guy... That's what you
wanna talk about, huh?

71
00:05:05,416 --> 00:05:06,708
[MIKONO]
Stop this!

72
00:05:06,791 --> 00:05:08,500
Don't do this...

73
00:05:08,583 --> 00:05:09,916
Don't shoot him.

74
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,041
Please let him live!

75
00:05:12,125 --> 00:05:13,500
[AMATA]
Okay, first...

76
00:05:13,583 --> 00:05:15,166
Please know I'm not trying
to blame you for anything...

77
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:16,666
What happened happened,

78
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:18,791
but we're still gonna have
to find a way to work together!

79
00:05:18,875 --> 00:05:20,833
You think I don't know that...?!

80
00:05:20,916 --> 00:05:23,625
I'm supposed to connect
everybody, remember?

81
00:05:23,708 --> 00:05:25,541
That's my power.

82
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:28,416
But... I don't know if I can!

83
00:05:29,916 --> 00:05:31,000
Mikono, wait!

84
00:05:49,208 --> 00:05:50,708
This can't be.

85
00:05:54,791 --> 00:05:57,291
[CAYENNE] What's the
matter with you? Well?

86
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:58,875
[MIKONO]
Dad sent you a letter,

87
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:01,416
but somehow it got
delivered to me by mistake.

88
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:04,791
Sorry, I opened it before
I realized it, though.

89
00:06:04,875 --> 00:06:07,708
Yeah, his hand writing
is like a four year old's...

90
00:06:07,791 --> 00:06:09,041
I'm actually more confused

91
00:06:09,125 --> 00:06:11,500
about why he'd send me
this in the first place...

92
00:06:11,583 --> 00:06:12,708
You sure you're okay?

93
00:06:12,791 --> 00:06:14,791
Um... Yeah...

94
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:16,833
I'm fine, I'll see ya tomorrow!

95
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:18,791
Wait, Mikono!

96
00:06:25,041 --> 00:06:27,333
[MIKONO]
How could I be so stupid...?

97
00:06:27,416 --> 00:06:29,500
I should have known
better than to read it.

98
00:06:30,625 --> 00:06:33,166
[MIKONO'S FATHER] Her being
at the academy confounds me:

99
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:35,708
I doubt I'll ever
understand their decision...

100
00:06:35,791 --> 00:06:37,541
My only hope is
that she isn't holding

101
00:06:37,625 --> 00:06:40,375
you back the way
she tended to at home.

102
00:06:40,458 --> 00:06:43,708
Harsh truth: the poor
girl's dead weight.

103
00:06:43,791 --> 00:06:45,375
Nothing more.

104
00:06:46,166 --> 00:06:47,333
If you need, say the word

105
00:06:47,416 --> 00:06:49,750
and I'll have her
removed from Neo-DEAVA.

106
00:06:49,833 --> 00:06:51,250
Better she's out of your hair;

107
00:06:51,333 --> 00:06:53,875
at least at home
she's less of a burden.

108
00:06:54,375 --> 00:06:56,541
[MIKONO]
In Father's eyes, I'm nothing...

109
00:06:56,625 --> 00:06:58,041
Always have been.

110
00:06:58,666 --> 00:06:59,750
[MIX]
Mikono?

111
00:07:05,791 --> 00:07:07,166
[MIKONO]
You're worried about Andy?

112
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:10,875
[MIX] I am. He's rather
depressed right now...

113
00:07:10,958 --> 00:07:13,333
And I'm pretty sure
it's my fault.

114
00:07:13,416 --> 00:07:14,875
[MIKONO]
Yeah but...

115
00:07:14,958 --> 00:07:17,291
I thought you were finally
starting to get along.

116
00:07:17,375 --> 00:07:20,833
[MIX] Well, we were...
Until the field trip.

117
00:07:20,916 --> 00:07:22,333
The worst part is,

118
00:07:22,416 --> 00:07:25,000
I go around telling people
to say how they truly feel...

119
00:07:25,083 --> 00:07:26,541
But when push came to shove,

120
00:07:26,625 --> 00:07:29,500
I didn't even have the decency
to practice what I preach...

121
00:07:29,583 --> 00:07:31,041
I know it doesn't make sense,

122
00:07:31,125 --> 00:07:34,083
but it's like I see my father
in every single boy I meet.

123
00:07:34,166 --> 00:07:35,583
Your father?

124
00:07:35,666 --> 00:07:37,375
It sounds crazy, right...?

125
00:07:37,458 --> 00:07:40,208
But that's why I have
the men issues I do.

126
00:07:40,708 --> 00:07:42,875
So how about you, Mikono...?

127
00:07:42,958 --> 00:07:45,375
You and your Dad...
Do you get along?

128
00:07:45,458 --> 00:07:48,375
Oh well... We uh--

129
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:52,291
Papa... I uh...

130
00:07:52,375 --> 00:07:54,625
Spit it out, Mikono.

131
00:07:57,125 --> 00:07:59,375
[MIKONO'S FATHER]
Ugh... Stop wasting my time.

132
00:08:00,125 --> 00:08:01,666
[MIKONO]
He was always a stern man,

133
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:04,541
and I was very afraid of
what he thought of me.

134
00:08:04,625 --> 00:08:06,333
Whenever I was about to speak...

135
00:08:06,416 --> 00:08:08,083
I'd get nervous he'd
be upset with me

136
00:08:08,166 --> 00:08:09,750
so I'd just freeze up...

137
00:08:09,833 --> 00:08:11,208
And then he'd be even more angry

138
00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:13,541
that I was too afraid
to speak my mind.

139
00:08:13,625 --> 00:08:19,250
I see. I guess
we'll never get it...

140
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:21,916
I mean, if we can't even
understand our own dads...

141
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,166
How are we supposed
to get a grasp

142
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:25,875
on what makes the rest
of them tick, right?

143
00:08:30,291 --> 00:08:35,041
Hey. I've always been
curious... Boy or girl?

144
00:08:35,125 --> 00:08:36,541
Yeah I don't really know.

145
00:08:47,208 --> 00:08:48,458
Zessica?

146
00:08:48,541 --> 00:08:51,500
Why are you
practicing at this hour?

147
00:08:51,583 --> 00:08:53,458
'Cause I'm a total badass...

148
00:08:53,541 --> 00:08:54,333
And at the end of the day,

149
00:08:54,416 --> 00:08:56,125
that's what I was meant to be.

150
00:08:56,208 --> 00:08:58,541
I know I've been a little
on the down side lately...

151
00:08:58,625 --> 00:09:00,416
So I'm gonna put my all of focus

152
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:04,208
back into training.
Anyway... G'night!

153
00:09:06,416 --> 00:09:07,666
Oh goodness.

154
00:09:17,416 --> 00:09:23,708
[ZESSICA]
What in the world am I doing?

155
00:09:23,791 --> 00:09:25,416
Just another dead end.

156
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:35,208
[ATTENDENT] Iron Sea's
operating level, sir...

157
00:09:35,291 --> 00:09:37,083
has dropped below forty percent.

158
00:09:37,166 --> 00:09:38,583
[TECH A] The amount of
energy we're expending

00:09:38,666 --> 00:09:41,375
for dimensional transport is
what's hurting us the most.

160
00:09:41,458 --> 00:09:45,000
[TECH C] I'm afraid we can no
longer allow travel to Vega...

161
00:09:45,083 --> 00:09:48,166
If we continue to leech energy
from the civic infrastructure,

162
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:50,250
large-scale riots
will be likely.

163
00:09:51,916 --> 00:09:53,041
It's the end of the line,

164
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:55,375
no point in
pretending otherwise.

165
00:09:56,833 --> 00:09:58,416
Where is Kagura?

166
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:01,875
[ATTENDENT] I'm sorry, sir...
I'm afraid we don't know.

167
00:10:01,958 --> 00:10:04,750
[IZUMO] No doubt this
is Mikage's handiwork...

168
00:10:04,833 --> 00:10:07,250
He cares for Altair's
fate only insofar

169
00:10:07,333 --> 00:10:09,750
as it caters
to his ends.

170
00:10:13,583 --> 00:10:16,625
[IZUMO] Prepare the
Ahura Gnis for battle.

171
00:10:16,708 --> 00:10:18,333
[ATTENDENT]
But sir?

172
00:10:19,083 --> 00:10:21,791
I'll go to Vega myself.

173
00:10:21,875 --> 00:10:23,291
It's time to breathe the air

174
00:10:23,375 --> 00:10:25,541
of the battlefield once more...

175
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:28,208
Altair will make
one final stand.

176
00:10:38,291 --> 00:10:41,041
[IZUMO] Alicia... For the
sake of bringing

177
00:10:41,125 --> 00:10:43,541
this world back to
its former greatness...

178
00:10:43,625 --> 00:10:47,500
I will venture out in
search of the True Eve.

179
00:10:47,916 --> 00:10:51,291
And perhaps I'll encounter
something else of use.

180
00:10:51,375 --> 00:10:55,458
The son you left behind...
Our son.

181
00:11:01,375 --> 00:11:02,875
[CAYENNE]
You read it, didn't you?

182
00:11:03,625 --> 00:11:05,333
Dad's letter, I mean.

183
00:11:05,416 --> 00:11:08,375
[MIKONO]
I'm really sorry.

184
00:11:08,458 --> 00:11:12,250
[CAYENNE] There's nothing
for you to be sorry for.

185
00:11:12,333 --> 00:11:14,500
Don't let it get you down, okay?

186
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,250
That's just Dad...

187
00:11:16,333 --> 00:11:18,083
He always freaks out
about stupid stuff

188
00:11:18,166 --> 00:11:20,375
when he has no reason to.

189
00:11:20,458 --> 00:11:24,291
Cayenne... If I'm in
the way, send me home.

190
00:11:24,375 --> 00:11:25,833
[CAYENNE]
In the way?

191
00:11:25,916 --> 00:11:27,125
[MIKONO]
Father's probably right...

192
00:11:27,208 --> 00:11:29,416
Just by being here,
I'm holding you back

193
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,291
from whatever
you're meant for...

194
00:11:31,375 --> 00:11:32,625
All I am is dead weight.

195
00:11:32,708 --> 00:11:35,250
If I'm gonna be useless
I should do it at home.

196
00:11:35,333 --> 00:11:36,208
Look at me.

197
00:11:37,708 --> 00:11:42,166
Ow...! Hey, that hurt...!
What was that for?

198
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:43,541
Who cares what he thinks...?

199
00:11:43,625 --> 00:11:46,333
Try and have a bit more
confidence in yourself.

200
00:11:47,125 --> 00:11:48,833
Your whole life,
you've never spoken out

201
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:50,458
or stood up for anything
because you've been

202
00:11:50,541 --> 00:11:52,583
too afraid of making
other people angry...

203
00:11:52,666 --> 00:11:54,458
Listen... Just 'cause
someone's upset with you,

204
00:11:54,541 --> 00:11:58,791
you don't have to let
your feelings get hurt.

205
00:11:58,875 --> 00:12:01,541
You're not useless...
Or a coward...

206
00:12:01,625 --> 00:12:02,708
Though for most of my life,

207
00:12:02,791 --> 00:12:05,041
I'll admit, I thought you were.

208
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:07,916
But, then... I met this guy...

209
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,041
And he convinced me otherwise.

210
00:12:11,333 --> 00:12:12,625
Look, I realize
I haven't known her

211
00:12:12,708 --> 00:12:14,125
as long as you have...

212
00:12:14,208 --> 00:12:16,416
But I think she's
changed since then...

213
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:17,875
Cut her some slack.

214
00:12:17,958 --> 00:12:19,833
You may think she's a coward...

215
00:12:19,916 --> 00:12:21,208
But you're wrong, Mikono's brave

216
00:12:21,291 --> 00:12:24,041
and she's trying to
be a stronger person!

217
00:12:24,125 --> 00:12:26,458
Amata seriously said that?

218
00:12:26,541 --> 00:12:28,833
[CAYENNE] Yeah, and as much
as I hate to admit it,

219
00:12:28,916 --> 00:12:30,000
he was right...

220
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:31,750
You're a completely
different person.

221
00:12:33,333 --> 00:12:36,791
Honestly, I can't wait
for Dad to see it himself.

222
00:12:37,208 --> 00:12:39,500
Thank you, Cayenne.

223
00:12:39,583 --> 00:12:41,833
[alarm sounding]

224
00:12:53,833 --> 00:12:56,166
There's a piece
I've never heard before.

225
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:59,958
It's strong...
Intense, powerful sound.

226
00:13:03,833 --> 00:13:07,208
[IZUMO] The sea...
It's making me nostalgic.

227
00:13:07,291 --> 00:13:10,416
This is indeed the
Vega of my youth.

228
00:13:11,208 --> 00:13:12,833
[MIKAGE]
Oh, Izumo...

229
00:13:12,916 --> 00:13:16,541
Do you yearn for a flower
to bloom after so long?

230
00:13:16,625 --> 00:13:18,750
Or conversely,
do you seek the fruit

231
00:13:18,833 --> 00:13:21,541
that fell from the tree
of your own devising?

232
00:13:23,041 --> 00:13:24,708
[EI]
They're closing in on us, fast!

233
00:13:24,791 --> 00:13:28,416
[DONAR] Seems we've got a boss
battle on our hands, eh?

234
00:13:29,416 --> 00:13:30,416
Andy! You're late!

235
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:32,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

236
00:13:38,375 --> 00:13:39,625
Sure you're up for this?

237
00:13:39,708 --> 00:13:42,541
Dude. I'm cool,
just get off my back.

238
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:49,833
Andy, no!

239
00:13:49,916 --> 00:13:50,916
Stop it!

240
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,583
No digging in the
control room, man!

241
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:53,750
Forget him...

242
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:56,333
We can't put the kid
out there like this.

243
00:13:56,416 --> 00:13:58,250
We've got five usable
Vectors on hand...

244
00:13:58,333 --> 00:14:00,833
Use the remaining units
to back up Aquarion...!

245
00:14:00,916 --> 00:14:03,333
Which Elements do we send?

246
00:14:03,416 --> 00:14:04,750
You should make that call.

247
00:14:04,833 --> 00:14:06,875
Cayenne. Amata... And last--

248
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:09,000
I'll go Commander!

249
00:14:09,458 --> 00:14:12,083
You can't... It's too
dangerous, ladies!

250
00:14:12,166 --> 00:14:14,041
Please, you have
to let me do this...!

251
00:14:14,125 --> 00:14:15,958
Fighting the enemy
is all I have!

252
00:14:16,041 --> 00:14:17,250
She's right...

253
00:14:17,333 --> 00:14:19,208
At this moment we're
not girls we're fighters!

254
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:20,375
We can stop them...!

255
00:14:20,458 --> 00:14:22,083
Please give us a chance!

256
00:14:22,166 --> 00:14:23,666
I'm sorry, but no.

257
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:25,250
[CREA]
The cadets are right...

258
00:14:25,333 --> 00:14:27,583
There's no point in tying
one arm behind our back;

259
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:30,125
what this needs
is a lady's touch.

260
00:14:30,875 --> 00:14:34,708
[CREA] Zen... I hope
I'm doing as you would.

261
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:35,916
Fine...

262
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,916
Cayenne and Mix,
take the support vectors...!

263
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,500
Zessica, Amata,
Malloy take Aquarion!

264
00:14:40,583 --> 00:14:41,625
Roger that!

265
00:14:43,791 --> 00:14:44,791
I'm worried about her...

266
00:14:44,875 --> 00:14:46,791
Zessica's a bit too excitable.

267
00:14:46,875 --> 00:14:49,791
I agree... She's overzealous.

268
00:14:49,875 --> 00:14:52,541
I have a terrible
feeling about this.

269
00:14:56,833 --> 00:14:59,958
[ZESSICA] Time to merge...
I'll be the head... Got it?!

270
00:15:00,041 --> 00:15:01,083
But, Zessica--

271
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:02,291
[MALLOY]
Sounds like a plan!

272
00:15:02,375 --> 00:15:06,875
Okay, Heartbreak Merge!
Go...! Aquarion!

273
00:15:11,166 --> 00:15:14,916
Even if it's only for battle...
I can be with Amata like this!

274
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,416
I can feel Zessica's heartache!

275
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:20,333
This merge is--
out of this world!

276
00:15:21,416 --> 00:15:24,291
[ZESSICA]
Aquarion... Gepard!

277
00:15:27,625 --> 00:15:30,041
We'll make sure these
grunts stay off your back!

278
00:15:31,208 --> 00:15:32,041
[CAYENNE]
We may be in Vectors,

279
00:15:32,125 --> 00:15:33,916
but we'll still take you down!

280
00:15:44,916 --> 00:15:46,750
Time to put an end to this!

281
00:15:49,541 --> 00:15:50,708
Valiant effort...

282
00:15:50,791 --> 00:15:52,916
But I'm afraid it
will not be enough.

283
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:56,541
No way!

284
00:15:56,625 --> 00:15:57,791
[MALLOY]
It barely hurt him.

285
00:16:09,333 --> 00:16:10,125
[DONAR]
Damage report!

286
00:16:10,208 --> 00:16:11,458
Not good, sir...

287
00:16:11,541 --> 00:16:13,458
Westside barriers have
been completely destroyed!

288
00:16:13,541 --> 00:16:15,000
It absorbed Gepard's laser beam,

289
00:16:15,083 --> 00:16:17,333
amplified it and fired
it right back at us!

290
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,458
[ZESSICA]
Try these on for size!

291
00:16:23,416 --> 00:16:26,916
Youthful passion is little more
than a quaint relic on Altair...

292
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,125
Try as you might,
I'm impervious!

293
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,583
Zessica, you have to calm down!

294
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:42,916
Stop shooting him,
it's too dangerous...!

295
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,833
Let's try to get in closer.

296
00:16:44,916 --> 00:16:46,875
I know what to do, okay?!

297
00:16:50,416 --> 00:16:52,250
Now...! Back me up, Malloy!

298
00:16:52,333 --> 00:16:56,208
I'm with you, Zessica!
The Curse of Malloy!

299
00:16:56,291 --> 00:16:57,666
Contrary Twister!

300
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:10,333
Curse of Malloy! Curse of
Malloy! Curse of Malloy!

301
00:17:10,416 --> 00:17:11,791
Yeah... Feel good?!

302
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:16,958
Fragility. How interesting...

303
00:17:17,041 --> 00:17:18,750
However, you will often find

304
00:17:18,833 --> 00:17:21,916
that the young are far
more feeble than the old.

305
00:17:24,041 --> 00:17:26,750
I prefer to avoid
wholesale destruction...

306
00:17:26,833 --> 00:17:28,791
So let me demonstrate
the vast gap

307
00:17:28,875 --> 00:17:30,625
between our powers.

308
00:17:30,708 --> 00:17:33,000
[ZESSICA] One more time...
Contrary twister!

309
00:17:34,625 --> 00:17:36,416
That will not work twice!

310
00:17:41,583 --> 00:17:43,333
They need help!

311
00:17:46,625 --> 00:17:48,208
Their merge just broke apart!

312
00:17:48,291 --> 00:17:49,541
Malloy's unconscious!

313
00:17:49,625 --> 00:17:50,875
The blast knocked him out!

314
00:17:50,958 --> 00:17:53,375
Vector Y is flying on autopilot!

315
00:17:53,458 --> 00:17:54,708
Put me in, please!

316
00:17:54,791 --> 00:17:57,125
Element change! Mikono, go!

317
00:17:57,208 --> 00:17:58,958
Cayenne and Amata,
you merge with her!

318
00:17:59,041 --> 00:18:00,791
Zessica, back them up!

319
00:18:00,875 --> 00:18:02,250
Don't do this!

320
00:18:02,333 --> 00:18:04,375
[DONAR] You're way too
out of control today...

321
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:07,166
You need to pull
yourself together!

322
00:18:09,375 --> 00:18:12,250
Amata... Cayenne...
Prepare to merge!

323
00:18:15,666 --> 00:18:17,750
[EI] Incoming! Enemies
approaching the island!

324
00:18:17,833 --> 00:18:19,791
Doesn't look like they're
preparing an attack...

325
00:18:19,875 --> 00:18:20,875
If that's not his game,

326
00:18:20,958 --> 00:18:22,875
what in the world
is he playing at?

327
00:18:28,333 --> 00:18:30,208
He's tapping into our
communications, sir!

328
00:18:30,291 --> 00:18:31,541
What?!

329
00:18:31,875 --> 00:18:33,625
Soldiers of Vega.

330
00:18:33,708 --> 00:18:36,958
Greetings, my name
is Izumo Kamurogi...

331
00:18:37,041 --> 00:18:38,833
Chief Commander of Altair...

332
00:18:38,916 --> 00:18:42,125
I am requesting a
parley with your leader.

333
00:18:42,208 --> 00:18:44,541
Sounds like he's
top of the food chain.

334
00:18:44,625 --> 00:18:45,708
That's really him?

335
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:49,458
I'm Crea Dolosera...

336
00:18:49,541 --> 00:18:52,250
As the Commander of
Neo-DEAVA, you talk to me.

337
00:18:52,333 --> 00:18:55,000
Well... Even your
Commander's an Igura...

338
00:18:55,083 --> 00:18:58,083
A girl... I was
under the impression

339
00:18:58,166 --> 00:19:00,750
women had no
talent for violence.

340
00:19:00,833 --> 00:19:03,208
Perhaps there's truth
in what you say...

341
00:19:03,291 --> 00:19:05,541
However... I'd urge you
to consider the behavior

342
00:19:05,625 --> 00:19:08,083
of a lioness
protecting her cubs.

343
00:19:08,166 --> 00:19:09,958
Touché, Commander...

344
00:19:10,041 --> 00:19:11,333
Our demands are quite simple:

345
00:19:11,416 --> 00:19:12,833
we require of you
the most powerful

346
00:19:12,916 --> 00:19:15,416
Rare Igura among your ranks.

347
00:19:16,833 --> 00:19:18,208
The most powerful girl...

348
00:19:18,291 --> 00:19:19,916
The strongest we have.

349
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,208
[IZUMO] I have no desire
to level this world,

350
00:19:23,291 --> 00:19:25,250
nor to wreak havoc
on its people...

351
00:19:25,333 --> 00:19:27,208
In return for a Rare Igura,

352
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:30,416
you've have my word that
Vega will be left alone.

353
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,416
There's no way...!
We'll die first!

354
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:33,791
Wait one moment!

355
00:19:33,875 --> 00:19:35,208
Miss Chairwoman?

356
00:19:35,291 --> 00:19:37,166
[CREA] If there's even a
slim chance we can settle

357
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:39,916
this diplomatically,
then I have to consider it...

358
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,083
If only Zen were here
to offer guidance...

359
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,250
Zessica's vector is on the move!

360
00:19:45,333 --> 00:19:47,583
She's heading
towards the Abductor!

361
00:19:49,083 --> 00:19:51,250
If you really want
a woman, I'll go!

362
00:19:51,333 --> 00:19:53,625
Take me right now! Maybe this is

363
00:19:53,708 --> 00:19:56,166
what I've been
looking for all along!

364
00:19:57,625 --> 00:19:59,708
Who's piloting that?

365
00:20:00,375 --> 00:20:08,625
It's a Rare Igura!

366
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:10,375
Stop, Zessica, have you
lost your mind?!

367
00:20:10,458 --> 00:20:12,375
You're not thinking
about this clearly!

368
00:20:12,458 --> 00:20:13,833
Don't throw your life away...

369
00:20:13,916 --> 00:20:15,583
There are people
who love you here!

370
00:20:15,666 --> 00:20:17,541
I have to... I must!

371
00:20:17,625 --> 00:20:19,541
She has a strong will...

372
00:20:19,625 --> 00:20:21,416
Her spirit will serve us well...

373
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:23,000
We'll take her.

374
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:29,875
Defend Vega Merge...!
Go...! Aquarion!

375
00:20:31,625 --> 00:20:34,291
[AMATA]
Aquarion... Evol!

376
00:20:36,583 --> 00:20:38,583
The flying
Machine Angel of legend.

377
00:20:45,083 --> 00:20:46,375
I can sense him...

378
00:20:46,458 --> 00:20:50,166
I feel his presence roiling
beneath the technology.

379
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:52,125
[MIKAGE] You must be
absolutely certain...

380
00:20:52,208 --> 00:20:56,083
Izumo... You must see
it with your own two eyes.

381
00:21:05,458 --> 00:21:07,958
Mother... Why would
there an image

382
00:21:08,041 --> 00:21:09,791
of her be there?

383
00:21:12,333 --> 00:21:14,625
[SHRADE]
A strange, powerful melody

384
00:21:14,708 --> 00:21:16,666
is cutting across
Amata's heartstrings.

385
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:22,041
Clear, quick...
Yet bitter... Obsidian.

386
00:21:22,125 --> 00:21:23,166
Mikage, you snake...!

387
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:24,750
This is all your doing...!

388
00:21:24,833 --> 00:21:28,541
Yet your actions thwarted
the machine angel...

389
00:21:28,958 --> 00:21:32,041
It's really him... It must be.

390
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:34,791
[CREA] Somebody tell me
what's going on!

391
00:21:34,875 --> 00:21:36,833
[DONAR] What are you doing,
Amata?! Attack him!

392
00:21:36,916 --> 00:21:38,250
Zessica!

393
00:21:39,458 --> 00:21:42,250
I won't let you take her...
No way in hell!

394
00:21:46,791 --> 00:21:48,791
Zessica, stop it...! Right now!

395
00:21:55,916 --> 00:21:56,666
Mix, no!

396
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:57,958
Are you there?!

397
00:21:58,041 --> 00:21:59,416
[MIKONO]
Mix, wake up!

398
00:22:04,708 --> 00:22:10,125
I'm stopping this!
Infinity punch!

399
00:22:11,208 --> 00:22:13,166
You and I will
meet again soon...

400
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:15,208
I can promise you that.

401
00:22:24,375 --> 00:22:28,000
It's my fault... She
sacrificed herself for me.

402
00:22:28,083 --> 00:22:28,875
She's gone.

403
00:22:28,958 --> 00:22:30,625
This is awful.

404
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,166
Mix, come back!

405
00:24:22,833 --> 00:24:25,125
[MIKONO] I hated myself
for being afraid...

406
00:24:25,208 --> 00:24:27,083
But maybe fear is
what gives us the power

407
00:24:27,166 --> 00:24:29,416
to overcome and
get on with our lives...

408
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:30,625
I know it's time for me to take

409
00:24:30,708 --> 00:24:32,250
my own step forward,

410
00:24:32,333 --> 00:24:34,166
no matter what
stands in my way...

411
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:36,375
Next time: "First Reunion."
