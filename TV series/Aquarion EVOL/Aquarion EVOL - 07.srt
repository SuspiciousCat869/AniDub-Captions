1
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:28,666
Come in.

2
00:00:32,166 --> 00:00:34,916
How are you feeling, Shrade?

3
00:00:37,583 --> 00:00:40,666
Hospitalized, yet enlightened
by the magnum opus

4
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:42,041
that is Aquarion.

5
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:46,833
I still hear its melodic
perfection. It haunts me.

6
00:00:47,458 --> 00:00:49,250
Just don't push yourself.

7
00:00:49,333 --> 00:00:51,375
Your body, it can't
handle much--

8
00:00:51,458 --> 00:00:53,500
I know. I don't care.

9
00:00:53,583 --> 00:00:55,833
I must master this instrument,

10
00:00:55,916 --> 00:00:58,625
even though hellfire
may consume me.

11
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,125
This is a special permission
waiver. It's yours.

12
00:01:07,208 --> 00:01:09,333
Use it or don't, but
know that this struggle

13
00:01:09,416 --> 00:01:12,000
will lead to an early death.

14
00:01:12,875 --> 00:01:15,291
Do not lose your own melody.

15
00:01:18,958 --> 00:01:20,750
This is my symphony.

16
00:01:20,833 --> 00:01:23,666
Life's joys contrasting
looming death.

17
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:03,250
Well I hope you're all
happy with yourselves.

18
00:03:03,333 --> 00:03:04,958
We've been sitting on our hands

19
00:03:05,041 --> 00:03:06,916
for a week since the
Berlin fell, ignoring

20
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,666
the social barriers plaguing
both bro and betty alike!

21
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:12,666
Let's make it happen people!

22
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:15,583
We must tear down the
walls of misunderstanding!

23
00:03:15,666 --> 00:03:17,458
Did I miss something?

24
00:03:17,541 --> 00:03:19,000
Andy never passes
up an opportunity

25
00:03:19,083 --> 00:03:20,833
to make an ass of himself.

26
00:03:20,916 --> 00:03:22,833
Andy, bro, I think
that's enough--

27
00:03:22,916 --> 00:03:24,583
Whose side you on?

28
00:03:24,666 --> 00:03:26,250
Friends, lend me your ears.

29
00:03:26,333 --> 00:03:29,125
The time has come
for a seating change!

30
00:03:29,208 --> 00:03:30,208
Pick your battles, dude.

31
00:03:30,291 --> 00:03:31,666
Objection! There will
be no switching!

32
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:35,458
If I have to sit next
to one of you boys,

33
00:03:35,541 --> 00:03:36,958
I'll never get the stink out!

34
00:03:37,041 --> 00:03:38,291
Change is good, right?!

35
00:03:38,375 --> 00:03:39,666
Yeah, I'm totally for it!

36
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:41,666
All those in favor?

37
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:44,958
This'll be fun! Dibs on
the seat next to Cayenne!

38
00:03:45,041 --> 00:03:46,041
Why you...

39
00:03:46,125 --> 00:03:47,625
Looks like we might've
pushed a button.

40
00:03:47,708 --> 00:03:51,708
This is perverse...
depraved... flat out gross!

41
00:03:51,791 --> 00:03:53,500
So, how do we
pick our new seats?

42
00:03:53,583 --> 00:03:55,000
We could draw
straws or somethin'.

43
00:03:55,083 --> 00:03:57,666
Great idea! And since
Cayenne and Shrade are out,

44
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:00,208
I volunteer to draw for them!

45
00:04:14,791 --> 00:04:17,541
Okey-doke. Grab a good
one, between two hotties,

46
00:04:17,625 --> 00:04:20,750
and you're the meat in a sexy
sandwich for the semester!

47
00:04:24,708 --> 00:04:26,833
Nice to meet you. I'm Malloy.

48
00:04:26,916 --> 00:04:28,916
You were in the
mock battle, huh?

49
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,250
Nice to meet you! I'm Ei.

50
00:04:31,833 --> 00:04:32,791
Pleased to meet you.

51
00:04:32,875 --> 00:04:34,041
The pleasure's all mine!

52
00:04:34,125 --> 00:04:37,750
Ah, why me, man? Lame.

53
00:04:39,458 --> 00:04:42,583
Of all the degenerates to
get stuck sitting next to...

54
00:04:43,708 --> 00:04:45,291
Nice profile.

55
00:04:47,958 --> 00:04:49,833
Really?

56
00:04:49,916 --> 00:04:51,125
Great seats, don't you think?

57
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:52,958
Uh, I guess so, yeah.

58
00:04:53,041 --> 00:04:56,791
Yoo hoo! Doesn't it feel
like a sauna in here?

59
00:04:56,875 --> 00:05:00,333
Or is it from
sitting so close to you?

60
00:05:02,375 --> 00:05:04,333
It's a bit warm.

61
00:05:04,416 --> 00:05:05,916
Amata!

62
00:05:11,666 --> 00:05:14,958
Studly Cayenne and lovely Shrade
sitting right in front of me.

63
00:05:15,041 --> 00:05:17,958
Looks like Christmas came
early for you, Sazanka.

64
00:05:18,041 --> 00:05:21,041
Oh! It's just too much!
I can't take it!

65
00:05:23,375 --> 00:05:25,791
This is the first time we've
sat beside each other, right?

66
00:05:25,875 --> 00:05:27,375
Yeah? It'll be the last.

67
00:05:27,458 --> 00:05:30,583
Thank you for coming to
retrieve me. I'm flattered.

68
00:05:30,666 --> 00:05:32,541
I'm only in town for business.

69
00:05:32,625 --> 00:05:34,958
I happened to be out doing
recon up the road, so--

70
00:05:35,041 --> 00:05:36,250
Eyes front.

71
00:05:39,625 --> 00:05:43,000
Oh dear, your timbre
is a bit discordant.

72
00:05:43,083 --> 00:05:44,625
Shut up!

73
00:05:45,375 --> 00:05:47,916
It was a joke, my friend.

74
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:55,583
Damn it. Everyone else is
having the time of their lives.

75
00:05:55,666 --> 00:05:57,458
And here I am,

76
00:05:57,541 --> 00:06:02,458
stuck with Mr. Toad's wild
handkerchief cat-doll thingy.

77
00:06:02,541 --> 00:06:05,416
Wait a second. Bingo!

78
00:06:06,291 --> 00:06:09,833
Look out! It's a
Tadpole-tergeist!

79
00:06:09,916 --> 00:06:10,875
What?

80
00:06:10,958 --> 00:06:12,166
What's going on?

81
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:14,083
What you mean that frog thing?

82
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:16,041
Have you heard?

83
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:17,291
There's a story of an Element

84
00:06:17,375 --> 00:06:19,375
who disappeared
here at Neo-DEAVA.

85
00:06:19,458 --> 00:06:21,125
You serious?

86
00:06:21,208 --> 00:06:24,416
They say it happened
a few years ago.

87
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:27,375
A new girl arrived
here at the Academy,

88
00:06:27,458 --> 00:06:29,916
but this Element was so timid,

89
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,791
so shy, she never
made a single friend.

90
00:06:35,083 --> 00:06:37,208
Until the fateful day,

91
00:06:37,291 --> 00:06:39,958
crushed by the weight
of her solitude,

92
00:06:40,041 --> 00:06:43,458
she vanished, leaving
nothing but the doll.

93
00:06:45,958 --> 00:06:47,541
That's just unreal.

94
00:06:47,625 --> 00:06:49,875
That's just so sad.

95
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:54,333
The poor thing had only
one true friend, her plushie.

96
00:06:54,416 --> 00:06:57,125
They say the doll appears
late at night, alone,

97
00:06:57,208 --> 00:07:00,791
wandering aimlessly
through the campus halls.

98
00:07:00,875 --> 00:07:03,541
And if you listen, you may
hear the lost girl's sad,

99
00:07:03,625 --> 00:07:08,958
lonely voice, singing her tragic
song in the glowing starlight.

100
00:07:09,041 --> 00:07:10,625
You sound like an idiot.

101
00:07:10,708 --> 00:07:13,541
No really, Andy knows
what he's talking about.

102
00:07:13,625 --> 00:07:15,458
The doll's been seen
in the guy's dorm,

103
00:07:15,541 --> 00:07:17,125
pretty much since
the Berlin fell.

104
00:07:17,208 --> 00:07:19,333
Oh gosh, Malloy believes it too.

105
00:07:19,416 --> 00:07:20,791
It must be true.

106
00:07:20,875 --> 00:07:22,791
No, I'm scared!

107
00:07:24,666 --> 00:07:26,958
The whiskered
frog-demon just moved!

108
00:07:27,041 --> 00:07:28,166
Andy...

109
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:30,041
Would you just drop
the act for a minute?

110
00:07:30,125 --> 00:07:34,125
Drop what act?
I'm telling you, I saw it move!

111
00:07:47,875 --> 00:07:49,958
Mission complete.

112
00:07:50,333 --> 00:07:52,125
Excellent work, Jin.

113
00:07:52,208 --> 00:07:53,500
Thank you.

114
00:07:53,583 --> 00:07:57,458
But real combat is less
forgiving than a simulation.

115
00:07:57,541 --> 00:07:59,166
Remember that.

116
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:00,583
And Kagura?

117
00:08:00,666 --> 00:08:04,083
That upstart has been
grounded, for the time being.

118
00:08:04,166 --> 00:08:07,666
An invisible door,
a passage to the future,

119
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:10,791
a gateway to the
end of the world.

120
00:08:12,958 --> 00:08:14,833
Time for a closer look.

121
00:08:14,916 --> 00:08:16,750
I'll knock on the door again.

122
00:08:16,833 --> 00:08:21,291
So be it. Make us proud,
Last Son of Altair.

123
00:08:33,875 --> 00:08:35,750
Finally finished.

124
00:08:39,833 --> 00:08:42,416
Hey there. What's up?
You're out late.

125
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:43,666
Hey, get stuck cleaning?

126
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:44,916
Man, what a rip-off.

127
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,041
Yup, I'm about to
head back though.

128
00:08:47,125 --> 00:08:49,583
Oh, is that a fact? What luck!

129
00:08:49,666 --> 00:08:53,041
I'm heading to the dorms too!

130
00:08:53,125 --> 00:08:55,041
Maybe you could walk with me?

131
00:08:55,125 --> 00:08:57,166
Don't be afraid, tough guy!

132
00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:59,750
We can watch each other's backs!

133
00:09:09,666 --> 00:09:10,875
Crap.

134
00:09:10,958 --> 00:09:13,083
Oh, no, are we locked out?

135
00:09:13,166 --> 00:09:15,041
Yeah, we're not
getting in this way.

136
00:09:15,125 --> 00:09:17,750
Oh well, we're headin'
different places anyhow.

137
00:09:17,833 --> 00:09:18,666
G'night.

138
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:20,833
Hey wait!

139
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:23,166
What?

140
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:26,041
Why don't you come
in from the girl's side?

141
00:09:26,125 --> 00:09:29,750
Umm, ok. Why exactly?

142
00:09:42,833 --> 00:09:47,208
Zessica! Y'know, it's kinda
hard to walk like this.

143
00:09:47,291 --> 00:09:49,208
Right, sorry.

144
00:09:49,875 --> 00:09:53,625
Okay, what's the problem?
Are you scared?

145
00:09:53,708 --> 00:09:56,916
That's so dumb!
No way in hell, buster!

146
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I-I ain't afraid of no ghosts,

147
00:09:59,083 --> 00:10:01,666
or some stupid
moving dolls, or...

148
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:03,875
They're-- They're not even real!

149
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:06,416
Wuzzat?

150
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:11,250
That weird frog-cat.

151
00:10:11,333 --> 00:10:13,625
Wait. What is that
thing doing here?

152
00:10:15,208 --> 00:10:21,875
Meow meow meow meow
meow meow meow meow...

153
00:10:23,166 --> 00:10:25,833
No way! It's gotta
be a practical joke.

154
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:28,750
Real funny. It--
it was just a story!

155
00:11:03,541 --> 00:11:06,166
You stink like carrion.

156
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:11,291
I was scared, but
that wasn't all I felt.

157
00:11:11,375 --> 00:11:14,583
It was almost like
I already knew him.

158
00:11:16,541 --> 00:11:18,833
What do you think, Shush?

159
00:11:22,708 --> 00:11:24,333
Stop grabbing me there!

160
00:11:24,416 --> 00:11:25,875
Please don't leave me!

161
00:11:28,666 --> 00:11:32,500
No, not Amata and Zessica.

162
00:11:37,166 --> 00:11:38,541
Come back bastard!

163
00:11:38,625 --> 00:11:40,583
The stinky wench is mine!

164
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:43,041
Keep your hands off her!

165
00:11:44,708 --> 00:11:46,458
Can it be done?

166
00:11:46,541 --> 00:11:51,208
Can the Last Son of Altair
lead us to redemption?

167
00:11:55,833 --> 00:11:57,458
No, really, I saw it!

168
00:11:57,541 --> 00:11:59,250
What, the ghost-plushie?

169
00:11:59,333 --> 00:12:01,750
Yeah, wandering around in
the middle of the night!

170
00:12:01,833 --> 00:12:03,083
Amata, saw it too.

171
00:12:03,166 --> 00:12:04,916
Without a doubt.

172
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,875
C'mon man, it was all a joke.

173
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:08,416
Did you think I was serious?

174
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,541
Dude, it did everything
just like in your story.

175
00:12:10,625 --> 00:12:12,375
It was totally walking around!

176
00:12:12,458 --> 00:12:13,833
I even heard it sing.

177
00:12:13,916 --> 00:12:15,208
Sh'yeah, right.

178
00:12:15,291 --> 00:12:17,333
It's so cute, the things kids
convince themselves

179
00:12:17,416 --> 00:12:18,416
of at this age.

180
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:20,333
You're the same
age as us, douche bag.

181
00:12:20,416 --> 00:12:22,291
I have a pressing query.

182
00:12:22,375 --> 00:12:25,833
That is... What were you
two doing together last night?

183
00:12:25,916 --> 00:12:28,000
Uh, well Zessica--

184
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:30,583
Hey? What the--?

185
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:32,250
Please don't tell
them I was scared.

186
00:12:32,333 --> 00:12:34,875
I get enough flack
for the way I dress.

187
00:12:35,666 --> 00:12:37,166
Um, what are you
two whispering for?

188
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:38,791
I-- we-- uh...

189
00:12:38,875 --> 00:12:42,083
Why do you refuse to
answer me? You perverts!

190
00:12:42,166 --> 00:12:45,250
If you sowed your wild oats on
Academy grounds, so help me--

191
00:12:45,333 --> 00:12:46,250
Sowed my what now?

192
00:12:46,333 --> 00:12:48,750
I saw it too!

193
00:12:48,833 --> 00:12:51,916
You saw the doll walking?
Was it gaining on us?

194
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,333
But what I did see
was Zess and Amata

195
00:12:55,416 --> 00:12:56,791
running through the courtyard...

196
00:12:56,875 --> 00:12:58,375
in each other's arms!

197
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:02,791
Then she screamed out,
"Please don't leave me!"

198
00:13:03,833 --> 00:13:06,041
So they were having
a lover's quarrel?

199
00:13:06,125 --> 00:13:08,000
Ah-ha! I knew it!

200
00:13:08,083 --> 00:13:10,083
You got it all wrong!

201
00:13:10,166 --> 00:13:12,333
Listen, Mikono, it was a--

202
00:13:12,916 --> 00:13:15,166
Abductors detected in the
Neo-Kowloon area.

203
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:16,416
All Elements are to report

204
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,833
to phase one battle
stations immediately.

205
00:13:18,916 --> 00:13:22,833
Repeat, all Elements to phase
one battle stations immediately!

206
00:13:28,416 --> 00:13:30,833
Analysis complete. Pattern B.

207
00:13:30,916 --> 00:13:33,958
Exactly like the simulation.

208
00:13:34,041 --> 00:13:36,833
The Abductor has destroyed
our exterior fortifications!

209
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:38,875
Speed clocked at 60kph!

210
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:40,333
Well that's odd.

211
00:13:40,416 --> 00:13:43,000
It isn't attempting
a single capture.

212
00:13:43,083 --> 00:13:44,708
That thing's done enough damage.

213
00:13:44,791 --> 00:13:46,750
Zessica. You're the
head this time.

214
00:13:46,833 --> 00:13:48,000
Roger!

215
00:13:48,083 --> 00:13:50,208
Awright, Cayenne,
Amata. Get going!

216
00:13:50,291 --> 00:13:52,041
Roger!

217
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:03,291
Mikono, I- I'm so
sorry I let you down.

218
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:05,375
The enemy's capabilities
are still unknown.

219
00:14:05,458 --> 00:14:08,541
Laser range uncalculated.
So be careful out there.

220
00:14:08,625 --> 00:14:09,958
Yes, sir!

221
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:12,791
We've been ambushed!

222
00:14:12,875 --> 00:14:14,750
Y'think? Where's it coming from?

223
00:14:14,833 --> 00:14:16,833
It's aim. It's nearly flawless!

224
00:14:16,916 --> 00:14:18,208
But how?

225
00:14:18,291 --> 00:14:20,625
No one can aim a laser
with that kind of accuracy,

226
00:14:20,708 --> 00:14:22,666
much less in an atmosphere.

227
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:24,791
The Radius Gnis.

228
00:14:24,875 --> 00:14:26,541
Zen?

229
00:14:26,625 --> 00:14:29,833
He can spot a coin from
a thousand villages away,

230
00:14:29,916 --> 00:14:34,958
loose a perfect arrow, piercing
straight through to its mark!

231
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:38,583
How do you know that?

232
00:14:38,666 --> 00:14:40,625
One has but to look.

233
00:14:42,666 --> 00:14:43,833
Merge right now!

234
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:46,125
One hit from that thing,
and your Vector's done.

235
00:14:46,208 --> 00:14:49,250
Fly low and close distance!

236
00:14:49,333 --> 00:14:53,125
Emergency merge! Go! Aquarion!

237
00:14:59,458 --> 00:15:01,625
Aquarion Gepard!

238
00:15:07,208 --> 00:15:08,500
That area is clear.

239
00:15:08,583 --> 00:15:10,041
Collateral damage is expected,

240
00:15:10,125 --> 00:15:11,541
so use those
buildings for cover!

241
00:15:11,625 --> 00:15:12,875
Roger!

242
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:15,208
The enemy is too far out
of range for our weapons!

243
00:15:15,291 --> 00:15:16,916
But there's only one
of them out there,

244
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,708
and we'll close in under cover.

245
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,875
I can read you like a book.

246
00:15:27,958 --> 00:15:32,000
I'll pin you down, and cut you
to ribbons in the crossfire.

247
00:15:34,583 --> 00:15:36,833
Alert! Incoming
enemy projectiles!

248
00:15:36,916 --> 00:15:38,416
Missiles, or...?

249
00:15:39,166 --> 00:15:40,541
What're those?

250
00:15:46,875 --> 00:15:48,291
No way!

251
00:15:50,166 --> 00:15:52,833
Son of a bitch!
Where'd that come from?

252
00:15:56,458 --> 00:15:59,291
Those projectiles are being
used to reflect the lasers.

253
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:02,625
The enemy could attack
Aquarion from any direction!

254
00:16:02,708 --> 00:16:04,375
Very unfortunate.

255
00:16:04,458 --> 00:16:08,041
It would seem taking
cover is useless.

256
00:16:13,833 --> 00:16:16,916
It's like we're being shot at
by an entire freakin' army!

257
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,500
Zessica! Look out!

258
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:24,750
Amata!

259
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:30,375
Vector Z is taking
the brunt of the fire!

260
00:16:30,458 --> 00:16:32,500
Amata's aura is dropping fast!

261
00:16:32,583 --> 00:16:33,708
Just hold on!

262
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:36,291
It's hit the limit!
Vector Merge breaking!

263
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:43,458
Amata!

264
00:16:43,541 --> 00:16:44,916
This is my fault!

265
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,333
I'm not even a
fraction of the pilot

266
00:16:46,416 --> 00:16:48,541
I should be to handle Aquarion!

267
00:16:48,625 --> 00:16:50,583
Zessica's aura
is falling fast, sir!

268
00:16:50,666 --> 00:16:53,250
Under 40 percent...
30 percent...

269
00:16:53,333 --> 00:16:56,416
But Amata's the one
taking the damage!

270
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:58,375
Zessica...

271
00:16:58,458 --> 00:17:01,958
A person's heart cannot
be seen with eyes alone.

272
00:17:02,041 --> 00:17:06,041
Misunderstanding drives a
wedge between the best of us.

273
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:08,625
But, remember this, child:

274
00:17:08,708 --> 00:17:11,041
whether we turn a blind
eye to the fact or not,

275
00:17:11,125 --> 00:17:13,458
all things have their place.

276
00:17:14,625 --> 00:17:18,041
Now we shall find strength in
the things that remain unseen!

277
00:17:18,125 --> 00:17:20,000
Element Change!

278
00:17:20,083 --> 00:17:24,708
Replace Zessica Wong
with Yunoha Suroor!

279
00:17:24,791 --> 00:17:25,708
Yunoha?

280
00:17:25,791 --> 00:17:27,250
Who's that?

281
00:17:38,958 --> 00:17:39,583
What?!

282
00:17:39,666 --> 00:17:41,208
Is that a freakin' doll?

283
00:17:41,291 --> 00:17:43,833
Hi Amata, nice to see you again!

284
00:17:43,916 --> 00:17:45,750
It can talk?

285
00:17:47,958 --> 00:17:52,666
Amata, Zessica, I'm very sorry
I frightened you last night,

286
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:54,791
and I'm sorry I let
Mikono misunderstand

287
00:17:54,875 --> 00:17:57,041
what really happened.

288
00:17:57,125 --> 00:17:59,291
Honest mistake.

289
00:17:59,375 --> 00:18:00,791
If you saw that frog thing

290
00:18:00,875 --> 00:18:03,500
in the middle of the night,
you'd probably lose it too.

291
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:05,125
I really am sorry.

292
00:18:05,208 --> 00:18:07,791
But please guys,
you have to trust me.

293
00:18:07,875 --> 00:18:09,458
Let me fight by your side!

294
00:18:09,541 --> 00:18:12,041
Then you're the
missing Element, huh?

295
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:15,708
Can we save the
formalities for later?

296
00:18:15,791 --> 00:18:18,541
Amata, I know
I scared you before,

297
00:18:18,625 --> 00:18:20,291
but will you Merge with me?

298
00:18:20,375 --> 00:18:23,500
Let's do it. I believe in you.

299
00:18:23,583 --> 00:18:29,125
Trans-Spectral Merge!
Go! Aquarion!

300
00:18:41,708 --> 00:18:43,458
No! They'll see me!

301
00:18:43,541 --> 00:18:45,625
They'll see all of me!

302
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:48,541
Whoa, I can see her!
I really see her!

303
00:18:48,625 --> 00:18:51,250
Yunoha. I see the real you!

304
00:18:52,833 --> 00:18:58,333
No. I don't want to be seen,
but it feels so nice.

305
00:19:00,208 --> 00:19:02,583
Aquarion Evol!

306
00:19:03,708 --> 00:19:06,291
The Machine Angel
gets a new dress,

307
00:19:06,375 --> 00:19:09,166
which was also covered
in the simulation.

308
00:19:10,708 --> 00:19:12,291
Holy crap, she's real!

309
00:19:12,375 --> 00:19:14,166
The freaky ghost-frog
girl is real!

310
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:15,708
And, man, she's kinda cute!

311
00:19:15,791 --> 00:19:19,291
Stop it! You're making
me blush, I'm gonna...

312
00:19:25,541 --> 00:19:26,458
I missed?

313
00:19:26,541 --> 00:19:27,375
What the--?!

314
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:29,500
Aquarion just vanished!

315
00:19:31,375 --> 00:19:34,333
The lasers went
right through us!

316
00:19:34,416 --> 00:19:37,583
Her shyness fully
envelops her, like a shroud,

317
00:19:37,666 --> 00:19:40,583
but it also makes her
transparent to sources of light.

318
00:19:40,666 --> 00:19:44,875
Behold Yunoha Suroor's
Elemental power.

319
00:19:46,125 --> 00:19:48,833
Like gossamer cereus
blooming in the night,

320
00:19:48,916 --> 00:19:50,875
so too blooms Yunoha.

321
00:19:50,958 --> 00:19:52,375
We should be careful;

322
00:19:52,458 --> 00:19:55,708
I can't keep Aquarion
transparent the whole time.

323
00:19:55,791 --> 00:19:57,250
I'm just not strong enough.

324
00:19:57,333 --> 00:19:58,875
We'll work with
what you give us!

325
00:19:58,958 --> 00:20:00,583
Your power's awesome, Yunoha!

326
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:02,083
If you keep complimenting me,

327
00:20:02,166 --> 00:20:05,458
I'll get shy,
and when I get shy, I...

328
00:20:10,708 --> 00:20:12,208
My lasers don't even touch it!

329
00:20:12,291 --> 00:20:14,875
Okay, this was never
covered in the damn sim!

330
00:20:22,541 --> 00:20:25,916
Distance 800. Now close
in and let's drop this guy!

331
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,416
Right!

332
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,250
Oh, I see, you're only
invisible to light waves.

333
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:36,916
I can't see you,
but I know you're there.

334
00:20:38,333 --> 00:20:40,625
Lasers don't work,
but bullets will!

335
00:20:44,875 --> 00:20:46,041
Did I get it?

336
00:20:58,333 --> 00:21:01,666
Okay, yeah. This is
getting a little ridiculous.

337
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:03,208
Do it now!

338
00:21:03,291 --> 00:21:05,666
All right, hit him
with the Fist Unseen!

339
00:21:07,375 --> 00:21:11,291
Subliminal Punch!

340
00:21:16,291 --> 00:21:18,000
We-- we got him!

341
00:21:20,041 --> 00:21:21,041
They won!

342
00:21:21,125 --> 00:21:23,750
Did the ghost girl do that?

343
00:21:34,166 --> 00:21:36,208
The Trans-dimensional
Remote Control.

344
00:21:36,291 --> 00:21:38,250
Good luck with that.

345
00:21:38,916 --> 00:21:40,125
Well, at least I got to see

346
00:21:40,208 --> 00:21:45,333
a new Rare Igura,
before she turned invisible.

347
00:21:50,791 --> 00:21:51,666
Amata!

348
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:52,708
Mikono, hey!

349
00:21:52,791 --> 00:21:54,500
Zessica told me what
really happened.

350
00:21:54,583 --> 00:21:58,500
I guess I jumped to
conclusions. I am so sorry!

351
00:21:58,583 --> 00:22:00,625
Don't worry about it.

352
00:22:02,291 --> 00:22:04,875
Oh! Yeah, meet our new teammate!

353
00:22:04,958 --> 00:22:07,041
Hello, my name's Yunoha.

354
00:22:07,125 --> 00:22:08,875
So, you're the ghost
of that Element

355
00:22:08,958 --> 00:22:10,541
who vanished back in
the day, is that right?

356
00:22:10,625 --> 00:22:11,333
Huh?

357
00:22:11,416 --> 00:22:12,416
But don't you worry.

358
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:14,083
I'm not afraid of you anymore,

359
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:17,041
'cause we're totally
comrades in arms now.

360
00:22:17,125 --> 00:22:18,500
Now wait just a second.

361
00:22:18,583 --> 00:22:21,083
What are you talking about,
Amata. What ghost?

362
00:22:21,166 --> 00:22:25,208
Umm, there seems to be some
kind of misunderstanding.

363
00:22:25,291 --> 00:22:28,541
Sorry, but-- but I'm alive.

364
00:22:29,583 --> 00:22:31,583
That's Yunoha Suroor,

365
00:22:31,666 --> 00:22:35,083
she's a vector pilot,
just like all of you are.

366
00:22:35,166 --> 00:22:42,166
I'm sorry! Not again.
Let me down!

367
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:44,583
Oh jeez, poor Amata.

368
00:22:44,666 --> 00:22:47,541
He'll fly for just
anyone, won't he?

369
00:24:23,125 --> 00:24:24,166
My name's Zessica Wong.

370
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:26,125
I'm pretty famous
for a 17 year old,

371
00:24:26,208 --> 00:24:28,625
mostly for how much
skin I usually show.

372
00:24:28,708 --> 00:24:29,916
Well, the depths of my cleavage

373
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,375
may be open for all
to see, but my heart?

374
00:24:32,458 --> 00:24:33,583
Off limits.

375
00:24:33,666 --> 00:24:36,250
Next time on Aquarion Evol:
"Revelations."
