1
00:00:20,916 --> 00:00:21,958
[AMATA] Well at least...

2
00:00:22,041 --> 00:00:24,958
I finally have some
sense of closure.

3
00:00:31,458 --> 00:00:33,750
[AMATA] How long has it been...?

4
00:00:33,833 --> 00:00:36,000
Since I've really known peace?

5
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:49,625
[AMATA] But just
like everything else...

6
00:01:34,416 --> 00:01:36,500
[AMATA] Kagura!!

7
00:01:40,625 --> 00:01:41,958
[AMATA] I swear on my life...

8
00:01:42,041 --> 00:01:44,708
You will pay for
what you've done!

9
00:03:23,083 --> 00:03:27,666
[KAGURA] Izumo...
You son of a bitch... Silvie!

10
00:03:31,333 --> 00:03:32,500
[KAGURA] Dammit all...

11
00:03:32,583 --> 00:03:35,041
Wherever you've gone,
I'm coming for you...

12
00:03:35,125 --> 00:03:38,125
You are no one's
fetid bitch but mine!

13
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,958
[KAGURA] I'll watch the world
burn before I let you go!

14
00:03:51,208 --> 00:03:52,083
[KAGURA] What?

15
00:03:53,375 --> 00:03:54,958
[KAGURA] Holy shit!

16
00:03:55,041 --> 00:03:57,166
[AMATA] That's right,
you prick...

17
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:59,250
I'm your grim reaper.

18
00:03:59,333 --> 00:04:02,125
So, if you got any last words...

19
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:04,625
You better spit 'em out now!

20
00:04:16,958 --> 00:04:18,583
[KAGURA] How the hell
is this happening?!

21
00:04:18,666 --> 00:04:21,583
Why am I hearing his voice?!

22
00:04:21,666 --> 00:04:23,875
[AMATA] Why do you think?!

23
00:04:23,958 --> 00:04:26,000
[AMATA] We're not just
from the same womb...

24
00:04:26,083 --> 00:04:28,333
We're two halves of
the same damn soul...!

25
00:04:28,416 --> 00:04:30,875
You're my responsibility...

26
00:04:30,958 --> 00:04:32,791
I have to make you suffer!

27
00:04:32,875 --> 00:04:34,375
[KAGURA] Okay...

28
00:04:34,458 --> 00:04:36,875
[AMATA] You murdered our father
you psychotic son of a bitch!

29
00:04:36,958 --> 00:04:39,333
[KAGURA] Our Father...?
The hell?!

30
00:04:39,416 --> 00:04:43,000
[AMATA] The High
Commander of Altair! Izumo!

31
00:04:46,833 --> 00:04:48,666
[AMATA] You deserve to die!

32
00:04:50,208 --> 00:04:53,250
[AMATA] You've destroyed
everything I've ever had!

33
00:05:02,375 --> 00:05:04,708
[KAGURA] You never
stop whining, do you?

34
00:05:05,916 --> 00:05:08,875
[KAGURA] Flying that piece
of shit doesn't make you god.

35
00:05:08,958 --> 00:05:10,500
'Cause heads-up, asshole:

36
00:05:10,583 --> 00:05:11,583
[KAGURA] Anything you can do,

37
00:05:11,666 --> 00:05:13,958
I can do without
squealing like a bitch.

38
00:05:20,833 --> 00:05:22,916
[AMATA] You will not get away!

39
00:05:31,583 --> 00:05:32,666
[AMATA] What?!

40
00:05:37,916 --> 00:05:39,833
[KAGURA] Oh-ho... It's on!

41
00:05:59,708 --> 00:06:04,083
[ZESSICA] Two jagged
pieces of a soul divided.

42
00:06:04,166 --> 00:06:07,833
[ZESSICA] Two fraught members
of Solar Wing combining.

43
00:06:08,916 --> 00:06:11,166
[MIKAGE] Vermillion dreams...

44
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:15,166
crashing 'gainst the
indigo shores of reality.

45
00:06:54,583 --> 00:06:56,416
[surprised gasps]

46
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:59,625
[SUOMI] What in heaven's
name...?! Chairwoman!

47
00:07:00,041 --> 00:07:04,083
[DONAR] Can't be... Surely
it's some kind of trick...

48
00:07:04,166 --> 00:07:06,000
[CREA] Planet Altair.

49
00:07:06,083 --> 00:07:07,916
[CIERRO] We've got somethin'
strange goin' on...

50
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,583
The Abductor...?
It's merged with Gepard!

51
00:07:10,666 --> 00:07:12,625
[SUOMI] They merged?

52
00:07:12,708 --> 00:07:14,083
[DONAR] What?

53
00:07:16,916 --> 00:07:18,041
[ANDY] Mix!

54
00:07:23,708 --> 00:07:26,041
[ANDY] Stop fighting
and let me in, please!

55
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,708
[MIX] Spatial Augmentation!

56
00:07:30,541 --> 00:07:31,500
[CAYENNE] Get a grip!.

57
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:32,875
You're not gonna
get through to her!

58
00:07:32,958 --> 00:07:34,041
[MALLOY] If you wanna die dude,

59
00:07:34,125 --> 00:07:35,958
by all means,
keep using up your power!

60
00:07:36,041 --> 00:07:37,125
[ANDY] If you think
I'm leaving her behind

61
00:07:37,208 --> 00:07:39,041
you're out of
your friggin' mind...!

62
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:41,208
My place is here.

63
00:07:41,291 --> 00:07:43,333
[ANDY] I'm not callin' it quits

64
00:07:43,416 --> 00:07:46,125
until I'm holding
Mix in my arms!

65
00:07:48,708 --> 00:07:49,833
[ANDY] Mix, I'm here!

66
00:07:57,333 --> 00:07:58,958
[ANDY] Take my hand!

67
00:07:59,041 --> 00:07:59,958
[MIX] Damn you...

68
00:08:00,041 --> 00:08:02,625
Why can't you just leave me be?

69
00:08:03,125 --> 00:08:05,083
[ANDY] Let me fill your hole.

70
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,208
[MIX] No! Holes
are disgusting...!

71
00:08:10,291 --> 00:08:13,375
Get away from meeeee!

72
00:08:13,791 --> 00:08:14,916
[ANDY] Listen--!

73
00:08:16,208 --> 00:08:17,875
[CAYENNE] Andy, no!

74
00:08:21,625 --> 00:08:23,333
[CAYENNE] Get the hell
out of there, Andy!

75
00:08:23,416 --> 00:08:25,125
[MALLOY] She's gonna
slice you in half, man!

76
00:08:26,958 --> 00:08:31,125
[ANDY] I am not...
leaving her. Y'hear me...?!

77
00:08:31,208 --> 00:08:34,666
Damn it Mix, it's my job to
fill the hole in your heart...!

78
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:38,541
You and I...
belong... together...

79
00:08:38,625 --> 00:08:41,000
[MIX] That phrase...
sounds so familiar...

80
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:50,541
[ANDY] Let me save you, Mix!

81
00:09:12,125 --> 00:09:13,666
[ANDY] 'Kay, I gotcha...

82
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:15,958
You're exactly where
you belong now.

83
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:20,125
My love... My Mix.

84
00:09:24,375 --> 00:09:25,500
[MIX] It's like...

85
00:09:25,583 --> 00:09:29,166
something's bridging
the gaps in my memory.

86
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:36,166
[MIX] Patching up the
holes... No, not quite...

87
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:39,750
[MIX] More like...
filling them in.

88
00:09:48,208 --> 00:09:49,708
[MIX] Andy!

89
00:09:58,125 --> 00:09:59,791
[ANDY] Mix...? Is it you?

90
00:09:59,875 --> 00:10:01,625
[MIX] Oh Andy...

91
00:10:01,708 --> 00:10:04,416
[ANDY] So... So you
remember who I am?

92
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:08,166
[MIX] I do, finally...
You're... You're my Andy!

93
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:10,166
[ANDY] Mix...! This is--

94
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:12,250
[MIX] Nooooo!

95
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:15,041
[MIX] I look awful!

96
00:10:15,125 --> 00:10:17,666
[MIX] Just turn
away or something.

97
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:20,125
I don't want you
to see me like this.

98
00:10:20,208 --> 00:10:21,541
[ANDY] Seriously?

99
00:10:21,625 --> 00:10:25,875
[MIX] On Altair...
They changed me, Andy!

100
00:10:30,291 --> 00:10:33,083
[ANDY] Far as I'm concerned,
you're the same.

101
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:35,125
[ANDY] I don't give
a damn whatcha got

102
00:10:35,208 --> 00:10:36,708
goin' on on the outside...

103
00:10:36,791 --> 00:10:40,583
Boy or girl, you're still the
one I fell head over heels for.

104
00:10:41,916 --> 00:10:43,083
[MIX] You mean it?

105
00:10:45,708 --> 00:10:48,958
[ANDY] C'mon... Let's merge.

106
00:10:49,041 --> 00:10:51,791
[MIX] Yeah okay.

107
00:10:52,666 --> 00:10:54,125
[ANDY] Only if you're ready.

108
00:10:54,208 --> 00:10:55,333
[MIX] I am.

109
00:10:55,416 --> 00:10:56,916
[MALLOY] Dude, are you
gonna do this here?!

110
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,333
[CAYENNE] Damn it Hall,
focus on what we need to do!

111
00:11:00,833 --> 00:11:01,833
[ANDY] I've been saving myself

112
00:11:01,916 --> 00:11:04,000
for this like a puritan
for marriage...

113
00:11:04,083 --> 00:11:05,541
Let's do this right, huh...?

114
00:11:05,625 --> 00:11:08,041
Give 'em a little somethin'
to write home about!

115
00:11:09,166 --> 00:11:10,541
[ANDY] Long-Awaited Merge...

116
00:11:10,625 --> 00:11:11,583
[MIX] Go...!

117
00:11:11,666 --> 00:11:14,083
[TOGETHER] Aquarion!

118
00:11:16,333 --> 00:11:18,583
[YUNOHA] I know,
my timing kinda stinks.

119
00:11:25,416 --> 00:11:27,500
[CREA] A hero's
welcome is in order...

120
00:11:27,583 --> 00:11:30,000
For the pair of you, I think.

121
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:33,666
[AMATA] You had
everything, Kagura!

122
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:35,250
You had mom and dad!

123
00:11:35,333 --> 00:11:39,000
I was left to rot on Vega!
I had nothing!

124
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:42,458
[AMATA] You've pissed away more
than I've ever asked for!

125
00:11:42,541 --> 00:11:45,708
So tell me how
that's fair... Tell me!

126
00:11:49,666 --> 00:11:51,916
[KAGURA] You think I had a
silver spoon, jackass...?!

127
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,625
I meant nothing to mom and dad!

128
00:11:53,708 --> 00:11:54,833
[AMATA] Liar!

129
00:11:54,916 --> 00:11:57,333
[KAGURA] I spent my
childhood as a slave...!

130
00:11:57,416 --> 00:12:00,000
Our parents pawned
me off on Mikage!

131
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,708
[KAGURA] You can't even imagine
what life with him was like...

132
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:09,875
[KAGURA] I'd have
been better off fending

133
00:12:09,958 --> 00:12:12,208
for myself on the streets...

134
00:12:12,291 --> 00:12:15,291
Hell, I'd have been better off
dead!

135
00:12:19,375 --> 00:12:22,083
[KAGURA] D'you know
what it is to be tortured...?

136
00:12:22,166 --> 00:12:24,958
Or worse... To spend
your whole life oblivious,

137
00:12:25,041 --> 00:12:28,250
just to have the scent of
a stranger wake you up

138
00:12:28,333 --> 00:12:29,833
from that nightmare...?

139
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:32,916
That's what she is
to me: salvation...!

140
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,250
Without her, I'm a husk!

141
00:12:35,333 --> 00:12:37,208
[KAGURA] She has to die...

142
00:12:37,291 --> 00:12:39,625
We have to die together...

143
00:12:39,708 --> 00:12:41,833
And if our piss-poor
excuse for a dad

144
00:12:41,916 --> 00:12:44,125
had to bite it along
the way, then tough!

145
00:12:44,208 --> 00:12:45,750
[AMATA] I'll kill you!

146
00:12:45,833 --> 00:12:49,000
[KAGURA] Even if you could,
you don't have the balls!

147
00:12:55,333 --> 00:12:56,416
[KAGURA] You're the weak half...

148
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,708
You don't know how to love!

149
00:12:58,791 --> 00:13:00,375
[KAGURA] Everything
twelve thousand years ago

150
00:13:00,458 --> 00:13:01,958
was your fault...!

151
00:13:02,041 --> 00:13:05,375
You're the reason we got torn
away from Silvie to begin with!

152
00:13:05,458 --> 00:13:06,750
[AMATA] Shut up!

153
00:13:06,833 --> 00:13:08,166
[KAGURA] History's a circle...

154
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:11,333
Look at yourself: you
couldn't even hold on to mom!

155
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:13,250
[AMATA] Shut up! Shut up--!

156
00:13:13,333 --> 00:13:15,416
[KAGURA] What chance
does Silvie have with you?!

157
00:13:15,833 --> 00:13:18,541
[AMATA] I said... shut up!!!!

158
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:22,416
[AMATA] Die!!!

159
00:13:31,375 --> 00:13:32,750
[EI] Altair's on a
collision course...

160
00:13:32,833 --> 00:13:34,750
We're dead in its path!

161
00:13:35,541 --> 00:13:36,958
[SUOMI] It's as though
the planets are following

162
00:13:37,041 --> 00:13:40,166
the spiritual trajectory of
Amata and Kagura's fight...

163
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:41,708
Chairwoman?

164
00:13:45,916 --> 00:13:49,166
[FUDO] So fills a blank page
in the Book of Twin Stars.

165
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:51,041
The fate of worlds at stake.

166
00:13:51,125 --> 00:13:54,375
[FUDO] Twin fragments
of the selfsame essence

167
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:56,166
hail to one another...

168
00:13:56,250 --> 00:14:01,208
Two planets advance...
inexorably toward destruction.

169
00:14:01,291 --> 00:14:04,416
[FUDO] Thus is the
past shed like a carapace

170
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:07,208
and the future woven
by ineffable sacrifice.

171
00:14:07,291 --> 00:14:11,333
[FUDO] Thus Mikage
reigns as a god.

172
00:14:11,416 --> 00:14:13,833
[CREA] Not the epilogue you
hoped for, I suspect.

173
00:14:15,791 --> 00:14:17,208
[CREA] You've watched
this tale unfold

174
00:14:17,291 --> 00:14:19,250
from a clarifying distance...

175
00:14:19,333 --> 00:14:22,791
I've kept watch on you
from a similar remove.

176
00:14:22,875 --> 00:14:24,625
[CREA] Fudo...

177
00:14:24,708 --> 00:14:28,041
The very name conjures
images of The Immovable.

178
00:14:28,125 --> 00:14:31,541
But, can you be
unmoved even now?

179
00:14:32,041 --> 00:14:33,833
[CREA] All life will
wither in the shadow

180
00:14:33,916 --> 00:14:36,458
of Mikage's poisonous vision.

181
00:14:36,541 --> 00:14:38,583
The children
entrusted to our care

182
00:14:38,666 --> 00:14:40,541
not least among the damned.

183
00:14:40,625 --> 00:14:42,625
[CREA] All in keeping
with the pattern

184
00:14:42,708 --> 00:14:44,666
of a dusty old book.

185
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:46,708
Will your clarifying
distance be measured

186
00:14:46,791 --> 00:14:49,583
in lives lost to the
caprices of Fate?

187
00:14:51,833 --> 00:14:53,000
[CREA] Is this how
you want the story

188
00:14:53,083 --> 00:14:56,333
to draw to its close? Answer me!

189
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,125
[CREA] Fudo?!

190
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,125
[AMATA] You think I didn't
feel a powerful connection

191
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:19,916
to Mikono from the moment
I laid eyes on her?!

192
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,625
Even then I knew--without a
doubt--she shared my pain!

193
00:15:23,708 --> 00:15:25,458
[AMATA] We know loneliness!

194
00:15:25,541 --> 00:15:26,625
Yeah, she's awkward.

195
00:15:26,708 --> 00:15:28,291
She's got a hair-trigger temper.

196
00:15:28,375 --> 00:15:31,333
She gets insanely jealous
for no damn reason...

197
00:15:31,416 --> 00:15:33,708
[KAGURA] You know
nothing about her!

198
00:15:36,958 --> 00:15:39,416
[AMATA] Nobody sees her
faults better than I do...

199
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:42,791
Enough that sometimes
I even question how I feel.

200
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:45,875
But in the end, she's the glue
that holds it all together...

201
00:15:45,958 --> 00:15:48,291
That's always been
Mikono's strength...

202
00:15:48,375 --> 00:15:52,583
Not, "your Silvie"--
Mikono Suzushiro!

203
00:15:52,666 --> 00:15:54,000
[KAGURA] Shut up!

204
00:15:55,833 --> 00:15:58,416
[AMATA] That's the girl I love!

205
00:16:03,166 --> 00:16:05,416
[KAGURA]
You can't rewrite destiny!

206
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:07,208
[AMATA] If it wants to
come between me and her,

207
00:16:07,291 --> 00:16:09,291
destiny can kiss my ass!

208
00:16:10,416 --> 00:16:10,958
[AMATA] Mikono!

209
00:16:11,041 --> 00:16:12,625
[KAGURA] Silvie!

210
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:29,250
[MIKONO] Oh, no...
What are they doing...?

211
00:16:29,333 --> 00:16:30,750
Those idiots.

212
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:36,791
[MIKONO] Stop acting
like children, both of you!

213
00:16:36,875 --> 00:16:39,458
This is... This is wrong!

214
00:16:39,916 --> 00:16:41,541
[ZESSICA] How are
they acting like children?

215
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:42,958
[MIKONO] Zess?

216
00:16:43,041 --> 00:16:45,291
[ZESSICA] I advise you
to stay out of their fight...

217
00:16:45,375 --> 00:16:48,208
The only aura you'll be
merging with is mine...

218
00:16:48,291 --> 00:16:51,291
Life is a funny ol'
thing, don't you think?

219
00:16:51,375 --> 00:16:55,666
The ever-shifting
constellations. The betrayals...

220
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:57,416
[MIKONO] No way in
hell you're Zessica!

221
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:58,708
Who are you?!

222
00:17:01,666 --> 00:17:03,375
[MIKAGE] Who am I...

223
00:17:03,458 --> 00:17:05,666
An interesting question.

224
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:09,875
[MIKAGE] Someone for
whom, eons ago...

225
00:17:09,958 --> 00:17:12,666
...love was a grand undoing...

226
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:15,291
A heart, left behind.

227
00:17:15,375 --> 00:17:17,125
[MIKONO] So it's you!

228
00:17:17,208 --> 00:17:19,125
[MIKAGE] I who fought
the reincarnation

229
00:17:19,208 --> 00:17:21,708
of my betrayer
with such venom...

230
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:23,333
Who sunk my fangs into the boy,

231
00:17:23,416 --> 00:17:27,583
Apollo, presumed
manifestation of Apollonius...

232
00:17:27,666 --> 00:17:30,541
[MIKAGE] Only to find that,
beneath my hatred...

233
00:17:30,625 --> 00:17:33,625
An infinitesimal ember
of love throve.

234
00:17:34,916 --> 00:17:36,000
[MIKAGE] When called
upon by the boy

235
00:17:36,083 --> 00:17:38,916
to help spare our
dying world,...

236
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,500
I accepted, in hope
of remuneration.

237
00:17:42,583 --> 00:17:46,583
And indeed, to know again the
innocence of my ancient love

238
00:17:46,666 --> 00:17:50,208
seemed worth interminable
ages of suffering.

239
00:17:53,125 --> 00:17:55,083
[MIKAGE] But when
our souls touched,

240
00:17:55,166 --> 00:17:58,166
I knew myself lured into a trap.

241
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:01,125
For all my passion,
the callow upstart

242
00:18:01,208 --> 00:18:04,291
was not the new
body of Apollonius.

243
00:18:06,541 --> 00:18:10,041
[MIKAGE] Twice in love;
twice betrayed.

244
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:23,291
[MIKAGE] As the callous
trickster himself might say,

245
00:18:23,375 --> 00:18:25,333
"thus did millennia
of anguish eclipse

246
00:18:25,416 --> 00:18:28,000
the memory of a moment's peace."

247
00:18:30,416 --> 00:18:33,125
[MIKAGE] Altair and
Vega shall become one...

248
00:18:33,208 --> 00:18:35,916
And I shall rule as its Archon.

249
00:18:38,875 --> 00:18:41,625
[MIKAGE] "The invisible
worm who flies in the night,...

250
00:18:41,708 --> 00:18:43,583
through the howling storm,...

251
00:18:43,666 --> 00:18:47,416
has found out thy
bed of crimson joy,...

252
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:51,875
and does thy dark, secret
love... thy life destroy."

253
00:18:52,625 --> 00:18:56,166
[MIKAGE] To kill you a million
times will not sate me.

254
00:18:56,250 --> 00:19:00,291
I can do this forever...
And I shall!

255
00:19:06,125 --> 00:19:07,125
[MIKONO] What's happening?

256
00:19:08,458 --> 00:19:11,416
[MIKAGE] Welcome...
To your brother's vision!

257
00:19:17,208 --> 00:19:21,333
[MIKONO] No! No!!!

258
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:25,375
[AMATA] Mikono!

259
00:19:25,458 --> 00:19:26,875
[KAGURA] That was my Silvie!

260
00:19:34,291 --> 00:19:35,583
[AMATA] Whoa,
what in the hell is that?!

261
00:19:38,833 --> 00:19:41,958
[AMATA] Oh no...!
She's inside o' that thing!

262
00:19:43,458 --> 00:19:47,000
[MIKAGE] Give me
strength... Iron Sea...!

263
00:19:47,083 --> 00:19:50,000
Drain the mother
world of its last breath!

264
00:20:09,916 --> 00:20:11,000
[KAGURA] Bastard...!

265
00:20:11,083 --> 00:20:13,375
You don't care how
many people you kill!

266
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:23,291
[CAYENNE] Amata...!
Are you okay, man?!

267
00:20:23,375 --> 00:20:27,000
[AMATA] Cayenne!
Holy crap; you guys!

268
00:20:27,083 --> 00:20:29,041
[MALLOY] There's no time
--just take my place...

269
00:20:29,125 --> 00:20:30,833
They need your
power more than mine.

270
00:20:30,916 --> 00:20:32,916
You're their only shot now.

271
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,041
[YUNOHA] He's right...!
We need you for this!

272
00:20:35,125 --> 00:20:37,375
[AMATA] Then let's
make it happen!

273
00:20:43,708 --> 00:20:49,166
[AMATA] Final Battle Merge...!
Go... Aquarion!

274
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:58,958
[AMATA] Aquarion Evol!

275
00:21:00,041 --> 00:21:02,541
[AMATA] Let Mikono go,
you son of a bitch!

276
00:21:05,583 --> 00:21:08,333
[AMATA] She's ours!

277
00:21:10,333 --> 00:21:12,291
[MIKAGE] Punish
them, Iron Sea...

278
00:21:12,375 --> 00:21:14,250
Make them suffer.

279
00:21:18,833 --> 00:21:21,000
[MIKAGE] This is what
becomes of a winged mongrel

280
00:21:21,083 --> 00:21:25,541
who dares oppose
a god... Pitiful Kagura.

281
00:21:29,416 --> 00:21:38,500
[humming]

282
00:21:38,583 --> 00:21:42,958
[pained screaming]

283
00:21:52,333 --> 00:21:53,416
[AMATA] Kagura!

284
00:21:56,041 --> 00:21:57,958
[MIKAGE]
"Good night, sweet prince.

285
00:21:58,041 --> 00:22:01,208
Flights of angels
send thee to thy rest."

286
00:22:05,666 --> 00:22:10,375
[MIKAGE] Violation Merge...
Go... Aquarion.

287
00:22:19,041 --> 00:22:20,625
[MIKAGE] Ah, the beauty of it...

288
00:22:20,708 --> 00:22:23,041
The bountiful emptiness!

289
00:22:23,833 --> 00:22:25,458
[AMATA] Mikono!

290
00:22:36,875 --> 00:22:46,875
[AMATA] It's like...
Like our shadow...

291
00:22:46,958 --> 00:22:56,875
[AMATA] It's like...
Like our shadow...

292
00:22:56,958 --> 00:23:06,875
[AMATA] It's like...
Like our shadow...

293
00:23:06,958 --> 00:23:16,875
[AMATA] It's like...
Like our shadow...

294
00:23:16,958 --> 00:23:26,875
[AMATA] It's like...
Like our shadow...

295
00:23:26,958 --> 00:23:36,916
[AMATA] It's like...
Like our shadow...

296
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:46,916
[AMATA] It's like...
Like our shadow...

297
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:56,916
[AMATA] It's like...
Like our shadow...

298
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:06,916
[AMATA] It's like...
Like our shadow...

299
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:16,958
[AMATA] It's like...
Like our shadow...

300
00:24:17,041 --> 00:24:24,583
[AMATA] It's like...
Like our shadow...

301
00:24:24,666 --> 00:24:27,125
[AMATA] It was a miracle we
even met in the first place.

302
00:24:27,208 --> 00:24:30,333
[MIKONO] Let alone that we
could actually be together.

303
00:24:30,416 --> 00:24:31,708
[AMATA] Live the memory with me.

304
00:24:31,791 --> 00:24:33,583
[MIKONO] Live the
memory with me.

305
00:24:33,666 --> 00:24:36,541
[TOGETHER]
Let's... become one!
