1
00:00:24,583 --> 00:00:26,375
[AMATA] Damn you!

2
00:00:26,458 --> 00:00:31,333
Let Mikono go! Infinity Punch!

3
00:00:34,958 --> 00:00:38,125
[MIKAGE] Infinity? Hmph!

4
00:00:45,291 --> 00:00:46,708
[CAYENNE] You gotta
be kidding me!

5
00:00:46,791 --> 00:00:48,958
[YUNOHA] His moves...
seem different...

6
00:00:56,166 --> 00:00:58,000
[AMATA] What the
hell's he doin' to us?!

7
00:00:58,083 --> 00:00:59,625
[CAYENNE] It's effect
before cause, man.

8
00:00:59,708 --> 00:01:02,750
He's got the same arsenal;
it just works in reverse!

9
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:04,708
[MIKAGE] I do not
suffer wingless ones

10
00:01:04,791 --> 00:01:06,791
to speak of infinity...

11
00:01:06,875 --> 00:01:09,375
Poor, time-haunted insects...

12
00:01:09,458 --> 00:01:11,916
You see but through
a glass darkly;

13
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,333
the prism of cause
and effect is your prison.

14
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:05,875
[KAGURA] Where am I?

15
00:03:09,666 --> 00:03:11,291
[KAGURA] Silvie!

16
00:03:16,416 --> 00:03:17,666
[KAGURA] Silvie!

17
00:03:27,416 --> 00:03:28,875
[KAGURA] What's wrong
with this place...?

18
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:31,041
Why aren't I getting
any closer...?!

19
00:03:31,791 --> 00:03:36,166
[KAGURA] Silvie!
Aaaaaahh!

20
00:03:38,958 --> 00:03:40,750
[KAGURA] Son of a--!

21
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:47,583
[crying sounds]

22
00:03:47,666 --> 00:03:49,083
[ZESSICA] Help him, please...

23
00:03:49,166 --> 00:03:53,041
Amata is--suffering
because of me... Because...

24
00:03:53,125 --> 00:03:54,458
[KAGURA] Who are you?

25
00:03:54,541 --> 00:03:58,625
[ZESSICA] Someone trapped
in the mind of a shadow.

26
00:03:58,708 --> 00:04:01,916
Kill me... Kill me, please!

27
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,541
[KAGURA] What?

28
00:04:03,625 --> 00:04:06,625
[ZESSICA] I'm Mikage's
key to Solar Wing...

29
00:04:06,708 --> 00:04:09,916
kill me, and he's got nothing.

30
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,916
[ZESSICA] It's the
least I deserve now...

31
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,291
There isn't another way...

32
00:04:15,375 --> 00:04:17,791
And, even if there was, I...

33
00:04:17,875 --> 00:04:19,333
[ZESSICA] Mikono's
life's worth a dozen

34
00:04:19,416 --> 00:04:21,958
of a floozy like me...

35
00:04:22,041 --> 00:04:24,833
She's the one Amata's meant for.

36
00:04:36,541 --> 00:04:38,375
[ZESSICA] Just do it!

37
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:52,875
[YUNOHA] Can't take
any more of this!

38
00:04:52,958 --> 00:04:53,875
[CAYENNE] Dammit, the merge...

39
00:04:53,958 --> 00:04:55,958
it's about to fall apart!

40
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:02,083
[MIKAGE] Meddling fool!

41
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,125
[ZESSICA] Goodbye, love...

42
00:05:08,208 --> 00:05:10,250
I'm so sorry.

43
00:05:13,541 --> 00:05:15,166
[KAGURA] To hell with this.

44
00:05:18,833 --> 00:05:19,916
[ZESSICA] Why didn't--?

45
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,250
[KAGURA] Because...

46
00:05:21,333 --> 00:05:23,416
No one deserves to die
just for being in love...

47
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,041
Not with that jackass.

48
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:27,333
[ZESSICA] Jackass?

49
00:05:28,416 --> 00:05:30,416
[MIKAGE] Presumptive
wingless filth...!

50
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:34,416
I have transcended the
need for your putrid flesh!

51
00:05:41,666 --> 00:05:43,041
[MIKAGE] In the first days,

52
00:05:43,125 --> 00:05:46,208
Solar Wing required only one
entity, whole unto itself;

53
00:05:46,291 --> 00:05:50,000
not a throng of
backbiting fragments!

54
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:53,166
[MIKAGE] Now that she has been
awakened to her true self...

55
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:55,291
The Cursed Bride
is more than enough

56
00:05:55,375 --> 00:05:56,666
for me to helm an Angel.

57
00:06:00,833 --> 00:06:02,000
[KAGURA] Shit! Reversal!

58
00:06:02,083 --> 00:06:03,791
[ZESSICA] Contrary Twister!

59
00:06:08,583 --> 00:06:12,625
[MIKAGE] Hear ye now the
wedding bells of vengeance!

60
00:06:21,333 --> 00:06:22,500
[CAYENNE] What the
hell is going on?

61
00:06:22,583 --> 00:06:24,583
That's not my vision!

62
00:06:24,666 --> 00:06:28,125
[MIKAGE] Let this harlot's flesh
be anointed with blood...

63
00:06:28,208 --> 00:06:33,458
and I made godhead of
a new, loveless world!

64
00:06:42,125 --> 00:06:45,875
[MIKAGE] Come to me, Dark Sun.

65
00:07:00,416 --> 00:07:02,541
[AMATA] Cayenne...! Yunoha!

66
00:07:10,625 --> 00:07:12,583
[KAGURA] What has he done?!

67
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:25,791
[CIERRO] Global temperatures
are rising exponentially...!

68
00:07:25,875 --> 00:07:27,416
Water levels across the planet

69
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:29,291
are dropping like
there's no tomorrow--

70
00:07:29,375 --> 00:07:30,750
what is this?!

71
00:07:30,833 --> 00:07:32,958
[CREA] Solar Wing
has grown dark...

72
00:07:33,041 --> 00:07:37,375
He hangs in the sky as
a black, contrary star.

73
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:39,750
[ANDY] Let's go!

74
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:44,291
[AMATA] The world's
dying! Dammit...!

75
00:07:44,375 --> 00:07:46,958
What the hell can I do
with just one Vector?

76
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:48,791
[ANDY] Heads up...!

77
00:07:48,875 --> 00:07:50,500
I'm here to save your ass!

78
00:07:50,583 --> 00:07:51,916
[AMATA] Dude! Andy!

79
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,083
[MIX] I'm ready to
merge when you boys are.

80
00:07:54,166 --> 00:07:55,291
[AMATA] Mix, hey...!

81
00:07:55,375 --> 00:07:56,750
When did you get back?

82
00:07:56,833 --> 00:08:00,500
[loud piano music]

83
00:08:00,583 --> 00:08:01,666
[CAYENNE] Hold on a minute...

84
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:02,541
That sound...!

85
00:08:02,625 --> 00:08:03,250
[SUOMI] But it can't be!

86
00:08:03,333 --> 00:08:04,250
[DONAR] No friggin' way!

87
00:08:07,083 --> 00:08:10,333
[AIKA] Positive ID on the
vector last flown by Shrade...

88
00:08:10,416 --> 00:08:13,125
Except... there's
no sign of life...

89
00:08:15,416 --> 00:08:17,000
[EI] Another vector detected!

90
00:08:17,083 --> 00:08:19,041
[EI] Apparently the
one Zessica was last in...

91
00:08:19,125 --> 00:08:20,208
Yes: confirmed!

92
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:21,208
[DONAR] Excellent...!

93
00:08:21,291 --> 00:08:23,625
This is what I call a good omen!

94
00:08:23,708 --> 00:08:25,291
[SUOMI] We need only one more...

95
00:08:25,916 --> 00:08:27,083
[MALLOY] Um, hello?

96
00:08:27,166 --> 00:08:29,000
I'm still out here, in
case you're wondering.

97
00:08:29,083 --> 00:08:31,083
Vector Z, ready for action!

98

[MALLOY] A little heat
isn't gonna hurt me...

99
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,708
I grew up three miles away

100
00:08:35,791 --> 00:08:37,916
from the surface of the sun!

101

[SUOMI] Excellent!
That's three vectors!

Yunoha--redeploy, now...!

Malloy, prepare to switch...!

104
00:08:44,375 --> 00:08:47,333

piloted by yours truly!

[SUOMI] Chairwoman,
you don't mean that?!

106

[DONAR] Oh, come on...!

107
00:08:51,041 --> 00:08:52,500
You need a pilot out there!

[CREA] Calm yourself...

Both of you... Surely
I am expendable...

You, on the other hand...

111

Well, let's just say that you'll
make a splendid Adam and Eve.

112

think to fill my shoes.

118

I daresay-- overcome.

and my friends...

I want both worlds safe...
His and ours.

123
00:09:56,625 --> 00:09:57,791
[AMATA] Awesome, Shrade...

124
00:09:57,875 --> 00:09:58,875
You just couldn't
let your friends face

125
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:01,500
this one without
your beautiful music.

126
00:10:01,583 --> 00:10:03,208
[CREA] Now... For our lives!

127

[CAYENNE] For the sake
of those we love.

[ANDY] The sake
of those we love.

129

[YUNOHA] And...

130
00:10:08,166 --> 00:10:10,041
For the sake of
those we've lost.

present, and future!

[CAYENNE] Oh... this...
This is beautiful!

135
00:10:35,541 --> 00:10:37,333
We're becoming one!

136
00:10:37,416 --> 00:10:39,250
[SHRADE] Yes! Yes, we are!

137
00:10:39,333 --> 00:10:43,291
And it is beautiful--beyond
words, beyond death!

138
00:10:43,375 --> 00:10:46,041
[ANDY] I've never
felt so connected!

139

[MIX] I can feel the
hole in my heart closing!

[MIX] One rhythm!

142

[CREA] This is what
Fudo's wisdom was meant

143
00:10:54,791 --> 00:10:57,500
to prepare us for--
the union of hearts and minds

144

into a single
time-shattering soul!

Again now, into the breach!

[CAYENNE] One last time!

149

[MIKAGE] How amusing.

150
00:11:33,916 --> 00:11:35,541
[AMATA] What?

151
00:11:36,625 --> 00:11:38,208
[AMATA] Sorrow's had its day...

152
00:11:38,291 --> 00:11:41,833
Let what comes next surpass it.

153
00:11:41,916 --> 00:11:43,375

[CAYENNE] You got it!

157
00:11:57,541 --> 00:11:59,541
[CAYENNE] So how'd we do?

158
00:11:59,625 --> 00:12:01,583
[SHRADE] Quite admirably.

00:12:01,666 --> 00:12:02,958
[CAYENNE] No, wait!

160
00:12:03,041 --> 00:12:04,541
[YUNOHA] Look out!

161
00:12:06,166 --> 00:12:07,166
[CAYENNE] We're boxed in!

162
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:08,791
[CREA] Teleportation!

163
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:12,541
[CAYENNE] Holy crap!

164
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:22,791
[ANDY and MIX] Let's do this!
Take...! That...! Bastard!

165
00:12:26,333 --> 00:12:27,875
[CAYENNE] Molto agitato...

166
00:12:27,958 --> 00:12:30,708
[TOGETHER]
Behold The Requiem of Genesis!

167
00:12:47,958 --> 00:12:50,333
[CREA] I am getting way
too old for this shit.

168
00:12:50,416 --> 00:12:51,833
[CAYENNE] Come again?

169
00:12:52,708 --> 00:12:54,666
[MIKAGE] Impudent nothings!

170
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:59,583
[MIX] Spatial Augmentation!

171
00:13:01,416 --> 00:13:03,041
[AMATA] If you think
I'm giving up now...

172
00:13:03,125 --> 00:13:04,708
better think again!

173
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:09,416
[MIKAGE] Against a
thousand piercing arrows,

174
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:11,625
you yet stand fast.

175
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:14,916
Is your whore worth
anguish everlasting...?

176
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,541
Why not let me end
your suffering?

177
00:13:43,291 --> 00:13:44,291
[CREA] He's mad!

178
00:13:44,375 --> 00:13:47,041
He's pulling the
two planets together!

179
00:13:51,833 --> 00:13:52,833
[AMATA] He's draining
the life force

180
00:13:52,916 --> 00:13:54,625
from both worlds!

181
00:14:03,083 --> 00:14:04,375
[MIKONO] You're the
incarnation of Pollon

182
00:14:04,458 --> 00:14:07,000
from twelve thousand years ago!

183
00:14:07,083 --> 00:14:09,458
[APOLLO] Yeah...
I know that scent.

184
00:14:09,541 --> 00:14:14,416
[MIKONO] Huh?! Apollo...
It's really you, isn't it?

185
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:20,083
[SIRIUS] Sorrow's had its day...

186
00:14:20,166 --> 00:14:23,250
Let what comes next surpass it.

187
00:14:24,458 --> 00:14:25,916
[MIKONO] Brother!

188
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:29,583
[TOMA] Unlikely issue
of man and angel...

189
00:14:29,666 --> 00:14:34,333
Both my pain...
and my salvation...

190
00:14:34,416 --> 00:14:36,041
[MIKONO] Toma!

191
00:14:39,083 --> 00:14:44,708
[MIKONO] Please.
Forgive me... I... I'm so sorry.

192
00:14:44,791 --> 00:14:46,333
[MIKONO] I'm responsible...

193
00:14:46,416 --> 00:14:50,375
The three of you laid
down your lives... for me.

194
00:14:50,458 --> 00:14:51,958
[SIRIUS] Don't be sorry...

195
00:14:52,041 --> 00:14:56,250
You answered a need as best
you knew how; as did we.

196
00:14:56,333 --> 00:14:58,041
There's no dishonor in that.

197
00:14:58,125 --> 00:15:00,291
[APOLLO] Damn right there's not.

198
00:15:00,375 --> 00:15:04,375
And hey... I got
to keep my promise.

199
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:07,041
[MIKONO] Amata!

200
00:15:07,125 --> 00:15:08,666
[SILVIA] Apollo!

201
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:10,041
[TOMA] Because of you...

202
00:15:10,125 --> 00:15:13,416
Man and Angel
came together as one.

203
00:15:19,166 --> 00:15:20,500
[MIKAGE] Fetid bitch...!

204
00:15:20,583 --> 00:15:22,458
Because of you, an
angel's heart lay crushed

205
00:15:22,541 --> 00:15:25,833
beneath the heel of man not
once, but twice!

206
00:15:27,208 --> 00:15:28,625
[FUDO] Calm yourself.

207
00:15:28,708 --> 00:15:30,208
[MIKONO] Commander Fudo!

208
00:15:30,291 --> 00:15:31,541
[FUDO] Fear not...

209
00:15:31,625 --> 00:15:33,958
Tis only a shade of
Toma's complex heart,

210
00:15:34,041 --> 00:15:35,875
wrenched from wider context.

211
00:15:35,958 --> 00:15:39,708
[MIKONO] Like a
fragment? Mikage!

212
00:15:39,791 --> 00:15:41,583
[FUDO] Face the dark, my dear...

213
00:15:41,666 --> 00:15:45,416
You must see the whole story
in its sad unfolding.

214
00:15:46,708 --> 00:15:49,500
[FUDO] Master your fear
and embrace the truth...

215
00:15:49,583 --> 00:15:51,291
It is time, Mikono.

216
00:15:53,541 --> 00:15:55,416
[MIKAGE] Why, Apollonius?

217
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:59,458
Why...? My love
for you was pure!

218
00:16:02,166 --> 00:16:04,083
[MIKAGE] Unfaithful heart.

219
00:16:04,166 --> 00:16:08,666
Witness the terrible immolation
of all you hold dear!

220
00:16:17,666 --> 00:16:18,583
[ANDY] Mix, no!

221
00:16:21,833 --> 00:16:22,875
[ZESSICA] He broke the merge!

222
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:24,500
[KAGURA] And with just one move!

223
00:16:29,958 --> 00:16:31,166
[ZESSICA] No! Amata!

224
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:33,791
[KAGURA] Mikage...!
Well, I've had enough...

225
00:16:33,875 --> 00:16:36,583
How 'bout you and me get
in there and stop this?

226
00:16:38,958 --> 00:16:39,958
[ZESSICA] Ah, what the hell...

227
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:42,000
I'm down for it if you are.

228
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,416
[ZESSICA] Amata!

229
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:49,125
[AMATA] Zessica! Kagura!
What the--?!

230
00:16:49,208 --> 00:16:50,708
[KAGURA] Save it;
we're here to help.

231
00:16:50,791 --> 00:16:51,583
[ZESSICA] Think about it...!

232
00:16:51,666 --> 00:16:53,250
The three of us can take him!

233
00:16:53,333 --> 00:16:56,791
[ZESSICA] Come on, man...
Do it for Mikono.

234
00:16:56,875 --> 00:17:00,375
[AMATA] You really...?
Thanks, Zess.

235
00:17:00,458 --> 00:17:01,666
[ZESSICA] We'll talk later...

236
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:04,458
Now let's kick this
guy's ass into next week.

237
00:17:04,916 --> 00:17:06,791
[AMATA] Fine, whatever...
Let's go.

238
00:17:06,875 --> 00:17:07,666
[KAGURA] You dummy...

239
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:09,166
Way to make the poor girl cry...

240
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:10,208
Maybe it's your ass

241
00:17:10,291 --> 00:17:12,250
we should kick
into next week, huh?

242
00:17:14,083 --> 00:17:15,500
[ZESSICA] Hold on
to your hats...

243
00:17:15,583 --> 00:17:17,083
Selfless Love Merge...

244
00:17:17,166 --> 00:17:18,500
[KAGURA] Go!

245
00:17:18,583 --> 00:17:21,458
[AMATA] Aquarion!

246
00:17:25,833 --> 00:17:29,125
[AMATA] Compassion
within strength.

247
00:17:29,208 --> 00:17:30,958
[KAGURA] Fire within weakness.

248
00:17:31,041 --> 00:17:33,500
[ZESSICA] This is amazing!

249
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:38,125
[TOGETHER] Aquarion Evol!

250
00:17:39,833 --> 00:17:40,541
[MIKAGE] Apollonius...

251
00:17:40,625 --> 00:17:41,875
[MIKONO] What's happening?

252
00:17:41,958 --> 00:17:44,583
[MIKAGE] Apollonius...

253
00:17:44,666 --> 00:17:45,416
[TOMA] My heart...

254
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:46,291
[MIKAGE] My pain...

255
00:17:46,375 --> 00:17:47,166
[MIKONO] You loved him so much

256
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:48,833
that it drove you to madness.

257
00:17:48,916 --> 00:17:52,708
Everything you cared
about... was from him...

258
00:17:52,791 --> 00:17:54,541
The one you lived for...

259
00:17:54,625 --> 00:17:57,708
Your soul mate... Abandoned you.

260
00:17:57,791 --> 00:18:02,875
[TOMA and MIKAGE] You love her
that much? That much?!

261
00:18:04,916 --> 00:18:10,083
[TOMA and MIKAGE]
I... I love him still.

262
00:18:10,833 --> 00:18:12,916
[MIKONO] After
everything he'd done...

263
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,500
Part of you...
still forgave him.

264
00:18:18,583 --> 00:18:21,916
[MIKAGE] Yes... Become one...

265
00:18:23,208 --> 00:18:25,916
[MIKONO] I'm so sorry...
I never...

266
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,666
We never meant to hurt you.

267
00:18:29,166 --> 00:18:30,541
[MIKONO] I couldn't bring
myself to acknowledge

268
00:18:30,625 --> 00:18:32,250
I'd stolen him from you.

269
00:18:32,333 --> 00:18:34,750
But at the end of the day,
that's what I did.

270
00:18:34,833 --> 00:18:36,916
[MIKAGE] You... dare ask
forgiveness?!

271
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,333
[MIKONO] I deserve
whatever you do to me.

272
00:18:39,416 --> 00:18:41,166
But if you ever
loved him as I did,

273
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:43,291
you will spare these people!

274
00:18:43,875 --> 00:18:45,750
[AMATA] Mikono!

275
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:48,000
[MIKONO] No, Amata! Stay back!

276
00:18:49,208 --> 00:18:50,875
[MIKONO] Save yourselves!
I'm not worth it!

277
00:18:50,958 --> 00:18:51,875
[AMATA] Like hell...!

278
00:18:51,958 --> 00:18:53,875
I'd die a thousand
times for you!

279
00:18:53,958 --> 00:18:55,250
[MIKONO] Damn it, listen to me!

280
00:18:55,333 --> 00:18:56,458
Don't do this!

281
00:18:56,541 --> 00:18:57,458
[AMATA] What?!

282
00:18:57,541 --> 00:18:59,166
[MIKONO] Just let
me handle it...

283
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:01,166
I can fix this...

284
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:02,833
Connecting is what I do...!

285
00:19:02,916 --> 00:19:05,500
So let me bring love
and hate together!

286
00:19:07,291 --> 00:19:09,375
[MIKAGE] Enough
of your platitudes!

287
00:19:12,458 --> 00:19:14,291
[AMATA] Let her go!

288
00:19:17,125 --> 00:19:18,125
[KAGURA] Reversal!

289
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:25,916
[AMATA] Ready...!
All Together... Punch!

290
00:19:31,625 --> 00:19:34,666
[TOGETHER] Attaaaack!

291
00:19:38,375 --> 00:19:39,708
[AMATA and ZESSICA] Mikono!
[KAGURA] Silvie!

292
00:19:41,625 --> 00:19:43,083
[MIKAGE] Pitiful!

293
00:19:46,208 --> 00:19:48,416
[ZESSICA] Dammit...!
He's burning us alive!

294
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:51,583
[AMATA] He'll have to
do better than that...!

295
00:19:51,666 --> 00:19:53,000
I'm not giving up...!

296
00:19:53,083 --> 00:19:55,666
Do you hear me, Mikage?!

297
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:59,958
[AMATA] I let mom slip
away--but no, never again!

298
00:20:00,041 --> 00:20:03,416
'Cause I get it now:
that's what I put Silvia--

299
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:05,250
what I put Mikono through

300
00:20:05,333 --> 00:20:08,000
when I left her twelve
thousand years ago.

301
00:20:08,083 --> 00:20:10,625
[AMATA] The whole point
of being brought back

302
00:20:10,708 --> 00:20:12,291
after all this time
was to realize

303
00:20:12,375 --> 00:20:14,625
how badly I'd screwed up.

304
00:20:15,166 --> 00:20:17,208
[AMATA] I'm not putting
you through that again...

305
00:20:17,291 --> 00:20:21,208
We're in this together...!
I want to be with you.

306
00:20:21,291 --> 00:20:24,583
For all of eternity...
I love you!

307
00:20:25,875 --> 00:20:27,458
[MIKONO] Please, Amata--!

308
00:20:28,416 --> 00:20:31,041
[MIKAGE] Contemptible
winged hound!

309
00:20:42,208 --> 00:20:45,125
[AMATA] Is this it...?
Is this how it ends?

310
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:47,625
[EI] Amata's aura
levels have plummeted!

311
00:20:47,708 --> 00:20:48,750
[CIERRO] Not just his.

312
00:20:48,833 --> 00:20:50,666
The whole crew's on
a downward spiral!

313
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:53,958
[SAZANKA] But, I...
I thought they had this!

314
00:20:57,208 --> 00:21:00,375
[MIKONO] Amata... Please, no.

315
00:21:05,625 --> 00:21:07,291
[YUNOHA] It's not over.

316
00:21:14,375 --> 00:21:17,333
[YUNOHA] Is that...?
Jin, is that you?!

317
00:21:17,416 --> 00:21:20,125
[JIN] I just couldn't
stay away...

318
00:21:20,208 --> 00:21:23,458
In the end we're all
in this together, right?

319
00:21:23,541 --> 00:21:25,833
[YUNOHA] Yes. We are.

320
00:21:30,625 --> 00:21:31,916
[CAYENNE] What's she doing?

321
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:34,166
[CREA] I can feel Jin's aura!

322
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,833
[YUNOHA] I can feel
Jin washing over me!

323
00:21:45,125 --> 00:21:47,458
[YUNOHA] Our hearts
are beating as one.

324
00:21:47,541 --> 00:21:49,458
[JIN] Because we were
meant for each other...

325
00:21:49,541 --> 00:21:52,666
Death has no hold over love!

326
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:10,750
[YUNOHA] Come on, Amata.

327
00:22:10,833 --> 00:22:13,625
[JIN] Wakey wakey.

328
00:22:13,708 --> 00:22:15,958
[CAYENNE] We need you.

329
00:22:16,041 --> 00:22:18,166
[CREA] Desperately.

330
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:19,625
[ZESSICA] It's okay, Amata.

331
00:22:21,166 --> 00:22:23,166
[KAGURA] You've got this.

332
00:22:24,333 --> 00:22:26,291
[MIKONO] I believe in you.

333
00:22:27,458 --> 00:22:30,833
[FUDO] Let go, Amata...
Just not too much.

334
00:22:30,916 --> 00:22:32,958
[ALICIA] Amata...

335
00:22:33,041 --> 00:22:34,791
[IZUMO] My son.

336
00:22:34,875 --> 00:22:37,416
[AMATA] Mom... Dad...

337
00:22:47,916 --> 00:22:48,791
[ZESSICA] Holy--!

338
00:22:48,875 --> 00:22:50,500
[KAGURA] Amata!

339
00:22:50,958 --> 00:22:52,791
[AMATA] I know
you can, Mikono...

340
00:22:52,875 --> 00:22:55,000
But you shouldn't have
to do this yourself,

341
00:22:55,083 --> 00:22:57,458
not when you've got me!

342
00:22:59,916 --> 00:23:01,291
[AMATA] That's the
point, isn't it?

343
00:23:01,375 --> 00:23:03,750
That's what
connection's all about...!

344
00:23:03,833 --> 00:23:06,083
Not having to go it alone!

345
00:23:06,166 --> 00:23:09,791
Well, over my dead body
will you ever need to!

346
00:23:14,291 --> 00:23:15,791
[AMATA] Whether you
and I die right here

347
00:23:15,875 --> 00:23:17,666
and now in a blaze of glory...

348
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:19,208
Or get to spend our final days

349
00:23:19,291 --> 00:23:21,875
hand in hand as some
cheesy old couple...

350
00:23:21,958 --> 00:23:24,000
I'm with you to the end!

351
00:23:24,083 --> 00:23:26,000
[AMATA] That's the
thing about infinity...

352
00:23:26,083 --> 00:23:28,916
It's not forever; it's now!

353
00:23:33,958 --> 00:23:35,041
[ZESSICA] Oh wow...

354
00:23:35,125 --> 00:23:36,583
[KAGURA] Bastard's
out of his mind...

355
00:23:36,666 --> 00:23:37,458
Look at him.

356
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:39,833
We were thrown into this life...

357
00:23:39,916 --> 00:23:40,916
for the sole purpose

358
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,833
of rekindling our
love with Silvie.

359
00:23:43,916 --> 00:23:46,166
[KAGURA] But he doesn't
give a damn about that.

360
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:48,375
To him, she's just Mikono!

361
00:23:51,166 --> 00:23:52,083
[KAGURA] What're
you waiting for...?!

362
00:23:52,166 --> 00:23:53,458
End the cycle and tell Fate

363
00:23:53,541 --> 00:23:56,333
to shove it where
the sun don't shine!

364
00:23:57,625 --> 00:23:58,875
[AMATA] Kagura!

365
00:24:03,083 --> 00:24:05,416
[AMATA] I'm coming
for you, Mikono!

366
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:07,291
[MIKONO] And
I'm waiting for you!

367
00:24:07,375 --> 00:24:12,791
[AMATA] New Genesis Union!
Go...! Aquarion Evol...!

368
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:19,458
[MIKAGE] What is this?!

369
00:24:22,583 --> 00:24:25,791
[KAGURA] Sorry, sport...
You got it backwards this time.

370
00:24:25,875 --> 00:24:28,791
Plus, Evol just
sounds kinda stupid.

371
00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:34,833
[AMATA ] Then let's
make it Aquarion Love!

372
00:24:38,166 --> 00:24:40,208
[MIKONO] We've done it,
Amata...! Ha!

373
00:24:40,291 --> 00:24:42,083
[AMATA] Mikono!

374
00:24:42,666 --> 00:24:44,083
[MIKONO] I...

375
00:24:44,166 --> 00:24:46,375
[AMATA] No...
Don't say it alone!

376
00:24:47,458 --> 00:24:49,500
[TOGETHER]
I... love you!

377
00:25:03,125 --> 00:25:06,583
[ZESSICA] Come on, you two...
Get a room, huh?

378
00:25:11,708 --> 00:25:14,000
[SUOMI] It's so... Beautiful.

379
00:25:14,083 --> 00:25:15,500
[DONAR] The tears of
Aquarion Love are...

380
00:25:15,583 --> 00:25:18,125
bringing life back to
our damaged planet!

381
00:25:18,208 --> 00:25:21,541
[CREA] The two worlds are
being reunited as lovers!

382
00:25:35,250 --> 00:25:38,250
[MIKAGE] No...
This is not over yet...

383
00:25:38,333 --> 00:25:39,916
I need only find a body!

384
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,208
I need only find a body...!

385
00:25:46,125 --> 00:25:48,375
[MIKAGE] Let it be you!

386
00:25:53,583 --> 00:25:54,916
[MIKAGE] Why can't I move...?

387
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,208
Why will you not submit to me?!

388
00:26:00,708 --> 00:26:01,916
[MIKAGE] Apollonius?

389
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,291
[FUDO] Let it be done...

390
00:26:03,375 --> 00:26:05,333
Take your place
in my heart again.

391
00:26:06,625 --> 00:26:09,541
[FUDO] Sleep by thy
master, poor shade...

392
00:26:09,625 --> 00:26:12,083
We shall watch over
this eon together...

393
00:26:12,166 --> 00:26:14,833
As we did in the first days.

394
00:26:14,916 --> 00:26:16,458
[FUDO] Let us be one...

395
00:26:16,541 --> 00:26:18,166
And measure the march of ages

396
00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:20,291
in movements of the heart.

397
00:26:22,666 --> 00:26:24,666
[MIKAGE] How
can I forgive you...?

398
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:29,250
You betrayed me
twice... And yet...

399
00:26:29,333 --> 00:26:35,291
And yet I feel so complete
within you... So, safe.

400
00:28:01,875 --> 00:28:03,083
[ZESSICA] Shush?

401
00:28:32,625 --> 00:28:34,875
[EVERYONE] Amata!

402
00:28:40,750 --> 00:28:43,000
[FUDO] Love...
is no longer a sin.
