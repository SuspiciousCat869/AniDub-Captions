1
00:00:17,083 --> 00:00:18,666
[AMATA] We're flying blind here!

2
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:20,875
[ZESSICA] The hell's
with the controls?!

3
00:00:22,708 --> 00:00:27,541
[SHRADE] Welcome to Purgatory.
The chaos between worlds...

4
00:00:27,625 --> 00:00:30,291
The substance of dissonance.

5
00:00:34,875 --> 00:00:36,458
[SHRADE] We don't
have much time...

6
00:00:36,541 --> 00:00:38,750
Nothing endures this for long--

7
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:41,750
[ZESSICA] Oh no, Shrade!

8
00:00:41,833 --> 00:00:44,083
[SHRADE] We have
to merge immediately.

9
00:00:44,166 --> 00:00:45,875
[AMATA] Your body
can't handle it!

10
00:00:51,291 --> 00:00:53,125
[SHRADE] Please
just do this for me...

11
00:00:53,208 --> 00:00:56,750
I cannot pass on before I've
finished the music of limbo.

12
00:00:56,833 --> 00:00:58,791
[AMATA] Dude, please, no...

13
00:00:59,125 --> 00:01:00,958
[SHRADE] Succumb to the tide...!

14
00:01:01,041 --> 00:01:04,041
Force it... to... To resolve!

15
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:11,458
[SHRADE] Let the
melody sweep you

16
00:01:11,541 --> 00:01:13,583
beyond your limitations...

17
00:01:13,666 --> 00:01:16,916
Even if you must
be my pallbearers...

18
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:22,208
[SHRADE] Resounding Merge...!
Go...! Aquarion!

19
00:01:35,625 --> 00:01:37,666
[CREA] All present
and accounted for?

20
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:40,333
It's time you plunge
headlong into The Truth.

21
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:46,458
[FUDO] The story is
a very ancient one...

22
00:01:46,541 --> 00:01:48,791
Its themes resonate
across eras...

23
00:01:48,875 --> 00:01:50,791
A tale twelve
thousand years old,

24
00:01:50,875 --> 00:01:53,958
reaching back yet twelve
thousand years before that...

25
00:01:54,041 --> 00:01:56,500
And back further still.

26
00:01:56,583 --> 00:01:57,916
[CAYENNE] With
all due respect...!

27
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,166
I think maybe we can
wait on the fireside chat

28
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:02,625
'til after we've gotten
off our asses and--

29
00:02:09,791 --> 00:02:11,541
[CAYENNE] What the hell?

30
00:02:11,625 --> 00:02:13,458
[ANDY
'kay, this is trippy...

31
00:02:17,458 --> 00:02:18,916
[YUNOHA] Are we on a book?

32
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,458
[FUDO] "Those who
say we've only one life

33
00:02:20,541 --> 00:02:22,916
to live know not how to read."

34
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,500
[FUDO] Let us say the
volume upon which you stand

35
00:02:25,583 --> 00:02:28,250
is in fact the writ
of your very souls...

36
00:02:28,333 --> 00:02:31,833
Long referred to as
the Book of Twin Stars.

37
00:02:31,916 --> 00:02:34,875
[FUDO] Long tucked away.

38
00:02:37,166 --> 00:02:38,458
[FUDO] Now opened!

39
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:49,291
[CREA] We begin
24,000 years ago;

40
00:02:49,375 --> 00:02:52,250
a span of years
almost unfathomable.

41
00:02:59,208 --> 00:03:00,625
[CAYENNE] These visions...

42
00:03:00,708 --> 00:03:03,375
They're even more lifelike
than my prophecies.

43
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:25,208
[SHRADE] This sword
is my tuning fork...

44
00:03:25,291 --> 00:03:28,791
The resonance of its edge
my thoroughfare home.

45
00:03:30,208 --> 00:03:35,416
[resonating tones]

46
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:36,875
[ZESSICA] Okay,
explain this, please?

47
00:03:36,958 --> 00:03:38,750
[SHRADE] Memories
have awakened...

48
00:03:38,833 --> 00:03:41,333
Summoned across the
divide 'twixt the worlds

49
00:03:41,416 --> 00:03:43,375
from whence they flower--

50
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:45,625
[AMATA] Shrade, no!

51
00:03:45,708 --> 00:03:47,083
[ZESSICA] Hang on!

52
00:03:47,458 --> 00:03:49,041
[SHRADE] Just keep watching!

53
00:03:59,208 --> 00:04:02,833
[CREA] Humanity was once driven
to the edge of extinction.

54
00:04:04,791 --> 00:04:08,583
[CREA] Imperiled by they
known as-- Shadow Angels...

55
00:04:08,666 --> 00:04:12,208
[CREA] The solemn death knell
of the species was wrung.

56
00:04:13,458 --> 00:04:17,041
[CREA] Behold your
greatest foe, Apollonius:

57
00:04:17,125 --> 00:04:18,750
Angel of Slaughter.

58
00:04:21,833 --> 00:04:22,791
[CREA] And yet...

59
00:04:22,875 --> 00:04:25,000
Love found in an unlikely place

60
00:04:25,083 --> 00:04:28,416
softened his fierce,
gore-besot brow.

61
00:04:30,208 --> 00:04:32,333
[CREA] A human warrior,
named Celiane--

62
00:04:32,416 --> 00:04:36,000
at first his enemy--became,
by a cruel twist of fate,

63
00:04:36,083 --> 00:04:38,666
the very essence of his heart.

64
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:42,833
[CAYENNE] Wait, that's...

65
00:04:42,916 --> 00:04:44,958
[AMATA] The Legendary Aquarion!

66
00:04:45,541 --> 00:04:47,375
[CREA] Apollonius
turned on his brothers

67
00:04:47,458 --> 00:04:50,083
for the sake of
star-crossed love...

68
00:04:50,166 --> 00:04:52,125
driving back the
angel scourge through

69
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:56,041
a distillation of his fearsome
essence: Aquarion.

70
00:04:56,125 --> 00:04:57,500
[CREA] Yet for
every ray of hope,

71
00:04:57,583 --> 00:04:59,916
there is an attendant shadow...

72
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,083
To protect Celiane,

73
00:05:01,166 --> 00:05:04,041
he betrayed Toma,
his long-betrothed...

74
00:05:04,125 --> 00:05:06,375
Twisting his first
love into a coil

75
00:05:06,458 --> 00:05:09,041
of bitter, unrequited desire.

76
00:05:10,916 --> 00:05:12,916
[CREA] There was yet another...

77
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,041
A fulsome creature,
given to light.

78
00:05:16,875 --> 00:05:18,333
[ANDY] Whoa... What the...?

79
00:05:18,416 --> 00:05:20,041
[YUNOHA] Aw! Look at'chu!

80
00:05:20,125 --> 00:05:23,750
[CREA] Behold Pollon,
the winged hound...

81
00:05:23,833 --> 00:05:26,583
Apollonius's loyal friend...

82
00:05:26,666 --> 00:05:29,416
He, too, bore a
bittersweet burden...

83
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:32,083
for his master's new love.

84
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:36,583
[CREA] Beneath a
windswept blanket of stars,

85
00:05:36,666 --> 00:05:39,208
the sullen creature cast a wish:

86
00:05:39,291 --> 00:05:43,000
To be reunited with
Celiane in another life.

87
00:05:44,666 --> 00:05:47,208
[CREA] Hence was
treacherous love born aloft...

88
00:05:47,291 --> 00:05:49,458
Toma's heartache,
Pollon's desire,

89
00:05:49,541 --> 00:05:52,666
and Apollonius and
Celiane's romance...

90
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:54,375
[CREA] Swallowed by time...

91
00:05:54,458 --> 00:05:56,416
Echoes through the dark abyss...

92
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:59,791
The march of countless such
sagas modeled thereupon...

93
00:05:59,875 --> 00:06:03,750
We bring them now to
their ultimate conclusion.

94
00:06:03,833 --> 00:06:07,333
Writ on parchment,
bound in lace.

95
00:06:07,416 --> 00:06:09,416
[CREA] If the
noonday sun be life,

96
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,250
and the midnight moon death...

97
00:06:11,333 --> 00:06:12,708
let them blur...

98
00:06:12,791 --> 00:06:15,500
Let their gradient
'round us be one.

99
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,041
[FUDO] Pay heed!

100
00:06:19,125 --> 00:06:22,666
The first chord of the final
cadence has been struck!

101
00:06:27,208 --> 00:06:28,583
[ZESSICA] Not this
again, please...!

102
00:06:28,666 --> 00:06:30,875
[AMATA] Yeah, I know
these visions too.

103
00:06:30,958 --> 00:06:33,208
[CREA] The Shadow
Angels resurfaced...

104
00:06:33,291 --> 00:06:35,291
Bitterly resolved against us...

105
00:06:35,375 --> 00:06:37,208
Their bloody work of
twelve thousand years

106
00:06:37,291 --> 00:06:38,875
before began anew...

107
00:06:38,958 --> 00:06:41,041
But Humanity's
salvation rang down

108
00:06:41,125 --> 00:06:44,583
through the ages as legend;
a hope remembered.

109
00:06:45,875 --> 00:06:47,541
[SUOMI] High Commander?

110
00:06:47,625 --> 00:06:50,500
[DONAR] Wait a sec,
how the hell old is this guy?!

111
00:06:50,583 --> 00:06:51,500
[ANDY] But what we're seeing

112
00:06:51,583 --> 00:06:53,291
happened twelve-thousand
years ago!

113
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:58,166
[FUDO] This is the
core of our story...!

114
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:01,041
Behold the cruel
machinations of Fate!

115
00:07:07,041 --> 00:07:08,666
[CREA] Mankind followed
the legends deep

116
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:10,541
within the earth and
hoisted their salvation

117
00:07:10,625 --> 00:07:12,250
into the light of day...

118
00:07:12,333 --> 00:07:14,333
Aquarion was reborn.

119
00:07:14,416 --> 00:07:16,541
[CREA] In place of
its former master,

120
00:07:16,625 --> 00:07:18,625
the Machine Angel
had a new pilot,

121
00:07:18,708 --> 00:07:21,083
a new incarnation of
its warrior spirit...

122
00:07:21,166 --> 00:07:22,958
A young boy, called Apollo.

123
00:07:23,041 --> 00:07:25,250
[ANDY] So then...
he was Apollonius?

124
00:07:25,333 --> 00:07:26,958
[CAYENNE] Had to have been.

125
00:07:27,041 --> 00:07:28,666
[CREA] Do not be deceived.

126
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:32,791
[CREA] He was, rather,
the loyal Pollon.

127
00:07:39,916 --> 00:07:41,000
[IZUMO] I'm sorry...

128
00:07:41,083 --> 00:07:42,416
But, I've no choice;

129
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:45,708
you've committed an act of
incontrovertible treason.

130
00:07:45,791 --> 00:07:47,666
I hereby banish you...

131
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:50,083
You are no longer of Altair.

132
00:07:54,166 --> 00:07:55,333
[KAGURA] Big deal!

133
00:07:59,625 --> 00:08:02,125
[KAGURA] I don't care;
I've got everything I want!

134
00:08:03,208 --> 00:08:06,875
[MIKONO] Apollo... I'm so...

135
00:08:08,208 --> 00:08:10,375
[CREA] The celestial
hound reemerged...

136
00:08:10,458 --> 00:08:13,541
as a fiery, red-haired boy.

137
00:08:13,625 --> 00:08:15,708
[ANDY] So all this time,
the dude from the legends...

138
00:08:15,791 --> 00:08:17,875
[SAZANKA] ...was actually a dog?

139
00:08:17,958 --> 00:08:20,208
[CREA] And the object
of his unrequited love

140
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:22,333
came down to us as Silvia,

141
00:08:22,416 --> 00:08:24,708
incarnation of Celiane...

142
00:08:24,791 --> 00:08:26,166
The young couple
were brought together

143
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:28,583
under the harsh
auspices of battle,

144
00:08:28,666 --> 00:08:30,750
and there became entwined.

145
00:08:30,833 --> 00:08:32,458
[CREA] However...

146
00:08:32,541 --> 00:08:34,750
Their love was not
to be an easy one.

147
00:08:37,291 --> 00:08:39,833
[CREA] Toma, the stain
of Apollonius's guilt,

148
00:08:39,916 --> 00:08:42,375
awoke into the selfsame age...

149
00:08:42,458 --> 00:08:44,791
With him came a bitter
hatred for the people

150
00:08:44,875 --> 00:08:48,333
his unfaithful lover
defended in ages past;

151
00:08:48,416 --> 00:08:52,333
a cruel, insatiable yen
to destroy humanity.

152
00:08:52,416 --> 00:08:54,541
[CREA] So powerful
was his loathing,

153
00:08:54,625 --> 00:08:57,708
it brought down
even his own kind...

154
00:08:57,791 --> 00:08:59,833
The Tree of Life,
the boon upon which

155
00:08:59,916 --> 00:09:03,958
the Shadow Angels depended,
declined to bear fruit,

156
00:09:04,041 --> 00:09:08,833
and under Toma's twisted love
for Apollonius, withered.

157
00:09:11,875 --> 00:09:13,083
[APOLLO] I have to go.

158
00:09:13,166 --> 00:09:16,458
But I'll find you again...
I promise.

159
00:09:17,916 --> 00:09:19,541
[SILVIA] Apollo!

160
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:21,291
[APOLLO] All right, it's time.

161
00:09:21,375 --> 00:09:22,250
[SIRIUS] For the angels...

162
00:09:22,333 --> 00:09:23,666
[TOMA] And the humans...

163
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:25,916
Prepare for... Genesis!

164
00:09:30,041 --> 00:09:33,416
[CREA] Sadly, Pollon's
love remained unfulfilled...

165
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:37,000
The loyal beast, having
waited twelve thousand years,

166
00:09:37,083 --> 00:09:40,416
would bear the agonizing
march of millennia still.

167
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:44,416
[CREA] Thus was
the world born anew--

168
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,666
from his sacrifice.

169
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:59,625
[FUDO] And here,
we soar upward, through

170
00:09:59,708 --> 00:10:03,125
that millennial march
to the story's third act.

171
00:10:03,208 --> 00:10:04,500
[ANDY] Do what?

172
00:10:04,583 --> 00:10:06,083
[DONAR] Third act?

173
00:10:06,166 --> 00:10:07,333
[FUDO] Correct...

174
00:10:07,416 --> 00:10:10,875
The act... In which you live.

175
00:10:21,083 --> 00:10:23,166
[YUNOHA]
The planet split in two!

176
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:24,833
[CREA] With the
Tree of Life desiccated,

177
00:10:24,916 --> 00:10:27,083
the world grew
corrupt, fragile...

178
00:10:27,166 --> 00:10:30,541
But it did not crumble,
so much as split in twain.

179
00:10:30,625 --> 00:10:31,708
[FUDO] Dark and Light.

180
00:10:31,791 --> 00:10:34,791
Yin and Yang. Male and Female...

181
00:10:34,875 --> 00:10:36,750
Two worlds in
sympathetic orbit...

182
00:10:36,833 --> 00:10:39,500
Lovers cruelly estranged
by vast reaches

183
00:10:39,583 --> 00:10:41,166
of unforgiving cosmos...

184
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:43,791
Torn from one
another's warm embrace.

185
00:10:46,708 --> 00:10:48,208
[FUDO] Behold...

186
00:10:48,291 --> 00:10:50,791
Altair and Vega:
Two forlorn aspects

187
00:10:50,875 --> 00:10:52,833
of a single, former Earth.

188
00:10:52,916 --> 00:10:53,958
[MALLOY] Seriously...?!

189
00:10:54,041 --> 00:10:55,291
We were the same planet?

190
00:10:55,375 --> 00:10:57,000
[DONAR] This is incredible...!

191
00:10:57,083 --> 00:10:59,625
[SUOMI] Then we've basically
been at war with ourselves?

192
00:10:59,708 --> 00:11:02,166
[FUDO] Both still
entwined, like lovers...

193
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:04,458
Hewn so by quantum
entanglement...

194
00:11:04,541 --> 00:11:07,291
Or perhaps,
by the hand of god...

195
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:09,625
Such is the fate of
worlds in collusion...

196
00:11:09,708 --> 00:11:12,041
Both unaware of
their attachment...

197
00:11:12,125 --> 00:11:14,500
Unaware they fight out of love.

198
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:20,416
[FUDO] So sayeth the
Book of Twin Stars!

199
00:11:24,666 --> 00:11:27,625
[ZESSICA] Altair would do
anything to rejoin with Vega...

200
00:11:27,708 --> 00:11:30,791
Just like I would do
anything to be with Amata...

201
00:11:30,875 --> 00:11:33,291
[SHRADE] Two worlds,
bound by Fate...

202
00:11:33,375 --> 00:11:34,750
[SHRADE coughs]

203
00:11:34,833 --> 00:11:36,000
[AMATA] You okay?!

204
00:11:36,458 --> 00:11:37,791
[SHRADE] You may
not believe it...

205
00:11:37,875 --> 00:11:40,583
...but I'm better
than I have been in years...

206
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:43,083
My last melody's
coming into focus...

207
00:11:43,166 --> 00:11:46,750
All my years of searching
at last come to fruition...

208
00:11:46,833 --> 00:11:49,208
[SHRADE] Two lost
worlds serenading

209
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:51,416
their heartache
for one another...

210
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:54,791
Contrary, but scintillating
odes to love...

211
00:11:54,875 --> 00:11:57,333
Paeans to cosmic longing...

212
00:11:57,416 --> 00:11:59,833
[AMATA] Shrade...
What are you saying?

213
00:11:59,916 --> 00:12:02,166
[SHRADE] I'm saying
they need each other...

214
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:06,375
Their music is in fragments;
only making sense as a whole.

215
00:12:07,833 --> 00:12:10,625
[FUDO] Eons passed,
and Pollon's second form

216
00:12:10,708 --> 00:12:14,208
reincarnated again-
into something new...

217
00:12:14,291 --> 00:12:18,583
A soul born of the
songstress, Alicia.

218
00:12:19,833 --> 00:12:21,125
[FUDO] However!

219
00:12:24,083 --> 00:12:25,833
[FUDO] Carried on wings
of shadow and hate,

220
00:12:25,916 --> 00:12:27,875
another manifested himself.

221
00:12:27,958 --> 00:12:31,750
And with him, the
painful memories of all.

222
00:12:32,458 --> 00:12:33,541
[SUOMI] Donar!

223
00:12:33,625 --> 00:12:35,375
[DONAR] What the hell...?!
What is this?!

224
00:12:35,458 --> 00:12:38,750
[MIKAGE] First betrayed,
then deceived...

225
00:12:38,833 --> 00:12:43,000
Bereft of love twice
by he who lies...!

226
00:12:43,083 --> 00:12:46,458
I will have my revenge...!

227
00:12:46,541 --> 00:12:50,000
I. Will. Have. My. Revenge!

228
00:12:50,583 --> 00:12:51,708
[FUDO] An so...

229
00:12:51,791 --> 00:12:54,750
In disgust he cleft
Alicia's child in twain,

230
00:12:54,833 --> 00:12:56,541
and sowed the
halves as instruments

231
00:12:56,625 --> 00:12:58,791
of his planned retribution.

232
00:12:59,958 --> 00:13:00,916
[ZESSICA] Amata!

233
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,375
Is what we're
seeing really true?!

234
00:13:04,166 --> 00:13:06,458
[FUDO] And though
Apollo's soul was divided...

235
00:13:06,541 --> 00:13:09,416
the spirit of Celiane
maintained a single shape

236
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:13,708
after the era of Silvia,
reborn into the present age.

237
00:13:13,791 --> 00:13:16,250
[YUNOHA] So one of us... is her?

238
00:13:16,333 --> 00:13:18,166
[FUDO] The inheritor of
Celiane's immortal soul

239
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:19,750
is among you...

240
00:13:19,833 --> 00:13:20,833
Look!

241
00:13:27,583 --> 00:13:28,708
[CAYENNE] Really?!

242
00:13:28,791 --> 00:13:30,125
[AMATA] Then it is her!

243
00:13:32,166 --> 00:13:33,458
[AMATA] Wait, Zess!

244
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:38,875
[ZESSICA] I guess
that means they

245
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:41,416
really are destined to
be together, huh...?

246
00:13:42,375 --> 00:13:43,625
Way to go...

247
00:13:43,708 --> 00:13:46,250
Once again, I'm the one
on the outside looking in.

248
00:13:47,875 --> 00:13:50,666
[FUDO] A world torn asunder
by an unrequited love...

249
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:54,166
The soul of a loyal
companion cloven in two...

250
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:57,416
A tragedy of cosmic proportions.

251
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:00,708
[CREA] But this tragedy
has an architect...

252
00:14:00,791 --> 00:14:02,208
Their adversary...

253
00:14:02,291 --> 00:14:05,291
A soul haunted since
time out of mind,

254
00:14:05,375 --> 00:14:07,791
by memories of
love cruelly betrayed.

255
00:14:08,375 --> 00:14:10,125
[FUDO] Toma's
darkness solidified,

256
00:14:10,208 --> 00:14:12,208
invested itself
anew into this era,

257
00:14:12,291 --> 00:14:13,875
and called itself...

258
00:14:14,583 --> 00:14:16,375
[FUDO] Mikage.

259
00:14:16,458 --> 00:14:18,458
[FUDO] But if the end
of this saga of love

260
00:14:18,541 --> 00:14:20,083
and betrayal is to be happy...

261
00:14:20,166 --> 00:14:21,875
It must be written by you!

262
00:14:23,708 --> 00:14:25,458
[FUDO] This, ladies and
gentlemen, is the extent

263
00:14:25,541 --> 00:14:27,666
of what I'm able
to share with you.

264
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:29,000
[CAYENNE] Hold on one second!

265
00:14:29,083 --> 00:14:30,250
After all that baloney,

266
00:14:30,333 --> 00:14:32,500
you don't know how the
friggin' story ends...?!

267
00:14:32,583 --> 00:14:35,166
At least tell us that this
stupid war gets put to bed!

268
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:37,666
Please! I can't take this!

269
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:39,541
[FUDO] I'll show you what I can.

270
00:14:44,833 --> 00:14:46,541
[CAYENNE] Oh, come on!

271
00:14:47,833 --> 00:14:49,500
[CAYENNE] What's
this supposed to mean?!

272
00:14:49,583 --> 00:14:50,916
[FUDO] These leaves
are waiting patiently...

273
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,875
For the future, children,
is never written in stone!

274
00:15:18,291 --> 00:15:19,750
[MIKONO] It's you...

275
00:15:19,833 --> 00:15:21,416
[KAGURA] Good. You're awake...

276
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:23,458
I was starting to
freak out a little.

277
00:15:25,791 --> 00:15:28,458
[KAGURA] What's wrong?
Are you hurt?

278
00:15:28,541 --> 00:15:29,750
[MIKONO] No...

279
00:15:29,833 --> 00:15:33,125
[KAGURA] Then--
why're you crying?

280
00:15:33,916 --> 00:15:37,791
[MIKONO] Because...
I can finally say I'm sorry.

281
00:15:39,083 --> 00:15:41,083
[MIKONO] I don't think...

282
00:15:41,166 --> 00:15:44,500
I don't think I ever realized
what all this did to you...

283
00:15:44,583 --> 00:15:46,541
How you felt.

284
00:15:52,666 --> 00:15:55,041
[SHRADE] At last,
I have found you.

285
00:16:00,041 --> 00:16:03,083
[SHRADE] I've been waiting
my entire life to hear this...

286
00:16:03,166 --> 00:16:05,875
To know the music of
worlds in collusion...

287
00:16:05,958 --> 00:16:08,166
How indescribably beautiful.

288
00:16:09,083 --> 00:16:11,458
[SHRADE] This is
not purgatory...

289
00:16:11,541 --> 00:16:14,875
This-- is a place of healing.

290
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:17,625
A place where
new music can soar.

291
00:16:25,708 --> 00:16:27,916
[SHRADE] Let it ring!

292
00:16:28,541 --> 00:16:34,083
[piano music]

293
00:16:34,166 --> 00:16:35,208
[AMATA] What are you doing?!

294
00:16:35,291 --> 00:16:36,875
[ZESSICA] You don't
have the strength!

295
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:44,458
[SHRADE]
This, cherished friends,

296
00:16:44,541 --> 00:16:46,833
is my farewell performance...

297
00:16:46,916 --> 00:16:50,625
Aquarion's grand sonata
forged from thin air...!

298
00:16:50,708 --> 00:16:54,666
A song of new beginnings...
of infinite renewal!

299
00:17:03,458 --> 00:17:05,291
[SHRADE] To dream
is to write one's life

300
00:17:05,375 --> 00:17:07,125
as if on a staff...

301
00:17:07,208 --> 00:17:10,375
To live is to commit
that staff to the air...!

302
00:17:10,458 --> 00:17:13,708
To let it unfold,
for all eternity!

303
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:24,583
[SHRADE] This music...

304
00:17:24,666 --> 00:17:27,291
I dedicate to the ones I love...

305
00:17:27,375 --> 00:17:31,416
Please allow me...
to express my gratitude.

306
00:17:34,208 --> 00:17:35,583
[AMATA] Shrade, stop it!

307
00:18:13,583 --> 00:18:15,291
[AMATA] Damn you, Shrade!

308
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,125
[SHRADE] You heard it, yes...?

309
00:18:25,208 --> 00:18:27,708
My song...? My...

310
00:18:30,083 --> 00:18:35,833
[gentle piano music]

311
00:18:35,916 --> 00:18:42,208
[crying sounds]

312
00:18:42,291 --> 00:18:45,333
[DONAR] The hell's
gotten into you?

313
00:18:45,416 --> 00:18:46,375
[CAYENNE] Nothing...

314
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:48,166
[CREA] I... feel it, too.

315
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:49,333
[CAYENNE] What?

316
00:18:49,416 --> 00:18:51,333
[CREA] And I share
your grief, Cayenne...

317
00:18:51,416 --> 00:18:54,375
Far more profoundly
than you may believe.

318
00:18:56,958 --> 00:19:00,166
[FUDO] Oft times are legends
writ in the lifeblood of heroes.

319
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:01,541
[SUOMI] Oh, dear...

320
00:19:01,625 --> 00:19:03,000
[FUDO] Another
verse in the ode...

321
00:19:03,083 --> 00:19:07,166
Another... mark... in the
annals of star-crossed love.

322
00:19:21,125 --> 00:19:24,000
[ZESSICA] Amata...?
Where are you?!

323
00:19:25,791 --> 00:19:27,625
[ZESSICA] Amata!

324
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,958
[MIKAGE] Your debt
has come due, my child.

325
00:19:35,041 --> 00:19:36,875
[ZESSICA] Wha-- No, wait--!

326
00:19:46,666 --> 00:19:49,708
[MIKAGE] Love and
sleep be thy master.

327
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:09,916
[MIKAGE] Oh my...

328
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,375
Such a marvelous thing is the
sweetness of flesh and bone.

329
00:20:13,083 --> 00:20:15,833
[ZESSICA] No...! That's not me!

330
00:20:15,916 --> 00:20:18,500
You bastard!
What have you done?!

331
00:20:18,583 --> 00:20:20,083
[MIKAGE] What have I done...?

332
00:20:20,166 --> 00:20:22,375
I've made a
vessel of you, girl--

333
00:20:22,458 --> 00:20:25,750
a barge on which to
sail my millennial dreams.

334
00:20:27,041 --> 00:20:28,958
[ZESSICA] Give me back my body!

335
00:20:29,041 --> 00:20:31,791
[MIKAGE] Oh, but we had a deal.

336
00:20:33,208 --> 00:20:35,041
[ZESSICA] Who are you?!

337
00:20:35,125 --> 00:20:37,458
[MIKAGE] A dweller in shadows...

338
00:20:37,541 --> 00:20:40,333
the wreckage--of betrayal.

339
00:20:41,375 --> 00:20:42,541
[MIKAGE] Be grateful...

340
00:20:42,625 --> 00:20:44,541
Wingless Ones
seldom host the spirit

341
00:20:44,625 --> 00:20:47,125
of their rightful overlords.

342
00:20:58,041 --> 00:20:59,041
[KAGURA] Reversal!

343
00:21:04,041 --> 00:21:06,750
[IZUMO] There's nowhere
left for you to run, Kagura.

344
00:21:06,833 --> 00:21:08,208
Surrender the True Eve
and be done

345
00:21:08,291 --> 00:21:10,166
with this ridiculous game!

346
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:12,708
[KAGURA] To hell
with you, old man!

347
00:21:12,791 --> 00:21:15,375
The rancid bitch
belongs to me...!

348
00:21:15,458 --> 00:21:18,250
You can have her
over my dead body!

349
00:21:18,333 --> 00:21:19,458
[ZESSICA] Mikono!

350
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:22,625
[MIKONO] Zessica?

351
00:21:22,708 --> 00:21:24,333
[ZESSICA] I know
what needs be done!

352
00:21:24,416 --> 00:21:26,458
[ZESSICA] Altair's
never going to stop

353
00:21:26,541 --> 00:21:28,500
until we kill their leader!

354
00:21:28,583 --> 00:21:29,791
Call Solar Wing!

355
00:21:29,875 --> 00:21:31,000
[MIKONO] What do you mean?

356
00:21:31,083 --> 00:21:33,500
[ZESSICA] Damn it...!
Summon him!

357
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:35,708
Solar Wing is our
only chance now!

358
00:21:35,791 --> 00:21:37,625
[KAGURA] Are you...
talkin' to me?

359
00:21:37,708 --> 00:21:39,125
[ZESSICA] You share
a soul with the man

360
00:21:39,208 --> 00:21:41,250
who piloted him in ages past!

361
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:44,416
[MIKAGE] If not you, who then?

362
00:21:48,166 --> 00:21:52,958
[KAGURA] A-qua-ri-on!

363
00:22:07,791 --> 00:22:09,375
[KAGURA] Holy crap. It worked.

364
00:22:33,916 --> 00:22:35,708
[IZUMO] Damn you, Solar Wing!

365
00:22:35,791 --> 00:22:39,041
[IZUMO] You dare
deny me my prize?!

366
00:22:43,166 --> 00:22:44,500
[MIKAGE] Which chord
in the final cadence

367
00:22:44,583 --> 00:22:46,916
shall this be, old friend...?

368
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,125
Or has the coda
changed yet again?

369
00:24:23,291 --> 00:24:24,916
[IZUMO] Close your eyes...

370
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,500
Let memory carry you back

371
00:24:26,583 --> 00:24:29,000
to some distant,
tranquil morning...

372
00:24:29,083 --> 00:24:32,541
I'll keep watch
while you dream...

373
00:24:32,625 --> 00:24:34,541
Life is pain, yes,

374
00:24:34,625 --> 00:24:37,000
but we will always have slumber.
