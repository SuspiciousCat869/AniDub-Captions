1
00:00:17,125 --> 00:00:18,541
[CIERRO] Reports
of fault-line upsets

2
00:00:18,625 --> 00:00:21,250
and record-breaking global
weather are still rolling in!

3
00:00:21,333 --> 00:00:24,166
[CREA] Now that the Legendary
Aquarion's seal is broken,

4
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:27,000
the whole planet is being
thrown into utter chaos.

5
00:00:27,083 --> 00:00:30,208
[DONAR] And we can't make
contact with the Elements...!

6
00:00:30,291 --> 00:00:33,458
Our only option is sending
every machine we have to Altair!

7
00:00:33,541 --> 00:00:35,125
[SUOMI] But how are
we going to do that?!

8
00:00:35,208 --> 00:00:37,333
The dimension gate
has already been closed!

9
00:00:37,416 --> 00:00:40,208
[ANDY] Let me punch
a hole through it.

10
00:00:40,291 --> 00:00:42,125
[ANDY] I know Shrade's
not here to help,...

11
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:44,958
and I know it was kind
of an accident last time...

12
00:00:45,041 --> 00:00:47,875
But I did it once.
I know I can do it again!

13
00:00:47,958 --> 00:00:49,291
[CAYENNE] Andy... You're sure?

14
00:00:49,375 --> 00:00:50,791
[ANDY] Damn right I am...!

15
00:00:50,875 --> 00:00:53,541
If I can't, then every hole
I've dug's been for nothing.

16
00:00:53,625 --> 00:00:55,875
Please, you gotta let me try!

17
00:00:58,666 --> 00:01:00,666
[CREA] Dig, Andy W. Hall...

18
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:02,833
Dig like you've
never dug before.

19
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:25,250
[IZUMO] Curse you, Solar Wing...

20
00:01:25,333 --> 00:01:27,250
You dare oppose me?

21
00:01:33,708 --> 00:01:36,125
[IZUMO] Our only goal is
to secure the True Eve...

22
00:01:36,208 --> 00:01:38,333
Do your best to
avoid the core units.

23
00:01:38,416 --> 00:01:40,166
Disable his artillery!

24
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:46,583
[KAGURA] Good luck with that...!

25
00:01:46,666 --> 00:01:49,000
Nothin' is gonna stop me!

26
00:02:07,958 --> 00:02:10,916
[IZUMO] So this is the power
wielded by Solar Wing...

27
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,250
Damn him!

28
00:02:18,166 --> 00:02:19,083
[IZUMO] With that
strength he could wipe out

29
00:02:19,166 --> 00:02:22,416
a Gnis platoon
in one fell swoop.

30
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:26,000
I'll send it back
at you, amplified!

31
00:02:26,083 --> 00:02:27,333
[MIKONO] Look out!

32
00:02:27,416 --> 00:02:29,708
[KAGURA] Guess he
forgot I can just reverse it!

33
00:02:34,583 --> 00:02:35,875
[IZUMO] It's not
affecting him at all...

34
00:02:35,958 --> 00:02:37,208
His reversal power is so potent

35
00:02:37,291 --> 00:02:38,791
it's canceling my attack!

36
00:02:38,875 --> 00:02:41,916
[KAGURA] Get it through
your head; she belongs to me!

37
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,416
[IZUMO] That's not
your decision...

38
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:44,583
Get ahold of yourself;

39
00:02:44,666 --> 00:02:46,625
what could she possibly
be worth to you?!

40
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:47,958
[KAGURA] We're meant
for each other...

41
00:02:48,041 --> 00:02:50,375
I'll die before
I let you take her!

42
00:02:50,458 --> 00:02:52,916
[IZUMO] A selfish
child as always!

43
00:02:53,875 --> 00:02:55,833
[MIX] Help has
arrived, Commander!

44
00:02:57,916 --> 00:03:02,458
[MIKONO] Wait a sec, is
that... No way...! Mix!

45
00:03:02,791 --> 00:03:07,291
[MIX] I fly with Izumo...

46
00:03:07,375 --> 00:03:09,541
He is the future of Altair.

47
00:03:12,333 --> 00:03:15,333
[SUOMI] Be safe...
Come back home to us.

48
00:03:26,958 --> 00:03:29,291
[MALLOY] Been a while since I've
merged with you guys!

49
00:03:29,958 --> 00:03:31,958
[CAYENNE] Get ready, the
target's coming up!

50
00:03:32,041 --> 00:03:33,250
[MALLOY] All right...

51
00:03:33,333 --> 00:03:35,208
Let's get this done quick
with a Brutal Merge!

52
00:03:35,291 --> 00:03:37,125
[CAYENNE] That's not
gonna cut it this time!

53
00:03:37,208 --> 00:03:40,125
[CAYENNE] We need a
Hot-Blooded Warrior Merge!

54
00:03:40,208 --> 00:03:40,875
[MALLOY] Go!

55
00:03:40,958 --> 00:03:43,208
[ANDY] Aquarion!

56
00:03:48,833 --> 00:03:51,916
[ANDY] Aquarion... Gepard!

57
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:03,916
[ANDY] Mix...

58
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,250
I don't care what's happened,

59
00:04:05,333 --> 00:04:06,875
or what your body looks
like, I'm coming for you,

60
00:04:06,958 --> 00:04:09,666
and nothing anyone
can do will stop me!

61
00:04:12,083 --> 00:04:14,791
[ANDY] C'mon... Haven't
I told you this before?

62
00:04:14,875 --> 00:04:15,875
It's simple...

63
00:04:15,958 --> 00:04:16,875
The reason holes are made is

64
00:04:16,958 --> 00:04:19,291
to bring people closer together.

65
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,500
[ANDY] Well I'm digging
this one 'cause right now,

66
00:04:21,583 --> 00:04:23,833
it's the only chance
I have to get to you.

67
00:04:23,916 --> 00:04:24,750
And guess what...?

68
00:04:24,833 --> 00:04:25,958
Once I find you,

69
00:04:26,041 --> 00:04:27,625
I'll dig another one
straight to your heart!

70
00:04:27,708 --> 00:04:31,750
[ANDY] A hole so big
I can bury myself in it!

71
00:04:53,083 --> 00:04:54,875
[CIERRO] I... I think
we've got an opening!

72
00:04:54,958 --> 00:04:57,916
[DONAR] Get in there
n' give 'em hell!

73
00:05:07,083 --> 00:05:10,166
[ANDY] I'm on my way,
don't give up, Mix!

74
00:05:11,666 --> 00:05:12,625
[MIX] What was that...?

75
00:05:12,708 --> 00:05:15,083
Did somebody just say something?

76
00:05:15,166 --> 00:05:19,000
No...! Must be losing my mind--

77
00:05:26,166 --> 00:05:27,208
[KAGURA] Take that!

78
00:05:27,291 --> 00:05:28,458
[MIKONO] Please stop!

79
00:05:28,541 --> 00:05:30,125
I know the person
piloting that machine...!

80
00:05:30,208 --> 00:05:32,166
That's Mix, she's my friend!

81
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:33,625
[KAGURA] Your friend?

82
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:35,333
[ZESSICA] Behind us!

83
00:05:40,916 --> 00:05:42,833
[ZESSICA] Damn you... Izumo.

84
00:05:44,791 --> 00:05:46,166
[MIKONO] Amata.

85
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:57,958
[ALICIA] Amata.

86
00:05:59,708 --> 00:06:00,750
[ALICIA] Amata!

87
00:06:02,791 --> 00:06:05,000
[AMATA] Who's there?

88
00:06:05,791 --> 00:06:08,916
[ALICIA] Amata... Amata!

89
00:06:18,958 --> 00:06:20,541
[AMATA] Where am I?

90
00:06:20,625 --> 00:06:22,083
[ALICIA] Amata.

91
00:06:33,458 --> 00:06:34,708
[KAGURA] Stay outta this!

92
00:06:36,833 --> 00:06:38,083
[KAGURA] Reversal!

93
00:06:38,958 --> 00:06:40,083
[MIX] Commander Izumo!

94
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:44,041
[KAGURA] This "friend" of yours
is a pain in the ass!

95
00:06:49,541 --> 00:06:50,958
[KAGURA] Crush you!

96
00:06:51,041 --> 00:06:52,208
[MIKONO] Don't hurt her!

97
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,583
[MIX] Where did they come from?!

98
00:06:59,208 --> 00:07:00,208
[KAGURA] The hell?

99
00:07:00,291 --> 00:07:01,916
[MIKONO] Wait,
that's Aquarion Gepard!

100
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,166
[MALLOY] It looks like we landed
right in the middle of it, huh?

101
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:06,458
[CAYENNE] Two Abductors
and the Legendary Aquarion,

102
00:07:06,541 --> 00:07:08,000
but who's piloting 'em?

103
00:07:08,083 --> 00:07:10,083
[MIKONO] Cayenne...?
Is that you in there?!

104
00:07:10,166 --> 00:07:13,250
[CAYENNE] Mikono...?!
Why are you with them?!

105
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:14,416
[ANDY] Mix!

106
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,791
[ANDY] Mix is in that
machine, you guys!

107
00:07:16,875 --> 00:07:18,041
[CAYENNE] What
the hell's going on?

108
00:07:18,125 --> 00:07:19,416
Someone talk to me!

109
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,416
[ZESSICA] Both of those
Abductors are after Mikono,

110
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:22,833
you have to stop them!

111
00:07:22,916 --> 00:07:24,458
[CAYENNE] Tell me where
Amata and Shrade are!

112
00:07:24,541 --> 00:07:27,208
[ZESSICA] Unfortunately,
we lost track of Amata...

113
00:07:27,291 --> 00:07:30,041
And I'm sorry... Shrade is gone.

114
00:07:31,375 --> 00:07:32,666
[ZESSICA] He played
out his final song

115
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:34,500
in the dimensional rift.

116
00:07:37,541 --> 00:07:40,041
[CAYENNE] So...
that's what that was...

117
00:07:54,166 --> 00:07:55,791
[CAYENNE] He's really gone.

118
00:07:57,958 --> 00:08:00,083
[MIX] All who oppose
Izumo must die!

119
00:08:00,166 --> 00:08:01,708
[ANDY] I don't
"oppose" anything...!

120
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:03,958
All I want is to take
you back with me!

121
00:08:04,041 --> 00:08:05,125
[MIX] Take me back where?

122
00:08:05,208 --> 00:08:06,916
[ANDY] Back home
where you belong...

123
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:07,916
You know me...

124
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,250
Don't you remember
Andy W. Hall?!

125
00:08:14,375 --> 00:08:16,916
[MIX] Whoever the hell you
are just leave me alone!

126
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,333
[ANDY] Mix, no!

127
00:08:22,458 --> 00:08:24,083
[IZUMO] How can you
remain so selfish...?

128
00:08:24,166 --> 00:08:26,958
Altair is your home,
do you truly not give a damn?!

129
00:08:27,041 --> 00:08:28,833
[KAGURA] That's your
home old man, not mine...!

130
00:08:28,916 --> 00:08:30,750
All I care about
is my Silvie...!

131
00:08:30,833 --> 00:08:33,666
You and your decrepit
planet can go straight to hell!

132
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:37,500
[KAGURA] I'll fight the
world before I quit her...

133
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:40,458
Even if it means I die trying!

134
00:08:40,541 --> 00:08:43,333
[ANDY] Stop it, Mix...! It's me!

135
00:08:44,583 --> 00:08:46,916
[IZUMO] All this over
a single Igura...

136
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,708
...a mere woman.

137
00:08:51,375 --> 00:08:53,208
[IZUMO] Alicia.

138
00:09:01,125 --> 00:09:02,416
[AMATA] This is it...

139
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:05,416
This is where the voice
is calling out to me from.

140
00:09:05,833 --> 00:09:07,500
[ALICIA] Amata!

141
00:09:29,166 --> 00:09:31,291
[AMATA] Mom, it's you...

142
00:09:32,583 --> 00:09:33,958
[ALICIA] Amata.

143
00:09:40,541 --> 00:09:42,958
[FUDO] A true miracle
is about to occur...

144
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:45,708
The planet, the land
and the life that sleeps

145
00:09:45,791 --> 00:09:48,208
within it are all
about to awaken.

146
00:09:48,291 --> 00:09:50,208
[FUDO] The rebirth of Solar Wing

147
00:09:50,291 --> 00:09:52,833
was a double-edged sword.

148
00:09:52,916 --> 00:09:55,500
[FUDO] Will it divide
the world into factions

149
00:09:55,583 --> 00:09:57,000
of bitter opposition...?

150
00:09:57,083 --> 00:09:59,625
Or unite us all in
a single embrace?

151
00:10:09,583 --> 00:10:11,583
[ANDY] Please Mix... Come home!

152
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:15,125
[MIX] Spacial Augmentation!

153
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:18,291
[MALLOY] Not again!

154
00:10:18,375 --> 00:10:20,041
[CAYENNE] How long are you
going to keep this up, Andy?

155
00:10:20,125 --> 00:10:21,958
[ANDY] As long as it
takes to get her back...!

156
00:10:22,041 --> 00:10:23,583
I make the holes
and she fills 'em in!

157
00:10:23,666 --> 00:10:25,666
[ANDY] That's how
we've always done it,

158
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:27,791
and that's how we're
always gonna do it...!

159
00:10:27,875 --> 00:10:29,708
Just like when we first met...

160
00:10:29,791 --> 00:10:31,916
And when I realized
I was in love!

161
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,250
[MIX] Jackass...

162
00:10:40,333 --> 00:10:42,583
Why does he keep doing the
same move over and over?

163
00:10:42,666 --> 00:10:45,250
And why is this all so familiar?

164
00:10:47,708 --> 00:10:54,083
[ALICIA] Amata... I've waited so
long to see you.

165
00:10:54,166 --> 00:10:56,500
[ALICIA] Look at how
much you've grown.

166
00:10:59,041 --> 00:11:01,125
[AMATA] Why'd you abandon me?

167
00:11:01,208 --> 00:11:02,750
I had nothing!

168
00:11:02,833 --> 00:11:06,833
I was just a kid and you
left me to fend for myself.

169
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:09,583
[AMATA] And now you're just
laying there...

170
00:11:09,666 --> 00:11:12,125
...making small talk?

171
00:11:14,041 --> 00:11:15,250
[ALICIA] Amata.

172
00:11:18,875 --> 00:11:21,500
[ALICIA] I've no right to ask
your forgiveness...

173
00:11:21,583 --> 00:11:23,625
But there is something
you must know...

174
00:11:23,708 --> 00:11:26,166
Something crucial.

175
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:27,666
[ALICIA] You deserve
to know the reason

176
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:29,541
I had to leave you...

177
00:11:29,625 --> 00:11:34,000
And the truth... about
the man who sired you.

178
00:11:36,458 --> 00:11:40,166
[ALICIA] He wasn't
from Vega as you and I.

179
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:42,833
[ALICIA] He's the
Commander of Altair...

180
00:11:42,916 --> 00:11:45,125
Izumo Kamurogi.

181
00:11:49,958 --> 00:11:52,333
[AMATA] Please tell
me you're joking.

182
00:11:57,208 --> 00:11:59,791
[IZUMO] I am just as
resolute as you are...!

183
00:11:59,875 --> 00:12:01,375
You will not win!

184
00:12:01,458 --> 00:12:03,500
I will put an end to
the Curse of Eve

185
00:12:03,583 --> 00:12:06,000
and rid Altair of this tragedy!

186
00:12:06,458 --> 00:12:08,125
[ALICIA] It's true.

187
00:12:08,208 --> 00:12:11,041
Your father came to Vega
in search of a woman

188
00:12:11,125 --> 00:12:12,166
who was strong enough

189
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:15,375
to withstand
inter-dimensional travel.

190
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:17,875
[ALICIA] When I first met him,

191
00:12:17,958 --> 00:12:19,750
I was working as an actress.

192
00:13:10,041 --> 00:13:13,458
[IZUMO] My vessel malfunctioned
and I crash-landed on Vega...

193
00:13:13,541 --> 00:13:15,583
She saved my life.

194
00:13:15,666 --> 00:13:18,166
[IZUMO] From the
moment I first saw her,

195
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:20,458
I knew Alicia was the one...

196
00:13:20,541 --> 00:13:25,041
She was the Rare Igura we'd
been searching for... But...

197
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:30,625
[ALICIA] We were also
the missing pieces

198
00:13:30,708 --> 00:13:33,166
to one another's souls.

199
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:35,083
[ALICIA] It was destiny.

200
00:13:47,833 --> 00:13:50,708
[IZUMO] I suppose I'm in
no position to judge Kagura...

201
00:13:50,791 --> 00:13:52,750
I've been there myself...

202
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:57,500
I was ready to let Altair perish
for the love of one woman.

203
00:13:57,583 --> 00:13:59,666
[IZUMO] I kept her a
secret from command,

204
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:01,000
and returned to
Altair in the hope

205
00:14:01,083 --> 00:14:03,708
that everything
would work itself out...

206
00:14:03,791 --> 00:14:07,166
But... Mikage
could not be fooled.

207
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,458
[ALICIA] He came back...

208
00:14:17,541 --> 00:14:20,583
...several years later,
but by then,

209
00:14:20,666 --> 00:14:22,833
you were already a toddler.

210
00:14:22,916 --> 00:14:23,875
And then...

211
00:14:23,958 --> 00:14:25,541
The day finally came
when your father

212
00:14:25,625 --> 00:14:29,708
told me the whole truth...
about the Curse of Eve.

213
00:14:30,791 --> 00:14:31,625
[ALICIA] I'll go.

214
00:14:31,708 --> 00:14:32,791
[IZUMO] Are you sure...?

215
00:14:32,875 --> 00:14:34,291
We have no idea what will happen

216
00:14:34,375 --> 00:14:37,500
to a Rare Igura there...
It's dangerous!

217
00:14:37,583 --> 00:14:38,583
[ALICIA] If it helps you,

218
00:14:38,666 --> 00:14:39,833
I don't care that
it's dangerous...

219
00:14:39,916 --> 00:14:41,875
I'm a hundred percent sure.

220
00:14:43,291 --> 00:14:45,208
[IZUMO] Alicia.

221
00:14:51,583 --> 00:14:52,916
[ALICIA] I agonized over whether

222
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,125
or not I should bring you...
but I couldn't...

223
00:14:56,208 --> 00:14:57,500
Because if you
couldn't withstand

224
00:14:57,583 --> 00:14:59,375
the interdimensional travel--

225
00:14:59,458 --> 00:15:01,916
or if something
terrible befell you--

226
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,083
I never could've
forgiven myself.

227
00:15:05,166 --> 00:15:06,708
[ALICIA] When I left you,

228
00:15:06,791 --> 00:15:10,666
I never imagined we'd
be apart for so long...

229
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:13,291
I know that excuse
rings hollow now...

230
00:15:13,375 --> 00:15:16,750
Nothing changes the fact
that I abandoned you.

231
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:20,125
I wanted to help save the
man I love's home world...

232
00:15:20,208 --> 00:15:22,250
in honor of what he meant to me.

233
00:15:34,375 --> 00:15:35,791
[AMATA] For all these years...

234
00:15:35,875 --> 00:15:38,083
I've resented you.

235
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,416
[AMATA] But that's
over now. I'm done...

236
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:49,291
[AMATA] The real truth is...

237
00:15:49,375 --> 00:15:53,500
I hated myself back
then... I was weak.

238
00:15:53,583 --> 00:15:56,458
You were brave enough to go
after the person you loved.

239
00:15:56,541 --> 00:15:59,458
But not me...
All I did was stand there.

240
00:16:01,875 --> 00:16:05,625
[AMATA] I hope you
can forgive me... Mother.

241
00:16:07,041 --> 00:16:08,875
[ALICIA] Amata.

242
00:16:23,875 --> 00:16:25,833
[KAGURA] Just give
it up already, Izumo!

243
00:16:25,916 --> 00:16:27,833
[IZUMO] I will never
surrender, Kagura...!

244
00:16:27,916 --> 00:16:30,875
I refuse to let Alicia's
sacrifice be in vain!

245
00:16:32,416 --> 00:16:34,583
[AMATA] The Legendary
Aquarion is fighting?!

246
00:16:34,666 --> 00:16:36,166
[ALICIA] They both
want the girl...

247
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:38,416
Izumo and the other you.

248
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:40,041
[AMATA] Damn it! Kagura!

249
00:16:41,916 --> 00:16:43,375
[IZUMO] Come to me, Iron Sea ...

250
00:16:43,458 --> 00:16:46,291
Fill me with the power
I need to destroy him!

251
00:17:01,958 --> 00:17:03,000
[MALLOY] Red strings...?

252
00:17:03,083 --> 00:17:04,250
What the hell is this?!

253
00:17:04,333 --> 00:17:06,833
[MIX] He's harnessing
all of Altair's power...

254
00:17:06,916 --> 00:17:09,375
And he's channeling
it into the Ahura Gnis!

255
00:17:17,916 --> 00:17:19,250
[IZUMO] Altair Cannon.

256
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:31,416
[IZUMO] Fire.

257
00:17:33,208 --> 00:17:34,125
[KAGURA] Hang on.

258
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:47,000
[ZESSICA] That blast
contained the sum power

259
00:17:47,083 --> 00:17:49,916
of the entire planet Altair...

260
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,166
[MIKAGE] How could you, Izumo?

261
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:58,458
[IZUMO] Consider that
one a warning shot...

262
00:17:58,541 --> 00:18:01,375
Hand over the one
True Eve at once...

263
00:18:01,458 --> 00:18:03,791
Or the next one's
between your eyes!

264
00:18:06,666 --> 00:18:07,791
[MIKONO] Zessica?

265
00:18:08,458 --> 00:18:09,416
[KAGURA] What the hell?

266
00:18:18,833 --> 00:18:20,250
[IZUMO] Alicia, no!

267
00:18:27,666 --> 00:18:29,125
[AMATA] Mother, no!

268
00:18:34,166 --> 00:18:35,250
[AMATA] No...

269
00:18:39,458 --> 00:18:42,250
[AMATA] Kagura!

270
00:18:42,333 --> 00:18:44,958
[IZUMO] Alicia!

271
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:46,208
[KAGURA] What happened?

272
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:47,583
[ZESSICA] It's time.

273
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:59,708
[KAGURA] Here it comes...
Genesis Infinity... Punch!

274
00:19:08,666 --> 00:19:11,416
[MIKAGE] Farewell, friend...
Time to say goodbye.

275
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:29,500
[IZUMO] Such immense power...

276
00:19:29,583 --> 00:19:33,333
Mikage... This was
all your doing!

277
00:19:35,291 --> 00:19:36,625
[KAGURA] No!

278
00:19:42,333 --> 00:19:44,125
[KAGURA] Silvie!

279
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:19,125
[IZUMO] Alicia.

280
00:20:20,458 --> 00:20:21,791
[AMATA] Easy...

281
00:20:23,208 --> 00:20:25,166
[IZUMO] It's you.

282
00:20:30,166 --> 00:20:33,041
[AMATA] I talked
to her... to Mom...

283
00:20:33,125 --> 00:20:35,666
She told me the truth
about who you are.

284
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:37,583
[IZUMO] I see.

285
00:20:43,583 --> 00:20:45,500
[IZUMO] Take me to Alicia...

286
00:20:45,583 --> 00:20:47,666
I must see her once more.

287
00:20:53,583 --> 00:20:56,375
[IZUMO] I know I cannot
ask your forgiveness...

288
00:20:56,458 --> 00:20:58,916
I took your mother
away from you...

289
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,166
But I am truly sorry.

290
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:08,416
[AMATA] What are--?

291
00:21:08,875 --> 00:21:10,708
[IZUMO] Mayflies...

292
00:21:10,791 --> 00:21:13,166
I've only seen them once...

293
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:15,000
When I was little...

294
00:21:15,791 --> 00:21:17,291
[IZUMO] They're extinct...

295
00:21:17,375 --> 00:21:20,458
Their females died
off decades ago...

296
00:21:20,541 --> 00:21:23,125
How in heaven's
name are they back?

297
00:21:29,958 --> 00:21:32,125
[IZUMO] We're in Area 337...

298
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:33,708
Where Iron Sea's malfunctions

299
00:21:33,791 --> 00:21:36,291
have been the most pronounced.

300
00:21:36,375 --> 00:21:41,750
Could it be... that Iron Sea
itself caused the--?

301
00:21:44,833 --> 00:21:46,833
[FUDO] Ever resourceful
Mother Gaia...

302
00:21:46,916 --> 00:21:49,041
Goddess of Fertility.

303
00:21:49,125 --> 00:21:51,416
The land that brings
forth the blessing

304
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:55,375
of the harvest is symbolized
by a feminine figure.

305
00:21:55,458 --> 00:21:57,833
[FUDO] Male and female...

306
00:21:57,916 --> 00:21:59,625
Plus and Minus...

307
00:21:59,708 --> 00:22:02,250
Every aspect of creation,
great or small,

308
00:22:02,333 --> 00:22:05,583
is ordered according
to these simple dualities.

309
00:22:05,666 --> 00:22:07,291
From people to land...

310
00:22:07,375 --> 00:22:10,708
From worlds to
the universe itself.

311
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:13,416
[IZUMO] Iron Sea functioned
by drawing energy

312
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:16,958
from the land; harnessing
its fertility...

313
00:22:17,041 --> 00:22:19,500
It was never the intention,
but I'm afraid in doing this,

314
00:22:19,583 --> 00:22:24,625
Iron Sea also compromised
the planet's ability to heal...

315
00:22:24,708 --> 00:22:26,250
If that's the case...

316
00:22:26,333 --> 00:22:29,666
Our hubris is at the
core of our suffering.

317
00:22:30,916 --> 00:22:33,833
[IZUMO] Which means
that everything I fought for...

318
00:22:33,916 --> 00:22:36,208
Was all for naught...

319
00:22:39,125 --> 00:22:42,041
[AMATA] No...
You can't leave me yet!

320
00:22:42,125 --> 00:22:45,916
Father! Father!

321
00:22:49,875 --> 00:22:52,583
[ALICIA] It wasn't for nothing.

322
00:22:57,666 --> 00:22:58,875
[AMATA] What is this?

323
00:23:03,375 --> 00:23:05,000
[IZUMO] Alicia.

324
00:23:05,583 --> 00:23:07,125
[ALICIA] Your life
meant something--

325
00:23:07,208 --> 00:23:08,416
it wasn't for naught...

326
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:12,000
Look, we made a son
together, and he's alive.

327
00:23:12,083 --> 00:23:15,625
He's not just the best of us,
he's the hope of two worlds.

328
00:23:18,541 --> 00:23:20,458
[ALICIA] Amata...

329
00:23:20,541 --> 00:23:23,916
You're the symbol of the
true love of your parents.

330
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,208
[ALICIA] But don't forget...

331
00:23:25,291 --> 00:23:27,458
You must seek love as well...

332
00:23:27,541 --> 00:23:29,500
Find the one...

333
00:23:29,583 --> 00:23:32,291
The one more precious
to you than anything.

334
00:23:34,708 --> 00:23:36,333
[AMATA] Mom, wait!

335
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:39,833
[AMATA] Don't go!

336
00:24:23,125 --> 00:24:24,333
[KAGURA] Silvie...

337
00:24:24,416 --> 00:24:26,083
You're my destiny...

338
00:24:26,166 --> 00:24:29,916
I know who you really are,
who I really am...

339
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,500
And I love you...!

340
00:24:31,583 --> 00:24:33,500
We belong together...!

341
00:24:33,583 --> 00:24:36,666
I want to wrap myself
around you for all eternity!
