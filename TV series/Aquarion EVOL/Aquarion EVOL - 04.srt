1
00:00:16,958 --> 00:00:19,250
Sad to say,
but despite our best efforts,

2
00:00:19,333 --> 00:00:22,666
no elemental power is in
evidence from Mikono thus far.

3
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:24,625
Yeah.

4
00:00:24,708 --> 00:00:28,541
I'm afraid the poor girl will
have to be sent home soon.

5
00:00:28,625 --> 00:00:30,375
Yeah.

6
00:00:30,458 --> 00:00:34,833
I prefer my ginger in the raw.
Pickled is far too pungent.

7
00:00:34,916 --> 00:00:36,083
Yeah.

8
00:00:38,166 --> 00:00:40,916
So, the Aquarion debacle...

9
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:44,833
Now that I have
your full attention...

10
00:00:44,916 --> 00:00:46,583
I've unearthed a few facts.

11
00:00:46,666 --> 00:00:50,041
The so-called "forbidden"
Aquarion formation

12
00:00:50,125 --> 00:00:52,708
was last in the
field nine years ago.

13
00:00:52,791 --> 00:00:56,666
The lead pilot was
one Donar Dantes.

14
00:00:57,291 --> 00:00:59,833
Why is "Aquarion"
a watchword for disaster?

15
00:00:59,916 --> 00:01:01,708
What happened out there?

16
00:01:03,208 --> 00:01:05,583
This wasn't elective surgery.

17
00:01:05,666 --> 00:01:08,625
There's a very good reason
the form was banned.

18
00:01:10,916 --> 00:01:12,166
That simulation yesterday...

19
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:13,250
Mm-hmm...

20
00:01:13,333 --> 00:01:15,250
I know, right?
Coolest. Thing. Ever.

21
00:01:15,333 --> 00:01:16,458
Wouldn't want to be the crew'

22
00:01:16,541 --> 00:01:17,750
who has to follow
that up, you know?

23
00:01:17,833 --> 00:01:19,583
Mm-hm... Yeah, I'm with you...

24
00:01:19,666 --> 00:01:20,583
Totally, but it might
be fun to try!

25
00:01:20,666 --> 00:01:22,916
I guess I'll never
see Amata again.

26
00:01:24,916 --> 00:01:27,083
He belongs to Aquarion now;

27
00:01:27,166 --> 00:01:30,500
one of the chosen...
like Cayenne.

28
00:01:32,208 --> 00:01:34,666
Not a world I really
have a place in.

29
00:01:35,875 --> 00:01:38,541
Spare me. Just like that, huh?

30
00:01:39,333 --> 00:01:40,500
What about your boy?

31
00:01:40,583 --> 00:01:41,666
What are you talking about?

32
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:43,833
Amata, or whatever his name is.

33
00:01:43,916 --> 00:01:46,541
Awkward guy?
You merged with him...

34
00:01:48,125 --> 00:01:49,166
I know who you mean.

35
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:51,166
Not still ticked
at him, are you?

36
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:53,500
Kinda ballsy, what
he pulled yesterday.

37
00:01:53,583 --> 00:01:56,916
C'mon; pretty sure
that counts as an apology.

38
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,708
I don't see how it's
any business of yours.

39
00:01:59,791 --> 00:02:03,041
Get over yourself, honey.

40
00:02:03,916 --> 00:02:07,750
"Po' widdle me; I'm no good
for anything,"--give it a break.

41
00:02:08,583 --> 00:02:10,166
That don't fly with me.

42
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:13,333
Here. 'Least say bye.

43
00:02:18,125 --> 00:02:19,625
G'bye.

44
00:04:04,166 --> 00:04:05,500
Oh, man.

45
00:04:05,583 --> 00:04:08,333
What's the actual chance
she got what I was going for?

46
00:04:08,416 --> 00:04:13,666
Nooooooo! My hole!
My path to salvation!

47
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:15,041
Andy?

48
00:04:16,541 --> 00:04:18,041
You're killin' me!

49
00:04:18,125 --> 00:04:20,791
How is it possible for you to
not have a single weak spot?!

50
00:04:20,875 --> 00:04:22,500
That the hole from yesterday?

51
00:04:22,583 --> 00:04:24,041
Somebody filled it in?

52
00:04:24,125 --> 00:04:27,708
Oh, dude, filled in? More
like plugged up elementally!

53
00:04:27,791 --> 00:04:28,750
Huh?

54
00:04:28,833 --> 00:04:30,291
Whoever did this
is yuckin' it up

55
00:04:30,375 --> 00:04:31,875
on the other side of the wall!

56
00:04:31,958 --> 00:04:33,666
Meaning the culprit's a chick!

57
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:35,000
That seems logical.

58
00:04:35,083 --> 00:04:37,666
Even worse, this particular
chick may just have

59
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:39,250
a heart of granite.

60
00:04:39,333 --> 00:04:40,916
Ah, but there's way more to it.

61
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,208
Truth is, deep down
she's waiting for me--

62
00:04:44,291 --> 00:04:46,791
tempting me to rescue her.

63
00:04:47,583 --> 00:04:48,625
Yes!

64
00:04:48,708 --> 00:04:50,666
Your challenge is
accepted, fair maid!

65
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:52,000
You are gonna hate life

66
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:54,416
if you find out one of
the guys was behind this.

67
00:05:01,333 --> 00:05:02,500
That song...

68
00:05:02,583 --> 00:05:06,083
Oh, you mean the eighty-eights?
That's Shrade.

69
00:05:06,166 --> 00:05:07,583
What's his story?

70
00:05:07,666 --> 00:05:10,625
Well, for starters, he's
like the academy's star pupil.

71
00:05:10,708 --> 00:05:12,333
Ridin' a full scholarship.

72
00:05:12,416 --> 00:05:14,000
You'll never see him
in training, though;'

73
00:05:14,083 --> 00:05:16,291
something about
his health, I think.

74
00:05:16,375 --> 00:05:18,666
But, word is, the ladies
can't get enough.

75
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:20,416
I've heard candid pics
of the guy are as good

76
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:24,666
as legal tender on the
flipside o' the ol' Berli-- Hey!

77
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:27,083
I was givin' you dirt! Rude!

78
00:05:27,958 --> 00:05:29,750
Apologies, young sir.

79
00:05:29,833 --> 00:05:31,791
Hey, wait up!

80
00:05:49,333 --> 00:05:50,666
Come in.

81
00:05:51,375 --> 00:05:53,333
Our bad. Sorry to interrupt.

82
00:05:53,416 --> 00:05:55,083
Perfectly fine, Andy.

83
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:06,041
My hat's off.

84
00:06:06,125 --> 00:06:09,083
Yesterday's simulation
produced the loveliest tone.

85
00:06:09,166 --> 00:06:11,500
I hope that doesn't
sound presumptuous.

86
00:06:11,583 --> 00:06:14,416
How'd you even
know this was him?

87
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:18,416
Let us say I am particularly
sensitive to new music.

88
00:06:19,833 --> 00:06:23,708
Silence creates melody.
Cuts it in relief, if you like.

89
00:06:23,791 --> 00:06:26,958
Just as what we don't
say frames what we do.

90
00:06:27,791 --> 00:06:30,708
Shrade, right?
My name's Amata Sora.

91
00:06:31,375 --> 00:06:32,916
Charmed, I'm sure.

92
00:06:33,458 --> 00:06:35,208
There you are!

93
00:06:37,375 --> 00:06:38,500
Cayenne!

94
00:06:38,583 --> 00:06:41,666
To what do I owe the
pleasure? Or do I dream?

95
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:43,958
Can it, poof!
I didn't come here for you.

96
00:06:44,041 --> 00:06:46,791
Me and this little walkin'
curtsy are due for a few words.

97
00:06:46,875 --> 00:06:48,541
What the hell were
you tryin' to pull?!

98
00:06:48,625 --> 00:06:50,416
If you wanted me to
bash in your damn skull,

99
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:51,541
all you had to do was ask!

100
00:06:51,625 --> 00:06:53,125
Cayenne!

101
00:06:53,208 --> 00:06:54,458
What did I do to you?!

102
00:06:54,541 --> 00:06:56,916
I really must insist you
not fight in front of me.

103
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,833
I detest dressing you down.

104
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:16,666
Damn it, Shrade!
This isn't your fight!

105
00:07:26,333 --> 00:07:31,666
Amata. Cayenne.
Take care, I'll miss you.

106
00:07:33,666 --> 00:07:35,083
Good bye.

107
00:07:36,458 --> 00:07:38,083
Mikono!

108
00:07:39,791 --> 00:07:41,166
Mikono!!

109
00:07:45,625 --> 00:07:47,333
Should we call somebody?

110
00:07:47,416 --> 00:07:48,625
Dude. That is seriously harsh.

111
00:07:48,708 --> 00:07:49,958
I will never get how being able

112
00:07:50,041 --> 00:07:52,791
to do that doesn't
ruffle your feathers.

113
00:07:52,875 --> 00:07:55,375
Take note, Red.
Shrade's thing is sound.

114
00:07:55,458 --> 00:07:59,833
Basically he uses it to bend
people's minds to his will.

115
00:08:00,666 --> 00:08:03,083
Simple when the mind
in question is chaos.

116
00:08:03,166 --> 00:08:07,708
So, Mikono again? I take it
she's still a source of anxiety?

117
00:08:14,625 --> 00:08:15,958
So much anger in you.

118
00:08:16,041 --> 00:08:18,875
Yeah, well you're the
sonofabitch mining for it!

119
00:08:19,375 --> 00:08:21,750
That's fair, I suppose.

120
00:08:23,458 --> 00:08:25,583
Dissonance breeds resolution.

121
00:08:31,291 --> 00:08:32,541
Attention all cadets:

122
00:08:32,625 --> 00:08:34,708
Abductors confirmed near
the Neo-Kowloon district.

123
00:08:34,791 --> 00:08:36,041
Jeez, you're kidding me.

124
00:08:36,125 --> 00:08:38,375
Bastards might as well
be right in our backyard.

125
00:08:39,666 --> 00:08:41,958
Elements Cayenne,
Andy and Amata:

126
00:08:42,041 --> 00:08:43,208
report for deployment
immediately.

127
00:08:43,291 --> 00:08:44,125
That can't be right!

128
00:08:44,208 --> 00:08:46,083
You heard 'em, DB!

129
00:08:46,166 --> 00:08:47,666
Hop-to, jackass!

130
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:49,041
But--why me?!

131
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,041
Vector X ready for launch!

132
00:09:06,833 --> 00:09:08,833
Vector Y. Booya!

133
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:12,583
Vector Z ready for launch!

134
00:09:20,625 --> 00:09:24,041
Okay, this isn't a simulation;
it's as real as it gets.

135
00:09:24,125 --> 00:09:25,916
All due respect, this is bunk.

136
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,958
You want me to fight bad guys
or you want me to baby-sit?

137
00:09:29,041 --> 00:09:31,708
Look, Cayenne, there's a
reason you're stuck with him.

138
00:09:31,791 --> 00:09:35,166
Apparently Amata draws
out Aquarion's power,

139
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:37,500
so bite the bullet and shut up.

140
00:09:37,583 --> 00:09:40,416
The "bad guys" get stronger
each time we push 'em back.

141
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,125
We can't afford to
give up an advantage

142
00:09:42,208 --> 00:09:43,666
if we intend to stay ahead.

143
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,708
That's the reality we face.

144
00:09:49,708 --> 00:09:51,791
I don't see the controller.

145
00:09:51,875 --> 00:09:54,958
They probably scrapped it.
Let's do this!

146
00:09:55,041 --> 00:09:57,750
Awright, Go! Aquarion!

147
00:10:13,916 --> 00:10:15,291
Aquarion Gepard!

148
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:31,291
Best of luck to
you guys. Be careful.

149
00:10:31,375 --> 00:10:33,166
I wonder if Amata's in there?

150
00:10:36,708 --> 00:10:39,916
I feel like--like
something's wrong.

151
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,375
What is that?

152
00:10:52,666 --> 00:10:54,041
We're boxed in!

153
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,166
They're so strong.

154
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:12,166
But I thought they
were unmanned, right?

155
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:14,416
The drones are
getting organized.

156
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:16,250
This is new.

157
00:11:16,333 --> 00:11:19,166
Somebody's got to be
pulling their strings.

158
00:11:24,541 --> 00:11:27,500
Showtime in five; ready to rock.

159
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:40,875
They're getting
torn apart out there!

160
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:42,291
Commander!

161
00:11:42,375 --> 00:11:44,583
Moment of truth: Shrade
needs to get off his ass now!

162
00:11:44,666 --> 00:11:45,750
Send him in!

163
00:11:45,833 --> 00:11:47,833
That is out of
the question, sir!

164
00:12:03,791 --> 00:12:05,291
Come on.

165
00:12:05,375 --> 00:12:08,041
The one calling the shots has
gotta be around here somewhere.

166
00:12:10,541 --> 00:12:14,000
I believe the appropriate
accent here is forte.

167
00:12:14,083 --> 00:12:15,541
If you please.

168
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:40,458
Shit! They got us now, guys!

169
00:12:40,833 --> 00:12:42,500
The controls aren't responding!

170
00:12:46,583 --> 00:12:47,666
What, the--

171
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:49,583
Where's the music coming from?

172
00:12:52,791 --> 00:12:54,875
Whatever you're
trying to do, Shrade--

173
00:12:58,625 --> 00:13:00,458
Wait.

174
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:17,083
Oh, it is on!

175
00:13:24,166 --> 00:13:27,458
Well damn.
Guess the jig is up, huh?

176
00:13:27,541 --> 00:13:30,375
To be fair, though,
you are still screwed.

177
00:13:33,708 --> 00:13:36,000
The controller was hiding
out on Three Fortunes?

178
00:13:36,083 --> 00:13:38,500
Damn it! Our boys
can't get a lock

179
00:13:38,583 --> 00:13:40,375
on the bastard from here!

180
00:13:46,916 --> 00:13:47,916
See? They're toast!

181
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,666
Turn us around! Now!

182
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:51,041
Oh, no...

183
00:13:51,125 --> 00:13:52,375
My apologies.

184
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:56,500
Everyone batten
down and grab hold!

185
00:13:57,666 --> 00:13:59,708
I, think he meant
the other direction!

186
00:14:00,083 --> 00:14:02,166
Destiny has only
one direction--

187
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:04,583
straight into the fray!

188
00:14:09,875 --> 00:14:10,916
For the record,
would it have killed ya

189
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,708
to not let me die
a freakin' virgin?!

190
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:16,041
Andy's aura is
going redline, sir!

191
00:14:16,125 --> 00:14:18,583
They won't be able to hold
formation for much longer!

192
00:14:18,666 --> 00:14:21,125
Chief Instruc---ugh--Commander!

193
00:14:21,208 --> 00:14:22,500
We have to change him out!

194
00:14:22,583 --> 00:14:23,625
Then send me in!

195
00:14:23,708 --> 00:14:24,833
Change them all out!

196
00:14:24,916 --> 00:14:26,875
C'mon, the chauvinists
have had their shot!

197
00:14:26,958 --> 00:14:27,833
Don't even go there!

198
00:14:27,916 --> 00:14:29,666
Sir, we need an order from you!

199
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:32,500
Seriously, Mix! This is
neither the time nor the place!

200
00:14:32,583 --> 00:14:33,458
I'm telling you, I've got this.

201
00:14:33,541 --> 00:14:35,208
Shut up!

202
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:37,583
Element Change!

203
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,041
That's right, you heard me.
Get Andy out of there now.

204
00:14:44,125 --> 00:14:46,375
Clear the way for Mikono.

205
00:14:48,333 --> 00:14:50,208
Who's this clown think he is?!

206
00:14:50,291 --> 00:14:52,541
What do you expect me to do?

207
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:53,875
I've got news for you, pal:

208
00:14:53,958 --> 00:14:56,291
this is the control room,
not a supply closet--

209
00:15:03,375 --> 00:15:06,125
Okay, why are you
dressed like that?

210
00:15:13,416 --> 00:15:16,791
Good heavens! Zen Fudo, sir!

211
00:15:16,875 --> 00:15:19,583
You know him?

212
00:15:19,666 --> 00:15:22,958
We've been awaiting your
arrival, High Commander, sir.

213
00:15:23,041 --> 00:15:25,333
Wait, did you just say...?

214
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:29,208
Mikono Suzushiro.
I want you in Andy's place.

215
00:15:29,291 --> 00:15:32,083
That's crazy!
I'm not qualified to fight!

216
00:15:32,166 --> 00:15:34,833
Aquarion would
just toss me out...

217
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,375
Observe.

218
00:15:42,458 --> 00:15:44,625
Three morons in a pinch.

219
00:15:44,708 --> 00:15:48,666
Three hammers to whom every
problem looks like a nail, yes?

220
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:50,291
Frightened. Each of
them in his way

221
00:15:50,375 --> 00:15:53,333
always clenching
for the next blow.

222
00:15:53,416 --> 00:15:54,750
Mikono! What are you doing?

223
00:15:54,833 --> 00:15:56,791
Get the hell out
of his friggin' lap!

224
00:15:56,875 --> 00:16:00,083
Mikono! Get up! We've gotta go!

225
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:04,583
Oh gosh, I think I get it.

226
00:16:04,916 --> 00:16:07,750
I'm-- I'm the nail, aren't I?

227
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:12,291
A little blood I can do without,
but you're a whole other story.

228
00:16:12,375 --> 00:16:18,375
Everything they've done,
everything was to protect me.

229
00:16:19,333 --> 00:16:20,458
Mikono!

230
00:16:20,541 --> 00:16:22,500
Mikono!!

231
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:27,666
Don't hate me, guys
I'm 'onna have to tag out.

232
00:16:31,125 --> 00:16:33,208
We have formation collapse!

233
00:16:36,458 --> 00:16:37,875
Send me up!

234
00:16:37,958 --> 00:16:41,375
Are you sure? You did say
you weren't qualified to fight.

235
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:44,250
Look, I'm not--

236
00:16:44,333 --> 00:16:49,375
I know I'm not really good
for much, but the thing is...

237
00:16:49,458 --> 00:16:53,166
I owe them. At the very least,
they shouldn't be alone!

238
00:16:53,916 --> 00:16:56,458
Well then, my dear! Godspeed.

239
00:17:02,166 --> 00:17:04,291
Execute the change!

240
00:17:13,416 --> 00:17:14,833
Mikono? What are you doing?!

241
00:17:14,916 --> 00:17:17,333
You're kidding me!
Who sent you up?!

242
00:17:17,416 --> 00:17:19,166
Don't; let's just
do this, alright?

243
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:19,875
But--

244
00:17:19,958 --> 00:17:20,958
There's no time!

245
00:17:21,041 --> 00:17:22,958
I forgive you,
but we need to merge!

246
00:17:23,041 --> 00:17:25,958
Wait, you do? Okay.

247
00:17:26,541 --> 00:17:28,416
Amata! That's your cue, lad!

248
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:34,125
Snow Melting Merge!
Go! Aquarion!

249
00:17:40,416 --> 00:17:43,125
Aquarion Evol!

250
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:54,708
Cute trick, but points off
for using a tac we know.

251
00:17:54,791 --> 00:17:56,875
You'll have to do
better than that.

252
00:18:03,291 --> 00:18:05,666
Mikono! Why did they
put you in a Vector?!

253
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:10,791
This is unacceptable! I don't
want you on the battlefield!

254
00:18:10,875 --> 00:18:12,166
Cayenne!

255
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:14,208
You don't get it, do you?

256
00:18:14,291 --> 00:18:18,041
The same horrible vision's
haunted me since we were kids.

257
00:18:18,125 --> 00:18:23,250
It's always you,
Mikono. Always Aquarion.

258
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,916
Always tragic.

259
00:18:28,708 --> 00:18:31,875
I've done everything to
keep it from becoming reality.

260
00:18:31,958 --> 00:18:35,541
And, if that means you
hate me, then so be it!

261
00:18:39,833 --> 00:18:41,625
I could never hate you.

262
00:18:41,708 --> 00:18:44,250
I know what a burden
your gift must be.

263
00:18:44,333 --> 00:18:46,541
You were looking out for me.

264
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:51,208
Thank you, but, things
need to change around here.

265
00:18:51,291 --> 00:18:55,958
It's a two-way street.
I wanna look out for you.

266
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:57,750
That's how it is,

267
00:18:57,833 --> 00:19:00,208
and if that means you're
mad at me, then so be it.

268
00:19:00,291 --> 00:19:01,666
Mikono...

269
00:19:05,458 --> 00:19:07,583
Same thing goes for you.

270
00:19:07,666 --> 00:19:10,375
We've gotta be
in this as a team.

271
00:19:10,458 --> 00:19:11,541
Are you with me?

272
00:19:11,625 --> 00:19:14,291
Yeah, sure.

273
00:19:14,375 --> 00:19:16,833
When you're with me, I...

274
00:19:16,916 --> 00:19:22,166
It's like, the sky's the limit.
I can do anything!

275
00:19:25,208 --> 00:19:27,583
Resonance between their
auras is looking good.

276
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:29,291
The form is secured.

277
00:19:29,625 --> 00:19:31,000
This is insanity!

278
00:19:48,916 --> 00:19:50,041
What the hell?

279
00:19:50,125 --> 00:19:52,750
It sounds like some kind
of heartbeat, or...?

280
00:19:56,083 --> 00:19:58,833
You feel the pulse of Aquarion.

281
00:19:58,916 --> 00:20:01,500
Its rhythm is the
drumbeat of youth.

282
00:20:03,875 --> 00:20:05,833
It's like I'm soaring
through the air,

283
00:20:05,916 --> 00:20:08,291
like the stars themselves
are reaching down for me...

284
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:13,208
My heart is racing, like
every blood vessel is on fire...

285
00:20:13,291 --> 00:20:14,833
aching to surge free...

286
00:20:14,916 --> 00:20:18,875
With our hands held fast,
there is nothing we can't do!

287
00:20:19,416 --> 00:20:21,208
Infinity is ours!

288
00:20:33,708 --> 00:20:35,541
Good gracious, its arm!

289
00:20:47,083 --> 00:20:48,416
Aw crap.

290
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,625
The Infinity Punch.

291
00:21:05,708 --> 00:21:08,750
Another legend given
a new lease on life.

292
00:21:21,125 --> 00:21:24,208
Another seal broken
by Fudo's meddling hand.

293
00:21:24,291 --> 00:21:25,750
Well done, sir.

294
00:21:29,666 --> 00:21:31,583
Alrighty. Didn't really
see that one coming.

295
00:21:31,666 --> 00:21:35,500
Kudos to you. One to grow on.

296
00:21:35,583 --> 00:21:39,208
Izumo and I are much obliged
for the eye-opening encounter.

297
00:21:39,291 --> 00:21:43,875
Okay, fine. I'll ask the obvious
question: when does it stop?

298
00:21:43,958 --> 00:21:46,375
Heads up guys! The fist is
heading straight for HQ!

299
00:21:46,458 --> 00:21:47,916
What?!

300
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,458
The-- The Berlin is--!

301
00:22:10,666 --> 00:22:12,541
Restrain yourselves!

302
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:16,500
The wall 'twixt you
may lie in ruins,

303
00:22:16,583 --> 00:22:19,708
but fulsome cadets, take heed!

304
00:22:23,125 --> 00:22:26,083
Tragically,
love must yet be sin!

305
00:22:26,166 --> 00:22:27,750
What?!

306
00:22:47,625 --> 00:22:51,583
A beautiful morning for it,
though; you must admit.

307
00:24:23,416 --> 00:24:25,875
Love blossoms poolside.

308
00:24:25,958 --> 00:24:29,125
Cocktail in hand,
your cheeks blush.

309
00:24:29,208 --> 00:24:32,041
Romance ere the Fall.

310
00:24:32,125 --> 00:24:36,166
Next time on Aquarion Evol:
"Romance Prohibition Order."
