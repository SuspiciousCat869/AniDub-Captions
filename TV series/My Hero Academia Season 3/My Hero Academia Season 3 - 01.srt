Welcome to UA High.

In a world where about 80
percent of the population

has some kind of superpower
called a "Quirk,"

My name is Izuku Midoriya,

I've figured it out.

00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:35,833
Why the Hero Killer
pisses me off so much.

23

And why those UA brats
drive me crazy.

It's because of All Might.

Quirkless until middle school,

32
00:03:01,083 --> 00:03:03,666
when he suddenly
manifested a power.

33
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:05,541
After enrolling at UA High,

34
00:03:05,625 --> 00:03:08,291
he distinguished himself by
finishing in the top eight

35

Let's start with Yuga Aoyama.

83
00:05:12,291 --> 00:05:14,000
His Quirk is Navel Laser.

84
00:05:14,083 --> 00:05:16,958
It's... basically,
a bellybutton laser.

85
00:05:17,041 --> 00:05:20,000
Then we have
Mina Ashido. Quirk: Acid.

86
00:05:20,083 --> 00:05:23,250
She secretes a corrosive
substance that melts targets.

87
00:05:23,333 --> 00:05:26,208
Tsuyu Asui. Her Quirk is Frog.

88
00:05:26,291 --> 00:05:29,416
And she can do pretty much
everything a frog can.

89
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:33,083
Tenya Iida is the
class rep. Quirk: Engine.

90
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:36,375
The engines in his calves
grant him super speed.

There's Ochaco Uraraka.
Her Quirk: Zero Gravity.

92
00:05:40,291 --> 00:05:42,666
She can make anything
she touches weightless.

93
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:45,916
Mashirao Ojiro. His Quirk
is called "Tail."

94
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,041
He can manipulate his tail
as if it were an arm or leg.

He discharges built-up
electricity from his body.

is Eijiro Kirishima.

He can make his
entire body stone-like.

Koji Koda is the quiet type.
Though, his Quirk is Anivoice.

101
00:06:06,291 --> 00:06:08,166
He uses it to control
animals and insects,

but it can't affect humans.

He turns the sugar stored
in his body into pure power.

Her Quirk is called
"Earphone Jack."

Using the retractable
plugs on her earlobes,

111
00:06:29,625 --> 00:06:32,125
she can distinguish between
even the quietest of sounds.

112
00:06:32,208 --> 00:06:33,875
Plus, she can use the
speakers on her legs

113

to release incredibly
devastating sonic bursts.

It has many uses.

He can shoot sticky
tape from his elbows

117
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:44,291
and use it to apprehend
his opponents,

00:06:44,375 --> 00:06:47,375
or simply to swing
around through the air.

Fumikage Tokoyami.
Quirk: Dark Shadow.

that gets wilder when
there's no light.

His Quirk is
Half-Cold, Half-Hot.

He can emit ice from the
right side of his body,

and flames from the left.

He sweats a
nitroglycerin-like substance

131
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,750
and makes it blow up.

head can stick to anything,

though he himself
bounces off them.

Her Quirk is Creation.

141

00:08:14,458 --> 00:08:16,416
Plus, if we're at school,
we can use our Quirks!

161
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:19,458
It'll be the perfect
way to train!

162
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:21,541
Just what you'd
expect from us heroes.

163
00:08:21,625 --> 00:08:23,250
You know what we're gonna do.

164
00:08:23,333 --> 00:08:25,291
Go beyond. Plus Ultra!

165
00:08:25,375 --> 00:08:26,875
Ultra!

166
00:08:26,958 --> 00:08:29,083
[KAMINARI] It was a smart
choice to invite Midoriya.

167
00:08:29,166 --> 00:08:30,583
He's a great cover.

168
00:08:30,666 --> 00:08:32,166
[MINETA] If it had just
been us, we wouldn't have

169
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:34,250
gotten permission to
use the pool, I bet.

170
00:08:34,333 --> 00:08:35,333
[KAMINARI]
This works, and it could be

171
00:08:35,416 --> 00:08:37,333
the defining moment
of our lives.

172
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:38,666
[MINETA]
Don't jinx us.

173
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:40,875
I told you what I
heard the girls say.

174
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:43,083
It was right after
the finals were over.

175
00:08:43,166 --> 00:08:44,708
Wait, so we're not
supposed to take any

176
00:08:44,791 --> 00:08:46,458
long trips over summer vacation?

177
00:08:46,541 --> 00:08:48,958
Yeah, apparently that's
what the school said.

178
00:08:49,041 --> 00:08:50,500
How unfortunate.

179
00:08:50,583 --> 00:08:52,083
I was supposed to
spend several weeks

180
00:08:52,166 --> 00:08:53,750
touring Venice with my parents.

181
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:55,208
What is your life?

182
00:08:55,291 --> 00:08:58,833
Aw, and I just bought, like,
a bajillion new swimsuits.

183
00:08:58,916 --> 00:09:00,916
Well turns out,
that's what happens

184
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,083
when your class is attacked
by the League of Villains.

185
00:09:03,166 --> 00:09:04,416
But I wanna <i>do</i> something!

186
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:05,916
I don't wanna spend
my whole summer bored!

187
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,083
--That's so dumb!
--[HAGAKURE] I've got it!

188
00:09:07,166 --> 00:09:08,541
Why don't we hang out
at the school pool

189
00:09:08,625 --> 00:09:10,458
over summer vacation, huh?

190
00:09:10,541 --> 00:09:11,708
Good idea.

191
00:09:11,791 --> 00:09:13,583
I bet we can talk the
teachers into letting us

192
00:09:13,666 --> 00:09:15,500
use it if we ask them nicely.

193
00:09:15,583 --> 00:09:18,000
Plus it'll be free,
so we'll save money.

194
00:09:18,083 --> 00:09:20,291
That's way better than
being cooped up in my room.

195
00:09:20,375 --> 00:09:21,666
Leave it to me.

196
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:24,958
I'll start working on a
formal proposal right away.

197
00:09:25,041 --> 00:09:26,583
All the girls in
their swimsuits!

198
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:29,166
[KAMINARI] It's our duty
to support our classmates.

199
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:31,083
[MINETA] Just imagine how
voluptuous the girls

200
00:09:31,166 --> 00:09:33,416
are gonna be outside
of their uniforms.

201
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:34,833
[MINETA, KAMINARI]
Faster, hurry up!

202
00:09:34,916 --> 00:09:39,750
Paradise is waiting on the
other side of this door!

203
00:09:39,833 --> 00:09:41,000
There you are, slowpokes.

204
00:09:41,083 --> 00:09:42,250
[KAMINARI, MINETA yelp]

205
00:09:42,333 --> 00:09:43,375
[MINETA]
No, no, no.

206
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:45,708
What the heck are
you guys doing here?

207
00:09:45,791 --> 00:09:47,916
Since we're doing endurance
training at the pool,

208
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,250
I messaged everyone to see if
they wanted to come with us.

209
00:09:50,333 --> 00:09:51,375
You did what?

210
00:09:51,458 --> 00:09:53,125
Now all our plans are ruined.

211
00:09:53,208 --> 00:09:54,500
Don't lose hope yet.

212
00:09:54,583 --> 00:09:56,041
There will definitely
still be girls

213
00:09:56,125 --> 00:09:58,375
splashing around the water.

214
00:09:58,458 --> 00:10:00,875
[KAMINARI] I'll burn
the sight into my brain.

215
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:03,125
[MINETA] I can't wait
to see those skimpy suits!

216
00:10:03,208 --> 00:10:04,750
Oh, hey. Hi, Mineta.

217
00:10:04,833 --> 00:10:06,208
I didn't know you guys
would be here.

218
00:10:06,291 --> 00:10:08,791
[KAMINARI] I can't believe
there's not a single bikini.

219
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:10,041
Foiled again.

220
00:10:10,125 --> 00:10:12,250
You know, school suits
are still pretty hot.

221
00:10:12,333 --> 00:10:13,875
[KAMINARI]
Have some standards, dude.

222
00:10:13,958 --> 00:10:15,916
[TENYA]
Kaminari. Mineta. Nice work.

223
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,833
I'm proud of you for
suggesting more training.

224
00:10:17,916 --> 00:10:21,166
You're an asset to our class.
Let me thank you.

225

[BOTH whimper]

226
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:23,875
[TENYA]
Now. Don't just sit there.

227
00:10:23,958 --> 00:10:26,041
It's time to come sweat with us.

228

[KAMINARI, MINETA]
This wasn't the plan!

231
00:10:40,666 --> 00:10:44,125

Get ready for it! Serve!

00:10:50,875 --> 00:10:52,541
[YAOYOROZU]
Set!

237
00:10:52,625 --> 00:10:55,041
[TENYA] All right! Let's
take a 15-minute breather.

238
00:10:55,125 --> 00:10:58,708
I brought these for everyone.
Please, drink up!

239
00:10:58,791 --> 00:10:59,666
[SATO]
Nice!

240
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:00,875
[OJIRO]
Thanks a lot, Class Rep.

241
00:11:00,958 --> 00:11:03,166
[SERO]
This is just what I needed!

242
00:11:05,708 --> 00:11:07,958
[KAMINARI] Why do the girls
get to play around instead?

243
00:11:08,041 --> 00:11:09,416
[MINETA] They got permission
to use the pool,

244
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,916
so they can goof off.
Can you believe it?

245
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,333
You idiot.

246
00:11:13,416 --> 00:11:15,666
Why did you make our application
for endurance training.

247
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:16,833
Sure, blame me,

248
00:11:16,916 --> 00:11:19,083
I didn't hear you
making any suggestions!

249
00:11:19,166 --> 00:11:20,708
It looks like you've
been working out.

250
00:11:20,791 --> 00:11:22,375
I'm practically
living at the gym.

251
00:11:22,458 --> 00:11:24,208
It's been kinda nice, actually.

252
00:11:24,291 --> 00:11:26,208
[TOKOYAMI]
We must all remain focused.

[TENYA]
Hey, Midoriya.

255
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:32,083
It looks like you
could use a break.

256
00:11:32,166 --> 00:11:34,333
You're probably right, thanks.

257
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:39,625
[IZUKU]
Something wrong?

258
00:11:39,708 --> 00:11:43,625
No. This is just
funny, that's all.

259
00:11:43,708 --> 00:11:45,250
At the entrance exams,

260
00:11:45,333 --> 00:11:47,375
I couldn't imagine the
two of us would get along,

261
00:11:47,458 --> 00:11:49,750
much less become
such good friends.

262
00:11:49,833 --> 00:11:51,416
I guess, if I'm being honest,

263
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:54,083
I didn't think that
much of you back then.

You did put Uraraka
ahead of yourself.

00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:17,208
Even though saving her
meant you might not pass.

[ALL MIGHT] How could a
hero course reject someone

who is committed
to saving others,

272
00:12:20,916 --> 00:12:23,833
no matter the
consequences to himself?

273
00:12:23,916 --> 00:12:26,958
After all, that is
what makes a hero.

Even though I knew
it was a long shot.

281
00:12:43,875 --> 00:12:46,500
And then, when Mr. Aizawa
said the person

282
00:12:46,583 --> 00:12:49,125
in last place for the fitness
test would be expelled,

I was sure I'd be going home.

00:20:41,166 --> 00:20:43,166
[ALL MIGHT]
Young Midoriya?

476
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:46,583
[IZUKU] All Might!
What are you doing here?

477
00:20:46,666 --> 00:20:48,833
[ALL MIGHT]
I could ask you the same.

478
00:20:48,916 --> 00:20:50,791
[IZUKU]
I am here...

479
00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:54,583
[ALL MIGHT] Young man.
You, too, can become a hero.

480
00:20:54,666 --> 00:20:55,833
The truth is,

481
00:20:55,916 --> 00:20:58,416
there's nothing natural
about my Quirk.

482
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,000
I wasn't born with this power,

483
00:21:00,083 --> 00:21:02,125
it's a sacred torch
that was passed on to me

484
00:21:02,208 --> 00:21:03,583
from someone else.

485
00:21:03,666 --> 00:21:05,833
I can transfer
my Quirk to another.

486
00:21:05,916 --> 00:21:09,083
And that's only one facet
of my secret abilities.

487
00:21:09,166 --> 00:21:14,166
The true name of my
power is One For All.

488
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:15,416
You're next, kid.

489
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:18,416
You are my worthy successor.

490
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:22,375
...because this is where
my journey began.

491
00:21:25,166 --> 00:21:26,625
[ALL MIGHT]
Young Midoriya,

492
00:21:26,708 --> 00:21:28,916
the summer training
camp will be tough.

493
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,333
Try your hardest.

494
00:21:30,416 --> 00:21:31,500
[IZUKU]
I will!

495
00:23:01,791 --> 00:23:04,583
[VLAD] So the location of
the training camp has moved?

496
00:23:04,666 --> 00:23:06,125
[AIZAWA]
Yes.

497
00:23:06,208 --> 00:23:08,833
Just in case information is
getting leaked to the villains.

498
00:23:08,916 --> 00:23:12,083
Only the upper management of UA
knows where it will be now.

499
00:23:12,166 --> 00:23:15,750
Please keep it to yourself.
Don't even tell the students.

500
00:23:15,833 --> 00:23:17,083
[VLAD grunts]

501
00:23:17,166 --> 00:23:20,000
[phone ringing]

502
00:23:20,083 --> 00:23:21,333
[SHIGARAKI]
There's something I'd like you

503
00:23:21,416 --> 00:23:24,333
to prepare for me. That's right.

504
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:27,875
We're about to start
playing a brand new game.

505
00:23:29,041 --> 00:23:30,375
[IZUKU]
Now, the preview!

506
00:23:30,458 --> 00:23:32,708
UA High's special summer
training camp in the woods

507
00:23:32,791 --> 00:23:34,375
is about to be under way!

508
00:23:34,458 --> 00:23:37,208
From what I hear, it'll include
a hellish workout regimen

509
00:23:37,291 --> 00:23:38,916
to give us first years
the push we need

510
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,166
to earn our provisional
hero licenses.

511
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:42,958
Students normally don't
even try for those

512
00:23:43,041 --> 00:23:44,583
until thier second year!

513
00:23:44,666 --> 00:23:47,791
[yelps] Wait! Is that
some kind of monster?!

514
00:23:47,875 --> 00:23:48,666
Next time:

515
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:50,791
"Wild, Wild Pussycats."

516
00:23:50,875 --> 00:23:52,333
If I'm gonna become a hero,

517
00:23:52,416 --> 00:23:54,875
then first, I'll have
to survive this summer!

518
00:23:54,958 --> 00:23:58,000
Go beyond! Plus Ultra!
