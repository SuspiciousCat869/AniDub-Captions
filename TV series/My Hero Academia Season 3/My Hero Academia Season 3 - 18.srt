00:00:10,375 --> 00:00:13,000
[IZUKU] Welcome to UA High,
the prestigious school

2
00:00:13,083 --> 00:00:16,125
that's turned out some of
the world's greatest heroes.

3
00:00:16,208 --> 00:00:18,250
I'm running toward my
dream in these halls.

4
00:00:18,333 --> 00:00:20,416
Learning to overcome
obstacles and save people

5
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:22,833
with a smile on my face.

6
00:00:22,916 --> 00:00:25,916
That's how I'll become the
greatest hero in the world!

7
00:01:59,416 --> 00:02:01,875
The first 100 students
to fulfill the requirements

8
00:02:01,958 --> 00:02:03,916
will pass today.

9
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,291
The examinee will put
three of these targets

10
00:02:06,375 --> 00:02:09,458
on his or her body.
They can go anywhere you want

11
00:02:09,541 --> 00:02:11,750
as long as it's an exposed area.

12
00:02:11,833 --> 00:02:15,125
So no soles of the
feet or armpits.

13
00:02:15,208 --> 00:02:18,875
Each of you will also
have six of these balls.

14
00:02:18,958 --> 00:02:20,916
The targets are
programmed to light up

15
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,500
whenever they've been
touched by the balls.

16
00:02:23,583 --> 00:02:27,083
If all three targets
light up, you're out.

17
00:02:27,166 --> 00:02:29,708
Oh, and the person who
lights up your third target

18
00:02:29,791 --> 00:02:32,166
will get credit for your defeat.

19
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:36,125
You get through this round
by taking down two people.

20
00:02:36,208 --> 00:02:38,375
I'm sure each of you
have different terrains

21
00:02:38,458 --> 00:02:40,541
that you like or want to avoid.

22
00:02:40,625 --> 00:02:43,208
Use your Quirks well
and do your best.

23
00:02:43,291 --> 00:02:45,375
Or not. Whatever.

24
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:47,833
[MERA]
Let's see.

25
00:02:47,916 --> 00:02:50,791
The 62nd person has
passed the exam.

26
00:02:50,875 --> 00:02:54,833
[sighs] Another 38,
and it'll finally be over.

27
00:02:54,916 --> 00:02:57,416
All right, guys. Let's
think about our situation.

28
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:00,250
At the beginning of the test,
we focused on attacking UA,

29
00:03:00,333 --> 00:03:03,833
splitting them up and putting
them in check right off the bat.

30
00:03:03,916 --> 00:03:06,083
Now our school's going
after them in two groups.

31
00:03:06,166 --> 00:03:08,916
But a bunch of other classes
took advantage of our work.

32
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,083
And we're at the final
stage of the test.

33
00:03:11,166 --> 00:03:12,791
So everyone's fighting
at max levels,

34
00:03:12,875 --> 00:03:16,416
and the arena's full
of chaos. It's a warzone!

35
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,000
Your attack kinda backfired.

36
00:03:18,083 --> 00:03:19,750
We didn't take out
any of those kids.

37
00:03:19,833 --> 00:03:21,250
I mean, I know I was rushing,

38
00:03:21,333 --> 00:03:22,750
but if you really
think about it,

39
00:03:22,833 --> 00:03:25,041
this is a pretty good
place to be in.

40
00:03:25,125 --> 00:03:27,166
As long as we don't freak out,
we can take advantage

41
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:28,666
of the current state of the exam

42
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:31,625
and the desperate
players involved.

43
00:03:31,708 --> 00:03:33,375
Right now, all anyone
can think about

44
00:03:33,458 --> 00:03:35,541
is the number of slots left,
so they're panicking

45
00:03:35,625 --> 00:03:38,416
and no doubt being careless.
Burning through stamina.

46
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:39,583
They've got tunnel vision,

47
00:03:39,666 --> 00:03:41,458
and are focusing on UA,
since they have

48
00:03:41,541 --> 00:03:44,125
the most intel on them, which
means that we can lie in wait

49
00:03:44,208 --> 00:03:46,291
until the perfect
moment to strike.

50
00:03:46,375 --> 00:03:48,666
We've basically already
passed the test.

51
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:51,083
It's about time you stopped
pretending to be so nice.

52
00:03:51,166 --> 00:03:53,416
Honestly. You're too sneaky, yo.

53
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,333
[SHINDO] I'd prefer
to be called "tactful."

54
00:03:55,416 --> 00:03:57,708
Besides, if we swoop in
at the eleventh hour

55
00:03:57,791 --> 00:03:59,791
and make it a good
show, it'll prove

56
00:03:59,875 --> 00:04:01,875
we have an indomitable spirit.

57
00:04:01,958 --> 00:04:03,958
Everyone taking this
exam is struggling

58
00:04:04,041 --> 00:04:06,250
to live up to their own ideals.

59
00:04:08,208 --> 00:04:09,333
I respect that.

60
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:12,291
But unfortunately,
I can't go easy on 'em.

61
00:04:17,583 --> 00:04:21,416
[SHISHIKURA] UA High.
I have respect for your school.

62
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:23,708
I take pride in the fact
that our institutions

63
00:04:23,791 --> 00:04:26,083
are treated as equals.

64
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:27,833
But your class is shameful.

65
00:04:27,916 --> 00:04:29,875
You act in ways
that disgrace heroes.

66
00:04:29,958 --> 00:04:31,041
He's attacking again!

67
00:04:31,125 --> 00:04:32,208
I don't wanna be gross!

68
00:04:32,291 --> 00:04:33,166
Shut up!

69
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:36,291
"Obligation"? "Dignity"?

70
00:04:36,375 --> 00:04:38,625
You just like to
hear yourself talk.

71
00:04:38,708 --> 00:04:40,250
I don't see any proof.

72
00:04:40,333 --> 00:04:43,125
Show us with your actions,
not your cheap words.

73
00:04:43,208 --> 00:04:44,541
If you can.

74
00:04:44,625 --> 00:04:48,000

of all, Bakugo!

[SHISHIKURA grunts]

77
00:04:54,208 --> 00:04:56,458
I had to make a weak version
so I didn't kill anyone.

78
00:04:56,541 --> 00:04:57,875
You know what,
this is why everyone's

79
00:04:57,958 --> 00:05:00,291
terrified of you--
you're way too hardcore!

80
00:05:00,375 --> 00:05:01,500
Dammit.

81
00:05:01,583 --> 00:05:02,875
[SHISHIKURA]
I can't believe I fell for that.

82
00:05:02,958 --> 00:05:04,250
But I won't again.

83
00:05:04,333 --> 00:05:07,291
So those nasty finger things
just float back to 'im?

84
00:05:07,375 --> 00:05:09,333
[SHISHIKURA] He's the type
who reacts impulsively

85
00:05:09,416 --> 00:05:10,875
to a simple provocation.

86
00:05:10,958 --> 00:05:12,458
This sort of
mentality comes from

87
00:05:12,541 --> 00:05:14,875
an inflated sense of pride.

88
00:05:14,958 --> 00:05:16,166
I see now.

89
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:18,375
I'll teach you a lesson
by breaking you.

90
00:05:18,458 --> 00:05:20,500
This will show you what
it means to be dignified

91
00:05:20,583 --> 00:05:22,333
and behave like a hero!

92
00:05:22,416 --> 00:05:24,083
What is up with
this disgusting dude?

93
00:05:24,166 --> 00:05:25,833
He thinks he's better than us.

94
00:05:25,916 --> 00:05:27,083
But I bet he'll
shut up when I...

[KAMINARI]
Hey, wait, don't forget

96
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:29,541
that we're in the
middle of a test!

97
00:05:29,625 --> 00:05:31,708
That's exactly why
I'll kill the guy!

98
00:05:31,791 --> 00:05:32,833
Absurd!

99

Ugh. Let's just get
this fight over with.

100
00:05:41,041 --> 00:05:43,500
Maybe this'll speed
things along.

101
00:05:43,583 --> 00:05:45,041
You should work on your aim.

102

Ah-- Aw, crap!

103
00:05:46,375 --> 00:05:47,583
And your look.

104

Maybe I can make you
something more appealing.

105

[KATSUKI]
Enough talk. Die!

106
00:05:55,333 --> 00:05:57,541
You've left yourself open.

What the--?

108

[SHISHIKURA]
You weren't paying attention.

109
00:06:01,791 --> 00:06:05,166
I had a piece of flesh
sneak beneath us.

110
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:07,916
You saw. Earlier with Kirishima.

111

[PRESENT MIC] Shiketsu
High School. Second year.

Seiji Shishikura.

His Quirk: Meatball!

118
00:06:28,291 --> 00:06:30,875
He can reshape flesh
by massaging it.

119
00:06:30,958 --> 00:06:32,125
For someone else's body,

120
00:06:32,208 --> 00:06:34,333
he can only knead it
and make it a ball.

121
00:06:34,416 --> 00:06:36,375
But, his own flesh
is more versatile!

122
00:06:36,458 --> 00:06:38,291
For example, he can cut it off,

123
00:06:38,375 --> 00:06:41,000
manipulate it, or make
controllable objects.

124
00:06:41,083 --> 00:06:43,083
It's as handy
as it is horrifying!

125
00:06:43,166 --> 00:06:44,916
No way!

126
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,083
[SHISHIKURA]
This is a demonstration.

127
00:06:47,166 --> 00:06:49,916
The test has an unusually
low passing rate.

128
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,791
At first this
seemed counterintuitive

129
00:06:51,875 --> 00:06:54,375
given our current world.
With All Might retired,

130
00:06:54,458 --> 00:06:55,500
wouldn't it make more sense

131
00:06:55,583 --> 00:06:57,625
to flood the streets
with heroes?

132
00:06:57,708 --> 00:06:59,166
And so,

133
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:01,416
I must assume that their goal
is to weed out the riffraff.

134
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,875
We can surmise that they're
starting to be more selective

135
00:07:03,958 --> 00:07:07,333
in order to bring the profession
of hero to a higher level.

136
00:07:07,416 --> 00:07:09,375
And I agree with
this way of thinking.

137
00:07:09,458 --> 00:07:11,958
So I decided to thin
the herd myself.

138
00:07:12,041 --> 00:07:13,125
You're ignoring the test

139
00:07:13,208 --> 00:07:14,916
because you think
you're superior?

140
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,875
What are you, a crazy person?

141
00:07:16,958 --> 00:07:18,875
[SHISHIKURA] I'm simply
separating the mediocre

142
00:07:18,958 --> 00:07:21,416
and extraordinary. By the way,

will torture

but hurling insults
at us this entire time.

I'm kinda starting to take
it personally, ya know.

149
00:07:36,166 --> 00:07:38,750
Then perhaps you are more
self-aware than I thought.

150
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:42,041
I'd take time to reflect
on your failure.

fashion statement.

That's it! He tossed it to you.

[KAMINARI]
By the way, big shot.

161
00:08:07,166 --> 00:08:10,708
You've stumbled into
a really killer spot.

162
00:08:10,791 --> 00:08:14,500

[POWER LOADER]
Sharpshooting?

164
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:20,041
[KAMINARI] I can't really
manipulate electricity,

165
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:22,833
so it gets hard to fight
with other people around.

166
00:08:22,916 --> 00:08:25,625
Do you think you could
help me with that?

167
00:08:25,708 --> 00:08:26,666
[POWER LOADER]
I've got a solution

168
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:28,000
to your problem, I think.

169
00:08:28,083 --> 00:08:30,125
We're calling it a
pointer and shooter.

170
00:08:30,208 --> 00:08:33,166
It's a genius baby the two
of us collaborated on!

171
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:35,083
Fire with the pointer
set to "Shooter,"

172
00:08:35,166 --> 00:08:38,291
and the projectile
will stick on impact.

173
00:08:38,375 --> 00:08:40,375
As long as you're within
ten meters of the spot

174
00:08:40,458 --> 00:08:42,500
you've tagged, your
electricity will be gathered

175
00:08:42,583 --> 00:08:43,916
in a single line.

176
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,250
If you have multiple targets,

177
00:08:45,333 --> 00:08:47,291
then you can use the
dial to select them.

178
00:08:47,375 --> 00:08:48,833
The attached scope
will help you lock on

179
00:08:48,916 --> 00:08:50,291
to their exact locations.

180
00:08:50,375 --> 00:08:54,000
Uh... You mean it requires
a lot of thinking?

181
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,791
But if I fight with this,
then I won't run the risk

182
00:08:58,875 --> 00:09:01,083
of zapping my teammates, will I?

183
00:09:04,791 --> 00:09:07,333
[KAMINARI]
I understand, Bakugo.

184
00:09:07,416 --> 00:09:09,041
You stopped our
opponent's attacks using

185
00:09:09,125 --> 00:09:12,500
your smaller-ranged new move
instead of a big explosion.

186
00:09:12,583 --> 00:09:13,875
Not because you were
testing it out,

187
00:09:13,958 --> 00:09:16,416
but so you wouldn't
hit me or Kirishima.

188
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:18,916
You actually had
us on your mind.

Listen up.

190
00:09:20,375 --> 00:09:23,333
Bakugo might seem like
a total jerk on the surface,

191
00:09:23,416 --> 00:09:26,750
but he's actually trying
really hard to be a pro hero.

192
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:29,125
He threw that grenade
to me while being attacked.

193
00:09:29,208 --> 00:09:32,125
That was the result of
calm judgment and planning.

194
00:09:32,208 --> 00:09:33,666
And Kirishima is
such a good dude

195
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:36,375
that he rushed into enemy
territory for his friends,

196
00:09:36,458 --> 00:09:39,625
even though it was a
totally stupid thing to do.

my hold on them for a second.

The more damage he takes,

204
00:09:59,375 --> 00:10:01,333
the more people get released.

205
00:10:01,416 --> 00:10:02,875
[KATSUKI]
No wonder he was only using

Guess I shouldn't be surprised
with that Quirk you got.

Wait. Hold on. What did he say?

316
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:33,791
It looks like you've made
that borrowed power your own.

317
00:14:33,875 --> 00:14:35,083
[gasps]

318
00:14:36,541 --> 00:14:37,791
[IZUKU]
You'll see.

319
00:14:37,875 --> 00:14:39,583
I'll work until
I have full control

320
00:14:39,666 --> 00:14:41,666
of this borrowed Quirk.

321
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:44,500
And I'll finally beat you
with my own power!

322
00:14:48,041 --> 00:14:49,666
Kacchan...

323
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:54,958
Oh, hey! What a relief.

324

I was starting
to get so worried!

325
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:58,583
No need to worry
about us, Yao-momo.

326
00:14:58,666 --> 00:15:00,500
What's up? When did
you guys pass?

327
00:15:00,583 --> 00:15:01,833
You been here long?

328
00:15:01,916 --> 00:15:04,958
[SHOJI] We just finished
as well. Todoroki beat us.

329
00:15:05,041 --> 00:15:07,500
[JIRO] I was kinda shocked
Bakugo wasn't here already.

330
00:15:07,583 --> 00:15:09,833
But I get it now. It's
because you were with him.

331
00:15:09,916 --> 00:15:10,833
Oh, come on!

332
00:15:10,916 --> 00:15:12,333
Why is everyone
dragging me today?

333
00:15:12,416 --> 00:15:13,583
Ochaco?

334
00:15:13,666 --> 00:15:15,666
The key to take off your
targets is in the back.

335
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:17,250
They asked us to return
them to the shelf

336
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:18,583
now that we're done.

337

Oh, cool. Thank you, Tsu.

338
00:15:20,125 --> 00:15:21,291
I'll do that.

339

Looks like only 11 from
our class have passed.

340
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:25,666
So nine more to go.

341
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:29,500
And the announcement said
only 18 spots left.

342
00:15:29,583 --> 00:15:31,208
[IZUKU]
Come on, guys.

343
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:37,541
That target's mine!

There are two of us, Iida.

00:15:42,583 --> 00:15:44,041
This has turned into a war.

348

Iit's going to be très hard
for both of us to survive it!

[TENYA]
What are you talking about?

351
00:15:49,083 --> 00:15:51,666
Keep fighting! Class 1-A
does not give up.

352
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:53,791
Non, that's not what I'm doing.

353
00:15:57,041 --> 00:15:59,333
[TENYA]
We're finished if we stay put.

354
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:01,625
Ah, balls, almost out of time!

355
00:16:01,708 --> 00:16:04,416
So how are we gonna
get our points?

356
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:07,500
[MERA] Wow. Eight people just
passed at the same time.

357
00:16:07,583 --> 00:16:09,333
That leaves only ten open spots.

358
00:16:09,416 --> 00:16:12,666
Ha! Those eight were
all from my class!

359
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:15,541
See 'em? They're headed
into the anteroom.

Great job there, kiddos!

361

[AIZAWA]
Ten people left.

362
00:16:19,791 --> 00:16:21,208
Looks like our class...

363
00:16:21,291 --> 00:16:23,750
...still has nine people
who haven't passed.

364
00:16:23,833 --> 00:16:26,500
I hate to say it, but it's
not sounding good for us.

365
00:16:30,333 --> 00:16:31,416
[TENYA]
I want to serve our peers

366

to the best of my abilities.

That's what my brother would do.

368
00:16:35,875 --> 00:16:39,208
It's through my actions that
I'll realize my ultimate dream.

[AOYAMA]
Your ultimate dream...

Papa! Maman!

371
00:16:46,041 --> 00:16:48,708
Why am I so different
from everybody else?

[TENYA gasps]

373
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,458
Um. What is that?

374
00:17:06,541 --> 00:17:08,166
[TENYA]
Are you out of your mind?

375
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:11,208
Seriously. What are you doing?

376
00:17:11,291 --> 00:17:12,375
I'm standing out.

377
00:17:12,458 --> 00:17:13,833
[TENYA]
Yes. Yes, you are.

378
00:17:13,916 --> 00:17:15,250
That's exactly the problem.

379
00:17:15,333 --> 00:17:17,625
If you try to protect me,
you'll fail the test.

380
00:17:17,708 --> 00:17:19,500
I've already got two
of my triggers hit,

381
00:17:19,583 --> 00:17:21,125
and they'll be swarming me soon.

382

You'll have a much better
chance without me.

spotlight, you can sneak up

on the people who come after me.

387
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:34,125
With your speed, you should
be able to hit their targets.

[TENYA]
Where is this even coming from?

earlier inspired me.

at our school.

[YOARASHI] Huh?! What do
you mean Shishikura

470
00:22:36,208 --> 00:22:37,250
didn't pass the test?

471
00:22:37,333 --> 00:22:38,583
[MORA]
Tone it down.

472
00:22:38,666 --> 00:22:40,416
It's because he went ahead
of us and fought alone,

473
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:43,458
like he didn't need help.
Just like you two.

474
00:22:43,541 --> 00:22:46,583
Yoarashi at least has the
excuse that he's a first year.

475
00:22:46,666 --> 00:22:48,000
But not you, Camie!

476
00:22:48,083 --> 00:22:49,583
Yeah, yeah.

477
00:22:49,666 --> 00:22:50,833
[MERA]
Oh, right.

478
00:22:50,916 --> 00:22:52,833
For the 100 of you who
passed the first test,

479
00:22:52,916 --> 00:22:56,083
please turn your
attention to the screen.

480
00:22:56,166 --> 00:22:57,458
Huh. It's the test arena.

481
00:22:57,541 --> 00:22:59,291
What's gonna happen next?

482
00:23:09,125 --> 00:23:11,041
[STUDENTS]
Why?

483
00:23:11,125 --> 00:23:13,541
Wait. Does that mean...?

484
00:23:13,625 --> 00:23:16,291
[MERA] There's only one
more round to the exam.

485
00:23:16,375 --> 00:23:18,875
Your goal is simple:
undertake rescue exercises

486
00:23:18,958 --> 00:23:20,666
and save the bystanders
who are trapped

487
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:23,041
in these disaster sites.

488
00:23:24,833 --> 00:23:26,333
A rescue mission.

489
00:23:29,291 --> 00:23:30,791
[IZUKU]
Here's the preview!

490
00:23:30,875 --> 00:23:34,041
The final test is to save people
who're trapped around the arena.

491
00:23:34,125 --> 00:23:36,166
The hero license and this exam.

492
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:38,500
They're both steps
toward my dream!

493
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:40,833
Next time: "Rescue Exercises"!

494
00:23:40,916 --> 00:23:43,500
Go beyond! Plus Ultra!
