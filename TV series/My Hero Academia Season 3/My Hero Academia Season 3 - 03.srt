Welcome to UA High,

00:00:12,333 --> 00:00:13,791
the prestigious school
that's turned out

3
00:00:13,875 --> 00:00:16,125
some of the world's
greatest heroes.

4
00:00:16,208 --> 00:00:18,416
I'm running toward
my dream in these halls.

5
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:20,583
Learning to overcome
obstacles and save people

6
00:00:20,666 --> 00:00:23,000
with a smile on my face.

7
00:00:23,083 --> 00:00:26,041
That's how I'll become the
greatest hero in the world!

[VLAD]
Class A's already training.

13
00:02:06,916 --> 00:02:09,375
You all need to catch up.

14
00:02:09,458 --> 00:02:11,916
Last semester, Class A
was in the spotlight.

15
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,166
Next semester,
it's Class B's turn.

16
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:16,791
From now on, you're
shooting for the top.

17
00:02:16,875 --> 00:02:18,041
Don't let me down!

[TETSUTETSU] We're such
disappointing students!

19
00:02:20,958 --> 00:02:23,458
I get you want everyone
to improve our Quirks.

20
00:02:23,541 --> 00:02:26,166
But we have 20 unique
powers in our class.

21
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:29,208
What kind of training will
help all of us get better?

22
00:02:29,291 --> 00:02:31,583
[KAMAKIRI]
Yeah, can you be more specific?

23
00:02:31,666 --> 00:02:33,250
[VLAD] When your muscle
fibers are overused,

24
00:02:33,333 --> 00:02:35,000
they break and
grow back tougher.

25
00:02:35,083 --> 00:02:37,791
Thicker. Quirks are
the same way.

26
00:02:37,875 --> 00:02:39,791
They improve the harder
you push them.

27
00:02:39,875 --> 00:02:41,916
Stronger after every workout.

28
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,416
In other words, there's
only one thing to do!

29
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,500
You'll have to break yourselves!

Katsuki Bakugo.

33
00:02:57,375 --> 00:02:59,583
He's plunging his hands
into boiling water to expand

34
00:02:59,666 --> 00:03:01,958
his sweat glands, then
creating chain explosions

35
00:03:02,041 --> 00:03:05,083
to increase the scale
of his bangin' attacks.

Shoto Todoroki.

37
00:03:07,041 --> 00:03:08,458
Alternating between
ice and fire,

38
00:03:08,541 --> 00:03:10,625
he's regulating the
temperature of the water.

39
00:03:10,708 --> 00:03:12,416
His body gets
accustomed to the cold

40
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:14,625
and he works on
controlling his flames.

41
00:03:14,708 --> 00:03:17,291
Some day he might be able
to use both at once!

[PRESENT MIC]
Hanta Sero.

43
00:03:20,041 --> 00:03:22,083
Having him produce tape
continuously will increase

44
00:03:22,166 --> 00:03:24,666
his capacity and improve
the tape's tensile strength

45
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:26,125
and shooting speed.

Eijiro Kirishima
and Mashirao Ojiro.

47
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:30,833
Every time Ojiro hits
Kirishima's Hardened skin

48
00:03:30,916 --> 00:03:33,750
with his Tail, both of their

By running his currents
through a high-capacity battery,

00:03:39,041 --> 00:03:42,041
he's learning to handle
larger amounts of electricity.

[PRESENT MIC] Koji Koda.
In order to increase the reach

55
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:48,000
of his Anivoice, he's
doing vocal exercises

56
00:03:48,083 --> 00:03:49,875
to help him build up his range.

57
00:03:49,958 --> 00:03:52,875
It's also good for helping
him to become less shy.

He's building up his body
by blasting Navel Laser.

61
00:03:57,708 --> 00:03:58,916
This increases
the attack's range

62
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,416
and lets him use it
even with tummy issues.

canals used to zero gravity

69
00:04:13,875 --> 00:04:15,500
in an effort to reduce nausea.

He's lifting weights, while
at the same, time scarfing down

Operative types will
be raising your limits,

maxing out your power.

100
00:05:18,333 --> 00:05:21,333
And the rest--you'll mostly
focus on strengthening

101
00:05:21,416 --> 00:05:23,875
body parts related
to your Quirks.

102
00:05:23,958 --> 00:05:25,916
Now normally,
these changes happen

Your class has a lot
of work to do.

106

Once we team up with Class A,
there'll be 40 students here.

107
00:05:34,541 --> 00:05:36,750
That's a whole lot of Quirks
for our homeroom teachers

Were they the Water Hose heroes?

No. It's, um...

But...

241
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,125
I heard a little about
what happened to them.

242
00:10:30,208 --> 00:10:33,291
And based on that
information, I figured...

00:10:33,375 --> 00:10:35,416
I remember reading about
that horrible incident

244
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:38,416

Everyone here's so crazy.

Calling people stupid names
like "hero" and "villain,"

248
00:10:45,541 --> 00:10:47,458
and then killing each
other because of it.

If they hadn't been showing off,
they'd still be here. Idiots.

And these days it's
really uncommon.

He admired heroes so much,
and wanted to be one.

262

Thing is, you can't
usually become a hero

some kinda Quirk.

My friend refused to accept
that, and hoped for a miracle.

So, we might not
be on the same page.

00:13:57,916 --> 00:14:00,041
than the others before
you start whining.

318
00:14:00,125 --> 00:14:01,750
You have much to improve here.

319
00:14:01,833 --> 00:14:03,333
[STUDENTS]
Right. Yes, sir.

320
00:14:03,416 --> 00:14:05,125
[AIZAWA]
Uraraka! Aoyama!

321
00:14:05,208 --> 00:14:06,458
The same goes for you.

322
00:14:06,541 --> 00:14:09,125
Your team didn't fail,
but you were very close.

323
00:14:09,208 --> 00:14:11,291
I'd say you passed the
proverbial finish line

324
00:14:11,375 --> 00:14:12,208
by only a hair.

325
00:14:12,291 --> 00:14:13,708
[OCHACO yelps]
That bad?

326
00:14:13,791 --> 00:14:15,291
<i>Mon dieu</i> .

327
00:14:15,375 --> 00:14:16,625
[AIZAWA]
Don't lose focus.

328
00:14:16,708 --> 00:14:18,625
Each of you can move faster!

329
00:14:18,708 --> 00:14:19,875
And no matter what you're doing,

330
00:14:19,958 --> 00:14:22,208
just remember where
you started from.

331
00:14:22,291 --> 00:14:25,000
Don't forget who
you were before UA.

332
00:14:25,083 --> 00:14:27,083
Always keep in mind
why you're sweating,

333
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:29,333
and why your limits
keep getting tested.

334
00:14:29,416 --> 00:14:31,625
That's what it means to improve.

335
00:14:31,708 --> 00:14:33,041
[KATSUKI]
Where I started.

336
00:14:33,125 --> 00:14:34,333
[TODOROKI]
Who I am.

337
00:14:34,416 --> 00:14:37,125
[IZUKU]
How I got here.

338
00:14:37,208 --> 00:14:39,250
[IZUKU] Hey, that
reminds me, Mr. Aizawa.

339
00:14:39,333 --> 00:14:40,875
It's already the
third day of camp.

340
00:14:40,958 --> 00:14:43,416
[AIZAWA] Weren't you
listening? Stay focused.

341
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,375
[IZUKU] I was just
wondering if All Might--

342
00:14:45,458 --> 00:14:48,791
I mean, the other teachers
from UA will be joining us.

343
00:14:48,875 --> 00:14:51,000
Like I said before
we came out here.

344
00:14:51,083 --> 00:14:53,125
To keep the camp a secret
from the villains,

345
00:14:53,208 --> 00:14:54,875
hardly anyone knows
where we are.

346
00:14:54,958 --> 00:14:57,625
That's why you get to work out
with us four pussycats!

347
00:14:57,708 --> 00:14:59,083
And think about it.

348
00:14:59,166 --> 00:15:01,500
We believe All Might is one
of the League's targets,

349
00:15:01,583 --> 00:15:03,166
so we can't have him here.

350
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:04,958
It's for your own safety.

351
00:15:05,041 --> 00:15:06,208
For better or for worse,

352
00:15:06,291 --> 00:15:08,750
that's what he gets for
standing out so much.

353
00:15:08,833 --> 00:15:10,166
Hah.

354
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:12,833
[IZUKU] Seems like it's mostly
"for worse" these days.

355
00:15:14,916 --> 00:15:16,208
[IZUKU]
So that's it.

356
00:15:16,291 --> 00:15:18,375
All Might won't be
here to help me.

357
00:15:18,458 --> 00:15:20,041
Meow, meow, meow, meow!

358
00:15:20,125 --> 00:15:21,458
More importantly,

359
00:15:21,541 --> 00:15:23,208
tonight's gonna be fun!

360
00:15:23,291 --> 00:15:26,083
We're pitting classes against
each other in a test of courage.

361
00:15:26,166 --> 00:15:28,041
I know you've been
training hard today.

362
00:15:28,125 --> 00:15:30,291
And later, you'll
get to play hard!

363
00:15:30,375 --> 00:15:32,166
How's that for a reward?

364
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:33,833
[KENDO] It just sounds
like more training.

365
00:15:33,916 --> 00:15:36,583
And training in
the dark, no less.

366
00:15:36,666 --> 00:15:38,666
Revelry in the dark.

367
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:41,000
[RIN]
How much can we do in one day?

368
00:15:41,083 --> 00:15:44,750
[laughs] 'Least we get to
beat Class A, am I right?

369
00:15:44,833 --> 00:15:46,208
Don't slack now!

370
00:15:46,291 --> 00:15:48,833
Make sure you keep on pushing
yourself as you work!

371
00:15:48,916 --> 00:15:50,333
[STUDENTS]
Yes, ma'am.

372
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:52,916
Remember... where I came from.

373
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,833
[TIGER]
Hey. You're not Plus Ultra yet.

374
00:15:55,916 --> 00:15:57,708
[IZUKU yelps]
Right!

375
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:00,208
Whoa, Bakugo,

376
00:16:00,291 --> 00:16:01,625
you're really good
with that knife!

377
00:16:01,708 --> 00:16:02,500
It's weird.

378
00:16:02,583 --> 00:16:03,750
What do you mean "it's weird"?

379
00:16:03,833 --> 00:16:06,208
How can you people be so
damn bad at everything?

380
00:16:06,291 --> 00:16:08,333
[KAMINARI] Look at that.
He's not blowing stuff up.

381
00:16:08,416 --> 00:16:10,541
I'm too tired for this.

382
00:16:13,916 --> 00:16:14,875
[TODOROKI]
Did you need All Might

383
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:16,625
for a particular reason?

384
00:16:16,708 --> 00:16:18,583
You asked Mr. Aizawa about him.

385
00:16:18,666 --> 00:16:21,416
Yeah. Um. I did.

386
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:22,750
Because of Kota.

387
00:16:22,833 --> 00:16:24,375
Kota? Who's that?

388
00:16:24,458 --> 00:16:27,041
[IZUKU]
Huh? The boy that's over there.

389
00:16:27,125 --> 00:16:29,916
He's Mandalay's cousin's...

390
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,291
Hold on. Where did he go?

391
00:16:33,375 --> 00:16:35,333
[IZUKU]
Probably to his hideout.

392
00:16:35,416 --> 00:16:39,666
He really doesn't like
being around everyone.

393
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:42,333
[IZUKU] Anyway, Kota
doesn't like heroes.

394
00:16:42,416 --> 00:16:45,166
Actually, he hates the whole
concept of superhumans,

395
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:46,833
Quirks and everything.

396
00:16:46,916 --> 00:16:51,333
I tried to talk to him, but I
think I just made things worse.

397
00:16:51,416 --> 00:16:53,250
I was just wondering what
All Might would have done

398
00:16:53,333 --> 00:16:55,875
to help him if he'd been here.

399
00:16:55,958 --> 00:16:58,458
I mean, what would you
say to him, Todoroki?

400
00:17:00,291 --> 00:17:01,333
It depends.

401
00:17:01,416 --> 00:17:02,958
Of course! Sorry I asked!

402
00:17:03,041 --> 00:17:04,291
To have a complete stranger

403
00:17:04,375 --> 00:17:06,000
try to change your
mindset sounds like

404
00:17:06,083 --> 00:17:08,125
a pretty irritating
conversation.

405
00:17:08,208 --> 00:17:10,208
What matters are actions.

406
00:17:10,291 --> 00:17:13,291
You have to show him what
you're trying to prove. Right?

407
00:17:13,375 --> 00:17:15,625
If you're going to
rely on words alone,

408
00:17:15,708 --> 00:17:18,208
then they'd better
be incredibly powerful.

409
00:17:18,291 --> 00:17:20,416
What you say doesn't
matter near as much

410
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:23,083
as what you actually do.

411
00:17:23,166 --> 00:17:24,333
[ALL MIGHT]
So when I saw this timid,

412
00:17:24,416 --> 00:17:26,333
Quirkless boy try
to save a life,

413
00:17:26,416 --> 00:17:28,541
it inspired me to act, too.

414
00:17:28,625 --> 00:17:32,166
Young man. You, too,
can become a hero.

415
00:17:33,833 --> 00:17:37,541
You're right. I went
about this the wrong way.

416
00:17:37,625 --> 00:17:40,250
How can I, a stranger,
say anything to him?

417
00:17:40,333 --> 00:17:43,250
I don't know what your goal is
when it comes to this child.

418
00:17:43,333 --> 00:17:45,041
But it sounds to me
like you shouldn't be

419
00:17:45,125 --> 00:17:47,750
sticking your nose in
a delicate situation.

420
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:50,750
You tend to cut to the heart
of people's feelings.

421
00:17:50,833 --> 00:17:52,625
It can be annoying.

422
00:17:52,708 --> 00:17:54,833
[IZUKU]
Right. Sorry about that.

423
00:17:54,916 --> 00:17:57,500
[TENYA] You guys!
Your hands aren't moving!

424
00:17:57,583 --> 00:18:00,041
We'll never make the best
stew if you stop now.

425
00:18:01,291 --> 00:18:02,458
[PIXIE-BOB]
Perfect.

426
00:18:02,541 --> 00:18:04,291
We've filled our bellies
and cleaned the dishes.

427
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:06,041
It's time for...

428
00:18:06,125 --> 00:18:07,958
A totally awesome
test of courage!

429
00:18:08,041 --> 00:18:09,750
[KIRISHIMA, SERO, KAMINARI]
We're gonna win!

430
00:18:09,833 --> 00:18:11,000
[AIZAWA]
Not so fast.

431
00:18:11,083 --> 00:18:13,041
It pains me to say it,
but the remedial class

432
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:16,125
will be having lessons
with me tonight instead.

433
00:18:16,208 --> 00:18:17,708
You've gotta be kidding me!

434
00:18:17,791 --> 00:18:18,958
[AIZAWA]
Sorry.

435
00:18:19,041 --> 00:18:20,458
Your training during the
day didn't impress me,

436
00:18:20,541 --> 00:18:22,833
so I'll be using this time, too.

437
00:18:22,916 --> 00:18:24,333
[KAMINARI, SERO]
Oh, give me a break!

438
00:18:24,416 --> 00:18:27,791
[SATO, KIRISHIMA]
I just wanna prove my courage!

439
00:18:27,875 --> 00:18:29,125
Okay. So.

440
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:31,833
Class B is going to start
out as our "scarers."

441
00:18:31,916 --> 00:18:33,208
When they're in place,

442
00:18:33,291 --> 00:18:35,333
Class A will leave in pairs
every three minutes.

443
00:18:35,416 --> 00:18:36,791
There are tags with
your names on them

444
00:18:36,875 --> 00:18:38,166
at the far end of the route.

445
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:41,333
Your goal is to collect those.

446
00:18:41,416 --> 00:18:42,875
Revelry in the dark.

447
00:18:42,958 --> 00:18:44,666
[OCHACO]
Why's he keep saying that?

448
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:46,500
[PIXIE-BOB] Now, those who
are scarers aren't allowed

449
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:47,833
to make physical contact.

450
00:18:47,916 --> 00:18:49,791
Use your Quirks to
terrify the others.

451
00:18:49,875 --> 00:18:50,875
Got it?

452
00:18:50,958 --> 00:18:52,500
The winners are
the creative students

453
00:18:52,583 --> 00:18:54,750
who make the most people
piss their pants.

454
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:56,416
Did we need that visual?

455
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:57,666
I see!

456
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:59,458
They're encouraging us
stoke our imaginations

457
00:18:59,541 --> 00:19:00,666
as we compete with each other,

458
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:02,500
all while showing us
more uses for our Quirks

459
00:19:02,583 --> 00:19:03,625
in the process.

460
00:19:03,708 --> 00:19:05,250
As expected of UA!

461
00:19:05,333 --> 00:19:06,541
All right!

462
00:19:06,625 --> 00:19:08,791
Everyone draw to see
who your partner will be.

463
00:19:08,875 --> 00:19:11,125
[IZUKU] Hm? If we're
in teams of two...

464
00:19:11,208 --> 00:19:12,416
Wait.

465
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:14,916
There are 20 of us,
but five in extra lessons.

466
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:20,375
[IZUKU] One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight?

467
00:19:20,458 --> 00:19:21,791
Okay let's try this again,

468
00:19:21,875 --> 00:19:23,250
I must be missing something.

469
00:19:23,333 --> 00:19:26,333
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight?

470
00:19:26,416 --> 00:19:28,750
[IZUKU yelps]
I'm all alone.

471
00:19:28,833 --> 00:19:30,291
We were randomly assigned.

472
00:19:30,375 --> 00:19:33,750
It's not that nobody
chose you or anything.

473
00:19:33,833 --> 00:19:35,625
Listen up, Tail.

474
00:19:35,708 --> 00:19:38,166
--Trade with me.
--[MINETA] Aoyama.

475
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:40,458
[MINETA] Please switch me
partners, I should be with her!

476
00:19:40,541 --> 00:19:42,750
Wait, what did you call me?

477
00:19:42,833 --> 00:19:44,916
Revelry in the dark.

478
00:19:46,458 --> 00:19:47,166
[JIRO, HAGAKURE scream]

479
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:48,666
[PIXIE-BOB]
Next team!

480
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:53,041
That's you two kittens.
Ribbity and Miss Floater.

481
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:54,750
[JIRO, HAGAKURE screaming]

482
00:19:54,833 --> 00:19:56,708
[OCHACO]
I'm getting scared, Tsu.

483
00:19:56,791 --> 00:19:58,541
And those screams
aren't helping.

484
00:19:58,625 --> 00:20:01,041
[TSUYU]
That's Kyoka and Toru, I think.

485
00:20:01,125 --> 00:20:02,708
Here, take my hand.

486
00:20:02,791 --> 00:20:04,083
Don't be afraid.

487
00:20:04,166 --> 00:20:08,208
We'll look out for each other.
One step at a time.

488
00:20:08,291 --> 00:20:09,750
[OCHACO]
Mm-hm.

489
00:20:11,375 --> 00:20:14,541
[HONENUKI laughs]
Nice going, Kodai,

490
00:20:14,625 --> 00:20:16,541
you managed to scare
everybody so far,

491
00:20:16,625 --> 00:20:17,750
ya big creeper!

492
00:20:17,833 --> 00:20:19,125
[KENDO] Yeah, you're
the star of the night!

493
00:20:19,208 --> 00:20:20,541
[KODAI]
Huh?

494
00:20:20,625 --> 00:20:24,333
I can't get over how funny
Bakugo and Todoroki were.

495
00:20:25,833 --> 00:20:26,666
[KATSUKI, TODOROKI]
Oh.

496
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:27,500
Oh.

497
00:20:27,583 --> 00:20:28,750
Oh.

498
00:20:28,833 --> 00:20:31,000
I thought they were tough.

499
00:20:31,083 --> 00:20:33,083
[KENDO]
Hey. Smell that?

500
00:20:33,166 --> 00:20:35,000
I think there's
something burning nearby.

501
00:20:35,083 --> 00:20:37,625
[HONENUKI]
Huh? Now that you mention it,

502
00:20:37,708 --> 00:20:39,916
it's kinda smoky out here.

503
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,208
Maybe Bakugo and Todoroki
got so scared, they fire--

504
00:20:44,291 --> 00:20:46,083
Honenuki?

505
00:20:46,166 --> 00:20:47,458
[gasps]

506
00:20:47,541 --> 00:20:50,291
[KENDO]
Yui! Don't breathe in!

507
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:52,750
This smoke. It's poisonous!

508
00:20:54,916 --> 00:20:57,000
[PIXIE-BOB] What's this
foul smell in the air?

509
00:20:57,083 --> 00:20:58,333
[IZUKU]
You see that?

510
00:20:58,416 --> 00:20:59,416
[MANDALAY]
Black smoke.

511
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,333
[TENYA]
Has something been set ablaze?

512
00:21:01,416 --> 00:21:03,291
[OJIRO]
Maybe a fire on the mountain?

513
00:21:07,416 --> 00:21:11,375
[DABI]
Now, it begins.

514
00:21:11,458 --> 00:21:12,125
[PIXIE-BOB]
Hey, what's happening?

515
00:21:12,208 --> 00:21:13,458
[MANDALAY]
Pixie-Bob!

516
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:16,333
[DABI]
Take them down.

517
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:20,291
Those who believe they
deserve the title "hero."

518
00:21:20,375 --> 00:21:22,791
[TOGA cackles]

519
00:21:22,875 --> 00:21:25,625
[DABI]
We, the Vanguard Action Squad

520
00:21:25,708 --> 00:21:31,000
of the League of Villains, will
tear them off their pedestals.

521
00:21:31,083 --> 00:21:33,958
[MAGNE] First, let's get
rid of these feral cats.

522
00:21:34,041 --> 00:21:36,250
[MINETA]
What? No way!

523
00:21:36,333 --> 00:21:39,916
I thought they made sure
no one could find us.

524
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,583
So why the heck
are there villains

525
00:21:41,666 --> 00:21:43,208
attacking this place?

526
00:21:43,291 --> 00:21:44,500
Pixie-Bob!

527
00:21:45,541 --> 00:21:47,000
This is bad.

528
00:21:49,833 --> 00:21:52,375
[gasps] Where's Kota?

529
00:23:29,458 --> 00:23:30,875
[IZUKU]
Here's the preview!

530
00:23:30,958 --> 00:23:32,416
The League of Villains
suddenly attack

531
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:33,750
during our test of courage,

532
00:23:33,833 --> 00:23:36,208
and not even Kota can escape
their evil clutches.

533
00:23:36,291 --> 00:23:37,750
To make matters worse,
I'm the only one

534
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:39,333
who knows where he is.

535
00:23:39,416 --> 00:23:41,166
That means it's up
to me to save him.

536
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:42,708
But I have to hurry!

537
00:23:42,791 --> 00:23:44,708
I need to remember
why I want to be a hero

538
00:23:44,791 --> 00:23:46,291
if I'm going to succeed,

539
00:23:46,375 --> 00:23:49,208
and how far I've come
since I first met All Might.

540
00:23:49,291 --> 00:23:51,583
Next time: "My Hero."

541
00:23:51,666 --> 00:23:53,250
With One For All at full power,

542
00:23:53,333 --> 00:23:55,458
hopefully, I can protect
Kota from harm!

543
00:23:55,541 --> 00:23:57,875
Go beyond! Plus Ultra!
