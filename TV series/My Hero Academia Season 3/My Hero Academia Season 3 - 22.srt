Since this was a demerit system

So, why let those people

00:14:38,416 --> 00:14:41,583
Everyone will naturally wish
to increase their influence,

319
00:14:41,666 --> 00:14:44,916
so there will be some
fighting among the factions.

320
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,291
If the scenario
I composed plays out

321
00:14:47,375 --> 00:14:50,041
as I intended it to,
then I know everything

322
00:14:50,125 --> 00:14:52,416
that's going on
outside these walls.

323
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:55,500
Do you know what I
love most about this?

324
00:14:55,583 --> 00:14:57,833
Any rise in crime moving forward

325
00:14:57,916 --> 00:15:01,291
is due to you concealing
your fading strength.

326
00:15:02,541 --> 00:15:06,250
[ALL FOR ONE] And now you
won't be able to save anyone.

327
00:15:06,333 --> 00:15:09,500
You've been relegated to
the sidelines, doomed to watch

328
00:15:09,583 --> 00:15:12,458
society fall apart
as villains flourish

329
00:15:12,541 --> 00:15:14,625
because of your own arrogance.

330
00:15:14,708 --> 00:15:17,375
Powerless for the
rest of your days.

331
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:22,125
So, tell me. How does
that feel, hero?

332
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:25,500
[PRISON GUARD 60A] All Might,
don't approach the glass.

333
00:15:25,583 --> 00:15:26,916
[ALL FOR ONE]
That's all I needed.

334
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,791
I can see it written
on your face.

335
00:15:29,875 --> 00:15:31,083
You're nothing now.

336
00:15:31,166 --> 00:15:32,125
You're finished.

337
00:15:32,208 --> 00:15:34,625
Bet you really wanna
punch me, huh?

338
00:15:36,125 --> 00:15:37,541
[inhales]

339
00:15:37,625 --> 00:15:39,166
You think you know everything.

340
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:42,583
But as always,
you underestimate people.

341
00:15:42,666 --> 00:15:44,708
[ALL FOR ONE] I kept wondering
what would annihilate

342
00:15:44,791 --> 00:15:47,041
your golden heart.

343
00:15:47,125 --> 00:15:50,083
[ALL MIGHT] I understand
your twisted plan very well.

344
00:15:50,166 --> 00:15:53,791
You want Shigaraki, my master's
blood relation, to kill me.

345
00:15:53,875 --> 00:15:56,791
Or kill me and Young Midoriya.

346
00:15:56,875 --> 00:15:59,166
That's what you plotted.

347
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:01,833
Perhaps.

348
00:16:01,916 --> 00:16:02,916
[GRAN TORINO]
You're not looking at him

349
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,625
like the villain he is anymore.

350
00:16:04,708 --> 00:16:06,166
That's dangerous.

351
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:09,916
Remember that, no matter his
lineage, he's still a criminal.

352
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,416
I won't be dying anytime soon.

353
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:17,708
Especially not by
Shigaraki's hand.

354
00:16:17,791 --> 00:16:20,125
I will not be killed so easily.

355
00:16:20,208 --> 00:16:24,916
And I refuse to let the future
you imagine come to pass.

356
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,708
You said you came to set
a few things straight.

357
00:16:27,791 --> 00:16:31,000
But this is really what
you wanted to say.

358
00:16:31,083 --> 00:16:33,625
[PRISON GUARD 60A]
Time's up, sir. Please exit.

359
00:16:34,583 --> 00:16:36,083
I'll smash your plans.

360
00:16:36,166 --> 00:16:39,541
And thwart your plots.
I am relentless.

361
00:16:39,625 --> 00:16:41,666
You're the one who'll
watch helpless from a cell

362
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:44,125
for the rest of your days.

363
00:16:44,208 --> 00:16:47,958
[ALL FOR ONE cackles]
Rest of my days, huh?

364
00:16:54,791 --> 00:16:56,041
[phone chimes]

365
00:16:56,125 --> 00:16:57,291
Excuse me.

366

[gasps]

367
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,750
[ALL MIGHT]
Young Midoriya!

368
00:17:10,833 --> 00:17:13,166
[JIRO] So, we're back to normal
classes tomorrow, right?

369
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:15,416
I suppose there's
no rest for heroes.

370
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:17,791
[SATO]
Man, I could use a vacation.

371
00:17:17,875 --> 00:17:20,666
[TOKOYAMI] I'll not forget this
summer the rest of my life.

372
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:23,916
[IZUKU] It's been a bit.
I wonder if he got my message.

373
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,208
--[KATSUKI] You.
--[gasps]

374
00:17:25,291 --> 00:17:27,291
Meet me out front later.

375
00:17:28,791 --> 00:17:31,791
We need to have a talk
about your Quirk.

376
00:17:31,875 --> 00:17:33,500
[IZUKU gasps]

377
00:17:33,583 --> 00:17:35,916
Um. Okay.

378
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,083
[IZUKU]
Kacchan.

379
00:17:51,166 --> 00:17:52,625
How far are we going?

380
00:17:52,708 --> 00:17:55,250
We shouldn't be walking around
in the middle of the night.

381
00:17:57,208 --> 00:17:58,541
Hello?

382
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:02,916
[IZUKU]
Wow, you're so lucky!

383
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,166
Your Quirk is amazing, Kacchan.

384
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:07,666
When I get mine, I hope
it's just as cool!

385
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:09,666
[KATSUKI] Whatever, Deku,
no matter what power

386
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:12,666
you end up with, you'll
never be able to beat me.

387
00:18:14,583 --> 00:18:17,041
[IZUKU]
You brought us to Ground Beta?

388
00:18:17,125 --> 00:18:18,250
[KATSUKI]
This is the place where we had

389
00:18:18,333 --> 00:18:19,958
our first combat training.

390
00:18:20,041 --> 00:18:21,791
Where I fought you and lost.

391
00:18:21,875 --> 00:18:22,625
[gasps]

392
00:18:22,708 --> 00:18:23,958
You've always made me sick.

393
00:18:24,041 --> 00:18:26,333
You know that, right, Deku?

394
00:18:26,416 --> 00:18:29,458
[IZUKU]
Somehow I knew. This was it.

395
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:30,625
[KATSUKI]
You were useless.

396
00:18:30,708 --> 00:18:33,041
No power at all. A joke.

397
00:18:33,125 --> 00:18:34,375
So now you're gonna tell me

398
00:18:34,458 --> 00:18:36,375
how you managed to get
into this damn school

399
00:18:36,458 --> 00:18:39,916
with a brand-new Quirk that
appeared outta nowhere.

400
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,833
[IZUKU] I wasn't hiding
my Quirk from you.

401
00:18:41,916 --> 00:18:45,333
It was given to me by
someone else. Recently.

402
00:18:47,291 --> 00:18:51,083
I'll work until I have full
control of this borrowed Quirk.

403
00:18:51,166 --> 00:18:54,291
And I'll finally beat
you with my own power!

404
00:18:54,375 --> 00:18:56,291
I didn't understand
what you meant back then

405
00:18:56,375 --> 00:18:58,458
because what you were
saying made no sense.

406
00:18:58,541 --> 00:19:00,750
But still, you kept
climbing higher and higher,

407
00:19:00,833 --> 00:19:03,958
always looking so
satisfied with yourself.

408
00:19:05,208 --> 00:19:07,791
[KATSUKI]
Ever since that sludge villain.

409
00:19:07,875 --> 00:19:11,375
No, it actually started
when All Might came to town.

410
00:19:11,458 --> 00:19:13,041
Better and better.

411
00:19:13,125 --> 00:19:17,458
Until finally, you passed the
licensing exam while I failed.

412
00:19:17,541 --> 00:19:19,666
How the hell is
that even possible?

413
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:21,250
[IZUKU] That wasn't a matter
of ability, though.

414
00:19:21,333 --> 00:19:23,416
[KATSUKI] Shut up and
listen, you damn nerd.

415
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,250
[IZUKU]
Sorry.

416
00:19:25,333 --> 00:19:26,958
[KATSUKI] It pissed me off
that I'd been beaten

417
00:19:27,041 --> 00:19:29,250
by such a pathetic weakling.

418
00:19:29,333 --> 00:19:30,958
But after seeing what
happened to All Might

419
00:19:31,041 --> 00:19:34,000
at Kamino Ward,
I began to understand.

420
00:19:34,083 --> 00:19:38,291
It looks like you've made
that borrowed power your own.

421
00:19:38,375 --> 00:19:39,750
[IZUKU gulps]

422
00:19:39,833 --> 00:19:41,916
[IZUKU]
Here goes.

423
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,166
I've been giving it
a lot of thought.

424
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:46,458
You got your Quirk from
All Might, didn't you?

425
00:19:46,541 --> 00:19:48,583
He gave you his power.

426
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:52,208
I heard about the boss villain.

427
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:55,291
Apparently he has the ability
to steal a person's Quirk

428
00:19:55,375 --> 00:19:56,958
and give it to somebody else.

429
00:19:57,041 --> 00:19:58,666
Which sounds kinda
crazy, but then

430
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:00,625
one of those old cat
ladies had her power

431
00:20:00,708 --> 00:20:03,041
taken from her and
can't work anymore.

432
00:20:03,125 --> 00:20:04,708
And then you met All Might.

433
00:20:04,791 --> 00:20:06,625
And you started changing.

434
00:20:06,708 --> 00:20:09,875
Then he lost his power and
had to retire, just like her.

435
00:20:11,541 --> 00:20:12,625
[KATSUKI]
I remember what he said

436
00:20:12,708 --> 00:20:16,166
after he beat the big bad.
We all heard it.

437
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:18,875
[ALL MIGHT]
Now, it's your turn.

438
00:20:18,958 --> 00:20:20,583
[KATSUKI]
Back then,

439
00:20:20,666 --> 00:20:24,250
you were the only one who really
understood what he meant.

440
00:20:24,333 --> 00:20:25,583
There's more evidence, too,

441
00:20:25,666 --> 00:20:28,250
like how those Nomu monsters
had multiple Quirks.

442
00:20:28,333 --> 00:20:30,958
Even though it
seemed impossible.

443
00:20:31,041 --> 00:20:32,333
Besides...

444
00:20:32,416 --> 00:20:35,875
[ALL FOR ONE]
You've gotten weaker, All Might.

445
00:20:35,958 --> 00:20:37,291
I'll make certain
you're locked up

446
00:20:37,375 --> 00:20:39,041
for the rest of your life.

447
00:20:39,125 --> 00:20:41,833
[KATSUKI] All Might and that
boss villain knew each other.

448
00:20:41,916 --> 00:20:43,416
Before that fight.

449
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:46,000
Quirks can move from
one person to another.

450
00:20:46,083 --> 00:20:48,250
All Might knew the guy
that could do it.

451
00:20:48,333 --> 00:20:50,541
And somehow it's all
connected to what you said

452
00:20:50,625 --> 00:20:53,250
about getting your Quirk
from someone else.

453
00:20:56,208 --> 00:20:59,500
[KATSUKI] I asked All Might
about this, in a way.

454
00:20:59,583 --> 00:21:03,750
But he wouldn't give
me a straight answer.

455
00:21:03,833 --> 00:21:07,583
That's why you're gonna
tell me the truth.

456
00:21:07,666 --> 00:21:08,875
[ALL MIGHT]
Don't look so sad.

457
00:21:08,958 --> 00:21:10,208
He didn't take you seriously,

458
00:21:10,291 --> 00:21:11,791
so I don't think
he'll say anything.

459
00:21:11,875 --> 00:21:13,458
This time, I'll
let things slide.

460
00:21:13,541 --> 00:21:16,125
Just make sure this
doesn't happen again.

461
00:21:16,208 --> 00:21:18,166
You're not trying
to deny anything.

462
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:22,375
Which means I must
be right. So say it.

463
00:21:22,458 --> 00:21:24,875
[IZUKU] When he said he
wanted to talk about my Quirk,

464
00:21:24,958 --> 00:21:27,166
I knew what was coming.

465
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:29,083
This is the price I pay
for not following

466
00:21:29,166 --> 00:21:32,000
All Might's instructions.

467
00:21:32,083 --> 00:21:34,791
Okay. What if it's true?

468
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:38,500
You and I both wanted
to be just like All Might

469
00:21:38,583 --> 00:21:40,083
when we were growing up.

470
00:21:40,166 --> 00:21:43,041
But I was the one
who had the potential.

471
00:21:43,125 --> 00:21:45,000
Then somehow, a little
nobody like you

472
00:21:45,083 --> 00:21:47,791
was singled out by the
person I admired most,

473
00:21:47,875 --> 00:21:50,166
and I didn't even realize it.

474
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:52,708
That's why we're here.

475
00:21:52,791 --> 00:21:54,750
You and I are settling this.

476
00:21:54,833 --> 00:21:57,458
Right here. Right now.

477
00:23:29,666 --> 00:23:30,875
[IZUKU]
Here's the preview!

478
00:23:30,958 --> 00:23:32,708
Kacchan and I have both
admired All Might

479
00:23:32,791 --> 00:23:35,083
with our whole hearts,
since we were little kids.

480
00:23:35,166 --> 00:23:37,625
That's why it's hard to see
the meaning in this fight.

481
00:23:37,708 --> 00:23:40,291
No matter who wins,
what is there to be gained?

482
00:23:40,375 --> 00:23:42,875
Still, I have to go
through with it.

483
00:23:42,958 --> 00:23:45,458
In a way, I think
I owe it to Kacchan.

484
00:23:45,541 --> 00:23:48,875
After all, we've been
through so much together.

485
00:23:48,958 --> 00:23:51,750
Next time: "Deku vs.
Kacchan, Part 2."

486
00:23:51,833 --> 00:23:53,833
Right now, I'm the only
person who can understand

487
00:23:53,916 --> 00:23:55,875
how Kacchan must be feeling.

488
00:23:55,958 --> 00:23:58,500
Go beyond! Plus Ultra!
