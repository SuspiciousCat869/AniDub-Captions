00:00:10,375 --> 00:00:12,958
[IZUKU] Welcome to UA High,
the prestigious school

2
00:00:13,041 --> 00:00:16,083
that's turned out some of
the world's greatest heroes.

3
00:00:16,166 --> 00:00:18,250
I'm running toward my
dream in these halls.

4
00:00:18,333 --> 00:00:19,666
Learning to overcome obstacles

5
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:22,833
and save people with
a smile on my face.

6
00:00:22,916 --> 00:00:25,958
That's how I'll become the
greatest hero in the world!

7
00:01:59,833 --> 00:02:01,708
[REPORTER 47A] You spoke about
keeping the students safe,

8
00:02:01,791 --> 00:02:03,083
Eraser Head.

9
00:02:03,166 --> 00:02:04,708
But according to our
information, you encouraged them

10
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:06,916
to fight during the attack
on the training camp,

11
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,916
putting them in grave danger.

12
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,041
What was your
reasoning for this?

13
00:02:11,125 --> 00:02:14,166
I concluded that because we
didn't know the full situation.

14
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:15,833
Allowing them to use
their Quirks would help

15
00:02:15,916 --> 00:02:17,500
avoid the worst
possible outcome.

16
00:02:17,583 --> 00:02:19,625
And what would that outcome be?

17
00:02:19,708 --> 00:02:22,250
Do you think 26 victims
and one kidnapped child

18
00:02:22,333 --> 00:02:24,541
is a win for UA High?

19
00:02:24,625 --> 00:02:26,208
I assure you that
things could have gone

20
00:02:26,291 --> 00:02:28,666
much more poorly.
I feared every student

21
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:30,708
would be tortured and
killed in the end.

22
00:02:30,791 --> 00:02:33,666
Most of the victims were
harmed by the gas attack.

23
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:36,333
We've determined it to be the
result of a poisonous Quirk

24
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:37,791
used by one of the villains.

25
00:02:37,875 --> 00:02:39,875
It's thanks to the quick
actions of Ms. Kendo

26
00:02:39,958 --> 00:02:43,291
and Mr. Tetsutetsu that injuries
were kept to a bare minimum.

27
00:02:43,375 --> 00:02:45,625
Additionally, we're providing
mental health counseling

28
00:02:45,708 --> 00:02:47,333
to every student,
though at the moment,

29
00:02:47,416 --> 00:02:50,583
we do not see any signs of
serious psychological trauma.

30
00:02:50,666 --> 00:02:52,833
So you've found a bright
spot in this tragedy?

31
00:02:52,916 --> 00:02:54,625
We're relieved that
an entire class

32
00:02:54,708 --> 00:02:56,916
of burgeoning heroes
still has a future.

33
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:57,916
Can you say the same thing

34
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,166
for the abducted,
Katsuki Bakugo?

35
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:03,416
He enrolled at your school
with excellent marks,

36
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:05,833
and went on to win
the sports festival.

37
00:03:05,916 --> 00:03:07,375
Before that, he
survived the attack

38
00:03:07,458 --> 00:03:09,291
of a powerful sludge
villain who eventually

39
00:03:09,375 --> 00:03:11,291
had to be taken down
by All Might.

40
00:03:11,375 --> 00:03:14,041
The boy is obviously
strong and heroic.

41
00:03:14,125 --> 00:03:16,791
On the other hand, the violence
he displayed in the finals

42
00:03:16,875 --> 00:03:18,750
and his attitude at
the awards ceremony

43
00:03:18,833 --> 00:03:21,625
both showed that he
cannot control his temper.

44
00:03:21,708 --> 00:03:24,958
What if this is the real reason
the villains kidnapped him?

45
00:03:25,041 --> 00:03:27,375
What if they're brainwashing
Bakugo right now,

46
00:03:27,458 --> 00:03:29,875
pulling him toward
the path of evil?

47
00:03:29,958 --> 00:03:31,458
How can you sit
there and tell us

48
00:03:31,541 --> 00:03:33,375
he still has a future?

49
00:03:33,458 --> 00:03:36,250
[VLAD KING] This reporter knows
exactly what he's doing.

50
00:03:36,333 --> 00:03:39,875
He's trying to antagonize us
so we say something damning.

51
00:03:39,958 --> 00:03:42,125
You can't fall for it, Eraser.

52
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:45,833
He probably knows how much
you hate the media.

53
00:03:45,916 --> 00:03:48,000
Don't let him trick you.

54
00:03:50,791 --> 00:03:52,875
[AIZAWA]
As Katsuki Bakugo's teacher,

55
00:03:52,958 --> 00:03:57,125
I take full responsibility for
not taming his violent behavior.

56
00:03:57,208 --> 00:04:00,041
However, his actions
at the sports festival

57
00:04:00,125 --> 00:04:03,208
were born of his
deep-seated convictions.

58
00:04:03,291 --> 00:04:05,458
He's trying harder than
anyone in his pursuit

59
00:04:05,541 --> 00:04:07,833
to become the top hero.

60
00:04:07,916 --> 00:04:10,250
If the villains think they
have a chance with him,

61
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:11,958
then they are grossly mistaken.

62
00:04:12,041 --> 00:04:14,583
I can guarantee you that much.

63
00:04:14,666 --> 00:04:16,958
That doesn't amount to
real evidence, though.

64
00:04:17,041 --> 00:04:18,541
I didn't ask you how you feel,

65
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:21,333
I asked you if you had
concrete information.

66
00:04:21,416 --> 00:04:22,916
We're doing our best
with the intel

67
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,541
we currently have available.

68
00:04:24,625 --> 00:04:28,083
I have no doubt the police
will break this case very soon.

69
00:04:28,166 --> 00:04:30,125
We won't rest until
our missing student

70
00:04:30,208 --> 00:04:31,458
is returned to UA.

71
00:04:31,541 --> 00:04:33,958
Hah! Did ya hear the teachers?

72
00:04:34,041 --> 00:04:36,125
They get me more than I thought.

73
00:04:36,208 --> 00:04:39,458
I'll never join your
league of bastards!

74
00:04:39,541 --> 00:04:40,916
[KATSUKI] They went through
the trouble of mounting

75
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,875
a huge attack, all just
to bring me back here.

76
00:04:44,958 --> 00:04:46,833
The idiots even told me
what they wanted.

77
00:04:46,916 --> 00:04:49,083
For me to join their
pathetic group.

78
00:04:49,166 --> 00:04:51,125
Which means I know
they won't kill me.

79
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:53,708
What a bunch of amateurs.

80
00:04:53,791 --> 00:04:55,000
Now's my chance.

81
00:04:55,083 --> 00:04:57,125
I gotta take a couple
of 'em down quick,

82
00:04:57,208 --> 00:04:58,666
and get the hell outta here.

83
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:02,250
We may not be at camp,
but I'm still allowed to fight!

84
00:05:02,333 --> 00:05:04,625
He must've figured out
he's important to us.

85
00:05:04,708 --> 00:05:05,916
What a clever boy.

86
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,416
No. He's a fool.

87
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:09,750
Let me stab him.

88
00:05:09,833 --> 00:05:11,333
[MR. COMPRESS] A clever
performer would've acted

89
00:05:11,416 --> 00:05:12,833
like we were winning him over.

90
00:05:12,916 --> 00:05:15,375
Now that he's broken
character, he's finished.

91
00:05:15,458 --> 00:05:17,208
I only do whatever I want to,

92
00:05:17,291 --> 00:05:19,291
and I won't even
pretend otherwise.

93
00:05:19,375 --> 00:05:20,625
And I'm tired of
being surrounded

94
00:05:20,708 --> 00:05:23,291
by a bunch of lame-ass wannabes.

95
00:05:25,791 --> 00:05:27,583
[SHIGARAKI]
Father.

96
00:05:27,666 --> 00:05:30,041
[KUROGIRI]
No, Tomura Shigaraki. Be calm.

97
00:05:34,041 --> 00:05:37,458
Don't lay a finger
on him. Any of you.

98
00:05:41,125 --> 00:05:43,166
This "hero"...

99
00:05:44,833 --> 00:05:47,375
[SHIGARAKI]
...is still a valuable piece.

100
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,791
[SHIGARAKI] I wish you would've
listened to what I had to say.

101
00:05:52,875 --> 00:05:56,208
I thought you and I could
come to an understanding.

102
00:05:56,291 --> 00:05:57,166
[BEST JEANIST]
Heroes and villains

103
00:05:57,250 --> 00:05:59,375
are cut from the same cloth.

104
00:05:59,458 --> 00:06:01,333
What, you think we're the same?

105
00:06:01,416 --> 00:06:03,875
Not a chance.

106
00:06:03,958 --> 00:06:06,166
[SHIGARAKI]
Then I have no choice.

107
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:08,791
The heroes said they'd
continue their investigation

108
00:06:08,875 --> 00:06:12,833
of our group, so we don't have
time to stand here and talk.

109
00:06:12,916 --> 00:06:14,958
Master.

110
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:17,125
Lend me your power.

111
00:06:18,208 --> 00:06:22,416
That is a wise decision,
Tomura Shigaraki.

112
00:06:35,333 --> 00:06:38,000
Okay, this is the spot the
tracker is broadcasting from.

113
00:06:38,083 --> 00:06:41,375
So that's their hideout?
Not a bad one, I guess.

114
00:06:41,458 --> 00:06:43,375
[YAOYOROZU]
Maybe it is and maybe it isn't.

115
00:06:43,458 --> 00:06:44,916
According to the
tracking history,

116
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,583
the villain hasn't left this
location for the past day.

117
00:06:47,666 --> 00:06:49,458
But that's all we know.

118
00:06:49,541 --> 00:06:51,875
One villain is hiding here,
but that could be it.

119
00:06:51,958 --> 00:06:54,041
They might have Bakugo
somewhere else.

120
00:06:54,125 --> 00:06:56,458
We're going into this
operation completely blind

121
00:06:56,541 --> 00:07:00,166
for the most part. Please
try to proceed logically.

122
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:01,458
I don't like this.

123
00:07:01,541 --> 00:07:03,541
None of us are good
at sneaking around.

124
00:07:03,625 --> 00:07:06,041
We need Hagakure or Jiro here.

125
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:08,125
If I think things are gonna
be the least bit dangerous,

126
00:07:08,208 --> 00:07:09,375
we're done.

127
00:07:09,458 --> 00:07:11,500
I won't hesitate to
call the police, either.

128

To make sure my
friends are safe.

[IZUKU]
Thank you, Iida.

130
00:07:16,708 --> 00:07:19,291
So, what can we do with
what's in front of us?

131
00:07:19,375 --> 00:07:20,833
Let me see here.

132
00:07:20,916 --> 00:07:22,666
[mumbling] The prerequisite is
that we don't use our Quirks

133
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:24,166
to fight the villains,
and on top of that,

134
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:25,750
we need to figure out...

135
00:07:25,833 --> 00:07:27,166
[KIRISHIMA] It's been a while
since I've seen him this weird.

00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:29,416
[YAOYOROZU] Yeah, this is
truly peak Midoriya.

137
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:30,833
[TENYA]
That's right.

138
00:07:30,916 --> 00:07:32,208
Once you set your
heart on something,

00:07:32,291 --> 00:07:35,083
there's no swaying you.
You won't stop.

140
00:07:35,166 --> 00:07:37,166
It's what I respect
about you as a friend.

141
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:38,416
And a rival.

142
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,875
But there must be boundaries.

143
00:07:40,958 --> 00:07:43,958
And someone has to make
sure you don't cross them.

144
00:07:44,041 --> 00:07:47,000
This time, I'll protect you.

145
00:07:48,166 --> 00:07:50,833
[ENDEAVOR]
Why should I clean up UA's mess?

146
00:07:50,916 --> 00:07:53,458
I'm a very busy man,
as you know.

147
00:07:53,541 --> 00:07:55,333
[BEST JEANIST]
Get off your high horse.

148
00:07:55,416 --> 00:07:57,583
You are a UA alum.

We can't call any heroes
away from the school.

There is a bigger
picture, Endeavor.

It's possible this incident

153
00:08:05,666 --> 00:08:08,500
is the beginning of the
end for Hero society.

154
00:08:08,583 --> 00:08:11,458
We'll stop at nothing
to resolve this successfully.

155
00:08:11,541 --> 00:08:12,875
[BEST JEANIST]
During the internships,

156
00:08:12,958 --> 00:08:16,375
I invited Bakugo to my agency
to try and reform him.

157
00:08:16,458 --> 00:08:18,875
I've met very few
as stubborn as he is.

158
00:08:18,958 --> 00:08:20,833
I imagine he's fighting back.

159
00:08:20,916 --> 00:08:22,666
We need to hurry.

160
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:25,333
[GANG ORCA] Not even you were
able to change his behavior.

161
00:08:25,416 --> 00:08:26,791
[BEST JEANIST]
Yes. He was inflexible,

162
00:08:26,875 --> 00:08:28,666
pride sewn into his very core.

163
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:31,541
My comrade, Ragdoll,
was also taken.

164
00:08:31,625 --> 00:08:33,291
This is my chance
to get her back.

165
00:08:33,375 --> 00:08:34,708
[TSUKAUCHI] Thanks to
the tracking devices set

166
00:08:34,791 --> 00:08:36,916
by one of the students,
we now believe there are

167
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,416
two separate hideout locations.

168
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:40,833
We know from our investigations

169
00:08:40,916 --> 00:08:43,416
where the kidnapped
victim is located.

170
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,375
We'll send the bulk
of our forces there.

171
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:47,958
Retrieving Bakugo
is our priority.

172
00:08:48,041 --> 00:08:49,125
At the same time,

173
00:08:49,208 --> 00:08:50,583
we'll gain control
of the other hideout.

174
00:08:50,666 --> 00:08:52,458
This will cut off
their paths of retreat.

175
00:08:52,541 --> 00:08:54,416
We'll arrest them all at once.

176
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:55,666
[GRAN TORINO]
Toshinori.

177
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:57,916
If they're recruiting
old men like me, then...

178
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
What are you suggesting?

179
00:08:59,083 --> 00:09:01,416
You're still Gran Torino.

180
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,958
And with such staggering
stakes at hand.

181
00:09:04,041 --> 00:09:06,916
We can be sure that
<i>he</i> is involved.

182
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,750
All For One.

183
00:09:09,833 --> 00:09:11,375
We have the element of surprise!

184
00:09:11,458 --> 00:09:13,625
These villains will not succeed!

185
00:09:13,708 --> 00:09:15,083
At the press
conference earlier,

186
00:09:15,166 --> 00:09:16,875
we had Principal Nezu
act clueless

187
00:09:16,958 --> 00:09:18,625
to deceive the villains.

188
00:09:18,708 --> 00:09:22,958
He feigned ignorance on camera,
as if we didn't have leads.

189
00:09:23,041 --> 00:09:24,541
After hearing his words,

190
00:09:24,625 --> 00:09:28,041
the villains won't expect us
to rush in on the very same day.

191
00:09:28,125 --> 00:09:32,416
We'll retaliate! It's time
for our counterattack!

192
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:35,458
Remind the world what
you can do, Heroes!

193
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:47,625
We've gotten pretty close,

194
00:09:47,708 --> 00:09:49,791
but I haven't seen
anything move inside.

195
00:09:49,875 --> 00:09:51,708
And not a single light is on.

196
00:09:51,791 --> 00:09:53,416
It doesn't look
like anyone's home.

197
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:56,083
They're hiding this
lair in plain sight.

198
00:09:56,166 --> 00:09:58,125
It looks like any other
abandoned warehouse.

199
00:09:58,208 --> 00:09:59,458
[IZUKU]
The weeds under the front door

200
00:09:59,541 --> 00:10:01,125
are thick and undisturbed.

201
00:10:01,208 --> 00:10:02,958
There must be another
way to get in.

202
00:10:03,041 --> 00:10:04,916
Maybe someone's
Quirk is hiding it.

203
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,541
We can't just enter carelessly.
It could be a trap.

204
00:10:07,625 --> 00:10:09,125
If we could just
see inside somehow...

205
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:11,708
[DRUNK MAN 47A] Hey. You lookin'
for a real man, darlin'?

206
00:10:11,791 --> 00:10:12,916
I'm good.

207
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,791
Ditch these losers
and come drink with us.

208
00:10:14,875 --> 00:10:16,833
Come on, don't go
pickin' fights.

209
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:18,583
[IZUKU]
Hey! You talkin' ta us?

210
00:10:18,666 --> 00:10:20,250
Let's get out of here.

211
00:10:22,541 --> 00:10:24,708
It's not crowded, but
there are people around.

212
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:26,833
We can't draw
attention to ourselves.

213
00:10:26,916 --> 00:10:29,375
So what's our next move?

214
00:10:29,458 --> 00:10:30,791
[IZUKU]
Let's go around the back.

215
00:10:30,875 --> 00:10:32,416
It might be the best
chance we have to get

216
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:34,666
some solid intel on this place.

217
00:10:39,875 --> 00:10:42,750
This is so narrow.
I might get stuck.

218
00:10:42,833 --> 00:10:44,458
Just keep moving.
We have to figure out

219
00:10:44,541 --> 00:10:45,958
what's happening inside.

220
00:10:46,041 --> 00:10:47,916
No one will see us
from back here.

221
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,416
[gasps] There!

222
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,500
We should be able to get
a look through that window.

223
00:10:51,583 --> 00:10:53,500
We'll be blind in the darkness.

224
00:10:53,583 --> 00:10:55,541
One second, I'll make
a night vision scope.

225
00:10:55,625 --> 00:10:57,541
Wait. No need.

226
00:10:57,625 --> 00:10:59,625
I actually brought one
along with me for this.

227
00:10:59,708 --> 00:11:01,666
[IZUKU]
Whoa, really?

228
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:03,833
When I thought about
what we'd have to do,

229
00:11:03,916 --> 00:11:05,666
I figured we might need it.

230
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:08,375
Sure, but aren't those
models super expensive?

231
00:11:08,458 --> 00:11:10,083
I did some research on
them when I was thinking

232
00:11:10,166 --> 00:11:12,166
about my costume, but,
they cost, like,

233
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:13,916
50,000 or something, right?

234

[KIRISHIMA]
Whatever, man. Just drop it.

235
00:11:16,291 --> 00:11:19,625
Right. Then Kirishima
will serve as our scout.

236
00:11:19,708 --> 00:11:21,625
Back him up, Midoriya.

237

Don't lean forward too much.

at a moment's notice.

[KIRISHIMA] Iida, can you
move back a little?

241
00:11:30,583 --> 00:11:32,166

Tell us what you see inside.

00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:33,708
Quickly. And be quiet!

is pretty trashed.

00:23:42,916 --> 00:23:44,666
In the face of his
terrifying presence,

473
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:46,708
fear has us unable to move,

474
00:23:46,791 --> 00:23:49,166
even though Kacchan is
right in front of us!

475
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:51,583
Next time: "Symbol of Peace"!

476
00:23:51,666 --> 00:23:54,000
Everything's okay now. Why?

477
00:23:54,083 --> 00:23:55,625
Because <i>he</i> is here!

478
00:23:55,708 --> 00:23:58,000
Go beyond! Plus Ultra!
