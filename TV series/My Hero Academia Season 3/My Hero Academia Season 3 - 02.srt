Every time we've driven
the villains back,

00:00:20,083 --> 00:00:22,708
they've retreated to the
safety of the shadows,

[SHIGARAKI]
The Master is good.

8
00:00:31,541 --> 00:00:34,458
I tried so hard to find out
where those idiots were going,

9
00:00:34,541 --> 00:00:36,708
and he figured it out
in an instant.

00:00:36,791 --> 00:00:38,875
Guess he really showed me up.

[KUROGIRI] It was worth
having a team on standby,

[GIRAN] I heard back
from the union today.

You can expect
a delivery tomorrow.

17
00:00:53,541 --> 00:00:56,458
It was thrown together quickly,
so it might not look like much.

18
00:00:56,541 --> 00:00:58,625
But quality is guaranteed.

19
00:00:58,708 --> 00:01:00,166
[KUROGIRI]
I must apologize for making

20
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:02,500
such an unreasonable request.

21
00:01:02,583 --> 00:01:04,416
Tell me, Shigaraki.

22
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,041
Do you know why
the union accepted

23
00:01:06,125 --> 00:01:09,000
this outlandish order of yours?

'Cause everyone's got
high expectations of you.

steps into the light,

then the scum hiding on the
sidelines will follow suit.

27
00:01:17,041 --> 00:01:20,083
And if that happens, it means
brokers like me win big.

28

in new customers.

Oh, yes.

Don't think these
will be months of rest

for you heroes-in-the-making.

At this camp,

we'll push you to
go beyond your limits.

[IZUKU] Wow. Uraraka and
the others sure are excited.

I heard some of Class A
is taking extra courses.

67
00:04:19,791 --> 00:04:23,000
Does that mean they actually
failed the final exams?

That must be so embarrassing.

Especially since you're
supposed to be

so much better than my class.

It's nice to see you outside
of the sports festival.

technically rivals.

00:14:23,416 --> 00:14:24,750
[AIZAWA]
Enough playing around.

320
00:14:24,833 --> 00:14:26,791
Get your stuff off the bus.

321
00:14:26,875 --> 00:14:28,208
Once your bags
are in your rooms,

322
00:14:28,291 --> 00:14:30,000
we'll have dinner
in the cafeteria.

323
00:14:30,083 --> 00:14:32,166
After that, you can
bathe and sleep.

324
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:34,708
Tomorrow your training
starts in earnest.

325
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:36,541
You'd better get a move on.

326
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,000
It looks so good!

327
00:14:43,875 --> 00:14:45,333
[SERO]
So,

328
00:14:45,416 --> 00:14:47,458
you girls got stuck in a tiny
little bunk room, didn't ya?

329
00:14:47,541 --> 00:14:49,166
Why? Is the guys'
room really big?

330
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:50,500
[ASHIDO]
Oh, yeah?

331
00:14:50,583 --> 00:14:52,208
So, like, can I come
check it out later or what?

332
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:53,833
[SERO]
Sure! Whenever you want.

333
00:14:53,916 --> 00:14:56,250
[KIRISHIMA] It's so good.
I can't get enough!

334
00:14:56,333 --> 00:14:57,916
[KAMINARI] My stomach
is so happy right now.

335
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,625
It's as good as
Lunch Rush's food!

336
00:14:59,708 --> 00:15:01,250
I think I might eat
until I burst.

337
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:03,208
[KAMINARI gasps]
I smell beef.

338
00:15:03,291 --> 00:15:04,916
Hey, wait, you got
meat over there?

339
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,500
[PIXIE-BOB]
Yeah.

340
00:15:06,583 --> 00:15:09,791
Jeez, it's like you guys haven't
eaten in a week or something.

341
00:15:09,875 --> 00:15:12,500
Anyway, today's the only time
we'll be doing this for you.

342
00:15:12,583 --> 00:15:14,000
So make sure you kids enjoy it.

343
00:15:14,083 --> 00:15:15,583
[KAMINARI, KIRISHIMA]
Thank you!

344
00:15:15,666 --> 00:15:16,708
[MANDALAY]
Hey, Kota!

345
00:15:16,791 --> 00:15:18,791
Can you bring me
those vegetables?

346
00:15:29,625 --> 00:15:32,125
[MINETA] The food and stuff
is fine, but to be honest,

347
00:15:32,208 --> 00:15:34,083
I'm hungry for somethin' else.

348
00:15:34,166 --> 00:15:35,833
Just one little wall.

349
00:15:35,916 --> 00:15:37,458
A few pieces of wood.

350
00:15:37,541 --> 00:15:39,833
And heaven's waiting
on the other side.

351
00:15:39,916 --> 00:15:44,333
A bath full of boobs and babes
ready to be seen by yours truly.

352
00:15:44,416 --> 00:15:45,750
[KAMINARI sighs]

353
00:15:45,833 --> 00:15:48,125
Are you over there talking
to yourself again, Mineta?

354
00:15:48,208 --> 00:15:49,833
[ASHIDO]
This feels amazing!

355
00:15:49,916 --> 00:15:52,125
[JIRO] I'm so glad they've
got a hot springs here!

356
00:15:52,208 --> 00:15:55,083
Bathe, my angels.

357
00:15:55,166 --> 00:15:57,291
How stupid of them not
to stagger the times

358
00:15:57,375 --> 00:16:00,583
that we'd be naked
next to each other.

359
00:16:00,666 --> 00:16:03,125
I hope they never learn
from their mistakes.

360
00:16:03,208 --> 00:16:04,750
It's too much for him.

361
00:16:04,833 --> 00:16:07,000
You're to stop this
at once, Mineta.

362
00:16:07,083 --> 00:16:08,375
What you're doing is demeaning.

363
00:16:08,458 --> 00:16:10,208
For both the girls and yourself.

364
00:16:10,291 --> 00:16:12,166
It's shameful behavior!

365
00:16:13,625 --> 00:16:16,583
Now I know why
I have this Quirk.

366
00:16:16,666 --> 00:16:19,875
[MINETA] It's because walls
are meant to be climbed.

367
00:16:19,958 --> 00:16:23,750
I'm coming for you,
ladies, Plus Ultra!

368
00:16:23,833 --> 00:16:25,125
All that Quirk training.

369
00:16:25,208 --> 00:16:27,000
All the times I almost died.

370
00:16:27,083 --> 00:16:31,250
It was to prepare for
this shining momen--!

371
00:16:31,333 --> 00:16:33,000
[KOTA]
Before you become a hero,

372
00:16:33,083 --> 00:16:36,166
you should learn
how to be a good human.

373
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:38,708
I'll get you for this!

374
00:16:38,791 --> 00:16:40,791

--[KOTA] Hmph.

376
00:16:42,541 --> 00:16:45,000
[TSUYU] Mineta really is
the worst, isn't he?

377
00:16:45,083 --> 00:16:47,250
[ASHIDO]
Thanks so much, Kota, babe!

378
00:16:47,333 --> 00:16:50,000
We owe you one!

[IZUKU]
Look out!

383
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,041
[MANDALAY]
The rush from the fall

384
00:17:01,125 --> 00:17:04,708
likely caused him
to faint. Thank you.

385
00:17:04,791 --> 00:17:07,750
Eraser warned me one of you
boys was a little girl crazy,

386
00:17:07,833 --> 00:17:10,666
so I stationed Kota
up there to keep watch.

387
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:13,916
I suppose that's the danger
of teaching kids your age.

388
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,791
Well, anyway. I'm just
glad he's all right.

389
00:17:16,875 --> 00:17:19,875
You must've moved
pretty fast to catch him.

390
00:17:19,958 --> 00:17:21,500
[KOTA]
The last thing I want is to hang

391
00:17:21,583 --> 00:17:24,125
with some wannabe heroes.

392
00:17:27,416 --> 00:17:31,791
[IZUKU] Um. He doesn't like
heroes very much, does he?

393
00:17:31,875 --> 00:17:33,625
I admit, that's weird to me.

394
00:17:33,708 --> 00:17:36,041
Most everyone I know
wants to be one.

395
00:17:36,125 --> 00:17:38,125
It's... my dream.

396
00:17:38,208 --> 00:17:40,958
So, it's just wild to
think that a kid his age

397
00:17:41,041 --> 00:17:44,708
is against heroes.
Hates them, even.

398
00:17:44,791 --> 00:17:47,875
How observant. Of course,
he isn't alone.

399
00:17:47,958 --> 00:17:52,458
There are many in our society
who don't approve of us.

400
00:17:52,541 --> 00:17:54,625
If he'd had a normal childhood,

401
00:17:54,708 --> 00:17:57,833
maybe he would've admired heroes
like you did growing up.

402
00:17:57,916 --> 00:17:59,958
[gasps] What happened?

403
00:18:00,041 --> 00:18:02,250
[PIXIE-BOB]
It was Mandalay's cousins.

404
00:18:02,333 --> 00:18:06,583
Kota's parents, that is.
They were heroes, too.

405
00:18:06,666 --> 00:18:08,250
But they were murdered.

406
00:18:08,333 --> 00:18:09,791
[gasps]

407
00:18:09,875 --> 00:18:12,291
It was a villain.
Two years back.

408
00:18:12,375 --> 00:18:14,958
Kota was still so small.

409
00:18:15,041 --> 00:18:17,625
They were killed while
protecting citizens.

410
00:18:17,708 --> 00:18:21,333
Perhaps the most respectable
way for any hero to die.

411
00:18:21,416 --> 00:18:23,166
But...

412
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:26,416
[KOTA]
Papa. Mama.

413
00:18:27,791 --> 00:18:30,125
[MANDALAY] How do you even
begin to explain to a child

414
00:18:30,208 --> 00:18:33,583
that his parents died
honorable deaths?

415
00:18:33,666 --> 00:18:37,208
They were his entire
world. Everything.

416
00:18:37,291 --> 00:18:41,458
But to him, his parents
had left him behind.

417
00:18:41,541 --> 00:18:43,625
And all the while,
they were being praised.

418
00:18:43,708 --> 00:18:47,916
Because... their sacrefice
was such a noble one.

419
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,833
Honestly, he doesn't
seem to like us

420
00:18:49,916 --> 00:18:53,750
that much either. We're
heroes, like they were.

421
00:18:53,833 --> 00:18:55,458
I'm sure he feels like
he's stuck here

422
00:18:55,541 --> 00:18:57,791
because he has
nowhere else to go.

423
00:18:57,875 --> 00:19:01,250
Heroes just don't make
any sense to Kota.

424
00:19:01,333 --> 00:19:03,708
After all, if his parents
hadn't been heroes,

425
00:19:03,791 --> 00:19:05,958
they would still be here.

426
00:19:06,041 --> 00:19:07,333
[SHIGARAKI]
He's why these morons

427
00:19:07,416 --> 00:19:09,583
are able to smile thoughtlessly!

428
00:19:09,666 --> 00:19:14,000
Because that garbage pro
is smiling thoughtlessly, too!

429
00:19:14,083 --> 00:19:16,208
[IZUKU] I'd heard so many
different people talking about

430
00:19:16,291 --> 00:19:18,375
heroes over the last few months.

431
00:19:18,458 --> 00:19:21,375
Had listened to so many
different viewpoints.

432
00:19:21,458 --> 00:19:24,583
It would be irresponsible
to shrug them off.

433
00:19:24,666 --> 00:19:27,750
And yet, in that moment,
I had no reply.

435
00:19:37,041 --> 00:19:38,708
[AIZAWA]
Good morning, class.

436
00:19:38,791 --> 00:19:40,208
Today, we begin a training camp

437
00:19:40,291 --> 00:19:42,583
that will increase
your strength.

438
00:19:42,666 --> 00:19:45,000
Our goal is to increase
your skills exponentially,

439
00:19:45,083 --> 00:19:47,916
so that each of you earns
a provisional license.

440
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,666
This will allow you
to face the dangers

441
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:52,125
that continue to fester
in the darkness.

442
00:19:52,208 --> 00:19:56,458
Proceed carefully.
Look alive, Bakugo.

443
00:19:56,541 --> 00:19:58,333
Try throwing that for me.

444
00:19:58,416 --> 00:20:01,000
Yeah, sure. Like in
the fitness test.

445
00:20:01,083 --> 00:20:02,583
[AIZAWA]
That's right.

446
00:20:02,666 --> 00:20:06,083
When you first started school,
your record was 705.2 meters.

447
00:20:06,166 --> 00:20:07,458
Let's see if you've improved.

448

[ASHIDO] Oh, I get it!
We're checking our progress.

449
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:12,458
[SERO] A lot's happened to
us the last three months.

450
00:20:12,541 --> 00:20:14,625
Maybe he can throw it
a whole mile now!

451
00:20:14,708 --> 00:20:17,541
[KIRISHIMA]
C'mon, get it, Bakugo!

452
00:20:17,625 --> 00:20:21,166
I've got this. No one blink.

453
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:23,541

[AIZAWA]
That was 709.6 meters.

[KATSUKI grunts]

457
00:20:36,958 --> 00:20:40,041
[SERO]
That's it? Kinda disappointing.

458
00:20:42,791 --> 00:20:45,000
[AIZAWA] You've had
a single semester at UA,

459
00:20:45,083 --> 00:20:46,625
and due to your
various experiences,

460
00:20:46,708 --> 00:20:48,875
all of you have
definitely improved.

461
00:20:48,958 --> 00:20:50,416
But those improvements
have mostly been

462
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:53,291
limited to mental prowess
and technical skill.

463
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:56,666
With a slight increase in
stamina thrown in along the way.

464
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:59,333
Your Quirks really haven't
grown that much stronger.

465
00:20:59,416 --> 00:21:01,000
Not on a fundamental level.

[AIZAWA] This'll be so hard,
you'll feel like you're dying.

00:22:52,708 --> 00:22:55,500
so I'm guessing there's
enough for everyone.

474
00:22:55,583 --> 00:22:58,541
[MUSCULAR]
C'mon. I'm ready.

475
00:22:58,625 --> 00:23:00,583
Let's hurry up and do this.

476
00:23:00,666 --> 00:23:02,458
[MUSTARD]
It's still too early.

477
00:23:02,541 --> 00:23:03,916
Besides, don't forget,

478
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,083
he said we shouldn't
do anything flashy.

479
00:23:06,166 --> 00:23:07,500
[DABI]
Yeah.

480
00:23:07,583 --> 00:23:10,500
He acted like a spoiled
little brat when we first met.

481
00:23:10,583 --> 00:23:15,083
But suddenly, he's begun
to take charge.

482
00:23:15,166 --> 00:23:17,708
This is gonna be nothing
more than a warning shot.

483
00:23:17,791 --> 00:23:19,500
We'll pull those
false heroes down

484
00:23:19,583 --> 00:23:22,333
from their shining pedestals.

485
00:23:22,416 --> 00:23:23,750
And in doing so, we'll create

486
00:23:23,833 --> 00:23:26,416
a bright new future
for this world.

487
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:30,541
[IZUKU]
Here's the preview!

488
00:23:30,625 --> 00:23:32,791
It turns out that developing
our individual Quirks

489
00:23:32,875 --> 00:23:35,208
is this summer training
camp's main focus.

490
00:23:35,291 --> 00:23:37,666
To do that, we've got to
push ourselves to the limit.

491
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:40,458
It's the only way we can
hope to become pros!

492
00:23:40,541 --> 00:23:42,375
But Kota still scoffs at us.

493
00:23:42,458 --> 00:23:44,000
Even though he's part
of Mandalay's family,

494
00:23:44,083 --> 00:23:45,708
he doesn't like heroes.

495
00:23:45,791 --> 00:23:49,208
I wonder what happened in his
past to make him feel that way.

496
00:23:49,291 --> 00:23:50,958
Next time: "Kota."

497
00:23:51,041 --> 00:23:53,416
I can't wait to find out what
the Pussycats' test of courage

498
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:55,208
has in store for us!

499
00:23:55,291 --> 00:23:58,416
[IZUKU]
Go beyond! Plus Ultra!
