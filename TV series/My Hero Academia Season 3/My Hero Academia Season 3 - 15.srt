[IZUKU]
Welcome to UA High,

2
00:00:12,125 --> 00:00:13,625
the prestigious school
that's turned out

3
00:00:13,708 --> 00:00:16,125
some of the world's
greatest heroes.

4
00:00:16,208 --> 00:00:18,250
I'm running toward my
dream in these halls.

5
00:00:18,333 --> 00:00:19,750
Learning to overcome obstacles

6
00:00:19,833 --> 00:00:22,875
and save people with
a smile on my face.

7
00:00:22,958 --> 00:00:25,958
That's how I'll become
the greatest hero in the world!

8
00:01:59,208 --> 00:02:01,583
[HATSUME] Leg-centric
techniques? Ingenious!

9
00:02:01,666 --> 00:02:04,708
If your arms are unstable,
then start kicking.

10
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:05,750
Very clever.

11
00:02:05,833 --> 00:02:07,083
I've got some great ideas.

12
00:02:07,166 --> 00:02:08,833
Just give me a few minutes
and I'll whip up some

13
00:02:08,916 --> 00:02:10,916
super-cute leg babies
you'll totally die for!

14
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,250
[IZUKU]
Um, actually, the thing is...

15
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:15,500
I don't really wanna change
the design of my costume

16
00:02:15,583 --> 00:02:16,750
very much if I can help it.

17
00:02:16,833 --> 00:02:18,625
A good designer meets
the reckless, ignorant,

18
00:02:18,708 --> 00:02:20,625
and ill-advised
demands of the client.

19
00:02:20,708 --> 00:02:21,708
How 'bout it, sir?

20
00:02:21,791 --> 00:02:22,833
If my work is good enough,

21
00:02:22,916 --> 00:02:24,750
will you please add
it to his costume?

22
00:02:24,833 --> 00:02:26,000
[POWER LOADER]
If it's safe, sure.

23
00:02:26,083 --> 00:02:28,250
[IZUKU] So, they're not
even going to ask me.

24
00:02:28,333 --> 00:02:29,416
Oh, by the way.

25
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:31,041
If your legs are your
new selling point,

26
00:02:31,125 --> 00:02:33,791
then, you're probably going to
be more of a speed-type hero

27
00:02:33,875 --> 00:02:34,916
rather than the power-type

28
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,708
you've been marketing
yourself as.

29
00:02:36,791 --> 00:02:38,291
[IZUKU]
That's true.

30
00:02:38,375 --> 00:02:40,166
[HATSUME] With his stature and
weight, Iida here is basically

31
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:42,958
an armored tank equipped
with an F1 engine.

32
00:02:43,041 --> 00:02:44,291
It's gonna be hard to impress

33
00:02:44,375 --> 00:02:45,958
if you're in the
same ring as him.

34
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:47,166
Wait a second!

35
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:49,125
I've got a power-up move
called Full Cowling

36
00:02:49,208 --> 00:02:50,375
I'm getting good at.

37
00:02:50,458 --> 00:02:52,416
It lets me increase my
whole body's strength.

38
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:55,916
[HATSUME] Oh, in that case,
I know just what to do.

39
00:03:01,166 --> 00:03:03,000
[KATSUKI]
A new move.

40
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:05,500
[KATSUKI]
AP Shot!

41
00:03:07,333 --> 00:03:10,125
[KATSUKI]
Ha, ha! I did it!

42
00:03:13,083 --> 00:03:14,625
Hey! Watch out!

43
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:20,083
[IZUKU] I got the idea
for Full Cowling

44
00:03:20,166 --> 00:03:22,083
from Gran Torino and Kacchan.

45
00:03:22,166 --> 00:03:23,791
It requires quick,
small movements

46
00:03:23,875 --> 00:03:26,583
combined with
precise maneuvering.

47
00:03:26,666 --> 00:03:28,083
In order to keep that up,

48
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:31,333
I need equipment that
maximizes my Quirk.

49
00:03:31,416 --> 00:03:33,041
Arm-supporting braces

50
00:03:33,125 --> 00:03:35,791
and iron soles that can
act like cleats or armor.

51
00:03:38,583 --> 00:03:40,666
[IZUKU]
Smash!

52
00:03:46,375 --> 00:03:48,375
[IZUKU]
Hatsume did a great job.

53
00:03:48,458 --> 00:03:50,750
I call this new,
supercharged look,

54
00:03:50,833 --> 00:03:52,583
Costume Gamma!

55
00:03:57,375 --> 00:03:58,750
You okay, All Might?

56
00:03:58,833 --> 00:03:59,958
That was close.

57
00:04:00,041 --> 00:04:01,208
Yeah!

58
00:04:01,291 --> 00:04:02,708
[AIZAWA]
Hm.

59
00:04:02,791 --> 00:04:04,333
[KAMINARI]
Dude, Midoriya, what was that?

60
00:04:04,416 --> 00:04:06,000
You swooped in and
wasted that rock.

61
00:04:06,083 --> 00:04:08,250
I always thought you
were more of a puncher.

62
00:04:08,333 --> 00:04:10,625
I am. Or, I was.

63
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:12,166
It's these new soles.

64
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:14,750
Hatsume suggested them and I
think they'll really up my game.

65
00:04:14,833 --> 00:04:17,000
Plus, Iida's been showing me
how to use my body better,

66
00:04:17,083 --> 00:04:19,000
so my fighting
style has changed.

67
00:04:19,083 --> 00:04:21,458
I've only just figured out
what direction to go in.

68
00:04:21,541 --> 00:04:22,916
I still have a lot
of work to do.

69
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,250
Nothing I'd call
an ultimate move yet.

70
00:04:25,333 --> 00:04:26,958
[ALL MIGHT]
I dunno.

71
00:04:27,041 --> 00:04:28,250
Based on that kick,
I'd say you're

72
00:04:28,333 --> 00:04:29,916
further along than you think.

73
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,500
So, you should be
ready for this test.

74
00:04:33,958 --> 00:04:35,125
Hey, All Might.

75
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:37,416
It's dangerous in here,
you should be careful.

76
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,666
Yeah, I know.

77
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:42,041
Sorry for the scare,
Young Bakugo.

78
00:04:47,125 --> 00:04:49,458
[KATSUKI]
You watch yourself, All Might!

79
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,583
[ALL MIGHT]
"Watch yourself," huh?

80
00:04:53,666 --> 00:04:57,208
I guess it only makes sense.

81
00:04:57,291 --> 00:04:59,625
To everyone else,
I'm a weakling now.

82
00:04:59,708 --> 00:05:01,958
Someone who needs
to be protected.

83
00:05:02,041 --> 00:05:04,208
You guys made improvements
to your costumes, too?

84
00:05:04,291 --> 00:05:06,958
Yeah! I see you've noticed
we look pretty awesome.

85
00:05:07,041 --> 00:05:10,041
You're not the only one here
with a brand-new style.

86
00:05:10,125 --> 00:05:12,375
We've all been making
changes here and there.

87
00:05:12,458 --> 00:05:14,458
Now's the time
to upgrade, right?

88
00:05:14,541 --> 00:05:15,708
Just wait.

89
00:05:15,791 --> 00:05:18,000
My new special gear is
gonna blow your mind.

90
00:05:18,083 --> 00:05:19,791
It's a serious power boost.

91
00:05:19,875 --> 00:05:22,416
Wanna see? C'mon.
It's totally amazing!

92
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,625
[VLAD KING]
That's enough, Class A.

93
00:05:24,708 --> 00:05:25,958
Class B is scheduled to use

94
00:05:26,041 --> 00:05:28,000
this training room
every afternoon.

95
00:05:28,083 --> 00:05:29,041
Class B?

96
00:05:29,125 --> 00:05:31,208
Man. Crap timing.

97
00:05:31,291 --> 00:05:34,041
Eraser, get your kids
out of our way.

98
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:35,708
You're not trying
to kick us out early

99
00:05:35,791 --> 00:05:38,833
when we have ten whole
minutes left, are you?

100
00:05:38,916 --> 00:05:40,166
[MONOMA]
Hey, did ya hear?

101
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:42,958
The license exam has
a 50 percent pass rate.

102
00:05:43,041 --> 00:05:45,500
That means your entire
class might fail.

103
00:05:45,583 --> 00:05:47,875
[IZUKU] I always forget
how much this guy hates us.

104
00:05:47,958 --> 00:05:49,208
--[MONOMA laughs]
--Wait.

--[MONOMA laughs]
--Is that Monoma's hero costume?

106
00:05:50,958 --> 00:05:52,416
[KENDO]
Well, since his Quirk is Copy,

107
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:56,125
he said he didn't need anything
too eccentric. Just that.

108
00:05:56,208 --> 00:05:58,125
[KAMINARI]
This is him toned down?

109
00:05:58,208 --> 00:06:00,791
Unfortunately, his
observations are correct.

110
00:06:00,875 --> 00:06:04,375
If we're taking the same exam,
then we'll crush each other.

111
00:06:04,458 --> 00:06:06,541
That's the hand
fate has dealt us.

112
00:06:06,625 --> 00:06:08,916
And why we won't be
in the same location.

113
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,708
Our classes applied
to different spots.

114
00:06:10,791 --> 00:06:12,208
Ha!

115
00:06:12,291 --> 00:06:13,708
There are two exam days.

116
00:06:13,791 --> 00:06:15,458
In June and in September.

117
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:18,333
And the tests are held
in three different places.

118
00:06:18,416 --> 00:06:20,916
We don't want students from
the same place fighting.

119
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,416
We split you up.

120
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:25,750
Each school has at most one
class at a single location.

121
00:06:25,833 --> 00:06:27,375
Whew.

122
00:06:27,458 --> 00:06:30,541
How sad we won't be able
to face each other directly.

123
00:06:30,625 --> 00:06:32,166
Man. This guy's nuts.

124
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:35,375
Yeah, I think he's officially
gone off the deep end.

125
00:06:35,458 --> 00:06:36,875
All those other schools.

126
00:06:36,958 --> 00:06:38,958
Huh. Interesting.

127
00:06:39,041 --> 00:06:40,750
I didn't know that was the case.

128
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:43,041
So we'll be facing kids
from other places.

129
00:06:43,125 --> 00:06:44,666
Yeah. And on top of that,

130
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:47,708
we're taking the test earlier
than most other students.

131
00:06:47,791 --> 00:06:48,916
[AIZAWA]
That's true.

132
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,750
Very few first years
in the country

133
00:06:50,833 --> 00:06:52,708
try for a provisional license.

134
00:06:52,791 --> 00:06:55,375
In other words, the test
will be made up of students

135
00:06:55,458 --> 00:06:57,041
who've trained longer than you,

136
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:59,000
and with Quirks
you don't know about.

137
00:06:59,083 --> 00:07:00,750
Ones that are powerful.

138
00:07:00,833 --> 00:07:03,125
The actual content of
the exam is a mystery,

139
00:07:03,208 --> 00:07:05,708
but you can expect that you're
going to have a rough time.

140
00:07:05,791 --> 00:07:07,750
Try not to get
hung up about that,

141
00:07:07,833 --> 00:07:09,541
but keep it in mind.

[ASHIDO groans]
Does it have to be this hard?

144
00:07:16,458 --> 00:07:18,958
[HAGAKURE] Well it's not called
intensive training for nothing.

145
00:07:19,041 --> 00:07:20,958
That's true. But it's
strange to think

146
00:07:21,041 --> 00:07:23,000
there's only a week
left before the exam.

147

[HAGAKURE] Yao-momo, how's
your ultimate move coming?

148
00:07:26,333 --> 00:07:28,250
There's something
I really wanna do,

149
00:07:28,333 --> 00:07:30,375
but my body just
isn't ready yet.

150
00:07:30,458 --> 00:07:31,875
I need time to develop my Quirk

and improve my
general endurance.

152

[HAGAKURE]
How 'bout you, Tsu?

even more froglike than before.

00:07:45,916 --> 00:07:47,208
You seem a little tense.

00:07:47,291 --> 00:07:49,875
No, it's nothing.
Everything's going awesome.

161
00:07:49,958 --> 00:07:51,750
I'm just getting started.

[ASHIDO, JIRO]
Uh...

163
00:07:53,083 --> 00:07:56,500
[OCHACO] At least,
that's how I'd usually be.

164
00:07:56,583 --> 00:07:58,000
The thing is,

165
00:07:58,083 --> 00:08:00,708
recently my heart's been all
stirred up about something.

166
00:08:00,791 --> 00:08:02,416
It's love!

167
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:05,208
What did you say?
Glove? Shove? Dove?

168
00:08:05,291 --> 00:08:06,208
Never even seen one--
what's that?

169
00:08:06,291 --> 00:08:08,166
So, who is it?
Midoriya or Iida?

170
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:10,000
You're always hanging out
with those two boys.

00:08:10,083 --> 00:08:11,416
[OCHACO]
You've got it all wrong.

172
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:12,791
That's not it, I swear!

173
00:08:12,875 --> 00:08:13,958
[ASHIDO]
She's floating.

174
00:08:14,041 --> 00:08:15,708
[HAGAKURE]
Which one? Or someone else?

175
00:08:15,791 --> 00:08:16,750
Come on, spill!

176
00:08:16,833 --> 00:08:18,083
Yeah, out with it.

177
00:08:18,166 --> 00:08:20,250
You know we're not gonna
give up until we know.

I swear, it's no one!

179

Besides, it's not like I even
know anything about dating.

180
00:08:25,083 --> 00:08:27,583
It's not good to force
an investigation.

181
00:08:27,666 --> 00:08:30,291
She's right. More
importantly, it's late.

182
00:08:30,375 --> 00:08:31,625
We should call it a night.

183
00:08:31,708 --> 00:08:34,791
Ugh! No! I wanna
hear everything!

184
00:08:34,875 --> 00:08:36,625
You can't just spring
a hint of romance on us

185
00:08:36,708 --> 00:08:38,333
and expect me to go to sleep!

186
00:08:38,416 --> 00:08:39,958
What romance?

187
00:08:40,041 --> 00:08:41,041

[IZUKU]
That's not it.

190
00:08:53,916 --> 00:08:56,625
Iida looked different.
Bent his back, I think.

191
00:08:56,708 --> 00:08:57,916
He's so flexible.

192
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,375
I can see his shape
in my head right now.

193
00:09:00,458 --> 00:09:04,041
So in order to bring this up
to the "ultimate move level"...

00:09:04,125 --> 00:09:06,375
[OCHACO]
That's not it.

[IZUKU] Before we even knew it,
the day of the exam was here.

00:09:16,916 --> 00:09:19,541
Ugh... I'm getting
kind of nervous.

197
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:21,500
I wonder what they're
gonna make us do.

get my license?

Don't ask if you can.
Say you will.

Right. Sure. I've so got this!

202
00:09:31,291 --> 00:09:32,458
[AIZAWA]
If you can pass this test

203
00:09:32,541 --> 00:09:34,250
and get your
provisional licenses,

204
00:09:34,333 --> 00:09:36,541
then you novice eggs
will hatch into chicks.

205
00:09:36,625 --> 00:09:39,416
You'll be semi-pros.

I expect your best.

All right. I can't wait
to be a heroic chicken.

to barge into other people's

It's him.

through recommendations.

But for some unknown reason,

he turned down his
acceptance to UA

243

else confused here?

This guy says that
he loves our school,

but, he turned down his chance
to enroll when it was offered?

Yeah. What a weirdo.

She forces people
around her to laugh,

316
00:13:36,875 --> 00:13:39,375
You were so cool at
the sports festival.

317
00:13:39,458 --> 00:13:41,916
--[TODOROKI] Uhh...
--Seriously? Stop fangirling.

318
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,083
I'd be happy to sign
somethin' for ya.

319
00:13:44,166 --> 00:13:47,333
Hey. Get your costumes
and head to orientation.

320
00:13:47,416 --> 00:13:49,083
There's no time to waste.

321
00:13:49,166 --> 00:13:50,625
[STUDENTS]
Yes, sir!

322
00:13:50,708 --> 00:13:53,541
It's weird. I always forget
we're famous to other schools.

323
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:55,250
Oh, yeah, we're
basically celebrities

324
00:13:55,333 --> 00:13:57,583
when it comes to
hero course students.

325
00:13:57,666 --> 00:13:58,833
No pictures, please!

326
00:13:58,916 --> 00:13:59,958
Wait, hold on.

327
00:14:00,041 --> 00:14:02,291
Did you not warn
your kids, Eraser?

328
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:12,250
Look at this crowd.

329
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:14,000
There're so many.

330
00:14:14,083 --> 00:14:15,625
[MERA groans]

331
00:14:15,708 --> 00:14:19,375
Okay then. Let's do
this exam thing.

332
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:24,125
I'm from, uh, the Heroes
Public Safety Commission.

333
00:14:24,208 --> 00:14:25,791
Name's Mera.

334
00:14:25,875 --> 00:14:29,208
My Circadian Rhythm
is so screwed up.

335
00:14:29,291 --> 00:14:30,875
Ah, man.

336
00:14:30,958 --> 00:14:34,250
I've been swamped lately and
I haven't gotten much rest.

337
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:38,041
We're too short staffed.
I'm so tired.

338
00:14:38,125 --> 00:14:42,083
With that confession,
I'll now begin orientation.

339
00:14:42,166 --> 00:14:44,291
[IZUKU] Maybe someone should
give this guy a break.

340
00:14:44,375 --> 00:14:46,125
Before he passes out.

341
00:14:46,208 --> 00:14:49,208
[MERA] So, about the content
of this license thing.

342
00:14:49,291 --> 00:14:52,833
Basically, 1,540
examinees compete

343
00:14:52,916 --> 00:14:54,750
in a free-for-all exercise

344
00:14:54,833 --> 00:14:57,000
or whatever we're
calling it this year.

345
00:14:57,083 --> 00:14:59,916
Seriously? That's not
a lot of info.

346
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,166
See, we've got a lot
of pros around,

347
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:07,291
and since Stain was arrested,
many people've expressed doubts

348
00:15:07,375 --> 00:15:10,958
about the status of
heroes in society.

349
00:15:11,041 --> 00:15:13,458
[IZUKU] He must be talking
about Stain's convictions.

350
00:15:13,541 --> 00:15:16,375
The idea that most pros aren't
worthy of the name "hero."

351
00:15:16,458 --> 00:15:19,541
That the only things they're
after are fame and fortune.

352
00:15:19,625 --> 00:15:22,375
The Hero Killer is still
affecting our world.

353
00:15:22,458 --> 00:15:27,166
But, when you really think about
it, getting paid makes sense.

354
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:30,166
If you're going to risk
your life to save someone,

355
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:33,166
why shouldn't you ask
for a reward, huh?

356
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:35,291
That's just the way
the world works.

357
00:15:35,375 --> 00:15:37,541
God, I could use a coffee.

358
00:15:37,625 --> 00:15:40,125
Anyway, whether they're
in it for compensation

359
00:15:40,208 --> 00:15:41,625
or out of a sense of duty,

360
00:15:41,708 --> 00:15:44,416
we've got too many heroes
working together in the streets

361
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:47,791
these days to keep
villains at bay.

362
00:15:47,875 --> 00:15:50,583
Honestly, the time between
when an incident begins

363
00:15:50,666 --> 00:15:54,000
and when it's resolved
is ridiculously short.

364
00:15:54,083 --> 00:15:55,625
You are all here
trying to receive

365
00:15:55,708 --> 00:15:58,500
your provisional licenses,
so you'll be swept up

366
00:15:58,583 --> 00:16:01,833
in this tiresome mess
yourselves pretty soon.

367
00:16:01,916 --> 00:16:04,250
Those of you who
don't have the speed,

368
00:16:04,333 --> 00:16:06,750
frankly, just won't cut it.

369
00:16:06,833 --> 00:16:09,958
Which is why that's what
you'll be tested on.

370
00:16:10,041 --> 00:16:12,458
The first 100 students
to fulfill the requirements

371
00:16:12,541 --> 00:16:13,833
will pass today.

372
00:16:13,916 --> 00:16:17,125
There are over 1,500 people
taking this test.

373
00:16:17,208 --> 00:16:19,958
I thought they said that about
half of us would be passing.

374
00:16:20,041 --> 00:16:21,541
This means...

375
00:16:21,625 --> 00:16:23,958
...it's actually less than one
percent who'll get a license.

376
00:16:24,041 --> 00:16:26,750
Oh, man, I'm getting
way more nervous.

377
00:16:26,833 --> 00:16:29,333
Well, the world can
be pretty crappy.

378
00:16:29,416 --> 00:16:33,041
I suppose I should say
something about luck.

379
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:36,791
So, anyway, here
are the basic rules.

380
00:16:36,875 --> 00:16:39,166
The examinee will put
three of these targets

381
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:40,916
on his or her body.

382
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,791
They can go anywhere you want as
long as it's an exposed area.

383
00:16:44,875 --> 00:16:48,041
So no soles of
the feet or armpits.

384
00:16:48,125 --> 00:16:51,916
Each of you will also
have six of these balls.

385
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,916
The targets are
programmed to light up

386
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,500
whenever they've been
touched by the balls.

387
00:16:56,583 --> 00:16:59,875
If all three targets
light up, you're out.

388
00:16:59,958 --> 00:17:02,416
Oh, and the person who
lights up your third target

389
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:05,125
will get credit for your defeat.

390
00:17:05,208 --> 00:17:08,416
You get through this round
by taking down two people.

391
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:10,625
Got it? Good.

392
00:17:10,708 --> 00:17:12,708
[IZUKU] It's similar
to the entrance exam.

393
00:17:12,791 --> 00:17:16,416
But going against people will
be a lot harder than robots.

394
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:19,000
We're given exactly enough
balls for us to pass.

395
00:17:19,083 --> 00:17:20,416
Although, I guess
you could always try

396
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:22,208
to steal the third
target from someone else

397
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:24,333
after they've
hit the first two.

398
00:17:24,416 --> 00:17:27,458
So it's even harsher
than the entrance test.

399
00:17:27,541 --> 00:17:28,958
[MERA]
What else?

400
00:17:29,041 --> 00:17:32,166
Uh, I guess we'll start passing
out the targets and balls.

401
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:36,041
Then, you'll have a few minutes
to get situated after we open.

402
00:17:36,125 --> 00:17:36,875
"Open"?

403
00:17:36,958 --> 00:17:41,916
[rumbling]

404
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:44,541
[IZUKU gasps]

405
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,166
[MERA] I'm sure each of you
have different terrains

406
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:57,333
that you like or want to avoid.

407
00:17:57,416 --> 00:18:00,000
Use your Quirks well
and do your best.

408
00:18:00,083 --> 00:18:01,791
Or not. Whatever.

409
00:18:01,875 --> 00:18:04,000
[IZUKU]
This is so unnecessary.

410
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:07,958
Yes, I know, it makes for
a great reveal, doesn't it?

411
00:18:08,041 --> 00:18:10,083
And for what?

412
00:18:10,166 --> 00:18:12,625
So much sleep lost for this.

413
00:18:12,708 --> 00:18:14,958
Hopefully some of
these kids are fast

414
00:18:15,041 --> 00:18:16,916
and we can get this over with.

415
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,208
Until then, I'm gonna
rest my eyes.

416
00:18:19,291 --> 00:18:22,083
[MS. JOKE]
Eraser, your fly is down!

417
00:18:22,166 --> 00:18:24,041
[AIZAWA] Why is it that
I can't find a moment

418
00:18:24,125 --> 00:18:26,041
of peace and quiet in my life?

419
00:18:26,125 --> 00:18:28,416
I can't believe you
still have 20 students!

420
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:31,666
It's unusual for you not
to have expelled someone.

421
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:34,041
You must actually like
your class this time.

422
00:18:34,125 --> 00:18:35,416
Not really.

423
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:38,583
[laughs] Don't be embarrassed.
That's so like you!

424
00:18:38,666 --> 00:18:39,625
--Please date me.
--Shut up.

425
00:18:39,708 --> 00:18:41,958
[laughs]

426
00:18:42,041 --> 00:18:45,166
But really. You know what's
about to happen down there.

427
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:48,333
And yet, you didn't mention
a thing to your class.

428
00:18:51,375 --> 00:18:53,125
[IZUKU] If the first
people to finish win,

429
00:18:53,208 --> 00:18:55,541
then no one will go
after their classmates.

430
00:18:55,625 --> 00:18:57,291
The best way to win is
to team up with people

431
00:18:57,375 --> 00:18:59,125
whose powers you already know.

432
00:18:59,208 --> 00:19:00,458
Everyone!

433
00:19:00,541 --> 00:19:02,541
Stay close together,
we'll fight them as a group.

--[OCHACO] Mm.
--[TENYA] Got it.

436

[TODOROKI]
I'm going on my own, too.

440
00:19:12,916 --> 00:19:14,791
It's hard for me to
use my power safely

441
00:19:14,875 --> 00:19:16,041
when a big group's around.

Midoriya, there's
no time. Let's go!

444
00:19:19,375 --> 00:19:20,916
Uh--

445
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,125
Every year, the
test is different.

446
00:19:23,208 --> 00:19:24,875
But one thing's always the same.

447
00:19:24,958 --> 00:19:28,000
It's kind of like a tradition
during the licensing exam.

448
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:29,458
I don't think it's
a good idea for them

449
00:19:29,541 --> 00:19:30,708
to go off on their own, though.

450
00:19:30,791 --> 00:19:31,666
How come?

451
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:32,916
Think about it.

452
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,500
Everyone already knows
what powers we have.

453
00:19:35,583 --> 00:19:37,000
They did research?

454
00:19:37,083 --> 00:19:39,375
[TENYA]
I see. The sports festival!

455
00:19:39,458 --> 00:19:41,916
Most of the students who
compete in the provisional exam

456
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,666
have pretty equal footing.

457
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:45,500
Except for one school.

458
00:19:45,583 --> 00:19:48,500
UA comes in at a
severe disadvantage.

459
00:19:48,583 --> 00:19:50,208
Because the top school's
sports festival

460
00:19:50,291 --> 00:19:52,125
is broadcast across the country,

461
00:19:52,208 --> 00:19:54,375
showing off not just
your students' Quirks,

462
00:19:54,458 --> 00:19:58,375
but their weaknesses
and fighting styles, too.

463
00:19:58,458 --> 00:20:01,125
Kinda funny, isn't it?

464
00:20:01,208 --> 00:20:02,875
[IZUKU] The other schools
have probably figured out

465
00:20:02,958 --> 00:20:05,000
the same way to win that I have.

466
00:20:05,083 --> 00:20:08,000
This is going to end up being
a battle between schools.

467
00:20:08,083 --> 00:20:09,541
With that in mind,

468
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:11,875
first, it's likely they'll gang
up against Quirks they know.

469
00:20:11,958 --> 00:20:12,875
Does that mean?

470
00:20:12,958 --> 00:20:13,833
Don't tell me.

471
00:20:13,916 --> 00:20:15,125
[beep]

472
00:20:15,208 --> 00:20:17,833
[ANNOUNCER 53A]
The first test will now begin.

473
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:19,375
If you like your
class this year,

474
00:20:19,458 --> 00:20:22,333
then you should have warned
your students about all this.

475
00:20:22,416 --> 00:20:24,916
We've seen it time and
time again in this exam.

476
00:20:27,375 --> 00:20:30,208
[MS. JOKE]
UA is immediately crushed.

477
00:20:31,958 --> 00:20:32,833
I knew it.

478
00:20:32,916 --> 00:20:35,000
[SHINDO]
I saw you on TV.

479
00:20:35,083 --> 00:20:38,083
That power of yours
also destroys your body.

480
00:20:38,166 --> 00:20:41,458
Well, I can't say I'm above
taking advantage of that!

481
00:20:43,125 --> 00:20:44,291
Based on that kick,

482
00:20:44,375 --> 00:20:45,791
I'd say you're further
along than you think.

483
00:20:45,875 --> 00:20:48,875
So, you should be
ready for this test.

484
00:20:48,958 --> 00:20:50,458
[IZUKU]
One for All.

485
00:20:50,541 --> 00:20:52,166
Full Cowling!

486
00:20:53,416 --> 00:20:55,083
[IZUKU]
Shoot style!

487
00:20:57,208 --> 00:20:59,083
[AIZAWA] So you think
we'll be taken out?

488
00:20:59,166 --> 00:21:02,083
I don't really see a reason
why I should've warned them.

489
00:21:02,166 --> 00:21:04,875
I doubt anything would've
changed if I had.

490
00:21:04,958 --> 00:21:07,208
They're still going to have
to overcome this, either way.

491
00:21:07,291 --> 00:21:08,250
[TOKOYAMI]
Dark Shadow!

492
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:09,583
[DARK SHADOW]
Got it!

493
00:21:13,541 --> 00:21:14,958
[SERO]
All right!

494
00:21:22,083 --> 00:21:25,083
[TENYA yells]

495
00:21:25,166 --> 00:21:27,333
Take this!

496
00:21:28,625 --> 00:21:30,416
Oh?

497
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:33,750
Real heroes could turn
this situation around.

498
00:21:33,833 --> 00:21:35,291
Besides, if they become pros,

499
00:21:35,375 --> 00:21:38,166
they'll face villains who
already know their Quirks.

500
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:39,500
Perhaps at UA,

501
00:21:39,583 --> 00:21:42,666
we look a little further
ahead than other schools.

502
00:21:43,791 --> 00:21:45,083
[IZUKU]
This can work!

503
00:21:45,166 --> 00:21:47,041
I've got my Shoot Style.

504
00:21:47,125 --> 00:21:49,541
And everyone else's powers
have grown, too.

505
00:21:49,625 --> 00:21:52,375
Our intensive training paid off.

506
00:21:52,458 --> 00:21:55,916
We've got this, you guys!
Show them what UA can do!

507
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,583
[STUDENTS]
Yeah!

508
00:23:29,083 --> 00:23:30,333
[IZUKU]
Here's the preview!

509
00:23:30,416 --> 00:23:32,666
The first test of the
provisional licensing exam

510
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:33,958
has begun!

511
00:23:34,041 --> 00:23:35,875
I get separated from
the rest of the class,

512
00:23:35,958 --> 00:23:38,666
and a girl from Shiketsu
High suddenly appears.

513
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:40,791
Next time:
"Shiketsu High Lurking"!

514
00:23:40,875 --> 00:23:43,500
Go beyond! Plus Ultra!
