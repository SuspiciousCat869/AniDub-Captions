1
00:00:09,833 --> 00:00:12,125
Kota's parents died
two years back.

2
00:00:12,208 --> 00:00:14,958
He was so small
when it happened.

3
00:00:15,041 --> 00:00:16,250
It was a villain.

4
00:00:16,333 --> 00:00:17,708
Huh?

5
00:00:17,791 --> 00:00:20,291
[MANDALAY] They were killed
while protecting citizens.

6
00:00:20,375 --> 00:00:24,041
Perhaps the most respectable
way for any hero to die.

7
00:00:24,125 --> 00:00:25,666
But...

8
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:29,083
[KOTA]
Papa. Mama.

9
00:00:29,166 --> 00:00:31,500
[MANDALAY] How do you even
begin to explain to a child

10
00:00:31,583 --> 00:00:34,541
that his parents died
honorable deaths?

11
00:00:34,625 --> 00:00:38,041
To him, they had
left him behind.

12
00:00:38,125 --> 00:00:40,291
And all the while,
they were being praised.

13
00:00:40,375 --> 00:00:42,916
Everybody kept telling him
that his parents' sacrifice

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,291
was noble.

15
00:00:44,375 --> 00:00:47,208
Heroes just don't make
any sense to Kota.

16
00:00:47,291 --> 00:00:49,541
After all, if his they
hadn't been heroes,

17
00:00:49,625 --> 00:00:51,500
they would still be here.

18
00:02:26,375 --> 00:02:30,083
[MANDALAY]
Trust me, Kota. It will happen.

19
00:02:30,166 --> 00:02:33,708
You'll meet someone,
and you'll finally understand

20
00:02:33,791 --> 00:02:35,791
why we do what we do.

21
00:02:35,875 --> 00:02:37,375
Someone who'll risk their life,

22
00:02:37,458 --> 00:02:41,958
put others first.
Someone who will be...

23
00:02:42,041 --> 00:02:44,833
No one like that really exists.

24
00:02:44,916 --> 00:02:47,541
[gasps]

25
00:02:49,583 --> 00:02:50,875
[MINETA]
No way!

26
00:02:50,958 --> 00:02:53,250
Why are there villains
attacking the camp?

27
00:02:53,333 --> 00:02:54,541
Pixie-Bob!

28
00:02:55,583 --> 00:02:58,833
This is bad.

29
00:02:58,916 --> 00:03:00,250
[gasps]

30
00:03:00,333 --> 00:03:02,041
Oh, no. Where's Kota?

31
00:03:04,791 --> 00:03:07,833
[ASHIDO] Aw... We wanted
the chance to face off

32
00:03:07,916 --> 00:03:09,250
with all the others.

33
00:03:09,333 --> 00:03:11,875
I thought Pixie-Bob said
we'd be getting a reward.

34
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:13,750
This is more like torture.

35
00:03:13,833 --> 00:03:16,208
We want our treat, Mr. Aizawa!

36
00:03:16,291 --> 00:03:18,250
Do you want me to
tighten your bindings?

37
00:03:19,333 --> 00:03:21,125
[AIZAWA] For tonight's lesson,
we'll be talking about

38
00:03:21,208 --> 00:03:23,250
how to behave in an emergency.

39
00:03:23,333 --> 00:03:24,666
If you don't become more aware

40
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:26,625
that you're falling
behind your classmates,

41
00:03:26,708 --> 00:03:28,458
then the gap will
keep on growing.

42
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:31,083
In a broad sense, this
knowledge is your reward.

43
00:03:31,166 --> 00:03:32,500
How's that for a treat?

44
00:03:32,583 --> 00:03:35,583
I knew I shouldn't have
gotten my hopes up.

45
00:03:35,666 --> 00:03:37,833
Oh, strange. Now,
who do we have here?

46
00:03:37,916 --> 00:03:40,666
Five members of Class A
bombed the exams?

47
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:42,500
And look, there's only
one guy from Class B!

48
00:03:42,583 --> 00:03:44,500
[KAMINARI]
You failed, too, idiot!

49
00:03:44,583 --> 00:03:47,250
He tried to get under our skin
the same way yesterday.

50
00:03:47,333 --> 00:03:49,500
At this point, I'm kinda
worried about him.

51
00:03:49,583 --> 00:03:50,666
So, Vlad.

52
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:52,583
Why don't we start
with practice maneuvers?

53
00:03:52,666 --> 00:03:54,541
I was thinking the same thing.

54
00:03:54,625 --> 00:03:56,500
Perhaps we should pair them up.

55
00:03:56,583 --> 00:03:57,875
[MANDALAY]
Everyone!

56
00:03:57,958 --> 00:03:59,333
[KIRISHIMA]
It's Mandalay's Telepath.

57
00:03:59,416 --> 00:04:01,833
So weird, right?
It's giving me chills.

58
00:04:01,916 --> 00:04:03,541
It is sort of annoying
that it only works

59
00:04:03,625 --> 00:04:04,416
in one direction, though.

60
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,125
Stop talking.

61
00:04:06,208 --> 00:04:07,541
[MANDALAY]
Two villains attacked us.

62
00:04:07,625 --> 00:04:09,208
It's possible there
are more coming.

63
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:11,208
Everyone, return to
camp immediately.

64
00:04:11,291 --> 00:04:14,166
We're regrouping.
Do not engage any enemies.

65
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:15,875
[AIZAWA] I'll look after
the other students.

66
00:04:15,958 --> 00:04:16,791
Protect them.

67
00:04:16,875 --> 00:04:18,041
[MONOMA]
Wasn't this a secret?

68
00:04:19,708 --> 00:04:21,708
[AIZAWA]
If it's a full-scale attack...

69
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:26,125
[AIZAWA]
We're in big trouble.

70
00:04:26,208 --> 00:04:29,125
Looks like your concern
has you distracted, Eraser.

71
00:04:29,208 --> 00:04:30,291
[AIZAWA]
Vlad!

72
00:04:32,083 --> 00:04:34,166
You pros oughta lay off.

73
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:35,916
We haven't come here
for any of you,

74
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,541
so just stay out of our way.

75
00:04:39,625 --> 00:04:42,416
[SPINNER] How are you this
evening, UA High School?

76
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,666
We are part of the
Vanguard Action Squad

77
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:46,625
of the League of Villains.

78
00:04:46,708 --> 00:04:48,125
[OJIRO]
The League of Villains?

79
00:04:48,208 --> 00:04:49,958
What are those guys doing here?

80
00:04:50,041 --> 00:04:53,583
[MAGNE] I could crush this
kitty's head so easily.

81
00:04:53,666 --> 00:04:55,583
How about it, dears, should I?

82
00:04:55,666 --> 00:04:57,083
You get away from her!

83
00:04:57,166 --> 00:04:59,791
Now, now. Hold on, Big Sis Mag.

84
00:04:59,875 --> 00:05:01,375
You, too, Tiger, calm down.

85
00:05:01,458 --> 00:05:03,625
When deciding if someone
should live or die,

86
00:05:03,708 --> 00:05:06,666
we must be careful that we're
abiding by Stain's principles.

87
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:07,875
Stain?

88
00:05:07,958 --> 00:05:10,125
So, you're the ones
he ended up inspiring.

89
00:05:10,208 --> 00:05:12,916
At your service. That's us.

90
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,041
And you, four eyes.
I believe I recognize you.

91
00:05:16,125 --> 00:05:17,750
You're one of the
self-righteous brats

92
00:05:17,833 --> 00:05:20,000
who attacked Stain in Hosu City.

93
00:05:20,083 --> 00:05:22,875
Lemme introduce myself.

94
00:05:22,958 --> 00:05:24,833
Call me, Spinner.

95
00:05:24,916 --> 00:05:27,416
I'm here to make Stain's
dreams a reality.

96
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:28,750
[gasps]

97
00:05:28,833 --> 00:05:31,875
[TIGER] I don't care who
you are. You're criminals!

98
00:05:31,958 --> 00:05:34,250
The woman lying there
is named Pixie-Bob.

99
00:05:34,333 --> 00:05:37,291
She's a pro hero who's
saved countless lives.

100
00:05:37,375 --> 00:05:40,000
She's giving her all
for these young heroes,

101
00:05:40,083 --> 00:05:43,250
pushing them to reach
their full potential.

102
00:05:43,333 --> 00:05:46,958
She's looking for a mate,
but otherwise she's content.

103
00:05:47,041 --> 00:05:50,000
What gives you the right to
cut such a happy life short?

104
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:51,250
Didn't anyone ever tell you

105
00:05:51,333 --> 00:05:53,333
it's not a hero's
job to be happy?!

106
00:05:53,416 --> 00:05:55,166
Tiger! I've talked to everyone.

107
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:57,333
Trust the safety of the
other students to Ragdoll.

108
00:05:57,416 --> 00:05:59,750
You and I will stay here.
We'll hold them back!

109
00:05:59,833 --> 00:06:01,041
You return to camp!

Class Rep, you're in charge
on the way there!

111
00:06:03,083 --> 00:06:04,125
Don't engage anyone!

112
00:06:04,208 --> 00:06:06,458
Leave it to me. Let's go!

Where'd you get those masks?

121
00:06:25,166 --> 00:06:26,583
[TETSUTETSU]
Yaoyorozu from Class A.

122
00:06:26,666 --> 00:06:28,416
She made them for us.

123
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,416
Awase's taking her to
the rest of our class

124
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,666
so she can help them, too.

125
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:34,416
Take some. We brought a bunch.

126
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:35,791
Great. Thanks!

127
00:06:37,541 --> 00:06:39,375
[KENDO] We need to get
back to camp fast.

128
00:06:39,458 --> 00:06:40,416
Who knows how many villains

129
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:41,541
could be roaming
through the woods.

130
00:06:41,625 --> 00:06:43,750
[TETSUTETSU]
No. I'm goin' to fight.

You make sure these two
get back to camp.

132
00:06:46,375 --> 00:06:49,291
[KENDO] What? Mandalay
told us to retreat!

133
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:50,750
[TETSUTETSU]
You're always getting on Monoma

134
00:06:50,833 --> 00:06:53,333
when he talks about the
differences in our classes,

135
00:06:53,416 --> 00:06:56,666
but you feel it, don't you?
We're not the same.

136
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:58,041
[KENDO gasps]

137
00:06:58,125 --> 00:07:00,791
[TETSUTETSU] We all got into
UA with the same exam.

138
00:07:00,875 --> 00:07:02,708
We study the same curriculum.

139
00:07:02,791 --> 00:07:05,541
So why are they better?
Isn't it obvious?

140
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:08,083
Class A has been through
crisis after crisis,

141
00:07:08,166 --> 00:07:10,458
and turned each one
into an opportunity.

142
00:07:10,541 --> 00:07:13,000
They've had so many
chances to prove themselves.

143
00:07:13,083 --> 00:07:14,500
And come on, Kendo.

144
00:07:14,583 --> 00:07:17,541
A real hero doesn't turn his
back and run from a bad guy.

145
00:07:17,625 --> 00:07:19,333
Fighting villains is what we do!

We're in the hero course.

If we don't stand up now,
then when will we?

00:15:24,916 --> 00:15:26,291
But what's your next move?

316
00:15:26,375 --> 00:15:29,041
You gonna punch me with that
puny Quirk of yours again?

317
00:15:29,125 --> 00:15:31,625
It's not a matter of
whether or not I can do it.

[IZUKU] A hero's job
is to risk his life,

00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:39,541
to turn his promises
into a reality!

Why?

[IZUKU] Let's get back
to camp. It's not far.

[IZUKU]
No way. It can't be.

Naw, attacking sounds more fun.

[IZUKU] It's no good.
What am I supposed to do now?

340
00:16:44,125 --> 00:16:45,791
I just need some time to think.

341
00:16:45,875 --> 00:16:47,958
Tell me. Why have you come here?

342
00:16:48,041 --> 00:16:49,416
What does the League
want from us?

Doesn't matter to me,

344
00:16:50,833 --> 00:16:53,416
I'm just glad they finally
let me off the leash.

345
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:57,500
Long as I get to use my Quirk
all I want, I really don't care.

346
00:16:57,583 --> 00:16:59,541
Remember what
I told you earlier.

347
00:16:59,625 --> 00:17:01,500
We've just been playing around.

348
00:17:01,583 --> 00:17:04,291
Having fun. Until now.

349
00:17:04,375 --> 00:17:06,416
Now, I'm serious!

Quick. Grab on! Hurry!

355
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:25,416
[IZUKU] It's like his Quirk
has been supercharged.

356
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,416
It's completely insane.

357
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:29,541
He really was just
playing around,

00:17:29,625 --> 00:17:31,708
toying with me
before he killed me.

[IZUKU]
If we can just get back to camp,

362
00:17:44,541 --> 00:17:46,250
Mr. Aizawa should be there.

363
00:17:46,333 --> 00:17:48,375
Then he can erase
this guy's Quirk.

364
00:17:48,458 --> 00:17:49,833
Yeah, that's it!

365
00:17:49,916 --> 00:17:53,125
I need to get him to
chase after me and Kota.

But...

I'm so tired from the
training today. It won't work!

If I turn my back on
this guy, I'm done for.

I have no choice but to
fight him right here.

Right now!

I have to remember where
I started, how far I've come.

I'll stand my ground.

And I'll make sure Kota is safe!

And then, when it's time,

run as fast as you
can back to camp.

You can't do that!
Let's just go! Come on!

him earlier, remember?
