00:00:10,416 --> 00:00:13,041
[IZUKU] Welcome to UA High,
the prestigious school

2
00:00:13,125 --> 00:00:16,125
that's turned out some of
the world's greatest heroes.

3
00:00:16,208 --> 00:00:18,250
I'm running toward
my dream in these halls.

4
00:00:18,333 --> 00:00:20,375
Learning to overcome
obstacles and save people

5
00:00:20,458 --> 00:00:22,875
with a smile on my face.

6
00:00:22,958 --> 00:00:25,833
That's how I'll become the
greatest hero in the world!

7
00:02:02,041 --> 00:02:03,875
[COMMISSIONER 59A]
Targets and balls?

8
00:02:03,958 --> 00:02:06,666
Sounds more like a game
than an examination.

9
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:07,916
Is it too easy?

10
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,791
You're not seeing
the bigger picture.

11
00:02:09,875 --> 00:02:12,583
The real test is how they
handle the ensuing chaos.

12
00:02:12,666 --> 00:02:13,916
Will they panic?

13
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,916
Or maintain the level head
of a pro who utilizes

14
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,958
their Quirk to make
wise decisions.

15
00:02:18,041 --> 00:02:19,875
It's crisis response.

16
00:02:19,958 --> 00:02:22,125
[COMMISSIONER 59A] And the
second round is the same way?

17
00:02:22,208 --> 00:02:24,125
We normally focused
on individuals,

18
00:02:24,208 --> 00:02:25,750
not how well they work together.

19
00:02:25,833 --> 00:02:28,416
This proposal came from
the National Police Agency.

20
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,250
They've revised
the exam criteria

21
00:02:30,333 --> 00:02:32,250
and the way we grant licenses.

22
00:02:32,333 --> 00:02:34,750
We have to abide
by their orders.

23
00:02:34,833 --> 00:02:36,333
We're to assume that,
at this level,

24
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:38,458
all examinees will
have knowledge of basic

25
00:02:38,541 --> 00:02:40,875
emergency procedures
and first aid.

26
00:02:40,958 --> 00:02:42,833
Therefore, we'll be
paying closer attention

27
00:02:42,916 --> 00:02:44,833
to how they cooperate
with each other.

28
00:02:44,916 --> 00:02:47,166
[COMMISSIONER 59A]
Heh. Teamwork, huh?

29
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:48,041
All right.

30
00:02:48,125 --> 00:02:51,291
It's necessary for our future.

31
00:02:51,375 --> 00:02:52,625
People loved All Might

32
00:02:52,708 --> 00:02:55,916
not just for his strength,
but for his personality.

33
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,208
We must accept the fact
that the number-two hero

34
00:02:58,291 --> 00:03:00,666
is no replacement.

35
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:04,958
It will be difficult to find
someone so charismatic.

36
00:03:05,041 --> 00:03:07,208
Rather than waiting
for the next All Might,

37
00:03:07,291 --> 00:03:10,041
we should fill the hole he has
left with an army of heroes

38
00:03:10,125 --> 00:03:13,333
boasting a strong sense
of unity and comradery.

39
00:03:13,416 --> 00:03:16,291
And the exam now
reflects that goal.

40
00:03:17,791 --> 00:03:20,750
[MERA] Well, the second round
of the test is underway.

41
00:03:20,833 --> 00:03:24,708
Rescuing people injured in a
large-scale terrorist incident.

42
00:03:24,791 --> 00:03:27,750
And dealing with the
villain behind the attack.

43
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:30,958
[IZUKU]
What happened?

44
00:03:33,333 --> 00:03:36,125
[GANG ORCA]
Tell me, wannabe heroes.

45
00:03:36,208 --> 00:03:41,041
Can you rescue people and
fight at the same time?

46
00:03:41,125 --> 00:03:43,666
That's Gang Orca!

47
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:45,333
[MERA] During the
search-and-destroy mission

48
00:03:45,416 --> 00:03:47,208
against the League of Villains,

49
00:03:47,291 --> 00:03:52,208
Gang Orca fought alongside
Endeavor and Best Jeanist.

50
00:03:52,291 --> 00:03:54,250
He's a strong pro.

51
00:03:57,291 --> 00:03:59,250
[MERA] The terrorists have
appeared and are beginning

52
00:03:59,333 --> 00:04:02,208
to sweep the area. Hero
candidates at the scene should

53
00:04:02,291 --> 00:04:04,750
continue their rescue efforts
while also suppressing

54
00:04:04,833 --> 00:04:06,208
the newly-arrived villains.

55
00:04:06,291 --> 00:04:08,375
[TENYA] We're going to have
to save people and battle?

56
00:04:08,458 --> 00:04:09,416
Are they serious?!

57
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:10,750
Jeez! Come on!

58
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:13,458
Aren't they expecting
too much from us?

59
00:04:13,541 --> 00:04:16,250
Even for a pro,
this would be difficult.

60
00:04:16,333 --> 00:04:18,625
They're going a
little far, I'd say.

61
00:04:20,583 --> 00:04:24,458
[GANG ORCA]
Now. How will you react?

62
00:04:24,541 --> 00:04:27,041
Will you fight or protect?

63
00:04:27,125 --> 00:04:32,416
Help, or run away?
What would a hero do?

64
00:04:37,708 --> 00:04:38,625
[OJIRO]
Another attack?

65
00:04:38,708 --> 00:04:41,291
Look! By the first aid station!

66
00:04:41,375 --> 00:04:42,750
[OJIRO]
Not good.

67
00:04:42,833 --> 00:04:44,583
[ASHIDO] Right by all those
hurt kids and old people?!

68
00:04:44,666 --> 00:04:46,208
That's so mean!

69
00:04:46,291 --> 00:04:48,833
We still have a lot
of bystanders to rescue.

70
00:04:48,916 --> 00:04:51,750
But we can't just
ignore the villains.

71
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:52,916
I know.

72
00:04:54,291 --> 00:04:56,125
[MERA] For this second test,
everyone starts out

73
00:04:56,208 --> 00:04:58,083
with a certain number of points.

74
00:04:58,166 --> 00:05:00,791
They'll be judged on
how many they lose.

75
00:05:00,875 --> 00:05:02,791
HUC evaluates whether
or not someone's

76
00:05:02,875 --> 00:05:05,125
acting properly during
their rescue.

77
00:05:05,208 --> 00:05:07,000
For example: if the examinee

78
00:05:07,083 --> 00:05:08,541
has put themselves
in the position

79
00:05:08,625 --> 00:05:10,416
to best use their Quirk.

80
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,791
Additionally, there are
one hundred employees

81
00:05:12,875 --> 00:05:14,958
of the Public Safety
Commission who are grading

82
00:05:15,041 --> 00:05:18,041
each person individually,
based on the scoring manual

83
00:05:18,125 --> 00:05:20,416
and the examinee's background.

84
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,416
Students automatically
fail the moment

85
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:25,708
their total score
falls below 50 points.

86
00:05:25,791 --> 00:05:27,791
I hope everyone down
there has the patience

87
00:05:27,875 --> 00:05:29,916
to make smart decisions.

88
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:33,833
[SHINDO]
Get everyone to safety!

[SHINDO]
Do it!

the villains as possible!

Right!

00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:40,791
I'll start hammering
away at the henchmen

94
00:05:40,875 --> 00:05:43,125
at one second intervals.

[IZUKU]

[GANG ORCA] A single rear
guard to hold us back?

You've underestimated me.

[PRESENT MIC]
Gang Orca! Quirk, Orcinus!

105
00:06:05,666 --> 00:06:08,208
He can do whatever an
orca can, even on land.

106
00:06:08,291 --> 00:06:10,250
That includes using
an ultrasonic wave

107
00:06:10,333 --> 00:06:12,666
to paralyze his prey!

We found hurt people
over by the river.

115
00:06:30,166 --> 00:06:31,625
Everybody else ran
to the city first,

116
00:06:31,708 --> 00:06:33,791
so we were searching
on the outskirts.

117
00:06:33,875 --> 00:06:37,041
Yaoyorozu and Asui stayed behind
to search for survivors.

118
00:06:37,125 --> 00:06:40,333
But we couldn't stand by and
watch these villains do this.

[GANG ORCA]
Your power is nothing.

[OJIRO]
Good timing.

00:07:08,541 --> 00:07:10,166

[COMMISSIONER 59C]
Good.

132
00:07:14,583 --> 00:07:16,125
They're prioritizing the safety
of the first-aid station,

133
00:07:16,208 --> 00:07:19,250
which is the cornerstone
of the entire rescue effort.

That's smart of them.

That's my line.

Everything you say
is a distraction.

station instead?

so you'd get all the glory!

I do something like that?

My old man's got
nothing to do--

160
00:08:31,875 --> 00:08:33,666
[ORCA TERRORIST 59B]
Like my Cement Gun?

161
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:36,416
Good luck tryin' to move
when that hardens up.

162
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,125
[GANG ORCA]
This is outrageous.

163
00:08:38,208 --> 00:08:40,666
I can't believe you're arguing.

164
00:08:43,291 --> 00:08:45,958
[YOARASHI]
This has everything to do...

165
00:08:46,041 --> 00:08:49,041
...with your
cold-blooded father.

166
00:08:49,125 --> 00:08:52,625
To me, heroes should
be full of passion.

167
00:08:52,708 --> 00:08:55,083
They bring hope and
inspiration to people

168
00:08:55,166 --> 00:08:57,416
with the fire burning
in their hearts.

169
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,000
They care!

170
00:09:00,208 --> 00:09:03,333
[ENDEAVOR]
Move it. You're in my way.

171
00:09:05,875 --> 00:09:08,875
[YOARASHI] It was a shock
to meet your father.

172
00:09:08,958 --> 00:09:11,125
Because the only thing
I could see in his eyes

173
00:09:11,208 --> 00:09:14,833
was an insatiable anger
aimed at the entire world.

174
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,833
[YOARASHI] And then, at the
entrance exam, I saw you,

175
00:09:21,916 --> 00:09:25,041
and I knew who you
were immediately.

176
00:09:25,125 --> 00:09:27,875
Because when I said hello...

177
00:09:27,958 --> 00:09:29,666
[TODOROKI]
You're in the way.

178
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:32,583
[YOARASHI]
Your eyes were the same as his.

179
00:09:34,291 --> 00:09:36,375
You think we're the same?

180
00:09:36,458 --> 00:09:38,250
Don't be ridiculous.

181
00:09:40,625 --> 00:09:43,833
You're a fool.
I'm nothing like him.

182
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:47,916
[TODOROKI]
I have to stop listening.

183
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,458
He's just someone
who hates my father.

184
00:09:50,541 --> 00:09:52,750
He doesn't really know me.

185
00:09:52,833 --> 00:09:56,625
I have to focus on the test.

186
00:09:56,708 --> 00:09:58,833
I have to keep my cool.

187
00:09:58,916 --> 00:10:01,875
I have no feelings about
my old man anymore.

188
00:10:04,375 --> 00:10:09,208
[TODOROKI] No. There is
still some hate inside me.

189
00:10:09,291 --> 00:10:11,833
Dammit. This is no good.

190
00:10:14,208 --> 00:10:15,458
[GANG ORCA]
Hmph.

191
00:10:15,541 --> 00:10:18,250
A villain in front of you
and you've done nothing.

192
00:10:18,333 --> 00:10:20,000
Jeez.

193
00:10:20,083 --> 00:10:21,875
You and your father
are the only heroes

194
00:10:21,958 --> 00:10:23,041
I can't accept.

195
00:10:23,125 --> 00:10:25,625
You don't deserve
the title. Understand?

196
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:27,416
Now move!

197
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:28,583
[TODOROKI]
Focus.

198
00:10:30,333 --> 00:10:32,791

[TODOROKI]
No! He'll be incinerated!

Dammit. What are you two doing?!

201
00:10:55,958 --> 00:10:58,208
[YOARASHI] I've never
been afraid of anything.

202
00:10:58,291 --> 00:11:01,541
Even when I was a kid,
I was fearless.

203
00:11:01,625 --> 00:11:03,791
[YOARASHI]
Ah! It's so fast and cool!

204
00:11:03,875 --> 00:11:05,291
[CLASSMATES scream]

205
00:11:05,375 --> 00:11:07,541
I dig these little bugs.

206
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:10,916
[YOARASHI] I could find reasons
to like just about anything.

207
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,750
That's why, the minute I
understood what a hero was,

208
00:11:14,833 --> 00:11:17,375
I knew what I was going
to be when I grew up.

209
00:11:17,458 --> 00:11:19,583
Tackling crises,
rescuing people,

210
00:11:19,666 --> 00:11:21,875
risking their lives for
the sake of the world.

211
00:11:21,958 --> 00:11:23,958
That took real passion!

212
00:11:25,333 --> 00:11:28,208
[YOARASHI] Which is why I
couldn't understand him.

213
00:11:28,291 --> 00:11:29,791
Endeavor.

214
00:11:29,875 --> 00:11:33,833
Who had eyes that seemed
to hate everything they saw.

215
00:11:33,916 --> 00:11:37,083
He was the only thing
I couldn't stand.

[PRESENT MIC]
Rock on!

The written part of the

00:11:42,791 --> 00:11:46,208
The practical's next. And then,
finally, the interview.

219
00:11:46,291 --> 00:11:48,708
You'll go six at a time
for the practical.

220
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:51,125
Get steppin' when
your number's called.

221
00:11:51,208 --> 00:11:53,416
The exam will be
a three-kilometer race.

222
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:54,666
But, it's an obstacle course,

223
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:56,541
so you can't just run
straight through it.

224

Use your Quirks to
reach the finish!

225

[YOARASHI] This is it.
The best hero school in Japan.

[buzzer blares]

227

[YOARASHI] The most passionate

is waiting for me.

[YOARASHI] Making an ice path
to move. That's smart.

I really didn't like
the look in his eyes.

231
00:12:17,458 --> 00:12:20,000
But his abilities are on fire!

232
00:12:20,083 --> 00:12:22,833
He'll probably be
accepted after this.

233
00:12:22,916 --> 00:12:25,041
Then maybe I can become
friends with him,

234
00:12:25,125 --> 00:12:27,291
and his eyes won't
bother me anymore!

finishes first by a hair!

Why didn't I remember him?

He's so loud and obnoxious.

really seeing him back then.

We'll split up and get
the remaining injured

313
00:16:00,666 --> 00:16:02,125
to the shelter.

314
00:16:02,208 --> 00:16:03,166
[IZUKU]
Right!

315
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:04,708
[GANG ORCA]
Now, then.

316
00:16:04,791 --> 00:16:09,083
I'll take down the wind-user
and continue with the attack.

317
00:16:09,166 --> 00:16:12,250
[TODOROKI] We competed with
each other for no reason.

318
00:16:12,333 --> 00:16:16,791
Our Quirks aren't compatible,
and we have zero teamwork.

319
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:18,708
There's no way we
can beat a top hero

320
00:16:18,791 --> 00:16:21,333
when we're at odds like this.

321
00:16:21,416 --> 00:16:25,666
Hopefully, he understands, too,
and feels the same way I do.

322
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:29,125
[YOARASHI]
The heat makes the air rise up!

323
00:16:29,208 --> 00:16:32,416
[TODOROKI]
Come on. Work with me.

324
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:34,291
[YOARASHI] I'm so numb
that I can't put much

325
00:16:34,375 --> 00:16:37,041
into my Quirk, but...

326
00:16:37,125 --> 00:16:39,166
I have to do this!

327
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:45,750
[TODOROKI]
With fire...

328
00:16:45,833 --> 00:16:47,000
[YOARASHI]
...and wind...

329
00:16:47,083 --> 00:16:48,916
[TODOROKI, YOARASHI]
...we'll trap you!

330
00:16:52,958 --> 00:16:55,541
[GANG ORCA]
He didn't even move his body.

331
00:16:55,625 --> 00:16:58,666
His strength and
accuracy have decreased,

332
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:01,583
but his incapacity
wasn't complete.

333
00:17:01,666 --> 00:17:04,166
He's able to control his Quirk.

334
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:06,625
Barely. And this one.

335
00:17:06,708 --> 00:17:08,625
Todoroki can't move either.

336
00:17:08,708 --> 00:17:12,500
But he's adding his raw power
to Yoarashi's attack.

337
00:17:12,583 --> 00:17:15,583
This won't make up for
their foolishness earlier,

338
00:17:15,666 --> 00:17:19,041
but it's not a bad start.

339
00:17:20,125 --> 00:17:22,541
[GANG ORCA]
They realized their mistake.

340
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:26,125
And as such, they're trying
to make up for it.

341
00:17:26,208 --> 00:17:29,375
I have to admire
their persistence.

342
00:17:29,458 --> 00:17:30,583
[ORCA TERRORIST 59A]
Hey, behind us!

343
00:17:30,666 --> 00:17:31,708
[ORCA TERRORIST 59B]
The boss is trapped by

344
00:17:31,791 --> 00:17:33,000
some kinda fire tornado!

345
00:17:33,083 --> 00:17:34,500
[ORCA TERRORIST 59C]
Isn't that bad?

346
00:17:34,583 --> 00:17:36,958
He's an orca, so he's super
weak when he gets dried out!

347
00:17:37,041 --> 00:17:38,916
Forget the wind. Stop the flame!

348
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,291
[ORCA TERRORIST 59A]
What?

349
00:17:42,375 --> 00:17:44,625
[ORCA TERRORIST 59C]
Todoroki! He used both sides!

350
00:17:44,708 --> 00:17:47,791
[TODOROKI] If I could only use
both sides at the same time.

351
00:17:47,875 --> 00:17:51,750
Switching slows me down.
I need to practice more.

352
00:17:51,833 --> 00:17:53,333
[TODOROKI]
When I can't move,

353
00:17:53,416 --> 00:17:55,541
my speed doesn't
make a difference.

354
00:17:55,625 --> 00:17:56,916
[ORCA TERRORIST 59D]
Should we go back and help?

355
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:57,833
[ORCA TERRORIST 59E]
Hey! Look out!

356
00:17:57,916 --> 00:18:00,583
[IZUKU]
Smash!

357
00:18:00,666 --> 00:18:01,708
We can stop them.

358
00:18:01,791 --> 00:18:03,083
[ORCA TERRORIST 59F]
Keep shooting!

359
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:06,208
[OJIRO]
I'll take this.

360
00:18:08,208 --> 00:18:09,291
--Nice moves.
--[OJIRO] 'Kay.

361
00:18:09,375 --> 00:18:11,125
The injured have
all been evacuated,

362
00:18:11,208 --> 00:18:13,791
and reinforcements should
be here any minute now.

363
00:18:15,833 --> 00:18:18,875
[MERA] Looks like almost
all of HUC has been rescued.

364
00:18:18,958 --> 00:18:20,916
They only have three
people to get to safety

365
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,458
before they're done.

366
00:18:22,541 --> 00:18:25,625
Then, the test will
be over for the year.

367
00:18:25,708 --> 00:18:27,000
They just have to do their best

368
00:18:27,083 --> 00:18:30,625
to hold Gang Orca
off until then.

369
00:18:30,708 --> 00:18:34,416
I'll be able to sleep soon.

370
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:35,666
Hey, guys! You miss me?

371
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:37,083
We're here to help.

372
00:18:37,166 --> 00:18:39,833
[ORCA TERRORIST 59G]
Mow them down! Don't let up!

373
00:18:39,916 --> 00:18:40,958
[TSUYU]
Ribbit!

374
00:18:42,708 --> 00:18:45,416
Asui--er, Tsu! When did
you sneak over here?

375
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,250
[TSUYU] I've been training
my frog skills,

376
00:18:47,333 --> 00:18:49,750
and I've finally reached
a new level of control.

377
00:18:49,833 --> 00:18:52,416
Camouflage. That's my
new special move.

378
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:53,750
[OJIRO]
Wow, Asui.

379
00:18:53,833 --> 00:18:55,875
Are you done with the search
and rescue already?

380
00:18:55,958 --> 00:18:56,958
For the most part.

381
00:18:57,041 --> 00:18:58,375
Ribbit! Look out!

00:18:58,458 --> 00:19:01,416

[OJIRO]
Shiketsu High!

384
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,541
[MORA]
I sent Inasa here to help.

385
00:19:06,625 --> 00:19:09,541
But he has disgraced
on our school's name.

386
00:19:09,625 --> 00:19:11,875
There should be no enemies left.

387
00:19:13,333 --> 00:19:14,125
So strong!

388
00:19:14,208 --> 00:19:15,041
Yeah.

389
00:19:15,125 --> 00:19:16,625
We're not done yet.

[TSUYU]
Ribbit.

391
00:19:24,375 --> 00:19:27,291
[GANG ORCA] A cyclone
prison of wind and fire.

392
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:31,166
Not bad. An ordinary
villain would give up.

393
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:34,083
Would weep and beg your mercy.

394
00:19:34,166 --> 00:19:36,083
But what would you do,

395
00:19:36,166 --> 00:19:39,000
if your desperate
trap was not enough.

396
00:19:39,083 --> 00:19:42,333
You must always be
planning your next move.

397
00:19:51,666 --> 00:19:54,458
So... What now?

398
00:19:55,833 --> 00:19:58,000
[TODOROKI]

--[buzzer blares]
--[IZUKU] Huh?

403
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:18,625
[MERA] Um, yeah, so, at this
time, all of the HUC members

404
00:20:18,708 --> 00:20:22,666
who were deployed have been
rescued from the disaster zone.

405
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:23,833
[KAMINARI]
Huh?Really?

406
00:20:23,916 --> 00:20:25,666
We were the last ones?

407
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:28,333
[MERA] It may seem
anticlimactic, but with this,

408
00:20:28,416 --> 00:20:33,250
the provisional licensing exam
has officially been completed.

409
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:34,958
It's over?

410
00:20:35,041 --> 00:20:36,416
[MERA]
After we tally the scores,

411
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:39,166
we'll announce the results
here in the arena.

412
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:41,750
Anyone injured should
go to the infirmary.

413
00:20:41,833 --> 00:20:43,416
The rest of you are
free to change clothes

414
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:46,375
and wait wherever you like.

415
00:20:46,458 --> 00:20:47,625
[ORCA TERRORIST 59A]
Sorry, Boss.

416
00:20:47,708 --> 00:20:50,541
I guess we didn't do our
job all that well, huh?

417
00:20:50,625 --> 00:20:51,583
And your restraining gear

418
00:20:51,666 --> 00:20:54,666
must've made it
pretty hard to move.

419
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:57,875
[GANG ORCA] No. The gear
wasn't the problem.

420
00:20:57,958 --> 00:21:01,625
That tower of flame
was an inspired attack.

421
00:21:01,708 --> 00:21:03,666
And with Midoriya's
surprise counter

422
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:05,833
once I had been weakened...

423
00:21:05,916 --> 00:21:09,166
We might have had a hard
time if the test went on.

00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:11,875

Okay. Everyone.

Thanks for your hard
work in today's exam.

427
00:21:19,958 --> 00:21:22,291
Now, before I
announce the results.

428
00:21:22,375 --> 00:21:26,041
I should probably explain
the way we evaluated you.

429
00:21:26,125 --> 00:21:27,500
Between HUC, and those of us

430
00:21:27,583 --> 00:21:29,750
at the Heroes Public
Safety Commission,

431
00:21:29,833 --> 00:21:32,125
we had a two-fold demerit
system that we used

432
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:34,458
to determine your total scores.

433
00:21:34,541 --> 00:21:36,875
In other words, we were
evaluating you based on

434
00:21:36,958 --> 00:21:41,666
how few mistakes you made
in a crisis situation.

435
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:44,291
Anyway, the names
of those who passed

436
00:21:44,375 --> 00:21:46,875
are listed here in
alphabetical order.
