[MIYAGI] The fact of the

[BUSINESSMAN 62A] It's not
that I don't like Endeavor,

I just can't help but
compare him to All Might.

38
00:03:21,666 --> 00:03:22,958
And, you know,
that's kind of a lot

39

live up to, right?

[BUBAIGAWARA] Yeah, he's
not really a cuddly person.

beyond his control,

45
00:03:36,541 --> 00:03:40,333
he's inherited a role that
he's totally unsuited for.

[MIYAGI]
Although Endeavor has resolved

gone overboard many times.

They do not like him.
He's just no replacement.

This is a prime example
of why those of us

54
00:04:01,416 --> 00:04:03,375

reporting negatively

raise excitement for them.

Instead of focusing on
the problems we're facing,

For any regular Joe,
that was reassuring.

00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:16,333
An entire gang of just me.

157
00:08:16,416 --> 00:08:18,583
I made my clones do everything.

158
00:08:18,666 --> 00:08:21,500
I was a king ruling over them.

159
00:08:21,583 --> 00:08:24,291
But, the other mes weren't
satisfied with that.

160
00:08:24,375 --> 00:08:26,833
And they put together
a little coup.

161
00:08:27,916 --> 00:08:30,791
[TWICE]
I was almost killed by myself.

162
00:08:30,875 --> 00:08:32,583
The things I make
don't disappear

163
00:08:32,666 --> 00:08:35,250
until they've taken
some serious damage.

164
00:08:35,333 --> 00:08:38,375
Before long, all of us were
arguing with each other.

165
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:41,875
Each one of us thinking
we were actually the real me.

166
00:08:41,958 --> 00:08:44,458
This absurd
self-mutilation continued

167
00:08:44,541 --> 00:08:47,625
for nine days.
Can you imagine that?

168
00:08:47,708 --> 00:08:50,125
In the end, they
killed each other.

169
00:08:50,208 --> 00:08:52,916
And disappeared. All gone.

170
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,250
Ever since then,
I haven't been sure

171
00:08:55,333 --> 00:08:57,208
that I'm the real me.

172
00:08:57,291 --> 00:09:00,583
How could I be after
all the madness?

173
00:09:00,666 --> 00:09:02,375
And there's no
place in the world

174
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:04,583
where crazy people can belong.

175
00:09:04,666 --> 00:09:08,125
Heroes only care about
saving good citizens.

176
00:09:08,208 --> 00:09:10,416
But the league
accepted me as I am,

177
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:11,833
problems and all.

178
00:09:11,916 --> 00:09:15,458
And I'd like to think I'm
okay with who I am, too.

179
00:09:15,541 --> 00:09:17,166
Now, I'm scouting people.

180
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:20,416
Trying to find the ones
with the same kind of crazy.

181
00:09:22,125 --> 00:09:26,250
[TWICE] We're all wackos
lookin' for a place we belong.

182
00:09:26,333 --> 00:09:29,000
[CHISAKI] A bunch of capable
adults got together

183
00:09:29,083 --> 00:09:32,958
and all they stole was a
convenience store register?

184
00:09:33,041 --> 00:09:34,666
Heh.

185
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:39,375
This big a gang, they should
have shot for a loftier goal.

186
00:09:40,541 --> 00:09:43,375
[CHISAKI]
You guys aren't well.

187
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:46,125
What you need is a cure.

188
00:09:46,208 --> 00:09:47,541
[KURONO]
We got the money.

189
00:09:47,625 --> 00:09:50,625
We should skedaddle before
any heroes get here, yeah?

190
00:09:50,708 --> 00:09:52,416
Overhaul.

191
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:57,458
[CHISAKI] They're all sick.
Every last one of them.

192
00:09:57,541 --> 00:09:59,708
[TWICE] But the biggest wackos
have stopped searching

193
00:09:59,791 --> 00:10:02,583
for a place to belong
and created their own.

194
00:10:02,666 --> 00:10:05,375
Both the hero side and
our side have started

195
00:10:05,458 --> 00:10:07,916
changing in unexpected ways.

196
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Still. What's important is
knowing who you truly are.

197
00:10:12,083 --> 00:10:14,166
What you wanna become.

198
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:16,166
What you wanna do.

199
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:19,208
Yes. That's very important.

200
00:10:19,291 --> 00:10:22,166
So. What should I do?

201
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:41,416
[IZUKU] There's hardly any
pain or weird sensations.

202
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:43,166
[DOCTOR 46A]
In other words, if you sustain

203
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:47,000
this type of injury, even
just two or three more times,

204
00:10:47,083 --> 00:10:48,083
I don't think you're
going to be able

205
00:10:48,166 --> 00:10:50,083
to move your arms anymore.

206
00:10:50,166 --> 00:10:51,708
I was really careful
to hold back

207
00:10:51,791 --> 00:10:54,291
when I threw a punch
against Kacchan yesterday.

208
00:10:54,375 --> 00:10:57,125
But when I'm not fully under
control of my emotions,

209
00:10:57,208 --> 00:10:59,791
I should be extra careful
to not use my arms.

210
00:10:59,875 --> 00:11:02,958
Instead, I'll concentrate
on my Shoot Style.

211
00:11:05,291 --> 00:11:06,541
Listen up, everyone.

212
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:08,916
Stay in line and move
promptly into position.

213
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,208
I want to see order!

214
00:11:10,291 --> 00:11:12,875
Uh. You're the only one
who's not in line.

215
00:11:12,958 --> 00:11:15,166
[TENYA]
The dilemma of a class rep!

216
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:17,791
I heard a little rumor
about Class 1-A.

217
00:11:17,875 --> 00:11:19,291
Two people!

218
00:11:19,375 --> 00:11:22,250
You had two people fail the
licensing exam, you losers!

219
00:11:22,333 --> 00:11:23,625
Monoma from Class B.

220
00:11:23,708 --> 00:11:25,875
He's just as uhinged as usual.

221
00:11:25,958 --> 00:11:28,166
Bet you were the only one
in your class to fail.

222
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:29,708
Just like in the final, huh?

223
00:11:29,791 --> 00:11:32,625
[laughs]

224
00:11:32,708 --> 00:11:34,041
That wasn't an answer!

225
00:11:34,125 --> 00:11:37,291
Ha! Actually...

226
00:11:37,375 --> 00:11:39,041
Every one of us passed.

227
00:11:39,125 --> 00:11:42,000
We've pulled ahead
of you big shots.

228
00:11:42,083 --> 00:11:44,250
I'm sorry. It's my fault.

229
00:11:44,333 --> 00:11:46,375
They're the ones who're
turning it into a competition.

230
00:11:46,458 --> 00:11:47,625
It's no big deal.

231
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:49,875
Accordin' ta teacher Vlad,
we'll have classes

232
00:11:49,958 --> 00:11:53,208
together this semester--doesn't
that sound like it'll be fun?

233
00:11:53,291 --> 00:11:54,833
I'm lookin' forward to it.

234
00:11:54,916 --> 00:11:56,708
[KIRISHIMA] I can't wait
to test out my skills!

235
00:11:56,791 --> 00:11:59,125
Oh hey, isn't she
the exchange student?

236
00:11:59,208 --> 00:12:00,541
Touch me and I'll
pummel you till

237
00:12:00,625 --> 00:12:02,458
yo mama doesn't know ya.

238
00:12:03,541 --> 00:12:05,083
[laughs]

239
00:12:05,166 --> 00:12:07,916
Stop filling her
mind with crazy!

240
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,125
[SHINSO] Hey. We're tryin'
to get through back here.

241
00:12:10,208 --> 00:12:12,375
Our apologies.
Come on, everyone.

242
00:12:12,458 --> 00:12:13,666
Save your chit chat for later.

243
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:15,375
We're clogging up the hallways.

244
00:12:15,458 --> 00:12:18,166
I honestly can't believe
how uncool you are.

245
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:19,416
Shinso.

246
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,000
Oh right, the guy
who fought Midoriya

247
00:12:21,083 --> 00:12:22,166
at the sports festival.

248
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:24,000
You sure that's the same guy?

249
00:12:24,083 --> 00:12:26,625
Looks like he's bulked up
a bit since then.

250
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:33,416
Hi there! It's the
adorable small mammal

251
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:36,000
you all know and love,
the principal.

252
00:12:36,083 --> 00:12:38,000
You may notice the
fur I'm so proud of

253
00:12:38,083 --> 00:12:39,875
has deteriorated in quality.

254
00:12:39,958 --> 00:12:42,041
I haven't been
taking care of it.

255
00:12:42,125 --> 00:12:44,833
This is something that can
happen to humans, too.

256
00:12:44,916 --> 00:12:48,083
Even if you eat a balanced diet
full of vitamins and minerals,

257
00:12:48,166 --> 00:12:49,833
you won't have a mane
of luscious locks

258
00:12:49,916 --> 00:12:53,083
unless you're getting lots
of sleep. That's the secret!

259
00:12:53,166 --> 00:12:55,166
Disturbances in your
normal resting patterns

260
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:56,958
are terrible for your hair.

261
00:12:57,041 --> 00:12:58,500
So, if you want to
improve your fur's...

262
00:12:58,583 --> 00:13:00,916
[OJIRO] Is this really
important right now?

263
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,958
[KAMINARI]
Please tell me he's almost done.

264
00:13:03,041 --> 00:13:05,625
My own sleep cycle has been
upset by the incidents

265
00:13:05,708 --> 00:13:07,500
that took place over
summer vacation,

266
00:13:07,583 --> 00:13:11,125
which I'm sure everyone
here knows about already.

267
00:13:11,208 --> 00:13:13,541
We lost a pillar of hope.

268
00:13:13,625 --> 00:13:15,833
The ramifications of which
have appeared faster

269
00:13:15,916 --> 00:13:17,916
than I could have ever imagined.

270
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,750
And there will likely
be even more chaos

271
00:13:19,833 --> 00:13:22,333
throughout our world
in the near future.

272
00:13:22,416 --> 00:13:23,500
In particular,

273
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:25,250
this will be most
apparent to those of you

274
00:13:25,333 --> 00:13:27,500
studying in the hero course.

275
00:13:27,583 --> 00:13:30,416
You must approach
extracurricular activities,

276
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:32,416
like the hero work
studies available

277
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:33,958
to second and third years,

278
00:13:34,041 --> 00:13:35,833
with a greater
sense of caution...

279
00:13:35,916 --> 00:13:37,583
Hero work studies?

280
00:13:37,666 --> 00:13:39,000
Maybe they're the next level

281
00:13:39,083 --> 00:13:40,958
after the internships
we already did?

282
00:13:41,041 --> 00:13:42,583
[NEZU]
The air always feels heavy

283
00:13:42,666 --> 00:13:44,708
when we talk about
gloomy subjects.

284
00:13:44,791 --> 00:13:47,083
But, rest assured, your
teachers are working hard

285
00:13:47,166 --> 00:13:49,875
to remove this weight
from yours shoulders.

286
00:13:49,958 --> 00:13:52,291
I'd like all of you to learn
from their diligence,

287
00:13:52,375 --> 00:13:54,625
and remember that hard work
will help you develop

288
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:56,416
into capable heroes.

289
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:58,583
Whether hero core,
support, business,

290
00:13:58,666 --> 00:14:00,000
or general studies.

291
00:14:00,083 --> 00:14:01,833
I don't want any
of you to forget

292
00:14:01,916 --> 00:14:05,208
that you're the one's who
will inherit our society.

293
00:14:05,291 --> 00:14:08,833
[VLAD KING] Well spoken.
Thank you, Principal Nezu.

294
00:14:08,916 --> 00:14:10,791
[NEZU] If you're looking
for a successor,

295
00:14:10,875 --> 00:14:12,458
there's no place
overflowing with more

296
00:14:12,541 --> 00:14:15,125
raw talent than UA High School.

297
00:14:15,208 --> 00:14:17,416
Think about coming
to teach for us.

298
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:19,791
Given your current state,
I'd recommend cutting back

299
00:14:19,875 --> 00:14:21,875
on the heroing, anyway.

300
00:14:21,958 --> 00:14:23,875
And trust me, I'm not
saying this without

301
00:14:23,958 --> 00:14:25,625
a few students in mind.

302
00:14:25,708 --> 00:14:28,333
I have no doubt that someone
worthy of your power

303
00:14:28,416 --> 00:14:30,958
walks the halls
of our fine school.

304
00:14:32,375 --> 00:14:34,208
[VLAD KING] Now, we'll hear
from the extra-curricular

305
00:14:34,291 --> 00:14:35,375
guidance teacher.

306
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:38,250
Please give Mr. Hound Dog
your attention.

307
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:41,791
[HOUND DOG]
Yesterday...

308
00:14:41,875 --> 00:14:44,083
[HOUND DOG growls]

309
00:14:44,166 --> 00:14:45,125
Two students-- 

310
00:14:45,208 --> 00:14:48,416
[snarls]

311
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:51,500
[howls]

312
00:14:52,083 --> 00:14:53,666
[VLAD KING]
All right.

313
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:56,666
As you just heard, there were
students fighting last night.

314
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:58,791
I know you're not used
to life in the dorms,

315
00:14:58,875 --> 00:15:02,291
but let's all be a little more
respectful moving forward.

316
00:15:02,375 --> 00:15:03,416
[KIRISHIMA, KAMINARI]
What was Mr. Hound Dog

317
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:04,791
even here for?

318
00:15:04,875 --> 00:15:07,750
Does he forget human speech
when he gets angry?

319
00:15:07,833 --> 00:15:11,208
There's still so much weird
stuff at UA I don't know about.

320
00:15:11,291 --> 00:15:13,333
Midoriya and Bakugo
were doing well,

321
00:15:13,416 --> 00:15:16,875
but now they're being treated
as problem children.

322
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:18,583
[VLAD KING] That's it.
Back to the classrooms

323
00:15:18,666 --> 00:15:20,458
starting with the third years.

324
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:23,041
[HADO] Hey, hey,
listen to what I heard!

325
00:15:23,125 --> 00:15:25,333
It was a couple of first-years
who were fighting.

326
00:15:25,416 --> 00:15:26,791
Two boys from Class 1-A.

327
00:15:26,875 --> 00:15:28,666
Isn't that a scoop?
Hey, do you know them?

328
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:30,041
They must get excited easily.

329
00:15:30,125 --> 00:15:31,375
Really?

330
00:15:35,208 --> 00:15:36,416
[AIZAWA]
Okay.

331
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,458
Starting today we'll
resume our regular classes

332
00:15:38,541 --> 00:15:40,458
and training schedule.

333
00:15:40,541 --> 00:15:43,500
I know a lot has happened
recently, however,

334
00:15:43,583 --> 00:15:46,875
you need to switch gears and
focus on your school duties.

335
00:15:46,958 --> 00:15:48,708
We're lecturing today,
but this semester

336
00:15:48,791 --> 00:15:51,375
you'll have even harsher
training than before.

337
00:15:51,458 --> 00:15:53,583
[ASHIDO]
He can't mean that, right?

338
00:15:53,666 --> 00:15:55,625
Like to share, Ashido?

339
00:15:55,708 --> 00:15:57,208
His icy stare is back!

340
00:15:57,291 --> 00:16:00,083
[TSUYU] Excuse me, sir.
May I ask a question?

341
00:16:00,166 --> 00:16:01,458
What were those
things the principal

342
00:16:01,541 --> 00:16:03,875
was talking about during
the opening ceremonies?

343
00:16:03,958 --> 00:16:06,708
I've never heard the term
hero work studies before.

344
00:16:06,791 --> 00:16:07,708
I know right?

345
00:16:07,791 --> 00:16:09,208
That had me pretty
confused, too.

346
00:16:09,291 --> 00:16:11,333
I also have concerns.

347
00:16:11,416 --> 00:16:12,500
He said they're something

348
00:16:12,583 --> 00:16:14,791
the upperclassmen
participate in, correct?

349
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,625
[AIZAWA] I was planning
to talk more about those

350
00:16:17,708 --> 00:16:22,875
at a later date, but I guess
telling you now is more logical.

351
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:26,250
To put it simply, it's
work outside of class.

352
00:16:26,333 --> 00:16:29,625
Like the internships you did
at pro hero agencies before.

353
00:16:29,708 --> 00:16:31,458
Only closer to the real thing.

354
00:16:31,541 --> 00:16:34,125
[OCHACO]
Huh. I never heard about these.

355
00:16:37,125 --> 00:16:38,625
Wait, then why did
we work so hard

356
00:16:38,708 --> 00:16:40,041
at the sports fest?!

357
00:16:40,125 --> 00:16:41,375
She has a point.

358
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:43,250
If we have work studies,
those who weren't scouted

359
00:16:43,333 --> 00:16:45,666
at the sports festival
still have career paths.

360
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:48,291
You gotta calm down.
You're acting kinda nutso.

361
00:16:48,375 --> 00:16:50,250
This doesn't make sense!

362
00:16:50,333 --> 00:16:51,541
You'll be using your connections

363
00:16:51,625 --> 00:16:53,625
from the festival to
secure a work study.

364
00:16:53,708 --> 00:16:55,500
It's basic networking.

365
00:16:55,583 --> 00:16:57,416
This isn't part of your
normal classwork.

366
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:00,375
It's discretionary
for each student.

367
00:17:00,458 --> 00:17:01,916
That means those
who weren't scouted

368
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,791
at the sports festival
will have a hard time

369
00:17:03,875 --> 00:17:05,541
lining one up I'm afraid.

370
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:08,708
Originally, individual agencies
recruited on their own.

371
00:17:08,791 --> 00:17:10,375
But there was lots of
competition as people

372
00:17:10,458 --> 00:17:12,500
tried to recruit UA students.

373
00:17:12,583 --> 00:17:14,916
So this is how things ended up.

374
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,333
Good enough, Ochaco?

375
00:17:16,416 --> 00:17:19,208
I'm sorry I jumped
to conclusions, sir.

376
00:17:20,416 --> 00:17:22,208
[AIZAWA] Now that you have
your provisional licenses,

377
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:26,125
you can assist in real ways,
for longer periods of time.

378
00:17:26,208 --> 00:17:27,958
Until now, there haven't
been many first years

379
00:17:28,041 --> 00:17:30,125
who've received their licenses.

380
00:17:30,208 --> 00:17:31,791
With the increased
activity of villains,

381
00:17:31,875 --> 00:17:33,708
we're currently exploring
the idea that you can

382
00:17:33,791 --> 00:17:36,208
participate in work
studies as well.

383
00:17:36,291 --> 00:17:38,333
We'll explain more about
the work study positions

384
00:17:38,416 --> 00:17:41,791
and what that program entails
at a later date, but for now...

385
00:17:41,875 --> 00:17:44,291
We've got other things
to worry about.

386
00:17:44,375 --> 00:17:48,166
That's all. Sorry to
keep you waiting, Mic.

387
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:50,291
[PRESENT MIC]
First period is English!

388
00:17:50,375 --> 00:17:52,250
In other words, it's jam time!

389
00:17:52,333 --> 00:17:54,000
Been an age since
I stood on this stage.

390
00:17:54,083 --> 00:17:55,625
Ya miss me?

391
00:17:55,708 --> 00:17:57,208
We've got a lot to cover today!

392
00:17:57,291 --> 00:17:59,458
Let's get rollin'
with it. Ya dig?

393
00:18:05,916 --> 00:18:08,541
Excuse me, but what is
with this dust, Bakugo?

394
00:18:08,625 --> 00:18:10,916
[KATSUKI] Deku was s'posed
to do that! Shut up!

395
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,125
Hey, can't you even clean
something right, you idiot?

396
00:18:13,208 --> 00:18:14,625
Right! Sorry!

397
00:18:14,708 --> 00:18:17,166
Man. I'm so beat.

398
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:18,916
[IZUKU] Hey, guys. If you put
your trash in the halls,

399
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,083
I'll take everything
down in a second.

400
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:23,583
[SATO]
So. Present Mic's class today.

401
00:18:23,666 --> 00:18:25,166
You as lost as I was?

402
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:27,166
Were we supposed to
know all the grammar

403
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:28,416
he was going over?

404
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,041
[ASHIDO]
Oh, yeah, that! Right?

405
00:18:30,125 --> 00:18:31,875
I was, like, is
this even English?

406
00:18:31,958 --> 00:18:33,625
[KIRISHIMA] I think I
studied the wrong chapters!

407
00:18:33,708 --> 00:18:35,083
[SATO] I got stuck at
the beginning and then

408
00:18:35,166 --> 00:18:37,666
I couldn't figure out
anything after that.

409
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:39,250
[JIRO]
About those work studies.

410
00:18:39,333 --> 00:18:42,416
I wasn't scouted, so I wonder if
I'll get to participate in one.

411
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:43,750
[HAGAKURE]
Maybe we can go to the places

412
00:18:43,833 --> 00:18:45,041
we did our internships.

413
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:47,083
I'd be totally down
with doing that.

414
00:18:47,166 --> 00:18:49,291
[OJIRO]
I hope I get to do one.

415
00:18:49,375 --> 00:18:50,541
[TENYA high-pitched]
In just one day,

416
00:18:50,625 --> 00:18:52,458
I've been completely
left behind!

417
00:18:52,541 --> 00:18:54,250
That's what you're thinking,
right, House Arrest?

418
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:57,166
Hey, don't call
me that, it's mean!

419
00:18:57,250 --> 00:18:59,500
Um, Iida. What's a work study?

420
00:18:59,583 --> 00:19:01,291
Something I can't
tell you about.

421
00:19:01,375 --> 00:19:02,875
The teachers have forbidden
us from giving you

422
00:19:02,958 --> 00:19:04,833
any details about our classes.

423
00:19:04,916 --> 00:19:06,833
Sorry, but you'll just have
to experience the same shock

424
00:19:06,916 --> 00:19:08,583
and surprise we went through.

425
00:19:08,666 --> 00:19:10,541
Did you catch that? Bakugo?

426
00:19:10,625 --> 00:19:13,583
Shut your mouth!
I heard you, four eyes.

427
00:19:14,916 --> 00:19:18,083
[IZUKU]
Aw, man. What is a work study?

428
00:19:18,166 --> 00:19:20,625
I'm clearly being left behind.

429
00:19:20,708 --> 00:19:22,666
I know it's just the
start of the semester,

430
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:24,041
but these three days
of house arrest

431
00:19:24,125 --> 00:19:25,833
are gonna hit me really hard.

432
00:19:25,916 --> 00:19:28,208
There's hero basic
training tomorrow!

433
00:19:28,291 --> 00:19:29,583
Everyone's gonna be
learning new stuff

434
00:19:29,666 --> 00:19:32,125
while I'm stuck hanging
out in my room.

435
00:19:32,208 --> 00:19:34,916
I hate this. I'm falling behind.

436
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,916
I can't slow down now.

437
00:19:40,583 --> 00:19:42,416
Ha! Trash, amiright?

[yelps]

439
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:44,500
What are you doing?

440
00:19:44,583 --> 00:19:45,583
You know you can just
throw away the food trays

441
00:19:45,666 --> 00:19:48,250
with the burnables, don't you?

442
00:19:48,333 --> 00:19:50,791
Uh. Yeah.

443
00:19:55,541 --> 00:19:58,958
[IZUKU] Am I going insane?
What was that?

444
00:19:59,041 --> 00:20:00,375
[IZUKU screams]

445
00:20:00,458 --> 00:20:02,166
So, you must be that excitable
first-year, aren't you?

446
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:04,666
Ha, ha! I bet that was a
freaky surprise for ya.

447
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:06,041
Kinda sorry about that!

448
00:20:06,125 --> 00:20:07,750
Gotta admit, I did pop up
here 'cause I thought

449
00:20:07,833 --> 00:20:08,625
you'd be shocked, though.

450
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:10,250
What in the world are you?

451
00:20:10,333 --> 00:20:13,250
[laughs] Not a bad question
there, my friend!

452
00:20:13,333 --> 00:20:15,875
I admit, sometimes I
even weird myself out!

453
00:20:15,958 --> 00:20:18,375
You know, once in a blue moon.

454
00:20:18,458 --> 00:20:19,833
But don't worry,
you're gonna find out

455
00:20:19,916 --> 00:20:21,375
who I am soon enough.

456
00:20:21,458 --> 00:20:23,666
I'm just glad it looks like
you've got a fighting spirit.

457
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:26,000
You see, the truth is that
people are talking about you,

458
00:20:26,083 --> 00:20:28,083
so I came to see what
the fuss was about.

459
00:20:32,541 --> 00:20:35,083
[IZUKU]
Okay. What just happened?

460
00:20:35,166 --> 00:20:38,000
I feel like I've seen
him somewhere before.

461
00:20:39,333 --> 00:20:41,750
[IZUKU] Despite it seeming
like time was crawling by,

462
00:20:41,833 --> 00:20:43,208
three days eventually passed,

463
00:20:43,291 --> 00:20:45,750
and I turned in
my written apology.

464
00:20:45,833 --> 00:20:49,375
My house arrest ended
the day before Kacchan's.

465
00:20:49,458 --> 00:20:51,041
I was back!

466
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:53,041
Guys! I'm sorry for all
the trouble I caused!

467
00:20:53,125 --> 00:20:55,166
No sweat, Deku. Thanks
for your hard work.

468
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:56,708
All he did was vacuum.

469
00:20:56,791 --> 00:20:58,750
And what's with
those steam nostrils?

470
00:20:58,833 --> 00:21:01,916
Class Rep! Iida! I'm sorry
I disappointed you!

471
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,208
Right.

472
00:21:03,291 --> 00:21:04,250
Well, I'm glad you learned
from your mistakes.

473
00:21:04,333 --> 00:21:06,041
Follow the rules from now on.

474
00:21:06,125 --> 00:21:08,083
I'll catch up with
everything I fell behind on

475
00:21:08,166 --> 00:21:09,458
these past three days!

476
00:21:09,541 --> 00:21:12,041
[KIRISHIMA] That's fightin'
the spirit! Do it, man!

477
00:21:12,125 --> 00:21:14,000
Time to take your
seats, everyone.

478
00:21:14,083 --> 00:21:15,083

[chairs scraping]

480
00:21:17,333 --> 00:21:19,583
[AIZAWA] Morning. Now
that Midoriya is back,

481
00:21:19,666 --> 00:21:23,666
we'll go into more detail about
what the work studies entail.

482
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:25,375
Go ahead and come in.

483
00:21:27,208 --> 00:21:28,916
[AIZAWA] I'll have people
who've experienced them

484
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:29,833
firsthand explain.

485
00:21:29,916 --> 00:21:31,416
[gasps]

486
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:33,583
[AIZAWA] I suggest you listen
carefully as they point out

487
00:21:33,666 --> 00:21:36,375
how work studies differ
from internships.

488
00:21:37,458 --> 00:21:38,916
[gasps]

489
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,291
[AIZAWA] These three
are third years at UA.

490
00:21:41,375 --> 00:21:44,166
They rank at the very
top of our student body.

491
00:21:45,833 --> 00:21:49,000
You may know them
as the Big Three.

492
00:21:52,416 --> 00:21:55,125
The Big Three. And it's him.

493
00:23:29,375 --> 00:23:30,708
[IZUKU]
Here's the preview!

494
00:23:30,791 --> 00:23:33,458
In work studies, we'll be able
to act like real heroes.

495
00:23:33,541 --> 00:23:35,083
The students teaching
us about the program

496
00:23:35,166 --> 00:23:37,958
are those who rank above
all other students at UA.

497
00:23:38,041 --> 00:23:40,125
The trio known as the Big Three.

498
00:23:40,208 --> 00:23:41,875
One of them is Mirio Togata,

499
00:23:41,958 --> 00:23:45,041
who suddenly offers to fight
everyone in my class!

500
00:23:45,125 --> 00:23:47,583
How will I fair against the
best students at school?

501
00:23:47,666 --> 00:23:49,500
Do any of us stand a chance?

502
00:23:49,583 --> 00:23:51,416
Next time: "Unrivaled"!

503
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:52,625
Wow, with that ability,

504
00:23:52,708 --> 00:23:55,083
he could totally become
the number-one hero!

505
00:23:55,166 --> 00:23:57,708
Go beyond! Plus Ultra!
