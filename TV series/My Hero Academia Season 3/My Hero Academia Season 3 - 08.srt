00:00:10,333 --> 00:00:12,958
[IZUKU] Welcome to UA High,
the prestigious school

2
00:00:13,041 --> 00:00:16,083
that's turned out some of
the world's greatest heroes.

3
00:00:16,166 --> 00:00:18,250
I'm running toward my
dream in these halls.

4
00:00:18,333 --> 00:00:20,333
Learning to overcome
obstacles and save people

5
00:00:20,416 --> 00:00:22,833
with a smile on my face.

6
00:00:22,916 --> 00:00:26,000
That's how I'll become the
greatest hero in the world!

7
00:02:00,833 --> 00:02:02,250
[IZUKU]
All Might told me there'd always

8
00:02:02,333 --> 00:02:04,416
be people beyond our reach.

9
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:08,250
That we can't protect
even though we want to.

10
00:02:08,333 --> 00:02:13,166
Which is why we have to save
the people we can reach.

11
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:17,166
I was so close to
being able to save him.

12
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:21,708
I needed to save him. Had to.

13
00:02:21,791 --> 00:02:24,625
That's the entire reason
I have my Quirk.

14
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:30,708
My body wouldn't move.

15
00:02:30,791 --> 00:02:34,916
I couldn't save someone
who was right in front of me.

16
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,041
And since I failed, he's gone.

17
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:41,166
All right, then
let's go get him.

18
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:43,208
We have to leave this
to the professionals!

19
00:02:43,291 --> 00:02:46,083
It's not the right time for
us to get involved. Idiots.

20
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:49,250
Maybe, but all I know
is that at camp,

21
00:02:49,333 --> 00:02:50,916
I couldn't do anything.

22
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,750
I heard my friend was targeted,

23
00:02:52,833 --> 00:02:55,750
and I just stood by. Helpless.

24
00:02:55,833 --> 00:02:57,958
So if I stand by
and do nothing now,

25
00:02:58,041 --> 00:03:01,250
how am I supposed to call
myself a hero or a man?

26
00:03:01,333 --> 00:03:04,833
C'mon. He's still
within your reach!

27
00:03:04,916 --> 00:03:07,625
We can save Bakugo!

28
00:03:13,875 --> 00:03:15,833
[ASHIDO]
So, let me get this straight.

29
00:03:15,916 --> 00:03:18,666
You're going to get Momo
to make you another receiver,

30
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:21,333
track a bad guy, and then
try to save Bakugo

31
00:03:21,416 --> 00:03:22,666
all by yourselves?

32
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:23,666
Yeah.

33
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:25,041
The villains who
attacked the camp

34
00:03:25,125 --> 00:03:26,666
planned to kill some of us.

35
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:29,000
But they took Bakugo alive.

36
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:30,333
What we don't know

37
00:03:30,416 --> 00:03:32,250
is how long they'll
let him live.

38
00:03:32,333 --> 00:03:35,458
That's why we're
going after him.

39
00:03:35,541 --> 00:03:38,166
[inahles] Have the two
of you lost your minds?

40
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:40,208
[SHOJI]
Hey. Calm down.

41
00:03:40,291 --> 00:03:43,000
I get how frustrated
Kirishima is.

42
00:03:43,083 --> 00:03:46,333
And how Todoroki feels since
he couldn't grab Bakugo.

43
00:03:46,416 --> 00:03:48,125
I'm upset, too.

44
00:03:48,208 --> 00:03:49,416
But...

45
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,833
We can't let our emotions
get the best of us.

46
00:03:51,916 --> 00:03:53,000
Right?

47
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:57,250
[AOYAMA] Um. We should just
leave this to All Might.

48
00:03:57,333 --> 00:03:59,583
Mr. Aizawa only gave
us permission to fight

49
00:03:59,666 --> 00:04:01,833
and use Quirks at
the training camp.

50
00:04:01,916 --> 00:04:03,833
Aoyama is correct.

51
00:04:03,916 --> 00:04:05,958
Though, I'm part of
the reason we failed.

52
00:04:06,041 --> 00:04:07,125
So, I can't talk.

53
00:04:07,208 --> 00:04:08,166
You guys!

54
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:09,500
[TSUYU]
Listen.

55
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:12,041
We're all shocked that
Bakugo was taken from us.

56
00:04:12,125 --> 00:04:14,125
But we have to be rational.

57
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:16,875
It doesn't matter how
noble your intentions.

58
00:04:16,958 --> 00:04:19,916
If you go out there trying
to find the bad guys,

59
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,916
knowing you're
breaking the rules,

60
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,250
then you're acting like
villains, not heroes.

61
00:04:37,666 --> 00:04:38,250
[knocking]

62
00:04:38,333 --> 00:04:39,125
[AOYAMA gasps]

63
00:04:39,208 --> 00:04:41,083
Sorry for interrupting you guys.

64
00:04:41,166 --> 00:04:44,000
But I need a moment
alone with Midoriya.

65
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:45,625
Sure. Let's bolt.

66
00:04:45,708 --> 00:04:48,250
I wanna see how Jiro
and Hagakure are doin'.

67
00:04:48,333 --> 00:04:49,791
Good idea.

68
00:04:49,875 --> 00:04:52,291
Yeah, okay. Feel better, Deku.

69
00:04:53,708 --> 00:04:55,583
Thank you for visiting me.

70
00:04:56,875 --> 00:04:59,291
[KIRISHIMA] We talked
to Yaoyorozu yesterday.

71
00:04:59,375 --> 00:05:02,500
If we're doing this,
it's tonight.

72
00:05:02,583 --> 00:05:05,125
Look, I know you've got
some pretty hardcore injuries.

73
00:05:05,208 --> 00:05:07,125
So, I don't know if you can go.

74
00:05:07,208 --> 00:05:08,208
But I wanted to invite you,

75
00:05:08,291 --> 00:05:10,666
since you probably
feel the worst.

76
00:05:11,875 --> 00:05:14,625
[KIRISHIMA] We'll meet in front
of the hospital after dark.

77
00:05:20,541 --> 00:05:21,750
[DOCTOR 46A]
Recovery Girl performed some

78
00:05:21,833 --> 00:05:23,250
pretty strong healing
on your arms

79
00:05:23,333 --> 00:05:25,166
while you were unconscious,
so you should be able

80
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:28,750
to move them around fairly well.

81
00:05:28,833 --> 00:05:31,000
But they were
seriously messed up.

82
00:05:31,083 --> 00:05:32,708
You've done absurd
damage to your body

83
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:34,333
in the last few months.

84
00:05:34,416 --> 00:05:38,166
And, frankly, this is a whole
new league of trauma.

85
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:41,458
[IZUKU] You mean... I was
hurt a lot worse this time?

86
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:43,500
I took a close look
at your charts.

87
00:05:43,583 --> 00:05:45,375
Your past injuries were bad.

88
00:05:45,458 --> 00:05:48,541
Splintered bones and ripped
muscles that were painful, sure,

89
00:05:48,625 --> 00:05:50,625
but could eventually
be repaired.

90
00:05:50,708 --> 00:05:53,791
This time, the damage
was devastating.

91
00:05:53,875 --> 00:05:56,166
Usually, a person's body
has limiters that keep it

92
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:58,500
from using more than
80 percent of its power

93
00:05:58,583 --> 00:06:00,708
at any given point.

94
00:06:00,791 --> 00:06:02,750
But in a crisis situation,

95
00:06:02,833 --> 00:06:04,916
it's possible for those
limiters to fall away,

96
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,750
allowing someone
to use 100 percent.

97
00:06:07,833 --> 00:06:10,208
We call it
"hysterical strength."

98
00:06:10,291 --> 00:06:11,666
The reason we
have those limiters

99
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:13,583
in the first place
is because our bodies

100
00:06:13,666 --> 00:06:16,250
can't handle that
type of strain.

101
00:06:16,333 --> 00:06:18,333
You had this
"hysterical strength."

102
00:06:18,416 --> 00:06:21,625
And because of that,
your power ended up overcharged

103
00:06:21,708 --> 00:06:24,250
for an extended period.

104
00:06:24,333 --> 00:06:26,166
It's bad for your bones and
muscles to get battered,

105
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:28,916
of course, but it's worse
for your ligaments.

106
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Ligaments protect the joints,

107
00:06:31,083 --> 00:06:33,208
and yours have
seriously degraded.

108
00:06:33,291 --> 00:06:36,583
In other words, if you
sustain this type of injury,

109
00:06:36,666 --> 00:06:39,875
even just two or
three more times,

110
00:06:39,958 --> 00:06:41,041
I don't think you're
going to be able

111
00:06:41,125 --> 00:06:44,166
to move your arms anymore.

112
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:47,291
For now, focus
on rehabilitation.

113
00:06:47,375 --> 00:06:49,416
Use them a lot,
even if it hurts,

114
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:52,291
and we'll leave the rest to UA.
I'll discharge you today,

115
00:06:52,375 --> 00:06:54,541
so you can go home
and take it easy.

116
00:06:54,625 --> 00:06:57,291
Take this seriously.

117
00:06:57,375 --> 00:07:00,333
Right. Thanks for
your help, Doctor.

118
00:07:00,416 --> 00:07:02,875
I'm sorry for any
trouble I caused.

fed up with you.

120

But, hey. I get the
impression that's nothin' new.

121
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:14,166
Also, don't forget
you did save someone.

I can move now, at least.

run down and sluggish, though,

even with all the healing
they performed on me.

138
00:08:07,666 --> 00:08:09,541
I heard it's because
UA wants a close eye

139
00:08:09,625 --> 00:08:11,750
on the students. Well, that,

00:09:40,916 --> 00:09:43,416
[KIRISHIMA]
I wonder what Yaoyorozu decided.

159
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,875
[TODOROKI] No matter how much
we wanna go after him,

160
00:09:45,958 --> 00:09:47,166
It's her choice.

161
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:48,416
She's here!

[BOTH gasp]

163

[TODOROKI]
Midoriya.

164
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:01,458
So, how 'bout it? You decide?

165
00:10:04,375 --> 00:10:05,083
I think that--

166
00:10:05,166 --> 00:10:05,833
Hold on!

167

[GROUP gasps]

168
00:10:09,166 --> 00:10:10,333
[KIRISHIMA]
Iida...

169
00:10:10,416 --> 00:10:12,250
Why are you here?

170
00:10:12,333 --> 00:10:17,208
[TENYA] You. Why did it have
to be you two of all people?

171
00:10:17,291 --> 00:10:19,916
The ones who stopped me
when I acted recklessly.

172
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Who received amnesty
with me after Hosu.

173
00:10:23,083 --> 00:10:24,375
Why are you trying
to make the same

174
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:28,500
stupid mistakes I made?
Didn't you learn?

175
00:10:28,583 --> 00:10:30,583
What are you talking about?

176
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,625
[TENYA]
We are still just students.

177
00:10:34,708 --> 00:10:37,208
And UA's in a bad
position as it is.

178
00:10:37,291 --> 00:10:40,000
Anything we do will
reflect on our school!

179
00:10:40,083 --> 00:10:41,000
Don't you get that?

180
00:10:41,083 --> 00:10:42,583
Iida. We have to.

181
00:10:42,666 --> 00:10:45,000
I know you don't like us
breaking rules, but--

182
00:10:48,833 --> 00:10:52,625
[TENYA] I'm frustrated, too!
And concerned. Obviously!

183
00:10:52,708 --> 00:10:54,708
I'm the class rep, dammit.

184
00:10:54,791 --> 00:10:59,250
I'm worried about all my
classmates. Not just Bakugo.

185
00:10:59,333 --> 00:11:01,166
When I saw your injuries,
all I could think of

186
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:03,833
was my brother in the hospital.

187
00:11:03,916 --> 00:11:05,458
What if your bodies
end up irreparable,

188
00:11:05,541 --> 00:11:09,916
just like his, because
I didn't step in.

189
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,416
Have you not stopped
to think about

190
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,291
where I'm coming from?

191
00:11:15,541 --> 00:11:19,166
[TENYA] Or are you saying
that you don't care how I feel?

192
00:11:21,375 --> 00:11:23,541
Of course I do.

193
00:11:23,625 --> 00:11:25,458
[TODOROKI]
Iida.

194
00:11:25,541 --> 00:11:26,833
You've got it wrong.

195
00:11:26,916 --> 00:11:30,791
We don't expect to face
them head-on and win.

196
00:11:30,875 --> 00:11:32,958
We'll get him back
without fighting.

197
00:11:33,041 --> 00:11:34,708
Yeah, we'll be stealthy.

198
00:11:34,791 --> 00:11:36,708
I'm talkin' covert ops here.

199
00:11:36,791 --> 00:11:39,791
We can rescue him without
breaking the rules.

200
00:11:39,875 --> 00:11:42,416
[YAOYOROZU] I trust in
Todoroki's judgment, but...

201
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,958
Still. Things could
always go wrong.

202
00:11:45,041 --> 00:11:47,208
So I'll join you as backup.

203
00:11:47,291 --> 00:11:49,541
I'll stand behind my classmates.

204
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:50,875
You can't be serious!

205
00:11:50,958 --> 00:11:53,166
You're the best.

206
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:54,750
[IZUKU]
I know I'm hurt.

207
00:11:54,833 --> 00:11:59,583
But if I can still move at all,
then I can't just sit still.

208
00:11:59,666 --> 00:12:03,500
I have to reach out
and do something.

209
00:12:03,583 --> 00:12:06,291
'Cause all I can think
about is saving him.

210
00:12:08,125 --> 00:12:10,208
[ALL MIGHT] There are
stories about every hero.

211
00:12:10,291 --> 00:12:14,958
How they became great.
Most have one thing in common.

212
00:12:15,041 --> 00:12:18,208
Their bodies moved before
they had a chance to think.

213
00:12:18,291 --> 00:12:20,250
Almost on their own.

214
00:12:21,541 --> 00:12:24,708
We'll never agree.

215
00:12:24,791 --> 00:12:26,416
So I'm going to come with you.

216
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:28,750
[GROUP gasps]

217
00:12:28,833 --> 00:12:31,333
[IZUKU]
After the USJ and Hosu attacks,

218
00:12:31,416 --> 00:12:36,125
we thought we'd seen true evil.
That the worst was over.

219
00:12:36,208 --> 00:12:39,750
We've gathered some of our
finest heroes here today.

220
00:12:39,833 --> 00:12:42,666
Now. Let's talk strategy.

221
00:12:46,083 --> 00:12:49,750
[SHIGARAKI] I'll ask you one
more time, Katsuki Bakugo.

222
00:12:49,833 --> 00:12:55,958
Aspiring hero. Will you join
the League of Villains?

223
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:59,375
Go throw yourself into traffic.

224
00:12:59,458 --> 00:13:03,500
[IZUKU] But something far
worse was about to begin.

225
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:18,958
[TENYA]
Midoriya.

226
00:13:20,041 --> 00:13:22,250
I shouldn't have
hit you back there.

227
00:13:22,333 --> 00:13:24,541
I'm sorry. Forgive me.

228
00:13:24,625 --> 00:13:26,708
I have some concerns, Iida.

229
00:13:26,791 --> 00:13:28,333
What exactly is
your justification

230
00:13:28,416 --> 00:13:29,958
for changing your mind
and joining us?

231
00:13:30,041 --> 00:13:33,166
Hey, it's fine, you don't
need to apologize.

232
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:34,500
[TENYA]
To be clear,

233
00:13:34,583 --> 00:13:36,541
I'm coming because I don't
condone your behavior.

234
00:13:36,625 --> 00:13:38,000
It's a simple as that.

235
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:39,958
If there's even a hint
that physical combat

236
00:13:40,041 --> 00:13:43,208
might break out, I'll make
you retreat immediately.

237
00:13:43,291 --> 00:13:44,666
So in other words...

238
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:45,916
I'm your watchman!

239
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,166
Exactly what we needed.

240
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:49,791
The same goes for me.

241
00:13:49,875 --> 00:13:52,458
Rescuing Bakugo is a
job for the pros.

242
00:13:52,541 --> 00:13:53,791
Objectively speaking,

243
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:56,583
there's no reason for
any of us to go after him.

244
00:13:56,666 --> 00:13:58,083
However,

245
00:13:58,166 --> 00:14:01,166
I understand how each of you
feels, so I'm compromising.

246
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:02,416
Don't forget that.

247
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:03,166
Right.

248
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:04,791
Understood.

249
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:08,625
[YAOYOROZU]
A rescue without us fighting...

250
00:14:08,708 --> 00:14:10,875
It's not plausible.

251
00:14:10,958 --> 00:14:12,958
The others are so
driven by frustration

252
00:14:13,041 --> 00:14:14,666
that they're blinded. But...

253
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:17,041
Once they see the situation
first-hand and realize

254
00:14:17,125 --> 00:14:19,666
how difficult it will be,
they should understand

255
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:22,291
their plan is
completely unrealistic.

256
00:14:25,208 --> 00:14:27,250
[YAOYOROZU] The coordinates
indicate Camino Ward,

257

Yokohama City in
Kanagawa Prefecture.

258
00:14:30,083 --> 00:14:33,041
Our travel time will be about
two hours from here.

We should arrive around
ten o'clock tonight.

260
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:36,500
So, um.

261
00:14:36,583 --> 00:14:38,041
Did you tell the rest
of the class about this?

262
00:14:38,125 --> 00:14:39,791
Do they know what
we're doing tonight?

263
00:14:39,875 --> 00:14:41,125
[TODOROKI]
Yes.

264
00:14:41,208 --> 00:14:42,958
And they tried their best
to talk us out of it.

265
00:14:43,041 --> 00:14:44,916
Yeah, even Uraraka
ganged up on us

266
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,916
and tried to get us
to change our minds.

267
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,666
I just don't know, you guys.

268
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:50,458
Think about what
Bakugo would want.

269
00:14:50,541 --> 00:14:53,166
We'd just make everything
worse I'm afraid.

270
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:55,041
[KIRISHIMA]
Anyway...

Stay back, Deku!

273
00:15:01,916 --> 00:15:03,416
Just to make sure.

274
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:05,625
You know we're going
against everyone's wishes,

275
00:15:05,708 --> 00:15:08,458
and being completely
selfish by doing this.

276
00:15:08,541 --> 00:15:10,208
We can call this off
if we want to.

277
00:15:10,291 --> 00:15:12,333
Does it look like
I wanna turn back?

278
00:15:12,416 --> 00:15:13,916
Bakugo wouldn't
think twice about

279
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,375
going after the villains
if he were here.

280
00:15:16,458 --> 00:15:19,250
What about you, Midoriya?

281
00:15:19,333 --> 00:15:20,791
He's my friend.

282
00:15:20,875 --> 00:15:23,083
[ALL MIGHT] Meddling where you
don't technically have to

283
00:15:23,166 --> 00:15:26,875
is the essence of being a hero.

284
00:15:26,958 --> 00:15:31,583
[IZUKU] Mom. All Might
gave me everything.

285
00:15:31,666 --> 00:15:36,000
He trusted that I'd make
the most of his Quirk.

286
00:15:36,083 --> 00:15:38,208
I refuse to turn back.

287
00:15:41,541 --> 00:15:44,083
I see. All right, then.

288
00:15:50,208 --> 00:15:52,291
[IZUKU]
So this is Camino Ward.

[TODOROKI]
It's so crowded.

290
00:15:53,958 --> 00:15:56,375
[KIRISHIMA] Those Villains are
hiding somewhere in this city.

291
00:15:56,458 --> 00:15:57,791
Just tell me where to go!

292
00:15:57,875 --> 00:15:59,250
Wait a second!

293
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:00,416
From now on,

294
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,750
we going to need to be
extremely careful.

295
00:16:02,833 --> 00:16:05,750
These criminals already know
what we look like, remember?

296
00:16:05,833 --> 00:16:06,791
We have to consider that

297
00:16:06,875 --> 00:16:08,625
we could be attacked
at any moment.

298

Yeah, you're right!
Stealth mode.

299

You're standing out
even more, Midoriya.

300
00:16:13,625 --> 00:16:15,250
We won't be able to
scout effectively

301
00:16:15,333 --> 00:16:16,541
if we're recognizable.

302
00:16:16,625 --> 00:16:18,333
'Kay, so what should we do?

303
00:16:18,416 --> 00:16:19,416
I have an idea.

304
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,458
Though it is a bit old school.

00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:29,375
Yo, fool. What chu lookin' at?

306
00:16:32,041 --> 00:16:34,541
This is me, incognito.

307
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:39,333
Now we'll blend in perfectly.

308
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,083
I feel so ridiculous.

309
00:16:46,666 --> 00:16:48,833
I dunno, I kinda dig it.

We are here to apologize.

I'll take the first question.

Since the beginning of the year,

UA students have had four
encounters with villains.

This time, there were students
who were gravely injured.
