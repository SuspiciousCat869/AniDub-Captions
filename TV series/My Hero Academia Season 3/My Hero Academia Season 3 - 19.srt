[IZUKU] Welcome to UA High,
the prestigious school

2
00:00:13,125 --> 00:00:16,125
that's turned out some of
the world's greatest heroes.

3
00:00:16,208 --> 00:00:18,291
I'm running toward my
dream in these halls.

4
00:00:18,375 --> 00:00:20,458
Learning to overcome
obstacles and save people

5
00:00:20,541 --> 00:00:22,875
with a smile on my face.

6
00:00:22,958 --> 00:00:25,916
That's how I'll become the
greatest hero in the world!

7
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:02,166
[IZUKU] The provisional
licensing exam is upon us.

8
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:06,458
[MERA]
Oh, right.

9
00:02:06,541 --> 00:02:08,541
For the 100 of you who
passed the first test,

10
00:02:08,625 --> 00:02:11,833
please turn your
attention to the screen.

11
00:02:11,916 --> 00:02:13,125
It's the test arena.

12
00:02:13,208 --> 00:02:15,000
What's happens next?

13
00:02:23,958 --> 00:02:25,458
[STUDENTS]
Why?

14
00:02:25,541 --> 00:02:27,958
Wait. Does that mean...?

15
00:02:28,041 --> 00:02:30,750
[MERA] There's only one
more round to the exam.

16
00:02:30,833 --> 00:02:33,291
Your goal is simple:
undertake rescue exercises

17
00:02:33,375 --> 00:02:35,166
and save the bystanders
who are trapped

18
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:37,375
in these disaster sites.

19
00:02:38,791 --> 00:02:40,208
[BOTH]
Save the what now?

20
00:02:40,291 --> 00:02:41,416
[HAGAKURE]
Bystanders.

21
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,166
We learned about them
in class, remember?

22
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:45,166
They're people at
a disaster scene.

23
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:47,625
It can also simply refer
to innocent citizens

24
00:02:47,708 --> 00:02:49,208
on the street.

25
00:02:49,291 --> 00:02:51,666
[MERA] Use this time to show
us how you will carry out

26
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:54,333
successful rescue
procedures once you receive

27
00:02:54,416 --> 00:02:56,125
your provisional licenses.

28
00:02:56,208 --> 00:02:58,875
Treat this as though
it were the real thing.

29
00:03:02,291 --> 00:03:05,500
[sighs] Rescuing.

30
00:03:05,583 --> 00:03:07,625
On the screen.

31
00:03:07,708 --> 00:03:10,375
[gasps] Little kids
and old people?

32
00:03:10,458 --> 00:03:12,750
[MINETA] That's so dangerous--
why're they here?

33
00:03:12,833 --> 00:03:15,166
[MERA] These specialists have
been trained as professional

34
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:18,833
"persons in need of rescue."
They're very popular.

35
00:03:18,916 --> 00:03:21,208
Introducing the
"Help Us Company,"

36
00:03:21,291 --> 00:03:23,625
also known as HUC for short.

37
00:03:23,708 --> 00:03:25,500
So, they're basically
actors, I guess?

38
00:03:25,583 --> 00:03:27,375
It's the kind of job
you never think about.

39
00:03:27,458 --> 00:03:29,083
But a necessary one
in our world,

40
00:03:29,166 --> 00:03:31,416
since they support
our hero training.

41
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,041
[MERA] The HUC bystanders
have dressed up

42
00:03:33,125 --> 00:03:35,000
like injured victims
and will be located

43
00:03:35,083 --> 00:03:36,958
throughout the disaster site.

44
00:03:37,041 --> 00:03:38,916
We'll be judging how well
you keep them safe

45
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,916
as you go about your mission.

46
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,458
Oh, by the way.

47
00:03:42,541 --> 00:03:44,791
We'll be scoring you
on a point system.

48
00:03:44,875 --> 00:03:46,541
If you have more points
than the benchmark

49
00:03:46,625 --> 00:03:48,958
at the time the exercise
comes to an end,

50
00:03:49,041 --> 00:03:50,875
then you pass the exam.

51
00:03:50,958 --> 00:03:52,625
We'll start in ten minutes.

52
00:03:52,708 --> 00:03:56,416
Take care of any necessary
preparations now.

53
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,750
This looks familiar.

54
00:03:58,833 --> 00:04:00,875
It's like Kamino Ward.

55
00:04:00,958 --> 00:04:03,541
I wonder if they
based it off that.

56
00:04:03,625 --> 00:04:06,375
[TENYA] It's true that
the situations are similar.

57
00:04:06,458 --> 00:04:07,833
But our only goal then

58
00:04:07,916 --> 00:04:10,166
was to rescue Bakugo
from the villains.

59
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:13,291
We let the pros handle
search and recovery.

60
00:04:13,375 --> 00:04:17,541
And you'll recall,
there were many casualties.

61
00:04:17,625 --> 00:04:19,083
Not this time.

62
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:26,375
[SERO] Guys. You gotta
listen to this story.

63
00:04:26,458 --> 00:04:27,583
It's pretty juicy.

64
00:04:27,666 --> 00:04:28,583
What's the rating?

65
00:04:28,666 --> 00:04:30,041
Triple X.

66
00:04:30,125 --> 00:04:31,666
Go on.

67
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:33,708
[SERO] That fox in the
bodysuit from Shiketsu.

68
00:04:33,791 --> 00:04:35,041
--The one over there.
--[KAMINARI] Yeah?

69
00:04:35,125 --> 00:04:37,416
If you're just gonna say
she's hot, that's obvious.

70
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:40,083
I've had my eyes on her since
the moment we crossed paths.

71
00:04:40,166 --> 00:04:41,291
Well, get this.

72
00:04:41,375 --> 00:04:43,166
I saw her hiding in the
rocks with Midoriya,

73
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:44,208
buck naked.

74
00:04:44,291 --> 00:04:46,375
[BOTH]
Midoriya!

75
00:04:46,458 --> 00:04:47,750
What were you doing
while the rest of us

76
00:04:47,833 --> 00:04:49,708
were just trying to
stay alive, you bastard?!

77
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:52,000
Was this entire test
nothing but a joke for you?

78
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:54,250
Guys, cool it! What's going on?

79
00:04:54,333 --> 00:04:55,750
Don't play stupid with us!

80
00:04:55,833 --> 00:04:59,041
What devious things were you
doing with that uber hottie?

81
00:05:02,208 --> 00:05:03,583
[giggles]

82
00:05:03,666 --> 00:05:06,208
[MINETA shrieks] The casual
greeting exchanged between

83
00:05:06,291 --> 00:05:07,958
a man and woman whose
sexual relationship

84
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:09,625
has advanced several bases!

85
00:05:09,708 --> 00:05:12,375
Just how Plus Ultra did you
end up going with her?

86
00:05:12,458 --> 00:05:15,416
Uh-- Now I get it. Sero talked.

87
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:17,791
Listen, guys. Whatever
he told you is wrong.

88
00:05:17,875 --> 00:05:19,500
It was a side effect
of her Quirk.

89
00:05:19,583 --> 00:05:21,416
Actually, I had no idea
what was happening

90
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:22,666
and almost failed the test.

91
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:24,041

But you did see her naked?

92
00:05:24,125 --> 00:05:25,125
Well, sorta.

Don't you lie to us!

94

[KAMINARI]
Why is she still waving at you?

95
00:05:29,375 --> 00:05:31,666
[MINETA] Give us details,
Midoriya, I beg you.

96
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:34,125
[IZUKU] I told you,
nothing weird went down!

97
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:35,875
Oh, hey, it's Shiketsu.

[MORA]
Bakugo.

[KATSUKI]
What?

100
00:05:41,041 --> 00:05:42,791
[MORA] I think you met
Shishikura in the test.

101
00:05:42,875 --> 00:05:45,333
My classmate with the
flesh-molding power?

[KIRISHIMA]
So much hair.

103
00:05:48,208 --> 00:05:49,791
Yeah. I took him out.

104
00:05:49,875 --> 00:05:50,500
[MORA]
I thought so.

105

[gasps]

106
00:05:51,833 --> 00:05:53,208
[MORA] I'm guessing he
may have acted rudely,

107
00:05:53,291 --> 00:05:55,083
or perhaps offended you.

108
00:05:55,166 --> 00:05:56,666
He has a tendency
to try and push

109
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:59,541
his own values onto others.

110
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:01,541
He probably couldn't
help it in your case,

111
00:06:01,625 --> 00:06:05,250
since you're pretty famous.
I apologize for him.

112
00:06:05,333 --> 00:06:06,833
I'd like to build
a good relationship

113
00:06:06,916 --> 00:06:08,375
between our schools.

114
00:06:08,458 --> 00:06:10,250
I-I guess he wants
to be friends?

115
00:06:10,333 --> 00:06:11,708
So he says.

116
00:06:11,791 --> 00:06:15,458
But the way they were fighting,
it didn't seem that way.

"A good relationship."

Anyway. That's it.

Hey. You with the collar.

Huh?

Oh, no, I'm sorry.
Did I hurt your feelings?

You've changed a little bit

since the first time
our paths crossed.

You realize you're
sitting in the stands

317
00:14:17,041 --> 00:14:20,000
because you're the one who
failed. Right, Shishikura?

Yes, I am aware.

Just checking.

You should use this as a chance
to analyze what went wrong.

321

00:14:29,666 --> 00:14:30,666
[SHIKETSU TEACHER 57A]
Seems to me you've taken

[SHIKETSU TEACHER 57A]
No, it's not.

Listen, what he taught
wasn't necessarily all bad.

Between Stain's
fundamentalist ideas

329

and All Might's retirement,

330
00:14:44,666 --> 00:14:46,416
there are many who wish
to reform the role

that heroes play in society.
That's just fine.

332

But if negativity
and hate take over,

like they did for you during
the first round of the exam,

334
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:57,041
they can impair your judgment

and keep you from

Look at the way the walls

Right now, the structure
is balanced precariously,

like an intricate puzzle.

00:15:33,791 --> 00:15:35,375
Everything will topple
if we're careless

with our movements.

354

We have to do
this strategically.

Now I see. You're right.

356
00:15:40,416 --> 00:15:41,708
[YAOYOROZU]
First, let's use a support beam

357

to prop up this wall.

358

It'll take some time to get
everything into place though.

[SERO] No worries.
You can leave that to us!

00:16:05,875 --> 00:16:07,375
[HUC ELDERLY MAN 57A]
It's not perfect,

366
00:16:07,458 --> 00:16:10,083
but it's not a
horrible plan, either.

367
00:16:10,166 --> 00:16:11,916
[HUC ELDERLY MAN 57A] When
there's a large-scale disaster,

368
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,208
there are never enough rescuers
to help those in need of saving.

369
00:16:15,291 --> 00:16:17,083
That means the work
should be as fast

370
00:16:17,166 --> 00:16:18,791
and efficient as possible.

371
00:16:18,875 --> 00:16:21,250
If someone tries to do
everything themselves,

372
00:16:21,333 --> 00:16:23,208
they'll lose time
in the long run.

373
00:16:23,291 --> 00:16:25,333
What's important is
being realistic about

374
00:16:25,416 --> 00:16:27,875
what your own Quirk
can and can't do,

375
00:16:27,958 --> 00:16:30,166
and then figuring out how
you can divide the labor

376
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:31,875
with the other heroes.

377
00:16:31,958 --> 00:16:34,208
Focusing on your role
during a test where you're

378
00:16:34,291 --> 00:16:36,500
trying to stand out
takes courage.

379
00:16:36,583 --> 00:16:38,083
It's something you can only do

380
00:16:38,166 --> 00:16:41,208
if you really understand
the situation.

381
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:44,416
But there is still a lot
of wasted effort here.

382
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,000
If they keep going like this,

went off on their own.

Unlike in the first round,

00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:58,541
we may need to split up
for this one.

We could move in smaller groups.

471
00:19:45,541 --> 00:19:47,250
[GANG ORCA] In the short
time until emergency

472
00:19:47,333 --> 00:19:50,833
responders arrive,
heroes must act alone.

473
00:19:50,916 --> 00:19:53,833
Helping the victims
and performing first aid.

474
00:19:53,916 --> 00:19:55,791
Once the professionals show up,

475
00:19:55,875 --> 00:19:58,708
the transition
should be seamless.

476
00:19:58,791 --> 00:19:59,750
How goes it?

477
00:19:59,833 --> 00:20:01,333
[MERA]
Let's see.

478
00:20:01,416 --> 00:20:03,875
During their initial response,
there was some poor judgement.

479
00:20:03,958 --> 00:20:05,791
But the points taken off
by HUC members

480
00:20:05,875 --> 00:20:07,416
are still pretty minimal.

481
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:10,000
The students are doing
better than expected.

482
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:12,750
Less incompetence than
usual, I would say.

483
00:20:14,333 --> 00:20:15,500
[GANG ORCA]
Wonderful.

484
00:20:15,583 --> 00:20:17,916
But in order to protect
citizens in need,

485
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,416
heroes must multitask.

486
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:24,666
They can't just rescue.
They must adapt.

487
00:20:26,916 --> 00:20:28,666
[gasps] What happened?

488
00:20:30,166 --> 00:20:31,458
[KIRISHIMA yelps]

489
00:20:31,541 --> 00:20:32,625
--[KIRISHIMA] Whoa!
--[KAMINARI] We're gonna die!

490
00:20:32,708 --> 00:20:33,791
Explosions?

491
00:20:33,875 --> 00:20:35,125
[HAGAKURE]
What?

492
00:20:35,208 --> 00:20:38,000
[OCHACO]
Wait. Could this be...

493
00:20:38,083 --> 00:20:41,000
[MERA] A villain has completed
another large-scale attack.

494
00:20:41,083 --> 00:20:43,250
Everyone! This is
part of the exam.

495
00:20:43,333 --> 00:20:44,250
You think so?

496
00:20:44,333 --> 00:20:45,333
That means...

497
00:20:45,416 --> 00:20:46,625
[EXAMINEE 57E]
Hey, look!

498
00:20:46,708 --> 00:20:48,666
[IZUKU gasps]

499
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:51,583
[GANG ORCA]
Tell me, wannabe heroes.

500
00:20:51,666 --> 00:20:55,583
Can you rescue people
and fight at the same time?

501
00:20:56,833 --> 00:20:59,458
That's Gang Orca!

502
00:20:59,541 --> 00:21:01,083
[MERA] During the
search-and-destroy mission

503
00:21:01,166 --> 00:21:02,958
against the League of Villains,

504
00:21:03,041 --> 00:21:07,208
Gang Orca fought alongside
Endeavor and Best Jeanist.

505
00:21:08,291 --> 00:21:11,541
[MERA] He's a strong pro,
currently ranked number ten.

506
00:21:11,625 --> 00:21:14,916
Impressive. He's also ranked
third in the list of heroes

507
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,583
who look as though
they should be villains.

508
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:21,458
[MERA]
The terrorists have appeared

509
00:21:21,541 --> 00:21:23,625
and are beginning
to sweep the area.

510
00:21:23,708 --> 00:21:25,583
Hero candidates at the
scene should continue

511
00:21:25,666 --> 00:21:27,625
their rescue efforts
while also suppressing

512
00:21:27,708 --> 00:21:29,625
the newly-arrived villains.

513
00:21:29,708 --> 00:21:31,791
[TENYA] We're gonna have
to save people and battle?

514
00:21:31,875 --> 00:21:32,833
Are they serious?!

515
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:34,166
Jeez! Come on!

516
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:36,875
Aren't they expecting
too much from us?

517
00:21:36,958 --> 00:21:39,666
Even for a pro,
this would be difficult.

518
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:42,041
They're going a
little far I'd say.

519
00:21:43,708 --> 00:21:47,625
[GANG ORCA]
Now. How will you react?

520
00:21:47,708 --> 00:21:50,208
Will you fight or protect?

521
00:21:50,291 --> 00:21:53,541
Help or run away?

522
00:21:53,625 --> 00:21:55,708
What would a hero do?

523
00:23:29,291 --> 00:23:31,416
