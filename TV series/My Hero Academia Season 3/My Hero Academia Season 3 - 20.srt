Boo! I am here.

00:00:11,291 --> 00:00:14,291
In a flashy yellow shirt
that matches Young Midoriya's!

3
00:00:14,375 --> 00:00:15,625
Ta-dah!

00:00:15,708 --> 00:00:17,833
All Might, this isn't
where I'm supposed to be!

5
00:00:17,916 --> 00:00:19,833
Me and the rest of Class 1-A
are in the middle of our

6
00:00:19,916 --> 00:00:21,833
provisional hero licensing exam!

7
00:00:21,916 --> 00:00:23,083
It's important!

8
00:00:23,166 --> 00:00:24,333
[ALL MIGHT]
I know!

9
00:00:24,416 --> 00:00:26,750
And I can't wait to find
out what happens next.

10
00:00:26,833 --> 00:00:27,583
But, kid...

11
00:00:27,666 --> 00:00:29,000
Just ignore that for now!

12
00:00:29,083 --> 00:00:30,041
Why?

13
00:00:30,125 --> 00:00:31,208
Here's a Q.

14
00:00:31,291 --> 00:00:33,125
Do you know the best
way to save people?

15
00:00:33,208 --> 00:00:33,958
With love!

16
00:00:34,041 --> 00:00:35,291
I don't understand.

17
00:00:35,375 --> 00:00:37,000
You gotta learn to let loose.

18
00:00:37,083 --> 00:00:39,791
You're working hard, but you
should have fun when you can!

19
00:00:39,875 --> 00:00:42,666
So let's go beyond your
existing story arc!

20
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:44,833
[BOTH]
Plus Ultra!

21
00:00:44,916 --> 00:00:47,958
Hope you enjoy this super
special side episode.

22
00:00:48,041 --> 00:00:51,000
I take a daring new turn in
"Save the World with Love!"

23
00:00:51,083 --> 00:00:54,500
Now, cue those
opening credits! Go!

24
00:02:28,125 --> 00:02:30,250
[ALL MIGHT coughs]
Morning.

25
00:02:30,333 --> 00:02:31,625
Perfect timing.

26
00:02:31,708 --> 00:02:33,291
You're on TV right now.

27
00:02:33,375 --> 00:02:35,500
Some kind of retrospective.

28
00:02:35,583 --> 00:02:37,333
About me?

29
00:02:37,416 --> 00:02:39,375
[TV NARRATOR 58A]
So, just how did All Might,

30
00:02:39,458 --> 00:02:40,541
the Symbol of Peace,

31
00:02:40,625 --> 00:02:42,833
become the number-one
hero in the world?

32
00:02:42,916 --> 00:02:44,500
Let's take a look
back on his time

33
00:02:44,583 --> 00:02:46,250
studying abroad in America.

34
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:48,666
You're safe because I am here.

35
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:50,125
[ALL MIGHT]
That takes me back.

36
00:02:50,208 --> 00:02:51,375
[MIDNIGHT]
How many decades?

37
00:02:51,458 --> 00:02:53,166
[ALL MIGHT coughs]

38
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:55,458
[MIDNIGHT] Real subtle way
of sidestepping the question.

39
00:02:55,541 --> 00:02:56,833
I know that costume.

40
00:02:56,916 --> 00:02:59,333
It's from your Young Age!

41
00:02:59,416 --> 00:03:01,083
Heh. Yep.

42
00:03:01,166 --> 00:03:02,291
Well spotted.

43
00:03:02,375 --> 00:03:03,875
Oh, well, thanks.

44
00:03:03,958 --> 00:03:07,375
I've been a fan of All Might's
since I was just a little kid.

45
00:03:07,458 --> 00:03:10,458
Well, aren't you an inspiration.

46
00:03:10,541 --> 00:03:12,291
No, not at all!

47
00:03:12,375 --> 00:03:14,333
[MIDNIGHT]
Could he look more smug?

48
00:03:14,416 --> 00:03:15,666
[TV NARRATOR 58A]
All Might wasn't acting

49
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:18,250
alone while abroad. The
sidekick who supported him

50
00:03:18,333 --> 00:03:20,500
was none other than
a young David Shield.

51
00:03:20,583 --> 00:03:22,916
[MIDNIGHT] Wait, does he
mean <i>that</i> David Shield?

52
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,041
[CEMENTOSS] Birds of
a feather, and all that.

53
00:03:25,125 --> 00:03:28,166
It's no surprise such
elites found each other.

54
00:03:29,333 --> 00:03:33,458
[ALL MIGHT] Dave. It's been
far too long, my friend.

[COMPUTER] An email is here!
An email is here!

56
00:03:37,166 --> 00:03:39,208
[AIZAWA] It's about time
to begin the special class.

57
00:03:39,291 --> 00:03:41,208
I have a few notes
about my costume.

58
00:03:41,291 --> 00:03:43,666
Not to worry.
Everything is ready.

59
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:45,416
[ALL MIGHT]
Let's teach those wannabe pros

60
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,291
a thing or two about hero-ing.

61
00:03:52,083 --> 00:03:54,291
[IZUKU] UA High holds special
classes for those wanting

62
00:03:54,375 --> 00:03:56,208
to train during summer vacation.

63
00:03:56,291 --> 00:03:57,875
Today's the first
one this break,

64
00:03:57,958 --> 00:04:00,666
and we have no idea
what's in store.

65
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:02,708
We'll be running this
course multiple times

66
00:04:02,791 --> 00:04:04,958
with small groups
from your class.

67
00:04:05,041 --> 00:04:07,125
Today it will be the six of you.

68
00:04:07,208 --> 00:04:08,833
Just so you know,
this will be harder

69
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:11,666
than a regular class.
Prepare yourselves.

70
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:13,625
[TSUYU] I wonder what
they'll have us do.

71
00:04:13,708 --> 00:04:15,458
[IZUKU] Is this gonna be one
of those times he threatens

72
00:04:15,541 --> 00:04:17,583
to expel us if we fail?

73
00:04:17,666 --> 00:04:19,375
[AIZAWA] In this master
class, you'll be tasked

74
00:04:19,458 --> 00:04:21,500
with saving innocent bystanders.

75
00:04:21,583 --> 00:04:23,250
And capturing a villain.

76
00:04:23,333 --> 00:04:24,666
Huh?

77
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:27,583
[BOTH] We're not just studying--
we're playing heroes!

78
00:04:29,708 --> 00:04:31,333
[AIZAWA]
This should be obvious.

79
00:04:31,416 --> 00:04:34,541
But villains commit many
different types of crime.

80
00:04:34,625 --> 00:04:36,625
You six will be
dispatched to a scene

81
00:04:36,708 --> 00:04:39,083
and will need to determine
what happened there.

82
00:04:39,166 --> 00:04:41,583
Whether or not a villain
was actually at fault.

83
00:04:41,666 --> 00:04:43,708
Whether or not you should fight.

84
00:04:43,791 --> 00:04:46,500
We will be judging your ability
to assess the situation

85
00:04:46,583 --> 00:04:49,250
as well as how well
you diffuse it.

86
00:04:49,333 --> 00:04:51,708
Welcome your instructors.

87
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:54,791
I am here, sneaking in
through the back door!

00:04:54,875 --> 00:04:56,291

89
00:04:56,375 --> 00:04:59,000
ou're looking extra
muscly today! Yowza!

90
00:04:59,083 --> 00:05:01,375
[laughs]

91
00:05:01,458 --> 00:05:03,291
He's not the only one today.

92
00:05:03,375 --> 00:05:06,916
Cementoss, Midnight, and
Present Mic will be assisting.

93
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,375
They'll be acting
as special trainers.

94
00:05:10,541 --> 00:05:11,875
[AIZAWA]
Let's get started.

95
00:05:11,958 --> 00:05:14,208
Head to Ground Beta
and we'll begin.

96
00:05:17,291 --> 00:05:19,750
I see cardboard police cutouts.

97
00:05:19,833 --> 00:05:22,333
This must be where the
crime is taking place.

98
00:05:22,416 --> 00:05:24,916
[AIZAWA]
I'll brief you on the situation.

99
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,625
There's been an attack
in this jewelry store.

100
00:05:27,708 --> 00:05:29,208
The employees and
customers have been

101
00:05:29,291 --> 00:05:32,041
taken hostage and are
barricaded inside.

102
00:05:32,125 --> 00:05:35,250
The number of villains
and bystanders is unknown.

103
00:05:35,333 --> 00:05:36,833
As pro heroes,
you have been asked

104
00:05:36,916 --> 00:05:39,208
by the police to intervene
and resolve this incident

105
00:05:39,291 --> 00:05:41,041
to the best of your abilities.

106
00:05:41,125 --> 00:05:42,833
Excuse me, Mr. Aizawa!

107
00:05:42,916 --> 00:05:44,500
Our teachers--are they
playing the roles

108
00:05:44,583 --> 00:05:45,416
of hostages or villains--

109
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:47,708
I won't be answering questions.

110
00:05:47,791 --> 00:05:50,958
Verify the situation yourself
and act accordingly.

111
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,541
[STUDENTS]
Yes, sir!

112
00:05:53,625 --> 00:05:56,291
[AIZAWA] With that, let the
capture training begin.

113
00:05:56,375 --> 00:05:59,291
[buzzer blares]

114
00:05:59,375 --> 00:06:01,666
[TENYA]
Okay. What's our first move?

115
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:02,958
That's easy.

116
00:06:03,041 --> 00:06:04,291
First we need to figure
out how many villains

117
00:06:04,375 --> 00:06:05,958
and hostages there are inside.

118
00:06:06,041 --> 00:06:08,125
[KATSUKI]
Uraraka. You go.

119
00:06:08,208 --> 00:06:09,625
Me by myself?

120
00:06:09,708 --> 00:06:12,541
[KATSUKI] If we all run in,
the villains'll notice us.

121
00:06:12,625 --> 00:06:14,291
But you can float up
to the top window

122
00:06:14,375 --> 00:06:15,416
and not get caught.

123
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,541
Yeah. You're right! I'm on it.

124
00:06:17,625 --> 00:06:19,416
Isn't that dangerous?

125
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:22,625
[TODOROKI] It is. But we
can distract the villains.

126
00:06:22,708 --> 00:06:24,208
[beeping]

127
00:06:24,291 --> 00:06:25,750

128
00:06:25,833 --> 00:06:27,833
[ALL MIGHT]
Who is this? The fuzz?

129
00:06:27,916 --> 00:06:30,875
All Might's pretending
to be the criminal.

130
00:06:30,958 --> 00:06:33,291
[TODOROKI]
I'm a pro hero. And you are?

131
00:06:33,375 --> 00:06:35,666
[ALL MIGHT]
Pro shmo. I'm not impressed.

132
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:37,458
[IZUKU] Tell us how many
villains on your right hand,

133
00:06:37,541 --> 00:06:39,000
and how many hostages
on your left.

134
00:06:39,083 --> 00:06:40,708
Yeah. 'Kay.

135
00:06:40,791 --> 00:06:41,916
[TODOROKI]
Release the innocents,

136
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,916
and we'll consider your demands.

137
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,083
[ALL MIGHT]
I only have one demand.

138
00:06:46,166 --> 00:06:49,958
I want the cops and the heroes
to get the hell out of here.

139
00:06:50,041 --> 00:06:54,208
If you don't leave, I guarantee
I'll slice up these hostages.

140
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:57,833
[TODOROKI]
Very well.

141
00:06:57,916 --> 00:07:00,750
But first, I need information
on who you've got inside.

142
00:07:00,833 --> 00:07:01,958
Is anyone hurt?

143
00:07:02,041 --> 00:07:03,416
[ALL MIGHT] Someone will
be if you don't stop

144
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,083
taking your sweet time.

145
00:07:05,166 --> 00:07:07,458
Hurry up and get lost, dammit!

146
00:07:10,291 --> 00:07:12,250
[IZUKU]
One villain. Three hostages.

147
00:07:12,333 --> 00:07:16,333
Nice, Urakaka!
Stay there. Wait for us!

148
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,166
[gasps] Quick, hide!

149
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:20,625
[TSUYU]
Ribbit!

150
00:07:20,708 --> 00:07:23,541
[IZUKU] It's All Mi--
I mean, the bad guy.

151
00:07:23,625 --> 00:07:24,708
[TODOROKI]
He's checking to make sure

152
00:07:24,791 --> 00:07:26,125
that everyone's gone.

153
00:07:26,208 --> 00:07:28,000
[TSUYU] In that case,
we need to stay hidden.

154
00:07:28,083 --> 00:07:30,125
We can't put those
hostages in danger.

155
00:07:30,208 --> 00:07:31,291
How do we help them?

156
00:07:31,375 --> 00:07:33,458
Think there could
be a back way inside?

157
00:07:33,541 --> 00:07:36,250
[AIZAWA] Here's the first
big decision they must make.

158
00:07:36,333 --> 00:07:37,583
Should they contact
the villain again

159
00:07:37,666 --> 00:07:39,416
and attempt to persuade him?

160
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:40,208
Or...

161
00:07:40,291 --> 00:07:41,791
[KATSUKI yells]

162
00:07:41,875 --> 00:07:43,166
[KATSUKI]
This is stupid.

163
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:44,333
Kacchan?!

164
00:07:44,416 --> 00:07:45,833
[TENYA]
Bakugo. Calm down!

165
00:07:45,916 --> 00:07:47,833
[TODOROKI] You're planning
to charge straight in?

166
00:07:47,916 --> 00:07:49,541
Obviously.

167
00:07:49,625 --> 00:07:51,250
I'll fire off a
bunch of explosions

168
00:07:51,333 --> 00:07:52,750
and take down that villain.

169
00:07:52,833 --> 00:07:55,208
You guys can save the hostages
or whatever, I don't care.

170
00:07:55,291 --> 00:07:57,416
You're being way
too irresponsible.

171
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,333
What are you talking about?

172
00:07:59,416 --> 00:08:01,375
He's right there in the window.

173
00:08:01,458 --> 00:08:03,166
This is our chance!

174
00:08:04,666 --> 00:08:07,291
Of course. I knew
it'd go like this.

175
00:08:07,375 --> 00:08:09,083
We have to move now, too!

176
00:08:09,166 --> 00:08:10,500
[IZUKU]
Yeah. Let's go!

177
00:08:10,583 --> 00:08:12,250
[AIZAWA]
Unfortunately for you,

178
00:08:12,333 --> 00:08:15,375
this isn't a problem you
can fight your way out of.

179
00:08:15,458 --> 00:08:18,166
[gasps] The villain's
disappeared inside.

180
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:21,083
[KATSUKI] Damn it, I won't
let you have those hostages!

181
00:08:22,208 --> 00:08:23,750
[TENYA]
Oh, no! Hurry!

182
00:08:27,416 --> 00:08:30,416
Wait. Is that...?

183
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,250
[AIZAWA]
Now you get it.

184
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,666
[AIZAWA] This is the moment when
the special class really begins.


185
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:45,375
[AIZAWA] Today's training is
not what you expected it to be.


186
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:49,708
I'm interested to see how you
deal with this development.

187
00:08:49,791 --> 00:08:52,666
[IZUKU]
The villain was... killed?

188
00:08:55,666 --> 00:08:58,333
[chuckles, coughs]

189
00:08:58,416 --> 00:09:00,375
Okay, All Might's still alive.

190
00:09:00,458 --> 00:09:03,666
He's playing. But we're
supposed to think he's dead.

191
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,041
Is it because of Bakugo's blast?

192
00:09:07,125 --> 00:09:09,458
No way--it wasn't
even that strong.

193
00:09:09,541 --> 00:09:10,583
Weren't you watching?

194
00:09:10,666 --> 00:09:12,333
You were supposed
to be our eyes.

195
00:09:12,416 --> 00:09:13,916
Yeah, but, I couldn't
see anything

196
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,083
because of all the smoke.

197
00:09:15,166 --> 00:09:16,875
[growls]

198
00:09:16,958 --> 00:09:19,333
[TODOROKI] The murder weapon
is a knife covered in blood.

199
00:09:19,416 --> 00:09:21,125
[TENYA] The building was
surrounded by police,

200
00:09:21,208 --> 00:09:23,291
so we know no one
went in or out.

201
00:09:26,083 --> 00:09:28,291
That means whoever
killed the villain

202
00:09:28,375 --> 00:09:30,000
must still be inside!

203
00:09:34,083 --> 00:09:35,375
Hold on. Maybe...

204
00:09:35,458 --> 00:09:37,625
But it's too soon
to know that for sure.

205
00:09:37,708 --> 00:09:40,666
We should listen to what
they have to say first.

206
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:41,750
[TSUYU]
He's right.

207
00:09:41,833 --> 00:09:45,208
We need to know
how events unfolded.

208
00:09:45,291 --> 00:09:48,416
[CEMENTOSS] I'm but a humble
employee of this store.

209
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:51,000
A villain suddenly appeared
and threatened me.

210
00:09:51,083 --> 00:09:54,041
I handed over the jewels,
and then he tied me up.

211
00:09:55,375 --> 00:09:57,291
[MIDNIGHT] I dropped by to
pick up a few new pieces,

212
00:09:57,375 --> 00:09:59,458
and the villain
was already here.

213
00:09:59,541 --> 00:10:03,125
He caught me while I was
too surprised to resist him.

214
00:10:03,208 --> 00:10:05,708
Yo, yo, my pros. What it do?

215
00:10:05,791 --> 00:10:07,541
I came to find a bomb-ass
piece of frosting

216
00:10:07,625 --> 00:10:10,416
for my hottie GF. Then that
villain laid me out flat.

217
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:13,375
It was so not dope!

218
00:10:13,458 --> 00:10:15,041
When the villain first arrived,

219
00:10:15,125 --> 00:10:17,083
was this man already
in the store?

220
00:10:17,166 --> 00:10:18,541
Yes, he was browsing.

221
00:10:18,625 --> 00:10:20,125
That beast knocked
him unconscious,

222
00:10:20,208 --> 00:10:22,291
and he was asleep for
quite a long time.

223
00:10:22,375 --> 00:10:24,583
And when you first came
into the shop, ma'am.

224
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:26,208
Did you see both of these men?

225
00:10:26,291 --> 00:10:28,500
I didn't get a good
look when I walked in.

226
00:10:28,583 --> 00:10:30,458
But when he was tying me up...

227
00:10:30,541 --> 00:10:32,166
...I noticed these
two men had been

228
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:34,208
in different parts of the store.

229
00:10:34,291 --> 00:10:37,625
[TODOROKI] Hm. So far their
stories all seem to fit.

230
00:10:37,708 --> 00:10:39,166
[IZUKU]
Excuse me.

231
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:41,916
We need to take a quick look
through your wallets and bags.

232
00:10:43,291 --> 00:10:45,208
See anything of
interest in there?

233
00:10:45,291 --> 00:10:47,833
She's got a bunch of
credit cards and cash.

234
00:10:47,916 --> 00:10:49,958
Present Mic's is the same way.

235
00:10:50,041 --> 00:10:52,708
They both had enough money
on them to buy jewelry.

236
00:10:52,791 --> 00:10:53,833
[OCHACO]
Yeah.

237
00:10:53,916 --> 00:10:55,833
One of you killed
this stupid villain.

238
00:10:55,916 --> 00:10:57,916
Just come out and
tell us, or else.

239
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,041
What's the motive?

240
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:01,125
What?! The stolen
jewelry, you moron!

241
00:11:01,208 --> 00:11:02,916
Plus, they're just bad guys.

242
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,500
Even if that were the case,

243
00:11:04,583 --> 00:11:06,625
isn't it a little too
reckless to kill the villain

244
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:08,416
when you're locked in a store?

245
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,791
You'd definitely be a suspect.

246
00:11:10,875 --> 00:11:13,625
Besides, the criminal
dropped the jewelry.

247
00:11:13,708 --> 00:11:15,541
Yet no one took the bag.

248
00:11:15,625 --> 00:11:18,333
If the theft wasn't
the motive, then maybe...

249
00:11:18,416 --> 00:11:19,541
[OCHACO]
Another conflict?

250
00:11:19,625 --> 00:11:21,583
Yeah, if there were
two villains in here,

251
00:11:21,666 --> 00:11:23,166
and during the attack,
they argued about

252
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:24,541
how to split up the loot,

253
00:11:24,625 --> 00:11:25,916
that could be the motive.

254
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,666
If that's the case,
then the hostages

255
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:29,500
would have heard
their conversations.

256
00:11:29,583 --> 00:11:31,666
Nah, girl, I didn't
hear anything like that.

257
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:32,791
Nor did I.

258
00:11:32,875 --> 00:11:34,041
[MIDNIGHT]
Me neither.

259
00:11:34,125 --> 00:11:35,750
Then you think the
villain was working alone?

260
00:11:35,833 --> 00:11:37,250
Yes.

261
00:11:37,333 --> 00:11:39,333
[TENYA] I've inspected
every corner of the store.

262
00:11:39,416 --> 00:11:42,291
There's no back exit,
and all the windows are sealed.

263
00:11:42,375 --> 00:11:44,416
It's impossible that
anyone escaped.

264
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:47,291
Then, the person at fault
has to be one of these three.

265
00:11:47,375 --> 00:11:48,666
I didn't do it.

266
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:49,875
I'm innocent!

267
00:11:49,958 --> 00:11:51,208
[PRESENT MIC]
I'm not goin' down for this.

268
00:11:51,291 --> 00:11:53,625
It wasn't me, yo!

269
00:11:53,708 --> 00:11:55,375
[AIZAWA] They haven't been
able to find definitive

270
00:11:55,458 --> 00:11:58,125
evidence of who
the killer is yet.

271
00:11:58,208 --> 00:12:00,458
It's time for their
second big choice.

272
00:12:00,541 --> 00:12:02,416
Wouldn't it be best
to call the police?

273
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:05,208
The investigators can get
to the bottom of this case.

274
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:06,916
Perhaps that would be wise, yes.

275
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,583
[OCHACO]
This is so frustrating.

276
00:12:08,666 --> 00:12:12,333
We know the culprit has
to be one of these people!

277
00:12:12,416 --> 00:12:13,333
[KATSUKI]
Simple.

278
00:12:13,416 --> 00:12:14,500
[PRESENT MIC yelps]

279
00:12:14,583 --> 00:12:16,708
We'll just force them
to start talking!

280
00:12:16,791 --> 00:12:17,333
Bakugo!

281
00:12:17,416 --> 00:12:18,458
Be a hero.

282
00:12:18,541 --> 00:12:20,208
If you torture them,
then the police

283
00:12:20,291 --> 00:12:22,500
will arrest you along
with the perpetrator.

284
00:12:22,583 --> 00:12:25,208
I didn't say anything
about torture!

285
00:12:28,166 --> 00:12:29,500
Hey, you damn nerd.

286
00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:31,750
You've got a new idea,
haven't you?

287
00:12:31,833 --> 00:12:35,250
Uh--! Well. Something's
bothering me here.

288
00:12:35,333 --> 00:12:36,750
[TODOROKI]
What is it?

289
00:12:36,833 --> 00:12:39,125
Why did the villain barricade
himself inside the store?

290
00:12:39,208 --> 00:12:40,958
You know?

291
00:12:41,041 --> 00:12:43,541
'Cause, if he wanted to,
he could have just

292
00:12:43,625 --> 00:12:45,541
escaped with the goods earlier.

293
00:12:45,625 --> 00:12:47,583
So then, why did he stay?

294
00:12:47,666 --> 00:12:48,833
[CEMENTOSS]
Timing wise,

295
00:12:48,916 --> 00:12:50,833
the authorities arrived
just as I was putting

296
00:12:50,916 --> 00:12:52,375
the jewelry in a bag for him.

297
00:12:52,458 --> 00:12:54,750
He had no opportunity to flee.

298
00:12:54,833 --> 00:12:56,333
[OCHACO]
Did you call the police?

299
00:12:56,416 --> 00:12:58,250
I never had the chance.

300
00:12:58,333 --> 00:13:00,000
Someone outside the
store must've seen

301
00:13:00,083 --> 00:13:01,125
what was happening.

302
00:13:01,208 --> 00:13:03,291
They're the ones who
called the police.

303
00:13:03,375 --> 00:13:06,125
If that's the case,
then it has to mean...

304
00:13:06,208 --> 00:13:08,083
Midnight, it was you.

305
00:13:08,166 --> 00:13:10,458
[gasps] What? Me?

306
00:13:10,541 --> 00:13:11,875
[IZUKU] You were the
only one who came into

307
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:14,500
the jewelry store after
the villain was already here.

308
00:13:14,583 --> 00:13:16,166
Don't be hasty, Midoriya.

309
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:18,416
Don't you make us look
like a buncha idiots.

310
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:20,000
Why would somebody
who called the police

311
00:13:20,083 --> 00:13:22,208
come inside to face the
villain and allow themselves

312
00:13:22,291 --> 00:13:24,166
to be taken as a hostage?

313
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:25,625
Hear me out.

314
00:13:27,291 --> 00:13:28,666
I think she's the
reason the villain

315
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:31,416
barricaded himself
in here to begin with.

316
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:35,416
[IZUKU] Midnight. You knew
the man on the floor

317
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:37,625
before this incident,
didn't you?

318
00:13:39,583 --> 00:13:41,458
[IZUKU] And not just
as an acquaintance--

319
00:13:41,541 --> 00:13:44,250
you knew he committed crimes.

320
00:13:44,333 --> 00:13:46,791
You saw him and knew he was
going to rob the jewelry store,

321
00:13:46,875 --> 00:13:48,250
so you called the
police the moment

322
00:13:48,333 --> 00:13:51,500
he went inside so
they would stop him.

323
00:13:51,583 --> 00:13:53,958
And then, before
they could arrive...

324
00:13:56,333 --> 00:13:58,416
[IZUKU]
You decided to go in yourself.

325
00:14:01,958 --> 00:14:03,875
[IZUKU] He must've been
shaken to see you.

326
00:14:03,958 --> 00:14:06,458
But he also understood
your true intentions.

327
00:14:06,541 --> 00:14:08,250
Why you were there.

328
00:14:09,291 --> 00:14:11,291
[IZUKU] Even so, the villain
continued the robbery

329
00:14:11,375 --> 00:14:13,333
and tied you up like the others.

330
00:14:14,375 --> 00:14:16,666
[IZUKU] While he was doing
that, the police arrived,

331
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:19,833
and he was forced to barricade
himself in the store.

332
00:14:19,916 --> 00:14:21,291
[MIDNIGHT]
No!

333
00:14:21,375 --> 00:14:23,708
Why would I willingly put
myself in danger like that?

334
00:14:23,791 --> 00:14:25,958
Because you wanted him
to change his life.

335
00:14:26,041 --> 00:14:27,291
[gasps]

336
00:14:27,375 --> 00:14:28,625
[IZUKU]
Didn't you?

337
00:14:30,666 --> 00:14:32,666
[IZUKU] No matter how any times
you tried to convince him

338
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:35,583
to step away from
crime, he wouldn't.

339
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:37,041
So you made sure
that, this time,

340
00:14:37,125 --> 00:14:38,833
he'd be forced to
change his ways.

341
00:14:38,916 --> 00:14:40,583
[gasps] Wait, Deku.

342
00:14:40,666 --> 00:14:43,416
Even if things happened the
way you just said they did...

343
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,500
Why would she kill the villain?

344
00:14:45,583 --> 00:14:48,000
[TODOROKI] All she wanted
to do was get him arrested.

345
00:14:48,083 --> 00:14:49,041
[TENYA]
Yeah, that's right.

346
00:14:49,125 --> 00:14:51,833
She has no motive to kill him.

347
00:14:51,916 --> 00:14:54,333
True. There's no motive.

348
00:14:55,875 --> 00:14:57,625
[IZUKU]
That's why the murderer...

349
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:01,250
[IZUKU]
...isn't one of these three.

350
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:02,250
What are you talking about?

351
00:15:02,333 --> 00:15:04,541
Seriously, Deku, hold on!

352
00:15:04,625 --> 00:15:06,250
Could it have been...

353
00:15:06,333 --> 00:15:08,500
Suicide. Right?

354
00:15:09,916 --> 00:15:11,250
Probably.

355
00:15:11,333 --> 00:15:14,041
Once he figured out what
Midnight's intentions must be,

356
00:15:14,125 --> 00:15:17,625
it's likely he still expected
to escape as planned.

357
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:20,375
But then we pro heroes
showed up on the scene.

358
00:15:20,458 --> 00:15:22,750
He refused to be taken alive.

359
00:15:22,833 --> 00:15:24,583
[IZUKU]
Not quite.

360
00:15:24,666 --> 00:15:27,458
I think he was worried
about something else.

361
00:15:27,541 --> 00:15:29,208
If he was caught by the police,

362
00:15:29,291 --> 00:15:31,583
his relationship with Midnight
might have been exposed,

363
00:15:31,666 --> 00:15:34,083
putting her in all
sorts of trouble.

364
00:15:34,166 --> 00:15:35,583
If that had happened,

365
00:15:35,666 --> 00:15:38,750
a dark shadow would've fallen
over the rest of her life.

366
00:15:43,083 --> 00:15:45,208
[IZUKU]
That's why this villain

367
00:15:45,291 --> 00:15:47,666
silenced himself
with his own weapon.

368
00:15:50,083 --> 00:15:52,166
[IZUKU] Midnight didn't say
anything because she realized

369
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:54,625
what he was thinking when
he took his own life,

370
00:15:54,708 --> 00:15:57,833
the sacrifice he was making
so that she could live.

371
00:16:01,125 --> 00:16:04,291
[IZUKU] Out of respect,
she couldn't say anything.

372
00:16:06,291 --> 00:16:09,958
You think Midnight and the
villain were that in love?

373
00:16:10,041 --> 00:16:11,333
[IZUKU]
Mm-hm.

374
00:16:11,416 --> 00:16:12,708
That's so sad.

375
00:16:12,791 --> 00:16:14,833
Midnight was only trying
to help the criminal

376
00:16:14,916 --> 00:16:16,750
because she cared
so much about him.

377
00:16:16,833 --> 00:16:18,750
And the robber was
trying to save Midnight,

378
00:16:18,833 --> 00:16:22,333
because deep in his villainous
heart, he loved her, as well.

379
00:16:22,416 --> 00:16:23,708
They were both just
trying to look out

380
00:16:23,791 --> 00:16:27,708
for each other.
That's ironic, isn't it?

381
00:16:27,791 --> 00:16:30,083
[IZUKU] I believe that
this is the truth behind

382
00:16:30,166 --> 00:16:31,958
the attack in the jewelry store.

383
00:16:32,041 --> 00:16:33,750
[TSUYU sadly]
Ribbit.

384
00:16:33,833 --> 00:16:36,666
[KATSUKI] This was actually
some kinda love story?!

385
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:38,375
[AIZAWA]
Okay, that's enough.

386
00:16:38,458 --> 00:16:40,750
Ooh! This was so fun!

387
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:42,583
[OCHACO, IZUKU, TENYA, TSUYU]
What a 180!

388
00:16:42,666 --> 00:16:44,750
Thanks, you three.
You're all done here.

389
00:16:44,833 --> 00:16:46,875
Save your strength
for the next group?

390
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:48,541
[PRESENT MIC]
What'd you think of my acting?

391
00:16:48,625 --> 00:16:50,625
[CEMENTOSS]
I'd reel it in a bit.

392
00:16:50,708 --> 00:16:51,875
Midoriya.

393
00:16:51,958 --> 00:16:52,958
Sir!

394
00:16:53,041 --> 00:16:54,291
[AIZAWA]
Your deductions were exactly

395
00:16:54,375 --> 00:16:57,500
what we had scripted
for this scenario.

396
00:16:57,583 --> 00:17:01,166
The villain did stab
himself with his own knife.

397
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:03,166
It was smart work getting
to that conclusion

398
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:06,333
by asking a logical
series of questions.

399
00:17:06,416 --> 00:17:08,833
Wow! Praise from Mr. Aizawa!

400
00:17:08,916 --> 00:17:10,541
Extremely well done, Midoriya!

401
00:17:10,625 --> 00:17:11,458
[IZUKU chuckles]

402
00:17:11,541 --> 00:17:13,458
[AIZAWA]
But you weren't perfect.

403
00:17:13,541 --> 00:17:16,333
You six overlooked
one major thing.

404
00:17:16,416 --> 00:17:19,125
Therefore, you earned...

405
00:17:19,208 --> 00:17:20,625
...zero points.

406
00:17:20,708 --> 00:17:21,416

You've gottta be kidding!

00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:25,416
[AIZAWA]
Observe.

409
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:26,458
[OCHACO]
What?

410
00:17:26,541 --> 00:17:28,125

The villain's body is gone!

[IZUKU, OCHACO, TENYA]
He's alive!

413
00:17:31,791 --> 00:17:32,833
[ALL MIGHT]
I am fleeing the scene

414
00:17:32,916 --> 00:17:34,583
and running toward freedom!

415
00:17:34,666 --> 00:17:37,833
[ALL MIGHT cackling]

416
00:17:37,916 --> 00:17:39,333
[AIZAWA] You were all
under the assumption

417
00:17:39,416 --> 00:17:42,208
that the villain was a corpse,
so you didn't tie him up.

418
00:17:42,291 --> 00:17:44,250
And that's why you all fail.

419
00:17:45,291 --> 00:17:47,708
[KATSUKI]
Is that even allowed?

420
00:17:47,791 --> 00:17:49,750
Didn't you realize that
All Might gave you a hint

421
00:17:49,833 --> 00:17:51,041
about the truth?

422
00:17:51,125 --> 00:17:52,625
He tried to help you.

[AIZAWA]
He reacted, didn't he?

427
00:17:58,833 --> 00:18:02,208
You thought it was a mistake.
But he was alive.

428
00:18:02,291 --> 00:18:05,458
That's it for your special
class. You're dismissed.

429
00:18:06,583 --> 00:18:08,291
Aw, man.

430
00:18:08,375 --> 00:18:10,000
[KATSUKI]
That's a dirty trick!

431
00:18:10,083 --> 00:18:14,291
Uh-- Wait a second. If the
villain is alive, then...

432
00:18:14,375 --> 00:18:15,750
He pretended to kill himself,

433
00:18:15,833 --> 00:18:18,000
but looked for a chance
to escape the whole time!

434
00:18:18,083 --> 00:18:19,750
He didn't stay
there for Midnight!

435
00:18:19,833 --> 00:18:21,625
Midnight misunderstood
and thought he did

436
00:18:21,708 --> 00:18:23,416
everything because
he wanted to protect

437
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:24,916
her name and honor.

438
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,208
But their love story!

00:18:26,291 --> 00:18:27,375
It was...!

440
00:18:27,458 --> 00:18:29,125
...never real.

Huh? What are you doing here?

475
00:20:04,291 --> 00:20:06,208
[ALL MIGHT coughs]

476
00:20:06,291 --> 00:20:07,666
Young Midoriya.

477
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:10,416
There's a place called I-island.
You ever hear of it?

478
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:13,291
Oh, yeah, for sure.
I-island is amazing!

479
00:20:13,375 --> 00:20:14,791
Every company in the
world that's involved

480
00:20:14,875 --> 00:20:16,500
in the hero business
invested money to create

481
00:20:16,583 --> 00:20:18,208
a technological paradise
for the research

482
00:20:18,291 --> 00:20:19,750
and development of Quirks
and support items!

483
00:20:19,833 --> 00:20:21,291
The result was an artificial,
mobile island where

484
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:22,708
almost 10,000
scientists now live.

485
00:20:22,791 --> 00:20:23,916
It's incredible!
It's security system...

486
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,416
Do you wanna go there with me?

487
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:29,916
[gasps] Really? You want
us to go together?

488
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,291
I don't mean we'll
just be goofin' off.

489
00:20:32,375 --> 00:20:34,791
Now that you've officially
become my successor,

490
00:20:34,875 --> 00:20:36,208
there are lots of
tricks of the trade

491
00:20:36,291 --> 00:20:38,250
you need to learn about.

492
00:20:38,333 --> 00:20:40,083
You're doing it for me?

493
00:20:40,166 --> 00:20:41,875
Are you sure about this?

494
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:46,666
Let's go!

495
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:47,916
Then you'd better
run up to your room

496
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,250
and pack your bags
right away so we can jet.

497
00:20:50,333 --> 00:20:52,125
Can't keep the plane waiting.

498
00:20:53,416 --> 00:20:54,958
We're going now?!

499
00:20:55,041 --> 00:20:56,625
[ALL MIGHT]
Yes! Hurry up! Go!

500
00:20:56,708 --> 00:20:58,166
[IZUKU]
Ah, yeah, yeah, I'm going!

501
00:20:58,250 --> 00:20:59,791
Don't leave without me!

502
00:22:30,958 --> 00:22:32,416
Young Midoriya!

503
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:35,125
Did you enjoy my star
turn as a criminal?

504
00:22:35,208 --> 00:22:36,875
You almost caught me!

505
00:22:36,958 --> 00:22:39,333
Man, I'm such a sucker
for love stories.

506
00:22:39,416 --> 00:22:41,541
[IZUKU] Well, it wasn't
actually a love story.

507
00:22:41,625 --> 00:22:42,583
But!

508
00:22:42,666 --> 00:22:43,666
More importantly, we're going

509
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:45,583
to I-Island really
soon, aren't we?

510
00:22:45,666 --> 00:22:47,041
What's it like over
there, All Might?

511
00:22:47,125 --> 00:22:49,916
You'll see! But only
if you watch the movie!

512
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,916
Oh, I get it, nice plug.

513
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,541
People can watch
<i>My Hero Academia: Two Heroes</i>

514
00:22:54,625 --> 00:22:56,833
in theaters soon!

515
00:22:56,916 --> 00:22:58,916
Spoken like a true
hero of marketing!

516
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,416
[laughs]

517
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:03,083
Next time we'll continue where
the last episode left off!

518
00:23:03,166 --> 00:23:04,625
Can Young Midoriya and the rest

519
00:23:04,708 --> 00:23:07,083
of his intrepid classmates
defeat Gang Orca,

520
00:23:07,166 --> 00:23:09,333
who barged into the middle
of the second round?

521
00:23:09,416 --> 00:23:10,416
Will they be able to get

522
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:12,833
their provisional hero
licenses or not?

523
00:23:12,916 --> 00:23:14,458
They might fail miserably!

524
00:23:14,541 --> 00:23:16,208
[IZUKU]
Come on, why would you say that?

525
00:23:16,291 --> 00:23:17,375
Anyway.

526
00:23:17,458 --> 00:23:20,041
Thank you so much
for watching the show.

527
00:23:20,125 --> 00:23:22,208
[BOTH]
You are the real heroes!

528
00:23:22,291 --> 00:23:23,458
You ready, kid?

529
00:23:23,541 --> 00:23:25,166
[BOTH]
Let's say it together!

530
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:28,958
Go Beyond! Plus Ultra!

531
00:23:29,041 --> 00:23:30,166
[IZUKU]
Here's the preview!

532
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:32,125
In the final round
of our licensing exam,

533
00:23:32,208 --> 00:23:34,166
a villain has sprung
onto the scene.

534
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:35,750
Do we fight or run?

535
00:23:35,833 --> 00:23:37,000
We're going to have
to work together

536
00:23:37,083 --> 00:23:38,666
to get out of this situation.

537
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:40,708
Next time: "What's
the Big Idea?"

538
00:23:40,791 --> 00:23:43,250
Go beyond! Plus Ultra!
