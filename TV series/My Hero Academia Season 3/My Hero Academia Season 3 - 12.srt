1
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:15,233
[ALL MIGHT] I've used up
everything inside of me.

2
00:00:18,775 --> 00:00:22,275
[ALL MIGHT]
Now. It's your turn.

3
00:02:00,733 --> 00:02:01,817
[REPORTING OFFICER]
The Nomu we captured

4
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:04,025
are just as unresponsive
as the last ones.

5
00:02:04,108 --> 00:02:06,067
They're basically
mindless animals.

6
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:08,733
We haven't gotten any
new info from them.

7
00:02:08,817 --> 00:02:11,942
The warehouse they were kept
in was completely destroyed.

8
00:02:12,025 --> 00:02:14,192
We'll continue our
investigation, of course,

9
00:02:14,275 --> 00:02:16,733
but we don't know how much
data we can collect.

10
00:02:16,817 --> 00:02:19,317
And we haven't gotten any
worthwhile information

11
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,817
from the bar at all?

12
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:22,483
We're still looking
into that, sir.

13
00:02:22,567 --> 00:02:24,192
[POLICE CHIEF groans]

14
00:02:24,275 --> 00:02:26,317
We apprehended all
the Nomu, sure,

15
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,775
but we let most of
the perpetrators,

16
00:02:27,858 --> 00:02:30,192
including Shigaraki,
slip through our fingers.

17
00:02:30,275 --> 00:02:32,150
Honestly, even though
we captured their boss,

18
00:02:32,233 --> 00:02:34,608
I'd have to say this
whole thing was a draw.

19
00:02:34,692 --> 00:02:36,608
[POLICE CHIEF]
Don't be stupid.

20
00:02:36,692 --> 00:02:39,483
Our country just lost
the Symbol of Peace.

21
00:02:39,567 --> 00:02:43,358
All Might's weakened body has
been exposed to the world.

22
00:02:43,442 --> 00:02:45,692
Everyone knows the
indestructible hero

23
00:02:45,775 --> 00:02:47,400
can be defeated now.

24
00:02:47,483 --> 00:02:50,067
The citizens and the villains.

25
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:53,400
It's what we get for relying
too much on one pro hero.

26
00:02:53,483 --> 00:02:55,275
People now know
they can raise hell

27
00:02:55,358 --> 00:02:57,108
with just a handful of thugs.

28
00:02:57,192 --> 00:02:59,733
Hate to think what
that might inspire.

29
00:02:59,817 --> 00:03:02,483
Our initial profile of Tomura
Shigaraki described him

30
00:03:02,567 --> 00:03:04,942
as childish and
prone to tantrums,

31
00:03:05,025 --> 00:03:06,858
but that's obviously changed.

32
00:03:06,942 --> 00:03:09,067
His plans are growing
more strategic.

33
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:13,400
He now appears to be focused
on how he can mold our society.

34
00:03:13,483 --> 00:03:16,525
His thought process
has evolved. Matured.

35
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:18,442
And since All Might's
out of the picture,

36
00:03:18,525 --> 00:03:21,358
we've lost our biggest deterrent
to criminal activity.

37
00:03:21,442 --> 00:03:24,567
Each time the League fails,
they come back stronger.

38
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:29,275
And now, Shigaraki can greatly
expand his sphere of influence.

39
00:03:29,358 --> 00:03:30,858
Are you suggesting
that all of this

40
00:03:30,942 --> 00:03:32,275
was part of the League's plan?

41
00:03:32,358 --> 00:03:34,067
That does sound
like quite a leap.

42
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:35,733
[POLICE CHIEF]
We don't know.

43
00:03:35,817 --> 00:03:38,025
There's only one thing
I can say for certain.

44
00:03:38,108 --> 00:03:40,942
We must capture the League
of Villains, no matter what.

45
00:03:41,025 --> 00:03:42,900
As the police, we have
to be more proactive

46
00:03:42,983 --> 00:03:44,025
in apprehending villains.

47
00:03:44,108 --> 00:03:46,442
We are not just backup.

48
00:03:46,525 --> 00:03:49,942
It's time we implement changes.

49
00:03:50,025 --> 00:03:53,608
[ALL MIGHT] The embers inside
of me have been snuffed out.

50
00:03:53,692 --> 00:03:57,150
The mighty Symbol
of Peace is no more.

51
00:03:57,233 --> 00:04:00,192
However... I won't
just sit here.

52
00:04:00,275 --> 00:04:02,400
There's still
something I must do.

53
00:04:02,483 --> 00:04:06,775
Tomura Shigaraki.
Shimura's grandson. Yes?

54
00:04:06,858 --> 00:04:08,150
[TSUKAUCHI]
The only proof we have of that

55
00:04:08,233 --> 00:04:09,608
is what All For One said.

56
00:04:09,692 --> 00:04:11,233
It's not much to go on.

57
00:04:11,317 --> 00:04:12,983
The two of you didn't
have any interactions

58
00:04:13,067 --> 00:04:15,650
with Shimura's family, even
though you were so close to her?

59
00:04:15,733 --> 00:04:16,650
No.

60
00:04:16,733 --> 00:04:18,567
But why not?

61
00:04:18,650 --> 00:04:21,942
It happened soon after
Shimura's husband was killed.

62
00:04:22,025 --> 00:04:24,358
Concerned, she put her
child in foster care

63
00:04:24,442 --> 00:04:26,900
to shield the youngster
from the hero world.

64
00:04:26,983 --> 00:04:29,567
She told Toshinori and me
that she didn't want us

65
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:31,275
to have any contact
with the kid,

66
00:04:31,358 --> 00:04:34,442
even if something terrible
were to happen to her.

67
00:04:34,525 --> 00:04:37,025
And in the end, your
promise backfired, huh?

68
00:04:37,108 --> 00:04:39,025
I'm sorry to hear that.

69
00:04:40,108 --> 00:04:41,400
My master gave up her heart

70
00:04:41,483 --> 00:04:44,525
so that her family might
know a life full of peace.

71
00:04:44,608 --> 00:04:47,650
I must track Shigaraki down,
as soon as possible.

72
00:04:47,733 --> 00:04:49,025
I'll find him, and then--

73
00:04:49,108 --> 00:04:52,067
Then what? Give him
a pat on the head?

74
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:54,900
You're not looking at him like
the villain he is anymore.

75
00:04:54,983 --> 00:04:56,442
That's dangerous.

76
00:04:56,525 --> 00:05:00,317
Remember that no matter his
lineage, he's still a criminal.

77
00:05:01,442 --> 00:05:04,358
Tsukauchi and I will investigate
Shigaraki and the League

78
00:05:04,442 --> 00:05:05,900
without you for now.

79
00:05:05,983 --> 00:05:09,942
You stay at U.A. You still have
many responsibilities there.

80
00:05:10,025 --> 00:05:13,442
Even if you cannot be the Symbol
of Peace that you once were,

81
00:05:13,525 --> 00:05:16,900
don't forget that All
Might is still alive.

82
00:05:18,817 --> 00:05:22,733
[IZUKU] After the fight, we met
up with Todoroki and Yaoyorozu.

83
00:05:22,817 --> 00:05:26,275
The five of us took Kacchan
to meet with the police.

84
00:05:26,358 --> 00:05:29,608
The whole way there,
he was silent.

85
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:33,067
[IZUKU]
And then, after our worlds

86
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:36,733
had been turned upside down,
we finally went home.

87
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:46,692
[FUYUMI]
There you are, Shoto!

88
00:05:46,775 --> 00:05:48,942
I was afraid something
had happened to you.

89
00:05:49,025 --> 00:05:50,025
After you visited Mom,

90
00:05:50,108 --> 00:05:51,608
you stopped responding
to my messages,

91
00:05:51,692 --> 00:05:53,233
so what was I supposed to think?

92
00:05:53,317 --> 00:05:54,525
[TODOROKI]
I'm sorry, sis.

He's been like that
ever since he came home.

00:06:00,858 --> 00:06:03,067
Feel free to go say hi.

96
00:06:04,775 --> 00:06:06,442
[TODOROKI] If All Might
really can't be the hero

97
00:06:06,525 --> 00:06:09,317
he once was anymore,
then the number-one spot...

98
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,567
...is finally my father's.

99
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:25,525
I don't accept it.
Not like this!

100
00:06:25,608 --> 00:06:30,025
I should have earned it myself.
Not by him failing!

101

[IZUKU'S MOM]
Oh, honey.

102
00:06:32,817 --> 00:06:36,608
I just can't believe what a hard
time All Might's had lately.

103
00:06:36,692 --> 00:06:38,608
Things must've been
difficult for you, too.

104
00:06:38,692 --> 00:06:39,900
But at least you're home.

105
00:06:39,983 --> 00:06:41,400
Yeah.

106
00:06:48,192 --> 00:06:51,108
[IZUKU]
I wonder what'll happen now.

107
00:06:51,192 --> 00:06:53,025
Did I do the right thing,

108
00:06:53,108 --> 00:06:55,733
leaving him to fight
alone back there?

109

115
00:07:23,692 --> 00:07:25,942
Ah. You finally made it.

00:07:26,025 --> 00:07:27,525
Are you okay?

117
00:07:27,608 --> 00:07:29,317
It sure took you long enough!

You made a promise.

But as it turns out,
you can't keep your word.

122

Ugh, if you kids'd gotten hurt,
it would've all been in vain.

You've got some bad influences.

[ALL MIGHT]
Young Midoriya. Listen.

125
00:07:50,942 --> 00:07:53,358
I'm officially retired as a pro.

126
00:07:53,442 --> 00:07:55,483
It's clear that my body
isn't going to allow me

to fight another battle.

I can't protect you when you
put yourself in danger now.

And you're always

no matter what I tell you.

I will devote myself
to training you.

You're stuck with me, so let's

Nothing would make me
happier, All Might.

about keepin' your word,

lingered on my cheek.

I barely felt it.
So I knew it was true.

All Might's reign as top hero
had come to an end.

[NEZU]
Thank you, All Might.

You've saved thousands
of people's lives

though it cost you
your body and strength.

00:09:25,775 --> 00:09:28,900
I cannot express how
grateful we all are to you.

159
00:09:28,983 --> 00:09:31,483
However, given everything
that's happened,

160
00:09:31,567 --> 00:09:32,900
there are many
who do not believe

161
00:09:32,983 --> 00:09:35,650
you should continue
as a teacher at U.A.

162
00:09:35,733 --> 00:09:37,817
Some are pointing out
that our troubles began

163
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:39,650
when you started working here.

164
00:09:39,733 --> 00:09:41,275
They're worried the
children will continue

165
00:09:41,358 --> 00:09:42,650
to be caught in the crossfire,

166
00:09:42,733 --> 00:09:45,733
and that you can't
protect them anymore.

167
00:09:45,817 --> 00:09:47,858
It is a delicate situation.

168
00:09:47,942 --> 00:09:50,108
Nevertheless, I believe
I know what we need to do

169
00:09:50,192 --> 00:09:52,858
to ease the concerns the
public has expressed.

170
00:09:52,942 --> 00:09:54,608
We must strengthen
the faith people have

171
00:09:54,692 --> 00:09:56,775
in the heroes we have left.

172
00:09:56,858 --> 00:09:59,483
It's true, the threat we
face is still troubling.

173
00:09:59,567 --> 00:10:00,817
But we will protect and train

174
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:03,567
with more focus and
diligence than ever before.

175
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:05,900
That is why we're going
to implement a plan

176
00:10:05,983 --> 00:10:09,358
I've had in mind for a while.

177
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:13,108
I'm counting on you to convince
the students' families.

178
00:10:14,817 --> 00:10:17,775
[JIRO'S DAD] I dunno. Sounds
pretty outta tune to me.

179
00:10:17,858 --> 00:10:19,942
I get that you guys don't
wanna keep talking about

180
00:10:20,025 --> 00:10:21,942
what happened, but movin'
the kids into dorms

181
00:10:22,025 --> 00:10:24,608
isn't going to change the fact
that my daughter was injured.

182
00:10:24,692 --> 00:10:27,150
What you're saying is
quite true, Mr. Jiro.

183
00:10:27,233 --> 00:10:28,608
However, I'd like to assure you

184
00:10:28,692 --> 00:10:30,692
that this is not a
matter of U.A.'s pride.

185
00:10:30,775 --> 00:10:32,275
We've thought long
and hard on the issue,

186
00:10:32,358 --> 00:10:35,608
and believe this to be
the best course of action.

187
00:10:35,692 --> 00:10:37,067
I hope that you'll
give us the honor

188
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:39,108
of continuing to teach Kyoka.

189
00:10:39,192 --> 00:10:41,525
I believe whole-heartedly
that U.A. can help her grow

190
00:10:41,608 --> 00:10:43,817
into the best hero she can be.

191
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:45,067
[JIRO]
Whoa.

192
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:47,775
No need for you to be
all formal, Mr. Aizawa.

193
00:10:47,858 --> 00:10:49,400
We decided what we
were going to do

194
00:10:49,483 --> 00:10:51,442
right after we got
the notice in the mail.

195
00:10:51,525 --> 00:10:54,233
I mean, you shoulda heard my old
man during All Might's fight.

196
00:10:54,317 --> 00:10:56,817
My daughter's teacher
is so hardcore, man!

197
00:10:56,900 --> 00:11:00,483
That battlefield is a stadium
and he's rockin' it down!

198
00:11:00,567 --> 00:11:02,317
Yeah, I'm pretty
sure he was crying.

199
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,817
Kyoka, c'mon!

200
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:05,733
I was tryin' to act all strict
'n stuff for these dudes.

201
00:11:05,817 --> 00:11:06,775
[JIRO]
Oh, chill, Dad.

202
00:11:06,858 --> 00:11:07,983
[JIRO'S MOM]
Hey, cut it out you two.

203
00:11:08,067 --> 00:11:10,400
Save the aggression
for your music.

204
00:11:12,025 --> 00:11:13,483
[AIZAWA]
Y'know,

205
00:11:13,567 --> 00:11:16,775
I thought the parents would
come down on us a lot harder.

206
00:11:16,858 --> 00:11:19,983
I suppose... I owe you a drink.

207
00:11:20,067 --> 00:11:21,025
[chuckles]

208
00:11:21,108 --> 00:11:23,150
No thanks. I can't drink.

209
00:11:23,233 --> 00:11:25,150
Besides, it's not a contest.

210
00:11:25,233 --> 00:11:29,317
Plus, the next family...
probably won't be so easy.

211
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,400
You kiddin'? Hell yeah, get
this kid in a dorm room.

212
00:11:31,483 --> 00:11:33,400
You hag! Hit me again
and I'll kill you!

213
00:11:33,483 --> 00:11:34,983
Oh, hush!

214
00:11:35,067 --> 00:11:36,817
If you hadn't been so damn weak,
you never would've gotten caught

215
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:38,650
and caused all that trouble.

216
00:11:38,733 --> 00:11:41,067
C'mon, you two.
Please. No fighting.

217
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:43,275
We don't wanna frighten
your teachers, do we?

218
00:11:43,358 --> 00:11:44,817
[KATSUKI]
Shut it, you clown!

219
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:46,442
[KATSUKI'S MOM] Yeah, you're
the one who needs to butt out!

220
00:11:46,525 --> 00:11:50,275
Oh, don't you even think about
using your Quirk, Katsuki.

221
00:11:50,358 --> 00:11:53,233
[ALL MIGHT]
Jeez, some family dynamic.

222
00:11:53,317 --> 00:11:56,400
[AIZAWA] So you're saying
you give us your consent?

223
00:11:56,483 --> 00:11:57,567
[KATSUKI'S MOM]
Hm?

224
00:11:57,650 --> 00:12:00,400
Oh, the dorm?
Actually, we're grateful.

225
00:12:00,483 --> 00:12:02,650
Katsuki's fearless and good
at everything he tries,

226
00:12:02,733 --> 00:12:05,233
especially since he's got
that stupid-awesome Quirk.

227
00:12:05,317 --> 00:12:06,650
People were always
fawning over him

228
00:12:06,733 --> 00:12:08,775
whether he deserved it or not.

229
00:12:08,858 --> 00:12:12,275
It's probably why he
ended up like this.

230
00:12:12,358 --> 00:12:15,317
That's why I liked what you
said. At the press conference.

231
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,400
[AIZAWA] He's trying harder
than anyone in his pursuit

232
00:12:17,483 --> 00:12:19,858
to become the top hero.

233
00:12:19,942 --> 00:12:22,900
Those villains will
not change his mind.

234
00:12:22,983 --> 00:12:26,942
He'll continue on his path.
I can guarantee you of that.

235
00:12:27,025 --> 00:12:28,358
See, that's when I understood

236
00:12:28,442 --> 00:12:30,817
that the school was
watching him closely.

237
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:32,567
I was worried about
the kid, obviously,

238
00:12:32,650 --> 00:12:34,233
and didn't know
what would happen.

239
00:12:34,317 --> 00:12:38,025
But he's back now, safe and
sound, so it worked out.

240
00:12:38,108 --> 00:12:41,108
I'm sure U.A. will face harsh
criticism from some people.

241
00:12:41,192 --> 00:12:43,567
We still trust you, though,
so we'll leave him to you.

242
00:12:43,650 --> 00:12:44,358
Right?

243
00:12:44,442 --> 00:12:45,692
[KATSUKI'S DAD]
Mh-hm!

244
00:12:46,983 --> 00:12:48,150
[KATSUKI'S MOM]
He's a hot-tempered brat,

245
00:12:48,233 --> 00:12:49,567
and we know he's a pain,

246
00:12:49,650 --> 00:12:52,817
but please train him hard
and make him a good hero.

247
00:12:54,650 --> 00:12:55,692
[AIZAWA]
Hm?

248
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:58,275
I owe you a drink for this one.

249
00:12:59,942 --> 00:13:01,317
[AIZAWA]
Okay, let's see.

250
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:04,025
Midoriya's house is
close by, isn't it?

251
00:13:04,108 --> 00:13:05,233
[KATSUKI]
All Might.

252
00:13:05,317 --> 00:13:06,483
Huh?

253
00:13:08,858 --> 00:13:12,233
[ALL MIGHT]
Now. It's your turn.

254
00:13:14,483 --> 00:13:18,483
I gotta know. What
exactly is Deku to you?

255
00:13:20,817 --> 00:13:24,108
He's my student. Just like you.

256
00:13:24,192 --> 00:13:27,233
A fledgling hero with
bright prospects.

257
00:13:28,567 --> 00:13:30,525
[ALL MIGHT]
I'm sorry, Young Bakugo,

258
00:13:30,608 --> 00:13:33,775
but I can't say any
more than that.

259
00:13:33,858 --> 00:13:35,192
[KATSUKI'S MOM]
Dammit, Katsuki!

260
00:13:35,275 --> 00:13:38,775
The police said not to go
wandering off by yourself!

261
00:13:38,858 --> 00:13:40,067
[KATSUKI]
Yeah, sure.

262
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:42,692
If you don't wanna
tell me, that's fine.

263
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:45,983
Oh, and thank you.

264
00:13:46,067 --> 00:13:46,983
[KATSUKI'S MOM]
Katsuki!

265
00:13:47,067 --> 00:13:48,858
[KATSUKI]
I heard you!

266
00:13:52,358 --> 00:13:54,525
[AIZAWA] You're sure you'll
be all right by yourself?

267
00:13:54,608 --> 00:13:55,525
Yeah.

268
00:13:55,608 --> 00:13:56,525
We need to sit
down with everyone

269
00:13:56,608 --> 00:13:58,817
in Class A by day's end, right?

270
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:00,150
So we'll divide and conquer.

271
00:14:00,233 --> 00:14:01,775
I'll take this place
and you can move on

272
00:14:01,858 --> 00:14:04,525
to the next person
we have to convince.

273
00:14:06,358 --> 00:14:09,608
Oh! Please come on inside.
We're so honored.

274
00:14:09,692 --> 00:14:11,108
[ALL MIGHT]
Thank you.

275
00:14:11,192 --> 00:14:12,733
[IZUKU'S MOM] I can't believe
All Might is in our home!

276
00:14:12,817 --> 00:14:15,233
Be cool, Mom. It's totally fine.

277
00:14:17,358 --> 00:14:18,733
[chuckles]

278
00:14:20,483 --> 00:14:22,858
[ALL MIGHT] You probably
already know why I'm here.

279
00:14:22,942 --> 00:14:24,275
You received a notice that U.A.

280
00:14:24,358 --> 00:14:26,567
is moving our students
to dormitories?

281
00:14:26,650 --> 00:14:29,900
Yes, about that,
I read the letter...

282
00:14:31,317 --> 00:14:32,608
...and I won't allow it.

283
00:14:32,692 --> 00:14:33,317
[IZUKU gasps]

284
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:34,817
[IZUKU]
Wait, what?

285
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:35,817
But yesterday you said--

286
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:37,650
I've thought about
it since then,

287
00:14:37,733 --> 00:14:39,900
and I've changed my mind.

288
00:14:39,983 --> 00:14:42,400
Izuku has admired
you for so long,

289
00:14:42,483 --> 00:14:45,358
even though he never
developed a Quirk as a kid.

290
00:14:45,442 --> 00:14:48,983
And then, miraculously,
one suddenly appeared.

291
00:14:49,067 --> 00:14:51,192
But ever since
enrolling at U.A.,

292
00:14:51,275 --> 00:14:54,150
my child just keeps
getting hurt.

293
00:14:54,233 --> 00:14:56,817
Just look at him.
Do you know about his arms?

294
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:58,358
If he injures them anymore,

295
00:14:58,442 --> 00:15:01,942
he might not ever be
able to move them again.

296
00:15:02,025 --> 00:15:05,858
I watched you on TV, and I
saw what that man did to you.

297
00:15:05,942 --> 00:15:09,358
As a regular citizen, I'm so
thankful for your bravery.

298
00:15:09,442 --> 00:15:13,150
But, as a mother,
I was terrified.

299
00:15:13,233 --> 00:15:16,067
Izuku wants to be just like you.

300
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:17,692
But if he follows your path,

301
00:15:17,775 --> 00:15:19,692
his future will be
filled with blood.

302
00:15:19,775 --> 00:15:21,358
So I'm sorry.

303
00:15:21,442 --> 00:15:22,733
Oh, help me!

304
00:15:22,817 --> 00:15:24,983
I am here!

305
00:15:25,067 --> 00:15:27,233
But he's my son.

306
00:15:27,317 --> 00:15:30,400
[IZUKU'S MOM]
I'm sorry.

307
00:15:30,483 --> 00:15:32,983
Forgive me, Izuku.

308
00:15:34,942 --> 00:15:36,483
[IZUKU'S MOM]
Back when you were Quirkless,

309
00:15:36,567 --> 00:15:37,858
you were always so happy

310
00:15:37,942 --> 00:15:40,900
just watching the
heroes do their jobs.

311
00:15:40,983 --> 00:15:44,900
Maybe it was better
that way. I don't know.

312
00:15:44,983 --> 00:15:46,233
That's not true!

313
00:15:46,317 --> 00:15:48,442
[IZUKU'S MOM] Honey,
I told you I'd support you,

314
00:15:48,525 --> 00:15:50,067
but that I wouldn't
stop worrying.

315
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:53,775
Do you remember that?

316
00:15:53,858 --> 00:15:59,567
And I know all you want is
to keep going to U.A., but...

317
00:15:59,650 --> 00:16:01,692
...I can't take it anymore.

318
00:16:04,025 --> 00:16:06,025
[IZUKU]
I shouldn't have been surprised.

319
00:16:06,108 --> 00:16:10,150
I'd been ignoring my mother's
feelings for so long.

320
00:16:10,233 --> 00:16:12,192
[IZUKU'S MOM]
I'll speak frankly, sir.

321
00:16:12,275 --> 00:16:14,567
As Izuku's mother,

322
00:16:14,650 --> 00:16:18,442
I don't have the nerves I'd
need to entrust my son to U.A.

323
00:16:18,525 --> 00:16:22,483
Not with everything that's
happened at your school.

324
00:16:22,567 --> 00:16:25,358
It doesn't matter what a
wonderful hero you are.

325
00:16:25,442 --> 00:16:28,358
When the villains attacked,
every class had to be canceled.

326
00:16:28,442 --> 00:16:29,942
And you couldn't
stop your students

327
00:16:30,025 --> 00:16:32,900
from getting seriously
injured, almost killed.

328
00:16:32,983 --> 00:16:34,775
I won't put my son in danger.

329
00:16:34,858 --> 00:16:38,858
It's my duty as his
mother to keep him safe.

330
00:16:38,942 --> 00:16:39,775
Ma'am.

331
00:16:39,858 --> 00:16:41,108
[IZUKU]
It's not like that, Mom!

332
00:16:41,192 --> 00:16:43,233
It's my own fault that
I keep getting hurt.

333
00:16:43,317 --> 00:16:46,900
The teachers warned me over and
over again, but I didn't listen.

334
00:16:46,983 --> 00:16:48,733
So you're saying
you didn't learn?

335
00:16:48,817 --> 00:16:51,692
Don't you think that means
the school's responsible?

336
00:16:52,733 --> 00:16:55,442
Young man, sit down.

337
00:16:55,525 --> 00:16:58,067
[IZUKU'S MOM] I might be acting
like an overprotective parent,

338
00:16:58,150 --> 00:16:59,650
but I'm at peace with that.

339
00:16:59,733 --> 00:17:03,608
And while I don't want to steal
my son's dream away from him,

340
00:17:03,692 --> 00:17:06,400
he can always go to
a different school.

341
00:17:06,483 --> 00:17:08,442
There are lots of other
hero courses out there

342
00:17:08,525 --> 00:17:10,608
besides the one at U.A.

343
00:17:15,233 --> 00:17:16,608
Izuku!

344
00:17:18,483 --> 00:17:20,442
[ALL MIGHT]
This must be heartbreaking.

345
00:17:20,525 --> 00:17:24,025
You looked up to me.
Followed in my footsteps.

346
00:17:24,108 --> 00:17:27,025
I know what it means to you
to study at my Alma Mater.

347
00:17:27,108 --> 00:17:30,192
And to give it all up
after working so hard...

348
00:17:30,275 --> 00:17:33,233
I'm sorry. I'll go talk to him.

349
00:17:34,525 --> 00:17:37,775
Mom, it doesn't have to be U.A!

350
00:17:37,858 --> 00:17:40,650
Here. Look at this.
You, too, All Might.

351
00:17:40,733 --> 00:17:42,483
I got a letter at the hospital.

352
00:17:42,567 --> 00:17:45,733
It's from the boy I saved
at the training camp.

353
00:17:45,817 --> 00:17:48,775
Kota, someone who hated
heroes and Quirks,

354
00:17:48,858 --> 00:17:51,400
wrote to thank me
for saving him.

355
00:17:51,483 --> 00:17:54,567
I know I'm hopeless and
make you worry all the time.

356
00:17:54,650 --> 00:17:56,067
But still.

357
00:17:56,150 --> 00:17:59,358
When I read this note, even
if it was just for a moment,

358
00:17:59,442 --> 00:18:03,192
it made me feel
like a real hero.

359
00:18:03,275 --> 00:18:05,442
I was so happy.

360
00:18:07,025 --> 00:18:09,317
[ALL MIGHT]
I see.

361
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:13,108
I know who I'm meant to be,
and that's what I'll train for.

You are on your own

As your teacher,
I must walk beside you.

[ALL MIGHT] I'm afraid I
haven't been upfront, ma'am.

Please allow me to try again.

I believe that Young Izuku is
the right person to succeed me.

[ALL MIGHT]
It's an apology.

As the one who held that title,

379
00:18:58,858 --> 00:19:01,025
I allowed myself
to remain his hero

rather than giving my
all as his teacher.

to forgive my past weakness.

It's true that my path
has been filled with blood,

but that is what makes
me the right person

to help him find his own way.

Free of the mistakes that
I made as a young hero.

Do you think I can
be a hero, too?

The struggle I put up
was truly pitiful.

But it is you who
failed in the end.

422
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:48,650
Beating me put you on a course

that led you closer
to your students.

You missed your
opportunity to vanish.

You lost your chance to die.

426
00:22:57,275 --> 00:23:02,067
A teacher's job is to help his
student become independent.

427
00:23:02,150 --> 00:23:04,192
When a student
relies on a master,

and that master disappears,

429
00:23:06,317 --> 00:23:08,483
the student's hatred grows,

path of a true leader.
