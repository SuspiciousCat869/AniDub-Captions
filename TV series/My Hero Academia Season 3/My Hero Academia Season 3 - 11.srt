The weak embers inside
you are resisting.

315
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,416
Trying to rekindle some
of your former strength.

316
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:36,708
A desperate attempt to rage
against the inevitable,

317
00:16:36,791 --> 00:16:39,291
and fulfill your duty.

318
00:16:39,375 --> 00:16:41,375
But it's not enough.

[ALL MIGHT] I'll beat you,
not because I'm a symbol,

323
00:16:57,708 --> 00:17:01,166
but because I will do
as my master did for me.

324
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:04,666
Until I finish training

how much you're resisting.

Use your wits!

[GRAN TORINO]
At the last moment,

333
00:17:28,291 --> 00:17:31,416
he transferred the power
in his right arm to his left.

334
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:34,083
He used his right arm as bait!

335
00:17:34,166 --> 00:17:35,583
But...

336
00:17:35,666 --> 00:17:40,375
[ALL FOR ONE] A clever trick.
That's so unlike you.

00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,541
put my back into it that time!

341
00:17:50,625 --> 00:17:54,291

He's knocked out!
All Might stands victorious!

He shouldn't push himself.

There!

Let's just head that way.

[IZUKU] All Might's message
was only a few words long.

390
00:21:18,708 --> 00:21:21,208
As far as most people
were concerned,

391
00:21:21,291 --> 00:21:23,750
it was meant for
other criminals.

392
00:21:23,833 --> 00:21:27,708
A warning that the
Symbol of Peace endured.

393
00:21:27,791 --> 00:21:31,583
But, to me, it meant
the opposite.

394
00:21:35,625 --> 00:21:38,083
[IZUKU]
He'd used up everything.

395
00:21:38,166 --> 00:21:40,416
And now it was left to me.

396
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:31,083

Now, the preview!

397

his greatest nemesis.

399

But he's not able
to fight anymore.

has retired.

I'll be the one to
take over One for All

leaving behind!

405
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,541
"End of the Beginning,
Beginning of the End."

406
00:23:50,625 --> 00:23:52,958
Mom, no matter how
worried you are,

407
00:23:53,041 --> 00:23:55,083
I'll still become a hero!

408
00:23:55,166 --> 00:23:57,625
Go beyond! Plus Ultra!
