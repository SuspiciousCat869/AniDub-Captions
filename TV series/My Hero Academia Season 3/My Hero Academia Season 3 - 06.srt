00:00:10,333 --> 00:00:13,000
[IZUKU] Welcome to UA High,
the prestigious school

2
00:00:13,083 --> 00:00:16,125
that's turned out some of
the world's greatest heroes.

3
00:00:16,208 --> 00:00:18,208
I'm running toward
my dream in these halls.

4
00:00:18,291 --> 00:00:20,375
Learning to overcome
obstacles and save people

5
00:00:20,458 --> 00:00:22,791
with a smile on my face.

6
00:00:22,875 --> 00:00:25,916
That's how I'll become the
greatest hero in the world!

7
00:02:04,041 --> 00:02:05,625
[IZUKU]
Kacchan and Todoroki went second

8
00:02:05,708 --> 00:02:07,000
in the test of courage.

9
00:02:07,083 --> 00:02:08,750
If they didn't go
back to camp yet,

10
00:02:08,833 --> 00:02:10,916
then they might
still be around here.

11
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,083
[gasps]

12
00:02:12,958 --> 00:02:14,791
[yells]

13
00:02:19,583 --> 00:02:20,416
[gasps]

14
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:23,708
[IZUKU]
Shoji. What happened--?

15
00:02:23,791 --> 00:02:25,333
[SHOJI]
With those injuries...

16
00:02:25,416 --> 00:02:28,250
You should be laid up
in bed recovering.

17
00:02:28,333 --> 00:02:30,125
But you wanna save your friend.

18
00:02:30,208 --> 00:02:31,875
No matter what the cost.

19
00:02:31,958 --> 00:02:33,666
That thing just now...

20
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:35,916
Wait. Don't tell me...

21
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,250
[SHOJI] Yeah. If we wanna
get through here,

22
00:02:39,333 --> 00:02:41,541
we'll have to face
Dark Shadow first.

23
00:02:41,625 --> 00:02:45,166
[DARK SHADOW roars]

24
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:48,916
Stay away from me! You'll die!

25
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,250
[gasps]

26
00:02:50,333 --> 00:02:51,791
Tokoyami, no!

27
00:02:56,291 --> 00:02:58,583
[IZUKU]
But... How did he get this way?

28
00:02:58,666 --> 00:02:59,833
[SHOJI]
Keep it down.

29
00:02:59,916 --> 00:03:01,541
After Mandalay told us
what was happening

30
00:03:01,625 --> 00:03:05,791
and that we shouldn't engage,
we were both on high alert.

31
00:03:05,875 --> 00:03:08,416
Still, one of the villains
got the drop on us.

32
00:03:11,916 --> 00:03:13,625
[TOKOYAMI]
Shoji!

33
00:03:13,708 --> 00:03:16,458
[SHOJI] I hid in the bushes
and tried to cover Tokoyami,

34
00:03:16,541 --> 00:03:18,000
even though one of
my arms was cut off.

35
00:03:18,083 --> 00:03:19,250
Really?

36
00:03:19,333 --> 00:03:20,708
[SHOJI]
It looks bad.

37
00:03:20,791 --> 00:03:23,166
But it's not like
it's lost forever.

38
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:24,875
My Dupli-Arms are
capable of making

39
00:03:24,958 --> 00:03:29,750
duplicates upon duplicates.
One of those was cut off.

40
00:03:29,833 --> 00:03:31,208
Thing is,

41
00:03:31,291 --> 00:03:33,958
he couldn't stand seeing
me injured like that.

42
00:03:34,041 --> 00:03:38,125
The Quirk he'd been suppressing
began to rage and take over.

43
00:03:38,208 --> 00:03:41,791
[DARK SHADOW roars]

44
00:03:41,875 --> 00:03:44,958
The darker it is, the less
control Tokoyami has.

45
00:03:45,041 --> 00:03:48,208
I had no idea his Quirk
could explode like this.

46
00:03:48,291 --> 00:03:49,500
[SHOJI]
It's probably fueled by

47
00:03:49,583 --> 00:03:51,541
his righteous
indignation and regret.

48
00:03:51,625 --> 00:03:55,416
He's tried to hold it back,
but they made it wilder.

49
00:03:57,916 --> 00:04:00,500
[SHOJI] It started lunging
at any sound or movement,

50
00:04:00,583 --> 00:04:04,000
a beast lashing out with
indiscriminate attacks.

51
00:04:04,083 --> 00:04:05,791
Forget about me.

52
00:04:05,875 --> 00:04:08,833
Go! Find our classmates.

53
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:11,708
Help them instead.

54
00:04:11,791 --> 00:04:14,833
Stop this. Calm down,
Dark Shadow!

55
00:04:14,916 --> 00:04:17,000
[SHOJI] His Quirk has
a weakness to light.

56
00:04:17,083 --> 00:04:19,750
If we can lead them to
a fire or back to camp,

57
00:04:19,833 --> 00:04:21,791
we can contain it.

58
00:04:21,875 --> 00:04:23,166
Midoriya.

59
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:25,583
I know these are
strange circumstances,

60
00:04:25,666 --> 00:04:28,958
but I can't just leave
a suffering friend behind.

61
00:04:29,041 --> 00:04:31,041
You forced your broken
body to get you here

62
00:04:31,125 --> 00:04:33,458
because you were
worried about Bakugo.

63
00:04:33,541 --> 00:04:35,541
If you still wanna save him,

64
00:04:35,625 --> 00:04:37,541
I'll distract
Dark Shadow for you.

65
00:04:37,625 --> 00:04:38,583
And you can run.

66
00:04:38,666 --> 00:04:40,541
[gasps] Hold on.

67
00:04:40,625 --> 00:04:43,041
The fire and camp are
both pretty far away.

68
00:04:43,125 --> 00:04:44,583
You'll be in danger if he--

69
00:04:45,791 --> 00:04:47,000
[SHOJI]
I know that.

70
00:04:47,083 --> 00:04:49,791
But to save people,
you have to take risks.

71
00:04:49,875 --> 00:04:52,500
That's what makes
a hero, a hero.

72
00:04:54,375 --> 00:04:56,916
[SHOJI] Will you stay with
me and help Tokoyami?

73
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,333
Or will you rush
to Bakugo's side?

74
00:04:59,416 --> 00:05:02,541
You have to make
a choice. Right now.

75
00:05:06,791 --> 00:05:08,583
[IZUKU]
I already have.

76
00:05:09,625 --> 00:05:14,250
Flesh. Pieces of meat!

77
00:05:14,333 --> 00:05:16,916
Flesh!

78
00:05:21,875 --> 00:05:23,625
[KATSUKI]
Teeth attacks? Seriously?

79
00:05:23,708 --> 00:05:25,583
It's time to blast this freak
with everything I've got!

80
00:05:25,666 --> 00:05:26,750
[TODOROKI]
You can't!

81
00:05:26,833 --> 00:05:27,750
[KATSUKI]
If the trees burn,

82
00:05:27,833 --> 00:05:29,208
just cover them
with ice, stupid.

83
00:05:29,291 --> 00:05:31,833
A big explosion will
impair my vision, though.

84
00:05:31,916 --> 00:05:33,916
I may not be able
to see the fire.

85
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,416
And how are you gonna
get close to him anyway?

86
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,166
[KATSUKI growls]

87
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:44,833
[IZUKU] There. I see ice!
They're fighting!

88
00:05:44,916 --> 00:05:46,708
Uh?

89
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:51,250
[SHOJI]
Bakugo! Todoroki!

90
00:05:51,333 --> 00:05:53,000
One of you. Give us some light!

91
00:05:53,083 --> 00:05:54,916
[MOONFISH]
More flesh!

92
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,958
[DARK SHADOW roars]

93
00:05:59,875 --> 00:06:01,208
[BOTH gasp]

94
00:06:02,583 --> 00:06:04,125
[screams]

95
00:06:04,208 --> 00:06:06,375
[IZUKU]
Shoji. I have a plan.

96
00:06:06,458 --> 00:06:09,000
It's not perfect,
but it might work.

97
00:06:09,083 --> 00:06:10,083
[SHOJI]
What?

98
00:06:10,166 --> 00:06:12,333
[IZUKU]
If Dark Shadow reacts to sound,

99
00:06:12,416 --> 00:06:14,583
then make duplicate
arms to bait him,

100
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:18,833
so he'll follow us without
attacking our actual bodies.

101
00:06:18,916 --> 00:06:21,166
We can lead Dark
Shadow to Kacchan.

102
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:24,125
He'll be able to weaken
him with an explosion.

103
00:06:24,208 --> 00:06:26,291
I don't want to choose
one or the other.

104
00:06:26,375 --> 00:06:28,208
I want to save them both!

105
00:06:29,833 --> 00:06:31,083
Kacchan!

106
00:06:32,166 --> 00:06:33,958
[TODOROKI]
Shoji and Midoriya.

107
00:06:34,041 --> 00:06:35,875
And is that... Tokoyami?

108
00:06:35,958 --> 00:06:37,375
[DARK SHADOW roars]

109
00:06:37,458 --> 00:06:38,833
We need some light now.

110
00:06:38,916 --> 00:06:40,541
He's out of control!

111
00:06:41,708 --> 00:06:43,083
He's attacking blindly.

112
00:06:43,166 --> 00:06:44,291
I'll use my fire.

113
00:06:44,375 --> 00:06:46,708
[KATSUKI]
Not so fast.

114
00:06:46,791 --> 00:06:50,541
[MOONFISH]
Flesh. Slabs of meat.

115
00:06:50,625 --> 00:06:53,458
No good. Can't allow it.

116
00:06:53,541 --> 00:06:57,291
I'm the one who gets
to slice them open.

117
00:06:57,375 --> 00:07:00,500
Don't steal from me!

118
00:07:01,625 --> 00:07:05,625
[DARK SHADOW] You don't
matter. Insignificant bug!

119
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:10,125
Now, finish him.

120
00:07:10,208 --> 00:07:12,666
[DARK SHADOW roars]

121
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:26,125
[DARK SHADOW growls]
Not enough! It's not enough!

122
00:07:26,208 --> 00:07:27,750
[DARK SHADOW squeaks]

123
00:07:31,166 --> 00:07:35,416
[TOKOYAMI pants]

124
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:37,583
And once again,

125
00:07:37,666 --> 00:07:40,625
I'm a terrible matchup
for you, birdboy.

126
00:07:40,708 --> 00:07:43,250
Thanks. You saved me.

127
00:07:45,416 --> 00:07:47,250
[TODOROKI] We could barely
defend against that guy,

128
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:49,458
but you beat him instantly.

129
00:07:49,541 --> 00:07:52,208
[SHOJI]
My friend. Are you okay?

130
00:07:52,291 --> 00:07:53,875
You did what we needed you to.

131
00:07:53,958 --> 00:07:56,416
Good, Tokoyami!
Don't fight against it!

132
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:57,666
Give up your control for now

133
00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:00,375
and just let it
take over--trust me!

134
00:08:00,458 --> 00:08:03,166
[TOKOYAMI]
Shoji. I apologize.

135
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:07,750
You, too, Midoriya.
I'm still far too immature.

136
00:08:07,833 --> 00:08:09,375
Anger consumed me.

137
00:08:09,458 --> 00:08:12,250
And I let my Quirk take over.

138
00:08:12,333 --> 00:08:15,916
The influence of the darkness,
combined with my fury,

139
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,583
spurred Dark Shadow
into a frenzy.

140
00:08:18,666 --> 00:08:19,791
Until...

141
00:08:19,875 --> 00:08:21,583
...it got so strong,
I couldn't contain it.

142
00:08:21,666 --> 00:08:24,750
And I ended up hurting Shoji.

143
00:08:24,833 --> 00:08:27,208
[SHOJI]
We'll deal with that later.

144
00:08:27,291 --> 00:08:29,708
That's what you'd say if
our roles were reversed.

145
00:08:29,791 --> 00:08:30,708
[gasps]

146
00:08:30,791 --> 00:08:32,083
[laughs]

147
00:08:35,208 --> 00:08:36,166
Okay.

148
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:37,541
I don't know if
you heard Mandalay,

149
00:08:37,625 --> 00:08:40,000
but I found out the
villains are after Kacchan.

150
00:08:40,083 --> 00:08:42,791
[TOKOYAMI] Bakugo?
Are they trying to kill him?

151
00:08:42,875 --> 00:08:43,875
Why?

152
00:08:43,958 --> 00:08:45,125
I'm not sure.

153
00:08:45,208 --> 00:08:47,041
But I think we
should get to camp.

154
00:08:47,125 --> 00:08:49,375
It's the safest place now,
so long as Vlad King

155
00:08:49,458 --> 00:08:51,416
and Mr. Aizawa have
regrouped there.

156
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:52,958
I understand.

157
00:08:53,041 --> 00:08:55,291
So our mission is to get
Bakugo back to safety

158
00:08:55,375 --> 00:08:57,250
by serving as his protectors.

159
00:08:57,333 --> 00:08:58,875
[IZUKU] It's possible
the Pussycats are still

160
00:08:58,958 --> 00:09:00,500
fighting in the clearing.

161
00:09:00,583 --> 00:09:02,791
Going that way would draw
the attention of the villains.

162
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:06,000
Plus, it's longer.
We should cut straight across.

163

[TOKOYAMI] We don't know
how many enemies there are.

164
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,875
We might come across
some by chance.

165
00:09:09,958 --> 00:09:12,000
[IZUKU] We can use
Shoji's search ability.

166
00:09:12,083 --> 00:09:14,416
And Todoroki's freezing power.

167
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:17,833
And, if Tokoyami's okay with it,
we can always use Dark Shadow

168
00:09:17,916 --> 00:09:19,875
now that we can
actually control him.

169
00:09:23,583 --> 00:09:25,875
Honestly, with a
group like this,

170
00:09:25,958 --> 00:09:29,000
we could probably even
go up against All Might.

171
00:09:29,083 --> 00:09:30,750
I'd be fine by myself!

172

We'll surround you as we walk.

We'll get everyone back safely.

If we can do that,
that's all that matters.

[TSUYU]
Ochaco, is your arm okay?

182
00:10:04,208 --> 00:10:06,666
Yeah, I'm fine.
It's just a scratch.

How does she know who we are?

Maybe from the sports fest?

192
00:10:26,875 --> 00:10:29,916
We know nothing about her,
so we're at a disadvantage.

There's not enough blood.

Normally I'd suck it
directly from the cut

but there's no time.

Don't worry, girls.

This machine will

When your opponent has a knife,

00:11:39,541 --> 00:11:42,458
pivot on one foot to disappear
from their line of sight.

[OCHACO]
What is with her?

251
00:12:35,458 --> 00:12:37,125
At first you try
to model yourself

252
00:12:37,208 --> 00:12:38,708
after the person you want.

253

You start dressing like them.

Thing is, that's not enough.

255
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:44,416
You have to go further.

256
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:48,375
Then, you realize you actually
want to become that person.

257

And once you get to that point,
there's no going back.

That's how love works right?

If you're monologuing

A bad habit of mine.

I was once an
entertainer, you know.

329

easily and violently,

You're the pain. Forgive me.

This place was supposed
to be hard to find

00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:43,958
because of the wall of
flames and poisonous gas.

No problem. Bow before me!

00:21:33,291 --> 00:21:36,791
[TOGA giggles] Yeah, but I made
some great new friends.

478
00:21:36,875 --> 00:21:39,000
And I found a cute boy
I'm interested in!

479
00:21:39,083 --> 00:21:41,291
[TWICE]
Is it me? No thanks, babe.

480
00:21:41,375 --> 00:21:42,875
I love you, too!

481
00:21:42,958 --> 00:21:44,291
Both of you. Shut it.

482
00:21:44,375 --> 00:21:45,833
You're too loud.

483
00:21:47,708 --> 00:21:49,208
[MR. COMPRESS yells]

484
00:21:51,416 --> 00:21:53,166
[TWICE]
Whoa, whoa, what's this?

485
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:55,583
Oh, hey, wait,
I know these kids.

486
00:21:56,625 --> 00:21:58,125
[TWICE]
Who are they?

487
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:30,791
[IZUKU]
Here's the preview!

488
00:23:30,875 --> 00:23:32,958
Thanks to Uraraka
and Asui's help,

489
00:23:33,041 --> 00:23:35,500
we've finally caught up to
the League of Villains.

490
00:23:35,583 --> 00:23:38,791
But now they've managed to
kidnap Tokoyami and Kacchan!

491
00:23:38,875 --> 00:23:41,250
What kind of magic is this?!

492
00:23:41,333 --> 00:23:45,375
Todoroki... Shoji...
we have to save our friends.

493
00:23:45,458 --> 00:23:48,083
It's our duty as
fledgling heroes!

494
00:23:48,166 --> 00:23:50,666
Next time: "What a Twist!"

495
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:53,541
We'll use everything we've
learned at UA up until now.

496
00:23:53,625 --> 00:23:55,333
It's our only way to win!

497
00:23:55,416 --> 00:23:57,958
Go beyond! Plus Ultra!
