[IZUKU] Welcome to UA High,
the prestigious school

00:00:13,083 --> 00:00:16,125
that's turned out some of
the world's greatest heroes.

00:00:16,208 --> 00:00:18,250
I'm running toward my
dream in these halls.

obstacles and save people

00:00:22,958 --> 00:00:25,916
That's how I'll become the
greatest hero in the world!

7
00:02:00,041 --> 00:02:02,166
[IZUKU] The provisional
licensing exam is upon us

8
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:04,041
and my classmates and I
are doing all we can

9
00:02:04,125 --> 00:02:06,000
to make it through
the first round.

[AIZAWA]
If you can pass this test

11
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:10,208
and get your
provisional licenses,

12
00:02:10,291 --> 00:02:12,541
then you novice eggs
will hatch into chicks.

13
00:02:12,625 --> 00:02:14,458
You'll be semi-pros.

14
00:02:15,541 --> 00:02:17,791
I expect your best.

15
00:02:17,875 --> 00:02:19,541
[IZUKU] This first test
is a free for all.

16
00:02:19,625 --> 00:02:21,791
Each of us has put three
targets on our bodies.

17
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:24,166
They can go anywhere,
as long as they're visible.

18
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:25,791
We've also each been
given six special balls

19
00:02:25,875 --> 00:02:27,541
that can trigger the spots.

20
00:02:27,625 --> 00:02:29,750
If all three of your targets
get hit, you're done.

21
00:02:29,833 --> 00:02:31,666
And only the first 100
people to get at least

22
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:34,916
two people out pass and
move on to the next round.

[MS JOKE] If you like
your class this year,

24
00:02:36,541 --> 00:02:39,416
then you should have warned
your students about all this.

25
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:42,583
We've seen it time and
time again in this exam.

26
00:02:42,666 --> 00:02:45,375

So you think we'll be taken out?

31
00:02:58,458 --> 00:03:01,375
I don't really see a reason
why I should've warned them.

32
00:03:01,458 --> 00:03:04,000
I doubt anything would've
changed if I had.

33
00:03:04,083 --> 00:03:06,916
They're still going to have
to overcome this either way.

34
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,625
Real heroes could turn
this situation around.

35
00:03:09,708 --> 00:03:12,166
Besides, if they become pros,
they'll face villains

36
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:14,000
who already know their Quirks.

37
00:03:14,083 --> 00:03:16,666
Perhaps at UA, we look
a little further ahead

38
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:18,375
than other schools.

[MS JOKE]
Hey, Eraser.

40
00:03:27,083 --> 00:03:28,541
I'm guessing a lot
of our kids will think

41
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:30,250
it's important to finish fast.

42
00:03:30,333 --> 00:03:32,875
Like the first ones to pass
will be ranked as the top.

43
00:03:32,958 --> 00:03:35,250
So they'll want to
attack. Immediately.

44
00:03:35,333 --> 00:03:37,750
Yes. But teamwork is the key.

45
00:03:37,833 --> 00:03:41,583
The wise ones will cooperate
and gather information together.

46
00:03:41,666 --> 00:03:43,291
But if they're seduced
by the urge to win

47
00:03:43,375 --> 00:03:47,333
and rush to get points, they'll
end up exposing themselves.

48
00:03:47,416 --> 00:03:49,375
And then it's all over.

49
00:03:49,458 --> 00:03:51,125
None of our attacks are landing.

50
00:03:51,208 --> 00:03:52,833
I guess we shouldn't
be surprised

51

00:08:12,916 --> 00:08:14,666
And all of you are
fighting with it.

161
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:16,000
Thank you!

162
00:08:16,083 --> 00:08:18,458
That's one of my favorite
things on Earth to see.

163
00:08:18,541 --> 00:08:20,625
[EXAMINEE 54C]
It's one guy from Shiketsu High?

164
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:22,541
[EXAMINEE 54D] What'd he say?
It's hard to hear.

165
00:08:22,625 --> 00:08:23,750
[EXAMINEE 54E]
Wait, what's he gonna do now

166
00:08:23,833 --> 00:08:25,958
that he's got our balls?

167
00:08:26,041 --> 00:08:30,791
Please let me join your fight
and show my own passion.

168
00:08:30,875 --> 00:08:34,333
I'm so looking forward to it!

169
00:08:38,416 --> 00:08:43,208
[EXAMINEES screaming]

170
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:46,916
Huh?

171
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,416
It's about time somebody
perked up and passed.

172
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,125
[yells]

173
00:08:51,208 --> 00:08:54,416
[MERA] What?! There were
120 people taken down?

174
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:58,250
A single person managed to
do that in just one attack?

175
00:08:58,333 --> 00:09:00,375
[sighs]

176
00:09:00,458 --> 00:09:03,208
That's the stuff. I won!

177
00:09:03,291 --> 00:09:05,833
[MERA] That actually surprised
me so much that I'm awake!

178
00:09:05,916 --> 00:09:08,375
I assume we'll see a lot of
people passing from now on.

179
00:09:08,458 --> 00:09:11,041
Everyone, let's get this out of
the way so I can take a break.

180
00:09:11,125 --> 00:09:12,625
Good? Good.

181
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:15,208
[IZUKU]
What a Quirk.

182
00:09:15,291 --> 00:09:18,416
Although it seems like it would
be hard to use in a city.

183
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:19,458
[gasps]

184
00:09:19,541 --> 00:09:21,666
[IZUKU]
Oh, no. We've been split up.

185
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:25,083
Is this what Ketsubutsu was
planning the entire time?

186
00:09:25,166 --> 00:09:28,250
I've gotta find everyone,
or at least somebody soon!

187
00:09:28,333 --> 00:09:30,375
If I'm alone, I'm done for.

188
00:09:30,458 --> 00:09:32,041
The other schools have
had so much more time

189
00:09:32,125 --> 00:09:34,958
to work together and learn
to make decisions in battle.

190
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:37,375
We're behind by a whole
year's worth of training,

191
00:09:37,458 --> 00:09:39,416
even with everything
we experienced.

192
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:40,916
[AIZAWA]
Inasa Yoarashi.

193
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,125
He's the same year
as you all and received

194
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:44,708
the top scores for
students admitted

195
00:09:44,791 --> 00:09:45,791
through recommendations.

196
00:09:45,875 --> 00:09:47,333
But for some unknown reason,

197
00:09:47,416 --> 00:09:50,291
he turned down his acceptance
to UA and went to Shiketsu.

198
00:09:50,375 --> 00:09:52,625
[IZUKU] If he had the top score
for those with recommendations,

199
00:09:52,708 --> 00:09:55,083
then he must be even
better than Todoroki!

200
00:09:55,166 --> 00:09:57,500
Today, I'm gonna do my
best to learn from you.

201
00:09:57,583 --> 00:09:58,958
I really hope you don't mind.

202
00:09:59,041 --> 00:10:01,125
Maximum force!

203
00:10:02,416 --> 00:10:05,125
[SHINDO]
Tremoring Earth!

204
00:10:06,583 --> 00:10:07,666
[IZUKU]
These are strong students

205
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:09,333
from all over the country.

206
00:10:09,416 --> 00:10:10,708
I don't know why,

207
00:10:10,791 --> 00:10:13,375
but I'm actually getting
pretty excited about this.

208
00:10:17,166 --> 00:10:20,583
[IZUKU] What? This girl
came outta nowhere!

209
00:10:20,666 --> 00:10:22,000
[CAMIE]
Tag, you're it.

210
00:10:22,083 --> 00:10:24,958
Not smart. Staring
off into space.

211
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:26,583
But... What's really weird

212
00:10:26,666 --> 00:10:29,500
is that you're in trouble
and still smiling.

213
00:10:29,583 --> 00:10:33,208
[IZUKU] I've seen her.
She's from Shiketsu High School.

214
00:10:33,291 --> 00:10:36,125
[laughs] You couldn't be cooler.

215
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:52,458
[OCHACO]
Wow, that was super intense.

216
00:10:52,541 --> 00:10:56,166
Someone could have even
died in that attack.

217
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:57,625
If I call out to the others,

218
00:10:57,708 --> 00:11:00,333
I'll just become a target
for the rest of the schools.

219
00:11:00,416 --> 00:11:02,791
My classmates shouldn't
be too far away, though.

220
00:11:02,875 --> 00:11:04,041
I need to find them.

221
00:11:04,125 --> 00:11:06,541
Otherwise, I'll have
to fight by myself.

222
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:09,708
In moments like this, you
have to be calm and careful.

223
00:11:09,791 --> 00:11:12,291
It's time for Sneak Uravity.

224
00:11:12,375 --> 00:11:14,416
[CAMIE] In fights where
a lot of one-on-one combat

225
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:16,833
is expected, most people
tend to go after

226
00:11:16,916 --> 00:11:19,083
opponents they've already
got a lot of intel on,

227
00:11:19,166 --> 00:11:20,250
since it's safest.

228
00:11:20,333 --> 00:11:21,708
That's why I tracked you down,

229
00:11:21,791 --> 00:11:24,125
because there's the good
possibility that UA's students

230
00:11:24,208 --> 00:11:25,750
will be ganged up on.

231
00:11:25,833 --> 00:11:27,791
See, I didn't wanna miss
the chance to interact

232
00:11:27,875 --> 00:11:29,250
with such a prestigious school,

233
00:11:29,333 --> 00:11:31,541
and I've taken quite
an interest in you.

234
00:11:31,625 --> 00:11:34,958
Huh. You sure like to talk.

235
00:11:35,041 --> 00:11:36,625
[IZUKU]
Ketsubutsu Academy will show up

236
00:11:36,708 --> 00:11:38,208
to fight any second now.

237
00:11:38,291 --> 00:11:40,500
This is no time for
a leisurely chat.

238
00:11:40,583 --> 00:11:44,041
But I'm sure she
understands that.

239
00:11:44,125 --> 00:11:46,333
Does she have teammates
coming to help her?

240
00:11:46,416 --> 00:11:48,375
Or is she just
that overconfident?

241
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:50,875
[IZUKU]
Doesn't matter.

242
00:11:50,958 --> 00:11:52,791
I've gotta make sure
I don't get taken out.

243
00:11:52,875 --> 00:11:54,000
[gasps]

244
00:11:54,083 --> 00:11:56,000
[IZUKU] Where'd she go?
She couldn't have--

245
00:11:56,083 --> 00:11:57,750
All I have to do is
tap you with a ball

246
00:11:57,833 --> 00:11:59,208
and that makes two.

247
00:12:00,666 --> 00:12:03,750
[IZUKU]
No way. Gotta counterattack!

248
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:07,458
[IZUKU]
Or not. She's gone.

249
00:12:07,541 --> 00:12:10,833
Oh. You think my Quirk
lets me disappear?

250
00:12:10,916 --> 00:12:11,875
No--!

251
00:12:13,583 --> 00:12:16,041
[CAMIE] That's not it.
I was just hiding.

252
00:12:16,125 --> 00:12:17,666
It wasn't your power at work?

253
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:20,208
Nope. That's just a technique.

254
00:12:20,291 --> 00:12:22,375
I make my opponent's
eyes and ears blind

255
00:12:22,458 --> 00:12:24,208
and deaf to my presence.

256
00:12:24,291 --> 00:12:25,458
To do that,

257
00:12:25,541 --> 00:12:28,083
I hold my breath, clear
my mind, and disappear.

258
00:12:28,166 --> 00:12:29,666
It's simple.

259
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:31,916
The hardest part is not
thinking, to be honest.

260
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,291
[IZUKU]
Wait.

261
00:12:33,375 --> 00:12:35,208
You learned a technique that
impressive at Shiketsu?

262
00:12:35,291 --> 00:12:37,083
[CAMIE] The trick is to
not view your training

263
00:12:37,166 --> 00:12:38,666
as some kind of chore.

264
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:42,000
[CAMIE chuckles] I'm glad we're
learning about each other.

265
00:12:42,083 --> 00:12:43,541
Now, my question.

266
00:12:43,625 --> 00:12:46,666
Why exactly do you
wanna become a hero?

267
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:47,875
For honor? Pride?

268
00:12:47,958 --> 00:12:50,291
Or is it someone else's sake?

269
00:12:50,375 --> 00:12:53,708
I wanna know your deepest
desires, and what scares you.

270
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:06,333
[TOTEKI] Man. Shiketsu's trying
to take him down, too?

271
00:13:07,958 --> 00:13:09,500
Not good.

272
00:13:09,583 --> 00:13:10,750
[IZUKU]
I'm trapped.

273
00:13:10,833 --> 00:13:13,291
I couldn't find anyone,
and now I'm the target.

274
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:15,250
The worst-case-scenario
I thought of earlier

275
00:13:15,333 --> 00:13:17,875
is now a reality!

276
00:13:17,958 --> 00:13:20,333
This is it. Here they come.

277
00:13:20,416 --> 00:13:21,416
Dodge!

278
00:13:22,625 --> 00:13:25,041
[IZUKU]
Dodge! Dodge!

279
00:13:25,125 --> 00:13:27,166
Just keep avoiding them!

280
00:13:28,375 --> 00:13:29,291
[OCHACO]
Are you okay?

281
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:30,833
[gasps] Uraraka!

282
00:13:30,916 --> 00:13:32,708
Over here. Hurry!

283
00:13:32,791 --> 00:13:34,708
[IZUKU]
What? Does she have a plan?

284
00:13:34,791 --> 00:13:36,416
[SHIKETSU BOY 54B]
Don't let them escape!

285
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:38,958
Hey, watch where
you're shooting.

286
00:13:40,791 --> 00:13:42,166
[SHIKETSU BOY 54B]
I'll take her down fast.

287
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:43,541
[SHIKETSU BOY 54C]
No, wait!

288
00:13:45,333 --> 00:13:49,125
[IZUKU] Back then, I chose
to fight and save someone,

289
00:13:49,208 --> 00:13:51,250
which destroyed my arms.

290
00:13:51,333 --> 00:13:52,791
If I could've used them,

291
00:13:52,875 --> 00:13:56,166
then I might have been
able to save Kacchan.

292
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:58,250
And if Kacchan was never taken,

293
00:13:58,333 --> 00:13:59,791
then All Might would
never have had to fight

294
00:13:59,875 --> 00:14:02,125
against All For One
at the warehouse.

295
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:03,958
If I had only been faster...

296
00:14:04,041 --> 00:14:06,958
I should have been able to get
Kota to Mr. Aizawa sooner.

297
00:14:07,041 --> 00:14:09,708
And then I could have gone
after the villains myself.

298
00:14:10,541 --> 00:14:12,625
[IZUKU] That's why I have
to train my legs now.

299
00:14:12,708 --> 00:14:15,666
So that I never fail to
save anyone ever again.

300
00:14:16,791 --> 00:14:17,916
An opening!

301
00:14:19,416 --> 00:14:21,625
[IZUKU] Because to help others,
you have to be able

302
00:14:21,708 --> 00:14:23,500
to take care of yourself.

303
00:14:29,291 --> 00:14:30,458
[SHIKETSU BOY 54C]
Dammit! The whole mountain's

304
00:14:30,541 --> 00:14:31,583
coming down!

305
00:14:31,666 --> 00:14:33,291
[SHIKETSU STUDENTS scream]

306
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:36,458
[ALL MIGHT]
I dunno. Based on that kick,

307
00:14:36,541 --> 00:14:38,666
I'd say you're further
along than you think.

308
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:41,583
So, you should be
ready for this test.

309
00:14:41,666 --> 00:14:44,041
[IZUKU]
It's just like All Might said!

310
00:14:44,125 --> 00:14:46,375
Until my body is able
to catch up to my Quirk,

311
00:14:46,458 --> 00:14:49,083
I won't use One For All
at 100 percent.

312
00:14:49,166 --> 00:14:51,041
Instead, I'll work on my legs.

313
00:14:51,125 --> 00:14:54,208
Thankfully, these new iron soles
create a powerful impact.

314
00:14:54,291 --> 00:14:58,125
And the toes spring back, so
it's basically two hits in one.

315
00:14:58,208 --> 00:15:01,625
This support item compensates
for my lack of power.

316
00:15:02,708 --> 00:15:05,666
[IZUKU] I'll make myself
stronger. I'll keep fighting!

317
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:08,583
And become the ideal
hero I want to be.

318
00:15:10,791 --> 00:15:15,250
[yawns] Well, we've finally
had a 30th person pass.

319
00:15:15,333 --> 00:15:17,583
Still a pretty long
way to go, though.

320
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:21,500
Can't you kids speed
this along? For me?

321
00:15:21,583 --> 00:15:23,625
[SHIKETSU BOY 54A] Where'd
those UA brats run off to?

322
00:15:23,708 --> 00:15:25,791
[SHIKETSU BOY 54B]
Are they gone? Or just hiding.

323
00:15:25,875 --> 00:15:27,333
[SHIKETSU BOY 54C]
They gotta be close.

324
00:15:27,416 --> 00:15:28,833
Anyway, this isn't working.

325
00:15:28,916 --> 00:15:31,000
There must be a better
way to tag them.

326
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:34,041
[IZUKU]
Anyone chasing us?

327
00:15:34,125 --> 00:15:37,041
No. Maybe they gave up.

328
00:15:37,125 --> 00:15:38,166
Thanks, sorry.

329
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:40,416
I really messed up
back there, huh?

330
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,416
[IZUKU]
No. That's not true.

331
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:43,916
You were outnumbered.

332
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:10,041
[IZUKU] Let me guess.
You're someone from Shiketsu?

333
00:16:10,125 --> 00:16:11,291
I'm what?

334
00:16:11,375 --> 00:16:13,291
[IZUKU] Uraraka has been
working on her Quirk.

335
00:16:13,375 --> 00:16:14,541
Training hard.

336
00:16:14,625 --> 00:16:16,541
She can even ignore its
side effects for a short

337
00:16:16,625 --> 00:16:18,375
period of time and use it
to make herself float

338
00:16:18,458 --> 00:16:19,583
without getting sick.

339
00:16:19,666 --> 00:16:21,958
But you. You haven't
tried to use it at all,

340
00:16:22,041 --> 00:16:24,166
even though you were in danger.

341
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:25,833
And even more suspicious.

342
00:16:25,916 --> 00:16:28,541
You exposed yourself to
the enemy without a plan.

343
00:16:28,625 --> 00:16:32,625
That's not like the Uraraka
I know. So who are you?

344
00:16:32,708 --> 00:16:35,041
[OCHACO chuckles]
If you saved me even though

345
00:16:35,125 --> 00:16:36,458
you knew I was a fake...

346
00:16:36,541 --> 00:16:39,208
...does that mean you were
trying to use me somehow?

347
00:16:39,291 --> 00:16:42,625
[gasps] No. I didn't have time
to think that far ahead.

348
00:16:42,708 --> 00:16:45,000
I'd do it again, though.
In a heartbeat.

349
00:16:45,083 --> 00:16:46,791
Because if you're not Uraraka,

350
00:16:46,875 --> 00:16:49,333
you couldn't have
floated away back there.

351
00:16:49,416 --> 00:16:50,708
Falling from that height,

352
00:16:50,791 --> 00:16:52,916
you definitely would've
injured yourself.

353
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,833
Oh? I see now.

354
00:16:54,916 --> 00:16:58,500
So you're just that
good of a guy, huh?

355
00:16:58,583 --> 00:17:02,250
Please, tell me more
about yourself. Everything.

356
00:17:03,375 --> 00:17:06,041
[IZUKU] Can't we talk
about this after the exam?

357
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:08,416
[CAMIE] Does that mean
you'll save anybody?

358
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:11,666
Is there no boundary?
Where do you draw the line?

359
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:13,375
[IZUKU] Holy whoa, what
happened to your clothes?

360
00:17:13,458 --> 00:17:15,000
You're basically naked!

361
00:17:15,083 --> 00:17:18,250
I'll get dressed when
my mission's complete.

362
00:17:18,333 --> 00:17:19,625
[IZUKU]
She scratched me?

363
00:17:19,708 --> 00:17:21,458
What's the matter
with this girl?

364
00:17:27,125 --> 00:17:28,416
[CAMIE]
What?

365
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:29,958
[IZUKU]
Tape?

366
00:17:30,041 --> 00:17:32,708
[SERO] Midoriya! What's this
enviable situation you're in?

367
00:17:32,791 --> 00:17:33,500
[IZUKU]
Sero!

368
00:17:33,583 --> 00:17:34,916
Uraraka!

369
00:17:36,125 --> 00:17:37,583
Release!

370
00:17:41,291 --> 00:17:42,833
[OCHACO]
Those reflexes!

371
00:17:45,833 --> 00:17:47,708
And here things were
just getting good.

372
00:17:47,791 --> 00:17:49,333
Too bad.

373
00:17:49,416 --> 00:17:55,250
I really, <i>really</i> ...
wanted to talk to you some more.

374
00:17:55,333 --> 00:18:00,166
But not with so many people
around. What a bummer.

375
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:02,416
Ochaco Uraraka.

376
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:04,708
He really trusts you
a lot, you know.

377
00:18:04,791 --> 00:18:06,041
Huh?

378
00:18:07,166 --> 00:18:08,333
[SERO]
Come back, naked girl!

379
00:18:08,416 --> 00:18:09,708
Don't follow her!

380
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:11,333
[SERO]
Aw, man, why not?

381
00:18:11,416 --> 00:18:12,625
[IZUKU]
It might've just been her Quirk,

382
00:18:12,708 --> 00:18:13,916
but it looked like
she wasn't wearing

383
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,166
her clothes or her targets.

384
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:18,166
There's still a chance
she might come after us.

385
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:20,416
But think about it, we
don't have much time left,

386
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:23,250
and it would be hard
to get a point off of her.

387
00:18:23,333 --> 00:18:26,208
Also... You two are
actually you, right?

388
00:18:26,291 --> 00:18:27,250
Huh?

389
00:18:27,333 --> 00:18:28,250
[SERO]
What are you talkin' about?

390
00:18:28,333 --> 00:18:30,333
Well, earlier, that girl

391
00:18:30,416 --> 00:18:32,916
transformed into
Uraraka's clone.

392
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,125
[BOTH yelp]

393
00:18:34,208 --> 00:18:36,000
[SERO] Was she naked
then, too, Midoriya?

394
00:18:36,083 --> 00:18:37,333
That's what you're
concerned about?

395
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:40,208
Of course not,
she had a costume on!

396
00:18:40,291 --> 00:18:41,500
[SERO]
So that hottie's Quirk

397
00:18:41,583 --> 00:18:44,458
is to transform into
other people. Weird.

398
00:18:44,541 --> 00:18:46,000
[IZUKU]
I think so.

399
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:48,041
[SERO] We can't underestimate
how much those other schools

400
00:18:48,125 --> 00:18:49,458
have learned about us.

401
00:18:49,541 --> 00:18:52,041
They even know you and Uraraka
are really good friends.

402
00:18:52,125 --> 00:18:53,541
[IZUKU] Probably because
we were on the same

403
00:18:53,625 --> 00:18:55,875
cavalry battle team
at the sports festival.

404
00:18:55,958 --> 00:18:57,916
[OCHACO]
Yeah, that must be why.

405
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,541
Anyway. How'd you guys find me?
It was perfect timing.

406
00:19:01,625 --> 00:19:04,125
[SERO] I just saw a fight
and rushed over to help.

407
00:19:04,208 --> 00:19:06,583
We ran into each other
along the way.

408
00:19:06,666 --> 00:19:08,375
[OCHACO]
I'm glad we got to help.

409
00:19:08,458 --> 00:19:09,666
Yeah, me, too.

410
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:12,416
So we're a trio
for now. What next?

411
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:14,791
[SERO] I wish we could meet up
with the rest of our class.

412
00:19:14,875 --> 00:19:16,583
We're way safer in numbers.

413
00:19:16,666 --> 00:19:18,041
That's true.

414
00:19:18,125 --> 00:19:20,833
But 30 people have already
passed this the test so far.

415
00:19:20,916 --> 00:19:22,208
We have to hurry.

416
00:19:22,291 --> 00:19:25,375
If we're gonna pass,
we've gotta earn some points.

417
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,708
[TODOROKI] The other schools
are sticking together,

418
00:19:28,791 --> 00:19:31,708
moving around in groups
of ten or more.

419
00:19:31,791 --> 00:19:34,125
I could attack one of them,
but there could be

420
00:19:34,208 --> 00:19:36,875
people with Quirks
I'm weak against.

421
00:19:36,958 --> 00:19:39,541
Ideally, the various teams
would fight each other,

422
00:19:39,625 --> 00:19:41,250
bringing the numbers
of each group down

423
00:19:41,333 --> 00:19:43,583
to something more manageable
for me to pick off.

424
00:19:43,666 --> 00:19:45,416
[MERA]
Let's see, where are we at now?

425
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:47,750
Things've been moving
a lot more quickly.

426
00:19:47,833 --> 00:19:51,833
Looks like 52--make
that 53 have passed.

427
00:19:51,916 --> 00:19:54,375
And, looking on the
other side of things.

428
00:19:54,458 --> 00:19:57,750
It seems 230 examinees
have failed.

429
00:19:57,833 --> 00:19:59,791
Less than half
the spots are open.

430
00:19:59,875 --> 00:20:02,791
Now's the time to move.
Don't dally, kids.

431
00:20:02,875 --> 00:20:05,375
[TODOROKI] I don't have the
luxury of waiting around.

432
00:20:14,125 --> 00:20:15,875
[SEIJIN STUDENT 54A]
That was pretty good!

433
00:20:15,958 --> 00:20:18,125
Just what I'd expect
from the runner up

434
00:20:18,208 --> 00:20:20,208
of the UA Sports Festival.

435
00:20:20,291 --> 00:20:22,083
The name's Todoroki, right?

436
00:20:22,166 --> 00:20:23,375
I can't believe you're out here

437
00:20:23,458 --> 00:20:25,791
wandering around
all by yourself.

438
00:20:25,875 --> 00:20:27,625
You must be really confident.

439
00:20:27,708 --> 00:20:29,375
[SEIJIN STUDENT 54B]
But even if he is from UA High,

440
00:20:29,458 --> 00:20:32,083
acting alone is just
asking for trouble.

441
00:20:32,166 --> 00:20:33,458
[SEIJIN STUDENT 54AA]
A ten-on-one fight.

He doesn't stand a chance.

This is great.

444
00:20:36,375 --> 00:20:38,583
Now I don't have
to find opponents.

Damn it! I can't move.

448
00:20:53,708 --> 00:20:55,166
You're surprised?

449
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:58,208
I thought you said you
watched the sports festival.

450

[SEIJIN STUDENT 54A]
Don't be cocky, we're prepared!

451
00:21:07,875 --> 00:21:09,875
[TODOROKI] Looks like a Quirk
that makes things bigger.

452
00:21:09,958 --> 00:21:12,208

not all I brought with me!

Should I use a big attack?

454

No, not yet. I'll wait
to see if there are more.

455

[TODOROKI]
Even if I couldn't melt it,

least made a mark!

Todoroki's targeted
by Seijin High School.
