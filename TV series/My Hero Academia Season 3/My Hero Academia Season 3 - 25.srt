1
00:00:09,875 --> 00:00:10,583
[AIZAWA] Morning. Now
that Midoriya is back,

2
00:00:10,666 --> 00:00:11,708
we'll go into more detail

3
00:00:11,791 --> 00:00:13,666
about what the
work studies entail.

4
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:15,333
Go ahead and come in.

5
00:00:17,083 --> 00:00:18,541
[AIZAWA] I'll have people
who've experienced

6
00:00:18,625 --> 00:00:21,333
them firsthand explain.

7
00:00:21,416 --> 00:00:23,500
I suggest you listen
carefully as they point out

8
00:00:23,583 --> 00:00:26,666
how work studies differ
from internships.

9
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:28,541
[gasps]

10
00:00:28,625 --> 00:00:30,916
[AIZAWA] These three
are third years at UA.

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
They rank at the very top
of our student body.

12
00:00:35,083 --> 00:00:38,500
You may know them
as the Big Three.

13
00:00:40,208 --> 00:00:43,000
The Big Three. And it's him.

14
00:02:18,416 --> 00:02:20,375
[SERO]
The best of the hero course.

15
00:02:20,458 --> 00:02:22,291
[KIRISHIMA]
The Big Three.

16
00:02:22,375 --> 00:02:24,041
Oh, wow!

17
00:02:24,125 --> 00:02:25,625
Of all the talented
students here,

18
00:02:25,708 --> 00:02:27,250
they're the ones at the top.

19
00:02:27,333 --> 00:02:28,625
They're on a different level.

20
00:02:28,708 --> 00:02:31,291
Still in school, but
practically pro heroes.

21
00:02:31,375 --> 00:02:32,791
If they're as good as I hear,

22
00:02:32,875 --> 00:02:35,208
then they're the students
we should be chasing after.

23
00:02:35,291 --> 00:02:37,583
They don't look all
that special to me.

24
00:02:37,666 --> 00:02:39,458
Except, the girl--
she's pretty hot.

25
00:02:39,541 --> 00:02:43,083
[MINETA] Target acquired.
Zoom and enhance.

26
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:47,041
[MINETA] Zoom, zoom,
zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom...

27
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:51,083
The guy from outside.
I can't believe it.

28
00:02:51,166 --> 00:02:52,500
I could only see
his face then,

29
00:02:52,583 --> 00:02:54,041
so I didn't recognize him.

30
00:02:54,125 --> 00:02:56,208
But I know who he is.

31
00:02:56,291 --> 00:02:58,666
He was in the sports festival
I watched from home last year.

32
00:02:58,750 --> 00:02:59,916
[gasps]

33
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,208
[IZUKU] He didn't do
very well, but he, uh,

34
00:03:02,291 --> 00:03:04,916
definitely left
a strong impression.

35
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,541
If I remember correctly,
the other two

36
00:03:06,625 --> 00:03:08,833
didn't take any
medals home, either.

37
00:03:08,916 --> 00:03:12,250
And, yet... They're
UA's Big Three.

38
00:03:12,333 --> 00:03:13,416
[IZUKU gulps]

39
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,583
[IZUKU] I wonder how
they got that title.

40
00:03:15,666 --> 00:03:18,708
[AIZAWA] Get to it.
Introduce yourselves briefly.

41
00:03:18,791 --> 00:03:21,041
Let's start with Amajiki.

42
00:03:22,208 --> 00:03:23,166
[STUDENTS gasp]

43
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:24,916
[KIRISHIMA]
What's with that look?

44
00:03:26,791 --> 00:03:29,666
[TENYA] So much intensity
in a single glance!

45
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:32,791
[TENYA screams]

46
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:37,750
[AMAJIKI]
It's no good.

47
00:03:37,833 --> 00:03:40,750
You two go. I just can't.

48
00:03:40,833 --> 00:03:43,666
Even if I try to imagine
them as potatoes,

49
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:46,625
I can see their human bodies.

50
00:03:46,708 --> 00:03:48,500
I know that they're
still people.

51
00:03:48,583 --> 00:03:50,166
No words are coming out.

52
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:53,250
My mind's blank and
my mouth is dry.

53
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:54,458
[TSUYU, TENYA, OCHACO]
Uh...

54
00:03:54,541 --> 00:03:59,375
I can't say anything.
I wanna... go home.

55
00:03:59,458 --> 00:04:00,541
[OJIRO, KAMINARI, ASHIDO gasp]

56
00:04:00,625 --> 00:04:02,291
Okay. So, um.

57
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:04,583
Are you really one
of UA's top heroes?

58
00:04:04,666 --> 00:04:06,875
[laughs] Come on, Amajiki!

59
00:04:06,958 --> 00:04:09,208
You need to have the heart
of a lion, not a kitten.

60
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:10,833
You know, even though
you're human.

61
00:04:10,916 --> 00:04:12,416
Get what I mean?

62
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:15,166
This is our kitten,
Tamaki Amajiki.

63
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:17,375
And, hi, my name is Nejire Hado.

64
00:04:17,458 --> 00:04:19,291
I'm supposed to talk
about work studies.

65
00:04:19,375 --> 00:04:22,583
You first-years have a really
exciting time ahead of you.

66
00:04:22,666 --> 00:04:23,708
Hey, wait, hold on.

67
00:04:23,791 --> 00:04:25,041
Why are you wearing a mask?

68
00:04:25,125 --> 00:04:26,583
Is it cuz you're feeling sick?

69
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:28,458
Or just... Trying to look cool.

70
00:04:28,541 --> 00:04:29,500
[SHOJI]
Uh. Well...

71
00:04:29,583 --> 00:04:30,583
Oh, whoa!

72
00:04:30,666 --> 00:04:32,500
And you must be
Todoroki, am I right?

73
00:04:32,583 --> 00:04:35,416
Yeah! How'd you get that
big burn on your face?

74
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:36,458
That's none of your--

75
00:04:36,541 --> 00:04:38,041
And, Ashido, if your
horns break off,

76
00:04:38,125 --> 00:04:40,666
you think you'll grow new ones?
Ooh, and can you wiggle them?

77
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:43,500
Mineta, are those balls your
hair, or what? I don't get it.

78
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:44,875
[MINETA]
My... balls?

79
00:04:44,958 --> 00:04:46,833
[HADO] Oh, oh, Asui,
you're a tree frog.

80
00:04:46,916 --> 00:04:48,958
Not a gross toad, right?

81
00:04:49,041 --> 00:04:50,416
Oh, my goodness!

82
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:51,833
There's so much I want to
know about every one of you.

83
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:53,375
Let's have a Q and A!

84
00:04:53,458 --> 00:04:57,291
Aw! She's a total
airhead. Even cuter!

85
00:04:57,375 --> 00:04:59,666
All those questions
make her sound so young.

86
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:02,125
She wants to know
everything about my balls!

87
00:05:02,208 --> 00:05:03,500
I'll spill my secrets.

88
00:05:03,583 --> 00:05:05,208
Come get up close and personal.

89
00:05:05,291 --> 00:05:06,583
Calm down.

90
00:05:06,666 --> 00:05:09,041
Hey, Ojiro, can you support
your entire body weight

91
00:05:09,125 --> 00:05:09,875
with that tail of yours?

92
00:05:09,958 --> 00:05:11,583
Um, well, ya see--

93
00:05:11,666 --> 00:05:14,750
[HADO] Come on, tell me,
I really wanna know.

94
00:05:14,833 --> 00:05:16,583
This is completely irrational.

95
00:05:16,666 --> 00:05:19,000
Oh, there's no need for
you to worry, Eraser Head.

96
00:05:19,083 --> 00:05:22,083
I'm up next, and I'll get
the audience refocused.

97
00:05:22,166 --> 00:05:24,333
The future's gonna be...?

98
00:05:26,125 --> 00:05:27,583
[KAMINARI]
Gonna be what?

99
00:05:27,666 --> 00:05:30,083
Awful! That's your part, guys!

100
00:05:30,166 --> 00:05:33,166
Oh, crap. My call and
response was a total fail.

101
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:35,333
Is it just me, or does it
seem like each one of them

102
00:05:35,416 --> 00:05:38,166
is a complete weirdo?
What's the deal?

103
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:40,125
Their strangeness is palpable.

104
00:05:40,208 --> 00:05:42,125
Okay, you guys look
like you have no idea

105
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:43,375
what's going on.

106
00:05:43,458 --> 00:05:44,875
I guess we are third years
who just showed up

107
00:05:44,958 --> 00:05:46,458
in your classroom
to explain a program

108
00:05:46,541 --> 00:05:47,958
that's completely voluntary.

109
00:05:48,041 --> 00:05:50,208
I can see how you'd
be confused by that.

110
00:05:50,291 --> 00:05:53,166
Hm. You guys got your
provisional licenses

111
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:56,166
as first years, right? Huh!

112
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:57,541
This batch of new
students has proven

113
00:05:57,625 --> 00:05:59,666
to be pretty darn energetic.

114
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:01,333
So the problem is,

115
00:06:01,416 --> 00:06:02,833
you must not have
a sense of humor.

116
00:06:02,916 --> 00:06:04,458
That's why my joke didn't land.

117

[gasps]

118
00:06:05,833 --> 00:06:07,541
Don't do it.

119
00:06:07,625 --> 00:06:09,916
Heads up, the rad new plan
is all you first-years

120
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,041
fight me at once.

121
00:06:11,125 --> 00:06:13,458
[STUDENTS]
Huh? Huh?!

122
00:06:13,541 --> 00:06:14,708
[KIRISHIMA]
You wanna fight us?

123

[SERO]
What, like, now?

124
00:06:16,333 --> 00:06:18,333
Well, if you want them to
experience our experience,

125
00:06:18,416 --> 00:06:20,625
this is a pretty rational
way of doing it then.

126
00:06:20,708 --> 00:06:23,708
Right, Eraser Head? Rational.

127
00:06:23,791 --> 00:06:25,500
Do whatever you want.

128
00:06:29,041 --> 00:06:31,458
Is he... for real?

129
00:06:31,541 --> 00:06:33,083
[MIRIO]
Oh, yea, totes real.

130
00:06:33,166 --> 00:06:35,500
[AMAJIKI]
Mirio. You're impossible.

131
00:06:35,583 --> 00:06:37,000
Uh.

132
00:06:37,083 --> 00:06:39,000
It would have been simple enough
for us to just tell them.

133
00:06:39,083 --> 00:06:41,625
"This is what it's like,
here's what we learned from it."

134
00:06:41,708 --> 00:06:43,833
Not everyone has
your level of drive.

135
00:06:43,916 --> 00:06:45,583
Plus, think about
how bad it'll look

136
00:06:45,666 --> 00:06:48,041
if some of them can't
recover after fighting you.

137
00:06:48,125 --> 00:06:49,666
No one wants to spend
the next few years

138
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:50,875
in a hospital bed.

139
00:06:50,958 --> 00:06:51,958
[MINETA]
Huh?

140
00:06:52,041 --> 00:06:53,708
I bet he's just trying
to psych us out.

141
00:06:53,791 --> 00:06:55,833
[HADO]
Hey, listen up. It's story time.

142
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:58,125
Long ago, a student
got frustrated in class

143
00:06:58,208 --> 00:07:00,708
and quit being a hero, and it
was terrible for everyone.

144
00:07:00,791 --> 00:07:02,208
Did you know that?

145
00:07:02,291 --> 00:07:04,708
So, Togata, I know
our job is tough.

146
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:06,833
But, you better make sure
you know what you're doing.

147
00:07:06,916 --> 00:07:08,000
Be careful, okay?

148
00:07:08,083 --> 00:07:10,458
[ASHIDO]
Please stop touching those.

149
00:07:10,541 --> 00:07:12,041
[TOKOYAMI]
Let's think about this.

150
00:07:12,125 --> 00:07:14,041
You're obviously much
further ahead than us.

151
00:07:14,125 --> 00:07:15,750
But we've fought pros before.

152
00:07:15,833 --> 00:07:19,291
Not to mention, we took down
some legitimate villains.

153
00:07:19,375 --> 00:07:21,791
I don't think you need
to worry about hurting us.

154
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:24,041
We're not a buncha wannabes.

155
00:07:24,125 --> 00:07:26,208
[MIRIO] Mm! Heard, but you're
gonna have to show me

156
00:07:26,291 --> 00:07:29,416
that's the truth. Now,
who's gonna start this party?

157
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:30,416
I've got this.

158
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,291
No. I'm first.

159
00:07:32,375 --> 00:07:33,708
You stole my thunder!

160
00:07:33,791 --> 00:07:35,166
[gasps]

161
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:36,458
[IZUKU] I'll catch up with
everything I fell behind on

162
00:07:36,541 --> 00:07:38,833
these past three days!

163
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:40,416
[OCHACO]
You can do it.

164
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:43,666
View this as a
learning experience.

165
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:46,458
It's a good opportunity for you.

166
00:07:46,541 --> 00:07:48,000
Oh, the problem child!

167
00:07:48,083 --> 00:07:51,333
Yes, this is perfect, I've heard
you got plenty-a fire in ya.

168
00:07:51,416 --> 00:07:53,416
[IZUKU]
The top student at UA.

169
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:54,666
If I'm gonna spar with someone,

170
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:57,000
he's the best opponent
I could ask for.

171
00:07:58,208 --> 00:08:00,500
[IZUKU] How will I fair
against him at my level?

172
00:08:00,583 --> 00:08:02,666
How much distance is between us?

173
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:05,541
The close combat team should
surround him first thing!

174
00:08:05,625 --> 00:08:06,916
Let's do it.

175
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,375
We've got ourselves
a new mentor.

176
00:08:09,458 --> 00:08:11,875
Thanks for the opportunity, man.

177
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:14,916
The opportunity to
kick your butt.

178
00:08:16,625 --> 00:08:17,583
[gasps]

179
00:08:22,041 --> 00:08:23,125
[screams]

180
00:08:23,208 --> 00:08:24,666
Why did your clothes
just fall off?

181
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:27,666
[MIRIO]
Oopsy! My Quirk's kinda tricky.

182
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:29,583
[IZUKU]
Bad move. You're open!

183
00:08:33,416 --> 00:08:34,500
[IZUKU]
So, that's it!

184
00:08:34,583 --> 00:08:36,416
His Quirk lets things
pass through him.

185
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,916
It's an amazing power.
What should I do?

186
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,416
Went for the face, huh?

187
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:44,500
What's this?

188
00:08:46,166 --> 00:08:47,625
[TENYA]
Where'd he go?

189
00:08:47,708 --> 00:08:50,083
I think I'll start by taking out
the long-distance fighters.

190
00:08:50,166 --> 00:08:51,833
[JIRO screams]

191
00:08:51,916 --> 00:08:53,041
[SHOJI]
He warped?

192
00:08:53,125 --> 00:08:54,541
His power isn't just
slipping through things.

193
00:08:54,625 --> 00:08:56,958
How'd he luck out with
such a good Quirk?

194
00:08:57,041 --> 00:08:58,750
[AMAJIKI]
You're wrong.

195
00:08:58,833 --> 00:09:01,541
Mirio's Quirk isn't what
you should be jealous of.

196
00:09:03,625 --> 00:09:05,541
[AMAJIKI] You should
be envying his skills.

197
00:09:05,625 --> 00:09:08,416
That's what sets him
apart, first-years.

198
00:09:10,291 --> 00:09:11,458
[AOYAMA]

199
00:09:11,541 --> 00:09:12,833
[AMAJIKI] Mirio did a
work study with a hero,

200
00:09:12,916 --> 00:09:16,500
but didn't stop there.
He kept building himself up.

201
00:09:16,583 --> 00:09:18,541
[SHOJI, YAOYOROZU, JIRO groan]

202
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:21,000
[STUDENTS groan]

203
00:09:23,416 --> 00:09:26,166
Power!

204
00:09:29,583 --> 00:09:32,625
Mirio Togata.

205
00:09:32,708 --> 00:09:33,958
In my opinion,

206
00:09:34,041 --> 00:09:36,208
he's the person who's
closest to taking the spot

207
00:09:36,291 --> 00:09:38,916
of number-one hero.

208
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,250
That's including the pros.

209
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:53,958
[STUDENTS groaning]

210
00:09:54,041 --> 00:09:56,833
[TODOROKI] He got more than
half of them in an instant.

211
00:09:56,916 --> 00:09:58,166
A student.

212
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:01,958
But closer to being number
one than most heroes.

213
00:10:02,041 --> 00:10:03,583
You're not gonna fight?

214
00:10:03,666 --> 00:10:06,625
You must be interested in
taking the top spot yourself.

215
00:10:06,708 --> 00:10:09,750
I didn't even get my
provisional license, though.

216
00:10:09,833 --> 00:10:12,291
[AIZAWA] Well, he's
certainly calmed down.

217
00:10:12,375 --> 00:10:15,333
Think that's it for the
long-distance fighters.

218
00:10:15,416 --> 00:10:16,916
All that's left are
the ones who specialize

219
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,291
in close-quarters combat.

220
00:10:18,375 --> 00:10:20,666
I have no idea how
he just did that.

221
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:23,000
It's one thing to be able
to phase through stuff,

222
00:10:23,083 --> 00:10:24,541
but warping, too?

223
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:27,625
He's unrivaled.
Do we stand a chance?

224
00:10:27,708 --> 00:10:30,208
Hold the flattery.

225
00:10:30,291 --> 00:10:32,041
[AMAJIKI]
"Unrivaled"?

226
00:10:32,125 --> 00:10:35,750
Just that one word, and I can
tell what level you're all at.

227
00:10:35,833 --> 00:10:37,416
Like how an ordinary
person might think

228
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:41,750
a pro's impressive, but lack
the ability to figure out why.

229
00:10:41,833 --> 00:10:43,708
If you can't tell how
much hard work Mirio

230
00:10:43,791 --> 00:10:46,708
has put in, then you'll never
be able to match him.

231
00:10:46,791 --> 00:10:49,416
[IZUKU] There's more to his
Quirk than we're seeing.

232
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,833
Whether his true power
is slipping through matter,

233
00:10:51,916 --> 00:10:54,625
or whether he's somehow warping
himself through space...

234
00:10:54,708 --> 00:10:57,708
Either way, he's still
landing his attacks directly.

235
00:10:57,791 --> 00:10:59,166
We should be able
to counter him,

236
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:02,125
in the moment he's
about to make contact.

237
00:11:02,208 --> 00:11:04,000
Even if we can't tell
what he's doing,

238
00:11:04,083 --> 00:11:05,958
we should theorize
with what we do know

239
00:11:06,041 --> 00:11:08,541
and use that knowledge
to find a way to beat him.

240
00:11:08,625 --> 00:11:10,583
Yeah. You said it.

241
00:11:10,666 --> 00:11:13,625
House arrest didn't put a dent
in your fightin' spirit.

242
00:11:13,708 --> 00:11:15,875
Then see if you can
figure out how to win.

243
00:11:22,833 --> 00:11:24,250
[SATO]
He went under!

244
00:11:24,333 --> 00:11:26,500
[IZUKU]
I bet he'll probably come up...

245
00:11:26,583 --> 00:11:28,000
There!

246
00:11:28,083 --> 00:11:29,458
[MIRIO]
He wasn't surprised?

247
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:32,208
[MIRIO] He predicted this
is where I'd be!

248
00:11:32,291 --> 00:11:33,666
Pretty smart.

249
00:11:34,708 --> 00:11:36,875
Watch this. An ultimate move!

250
00:11:36,958 --> 00:11:39,625
Blinder Touch Eyeball Crush!

251
00:11:41,958 --> 00:11:43,166
[IZUKU groans]

252
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:44,875
I've discovered that
most people try to launch

253
00:11:44,958 --> 00:11:47,000
a counterattack
just like you did.

254
00:11:47,083 --> 00:11:49,875
So, naturally, I've trained
to work around such moves.

255
00:11:49,958 --> 00:11:51,500
Nice try, though!

256
00:11:51,583 --> 00:11:52,625
[TENYA]
Midoriya!

257
00:11:54,291 --> 00:11:55,708
[KIRISHIMA]
Damn!

258
00:11:55,791 --> 00:11:56,750
[KIRISHIMA groans]

259
00:11:56,833 --> 00:11:57,708
[gasps]

260
00:12:06,291 --> 00:12:08,750
Power!

261
00:12:08,833 --> 00:12:11,125
[laughs] Hey, check
out Togata, huh--

262
00:12:11,208 --> 00:12:12,833
he's gotten super
powerful lately.

263
00:12:12,916 --> 00:12:14,166
Are you even watching?

264
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:17,250
Mirio's been strong ever
since we were little kids.

265
00:12:17,333 --> 00:12:19,333
Problem is...

266
00:12:19,416 --> 00:12:21,625
He needs to learn
how to hold back.

267
00:12:26,083 --> 00:12:28,333
[MIRIO] I tried to make it so
you wouldn't see my willy.

268
00:12:28,416 --> 00:12:30,416
Sorry if you got a peek.

269
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:31,666
But, anyway.

270
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:33,666
That's a taste of what
it's like to fight me.

271
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:35,416
We all just got
punched in the stomach

272
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:38,166
without ever knowing
what was going on.

273
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:39,416
Right, so, whaddaya think?

274
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:40,458
Isn't my Quirk strong?

275
00:12:40,541 --> 00:12:41,791
Yeah, it's too strong!

276
00:12:41,875 --> 00:12:42,708
[HAGAKURE]
That's not fair!

277
00:12:42,791 --> 00:12:44,375
Mine's nothing in comparison.

278
00:12:44,458 --> 00:12:46,291
How can you slip through
things and warp?

279
00:12:46,375 --> 00:12:48,291
Do you have two powers
like Todoroki does?

280
00:12:48,375 --> 00:12:50,500
Nope. Just the one.

281
00:12:50,583 --> 00:12:51,416
Just one.

282
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:53,041
Ooh. I know!

283
00:12:53,125 --> 00:12:54,666
I'll tell you what his Quirk is.

284
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:57,083
Hey, hey, can I
say it? Permeation!

285
00:12:57,166 --> 00:12:58,458
Cool, right?

286
00:12:58,541 --> 00:13:01,333
[AMAJIKI] Hado. Let Mirio
explain his own power.

287
00:13:01,416 --> 00:13:02,666
Yup!

288
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:04,541
I've got a sweet Quirk
that's called Permeation.

289
00:13:04,625 --> 00:13:06,875
What you guys thought of as
a warp was, you guessed it,

290
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:09,916
simply an alternative
application of that power.

291
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Oh, sorry, Hado.

292
00:13:11,083 --> 00:13:13,250
So, how exactly
do you warp, huh?

293
00:13:13,333 --> 00:13:15,791
I activate my Quirk
in my entire body.

294
00:13:15,875 --> 00:13:18,583
Then, I can pass through
anything I want, no sweat.

295
00:13:18,666 --> 00:13:21,708
Everything! That
includes solid ground.

296
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:23,791
[gasps] So, that was you

297
00:13:23,875 --> 00:13:26,333
falling through the
floor of the gym?

298
00:13:26,416 --> 00:13:28,375
That's right, I went
deep underground.

299
00:13:28,458 --> 00:13:30,875
And then, whenever I release
my Quirk while I'm falling,

300
00:13:30,958 --> 00:13:33,625
something super strange happens.

301
00:13:33,708 --> 00:13:35,875
Apparently, things with
mass can't overlap.

302
00:13:35,958 --> 00:13:39,250
That's called physics!
So, I get repelled upward!

303
00:13:39,333 --> 00:13:40,583
Think of it this way.

304
00:13:40,666 --> 00:13:43,500
The ground spits me out,
and I fly up into the air.

305
00:13:43,583 --> 00:13:45,000
That's how my warp works.

306
00:13:45,083 --> 00:13:47,000
By adjusting the direction
I'm facing or the pose

307
00:13:47,083 --> 00:13:49,333
I'm holding, I can change
the angle I come out at,

308
00:13:49,416 --> 00:13:50,958
so I can aim at different spots.

309
00:13:51,041 --> 00:13:52,833
That sounds like
a buggy video game.

310
00:13:52,916 --> 00:13:54,666
[laughs] Hey,
that's pretty funny!

311
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:56,666
You're able to
avoid any attacks.

312
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:59,041
And you can move where
you want in an instant.

313
00:13:59,125 --> 00:14:01,625
Awe! You were born with
a really strong Quirk.

314
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:03,000
Not true.

315
00:14:03,083 --> 00:14:05,666
My power's only strong
because I made it that way.

316
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:08,583
While my Quirk is activated,
my lungs can't take in oxygen.

317
00:14:08,666 --> 00:14:12,083
Even if I breathe in,
the air'll just pass through.

318
00:14:12,166 --> 00:14:14,500
In the same way,
my eardrums don't work.

319
00:14:14,583 --> 00:14:17,333
And light can't go
through my retinas.

320
00:14:17,416 --> 00:14:19,250
I can pass through everything.

321
00:14:19,333 --> 00:14:22,333
But that means I can't feel
anything when I'm in that state.

322
00:14:22,416 --> 00:14:25,250
Even though I have a body,
I can't stop falling.

323
00:14:25,333 --> 00:14:27,333
I could probably keep
going down forever.

324
00:14:27,416 --> 00:14:28,791
Does that make sense?

325
00:14:28,875 --> 00:14:30,708
That's why, if I wanna go
through something like,

326
00:14:30,791 --> 00:14:34,041
say, a wall. I have
concentrate really hard.

327
00:14:34,125 --> 00:14:36,125
I'll activate everything
except one leg.

328
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:38,541
Then I release the other
leg and land on it.

329
00:14:38,625 --> 00:14:41,625
And then the first leg is
the last one to go through.

330
00:14:41,708 --> 00:14:43,166
Even for a simple
action like that,

331
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:45,875
there are a bunch of
little steps involved.

332
00:14:45,958 --> 00:14:47,375
Oh, man, if I were in a hurry,

333
00:14:47,458 --> 00:14:49,375
I would mess that up
every single time.

334
00:14:49,458 --> 00:14:51,416
Seriously, if you
can't feel anything,

335
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:53,291
how are you supposed to move?

336
00:14:53,375 --> 00:14:54,458
[MIRIO]
Growing up.

337
00:14:54,541 --> 00:14:56,375
I was always behind,
as you might expect.

338
00:14:56,458 --> 00:14:58,666
In no time, I'd
dropped to dead last.

339
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:01,000
I dropped my pants a lot, too.

340
00:15:01,083 --> 00:15:02,625
In order to get to the
top with this Quirk,

341
00:15:02,708 --> 00:15:05,583
I couldn't just hope that
things would get better.

342
00:15:05,666 --> 00:15:06,666
I had to think!

343
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:08,291
I learned to make
combat decisions!

344
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:09,833
And picked up a few new tricks.

345
00:15:09,916 --> 00:15:12,583
But above all, I learned to
predict what would happen next.

346
00:15:12,666 --> 00:15:14,208
And what made those
predictions possible

347
00:15:14,291 --> 00:15:16,208
in the first place
was experience.

348
00:15:16,291 --> 00:15:18,625
I based my predictions
on what I'd learned.

349
00:15:18,708 --> 00:15:20,166
[MIRIO] This was kind
of a roundabout way

350
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:22,500
to get the point across, but
that's why I wanted to fight.

351
00:15:22,583 --> 00:15:25,458
To show you through experience
rather than words.

352
00:15:25,541 --> 00:15:27,458
In our work studies,
we're not treated as guests

353
00:15:27,541 --> 00:15:28,958
like in our internships.

354
00:15:29,041 --> 00:15:32,250
We're regarded as one of the
sidekicks, or even as a pro!

355
00:15:32,333 --> 00:15:34,916
That can be super scary.
Pros can get hurt.

356
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,708
And sometimes they end up
watching people die.

357
00:15:37,791 --> 00:15:40,041
But every scary and painful
thing you go through

358
00:15:40,125 --> 00:15:42,166
is an important experience
that you can't get

359
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:45,500
inside a classroom, even at UA.

360
00:15:45,583 --> 00:15:47,208
I transformed the
experience I got

361
00:15:47,291 --> 00:15:48,791
in my work study into power.

362
00:15:48,875 --> 00:15:50,500
That's how I got
to the top spot!

363
00:15:50,583 --> 00:15:52,541
And... it's why I think
they're worth it,

through all this for us,

00:16:03,333 --> 00:16:05,291
even though he could've
just explained it.

So, these really are different.

370
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:10,041
I did kinda feel like I missed
out on stuff in my internship.

371
00:16:10,125 --> 00:16:13,041
Yeah, they tried not to let us
do anything too dangerous.

Guess it won't be that
way during work studies.

we're on the scene.

Let's be grateful to Mirio.

392
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:58,666
[IZUKU] At first,
his Quirk was something

393
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:00,291
that held him back.

394
00:17:00,375 --> 00:17:03,750
But still. He made
the most of his power.

395
00:17:03,833 --> 00:17:05,833
He got as much
experience as he could

396
00:17:05,916 --> 00:17:09,625
and learned how to
predict people's actions.

397

He's not standing
at the top of UA

398
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:13,291
because he was born strong.

to get to that point.

Hey, so...

00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:26,333
We thought you hurt some of
them on accident, you know?

403
00:17:26,416 --> 00:17:28,708
But no one was, injured,
so I think you did a good job.

404
00:17:28,791 --> 00:17:31,333
Way to go, Mirio. A-plus.

405
00:17:31,416 --> 00:17:33,000
It was pretty close
though, a few times.

406
00:17:33,083 --> 00:17:34,041
And they saw me naked.

407

Yeah, but did
anyone surprise you?

408

I wanna know. C'mon, spill.

409
00:17:38,875 --> 00:17:40,416
Well, I mostly
defeat people using

410
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,125
the element of surprise.

411
00:17:42,208 --> 00:17:45,041
It's my basic strategy
in a nutshell.

412
00:17:45,125 --> 00:17:47,208
But that problem child
analyzed my first round

471
00:19:47,833 --> 00:19:51,125
Way to make something obvious
sound cool, there, sport.

472
00:19:51,208 --> 00:19:53,166
But why don't you go ask
your master about it

473
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:54,875
instead of calling me?

474
00:19:54,958 --> 00:19:57,166
He is supposed to be
devoting himself to teaching

475
00:19:57,250 --> 00:19:58,791
now that he's retired, right?

476
00:19:58,875 --> 00:20:00,083
[IZUKU]
But...

477
00:20:00,166 --> 00:20:01,750
Mr. Aizawa said we should
use the connections

478
00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:03,125
we got from our internships.

479
00:20:03,208 --> 00:20:04,750
[GRAN TORINO] You can, sure,
but that doesn't mean

480
00:20:04,833 --> 00:20:06,333
you have to go that route.

481
00:20:06,416 --> 00:20:07,583
Don't you think that All Might

482
00:20:07,666 --> 00:20:10,625
can introduce you to
a bunch of new people?

483
00:20:10,708 --> 00:20:13,416
First one who comes to mind
is his former sidekick.

484
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:16,333
[gasps]

485
00:20:19,708 --> 00:20:22,708
Sir! I have news!

486
00:20:22,791 --> 00:20:26,125
You're low key
today, aren't you?

487
00:20:26,208 --> 00:20:28,625
Let's hear the report,
and make it quick.

488
00:20:28,708 --> 00:20:30,041
Yes, sir.

489
00:20:30,125 --> 00:20:32,875
One of the persons we're
investigating is on the move.

490
00:20:32,958 --> 00:20:33,750
Overhaul.

491
00:20:33,833 --> 00:20:35,916
The head of the Shie Hassaikai.

492
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:43,208
[CHISAKI coughs] This is your
base? Looks pretty unsanitary

493
00:20:43,291 --> 00:20:46,041
[TWICE] Huh? Like we'd show you
where our main base is.

494
00:20:46,125 --> 00:20:48,208
This one's just a meeting place.

495
00:20:48,291 --> 00:20:49,583
[CHISAKI]
Ridiculous.

496
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:52,041
The air's practically
made of dust here.

497
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:53,458
It's gonna make me sick.

498
00:20:53,541 --> 00:20:54,833
[TWICE]
Join the club.

499
00:20:54,916 --> 00:20:58,458
The guys inside have
been sick for a while.

500
00:20:58,541 --> 00:21:00,708
[SIR NIGHTEYE] And what
do you think he's doing?

501
00:21:00,791 --> 00:21:02,666
It appears he's made contact.

502
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:04,750
With the League of Villains.

503
00:21:06,666 --> 00:21:08,291
[TWICE]
Hey, guys! I'm back!

504
00:21:08,375 --> 00:21:09,875
And I brought that dude!

505
00:21:09,958 --> 00:21:13,083
He said he wanted to talk
to you, so, here we are.

506
00:21:13,166 --> 00:21:14,791
He's quiet, but pretty cool.

507
00:21:14,875 --> 00:21:16,916
He seems like a real creep.

508
00:21:20,875 --> 00:21:22,625
[CHISAKI coughs]

509
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:25,750
[SHIGARAKI]
Well, now.

510
00:21:25,833 --> 00:21:29,458
You brought us a pretty
big catch, huh, Twice?

511
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:35,083
[IZUKU] Just like we
were one step closer

512
00:21:35,166 --> 00:21:37,250
to becoming real heroes.

513
00:21:37,333 --> 00:21:38,625
So, too, were the villains

514
00:21:38,708 --> 00:21:41,250
moving even deeper
into the darkness.

515
00:21:42,583 --> 00:21:44,916
[IZUKU]
The entrusted successor.

516
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,833
And the successor
released into the wild.

517
00:21:49,916 --> 00:21:52,416
[IZUKU]
Soon, they would meet.

518
00:23:29,208 --> 00:23:31,625
[IZUKU] My classmates
and I are going beyond!

519
00:23:38,041 --> 00:23:40,375
[IZUKU] <i>My Hero Academia</i>
isn't done yet!

520
00:23:40,458 --> 00:23:43,416
See you in season
four. Plus Ultra!
