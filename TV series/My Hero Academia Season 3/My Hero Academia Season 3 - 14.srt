00:00:10,416 --> 00:00:13,000
[IZUKU] Welcome to UA High,
the prestigious school

2
00:00:13,083 --> 00:00:16,125
that's turned out some of
the world's greatest heroes.

3
00:00:16,208 --> 00:00:18,291
I'm running toward my
dream in these halls.

4
00:00:18,375 --> 00:00:19,666
Learning to overcome obstacles

5
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:22,916
and save people with
a smile on my face.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,916
That's how I'll become the
greatest hero in the world!

7
00:02:01,291 --> 00:02:04,041
[ALL MIGHT]
Young Midoriya. Listen.

8
00:02:04,125 --> 00:02:06,541
I'm officially retired as a pro.

9
00:02:06,625 --> 00:02:08,083
It's clear now that my body

10
00:02:08,166 --> 00:02:10,541
won't allow me to
fight another battle.

11
00:02:12,041 --> 00:02:15,500
[ALL MIGHT] The last sparks
of One For All have left me.

12
00:02:15,583 --> 00:02:16,875
And my muscle form won't last

13
00:02:16,958 --> 00:02:19,291
for any significant
amount of time.

14
00:02:19,375 --> 00:02:20,375
I can't protect you

15
00:02:20,458 --> 00:02:21,958
when you put yourself
in danger now.

16
00:02:22,041 --> 00:02:23,625
And you're always rushing
in to try and help,

17
00:02:23,708 --> 00:02:24,791
no matter what I tell you.

18
00:02:24,875 --> 00:02:27,541
Destroying your body,
over and over.

19
00:02:27,625 --> 00:02:29,833
Yet, back there,
you managed to...

20
00:02:32,375 --> 00:02:34,791
[ALL MIGHT] ...rescue your
friend without being injured

21
00:02:34,875 --> 00:02:37,791
or getting into a fight.
I'm so proud of you.

22
00:02:37,875 --> 00:02:40,000
[gasps]

23
00:02:40,083 --> 00:02:41,333
[ALL MIGHT]
From here on out,

24
00:02:41,416 --> 00:02:44,208
I will devote myself
to training you.

25
00:02:44,291 --> 00:02:45,666
You're stuck with me.

26
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:48,250
So let's keep working
hard together.

27
00:02:48,333 --> 00:02:49,791
Thank you.

28
00:02:49,875 --> 00:02:53,583
Nothing would make me
happier, All Might.

29
00:02:53,666 --> 00:02:55,416
I'll do my best!

30
00:02:56,958 --> 00:02:59,791
Wait. This isn't...

31
00:02:59,875 --> 00:03:02,666
Oh, right. I'm in the dorm now.

32
00:03:05,916 --> 00:03:07,291
[IZUKU]
Good morning.

33
00:03:09,666 --> 00:03:11,541
[IZUKU] After being attacked
by the League of Villains

34
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:13,416
twice in one school year,

35
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,458
UA brought its students
to live on campus

36
00:03:15,541 --> 00:03:17,500
in order to keep us safe.

37
00:03:18,458 --> 00:03:20,916
[IZUKU] Our dorm, Heights
Alliance, was a five-minute walk

38
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,708
from the main school building.

39
00:03:22,791 --> 00:03:25,375
Things were a little strange
at first, but once we finally

40
00:03:25,458 --> 00:03:27,166
settled into our
new home, we returned

41
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:30,458
to normal coursework and our
goal of becoming heroes.

42
00:03:33,041 --> 00:03:35,250
[IZUKU] I will definitely
be a pro one day.

43
00:03:35,333 --> 00:03:38,833
Because of what I
inherited from All Might.

44
00:03:38,916 --> 00:03:42,458
Not just One For All,
but his spirit, too!

45
00:03:47,708 --> 00:03:49,666
[AIZAWA] I believe I
mentioned this already,

46
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:51,666
but your main focus this summer

47
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:54,416
is obtaining provisional
hero licenses.

48
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,041
[STUDENTS]
Yes, sir!

49
00:03:56,125 --> 00:03:57,791
Do not take this lightly.

50
00:03:57,875 --> 00:04:01,708
A hero license means that you're
responsible for human lives.

51
00:04:01,791 --> 00:04:05,458
You can imagine that the exam to
receive one is very difficult.

52
00:04:05,541 --> 00:04:07,833
Only 50 percent of
students pass the tests

53
00:04:07,916 --> 00:04:09,916
required for these
permits each year.

54
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,916
It's that hard to get
a provisional license?

55
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,250
[AIZAWA] In order to prepare,
today you'll concentrate

56
00:04:15,333 --> 00:04:17,375
on creating something new.

57
00:04:19,708 --> 00:04:21,541
[AIZAWA]
Two ultimate moves.

58
00:04:21,625 --> 00:04:23,125
[KAMINARI, KIRISHIMA]
Ultimate moves?

59
00:04:23,208 --> 00:04:25,125
[BOTH] An exam is a
normal school thing.

60
00:04:25,208 --> 00:04:27,500
[KIRISHIMA, SERO]
But this is total hero work!

61
00:04:29,166 --> 00:04:31,250
[ECTOPLASM] When we say
"ultimate," we mean a move

62
00:04:31,333 --> 00:04:33,833
that will ensure you win
against your opponent.

63
00:04:33,916 --> 00:04:36,125
[CEMENTOSS] An action
so unique to your identity

64
00:04:36,208 --> 00:04:39,041
that no other person
can hope to copy it.

65
00:04:39,125 --> 00:04:40,291
Simply put,

66
00:04:40,375 --> 00:04:43,000
you must learn to lean
into your strengths.

67
00:04:43,083 --> 00:04:45,291
[MIDNIGHT] Your moves
represent who you are.

68
00:04:45,375 --> 00:04:48,125
These days, most pro heroes
have an ultimate move.

69
00:04:48,208 --> 00:04:50,250
Those who don't are fools.

70
00:04:50,333 --> 00:04:51,625
This may sound abstract,

71
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:54,375
but we'll explain more
as the day goes on.

72
00:04:54,458 --> 00:04:56,166
For now, change
into your costumes

73
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:58,208
and meet in Gym Gamma.

74
00:05:01,708 --> 00:05:04,541
[AIZAWA] Gym Gamma,
also known at the Academy

75
00:05:04,625 --> 00:05:08,625
as the "Training
Dining Land," or TDL.

76
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:09,666
[OCHACO, ASHIDO, IZUKU]
Huh?

77
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:12,375
[IZUKU]
First the USJ, and now this?

78
00:05:13,541 --> 00:05:15,708
This facility was my idea.

79
00:05:15,791 --> 00:05:17,958
We can prepare unique
terrains and obstacles

80
00:05:18,041 --> 00:05:19,291
for each student here.

81
00:05:19,375 --> 00:05:21,625
Here you will learn
to serve up justice,

82
00:05:21,708 --> 00:05:22,458
hence the name.

83
00:05:22,541 --> 00:05:24,041
That's pretty cool.

84
00:05:24,125 --> 00:05:25,958
[TENYA]
Please allow me a question.

85
00:05:26,041 --> 00:05:27,791
What is the advantage
of having ultimate moves

86
00:05:27,875 --> 00:05:29,208
for our provisional exam?

87
00:05:29,291 --> 00:05:30,833
May we know your reasoning?

88
00:05:30,916 --> 00:05:34,333
That's two questions. Calm down.

89
00:05:34,416 --> 00:05:36,250
The job of a hero
is to save people

90
00:05:36,333 --> 00:05:37,916
from all sorts of dangers.

91
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,875
Crime, accidents, and natural
or man-made disasters.

92
00:05:41,958 --> 00:05:43,833
Of course, the
licensing exam analyzes

93
00:05:43,916 --> 00:05:46,625
how well you're able
to deal with such things.

94
00:05:46,708 --> 00:05:48,166
It won't just be fighting.

95
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:49,791
Your ability to
gather information

96
00:05:49,875 --> 00:05:51,833
and make quick decisions
will be judged.

97
00:05:51,916 --> 00:05:54,291
In addition to how well
you communicate, cooperate,

98
00:05:54,375 --> 00:05:55,833
and lead others.

99
00:05:55,916 --> 00:05:59,708
Every year a new test is used
to evaluate these qualities.

100
00:05:59,791 --> 00:06:01,708
One thing is
especially important.

101
00:06:01,791 --> 00:06:03,166
If you want to be a pro hero,

102
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:05,833
you must be able to
prevail in battle.

103
00:06:05,916 --> 00:06:07,875
If you're prepared,
you won't have to worry.

104
00:06:07,958 --> 00:06:09,375
And those of you with
an ultimate move

105
00:06:09,458 --> 00:06:11,291
will have stronger results.

106
00:06:11,375 --> 00:06:13,125
Your circumstances
should not dictate

107
00:06:13,208 --> 00:06:15,375
the results of your
future battles.

108
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:17,833
Learn to be consistent and
you will be a great asset

109
00:06:17,916 --> 00:06:19,500
on the front lines.

110
00:06:19,583 --> 00:06:21,583
[ECTOPLASM] Your ultimate
move doesn't necessarily

111
00:06:21,666 --> 00:06:23,125
have to be an attack.

112
00:06:23,208 --> 00:06:25,416
Take Iida's Reciproburst,
for example.

113
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:26,666
[TENYA gasps]

114
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:28,333
[ECTOPLASM] This sort of
temporary boost in speed

115
00:06:28,416 --> 00:06:30,666
is valuable enough that
it falls into the category

116
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:32,666
of excellence we're looking for.

117
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:34,541
[TENYA gasps]
You mean I've been doing

118
00:06:34,625 --> 00:06:35,791
an ultimate move all along?

119
00:06:35,875 --> 00:06:37,875
So, it's basically
our secret weapon.

120
00:06:37,958 --> 00:06:39,916
Something that gives us
the edge so we can win

121
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,958
no matter who or
what we're facing.

122
00:06:42,041 --> 00:06:43,500
There's a smart boy.

123
00:06:43,583 --> 00:06:45,625
For example, how
Kamui Woods is able

124
00:06:45,708 --> 00:06:47,250
to use his Lacquered
Chain Prison

125
00:06:47,333 --> 00:06:49,333
to capture opponents
in an instant.

126
00:06:49,416 --> 00:06:51,833
That's exactly what
we want to see.

127
00:06:51,916 --> 00:06:54,041
The training camp
was interrupted.

128
00:06:54,125 --> 00:06:56,333
But the practice you did get
in to develop your Quirks

129
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:58,083
was part of the process
needed to create

130
00:06:58,166 --> 00:07:00,250
these defining abilities.

131
00:07:00,333 --> 00:07:01,958
Now that you're caught up--

132
00:07:02,041 --> 00:07:04,083
you'll be working hard
to develop powerful moves

133
00:07:04,166 --> 00:07:06,541
of your own for the
next ten days or so.

134
00:07:06,625 --> 00:07:08,000
This is how you will
spend the remainder

135
00:07:08,083 --> 00:07:10,708
of your summer vacation.

136
00:07:10,791 --> 00:07:13,333
Prepare for intensive training.

137
00:07:13,416 --> 00:07:14,583
In addition, you
should think about

138
00:07:14,666 --> 00:07:17,666
how you can improve your
costumes, especially now

139
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:21,250
that you have a better
understanding of your Quirks.

140
00:07:21,333 --> 00:07:24,291
I expect each of you
to go Plus Ultra.

141
00:07:24,375 --> 00:07:26,041
Do you have it in you?

142
00:07:26,125 --> 00:07:26,916
[STUDENTS]
Yes, sir!

143
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,375
I am so charged up for this.

144
00:07:31,666 --> 00:07:33,166
[IZUKU]
What's my move?

145
00:07:42,791 --> 00:07:44,041
[ECTOPLASM]
It's obvious you're relying

146
00:07:44,125 --> 00:07:45,750
too much on your tail.

147
00:07:45,833 --> 00:07:48,541
Let's re-examine the
basics of how you fight.

148
00:07:48,625 --> 00:07:49,958
Yes, sir!

149
00:07:50,041 --> 00:07:53,458
[OJIRO]
But my tail is my power.

150
00:07:53,541 --> 00:07:54,625
Ultimate move.

151
00:07:54,708 --> 00:07:58,708
Shooting acid from
my hands. Super geyser!

152
00:07:58,791 --> 00:08:00,041
Whaddaya think?

153
00:08:00,125 --> 00:08:01,541
[ECTOPLASM] If you're
going to go that route,

154
00:08:01,625 --> 00:08:04,583
make a nozzle with your fingers
to increase aim and reach.

155
00:08:04,666 --> 00:08:07,583
Yes, like that. Go.

156
00:08:07,666 --> 00:08:10,041
Oh, crap! I'm totally awesome!

157
00:08:10,125 --> 00:08:11,666
[ECTOPLASM]
Now let's focus on increasing

158
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:14,083
the potency of your acid.

159
00:08:14,166 --> 00:08:16,375
Two Creations at the same time.

160
00:08:16,458 --> 00:08:18,166
You may start with
something simple.

161
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:19,333
Yes, sir!

162
00:08:24,791 --> 00:08:26,500
[IZUKU]
Everyone's making headway.

163
00:08:26,583 --> 00:08:27,750
[IZUKU grunts]

164
00:08:27,833 --> 00:08:29,375
[ECTOPLASM] Why are you
staring off into space?

165
00:08:29,458 --> 00:08:30,625
[IZUKU]
Oh, um.

166
00:08:30,708 --> 00:08:33,583
About the moves we're
coming up with. See...

167
00:08:33,666 --> 00:08:35,291
If I put too much
power into my arms,

168
00:08:35,375 --> 00:08:38,125
then I won't be able
to use them anymore.

169
00:08:38,208 --> 00:08:39,333
I'll break them.

170
00:08:39,416 --> 00:08:40,875
So I don't know what
a special attack of mine

171
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:42,750
would even look like.

172
00:08:42,833 --> 00:08:45,625
[ECTOPLASM] Hm. It's true that
your Quirk is interesting.

173
00:08:45,708 --> 00:08:48,875
Not exactly one that
we'd call consistent.

174
00:08:48,958 --> 00:08:51,208
If you don't have a
fixed attack style yet,

175
00:08:51,291 --> 00:08:54,208
then let's focus on
developing your power.

176
00:08:54,291 --> 00:08:55,625
Yes, sir.

177
00:08:59,041 --> 00:09:01,541
[ALL MIGHT]
Everyone's workin' hard, huh?

178
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:02,958
[AIZAWA]
All Might.

179
00:09:03,041 --> 00:09:05,625
Yeah, I am here.

180
00:09:05,708 --> 00:09:07,500
Because I have the day
off and I don't have

181
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:10,125
anything else to do. Ha!

182
00:09:10,208 --> 00:09:12,625
[AIZAWA] Will you please
focus on recuperating

183
00:09:12,708 --> 00:09:14,250
and lesson planning?

184
00:09:14,333 --> 00:09:16,000
Hey, why the cold reception?

185
00:09:16,083 --> 00:09:18,291
They're workin' their
big moves now, right?

186
00:09:18,375 --> 00:09:21,000
There's no way I could
miss being here for this.

187
00:09:21,083 --> 00:09:23,500
I'm still a UA
teacher, you know.

188
00:09:25,416 --> 00:09:26,791
[ALL MIGHT]
Young Midoriya.

189
00:09:26,875 --> 00:09:28,250
Looks like you're
having trouble.

190
00:09:28,333 --> 00:09:29,750
[crash]

191
00:09:31,208 --> 00:09:33,166
Now you explode!

192
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:39,333
It's been a while since I was
able to really let loose.

193
00:09:39,416 --> 00:09:41,500
Ectoplasm! I killed 'em!

194
00:09:41,583 --> 00:09:43,541
Gimme another one.

195
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:45,291
That boy is incredible.

196
00:09:45,375 --> 00:09:49,291
Yes. And he'll get even
stronger in the future.

197
00:09:51,875 --> 00:09:53,583
Ooh. Look at that!

198
00:09:53,666 --> 00:09:55,500
Bakugo's going hardcore.

199
00:09:55,583 --> 00:09:58,916
I bet he's got a ton of ideas
for his special moves already.

200
00:09:59,000 --> 00:09:59,916
[HAGAKURE]
He's been planning this stuff

201
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,625
since the entrance exam!

202
00:10:01,708 --> 00:10:03,125
[yelps] Whoops!

203
00:10:03,208 --> 00:10:04,208
[ECTOPLASM]
Focus!

204
00:10:04,291 --> 00:10:05,458
[OCHACO]
Yes, sir!

205
00:10:05,541 --> 00:10:06,916
[MINETA] Just in case
anyone was wondering,

206
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,750
I've been working on
Grape Rush since I was a kid.

207
00:10:09,833 --> 00:10:12,416
I mean, we've all thought
about it before, right?

208
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:14,666
I used to imagine wielding
a lightning sword!

209
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:16,541
I'm getting hyped up
just thinking about

210
00:10:16,625 --> 00:10:19,333
doing something that
cool in real life.

211
00:10:20,458 --> 00:10:24,041
[IZUKU] How can I fight
with these damaged arms?

212
00:10:24,125 --> 00:10:26,250
[ALL MIGHT]
Hey.

213
00:10:26,333 --> 00:10:27,666
What are you doing here?

214
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:30,125
[ALL MIGHT]
I've come with advice.

215
00:10:30,208 --> 00:10:31,416
Think for yourself.

216
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:33,958
You're still trying
to imitate me.

217
00:10:34,041 --> 00:10:36,625
Oh. I guess I didn't...

218
00:10:36,708 --> 00:10:38,375
Yo, Young Kirishima.

219
00:10:38,458 --> 00:10:39,791
Hey, All Might.

220
00:10:39,875 --> 00:10:42,041
[ALL MIGHT] I've got some
wisdom to lay down on ya.

221
00:10:43,416 --> 00:10:45,458
[ALL MIGHT] So, instead of
going for small tricks

222
00:10:45,541 --> 00:10:48,166
with your Hardening,
try being a bulldozer.

223
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:49,875
Yes, sir!

224
00:10:49,958 --> 00:10:51,125
[ALL MIGHT]
I wouldn't be a good teacher

225
00:10:51,208 --> 00:10:53,333
if I just gave you the answers.

226
00:10:53,416 --> 00:10:55,833
Use that clever head
on your shoulders.

227
00:10:55,916 --> 00:10:58,000
There's no right or wrong here.

228
00:10:58,083 --> 00:10:59,958
What's important
is that you realize

229
00:11:00,041 --> 00:11:02,541
your full potential on your own.

230
00:11:02,625 --> 00:11:04,375
[ALL MIGHT]
Young Jiro. Listen up.

231
00:11:04,458 --> 00:11:05,875
I have a few things
that might help you.

232
00:11:05,958 --> 00:11:07,708
[AIZAWA]
He's suddenly good at this?

233
00:11:07,791 --> 00:11:09,000
[gasps]

234
00:11:16,916 --> 00:11:19,000
[AIZAWA] Regarding your
costume improvements.

235
00:11:19,083 --> 00:11:22,083
Once you've figured out if
anything needs to change,

236
00:11:22,166 --> 00:11:24,125
head to the
development studio here.

237
00:11:24,208 --> 00:11:26,958
Get the experts to help you
out and give suggestions.

238
00:11:27,041 --> 00:11:28,750
They'll know what to do.

239
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,375
Think for yourself.

240
00:11:33,458 --> 00:11:35,708
You're still trying
to imitate me.

241
00:11:36,791 --> 00:11:38,833
[IZUKU] I don't really get
why that's a bad thing.

242
00:11:38,916 --> 00:11:41,250
But I know I have to do
something about this.

243
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:42,708
They have to have
some kind of brace

244
00:11:42,791 --> 00:11:45,041
to reinforce my arms here.

245
00:11:45,125 --> 00:11:47,750
I've gotta train my body
so I can wield One For All

246
00:11:47,833 --> 00:11:49,708
at maximum power.

247
00:11:50,916 --> 00:11:52,791
[IZUKU] And I need to figure
out a way to use my Quirk

248
00:11:52,875 --> 00:11:54,625
in my ultimate move.

249
00:11:54,708 --> 00:11:58,458
Otherwise, I'll fall
behind everyone else.

250
00:11:58,541 --> 00:12:00,083
That's not going to happen.

251
00:12:00,166 --> 00:12:03,625
I have to make it to the
top and achieve my dream.

252
00:12:04,666 --> 00:12:05,875
[TENYA]
Ah, I see.

253
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:08,416
You're focusing on making
your own body float.

254
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,500
[OCHACO] Mm-hm. If I
increase my mobility,

255
00:12:10,583 --> 00:12:11,666
I can use the martial arts

256
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:13,541
I learned from my
internship even more.

257
00:12:13,625 --> 00:12:14,916
What are you doing?

258
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,041
It's quite simple.

259
00:12:16,125 --> 00:12:18,458
I want to reduce
Recipro's drawbacks.

260
00:12:18,541 --> 00:12:22,125
I plan on asking the development
studio to improve my radiator.

261
00:12:23,458 --> 00:12:25,166
[OCHACO]
Oh! Hey there, Deku!

262
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:26,708
I was just wondering
where you were!

263
00:12:26,791 --> 00:12:28,250
Don't run in the halls!

264
00:12:28,333 --> 00:12:30,625
You here for costume
improvements, too?

265
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:31,958
Oh, Uraraka.

266
00:12:35,208 --> 00:12:37,250
[BOTH gasp]

267
00:12:39,208 --> 00:12:41,583
[HATSUME] Ow, ow, ow, ow,
owie, owie, ow.

268
00:12:41,666 --> 00:12:43,875
[POWER LOADER coughs] Ya know,
you shouldn't try to mix

269
00:12:43,958 --> 00:12:46,666
everything you can find in
the lab together like that.

270
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:49,583
[HATSUME chuckles] Failure is
the mother of invention,

271
00:12:49,666 --> 00:12:52,041
Mr. Power Loader.
Thomas Edison said

272
00:12:52,125 --> 00:12:53,833
something like that once.

273
00:12:53,916 --> 00:12:55,666
[HATSUME coughs]

274
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:57,250
[HATSUME] Even if something
I make doesn't work

275
00:12:57,333 --> 00:12:58,458
like I've envisioned it,

276
00:12:58,541 --> 00:13:00,666
that doesn't mean
it's a waste of time.

277
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:03,625
You almost blew up
the entire design studio!

278
00:13:03,708 --> 00:13:05,000
Will you please open your ears

279
00:13:05,083 --> 00:13:07,791
and listen to me
for once? Hatsume!

280
00:13:07,875 --> 00:13:10,083
Hey. When did you get here?

281
00:13:15,791 --> 00:13:17,416
[OCHACO]
Boobs!

282
00:13:27,041 --> 00:13:29,500
[HATSUME] Oh, sorry about
the sudden explosion.

283
00:13:29,583 --> 00:13:30,791
It's been a while, huh?

284
00:13:30,875 --> 00:13:33,583
Class 1A, right? Uh...

285
00:13:33,666 --> 00:13:35,916
Yeah, I forgot all
your names already.

286
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,333
Uh, Izuku Midoriya. H--

287
00:13:38,416 --> 00:13:39,750
I'm Tenya Iida!

288
00:13:39,833 --> 00:13:42,000
The man you tricked into
being a walking advertisement

289
00:13:42,083 --> 00:13:43,041
during the sports festival.

290
00:13:43,125 --> 00:13:44,333
Never heard a' you.

291
00:13:44,416 --> 00:13:47,166
Well, I'm busy developing
new babies, so, bye!

292
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:48,708
Wait a second, please!

293
00:13:48,791 --> 00:13:50,583
I wanted to ask
Mr. Power Loader about

294
00:13:50,666 --> 00:13:53,250
improving some elements
of my costume.

295
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:55,375
Wha... Wha... What?

296
00:13:55,458 --> 00:13:56,583
You can count me in!

297
00:13:56,666 --> 00:13:58,083
[POWER LOADER]
Hatsume!

298
00:13:58,166 --> 00:14:00,333
It's fine for you to be in
and out of the studio all day

299
00:14:00,416 --> 00:14:01,833
since you're in the dorms.

300
00:14:01,916 --> 00:14:03,666
But if you stop
following my instructions

301
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:05,708
and keep running wild in here...

302
00:14:05,791 --> 00:14:06,958
...you're banned.

303
00:14:07,041 --> 00:14:08,125
Um. Hello.

304
00:14:08,208 --> 00:14:09,416
[POWER LOADER]
I heard from Eraser Head.

305
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:11,291
You're here to upgrade
those costumes

306
00:14:11,375 --> 00:14:14,250
for your new moves,
yes? Come in.

307
00:14:16,833 --> 00:14:20,458
[IZUKU] Ooh! This looks
like a top-secret lab!

308
00:14:20,541 --> 00:14:23,041
Now. Hand over your
instructions, please.

309
00:14:23,125 --> 00:14:24,208
They should've been
with the case

310
00:14:24,291 --> 00:14:25,750
your costume was delivered in.

311
00:14:25,833 --> 00:14:27,541
I have a license
to make costumes,

312
00:14:27,625 --> 00:14:29,375
so I'm allowed to do
some mild tinkering

313
00:14:29,458 --> 00:14:31,625
with those that were
made out-of-house.

314
00:14:31,708 --> 00:14:33,208
For small changes and repairs,

315
00:14:33,291 --> 00:14:36,291
I can simply report what I
altered to the design company.

316
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:38,166
They'll do the paperwork for me.

317
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:39,583
But, for major changes,

318
00:14:39,666 --> 00:14:41,791
we'll have to fill out
an application and ask

319
00:14:41,875 --> 00:14:44,708
the design professionals to
make the adjustments for us.

320
00:14:44,791 --> 00:14:46,583
After that's completed,
the government

321
00:14:46,666 --> 00:14:49,208
will make sure the new costume
meets certain standards.

322
00:14:49,291 --> 00:14:51,541
When approved,
it'll be sent back here.

323
00:14:51,625 --> 00:14:55,083
And we work with the best
design agencies available.

324
00:14:55,166 --> 00:14:57,750
So there's usually just
a three-day turnaround.

325
00:14:57,833 --> 00:14:59,000
Uh, well.

326
00:14:59,083 --> 00:15:00,791
I was wondering if there
was a way I could reduce

327
00:15:00,875 --> 00:15:03,000
the strain on the
ligaments in my arms.

328
00:15:03,083 --> 00:15:05,000
Is that hard? Or possible?

329
00:15:05,083 --> 00:15:07,291
[POWER LOADER]
Hmm, let's see, Midoriya.

330
00:15:07,375 --> 00:15:10,041
You mainly fight with your
fists and your fingers.

331
00:15:10,125 --> 00:15:11,458
In that case,

332
00:15:11,541 --> 00:15:14,708
I should be able to do
something for you pretty fast.

333
00:15:14,791 --> 00:15:16,208
Deku, that's awesome!

334
00:15:16,291 --> 00:15:17,541
Yeah!

335
00:15:21,125 --> 00:15:22,791
Yes, yes, I see the problem.

336
00:15:22,875 --> 00:15:26,291
H-Hatsume. What are
you doing to him?

337
00:15:26,375 --> 00:15:28,375
[HATSUME]
I'm feeling out his muscles.

338
00:15:28,458 --> 00:15:31,041
Oh, my, your body's much more
muscle-y than it looks.

339
00:15:31,125 --> 00:15:32,625
[shrieks]

340
00:15:32,708 --> 00:15:33,875
[HATSUME]
Don't you worry.

341
00:15:33,958 --> 00:15:35,875
I've got just what you need.

342
00:15:35,958 --> 00:15:39,541
My very special baby.
The power suit!

343
00:15:39,625 --> 00:15:40,416
Okay.

344
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:41,666
This high-tech darling can read

345
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:44,083
muscle contractions and
support your movements.

346
00:15:44,166 --> 00:15:47,083
Meet my baby number 49!

347
00:15:47,166 --> 00:15:49,416
Um. But I really just need
support for my arms.

348
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:51,208
[HATSUME]
Program Start!

Holy whoa. This

00:15:54,041 --> 00:15:55,750
Wait. No. I take it back.

00:15:55,833 --> 00:15:57,916
My spine! It's
twisting me in half!

--Oh, god, I'm gonna die.
--[OCHACO] Are you okay?

00:15:59,791 --> 00:16:00,708
End program.

354
00:16:00,791 --> 00:16:02,166
Looks like I made
a mistake or two

355
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:04,125
in the limit calculations.

356
00:16:04,208 --> 00:16:05,458
That's my bad.

Oh, my gosh, are you hurt?

358
00:16:07,041 --> 00:16:09,166
[IZUKU] I came in asking
for some kind of arm brace,

359
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:10,958
and instead my body
almost got pretzeled.

360
00:16:11,041 --> 00:16:12,125
Now that I think about it,

361
00:16:12,208 --> 00:16:14,666
I could use this suit
as a capture item.

362
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:17,083
Sir. I was wondering
if you could improve

363
00:16:17,166 --> 00:16:19,041
the cooling devices in my legs.

364
00:16:19,125 --> 00:16:21,291
If that's what you're
in the market for.

365
00:16:21,375 --> 00:16:22,875
Try this baby on!

00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:23,958
How--?

367
00:16:24,041 --> 00:16:25,416
It's an electric
booster for radiators

368
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,666
that can coolify anything
that gives off heat!

369
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:29,458
Sweet baby number 36.

370
00:16:29,541 --> 00:16:31,750
Hatsume, there's nothing
wrong with my boosters.

Come on, it's so brilliant.

If you're wanting to
cool down your legs,

look past her own devices.

I'm not sure
that'll ever happen.

But y'know.

If you all are
aspiring to be heroes,

then you should treasure
your relationship with her.

even when school's
not in session.

is something special.

in such a short time?

00:21:29,708 --> 00:21:32,166
usually involve his fists.

476
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:34,291
Since I inherited
One For All from him,

477
00:21:34,375 --> 00:21:36,125
I tried to do the same thing.

478
00:21:36,208 --> 00:21:38,833
Copying his every technique.

479
00:21:38,916 --> 00:21:40,875
That's where I went wrong.

480
00:21:40,958 --> 00:21:43,583
It's so obvious that
I didn't even realize it!

481
00:21:45,375 --> 00:21:49,125
[IZUKU] If I'm worried about
my arms, then I'll use my legs.

482
00:21:49,208 --> 00:21:52,916
One For All: Full
Cowling. Shoot Style!

483
00:21:56,208 --> 00:21:57,916
You did it, kid.

484
00:23:29,375 --> 00:23:30,541
[IZUKU]
Here's the preview!

485
00:23:30,625 --> 00:23:32,041
Using my legs instead of my arms

486
00:23:32,125 --> 00:23:34,125
is the key to my new
way of fighting.

487
00:23:34,208 --> 00:23:37,125
One For All, Full Cowling:
Shoot Style!

488
00:23:37,208 --> 00:23:39,750
Together with Costume Gamma
that Hatsume made for me,

489
00:23:39,833 --> 00:23:43,208
I'm finally ready for the
Provisional Hero Licensing Exam!

490
00:23:43,291 --> 00:23:44,833
If I can just pass this test,

491
00:23:44,916 --> 00:23:46,791
then I can participate
in hero work,

492
00:23:46,875 --> 00:23:49,666
taking me one step closer to
my dream of becoming a pro.

493
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:51,458
Next time, "The Test."

494
00:23:51,541 --> 00:23:54,291
Shiketsu High School,
Ketsubutsu Academy;

495
00:23:54,375 --> 00:23:56,041
we've got some fearsome rivals.

496
00:23:56,125 --> 00:23:58,166
Go beyond! Plus Ultra!
