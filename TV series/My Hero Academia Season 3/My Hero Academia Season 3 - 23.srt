1
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:12,416
I've been giving it
a lot of thought.

2
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:14,750
You got your Quirk from
All Might, didn't you?

3
00:00:14,833 --> 00:00:16,666
He gave you his power.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,958
You're not trying
to deny anything.

5
00:00:21,041 --> 00:00:25,333
Which means I must
be right. So say it.

6
00:00:25,416 --> 00:00:28,166
Okay. What if it's true?

7
00:00:29,916 --> 00:00:31,375
When you and I were kids,

8
00:00:31,458 --> 00:00:33,833
we both wanted to be
like All Might.

9
00:00:33,916 --> 00:00:36,833
But I had the potential.

10
00:00:36,916 --> 00:00:38,750
Then somehow, a little
nobody like you

11
00:00:38,833 --> 00:00:41,541
was singled out by the
person I admired most,

12
00:00:41,625 --> 00:00:44,000
and I didn't even realize it.

13
00:00:44,083 --> 00:00:46,708
That's why we're here.

14
00:00:46,791 --> 00:00:48,416
We are settling this.

15
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:51,000
Right here. Right now.

16
00:00:51,083 --> 00:00:52,333
Wait, what?

17
00:00:52,416 --> 00:00:54,416
How is that the best way
for us to work things out?

18
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:55,958
No. This is bad.

19
00:00:56,041 --> 00:00:58,666
We're not even supposed to be
at Ground Beta by ourselves.

20
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:01,375
Why don't we talk about this
during one of our free periods?

21
00:01:01,458 --> 00:01:03,541
We could reserve a training
room or something.

22
00:01:03,625 --> 00:01:06,166
There's no reason
it has to be right now.

23
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:08,458
If we fight for real at
school, we'll be stopped.

give his power
to a loser like you.

27
00:01:14,458 --> 00:01:16,791
Let me see for myself.

28
00:01:16,875 --> 00:01:20,166
Is it because you looked up
to him more than I did?

29
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:21,791
And if that's the case,

30
00:01:21,875 --> 00:01:25,875
does it mean everything I've
done to be like him is wrong?

31
00:01:25,958 --> 00:01:27,125
No, Kacchan.

[KATSUKI] Hey! Did you
see what he just did?

33
00:01:29,708 --> 00:01:33,416
Man, it doesn't get any
cooler than All Might!

34
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:35,250

He's always smiling.

No matter how bad things get.

[KATSUKI] No matter how
much trouble he's in,

he's always the winner.

38

[IZUKU] He's the coolest
in the universe!

39

[IZUKU] Do you think
I can be a hero, too?

00:03:22,541 --> 00:03:25,208
[IZUKU]
Y-You really wanna do this?

If you don't wanna
get hurt, punch back.

more these days, didn't you?

A right hook?

00:03:36,208 --> 00:03:38,000
No. I got him like that before.

48
00:03:38,083 --> 00:03:39,250
He'll remember.

You were right to look up

[ALL MIGHT]
In small doses,

79
00:05:02,625 --> 00:05:05,250
pride can be useful
attribute to have.

80
00:05:05,333 --> 00:05:09,291
I'd say you certainly have the
ability to become a pro hero.

I know why you're so
angry, Young Bakugo.

00:05:12,208 --> 00:05:16,250
Because of Young Midoriya's
sudden improvement, right?

83
00:05:16,333 --> 00:05:18,208
But you have to remember
each of your rankings

Why won't you fight back?

having to chase after

97
00:05:54,375 --> 00:05:57,125

so far behind me?

00:05:57,208 --> 00:06:00,541

sidekick? His favorite?

100

You got so much better,
and I destroyed All Might.

I admired him so much.

he ended up losing his power!

Then it never
would have happened.

but hasn't said anything.

Everyone has to know, though!
I can't get it out of my head.

what I thought it would be.

It didn't really matter
who won or lost.

go through with it.

only way he knew how.

I couldn't ignore
him or run off.

Not after everything
we'd been through.

[KATSUKI] I thought you weren't
gonna be my punching bag!

161
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:50,750
[IZUKU]
I'm not!

162
00:08:50,833 --> 00:08:53,375
I bet you've got some kinda
plan up your sleeve.

163
00:08:55,208 --> 00:08:58,041
That's one of the things
I hate most about you!

164
00:08:59,625 --> 00:09:02,583
[KATSUKI] I can never tell
what you're thinking.

165
00:09:02,666 --> 00:09:04,250
No matter how much
I beat you up,

166
00:09:04,333 --> 00:09:06,125
you keep coming back!

167
00:09:06,208 --> 00:09:08,833
It's obvious you've
always looked down on me.

168
00:09:08,916 --> 00:09:11,000
Even when we were kids.

169
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:12,166
[gasps]

170
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:13,750
[KATSUKI]
You think you're better than me.

171
00:09:13,833 --> 00:09:15,291
But if you seriously
believe you're gonna

172
00:09:15,375 --> 00:09:18,375
surpass me as a hero,
even with your new power,

173
00:09:18,458 --> 00:09:20,750
you better think again, Deku!

174
00:09:21,958 --> 00:09:25,708
Wait. Is that what
you actually believed?

175
00:09:25,791 --> 00:09:28,500
All this time?

176
00:09:28,583 --> 00:09:30,541
Think about it, Kacchan.

177
00:09:30,625 --> 00:09:32,666
If I looked down on you,
I wouldn't want anything

178
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:35,000
to do with you anymore.

179
00:09:35,083 --> 00:09:36,666
But I'm still here.

180
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:38,458
I noticed things you
couldn't all these years

181
00:09:38,541 --> 00:09:41,458
because I had nothing at first.

182
00:09:41,541 --> 00:09:44,041
There were things
I hated about you, sure.

183
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:48,083
But I could clearly see
how amazing you were.

184
00:09:48,166 --> 00:09:51,166
You had so much going for
you that I didn't have.

185
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:54,083
All Might was my hero,

186
00:09:54,166 --> 00:09:56,583
but you were the one
actually in my life.

187
00:09:56,666 --> 00:09:59,041
[KATSUKI]
He's faster than before.

188
00:09:59,125 --> 00:10:00,750
[IZUKU]
Because I was so emotional,

189
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:03,458
I lost a bit of control.

190
00:10:03,541 --> 00:10:05,375
I'd been focusing on
keeping my Full Cowling

191
00:10:05,458 --> 00:10:08,125
at five percent power
the entire time.

192
00:10:08,208 --> 00:10:10,208
But I didn't realize how
much stronger my body

193
00:10:10,291 --> 00:10:12,958
had gotten thanks to all
the training and testing.

194
00:10:13,041 --> 00:10:14,958
[KATSUKI]
I can't dodge. Gotta block!

195
00:10:15,041 --> 00:10:16,875
[IZUKU] My continuous
whole-body limit had been

196
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:19,333
raised to eight percent.

197
00:10:20,666 --> 00:10:22,750
[IZUKU] I thought you
were incredible, Kacchan.

198
00:10:22,833 --> 00:10:26,125
I wanted to see...
what you'd become!

199
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:27,958
[grunts]

200
00:10:28,041 --> 00:10:31,833
That's the reason...
I kept chasing after you.

201
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:40,541
[IZUKU] I wasn't prepared for
this new level of speed.

202
00:10:40,625 --> 00:10:43,250
[KATSUKI grunts]

203
00:10:43,333 --> 00:10:45,750
[IZUKU] Going from a continuous
five percent to eight percent

204
00:10:45,833 --> 00:10:48,375
isn't a dramatic change
in the long run.

205
00:10:48,458 --> 00:10:52,166
But with that slight difference,
just for an instant...

206
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:55,875
That's the reason...
I kept chasing after you.

207
00:10:57,291 --> 00:10:59,833
[KATSUKI]
You passed me.

208
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:07,333
[KATSUKI, IZUKU yell]

209
00:11:15,083 --> 00:11:16,750
[IZUKU yelps]

210
00:11:16,833 --> 00:11:17,916
[KATSUKI grunts]

211
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,791
[KATSUKI]
My timing was off on that hit.

212
00:11:19,875 --> 00:11:22,083
He kicked into a higher gear.

213
00:11:22,166 --> 00:11:24,208
Is that all you've got?

214
00:11:24,291 --> 00:11:26,000
[yells]

215
00:11:26,083 --> 00:11:27,500
[IZUKU] I'd never admit
something like this

216
00:11:27,583 --> 00:11:30,541
to your face.
But the truth is...

217
00:11:30,625 --> 00:11:31,916
[IZUKU]
Can't you see?

218
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,250
That's why I wanna beat you!
Because you're amazing!

219
00:11:35,333 --> 00:11:37,458
[IZUKU] When I get riled up
and my desire to win

220
00:11:37,541 --> 00:11:40,875
surpasses my desire
to save someone,

221
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:44,875
without meaning to,
I start talking like you.

222
00:11:44,958 --> 00:11:48,041
You're so mean sometimes.
And I hate it.

223
00:11:48,125 --> 00:11:50,708
But my idea of victory is
so tied to the image of you

224
00:11:50,791 --> 00:11:52,833
in my head that,
in those moments,

225
00:11:52,916 --> 00:11:55,166
I can't help but imitate you.

226
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:57,041
[KATSUKI] I've got the
upper hand in the air.

227
00:11:57,125 --> 00:11:59,791
[IZUKU]
I didn't jump without a plan.

228
00:11:59,875 --> 00:12:01,458
Kacchan thinks he's
got a strong handle

229
00:12:01,541 --> 00:12:03,750
on my new Shoot Style.

230
00:12:03,833 --> 00:12:05,958
But I'm not nice enough
to let him pummel me

231
00:12:06,041 --> 00:12:08,000
just to relieve a little stress.

232
00:12:10,291 --> 00:12:11,875
[IZUKU] The only reason
I'm using my kicks

233
00:12:11,958 --> 00:12:14,625
is so my arms don't
get too abused.

234
00:12:14,708 --> 00:12:17,958
But I never said I couldn't
use them at five percent.

235
00:12:18,041 --> 00:12:19,708
[gasps]

236
00:12:19,791 --> 00:12:23,541
[IZUKU] You're the best.
That's why I want to defeat you!

237
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:28,916
[ALL MIGHT]
Now, it's your turn.

238
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,166
[IZUKU] I have to, in order
to meet the expectations

239
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:34,125
that All Might has for me.

240
00:12:37,291 --> 00:12:38,916
[IZUKU] I'll work until
I have full control

241
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,041
of this borrowed Quirk.

242
00:12:41,125 --> 00:12:43,666
And I'll finally beat you
with my own power!

243
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:50,708
[KATSUKI]
I won't lose to you!

244
00:12:56,916 --> 00:13:04,708
[BOTH panting]

245
00:13:04,791 --> 00:13:07,041
[IZUKU coughs]

246
00:13:07,125 --> 00:13:08,291
[KATSUKI grunts]

247
00:13:10,625 --> 00:13:16,875
That's it. We're done here--
I won this fight.

248
00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:18,916
You have All Might's power,

249
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,708
but even using his strength,
even after making it your own,

250
00:13:22,791 --> 00:13:26,875
somehow you still
managed to lose to me.

251
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:30,375
[panting]

252
00:13:30,458 --> 00:13:31,625
Why?

253
00:13:31,708 --> 00:13:33,458
[panting]

254
00:13:33,541 --> 00:13:35,333
[KATSUKI]
How could you lose?

255
00:13:35,416 --> 00:13:37,750
[coughs]

256
00:13:37,833 --> 00:13:41,416
[ALL MIGHT] Stop this
right now. Both of you.

257
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:44,791
I'm sorry. But I heard
what you've said.

258
00:13:44,875 --> 00:13:46,208
All Might.

259
00:13:46,291 --> 00:13:48,083
When'd you get here?

260
00:13:52,375 --> 00:13:55,708
[ALL MIGHT] I didn't notice
before. I should have.

261
00:13:55,791 --> 00:13:57,708
[KATSUKI]
It's too late now.

262
00:14:00,583 --> 00:14:03,000
[KATSUKI]
Why did you pick Deku?

263
00:14:03,083 --> 00:14:06,041
It started when the sludge
villain came, didn't it?

264
00:14:06,125 --> 00:14:08,083
So why him?

265
00:14:08,166 --> 00:14:10,250
He was powerless.

266
00:14:10,333 --> 00:14:13,125
But still more heroic
than anyone else.

267
00:14:13,208 --> 00:14:16,250
I knew you were strong.
That much was obvious.

268
00:14:16,333 --> 00:14:18,833
You were someone who
could already fight.

269
00:14:18,916 --> 00:14:20,541
So, I decided that he
should have the chance

270
00:14:20,625 --> 00:14:22,416
to stand in the ring.

271
00:14:24,541 --> 00:14:26,875
But now you know
I'm weak, too.

272
00:14:26,958 --> 00:14:28,583
I always wanted to be like you,

273
00:14:28,666 --> 00:14:31,541
which meant being
as strong as possible.

274
00:14:31,625 --> 00:14:34,083
But look what I did to you.

275
00:14:34,166 --> 00:14:36,458
Because I'm not good enough.

276
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:41,208
[ALL MIGHT] This is not
your fault, Young Bakugo.

277
00:14:41,291 --> 00:14:44,250
I was always going
to lose my power.

278
00:14:44,333 --> 00:14:47,291
You couldn't do anything
to change that.

279
00:14:47,375 --> 00:14:48,875
You are strong.

280
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:51,541
But I focused too much
on your physical strength

281
00:14:51,625 --> 00:14:54,166
and overlooked what
was important.

282
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:57,583
This isn't your burden.

283
00:14:57,666 --> 00:14:58,958
I apologize.

284
00:14:59,041 --> 00:15:01,541
Sometimes I forget
that you're children.

285
00:15:07,416 --> 00:15:09,500
After being a hero
for so many years,

286
00:15:09,583 --> 00:15:11,250
you learn a few things.

287
00:15:11,333 --> 00:15:12,916
Striving to be the best,

288
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,666
like you, Young Bakugo.

289
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:16,333
And caring deeply about people--

290
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:20,375
about rescuing those in trouble,
like you, Young Midoriya.

291
00:15:20,458 --> 00:15:23,333
Both of those feelings
are necessary in a hero.

292
00:15:23,416 --> 00:15:27,541
Otherwise, they'll never truly
be able to represent justice.

293
00:15:27,625 --> 00:15:29,583
That's why you admire
his strength so much,

294
00:15:29,666 --> 00:15:32,166
Young Midoriya.

295
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:34,291
And I know that's why you've
always feared his heart

296
00:15:34,375 --> 00:15:37,000
and spirit, Young Bakugo.

297
00:15:37,083 --> 00:15:40,250
Now that you've laid your
feelings out on the table,

298
00:15:40,333 --> 00:15:43,250
maybe you can
understand each other.

299
00:15:43,333 --> 00:15:45,375
If you have mutual
respect and focus on

300
00:15:45,458 --> 00:15:47,458
making one another stronger,

301
00:15:47,541 --> 00:15:50,083
I've no doubt you'll become
the ultimate heroes,

302
00:15:50,166 --> 00:15:53,250
winning and saving people
at the same time.

303
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:02,541
[KATSUKI] Dammit. That's
not what I wanted to hear.

304
00:16:07,291 --> 00:16:09,083
[KATSUKI]
You.

305
00:16:09,166 --> 00:16:10,875
You had the strongest
guy in the world

306
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:13,000
lay the groundwork for you.

307
00:16:13,083 --> 00:16:17,125
Don't you dare lose again.

308
00:16:17,208 --> 00:16:21,375
I'll work harder
so that I can beat you.

309
00:16:23,125 --> 00:16:26,041
[sighs]

310
00:16:26,125 --> 00:16:29,708
Okay, so talk. Who
knows about you two?

311
00:16:29,791 --> 00:16:32,208
Recovery Girl and
Principal Nezu do.

312
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:35,833
As far as students
go... Only you.

313
00:16:35,916 --> 00:16:37,541
And you don't want
this to get out.

314
00:16:37,625 --> 00:16:39,458
'Cause that would be bad.

315
00:16:39,541 --> 00:16:41,708
Don't worry. Your
secret's safe with me.

316
00:16:41,791 --> 00:16:43,958
I won't tell anyone
what's going on.

317
00:16:44,041 --> 00:16:46,708
Unlike Deku, I can
keep my mouth shut.

318
00:16:46,791 --> 00:16:49,666
This will stay between us.

319
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:51,958
Thanks, Kacchan.

320
00:16:52,041 --> 00:16:53,625
I don't deserve this.

321
00:16:53,708 --> 00:16:55,791
I should be down on my hands
and knees begging for you

322
00:16:55,875 --> 00:16:57,833
to keep this secret for me.

323
00:16:57,916 --> 00:16:59,458
Yet here you are,
being considerate

324
00:16:59,541 --> 00:17:02,791
and helping me out. Thank you.

325
00:17:02,875 --> 00:17:05,750
I'm not doing this for you.
It would just be a real pain

326
00:17:05,833 --> 00:17:08,625
if this got out and
messed stuff up.

327
00:17:08,708 --> 00:17:10,083
[ALL MIGHT]
Now that it's come to this,

328
00:17:10,166 --> 00:17:11,666
I can explain what
happened between

329
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:13,250
me and Young Midoriya.

330
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:14,958
That's only fair.

331
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,833
[IZUKU] And so, All Might told
Kacchan the whole backstory.

332
00:17:19,916 --> 00:17:22,083
About the power passed
down through generations

333
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:25,041
in order to be used
against great evil.

334
00:17:25,125 --> 00:17:26,958
About how he used
that power to become

335
00:17:27,041 --> 00:17:29,291
the Symbol of Peace.

336
00:17:29,375 --> 00:17:33,625
How he was gravely injured,
which limited his strength.

337
00:17:33,708 --> 00:17:38,083
And finally... how he
chose his successor.

338
00:17:38,166 --> 00:17:40,125
[KATSUKI] If this got out
people'd be confused,

339
00:17:40,208 --> 00:17:42,458
and they'd start wondering
where the power is.

340
00:17:42,541 --> 00:17:44,000
You idiot. What
were you thinking

341
00:17:44,083 --> 00:17:46,250
when you first told me about it?

342
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:48,916
[ALL MIGHT]
It was my own choice

343
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,833
to use up the last
of my abilities.

344
00:17:50,916 --> 00:17:53,125
I said this earlier, but...

345
00:17:53,208 --> 00:17:55,833
That was in no way your fault.

346
00:17:55,916 --> 00:17:58,375
[KATSUKI]
Yeah. Sure.

347
00:17:58,458 --> 00:18:00,958
[KATSUKI] It doesn't change
what I have to do.

348
00:18:01,041 --> 00:18:03,041
I'm gonna end up being
the number-one hero

349
00:18:03,125 --> 00:18:04,750
no matter what!

350
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:07,583
True. You're right about that.

351
00:18:07,666 --> 00:18:09,875
Things aren't gonna be
the same, though, Deku.

352
00:18:09,958 --> 00:18:12,166
You got that?

353
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:14,083
You've been watching me
and everyone around you,

354
00:18:14,166 --> 00:18:16,708
absorbing what you see
to get stronger.

355
00:18:16,791 --> 00:18:18,458
Well, I can do
the exact same thing

356
00:18:18,541 --> 00:18:20,708
and keep getting better myself.

357
00:18:20,791 --> 00:18:23,958
I'll go higher than
even you, Chosen One.

358
00:18:25,458 --> 00:18:27,166
Right, then I guess
I'll just have

359
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:28,416
to be better than that.

360
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:29,375
You what?

361
00:18:29,458 --> 00:18:31,000
I have to go higher than you.

362
00:18:31,083 --> 00:18:33,041
[KATSUKI grunts]
Dammit, nerd.

363
00:18:33,125 --> 00:18:35,541
I just said I was gonna
be the one to surpass you.

364
00:18:35,625 --> 00:18:37,041
[IZUKU]
I know!

365
00:18:37,125 --> 00:18:38,833
And now I'm saying that I'm
gonna go beyond that level.

366
00:18:38,916 --> 00:18:40,583
[KATSUKI]
What?!

367
00:18:40,666 --> 00:18:42,916
[ALL MIGHT] They've become
proper rivals now.

368
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,083
In a way that they
weren't before.

369
00:18:47,375 --> 00:18:49,708
[IZUKU] The secret between
me and All Might

370
00:18:49,791 --> 00:18:52,375
became a secret the
three of us shared.

371
00:18:56,166 --> 00:18:57,875
[IZUKU]
And then...

372
00:18:57,958 --> 00:18:59,375
[AIZAWA] You fought the
night you finished

373
00:18:59,458 --> 00:19:02,166
the preliminary
hero licensing exam?

374
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:05,291
I'm glad to see that you
two have so much energy.

375
00:19:05,375 --> 00:19:07,708
Aizawa, wait, hold up
with those restraints.

376
00:19:07,791 --> 00:19:09,541
It's my fault that they
sparred in the first place.

377
00:19:09,625 --> 00:19:11,000
Huh?

378
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:13,166
[AIZAWA]
Midoriya and Bakugo.

379
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:15,625
Why am I not surprised
to hear that.

380
00:19:15,708 --> 00:19:18,000
I understand they're
at the practice field.

381
00:19:18,083 --> 00:19:21,625
Yes. I wanted to catch
you before you went.

382
00:19:21,708 --> 00:19:24,833
I've known these two since
before they came to UA.

383
00:19:24,916 --> 00:19:27,250
And I've given the pair
quite a bit of thought.

384
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:29,750
Will you leave them
to me for now?

385
00:19:29,833 --> 00:19:31,625
I'll bring them back.

386
00:19:31,708 --> 00:19:33,791
Your fault? And how is that?

387
00:19:33,875 --> 00:19:35,333
[IZUKU, KATSUKI yelp]

388
00:19:35,416 --> 00:19:37,083
[ALL MIGHT] It seems Young
Bakugo has been feeling

389
00:19:37,166 --> 00:19:39,333
like he was responsible
for my retirement.

390
00:19:39,416 --> 00:19:41,000
He had to face
the licensing exam

391
00:19:41,083 --> 00:19:43,750
with those pent-up emotions and
then his inferiority complex

392
00:19:43,833 --> 00:19:45,875
exploded and this happened.

393
00:19:45,958 --> 00:19:48,583
It's all because I didn't
realize I was being negligent.

394
00:19:48,666 --> 00:19:50,041
This whole fight
was brought about

395
00:19:50,125 --> 00:19:52,458
because of the failure
of his teacher.

396
00:19:52,541 --> 00:19:53,958
[AIZAWA grunts]

397
00:19:55,041 --> 00:19:56,500
[AIZAWA]
I understand that they felt

398
00:19:56,583 --> 00:19:58,500
they had to break the rules.

399
00:19:58,583 --> 00:20:00,958
But this isn't something
I can just ignore.

400
00:20:01,041 --> 00:20:03,291
There must be a
suitable punishment.

401
00:20:03,375 --> 00:20:05,708
Who threw the first punch?

402
00:20:05,791 --> 00:20:06,916
I did.

403
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,000
I also went pretty hard.
It wasn't just him.

404
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:11,375
You're both on house arrest.

405
00:20:11,458 --> 00:20:13,875
Four days for Bakugo,
and three for Midoriya.

406
00:20:13,958 --> 00:20:15,791
During that time, you'll
clean all the common areas

407
00:20:15,875 --> 00:20:17,208
in the dorm, morning and night.

408
00:20:17,291 --> 00:20:19,416
Plus, I want a written apology.

409
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:20,916
If your injuries need
to be checked out,

410
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,291
head to the infirmary.

411
00:20:22,375 --> 00:20:24,666
But don't rely on the
old lady's Quirk this time.

412
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:27,333
Figure out a way
to heal yourselves.

413
00:20:27,416 --> 00:20:30,125
[sighs]

414
00:20:30,208 --> 00:20:32,250
[AIZAWA]
That's all! Go.

415
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:04,791
[STUDENTS]
What?

416
00:22:04,875 --> 00:22:06,083
You guys threw down?

417
00:22:06,166 --> 00:22:07,541
[HAGAKURE] And now you're
under house arrest?

418
00:22:07,625 --> 00:22:08,541
[KAMINARI]
Hilarious.

419
00:22:08,625 --> 00:22:09,416
[AOYAMA]
<i>Tres tragique</i> .

420
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:10,500
[SERO]
You're both morons.

421
00:22:10,583 --> 00:22:11,750
[TOKOYAMI]
The pinnacle of stupidity.

422
00:22:11,833 --> 00:22:13,125
[KATSUKI growls]

423
00:22:13,208 --> 00:22:15,458
So, did you guys
make up after or...?

424
00:22:15,541 --> 00:22:18,708
[IZUKU] Well, it wasn't
that we made up, exactly.

425
00:22:18,791 --> 00:22:21,708
Hm... It's kinda hard
to put into words.

426
00:22:21,791 --> 00:22:23,916
You're lucky you two got
away with house arrest.

427
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Though this does mean you'll
miss the opening ceremony

428
00:22:26,083 --> 00:22:27,375
we're going to right now.

429
00:22:27,458 --> 00:22:30,416
Bakugo. What about
our extra classes?

430
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:33,083
Shut up, Icy Hot! This has
nothing to do with you.

431
00:22:33,166 --> 00:22:34,625
[KAMINARI] 'Kay, well,
thanks for cleaning up!

[KATSUKI growls]

00:22:47,833 --> 00:22:51,791
[IZUKU]
So... about my Shoot Style.

434

What did you think of it?

435
00:23:03,291 --> 00:23:06,500
[KATSUKI]
Your movements are too obvious.

436
00:23:06,583 --> 00:23:09,541
Even when you got faster,
I was able to dodge them.

437
00:23:09,625 --> 00:23:12,125
You're not gonna win
any fight that way.

438

Oh. Right.

439
00:23:16,958 --> 00:23:18,125
[KATSUKI]
And when you added in punches,

440
00:23:18,208 --> 00:23:20,125
it really pissed me off.

Got it.

443
00:23:29,375 --> 00:23:30,666
[IZUKU]
Here's the preview!

444
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:33,041
UA High's second
semester has begun.

445
00:23:33,125 --> 00:23:35,375
After the Hosu Incident,
the training camp,

446
00:23:35,458 --> 00:23:37,458
and the provisional
licensing exam,

447
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:39,333
we've all grown quite a bit.

448
00:23:39,416 --> 00:23:40,916
Now it's time to show
off what we can do

449
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,375
in our work studies!

450
00:23:42,458 --> 00:23:44,416
Unfortunately, with
All Might's retirement,

451
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:46,458
a lot of the villains who've
been hiding in the shadows

452
00:23:46,541 --> 00:23:49,416
are starting to become
much more active.

453
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:51,916
Next time: "A Season
for Encounters"!

454
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,833
This is the story of how
I met the Big Three

455
00:23:53,916 --> 00:23:55,541
who rank at the top of UA.

456
00:23:55,625 --> 00:23:58,458
Go beyond! Plus Ultra!
