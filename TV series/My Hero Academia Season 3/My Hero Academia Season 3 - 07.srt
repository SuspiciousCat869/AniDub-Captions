I captured Bakugo with a simple

00:00:11,083 --> 00:00:13,291
slight-of-hand magic trick.

[TODOROKI]
Damn it, this guy's quick.

4
00:00:16,666 --> 00:00:20,000
[IZUKU]
We can't give up. Not now.

5
00:00:20,083 --> 00:00:24,166
We have to catch him
and get our friends back.

6
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:27,041
[TSUYU] Make sure you've
got a good grip on them.

[TWICE]
Whoa, whoa, what's this?

10
00:00:35,458 --> 00:00:38,166
Oh, hey, wait,
I know these kids.

11
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:39,500
Who are they?

12
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:44,000
[IZUKU] Welcome to UA High,
the prestigious school

13
00:00:44,083 --> 00:00:47,125
that's turned out some of
the world's greatest heroes.

14
00:00:47,208 --> 00:00:49,291
I'm running toward my
dream in these halls.

15
00:00:49,375 --> 00:00:51,458
Learning to overcome
obstacles and save people

16
00:00:51,541 --> 00:00:53,875
with a smile on my face.

17
00:00:53,958 --> 00:00:57,041
That's how I'll become the
greatest hero in the world!

18
00:02:31,041 --> 00:02:33,208
[IZUKU] While we were trying
to protect Kacchan,

19
00:02:33,291 --> 00:02:35,541
our classmates had their
own problems back at camp

20
00:02:35,625 --> 00:02:37,791
immediately following
Mandalay's message.

21
00:02:37,875 --> 00:02:40,333
[KIRISHIMA] Come on! You heard
what she said, didn't you?

22
00:02:40,416 --> 00:02:42,083
I can't let them get my friend.

23
00:02:42,166 --> 00:02:43,916
You gotta let me go
find him, please!

24
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:44,958
Not a chance.

25
00:02:45,041 --> 00:02:46,000
[KIRISHIMA]
But why not?

26
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:47,583
[ASHIDO]
Come on! Cool it, Kirishima.

27
00:02:47,666 --> 00:02:48,791
Excuse me!

28
00:02:48,875 --> 00:02:50,208
We don't know how many
villains there are.

29
00:02:50,291 --> 00:02:52,083
Shouldn't we have as many
fighters as possible?

30
00:02:52,166 --> 00:02:54,416
You can't seriously
wanna face the bad guys!

31
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:57,833
Iida gets it. Even
Mr. Aizawa said to fight.

32
00:02:57,916 --> 00:02:59,708
Only for self-defense.

33
00:02:59,791 --> 00:03:02,041
He meant the students
in the woods.

34

Was that the door?

37
00:03:07,416 --> 00:03:09,416
I guess Mr. Aizawa
is back already.

38
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:11,000
Finally. He'll understand.

39
00:03:11,083 --> 00:03:13,250
[VLAD KING]
No, wait.

40
00:03:13,333 --> 00:03:14,458
Move!

41
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:18,041
Everyone. Get back!

42
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:24,125
[gasps] No way!

43
00:03:24,208 --> 00:03:26,958
That's the guy who
got creamed earlier!

44
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:28,541
[VLAD KING]
You're too slow!

45
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:32,583
Blood Control.

46
00:03:32,666 --> 00:03:33,666
It's so strong!

47
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:35,833
Just as I'd expect
from our teacher!

48
00:03:35,916 --> 00:03:39,458
You dare walk into my classroom
without so much as a plan?

49
00:03:39,541 --> 00:03:41,458
You underestimate us.

50
00:03:41,541 --> 00:03:42,833
[DABI]
Are you sure about that?

51
00:03:42,916 --> 00:03:43,958
[VLAD KING]
Mm?

52
00:03:44,041 --> 00:03:46,708
You're acting exactly
like I expected.

53
00:03:46,791 --> 00:03:48,125
You've already been defeated,

54
00:03:48,208 --> 00:03:50,375
regardless of what
happens to me.

55
00:03:50,458 --> 00:03:53,375
The two most trusted pillars
of the superhuman society

56
00:03:53,458 --> 00:03:54,708
are linked together.

57

of hero education,

[VLAD KING gasps]

60
00:04:01,416 --> 00:04:03,000
[DABI] But embarrassing
incidents have damaged

61
00:04:03,083 --> 00:04:05,083
the world's trust in you both.

62
00:04:05,166 --> 00:04:07,541
Sloppy management keeps
allowing villains

63
00:04:07,625 --> 00:04:09,458
to slip in and attack.

64
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:10,708
People are so shaken

65
00:04:10,791 --> 00:04:13,166
that they've almost lost
all faith in you.

66
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:15,000
Imagine how they'll react
when they find out

67
00:04:15,083 --> 00:04:17,125
you let a student get kidnapped.

68
00:04:17,208 --> 00:04:19,625
You shut up! That's
not gonna happen.

69
00:04:19,708 --> 00:04:20,833
Not our classmate!

70
00:04:20,916 --> 00:04:22,166
Not while we're here!

71
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:23,833
[DABI]
Don't be naive.

72
00:04:23,916 --> 00:04:26,125
It only took a handful
of us to separate you

73
00:04:26,208 --> 00:04:28,333
from the pros and start
picking you off.

74
00:04:28,416 --> 00:04:29,416
That's enough!

trying to provoke you.

79
00:04:36,916 --> 00:04:38,000
He won't talk.

80
00:04:38,083 --> 00:04:40,875
Uh, Mr. Aizawa,
I think you got him.

81
00:04:40,958 --> 00:04:42,958
[AIZAWA]
Look at him. Another fake.

82
00:04:43,041 --> 00:04:44,500
I fought one before.

83
00:04:44,583 --> 00:04:45,750
He wasn't real?

84
00:04:45,833 --> 00:04:47,791
It must be a villain's Quirk.

[VLAD KING] Eraser.
What's it like out there?

86
00:04:50,083 --> 00:04:52,208
[AIZAWA] Hard to say.
I left to direct our defense,

87
00:04:52,291 --> 00:04:54,541
but I ended up
taking care of Kota.

88
00:04:54,625 --> 00:04:56,875
Look after him while I
go back to the front line.

89
00:04:56,958 --> 00:04:59,166
I'm counting on you to
keep defending this place.

90
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:00,375
Is that wise?

91
00:05:00,458 --> 00:05:02,375
We hardly know
anything about them.

92
00:05:02,458 --> 00:05:04,208
[AIZAWA]
You'll be just fine by yourself.

93
00:05:04,291 --> 00:05:07,541
The other copy of him I fought
earlier used the same attack.

94
00:05:07,625 --> 00:05:08,958
I think their
strategy is to send

95
00:05:09,041 --> 00:05:10,875
their strongest fighters here
to keep our attention

96
00:05:10,958 --> 00:05:12,291
since we're the pros.

97
00:05:12,375 --> 00:05:14,125
That's how they're trying
to disguise the fact

98
00:05:14,208 --> 00:05:15,791
that there are so few
of them out there.

99
00:05:15,875 --> 00:05:18,250
If there aren't many, then
we should be fighting, too!

100
00:05:18,333 --> 00:05:20,375
Yes! You need
strength in numbers!

101
00:05:20,458 --> 00:05:21,958
[AIZAWA]
No!

102
00:05:22,041 --> 00:05:24,541
If they're not here for us,
then they're after the students.

103
00:05:24,625 --> 00:05:25,791
We know about Bakugo,

104
00:05:25,875 --> 00:05:28,583
but they might be
targeting others as well.

105
00:05:28,666 --> 00:05:31,875
We're still sorely
lacking in information.

106
00:05:31,958 --> 00:05:33,666
The only way we win this

107
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:36,375
is by making sure you
students are protected.

[TOGA] I've been thinking
since I saw you...

123
00:06:19,708 --> 00:06:21,166
...that you'd be so much cuter

little more! I can help!

You want to come between us?

To be honest, you're
not really my type.

But I'll cut you anyway.

Ugh.

You got Bakugo?

139
00:07:02,083 --> 00:07:03,666
[MR. COMPRESS]
Of course.

140
00:07:05,416 --> 00:07:07,083
[MR. COMPRESS]
Huh?

141
00:07:07,166 --> 00:07:09,916
[SHOJI]
Midoriya. Todoroki. We're done!

142
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,208
He gave away his best trick.

143
00:07:12,291 --> 00:07:14,291
I'm not sure what your Quirk is,

144
00:07:14,375 --> 00:07:16,791
but it had to do with those
little marbles, right?

145
00:07:16,875 --> 00:07:19,291
The ones you'd stashed
in your pocket.

146
00:07:19,375 --> 00:07:22,291
So I'm guessing these
are Tokoyami and Bakugo.

147

You rescued them!

Well, color me impressed.

149

Just as I'd expect from
someone with so many hands.

150
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:30,916
How splendid.

151
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,708
Right. Nice job, Shoji.

Not this guy.

He was at the USJ.

I agree. Every news outlet
is currently condemning UA High.

If Bakugo was one
of the main targets,

262
00:13:26,583 --> 00:13:28,333
it's likely because

The man looked to be in his 20s,

00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,750
but we didn't find
any plausible matches

when we checked
criminal records.

320
00:15:34,916 --> 00:15:37,208
We spoke with the owner
of the building, though,

321
00:15:37,291 --> 00:15:39,916
and found that there's
a sort of hidden bar there.

322
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,416
My man thought
this was unrelated

323
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:44,375
to our kidnapping case,
and didn't investigate further.

But remember the
description of that villain

from the attack?
He had a patchwork face.

we get the green light.

where I slipped in and out of
consciousness for two days.

I suffered from seizures,
