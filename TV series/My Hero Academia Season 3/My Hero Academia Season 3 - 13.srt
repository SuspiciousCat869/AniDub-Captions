00:00:10,416 --> 00:00:13,000
[IZUKU] Welcome to UA High,
the prestigious school

2
00:00:13,083 --> 00:00:16,125
that's turned out some of
the world's greatest heroes.

3
00:00:16,208 --> 00:00:18,250
I'm running toward my
dream in these halls.

4
00:00:18,333 --> 00:00:19,666
Learning to overcome obstacles

5
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:22,875
and save people with
a smile on my face.

6
00:00:22,958 --> 00:00:26,083
That's how I'll become the
greatest hero in the world!

7
00:01:58,583 --> 00:02:01,333
[ALL MIGHT] Will you allow me
to devote myself to Young Izuku?

8
00:02:01,416 --> 00:02:03,166
Together, we will go beyond.

9
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:04,666
I will lift him up.

10
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:09,791
And I will protect your son,
even if it costs me my life.

11
00:02:09,875 --> 00:02:10,708
[sighs]

12
00:02:10,791 --> 00:02:13,000
[gasps] Are you okay?!

13
00:02:17,166 --> 00:02:20,291
[IZUKU'S MOM]
I can't. I mean...

14
00:02:21,708 --> 00:02:24,750
[IZUKU'S MOM] You're
Izuku's reason for living.

15
00:02:25,833 --> 00:02:26,833
All Might.

16
00:02:26,916 --> 00:02:30,125
Don't give up your life.
He needs you.

17
00:02:30,208 --> 00:02:33,250
To protect him. Raise him.

18
00:02:33,333 --> 00:02:34,958
If you can promise me
you'll do that,

19
00:02:35,041 --> 00:02:37,583
then he can return to UA.

20
00:02:39,083 --> 00:02:40,791
Oh, Mom!

21
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:45,416
[ALL MIGHT]
I promise.

22
00:02:47,958 --> 00:02:49,166
[IZUKU'S MOM]
Izuku.

23
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:51,166
If you're going to go
back to this school,

24
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:53,625
you have to be so careful.

25
00:02:55,125 --> 00:02:58,083
Of course. I won't
make you worry.

26
00:02:59,833 --> 00:03:01,833
[IZUKU'S MOM]
That look on your face.

27
00:03:01,916 --> 00:03:06,166
You're so grown.
While I wasn't looking,

28
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:11,041
the hero you admire so much
actually began to admire you.

29
00:03:11,125 --> 00:03:14,875
I'm proud of you,
too, Izuku. My baby.

30
00:03:14,958 --> 00:03:17,083
I hope that knowing
how whole-heartedly

31
00:03:17,166 --> 00:03:20,166
he respects you
makes you happy, son.

32
00:03:22,833 --> 00:03:26,208
[ALL MIGHT] She entrusted
you to my care, Young Midoriya.

33
00:03:26,291 --> 00:03:28,000
She wants me to be a mentor.

34
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:33,250
To act like a natural-born hero
instead of the Symbol of Peace.

35
00:03:33,333 --> 00:03:35,375
[ALL MIGHT]
You have a really good mother.

36
00:03:36,541 --> 00:03:37,875
I do.

37
00:03:37,958 --> 00:03:39,541
You know,

38
00:03:39,625 --> 00:03:41,583
she reminds me
of my predecessor.

39
00:03:41,666 --> 00:03:44,416
[IZUKU]
She does? Wait, how so?

40
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:45,833
It's the hairstyle.

41
00:03:45,916 --> 00:03:48,208
[IZUKU]
O-Oh, sure.

42
00:03:49,541 --> 00:03:52,125
And she's got the
mighty heart of a hero!

43
00:03:52,208 --> 00:03:54,750
[WOMAN 51A] Ew. Look at
that walking skeleton!

44
00:03:54,833 --> 00:03:56,000
[ALL MIGHT gasps]
Crap.

45
00:03:56,083 --> 00:03:58,458
Now everyone recognizes
me in this form, too.

46
00:03:58,541 --> 00:03:59,916
I forgot.

47
00:04:01,166 --> 00:04:02,208
[ALL MIGHT]
Well, see you at school.

48
00:04:02,291 --> 00:04:03,500
Right. Cool!

49
00:04:07,458 --> 00:04:10,166
[IZUKU] After my mother
gave me permission,

50
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:13,833
I left home and
started a new life.

51
00:04:48,666 --> 00:04:50,541
[IZUKU]
On the edge of UA's campus,

52
00:04:50,625 --> 00:04:52,875
about a five-minute walk
from the main school,

53
00:04:52,958 --> 00:04:54,791
they built a student dorm.

54
00:04:54,875 --> 00:04:58,041
Heights Alliance, constructed
in just three days.

55
00:04:58,125 --> 00:05:02,541
This was my--no-- <i>our</i> new home.

56
00:05:10,375 --> 00:05:12,083
[NEZU] The new dorm
system we put into place

57
00:05:12,166 --> 00:05:15,208
isn't just to ensure the
safety of our students.

58
00:05:15,291 --> 00:05:17,250
It's also how we're addressing
one of the threats

59
00:05:17,333 --> 00:05:20,500
we've yet to take
care of. The leak.

60
00:05:20,583 --> 00:05:23,250
A feeling of unease has
settled upon our school.

61
00:05:23,333 --> 00:05:25,541
To help alleviate that,
we'll be holding a private,

62
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:28,583
behind-the-scenes investigation.

63
00:05:28,666 --> 00:05:31,333
It pains me to suspect
not just the teachers,

64
00:05:31,416 --> 00:05:33,166
but the students as well.

65
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:36,500
Unfortunately, right now,
I have no other choice.

66
00:05:36,583 --> 00:05:38,833
We've lost the Symbol of Peace.

67
00:05:38,916 --> 00:05:40,500
And I have no doubt
that this will have

68
00:05:40,583 --> 00:05:43,791
big ramifications on
us as time passes.

69
00:05:43,875 --> 00:05:45,166
What UA needs right now

70
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:48,250
is positive energy
and revitalization.

71
00:05:48,333 --> 00:05:49,500
We must remind the children

72
00:05:49,583 --> 00:05:51,833
that there's a bright
future ahead of them

73
00:05:51,916 --> 00:05:54,625
despite what they've endured.

74
00:05:54,708 --> 00:05:56,625
[AIZAWA] Given everything
that has happened,

75
00:05:56,708 --> 00:05:59,333
I'm glad we were able to
bring Class A back together.

76
00:05:59,416 --> 00:06:01,958
So, we all got the go ahead
to move on-campus.

77
00:06:02,041 --> 00:06:05,125
[HAGAKURE sighs] It took a lot
of convincing for my parents.

78
00:06:05,208 --> 00:06:07,000
I was pretty concerned
about mine.

79
00:06:07,083 --> 00:06:08,166
It makes sense.

80
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:10,083
You got the worst
of the gas attack.

81
00:06:10,166 --> 00:06:12,833
We're glad to see the teachers
got to come back, too.

82
00:06:12,916 --> 00:06:14,666
I was afraid you
wouldn't be allowed.

83
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:16,166
The people at the
press conference seemed

84
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:17,583
pretty upset with you guys.

85
00:06:17,666 --> 00:06:18,875
Yeah.

86
00:06:18,958 --> 00:06:20,791
[AIZAWA]
I was surprised, as well.

87
00:06:20,875 --> 00:06:23,625
But circumstances have changed.

88
00:06:23,708 --> 00:06:25,916
[AIZAWA] I suspect it was
easier for administration

89
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,708
to let the teachers
return instead of

90
00:06:27,791 --> 00:06:30,666
revamping the entire faculty.

91
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:32,166
Now, then.

92
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:35,083
I'll explain how your dorm
assignments will work shortly.

93
00:06:35,166 --> 00:06:36,875
First, however...

94
00:06:36,958 --> 00:06:39,625
We haven't forgotten about the
provisional hero licenses

95
00:06:39,708 --> 00:06:41,916
you were supposed to get
during the training camp.

96
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,458
[SATO] Oh, yeah! That's
what we were there for.

97
00:06:44,541 --> 00:06:47,500
[ASHIDO] So much has happened,
it totally slipped my mind.

98
00:06:47,583 --> 00:06:50,416
[AIZAWA]
This is important. Listen well.

99
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:54,375
Kirishima. Yaoyorozu. Todoroki.

100
00:06:54,458 --> 00:06:57,708
Midoriya. Iida.

101
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:59,666
You five are the ones
who broke the rules

102
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:02,083
and went to rescue
Bakugo that night.

103
00:07:02,166 --> 00:07:03,916
Ribbit.

104
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:08,250
Based on your reactions,

105
00:07:08,333 --> 00:07:11,500
I assume the rest of you were
at least aware of their plan.

106
00:07:13,791 --> 00:07:15,666
[AIZAWA] I'm going to set
aside a number of issues

107
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:17,500
and just say this.

108
00:07:17,583 --> 00:07:20,916
If it weren't for All Might's
retirement from the Hero scene,

109
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,875
I would expel everyone here

110
00:07:22,958 --> 00:07:25,875
except Bakugo, Jiro,
and Hagakure.

111
00:07:26,958 --> 00:07:29,333
[AIZAWA] The five of you
who went, of course.

112
00:07:29,416 --> 00:07:32,250
But also the remaining 12
who didn't stop them.

113
00:07:32,333 --> 00:07:33,791
You betrayed our trust.

114
00:07:33,875 --> 00:07:35,250
Even if it was to
keep your friends

115
00:07:35,333 --> 00:07:36,875
from getting into trouble.

116
00:07:36,958 --> 00:07:39,166
In order to regain
our confidence,

117
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:41,291
you'll need to obey
every rule to the letter,

118
00:07:41,375 --> 00:07:44,041
and live as model students.

119
00:07:44,125 --> 00:07:45,083
That's all.

120
00:07:45,166 --> 00:07:48,958
Now. Look alive.
Enjoy your new home.

121
00:07:49,041 --> 00:07:50,250
[SERO, KAMINARI]
Uh.

122
00:07:50,333 --> 00:07:52,791
We're supposed to be
excited after that speech?

123
00:07:57,375 --> 00:07:59,000
[KATSUKI]
Tch.

124
00:07:59,083 --> 00:08:00,083
Come here.

125
00:08:00,166 --> 00:08:02,708
[KAMINARI]
Uh-- Huh? Wait. For what?

126
00:08:02,791 --> 00:08:05,125
[KAMINARI yells]

127
00:08:05,208 --> 00:08:07,666
Yay, yay, yay, yay, yay.

128
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:10,291
Dude. What'd Bakugo do to you?

129
00:08:10,375 --> 00:08:11,791
Kirishima!

130
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:15,291
[KIRISHIMA] Whoa, did you
shake him down for cash?!

131
00:08:15,375 --> 00:08:17,875
[KATSUKI]
No! This is my money, you idiot.

132
00:08:17,958 --> 00:08:19,708
To replace what you spent.

133
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:24,041
Uh. How'd you know I bought
night vision goggles?

134
00:08:25,583 --> 00:08:27,500
[KATSUKI] Don't say I
never gave you anything.

135
00:08:27,583 --> 00:08:29,500
Now I'm not in your debt.

136
00:08:29,583 --> 00:08:32,000
Kaminari, show 'em
your dumb side.

137
00:08:32,083 --> 00:08:36,208
[JIRO] Oh, man. What a moron.
You're so hopeless.

138
00:08:36,291 --> 00:08:39,000
[KAMINARI yelling]

139
00:08:39,083 --> 00:08:43,250
--[STUDENTS laughing]
--[SERO] It isn't funny, guys!

140
00:08:43,333 --> 00:08:44,916
[KIRISHIMA]
Thanks, man.

141
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,500
[AIZAWA]
Sometimes blowing off steam

142
00:08:47,583 --> 00:08:50,000
is the best thing
to do, I guess.

143
00:08:50,083 --> 00:08:51,000
[KIRISHIMA]
Sorry, everyone!

144
00:08:51,083 --> 00:08:52,458
I know this won't
make up for it,

145
00:08:52,541 --> 00:08:54,666
but let's all go out
to eat tonight on me!

146
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:55,750
[STUDENTS cheer]

147
00:08:55,833 --> 00:08:58,250
[KAMINARI]
Yay!

148
00:09:02,791 --> 00:09:05,500
[AIZAWA] Each student
dormitory holds one class.

149
00:09:05,583 --> 00:09:08,458
Girls are on the right
and boys are on the left.

150
00:09:08,541 --> 00:09:10,916
The entire first floor
is a common area.

151
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,458
That's where you'll
find your kitchen,

152
00:09:12,541 --> 00:09:14,458
baths, and laundry rooms.

153
00:09:14,541 --> 00:09:15,583
[HAGAKURE]
Ah!

154
00:09:15,666 --> 00:09:16,833
There's even a courtyard.

155
00:09:16,916 --> 00:09:19,750
So spacious and new! [laughs]

156
00:09:19,833 --> 00:09:21,458
I'm living in a mansion.

157
00:09:21,541 --> 00:09:23,458
Uraraka!

158

[MINETA]
Doth mine ears deceive me?

159
00:09:25,791 --> 00:09:29,125
Our baths... are located
in the common space?

160
00:09:29,208 --> 00:09:31,458
[gulps] Is this heaven?

161
00:09:31,541 --> 00:09:33,250
[AIZAWA]
They're separated by gender,

162
00:09:33,333 --> 00:09:35,166
and you'll behave yourself.

163
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:36,750
Yes, sir.

164
00:09:36,833 --> 00:09:38,875
[AIZAWA] Living quarters
start on the next floor.

165
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:41,583
A few boys and girls
on each level.

166
00:09:41,666 --> 00:09:43,291
Everyone gets their own room.

167
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:44,708
You should be comfortable.

168
00:09:44,791 --> 00:09:48,208
You've got your own AC,
toilets, fridges, and closets.

169
00:09:48,291 --> 00:09:50,625
We have balconies?! Wow!

170
00:09:50,708 --> 00:09:53,208
This room is about the same
size as my closet at home,

171
00:09:53,291 --> 00:09:54,375
but I'll manage.

172
00:09:54,458 --> 00:09:55,791
[OCHACO]
It's the size of my house!

173
00:09:55,875 --> 00:09:57,333
Uraraka!

174
00:09:57,416 --> 00:09:59,041
[AIZAWA]
These are your dorm assignments.

175
00:09:59,125 --> 00:10:01,250
The belongings you sent ahead
have already been placed

176
00:10:01,333 --> 00:10:03,541
in your new rooms,
so spend the day unpacking

177
00:10:03,625 --> 00:10:05,250
and getting settled.

178
00:10:05,333 --> 00:10:08,083
I'll tell you more about your
next few lessons tomorrow.

179
00:10:08,166 --> 00:10:09,833
For now, get to work.

180
00:10:09,916 --> 00:10:11,708
[STUDENTS]
Yes, Mr. Aizawa!

181
00:10:13,916 --> 00:10:16,166
[KIRISHIMA]
Ah, I'm so beat.

182
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:18,875
[SERO] You and me both.
You done unpacking?

183
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:19,875
I think so.

184
00:10:19,958 --> 00:10:21,250
Feels good, right?

185
00:10:21,333 --> 00:10:22,750
I know we could've died.

186
00:10:22,833 --> 00:10:24,791
But it's kind of exciting
to be living here.

187
00:10:24,875 --> 00:10:25,625
[IZUKU]
Mm-hm!

188
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:27,208
A unified class.

189
00:10:27,291 --> 00:10:29,666
It's the perfect way to increase
our cooperation and discipline.

190
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:30,500
How smart!

191
00:10:30,583 --> 00:10:32,166
So you never relax, do you?

192
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:34,750
[ASHIDO] Hiya, boys.
All done with your rooms?

193
00:10:34,833 --> 00:10:36,458
Yup, we're just unwinding now.

194
00:10:36,541 --> 00:10:38,833
Well, the girls and I
have been talking and...

195
00:10:38,916 --> 00:10:40,958
[HAGAKURE]
We have a great idea!

196
00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:44,000
Let's go around and see
who has the coolest room!

197
00:10:45,291 --> 00:10:47,791
[screams] No, wait,
you can't go in there!

198
00:10:47,875 --> 00:10:49,208
Please, it's not fit for--

199

[GIRLS squeal]

200
00:10:50,375 --> 00:10:52,416
[OCHACO]
It's All Might everywhere!

201
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,041
You're such a fanboy!

202
00:10:54,125 --> 00:10:56,416
[IZUKU]
Well, I admire him...

203
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:57,916
This is embarrassing.

204
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Does this mean...

205
00:10:59,083 --> 00:11:00,416
...they're judging
our rooms, too?

206
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:02,958
Probably, could
end up a good time.

207
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,125
No way.

208
00:11:13,666 --> 00:11:15,208
[ASHIDO, HAGAKURE]
So dark and scary!

209
00:11:15,291 --> 00:11:16,958
[TOKOYAMI]
You fiends.

210
00:11:17,041 --> 00:11:18,833
[KIRISHIMA] Oh, man,
I had a keychain like this

211
00:11:18,916 --> 00:11:20,166
when I was in middle school.

212
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:22,166
So this is how boys
like to decorate.

213
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:23,791
[TOKOYAMI]
Please leave.

214
00:11:23,875 --> 00:11:26,083
A sword?! So cool!

215
00:11:26,166 --> 00:11:27,625
[TOKOYAMI]
Get out!

216
00:11:28,666 --> 00:11:30,166
Aren't you dazzled?

217
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:31,375
[STUDENTS]
Shiny...

218
00:11:31,458 --> 00:11:32,375
<i>Non</i> , <i>non</i> .

219
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:34,125
It's not shiny, it's...

220
00:11:34,208 --> 00:11:35,208
Mag...

221
00:11:35,291 --> 00:11:35,958
...ni...

222
00:11:36,041 --> 00:11:36,958
...fique.

223
00:11:37,041 --> 00:11:38,125
[HAGAKURE]
Exactly what I pictured.

224
00:11:38,208 --> 00:11:40,250
Honestly, I expected more.

225
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:42,250
This is turning out
to be really fun!

226
00:11:42,333 --> 00:11:43,958
The last person
on this floor is.

227
00:11:44,041 --> 00:11:46,041
[MINETA panting]

228
00:11:46,125 --> 00:11:47,916
Hey. Come on in, girls.

229
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,416
I've got so much to show you.

230
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:51,750
[OCHACO]
So, the third floor?

231
00:11:51,833 --> 00:11:53,791
Where are you going? Come back!

232
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:58,208
[OCHACO]
Ooh... It's so bare in here!

233
00:11:58,291 --> 00:12:00,166
[HAGAKURE]
Did you move anything in at all?

234
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:02,291
[ASHIDO] Please tell me you
just haven't unpacked yet.

235
00:12:02,375 --> 00:12:05,000
Um, if we're done here,
then let's go.

236
00:12:07,041 --> 00:12:09,250
[OCHACO] Whoa! It looks
like a library in here!

237
00:12:09,333 --> 00:12:10,541
[ASHIDO]
That's the class rep for you.

238
00:12:10,625 --> 00:12:13,208
You'll find nothing odd in here.

239
00:12:13,291 --> 00:12:14,708
[OCHACO]
You have so many glasses.

240
00:12:14,791 --> 00:12:16,041
[TENYA]
Of course I do!

241
00:12:16,125 --> 00:12:18,500
I expect them all to be
destroyed during training!

242
00:12:19,666 --> 00:12:20,833
[ASHIDO, HAGAKURE, OCHACO, JIRO]
Really?

243
00:12:20,916 --> 00:12:22,791
[JIRO] This is the store
in the mall I'd avoid.

244
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:24,583
What? It's perfect!

245
00:12:26,291 --> 00:12:29,708
[OCHACO, ASHIDO]
He has a rabbit! It's so cute!

246
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:31,375
[KAMINARI]
Hey, no fair, we don't get pets.

247
00:12:31,458 --> 00:12:33,875
You're trying to buy
the judges' love!

248
00:12:33,958 --> 00:12:36,625
[IZUKU] Everyone's really
getting into the competition.

249
00:12:36,708 --> 00:12:39,750
[KAMINARI] Man, this sucks.
I feel so judged right now.

250
00:12:39,833 --> 00:12:41,625
Hey, what a coincidence.

251
00:12:41,708 --> 00:12:43,875
I don't feel great. At all.

252
00:12:43,958 --> 00:12:44,875
Same here.

253
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:46,250
<i>Et moi</i> .

254
00:12:46,333 --> 00:12:48,000
[MINETA] That's because
the boys are the only ones

255
00:12:48,083 --> 00:12:50,041
who are getting picked on.

256
00:12:50,125 --> 00:12:51,666
They said it was
a contest to see

257
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:54,416
who has the coolest dorm room.

258
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:56,083
Well, what about them?!

259
00:12:56,166 --> 00:12:59,583
We have to see the girls' rooms
to tell which one's best.

260
00:12:59,666 --> 00:13:01,375
Their interior designs
skills should be held

261
00:13:01,458 --> 00:13:03,041
at the same standard as ours.

262
00:13:03,125 --> 00:13:06,416
Maybe even higher.
Show us those dorms!

263
00:13:07,666 --> 00:13:09,416
[IZUKU] This surprisingly
convincing argument

264
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:12,583
from Mineta hit home, and
stoked our competitive spirit.

265
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:13,916
I'm into it!

266
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,416
Huh?

267
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:18,000
[IZUKU] Even the most completely
uninterested got involved.

268
00:13:18,083 --> 00:13:21,666
And that is how the very first
Class 1-A Best Room Contest

269
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:22,916
got its start!

270
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,166
[IZUKU gulps]

271
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:25,583
[IZUKU]
The girls' dorms?

272
00:13:25,666 --> 00:13:28,458
I suppose. If we must!

273
00:13:37,166 --> 00:13:38,791
[ASHIDO] Okay, so, like,
what're the rules?

274
00:13:38,875 --> 00:13:41,208
Are we figuring out who has
the best taste in the class,

275
00:13:41,291 --> 00:13:42,750
or just the overall coolest?

276
00:13:42,833 --> 00:13:44,000
We're doing this?

277
00:13:44,083 --> 00:13:46,583
This doesn't have
to be a contest.

278
00:13:47,625 --> 00:13:49,916
[MINETA] If I was the only one
asking to see the other rooms,

279
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,541
then everyone would yell at me.

280
00:13:51,625 --> 00:13:54,416
But, since all these guys with
bruised egos are on board,

281
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:57,291
I get to join in all
inconspicuous like.

282
00:13:57,375 --> 00:14:00,166
The whole class is doing it,
so why shouldn't I, right?

283
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:01,666
[MINETA cackles]

284
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:05,125
[MINETA] I'm gonna be rummaging
through the girls' rooms.

285
00:14:05,208 --> 00:14:07,958
Who knows what scintillating
secrets I'll find.

286
00:14:09,083 --> 00:14:11,291
[TODOROKI]
I'm over it.

287
00:14:11,375 --> 00:14:13,750
Let's see, who else
is on the fourth floor?

288
00:14:13,833 --> 00:14:17,166
It's Bakugo, Kirishima,
and Shoji, isn't it?

289
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:18,708
Where is Bakugo?

290
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:20,166
Uh, he thought this was lame,

291
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:22,375
so he went back
to his room to sleep.

292
00:14:22,458 --> 00:14:23,583
I could use some Zs, too.

293
00:14:23,666 --> 00:14:24,916
[HAGAKURE]
Then we'll do your room next.

294
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,333
[ASHIDO] You can sleep
all you want after.

295
00:14:27,416 --> 00:14:28,916
[KIRISHIMA]
Not that I care.

296
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,333
But you might not get
what I'm goin' for.

297
00:14:34,583 --> 00:14:36,666
A den of manliness!

298
00:14:37,541 --> 00:14:39,208
[HAGAKURE] If I found out
my boyfriend had a room

299
00:14:39,291 --> 00:14:41,166
that looked like this,
I'd dump him.

300
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:43,416
So bold! Makes me
wanna work out!

301
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:44,666
You get it.

302
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:46,166
[ASHIDO]
Next up, Shoji.

303
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:49,083
You're not gonna find
anything interesting here.

304
00:14:49,166 --> 00:14:52,166
[ASHIDO] Uh... More like
nothing at all, dude.

305
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:53,541
So, you're a minimalist, huh?

306
00:14:53,625 --> 00:14:55,416
I've just never
understood why someone

307
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,833
would wanna fill
their room with junk.

308
00:14:57,916 --> 00:15:00,833
[MINETA] Guys like this always
have a super pervy side.

309
00:15:02,083 --> 00:15:04,541
[HAGAKURE] All done! Let's
head up to the fifth floor.

310
00:15:04,625 --> 00:15:05,541
[ASHIDO]
We'll start with Sero.

311
00:15:05,625 --> 00:15:07,916
Are we seriously doing everyone?

312
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:10,833
[GIRLS]
Wow!

313
00:15:10,916 --> 00:15:11,666
Exotic!

It's lovely!

00:15:13,291 --> 00:15:14,791
Sero, I didn't peg
you for someone

316
00:15:14,875 --> 00:15:16,166
who'd like this stuff.

317
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:19,833
He, he, he. Yup, that's me,
always the wild card.

318
00:15:19,916 --> 00:15:21,125
[HAGAKURE]
Let's keep moving!

319
00:15:21,208 --> 00:15:23,541
[YAOYOROZU]
Next is Todoroki's room, right?

320
00:15:23,625 --> 00:15:26,166
[YAOYOROZU] The most capable
student in our class.

321
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:28,333
[ASHIDO]
The most handsome boy in school.

322
00:15:28,416 --> 00:15:30,958
[HAGAKURE] A chance to glance
into his quiet private life.

323
00:15:31,041 --> 00:15:32,541
How exciting!

324
00:15:32,625 --> 00:15:35,041
[TODOROKI] Let's get this
over with. It's late.

325
00:15:35,125 --> 00:15:37,500
[BOTH yell]
So Japanese!

326
00:15:37,583 --> 00:15:38,875
[KAMINARI]
It was even built differently!

327
00:15:38,958 --> 00:15:41,208
We've got these kinds of
floor mats at my home.

328
00:15:41,291 --> 00:15:43,000
They're much more
comfortable than hardwood.

329
00:15:43,083 --> 00:15:44,125
This isn't your house!

330
00:15:44,208 --> 00:15:45,833
How did you remodel
this entire room

331
00:15:45,916 --> 00:15:48,041
in just one day?

332
00:15:48,125 --> 00:15:49,416
With hard work.

333
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:50,833
[KAMINARI]
You are a beast.

334
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:52,416
[HAGAKURE]
He'll make such a good pro.

335
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,583
Pretty boys have tricks
up their sleeves.

336
00:15:54,666 --> 00:15:57,833
Okay, next! The last
of the guys is...

337
00:15:57,916 --> 00:15:59,083
Me...

338
00:16:00,875 --> 00:16:03,125
[SATO] Anyway, it's
a pretty boring room.

339
00:16:03,208 --> 00:16:05,583
[KIRISHIMA] All of them
are after Todoroki's.

340
00:16:05,666 --> 00:16:07,833
[OJIRO] Something smells good,
though. What is it?

341
00:16:07,916 --> 00:16:10,083
Oh, crap, I forgot about that!

342
00:16:10,166 --> 00:16:11,833
I finished unpacking
really early.

343
00:16:11,916 --> 00:16:13,875
So I started to bake
a chiffon cake.

344
00:16:13,958 --> 00:16:15,833
I thought we could
all eat it together.

345
00:16:15,916 --> 00:16:20,000
It hasn't been iced yet,
but, want some?

346
00:16:20,083 --> 00:16:21,166
[ASHIDO, HAGAKURE, OCHACO]
Yeah!

347
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:23,666
The strong guy's
an expert baker?!

348
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:26,375
It's delicious! So fluffy.

349
00:16:26,458 --> 00:16:27,958
[HAGAKURE]
I could eat it every day.

350
00:16:28,041 --> 00:16:30,583
Forget Sero, this is unexpected.

351
00:16:30,666 --> 00:16:32,000
[JIRO]
Mm-mm!

352
00:16:32,083 --> 00:16:34,333
I think it's great that you have
such a fun hobby, Sato.

353
00:16:34,416 --> 00:16:37,208
Would you like to bake something
to go with my tea one day?

354
00:16:37,291 --> 00:16:40,333
Uh. I seriously did
not expect this reaction.

355
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:42,208
Mostly I bake as
part of the training

356
00:16:42,291 --> 00:16:43,583
for my sugar Quirk.

357
00:16:43,666 --> 00:16:46,166
Store-bought sweets
can get pricey.

358
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:47,458
[HAGAKURE]
That's it for the boys.

359
00:16:47,541 --> 00:16:49,083
Now, it's our turn, ladies.

360
00:16:49,166 --> 00:16:50,916
[JIRO]
Aw, man, that's so many rooms.

361
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,250
Shouldn't we turn in?

362
00:16:52,333 --> 00:16:54,666
[ASHIDO]
Come on, Jiro, live a little.

363
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:56,500
[JIRO]
It's kind of embarrassing.

364
00:16:58,166 --> 00:17:00,666
Whoa, you've got
so many instruments!

365
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:02,958
[HAGAKURE] It's because
Jiro's totally punk rock.

366
00:17:03,041 --> 00:17:04,583
Can you play all these?

367
00:17:04,666 --> 00:17:06,708
Yeah. At least a little.

368
00:17:06,791 --> 00:17:08,458
Your room's girlier than this.

369
00:17:08,541 --> 00:17:10,375
Because I've got style.

370
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:12,958
We're done here.

371
00:17:13,041 --> 00:17:16,416
[HAGAKURE]
Next is me! Welcome in, guys!

372
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:17,750
What do ya think?

373
00:17:17,833 --> 00:17:19,125
[OJIRO]
A-Ah...

374
00:17:19,208 --> 00:17:22,416
[KAMINARI]
Now this is girly. So pink...

375
00:17:25,041 --> 00:17:26,208
Plus Ultra!

376
00:17:26,291 --> 00:17:28,916
[HAGAKURE] Get away from
there, Mineta, you perv!

377
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,875
We can do mine next!

378
00:17:30,958 --> 00:17:33,125
Ta-dah! Isn't it super cute?

379
00:17:33,208 --> 00:17:35,791
[STUDENTS]
Whoa...

380
00:17:35,875 --> 00:17:38,375
Yeah, it's not very
interesting, I know.

381
00:17:38,458 --> 00:17:39,916
[STUDENTS]
Wow...

382
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,416
[OJIRO]
Is this okay?

383
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:44,500
It feels dirty seeing so
many girls' rooms up close.

384
00:17:44,583 --> 00:17:46,583
This is their private space.

385
00:17:46,666 --> 00:17:48,666
[TOKOYAMI]
Forbidden gardens.

386
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:50,416
Next is Asui.

387
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:53,125
Wait, where is Tsu?
Haven't seen her.

388
00:17:53,208 --> 00:17:54,875
[OCHACO]
Oh, she wasn't feeling too good.

389
00:17:54,958 --> 00:17:56,083
So she's in her room.

390
00:17:56,166 --> 00:17:57,958
Well, we shouldn't bother her.

391
00:17:58,041 --> 00:18:00,583
She can show us later
when she's feeling better.

392
00:18:07,208 --> 00:18:09,208
[SERO] Then the last
one up is Yaoyorozu.

393
00:18:09,291 --> 00:18:10,333
The thing is...

394
00:18:10,416 --> 00:18:13,541
I... maybe miscalculated
a few things.

395
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:16,416
My room's a little bit more
cramped than I intended.

396
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,875
And maybe not as creative
as some of yours.

397
00:18:18,958 --> 00:18:20,583
That bed is huge!

398
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:22,000
You can't even walk in here!

399
00:18:22,083 --> 00:18:24,750
It's my furniture from home,
so I thought it'd fit.

400
00:18:24,833 --> 00:18:27,041
I had no idea how small
these dorm rooms

401
00:18:27,125 --> 00:18:28,666
would end up being.

402
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:30,791
[OCHACO, IZUKU]
I forget how rich she is.

403
00:18:33,291 --> 00:18:34,958
[ASHIDO]
All right, everybody.

404
00:18:35,041 --> 00:18:36,625
Has everyone got
their votes in?

405
00:18:36,708 --> 00:18:39,958
Remember, you can't
pick yourself, guys.

406
00:18:40,041 --> 00:18:42,041
And now, without further ado,

407
00:18:42,125 --> 00:18:44,875
here are the results of the
first Best Room competition,

408
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:47,541
minus Bakugo and Tsu.
Drumroll, please!

409
00:18:47,625 --> 00:18:50,916
[drumroll]

410
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,250
[ASHIDO] With a total of five
votes, the overwhelming

411
00:18:53,333 --> 00:18:57,125
winner of this totally
awesome contest is...

412
00:18:57,208 --> 00:18:59,083
Rikido Sato!

413
00:18:59,166 --> 00:19:00,416
Uh?

414
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:02,458
[ASHIDO] By the way,
all the girls voted for you.

415
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:03,333
Because...

416
00:19:03,416 --> 00:19:05,000
That cake was delicious.

417
00:19:05,083 --> 00:19:06,500
I want some more.

418
00:19:06,583 --> 00:19:07,500
[SATO]
That's why?!

419
00:19:07,583 --> 00:19:08,750
[KAMINARI, MINETA]
You villain!

420
00:19:08,833 --> 00:19:10,625
Aspiring heroes shouldn't
resort to bribery!

421
00:19:10,708 --> 00:19:11,958
[SATO]
It wasn't on purpose!

422
00:19:12,041 --> 00:19:13,458
But what the heck!

423
00:19:13,541 --> 00:19:16,083
Is it over? Can I sleep now?

424
00:19:16,166 --> 00:19:17,333
Yes, and since you had cake,

425
00:19:17,416 --> 00:19:19,375
don't forget to
brush your teeth!

426
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:21,458
Thanks for sticking it out.

427
00:19:21,541 --> 00:19:23,791
Hey! Todoroki, wait a minute.

428
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,916
Deku and Iida, you, too.

429
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,416
Yaoyorozu, Kirishima,
you have a sec?

430
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:31,375
It's really important.

431
00:19:35,875 --> 00:19:38,458
[KIRISHIMA]
So, uh. Where are we going?

432
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:44,875
[OCHACO]
Right here.

433
00:19:44,958 --> 00:19:49,041
Tsu said she had something
she wanted to tell everyone.

434
00:19:49,125 --> 00:19:51,333
[TSUYU] You guys know
I'm pretty straightforward,

435
00:19:51,416 --> 00:19:53,791
and always speak
what's on my mind.

436
00:19:53,875 --> 00:19:55,083
But sometimes...

437
00:19:55,166 --> 00:19:58,541
I don't know. I'm at a loss.

438
00:19:58,625 --> 00:20:01,000
Remember what I said
back at the hospital?

439
00:20:01,083 --> 00:20:02,916
When you were talking
about the rescue...

440
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,416
Going after Bakugo
would break the rules.

441
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:07,416
That means you'd be
acting like villains,

442
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:10,083
not heroes.

443
00:20:10,166 --> 00:20:12,708
Yeah. Every word.

444
00:20:12,791 --> 00:20:14,375
My heart was hurting.

445
00:20:14,458 --> 00:20:17,666
And the things I said
must've upset you.

446
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:19,166
It's okay, Tsu.

447
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:20,541
Despite my warning,

448
00:20:20,625 --> 00:20:22,791
you still went and saved Bakugo.

449
00:20:22,875 --> 00:20:25,625
I didn't know that
until this morning.

450
00:20:25,708 --> 00:20:27,583
I thought I'd stopped you.

451
00:20:27,666 --> 00:20:29,750
But it turns out
I was worthless.

452
00:20:29,833 --> 00:20:31,333
A complete failure.

453
00:20:31,416 --> 00:20:34,208
And suddenly I had
no idea what to say.

454
00:20:34,291 --> 00:20:36,833
I didn't think I deserved
to joke around and have fun

455
00:20:36,916 --> 00:20:39,750
with everyone like usual.

456
00:20:39,833 --> 00:20:41,875
But...

457
00:20:41,958 --> 00:20:45,708
It made me... so sad
to be without you.

458
00:20:47,708 --> 00:20:49,750
[TSUYU] That's why I
wanted to talk to you.

459
00:20:49,833 --> 00:20:53,083
Even if I'm still not sure
how I'm supposed to be feeling.

460
00:20:53,166 --> 00:20:55,291
I wanted you to know
so we can hang out and talk

461
00:20:55,375 --> 00:20:57,541
and have a good time again.

462
00:20:59,916 --> 00:21:01,875
It's not just you
who thinks that.

463
00:21:01,958 --> 00:21:03,916
Everyone... felt
pretty bad and...

464
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,708
...wanted things back the
way they used to be before.

465
00:21:06,791 --> 00:21:08,708
That's why we did
the room contest.

466
00:21:08,791 --> 00:21:10,166
To bring us closer together

467
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:12,375
and make us feel
like a class again.

468
00:21:12,458 --> 00:21:15,291
It's all we could come up with,
so please don't think

469
00:21:15,375 --> 00:21:18,208
we were trying to
trick you or anything.

470
00:21:18,291 --> 00:21:19,916
Look, what I'm saying is,

471
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,458
let's all work hard
at our training

472
00:21:21,541 --> 00:21:23,666
and be good friends again, okay?

473
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:25,541
[KIRISHIMA]
Tsu!

474
00:21:25,625 --> 00:21:26,541
I'm sorry!

475
00:21:26,625 --> 00:21:28,041
Thanks for telling
us how you feel!

476
00:21:28,125 --> 00:21:28,916
It's okay.

477
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,333
I apologize.

478
00:21:30,416 --> 00:21:31,458
[TODOROKI]
You shouldn't feel bad.

479
00:21:31,541 --> 00:21:33,625
[IZUKU]
Asu-- Tsu!

480
00:21:33,708 --> 00:21:35,541
Listen. I won't
make you sad again!

481
00:21:35,625 --> 00:21:36,375
[YAOYOROZU]
Me either.

482
00:21:36,458 --> 00:21:38,291
We promise!

483
00:21:39,791 --> 00:21:41,083
[IZUKU]
That's right.

484
00:21:41,166 --> 00:21:43,666
Everyone wants things
to go back to normal.

485
00:21:44,875 --> 00:21:47,375
[IZUKU] We need our
lives to feel stable.

486
00:21:47,458 --> 00:21:51,708
Even though so much has changed
and will keep changing.

487
00:21:51,791 --> 00:21:54,500
It's our duty to make
each other better, stronger,

488
00:21:54,583 --> 00:21:57,041
so we can become
heroes together.

489
00:23:29,125 --> 00:23:30,541
[IZUKU]
Here's the preview!

490
00:23:30,625 --> 00:23:32,958
Settling into dorm life
will be an adjustment, sure,

491
00:23:33,041 --> 00:23:34,666
but that's not all we're facing.

492
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:35,916
There's a long road ahead of us

493
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,500
if we're going to develop
our Quirks further

494
00:23:37,583 --> 00:23:39,916
and get comfortable with
our fighting styles.

495
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,416
Plus, to prep for the exam,

496
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:43,541
we need to come up
with ultimate moves.

497
00:23:43,625 --> 00:23:45,791
The problem is, I can't
overuse One For All

498
00:23:45,875 --> 00:23:47,333
or I'll hurt my body.

499
00:23:47,416 --> 00:23:49,041
How am I supposed to come
up with a new attack

500
00:23:49,125 --> 00:23:50,875
when my arms are so messed up?

501
00:23:50,958 --> 00:23:53,541
Next time: "Create Those
Ultimate Moves"!

502
00:23:53,625 --> 00:23:56,083
Changing the way you think
can be the key to victory!

503
00:23:56,166 --> 00:23:58,458
Go beyond! Plus Ultra!
