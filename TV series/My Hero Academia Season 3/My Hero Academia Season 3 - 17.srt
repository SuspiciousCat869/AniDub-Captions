00:00:10,375 --> 00:00:13,000
[IZUKU] Welcome to UA High,
the prestigious school

2
00:00:13,083 --> 00:00:16,125
that's turned out some of
the world's greatest heroes.

3
00:00:16,208 --> 00:00:18,250
I'm running toward my
dream in these halls.

4
00:00:18,333 --> 00:00:20,375
Learning to overcome
obstacles and save people

5
00:00:20,458 --> 00:00:22,875
with a smile on my face.

6
00:00:22,958 --> 00:00:25,791
That's how I'll become the
greatest hero in the world!

7
00:02:01,625 --> 00:02:04,875
[SEIJIN STUDENT 54A]
Don't be cocky! We're prepared!

8
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:07,416
[TODOROKI] Looks like a Quirk
that makes things bigger.

9
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,333
[SEIJIN STUDENT 54A] That's
not all I brought with me!

10
00:02:18,541 --> 00:02:20,000
[TODOROKI]
Even if I couldn't melt it,

11
00:02:20,083 --> 00:02:22,125
I should have at
least made a mark!

12
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,750
[SEIJIN STUDENT 54A]
Your fire won't work against

13
00:02:25,833 --> 00:02:27,208
any of my tools.

14
00:02:27,291 --> 00:02:30,083
Tungsten has a super
high melting point!

15
00:02:33,083 --> 00:02:36,166
[SEIJIN STUDENT 54A] I'm afraid
I told you so, Todoroki.

16
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:38,208
Even if you're a top UA student,

17
00:02:38,291 --> 00:02:41,166
if you think can pass
this exam alone...

18
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:42,291
Well, then...

19
00:02:42,375 --> 00:02:44,666
Your pride will
be your downfall.

20
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:46,083
You fools.

21
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:46,958
[SEIJIN STUDENT 54A]
Do it!

22
00:02:47,041 --> 00:02:48,000
[SEIJIN STUDENTS]
Right!

23
00:02:53,333 --> 00:02:55,125
[SEIJIN STUDENT 54A]
Keep attacking. Don't let up!

24
00:02:55,208 --> 00:02:56,166
[SEIJIN STUDENT 55A]
Got it!

25
00:03:00,041 --> 00:03:03,625
[TODOROKI] Water for my flames
and physical attacks for my ice.

26
00:03:03,708 --> 00:03:06,500
They've worked out a way
to counter everything I have.

27
00:03:08,375 --> 00:03:10,458
[SEIJIN STUDENT 54AA]
It's useless to resist!

28
00:03:14,708 --> 00:03:16,583
[SEIJIN STUDENT 54A]
Where'd he go?

29
00:03:16,666 --> 00:03:18,208
[TODOROKI] The Heroes
Public Safety Commission

30
00:03:18,291 --> 00:03:19,625
must have constructed
this factory

31
00:03:19,708 --> 00:03:22,291
to be as realistic as possible.

32
00:03:22,375 --> 00:03:24,166
No wonder they told us
to choose a terrain

33
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:26,291
that would suit our style.

34
00:03:26,375 --> 00:03:28,041
[SEIJIN STUDENT 54A]
There he is. Surround him!

35
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:30,833
[TODOROKI] In that case,
I'm guessing that this tank

36
00:03:30,916 --> 00:03:32,666
is full of the real thing.

37
00:03:33,958 --> 00:03:35,125
[SEIJIN STUDENT 54A gasps]

38
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:38,708
[SEIJIN STUDENT 54A]
He got us.

39
00:03:45,958 --> 00:03:48,250
[SEIJIN STUDENTS scream]

40
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:54,166
[SEIJIN STUDENT 54A]
To pull such a move. He's crazy!

41
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,125
[TODOROKI] Well, it looks
like the commission

42
00:03:58,208 --> 00:04:01,375
kept the force of the explosion
from being too damaging.

43
00:04:01,458 --> 00:04:02,708
[SEIJIN STUDENT 54A]
You bastard.

44
00:04:02,791 --> 00:04:06,875
Apologies. But I simply
cannot afford to fail.

45
00:04:12,583 --> 00:04:15,041
[TODOROKI] If I could only use
both sides at the same time.

46
00:04:15,125 --> 00:04:18,041
Switching slows me down.
I need to practice more.

47
00:04:18,125 --> 00:04:19,375
[beeping]

48
00:04:19,458 --> 00:04:20,875
[TARGET] Students who have
passed the exam should

49
00:04:20,958 --> 00:04:23,791
congregate in the
anteroom. Chop, chop.

50
00:04:23,875 --> 00:04:25,333
[PRESENT MIC] These high-tech
targets keep track

51
00:04:25,416 --> 00:04:27,958
of who passes and fails.
With so many examinees,

52
00:04:28,041 --> 00:04:29,750
it's the only way
that makes sense.

53
00:04:29,833 --> 00:04:31,125
The targets can also determine

54
00:04:31,208 --> 00:04:33,416
who is responsible each
time one of them is hit,

55
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:35,333
based on a student's
location, movements,

56
00:04:35,416 --> 00:04:37,541
and various other
factors being recorded!

57
00:04:37,625 --> 00:04:39,708
Oh, and, once mounted,
they can only

58
00:04:39,791 --> 00:04:42,125
be removed with a
special magnetic key.

59
00:04:42,208 --> 00:04:44,041
It's all very fancy!

60
00:04:47,916 --> 00:04:50,791
[SEIAI STUDENT 55AA] Miss Sai?
We'll soon have company.

61
00:04:50,875 --> 00:04:54,166
I've confirmed four UA students
have entered the building.

62
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:55,875
[INTELLI]
Let's have a look at the video.

63
00:04:55,958 --> 00:04:57,041
Certainly.

64
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:01,791
[INTELLI] Arm duplication.
A sound-wave manipulator.

65
00:05:01,875 --> 00:05:05,833
The frog. And a Quirk that
allows you to make things.

66
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,875
It seems that our prey
has been decided.

67
00:05:15,958 --> 00:05:18,000
Please gather the other ladies.

68
00:05:18,083 --> 00:05:20,333
Yes, Miss Sai.

69
00:05:20,416 --> 00:05:22,916
[INTELLI] The formula for
my success is flawless.

70
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,250
What an excellent
day for an exam.

71
00:05:25,333 --> 00:05:27,625
[INTELLI laughs]

72
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,250
[TODOROKI]
So they've all passed?

73
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:36,000
[YOARASHI] Seriously?
I'm a huge fan of Stampman!

74
00:05:36,083 --> 00:05:38,000
I love a hero who's
super passionate!

75
00:05:38,083 --> 00:05:40,083
[STUDENT 55A]
Who is this guy?

76
00:05:40,166 --> 00:05:41,500
[TODOROKI] If he applied
through recommendations,

77
00:05:41,583 --> 00:05:43,500
I should've seen him
at the entrance exam.

78
00:05:43,583 --> 00:05:45,166
I wanna be like...

79
00:05:49,333 --> 00:05:50,708
Wait, what were
we talkin' about?

80
00:05:50,791 --> 00:05:51,750
[STUDENT 55A]
I dunno...

81
00:05:51,833 --> 00:05:53,875
You just came up
and started talking!

82
00:05:55,958 --> 00:05:58,500
[MERA]
So far, 56 people have passed.

83
00:05:58,583 --> 00:06:01,875
Don't panic, but do consider
that your time is almost up.

84
00:06:01,958 --> 00:06:03,875
Good luck.

85
00:06:03,958 --> 00:06:05,958
[TSUYU]
Having any luck, Shoji?

86
00:06:06,041 --> 00:06:09,250
[SHOJI] It's no use. I can't
see anyone from our class.

87
00:06:09,333 --> 00:06:11,541
[TSUYU]
Maybe they're in another area.

88
00:06:11,625 --> 00:06:13,083
[SHOJI]
Most likely.

89
00:06:13,166 --> 00:06:15,333
Yaoyorozu. You heard that right?

90
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:17,333
Less than half of
the spots remain.

91
00:06:17,416 --> 00:06:19,958
We should probably give up
on finding everyone.

92
00:06:20,041 --> 00:06:23,250
We need to fight for ourselves
and make sure we pass.

93
00:06:23,333 --> 00:06:25,708
Yes. That would be wisest.

94
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:27,250
[JIRO]
Shh!

95
00:06:27,333 --> 00:06:29,083
I hear four people
climbing the stairs.

96
00:06:29,166 --> 00:06:31,750
Ten floors below.

97
00:06:31,833 --> 00:06:33,375
They're headed up here.

98
00:06:33,458 --> 00:06:35,083
[SHOJI]
Are they planning to attack us?

99
00:06:35,166 --> 00:06:36,708
[YAOYOROZU] I don't understand
why there are only

100
00:06:36,791 --> 00:06:39,250
four of them coming
if that's the case.

101
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:41,125
All the other schools
we've observed have moved

102
00:06:41,208 --> 00:06:43,250
in much larger groups than that.

103
00:06:43,333 --> 00:06:45,208
Maybe their companions
were defeated

104
00:06:45,291 --> 00:06:47,541
and they're running
away to hide in here.

105
00:06:47,625 --> 00:06:49,875
[JIRO] No. That's not
what this sounds like.

106
00:06:49,958 --> 00:06:52,125
They're not stopping
on the other floors.

107
00:06:52,208 --> 00:06:54,916
Are there more of them
hiding somewhere?

108
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,500
[YAOYOROZU] Is this a
distraction? Or worse.

109
00:06:57,583 --> 00:06:58,625
[guitar strums]

110
00:06:58,708 --> 00:07:01,458
[screams]

111
00:07:01,541 --> 00:07:02,958
--[YAOYOROZU] Jiro!
--[TSUYU] Are you okay?

112
00:07:04,416 --> 00:07:07,500
[SHOJI] There's music playing!
It's not too bad for me.

113
00:07:07,583 --> 00:07:10,250
But hearing it suddenly must've
been a huge shock for Jiro.

114
00:07:10,333 --> 00:07:11,750
So they must know Kyoka's Quirk

115
00:07:11,833 --> 00:07:14,041
and were targeting
her on purpose.

116
00:07:14,125 --> 00:07:17,333
[SHOJI]
It's a coordinated attack.

117
00:07:17,416 --> 00:07:19,083
[YAOYOROZU]
This isn't good.

118
00:07:19,166 --> 00:07:21,208
Now we can't tell
where anyone is.

119
00:07:21,291 --> 00:07:23,291
Phase one's officially complete.

120
00:07:23,375 --> 00:07:26,833
Let's begin phase two. Shouldn't
keep our guests waiting.

121
00:07:28,958 --> 00:07:30,083
Everyone hide!

122
00:07:30,166 --> 00:07:31,583
Attacks from the outside?

123
00:07:31,666 --> 00:07:33,708
What's their plan?

124
00:07:33,791 --> 00:07:36,208
[SHOJI] They're trying to keep
me from using my eyes.

125
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,750
[YAOYOROZU] The first thing
they did was counteract Jiro

126
00:07:39,833 --> 00:07:42,250
and Shoji's Quirks,
which are perfectly suited

127
00:07:42,333 --> 00:07:44,791
for detecting enemy locations.

128
00:07:44,875 --> 00:07:47,125
Our opponents know
exactly who we are.

129
00:07:47,208 --> 00:07:49,208
And more importantly,
what we can do.

130
00:07:49,291 --> 00:07:52,458
[SHOJI] Yaoyorozu. What
could their next move be?

131
00:07:52,541 --> 00:07:53,875
[YAOYOROZU]
I'm not positive.

132
00:07:53,958 --> 00:07:56,291
But it seems likely that
they're trying to trap us here.

133
00:07:56,375 --> 00:07:57,541
And then they'll surround us

134
00:07:57,625 --> 00:07:59,666
and move in to
attack as a group.

135
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:02,041
[YAOYOROZU] Yes. We should
assume they're already

136
00:08:02,125 --> 00:08:05,250
close by, waiting for the
right moment to strike.

137
00:08:05,333 --> 00:08:06,708
In that case, we have to fight!

138
00:08:06,791 --> 00:08:07,791
Wait, don't be reckless!

139
00:08:07,875 --> 00:08:08,958
Heartbeat Dist--!

140
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:14,541
Phase two is complete, ma'am.

141
00:08:14,625 --> 00:08:15,333
[SHOJI]
Jiro!

142
00:08:15,416 --> 00:08:16,666
Are you injured?

143
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:19,958
[JIRO] They got my amp.
And my left ear!

144
00:08:21,166 --> 00:08:23,416
[YAOYOROZU]
They knew what she'd do?

145
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,000
If they were able
to predict our actions

146
00:08:25,083 --> 00:08:27,208
so accurately after
seeing only one attack

147
00:08:27,291 --> 00:08:28,958
in the beginning of the exam,

148
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:31,541
then their plan is
well thought out.

149
00:08:31,625 --> 00:08:33,458
There must be someone
extremely intelligent

150
00:08:33,541 --> 00:08:36,375
among our opponents. A student
with an eye for strategy.

151
00:08:36,458 --> 00:08:38,708
[SHOJI]
Does it feel colder to you?

152
00:08:38,791 --> 00:08:41,833
Actually, now that
you mention it, yes.

153
00:08:41,916 --> 00:08:44,541
[gasps] It's coming
from the vents!

154
00:08:46,041 --> 00:08:47,916
[SEIAI STUDENT 55CC]
Phase three is underway.

155
00:08:51,333 --> 00:08:52,875
[SHOJI]
They've shut us in?

156
00:08:55,208 --> 00:08:57,375
The temperature is
steadily decreasing.

157
00:08:57,458 --> 00:08:59,625
This place is turning
into a freezer!

158
00:08:59,708 --> 00:09:01,083
Ri... Ribbit...

159
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:03,208
[SHOJI]
Asui! What's wrong?

160
00:09:03,291 --> 00:09:04,458
--[YAOYOROZU gasps]
--[JIRO] Oh, crap.

161
00:09:04,541 --> 00:09:06,208
Since the temperature
dropped all of a sudden,

162
00:09:06,291 --> 00:09:08,500
her body's going
into hibernation!

163
00:09:08,583 --> 00:09:10,291
Ribbit...

164
00:09:10,375 --> 00:09:12,750
[SHOJI] We need fire!
Make a lighter or matches!

165
00:09:12,833 --> 00:09:15,583
No, I can't. We'll set
the sprinklers off.

166
00:09:15,666 --> 00:09:18,083
That's only going to
make her even colder.

167
00:09:18,166 --> 00:09:19,708
An electric heater or something?

168
00:09:19,791 --> 00:09:22,250
Our opponents have control
over the air conditioner.

169
00:09:22,333 --> 00:09:25,666
They've probably turned off
the electricity as well.

170
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:27,125
Here's a blanket for now.

171
00:09:27,208 --> 00:09:28,166
[SHOJI]
All right.

172
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,708
What're they doing to the door?

173
00:09:31,791 --> 00:09:34,291
[YAOYOROZU] Welding it shut.
Trapping us further.

174
00:09:35,833 --> 00:09:37,583
[SHOJI] Are they trying
to freeze us solid?

175
00:09:37,666 --> 00:09:40,125
[JIRO] Those doors over there're
the only ones we have left.

176
00:09:40,208 --> 00:09:41,875
[SHOJI]
We could break through.

177
00:09:41,958 --> 00:09:43,166
[YAOYOROZU]
Our opponents are definitely

178
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:46,041
waiting on the other side.
It's dangerous.

179
00:09:46,125 --> 00:09:48,333
[SHOJI] How did they manage
to outthink us so quickly?

180
00:09:48,416 --> 00:09:50,708
What are we supposed to do?

181
00:09:50,791 --> 00:09:52,708
[SHOJI] If we stay
holed up in this room,

182
00:09:52,791 --> 00:09:54,666
we'll have to do
something about the cold.

183
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:56,583
Otherwise we'll be done for.

184
00:09:56,666 --> 00:09:59,041
Yao-momo. What if
you made a bomb?

185
00:09:59,125 --> 00:10:01,041
We could blow the door
to the emergency exit.

186
00:10:01,125 --> 00:10:04,125
We'd run the risk of causing
a phreatic explosion.

187
00:10:04,208 --> 00:10:06,166
And they likely knew
we'd think about that.

188
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:08,083
Which is why the sealed
the observation room

189
00:10:08,166 --> 00:10:09,208
and lowered the temperature.

190
00:10:09,291 --> 00:10:10,833
Then what?

191
00:10:10,916 --> 00:10:13,416
[YAOYOROZU]
Think, Momo. You have to.

192
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:16,000
Figure out a solution
to this situation.

193
00:10:16,083 --> 00:10:17,833
With one ear injured,
Jiro can't use

194
00:10:17,916 --> 00:10:20,916
her sound attacks to
their fullest capacity.

195
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,750
So what? Should we smash
the wall to escape?

196
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:27,208
No. That's a simple move,
and our enemies

197
00:10:27,291 --> 00:10:29,625
will have expected
something so obvious.

198
00:10:29,708 --> 00:10:31,000
For now,

199
00:10:31,083 --> 00:10:33,333
we need to do something
about the air conditioning.

200
00:10:33,416 --> 00:10:36,416
I could make some clay
to seal off the vents.

201
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:38,916
It looks like there are
eight of them in the room.

202
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,625
That will end up using
a lot of my Quirk,

203
00:10:40,708 --> 00:10:44,458
but right now...
it's all I can do.

204
00:10:44,541 --> 00:10:45,541
[SEIAI STUDENT 55DD]
Miss Sai.

205
00:10:45,625 --> 00:10:48,000
Phase three has been completed.

206
00:10:48,083 --> 00:10:50,791
Lovely. Now we just
give them time.

207
00:10:50,875 --> 00:10:52,208
[SEIAI STUDENT 55AA]
Yes, ma'am.

208
00:10:52,291 --> 00:10:54,458
[INTELLI] The biggest problem
facing these UA students

209
00:10:54,541 --> 00:10:56,958
is the frigid air being
pumped into the room.

210
00:10:57,041 --> 00:10:59,375
In order to fix that,
the one named Yaoyorozu

211
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:01,958
must utilize her power.

212
00:11:02,041 --> 00:11:04,375
Her Quirk uses the
lipids inside her body

213
00:11:04,458 --> 00:11:06,041
to create solid matter.

214
00:11:06,125 --> 00:11:08,041
In other words,
there's a finite limit

215
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:11,000
to how much she can create.

216
00:11:11,083 --> 00:11:13,125
We'll make her
exhaust her abilities.

217
00:11:13,208 --> 00:11:16,375
Then all four of their Quirks
will be rendered quite useless.

218
00:11:16,458 --> 00:11:18,541
This is my strategic design.

219
00:11:18,625 --> 00:11:20,791
My equation for success.

220
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:25,750
[PRESENT MIC] Seiai Academy.
Saiko Intelli, Second Year.

221
00:11:25,833 --> 00:11:27,375
Her Quirk: IQ.

222
00:11:27,458 --> 00:11:29,458
After she drinks tea
and closes her eyes,

223
00:11:29,541 --> 00:11:31,458
her IQ multiplies.

224
00:11:31,541 --> 00:11:33,750
It's already 150 to begin with,

225
00:11:33,833 --> 00:11:37,333
so after a few sips,
she becomes a real genius!

226
00:11:37,416 --> 00:11:39,041
By the way, different
brands of tea

227
00:11:39,125 --> 00:11:41,041
have different effects
on her Quirk!

228
00:11:41,125 --> 00:11:42,583
[INTELLI laughs]

229
00:11:42,666 --> 00:11:44,541
[SEIAI STUDENTS]
Ah!

230
00:11:44,625 --> 00:11:48,500
Now. Use your Quirk, Yaoyorozu.

231
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:50,291
It will be the
beginning of the end

232
00:11:50,375 --> 00:11:52,375
for you and your friends.

233
00:11:53,375 --> 00:11:55,333
[INTELLI giggles]

234
00:11:55,416 --> 00:11:58,166
[INTELLI]
Now. Use your Quirk, Yaoyorozu.

235
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:02,833
It will be the beginning of the
end for you and your friends.

236
00:12:02,916 --> 00:12:04,875
Hey, why aren't you
making anything?

237
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:06,958
[SHOJI]
Is there something wrong?

238
00:12:07,041 --> 00:12:10,250
No matter how many different
ways I look at this situation,

239
00:12:10,333 --> 00:12:11,666
I get the same answer.

240
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:14,083
The enemies want me
to use my Quirk.

241
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:16,500
[SHOJI] Until you can't
create anything else.

242
00:12:16,583 --> 00:12:19,458
[YAOYOROZU] Right. My Quirk
has many applications.

243
00:12:19,541 --> 00:12:22,083
They can't account for all
the things that I might make.

244
00:12:22,166 --> 00:12:24,166
Which is why they're doing this.

245
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:25,666
At first, I thought
the manipulation

246
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:28,625
of the air conditioning was
to take Asui off the board.

247
00:12:28,708 --> 00:12:31,041
But I believe their true
intention was to force my hand

248
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:33,208
and exhaust me.

249
00:12:33,291 --> 00:12:34,583
[SHOJI]
Very clever.

250
00:12:34,666 --> 00:12:36,625
And once you're powerless,
they'll march in.

251
00:12:36,708 --> 00:12:38,833
No doubt they could
easily hit our targets.

252
00:12:38,916 --> 00:12:41,083
Yes. So I can't use it.

253
00:12:41,166 --> 00:12:43,041
We'd just be playing
right into their hands.

254
00:12:43,125 --> 00:12:46,708
We wait for the need to arise,
when there's no other option.

255
00:12:46,791 --> 00:12:49,083
[JIRO] But if we stay hiding
in here, there's no possible

256
00:12:49,166 --> 00:12:51,041
way we'll pass
the licensing exam!

257
00:12:51,125 --> 00:12:54,000
We should just charge out that
door and attack them head on.

258
00:12:54,083 --> 00:12:56,000
[SHOJI] I'm sure that such
a smart enemy has predicted

259
00:12:56,083 --> 00:12:57,208
that we might do that.

260
00:12:57,291 --> 00:12:59,500
Okay, fine, then what do we do?

261
00:12:59,583 --> 00:13:01,041
[YAOYOROZU]
Come on, think!

262
00:13:01,125 --> 00:13:03,541
How would Todoroki act
in a time like this?

263
00:13:03,625 --> 00:13:06,125
Or Iida. Or Midoriya?

264
00:13:06,208 --> 00:13:07,666
[IZUKU]
I know I'm hurt.

265
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:12,041
But if I can still move at all,
then I can't just sit still.

266
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:15,875
I have to reach out
and do something.

267
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:19,000
'Cause all I can think
about is saving him.

269
00:13:20,666 --> 00:13:23,375
[YAOYOROZU] That's right.
I have to save them.

270
00:13:23,458 --> 00:13:26,750
Shoji, Jiro, and Asui!

271
00:13:26,833 --> 00:13:28,708
Forget about my
provisional exam.

272
00:13:28,791 --> 00:13:32,333
Focus on these three.
That's what really matters.

273
00:13:34,291 --> 00:13:35,625
[YAOYOROZU]
In order to do that...

274
00:13:35,708 --> 00:13:39,000
In order to get my
friends out of here...

[YAOYOROZU]
Just bear with me!

280
00:13:47,125 --> 00:13:49,375

Huh? Why headphones?

00:13:49,458 --> 00:13:51,125
[YAOYOROZU]
Please, put them on.

282

[YAOYOROZU] It's the first time
I've made this device,

283
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:56,708
but its structure isn't
all the complicated.

284
00:13:56,791 --> 00:13:59,791
I'll just save enough lipids
so I can still move.

285
00:13:59,875 --> 00:14:02,291
And make it as big as possible.

00:15:03,333 --> 00:15:06,583
Yeah. Ribbit. I'll be okay.

311
00:15:06,666 --> 00:15:08,375
Oh, thank goodness.

312
00:15:10,125 --> 00:15:11,458
[YAOYOROZU yelps]

313
00:15:11,541 --> 00:15:12,541
[JIRO]
No!

314
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:18,625
[INTELLI] You used your Quirk
to attack not defend.

315
00:15:18,708 --> 00:15:20,375
It was a high-risk move.

316
00:15:20,458 --> 00:15:24,208
I can't believe a UA student
would choose such a method.

317
00:15:24,291 --> 00:15:27,458
But because of that, you
can't fight now, can you?

318
00:15:27,541 --> 00:15:28,708
I may not pass,

319
00:15:28,791 --> 00:15:30,875
but I'll make sure
you don't either.

320
00:15:31,916 --> 00:15:33,666
[YAOYOROZU]
I can't give up now.

321
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:35,458
Think of all the intensive
training we've done

322
00:15:35,541 --> 00:15:37,083
at camp and school.

323
00:15:37,166 --> 00:15:39,500
It's time to show off
those results.

324
00:15:41,416 --> 00:15:43,791
[INTELLI growls]
You're struggling in vain!

325
00:15:44,958 --> 00:15:46,708
[TSUYU]
Ribbit!

326
00:15:46,791 --> 00:15:48,125
[INTELLI gasps]

327
00:15:48,208 --> 00:15:49,041
You guys!

328
00:15:49,125 --> 00:15:50,833
But, why did you come back?

329
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:52,625
Surely you assumed
that I'd already hit

330
00:15:52,708 --> 00:15:54,416
all three of her triggers?

331
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:56,750
We're in the middle
of the licensing exam.

332
00:15:56,833 --> 00:15:58,333
You should be thinking
of yourselves,

333
00:15:58,416 --> 00:16:00,125
not your other classmates.

334
00:16:00,208 --> 00:16:02,458
That might be how
you roll, but not us.

335
00:16:02,541 --> 00:16:04,083
We're obviously different.

336
00:16:04,166 --> 00:16:05,250
She's our friend.

337
00:16:05,333 --> 00:16:07,625
Which means we'd never
leave her behind.

338
00:16:07,708 --> 00:16:09,958
[SHOJI]
And we don't give up.

339
00:16:10,041 --> 00:16:12,083
[IZUKU] I don't want to
choose one or the other.

340
00:16:12,166 --> 00:16:14,916
I'm going to save both of them!

341
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,666
[SHOJI]
It's just like Midoriya said.

342
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:19,791
[YAOYOROZU]
It's how Class 1-A is.

343
00:16:19,875 --> 00:16:21,750
We look out for each other.

344
00:16:26,833 --> 00:16:29,208
You've defeated me completely.

345
00:16:29,291 --> 00:16:31,333
UA doesn't disappoint.

346
00:16:34,375 --> 00:16:37,000
[KIRISHIMA] Hey, Kaminari.
Why'd you follow us?

347
00:16:37,083 --> 00:16:39,250
[KAMINARI] I dunno. 'Cause
you guys started running.

348
00:16:39,333 --> 00:16:42,291
I didn't wanna end up alone.
Where're we going?

349
00:16:42,375 --> 00:16:43,333
Shut up!

350
00:16:43,416 --> 00:16:44,625
Why you always gotta
sound so mad?

351
00:16:44,708 --> 00:16:46,833
I told you to chill out, Bakugo.

352
00:16:46,916 --> 00:16:48,250
Looks like there's a lot
of people up there,

353
00:16:48,333 --> 00:16:50,166
so the three of us
should work together.

354
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:51,041
[KATSUKI]
Go die.

355
00:16:51,125 --> 00:16:53,208
[KIRISHIMA]
Come on, man.

356
00:16:53,291 --> 00:16:55,000
Look out!

357
00:16:55,083 --> 00:16:55,750
Kirishima!

358
00:16:55,833 --> 00:16:57,208
[KIRISHIMA]
Damn it!

359
00:16:57,291 --> 00:16:59,166
What's going on?

360
00:17:01,166 --> 00:17:03,958
[KAMINARI] What the crap?
Did that really just happen?

361
00:17:04,041 --> 00:17:05,083
[KATSUKI]
All I know is

362
00:17:05,166 --> 00:17:08,666
that bastard looks
like he's to blame.

363
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:10,916
So I'll kill him.

364
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,916
[MERA]
More examinees have passed.

365
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,750
We're at 60 people now.

366
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:17,791
That means there
are 40 spots left.

367
00:17:17,875 --> 00:17:19,125
[SERO]
We're running out of time.

368
00:17:19,208 --> 00:17:20,833
This is bad. What do we do?

369
00:17:20,916 --> 00:17:24,083
[IZUKU] Yeah. I knew we'd be
in trouble if we got split.

370
00:17:24,166 --> 00:17:26,250
But at least we can probably
do something about the group

371
00:17:26,333 --> 00:17:29,083
that's near us, and maybe
even make a few points.

372
00:17:29,166 --> 00:17:32,166
[SERO]
Really? What are you thinkin'?

373
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:35,083
[IZUKU] Earlier, someone tried
to outpace his classmates.

374
00:17:35,166 --> 00:17:36,500
[SHIKETSU BOY 54B]
I'll take her down fast.

375
00:17:36,583 --> 00:17:37,958
[SHIKETSU BOY 54C]
No, wait!

376
00:17:38,041 --> 00:17:40,333
He was panicking that he
wouldn't get enough points in.

377
00:17:40,416 --> 00:17:42,500
Since his class
attacked as a group,

378
00:17:42,583 --> 00:17:45,250
they'd definitely end up
fighting over their targets.

379
00:17:45,333 --> 00:17:47,125
Oh, so, as people
get worried,

380
00:17:47,208 --> 00:17:48,625
they'll break away from
their classmates,

381
00:17:48,708 --> 00:17:51,250
and then they'll be
at a big disadvantage.

382
00:17:51,333 --> 00:17:52,458
[SERO]
Wait. Then why were you saying

383
00:17:52,541 --> 00:17:53,708
we should all stick together?

384
00:17:53,791 --> 00:17:55,083
We'd be in the same boat.

385
00:17:55,166 --> 00:17:57,375
Well, to begin with, we were
told to hit weak points

386
00:17:57,458 --> 00:17:58,875
with balls, so it's
easy to think of this

387
00:17:58,958 --> 00:18:00,291
as target practice.

388
00:18:00,375 --> 00:18:01,791
And without knowing
our opponents' Quirks,

389
00:18:01,875 --> 00:18:03,625
we're basically going in blind.

390
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:06,208
But it's not easy or efficient
to go after moving targets,

391
00:18:06,291 --> 00:18:07,291
'cause, after all,

392
00:18:07,375 --> 00:18:09,875
they'll be protected.
Think about it.

393
00:18:09,958 --> 00:18:11,416
I wanted to first make
sure that we trapped

394
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:14,000
enough people for everyone
in our class to pass.

395
00:18:14,083 --> 00:18:15,541
Then we'd use our
balls only after

396
00:18:15,625 --> 00:18:17,458
they couldn't move anymore.

397
00:18:17,541 --> 00:18:19,083
Our class has a lot
of people who excel

398
00:18:19,166 --> 00:18:20,416
in restraining groups.

399
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,833
So I kinda thought it
wouldn't be any trouble.

400
00:18:22,916 --> 00:18:24,291
[SERO]
I see.

401
00:18:24,375 --> 00:18:26,291
It's true that if we were
just doing target practice,

402
00:18:26,375 --> 00:18:27,875
they'd only be able
to tell whether or not

403
00:18:27,958 --> 00:18:29,375
we were good shots.

404
00:18:29,458 --> 00:18:32,125
There's more to this test
than I originally realized.

405
00:18:32,208 --> 00:18:35,250
Shh! Listen, you guys.

406
00:18:35,333 --> 00:18:38,041
Does it sound like
they're getting closer?

407
00:18:38,125 --> 00:18:40,000
[SERO]
What should we do?

408
00:18:40,083 --> 00:18:41,000
I'll go after them.

409
00:18:41,083 --> 00:18:41,916
[SERO]
Huh?!

410
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,583
I'll be a decoy
so you can move.

411
00:18:43,666 --> 00:18:45,250
Be on the lookout for
openings that'll let you

412
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:47,500
immobilize people
to get some points.

413
00:18:47,583 --> 00:18:49,833
Your Quirks are better
at that than mine.

414
00:18:49,916 --> 00:18:51,750
I'm more of a fighter.

415
00:18:51,833 --> 00:18:54,708
[SERO] A decoy.
There's three of us, so,

416
00:18:54,791 --> 00:18:57,416
we'd need six people.

Okay, fine!

[OCHACO]
I trust Deku.

422
00:19:07,125 --> 00:19:10,166
He's pulled through enough
times that I believe in him.

423
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:12,208
Now. Move.

[SHISHIKURA]
I'm from Shiketsu.

Please notice, my school

when we're working.

427
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:23,083
Why's that? Because...

428
00:19:23,166 --> 00:19:25,166
Each and every one
of our movements

429
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:28,666
is crowned by the legacy
and honor of our school.

430
00:19:30,458 --> 00:19:32,416
This is a demonstration.

431

Proof of the difference
in level between

sorely lacking among you.

Makes me feel kind of dumb.

438

[KATSUKI] He said his beady
eyes are full of tears,

439
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,583
so he can't see how
strong his opponents are.

00:20:52,041 --> 00:20:53,500
by splitting the ground open.

468
00:20:53,583 --> 00:20:56,250
Now it's hard to see anything.

469
00:20:56,333 --> 00:20:59,750
Wait. Eraser! Are you
actually worried?

470
00:20:59,833 --> 00:21:02,291
There's something I've realized
after watching my students.

471
00:21:02,375 --> 00:21:04,458
In school and in the field.

472
00:21:04,541 --> 00:21:06,500
They might not have
realized it themselves,

473
00:21:06,583 --> 00:21:09,208
but in Class 1-A,
there are two people

474
00:21:09,291 --> 00:21:11,583
whose spirits have a big impact.

475
00:21:12,875 --> 00:21:15,125
[AIZAWA] They're not leaders,
or the most popular.

476
00:21:15,208 --> 00:21:17,416
And the two of them
don't get along at all.

477
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:20,083
Sometimes they seem
like polar opposites.

478
00:21:20,166 --> 00:21:22,375
However, before I knew it,

479
00:21:22,458 --> 00:21:25,416
their passion had spread
to the rest of their peers.

480
00:21:28,291 --> 00:21:29,541
[AIZAWA]
It's strange.

481
00:21:29,625 --> 00:21:31,666
But every time there's
some kind of major event,

482
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:33,750
one of them is at
the center of it.

483
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:38,208
[AIZAWA]
I'm not worried, Joke.

484
00:21:38,291 --> 00:21:40,041
It's the opposite, actually.

485
00:21:40,125 --> 00:21:41,958
I can't wait to see
what they'll do.

486
00:21:42,041 --> 00:21:44,541
Even if those two aren't
physically with the others,

487
00:21:44,625 --> 00:21:48,416
their presence raises the
standard for the entire class.

488
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:52,458
[MS JOKE] You've fallen for
them hard. It's kinda gross.

489
00:21:52,541 --> 00:21:56,166
I'm honored to have
them as students.

490
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:58,250
My Class 1-A!

491
00:23:29,166 --> 00:23:30,416
[IZUKU]
Here's the preview!

492
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:32,541
It's the final few minutes
of the licensing exam's

493
00:23:32,625 --> 00:23:35,041
first round, and the rest
of my classmates and I

494
00:23:35,125 --> 00:23:38,750
are fighting desperately.
I refuse to let us fail!

495
00:23:38,833 --> 00:23:40,666
Next time: "RUSH!"

496
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:43,541
Go beyond! Plus Ultra!
