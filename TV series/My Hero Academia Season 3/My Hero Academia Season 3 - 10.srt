to pass through.

answering me anymore.

It's possible they failed
at the Nomu factory.

00:03:56,625 --> 00:03:58,916
This is putting a lot
of stress on my power.

there must be an architect

behind the League of Villains.

71
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,541
It's likely that his strength
is comparable to All Might's.

72
00:05:06,625 --> 00:05:09,333
He will be crafty and cautious.

73
00:05:09,416 --> 00:05:11,791
If he doesn't feel like
his safety is guaranteed,

74
00:05:11,875 --> 00:05:13,833
he will not reveal himself.

75
00:05:13,916 --> 00:05:17,125
So you must capture Shigaraki
and the others quickly.

76
00:05:17,208 --> 00:05:20,291
Then move on to their leader.

supposed to go like this.

Now, I see.

Your strength
comes from practice

and practical experience,
not raw power.

84

I don't need your Quirk.

00:09:37,833 --> 00:09:40,708
Aren't you
overexerting yourself?

160
00:09:40,791 --> 00:09:43,750
[KATSUKI] He held All Might
back with his bare hands!

161
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:46,750
This guy must be
the boss villain!

162
00:09:46,833 --> 00:09:50,125
I won't repeat the mistake
I made five years ago.

163
00:09:50,208 --> 00:09:52,000
You hear me?

164
00:09:52,083 --> 00:09:54,708
I will take Young Bakugo back.

165
00:09:54,791 --> 00:09:57,083
And I will make certain
you're locked up

166
00:09:57,166 --> 00:09:59,708
for the rest of your sad life.

167
00:09:59,791 --> 00:10:03,583
Right along with your despicable
League of Villains.

168
00:10:03,666 --> 00:10:05,250
[ALL FOR ONE]
Sounds like you've got your work

169
00:10:05,333 --> 00:10:08,750
cut out for you. This will
be hard for us both.

170
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:20,833
[ALL FOR ONE] Hm. Air Cannon
plus Spring-like Limbs.

171
00:10:20,916 --> 00:10:25,958
Kinetic Booster times four.
Strength Enhancer times three.

172
00:10:26,041 --> 00:10:28,416
What a delightful combination.

173
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:31,500
Maybe a few more
enhancers next time.

174
00:10:33,875 --> 00:10:36,166
[gasps] All Might!

175
00:10:37,208 --> 00:10:38,541
[ALL FOR ONE]
Don't you worry.

176
00:10:38,625 --> 00:10:41,541
It'll take more than
that to kill him.

177
00:10:41,625 --> 00:10:43,791
Get off the battlefield, Tomura.

178
00:10:43,875 --> 00:10:46,000
And take that child with you.

179
00:10:48,125 --> 00:10:50,333
[ALL FOR ONE]
Kurogiri. Warp them away.

180
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:51,833
[MAGNE]
Be careful!

181
00:10:51,916 --> 00:10:53,750
One of the heroes messed with
him and he's unconscious.

182
00:10:53,833 --> 00:10:56,416
I'm not sure what's going on,
but if you can teleport,

183
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:58,250
why don't you get
us out of here?

184
00:10:58,333 --> 00:11:00,833
[ALL FOR ONE] My warp power
is still new, Magne.

185
00:11:00,916 --> 00:11:03,416
There is much I need
to learn about it.

186
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:06,166
Its distance is limited,
and while he can

187
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:08,250
teleport to
specific coordinates,

188
00:11:08,333 --> 00:11:12,250
I only transport people
to and from my own location.

189
00:11:12,333 --> 00:11:14,541
Or, with focus,
to or from someone

190
00:11:14,625 --> 00:11:18,208
I am very familiar with.
That is all.

191
00:11:18,291 --> 00:11:21,000
It's easier to have
Kurogiri do it.

[ALL MIGHT yells]

195
00:11:35,583 --> 00:11:37,958
[ALL FOR ONE]
You're not thinking, Tomura.

196
00:11:38,041 --> 00:11:41,125
There remains much room
for you to grow.

197
00:11:41,208 --> 00:11:42,625
You're mine!

198
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:47,041
[SHIGARAKI]
Master.

199
00:11:47,125 --> 00:11:48,708
[MR. COMPRESS]
Let's go, Shigaraki.

200
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:51,791
While our masked lead is
keeping All Might entertained.

201
00:11:51,875 --> 00:11:53,125
Claim your prize.

202
00:11:56,083 --> 00:11:58,583
Huh. This is gonna be fun.

203
00:11:59,916 --> 00:12:01,541
Young Bakugo, don't!

204
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:05,166
[IZUKU]
All Might!

205
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:09,000
All For One is in the way,
so he can't get to Kacchan!

206
00:12:09,083 --> 00:12:10,250
If something doesn't change,

207
00:12:10,333 --> 00:12:13,833
the League will escape
with my friend. Again.

208
00:12:13,916 --> 00:12:15,250
They've got him surrounded,

209
00:12:15,333 --> 00:12:17,541
so he can't escape by himself!

210
00:12:19,125 --> 00:12:21,000
[KATSUKI]
These guys know I'm screwed.

211
00:12:21,083 --> 00:12:22,708
It's six against one,

212
00:12:22,791 --> 00:12:25,916
and they're willing to drag me
out of here by force this time.

213
00:12:28,208 --> 00:12:30,750
[KATSUKI] I can't let that
magician lay a finger on me.

214
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:33,458
I'm coming for you.

215
00:12:33,541 --> 00:12:37,625
[ALL FOR ONE] I don't
think so. Because I am here.

[ALL MIGHT yells]

217
00:12:42,125 --> 00:12:45,291
[IZUKU] All Might and Kacchan
are both completely stuck.

218
00:12:45,375 --> 00:12:47,666
What now?

219
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:49,250
[TSURAGAMAE]
That's why it's against the law

220
00:12:49,333 --> 00:12:52,500
for uncertified people to use
their Quirks to cause injury.

221
00:12:52,583 --> 00:12:55,708
None of you had the authority
to harm the villain.

222
00:12:55,791 --> 00:12:57,541
[SHOJI]
I'm upset, too.

223
00:12:57,625 --> 00:13:01,458
But... We can't let our
emotions get the best of us.

224
00:13:01,541 --> 00:13:03,958
If you know that you're
breaking the rules,

225
00:13:04,041 --> 00:13:07,000
then you're acting like
villains, not heroes.

226
00:13:07,083 --> 00:13:10,541
Why did it have to be
you two of all people?

227
00:13:10,625 --> 00:13:11,916
Why are you trying
to make the same

228
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,666
stupid mistakes I made?

229
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:16,375
[IZUKU]
It's no use.

230
00:13:16,458 --> 00:13:19,625
As heroes-in-training,
we're not allowed to fight.

231
00:13:21,291 --> 00:13:22,541
[IZUKU]
But maybe...

232
00:13:22,625 --> 00:13:24,000
If there's an opening...

233
00:13:24,083 --> 00:13:25,166
An instant...

234
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:26,666
We might have a
chance to swoop in

235
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:30,041
and grab Kacchan.
And if we can save him,

236
00:13:30,125 --> 00:13:32,791
All Might can use the
full extent of his power.

237
00:13:34,291 --> 00:13:36,375
[IZUKU]
But how?

238
00:13:36,458 --> 00:13:38,541
Nothing seems like it'll work.

239
00:13:39,791 --> 00:13:42,625
[IZUKU]
Come on. Think.

240
00:13:42,708 --> 00:13:45,291
Somehow, we can help
him out of this!

241
00:13:47,791 --> 00:13:50,000
[IZUKU gasps]
Yes.

242
00:13:50,083 --> 00:13:51,666
Iida. Listen!

243
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:53,666
You can't fight.
I won't let you.

244
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:55,875
No, I think there's another way!

245
00:13:55,958 --> 00:13:58,041
A way that won't
involve any combat.

246
00:13:58,125 --> 00:14:00,041
That'll let us escape. With him.

247
00:14:00,125 --> 00:14:03,500
Come on, we can still
get Kacchan back!

248
00:14:05,333 --> 00:14:07,250
Tell us your plan.

249
00:14:07,333 --> 00:14:11,166
The thing is, it's all
going to depend on him.

250
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:13,833
[KATSUKI]
Stay back, Deku!

251
00:14:13,916 --> 00:14:15,666
I just don't know, you guys.

252
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:17,458
Think about what
Bakugo would want.

253
00:14:17,541 --> 00:14:20,458
We'd just make everything
worse I'm afraid.

254
00:14:20,541 --> 00:14:22,625
[IZUKU]
If I did the plan myself,

255
00:14:22,708 --> 00:14:26,541
I don't think it would
work. So, Kirishima.

256
00:14:26,625 --> 00:14:29,125
You're the key to this
being a success!

[gasps]

258

We need details Midoriya. C'mon.

259
00:14:32,708 --> 00:14:36,375
Right. Here's what I'm thinking.

Trying to keep the boy
from being blown away?

264
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:50,833
You've put yourself
in quite the predicament.

265
00:14:50,916 --> 00:14:53,583
So how will the "hero" prevail?

266
00:14:54,625 --> 00:14:55,916

[KATSUKI grunts]

268
00:14:58,041 --> 00:14:59,750
[KATSUKI] It'll be hard for

--Are you out of your mind?

271
00:15:05,708 --> 00:15:07,500
[IZUKU] Kacchan will have
realized the situation

272
00:15:07,583 --> 00:15:09,208
that All Might's in.

273
00:15:09,291 --> 00:15:10,708
I agree.

274
00:15:10,791 --> 00:15:12,666
He's staying on the
defensive with his enemies,

275
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:15,541
keeping his distance.
That's good for us.

276
00:15:15,625 --> 00:15:17,250
We have to move when
he's got some space

277
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:19,041
between him and the villains.

278

Iida...

279
00:15:20,625 --> 00:15:23,750
It is a gamble.
But all things considered,

280
00:15:23,833 --> 00:15:25,541
there's not much risk to us.

281
00:15:25,625 --> 00:15:29,416
And more importantly, it could
change the tide of this fight.

282
00:15:33,083 --> 00:15:34,291
[TENYA]
I'm in.

283
00:15:35,875 --> 00:15:37,791
[IZUKU]
This is what we do.

284
00:15:37,875 --> 00:15:40,333
First, we'll propel
ourselves using my Quirk,

285
00:15:40,416 --> 00:15:42,333
combined with Iida's Recipro.

286
00:15:44,291 --> 00:15:46,791
[IZUKU] Then, using
Kirishima's hardening...

287
00:15:48,666 --> 00:15:50,958
[IZUKU]
...we'll break through the wall.

288
00:15:51,041 --> 00:15:52,250
The second we've cleared it,

289
00:15:52,333 --> 00:15:54,916
Todoroki will make a huge
slab of ice for us.

290
00:15:56,208 --> 00:15:59,208
[IZUKU]
As high as he possibly can.

291
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:01,541
The villains haven't
noticed us yet.

292
00:16:01,625 --> 00:16:04,208
Up until now, they've been
able to outmaneuver us.

293
00:16:04,291 --> 00:16:05,625
But we're finally
in the position

294
00:16:05,708 --> 00:16:07,333
to get the jump on them.

295
00:16:08,833 --> 00:16:10,458
[IZUKU] And we'll cross the
battlefield at a height

296
00:16:10,541 --> 00:16:12,583
that they'll never
hope to reach.

297
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,708
[IZUKU] Right now, the guy
in charge of the villains

298
00:16:15,791 --> 00:16:17,833
is holding All Might back.

299
00:16:17,916 --> 00:16:20,250
But that means the
reverse is true, too.

300
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:24,208
[IZUKU] The last part's
up to you, Kirishima.

301
00:16:24,291 --> 00:16:25,958
It's no good if I do it.

or Iida, or Yaoyorozu.

00:17:00,916 --> 00:17:03,083
It's not the time
to fight, you guys!

314
00:17:03,166 --> 00:17:05,791
Just as we thought.
All eyes on them.

315
00:17:05,875 --> 00:17:06,958
This is our chance.

316
00:17:07,041 --> 00:17:09,041
Let's go!

317
00:17:09,125 --> 00:17:11,958
[SHIGARAKI] Why do you keep
showing up everywhere?

318
00:17:12,041 --> 00:17:14,666
Seriously? You kids.

319
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:15,791
[MR. COMPRESS]
Don't let them get away!

320
00:17:15,875 --> 00:17:16,875
Who can do distance?

321
00:17:16,958 --> 00:17:19,125
Kurogiri and Dabi.
But, they're down!

322
00:17:19,208 --> 00:17:20,291
[MAGNE]
You two, come here!

323
00:17:20,375 --> 00:17:22,250
[PRESENT MIC]
Magne's Quirk: Magnetism.

324
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:24,250
Its wielder can apply
a magnetic force

325
00:17:24,333 --> 00:17:26,791
to anyone within
a 4.5 meter radius!

326
00:17:26,875 --> 00:17:29,250
And focus on a whole
body or just a part.

327
00:17:29,333 --> 00:17:32,083
Men become south poles and
women become north poles.

328
00:17:32,166 --> 00:17:34,791
Magnetism doesn't work
on Magne, though.

329
00:17:34,875 --> 00:17:35,958
Ready!

330
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:39,000
[MR. COMPRESS]
Repulsion Breakup.

331
00:17:39,083 --> 00:17:40,500
Night Flight Cannon!

332
00:17:40,583 --> 00:17:42,875
[MT. LADY]
Titan Cliff!

333
00:17:44,333 --> 00:17:45,958
Whoa, Mt. Lady!

334
00:17:46,041 --> 00:17:48,750
The rescue's priority.

335
00:17:48,833 --> 00:17:50,833
Go home, you dumb kids.

336
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,666
[MAGNE] We can still
catch them! C'mon, you two.

337
00:17:59,625 --> 00:18:02,291
[IZUKU gasps]
Gran Torino!

338
00:18:02,375 --> 00:18:03,291
You're too slow.

339
00:18:03,375 --> 00:18:05,333
You're just too fast, hot shot.

340
00:18:05,416 --> 00:18:07,041
So, you saw the kid, right?

341
00:18:07,125 --> 00:18:09,833
He's turning out to be more
and more like you every day.

342
00:18:09,916 --> 00:18:11,291
Not a compliment.

343
00:18:11,375 --> 00:18:14,291
[ALL MIGHT] Tch. After his
experience in Hosu...

344
00:18:14,375 --> 00:18:16,541
I didn't think he'd come
to the battlefield.

345
00:18:16,625 --> 00:18:18,291
Damn teenagers!

346
00:18:21,291 --> 00:18:24,208
[ALL FOR ONE]
Shimura's friend, huh?

347
00:18:24,291 --> 00:18:27,458
[ALL MIGHT coughs] It's shameful
that I needed their help.

348
00:18:27,541 --> 00:18:28,666
But now,

349
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:31,625
I don't have to pull
any punches against you.

350
00:18:31,708 --> 00:18:33,625
You're finished.

351
00:18:33,708 --> 00:18:36,916
[GRAN TORINO] Two left
over here. I'll handle them.

352
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,583
Tomura, I do not wanna
die in this place.

353
00:18:39,666 --> 00:18:41,000
[ALL FOR ONE]
They got us.

354
00:18:41,083 --> 00:18:44,208
Turned the tables of this
fight with a single move.

355
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:50,791
[ALL FOR ONE] Forcible Quick
Activation. Magnetism!

356
00:18:50,875 --> 00:18:52,041
[SHIGARAKI]
You are dust!

357
00:18:52,125 --> 00:18:53,291
[GRAN TORINO grunts]

358
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:56,083
Huh?

359
00:18:56,166 --> 00:18:57,083
Huh?

360
00:18:57,166 --> 00:18:58,541
Huh?

361
00:18:58,625 --> 00:19:01,458
Hey! Watch out, you guys!
You'r coming at me too fast!

362
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,125
[SHIGARAKI]
Wait. Don't. Master!

363
00:19:07,208 --> 00:19:08,458
Not so fast.

364
00:19:10,708 --> 00:19:13,000
[SHIGARAKI]
Your body is too damaged!

365
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:20,125
[ALL FOR ONE] No one's come
to save you, have they?

366
00:19:20,208 --> 00:19:23,958
You've had a hard life,
Tenko Shimura.

367
00:19:25,416 --> 00:19:29,541
[ALL FOR ONE]
Don't worry. I am here for you.

368
00:19:30,708 --> 00:19:33,333
No, I... won't go!

369
00:19:36,458 --> 00:19:39,958
[ALL FOR ONE] Tomura.
You must continue to fight.

370
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:45,833
[ALL FOR ONE] "Warping."
Plus "Shock Inversion"!

371
00:19:50,708 --> 00:19:52,750
[ALL MIGHT grunts]
I'm sorry!

372
00:19:53,916 --> 00:19:56,708
[ALL FOR ONE]
I only came to save Tomura.

373
00:19:56,791 --> 00:19:58,958
But if you say you're
going to fight,

374
00:19:59,041 --> 00:20:01,416
then I'll face you as you wish.

375
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,916
In the past, your fist crushed

376
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,875
one after another
of my comrades.

377
00:20:06,958 --> 00:20:10,625
Many were forced into
the shadows, underground.

378
00:20:10,708 --> 00:20:14,041
While you were extolled
as the Symbol of Peace.

379
00:20:14,125 --> 00:20:18,708
What a grand view you must have
had from atop our sacrifices.

380
00:20:18,791 --> 00:20:23,000
A hero standing on the
mountain of our defeats.

381
00:20:23,083 --> 00:20:28,333
Detroit... Smash!

382
00:20:29,583 --> 00:20:30,875
[ALL MIGHT grunts]

383
00:20:38,583 --> 00:20:41,791
[ALL FOR ONE]
He stopped the attack himself.

384
00:20:41,875 --> 00:20:45,166
You still won't fight me
with your full power, huh?

385
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:48,166
Because doing so would
endanger all those people

386
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:50,875
you've sworn to protect.

387
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:52,708
You shut up.

388
00:20:52,791 --> 00:20:53,916
[ALL FOR ONE gasps]

389
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,541
[ALL MIGHT]
Always toying with people,

390
00:20:55,625 --> 00:20:57,750
probing their weaknesses.

391
00:20:57,833 --> 00:21:00,083
You steal. Break them.

392
00:21:00,166 --> 00:21:03,250
Manipulate and discard them.

393
00:21:03,333 --> 00:21:06,166
You scoff at innocent people

394
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:09,458
who are just trying
to lead happy lives!

395
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,291
[ALL MIGHT]
It cannot continue.

396
00:21:13,375 --> 00:21:14,791
[ALL FOR ONE]
It's over.

397
00:21:14,875 --> 00:21:16,750
I won't let it!

398
00:21:23,125 --> 00:21:24,833
[GRAN TORINO groans]

399
00:21:24,916 --> 00:21:28,916
[gasps] Toshinori.

400
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,416
[ALL MIGHT panting]

401
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:33,625
[GRAN TORINO]
You've reached your limit.

402
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:36,416
[ALL FOR ONE]
What's wrong?

403
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:37,958
[gasps]

404
00:21:38,041 --> 00:21:39,333
[ALL FOR ONE]
You seem to be worked up

405
00:21:39,416 --> 00:21:42,125
about something, All Might.

406
00:21:42,208 --> 00:21:45,875
I've heard that same exact
line before, you know.

407
00:21:45,958 --> 00:21:47,375
[ALL FOR ONE cackles]

408
00:21:47,458 --> 00:21:48,958
[ALL MIGHT gasps]

409
00:21:49,041 --> 00:21:54,000
[ALL FOR ONE] From the person
who had One for All before you.

410
00:21:54,083 --> 00:21:56,416
Nana Shimura.

411
00:23:28,958 --> 00:23:30,250
[IZUKU]
Here's the preview!

412
00:23:30,333 --> 00:23:32,166
The Symbol of Peace, All Might,

413
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:35,083
and the Symbol of Evil,
All For One go head-to-head

414
00:23:35,166 --> 00:23:36,708
in an epic battle.

415
00:23:36,791 --> 00:23:38,583
We saved Kacchan
and left the scene,

416
00:23:38,666 --> 00:23:41,000
so the only thing we can do
now is watch the fight play out

417
00:23:41,083 --> 00:23:43,208
along with the
rest of the world.

418
00:23:43,291 --> 00:23:45,916
Even after the secret he's
been hiding is exposed,

419
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,416
All Might continues to stand up

420
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:49,291
against the villain
in front of him.

421
00:23:49,375 --> 00:23:51,458
Next time: "One For All."

422
00:23:51,541 --> 00:23:55,000
This could be the final shining
moment for the number-one hero!

423
00:23:55,083 --> 00:23:57,791
Go beyond! Plus Ultra!
