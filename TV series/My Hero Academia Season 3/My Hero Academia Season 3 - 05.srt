00:00:10,375 --> 00:00:12,958
[IZUKU] Welcome to UA High,
the prestigious school

2
00:00:13,041 --> 00:00:16,125
that's turned out some of
the world's greatest heroes.

3
00:00:16,208 --> 00:00:18,208
I'm running toward my
dream in these halls.

4
00:00:18,291 --> 00:00:20,375
Learning to overcome
obstacles and save people

5
00:00:20,458 --> 00:00:22,833
with a smile on my face.

6
00:00:22,916 --> 00:00:25,833
That's how I'll become the
greatest hero in the world!

7
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,583
[MUSCULAR]
Show me your blood!

8
00:02:05,666 --> 00:02:07,666
[ALL MIGHT]
A real hero...

9
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:11,875
...will always find a way
for justice to be served!

10
00:02:11,958 --> 00:02:16,666
[IZUKU] Please, forgive me,
Mom. I tried my best.

11
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:18,833
I'm sorry...

12
00:02:18,916 --> 00:02:20,916
...All Might.

13
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I'm gonna crush you.

14
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,833
What the...? Is that water?

15
00:02:35,916 --> 00:02:39,791
[KOTA]
Stop. Let him go!

16
00:02:41,208 --> 00:02:42,750
[IZUKU]
Ko... ta?

17
00:02:42,833 --> 00:02:44,541
Hold on, there, 'kay?

18
00:02:44,625 --> 00:02:46,875
I'll kill you after
I'm done with--

19
00:02:48,041 --> 00:02:50,208
[MUSCULAR]
Crap. I was distracted.

20
00:02:50,291 --> 00:02:52,958
I won't let you hurt Kota.

21
00:02:53,041 --> 00:02:55,375
Damn it. How are you
getting stronger?

22
00:02:55,458 --> 00:03:00,583
You won't lay a hand on him!

23
00:03:00,666 --> 00:03:05,916
One for All.
One million percent!

24
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:15,666
Delaware... Detroit Smash!

25
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:18,708
[IZUKU yells]

26
00:03:30,083 --> 00:03:33,166
[KUROGIRI] You're sure they'll
be all right on their own?

27
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:36,083
[SHIGARAKI] I'm a non-playable
character this level.

28
00:03:36,166 --> 00:03:38,375
They'll make it work without me.

29
00:03:38,458 --> 00:03:41,916
Besides, this game
has totally changed.

30
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,583
I've been thinking
of it as an RPG.

31
00:03:44,666 --> 00:03:46,125
We had some pretty good equips,

32
00:03:46,208 --> 00:03:50,375
but we challenged the big boss
while still at Level One.

33
00:03:50,458 --> 00:03:53,916
Really, it's more of
a simulation game.

34
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,333
I'm the player.

35
00:03:55,416 --> 00:03:57,166
And I'll use all my little pawns

36
00:03:57,250 --> 00:04:00,458
to smash through
the heroes' ranks.

37
00:04:00,541 --> 00:04:01,708
But first,

38
00:04:01,791 --> 00:04:05,125
I need to make cracks
in the superhuman world.

39
00:04:05,208 --> 00:04:07,208
That's where the
Vanguard Action Squad

40
00:04:07,291 --> 00:04:09,875
of the League of
Villains comes in.

41
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:12,708
Who cares if these
guys win or lose?

42
00:04:12,791 --> 00:04:15,833
The heroes will be scared
just because they showed up.

43
00:04:15,916 --> 00:04:17,708
[KUROGIRI]
They're sacrificial pawns?

44
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:19,083
[SHIGARAKI]
Come on.

45
00:04:19,166 --> 00:04:21,583
Do you really think
I'm that heartless?

46
00:04:21,666 --> 00:04:24,583
I'd never underestimate
their strength.

47
00:04:24,666 --> 00:04:26,750
They may have different
goals than me,

48
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:29,583
but they're
comrades, nonetheless.

49
00:04:29,666 --> 00:04:33,000
In a society bound
by ridiculous rules,

50
00:04:33,083 --> 00:04:37,208
villains aren't the only ones
who are being oppressed.

51
00:04:37,291 --> 00:04:40,000
Let's hope they can
pull this off.

52
00:04:42,958 --> 00:04:50,458
[IZUKU panting]

53
00:04:53,833 --> 00:04:55,541
[gasps] Hey!

54
00:04:56,833 --> 00:04:58,458
Everything's okay.

55
00:04:58,541 --> 00:05:00,041
Gimme a second, and then
there's something

56
00:05:00,125 --> 00:05:01,791
I have to take care of.

57
00:05:01,875 --> 00:05:02,958
But you're all beat up!

58
00:05:03,041 --> 00:05:05,916
What more could
you have to do now?

59
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,041
[IZUKU]
I knew he'd be strong.

60
00:05:08,125 --> 00:05:12,041
That's why I had to try
to defeat him here.

61
00:05:12,125 --> 00:05:14,500
I thought I'd be able to
inflict a lot more damage

62
00:05:14,583 --> 00:05:17,125
in the end, though. Turns out,

63
00:05:17,208 --> 00:05:21,666
I seriously underestimated
how powerful his Quirk was.

64
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:25,083
If every villain attacking us
tonight is on the same level,

65
00:05:25,166 --> 00:05:27,916
all our lives are at stake.

66
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,250
On top of that,

67
00:05:29,333 --> 00:05:31,541
it sounds like they're
after some of us students.

68
00:05:31,625 --> 00:05:34,000
I have to let Mr. Aizawa
and the Pussycats know

69
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:37,166
that's one of the
reasons they're here.

70
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:39,583
I may be injured,
but I'm not defeated yet,

71
00:05:39,666 --> 00:05:41,916
there are more
people I can save.

72
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:46,291
[IZUKU] We'll leave this villain
here for the time being.

73
00:05:46,375 --> 00:05:48,500
With my arms messed up,
my smash was probably

74
00:05:48,583 --> 00:05:49,958
weaker than it could have been,

75
00:05:50,041 --> 00:05:52,916
but it I still think it's
taken him down for a while.

76
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
He won't wake up anytime soon.

77
00:05:55,083 --> 00:05:57,750
And even if he did,
he'd be too weak to fight.

78
00:05:57,833 --> 00:05:59,083
For right now,

79
00:05:59,166 --> 00:06:01,916
I just need to make
sure you're safe.

80
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,750
We're gonna need some help
only you can give us.

81
00:06:04,833 --> 00:06:06,833
The forest has been
set on fire.

82
00:06:06,916 --> 00:06:10,083
That means my friends could
be trapped by the flames.

83
00:06:10,166 --> 00:06:11,666
But we have hope.

84
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:13,916
Your water Quirk can
put those fires out.

85
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,916
[gasps]

86
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Kota? You hear me?

87
00:06:18,083 --> 00:06:19,708
We need you.

88
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:27,958
[IZUKU]
Now, get on my back.

89
00:06:28,041 --> 00:06:29,916
We need to get you
to camp, fast.

90
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,375
[KOTA]
You sure you can carry me?

91
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:32,375
You're all busted up.

92
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:34,583
[IZUKU]
No need to worry.

93
00:06:34,666 --> 00:06:37,083
That's why I left
my legs unbroken!

94
00:06:37,166 --> 00:06:39,583
Hang on tight.
This could be rough.

95
00:06:39,666 --> 00:06:40,916
[KOTA gasps]

96
00:06:42,875 --> 00:06:44,333
Do you know where
a kid named Bakugo

97
00:06:44,416 --> 00:06:46,458
might be around here?

98
00:06:46,541 --> 00:06:49,000
[IZUKU] I've got a bad
feeling about this.

99
00:06:51,583 --> 00:06:53,708
[AIZAWA] I'll look after the
other students. Protect them.

100
00:06:53,791 --> 00:06:55,083
[MONOMA]
Wasn't this a secret?

101
00:06:56,458 --> 00:06:58,583
[AIZAWA]
If it's a full-scale attack...

102
00:07:00,458 --> 00:07:02,208
[AIZAWA]
We're in big trouble.

103
00:07:03,458 --> 00:07:06,375
Looks like your concern
has you distracted, Eraser.

104
00:07:06,458 --> 00:07:07,416
[AIZAWA]
Vlad!

105
00:07:13,791 --> 00:07:17,416
Nice move. Guess you
really are a pro.

106
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,041
[AIZAWA]
Not so fast.

107
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:23,500
[DABI grunts]

108
00:07:25,125 --> 00:07:26,083
What do you want,

109
00:07:26,166 --> 00:07:27,708
and where are your
friends hiding?

110
00:07:27,791 --> 00:07:29,625
[DABI grunts]
My what?

111
00:07:29,708 --> 00:07:30,875
Your right arm's next.

112
00:07:30,958 --> 00:07:32,125
[DABI grunts]

113
00:07:32,208 --> 00:07:35,416
Be logical about this.
At least save your legs.

114
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:36,666
It would be a real pain

115
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:38,416
to have to carry you off
to jail without them.

116
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:41,541
You can take your
time, Eraserhead.

117
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,041
[AIZAWA gasps]
What's that?

118
00:07:45,125 --> 00:07:46,333
[TENYA]
Mr. Aizawa!

119
00:07:46,416 --> 00:07:47,375
[ALL panting]

120
00:07:47,458 --> 00:07:48,875
[AIZAWA]
Stay back.

121
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:53,958
[DABI]
He's good.

122
00:07:54,041 --> 00:07:56,875
I won't be able to
take much more of this.

123
00:07:56,958 --> 00:07:58,916
[DABI] That's exactly the
performance I'd expect

124
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,041
out of a UA teacher.
Tell me, hero.

125
00:08:03,125 --> 00:08:05,833
You worried for your students?

126
00:08:05,916 --> 00:08:09,333
[AIZAWA] The fire that he shot
earlier wasn't his Quirk?

127
00:08:09,416 --> 00:08:11,958
I wonder if you can
save them in the end.

128
00:08:12,041 --> 00:08:13,416
See you soon.

129
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,333
What was that? Did he just melt?

130
00:08:17,416 --> 00:08:18,375
[gasps]

131
00:08:18,458 --> 00:08:20,333
Everyone get inside.
I'll be back.

132
00:08:22,125 --> 00:08:24,083
[TWICE groans]
Come on, Dabi!

133
00:08:24,166 --> 00:08:26,958
You got your ass handed
to you! By a magic scarf!

134
00:08:27,041 --> 00:08:29,041
How weak. That
happened fast, huh?

135
00:08:29,125 --> 00:08:30,583
[TWICE]
Huh? Don't say that.

136
00:08:30,666 --> 00:08:33,458
Better to frame this as
the pro being too strong.

137
00:08:33,541 --> 00:08:35,416
It's important to mind
your self-esteem,

138
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,083
even on a perilous mission.

139
00:08:37,166 --> 00:08:39,625
Whatever, Twice. Just
make another one of me.

140
00:08:39,708 --> 00:08:41,708
We need to keep
those pros occupied.

141
00:08:41,791 --> 00:08:43,958
[TWICE] Another small fry,
comin' right up.

142
00:08:44,041 --> 00:08:45,500
Leave it to me.

143
00:08:47,166 --> 00:08:48,708
[IZUKU]
Just a little bit further.

144
00:08:48,791 --> 00:08:51,416
[gasps] Hey, look!

145
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,375
[IZUKU]
Mr. Aizawa!

146
00:08:53,458 --> 00:08:55,333
Midoriya--

147
00:08:55,416 --> 00:08:58,833
[IZUKU]
You're here. Thank goodness.

148
00:08:58,916 --> 00:09:00,375
I need to catch you up
on what I've learned

149
00:09:00,458 --> 00:09:02,541
about the villains,
but we don't have much time.

150
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:04,125
--[AIZAWA] Hey.
--Plus, I need to find Mandalay.

151
00:09:04,208 --> 00:09:05,458
There's something
I have to tell her.

152
00:09:05,541 --> 00:09:06,708
Hold on!

153
00:09:06,791 --> 00:09:08,458
[IZUKU] Please take care
of Kota while I'm gone!

154
00:09:08,541 --> 00:09:10,833
[AIZAWA] This kid is running
on pure adrenaline.

155
00:09:10,916 --> 00:09:11,708
[IZUKU]
I'll be back soon!

156
00:09:11,791 --> 00:09:12,750
Wait, Midoriya!

157
00:09:12,833 --> 00:09:13,791
[IZUKU grunts]

158
00:09:15,041 --> 00:09:16,958
[sighs] Those injuries...

159
00:09:17,041 --> 00:09:19,166
You went too far again,
didn't you?

160
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:21,458
Have you forgotten about Hosu?

161
00:09:21,541 --> 00:09:22,750
Uh...

162
00:09:22,833 --> 00:09:24,333
[TSURAGAMAE]
That's why it's against the law

163
00:09:24,416 --> 00:09:27,958
for uncertified people to use
their Quirks to cause injury.

164
00:09:28,041 --> 00:09:30,375
None of you had the authority
to harm the villain.

165
00:09:30,458 --> 00:09:32,541
No. I haven't.

166
00:09:32,625 --> 00:09:33,708
[AIZAWA]
Go.

167
00:09:33,791 --> 00:09:36,541
But tell Mandalay
something for me, too.

168
00:09:36,625 --> 00:09:37,708
[gasps]

169
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,083
[TIGER growls]

170
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,625
No fair. Back off.

171
00:09:46,708 --> 00:09:48,083
Let me equip my item.

172
00:09:48,166 --> 00:09:49,500
[TIGER growls]

173
00:09:50,833 --> 00:09:51,791
[TIGER]
Damn it.

174
00:09:51,875 --> 00:09:54,500
How is he predicting
my Cat Combat?

175
00:09:55,583 --> 00:09:57,166
You're not...

176
00:09:58,583 --> 00:10:00,625
...a real hero!

177
00:10:02,041 --> 00:10:05,000
You brought this
on yourself, girl!

178
00:10:05,083 --> 00:10:06,541
[MANDALAY]
Jeez, you're persistent.

179
00:10:06,625 --> 00:10:08,000
[SPINNER]
As are you.

180
00:10:08,083 --> 00:10:09,875
But it's time to knock you
off your false throne.

181
00:10:09,958 --> 00:10:11,791
[IZUKU]
Smash!

182
00:10:13,083 --> 00:10:13,791
[gasps]

183
00:10:13,875 --> 00:10:16,583
Mandalay! Kota! He's safe!

184
00:10:16,666 --> 00:10:18,125
You found him?

185
00:10:19,291 --> 00:10:21,541
[IZUKU] And I've got
a message from Mr. Aizawa.

186
00:10:21,625 --> 00:10:24,333
We need you to use Telepath!

187
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:26,458
[DABI]
Tell me, hero.

188
00:10:26,541 --> 00:10:28,708
Are you worried
for your students?

189
00:10:28,791 --> 00:10:31,250
I wonder if you can
save them in the end.

190
00:10:31,333 --> 00:10:32,500
[AIZAWA]
His words made it clear to me

191
00:10:32,583 --> 00:10:34,666
that our students
are the targets.

192
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:38,125
So it's unavoidable.
They have to protect themselves.

193
00:10:38,208 --> 00:10:40,166
And each other.

194
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:42,041
Go ahead and use your training.

195
00:10:42,125 --> 00:10:43,625
I'll take the heat.

196
00:10:43,708 --> 00:10:45,750
Tell everyone in
Class A and Class B

197
00:10:45,833 --> 00:10:47,583
that Eraser Head has
granted them permission

198
00:10:47,666 --> 00:10:50,000
to engage in combat
with the villains.

199
00:10:52,333 --> 00:10:54,708
[MANDALAY]
Everyone in Class A and Class B!

200
00:10:54,791 --> 00:10:56,708
In the name of the
pro hero, Eraserhead,

201
00:10:56,791 --> 00:10:59,458
you are granted permission
to engage in combat.

202
00:10:59,541 --> 00:11:01,625
I repeat. Use your training.

203
00:11:01,708 --> 00:11:04,083
You may fight these villains.

204
00:11:04,166 --> 00:11:06,625
[MANDALAY] I hope you know
what you're doing, Eraser.

205
00:11:08,416 --> 00:11:10,125
[AIZAWA]
Future heroes.

206
00:11:10,208 --> 00:11:13,208
Do not let this night be
the end of your journey!

207
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:25,041
[AIZAWA]
I forgot to tell Midoriya

208
00:11:25,125 --> 00:11:26,750
to come back right away.

209
00:11:26,833 --> 00:11:28,250
This is bad.

210
00:11:28,333 --> 00:11:29,666
The only reason
he's still going

211
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:31,625
with those injuries is
because of the endorphins

212
00:11:31,708 --> 00:11:34,583
pumping through his body.
It's temporary.

213
00:11:34,666 --> 00:11:36,875
Once he's accomplished his goals
and calms down a little,

214
00:11:36,958 --> 00:11:38,708
he won't be able to move at all.

215
00:11:38,791 --> 00:11:43,041
[KOTA]
Mister. Is he gonna be okay?

216
00:11:43,125 --> 00:11:48,083
I... I sort of
punched him before.

217
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:53,416
And still, he got beat to a pulp
just so he could protect me.

218
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:58,208
I never apologized.
Or even thanked him.

219
00:11:58,291 --> 00:12:02,625
Please tell me... He's not
gonna get hurt more, right?

220
00:12:02,708 --> 00:12:05,500
Don't worry. He
sustained those injuries

221
00:12:05,583 --> 00:12:07,875
because he has no
intention of dying.

222
00:12:07,958 --> 00:12:09,666
Though, as his teacher,
when this is over,

223
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:12,375
I'll have to scold him for
acting without my permission.

224
00:12:12,458 --> 00:12:14,458
[KOTA gasps]
Really?

225
00:12:14,541 --> 00:12:15,708
[AIZAWA]
Anyway.

226
00:12:15,791 --> 00:12:18,583
You'll get your chance
to talk to him again.

227
00:12:18,666 --> 00:12:20,125
And when you do,

228
00:12:20,208 --> 00:12:22,750
put more emphasis on
the "thank you" part.

229
00:12:24,125 --> 00:12:26,875
[MANDALAY]
Get back to camp right now!

230
00:12:26,958 --> 00:12:28,625
Those injuries aren't normal.

231
00:12:28,708 --> 00:12:30,833
[IZUKU]
I'm sorry. I can't!

232
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:32,750
You need to send one more thing.

233
00:12:32,833 --> 00:12:35,708
The villains. I know
one reason they're here.

234
00:12:35,791 --> 00:12:36,625
Huh?

235
00:12:36,708 --> 00:12:37,958
[IZUKU]
They're after Kacchan!

236
00:12:38,041 --> 00:12:39,500
Please, you have to let
the others know!

237
00:12:39,583 --> 00:12:41,083
Kacchan? Who's that?

238
00:12:41,166 --> 00:12:42,666
No! Wait! Stop!

239
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:44,791
[MAGNE] That rumble
in the ground earlier.

240
00:12:44,875 --> 00:12:48,250
Only two people in our group
fight with that kind of power.

241
00:12:48,333 --> 00:12:51,458
And sounds like
one of them talked.

242
00:12:51,541 --> 00:12:54,208
Could it possibly
have been Muscular?

243
00:12:54,291 --> 00:12:58,833
Don't tell me that little kid
is more powerful than him.

244
00:12:58,916 --> 00:13:00,000
In that case...

245
00:13:00,083 --> 00:13:01,916
This child must be put down!

246
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,791
[SPINNER]
Don't, Big Sis Mag.

247
00:13:03,875 --> 00:13:04,916
[MAGNE yelps]

248
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,833
What the hell was
that for, Spinner?

249
00:13:06,916 --> 00:13:08,958
He was on the
priority kill list!

250
00:13:09,041 --> 00:13:11,166
Shigaraki's the one
who wants him dead.

251
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:13,916
[MAGNE] Uh, yeah, and he's
the reason we're here.

252
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,916
[SPINNER] But that boy is
someone Stain wished to save.

253
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,416
Which means he was deemed worthy
of being called a true hero.

254
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,375
If Stain spared him, then--

255
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,166
About time I got a solid hit in.

256
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:28,333
[MANDALAY]
Can't stop the boy.

257
00:13:28,416 --> 00:13:31,250
But I can relay his message.

258
00:13:31,333 --> 00:13:32,291
[MANDALAY]
Listen, we've discovered

259
00:13:32,375 --> 00:13:34,083
one of the villains' targets.

260
00:13:34,166 --> 00:13:36,166
It's a student named Kacchan.

261
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:37,375
Bakugo?

262
00:13:37,458 --> 00:13:39,041
What do they want with him?

263
00:13:39,125 --> 00:13:41,500
[MANDALAY] Kacchan, you
should try to avoid combat.

264
00:13:41,583 --> 00:13:44,000
And to stick to a group.

265
00:13:44,083 --> 00:13:45,375
Aw, damn it!

266
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:47,291
[MANDALAY]
I hope you can hear me!

267
00:13:47,375 --> 00:13:50,125
I could focus if you
got out of my damn head!

268
00:13:50,208 --> 00:13:52,000
I can take care of myself!

269
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:55,708
Don't rush into
this fight carelessly!

270
00:13:57,458 --> 00:14:01,083
[MOONFISH] Have to keep
going... Have to work...

271
00:14:01,166 --> 00:14:03,166
Do my job...

272
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:04,958
[MOONFISH growls]

273
00:14:05,041 --> 00:14:06,791
Weren't you listening
to Mandalay?

274
00:14:06,875 --> 00:14:08,791
They're here because
they're after you.

275
00:14:08,875 --> 00:14:12,083
Telling us not to engage
and then changing their minds.

276
00:14:12,166 --> 00:14:15,458
I don't know how, but I get the
feeling this is Deku's fault.

277
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:17,625
[KATSUKI yells]

278
00:14:17,708 --> 00:14:20,041
Well, I don't care
what anyone says!

279
00:14:26,375 --> 00:14:27,791
Damn it.

280
00:14:27,875 --> 00:14:29,541
He's good at moving through
this terrain with his Quirk.

281
00:14:29,625 --> 00:14:33,208
This freak he looks like
a scrawny little sidekick to me!

282
00:14:33,291 --> 00:14:34,875
C'mon, ya bastard!

283
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:38,875
[TODOROKI] This clearly
isn't his first battle.

284
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:43,291
Show me... Show me
your exquisite flesh!

285
00:14:43,375 --> 00:14:46,291
We can't start fires around here
because the flames will spread!

286
00:14:46,375 --> 00:14:48,208
Everyone could die
if we aren't careful.

287
00:14:48,291 --> 00:14:49,583
Do you understand me?

288
00:14:49,666 --> 00:14:51,916
Yeah, I get it! I'm not stupid!

289
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,041
[TODOROKI]
Even if we try to retreat,

290
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:54,833
there's poison gas everywhere.

291
00:14:54,916 --> 00:14:58,541
They're obviously trying
to drive us into a corner.

292
00:14:58,625 --> 00:15:00,125
[TETSUTETSU]
Did you hear what she said?

293
00:15:00,208 --> 00:15:02,416
We've got permission
to punch people!

294
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:03,958
[KENDO]
Wait, Tetsutetsu!

295
00:15:04,041 --> 00:15:06,000
Do you understand
how this gas works?

296
00:15:06,083 --> 00:15:07,333
[TETSUTETSU]
Yeah, it's dangerous.

297
00:15:07,416 --> 00:15:08,750
Gimme some credit, Kendo.

298
00:15:08,833 --> 00:15:11,291
[KENDO] Listen! Mandalay
didn't say anything

299
00:15:11,375 --> 00:15:13,583
about the gas in her message.

300
00:15:13,666 --> 00:15:14,958
That means it must
not have spread

301
00:15:15,041 --> 00:15:17,208
to wherever she's
broadcasting from.

302
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:19,333
But that doesn't make any sense.

303
00:15:19,416 --> 00:15:21,416
This gas is moving
really slowly.

304
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:23,708
Normally it would
spread out more, right?

305
00:15:23,791 --> 00:15:26,875
This is staying in one place.
Not acting naturally.

306
00:15:26,958 --> 00:15:28,250
And look.

307
00:15:28,333 --> 00:15:30,041
It's definitely denser here
than it was in the area

308
00:15:30,125 --> 00:15:31,500
we just ran away from.

309
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:33,208
[TETSUTETSU]
Okay. So what?

310
00:15:33,291 --> 00:15:35,541
[KENDO] I think it's
swirling around one source.

311
00:15:35,625 --> 00:15:38,583
Somewhere near here.
Like a typhoon.

312
00:15:38,666 --> 00:15:40,166
If that's true,
there should be someone

313
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:42,583
who's producing the gas
at the center of the storm.

314
00:15:42,666 --> 00:15:44,041
A villain who's controlling it.

315
00:15:44,125 --> 00:15:46,666
[TETSUTETSU]
I get it now! Oh, man, Kendo.

316
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:48,208
You're so amazing!

317
00:15:48,291 --> 00:15:49,791
[KENDO]
I figured you'd miss the signs.

318
00:15:49,875 --> 00:15:52,791
That's why I came
with you. Okay.

319
00:15:52,875 --> 00:15:54,750
The closer we get to
the center of the swirl,

320
00:15:54,833 --> 00:15:57,708
the thicker the poison
will be. That's a problem.

321
00:15:57,791 --> 00:16:00,416
There's a limit to how much gas
these things can filter.

322
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:03,375
And the denser the gas, the
shorter the functioning time.

323
00:16:03,458 --> 00:16:04,708
That means...

324
00:16:04,791 --> 00:16:06,666
[TETSUTETSU] Ah! We run
head-first into the center

325
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:09,041
of the typhoon and
punch whoever's there!

326
00:16:09,125 --> 00:16:12,041
[KENDO groans]
Well, technically, yeah.

327
00:16:12,125 --> 00:16:15,666
[KENDO] He's a little one-note,
but he's not wrong.

328
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:17,333
[TETSUTETSU] Shiozaki and
our other classmates

329
00:16:17,416 --> 00:16:20,125
suffered because of this
villain's stupid power.

330
00:16:20,208 --> 00:16:23,208
Stuff like that
really pisses me off.

331
00:16:23,291 --> 00:16:25,833
Let's teach this bad guy
a lesson, Kendo!

332
00:16:25,916 --> 00:16:27,083
[KENDO]
Heh!

333
00:16:28,541 --> 00:16:30,916
[KENDO] I can't say I don't
like this side of you.

334
00:16:37,708 --> 00:16:39,500
[MUSTARD]
Three--no.

335
00:16:39,583 --> 00:16:41,875
Two people are headed
straight for me.

336
00:16:41,958 --> 00:16:43,791
I guess a few of them
avoided my gas

337
00:16:43,875 --> 00:16:45,250
and realized I'm here.

338
00:16:45,333 --> 00:16:48,666
I should have expected that
from a prestigious school.

339
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:49,916
But then...

340
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,333
No matter how wonderful
their Quirks may be...

341
00:16:52,416 --> 00:16:54,166
[TETSUTETSU]
I found you!

342
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:56,166
[MUSTARD]
...they're still only human.

343
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:00,250
[IZUKU]
That sounded like a gunshot.

344
00:17:00,333 --> 00:17:03,041
Kacchan, you better be okay!

345
00:17:03,125 --> 00:17:04,250
[MUSTARD]
Ah.

346
00:17:04,333 --> 00:17:07,125
I saw you on TV during
the sports festival.

347
00:17:07,208 --> 00:17:09,291
You can make your skin hard.

348
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:11,000
That means you're bulletproof.

349
00:17:11,083 --> 00:17:13,250
[TETSUTETSU grunts]

350
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:15,500
[MUSTARD]
Eh. That doesn't really matter.

351
00:17:15,583 --> 00:17:17,541
Because now, it's just
a matter of how long

352
00:17:17,625 --> 00:17:20,041
you can hold your breath
in this toxic miasma.

353
00:17:20,125 --> 00:17:22,166
[TETSUTETSU]
Seriously? He pulled a gun?

354
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:24,750
And he took out my
mask with one shot.

355
00:17:24,833 --> 00:17:26,541
What's this shorty's deal?

356
00:17:26,625 --> 00:17:29,333
And why is he wearing
a school uniform?

357
00:17:29,416 --> 00:17:31,166
He's probably my age.

358
00:17:32,416 --> 00:17:35,000
[MUSTARD] What, do you think
you're The Terminator?

359
00:17:35,083 --> 00:17:36,500
Even if you can steel yourself,

360
00:17:36,583 --> 00:17:38,791
charging straight
in is a fool's move.

361
00:17:38,875 --> 00:17:41,791
Shouldn't you be smarter
if you go to UA?

362
00:17:41,875 --> 00:17:44,916
Don't be so rash. Use your head.

363
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,041
[TETSUTETSU grunts]

364
00:17:46,125 --> 00:17:47,375

Or you're not worth killing.

It's no good. Retreat!

[MUSTARD laughs]

368
00:17:52,083 --> 00:17:53,208
[MUSTARD]
Two against one,

369
00:17:53,291 --> 00:17:55,375
and you were banking
on a surprise attack.

370
00:17:55,458 --> 00:17:58,208
What a simple plan.
I expected better.

371
00:17:58,291 --> 00:18:00,625
I'm producing and
controlling this gas, yes.

372
00:18:00,708 --> 00:18:02,125
But that's not all.

373
00:18:02,208 --> 00:18:03,833
The gas is showing me
your movements

374
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:05,500
with its fluctuations.

375
00:18:05,583 --> 00:18:08,500
In other words,
you can't hide from me.

376
00:18:08,583 --> 00:18:10,625
You arrogant UA students.

377
00:18:10,708 --> 00:18:12,708
Why didn't you figure
that out, huh?

378
00:18:12,791 --> 00:18:15,291
You're shattering the image
I had of your school.

379
00:18:15,375 --> 00:18:19,250
What a shame.

[MUSTARD]
What's this?

383
00:18:27,416 --> 00:18:29,583
You seem softer than
you were earlier.

384
00:18:29,666 --> 00:18:31,666
Let me guess,
maybe metal fatigue?

385
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:33,958
Or is it because you
can't breathe anymore?

386
00:18:34,041 --> 00:18:36,041
How many more
shots can you take?

do endurance tests

390
00:18:41,458 --> 00:18:44,250
for people like you who
have simple, one-note Quirks?

00:18:44,333 --> 00:18:48,125
And yet, you still rush in
like you're indestructible.

Hey.

You guys wanna grow up
to be heroes, right?

395
00:18:52,375 --> 00:18:55,666
Something about that
is so strange to me.

396
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:58,125
For people to fawn over
someone like you,

397
00:18:58,208 --> 00:19:03,291
a one-trick pony, just because
of where you went to school!

I can tell exactly how

you're moving thanks
to the flow of the gas.

[MUSTARD] I can't believe
you think you'll win

with that pitiful Quirk.

[KENDO]
Whether it's pitiful or not

411
00:19:35,875 --> 00:19:38,958
completely depends
on how I use it!

You're pathetic.

Carrying a gun around
in that dumb uniform

is basically saying you
know you can't win a fight

We were ambushed by villains,
and I covered us.
