[panting]

00:00:16.975 --> 00:00:20.937 position:50% align:center
[yells] To hell with
those damn Neuroi!

00:00:21.021 --> 00:00:22.355 position:50% align:center
That's how it goes, Jerry.

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:23.440 position:50% align:center
Calm down.

00:00:23.523 --> 00:00:25.400 position:50% align:center
Show some respect,
will ya, Bradley?

00:00:25.483 --> 00:00:28.153 position:50% align:center
I didn't drag my ass all
the way to Europe to sit back

00:00:28.236 --> 00:00:30.280 position:50% align:center
and not kick the crap
outta the Neuroi!

00:00:30.363 --> 00:00:32.866 position:50% align:center
Give me one solid reason
why I should be compliant

00:00:32.949 --> 00:00:35.660 position:50% align:center
in calling off
Operation Southwind?

00:00:37.495 --> 00:00:39.414 position:50% align:center
You damn well know
it isn't canceled.

00:00:39.497 --> 00:00:41.666 position:50% align:center
The idea is just
temporarily shelved.

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:43.168 position:50% align:center
Without Ahntwerpen,
how are we getting

00:00:43.251 --> 00:00:45.295 position:50% align:center
our men and supplies
to Berlin, huh?

00:00:45.378 --> 00:00:48.381 position:50% align:center
[growls] Bastards!

00:00:48.465 --> 00:00:51.134 position:50% align:center
--[gunshots]
--[sighs]

00:00:53.094 --> 00:00:54.346 position:50% align:center
[MECHANIC 302A]
Sure thing.

00:00:54.429 --> 00:00:56.056 position:50% align:center
So we'll send this back
to the Helvetia Air Force

00:00:56.139 --> 00:00:57.515 position:50% align:center
as requested, then.

00:00:57.599 --> 00:01:00.477 position:50% align:center
Okay! I really
appreciate it, mister!

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:03.480 position:50% align:center
[MECHANIC 302A] Nah.
There's no need to thank us.

00:01:03.563 --> 00:01:05.231 position:50% align:center
We didn't do much.

00:01:05.315 --> 00:01:06.733 position:50% align:center
I know there wasn't
a lot of time,

00:01:06.816 --> 00:01:09.736 position:50% align:center
but we really wish we could've
helped you more, somehow.

00:01:09.819 --> 00:01:11.988 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIKA] I made sure
to keep under 2,000 RPMs

00:01:12.072 --> 00:01:14.240 position:50% align:center
the whole time, too.

00:01:14.324 --> 00:01:16.493 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKA]
Miyafuji!

00:01:16.576 --> 00:01:18.703 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIKA]
Shizuka!

00:01:18.787 --> 00:01:20.038 position:50% align:center
Did you come to pick me up?

00:01:20.121 --> 00:01:21.456 position:50% align:center
Of course I did!

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:24.209 position:50% align:center
I can't let you walk there
all by yourself, can I?

00:01:24.292 --> 00:01:26.252 position:50% align:center
I'd love to go together!

00:01:26.336 --> 00:01:27.921 position:50% align:center
Let's head to the base, okay?

00:01:28.004 --> 00:01:30.382 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Great!

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:16.404 position:50% align:center
[MINNA] So, just to be clear,
the operation to retake Berlin

00:03:16.488 --> 00:03:19.532 position:50% align:center
has been placed on
an indefinite hiatus.

00:03:19.616 --> 00:03:21.785 position:50% align:center
Nevertheless, we'll remain
on the front lines

00:03:21.868 --> 00:03:23.661 position:50% align:center
until further instructed.

00:03:23.745 --> 00:03:24.954 position:50% align:center
And, Captain.

00:03:25.038 --> 00:03:27.040 position:50% align:center
I expect you to
maintain self-control,

00:03:27.123 --> 00:03:28.917 position:50% align:center
do I make myself clear?

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.752 position:50% align:center
You don't need to tell me that.

00:03:30.835 --> 00:03:32.087 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah?

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:34.005 position:50% align:center
That's funny, 'cause to me,
it kinda looked like

00:03:34.089 --> 00:03:36.758 position:50% align:center
you were ready to blast off
to Berlin all on your own.

00:03:36.841 --> 00:03:39.094 position:50% align:center
Wow! It's almost like
our sweet little Barkhorn

00:03:39.177 --> 00:03:40.512 position:50% align:center
has finally grown up!

00:03:40.595 --> 00:03:41.888 position:50% align:center
[giggles]

00:03:41.971 --> 00:03:43.765 position:50% align:center
That is enough.

00:03:43.848 --> 00:03:45.809 position:50% align:center
[laughs nervously]

00:03:45.892 --> 00:03:47.185 position:50% align:center
Now that we've touched on that,

00:03:47.268 --> 00:03:49.604 position:50% align:center
I'd like to introduce you
to our new recruit.

00:03:49.688 --> 00:03:51.481 position:50% align:center
You already met her
in Antwerpen,

00:03:51.564 --> 00:03:55.193 position:50% align:center
but her official assignment with
us will begin starting today.

00:03:55.276 --> 00:03:57.612 position:50% align:center
Deep breaths. Just relax.

00:03:57.696 --> 00:03:59.322 position:50% align:center
I still feel
a bit under-qualified

00:03:59.406 --> 00:04:02.534 position:50% align:center
to take a position
with the 501st.

00:04:02.617 --> 00:04:07.330 position:50% align:center
I want this, though.
I'd really like to fly with you!

00:04:08.623 --> 00:04:10.125 position:50% align:center
Miyafuji!

00:04:10.208 --> 00:04:11.960 position:50% align:center
[MINNA]
Hattori!

00:04:12.043 --> 00:04:14.295 position:50% align:center
Hattori, you may come in now!

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:15.714 position:50% align:center
O-Okay!

00:04:15.797 --> 00:04:17.632 position:50% align:center
Hello, every--

00:04:17.716 --> 00:04:20.051 position:50% align:center
[yelps]

00:04:24.305 --> 00:04:26.766 position:50% align:center
Ow, ow, ow...

00:04:31.688 --> 00:04:35.984 position:50% align:center
[SHIRLEY laughs]
Her cheeks are saluting the sky!

00:04:36.067 --> 00:04:38.403 position:50% align:center
[SHIRLEY] Man, you can't
make this stuff up!

00:04:38.486 --> 00:04:39.237 position:50% align:center
Please, Eila.

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:40.655 position:50% align:center
Quiet! We really shouldn't

00:04:40.739 --> 00:04:43.033 position:50% align:center
be mocking other
people's failures.

00:04:43.116 --> 00:04:45.493 position:50% align:center
Are you all right, Hattori?

00:04:45.577 --> 00:04:47.495 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIKA] Can you
stand up? Are you hurt?

00:04:47.579 --> 00:04:49.581 position:50% align:center
[laughing] Sorry, that was rich.

00:04:49.664 --> 00:04:51.583 position:50% align:center
Not everyday someone
comes in spread eagle!

00:04:51.666 --> 00:04:53.251 position:50% align:center
It was a heck of an entrance!

00:04:53.335 --> 00:04:55.670 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKA]
I'm ready to die now.

00:04:58.173 --> 00:04:59.549 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKA]
Miyafuji!

00:04:59.632 --> 00:05:02.218 position:50% align:center
Everybody makes
mistakes now and then.

00:05:04.346 --> 00:05:06.389 position:50% align:center
Try to cheer up!

00:05:06.473 --> 00:05:11.186 position:50% align:center
Welcome aboard the 501st!

00:05:11.269 --> 00:05:12.812 position:50% align:center
Thank you!

00:05:12.896 --> 00:05:15.315 position:50% align:center
It seems you've got somebody
that looks up to you.

00:05:15.398 --> 00:05:17.067 position:50% align:center
Please be sure
to take care of her.

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:18.568 position:50% align:center
Will do!

00:05:18.651 --> 00:05:22.322 position:50% align:center
It's not a bother?
It would mean so much.

00:05:28.495 --> 00:05:31.456 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKA] Are you going to show
me around the base, Lynette?

00:05:31.539 --> 00:05:33.667 position:50% align:center
Correct! Although,
I must apologize,

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:36.711 position:50% align:center
as I just got here myself,
so we'll be exploring together.

00:05:36.795 --> 00:05:38.588 position:50% align:center
Do you know what
the bath's like?

00:05:38.672 --> 00:05:41.216 position:50% align:center
Sure do! It's a
Fuso-styled one!

00:05:41.299 --> 00:05:42.592 position:50% align:center
Oh, nice!

00:05:42.676 --> 00:05:44.344 position:50% align:center
Wanna bathe together again?

00:05:44.427 --> 00:05:45.261 position:50% align:center
Let's!

00:05:45.345 --> 00:05:46.179 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIKA, LYNNE giggle]

00:05:46.262 --> 00:05:47.764 position:50% align:center
[LYNNE]
After the tour, then!

00:05:49.891 --> 00:05:51.810 position:50% align:center
[LYNNE]
This is the hangar!

00:06:01.945 --> 00:06:04.447 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIKA]
Look! It's my new unit!

00:06:04.531 --> 00:06:07.117 position:50% align:center
I-I have a Shiden Kai, too!

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:10.537 position:50% align:center
Y'don't say! Guess
we're a pair, then!

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:11.788 position:50% align:center
Yes!

00:06:20.588 --> 00:06:22.841 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:06:24.759 --> 00:06:27.053 position:50% align:center
[BOTH sigh]

00:06:30.306 --> 00:06:31.558 position:50% align:center
Uh!

00:06:40.567 --> 00:06:43.361 position:50% align:center
[LYNNE] You two must be
exhausted from all that walking.

00:06:43.445 --> 00:06:46.197 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIKA] This is all for us?
I say we dig in, then!

00:06:46.281 --> 00:06:48.074 position:50% align:center
Yes! It looks great.

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:52.746 position:50% align:center
Oh! Incredible.

00:06:52.829 --> 00:06:56.291 position:50% align:center
[muffled]

00:06:56.374 --> 00:06:57.542 position:50% align:center
If you like them that much,

00:06:57.625 --> 00:06:59.711 position:50% align:center
I'll just have to spoil
you with more. Here!

00:06:59.794 --> 00:07:01.338 position:50% align:center
Ah!

00:07:01.421 --> 00:07:03.548 position:50% align:center
[LYNNE, YOSHIKA giggling]

00:07:03.631 --> 00:07:04.799 position:50% align:center
[LYNNE]
Hattori!

00:07:04.883 --> 00:07:06.301 position:50% align:center
Did you have any
additional questions

00:07:06.384 --> 00:07:08.178 position:50% align:center
about the base or
anything like that?

00:07:08.261 --> 00:07:10.472 position:50% align:center
Uh! Not really! Think I'm good.

00:07:10.555 --> 00:07:12.349 position:50% align:center
Although, I guess
I'm a little bit surprised

00:07:12.432 --> 00:07:14.434 position:50% align:center
that I get to share
a room with Miyafuji!

00:07:14.517 --> 00:07:16.728 position:50% align:center
I couldn't believe it either!

00:07:16.811 --> 00:07:18.313 position:50% align:center
Speaking of which, it's funny.

00:07:18.396 --> 00:07:19.731 position:50% align:center
When I saw my new room,

00:07:19.814 --> 00:07:22.567 position:50% align:center
I felt like I was already
at home for some reason.

00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:23.818 position:50% align:center
I'm glad to hear that.

00:07:23.902 --> 00:07:25.862 position:50% align:center
I decorated the room
special for you.

00:07:25.945 --> 00:07:27.322 position:50% align:center
I wanted to match your tastes.

00:07:27.405 --> 00:07:29.783 position:50% align:center
[gasps] That explains a lot!

00:07:29.866 --> 00:07:32.285 position:50% align:center
The carpet's even
tatami-colored, too!

00:07:44.506 --> 00:07:47.801 position:50% align:center
What's wrong, Hattori?
You're a few seconds behind!

00:07:47.884 --> 00:07:50.178 position:50% align:center
My apologies,
Officer Clostermann!

00:07:50.261 --> 00:07:52.555 position:50% align:center
Major Sakamoto
recommended you, correct?

00:07:52.639 --> 00:07:55.266 position:50% align:center
Please don't tell me you're
trying to humiliate her.

00:07:55.350 --> 00:07:56.810 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:08:00.647 --> 00:08:02.482 position:50% align:center
You okay, Shizuka?

00:08:02.565 --> 00:08:03.733 position:50% align:center
I'm fine.

00:08:03.817 --> 00:08:05.985 position:50% align:center
Ya gotta shake it off!
Try not to be nervous!

00:08:06.069 --> 00:08:09.906 position:50% align:center
Now take a deep breath
and follow me, 'kay?

00:08:09.989 --> 00:08:11.116 position:50% align:center
Right!

00:08:15.704 --> 00:08:18.164 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIKA giggles]

00:08:19.582 --> 00:08:20.500 position:50% align:center
That's much better.

00:08:20.583 --> 00:08:22.711 position:50% align:center
Nice, Hattori!
Now you've got it!

00:08:22.794 --> 00:08:23.878 position:50% align:center
Thanks!

00:08:24.879 --> 00:08:26.131 position:50% align:center
[PERRINE]
All right!

00:08:26.214 --> 00:08:28.425 position:50% align:center
Let's break off into pairs
and have a mock battle!

00:08:33.763 --> 00:08:34.848 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:08:36.099 --> 00:08:37.934 position:50% align:center
You're leaving
your backside open!

00:08:38.018 --> 00:08:39.102 position:50% align:center
[yelps]

00:08:45.316 --> 00:08:46.317 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:08:46.401 --> 00:08:48.278 position:50% align:center
And where do you
think you're going?

00:08:49.779 --> 00:08:50.822 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:08:52.323 --> 00:08:53.324 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKA]
Miyafuji?

00:08:53.408 --> 00:08:55.326 position:50% align:center
She threw a barrier
from that far?

00:08:55.410 --> 00:08:56.161 position:50% align:center
Now fire!

00:08:56.244 --> 00:08:56.995 position:50% align:center
Right!

00:08:57.078 --> 00:08:59.205 position:50% align:center
[yells]

00:09:00.165 --> 00:09:01.332 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:09:03.710 --> 00:09:05.754 position:50% align:center
[PERRINE]
How did she get me?

00:09:05.837 --> 00:09:08.923 position:50% align:center
Ugh! Using a shield like
that is cheating! Jerk!

00:09:09.007 --> 00:09:10.800 position:50% align:center
Only someone with
Yoshika's level of magic

00:09:10.884 --> 00:09:12.010 position:50% align:center
could pull that trick off.

00:09:12.093 --> 00:09:12.886 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:09:12.969 --> 00:09:14.971 position:50% align:center
We make a good team, Shizuka!

00:09:15.055 --> 00:09:17.015 position:50% align:center
Agreed, Miyafuji!

00:09:17.098 --> 00:09:19.059 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKA] I can't believe
I'm flying here with her!

00:09:19.142 --> 00:09:20.977 position:50% align:center
I have to do my best to keep up!

00:09:21.061 --> 00:09:23.813 position:50% align:center
I want to stay in the 501st,
right beside her!

00:09:23.897 --> 00:09:26.191 position:50% align:center
[engine sputtering]

00:09:27.901 --> 00:09:29.861 position:50% align:center
[screams]

is magic pressure?

To explain it in simple terms,

00:10:58.116 --> 00:11:00.285 position:50% align:center
Flying Officers such as us
have a lot to juggle

00:11:00.368 --> 00:11:02.829 position:50% align:center

our magic between flying,

our shields, and
offensive techniques.

00:11:05.373 --> 00:11:07.083 position:50% align:center
Well, it's magic pressure
that allows us

to finetune and control
these abilities.

00:11:09.461 --> 00:11:11.004 position:50% align:center

00:11:16.509 --> 00:11:18.511 position:50% align:center
Her magic is like
a broken faucet.

00:11:18.595 --> 00:11:19.846 position:50% align:center
It's completely unstable,

00:11:19.929 --> 00:11:22.223 position:50% align:center
so sometimes it works,
and sometimes it doesn't.

00:11:22.307 --> 00:11:24.225 position:50% align:center

half its efficiency.

So if I understand correctly,
she's been able to get by

for her to fight, right?

They're speculating that
her magical pressure loss

00:11:48.667 --> 00:11:49.959 position:50% align:center
is due to a catalyst.

00:17:50.820 --> 00:17:52.155 position:50% align:center
[MINNA]
There's what?

00:17:52.238 --> 00:17:53.281 position:50% align:center
[MAN 303A]
The Neuroi most likely

00:17:53.365 --> 00:17:55.533 position:50% align:center
split into three, not two!

00:17:55.617 --> 00:17:57.702 position:50% align:center
[MAN 303B] One covertly
approached at low altitude

00:17:57.786 --> 00:18:00.288 position:50% align:center
to avoid being
detected by our radar.

00:18:00.372 --> 00:18:03.041 position:50% align:center
They pulled that off? [gasps]

00:18:03.124 --> 00:18:04.334 position:50% align:center
The pair that came from the sea

00:18:04.417 --> 00:18:06.961 position:50% align:center
must have been a trap
to split the Witches.

00:18:07.045 --> 00:18:09.255 position:50% align:center
The real threat's still inbound!

00:18:10.882 --> 00:18:13.134 position:50% align:center
I'm going to help.
I need the both of you to--

00:18:13.218 --> 00:18:15.428 position:50% align:center
I volunteer myself to go up!

00:18:15.512 --> 00:18:16.721 position:50% align:center
But, Miyafuji!

00:18:16.805 --> 00:18:18.181 position:50% align:center
Denied.

00:18:18.264 --> 00:18:20.392 position:50% align:center
You're barely half a Witch
without your magic pressure.

00:18:20.475 --> 00:18:22.560 position:50% align:center
I refuse to send
you into combat.

00:18:22.644 --> 00:18:25.021 position:50% align:center
It would be utterly reckless.

00:18:25.105 --> 00:18:27.023 position:50% align:center
Am I that useless?

00:18:28.817 --> 00:18:30.485 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKA]
Isn't Miyafuji scared?

00:18:30.568 --> 00:18:32.654 position:50% align:center
She doesn't even know
if she can fly!

00:18:32.737 --> 00:18:34.072 position:50% align:center
And yet...

00:18:34.155 --> 00:18:34.989 position:50% align:center
You have to let me

00:18:35.073 --> 00:18:36.366 position:50% align:center
help protect the
base, Commander!

00:18:36.449 --> 00:18:37.701 position:50% align:center
I am begging you!

00:18:37.784 --> 00:18:38.993 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKA gasps]

00:18:39.077 --> 00:18:40.203 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKA]
That's right!

00:18:40.286 --> 00:18:43.081 position:50% align:center
Miyafuji always puts
her life on the line.

00:18:43.164 --> 00:18:46.835 position:50% align:center
She always gives it her all,
no matter what.

00:18:46.918 --> 00:18:50.672 position:50% align:center
Then there's me.
I only care about myself.

00:18:50.755 --> 00:18:52.674 position:50% align:center
I wasn't thinking about my duty.

00:18:52.757 --> 00:18:56.594 position:50% align:center
I was only thinking about
being together with her.

00:18:56.678 --> 00:18:58.013 position:50% align:center
I request to go up as well!

00:18:58.096 --> 00:18:58.888 position:50% align:center
Seriously?

00:18:58.972 --> 00:19:00.849 position:50% align:center
I'm barely half a Witch myself.

00:19:00.932 --> 00:19:05.061 position:50% align:center
However... I can still help!
I can do something!

00:19:06.646 --> 00:19:08.189 position:50% align:center
Huh? Miyafuji.

00:19:08.273 --> 00:19:10.442 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIKA]
Shizuka. Let's both go!

00:19:10.525 --> 00:19:11.526 position:50% align:center
We're two half Witches,

00:19:11.609 --> 00:19:14.738 position:50% align:center
but together, that's a whole!

00:19:14.821 --> 00:19:16.156 position:50% align:center
Agreed!

00:19:16.239 --> 00:19:19.784 position:50% align:center
If we're side by side,
we can do whatever must be done!

00:19:22.245 --> 00:19:24.164 position:50% align:center
[sighs] All right.

00:19:34.507 --> 00:19:37.177 position:50% align:center
I'm not giving you
another inch.

00:19:43.475 --> 00:19:44.934 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:19:48.063 --> 00:19:49.230 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:19:51.566 --> 00:19:52.567 position:50% align:center
You're up next!

00:19:55.070 --> 00:19:57.155 position:50% align:center
I may not be stable yet.

00:19:57.238 --> 00:20:00.033 position:50% align:center
But together, we're more
than strong enough!

00:20:03.411 --> 00:20:05.538 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKA] I'm only going
to focus on carrying you!

00:20:05.622 --> 00:20:08.249 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIKA] And you can count me
to throw up the shields!

00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:18.259 position:50% align:center
The core is exposed!

00:20:18.343 --> 00:20:19.177 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIKA]
Shizuka!

00:20:19.260 --> 00:20:20.345 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKA]
On it!

00:20:32.524 --> 00:20:34.818 position:50% align:center
Just keep covering me, okay?

00:20:34.901 --> 00:20:36.986 position:50% align:center
Now, fire!

00:20:37.070 --> 00:20:39.447 position:50% align:center
With you, I have
nothing to fear!

00:20:50.750 --> 00:20:52.335 position:50% align:center
[WITCHES gasp]

00:20:52.419 --> 00:20:53.753 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:20:55.755 --> 00:20:57.173 position:50% align:center
Hang on? Suicide?

00:20:57.257 --> 00:20:58.925 position:50% align:center
No. Someone else must have found

00:20:59.009 --> 00:21:01.928 position:50% align:center
the core and
destroyed it just now.

00:21:02.012 --> 00:21:05.807 position:50% align:center
That was so amazing, Shizuka.
Even if we're not perfect,

00:21:05.890 --> 00:21:08.727 position:50% align:center
we make one great Witch
when we work together.

00:21:08.810 --> 00:21:09.978 position:50% align:center
It's funny.

00:21:10.061 --> 00:21:12.605 position:50% align:center
Lynne and I were in a
similar situation once.

00:21:12.689 --> 00:21:14.691 position:50% align:center
You and Lynnette were?

00:21:19.821 --> 00:21:23.366 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIKA] I need to work harder
so I can fly alone again.

00:21:23.450 --> 00:21:27.078 position:50% align:center
Honestly, having you support me
isn't all that bad, though.

00:21:27.162 --> 00:21:28.580 position:50% align:center
Plus, I have to admit,

00:21:28.663 --> 00:21:31.875 position:50% align:center
it's a really nice feeling
knowing you're right behind me.

00:21:31.958 --> 00:21:33.501 position:50% align:center
Uh, yeah?

00:21:38.631 --> 00:21:39.883 position:50% align:center
Training starts now!

00:21:39.966 --> 00:21:41.134 position:50% align:center
We're gonna get you
back in the sky

00:21:41.217 --> 00:21:42.886 position:50% align:center
as soon as possible, got it?

00:21:42.969 --> 00:21:44.512 position:50% align:center
As your superior,
that's an order!

00:21:44.596 --> 00:21:46.473 position:50% align:center
Hang on a second, Shizuka.

00:21:46.556 --> 00:21:48.808 position:50% align:center
I thought we were
both pilot officers.

00:21:48.892 --> 00:21:51.269 position:50% align:center
You're forgetting,
that's your rank as a medic!

00:21:51.353 --> 00:21:53.313 position:50% align:center
In the 501st, you're a sergeant!

00:21:53.396 --> 00:21:54.856 position:50% align:center
Aw! Since when!

00:21:54.939 --> 00:21:57.859 position:50% align:center
Why didn't anybody
tell me that? Huh?

00:21:59.194 --> 00:22:01.654 position:50% align:center
Looks like it's going
to be a rough road.

00:23:35.457 --> 00:23:36.833 position:50% align:center
[SHIRLEY]
They got me!

00:23:36.916 --> 00:23:37.834 position:50% align:center
[FRANCESCA]
Wait, what?

00:23:37.917 --> 00:23:39.419 position:50% align:center
[SHIRLEY]
My record was broken!

00:23:39.502 --> 00:23:41.546 position:50% align:center
[FRANCESCA]
Let's do this, Shirley! Modify!

00:23:41.629 --> 00:23:42.756 position:50% align:center
[BARKHORN]
Stop messing around!

00:23:42.839 --> 00:23:44.090 position:50% align:center
There's work to be done!

00:23:44.174 --> 00:23:45.425 position:50% align:center
[SHIRLEY]
On the next <i>Strike Witches</i> :

00:23:45.508 --> 00:23:47.427 position:50% align:center
"Beyond Two Hundred
Miles Per Hour"!

00:23:47.510 --> 00:23:49.846 position:50% align:center
I'll be the fastest
person on Earth!
