[MINNA] We can't get
through to anyone inside.

00:00:13.722 --> 00:00:15.682 position:50% align:center
The Ratte is on its own.

00:00:17.809 --> 00:00:19.936 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIKA] You think we can use
that building over there?

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:21.521 position:50% align:center
What?

00:00:21.604 --> 00:00:22.981 position:50% align:center
The flak tower?

00:02:01.246 --> 00:02:02.330 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIERS groaning]

00:02:02.414 --> 00:02:04.207 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIKA]
I set the bone back in place!

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.710 position:50% align:center
Now just apply firm pressure
to stop the bleeding!

00:02:06.793 --> 00:02:07.544 position:50% align:center
[PATTON]
Dammit!

00:02:07.627 --> 00:02:09.087 position:50% align:center
It's not over yet.

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:11.131 position:50% align:center
I still got some
kick left in me!

00:02:11.214 --> 00:02:12.966 position:50% align:center
[ALL yelp]

00:02:20.765 --> 00:02:22.183 position:50% align:center
What was that
explosion just now?

00:02:22.267 --> 00:02:23.351 position:50% align:center
A direct hit?

00:02:23.435 --> 00:02:25.145 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIER 312AA]
The ceiling's collapsing!

[ALL yelping]

00:02:29.357 --> 00:02:31.192 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIER 312B] The active Witch
units are accomplishing

00:02:31.276 --> 00:02:32.694 position:50% align:center
their designated objectives.

00:02:32.777 --> 00:02:35.447 position:50% align:center
However, the 502nd is
struggling with the enemy

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:37.157 position:50% align:center
to the front of the convoy.

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:39.034 position:50% align:center
And what about
our situation here?

00:02:39.117 --> 00:02:41.995 position:50% align:center
We're using tunnels, sir.
They're located under Berlin.

00:02:42.078 --> 00:02:44.164 position:50% align:center
The 501st is headed there now.

00:02:44.247 --> 00:02:46.291 position:50% align:center
They're breaching the dome?

00:02:46.374 --> 00:02:47.375 position:50% align:center
[HARTMANN]
I'm surprised you knew

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:49.669 position:50% align:center
Berlin had these
subterranean passages.

00:02:49.753 --> 00:02:52.172 position:50% align:center
Yeah, well, Chris had a
serious passion for subways,

00:02:52.255 --> 00:02:54.883 position:50% align:center
so I wound up learning
quite a bit in passing.

00:02:54.966 --> 00:02:56.634 position:50% align:center
All thanks to your sister, huh?

00:02:56.718 --> 00:02:58.261 position:50% align:center
Uh-huh.

00:02:58.345 --> 00:03:00.347 position:50% align:center
Hey! Over there!

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:02.307 position:50% align:center
That's an entrance
to the tunnels!

00:03:05.018 --> 00:03:06.478 position:50% align:center
[yelps]

00:03:07.479 --> 00:03:08.605 position:50% align:center
Is something wrong?

00:03:08.688 --> 00:03:09.814 position:50% align:center
Your equipment!

00:03:09.898 --> 00:03:12.984 position:50% align:center
Did you take damage from
that Neuroi barrier?

00:03:13.068 --> 00:03:14.819 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKA]
I don't think so.

00:03:14.903 --> 00:03:16.071 position:50% align:center
Are you sure?

00:03:16.154 --> 00:03:18.448 position:50% align:center
Sorry to say, but you'll
need to stay back here.

00:03:18.531 --> 00:03:21.034 position:50% align:center
Just wait a second!
I can still keep flying!

00:03:21.117 --> 00:03:22.827 position:50% align:center
I can fight like anybody else.

00:03:22.911 --> 00:03:24.788 position:50% align:center
Not with that damaged
Unit, you can't.

00:03:24.871 --> 00:03:26.581 position:50% align:center
You're going to have
difficulty navigating

00:03:26.664 --> 00:03:27.791 position:50% align:center
through the narrow tunnels.

00:03:27.874 --> 00:03:29.542 position:50% align:center
But I need to help Miyafuji!

00:03:29.626 --> 00:03:31.795 position:50% align:center
Enough, Hattori.
This is an order.

00:03:31.878 --> 00:03:35.465 position:50% align:center
[gasps] An order?

00:03:35.548 --> 00:03:38.093 position:50% align:center
Fine, then. Roger that.

00:03:38.176 --> 00:03:39.344 position:50% align:center
[BARKHORN]
Let's hurry.

00:03:48.895 --> 00:03:51.815 position:50% align:center
[BRADLEY] Rescue team, does your
wireless work in the tunnels?

00:03:51.898 --> 00:03:54.651 position:50% align:center
That's an affirmative, sir.
We hear you clearly.

00:03:54.734 --> 00:03:56.152 position:50% align:center
Nicely done, Sanya!

00:03:56.236 --> 00:03:58.738 position:50% align:center
We'll now enter line C
from Stadtmitte.

00:03:58.822 --> 00:04:00.323 position:50% align:center
It's getting way too tight!

00:04:00.407 --> 00:04:02.575 position:50% align:center
Just don't hit your head
on the ceiling!

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:08.790 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Oh, no!

00:04:08.873 --> 00:04:11.209 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:04:11.292 --> 00:04:12.627 position:50% align:center
[PERRINE]
The ceiling caved in.

00:04:12.711 --> 00:04:13.628 position:50% align:center
It's a dead end.

00:04:13.712 --> 00:04:15.755 position:50% align:center
[EILA]
Just our luck.

00:04:15.839 --> 00:04:17.882 position:50% align:center
And we were so close.

00:04:17.966 --> 00:04:19.426 position:50% align:center
[SHIRLEY]
Hey!

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:20.927 position:50% align:center
Let's see where this door leads!

00:04:21.011 --> 00:04:22.637 position:50% align:center
[BARKHORN]
What? Move!

00:04:27.892 --> 00:04:30.520 position:50% align:center
A shelter. It's for air raids?

00:04:30.603 --> 00:04:32.814 position:50% align:center
Then it should be connected
to the line ahead of us.

00:04:32.897 --> 00:04:35.108 position:50% align:center
I'm surprised that
there's one down here!

00:04:35.191 --> 00:04:37.318 position:50% align:center
It is Karlsland
we're talking about!

00:04:37.402 --> 00:04:39.195 position:50% align:center
Let's go!

00:04:39.279 --> 00:04:40.822 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIER 312BB]
Hurry! He's hurt!

00:04:40.905 --> 00:04:43.825 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIER 312CC]
We need you over here!

00:04:43.908 --> 00:04:47.412 position:50% align:center
Backup's on the way!
Just hang in there!

00:04:47.495 --> 00:04:48.621 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIER 312E]
Damn it!

00:04:48.705 --> 00:04:50.790 position:50% align:center
Why aren't we better
equipped to help them?

00:04:54.919 --> 00:04:57.047 position:50% align:center
I wish I could be there
for you, Miyafuji.

00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:59.382 position:50% align:center
[plane motor whirs]

00:04:59.466 --> 00:05:01.801 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKA]
What is a B-17 doing here?

00:05:01.885 --> 00:05:03.928 position:50% align:center
Hattori? Is that you?

00:05:04.012 --> 00:05:06.014 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Major Sakamoto!

00:05:06.097 --> 00:05:09.642 position:50% align:center
Her flying is unstable.
Her unit must have taken damage.

00:05:09.726 --> 00:05:12.562 position:50% align:center
Get the hatch open.
Let's pull her in here!

00:05:16.066 --> 00:05:18.735 position:50% align:center
[SAKAMOTO] So the other Witches
are currently underground?

00:05:18.818 --> 00:05:20.612 position:50% align:center
Correct. They're attempting
to make their way

00:05:20.695 --> 00:05:22.906 position:50% align:center
into the dome using
an indirect approach.

00:05:22.989 --> 00:05:24.574 position:50% align:center
I see now.

00:05:24.657 --> 00:05:26.993 position:50% align:center
That's quite an
impressive strategy.

00:05:27.077 --> 00:05:28.161 position:50% align:center
Well, in that event,

00:05:28.244 --> 00:05:30.372 position:50% align:center
let's drop the anti-Neuroi
fuel air bombs.

00:05:30.455 --> 00:05:31.748 position:50% align:center
Understood.

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:35.585 position:50% align:center
Keep pressing directly
on that wound.

00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:37.504 position:50% align:center
Anyone else need help here?

00:05:37.587 --> 00:05:39.756 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIER 312F]
Sergeant Miyafuji.

00:05:39.839 --> 00:05:41.591 position:50% align:center
There're still a few men
who went to the roof

00:05:41.675 --> 00:05:42.842 position:50% align:center
that haven't returned yet.

00:05:42.926 --> 00:05:44.803 position:50% align:center
They didn't? Why not?

00:05:44.886 --> 00:05:48.223 position:50% align:center
[yelling] I'm taking
you out with me!

00:05:48.306 --> 00:05:49.683 position:50% align:center
Eat this!

00:05:51.935 --> 00:05:54.104 position:50% align:center
Get back!

00:05:54.187 --> 00:05:56.189 position:50% align:center
Let go! Just let me die here!

00:05:56.272 --> 00:05:57.607 position:50% align:center
I refuse!

[SOLDIER 312G]
Why didn't you run away?

00:06:12.706 --> 00:06:15.709 position:50% align:center
There's no point in
helping me. Save yourself.

00:06:15.792 --> 00:06:17.293 position:50% align:center
Don't be silly.

00:06:17.377 --> 00:06:19.587 position:50% align:center
It's my responsibility
to help you.

00:06:19.671 --> 00:06:21.256 position:50% align:center

00:06:24.259 --> 00:06:25.760 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIKA]
Those are explosions!

00:06:25.844 --> 00:06:27.679 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIER 312G] Are they
trying to break the dome?

00:06:31.266 --> 00:06:32.767 position:50% align:center
We haven't made a dent yet.

00:06:32.851 --> 00:06:34.728 position:50% align:center
They're blowing up too soon.

00:06:34.811 --> 00:06:36.312 position:50% align:center
It's unfortunate,
but the delay timer

00:06:36.396 --> 00:06:37.814 position:50% align:center
is turned off on them.

00:06:37.897 --> 00:06:40.150 position:50% align:center
Would it be possible
to adjust it somehow?

00:06:40.233 --> 00:06:41.985 position:50% align:center
Not here, I'm afraid.

00:06:42.068 --> 00:06:44.279 position:50% align:center
We only have one bomb remaining.

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:53.788 position:50% align:center
[gasps] I can sense space
on the other side of that wall.

00:06:53.872 --> 00:06:54.914 position:50% align:center

Roger!

00:07:01.296 --> 00:07:03.131 position:50% align:center
What the...?

00:07:03.214 --> 00:07:04.007 position:50% align:center
[MINNA]
Where are we?

00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:05.842 position:50% align:center
I don't think it's a subway.

00:07:05.925 --> 00:07:07.010 position:50% align:center
It is a cave?

00:07:07.093 --> 00:07:08.845 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Look there!

00:07:15.894 --> 00:07:16.811 position:50% align:center
[BARKHORN]
No way!

00:07:16.895 --> 00:07:18.938 position:50% align:center
The World Capital Germania?

00:07:19.022 --> 00:07:19.981 position:50% align:center
I don't get it.

00:07:20.065 --> 00:07:21.316 position:50% align:center
A city.

00:07:21.399 --> 00:07:23.193 position:50% align:center
One that was planned by
a former Karlsland Emperor

00:07:23.276 --> 00:07:24.694 position:50% align:center
who was forced to step down.

00:07:24.778 --> 00:07:27.238 position:50% align:center
[HARTMANN] It never got outside
the planning stage though!

00:07:27.322 --> 00:07:28.948 position:50% align:center
[BARKHORN]
What's it doing underground?

00:07:29.032 --> 00:07:29.991 position:50% align:center
I dunno.

00:07:30.075 --> 00:07:31.701 position:50% align:center
I guess they must've
completed it.

00:07:31.785 --> 00:07:33.828 position:50% align:center
Who is "they?"

00:07:33.912 --> 00:07:35.914 position:50% align:center
Gah! Neuroi!

Sanya, look, look!

00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:39.125 position:50% align:center
Yes, I'm looking!

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:41.503 position:50% align:center
[MINNA]
Break!

00:08:12.909 --> 00:08:14.619 position:50% align:center
There're too many for us!

00:08:14.703 --> 00:08:16.162 position:50% align:center
[HARTMANN]
See that glowing building?

00:08:16.246 --> 00:08:18.790 position:50% align:center
Ya don't s'ppose that thing's
in the original plan?

00:08:18.873 --> 00:08:21.501 position:50% align:center
Nah. Germania didn't
have that tech.

00:08:21.584 --> 00:08:24.129 position:50% align:center
Everyone! Focus your fire
on that structure!

00:08:24.212 --> 00:08:25.547 position:50% align:center
[WITCHES]
Understood!

00:08:43.898 --> 00:08:47.527 position:50% align:center
Explosions? What's
happening to the Neuroi?

00:08:49.237 --> 00:08:51.114 position:50% align:center
Where could they
all be heading to?

00:08:53.199 --> 00:08:55.535 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIKA]
I can see the sky again!

00:08:55.618 --> 00:08:57.829 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKA]
Look! The walls changed!

00:08:57.912 --> 00:08:59.956 position:50% align:center
How strange.
The dome got thinner.

00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:03.001 position:50% align:center
Come on. What is
happening here?

00:09:20.143 --> 00:09:23.104 position:50% align:center
Dammit. It's regenerating!

00:09:23.188 --> 00:09:24.314 position:50% align:center
Commander Minna,

00:09:24.397 --> 00:09:26.107 position:50% align:center
there's an incoming
message from the Major!

00:09:26.191 --> 00:09:27.525 position:50% align:center

00:09:29.277 --> 00:09:30.111 position:50% align:center

[screams]

00:09:31.488 --> 00:09:33.198 position:50% align:center
[SAKAMOTO] Externally,
we noticed that the dome

00:09:33.281 --> 00:09:35.867 position:50% align:center
weakened for a moment.
What's happening in there?

00:09:35.950 --> 00:09:38.411 position:50% align:center
It did what? Could it be that...

00:09:38.495 --> 00:09:40.080 position:50% align:center
...our attack's working?

00:09:40.163 --> 00:09:41.956 position:50% align:center
Ensign Lucchini
and Officer Juutilainen,

00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:43.583 position:50% align:center
we need you to join
in on the assault!

00:09:43.667 --> 00:09:46.252 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Look at that.

00:09:46.336 --> 00:09:47.754 position:50% align:center
It's thinning out again.

00:09:47.837 --> 00:09:48.797 position:50% align:center
That settles it!

00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:50.048 position:50% align:center
Keep up the firepower!

00:09:50.131 --> 00:09:52.300 position:50% align:center
Whatever you're attacking
controls the dome!

00:09:52.384 --> 00:09:53.677 position:50% align:center
[PERRINE] You think
it'll affect the surface

00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:55.595 position:50% align:center
if we can destroy it?

00:09:55.679 --> 00:09:56.930 position:50% align:center
It's worth a shot, isn't it?

00:09:57.013 --> 00:09:58.598 position:50% align:center
Give it all you've got!

00:09:58.682 --> 00:09:59.849 position:50% align:center
[WITCHES]
Roger!

00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:06.898 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIER 312G]
Thank you, Miyafuji.

00:10:11.111 --> 00:10:13.613 position:50% align:center
General! It's too dangerous!

00:10:13.697 --> 00:10:18.076 position:50% align:center
Y'should take a look at this.
The Neuroi disappeared.

00:10:18.159 --> 00:10:20.704 position:50% align:center
Really? Where'd they go?

00:10:20.787 --> 00:10:22.372 position:50% align:center
Your fellow Witches are
hittin' 'em right where

00:10:22.455 --> 00:10:24.541 position:50% align:center
it hurts, so they're
startin' to pull back.

00:10:24.624 --> 00:10:25.625 position:50% align:center
They are?

00:10:25.709 --> 00:10:27.252 position:50% align:center
[PATTON]
Yeah. Seems like they're runnin'

00:10:27.335 --> 00:10:31.548 position:50% align:center
a team effort both above
ground and below.

00:10:31.631 --> 00:10:34.384 position:50% align:center
Everyone...

00:10:34.467 --> 00:10:35.260 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKA]
Look, Major!

00:10:35.343 --> 00:10:36.761 position:50% align:center
The dome is even thinner!

00:10:36.845 --> 00:10:38.096 position:50% align:center
Very good.

00:10:38.179 --> 00:10:40.098 position:50% align:center
I think it's time for us
to use our air bomb, then.

00:10:40.181 --> 00:10:42.809 position:50% align:center
Agreed, but we need to
ensure it detonates before

00:10:42.892 --> 00:10:44.894 position:50% align:center
it touches the dome,
or it's all over.

00:10:44.978 --> 00:10:46.229 position:50% align:center
I'm well aware!

00:10:46.312 --> 00:10:48.148 position:50% align:center
So, if you have any
suggestions, I'll hear them!

00:10:48.231 --> 00:10:49.816 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKA]
Allow me.

00:10:49.899 --> 00:10:51.609 position:50% align:center
I can detonate the bomb.

00:10:51.693 --> 00:10:52.777 position:50% align:center
But how?

00:10:52.861 --> 00:10:54.904 position:50% align:center
I'll take it down
to the barrier myself.

00:10:54.988 --> 00:10:57.198 position:50% align:center
And then I'll set the
bomb off by shooting it.

00:10:57.282 --> 00:10:58.616 position:50% align:center
That should do it.

00:10:58.700 --> 00:11:00.452 position:50% align:center
I don't think you
could pull that off.

00:11:00.535 --> 00:11:01.745 position:50% align:center
I'm afraid I agree.

00:11:01.828 --> 00:11:05.123 position:50% align:center
Your Striker Unit can
barely fly right now.

00:11:05.206 --> 00:11:07.334 position:50% align:center
That's true,
but I have an idea.

00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:13.089 position:50% align:center
[HARTMANN yells]

00:11:13.173 --> 00:11:16.092 position:50% align:center
[yelling]

00:11:20.013 --> 00:11:21.598 position:50% align:center
[PATTON]
A B-17?

00:11:21.681 --> 00:11:23.516 position:50% align:center
What're they gonna do with one?

00:11:26.936 --> 00:11:28.146 position:50% align:center
Release it!

00:11:31.524 --> 00:11:32.942 position:50% align:center
[PATTON]
They dropped a bomb!

00:11:33.026 --> 00:11:36.112 position:50% align:center
[gasps] And a Witch! But who?

00:11:37.155 --> 00:11:40.367 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKA] Please, Shinden!
Give me your power!

00:11:44.579 --> 00:11:46.998 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKA] It's draining
my magic so quickly!

00:11:47.082 --> 00:11:49.459 position:50% align:center
It hurts to breathe!

00:11:49.542 --> 00:11:51.961 position:50% align:center
Is this really what
Miyafuji fought with?

00:11:54.214 --> 00:11:57.300 position:50% align:center
It can't be! Shizuka!

00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:01.846 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKA]
Now!

00:12:08.228 --> 00:12:09.312 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKA screams]

00:12:09.396 --> 00:12:10.689 position:50% align:center
Shizuka!

00:12:15.735 --> 00:12:17.112 position:50% align:center
[PATTON]
She did it!

00:12:17.195 --> 00:12:19.698 position:50% align:center
She blasted a hole straight
through the barrier!

00:12:19.781 --> 00:12:23.410 position:50% align:center
Go back, Shizuka!
It's too dangerous!

00:12:23.493 --> 00:12:26.496 position:50% align:center
[PATTON] Now we can
send in a rescue team.

00:12:26.579 --> 00:12:28.707 position:50% align:center
[gasps] It's closing?

00:12:28.790 --> 00:12:30.333 position:50% align:center
Why is it sealing back up?

00:12:30.417 --> 00:12:32.836 position:50% align:center
The bomb detonated at
the perfect time, too!

00:12:32.919 --> 00:12:34.212 position:50% align:center
God damn it!

00:12:34.295 --> 00:12:35.463 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:12:38.883 --> 00:12:41.011 position:50% align:center
Miyafuji!

00:12:41.094 --> 00:12:43.054 position:50% align:center
[SAKAMOTO]
Hattori, get back here!

00:12:43.138 --> 00:12:44.514 position:50% align:center
But, Major! I can see her!

00:12:44.597 --> 00:12:46.057 position:50% align:center
[SAKAMOTO]
Stop!

00:12:46.141 --> 00:12:47.976 position:50% align:center
You don't have enough magic
power left to use the Shinden!

00:12:48.059 --> 00:12:50.520 position:50% align:center
Return to the plane!
That's an order!

00:12:54.899 --> 00:12:56.109 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:12:59.904 --> 00:13:01.906 position:50% align:center
No! Those bastards are back!

00:13:01.990 --> 00:13:03.783 position:50% align:center
Run! Take cover!

00:13:03.867 --> 00:13:06.244 position:50% align:center
You first, General!
I'll watch your back!

00:13:06.327 --> 00:13:07.495 position:50% align:center
What?

00:13:08.621 --> 00:13:10.081 position:50% align:center
Over here!

00:13:10.165 --> 00:13:12.625 position:50% align:center
[yells]

00:13:12.709 --> 00:13:14.419 position:50% align:center

00:13:14.502 --> 00:13:15.545 position:50% align:center
[SAKAMOTO]
Hattori, don't!

00:13:15.628 --> 00:13:17.756 position:50% align:center
You'll get locked
in there with them!

00:13:19.466 --> 00:13:20.842 position:50% align:center
[SAKAMOTO]
Hattori, that's an order!

00:13:20.925 --> 00:13:22.344 position:50% align:center
Get back here!

00:13:24.095 --> 00:13:27.223 position:50% align:center

00:13:35.899 --> 00:13:37.192 position:50% align:center

She's injured. And that's
a lot of blood.

I can't stop the bleeding.

00:14:35.458 --> 00:14:37.877 position:50% align:center

00:14:42.257 --> 00:14:46.594 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIKA] Please, magic!
You have to work! Please!

00:14:52.267 --> 00:14:58.148 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIKA] Why? Why isn't
it doing anything? Why?

to protect you.

[SHIZUKA]
But I did it, didn't I?

00:15:20.587 --> 00:15:22.839 position:50% align:center
Yes, you did.

00:15:22.922 --> 00:15:28.762 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKA]
I'm... so happy, Miyafuji.

00:15:31.931 --> 00:15:34.059 position:50% align:center
Shizuka! Come on!

00:15:34.142 --> 00:15:36.811 position:50% align:center
Talk to me! Hang in there!

00:15:44.027 --> 00:15:45.779 position:50% align:center
Shizuka.

[URSULA]
What's that light?

00:15:55.747 --> 00:15:57.165 position:50% align:center
Miyafuji!

00:15:57.248 --> 00:15:58.166 position:50% align:center
Yoshika?

00:15:58.249 --> 00:15:59.793 position:50% align:center
Is that her magic power?

00:15:59.876 --> 00:16:01.378 position:50% align:center
Did it come back?

00:16:16.059 --> 00:16:17.727 position:50% align:center
Miyafuji... I...

00:16:17.811 --> 00:16:19.604 position:50% align:center
Hey, Shizuka.

00:16:19.688 --> 00:16:22.232 position:50% align:center
The Neuroi? What just happened?

00:16:22.315 --> 00:16:23.900 position:50% align:center
You protected me.

00:16:23.983 --> 00:16:27.278 position:50% align:center
Thanks a lot. You're amazing.

[PATTON]
Uh, yes?

00:16:33.326 --> 00:16:34.994 position:50% align:center
Please take care of Shizuka!

00:16:35.078 --> 00:16:36.246 position:50% align:center
Absolutely.

00:16:36.329 --> 00:16:39.666 position:50% align:center
But, Sergeant, wait--
what do you plan to do?

00:16:39.749 --> 00:16:41.501 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna defeat the Neuroi.

00:16:41.584 --> 00:16:43.753 position:50% align:center
[gasps] You can't
do that alone.

00:16:43.837 --> 00:16:46.172 position:50% align:center
Have you gone crazy?

00:16:46.256 --> 00:16:49.050 position:50% align:center
Maybe so...

00:16:49.134 --> 00:16:52.512 position:50% align:center
But I have to
protect my friends.

00:16:52.595 --> 00:16:54.889 position:50% align:center
There seem to be
fewer Neuroi around.

00:16:54.973 --> 00:16:56.558 position:50% align:center
They're going back
up above ground.

00:16:56.641 --> 00:16:58.351 position:50% align:center
Look.

00:16:58.435 --> 00:17:01.229 position:50% align:center
[PERRINE] Are they reacting
to Miyafuji's magic power?

[YOSHIKA yelling]

00:17:25.545 --> 00:17:27.630 position:50% align:center
[SHIRLEY]
This is all because of Miyafuji?

00:17:27.714 --> 00:17:29.174 position:50% align:center
Maybe we should see
where they're going?

00:17:29.257 --> 00:17:30.216 position:50% align:center
Whatcha think?

00:17:30.300 --> 00:17:31.092 position:50% align:center
Agreed!

00:17:31.176 --> 00:17:32.927 position:50% align:center
Let's head to the surface now.

this sucker off, together!

00:17:39.225 --> 00:17:40.352 position:50% align:center
Right!

00:18:00.914 --> 00:18:03.583 position:50% align:center

[BARKHORN]
Wow, Miyafuji!

00:18:16.721 --> 00:18:18.723 position:50% align:center
[FRANCESCA] Is your magic
power back to normal?

00:18:18.807 --> 00:18:21.059 position:50% align:center
Uh-huh! And all
thanks to Shizuka.

She okay?

00:18:28.858 --> 00:18:31.069 position:50% align:center
What the heck happened up here?

Oh, no.

Hey, something weird's going on.

00:18:40.954 --> 00:18:42.664 position:50% align:center
Why'd it stop attacking?

Uh. The city thing came back!

00:18:52.173 --> 00:18:54.384 position:50% align:center
Wait! How was it
able to do that?

00:18:57.178 --> 00:18:58.805 position:50% align:center
I understand now.

00:18:58.888 --> 00:19:00.557 position:50% align:center
That's Wolf's true form.

00:19:04.561 --> 00:19:06.271 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIER 312C] It's reported
that the Theater forces

completed their objective!

00:19:08.732 --> 00:19:11.276 position:50% align:center
All that's left now
is to destroy Wolf!

00:19:11.359 --> 00:19:14.529 position:50% align:center
We're counting on you,
501st Joint Fighter Wing!

00:19:14.612 --> 00:19:16.197 position:50% align:center
[WITCHES]
Understood!

00:19:18.450 --> 00:19:21.536 position:50% align:center
[MINNA] Our target is
the main unit's core!

00:19:21.619 --> 00:19:24.456 position:50% align:center
It's that bell-like
thing, right?

00:19:24.539 --> 00:19:26.708 position:50% align:center
We've gotta locate it, and fast!

00:19:29.544 --> 00:19:32.213 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIKA yells]

00:19:34.507 --> 00:19:35.467 position:50% align:center
You don't think
it's that building

00:19:35.550 --> 00:19:37.427 position:50% align:center
in the center, do you?

00:19:37.510 --> 00:19:38.970 position:50% align:center
[MINNA]
That would be a fair bet.

00:19:39.054 --> 00:19:41.181 position:50% align:center
Concentrate your
firepower there.

00:19:41.264 --> 00:19:42.599 position:50% align:center
[WITCHES]
Roger!

00:19:42.682 --> 00:19:43.975 position:50% align:center
[FRANCESCA]
Oh, that?

00:20:19.094 --> 00:20:23.431 position:50% align:center
[BARKHORN yelling]

00:20:28.103 --> 00:20:29.396 position:50% align:center
It's trying to flee!

00:20:29.479 --> 00:20:30.563 position:50% align:center
Shirley!

00:20:30.647 --> 00:20:33.274 position:50% align:center
[SHIRLEY]
I'm too far away to catch up!

00:20:33.358 --> 00:20:34.818 position:50% align:center
[BARKHORN]
Get back here!

00:20:36.444 --> 00:20:37.195 position:50% align:center
That thing's quick!

00:20:37.278 --> 00:20:38.697 position:50% align:center
We'll never reach it!

00:20:38.780 --> 00:20:39.531 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:20:39.614 --> 00:20:42.409 position:50% align:center
[yelling]

00:20:51.251 --> 00:20:52.919 position:50% align:center
--[BARKHORN] Miyafuji!
--She pushed it back!

00:20:53.003 --> 00:20:54.546 position:50% align:center
This is our chance!

00:21:24.367 --> 00:21:28.413 position:50% align:center
It really worked.
The sky's blue.

00:21:28.496 --> 00:21:30.457 position:50% align:center
[LYNNE]
Yoshika!

00:21:31.499 --> 00:21:32.584 position:50% align:center
Thanks, Lynne!

00:21:32.667 --> 00:21:34.127 position:50% align:center
You stopped it! Good job!

00:21:34.210 --> 00:21:37.714 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIKA giggles]

00:21:37.797 --> 00:21:40.675 position:50% align:center
Look at that! It's
shattering into pieces!

00:21:55.357 --> 00:21:57.859 position:50% align:center
Nicely done! We did it, Trude!

00:21:57.942 --> 00:22:01.279 position:50% align:center
Uh-huh. It's over.

00:22:01.363 --> 00:22:04.949 position:50% align:center
Minna reporting in.
The 501st Joint Fighter Wing

00:22:05.033 --> 00:22:07.535 position:50% align:center
has annihilated the
enemy target, Wolf.

00:22:07.619 --> 00:22:09.871 position:50% align:center
We took back Berlin!

00:22:41.945 --> 00:22:44.739 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIKA]
Spring, 1946.

00:22:44.823 --> 00:22:46.199 position:50% align:center
The Neuroi nest known as Wolf

00:22:46.282 --> 00:22:48.576 position:50% align:center
in Northern Karlsland
was completely

00:22:48.660 --> 00:22:52.455 position:50% align:center
destroyed, liberating
Berlin in the process.

00:23:04.676 --> 00:23:06.886 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIKA] However,
there are still several known

00:23:06.970 --> 00:23:10.724 position:50% align:center
Neuroi nests in Southern
Karlsland and Ostmark.

00:23:13.435 --> 00:23:15.520 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIKA]
The 501st Joint Fighter Wing's

00:23:15.603 --> 00:23:17.480 position:50% align:center
work is far from over.

00:23:17.564 --> 00:23:20.692 position:50% align:center
The Strike Witches will
continue to fight the war.

00:23:31.286 --> 00:23:34.748 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIKA] And as for me, I'll
continue to do whatever I can

00:23:34.831 --> 00:23:37.167 position:50% align:center
to ensure our victory.
