00:00:11.469 --> 00:00:14.597 position:50% align:center
Operation Southwind,
our mission to retake Berlin,

00:00:14.681 --> 00:00:17.600 position:50% align:center
is scheduled to begin
today at 1200 hours!

00:00:17.684 --> 00:00:18.893 position:50% align:center
[MINNA]
In the last battle,

00:00:18.977 --> 00:00:21.855 position:50% align:center
we heavily depleted Wolf's
anti-air capability.

00:00:21.938 --> 00:00:24.482 position:50% align:center
So, Command decided
now's the time to strike.

00:00:24.566 --> 00:00:27.318 position:50% align:center
Let's go over the details
of the plan, shall we?

00:00:28.695 --> 00:00:31.239 position:50% align:center
[BARKHORN] First, we'll remain
on standby as B-17s

00:00:31.322 --> 00:00:36.494 position:50% align:center
pass above Wolf, dropping
anti-Neuroi fuel-air explosives.

00:00:36.578 --> 00:00:39.748 position:50% align:center
Then, the 501st will destroy
the nest's main unit,

00:00:39.831 --> 00:00:42.917 position:50% align:center
which we believe to be
at the center of Wolf.

00:00:43.001 --> 00:00:43.752 position:50% align:center
Miyafuji.

00:00:43.835 --> 00:00:44.586 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIKA]
Yes, ma'am!

00:00:44.669 --> 00:00:45.962 position:50% align:center
We need you to forge a path

00:00:46.046 --> 00:00:48.048 position:50% align:center
so that we can
reach the main unit.

00:00:48.131 --> 00:00:50.175 position:50% align:center
Can I... pull that off?

00:00:50.258 --> 00:00:51.676 position:50% align:center
[BARKHORN]
Definitely.

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:53.887 position:50% align:center
Of course, the enemy will
strike back with all its got.

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:55.472 position:50% align:center
But if we use
your powerful shield,

00:00:55.555 --> 00:00:57.182 position:50% align:center
we'll be able to break
right through them.

00:00:57.265 --> 00:00:59.225 position:50% align:center
Then we'll forge ahead
at full speed.

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.644 position:50% align:center
'Kay. I'll do my best!

00:01:01.728 --> 00:01:03.563 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKA] Miyafuji's
the key to the mission,

00:01:03.646 --> 00:01:05.648 position:50% align:center
and I'll be right
there with her!

00:01:05.732 --> 00:01:07.817 position:50% align:center
[BARKHORN]
We'll split the unit into two.

00:01:07.901 --> 00:01:09.778 position:50% align:center
[MINNA] One group will head
straight for the main unit,

00:01:09.861 --> 00:01:12.113 position:50% align:center
protected by Miyafuji's shield.

00:01:12.197 --> 00:01:15.033 position:50% align:center
That's me and Captain Barkhorn.

00:01:15.116 --> 00:01:18.411 position:50% align:center
Accompanied by Captain Yeager,
Lieutenant Hartmann,

00:01:18.495 --> 00:01:21.664 position:50% align:center
and the person who works best
with Sergeant Miyafuji:

00:01:21.748 --> 00:01:24.167 position:50% align:center
Sergeant Lynette.

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:26.586 position:50% align:center
The six of us will
take out the main unit.

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.963 position:50% align:center
The rest of you will
provide support.

00:01:29.047 --> 00:01:30.757 position:50% align:center
Let's give it our best, Lynne!

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.385 position:50% align:center
Of course! I'm by your side!

00:01:34.844 --> 00:01:37.722 position:50% align:center
[plane motors whirring]

00:01:37.806 --> 00:01:39.099 position:50% align:center
What's that noise?

00:01:39.182 --> 00:01:41.559 position:50% align:center
[PERRINE] Something big
seems to be flying over.

00:01:41.643 --> 00:01:43.603 position:50% align:center
[MINNA]
Flying here, rather.

00:01:45.063 --> 00:01:48.566 position:50% align:center
[FRANCESCA]
Dang! Don't see that every day!

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:50.819 position:50% align:center
We'll load into the
bomb bays of a B-17

00:01:50.902 --> 00:01:52.195 position:50% align:center
and head for the mission site.

00:01:52.278 --> 00:01:54.114 position:50% align:center
Once we reach Berlin, we drop.

00:01:54.197 --> 00:01:55.490 position:50% align:center
Now get ready!

00:03:35.548 --> 00:03:38.343 position:50% align:center
[PILOT 310A] We'll be entering
the mission zone shortly.

00:03:38.426 --> 00:03:40.470 position:50% align:center
Damn it all!
Why'd we even bother

00:03:40.553 --> 00:03:43.014 position:50% align:center
taking back Kiel if it
all comes to down to this?

00:03:43.098 --> 00:03:45.266 position:50% align:center
In war, you have
to be adaptable.

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:47.769 position:50% align:center
We've been given an
incredible opportunity here.

00:03:47.852 --> 00:03:50.605 position:50% align:center
And we would be fools
not to pounce on it.

00:03:52.232 --> 00:03:54.275 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIKA]
It's okay, Shizuka.

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:55.777 position:50% align:center
We all get nervous.

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:57.362 position:50% align:center
Well, I guess,

00:03:57.445 --> 00:04:00.156 position:50% align:center
but I'm not the one with
the really important job.

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:01.866 position:50% align:center
If you're nervous
about backing me up,

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:03.535 position:50% align:center
I'll take that as a compliment.

00:04:03.618 --> 00:04:05.120 position:50% align:center
But you're gonna do great.

00:04:05.203 --> 00:04:06.454 position:50% align:center
--Thank you!
--[beep]

00:04:06.538 --> 00:04:07.747 position:50% align:center
[PILOT 310A]
We've arrived at Wolf!

00:04:07.831 --> 00:04:09.499 position:50% align:center
Begin the operation!

00:04:09.582 --> 00:04:13.920 position:50% align:center
[PATTON] Bombers, prepare
the anti-Neuroi fuel-air bombs!

00:04:14.004 --> 00:04:15.839 position:50% align:center
Hear that, you Neuroi bastards?

00:04:15.922 --> 00:04:18.049 position:50% align:center
We're blowin' you
straight to Hell!

00:04:18.133 --> 00:04:20.885 position:50% align:center
All units, time to release
your final safeties!

00:04:20.969 --> 00:04:24.222 position:50% align:center
I'm ready to see some
fireworks! Let's go!

00:04:32.313 --> 00:04:34.691 position:50% align:center
Lookin' good, baby!

00:04:40.321 --> 00:04:41.698 position:50% align:center
[PILOT 310A]
Neuroi sighted in the center,

00:04:41.781 --> 00:04:43.616 position:50% align:center
likely Wolf's main unit!

00:04:45.744 --> 00:04:48.121 position:50% align:center
[PATTON]
That's gotta be the one!

00:04:48.204 --> 00:04:50.540 position:50% align:center
501st, you're up!

00:04:51.541 --> 00:04:52.709 position:50% align:center
This's it, Hartmann!

00:04:52.792 --> 00:04:54.127 position:50% align:center
Ready!

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:57.422 position:50% align:center
Focus on the main unit!
Let's end this fight quickly!

00:04:58.965 --> 00:05:00.759 position:50% align:center
And launch!

00:05:08.016 --> 00:05:10.852 position:50% align:center
[BARKHORN]
Is that the only unit? Just one?

00:05:10.935 --> 00:05:13.480 position:50% align:center
It seems to be.
That's all I'm seeing.

00:05:13.563 --> 00:05:14.814 position:50% align:center
Lucky break, then.

00:05:14.898 --> 00:05:17.108 position:50% align:center
We won't need
Miyafuji after all!

00:05:17.192 --> 00:05:19.361 position:50% align:center
Look below it! See?

00:05:20.737 --> 00:05:21.821 position:50% align:center
[SANYA]
The core!

00:05:21.905 --> 00:05:24.157 position:50% align:center
Really? It's just
hangin' out down there!

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:28.203 position:50% align:center
I didn't think we would spot it
without the use of magic!

00:05:28.286 --> 00:05:30.789 position:50% align:center
[gasps] It's fleeing
down into the city--

00:05:30.872 --> 00:05:32.207 position:50% align:center
We can't lose track of it!

00:05:34.209 --> 00:05:36.711 position:50% align:center
Even if the core's exposed,
we can't shoot it from here!

00:05:36.795 --> 00:05:38.630 position:50% align:center
We're going to have
to fly underneath it!

00:05:38.713 --> 00:05:40.632 position:50% align:center
Maintain pursuit
and wait for your shot!

00:05:40.715 --> 00:05:41.925 position:50% align:center
Roger that!

00:05:47.639 --> 00:05:50.308 position:50% align:center
Aw! I wanna shoot things, too!

00:05:50.392 --> 00:05:52.602 position:50% align:center
Hold tight. We're support.

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:57.899 position:50% align:center
Please come back safe.

00:05:57.982 --> 00:06:00.193 position:50% align:center
[SHIRLEY] 'Kay! We're
almost in firing range!

00:06:00.276 --> 00:06:01.653 position:50% align:center
Keep hanging in there!

00:06:01.736 --> 00:06:02.904 position:50% align:center
No prob!

00:06:04.739 --> 00:06:06.533 position:50% align:center
This doesn't make any sense.

00:06:06.616 --> 00:06:08.868 position:50% align:center
The nest should be better
defended than this.

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:21.423 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:06:21.506 --> 00:06:22.966 position:50% align:center
What're those?

00:06:25.844 --> 00:06:27.220 position:50% align:center
Giant walls?

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:31.516 position:50% align:center
Is it an ambush?

00:06:31.599 --> 00:06:33.059 position:50% align:center
Some sort of Wall-type Neuroi?

00:06:33.143 --> 00:06:35.645 position:50% align:center
How are they falling
from the sky?

00:06:37.105 --> 00:06:38.189 position:50% align:center
There're so many!

00:06:38.273 --> 00:06:41.401 position:50% align:center
Were those Neuroi
hiding in the clouds?

00:06:41.484 --> 00:06:42.944 position:50% align:center
[PATTON]
What the hell is this?

00:06:43.028 --> 00:06:45.905 position:50% align:center
Those giant wall things have
surrounded half the damned city!

00:06:45.989 --> 00:06:47.365 position:50% align:center
They're all around us!

00:06:47.449 --> 00:06:49.701 position:50% align:center
The core! We have
to take it out, quick!

00:06:53.538 --> 00:06:55.749 position:50% align:center
I'm worried. Something is wrong!

00:06:55.832 --> 00:06:57.375 position:50% align:center
Just finish it!

00:07:02.797 --> 00:07:04.466 position:50% align:center
We flew straight into a trap.

00:07:04.549 --> 00:07:07.135 position:50% align:center
Those things are firing
at us from all sides!

Miyafuji!

00:07:21.816 --> 00:07:24.319 position:50% align:center
[PATTON] Incredible! Look at
the size of her shield!

00:07:24.402 --> 00:07:27.572 position:50% align:center
Miyafuji's magic is
in a class of its own!

00:07:31.576 --> 00:07:34.245 position:50% align:center
Hope that didn't take
too much out of you!

00:07:34.329 --> 00:07:37.749 position:50% align:center
What are those wall Neuroi?
Nobody warned us!

00:07:40.377 --> 00:07:42.003 position:50% align:center
It's landing in the city!

00:07:49.469 --> 00:07:51.846 position:50% align:center
[BARKHORN] Damn it!
It just blocked off the core!

00:07:51.930 --> 00:07:54.265 position:50% align:center
That looks like a
pretty flawless defense.

00:07:57.727 --> 00:08:00.146 position:50% align:center
Whatever this
stuff is, I hate it!

00:08:01.147 --> 00:08:02.482 position:50% align:center
[PILOT 310A] Multiple Neuroi
have been dispatched

You buncha filthy cockroaches!

00:08:31.094 --> 00:08:32.262 position:50% align:center
This is bad.

00:08:32.345 --> 00:08:34.556 position:50% align:center
Not what I was hoping for!

00:08:36.224 --> 00:08:37.934 position:50% align:center
I just received
an order from HQ.

00:08:38.018 --> 00:08:39.185 position:50% align:center
We're pulling out.

00:08:39.269 --> 00:08:41.521 position:50% align:center
What? We're literally
over Berlin right now.

00:08:41.604 --> 00:08:43.606 position:50% align:center
They expect us to
pack it up and go home?

00:08:43.690 --> 00:08:45.608 position:50% align:center
You wanna stay here and die?

00:08:49.404 --> 00:08:52.073 position:50% align:center
Cease all offensive maneuvers,
we're making a retreat!

00:08:52.157 --> 00:08:55.035 position:50% align:center
Witches, focus on
protecting the bombers.

00:08:55.118 --> 00:08:57.287 position:50% align:center
In other words, our job
is to delay the Neuroi

00:08:57.370 --> 00:08:58.496 position:50% align:center
until the planes are safe?

00:08:58.580 --> 00:08:59.706 position:50% align:center
That's correct.

However, Miyafuji,
you have been ordered

00:09:01.583 --> 00:09:03.126 position:50% align:center
to return to base directly.

00:09:03.209 --> 00:09:05.253 position:50% align:center
Huh? But what's
different about me?

00:09:05.337 --> 00:09:06.671 position:50% align:center
Why can't I stay?

00:09:06.755 --> 00:09:08.923 position:50% align:center
It's important for you
to preserve your power.

00:09:09.007 --> 00:09:11.217 position:50% align:center
'Cause we're going to
need it again very soon.

I want you to
accompany her back.

00:09:20.810 --> 00:09:22.771 position:50% align:center
But I can still fight.

00:09:22.854 --> 00:09:24.147 position:50% align:center
[MINNA]
Yes, but I want you to make sure

00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:25.732 position:50% align:center
she returns to the base safely.

00:09:25.815 --> 00:09:26.816 position:50% align:center
This is an order.

00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:28.485 position:50% align:center

Your orders are to
preserve your magic power!

Keep moving and leave
the fighting to me!

00:09:51.508 --> 00:09:52.509 position:50% align:center
But I--

00:09:58.515 --> 00:10:00.058 position:50% align:center
They're in trouble--

00:10:00.141 --> 00:10:01.059 position:50% align:center
You can't.

00:10:01.142 --> 00:10:02.394 position:50% align:center
Shizuka, move!

00:10:02.477 --> 00:10:04.521 position:50% align:center
I won't, our orders
were perfectly clear

00:10:04.604 --> 00:10:06.272 position:50% align:center
and I intend to follow them.

00:10:06.356 --> 00:10:07.774 position:50% align:center
We just let them die?

00:10:07.857 --> 00:10:09.442 position:50% align:center
You think I'm
gonna agree to that?

00:10:09.526 --> 00:10:10.777 position:50% align:center
Of course not!

00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:12.028 position:50% align:center
Which is why I'll stay here

00:10:12.112 --> 00:10:14.030 position:50% align:center
and protect them while
you make your retreat!

00:10:14.114 --> 00:10:16.324 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Will you
be okay on your own?

00:10:16.408 --> 00:10:18.910 position:50% align:center
Don't you believe in the
power of your own friend?

00:10:18.993 --> 00:10:20.078 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:10:20.161 --> 00:10:23.415 position:50% align:center
Have faith in me.
I'll never let you down!

00:10:26.376 --> 00:10:30.005 position:50% align:center
You're right, Shizuka.
You can handle this.

00:10:40.223 --> 00:10:42.308 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKA]
Commander Minna, come in!

00:10:42.392 --> 00:10:44.602 position:50% align:center
I read you! Is something wrong?

00:10:44.686 --> 00:10:46.896 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKA] I've entered
combat with a Neuroi.

00:10:49.024 --> 00:10:51.943 position:50% align:center
But Miyafuji is heading
back, as ordered!

00:10:52.027 --> 00:10:53.111 position:50% align:center
[MINNA]
Understood.

00:10:53.194 --> 00:10:54.696 position:50% align:center
We'll support you
when we're done here.

00:10:54.779 --> 00:10:56.948 position:50% align:center
In the meantime, hang in
there as best you can!

00:10:57.032 --> 00:10:58.241 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKA]
Roger!

00:10:59.659 --> 00:11:02.871 position:50% align:center
[PILOT 310C] We're arriving
at the 501st's base.

00:11:02.954 --> 00:11:04.372 position:50% align:center
Shizuka.

00:11:06.750 --> 00:11:08.668 position:50% align:center
Now where is your core?

00:11:13.298 --> 00:11:16.092 position:50% align:center
At least I can beat you!

00:11:16.176 --> 00:11:18.762 position:50% align:center
[gasps] These things
self-destruct?

00:11:18.845 --> 00:11:19.929 position:50% align:center
[MINNA]
Even when you're alone,

00:11:20.013 --> 00:11:21.681 position:50% align:center
you have to keep the
big picture in mind!

00:11:21.765 --> 00:11:23.308 position:50% align:center
Try a different angle!

00:11:23.391 --> 00:11:24.559 position:50% align:center
Roger!

00:11:26.519 --> 00:11:30.315 position:50% align:center
She's right. I panicked and
only looked at the top half.

00:11:30.398 --> 00:11:31.649 position:50% align:center
Something's there!

00:11:32.817 --> 00:11:33.985 position:50% align:center
That's it!

00:11:34.069 --> 00:11:36.821 position:50% align:center
Sei-ya!

00:11:45.205 --> 00:11:48.333 position:50% align:center
[panting] I got it.

00:11:50.627 --> 00:11:52.003 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKA groans]

00:11:55.215 --> 00:11:56.341 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:11:56.424 --> 00:11:58.009 position:50% align:center
Thank you, Flight
Lieutenant Yeager.

00:11:58.093 --> 00:11:59.260 position:50% align:center
Wow, nice one!

00:11:59.344 --> 00:12:02.972 position:50% align:center
Took out that big sucker
all on your own!

00:12:03.056 --> 00:12:05.892 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIKA] This is Miyafuji!
I've returned to base!

00:12:05.975 --> 00:12:07.102 position:50% align:center
You made it out?

00:12:07.185 --> 00:12:09.354 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIKA]
Shizuka! Yeah! Thanks to you!

00:12:09.437 --> 00:12:10.772 position:50% align:center
Are you okay?

00:12:12.399 --> 00:12:14.109 position:50% align:center
I'm doing great!

00:12:25.245 --> 00:12:27.747 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIKA]
Ta-dah! Look!

00:12:27.831 --> 00:12:29.499 position:50% align:center
[LYNNE] You're on the
front page, Hattori!

00:12:29.582 --> 00:12:31.835 position:50% align:center
Yes, but this is a bit much.

00:12:31.918 --> 00:12:35.630 position:50% align:center
In truth, I owe it all to your
support, more than anything.

00:12:35.714 --> 00:12:37.757 position:50% align:center
[PERRINE]
"Operation Southwind has begun,

to get valuable information
on the enemy Neuroi.

00:12:44.848 --> 00:12:46.391 position:50% align:center
With the help of the 501st

[MINNA] Miyafuji made it back,
and casualties were minimized,

00:12:54.941 --> 00:12:57.819 position:50% align:center
all thanks to your
bravery. Splendid work.

00:12:57.902 --> 00:12:59.696 position:50% align:center
Well, I was just
following orders,

00:12:59.779 --> 00:13:00.989 position:50% align:center
but thank you, ma'am.

00:13:01.072 --> 00:13:02.365 position:50% align:center
Here's a question!

00:13:02.449 --> 00:13:04.868 position:50% align:center
How'd you get Yoshika to
listen to you and come home?

00:13:04.951 --> 00:13:06.536 position:50% align:center
That's what they shoulda
put on the front page,

00:13:06.619 --> 00:13:09.122 position:50% align:center
if you ask me!
"The Immovable Miyafuji!

[FRANCESCA, SHIRLEY laugh]

00:13:16.713 --> 00:13:19.632 position:50% align:center
The paper makes it sound like
everything's going swimmingly.

00:13:19.716 --> 00:13:22.719 position:50% align:center
Any way you cut it,
our mission was a failure.

00:13:22.802 --> 00:13:24.304 position:50% align:center
[MINNA]
That's just how it is.

00:13:24.387 --> 00:13:27.682 position:50% align:center
The operation has hit a delay,
and now it's over budget, too.

00:13:27.766 --> 00:13:30.643 position:50% align:center
We have to put a positive
spin on it for the press.

00:13:30.727 --> 00:13:32.479 position:50% align:center
Sounds like censorship.

00:13:33.521 --> 00:13:36.274 position:50% align:center
[PATTON]
Roaches! Stinkin' roaches!

00:13:36.358 --> 00:13:37.650 position:50% align:center
[BRADLEY]
Let's calm down, Jerry.

00:13:37.734 --> 00:13:38.818 position:50% align:center
[PATTON]
Berlin was right there--

00:13:38.902 --> 00:13:40.737 position:50% align:center
We almost had those
son of a guns!

00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:42.530 position:50% align:center
Frankly, it pisses me off!

00:13:42.614 --> 00:13:44.366 position:50% align:center
Our first attempt
was only a failure

00:13:44.449 --> 00:13:46.284 position:50% align:center
because we
underestimated the enemy.

00:13:46.368 --> 00:13:49.454 position:50% align:center
But next time, we'll come back
smarter, and stronger, too.

00:13:49.537 --> 00:13:51.247 position:50% align:center
[PATTON]
Ah, time to finally break out

00:13:51.331 --> 00:13:52.999 position:50% align:center
the secret weapon, huh?

00:13:53.083 --> 00:13:55.251 position:50% align:center
Or "weapons," actually.

00:13:55.335 --> 00:13:56.378 position:50% align:center
[PATTON]
This is the Striker Unit

00:13:56.461 --> 00:13:59.506 position:50% align:center
that only Miyafuji
can pilot, correct?

00:13:59.589 --> 00:14:01.341 position:50% align:center
[BRADLEY] Unfortunate,
since I've heard some

00:14:01.424 --> 00:14:03.385 position:50% align:center
worrying reports about her.

00:14:03.468 --> 00:14:05.887 position:50% align:center
Major Sakamoto,
could you bring her here?

00:14:05.970 --> 00:14:08.181 position:50% align:center
Right away, sir.

00:14:08.264 --> 00:14:10.975 position:50% align:center
[PATTON] What? Problems
with her magic pressure?

00:14:11.059 --> 00:14:13.520 position:50% align:center
Yes. She can control
her magic effectively,

00:14:13.603 --> 00:14:16.856 position:50% align:center
but there are some issues with
its recovery after a mission.

00:14:16.940 --> 00:14:18.441 position:50% align:center
In other words, it works fine,

00:14:18.525 --> 00:14:21.069 position:50% align:center
but it takes more time
than usual to recharge?

00:14:21.152 --> 00:14:24.489 position:50% align:center
Right. She has to rest
if she expends too much,

00:14:24.572 --> 00:14:26.700 position:50% align:center
or she can't use
her magic at all.

00:14:26.783 --> 00:14:29.869 position:50% align:center
What percentage is your
magic at right now?

00:14:29.953 --> 00:14:33.498 position:50% align:center
Um, I guess it's
around 80% or so?

00:14:34.749 --> 00:14:36.584 position:50% align:center
For better or for worse,
the next mission

00:14:36.668 --> 00:14:39.546 position:50% align:center
will be the final battle
of Operation Southwind.

00:14:39.629 --> 00:14:42.590 position:50% align:center
That means the 501st
must be in tip-top shape.

00:14:42.674 --> 00:14:43.842 position:50% align:center
So needless to say,

00:14:43.925 --> 00:14:46.177 position:50% align:center
your magic needs to be
fully charged by then.

00:14:46.261 --> 00:14:47.679 position:50% align:center
So we're waiting?

00:14:47.762 --> 00:14:50.432 position:50% align:center
Until the day of the
final battle, no magic--

forbidden to launch

you're on standby!

00:15:11.077 --> 00:15:12.704 position:50% align:center
Our orders are quite clear.

00:15:12.787 --> 00:15:13.788 position:50% align:center
We're under attack!

00:15:13.872 --> 00:15:15.874 position:50% align:center

and do nothing!

You have an important duty
that you must carry out,

to come at a later time.

I understand.

Good luck, everyone.

00:16:13.515 --> 00:16:16.184 position:50% align:center
[FRANCESCA]
It's stinkin' huge!

00:16:16.267 --> 00:16:18.812 position:50% align:center
It's armaments look
rather impressive as well.

00:16:18.895 --> 00:16:20.105 position:50% align:center
Not ideal.

00:16:20.188 --> 00:16:23.108 position:50% align:center
Let's avoid damage
to Kiel, if we can.

00:16:23.191 --> 00:16:24.693 position:50% align:center
First, the decoy unit will draw

00:16:24.776 --> 00:16:26.528 position:50% align:center
the enemy's attention
from the front.

00:16:26.611 --> 00:16:28.947 position:50% align:center
While they do, the core-finder
unit will spread out

00:16:29.030 --> 00:16:30.699 position:50% align:center
and prepare to attack.

00:16:30.782 --> 00:16:33.451 position:50% align:center

00:16:34.786 --> 00:16:36.830 position:50% align:center
Is Miyafuji not coming with us?

00:16:36.913 --> 00:16:40.458 position:50% align:center
She's grounded for now.
She has to conserve her magic.

It's just...

00:16:45.672 --> 00:16:47.590 position:50% align:center
[MINNA] Miyafuji followed
orders because she knew

[MINNA] So its core
should be on the bottom?

00:17:34.012 --> 00:17:35.096 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKA]
Right.

00:17:35.180 --> 00:17:36.389 position:50% align:center
[MINNA]
Got it!

00:17:36.473 --> 00:17:38.558 position:50% align:center
That sounds like
a solid plan to me!

00:17:38.641 --> 00:17:39.809 position:50% align:center
That's good news.

00:17:39.893 --> 00:17:42.020 position:50% align:center
Seems like she's finally
gotten used to combat.

00:17:42.103 --> 00:17:44.939 position:50% align:center
Of course! 'Cause she's amazing!

00:17:45.023 --> 00:17:46.358 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKA]
Those small Neuroi will explode

00:17:46.441 --> 00:17:47.817 position:50% align:center
if you get too close!

00:17:47.901 --> 00:17:49.194 position:50% align:center
Then I'll pick some of them off!

00:17:49.277 --> 00:17:51.237 position:50% align:center
When it's open, head
straight for the core!

00:17:51.321 --> 00:17:52.489 position:50% align:center
Roger!

00:17:58.912 --> 00:18:01.039 position:50% align:center
It should be around
here somewhere.

00:18:03.291 --> 00:18:05.585 position:50% align:center
That's it! All right!

00:18:05.669 --> 00:18:07.962 position:50% align:center
Commander Minna,
I've found the core!

00:18:08.046 --> 00:18:10.215 position:50% align:center
Come in, Hattori!
Can you repeat that?

00:18:10.298 --> 00:18:12.550 position:50% align:center
Something wonky is going
on with the comms.

00:18:12.634 --> 00:18:14.803 position:50% align:center
These little fragments.
Are they chaff?

00:18:14.886 --> 00:18:16.554 position:50% align:center
They're jamming our signals!

00:18:20.058 --> 00:18:21.226 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKA]
Got you!

00:18:21.309 --> 00:18:23.311 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKA gasps]

00:18:23.395 --> 00:18:26.481 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKA]
There's no core. Where is it?

00:18:30.026 --> 00:18:32.404 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKA screams]

00:18:32.487 --> 00:18:35.240 position:50% align:center
Hattori! Are you okay?

00:18:35.323 --> 00:18:36.866 position:50% align:center
What's going on,
Lynne? Tell me!

00:18:36.950 --> 00:18:38.118 position:50% align:center
Is Shizuka hurt?

00:18:38.201 --> 00:18:41.621 position:50% align:center
No good. The enemy
is disrupting our comms.

00:18:41.705 --> 00:18:43.456 position:50% align:center
Stay safe, Shizuka!

00:18:47.460 --> 00:18:48.461 position:50% align:center
[LYNNE]
Hattori!

00:18:49.462 --> 00:18:51.131 position:50% align:center
They're blocking me off!

00:18:51.214 --> 00:18:52.549 position:50% align:center
[BARKHORN]
Damn it!

00:18:52.632 --> 00:18:54.300 position:50% align:center
We can't rescue her with
those things flying around!

00:18:54.384 --> 00:18:56.761 position:50% align:center
If we shoot them and they
blow up, she'll get hurt!

00:18:56.845 --> 00:18:57.887 position:50% align:center
Yeah! I know that!

00:18:57.971 --> 00:18:59.806 position:50% align:center
So what the hell do we do?

00:18:59.889 --> 00:19:04.310 position:50% align:center
Wait a second! Look!
The Neuroi's descending!

00:19:04.394 --> 00:19:05.437 position:50% align:center
Not good!

00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:08.314 position:50% align:center
It's on a collision
course with Kiel!

00:19:08.398 --> 00:19:09.566 position:50% align:center
[COMMS SOLDIER 310A]
The enemy Neuroi is approaching

00:19:09.649 --> 00:19:11.026 position:50% align:center
at a speed of 200 knots!

00:19:11.109 --> 00:19:13.528 position:50% align:center
Altitude is 2400
and dropping quickly!

00:19:13.611 --> 00:19:16.114 position:50% align:center
C'mon, girls. Don't let us die!

00:19:16.197 --> 00:19:17.866 position:50% align:center
Go away!

00:19:20.493 --> 00:19:23.830 position:50% align:center
I keep shooting, but it's
not doing anything!

00:19:23.913 --> 00:19:25.874 position:50% align:center
Mina, are you nuts?

00:19:27.292 --> 00:19:29.210 position:50% align:center
[grunting]

00:19:29.294 --> 00:19:31.546 position:50% align:center
I need to buy as much
time as I can!

00:19:31.629 --> 00:19:33.757 position:50% align:center
You guys get Hattori
out of there!

00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:36.926 position:50% align:center
What, is that a joke?
You can't stop that on your own!

00:19:37.010 --> 00:19:38.428 position:50% align:center
Let me help, too!

00:19:40.930 --> 00:19:41.765 position:50% align:center
[SAKAMOTO]
This is bad.

00:19:41.848 --> 00:19:44.267 position:50% align:center
Hurry up! Let's run!

00:19:44.351 --> 00:19:47.312 position:50% align:center
Where did she go? She wouldn't!

[WITCHES grunting]

00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:55.612 position:50% align:center
Looks like this
wasn't a good plan!

[FRANCESCA]
What do we do? What do we do?

00:19:57.614 --> 00:19:58.865 position:50% align:center
Help!

00:20:01.618 --> 00:20:02.660 position:50% align:center
This might be it.

00:20:02.744 --> 00:20:04.537 position:50% align:center
Buncha bullcrap!

are splitting off!

Let's move!

00:20:25.100 --> 00:20:28.103 position:50% align:center
Wha-What happened? It hurts.

00:20:28.186 --> 00:20:29.771 position:50% align:center
My leg.

[SHIRLEY]
Hattori! Reach out your hand!

00:20:36.945 --> 00:20:38.363 position:50% align:center

Thanks for the save!

Miyafuji!

[MINNA]
Catch her!

00:21:19.946 --> 00:21:21.740 position:50% align:center
Did she use up all her magic?

00:21:21.823 --> 00:21:23.742 position:50% align:center
Looks like it.

00:21:23.825 --> 00:21:26.036 position:50% align:center
Did something happen to her?

00:21:34.794 --> 00:21:37.130 position:50% align:center
[DOCTOR 310A] She doesn't
have any external wounds.

[LYNNE]
That's good.

00:21:38.757 --> 00:21:40.759 position:50% align:center
[MINNA]
But her magic.

00:21:40.842 --> 00:21:42.927 position:50% align:center
What about her magic power?

00:21:43.011 --> 00:21:46.056 position:50% align:center
[DOCTOR 310A] This will require
a more in-depth examination,

00:21:46.139 --> 00:21:48.016 position:50% align:center
but I don't feel
any magic at all.

No. This is...
