[NARRATOR]
It was the year 1939.

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:32.198 position:50% align:center
A mysterious enemy
appeared before humanity

00:00:32.282 --> 00:00:34.534 position:50% align:center
without warning.

00:00:34.617 --> 00:00:38.329 position:50% align:center
These beings came
to be called the "Neuroi."

00:01:13.907 --> 00:01:16.451 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR] It wasn't long before
these fearsome creatures

00:01:16.534 --> 00:01:19.704 position:50% align:center
occupied most of Europe,
driving countless people

00:01:19.788 --> 00:01:22.749 position:50% align:center
from their nations. Their homes.

00:01:25.752 --> 00:01:28.463 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR] But Mankind would
not give up so easily.

00:01:28.546 --> 00:01:31.508 position:50% align:center
They developed a new
weapon to face their foe.

00:01:31.591 --> 00:01:33.510 position:50% align:center
With the power
of this new device,

00:01:33.593 --> 00:01:35.679 position:50% align:center
brave young girls
with magic powers

00:01:35.762 --> 00:01:38.098 position:50% align:center
were able to take to the sky.

00:01:38.181 --> 00:01:41.226 position:50% align:center
It was known as
a "Striker Unit." 

00:01:41.309 --> 00:01:43.853 position:50% align:center
Modern "Witches" from
all over the world donned

00:01:43.937 --> 00:01:47.649 position:50% align:center
these armaments and came
together to fight the Neuroi.

00:01:47.732 --> 00:01:50.485 position:50% align:center
The greatest of these
high-flying heroes belonged

00:01:50.568 --> 00:01:55.990 position:50% align:center
to an elite squad known as
the 501st Joint Fighter Wing.

00:01:56.074 --> 00:01:58.660 position:50% align:center
But the World knew
them by another name.

00:01:58.743 --> 00:02:00.829 position:50% align:center
"The Strike Witches."

00:05:31.081 --> 00:05:32.582 position:50% align:center
This is it.

00:05:32.665 --> 00:05:35.085 position:50% align:center
[SAKAMOTO]
Hm. How charming.

00:05:39.381 --> 00:05:41.841 position:50% align:center
You're looking for a
student from Fuso?

00:05:41.925 --> 00:05:44.636 position:50% align:center
Oh! Then you must be
talking about Yoshika!

00:05:44.719 --> 00:05:45.887 position:50% align:center
[SAKAMOTO]
You know her?

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:48.890 position:50% align:center
Uh-huh! I bet she's in
the library right now.

00:05:48.973 --> 00:05:51.226 position:50% align:center
I'll take you there. This way.

00:05:56.523 --> 00:05:58.400 position:50% align:center
Quite spacious, isn't it?

00:05:58.483 --> 00:06:00.318 position:50% align:center
[ALTIA]
Ah! There she is!

00:06:00.402 --> 00:06:02.153 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIKA grunting]
Steady...

00:06:02.237 --> 00:06:03.780 position:50% align:center
[ALTIA]
Yoshika!

00:06:03.863 --> 00:06:07.492 position:50% align:center
Huh? D'you need
something, Altia?

00:06:07.575 --> 00:06:08.493 position:50% align:center
You have a guest.

00:06:08.576 --> 00:06:10.120 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:06:11.162 --> 00:06:14.958 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIKA gasps]
It's Sakamoto!

00:06:15.041 --> 00:06:16.459 position:50% align:center
[ALTIA]
Yoshika!

00:06:17.752 --> 00:06:18.670 position:50% align:center
Ow, ow, ow.

00:06:18.753 --> 00:06:20.380 position:50% align:center
[SAKAMOTO]
Miyafuji, are you okay?

00:06:20.463 --> 00:06:23.341 position:50% align:center
Yeah, good to see
you again, Sakamoto.

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:27.220 position:50% align:center
[ALTIA]
Okay, I'll be going.

00:06:27.303 --> 00:06:28.346 position:50% align:center
[SAKAMOTO]
Thanks for the help.

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:30.473 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIKA]
Yeah, see you later, Altia.

00:06:30.557 --> 00:06:32.267 position:50% align:center
[ALTIA]
Right. See ya!

00:06:34.853 --> 00:06:38.273 position:50% align:center
Uh. Y'know, you don't have
to wear your hat around here.

00:06:38.356 --> 00:06:40.483 position:50% align:center
I'm not used to
having my hair down.

00:06:40.567 --> 00:06:41.693 position:50% align:center
I think I'll pass.

00:06:41.776 --> 00:06:42.819 position:50% align:center
Really?

00:06:42.902 --> 00:06:44.320 position:50% align:center
But you look cute
with your hair down!

00:06:44.404 --> 00:06:46.823 position:50% align:center
Right, Hijikata?

00:06:46.906 --> 00:06:50.160 position:50% align:center
Uhm. Well. Uh-huh.

00:06:50.243 --> 00:06:52.829 position:50% align:center
[SAKAMOTO] So, what have you
been studying at medical school?

00:06:52.912 --> 00:06:54.247 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIKA]
Right now, I'm learning about

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:56.624 position:50% align:center
different ways
to stop blood loss.

00:06:56.708 --> 00:06:57.834 position:50% align:center
I see.

00:06:57.917 --> 00:06:59.878 position:50% align:center
Seems you're doing
a lot of reading!

00:06:59.961 --> 00:07:01.129 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIKA]
Yup!

00:07:01.212 --> 00:07:03.506 position:50% align:center
I don't get to stay here
as a student forever.

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:07.385 position:50% align:center
Just till the 501st is reformed,
which could be any time.

00:07:07.469 --> 00:07:09.596 position:50% align:center
[SAKAMOTO] Studying every
minute you have, huh?

00:07:09.679 --> 00:07:11.139 position:50% align:center
Quite admirable.

00:07:11.222 --> 00:07:13.224 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIKA] I'm trying,
but all this reading

00:07:13.308 --> 00:07:15.018 position:50% align:center
makes me pretty sleepy.

00:07:15.101 --> 00:07:18.021 position:50% align:center
[SAKAMOTO laughs]

00:07:22.442 --> 00:07:23.610 position:50% align:center
A circus?

00:07:23.693 --> 00:07:25.487 position:50% align:center
Yup! They won't
be in town for long,

00:07:25.570 --> 00:07:27.614 position:50% align:center
so Altia and I were gonna
go check it out today

00:07:27.697 --> 00:07:29.449 position:50% align:center
while we still had the chance.

00:07:29.532 --> 00:07:31.034 position:50% align:center
[SAKAMOTO]
That sounds like fun.

00:07:31.117 --> 00:07:33.411 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIKA] If you think so, then
why don't you come with us?

00:07:33.495 --> 00:07:35.246 position:50% align:center
I heard they have a polar
bear that can ride a bike!

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:36.915 position:50% align:center

Look over there!

It's Altia!

00:07:58.561 --> 00:08:00.605 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Can you get help?

00:08:00.689 --> 00:08:01.856 position:50% align:center
Damn it, where's the trainer?

00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:05.110 position:50% align:center
It won't listen!

she doing, ma'am?

00:08:37.684 --> 00:08:39.477 position:50% align:center
Be quiet and watch.

It's okay. Calm down.

That was crazy.

[HIJIKATA]
Amazing.

00:09:15.722 --> 00:09:18.975 position:50% align:center
I didn't know she could do that!

That's right!

It was acting out 'cause
it was in so much pain.

I see.

00:09:26.191 --> 00:09:28.485 position:50% align:center
I must have bumped the tooth
when we were practicing.

00:09:30.737 --> 00:09:32.322 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry, old pal.

00:09:32.405 --> 00:09:34.783 position:50% align:center

would happen, ma'am?

Well, it <i>is</i> Miyafuji.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:45.377 position:50% align:center
[ALTIA]
Wow, thank you!

00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:47.504 position:50% align:center
That sure did
surprise me, though!

00:09:47.587 --> 00:09:49.964 position:50% align:center
You never told me
that you had magic!

00:09:50.048 --> 00:09:51.966 position:50% align:center
Well, the secret's out!

00:09:52.050 --> 00:09:53.551 position:50% align:center
[ALTIA] But why are you
studying medicine

00:09:53.635 --> 00:09:56.012 position:50% align:center
when you already
have healing magic?

00:09:56.096 --> 00:09:57.931 position:50% align:center
A while back, there was a time

00:09:58.014 --> 00:10:00.517 position:50% align:center
when I couldn't use
my magic at all.

00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:02.394 position:50% align:center
So I thought,
if I studied medicine,

00:10:02.477 --> 00:10:05.980 position:50% align:center
I could keep healing people
whether I have my magic or not.

00:10:06.064 --> 00:10:07.399 position:50% align:center
That's why I asked
to be sent here

00:10:07.482 --> 00:10:08.983 position:50% align:center
as an exchange student.

00:10:09.067 --> 00:10:12.112 position:50% align:center
Are you in the military?
Like, as a Witch?

00:10:12.195 --> 00:10:16.032 position:50% align:center
[SAKAMOTO]
She is. And a fine soldier, too.

00:10:16.116 --> 00:10:18.660 position:50% align:center
In fact, she'll be returning
to the front lines, soon.

00:10:18.743 --> 00:10:20.912 position:50% align:center
Oh. Jeez. Uhm.

00:10:20.995 --> 00:10:23.915 position:50% align:center
Forgive me, I should
have introduced myself.

00:10:23.998 --> 00:10:25.458 position:50% align:center
I'm from the Fuso Navy.

00:10:25.542 --> 00:10:26.668 position:50% align:center
Mio Sakamoto.

00:10:26.751 --> 00:10:29.129 position:50% align:center
Wait. But I recognize that name!

00:10:29.212 --> 00:10:31.589 position:50% align:center
You're a member of
the 501st, aren't you?

00:10:31.673 --> 00:10:34.426 position:50% align:center
Your squad liberated
Gallia and Venezia!

00:10:34.509 --> 00:10:37.137 position:50% align:center
We did. Thanks to Miyafuji.

00:10:37.220 --> 00:10:40.306 position:50% align:center
What? What? Really, Yoshika?

00:10:40.390 --> 00:10:44.019 position:50% align:center
You're part of the 501st
and you ne-ne-never told me?

00:10:45.854 --> 00:10:48.189 position:50% align:center
Uh. I'm sorry?

00:10:48.273 --> 00:10:50.275 position:50% align:center
Oh, thank you!

00:10:50.358 --> 00:10:52.986 position:50% align:center
Um, wha...?

00:10:54.612 --> 00:10:56.239 position:50% align:center
[ALTIA] I didn't think
to mention it before,

00:10:56.322 --> 00:10:59.034 position:50% align:center
but my dad's the captain
of a Venezian warship.

00:10:59.117 --> 00:11:00.785 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIKA]
A captain, huh?

00:11:00.869 --> 00:11:02.996 position:50% align:center
He's a big fan of
yours, by the way.

00:11:03.079 --> 00:11:06.082 position:50% align:center
He said if the 501st wasn't
here to fight the Neuroi,

00:11:06.166 --> 00:11:09.044 position:50% align:center
he and everyone else he
knows would likely be dead.

00:11:09.127 --> 00:11:10.920 position:50% align:center
We're only doing our job.

00:11:11.004 --> 00:11:13.256 position:50% align:center
Some soldiers we'd be
if we couldn't fight.

00:11:13.340 --> 00:11:14.549 position:50% align:center
More or less.

00:11:14.632 --> 00:11:17.552 position:50% align:center
Your father. Is he on
a mission right now?

00:11:17.635 --> 00:11:18.928 position:50% align:center
Yes he is.

00:11:19.012 --> 00:11:20.930 position:50% align:center
He's supposed to be heading
out of the Mediterranean

00:11:21.014 --> 00:11:23.224 position:50% align:center
and into the Atlantic right now.

00:11:23.308 --> 00:11:26.227 position:50% align:center
But he hasn't answered my
letters in quite some time.

00:11:26.311 --> 00:11:28.480 position:50% align:center
This has never happened before.

00:11:28.563 --> 00:11:31.733 position:50% align:center
[gasps] We could use
the radio to contact him!

00:11:31.816 --> 00:11:33.485 position:50% align:center
Right, Sakamoto?

say hello for a moment.

00:11:56.841 --> 00:11:58.843 position:50% align:center
Hello, Dad?

00:11:58.927 --> 00:12:02.847 position:50% align:center
Ah! It's really you!
I'm so glad!

00:12:02.931 --> 00:12:05.392 position:50% align:center
[giggles] Yeah.
One of the Witches.

00:12:05.475 --> 00:12:07.894 position:50% align:center
Uh-huh!

00:12:07.977 --> 00:12:09.312 position:50% align:center
It's been tough,

00:12:09.396 --> 00:12:12.732 position:50% align:center
but I'm so proud to be
a part of the 501st.

00:12:12.816 --> 00:12:16.778 position:50% align:center
Protecting people with my magic
is such a wonderful feeling.

00:12:16.861 --> 00:12:19.239 position:50% align:center
I'm really glad
that I'm a Witch!

00:12:19.322 --> 00:12:21.658 position:50% align:center
Is that so?

00:12:21.741 --> 00:12:23.618 position:50% align:center
I guess I should tell you.

00:12:23.702 --> 00:12:26.496 position:50% align:center
It was inevitable, I suppose,
but I'm afraid that I'm being

00:12:26.579 --> 00:12:29.374 position:50% align:center
officially removed
from the 501st.

00:12:29.457 --> 00:12:31.084 position:50% align:center
[gasps] You're quitting?

00:12:31.167 --> 00:12:33.503 position:50% align:center
That doesn't sound
like you at all!

00:12:33.586 --> 00:12:37.382 position:50% align:center
Not "quitting" exactly.
I'm 21, so I can't use magic.

00:12:37.465 --> 00:12:40.385 position:50% align:center
No matter what my feelings are,
I can't fight as a Witch.

00:12:40.468 --> 00:12:43.304 position:50% align:center
I get it, but that's so sad.

00:12:43.388 --> 00:12:44.472 position:50% align:center
I just...

00:12:44.556 --> 00:12:47.392 position:50% align:center
I can't even imagine
flying without you.

00:12:47.475 --> 00:12:50.770 position:50% align:center
We're going to be launching
a large-scale operation soon.

00:12:50.854 --> 00:12:53.314 position:50% align:center
You'll be entirely too busy
to worry about me.

00:12:53.398 --> 00:12:55.025 position:50% align:center
Another big fight?

00:12:55.108 --> 00:12:56.359 position:50% align:center
[ALTIA]
Hey, Dad?

00:12:56.443 --> 00:12:58.653 position:50% align:center
Hello? What's going on, Dad?

00:12:58.737 --> 00:12:59.696 position:50% align:center
Are you there?

00:12:59.779 --> 00:13:01.114 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIKA]
What's wrong, Altia?

00:13:01.197 --> 00:13:02.449 position:50% align:center
I'm not sure!

00:13:02.532 --> 00:13:04.743 position:50% align:center
It sounds like something
happened to my dad's ship!

00:13:04.826 --> 00:13:05.577 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:13:05.660 --> 00:13:06.786 position:50% align:center
Any details?

00:13:06.870 --> 00:13:08.955 position:50% align:center
We've got lots
of static, suddenly.

00:13:09.039 --> 00:13:10.123 position:50% align:center
Not sure why!

00:13:10.206 --> 00:13:11.583 position:50% align:center
[CARLO]
What is that?

00:13:11.666 --> 00:13:12.917 position:50% align:center
[ALTIA]
Dad!

00:13:13.001 --> 00:13:14.669 position:50% align:center
[CARLO] That iceberg,
it's going to ram into us!

00:13:14.753 --> 00:13:16.880 position:50% align:center
Hey, Dad? You there?

00:13:16.963 --> 00:13:19.883 position:50% align:center
He said there's an iceberg?

00:13:19.966 --> 00:13:21.676 position:50% align:center
It sounds bad.

00:13:40.987 --> 00:13:43.656 position:50% align:center
Impossible! What could
be causing this?

00:13:43.740 --> 00:13:44.824 position:50% align:center
It's hard to say, sir.

00:13:44.908 --> 00:13:46.576 position:50% align:center
But it's advancing
straight towards us!

00:13:46.659 --> 00:13:50.413 position:50% align:center
[CARLO growls] Are you trying
to tell me that iceberg

00:13:50.497 --> 00:13:52.248 position:50% align:center
is targeting our ship?

00:13:52.332 --> 00:13:54.834 position:50% align:center
Captain, the ship's
on a collision course.

00:13:54.918 --> 00:13:57.796 position:50% align:center
Then move! Make a hard
to port, right now!

00:13:57.879 --> 00:13:59.839 position:50% align:center
[ALTIA]
Dad! Hey!

00:13:59.923 --> 00:14:01.257 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry, Altia.

00:14:01.341 --> 00:14:03.343 position:50% align:center
I need to hang up.
But I'm glad I got to hear--

00:14:03.426 --> 00:14:06.554 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIER 301A]
Captain! The iceberg!

00:14:12.310 --> 00:14:14.562 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIERS yell]

00:14:17.357 --> 00:14:19.526 position:50% align:center
No good. Can't reach them.

00:14:19.609 --> 00:14:22.987 position:50% align:center
Something's wrong.
My dad is in trouble.

00:14:23.071 --> 00:14:24.280 position:50% align:center
I swear.

00:14:24.364 --> 00:14:26.116 position:50% align:center
I heard someone screaming
over the radio now!

00:14:26.199 --> 00:14:27.367 position:50% align:center
Screaming?

00:14:27.450 --> 00:14:29.035 position:50% align:center
Did you hear that, Hijikata?

00:14:29.119 --> 00:14:30.912 position:50% align:center
No. I don't think--

00:14:30.995 --> 00:14:33.415 position:50% align:center
I'm not lying!
It sounded really bad!

00:14:33.498 --> 00:14:35.667 position:50% align:center
A Neuroi might be
attacking her dad's ship!

00:14:35.750 --> 00:14:37.419 position:50% align:center
You should order
the Witches to go!

00:14:37.502 --> 00:14:40.714 position:50% align:center
Let's calm down, Miyafuji.
The Neuroi don't like water;

00:14:40.797 --> 00:14:43.258 position:50% align:center
the ship's just dealing
with an iceberg.

00:14:43.341 --> 00:14:47.762 position:50% align:center
Besides, I can't deploy Witches
under such a vague pretense.

00:14:47.846 --> 00:14:49.514 position:50% align:center
Altia.

00:14:49.597 --> 00:14:52.058 position:50% align:center
Your father's a
seasoned navy captain.

00:14:52.142 --> 00:14:57.063 position:50% align:center
One little iceberg won't harm
him, I can assure you that much.

00:14:57.147 --> 00:14:58.690 position:50% align:center
Okay.

00:14:58.773 --> 00:15:00.400 position:50% align:center
Altia, I...

00:15:02.485 --> 00:15:03.820 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIKA]
Sakamoto.

00:15:03.903 --> 00:15:05.864 position:50% align:center
I'll fly to Antwerpen myself!

00:15:05.947 --> 00:15:06.906 position:50% align:center
What?

00:15:06.990 --> 00:15:08.616 position:50% align:center
Are you sure?

00:15:08.700 --> 00:15:11.036 position:50% align:center
You said you heard
screaming, didn't you?

00:15:11.119 --> 00:15:12.579 position:50% align:center
[ALTIA]
M-Mm-hm.

00:15:12.662 --> 00:15:14.289 position:50% align:center
You don't have
to send a team.

00:15:14.372 --> 00:15:17.083 position:50% align:center
No one will complain if
it's just me, will they?

00:15:17.167 --> 00:15:18.418 position:50% align:center
Miyafuji...

00:15:18.501 --> 00:15:20.962 position:50% align:center
I just want to protect them!

00:15:22.630 --> 00:15:24.174 position:50% align:center
Of course you do.

00:15:25.884 --> 00:15:29.929 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:15:30.013 --> 00:15:31.598 position:50% align:center
Should've known!

00:15:31.681 --> 00:15:33.975 position:50% align:center
You haven't changed
a bit, have you?

00:15:34.059 --> 00:15:36.561 position:50% align:center
I guess not?

00:15:36.644 --> 00:15:38.730 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry, ma'am. It's no use.

00:15:38.813 --> 00:15:41.066 position:50% align:center
We don't have any
striker units with us.

00:15:41.149 --> 00:15:42.108 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:15:42.192 --> 00:15:44.152 position:50% align:center
I have a plan,
so don't you worry.

00:15:44.235 --> 00:15:46.404 position:50% align:center
Hijikata, start the jeep.

00:15:49.366 --> 00:15:52.494 position:50% align:center
You bastard. You'll regret that!

00:15:52.577 --> 00:15:53.661 position:50% align:center
Ready the guns!

00:15:53.745 --> 00:15:57.749 position:50% align:center
Target the iceberg
and prepare to fire!

00:15:57.832 --> 00:16:01.336 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIKA] An air force base?
They have one here in Helvetia?

00:16:01.419 --> 00:16:03.046 position:50% align:center
They may be surrounded
by the alps,

00:16:03.129 --> 00:16:06.549 position:50% align:center
but that doesn't guarantee the
Neuroi won't attack eventually.

00:16:06.633 --> 00:16:08.677 position:50% align:center
Our records show they
purchased striker units,

00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:10.845 position:50% align:center
just in case.

00:16:10.929 --> 00:16:13.640 position:50% align:center
[MAYER] Well, well!
This is a real honor!

00:16:13.723 --> 00:16:16.768 position:50% align:center
I'm Mayer, the mechanic here.

00:16:16.851 --> 00:16:19.521 position:50% align:center
Yes. It's nice to meet you.

00:16:19.604 --> 00:16:23.942 position:50% align:center
[MAYER] I never thought I'd get
a chance to help out the 501st!

00:16:24.025 --> 00:16:27.195 position:50% align:center
All that mechanic
training sure paid off!

00:16:27.278 --> 00:16:29.698 position:50% align:center
--Um.
--[YOSHIKA] So, uh, this is it?

00:16:29.781 --> 00:16:31.324 position:50% align:center
It has cobwebs.

00:16:31.408 --> 00:16:33.535 position:50% align:center
Are you sure this
thing is ready to fly?

00:16:33.618 --> 00:16:35.245 position:50% align:center
Well, uh, prob'ly.

00:16:35.328 --> 00:16:36.579 position:50% align:center
Just "probably?"

00:16:36.663 --> 00:16:39.708 position:50% align:center
No, no, no! It's
perfect, guaranteed!

00:16:43.086 --> 00:16:44.129 position:50% align:center
Uh...

00:16:44.212 --> 00:16:45.338 position:50% align:center
Uh-oh.

00:16:45.422 --> 00:16:48.758 position:50% align:center
[sighs] Miyafuji.

00:16:48.842 --> 00:16:50.218 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry, but this won't work.

00:16:50.301 --> 00:16:53.013 position:50% align:center
I'll do it! I'll make it fly!

00:16:53.096 --> 00:16:54.097 position:50% align:center
Are you sure?

00:16:54.180 --> 00:16:55.598 position:50% align:center
But, Yoshika...

00:16:55.682 --> 00:16:57.517 position:50% align:center
You can count on me, Altia.

00:16:57.600 --> 00:16:58.768 position:50% align:center
Don't worry.

00:16:58.852 --> 00:17:01.021 position:50% align:center
Your dad will be okay,
I'll make sure of it!

00:17:01.104 --> 00:17:05.108 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Thanks.
You're so amazing!

00:17:06.568 --> 00:17:07.902 position:50% align:center
[yells]

00:17:19.998 --> 00:17:21.249 position:50% align:center
Let's go!

00:17:25.795 --> 00:17:27.839 position:50% align:center
--[ALTIA] Wow!
--[MAYER] Oh!

00:17:31.634 --> 00:17:33.303 position:50% align:center
Whoa!

00:17:35.013 --> 00:17:36.681 position:50% align:center
What's wrong with this thing?

00:17:36.765 --> 00:17:37.557 position:50% align:center
Miyafuji!

00:17:37.640 --> 00:17:38.683 position:50% align:center
Well, crap!

00:17:38.767 --> 00:17:40.101 position:50% align:center
It looks like the
magic pump's jammed!

00:17:40.185 --> 00:17:41.478 position:50% align:center
What?

00:17:41.561 --> 00:17:43.897 position:50% align:center
Without that, her magic
output will be cut in half!

00:17:43.980 --> 00:17:45.523 position:50% align:center
Now you tell us?

00:17:45.607 --> 00:17:47.192 position:50% align:center
Nothing I can't fix!

00:17:53.907 --> 00:17:55.867 position:50% align:center
--She did it!
--[ALTIA] Oh, wow!

00:17:55.950 --> 00:17:57.869 position:50% align:center
That's wild!

00:17:57.952 --> 00:18:00.872 position:50% align:center
She pushed through the jam
in the pump with brute force!

00:18:00.955 --> 00:18:02.957 position:50% align:center
That's powerful magic!

00:18:03.041 --> 00:18:06.294 position:50% align:center
Go figure. She never changes.

00:18:06.378 --> 00:18:07.253 position:50% align:center
Let's get moving.

00:18:07.337 --> 00:18:08.338 position:50% align:center
Right!

00:18:22.977 --> 00:18:24.229 position:50% align:center
[SHIRLEY sighs]

00:18:24.312 --> 00:18:27.524 position:50% align:center
[FRANCESCA]
Shirley! What's with that face?

00:18:27.607 --> 00:18:28.858 position:50% align:center
Something up?

00:18:30.276 --> 00:18:32.821 position:50% align:center
[SHIRLEY] Do you think
that's a Witch contrail?

00:18:32.904 --> 00:18:34.322 position:50% align:center
[FRANCESCA]
Mm... Probably.

00:18:34.406 --> 00:18:36.449 position:50% align:center
[SHIRLEY]
From what unit, though?

00:18:40.161 --> 00:18:41.496 position:50% align:center
It looks like a Witch.

00:18:41.579 --> 00:18:43.498 position:50% align:center
But no units were ordered
to scramble today,

00:18:43.581 --> 00:18:45.667 position:50% align:center
at least as far as I know.

00:18:45.750 --> 00:18:47.252 position:50% align:center
Maybe they're violating orders?

00:18:47.335 --> 00:18:49.796 position:50% align:center
[PERRINE] There's only one
Witch I know who would do that!

00:18:49.879 --> 00:18:51.840 position:50% align:center
[LYNNE laughs]

00:18:54.676 --> 00:18:56.136 position:50% align:center
[BARKHORN]
What unit is that?

00:18:56.219 --> 00:18:57.470 position:50% align:center
[MINNA]
I don't know.

00:18:57.554 --> 00:18:59.681 position:50% align:center
There aren't any flight
plans filed for Antwerpen.

00:18:59.764 --> 00:19:01.683 position:50% align:center
Maybe they're making
a break for it.

00:19:01.766 --> 00:19:03.184 position:50% align:center
I would go after them,

00:19:03.268 --> 00:19:06.021 position:50% align:center
but now I'm afraid that you'd
make a break for it, too.

00:19:09.065 --> 00:19:12.027 position:50% align:center
[EILA]
Hm...

00:19:12.110 --> 00:19:14.237 position:50% align:center
What's wrong? You see something?

00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:15.655 position:50% align:center
For some reason, the cards say

00:19:15.739 --> 00:19:17.949 position:50% align:center
that Miyafuji's
flying right now.

00:19:18.033 --> 00:19:19.117 position:50% align:center
[SANYA]
That's strange.

00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:21.536 position:50% align:center
I thought she was
at school in Helvetia.

00:19:21.619 --> 00:19:23.997 position:50% align:center
Eh. She's supposed to be.

00:19:38.678 --> 00:19:40.013 position:50% align:center
Miyafuji here.

00:19:40.096 --> 00:19:42.599 position:50% align:center
I've passed Antwerpen
and made it out to sea.

00:19:42.682 --> 00:19:43.767 position:50% align:center
[SAKAMOTO]
Good.

00:19:43.850 --> 00:19:45.185 position:50% align:center
My info says the ship
you're looking for

00:19:45.268 --> 00:19:47.604 position:50% align:center
is a Littorio class, <i>The Doge</i> .

00:19:47.687 --> 00:19:49.731 position:50% align:center
--[YOSHIKA] Roger that.
--[static]

00:19:49.814 --> 00:19:51.733 position:50% align:center
Huh? Sakamoto?

00:19:52.859 --> 00:19:54.277 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Cannons?

00:19:56.988 --> 00:19:58.031 position:50% align:center
That's it!

00:19:58.114 --> 00:20:00.450 position:50% align:center
That's the ship that
Altia's dad is on!

00:20:08.625 --> 00:20:10.168 position:50% align:center
Direct hit! Waiting.

00:20:10.251 --> 00:20:12.671 position:50% align:center
No good. It seems
the target's too big.

00:20:12.754 --> 00:20:15.340 position:50% align:center
It's continuing
to approach, sir!

00:20:15.423 --> 00:20:17.092 position:50% align:center
This thing's a monster.

00:20:22.972 --> 00:20:25.600 position:50% align:center
Why would a battleship
be firing on an iceberg?

00:20:25.684 --> 00:20:27.394 position:50% align:center
500 meters to target sir!

00:20:27.477 --> 00:20:28.687 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIER 301B]
At this rate, it'll hit us

00:20:28.770 --> 00:20:30.814 position:50% align:center
before we reach
the Antwerpen port!

00:20:30.897 --> 00:20:32.273 position:50% align:center
Have you called for help?

00:20:32.357 --> 00:20:33.817 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIER 301B]
The radio's not working.

00:20:33.900 --> 00:20:37.445 position:50% align:center
[growls] I thought we
might escape to Antwerpen,

00:20:37.529 --> 00:20:40.490 position:50% align:center
but what if we're merely
leading the monster there?

00:20:40.573 --> 00:20:44.619 position:50% align:center
Hard to port, men! Switch
all guns to H.E. shells!

00:20:44.703 --> 00:20:45.870 position:50% align:center
Fight it head-on!

00:20:45.954 --> 00:20:47.664 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIER 301A]
Roger! Hard to port!

00:20:47.747 --> 00:20:49.082 position:50% align:center
Turning now!

00:20:51.084 --> 00:20:52.085 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIKA]
That iceberg looks like

00:20:52.168 --> 00:20:54.421 position:50% align:center
it's chasing the ship for sure.

00:20:55.463 --> 00:20:56.464 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:20:58.466 --> 00:20:59.884 position:50% align:center
A beam? No way!

00:20:59.968 --> 00:21:01.636 position:50% align:center
What in the hell was that?

00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:04.139 position:50% align:center
It looks like it was firing
on a Witch up there!

00:21:06.266 --> 00:21:08.101 position:50% align:center
That's not an iceberg.

00:21:24.284 --> 00:21:25.827 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:21:29.039 --> 00:21:30.165 position:50% align:center
That thing's insane.

00:21:30.248 --> 00:21:31.291 position:50% align:center
It's massive!

00:21:31.374 --> 00:21:32.584 position:50% align:center
I see now.

00:21:32.667 --> 00:21:34.794 position:50% align:center
It was a Neuroi all along!

00:21:36.755 --> 00:21:40.050 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIKA] Why did it
turn into an iceberg?

00:21:40.133 --> 00:21:42.177 position:50% align:center
The Neuroi hate water!

00:21:52.062 --> 00:21:54.689 position:50% align:center
Miyafuji! Can you hear me?

00:21:54.773 --> 00:21:55.732 position:50% align:center
Damn it!

00:21:55.815 --> 00:21:59.069 position:50% align:center
What the hell's
going on out there?

00:21:59.152 --> 00:22:02.614 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIKA grunting]

00:23:36.124 --> 00:23:38.585 position:50% align:center
[HARTMANN] I really wonder
what that contrail was.

00:23:38.668 --> 00:23:40.628 position:50% align:center
[SHIRLEY]
Let's check it out, Lucchini!

00:23:40.712 --> 00:23:42.047 position:50% align:center
[FRANCESCA]
Heck yeah!

00:23:42.130 --> 00:23:44.841 position:50% align:center
[BARKHORN] Hey! You're not
going anywhere without me!

00:23:44.924 --> 00:23:47.719 position:50% align:center
[ALTIA] Next time: "The Strike
Witches Come Together"!

00:23:47.802 --> 00:23:49.387 position:50% align:center
Hang in there, Yoshika!
