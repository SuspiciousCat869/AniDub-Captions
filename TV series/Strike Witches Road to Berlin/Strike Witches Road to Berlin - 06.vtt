[bell rings]

00:00:12.762 --> 00:00:13.513 position:50% align:center
[MINNA]
Urgent!

00:00:13.596 --> 00:00:15.390 position:50% align:center
All members of the 501st,

00:00:15.473 --> 00:00:18.059 position:50% align:center
come to the briefing
room immediately!

00:00:19.102 --> 00:00:20.854 position:50% align:center
Would you get up, Hartmann?

00:00:20.937 --> 00:00:23.356 position:50% align:center
[HARTMANN]
Just 40 more minutes!

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:25.066 position:50% align:center
[BARKHORN]
They said it was urgent!

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:27.527 position:50% align:center
[HARTMANN]
Okay, 50 minutes, then.

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:29.112 position:50% align:center
[BARKHORN]
I'm not doing this shtick!

00:00:29.195 --> 00:00:31.031 position:50% align:center
Don't make me leave you here!

00:00:31.114 --> 00:00:32.115 position:50% align:center
[HARTMANN grunts]

00:00:32.198 --> 00:00:35.535 position:50% align:center
[yawns]

00:00:36.911 --> 00:00:38.204 position:50% align:center
Get dressed, would you?

00:00:38.288 --> 00:00:42.083 position:50% align:center
Uh... Hm.

00:00:42.167 --> 00:00:43.793 position:50% align:center
Where did my panties go?

00:00:43.877 --> 00:00:47.255 position:50% align:center
[sighs] This is what happens
when you ignore my advice

00:00:47.339 --> 00:00:48.715 position:50% align:center
and don't clean your room.

00:00:48.798 --> 00:00:50.216 position:50% align:center
And stop sleeping without--

00:00:53.928 --> 00:00:55.805 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Ha!

00:00:55.889 --> 00:00:57.349 position:50% align:center
Hey, you found them!

00:00:57.432 --> 00:00:58.850 position:50% align:center
Ugh.

00:02:34.946 --> 00:02:36.823 position:50% align:center
[yawns]

00:02:40.368 --> 00:02:41.494 position:50% align:center
It's her!

00:02:43.413 --> 00:02:45.832 position:50% align:center
Ladies, good news!

00:02:45.915 --> 00:02:48.168 position:50% align:center
This is top-secret
intel for the moment,

00:02:48.251 --> 00:02:49.586 position:50% align:center
but if this operation works,

00:02:49.669 --> 00:02:52.672 position:50% align:center
our plans to retake Berlin
will be back on track.

00:02:52.756 --> 00:02:53.923 position:50% align:center
Major Sakamoto?

00:02:54.007 --> 00:02:55.550 position:50% align:center
Yes, sir.

00:02:55.633 --> 00:02:57.719 position:50% align:center
As you know,
Operation Southwind--

00:02:57.802 --> 00:03:00.013 position:50% align:center
our plan to destroy
the Neuroi Hive in Berlin--

00:03:00.096 --> 00:03:02.223 position:50% align:center
has been indefinitely postponed.

00:03:02.307 --> 00:03:04.434 position:50% align:center
We have the destruction
of the port in Antwerpen

00:03:04.517 --> 00:03:06.102 position:50% align:center
to thank for that.

00:03:06.186 --> 00:03:08.438 position:50% align:center
Fortunately, we recently
found another port

00:03:08.521 --> 00:03:10.273 position:50% align:center
that remains undamaged.

00:03:11.274 --> 00:03:14.652 position:50% align:center
[SAKAMOTO]
Right here. The port in Kiel.

00:03:14.736 --> 00:03:18.782 position:50% align:center
Unfortunately, Kiel is under
Neuroi control right now.

00:03:18.865 --> 00:03:20.492 position:50% align:center
So, our first step
is to take it back

00:03:20.575 --> 00:03:22.077 position:50% align:center
and establish a beachhead.

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:24.621 position:50% align:center
Then we'll have a path
straight to Berlin!

00:03:27.791 --> 00:03:29.751 position:50% align:center
[MINNA] Your current
mission is a recon job,

00:03:29.834 --> 00:03:32.712 position:50% align:center
to find the best approach
for our attack on Kiel.

00:03:39.219 --> 00:03:41.054 position:50% align:center
[BARKHORN] Fortunately, it looks
like all the Neuroi here

00:03:41.137 --> 00:03:42.597 position:50% align:center
are pretty weak.

00:03:42.681 --> 00:03:44.224 position:50% align:center
[HARTMANN]
We're almost to Hamburg.

00:03:44.307 --> 00:03:46.518 position:50% align:center
Kiel is a little bit
north of that, right?

00:03:46.601 --> 00:03:48.978 position:50% align:center
Yeah, this is a pretty
convenient route.

00:03:49.062 --> 00:03:51.856 position:50% align:center
[HARTMANN] Welp, that's that!
Time to go home!

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:54.401 position:50% align:center
Not yet! We should
take due precaution.

00:03:54.484 --> 00:03:56.611 position:50% align:center
There could be dangers
we haven't found yet.

00:03:56.695 --> 00:03:59.739 position:50% align:center
[HARTMANN] Why do you have
to be so into this?

00:04:01.783 --> 00:04:04.411 position:50% align:center
[stomach growls]

00:04:04.494 --> 00:04:07.122 position:50% align:center
My tummy's not happy with me.

00:04:07.205 --> 00:04:08.206 position:50% align:center
I need snacks.

00:04:08.289 --> 00:04:10.959 position:50% align:center
Enough whining!
And stop being so lazy.

00:04:11.042 --> 00:04:12.669 position:50% align:center
This is a very
important mission!

00:04:12.752 --> 00:04:14.879 position:50% align:center
I know, but I'm still hungry.

00:04:14.963 --> 00:04:17.674 position:50% align:center
It doesn't matter.
Listen, there's no snacks.

00:04:17.757 --> 00:04:19.092 position:50% align:center
[HARTMANN]
Liar.

00:04:19.175 --> 00:04:21.469 position:50% align:center
[HARTMANN] You've got chocolate
in your right pocket.

00:04:21.553 --> 00:04:23.346 position:50% align:center
Uh-- How did you know?

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:27.308 position:50% align:center
When it comes to you,
I know all there is to know!

00:04:27.392 --> 00:04:29.602 position:50% align:center
Uh.

00:04:29.686 --> 00:04:31.271 position:50% align:center
Don't eat it all at once.

00:04:31.354 --> 00:04:33.231 position:50% align:center
No promises on that!

00:04:35.608 --> 00:04:36.651 position:50% align:center
What the--?

00:04:41.406 --> 00:04:42.157 position:50% align:center
A Neuroi.

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:43.324 position:50% align:center
I see it.

00:04:51.499 --> 00:04:52.917 position:50% align:center
[HARTMANN]
Better purge our drop tanks.

00:04:53.001 --> 00:04:55.128 position:50% align:center
[BARKHORN]
Wait. It's not a big one.

00:04:55.211 --> 00:04:58.048 position:50% align:center
We can leave our drop tanks on.

00:04:58.131 --> 00:04:59.466 position:50% align:center
It's coming!

00:05:07.807 --> 00:05:08.933 position:50% align:center
It's fast!

00:05:17.317 --> 00:05:18.526 position:50% align:center
Bastard!

00:05:20.195 --> 00:05:21.363 position:50% align:center
Careful!

00:05:26.159 --> 00:05:27.327 position:50% align:center
It locked on!

00:05:29.996 --> 00:05:31.122 position:50% align:center
I've got you!

00:05:40.256 --> 00:05:41.549 position:50% align:center
[HARTMANN]
Where is it?

00:05:43.468 --> 00:05:45.011 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Look down!

00:05:45.095 --> 00:05:46.096 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:05:58.358 --> 00:05:59.234 position:50% align:center
She's falling!

00:05:59.317 --> 00:06:02.028 position:50% align:center
[screaming]

00:06:02.112 --> 00:06:04.155 position:50% align:center
Hartmann!

00:06:04.239 --> 00:06:06.700 position:50% align:center
Outta my way!

00:06:13.456 --> 00:06:15.458 position:50% align:center
Wait. Behind me?

00:06:15.542 --> 00:06:16.793 position:50% align:center
Can't keep up!

00:06:18.878 --> 00:06:21.089 position:50% align:center
[groans] You're tough!

00:06:24.968 --> 00:06:25.969 position:50% align:center
Who's there?

00:06:26.052 --> 00:06:27.429 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIKA]
We've got you!

00:06:27.512 --> 00:06:29.222 position:50% align:center
Miyafuji! Hattori!

00:06:29.305 --> 00:06:31.641 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIKA] Your striker
unit--it's banged up!

00:06:31.725 --> 00:06:32.934 position:50% align:center
We gotta go!

00:06:33.018 --> 00:06:35.395 position:50% align:center
We can't leave! The Neuroi
shot Hartmann down!

00:06:35.478 --> 00:06:36.980 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:06:41.276 --> 00:06:42.986 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIKA grunts]

00:06:43.069 --> 00:06:45.071 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKA] Miyafuji,
we have to return to base.

00:06:45.155 --> 00:06:46.906 position:50% align:center
At this rate,
we'll all be shot down!

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:48.575 position:50% align:center
Got it. We'll help Barkhorn!

00:06:48.658 --> 00:06:49.409 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKA]
Roger!

00:06:49.492 --> 00:06:52.662 position:50% align:center
Let go! Stop it, Miyafuji!

00:06:52.746 --> 00:06:53.997 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry!

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:56.207 position:50% align:center
I know how you feel,
but there's no other choice!

00:07:06.968 --> 00:07:08.970 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKA] We're outside of
its air superiority zone.

00:07:09.054 --> 00:07:10.263 position:50% align:center
It won't pursue.

00:07:10.347 --> 00:07:11.514 position:50% align:center
Bastard!

00:07:12.515 --> 00:07:15.602 position:50% align:center
[yells]

00:07:16.603 --> 00:07:18.396 position:50% align:center
[SHIRLEY]
Hartmann was shot down?

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:20.273 position:50% align:center
[FRANCESCA]
What happened after that?

00:07:20.357 --> 00:07:22.150 position:50% align:center
She fell deep into the forest.

00:07:22.233 --> 00:07:24.778 position:50% align:center
We can't get a response
from her radio.

00:07:24.861 --> 00:07:27.072 position:50% align:center
This is a nightmare.

00:07:27.155 --> 00:07:30.492 position:50% align:center
[MINNA] I can't believe
Lieutenant Hartmann went down.

00:07:30.575 --> 00:07:33.870 position:50% align:center
All right, tell me exactly
where she was last seen.

00:07:33.953 --> 00:07:36.039 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKA]
Here. Near Hamburg.

00:07:36.122 --> 00:07:37.916 position:50% align:center
The sun is setting.

00:07:37.999 --> 00:07:40.210 position:50% align:center
We'll send the rescue
team out tomorrow.

00:07:40.293 --> 00:07:41.586 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKA] We'll need
to come up with a plan

00:07:41.670 --> 00:07:43.588 position:50% align:center
if we want to
defeat that Neuroi.

00:07:43.672 --> 00:07:44.964 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIKA]
It was fast enough to launch

00:07:45.048 --> 00:07:47.676 position:50% align:center
a surprise attack on Barkhorn.

00:07:47.759 --> 00:07:50.178 position:50% align:center
This'll be rough.

00:07:50.261 --> 00:07:52.806 position:50% align:center
By the way. Where is Barkhorn?

00:07:57.519 --> 00:07:58.728 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:08:05.694 --> 00:08:08.071 position:50% align:center
It's way too hot in here.

00:08:08.154 --> 00:08:09.698 position:50% align:center
How long have you
been sitting there?

00:08:09.781 --> 00:08:12.075 position:50% align:center
I made a bad call.
I made a bad call.

00:08:12.158 --> 00:08:13.410 position:50% align:center
Talk to me.

00:08:13.493 --> 00:08:16.454 position:50% align:center
If you're feeling guilty,
this wasn't your fault.

00:08:16.538 --> 00:08:18.748 position:50% align:center
I was too slow to
purge the drop tanks.

00:08:18.832 --> 00:08:19.916 position:50% align:center
She told me.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.211 position:50% align:center
In battle, you can't
predict everything.

00:08:23.294 --> 00:08:25.255 position:50% align:center
Blaming yourself doesn't help.

00:08:25.338 --> 00:08:27.674 position:50% align:center
All that matters is
how you move forward.

00:08:27.757 --> 00:08:29.259 position:50% align:center
How you persevere.

00:08:29.342 --> 00:08:30.677 position:50% align:center
[BARKHORN]
Even after we purged,

00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:32.804 position:50% align:center
I still let it get behind me.

00:08:32.887 --> 00:08:34.806 position:50% align:center
Trude, listen!

00:08:34.889 --> 00:08:36.933 position:50% align:center
[BARKHORN]
It's too fast.

00:08:37.017 --> 00:08:39.519 position:50% align:center
It doesn't matter how much
training a Witch has,

00:08:39.602 --> 00:08:41.855 position:50% align:center
you can't travel there,
engage with the Neuroi,

00:08:41.938 --> 00:08:44.691 position:50% align:center
and get back to base
without a drop tank.

00:08:44.774 --> 00:08:47.360 position:50% align:center
When a Witch is stuck
in enemy territory,

00:08:47.444 --> 00:08:49.195 position:50% align:center
her survival rate will drop...

00:08:49.279 --> 00:08:51.406 position:50% align:center
Come on, Trude.

00:08:51.489 --> 00:08:53.116 position:50% align:center
[BARKHORN]
It's already night.

00:08:53.199 --> 00:08:56.202 position:50% align:center
Tomorrow, we'll send
in a rescue team.

00:08:56.286 --> 00:08:58.830 position:50% align:center
You're staying here. You got it?

00:09:09.424 --> 00:09:14.137 position:50% align:center
[HARTMANN] This thing really
won't cut me a break!

00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:16.348 position:50% align:center
No fixing that mess.

00:09:19.225 --> 00:09:22.145 position:50% align:center
And it looks like my
radio's busted, too.

00:09:24.689 --> 00:09:26.608 position:50% align:center
[HARTMANN]
Ugh. What to do.

00:09:26.691 --> 00:09:28.526 position:50% align:center
What to do.

00:09:31.071 --> 00:09:32.614 position:50% align:center
[MINNA]
It's around 300 kilometers

00:09:32.697 --> 00:09:34.699 position:50% align:center
to the point where
Lieutenant Hartmann crashed.

00:09:34.783 --> 00:09:37.160 position:50% align:center
Given the amount of time
the search will take,

00:09:37.243 --> 00:09:38.828 position:50% align:center
I've chosen the three of you,

00:09:38.912 --> 00:09:42.457 position:50% align:center
based on your strong performance
on long-distance flights.

00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:44.292 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
Roger!

00:09:44.376 --> 00:09:46.503 position:50% align:center
[SHIRLEY]
Barkhorn skipped breakfast?

00:09:46.586 --> 00:09:47.629 position:50% align:center
Uh-huh.

00:09:47.712 --> 00:09:49.339 position:50% align:center
She skipped dinner
last night, too,

00:09:49.422 --> 00:09:50.799 position:50% align:center
but when I tried
taking her food,

00:09:50.882 --> 00:09:52.384 position:50% align:center
she said she wasn't hungry.

00:09:52.467 --> 00:09:54.344 position:50% align:center
But she told me that
proper nutrition

00:09:54.427 --> 00:09:56.763 position:50% align:center
is a part of our mission!

00:09:56.846 --> 00:09:58.848 position:50% align:center
Barkhorn! You okay?

00:10:07.649 --> 00:10:09.317 position:50% align:center
She's fine. Just gettin' ripped.

00:10:09.401 --> 00:10:10.527 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIKA]
Hey, Barkhorn.

00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:12.696 position:50% align:center
I heard that you've
been skipping meals.

00:10:12.779 --> 00:10:16.574 position:50% align:center
Leave me alone.
It's none of your business.

00:10:16.658 --> 00:10:18.243 position:50% align:center
Captain. We're about to scramble

00:10:18.326 --> 00:10:20.203 position:50% align:center
to rescue Lieutenant
Hartmann soon.

00:10:20.286 --> 00:10:23.623 position:50% align:center
We will be in and out.
Back in a snap, I promise.

00:10:27.293 --> 00:10:30.755 position:50% align:center
[BARKHORN] You're not
good enough, Liberion.

00:10:30.839 --> 00:10:31.798 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah?

00:10:31.881 --> 00:10:33.341 position:50% align:center
You pickin' a fight with me?

00:10:33.425 --> 00:10:34.676 position:50% align:center
I know you're concerned,

00:10:34.759 --> 00:10:36.136 position:50% align:center
but the Flight
Lieutenant has defeated

00:10:36.219 --> 00:10:37.846 position:50% align:center
some extremely fast Neuroi.

00:10:37.929 --> 00:10:39.431 position:50% align:center
Damn straight.

00:10:39.514 --> 00:10:43.435 position:50% align:center
My Striker Unit won't lose to
any enemy in a battle of speed.

00:10:43.518 --> 00:10:47.772 position:50% align:center
I know how fast you are.
But that's not enough.

00:10:47.856 --> 00:10:50.442 position:50% align:center
Listen, anyone would feel
bad after what happened,

00:10:50.525 --> 00:10:52.861 position:50% align:center
but there's no need
to blame yourself.

00:10:54.738 --> 00:10:57.365 position:50% align:center
I'm taking a shower.
You've said enough.

00:10:59.325 --> 00:11:02.370 position:50% align:center
I should have expected
this out of her.

00:11:02.454 --> 00:11:04.372 position:50% align:center
She's really hurting.

00:11:06.791 --> 00:11:09.252 position:50% align:center
[SHIRLEY]
Rescue squad. Launching!

00:11:15.759 --> 00:11:19.012 position:50% align:center
Erica. You have to come back.

00:11:44.788 --> 00:11:46.414 position:50% align:center
You big sucker!

00:11:46.498 --> 00:11:48.958 position:50% align:center
You fell for it, didn't you?

00:11:52.462 --> 00:11:53.338 position:50% align:center
[stomach growls]

00:11:53.421 --> 00:11:55.173 position:50% align:center
[HARTMANN]
Ah...

00:12:02.097 --> 00:12:03.098 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIKA]
This is almost the spot

00:12:03.181 --> 00:12:06.101 position:50% align:center
where Hartmann was shot down.

00:12:06.184 --> 00:12:08.812 position:50% align:center
Miyafuji? Is my radio working?

00:12:08.895 --> 00:12:11.815 position:50% align:center
It's Erica! Hey,
can you hear me?

00:12:11.898 --> 00:12:14.776 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKA] There's no response
from Lieutenant Hartmann.

00:12:14.859 --> 00:12:16.319 position:50% align:center
[SHIRLEY]
Her radio might be broken.

00:12:16.403 --> 00:12:20.990 position:50% align:center
[HARTMANN] Mm. This sucks!
My transmitter's all busted!

00:12:22.283 --> 00:12:23.576 position:50% align:center
[GROUP gasps]

00:12:32.210 --> 00:12:34.504 position:50% align:center
[SHIRLEY] Damn it!
That rotten little cheater!

00:12:34.587 --> 00:12:36.339 position:50% align:center
[FRANCESCA]
Shirley! Are you okay?

00:12:36.423 --> 00:12:39.009 position:50% align:center
[SHIRLEY] I'm fine.
My unit is damaged, though.

00:12:39.092 --> 00:12:40.176 position:50% align:center
The bastard.

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:42.387 position:50% align:center
It snuck up on me
in no time flat.

00:12:42.470 --> 00:12:44.639 position:50% align:center
It's one tough cookie,
that's for sure.

00:12:44.723 --> 00:12:47.350 position:50% align:center
It's so fast, even
Shirley can't keep up?

00:12:47.434 --> 00:12:48.643 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIKA]
So, uh.

00:12:48.727 --> 00:12:51.521 position:50% align:center
What should we do for
the next rescue mission?

00:12:55.608 --> 00:12:57.694 position:50% align:center
[MINNA]
I'll decide by tomorrow.

00:12:59.779 --> 00:13:02.866 position:50% align:center
[MINNA] The attempt
to rescue Erica failed.

00:13:02.949 --> 00:13:04.451 position:50% align:center
[BARKHORN]
Of course it did.

00:13:04.534 --> 00:13:07.037 position:50% align:center
Shirley's unit has
an amazing top speed,

00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:09.497 position:50% align:center
but fighting that
Neuroi isn't a race.

00:13:09.581 --> 00:13:11.249 position:50% align:center
The way it accelerates
and decelerates

00:13:11.332 --> 00:13:13.293 position:50% align:center
in an instant is the problem.

00:13:13.376 --> 00:13:15.545 position:50% align:center
[MINNA] We've never had
to deal with this before.

00:13:15.628 --> 00:13:16.921 position:50% align:center
[BARKHORN]
I'm going next time.

00:13:17.005 --> 00:13:18.423 position:50% align:center
I understand your feelings,

00:13:18.506 --> 00:13:21.009 position:50% align:center
but even Shirley
couldn't handle it.

00:13:21.092 --> 00:13:22.927 position:50% align:center
[BARKHORN]
Minna.

00:13:23.011 --> 00:13:26.139 position:50% align:center
My partner's out there
waiting for me.

00:13:26.222 --> 00:13:27.515 position:50% align:center
Yeah, but...

00:13:27.599 --> 00:13:31.811 position:50% align:center
[BARKHORN] I'll be ready
tomorrow morning. Please.

00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:35.482 position:50% align:center
Damn it.

00:13:35.565 --> 00:13:38.193 position:50% align:center
How do I stop that thing from
blindsiding me a second time?

00:13:41.738 --> 00:13:43.406 position:50% align:center
[SHIRLEY]
Barkhorn?

00:13:43.490 --> 00:13:45.450 position:50% align:center
I have a favor to ask you.

00:13:45.533 --> 00:13:46.284 position:50% align:center
You're a mess!

00:13:46.368 --> 00:13:47.952 position:50% align:center
You gotta take it easy!

00:13:48.036 --> 00:13:50.080 position:50% align:center
Will you help me or not?

00:13:52.415 --> 00:13:55.085 position:50% align:center
Let me hear what
you're thinkin'.

00:13:55.168 --> 00:13:57.462 position:50% align:center
Commander Minna,
does Captain Barkhorn

00:13:57.545 --> 00:14:00.090 position:50% align:center
have a strategy to
defeat the Neuroi?

00:14:00.173 --> 00:14:01.716 position:50% align:center
She didn't tell me.

00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:03.134 position:50% align:center
I trust her.

00:14:03.218 --> 00:14:05.637 position:50% align:center
She'll win this battle somehow.

00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:06.805 position:50% align:center
[door opens]

00:14:06.888 --> 00:14:07.847 position:50% align:center
[BARKHORN]
I'm ready.

00:14:07.931 --> 00:14:08.765 position:50% align:center
[ALL gasp]

00:14:08.848 --> 00:14:10.141 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKA]
Captain Barkhorn!

00:14:10.225 --> 00:14:11.976 position:50% align:center
We're ready to rock.

00:14:12.060 --> 00:14:15.313 position:50% align:center
I'll handle this.
I won't lose again.

00:14:17.357 --> 00:14:19.150 position:50% align:center
Your Striker Unit changed.

00:14:19.234 --> 00:14:20.985 position:50% align:center
[SHIRLEY]
I modified it personally.

00:14:21.069 --> 00:14:23.530 position:50% align:center
It's much lighter than
the original build.

00:14:23.613 --> 00:14:26.324 position:50% align:center
[SHIRLEY] I've decreased the air
resistance as much as possible.

00:14:26.408 --> 00:14:29.244 position:50% align:center
I've smoothed out the surface,
ditched the rivets,

00:14:29.327 --> 00:14:33.081 position:50% align:center
taken off the
paint and waxed it.

00:14:33.164 --> 00:14:33.957 position:50% align:center
[ALL gasp]

00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:35.500 position:50% align:center
You got ripped!

00:14:35.583 --> 00:14:37.293 position:50% align:center
[MINNA]
Quite the transformation!

00:14:37.377 --> 00:14:38.461 position:50% align:center
[BARKHORN]
I dropped my weight,

00:14:38.545 --> 00:14:41.047 position:50% align:center
but worked hard to
maintain my muscle mass.

00:14:41.131 --> 00:14:42.382 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKA]
So that's why you were spending

00:14:42.465 --> 00:14:44.092 position:50% align:center
so much time in the sauna!

00:14:44.175 --> 00:14:46.428 position:50% align:center
To turn my body into a weapon.

00:14:46.511 --> 00:14:48.513 position:50% align:center
And this is your plan
to defeat the Neuroi?

00:14:48.596 --> 00:14:50.390 position:50% align:center
There is nothing
healthy about this.

00:14:50.473 --> 00:14:53.309 position:50% align:center
I will need both speed
and mobility to win.

00:14:53.393 --> 00:14:55.520 position:50% align:center
Extreme or not,
this is the only way.

00:14:55.603 --> 00:14:57.272 position:50% align:center
I see.

00:15:01.735 --> 00:15:03.445 position:50% align:center
[MINNA] She'll need to
preserve her magic power

00:15:03.528 --> 00:15:05.488 position:50% align:center
as much as possible,
so I want you two

00:15:05.572 --> 00:15:07.198 position:50% align:center
to carry her to the battle area.

00:15:07.282 --> 00:15:08.450 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
Roger!

00:15:08.533 --> 00:15:10.618 position:50% align:center
Miyafuji, are you all right?

00:15:10.702 --> 00:15:12.871 position:50% align:center
Your magical pressure
just stabilized.

00:15:12.954 --> 00:15:14.247 position:50% align:center
This isn't too much?

00:15:14.330 --> 00:15:15.707 position:50% align:center
No, I'm great!

00:15:15.790 --> 00:15:19.544 position:50% align:center
I was useless for way too long.
I'm excited to help out!

00:15:21.212 --> 00:15:22.255 position:50% align:center
[SHIRLEY]
Looking good.

00:15:22.339 --> 00:15:24.924 position:50% align:center
Thank you for everything.
I owe you.

00:15:25.008 --> 00:15:27.344 position:50% align:center
Yeah, for keeping
me up all night.

00:15:29.346 --> 00:15:30.347 position:50% align:center
What's this?

00:15:30.430 --> 00:15:31.973 position:50% align:center
[SHIRLEY]
A present from me.

00:15:32.057 --> 00:15:33.183 position:50% align:center
Good luck.

00:15:33.266 --> 00:15:35.769 position:50% align:center
Bring Hartmann back
in time for dinner!

00:15:35.852 --> 00:15:37.771 position:50% align:center
I'm on it!

00:15:37.854 --> 00:15:39.064 position:50% align:center
Take off!

00:15:42.275 --> 00:15:44.652 position:50% align:center
There! Should be able
to fly a little now.

00:15:44.736 --> 00:15:47.364 position:50% align:center
[stomach growls]

00:15:54.621 --> 00:15:56.539 position:50% align:center
The last piece!

00:15:57.749 --> 00:16:00.543 position:50% align:center
[HARTMANN] I should probably
stay hydrated, at least.

00:16:04.297 --> 00:16:05.757 position:50% align:center
[radio static]

00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:07.133 position:50% align:center
[HARTMANN]
They're back.

00:16:10.804 --> 00:16:13.264 position:50% align:center
[HARTMANN]
Miyafuji? Hattori?

00:16:13.348 --> 00:16:14.974 position:50% align:center
And Trude, too!

00:16:16.601 --> 00:16:18.895 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKA]
Almost in the enemy's territory.

00:16:18.978 --> 00:16:21.773 position:50% align:center
[panting]

00:16:21.856 --> 00:16:24.693 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKA] Miyafuji's
pushing herself too hard.

00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:31.366 position:50% align:center
Up there!

00:16:33.034 --> 00:16:34.244 position:50% align:center
Let me go!

00:16:35.578 --> 00:16:37.747 position:50% align:center
This ain't gonna play
out like last time!

00:16:48.633 --> 00:16:49.926 position:50% align:center
[BARKHORN growls]

00:16:55.807 --> 00:16:58.560 position:50% align:center
Darn it! No way I can keep up!

00:16:58.643 --> 00:17:00.603 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKA]
Yeah, I can't even aim!

00:17:02.230 --> 00:17:04.315 position:50% align:center
How did she get so fast?

00:17:07.861 --> 00:17:12.907 position:50% align:center
[yells]

00:17:12.991 --> 00:17:14.868 position:50% align:center
Suck on this!

00:17:17.871 --> 00:17:19.247 position:50% align:center
Found your core!

00:17:28.590 --> 00:17:30.091 position:50% align:center
Go to hell!

00:17:32.510 --> 00:17:35.430 position:50% align:center
Yay! You're my hero, Trude!

00:17:35.513 --> 00:17:36.473 position:50% align:center
The plan worked!

00:17:36.556 --> 00:17:38.808 position:50% align:center
Nice one, Barkhorn!

00:17:38.892 --> 00:17:39.809 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKA]
There's something in the forest!

00:17:39.893 --> 00:17:40.727 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIKA gasps]

00:17:40.810 --> 00:17:42.145 position:50% align:center
You found Hartmann?

00:17:43.605 --> 00:17:44.856 position:50% align:center
[BARKHORN gasps]

00:17:46.608 --> 00:17:49.110 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKA]
Oh, no. Lieutenant Hartmann?

00:17:49.194 --> 00:17:50.403 position:50% align:center
Can't be.

00:17:50.487 --> 00:17:55.033 position:50% align:center
Erica! Erica!

00:17:55.116 --> 00:17:57.285 position:50% align:center
What's wrong?

00:17:57.369 --> 00:18:00.580 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Oh, no, no, no!

00:18:00.663 --> 00:18:02.082 position:50% align:center
This is awful.

00:18:02.165 --> 00:18:04.501 position:50% align:center
[mechanical whirring]

00:18:04.584 --> 00:18:05.460 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKA]
Look!

00:18:05.543 --> 00:18:06.920 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIKA]
There's another one!

00:18:15.303 --> 00:18:19.265 position:50% align:center
Erica. Without you...

00:18:19.349 --> 00:18:21.226 position:50% align:center
I can't...

00:18:21.309 --> 00:18:23.353 position:50% align:center
I can't...

00:18:23.436 --> 00:18:27.649 position:50% align:center
Even if we take back Berlin,
without you, there's no point!

00:18:27.732 --> 00:18:30.318 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIKA yells]

00:18:30.402 --> 00:18:33.446 position:50% align:center
[BARKHORN]
Miyafuji, that's enough.

00:18:33.530 --> 00:18:35.365 position:50% align:center
It's over now.

00:18:35.448 --> 00:18:38.368 position:50% align:center
Barkhorn, no! Don't you
dare give up on me!

00:18:38.451 --> 00:18:40.245 position:50% align:center
[BARKHORN]
There's no point in going on.

00:18:40.328 --> 00:18:41.538 position:50% align:center
Not without you, Erica.

00:18:41.621 --> 00:18:42.706 position:50% align:center
[HARTMANN]
Oh, no, Trude.

00:18:42.789 --> 00:18:44.040 position:50% align:center
Just hang on a sec.

00:18:44.124 --> 00:18:47.127 position:50% align:center
You're not just a partner;
you're everything to me!

00:18:47.210 --> 00:18:49.212 position:50% align:center
[HARTMANN panting]

00:18:50.505 --> 00:18:52.716 position:50% align:center
Wait. I found it!

00:18:52.799 --> 00:18:54.384 position:50% align:center
This should work!

[BARKHORN gasps]

00:19:04.561 --> 00:19:06.229 position:50% align:center
I can't hold on!

00:19:06.312 --> 00:19:12.569 position:50% align:center
[BARKHORN laughs]

00:19:12.652 --> 00:19:14.237 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIKA]
You're going to fight?

00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:15.530 position:50% align:center
Everything's fine now.

00:19:15.613 --> 00:19:16.823 position:50% align:center
Don't worry.

00:19:19.284 --> 00:19:24.164 position:50% align:center
[yelling]

00:19:24.247 --> 00:19:26.041 position:50% align:center
It's just you and me!

00:19:30.503 --> 00:19:32.422 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKA]
It purged part of itself?

00:19:32.505 --> 00:19:34.257 position:50% align:center
It's speeding up!

00:19:34.341 --> 00:19:36.885 position:50% align:center
[BARKHORN]
Then I will, too!

00:19:36.968 --> 00:19:37.886 position:50% align:center
She dropped her gun?

00:19:37.969 --> 00:19:39.262 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKA]
This is insane!

00:19:56.112 --> 00:19:57.280 position:50% align:center
Now!

00:20:01.242 --> 00:20:05.246 position:50% align:center
[grunts] Sturm!

Finish him off!

00:20:13.588 --> 00:20:15.090 position:50% align:center
Right!

00:20:19.135 --> 00:20:21.429 position:50% align:center
You picked the wrong
girl to take on.

00:20:28.895 --> 00:20:31.064 position:50% align:center
We won! They got it!

00:20:31.147 --> 00:20:33.400 position:50% align:center
And Hartmann made it out safe!

00:20:33.483 --> 00:20:34.984 position:50% align:center
[BARKHORN]

00:20:35.068 --> 00:20:37.404 position:50% align:center

00:20:39.197 --> 00:20:39.948 position:50% align:center
Uh-oh.

00:20:40.031 --> 00:20:43.076 position:50% align:center
[screams]

00:20:50.291 --> 00:20:51.584 position:50% align:center
Took ya long enough!

00:20:51.668 --> 00:20:52.961 position:50% align:center
You oversleep?

00:20:53.044 --> 00:20:55.005 position:50% align:center
That's rich, coming from you.

00:20:55.088 --> 00:20:57.340 position:50% align:center
[HARTMANN giggles]

00:20:57.424 --> 00:20:59.467 position:50% align:center

--Hungry?
--[HARTMANN] Aw, heck yeah!

00:21:09.561 --> 00:21:11.938 position:50% align:center
Lucky me!

00:21:12.022 --> 00:21:13.940 position:50% align:center
You threw away your
weapons to be lighter,

00:21:14.024 --> 00:21:16.568 position:50% align:center
but you held onto
the chocolate bar?

00:21:16.651 --> 00:21:17.694 position:50% align:center
Is that true?

00:21:17.777 --> 00:21:19.154 position:50% align:center
What? 'Course not,

00:21:19.237 --> 00:21:22.323 position:50% align:center
that just happened
to be in my top.

00:21:22.407 --> 00:21:23.366 position:50% align:center
[HARTMANN giggles]

00:21:23.450 --> 00:21:24.951 position:50% align:center
Oh, that reminds me, Hartmann.

00:21:25.035 --> 00:21:26.661 position:50% align:center
I bet your radio
wasn't working, huh?

00:21:26.745 --> 00:21:30.832 position:50% align:center
[HARTMANN]
Oh, uh. Well, actually...

00:21:30.915 --> 00:21:32.584 position:50% align:center
Barkhorn said
something really sweet

00:21:32.667 --> 00:21:34.127 position:50% align:center
and I just wanted to
make sure you knew, so--

00:21:34.210 --> 00:21:37.630 position:50% align:center
[BARKHORN yells, laughs]

00:21:37.714 --> 00:21:39.257 position:50% align:center
It's nothing. She's kidding.

00:21:39.341 --> 00:21:42.177 position:50% align:center
You didn't hear us, did you?

00:21:42.260 --> 00:21:45.305 position:50% align:center
[HARTMANN giggles]
Not a word.

00:21:45.388 --> 00:21:47.265 position:50% align:center
My radio was busted.

00:21:47.349 --> 00:21:51.227 position:50% align:center
You didn't miss anything!
No worries! All good!

00:21:51.311 --> 00:21:52.896 position:50% align:center
[HARTMANN giggles]

00:21:54.272 --> 00:21:56.608 position:50% align:center
[HARTMANN]
Ooh! The chocolate's all melty!

00:21:56.691 --> 00:21:58.234 position:50% align:center
[BARKHORN]
Stop flailing around!

00:21:58.318 --> 00:22:01.196 position:50% align:center
[HARTMANN laughs]

00:23:35.415 --> 00:23:38.460 position:50% align:center
[FRANCESCA] Boobs go
jiggly-wiggly, jiggly wiggly.

00:23:38.543 --> 00:23:41.046 position:50% align:center
[laughing] Boing-boing!

00:23:41.129 --> 00:23:43.882 position:50% align:center
[EILA] Sanya! What happened
to your breasts?

00:23:43.965 --> 00:23:47.052 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIKA] On the next <i>Strike</i>
<i>Witches</i> : "They Go Boing-Boing"!
