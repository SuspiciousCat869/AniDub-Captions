00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:18.435 position:50% align:center
We've almost made it to Kiel.

00:00:18.518 --> 00:00:19.686 position:50% align:center
Thanks to Sanya and Eila,

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:22.105 position:50% align:center
it didn't suffer
much damage, either.

00:00:22.188 --> 00:00:24.190 position:50% align:center
Next stop, Berlin!

00:00:24.274 --> 00:00:26.192 position:50% align:center
So General Patton
sent his men in,

00:00:26.276 --> 00:00:28.361 position:50% align:center
and they'll be waiting at Kiel?

00:00:28.445 --> 00:00:29.529 position:50% align:center
Correct.

00:00:29.612 --> 00:00:31.781 position:50% align:center
Operation Southwind
will begin swiftly.

00:00:31.865 --> 00:00:33.408 position:50% align:center
They're itching for a fight.

00:00:33.491 --> 00:00:36.286 position:50% align:center
Well, that nest in Berlin
isn't going to destroy itself.

00:00:36.369 --> 00:00:39.289 position:50% align:center
Can you imagine how big the core
in that thing is gonna be?

00:00:39.372 --> 00:00:41.791 position:50% align:center
Yeah, and I wanna crush it
with my own two hands.

00:00:41.875 --> 00:00:42.792 position:50% align:center
Same.

00:00:42.876 --> 00:00:44.753 position:50% align:center
As Karlslandians,
it's our right.

00:00:44.836 --> 00:00:46.463 position:50% align:center
You two are fired up
about this, huh?

00:00:46.546 --> 00:00:49.007 position:50% align:center
Yeah, so you had better not
sleep through the mission.

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:50.925 position:50% align:center
Hey, I got up on time today!

00:00:51.009 --> 00:00:52.927 position:50% align:center
That's because I woke
you up four times!

00:00:53.011 --> 00:00:54.763 position:50% align:center
[immitates buzzer]
Five times, actually.

00:00:54.846 --> 00:00:56.264 position:50% align:center
This isn't a quiz!

00:00:56.348 --> 00:00:57.349 position:50% align:center
And we were late for the meeting

00:00:57.432 --> 00:00:59.392 position:50% align:center
with General Patton
because of you!

00:00:59.476 --> 00:01:01.603 position:50% align:center
Minna, back me up here!

00:01:01.686 --> 00:01:02.437 position:50% align:center
[MINNA grunts]

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.856 position:50% align:center
Hey, are you all right?

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:07.776 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I'm sorry.
Just lost in thought.

00:01:07.859 --> 00:01:09.694 position:50% align:center
Let's hurry.

00:01:09.778 --> 00:01:11.279 position:50% align:center
Roger!

00:01:11.363 --> 00:01:12.739 position:50% align:center
Minna.

00:02:52.922 --> 00:02:56.551 position:50% align:center
[HARTMANN]
Wow! Check out all those tanks!

00:02:56.634 --> 00:02:58.011 position:50% align:center
[BARKHORN]
With an army this size,

00:02:58.094 --> 00:02:59.971 position:50% align:center
the Neuroi don't stand a chance.

00:03:00.055 --> 00:03:02.098 position:50% align:center
I'll have to thank Liberion.

00:03:02.182 --> 00:03:05.143 position:50% align:center
If only we'd had this
strength five years ago.

00:03:05.226 --> 00:03:07.020 position:50% align:center
There's no point
in feeling regret.

00:03:07.103 --> 00:03:08.646 position:50% align:center
We must look forward.

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.273 position:50% align:center
That's true enough.

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:20.533 position:50% align:center
[PATTON] Ladies! Nice work
gettin' Kiel back for us!

00:03:20.617 --> 00:03:22.077 position:50% align:center
Just doing our jobs, sir.

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:23.953 position:50% align:center
We'll handle the rest.

00:03:24.037 --> 00:03:27.791 position:50% align:center
And quickly; we're startin' the
march on Berlin any minute now.

00:03:27.874 --> 00:03:28.750 position:50% align:center
You're what?

00:03:28.833 --> 00:03:30.335 position:50% align:center
You mean literally now?

00:03:30.418 --> 00:03:31.503 position:50% align:center
And why not?

00:03:31.586 --> 00:03:33.421 position:50% align:center
It's a straight shot
to Berlin, ain't it?

00:03:33.505 --> 00:03:35.590 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:03:35.674 --> 00:03:38.134 position:50% align:center
How are you going to deal
with the giant Neuroi nest?

00:03:38.218 --> 00:03:40.303 position:50% align:center
With firepower of course!

00:03:40.387 --> 00:03:42.806 position:50% align:center
We're gonna blow
those suckers away!

00:03:42.889 --> 00:03:45.183 position:50% align:center
All right, boys,
let's move out!

00:03:47.644 --> 00:03:49.437 position:50% align:center
[BARKHORN] I didn't wanna
rain on his parade,

00:03:49.521 --> 00:03:51.648 position:50% align:center
but how do you destroy
a nest from the ground?

00:03:51.731 --> 00:03:54.109 position:50% align:center
[HARTMANN]
I don't think you can.

00:03:54.192 --> 00:03:55.985 position:50% align:center
[URSULA]
Erica!

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:57.195 position:50% align:center
[HARTMANN]
Hey!

00:03:57.278 --> 00:04:00.865 position:50% align:center
Guys, it's Ursula! Hi, sis!

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:03.118 position:50% align:center
It's been quite
some time, hasn't it?

00:04:03.201 --> 00:04:05.036 position:50% align:center
I know! What are you doing here?

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:06.746 position:50% align:center
If you've come to
observe the battle ahead,

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:09.082 position:50% align:center
you should know that it
won't be an easy one.

00:04:09.165 --> 00:04:10.417 position:50% align:center
Of course. That's
why I've brought

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:11.960 position:50% align:center
some inventions for you.

00:04:12.043 --> 00:04:14.963 position:50% align:center
[sighs] They're gonna
be weird aren't they?

00:04:15.046 --> 00:04:16.923 position:50% align:center
Now why would you say that?

00:04:19.634 --> 00:04:21.344 position:50% align:center
[HARTMANN]
In these boxes here?

00:04:21.428 --> 00:04:22.971 position:50% align:center
Uh-huh.

00:04:23.054 --> 00:04:24.180 position:50% align:center
The Helmet Gun.

00:04:24.264 --> 00:04:27.225 position:50% align:center
A normal helmet,
except it has a gun.

00:04:27.308 --> 00:04:28.768 position:50% align:center
The Midair Sound Amp.

00:04:28.852 --> 00:04:30.854 position:50% align:center
It makes a Witch's
already-amplified hearing

00:04:30.937 --> 00:04:32.731 position:50% align:center
even more powerful.

00:04:32.814 --> 00:04:34.691 position:50% align:center
And this is the
Panzerfaust 250.

00:04:34.774 --> 00:04:36.443 position:50% align:center
A surface to surface
rocket launcher.

00:04:36.526 --> 00:04:37.944 position:50% align:center
They're all weird!

00:04:38.028 --> 00:04:40.238 position:50% align:center
[BARKHORN] No, the last one
is pretty awesome.

00:04:40.321 --> 00:04:41.531 position:50% align:center
Uh...

00:04:41.614 --> 00:04:43.158 position:50% align:center
--[explosion]
--[BOTH gasp]

00:04:43.241 --> 00:04:44.367 position:50% align:center
[BARKHORN]
What happened?

00:04:44.451 --> 00:04:46.119 position:50% align:center
[URSULA] Weren't the
tanks going that way?

00:04:46.202 --> 00:04:48.038 position:50% align:center
The general! No!

00:04:51.041 --> 00:04:52.000 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKA]
Welcome back!

00:04:52.083 --> 00:04:53.460 position:50% align:center
That sure was fast!

00:04:53.543 --> 00:04:55.420 position:50% align:center
So, did the meeting
go all right?

00:04:55.503 --> 00:04:57.756 position:50% align:center
We've got a new complication.

00:04:58.923 --> 00:05:02.385 position:50% align:center
[PATTON] Those Neuroi bastards!
They came outta nowhere!

00:05:02.469 --> 00:05:04.512 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIER 309A] General Patton,
please calm down!

00:05:04.596 --> 00:05:07.390 position:50% align:center
I'm glad the general's safe,
but that was pretty nuts.

00:05:07.474 --> 00:05:10.060 position:50% align:center
So the Neuroi just slammed
itself right into them?

00:05:10.143 --> 00:05:11.227 position:50% align:center
We think so, yes.

00:05:11.311 --> 00:05:12.562 position:50% align:center
If they've figured out
what we're after,

00:05:12.645 --> 00:05:14.230 position:50% align:center
they're probably
desperate to stop us

00:05:14.314 --> 00:05:15.607 position:50% align:center
before we gain any ground.

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:16.775 position:50% align:center
It's gonna be bad

00:05:16.858 --> 00:05:18.443 position:50% align:center
if they attack like
that again, though.

00:05:18.526 --> 00:05:19.861 position:50% align:center
[alarm blares]

00:05:19.944 --> 00:05:21.696 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIER 309B] Emergency
communication from our scouts!

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:23.406 position:50% align:center
A high-speed Neuroi
is heading to Kiel

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:25.408 position:50% align:center
from the direction of Berlin!

00:05:25.492 --> 00:05:26.242 position:50% align:center
Aw, jeez.

00:05:26.326 --> 00:05:27.243 position:50% align:center
The same tactic?

00:05:27.327 --> 00:05:28.912 position:50% align:center
Either way, we're launching!

00:05:28.995 --> 00:05:30.121 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKA]
Roger!

00:05:30.205 --> 00:05:31.998 position:50% align:center
Actually, you should
hold off on the launch!

00:05:32.082 --> 00:05:33.375 position:50% align:center
And why's that?

00:05:33.458 --> 00:05:35.377 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIKA] The Neuroi has
already finished its attack.

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:38.630 position:50% align:center
--[BARKHORN] What?
--[HARTMANN] That sure was fast!

00:05:38.713 --> 00:05:40.757 position:50% align:center
[MINNA] All right, let's review
the information we have

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:44.052 position:50% align:center
about the high-speed Neuroi
that attacked our troops.

00:05:46.429 --> 00:05:50.308 position:50% align:center
[MINNA] As you know, this is
Wolf, the nest over Berlin.

00:05:50.392 --> 00:05:52.644 position:50% align:center
But something's changed.

00:05:52.727 --> 00:05:53.812 position:50% align:center
See the top?

00:05:53.895 --> 00:05:56.106 position:50% align:center
This image was captured
by our recon team,

00:05:56.189 --> 00:05:57.649 position:50% align:center
though they couldn't get close.

00:05:57.732 --> 00:05:59.442 position:50% align:center
Why'd it turn red?

00:05:59.526 --> 00:06:01.569 position:50% align:center
[MINNA]
Now, when we zoom in,

00:06:01.653 --> 00:06:04.072 position:50% align:center
you can see an object
departing right here.

00:06:04.155 --> 00:06:05.198 position:50% align:center
But what could it be?

00:06:05.281 --> 00:06:06.533 position:50% align:center
A projectile?

00:06:06.616 --> 00:06:08.618 position:50% align:center
Oh, so those surprise
attacks we got hit with

00:06:08.702 --> 00:06:10.286 position:50% align:center
came from the nest itself?

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:12.789 position:50% align:center
That's right. It launches
rocket-type Neuroi.

00:06:12.872 --> 00:06:17.419 position:50% align:center
The first landed four kilometers
to the southeast of Kiel.

00:06:17.502 --> 00:06:20.380 position:50% align:center
The second landed even closer
to the city than the first.

00:06:20.463 --> 00:06:22.716 position:50% align:center
If they continue like this,
they'll eventually destroy

00:06:22.799 --> 00:06:25.552 position:50% align:center
the port and delay
our assault on Berlin.

00:06:25.635 --> 00:06:27.012 position:50% align:center
According to the recon team,

00:06:27.095 --> 00:06:29.472 position:50% align:center
120 seconds after
the cloud turns red,

00:06:29.556 --> 00:06:31.850 position:50% align:center
a new rocket-type
Neuroi is launched.

00:06:31.933 --> 00:06:33.643 position:50% align:center
This occurs once a day.

00:06:33.727 --> 00:06:35.270 position:50% align:center
The top of the nest, huh?

00:06:35.353 --> 00:06:37.272 position:50% align:center
That'll be a tough
area to target.

00:06:37.355 --> 00:06:40.483 position:50% align:center
Get too close, and we'll be
swarmed by Neuroi for sure.

00:06:40.567 --> 00:06:42.235 position:50% align:center
So what do we do?

00:06:42.318 --> 00:06:44.070 position:50% align:center
When the nest
launches the rocket,

00:06:44.154 --> 00:06:46.281 position:50% align:center
it should travel
upwards at first.

00:06:46.364 --> 00:06:47.574 position:50% align:center
[MINNA]
Correct. Then it uses

00:06:47.657 --> 00:06:49.826 position:50% align:center
its potential energy
to accelerate.

00:06:49.909 --> 00:06:52.912 position:50% align:center
When it hits, it's moving faster
than the speed of sound.

00:06:52.996 --> 00:06:56.082 position:50% align:center
In other words, way too fast
for our Striker Units to catch.

00:06:56.166 --> 00:06:58.752 position:50% align:center
What? Then how are we
s'pposed to beat it?

00:06:58.835 --> 00:07:01.880 position:50% align:center
We'll hit it right before it
switches from climb to dive.

00:07:01.963 --> 00:07:03.465 position:50% align:center
Right here.

00:07:03.548 --> 00:07:05.133 position:50% align:center
It's our only chance.

00:07:05.216 --> 00:07:07.886 position:50% align:center
I see. But that's a
limited time and space.

00:07:07.969 --> 00:07:10.430 position:50% align:center
Plus, we'd have to get there
before the Neuroi does.

00:07:10.513 --> 00:07:13.058 position:50% align:center
Can we use rocket boosters,
like Sanya and I did?

00:07:13.141 --> 00:07:15.060 position:50% align:center
That might even
the playing field a bit.

00:07:15.143 --> 00:07:18.063 position:50% align:center
That would work once, but
the enemy attacks every day.

00:07:18.146 --> 00:07:20.690 position:50% align:center
No thank you, I was
sore and stiff for ages

00:07:20.774 --> 00:07:22.817 position:50% align:center
after we did that
trick last time.

00:07:22.901 --> 00:07:24.069 position:50% align:center
A jet's no good?

00:07:24.152 --> 00:07:25.779 position:50% align:center
It'd take too long
to accelerate.

00:07:25.862 --> 00:07:27.155 position:50% align:center
By the time we reach top speed,

00:07:27.238 --> 00:07:29.407 position:50% align:center
the Neuroi will have
already hit its target.

00:07:29.491 --> 00:07:32.118 position:50% align:center
So we need a Striker Unit
with super-high acceleration

00:07:32.202 --> 00:07:35.288 position:50% align:center
that can match the rocket's
speed without using boosters.

00:07:35.372 --> 00:07:36.581 position:50% align:center
Does that even exist?

00:07:36.664 --> 00:07:39.376 position:50% align:center
I don't think my P51-H
can pull that off.

00:07:39.459 --> 00:07:40.585 position:50% align:center
Let me help you.

00:07:40.669 --> 00:07:41.670 position:50% align:center
[HARTMANN]
Ursula?

00:07:41.753 --> 00:07:44.381 position:50% align:center
[MINNA]
Do you know a unit we could use?

00:07:44.464 --> 00:07:47.717 position:50% align:center
The ME-163 Komet.

00:07:47.801 --> 00:07:49.969 position:50% align:center
[HARTMANN]
And this is it?

00:07:50.053 --> 00:07:52.138 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKA]
It has a strange shape.

00:07:52.222 --> 00:07:54.474 position:50% align:center
[URSULA] It has a unique
engine that uses a fuel mix

00:07:54.557 --> 00:07:57.394 position:50% align:center
of magic power and
high-density ether.

00:07:57.477 --> 00:07:58.353 position:50% align:center
Ah!

00:07:58.436 --> 00:08:00.230 position:50% align:center
That seems sane enough.

00:08:00.313 --> 00:08:01.898 position:50% align:center
[URSULA]
Its acceleration and top speed

00:08:01.981 --> 00:08:03.233 position:50% align:center
should provide exactly--

00:08:03.316 --> 00:08:04.442 position:50% align:center
[FRANCESCA screams]

00:08:04.526 --> 00:08:06.528 position:50% align:center
My undies got wet!

00:08:08.071 --> 00:08:10.115 position:50% align:center
[FRANCESCA yelps]
Shirley! It ate my clothes!

00:08:10.198 --> 00:08:13.576 position:50% align:center
Aw, there, there.
I'll protect you.

00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:15.995 position:50% align:center
[URSULA] It's volatile
enough to melt clothing.

00:08:16.079 --> 00:08:17.122 position:50% align:center
Please be careful.

00:08:17.205 --> 00:08:18.998 position:50% align:center
You could've told
us that before!

00:08:19.082 --> 00:08:21.251 position:50% align:center
My fault for thinking
it would be normal.

00:08:21.334 --> 00:08:22.502 position:50% align:center
No thanks!

00:08:22.585 --> 00:08:24.754 position:50% align:center
This thing is way too
dangerous for us to use!

00:08:24.838 --> 00:08:27.007 position:50% align:center
Huh. Well if you ask me,
speed and danger

00:08:27.090 --> 00:08:28.425 position:50% align:center
are a match made in heaven!

00:08:28.508 --> 00:08:30.635 position:50% align:center
This is a job for yours truly!

00:08:30.719 --> 00:08:32.846 position:50% align:center
[BARKHORN] You just want
an excuse to go fast.

00:08:32.929 --> 00:08:33.847 position:50% align:center
[SHIRLEY]
Huh?

00:08:33.930 --> 00:08:35.098 position:50% align:center
[FRANCESCA]
Make Hartmann do it.

00:08:35.181 --> 00:08:37.726 position:50% align:center
She's her twin.

00:08:37.809 --> 00:08:38.893 position:50% align:center
[MINNA]
Leave it to me.

00:08:38.977 --> 00:08:42.480 position:50% align:center
[ALL gasp]

00:08:42.564 --> 00:08:44.357 position:50% align:center
[URSULA]
Let's begin the test flight.

00:08:44.441 --> 00:08:47.694 position:50% align:center
Your target is
this pencil rocket.

00:08:47.777 --> 00:08:50.989 position:50% align:center
You'll train until you can
catch up and destroy it.

00:08:51.072 --> 00:08:52.365 position:50% align:center
Roger that!

00:08:55.785 --> 00:08:57.037 position:50% align:center
[URSULA]
Launching.

00:09:08.214 --> 00:09:11.801 position:50% align:center
The acceleration is insane;
I can barely keep steady!

00:09:11.885 --> 00:09:13.511 position:50% align:center
[EILA]
Awfully cloudy today.

00:09:13.595 --> 00:09:16.348 position:50% align:center
That's true but it's nothing
her spatial awareness magic

00:09:16.431 --> 00:09:18.016 position:50% align:center
can't overcome.

00:09:20.935 --> 00:09:25.857 position:50% align:center
[MINNA] Grid H5546 to T8447.
Right over there!

00:09:35.825 --> 00:09:36.743 position:50% align:center
[LYNNE]
Wow.

00:09:36.826 --> 00:09:38.453 position:50% align:center
[BARKHORN]
That's Minna for you.

00:09:38.536 --> 00:09:40.288 position:50% align:center
[whistles]

00:09:45.710 --> 00:09:51.299 position:50% align:center
[MINNA panting]

00:09:51.383 --> 00:09:53.760 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIKA] Are you okay?
Did something happen up there?

00:09:53.843 --> 00:09:55.178 position:50% align:center
She can barely stand!

00:09:55.261 --> 00:09:57.138 position:50% align:center
Why did you make her
use this thing, Ursula?

00:09:57.222 --> 00:09:58.973 position:50% align:center
If it eats up magic
power like a jet,

00:09:59.057 --> 00:10:00.892 position:50% align:center
you should have told us
in the first place.

00:10:00.975 --> 00:10:03.186 position:50% align:center
It doesn't. Thanks to
the unique fuel mix,

00:10:03.269 --> 00:10:04.813 position:50% align:center
it shouldn't take up
any more magic

00:10:04.896 --> 00:10:06.564 position:50% align:center
than a regular Striker Unit.

00:10:06.648 --> 00:10:08.400 position:50% align:center
I just lost my balance a bit.

00:10:08.483 --> 00:10:09.943 position:50% align:center
And Ursula is correct.

00:10:10.026 --> 00:10:11.695 position:50% align:center
You're sure?

00:10:11.778 --> 00:10:13.113 position:50% align:center
Yes, the plan works.

00:10:13.196 --> 00:10:16.032 position:50% align:center
And I'm clearly the most
qualified Witch to carry it out.

00:10:34.134 --> 00:10:35.927 position:50% align:center
I hope you like
what I made today!

00:10:36.011 --> 00:10:39.180 position:50% align:center
Ah! Miyafuji's onigiri
and miso soup!

00:10:39.264 --> 00:10:41.224 position:50% align:center
Oh, how I've longed for you!

00:10:41.307 --> 00:10:43.476 position:50% align:center
Jeez! You couldn't wait?

00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:45.311 position:50% align:center
It's yummy!

00:10:45.395 --> 00:10:46.813 position:50% align:center
The grilled salmon's
a nice touch.

00:10:46.896 --> 00:10:48.023 position:50% align:center
[giggles]

00:10:48.106 --> 00:10:51.109 position:50% align:center
You guys seen Minna?
Is she not coming?

00:10:51.192 --> 00:10:53.236 position:50% align:center
She said she would eat later.

00:11:05.582 --> 00:11:06.750 position:50% align:center
[BARKHORN]
Minna.

00:11:06.833 --> 00:11:08.251 position:50% align:center
I think we need to talk.

00:11:08.335 --> 00:11:10.503 position:50% align:center
Sorry, there's not
enough room for two.

00:11:10.587 --> 00:11:12.213 position:50% align:center
This mission worries me.

00:11:12.297 --> 00:11:16.009 position:50% align:center
[sighs] I told you.
I lost my balance, is all.

00:11:16.092 --> 00:11:17.635 position:50% align:center
[BARKHORN] Or you're
losing your magic power

00:11:17.719 --> 00:11:19.888 position:50% align:center
and you're trying
to hide it from us.

00:11:22.307 --> 00:11:23.808 position:50% align:center
I thought as much.

00:11:23.892 --> 00:11:26.603 position:50% align:center
Look, I'm all right.
I can fly just fine.

00:11:26.686 --> 00:11:28.355 position:50% align:center
Minna, please let me take over.

00:11:28.438 --> 00:11:30.857 position:50% align:center
A commander can't put herself
in danger like this.

00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:33.026 position:50% align:center
Could anyone else keep
the Komet under control

00:11:33.109 --> 00:11:35.028 position:50% align:center
while tracking a
high-speed target?

00:11:35.111 --> 00:11:36.571 position:50% align:center
Could you accomplish that?

00:11:36.654 --> 00:11:38.948 position:50% align:center
Of course, and that goes
for the others as well!

00:11:39.032 --> 00:11:40.533 position:50% align:center
We'd just need proper training.

00:11:40.617 --> 00:11:42.285 position:50% align:center
[MINNA]
There's no time for that!

00:11:42.369 --> 00:11:45.038 position:50% align:center
It will be catastrophic
if that Neuroi hits Kiel.

00:11:45.121 --> 00:11:48.750 position:50% align:center
Our entire operation
will be sidelined.

00:11:48.833 --> 00:11:50.794 position:50% align:center
I'm the only one who can do it!

00:11:50.877 --> 00:11:52.128 position:50% align:center
It's now or never!

00:11:52.212 --> 00:11:53.672 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:11:55.298 --> 00:11:57.050 position:50% align:center
[alarm blares]

00:11:57.133 --> 00:11:58.760 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIER 309B] The rocket-type
Neuroi just struck

00:11:58.843 --> 00:12:01.054 position:50% align:center
three kilometers
southeast of Kiel.

00:12:01.137 --> 00:12:02.305 position:50% align:center
Damage is unknown.

00:12:02.389 --> 00:12:04.015 position:50% align:center
There's the third one.

00:12:23.368 --> 00:12:25.662 position:50% align:center
[MINNA] This is where the
third attack landed earlier.

00:12:25.745 --> 00:12:27.247 position:50% align:center
Our predictions were correct.

00:12:27.330 --> 00:12:29.290 position:50% align:center
Soon enough, they'll hit Kiel.

00:12:29.374 --> 00:12:31.251 position:50% align:center
We have to take action soon.

00:12:31.334 --> 00:12:34.129 position:50% align:center
Unfortunately, the Komet can't
remain in the air for long,

00:12:34.212 --> 00:12:35.839 position:50% align:center
so we won't be able
to hover in range

00:12:35.922 --> 00:12:37.507 position:50% align:center
and wait for the
enemy to launch.

00:12:37.590 --> 00:12:39.551 position:50% align:center
So we should take action
after the top of the nest

00:12:39.634 --> 00:12:41.011 position:50% align:center
turns red, is that right?

00:12:41.094 --> 00:12:43.596 position:50% align:center
We wouldn't make it to the
interception point in time.

00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:47.767 position:50% align:center
We need to get closer to the
nest before we start waiting.

00:12:47.851 --> 00:12:50.270 position:50% align:center
Our best bet is to use this
section of the Autobahn

00:12:50.353 --> 00:12:51.521 position:50% align:center
as our launch point.

00:12:51.604 --> 00:12:54.149 position:50% align:center
We're really going that
close to the nest?

00:12:54.232 --> 00:12:57.027 position:50% align:center
If we're that audacious
about it, won't they notice us?

00:12:57.110 --> 00:12:58.486 position:50% align:center
Not if we go by land.

00:12:58.570 --> 00:12:59.904 position:50% align:center
And we'll travel at night.

00:12:59.988 --> 00:13:01.865 position:50% align:center
If we're careful and keep
our numbers to a minimum,

00:13:01.948 --> 00:13:03.616 position:50% align:center
the enemy won't likely see us.

00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:06.202 position:50% align:center
Obviously you'll be part of
the team, but who's with you?

00:13:06.286 --> 00:13:07.287 position:50% align:center
You can count me in.

00:13:07.370 --> 00:13:08.663 position:50% align:center
And me, too!

00:13:08.747 --> 00:13:10.457 position:50% align:center
Your magic hasn't recovered
from your last mission.

00:13:10.540 --> 00:13:11.958 position:50% align:center
Are you sure this is smart?

00:13:12.042 --> 00:13:13.126 position:50% align:center
Well, I...

00:13:13.209 --> 00:13:15.003 position:50% align:center
You need a driver
for the truck, right?

00:13:15.086 --> 00:13:16.546 position:50% align:center
Might as well be me.

00:13:16.629 --> 00:13:17.839 position:50% align:center
Then it's settled.

00:13:17.922 --> 00:13:19.883 position:50% align:center
And we can have Ursula
go along as our mechanic.

00:13:19.966 --> 00:13:21.134 position:50% align:center
Roger.

00:13:21.217 --> 00:13:23.470 position:50% align:center
We'll be heading
out tonight, ladies.

00:13:33.229 --> 00:13:34.147 position:50% align:center
Everything ready?

00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:35.523 position:50% align:center
Uh-huh.

00:13:37.233 --> 00:13:39.819 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIKA]
Good luck, you guys!

00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:48.703 position:50% align:center
[URSULA]
Neuroi recon units.

00:13:48.787 --> 00:13:51.289 position:50% align:center
Seems going by land
was the right call.

00:13:52.707 --> 00:13:53.625 position:50% align:center
Minna!

00:13:53.708 --> 00:13:54.876 position:50% align:center
Shh!

00:13:57.128 --> 00:13:58.254 position:50% align:center
They're gone now.

00:13:58.338 --> 00:13:59.798 position:50% align:center
What is it, Hartmann?

00:13:59.881 --> 00:14:02.092 position:50% align:center
They witnessed a fourth attack
from the rocket-type Neuroi.

00:14:02.175 --> 00:14:04.344 position:50% align:center
One kilometer south of Kiel!

00:14:04.427 --> 00:14:06.763 position:50% align:center
That means the next one
will hit the city, then.

00:14:06.846 --> 00:14:09.224 position:50% align:center
We need to hurry
to the launch point.

00:14:09.307 --> 00:14:12.268 position:50% align:center
Let's stay cool. If we
move now, they'll find us.

00:14:12.352 --> 00:14:15.647 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Can't believe you're
the one telling me to calm down.

00:14:15.730 --> 00:14:18.483 position:50% align:center
Well, what can I say?
We all have our moments.

00:14:20.568 --> 00:14:23.279 position:50% align:center
Bleh. I hate rye bread.
It's so tough!

00:14:23.363 --> 00:14:24.989 position:50% align:center
[URSULA] Let's show
a little tolerance, okay?

00:14:25.073 --> 00:14:26.908 position:50% align:center
Once we freed Antwerpen,
I thought for sure

00:14:26.991 --> 00:14:29.869 position:50% align:center
we would be storming Berlin
in no time at all,

00:14:29.953 --> 00:14:31.996 position:50% align:center
but nothing is ever
that easy, is it?

00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:33.707 position:50% align:center
We're almost there
now, aren't we?

00:14:33.790 --> 00:14:36.710 position:50% align:center
Yep, yep! 'Cause everyone's
been working so hard!

00:14:36.793 --> 00:14:38.294 position:50% align:center
You're right.

00:14:38.378 --> 00:14:42.215 position:50% align:center
I can't thank the members of the
501st enough for their efforts.

00:14:42.298 --> 00:14:44.467 position:50% align:center
What a ride.

00:14:44.551 --> 00:14:46.636 position:50% align:center
[HARTMANN] Bleh!
This coffee is so bitter!

00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:48.054 position:50% align:center
Because it's not real coffee.

00:14:48.138 --> 00:14:50.181 position:50% align:center
It's actually made
from dandelion root.

00:14:50.265 --> 00:14:52.809 position:50% align:center
Well, that's stupid--
I want real coffee!

00:14:52.892 --> 00:14:55.270 position:50% align:center
[MINNA] I have some.
But it's back in my room.

00:14:55.353 --> 00:14:57.313 position:50% align:center
[HARTMANN] Aw, what?
Why didn't you bring it?

00:14:57.397 --> 00:14:59.566 position:50% align:center
[laughs] How about this?

00:14:59.649 --> 00:15:01.776 position:50% align:center
I'll make you some
once we return to base.

00:15:01.860 --> 00:15:04.404 position:50% align:center
Don't make promises!
You'll bring us bad luck!

00:15:04.487 --> 00:15:07.032 position:50% align:center
It'll be fine!
Just another mission.

00:15:07.115 --> 00:15:11.244 position:50% align:center
And as a treat, once we take
Berlin, we can all go to a café.

00:15:11.327 --> 00:15:12.245 position:50% align:center
With cake?

00:15:12.328 --> 00:15:13.079 position:50% align:center
Certainly.

00:15:13.163 --> 00:15:15.540 position:50% align:center
[HARTMANN]
Yippee!

00:15:39.481 --> 00:15:42.067 position:50% align:center
We should be close to
the nest any minute now.

00:15:51.034 --> 00:15:53.495 position:50% align:center
This should be a
perfect spot to launch.

00:15:56.664 --> 00:15:58.041 position:50% align:center
[BARKHORN]
Wolf.

00:15:58.124 --> 00:16:01.044 position:50% align:center
[URSULA] The enemy isn't
preparing an attack just yet.

00:16:01.127 --> 00:16:03.296 position:50% align:center
So far, this has gone
according to plan.

00:16:03.380 --> 00:16:05.256 position:50% align:center
Let's set everything up now.

00:16:11.721 --> 00:16:12.847 position:50% align:center
[MINNA]
How much longer?

00:16:12.931 --> 00:16:15.225 position:50% align:center
The fuel's almost
loaded. One second.

00:16:15.308 --> 00:16:17.268 position:50% align:center
The observation team
estimates we have at least

00:16:17.352 --> 00:16:20.563 position:50% align:center
an hour till the next
Neuroi launch. We'll make it.

00:16:20.647 --> 00:16:22.399 position:50% align:center
They what? And you confirmed it?

00:16:22.482 --> 00:16:23.525 position:50% align:center
What's the matter?

00:16:23.608 --> 00:16:25.026 position:50% align:center
The top of the nest
has changed color!

00:16:25.110 --> 00:16:25.902 position:50% align:center
And it's about to attack!

00:16:25.985 --> 00:16:27.320 position:50% align:center
What?

00:16:28.530 --> 00:16:30.824 position:50% align:center
[HARTMANN] She's right!
It turned bright red!

00:16:30.907 --> 00:16:32.283 position:50% align:center
They can speed up the launch?

00:16:32.367 --> 00:16:35.036 position:50% align:center
Maybe the enemy noticed
us on the way over here.

00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:36.287 position:50% align:center
Is the fuel loaded?

00:16:36.371 --> 00:16:38.415 position:50% align:center
Not yet. Ninety seconds.

00:16:38.498 --> 00:16:39.457 position:50% align:center
That's way too tight.

00:16:39.541 --> 00:16:40.792 position:50% align:center
And I got more bad news!

00:16:40.875 --> 00:16:41.918 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:16:42.002 --> 00:16:43.753 position:50% align:center
There's a Neuroi coming
straight for us!

00:16:43.837 --> 00:16:45.296 position:50% align:center
Looks like one of
the super-fast ones,

00:16:45.380 --> 00:16:47.298 position:50% align:center
like we fought back at Hamburg!

00:16:55.098 --> 00:16:56.307 position:50% align:center
Gimme a break!

00:16:56.391 --> 00:16:57.392 position:50% align:center
How much longer?

00:16:57.475 --> 00:16:58.727 position:50% align:center
One minute!

00:16:58.810 --> 00:17:01.438 position:50% align:center
We gotta intercept it!
Hartmann, it's time to go!

00:17:01.521 --> 00:17:03.398 position:50% align:center
Roger that!

00:17:03.481 --> 00:17:05.191 position:50% align:center
Be careful!

00:17:05.275 --> 00:17:07.152 position:50% align:center
[BARKHORN]
We'll protect Minna!

00:17:13.658 --> 00:17:15.410 position:50% align:center
These guys are a massive pain!

00:17:15.493 --> 00:17:16.828 position:50% align:center
I got you!

00:17:18.872 --> 00:17:19.622 position:50% align:center
No!

00:17:19.706 --> 00:17:20.623 position:50% align:center
[BARKHORN]
It slipped past!

00:17:20.707 --> 00:17:22.292 position:50% align:center
Thirty seconds left!

00:17:23.376 --> 00:17:24.502 position:50% align:center
Oh, no!

00:17:25.837 --> 00:17:27.547 position:50% align:center
[yelps]

00:17:27.630 --> 00:17:29.591 position:50% align:center
Ursula, no!

00:17:29.674 --> 00:17:30.842 position:50% align:center
How's the Komet?

00:17:30.925 --> 00:17:34.095 position:50% align:center
No need to worry.
It's safe, thanks to you.

00:17:37.057 --> 00:17:39.184 position:50% align:center
[HARTMANN]
Leave my sister alone!

00:17:42.228 --> 00:17:44.230 position:50% align:center
[BARKHORN]
Damn. It's too fast.

00:17:44.314 --> 00:17:45.815 position:50% align:center
What? Already?

00:17:52.489 --> 00:17:54.616 position:50% align:center
[URSULA]
Fuel charge complete.

00:17:54.699 --> 00:17:55.992 position:50% align:center
Hurry!

00:18:00.747 --> 00:18:01.581 position:50% align:center
[HARTMANN]
There it goes!

[BARKHORN gasps]

00:18:04.125 --> 00:18:05.418 position:50% align:center

H8542. T6613.

00:18:20.308 --> 00:18:21.601 position:50% align:center
[MINNA]
Gotcha!

00:18:25.814 --> 00:18:27.107 position:50% align:center
Down you go!

00:18:33.571 --> 00:18:37.492 position:50% align:center
[panting]

00:18:37.575 --> 00:18:39.452 position:50% align:center
Suck on this, you jerk!

00:18:51.756 --> 00:18:52.507 position:50% align:center
It worked!

00:18:52.590 --> 00:18:53.925 position:50% align:center
We nailed it!

00:18:58.638 --> 00:19:00.849 position:50% align:center
[MINNA]
Mission success. Heading back.

00:19:00.932 --> 00:19:02.017 position:50% align:center
[BARKHORN]
How's your fuel?

00:19:02.100 --> 00:19:03.101 position:50% align:center
[MINNA]
It's just fine.

00:19:03.184 --> 00:19:04.769 position:50% align:center
More than enough to get home.

00:19:04.853 --> 00:19:07.022 position:50% align:center
[sighs] I'm beat!

00:19:07.105 --> 00:19:08.982 position:50% align:center
Y'got any chocolate for me?

00:19:09.065 --> 00:19:10.567 position:50% align:center
After we get back to the base.

00:19:10.650 --> 00:19:11.735 position:50% align:center
What?

00:19:11.818 --> 00:19:13.862 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:19:25.832 --> 00:19:27.375 position:50% align:center
What the hell is it doing?

00:19:27.459 --> 00:19:28.835 position:50% align:center
--Huh?
--[BARKHORN] Is something up?

00:19:28.918 --> 00:19:30.712 position:50% align:center
Multiple rocket-type
Neuroi have emerged

00:19:30.795 --> 00:19:32.172 position:50% align:center
from inside of the nest!

00:19:32.255 --> 00:19:33.715 position:50% align:center
How did they do that?

00:19:33.798 --> 00:19:35.925 position:50% align:center
[MINNA] There's enough of them
to raze Kiel to the ground.

00:19:36.009 --> 00:19:37.344 position:50% align:center
I have to destroy them!

00:19:37.427 --> 00:19:39.554 position:50% align:center
You don't have enough fuel left!
You need to pull away!

00:19:39.637 --> 00:19:40.597 position:50% align:center
[HARTMANN]
If you run out,

00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:43.183 position:50% align:center
you'll fall straight
into the nest!

00:19:43.266 --> 00:19:45.643 position:50% align:center
[BARKHORN]
Are you listening?

00:19:45.727 --> 00:19:48.313 position:50% align:center
I have a job to do here.
Take care of the rest.

Minna, stop!

00:19:52.067 --> 00:19:53.777 position:50% align:center
No!

00:20:10.460 --> 00:20:12.879 position:50% align:center
[groans] A little more!

00:20:12.962 --> 00:20:15.215 position:50% align:center
Hang in there
just a little longer!

00:20:21.930 --> 00:20:23.932 position:50% align:center
[MINNA grunts]

00:20:32.482 --> 00:20:37.195 position:50% align:center
[panting] I got it.

00:20:45.453 --> 00:20:47.706 position:50% align:center
[MINNA]
I know I promised.

00:20:47.789 --> 00:20:49.708 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry.

00:20:49.791 --> 00:20:52.419 position:50% align:center
You'll be going home without me.

00:21:03.304 --> 00:21:04.097 position:50% align:center
[HARTMANN]
Minna!

00:21:04.180 --> 00:21:06.516 position:50% align:center
[gasps] You saved me.

00:21:06.599 --> 00:21:07.767 position:50% align:center
I'd given up.

00:21:07.851 --> 00:21:08.977 position:50% align:center
What's wrong with you?!

00:21:09.060 --> 00:21:11.479 position:50% align:center
You still owe Erica
that coffee, damn it!

00:21:11.563 --> 00:21:14.149 position:50% align:center
And we're eating cake in
Berlin once this is done!

00:21:14.232 --> 00:21:16.901 position:50% align:center
So don't tell us to
"take care of the rest." 

00:21:18.361 --> 00:21:21.531 position:50% align:center
I won't follow a stupid
order like that!

00:21:21.614 --> 00:21:22.907 position:50% align:center
Thanks, Trude.

00:21:22.991 --> 00:21:25.785 position:50% align:center
Yeah. You better
be sorry, Minna!

00:21:25.869 --> 00:21:29.664 position:50% align:center
Erica, I... I was being foolish.

00:21:29.748 --> 00:21:30.915 position:50% align:center
You two are right.

00:21:30.999 --> 00:21:33.877 position:50% align:center
Well, as long as you
learned your lesson.

00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:35.462 position:50% align:center
Okay, it's time to head home!

00:21:35.545 --> 00:21:36.921 position:50% align:center
I'm hungry!

00:21:41.051 --> 00:21:43.094 position:50% align:center

Excellent work!

00:21:43.178 --> 00:21:44.471 position:50% align:center
Uh-oh!

00:21:46.639 --> 00:21:48.475 position:50% align:center
Did you just spill the fuel?

00:21:49.601 --> 00:21:50.602 position:50% align:center

Ah! No!
