Ready to launch!

Don't give up! You've got this!

00:00:23.982 --> 00:00:25.734 position:50% align:center
I did it! I'm flying!

00:00:25.817 --> 00:00:27.944 position:50% align:center
All right, Miyafuji,
looking good!

00:00:28.028 --> 00:00:30.447 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIKA screaming]

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:34.451 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIKA]
Well, shoot.

00:00:34.534 --> 00:00:36.453 position:50% align:center
I guess I'm still
not tough enough.

00:00:36.536 --> 00:00:39.330 position:50% align:center
I'm not sure that toughness
is the issue here.

00:00:39.414 --> 00:00:41.875 position:50% align:center
I dunno. Sakamoto used to
solve all her problems

00:00:41.958 --> 00:00:45.086 position:50% align:center
by sweating them out, so maybe
that's the answer for me, too!

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:46.212 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna go for a run.

00:00:46.296 --> 00:00:48.298 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKA]
Uh-- Then I'll join you!

00:02:26.146 --> 00:02:27.522 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:02:29.274 --> 00:02:33.111 position:50% align:center
[sighs] Why won't my magical
pressure get fixed already?

00:02:33.194 --> 00:02:35.822 position:50% align:center
I'm not good for anything
while I'm like this.

00:02:38.283 --> 00:02:40.285 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIKA yelps]
It's so cold!

00:02:40.368 --> 00:02:42.078 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKA]
What's wrong, Miyafuji?

00:02:43.246 --> 00:02:45.415 position:50% align:center
[PERRINE]
Did that cool your jets a bit?

00:02:45.498 --> 00:02:46.958 position:50% align:center
Why would you do that, Perrine?

00:02:47.042 --> 00:02:48.543 position:50% align:center
You need to refocus.

00:02:48.626 --> 00:02:50.253 position:50% align:center
At this rate,
you'll overwork yourself

00:02:50.337 --> 00:02:52.630 position:50% align:center
long before your magic is fixed.

00:02:53.882 --> 00:02:57.385 position:50% align:center
[sighs] Dry off
and come with me.

00:02:57.469 --> 00:02:58.803 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIKA]
Huh?

00:03:02.766 --> 00:03:04.309 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIKA yelps]

00:03:04.392 --> 00:03:06.936 position:50% align:center
Is this training?
Where are we going?

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:08.480 position:50% align:center
Just to Nederland.

00:03:08.563 --> 00:03:11.358 position:50% align:center
The cyclamen and clematis are
supposed to be in bloom now.

00:03:11.441 --> 00:03:13.318 position:50% align:center
That's perfect--
I can make some medicine

00:03:13.401 --> 00:03:14.611 position:50% align:center
with ground clematis!

00:03:14.694 --> 00:03:17.238 position:50% align:center
Sorry, but,
Lieutenant Clostermann,

00:03:17.322 --> 00:03:20.200 position:50% align:center
surely we're not going there
just to look at some flowers.

00:03:20.283 --> 00:03:21.743 position:50% align:center
Not a fan of sight-seeing?

00:03:21.826 --> 00:03:23.578 position:50% align:center
Then you'll be pleased
to know that I was summoned

00:03:23.661 --> 00:03:25.622 position:50% align:center
by the Queen of
Nederland herself.

00:03:25.705 --> 00:03:27.499 position:50% align:center
Wait, did you say the queen?

00:03:27.582 --> 00:03:29.417 position:50% align:center
Huh?!

00:03:31.836 --> 00:03:33.129 position:50% align:center
[MINNA]
Prep for Operation Southwind

00:03:33.213 --> 00:03:34.631 position:50% align:center
is still running behind.

00:03:34.714 --> 00:03:36.174 position:50% align:center
That's worrisome.

00:03:36.257 --> 00:03:39.260 position:50% align:center
Supplies to the front lines
are taking too long to arrive.

00:03:39.344 --> 00:03:41.471 position:50% align:center
With that in mind,
I have a small request.

00:03:41.554 --> 00:03:43.098 position:50% align:center
A request for me?

00:03:43.181 --> 00:03:45.642 position:50% align:center
This operation requires
more aid from Europe

00:03:45.725 --> 00:03:49.354 position:50% align:center
than we've ever needed before.
Especially port cities.

00:03:49.437 --> 00:03:51.940 position:50% align:center
So I want you to speak to
the royal family of Nederland

00:03:52.023 --> 00:03:54.109 position:50% align:center
and try to strengthen our bond.

00:03:54.192 --> 00:03:56.486 position:50% align:center
I fear I don't know
where to start.

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:58.780 position:50% align:center
Luckily, the queen
has just requested

00:03:58.863 --> 00:04:00.365 position:50% align:center
a meeting with a Witch.

00:04:00.448 --> 00:04:01.866 position:50% align:center
That's surprising.

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:03.868 position:50% align:center
So will you accept the mission?

00:04:03.952 --> 00:04:05.286 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:07.080 position:50% align:center
I will, but if you don't mind,

00:04:07.163 --> 00:04:09.958 position:50% align:center
I'd like to bring
Miyafuji with me.

00:04:10.041 --> 00:04:12.252 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKA] I thought the
palace was in Den Haag.

00:04:12.335 --> 00:04:13.795 position:50% align:center
Yes, but some of
the royal family

00:04:13.878 --> 00:04:16.965 position:50% align:center
has come to the border
to help raise morale.

00:04:17.048 --> 00:04:21.052 position:50% align:center
And here we are.
That's the Kasteel de Haar.

00:04:24.014 --> 00:04:26.349 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIKA gasps]
Look at the flowers!

00:04:26.433 --> 00:04:27.434 position:50% align:center
They're beautiful!

00:04:27.517 --> 00:04:28.977 position:50% align:center
Do you think they'll
let me take some

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:31.521 position:50% align:center
to make medicine
and herb tea?

00:04:35.025 --> 00:04:36.484 position:50% align:center
[MAN 305A]
Those are some big birds.

00:04:36.568 --> 00:04:38.737 position:50% align:center
You goin' blind?
Those are Witches.

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:39.988 position:50% align:center
Looks like we might finally

00:04:40.071 --> 00:04:42.824 position:50% align:center
make those flowers bloom
after all, gentlemen.

00:04:42.907 --> 00:04:44.826 position:50% align:center
Hmph.

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:48.329 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIKA gasps] They've got
chandeliers and everything!

00:04:48.413 --> 00:04:50.915 position:50% align:center
It certainly is regal, isn't it?

00:04:53.043 --> 00:04:54.878 position:50% align:center
[PERRINE]
Blue tulips!

00:04:54.961 --> 00:04:56.755 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIKA]
What, is that a big deal?

00:04:56.838 --> 00:04:58.173 position:50% align:center
Until they bloomed here,

00:04:58.256 --> 00:05:00.842 position:50% align:center
blue tulips weren't even
thought to exist in the world.

00:05:00.925 --> 00:05:03.011 position:50% align:center
They've become a bit
of a legend, actually.

00:05:03.094 --> 00:05:05.263 position:50% align:center
[door clicks]

00:05:05.347 --> 00:05:08.850 position:50% align:center
[QUEEN chuckles] That's the
symbol of our country.

00:05:08.933 --> 00:05:11.311 position:50% align:center
The Queen of Nederland,
they're called.

00:05:11.394 --> 00:05:12.645 position:50% align:center
Greetings, Your Highness!

00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:13.938 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
Huh?!

00:05:14.022 --> 00:05:17.317 position:50% align:center
I'm pleased that you
were able to make it.

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:20.403 position:50% align:center
The Queen of Nederland
was our nation's pride and joy.

00:05:20.487 --> 00:05:23.782 position:50% align:center
A treasure beloved
by all our citizens.

00:05:23.865 --> 00:05:26.284 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKA] And this is the
only nation where they grow?

00:05:26.368 --> 00:05:27.660 position:50% align:center
Indeed.

00:05:27.744 --> 00:05:30.330 position:50% align:center
They first bloomed 20 years
ago in this very place.

00:05:30.413 --> 00:05:32.874 position:50% align:center
And then, they grew
in number, bit by bit.

00:05:32.957 --> 00:05:36.211 position:50% align:center
That is, until the Neuroi
destroyed our greenhouses.

00:05:36.294 --> 00:05:38.588 position:50% align:center
We managed to rescue
a small number of bulbs,

00:05:38.672 --> 00:05:41.508 position:50% align:center
but they haven't bloomed
in many years now.

00:05:41.591 --> 00:05:42.592 position:50% align:center
We've fought long and hard

00:05:42.676 --> 00:05:44.803 position:50% align:center
to regain our homes
from the enemy.

00:05:44.886 --> 00:05:48.515 position:50% align:center
And yet, we still have not
won back our spirit.

00:05:48.598 --> 00:05:50.517 position:50% align:center
To bring our people hope again,

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:53.978 position:50% align:center
we need the Queen of Nederland
to bloom once more.

00:05:54.062 --> 00:05:55.522 position:50% align:center
We got this! Right, Perrine?

00:05:55.605 --> 00:05:56.898 position:50% align:center
Let's not be hasty.

00:05:56.981 --> 00:05:59.401 position:50% align:center
But why do you need
Witches for this?

00:05:59.484 --> 00:06:01.611 position:50% align:center
The very first time
that the tulips bloomed,

00:06:01.695 --> 00:06:04.114 position:50% align:center
it was a Witch who
assisted the gardeners.

00:06:04.197 --> 00:06:06.616 position:50% align:center
I implore you to
lend us your strength.

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:09.744 position:50% align:center
Your Majesty, please don't
bow your head to us!

00:06:09.828 --> 00:06:13.289 position:50% align:center
We'll do everything
in our power to help!

00:06:13.373 --> 00:06:15.500 position:50% align:center
[MAN 305A] Oh, we've been
waitin' for you ladies!

00:06:15.583 --> 00:06:18.003 position:50% align:center
The queen told us everything.
We're ready to do this!

00:06:18.086 --> 00:06:19.504 position:50% align:center
Go ahead!

00:06:19.587 --> 00:06:21.673 position:50% align:center
Cast your magic on the tulip
and make it bloom all nice!

00:06:21.756 --> 00:06:23.800 position:50% align:center
I don't have any magic
that would help.

00:06:23.883 --> 00:06:26.428 position:50% align:center
Do you think some of my
healing magic might work?

00:06:26.511 --> 00:06:27.762 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKA]
I'm not sure if that's wise,

00:06:27.846 --> 00:06:30.640 position:50% align:center
since your magical pressure
is still unstable.

00:06:30.724 --> 00:06:32.600 position:50% align:center
Are you gonna make
this flower bloom or not?

00:06:32.684 --> 00:06:34.019 position:50% align:center
[ALL gasp]

00:06:34.102 --> 00:06:38.231 position:50% align:center
All right. It's worth a shot.
I'll do the best I can.

00:06:38.314 --> 00:06:40.233 position:50% align:center
[MAN 305C] You really
kept us in suspense there!

00:06:40.316 --> 00:06:42.235 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIKA]
We're counting on you, Perrine!

00:06:48.158 --> 00:06:50.577 position:50% align:center
[PERRINE]
Please... bloom.

00:06:59.669 --> 00:07:00.754 position:50% align:center
Uh?

Ah! I broke it!

00:07:07.469 --> 00:07:08.762 position:50% align:center
What just happened?

00:07:08.845 --> 00:07:10.221 position:50% align:center
I told you, didn't I?

00:07:10.305 --> 00:07:12.390 position:50% align:center
Can't count on Witches
to do our job.

00:07:12.474 --> 00:07:14.642 position:50% align:center
Maybe it wasn't magic
that made them bloom.

00:07:14.726 --> 00:07:16.436 position:50% align:center
I really got my hopes up, too.

00:07:16.519 --> 00:07:18.605 position:50% align:center
Sorry, girls, but you
can't do everything

00:07:18.688 --> 00:07:22.442 position:50% align:center
just 'cause you're Witches.
Get out of our way.

00:07:22.525 --> 00:07:24.152 position:50% align:center
As you said, we're
Witches, meaning that

00:07:24.235 --> 00:07:27.197 position:50% align:center
we are engaged in the extremely
important mission of reclaiming

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:28.365 position:50% align:center
Berlin from the Neuroi,

00:07:28.448 --> 00:07:30.116 position:50% align:center
which flowers have
very little to do with!

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:31.868 position:50% align:center
--[MAN 305D] Then why--
--[PERRINE] However!

00:07:31.951 --> 00:07:34.079 position:50% align:center
The queen requested
our assistance.

00:07:34.162 --> 00:07:35.955 position:50% align:center
And Witches keep their word.

00:07:36.039 --> 00:07:39.167 position:50% align:center
Therefore, we will make
those flowers bloom.

00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:42.420 position:50% align:center
Hah! If you don't have
experience, then you're useless!

00:07:42.504 --> 00:07:45.256 position:50% align:center
Witch or not, an amateur
is only gonna get in the way.

00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:46.966 position:50% align:center
So shoo! Scram!

00:07:47.050 --> 00:07:48.885 position:50% align:center
If your expertise
was worth anything,

00:07:48.968 --> 00:07:50.679 position:50% align:center
you would have made
it bloom already.

00:07:50.762 --> 00:07:51.805 position:50% align:center
What do you mean?

00:07:51.888 --> 00:07:53.139 position:50% align:center
I don't know. What do <i>you</i> mean?

"what do you mean?"

[PERRINE]
Why don't you tell me?!

00:07:56.935 --> 00:07:59.312 position:50% align:center
Well, I projected
a lot of confidence,

00:07:59.396 --> 00:08:01.773 position:50% align:center
but I haven't a single
clue where to start.

00:08:01.856 --> 00:08:04.651 position:50% align:center
What did the last Witch do
to make the flowers bloom?

00:08:04.734 --> 00:08:06.695 position:50% align:center
Good point. If we wanna
solve this mystery,

00:08:06.778 --> 00:08:08.655 position:50% align:center
--then we should start there.

putting her back into it, huh?

00:08:42.439 --> 00:08:46.276 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIKA giggles] I used to
farm yams with my family!

Hmph.

[PERRINE yawns]

00:08:50.447 --> 00:08:53.491 position:50% align:center
[PERRINE] So this is where that
little imp scurried off to.

00:08:53.575 --> 00:08:55.368 position:50% align:center
It's pretty
in-character for her.

00:08:55.452 --> 00:08:57.746 position:50% align:center
I might as well
lend a hand, too!

00:08:57.829 --> 00:09:00.123 position:50% align:center

Let me help!

00:09:01.875 --> 00:09:04.461 position:50% align:center
Hey! Get to work
already, would ya?

00:09:04.544 --> 00:09:06.254 position:50% align:center
If you can't even prep
a field, little missy,

00:09:06.338 --> 00:09:09.507 position:50% align:center
there's no way you can
make a queen bloom!

00:09:09.591 --> 00:09:11.593 position:50% align:center
Oh, is that how it is?

[PERRINE grunting]

00:09:13.470 --> 00:09:15.889 position:50% align:center
[MAN 305D] That's a weak swing
if I've ever seen one.

00:09:15.972 --> 00:09:17.432 position:50% align:center
The Witch who helped us
before was able

00:09:17.515 --> 00:09:20.101 position:50% align:center
to do the job properly at least.

00:09:20.185 --> 00:09:21.353 position:50% align:center
[PERRINE]
Give me an hour of practice,

00:09:21.436 --> 00:09:23.646 position:50% align:center
and I'll surpass that

[MAN 305D]
Hah! You talk a big game,

00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:27.275 position:50% align:center
but we'll see how you stack up.

00:09:27.359 --> 00:09:29.069 position:50% align:center
[PERRINE] Why are you
plowing this by hand?

00:09:29.152 --> 00:09:31.237 position:50% align:center
Don't you have any
heavy machinery?

00:09:31.321 --> 00:09:33.865 position:50% align:center
Machinery? We've got
something like that.

00:09:33.948 --> 00:09:36.368 position:50% align:center
Uh?

00:09:36.451 --> 00:09:37.869 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKA]
My goodness.

00:09:37.952 --> 00:09:40.538 position:50% align:center

as "heavy machinery," but...

It used to belong to the army.

00:09:42.290 --> 00:09:45.377 position:50% align:center
These days, nobody can
make it move, though.

00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:47.796 position:50% align:center
Why is everything always broken?

Oh!

00:09:52.884 --> 00:09:54.344 position:50% align:center
[MAN 305B]
Now that's handy!

00:09:54.427 --> 00:09:56.137 position:50% align:center
Why do I have to do this?

00:09:56.221 --> 00:09:59.015 position:50% align:center
Okay! It's looking good!
Now we just gotta keep at it!

00:09:59.099 --> 00:10:03.311 position:50% align:center
Uh... We don't have time
for agriculture, do we?

00:10:06.815 --> 00:10:09.734 position:50% align:center
[MAN 305A] Wow, we really got
a lot of work done today!

00:10:09.818 --> 00:10:11.945 position:50% align:center
And we have you ladies
to thank for that!

You youngsters have
so much energy!

00:10:13.905 --> 00:10:17.409 position:50% align:center
[clears throat] Well... I think
that's enough for right now.

00:10:17.492 --> 00:10:18.868 position:50% align:center
It's time for dinner.

00:10:18.952 --> 00:10:20.620 position:50% align:center

Sounds good!

00:10:22.247 --> 00:10:24.666 position:50% align:center

[MAN 305B]
Fuso's miso soup, huh?

00:10:26.710 --> 00:10:28.586 position:50% align:center
Really warms the
bones, doesn't it?

00:10:28.670 --> 00:10:30.964 position:50% align:center
A pity I'm not
50 years younger!

00:10:31.047 --> 00:10:33.341 position:50% align:center
I'd ask you to marry me!

00:10:33.425 --> 00:10:36.594 position:50% align:center
Huh. It's all right, I s'pose.

00:10:37.887 --> 00:10:39.806 position:50% align:center
Back to it.

Where are you going?

00:10:41.808 --> 00:10:43.560 position:50% align:center
To the greenhouse.

00:10:44.811 --> 00:10:46.604 position:50% align:center
[MAN 305D] As you can tell,
it's gotten cold,

00:10:46.688 --> 00:10:48.857 position:50% align:center
so we need to light the boiler.

00:10:48.940 --> 00:10:50.275 position:50% align:center
At this time of year,

00:10:50.358 --> 00:10:51.901 position:50% align:center
it's hard to keep the
temperature right for the queens

00:10:51.985 --> 00:10:53.445 position:50% align:center
once night falls.

00:10:53.528 --> 00:10:55.989 position:50% align:center
If you don't keep it around
20 degrees, they'll all wilt.

That's pretty precise!

If everything works out,

00:10:59.868 --> 00:11:02.120 position:50% align:center
they should bloom
at dawn in two days.

00:11:02.203 --> 00:11:04.998 position:50% align:center
Maybe this'll be the year
it finally works again.

We take turns sleeping,

Back when I was young,

there was a Nederland Witch
who used this very unit.

But it's obsolete now, so I'll
make it our back-up boiler.

we could use your power here.

I dunno.

But it looked like it had some

we just needed a Witch

What's that?

Why, it's a special
type of lightning magic

unique to the
Clostermann family.

Did you say "Clostermann"?

Actually, wasn't that
the name of the first Witch

who made these bloom?

Penelope Clostermann, I believe.

sweet of them.

But fancy herbs or not,
the important thing

00:21:43.970 --> 00:21:46.639 position:50% align:center
is that you're finally able
to fly properly again.

that the secret

to stabilizing your
