[grunts]

00:01:52.529 --> 00:01:54.114 position:50% align:center
Where am I?

00:01:54.197 --> 00:01:56.282 position:50% align:center
Why am I in this bed?

00:01:56.366 --> 00:01:57.784 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah, that's
right! Shizuka!

00:01:57.867 --> 00:01:59.077 position:50% align:center
[MINNA]
Hattori's fine.

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:01.287 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Commander Mina.

00:02:01.371 --> 00:02:03.957 position:50% align:center
She's in the barracks now
recovering from exhaustion,

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:06.084 position:50% align:center
but she escaped in one piece.

00:02:06.167 --> 00:02:07.669 position:50% align:center
And she has you
to thank for that.

00:02:07.752 --> 00:02:09.713 position:50% align:center
I'm so relieved.

00:02:09.796 --> 00:02:12.882 position:50% align:center
[DOCTOR 311A] Hm. You seem to be
on the up and up yourself.

00:02:12.966 --> 00:02:14.134 position:50% align:center
Try using some magic.

00:02:14.217 --> 00:02:15.427 position:50% align:center
Okay!

00:02:20.765 --> 00:02:21.891 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIKA]
Huh?

00:02:21.975 --> 00:02:23.727 position:50% align:center
As I suspected,
you depleted all your magic

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:25.311 position:50% align:center
during yesterday's operation.

00:02:25.395 --> 00:02:28.732 position:50% align:center
Well, you'll be unable to fly
for about a week or so.

00:02:28.815 --> 00:02:31.317 position:50% align:center
You're unfit for
combat until then, too.

00:02:31.401 --> 00:02:34.112 position:50% align:center
[sighs] Right, I see. But, hey,

00:02:34.195 --> 00:02:37.615 position:50% align:center
if Shizuka's all right, at
least there's a silver lining.

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:41.494 position:50% align:center
Miyafuji. Can we step
outside and talk a moment?

00:02:41.578 --> 00:02:42.829 position:50% align:center
Okay.

00:02:43.955 --> 00:02:46.166 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIKA]
Army High Command?

00:02:46.249 --> 00:02:48.376 position:50% align:center
[MINNA]
Yes. In Amsterdam.

00:02:49.669 --> 00:02:52.589 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIKA]
Whoa. Look at all these tanks.

00:02:52.672 --> 00:02:54.632 position:50% align:center
[MINNA] The Neuroi nest
has formed a massive wall

00:02:54.716 --> 00:02:56.092 position:50% align:center
around Berlin now.

00:02:56.176 --> 00:02:58.803 position:50% align:center
Our surface force is
intended to combat that.

00:02:58.887 --> 00:03:00.555 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIKA]
Sakamoto!

00:03:00.638 --> 00:03:01.723 position:50% align:center
Hey!

00:03:01.806 --> 00:03:03.266 position:50% align:center
Are you going to be
joining us, as well?

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:05.935 position:50% align:center
I need to remain here
at the base, unfortunately.

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:07.854 position:50% align:center
Minna, it's on you now.

00:03:07.937 --> 00:03:08.730 position:50% align:center
Understood.

00:03:08.813 --> 00:03:09.814 position:50% align:center
[knocking]

00:03:09.898 --> 00:03:11.566 position:50% align:center
Let's wrap it up
or we're gonna be late

00:03:11.649 --> 00:03:13.234 position:50% align:center
for the conference!

00:03:16.529 --> 00:03:18.448 position:50% align:center
Right, why don't you
break it down for me?

00:03:18.531 --> 00:03:20.492 position:50% align:center
We'll need ten days
until Sergeant Miyafuji

00:03:20.575 --> 00:03:21.868 position:50% align:center
is able to fly again.

00:03:21.951 --> 00:03:23.036 position:50% align:center
[PATTON]
What?

00:03:23.119 --> 00:03:25.455 position:50% align:center
The orders were to
conserve her strength!

00:03:25.538 --> 00:03:26.539 position:50% align:center
We did the best we could

00:03:26.623 --> 00:03:28.792 position:50% align:center
considering the
situation in Kiel.

00:03:28.875 --> 00:03:30.418 position:50% align:center
The port was almost destroyed.

00:03:30.502 --> 00:03:32.504 position:50% align:center
Rather short sighted,
considering we still have

00:03:32.587 --> 00:03:35.131 position:50% align:center
a war to win and her
magic is all tapped out!

00:03:35.215 --> 00:03:36.966 position:50% align:center
We'd like to request
a ten-day extension

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:38.385 position:50% align:center
for the operation.

00:03:38.468 --> 00:03:40.553 position:50% align:center
If that's granted,
we can ensure the sergeant

00:03:40.637 --> 00:03:43.139 position:50% align:center
enters the battlefield
in optimal condition.

00:03:43.223 --> 00:03:45.016 position:50% align:center
Ten days, is it?

00:03:48.978 --> 00:03:50.689 position:50% align:center
While I'd love to,
you have to keep in mind

00:03:50.772 --> 00:03:52.482 position:50% align:center
that we're not the only
ones callin' the shots

00:03:52.565 --> 00:03:54.609 position:50% align:center
when it comes to
taking back Berlin.

00:03:54.693 --> 00:03:55.860 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:02.242 position:50% align:center
[knocking]

00:04:02.325 --> 00:04:04.285 position:50% align:center
Major! We're ready to go.

00:04:04.369 --> 00:04:06.121 position:50% align:center
Very well, Ensign.

00:04:08.206 --> 00:04:10.166 position:50% align:center
Miyafuji...

00:04:11.418 --> 00:04:12.585 position:50% align:center
[GENERAL 311A]
You want us to what?

00:04:12.669 --> 00:04:14.004 position:50% align:center
Postpone the mission?

00:04:14.087 --> 00:04:16.381 position:50% align:center
[PATTON] Yes. Sergeant
Miyafuji will require

00:04:16.464 --> 00:04:19.509 position:50% align:center
sufficient rest in order to
recover her strength for battle.

00:04:19.592 --> 00:04:21.219 position:50% align:center
--It's the surest--
--[GENERAL 311A] Are you crazy?

00:04:21.302 --> 00:04:23.680 position:50% align:center
We're burning through piles of
money and resources every day

00:04:23.763 --> 00:04:26.057 position:50% align:center
to keep this operation
up and running!

00:04:26.141 --> 00:04:28.309 position:50% align:center
It's already been
massively delayed.

00:04:28.393 --> 00:04:30.103 position:50% align:center
We can't afford to wait anymore!

00:04:30.186 --> 00:04:33.314 position:50% align:center
My forces will just take
back Berlin on our own!

00:04:33.398 --> 00:04:34.524 position:50% align:center
Said so confidently,

00:04:34.607 --> 00:04:36.735 position:50% align:center
but I've yet to see
you back up that ego.

00:04:36.818 --> 00:04:39.654 position:50% align:center
Let my infantry show you
how to finish the job!

00:04:39.738 --> 00:04:42.407 position:50% align:center
Huh. You would be a fool
to send in his riffraff.

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:44.242 position:50% align:center
Leave this mission
to the elite forces

00:04:44.325 --> 00:04:45.535 position:50% align:center
if you want it done right.

00:04:45.618 --> 00:04:47.662 position:50% align:center
No! Let my unit handle it!

00:04:47.746 --> 00:04:48.830 position:50% align:center
[BOTH grunt]

00:04:48.913 --> 00:04:50.081 position:50% align:center
We'll use my men!

00:04:50.165 --> 00:04:52.292 position:50% align:center
Just sit down. You know
you're out of funding.

00:04:52.375 --> 00:04:53.710 position:50% align:center
[GENERAL 311E]
You watch your mouth!

00:04:53.793 --> 00:04:55.128 position:50% align:center
[GENERAL 311A] You can't even
supply your own troops!

00:04:55.211 --> 00:04:56.796 position:50% align:center
[GENERAL 311C] Better than
your army of random people

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:58.214 position:50% align:center
--from the street!
--[GENERAL 311A] Bastard!

00:04:58.298 --> 00:04:59.716 position:50% align:center
[BRADLEY]
As planned, the operation

00:04:59.799 --> 00:05:03.261 position:50% align:center
will launch at ten tomorrow.
There will be no delays.

00:05:03.345 --> 00:05:04.637 position:50% align:center
[PATTON]
Sorry, missy.

00:05:04.721 --> 00:05:08.600 position:50% align:center
Even we're just cogs in
the machine, unfortunately.

00:05:08.683 --> 00:05:10.268 position:50% align:center
Will I be allowed to go, too?

00:05:10.352 --> 00:05:12.020 position:50% align:center
It would be irresponsible
to send you out

00:05:12.103 --> 00:05:13.897 position:50% align:center
without your magic power.

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:16.775 position:50% align:center
So I can't participate
after all then.

00:05:19.652 --> 00:05:22.572 position:50% align:center
[HIKARI]
Huh. I think I know her.

00:05:22.655 --> 00:05:24.824 position:50% align:center
Is something wrong, Hikari?

00:05:24.908 --> 00:05:27.327 position:50% align:center
I'm positive that I've
seen that girl somewhere.

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:30.080 position:50% align:center
Minna? Or that Fuso Witch
she's walking with?

00:05:30.163 --> 00:05:32.332 position:50% align:center
Ugh, why does she
look so familiar?

00:05:32.415 --> 00:05:34.584 position:50% align:center
Aren't they from the 501st?

00:05:34.668 --> 00:05:36.169 position:50% align:center
I wonder what
kind of a game plan

00:05:36.252 --> 00:05:38.797 position:50% align:center
they've got cooked up to deal
with those wall-type Neuroi.

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:40.423 position:50% align:center
Things are looking
dire in Berlin.

00:05:40.507 --> 00:05:43.093 position:50% align:center
We can't let our guard down
for a moment either, girls.

00:05:43.176 --> 00:05:46.221 position:50% align:center
Of course. Let's go, Hikari.

00:05:46.304 --> 00:05:47.472 position:50% align:center
Right.

00:05:51.434 --> 00:05:53.353 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:05:57.357 --> 00:05:59.150 position:50% align:center
Oh, I almost forgot.

00:06:01.361 --> 00:06:04.114 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKA] I was injured
in yesterday's battle.

00:06:04.197 --> 00:06:07.492 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Miyafuji!

00:06:07.575 --> 00:06:09.953 position:50% align:center
Miyafuji!

00:06:10.036 --> 00:06:11.496 position:50% align:center
Major Sakamoto.

00:06:15.792 --> 00:06:16.960 position:50% align:center
Where am I?

00:06:17.043 --> 00:06:19.921 position:50% align:center
[URSULA] So that's the
situation with Miyafuji.

00:06:20.005 --> 00:06:21.506 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKA]
She's here?

00:06:23.133 --> 00:06:24.300 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:06:24.384 --> 00:06:26.136 position:50% align:center
Uh, Hattori?

00:06:26.219 --> 00:06:28.263 position:50% align:center
Why are you out of bed?

00:06:28.346 --> 00:06:30.598 position:50% align:center
Hello, Major.

00:06:30.682 --> 00:06:33.309 position:50% align:center
What are you doing with that?

00:06:33.393 --> 00:06:34.978 position:50% align:center
That's the Shinden!

00:06:35.061 --> 00:06:37.605 position:50% align:center
The unit Miyafuji
was using before.

00:06:37.689 --> 00:06:39.607 position:50% align:center
Isn't she out of magic, though?

00:06:39.691 --> 00:06:41.484 position:50% align:center
I thought that she spent
everything she had

00:06:41.568 --> 00:06:44.404 position:50% align:center
because of my failure last time.

00:06:44.487 --> 00:06:45.780 position:50% align:center
Hang on a second!

00:06:45.864 --> 00:06:48.366 position:50% align:center
Are you planning on using her
in the next operation?

00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:51.911 position:50% align:center
Actually, High Command had
requested her specifically.

00:06:51.995 --> 00:06:54.164 position:50% align:center
The plan was to have her use
the Shinden as a sort of

00:06:54.247 --> 00:06:57.208 position:50% align:center
ultimate weapon in our
final assault on Berlin.

00:06:57.292 --> 00:06:58.668 position:50% align:center
Exactly. Which is why

00:06:58.752 --> 00:07:00.503 position:50% align:center
I've been working around
the clock to fix it up

00:07:00.587 --> 00:07:02.547 position:50% align:center
ever since Sakamoto asked.

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:03.882 position:50% align:center
Then does that mean...?

00:07:03.965 --> 00:07:06.885 position:50% align:center
Dr. Miyafuji is really
incredible, y'know?

00:07:06.968 --> 00:07:09.471 position:50% align:center
The transfer efficiency
for magic power on this unit

00:07:09.554 --> 00:07:11.431 position:50% align:center
is in a class of its own.

00:07:11.514 --> 00:07:13.141 position:50% align:center
But with Miyafuji's
power tapped out,

00:07:13.224 --> 00:07:16.353 position:50% align:center
we have a conundrum here,
and little time to solve it.

00:07:16.436 --> 00:07:17.812 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKA]
Hold on, Major!

00:07:17.896 --> 00:07:19.230 position:50% align:center
Please reconsider!

00:07:19.314 --> 00:07:21.149 position:50% align:center
It would be much better to
wait until her magic power

00:07:21.232 --> 00:07:22.317 position:50% align:center
is fully recovered!

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:23.818 position:50% align:center
[SAKAMOTO]
Hattori.

00:07:23.902 --> 00:07:25.403 position:50% align:center
You know just as well as I do

00:07:25.487 --> 00:07:27.697 position:50% align:center
that I don't have the clearance
to change our current strategy.

00:07:27.781 --> 00:07:29.157 position:50% align:center
But, Major!

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:30.700 position:50% align:center
Surely this can't sit right
with you knowing how hard

00:07:30.784 --> 00:07:33.411 position:50% align:center
she's been working to
control her magic pressure!

00:07:33.495 --> 00:07:36.122 position:50% align:center
It's not fair if
Miyafuji can't fight!

00:07:36.206 --> 00:07:37.374 position:50% align:center
Fate is rarely fair.

00:07:37.457 --> 00:07:38.208 position:50% align:center
But, Major!

00:07:38.291 --> 00:07:39.876 position:50% align:center
That's enough!

00:07:39.959 --> 00:07:41.127 position:50% align:center
This is top secret!

00:07:41.211 --> 00:07:43.046 position:50% align:center
You'll tell nobody of
what you saw here today.

00:07:43.129 --> 00:07:45.006 position:50% align:center
That is an order.

00:07:45.090 --> 00:07:46.716 position:50% align:center
And that includes Miyafuji.

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:51.304 position:50% align:center
Tell her, and the punishment
will be severe. Understand?

00:07:51.388 --> 00:07:52.722 position:50% align:center
I do.

00:07:52.806 --> 00:07:54.557 position:50% align:center
[SAKAMOTO] Now, let's lock
it up here in the hanger.

00:07:54.641 --> 00:07:56.851 position:50% align:center
We need to ship it
to the rear tomorrow.

00:07:56.935 --> 00:07:58.103 position:50% align:center
Everyone, dismissed.

00:07:58.186 --> 00:07:59.187 position:50% align:center
Yes, ma'am.

00:07:59.270 --> 00:08:01.940 position:50% align:center
Hattori?

00:08:02.023 --> 00:08:04.067 position:50% align:center
Yes, I understand, Major.

00:08:10.657 --> 00:08:12.617 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIKA]
Shizuka!

00:08:12.701 --> 00:08:16.496 position:50% align:center
You're okay! I'm so glad!
Does it hurt anywhere?

00:08:16.579 --> 00:08:17.664 position:50% align:center
Not at all!

00:08:17.747 --> 00:08:19.708 position:50% align:center
Do ya see this here?
I'm as good as new.

00:08:19.791 --> 00:08:21.876 position:50% align:center
How 'bout you?
Are you doing okay?

00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:23.753 position:50% align:center
Oh, do you mean my magic power?

00:08:23.837 --> 00:08:27.716 position:50% align:center
I'm fine. Don't worry.
It'll be back soon.

00:08:27.799 --> 00:08:29.384 position:50% align:center
[SAKAMOTO]
When will the operation begin?

00:08:29.467 --> 00:08:32.012 position:50% align:center
Bright and early tomorrow,
just as we discussed.

00:08:32.095 --> 00:08:33.763 position:50% align:center
--[gasps]
--[SAKAMOTO] Very well then.

00:08:33.847 --> 00:08:35.348 position:50% align:center
Hey, if Ursula's
here at the base,

00:08:35.432 --> 00:08:37.267 position:50% align:center
does that mean we're getting
a new weapon or something?

00:08:37.350 --> 00:08:38.643 position:50% align:center
'Cause that would
be perfect timing.

00:08:38.727 --> 00:08:39.853 position:50% align:center
I--

00:08:39.936 --> 00:08:42.063 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Unfortunately, it won't

00:08:42.147 --> 00:08:44.107 position:50% align:center
be of any use for
this operation, though.

00:08:44.190 --> 00:08:45.984 position:50% align:center
Isn't that right,
Officer Ursula?

00:08:46.067 --> 00:08:48.069 position:50% align:center
[URSULA]
Yes. Regrettably so.

00:08:48.153 --> 00:08:52.323 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIKA sighs] What a shame!
I was kind of hoping to see it.

00:08:52.407 --> 00:08:57.787 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKA whimpering]

00:08:57.871 --> 00:09:01.249 position:50% align:center
This is... This is all my fault!

00:09:01.332 --> 00:09:03.001 position:50% align:center
What's wrong, Shizuka?

00:09:03.084 --> 00:09:05.337 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKA]
I'm sorry, Miyafuji!

00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:08.923 position:50% align:center
I'm so sorry!

00:09:09.007 --> 00:09:11.301 position:50% align:center
Will you please
tell me what's wrong?

00:09:11.384 --> 00:09:12.802 position:50% align:center
Hattori.

00:09:12.886 --> 00:09:15.055 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKA whimpering]

00:09:15.138 --> 00:09:23.813 position:50% align:center
[sobbing]

00:09:30.070 --> 00:09:32.280 position:50% align:center
[MINNA] The Neuroi nest,
Wolf, has changed its form

00:09:32.364 --> 00:09:36.159 position:50% align:center
and is now surrounding Berlin
as a series of walls.

00:09:36.242 --> 00:09:37.827 position:50% align:center
This mission,
Operation Victoria,

00:09:37.911 --> 00:09:40.497 position:50% align:center
will involve our full forces,
plus the Western Theater.

00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:43.124 position:50% align:center
Our plan is to destroy
the dome-type main unit

00:09:43.208 --> 00:09:44.542 position:50% align:center
at the epicenter.

00:09:44.626 --> 00:09:47.128 position:50% align:center
This time, we're taking
Berlin back, once and for all.

00:09:47.212 --> 00:09:48.463 position:50% align:center
Sounds swell and all,

00:09:48.546 --> 00:09:50.840 position:50% align:center
but how do we get close
with those big old walls?

00:09:50.924 --> 00:09:52.092 position:50% align:center
If we do an airstrike,

00:09:52.175 --> 00:09:54.969 position:50% align:center
we can expect to be met
with a shower of beams.

00:09:55.053 --> 00:09:56.346 position:50% align:center
Not to worry.

00:09:56.429 --> 00:09:57.806 position:50% align:center
We have General Patton
and his tank corps to handle

00:09:57.889 --> 00:10:00.266 position:50% align:center
that part of the
operation for us.

00:10:00.350 --> 00:10:03.103 position:50% align:center
Also, meet our ultimate weapon.

00:10:03.186 --> 00:10:04.979 position:50% align:center
The Landkreuzer Ratte.

00:10:05.063 --> 00:10:06.106 position:50% align:center
Now, that's big!

00:10:06.189 --> 00:10:07.982 position:50% align:center
Made in Karlsland, I'm sure.

00:10:08.066 --> 00:10:10.360 position:50% align:center
That thing is
utterly ridiculous.

00:10:10.443 --> 00:10:12.278 position:50% align:center
This time, we will
have two objectives.

00:10:12.362 --> 00:10:14.489 position:50% align:center
To stop attacks from
the wall-type Neuroi

00:10:14.572 --> 00:10:16.783 position:50% align:center
and to defend the
Ratte at all costs.

00:10:16.866 --> 00:10:19.619 position:50% align:center
It needs to get close enough
to be in firing range.

00:10:19.703 --> 00:10:20.995 position:50% align:center
So, we just guard them, then?

00:10:21.079 --> 00:10:22.163 position:50% align:center
It's a valid strategy

00:10:22.247 --> 00:10:24.332 position:50% align:center
focusing on taking
out the ground Neuroi.

00:10:24.416 --> 00:10:26.626 position:50% align:center
Do note, Sergeant Miyafuji
will be staying behind

00:10:26.710 --> 00:10:29.963 position:50% align:center
in Kiel due to her
lack of magic power.

00:10:30.046 --> 00:10:31.923 position:50% align:center
Miyafuji.

00:10:32.007 --> 00:10:34.384 position:50% align:center
Now, let's get ready to launch!

00:10:38.805 --> 00:10:41.224 position:50% align:center
[LYNNE] Hattori. Were you
able to get some sleep?

00:10:41.307 --> 00:10:43.643 position:50% align:center
Uh-huh! I'm in
tip-top shape now!

00:10:43.727 --> 00:10:45.103 position:50% align:center
We're happy to hear that.

00:10:45.186 --> 00:10:47.313 position:50% align:center
Try not to worry about
Miyafuji too much, okay?

00:10:47.397 --> 00:10:50.817 position:50% align:center
That's right! I agree!
So let's work extra hard!

00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:52.027 position:50% align:center
Prepare for launch!

00:10:52.110 --> 00:10:53.153 position:50% align:center
Right!

00:10:55.071 --> 00:10:56.614 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKA]
Miyafuji, don't you worry!

00:10:56.698 --> 00:10:58.783 position:50% align:center
I'll do my best out here!

00:10:58.867 --> 00:11:00.827 position:50% align:center
Wait for me in Kiel.

00:11:02.662 --> 00:11:04.748 position:50% align:center
It's finally time.

00:11:04.831 --> 00:11:06.458 position:50% align:center
Yeah. I can't wait to see

00:11:06.541 --> 00:11:09.794 position:50% align:center
what the Landkreuzer Ratte
here is capable of.

00:11:09.878 --> 00:11:12.505 position:50% align:center
We're rather lucky, you know?
Without Kiel's port,

00:11:12.589 --> 00:11:14.966 position:50% align:center
this wouldn't have been
possible at all.

00:11:15.050 --> 00:11:17.469 position:50% align:center
[PATTON] If those wall-type
Neuroi dare to stand in our way,

00:11:17.552 --> 00:11:19.512 position:50% align:center
we'll just blast 'em
with this fellah.

00:11:19.596 --> 00:11:20.680 position:50% align:center
'Scuse me!

00:11:20.764 --> 00:11:23.266 position:50% align:center
Sergeant Miyafuji!
Is something the matter?

00:11:23.350 --> 00:11:25.226 position:50% align:center
Can I make a request?

00:11:28.229 --> 00:11:29.314 position:50% align:center
Do you have any idea

00:11:29.397 --> 00:11:31.024 position:50% align:center
why Miyafuji didn't come
back to the base?

00:11:31.107 --> 00:11:34.402 position:50% align:center
Yeah. I believe she volunteered
to stay behind in Kiel.

00:11:34.486 --> 00:11:37.155 position:50% align:center
I guess she can't fight
without her magic power, huh?

00:11:37.238 --> 00:11:38.907 position:50% align:center
Perhaps she wanted
to keep Hattori

00:11:38.990 --> 00:11:40.450 position:50% align:center
from worrying too much.

00:11:40.533 --> 00:11:41.951 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKA gasps]

00:11:42.035 --> 00:11:44.287 position:50% align:center
[EILA]
Up ahead.

00:11:44.371 --> 00:11:47.165 position:50% align:center
That would be the border patrol
from Gallia and Karlsland.

00:11:47.248 --> 00:11:48.583 position:50% align:center
They're right on schedule.

00:11:48.667 --> 00:11:51.252 position:50% align:center
The 506th JFW.

00:11:51.336 --> 00:11:53.046 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIER 311H]
Okay, ready to lift it up!

00:11:53.129 --> 00:11:54.547 position:50% align:center
Careful, now!

00:11:56.174 --> 00:11:58.009 position:50% align:center
We're using a bomber
for transportation

00:11:58.093 --> 00:11:59.552 position:50% align:center
instead of for combat?

00:11:59.636 --> 00:12:00.970 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIER 311H] We weren't able
to launch it with the others

00:12:01.054 --> 00:12:03.264 position:50% align:center
last time because of a problem
we found with the tires,

00:12:03.348 --> 00:12:05.725 position:50% align:center
but Officer Ursula has
since cleared it for use.

00:12:05.809 --> 00:12:07.394 position:50% align:center
So, a B-17, huh?

00:12:07.477 --> 00:12:11.106 position:50% align:center
[URSULA] Hope you don't mind,
but I brought some extra cargo.

00:12:11.189 --> 00:12:12.691 position:50% align:center
I can see that.

00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:27.080 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIER 311B] General,
the MLRS rocket launchers

00:12:27.163 --> 00:12:28.540 position:50% align:center
are in position!

00:12:28.623 --> 00:12:30.709 position:50% align:center
Attack preparations
are complete!

00:12:30.792 --> 00:12:32.502 position:50% align:center
Let's begin the assault!

00:12:43.388 --> 00:12:44.431 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIER 311A]
Confirmed hit!

00:12:44.514 --> 00:12:46.808 position:50% align:center
The wall-type Neuroi
are unharmed.

00:12:46.891 --> 00:12:48.518 position:50% align:center
So the four and
a half inch rockets

00:12:48.601 --> 00:12:49.769 position:50% align:center
ain't gonna do it, huh?

00:12:49.853 --> 00:12:52.397 position:50% align:center
Patton Supertank Army,
here we go!

00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:54.524 position:50% align:center
Let's give 'em hell!

00:12:56.651 --> 00:12:59.404 position:50% align:center

Go! Go! Go! Go!

00:12:59.487 --> 00:13:01.281 position:50% align:center
Go!

00:13:02.407 --> 00:13:03.575 position:50% align:center
[FRANCESCA]
Ooh wee!

00:13:03.658 --> 00:13:05.994 position:50% align:center
[SHIRLEY]
Up close, it looks gigantic!

00:13:06.077 --> 00:13:07.203 position:50% align:center
Impressive!

00:13:07.287 --> 00:13:08.538 position:50% align:center
It's hard to believe
something that massive

00:13:08.621 --> 00:13:10.498 position:50% align:center
can actually move on land.

00:13:14.419 --> 00:13:16.379 position:50% align:center
The operation is underway.

00:13:19.299 --> 00:13:21.134 position:50% align:center
We are now within
firing range, sir!

00:13:21.217 --> 00:13:22.761 position:50% align:center
All right, give 'em
everything you've got

00:13:22.844 --> 00:13:23.720 position:50% align:center
and then some!

00:13:23.803 --> 00:13:24.888 position:50% align:center
Are you ready?

00:13:24.971 --> 00:13:26.973 position:50% align:center
Remember! Your top
priority is the Ratte!

[WITCHES]
Roger!

00:13:39.277 --> 00:13:41.946 position:50% align:center
[PERRINE] Hope the Ratte
can hold its own for a sec!

00:13:45.408 --> 00:13:47.160 position:50% align:center
Wait, is it
reflecting the beams?

00:13:47.243 --> 00:13:48.411 position:50% align:center
Excellent!

00:13:48.495 --> 00:13:51.247 position:50% align:center
How does that anti-Neuroi
sloped armor feel?

[SOLDIER 311C groaning]

00:14:05.804 --> 00:14:07.931 position:50% align:center
You should be fine now that
the bleeding has stopped.

00:14:08.014 --> 00:14:09.641 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIER 311C]
Thank you, Sergeant.

00:14:09.724 --> 00:14:11.142 position:50% align:center
Okay! How's that?

00:14:11.226 --> 00:14:12.102 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIER 311C]
It's good.

00:14:12.185 --> 00:14:13.269 position:50% align:center

Over here, medic!

'Kay!

We just need to get
into firing range

It's no problem!

Miyafuji could have
done better though.

00:15:14.247 --> 00:15:15.665 position:50% align:center
Oh, Hattori.

00:15:18.209 --> 00:15:19.502 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIER 311A] We passed
through the first point!

of that, sucker?

It isn't. Take a closer look.

00:15:55.538 --> 00:15:58.291 position:50% align:center
[PATTON] What the hell?
The wall's moving?

00:16:00.335 --> 00:16:01.795 position:50% align:center
You wanna play hardball?

00:16:01.878 --> 00:16:04.506 position:50% align:center
Get that second
round loaded! Now!

00:16:11.262 --> 00:16:12.305 position:50% align:center
[PATTON]
Damn you.

00:16:12.389 --> 00:16:14.057 position:50% align:center
You're really pushing
your luck, here!

00:16:14.140 --> 00:16:16.351 position:50% align:center
Fire main guns, now!

00:16:18.019 --> 00:16:19.437 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIKA]
Are you okay?

00:16:20.772 --> 00:16:22.565 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIKA]
Let me patch you up.

00:16:22.649 --> 00:16:24.234 position:50% align:center
Sergeant Miyafuji.

00:16:24.317 --> 00:16:25.735 position:50% align:center
Save your breath.

00:16:27.654 --> 00:16:28.947 position:50% align:center
That's the last one.

00:16:29.030 --> 00:16:30.240 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:16:30.323 --> 00:16:31.491 position:50% align:center
[MINNA]
What?

00:16:31.574 --> 00:16:33.451 position:50% align:center
[HARTMANN] Aw, no fair,
I thought we were done!

00:16:33.535 --> 00:16:34.452 position:50% align:center
We'll make them double-dead!

00:16:34.536 --> 00:16:35.745 position:50% align:center
[HARTMANN]
Roger!

00:16:39.249 --> 00:16:41.793 position:50% align:center
It's no good.
There are just too many!

00:16:43.211 --> 00:16:45.630 position:50% align:center
Don't let 'em get
a chance to counterattack!

00:16:45.714 --> 00:16:47.215 position:50% align:center
Fire!

00:16:53.847 --> 00:16:55.015 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIKA gasps]

00:16:56.641 --> 00:16:57.851 position:50% align:center
Blood?

00:16:57.934 --> 00:17:00.478 position:50% align:center
That's the command room.

00:17:00.562 --> 00:17:02.564 position:50% align:center
General, are you hurt?

00:17:02.647 --> 00:17:04.315 position:50% align:center
Oh, please,
it's barely a scratch.

00:17:04.399 --> 00:17:05.734 position:50% align:center
Don't get all worked up.

00:17:05.817 --> 00:17:07.193 position:50% align:center
--[YOSHIKA] But, sir--
--What kind of leader would I be

00:17:07.277 --> 00:17:08.778 position:50% align:center
if I just hid away in the back?

00:17:08.862 --> 00:17:11.072 position:50% align:center
A leader. Right, I understand.

00:17:11.156 --> 00:17:12.323 position:50% align:center
Let me stop the bleeding.

00:17:12.407 --> 00:17:14.034 position:50% align:center
I'm impressed you're
living up to your word

00:17:14.117 --> 00:17:15.994 position:50% align:center
and doing your part to help out.

00:17:16.077 --> 00:17:17.620 position:50% align:center
I like your gumption.

00:17:20.373 --> 00:17:21.708 position:50% align:center
[PERRINE]
Just three left!

00:17:21.791 --> 00:17:23.668 position:50% align:center
Open fire!

00:17:23.752 --> 00:17:25.378 position:50% align:center
Keep it up!

00:17:25.462 --> 00:17:26.671 position:50% align:center
Again!

00:17:33.511 --> 00:17:35.221 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIER 311A] All targets
have been destroyed!

00:17:35.305 --> 00:17:36.431 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIKA]
We did it!

00:17:36.514 --> 00:17:39.100 position:50% align:center
Now there's just one thing left.

00:17:39.184 --> 00:17:42.812 position:50% align:center
The big boss.
Once that bastard's down...

00:17:42.896 --> 00:17:44.272 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIKA]
...Berlin will be ours again!

00:17:44.356 --> 00:17:47.567 position:50% align:center
[PATTON]
That's right. Onward!

00:17:50.445 --> 00:17:52.030 position:50% align:center
[MINNA]
Follow the Ratte!

00:17:54.699 --> 00:17:56.159 position:50% align:center
There're still too many of them!

00:17:56.242 --> 00:17:58.661 position:50% align:center
This is gonna be
tricky moving forward!

00:18:01.331 --> 00:18:02.415 position:50% align:center
[BARKHORN]
No!

00:18:02.499 --> 00:18:04.876 position:50% align:center
They're going after the Ratte!

00:18:04.959 --> 00:18:09.798 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKA]
Sei... ya!

00:18:13.802 --> 00:18:15.261 position:50% align:center
That's Shizuka!

00:18:15.345 --> 00:18:16.554 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:18:16.638 --> 00:18:18.098 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIKA]
What's happening?

00:18:25.230 --> 00:18:27.982 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIKA]
The sky's being covered up.

00:18:28.066 --> 00:18:29.567 position:50% align:center
Shizuka, get out of there!

00:18:29.651 --> 00:18:30.860 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:18:32.946 --> 00:18:34.489 position:50% align:center
[screams]

00:18:34.572 --> 00:18:36.032 position:50% align:center
[LYNNE]
Hattori!

00:18:36.116 --> 00:18:37.117 position:50% align:center
Shizuka, no!

00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:39.077 position:50% align:center
[PATTON]
What the hell's goin' on?

00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:41.538 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIER 311A] The enemy has
regenerated and formed a dome!

00:18:41.621 --> 00:18:43.957 position:50% align:center
We've been cut off
from the 501st!

00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:44.958 position:50% align:center
We're surrounded?

00:18:45.041 --> 00:18:46.918 position:50% align:center
God dammit!

00:18:47.002 --> 00:18:49.379 position:50% align:center
[MINNA] We can't get
through to anyone inside.

00:18:49.462 --> 00:18:51.089 position:50% align:center
The Ratte is on its own.

00:18:51.172 --> 00:18:53.091 position:50% align:center
Damn! So it was another trap?

00:18:53.174 --> 00:18:54.509 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:18:54.592 --> 00:18:56.970 position:50% align:center
Are you doing okay, Hattori?

00:18:57.053 --> 00:19:00.265 position:50% align:center
I heard Miyafuji's voice.

00:19:00.348 --> 00:19:01.391 position:50% align:center
[SAKAMOTO]
What happened?

00:19:01.474 --> 00:19:03.018 position:50% align:center
They destroyed the
wall-type Neuroi,

00:19:03.101 --> 00:19:04.185 position:50% align:center
but it regenerated.

00:19:04.269 --> 00:19:06.187 position:50% align:center
It regenerated?!

00:19:08.398 --> 00:19:10.191 position:50% align:center
The main unit's within reach!

00:19:10.275 --> 00:19:12.610 position:50% align:center
We need to figure out
a way to gun it down!

00:19:12.694 --> 00:19:13.945 position:50% align:center
Fire!

00:19:22.037 --> 00:19:24.039 position:50% align:center
[PATTON]
Come on! Seriously?

00:19:24.122 --> 00:19:26.875 position:50% align:center
That damn thing used the
walls to stop a direct hit.

00:19:30.003 --> 00:19:30.754 position:50% align:center
[PATTON]
Hey, you.

00:19:30.837 --> 00:19:32.630 position:50% align:center
Contact the 501st, now!

00:19:32.714 --> 00:19:35.050 position:50% align:center
Sir! We're unable
to reach the outside!

00:19:35.133 --> 00:19:37.218 position:50% align:center
All just a trap to
lock us in here, huh?

00:19:37.302 --> 00:19:38.595 position:50% align:center
--Damn!
--[YOSHIKA] General!

00:19:38.678 --> 00:19:40.013 position:50% align:center
Idiot! Get inside!

00:19:40.096 --> 00:19:42.098 position:50% align:center
You think we can use
that building over there?

00:19:42.182 --> 00:19:43.224 position:50% align:center
What?

00:19:45.393 --> 00:19:46.728 position:50% align:center
[PATTON]
The flak tower?

00:19:46.811 --> 00:19:48.313 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIKA]
What's that?

00:19:48.396 --> 00:19:51.149 position:50% align:center
[PATTON] It's a giant concrete
fortress that was constructed

00:19:51.232 --> 00:19:54.110 position:50% align:center
long before the Neuroi
started to attack.

00:19:54.194 --> 00:19:56.613 position:50% align:center
I think we should
consider it, sir.

00:19:56.696 --> 00:19:58.698 position:50% align:center
[PATTON]
All right! Change of plans!

00:19:58.782 --> 00:20:01.242 position:50% align:center
To the flak tower!

00:20:01.326 --> 00:20:02.494 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:20:07.082 --> 00:20:09.250 position:50% align:center
[EILA] No use.
There's not even a scratch!

00:20:09.334 --> 00:20:10.835 position:50% align:center
Oh, no.

00:20:10.919 --> 00:20:13.880 position:50% align:center
I doubt the Ratte could survive
a concentrated attack in there.

00:20:13.963 --> 00:20:16.758 position:50% align:center
It might be too late
for us to help them.

00:20:16.841 --> 00:20:18.343 position:50% align:center
General Patton.

00:20:18.426 --> 00:20:21.179 position:50% align:center
[BRADLEY grunts]
I think this might be the end.

00:20:22.430 --> 00:20:23.431 position:50% align:center
[beeping]

00:20:23.515 --> 00:20:24.641 position:50% align:center
What's that?

00:20:24.724 --> 00:20:26.893 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIER 311B]
It's from... General Patton!

00:20:26.976 --> 00:20:28.311 position:50% align:center
What's it say?

00:20:33.316 --> 00:20:34.401 position:50% align:center
The wire.

00:20:34.484 --> 00:20:36.695 position:50% align:center
Lucky for us,
it's still up and running.

00:20:42.158 --> 00:20:45.453 position:50% align:center
[panting]

00:20:45.537 --> 00:20:47.288 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIER 311B] We've relocated
our base to the flak tower

00:20:47.372 --> 00:20:48.373 position:50% align:center
and are fighting back.

00:20:48.456 --> 00:20:50.083 position:50% align:center
Request immediate
reinforcements.

00:20:50.166 --> 00:20:52.711 position:50% align:center
Units confirmed inside
are General Patton,

00:20:52.794 --> 00:20:55.005 position:50% align:center
the tank column, and one Witch.

00:20:55.088 --> 00:20:56.214 position:50% align:center
Who is it?

00:20:56.297 --> 00:20:57.674 position:50% align:center
They're saying there's
a Witch in the dome.

00:20:57.757 --> 00:20:59.175 position:50% align:center
That's impossible!

00:20:59.259 --> 00:21:00.385 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKA]
It's Miyafuji!

00:21:00.468 --> 00:21:02.012 position:50% align:center
That's who they're
talking about!

00:21:02.095 --> 00:21:03.263 position:50% align:center
[SHIRLEY]
Why's she in there?

00:21:03.346 --> 00:21:05.598 position:50% align:center
Isn't she supposed to be
back in Kiel, though?

00:21:05.682 --> 00:21:06.975 position:50% align:center
You have to believe me!

00:21:07.058 --> 00:21:08.977 position:50% align:center
I know I heard her voice
come from the Ratte!

00:21:09.060 --> 00:21:10.854 position:50% align:center
Why the heck would she
be inside a tank?

00:21:10.937 --> 00:21:12.230 position:50% align:center
Are we missing something?

00:21:12.313 --> 00:21:13.773 position:50% align:center
I bet she wanted to help out

00:21:13.857 --> 00:21:15.775 position:50% align:center
even if she couldn't
join us up here.

00:21:15.859 --> 00:21:17.944 position:50% align:center
Do you suppose she
volunteered as a medic?

00:21:18.028 --> 00:21:19.029 position:50% align:center
For sure.

00:21:19.112 --> 00:21:20.572 position:50% align:center
That sounds like
something she'd do.

00:21:20.655 --> 00:21:22.157 position:50% align:center
Right? Trude.

00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:24.826 position:50% align:center
Agreed. There's no doubt.

00:21:24.909 --> 00:21:27.245 position:50% align:center
That's just like her!

00:21:27.328 --> 00:21:28.288 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIER 311G]
Sergeant Miyafuji!

00:21:28.371 --> 00:21:29.706 position:50% align:center
We could use your
assistance here!

00:21:29.789 --> 00:21:31.082 position:50% align:center
Got it!

00:21:31.166 --> 00:21:32.417 position:50% align:center
[SAKAMOTO]
Emergency order!

00:21:32.500 --> 00:21:34.753 position:50% align:center
We will be changing
our course, immediately!

00:21:34.836 --> 00:21:37.297 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIER 311H] Course change,
confirmed. Where to?

00:21:37.380 --> 00:21:40.508 position:50% align:center
Clear the way! Head to Berlin!

00:21:40.592 --> 00:21:43.803 position:50% align:center
[MINNA] A top-priority order has
come in from General Bradley.

00:21:43.887 --> 00:21:45.388 position:50% align:center
We are to recover
General Patton,

00:21:45.472 --> 00:21:47.807 position:50% align:center
the tank units and Miyafuji.

00:21:47.891 --> 00:21:49.142 position:50% align:center
All right?

00:21:49.225 --> 00:21:51.561 position:50% align:center
This has officially become
a rescue mission now.

00:21:51.644 --> 00:21:52.645 position:50% align:center
That sounds good to me.

00:21:52.729 --> 00:21:54.105 position:50% align:center
Yup!

00:21:54.189 --> 00:21:56.524 position:50% align:center
Question. How do you suggest
we get through that wall?

00:21:56.608 --> 00:21:58.193 position:50% align:center
Berlin's underground road.

00:21:58.276 --> 00:21:59.069 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:21:59.152 --> 00:22:01.988 position:50% align:center
Strike Witches, let's do this.

00:23:36.207 --> 00:23:38.418 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIKA]
When you feel like all is lost,

00:23:38.501 --> 00:23:43.506 position:50% align:center
cry out to the endless sky, and
it will surely hear your call.

00:23:43.590 --> 00:23:47.594 position:50% align:center
On the next <i>Strike Witches</i> :
the final episode!

"I Still Want to Protect"!
