[MINNA]
Neuroi attack!

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:13.596 position:50% align:center
Prepare for combat!

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:15.598 position:50% align:center
Our target is at 15,000 feet,

00:00:15.682 --> 00:00:18.268 position:50% align:center
moving at 350 knots
toward our base.

00:00:18.351 --> 00:00:21.146 position:50% align:center
You should encounter the enemy
in approximately 60 seconds

00:00:21.229 --> 00:00:23.148 position:50% align:center
in the sky above Terschelling!

00:00:23.231 --> 00:00:24.024 position:50% align:center

00:00:27.569 --> 00:00:29.696 position:50% align:center
Yoshika, no!

00:02:04.499 --> 00:02:06.001 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIKA]
I'm sorry.

00:02:06.084 --> 00:02:09.504 position:50% align:center
It looks like I haven't gotten
my magic back in order just yet.

00:02:09.587 --> 00:02:10.880 position:50% align:center
You can't be serious!

00:02:10.964 --> 00:02:12.507 position:50% align:center
Just yesterday,
your magic pressure

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:14.509 position:50% align:center
was performing perfectly!

00:02:14.592 --> 00:02:15.719 position:50% align:center
And during the battle
at Hamburg,

00:02:15.802 --> 00:02:17.220 position:50% align:center
you were flying
just like normal!

00:02:17.303 --> 00:02:19.597 position:50% align:center
What happened?

00:02:19.681 --> 00:02:22.517 position:50% align:center
Well, um, the doctors
explained it this way.

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:26.104 position:50% align:center
Magic power and magic
pressure are different.

00:02:26.187 --> 00:02:29.441 position:50% align:center
If magic power is water
building up in a tank.

00:02:29.524 --> 00:02:31.860 position:50% align:center
Then magic pressure is like
a pump that can draw out

00:02:31.943 --> 00:02:34.029 position:50% align:center
as much as you need
for the situation.

00:02:34.112 --> 00:02:36.656 position:50% align:center
Yoshika can control
her magic pressure now.

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:38.742 position:50% align:center
But the "pipe" that brings
in her magic power

00:02:38.825 --> 00:02:40.952 position:50% align:center
still isn't fixed,
which is why she's still

00:02:41.036 --> 00:02:43.246 position:50% align:center
experiencing so much trouble.

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:44.914 position:50% align:center
Now, when she
uses all her magic,

00:02:44.998 --> 00:02:49.252 position:50% align:center
it takes her a really long
time for her tank to refill.

00:02:49.336 --> 00:02:50.503 position:50% align:center
I think I get it.

00:02:50.587 --> 00:02:52.630 position:50% align:center
So even if her ability
to control it is back...

00:02:52.714 --> 00:02:54.382 position:50% align:center
...without her
magic power itself,

00:02:54.466 --> 00:02:56.217 position:50% align:center
she won't be able to fly.

00:02:56.301 --> 00:02:57.719 position:50% align:center
This is my fault.

00:02:57.802 --> 00:03:00.430 position:50% align:center
In the last fight, I pushed her
past her limits, didn't I?

00:03:00.513 --> 00:03:02.557 position:50% align:center
If we're gonna blame anyone,
then I'm probably

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.184 position:50% align:center
the person who
messed up the most.

00:03:04.267 --> 00:03:07.687 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIKA] No! You didn't
do anything wrong!

00:03:07.771 --> 00:03:08.938 position:50% align:center
In any case.

00:03:09.022 --> 00:03:11.316 position:50% align:center
Miyafuji needs to
recover her magic power.

00:03:11.399 --> 00:03:13.318 position:50% align:center
I want her to rest.

00:03:13.401 --> 00:03:16.029 position:50% align:center
We will all cover for
her. Is that clear?

00:03:16.112 --> 00:03:17.572 position:50% align:center
Clear as day.

00:03:25.663 --> 00:03:27.665 position:50% align:center
[LYNNE sighs]
That isn't right either.

00:03:27.749 --> 00:03:31.336 position:50% align:center
I need to find the one that
helps magic powers recover.

00:03:31.419 --> 00:03:34.381 position:50% align:center
[LYNNE sighs] Maybe I should've
asked Perrine for advice

00:03:34.464 --> 00:03:36.716 position:50% align:center
before I came to the forest.

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:40.095 position:50% align:center
[LYNNE]
Hang in there, Yoshika.

00:03:40.178 --> 00:03:41.930 position:50% align:center
I'll locate it for you!

00:03:43.139 --> 00:03:47.102 position:50% align:center
[LYNNE yelps]

00:03:47.185 --> 00:03:49.437 position:50% align:center
[LYNNE grunts]

00:03:49.521 --> 00:03:50.814 position:50% align:center
Ow.

00:03:55.568 --> 00:03:57.278 position:50% align:center
[LYNNE]
What's that?

00:04:03.284 --> 00:04:05.495 position:50% align:center
[SHIRLEY] You found this
weird pot in the woods?

00:04:05.578 --> 00:04:08.081 position:50% align:center
Wonder what it was doin'
all the way out there.

00:04:08.164 --> 00:04:12.252 position:50% align:center
[LYNNE] Seems like a
cultural artifact, maybe?

00:04:12.335 --> 00:04:14.629 position:50% align:center
Huh. Is there something
inside of it?

00:04:14.713 --> 00:04:15.714 position:50% align:center
I wanna look, too!

00:04:15.797 --> 00:04:16.965 position:50% align:center
Lemme see! Lemme see!

00:04:17.048 --> 00:04:19.634 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKA] How odd.
Seems ancient, doesn't it?

00:04:19.718 --> 00:04:22.470 position:50% align:center
Well, weird pot aside,
I'm glad you weren't hurt.

00:04:22.554 --> 00:04:24.514 position:50% align:center
Take someone with
you next time.

00:04:24.597 --> 00:04:25.974 position:50% align:center
Right. Sorry.

00:04:26.057 --> 00:04:28.101 position:50% align:center
Perhaps you should listen
to your own advice.

00:04:28.184 --> 00:04:29.269 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:04:29.352 --> 00:04:30.603 position:50% align:center
Gimme that!

00:04:30.687 --> 00:04:32.313 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIKA yelps]

00:04:33.356 --> 00:04:34.441 position:50% align:center
Oh, crap!

00:04:36.151 --> 00:04:37.652 position:50% align:center
Something's inside it!

00:04:37.736 --> 00:04:39.571 position:50% align:center
[gasps] What the heck?

00:04:39.654 --> 00:04:41.614 position:50% align:center
It looks like
a clay idol to me.

00:04:41.698 --> 00:04:42.866 position:50% align:center
Creepy.

00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:44.826 position:50% align:center
[laughs] This weird
statue's rack

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:46.703 position:50% align:center
is bigger than yours,
Perrine! See?

00:04:46.786 --> 00:04:48.580 position:50% align:center
I won't tolerate your lewdness!

00:04:48.663 --> 00:04:49.706 position:50% align:center
Now, now.

00:04:49.789 --> 00:04:51.082 position:50% align:center
How 'boutcha kneel
before the knockers.

00:04:51.166 --> 00:04:52.334 position:50% align:center
Don't fight the truth.

00:04:52.417 --> 00:04:54.044 position:50% align:center
[PERRINE]
Cut it out!

00:04:56.671 --> 00:04:57.881 position:50% align:center
Are you all right?

00:04:57.964 --> 00:04:59.007 position:50% align:center
[SHIRLEY]
What's wrong, Lucchini?

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:00.425 position:50% align:center
[PERRINE]
She's hurt!

00:05:00.508 --> 00:05:01.468 position:50% align:center
[FRANCESCA]

00:05:01.551 --> 00:05:02.802 position:50% align:center

[FRANCESCA screams]

00:05:06.931 --> 00:05:08.475 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:05:08.558 --> 00:05:09.768 position:50% align:center
I'm okay.

00:05:10.769 --> 00:05:12.896 position:50% align:center
[FRANCESCA]
Whatcha' guys staring for?

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:14.647 position:50% align:center
Uh. Are you sure
you're all right?

00:05:14.731 --> 00:05:16.691 position:50% align:center

00:05:16.775 --> 00:05:17.984 position:50% align:center

00:05:20.737 --> 00:05:22.197 position:50% align:center

So much bigger!

00:05:28.078 --> 00:05:29.996 position:50% align:center
What in the world
is going on here?

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:33.375 position:50% align:center
This is really hard
for me to believe!

00:05:33.458 --> 00:05:35.251 position:50% align:center
[laughs] That tickles!

00:05:35.335 --> 00:05:36.711 position:50% align:center
Miyafuji! What do you
think you're doing?

00:05:36.795 --> 00:05:37.796 position:50% align:center
Put those down!

00:05:37.879 --> 00:05:39.839 position:50% align:center
Uh, I couldn't help myself.

00:05:39.923 --> 00:05:41.049 position:50% align:center
Give it up, Hattori.

00:05:41.132 --> 00:05:42.175 position:50% align:center
She's always been like this.

00:05:42.258 --> 00:05:43.677 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:45.762 position:50% align:center
Huh? Um, Yoshika?

00:05:45.845 --> 00:05:46.638 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:05:46.721 --> 00:05:47.806 position:50% align:center
Look!

00:05:49.265 --> 00:05:51.059 position:50% align:center
[gasps] My ears and tail!

00:05:51.142 --> 00:05:53.895 position:50% align:center
Your magic suddenly
came back out of nowhere!

00:05:53.978 --> 00:05:55.605 position:50% align:center
Maybe not nowhere.

00:05:55.689 --> 00:05:57.273 position:50% align:center
I don't like your implication.

00:05:57.357 --> 00:05:58.900 position:50% align:center
Then you think it's
because you were

00:05:58.983 --> 00:06:01.069 position:50% align:center
touching Lucchini's
enlarged breasts?

00:06:01.152 --> 00:06:03.113 position:50% align:center
It can't be.
That's not possible.

00:06:03.196 --> 00:06:04.447 position:50% align:center

But it is.

[YOSHIKA]
It's floating!

00:06:12.455 --> 00:06:16.543 position:50% align:center
An offering! The fertility
priestess demands it.

00:06:16.626 --> 00:06:17.544 position:50% align:center
The heck?

00:06:17.627 --> 00:06:20.130 position:50% align:center
Who's she talking about?

00:06:20.213 --> 00:06:21.297 position:50% align:center
Hi-yah!

00:06:21.381 --> 00:06:22.340 position:50% align:center

just a bizarre dream.

They're all blossoming.

Did you see how
beautiful they are, Eila?

00:06:51.911 --> 00:06:54.289 position:50% align:center
I'm honestly kinda
jealous of the roses.

00:06:54.372 --> 00:06:57.542 position:50% align:center

00:07:29.032 --> 00:07:31.242 position:50% align:center

I feel sort of weird.

talking about, Eila?

00:07:53.973 --> 00:07:56.434 position:50% align:center
Can she actually make sense
of what Sanya's saying?

00:07:56.518 --> 00:07:57.936 position:50% align:center

After some research,

00:20:40.907 --> 00:20:43.493 position:50% align:center
we've learned that this idol
was used by ancient Witches

00:20:43.576 --> 00:20:46.413 position:50% align:center
as a part of an antiquated
fertility ritual.

00:20:46.496 --> 00:20:47.288 position:50% align:center

Not quite. She means crops.

00:20:49.165 --> 00:20:52.002 position:50% align:center
This old ritual needed
nine Witches and a priestess?

why we were chosen.

Miyafuji the priestess?

I'm just sayin'.

Please, cut that out, Eila.

00:21:02.095 --> 00:21:03.471 position:50% align:center
My guess?

00:21:03.555 --> 00:21:05.390 position:50% align:center
It's because Miyafuji was
the last one holding the pot

00:21:05.473 --> 00:21:07.767 position:50% align:center
before it popped open.

00:21:07.851 --> 00:21:09.185 position:50% align:center
I agree.

00:21:09.269 --> 00:21:11.354 position:50% align:center

large breasts brought
a fertile harvest.

00:21:27.746 --> 00:21:30.206 position:50% align:center
So if they're
a symbol of fertility,

00:21:30.290 --> 00:21:31.916 position:50% align:center
Could that, perhaps,
be the reason why

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:34.544 position:50% align:center
Miyafuji's magic came
back momentarily?

00:21:34.627 --> 00:21:35.795 position:50% align:center
No way.
