You mean the girl

00:04:23.138 --> 00:04:25.682 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIER 302A] All right, we've
got the Neuroi pinned down.

00:04:25.765 --> 00:04:27.058 position:50% align:center
Now where is our backup?

00:04:27.142 --> 00:04:29.561 position:50% align:center
No use. We just can't
get through, sir!

00:04:29.644 --> 00:04:32.063 position:50% align:center
The Neuroi are jamming
our signals, are they?

00:04:32.147 --> 00:04:34.941 position:50% align:center
Luckily, this fort can
stand fine on its own!

00:04:35.025 --> 00:04:38.111 position:50% align:center
We don't need support.

00:04:38.194 --> 00:04:39.279 position:50% align:center
[MECHANIC 302A]
A mess!

00:04:39.362 --> 00:04:41.031 position:50% align:center

Please fix it!

We don't have
Striker parts here.

00:04:48.997 --> 00:04:51.750 position:50% align:center
Best we can do for
right now is a tune-up.

00:04:51.833 --> 00:04:52.751 position:50% align:center
Give us some time.

00:04:52.834 --> 00:04:55.045 position:50% align:center

What's it going to do now?

00:05:28.787 --> 00:05:29.871 position:50% align:center
A direct hit!

00:05:29.954 --> 00:05:32.040 position:50% align:center
The fortress cannons
were destroyed, sir!

00:05:32.123 --> 00:05:34.459 position:50% align:center
The Neuroi launched
itself at the port!

00:05:34.542 --> 00:05:36.795 position:50% align:center
The enemy is a living explosive.

No way.

00:05:37.921 --> 00:05:39.422 position:50% align:center
[NAVY 302B]
A bomb-type Neuroi?

00:05:39.506 --> 00:05:41.216 position:50% align:center
We could never survive
a hit like that!

00:05:41.299 --> 00:05:43.093 position:50% align:center

Thanks, but that's enough!

00:05:49.766 --> 00:05:51.518 position:50% align:center
I gotta go back up!

00:05:51.601 --> 00:05:53.144 position:50% align:center
Huh? You're nuts!

00:05:53.228 --> 00:05:54.229 position:50% align:center
We barely even started on it!

Even if you could take off,
you'd just get shot right down!

out there right now,

00:05:59.359 --> 00:06:00.694 position:50% align:center

Seems to be ignoring us.

00:06:17.377 --> 00:06:19.170 position:50% align:center
And what direction
is it going?

00:06:19.254 --> 00:06:21.631 position:50% align:center
It's heading straight into
the mouth of the Scheldt.

00:06:21.715 --> 00:06:22.799 position:50% align:center
What a nightmare.

It's a pleasure to
meet you, Sergeant.

I'm Carlo Grimani,
the captain of the <i>Doge</i> .

You have a daughter
named Altia, right?

00:06:51.786 --> 00:06:53.329 position:50% align:center
Is Altia a friend of yours?

00:06:53.413 --> 00:06:54.914 position:50% align:center
Yes, sir!

00:06:54.998 --> 00:06:57.709 position:50% align:center
[CARLO] The iceberg Neuroi has
destroyed the fort on the coast,

00:06:57.792 --> 00:06:59.711 position:50% align:center
and now it's proceeding
down this waterway,

00:06:59.794 --> 00:07:01.129 position:50% align:center
straight to Antwerpen.

00:07:01.212 --> 00:07:02.839 position:50% align:center
The ship isn't
its actual target.

00:07:02.922 --> 00:07:04.507 position:50% align:center
So it stopped attacking us.

00:07:04.591 --> 00:07:06.301 position:50% align:center
Yes but the situation is dire.

[gasps]

00:07:07.719 --> 00:07:09.346 position:50% align:center
You see, the port in
Antwerpen is our military's

00:07:09.429 --> 00:07:10.930 position:50% align:center
most important supply base.

00:07:11.014 --> 00:07:13.641 position:50% align:center
So we can't let it fall
to the enemy, no matter what!

00:07:13.725 --> 00:07:15.643 position:50% align:center
But we can't stop
the Neuroi by ourselves.

00:07:15.727 --> 00:07:18.855 position:50% align:center
I'm afraid our ship's firepower
simply won't be enough.

The fight isn't over yet.

00:07:23.026 --> 00:07:26.196 position:50% align:center

we can get it to change targets.

We'll lure it out to open sea!

00:09:37.619 --> 00:09:40.330 position:50% align:center

Captain, someone's using

the deck elevator!

00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:17.761 position:50% align:center
What the--?

00:11:27.437 --> 00:11:28.688 position:50% align:center
[gasps] It's Miyafuji!

00:11:28.772 --> 00:11:29.898 position:50% align:center
Can she fly?

00:11:29.981 --> 00:11:32.025 position:50% align:center
Not perfect, but we
did what we could!

00:11:32.108 --> 00:11:34.027 position:50% align:center
The unit can fly,
but it'll stall out

00:11:34.110 --> 00:11:35.236 position:50% align:center
if you push it too hard!

00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:36.780 position:50% align:center

That didn't stop its momentum!

to shut down something this big!

Counterattack?

00:21:01.594 --> 00:21:03.221 position:50% align:center
That's right. Mankind has been

00:21:03.304 --> 00:21:05.682 position:50% align:center
on the defensive in this
battle for long enough.

00:21:05.765 --> 00:21:07.642 position:50% align:center
So now we're striking back.

00:21:07.726 --> 00:21:09.269 position:50% align:center
Our target will be...

00:21:09.352 --> 00:21:10.270 position:50% align:center
...Berlin.

00:21:10.353 --> 00:21:11.688 position:50% align:center
In Karlsland?

00:21:11.771 --> 00:21:13.106 position:50% align:center
We're taking the battle there?

00:21:13.189 --> 00:21:14.691 position:50% align:center
Uh-huh. To the capital!

00:21:14.774 --> 00:21:16.151 position:50% align:center
I've been waiting for this!

00:21:16.234 --> 00:21:17.777 position:50% align:center
You're ready to rumble, huh?

00:21:17.861 --> 00:21:19.195 position:50% align:center
Of course I am!

00:21:19.279 --> 00:21:21.906 position:50% align:center
It's finally an opportunity
to take our home back!

00:21:21.990 --> 00:21:23.533 position:50% align:center
We've done some reconnaissance.

00:21:23.616 --> 00:21:26.911 position:50% align:center
A powerful Neuroi nest was
found right above the city.

00:21:26.995 --> 00:21:29.289 position:50% align:center
This encounter will be
the most difficult battle

00:21:29.372 --> 00:21:30.874 position:50% align:center
that we've had yet.

00:21:30.957 --> 00:21:32.125 position:50% align:center
As you may know,

00:21:32.208 --> 00:21:34.836 position:50% align:center
Sakamoto is no longer
a part of our unit.

00:21:34.919 --> 00:21:38.131 position:50% align:center
Fortunately, Fuso has provided
us with a replacement.

00:21:38.214 --> 00:21:39.132 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIKA gasps]

00:21:39.215 --> 00:21:40.884 position:50% align:center
Hattori!

00:21:40.967 --> 00:21:42.135 position:50% align:center
Ma'am!

00:21:42.218 --> 00:21:45.513 position:50% align:center
Wow, Shizuka! You're
joining the 501st!

00:21:45.597 --> 00:21:46.848 position:50% align:center
That's right.

00:21:50.226 --> 00:21:53.938 position:50% align:center
[MINNA] Well, this turned out to
be a bit sudden, but as of now,

00:21:54.022 --> 00:21:58.651 position:50% align:center
the 501st Joint Fighter Wing
is officially reformed!

00:22:00.278 --> 00:22:01.446 position:50% align:center
[WITCHES]
Roger!

00:23:35.790 --> 00:23:38.126 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKA] To think that
I get to live with Miyafuji!

00:23:38.209 --> 00:23:39.836 position:50% align:center
[LYNNE] You're going
to love her miso soup!

00:23:39.919 --> 00:23:41.129 position:50% align:center
It's yummy!

00:23:41.212 --> 00:23:42.881 position:50% align:center
And she's cute
when she's sleeping!

00:23:42.964 --> 00:23:46.259 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKA] You two seem,
uh, awfully close.

00:23:46.343 --> 00:23:47.802 position:50% align:center
[LYNNE]
