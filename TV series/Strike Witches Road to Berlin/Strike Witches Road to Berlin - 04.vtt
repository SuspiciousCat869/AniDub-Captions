00:00:12.345 --> 00:00:17.183 position:50% align:center
Ensign Lucchini! Tea's ready!

00:00:17.267 --> 00:00:19.936 position:50% align:center
[snoring]

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:21.980 position:50% align:center
I don't have the pipes
to wake her up.

00:00:22.063 --> 00:00:24.315 position:50% align:center
There's no point
in us waiting for her.

00:00:26.568 --> 00:00:29.362 position:50% align:center
[sighs] Now that's good!

00:00:29.446 --> 00:00:31.781 position:50% align:center
Come and get a cup
before it cools off!

00:00:31.865 --> 00:00:33.074 position:50% align:center
[SHIRLEY growls]

00:00:33.158 --> 00:00:34.701 position:50% align:center
Hello, Shirley?

00:00:34.784 --> 00:00:37.370 position:50% align:center
[SHIRLEY growling]

00:00:37.454 --> 00:00:38.496 position:50% align:center
Seriously?!

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:40.999 position:50% align:center
[yelps]

00:00:41.082 --> 00:00:42.417 position:50% align:center
I've been topped!

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.128 position:50% align:center
[whines]

00:00:45.211 --> 00:00:46.880 position:50% align:center
What's the big idea?

00:00:46.963 --> 00:00:48.298 position:50% align:center
It's just terrible.

00:00:48.381 --> 00:00:49.382 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:00:49.466 --> 00:00:51.343 position:50% align:center
My record's been
shattered, somehow!

00:00:51.426 --> 00:00:53.094 position:50% align:center
Let's see.

00:00:53.178 --> 00:00:55.138 position:50% align:center
It says "A new world
record for the fastest

00:00:55.221 --> 00:00:58.266 position:50% align:center
under-1,000 cc motorbike
was set in Bonneville."

00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:59.684 position:50% align:center
So, does that mean

00:00:59.768 --> 00:01:01.936 position:50% align:center
you were the holder
of the last one, Shirley?

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:03.188 position:50% align:center
Exactly.

00:01:03.271 --> 00:01:06.358 position:50% align:center
I managed to hit a speed
of 183 miles per hour!

00:01:06.441 --> 00:01:08.318 position:50% align:center
The weather, temperature,
and motorcycle,

00:01:08.401 --> 00:01:10.236 position:50% align:center
were all perfect.
I thought for sure

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.156 position:50% align:center
I'd have that record locked down
for five, or even ten years!

00:01:13.239 --> 00:01:14.699 position:50% align:center
[growls]

00:01:14.783 --> 00:01:18.244 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKA] It looks like this
person barely beat it at 185.

00:01:18.328 --> 00:01:21.039 position:50% align:center
I ain't gonna let someone
snatch my title away!

00:01:21.122 --> 00:01:22.040 position:50% align:center
Whatcha gonna do?

00:01:22.123 --> 00:01:24.125 position:50% align:center
Set the record again, obviously!

00:01:24.209 --> 00:01:25.669 position:50% align:center
But you'd have to
go even faster.

00:01:25.752 --> 00:01:27.420 position:50% align:center
You sure you can do that?

00:01:27.504 --> 00:01:30.090 position:50% align:center
Yup! Confidently.

00:01:30.173 --> 00:01:31.633 position:50% align:center
Just watch!

00:01:31.716 --> 00:01:33.134 position:50% align:center
With this baby!

00:01:37.138 --> 00:01:40.058 position:50% align:center
Say hello to my partner
in world record-setting, Rapid!

00:01:40.141 --> 00:01:41.810 position:50% align:center
You're really gonna
use this old thing?

00:01:41.893 --> 00:01:43.812 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Don't be mean to her!

00:01:43.895 --> 00:01:45.855 position:50% align:center
All right, jeez. I'll back off.

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:48.566 position:50% align:center
[SHIRLEY]
Mm...

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:51.069 position:50% align:center
Okay, maybe she has
aged just a bit,

00:01:51.152 --> 00:01:52.570 position:50% align:center
but she's still solid.

00:01:52.654 --> 00:01:55.031 position:50% align:center
Wanna set the record
with me again, partner?

00:01:55.115 --> 00:01:56.658 position:50% align:center
Well? Whaddya say?

00:01:56.741 --> 00:01:59.452 position:50% align:center
Huh?! Are you
replacing me with her?

00:01:59.536 --> 00:02:02.372 position:50% align:center
[SHIRLEY laughs]
No, silly.

00:02:02.455 --> 00:02:05.166 position:50% align:center
Well, at any rate,
mark my words.

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.461 position:50% align:center
I'm not gonna let some
newfangled machine beat us!

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:45.767 position:50% align:center
[BARKHORN sighs]

00:03:51.523 --> 00:03:52.982 position:50% align:center
How much longer
do we have to wait

00:03:53.066 --> 00:03:54.943 position:50% align:center
before we can take back Berlin?

00:03:55.026 --> 00:03:57.112 position:50% align:center
You can thank the
iceberg-type Neuroi.

00:03:57.195 --> 00:03:59.656 position:50% align:center
Look, we can't resume the plan
until Antwerpen's port

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:00.907 position:50% align:center
is fully operational again.

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:02.117 position:50% align:center
Seriously?!

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:05.412 position:50% align:center
But being on standby
only helps the Neuroi!

00:04:05.495 --> 00:04:07.997 position:50% align:center
[MINNA] The situation could
have ended a lot worse.

00:04:08.081 --> 00:04:10.041 position:50% align:center
Lucky we had Miyafuji.

00:04:16.423 --> 00:04:19.551 position:50% align:center
[BARKHORN] Will that help
stabilize her magical pressure?

00:04:19.634 --> 00:04:20.844 position:50% align:center
The doctor isn't sure

00:04:20.927 --> 00:04:23.263 position:50% align:center
what'll get her back
to normal, unfortunately.

00:04:28.268 --> 00:04:29.394 position:50% align:center
[MINNA]
Your tea, Captain.

00:04:29.477 --> 00:04:30.395 position:50% align:center
Uh--

00:04:30.478 --> 00:04:31.521 position:50% align:center
[MINNA laughs]

00:04:31.604 --> 00:04:32.897 position:50% align:center
[knocking]

00:04:32.981 --> 00:04:34.399 position:50% align:center
It's open.

00:04:34.482 --> 00:04:35.859 position:50% align:center
[PERRINE]
Pardon my intrusion,

00:04:35.942 --> 00:04:38.945 position:50% align:center
but some supplies
have arrived just now.

00:04:39.029 --> 00:04:41.823 position:50% align:center
[BARKHORN] What are these?
Unit parts, maybe?

00:04:41.906 --> 00:04:43.199 position:50% align:center
Afraid not.

00:04:43.283 --> 00:04:46.202 position:50% align:center
They seem to be unrelated
to any of our equipment.

00:04:46.286 --> 00:04:47.704 position:50% align:center
Who the hell ordered this crap?

00:04:47.787 --> 00:04:51.916 position:50% align:center
Oh! Are they here already?
That's gotta be my new mufflers!

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.793 position:50% align:center
So this junk is yours, huh?

00:04:53.877 --> 00:04:54.919 position:50% align:center
Yeah, obviously!

00:04:55.003 --> 00:04:57.005 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna swap 'em
out with hers!

00:04:57.088 --> 00:04:58.798 position:50% align:center
These straight mufflers
are definitely

00:04:58.882 --> 00:05:00.508 position:50% align:center
gonna help her reach top speeds!

00:05:00.592 --> 00:05:02.010 position:50% align:center
What is wrong with you, Shirley?

00:05:02.093 --> 00:05:04.262 position:50% align:center
Did you somehow forget we're
on the front line of a war?

00:05:04.346 --> 00:05:06.931 position:50% align:center
[gasps] She looks angry.

00:05:07.015 --> 00:05:08.350 position:50% align:center
Honestly!

00:05:08.433 --> 00:05:11.186 position:50% align:center
Regardless, the newest Unit
should be arriving soon.

00:05:11.269 --> 00:05:13.772 position:50% align:center
Even with the Jet Strikers
being taken off the table,

00:05:13.855 --> 00:05:15.148 position:50% align:center
this should serve
as an excellent re--

00:05:15.231 --> 00:05:16.232 position:50% align:center
[SHIRLEY, FRANCESCA]
Sneak...

00:05:16.316 --> 00:05:17.150 position:50% align:center
[SHIRLEY]
She noticed!

00:05:17.233 --> 00:05:17.984 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
Go!

00:05:18.068 --> 00:05:20.445 position:50% align:center
Come here! Hey!

00:05:21.529 --> 00:05:24.199 position:50% align:center
[SHIRLEY] Man, why is she
always such a hard ass?

00:05:24.282 --> 00:05:26.034 position:50% align:center
[FRANCESCA]
She could cut us some slack.

00:05:26.117 --> 00:05:27.619 position:50% align:center
Whatever.

00:05:27.702 --> 00:05:30.246 position:50% align:center
Barkhorn just doesn't understand
other people's hopes and dreams!

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:32.123 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna make you
the fastest wittle bike

00:05:32.207 --> 00:05:33.917 position:50% align:center
in the world, yes I am!

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.460 position:50% align:center
[FRANCESCA giggles]

00:05:43.968 --> 00:05:45.261 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:05:54.604 --> 00:05:57.399 position:50% align:center
[FRANCESCA]
Shirley! What'd ya clock?

00:05:57.482 --> 00:05:58.775 position:50% align:center
[SHIRLEY]
I hit 180.

00:05:58.858 --> 00:06:00.276 position:50% align:center
Got the same on my end.

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:03.154 position:50% align:center
That's awful! I'm way too slow!

00:06:03.238 --> 00:06:05.990 position:50% align:center
I should've known such
a simple fix wouldn't cut it.

00:06:06.074 --> 00:06:07.117 position:50% align:center
[FRANCESCA]
Are ya gonna give up?

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:09.536 position:50% align:center
No way. There's still
a lot I can mod.

00:06:09.619 --> 00:06:12.831 position:50% align:center
And I think I'll start with
a total engine overhaul!

00:06:12.914 --> 00:06:14.249 position:50% align:center
You can count me in!

00:06:14.332 --> 00:06:15.291 position:50% align:center
Are you sure?

00:06:15.375 --> 00:06:16.960 position:50% align:center
You'll get in more
trouble though.

00:06:17.043 --> 00:06:18.920 position:50% align:center
I'd love to help you out.

00:06:20.338 --> 00:06:21.798 position:50% align:center
[SHIRLEY]
Ya know...

00:06:21.881 --> 00:06:24.634 position:50% align:center
Back in Liberion, I was able
to up Rapid's speed by creating

00:06:24.718 --> 00:06:27.429 position:50% align:center
my own cylinder head
completely from scratch.

00:06:27.512 --> 00:06:29.389 position:50% align:center
But first, I had to learn
how to do that, which wasn't e--

00:06:29.472 --> 00:06:30.223 position:50% align:center
[yawns]

00:06:30.306 --> 00:06:32.225 position:50% align:center
Hey, are you even listening?

00:06:32.308 --> 00:06:35.103 position:50% align:center
Sorry, but all this junk
is hard for me to follow.

00:06:35.186 --> 00:06:37.105 position:50% align:center
That's exactly why
I'm explaining it.

00:06:37.188 --> 00:06:38.273 position:50% align:center
But it's boring!

00:06:38.356 --> 00:06:39.649 position:50% align:center
This is killing me
how dull this crap is!

00:06:39.733 --> 00:06:41.943 position:50% align:center
All right, all right already.

00:06:42.027 --> 00:06:43.778 position:50% align:center
Look. Let's put the engine in.

00:06:43.862 --> 00:06:45.655 position:50% align:center
Can ya give me a hand?

00:06:45.739 --> 00:06:47.157 position:50% align:center
Okay!

00:06:53.329 --> 00:06:54.664 position:50% align:center
[EILA]
Hm?

00:06:54.748 --> 00:06:56.916 position:50% align:center
It sounds like there's someone
working in the hangar.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.127 position:50% align:center
What are they doing
at this hour?

00:07:03.256 --> 00:07:05.050 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:07:05.133 --> 00:07:07.552 position:50% align:center
[EILA]
Burning the midnight oil?

00:07:07.635 --> 00:07:09.721 position:50% align:center
[SHIRLEY]
Yup! You on night patrol?

00:07:09.804 --> 00:07:10.889 position:50% align:center
Uh-huh.

00:07:10.972 --> 00:07:13.141 position:50% align:center
Making some modifications
to your bike?

00:07:13.224 --> 00:07:14.642 position:50% align:center
You guessed it!

00:07:14.726 --> 00:07:17.479 position:50% align:center
I'm taking my world record back
before we head to Berlin!

00:07:17.562 --> 00:07:20.231 position:50% align:center
Okay, why a motorbike
of all things, huh?

00:07:20.315 --> 00:07:21.858 position:50% align:center
Wouldn't flying be faster?

00:07:21.941 --> 00:07:23.276 position:50% align:center
Hold it right there!

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:25.653 position:50% align:center
That's not what
all of this is about!

00:07:25.737 --> 00:07:27.405 position:50% align:center
[EILA]
Why don't you fill us in, then?

00:07:27.489 --> 00:07:29.115 position:50% align:center
You should give her a spin.

00:07:29.199 --> 00:07:32.952 position:50% align:center
Eh. I'm good. I don't
need to understand.

00:07:46.341 --> 00:07:48.927 position:50% align:center
[squeals] That was it!
That was it!

00:07:49.010 --> 00:07:51.429 position:50% align:center
I clocked you going 188!

00:07:51.513 --> 00:07:53.098 position:50% align:center
You beat their time!

00:07:53.181 --> 00:07:54.599 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I suppose I did.

00:07:54.683 --> 00:07:56.810 position:50% align:center
You blew the record
outta the water!

00:07:56.893 --> 00:07:59.187 position:50% align:center
Only 188 miles per hour.

00:07:59.270 --> 00:08:02.565 position:50% align:center
Something wrong with that?
You don't seem happy.

00:08:02.649 --> 00:08:03.441 position:50% align:center
[SHIRLEY]
It's not good enough.

00:08:03.525 --> 00:08:04.275 position:50% align:center
[FRANCESCA]
Huh?

00:08:04.359 --> 00:08:05.610 position:50% align:center
We're just getting started.

00:08:05.694 --> 00:08:09.322 position:50% align:center
I can't lose again.
I need an unbeatable record.

00:08:09.406 --> 00:08:10.949 position:50% align:center
What's the new plan, then?

00:08:11.032 --> 00:08:13.702 position:50% align:center
It's simple. Shoot for 200!

00:08:13.785 --> 00:08:16.037 position:50% align:center
Huh? As in miles per hour?

00:08:16.121 --> 00:08:17.997 position:50% align:center
Is that even possible?

00:08:18.081 --> 00:08:19.165 position:50% align:center
Bet your ass it is!

00:08:19.249 --> 00:08:20.667 position:50% align:center
I'm not sure about that.

00:08:20.750 --> 00:08:23.211 position:50% align:center
The book I was reading
yesterday said you couldn't.

00:08:23.294 --> 00:08:26.673 position:50% align:center
I won't let you or anyone
put a speed limit on me!

00:08:26.756 --> 00:08:29.759 position:50% align:center
[FRANCESCA gasps]
That was cool.

00:08:29.843 --> 00:08:32.053 position:50% align:center
You're so awesome, Shirley!

00:08:32.137 --> 00:08:33.930 position:50% align:center
Heh. All right,
shall we get back--

00:08:34.014 --> 00:08:37.559 position:50% align:center
[alarm blares]

00:08:37.642 --> 00:08:39.352 position:50% align:center
[MINNA]
A Neuroi has been detected!

00:08:39.436 --> 00:08:42.522 position:50% align:center
All Witches on standby
are to engage at once!

00:08:42.605 --> 00:08:43.648 position:50% align:center
I repeat!

00:08:43.732 --> 00:08:46.026 position:50% align:center
Witches on standby,
engage at once!

00:08:46.109 --> 00:08:48.361 position:50% align:center
Dammit! It had to be now!

00:08:57.287 --> 00:08:58.621 position:50% align:center
[BARKHORN]
Over there!

00:09:02.709 --> 00:09:03.835 position:50% align:center
[growls]

00:09:10.592 --> 00:09:11.885 position:50% align:center
[EILA]
Whoa!

00:09:12.886 --> 00:09:13.970 position:50% align:center
[HARTMANN]
Gotcha!

00:09:20.310 --> 00:09:21.102 position:50% align:center
That was quick!

00:09:21.186 --> 00:09:22.937 position:50% align:center
How did it accelerate like that?

00:09:23.021 --> 00:09:23.980 position:50% align:center
Look up ahead!

00:09:24.064 --> 00:09:25.982 position:50% align:center
I think it's aiming
for the base!

00:09:26.066 --> 00:09:27.275 position:50% align:center
[BARKHORN]
After it, Hartmann!

00:09:27.359 --> 00:09:28.360 position:50% align:center
[HARTMANN]
On it!

00:09:31.488 --> 00:09:33.031 position:50% align:center
Now eat this!

00:09:34.824 --> 00:09:36.159 position:50% align:center
[groans]

00:09:36.242 --> 00:09:38.370 position:50% align:center
Even Eila couldn't land a hit?

00:09:49.172 --> 00:09:51.758 position:50% align:center
[BARKHORN] A high-speed
bomber-type Neuroi?

00:09:51.841 --> 00:09:53.301 position:50% align:center
It's withdrawing.

00:09:53.385 --> 00:09:55.345 position:50% align:center
Retreating beyond
scouting range.

00:09:55.428 --> 00:09:57.514 position:50% align:center
It's moving way too
fast to pursue.

00:09:57.597 --> 00:09:59.140 position:50% align:center
We can't catch it.

00:10:02.435 --> 00:10:03.228 position:50% align:center
[SHIRLEY]
You okay?

00:10:03.311 --> 00:10:04.437 position:50% align:center
[FRANCESCA]
Yeah.

00:10:22.664 --> 00:10:24.374 position:50% align:center
[SHIRLEY]
It got us pretty good, huh?

00:10:24.457 --> 00:10:28.461 position:50% align:center
It's gonna take a long time
to clean up this mess.

00:10:28.545 --> 00:10:31.798 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKA] Today we'll be going
over basic broom training!

00:10:31.881 --> 00:10:33.258 position:50% align:center
Do you think we
should be doing this,

00:10:33.341 --> 00:10:34.676 position:50% align:center
given the situation?

00:10:34.759 --> 00:10:36.845 position:50% align:center
The "situation" is
why we need this!

00:10:36.928 --> 00:10:39.431 position:50% align:center
We have to get
battle ready and fast!

00:10:40.682 --> 00:10:43.435 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKA]
Here... goes!

00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:48.356 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIKA gasps]

00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:50.775 position:50% align:center
'Kay, you're up, Miyafuji!

00:10:50.859 --> 00:10:52.861 position:50% align:center
All right! I'll do my best!

00:10:52.944 --> 00:10:57.073 position:50% align:center
[yells]

00:10:58.533 --> 00:11:01.786 position:50% align:center

00:11:07.834 --> 00:11:13.757 position:50% align:center
[yelling]

00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:15.759 position:50% align:center
--[SHIZUKA] Miyafuji!
--[LYNNE] Yoshika!

00:11:21.431 --> 00:11:23.350 position:50% align:center
Ah. She's okay.

00:11:23.433 --> 00:11:24.976 position:50% align:center
That was kinda weird.

00:11:25.060 --> 00:11:27.771 position:50% align:center
I swear I was transferring
my magic right.

00:11:27.854 --> 00:11:30.607 position:50% align:center
[airplane humming]

00:11:32.776 --> 00:11:34.319 position:50% align:center
What's that for?

00:11:37.030 --> 00:11:39.240 position:50% align:center
The unit has finally arrived.

00:11:39.324 --> 00:11:43.078 position:50% align:center
[BARKHORN] The P51H. It's an
upgraded version of the P51D.

00:11:43.161 --> 00:11:46.414 position:50% align:center
This'll be able to keep up with
that Neuroi's speed bursts.

00:11:46.498 --> 00:11:48.333 position:50% align:center
[SHIRLEY]
The new model's here?

00:11:48.416 --> 00:11:49.542 position:50% align:center
[BARKHORN]
Yes. Just came.

00:11:49.626 --> 00:11:50.794 position:50% align:center
Is it fast?

00:11:50.877 --> 00:11:53.713 position:50% align:center
In terms of raw speed,
Jet Units are faster.

00:11:53.797 --> 00:11:55.965 position:50% align:center
Acceleration is where
this thing shines.

00:11:56.049 --> 00:11:58.593 position:50% align:center
And it can hit top
speeds in no time flat.

00:11:58.677 --> 00:12:02.138 position:50% align:center
I really love this airframe!
So, who flies this bad boy?

00:12:02.222 --> 00:12:03.181 position:50% align:center
That would be you.

00:12:03.264 --> 00:12:05.350 position:50% align:center
It's going to replace
your D-type.

00:12:05.433 --> 00:12:06.893 position:50% align:center
Huh? But I like mine.

00:12:06.976 --> 00:12:08.937 position:50% align:center
Come on. What if
I wanna keep it?

00:12:09.020 --> 00:12:10.355 position:50% align:center
Can't we find someone else?

00:12:10.438 --> 00:12:12.148 position:50% align:center
You're fully aware that
you're the only one

00:12:12.232 --> 00:12:13.608 position:50% align:center
who can make full
use of this Unit.

00:12:13.692 --> 00:12:14.776 position:50% align:center
I'm jealous!

00:12:14.859 --> 00:12:17.195 position:50% align:center
Supplies from Liberion
get here so quick!

00:12:17.278 --> 00:12:18.988 position:50% align:center
How about if we let
Francesca use it?

00:12:19.072 --> 00:12:21.074 position:50% align:center
You're going to fly it,
and that is final!

00:12:21.157 --> 00:12:22.784 position:50% align:center
If you accept,
I'll look the other way

00:12:22.867 --> 00:12:24.452 position:50% align:center
concerning the matter
of the motorbike.

00:12:24.536 --> 00:12:27.163 position:50% align:center
Uh! Count on me! I love it!

00:12:27.247 --> 00:12:29.040 position:50% align:center
I'll fly the crap out of it!

00:12:29.124 --> 00:12:30.875 position:50% align:center
So now she changes her mind?

00:12:30.959 --> 00:12:32.794 position:50% align:center
It's going to be so nice
to work with you,

00:12:32.877 --> 00:12:39.634 position:50% align:center
my lovely H-type Unit!
Oh, your skin is so smooth!

00:12:41.386 --> 00:12:44.431 position:50% align:center
[SHIRLEY yawns]

00:12:47.559 --> 00:12:49.310 position:50% align:center
Good Morning, Shirley!

00:12:49.394 --> 00:12:51.479 position:50% align:center
Francesca! Aren't you up early?

00:12:51.563 --> 00:12:54.065 position:50% align:center
Sure am! Actually,
I have a little surprise

00:12:54.149 --> 00:12:55.567 position:50% align:center
I want to give you!

00:12:55.650 --> 00:12:56.693 position:50% align:center
All I'm saying is

00:12:56.776 --> 00:12:58.486 position:50% align:center
it better not be
another weird insect.

00:12:58.570 --> 00:13:00.989 position:50% align:center
What's wrong with that?
Come on! Just follow me!

00:13:01.072 --> 00:13:02.741 position:50% align:center
[SHIRLEY]
O-Okay.

00:13:02.824 --> 00:13:03.992 position:50% align:center
Ta-dah!

00:13:04.075 --> 00:13:05.702 position:50% align:center
Uh...

00:13:12.167 --> 00:13:13.293 position:50% align:center
I'm calling this puppy

00:13:13.376 --> 00:13:15.587 position:50% align:center
the "Shirley and
Lucchini Special"!

00:13:15.670 --> 00:13:17.255 position:50% align:center
Forget 200 miles per hour!

00:13:17.339 --> 00:13:21.718 position:50% align:center
Now you'll clear 300,
easy-peasy!

00:13:21.801 --> 00:13:25.430 position:50% align:center
Y-You've defiled
my darling Rapid.

00:13:25.513 --> 00:13:27.599 position:50% align:center
What in the hell
did you do to her?

00:13:27.682 --> 00:13:30.352 position:50% align:center
Wait, whatcha mean?
I made her super-duper fast now!

00:13:30.435 --> 00:13:32.270 position:50% align:center
I'm going for a
motorcycle record!

00:13:32.354 --> 00:13:33.646 position:50% align:center
You can't stick
propellers on her!

00:13:33.730 --> 00:13:35.023 position:50% align:center
What's wrong with
a speed boost?

00:13:35.106 --> 00:13:36.149 position:50% align:center
It isn't a big deal!

00:13:36.232 --> 00:13:38.818 position:50% align:center
It's a huge deal!

00:13:38.902 --> 00:13:41.613 position:50% align:center
You don't have to yell.
I was just trying to help out.

00:13:41.696 --> 00:13:45.325 position:50% align:center
I'd be better off
without help like this!

00:13:45.408 --> 00:13:47.243 position:50% align:center
--[FRANCESCA] Rude!
--What?

00:13:47.327 --> 00:13:50.038 position:50% align:center
You're a big meanie!

00:13:50.121 --> 00:13:52.123 position:50% align:center
You're being a
stupid spoiled brat!

00:13:52.207 --> 00:13:53.458 position:50% align:center
Lucchini?

00:13:53.541 --> 00:13:55.960 position:50% align:center
Ugh. Damn it!

00:14:01.049 --> 00:14:03.218 position:50% align:center
You really sure you should
be eating that much?

00:14:03.301 --> 00:14:04.678 position:50% align:center
[muffled] Maybe eating
a lot will make

00:14:04.761 --> 00:14:07.472 position:50% align:center
my magic pressure
go back to normal!

00:14:07.555 --> 00:14:09.015 position:50% align:center
You think?

00:14:09.099 --> 00:14:11.851 position:50% align:center
Why is Flight Lieutenant
Yeager skipping lunch?

00:14:14.354 --> 00:14:15.522 position:50% align:center
Lucchini?

00:14:15.605 --> 00:14:16.898 position:50% align:center
I'm all done!

00:14:16.981 --> 00:14:18.233 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:14:21.528 --> 00:14:24.989 position:50% align:center
[HARTMANN] Maybe they both
have tummy aches?

00:14:25.073 --> 00:14:27.534 position:50% align:center
[FRANCESCA]
Big, stupid, mean Shirley.

00:14:27.617 --> 00:14:31.413 position:50% align:center
So big. So stupid. So mean.

00:14:31.496 --> 00:14:35.125 position:50% align:center
Poopy-headed bully!
That jerk-face!

00:14:35.208 --> 00:14:36.960 position:50% align:center
Hey, Lucchini.

00:14:37.043 --> 00:14:38.503 position:50% align:center
[FRANCESCA]
Whacha want?

00:14:38.586 --> 00:14:40.630 position:50% align:center
[BARKHORN] Are you just going
to leave Shirley all alone?

00:14:40.714 --> 00:14:41.881 position:50% align:center
[FRANCESCA]
Yeah. She doesn't need me

00:14:41.965 --> 00:14:44.175 position:50% align:center
anyway, apparently!

00:14:47.595 --> 00:14:48.638 position:50% align:center
Ah!

00:14:48.722 --> 00:14:49.889 position:50% align:center
That turned out nice!

00:14:49.973 --> 00:14:51.975 position:50% align:center
Yeah, it did. I worked
really hard on this

00:14:52.058 --> 00:14:53.393 position:50% align:center
to get it just right!

00:14:53.476 --> 00:14:54.894 position:50% align:center
How about if you
added two wings

00:14:54.978 --> 00:14:56.688 position:50% align:center
and some propellers to it, then?

00:14:56.771 --> 00:14:58.732 position:50% align:center
That'd make it look
even cooler, you know.

00:14:58.815 --> 00:15:01.818 position:50% align:center
No, thank you. Are you
trying to mess it up?

00:15:01.901 --> 00:15:03.653 position:50% align:center
What d'you mean?

00:15:03.737 --> 00:15:06.114 position:50% align:center
Well, I like it like this.

00:15:08.116 --> 00:15:09.284 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:15:10.368 --> 00:15:12.245 position:50% align:center
Now you get it, don't you?

00:15:27.635 --> 00:15:30.680 position:50% align:center
[FRANCESCA]
Shirley. I wanted to--

00:15:30.764 --> 00:15:32.265 position:50% align:center
[SHIRLEY]
I'm sorry.

00:15:32.349 --> 00:15:34.225 position:50% align:center
I know you tried your
best to improve my bike.

00:15:34.309 --> 00:15:36.394 position:50% align:center
I shouldn't've been
mean to you like that.

00:15:36.478 --> 00:15:38.313 position:50% align:center
But I thought you hated
the new mods?

00:15:38.396 --> 00:15:40.899 position:50% align:center
You got super angry at me.

00:15:40.982 --> 00:15:43.068 position:50% align:center
[SHIRLEY]
You were only trying to help.

00:15:43.151 --> 00:15:45.528 position:50% align:center
Yeah, you made Rapid
look weird as hell,

00:15:45.612 --> 00:15:47.280 position:50% align:center
but ya meant well.

00:15:47.364 --> 00:15:49.074 position:50% align:center
Thank you, Shirley.

00:15:50.116 --> 00:15:54.454 position:50% align:center
[sighs] You said that 200
on this bike was impossible.

00:15:54.537 --> 00:15:55.622 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I did.

00:15:55.705 --> 00:15:57.624 position:50% align:center
You actually weren't
wrong, though.

00:15:57.707 --> 00:16:00.126 position:50% align:center
She only has a 1,000 cc engine.

00:16:00.210 --> 00:16:02.587 position:50% align:center
Pushing her that hard
would be ridiculous.

00:16:02.671 --> 00:16:04.547 position:50% align:center
Honestly. It's just facts.

00:16:04.631 --> 00:16:05.882 position:50% align:center
[FRANCESCA]
Ya think?

00:16:05.965 --> 00:16:08.009 position:50% align:center
If it weren't for Rapid,
I might not be here today.

00:16:08.093 --> 00:16:09.302 position:50% align:center
[FRANCESCA gasps]

00:16:09.386 --> 00:16:10.720 position:50% align:center
[SHIRLEY] I grew up
in the middle of nowhere.

00:16:10.804 --> 00:16:12.722 position:50% align:center
My bike was all
I had going for me.

00:16:12.806 --> 00:16:15.100 position:50% align:center
Without her, I wouldn't
have joined the military,

00:16:15.183 --> 00:16:17.936 position:50% align:center
and more importantly,
I never would've met you.

00:16:18.019 --> 00:16:19.521 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:16:19.604 --> 00:16:21.523 position:50% align:center
But she was the start
of my new life.

00:16:21.606 --> 00:16:24.526 position:50% align:center
I owe her, so I want us
to set the record again.

00:16:24.609 --> 00:16:27.028 position:50% align:center
Even if others say
it can't be done.

00:16:28.154 --> 00:16:30.657 position:50% align:center
If we don't chase our dreams,
then we'll lose 'em!

00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:31.658 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:16:31.741 --> 00:16:34.411 position:50% align:center
You're the one who
taught me that!

00:16:34.494 --> 00:16:36.538 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah! I was right!

00:16:36.621 --> 00:16:39.332 position:50% align:center
But I can't believe you
remembered me saying that!

00:16:39.416 --> 00:16:41.501 position:50% align:center
Now, then!

00:16:41.584 --> 00:16:43.712 position:50% align:center
Guess I should retune
everything from square one!

00:16:43.795 --> 00:16:45.213 position:50% align:center
Tell me how I can help out!

00:16:45.296 --> 00:16:47.298 position:50% align:center
Yeah? Okay then.

00:17:18.329 --> 00:17:19.748 position:50% align:center
[FRANCESCA, SHIRLEY]
All done!

00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:25.045 position:50% align:center
Let's go get some sleep.
We'll test her out tomorrow.

00:17:25.128 --> 00:17:26.296 position:50% align:center
[FRANCESCA]
Aw!

00:17:26.379 --> 00:17:27.672 position:50% align:center
We're gonna need
plenty of stamina

00:17:27.756 --> 00:17:29.257 position:50% align:center
if we wanna challenge
that record.

00:17:29.341 --> 00:17:32.177 position:50% align:center
Always good to reenergize
before a tough fight!

00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:36.389 position:50% align:center
[squeals] I'm pumped!
I won't be able to sleep!

00:17:36.473 --> 00:17:40.477 position:50% align:center
[snoring]

00:17:48.860 --> 00:17:51.321 position:50% align:center
I think I'm the one
who can't sleep.

00:17:53.114 --> 00:17:56.326 position:50% align:center
[alarm blares]

00:17:56.409 --> 00:17:58.995 position:50% align:center
[MAN 303A] Neuroi detected!
Approaching at high speed!

00:17:59.079 --> 00:18:01.498 position:50% align:center
It's likely to be the
same type as the last one!

00:18:01.581 --> 00:18:03.500 position:50% align:center
It's not getting away this time.

00:18:06.002 --> 00:18:08.922 position:50% align:center
[SHIRLEY sighs]
Aw, dang it.

00:18:09.005 --> 00:18:12.258 position:50% align:center
Guess I won't be setting
that record today.

00:18:12.342 --> 00:18:13.927 position:50% align:center
Where did she go?

00:18:15.387 --> 00:18:17.305 position:50% align:center
[SHIRLEY] Perrine!
Have you seen Francesca?

00:18:17.389 --> 00:18:20.058 position:50% align:center
[PERRINE] Yes. I believe
she just headed into battle.

00:18:20.141 --> 00:18:21.601 position:50% align:center
She did what?

00:18:25.271 --> 00:18:27.107 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIKA grunting]

00:18:27.190 --> 00:18:28.108 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKA]
Miyafuji!

00:18:28.191 --> 00:18:29.943 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIKA]
It's happening again!

00:18:31.236 --> 00:18:33.029 position:50% align:center
Looks like she's still
having trouble!

00:18:33.113 --> 00:18:35.532 position:50% align:center
Hattori! Cover Miyafuji
and fall back!

00:18:35.615 --> 00:18:36.408 position:50% align:center
Roger!

00:18:36.491 --> 00:18:37.992 position:50% align:center
I'm so sorry.

00:18:39.411 --> 00:18:42.080 position:50% align:center
There you are,
Shir--Lucchini?!

00:18:42.163 --> 00:18:43.957 position:50% align:center
Hey! What are you doing
with Shirley's Unit?

00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:45.792 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna beat the enemy myself!

00:18:45.875 --> 00:18:47.252 position:50% align:center
You what?

00:18:47.335 --> 00:18:49.838 position:50% align:center
Shirley's dream won't get
ruined by some dumb Neuroi!

00:18:49.921 --> 00:18:51.423 position:50% align:center
Wait! Fall back!

00:18:53.758 --> 00:18:56.553 position:50% align:center
[FRANCESCA]
Take this!

00:18:58.138 --> 00:18:59.389 position:50% align:center
I missed!

00:18:59.472 --> 00:19:01.683 position:50% align:center
This Unit's really
hard to pilot!

00:19:04.102 --> 00:19:06.604 position:50% align:center
[FRANCESCA grunting]

00:19:06.688 --> 00:19:08.940 position:50% align:center
[screams]

00:19:09.024 --> 00:19:10.692 position:50% align:center
Lucchini!

00:19:23.496 --> 00:19:25.498 position:50% align:center
Francesca!

00:19:25.582 --> 00:19:26.666 position:50% align:center
Shirley?

00:19:26.750 --> 00:19:28.084 position:50% align:center
[SHIRLEY]
Faster, Rapid!

00:19:28.168 --> 00:19:30.170 position:50% align:center
I know that you got it in you!

00:19:37.927 --> 00:19:41.639 position:50% align:center
[SHIRLEY]
Let's go!

00:19:51.191 --> 00:19:52.108 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:19:52.192 --> 00:19:53.943 position:50% align:center
Shirley!

00:19:55.278 --> 00:19:56.738 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:19:56.821 --> 00:19:59.074 position:50% align:center
Thanks, Barkhorn! I owe ya!

00:19:59.157 --> 00:20:00.408 position:50% align:center
You okay?

00:20:00.492 --> 00:20:02.619 position:50% align:center
[FRANCESCA]
Mm-hm.

00:20:02.702 --> 00:20:04.371 position:50% align:center
What a relief.

00:20:04.454 --> 00:20:07.791 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry. I messed
up things again.

00:20:07.874 --> 00:20:11.336 position:50% align:center
You were almost hurt.
It's me who should apologize.

00:20:11.419 --> 00:20:12.504 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry.

00:20:12.587 --> 00:20:14.964 position:50% align:center
Shirley, but what
about the new record?

00:20:15.048 --> 00:20:16.800 position:50% align:center
And your poor Rapid?

00:20:16.883 --> 00:20:20.637 position:50% align:center
Don't worry! Really, it's fine!
You're more important.

00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:22.806 position:50% align:center
I'll get bikes and
records another day!

00:20:22.889 --> 00:20:24.307 position:50% align:center
Shirley!

00:20:30.146 --> 00:20:31.272 position:50% align:center
Where's the Neuroi?

00:20:34.484 --> 00:20:36.695 position:50% align:center
Dammit! The bastard's
trying to get away again!

00:20:36.778 --> 00:20:38.530 position:50% align:center
It's too fast for us to catch.

00:20:38.613 --> 00:20:41.366 position:50% align:center
Hang on. We're not done yet!

00:20:49.457 --> 00:20:50.500 position:50% align:center
She's cruisin'!

00:20:50.583 --> 00:20:52.711 position:50% align:center
Jet Units can't
accelerate like that.

00:20:52.794 --> 00:20:54.879 position:50% align:center
That's the power of the P51H.

00:20:54.963 --> 00:20:57.340 position:50% align:center
No, that's just Shirley's
natural talent!

00:21:02.262 --> 00:21:03.513 position:50% align:center
Hey!

00:21:10.437 --> 00:21:12.480 position:50% align:center
This one's for Francesca!

00:21:21.698 --> 00:21:22.490 position:50% align:center
Wow!

00:21:22.574 --> 00:21:23.867 position:50% align:center
Well done.

00:21:30.498 --> 00:21:35.503 position:50% align:center
[motor humming]

00:21:39.799 --> 00:21:44.262 position:50% align:center

[BOTH laughing]

00:23:35.498 --> 00:23:37.292 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIKA]
How pretty!

00:23:37.375 --> 00:23:39.461 position:50% align:center
[PERRINE] The flowers in
Nederland are in full bloom!

00:23:39.544 --> 00:23:41.588 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKA] Flowers actually
bloom this time of year?

00:23:41.671 --> 00:23:42.756 position:50% align:center
[PERRINE]
Hattori.

00:23:42.839 --> 00:23:45.008 position:50% align:center
Any educated person
knows about flowers.

00:23:45.091 --> 00:23:48.011 position:50% align:center
On the next <i>Strike Witches</i> :
"Queen of Nederland."

00:23:48.094 --> 00:23:50.013 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKA]
Well, I-I do know about tulips.
