00:00:11.886 --> 00:00:13.430 position:50% align:center
[EILA] Barkhorn and her unit
were able to defeat

00:00:13.513 --> 00:00:15.598 position:50% align:center
the Neuroi sighted
around the Hamburg area,

00:00:15.682 --> 00:00:18.184 position:50% align:center
so the route to Kiel
should be clear.

00:00:18.268 --> 00:00:19.644 position:50% align:center
The Western Theatre Forces' aim

00:00:19.728 --> 00:00:21.521 position:50% align:center
to take back that
location, right?

00:00:21.604 --> 00:00:23.523 position:50% align:center
Think they'll begin right away?

00:00:23.606 --> 00:00:25.859 position:50% align:center
We'll have the Saturnus
Festival in Berlin

00:00:25.942 --> 00:00:27.193 position:50% align:center
if this keeps up.

00:00:27.277 --> 00:00:28.903 position:50% align:center
You're going to jinx it
if you start thinking

00:00:28.987 --> 00:00:30.780 position:50% align:center
that far ahead. You know?

00:00:30.864 --> 00:00:32.490 position:50% align:center
[EILA]
I get it. I get it.

00:00:32.574 --> 00:00:35.201 position:50% align:center
We need to win back
Kiel first, right?

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:39.164 position:50% align:center
Visibility's low.

00:00:39.247 --> 00:00:40.623 position:50% align:center
Fog's thick.

00:00:43.043 --> 00:00:44.294 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Eila!

00:00:44.377 --> 00:00:45.879 position:50% align:center
[gasps] A Neuroi?

00:00:45.962 --> 00:00:47.756 position:50% align:center
[SANYA]
At 12 o' clock!

00:00:50.884 --> 00:00:52.344 position:50% align:center
[SANYA, EILA gasps]

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:55.680 position:50% align:center
That's the target?

00:00:57.515 --> 00:00:59.351 position:50% align:center
[SANYA]
It's on the move! Let's go.

00:00:59.434 --> 00:01:00.977 position:50% align:center
[gasps] No!

00:01:01.061 --> 00:01:01.895 position:50% align:center
[BOTH grunt]

00:01:01.978 --> 00:01:04.814 position:50% align:center
[BOTH yell]

00:01:04.898 --> 00:01:06.316 position:50% align:center
What a jerk!

00:01:07.317 --> 00:01:09.736 position:50% align:center
Damn it! I can't see
anything like this.

00:01:09.819 --> 00:01:10.862 position:50% align:center
Where'd it go?

00:01:10.945 --> 00:01:12.614 position:50% align:center
[SANYA]
It's not in detection range.

00:01:12.697 --> 00:01:14.532 position:50% align:center
It seems to have fled.

00:01:14.616 --> 00:01:18.578 position:50% align:center
But how though?
Is the fog from that Neuroi?

00:01:18.661 --> 00:01:20.288 position:50% align:center
I'd assume so.

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:58.011 position:50% align:center
[MINNA] A Neuroi was
spotted near Kiel, too?

00:02:58.094 --> 00:02:59.846 position:50% align:center
[SANYA] Yes. They seem
to have the ability

00:02:59.929 --> 00:03:01.389 position:50% align:center
to create thick fog.

00:03:01.473 --> 00:03:05.643 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry, it escaped
before we could react.

00:03:05.727 --> 00:03:10.148 position:50% align:center
I shouldn't have assumed
we'd reclaim Kiel so easily.

00:03:10.231 --> 00:03:13.276 position:50% align:center
Understood. I'll inform
Command immediately.

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.362 position:50% align:center
Thank you.

00:03:15.445 --> 00:03:16.946 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIKA panting]

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:18.656 position:50% align:center
Miyafuji?

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:20.533 position:50% align:center
A letter came in for Eila?

00:03:20.617 --> 00:03:23.244 position:50% align:center
Yes. But I can't seem
to find her anywhere.

00:03:25.288 --> 00:03:27.540 position:50% align:center
No prob! Lemme help you look.

00:03:27.624 --> 00:03:29.542 position:50% align:center
I'd appreciate that!

00:03:29.626 --> 00:03:30.835 position:50% align:center
By the way,

00:03:30.919 --> 00:03:33.546 position:50% align:center
I don't remember this
tree being here before.

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:36.424 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKA] Oh, that's for
the Saturnus Festival.

00:03:36.508 --> 00:03:38.301 position:50% align:center
Saturnus Festival. Huh.

00:03:38.385 --> 00:03:40.762 position:50% align:center
Is that the one where
they celebrate the winter?

00:03:40.845 --> 00:03:42.138 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKA]
Close enough.

00:03:42.222 --> 00:03:44.349 position:50% align:center
It's a long-standing
tradition to decorate a tree

00:03:44.432 --> 00:03:46.309 position:50% align:center
from top to bottom with
ornaments to celebrate

00:03:46.393 --> 00:03:47.977 position:50% align:center
the oncoming new year.

00:03:48.061 --> 00:03:50.647 position:50% align:center
Ah.

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:53.525 position:50% align:center
Oh, Sanya!

00:03:53.608 --> 00:03:55.026 position:50% align:center
Sanya!

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:56.194 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:03:56.277 --> 00:03:58.530 position:50% align:center
We're looking for Eila,
have you seen her?

00:03:58.613 --> 00:04:01.616 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKA] We can't seem
to find her anywhere!

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:02.992 position:50% align:center
Eila?

00:04:04.828 --> 00:04:06.788 position:50% align:center
There. Perhaps?

00:04:07.997 --> 00:04:09.124 position:50% align:center
[SANYA]
Try in here.

00:04:09.207 --> 00:04:10.125 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:04:10.208 --> 00:04:11.501 position:50% align:center
She's in Flight
Lieutenant Yeager

00:04:11.584 --> 00:04:14.045 position:50% align:center
and Ensign Lucchini's room?

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:15.005 position:50% align:center
[knocking]

00:04:15.088 --> 00:04:17.424 position:50% align:center
Ah! It's open!

00:04:17.507 --> 00:04:18.925 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKA]
Excuse us.

00:04:20.468 --> 00:04:21.302 position:50% align:center
[SANYA]
Hello.

00:04:21.386 --> 00:04:22.804 position:50% align:center
Oh, Sanya!

00:04:22.887 --> 00:04:23.722 position:50% align:center
She's right.

00:04:23.805 --> 00:04:25.640 position:50% align:center
Did you know she
was here, Sanya?

00:04:25.724 --> 00:04:28.018 position:50% align:center
Kinda. I had a hunch.

00:04:28.101 --> 00:04:29.644 position:50% align:center
Mail call for
Officer Juutilainen.

00:04:29.728 --> 00:04:32.522 position:50% align:center
Huh? It says it's from Nipa!

00:04:32.605 --> 00:04:34.733 position:50% align:center
What's that thing you're
messin' with, Eila?

00:04:34.816 --> 00:04:36.818 position:50% align:center
He, he! Check it out.

00:04:36.901 --> 00:04:38.361 position:50% align:center
It's called a <i>himmeli</i> .

00:04:38.445 --> 00:04:40.405 position:50% align:center
It's a good-luck
charm in Suomus.

00:04:40.488 --> 00:04:43.158 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIKA gasps]
That's a cool shape!

00:04:43.241 --> 00:04:44.951 position:50% align:center
The Saturnus Festival is soon.

00:04:45.035 --> 00:04:48.204 position:50% align:center
I'm making it to help decorate.
I wanna fill the tree!

00:04:48.288 --> 00:04:49.581 position:50% align:center
Uh-huh! And we've got the tools

00:04:49.664 --> 00:04:52.542 position:50% align:center
she needs to make 'em,
so she's hangin' out.

00:04:52.625 --> 00:04:55.045 position:50% align:center
Whatcha' think, Sanya?

00:04:55.128 --> 00:04:56.921 position:50% align:center
Oh. Very cute.

00:04:57.005 --> 00:04:58.465 position:50% align:center
[buzzing]

00:04:58.548 --> 00:05:00.759 position:50% align:center
[MINNA] Attention! There
is an emergency meeting.

00:05:00.842 --> 00:05:03.136 position:50% align:center
Everyone to the briefing
room, immediately.

00:05:03.219 --> 00:05:06.056 position:50% align:center
Aw! But I still
have more to make!

00:05:07.349 --> 00:05:09.476 position:50% align:center
[MINNA] As you are aware,
the Western Theater Forces

00:05:09.559 --> 00:05:12.812 position:50% align:center
have devised a plan to
take back the Kiel Port.

00:05:12.896 --> 00:05:15.231 position:50% align:center
So, if I heard right, there's
some cannon-type Neuroi,

00:05:15.315 --> 00:05:17.734 position:50% align:center
and they're doing a pinpoint
air strike on the area?

00:05:17.817 --> 00:05:21.321 position:50% align:center
That was the intent, but look
at this recon surveillance.

00:05:21.404 --> 00:05:23.615 position:50% align:center
[FRANCESCA] I'm looking,
but I'm not seeing anything.

00:05:23.698 --> 00:05:25.325 position:50% align:center
This is a view of Kiel.

00:05:25.408 --> 00:05:26.951 position:50% align:center
It's covered in a fog
that makes seeing

00:05:27.035 --> 00:05:29.537 position:50% align:center
even five meters
ahead impossible.

00:05:29.621 --> 00:05:30.830 position:50% align:center
That's the Neuroi?

00:05:30.914 --> 00:05:32.999 position:50% align:center
It's the same one
we encountered, right?

00:05:33.083 --> 00:05:36.127 position:50% align:center
[MINNA] Correct. A pinpoint
attack won't be effective.

00:05:36.211 --> 00:05:38.004 position:50% align:center
Has the mission
been called off?

00:05:38.088 --> 00:05:40.423 position:50% align:center
Not yet. The brass
still wants Kiel back,

00:05:40.507 --> 00:05:43.885 position:50% align:center
no matter the cost, to ramp us
up for the assault on Berlin.

00:05:43.968 --> 00:05:46.012 position:50% align:center
Therefore, their new
plan is to launch

00:05:46.096 --> 00:05:48.264 position:50% align:center
a saturation strike
in two days' time.

00:05:48.348 --> 00:05:49.891 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIKA]
We can't hold off?

00:05:49.974 --> 00:05:51.976 position:50% align:center
[PERRINE]
Isn't that extreme?

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:55.021 position:50% align:center
It will do serious damage
to Kiel's port facilities.

00:05:55.105 --> 00:05:58.149 position:50% align:center
[BARKHORN] Wait! What happened
to Operation Southwind?

00:05:58.233 --> 00:06:00.026 position:50% align:center
What about Berlin?

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:02.362 position:50% align:center
We'll have to wait for
the port to be rebuilt.

00:06:02.445 --> 00:06:03.738 position:50% align:center
This is ridiculous!

00:06:03.822 --> 00:06:04.989 position:50% align:center
Let's calm down there, Trude.

00:06:05.073 --> 00:06:07.242 position:50% align:center
Don't you have any
problems with this, huh?

00:06:07.325 --> 00:06:08.660 position:50% align:center
I didn't say I liked it!

00:06:08.743 --> 00:06:10.870 position:50% align:center
These orders came straight
from the top brass.

00:06:10.954 --> 00:06:13.123 position:50% align:center
[BARKHORN growls]

00:06:13.206 --> 00:06:15.375 position:50% align:center
Moving on! Captain Barkhorn.

00:06:15.458 --> 00:06:17.585 position:50% align:center
Flight Lieutenant Yeager,
Lieutenants Hartmann

00:06:17.669 --> 00:06:20.005 position:50% align:center
and Clostermann,
Ensign Lucchini,

00:06:20.088 --> 00:06:21.673 position:50% align:center
and Master Sergeant Lynette.

00:06:21.756 --> 00:06:24.759 position:50% align:center
You will all be joining
the bombers as an escort.

00:06:24.843 --> 00:06:26.428 position:50% align:center
Prepare yourselves for battle.

00:06:26.511 --> 00:06:29.222 position:50% align:center
You'll leave for our
Britannia airport at 1400.

00:06:29.305 --> 00:06:31.516 position:50% align:center
Then you'll be on stand-by
until further notice.

00:06:31.599 --> 00:06:32.851 position:50% align:center
[WITCHES]
Roger!

00:06:36.146 --> 00:06:39.065 position:50% align:center
[BARKHORN grunts] Is this really
how you want this to go, Minna?

00:06:39.149 --> 00:06:41.568 position:50% align:center
[MINNA] Of course not.
But it's the army's decision.

00:06:41.651 --> 00:06:43.778 position:50% align:center
It's not like we get
a say in the matter.

00:06:43.862 --> 00:06:45.530 position:50% align:center
There's no point
if we take back Kiel,

00:06:45.613 --> 00:06:48.074 position:50% align:center
but damage the port
in the process.

00:06:48.158 --> 00:06:50.326 position:50% align:center
Then the operation
will be postponed.

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:51.953 position:50% align:center
Most likely past the spring.

00:06:52.037 --> 00:06:54.748 position:50% align:center
By the time that happens,
you and I will both be 20!

00:06:54.831 --> 00:06:56.458 position:50% align:center
The limit of our magic power
could come at any--

00:06:56.541 --> 00:06:58.793 position:50% align:center
[MINNA] Do you not think
I realize that?

00:06:58.877 --> 00:07:01.129 position:50% align:center
You don't know how badly
I'd like to take Berlin back

00:07:01.212 --> 00:07:02.589 position:50% align:center
with my own two hands.

00:07:02.672 --> 00:07:06.259 position:50% align:center
But an order is an order!
There's no challenging it.

00:07:07.802 --> 00:07:10.096 position:50% align:center
[BARKHORN]
I'm sorry. You're right.

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:12.474 position:50% align:center
[MINNA]
If only we had more time.

00:07:15.226 --> 00:07:17.645 position:50% align:center
[BARKHORN] I hope the god
of Saturnus takes mercy on us

00:07:17.729 --> 00:07:20.023 position:50% align:center
and grants us exactly that.

00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:27.781 position:50% align:center
[door opens]

00:07:27.864 --> 00:07:29.366 position:50% align:center
[EILA]
Oh, Sanya!

00:07:29.449 --> 00:07:30.950 position:50% align:center
What d'you think?

00:07:32.952 --> 00:07:36.456 position:50% align:center
[rustling]

00:07:36.539 --> 00:07:38.333 position:50% align:center
Are you okay?

00:07:44.923 --> 00:07:47.217 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKA] All we can do is wait
and hope for the best.

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:48.802 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIKA]
Yeah.

00:07:48.885 --> 00:07:50.178 position:50% align:center
[SANYA]
Do you have a second?

00:07:50.261 --> 00:07:51.680 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:07:52.972 --> 00:07:54.474 position:50% align:center
[MINNA] You still wanna
fight in the fog?

00:07:54.557 --> 00:07:56.101 position:50% align:center
To defeat that Neuroi?

00:07:56.184 --> 00:07:58.478 position:50% align:center
Correct. Eila and I
encountered it

00:07:58.561 --> 00:08:02.399 position:50% align:center
approximately here.
And Kiel is over here.

00:08:02.482 --> 00:08:05.819 position:50% align:center
We should consider
the radius of the fog.

00:08:05.902 --> 00:08:07.779 position:50% align:center
[MINNA] Which would place
the Neuroi somewhere within

00:08:07.862 --> 00:08:09.989 position:50% align:center
20 kilometers of the city, huh?

00:08:10.073 --> 00:08:11.908 position:50% align:center
Precisely. Now, consider.

00:08:11.991 --> 00:08:13.702 position:50% align:center
If we can get close enough
for me to use my

00:08:13.785 --> 00:08:17.122 position:50% align:center
wide-area detection, then we
can track down its location.

00:08:17.205 --> 00:08:19.332 position:50% align:center
I'd say that this
is worth a shot!

00:08:19.416 --> 00:08:21.126 position:50% align:center
Hold on. You said
the fog was so thick,

00:08:21.209 --> 00:08:23.003 position:50% align:center
you couldn't even
see each other.

00:08:23.086 --> 00:08:26.423 position:50% align:center
Please don't worry.
We'll start training right now.

00:08:28.258 --> 00:08:29.759 position:50% align:center
[SANYA]
We won't have much visibility

00:08:29.843 --> 00:08:31.761 position:50% align:center
once we're in the heart of it.

00:08:31.845 --> 00:08:34.264 position:50% align:center
As such, we'll be running
this practice drill.

00:08:34.347 --> 00:08:36.099 position:50% align:center
Keep maintaining
arrowhead formation.

00:08:36.182 --> 00:08:38.935 position:50% align:center
Observe the sounds and magic
power of those around you.

00:08:39.019 --> 00:08:40.437 position:50% align:center
Shizuka, you there?

00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:42.814 position:50% align:center
Uh! Yes! I'm still here!

00:08:42.897 --> 00:08:44.566 position:50% align:center
[SANYA]
Okay, turn to 2 o'clock!

00:08:44.649 --> 00:08:45.984 position:50% align:center
Roger! 2 o' clock!

00:08:46.067 --> 00:08:47.444 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIKA yelps]

00:08:47.527 --> 00:08:49.988 position:50% align:center
Uh! Hold it together, you two!

00:08:50.071 --> 00:08:53.116 position:50% align:center
I can tell Sanya's location
down to the millimeter.

00:08:53.199 --> 00:08:53.950 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKA]
Sorry!

00:08:54.034 --> 00:08:56.119 position:50% align:center
This is so embarrassing!

00:08:56.202 --> 00:08:57.954 position:50% align:center
Let's try it again.

00:08:58.955 --> 00:09:00.290 position:50% align:center
[SANYA]
You're a little too close.

00:09:00.373 --> 00:09:02.834 position:50% align:center
Separate by 0.8 from each other.

00:09:02.917 --> 00:09:04.294 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIKA]
O-Okay.

00:09:05.712 --> 00:09:07.047 position:50% align:center
[SANYA]
Now get closer.

00:09:07.130 --> 00:09:08.840 position:50% align:center
By 0.2 this time.

00:09:08.923 --> 00:09:10.300 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKA]
Okay!

00:09:10.383 --> 00:09:14.137 position:50% align:center
[BOTH grunt, scream]

00:09:16.222 --> 00:09:18.350 position:50% align:center
[SANYA]
Target at 11 o'clock!

00:09:18.433 --> 00:09:22.145 position:50% align:center
3, 2, 1! Fire!

00:09:26.274 --> 00:09:28.318 position:50% align:center
Was Eila the only
one who hit it?

00:09:28.401 --> 00:09:30.653 position:50% align:center
You're amazing,
Officer Juutilainen.

00:09:30.737 --> 00:09:33.031 position:50% align:center
Sanya's detection
magic is perfect.

00:09:33.114 --> 00:09:35.408 position:50% align:center
If you do what she says,
then you'll never miss.

00:09:35.492 --> 00:09:36.618 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIKA]
Huh?

00:09:36.701 --> 00:09:39.037 position:50% align:center
Isn't that right,
Sanya? Tell 'em!

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:41.498 position:50% align:center
Uh-huh. I feel confident.

00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:47.253 position:50% align:center
We've practiced the formation.
We'll make it work!

00:09:47.337 --> 00:09:49.381 position:50% align:center
You're sure you're
not too tired?

00:09:49.464 --> 00:09:51.299 position:50% align:center
Don't do anything reckless.

00:09:51.383 --> 00:09:53.468 position:50% align:center
Right. We'll be fine.

00:09:57.347 --> 00:09:59.307 position:50% align:center
Miyafuji, how's your magic?

00:09:59.391 --> 00:10:01.851 position:50% align:center
I still have plenty left,
so I'm good to go!

00:10:02.852 --> 00:10:06.690 position:50% align:center
[SANYA] You're entering the fog,
be sure to stay in formation.

00:10:08.983 --> 00:10:12.195 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIKA gasps]
I really can't see a thing!

00:10:14.155 --> 00:10:16.533 position:50% align:center
We're going deeper.
Aim for 1 o'clock.

00:10:16.616 --> 00:10:17.867 position:50% align:center
[WITCHES]
Roger!

00:10:27.877 --> 00:10:28.962 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:10:29.045 --> 00:10:30.797 position:50% align:center
[EILA]
How are you holding up, Sanya?

00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:33.508 position:50% align:center
All right. Don't worry.

00:10:33.591 --> 00:10:35.343 position:50% align:center
12 o' clock. Distance 2,000!

00:10:35.427 --> 00:10:36.428 position:50% align:center
Signal detected!

00:10:36.511 --> 00:10:37.512 position:50% align:center
A Neuroi?

00:10:37.595 --> 00:10:39.389 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKA]
Wow! I can't see a thing!

00:10:39.472 --> 00:10:40.682 position:50% align:center
[EILA]
Way to go, Sanya!

00:10:40.765 --> 00:10:42.726 position:50% align:center
Let's move in
a little closer now.

00:10:42.809 --> 00:10:45.562 position:50% align:center
Proceed quietly, though,
and don't shoot yet!

00:10:45.645 --> 00:10:46.896 position:50% align:center
[WITCHES]
Roger!

00:10:48.314 --> 00:10:49.941 position:50% align:center
[SANYA]
One thousand left.

00:10:51.568 --> 00:10:52.986 position:50% align:center
About 500!

00:10:56.906 --> 00:10:57.949 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:11:00.076 --> 00:11:03.163 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Be careful, Sanya!

00:11:03.246 --> 00:11:05.457 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Eila?

00:11:05.540 --> 00:11:06.666 position:50% align:center
[EILA]
Huh?

00:11:06.750 --> 00:11:07.959 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKA]
Officer Juutilainen!

00:11:08.043 --> 00:11:09.919 position:50% align:center
Eila, what're you doing?

00:11:15.258 --> 00:11:16.926 position:50% align:center
We fell out of formation!

00:11:17.010 --> 00:11:18.803 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKA]
What're our orders, Litvyak?

00:11:18.887 --> 00:11:19.888 position:50% align:center
Hold your fire!

00:11:19.971 --> 00:11:22.432 position:50% align:center
You'll hit your allies!
Fall back, now!

00:11:22.515 --> 00:11:23.641 position:50% align:center
[WITCHES]
Roger!

00:11:25.226 --> 00:11:27.729 position:50% align:center
[EILA sighs]
That was close.

00:11:27.812 --> 00:11:30.065 position:50% align:center
Invisible enemies
are pretty rough, huh?

00:11:30.148 --> 00:11:31.191 position:50% align:center
[SANYA]
Eila!

00:11:31.274 --> 00:11:32.650 position:50% align:center
What were you thinking?

00:11:32.734 --> 00:11:34.986 position:50% align:center
You ran ahead blindly,
without my permission!

00:11:35.070 --> 00:11:36.488 position:50% align:center
You're the reason we failed!

00:11:36.571 --> 00:11:37.906 position:50% align:center
Wait a second!

00:11:37.989 --> 00:11:39.908 position:50% align:center
If I didn't react quickly,
you would have been shot!

00:11:39.991 --> 00:11:41.785 position:50% align:center
<i>I</i> would have been shot? By what?

00:11:41.868 --> 00:11:44.412 position:50% align:center
The Neuroi, clearly!
It was over there!

00:11:44.496 --> 00:11:45.872 position:50% align:center
[SANYA]
You saw it?

00:11:45.955 --> 00:11:47.832 position:50% align:center
I didn't need to
see it! I felt it!

00:11:47.916 --> 00:11:50.585 position:50% align:center
And I didn't feel anything!
You were reckless!

00:11:50.669 --> 00:11:52.295 position:50% align:center
The Neuroi wasn't around us!

00:11:52.379 --> 00:11:54.798 position:50% align:center
[EILA]
No! I'm sure it was there!

00:11:56.716 --> 00:11:59.219 position:50% align:center
You really don't
believe me, do you, Eila?

00:11:59.302 --> 00:12:02.472 position:50% align:center
That's funny, I was about
to say the same thing to you!

00:12:12.065 --> 00:12:14.317 position:50% align:center
Honestly! What's her deal?

00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:18.154 position:50% align:center
[SANYA]
We failed. My apologies.

00:12:18.238 --> 00:12:20.490 position:50% align:center
Don't worry. You
did all you could.

00:12:20.573 --> 00:12:21.449 position:50% align:center
We're grateful.

00:12:21.533 --> 00:12:23.702 position:50% align:center
Now, get some rest.

00:12:23.785 --> 00:12:25.537 position:50% align:center
[SANYA]
But the Neuroi.

00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:26.538 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:12:26.621 --> 00:12:29.082 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Not yet. I'm not done.

00:12:29.165 --> 00:12:30.542 position:50% align:center
Please let me try again.

00:12:30.625 --> 00:12:32.961 position:50% align:center
There's still a little time
before tomorrow morning!

00:12:33.044 --> 00:12:36.381 position:50% align:center
Denied. It's too dangerous
with the saturation strike.

00:12:36.464 --> 00:12:38.591 position:50% align:center
[SANYA] I promise we'll
make it work this time.

00:12:38.675 --> 00:12:40.510 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:12:40.593 --> 00:12:44.055 position:50% align:center
I have an idea to
increase our chances.

00:12:55.692 --> 00:12:56.443 position:50% align:center
You were saying?

00:12:56.526 --> 00:12:58.319 position:50% align:center
Right! Uh. Ahem.

00:12:58.403 --> 00:13:01.114 position:50% align:center
Back there, as you know,
things got a little weird

00:13:01.197 --> 00:13:02.574 position:50% align:center
between Sanya and me.

00:13:02.657 --> 00:13:04.576 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry. I guess.

00:13:04.659 --> 00:13:07.662 position:50% align:center
So what? You got in a fight.
Just make up with her already.

00:13:07.746 --> 00:13:09.622 position:50% align:center
I wish it were that
easy, you doofus!

00:13:09.706 --> 00:13:11.041 position:50% align:center
It's embarrassing!

00:13:11.124 --> 00:13:12.709 position:50% align:center
This whole situation
could have been avoided

00:13:12.792 --> 00:13:15.295 position:50% align:center
if you didn't feel the need
to go against her orders!

00:13:15.378 --> 00:13:17.505 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:13:17.589 --> 00:13:18.340 position:50% align:center
Why you!

00:13:18.423 --> 00:13:20.216 position:50% align:center
[yelps]

00:13:20.300 --> 00:13:22.260 position:50% align:center
Huh. Above average!

00:13:23.845 --> 00:13:25.472 position:50% align:center
Wow, not bad.

00:13:25.555 --> 00:13:27.223 position:50% align:center
I know what I sensed back there.

00:13:27.307 --> 00:13:29.184 position:50% align:center
There was something
lurking around.

00:13:29.267 --> 00:13:32.312 position:50% align:center
Yeah, but still.
You can't challenge orders!

00:13:32.395 --> 00:13:34.230 position:50% align:center
Huh. I guess that
means you all think

00:13:34.314 --> 00:13:35.732 position:50% align:center
I'm full of it then, don't you?

00:13:35.815 --> 00:13:37.442 position:50% align:center
Well, I believe you, Eila!

00:13:37.525 --> 00:13:40.111 position:50% align:center
Your intuition is
almost always spot on!

00:13:40.195 --> 00:13:41.571 position:50% align:center
Thanks, Miyafuji.

00:13:41.654 --> 00:13:42.781 position:50% align:center
D'aww!

[YOSHIKA yelps]

00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:48.244 position:50% align:center
Taking a hot bath didn't
make me feel any better.

00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:55.960 position:50% align:center
That's right, the <i>himmeli</i> !

00:14:02.967 --> 00:14:04.594 position:50% align:center

Uh, are you going up again?

00:14:15.063 --> 00:14:15.814 position:50% align:center
[SANYA]
Yes.

00:14:15.897 --> 00:14:17.899 position:50% align:center
Then I'm coming, too.

00:14:17.982 --> 00:14:19.818 position:50% align:center
[SANYA]
Eila.

00:14:19.901 --> 00:14:21.403 position:50% align:center
You're not on this mission.

00:14:21.486 --> 00:14:23.446 position:50% align:center
Uh-- Why not?

00:14:23.530 --> 00:14:25.740 position:50% align:center
[SANYA] We can't afford
any uncertainty.

00:14:25.824 --> 00:14:27.909 position:50% align:center
[EILA gasps]
What's that even mean?

00:14:27.992 --> 00:14:29.994 position:50% align:center
[SANYA]
We're running out of time.

00:14:30.078 --> 00:14:33.248 position:50% align:center
We'll finish this without you.

00:14:33.331 --> 00:14:35.375 position:50% align:center
But, Sanya...

00:14:35.458 --> 00:14:36.793 position:50% align:center
[SANYA]
I'm sorry.

00:14:41.006 --> 00:14:42.882 position:50% align:center
Wait a sec. Where's Eila?

00:14:42.966 --> 00:14:44.968 position:50% align:center
I decided to take
her off the mission.

00:14:45.051 --> 00:14:47.095 position:50% align:center
[gasps] But why?

00:14:47.178 --> 00:14:49.889 position:50% align:center
She's too unpredictable
and she defied clear orders.

00:14:49.973 --> 00:14:51.224 position:50% align:center
It's her own fault.

00:14:51.307 --> 00:14:52.350 position:50% align:center
Poor Eila.

00:14:52.434 --> 00:14:54.477 position:50% align:center
[SANYA]
Let's go. It's time.

00:14:57.981 --> 00:15:00.442 position:50% align:center
[SANYA]
Maintain Delta formation.

00:15:00.525 --> 00:15:01.568 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKA]
Roger.

00:15:01.651 --> 00:15:02.902 position:50% align:center
Roger that.

00:15:05.697 --> 00:15:07.532 position:50% align:center
[EILA]
For cryin' out loud!

00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:13.204 position:50% align:center
Initiating search. Target at 11.

00:15:15.457 --> 00:15:16.916 position:50% align:center
[EILA]
It's done.

00:15:18.710 --> 00:15:21.212 position:50% align:center
[EILA] I guess I should
go hang it up now.

00:15:24.591 --> 00:15:26.051 position:50% align:center
[MINNA]
Eila?

00:15:26.134 --> 00:15:27.844 position:50% align:center
What are you doing?

00:15:27.927 --> 00:15:30.513 position:50% align:center
Hanging up the <i>himmeli</i> I made.
I was taken off the mission,

00:15:30.597 --> 00:15:33.308 position:50% align:center
so I don't have
anything else to do.

00:15:33.391 --> 00:15:35.101 position:50% align:center
[MINNA] You must be
concerned for them.

00:15:35.185 --> 00:15:36.644 position:50% align:center
It's a difficult enemy.

00:15:36.728 --> 00:15:40.231 position:50% align:center
Sanya's pretty capable,
so I'm not too worried.

00:15:41.858 --> 00:15:43.526 position:50% align:center
Hey, quick question.

00:15:43.610 --> 00:15:46.196 position:50% align:center
Is there a reason we're pressed
for time on this mission?

00:15:46.279 --> 00:15:47.739 position:50% align:center
What?

00:15:47.822 --> 00:15:49.949 position:50% align:center
[EILA] Sanya made it sound like
we had to finish it tonight.

00:15:50.033 --> 00:15:52.535 position:50% align:center
She told you that?

00:15:52.619 --> 00:15:54.746 position:50% align:center
I see.

00:15:54.829 --> 00:15:57.791 position:50% align:center
Sanya lost her homeland, too.

00:15:57.874 --> 00:16:01.252 position:50% align:center
So I'm sure she can relate
to how strongly we feel.

00:16:01.336 --> 00:16:02.629 position:50% align:center
[EILA]
Huh?

00:16:02.712 --> 00:16:05.090 position:50% align:center
[MINNA] The thing is,
we want to take back Berlin

00:16:05.173 --> 00:16:07.050 position:50% align:center
while we're still Witches.

00:16:07.133 --> 00:16:08.635 position:50% align:center
Even though that's
a personal wish,

00:16:08.718 --> 00:16:12.722 position:50% align:center
Sanya is kindhearted enough
to fight for it in our stead.

00:16:12.806 --> 00:16:14.182 position:50% align:center
It's so silly.

00:16:14.265 --> 00:16:17.477 position:50% align:center
I really wish she would have
just outright told me.

00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:18.687 position:50% align:center
I think she wanted you to know,

00:16:18.770 --> 00:16:20.271 position:50% align:center
but just couldn't
find the words.

00:16:20.355 --> 00:16:21.564 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:16:25.276 --> 00:16:26.861 position:50% align:center
Sanya.

00:16:42.252 --> 00:16:43.253 position:50% align:center
--[EILA gasps]
--[SANYA] And I didn't

00:16:43.336 --> 00:16:45.338 position:50% align:center
feel anything!
You were reckless!

00:16:45.422 --> 00:16:47.632 position:50% align:center
The Neuroi wasn't around us!

00:16:47.716 --> 00:16:48.842 position:50% align:center
[EILA]
What if there was an enemy

00:16:48.925 --> 00:16:51.052 position:50% align:center
and her magic
couldn't detect it?

00:16:51.136 --> 00:16:51.928 position:50% align:center
[MINNA]
Something wrong?

00:16:52.012 --> 00:16:53.680 position:50% align:center
Sanya's in danger! I have to go!

00:16:53.763 --> 00:16:55.098 position:50% align:center
Eila, wait!

00:16:56.349 --> 00:16:58.560 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIKA]
We're out pretty far.

00:16:58.643 --> 00:17:01.646 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKA] I'm surprised
we haven't found it yet.

00:17:01.730 --> 00:17:02.772 position:50% align:center
[SANYA]
It's here!

00:17:02.856 --> 00:17:04.107 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:17:04.190 --> 00:17:05.525 position:50% align:center
[SANYA] We'll do a stealth
approach and then launch

00:17:05.608 --> 00:17:08.445 position:50% align:center
an all-out attack
on my command.

00:17:11.740 --> 00:17:12.866 position:50% align:center
Now fire!

00:17:18.163 --> 00:17:19.789 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKA]
That was it! We did it!

00:17:19.873 --> 00:17:20.874 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:17:28.882 --> 00:17:30.258 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIKA]
It's still there!

00:17:30.342 --> 00:17:32.010 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKA]
The heck?

00:17:32.093 --> 00:17:35.388 position:50% align:center
Darn it! This thing's
a drone, you guys!

00:17:37.307 --> 00:17:39.476 position:50% align:center
[ALL grunt]

00:17:41.644 --> 00:17:43.563 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIKA]
No way.

00:17:43.646 --> 00:17:45.774 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKA]
That's a Neuroi controller?

00:17:51.780 --> 00:17:54.449 position:50% align:center
Sorry! I couldn't
detect it at all!

00:17:54.532 --> 00:17:55.367 position:50% align:center
Why?

00:17:55.450 --> 00:17:57.369 position:50% align:center
We can't give up here!

00:17:57.452 --> 00:17:58.203 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIKA yelps]

00:17:58.286 --> 00:17:59.579 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKA]
Miyafuji!

00:17:59.662 --> 00:18:01.373 position:50% align:center
[SANYA]
Did your magic run out?

00:18:01.456 --> 00:18:02.957 position:50% align:center
I-I'm sorry.

00:18:03.041 --> 00:18:04.626 position:50% align:center
[SANYA] It's too dangerous
to try and fight

00:18:04.709 --> 00:18:07.462 position:50% align:center
two Neuroi like this.
We must retreat.

00:18:07.545 --> 00:18:09.005 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIKA, SHIZUKA]
Roger.

00:18:15.637 --> 00:18:16.930 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKA]
It cut us off!

00:18:20.475 --> 00:18:21.726 position:50% align:center
We totally missed it!

00:18:21.810 --> 00:18:23.103 position:50% align:center
This is bad.

00:18:24.270 --> 00:18:26.606 position:50% align:center
[SANYA]
I finally understand now.

00:18:26.690 --> 00:18:29.859 position:50% align:center
My detection waves passed
right through this Neuroi.

00:18:29.943 --> 00:18:33.738 position:50% align:center
I was only identifying
the smaller unit.

00:18:33.822 --> 00:18:37.283 position:50% align:center
This is the one that
Eila must have felt before.

00:18:41.371 --> 00:18:42.706 position:50% align:center
Oh, no!

00:18:49.004 --> 00:18:50.463 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Eila!

00:18:50.547 --> 00:18:52.382 position:50% align:center
Thank you!

00:18:52.465 --> 00:18:54.384 position:50% align:center
Just in time!

00:18:54.467 --> 00:18:55.969 position:50% align:center
Eila. I didn't mean--

00:18:56.052 --> 00:18:59.139 position:50% align:center
We can talk later!
Let's finish the mission.

00:19:00.140 --> 00:19:00.932 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIKA gasps]

00:19:01.016 --> 00:19:01.933 position:50% align:center
[EILA]
You won't get away!

00:19:02.017 --> 00:19:03.309 position:50% align:center
[SANYA]
Wait!

00:19:03.393 --> 00:19:05.478 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIKA] Shizuka, let's
take on the other one!

00:19:05.562 --> 00:19:06.604 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKA]
Roger!

00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:11.901 position:50% align:center
[EILA]
So that's the core?

00:19:11.985 --> 00:19:13.987 position:50% align:center
We need to fight
this one differently.

00:19:14.070 --> 00:19:15.697 position:50% align:center
So, let's see.

00:19:17.741 --> 00:19:19.701 position:50% align:center
Eila, where are you?

00:19:23.038 --> 00:19:24.956 position:50% align:center
There it is!

00:19:25.040 --> 00:19:28.251 position:50% align:center
[EILA yells]

00:19:28.335 --> 00:19:29.377 position:50% align:center
Now I gotcha!

00:19:29.461 --> 00:19:34.716 position:50% align:center
[inhales] Sanya!

00:19:34.799 --> 00:19:36.426 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Eila!

00:19:36.509 --> 00:19:37.677 position:50% align:center
[EILA]
Follow my voice!

00:19:37.761 --> 00:19:38.887 position:50% align:center
Can you tell where I am?

00:19:38.970 --> 00:19:39.763 position:50% align:center
[SANYA]
Yeah.

00:19:39.846 --> 00:19:41.473 position:50% align:center
You have to shoot towards me!

00:19:41.556 --> 00:19:43.391 position:50% align:center
[gasps] I can't do that!

00:19:43.475 --> 00:19:44.601 position:50% align:center
That's way too risky!

00:19:44.684 --> 00:19:46.102 position:50% align:center
Just believe in me!

00:19:46.186 --> 00:19:48.229 position:50% align:center
Now shoot!

00:19:53.735 --> 00:19:55.070 position:50% align:center
It's over!

00:20:02.243 --> 00:20:03.578 position:50% align:center
Eila!

00:20:07.290 --> 00:20:08.166 position:50% align:center
It blew up?

00:20:08.249 --> 00:20:09.250 position:50% align:center
They did it!

00:20:09.334 --> 00:20:11.503 position:50% align:center
They destroyed the
Neuroi controller!

00:20:11.586 --> 00:20:14.130 position:50% align:center
Eila! Eila!

00:20:14.214 --> 00:20:16.132 position:50% align:center
[EILA]
Sanya!

00:20:16.216 --> 00:20:17.342 position:50% align:center

Sanya!

00:20:21.846 --> 00:20:22.639 position:50% align:center
Eila.

00:20:22.722 --> 00:20:25.266 position:50% align:center
[giggles] We make a great team.

00:20:25.350 --> 00:20:26.518 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:20:32.440 --> 00:20:35.276 position:50% align:center
[PERRINE]
We'll be over Kiel any minute.

00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:37.278 position:50% align:center
[LYNNE]
Look, everyone!

00:20:37.362 --> 00:20:38.196 position:50% align:center
[SHIRLEY]
The fog!

00:20:38.279 --> 00:20:39.948 position:50% align:center
[FRANCESCA]
It's easin' up!

00:20:40.031 --> 00:20:41.157 position:50% align:center
[GENERAL 308A]
Change of plans.

00:20:41.241 --> 00:20:42.701 position:50% align:center
We will now launch
a precision strike

00:20:42.784 --> 00:20:44.786 position:50% align:center
on the Neuroi
cannon emplacements.

00:20:44.869 --> 00:20:47.539 position:50% align:center
Witches, continue your escort.

[HARTMANN]
Trude, did you hear that?

00:20:49.124 --> 00:20:51.251 position:50% align:center
[BARKHORN]
Yeah! Sounds good!

00:20:53.294 --> 00:20:54.838 position:50% align:center
[MINNA]
I just received word.

00:20:54.921 --> 00:20:57.048 position:50% align:center
Kiel was recovered unharmed.

00:20:57.132 --> 00:20:57.966 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:20:58.049 --> 00:20:59.509 position:50% align:center
[MINNA]
Thank you, Sanya.

00:21:05.056 --> 00:21:07.475 position:50% align:center
We were able to
reclaim Kiel unharmed!

00:21:07.559 --> 00:21:09.227 position:50% align:center
Couldn't ask for
a better present!

00:21:09.310 --> 00:21:11.855 position:50% align:center
Now we can focus
on taking back Berlin!

00:21:11.938 --> 00:21:13.314 position:50% align:center
Finally.

00:21:13.398 --> 00:21:16.234 position:50% align:center
[EILA] It's another good
Saturnus Festival this year.

00:21:16.317 --> 00:21:17.068 position:50% align:center
[SANYA]
Uh-huh.

00:21:17.152 --> 00:21:19.112 position:50% align:center
Uh, by the way. Sanya.

00:21:19.195 --> 00:21:21.573 position:50% align:center
I made you a little something
to celebrate tonight.

00:21:21.656 --> 00:21:23.491 position:50% align:center
Oh? Like a present?

00:21:23.575 --> 00:21:26.161 position:50% align:center
Uh! On the tree!
See that <i>himmeli</i> there?

00:21:26.244 --> 00:21:28.371 position:50% align:center
[SANYA]
Hm? Which one?

00:21:28.455 --> 00:21:29.497 position:50% align:center
Huh? There's more?

00:21:29.581 --> 00:21:31.332 position:50% align:center
[SANYA giggles]

00:21:31.416 --> 00:21:34.044 position:50% align:center
[YOSHIKA] I made the
star one on the far right.

00:21:34.127 --> 00:21:36.296 position:50% align:center
And I made the one
on the left side.

00:21:36.379 --> 00:21:40.550 position:50% align:center
Uh-- Okay. Where'd the
other one come from then?

00:21:40.633 --> 00:21:42.093 position:50% align:center
That one would be mine.

00:21:42.177 --> 00:21:44.637 position:50% align:center
Like it? I made it just for you.

00:21:44.721 --> 00:21:46.181 position:50% align:center
I hope you'll accept it.

00:21:46.264 --> 00:21:48.641 position:50% align:center
Huh? Sanya!

00:21:50.393 --> 00:21:52.103 position:50% align:center
O-Of course!

00:21:54.856 --> 00:21:58.651 position:50% align:center
All right! I got me
a present from Sanya!

00:21:58.735 --> 00:22:03.156 position:50% align:center
--Hooray! Hooray!
--[WITCHES laughing]

00:23:35.582 --> 00:23:37.500 position:50% align:center
[HARTMANN]
Ugh! This coffee is so bitter!

00:23:37.584 --> 00:23:39.586 position:50% align:center
[URSULA] It's actually made
from dandelion root.

00:23:39.669 --> 00:23:42.047 position:50% align:center
[HARTMANN] Well, That's
stupid--I want real coffee!

00:23:42.130 --> 00:23:44.716 position:50% align:center
[MINNA] When we take back
Berlin, let's go to a café.

00:23:44.799 --> 00:23:46.718 position:50% align:center
[BARKHORN] It's too early
to think about that!

00:23:46.801 --> 00:23:49.929 position:50% align:center
[MINNA] On the next <i>Strike</i>
<i>Witches</i> : "Minna's Sky"!
