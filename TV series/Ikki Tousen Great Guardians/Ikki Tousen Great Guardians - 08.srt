1
00:00:08,333 --> 00:00:10,500
- ( theme music playing )

2
00:00:20,791 --> 00:00:22,958
( singing in Japanese )

3
00:01:44,916 --> 00:01:47,041
- ( water trickling )

4
00:02:03,083 --> 00:02:05,333
- AHH.

5
00:02:09,166 --> 00:02:11,083
THAT WAS A NICE BATH.
AND NOW IT'S TIME 

6
00:02:11,166 --> 00:02:13,041
FOR A GOOD NIGHT'S SLEEP.
- EKITOKU.

7
00:02:13,125 --> 00:02:16,041
MAKE SURE YOU'RE NOT LATE
FOR PRACTICE TOMORROW MORNING.

8
00:02:16,125 --> 00:02:18,916
- CRAP, I FORGOT.  I'D BETTER
HURRY UP AND GET TO SLEEP

9
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,375
BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.
ALL RIGHT, SEE YOU LATER.

10
00:02:21,458 --> 00:02:23,916
- YES, I'LL SEE YOU
TOMORROW MORNING.

11
00:02:26,125 --> 00:02:28,166
- Gentoku: EKITOKU.
- HUH?

12
00:02:30,625 --> 00:02:31,958
WHAT'S UP, GENTOKU?

13
00:02:32,041 --> 00:02:34,375
WHAT, DID YOU HAVE A BAD DREAM
AND WET YOURSELF IN BED?

14
00:02:34,458 --> 00:02:37,666
- ( chuckles ) DON'T BE SILLY.
OF COURSE I DIDN'T.

15
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:39,958
- HUH?  HUH?

16
00:02:40,041 --> 00:02:44,333
- HAS ANYONE TOLD YOU HOW NICE
YOU SMELL AFTER A BATH?

17
00:02:47,166 --> 00:02:49,416
- HEY, GENTOKU,
QUIT FOOLING AROUND ALREADY.

18
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:50,791
IT'S NOT FUNNY.
ARGH!

19
00:02:52,375 --> 00:02:54,416
HANG ON.  WHAT DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE DOING?

20
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,958
I DON'T KNOW WHEN YOU STARTED
GETTING INTO THIS SORT OF THING,

21
00:02:57,041 --> 00:02:59,208
BUT CUT IT OUT.

22
00:03:05,208 --> 00:03:07,291
- ( chuckles )

23
00:03:36,875 --> 00:03:39,250
- Gentoku:
HUH?  EKITOKU'S MISSING?

24
00:03:39,333 --> 00:03:41,541
- RIGHT.  I HAVEN'T SEEN HER
SINCE LAST NIGHT,

25
00:03:41,625 --> 00:03:43,708
WHICH MEANS SHE'S MISSED
BOTH PRACTICE AND CLASSES.

26
00:03:43,791 --> 00:03:46,625
- IT COULD BE NOTHING.
MAYBE SHE HAD AN UPSET STOMACH

27
00:03:46,708 --> 00:03:48,750
AND IS RESTING IN HER ROOM.
- I'VE LOOKED.

28
00:03:48,833 --> 00:03:50,791
BUT WHEN I GOT THERE,
THERE WAS NO SIGN OF HER.

29
00:03:50,875 --> 00:03:54,250
- LEADER, LOOKS LIKE THE BUS
IS GONNA BE HERE REALLY SOON.

30
00:03:54,333 --> 00:03:56,500
- OKAY.
- GENTOKU,

31
00:03:56,583 --> 00:03:58,583
WHERE ARE YOU PLANNING
ON GOING AT THIS HOUR?

32
00:03:58,666 --> 00:04:00,375
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
"AT THIS HOUR"?

33
00:04:00,458 --> 00:04:02,541
IT'S NOT LIKE IT'S LATE.
WE ONLY JUST FINISHED CLASS

34
00:04:02,625 --> 00:04:04,666
FOR THE DAY, SO I THOUGHT
IT'D BE FUN TO GO TO THE CITY

35
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:06,041
WITH SOME FRIENDS.

36
00:04:06,125 --> 00:04:07,875
( giggles )

37
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:12,541
- GENTOKU, AREN'T YOU EVEN
THE LEAST BIT WORRIED

38
00:04:12,625 --> 00:04:15,458
THAT EKITOKU'S GONE MISSING?
- DON'T BE SUCH A WORRYWART.

39
00:04:15,541 --> 00:04:18,166
YOU'RE ACTING LIKE
IT'S THE END OF THE WORLD.

40
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:19,833
- DON'T YOU REALIZE
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE

41
00:04:19,916 --> 00:04:21,333
THE LEADER
OF SEITO ACADEMY?

42
00:04:21,416 --> 00:04:23,208
- YES, YES, OF COURSE
I REALIZE THAT.

43
00:04:23,291 --> 00:04:25,791
KAN'U, YOU NEED TO LEARN
TO STOP WORRYING SO MUCH

44
00:04:25,875 --> 00:04:28,958
ABOUT EVERYONE ELSE, AND TRY TO
HAVE SOME FUN FOR A CHANGE.

45
00:04:29,041 --> 00:04:30,250
READY?

46
00:04:30,333 --> 00:04:32,375
- I CAN'T WAIT.
SAY, YOU HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE

47
00:04:32,458 --> 00:04:33,958
TO CHECK OUT THE NEW SHOP,
RIGHT?

48
00:04:34,041 --> 00:04:36,041
- NO, I HAVEN'T.
WHAT KIND IS IT?

49
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,791
- ( snoring )

50
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:54,291
- MR. KOUCHUU.
MR. KOUCHUU.

51
00:04:54,375 --> 00:04:57,875
- THAT VOICE--
IT SOUNDS LIKE OUR LEADER.

52
00:05:14,958 --> 00:05:16,416
- MM.

53
00:05:18,625 --> 00:05:21,416
YOU DIDN'T EVEN SENSE
MY PRESENCE.

54
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,500
SO STRANGE THINGS
DO HAPPEN.

55
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:25,791
- WHAT IS IT?
IS SOMETHING WRONG?

56
00:05:25,875 --> 00:05:28,916
- HAVE YOU SEEN KOUCHUU?
IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE

57
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,750
HE HAD A CHANCE TO SWEEP UP
THE COURTYARD THIS MORNING.

58
00:05:31,833 --> 00:05:33,291
WHAT'S WRONG?

59
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:35,916
- WELL, ACTUALLY NO ONE'S SEEN
EKITOKU AROUND EITHER.

60
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,291
- EKITOKU TOO?

61
00:05:38,375 --> 00:05:40,583
- AND--
- AND WHAT?

62
00:05:40,666 --> 00:05:43,625
- GENTOKU SEEMS DIFFERENT
SINCE YESTERDAY.

63
00:05:48,458 --> 00:05:51,041
- YOU MUST HAVE FAITH
IN HER.

64
00:05:51,125 --> 00:05:54,083
SUSPICION CAN ONLY
MAKE ONE BLIND.

65
00:05:54,166 --> 00:05:57,291
BUT IF YOU HOLD ONTO FAITH,
YOU CAN BE MADE TO SEE AGAIN.

66
00:05:57,375 --> 00:06:00,333
- YOU ARE GENTOKU RYUUBI'S
SUBORDINATE.

67
00:06:00,416 --> 00:06:02,291
IF YOU CAN'T BELIEVE
IN YOUR OWN LEADER,

68
00:06:02,375 --> 00:06:04,833
WHO ELSE
CAN YOU BELIEVE IN?

69
00:06:06,375 --> 00:06:07,625
- RIGHT.

70
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:17,083
I MUST HAVE FAITH.

71
00:06:18,833 --> 00:06:20,625
- ( laughing )

72
00:06:23,125 --> 00:06:26,208
OH, WHY DON'T YOU JUST FORGET
ABOUT THE READING ASSIGNMENT?

73
00:06:26,291 --> 00:06:28,291
WE SHOULD JUST GO OUT
AND HAVE FUN.

74
00:06:28,375 --> 00:06:30,458
AFTER ALL,
WE'RE ONLY IN HIGH SCHOOL.

75
00:06:30,541 --> 00:06:32,500
SO WE SHOULDN'T BE
WASTING OUR YOUTH.

76
00:06:32,583 --> 00:06:34,833
IF WE KEEP STICKING AROUND
THE MOUNTAINS LIKE THIS,

77
00:06:34,916 --> 00:06:37,958
WE'LL TURN INTO OLD HAGS
BEFORE WE EVEN REALIZE IT.

78
00:06:38,041 --> 00:06:39,833
OKAY THEN, GOOD NIGHT.

79
00:06:42,541 --> 00:06:44,000
OH, LOOK, IT'S YOU.

80
00:06:44,083 --> 00:06:45,500
- G-- GENTOKU,

81
00:06:45,583 --> 00:06:48,041
WHERE DO YOU PLAN ON GOING
SO LATE IN THE EVENING?

82
00:06:48,125 --> 00:06:50,875
- WHAT ABOUT YOU?
JUST WHERE DO YOU PLAN ON GOING

83
00:06:50,958 --> 00:06:52,500
WHEN IT'S SO LATE
IN THE EVENING?

84
00:06:52,583 --> 00:06:55,791
- HUH?  I--
I'M OUT HERE GUARDING YOU.

85
00:06:55,875 --> 00:06:58,083
- YOU HAVE TOO MUCH
FREE TIME.

86
00:06:58,166 --> 00:07:00,500
DON'T YOU THINK
IT'S A BIT STIFLING

87
00:07:00,583 --> 00:07:03,083
HAVING YOU BREATHE DOWN MY NECK
ALL THE TIME?

88
00:07:04,458 --> 00:07:07,125
- EKITOKU AND KOUCHUU HAVE BOTH
DISAPPEARED ALREADY.

89
00:07:07,208 --> 00:07:09,583
WHO KNOWS WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN
TO YOU NEXT?

90
00:07:09,666 --> 00:07:13,041
- DON'T BE SO SILLY, KAN'U.
TAKE A LOOK.

91
00:07:13,125 --> 00:07:15,791
EKITOKU AND MR. KOUCHUU
ARE RIGHT OVER THERE.

92
00:07:18,125 --> 00:07:19,958
- EKITOKU, KOUCHUU,

93
00:07:20,041 --> 00:07:21,833
WHERE HAVE YOU TWO BEEN
ALL THIS TIME?

94
00:07:21,916 --> 00:07:24,708
- KAN'U, YOU SHOULD PROBABLY
STOP BEING SO NEEDY

95
00:07:24,791 --> 00:07:26,875
ALL THE TIME.  IF YOU KEEP
ACTING LIKE A STALKER,

96
00:07:26,958 --> 00:07:28,916
GENTOKU WILL END UP
HATING YOU.

97
00:07:31,083 --> 00:07:32,875
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

98
00:07:32,958 --> 00:07:35,083
- ( laughs )

99
00:07:35,166 --> 00:07:37,000
I'M JUST FOOLING AROUND.

100
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:41,500
- WHAT'S GOING ON?
ARE YOU REALLY GENTOKU?

101
00:07:41,583 --> 00:07:42,625
- ( giggles )

102
00:07:52,541 --> 00:07:53,708
- WAIT!

103
00:07:53,791 --> 00:07:55,958
- DON'T THINK I'LL LET YOU
GET PAST ME.

104
00:07:59,291 --> 00:08:00,541
- WAIT, GENTOKU.

105
00:08:00,625 --> 00:08:02,333
GENTOKU!

106
00:08:12,041 --> 00:08:13,666
- WHAT IS IT, GENTOKU?

107
00:08:15,916 --> 00:08:17,125
- ( chuckles )

108
00:08:28,541 --> 00:08:30,416
- HEY, WHAT'S GOING ON
HERE, LEADER?

109
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,958
- YOU'RE IN MY WAY.
- HUH?

110
00:08:42,791 --> 00:08:45,000
- BASHOKU.
- HUH?

111
00:08:45,083 --> 00:08:47,916
- GO TO NANYO.
- NANYO?  BUT MISS KOUMEI--

112
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,666
- GO.  TELL THEIR LEADER
HAKUFU SONSAKU

113
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:52,541
ABOUT EVERYTHING
THAT'S HAPPENED.

114
00:08:55,541 --> 00:08:56,791
- MISS KOUMEI.

115
00:09:08,625 --> 00:09:10,791
- KAN'U!

116
00:09:10,875 --> 00:09:12,291
JUST TURN AROUND
AND FIGHT.

117
00:09:12,375 --> 00:09:14,666
IT'S NO FUN IF YOU'RE
RUNNING AWAY THE WHOLE TIME.

118
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,125
- SOMETHING'S
DEFINITELY WRONG.

119
00:09:21,208 --> 00:09:24,250
EKITOKU AND KOUCHUU
WOULD NEVER ATTACK ME.

120
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:28,750
I DON'T WANT TO FIGHT,

121
00:09:28,833 --> 00:09:31,375
BUT I CAN'T LET THIS
SENSELESS BATTLE DRAG ON.

122
00:09:36,333 --> 00:09:39,000
- KAN'U, OVER HERE.

123
00:09:46,416 --> 00:09:48,291
- CAN YOU TELL ME WHAT
IN THE WORLD IS HAPPENING

124
00:09:48,375 --> 00:09:50,500
TO SEITO ACADEMY?
- DO YOU REALLY WANT TO KNOW?

125
00:09:50,583 --> 00:09:51,666
- YES.

126
00:09:59,416 --> 00:10:01,750
SHIRYU, NOT YOU TOO.

127
00:10:01,833 --> 00:10:04,416
- OF COURSE
SHE'S WITH US.

128
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:05,916
DON'T FLATTER YOURSELF
INTO THINKING

129
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,875
THAT WE'RE THE ONLY ONES
AT SEITO THAT HATE YOU.

130
00:10:12,791 --> 00:10:15,500
- ( Ryuubi giggles )
EVERYONE'S ON THE SAME PAGE.

131
00:10:18,666 --> 00:10:20,500
- Kan'u: GENTOKU.

132
00:10:20,583 --> 00:10:22,583
- EVERYONE EXCEPT YOU, KAN'U.

133
00:10:43,041 --> 00:10:44,958
- ( clock chiming )

134
00:10:48,458 --> 00:10:49,875
- Hakufu: HUH?
- ( mews )

135
00:10:49,958 --> 00:10:52,083
- YOU'RE TELLING ME
MOU-CHAN IS ABSENT AGAIN?

136
00:10:52,166 --> 00:10:55,125
- YES, AND IT LOOKS LIKE
HER CELLPHONE IS OFF TOO.

137
00:10:55,208 --> 00:10:57,333
- OH, DARN IT.
AND I JUST FOUND

138
00:10:57,416 --> 00:10:59,666
A PART-TIME JOB
THAT'D BE PERFECT FOR HER TOO.

139
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:00,875
- WHAT'S WRONG
WITH HER?

140
00:11:00,958 --> 00:11:02,708
IS MISS RYOMOU
SICK OR SOMETHING?

141
00:11:02,791 --> 00:11:04,208
- HUH?

142
00:11:04,291 --> 00:11:06,083
I'M GONNA CHECK ON HER.

143
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:07,958
- WHAT ABOUT ALL YOUR
AFTERNOON CLASSES?

144
00:11:08,041 --> 00:11:10,166
- I'M FAILING ANYWAY,
SO WHAT'S THE POINT?

145
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:11,333
- HAKUFU.

146
00:11:15,625 --> 00:11:17,875
- HEY, ARE YOU
ALL RIGHT?

147
00:11:17,958 --> 00:11:22,458
- IS-- IS THIS
NANYO ACADEMY?

148
00:11:22,541 --> 00:11:24,208
- YES, IT IS.

149
00:11:24,291 --> 00:11:26,208
- I HAVE A MESSAGE
FOR THE LEADER--

150
00:11:26,291 --> 00:11:29,083
HAKUFU SONSAKU.

151
00:11:29,166 --> 00:11:30,333
- HUH?

152
00:11:33,541 --> 00:11:36,416
- Hakufu: I'M GOING
TO SEITO ACADEMY.

153
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:39,000
- AND I'M COMING WITH YOU.
- I'M COMING TOO.

154
00:11:39,083 --> 00:11:41,916
- NO, KOUKIN, I NEED YOU
TO FIND MOU-CHAN INSTEAD.

155
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,916
WHILE IT'S TRUE I AM
WORRIED ABOUT RYUU-CHAN,

156
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,625
I'M JUST AS CONCERNED
ABOUT MOU-CHAN'S SAFETY.

157
00:11:46,708 --> 00:11:47,875
- HAKUFU.

158
00:11:47,958 --> 00:11:49,458
I UNDERSTAND.

159
00:11:49,541 --> 00:11:52,708
- BIG BROTHER KOUKIN,
PLEASE ALLOW ME TO GO WITH YOU

160
00:11:52,791 --> 00:11:54,416
AND HELP FIND HER.
- RIGHT.

161
00:12:18,291 --> 00:12:20,000
- ARE YOU SHIMEI RYOMOU?

162
00:12:20,083 --> 00:12:21,166
- YES.

163
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:22,875
- THEN I HAVE BEEN
WAITING FOR YOU.

164
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:24,791
PLEASE COME WITH ME.

165
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:31,291
- Koukin: WHAT?
SHE HASN'T COME BACK?

166
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:34,125
- NOPE.  SORRY,
BUT I CAN'T EVEN BEGIN

167
00:12:34,208 --> 00:12:35,833
TO THINK WHERE RYOMOU
COULD HAVE GONE.

168
00:12:35,916 --> 00:12:37,625
- AND ABOUT HOW LONG
HAS SHE BEEN AWAY?

169
00:12:37,708 --> 00:12:40,916
- WELL, I DON'T REALLY
REMEMBER.

170
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:47,125
- ARE YOU OKAY?

171
00:12:47,208 --> 00:12:49,666
- UH, YEAH, I'M FINE, BUT WE
SHOULD PROBABLY GET GOING.

172
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:52,375
- HUH?  HANG ON.
WHAT'S WRONG, CHUBO?

173
00:12:53,791 --> 00:12:55,500
CAN YOU LET US KNOW
WHEN RYOMOU GETS BACK?

174
00:12:55,583 --> 00:12:58,041
- YEAH, SURE THING.

175
00:13:01,541 --> 00:13:03,458
- SO WHAT WAS
THE PROBLEM, CHUBO?

176
00:13:03,541 --> 00:13:05,458
ARE YOU FEELING SICK
OR SOMETHING?

177
00:13:05,541 --> 00:13:08,583
- UH, OH, NO.  SORRY ABOUT THAT.
IT'S NOTHING.

178
00:13:14,041 --> 00:13:15,500
- THAT GIRL...

179
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:19,958
- IT CAN'T BE.

180
00:13:20,041 --> 00:13:22,375
- EVERYTHING OKAY?

181
00:13:22,458 --> 00:13:25,083
SO WERE YOU FINALLY ABLE
TO FIND SHIMEI RYOMOU?

182
00:13:38,291 --> 00:13:41,458
- CHOURYUU HAKKE CHOUSHIKI.
KYUUHOSOUSHU.

183
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,083
WE'LL STOP HERE
FOR NOW.

184
00:13:51,166 --> 00:13:53,416
GO TO THE HOT SPRING NEARBY
AND CLEAN YOURSELF UP.

185
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,583
- MASTER CHOUSHOU,
I CAN KEEP GOING.

186
00:13:55,666 --> 00:13:58,041
- MAYBE, BUT THE DARK CLOUDS
IN YOUR HEART

187
00:13:58,125 --> 00:14:00,916
WILL NOT CLEAR SO EASILY.
RIGHT NOW I'M AFRAID

188
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,583
YOUR SPIRIT IS TOO OVERCOME
WITH DOUBT.

189
00:14:07,875 --> 00:14:11,416
- YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY SURE SHE HAS
NO IDEA WHERE SHE WENT?

190
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:14,375
OKAY, WELL, THEN WHAT ABOUT
FUU-CHIN?

191
00:14:14,458 --> 00:14:17,000
ALL RIGHT, KOUKIN.
I'LL SEE YOU.

192
00:14:17,083 --> 00:14:18,791
- I TAKE IT
SHE WASN'T THERE?

193
00:14:18,875 --> 00:14:20,958
- HUH-UH.
- THOUGHT SO.

194
00:14:22,125 --> 00:14:23,166
- HUH?

195
00:14:27,208 --> 00:14:28,625
WHAT HAPPENED HERE?

196
00:14:28,708 --> 00:14:30,625
- IT LOOKS LIKE
A BATTLE WAS FOUGHT.

197
00:14:30,708 --> 00:14:32,750
- YEAH, BUT WHY
WAS IT FOUGHT?

198
00:14:32,833 --> 00:14:34,833
- HAKUFU SONSAKU.

199
00:14:34,916 --> 00:14:37,291
- Gakushu: UNCHO KAN'U?

200
00:14:37,375 --> 00:14:39,291
- WHY ARE YOU HERE?

201
00:14:39,375 --> 00:14:42,375
- ( Ryuubi chuckles )
LOOKS LIKE WE FOUND YOU, KAN'U.

202
00:14:47,125 --> 00:14:50,166
- WHAT HAPPENED, RYUU-CHAN?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING WAY UP THERE?

203
00:14:52,208 --> 00:14:54,250
- HAKUFU SONSAKU?

204
00:15:07,083 --> 00:15:08,500
- WHAT?

205
00:15:09,833 --> 00:15:11,666
- WELL, LOOK
WHO WE HAVE HERE.

206
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:14,791
IF IT ISN'T THE GORILLA OF NANYO
AND ITS BOOBY-BOMBED LEADER.

207
00:15:14,875 --> 00:15:17,791
- WHAT'S GOING ON?  WHY ARE
ALL OF YOUR CLOTHES TORN UP?

208
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:20,041
- WELL, MAYBE THIS'S WHY.

209
00:15:25,083 --> 00:15:26,500
- SONSAKU.

210
00:15:35,583 --> 00:15:37,500
- SHE DIDN'T EVEN REGRET
ATTACKING HIM.

211
00:15:37,583 --> 00:15:39,666
SO DID THEY JUST HAVE
A FALLING OUT?

212
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:40,875
- THAT ISN'T IT.

213
00:15:45,958 --> 00:15:48,291
- RYUU-CHAN,
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?

214
00:15:48,375 --> 00:15:51,166
WHAT YOU'RE DOING RIGHT NOW
IS NOT LIKE YOU AT ALL.

215
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:53,958
RYUU-CHAN.  RYUU-CHAN.

216
00:15:58,583 --> 00:16:00,416
RYUU-CHAN, RYUU-CHAN.

217
00:16:18,125 --> 00:16:19,416
- GET OUT OF THE WAY!

218
00:16:31,083 --> 00:16:33,958
- GENTOKU, YOU NEED
TO PUT AN END TO THIS.

219
00:16:35,375 --> 00:16:37,291
- SHE'S RIGHT, RYUU-CHAN.

220
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:39,291
YOU WERE ALL
SUCH CLOSE FRIENDS.

221
00:16:39,375 --> 00:16:41,291
NO MATTER
WHAT YOU DID

222
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:43,291
OR WHEN YOU DID IT,
YOU STUCK TOGETHER.

223
00:16:43,375 --> 00:16:45,750
WAS THAT ALL
NOTHING BUT A BIG LIE?

224
00:16:48,041 --> 00:16:51,250
- HAKUFU SONSAKU,
YOU SAY SUCH STUPID THINGS.

225
00:16:51,333 --> 00:16:53,958
OUR FRIENDSHIP
WAS NEVER IN DOUBT.

226
00:16:54,041 --> 00:16:56,625
WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE TODAY
IS SOMETHING ELSE ALTOGETHER.

227
00:16:56,708 --> 00:16:58,125
RIGHT?

228
00:16:59,625 --> 00:17:01,541
WE MAY HAVE BEEN BORN
ON DIFFERENT DAYS,

229
00:17:01,625 --> 00:17:03,916
BUT WHEN IT'S TIME
FOR THE TWO OF US TO DIE,

230
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,250
THROUGH OUR BONDS OF SISTERHOOD,
I VOW WE'LL DIE TOGETHER.

231
00:17:07,333 --> 00:17:09,458
THIS VOW
CAN NEVER BE BROKEN.

232
00:17:13,416 --> 00:17:16,166
GENTOKU, YOU ARE MERELY
BEING CONTROLLED

233
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:17,666
BY SOMEONE ELSE
RIGHT NOW.

234
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:19,625
PLEASE LEAVE
THE TWO OF US.

235
00:17:19,708 --> 00:17:21,583
I WANT TO BE ALONE
WITH GENTOKU.

236
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,458
- YOU GOT IT.
I'LL TAKE ON THE SMALL FRIES.

237
00:17:25,541 --> 00:17:27,041
- WHO'S A SMALL FRY?

238
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,291
- LOOKY HERE, YOU GUYS.
COME CHECK OUT THE FULL MOON.

239
00:17:32,375 --> 00:17:34,125
- WHY, THAT BITCH.

240
00:17:34,208 --> 00:17:36,583
- HOLD IT!
I'LL BE YOUR OPPONENT.

241
00:17:36,666 --> 00:17:39,458
- FINE, GORILLA,
IF THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT.

242
00:17:43,208 --> 00:17:44,958
- ( chuckles )

243
00:17:45,041 --> 00:17:46,291
WELL, KAN'U,

244
00:17:46,375 --> 00:17:49,000
IT SEEMS YOU'RE PREPARED
TO DIE HERE, DOESN'T IT?

245
00:17:49,083 --> 00:17:51,333
- ONLY IF IT'S GENTOKU
WHO KILLS ME.

246
00:17:51,416 --> 00:17:54,291
UNFORTUNATELY THE PERSON
STANDING BEFORE ME NOW

247
00:17:54,375 --> 00:17:58,208
IS BOTH GENTOKU
AND NOT GENTOKU.

248
00:17:58,291 --> 00:18:01,250
- TOO BAD.
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

249
00:18:12,375 --> 00:18:15,000
- GENTOKU, LISTEN.

250
00:18:15,083 --> 00:18:16,458
PLEASE HEAR ME OUT.

251
00:18:16,541 --> 00:18:20,291
THE THINGS I'M ABOUT TO SAY
TO YOU RIGHT NOW

252
00:18:20,375 --> 00:18:22,708
ARE NOT LIES.

253
00:18:22,791 --> 00:18:25,291
I SWEAR IT.

254
00:18:25,375 --> 00:18:27,291
( grunting )

255
00:18:27,375 --> 00:18:30,000
I, UNCHO KAN'U,

256
00:18:30,083 --> 00:18:33,041
CONSIDER MYSELF TO BE
A BLESSED PERSON

257
00:18:33,125 --> 00:18:36,875
BECAUSE I WAS ABLE
TO FIND MYSELF A BRAVE LEADER,

258
00:18:36,958 --> 00:18:40,208
A LEADER WHO I'M MORE
THAN WILLING TO DIE FOR.

259
00:18:40,291 --> 00:18:43,208
I'M GLAD-- I'M GLAD
YOU'RE THE KIND LEADER

260
00:18:43,291 --> 00:18:45,708
WHO DESPISES VIOLENCE
MORE THAN ANYTHING.

261
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:47,708
IT IS BECAUSE OF
THAT REASON

262
00:18:47,791 --> 00:18:49,916
THAT I AM SO WILLING
TO STAND BY YOU

263
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,083
AND BECOME YOUR SHIELD,
TO FIGHT FOR YOU.

264
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:56,708
I WAS BORN-- BORN TO FIGHT,

265
00:18:56,791 --> 00:18:59,041
A FIGHTER FROM DAY ONE.

266
00:18:59,125 --> 00:19:02,375
I'VE ALWAYS BEEN PROUD
OF THAT FACT.

267
00:19:02,458 --> 00:19:06,083
AND YET A PART OF ME
LONGS FOR PEACE.

268
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:14,333
THE TWO OF US
WERE SUPPOSED TO MEET.

269
00:19:14,416 --> 00:19:17,500
THE TWO OF US WERE
DESTINED TO MEET.

270
00:19:20,166 --> 00:19:22,083
MY HEART WILL ALWAYS,

271
00:19:22,166 --> 00:19:24,791
NO MATTER WHAT--

272
00:19:24,875 --> 00:19:27,166
GENTOKU...

273
00:19:28,833 --> 00:19:32,625
IT WILL ALWAYS BE
WITH YOU.

274
00:19:44,291 --> 00:19:45,416
- KAN'U!

275
00:19:51,666 --> 00:19:53,333
- SO IS IT ALL OVER?

276
00:19:59,125 --> 00:20:01,916
- I'M SORRY.
I'M SO SORRY.  PLEASE, KAN'U.

277
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,250
SOMEONE-- SOMEONE
TOOK CONTROL OF MY BODY

278
00:20:05,333 --> 00:20:08,791
AND I-- AND I--
AND I--

279
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:10,833
( sobbing )

280
00:20:12,416 --> 00:20:14,833
- GENTOKU.

281
00:20:17,708 --> 00:20:20,000
I'M GLAD.

282
00:20:36,291 --> 00:20:38,000
- ( crying )

283
00:20:38,083 --> 00:20:40,333
- EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT?

284
00:20:40,416 --> 00:20:43,333
- WHAT WAS THAT?
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

285
00:20:43,416 --> 00:20:46,833
HOW IN THE WORLD CAN MY SPELL
HAVE BEEN BROKEN LIKE THAT?

286
00:20:46,916 --> 00:20:49,500
- WHAT'S THIS?
ARE YOU CRYING?

287
00:20:57,916 --> 00:21:00,041
- ( owl hooting )

288
00:21:22,958 --> 00:21:25,000
- I'VE BEEN LOOKING
FOR YOU.

289
00:21:28,791 --> 00:21:30,000
- RYOFU?

290
00:21:34,166 --> 00:21:35,958
- ( chuckles )

291
00:21:47,291 --> 00:21:49,416
- ( theme music playing )

292
00:22:08,833 --> 00:22:10,916
( singing in Japanese )

293
00:23:18,333 --> 00:23:20,541
- Chou'un: DESPITE EVERYTHING
THAT HAD TRANSPIRED,

294
00:23:20,625 --> 00:23:24,000
KAN'U NEVER LOST HER FAITH AND
CONTINUED TO PROTECT OUR LEADER.

295
00:23:24,083 --> 00:23:25,833
I ADMIRE
HER LOYALTY.

296
00:23:25,916 --> 00:23:28,666
- Ekitoku: BUT OF COURSE THAT'S
OUR ONE AND ONLY SISTER FOR YOU.

297
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:31,041
THE OATH OF THE PEACH
GARDEN AREN'T EMPTY WORDS.

298
00:23:31,125 --> 00:23:33,666
EVEN I, EKITOKU,
WILL GO INTO ACTION

299
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:35,333
WHEN THE SITUATION
CALLS FOR IT.

300
00:23:35,416 --> 00:23:37,333
- Kouchuu: EKITOKU, YOU NEED
TO STOP BULLYING THE LEADER

301
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:39,500
AND LEARN A LESSON OR TWO
FROM KAN'U ON LOYALTY.

302
00:23:39,583 --> 00:23:41,666
- SHUT IT, JERK. I DON'T NEED
TO HEAR THAT FROM SOMEONE

303
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:43,458
WHO THINKS ABOUT
SQUEEZING BOOBIES ALL DAY.

304
00:23:43,541 --> 00:23:45,708
- Kouchuu: WHAT
A THING TO SAY.
