1
00:00:08,333 --> 00:00:10,333
- ( theme music playing )

2
00:00:20,791 --> 00:00:22,791
( singing in Japanese )

3
00:01:37,791 --> 00:01:39,875
- ( insects chirping )

4
00:01:44,083 --> 00:01:46,000
- Ryuubi: KAN'U.
- OH.

5
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:49,500
- YOU MUSTN'T DO THAT.
IT'S NOT GOOD FOR YOU

6
00:01:49,583 --> 00:01:51,083
TO BE SNEAKING OUT OF BED.

7
00:01:51,166 --> 00:01:54,875
- SORRY. I JUST NEEDED TO GET
OUT AND GET SOME FRESH AIR.

8
00:01:54,958 --> 00:01:57,458
- OH HEY, IT'S MY BOOK.

9
00:01:59,458 --> 00:02:01,208
- OH THIS?

10
00:02:01,291 --> 00:02:04,166
I JUST WANTED TO READ IT ONCE
MORE BEFORE RETURNING IT TO YOU.

11
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:06,500
- YOU CAN KEEP IT
IF YOU WANT.

12
00:02:06,583 --> 00:02:09,375
- UH, YEAH, BUT WHEN
YOU GAVE THIS TO ME,

13
00:02:09,458 --> 00:02:11,875
YOU WEREN'T YOURSELF.
- WELL, MAYBE-- MAYBE

14
00:02:11,958 --> 00:02:14,791
IT IS TRUE THAT I WASN'T MYSELF
BACK WHEN I GAVE IT TO YOU.

15
00:02:14,875 --> 00:02:17,791
BUT TO BE HONEST, I'D ALWAYS
THOUGHT IT WOULD BE REALLY NICE

16
00:02:17,875 --> 00:02:19,458
IF YOU'D TAKEN THE
TIME TO READ IT.

17
00:02:19,541 --> 00:02:20,791
- YOU DID?

18
00:02:20,875 --> 00:02:22,708
- I MEAN, DON'T YOU THINK
IT'S A WONDERFUL THING?

19
00:02:22,791 --> 00:02:25,541
THE ABILITY TO GIVE A BOOK
YOU LOVE TO A PERSON YOU LOVE,

20
00:02:25,625 --> 00:02:27,750
IN THE HOPES THAT
THEY MIGHT LOVE IT TOO?

21
00:02:27,833 --> 00:02:29,916
- THE PERSON YOU LOVE?
- YES!

22
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,500
AND THEN WE CAN GROW
TO BECOME EVEN BETTER FRIENDS.

23
00:02:32,583 --> 00:02:35,416
( soft gasp )
ACTUALLY, I'VE BEEN THINKING

24
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:38,375
THAT THE PERSON WHO WAS INSIDE
ME HAD FELT THE SAME EXACT WAY.

25
00:02:38,458 --> 00:02:40,666
- THE SAME EXACT WAY?
- YES.

26
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:43,916
I DON'T KNOW WHY,
BUT SHE SEEMED SO SAD TO ME.

27
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,708
SO I WAS THINKING MAYBE
IT'S THAT SHE JUST WANTED

28
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:48,250
TO BE FRIENDS WITH SOMEBODY.

29
00:02:48,333 --> 00:02:49,208
- HMM.

30
00:03:09,958 --> 00:03:12,375
- ( both panting )

31
00:03:17,041 --> 00:03:19,375
- ( screams )

32
00:03:19,458 --> 00:03:20,708
- CHUBO!

33
00:03:22,458 --> 00:03:23,333
( grunts )

34
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:37,291
- ( chuckles )

35
00:03:37,375 --> 00:03:40,291
ENOUGH OF THIS GAME
OF CAT AND MOUSE.

36
00:03:40,375 --> 00:03:42,291
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN GAME?

37
00:03:42,375 --> 00:03:44,750
WHAT WE'VE HAD ENOUGH OF IS
ALL YOUR CRAZY MAGICAL POWERS!

38
00:03:44,833 --> 00:03:47,125
JUST TURN BACK
TO YOUR NORMAL SELF!

39
00:03:47,208 --> 00:03:50,166
- WHY WOULD I? I'VE NEVER FELT
BETTER IN MY ENTIRE LIFE.

40
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:54,083
EVEN RIGHT NOW I CAN FEEL THIS
POWER COURSING THROUGH MY BODY.

41
00:03:54,166 --> 00:03:57,416
IT'S ALMOST AS IF THE PAIN
FROM BEFORE HAD NEVER HAPPENED.

42
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:58,791
( laughs )

43
00:03:58,875 --> 00:04:01,958
- WHAT POWER DO YOU MEAN?
FROM MOU-CHAN'S DRAGON?

44
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:04,083
- SPEAKING OF WHICH...
WHERE IS MISS RYOMOU?

45
00:04:04,166 --> 00:04:07,000
- THAT'S RIGHT!
WHERE DID MOU-CHAN GO?!

46
00:04:07,083 --> 00:04:09,416
- TURN AROUND, SHE'S
STANDING RIGHT BEHIND YOU.

47
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:15,416
- HUH?!

48
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,083
- ( both gasp )
- LOOK.

49
00:04:17,166 --> 00:04:19,916
I THINK RYOMOU WANTS TO PLAY
HER OWN GAME OF CAT AND MOUSE.

50
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,625
( laughs )

51
00:04:28,416 --> 00:04:29,708
- ( gasps )

52
00:04:33,291 --> 00:04:35,083
- MOU-CHAN?
- ( yells )

53
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:42,750
- ( gasps ) BIG SISTER!

54
00:04:46,375 --> 00:04:49,083
WAKE UP!
PLEASE YOU HAVE TO WAKE UP.

55
00:04:49,166 --> 00:04:51,166
GET UP NOW!

56
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:54,791
- ( footsteps )

57
00:04:55,916 --> 00:04:57,958
UH?
( grunts )

58
00:05:00,041 --> 00:05:03,083
- YOU'RE FIGHTING THE WRONG
PERSON, SHIMEI RYOMOU.

59
00:05:08,833 --> 00:05:11,375
LET'S SEE HOW MUCH STRONGER
YOU'VE REALLY BECOME.

60
00:05:11,458 --> 00:05:13,416
CONSIDER FIGHTING ME

61
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,250
YOUR ULTIMATE
TEST OF STRENGTH.

62
00:05:19,291 --> 00:05:20,916
- ( moans )

63
00:05:24,625 --> 00:05:26,291
WHA-- WHAT THE...?

64
00:05:29,166 --> 00:05:31,750
FUU-CHIN? HUH.

65
00:05:31,833 --> 00:05:33,958
COULD IT BE?
- ( chuckles )

66
00:05:35,125 --> 00:05:37,791
THAT LUNCH AT THE PARK
WAS DELICIOUS.

67
00:05:37,875 --> 00:05:40,166
- AWESOME!
YOU'RE BACK, FUU-CHIN!

68
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:43,416
- LOOKS LIKE WE'VE GOT A FEW
MORE PROBLEMS ON OUR HANDS.

69
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,250
- YEAH YEAH, WE REALLY DO.

70
00:05:45,333 --> 00:05:47,625
IT SEEMS LIKE SOMETHING'S
REALLY WRONG WITH MOU-CHAN.

71
00:05:47,708 --> 00:05:49,125
- SO THAT'S IT.

72
00:05:49,208 --> 00:05:51,333
I CAN ONLY IMAGINE
THAT SHE'S UNDER THE SAME

73
00:05:51,416 --> 00:05:54,333
MIND-CONTROL SPELL THAT
GENPOU SAJI PUT ON ME BEFORE.

74
00:05:54,416 --> 00:05:56,458
- MISS RYOMOU...

75
00:05:57,583 --> 00:05:59,916
HUH?
( screams )

76
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,333
- CHUBO!
- BIG SISTER!

77
00:06:03,416 --> 00:06:05,625
- JUST HURRY UP
AND GO AFTER HER.

78
00:06:05,708 --> 00:06:08,166
SHE'S YOUR SISTER, RIGHT?
- RIGHT!

79
00:06:13,958 --> 00:06:16,666
- COME ON! NO TIME FOR YOU
TO SIT AROUND STARING!

80
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:19,416
HURRY!
- RIGHT. I'M ON IT!

81
00:06:20,541 --> 00:06:21,958
- ( thinking )
I WISH YOU LUCK.

82
00:06:22,041 --> 00:06:24,625
IF ONLY I COULD HAVE SPENT
A BIT MORE TIME WITH YOU.

83
00:06:24,708 --> 00:06:27,500
OKAY, HOW ABOUT THE TWO OF US
HAVE SOME FUN?

84
00:06:33,333 --> 00:06:35,458
- WE'VE DECIDED WE'RE GOING
BACK TO KYOSHO.

85
00:06:35,541 --> 00:06:38,916
LOOKS LIKE
MOUTOKU'S FINALLY BACK.

86
00:06:46,583 --> 00:06:47,833
- ( rumbling )
- HUH?

87
00:06:47,916 --> 00:06:50,000
OH NO!

88
00:06:52,791 --> 00:06:56,625
- FROM DAY ONE I SUFFERED
HAVING BEEN BORN A NECROMANCER.

89
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:59,416
SUCH WAS THE DESTINY
I HAD TO BEAR.

90
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,458
FIGHTERS COULD
NEVER UNDERSTAND

91
00:07:01,541 --> 00:07:03,583
WHAT IT IS I HAD
TO GO THROUGH.

92
00:07:03,666 --> 00:07:05,791
LIKE THE MOST PRIMAL
OF SPECIES,

93
00:07:05,875 --> 00:07:07,333
YOU SIMPLY FIGHT EACH
OTHER IN HOPES OF

94
00:07:07,416 --> 00:07:10,666
SHOWING OFF YOUR STRENGTH.
AND IF THAT'S ALL IT TAKES,

95
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:14,125
I'LL HELP YOU CRUSH EACH OTHER,
UNTIL THERE'S NO ONE LEFT.

96
00:07:14,208 --> 00:07:16,125
YES,

97
00:07:16,208 --> 00:07:19,166
THIS IS THE TERRIBLE DESTINY
I WAS BURDENED WITH.

98
00:07:21,708 --> 00:07:24,000
NOW WITH THE DRAGON'S
MAGNIFICENT POWER

99
00:07:24,083 --> 00:07:26,666
I HAVE FINALLY BECOME
THE TRUE GENPOU SAJI.

100
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:28,791
AND WITH THIS POWER

101
00:07:28,875 --> 00:07:31,291
I NO LONGER NEED
THE HELP OF ANYONE ELSE.

102
00:07:42,625 --> 00:07:45,125
LOOKS LIKE I'VE CAUGHT
ANOTHER ONE.

103
00:07:45,208 --> 00:07:47,500
I'LL BE WITH YOU
IN A MOMENT.

104
00:07:47,583 --> 00:07:49,416
- HOW DARE YOU DO
THIS TO CHUBO.

105
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,875
- DON'T COME NEAR!
( yelps )

106
00:07:51,958 --> 00:07:54,125
- YOU'D BETTER LET CHUBO
GO RIGHT NOW!

107
00:07:54,208 --> 00:07:56,916
- LET HER GO?
NOT A CHANCE.

108
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,875
IF I DID THAT, THEN I'D HAVE
TO START ALL OVER AGAIN.

109
00:08:01,125 --> 00:08:02,416
ATTACK!

110
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:07,291
- DAMN YOU!
LET HER GO!

111
00:08:11,333 --> 00:08:13,375
TAKE THAT AND THAT!

112
00:08:13,458 --> 00:08:15,041
AND THAT!
AND THAT!

113
00:08:18,333 --> 00:08:19,291
( gasps )

114
00:08:25,375 --> 00:08:28,166
- ( screams )
- HAKUFU!

115
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:32,750
- GOOD JOB, BIG BROTHER!
NICE CATCH!

116
00:08:32,833 --> 00:08:33,750
- ( groans )

117
00:08:33,833 --> 00:08:36,250
- WAIT, IS THAT...
GENPOU SAJI?

118
00:08:36,333 --> 00:08:39,583
- MM-MM. THIS IS WHAT HAPPENED
WHEN SHE WAS TRANSFORMED

119
00:08:39,666 --> 00:08:41,458
BY THE POWER
OF MOU-CHAN'S DRAGON.

120
00:08:41,541 --> 00:08:43,750
- RYOMOU'S DRAGON?
NOW I UNDERSTAND

121
00:08:43,833 --> 00:08:46,916
WHY GENPOU SAJI WENT THROUGH THE
TROUBLE OF KIDNAPPING RYOMOU.

122
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,833
- KOUKIN, WHAT'S GONNA
HAPPEN TO HER NOW?

123
00:08:49,916 --> 00:08:52,000
- HER FUTURE DOESN'T
LOOK VERY GOOD.

124
00:08:52,083 --> 00:08:54,208
IT IS SAID THE POWER
OF THE DRAGON WILL CONSUME

125
00:08:54,291 --> 00:08:56,875
WHOMEVER IT INHABITS.
- THEN YOU'RE SAYING

126
00:08:56,958 --> 00:08:59,291
GENPOU SAJI'S LIFE
IS IN DANGER?

127
00:08:59,375 --> 00:09:01,625
- Chubo: THIS WON'T
SOLVE ANYTHING.

128
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:04,083
- Chubo: NONE OF THIS WILL
SOLVE ANYTHING FOR YOU.

129
00:09:04,166 --> 00:09:06,458
- OH, BUT IT WILL.

130
00:09:06,541 --> 00:09:08,583
I WASN'T BLUFFING WHEN
I TOLD YOU I'D GET RID

131
00:09:08,666 --> 00:09:10,625
OF EVERY SINGLE FIGHTER
ON THIS EARTH.

132
00:09:10,708 --> 00:09:12,125
- Chubo:
YOU POOR, POOR SOUL.

133
00:09:12,208 --> 00:09:15,500
YOU'RE SO SCARRED BY THE PAINFUL
MEMORIES OF YOUR PAST.

134
00:09:15,583 --> 00:09:19,083
THAT'S WHY YOU
DON'T EVEN REALIZE

135
00:09:19,166 --> 00:09:21,625
THAT YOU'VE BECOME A PUPPET
TO YOUR HATEFUL FEELINGS!

136
00:09:21,708 --> 00:09:23,958
YOU CAN'T CONTROL YOUR FATE.
- ( grunts )

137
00:09:24,041 --> 00:09:26,750
- Chubo: ALL THE FIGHTERS
YOU CLAIM TO LOATHE...

138
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:29,041
EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM
IS DOING THEIR BEST

139
00:09:29,125 --> 00:09:32,791
TO BATTLE THEIR DESTINIES, TO
MAKE THEIR LIVES THEIR VERY OWN.

140
00:09:32,875 --> 00:09:36,000
EVEN WITH THE DRAGON'S POWERS
AND ODDS STACKING AGAINST THEM,

141
00:09:36,083 --> 00:09:37,750
I PROMISE YOU
THEIR NOBLE SPIRITS

142
00:09:37,833 --> 00:09:39,583
WILL NOT SO EASILY
BE EXTINGUISHED.

143
00:09:39,666 --> 00:09:41,375
- SHUT UP!

144
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:46,708
- ( gasps )

145
00:09:54,083 --> 00:09:57,958
- I THINK I'VE BEEN LECTURED
ENOUGH BY THE LIKES OF YOU.

146
00:09:58,041 --> 00:10:00,833
I'LL HAVE THE DRAGON DEVOUR
ALL THOSE SILLY FEELINGS.

147
00:10:00,916 --> 00:10:03,458
ANY THOUGHTS OF SENTIMENTALITY
WILL BE GONE.

148
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:11,416
( chuckles )

149
00:10:15,458 --> 00:10:17,166
( huffs )
- OH NO!

150
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:19,166
WE HAVE DO SOMETHING
TO HELP HER!

151
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:21,041
- I'M RIGHT BEHIND YOU,
HAKUFU!

152
00:10:21,125 --> 00:10:23,250
- RIGHT!
- WHY'RE YOU HOLDING BACK?

153
00:10:23,333 --> 00:10:25,708
YOU SHOULD BE TERRIFIED.

154
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:29,083
IF YOU'RE AFRAID,
THEN YOU SHOULD BE SCREAMING.

155
00:10:30,791 --> 00:10:32,833
- Chubo: IT'S YOU.
- ( gasps )

156
00:10:32,916 --> 00:10:34,291
- YOU'VE LOST SIGHT
OF WHO YOU ARE

157
00:10:34,375 --> 00:10:36,250
BECAUSE OF THE DRAGON'S POWER

158
00:10:36,333 --> 00:10:38,708
AND ONE WHO'S LOST SIGHT
CAN'T KILL ME.

159
00:10:38,791 --> 00:10:41,083
- ( grunts )
- CHUBO!

160
00:10:41,166 --> 00:10:43,708
- VERY WELL THEN!
YOU LEAVE ME WITH NO CHOICE

161
00:10:43,791 --> 00:10:46,250
BUT TO START WITH THOSE TWO!
- LET'S DO THIS!

162
00:10:46,333 --> 00:10:47,583
- RIGHT!

163
00:10:51,791 --> 00:10:53,291
- ( all yelp )

164
00:10:55,291 --> 00:10:57,166
- HOLD ON.
WHAT HAPPENED JUST NOW?

165
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,875
- BUT HOW?
MY DRAGON, IT'S...

166
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:19,041
( moans )

167
00:11:19,125 --> 00:11:21,208
IT HURTS. IT HURTS.

168
00:11:21,291 --> 00:11:23,416
MY HEAD...

169
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,833
- WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH HER?
- MAYBE...

170
00:11:25,916 --> 00:11:28,791
DO YOU THINK IT'S THAT SHE
CAN'T USE HER MAGIC ANYMORE?

171
00:11:28,875 --> 00:11:30,666
- OR PERHAPS SHE'S
JUST NO LONGER ABLE TO

172
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:31,916
CONTROL THE DRAGON ANYMORE.

173
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,875
- ( gasps )
- THAT'S IT.

174
00:11:33,958 --> 00:11:36,500
THE EFFORT EXCEEDS
HER PHYSICAL CAPABILITIES.

175
00:11:36,583 --> 00:11:39,708
- ( straining ) IT HURTS.
I CAN'T BREATHE.

176
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,458
( screams )
- ( gasps )

177
00:11:53,041 --> 00:11:55,208
- ARE-- ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

178
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,416
- THE DRAGON...
- HUH?

179
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:02,125
- THE POWER OF THE DRAGON,
I CAN'T FEEL IT ANYMORE.

180
00:12:02,208 --> 00:12:04,541
IT'S COMPLETELY GONE.
IT CAN'T BE.

181
00:12:04,625 --> 00:12:07,000
IT CAN'T BE!
( sobbing )

182
00:12:07,083 --> 00:12:09,333
PLEASE DON'T LET IT BE
GONE FOREVER.

183
00:12:09,416 --> 00:12:11,625
WITHOUT THAT POWER

184
00:12:11,708 --> 00:12:13,916
I'LL BE LIKE BEFORE.

185
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:22,000
- NO, NOBODY HERE IS GOING
TO HURT YOU ANYMORE, OKAY?

186
00:12:23,333 --> 00:12:24,833
YOU UNDERSTAND?

187
00:12:24,916 --> 00:12:27,958
YOU DON'T NEED THE DRAGON'S
POWER TO FEEL SAFE.

188
00:12:28,041 --> 00:12:30,125
THERE'S ONLY ONE THING
YOU NEED IN LIFE.

189
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:31,666
- Hakufu: THAT'S RIGHT!
- Both: HUH?

190
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:34,041
- THE MOST IMPORTANT THING
YOU'LL EVER NEED

191
00:12:34,125 --> 00:12:37,958
ARE FRIENDS LIKE...
US.

192
00:12:39,416 --> 00:12:41,791
- YOU'D BE MY FRIEND?
- YEP.

193
00:12:41,875 --> 00:12:45,375
I'M HAKUFU SONSAKU.
- AND I'M KOUKIN SHUYUU.

194
00:12:45,458 --> 00:12:47,750
- MY NAME IS CHUBO SONKEN.
WHAT'S YOURS?

195
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:54,791
- MY NAME IS...

196
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:59,625
- DON'T YOU DARE INTERFERE!

197
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,041
- MY NAME IS...

198
00:13:22,125 --> 00:13:24,583
GENPOU SAJI.

199
00:13:24,666 --> 00:13:27,833
- THERE WE GO. WE FINALLY
HEARD YOU SAY YOUR OWN NAME.

200
00:13:29,333 --> 00:13:31,500
- ( chuckles )

201
00:13:38,041 --> 00:13:40,291
- ( singing in Japanese )

202
00:13:46,875 --> 00:13:50,041
- Ryofu: FOR ME, DEATH WAS
THE PRICE I HAD TO PAY.

203
00:13:52,875 --> 00:13:56,083
BY MY OWN CHOICE
AND WITH MY OWN STRENGTH,

204
00:13:56,166 --> 00:13:59,750
I DID MORE THAN MERELY
LIVE OUT MY PREDESTINED FATE.

205
00:13:59,833 --> 00:14:02,375
I HAD A LIFE OF MY OWN!
AND SO CAN YOU!

206
00:14:02,458 --> 00:14:04,583
DESPITE WHAT YOU THINK
YOU WANT OUT OF LIFE,

207
00:14:04,666 --> 00:14:07,500
I CAN'T ALLOW YOU
TO GIVE UP NOW!

208
00:14:07,583 --> 00:14:08,750
- ( gasps )

209
00:14:09,833 --> 00:14:11,375
- ( grunts )

210
00:14:11,458 --> 00:14:14,375
- ( singing continues )

211
00:14:38,625 --> 00:14:40,125
- ( grunting )

212
00:14:54,666 --> 00:14:57,875
- RYOMOU, LISTEN TO ME!

213
00:14:57,958 --> 00:15:00,791
SINCE AS FAR BACK
AS I CAN REMEMBER

214
00:15:00,875 --> 00:15:02,416
I FOUGHT MY DESTINY,

215
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,041
BELIEVING WITHOUT A
DOUBT I COULD CHANGE IT.

216
00:15:04,125 --> 00:15:07,000
AND EVEN IF MY CHANCES
WERE LESS THAN 1%

217
00:15:07,083 --> 00:15:08,875
IT WAS WORTH FIGHTING FOR!

218
00:15:08,958 --> 00:15:11,625
BUT TIME PASSED
AND FEAR CREPT IN

219
00:15:11,708 --> 00:15:14,333
AND I WONDERED,
"IS IT ALL WORTH IT?"

220
00:15:14,416 --> 00:15:17,291
SOME PEOPLE MIGHT SAY
THAT I WASTED MY LIFE,

221
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:19,250
THAT I WAS TRYING TO
FIGHT AGAINST FORCES

222
00:15:19,333 --> 00:15:21,041
MORE POWERFUL THAN
I COULD IMAGINE,

223
00:15:21,125 --> 00:15:23,666
BUT I DON'T REGRET
ANY OF IT!

224
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:26,250
PROMISE YOU'LL NEVER
LET ANYONE CONTROL

225
00:15:26,333 --> 00:15:27,791
WHAT YOU DO
WITH YOUR OWN LIFE.

226
00:15:30,416 --> 00:15:32,291
- WHAT'RE YOU...

227
00:15:32,375 --> 00:15:33,750
WHAT ARE YOU TRYING
TO TELL ME?

228
00:15:33,833 --> 00:15:36,791
- PROMISE YOU WILL LIVE
AS YOUR OWN HEART DESIRES,

229
00:15:36,875 --> 00:15:39,166
LIVE YOUR OWN LIFE!

230
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:41,041
- RYOFU.

231
00:15:44,416 --> 00:15:46,041
- MOU-CHAN! FUU-CHIN!

232
00:15:50,125 --> 00:15:52,541
- ( chuckles )
SONSAKU...

233
00:15:52,625 --> 00:15:55,458
I GUESS THIS IS IT.
- ( gasps )

234
00:15:55,541 --> 00:15:56,708
FUU-CHIN.

235
00:15:56,791 --> 00:16:00,666
- IT WAS A LOT OF FUN
BEING HERE WITH YOU.

236
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:02,166
- HUH?

237
00:16:03,916 --> 00:16:05,750
- ( ragged breathing )

238
00:16:09,333 --> 00:16:11,541
- SEE YA, RYOMOU.

239
00:16:12,666 --> 00:16:14,625
- ( gasps )
PLEASE WAIT!

240
00:16:18,208 --> 00:16:19,916
- Ryofu: GOODBYE.

241
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,833
- ( sobbing )

242
00:16:47,916 --> 00:16:50,666
THAT DAMN FOOL.

243
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:53,791
WHY'D SHE HAVE TO DIE AGAIN?

244
00:16:55,916 --> 00:16:57,958
I DIDN'T WANT HER TO GO!

245
00:17:15,458 --> 00:17:18,291
- ( no dialogue )

246
00:18:39,791 --> 00:18:42,041
- ( no dialogue )

247
00:18:56,375 --> 00:19:00,958
- ( birds chirping )

248
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,791
- Ryofu's voice: THANK YOU.
- ( gasps )

249
00:19:29,291 --> 00:19:32,125
( sobbing )

250
00:19:33,916 --> 00:19:36,625
- Chubo: WELL, I GUESS
THIS IS GOODBYE.

251
00:19:36,708 --> 00:19:38,250
- Hakufu: DO YOU
REALLY HAVE TO GO?

252
00:19:38,333 --> 00:19:39,583
- YES.

253
00:19:39,666 --> 00:19:41,416
I WANT TO STAY, BUT I
PROMISED MASTER CHOUSHOU.

254
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:44,458
- COME ON! CAN'T YOU SAY
YOU DON'T WANT TO GO?

255
00:19:44,541 --> 00:19:45,875
UH?

256
00:19:48,208 --> 00:19:50,041
- BIG SISTER...

257
00:19:50,125 --> 00:19:52,916
- ( sighs )
( forced laugh )

258
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,791
SAT-CHAN!
- HUH?

259
00:19:55,875 --> 00:19:58,708
- NOW IF ANYONE
EVER PICKS ON YOU,

260
00:19:58,791 --> 00:20:00,958
THEN YOU COME AND TELL ME
RIGHT AWAY, YA HEAR?

261
00:20:01,041 --> 00:20:03,625
I'LL BEAT THEIR ASS
TILL THEY SCREAM LIKE A GIRL.

262
00:20:03,708 --> 00:20:06,375
- ( chuckling )

263
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:09,666
- Chubo: I WANT TO SAY

264
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:12,583
THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING
YOU'VE DONE FOR ME.

265
00:20:12,666 --> 00:20:14,625
MANY THINGS HAPPENED
WHILE I WAS HERE,

266
00:20:14,708 --> 00:20:17,333
- BUT EVERY DAY
WAS SO MUCH FUN. MM.

267
00:20:19,416 --> 00:20:21,458
WELL, GOODBYE.
- Hakufu: NO.

268
00:20:21,541 --> 00:20:25,166
IT'S NEVER BE GOODBYE WITH US.
IT'S "SEE YOU LATER."

269
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:27,791
YOU'RE ALWAYS SUCH
A SCATTERBRAIN, CHUBO.

270
00:20:29,666 --> 00:20:32,458
- OH MY. I GUESS I REALLY
AM YOUR YOUNGER SISTER.

271
00:20:32,541 --> 00:20:34,041
- RIGHT!

272
00:20:34,125 --> 00:20:36,750
NO MATTER WHAT YOU'LL ALWAYS
BE MY PRECIOUS LITTLE SISTER.

273
00:20:36,833 --> 00:20:38,708
AND THAT'S WHY...

274
00:20:38,791 --> 00:20:40,666
- ( signing in Japanese )

275
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,916
- YOU CAN COME BACK TO VISIT US
ANYTIME YOU WANT!

276
00:20:47,916 --> 00:20:49,208
- ( gasps )

277
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:55,666
YES!

278
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:02,500
- Koukin: AND SO ANOTHER CHAPTER
HAS ENDED.

279
00:21:02,583 --> 00:21:04,666
WE'RE ALREADY DASHING ONWARD

280
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:06,791
IN SEARCH OF NEW TOMORROWS.

281
00:21:06,875 --> 00:21:08,583
WE KEEP ON PUSHING FORWARD

282
00:21:08,666 --> 00:21:11,000
THOUGH WE DON'T KNOW
WHAT LIES AHEAD.

283
00:21:11,083 --> 00:21:12,500
BUT THAT DIDN'T MATTER.

284
00:21:12,583 --> 00:21:15,166
THROUGH IT ALL,
RYOFU TAUGHT US THE IMPORTANCE

285
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:17,125
OF CARVING OUT
OUR OWN DESTINIES.

286
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:23,416
AND WHILE OUR FATES
MAY BE TIED TO SOULS

287
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:25,750
FROM 1800 YEARS IN THE PAST,

288
00:21:25,833 --> 00:21:27,833
WE WILL LIVE OUR OWN LIVES

289
00:21:27,916 --> 00:21:30,000
OF OUR OWN CHOOSING.

290
00:21:30,083 --> 00:21:32,375
WE TAKE PRIDE IN WHO WE ARE

291
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:33,750
AND WHO WE MAY YET BECOME.

292
00:21:35,666 --> 00:21:38,333
WE ARE FIGHTERS.

293
00:21:47,458 --> 00:21:49,250
- ( theme music playing )

294
00:21:52,916 --> 00:21:54,666
- ( vocalizing )
