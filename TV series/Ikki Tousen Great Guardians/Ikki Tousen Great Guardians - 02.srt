1
00:01:44,666 --> 00:01:47,166
- MMM!  SO REFRESHING.

2
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:51,083
MORNING BATHS ARE THE BEST.
- ( door opens )

3
00:01:54,875 --> 00:01:57,291
- GOOD MORNING,
BIG SISTER HAKUFU.

4
00:01:57,375 --> 00:01:59,958
DO YOU NEED HELP
WASHING YOUR BACK?

5
00:02:07,625 --> 00:02:11,000
- Goei: KOUKIN!
- YES, AUNT GOEI?

6
00:02:11,083 --> 00:02:12,875
- GO TELL HAKUFU SHE'S BEEN
IN THE TUB LONG ENOUGH

7
00:02:12,958 --> 00:02:14,583
FOR ONE MORNING.

8
00:02:14,666 --> 00:02:16,125
BREAKFAST IS ALMOST READY.

9
00:02:16,208 --> 00:02:18,708
- SURE, AUNT GOEI.
I'LL GET HER.

10
00:02:20,375 --> 00:02:22,125
- SHE'S COMING HOME WITH US?

11
00:02:22,208 --> 00:02:23,958
- WHAT CHOICE DO WE HAVE?
MAMA JUST SAID TO

12
00:02:24,041 --> 00:02:26,625
BE SURE TO BRING HER BACK
TO THE HOUSE. I DIDN'T ARGUE.

13
00:02:26,708 --> 00:02:28,750
- I'M STILL NOT SURE
THAT I BUY IT.

14
00:02:28,833 --> 00:02:31,583
HOW COULD YOU HAVE A SISTER?
- Goei: WELCOME HOME.

15
00:02:31,666 --> 00:02:34,416
- AUNT GOEI.
- HI.

16
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,833
WE'RE HOME, MOM.
- OH, DEAR.

17
00:02:36,916 --> 00:02:38,500
WHAT AM I GOING
TO DO WITH YOU?

18
00:02:38,583 --> 00:02:40,500
YOU'VE GONE
AND TORN YOUR UNIFORM AGAIN.

19
00:02:40,583 --> 00:02:43,708
- UH, THERE'S ACTUALLY
A PRETTY LONG STORY BEHIND THIS,

20
00:02:43,791 --> 00:02:45,041
OR MAYBE NOT.

21
00:02:48,958 --> 00:02:51,458
- FINALLY.
HERE YOU ARE.

22
00:02:51,541 --> 00:02:53,916
- Both: HUH?

23
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,833
- MY NAME IS CHUUBO SONKEN,
AND I'M 16.

24
00:02:57,916 --> 00:02:59,625
PLEASED TO MEET YOU.

25
00:02:59,708 --> 00:03:01,333
- I KNOW YOU ALREADY
MET, BUT WHY DON'T YOU

26
00:03:01,416 --> 00:03:03,666
REINTRODUCE YOURSELVES?
- RIGHT!

27
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:06,500
I'M HAKUFU SONSAKU,
AND I'M 16 YEARS OLD.

28
00:03:06,583 --> 00:03:09,500
- I'M KOUKIN SHUYU,
AND I'M 16 JUST LIKE YOU GUYS.

29
00:03:09,583 --> 00:03:11,666
IT'S A PLEASURE TO MEET YOU,
MISS SONKEN.

30
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:14,041
- MISS SONKEN THEN?

31
00:03:14,125 --> 00:03:15,208
THAT'S FINE.

32
00:03:15,291 --> 00:03:17,208
- HUH?
THAT'S YOUR NAME?

33
00:03:17,291 --> 00:03:20,208
- IT'S JUST THAT I HEARD
YOU AND BIG SISTER HAKUFU

34
00:03:20,291 --> 00:03:22,791
HAD BEEN RAISED TOGETHER
LIKE BROTHER AND SISTER.

35
00:03:22,875 --> 00:03:24,208
- YEAH, THAT'S CORRECT.

36
00:03:24,291 --> 00:03:26,416
- IN THAT CASE,
IF YOU DON'T MIND,

37
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,208
DO YOU THINK YOU COULD
JUST CALL ME "CHUUBO"

38
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:31,500
THE WAY YOU CALL BIG SISTER
HAKUFU BY HER FIRST NAME?

39
00:03:31,583 --> 00:03:34,750
IF I'M ASKING TOO MUCH,
THEN YOU DON'T HAVE TO.

40
00:03:34,833 --> 00:03:36,750
- NO.
THAT'S NOT ASKING TOO MUCH.

41
00:03:36,833 --> 00:03:39,500
I CAN DO THAT.
FROM NOW ON, YOU'RE CHUUBO.

42
00:03:39,583 --> 00:03:40,708
- THANKS.

43
00:03:40,791 --> 00:03:42,875
THAT REALLY MAKES US
FEEL LIKE FAMILY.

44
00:03:42,958 --> 00:03:44,916
YOU'RE THE BEST, BIG BROTHER.
- UM...

45
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,916
DID YOU SAY BIG BROTHER?
- YES.

46
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,500
- THAT SOUNDS PRETTY COOL.

47
00:03:49,583 --> 00:03:51,333
- AHEM!

48
00:03:51,416 --> 00:03:53,541
HELLO.  MY NAME IS GOEI.

49
00:03:53,625 --> 00:03:56,291
I'M YOUR MAMA,
AND I'M JUST 17 YEARS OLD.

50
00:03:56,375 --> 00:03:58,625
- ( all laugh nervously )

51
00:04:00,708 --> 00:04:03,791
- CHUUBO, HUH?

52
00:04:03,875 --> 00:04:06,750
HAKUFU, AUNT GOEI SAYS YOU HAVE
TO GET OUT OF THE TUB NOW--

53
00:04:06,833 --> 00:04:09,625
HUH?
- BIG BROTHER!

54
00:04:13,333 --> 00:04:14,625
- AH!

55
00:04:16,166 --> 00:04:17,791
- BIG BROTHER?!

56
00:04:19,541 --> 00:04:22,625
- BREAKFAST TIME.

57
00:04:22,708 --> 00:04:25,625
- HAKUFU, DON'T FORGET
TO CHEW YOUR FOOD THOROUGHLY.

58
00:04:25,708 --> 00:04:27,541
- MORE, PLEASE, MAMA.

59
00:04:27,625 --> 00:04:29,791
- MY IDIOT DAUGHTER--
ALWAYS TUNING ME OUT.

60
00:04:29,875 --> 00:04:32,166
I DON'T THINK YOU'RE EVER
GOING TO LISTEN TO A WORD I SAY.

61
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:33,500
- WHAT'S THE MATTER, KOUKIN?

62
00:04:33,583 --> 00:04:35,250
YOU HAVEN'T EATEN A BITE
OF YOUR FOOD.

63
00:04:35,333 --> 00:04:37,541
- I GUESS I'M JUST NOT HUNGRY.

64
00:04:37,625 --> 00:04:40,625
- WAIT,
IT'S ALL MY FAULT ISN'T IT?

65
00:04:40,708 --> 00:04:43,041
I'VE BEEN ALOOF AND DISTANT
ALL THROUGH BREAKFAST.

66
00:04:43,125 --> 00:04:45,083
- NO, DON'T BLAME YOURSELF.
IT'S NOT YOU.

67
00:04:45,166 --> 00:04:46,291
IT'S NOT YOU AT ALL.

68
00:04:46,375 --> 00:04:48,125
- WHAT ARE YOU GOING
ALL TO PIECES OVER?

69
00:04:48,208 --> 00:04:49,958
I THOUGHT YOU'RE USED
TO SEEING ME IN THE BUFF.

70
00:04:50,041 --> 00:04:51,500
- WELL, SURE,
I'VE SEEN YOU NAKED.

71
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:54,166
- DID I JUST HEAR YOU RIGHT,
BIG BROTHER KOUKIN?

72
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:57,208
- OH, SURE.  THE TWO OF US
ARE ALWAYS NAKED TOGETHER.

73
00:04:57,291 --> 00:04:59,166
EVER SINCE WE WERE LITTLE KIDS.
- HUH?

74
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:01,708
- HEY, WHEN YOU SAY IT LIKE
THAT, IT SOUNDS CREEPY.

75
00:05:01,791 --> 00:05:03,125
TRY PUTTING IT
A DIFFERENT WAY.

76
00:05:03,208 --> 00:05:05,083
- I GUESS WE'RE NOT NAKED
ALL THE TIME.

77
00:05:05,166 --> 00:05:06,500
- YOU'RE NOT HELPING.

78
00:05:06,583 --> 00:05:08,625
- THEN WE'RE ONLY NUDE
WHEN WE PLAY TOGETHER.

79
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:10,125
- NOW YOU'RE MAKING IT WORSE!

80
00:05:10,208 --> 00:05:11,291
- Goei: THE PAPERWORK
FOR REGISTERING

81
00:05:11,375 --> 00:05:14,416
CHUUBO AT NANYO ACADEMY
IS ALL FILLED OUT.

82
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,083
- OKAY.
I'LL DROP IT OFF.

83
00:05:16,166 --> 00:05:18,291
UM, AUNT GOEI?

84
00:05:18,375 --> 00:05:21,125
CHUUBO-- IS SHE REALLY
YOUR DAUGHTER TOO?

85
00:05:21,208 --> 00:05:22,833
- STOP WORRYING.

86
00:05:22,916 --> 00:05:24,500
DON'T SWEAT THE SMALL STUFF.

87
00:05:24,583 --> 00:05:25,916
YOU'LL GET WRINKLES
ON YOUR FOREHEAD.

88
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,625
- OKAY.

89
00:05:27,708 --> 00:05:29,916
- Chuubo: BIG BROTHER KOUKIN?

90
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,333
- KOUKIN,
WE'RE READY TO GO.

91
00:05:32,416 --> 00:05:33,458
- GREAT.

92
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:35,750
NOW GET TO SCHOOL
AND STUDY HARD.

93
00:05:42,416 --> 00:05:43,666
- LOOK OUT!
- OH!

94
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:45,333
- YOU HAVE TO WATCH
WHERE YOU'RE GOING

95
00:05:45,416 --> 00:05:46,666
OR YOU COULD GET HURT.

96
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:50,000
OH.
UM, I'M SORRY.

97
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:52,375
- UM, THANK YOU
FOR HELPING ME.

98
00:05:52,458 --> 00:05:54,625
- HEY, YOU GUYS!

99
00:05:54,708 --> 00:05:57,833
WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?
WE'RE GONNA BE LATE FOR SCHOOL.

100
00:05:57,916 --> 00:05:59,333
- Chuubo: RIGHT.

101
00:05:59,416 --> 00:06:00,708
SORRY, I GOT A LITTLE
DISTRACTED.

102
00:06:00,791 --> 00:06:02,250
- WHAT'S THAT?

103
00:06:02,333 --> 00:06:04,916
YOUR FACE IS ALL RED AND YOU
SEEM TO BE SWEATING TOO.

104
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,875
KOUKIN, COME HERE.
I THINK SHE MIGHT BE SICK.

105
00:06:07,958 --> 00:06:11,041
NOPE.  NO FEVER.

106
00:06:11,125 --> 00:06:13,708
- THANKS, BUT I DON'T THINK
THERE'S ANYTHING WRONG WITH ME.

107
00:06:13,791 --> 00:06:15,791
I'M PROBABLY JUST NERVOUS.

108
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:18,125
IT IS MY FIRST DAY OF SCHOOL,
AFTER ALL.

109
00:06:18,208 --> 00:06:19,541
- DON'T WORRY ABOUT A THING.

110
00:06:19,625 --> 00:06:21,041
IF ANYONE
TRIES TO MESS WITH YOU,

111
00:06:21,125 --> 00:06:22,541
I'LL BEAT THEIR ASS SO BADLY

112
00:06:22,625 --> 00:06:24,250
THAT THEY'LL SCREAM
LIKE A WEAK LITTLE GIRL.

113
00:06:24,333 --> 00:06:26,375
- YOU--
YOU'LL BEAT THEIR ASS?

114
00:06:30,833 --> 00:06:32,708
- ( laughs nervously )

115
00:06:32,791 --> 00:06:36,375
- YOU'RE SONSAKU'S SISTER?

116
00:06:36,458 --> 00:06:39,208
- THAT'S RIGHT, I AM.

117
00:06:39,291 --> 00:06:43,041
IT'S A PLEASURE TO MEET YOU.

118
00:06:43,125 --> 00:06:45,083
- IT'S A PLEASURE
TO MEET YOU TOO.

119
00:06:45,166 --> 00:06:47,875
INCIDENTALLY,
DO YOU LIKE SWEETS?

120
00:06:47,958 --> 00:06:50,083
- GAKU-CHAN HERE
HAS A SUPER HUGE SWEET TOOTH.

121
00:06:50,166 --> 00:06:51,750
- YOU HAVE A SWEET TOOTH?

122
00:06:51,833 --> 00:06:53,708
THAT'S GREAT.
I DO TOO.

123
00:06:53,791 --> 00:06:55,500
- AWESOME.

124
00:06:55,583 --> 00:06:57,041
THEN YOU HAVE TO TRY
THE GREEN TEA MOCHI SUNDAE

125
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:58,791
THEY MAKE OUT AT CHOUKOU.

126
00:06:58,875 --> 00:07:01,416
IT'S A LITTLE MOM &amp; POP SHOP
OUT PAST THE TRAIN STATION.

127
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,583
- SHE DOESN'T LOOK
ANYTHING LIKE YOU, SONSAKU.

128
00:07:03,666 --> 00:07:05,583
- REALLY?
YOU DON'T THINK SO?

129
00:07:05,666 --> 00:07:07,125
- LUCKY FOR HER.

130
00:07:09,166 --> 00:07:13,166
- En'in: WELL WELL,
SO SONSAKU HAS A LITTLE SISTER.

131
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:16,791
YOU MAY NOT HAVE THE GIANT
BOOBY-BOMBS YOUR SISTER DOES,

132
00:07:16,875 --> 00:07:19,583
BUT YOU'VE GOT PLENTY THERE
TO HAVE A SQUEEZE.

133
00:07:19,666 --> 00:07:21,666
- Man: WE GET ENOUGH?
- HMM?

134
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:23,500
- PICS.
YOU WANT MORE?

135
00:07:23,583 --> 00:07:25,625
- NAH, THAT'S GOOD.

136
00:07:25,708 --> 00:07:27,625
- FRESH MEAT,
WE'RE GONNA EAT HER ALL UP.

137
00:07:27,708 --> 00:07:29,166
JUST LIKE ALWAYS, RIGHT?

138
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:31,666
HEY!  WHAT WAS THAT FOR?

139
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:33,125
- YOU REEK.

140
00:07:33,208 --> 00:07:34,458
IT STINKS LIKE A
SWEATY GYM SOCK.

141
00:07:34,541 --> 00:07:36,416
- YOU MEAN I SMELL?

142
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:39,833
- HMM. I'LL LET YOU TASTE HER.

143
00:07:39,916 --> 00:07:43,875
BUT FIRST YOU'LL HAVE TO DO
EXACTLY WHAT I TELL YOU TO.

144
00:07:45,583 --> 00:07:47,458
HAKUFU SONSAKU.

145
00:07:47,541 --> 00:07:51,250
DON'T GO THINKING THAT YOU
CAN RULE THIS SCHOOL FOREVER.

146
00:07:55,375 --> 00:07:58,791
- ( bell ringing )

147
00:07:58,875 --> 00:08:02,916
- THAT'S REALLY WEIRD.
WHERE COULD SHE BE?

148
00:08:04,916 --> 00:08:07,250
- BIG BROTHER?

149
00:08:10,958 --> 00:08:13,041
- SORRY IT'S SO LATE TODAY.
- ( cat meows )

150
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:16,875
- BIG BROTHER KOUKIN?
- CHUUBO?

151
00:08:16,958 --> 00:08:18,541
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

152
00:08:18,625 --> 00:08:21,250
AND WHY ARE YOU
FEEDING THAT LITTLE KITTEN?

153
00:08:21,333 --> 00:08:23,916
- WELL, YOU SEE--

154
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,375
- WHAT DO WE DO, KOUKIN?!
- Koukin: WHAT DO WE DO?

155
00:08:27,458 --> 00:08:29,625
YOU'VE GONE
AND PICKED IT UP ALREADY.

156
00:08:29,708 --> 00:08:33,125
- BUT, KOUKIN,
HOW CAN WE LEAVE HIM ALONE?

157
00:08:33,208 --> 00:08:35,750
HE'S JUST
A HELPLESS TEENY-TINY KITTEN.

158
00:08:35,833 --> 00:08:38,625
- UM, WELL, I GUESS HE IS.

159
00:08:38,708 --> 00:08:41,000
- RIGHT.
SO HE'S COMING HOME WITH US.

160
00:08:41,083 --> 00:08:43,750
- HUH?  NO WAY.
I WON'T ALLOW IT.

161
00:08:43,833 --> 00:08:46,000
- WHY NOT?
- YOU'RE NOT CAPABLE

162
00:08:46,083 --> 00:08:48,250
OF TAKING CARE OF A KITTEN
ALL BY YOURSELF, HAKUFU.

163
00:08:48,333 --> 00:08:50,875
YOU CAN'T EVEN
KEEP YOUR OWN ROOM CLEAN.

164
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:53,666
- THAT HITS BELOW THE BELT.

165
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:55,791
OKAY, FINE.
I'LL KEEP HIM AT SCHOOL.

166
00:08:55,875 --> 00:08:58,416
- WELL, IN THAT CASE,
WAIT A SEC.

167
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,250
OH, NO, YOU DON'T.
- WHY NOT?

168
00:09:00,333 --> 00:09:01,541
- THEN, LET ME ASK YOU,

169
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:03,208
WILL YOU SEE THIS
ALL THE WAY THROUGH?

170
00:09:03,291 --> 00:09:05,958
CAN YOU BE RESPONSIBLE?
- YES, I CAN BE.

171
00:09:06,041 --> 00:09:08,500
- ARE YOU SURE?
- I'M SURE.

172
00:09:08,583 --> 00:09:10,000
- WILL YOU MAKE A PROMISE?

173
00:09:10,083 --> 00:09:12,375
- I PROMISE.
CROSS MY HEART.

174
00:09:15,708 --> 00:09:18,708
- AND YET,
WHERE IS HAKUFU NOW?  HMM.

175
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:20,541
- WHAT A KINDLY PERSON.

176
00:09:20,625 --> 00:09:23,125
- HUH?
- MY BIG SISTER, HAKUFU.

177
00:09:23,208 --> 00:09:25,166
NOT ONLY
IS SHE A STRONG FIGHTER,

178
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:27,708
BUT SHE HAS A SORT
OF TENDER-HEARTEDNESS.

179
00:09:27,791 --> 00:09:29,541
THAT'S WHY EVERYONE
LIKES AND RESPECTS HER

180
00:09:29,625 --> 00:09:31,250
SO MUCH AS A LEADER.

181
00:09:31,333 --> 00:09:32,583
- THEY DO?

182
00:09:32,666 --> 00:09:34,750
- SHE DIDN'T ACT BOTHERED
IN THE LEAST,

183
00:09:34,833 --> 00:09:36,500
EVEN THOUGH I SHOWED UP
ALL OF A SUDDEN

184
00:09:36,583 --> 00:09:38,416
AND BARGED INTO YOUR LIVES.

185
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:41,416
- YOU'RE NO BOTHER.
I SWEAR.

186
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:44,083
DON'T GO THINKING
THAT YOU ARE.

187
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:46,666
WE LIKE HAVING YOU
HOME WITH US, CHUUBO.

188
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:48,416
YOU'RE WELCOME TO STAY
AS LONG AS YOU WANT.

189
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:49,583
- BIG BROTHER.

190
00:09:52,583 --> 00:09:56,041
- SORRY.
- ( cat meows )

191
00:09:56,125 --> 00:09:58,291
- SORRY, KITTY.

192
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:03,083
- Hakufu: DAY AND DAY, WITH
NOTHING BUT MILK TO DRINK.

193
00:10:03,166 --> 00:10:04,583
POOR KITTY'S
GOT TO BE SICK OF IT.

194
00:10:04,666 --> 00:10:08,125
MY CAT IS GONNA EAT
AN OILY FISH!

195
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:11,375
- Man: HAVE YOU HEARD
THE LATEST

196
00:10:11,458 --> 00:10:13,125
ABOUT THE SO-CALLED LEADER
OF THE BIG FOUR?

197
00:10:13,208 --> 00:10:15,125
THEY SAY SHE'S BEEN
KEEPING A LITTLE KITTY CAT

198
00:10:15,208 --> 00:10:16,875
OUT BEHIND THE GYM.

199
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:20,083
RUMOR HAS IT SHE'S TOO STUPID
TO TALK WITH NORMAL PEOPLE,

200
00:10:20,166 --> 00:10:21,958
SO SHE TALKS
TO THE CAT INSTEAD.

201
00:10:22,041 --> 00:10:23,291
- WHAT A WEIRDO.

202
00:10:23,375 --> 00:10:24,958
IT'S BAD ENOUGH
SHE'S AN IDIOT,

203
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:28,250
BUT A CREEPY CAT-WHISPERER TOO?
IT'S LIKE SHE'S SUBHUMAN.

204
00:10:28,333 --> 00:10:32,291
- MUST BE A REAL PAIN IN THE ASS
FOR THE BIG FOUR.

205
00:10:32,375 --> 00:10:35,625
THEY'VE GOT TO DEAL WITH THAT
IDIOTIC BIMBO EVERY SINGLE DAY.

206
00:10:35,708 --> 00:10:38,208
- I'LL BET SHE DOESN'T
GIVE A CRAP ABOUT ANY OF THEM.

207
00:10:38,291 --> 00:10:40,958
TO HER,
THEY'RE JUST HUMAN SHIELDS.

208
00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:42,625
- HER, A LEADER?

209
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:45,000
THAT'S A LOAD OF BULL
I KNOW I COULDN'T SWALLOW

210
00:10:45,083 --> 00:10:48,875
EVEN IF YOU RAMMED IT
DOWN MY THROAT.

211
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:51,833
- All: THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID.
( laughing )

212
00:10:51,916 --> 00:10:53,500
- HUH?

213
00:11:00,125 --> 00:11:02,375
- WELL DONE, GENTLEMEN.

214
00:11:12,583 --> 00:11:14,250
- SONSAKU?

215
00:11:14,333 --> 00:11:16,625
- NO ONE'S SEEN HER
SINCE THIS AFTERNOON.

216
00:11:16,708 --> 00:11:19,166
- IT'S NOT THAT UNUSUAL
FOR HER TO DISAPPEAR.

217
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:21,500
- YEAH, BUT WE'VE GOT
TO GO TO WORK TODAY.

218
00:11:21,583 --> 00:11:25,166
- IT'S WORK?  OH.
- I HATE TO ASK, RYOMOU,

219
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:27,041
BUT WOULD YOU MIND
FILLING IN FOR HER?

220
00:11:27,125 --> 00:11:30,708
JUST THIS ONCE, PLEASE?
- I TOLD YOU BEFORE,

221
00:11:30,791 --> 00:11:32,458
I'M NOT RIGHT
FOR THAT TYPE OF THING.

222
00:11:32,541 --> 00:11:34,166
- COULDN'T YOU TRY IT ONCE?

223
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:36,208
THE MAID UNIFORM
IS AWFULLY PRETTY.

224
00:11:36,291 --> 00:11:37,708
IT WOULD LOOK GOOD ON YOU.

225
00:11:37,791 --> 00:11:39,916
I THINK YOU'D LIKE IT
IF YOU GAVE IT A CHANCE.

226
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,125
- I SAID NO!

227
00:11:41,208 --> 00:11:43,416
BYE, SHUYU.  LATER.

228
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:46,250
OH, I'LL SEE YOU LATER TOO,
SONKEN.

229
00:11:46,333 --> 00:11:48,291
- SURE.

230
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,416
BYE, RYOMOU.
HAVE A GOOD DAY.

231
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:56,041
BIG BROTHER,
I DON'T MEAN TO MEDDLE,

232
00:11:56,125 --> 00:11:57,916
BUT IS THERE A WAY
I COULD BE OF HELP?

233
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,875
MAYBE I COULD
TAKE BIG SISTER'S SHIFT.

234
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:02,625
- En'in:
LOOKS LIKE SHE FELL FOR IT.

235
00:12:02,708 --> 00:12:04,833
NOW FOR THE BAIT--

236
00:12:04,916 --> 00:12:07,208
SUCH YOUNG, TASTY BAIT.

237
00:12:11,958 --> 00:12:13,291
- HUH?

238
00:12:15,333 --> 00:12:17,750
- WHAT ARE YOU MOPING ABOUT?

239
00:12:17,833 --> 00:12:20,875
- AH!
MO-- MOU-CHAN.

240
00:12:23,208 --> 00:12:24,875
- ( laughs )

241
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:27,125
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU'RE MOPING FOR REAL.

242
00:12:27,208 --> 00:12:29,791
THAT'S SO NOT LIKE YOU.
IT'S HYSTERICAL.

243
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:31,750
- WHAT?
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

244
00:12:31,833 --> 00:12:33,166
IT'S NO USE, MOU-CHAN.

245
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:35,416
I KNOW YOU THINK
I'M JUST SOME SILLY DITZ

246
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:37,791
AND THAT I'M TOO STUPID TO BE
THE LEADER OF THE BIG FOUR.

247
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,250
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

248
00:12:42,333 --> 00:12:44,166
I SEE.

249
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:46,458
SO THERE ARE STILL
PATHETIC LOW LIFES AT SCHOOL

250
00:12:46,541 --> 00:12:48,708
THAT SPEW RIDICULOUS
AND CRUEL LIES.

251
00:12:48,791 --> 00:12:50,625
- THEY WEREN'T LIES.

252
00:12:50,708 --> 00:12:52,541
- YOU'RE RIGHT,
THEY WEREN'T.

253
00:12:52,625 --> 00:12:54,541
AT LEAST NOT ALL OF THEM.

254
00:12:54,625 --> 00:12:56,625
YOU ARE KINDA STUPID,
AND THAT'S A FACT.

255
00:12:56,708 --> 00:12:58,958
- MMM.

256
00:12:59,041 --> 00:13:01,125
- SONSAKU.
- YEAH?

257
00:13:01,208 --> 00:13:03,791
- WHAT'S YOUR IDEA OF WHAT
A LEADER IS SUPPOSED TO BE?

258
00:13:03,875 --> 00:13:06,458
- I DON'T THINK
I HAVE AN IDEA.

259
00:13:06,541 --> 00:13:08,375
HA!
I AM KINDA DUMB.

260
00:13:08,458 --> 00:13:11,208
- NO TWO LEADERS ARE EXACTLY THE
SAME. BUT ALL OF THEM

261
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:14,958
BEAR THE SAME RESPONSIBILITY
TO THEIR SUBJECTS,

262
00:13:15,041 --> 00:13:17,000
THE SUBJECTS WHO PUT
ALL THEIR HOPES AND DREAMS

263
00:13:17,083 --> 00:13:18,291
ON THE LEADER'S SHOULDERS.

264
00:13:18,375 --> 00:13:20,541
- YOU MEAN THEY
DEPEND ON THE LEADER?

265
00:13:20,625 --> 00:13:23,791
- THAT'S RIGHT. AND IT'S
A LEADER'S RESPONSIBILITY

266
00:13:23,875 --> 00:13:26,166
TO DO ALL SHE CAN TO PROTECT
THOSE HOPES AND DREAMS

267
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:28,583
AND SOMETIMES
EVEN HELP THEM COME TRUE.

268
00:13:28,666 --> 00:13:31,000
THAT'S WHAT
BEING A LEADER IS.

269
00:13:31,083 --> 00:13:33,166
THERE AREN'T TOO MANY PEOPLE
WHO COULD HANDLE ALL OF THAT

270
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:35,625
WITHOUT COMPLETELY FALLING APART
UNDER THE PRESSURE.

271
00:13:35,708 --> 00:13:38,291
AND YOU, SONSAKU,
ARE JUST STUPID ENOUGH

272
00:13:38,375 --> 00:13:41,250
THAT NONE OF IT GETS TO YOU.
- STOP CALLING ME STUPID.

273
00:13:41,333 --> 00:13:43,666
OH.

274
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:46,708
THANK YOU, MOU-CHAN!
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

275
00:13:46,791 --> 00:13:49,000
- I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND EVERYTHING
THAT YOU JUST TOLD ME,

276
00:13:49,083 --> 00:13:50,583
BUT IT CHEERED ME UP ANYWAY.

277
00:13:50,666 --> 00:13:53,583
THANK YOU FOR BEING SUCH
A GOOD FRIEND TO ME, MOU-CHAN.

278
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:56,458
- THEN WE ARE FRIENDS.
HMM.

279
00:13:56,541 --> 00:13:59,333
OH, I NEARLY FORGOT.
SHUYU IS LOOKING FOR YOU.

280
00:13:59,416 --> 00:14:01,958
- DID HE SAY WHY?
- SOMETHING TO DO WITH WORK.

281
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:04,375
- OH, CRAP,
I FORGOT ALL ABOUT IT!

282
00:14:04,458 --> 00:14:07,458
THANKS AGAIN, MOU-CHAN.
SEE YOU TOMORROW!

283
00:14:11,333 --> 00:14:13,000
- ( dialing )

284
00:14:13,083 --> 00:14:15,708
- GAKUSHU?  IT'S ME.

285
00:14:15,791 --> 00:14:17,916
THERE'S SOMETHING
I NEED TO ASK YOU ABOUT.

286
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,333
- ( panting )

287
00:14:21,416 --> 00:14:24,875
OH, NO, I'M SO LATE,
I'M GONNA TOTALLY MISS MY SHIFT.

288
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:26,208
HUH?

289
00:14:26,291 --> 00:14:29,083
- ( moaning )
- KOUKIN?

290
00:14:29,166 --> 00:14:31,625
KOUKIN!
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?

291
00:14:31,708 --> 00:14:34,625
- HAKUFU.  I'M SORRY
I GOT CAUGHT OFF-GUARD.

292
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:36,958
THEY TOOK HER.

293
00:14:46,291 --> 00:14:47,958
- ( laughing )

294
00:14:48,041 --> 00:14:50,875
NOW THEN,
SHOULD WE GET STARTED?

295
00:14:50,958 --> 00:14:53,333
- Koukin: WAIT, HAKUFU!

296
00:14:53,416 --> 00:14:55,125
DON'T GO.
IT'S A TRAP!

297
00:14:55,208 --> 00:14:57,375
- I HAVE TO GO IN THERE
EVEN IF IT'S A TRAP

298
00:14:57,458 --> 00:14:59,000
BECAUSE I'M THE LEADER.

299
00:14:59,083 --> 00:15:00,916
- ( cameras flashing )

300
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,708
- HUH?
WHERE AM I?

301
00:15:04,791 --> 00:15:06,916
WHAT AM I DOING HERE?

302
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,666
WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?

303
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:12,500
- BECAUSE WE'RE GONNA UPLOAD IT
STRAIGHT TO THE BOSS'S WEBSITE.

304
00:15:12,583 --> 00:15:13,958
YOU'RE GONNA BE
ALL OVER THE NET.

305
00:15:14,041 --> 00:15:15,291
- HUH?

306
00:15:15,375 --> 00:15:17,750
WHO'S THIS BOSS WITH A NET?

307
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:20,458
- HIS NAME IS EN'IN.
HE LEADS THIS GANG.

308
00:15:20,541 --> 00:15:22,208
- EN'IN WAS THE GANG'S
NUMBER-TWO FIGHTER

309
00:15:22,291 --> 00:15:24,750
UNDER THE OLD BOSS, ENJYUTSU.

310
00:15:24,833 --> 00:15:27,083
THERE WERE RUMORS
AFTER ENJYUTSU WAS KILLED

311
00:15:27,166 --> 00:15:29,166
THAT HE WAS SCHEMING
TO BECOME THEIR NEW LEADER.

312
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:35,791
- OKAY, IT LOOKS LIKE
WE'VE GOT ENOUGH SHOTS

313
00:15:35,875 --> 00:15:40,291
OF HER WITH THE UNIFORM ON.
NEXT UP, WHAT'S INSIDE.

314
00:15:40,375 --> 00:15:41,750
- En'in: THAT'S ENOUGH FOR NOW.

315
00:15:41,833 --> 00:15:44,750
- EN'IN!

316
00:15:44,833 --> 00:15:47,916
- DID I GIVE YOU PERMISSION
TO DO MORE THAN TAKE PICTURES?

317
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,583
- NO.
WE'RE SORRY, BOSS.

318
00:15:50,666 --> 00:15:53,666
- DOES THAT MEAN
YOU'RE MR. EN'IN?

319
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:56,916
- NO NEED TO BE SO FORMAL. I'D
PREFER YOU CALLED ME MASTER.

320
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:01,125
ARE YOU SCARED?

321
00:16:01,208 --> 00:16:05,250
I REALLY LIKE IT
WHEN THEY'RE SCARED.

322
00:16:05,333 --> 00:16:08,083
YOU SMELL SO DELICIOUS.

323
00:16:08,166 --> 00:16:11,125
JUST LIKE A BIG PIECE
OF WARM CHERRY PIE.

324
00:16:11,208 --> 00:16:13,583
NOW IT'S TIME FOR A TASTE.

325
00:16:13,666 --> 00:16:15,875
- ( squealing )

326
00:16:23,791 --> 00:16:27,166
- TIME FOR DESSERT.

327
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:29,833
- NO, DON'T!
PLEASE STOP!  PLEASE!

328
00:16:29,916 --> 00:16:33,208
HELP ME.
SAVE ME, PLEASE, BIG SISTER.

329
00:16:33,291 --> 00:16:35,708
BIG SISTER HAKUFU,
SAVE ME!

330
00:16:45,125 --> 00:16:48,333
- DO YOU MIND? WE WERE IN
THE MIDDLE OF SOMETHING.

331
00:16:48,416 --> 00:16:50,833
YOU CAN'T JUST BARGE IN HERE
WITHOUT AN INVITATION.

332
00:16:50,916 --> 00:16:53,041
YOU TWO
ARE BEING TERRIBLY IMPOLITE.

333
00:16:53,125 --> 00:16:55,916
- I'M THE ONE YOU'VE GOT
A BEEF WITH, NOT HER.

334
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,375
LET HER GO.
- I'M AFRAID I CAN'T DO THAT--

335
00:16:58,458 --> 00:17:00,458
NOT UNTIL YOU DO SOMETHING
FOR ME FIRST.

336
00:17:00,541 --> 00:17:01,625
- WHAT?

337
00:17:01,708 --> 00:17:04,083
- I WANT YOU TO ISSUE
AN IMPERIAL ORDER.

338
00:17:04,166 --> 00:17:06,375
- ABOUT WHAT?
- ME.

339
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:07,875
I WANT YOU TO WRITE AN ORDER

340
00:17:07,958 --> 00:17:09,916
DECLARING THAT YOU,
HAKUFU SONSAKU,

341
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,791
ARE STEPPING DOWN
AND NAMING ME, EN'IN,

342
00:17:11,875 --> 00:17:13,708
THE NEW LEADER
OF NANYO ACADEMY.

343
00:17:13,791 --> 00:17:17,666
- WHAT?
- AND IF I DON'T DO THIS?

344
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:20,791
- THEN I GUESS YOU DON'T CARE
WHAT HAPPENS TO YOUR SISTER.

345
00:17:20,875 --> 00:17:25,625
- IF YOU HARM EVEN A SINGLE HAIR
ON HER HEAD, YOU WILL PAY!

346
00:17:28,666 --> 00:17:30,708
- SUN TZU TEACHES US

347
00:17:30,791 --> 00:17:33,041
"TO BEWARE
WHEN BIRDS TAKE TO THE SKIES."

348
00:17:33,125 --> 00:17:34,625
- HUH?

349
00:17:34,708 --> 00:17:37,208
- BIRDS TAKING FLIGHT CAN OFTEN
BE EVIDENCE OF AN AMBUSH.

350
00:17:37,291 --> 00:17:39,041
GET READY, HAKUFU!

351
00:17:41,291 --> 00:17:43,750
- OF COURSE THERE'S AN AMBUSH.
DID YOU REALLY EXPECT SOMEONE

352
00:17:43,833 --> 00:17:46,125
AS INTELLIGENT AS
I AM TO FIGHT FAIR?

353
00:17:46,208 --> 00:17:48,833
IF YOU HONESTLY THOUGHT THAT I
WOULD FIGHT YOU ALL BY MYSELF,

354
00:17:48,916 --> 00:17:51,083
THEN YOU'RE AN ABSOLUTE FOOL!

355
00:17:51,166 --> 00:17:54,041
( laughs )

356
00:17:54,125 --> 00:17:55,083
- HAKUFU.

357
00:17:55,166 --> 00:17:58,458
- HE'S RIGHT, KOUKIN,
I AM A FOOL.

358
00:17:58,541 --> 00:18:01,416
I MAY EVEN BE AN IDIOT,

359
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:04,416
BUT I'M NO COWARD.
THAT'S WHAT YOU ARE!

360
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:07,958
- INSULT ME NOW,
WHILE YOU STILL CAN.

361
00:18:08,041 --> 00:18:10,208
BECAUSE ONCE MY GANG
IS DONE WITH YOU,

362
00:18:10,291 --> 00:18:12,541
YOU WON'T EVEN
BE ABLE TO TALK.

363
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:14,625
NOW, GENTLEMEN,
ATTACK HER!

364
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:25,083
WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?

365
00:18:25,166 --> 00:18:28,416
- WE'RE SORRY, BOSS!
- WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED?

366
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,708
- WHAT DOES IT LOOK
LIKE HAPPENED?

367
00:18:30,791 --> 00:18:33,416
- GAKUSHU,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

368
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:35,833
- THE BONDS THAT UNITE
THE BIG FOUR ARE STRONG.

369
00:18:35,916 --> 00:18:38,541
YOU SHOULDN'T
UNDERESTIMATE THEM.

370
00:18:38,625 --> 00:18:42,125
THERE'S NO WAY
YOU CAN WIN NOW.

371
00:18:42,208 --> 00:18:45,583
- FINE, I GIVE UP.
YOU WIN THIS ROUND.

372
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:48,250
BUT DON'T THINK YOU'RE GOING
TO GET OFF SCOT-FREE.

373
00:18:48,333 --> 00:18:51,500
VICTORY HAS ITS PRICE
AND YOU ARE ABOUT TO PAY DEARLY.

374
00:18:51,583 --> 00:18:54,125
YOU SHOULD HAVE GIVEN ME
WHAT I WANTED!

375
00:18:54,208 --> 00:18:55,833
HYAH!

376
00:18:59,791 --> 00:19:01,541
- AHH!

377
00:19:05,666 --> 00:19:08,000
- Hakufu: MOU-CHAN!

378
00:19:10,166 --> 00:19:12,458
- HE'S ALL YOURS, SONSAKU.

379
00:19:12,541 --> 00:19:14,666
- WOW, MOU-CHAN,
YOU'RE THE BEST!

380
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:16,416
MY TURN.

381
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,500
- ER, AHH, I'M SCREWED.

382
00:19:18,583 --> 00:19:21,291
- HOW DARE YOU TRY
TO HURT MY SISTER?

383
00:19:21,375 --> 00:19:23,708
YOUR ASS IS MINE NOW, BITCH!

384
00:19:23,791 --> 00:19:27,000
- ( En'in screaming )

385
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:31,500
- I'M SO SORRY THEY BEAT YOU UP,
BIG BROTHER KOUKIN.

386
00:19:31,583 --> 00:19:34,000
- DON'T WORRY, I'LL BE FINE.
I'M JUST GLAD YOU'RE SAFE.

387
00:19:34,083 --> 00:19:36,250
- AND I ALSO WANT TO
THANK BIG SISTER HAKUFU.

388
00:19:36,333 --> 00:19:37,791
THANK YOU FOR SAVING ME.

389
00:19:37,875 --> 00:19:40,166
- Koukin: THERE'S
ONE LAST THING.

390
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:41,416
- OH?

391
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:43,750
- THERE'S SOMETHING HERE
I JUST CAN'T FIGURE OUT.

392
00:19:43,833 --> 00:19:46,166
- WHAT'S THAT?
- THE FISH.

393
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:49,583
- OH NO, THAT'S THE FISH
I BOUGHT THIS AFTERNOON!

394
00:19:49,666 --> 00:19:53,291
- IT'S YOURS?
- KOUKIN!

395
00:19:53,375 --> 00:19:56,750
GIVE ME A HAND.
IT'S SO LONG AND SLIPPERY.

396
00:19:56,833 --> 00:19:58,291
- FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE,

397
00:19:58,375 --> 00:20:00,375
WHY DID YOU BUY AN OILY SALMON
IN THE FIRST PLACE?

398
00:20:00,458 --> 00:20:02,916
- ISN'T IT OBVIOUS?
IT'S FOR THE CAT.

399
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:07,291
AAH! I HAVEN'T BEEN TO CHECK
ON HIM OR FEED HIM ALL DAY.

400
00:20:07,375 --> 00:20:09,541
- I WENT AND FED HIM SOME MILK
AT LUNCHTIME.

401
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:12,000
- REALLY?
OH, THANK YOU, KOUKIN.

402
00:20:12,083 --> 00:20:14,458
- BIG SISTER HAKUFU, I HAVE
A FAVOR I WANT TO ASK YOU.

403
00:20:14,541 --> 00:20:15,833
- WHAT IS IT?

404
00:20:15,916 --> 00:20:18,000
- STARTING TOMORROW,
CAN I COME WITH YOU

405
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:20,416
WHEN YOU GO TO FEED AND
TAKE CARE OF THE LITTLE KITTEN?

406
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:22,958
- SURE YOU CAN.
COME ANYTIME.

407
00:20:23,041 --> 00:20:24,875
THAT WOULD HELP ME
A LOT, CHUUBO.

408
00:20:24,958 --> 00:20:28,458
- OH, MY GOSH, YOU JUST--
- JUST WHAT?

409
00:20:28,541 --> 00:20:30,958
- YOU CALLED ME
BY MY FIRST NAME, CHUUBO.

410
00:20:31,041 --> 00:20:34,625
YOU'VE NEVER DONE THAT BEFORE.
OH, I'M SO HAPPY!

411
00:20:34,708 --> 00:20:37,708
- OKAY THEN.

412
00:20:37,791 --> 00:20:40,083
- Gakushu: LET'S ALL GO
TO THAT LITTLE MOM AND POP SHOP

413
00:20:40,166 --> 00:20:41,750
OUT BY THE TRAIN STATION.

414
00:20:41,833 --> 00:20:44,750
- YOU REALLY LIKE THAT GREEN
TEA MOCHI SUNDAE, DON'T YOU?

415
00:20:44,833 --> 00:20:47,125
- YEAH.
- COME WITH US, MOU-CHAN.

416
00:20:47,208 --> 00:20:48,958
- I DON'T USUALLY LIKE
TO EAT SWEETS.

417
00:20:49,041 --> 00:20:50,416
BUT I SUPPOSE--

418
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:53,166
SAJI?

419
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:54,916
SORRY, I HAVE TO GO.
- WAIT.

420
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,791
- BYE.
- WHAT'S THE MATTER, MOU-CHAN?

421
00:21:01,375 --> 00:21:03,375
- ( grunts )

422
00:21:03,458 --> 00:21:05,625
THE DRAGON STIRS.

423
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:17,416
I'VE LOST HIM.

424
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:19,083
HEY!

425
00:21:21,458 --> 00:21:23,416
ARE YOU OKAY?

426
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:25,250
THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE!

427
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:33,000
IT'S HOUSEN RYOFU.

428
00:21:35,208 --> 00:21:37,458
HOW IS SHE EVEN ALIVE?

429
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,875
- ( end theme playing )

430
00:21:53,458 --> 00:21:55,833
- ( singing in Japanese )

431
00:23:17,875 --> 00:23:20,416
- Gakushu: HEY, SONSAKU?
YOU KNOW THAT LITTLE KITTEN

432
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:22,083
YOU'RE KEEPING OUT
BEHIND THE GYM?

433
00:23:22,166 --> 00:23:25,375
DO YOU THINK THAT MAYBE I COULD
COME AND PET IT SOMETIME?

434
00:23:25,458 --> 00:23:26,416
- HUH?

435
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:28,291
GAKU-CHAN, IF
YOU TRIED TO PET IT,

436
00:23:28,375 --> 00:23:30,083
THE POOR LITTLE THING
WOULD BE CRUSHED.

437
00:23:30,166 --> 00:23:31,291
NO WAY!
- COME ON.

438
00:23:31,375 --> 00:23:32,916
I PROMISE I'LL BE GENTLE.
JUST ONCE.

439
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,750
WILL YOU PLEASE LET ME PET IT
JUST ONE TIME?

440
00:23:34,833 --> 00:23:36,583
- Sonken:
GAKUSHU, PLEASE CALM DOWN.

441
00:23:36,666 --> 00:23:38,750
A FIGHTER NEEDS
TO STAY COMPOSED

442
00:23:38,833 --> 00:23:41,375
SO HE CAN BE READY FOR ANYTHING.
- NO, I WANT TO PET IT!

443
00:23:41,458 --> 00:23:43,833
I WANT TO PET THE KITTEN
RIGHT NOW.
