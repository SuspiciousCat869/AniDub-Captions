1
00:01:43,208 --> 00:01:44,833
- THIS CHICK'S STRONG.

2
00:01:44,916 --> 00:01:47,833
- WHO THE HELL ARE YOU,
YOU CRAZY BITCH?

3
00:01:47,916 --> 00:01:51,000
- SHIMEI RYOMOU
OF NANYO JUNIOR HIGH.

4
00:01:51,083 --> 00:01:53,875
- YOU'RE FROM
NANYO JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL?

5
00:01:53,958 --> 00:01:55,375
THEN GIVE ENJYUTSU THIS!

6
00:01:55,458 --> 00:01:57,708
- THAT DUMB MONKEY?

7
00:01:57,791 --> 00:02:00,041
HE DIDN'T SEND ME.
I'M FIGHTING ON MY OWN.

8
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:07,166
- ( laughs )

9
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:10,166
- ON YOUR OWN?
OF YOUR OWN FREE WILL?

10
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:13,250
THAT'S A LOAD OF BULLSHIT!
( grunts )

11
00:02:15,291 --> 00:02:18,333
- A LITTLE TOO CARELESS,
JUST LIKE ALWAYS.

12
00:02:18,416 --> 00:02:20,666
EH, MOU-CHAN?
- I'M NOT CARELESS.

13
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:22,250
- DON'T DENY IT.

14
00:02:22,333 --> 00:02:24,625
THERE'S NO NEED TO
BE SELF-CONSCIOUS.

15
00:02:24,708 --> 00:02:27,583
- I THINK IT'S CUTE.

16
00:02:27,666 --> 00:02:29,541
HERE.
YOU CAN HAVE THE REST.

17
00:02:29,625 --> 00:02:33,208
I'LL TAKE OVER FROM HERE.
CLEANING UP IS A MAN'S JOB.

18
00:02:33,291 --> 00:02:35,208
( humming )
WAIT!

19
00:02:35,291 --> 00:02:36,625
SAJI?

20
00:02:55,458 --> 00:02:57,291
- ( grunting )

21
00:03:22,083 --> 00:03:23,666
- I DIDN'T NEED YOU.

22
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:25,291
- FINE, YOU DIDN'T.

23
00:03:25,375 --> 00:03:28,125
BUT YOU'RE HAPPY TO
SEE ME ANYWAY, RIGHT?

24
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:30,833
- LET ME MAKE IT UP TO YOU.
HANG OUT WITH ME TONIGHT.

25
00:03:30,916 --> 00:03:33,166
- WHAT?

26
00:03:42,875 --> 00:03:45,375
- NEVER MIND.
FORGET ABOUT IT.

27
00:03:49,416 --> 00:03:51,666
- ( laughs )

28
00:03:55,875 --> 00:03:57,625
- Ryomou: HOUSEN RYOFU.

29
00:04:05,916 --> 00:04:08,250
IT WAS AT THAT MOMENT.

30
00:04:08,333 --> 00:04:10,541
THAT WAS THE DAY
I FIRST MET YOU.

31
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,375
ARE YOU AWAKE?

32
00:04:34,958 --> 00:04:38,416
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?
WHY HAVE YOU COME BACK?

33
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,416
- ( grunting )

34
00:04:42,625 --> 00:04:45,458
DO-- DO I KNOW YOU?

35
00:04:45,541 --> 00:04:48,166
- YOU DON'T KNOW WHO I AM?

36
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:50,083
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?

37
00:04:54,125 --> 00:04:55,541
- WHO AM I?

38
00:04:55,625 --> 00:04:56,916
- WHA--

39
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,375
- ( bell tolling )

40
00:05:01,208 --> 00:05:02,833
- YEAH!

41
00:05:05,583 --> 00:05:08,833
HA!
FIRST ONE HERE.

42
00:05:08,916 --> 00:05:11,541
- YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO RACE UP
HERE, BIG SISTER HAKUFU.

43
00:05:11,625 --> 00:05:13,125
THE BENTO'S STILL GOOD.

44
00:05:13,208 --> 00:05:15,291
- BUT YOU WOKE UP EARLY TODAY
AND WORKED SO HARD

45
00:05:15,375 --> 00:05:18,500
TO MAKE THE MOST AMAZING SPECIAL
BENTO FOR ME TO EAT FOR LUNCH.

46
00:05:18,583 --> 00:05:19,708
IT WOULD BE A
SHAME IF I COULDN'T

47
00:05:19,791 --> 00:05:21,458
EAT IT AT OUR
SPECIAL PLACE.

48
00:05:21,541 --> 00:05:23,750
- ( laughs )
IT WASN'T THAT MUCH TROUBLE.

49
00:05:23,833 --> 00:05:25,291
JUST A BENTO.

50
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:27,333
BUT IT MAKES ME HAPPY
TO KNOW THAT YOU LIKE IT.

51
00:05:27,416 --> 00:05:28,708
- IN THAT CASE,

52
00:05:28,791 --> 00:05:30,916
DO YOU THINK THAT YOU COULD
MAKE ME LUNCH EVERY DAY?

53
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,458
- OF COURSE I CAN DO THAT.

54
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:34,958
I'D GLADLY DO ANYTHING
TO HELP MY BIG SISTER.

55
00:05:35,041 --> 00:05:37,291
- ALL RIGHT!

56
00:05:37,375 --> 00:05:39,416
- BUT IT'S JUST A PACKED LUNCH.

57
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,375
NOTHING WORTH
GETTING EXCITED ABOUT.

58
00:05:41,458 --> 00:05:44,416
- BUT MOM SAYS MAKING LUNCH
IS A HASSLE.

59
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,708
SHE MAKES ME BUY IT
FROM THE CONVENIENCE STORE.

60
00:05:46,791 --> 00:05:49,208
- A-CHEW!

61
00:05:49,291 --> 00:05:52,625
IT WOULD APPEAR THAT SOMEONE IS
TALKING ABOUT ME BEHIND MY BACK.

62
00:05:52,708 --> 00:05:55,083
PERHAPS IT'S THAT GUY
FROM THE COFFEE SHOP.

63
00:05:55,166 --> 00:05:58,375
BUT THE MANAGER AT THE SUPER
MARKET IS QUITE HANDSOME TOO!

64
00:05:58,458 --> 00:05:59,416
THAT BEING SAID,

65
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,500
MUCH AS I LIKE
OGLING THE MANAGER,

66
00:06:01,583 --> 00:06:04,125
I HOPE CHUUBO DOESN'T KEEP
MAKING THOSE GIANT BENTOS.

67
00:06:04,208 --> 00:06:05,750
I DON'T THINK WE CAN AFFORD IT.

68
00:06:08,375 --> 00:06:10,916
- OKAY.
THANK YOU FOR THE FOOD.

69
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,208
- ( crow squawking )

70
00:06:13,291 --> 00:06:15,541
CAW!

71
00:06:20,541 --> 00:06:22,625
- GIVE BACK THE MOST
AMAZING SPECIAL BENTO

72
00:06:22,708 --> 00:06:25,916
CHUUBO MADE FOR ME!
COME BACK, YOU STUPID CROW.

73
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,916
WHEN I CATCH YOU, I'M GONNA
PULL OUT ALL YOUR FEATHERS!

74
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,291
- ARE YOU SURE BIG SISTER HAKUFU
WILL BE ALL RIGHT?

75
00:06:30,375 --> 00:06:33,458
- HONESTLY, I'M MORE WORRIED
ABOUT THE CROW THAN HAKUFU.

76
00:06:33,541 --> 00:06:36,000
- SHE'S ALWAYS SO FULL
OF ENERGY, ISN'T SHE?

77
00:06:36,083 --> 00:06:37,458
- MR. GAKUSHU.

78
00:06:37,541 --> 00:06:40,291
HOW NICE TO SEE YOU.
IS MISS RYOMOU COMING?

79
00:06:40,375 --> 00:06:42,541
- I DON'T THINK SO.
SHE DIDN'T SHOW UP TODAY.

80
00:06:42,625 --> 00:06:44,041
- Both: HUH?

81
00:06:44,125 --> 00:06:46,916
- SORRY, I HAVE TO GO.
BYE.

82
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,875
- WAIT.
WHAT'S THE MATTER, MOU-CHAN?

83
00:06:48,958 --> 00:06:50,750
- SHE JUST RAN OFF.

84
00:06:50,833 --> 00:06:53,083
I HOPE THAT NOTHING BAD
HAPPENED.

85
00:06:53,166 --> 00:06:56,083
- YOU'VE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME!
YOU'RE HOSEN RYOFU.

86
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:58,166
THERE'S NO ONE ELSE
YOU COULD POSSIBLY BE.

87
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:01,541
- HOSEN RYOFU.
IS THAT MY NAME?

88
00:07:01,625 --> 00:07:03,500
- I DON'T BUY IT.

89
00:07:03,583 --> 00:07:07,166
HOW COULD YOU
NOT REMEMBER ANYTHING?

90
00:07:10,583 --> 00:07:13,000
HAVE YOU ALSO FORGOTTEN
THAT YOU'RE A FIGHTER?

91
00:07:13,083 --> 00:07:15,916
- A FIGHTER?
WHAT IS THAT?

92
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,333
- THIS IS A SACRED BEAD,
THE MAGATAMA.

93
00:07:19,416 --> 00:07:21,708
YOU HAVE ONE JUST LIKE IT.

94
00:07:23,958 --> 00:07:26,708
IT'S PROOF
THAT SOMEONE IS A FIGHTER.

95
00:07:26,791 --> 00:07:28,875
- THIS PROVES I'M A FIGHTER?

96
00:07:28,958 --> 00:07:32,875
- BUT BACK THEN,
THAT WASN'T ALL YOU WERE.

97
00:07:36,083 --> 00:07:38,875
SAJI IS LATE.
SHOULD WE WAIT FOR HIM?

98
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:40,541
- ( grunts )

99
00:07:45,416 --> 00:07:47,000
- SAJI IS NOT HERE.

100
00:07:47,083 --> 00:07:49,791
RIGHT NOW I'M THE ONE
WHO IS YOUR OPPONENT.

101
00:07:51,458 --> 00:07:52,708
- ( grunting )

102
00:07:52,791 --> 00:07:54,708
- YOU SHOULD BE GRATEFUL
YOU'RE FIGHTING ME

103
00:07:54,791 --> 00:07:56,708
AND NOT THE YOUNG MASTER.

104
00:07:56,791 --> 00:07:59,708
I MAY BE STRONG,
BUT HE IS 10 TIMES STRONGER.

105
00:07:59,791 --> 00:08:02,166
- ( door closes )

106
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:06,208
- SAJI CAN'T REALLY BE
MUCH STRONGER THAN THAT GUY,

107
00:08:06,291 --> 00:08:08,875
CAN HE?
WHERE IS HE ANYWAY?

108
00:08:08,958 --> 00:08:12,250
THIS PLACE IS SO HUGE, THOUGH.
LIKE A MANSION.

109
00:08:12,333 --> 00:08:14,250
IS IT POSSIBLE HE GOT LOST
IN HIS OWN HOUSE?

110
00:08:14,333 --> 00:08:16,708
( gasps )

111
00:08:30,041 --> 00:08:32,833
- Housen: YOU CAN COME OUT NOW.

112
00:08:35,666 --> 00:08:37,458
JEALOUS, ARE WE?

113
00:08:42,791 --> 00:08:45,083
THERE'S REALLY NO NEED TO BE.

114
00:08:45,166 --> 00:08:48,041
I HAVE NO SPECIAL PLACE
IN SAJI'S AFFECTIONS.

115
00:08:48,125 --> 00:08:50,416
I'M JUST A PLAYTHING FOR HIM.
- WHAT?

116
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,000
- IT'S A GAME.

117
00:08:52,083 --> 00:08:54,083
HE'S JUST GETTING CLOSE TO ME
SO THAT HE CAN GET THE CHANCE

118
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:56,625
TO DEFEAT TOUTAKU,
LEADER OF RAKUYA.

119
00:08:56,708 --> 00:08:58,333
JUST THE MEANS TO AN END.

120
00:08:58,416 --> 00:09:01,083
BUT YOU'RE JUST A CHILD,
MOU-CHAN.

121
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:03,291
YOU CAN'T UNDERSTAND
ADULT RELATIONSHIPS LIKE THIS.

122
00:09:03,375 --> 00:09:05,791
- YOU BITCH!

123
00:09:05,875 --> 00:09:08,625
- ( coughing )
- HEY, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

124
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
RYOFU,
YOU'RE COUGHING UP BLOOD.

125
00:09:14,083 --> 00:09:17,625
- PLEASE, LISTEN TO ME,
RYOMOU.

126
00:09:17,708 --> 00:09:19,291
PROMISE ME--

127
00:09:19,375 --> 00:09:22,041
PROMISE YOU'LL DO SOMETHING
FOR ME.

128
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:27,791
- YOU ASKED ME FOR A FAVOR.

129
00:09:27,875 --> 00:09:31,333
BUT LATER ON, YOU DIED.
- ( gasps )

130
00:09:35,416 --> 00:09:36,958
- I WAS THERE.

131
00:09:37,041 --> 00:09:40,250
I WATCHED YOU FIGHT YOUR LAST
DEADLY BATTLE WITH TOUTAKU.

132
00:09:40,333 --> 00:09:42,708
YOU USED UP EVERY BIT OF YOUR
STRENGTH TO TRY AND DEFEAT HIM.

133
00:09:51,583 --> 00:09:55,416
- IF I DIED,
THEN WHO AM I NOW?

134
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:58,750
- ( cell phone ringing )

135
00:10:03,583 --> 00:10:05,833
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

136
00:10:09,916 --> 00:10:11,750
- Gakushu: THAT'S A FINE
HOW-DO-YA-DO

137
00:10:11,833 --> 00:10:14,291
AFTER I'VE BEEN SO WORRIED.
WHAT'S UP?  WHERE ARE YOU?

138
00:10:14,375 --> 00:10:15,791
- THAT'S NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS.

139
00:10:15,875 --> 00:10:17,833
- COME ON, RYOMOU, IT'S ME.
- ( door closing )

140
00:10:20,875 --> 00:10:22,208
- DAMN.

141
00:10:24,708 --> 00:10:27,000
- RYOMOU, TALK TO ME.

142
00:10:27,083 --> 00:10:29,500
IS SOMETHING WRONG?

143
00:10:29,583 --> 00:10:32,041
CAN YOU HEAR ME, RYOMOU?
- ( phone beeps off )

144
00:10:34,583 --> 00:10:38,416
- WHERE ARE YOU?
WHY AREN'T YOU HERE?

145
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:40,500
WHY IS IT THAT YOU
ALWAYS SEEM TO DISAPPEAR

146
00:10:40,583 --> 00:10:43,375
JUST WHEN I NEED YOU THE MOST?

147
00:10:43,458 --> 00:10:45,500
( sighs ) SAJI.

148
00:11:22,791 --> 00:11:25,708
YOU ASKED ME FOR A FAVOR.

149
00:11:25,791 --> 00:11:28,416
BUT LATER ON YOU DIED.

150
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:31,166
- SHE CAN'T BE RIGHT
BECAUSE THAT MEANS...

151
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:32,916
I'M DEAD.

152
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,125
- Hakufu: COME BACK HERE,
YOU LITTLE BASTARD!

153
00:11:36,208 --> 00:11:37,875
- CAW!

154
00:11:37,958 --> 00:11:39,875
- AWW, YOU STUPID CROW!

155
00:11:39,958 --> 00:11:43,041
STOP TAUNTING ME.
GIVE ME BACK MY BENTO!

156
00:11:43,125 --> 00:11:44,958
YOU'RE JUST MAKING FUN OF ME,
AREN'T YOU?

157
00:11:45,041 --> 00:11:47,250
WELL, I'M NOT GONNA
LET YOU GET AWAY WITH THAT!

158
00:11:47,333 --> 00:11:48,375
HA!

159
00:11:52,041 --> 00:11:55,375
- A SACRED BEAD.
SHE'S ALSO A FIGHTER.

160
00:11:55,458 --> 00:11:57,666
- CAW CAW!

161
00:12:12,583 --> 00:12:16,583
- WHOA!  OH OH OH!

162
00:12:16,666 --> 00:12:18,416
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

163
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:22,166
LUCKY FOR ME YOU WERE HERE.
THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT LUNCH.

164
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:26,833
- ( growling )
- WAS THAT YOUR TUMMY GROWLING?

165
00:12:26,916 --> 00:12:29,375
WHY DON'T YOU
EAT LUNCH WITH ME?

166
00:12:33,083 --> 00:12:35,000
- I CAN'T IMAGINE NOT
BEING ABLE TO REMEMBER

167
00:12:35,083 --> 00:12:36,166
ANYTHING ABOUT YOURSELF.

168
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:38,750
I DIDN'T THINK
THAT WAS POSSIBLE.

169
00:12:38,833 --> 00:12:40,541
THEN AGAIN, I FORGET
ALL KINDS OF THINGS

170
00:12:40,625 --> 00:12:42,416
ALMOST AS SOON AS I LEARN THEM.

171
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:45,125
I CAN'T REMEMBER
PEOPLE'S FACES OR NAMES.

172
00:12:45,208 --> 00:12:47,500
NO MATTER HOW HARD I TRY,
THEY DON'T STICK.

173
00:12:47,583 --> 00:12:50,041
KOUKIN SCOLDS ME, BUT HE TRIES
TO HELP ME REMEMBER.

174
00:12:50,125 --> 00:12:52,541
OH, I KNOW!
I AM A LITTLE STUPID.

175
00:12:52,625 --> 00:12:54,041
MAYBE THAT'S THE
REASON I'M FORGETTING

176
00:12:54,125 --> 00:12:56,833
THINGS ALL OF THE TIME.

177
00:12:56,916 --> 00:13:00,833
( laughs )
YOU FINALLY SMILED.

178
00:13:00,916 --> 00:13:03,125
YOU LOOKED SO DEPRESSED.
I WAS A WORRIED.

179
00:13:03,208 --> 00:13:05,625
BUT THEN IT MIGHT BE HARD
TO SMILE IF YOU'RE HUNGRY.

180
00:13:05,708 --> 00:13:08,708
HERE, PLEASE EAT ALL YOU WANT.
IT'S JUST US GIRLS AROUND,

181
00:13:08,791 --> 00:13:10,791
SO WE CAN GO AHEAD
AND STUFF OURSELVES.

182
00:13:10,875 --> 00:13:12,541
MAMA SAYS IT'S NOT LADY-LIKE
TO SCARF DOWN MY

183
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:14,333
FOOD IN MIXED COMPANY.

184
00:13:14,416 --> 00:13:16,958
- ( laughs )

185
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,666
DELICIOUS.

186
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:32,208
THANK YOU
FOR SHARING YOUR FOOD.

187
00:13:32,291 --> 00:13:34,500
- THAT HIT THE SPOT.
I'M STUFFED.

188
00:13:34,583 --> 00:13:37,416
- Sonken: BIG SISTER HAKUFU!
- Koukin: HAKUFU!

189
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,625
- GREAT.
NOW KOUKIN AND CHUUBO ARE HERE.

190
00:13:39,708 --> 00:13:41,750
- WE WERE LOOKING
ALL OVER THE PLACE FOR YOU.

191
00:13:41,833 --> 00:13:44,208
- OH!
THE BENTO I MADE FOR YOU.

192
00:13:44,291 --> 00:13:46,833
YOU ATE THE ENTIRE THING!
THAT'S SO WONDERFUL.

193
00:13:46,916 --> 00:13:49,041
DID YOU LIKE ALL OF IT?
- YOU BET.

194
00:13:49,125 --> 00:13:50,833
AND THIS GIRL HERE
HELPED ME EAT IT.

195
00:13:50,916 --> 00:13:52,375
SO IT WAS JUST THE RIGHT AMOUNT.

196
00:13:52,458 --> 00:13:55,000
- IS SHE A FRIEND?
I DON'T BELIEVE WE'VE MET.

197
00:13:55,083 --> 00:13:57,791
- OH. WELL, WE MET AND BECAME
FRIENDS JUST NOW IN THE PARK.

198
00:13:57,875 --> 00:13:59,750
- WE'RE FRIENDS NOW?

199
00:13:59,833 --> 00:14:03,166
- BY THE WAY, I FORGOT
TO ASK YOU WHAT YOUR NAME IS.

200
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:05,250
WHAT'S WRONG, KOUKIN?

201
00:14:05,333 --> 00:14:07,708
- I KNOW THAT UNIFORM.
IT'S RAKUYO.

202
00:14:09,833 --> 00:14:11,416
AND YOU'RE A FIGHTER.

203
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:13,916
THAT MUST MEAN
YOU'RE HOUSEN RYOFU.

204
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,750
BUT WHAT AM I SAYING?
THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

205
00:14:17,833 --> 00:14:19,250
HOUSEN RYOFU IS LONG GONE.

206
00:14:19,333 --> 00:14:21,750
SHE DIED IN A BATTLE
WITH TOUTAKU.

207
00:14:21,833 --> 00:14:23,375
- WHAT'S THE MATTER?

208
00:14:23,458 --> 00:14:26,291
- IT'S TRUE THEN.
I REALLY AM A FIGHTER?

209
00:14:26,375 --> 00:14:28,958
- SHE DOESN'T REMEMBER THAT.

210
00:14:29,041 --> 00:14:30,916
SHE DOESN'T REMEMBER
ANYTHING ABOUT HERSELF.

211
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,500
- NO, I DON'T.

212
00:14:33,583 --> 00:14:35,625
- YOU'RE HOUSEN RYOFU!

213
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:37,791
THERE'S NO ONE ELSE
YOU COULD POSSIBLY BE.

214
00:14:37,875 --> 00:14:39,583
- THERE'S NO MISTAKE.

215
00:14:39,666 --> 00:14:42,125
APPARENTLY,
I AM THE FIGHTER HOUSEN RYOFU.

216
00:14:42,208 --> 00:14:44,625
AND I'M SUPPOSED TO BE DEAD.

217
00:14:44,708 --> 00:14:46,958
- Sonken: SUN TZU TEACHES,

218
00:14:47,041 --> 00:14:50,458
"A KINGDOM ONCE DESTROYED
CAN NEVER RETURN TO BEING,

219
00:14:50,541 --> 00:14:53,250
NOR CAN THE DEAD EVER
BE BROUGHT BACK TO THE LIVING.

220
00:14:53,333 --> 00:14:56,166
ONCE A COUNTRY IS DESTROYED,

221
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:59,500
THAT COUNTRY AS IT WAS
NO LONGER EXISTS.

222
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:02,125
THEY MAY REBUILD ITSELF,
BUT IT'S NOT THE SAME.

223
00:15:02,208 --> 00:15:05,666
SO WHEN A PERSON DIES, THAT SAME
PERSON CAN NEVER COME BACK."

224
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:08,833
YOUR PRESENCE HERE
PROVES YOU'RE ALIVE.

225
00:15:08,916 --> 00:15:11,916
YOU ARE ONLY YOURSELF.
THE PERSON YOU ARE RIGHT NOW.

226
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,833
- SO I'M HERE
AND THAT PROVES THAT I'M ALIVE?

227
00:15:14,916 --> 00:15:16,333
- THAT'S RIGHT, FU-CHIN!

228
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:18,500
YOU'RE NOT DEAD AND NO ONE
CAN CLAIM THAT YOU ARE.

229
00:15:18,583 --> 00:15:20,750
SO BE HAPPY.
LET'S GO!

230
00:15:20,833 --> 00:15:23,583
- BIG SISTER, WAIT!
- WHERE ARE YOU GOING, HAKUFU?

231
00:15:23,666 --> 00:15:25,208
- THE CLINIC.

232
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:27,875
I WANT DOCTOR KADA
TO HAVE A LOOK AT HER.

233
00:15:30,375 --> 00:15:31,833
- ( banging )

234
00:15:31,916 --> 00:15:35,166
- WHAT HAPPENED?
OWWIE.

235
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:37,750
- ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
- ( gasps )

236
00:15:37,833 --> 00:15:40,666
- KARAOKE.
HALF OFF TODAY!

237
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:43,833
- HAKUFU, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

238
00:15:43,916 --> 00:15:46,916
- TIME FOR A CHANGE OF PLANS.
WE'RE ALL GOING TO KARAOKE.

239
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,166
- WELL, WE'RE SO LATE,

240
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:49,916
WE MIGHT AS WELL
JUST SKIP CLASS AND--

241
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,583
HEY, WAIT JUST A MINUTE HERE!

242
00:15:51,666 --> 00:15:54,208
- BUT IT'S A SPECIAL SALE
JUST FOR TODAY.

243
00:15:54,291 --> 00:15:56,125
EVERYTHING IS HALF OFF.

244
00:15:56,208 --> 00:15:58,291
THAT MEANS WE CAN ALL SING
TWICE AS MANY SONGS.

245
00:15:58,375 --> 00:15:59,625
- AND THE CLINIC?

246
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:01,500
YOU WANTED RYOFU
TO GO GET CHECKED OUT.

247
00:16:01,583 --> 00:16:03,041
- WE CAN DO THAT LATER.

248
00:16:03,125 --> 00:16:06,083
SINGING MIGHT HELP JOG
SOMETHING IN FU-CHIN'S MEMORY.

249
00:16:06,166 --> 00:16:07,583
PLEASE, CAN WE GO?

250
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:10,458
- HMM.
WHAT DO YOU THINK, CHUUBO?

251
00:16:10,541 --> 00:16:12,666
- THAT DEPENDS, BIG BROTHER.

252
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:15,583
CAN YOU EXPLAIN TO ME
WHAT KARAOKE IS FIRST?

253
00:16:15,666 --> 00:16:16,958
- All: WHAT?

254
00:16:19,583 --> 00:16:22,916
- NO LUCK.
WHERE'D SHE GO TO?

255
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,708
- Woman:
YOU ARE LOOKING FOR SOMEONE?

256
00:16:24,791 --> 00:16:28,250
- FORTUNE TELLER?
I HAVE NO MONEY.

257
00:16:28,333 --> 00:16:30,416
AND EVEN IF I DID,
I DON'T BELIEVE IN GOD

258
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:32,458
AND ESPECIALLY NOT IN PSYCHICS
OR FORTUNE TELLERS.

259
00:16:32,541 --> 00:16:35,916
- THE INDIVIDUAL YOU SEEK
IS LOCATED SOUTHEAST OF HERE.

260
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,208
SHE ISN'T ALL THAT FAR
FROM THIS VERY SPOT.

261
00:16:38,291 --> 00:16:39,875
- WHAT?

262
00:16:41,916 --> 00:16:44,083
SHE'S SOMEWHERE
SOUTHEAST OF HERE?

263
00:16:44,166 --> 00:16:47,250
- LISTEN FOR HER SONG
AND FOLLOW THE SOUND.

264
00:16:47,333 --> 00:16:49,750
- THERE'S NO WAY.
SHE CAN'T BE.

00:19:46,041 --> 00:19:48,833
- ( grunting )

312
00:19:52,083 --> 00:19:54,500
- YOU WILL NEED
TO BECOME STRONGER.

313
00:19:54,583 --> 00:19:57,375
IF YOU REMAIN A WEAKLING,
I WON'T BE ABLE TO COUNT ON YOU.

314
00:19:57,458 --> 00:19:59,166
- COUNT ON ME?
TO DO WHAT?

315
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:02,541
- TO TAKE CARE OF SAJI.
- WHAT?

316
00:20:02,625 --> 00:20:06,458
- TIME IS SHORT
AND I AM RUNNING OUT OF IT.

317
00:20:06,541 --> 00:20:08,583
THERE'S STILL MORE TO DO
TO CHANGE HISTORY.

318
00:20:08,666 --> 00:20:09,916
- IMPOSSIBLE.

319
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,458
YOU CAN'T CONTINUE FIGHTING
IN YOUR CONDITION.

320
00:20:12,541 --> 00:20:14,458
- WHY NOT?
- YOU'RE DYING!

321
00:20:14,541 --> 00:20:17,166
- SUCH IS THE DESTINY
OF A FIGHTER.

322
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:19,791
NO, THAT'S NOT QUITE RIGHT.

323
00:20:19,875 --> 00:20:23,125
THE SACRED BEADS LOCK US
INTO A HISTORY WE MUST REPEAT.

324
00:20:23,208 --> 00:20:25,875
BUT I FOUGHT AGAINST IT,
AND THOUGH IT COST ME DEARLY,

325
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:28,125
I SUCCEEDED.

326
00:20:28,208 --> 00:20:30,875
THAT'S RIGHT.
I CHANGED MY FATE.

327
00:20:30,958 --> 00:20:32,875
MY DEATH IS MY CHOICE.

328
00:20:32,958 --> 00:20:35,083
- YOU CHANGED YOUR FATE?

329
00:20:35,166 --> 00:20:39,000
- I'M COUNTING ON YOU NOW.
TAKE CARE OF SAJI.

330
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:54,125
- ( all gasp )

331
00:20:54,208 --> 00:20:56,000
- IT'S MOU-CHAN.

332
00:21:02,083 --> 00:21:03,333
- HUH?

333
00:21:12,375 --> 00:21:13,958
- WOW!

334
00:21:14,041 --> 00:21:17,750
MOU-CHAN AND FU-CHIN ARE FRIENDS
ALREADY. THAT'S AWESOME!

335
00:21:17,833 --> 00:21:20,333
- YOU LEFT THIS WORLD
TOO SOON, RYOFU.

336
00:21:20,416 --> 00:21:23,708
GOD HAS BROUGHT YOU BACK
AND GIVEN YOU MORE TIME TO LIVE.

337
00:21:23,791 --> 00:21:27,166
- GOD GAVE ME MORE TIME?

338
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:28,583
- YES.

339
00:21:28,666 --> 00:21:31,041
AND YOU CAN DO ANYTHING
YOU WANT TO WITH IT.

340
00:21:31,125 --> 00:21:32,583
YOUR LIFE IS YOUR CHOICE.

341
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,916
- ( end theme playing )

342
00:21:53,291 --> 00:21:55,708
- ( singing in Japanese )

343
00:23:17,458 --> 00:23:19,416
- Hakufu:
WOW, I SURE SANG A LOT TODAY.

344
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:21,750
AND KOUKIN AND CHUUBO'S DUET
WAS SO CUTE.

345
00:23:21,833 --> 00:23:24,750
THEY LOOKED ABSOLUTELY ADORABLE,
THE PERFECT COUPLE.

346
00:23:24,833 --> 00:23:27,375
- Sonken:
UH, UH, BIG SISTER HAKUFU?

347
00:23:27,458 --> 00:23:28,791
WHAT ARE YOU GETTING AT?

348
00:23:28,875 --> 00:23:30,083
- Koukin: YEAH,
HAKUFU, WHAT GIVES?

349
00:23:30,166 --> 00:23:32,750
CHUUBO AND I DON'T LOOK
LIKE ANYTHING AT ALL.

350
00:23:32,833 --> 00:23:34,750
- Hakufu: HUH?
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU TWO?

351
00:23:34,833 --> 00:23:36,916
WHY ARE YOU TWO STARING
AT EACH OTHER?

352
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
OH, NOW YOU CLAM UP?

353
00:23:39,083 --> 00:23:41,500
HMM.
THIS IS SUSPICIOUS.

354
00:23:41,583 --> 00:23:43,750
VERY SUSPICIOUS.
