1
00:01:43,583 --> 00:01:45,791
- Housen: AREN'T YOU
COMING, RYOMOU?

2
00:01:47,875 --> 00:01:50,333
- I'M A LITTLE TIRED.
- OH, TOO BAD.

3
00:01:56,375 --> 00:01:58,291
- ( Ryomou's voice )
RYOFU'S CHANGED EVER SINCE

4
00:01:58,375 --> 00:02:00,500
WE GOT BACK
FROM RAKUYOU.

5
00:02:00,583 --> 00:02:02,500
I DON'T KNOW WHAT,

6
00:02:02,583 --> 00:02:04,458
BUT SOMETHING HAPPENED
THAT DAY.

7
00:02:20,958 --> 00:02:23,208
- ( giggles )
OVER HERE.

8
00:02:24,625 --> 00:02:27,208
- MISS RYOFU.

9
00:02:27,291 --> 00:02:28,916
WERE YOU WAITING
TOO LONG?

10
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,500
- NO, I ONLY
JUST GOT HERE.

11
00:02:30,583 --> 00:02:32,041
- OH, THANK GOODNESS.
TO BE HONEST,

12
00:02:32,125 --> 00:02:34,416
I NEVER EXPECTED YOU
TO INVITE ME OUT ANYWHERE.

13
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,583
BY THE WAY,
I DIDN'T REALLY GET A CHANCE

14
00:02:36,666 --> 00:02:39,166
TO THANK YOU PROPERLY FOR
SAVING ME AT THE BEACH BEFORE.

15
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:41,166
- YOU DON'T NEED
TO THANK ME.

16
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:43,625
WE REALLY DIDN'T GET A CHANCE
TO TALK AT ALL THEN.

17
00:02:43,708 --> 00:02:44,875
BUT I WANTED TO.

18
00:02:44,958 --> 00:02:47,250
- TO TALK TO ME?

19
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:49,625
- OH, WAS THAT
TOO FORWARD?

20
00:02:49,708 --> 00:02:51,625
- OH, NO, NOT AT ALL.

21
00:02:51,708 --> 00:02:53,208
IT MAKES ME HAPPY.

22
00:02:56,625 --> 00:02:58,125
- WAS I IMAGINING?

23
00:02:58,208 --> 00:03:00,125
- YOU FEELING
BETTER TOO, KAN'U?

24
00:03:00,208 --> 00:03:02,000
- HUH?  YES.

25
00:03:02,083 --> 00:03:04,166
WHY ISN'T RYOMOU
WITH YOU?

26
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:07,000
- OH, SHE'S NOT FEELING
TOO WELL.

27
00:03:07,083 --> 00:03:09,250
SHE MIGHT HAVE CAUGHT
A COLD OR SOMETHING.

28
00:03:09,333 --> 00:03:11,250
- OH.
- SO SHE ACTUALLY GETS SICK?

29
00:03:11,333 --> 00:03:12,458
- YEAH.

30
00:03:12,541 --> 00:03:14,291
- BUT EITHER WAY,
IT STILL ISN'T GOOD.

31
00:03:14,375 --> 00:03:17,375
- WELL, YOU KNOW, THIS IS RYOMOU
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT.

32
00:03:17,458 --> 00:03:19,208
I'M SURE
SHE'LL BE ALL RIGHT.

33
00:03:19,291 --> 00:03:20,791
- THIS GIRL...
- ( laughing )

34
00:03:20,875 --> 00:03:22,791
- SHE'S COMPLETELY DIFFERENT
FROM THE GIRL I MET

35
00:03:22,875 --> 00:03:24,791
THAT DAY AT THE BEACH.

36
00:03:33,083 --> 00:03:34,958
- I REALLY AM SORRY,
MISS RYOMOU.  AND YOU EVEN CAME

37
00:03:35,041 --> 00:03:36,708
ALL THIS WAY TOO.
- NO, IT'S FINE.

38
00:03:36,791 --> 00:03:39,208
- MAMA,
DON'T SEND HER HOME

39
00:03:39,291 --> 00:03:41,333
IF SHE CAME ALL THE WAY HERE
TO HANG OUT WITH ME.

40
00:03:41,416 --> 00:03:43,541
YOU'RE GONNA LET ME GO OUT
WITH HER, AREN'T YOU?

41
00:03:43,625 --> 00:03:46,458
- OH MY, YOU STILL HAVEN'T
THE FAINTEST CLUE

42
00:03:46,541 --> 00:03:48,583
WHY I'M MAKING YOU
CLEAN EVERYTHING, DO YOU?

43
00:03:48,666 --> 00:03:50,458
YOU STUPID LITTLE GIRL.

44
00:03:50,541 --> 00:03:52,250
- BUT I DO UNDERSTAND.

45
00:03:52,333 --> 00:03:55,458
AND I SWEAR I DEEPLY REGRET
FROM THE BOTTOM OF MY HEART

46
00:03:55,541 --> 00:03:58,000
THAT I-- LET'S SEE,
WHAT DID I DO AGAIN?

47
00:03:58,083 --> 00:04:00,166
- AFTER YOU'D MET UP WITH
WITH TON-CHAN EARLIER,

48
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:02,500
YOU DIDN'T EVEN HAVE
THE COURTESY OF HAVING HIM

49
00:04:02,583 --> 00:04:04,625
COME HERE TO VISIT ME!

50
00:04:04,708 --> 00:04:06,333
- OH, THAT'S RIGHT.

51
00:04:06,416 --> 00:04:08,583
IN THAT CASE, I'M GONNA WORK
MY FINGERS TO THE BONE

52
00:04:08,666 --> 00:04:10,250
UNTIL THE FLOOR SHINES
LIKE DIAMONDS.

53
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:11,916
- THAT'S BETTER.
AND WHILE YOU'RE AT IT,

54
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,541
DON'T FORGET TO WATER
THE LAWN, OKAY?

55
00:04:13,625 --> 00:04:15,333
- ROGER THAT.

56
00:04:15,416 --> 00:04:18,666
I THINK I'LL BE A WHILE,
MOU-CHAN, SORRY.

57
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:21,125
- HUH?  OH, WHEN DID
RYOMOU GET HERE?

58
00:04:21,208 --> 00:04:23,041
- ( crash )
- ( both exclaim )

59
00:04:23,125 --> 00:04:25,583
- OW.

60
00:04:25,666 --> 00:04:27,625
- WHAT WHAT DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE DOING, HAKUFU?

61
00:04:27,708 --> 00:04:30,458
- WHAT WAS ALL THAT NOISE?
OH.

62
00:04:30,541 --> 00:04:32,875
- HEY, COME ON, HAKUFU,
GET OFF ME.

63
00:04:32,958 --> 00:04:35,041
- YOU SHOULD HURRY UP,
BIG SISTER HAKUFU.

64
00:04:35,125 --> 00:04:37,333
BIG BROTHER LOOKS LIKE
HE'S IN A GREAT DEAL OF PAIN.

65
00:04:37,416 --> 00:04:39,041
( screams )

66
00:04:39,125 --> 00:04:43,041
- ( all exclaim )

67
00:04:43,125 --> 00:04:45,208
- I'M-- I'M VERY SORRY,
BIG BROTHER.

68
00:04:45,291 --> 00:04:47,208
- HIS NOSE
IS BLEEDING AGAIN.

69
00:04:47,291 --> 00:04:49,458
- ( Koukin groans )

70
00:04:49,541 --> 00:04:51,083
- ( sighs )

71
00:04:54,375 --> 00:04:56,916
- HEY, KAN'U.
( giggling )

72
00:05:02,583 --> 00:05:05,000
OH, MY.
- ISN'T THIS FUN, RYUUBI?

73
00:05:05,083 --> 00:05:06,916
- IT IS.

74
00:05:13,333 --> 00:05:15,625
- RYUUBI, MAKE SURE YOU HOLD ON
NICE AND TIGHT.

75
00:05:15,708 --> 00:05:18,583
- OKAY.
- ( both giggling )

76
00:05:26,458 --> 00:05:27,791
- KAN'U!

77
00:05:46,833 --> 00:05:48,458
YUMMY.

78
00:05:48,541 --> 00:05:50,625
- HOLD ON THERE.
LOOK AT ME.

79
00:05:52,583 --> 00:05:55,208
- MISS RYOFU, CUT IT OUT.
THAT TICKLES.

80
00:05:55,291 --> 00:05:57,083
- YOU'RE SUCH
A LITTLE KID.

81
00:06:03,458 --> 00:06:06,166
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?
YOU LOOK SCARY.

82
00:06:07,791 --> 00:06:08,833
HERE.

83
00:06:10,458 --> 00:06:12,833
YOU JEALOUS OF MY RELATIONSHIP
WITH RYUUBI?

84
00:06:16,083 --> 00:06:17,958
- KAN'U.

85
00:06:18,041 --> 00:06:20,291
WHY WOULD YOU
DO THAT TO HER?

86
00:06:20,375 --> 00:06:21,750
- SCARY.

87
00:06:21,833 --> 00:06:24,458
- YOU BITCH, WHAT IS IT YOU WANT
FROM OUR LEADER?

88
00:06:24,541 --> 00:06:26,208
- WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

89
00:06:26,291 --> 00:06:28,583
- STAY AWAY FROM GENTOKU.

90
00:06:28,666 --> 00:06:31,291
- PLEASE STOP IT.
- HOUSEN RYOFU,

91
00:06:31,375 --> 00:06:33,458
I TOLD YOU TO GET AWAY
FROM GENTOKU.

92
00:06:33,541 --> 00:06:36,125
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE
GETTING SO WORKED UP ABOUT.

93
00:06:36,208 --> 00:06:37,958
YOU'RE ACTING SO WEIRD.

94
00:06:38,041 --> 00:06:40,375
- WHAT'S THAT?
- KAN'U,

95
00:06:40,458 --> 00:06:42,500
PLEASE PUT A STOP TO THIS
RIGHT NOW.

96
00:06:42,583 --> 00:06:44,833
WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO DO?
- PROTECT YOU.

97
00:06:44,916 --> 00:06:47,333
MY ONE AND ONLY MISSION
IS TO KEEP YOU SAFE.

98
00:06:47,416 --> 00:06:49,708
- WELL, STOP.
I'M NOT A HELPLESS CHILD.

99
00:07:04,166 --> 00:07:05,916
WHENEVER I'M AROUND YOU,

100
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,583
I FEEL SO STIFLED.

101
00:07:08,666 --> 00:07:10,375
I CAN'T TAKE IT.

102
00:07:19,958 --> 00:07:21,541
- I'M SORRY.

103
00:07:24,625 --> 00:07:26,083
- RYUUBI.

104
00:07:28,375 --> 00:07:30,291
- LET'S GO, MISS RYOFU.

105
00:07:34,625 --> 00:07:36,208
- GENTOKU.

106
00:07:43,125 --> 00:07:45,291
- ( upbeat music playing )

107
00:07:51,083 --> 00:07:52,875
- Girl: WHAT'S THAT?
ARE YOU TELLING ME

108
00:07:52,958 --> 00:07:54,833
HE WENT CRAWLING BACK
TO HIS EX?

109
00:07:54,916 --> 00:07:56,208
- Girl #2: THAT'S WHAT
I HEARD.

110
00:07:56,291 --> 00:07:57,958
- REALLY?
AND HIS CURRENT GIRL?

111
00:07:58,041 --> 00:07:59,958
- HE'D NEVER TELL HER,
OF COURSE.

112
00:08:00,041 --> 00:08:01,500
HE'S JUST
KEEPING HER AROUND.

113
00:08:01,583 --> 00:08:04,208
- THAT'S TERRIBLE.
BUT SHE'LL CATCH HIM, WON'T SHE?

114
00:08:04,291 --> 00:08:06,583
- NOT A CHANCE.
SHE'S REALLY NAIVE.

115
00:08:06,666 --> 00:08:09,416
I GUESS LOVE REALLY IS BLIND.
WHO FALLS FOR THAT?

116
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:11,666
- PEOPLE WHO FALL IN LOVE
SURE ARE IDIOTS.

117
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:13,958
- ( both laugh )
- ( dishes clatter )

118
00:08:14,041 --> 00:08:15,625
- ( girls gasp )

119
00:08:29,166 --> 00:08:30,500
- WHAT'S WRONG?

120
00:08:30,583 --> 00:08:34,291
- I THINK--
WAS I A LITTLE TOO HARSH?

121
00:08:34,375 --> 00:08:37,625
NOW THAT I THINK ABOUT IT,
KAN'U HAS ALWAYS BEEN THERE,

122
00:08:37,708 --> 00:08:39,500
MAKING SURE I WASN'T
GETTING HURT BY ANYONE--

123
00:08:39,583 --> 00:08:41,500
- SAY, DO YOU WANT
TO GO IN THERE?

124
00:08:41,583 --> 00:08:42,625
- HUH?

125
00:08:50,833 --> 00:08:53,541
SORRY, I'M NOT ONE
FOR SCARY THINGS.

126
00:08:53,625 --> 00:08:55,583
- IF WE GO TOGETHER,
THEN YOU'LL BE FINE.

127
00:08:55,666 --> 00:08:58,458
OR IS IT THAT YOU DON'T WANT
TO BE WITH ME?

128
00:08:58,541 --> 00:09:01,291
- OH, NO, THAT'S NOT IT
AT ALL, I SWEAR.

129
00:09:01,375 --> 00:09:03,583
- THEN LET'S GO.
- OKAY.

130
00:09:06,041 --> 00:09:07,791
- ( growling )

131
00:09:07,875 --> 00:09:09,666
- ( screaming )
- ( giggling )

132
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:13,083
- ( evil cackling )

133
00:09:13,166 --> 00:09:14,541
- ( wood creaks )

134
00:09:14,625 --> 00:09:17,833
- I'M GOING TO FALL.
I'M GOING TO FALL, MISS RYOFU.

135
00:09:17,916 --> 00:09:20,750
- I TOLD YOU
IT'LL BE ALL RIGHT.

136
00:09:20,833 --> 00:09:24,166
- I'M REALLY SCARED--
LIKE, REALLY SCARED.

137
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:25,666
- DON'T WORRY.
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

138
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:27,291
REMEMBER, I'M RIGHT HERE
WITH YOU.

139
00:09:27,375 --> 00:09:29,500
- ( Ryuubi screaming )

140
00:09:32,041 --> 00:09:33,625
OKAY, I'M FINISHED.

141
00:09:33,708 --> 00:09:35,666
I DON'T THINK
I CAN GO ON ANYMORE.

142
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:37,166
- YES, DON'T WORRY.

143
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:39,416
YOU JUST STAY CLOSE TO ME.

144
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:41,833
- ( laughing )
- ( screaming )

145
00:09:41,916 --> 00:09:44,250
- ( growling )

146
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:46,625
- ( laughing )

147
00:09:48,541 --> 00:09:51,791
- OKAY, I'M DONE NOW.
WHERE'S EXIT?

148
00:09:51,875 --> 00:09:54,333
HUH?  RYOFU?

149
00:09:54,416 --> 00:09:56,041
- HELLO THERE.

150
00:09:58,458 --> 00:09:59,708
- DON'T YOU LISTEN?

151
00:09:59,791 --> 00:10:01,916
I TOLD YOU ALL YOU NEED TO DO
IS STICK WITH ME.

152
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,375
- MISS RYOFU.

153
00:10:20,083 --> 00:10:21,875
- ( bell rings )
- Monkey: NOW DEPARTING.

154
00:10:28,291 --> 00:10:29,666
- ( sighs )

155
00:10:38,208 --> 00:10:40,250
SHE LEFT HER BOOK HERE,

156
00:10:41,833 --> 00:10:43,458
IT'S AN AMUSEMENT PARK.

157
00:10:43,541 --> 00:10:45,541
I DON'T THINK
YOU'LL NEED A BOOK.

158
00:10:45,625 --> 00:10:47,708
- BUT NO MATTER
WHERE I GO,

159
00:10:47,791 --> 00:10:49,875
I ALWAYS MAKE SURE I HAVE
MY FAVORITE BOOK WITH ME.

160
00:10:49,958 --> 00:10:52,125
- SO THAT'S HOW IT IS?

161
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,083
- MISS RYOFU, WHY ON EARTH
DID YOU DO THAT TO ME?

162
00:11:10,166 --> 00:11:13,666
( screams )

163
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:16,333
( whining )

164
00:11:16,416 --> 00:11:20,083
MISS RYOFU,
CAN YOU HELP ME?

165
00:11:20,166 --> 00:11:21,375
- ( chuckles )

166
00:11:21,458 --> 00:11:23,333
I DON'T THINK
YOU NEED TO WORRY.

167
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:25,041
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

168
00:11:25,125 --> 00:11:27,875
- I'M JUST GONNA
MAKE YOU FEEL GOOD.

169
00:11:34,791 --> 00:11:37,291
- Red Hood:
PLACE HOSEN RYOFU THERE.

170
00:11:37,375 --> 00:11:39,166
- WHAT DO YOU PLAN
TO DO?

171
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:41,041
- RIGHT THERE.

172
00:12:27,083 --> 00:12:29,375
( whimpering )

173
00:12:40,041 --> 00:12:42,583
- ( Ryuubi moaning )

174
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:55,125
NO!

175
00:12:55,208 --> 00:12:57,041
- ( chuckles )

176
00:12:57,125 --> 00:12:59,875
RYUUBI GENTOKU,

177
00:12:59,958 --> 00:13:02,750
YOU'RE ALL MINE,
NOW AND FOREVER.

178
00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:07,166
- I'M ALL YOURS,
NOW AND FOREVER.

179
00:13:26,416 --> 00:13:29,166
- IT WAS ONLY NATURAL RYOFU
WOULD DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

180
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:31,375
OF COURSE
SHE'D CONTACT SAJI.

181
00:13:31,458 --> 00:13:34,916
I'M THE IDIOT.  I DIDN'T EVEN
THINK OF THE POSSIBILITY.

182
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,083
NO.

183
00:13:39,166 --> 00:13:42,083
IT'S NOT THAT
I DIDN'T THINK OF IT.

184
00:13:42,166 --> 00:13:44,375
IT'S THAT I DIDN'T WANT
TO THINK OF IT.

185
00:13:51,375 --> 00:13:52,791
- ( girl giggles )

186
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:02,083
- KAN'U.
HUH?

187
00:14:04,041 --> 00:14:05,875
- G-- GENTOKU.

188
00:14:05,958 --> 00:14:08,083
- I'M VERY SORRY
ABOUT EARLIER.

189
00:14:08,166 --> 00:14:10,416
- NO, I'M SORRY.
I DIDN'T MEAN TO CROWD YOU.

190
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,041
I APOLOGIZE.

191
00:14:12,125 --> 00:14:14,625
- PLEASE DON'T.  IT REALLY ISN'T
YOUR FAULT, KAN'U.

192
00:14:14,708 --> 00:14:16,458
THERE'S NO NEED
TO APOLOGIZE.

193
00:14:16,541 --> 00:14:19,000
- GENTOKU,

194
00:14:19,083 --> 00:14:20,916
WHERE'S RYOFU?

195
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,583
- SOMETHING CAME UP
SUDDENLY.

196
00:14:22,666 --> 00:14:25,125
- I SEE.
THEN SHALL WE GET GOING?

197
00:14:25,208 --> 00:14:27,000
- YES.

198
00:14:27,083 --> 00:14:29,125
- I WAS READING THIS.
HERE YOU GO.

199
00:14:29,208 --> 00:14:31,250
- I THOUGHT SO.

200
00:14:31,333 --> 00:14:33,375
WERE YOU CRYING JUST NOW
WHEN I WALKED UP?

201
00:14:33,458 --> 00:14:35,458
- YES.  IT'S A GOOD BOOK.

202
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:38,125
- SINCE YOU LIKED IT SO MUCH
THAT IT MADE YOU CRY,

203
00:14:38,208 --> 00:14:40,250
WHY DON'T YOU JUST KEEP IT?
- HUH?

204
00:14:40,333 --> 00:14:42,875
- I'VE GOTTEN TIRED
OF READING IT ALREADY.

205
00:14:48,708 --> 00:14:50,791
OKAY, SHALL WE GO?

206
00:14:50,875 --> 00:14:52,125
- OH.

207
00:14:53,875 --> 00:14:55,791
- HURRY UP, KAN'U.

208
00:14:55,875 --> 00:14:57,416
- OH, RIGHT.

209
00:14:59,541 --> 00:15:00,666
- ( female voice )
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

210
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:02,291
WE HOPE YOU WILL COME BACK
AGAIN SOON.

211
00:15:03,833 --> 00:15:05,041
- RYO--

212
00:15:22,291 --> 00:15:24,000
- SO IS THIS
GOOD ENOUGH FOR YOU?

213
00:15:24,083 --> 00:15:25,125
- YES.

214
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:28,375
I WANT TO MAKE SURE
RYOMOU SEES.

215
00:15:32,083 --> 00:15:34,041
- ( crying )

216
00:15:36,583 --> 00:15:39,041
- Girl: ARE YOU TELLING ME
HE WENT CRAWLING BACK TO HIS EX?

217
00:15:56,875 --> 00:15:59,166
- WHY ON EARTH
AM I FOLLOWING THEM?

218
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:00,833
( grunting )

219
00:16:02,833 --> 00:16:05,333
THE DRAGON--
IT'S THROBBING.

220
00:16:05,416 --> 00:16:08,333
- ARE YOU FEELING OKAY?

221
00:16:08,416 --> 00:16:10,208
- YES.

222
00:16:13,833 --> 00:16:16,875
- THE INDIVIDUAL YOU SEEK
IS LOCATED SOUTHEAST OF HERE.

223
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:19,583
SHE ISN'T ALL THAT FAR
FROM THIS VERY SPOT.

224
00:16:19,666 --> 00:16:21,041
- I REMEMBER HER.

225
00:16:21,125 --> 00:16:22,541
- WHAT IS IT?

226
00:16:37,916 --> 00:16:39,291
- DAMN.

227
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:43,791
- Koukin: THERE WE GO.
IT'S FINALLY DONE.

228
00:16:46,125 --> 00:16:49,250
I'M SORRY.
- I-- I APOLOGIZE AS WELL.

229
00:16:50,958 --> 00:16:52,541
- CHUBO.

230
00:16:52,625 --> 00:16:55,208
- WHAT IS IT,
BIG BROTHER KOUKIN?

231
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:00,625
- HMM?
AH, SWEET YOUTH.

232
00:17:01,791 --> 00:17:03,833
- STOP IT!
COME BACK TO ME,

233
00:17:03,916 --> 00:17:06,791
YOU NO-GOOD,
STUPID HOSE.

234
00:17:06,875 --> 00:17:08,166
- THAT HAKUFU--

235
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:10,291
SHE WENT AND RUINED
ALL THE SHOJI SCREENS,

236
00:17:10,375 --> 00:17:12,666
AND RIGHT AFTER WE FINISHED
FIXING THEM UP.

237
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:15,958
- I GUESS WE'LL JUST HAVE TO
START ALL OVER AGAIN, WON'T WE?

238
00:17:18,208 --> 00:17:20,458
- OH, NO, NOT AGAIN.

239
00:17:20,541 --> 00:17:22,500
- BIG BROTHER,
IS SOMETHING WRONG WITH YOU?

240
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:24,916
YOUR FACE LOOKS
REALLY BRIGHT RED.

241
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,791
MAYBE YOU HAVE
A BAD FEVER.

242
00:17:26,875 --> 00:17:28,500
- WHAT'S WRONG, KOUKIN?

243
00:17:28,583 --> 00:17:30,958
- I CAN'T TAKE ANY MORE.

244
00:17:31,041 --> 00:17:34,125
- HAKUFU, IT LOOKS LIKE
I'M FRESH OUT OF SOY SAUCE,

245
00:17:34,208 --> 00:17:36,750
SALT AND PEPPER.
COULD YOU BUY SOME FOR ME?

246
00:17:36,833 --> 00:17:40,666
- WHAT?  ARE YOU STILL GONNA
BOSS ME AROUND AFTER ALL I DID?

247
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:42,625
- DID YOU SAY
SOMETHING?

248
00:17:42,708 --> 00:17:44,500
- NOTHING.
NOTHING AT ALL.

249
00:17:44,583 --> 00:17:47,500
YOU USUALLY DON'T RUN OUT
OF SALT, SOY SAUCE

250
00:17:47,583 --> 00:17:49,625
AND PEPPER ALL AT THE SAME TIME,
DO YOU?

251
00:17:49,708 --> 00:17:51,125
SHE LOVES
TORTURING ME.

252
00:17:51,208 --> 00:17:52,833
- WOULD YOU LIKE ME
TO GO WITH YOU?

253
00:17:52,916 --> 00:17:54,541
- I'M NOT GETTING
ANY YOUNGER.

254
00:17:54,625 --> 00:17:58,333
- YEAH, YEAH, I HEARD YOU
ALREADY, YOU OLD HAG.

255
00:17:58,416 --> 00:18:01,916
- HAKUFU, HOW MUCH DO YOU VALUE
YOUR LIFE RIGHT NOW?

256
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:06,166
- I'M GOING NOW!

257
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:07,791
- OH.

258
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:20,500
- Ryofu: RYOMOU.

259
00:18:21,625 --> 00:18:24,458
AREN'T YOU IN A BIT
OF A DAZE?

260
00:18:24,541 --> 00:18:26,750
YOU REALLY SHOULD HAVE TRIED
TO COME WITH US, YOU KNOW.

261
00:18:28,416 --> 00:18:31,333
THE AMUSEMENT PARK
WAS A WHOLE LOT OF FUN.

262
00:18:31,416 --> 00:18:32,458
OH.

263
00:18:33,583 --> 00:18:35,333
WHAT'S WRONG?

264
00:18:35,416 --> 00:18:37,750
STILL NOT FEELING WELL?

265
00:18:37,833 --> 00:18:40,416
- I DON'T WANT TO TALK TO YOU
RIGHT NOW.

266
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:41,833
- HUH?

267
00:18:41,916 --> 00:18:44,291
WHY DON'T WANT
TO TALK TO ME?

268
00:18:44,375 --> 00:18:46,250
DID SOMETHING HAPPEN?
- SHUT UP!

269
00:18:52,416 --> 00:18:53,791
- ( chuckles )

270
00:18:57,375 --> 00:18:58,833
- ( grunting )

271
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:06,291
NOT GOOD.
I PUSHED TOO FAR.

272
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,416
- SHE'S STUPID,
THAT ROTTEN OLD HAG.

273
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,875
HOLD ON.
NOW I COMPLETELY FORGOT

274
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:21,875
EVERYTHING SHE TOLD ME
TO BUY.

275
00:19:21,958 --> 00:19:23,166
HUH?

276
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:28,625
- ( grunting, panting )

277
00:19:39,416 --> 00:19:41,625
- HEY, WATCH WHERE
YOU'RE GOING, GIRLIE.

278
00:19:51,958 --> 00:19:53,666
- ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

279
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:55,875
- THAT'S NONE
OF YOUR BUSINESS.

280
00:19:55,958 --> 00:19:57,625
LEAVE ME ALONE.

281
00:20:14,208 --> 00:20:16,458
- AND NOW
ALL WE HAVE TO DO

282
00:20:16,541 --> 00:20:18,541
IS WAIT FOR HAKUFU,
AND WE'RE SET.

283
00:20:18,625 --> 00:20:20,375
- I'M BACK.
- HUH?

284
00:20:20,458 --> 00:20:22,416
GOOD WORK, HAKUFU.

285
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:24,750
THAT WAS ACTUALLY
PRETTY FAST.

286
00:20:27,458 --> 00:20:28,750
- HANG ON.

287
00:20:28,833 --> 00:20:31,375
I'M GONNA BE RIGHT BACK
WITH SOME WATER.

288
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:37,208
MOM, I NEED WATER!

289
00:20:37,291 --> 00:20:40,333
- WHAT'S WRONG, HAKUFU?
- HAKUFU?

290
00:20:40,416 --> 00:20:42,791
- YOU SHOULD HAVE TOLD ME ABOUT
HER WHEN YOU FIRST CAME IN.

291
00:20:42,875 --> 00:20:44,500
- YEAH, BUT I THOUGHT
IT'D BE BEST

292
00:20:44,583 --> 00:20:46,125
TO MAKE HER HER
LIE DOWN FIRST.

293
00:20:46,208 --> 00:20:47,875
- HUH?
- HMM?

294
00:20:52,458 --> 00:20:54,333
WHAT?

295
00:20:54,416 --> 00:20:56,458
- HAKUFU!

296
00:20:56,541 --> 00:20:59,000
DO YOU REALLY HATE
RUNNING ERRANDS SO MUCH

297
00:20:59,083 --> 00:21:02,833
THAT YOU'D STOOP SO LOW
TO MAKE SOMETHING LIKE THIS UP?

298
00:21:02,916 --> 00:21:05,958
- NO WAY, MOM.  SHE REALLY
WAS HERE A SECOND AGO.

299
00:21:06,041 --> 00:21:08,250
- NO EXCUSES!
- ( objects crashing )

300
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:10,583
- MOM, PLEASE BELIEVE ME.

301
00:21:20,708 --> 00:21:22,750
- ( snoring softly )

302
00:21:46,875 --> 00:21:49,041
- ( theme music playing )

303
00:22:08,791 --> 00:22:11,125
( singing in Japanese )

304
00:23:17,708 --> 00:23:19,833
- Sonken:
BY THE WAY, MOTHER,

305
00:23:19,916 --> 00:23:22,541
DO YOU MIND IF I ASK YOU HOW
YOU FIRST MET MY FATHER?

306
00:23:22,625 --> 00:23:24,583
IT'S SOMETHING I WONDERED
ABOUT SINCE MEETING YOU.

307
00:23:24,666 --> 00:23:26,541
- Goei: WELL, IT WAS
A COLD WINTER NIGHT.

308
00:23:26,625 --> 00:23:28,583
I WAS A STUNNING
17-YEAR-OLD.

309
00:23:28,666 --> 00:23:31,500
I WAS IN THE MIDDLE OF BEING
ATTACKED BY SOME WILD FIGHTERS,

310
00:23:31,583 --> 00:23:33,666
WHEN YOUR FATHER SUDDENLY
APPEARED OUT OF THE BLUE

311
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:35,750
AND SAVED ME.
I ALWAYS REMEMBER

312
00:23:35,833 --> 00:23:38,041
HOW HANDSOME AND DASHING
HE LOOKED AT THAT MOMENT,

313
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:41,166
- Hakufu: WAIT, AREN'T YOU
TELLING PEOPLE YOU'RE 17 NOW?

314
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:44,208
- Goei: I'M SORRY, HAKUFU,
DID YOU SAY SOMETHING?
