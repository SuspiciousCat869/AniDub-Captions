1
00:01:38,833 --> 00:01:41,250
- IT'S BEEN A WHILE, MOU-CHAN.

2
00:01:41,333 --> 00:01:42,541
- SAJI.

3
00:01:42,625 --> 00:01:46,208
- MMM.
AND WHAT HAVE WE HERE?

4
00:01:46,291 --> 00:01:49,041
- BASTARD.
CAN'T YOU SEE RYOFU IS ALIVE?

5
00:01:49,125 --> 00:01:51,416
HOW CAN YOU BE
SO NONCHALANT ABOUT IT?

6
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:53,708
- IS THAT HOW I SEEM?

7
00:01:55,875 --> 00:01:57,208
- I'M MAD AT YOU.

8
00:01:57,291 --> 00:02:00,416
YOU WENT AND DISAPPEARED
INTO THIN AIR ONCE AGAIN.

9
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:03,750
WHERE DID YOU RUN OFF TO, SAJI?
- ( Housen moans )

10
00:02:03,833 --> 00:02:06,541
- OH, YEAH.
- PERVERT!

11
00:02:06,625 --> 00:02:09,083
WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU?
- DEFINITELY.

12
00:02:09,166 --> 00:02:11,958
THIS IS HOUSEN RYOFU'S RACK.
- STOP IT NOW!

13
00:02:14,583 --> 00:02:16,333
- ( both grunt )

14
00:02:16,416 --> 00:02:18,583
- JEALOUS, ARE WE?

15
00:02:18,666 --> 00:02:20,166
- NO, I'M NOT.

16
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:23,750
- ( cellphone plays tune )
- HUH?

17
00:02:26,333 --> 00:02:29,791
- EXCUSE ME.

18
00:02:29,875 --> 00:02:31,625
YEAH, I'M HERE.

19
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:37,333
( humming )
- Housen: THAT SONG.

20
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:49,958
- ( both gasp )

21
00:02:50,041 --> 00:02:51,958
- WHERE'D HE GO?

22
00:02:55,166 --> 00:02:56,208
DAMN.

23
00:02:56,291 --> 00:03:00,000
SAJI.  WHY?

24
00:03:06,208 --> 00:03:09,541
- RYOMOU?
- WHAT IS IT?

25
00:03:09,625 --> 00:03:11,750
- THAT MAN,
YOU CALLED HIM SAJI?

26
00:03:11,833 --> 00:03:14,125
WHO WAS HE AND WHY DID
HE TOUCH ME LIKE THAT?

27
00:03:14,208 --> 00:03:15,666
- TOUCH YOU LIKE WHAT?

28
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:19,625
- ON MY BREASTS.

29
00:03:19,708 --> 00:03:21,625
- I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT.

30
00:03:21,708 --> 00:03:25,458
- DID HE DO THAT BECAUSE HE WAS
SOMEBODY THAT I WAS CLOSE TO?

31
00:03:33,041 --> 00:03:36,833
- THAT MAN--
HE ISN'T GENPOU SAJI.

32
00:03:36,916 --> 00:03:39,666
THAT'S AN ALIAS HE GOES BY.
- HMM?

33
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:42,833
- HE'S HID HIS REAL NAME
FOR A LONG TIME.

34
00:03:42,916 --> 00:03:45,958
IT'S SHISHI OUIN.
- WHO WAS HE TO ME?

35
00:03:46,041 --> 00:03:49,875
- BACK BEFORE
YOU LOST YOUR MEMORY,

36
00:03:49,958 --> 00:03:52,125
THE TWO OF YOU WERE--
- WAIT, RYOMOU.

37
00:03:52,208 --> 00:03:55,208
JUST DON'T. I DON'T
WANT YOU TO TALK ABOUT

38
00:03:55,291 --> 00:03:56,750
SOMETHING THAT
YOU DON'T WANT TO.

39
00:03:56,833 --> 00:03:59,500
- NO, THAT'S NOT IT.
I CAN TELL YOU.

40
00:03:59,583 --> 00:04:02,291
- IT SEEMS PAINFUL FOR YOU.
I DON'T WANT THAT.

41
00:04:04,375 --> 00:04:05,791
- ALL RIGHT.

42
00:04:05,875 --> 00:04:08,000
- ( whistle blows )

43
00:04:24,416 --> 00:04:26,791
- Hakufu: YAY!

44
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:32,416
WE'RE AT THE BEACH!

45
00:04:33,541 --> 00:04:37,250
- HAKUFU.
- HMM?

46
00:04:37,333 --> 00:04:39,250
- WE DIDN'T COME HERE TODAY
TO HAVE FUN.

47
00:04:39,333 --> 00:04:41,833
- HAVE YOU FORGOTTEN,
BIG SISTER?

48
00:04:41,916 --> 00:04:44,250
- ( moaning )

49
00:04:44,333 --> 00:04:47,958
BUT THE OCEAN IS CALLING ME!
- NO, IT IS NOT.

50
00:04:52,666 --> 00:04:54,916
- SO YOU ALL UNDERSTAND
YOUR JOBS?

51
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,625
- YES!
- WE SHALL FULFILL OUR DUTIES.

52
00:04:57,708 --> 00:04:59,625
- MAN, THIS SUCKS.

53
00:05:05,833 --> 00:05:08,541
- POPSICLES.
POPSICLES, ANYONE?

54
00:05:08,625 --> 00:05:10,083
- Woman:
WE'LL TAKE TWO, PLEASE.

55
00:05:10,166 --> 00:05:12,250
- AH, GREAT!

56
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,583
- HI.

57
00:05:15,666 --> 00:05:19,625
- YOU'RE FROM AROUND HERE.
IS THIS YOUR SUMMER JOB?

58
00:05:19,708 --> 00:05:22,958
- FEELING HOT?
- YOU'RE KIND OF A CUTE ONE.

59
00:05:23,041 --> 00:05:25,791
- HEY CUTIE,
WANNA COME PLAY AFTER WORK?

60
00:05:25,875 --> 00:05:29,458
- POPSICLES
ARE GOING TO MELT.

61
00:05:29,541 --> 00:05:32,083
- RAMEN SPECIAL, ORDER UP!

62
00:05:32,166 --> 00:05:36,916
- THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
I WILL DELIVER IT PROMPTLY.

63
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,875
- THAT GIRL'S TOO PROPER.
THROWS ME OFF MY GAME.

64
00:05:43,125 --> 00:05:45,958
- ( both chuckling )

65
00:05:48,125 --> 00:05:51,833
- ( moaning )

66
00:05:57,208 --> 00:05:59,291
IT'S TOO HOT.

67
00:05:59,375 --> 00:06:01,458
I DON'T DESERVE THIS.

68
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:13,833
AS YOU CAN SEE,
I'VE BEEN PERFECTLY ROASTED.

69
00:06:13,916 --> 00:06:15,500
THAT'S IT!

70
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:17,333
I'M AT THE BEACH!

71
00:06:17,416 --> 00:06:20,625
I'M NOT ABOUT TO GET COOKED
WITH THE REST OF THE VEGETABLES.

72
00:06:20,708 --> 00:06:22,416
- ( plates crashing,
Sonken screaming )

73
00:06:24,458 --> 00:06:27,083
- WHAT'RE YOU GOING TO DO
ABOUT THIS MESS YOU LITTLE--

74
00:06:27,166 --> 00:06:28,583
HUH?

75
00:06:28,666 --> 00:06:31,708
- ( whimpering )

76
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:33,041
STOP YOUR WHIMPERIN'.

77
00:06:33,125 --> 00:06:35,166
DO YOU KNOW
WHO THE TWO OF US ARE?

78
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:38,541
WE RULE THIS BEACH.
AND THAT DEMANDS A CERTAIN RES--

79
00:06:41,583 --> 00:06:43,958
- ( chuckles )
BULL'S-EYE.

80
00:06:44,041 --> 00:06:45,875
- BIG SISTER!

81
00:06:45,958 --> 00:06:48,875
I'M SORRY. I DON'T KNOW
EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED.

82
00:06:48,958 --> 00:06:52,750
BUT THAT MAN--
HE PINCHED ME.

83
00:06:52,833 --> 00:06:55,541
AHH!
- ( man laughs )

84
00:06:55,625 --> 00:06:57,833
- I'M SO EMBARRASSED
I COULD DIE.

85
00:06:57,916 --> 00:06:59,875
- SO I BRUSHED HER ASS.

86
00:06:59,958 --> 00:07:01,916
JUST A LITTLE FEELSKI.
NO HARM DONE.

87
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,833
- THAT'S SEXUAL HARASSMENT.

88
00:07:03,916 --> 00:07:07,125
- I FEEL VIOLATED.
HELP ME, BIG SISTER.

89
00:07:07,208 --> 00:07:09,083
- Man: HMM?

90
00:07:09,166 --> 00:07:12,208
YOU TWO DON'T LOOK
THAT MUCH LIKE SISTERS.

91
00:07:12,291 --> 00:07:15,875
THOUGH YOU'RE DEFINITELY
NOT THAT BAD.

92
00:07:15,958 --> 00:07:18,708
AS HER BIG SISTER,
YOU'RE RESPONSIBLE.

93
00:07:18,791 --> 00:07:21,291
I THINK YOU OWE ME
FOR LITTLE SISTER'S MESS.

94
00:07:21,375 --> 00:07:23,666
- YOU OWE ME. YOU'RE
THE ONE WHO WENT

95
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:26,625
AND GROPED MY PRECIOUS
LITTLE SISTER'S BEHIND.

96
00:07:26,708 --> 00:07:30,000
I THINK YOU NEED A
LESSON IN MANNERS.

97
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:33,625
- ( all gasping )

98
00:07:33,708 --> 00:07:34,958
- HUH?

99
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:40,708
SHE DIDN'T.

100
00:07:40,791 --> 00:07:43,250
- Hakufu: KOUKIN!

101
00:07:43,333 --> 00:07:44,916
HI.

102
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,625
( laughs nervously )

103
00:07:47,708 --> 00:07:49,625
OWWIE!

104
00:07:51,416 --> 00:07:54,250
I'M FREE.

105
00:07:54,333 --> 00:07:56,541
- ( laughs nervously )

106
00:07:56,625 --> 00:08:00,458
ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR.
TWO, TWO, THREE, FOUR.

107
00:08:00,541 --> 00:08:03,041
WHAT'S WRONG
WITH YOU TWO GLOOMY GUSSES?

108
00:08:03,125 --> 00:08:05,250
WE'RE FREE NOW.
WE CAN GO SWIMMING.

109
00:08:05,333 --> 00:08:07,416
- BUT NOW
WE DON'T HAVE JOBS ANYMORE,

110
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,041
THANKS TO A CERTAIN SOMEONE.

111
00:08:09,125 --> 00:08:11,958
SHEESH!
ONE OF THESE DAYS, HAKUFU.

112
00:08:12,041 --> 00:08:16,458
- UH?  BIG BROTHER?
I DON'T THINK SHE HEARD YOU.

113
00:08:16,541 --> 00:08:17,833
- HUH?

114
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:23,250
- YAY!
( laughing )

115
00:08:25,208 --> 00:08:26,458
- OH, HAKUFU.

116
00:08:26,541 --> 00:08:29,875
- THE WATER'S GREAT!

117
00:08:29,958 --> 00:08:33,333
- BEST DAY EVER!

118
00:08:33,416 --> 00:08:36,083
- Hakufu: PERFECT.

119
00:08:36,166 --> 00:08:38,791
- HOW MANLY!
- SEXY.

120
00:08:38,875 --> 00:08:40,833
- OH MY!
- CRAB-TASTIC.

121
00:08:40,916 --> 00:08:43,166
- KOUKIN, YOUR HEAD
IS STICKING OUT!

122
00:08:46,541 --> 00:08:49,166
( sighs )

123
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:51,166
- ( stomach growls )

124
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:54,125
I'M SO HUNGRY.

125
00:08:54,208 --> 00:08:56,958
- I FEEL JUST AWFUL. IF I
HAD PREPARED A BENTO,

126
00:08:57,041 --> 00:08:59,083
WE WOULD HAVE HAD
SOMETHING TO EAT.

127
00:08:59,166 --> 00:09:01,416
I'M SORRY.
THIS IS ALL MY FAULT.

128
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:02,625
- HUH?

129
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:03,958
- DON'T PUT THE BLAME
ON YOURSELF, CHUUBO.

130
00:09:04,041 --> 00:09:06,291
THE JOB WAS SUPPOSED
TO COME WITH FREE MEALS.

131
00:09:06,375 --> 00:09:08,416
THAT'S WHY WE PACKED LIGHT
AND ONLY BROUGHT ENOUGH MONEY

132
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,125
FOR THE TRAIN FAIRE HOME.

133
00:09:10,208 --> 00:09:13,250
- WHAT?!
YOU MEAN WE'VE GOT NO CASH?

134
00:09:13,333 --> 00:09:15,666
- YUP.
- SO HUNGRY.

135
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:17,333
- Man over P.A.:
IT'S TIME TO ANNOUNCE THE WINNER

136
00:09:17,416 --> 00:09:20,291
OF THE PERFECT TAN CONTEST.

137
00:09:22,375 --> 00:09:25,333
THIS YEAR'S
BEST TAN BELONGS TO...

138
00:09:25,416 --> 00:09:27,541
CONTESTANT #9!

139
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:31,875
UNCHO KAN'U!

140
00:09:31,958 --> 00:09:36,166
GIVE IT UP
FOR YOUR BRONZE QUEEN!

141
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:38,916
- YAY!
I KNEW KAN'U WOULD WIN IT.

142
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,541
- GENTOKU.

143
00:09:40,625 --> 00:09:43,375
SHE LOOKS SO HAPPY.

144
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:44,875
I'M GLAD I ENTERED.

145
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:46,875
- Ekitoku:
CHECK OUT THIS CONTEST, KAN'U!

146
00:09:46,958 --> 00:09:49,708
IT'S LIKE IT WAS TAILOR-MADE
FOR YOU. YOU COULD WIN IT.

147
00:09:49,791 --> 00:09:52,041
- NOT INTERESTED.
- UM, EKITOKU?

148
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:54,625
IS IT OKAY IF I ASK YOU
A QUESTION ABOUT SOMETHING?

149
00:09:54,708 --> 00:09:55,958
- SURE, ASK AWAY.

150
00:09:56,041 --> 00:09:59,583
- HOW COME YOU'RE WEARING
YOUR SCHOOL SWIMSUIT?

151
00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:02,041
- BECAUSE YOU SAID THIS WAS AN
OFFICIAL SCHOOL FIELD TRIP,

152
00:10:02,125 --> 00:10:03,125
YOU MORON!

153
00:10:03,208 --> 00:10:04,541
THAT'S WHY I DIDN'T WEAR
MY OWN SWIMSUIT.

154
00:10:04,625 --> 00:10:06,625
I LOOK SO STUPID. I'LL NEVER
FORGIVE YOU FOR THIS!

155
00:10:06,708 --> 00:10:07,708
- I THINK I CAN FIX IT!

156
00:10:07,791 --> 00:10:10,041
I BROUGHT AN EXTRA
SWIMSUIT WITH ME.

157
00:10:10,125 --> 00:10:12,416
- AHH!

158
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:14,750
IT'S THE EXACT SAME SUIT,
YOU DUMMY!

159
00:10:14,833 --> 00:10:17,291
PLUS YOUR GIGANTIC MELONS
STRETCHED IT ALL OUT ON TOP!

160
00:10:17,375 --> 00:10:19,083
WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO PULL
HERE? I'M GONNA KILL YOU.

161
00:10:21,166 --> 00:10:22,250
- KOUMEI?

162
00:10:22,333 --> 00:10:25,666
- NICE TRY,
BUT THAT'S TOO SMALL.

163
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:27,416
YOU EXPECT ME TO WEAR
A MUNCHKIN SUIT?

164
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:29,541
I'M NOT SOME DEAD MIDGET
FROM "THE WIZARD OF OZ."

165
00:10:29,625 --> 00:10:30,833
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?

166
00:10:30,916 --> 00:10:33,125
- COME BACK HERE, YOU LITTLE--

167
00:10:33,208 --> 00:10:35,166
I'M NOT DONE
STRANGLING YOU YET!

168
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:37,666
- DON'T YELL AT ME ANYMORE.
STOP!

169
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:40,625
- Kan'u:
FINE, I'LL ENTER THE CONTEST.

170
00:10:40,708 --> 00:10:43,708
IF I WIN, I'LL BUY YOU A NEW
SWIMSUIT WITH THE PRIZE MONEY.

171
00:10:43,791 --> 00:10:46,125
SO WOULD THE BOTH OF YOU
STOP MAKING A SCENE?

172
00:10:46,208 --> 00:10:48,666
- Ekitoku:
YOU'LL WIN IT FOR SURE, KAN'U!

173
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:51,791
- Ryuubi: GO FOR IT.
DO YOUR BEST, KAN'U!

174
00:10:53,708 --> 00:10:55,833
- ( stomach growling )
- HUH?

175
00:10:58,208 --> 00:11:00,416
- I'M STARVING.

176
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:05,291
HAKUFU HAS BEEN SHIPWRECKED
WITHOUT FOOD OR WATER.

177
00:11:05,375 --> 00:11:06,833
- MISS SONSAKU?

178
00:11:15,416 --> 00:11:18,250
- ( crying )

179
00:11:18,333 --> 00:11:21,333
- AH, THAT HIT THE SPOT.
THANKS FOR THE FOOD, RYU-CHAN.

180
00:11:21,416 --> 00:11:23,250
- GLAD WE WERE HERE TO HELP.

181
00:11:23,333 --> 00:11:25,625
- IF ONLY I'D JUST
IGNORED THAT GUY.

182
00:11:25,708 --> 00:11:27,791
- STOP BEING SO HARD
ON YOURSELF, CHUUBO.

183
00:11:27,875 --> 00:11:30,750
AS USUAL, IT'S STUPID HAKUFU
WHO SCREWED THINGS UP.

184
00:11:30,833 --> 00:11:33,083
- HEY!
I'M NOT STUPID.  YOU--

185
00:11:33,166 --> 00:11:35,166
- WHY IS IT YOU CAN ONLY HEAR ME
WHEN I'M INSULTING YOU?

186
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:37,541
- HEY, STOP THAT, HAKUFU!
WHAT ARE YOU--

187
00:11:39,875 --> 00:11:40,583
- ( laughing )

188
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:42,500
- I'M GLAD YOU GOT FIRED.

189
00:11:42,583 --> 00:11:44,458
- IS THAT SOMETHING
YOU SHOULD BE HAPPY ABOUT?

190
00:11:44,541 --> 00:11:45,916
- WELL, IF YOU WERE WORKING,

191
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,833
WE WOULDN'T HAVE GOTTEN
TO HANG OUT TODAY.

192
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:49,750
AND THANK YOU, SONKEN,
FOR THE LUNCHES YOU BROUGHT

193
00:11:49,833 --> 00:11:51,166
TO THE PEACE COUNCIL.

194
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:52,666
- OH, PLEASE.
IT WAS MY PLEASURE.

195
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:53,666
- KOUKIN!

196
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:55,500
- UGH.
- WHAT'RE YOU STARING AT?

197
00:11:55,583 --> 00:11:57,500
HAVEN'T YOU SEEN
A GIRL GETTING A TAN?

198
00:11:57,583 --> 00:11:59,916
I WASN'T LOOKING AT ANYTHING.
- THEN WHY ARE YOU BLUSHING?

199
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,208
- I'M NOT!
I'M SUNBURNED.

200
00:12:12,416 --> 00:12:15,666
- Ryomou: THIS IS DEFINITELY
SONSAKU'S HANDIWORK.

201
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:17,166
- LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE FIRED.

202
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:19,041
- YUP.
JUST AS EXPECTED.

203
00:12:19,125 --> 00:12:20,791
- THAT'S OUR HAKUFU.

204
00:12:20,875 --> 00:12:23,500
DO YOU THINK THEY'RE
ALL OUT SWIMMING SOMEWHERE?

205
00:12:23,583 --> 00:12:24,666
- I WOULD PROBABLY SAY SO.

206
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:26,375
WHY DON'T WE GO
TAKE A DIP OURSELVES?

207
00:12:26,458 --> 00:12:27,375
- HUH?

208
00:12:27,458 --> 00:12:28,791
- WE'RE BOUND TO
RUN INTO SONSAKU

209
00:12:28,875 --> 00:12:30,250
AND THE OTHERS SOMEWHERE.

210
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:31,791
- I GUESS YOU'RE RIGHT.

211
00:12:31,875 --> 00:12:34,041
- FIRST SHE MAKES US COME.
THEN SHE DITCHES US.

212
00:12:34,125 --> 00:12:35,208
THAT MORON.

213
00:12:35,291 --> 00:12:37,500
- Hakufu: AH-- AH-CHOO!

214
00:12:37,583 --> 00:12:40,541
- BIG SISTER HAKUFU,
ARE YOU CATCHING A COLD?

215
00:12:40,625 --> 00:12:43,000
- NAH, I'M FINE.
- HERE COMES THE SERVE!

216
00:12:43,083 --> 00:12:44,416
- ALL OF A SUDDEN,
I HAVE A FEELING

217
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:46,833
THERE'S SOMETHING I FORGOT. AHH!

218
00:12:46,916 --> 00:12:49,708
- Kan'u: THAT GIRL SONKEN--
SHE'S SONSAKU'S SISTER?

219
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:51,166
- THAT'S RIGHT.

220
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:53,250
- SHE'S VERY POLITE
AND RESPONSIBLE.

221
00:12:53,333 --> 00:12:55,708
IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE
THEY ARE RELATED.

222
00:12:55,791 --> 00:12:58,541
- I KNOW.
PLUS CHUUBO'S A GREAT COOK.

223
00:12:58,625 --> 00:13:00,708
- THEN SONSAKU
ISN'T A GOOD COOK?

224
00:13:00,791 --> 00:13:03,083
- NOT IF YOU PLAN ON EATING.
- HMM.

225
00:13:03,166 --> 00:13:05,083
THAT DOESN'T SURPRISE ME.

226
00:13:09,833 --> 00:13:12,708
- HUH? HMM.

227
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:15,125
- SPIKE!
- OH!

228
00:13:15,208 --> 00:13:17,291
- NICE DIG, GENTOKU!

229
00:13:23,333 --> 00:13:25,583
- BOX?

230
00:13:25,666 --> 00:13:29,458
- Ekitoku: IT LOOKS LIKE
SOME SORT OF ENCODED MAP.

231
00:13:29,541 --> 00:13:32,041
- IT'S A MAP TO PIRATE TREASURE!
- YOINK!

232
00:13:32,125 --> 00:13:34,875
ACCORDING TO THIS, WHATEVER IT
IS IS HIDDEN IN A NEARBY CAVE.

233
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:36,875
LET'S HAVE AN ADVENTURE
AND GO CHECK IT OUT.

234
00:13:36,958 --> 00:13:39,125
- I WANT TREASURE.
GIVE IT BACK!

235
00:13:39,208 --> 00:13:41,666
KOUKIN!
- HUH?

236
00:13:45,208 --> 00:13:47,500
- Housen: DON'T TOUCH ME.
- HMM?

237
00:13:47,583 --> 00:13:49,000
- RYOMOU.

238
00:13:49,083 --> 00:13:50,541
- LOOKS LIKE THERE'RE STILL A
FEW HOT CHICKS LEFT HERE.

239
00:13:50,625 --> 00:13:53,041
- OH, NO!
- ( man chuckling )

240
00:13:53,125 --> 00:13:54,333
LUCKY GIRL.

241
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:56,333
WE'RE THE GUYS
WHO RULE THIS BEACH.

242
00:13:56,416 --> 00:13:58,458
DON'T YOU KNOW THAT?
AND YOU'RE--

243
00:13:58,541 --> 00:14:00,125
- NOT AGAIN.

244
00:14:00,208 --> 00:14:02,000
DOH!

245
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:07,125
MAYBE WE SHOULD
STOP PUTTING THE MOVES

246
00:14:07,208 --> 00:14:09,333
ON ALL THESE CRAZY
STRONG FIGHTER CHICKS.

247
00:14:09,416 --> 00:14:12,333
FIRST THE ONE WITH THE BOOBY
BOMBS, NOW EYE-PATCH GIRL.

248
00:14:12,416 --> 00:14:14,250
- BOOBY BOMBS?

249
00:14:14,333 --> 00:14:16,583
HEY!
- ( both shuddering )

250
00:14:16,666 --> 00:14:18,666
- WHERE'S THE GIRL
WITH THE HUGE RACK NOW?

251
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:21,416
- HER? SHE WAS HEADED
TOWARDS THE BACK BAY CAVE

252
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:22,833
LAST TIME I SAW HER.

253
00:14:22,916 --> 00:14:25,375
- HOW DO WE GET THERE?
WHAT'S THE FASTEST WAY?

254
00:14:25,458 --> 00:14:28,333
- THE QUICKEST WAY TO GET THERE
FROM HERE IS BY MOTOR BOAT.

255
00:14:28,416 --> 00:14:31,875
WE'D BE HAPPY TO LET YOU BORROW
OURS IF YOU DON'T HAVE ONE.

256
00:14:31,958 --> 00:14:36,083
BUT THAT PLACE--
- HMM?

257
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:40,208
- ( humming )

258
00:14:40,291 --> 00:14:43,500
- "DEAR SHIRYU,
WE'RE GOING ON A TREASURE HUNT.

259
00:14:43,583 --> 00:14:45,708
PLEASE LOOK AFTER KOUMEI
WHILE WE'RE AWAY.

260
00:14:45,791 --> 00:14:47,708
THANK YOU, RYUUBI."

261
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:55,583
- All: WOW.

262
00:15:00,583 --> 00:15:02,875
- Hakufu:
LOOK AT EVERYTHING SPARKLING!

263
00:15:02,958 --> 00:15:04,375
IS ALL OF IT TREASURE?

264
00:15:04,458 --> 00:15:06,041
- DON'T BE STUPID.

265
00:15:06,125 --> 00:15:08,458
THAT'S JUST THE LIMESTONE
GLISTENING IN THE STALACTITES.

266
00:15:08,541 --> 00:15:11,583
- STOP CALLING ME STUPID!
- I DIDN'T MEAN IT.

267
00:15:11,666 --> 00:15:13,250
- DON'T RUN AWAY
FROM ME, YOU COWARD.

268
00:15:13,333 --> 00:15:15,833
- WHAT'S WITH THOSE TWO?
- ( chuckles )

269
00:15:18,416 --> 00:15:21,375
- IT'S SO PRETTY.

270
00:15:21,458 --> 00:15:23,375
- IT'S SO WONDROUS AND AMAZING.

271
00:15:23,458 --> 00:15:25,541
WHAT DO YOU THINK,
BIG SISTER?  HUH?

272
00:15:25,625 --> 00:15:28,291
THEY'RE GONE.

273
00:15:28,375 --> 00:15:31,000
WHERE DID THEY GO?

274
00:15:31,083 --> 00:15:33,083
- ♪ TREASURE HUNTING,
TREASURE HUNTING ♪

275
00:15:33,166 --> 00:15:35,333
♪ O WHERE IN THIS CAVE
COULD OUR TREASURE BE? ♪

276
00:15:35,416 --> 00:15:36,750
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

277
00:15:36,833 --> 00:15:39,000
THE TIDE IN HERE
SEEMS TO BE RISING.

278
00:15:39,083 --> 00:15:42,375
- GENTOKU,
WATCH YOUR STEP IT'S SLIPPERY.

279
00:15:44,666 --> 00:15:46,333
WHERE DID SHE GO?

280
00:15:46,416 --> 00:15:48,791
- CHUUBO?
YOU THERE?

281
00:15:48,875 --> 00:15:52,291
- ( sighing )

282
00:15:55,541 --> 00:15:58,000
- IS THIS WHERE WE STARTED?

283
00:15:58,083 --> 00:16:00,416
- THE TIDE MUST HAVE COME IN.

284
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,875
- OH.
THE WATER'S SO CLEAR.

285
00:16:02,958 --> 00:16:05,583
IT'S LOVELY.
DON'T YOU AGREE, MISS RYUUBI?

286
00:16:05,666 --> 00:16:09,875
- UM, I GUESS IT IS.

287
00:16:09,958 --> 00:16:11,416
- GENTOKU!

288
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:14,291
- CHUUBO!
- HUH?

289
00:16:14,375 --> 00:16:16,666
- FOR CRYING OUT LOUD,
WHERE'D SHE DISAPPEAR TO?

290
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:18,666
THAT DUMMY!
WHA--!

291
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:23,666
- COME, JUMP IN.
THE WATER'S NICE AND WARM.

292
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:26,875
- I, UM, CAN'T SWIM.

293
00:16:26,958 --> 00:16:29,708
- STILL, THIS IS
SUCH A LOVELY SPOT TO SWIM.

294
00:16:29,791 --> 00:16:31,250
I WONDER WHY THERE
AREN'T MORE PEOPLE

295
00:16:31,333 --> 00:16:33,541
OUT HERE ENJOYING THE WATER.

296
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,041
- SHARK-INFESTED?
- ( Sonken screaming )

297
00:16:43,125 --> 00:16:45,416
- All: HUH?

298
00:16:48,541 --> 00:16:50,041
- IT'S COMING!

299
00:16:51,583 --> 00:16:54,625
- I GOT YOU!

300
00:16:54,708 --> 00:16:58,583
- GENTOKU.  HUH?
- UH, I'M SCARED.

301
00:16:58,666 --> 00:17:00,375
- ME TOO.

302
00:17:00,458 --> 00:17:04,458
- SUN-- SUN TZU TEACHES--
WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO?

303
00:17:06,041 --> 00:17:08,666
- CHOU'UN,
GENTOKU IS IN DANGER.

304
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:10,708
- I KNOW, KOUMEI.
DON'T WORRY.

305
00:17:28,375 --> 00:17:29,875
- ( both gasp )

306
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:37,875
- ( Kan'u panting )

307
00:17:39,541 --> 00:17:40,875
- Both: WHOA!

308
00:17:40,958 --> 00:17:42,875
- GENTOKU.
- AND CHUUBO!

309
00:17:42,958 --> 00:17:44,791
- BIG SISTER.
- KAN'U!

310
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,125
- ( growls )

311
00:17:48,208 --> 00:17:50,041
- ( both gasp )

312
00:17:52,333 --> 00:17:53,500
( both shuddering )

313
00:17:53,583 --> 00:17:54,875
- Both: HYAH!

314
00:17:57,333 --> 00:17:59,875
- NOT DONE.
- Ryomou: I GOT THIS!

315
00:17:59,958 --> 00:18:02,000
HYAH!

316
00:18:05,666 --> 00:18:07,833
- GOT HIM!

317
00:18:17,541 --> 00:18:20,583
- IT LOOKS
LIKE THIS BATTLE IS OVER.

318
00:18:22,458 --> 00:18:24,041
- ( both panting )

319
00:18:24,125 --> 00:18:26,833
- WE WENT THE WRONG WAY
OUT OF THE DAMN CAVE!

320
00:18:26,916 --> 00:18:28,916
- THANK GOODNESS
YOU'RE BOTH OKAY.

321
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,833
- YOU SAVED US.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

322
00:18:31,916 --> 00:18:33,583
- ARE YOU HURT?
- NO.

323
00:18:33,666 --> 00:18:34,916
- MMM.

324
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,583
- OH! THANK YOU VERY MUCH
FOR YOUR HELP, EVERYONE.

325
00:18:37,666 --> 00:18:40,000
- IS SHE--  NO.

326
00:18:40,083 --> 00:18:42,166
- THAT'S ENOUGH
THANKING EVERYBODY.

327
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:44,208
BOTH OF YOU, HOP IN THE BOAT.

328
00:18:46,833 --> 00:18:49,666
- ( growling )
- OHH!

329
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:50,791
- OH NO.

330
00:18:55,333 --> 00:18:57,583
- ( gasps )

331
00:19:02,333 --> 00:19:03,208
- WHOA!

332
00:19:09,083 --> 00:19:10,958
- HUH?

333
00:19:12,708 --> 00:19:16,041
- I KNOW THAT ATTACK.

334
00:19:19,541 --> 00:19:21,500
YOU'RE HOUSEN RYOFU!
- All: HMM?

335
00:19:21,583 --> 00:19:25,625
- ADMIT IT! YOU ARE HOUSEN
RYOFU, AND YET YOU CAN'T BE.

336
00:19:25,708 --> 00:19:28,166
SHE SACRIFICED HERSELF
DEFEATING TOUTAKU.

337
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:30,500
- BUT THIS IS HER
AND SHE IS INDEED ALIVE.

338
00:19:30,583 --> 00:19:32,833
UNFORTUNATELY,
SHE SEEMS TO HAVE AMNESIA.

339
00:19:32,916 --> 00:19:35,666
- SHE HAS AMNESIA?

340
00:19:37,041 --> 00:19:38,708
PERHAPS THAT'S WHY
I COULD NOT SENSE IT.

341
00:19:38,791 --> 00:19:41,666
THE KILLER
I FELT INSIDE HER BEFORE.

342
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:43,291
BUT IS IT GONE?

343
00:19:45,291 --> 00:19:47,125
IF SHE IS HOUSEN RYOFU,

344
00:19:47,208 --> 00:19:49,708
THE INCREDIBLE POWER
OF HER ATTACK MAKES SENSE.

345
00:19:49,791 --> 00:19:52,458
IS THE REAL HER
LURKING BENEATH THE SURFACE?

346
00:19:52,541 --> 00:19:55,208
DO YOU REMEMBER THE TIME
WHEN YOU AND I FOUGHT BEFORE?

347
00:19:55,291 --> 00:19:57,875
WELL ANSWER ME.
DO YOU?

348
00:19:57,958 --> 00:20:00,875
- SUN TZU TEACHES,
OPPONENTS MUST ALWAYS FIGHT

349
00:20:00,958 --> 00:20:03,083
WITHOUT INCURRING CASUALTIES.

350
00:20:03,166 --> 00:20:05,291
- YOU SHOULD FORGIVE
AND ACCEPT YOUR FORMER FOES.

351
00:20:05,375 --> 00:20:06,666
IT WILL EVENTUALLY
LEAD TO PEACE

352
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:09,541
AND HEGEMONY OVER
THE LAND. WHICH MEANS...

353
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:13,000
- THAT YESTERDAY'S ENEMY
IS TOMORROW'S FRIEND.

354
00:20:13,083 --> 00:20:14,083
- GENTOKU.

355
00:20:14,166 --> 00:20:16,166
- AND DON'T FORGET
ONE MORE THING.

356
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:19,000
MISS CHUUBO AND I
OWE OUR LIVES TO MISS RYOFU.

357
00:20:19,083 --> 00:20:22,208
- UH... OH.

358
00:20:22,291 --> 00:20:25,916
- WHICH MEANS THAT...

359
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,375
FORMER FOES ARE NOW FRIENDS.
- THAT'S RIGHT.

360
00:20:29,458 --> 00:20:32,458
- ( giggles )
NEW FRIENDS, NEW FRIENDS!

361
00:20:32,541 --> 00:20:34,666
( laughs )

362
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:37,958
- Ekitoku: SO WHAT THIS MAP
WAS ACTUALLY POINTING OUT

363
00:20:38,041 --> 00:20:41,208
WERE SHARK-INFESTED WATERS.
- BUT EKITOKU,

364
00:20:41,291 --> 00:20:44,083
WE MAY NOT HAVE FOUND
ACTUAL TREASURE IN THAT CAVE,

365
00:20:44,166 --> 00:20:46,333
BUT WE MADE
SOME TREASURED MEMORIES TODAY.

366
00:20:46,416 --> 00:20:47,583
- BAH! MEMORIES?

367
00:20:47,666 --> 00:20:49,291
THEY DON'T FILL THE
PURSE OR THE STOMACH,

368
00:20:49,375 --> 00:20:50,833
SO TO ME
THEY'RE NOT WORTH A CENT.

369
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:52,875
- Housen: TREASURED MEMORIES?

370
00:20:52,958 --> 00:20:57,750
- I HOPE I HAD MANY
IN MY PREVIOUS LIFE.

371
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:05,750
- Kakouen: ARE YOU SERIOUS?

372
00:21:05,833 --> 00:21:08,125
- YEAH,
I CAN TAKE YOU TO HIM.

373
00:21:08,208 --> 00:21:11,791
YOUR LEADER, MOUTOKU SOUSOU,
IS ALIVE AND WELL.

374
00:21:11,875 --> 00:21:13,458
- PROVE IT.
WHERE IS HE?

375
00:21:13,541 --> 00:21:17,083
- IF YOU WANT TO KNOW THAT,
YOU'LL HAVE TO HELP ME.

376
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:20,666
MYOUSAI KAKOUEN.

377
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:22,875
- I AM A VASSAL.

378
00:21:22,958 --> 00:21:24,666
MOUTOKU IS MY LIEGE.

379
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:26,666
WHERE HE IS, I MUST BE.

380
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:29,250
HE AND I ARE TOGETHER,
ALWAYS.

381
00:21:29,333 --> 00:21:31,500
- SHALL I TAKE THAT TO MEAN
THAT I HAVE YOUR ATTENTION

382
00:21:31,583 --> 00:21:32,625
AND YOU'LL COOPERATE?

383
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:35,500
THAT YOU'LL HELP
ME, SHISHI OUIN?

384
00:21:35,583 --> 00:21:37,583
- HMM?

385
00:21:37,666 --> 00:21:40,791
- ALSO KNOWN AS GENPOU SAJI.

386
00:21:47,875 --> 00:21:51,791
- ( end theme playing )

387
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:55,791
- ( singing in Japanese )

388
00:23:18,208 --> 00:23:21,000
- Sonken: HERE'S THE BILL
FROM THAT LITTLE RAMEN SHOP

389
00:23:21,083 --> 00:23:23,083
ON THE BEACH YOU DESTROYED,
BIG SISTER.

390
00:23:23,166 --> 00:23:25,125
- Hakufu: AAH!
I CAN'T POSSIBLY PAY THIS MUCH.

391
00:23:25,208 --> 00:23:27,625
I KNOW-- WE'LL USE THE PRIZE
MONEY KAN-CHAN WON

392
00:23:27,708 --> 00:23:29,041
TO COVER THE DAMAGES.

393
00:23:29,125 --> 00:23:31,125
- Kan'u: YOU GUYS ATE
AND DRANK EVERY PENNY

394
00:23:31,208 --> 00:23:33,166
I WON THAT DAY
BACK AT THE BEACH.

395
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:36,000
AND I WAS PLANNING ON USING IT
TO BUY SOMETHING FOR GENTOKU.

396
00:23:36,083 --> 00:23:38,416
- Hakufu: FOR RYU-CHAN?
WHAT WERE YOU GONNA GET HER?

397
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:41,500
SWIMWEAR?  LINGERIE?
SOMETHING SPICY?

398
00:23:41,583 --> 00:23:43,250
- Sonken:
BIG SISTER, IT'S IN BAD TASTE

399
00:23:43,333 --> 00:23:45,333
TO ASK SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
