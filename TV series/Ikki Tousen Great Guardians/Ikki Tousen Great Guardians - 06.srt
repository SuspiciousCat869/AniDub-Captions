1
00:02:08,375 --> 00:02:11,083
- "RYOMOU, FORGIVE ME."

2
00:02:21,041 --> 00:02:23,833
- ( doorbell rings )
- HMM?

3
00:02:26,291 --> 00:02:29,333
- MOU-CHAN.
- SONSAKU AND SONKEN.

4
00:02:29,416 --> 00:02:31,333
WHAT BRINGS THE TWO OF YOU
HERE TODAY?

5
00:02:31,416 --> 00:02:33,041
- UM, I DID--

6
00:02:33,125 --> 00:02:34,833
I WANTED TO INVITE
YOU AND MISS RYOFU

7
00:02:34,916 --> 00:02:36,083
OUT TO DO SOMETHING FUN TODAY.

8
00:02:36,166 --> 00:02:37,500
BIG SISTER HAKUFU AND I,

9
00:02:37,583 --> 00:02:38,750
WE THOUGHT WE
COULD HAVE--

10
00:02:38,833 --> 00:02:40,583
- HAVE EITHER OF YOU SEEN RYOFU?
- ( both gasp )

11
00:02:40,666 --> 00:02:42,041
- DID SOMETHING HAPPEN
TO FU-CHIN?

12
00:02:42,125 --> 00:02:44,583
- SHE'S GONE.

13
00:02:47,833 --> 00:02:50,500
- SHE LEFT A NOTE?

14
00:02:50,583 --> 00:02:53,375
- ARE YOU SURE SHE WOULDN'T MIND
THAT WE'RE READING THIS TOO?

15
00:02:56,791 --> 00:03:00,583
"OVER THE PAST FEW DAYS,
I'VE HAD FUN WITH MY FRIENDS

16
00:03:00,666 --> 00:03:03,375
AND CREATED WONDERFUL
NEW MEMORIES..."

17
00:03:03,458 --> 00:03:05,875
- Housen: "...BUT SOMETHING
WAS STILL MISSING.

18
00:03:05,958 --> 00:03:09,916
WITHOUT THE MEMORIES
OF THE PERSON I USED TO BE,

19
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,458
A PART OF ME FEELS EMPTY.

20
00:03:12,541 --> 00:03:15,833
NOT KNOWING IS HURTING ME.

21
00:03:15,916 --> 00:03:19,666
THAT'S WHY I HAVE TO LEAVE.
I NEED TO FIND MY PAST."

22
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,291
- WHOA!

23
00:03:39,375 --> 00:03:41,250
- CAREFUL.

24
00:03:41,333 --> 00:03:43,250
- ( sighs )

25
00:03:43,333 --> 00:03:45,458
- YOU ALL RIGHT?

26
00:03:45,541 --> 00:03:47,958
- UH, YEAH.

27
00:03:51,208 --> 00:03:55,000
- HE HAS A SACRED BEAD.
- HUH?

28
00:03:57,166 --> 00:03:59,833
- WHERE DO YOU THINK FU-CHIN
MIGHT HAVE GONE?

29
00:03:59,916 --> 00:04:01,625
- IT DOESN'T MATTER.
- MOU-CHAN!

30
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:04,208
AREN'T YOU WORRIED
ABOUT FU-CHIN?

31
00:04:04,291 --> 00:04:06,208
- IT'S NOT HER FAULT.

32
00:04:06,291 --> 00:04:09,208
- RYOFU MADE THE DECISION
TO LEAVE ON HER OWN.

33
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:11,625
AND BESIDES, OUR WORRYING
WON'T CHANGE ANYTHING.

34
00:04:11,708 --> 00:04:14,166
- I GUESS YOU'RE RIGHT,
BUT STILL I THINK WE-- 

35
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:17,166
- THEN STOP TALKING ABOUT
IT ALREADY. LET HER GO.

36
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:20,166
- BUT MO-CHAN--
- QUIT YOUR WHINING.

37
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:23,333
- ( whimpering )

38
00:04:26,875 --> 00:04:29,583
- WHERE DID YOU GO
TO FIND YOURSELF, RYOFU?

39
00:04:29,666 --> 00:04:31,291
- ( door opens )
- OH!

40
00:04:31,375 --> 00:04:34,666
SON-- SONSAKU!
- LIAR.  I HEARD YOU.

41
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:38,041
- WHAT?  WHAT DID YOU HEAR?
- JUST NOW, I HEARD YOU SAY,

42
00:04:38,125 --> 00:04:40,875
"WHERE DID YOU GO
TO FIND YOURSELF?" TO FU-CHIN.

43
00:04:40,958 --> 00:04:44,083
- YOU-- YOU WERE EAVESDROPPING
ON ME WHILE I'M ON THE TOILET?

44
00:04:44,166 --> 00:04:46,166
- ( laughs )
ADMIT IT--

45
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:47,833
YOU ARE WORRIED AFTER ALL.

46
00:04:47,916 --> 00:04:49,541
- ARGH!
- AH!

47
00:04:49,625 --> 00:04:50,916
- ( punching sounds )

48
00:04:53,666 --> 00:04:56,708
- MOU-- MOU-CHAN.

49
00:04:56,791 --> 00:05:00,333
SINCE IT'S OBVIOUS
YOU ARE WORRIED ABOUT FU-CHIN,

50
00:05:00,416 --> 00:05:03,000
WE SHOULD GO OUT AND FIND HER.
- NO THANKS.

51
00:05:03,083 --> 00:05:05,333
- LET'S GO.
- NO.

52
00:05:05,416 --> 00:05:07,916
- COME ON, MO-CHAN.
- I TOLD YOU I'M NOT GOING.

53
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
- AND I SAY YES YOU ARE.
NOW GET UP!

54
00:05:11,083 --> 00:05:12,083
- HYAH!

55
00:05:12,166 --> 00:05:13,916
- AHH! MOU-CHAN,
YOU'RE BREAKING MY ARM!

56
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,875
STOP IT.  I GIVE.  I GIVE!

57
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,666
- I'M A FIGHTER?

58
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:24,666
- YES.
- I DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND,

59
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:26,916
BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE SEEM TO BE
PICKING FIGHTS WITH ME

60
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,833
BECAUSE OF
THIS "SACRED BEAD" THING.

61
00:05:28,916 --> 00:05:31,750
HEY, ARE YOU A FIGHTER TOO?

62
00:05:35,333 --> 00:05:36,625
YOU ARE.

63
00:05:36,708 --> 00:05:39,708
SO WHAT'S BEING A FIGHTER
ALL ABOUT THEN?

64
00:05:39,791 --> 00:05:41,666
- NO IDEA.
- WHAT?

65
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:44,333
- I DON'T REMEMBER.

66
00:05:44,416 --> 00:05:47,375
I HAVE AMNESIA.
- HEY, YOU HAVE AMNESIA?

67
00:05:47,458 --> 00:05:50,666
SO DO I!  I DON'T REMEMBER
ANYTHING EITHER.

68
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:53,375
THOUGH I WAS ABLE TO FIND OUT
MY NAME.

69
00:05:53,458 --> 00:05:57,000
LUCKY FOR ME, ONE OF THOSE BOZOS
WHO PICKED A FIGHT WITH ME

70
00:05:57,083 --> 00:05:59,000
KEPT YELLING IT AT
THE TOP OF HIS LUNGS.

71
00:05:59,083 --> 00:06:00,041
- OH.

72
00:06:00,125 --> 00:06:03,875
- I'M GENJYO KAKOUTON.
AND YOU ARE?

73
00:06:03,958 --> 00:06:05,916
- I'M RYOFU.

74
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,416
- OUCH.  THAT REALLY HURTS.

75
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:11,375
MOU-CHAN WAS SERIOUSLY ANGRY
WITH ME THIS TIME.

76
00:06:11,458 --> 00:06:13,375
STILL CAN'T BELIEVE
SHE THREW US OUT.

77
00:06:13,458 --> 00:06:15,791
- ( giggles )
- IT'S ALL FU-CHIN'S FAULT.

78
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:17,875
IF ONLY SHE WROTE
WHERE SHE WENT.

79
00:06:17,958 --> 00:06:19,791
- I MIGHT KNOW.

80
00:06:19,875 --> 00:06:22,041
- YOU HAVE AN IDEA
WHERE SHE MIGHT BE?

81
00:06:22,125 --> 00:06:23,875
- BIG BROTHER KOUKIN
SAID SOMETHING

82
00:06:23,958 --> 00:06:25,250
WHEN HE FIRST RECOGNIZED HER.

83
00:06:25,333 --> 00:06:28,833
- I KNOW THAT UNIFORM.
IT'S RAKUYO.

84
00:06:28,916 --> 00:06:31,291
- IT MIGHT NOT BE
THE BIGGEST CLUE,

85
00:06:31,375 --> 00:06:33,416
BUT AT LEAST IT'S SOMETHING
WE HAVE TO GO ON.

86
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,250
IF NOTHING ELSE,
IT'S A PLACE TO START.

87
00:06:35,333 --> 00:06:40,250
- THAT'S A GREAT IDEA!
LET'S GO!

88
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:42,125
WAIT A MINUTE.

89
00:06:42,208 --> 00:06:45,041
WHERE IS RAKUYO HIGH?
- UM, WELL--

90
00:06:49,666 --> 00:06:51,875
- Kakouton: RAKUYO HIGH SCHOOL.

91
00:06:51,958 --> 00:06:54,041
ARE YOU SURE THIS IS
WHERE YOU WENT TO SCHOOL?

92
00:06:54,125 --> 00:06:56,833
- PRETTY SURE.

93
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:59,791
- CAN I ASK YOU A QUESTION?
- WHAT?

94
00:06:59,875 --> 00:07:03,208
- DOES THE NAME MOTOKOU
MEAN ANYTHING TO YOU?

95
00:07:03,291 --> 00:07:06,625
- MOTOKOU?  NO.

96
00:07:06,708 --> 00:07:08,125
- I FIGURED.

97
00:07:08,208 --> 00:07:10,750
- WAS HE A STUDENT
AT RAKUYO HIGH SCHOOL?

98
00:07:10,833 --> 00:07:13,041
- HE WAS MY FRIEND.

99
00:07:13,125 --> 00:07:17,208
I COULDN'T EVEN REMEMBER
WHAT MY OWN NAME WAS,

100
00:07:17,291 --> 00:07:21,708
BUT I REMEMBERED HIS NAME--
MOTOKOU SOUSOU.

101
00:07:21,791 --> 00:07:24,875
GUESS HE MUST'VE BEEN SOMEONE
VERY IMPORTANT TO ME.

102
00:07:24,958 --> 00:07:27,500
- I ENVY YOU.
- HUH?

103
00:07:27,583 --> 00:07:30,875
- I CAN'T REMEMBER
ANYONE IMPORTANT TO ME.

104
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:42,083
- SHOULD WE CALL BIG BROTHER
KOUKIN AND ASK HIM WHERE IT IS?

105
00:07:42,166 --> 00:07:43,458
- OKAY.

106
00:07:46,625 --> 00:07:47,958
- Ryomou:
I KNOW HOW TO GET THERE.

107
00:07:48,041 --> 00:07:50,500
- HUH?

108
00:07:50,583 --> 00:07:52,833
- SO YOU'LL HELP?!
THANK YOU, MOU-CHAN!

109
00:07:52,916 --> 00:07:55,166
YOU'RE SO NICE--

110
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:58,041
- STOP!  YOU'VE BEEN
WAY TOO TOUCHY FEELY LATELY.

111
00:07:58,125 --> 00:08:01,625
I'VE HAD ENOUGH.
- ( garbled protesting )

112
00:08:01,708 --> 00:08:04,000
- CALM DOWN.

113
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:05,958
LET'S HEAD TO RAKUYO.
- ( both gasp )

114
00:08:06,041 --> 00:08:08,541
- Ryomou: THE SCHOOL'S
FIGHTING FACTION FELL APART

115
00:08:08,625 --> 00:08:11,458
AFTER ITS LEADER,
CHUEI TOUTAKU, DIED.

116
00:08:11,541 --> 00:08:14,916
BY NOW, THE ENTIRE CAMPUS HAS
PROBABLY BEEN LONG ABANDONED.

117
00:08:22,958 --> 00:08:25,416
- WOW.
THIS PLACE IS A WRECK.

118
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:28,541
HUH?  WAIT.

119
00:08:28,625 --> 00:08:31,041
HOLD UP.

120
00:08:31,125 --> 00:08:34,208
DO YOU REALLY THINK
YOU USED TO GO TO SCHOOL HERE?

121
00:08:34,291 --> 00:08:38,083
- I DON'T KNOW. THAT'S WHY
I WANT TO CHECK IT OUT.

122
00:08:38,166 --> 00:08:40,416
- AH. THEN I'LL
KEEP YOU COMPANY.

123
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:41,958
- WHY?

124
00:08:42,041 --> 00:08:44,000
- YOU AND I ARE BOTH FIGHTERS
WHO HAVE LOST OUR MEMORIES.

125
00:08:44,083 --> 00:08:47,083
MAYBE THIS IS A COINCIDENCE,
MAYBE IT'S NOT. BUT I THINK

126
00:08:47,166 --> 00:08:50,875
SOMETHING IN YOUR PAST
MIGHT HOLD THE KEY TO MY OWN.

127
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:53,333
- Girl: IT IS AS YOU PREDICTED.

128
00:08:53,416 --> 00:08:56,000
SHE CAME TO US
OF HER OWN FREE WILL.

129
00:08:56,083 --> 00:08:57,708
- I KNEW SHE WOULD COME.

130
00:08:57,791 --> 00:09:00,416
OTHERWISE I WOULDN'T HAVE RISKED
LETTING MOU-CHAN SEE ME.

131
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,791
SHE ASKED ME A LOT OF QUESTIONS.

132
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:05,125
- BUT WHO IS THAT MAN
ACCOMPANYING HER?

133
00:09:05,208 --> 00:09:06,750
- HIM?

134
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,791
I'LL HAVE KAKOUEN
TAKE CARE OF HIM.

135
00:09:29,708 --> 00:09:31,791
- Housen:
NOTHING FEELS FAMILIAR.

136
00:09:31,875 --> 00:09:35,791
I'M NOT CERTAIN OF ANYTHING.
DID I REALLY GO TO SCHOOL HERE?

137
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:40,208
WHAT IF I'M NEVER ABLE
TO GET MY MEMORIES BACK?

138
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:48,125
- Saji: I KNOW WHERE YOUR
MEMORIES ARE HIDING.

139
00:10:05,458 --> 00:10:08,458
- WHO ARE YOU?

140
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:11,375
- WHO AM I?  AFTER ALL
THAT'S PASSED BETWEEN US,

141
00:10:11,458 --> 00:10:13,500
IT HURTS WHEN YOU ACT
LIKE I'M A STRANGER.

142
00:10:13,583 --> 00:10:16,666
I KNOW EVERYTHING
THERE IS TO KNOW ABOUT YOU,

143
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:18,541
AND THEN SOME.

144
00:10:18,625 --> 00:10:20,791
I KNOW WHAT MAKES YOU TICK,

145
00:10:20,875 --> 00:10:23,583
HOW TO PUSH YOUR DEEPEST,
MOST SENSITIVE BUTTONS.

146
00:10:23,666 --> 00:10:26,666
AND YOU KNOW ME TOO,
INSIDE AND OUT.

147
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:28,500
- WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

148
00:10:28,583 --> 00:10:31,458
- I KNOW YOU BECAUSE
YOU USED TO BE MY GIRLFRIEND.

149
00:10:31,541 --> 00:10:34,125
- ( gasps )
- ( humming )

150
00:10:34,208 --> 00:10:37,875
- WHAT'S THAT YOU'RE HUMMING?
- IT'S A POP SONG.

151
00:10:37,958 --> 00:10:41,416
- YOU'RE INTO POP MUSIC THEN.
I'D NEVER GUESS THAT.

152
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:52,166
- HE'S NOT WEARING
A SACRED BEAD.

153
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:54,833
HEY, MAN!
WHAT'RE YOU, A FIGHTER?

154
00:10:54,916 --> 00:10:57,166
- DOES IT MATTER?

155
00:10:57,250 --> 00:10:59,166
- HOW DO I KNOW
YOU'RE TELLING THE TRUTH?

156
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:01,625
WAS SHE REALLY YOUR GIRLFRIEND?
- HA!

157
00:11:01,708 --> 00:11:03,958
WHY DO YOU CARE SO MUCH?
- SHUT UP.

158
00:11:04,041 --> 00:11:05,625
- WELL, IF YOU
WON'T LISTEN TO ME,

159
00:11:05,708 --> 00:11:07,916
THEN PERHAPS
YOU'LL BELIEVE HER.

160
00:11:12,625 --> 00:11:15,375
SHE USED TO BE
ACQUAINTED WITH YOU.

161
00:11:15,458 --> 00:11:18,041
ASK HER ANYTHING.
- YOU KNEW ME BEFORE?

162
00:11:18,125 --> 00:11:21,791
TELL ME, WHO AM I?
- YOU'RE GENJYO KAKOUTON

163
00:11:21,875 --> 00:11:24,875
FROM KYOSHO ACADEMY,
THAT'S WHO.

164
00:11:24,958 --> 00:11:27,625
- KYOSHO ACADEMY?
WAS THAT MY SCHOOL?

165
00:11:31,625 --> 00:11:33,791
- COME ON, LET'S GO.

166
00:11:38,416 --> 00:11:40,666
- YOU SAID
I USED TO BE YOUR GIRLFRIEND.

167
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:43,083
SO WE BROKE UP?
- YEAH. THOUGH WE WEREN'T

168
00:11:43,166 --> 00:11:46,000
EXACTLY IN WHAT YOU'D CALL
A TYPICAL RELATIONSHIP.

169
00:11:46,083 --> 00:11:49,083
EACH OF US HAD AN ULTERIOR
MOTIVE WHEN IT STARTED.

170
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:50,916
WE BOTH USED EACH OTHER
KNOWINGLY.

171
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,375
- USED EACH OTHER?
- IT MAY HAVE BEEN EXPLOITATIVE,

172
00:11:54,458 --> 00:11:57,625
BUT I THINK WE BOTH STILL HAD
A LOT OF FUN ALONG THE WAY.

173
00:11:57,708 --> 00:12:00,583
ARE YOU SURE
YOU DON'T REMEMBER?

174
00:12:00,666 --> 00:12:02,583
LOOKS LIKE
YOU FORGOT EVERYTHING.

175
00:12:02,666 --> 00:12:04,583
BUT NOT TO WORRY.

176
00:12:04,666 --> 00:12:07,166
THAT ACTUALLY
SUITS MY PURPOSES A BIT BETTER.

177
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:11,250
AS LONG AS SHE'S WITH ME--
- SHE?

178
00:12:11,333 --> 00:12:13,750
- MOU-CHAN DIDN'T TELL YOU
ABOUT US?

179
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:17,250
- RYOMOU?
- SHE'S MY RESPONSIBILITY.

180
00:12:17,333 --> 00:12:21,041
I'M GOING TO MAKE HER
INTO A REAL WOMAN.

181
00:12:21,125 --> 00:12:23,958
- CAREFUL NOW.
- Kakouton! HEY!

182
00:12:24,041 --> 00:12:26,041
JUST TELL ME
WHO THE HELL THIS WOMAN IS.

183
00:12:26,125 --> 00:12:29,958
- MYOSAI KAKOUEN.
SHE'S YOUR FRIEND.

184
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:32,291
- SOMETHING DOESN'T FEEL RIGHT.

185
00:12:32,375 --> 00:12:35,208
- KAKOUTON, COME WITH ME.

186
00:12:35,291 --> 00:12:37,625
- STOP! DON'T TALK
LIKE YOU KNOW WHO I AM.

187
00:12:37,708 --> 00:12:41,458
I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE.
- YO, EYE-PATCH BOY.

188
00:12:41,541 --> 00:12:43,041
YOU SHOULD DO AS KAKOUEN SAYS

189
00:12:43,125 --> 00:12:45,208
AND RETURN WITH HER
TO KYOSHO ACADEMY.

190
00:12:45,291 --> 00:12:48,625
MOUTOKU SOUSOU WILL BE THERE.
DON'T YOU WANT TO SEE HIM?

191
00:12:48,708 --> 00:12:51,625
- WAIT.
WHAT DID YOU JUST SAY?

192
00:12:51,708 --> 00:12:54,958
- HA!
- STOP!  BASTARD!

193
00:12:55,041 --> 00:12:58,333
UH?  WHAT THE--
HEY, LET GO!

194
00:12:58,416 --> 00:13:01,625
- YOU WILL COME TO KYOSHO.

195
00:13:01,708 --> 00:13:04,750
- HEY! I TOLD YOU ALREADY,
I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE WITH--

196
00:13:04,833 --> 00:13:07,541
( grunts )

197
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:12,583
WELL, AT LEAST NOW I KNOW.

198
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:15,833
YOU GUYS
ARE NO FRIENDS OF MINE!

199
00:13:23,458 --> 00:13:24,833
WHAT THE--

200
00:13:24,916 --> 00:13:28,416
- IT'S UNFAIR TO USE A WEAPON
ON AN UNARMED PERSON.

201
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:32,000
IT'S UNFAIR TO USE A KNIFE
ON AN UNARMED PERSON!

202
00:13:32,083 --> 00:13:34,333
- DO I KNOW YOU?

203
00:13:34,416 --> 00:13:37,625
- ( sighs ) WHAT'RE YOU
TALKING ABOUT, TON-CHAN?

204
00:13:37,708 --> 00:13:39,333
IT'S ME, HAKUFU.

205
00:13:39,416 --> 00:13:41,250
WE USED TO PRACTICE FIGHTING
AND BASICS

206
00:13:41,333 --> 00:13:43,583
AND DO A BUNCH OF OTHER STUPID
STUFF THAT FRIENDS DO TOGETHER.

207
00:13:43,666 --> 00:13:46,500
DID YOU FORGET?
- STUPID?

208
00:13:46,583 --> 00:13:49,375
HA! YOU WROTE YOUR NAME
ON YOUR SACRED BEAD.

209
00:13:49,458 --> 00:13:51,583
HOW STUPID!
- LEAVE ME ALONE.

210
00:13:51,666 --> 00:13:53,708
AND DON'T CALL ME STUPID.

211
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:56,041
- HMM.

212
00:13:56,125 --> 00:14:00,541
"HA-KU-FU SON-SA-KU."

213
00:14:00,625 --> 00:14:03,000
I REMEMBER!
YOU'RE HAKUFU SONSAKU.

214
00:14:03,083 --> 00:14:06,333
- WHAT?  OF COURSE I AM.
WHY'RE YOU BEING SO FORMAL?

215
00:14:06,416 --> 00:14:08,125
- SORRY.

216
00:14:08,208 --> 00:14:11,083
I'VE FORGOTTEN ALMOST EVERY
SINGLE THING ABOUT MY LIFE.

217
00:14:11,166 --> 00:14:13,833
EXCEPT THERE'S ONE THING
I DO REMEMBER.

218
00:14:13,916 --> 00:14:15,416
- WHAT?

219
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:19,208
- THAT HAKUFU SONSAKU IS STUPID.
- HEY!  DON'T CALL ME STUPID.

220
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:22,916
I ESPECIALLY DON'T WANT YOU
CALLING ME STUPID.

221
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,750
I'M INSULTED.
I SHOULD STOP BEING YOUR FRIEND.

222
00:14:25,833 --> 00:14:28,041
- YOU'RE MY FRIEND?

223
00:14:28,125 --> 00:14:31,708
THAT MAKES SENSE.
I REMEMBER SOMETHING ELSE.

224
00:14:31,791 --> 00:14:34,208
- YOU AND ME, WE'RE BOTH
ON THE SAME SIDE.

225
00:14:34,291 --> 00:14:36,458
- MM-HMM!

226
00:14:36,541 --> 00:14:39,750
- Hakufu: SONSAKU!
- BIG SISTER HAKUFU.

227
00:14:39,833 --> 00:14:41,000
- MOU-CHAN, CHUBO.

228
00:14:41,083 --> 00:14:42,416
- Saji: HOW NICE TO
SEE ALL OF YOU.

229
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:45,333
- HUH?

230
00:14:45,416 --> 00:14:46,333
- SAJI?

231
00:14:46,416 --> 00:14:50,041
- Sonken: LOOK, HE
HAS MISS RYOFU!

232
00:14:50,125 --> 00:14:51,416
- COME BACK!

233
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:53,875
I HAVE QUESTIONS FOR YOU SAJI.
YOU CAN'T HIDE.

234
00:14:53,958 --> 00:14:55,958
- MISS RYOMOU.

235
00:14:58,666 --> 00:15:01,541
- ( grunts )
- TON-CHAN.

236
00:15:01,625 --> 00:15:03,250
COME THIS WAY.

237
00:15:20,541 --> 00:15:22,250
- BRING HER OVER HERE TO ME.

238
00:15:30,375 --> 00:15:33,250
- ( both panting )
- DID WE FINALLY LOSE HER?

239
00:15:36,875 --> 00:15:38,416
- HYAH!

240
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:51,000
- HOLD ON!
WOULD YOU MIND STOPPING?

241
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:53,291
IF I RUIN ANOTHER UNIFORM,

242
00:15:53,375 --> 00:15:55,041
MY MAMA WILL KILL ME.

243
00:15:58,208 --> 00:16:00,583
- OH NO, YOU DON'T!

244
00:16:00,666 --> 00:16:02,541
( grunting )

245
00:16:06,541 --> 00:16:08,166
- HYAH!
- OOH!

246
00:16:24,958 --> 00:16:27,625
- LEAVE HER TO ME, TON-CHAN.
YOU GET OUTTA HERE AND--

247
00:16:27,708 --> 00:16:29,875
- LIKE HELL I WILL!
- HUH?

248
00:16:29,958 --> 00:16:31,875
- WHAT KIND OF A GUY
WOULD I BE

249
00:16:31,958 --> 00:16:34,791
IF I KEEP ALLOWING A GIRL
TO SAVE MY ASS ALL THE TIME?

250
00:16:34,875 --> 00:16:37,166
ROUND TWO.

251
00:16:41,708 --> 00:16:43,416
- ( gasps )

252
00:16:46,041 --> 00:16:47,458
RYOFU.

253
00:16:51,541 --> 00:16:53,875
COME ON, WAKE UP.

254
00:16:53,958 --> 00:16:56,375
- ( grunts )
- ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

255
00:16:56,458 --> 00:17:00,208
WHERE'S SAJI?
- WHO'S SAJI?

256
00:17:00,291 --> 00:17:04,333
- HE'S THE GUY WHO BROUGHT
YOU HERE. DID HE HURT YOU?

257
00:17:04,416 --> 00:17:06,166
- THAT'S RIGHT.

258
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:09,000
I CAME TO THIS PLACE
LOOKING FOR MY PAST,

259
00:17:09,083 --> 00:17:13,833
AND SOMEHOW I ENDED UP HERE.
WHAT HAPPENED TO ME?

260
00:17:13,916 --> 00:17:16,041
- YOU DON'T REMEMBER
WHAT HAPPENED?

261
00:17:16,125 --> 00:17:19,375
- MMM.
I DON'T REMEMBER ANYTHING.

262
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:24,125
- ( grunts )

263
00:17:24,208 --> 00:17:26,875
- OH! HE'S TOAST.

264
00:17:26,958 --> 00:17:30,500
- YIELD. DO AS I SAY.
I TOLD YOU ALREADY!

265
00:17:30,583 --> 00:17:33,083
YOU ARE MY ENEMY.

266
00:17:33,166 --> 00:17:35,750
AND I DON'T CARE
WHAT THAT SNOOTY BASTARD SAID--

267
00:17:35,833 --> 00:17:37,916
THAT IF I WANTED TO
SEE MOUTOKU AGAIN,

268
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,916
I'D HAVE TO GO WITH YOU?

269
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,375
WELL YOU'RE NOT USING HIM
JUST TO GET AT ME!

270
00:17:43,458 --> 00:17:46,333
DON'T EVEN TRY TO USE HIM
AS SORT OF BARGAINING CHIP

271
00:17:46,416 --> 00:17:47,875
TO MAKE ME DO WHAT YOU WANT!

272
00:17:51,958 --> 00:17:53,333
- TON-CHAN, NO!

273
00:17:53,416 --> 00:17:56,291
THOSE TOOLS ARE
YOUR MOST PRECIOUS POSSESSIONS!

274
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:58,166
- HUH?

275
00:18:06,541 --> 00:18:08,333
BASEBALL HAS THE GROUNDS.

276
00:18:08,416 --> 00:18:09,833
JUDO HAS THE DOJO.

277
00:18:09,916 --> 00:18:13,041
SO WHERE'S THE SACRED PLACE
FOR STREET FIGHTERS?

278
00:18:14,208 --> 00:18:16,250
- WHAT?
ARE YOU GIVING ME A RIDDLE?

279
00:18:16,333 --> 00:18:18,750
I'M VERY BAD AT THOSE THINGS
'CAUSE I'M KIND OF STUPID,

280
00:18:18,833 --> 00:18:19,916
YA KNOW?

281
00:18:23,458 --> 00:18:26,291
- THE STREET IS A VERY
SACRED PLACE FOR ALL OF US.

282
00:18:26,375 --> 00:18:28,291
DO YOU THINK IT'S OKAY
TO JUST LEAVE

283
00:18:28,375 --> 00:18:30,083
AFTER YOU'VE MESSED IT ALL UP?

284
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,791
( grunting )

285
00:18:34,875 --> 00:18:37,166
I REMEMBER NOW.

286
00:18:41,291 --> 00:18:43,208
THE MOST IMPORTANT RULE
OF BATTLE!

287
00:18:43,291 --> 00:18:45,625
AND THAT RULE IS--
HYAH!

288
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:47,958
--BASICS!

289
00:18:56,666 --> 00:18:59,083
KAKOUEN,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING

290
00:18:59,166 --> 00:19:01,250
MIXED UP WITH
THAT SNOOTY SON OF A BITCH?

291
00:19:01,333 --> 00:19:04,708
BUT IF HE'S RIGHT,

292
00:19:04,791 --> 00:19:08,166
AND MOUTOKU IS REALLY WAITING
AT KYOSHO ACADEMY,

293
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:10,000
THEN I WILL GO TO VISIT HIM.

294
00:19:10,083 --> 00:19:12,833
BUT ON MY OWN TERMS,
WHEN I'M GOOD AND READY.

295
00:19:12,916 --> 00:19:14,125
HUH?

296
00:19:20,625 --> 00:19:22,291
THANKS TO YOU,
MY MIND IS CLEAR

297
00:19:22,375 --> 00:19:24,750
AND I KNOW NOW WHAT'S IMPORTANT.
- HUH?

298
00:19:24,833 --> 00:19:28,458
- OKAY.
FIRST, APPLY THE PUTTY.

299
00:19:28,541 --> 00:19:30,875
MAKE SURE YOU GET IT
INTO ALL THE CRACKS.

300
00:19:30,958 --> 00:19:33,916
NEXT STEP-- YOU GOTTA SMOOTH
ALL OF IT OUT WITH YOUR TROWEL.

301
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,791
THEN MAKE SURE
YOU SAND DOWN THE EXCESS AND...

302
00:19:38,875 --> 00:19:40,208
FINISHED!

303
00:19:40,291 --> 00:19:43,041
- YUP, TON-CHAN'S
STILL A COMPLETE MORON.

304
00:19:43,125 --> 00:19:45,708
- BIG SISTER HAKUFU.
- HUH?

305
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:50,708
- LOOK AT WHAT I HAPPENED UPON.
- MOU-CHAN!  FU-CHIN!

306
00:19:50,791 --> 00:19:53,208
( giggles )
- SEE YA.

307
00:19:53,291 --> 00:19:56,250
- TON-CHAN.
YOU'RE LEAVING SO SOON?

308
00:19:56,333 --> 00:19:58,791
- I NEED TO GET TO KYOSHO.
I'M SURE THE REST OF THE

309
00:19:58,875 --> 00:20:00,958
ANSWERS I SEEK ARE ALL
WAITING FOR ME THERE.

310
00:20:01,041 --> 00:20:02,833
( stomach growls )

311
00:20:02,916 --> 00:20:04,500
- Sonken: SUN TZU TEACHES...
- HUH?

312
00:20:04,583 --> 00:20:07,750
- ...MORNING IS KEEN,
AFTERNOON FLAGS,

313
00:20:07,833 --> 00:20:10,416
AND EVENING FADES.
- WHAT?

314
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:13,708
- PEOPLE ARE FULL OF ENERGY WHEN
THEY WAKE UP IN THE MORNING,

315
00:20:13,791 --> 00:20:15,666
THEN IN THE AFTERNOON
THEY TIRE,

316
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:17,625
AND IN THE EVENING
THEY SEEK REST

317
00:20:17,708 --> 00:20:19,458
TO REPLENISH THEMSELVES.

318
00:20:19,541 --> 00:20:23,166
WHY NOT SHARE A MEAL WITH US
BEFORE YOU HEAD OUT ON YOUR WAY?

319
00:20:27,166 --> 00:20:30,000
- THAT WAS DELICIOUS.
THANKS.

320
00:20:30,083 --> 00:20:32,583
- DON'T YOU WANT TO SEE MY MAMA?
- WHAT?

321
00:20:32,666 --> 00:20:35,666
- BIG SISTER, WHAT WOULD HE
WANT TO SEE OUR MOTHER FOR?

322
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:37,291
- WHY WOULDN'T HE
WANT TO SEE HER?

323
00:20:37,375 --> 00:20:38,541
HE IS HER BOYFRIEND, AFTER ALL.

324
00:20:38,625 --> 00:20:41,125
- OH!  HUH?

325
00:20:41,208 --> 00:20:43,125
MMM.

326
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:46,166
MOTHER HAS A BOYFRIEND?

327
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:49,125
- Goei: A-CHOO!
- ( objects rustling )

328
00:20:49,208 --> 00:20:51,875
- OH, I DROPPED EVERYTHING.

329
00:20:51,958 --> 00:20:54,333
- Koukin:
ARE YOU OKAY, AUNT GOEI?

330
00:20:54,416 --> 00:20:56,166
YOU'RE NOT FEELING SICK,
ARE YOU?

331
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:57,708
- NO, I'M NOT SICK.

332
00:20:57,791 --> 00:21:00,916
SOMEONE'S JUST TALKING
ABOUT ME BEHIND MY BACK AGAIN.

333
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,750
MAYBE IT'S THAT YOUNG MAN
I MET!

334
00:21:02,833 --> 00:21:04,625
OR THAT MANAGER
OF THE DRUG STORE

335
00:21:04,708 --> 00:21:06,916
BY THE STATION
WHO'S SO WONDERFULLY MANLY.

336
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,875
OH, I BET HE'S MADLY IN LOVE
WITH ME AND WANTS TO PROPOSE!

337
00:21:09,958 --> 00:21:12,250
- YOU DON'T SAY.

338
00:21:12,333 --> 00:21:14,458
- MMM!

339
00:21:14,541 --> 00:21:16,041
YUMMY.

340
00:21:16,125 --> 00:21:19,625
- THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
- DO YOU THINK THAT--

341
00:21:19,708 --> 00:21:23,750
DOES FU-CHIN SEEM HAPPIER
THAN SHE DID BEFORE THIS?

342
00:21:23,833 --> 00:21:26,833
- YOU ALSO NOTICED HER CHANGE?
- YOU GUYS.

343
00:21:26,916 --> 00:21:29,291
WERE YOU TALKING ABOUT ME?

344
00:21:31,708 --> 00:21:34,500
SO CUTE.

345
00:21:47,625 --> 00:21:51,541
- ( theme music playing )

346
00:23:17,125 --> 00:23:19,541
- Kakouton: SAY, SONSAKU,
YOUR MOM AND ME,

347
00:23:19,625 --> 00:23:21,750
WE'RE NOT REALLY DATING
LIKE BOYFRIEND AND GIRLFRIEND,

348
00:23:21,833 --> 00:23:22,958
ARE WE?

349
00:23:23,041 --> 00:23:24,458
- Hakufu: OH, SURE YOU ARE.
ABSOLUTELY.

350
00:23:24,541 --> 00:23:27,750
YOU TWO ARE SO IN LOVE.
MAMA IS EVEN CARRYING YOUR BABY.

351
00:23:27,833 --> 00:23:29,791
- WHAT?!
SHE'S CARRYING MY--

352
00:23:29,875 --> 00:23:32,166
YOU'RE LYING!
I DON'T REMEMBER DOING THAT.

353
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:34,416
IMPOSSIBLE!
I'M NOT EVEN INTO COUGARS.

354
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:37,125
- Sonken: PLEASE CALM DOWN.
AFTER ALL, SUN TZU SAID,

355
00:23:37,208 --> 00:23:39,791
YOU SHOULD REAP WHAT YOU SOW
AND TAKE RESPONSIBILITY.

356
00:23:39,875 --> 00:23:41,291
- Hakufu:
HEY, HEY, HOLD ON A SECOND.

357
00:23:41,375 --> 00:23:44,333
I DON'T THINK SUN TZU
EVER SAID THAT.
