1
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:10,416
- ( theme music playing )

2
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,958
- ( singing in Japanese )

3
00:01:42,583 --> 00:01:44,291
- HOW'D YOU FIGURE OUT
THAT I WAS UP HERE?

4
00:01:44,375 --> 00:01:46,166
- YOU DISAPPEARED WITHOUT
A WORD TO ANYONE.

5
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:48,500
NOT THAT I HAVEN'T DONE
A BIT OF THAT TOO.

6
00:01:48,583 --> 00:01:51,083
AT FIRST, I HAD NO IDEA
WHERE YOU COULD HAVE GONE.

7
00:01:51,166 --> 00:01:53,416
BUT THEN SAJI SUGGESTED
YOU MIGHT HAVE JUST GONE

8
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:54,750
TO GET AWAY FROM IT ALL.

9
00:01:54,833 --> 00:01:57,500
- I KNEW IT.
- HUH?

10
00:01:57,583 --> 00:01:59,416
- YOU DID SPEAK TO HIM.

11
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:01,625
THAT DAY AT RAKUYO
YOU MET SAJI.

12
00:02:01,708 --> 00:02:03,583
YOU DON'T REMEMBER
WHAT HAPPENED?

13
00:02:03,666 --> 00:02:06,458
- MM.
I DON'T REMEMBER ANYTHING.

14
00:02:07,708 --> 00:02:09,583
- YOU LIED TO ME THAT DAY.

15
00:02:09,666 --> 00:02:11,416
AND THEN AT
THE AMUSEMENT PARK...

16
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:14,458
I SAW YOU LEAVE WITH HIM.

17
00:02:14,541 --> 00:02:17,416
YOU AND SAJI WERE IN CAHOOTS
FROM THE BEGINNING,

18
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:18,458
WEREN'T YOU?

19
00:02:18,541 --> 00:02:19,750
YOU'RE BEEN LYING
THE WHOLE TIME.

20
00:02:19,833 --> 00:02:22,208
- NO, IT WASN'T
LIKE THAT AT ALL.

21
00:02:22,291 --> 00:02:24,625
IT'S TRUE THAT SAJI AND I
HAVE BEEN MEETING EACH OTHER

22
00:02:24,708 --> 00:02:25,833
BEHIND YOUR BACK.

23
00:02:25,916 --> 00:02:27,208
HE ASKED ME TO LIE A LITTLE,

24
00:02:27,291 --> 00:02:29,208
BUT KEEPING IT A SECRET WAS
MY CHOICE.

25
00:02:29,291 --> 00:02:31,875
I SWEAR.
I JUST DIDN'T WANNA HURT YOU.

26
00:02:31,958 --> 00:02:33,791
- YOU DIDN'T WANNA HURT ME?

27
00:02:40,625 --> 00:02:43,041
- I FIGURED OUT YOU HAVE
FEELINGS FOR SAJI.

28
00:02:43,125 --> 00:02:46,250
AND HE TOLD ME YOU TWO
USED TO DATE.

29
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:48,916
IT WAS SO HARD FOR YOU
TO TALK TO ME ABOUT HIM,

30
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,916
BECAUSE YOU WERE AFRAID HE AND I
MIGHT GET BACK TOGETHER.

31
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,583
SAJI ASKED ME
NOT TO TELL YOU

32
00:02:53,666 --> 00:02:55,083
THAT HE AND I HAD BEEN
MEETING UP.

33
00:02:55,166 --> 00:02:57,416
HE DIDN'T WANT YOU TO GET
THE WRONG IDEA.

34
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,666
I PROMISE.
WE'RE JUST FRIENDS.

35
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:01,708
EVEN IF MY MEMORY DOES
FULLY RETURN,

36
00:03:01,791 --> 00:03:03,708
WE WON'T GO BACK
TO BEING A COUPLE.

37
00:03:03,791 --> 00:03:05,458
HE SAID YOU'RE
VERY SPECIAL TO HIM.

38
00:03:05,541 --> 00:03:08,500
AND I CAN TELL HE'LL NEVER HAVE
EYES FOR ANYONE ELSE BUT YOU.

39
00:03:08,583 --> 00:03:10,333
- YEAH, THEN WHY IS
THAT BASTARD

40
00:03:10,416 --> 00:03:12,458
ALWAYS RUNNING OFF
AND DISAPPEARING ON ME?

41
00:03:12,541 --> 00:03:16,000
- SAJI IS WORKING TO UNRAVEL THE
MYSTERY OF HOW I'M STILL ALIVE

42
00:03:16,083 --> 00:03:18,291
AND WHY I CAN'T REMEMBER.

43
00:03:18,375 --> 00:03:20,583
HE SAYS HE CAN'T SEE YOU
UNTIL IT'S SOLVED.

44
00:03:20,666 --> 00:03:22,166
SAJI THOUGHT THAT SAFER.

45
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:23,250
- BASTARD.

46
00:03:23,333 --> 00:03:24,958
HE COULD HAVE
AT LEAST CALLED ME.

47
00:03:25,041 --> 00:03:26,166
- ( giggles )

48
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:28,125
- WHAT ARE YOU LAUGHING ABOUT?

49
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:29,875
- ISN'T THAT A TYPICAL GUY,
THOUGH?

50
00:03:29,958 --> 00:03:31,708
SINCE THEY CAN'T JUST
PICK UP THE PHONE.

51
00:03:31,791 --> 00:03:34,041
MEN SUCK AT COMMUNICATING.

52
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:43,291
BUT A GUY'S FLAWS DON'T MATTER
WHEN YOU'RE IN LOVE, DO THEY?

53
00:03:43,375 --> 00:03:45,083
- UH, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU MEAN.

54
00:03:45,166 --> 00:03:46,416
- DON'T DENY IT.

55
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,125
SAJI REALLY CARES
FOR YOU TOO.

56
00:03:48,208 --> 00:03:51,000
HE JUST DOESN'T SAY IT BECAUSE
HE'S NOT THAT KIND OF GUY.

57
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:56,125
I TOLD HIM NOT TO WASTE
HIS TIME FIGURING THINGS OUT.

58
00:03:56,208 --> 00:03:58,375
I DON'T CARE ABOUT
MY PAST ANYMORE.

59
00:03:58,458 --> 00:03:59,666
- BUT YOUR MEMORIES--

60
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:01,833
- AREN'T IMPORTANT.
THE PAST IS THE PAST.

61
00:04:01,916 --> 00:04:04,416
WHAT MATTERS IS
WHAT'S HERE AND NOW.

62
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,958
EVER SINCE I MET YOU,
THE TIME WE'VE SPENT TOGETHER

63
00:04:07,041 --> 00:04:09,500
AS FRIENDS
HAS MEANT SO MUCH TO ME.

64
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:11,208
- FRIENDS?

65
00:04:12,708 --> 00:04:14,708
- WHEN I WENT BACK
 TO RAKUYO ACADEMY

66
00:04:14,791 --> 00:04:16,208
AND SAW THE RUINS
IT HAD BECOME,

67
00:04:16,291 --> 00:04:18,083
IT MADE ME REALIZE SOMETHING.

68
00:04:18,166 --> 00:04:19,916
THAT PLACE WAS DARK AND COLD.

69
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,916
I WAS AFRAID THERE.

70
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,083
BUT WHEN I'M WITH YOU...

71
00:04:24,166 --> 00:04:25,625
I FEEL WARM AND ACCEPTED,

72
00:04:25,708 --> 00:04:28,291
LIKE THE DARKNESS IN MY PAST
NO LONGER HOLDS ME PRISONER,

73
00:04:28,375 --> 00:04:30,125
AND I AM SET FREE.

74
00:04:30,208 --> 00:04:31,791
THAT'S WHY...

75
00:04:31,875 --> 00:04:34,750
- WHY WHAT?

76
00:04:34,833 --> 00:04:37,083
- THE LAST THING
I WOULD EVER WANT IS TO COME

77
00:04:37,166 --> 00:04:38,750
BETWEEN YOU AND SAJI.

78
00:04:38,833 --> 00:04:40,833
AND IF I'M DOING THAT
JUST BY BEING HERE,

79
00:04:40,916 --> 00:04:44,041
THEN I THINK I KNOW
WHAT I HAVE TO DO.

80
00:04:44,125 --> 00:04:45,541
I LOVE YOU, RYOMOU.

81
00:04:45,625 --> 00:04:47,541
AND I CAN'T BEAR
AT THE THOUGHT OF YOU HATING ME

82
00:04:47,625 --> 00:04:49,916
ANYMORE THAN YOU ALREADY DO.

83
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,541
THAT'S WHY I'M GOING TO LEAVE.

84
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:53,541
AND YOU'RE NEVER GONNA
SEE ME AGAIN.

85
00:04:53,625 --> 00:04:55,000
GOOD-BYE, MY FRIEND.

86
00:04:55,083 --> 00:04:56,125
- WAIT!

87
00:05:02,791 --> 00:05:04,500
I DON'T WANT YOU TO GO.

88
00:05:06,083 --> 00:05:08,166
- DOES THAT MEAN
YOU TRUST ME AGAIN?!

89
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:09,750
OH!
( giggles )

90
00:05:09,833 --> 00:05:10,875
- WAIT.  NO.  STOP.

91
00:05:10,958 --> 00:05:12,125
- YOU'RE MY BEST FRIEND.

92
00:05:12,208 --> 00:05:13,791
I PROMISE
I'LL NEVER HIDE ANYTHING

93
00:05:13,875 --> 00:05:14,791
FROM YOU AGAIN.

94
00:05:22,166 --> 00:05:24,041
- ( giggles )

95
00:05:27,333 --> 00:05:29,416
- Koukin:
IT WAS MISS RYOFU'S DOING?

96
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:32,375
- UH-HUH.
THAT'S WHAT RYUU-CHAN SAID.

97
00:05:35,416 --> 00:05:37,750
- ( Ryuubi sobbing )

98
00:05:37,833 --> 00:05:40,125
- Hakufu:
IT'LL BE OKAY, RYUU-CHAN.

99
00:05:40,208 --> 00:05:41,583
PLEASE STOP CRYING.

100
00:05:41,666 --> 00:05:42,916
DON'T WORRY.

101
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,708
THEIR WOUNDS AREN'T
LIFE-THREATENING.

102
00:05:44,791 --> 00:05:45,708
- BUT--

103
00:05:45,791 --> 00:05:47,875
- CALM DOWN.
HOW DID IT START?

104
00:05:47,958 --> 00:05:50,250
- THE OTHER DAY,
MISS RYOFU INVITED

105
00:05:50,333 --> 00:05:53,708
KAN'U AND ME TO GO
TO THE AMUSEMENT PARK.

106
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:57,375
MISS RYOFU AND I
WENT INTO THE HAUNTED HOUSE.

107
00:05:57,458 --> 00:06:00,041
AND THEN SHE--

108
00:06:00,125 --> 00:06:01,583
- AND THEN SHE WHAT?

109
00:06:01,666 --> 00:06:04,083
- ( sobbing )
IT'S TOO HORRIBLE!

110
00:06:04,166 --> 00:06:06,708
- DON'T LOOK AT ME.
I WASN'T THERE.

111
00:06:08,875 --> 00:06:11,250
- I WAS LYING DOWN 
AND SHE TOUCHED ME.

112
00:06:11,333 --> 00:06:12,750
SOMETHING HAPPENED.

113
00:06:12,833 --> 00:06:14,375
AND THEN SHE TOOK OVER.

114
00:06:14,458 --> 00:06:16,333
AND ALL OF THIS IS
ALL MY FAULT!

115
00:06:16,416 --> 00:06:18,333
( screams )

116
00:06:23,375 --> 00:06:25,875
- IT SOUNDS LIKE
SHE WAS POSSESSED.

117
00:06:25,958 --> 00:06:26,875
( gasps )

118
00:06:26,958 --> 00:06:30,375
- WELL, I DON'T REALLY REMEMBER.

119
00:06:30,458 --> 00:06:31,875
- ( gasps )

120
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:34,041
- HUH?  ARE YOU OKAY?

121
00:06:34,125 --> 00:06:36,208
- ( gasps )
UH, YEAH, I'M FINE.

122
00:06:36,291 --> 00:06:37,708
BUT WE SHOULD PROBABLY
GET GOING.

123
00:06:37,791 --> 00:06:39,333
- ( gasps )

124
00:06:42,416 --> 00:06:44,375
CHUBO WAS DEFINITELY
ACTING STRANGELY

125
00:06:44,458 --> 00:06:46,166
WHEN WE LAST SAW RYOFU.

126
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:48,083
DID SHE SENSE SOMETHING?

127
00:06:48,166 --> 00:06:50,250
WHAT HAD HER SO SCARED?

128
00:06:50,333 --> 00:06:53,000
- KOUKIN!
LET'S GO FIND FUU-CHIN!

129
00:06:53,083 --> 00:06:54,041
- YES, BUT--

130
00:06:54,125 --> 00:06:56,333
- DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME.
- All: HUH?

131
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:57,875
- Hakufu: RIKU-CHAN.

132
00:06:57,958 --> 00:07:00,708
- Sonken:
MR. GAKUSHU, WHO IS THAT?

133
00:07:00,791 --> 00:07:03,708
- HAKUGEN RIKUSON,
OUR ACADEMY'S STRATEGIST.

134
00:07:03,791 --> 00:07:06,375
- HOUSEN RYOFU LEFT
RYOMOU'S PLACE A WHILE AGO.

135
00:07:06,458 --> 00:07:08,125
SHE'S NOT EVEN IN TOWN.

136
00:07:08,208 --> 00:07:09,958
BUT REGARDLESS,
SHE'S NOT HERSELF.

137
00:07:10,041 --> 00:07:11,666
SOMEONE IS MANIPULATING HER.

138
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:13,833
- SHE'S POSSESSED TOO?
BY WHO?

139
00:07:13,916 --> 00:07:15,708
- CAN YOU TELL US ANYTHING,
RIKUSON?

140
00:07:17,458 --> 00:07:18,916
- IT'S GENPOU SAJI.

141
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,333
- HE'S DOING THIS?!
BUT WHY?!

142
00:07:21,416 --> 00:07:23,916
- THE PERSON YOU KNOW
AS SAJI IS SAJI,

143
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,583
BUT HE'S ALSO NOT SAJI.

144
00:07:25,666 --> 00:07:27,000
- HUH?

145
00:07:27,083 --> 00:07:30,333
- Gakushu: THE GUY'S REAL
NAME IS SHISHI OUIN.

146
00:07:30,416 --> 00:07:33,041
GENPOU SAJI WAS AN ALIAS
USED TO GET CLOSE TO

147
00:07:33,125 --> 00:07:34,375
AND DEFEAT TOUTAKU.

148
00:07:34,458 --> 00:07:36,416
- UH, I'M SORRY.

149
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:38,166
COULD YOU TRY PUTTING THAT
A DIFFERENT WAY?

150
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:39,458
'CAUSE I REALLY DIDN'T GET IT.

151
00:07:39,541 --> 00:07:42,250
- THERE ARE TWO PEOPLE
NAMED GENPOU SAJI.

152
00:07:42,333 --> 00:07:44,416
THERE'S THE ONE WE KNOW
AND THE OTHER WE DON'T.

153
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:45,083
IS THAT RIGHT?

154
00:07:45,166 --> 00:07:46,250
- MM-HMM.

155
00:07:49,208 --> 00:07:51,083
- ( distant siren blaring )

156
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:58,708
- Shisonzui: YOUNG MASTER.

157
00:07:58,791 --> 00:08:00,541
- ( footsteps approaching )

158
00:08:00,625 --> 00:08:02,291
- DON'T PUT THAT ON.

159
00:08:02,375 --> 00:08:03,458
- SHISONZUI.

160
00:08:03,541 --> 00:08:05,708
- IT'S TOO SOON TO WEAR
THAT SACRED BEAD.

161
00:08:05,791 --> 00:08:08,083
DON'T RETURN TO BEING OUIN
JUST YET.

162
00:08:08,166 --> 00:08:11,750
- BUT BOTH TOUTAKU AND RYOFU
 OF RAKUYO ACADEMY ARE DEAD.

163
00:08:11,833 --> 00:08:13,916
WHAT REASON IS THERE
TO CONTINUE LIVING MY LIFE

164
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,666
AS MY ASSUMED IDENTITY?

165
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:16,833
- DESTINY.

166
00:08:16,916 --> 00:08:19,125
AFTER SHISHI OUIN OF
THE THREE KINGDOMS

167
00:08:19,208 --> 00:08:20,791
DEFEATED HIS ENEMY TOUTAKU,

168
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:22,750
HE FELL VICTIM TO
A HORRIBLE FATE. 

169
00:08:22,833 --> 00:08:25,416
TRAITORS FROM WITHIN
HIS OWN COMMAND

170
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,083
ROSE UP AND KILLED HIM.

171
00:08:27,166 --> 00:08:29,583
- Past Ouin: I AM OUIN!

172
00:08:32,166 --> 00:08:34,083
- THAT PRECISELY WHY
I MUST RETURN

173
00:08:34,166 --> 00:08:35,583
TO BEING SHISHI OUIN.

174
00:08:35,666 --> 00:08:38,083
I MUST ACCOMPLISH 
WHAT HE COULD NOT.

175
00:08:38,166 --> 00:08:39,958
LIVE WHERE HE DIED.

176
00:08:40,041 --> 00:08:42,208
- AND YOU CAN.
BUT NOT YET.

177
00:08:42,291 --> 00:08:44,875
REMEMBER WHEN YOU ASSUMED
THE GUISE OF GENPOU SAJI,

178
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:46,416
YOU TOOK ON MORE THAN
JUST A NAME.

179
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:47,833
- MEANING WHAT?

180
00:08:47,916 --> 00:08:50,791
- GENPOU SAJI HAD HIS OWN PART
TO PLAY IN THAT ERA.

181
00:08:50,875 --> 00:08:52,458
HE FORETOLD SOUSOU'S DEATH,

182
00:08:52,541 --> 00:08:54,458
THEN CONJURED AN
ARMY OF CORPSES.

183
00:08:54,541 --> 00:08:56,458
- Past Saji:
WHEN CLAY MICE

184
00:08:56,541 --> 00:08:59,125
CHASE GOLDEN TIGERS...

185
00:08:59,208 --> 00:09:02,291
GUAN YU WILL LIVE NO MORE.

186
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,291
- ( screams, groans )

187
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,750
- ARE YOU SAYING THAT BEFORE
I CAN BE OUIN AGAIN,

188
00:09:11,833 --> 00:09:13,833
I MUST FIGURE OUT A WAY
TO RAISE THE DEAD?

189
00:09:13,916 --> 00:09:15,625
- THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEANT.

190
00:09:15,708 --> 00:09:18,500
ONE DAY, THE REAL REINCARNATION
OF GENPOU SAJI

191
00:09:18,583 --> 00:09:21,125
WILL INHERIT THE SACRED BEAD
AND WITH IT HIS FATE.

192
00:09:21,208 --> 00:09:23,958
HE WILL COME TO KANTO.
AND WHEN THAT HAPPENS,

193
00:09:24,041 --> 00:09:25,625
YOU MUST SEEK OUT
THIS MAGICIAN...

194
00:09:25,708 --> 00:09:29,666
AND DESTROY HIM
OR SUFFER HIS DESTINY.

195
00:09:39,166 --> 00:09:41,250
- DAMN IT!
K.O.'d AGAIN?

196
00:09:41,333 --> 00:09:42,916
- WELL WELL WELL...

197
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,583
THE MIGHTY MOU-CHAN, INVINCIBLE
MASTER OF JOINT LOCKS,

198
00:09:45,666 --> 00:09:47,583
GETS HER ASS
HANDED TO HER AGAIN.

199
00:09:47,666 --> 00:09:50,125
- HEY, LAY OFF.
I'M JUST NOT IN THE ZONE TODAY.

200
00:09:50,208 --> 00:09:52,291
I CAN BEAT THIS ONE.
- YEAH, SURE YOU CAN.

201
00:09:52,375 --> 00:09:53,916
COME ON,
LET'S DO SOMETHING ELSE.

202
00:09:55,583 --> 00:09:57,500
THIS LOOKS FUN.
HOW ABOUT SOME PICTURES?

203
00:09:57,583 --> 00:10:00,000
- UH... NO.

204
00:10:00,083 --> 00:10:02,000
I COULDN'T.
IT'S JUST TOO EMBARRASSING.

205
00:10:02,083 --> 00:10:04,166
- YOU THINK IT'S SILLY?
- NO.

206
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:05,750
THAT'S NOT IT.

207
00:10:05,833 --> 00:10:07,666
- OKAY, WE'LL DO SOMETHING ELSE.

208
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:10,708
CHANGE YOUR MIND?

209
00:10:10,791 --> 00:10:13,083
COME ON, YOU KNOW YOU WANT TO.

210
00:10:16,208 --> 00:10:17,458
WHY SO SERIOUS?

211
00:10:17,541 --> 00:10:18,458
GIVE US A SMILE.

212
00:10:18,541 --> 00:10:19,541
- STOP THAT!

213
00:10:19,625 --> 00:10:21,125
HUH?  OH!

214
00:10:21,208 --> 00:10:22,958
- ( camera shutter clicks )

215
00:10:23,041 --> 00:10:26,458
- HEY!  WHEN DID I TELL YOU
IT WAS ALL RIGHT

216
00:10:26,541 --> 00:10:28,375
TO STICK THIS
TO MY CELLPHONE?!

217
00:10:28,458 --> 00:10:30,041
- AHH, YOU REALLY
DON'T LIKE IT?

218
00:10:30,125 --> 00:10:32,791
- UH, WELL, NOBODY SAID
ANYTHING LIKE THAT.

219
00:10:32,875 --> 00:10:34,458
- OKAY, I'LL PEEL IT OFF THEN.

220
00:10:34,541 --> 00:10:36,250
- LEAVE IT!
IT'S FINE.

221
00:10:36,333 --> 00:10:38,541
ANYHOW...

222
00:10:38,625 --> 00:10:39,916
TODAY WAS NICE.

223
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,916
- HMM?
I DIDN'T QUITE CATCH THAT.

224
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,750
MIND SAYING IT ONE MORE TIME?

225
00:10:43,833 --> 00:10:44,875
- JERK!  SHUT UP!

226
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:47,375
FINE!
I HAD FUN TODAY, ALL RIGHT?

227
00:10:47,458 --> 00:10:50,000
BYE, SAJI!
SEE YOU TOMORROW.

228
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:52,500
- LATER, MOU-CHAN.

229
00:10:52,583 --> 00:10:55,166
- I FOUND YOU.

230
00:10:57,458 --> 00:10:58,625
- HERE AT LAST.

231
00:11:00,041 --> 00:11:02,125
GENPOU SAJI.

232
00:11:04,541 --> 00:11:06,541
MOUTOKU SOUSOU IS GONE.

233
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:09,916
SO WHAT REASON DO YOU HAVE
TO MATERIALIZE HERE NOW?

234
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,791
- SHIMEI RYOMOU.

235
00:11:12,875 --> 00:11:16,583
I WANT THE DRAGON THAT IS
LYING DORMANT INSIDE OF HER.

236
00:11:16,666 --> 00:11:17,750
- ( exhales )

237
00:11:17,833 --> 00:11:21,083
WHAT DO YOU WANT
WITH HER DRAGON?

238
00:11:21,166 --> 00:11:22,375
- LOOK AT ME.

239
00:11:23,583 --> 00:11:27,666
- I HAD NEVER SEEN
SUCH SAD EYES.

240
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:31,000
LONELINESS, DESPAIR,
RESENTMENT.

241
00:11:31,083 --> 00:11:34,416
THOSE PITIABLE EYES THAT NEVER
EVEN GLIMPSED ANYTHING ELSE.

242
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,750
WHY ARE YOU TELLING ME THIS?

243
00:11:36,833 --> 00:11:38,500
I'M NOT GOING TO HELP YOU.

244
00:11:38,583 --> 00:11:41,500
- OH, BUT YOU ARE GOING TO 
HELP ME ACHIEVE MY DESIRES.

245
00:11:41,583 --> 00:11:43,916
I AM CERTAIN OF IT.
- OH, REALLY?

246
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,291
SCREW YOU,
YOU HACK FORTUNE TELLER.

247
00:11:46,375 --> 00:11:47,916
YOUR CRYSTAL BALL IS WRONG.

248
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,583
- I CAN RETURN SOMETHING
THAT YOU LOST,

249
00:11:50,666 --> 00:11:53,250
A PART OF YOUR PAST
THAT WAS QUITE DEAR TO YOU.

250
00:11:53,333 --> 00:11:55,208
- A PART OF MY PAST?

251
00:12:10,958 --> 00:12:13,041
- THIS CAN'T... BE POSSIBLE.

252
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:18,541
HOUSEN RYOFU.

253
00:12:18,625 --> 00:12:20,458
IS THIS REAL?

254
00:12:20,541 --> 00:12:23,416
CAN YOU ACTUALLY BRING
A PERSON BACK TO LIFE?

255
00:12:26,791 --> 00:12:27,958
RYOFU!

256
00:12:28,041 --> 00:12:29,666
IT'S ME!
IT'S SAJI!

257
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:31,416
I'M RIGHT HERE.

258
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:34,250
- I WAS ABLE TO RESTORE HER, 
BUT SHE IS STILL NOT WHOLE...

259
00:12:34,333 --> 00:12:35,750
YET.

260
00:12:35,833 --> 00:12:38,166
HER MEMORIES DID NOT
RETURN WITH HER.

261
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:40,500
THAT WILL REQUIRE
A BIT MORE TIME. 

262
00:12:45,458 --> 00:12:48,250
- HEY!

263
00:12:50,416 --> 00:12:51,750
WHAT'S HAPPENING?

264
00:12:51,833 --> 00:12:53,708
- ( both grunting )

265
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:55,958
- HUH!

266
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:57,833
- HAS HER MEMORY BEEN RESTORED?

267
00:12:57,916 --> 00:13:00,041
- NOT COMPLETELY.
MUCH IS STILL MISSING.

268
00:13:00,125 --> 00:13:01,916
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

269
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,083
WHY IS SHE FIGHTING?

270
00:13:03,166 --> 00:13:04,833
- RYOFU IS A FIGHTER.

271
00:13:04,916 --> 00:13:06,833
HE INSTINCTS SENSED
ANOTHER NEARBY

272
00:13:06,916 --> 00:13:07,958
AND TOOK CONTROL OF HER.

273
00:13:08,041 --> 00:13:09,333
- LIKE A REFLEX?

274
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,708
RYOFU, PULL YOURSELF TOGETHER.

275
00:13:20,791 --> 00:13:23,500
- A FIGHTER'S INSTINCT IS
FRIGHTENINGLY POWERFUL.

276
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:25,666
FOR MOST, THE INSTINCT IS
FIGHT OR FLIGHT,

277
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:27,875
BUT SHE HAS NO CHOICE
EXCEPT TO FIGHT

278
00:13:27,958 --> 00:13:30,208
UNTIL SHE GETS
HER MEMORY BACK,

279
00:13:30,291 --> 00:13:32,333
OR THE BATTLES KILL HER.

280
00:13:32,416 --> 00:13:34,125
- THEN I'LL FIND HER MEMORY.

281
00:13:34,208 --> 00:13:35,791
- HOW WILL YOU DO THAT?

282
00:13:35,875 --> 00:13:38,541
- BY USING RYOMOU.
- SHIMEI RYOMOU?

283
00:13:38,625 --> 00:13:42,291
- RYOFU ONCE ENTRUSTED MOU-CHAN
WITH HER DEEPEST SECRET.

284
00:13:42,375 --> 00:13:44,000
JUST HER.

285
00:13:44,083 --> 00:13:45,166
WITHOUT HER MEMORIES,

286
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:47,333
RYOFU IS LITTLE MORE
THAN AN EMPTY SHELL.

287
00:13:47,416 --> 00:13:49,333
RYOMOU WOULD NEVER JUST
LEAVE HER LIKE THIS.

288
00:13:49,416 --> 00:13:52,166
- AND YOU THINK SHE CAN
UNLOCK RYOFU'S PAST?

289
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:54,333
- YES.

290
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:56,125
AT LEAST IT'S POSSIBLE.

291
00:13:56,208 --> 00:13:58,458
RYOFU AND RYOMOU...

292
00:13:58,541 --> 00:14:00,125
ARE BOTH FIGHTERS.

293
00:14:01,791 --> 00:14:03,791
UNFORTUNATELY...

294
00:14:03,875 --> 00:14:06,166
RYOFU'S MEMORIES
DIDN'T SEEM TO BE COMING BACK.

295
00:14:07,666 --> 00:14:09,291
I TRIED AGAIN.

296
00:14:09,375 --> 00:14:12,833
I TOOK A DANGEROUS RISK
AND WENT TO SEE HER.

297
00:14:12,916 --> 00:14:16,125
I EVEN TOLD HER OUTRIGHT
THAT WE HAD BEEN LOVERS ONCE.

298
00:14:21,708 --> 00:14:23,583
BUT IT WAS USELESS.

299
00:14:23,666 --> 00:14:26,916
TO RYOFU, THE MEMORIES OF
HER PAST LIFE AS A FIGHTER 

300
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,875
WERE THE BARS OF A CAGE 
THAT HAD IMPRISONED HER.

301
00:14:29,958 --> 00:14:32,208
AND DEEP DOWN,
ALL HER SOUL HAD EVER WANTED

302
00:14:32,291 --> 00:14:34,166
WAS TO BE FREE.

303
00:14:36,291 --> 00:14:38,166
- ( children playing )

304
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:44,166
- ( girl giggling )

305
00:14:46,041 --> 00:14:47,666
- HEY!

306
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:50,500
WHAT'S SO FUNNY, FREAK SHOW?

307
00:14:50,583 --> 00:14:54,458
- ( laughs ) I BET SHE WAS ABOUT
TO EAT THAT STUPID BUTTERFLY.

308
00:14:54,541 --> 00:14:57,083
- SHE HAS TO EAT BUGS
 'CAUSE SHE'S CREEPY.

309
00:14:57,166 --> 00:14:59,041
- ( boys laughing )

310
00:15:05,583 --> 00:15:06,458
- ( gasps )

311
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:14,166
- GO ON, EAT IT.

312
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:17,041
- ( boys laughing )

313
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:18,625
- NOT HUNGRY?

314
00:15:18,708 --> 00:15:20,375
BUT I CAUGHT IT
JUST FOR YOU.

315
00:15:20,458 --> 00:15:22,500
WELL, ALL RIGHT,
IF YOU DON'T WANT IT...

316
00:15:22,583 --> 00:15:23,500
( grunts )

317
00:15:23,583 --> 00:15:25,000
- ( cries )

318
00:15:25,083 --> 00:15:26,958
- ( boys laughing )

319
00:15:29,916 --> 00:15:33,041
- Girl #1: ISN'T THAT THE FREAK
WITH ALL THOSE WEIRD POWERS?

320
00:15:33,125 --> 00:15:34,666
- Girl #2: I HEAR THAT WEIRDO

321
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:37,041
MADE BAD THINGS
HAPPEN TO AN OLDER KID.

322
00:15:37,125 --> 00:15:38,541
- ( grunts )

323
00:15:38,625 --> 00:15:40,875
- IT-- IT'S HERE.
IT'S LOOKING AT US.

324
00:15:40,958 --> 00:15:43,458
- LEAVE US ALONE.
- A MONSTER!  LET'S GET IT.

325
00:15:43,541 --> 00:15:45,708
- WAIT, DON'T DO IT.

326
00:15:48,791 --> 00:15:49,916
- THAT HURT.

327
00:15:51,291 --> 00:15:52,541
- Boy #1: GO AWAY!

328
00:15:52,625 --> 00:15:55,416
- Boy #2:
STOP BREATHING OUR AIR!

329
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:57,083
- Boy #3: YOU'RE DISGUSTING!

330
00:15:57,166 --> 00:15:58,291

YOU MAKE ME SICK!

331
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:05,750
- Boy #3: NICE SHOT!
- Boy #2: BEAT IT ALREADY!

332
00:16:05,833 --> 00:16:07,750
SCRAM!

333
00:16:18,958 --> 00:16:21,791
WHA-- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!
AAH!

334
00:16:21,875 --> 00:16:22,875
- Boy #1: STOP IT! 
- ( blows landing )

335
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:23,875
- Boy #3: MY ARM!

336
00:16:23,958 --> 00:16:26,250
IT'S MOVING BY ITSELF!

337
00:16:26,333 --> 00:16:27,583
- Girl #1:
MY BODY WON'T LET ME RUN AWAY!

338
00:16:27,666 --> 00:16:29,750
- ( children screaming, crying )

339
00:16:29,833 --> 00:16:31,916
- Girl #3:
STOP IT!  PLEASE!

340
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,875
WHAT ARE YOU DOING THIS?

341
00:16:35,166 --> 00:16:37,041
- ( gasping )

342
00:16:43,833 --> 00:16:46,916
OUIN.

343
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,166
DON'T LEAVE ME BY MYSELF.

344
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:51,750
STAY BY MY SIDE, OUIN.

345
00:16:51,833 --> 00:16:54,083
PROMISE YOU'LL HELP ME
GET WHAT I WANT.

346
00:16:54,166 --> 00:16:56,541
- OKAY.

347
00:16:56,625 --> 00:16:59,541
- ( crying )

348
00:16:59,625 --> 00:17:02,166
- AND THAT'S HER.
THE REAL GENPOU SAJI,

349
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:03,250
THE NECROMANCER.

350
00:17:03,333 --> 00:17:06,041
- SO, YOU'RE SAYING THAT
THE REAL SAJI

351
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:07,541
FIRST POSSESSED FUU-CHIN,

352
00:17:07,625 --> 00:17:09,625
THEN USED HER TO PUT A SPELL
ON RYUU-CHAN,

353
00:17:09,708 --> 00:17:11,375
SO SHE COULD GO BACK
TO SATO ACADEMY

354
00:17:11,458 --> 00:17:13,416
AND MAKE EVERYONE THERE FIGHT?

355
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,500
- YEP, IT SEEMS LIKE
 YOU FINALLY GOT IT.

356
00:17:15,583 --> 00:17:17,250
- AHEM.
I UNDERSTAND.

357
00:17:17,333 --> 00:17:20,083
THAT MEANS THE REAL BAD GUY IS
THAT WITCH GIRL SAJI, RIGHT?

358
00:17:20,166 --> 00:17:22,083
- ( gasps )
- I'M GONNA GO THERE!

359
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:24,791
- UM, BIG SISTER?

360
00:17:24,875 --> 00:17:27,291
- WHERE ARE YOU GOING TO GO?
- ISN'T IT OBVIOUS?

361
00:17:27,375 --> 00:17:29,791
TO SEE SAJI,
THE NECROPHILIAC.

362
00:17:29,875 --> 00:17:31,791
SHE CAN'T BE ALLOWED
TO CONTINUE.

363
00:17:31,875 --> 00:17:33,291
SHE MUST BE STOPPED.

364
00:17:33,375 --> 00:17:36,166
- Rikuson: DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
WHERE TO FIND HER?

365
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:38,541
- BUT RIKU-CHAN,
I THOUGHT YOU KNEW.

366
00:17:38,625 --> 00:17:40,416
- OF COURSE I DON'T.
I'M NOT PSYCHIC.

367
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,375
- Hakufu: WHY NOT?
- Rikuson: HEY.

368
00:17:42,458 --> 00:17:44,041
DO YOU KNOW HOW HARD
IT WAS TO GET EVEN

369
00:17:44,125 --> 00:17:44,833
THIS MUCH INFORMATION?

370
00:17:44,916 --> 00:17:47,041
- CHUBO.

371
00:17:47,125 --> 00:17:49,000
- ( rain falling )
- HUH?

372
00:17:50,375 --> 00:17:52,250
IT'S RAINING.

373
00:18:01,125 --> 00:18:03,041
- ( door opens )

374
00:18:07,958 --> 00:18:08,916
- RYOFU?

375
00:18:32,083 --> 00:18:34,708
- Ryofu: EVEN IF MY MEMORY
DOES FULLY RETURN,

376
00:18:34,791 --> 00:18:36,708
WE WON'T GO BACK
TO BEING A COUPLE.

377
00:18:36,791 --> 00:18:38,375
HE SAID YOU'RE VERY SPECIAL
TO HIM.

378
00:18:38,458 --> 00:18:40,625
AND I CAN TELL HE'LL NEVER
HAVE EYES FOR ANYONE ELSE,

379
00:18:40,708 --> 00:18:43,541
BUT YOU.

380
00:18:43,625 --> 00:18:45,208
THE PAST IS THE PAST.

381
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:47,375
WHAT MATTERS IS
WHAT'S HERE AND NOW.

382
00:18:47,458 --> 00:18:50,375
EVER SINCE I MET YOU,
THE TIME WE'VE SPENT TOGETHER

383
00:18:50,458 --> 00:18:52,291
AS FRIENDS
HAS MEANT SO MUCH TO ME.

384
00:18:52,375 --> 00:18:55,125
DOES THAT MEAN
YOU TRUST ME AGAIN?!

385
00:18:55,208 --> 00:18:56,916
( giggles )

386
00:19:09,916 --> 00:19:11,750
- ( gasps )

387
00:19:15,333 --> 00:19:16,416
SAJI.

388
00:19:17,708 --> 00:19:18,625
- ( chuckles )

389
00:19:18,708 --> 00:19:20,625
- ( gasps )

390
00:19:25,708 --> 00:19:26,791
LIAR!

391
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:29,625
( grunts, shouts )

392
00:19:37,625 --> 00:19:38,916
- RAGE.

393
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,916
THAT IS THE SOURCE
OF THE DRAGON'S POWER.

394
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,583
- RYOFU, YOU HAVE
DOUBLE-CROSSED AND DECEIVED ME.

395
00:19:45,666 --> 00:19:48,208
BUT I REMEMBER
WHAT YOU TOLD ME ONCE

396
00:19:48,291 --> 00:19:52,208
EVEN IF YOU DO NOT.

397
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:54,541
- THE SACRED BEADS
LOCK US INTO A HISTORY

398
00:19:54,625 --> 00:19:56,250
WE MUST REPEAT.

399
00:19:56,333 --> 00:19:57,500
BUT I FOUGHT AGAINST IT.

400
00:19:57,583 --> 00:19:59,000
AND THOUGH IT COST ME DEARLY,

401
00:19:59,083 --> 00:20:00,416
I SUCCEEDED.

402
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:03,250
THAT'S RIGHT.
I CHANGED MY FATE.

403
00:20:03,333 --> 00:20:05,958
MY DEATH IS MY CHOICE.

404
00:20:06,041 --> 00:20:07,750
- I, TOO...

405
00:20:07,833 --> 00:20:09,416
CAN ALTER MY DESTINY.

406
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:10,708
IT'S MY CHOICE!

407
00:20:10,791 --> 00:20:12,666
AND I CHOOSE...

408
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:14,125
TO KILL YOU!

409
00:20:14,208 --> 00:20:16,000
AAH!

410
00:20:22,708 --> 00:20:24,166
- HOW DARE YOU?

411
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:26,833
YOU DISGUST ME, RYOMOU.

412
00:20:32,916 --> 00:20:35,000
- ( groans )

413
00:20:35,083 --> 00:20:37,041
( crying )

414
00:20:39,291 --> 00:20:41,208
( screaming )

415
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,083
- MOU-CHAN?

416
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:53,041
- ( thunder rumbles )

417
00:21:01,041 --> 00:21:02,916
- ( continues crying )

418
00:21:27,958 --> 00:21:30,208
- SHIMEI RYOMOU...

419
00:21:30,291 --> 00:21:33,541
YOUR FATE WILL NEVER BE
YOUR OWN CHOICE.

420
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:35,541
THAT IS YOUR DESTINY

421
00:21:35,625 --> 00:21:37,375
BECAUSE OF WHO YOU ARE.

422
00:21:37,458 --> 00:21:39,500
YOU ARE THE FIGHTER
WITH THE DRAGON.

423
00:21:47,166 --> 00:21:48,916
- ( theme music playing )

424
00:22:08,166 --> 00:22:10,541
- ( singing in Japanese )

425
00:23:19,333 --> 00:23:20,416
- MISS RIKUSON,

426
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:22,791
PLEASE ALLOW ME
TO INTRODUCE MYSELF.

427
00:23:22,875 --> 00:23:24,291
I AM CHUBO SONKEN.

428
00:23:24,375 --> 00:23:26,958
- I CAN'T BELIEVE SONSAKU
HAS A LITTLE SISTER LIKE YOU.

429
00:23:27,041 --> 00:23:28,833
YOU'RE COURTEOUS
AND POLITE.

430
00:23:28,916 --> 00:23:31,750
WHILE SONSAKU, ON THE OTHER
HAND, IS LAZY, STUPID, SELFISH--

431
00:23:31,833 --> 00:23:33,916
BASICALLY AN ALL-AROUND
TERRIBLE LEADER.

432
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,916
- Hakufu: WHAT DID
YOU SAY?! HEY, MISSY!

433
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,125
WHICH ONE OF US IS
THE MAIN CHARACTER HERE?

434
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:41,125
- Chubo: BIG SISTER, I THINK
MISS RIKUSON IS JUST UPSET

435
00:23:41,208 --> 00:23:43,708
THAT SHE HASN'T SHOWN UP
UNTIL THIS LATE IN THE SERIES.
