1
00:00:08,333 --> 00:00:10,250
- ( theme music playing )

2
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:22,875
- ( singing in Japanese )

3
00:01:38,583 --> 00:01:40,833
- WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY
IS THAT MY NAME

4
00:01:40,916 --> 00:01:42,458
ISN'T CHUBO SONKEN.

5
00:01:42,541 --> 00:01:43,625
- Hakufu and Koukin:
HUH?

6
00:01:43,708 --> 00:01:45,666
- I'M NOT WHO YOU THINK I AM.

7
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:48,166
I'M NOT ACTUALLY EVEN
YOUR YOUNGER SISTER. 

8
00:01:50,083 --> 00:01:51,000
- Both: HUH?

9
00:01:51,083 --> 00:01:52,375
- IT'S TIME YOU KNEW.

10
00:01:52,458 --> 00:01:54,625
MY REAL NAME IS
ACTUALLY SHOUKYOU.

11
00:01:54,708 --> 00:01:56,875
- WAIT.
YOU'RE SHOUKYOU?

12
00:01:56,958 --> 00:01:58,875
- WHAT'S THE MATTER, KOUKIN?

13
00:01:58,958 --> 00:02:00,750
- THAT MEANS
IF YOU'RE SHOUKYOU,

14
00:02:00,833 --> 00:02:02,208
THEN I'M...

15
00:02:02,291 --> 00:02:04,375
- YOUR DESTINY,
IT'S TRUE.

16
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:06,041
ONE DAY,
I AM DESTINED

17
00:02:06,125 --> 00:02:07,750
TO BE WED TO MY BETROTHED,

18
00:02:07,833 --> 00:02:09,000
KOUKIN SHUYUU.

19
00:02:09,083 --> 00:02:12,166
- SO YOU TWO--
YOU'RE GOING TO--

20
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:13,625
WHOA!

21
00:02:13,708 --> 00:02:15,541
IN THE FUTURE,
YOU'RE...

22
00:02:15,625 --> 00:02:16,541
( gasps )

23
00:02:16,625 --> 00:02:18,958
...MARRIED?!

24
00:02:19,041 --> 00:02:20,958
IS WHAT SHE SAID TRUE,
KOUKIN?

25
00:02:21,041 --> 00:02:22,625
- I DON'T KNOW.
IT MIGHT BE TRUE FOR

26
00:02:22,708 --> 00:02:24,958
THE KOUKIN SHUYUU OF
THE THREE KINGDOMS BACK THEN,

27
00:02:25,041 --> 00:02:26,458
BUT FOR ME HERE AND NOW?

28
00:02:26,541 --> 00:02:29,125
I JUST DON'T--

29
00:02:29,208 --> 00:02:30,958
- I TOTALLY GET IT!

30
00:02:31,041 --> 00:02:33,000
I MEAN, I HAD NO IDEA THAT
YOU WERE INVOLVED

31
00:02:33,083 --> 00:02:34,125
WITH THIS KIND OF PERSON.

32
00:02:34,208 --> 00:02:36,250
CONGRATULATIONS.

33
00:02:36,333 --> 00:02:37,750
I GUESS THERE'S HOPE
THAT ONE DAY

34
00:02:37,833 --> 00:02:39,333
YOU MIGHT BECOME A MAN.
- HEY!

35
00:02:39,416 --> 00:02:41,750
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO WAS ALWAYS
ACTING LIKE AN IMMATURE KID.

36
00:02:41,833 --> 00:02:43,250
STUPID.
- COME ON!

37
00:02:43,333 --> 00:02:45,083
THERE'S NO REASON TO BE
CALLING ME STUPID.

38
00:02:45,166 --> 00:02:47,708
THE ONE WHO SAYS STUPID FIRST
IS REALLY STUPID.

39
00:02:47,791 --> 00:02:49,541
- YOU KNOW,
SAYING STUPID THINGS LIKE THAT

40
00:02:49,625 --> 00:02:50,916
MAKES PEOPLE CALL YOU STUPID.

41
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,625
- WHAT'S THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN?!

42
00:02:52,708 --> 00:02:54,125
- STUPID!
- ( Shoukyou giggles )

43
00:02:54,208 --> 00:02:56,791
- IT MEANS EXACTLY
WHAT YOU THINK IT MEANS.

44
00:02:56,875 --> 00:02:57,833
AHEM.

45
00:02:57,916 --> 00:03:00,000
SO, I GUESS
THE FIRST QUESTION IS:

46
00:03:00,083 --> 00:03:02,791
WHY DID YOU FEEL YOU HAD TO
LIE TO US ABOUT YOUR REAL NAME?

47
00:03:02,875 --> 00:03:05,000
- WELL...

48
00:03:10,166 --> 00:03:13,166
- WHAT BROUGHT THIS UP,
SHOUKYOU?

49
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:16,375
- I HAVE BEEN DESTINED TO BECOME
THE WIFE OF KOUKIN SHUYUU

50
00:03:16,458 --> 00:03:18,875
SINCE THE DAY I WAS BORN.

51
00:03:18,958 --> 00:03:20,875
MY FUTURE HUSBAND IS OUT THERE.

52
00:03:20,958 --> 00:03:24,541
ALL I WANT IS TO MEET THE MAN
I'M DESTINED TO MARRY.

53
00:03:24,625 --> 00:03:27,166
IS THAT REALLY SO UNREASONABLE?

54
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:28,375
- OF COURSE NOT.

55
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:30,500
BUT THE TWO OF YOU ARE
STILL QUITE YOUNG.

56
00:03:30,583 --> 00:03:33,000
SHUYUU IS NOT YET MATURE ENOUGH
FOR SUCH NEWS.

57
00:03:33,083 --> 00:03:34,916
IF HE LEARNS
WHO YOU TRULY ARE,

58
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,458
IT IS QUITE LIKELY
TO FLUSTER HIM INTO FOOLISHNESS.

59
00:03:37,541 --> 00:03:41,625
- EVEN SO, ALL I WANT IS
TO CATCH A GLIMPSE OF HIM,

60
00:03:41,708 --> 00:03:44,958
AND MAYBE THE CHANCE TO SPEAK
WITH HIM FOR A BIT AS WELL.

61
00:03:46,583 --> 00:03:47,833
- ( sighs )

62
00:03:50,208 --> 00:03:51,875
FINE, WE'LL TRY.

63
00:03:51,958 --> 00:03:53,666
I WILL GO TO HIS RESIDENCE,

64
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:56,208
AND SHALL HAVE A TALK
WITH HIS AUNT GOEI.

65
00:03:56,291 --> 00:03:58,333
- REALLY, MASTER CHOUSHOU?

66
00:03:58,416 --> 00:03:59,875
- REALLY.

67
00:03:59,958 --> 00:04:02,000
HOWEVER,
FOR THIS TO HAPPEN,

68
00:04:02,083 --> 00:04:03,958
YOU MUST NOT MEET SHUYUU
AS SHOUKYOU.

69
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:07,833
- AND THAT WAS IT.

70
00:04:07,916 --> 00:04:12,208
I'M SORRY FOR LYING,
FOR DECEIVING BOTH OF YOU.

71
00:04:12,291 --> 00:04:13,416
( sobs )

72
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,833
- NO, IT'S OKAY.
WE'RE NOT MAD AT YOU.

73
00:04:15,916 --> 00:04:19,333
IT'S JUST-- WHY DID YOU SUDDENLY
DECIDE TO TELL THE TRUTH?

74
00:04:21,833 --> 00:04:23,000
( gasps )

75
00:04:25,791 --> 00:04:27,750
- BECAUSE I REALIZE
THAT THERE'S SOMEONE

76
00:04:27,833 --> 00:04:29,833
FAR MORE SUITABLE FOR YOU,

77
00:04:29,916 --> 00:04:31,750
SOMEONE THAT YOU'RE
ALREADY CLOSE TO.

78
00:04:31,833 --> 00:04:33,916
- HUH?  UH.

79
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,833
- HUH?

80
00:04:35,916 --> 00:04:37,875
SOMEBODY CLOSE TO KOUKIN?

81
00:04:37,958 --> 00:04:39,541
WHERE?  WHERE?

82
00:04:39,625 --> 00:04:40,750
WHERE?!

83
00:04:40,833 --> 00:04:43,208
WHERE COULD THIS PERSON BE?
- ( sighs )

84
00:04:43,291 --> 00:04:45,291
- ( giggles )
MISS SONSAKU.

85
00:04:45,375 --> 00:04:46,833
- HOLD ON!

86
00:04:46,916 --> 00:04:49,250
WHAT'S WITH ALL THIS SUDDEN
MISS SONSAKU STUFF OUT OF YOU?

87
00:04:49,333 --> 00:04:50,458
- UH...

88
00:04:50,541 --> 00:04:52,708
-TO ME, YOU ARE AND
WILL ALWAYS BE CHUBO.

89
00:04:52,791 --> 00:04:54,541
YOU ARE MY LITTLE SISTER

90
00:04:54,625 --> 00:04:56,333
AND MY VERY DEAR FRIEND.

91
00:04:56,416 --> 00:04:58,666
I NEED YOU TO KEEP CALLING ME
BIG SISTER HAKUFU

92
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:00,291
LIKE YOU ALWAYS DO,
OR OTHERWISE,

93
00:05:00,375 --> 00:05:03,375
I'M GONNA GET
TOTALLY CONFUSED.

94
00:05:03,458 --> 00:05:06,583
- SO YOU'RE...
STILL BIG SISTER HAKUFU?

95
00:05:06,666 --> 00:05:08,041
- THAT GOES FOR ME TOO.

96
00:05:08,125 --> 00:05:10,875
YOU'RE STILL CHUBO.
IS THAT OKAY WITH YOU?

97
00:05:10,958 --> 00:05:13,875
- THANK YOU,
BIG BROTHER KOUKIN.

98
00:05:13,958 --> 00:05:16,000
- WELL, I BETTER GET GOING.

99
00:05:16,083 --> 00:05:18,500
- GET GOING WHERE?
 WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

100
00:05:18,583 --> 00:05:20,458
- WAIT.
YOU'RE NOT PLANNING TO--

101
00:05:20,541 --> 00:05:22,458
- I AM.
I'M GOING TO RAKUYO

102
00:05:22,541 --> 00:05:24,458
TO FIND THE REAL GENPOU SAJI.

103
00:05:24,541 --> 00:05:26,208
AND I'LL FIND MOU-CHAN TOO.

104
00:05:26,291 --> 00:05:27,791
- HAKUFU.

105
00:05:27,875 --> 00:05:29,250
I'M COMING TOO.

106
00:05:29,333 --> 00:05:31,750
- KOUKIN, YOU'RE HURT.

107
00:05:31,833 --> 00:05:33,750
- I'M FINE.
IT'S JUST A SCRATCH.

108
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:35,750
JUST KNOW...

109
00:05:35,833 --> 00:05:37,833
I'VE GOT YOUR BACK.
I PROMISE.

110
00:05:37,916 --> 00:05:41,083
- KOUKIN.

111
00:05:41,166 --> 00:05:43,250
YOU'RE ACTING
REALLY STRANGE TODAY.

112
00:05:43,333 --> 00:05:44,541
SO WEIRD.

113
00:05:44,625 --> 00:05:46,000
- BIG SISTER,

114
00:05:46,083 --> 00:05:48,583
I'M DEEPLY GRATEFUL
FOR EVERYTHING YOU'VE DONE

115
00:05:48,666 --> 00:05:51,333
TO PROVE YOUR FRIENDSHIP
AND MAKE ME FEEL CARED FOR.

116
00:05:51,416 --> 00:05:55,166
I KNOW THAT BOTH OF YOU CARE
FOR RYOMOU LIKE YOU CARE FOR ME,

117
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:58,416
AND I WANT THE CHANCE TO SHOW
THAT SHE IS DEAR TO ME AS WELL.

118
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,750
AND THAT'S WHY,
MUCH LIKE BIG BROTHER,

119
00:06:00,833 --> 00:06:02,791
I'D LIKE YOU TO TAKE ME
ALONG TOO.

120
00:06:02,875 --> 00:06:05,208
- NO WAY.
I KNOW HOW YOU FEEL,

121
00:06:05,291 --> 00:06:07,500
BUT IT'S DANGEROUS.

122
00:06:07,583 --> 00:06:09,333
- ALL RIGHT.
- HUH?

123
00:06:09,416 --> 00:06:11,791
- CHUBO, KOUKIN,
LET'S DO THIS!

124
00:06:11,875 --> 00:06:14,791
TOGETHER WE'LL HAVE 
THE STRENGTH OF 100!

125
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:16,291
- THANKS, BIG SISTER.

126
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:18,291
- ( deeply sighs )

127
00:06:18,375 --> 00:06:19,958
WELL, SINCE YOU MADE UP
YOUR MIND,

128
00:06:20,041 --> 00:06:22,250
I DON'T SUPPOSE
THERE'S ANY POINT IN ARGUING.

129
00:06:22,333 --> 00:06:24,791
MY TWO SISTERS ARE
A PIECE OF WORK.

130
00:06:24,875 --> 00:06:26,375
- ( both laugh )

131
00:06:26,458 --> 00:06:27,916
- NOW THAT I THINK ABOUT IT,

132
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,583
CHUBO NOTICED THAT SOMETHING
WAS WRONG WITH RYOFU

133
00:06:30,666 --> 00:06:32,541
BEFORE ANYONE ELSE DID.

134
00:06:34,458 --> 00:06:36,125
- WHY ARE YOU GIVING US
THAT WEIRD LOOK?

135
00:06:36,208 --> 00:06:37,958
- WHAT?  THERE WASN'T
ANY KIND OF LOOK.

136
00:06:38,041 --> 00:06:41,250
- Hakufu: ALL RIGHT, EVERYONE,
LET'S GO DO THIS!

137
00:06:44,958 --> 00:06:47,375
- TO ZHUGE LIANG I PRAY.

138
00:06:47,458 --> 00:06:49,916
IF BY TENTON
I CAN MOVE THE CLOUDS.

139
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,375
FILLING THEM WITH WIND,

140
00:06:51,458 --> 00:06:54,083
SO THAT THEY MIGHT FLY
ACROSS THE SKY.

141
00:06:54,166 --> 00:06:57,750
IF BY CHITON I COULD BURROW
BENEATH THE MOUNTAINS

142
00:06:57,833 --> 00:07:00,208
AND PASS THROUGH THE BOULDERS.

143
00:07:00,291 --> 00:07:03,875
IF BY JINTON
I COULD ERASE MY PRESENCE

144
00:07:03,958 --> 00:07:05,708
AND CHANGE MY FORM.

145
00:07:05,791 --> 00:07:08,500
IF I COULD SEND MY SWORD
FLYING THROUGH THE AIR, 

146
00:07:08,583 --> 00:07:11,500
COMMANDING IT TO BRING ME
THE HEAD OF MY ENEMIES,

147
00:07:11,583 --> 00:07:14,625
THEN I WOULD ASK
MY PRAYERS BE ANSWERED.

148
00:07:16,458 --> 00:07:19,750
- ( all panting )

149
00:07:19,833 --> 00:07:21,375
( gasping )

150
00:07:28,458 --> 00:07:29,458
- TON-CHAN!

151
00:07:29,541 --> 00:07:31,833
- SHE'S DANGEROUS!
STAY BACK!

152
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,583
- IS THAT MYOUSAI KAKOUEN?

153
00:07:42,666 --> 00:07:43,750
- LOOKS LIKE HER.

154
00:07:43,833 --> 00:07:45,166
BUT IT SURE DOESN'T
ACT LIKE HER.

155
00:07:49,875 --> 00:07:52,291
- Koukin: SHE'S UNDER THE
INFLUENCE OF GENPOU SAJI.

156
00:07:52,375 --> 00:07:53,875
- Kakouton: WHAT?

157
00:07:53,958 --> 00:07:57,208
- THIS IS ALL GENPOU SAJI'S PLAN
 TO DESTROY TRUST IN EACH OTHER.

158
00:07:57,291 --> 00:07:59,375
SHE'S USING HER POWER
TO MANIPULATE OUR FRIENDS.

159
00:07:59,458 --> 00:08:00,750
- I KNOW SAJI.

160
00:08:00,833 --> 00:08:02,541
STUCK-UP, BLOND SON OF A BITCH.

161
00:08:02,625 --> 00:08:05,166
- OH, NO, WE'RE NOT TALKING
ABOUT THAT SAJI.

162
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:07,125
THIS IS A TOTALLY DIFFERENT
GIRL SAJI,

163
00:08:07,208 --> 00:08:08,875
WHO'S, LIKE, ALL MAGICAL
AND STUFF.

164
00:08:08,958 --> 00:08:10,208
SHE KIDNAPPED MOU-CHAN

165
00:08:10,291 --> 00:08:12,541
AND MADE EVERYONE
AT SATO ACADEMY ACT CRAZY.

166
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:14,916
AND SHE EVEN POSSESSED ME!
- HUH?

167
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,541
- BUT MAYBE WE SHOULD
TAKE CARE OF HER FIRST.

168
00:08:23,875 --> 00:08:25,041
- LET'S DO THIS!

169
00:08:25,125 --> 00:08:26,041
( grunts )

170
00:08:27,583 --> 00:08:28,666
- TON-CHAN!

171
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:29,708
- STAY BACK!

172
00:08:29,791 --> 00:08:31,500
( straining ) 
I'M NOT SAYING

173
00:08:31,583 --> 00:08:33,083
THIS IS THE BEST IDEA,

174
00:08:33,166 --> 00:08:34,541
BUT THAT WITCH--

175
00:08:34,625 --> 00:08:36,208
SHE PUT A SPELL ON MY FRIEND.

176
00:08:36,291 --> 00:08:38,875
AND THERE'S NO WAY I'M GONNA 
IGNORE A FRIEND WHO NEEDS ME.

177
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:41,625
EVEN IF I HAVE TO RISK
GETTING HURT TO DO SO.

178
00:08:41,708 --> 00:08:43,958
NOW, AS FOR YOU GUYS,

179
00:08:44,041 --> 00:08:46,541
DON'T YOU HAVE A FRIEND 
WHO NEEDS YOUR HELP TOO?

180
00:08:46,625 --> 00:08:49,083
- BUT--
- THEN GET MOVING!

181
00:08:49,166 --> 00:08:50,500
BUT DO ME ONE FAVOR.

182
00:08:50,583 --> 00:08:53,208
BEAT THE WITCH SAJI
RIGHT INTO THE GROUND!

183
00:08:53,291 --> 00:08:56,041
- ( gasps )
IT'S ALL WRONG.

184
00:08:56,125 --> 00:08:57,208
DESPITE EVERYTHING,

185
00:08:57,291 --> 00:08:59,125
THEY'RE STILL TRYING TO
HELP EACH OTHER.

186
00:08:59,208 --> 00:09:00,958
- HAKUFU, GO ON AHEAD.

187
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:02,791
I'LL STAY AND HELP
DEAL WITH THIS.

188
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:03,791
- KOUKIN.

189
00:09:03,875 --> 00:09:06,125
RYOMOU'S WAITING FOR YOU.

190
00:09:06,208 --> 00:09:07,291
- MM.

191
00:09:07,375 --> 00:09:09,000
LET'S MOVE OUT, CHUBO.

192
00:09:09,083 --> 00:09:12,208
- RIGHT.
BE CAREFUL, BIG BROTHER.

193
00:09:12,291 --> 00:09:13,583
- YOU BE CAREFUL TOO.

194
00:09:13,666 --> 00:09:15,125
- THANKS.

195
00:09:15,208 --> 00:09:17,458
- KAKOUTON!

196
00:09:17,541 --> 00:09:19,458
SO, LOOKS LIKE YOU COULD
USE SOME HELP.

197
00:09:19,541 --> 00:09:20,500
- JUST WATCH YOUR BACK.

198
00:09:23,041 --> 00:09:25,208
OR YOU'LL END UP
GETTING HURT AGAIN!

199
00:09:25,291 --> 00:09:28,125
- ( crying )

200
00:09:28,208 --> 00:09:30,333
I WILL NOT LOSE.

201
00:09:30,416 --> 00:09:32,375
NOT TO ANYONE.

202
00:09:32,458 --> 00:09:35,583
I CAN RELY ON MYSELF.

203
00:09:35,666 --> 00:09:37,083
ONLY IN MYSELF.

204
00:09:38,458 --> 00:09:39,375
MYSELF.

205
00:09:49,083 --> 00:09:52,875
- HEY!  MOU-CHAN!

206
00:09:52,958 --> 00:09:56,333
JUST CALL OUT IF YOU CAN
HEAR ME, MOU-CHAN!

207
00:09:56,416 --> 00:09:59,500
WHERE ARE YOU, MOU-CHAN?!

208
00:09:59,583 --> 00:10:01,791
- THEY'RE HERE.

209
00:10:01,875 --> 00:10:04,625
- MISS RYOMOU!
( echoing )

210
00:10:15,708 --> 00:10:19,541
- FROM THIS MOMENT FORTH,
 YOU WILL BECOME A BEAST,

211
00:10:19,625 --> 00:10:21,666
A VESSEL FOR MY RAGE.

212
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:24,333
IN MY NAME,
YOU WILL SAVAGE THEM ALL.

213
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:27,625
A BLOODTHIRSTY BEAST
UNTIL YOUR DYING BREATH.

214
00:10:27,708 --> 00:10:30,541
FIGHTERS...

215
00:10:30,625 --> 00:10:33,375
I WISH...

216
00:10:33,458 --> 00:10:37,041
THEY'D ALL...

217
00:10:37,125 --> 00:10:39,750
- Ryofu: JUST DIE.

218
00:10:47,458 --> 00:10:48,375
- ( gasps )

219
00:10:54,833 --> 00:10:56,875
FUU-CHIN!

220
00:11:09,416 --> 00:11:10,791
- FUU-CHIN.

221
00:11:10,875 --> 00:11:14,416
- BIG SISTER, MISS RYOFU IS
BEING CONTROLLED BY SAJI.

222
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:18,291
- THIS HOSEN RYOFU IS NOTHING
LIKE THE GIRL YOU KNEW.

223
00:11:18,375 --> 00:11:21,625
SHE IS ANGER AND HATRED
INCARNATE,

224
00:11:21,708 --> 00:11:24,791
A LONG DEAD SOUL
RAGING AGAINST HER FATE.

225
00:11:24,875 --> 00:11:27,291
A BEAST THAT WILL
BRING NOTHING

226
00:11:27,375 --> 00:11:29,250
BUT PAIN AND DEATH
TO YOU ALL.

227
00:11:29,333 --> 00:11:30,750
( shouting )

228
00:11:30,833 --> 00:11:32,416
- CHUBO, RUN!

229
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,500
HUH!

230
00:11:34,583 --> 00:11:35,708
( grunts )

231
00:11:38,541 --> 00:11:39,416
( gasps )

232
00:11:40,625 --> 00:11:41,708
( groans )

233
00:11:41,791 --> 00:11:42,708
AAH.

234
00:11:42,791 --> 00:11:44,583
( screams )

235
00:11:44,666 --> 00:11:45,583
- BIG SISTER!

236
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:50,500
- ( groaning )
FUU-CHIN.

237
00:11:55,791 --> 00:11:56,666
AAH!

238
00:12:03,416 --> 00:12:04,958
- ARE YOU OKAY? 
- ( wind gusts )

239
00:12:05,041 --> 00:12:05,958
- ( both gasp )

240
00:12:06,041 --> 00:12:07,166
- LOOK OUT!

241
00:12:11,208 --> 00:12:12,208
( grunts )

242
00:12:26,208 --> 00:12:27,666
- ( grunts )

243
00:12:29,458 --> 00:12:31,541
- FUU-CHIN... WHY?

244
00:12:35,083 --> 00:12:36,500
WHY?!

245
00:12:36,583 --> 00:12:39,166
I DON'T WANNA FIGHT THIS WAY!

246
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:41,416
STOP IT!

247
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:44,333
- PLEASE, BIG SISTER,
 YOU MUSTN'T DO THIS.

248
00:12:44,416 --> 00:12:47,500
THE MORE YOU LASH OUT IN ANGER,
THE MORE POWERFUL THE ANGER

249
00:12:47,583 --> 00:12:50,000
THAT'S CONTROLLING HER
SOUL IS GOING TO BECOME.

250
00:12:50,083 --> 00:12:52,833
- CHUBO... HELP ME.

251
00:12:52,916 --> 00:12:54,708
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO?!

252
00:12:54,791 --> 00:12:57,208
I DON'T KNOW HOW
I'M SUPPOSED TO STOP HER.

253
00:12:59,083 --> 00:13:01,125
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO!

254
00:13:01,208 --> 00:13:05,791
- I WILL WATCH AS YOU BREAK
AND REND EACH OTHER.

255
00:13:05,875 --> 00:13:07,875
ALL THE PAIN
THAT I HAVE SUFFERED,

256
00:13:07,958 --> 00:13:10,750
I HAVE BARELY BEGUN
TO UNLEASH IT UPON YOU.

257
00:13:10,833 --> 00:13:13,250
WE'VE JUST BEGUN.

258
00:13:13,333 --> 00:13:15,500
( groaning )

259
00:13:15,583 --> 00:13:20,083
- THE POWER YOU WIELD IS
BEGINNING TO TAKE ITS TOLL

260
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:22,583
ON YOUR FRAIL PHYSICAL FORM.

261
00:13:22,666 --> 00:13:25,083
TO WIELD THE POWER
TO DESTROY OTHERS,

262
00:13:25,166 --> 00:13:27,166
YOU MUST IN TURN,
DESTROY YOURSELF.

263
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:28,500
- WHAT OF IT?!

264
00:13:28,583 --> 00:13:30,416
WHY EXACTLY SHOULD I CARE?!

265
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:34,416
SOON, THE POWER OF THE DRAGON
WILL BE MINE.

266
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,250
AND THEN--

267
00:13:36,333 --> 00:13:38,875
AND THEN I'LL MAKE
THE FIGHTERS SUFFER.

268
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:40,250
ALL OF THEM.

269
00:13:40,333 --> 00:13:42,916
I'LL MAKE THEM ALL DISAPPEAR.

270
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,583
YOU AND I,

271
00:13:44,666 --> 00:13:47,250
WE'RE THE ONLY ONES
WHO WILL REMAIN.

272
00:13:47,333 --> 00:13:49,083
THAT'S ALL I WANT.

273
00:13:49,166 --> 00:13:50,250
JUST YOU.

274
00:13:50,333 --> 00:13:53,583
YOU, AND NO ONE ELSE LEFT.

275
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:55,208
- SO WHAT REASON DO YOU HAVE

276
00:13:55,291 --> 00:13:56,750
TO MATERIALIZE HERE NOW?

277
00:13:56,833 --> 00:13:59,125
- SHIMEI RYOMOU.

278
00:13:59,208 --> 00:14:02,958
I WANT THE DRAGON THAT IS
LYING DORMANT INSIDE OF HER.

279
00:14:03,041 --> 00:14:05,083
- IT IS THE DRAGON'S NATURE

280
00:14:05,166 --> 00:14:08,458
TO CONSUME THE FIGHTER
IN WHICH ITS SPIRIT RESIDES.

281
00:14:08,541 --> 00:14:11,291
THE CORRUPTING POWER
WOULD SPREAD MISFORTUNE

282
00:14:11,375 --> 00:14:12,916
AND BREED DESTRUCTION.

283
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,750
BUT IF IT CAN BE CONTROLLED,

284
00:14:15,833 --> 00:14:19,208
PERHAPS IT COULD BE THE PERFECT
WEAPON AGAINST GENPOU SAJI,

285
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:22,083
SEALING AWAY THE POWER FOREVER.

286
00:14:22,166 --> 00:14:25,583
- Saji:
THE POWER OF THE DRAGON.

287
00:14:26,958 --> 00:14:30,083
- WATCH ME, OUIN.

288
00:14:30,166 --> 00:14:33,333
WATCH ME AS MY POWER
BRINGS CHAOS AND MISFORTUNE

289
00:14:33,416 --> 00:14:35,416
TO THE FIGHTERS
WHO STAND AGAINST US.

290
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:38,083
- I THINK YOU'VE DONE ENOUGH,
GENPOU SAJI.

291
00:14:38,166 --> 00:14:40,041
- ( gasps )

292
00:14:40,125 --> 00:14:42,166
- WITH THE WEAKENED STATE
YOU'RE IN NOW,

293
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:44,416
THE DRAGON'S POWER
WOULD OVERWHELM YOU.

294
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,250
- WHY TELL ME THIS NOW?

295
00:14:46,333 --> 00:14:48,750
- I SUPPOSE IT'S TIME TO BE
 HONEST ABOUT A FEW THINGS.

296
00:14:48,833 --> 00:14:51,916
I DIDN'T HELP YOU BECAUSE
I WANTED TO BRING RYOFU BACK.

297
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,750
I THOUGHT OF A WAY TO REMOVE
YOUR POWERS USING RYOMOU,

298
00:14:54,833 --> 00:14:57,916
WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY
PROTECTING RYOMOU FROM YOU.

299
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,250
- ( exhales )

300
00:14:59,333 --> 00:15:01,000
- THAT CAN'T BE TRUE.

301
00:15:01,083 --> 00:15:03,375
WHY ARE YOU LYING TO ME?

302
00:15:03,458 --> 00:15:05,708
YOU PUT ON AN ACT
IN ORDER TO ANGER RYOMOU

303
00:15:05,791 --> 00:15:07,375
AND AWAKEN THE DRAGON.

304
00:15:07,458 --> 00:15:09,291
EVERYTHING THAT'S HAPPENED
SINCE THEN,

305
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:11,291
YOU'RE SAYING IT WAS
ALL PART OF YOUR PLAN?

306
00:15:11,375 --> 00:15:15,416
- YOU POSSESSED THE POWER TO
BRING RYOFU BACK TO LIFE.

307
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,750
I FEARED YOU MIGHT
DESTROY RYOMOU

308
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:19,875
IN ORDER TO
ACHIEVE YOUR GOALS.

309
00:15:19,958 --> 00:15:21,958
THEREFORE, I PRETENDED
TO COOPERATE

310
00:15:22,041 --> 00:15:23,166
TO STAY CLOSE TO YOU

311
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:24,708
AND ENSURE
YOU DIDN'T KILL HER.

312
00:15:24,791 --> 00:15:26,500
- BUT YOU PROMISED ME!

313
00:15:26,583 --> 00:15:28,333
YOU SAID
YOU WOULDN'T LEAVE ME!

314
00:15:28,416 --> 00:15:31,875
YOU SAID YOU WERE MY FRIEND.

315
00:15:31,958 --> 00:15:35,708
- THE SOUL OF GENPOU SAJI
BURNS INSIDE OF YOU.

316
00:15:35,791 --> 00:15:37,041
TELL ME,

317
00:15:37,125 --> 00:15:38,875
WHAT GOOD COULD POSSIBLY
COME FROM HURTING OTHERS?

318
00:15:38,958 --> 00:15:41,666
IT'S FOOLISHNESS.
YOU CAN'T HOPE TO CONTROL

319
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:44,541
PEOPLE'S LIVES 
OR THEIR SOULS.

320
00:15:44,625 --> 00:15:47,250
IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,
I'M GOING TO GO PROVE MY POINT.

321
00:15:49,333 --> 00:15:51,000
- WAIT!
( gasps )

322
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:56,916
- AAH!

323
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,208
- BIG SISTER!
- AAH.

324
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:01,375
- NO, YOU HAVE TO
HANG IN THERE!

325
00:16:01,458 --> 00:16:04,041
PLEASE GET UP!
- OH, I WOULDN'T WORRY.

326
00:16:04,125 --> 00:16:06,125
SHE'S NOT GOING TO
GO DOWN THAT EASILY.

327
00:16:06,208 --> 00:16:07,125
- UH...

328
00:16:07,208 --> 00:16:08,875
- ( groaning )

329
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:10,708
- AAH!  HEY!

330
00:16:10,791 --> 00:16:13,125
HANDS OFF, YOU PERVERT!

331
00:16:13,208 --> 00:16:15,458
- HA!  IT'S FAKE SAJI!

332
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:16,916
- HEY, HOW'S IT GOING?

333
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,750
- HEY, WHERE THE HELL 
HAVE YOU BEEN HIDING?!

334
00:16:18,833 --> 00:16:21,250
THE REST OF US HAVE BEEN HAVING
A REALLY ROUGH TIME, YOU KNOW?!

335
00:16:21,333 --> 00:16:24,250
- THAT'S MY BAD.
SORRY ABOUT ALL THE TROUBLE.

336
00:16:24,333 --> 00:16:27,125
- SO THIS IS MR. SAJI
FROM NANYO?

337
00:16:27,208 --> 00:16:28,250
- THAT'S HIM.

338
00:16:28,333 --> 00:16:30,416
- IF IT'S ALL THE SAME,

339
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:34,208
I DO KIND OF HAVE A REAL
SERIOUS FAVOR TO ASK OF YOU.

340
00:16:34,291 --> 00:16:36,375
SAVE MOU-CHAN.

341
00:16:36,458 --> 00:16:38,541
AND WHILE YOU'RE AT IT,
SAVE THE OTHER ONE.

342
00:16:38,625 --> 00:16:39,916
- WHICH OTHER ONE?

343
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,916
- GENPOU SAJI.

344
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,250
I'M PRETTY YOU'VE MET.

345
00:16:45,333 --> 00:16:48,250
PLEASE, TRY TO WARM HER HEART--

346
00:16:48,333 --> 00:16:51,208
MADE FROZEN BY A CRUEL
AND CURSED FATE.

347
00:16:51,291 --> 00:16:53,375
- SO THAT'S WHO SHE WAS.

348
00:16:53,458 --> 00:16:56,375
- I HAVE FAITH THAT
YOU'RE UP TO THE JOB.

349
00:16:56,458 --> 00:16:59,208
- I'LL TRY.
BUT WHAT ABOUT FUU-CHIN?

350
00:16:59,291 --> 00:17:01,375
- IT'S ALL RIGHT.
I'LL TAKE CARE OF THAT PROBLEM.

351
00:17:01,458 --> 00:17:04,666
IT IS, AFTER ALL,
KIND OF MY MESS TO CLEAN UP.

352
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:11,250
- HEY, SAJI, YOUR HAIR!

353
00:17:11,333 --> 00:17:14,083
- IT'S NOT SAJI ANYMORE.

354
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:16,041
MY NAME IS SHISHI OUIN!

355
00:17:17,875 --> 00:17:18,875
- REMEMBER:

356
00:17:18,958 --> 00:17:20,958
SUN TZU TEACHES,
"IF YOU KNOW THE ENEMY

357
00:17:21,041 --> 00:17:22,958
AND YOU KNOW YOURSELF,
YOU NEED NOT FEAR

358
00:17:23,041 --> 00:17:24,666
THE RESULT OF
A HUNDRED BATTLES."

359
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:28,000
- SO GET GOING,
BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.

360
00:17:28,083 --> 00:17:30,250
- RIGHT, FAKE SAJI!

361
00:17:30,333 --> 00:17:33,083
- GO, AND USE YOUR POWER

362
00:17:33,166 --> 00:17:34,958
TO BRING FEELING BACK
INTO HER HEART.

363
00:17:35,041 --> 00:17:38,291
DO WHAT I FAILED TO DO.

364
00:17:38,375 --> 00:17:40,916
SAVE HER SOUL
THE WAY YOU ONCE SAVED MINE.

365
00:17:42,666 --> 00:17:44,916
NOW THEN...

366
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,750
- ( grunts )

367
00:17:46,833 --> 00:17:48,125
- SHUYUU!

368
00:17:48,208 --> 00:17:50,083
- DAMN IT.
IT'S NOT LIKE I'M DOING

369
00:17:50,166 --> 00:17:52,166
MUCH BETTER HERE.

370
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:53,833
- KAKOUTON,

371
00:17:53,916 --> 00:17:56,166
LISTEN NOW AND OBEY.

372
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:59,291
- ( groaning )

373
00:17:59,375 --> 00:18:01,083
- Sousou: OH, TON...
- ( gasps ) 

374
00:18:01,166 --> 00:18:05,125
- ...LOOKS LIKE YOU
 FORGOT THE BASICS.

375
00:18:05,208 --> 00:18:07,166
- ( exhales ) 
WHO SAID THAT?

376
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:08,250
( gasps )

377
00:18:08,333 --> 00:18:10,541
- IT CAN'T BE.

378
00:18:15,666 --> 00:18:16,708
- LOYAL ONE.

379
00:18:31,208 --> 00:18:32,583
KAKOUEN,

380
00:18:32,666 --> 00:18:34,583
DO YOU KNOW THE SOUND
OF MY VOICE?

381
00:18:39,458 --> 00:18:40,833
- I DO.

382
00:18:43,125 --> 00:18:44,750
- ( shouting )

383
00:18:53,583 --> 00:18:55,791
( grunting )

384
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:59,791
- DO YOU REMEMBER IT, RYOFU?

385
00:18:59,875 --> 00:19:01,916
DO YOU REMEMBER?

386
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,750
THE TIME WE SPENT TOGETHER?

387
00:19:04,833 --> 00:19:08,166
- ( shouts, grunting )

388
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:10,166
- I WANT YOU TO KNOW

389
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:11,833
YOUR PAST AS A FIGHTER.

390
00:19:11,916 --> 00:19:13,208
IF YOU BELIEVE ALL THE TIME

391
00:19:13,291 --> 00:19:16,541
YOU SPENT CHANGING
THAT FATE WAS SO SHAMEFUL,

392
00:19:16,625 --> 00:19:18,333
I WANT YOU TO KNOW
YOU'RE WRONG.

393
00:19:18,416 --> 00:19:21,833
YOU'RE A FIGHTER.
WE MET 'CAUSE WE'RE FIGHTERS.

394
00:19:21,916 --> 00:19:24,250
AND WE LOVED EACH OTHER
AS FIGHTERS.

395
00:19:24,333 --> 00:19:27,708
I THINK IT'S THE SAME
FOR YOU AND RYOMOU.

396
00:19:30,333 --> 00:19:33,416
WHAT DO YOU THINK, RYOFU?

397
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:36,416
- YOU'RE RIGHT.

398
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:40,125
I WAS BORN
DESTINED TO BE A FIGHTER,

399
00:19:40,208 --> 00:19:43,458
BUT THEN,
I FELL IN LOVE WITH YOU.

400
00:19:43,541 --> 00:19:46,791
AND SOON AFTER REALIZED
I DIDN'T HAVE LONG TO LIVE.

401
00:19:46,875 --> 00:19:48,958
SO I MADE A DECISION.

402
00:19:49,041 --> 00:19:52,583
I CHOSE TO TRUST RYOMOU
TO LOVE YOU.

403
00:19:52,666 --> 00:19:56,250
- WELCOME BACK, RYOFU.

404
00:19:57,875 --> 00:20:00,625
- NO.  NO!

405
00:20:00,708 --> 00:20:02,166
IT'S NOT FAIR.

406
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:05,333
WHY DOES EVERYBODY
ALWAYS ABANDON ME?

407
00:20:05,416 --> 00:20:07,833
MY POWERS ARE NEARLY ABSOLUTE,

408
00:20:07,916 --> 00:20:10,291
AND STILL IT ALWAYS 
TURNS OUT LIKE THIS.

409
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:11,833
- YOUR POWERS...

410
00:20:11,916 --> 00:20:14,125
SEEM TO BE MISSING
A VITAL PART.

411
00:20:14,208 --> 00:20:17,250
THEY'RE MISSING
THE POWER OF LOVE.

412
00:20:17,333 --> 00:20:20,583
WITH SAJI-- WHATEVER HAPPENED
BETWEEN THE TWO OF YOU

413
00:20:20,666 --> 00:20:22,583
DOESN'T MATTER.
NO.

414
00:20:22,666 --> 00:20:25,875
WHAT DOES MATTER IS
HOW CLEAR IT IS IN HIS ACTIONS

415
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:27,750
THAT HE CARES DEEPLY FOR YOU.

416
00:20:27,833 --> 00:20:28,750
- ( slightly gasps )

417
00:20:28,833 --> 00:20:30,916
- EVERYTHING HE DID,

418
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,250
HE WASN'T TRYING TO
DESTROY YOU.

419
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:36,125
HE WAS TRYING TO
SAVE YOU.

420
00:20:36,208 --> 00:20:38,791
- DO YOU REALLY THINK THAT
HE CARED ABOUT ME?

421
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:51,666
- WHAT IS THIS?

422
00:20:53,416 --> 00:20:55,000
IT CAN'T BE.

423
00:20:55,083 --> 00:20:56,083
( gasps )

424
00:20:58,333 --> 00:21:01,166
- ( shrieks )

425
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:02,625
- WHAT'S WRONG?

426
00:21:02,708 --> 00:21:04,916
- I'M SCARED!
THE DRAGON!

427
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,916
THE DRAGON!

428
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:07,875
( screams )
- WHAT?

429
00:21:12,875 --> 00:21:15,166
- ( screaming )

430
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:19,666
- Hakufu:
MOU-CHAN!

431
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:25,708
WHAT'S HAPPENING TO HER?

432
00:21:25,791 --> 00:21:27,708
- ( whimpering )

433
00:21:27,791 --> 00:21:30,333
PLEASE, YOU HAVE TO HELP ME.

434
00:21:30,416 --> 00:21:32,833
- IS THAT GENPOU SAJI?

435
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:34,125
- SONSAKU!

436
00:21:34,208 --> 00:21:36,291
STAY AWAY!
THAT'S THING'S DANGEROUS!

437
00:21:36,375 --> 00:21:37,333
( gasps )

438
00:21:41,125 --> 00:21:43,666
- ( chuckling )
- Hakufu: MOU-CHAN!

439
00:21:47,291 --> 00:21:48,875
- ( theme music playing )

440
00:22:08,375 --> 00:22:10,875
- ( singing in Japanese )

441
00:23:20,625 --> 00:23:22,458
- Koukin: WE ARE
FIGHTERS WHO MANIFEST

442
00:23:22,541 --> 00:23:24,833
THE SOULS OF ANCIENT HEROES.

443
00:23:24,916 --> 00:23:27,083
IS OUR PURPOSE MERELY
TO ENDLESSLY FIGHT,

444
00:23:27,166 --> 00:23:30,166
AT THE MERCY
OF DESTINY'S WHIM?

445
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:33,541
IS THERE ANYBODY OUT THERE
WHO CAN PLEASE TELL US

446
00:23:33,625 --> 00:23:36,416
WHAT IS THE PATH
THAT WE SHOULD FOLLOW?

447
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:39,666
WHAT WILL OUR FUTURE
HOLD FOR US?

448
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:42,291
FOR WHAT REASON
DO WE FIGHT?
