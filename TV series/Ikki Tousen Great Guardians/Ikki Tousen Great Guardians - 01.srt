1
00:00:44,791 --> 00:00:46,708
- YOU HAVE SOME SKILL.

2
00:00:46,791 --> 00:00:49,166
IT'S A GREAT HONOR
FACING A FIGHTER LIKE YOU.

3
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:53,875
HOWEVER, DON'T THINK
FOR A SECOND I INTEND TO LOSE.

4
00:01:05,416 --> 00:01:06,916
AAH!

5
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:49,750
- ( both gasping )

6
00:02:23,208 --> 00:02:25,458
- Koukin:
AT THAT POINT IN TIME,

7
00:02:25,541 --> 00:02:27,875
WE STILL LIVED
IN DAYS OF PEACE,

8
00:02:27,958 --> 00:02:30,500
AND HADN'T
YET REALIZED ANYTHING.

9
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:50,500
US FIGHTERS
HAD INHERITED SPIRITS--

10
00:02:50,583 --> 00:02:52,416
SPIRITS OF ANCIENT HEROES,

11
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,250
HAILING FROM THE THREE KINGDOMS,

12
00:02:54,333 --> 00:02:56,958
CHINA'S AGE OF RIVAL WARLORDS.

13
00:02:59,291 --> 00:03:01,916
- Goei: KOUKIN, DEAR.
- YEAH?

14
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,833
- YOUR BREAKFAST IS READY.

15
00:03:03,916 --> 00:03:06,541
WOULD YOU BE A DARLING
AND GRAB MY IDIOT DAUGHTER?

16
00:03:06,625 --> 00:03:08,833
I THINK SHE'S SOAKED IN THE TUB
LONG ENOUGH.

17
00:03:08,916 --> 00:03:11,708
- LITTLE DID WE KNOW
THAT THE SPIRITS

18
00:03:11,791 --> 00:03:14,166
IN OUR SACRED BEADS--
THESE HEROES--

19
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:15,791
WERE PREORDAINED TO ONCE AGAIN

20
00:03:15,875 --> 00:03:18,625
DRAW US
INTO A BATTLE OF DESTINY.

21
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:32,583
- HEY!  YOU BASTARD!
- HUH?

22
00:03:32,666 --> 00:03:34,208
HAKUFU!

23
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:40,833
HAKUFU,
WHAT'S WRONG NOW?

24
00:03:40,916 --> 00:03:42,875
- ( panting )

25
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:48,708
- OH. ( giggles )
OH, KOUKIN.

26
00:03:48,791 --> 00:03:51,708
GOOD MORNING.

27
00:04:08,166 --> 00:04:09,416
- HURRY UP, HAKUFU.

28
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:10,875
WHAT'S THE POINT
OF GETTING UP EARLY

29
00:04:10,958 --> 00:04:12,416
IF YOU'RE JUST GOING
TO TAKE FOREVER IN THE BATHROOM?

30
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:13,916
NOW THANKS TO YOUR EPISODE
IN THE TUB,

31
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,750
WE'RE RUNNING EVEN LATER
THAN USUAL.

32
00:04:15,833 --> 00:04:17,416
- HEY, IT'S NOT MY FAULT
THAT GUY HAD THE NERVE

33
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,500
TO FEEL ME UP 100 TIMES
WHILE I WAS IN THERE.

34
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:21,875
- 100?  WHAT GUY?

35
00:04:21,958 --> 00:04:23,541
- THE CENTIPEDE, OF COURSE.

36
00:04:23,625 --> 00:04:25,875
EVEN I KNOW THOSE CREEPY
LITTLE GUYS HAVE 100 LEGS.

37
00:04:25,958 --> 00:04:27,375
- 100 LEGS?

38
00:04:27,458 --> 00:04:30,208
YOU KNOW THAT'S JUST A MYTH,
RIGHT?

39
00:04:33,291 --> 00:04:35,041
- GOOD MORNING, MISS SONSAKU.

40
00:04:35,125 --> 00:04:37,125
- I HOPE YOUR MORNING IS WELL,
LEADER.

41
00:04:37,208 --> 00:04:39,166
- All:
GOOD MORNING, GOOD MORNING!

42
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:43,833
- Koukin: HAKUFU,
MY CHILDHOOD FRIEND,

43
00:04:43,916 --> 00:04:46,458
IS NOW NANYO ACADEMY'S LEADER.

44
00:05:11,791 --> 00:05:14,375
- 9,998.

45
00:05:14,458 --> 00:05:16,875
9,999...

46
00:05:16,958 --> 00:05:20,125
- I'M IMPRESSED
YOU'VE KEPT THAT UP, GAKU-CHAN.

47
00:05:20,208 --> 00:05:23,750
- WELL, YOU KNOW,
I'M ONE OF NANYO'S BIG FOUR.

48
00:05:23,833 --> 00:05:26,583
I CANNOT AFFORD
TO NEGLECT MY DAILY TRAINING.

49
00:05:26,666 --> 00:05:28,583
WOULD YOU CARE TO JOIN ME,
SONSAKU?

50
00:05:28,666 --> 00:05:30,583
- OH, NOT REALLY,
THANKS!

51
00:05:30,666 --> 00:05:32,708
IT'S NOT LIKE
I'M ONE OF THE BIG FOUR.

52
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:34,875
COME TO THINK OF IT,
WHERE ARE THE OTHERS?

53
00:05:34,958 --> 00:05:35,958
WELL, SHUYU'S
RIGHT OVER THERE.

54
00:05:36,041 --> 00:05:37,125
HMM?

55
00:05:37,208 --> 00:05:40,333
- I WASN'T TALKING
ABOUT KOUKIN.

56
00:05:49,875 --> 00:05:52,000
MOU-CHAN!
- ( gasps )

57
00:05:56,208 --> 00:05:58,541
YOU CAN'T JUST SNEAK UP
BEHIND ME LIKE THAT.

58
00:05:58,625 --> 00:06:01,125
- YOU SCARED ME.

59
00:06:01,208 --> 00:06:03,916
UH, IS SOMETHING WRONG?
YOUR FACE IS ALL RED.

60
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,500
AH, I KNOW-- YOU WERE
JUST THINKING ABOUT SAJI.

61
00:06:07,583 --> 00:06:08,833
- WHO, ME?

62
00:06:08,916 --> 00:06:11,208
LIKE I'D CARE
ABOUT THAT BIG STUPID IDIOT.

63
00:06:11,291 --> 00:06:12,708
- COME TO THINK OF IT,

64
00:06:12,791 --> 00:06:15,125
I DON'T THINK I'VE SEEN SAJI
AROUND AT ALL LATELY.

65
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:16,541
- TELL ME ABOUT IT.

66
00:06:16,625 --> 00:06:18,166
IT'S LIKE THAT IDIOT
DOESN'T EVEN CARE

67
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:19,958
ABOUT BEING
ONE OF THE BIG FOUR.

68
00:06:20,041 --> 00:06:21,625
- DO YOU THINK SOMETHING
COULD HAVE HAPPENED TO HIM?

69
00:06:21,708 --> 00:06:23,750
- PROBABLY JUST FOOLING AROUND
WITH SOME OTHER GIRL.

70
00:06:23,833 --> 00:06:25,791
- OTHER GIRL?

71
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:30,833
- BY THE WAY, SHUYU,
ANY ACTIVITY FROM KYOSHO?

72
00:06:30,916 --> 00:06:31,916
- NO.

73
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,541
APART FROM FROM THE FACT
THEIR LEADER,

74
00:06:33,625 --> 00:06:35,416
SOUSOU MOUTOKU,
IS STILL MISSING,

75
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,166
THERE'S NOTHING STRANGE
TO REPORT.

76
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:39,291
- MOU-CHAN.

77
00:06:39,375 --> 00:06:41,083
- IS THERE ANY NEWS ON SEITO?

78
00:06:41,166 --> 00:06:43,500
THERE ISN'T REALLY
A LOT GOING ON THERE EITHER.

79
00:06:43,583 --> 00:06:45,541
ALL I'VE HEARD
ARE A FEW RUMORS

80
00:06:45,625 --> 00:06:47,500
SAYING THAT KAN'U UNCHO
WILL BE RETURNING SOON.

81
00:06:47,583 --> 00:06:49,291
- HMM?
- I SEE.

82
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:52,416
SO KAN'U WENT OFF TO TRAIN
FOR A WHILE.  MAKES SENSE.

83
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,208
- YEAH.
- MOU-CHAN, MOU-CHAN, MOU-CHAN.

84
00:06:54,291 --> 00:06:55,875
- SHE LEFT SEITO
WITH HER FRIENDS.

85
00:06:55,958 --> 00:06:57,458
- I CAN'T SAY
THAT I'M NOT JEALOUS.

86
00:06:57,541 --> 00:06:59,291
IT REALLY SHOWS
THAT RYUUBI GENTOKU

87
00:06:59,375 --> 00:07:01,375
HAS GROWN QUITE NICELY
INTO BEING THEIR LEADER.

88
00:07:01,458 --> 00:07:03,250
AND BY COMPARISON,

89
00:07:03,333 --> 00:07:05,125
NANYO'S LEADER
IS NOTHING BUT A--

90
00:07:05,208 --> 00:07:06,833
( grunts )

91
00:07:06,916 --> 00:07:08,791
MOU-CHAN!

92
00:07:08,875 --> 00:07:11,291
YOU'VE GOTTEN EVEN BIGGER,
HAVEN'T YOU?

93
00:07:11,375 --> 00:07:14,708
JUST LOOK AT HOW THEY BOUNCE!
 ( laughs )

94
00:07:14,791 --> 00:07:17,750
- NO, NOT THERE!

95
00:07:19,375 --> 00:07:21,666
KNOCK IT OFF,
YOU STUPID PERVERT.

96
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:24,750
- AGH!  I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU CALLED ME STUPID!

97
00:07:24,833 --> 00:07:26,958
- SO WHAT IF I DID?
YOU ARE STUPID.

98
00:07:27,041 --> 00:07:29,125
- AGH!
YOU SAID IT AGAIN.

99
00:07:29,208 --> 00:07:31,208
WHOEVER SAYS "STUPID" FIRST
IS REALLY STUPID.

100
00:07:31,291 --> 00:07:35,333
- SONSAKU, CAN YOU PLEASE
HAVE ENOUGH DIGNITY

101
00:07:35,416 --> 00:07:38,458
TO BEHAVE MORE LIKE A LEADER?
- HUH?

102
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,625
- LEADERS HAVE A DUTY.

103
00:07:41,708 --> 00:07:43,291
THEY MUST SET THEMSELVES APART,

104
00:07:43,375 --> 00:07:45,791
BE AN IDEAL THEIR FIGHTERS
CAN ASPIRE TO.

105
00:07:45,875 --> 00:07:48,041
- PERSPIRE TO?

106
00:07:48,125 --> 00:07:50,958
- Both: ASPIRE!

107
00:07:51,041 --> 00:07:52,750
- JUST BE AN EXAMPLE
FOR ONCE.

108
00:07:52,833 --> 00:07:54,458
- IF THAT'S THE CASE, MOU-CHAN,

109
00:07:54,541 --> 00:07:56,083
YOU HAVE A LOT MORE WORK
THAN ME.

110
00:07:56,166 --> 00:07:58,666
- WHAT'S THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN?
- THINK ABOUT IT.

111
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:00,666
I ALWAYS WORK SO HARD
TRYING TO FIND YOU

112
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:04,583
ALL THOSE PART-TIME JOBS.
- AH!

113
00:08:04,666 --> 00:08:06,958
OH, NO.

114
00:08:08,916 --> 00:08:10,333
ARGH!

115
00:08:10,416 --> 00:08:13,125
WHY, YOU!
- AH!  SORRY 'BOUT THAT.

116
00:08:13,208 --> 00:08:16,291
- AND EVERY TIME,
YOU GOT FIRED, DIDN'T YOU?

117
00:08:16,375 --> 00:08:17,875
- Y-YEAH, SO WHAT?

118
00:08:17,958 --> 00:08:20,291
I DON'T EVEN GET WHY I HAVE
TO WORK IN THE FIRST PLACE.

119
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:22,458
- COME ON,
WE HAVE TO SAVE SOME MONEY

120
00:08:22,541 --> 00:08:24,500
TO GO ON
THE OVERSEAS BATTLE TOUR.

121
00:08:24,583 --> 00:08:26,875
- YOU MEAN YOU'RE REALLY SERIOUS
ABOUT DOING THAT?

122
00:08:26,958 --> 00:08:28,375
- OF COURSE I AM!

123
00:08:29,875 --> 00:08:31,666
I EVEN WROTE IT
AS "MEANS BUSINESS"

124
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:33,166
AND PRONOUNCE IT
LIKE THE WORD "EARNEST."

125
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:36,666
SO, DON'T YOU GET FIRED
FROM THE NEXT JOB YOU GET.

126
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:39,833
- LOOK, I'M NOT CUT OUT
FOR THE SERVICE INDUSTRY, OKAY?

127
00:08:39,916 --> 00:08:42,166
- IT'S AN IMPERIAL ORDER,
GOT IT?

128
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:44,333
- THERE- THERE AREN'T
ANY ORDERS LIKE THAT.

129
00:08:44,416 --> 00:08:45,958
AND IT DOESN'T MATTER ANYWAY.

130
00:08:46,041 --> 00:08:48,083
ONLY A LEADER IS ALLOWED
TO GIVE IMPERIAL ORDER.

131
00:08:48,166 --> 00:08:49,791
- WELL, WHAT DO YOU THINK?

132
00:08:49,875 --> 00:08:51,833
DOES THAT MEAN I'M BEHAVING
MORE LIKE A LEADER?

133
00:08:51,916 --> 00:08:53,416
- HUH?

134
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:56,208
TOLD YA!  THAT WAS EASIER
THAN I THOUGHT.

135
00:08:56,291 --> 00:08:58,375
- HOLD ON, NO!
- I'M THE LEADER.  GO!

136
00:08:58,458 --> 00:09:00,041
- ( both sigh )
- CUT IT OUT.

137
00:09:10,791 --> 00:09:12,541
- ( door opens )

138
00:09:22,208 --> 00:09:24,375
- KAN'U, WELCOME BACK.

139
00:09:24,458 --> 00:09:26,541
I MISSED YOU SO MUCH.

140
00:09:26,625 --> 00:09:29,541
- GE-- GENTOKU.

141
00:09:29,625 --> 00:09:32,875
- CONGRATULATIONS
ON ALL YOUR TRAINING.

142
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,875
I MISSED YOU...

143
00:09:37,958 --> 00:09:39,916
- ( panting )

144
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,333
- ...SO VERY MUCH.

145
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:45,250
- ( both giggling )

146
00:09:48,041 --> 00:09:50,375
- GENTOKU.

147
00:09:50,458 --> 00:09:52,791
- KAN'U.

148
00:09:56,583 --> 00:09:58,500
KAN'U?

149
00:10:01,208 --> 00:10:04,583
IS SOMETHING THE MATTER?
- NO. I WAS JUST THINKING THAT I

150
00:10:04,666 --> 00:10:07,708
NEEDED TO PAY A VISIT TO
YOKOHAMA SO I CAN PRAY.

151
00:10:07,791 --> 00:10:09,916
I STILL NEED TO REPORT
MY TRAINING AT KANTEIBYO.

152
00:10:11,166 --> 00:10:15,750
GENTOKU,
WOULD YOU COME WITH ME?

153
00:10:15,833 --> 00:10:16,750
- YES.

154
00:10:16,833 --> 00:10:18,833
I'D BE HAPPY TO JOIN YOU.

155
00:10:18,916 --> 00:10:20,708
AH, AND AS LONG
AS WE'RE DOWN THERE,

156
00:10:20,791 --> 00:10:22,458
WE CAN GO TO CHINATOWN
FOR LUNCH.

157
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:27,291
DOWN THERE, WE CAN GO
TO CHINATOWN FOR LUNCH.

158
00:10:27,375 --> 00:10:29,916
- ( gasping )

159
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,916
- CHINESE FOOD?

160
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,041
I WANT TO HAVE SOME TOO.

161
00:10:36,125 --> 00:10:38,916
- KOUMEI,
IF YOU WANT CHINESE FOOD,

162
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,958
TOMORROW I'LL BUY SWEET 'N'
CHILI SHRIMP, OR WHATEVER.

163
00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:42,958
- IF ALL OF US
ARE GOING TO CHINATOWN,

164
00:10:43,041 --> 00:10:46,875
I WON'T REST UNTIL I'VE HAD
MY FILL OF CHINESE BUNS!

165
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:48,750
- CHINESE BUNS?

166
00:10:48,833 --> 00:10:51,291
- OH, YOU MEAN YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT THEY ARE, GENTOKU?

167
00:10:51,375 --> 00:10:52,416
- YEAH.

168
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,166
- WELL THAT SETTLES IT, KAN'U.

169
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:58,125
GENTOKU HAS TO FIND
SOME CHINESE BUNS AND EAT THEM.

170
00:10:58,208 --> 00:10:59,625
- Koumei: ME TOO.

171
00:10:59,708 --> 00:11:01,916
I'VE NEVER HAD
THOSE BUNS BEFORE EITHER.

172
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,791
- Ryuubi: YOU TOO, KOUMEI?
IN THAT CASE,

173
00:11:03,875 --> 00:11:06,041
WE ALL HAVE TO GO
EAT SOME CHINESE BUNS.

174
00:11:06,125 --> 00:11:07,750
IT'S OKAY, RIGHT, KAN'U?

175
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:10,791
- IF-- IF YOU SAY SO,
GENTOKU.

176
00:11:10,875 --> 00:11:13,458
- YAY.
WE ALL GET TO GO OUT TOGETHER.

177
00:11:13,541 --> 00:11:16,458
I CAN'T WAIT!
- Koumei: I CAN'T WAIT EITHER.

178
00:11:16,541 --> 00:11:18,375
- Ekitoku: SAME HERE!

179
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:50,916
- I AM GRATEFUL
TO HAVE RETURNED SAFELY.

180
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,333
PLEASE CONTINUE TO WATCH OVER
THE WELFARE OF SEITO ACADEMY.

181
00:11:54,416 --> 00:11:56,500
- Ekitoku: EVERYTHING HERE
LOOKS SO FREAKIN' TASTY.

182
00:11:56,583 --> 00:11:58,333
- OOH,
THIS LOOKS REALLY GOOD TOO.

183
00:11:58,416 --> 00:11:59,916
- HEY, YOU THREE,

184
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,333
WE'RE AT A SACRED TEMPLE
RIGHT NOW.

185
00:12:02,416 --> 00:12:04,791
- OH, KAN'U, ARE YOU DONE
WITH YOUR VISIT YET?

186
00:12:04,875 --> 00:12:08,250
COME ON, HURRY UP
SO WE CAN GET SOME BUNS ALREADY!

187
00:12:08,333 --> 00:12:10,208
- Ryuubi: LET'S GO.

188
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:13,750
- Sonsaku: WELCOME!

189
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:16,041
- MISS SONSAKU?

190
00:12:18,791 --> 00:12:20,791
- RYU-CHAN?

191
00:12:20,875 --> 00:12:22,375
AH!

192
00:12:22,458 --> 00:12:26,333
- HAKUFU, JUST WHAT DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE DOING?  HUH?

193
00:12:26,416 --> 00:12:28,041
THE SEITO GIRLS.

194
00:12:28,125 --> 00:12:31,291
- HEY, WHAT'RE THE TWO OF YOU
DOING IN CHINATOWN?

195
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:33,625
- Ryuubi: SO YOU'RE BOTH
WORKING HERE PART-TIME

196
00:12:33,708 --> 00:12:35,333
TO HELP RAISE FUNDS
FOR YOUR CLUB?

197
00:12:35,416 --> 00:12:39,208
- YEP. WE'RE DEFINITELY GOING
ON THE OVERSEAS BATTLE TOUR.

198
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:41,125
FACING OFF AGAINST FOREIGN
POWERHOUSES ACROSS

199
00:12:41,208 --> 00:12:43,458
THE SEA IN BATTLE-- SO STOKED!

200
00:12:43,541 --> 00:12:45,416
- THAT DOES SOUND
LIKE A LOT OF FUN.

201
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,541
KAN'U, DO YOU THINK
WE CAN TRY THAT TOO?

202
00:12:47,625 --> 00:12:50,000
- I WON'T DENY
THAT IT DOES SOUND INTERESTING.

203
00:12:50,083 --> 00:12:52,000
- Ryuubi: MISS SONSAKU.
- HUH?

204
00:12:52,083 --> 00:12:53,208
- HERE.

205
00:12:53,291 --> 00:12:55,000
IF YOU TAKE THE TIME
TO SIT DOWN

206
00:12:55,083 --> 00:12:57,541
AND DEVOTE YOURSELF TO ENRICHING
YOUR MIND THROUGH READING,

207
00:12:57,625 --> 00:12:59,416
YOU WON'T HAVE TO TRAVEL
ALL THE WAY OVERSEAS

208
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:01,416
TO ENJOY THE THRILL
OF A GOOD BATTLE.

209
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:03,166
- READING, HUH?

210
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:05,375
- MMM.
WHETHER YOU LIKE IT OR NOT,

211
00:13:05,458 --> 00:13:06,958
READING IS IMPORTANT.

212
00:13:07,041 --> 00:13:08,666
- THANK YOU ALL FOR WAITING.

213
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:11,916
HAKUFU, THIS IS NO TIME
TO BE DAWDLING AROUND.

214
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,916
GET BACK TO WORK, OKAY?

215
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:14,958
- ROGER THAT, SIR.

216
00:13:15,041 --> 00:13:18,458
WELL, TAKE YOUR TIME,
YOU GUYS.

217
00:13:18,541 --> 00:13:21,625
- All: THANKS FOR THE FOOD!

218
00:13:21,708 --> 00:13:24,000
- Ryuubi:
ARE THESE THE CHINESE BUNS?

219
00:13:24,083 --> 00:13:26,500
- Ekitoku: YEP!
FEEL FREE TO DIG RIGHT IN.

220
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:31,750
- MMM!

221
00:13:31,833 --> 00:13:34,333
- WHAT DO YOU THINK, GENTOKU?
PRETTY GOOD, HUH?

222
00:13:34,416 --> 00:13:37,458
- YES!
THEY'RE AMAZING.

223
00:13:37,541 --> 00:13:39,625
- YOU SEE?
BE SURE TO THANK KAN'U

224
00:13:39,708 --> 00:13:41,291
FOR LETTING US
VISIT THE SHRINE WITH HER.

225
00:13:41,375 --> 00:13:44,666
- RIGHT.  THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR BRINGING US, KAN'U.

226
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:46,458
- EKITOKU,

227
00:13:46,541 --> 00:13:48,583
YOU'RE MY FAVORITE PERSON
IN THE WORLD RIGHT NOW.

228
00:13:48,666 --> 00:13:49,625
- HUH?

229
00:13:49,708 --> 00:13:52,291
- GENTOKU,
I WANT TO HAVE SOME TOO.

230
00:13:52,375 --> 00:13:55,416
- OH, KOUMEI,
YOU'RE SO SPOILED.

231
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:58,375
HERE.
OPEN UP AND SAY "AH."

232
00:13:58,458 --> 00:13:59,791
- AHH.

233
00:13:59,875 --> 00:14:03,791
- HOW DOES IT TASTE, KOUMEI?
- IT'S SO GOOD.

234
00:14:03,875 --> 00:14:08,291
- KAN'U,
NOW OPEN WIDE FOR ME, OKAY?

235
00:14:08,375 --> 00:14:09,583
- AH.

236
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,125
- Ekitoku: KAN'U?

237
00:14:18,208 --> 00:14:19,833
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?

238
00:14:22,083 --> 00:14:25,333
- IT-- IT'S NOTHING AT ALL.
( clears throat )

239
00:14:25,416 --> 00:14:26,708
GEN-- GENTOKU.

240
00:14:26,791 --> 00:14:28,875
- IS SOMETHING THE MATTER,
KAN'U?

241
00:14:28,958 --> 00:14:30,541
- IT'S MY CHOPSTICKS.

242
00:14:30,625 --> 00:14:32,458
I DON'T THINK THEY'LL REACH
THE BUNS FROM HERE.

243
00:14:32,541 --> 00:14:34,916
SO WOULD YOU--

244
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,583
WOULD YOU MIND
FEEDING ONE TO ME?

245
00:14:36,666 --> 00:14:38,375
- SURE!

246
00:14:38,458 --> 00:14:40,541
- OH, WAIT,
I CAN GET ONE FOR YOU.

247
00:14:40,625 --> 00:14:42,291
- NO.

248
00:14:42,375 --> 00:14:45,083
- HERE YOU GO, KAN'U.

249
00:14:45,166 --> 00:14:48,291
- EKITOKU, YOU'RE THE WORST
PERSON IN THE WORLD RIGHT NOW.

250
00:14:48,375 --> 00:14:49,708
- HUH?

251
00:14:49,791 --> 00:14:53,875
- ( crashing )
- AH!

252
00:14:53,958 --> 00:14:55,958
HA! 
WAIT UP, WAIT UP, WAIT UP!

253
00:14:56,041 --> 00:14:58,458
- THAT'S IT.

254
00:14:58,541 --> 00:15:00,708
THAT JUST MIGHT DO IT.

255
00:15:00,791 --> 00:15:02,708
- HUH?

256
00:15:05,791 --> 00:15:09,083
OH, KAN'U, WHAT AM I GOING
TO DO WITH YOU?

257
00:15:18,625 --> 00:15:21,875
- Sonsaku:
THANK YOU FOR THE FOOD!

258
00:15:23,583 --> 00:15:25,500
- MMM!

259
00:15:25,583 --> 00:15:27,875
OH, THAT'S SO GOOD.

260
00:15:27,958 --> 00:15:31,750
- HAKUFU SONSAKU,
WHY ARE YOU EVEN HERE?

261
00:15:31,833 --> 00:15:34,333
- I JUST FINISHED MY SHIFT
FOR THE DAY, SO I THOUGHT

262
00:15:34,416 --> 00:15:36,916
IT'D BE FUN TO HAVE A SEAT
AND JOIN YOU GUYS.

263
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,500
- SORRY ABOUT THIS.
I TRIED TO STOP HER.

264
00:15:39,583 --> 00:15:41,541
- WE'RE HAPPY TO HAVE YOU,
MISS SONSAKU.

265
00:15:41,625 --> 00:15:43,708
AFTER ALL,
WHEN IT COMES TO MEALS,

266
00:15:43,791 --> 00:15:45,250
THE MORE THE MERRIER, RIGHT?

267
00:15:45,333 --> 00:15:47,333
- YOU'RE TOTALLY RIGHT,
RYU-CHAN.

268
00:15:47,416 --> 00:15:49,000
IT'S LIKE OUR BRAINS
ARE THE SAME.

269
00:15:49,083 --> 00:15:50,833
HIT ME AGAIN.
AHH!

270
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:54,041
- ALL RIGHT, IF YOU INSIST.
- ARGH!

271
00:16:00,458 --> 00:16:02,750
- WH-- WHAT?

272
00:16:07,041 --> 00:16:09,791
- Ryuubi: IT'S SO COLD.

273
00:16:09,875 --> 00:16:14,666
KAN'U, WHY DID YOU POUND
THE TABLE LIKE THA--

274
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:16,750
AH-CHOO!

275
00:16:16,833 --> 00:16:19,250
- I'M SORRY, GENTOKU.

276
00:16:19,333 --> 00:16:21,125
- RYU-CHAN!

277
00:16:23,666 --> 00:16:27,083
- WHAT DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE DOING, MISS SONSAKU?

278
00:16:27,166 --> 00:16:29,000
- YOU HAVE TO HURRY UP
AND CHANGE YOUR CLOTHES

279
00:16:29,083 --> 00:16:30,500
OR YOU'LL CATCH A COLD.

280
00:16:30,583 --> 00:16:33,500
- ( laughs )
YOU'RE TICKLING ME.

281
00:16:33,583 --> 00:16:36,166
- GET YOUR HANDS OFF HER.
- HUH?

282
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:37,541
- YOU HEARD ME.

283
00:16:37,625 --> 00:16:39,250
STOP BUTTING IN,
YOU PATHETIC NANYO.

284
00:16:39,333 --> 00:16:41,458
- PATHETIC NANYO?

285
00:16:41,541 --> 00:16:43,458
NANYO AND SEITO HAVE
NOTHING TO DO WITH

286
00:16:43,541 --> 00:16:44,541
WHAT'S GOING ON RIGHT NOW.

287
00:16:44,625 --> 00:16:45,916
- THAT'S WHERE YOU'RE WRONG.

288
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,291
SEITO HAS ITS OWN WAY
OF DOING THINGS AROUND HERE.

289
00:16:48,375 --> 00:16:49,708
- WHAT'S THE MATTER?
WHY ARE YOU SO ANGRY

290
00:16:49,791 --> 00:16:56,916
ALL OF A SUDDEN?
- NO MORE TALK!

291
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,791
- OH!

292
00:16:58,875 --> 00:17:01,208
- HUH?

293
00:17:01,291 --> 00:17:04,791
- ALL RIGHT,
NOW YOU'VE DONE IT!

294
00:17:04,875 --> 00:17:07,125
IF I GO HOME WITH MY UNIFORM
ALL TORN UP LIKE THIS,

295
00:17:07,208 --> 00:17:09,250
MY MOM'S GONNA KILL ME.

296
00:17:09,333 --> 00:17:11,958
DAMN YOU!

297
00:17:16,541 --> 00:17:19,375
- WATCH OUT!
- HUH?

298
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:26,208
HUH?

299
00:17:27,541 --> 00:17:30,333
- I'M SORRY,
YOU AREN'T HURT, ARE YOU?

300
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:31,458
- SHIRYU!

301
00:17:31,541 --> 00:17:33,958
- SHIRYU CHOU'UN.

302
00:17:34,041 --> 00:17:35,208
- ( rumbling )
HUH?

303
00:17:36,541 --> 00:17:39,500
- ( all screaming )

304
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:47,166
- WELL, KAN'U, I BELIEVE
YOU CAN TAKE IT FROM HERE.

305
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:49,000
NOW THAT I'M PRESENT,

306
00:17:49,083 --> 00:17:52,208
WE CAN MAKE SURE OUR LEADER
IS PROTECTED.

307
00:17:52,291 --> 00:17:53,875
- Koukin:
OUR FIGHTERS' SPIRITS,

308
00:17:53,958 --> 00:17:56,250
WHO HAD FALLEN
INTO THE GRAND DREAM,

309
00:17:56,333 --> 00:17:58,625
HAVE YET TO FIND PEACE

310
00:17:58,708 --> 00:18:01,541
AND STILL WISH TO HAVE US SEEK
OUT BATTLES ON THEIR BEHALF.

311
00:18:01,625 --> 00:18:04,500
- ( both grunting )

312
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:07,500
- SUN TZU TEACHES...
- All: HUH?

313
00:18:09,375 --> 00:18:12,583
- ..."THE ART OF WAR IS OF
VITAL IMPORTANCE TO THE STATE,

314
00:18:12,666 --> 00:18:16,208
A MATTER OF LIFE AND DEATH,
AND IT MUST BE STUDIED."

315
00:18:16,291 --> 00:18:18,125
- HUH?
- SUN TZU.

316
00:18:18,208 --> 00:18:19,583
HE WROTE THAT
IN HIS FOREWORD.

317
00:18:22,291 --> 00:18:23,916
- A FIGHTER?

318
00:18:28,958 --> 00:18:31,208
- Sonken: YOUNG LADIES
SHOULD NOT BE SO BRAZEN

319
00:18:31,291 --> 00:18:33,375
TO BE EXPOSING THEIR SKIN
OR THEIR UNDERWEAR

320
00:18:33,458 --> 00:18:36,083
IN THE PRESENCE OF OTHERS.
- HUH?

321
00:18:36,166 --> 00:18:39,833
- I HATE TO TROUBLE YOU, BUT MAY
I PLEASE ASK YOU A QUESTION?

322
00:18:39,916 --> 00:18:42,416
- OH.  OF COURSE
YOU MOST CERTAINLY MAY.

323
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,541
- I HAVE COME HERE
WITH THE UNDERSTANDING

324
00:18:44,625 --> 00:18:46,875
THAT MY SISTER
MAY BE HERE AS WELL.

325
00:18:46,958 --> 00:18:48,041
- YOUR SISTER?

326
00:18:48,125 --> 00:18:50,500
- SHE IS KNOWN
AS THE "LITTLE CONQUEROR",

327
00:18:50,583 --> 00:18:53,208
AND IS THE CURRENT LEADER
OF NANYO ACADEMY.

328
00:18:53,291 --> 00:18:54,916
I'M TERRIBLY SORRY.

329
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,916
I SHOULD HAVE MENTIONED EARLIER
THAT MY NAME IS CHUUBO SONKEN.

330
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,458
- Both: CHUUBO?
- Both: SONKEN?

331
00:19:00,541 --> 00:19:04,166
- WELL NOW, THAT'S THE NAME
OF THE BLUE-EYED CHILD OF KOTO,

332
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:06,375
SIBLING
OF THE LITTLE CONQUEROR.

333
00:19:06,458 --> 00:19:08,041
- WAIT A SECOND, HAKUFU.

334
00:19:08,125 --> 00:19:09,833
SHE'S YOUR--
- HUH?

335
00:19:09,916 --> 00:19:11,500
- HAKUFU?

336
00:19:11,583 --> 00:19:15,000
MIGHT YOU BE THE HAKUFU SONSAKU
I'VE LOOKED FOR?

337
00:19:15,083 --> 00:19:19,166
- THAT I JUST MIGHT BE.
WHAT?

338
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:21,666
- IT IS MY PLEASURE TO MEET YOU.

339
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:24,041
ACTUALLY,
I'M YOUR YOUNGER SISTER.

340
00:19:24,125 --> 00:19:27,500
MY NAME IS CHUUBO SONKEN.

341
00:19:29,458 --> 00:19:31,208
- OH, RIGHT.

342
00:19:31,291 --> 00:19:33,208
I WASN'T SURE
WHO YOU MEANT BY SISTER,

343
00:19:33,291 --> 00:19:35,291
BUT YOU PROBABLY DON'T MEAN ME.

344
00:19:39,958 --> 00:19:41,875
NO WAY!

345
00:19:41,958 --> 00:19:45,083
I HAVE A YOUNGER SISTER?!

346
00:19:48,791 --> 00:19:51,333
- ( drawer closes )
- Kada: THERE, ALL DONE.

347
00:19:51,416 --> 00:19:53,000
HERE, PUT THIS ON.

348
00:19:53,083 --> 00:19:54,958
THERE'S A CHARM
WOVEN INTO THE BACK OF THE GAUZE

349
00:19:55,041 --> 00:19:57,333
THAT'LL HELP KEEP THAT DRAGON
OF YOURS UNDER CONTROL.

350
00:19:57,416 --> 00:19:59,875
- THANK YOU VERY MUCH,
DR. KADA.

351
00:19:59,958 --> 00:20:03,208
- EVER SINCE THE FIGHT
WITH SOUSOU,

352
00:20:03,291 --> 00:20:06,000
HAKUFU SONSAKU'S DRAGON
AND GENTOKU'S RYUUBI'S DRAGON

353
00:20:06,083 --> 00:20:07,833
HAVE BOTH BEEN DORMANT.

354
00:20:07,916 --> 00:20:11,250
RYOMOU, IT SEEMS YOURS,
AT LEAST, STILL REMAINS.

355
00:20:11,333 --> 00:20:14,500
- I WILL GO TO MY GRAVE WITH
THE DRAGON DWELLING WITHIN ME.

356
00:20:14,583 --> 00:20:17,291
THAT IS THE DESTINY
I AM FOREVER CURSED WITH.

357
00:20:17,375 --> 00:20:19,750
AS LONG AS I REMAIN LIVING,

358
00:20:19,833 --> 00:20:23,916
THE DRAGON
WILL ALSO CONTINUE ON LIVING.

359
00:20:26,916 --> 00:20:28,791
- ( cellphone chiming )

360
00:20:40,041 --> 00:20:42,250
- ( door opens )

361
00:20:48,166 --> 00:20:49,458
- SAJI.

362
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:57,708
WHY DID YOU GO OFF AND DISAPPEAR
WITHOUT SAYING ANYTHING TO ME?

363
00:20:57,791 --> 00:21:00,833
WHY DO YOU ALWAYS HAVE TO GO OFF
AND DO EVERYTHING ON YOUR OWN?

364
00:21:00,916 --> 00:21:03,083
WAIT, HOLD ON.

365
00:21:12,083 --> 00:21:13,916
SAJI!

366
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,916
AH!

367
00:21:20,333 --> 00:21:23,250
MY BODY WON'T LISTEN TO ME.

368
00:21:23,333 --> 00:21:27,125
IT CAN'T BE THE DRAGON.

369
00:21:47,708 --> 00:21:50,625
- ( end theme playing )

370
00:21:53,416 --> 00:21:55,791
- ( singing in Japanese )

371
00:23:19,083 --> 00:23:20,833
- Sonsaku:
HEY, SO IS IT REALLY TRUE

372
00:23:20,916 --> 00:23:22,250
THAT YOU'RE MY YOUNGER SISTER?

373
00:23:22,333 --> 00:23:24,583
- YES, I CAN HONESTLY SAY
I AM THE YOUNGER SISTER

374
00:23:24,666 --> 00:23:26,458
OF HAKUFU SONSAKU.

375
00:23:26,541 --> 00:23:28,583
- HMM, WHAT THEN?
DOES THAT MEAN DAD

376
00:23:28,666 --> 00:23:31,375
USED FOOL AROUND WITH
A BUNCH OF STRANGE WOMEN?

377
00:23:31,458 --> 00:23:32,916
HANG ON A SECOND.

378
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,958
I CAN'T SEE HIM
DOING THAT AT ALL.

379
00:23:35,041 --> 00:23:36,958
YOU DON'T MEAN MAMA
FOUND SOME CRAZY HOTTIE

380
00:23:37,041 --> 00:23:38,708
SHE KEPT FROM PAPA, DO YOU?

381
00:23:38,791 --> 00:23:41,333
TCH, THAT OVER-THE-HILL CROCK!

382
00:23:41,416 --> 00:23:44,125
- UM, WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
OVER-THE-HILL CROCK?
