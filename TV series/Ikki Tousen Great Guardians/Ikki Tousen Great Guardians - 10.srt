1
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,916
- ( theme music playing )

2
00:00:20,833 --> 00:00:22,958
- ( singing in Japanese )

3
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:40,208
- Goei: YES, I UNDERSTAND.

4
00:01:40,291 --> 00:01:42,541
THANK YOU FOR GOING OUT OF
YOUR WAY TO HELP ME WITH THIS.

5
00:01:42,625 --> 00:01:44,291
I APPRECIATE IT.

6
00:01:44,375 --> 00:01:46,333
WHAT?  HOW'S HAKUFU?

7
00:01:46,416 --> 00:01:49,000
OH, SHE'S DOING FINE.
THANKS AGAIN.

8
00:01:49,083 --> 00:01:50,666
YOU TAKE CARE TOO.

9
00:01:54,791 --> 00:01:56,041
HUH?

10
00:01:56,125 --> 00:01:57,458
YOU'RE UP EARLY
THIS MORNING.

11
00:01:57,541 --> 00:01:59,791
IS ANYTHING THE MATTER,
HAKUFU?

12
00:01:59,875 --> 00:02:01,333
- I'VE JUST HAD 
THIS BAD FEELING

13
00:02:01,416 --> 00:02:04,041
ABOUT MOU-CHAN EVER SINCE
LAST NIGHT'S STORM.

14
00:02:04,125 --> 00:02:06,291
I COULDN'T GET TO SLEEP. 
I JUST TOSSED AND TURNED.

15
00:02:06,375 --> 00:02:08,041
- NOW THAT'S MY DAUGHTER.

16
00:02:08,125 --> 00:02:09,791
WORRYING ABOUT
ONE OF HER FIGHTERS

17
00:02:09,875 --> 00:02:11,166
LIKE A PROPER LEADER SHOULD.

18
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:13,708
ON THAT FRONT, I HAVE
SOME GOOD NEWS FOR YOU.

19
00:02:13,791 --> 00:02:16,250
- GOOD NEWS?
YOU KNOW SOMETHING?

20
00:02:16,333 --> 00:02:18,916
- I JUST LEARNED THAT
RYOMOU WENT TO THE MOUNTAINS

21
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,708
TO GET A LITTLE TRAINING
AND DO SOME SELF-REFLECTION.

22
00:02:21,791 --> 00:02:24,583
WHAT'S MORE, I HEARD SHE'LL
BE COMING BACK VERY SOON.

23
00:02:24,666 --> 00:02:25,791
- HUH?

24
00:02:25,875 --> 00:02:27,708
HOW DID YOU FIND OUT
ABOUT MOU-CHAN?

25
00:02:27,791 --> 00:02:29,333
- I HAVE A FRIEND
WHO LIVES ON THE MOUNTAIN

26
00:02:29,416 --> 00:02:31,541
WHERE SHE WENT TO
BRUSH UP ON HER TECHNIQUE.

27
00:02:31,625 --> 00:02:34,291
BUT THAT'S NOT IMPORTANT NOW.
PUT YOUR MIND TO REST

28
00:02:34,375 --> 00:02:36,250
AND GET READY FOR SCHOOL
ON THE DOUBLE.

29
00:02:36,333 --> 00:02:37,500
- AYE-AYE, CAPTAIN.

30
00:02:37,583 --> 00:02:39,375
THANK YOU, MOM!

31
00:02:39,458 --> 00:02:41,750
MORNING BATH,
HERE I COME. 

32
00:02:43,333 --> 00:02:44,625
- ( chuckles )

33
00:02:44,708 --> 00:02:47,416
THAT GIRL SURE DOES
LOVE THE WATER.

34
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,125
OH, NO.  I FORGOT.

35
00:02:52,208 --> 00:02:54,125
- ( grunts )

36
00:02:54,208 --> 00:02:55,375
BYE-BYE.

37
00:02:57,166 --> 00:02:59,083
GERONIMO!

38
00:02:59,166 --> 00:03:00,708
( screams )

39
00:03:07,083 --> 00:03:08,583
OW.

40
00:03:08,666 --> 00:03:10,000
- Chuubo:
I'M SORRY, BIG SISTER.

41
00:03:10,083 --> 00:03:11,958
- IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT,
CHUUBO.

42
00:03:12,041 --> 00:03:14,291
AUNT GOEI ASKED YOU
TO DRAIN THE TUB TO CLEAN IT.

43
00:03:14,375 --> 00:03:16,875
BESIDES, THERE'S A WORD
FOR PEOPLE WHO DON'T BOTHER

44
00:03:16,958 --> 00:03:18,416
TO CHECK THE POOL
OR TUB FOR WATER 

45
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:20,416
BEFORE JUMPING INTO IT.
"STUPID."

46
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,250
- HEY, THAT WAS MEAN.

47
00:03:22,333 --> 00:03:24,916
YOU'RE ALWAYS CALLING ME
THAT LATELY.

48
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,541
AND IT'S LIKE YOU'VE BEEN
GIVING ME THE COLD SHOULDER

49
00:03:27,625 --> 00:03:28,833
EVER SINCE CHUUBO CAME.

50
00:03:28,916 --> 00:03:30,166
( gasps )

51
00:03:35,541 --> 00:03:37,125
OHH.

52
00:03:37,208 --> 00:03:38,458
( gasps )

53
00:03:38,541 --> 00:03:39,666
ARE YOU TWO--?

54
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:42,125
- ( gasps )
- NO, THERE'S NOTHING.

55
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:43,791
- ( gasps )

56
00:03:43,875 --> 00:03:47,333
- BIG SISTER, IS THAT
WHO I THINK IT IS?

57
00:03:47,416 --> 00:03:49,500
LOOK UP THERE.
- OH?

58
00:03:56,708 --> 00:03:58,958
( giggles )
FU-CHIN!

59
00:03:59,041 --> 00:04:01,166
- WHERE DID SHE COME FROM?

60
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:03,750
WASN'T SHE SUPPOSED TO BE 
OFF WITH RYOMOU SOMEWHERE?

61
00:04:03,833 --> 00:04:05,833
- BIG BROTHER KOUKIN?

62
00:04:05,916 --> 00:04:07,833
- WHAT IS IT, CHUUBO?
TELL ME.

63
00:04:07,916 --> 00:04:09,666
- IT'S RYOFU.

64
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,791
SOMETHING'S SCARING ME.

65
00:04:11,875 --> 00:04:13,166
( sighs )

66
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:16,166
- FU-CHIN!  COME ON.

67
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:17,625
WAIT UP.

68
00:04:21,166 --> 00:04:23,375
- I HOPE YOU'RE WRONG.

69
00:04:26,416 --> 00:04:28,333
- ( sighs )

70
00:04:45,958 --> 00:04:47,541
OHH?

71
00:04:52,291 --> 00:04:53,541
- LOOKING FOR SOMEONE?

72
00:04:55,583 --> 00:04:56,916
- ( laughs )
I FOUND YOU!

73
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,125
- ( gasps )

74
00:04:58,208 --> 00:05:01,208
- ( giggles )
SORRY ABOUT THAT.

75
00:05:01,291 --> 00:05:03,208
I'M JUST SO HAPPY
TO SEE YOU.

76
00:05:03,291 --> 00:05:05,208
- YOU ARE HAPPY?

77
00:05:05,291 --> 00:05:06,541
- MM-HMM.

78
00:05:06,625 --> 00:05:08,375
I WAS SO WORRIED
ABOUT MOU-CHAN

79
00:05:08,458 --> 00:05:09,875
THAT I COULDN'T
SLEEP LAST NIGHT.

80
00:05:09,958 --> 00:05:12,708
BUT NOW THAT I FOUND YOU,
I FEEL MUCH BETTER.

81
00:05:12,791 --> 00:05:14,625
- YOU FEEL BETTER
BECAUSE OF ME?

82
00:05:14,708 --> 00:05:16,208
- OF COURSE I DO.

83
00:05:16,291 --> 00:05:19,083
YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE I CAN
TALK TO ABOUT THESE THINGS.

84
00:05:19,166 --> 00:05:21,583
FU-CHIN, DO YOU KNOW
WHERE MOU-CHAN IS?

85
00:05:21,666 --> 00:05:24,125
- I DON'T KNOW WHERE
RYOMOU IS NOW.

86
00:05:24,208 --> 00:05:26,416
DON'T YOU HAVE A BETTER 
IDEA WHERE SHE MIGHT BE?

87
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,250
WHERE DOES SHE GO AND SPEND
MOST OF HER TIME?

88
00:05:28,333 --> 00:05:30,583
- UMM... WHERE DOES SHE GO?

89
00:05:30,666 --> 00:05:32,208
I KNOW, THE DOCTOR!

90
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:35,916
DR. KADA KNOWS EVERYTHING
THERE IS TO KNOW ABOUT MOU-CHAN.

91
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,916
COME ON.  LET'S GO.

92
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:44,250
AW, MAN!

93
00:05:44,333 --> 00:05:47,083
OF ALL THE TIMES FOR THE DOCTOR
TO BE OUT OF THE CLINIC.

94
00:05:47,166 --> 00:05:48,541
( sighs )

95
00:05:48,625 --> 00:05:49,791
- DON'T GET SO DOWN.

96
00:05:49,875 --> 00:05:51,750
I'M SURE SHE'LL SHOW UP
AGAIN AT SOME POINT.

97
00:05:51,833 --> 00:05:53,125
- RIGHT.

98
00:05:53,208 --> 00:05:54,791
WE JUST HAVE TO GO LOOK
FOR HER SOMEWHERE ELSE.

99
00:06:01,083 --> 00:06:02,750
HEY, MOU-CHAN.

100
00:06:02,833 --> 00:06:04,250
- ( screams, crying )

101
00:06:04,333 --> 00:06:06,333
- ( screams )
I'M SO SORRY!

102
00:06:11,375 --> 00:06:12,708
LET'S TRY HERE.

103
00:06:12,791 --> 00:06:14,291
MOU-CHAN LOVES 
FIGHTING GAMES.

104
00:06:14,375 --> 00:06:16,208
SHE TOTALLY KICKS ASS
AT COMBOS.

105
00:06:16,291 --> 00:06:17,833
COME ON, COME ON.

106
00:06:17,916 --> 00:06:19,916
WHY WON'T YOU DIE ALREADY?

107
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,458
TAKE THAT, AND THIS.

108
00:06:21,541 --> 00:06:22,833
POWER MOVE!

109
00:06:22,916 --> 00:06:24,833
GO GO GO GO,
GOTCHA!

110
00:06:24,916 --> 00:06:26,958
ALL RIGHT!

111
00:06:27,041 --> 00:06:28,500
WAIT, WHAT AM I DOING?

112
00:06:28,583 --> 00:06:29,833
SHE'S NOT IN THE GAME.

113
00:06:32,041 --> 00:06:34,083
SHE ISN'T ANYWHERE.

114
00:06:34,166 --> 00:06:36,500
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO,
FU-CHIN?

115
00:06:36,583 --> 00:06:38,291
- RYOMOU'S A BIG GIRL.

116
00:06:38,375 --> 00:06:40,583
I'M SURE SHE CAN
TAKE CARE OF HERSELF.

117
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:43,041
WHY ARE YOU SO WORRIED?
WHAT'S SHE TO YOU?

118
00:06:43,125 --> 00:06:44,333
- HUH?

119
00:06:44,416 --> 00:06:47,000
WHAT DOES MOU-CHAN
MEAN TO ME?

120
00:06:47,083 --> 00:06:48,333
HMM.

121
00:06:48,416 --> 00:06:50,666
UM, THAT'S HARD TO
PUT INTO WORDS.

122
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:53,000
THE FIRST TIME WE MET,
SHE CHOKED ME

123
00:06:53,083 --> 00:06:54,666
AND KNOCKED ME
UNCONSCIOUS.

124
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:57,166
SHE GETS ANGRY AT ALMOST
EVERYTHING I SAY.

125
00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:00,625
AND UNLIKE ME,
SHE'S REALLY SMART AND SERIOUS.

126
00:07:00,708 --> 00:07:04,333
THOUGH SHE'S NOT SO GOOD
AT KEEPING PART-TIME JOBS.

127
00:07:04,416 --> 00:07:06,625
SOMETIMES I CATCH HER
ALL BY HERSELF

128
00:07:06,708 --> 00:07:09,291
JUST STARING WITH THIS
LONELY LOOK ON HER FACE.

129
00:07:09,375 --> 00:07:11,958
I GET REALLY WORRIED
WHEN SHE DOES THAT. 

130
00:07:12,041 --> 00:07:13,750
BUT MOU-CHAN DOESN'T
TALK MUCH AT ALL,

131
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:15,875
LET ALONE WHEN SOMETHING'S
TROUBLING HER.

132
00:07:15,958 --> 00:07:18,000
I KNOW I'M TOO DUMB TO HELP,

133
00:07:18,083 --> 00:07:19,833
BUT IF THERE WAS
SOMETHING I COULD DO

134
00:07:19,916 --> 00:07:21,500
TO CHEER HER UP
EVEN A LITTLE, 

135
00:07:21,583 --> 00:07:23,500
I'D BE HAPPY.

136
00:07:23,583 --> 00:07:26,375
- IF I MAY ASK,
DO YOU THINK YOU LOVE RYOMOU?

137
00:07:26,458 --> 00:07:29,833
- MM.  ABSOLUTELY.
SHE'S MY FRIEND.

138
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:32,791
- Ryofu: YOU LOVE HER
BECAUSE SHE'S YOUR FRIEND?

139
00:07:32,875 --> 00:07:34,375
- SHE'S MY BEST FRIEND.

140
00:07:34,458 --> 00:07:36,041
MOU-CHAN IS, FU-CHIN IS,

141
00:07:36,125 --> 00:07:37,125
KOUKIN IS, CHUUBO IS,

142
00:07:37,208 --> 00:07:39,041
RYU-CHAN IS, KAN-CHAN IS,

143
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:40,208
AND TON-CHAN IS.

144
00:07:40,291 --> 00:07:41,625
THEY'RE ALL MY BEST FRIENDS,

145
00:07:41,708 --> 00:07:42,958
AND I LOVE THEM.

146
00:07:43,041 --> 00:07:45,333
- I HAVE AN IDEA.
I MIGHT KNOW WHERE SHE IS.

147
00:07:45,416 --> 00:07:46,708
- HUH?

148
00:07:46,791 --> 00:07:47,916
REALLY, YOU DO?

149
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,041
- Ryofu: YES.

150
00:07:50,125 --> 00:07:51,375
I'LL TAKE YOU THERE.

151
00:07:53,458 --> 00:07:54,916
- Hakufu:
NOW THAT I THINK OF IT,

152
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,041
MAMA DID SAY SOMETHING ABOUT
MOU-CHAN GOING TO THE MOUNTAINS.

153
00:07:58,125 --> 00:08:00,166
SO SHE'S STILL UP THERE
DOING HER MEDITATION

154
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:01,250
AND TRAINING STUFF.

155
00:08:01,333 --> 00:08:04,375
THAT'S WHERE SHE IS,
FU-CHIN, RIGHT?

156
00:08:17,208 --> 00:08:19,625
THIS IS WHERE
SHE CAME TO TRAIN?

157
00:08:23,083 --> 00:08:24,416
- THAT'S RIGHT.

158
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:27,083
RYOMOU IS THIS WAY.
- OHH?

159
00:08:27,166 --> 00:08:28,250
( gasps )

160
00:08:28,333 --> 00:08:30,291
WAIT!
I'M COMING WITH YOU, FU-CHIN.

161
00:08:30,375 --> 00:08:31,625
HUH?  OH.

162
00:08:39,166 --> 00:08:40,833
FU-CHIN!

163
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:53,500
WHOA, THIS PLACE IS A MESS.

164
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:03,125
FU-CHIN?

165
00:09:08,541 --> 00:09:09,791
OH.

166
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:21,250
( gasps )
MOU-CHAN!

167
00:09:21,333 --> 00:09:23,125
WHAT?
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

168
00:09:23,208 --> 00:09:24,791
WHAT'S WRONG WITH HER?

169
00:09:24,875 --> 00:09:26,291
WHO DID THIS TO MOU-CHAN?

170
00:09:26,375 --> 00:09:28,458
WHY WOULD ANYONE 
WANT TO HURT HER?

171
00:09:28,541 --> 00:09:30,166
- YOU ARE SO STUPID.

172
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:32,458
YOU AND RYOMOU BOTH.
- HUH?

173
00:09:32,541 --> 00:09:35,166
- YOU STILL HAVEN'T FIGURED
IT OUT YET, HAVE YOU?

174
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:37,500
THERE'S NO SUCH THING
AS TRUE FRIENDSHIP.

175
00:09:37,583 --> 00:09:38,791
IT'S ALL A BIG LIE.

176
00:09:38,875 --> 00:09:40,375
PEOPLE JUST USE EACH OTHER.

177
00:09:40,458 --> 00:09:43,875
IT'S USELESS PRETENSE,
AND I INTEND TO DESTROY IT.

178
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:46,000
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

179
00:09:46,083 --> 00:09:47,833
YOU DON'T NORMALLY
TALK LIKE THAT.

180
00:09:47,916 --> 00:09:49,458
( gasps )

181
00:09:49,541 --> 00:09:52,000
- MISS RYOFU AND I WENT
INTO THE HAUNTED HOUSE,

182
00:09:52,083 --> 00:09:54,500
AND THEN SHE...

183
00:09:54,583 --> 00:09:57,625
I WAS LYING DOWN
AND SHE TOUCHED ME.

184
00:09:57,708 --> 00:09:59,833
- Rikuson: BUT REGARDLESS,
SHE'S NOT HERSELF.

185
00:09:59,916 --> 00:10:01,500
SOMEONE IS MANIPULATING HER.

186
00:10:01,583 --> 00:10:03,500
- SHE'S POSSESSED TOO?
BY WHO?

187
00:10:03,583 --> 00:10:05,541
- CAN YOU TELL US ANYTHING,
RIKUSON?

188
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:09,041
IT'S GENPOU SAJI.

189
00:10:09,125 --> 00:10:11,166
- THAT'S RIGHT.
YOU'RE NOT FU-CHIN.

190
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:13,541
YOU HAVEN'T BEEN FU-CHIN
THIS WHOLE TIME.

191
00:10:13,625 --> 00:10:14,583
- CORRECT.

192
00:10:14,666 --> 00:10:17,041
( chuckles )

193
00:10:17,125 --> 00:10:18,375
- YOU WERE RIGHT.

194
00:10:18,458 --> 00:10:20,708
YOU HAVEN'T BEEN WITH
HOUSEN RYOFU AT ALL TODAY.

195
00:10:20,791 --> 00:10:23,041
- ( gasps )

196
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:26,875
HUH?

197
00:10:29,625 --> 00:10:31,416
YOU'RE THAT GIRL I HELPED.

198
00:10:36,708 --> 00:10:38,541
WHY DID YOU RUN AWAY
FROM MY HOUSE?

199
00:10:38,625 --> 00:10:40,208
I WAS WORRIED.

200
00:10:40,291 --> 00:10:42,541
- YOU MADE ME SO HAPPY.

201
00:10:42,625 --> 00:10:44,625
NO ONE HAS EVER BEEN
NICE TO ME BEFORE.

202
00:10:44,708 --> 00:10:46,041
- ( gasps )

203
00:10:46,125 --> 00:10:48,541
- AND YOU WERE WARM
IN A WAY THAT I'VE NEVER FELT.

204
00:10:48,625 --> 00:10:51,041
AND I WANT THAT
ALL FOR MYSELF.

205
00:10:51,125 --> 00:10:53,333
- WHAT?  WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

206
00:10:53,416 --> 00:10:56,416
- RYOMOU CANNOT HAVE YOU.

207
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:58,916
YOU'RE MINE, AND I WANT
WHAT'S INSIDE YOU.

208
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,250
NO ONE ELSE CAN HAVE YOU
EXCEPT ME.

209
00:11:01,333 --> 00:11:02,583
- I DON'T GET IT.

210
00:11:02,666 --> 00:11:05,250
NONE OF THIS IS
MAKING ANY SENSE.

211
00:11:05,333 --> 00:11:06,583
- ( sighs )
- ( gasps )

212
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,625
I... CAN'T MOVE.

213
00:11:10,666 --> 00:11:12,916
- FROM NOW ON,
I AM THE ONLY PERSON

214
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,541
THAT EXISTS FOR YOU.

215
00:11:14,625 --> 00:11:16,875
I, AND I ALONE.

216
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:17,875
- ( shivers )

217
00:11:53,166 --> 00:11:54,750
- Saji: FORGIVE ME, RYOFU.

218
00:11:54,833 --> 00:11:57,583
ALL OF THIS HAPPENED
BECAUSE OF ME.

219
00:11:57,666 --> 00:11:59,291
BECAUSE I LOVED YOU.

220
00:11:59,375 --> 00:12:01,500
AND BECAUSE SHE COULD
SEE MY FEELINGS FOR YOU

221
00:12:01,583 --> 00:12:02,958
BRANDED ON MY SOUL.

222
00:12:03,041 --> 00:12:04,958
WHEN YOU REAPPEARED
IN THIS WORLD,

223
00:12:05,041 --> 00:12:06,958
I COULD HARDLY
BELIEVE MY EYES,

224
00:12:07,041 --> 00:12:08,916
AND SO I MADE
MY DEAL WITH THE DEVIL.

225
00:12:11,375 --> 00:12:13,958
NOW FIGHTERS EVERYWHERE
ARE SUFFERING THE WRATH

226
00:12:14,041 --> 00:12:15,625
OF THE NECROMANCER,

227
00:12:15,708 --> 00:12:18,833
THE REAL GENPOU SAJI.

228
00:12:18,916 --> 00:12:20,375
HER CURSE IS INFECTING THEM.

229
00:12:20,458 --> 00:12:22,541
HER VENGEANCE
AND HATRED SPREADS.

230
00:12:25,208 --> 00:12:27,666
PERHAPS I SHOULD HAVE
LISTENED TO SHISONZUI

231
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:29,041
WHEN I HAD THE CHANCE.

232
00:12:29,125 --> 00:12:31,541
ALL I CAN DO NOW
IS WAIT FOR THAT DESTINY

233
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:33,000
TO PLAY ITSELF OUT.

234
00:12:33,083 --> 00:12:34,666
DAMN IT.

235
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:36,000
ANY WAY THIS ENDS,

236
00:12:36,083 --> 00:12:38,000
SOMEONE WON'T
COME OUT OF IT ALIVE.

237
00:12:38,083 --> 00:12:40,875
- ( cellphone ringing )

238
00:12:40,958 --> 00:12:43,750
- IT'S NO USE.
SHE'S NOT ANSWERING HER PHONE.

239
00:12:43,833 --> 00:12:46,208
- WHERE COULD BIG SISTER
HAKUFU HAVE GONE?

240
00:12:46,291 --> 00:12:47,541
SHE ISN'T ANYWHERE.

241
00:12:47,625 --> 00:12:49,666
- I DON'T KNOW.
I HAVE A BAD FEELING ABOUT IT.

242
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:51,333
I REALLY HOPE
THAT I'M WRONG.

243
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:15,375
- OH.
- HUH?

244
00:13:15,458 --> 00:13:16,916
( gasps )

245
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,208
HAKUFU!

246
00:13:18,291 --> 00:13:20,375
- BIG SISTER,
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

247
00:13:20,458 --> 00:13:22,125
- WHY HAVEN'T YOU 
CALLED US ALL DAY?

248
00:13:22,208 --> 00:13:23,291
WE WERE WORRIED
ABOUT YOU.

249
00:13:23,375 --> 00:13:26,375
- OH, YOU WERE WORRIED?

250
00:13:26,458 --> 00:13:28,708
SO SORRY YOU
TROUBLED YOURSELVES.

251
00:13:28,791 --> 00:13:32,541
BUT IF I'M SO WEAK THAT INFERIOR
FIGHTERS WORRY ABOUT ME,

252
00:13:32,625 --> 00:13:34,750
I GUESS MY DAYS AS
THE LITTLE CONQUEROR

253
00:13:34,833 --> 00:13:36,000
ARE AT AN END.

254
00:13:36,083 --> 00:13:38,708
- WHAT?  WHAT ARE YOU 
TALKING ABOUT, HAKUFU?

255
00:13:38,791 --> 00:13:42,500
- BIG BROTHER,
THAT'S NOT OUR BIG SISTER.

256
00:13:42,583 --> 00:13:44,250
I KNOW IT.
- BEING A LEADER

257
00:13:44,333 --> 00:13:46,041
IS NOTHING BUT DOING 
A WHOLE BUNCH OF CRAP

258
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:47,583
TO PROTECT MY
WEAK UNDERLINGS.

259
00:13:47,666 --> 00:13:49,416
I'VE GROWN TIRED OF IT.

260
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,916
WHY DON'T YOU FIND
SOMEONE ELSE WHO GIVES A SHIT?

261
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,500
MAYBE YOU SHOULD HAVE
THAT BONEHEADED GORILLA,

262
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:56,500
GAKU-CHAN,
TAKE OVER FOR ME?

263
00:13:56,583 --> 00:13:58,291
- WHAT'S GOTTEN INTO YOU?

264
00:13:58,375 --> 00:14:00,083
- ( sighs )

265
00:14:00,166 --> 00:14:02,041
SUN TZU TEACHES US

266
00:14:02,125 --> 00:14:04,250
"ATTACK THE ENEMY
BEFORE HE CAN ATTACK YOU."

267
00:14:04,333 --> 00:14:05,583
- HUH?

268
00:14:05,666 --> 00:14:07,958
- THE ART OF WAR IS TO
ATTACK AN ENEMY'S PLAN

269
00:14:08,041 --> 00:14:09,583
BEFORE HE CAN
PUT IT INTO ACTION

270
00:14:09,666 --> 00:14:11,166
AND USE IT AGAINST YOU.

271
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:13,500
IT WOULD APPEAR
THAT IN THIS BATTLE

272
00:14:13,583 --> 00:14:16,375
THE ENEMY'S STRATEGY IS TO 
LOOK LIKE BIG SISTER HAKUFU

273
00:14:16,458 --> 00:14:17,500
IN ORDER TO CONFUSE US.

274
00:14:17,583 --> 00:14:20,500
- HAKUFU IS NOT REALLY HAKUFU.

275
00:14:20,583 --> 00:14:22,458
- OH?  SO...

276
00:14:22,541 --> 00:14:23,708
YOU FOUND ME OUT.

277
00:14:23,791 --> 00:14:26,125
YOU CAN TELL.
I SEE.

278
00:14:26,208 --> 00:14:29,000
- BIG SISTER HAKUFU HAS BEEN
POSSESSED AND TAKEN OVER

279
00:14:29,083 --> 00:14:30,333
JUST LIKE MISS RYUUBI WAS.

280
00:14:30,416 --> 00:14:33,208
BY GENPOU SAJI!

281
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:37,666
- TRY AND STOP ME THEN,
KOUKIN.

282
00:14:40,541 --> 00:14:41,416
- ( gasps )

283
00:14:45,416 --> 00:14:46,875
- ( grunting )

284
00:14:50,833 --> 00:14:51,916
- ( gasps )

285
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,541
- ( grunting continues )

286
00:14:58,208 --> 00:15:00,208
- HAKUFU,
RESIST THE MIND CONTROL.

287
00:15:00,291 --> 00:15:01,791
- KOUKIN...

288
00:15:01,875 --> 00:15:03,500
YOU'RE HURTING ME.

289
00:15:03,583 --> 00:15:05,166
IT'S ME, KOUKIN.

290
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:06,333
YOUR HAKUFU.

291
00:15:06,416 --> 00:15:07,458
- ( gasps )

292
00:15:07,541 --> 00:15:08,625
- MY KOUKIN.

293
00:15:10,416 --> 00:15:11,833
- BE CAREFUL,
BIG BROTHER! 

294
00:15:11,916 --> 00:15:13,375
- ( gasps )

295
00:15:18,625 --> 00:15:20,041
WERE YOU PLANNING
TO KISS ME

296
00:15:20,125 --> 00:15:21,500
AND GET CONTROL
OVER ME TOO?

297
00:15:21,583 --> 00:15:23,166
- THAT'S RIGHT.

298
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:24,708
TOO BAD.

299
00:15:24,791 --> 00:15:26,125
IF YOU HADN'T STOPPED ME,
KOUKIN,

300
00:15:26,208 --> 00:15:28,458
YOU WOULD HAVE GOTTEN
THE CHANCE TO TASTE HER.

301
00:15:28,541 --> 00:15:30,500
- HOW DARE YOU.

302
00:15:30,583 --> 00:15:32,125
IS THIS FUN FOR YOU?

303
00:15:32,208 --> 00:15:34,333
WHAT KIND OF
TWISTED PERSON ARE YOU

304
00:15:34,416 --> 00:15:35,791
THAT YOU'RE ENJOYING THIS?

305
00:15:35,875 --> 00:15:38,166
- TWISTED, AM I?
THAT'S RIGHT.

306
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:39,791
I'M A HORRIBLE FREAK SHOW.

307
00:15:39,875 --> 00:15:42,833
WHEN I MANIPULATE
HAPPY AND FUN-LOVING PEOPLE

308
00:15:42,916 --> 00:15:44,708
INTO STATES OF
DISCORD AND MISERY,

309
00:15:44,791 --> 00:15:46,708
I DO RATHER ENJOY IT.

310
00:15:46,791 --> 00:15:48,416
- WHERE IS IT?

311
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:50,541
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE WITH 
THE REAL HAKUFU'S SOUL?!

312
00:15:51,958 --> 00:15:53,541
- HMM.

313
00:15:53,625 --> 00:15:55,875
ALL THOSE WHO ARE
UNDER MY CONTROL 

314
00:15:55,958 --> 00:15:58,958
SLEEP IN A DARK WORLD
FROM WHICH THERE IS NO WAKING.

315
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:01,541
YOU CAN CALL OUT TO HER
UNTIL YOU LOSE YOUR VOICE.

316
00:16:01,625 --> 00:16:05,708
BUT HAKUFU SONSAKU'S SOUL 
WILL NEVER BE COMING BACK.

317
00:16:05,791 --> 00:16:07,208
- BIG BROTHER,
PLEASE LISTEN.

318
00:16:07,291 --> 00:16:09,541
GENPOU SAJI WANTS TO
TEAR US APART.

319
00:16:09,625 --> 00:16:12,750
YOU MUST SHOW HER
HOW STRONG OUR FRIENDSHIP IS.

320
00:16:12,833 --> 00:16:14,625
- ( grunting )

321
00:16:18,625 --> 00:16:19,875
- HA!
- ( gasps )

322
00:16:19,958 --> 00:16:21,916
( grunts )

323
00:16:23,291 --> 00:16:25,208
- ( laughs )

324
00:16:25,291 --> 00:16:27,083
( gasps )
- CHUUBO!

325
00:16:27,166 --> 00:16:28,458
GET AWAY FROM HERE.

326
00:16:28,541 --> 00:16:29,666
YOU'RE NO MATCH
FOR HER.

327
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:31,250
- NO, BIG BROTHER.

328
00:16:31,333 --> 00:16:33,250
I AM NOT GOING
TO RUN AWAY.

329
00:16:33,333 --> 00:16:34,916
I MAY NOT HAVE
A FIGHTER'S STRENGTH

330
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,916
LIKE YOURS OR
BIG SISTER HAKUFU'S,

331
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,083
BUT I AM STILL
YOUR YOUNGER SISTER.

332
00:16:39,166 --> 00:16:41,125
I AM CHUUBO SONKEN,

333
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:43,458
AND I WILL PROTECT
MY BIG BROTHER OR DIE.

334
00:16:43,541 --> 00:16:45,583
- ( laughing )

335
00:16:45,666 --> 00:16:48,125
THAT'S BIG TALK FOR SUCH
A PATHETIC LITTLE GIRL. 

336
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:49,791
AS YOU WISH.

337
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
- ( screams )

338
00:16:54,666 --> 00:16:56,333
( gasps )

339
00:16:56,416 --> 00:16:57,916
- THERE.

340
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,791
THAT WASN'T EVEN CLOSE TO
THE FULL EXTENT OF MY POWER,

341
00:17:00,875 --> 00:17:02,750
AND YET YOU STILL
COULDN'T GET NEAR ME.

342
00:17:02,833 --> 00:17:05,625
YOU'RE FAR TOO WEAK
TO PROTECT ANYONE. 

343
00:17:09,041 --> 00:17:11,333
- IF I AM WEAK,
THEN YOU ARE EVEN WEAKER.

344
00:17:11,416 --> 00:17:12,625
- ( gasps )

345
00:17:12,708 --> 00:17:14,625
- GENPOU SAJI,

346
00:17:14,708 --> 00:17:16,458
YOURS IS A PITIFUL SOUL.

347
00:17:16,541 --> 00:17:19,791
THE ONLY WAY YOU KNOW HOW TO 
COMMUNICATE WITH OTHER PEOPLE

348
00:17:19,875 --> 00:17:21,291
IS BY HURTING THEM.

349
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:23,041
- ( grunts )

350
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:25,625
- YOU FEAR PEOPLE.
I UNDERSTAND.

351
00:17:25,708 --> 00:17:26,958
BUT YOUR FEAR,

352
00:17:27,041 --> 00:17:29,375
THAT MADE THE PEOPLE
AROUND YOU AFRAID TOO.

353
00:17:35,541 --> 00:17:37,291
- ( gasps )

354
00:17:37,375 --> 00:17:38,625
SHUT YOUR MOUTH!

355
00:17:41,041 --> 00:17:42,375
HA!

356
00:17:42,458 --> 00:17:44,291
( screams )

357
00:17:44,375 --> 00:17:47,416
( panting )

358
00:17:49,041 --> 00:17:50,375
I SUFFERED!

359
00:17:50,458 --> 00:17:53,333
EVERYBODY TREATED ME
LIKE AN OUTCAST.

360
00:17:53,416 --> 00:17:54,833
THEY SHUNNED
AND AVOIDED ME

361
00:17:54,916 --> 00:17:56,333
AND TURNED ME INTO
A PARIAH.

362
00:17:56,416 --> 00:17:58,333
THAT'S WHY
I MADE THEM SUFFER.

363
00:17:58,416 --> 00:18:00,291
THEY HAD TO SUFFER
LIKE I DID.

364
00:18:00,375 --> 00:18:02,291
YOU'RE AFRAID OF ME TOO,
AREN'T YOU?

365
00:18:02,375 --> 00:18:06,000
GO!  HURRY UP AND RUN AWAY
LIKE EVERYONE ELSE.

366
00:18:06,083 --> 00:18:08,083
- NO, CHUUBO.
STAY DOWN.

367
00:18:08,166 --> 00:18:10,000
- I WON'T LEAVE.
I'LL FIGHT.

368
00:18:10,083 --> 00:18:11,666
I'LL FIGHT

369
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:13,958
TO SAVE MY BIG BROTHER.

370
00:18:14,041 --> 00:18:15,333
AND I'LL FIGHT

371
00:18:15,416 --> 00:18:17,791
FOR THE SAKE OF MY
BIG SISTER HAKUFU.

372
00:18:19,416 --> 00:18:22,000
- WHAT?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

373
00:18:22,083 --> 00:18:25,458
- I WON'T RUN AWAY.
SHE NEEDS ME.

374
00:18:25,541 --> 00:18:27,666
- ( gasps )

375
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:29,291
STAY AWAY!

376
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:33,583
- ( screams )

377
00:18:40,458 --> 00:18:43,208
BIG SISTER HAKUFU...

378
00:18:44,458 --> 00:18:47,208
CAN YOU SEE ME,
SISTER?

379
00:18:47,291 --> 00:18:49,708
CAN YOU HEAR MY VOICE?

380
00:18:49,791 --> 00:18:52,125
PLEASE WAKE UP.

381
00:18:52,208 --> 00:18:53,375
- ( gasps )

382
00:18:53,458 --> 00:18:54,708
- WE NEED OUR HAKUFU BACK

383
00:18:54,791 --> 00:18:57,041
WHO IS HAPPY AND KIND.

384
00:18:57,125 --> 00:18:58,708
PLEASE, BIG SISTER.

385
00:18:58,791 --> 00:19:00,583
COME BACK TO ME!

386
00:19:06,125 --> 00:19:08,250
- ( gasps )

387
00:19:08,333 --> 00:19:10,458
- ( crying )

388
00:19:13,958 --> 00:19:15,500
- ( sobbing )

389
00:19:17,416 --> 00:19:18,625
( sighs )

390
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:24,250
- Koukin: HAKUFU!
- WAKE UP.

391
00:19:24,333 --> 00:19:25,541
PLEASE WAKE UP.

392
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,416
- ( groans )
- ( gasps )

393
00:19:31,833 --> 00:19:33,416
- CHUUBO.

394
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:35,416
- ( chuckling )
- YOU'RE BACK. 

395
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:37,416
THANK GOODNESS.
YOU HAD US SCARED.

396
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,083
- WELCOME BACK,
BIG SISTER.

397
00:19:39,166 --> 00:19:40,250
I KNEW YOU COULD DO IT.

398
00:19:41,833 --> 00:19:43,750
- I HEARD YOUR VOICE,
CHUUBO.

399
00:19:43,833 --> 00:19:45,708
I HEARD YOU
CALLING OUT TO ME.

400
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:47,166
BUT SHE...

401
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:49,375
HAD CONTROL OF ME.

402
00:19:49,458 --> 00:19:51,083
THERE WAS NOTHING
I COULD DO.

403
00:19:51,166 --> 00:19:53,083
I FELT SO HELPLESS.

404
00:19:53,166 --> 00:19:55,458
HER SOUL IN ME
WAS FRIGHTENING.

405
00:19:55,541 --> 00:19:57,708
AND SHE WAS SO
TERRIBLY SAD. 

406
00:19:57,791 --> 00:20:00,458
I-- I'M SORRY.

407
00:20:00,541 --> 00:20:02,125
LOOK AT YOU TWO.

408
00:20:02,208 --> 00:20:05,125
YOU'RE BOTH BRUISED
AND BEATEN UP.

409
00:20:05,208 --> 00:20:07,500
AND IT'S ALL BECAUSE OF ME.

410
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:11,458
( sobbing )

411
00:20:12,708 --> 00:20:13,875
- HEY, CALM DOWN.

412
00:20:13,958 --> 00:20:14,916
THERE'S NO NEED FOR
THE WATER WORKS.

413
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,791
EVERYTHING'S OKAY NOW.

414
00:20:19,958 --> 00:20:21,791
- ( sobbing continues )

415
00:20:33,875 --> 00:20:35,791
- Koukin: LOOK AT YOU. 
YOUR FACE IS ALL DIRTY.

416
00:20:35,875 --> 00:20:37,000
HOLD STILL.

417
00:20:37,083 --> 00:20:39,666
- THANKS FOR THE HELP,
KOUKIN.

418
00:20:40,916 --> 00:20:42,875
( gasps )

419
00:20:42,958 --> 00:20:45,833
KOUKIN!  OH, NO,
YOU'RE BLEEDING!

420
00:20:45,916 --> 00:20:48,125
- ( gasps, grunts )

421
00:20:48,208 --> 00:20:52,250
- FIRST, LET'S WIPE IT OFF AND
CLEAN THE WOUND A LITTLE BIT. 

422
00:20:52,333 --> 00:20:55,625
NEXT, WE NEED SOMETHING
TO USE AS A BANDAGE.

423
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:04,166
THERE.  ALL DONE.

424
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:05,500
- OH.

425
00:21:05,583 --> 00:21:07,166
THAT'S BETTER.
THANK YOU.

426
00:21:09,208 --> 00:21:11,166
CHUUBO?
- HUH?

427
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:13,666
- I OWE YOU AN APOLOGY.
- HUH?

428
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:15,166
- HONESTLY,

429
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:16,791
EVER SINCE
THE FIRST DAY YOU CAME

430
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:18,625
I DIDN'T REALLY BELIEVE
THAT YOU AND HAKUFU

431
00:21:18,708 --> 00:21:20,458
WERE TRUE SISTERS
OR EVEN RELATED. 

432
00:21:20,541 --> 00:21:22,208
BUT AFTER SEEING
WHAT YOU DID,

433
00:21:22,291 --> 00:21:23,708
I'M SORRY
I EVER DOUBTED YOU.

434
00:21:23,791 --> 00:21:24,708
- UH?

435
00:21:24,791 --> 00:21:26,166
- BRINGING HAKUFU
BACK LIKE THAT,

436
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:27,541
I CAN SEE THERE WAS A BOND.

437
00:21:27,625 --> 00:21:29,500
YOU TWO REALLY ARE SISTERS.

438
00:21:29,583 --> 00:21:30,791
- ( gasps )

439
00:21:30,875 --> 00:21:32,875
- Hakufu: KOUKIN,
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

440
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:34,708
DID SOMETHING HAPPEN
WITH CHUUBO?

441
00:21:34,791 --> 00:21:36,708
- BIG SISTER HAKUFU,

442
00:21:36,791 --> 00:21:38,541
BIG BROTHER KOUKIN,

443
00:21:38,625 --> 00:21:40,208
I HAVE A SECRET,

444
00:21:40,291 --> 00:21:42,541
AND I KNEW ONE DAY
I WOULD HAVE TO TELL

445
00:21:42,625 --> 00:21:44,875
WHAT THE TRUTH IS.

446
00:21:44,958 --> 00:21:47,208
I'M NOT WHO
YOU THINK I AM.

447
00:21:47,291 --> 00:21:48,916
- ( end theme playing )

449
00:23:19,208 --> 00:23:20,958
- Chuubo:
BIG SISTER HAKUFU,

450
00:23:21,041 --> 00:23:22,458
BIG BROTHER KOUKIN,

451
00:23:22,541 --> 00:23:24,541
WHEN I SUDDENLY
DROPPED INTO YOUR LIVES

452
00:23:24,625 --> 00:23:27,375
AND ANNOUNCED THAT I WAS
YOUR YOUNGER SISTER,

453
00:23:27,458 --> 00:23:30,041
YOU WELCOMED ME AND TREATED ME
WITH KINDNESS AND AFFECTION.

454
00:23:30,125 --> 00:23:32,666
I WAS SO GRATEFUL
AND HAPPY.

455
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:35,083
I LOVED BEING
PART OF YOUR FAMILY.

456
00:23:35,166 --> 00:23:36,666
THAT'S WHY...

457
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:39,333
I CANNOT CONTINUE
TO LIE TO YOU ANY LONGER.

458
00:23:39,416 --> 00:23:42,000
I'VE BEEN HIDING SOMETHING
FROM YOU THIS WHOLE TIME.

459
00:23:42,083 --> 00:23:44,416
THE TRUTH IS...
