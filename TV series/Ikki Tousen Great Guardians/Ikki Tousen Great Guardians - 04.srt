1
00:01:55,708 --> 00:01:58,583
- KAN'U, WE CAN'T
DO THIS HERE.

2
00:01:58,666 --> 00:02:01,458
WHAT IF SOMEONE COMES?
THEY'LL SEE US.

3
00:02:01,541 --> 00:02:04,375
- GENTOKU.

4
00:02:07,666 --> 00:02:09,208
- ( moaning )

5
00:02:15,333 --> 00:02:17,125
- WAIT.  NOT YET.

6
00:02:17,208 --> 00:02:21,625
WAIT, KAN'U,
KISS ME FIRST.

7
00:02:31,375 --> 00:02:34,250
- ( crow squawking )
- HUH?

8
00:02:34,333 --> 00:02:37,125
HMM?

9
00:02:37,208 --> 00:02:39,166
- HERE, KOUMEI.

10
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:41,500
- KOUMEI?
WHO INVITED HER?

11
00:02:41,583 --> 00:02:44,875
- I DID.  I PROMISED KOUMEI
THAT I WOULD LEND HER THAT BOOK.

12
00:02:44,958 --> 00:02:46,791
- WHAT?
GENTOKU!

13
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:48,541
I NEED TO KNOW HOW
YOU FEEL ABOUT ME.

14
00:02:48,625 --> 00:02:50,083
I NEED TO KNOW RIGHT NOW.

15
00:02:50,166 --> 00:02:52,250
- YOU'RE SCARING ME, KAN'U!
( crying )

16
00:03:07,041 --> 00:03:09,125
- IT WAS A DREAM.

17
00:03:20,125 --> 00:03:22,041
GENTOKU.

18
00:03:34,333 --> 00:03:35,958
HUH?

19
00:03:37,625 --> 00:03:40,416
- Girl: EXCUSE ME.
- HUH?

20
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,708
- UM, HI, MISS KAN'U, SIR.

21
00:03:42,791 --> 00:03:44,500
YOU DON'T KNOW ME.
MY NAME IS SHUUSOU

22
00:03:44,583 --> 00:03:47,791
AND I'M A FIRST-YEAR STUDENT
HERE. YOU'RE SO COOL.

23
00:03:47,875 --> 00:03:50,083
AND I'VE ALWAYS LOOKED UP
TO YOU IN AWE.

24
00:03:50,166 --> 00:03:52,541
PLEASE ACCEPT
THIS PRESENT FROM ME! AHH!

25
00:03:54,583 --> 00:03:56,541
- DID YOU SEE? 
I GAVE IT TO HER!

26
00:03:56,625 --> 00:04:00,250
- AH-HA-HA!  MAN, YOU SURE
GOT A GIGANTIC HAUL TODAY.

27
00:04:00,333 --> 00:04:02,916
I'M GOING TO GET FAT
FROM EATING ALL OF YOUR GOODIES.

28
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,833
KAN'U?

29
00:04:04,916 --> 00:04:06,625
- EKITOKU?
WHEN DID YOU GET HERE?

30
00:04:06,708 --> 00:04:09,375
- AH?  WELL, WHATEVER.

31
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:11,166
THE OLD MAN
IS LOOKING FOR YOU.

32
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:13,500
- YOU MEAN MASTER SUIKYOU?

33
00:04:13,583 --> 00:04:15,833
- Ekitoku:
DOING SOME SPRING CLEANING?

34
00:04:15,916 --> 00:04:18,000
- I MUST GO OUT
TO BUY MORE SAKE.

35
00:04:18,083 --> 00:04:21,125
I'M COUNTING ON YOU TO GET ALL
OF THIS CLEANING DONE FOR ME.

36
00:04:21,208 --> 00:04:23,208
HAVE FUN.
- THIS SUCKS!

37
00:04:23,291 --> 00:04:25,375
OUR UNIFORMS ARE GOING
TO GET ALL COVERED IN DUST.

38
00:04:25,458 --> 00:04:27,416
DON'T YOU HATE THAT?

39
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,583
ARGH!  KAN'U.

40
00:04:29,666 --> 00:04:30,958
- OH.

41
00:04:31,041 --> 00:04:33,458
WHERE IS MASTER SUIKYOU?
DID HE GO OUT SOMEWHERE?

42
00:04:33,541 --> 00:04:34,708
- HUH?

43
00:04:34,791 --> 00:04:37,125
KAN'U, YOU'VE BEEN ZONING OUT
A LOT LATELY.

44
00:04:37,208 --> 00:04:39,166
ARE YOU SURE
YOU'RE FEELING OKAY?

45
00:04:41,375 --> 00:04:43,125
- ( honks )

46
00:04:43,208 --> 00:04:45,125
- SEITO ACADEMY
ISN'T MUCH FURTHER.

47
00:04:45,208 --> 00:04:47,250
WE'RE ALMOST THERE.
- GREAT.

48
00:04:47,333 --> 00:04:49,958
- YOU'RE REALLY SURE
IT'S OKAY TO GO THERE?

49
00:04:50,041 --> 00:04:52,750
- DON'T FORGET WHAT HAPPENED
THE LAST TIME YOU SAW KAN'U.

50
00:04:52,833 --> 00:04:54,666
- NO MORE TALK!

51
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:57,666
- DAMN YOU!

52
00:04:59,958 --> 00:05:02,750
- THIS MEETING IS TO BOLSTER
GOODWILL AND FRIENDSHIP,

53
00:05:02,833 --> 00:05:04,916
SO NOTHING LIKE THAT
IS GONNA HAPPEN TODAY.

54
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
DON'T WORRY.
- EASY FOR YOU TO SAY.

55
00:05:07,083 --> 00:05:10,791
- OH, AND I'M JUST SO EXCITED 
TO GET TO MEET GENTOKU RYUUBI.

56
00:05:10,875 --> 00:05:12,791
AND I LOVED HER IDEA
TO BRING LUNCH

57
00:05:12,875 --> 00:05:14,833
BECAUSE FRIENDSHIP
GROWS BETTER ON A FULL STOMACH.

58
00:05:14,916 --> 00:05:17,708
- IT SURE DOES!
- ( both chuckle )

59
00:05:17,791 --> 00:05:19,458
- ( sighs )

60
00:05:19,541 --> 00:05:22,000
IF THIS KEEPS UP,
ALL THESE LUNCHES,

61
00:05:22,083 --> 00:05:24,291
THERE'LL BE NO MONEY
FOR ANYTHING ELSE.

62
00:05:24,375 --> 00:05:26,000
I ALMOST FORGOT--

63
00:05:26,083 --> 00:05:28,541
IT'S TIME
FOR MY BALLROOM DANCING LESSON.

64
00:05:28,625 --> 00:05:31,958
THE TEACHER IS SO LEAN
AND MUSCULAR-- EXACTLY MY TYPE.

65
00:05:32,041 --> 00:05:34,375
- ( rustling )

66
00:05:37,791 --> 00:05:40,166
- WHOA!

67
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:43,833
PERFECT.  NOW I'VE GOT
EVEN MORE WORK TO DO!

68
00:05:45,875 --> 00:05:48,125
OOH!  HOW PRETTY.

69
00:05:48,208 --> 00:05:51,208
I BET THIS IS WORTH A BUCK
OR TWO.

70
00:05:51,291 --> 00:05:53,375
( laughs )

71
00:05:55,333 --> 00:05:56,541
HUH?

72
00:06:04,208 --> 00:06:05,541
AHH!

73
00:06:05,625 --> 00:06:08,541
- I DIDN'T MEAN TO.
- OH MY!

74
00:06:08,625 --> 00:06:11,291
( whimpers )

75
00:06:11,375 --> 00:06:13,916
- I'M EMBARRASSED.

76
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,500
- WHA-- 

77
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:18,875
UH, I'M SO SORRY, MISS.
PLEASE LET ME HELP YOU UP.

78
00:06:18,958 --> 00:06:20,083
- OH!  PERVERT!

79
00:06:20,166 --> 00:06:21,500
HOW COULD YOU THINK
I WOULD TOUCH YOUR HAND?

80
00:06:21,583 --> 00:06:23,583
IF I DID, WE'D HAVE
TO GET MARRIED!

81
00:06:23,666 --> 00:06:24,625
- WE WHAT?

82
00:06:24,708 --> 00:06:26,750
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

83
00:06:26,833 --> 00:06:28,625
EKITOKU?
- OH?

84
00:06:28,708 --> 00:06:30,125
- WHAT'S WITH
THAT STUPID NECKLACE?

85
00:06:30,208 --> 00:06:32,583
IT CLASHES WITH YOUR UNIFORM.
TAKE IT OFF.

86
00:06:32,666 --> 00:06:34,416
- HOW RUDE OF YOU.
- WHAT?

87
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:38,416
- A LADY MUST SPEAK PROPER AND
GENTEEL LANGUAGE AT ALL TIMES.

88
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,666
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE HELL
YOU'RE PLAYING AT.

89
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:42,041
COME ON.
- OW!

90
00:06:42,125 --> 00:06:45,083
THAT HURTS.
LET GO!

91
00:06:45,166 --> 00:06:46,958
- IT MUST BE THE NECKLACE.

92
00:06:47,041 --> 00:06:48,833
- AH!

93
00:06:51,541 --> 00:06:54,500
HUH?  THAT'S WEIRD.
HOW'D I END UP ON THE FLOOR?

94
00:06:54,583 --> 00:06:56,375
- DON'T YOU REMEMBER
WHAT JUST HAPPENED?

95
00:06:56,458 --> 00:06:59,208
- NO.  DID I DO SOMETHING?
- ( both gasp )

96
00:06:59,291 --> 00:07:01,250
- THIS THING IS EVIL.

97
00:07:01,333 --> 00:07:04,000
- ACTUALLY, THAT IS
A HEART-REVEALING STONE.

98
00:07:04,083 --> 00:07:05,125
- All: HUH?

99
00:07:05,208 --> 00:07:06,916
- WHAT'S
A HEART-REVEALING STONE?

100
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,041
- IT IS A MAGICAL
STONE THAT REVEALS

101
00:07:09,125 --> 00:07:11,291
THE TRUE NATURE OF
THOSE WHO TOUCH IT.

102
00:07:11,375 --> 00:07:12,500
- All: WHAT?

103
00:07:12,583 --> 00:07:14,416
- FOR THOSE WHO DARE
TO PUT ON THAT NECKLACE,

104
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:15,666
IT WILL BRING THEIR DEEPEST,

105
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:18,125
MOST HIDDEN DESIRES
TO THE SURFACE.

106
00:07:18,208 --> 00:07:20,416
THEN THEIR INNER-MOST FEELINGS
WILL POSSESS THEM.

107
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:23,083
- THAT CAN'T BE TRUE.

108
00:07:23,166 --> 00:07:24,958
HUH?
- ( giggling )

109
00:07:25,041 --> 00:07:27,791
- BOOB SQUEEZE!
- AAH!

110
00:07:27,875 --> 00:07:30,291
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING?!

111
00:07:30,375 --> 00:07:33,500
- HEY, HEY, BABY!

112
00:07:33,583 --> 00:07:36,083
DON'T PRETEND YOU DON'T LIKE IT
WHEN YOU KNOW YOU WANT IT.

113
00:07:36,166 --> 00:07:37,791
- Both: HUH?

114
00:07:37,875 --> 00:07:39,083
- Kan'u: EKITOKU, LOOK.

115
00:07:39,166 --> 00:07:41,333
- Ekitoku: HE PUT
THE NECKLACE ON!

116
00:07:41,416 --> 00:07:44,666
- YO, CHOUPI!
MMM, GIRL, YOU FINE!

117
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:46,958
YOU SO HOT, YOU SIZZLE.
OOH, YOU MAKE ME BURN.

118
00:07:47,041 --> 00:07:48,375
THAT'S RIGHT, GIRL,
I'M MELTING!

119
00:07:48,458 --> 00:07:50,791
- SO THIS
IS KOUCHUU'S TRUE SELF?

120
00:07:50,875 --> 00:07:54,166
- THAT'S WHAT IT SEEMS LIKE.
- HE'S JUST A PERVERTED PRIEST.

121
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:56,583
- YO!  HOW 'BOUT I GET
UP IN YO' GRILL,

122
00:07:56,666 --> 00:07:59,791
SHOW YOU SOME A DEM FLY MOVES

123
00:07:59,875 --> 00:08:02,125
- HEY, GET OFF!

124
00:08:02,208 --> 00:08:04,166
- OH!

125
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:06,666
- SNAP OUT OF IT ALREADY,
YOU IDIOT!

126
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:08,458
- I'M BACK, BABY!

127
00:08:08,541 --> 00:08:10,375
GETTING HIT BY YOU
IS LIKE FOREPLAY.

128
00:08:10,458 --> 00:08:12,875
- YOU WANT ANOTHER RIGHT HOOK?

129
00:08:12,958 --> 00:08:14,208
- MAYBE LATER.
- WHAT ARE YOU--

130
00:08:14,291 --> 00:08:17,541
- HEY, KAN-CHAN.
CHOUPI BE ILLIN', BUT I CHILL!

131
00:08:17,625 --> 00:08:18,916
SO HOW 'BOUT YOU, GIRL?

132
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,333
I KNOW YOU GOTTA WANNA TASTE
THE TALL DARK AND SWEET.

133
00:08:22,416 --> 00:08:24,750
MMM!

134
00:08:24,833 --> 00:08:28,250
OOH, HEY, BABY,
YOU GOT A ROCKIN' RACK ON YOU.

135
00:08:28,333 --> 00:08:30,875
- AHH!

136
00:08:33,583 --> 00:08:34,708
AH!

137
00:08:34,791 --> 00:08:37,708
- ( grunts )

138
00:08:38,916 --> 00:08:41,916
WHAT DID I DO?

139
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,833
- DROP DEAD, YOU PERVERT!
YOU'LL PAY FOR THAT.

140
00:08:44,916 --> 00:08:48,166
HYAH!
- AHH!

141
00:08:49,791 --> 00:08:53,250
- MAY HE REST IN PEACE.

142
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:07,458
- ( grunts )

143
00:09:07,541 --> 00:09:10,083
I THINK THAT'S THE LAST ONE.

144
00:09:10,166 --> 00:09:14,041
- GREAT!
TAKE FIVE.

145
00:09:14,125 --> 00:09:15,958
- HUH?

146
00:09:16,041 --> 00:09:19,750
- ( whimpering )

147
00:09:22,333 --> 00:09:24,291
HERE.
THIS IS THE BOOK I PROMISED YOU.

148
00:09:24,375 --> 00:09:25,375
THANKS FOR WAITING.

149
00:09:28,833 --> 00:09:32,083
- Kan'u: GENTOKU, YOU REALLY
HAVE NO IDEA, DO YOU?

150
00:09:32,166 --> 00:09:34,625
- WHAT'S THE MATTER, KAN'U?

151
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:37,208
- IT'S NOTHING.

152
00:09:37,291 --> 00:09:39,250
- Ekitoku: KAN'U HAS
BEEN SPACING OUT A LOT.

153
00:09:39,333 --> 00:09:41,250
I'M WORRIED SHE MIGHT
BE SICK OR SOMETHING.

154
00:09:41,333 --> 00:09:43,333
- REALLY?
THAT'S NOT GOOD.

155
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:45,375
HMM.

156
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,583
HMM.

157
00:09:51,666 --> 00:09:54,333
NOT HOT, NO FEVER.

158
00:09:54,416 --> 00:09:57,041
- Koumei: GENTOKU?

159
00:09:57,125 --> 00:09:58,916
- YES?
- LET'S GO.

160
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,416
- OKAY, I'M COMING.

161
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,583
- WAIT. YOU'RE GOING
SOMEWHERE WITH KOUMEI?

162
00:10:02,666 --> 00:10:04,083
- THE WEATHER IS SO NICE.

163
00:10:04,166 --> 00:10:05,916
SO I THOUGHT I'D TAKE HER
TO THAT SPOT IN THE MOUNTAINS

164
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,708
UNDER THE BIG TREE
WHERE I LIKE TO GO READ.

165
00:10:07,791 --> 00:10:09,666
- YOU SURE DO LIKE READING.

166
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:13,000
- AND YOU SURE DO LIKE EATING,
CHOUHI. DO YOU WANNA GET FAT?

167
00:10:13,083 --> 00:10:14,333
- MIND YOUR OWN BUSINESS,
BOOK WORM,

168
00:10:14,416 --> 00:10:15,583
OR I'LL KICK YOUR BUTT.

169
00:10:15,666 --> 00:10:18,125
- OH, PLEASE MISS CHUBBY
PANTS, DON'T SPANK ME!

170
00:10:18,208 --> 00:10:20,958
- I SAID KICK YOUR BUTT!
- OH!  KOUMEI, HELP!

171
00:10:21,041 --> 00:10:23,000
- GET YOUR BUTT OVER HERE!
- ( giggling )

172
00:10:23,083 --> 00:10:24,666
( squeals )

173
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:26,166
- OH!

174
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:30,166
DOES SHE LIKE HER
MORE THAN ME?

175
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:31,458
- LET'S GO, KOUMEI.

176
00:10:31,541 --> 00:10:33,833
- Ekitoku: YOU'RE NOT
GOING ANYWHERE!

177
00:10:36,625 --> 00:10:40,208
- I WANT TO KNOW.
I NEED TO KNOW.

178
00:10:40,291 --> 00:10:43,083
I NEED TO KNOW HOW GENTOKU
REALLY FEELS ABOUT ME.

179
00:10:43,166 --> 00:10:46,208
- Ekitoku: KAN'U?  HEY, KAN'U.

180
00:10:46,291 --> 00:10:48,583
YOU REALLY ARE ACTING STRANGE
TODAY, KAN'U.

181
00:10:48,666 --> 00:10:50,333
- NO, THAT'S NOT TRUE.

182
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:52,625
- IF YOU SAY SO.
WANT TO GET LUNCH?

183
00:10:52,708 --> 00:10:54,333
- SURE.
FOOD SOUNDS GOOD.

184
00:10:54,416 --> 00:10:56,750
- Koumei: FOR THOSE WHO DARE
TO PUT ON THAT NECKLACE,

185
00:10:56,833 --> 00:10:57,916
IT WILL BRING THEIR DEEPEST,

186
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,500
MOST HIDDEN DESIRES
TO THE SURFACE.

187
00:11:00,583 --> 00:11:03,458
THEN THEIR INNER-MOST FEELINGS
WILL POSSESS THEM.

188
00:11:03,541 --> 00:11:05,000
- WHAT'S WRONG?

189
00:11:05,083 --> 00:11:07,208
- I'M NOT SURE IT'S SUCH
A GOOD IDEA TO LEAVE THE

190
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:09,958
HEART-REVEALING-STONE
NECKLACES HERE UNATTENDED.

191
00:11:10,041 --> 00:11:13,125
- YOU GOT THAT RIGHT.
THOSE THINGS ARE TROUBLE.

192
00:11:13,208 --> 00:11:15,500
IMAGINE WHAT COULD HAPPEN
IF THE WRONG PERSON PUT ONE ON.

193
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:16,625
- ( snoring )
- KOUCHUU, WAKE UP!

194
00:11:16,708 --> 00:11:17,708
- YES, MA'AM.

195
00:11:17,791 --> 00:11:19,583
- DON'T LET ANYONE NEAR
THOSE NECKLACES.

196
00:11:19,666 --> 00:11:21,875
WE'RE GOING TO GRAB LUNCH.
- NO, WAIT.

197
00:11:21,958 --> 00:11:23,791
- I'LL STAY AND GUARD
THE NECKLACES.

198
00:11:23,875 --> 00:11:26,125
- REALLY?
SUIT YOURSELF.

199
00:11:29,916 --> 00:11:31,750
- ( moans )
- HUH?

200
00:11:31,833 --> 00:11:33,500
WAKE UP, KOUMEI.

201
00:11:33,583 --> 00:11:38,041
YOU SHOULDN'T FALL ASLEEP HERE.
YOU COULD CATCH COLD THAT WAY.

202
00:11:38,125 --> 00:11:42,416
KOUMEI, I CAN'T MOVE MY ARM.
( giggles )

203
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:47,375
I GUESS WE COULD STAY
LIKE THIS A WHILE LONGER.

204
00:11:47,458 --> 00:11:51,041
YOU'RE SO CUTE, KOUMEI,
AND YOU SMELL SO SWEET,

205
00:11:51,125 --> 00:11:53,125
LIKE A NEWBORN BABY.

206
00:11:53,208 --> 00:11:55,791
- I WANT TO KNOW.

207
00:11:55,875 --> 00:11:58,958
I HAVE TO KNOW.
I CAN'T GO ON UNLESS I KNOW.

208
00:12:04,625 --> 00:12:05,791
- HMM.

209
00:12:05,875 --> 00:12:07,708
- I HAVE TO KNOW.

210
00:12:07,791 --> 00:12:10,666
I HAVE TO KNOW, I HAVE TO KNOW,
I HAVE TO KNOW NOW.

211
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:13,583
- OKAY! LET'S FIND OUT WHAT
YOU'RE GONNA TREAT ME TO!

212
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:15,875
- WHEN DID I SAY LUNCH
WOULD BE MY TREAT?

213
00:12:15,958 --> 00:12:17,458
- YOU OWE ME, MISTER.

214
00:12:17,541 --> 00:12:19,958
IT'S PAYBACK
FOR GROPING MY BOOBS EARLIER.

215
00:12:20,041 --> 00:12:21,791
- Hakufu: HEY, GUYS!

216
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:25,208
- NANYO ACADEMY?
WHAT ARE YOU GUYS DOING HERE?

217
00:12:25,291 --> 00:12:27,625
- ( humming )

218
00:12:33,625 --> 00:12:35,666
- GENTOKU RYUUBI BELONGS TO ME.

219
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:39,083
- OH.
YOU'RE AWAKE, KOUMEI?

220
00:12:39,166 --> 00:12:42,875
- GENTOKU'S BOOBS ARE SO BIG.

221
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:45,541
- EH? AH, MAYBE YOU'RE
NOT SO AWAKE AFTER ALL.

222
00:12:45,625 --> 00:12:47,958
- ( sighs )

223
00:12:48,041 --> 00:12:50,916
- OH!  KAN'U, THAT YOU?

224
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,750
- HOW'D YOU KNOW IT WAS ME?

225
00:12:52,833 --> 00:12:55,625
- I COULD SMELL YOU.
I'D KNOW THAT SCENT ANYWHERE.

226
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:56,833
- YOU SMELLED ME?

227
00:12:56,916 --> 00:13:00,791
SHE COULD SMELL ME, SMELL ME,
SMELL ME!

228
00:13:00,875 --> 00:13:03,666
- IS EVERYTHING OKAY?
- I BROUGHT THIS.

229
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:06,208
- IT'S A PRESENT
FOR YOU, GENTOKU.

230
00:13:06,291 --> 00:13:09,333
- FOR ME?
OH, KAN'U, THANK YOU SO MUCH.

231
00:13:09,416 --> 00:13:10,708
- ( swallows )

232
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:13,333
- AH... ( giggles )

233
00:13:13,416 --> 00:13:16,458
DON'T STARE AT ME LIKE THAT.
IT EMBARRASSES ME.

234
00:13:16,541 --> 00:13:17,625
- OH.  I'M SORRY.

235
00:13:17,708 --> 00:13:20,125
- THIS NECKLACE IS SO SPARKLY.

236
00:13:20,208 --> 00:13:22,500
IT'S REALLY PRETTY.
I LOVE IT.

237
00:13:22,583 --> 00:13:25,208
- YEAH YEAH, THAT'S GREAT.
NOW HURRY UP AND PUT IT ON.

238
00:13:25,291 --> 00:13:27,333
- HUH?

239
00:13:27,416 --> 00:13:28,625
OH, OKAY.

240
00:13:34,916 --> 00:13:38,625
- HOW DO YOU FEEL?
- I'M FINE.  HOW ARE YOU?

241
00:13:38,708 --> 00:13:40,375
- WAIT.
YOU'RE SURE YOU FEEL FINE?

242
00:13:40,458 --> 00:13:42,041
YOU'RE NOT FEELING A HOT BURNING

243
00:13:42,125 --> 00:13:43,541
DESIRE RISING IN YOUR LOINS?

244
00:13:43,625 --> 00:13:46,375
- HMM. WELL, I DO
SUDDENLY HAVE A STRONG

245
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:48,125
BURNING DESIRE TO READ.

246
00:13:48,208 --> 00:13:50,375
- THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEANT.
COME ON. IS THERE SOMETHING

247
00:13:50,458 --> 00:13:52,666
YOU WANT TO SAY TO ME NOW
THAT YOU HAVEN'T BEFORE?

248
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:56,583
- WELL, SOMETIMES I THINK
YOU CAN BE A BIT OVERBEARING.

249
00:13:56,666 --> 00:13:58,666
- ( sighs )

250
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:00,583
SO I GUESS I HAVE MY ANSWER.

251
00:14:00,666 --> 00:14:03,125
DEEP DOWN IN YOUR HEART
YOU DON'T REALLY LIKE ME.

252
00:14:03,208 --> 00:14:06,375
- THAT'S RIDICULOUS.
I DO LIKE YOU.

253
00:14:06,458 --> 00:14:08,000
- WHAT?
DID YOU MEAN THAT?

254
00:14:08,083 --> 00:14:10,166
SAY IT ONCE AGAIN FOR ME,
PLEASE.

255
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:13,083
- OKAY, KAN'U--
I LIKE YOU.

256
00:14:13,166 --> 00:14:17,041
I LIKE YOU, I LIKE YOU,
I LIKE LIKE LIKE LIKE YOU!

257
00:14:17,125 --> 00:14:22,041
- ( bells tolling )
- CARO MIO!

258
00:14:22,125 --> 00:14:24,958
- AND I LIKE KOUMEI TOO.

259
00:14:25,041 --> 00:14:28,583
AND I LIKE EKITOKU
AND I LIKE SHIRYU TOO.

260
00:14:28,666 --> 00:14:31,541
I JUST LIKE EVERYONE.
HUH?  ARE YOU OKAY?

261
00:14:31,625 --> 00:14:34,208
WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU?
I KNOW.

262
00:14:34,291 --> 00:14:36,375
WHY DON'T YOU WEAR THE NECKLACE
FOR A WHILE, KAN'U?

263
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:38,083
IT'LL DEFINITELY
LOOK GOOD ON YOU.

264
00:14:38,166 --> 00:14:40,250
- OH. STOP! DON'T, THAT'S--

265
00:14:40,333 --> 00:14:41,583
- HUH?

266
00:14:44,666 --> 00:14:46,541
- GENTOKU.

267
00:14:46,625 --> 00:14:49,041
- UH, KAN'U?

268
00:14:49,125 --> 00:14:50,875
- GENTOKU.

269
00:14:50,958 --> 00:14:53,750
- HEY!
LOOK, GUYS, WE'VE GOT GUESTS!

270
00:14:53,833 --> 00:14:57,416
- HI.
- OH, MISS SONSAKU.

271
00:15:00,291 --> 00:15:03,708
- Kan'u: HAKUFU SONSAKU.

272
00:15:05,375 --> 00:15:07,916
DON'T INTERFERE AGAIN!

273
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,041
- KAN'U!
IF YOU'RE HERE,

274
00:15:10,125 --> 00:15:13,416
THEN WHO'S GUARDING THE
NECKLACES? THE OLD MAN BACK?

275
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:16,041
( gasps ) THAT NECKLACE!
YOU'VE GOT IT ON.

276
00:15:16,125 --> 00:15:18,458
IS IT AFFECTING YOU?
- ( grunts )

277
00:15:18,541 --> 00:15:21,083
- OH!  KAN'U,
WHERE ARE YOU TAKING ME?!

278
00:15:21,166 --> 00:15:24,041
- THIS IS BAD.
- WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON?

279
00:15:24,125 --> 00:15:26,208
- Chou'un:
DID SOMETHING HAPPEN?

280
00:15:26,291 --> 00:15:28,541
I HEARD OUR LEADER SCREAMING.

281
00:15:28,625 --> 00:15:31,250
- Ekitoku: BECAUSE OF KAN'U.
SHE GRABBED RYUUBI AND RAN.

282
00:15:31,333 --> 00:15:32,666
IT'S BECAUSE OF THAT
HEART-REVEALING-STONE

283
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:34,625
NECKLACE SHE'S GOT ON.

284
00:15:34,708 --> 00:15:36,708
THAT'S JUST LIKE THE ONE
YOU'VE GOT ON.

285
00:15:36,791 --> 00:15:38,750
WAIT! CHOU'UN!
- SHI-SAN!

286
00:15:38,833 --> 00:15:41,666
- AH.
- Koumei: HER TRUE NATURE.

287
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:44,250
CHOU'UN.
THAT'S WHO SHE REALLY IS.

288
00:15:49,791 --> 00:15:53,375
- OH!

289
00:15:53,458 --> 00:15:57,833
THAT HURT.
WHAT'S HAPPENED TO YOU, KAN'U?

290
00:15:57,916 --> 00:15:59,916
( crying )

291
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,500
DO YOU WANT ME
TO CHANGE CLOTHES?

292
00:16:01,583 --> 00:16:04,458
- REMEMBER THE TWO OF US MADE
THE OATH OF THE PEACH GARDEN?

293
00:16:04,541 --> 00:16:06,708
WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW
IS DESTINY!

294
00:16:06,791 --> 00:16:10,291
- BUT KAN'U, WE'RE NOT SCHEDULED
FOR TRAINING RIGHT NOW.

295
00:16:10,375 --> 00:16:13,833
- I'M GOING TO BREAK YOU IN.
NOW DON'T STRUGGLE.

296
00:16:13,916 --> 00:16:15,166
- KAN'U?

297
00:16:18,333 --> 00:16:20,291
SHIRYU!

298
00:16:24,666 --> 00:16:27,333
OH, HELLO THERE.

299
00:16:27,416 --> 00:16:30,333
ARE YOU AND KAN'U BOTH
GOING TO TRAIN ME TOGETHER?

300
00:16:30,416 --> 00:16:33,291
I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN HANDLE
YOU BOTH AT ONCE.

301
00:16:33,375 --> 00:16:37,291
- WOW! THAT NECKLACE HAS SUCH
STRANGE AND MYSTERIOUS POWERS.

302
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:39,791
- THIS IS NO TIME FOR LESSONS
IN MYSTICISM.

303
00:16:39,875 --> 00:16:41,333
IF THOSE TWO
REALLY GET INTO IT,

304
00:16:41,416 --> 00:16:43,833
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE
A MAJOR PROBLEM ON OUR HANDS.

305
00:16:43,916 --> 00:16:46,250
- INDEED, ONE OF THEM
WILL SURELY DIE.

306
00:16:46,333 --> 00:16:47,541
- ( all gasp )

307
00:16:47,625 --> 00:16:49,583
- Ekitoku: KOUMEI,
DON'T SAY THINGS LIKE THAT!

308
00:16:49,666 --> 00:16:52,583
THIS ISN'T FUNNY.
NOW, COME ON.  LET'S HURRY.

309
00:17:07,041 --> 00:17:10,708
- KAN'U, I DON'T NORMALLY
MIND TRAINING WITH YOU,

310
00:17:10,791 --> 00:17:13,041
BUT THIS SEEMS STRANGE.
- BE QUIET.

311
00:17:13,125 --> 00:17:14,916
- THERE IS NO FORGIVENESS.

312
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,125
YOU HAVE DISRESPECTED
OUR LEADER AND MUST PAY.

313
00:17:17,208 --> 00:17:19,791
- Ryuubi: DISRESPECTED?
- GENTOKU IS MINE.

314
00:17:19,875 --> 00:17:23,041
IF YOU DO ANYTHING TO TRY
TO DRIVE A WEDGE BETWEEN US,

315
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:24,708
I SWEAR I WILL KILL YOU!

316
00:17:24,791 --> 00:17:27,458
- KAN'U,
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

317
00:17:27,541 --> 00:17:29,666
HUH?

318
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:32,083
- I TOLD YOU NOW
TO BE QUIET.

319
00:17:32,166 --> 00:17:33,541
- KAN'U!

320
00:17:33,625 --> 00:17:35,458
- ( both gasping )

321
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:43,958
- WE'RE TOO LATE!

322
00:17:44,041 --> 00:17:45,708
- I'VE GOT TO TRY
TO STOP THOSE TWO.

323
00:17:45,791 --> 00:17:47,916
- DON'T BE STUPID.
- WHO YOU CALLIN' STUPID?

324
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:54,041
- WAIT.
BOTH OF YOU, STOP.

325
00:17:54,125 --> 00:17:55,333
WE'RE ALL ON THE SAME SIDE.

326
00:17:55,416 --> 00:18:05,375
THERE'S NO REASON FOR
YOU TWO TO BE FIGHTING.

327
00:18:05,458 --> 00:18:14,916
THERE'S NO REASON FOR
YOU TWO TO BE FIGHTING.

328
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,666
- AH!

329
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:24,958
- ( all gasping )

330
00:18:27,333 --> 00:18:29,583
- All: OH!

331
00:18:37,958 --> 00:18:40,458
- Ekitoku:
MASTER SUIKYOU, YOU'RE BACK!

332
00:18:40,541 --> 00:18:43,666
- AYE YAI YAI.
LOOK AT THIS MESS.

333
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:46,958
WELL, I'M NOT CLEANING IT UP.
- WHERE AM I?

334
00:18:47,041 --> 00:18:49,458
- WHAT WAS I DOING?

335
00:18:49,541 --> 00:18:51,291
- AH.
- GENTOKU?

336
00:18:51,375 --> 00:18:52,666
- DON'T COME NEAR ME.

337
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:55,458
YOU'RE-- YOU'RE SCARY, KAN'U.

338
00:18:55,541 --> 00:18:59,416
- AH!  DID I DO ALL THIS?

339
00:19:04,083 --> 00:19:06,416
HOW COULD I?

340
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:10,458
I CANNOT BELIEVE I WAS SO
DISRESPECTFUL TO MY LEADER.

341
00:19:10,541 --> 00:19:13,541
THERE IS BUT ONE REMEDY.

342
00:19:17,625 --> 00:19:19,708
- NOW YOU LISTEN TO ME.

343
00:19:19,791 --> 00:19:22,166
I DON'T CARE
IF YOU DISRESPECTED ME.

344
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:25,166
I WON'T ALLOW YOU
TO TAKE YOUR OWN LIFE.

345
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:29,291
- AS SUN TZU TEACHES, "REGARD
YOUR SOLDIERS AS YOUR CHILDREN,

346
00:19:29,375 --> 00:19:32,000
AND THEY WILL FOLLOW YOU
INTO THE DEEPEST VALLEYS."

347
00:19:32,083 --> 00:19:33,708
- WHAT?

348
00:19:33,791 --> 00:19:35,125
- TO A LEADER,

349
00:19:35,208 --> 00:19:37,166
HIS SOLDIERS ARE LIKE HIS
FLESH-AND-BLOOD CHILDREN.

350
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:39,583
THAT'S WHY HIS SOLDIERS
ARE DEVOTED TO HIM

351
00:19:39,666 --> 00:19:42,333
AND WILL FOLLOW HIM TO THE
ENDS OF THE EARTH AND BEYOND.

352
00:19:42,416 --> 00:19:44,541
THAT'S WHAT IT MEANS, RIGHT?
- YES.

353
00:19:44,625 --> 00:19:47,875
- PLEASE LISTEN, KAN'U.
IF YOU WERE TO DIE,

354
00:19:47,958 --> 00:19:50,041
NO ONE WOULD BE SADDER
ABOUT IT THAN ME.

355
00:19:50,125 --> 00:19:51,375
- GENTOKU.

356
00:19:51,458 --> 00:19:53,666
- AS YOUR LEADER, I CARE
ABOUT YOU AS WELL, SHIRYU.

357
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:56,208
AND I WON'T TOLERATE YOU
TWO FIGHTING.

358
00:19:56,291 --> 00:19:58,250
NOW SOMEONE TELL ME
WHO STARTED IT.

359
00:19:58,333 --> 00:20:00,708
- IT'S MY FAULT.
- WHAT DID YOU DO?

360
00:20:00,791 --> 00:20:03,166
- ACTUALLY,
IT'S BECAUSE OF THIS.

361
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:06,250
APPARENTLY,
WHEN YOU PUT ON THIS NECKLACE,

362
00:20:06,333 --> 00:20:08,958
YOU JUST FEEL LIKE FIGHTING
EVERYONE FOR NO REASON.

363
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:12,375
- HAKUFU SONSAKU, THAT IS--
- RIGHT?

364
00:20:12,458 --> 00:20:14,250
- OH! THAT'S RIGHT.

365
00:20:14,333 --> 00:20:16,375
IT'S GOT ALL THESE WEIRD
MAGICAL POWERS AND STUFF.

366
00:20:16,458 --> 00:20:18,166
- MAGICAL POWERS?

367
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:21,208
BUT THEN HOW COME NOTHING
HAPPENED TO ME WHEN I PUT IT ON?

368
00:20:21,291 --> 00:20:22,458
- ( sighs )

369
00:20:22,541 --> 00:20:25,166
- OH, I FORGOT. WHAT
ARE YOU DOING HERE?

370
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:29,041
- WE CAME TO HAVE LUNCH AND MAKE
PEACE BETWEEN OUR SCHOOLS.

371
00:20:29,125 --> 00:20:30,625
- I THOUGHT WE DISCUSSED THIS.

372
00:20:30,708 --> 00:20:32,958
DIDN'T WE AGREE TO HAVE THE
LUNCHEON A WEEK FROM TODAY?

373
00:20:33,041 --> 00:20:35,166
- All: WHAT?!
- AH, IS THAT RIGHT?

374
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:38,416
WELL, THIS SORT OF THING
IS BETTER EARLY THAN LATE.

375
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:41,000
LET'S ALL CELEBRATE,
TO NEW FRIENDS!

376
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:47,666
( evil laughter )
- Koukin: HAKUFU!

377
00:20:52,166 --> 00:20:55,458
- UMM, RYOMOU?

378
00:20:55,541 --> 00:20:57,375
I'M SORRY.

379
00:20:57,458 --> 00:21:00,791
YOU WASTED YOUR WHOLE DAY
HERE AT THE CLINIC WITH ME.

380
00:21:00,875 --> 00:21:03,291
I FEEL BAD
TAKING UP ALL OF YOUR TIME.

381
00:21:03,375 --> 00:21:05,416
- THERE'S NO NEED
TO WORRY ABOUT THAT.

382
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:07,666
EVEN IF WE DIDN'T
FIND ANYTHING NEW TODAY,

383
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:09,541
WE HAVE TO KEEP TRYING.

384
00:21:09,625 --> 00:21:11,416
YOU CAN'T LIVE YOUR WHOLE LIFE
WITHOUT YOUR MEMORIES.

385
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:14,166
- THANKS FOR YOUR HELP,
RYOMOU.

386
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:18,750
- BUT ONCE SHE GETS
HER MEMORIES BACK,

387
00:21:18,833 --> 00:21:22,083
IS SHE GOING TO BECOME
THE OLD HOUSEN RYOFU?

388
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:25,250
- ( door opens )

389
00:21:25,333 --> 00:21:27,375
- Ryomou: WANT TO EAT
BEFORE WE HEAD BACK?

390
00:21:27,458 --> 00:21:30,083
- Saji: MIGHT I OFFER TO TREAT
YOU TWO LADIES?

391
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:35,416
BEEN A WHILE,
MOU-CHAN.

392
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:39,375
HMM.
- SAJI.

393
00:21:47,708 --> 00:21:51,625
- ( end theme playing )

394
00:21:53,291 --> 00:21:55,666
- ( singing in Japanese )

395
00:23:18,166 --> 00:23:20,875
-I KNOW I BARGED IN ON YOU
ALL RATHER SUDDENLY, BIG SISTER.

396
00:23:20,958 --> 00:23:22,625
I HOPE I HAVEN'T
BEEN A NUISANCE.

397
00:23:22,708 --> 00:23:23,791
- Hakufu: OF COURSE NOT.

398
00:23:23,875 --> 00:23:26,541
EVER SINCE YOU CAME,
EVERY DAY IS FUN.

399
00:23:26,625 --> 00:23:28,416
I'M SO HAPPY
WHENEVER CHUUBO IS AROUND.

400
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:31,125
I JUST HOPE YOU'RE NOT
GETTING TIRED OR BORED OF US.

401
00:23:31,208 --> 00:23:34,125
HMM.  HOW DO I KNOW
WHAT YOUR TRUE FEELINGS ARE?

402
00:23:34,208 --> 00:23:35,916
I KNOW.
I'LL USE THIS NECKLACE!

403
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,875
- Ryuubi: NO, MISS SONSAKU,
YOU MUSTN'T.

404
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:39,541
OH, NO.
IT'S ALREADY ON HER!

405
00:23:39,625 --> 00:23:41,375
MISS SONKEN?
MISS SONKEN!

406
00:23:41,458 --> 00:23:42,583
- Hakufu: WHOA, CHUUBO,

407
00:23:42,666 --> 00:23:47,000
IS THIS THE KIND OF
GIRL YOU REALLY ARE?
