1
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:35,916
- HMM?

2
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:42,916
A RABBIT!
- WHO SAID YOU COULD LOOK?

3
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
- YAY!

4
00:00:45,083 --> 00:00:48,416
- PINO, I WANTED
TO SHOW THAT TO MY MOM.

5
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:52,083
- A RABBIT?
- HE'S NOT JUST A NORMAL RABBIT.

6
00:00:52,166 --> 00:00:54,833
HE'S LIKE A SUPER RABBIT,
BUT NOBODY KNOWS

7
00:00:54,916 --> 00:00:58,250
WHERE HE IS ANYMORE,
BUT HE'S SOMEWHERE OUT THERE.

8
00:00:58,333 --> 00:01:01,958
AND WHEN WE FIND HIM,
WE CAN GO ANYWHERE.

9
00:01:06,041 --> 00:01:06,958
- Both: FINISHED!

10
00:01:07,041 --> 00:01:09,750
- HUH?  HUH!

11
00:01:10,916 --> 00:01:12,916
- THEY MATCH.

12
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,666
- YOU'RE INCREDIBLE.
- ( laughs )

13
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:18,583
- ( wind howling )

14
00:01:32,458 --> 00:01:35,625
- ( rock music playing )

29
00:03:51,041 --> 00:03:52,750
- THAT'S THE END OF THIS PLACE.

30
00:03:52,833 --> 00:03:55,958
- Boy: OVER HERE.

31
00:03:56,041 --> 00:03:57,958
MOM!

32
00:03:58,041 --> 00:04:01,416
- TIMOTHY,
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN HIDING?

33
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,250
COME ON, LET'S GO.

34
00:04:05,333 --> 00:04:08,458
- LOT OF PATROLS LATELY, HUH?

35
00:04:08,541 --> 00:04:11,958
- YEAH, EVER SINCE A CERTAIN
SOMEONE ARRIVED.

36
00:04:12,041 --> 00:04:15,958
- I WONDER WHY THAT IS.
- WHY DON'T YOU GO AWAY?

37
00:04:17,875 --> 00:04:21,166
- COME TO THINK ABOUT IT,
WHY DID YOU COME HERE AT ALL?

38
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:23,500
- BECAUSE I--

39
00:04:23,583 --> 00:04:26,708
- BECAUSE VINCENT
IS THE CHOSEN ONE, OF COURSE.

40
00:04:29,375 --> 00:04:31,208
- ( grunts )

41
00:04:31,291 --> 00:04:33,750
- THIS MAN IS WELL-KNOWN
AS A REVOLUTIONARY

42
00:04:33,833 --> 00:04:35,333
THROUGHOUT ROMDEAU.

43
00:04:35,416 --> 00:04:37,291
A FAMED WARRIOR
OF THE RESISTANCE,

44
00:04:37,375 --> 00:04:40,041
VINCENT IS RESPONSIBLE
FOR DIRECTING MANY ACTIONS

45
00:04:40,125 --> 00:04:42,333
AGAINST THE DOME'S ESTABLISHED
RULING PARTY.

46
00:04:42,416 --> 00:04:44,833
- HEY, HOODY, COME ON.  JUST
HOLD ON A SECOND, ALL RIGHT?

47
00:04:44,916 --> 00:04:47,125
- WE WITNESSED HIS
MAGNIFICENT GUNPLAY.

48
00:04:47,208 --> 00:04:50,125
THEY CAN SEND AS MANY
PATROL FLIGHTS THEY'D LIKE

49
00:04:50,208 --> 00:04:51,750
AGAINST OUR COMMUNE.

50
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:54,458
HE'LL DISPATCH THEM 
AS IF IT WERE CHILD'S PLAY.

51
00:04:54,541 --> 00:04:57,333
- ( murmuring )

52
00:04:57,416 --> 00:05:00,666
- THE OF FALL OF ROMDEAU
IS ALMOST AT HAND.

53
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:04,375
CITIZENS TURNED REFUGEE ARE
JOINING THE COMMUNE EN MASSE.

54
00:05:04,458 --> 00:05:07,500
THESE ATTACKS AGAINST US
ARE THE LAST DESPERATE ACTS

55
00:05:07,583 --> 00:05:08,875
OF THE CITY GOVERNMENT.

56
00:05:08,958 --> 00:05:11,208
THEY STRUGGLE
TO KEEP THE CITIZENRY

57
00:05:11,291 --> 00:05:13,375
FROM ABANDONING THEM.

58
00:05:13,458 --> 00:05:15,375
( sighs )

59
00:05:15,458 --> 00:05:18,083
BUT THEIR VIOLENCE ONLY
URGES REVOLUTIONARIES

60
00:05:18,166 --> 00:05:20,250
SUCH AS VINCENT
TO RETALIATE.

61
00:05:20,333 --> 00:05:22,208
QUITE FOOLISH REALLY.

62
00:05:22,291 --> 00:05:23,875
- THANKS A LOT, HOODY.

63
00:05:23,958 --> 00:05:27,125
- REVOLUTIONARY?
( scoffs )

64
00:05:27,208 --> 00:05:29,416
I COULD CARE LESS
ABOUT REVOLUTION

65
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:32,500
OR THE FUTURE OF ROMDEAU.
I WANT NO PART OF THIS.

66
00:05:32,583 --> 00:05:34,541
- WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

67
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:37,041
OUR FREEDOM HANGS ON THE SUCCESS
OF THIS REVOLUTION.

68
00:05:37,125 --> 00:05:39,708
- WHAT THE HELL IS THE POINT
OF FREEDOM IF YOU HAVE TO DIE

69
00:05:39,791 --> 00:05:42,500
TO GET IT?
- ( murmuring )

70
00:05:42,583 --> 00:05:46,083
I GIVE YOU MY WORD THAT
NO MORE LIVES WILL BE LOST.

71
00:05:46,166 --> 00:05:47,791
- HOW CAN YOU
MAKE THAT PROMISE?

72
00:05:49,666 --> 00:05:52,208
- WELL, BECAUSE--

73
00:05:52,291 --> 00:05:55,916
BECAUSE AN INSIDE SOURCE
HAS BEEN GIVING ME NOTICE

74
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,375
AS TO WHEN THE PATROL FIGHTERS
ARE GOING TO ATTACK.

75
00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:00,208
- THAT'S HOW.
- ( murmuring )

76
00:06:00,291 --> 00:06:02,958
- ( clears throat )
FINE.

77
00:06:03,041 --> 00:06:05,041
I WAS HOPING TO KEEP IT A SECRET
TO AVOID A PANIC,

78
00:06:05,125 --> 00:06:07,541
BUT I SUPPOSE I MUST TELL YOU
THAT I'VE BEEN IN NEGOTIATIONS

79
00:06:07,625 --> 00:06:10,916
FOR OUR AUTONOMY
WITH ROMDEAU FOR SOME TIME NOW.

80
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,916
OUR ENEMY IS ANXIOUS
TO SETTLE THIS.

81
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,416
THEY PRACTICALLY CAME HERE

82
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,041
CRAWLING ON THEIR
HANDS AND KNEES

83
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:19,250
ASKING FOR OUR RETURN.
- I'LL BE DAMNED.

84
00:06:19,333 --> 00:06:22,416
- IT'S A DREAM COME TRUE.
- ( laughing )

85
00:06:27,333 --> 00:06:30,625
- THAT WAS A VERY CLOSE CALL.

86
00:06:30,708 --> 00:06:34,000
IF I HADN'T HELPED YOU OUT OF
YOUR LITTLE SITUATION BACK THERE

87
00:06:34,083 --> 00:06:36,458
YOU'D HAVE QUITE A MOB
ON YOUR HANDS RIGHT NOW.

88
00:06:36,541 --> 00:06:39,333
- BUT STILL,
YOU REALLY DIDN'T HAVE TO LIE.

89
00:06:39,416 --> 00:06:42,000
- I'D PREFER TO THINK OF IT
AS WORKING A CLOSE CALL.

90
00:06:42,083 --> 00:06:44,833
AND IT WAS A CLOSE CALL,

91
00:06:44,916 --> 00:06:46,875
A VERY CLOSE CALL.

92
00:06:52,375 --> 00:06:55,333
- JUST LEAVE THINGS TO HOODY
AND IT'LL ALL WORK OUT

93
00:06:55,416 --> 00:06:57,708
FOR THE BEST.
- MM-HMM.

94
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:59,708
- YEAH, QUINN,

95
00:06:59,791 --> 00:07:01,958
YOU GOT SOMETHING YOU WANNA SAY?

96
00:07:02,041 --> 00:07:04,791
- NOT REALLY.  I WAS
JUST WONDERING HOW EXACTLY

97
00:07:04,875 --> 00:07:07,833
HOODY MANAGED TO GET IN TOUCH
WITH ANYONE FROM ROMDEAU.

98
00:07:07,916 --> 00:07:11,708
JUST SEEMS STRANGE TO ME.
- ( gasping )

99
00:07:23,416 --> 00:07:25,750
- YES, THIS IS THE COMMUNE.

100
00:07:25,833 --> 00:07:29,375
ATTEMPTING COMMUNICATION
WITH ROMDEAU.  OVER.

101
00:07:29,458 --> 00:07:31,208
CAN I HELP YOU?

102
00:07:31,291 --> 00:07:33,625
- QUINN WAS WONDERING--

103
00:07:33,708 --> 00:07:37,208
- WHAT WAS THAT?
VERY WELL.

104
00:07:39,166 --> 00:07:41,666
IT SEEMS THAT THEY'RE READY
TO ADMIT THAT

105
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:43,916
THEIR BACK'S AGAINST THE WALL.

106
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,166
I THINK THEY'RE FINALLY READY
TO SEE THINGS OUR WAY.

107
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:50,583
THEY SOUND DESPERATE.

108
00:07:50,666 --> 00:07:53,041
- IS SOMEONE FROM ROMDEAU
COMING HERE?

109
00:07:53,125 --> 00:07:54,708
- LIKE WHO?  A NEGOTIATOR?

110
00:07:54,791 --> 00:07:57,375
- A NEGOTIATOR.

111
00:07:57,458 --> 00:07:59,375
- MAYBE THEY'RE FINALLY
COMING FOR US.

112
00:07:59,458 --> 00:08:03,041
- WELL, I DON'T SUPPOSE

113
00:08:03,125 --> 00:08:04,083
THAT'S COMPLETELY OUT
OF THE QUESTION--

114
00:08:04,166 --> 00:08:06,125
- WE CAN GO BACK TO ROMDEAU?!

115
00:08:06,208 --> 00:08:08,083
- WHAT GOOD LUCK.
- HOT DAMN!

116
00:08:10,166 --> 00:08:12,875
- SO, HOODY,
IS THAT THE RADIO?

117
00:08:12,958 --> 00:08:15,291
- HUH?  OH!

118
00:08:15,375 --> 00:08:17,333
- ( all laughing )

119
00:08:22,166 --> 00:08:23,958
- ALL THAT WORRY
FOR NOTHING.

120
00:08:24,041 --> 00:08:25,708
- I TRIED TO TELL YOU.

121
00:08:25,791 --> 00:08:30,083
WITH A GREAT REVOLUTIONARY
ON OUR SIDE, WE'RE INVINCIBLE.

122
00:08:30,166 --> 00:08:34,291
- SPEAKING OF WHICH,
WHERE DID HE GET TO?

123
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,083
- FOUND YOU!
YOU'RE PLAYING HIDE AND SEEK?

124
00:08:45,166 --> 00:08:48,250
ME TOO. ( laughs )

125
00:08:48,333 --> 00:08:51,416
- SHH!
JUST GO PLAY SOMEWHERE ELSE.

126
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,750
- OH.  ROGER!

127
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:57,250
HIDE AND SEEK!  HIDE AND SEEK!
- SHH!  SHH!

128
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:03,916
- DOESN'T LOOK LIKE
HE'S AROUND HERE.

129
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,125
- YEAH.

130
00:09:06,208 --> 00:09:09,625
- UGH!  SHH!

131
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:22,291
- FINISHED.
- ME TOO.

132
00:09:22,375 --> 00:09:23,625
- HUH?

133
00:09:23,708 --> 00:09:26,833
QUIT COPYING ME.
- ( laughs )

134
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:34,166
- WHY THE LONG FACE?

135
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:36,958
DON'T TELL ME OUR REVOLUTIONARY
HAS LOST HIS STOMACH.

136
00:09:37,041 --> 00:09:40,666
- SORRY,
BUT YOU STARTED THIS.

137
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:43,833
- SO YOU'RE COMPLAINING
NOW, TOO?

138
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:45,500
THEY'RE ALL TOTALLY
DEPENDENT ON ME,

139
00:09:45,583 --> 00:09:47,750
BUT THE SECOND THERE'S TIME
TO COMPLAIN.

140
00:09:47,833 --> 00:09:52,250
( sighs ) I'M THE ONLY ONE
RUNNING THE COMMUNE.

141
00:09:52,333 --> 00:09:53,708
WELL, DON'T WORRY.

142
00:09:53,791 --> 00:09:57,000
IF WE RIDE THIS ONE OUT,
EVENTUALLY WE'LL FIND PEACE.

143
00:09:57,083 --> 00:09:58,500
AND IF IT COMES TO IT,

144
00:09:58,583 --> 00:10:01,458
WE CAN ESCAPE
ON THE CENTZON TOTOCHTIN.

145
00:10:01,541 --> 00:10:05,000
- CENTZON?
- IT MEANS 400 RABBITS.

146
00:10:05,083 --> 00:10:07,500
- 400 RABBITS?

147
00:10:09,583 --> 00:10:11,500
- I FOUND THE RABBIT.

148
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:14,958
HEY!  WAIT!

149
00:10:23,083 --> 00:10:27,125
- WHAT DO YOU EXPECT?  NO ONE'S
EVEN SEEN IT EXCEPT FOR HOODY.

150
00:10:27,208 --> 00:10:30,041
I DON'T HAVE THE SLIGHTEST CLUE
WHAT KIND OF VEHICLE IT IS.

151
00:10:30,125 --> 00:10:32,750
GIVING IT THAT UTTERLY
RIDICULOUS NAME--

152
00:10:32,833 --> 00:10:36,541
"THE 400 RABBITS."
WHO KNOWS WHERE HE'S HIDING IT.

153
00:10:36,625 --> 00:10:37,958
- WHY WOULD HE HIDE IT?

154
00:10:38,041 --> 00:10:40,541
- HE MADE UP ONE OF HIS STORIES
ABOUT THE OUTSIDE WORLD

155
00:10:40,625 --> 00:10:44,208
BEING DANGEROUS.  REALLY
HE JUST WANTS TO KEEP US HERE.

156
00:10:44,291 --> 00:10:46,291
HE DOESN'T WANT
TO LOSE HIS COMPANIONS.

157
00:10:46,375 --> 00:10:48,541
THE WHOLE THING SCARES ME.

158
00:10:48,625 --> 00:10:51,541
LIES BEGAT LIES,
AND AT SOME POINT SOON,

159
00:10:51,625 --> 00:10:54,791
THERE WON'T BE ANY TURNING BACK.

160
00:10:54,875 --> 00:10:58,041
FOR BEING HUMAN,
SEEMS LIKE SUCH A TRAGIC STATE

161
00:10:58,125 --> 00:11:00,791
FOR EVERY ONE OF US.

162
00:11:03,416 --> 00:11:05,833
- SO WHEN'S
THE NEGOTIATOR COMING HERE?

163
00:11:05,916 --> 00:11:07,541
- I'M SURE HE'S ON HIS WAY.

164
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:08,833
- FROM WHERE?

165
00:11:08,916 --> 00:11:11,833
- I GUESS
FROM SOMEWHERE THAT WAY.

166
00:11:11,916 --> 00:11:13,333
- WELL, IF IT WERE ME,

167
00:11:13,416 --> 00:11:15,541
I THINK I'D CIRCLE
AROUND THE COMMUNE

168
00:11:15,625 --> 00:11:17,583
TO MAKE IT LOOK I WAS COMING

169
00:11:17,666 --> 00:11:20,333
FROM RIGHT OVER THERE.

170
00:11:20,416 --> 00:11:21,791
- ( all shout )

171
00:12:01,708 --> 00:12:03,916
- ( Pino and Timothy laughing )

172
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:07,666
- ( door opens )
- ( gasps )

173
00:12:19,958 --> 00:12:22,500
- HOODY, HE'S HERE.
HE'S FINALLY HERE.

174
00:12:22,583 --> 00:12:24,791
- WHO'S HERE?

175
00:12:24,875 --> 00:12:26,000
- THIS WAY.

176
00:12:32,708 --> 00:12:35,000
A NEGOTIATOR.

177
00:12:38,875 --> 00:12:40,208
- HUH?

178
00:12:41,541 --> 00:12:44,500
( gasps )

179
00:12:57,750 --> 00:13:01,541
- I CAN'T HEAR A THING.
I WONDER WHAT THEY'RE SAYING.

180
00:13:01,625 --> 00:13:03,833
- I CAN'T SEE
THE NEGOTIATOR'S FACE, EITHER.

181
00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:07,083
- I WONDER IF HOODY
CAN HANDLE THIS.

182
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:14,166
- ( clears throat )

183
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,291
YOU DON'T LOOK AT ALL LIKE
THE NEGOTIATOR FROM LAST TIME,

184
00:13:20,375 --> 00:13:24,250
BUT WHY DON'T YOU AT LEAST
START BY GIVING ME YOUR NAME?

185
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,708
THIS IS GOING NOWHERE.

186
00:13:28,791 --> 00:13:31,458
COULD YOU AT LEAST TELL ME
WHAT YOU'RE HERE FOR?

187
00:13:33,291 --> 00:13:36,375
ARE YOU TOO SCARED
TO CONTINUE NEGOTIATING?

188
00:13:36,458 --> 00:13:38,000
SO YOU PLAN TO ATTACK US?

189
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:41,500
IN THAT CASE,
YOU'LL BE DEALING WITH HIM.

190
00:13:41,583 --> 00:13:44,000
- UH, HELLO.

191
00:13:44,083 --> 00:13:47,875
- Re-l: VINCENT, IT'S ME.

192
00:13:47,958 --> 00:13:50,875
- RE-L.  WHAT ARE YOU--

193
00:13:50,958 --> 00:13:53,125
- I'VE COME TO RETRIEVE YOU.

194
00:13:53,208 --> 00:13:56,083
- WHAT?
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

195
00:13:56,166 --> 00:13:58,166
- YOU'RE COMING BACK
WITH ME TO ROMDEAU.

196
00:13:58,250 --> 00:14:02,166
- YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.
IT'S NOT ALL THAT EASY.

197
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:03,791
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

198
00:14:03,875 --> 00:14:05,166
ONCE SOMEONE'S LEFT ROMDEAU,

199
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:07,291
THEY'RE NOT SUPPOSED
TO BE ABLE TO RETURN.

200
00:14:07,375 --> 00:14:10,041
WHY?  WHY JUST HIM?

201
00:14:10,125 --> 00:14:13,625
- ( laughing )
- SHUT UP.

202
00:14:13,708 --> 00:14:17,500
GO AWAY!
- OKAY.

203
00:14:17,583 --> 00:14:19,583
- VINCENT, LET'S GO.

204
00:14:19,666 --> 00:14:22,583
- NO, YOU CAN'T HAVE HIM.

205
00:14:22,666 --> 00:14:24,583
- DO YOU WANT TO DIE?

206
00:14:24,666 --> 00:14:26,958
- ( growls )

207
00:14:27,041 --> 00:14:29,041
- Daedalus: RE-L, IT'S ME.
CAN YOU HEAR ME?

208
00:14:29,125 --> 00:14:33,166
- CHIEF, WE'VE RECEIVED A REPORT
FROM THE SECURITY--

209
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:35,083
- RE-L?

210
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:36,916
- WHAT?
- OUT OF THE WAY.

211
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,875
- Re-l: WHAT IS THIS PLACE?

212
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:41,125
THERE ARE PEOPLE ALL OVER HERE
ON THE OUTSIDE.

213
00:14:41,208 --> 00:14:44,083
- RE-L, I SPECIFICALLY TOLD YOU

214
00:14:44,166 --> 00:14:46,250
NOT TO MAKE CONTACT
WITH THE PEOPLE OUT THERE.

215
00:14:46,333 --> 00:14:48,291
- THEY WERE STANDING RIGHT IN
FRONT OF ME.

216
00:14:48,375 --> 00:14:51,250
KIND OF HARD TO MISS.  WHY WERE
YOU HIDING THIS FROM ME?

217
00:14:51,333 --> 00:14:53,375
- I JUST--

218
00:14:53,458 --> 00:14:55,666
I JUST DIDN'T WANT
TO WORRY YOU.

219
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:58,250
- THIS IS ABOUT MORE
THAN THE PROXY NOW.

220
00:14:58,333 --> 00:15:00,250
- PROXY?

221
00:15:00,333 --> 00:15:02,708
THIS IS ALL STARTING
TO SOUND VERY SUSPICIOUS.

222
00:15:02,791 --> 00:15:04,250
- DON'T TALK TO HIM!

223
00:15:04,333 --> 00:15:07,750
DAMN!

224
00:15:07,833 --> 00:15:10,958
- ALL RIGHT, WHAT DO YOU KNOW
ABOUT THE MONSTER?

225
00:15:11,041 --> 00:15:14,833
- YOU THINK PROXIES
ARE MONSTERS?

226
00:15:14,916 --> 00:15:17,125
YOU DON'T KNOW MUCH
ABOUT ANYTHING.

227
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:20,125
- HE'S LAUGHING.
- HE'S COLD AS ICE.

228
00:15:20,208 --> 00:15:22,541
PEOPLE HAVE CALLED THEM MONSTERS
OR DEMONS,

229
00:15:22,625 --> 00:15:24,625
BUT THAT'S ALL
NOTHING BUT NONSENSE.

230
00:15:24,708 --> 00:15:26,750
IN TRUTH,
PROXIES ARE MAGICIANS.

231
00:15:26,833 --> 00:15:29,208
THEY HAVE THE POWER TO
CHANGE THEIR APPEARANCE

232
00:15:29,291 --> 00:15:30,666
INTO ANY FORM THEY CHOOSE.

233
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:33,333
THEY CAN DISAPPEAR WITH EASE
LEAVING NO TRACE

234
00:15:33,416 --> 00:15:36,166
THEY WERE EVER THERE.

235
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:39,166
THEY CAN ALSO ENTER HUMAN BEINGS
AND TAKE CONTROL

236
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:40,541
OF THEIR MIND AND BODY.

237
00:15:42,166 --> 00:15:44,833
THEY CAN SUMMON LIGHTNING BOLTS

238
00:15:44,916 --> 00:15:47,333
AND SCORCH THE EARTH
WITH THEIR POWER.

239
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:52,666
THEY CAN EVEN CONJURE UP
FLAMING PLANETS FROM THE SKY!

240
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:53,833
- ( playing tune )

241
00:15:53,916 --> 00:15:56,833
- WOULD YOU KNOCK IT OFF?

242
00:16:01,458 --> 00:16:05,083
- BOTH OF YOU,
GO OUTSIDE AND STAY THERE.

243
00:16:07,583 --> 00:16:08,875
- TAG, YOU'RE IT.

244
00:16:12,625 --> 00:16:15,625
SORRY FOR THE INTERRUPTION.
I WAS ABOUT TO TELL YOU

245
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:17,750
THAT THERE IS MORE
THAN ONE PROXY.

246
00:16:17,833 --> 00:16:20,166
SIMPLY STEP INTO THE WILDERNESS
AND YOU'LL FIND THEM

247
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:21,541
CRAWLING ALL OVER THE PLACE.

248
00:16:21,625 --> 00:16:24,750
I MYSELF HAVE PERSONALLY
SEEN AT LEAST...

249
00:16:26,916 --> 00:16:28,125
- JUST FIVE?

250
00:16:28,208 --> 00:16:31,375
- WELL.

251
00:16:31,458 --> 00:16:34,875
- YOU'RE WASTING MY TIME.
COME ON, VINCENT.

252
00:16:34,958 --> 00:16:37,541
- WAIT.  VERY WELL.

253
00:16:37,625 --> 00:16:39,458
YOU LEAVE ME NO CHOICE.

254
00:16:39,541 --> 00:16:40,916
IF THIS IS THE WAY IT HAS
TO BE,

255
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,416
THEN I'LL TELL YOU
WHERE THE PROXY IS.

256
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:47,750
OF COURSE IN RETURN,
I'LL BE EXPECTING

257
00:16:47,833 --> 00:16:49,458
A LITTLE QUID PRO QUO...

258
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:51,958
- Daedalus: RE-L, IT'S ME AGAIN.
CAN YOU HEAR ME?

259
00:16:52,041 --> 00:16:53,750
- YES, WHAT?

260
00:16:53,833 --> 00:16:57,250
- FIRST, YOU RECOGNIZE
OUR RIGHT TO AUTONOMY...

261
00:16:57,333 --> 00:17:00,458
- THE SITUATION HAS CHANGED.
RETURN IMMEDIATELY.

262
00:17:00,541 --> 00:17:03,500
- THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT
I WAS PLANNING TO DO.

263
00:17:03,583 --> 00:17:07,416
- YOU SEEM STRANGELY WILLING.
HAVE YOU RETRIEVED VINCENT LAW?

264
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,208
- YES, I HAVE.

265
00:17:09,291 --> 00:17:12,250
- AND WE DEMAND THE RIGHT
TO RETURN TO ROMDEAU.

266
00:17:12,333 --> 00:17:15,875
YOU'RE TOO LOUD.
GO SOMEWHERE ELSE.

267
00:17:15,958 --> 00:17:17,083
- ( laughing )

268
00:17:17,166 --> 00:17:19,375
- BUT THAT'S WHERE WE'VE
SEEN PATROLS.

269
00:17:19,458 --> 00:17:22,083
- THEY WON'T FLY PATROLS
IN THE MIDDLE OF TALKS.

270
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:25,833
- I UNDERSTAND.  WE HAVE TO
GET OUT OF HERE, VINCENT.

271
00:17:28,833 --> 00:17:31,208
WE'RE RUNNING OUT OF TIME.

272
00:17:31,291 --> 00:17:34,833
THE SECURITY BUREAU IS PREPARING
TO STERILIZE THE COMMUNE.

273
00:17:34,916 --> 00:17:37,000
YOU'LL BE KILLED TOO,
IF YOU STAY HERE.

274
00:17:37,083 --> 00:17:41,041
- STERILIZE US?
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

275
00:17:41,125 --> 00:17:43,791
WE WERE JUST ABOUT
TO ESTABLISH FRIENDLY RELATIONS.

276
00:17:43,875 --> 00:17:46,791
- WE'RE LEAVING NOW, VINCENT.

277
00:17:46,875 --> 00:17:48,916
- ARE SOLDIERS REALLY
ON THEIR WAY?

278
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,416
WHAT ARE THEY
GOING TO DO TO US?

279
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:53,208
WHAT ABOUT ME?
WHAT SHOULD I DO?

280
00:17:53,291 --> 00:17:55,000
- LET GO!

281
00:17:55,083 --> 00:17:58,458
- YOU'RE JUST GOING TO
ABANDON US, AREN'T YOU?

282
00:17:58,541 --> 00:18:01,916
YOU'RE GOING TO ESCAPE
EVEN AFTER I SAVED YOU.

283
00:18:07,208 --> 00:18:10,833
- HEY, I SAID
STOP COPYING ME.

284
00:18:12,916 --> 00:18:16,166
JUST TRY DRAWING SOMETHING
YOU WANNA DRAW YOURSELF.

285
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:20,000
- WHAT DO I WANNA DRAW MYSELF?
- DON'T ASK ME.

286
00:18:20,083 --> 00:18:22,500
JUST DRAW WHATEVER POPS
INTO YOUR HEAD.

287
00:18:22,583 --> 00:18:24,833
LIKE SOMETHING YOU WANT
TO EAT RIGHT NOW.

288
00:18:24,916 --> 00:18:28,541
- BUT I DON'T EAT.
- OH, YEAH.

289
00:18:28,625 --> 00:18:31,541
THEN JUST CLOSE YOUR EYES.

290
00:18:31,625 --> 00:18:35,333
NOW REMEMBER SOMETHING
REALLY FUN.

291
00:18:36,958 --> 00:18:39,541
AND ONCE YOU REMEMBER SOMETHING,

292
00:18:39,625 --> 00:18:41,625
THEN YOU CAN TRY DRAWING IT.

293
00:18:48,958 --> 00:18:51,333
- SO I GUESS WE'RE
ALL GOING BACK.

294
00:18:51,416 --> 00:18:53,083
- I GOING TO NEED
TO PACK MY BAGS.

295
00:18:53,166 --> 00:18:57,000
- WHAT?  A PATROL FLIGHT?

296
00:18:57,083 --> 00:18:58,875
- I THOUGHT THEY
STOPPED COMING.

297
00:18:58,958 --> 00:19:00,250
- THEY'RE HERE TO HELP.

298
00:19:10,958 --> 00:19:12,916
- KEEP MOVING, VINCENT.

299
00:19:18,625 --> 00:19:20,208
- IT'S JUST--

300
00:19:20,291 --> 00:19:22,708
CAN'T WE BRING
THE OTHERS ALONG WITH US?

301
00:19:24,208 --> 00:19:26,500
IT'S JUST NOT RIGHT
THAT I GET TO GO BACK.

302
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:28,500
NOT WHEN--

303
00:19:28,583 --> 00:19:30,416
- ONCE YOU'RE BACK IN ROMDEAU,

304
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:33,041
YOU'LL FORGET ABOUT
THIS WHOLE EXPERIENCE.

305
00:19:33,125 --> 00:19:35,333
THE PEOPLE, THE COMMUNE,
EVERYTHING.

306
00:19:35,416 --> 00:19:37,458
YOU JUST NEED SOME TIME
TO GET BACK IN STEP

307
00:19:37,541 --> 00:19:38,833
WITH YOUR REAL LIFE.

308
00:19:38,916 --> 00:19:42,083
- BUT WHAT IF CAN'T GO BACK
TO HOW I WAS BEFORE?

309
00:19:42,166 --> 00:19:44,958
- DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
I PROMISE I'LL TESTIFY

310
00:19:45,041 --> 00:19:47,958
AS TO YOUR INNOCENCE.
- THAT'S NOT THE POINT.

311
00:19:50,166 --> 00:19:52,750
I KNOW...

312
00:19:52,833 --> 00:19:55,291
EVEN IF I GO BACK
TO ROMDEAU,

313
00:19:55,375 --> 00:19:57,750
NOW THAT I FOUND OUT THE TRUTH,

314
00:19:57,833 --> 00:19:59,916
NOW THAT I KNOW ABOUT
THE WORLD OUTSIDE,

315
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,416
I CAN NEVER BE

316
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:05,208
A FELLOW CITIZEN.

317
00:20:05,291 --> 00:20:08,291
- THERE'S NOWHERE ELSE
YOU CAN GO EXCEPT ROMDEAU.

318
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:11,708
WHERE WOULD YOU LIVE?
THIS GARBAGE DUMP?

319
00:20:11,791 --> 00:20:13,333
DON'T MAKE ME LAUGH.

320
00:20:13,416 --> 00:20:16,000
- I KNOW.  YOU'RE RIGHT.

321
00:20:16,083 --> 00:20:18,166
I MEAN, WHERE COULD I POSSIBLY
BELONG NOW?

322
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:20,125
NOT HERE OR ROMDEAU.

323
00:20:20,208 --> 00:20:23,750
SO I SUPPOSE I SHOULD JUST
RETURN TO WHERE I WAS BORN.

324
00:20:23,833 --> 00:20:28,416
- BACK TO THE LOST DOME?
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

325
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:31,125
- LOOK OUT!

326
00:20:41,875 --> 00:20:43,750
- STOP!

327
00:21:05,166 --> 00:21:06,666
- ( screams )

328
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:18,333
- ( shouting )

329
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:35,166
- COOL.

330
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:37,916
SHE CAN DO ANYTHING.

331
00:21:49,166 --> 00:21:51,083
- Pino: TIMOTHY!

332
00:21:55,083 --> 00:21:57,958
Daedalus:
RE-L?  RE-L?

333
00:21:59,291 --> 00:22:03,208
- DAEDALUS, THEY FRIED
MY ELECTRICAL SYSTEM.

334
00:22:03,291 --> 00:22:04,541
I CAN'T MOVE.

335
00:22:04,625 --> 00:22:07,416
- RE-L.
- DAMN IT.

336
00:22:10,291 --> 00:22:13,291
- STOP!  YOU'LL DIE IF YOU COME
IN CONTACT WITH THE ATMOSPHERE.

337
00:22:13,375 --> 00:22:16,958
- ( air hisses )
- RE-L, COME BACK!

338
00:22:28,833 --> 00:22:30,958
- WHO ARE YOU?

339
00:22:36,958 --> 00:22:39,583
( panting )

340
00:22:43,666 --> 00:22:45,875
I NEED TO CONTACT
ROMDEAU IMMEDIATELY.

341
00:22:45,958 --> 00:22:48,791
- IS THAT THE RADIO?
- ( stammers )

342
00:22:53,166 --> 00:22:56,750
- ( playing tune )

343
00:22:56,833 --> 00:22:58,291
- Hoody: NO, THE NOTE
SHOULD BE HIGHER--

344
00:22:58,375 --> 00:23:01,333
- WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?
WHAT'S GOING ON?

345
00:23:01,416 --> 00:23:03,208
- ( clears throat )

346
00:23:03,291 --> 00:23:08,000
- HAND OVER THE RADIO.
- QUINN, COME WITH ME.

347
00:23:08,083 --> 00:23:11,750
- WHAT'S THE MATTER?
- HURRY UP, HURRY!

348
00:23:11,833 --> 00:23:14,708
- IF I DON'T CONTACT
ROMDEAU SOON.

349
00:23:14,791 --> 00:23:16,000
- Hoody: SETTLE DOWN.

350
00:23:16,083 --> 00:23:18,750
HERE, HAVE SOMETHING TO DRINK--
- SHUT UP!

351
00:23:18,833 --> 00:23:21,166
( coughs )

352
00:23:28,541 --> 00:23:30,791
WHAT'S GOING ON?

353
00:23:30,875 --> 00:23:32,375
WHY WAS THERE A PROXY HERE?

354
00:23:32,458 --> 00:23:35,083
( gasps )

355
00:23:35,166 --> 00:23:38,625
TELL ME WHY DOES THE PROXY
ONLY APPEAR

356
00:23:38,708 --> 00:23:41,666
WHEN YOU'RE SOMEWHERE NEARBY?
ANSWER ME!

357
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:46,958
WHO THE HELL ARE YOU?

358
00:23:47,041 --> 00:23:49,208
WHO?

359
00:23:50,458 --> 00:23:53,708
- RE-L!
- ( groaning )

360
00:23:56,291 --> 00:23:59,791
- Pino: I TOLD YOU, TIMOTHY
WON'T GIVE ME MY BOOK BACK.

361
00:23:59,875 --> 00:24:03,208
- ALL RIGHT.
- HE WON'T ANSWER ME, EITHER.

362
00:24:09,458 --> 00:24:12,208
- ( gasps )

363
00:24:31,625 --> 00:24:35,000

364
00:24:50,333 --> 00:24:54,208

Re-l: A MAN STANDS IN
THE WAY OF OUR DEPARTURE.

372
00:26:05,041 --> 00:26:06,958
WHEN THE BALANCE OF POWER

373
00:26:07,041 --> 00:26:09,125
BETWEEN OPPOSING
FORCES COLLAPSES,

374
00:26:09,208 --> 00:26:13,125
THE DOOR OPENS ON
A PLACE TO WHICH WE MUST RETURN.
