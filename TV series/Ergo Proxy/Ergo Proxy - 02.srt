1
00:00:37,166 --> 00:00:39,583
- Man: THIRTY-FIVE.

2
00:00:39,666 --> 00:00:42,583
- ( machines beeping )

3
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:45,666
- THIRTY-SIX.

4
00:00:50,166 --> 00:00:51,750
THIRTY-SEVEN.

5
00:00:55,375 --> 00:00:57,333
THIRTY-EIGHT.

6
00:01:02,041 --> 00:01:03,416
THIRTY-NINE.

7
00:01:07,875 --> 00:01:09,833
FORTY.

8
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:15,208
FORTY-ONE.

9
00:01:20,875 --> 00:01:21,875
FORTY-TWO.

10
00:01:21,958 --> 00:01:23,041
- NOT HIM.

11
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:27,375
NOT HIM.

12
00:01:28,625 --> 00:01:30,625
NOT HIM.

13
00:01:30,708 --> 00:01:33,291
NOT HIM.

14
00:01:33,375 --> 00:01:35,375
NOT HIM.

15
00:01:35,458 --> 00:01:37,916
NOT HIM.

16
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,666
NOT HIM!

17
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:41,125
NOT HIM.

18
00:01:41,208 --> 00:01:44,958
NO!  NO!  NO!  NO!  NO!

19
00:01:45,041 --> 00:01:47,500
THEY'RE ALL WRONG!

20
00:01:47,583 --> 00:01:49,625
- THAT'S EVERYONE
WE HAVE ON RECORD.

21
00:01:49,708 --> 00:01:51,625
- IT'S SOMEONE YOU SAW
FOR A SPLIT SECOND

22
00:01:51,708 --> 00:01:53,500
RIGHT BEFORE YOU BLACKED OUT.

23
00:01:53,583 --> 00:01:56,041
MAYBE ONE MORE PASS,
BUT GO SLOWER.

24
00:01:56,125 --> 00:01:58,166
- VERY WELL.
FROM THE BEGINNING.

25
00:01:58,250 --> 00:01:59,541
- ARE YOU ALL IDIOTS?

26
00:01:59,625 --> 00:02:01,583
I TOLD YOU HE'S NOT
ON THE LIST.

27
00:02:01,666 --> 00:02:03,166
THE THING THAT ATTACKED ME.

28
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:05,791
- STILL INSISTING
ON THE MONSTER STORY.

29
00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:08,166
- WHY DON'T YOU EXAMINE
THE CRIME SCENE CLOSELY?

30
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:11,458
WE CAN GO RIGHT NOW
IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME.

31
00:02:13,458 --> 00:02:16,958
- WE EXAMINED IT.  WE WENT OVER
EVERY LAST BIT OF DATA RECORDED

32
00:02:17,041 --> 00:02:19,208
BY YOUR HOME SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM
AND BY YOUR ENTOURAGE

33
00:02:19,291 --> 00:02:21,458
TO SEE IF THERE WAS ANYTHING
TO SUPPORT YOUR STATEMENT

34
00:02:21,541 --> 00:02:23,166
AND FOUND NOTHING.

35
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:24,750
- IT'S A CONSPIRACY.

36
00:02:24,833 --> 00:02:28,208
THE SECURITY BUREAU MUST HAVE
ERASED DATA THEY DIDN'T LIKE.

37
00:02:28,291 --> 00:02:29,916
THE INTELLIGENCE BUREAU--

38
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,750
NO, THE ADMINISTRATIVE BUREAU
HAS BEEN BETRAYED!

39
00:02:32,833 --> 00:02:37,000
- VITAL SIGN REPORT.  HEART RATE
IS RISING TO STRESS LEVELS.

40
00:02:37,083 --> 00:02:38,583
- MIND YOUR OWN DAMN BUSINESS.

41
00:02:38,666 --> 00:02:42,375
- PLEASE UNDERSTAND
AND REMAIN CALM,

42
00:02:42,458 --> 00:02:45,125
SINCE YOU ARE THE REGENT'S
GRANDDAUGHTER.

43
00:02:45,208 --> 00:02:48,250
- DON'T PATRONIZE ME,
YOU BASTARD.

44
00:02:48,333 --> 00:02:51,250
BEING HIS GRANDDAUGHTER MAKES
YOU A SUITABLE TARGET

45
00:02:51,333 --> 00:02:54,208
BY IMMIGRANTS WHO LACK COMPLETE
CONTROL OF THEIR EMOTIONS.

46
00:02:54,291 --> 00:02:55,791
- FOR EXAMPLE,

47
00:02:55,875 --> 00:02:59,250
LAST NIGHT WE FOUND A MAN LYING
UNCONSCIOUS NEARBY YOUR HOME.

48
00:02:59,333 --> 00:03:02,791
THIS ONE.

49
00:03:02,875 --> 00:03:04,791
- What were you doing there?

50
00:03:04,875 --> 00:03:09,333
Explain your reasons again
following standard procedure.

51
00:03:09,416 --> 00:03:12,083
- Well, I was there
because I was told

52
00:03:12,166 --> 00:03:15,083
that someone reported
an infected AutoReiv there.

53
00:03:15,166 --> 00:03:18,375
- This report
was not confirmed.

54
00:03:18,458 --> 00:03:20,958
- But I'm not lying.

55
00:03:21,041 --> 00:03:24,125
If you take a look
at the facility's records.

56
00:03:24,208 --> 00:03:26,166
- Man: VINCENT LAW.
WE'VE BEEN TOLD THAT HE

57
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:29,166
SUPPOSEDLY HAS DEVELOPED
PERSONAL FEELINGS FOR YOU.

58
00:03:30,958 --> 00:03:33,708
PERHAPS HE COULD HAVE BEEN
YOUR STALKER.

59
00:03:33,791 --> 00:03:37,458
- STALKER?  DO YOU THINK
HE WOULD HAVE THE GUTS?

60
00:03:37,541 --> 00:03:39,625
THIS IS A WASTE OF TIME.

61
00:03:39,708 --> 00:03:42,750
- ...from the start.
- Registration number 072...

62
00:03:42,833 --> 00:03:46,125
- THE FACE OF A FELLOW CITIZEN.

63
00:03:46,208 --> 00:03:48,958
THE FACE, THE FACE.
- My name is Vincent Law.

64
00:03:49,041 --> 00:03:53,000
I work for the AR Disposal Unit,
FG Temporary...

65
00:03:57,041 --> 00:03:58,750
- FELLOW CITIZENS,

66
00:03:58,833 --> 00:04:01,083
THE TIME IS NOW TO CONSUME.

67
00:04:01,166 --> 00:04:05,083
WHY SKIMP
WHEN YOU DESERVE MORE?

68
00:04:05,166 --> 00:04:08,166
- Iggy: AND THEY SAID
YOUR NEW REPLACEMENT HOME

69
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:09,958
WILL BE READY IN SIX HOURS.

70
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:13,375
Re-l: IN THAT CASE, I WANT
TO STOP BY THE CENTRAL MALL.

71
00:04:14,583 --> 00:04:16,333
I'LL GO ON A SHOPPING RAMPAGE

72
00:04:16,416 --> 00:04:19,958
AND GET SOME SHOES, A BELT,
UNDERWEAR, SHAMPOO,

73
00:04:20,041 --> 00:04:22,208
RINSE, MOISTURIZER
AND A TOOTHBRUSH.

74
00:04:22,291 --> 00:04:23,958
- OH, NO.
YOU MUSTN'T DO THAT.

75
00:04:24,041 --> 00:04:26,833
I KNOW YOU WANT TO FIND
AN OUTLET FOR YOUR FRUSTRATION,

76
00:04:26,916 --> 00:04:29,333
BUT FIRST WE NEED TO GO
TO DAEDALUS' PLACE.

77
00:04:29,416 --> 00:04:31,708
THEY SAID YOU NEED AN OFFICIAL
NOTE FROM THE DOCTOR

78
00:04:31,791 --> 00:04:34,958
IN ORDER TO RETURN
TO THE INTELLIGENCE BUREAU.

79
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:37,708
- IT'S JUST A SCRATCH. 
IT'S NOTHING SERIOUS.

80
00:04:37,791 --> 00:04:40,333
- IT'S NOT JUST
YOUR PHYSICAL HEALTH.

81
00:04:40,416 --> 00:04:44,458
YOU'VE HAD QUITE A SHOCK.
IT MAY HAVE AFFECTED YOUR MIND.

82
00:04:44,541 --> 00:04:46,875
- GIVE ME A GODDAMN BREAK.

83
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:54,791
- HOW CAN YOU SAY THAT
WHEN THERE'S NOTHING

84
00:04:54,875 --> 00:04:56,833
ABOUT THE MONSTER FROM LAST
NIGHT RECORDED INSIDE

85
00:04:56,916 --> 00:04:58,041
THAT HEAD OF YOURS?

86
00:05:11,708 --> 00:05:13,625
- WHAT'S WRONG?

87
00:05:13,708 --> 00:05:15,875
RE-L, YOU SHOULD CHEER UP.

88
00:05:15,958 --> 00:05:18,708
YOUR HOME LOOKS LIKE IT
WAS PRACTICALLY BLOWN UP.

89
00:05:18,791 --> 00:05:22,250
IT'S A MIRACLE THAT YOU ESCAPED
WITH SUCH MINOR INJURIES.

90
00:05:24,333 --> 00:05:26,708
I WAS SO WORRIED ABOUT YOU.

91
00:05:26,791 --> 00:05:31,250
EVEN AFTER ALL YOU'VE BEEN
THROUGH, YOU SURE ARE TOUGH.

92
00:05:31,333 --> 00:05:33,875
- SO HOW'S THE MURDER
INVESTIGATION GOING?

93
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:36,708
- OH, ABOUT THAT.

94
00:05:36,791 --> 00:05:38,833
- ( gasps )

95
00:05:38,916 --> 00:05:41,708
HOW CAN YOU RELIEVE ME
FROM MY DUTIES?

96
00:05:44,833 --> 00:05:47,666
- THE ORDER CAME FROM ABOVE.

97
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:49,166
THEY SAID YOU WERE
INJURED LAST NIGHT.

98
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:50,791
- ARE YOU TALKING
ABOUT THIS SCRATCH?

99
00:05:50,875 --> 00:05:53,041
- NO, IT'S FROM
THE SECURITY BUREAU.

100
00:05:53,125 --> 00:05:54,666
- IF I REMEMBER CORRECTLY,

101
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:56,666
THE REPORT STATED THERE
WAS A PROBLEM

102
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:58,125
REGARDING YOUR MENTAL CONDITION,

103
00:05:58,208 --> 00:06:00,208
SOMETHING AS A RESULT
FROM THE SHOCK.

104
00:06:00,291 --> 00:06:02,458
- A PATHOLOGICAL LYING EFFECT.

105
00:06:02,541 --> 00:06:04,458
- Re-l: THAT SOUNDS LIKE
SOMETHING THEY'D THINK UP.

106
00:06:04,541 --> 00:06:06,958
- Iggy: RE-L, SETTLE DOWN.
YOUR HEART-RATE IS--

107
00:06:07,041 --> 00:06:08,916
- MIND YOUR OWN DAMN BUSINESS.

108
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,291
IN THAT CASE,
HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN

109
00:06:10,375 --> 00:06:12,916
WHAT HAPPENED
AT THE OLD IMMIGRATION BUREAU?

110
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,583
THOSE MARKS WE FOUND
WEREN'T LEFT BY AN AUTOREIV.

111
00:06:16,666 --> 00:06:19,083
- YESTERDAY?
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

112
00:06:19,166 --> 00:06:21,625
- ( gasps )

113
00:06:21,708 --> 00:06:23,416
I DON'T BELIEVE IT.

114
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:26,166
THEY'VE EVEN ERASED HIS RECORD
OF THE INVESTIGATION.

115
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:30,791
- IN ORDER FOR YOU
TO RETURN TO WORK,

116
00:06:30,875 --> 00:06:33,166
FIRST WE NEED TO SEE
A PSYCHIATRIC EVALUATION

117
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:36,958
FROM YOUR DOCTOR.
- DR. DAEDALUS, RIGHT?

118
00:06:37,041 --> 00:06:39,333
HOW NICE TO HAVE THE HEALTH
AND WELFARE BUREAU'S CHIEF

119
00:06:39,416 --> 00:06:40,583
AS YOUR PHYSICIAN.

120
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:43,083
- THE HEALTH
AND WELFARE BUREAU.

121
00:06:44,666 --> 00:06:46,625
- THERE, YOU SEE?

122
00:06:46,708 --> 00:06:48,291
YOU'LL RECEIVE A KISS
FROM THE PRINCE

123
00:06:48,375 --> 00:06:49,958
AND THEN YOU'LL BE ALL BETTER.

124
00:06:50,041 --> 00:06:52,333
- I GUESS SO.

125
00:06:52,416 --> 00:06:55,041
VERY WELL THEN.
DO I HAVE AN APPOINTMENT?

126
00:06:55,125 --> 00:06:57,208
- HE SAID YOU'RE
WELCOME ANY TIME.

127
00:07:00,708 --> 00:07:04,375
- WAIT.  WHERE ARE YOU GOING
SO SUDDENLY?

128
00:07:06,208 --> 00:07:08,041
- OH, TAKE CARE THEN.

129
00:07:10,125 --> 00:07:13,458
- THE SECURITY BUREAU'S
GOING OUT OF CONTROL.

130
00:07:13,541 --> 00:07:17,000
THE INTELLIGENCE BUREAU'S
SILENCE.

131
00:07:17,083 --> 00:07:19,000
IGGY'S DATA BEING ERASED.

132
00:07:19,083 --> 00:07:21,833
THEY'RE ALL CONNECTED
TO THE MONSTER.

133
00:07:21,916 --> 00:07:25,083
THE POINTS ARE FORMING
A LINE.

134
00:07:25,166 --> 00:07:28,875
THAT'S RIGHT, ISN'T IT,
GRANDFATHER?

135
00:07:30,666 --> 00:07:33,000
- THIS WAS THE ESCAPE ROUTE
WE PREDICTED.

136
00:07:33,083 --> 00:07:35,166
SO IT HAS GONE
COMPLETELY OFF-COURSE.

137
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:38,333
- IT CAME BACK TO THE CITY EVEN
AFTER MAKING IT ALL THE WAY

138
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:40,583
TO THE IMMIGRANT DISTRICT
IN THE OUTER BLOCK.

139
00:07:40,666 --> 00:07:44,708
SO IT SEEMS THE PROXY
WAS AFTER RE-L.

140
00:07:44,791 --> 00:07:46,708
- I WAS NOT EXPECTING YOU
TO SAY THAT.

141
00:07:46,791 --> 00:07:49,041
ANY TRACES LEFT
BY THE PROXY AT THE SCENE

142
00:07:49,125 --> 00:07:51,041
WERE ELIMINATED
AFTER WE RECORDED THEM.

143
00:07:51,125 --> 00:07:53,333
WE'VE ALSO LIFTED
THE RESTRICTIONS PLACED

144
00:07:53,416 --> 00:07:56,125
ON RE-L MAYER.
- I UNDERSTAND.

145
00:07:56,208 --> 00:07:59,666
AFTER ALL, WE CAN'T ASK THE
REGENT FOR ANY ADDITIONAL TIME.

146
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:01,875
IF WE'RE FINISHED
WITH THE FORMAL QUESTIONING,

147
00:08:01,958 --> 00:08:03,791
WE CAN RELEASE THE IMMIGRANTS
AS WELL

148
00:08:03,875 --> 00:08:05,583
SINCE THEY AREN'T
REALLY SUSPECTS.

149
00:08:05,666 --> 00:08:09,000
- CONFIRMED.  WOULD YOU LIKE
TO SEE THE GIRL'S STATEMENT?

150
00:08:09,083 --> 00:08:13,083
- NO, SHE SIMPLY SUFFERED FROM
A CASE OF TEMPORARY INSANITY

151
00:08:13,166 --> 00:08:14,666
AS A RESULT
OF THE STALKER ATTACK

152
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:16,250
AND WAS IN SO MUCH SHOCK

153
00:08:16,333 --> 00:08:19,333
THAT SHE COULDN'T DISTINGUISH
BETWEEN REALITY AND ILLUSION.

154
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:22,041
- AS IS OFTEN THE CASE
WITH HUMANS, ISN'T IT?

155
00:08:22,125 --> 00:08:23,625
FOR ADDED ASSURANCE,

156
00:08:23,708 --> 00:08:25,916
I ARRANGED FOR HER TO SUBMIT 
WRITTEN PSYCHIATRIC EVALUATION

157
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,041
FROM HER DOCTOR AS A CONDITION
FOR HER RELEASE.

158
00:08:28,125 --> 00:08:29,708
- BEAUTIFUL.

159
00:08:29,791 --> 00:08:32,208
- NOW NO ONE WILL BELIEVE
HER TESTIMONY

160
00:08:32,291 --> 00:08:36,125
ABOUT WHAT SHE REALLY SAW,
WILL THEY?

161
00:08:36,208 --> 00:08:39,458
- THE SECRET OF THE PROXY
TAKES PRIORITY ABOVE ALL ELSE.

162
00:08:39,541 --> 00:08:42,500
- YES, A PSYCHOLOGICAL WAR,
ISN'T IT?

163
00:08:42,583 --> 00:08:44,625
- SHE MAY BE
THE REGENT'S GRANDDAUGHTER,

164
00:08:44,708 --> 00:08:47,083
BUT SHE CAN'T INTERFERE.
- VERY WELL THEN.

165
00:08:47,166 --> 00:08:49,958
I'LL HAVE THEM CONTINUE
WITH THEIR SEARCH FOR THE PROXY.

166
00:08:50,041 --> 00:08:51,958
- YES.

167
00:09:00,208 --> 00:09:03,875
- DOES IT HURT?
- IT'S OKAY.  THANK YOU.

168
00:09:03,958 --> 00:09:06,625
YOU'RE MAKING
TOO MUCH FUSS.

169
00:09:06,708 --> 00:09:09,708
- IN ANY CASE,
I'M GLAD YOU'RE SAFE.

170
00:09:09,791 --> 00:09:12,916
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I WOULD DO
IF SOMETHING...

171
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,083
- IT'S NOT THAT BIG A DEAL.

172
00:09:15,166 --> 00:09:17,500
BUT IF YOU REALLY FEEL THAT WAY,
I WISH YOU'D BELIEVE ME.

173
00:09:17,583 --> 00:09:20,791
HUH?
- HUH?

174
00:09:20,875 --> 00:09:24,500
- "HIGHLY SUGGESTS A CASE
OF FANTASTIC PSEUDOLOGY"?

175
00:09:27,875 --> 00:09:29,291
THEY GOT TO HIM.

176
00:09:29,375 --> 00:09:32,416
ALL THE SAME, DAEDALUS,

177
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:33,958
DO YOU UNDERSTAND
WHAT IT FEELS LIKE

178
00:09:34,041 --> 00:09:36,291
NOT HAVING ANYONE
WHO'LL BELIEVE ME?

179
00:09:38,625 --> 00:09:41,000
- I SEE.

180
00:09:41,083 --> 00:09:45,000
- I SAW THE MONSTER
WITH MY OWN EYES.

181
00:09:45,083 --> 00:09:46,791
- I WANT TO BELIEVE YOU.

182
00:09:46,875 --> 00:09:50,291
THAT'S WHY I'D LIKE TO EXAMINE
YOUR MIND A LITTLE MORE.

183
00:09:50,375 --> 00:09:52,625
- IT'S NOT A DELUSION.

184
00:09:52,708 --> 00:09:54,708
PLEASE, BELIEVE ME.

185
00:09:54,791 --> 00:09:57,000
- RE-L!

186
00:09:57,083 --> 00:09:58,666
ALL RIGHT, I UNDERSTAND.

187
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:00,750
- EVEN I CAN'T TELL ANYMORE

188
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:02,166
WHAT'S SUPPOSED TO BE REAL

189
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:04,041
AND WHAT'S SUPPOSED
TO BE A DREAM.

190
00:10:04,125 --> 00:10:06,916
- YOU'RE CONFUSING
YOUR MEMORIES.

191
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,041
BEFORE WE CONSIDER COUNSELING,

192
00:10:09,125 --> 00:10:12,208
I THINK WE SHOULD TRY
AND RUN A DETAILED BRAIN SCAN.

193
00:10:12,291 --> 00:10:15,250
IT'LL TAKE SOME TIME FOR US
TO SET EVERYTHING UP.

194
00:10:15,333 --> 00:10:17,333
WILL YOU BE ALL RIGHT?

195
00:10:17,416 --> 00:10:18,791
- IF YOU SAY SO, DAEDALUS.

196
00:10:18,875 --> 00:10:21,208
- WE'LL START SETTING IT ALL UP.

197
00:10:49,625 --> 00:10:53,041
- "SPECIMEN.  PROXY."

198
00:10:53,125 --> 00:10:55,791
- SORRY.  DIDN'T MEAN
'TO KEEP YOU WAITING.

199
00:10:57,458 --> 00:11:01,083
- OH, NO PROBLEM.

200
00:11:06,125 --> 00:11:08,041
- ( cooing )

201
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:10,208
- I CAN'T WAIT FOR YOU
TO MEET HIM.

202
00:11:10,291 --> 00:11:13,625
HE'S COMPLETELY ADORABLE.

203
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:19,458
ALL RIGHT THEN.
I'LL GO ON AHEAD.

204
00:11:20,833 --> 00:11:23,291
- Girl: EVERYTHING IS READY
FOR US TO LEAVE NOW.

205
00:11:24,875 --> 00:11:27,375
- ( gasps )
YOU STARTLED ME.

206
00:11:27,458 --> 00:11:30,208
APPLICATION ON.
- ( beeps )

207
00:11:30,291 --> 00:11:33,583
- Iggy: HOW DID IT GO?
- Re-l: PHYSICALLY, I'M FINE.

208
00:11:33,666 --> 00:11:36,083
MENTALLY, IT ALL DEPENDS
ON THEIR REPORT.

209
00:11:36,166 --> 00:11:38,583
- WONDERFUL.
NOW LET'S GO TO THE MALL.

210
00:11:38,666 --> 00:11:41,458
- BUT BEFORE THAT, IGGY, THERE'S
SOMETHING I WANT TO REFERENCE.

211
00:11:41,541 --> 00:11:43,083
- GO RIGHT AHEAD.

212
00:11:43,166 --> 00:11:45,416
CONNECT ME TO THE MAIN
INTELLIGENCE BANK.

213
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:47,750
- ( beeps )
- YOU ARE CONNECTED.

214
00:11:47,833 --> 00:11:50,375
- ENTER THE WORD "PROXY."

215
00:11:50,458 --> 00:11:51,916
- CONNECTION TERMINATED.

216
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,583
FORCED CUT OF TURING APPLICATION
FROM LANGUAGE FIELD.

217
00:11:54,666 --> 00:11:57,083
UNRECOGNIZABLE WORD STRING.

218
00:11:57,166 --> 00:11:59,125
WOULD YOU LIKE TO RE-ENTER?

219
00:11:59,208 --> 00:12:02,375
- I KNEW IT.
TURING ON.

220
00:12:02,458 --> 00:12:06,125
- SO, RE-L, WHAT WOULD
YOU LIKE TO LOOK UP?

221
00:12:06,208 --> 00:12:09,375
- FORGET ABOUT IT.
- WHAT'S WITH YOU?

222
00:12:09,458 --> 00:12:11,708
- ( beeps )
- HOLD ON A SEC.

223
00:12:11,791 --> 00:12:13,666
IT'S AN EMERGENCY CALL
FROM YOUR GRANDFATHER.

224
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:16,708
- HE'S MONITORING IGGY.

225
00:12:16,791 --> 00:12:19,291
- IT'S ABOUT WHAT
HAPPENED YESTERDAY.

226
00:12:19,375 --> 00:12:21,291
SHALL WE GO
AFTER WE DO OUR SHOPPING?

227
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:23,833
- LET'S JUST GO.
WE HAVE NO CHOICE.

228
00:13:01,666 --> 00:13:05,125
- Woman:
WE WERE JUST DISCUSSING YOU.

229
00:13:09,541 --> 00:13:10,875
- I'M VERY SORRY.

230
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:13,416
I APOLOGIZE FOR IGNORING
YOUR CALLS THESE PAST FEW DAYS.

231
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:16,166
- THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

232
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:19,875
HOWEVER, THE PROBLEM THAT WE
NEED TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT IS--

233
00:13:19,958 --> 00:13:21,250
- PROXY.

234
00:13:23,916 --> 00:13:26,916
- YOUR NEGLIGENCE
IN FOLLOWING PROCEDURES.

235
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,625
- Woman: SOMETIMES COOPERATION
WITH THE SECURITY BUREAU

236
00:13:29,708 --> 00:13:32,208
IS MORE IMPORTANT
THAN YOUR OWN EGO.

237
00:13:32,291 --> 00:13:33,750
- WHAT'S A PROXY?

238
00:13:33,833 --> 00:13:36,166
- Woman #2: RE-L,
I CANNOT UNDERSTAND

239
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:37,916
IF YOU WON'T TELL ME ANYTHING.

240
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,708
- ARE YOU IGNORING ME?

241
00:13:39,791 --> 00:13:42,625
IT'S BECAUSE I'M GETTING
TO THE HEART OF THE MATTER,

242
00:13:42,708 --> 00:13:45,791
ISN'T IT, GRANDFATHER?

243
00:13:45,875 --> 00:13:49,375
- Woman #2: IF YOU DO NOT WISH
TO ANSWER, THAT WILL BE ALL.

244
00:13:49,458 --> 00:13:52,500
- PLACE HER UNDER THE AUTHORITY
OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE BUREAU.

245
00:13:52,583 --> 00:13:56,250
- IT IS DONE.
- JUST A MINUTE.  HUSSERL!

246
00:13:56,333 --> 00:13:58,583
BERKELEY!  YOU CAN'T JUST
DECIDE THIS.

247
00:13:58,666 --> 00:14:00,583
LACAN.  DERRIDA.

248
00:14:06,666 --> 00:14:09,208
GRANDFATHER.

249
00:14:09,291 --> 00:14:10,666
- Woman: RE-L.

250
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:12,666
THEN PROMISE ME THIS.

251
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:17,000
THAT YOU WILL NO LONGER TAKE
THINGS INTO YOUR OWN HANDS.

252
00:14:17,083 --> 00:14:19,291
AGREED?
- DERRIDA.

253
00:14:19,375 --> 00:14:22,250
- IF YOU REFUSE,
THEN LIKE BERKELEY SAID,

254
00:14:22,333 --> 00:14:24,750
FROM NOW ON, YOU WILL BE PLACED
UNDER THE SUPERVISION

255
00:14:24,833 --> 00:14:26,666
OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE BUREAU.

256
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:28,916
- THEN I MUST AGREE.

257
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,958
- RE-L HAS GIVEN US
HER WORD.

258
00:14:32,041 --> 00:14:33,875
- NOW GO.

259
00:14:47,916 --> 00:14:49,541
- CAN IT BE?

260
00:14:52,541 --> 00:14:54,958
- IT'S TIME
FOR YOUR APPOINTMENT.

261
00:14:55,041 --> 00:14:58,041
- HUH?  IT ALREADY TIME?

262
00:14:59,916 --> 00:15:02,541
- IS THAT A REPORT
FROM THE LAB?

263
00:15:02,625 --> 00:15:04,458
WHY DON'T I TAKE OVER
FROM HERE?

264
00:15:04,541 --> 00:15:06,458
- THAT'S NOT NECESSARY.

265
00:15:06,541 --> 00:15:08,166
I'M ALMOST DONE,

266
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:11,000
BUT COULD YOU MAKE SURE
THAT A CAR IS READY TO GO?

267
00:15:11,083 --> 00:15:12,708
- AS YOU WISH.

268
00:15:23,916 --> 00:15:27,166
- THERE WERE TWO PROXIES.

269
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:29,125
I DON'T BELIEVE IT.

270
00:15:34,583 --> 00:15:37,083
- I JUST LOVE YOUR NEW PLACE,
DON'T YOU?

271
00:15:37,166 --> 00:15:39,625
AND YOU'VE GOT A GREAT VIEW
FROM HERE AS WELL.

272
00:15:39,708 --> 00:15:41,458
RE-L?

273
00:15:41,541 --> 00:15:45,708
- OH, I'M SORRY.
WERE YOU SAYING SOMETHING?

274
00:15:45,791 --> 00:15:47,916
- SO DID SOMETHING HAPPEN
WITH THE PRINCE?

275
00:15:49,875 --> 00:15:54,166
- IGGY, I KNOW YOU'RE
BEING MONITORED BY THEM.

276
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:56,333
I'M SORRY.

277
00:15:56,416 --> 00:16:00,083
- RE-L, WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

278
00:16:00,166 --> 00:16:03,166
- I'M JUST GOING TO GO
GET A CHANGE OF CLOTHES.

279
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:06,083
- GO GET?  BUT I THOUGHT
YOUR PLACE WAS STILL UNDER

280
00:16:06,166 --> 00:16:08,291
THE CONTROL
OF THE SECURITY BUREAU.

281
00:16:08,375 --> 00:16:10,916
- I WANNA GO OUTSIDE
AND CLEAR MY HEAD.

282
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,583
BESIDES, I'VE BEEN WEARING
THESE THINGS SINCE YESTERDAY.

283
00:16:13,666 --> 00:16:16,375
STARTING TOMORROW I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I'M GONNA DO ABOUT CLOTHES.

284
00:16:16,458 --> 00:16:19,375
- WELL, WHY DON'T YOU TAKE THIS
OPPORTUNITY TO BUY A NEW OUTFIT?

285
00:16:19,458 --> 00:16:21,875
YOU DON'T REALLY NEED TO GO
TO THAT PLACE, DO YOU?

286
00:16:21,958 --> 00:16:25,500
- IT'S NOT ENOUGH FOR
GRANDFATHER TO KEEP TABS ON ME.

287
00:16:25,583 --> 00:16:27,500
NOW HE WANTS TO GUIDE ME?

288
00:16:27,583 --> 00:16:31,000
WELL, THERE'S NOTHING I LIKE
IN THE STORES.

289
00:16:31,083 --> 00:16:33,541
- WHAT?  BUT JUST THIS MORNING
YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT

290
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:36,000
GOING ON A SHOPPING RAMPAGE.
HOLD ON.

291
00:16:36,083 --> 00:16:38,750
I KNOW A GREAT PLACE.
WE CAN GO THERE TOGETHER.

292
00:16:44,791 --> 00:16:46,958
HOW ABOUT THIS ONE?

293
00:16:47,041 --> 00:16:50,208
THE COLOR'S IN SEASON
RIGHT NOW.

294
00:16:51,666 --> 00:16:53,750
RE-L?

295
00:16:53,833 --> 00:16:55,250
- FELLOW CITIZENS,

296
00:16:55,333 --> 00:16:58,458
DO YOUR PART AND MAKE WASTE.

297
00:16:58,541 --> 00:17:02,250
LIFE IS EASIER
WHEN YOU LIGHTEN THE LOAD.

298
00:17:02,333 --> 00:17:04,958
THE TIME IS NOW TO CONSUME.

299
00:17:05,041 --> 00:17:07,916
WHY SKIMP
WHEN YOU DESERVE MORE?

300
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,583
- ( baby cooing )

301
00:17:23,791 --> 00:17:27,666
- ( woman screams )
- ( man grunts )

302
00:17:49,666 --> 00:17:52,041
- THAT'S--

303
00:17:57,583 --> 00:18:00,583
- ( shouting )

304
00:19:17,416 --> 00:19:20,333
- ( clamoring )

305
00:19:20,416 --> 00:19:21,791
- CHIEF RAUL.

306
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,250
THE SECURITY BUREAU IS
AWAITING INSTRUCTIONS.

307
00:19:30,541 --> 00:19:33,041
- REQUEST EMERGENCY DEPLOYMENT
OF ARMED AUTOREIVS.

308
00:19:33,125 --> 00:19:35,166
SEAL OFF ROETHELIS PARK

309
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:37,708
AND THE SURROUNDING AREAS
COMPLETELY.

310
00:19:37,791 --> 00:19:40,458
USE THE PARTITIONS.
- AS YOU WISH.

311
00:20:07,958 --> 00:20:10,750
