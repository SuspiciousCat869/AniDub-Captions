1
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:38,625
- Raul: SO HOW DOES HE SEEM?

2
00:00:38,708 --> 00:00:43,000
- Kristeva:
CITIZEN REGISTRATION #021723, 

3
00:00:43,083 --> 00:00:45,791
FORMER CHIEF OF THE HEALTH
AND WELFARE BUREAU,

4
00:00:45,875 --> 00:00:48,125
DAEDALUS YUMENO.

5
00:00:48,208 --> 00:00:49,750
HE'S BEEN STRIPPED
OF HIS AUTHORITY

6
00:00:49,833 --> 00:00:51,416
BY THE ADMINISTRATIVE BUREAU.

7
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:54,625
HE'S BEEN A QUIET INDIVIDUAL
AND HAS KEPT A LOW PROFILE

8
00:00:54,708 --> 00:00:56,625
SINCE BEING REPLACED.

9
00:00:56,708 --> 00:01:00,291
- DO YOU KNOW THE REASON WHY,
KRISTEVA?

10
00:01:00,375 --> 00:01:02,958
- YOU SEEM TO BE
IN A GOOD MOOD TODAY.

11
00:01:03,041 --> 00:01:05,250
- OH, DO I?

12
00:01:05,333 --> 00:01:06,791
PERHAPS.

13
00:01:06,875 --> 00:01:08,958
BUT I'M ACCEPTING
WHO I AM

14
00:01:09,041 --> 00:01:10,958
AND LOOKING FORWARD
TO REACHING HEIGHTS

15
00:01:11,041 --> 00:01:13,125
WHERE OTHER PEOPLE
ARE NO LONGER NECESSARY.

16
00:01:15,083 --> 00:01:18,500
I'M NOT WORRIED
ABOUT MONSTERS ANYMORE.

17
00:01:18,583 --> 00:01:21,833
HOWEVER, THAT MAN
IS DIFFERENT.

18
00:01:21,916 --> 00:01:24,750
THE REGENT'S
LOVELY GRANDDAUGHTER,

19
00:01:24,833 --> 00:01:26,625
RE-L MAYER HAS DIED,

20
00:01:26,708 --> 00:01:28,916
ALONG WITH A PROXY
NAMED MONAD,

21
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
WHICH SHE WAS ALSO HIDING.

22
00:01:32,541 --> 00:01:35,666
THAT MAN
HAS LOST HIS RAISON D'ETRE.

23
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:38,500
- YOU MEAN HIS REASON
FOR BEING?

24
00:01:38,583 --> 00:01:40,458
- LOOK AT THIS BEAUTIFUL WORLD

25
00:01:40,541 --> 00:01:42,833
IN WHICH EVERYTHING
HAS ITS PURPOSE.

26
00:01:42,916 --> 00:01:45,333
AND WE ARE ALL CREATED
AS INDIVIDUAL COGS

27
00:01:45,416 --> 00:01:47,458
FOR THE BETTERMENT
OF THIS PARADISE,

28
00:01:47,541 --> 00:01:49,541
PERMITTED TO EXIST
ONLY FOR THE SAKE

29
00:01:49,625 --> 00:01:52,583
OF FULFILLING REASONS
THAT ARE GIVEN IN ADVANCE.

30
00:01:52,666 --> 00:01:54,666
BUT FOR DAEDALUS YUMENO,

31
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:59,083
ALL AT ONCE, HE HAS LOST
HIS OWN RAISON D'ETRE.

32
00:01:59,166 --> 00:02:02,541
BOTH THE PROXY
AND RE-L MAYER.

33
00:02:05,416 --> 00:02:07,666
- ( computer scanning )

34
00:02:11,166 --> 00:02:15,250
- YOU MIGHT SAY
HE'S A BROKEN COG.

35
00:02:34,708 --> 00:02:36,791
Ergo:
RE-L.

36
00:02:39,166 --> 00:02:41,916

- Male voice: AN ENTITY
SEALED FOR ETERNITY

49
00:04:30,875 --> 00:04:33,791
AND SAID TO BE IMMORTAL

50
00:04:33,875 --> 00:04:35,666
HAS BEEN LOST.

51
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:38,250
- Female voice:
DO YOU KNOW THE REASON WHY?

52
00:04:38,333 --> 00:04:41,125
- THIS AWAKENING
HAS INVITED DESTRUCTION

53
00:04:41,208 --> 00:04:44,583
AND THE BLOOD CONTINUES
TO FLOW IN OUR PARADISE.

54
00:04:44,666 --> 00:04:47,625
- Female voice #2:
DO YOU KNOW THE REASON WHY?

55
00:04:47,708 --> 00:04:49,750
- Kristeva: WE'VE ALREADY
SUBMITTED OUR REPORT,

56
00:04:49,833 --> 00:04:53,583
BUT THE PROBLEMS
WE MUST ADDRESS ARE MOUNTING.

57
00:04:53,666 --> 00:04:56,583
POWER SHORTAGES FOR THE MAGNETIC
AND FIELD LIFE-SUPPORT SYSTEM

58
00:04:56,666 --> 00:05:00,375
IN THE DOME'S OUTER BLOCK
ARE A SOURCE OF CONCERN.

59
00:05:00,458 --> 00:05:04,625
THE ENTIRE SYSTEM NEEDS
TO BE OVERHAULED IMMEDIATELY.

60
00:05:04,708 --> 00:05:08,666
- Female voice: THAT IS THE
ANSWER TO WHICH YOU'VE ARRIVED?

61
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:11,000
- Female voice #2: QUESTIONS
ARE A BURDEN UPON OTHERS.

62
00:05:11,083 --> 00:05:13,375
ANSWERS ARE A BURDEN
UPON YOURSELF.

63
00:05:13,458 --> 00:05:16,875
- Male voice: UNDERSTAND THAT
WHAT HAPPENED TO RE-L MAYER

64
00:05:16,958 --> 00:05:19,708
COULD VERY WELL
HAVE HAPPENED TO YOU.

65
00:05:19,791 --> 00:05:22,875
Male voice #2:
YOU KNOW THE REASON,

66
00:05:22,958 --> 00:05:25,583
DON'T YOU, RAUL?

67
00:05:27,958 --> 00:05:31,416
- ( choir chanting ) 
- Female voice: THAT'S ENOUGH.

68
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,916
WE MUST THINK
OF WHAT TO DO

69
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,375
NOW THAT THE PROXY
IS GONE.

70
00:05:36,458 --> 00:05:39,666
- Male voice:
WE UNDERSTAND TOO LITTLE.

71
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:42,666
- Female voice:
THEREFORE WE MUST THINK.

72
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:45,583
- Male voice: THEREFORE
WE MUST THINK.

73
00:05:45,666 --> 00:05:47,250
- Female voice: WE MUST THINK.

74
00:05:47,333 --> 00:05:48,916
- Female voice #2:
WE MUST THINK.

75
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,916
- Male voice: WE MUST THINK.

76
00:05:52,166 --> 00:05:53,666
- ( grunting ) 
- ( glass smashing )

77
00:05:56,333 --> 00:05:58,625
- GODDAMN ENTOURAGES.

78
00:06:03,125 --> 00:06:06,333
"I THINK THEREFORE I AM."

79
00:06:16,791 --> 00:06:19,708
- CHIEF,
YOU'VE INJURED YOURSELF.

80
00:06:19,791 --> 00:06:22,708
- THE WOUND YOU SEE
IS NOTHING.

81
00:06:22,791 --> 00:06:25,000
- JUST TO BE SAFE,
YOU SHOULD BE EXAMINED

82
00:06:25,083 --> 00:06:26,625
BY THE HEALTH
AND WELFARE BUREAU.

83
00:06:26,708 --> 00:06:28,791
- THE REGENT NEVER ANSWERS
DIRECTLY.

84
00:06:28,875 --> 00:06:32,333
HE MERELY POSES QUESTIONS.
WHY IS THAT?

85
00:06:32,416 --> 00:06:34,333
- IT'S HARD TO KNOW WHY.

86
00:06:34,416 --> 00:06:36,375
- BUT I KNOW WHY.

87
00:06:36,458 --> 00:06:39,458
IT'S THE WAILING OF SOMEONE
WHO SUDDENLY LOST THE PERSON

88
00:06:39,541 --> 00:06:40,625
THEY LOVED THE MOST.

89
00:06:40,708 --> 00:06:43,750
AND YET,
WHY DOES THE REGENT LOOK AWAY?

90
00:06:43,833 --> 00:06:45,291
WHY?

91
00:06:45,375 --> 00:06:46,958
WHY?!

92
00:06:49,083 --> 00:06:51,625
IN REALITY,
ROMDEAU IS NOTHING BUT A--

93
00:06:51,708 --> 00:06:54,416
- ( ship clanging ) 
 - WHAT'S HAPPENING?!

94
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:57,333
- EMERGENCY STOP CODE,
ACKNOWLEDGED.

95
00:06:57,416 --> 00:07:00,625
EMERGENCY USE PHASE,
SEQUENCE START.

96
00:07:00,708 --> 00:07:02,458
CONFIRMED.

97
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,416
- POWER WAS AUTOMATICALLY
RESTORED

98
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:14,166
AFTER THE TWO-MINUTE-
AND-17-SECOND INTERRUPTION.

99
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:16,500
WE STILL HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE
TO PINPOINT THE CAUSE.

100
00:07:16,583 --> 00:07:19,333
BUT THIS TIME, THE POWER FAILURE
DID NOT INTERFERE

101
00:07:19,416 --> 00:07:21,000
WITH THE LIFE-SUPPORT SYSTEM.

102
00:07:21,083 --> 00:07:22,708
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
"THIS TIME"?

103
00:07:22,791 --> 00:07:25,166
- FOR THE PAST THREE WEEKS,
WE'VE BEEN ENCOUNTERING

104
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:28,166
POWER FAILURES
SIMILAR IN NATURE TO THIS ONE.

105
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:31,000
- DID WE EVER RECEIVE A REPORT
ABOUT THESE FAILURES?

106
00:07:31,083 --> 00:07:33,083
- NO.
- THEY WERE ALL INTERMITTENT

107
00:07:33,166 --> 00:07:35,250
AND NONE OF THEM LASTED MORE
THAN A FRACTION OF A SECOND.

108
00:07:35,333 --> 00:07:38,000
SO YOU SEE,
THEY WERE TREATED AS ACCIDENTS.

109
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:41,666
- AN ANALYSIS INDICATED THERE
WAS POSSIBLE HUMAN INVOLVEMENT.

110
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:44,708
THE REPORT DID NOT PRESENT
ANYTHING SPECIFIC.

111
00:07:44,791 --> 00:07:46,541
- MAYBE AN INFECTED AUTO REIV?

112
00:07:46,625 --> 00:07:47,833
DOUBTFUL.

113
00:07:47,916 --> 00:07:49,375
BUT AN IMMIGRANT
TERRORIST GROUP?

114
00:07:49,458 --> 00:07:51,958
THAT WOULD
MAKE MORE SENSE.

115
00:07:52,041 --> 00:07:54,583
HMM.

116
00:07:54,666 --> 00:07:57,666
TWO MINUTES, 17 SECONDS?

117
00:07:59,625 --> 00:08:01,458
KRISTEVA?
- YES?

118
00:08:01,541 --> 00:08:03,208
- WHAT DO YOU THINK?

119
00:08:03,291 --> 00:08:05,291
- JUDGING FROM THE TIME
ON THE EFFECT,

120
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:07,833
IT CAN BE SURMISED THAT THE
POWER STOPPAGES UP UNTIL NOW

121
00:08:07,916 --> 00:08:10,791
WERE CARRIED OUT IN ORDER
TO DECEIVE THE SECURITY BUREAU.

122
00:08:10,875 --> 00:08:13,750
THEY WERE TESTS
CONDUCTED FOR THAT PURPOSE.

123
00:08:13,833 --> 00:08:15,208
- BEAUTIFUL.

124
00:08:15,291 --> 00:08:17,166
AND THIS TIME?

125
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:20,500
- IT IS FAIR TO ASSUME THAT
IT WAS SOME TYPE OF WARNING.

126
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:22,166
- I SEE.

127
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:23,583
AND WHY IS THAT?

128
00:08:23,666 --> 00:08:26,916
- THE CITY'S LIFE-SUPPORT SYSTEM
CAN ONLY BE MAINTAINED

129
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,583
FOR UP TO THREE MINUTES
DURING A POWER OUTAGE.

130
00:08:29,666 --> 00:08:32,625
- WHICH MEANS
THAT WHOEVER WAS RESPONSIBLE

131
00:08:32,708 --> 00:08:34,625
DIDN'T WANT ANYONE TO DIE.

132
00:08:34,708 --> 00:08:36,375
- YES, SIR.

133
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,250
- YOU WERE RIGHT.

134
00:08:43,333 --> 00:08:45,791
I REALLY SHOULD
GO SEE A DOCTOR.

135
00:08:47,958 --> 00:08:49,916
MAKE AN APPOINTMENT
WITH THIS ONE.

136
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,250
BUT, CHIEF,
HE IS NO LONGER AUTHORIZED.

137
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:55,625
- THERE IS SOMETHING ELSE
THAT I WANT YOU TO DO.

138
00:08:55,708 --> 00:08:59,416
I WANT YOU TO LOOK FOR THE
RESEARCH DATA HE WAS HIDING.

139
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:02,791
- I'M NO LONGER
CONDUCTING EXAMINATIONS...

140
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:04,625
ANYMORE.

141
00:09:04,708 --> 00:09:07,000
- FOR SOMEONE WHO LOOKS
LIKE A YOUNG BOY,

142
00:09:07,083 --> 00:09:09,375
YOU'RE ACTING
LIKE A VERY BOLD MAN.

143
00:09:09,458 --> 00:09:12,000
- I'D LIKE TO ASK
FOR YOU TO LEAVE.

144
00:09:12,083 --> 00:09:15,083
- SORRY.  SHOULD I HAVE SAID
A ROMANTICIST?

145
00:09:15,166 --> 00:09:16,916
- I'LL HAVE DELEUZE
MAKE ARRANGEMENTS

146
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,583
FOR YOU TO SEE
ANOTHER DOCTOR.

147
00:09:18,666 --> 00:09:21,666
- NOW THEN, WHAT IS IT
YOU WANT TO SAY TO ME?

148
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:23,666
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN.

149
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:26,958
- GOING THROUGH ALL THAT TROUBLE
TO CALL ME HERE.

150
00:09:27,041 --> 00:09:29,958
- I'M SORRY FOR ALL THE TROUBLE,
CHIEF RAUL.

151
00:09:30,041 --> 00:09:32,083
BUT HONESTLY,

152
00:09:32,166 --> 00:09:34,666
I HAVE NOTHING
TO SAY TO YOU ANYMORE.

153
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:38,375
I WAS CREATED IN ORDER
TO PROTECT THE SPECIMEN

154
00:09:38,458 --> 00:09:42,708
AND RE-L,
TO RAISE THEM IN GOOD HEALTH.

155
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:46,125
BUT NOW
THAT I'VE LOST BOTH OF THEM,

156
00:09:46,208 --> 00:09:50,666
IT SEEMS I'VE LOST
MY RAISON D'ETRE.

157
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:52,125
- AND SHORTLY AFTER THAT

158
00:09:52,208 --> 00:09:54,416
IS WHEN I HEARD
YOUR HEARTFELT CRY.

159
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:57,208
SO I CAME OVER TO OFFER
WHAT LITTLE HELP I COULD.

160
00:09:57,291 --> 00:10:00,083
- THEN YOU MUST
BE A TELEPATH.

161
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:03,083
- ( laughs )

162
00:10:03,166 --> 00:10:05,333
AS STRANGE AS IT SOUNDS,

163
00:10:05,416 --> 00:10:08,583
FOR SOME REASON IT ONLY SEEMS TO
WORK WITH YOU, DAEDALUS YUMENO.

164
00:10:08,666 --> 00:10:11,833
AMUSING, ISN'T IT?

165
00:10:11,916 --> 00:10:14,916
IT LOOKS LIKE HE'S AGREED
TO GIVE ME MY MEDICAL EXAM.

166
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,250
DURING WHICH TIME,
I WANT YOU TO HURRY UP

167
00:10:17,333 --> 00:10:19,833
AND SEARCH FOR THE DATA
I INSTRUCTED YOU ABOUT EARLIER.

168
00:10:19,916 --> 00:10:21,541
- Kristeva:
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

169
00:10:21,625 --> 00:10:24,833
- I BELIEVE HE COULD USE
A BREATH OF FRESH AIR.

170
00:10:24,916 --> 00:10:26,833
NO CAUSE FOR ALARM.

171
00:10:26,916 --> 00:10:30,083
- CHIEF, HE IS STILL NOT
PERMITTED TO LEAVE THE PREMISES.

172
00:10:30,166 --> 00:10:32,666
- I BELIEVE THAT IS UP TO ME
TO DECIDE,

173
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:35,333
IS IT NOT?
- YES, CERTAINLY.

174
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:43,958
- WHY ARE YOU BEING SO MEAN?

175
00:10:44,041 --> 00:10:46,458
THERE ISN'T ANY DATA HERE.

176
00:10:46,541 --> 00:10:49,458
- BUT SHE'LL KEEP SEARCHING
UNTIL SHE FINDS SOMETHING.

177
00:10:49,541 --> 00:10:51,125
SHE'S VERY PROFESSIONAL.

178
00:10:51,208 --> 00:10:55,125
- SO NOW WE HAVE PLENTY OF TIME
FOR OURSELVES.

179
00:10:55,208 --> 00:10:58,583
IT'S OKAY.

180
00:10:58,666 --> 00:11:01,625
THE REPRESENTATIVE DOESN'T HAVE
ANY CONNECTION TO THEM.

181
00:11:01,708 --> 00:11:02,958
- REPRESENTATIVE?

182
00:11:03,041 --> 00:11:05,166
( laughs )
YOU MEAN THE REGENT?

183
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:06,375
IMPRESSIVE.

184
00:11:06,458 --> 00:11:08,666
YOU DON'T LEAVE ANYTHING
TO CHANCE.

185
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:11,708
- THAT'S WHY YOU INSISTED
ON HAVING AN UNEMPLOYED DOCTOR

186
00:11:11,791 --> 00:11:14,666
GIVE YOU A MEDICAL EXAM,
AM I RIGHT?

187
00:11:16,833 --> 00:11:20,291
YOU IMPRESS ME. YOU FIGURED
IT OUT QUICKER THAN I THOUGHT.

188
00:11:20,375 --> 00:11:22,416
- YOU'VE BEEN HAVING
TOO MUCH FUN.

189
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:25,083
- AND YOU SCARE
FAR TOO EASILY.

190
00:11:25,166 --> 00:11:26,625
I'M WELL AWARE OF WHAT

191
00:11:26,708 --> 00:11:29,000
THE LIFE-SUPPORT SYSTEM'S
LIMITATIONS ARE.

192
00:11:29,083 --> 00:11:31,958
- THE REGENT SEEMS
TO HAVE TAKEN THE DISRUPTION

193
00:11:32,041 --> 00:11:33,583
AS A WARNING FROM SOMEONE.

194
00:11:33,666 --> 00:11:36,416
- YOU DID A VERY GOOD JOB
OF MISLEADING HIM.

195
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:39,083
ALL THAT'S LEFT
IS FOR THE SECURITY BUREAU

196
00:11:39,166 --> 00:11:41,791
TO MAKE THE APPROPRIATE ARRESTS
WHEN THE TIME IS RIGHT.

197
00:11:41,875 --> 00:11:43,583
- DAEDALUS YUMENO,

198
00:11:43,666 --> 00:11:47,125
CITIZEN #021723.

199
00:11:47,208 --> 00:11:50,083
- TWO MINUTES, 17.23 SECONDS.

200
00:11:50,166 --> 00:11:53,166
I TESTED IT MANY TIMES
TO GET IT RIGHT.

201
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:55,416
- I SUPPOSE
THAT YOU'RE MAKING A THREAT?

202
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:58,166
- THREATS ARE VERY EFFECTIVE.

203
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:01,208
YOU'RE PROBABLY WONDERING
WHETHER YOU'LL BE EXPOSED

204
00:12:01,291 --> 00:12:04,000
FOR ELIMINATING SOMEONE
WHO WAS IN YOUR WAY.

205
00:12:04,083 --> 00:12:05,458
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

206
00:12:05,541 --> 00:12:08,000
- YOU NEVER SHOULD HAVE USED
THE COGITO VIRUS.

207
00:12:10,041 --> 00:12:11,958
SHALL WE CUT THE ACT?

208
00:12:12,041 --> 00:12:14,333
THE REASON WE WENT
THROUGH ALL THIS TROUBLE

209
00:12:14,416 --> 00:12:17,250
WAS SO WE COULD TALK WITHOUT THE
REGENT BEING ABLE TO HEAR US.

210
00:12:17,333 --> 00:12:20,208
ARE YOU GOING
TO GET RID OF ME NOW TOO?

211
00:12:20,291 --> 00:12:22,333
PERHAPS THIS WASN'T ENOUGH,

212
00:12:22,416 --> 00:12:24,958
DEPRIVING ME OF BOTH
MY TREASURE AND MY JOB?

213
00:12:25,041 --> 00:12:28,875
- THE ONLY ONE YOU HAVE TO BLAME
FOR ALL OF THIS IS YOURSELF.

214
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:33,791
YOU CONFUSED THE REGENT BY
USING THE MONAD PROXY AS BAIT.

215
00:12:33,875 --> 00:12:37,375
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO TOOK ACTIONS
TO HIDE IT FROM HIM.

216
00:12:40,333 --> 00:12:42,250
- SO I SEE.

217
00:12:42,333 --> 00:12:45,208
- NO MATTER HOW DESPERATE
YOU HAD BECOME,

218
00:12:45,291 --> 00:12:49,208
THERE WAS SOMETHING WHICH YOU
HAD TO CONCEAL FROM THE REGENT--

219
00:12:49,291 --> 00:12:53,500
THE FACT
THAT THERE WAS ANOTHER PROXY.

220
00:12:53,583 --> 00:12:55,708
YOU HAD REACHED A DEAD END
IN YOUR WORK

221
00:12:55,791 --> 00:12:58,250
AND THE ESCAPE INCIDENT
WAS A CONVENIENT WAY

222
00:12:58,333 --> 00:13:00,541
FOR YOU TO HIDE THE EXISTENCE
OF THE OTHER PROXY

223
00:13:00,625 --> 00:13:02,208
FROM THE COLLECTIVE.

224
00:13:02,291 --> 00:13:04,250
- YES, THAT'S RIGHT.

225
00:13:04,333 --> 00:13:06,250
- BUT THAT'S NOT ALL.

226
00:13:06,333 --> 00:13:09,166
I KNOW YOU'VE HIDDEN
SOMETHING ELSE FROM THEM.

227
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:11,833
AND THAT...

228
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:15,541
IS THE FACT
THAT RE-L MAYER IS ALIVE.

229
00:13:45,333 --> 00:13:47,833
- ( whirring )
- ( gasps )

230
00:13:57,083 --> 00:13:58,291
( grunts )

231
00:13:58,375 --> 00:14:00,041
- ARE YOU ALL RIGHT, RE-L?

232
00:14:00,125 --> 00:14:01,375
- YEAH.

233
00:14:01,458 --> 00:14:03,416
SO DID YOU FIND ANYONE?

234
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:07,291
- WELL, I THOUGHT RESEARCHING
THE POWER PLANT CAME FIRST?

235
00:14:07,375 --> 00:14:09,833
AFTER ALL,
NOW THAT WE'RE ON THE OUTSIDE,

236
00:14:09,916 --> 00:14:12,416
THE POWER SUPPLY
IS OUR #1 CONCERN.

237
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:16,416
- IGGY--
- DON'T WORRY YOURSELF, RE-L.

238
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:20,166
THE TOWN IS A BIT RETRO,
BUT THE TECHNOLOGY IS TOP-NOTCH.

239
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:22,208
THE ENERGY SOURCE
IS COMPATIBLE,

240
00:14:22,291 --> 00:14:23,666
AND ONCE IT'S CONNECTED,
WE SHOULD BE ABLE

241
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:24,708
TO GET IT TO INTERACT WITH--

242
00:14:24,791 --> 00:14:27,458
- IGGY?
- HMM?

243
00:14:27,541 --> 00:14:29,958
- THERE ARE NO PEOPLE
IN THIS TOWN.

244
00:14:37,458 --> 00:14:40,916
- THEY WENT OUTSIDE THE DOME,
RIGHT?

245
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,166
I'M SURE YOU'VE FOOLED
THE REGENT,

246
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:48,625
SINCE WE ALL KNOW THAT LEAVING
THIS PARADISE MEANS DEATH,

247
00:14:48,708 --> 00:14:51,375
EVEN FOR A REALIST
LIKE RE-L MAYER.

248
00:14:51,458 --> 00:14:53,500
SO TO RISK HER OWN LIFE,

249
00:14:53,583 --> 00:14:56,958
IT MUST HAVE BEEN HER
RAISON D'ETRE THAT DROVE HER,

250
00:14:57,041 --> 00:14:59,750
WHICH IS, OF COURSE,
THE PROXY.

251
00:14:59,833 --> 00:15:02,958
YOU DECIDED TO SEND HER OUT

252
00:15:03,041 --> 00:15:06,083
IN ORDER TO OBTAIN
ANOTHER PROXY, DIDN'T YOU?

253
00:15:06,166 --> 00:15:08,083
BUT NOW YOU'RE
STARTING TO REALIZE

254
00:15:08,166 --> 00:15:10,250
THAT YOUR PLAN WILL NEVER WORK.

255
00:15:10,333 --> 00:15:13,166
AND NOW YOU FEAR
LOSING HER AS WELL.

256
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:16,000
BECAUSE YOU KNOW
THAT YOU CAN'T PROTECT HER

257
00:15:16,083 --> 00:15:18,083
ONCE SHE'S ON THE OUTSIDE.

258
00:15:18,166 --> 00:15:20,875
THAT'S WHY YOU SENT ME
YOUR CLEVER LITTLE MESSAGE.

259
00:15:20,958 --> 00:15:24,250
- YOU THINK
I WOULD EVER WORK WITH YOU,

260
00:15:24,333 --> 00:15:27,000
THE PERSON WHO TRIED
TO KILL RE-L?

261
00:15:29,416 --> 00:15:31,833
- AND YOU THINK IT WAS ME.

262
00:15:35,208 --> 00:15:36,791
- YOU MEAN--

263
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:42,333
Re-l: MAYBE IT'S BETTER
HERE WITHOUT ANY PEOPLE.

264
00:15:42,416 --> 00:15:45,625
THESE MACHINES--
THEY'LL KEEP ON WORKING

265
00:15:45,708 --> 00:15:48,583
UNTIL THE WORLD
ROTS AWAY.

266
00:15:48,666 --> 00:15:50,083
BUT FOR WHO?

267
00:15:50,166 --> 00:15:53,625
WORKING, EVEN THOUGH
THEY'VE LOST THE VERY PEOPLE

268
00:15:53,708 --> 00:15:56,500
WHO GAVE A REASON
FOR THEIR EXISTENCE.

269
00:15:56,583 --> 00:16:00,208
MAYBE THEY DIDN'T HAVE A REASON
TO BEGIN WITH.

270
00:16:00,291 --> 00:16:02,750
- RE-L?
- SORRY.

271
00:16:02,833 --> 00:16:05,208
I WAS JUST WONDERING IF--

272
00:16:05,291 --> 00:16:07,166
IF I WASN'T HERE,
WHAT WOULD YOU DO?

273
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:09,750
- DON'T EVEN SAY SOMETHING
LIKE THAT.

274
00:16:09,833 --> 00:16:12,958
HOW ABOUT YOU? WHAT WOULD
YOU DO IF I WASN'T HERE?

275
00:16:14,875 --> 00:16:16,416
YOU SILLY.

276
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,583
YOU KNOW
I'D NEVER LEAVE YOU.

277
00:16:18,666 --> 00:16:21,416
- THAT WAS A VERY BAD JOKE.

278
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:23,666
- BUT YOU'RE LAUGHING,
AREN'T YOU?

279
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:26,041
HEY, RE-L,
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

280
00:16:26,125 --> 00:16:28,041
- DON'T WORRY.

281
00:16:28,125 --> 00:16:30,791
I WAS JUST DRIFTING OUT
FOR A MOMENT.

282
00:16:30,875 --> 00:16:33,958
- EVERYONE GETS TIRED
EVENTUALLY-- EVEN YOU, RE-L.

283
00:16:34,041 --> 00:16:36,250
I'LL GO GET SUPPLIES
FOR THE MACHINE

284
00:16:36,333 --> 00:16:38,000
AND YOU GET SOME REST.

285
00:16:38,083 --> 00:16:40,166
- Re-l:
SOMETIMES I HAVE FEARS.

286
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:42,625
WHAT AM I HERE FOR?

287
00:16:42,708 --> 00:16:46,958
THE PURPOSE OF THE TRIP
IS TO FIND AN ANSWER.

288
00:16:47,041 --> 00:16:50,833
BUT SUPPOSE
I FIND THE PROXY.

289
00:16:50,916 --> 00:16:52,958
WHAT DO I DO THEN?

290
00:16:55,166 --> 00:16:57,708
- WHY WOULD THE REPRESENTATIVE
DO THAT?

291
00:16:57,791 --> 00:16:59,750
- YOU REALLY ARE
STILL JUST A BOY.

292
00:16:59,833 --> 00:17:02,875
IT SEEMS SHE TOOK THE REGENT
TOO LIGHTLY.

293
00:17:02,958 --> 00:17:05,291
IT DOESN'T MATTER
IF SHE WAS HIS GRANDDAUGHTER.

294
00:17:05,375 --> 00:17:07,416
SHE WAS ALREADY GUILTY
OF TREASON.

295
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:10,541
THE LAW IS THE LAW
AND THERE CAN BE NO EXCEPTION.

296
00:17:10,625 --> 00:17:15,291
DID YOU THINK YOU'D GET
AWAY WITH IT SO EASILY?

297
00:17:15,375 --> 00:17:18,041
I'LL ASK YOU AGAIN
ABOUT THE POWER OUTAGE.

298
00:17:18,125 --> 00:17:20,708
- IT WAS A MESSAGE.
- I'M NOT SUCH AN OPTIMIST

299
00:17:20,791 --> 00:17:23,208
AS TO TAKE THINGS
AT FACE VALUE.

300
00:17:23,291 --> 00:17:26,125
I KNOW POISONED BAIT
THE MOMENT I SEE IT.

301
00:17:26,208 --> 00:17:29,791
BY CREATING THE POWER OUTAGE
THIS TIME,

302
00:17:29,875 --> 00:17:32,750
YOU WERE ABLE TO OBTAIN
ENORMOUS AMOUNTS OF ENERGY.

303
00:17:32,833 --> 00:17:34,791
SO WHAT DID YOU USE IT FOR?

304
00:17:34,875 --> 00:17:37,958
- I TRIED TO RESUSCITATE
THE PROXY.

305
00:17:38,041 --> 00:17:40,083
- BEAUTIFUL.

306
00:17:40,166 --> 00:17:42,750
IF YOU AGREE
TO THE FOLLOWING PROPOSAL,

307
00:17:42,833 --> 00:17:45,333
I'LL GIVE YOU A TOY.

308
00:17:45,416 --> 00:17:47,625
ALTHOUGH GIVEN
YOUR CURRENT SITUATION,

309
00:17:47,708 --> 00:17:50,958
YOU DON'T HAVE
MUCH OF A CHOICE.

310
00:17:51,041 --> 00:17:52,833
- Daedalus: A TOY?

311
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,375
- ( sighs )

312
00:18:05,916 --> 00:18:09,833
( grunts ) WHERE THE
HELL DID YOU COME FROM?

313
00:18:09,916 --> 00:18:12,625
- ( giggles )

314
00:18:12,708 --> 00:18:16,666
THAT'S A VERY PRETTY PENDANT.

315
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:19,625
- IT'S-- 
- IS IT A TREASURE?

316
00:18:19,708 --> 00:18:21,291
- NO, NOT EXACTLY.

317
00:18:21,375 --> 00:18:23,666
- THEN CAN I HAVE IT?

318
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:25,875
- HEY!  COME BACK.

319
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:34,416
- TELL ME,
WHY DID THE PROXY DIE?

320
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:37,250
- BECAUSE ITS SUPPOSEDLY
INDESTRUCTIBLE AMRITA CELLS

321
00:18:37,333 --> 00:18:39,916
WERE DESTROYED. 
- WHAT WAS THE REASON?

322
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,416
- UNFORTUNATELY,
YOU TOOK MY TOY FROM ME

323
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,208
BEFORE I WAS ABLE
TO LEARN THAT.

324
00:18:44,291 --> 00:18:46,333
- I GUESS THAT WAS HARSH.

325
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:50,000
I'LL PROVE HOW SORRY I AM
BY LENDING YOU MY TOY.

326
00:18:50,083 --> 00:18:51,666
YOU CAN PLAY WITH IT
AS YOU LIKE,

327
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:54,583
BUT ONLY UNDER THE CAREFUL
GUIDANCE AND SUPERVISION

328
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:58,375
OF AN ADULT LIKE MYSELF
WHO KNOWS RIGHT FROM WRONG.

329
00:18:58,458 --> 00:19:01,000
- BECAUSE IT'S A TOY
FOR ADULTS?

330
00:19:01,083 --> 00:19:03,125
- THAT'S A GOOD BOY.

331
00:19:09,625 --> 00:19:11,541
- ( girl panting )

332
00:19:16,125 --> 00:19:18,458
LET'S PLAY TOGETHER
FROM NOW ON!

333
00:19:18,541 --> 00:19:21,541
- Re-l: I CAN'T.

334
00:19:21,625 --> 00:19:22,708
- WHY NOT?

335
00:19:22,791 --> 00:19:25,041
THIS IS SUCH A GREAT PLACE.

336
00:19:25,125 --> 00:19:27,708
- YOU'RE RIGHT.

337
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:32,416
UNFORTUNATELY,
THERE'S SOMEONE I HAVE TO MEET.

338
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:33,791
- ARE YOU AFRAID?

339
00:19:33,875 --> 00:19:36,875
YOU REALLY DON'T WANT
TO MEET HIM?

340
00:19:36,958 --> 00:19:39,083
EVEN IF YOU'RE ABLE
TO MEET HIM,

341
00:19:39,166 --> 00:19:41,541
YOU MIGHT END UP JUST
STANDING THERE

342
00:19:41,625 --> 00:19:43,916
PARALYZED BY YOUR OWN FEARS.

343
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,583
YOU MIGHT NOT BE ABLE
TO GO BACK

344
00:19:46,666 --> 00:19:48,583
TO THE WAY IT WAS BEFORE.

345
00:19:48,666 --> 00:19:52,375
THE THING THAT YOU SEEK
MIGHT BE SOMETHING CRUEL.

346
00:19:54,916 --> 00:19:56,708
AND YOU STILL WANT TO GO.

347
00:19:56,791 --> 00:19:59,458
- BECAUSE THE TRUTH

348
00:19:59,541 --> 00:20:03,666
IS IN HIS HANDS.

349
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:19,458
- FOR GOOD LUCK.

350
00:20:19,541 --> 00:20:21,416
( blows )

351
00:20:35,041 --> 00:20:37,458
- Raul: YOU'LL PROBABLY
TAKE THIS THE WRONG WAY,

352
00:20:37,541 --> 00:20:40,458
BUT I'LL SAY IT ANYHOW--
I WANT TO SAVE THE WORLD.

353
00:20:40,541 --> 00:20:44,291
- THAT'S SO TOUCHING
I'M ABOUT TO CRY.

354
00:20:44,375 --> 00:20:45,791
( grunts )

355
00:20:45,875 --> 00:20:48,291
- IT SEEMS YOU HAVEN'T
BEEN PROPERLY TRAINED.

356
00:20:48,375 --> 00:20:51,541
SORRY, BUT I'M NOT AS LENIENT
AS THE REGENT.

357
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:54,000
I CAN BEHAVE
IN A MOST UNPLEASANT WAY

358
00:20:54,083 --> 00:20:57,666
WHEN NECESSARY,
DAEDALUS YUMENO.

359
00:21:01,083 --> 00:21:05,041
( chuckles )

360
00:21:05,125 --> 00:21:07,625
NOW YOU'RE FREE
TO DELVE INTO THE RESEARCH

361
00:21:07,708 --> 00:21:10,250
YOU LOVE SO MUCH,
EXCEPT YOU'LL BE DOING IT

362
00:21:10,333 --> 00:21:12,750
JUST FOR ME.

363
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:17,833
- ( beeps ) 
- DID YOU FIND IT?

364
00:21:17,916 --> 00:21:19,916
- Kristeva:
Not as of yet.

365
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,333
- IF YOU HAVEN'T
FOUND THE DATA BY NOW,

366
00:21:22,416 --> 00:21:24,791
IT PROBABLY MEANS
IT'S NOT HERE, RIGHT?

367
00:21:24,875 --> 00:21:27,833
- HOW DID YOU RESOLVE THINGS
WITH DAEDALUS YUMENO?

368
00:21:27,916 --> 00:21:29,916
- I'M RESTORING HIM
TO ACTIVE DUTY.

369
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,958
I'M GOING TO HAVE HIM
CARRY OUT HIS DUTIES

370
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:34,458
UNDER MY SUPERVISION
FROM NOW ON.

371
00:21:34,541 --> 00:21:37,791
IT TOOK SOME TIME AND EFFORT
TO BRING HIM AROUND,

372
00:21:37,875 --> 00:21:39,375
BUT I THINK THAT THE EXPERIENCE

373
00:21:39,458 --> 00:21:41,541
WILL PROVE
VERY EDUCATIONAL FOR HIM.

374
00:21:41,625 --> 00:21:45,291
AS THEY SAY,
JUSTICE IS FOR THE STRONG.

375
00:21:47,083 --> 00:21:50,041
- WELCOME HOME.
I'M SO HAPPY YOU'RE BACK.

376
00:21:50,125 --> 00:21:52,208
( chuckling )

377
00:21:52,291 --> 00:21:54,875
YOU FOOL.

378
00:21:54,958 --> 00:21:57,375
YOU THINK MY RESEARCH
IS FOR YOU?

379
00:21:57,458 --> 00:22:00,041
YOU DON'T HAVE
THE SLIGHTEST CLUE.

380
00:22:00,125 --> 00:22:03,666
THIS IS ALL FOR YOU, RE-L,
MY RE-L.

381
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:05,625
RE-L.

382
00:22:07,291 --> 00:22:08,791
RE-L.

383
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:13,250
Iggy:
RE-L?  RE-L?

384
00:22:15,458 --> 00:22:18,208
RE-L?  RE-L?!

385
00:22:20,208 --> 00:22:21,416
- IGGY?

386
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:24,291
- WHAT WERE DOING
RUNNING OFF LIKE THAT?

387
00:22:24,375 --> 00:22:26,625
I WAS LOOKING ALL OVER
FOR YOU.

388
00:22:29,833 --> 00:22:32,500
WHAT?
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

389
00:22:32,583 --> 00:22:36,291
HEY, ARE YOU SURE
YOU'RE OKAY?

390
00:22:36,375 --> 00:22:38,333
- IT WAS NOTHING,

391
00:22:38,416 --> 00:22:40,666
JUST A DREAM.

392
00:22:55,458 --> 00:22:58,333
- ( whirring )

393
00:22:58,416 --> 00:23:01,125
- Daedalus: I DON'T HAVE TO
SNEAK AROUND ANYMORE.

394
00:23:03,416 --> 00:23:07,125
THIS IS WHAT TWO MINUTES
AND 17 SECONDS GETS YOU.

395
00:23:07,208 --> 00:23:09,291
- ( beeping )

396
00:23:19,708 --> 00:23:22,291
- THIS AMOUNT
SHOULD BE MORE THAN ENOUGH.

397
00:23:33,833 --> 00:23:37,375
- Re-l: THE ONLY THING LEFT
IS TO LOAD IT.

398
00:24:32,583 --> 00:24:35,291
