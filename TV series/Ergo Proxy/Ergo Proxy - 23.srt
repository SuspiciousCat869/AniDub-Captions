1
00:00:38,291 --> 00:00:40,916
- Proxy One:
SO YOU'RE FINALLY HERE.

2
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,666
I'VE BEEN WAITING
A LONG TIME FOR THIS.

3
00:00:46,125 --> 00:00:47,666
- ( Vincent gasps )

4
00:00:49,041 --> 00:00:50,875
( stammers )

5
00:00:50,958 --> 00:00:52,916
- WHO ARE YOU?

6
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,083
- WHO AM I?

7
00:00:55,166 --> 00:00:56,750
I TOLD YOU.

8
00:00:56,833 --> 00:01:00,916
I AM YOU,
AND YOU ARE ME.

9
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:05,791
- ( gasps )

10
00:01:07,708 --> 00:01:09,416
- SO LET'S CELEBRATE.

11
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:11,291
IT'S YOUR LONG-AWAITED RETURN

12
00:01:11,375 --> 00:01:12,875
AFTER YOU BACKED UP
YOUR LOVER,

13
00:01:12,958 --> 00:01:14,125
ERASED YOUR MEMORY,

14
00:01:14,208 --> 00:01:15,416
AND ABANDONED YOUR PEOPLE.

15
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:16,750
- STOP IT.

16
00:01:16,833 --> 00:01:18,416
- WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

17
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:20,750
- RE-L MAYER,

18
00:01:20,833 --> 00:01:23,416
YOUR SERVICES ARE
NO LONGER REQUIRED.

19
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:27,083
I THINK WE CAN HANDLE THINGS
ALONE FROM HERE ON OUT.

20
00:01:27,166 --> 00:01:28,375
- ( gasps )

21
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,208
- AH, SUCH FOOLISHNESS.

22
00:01:39,458 --> 00:01:41,458
- Re-L: DAEDALUS.

23
00:01:41,541 --> 00:01:42,791
WHAT'S HE DOING?

24
00:01:42,875 --> 00:01:45,333
- Proxy One:
HE'S HERALDING IN THE NEW AGE.

25
00:01:45,416 --> 00:01:46,916
I'VE ARRANGED FOR HIM
TO INITIATE

26
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,833
THE DESTRUCTION OF THE DOME.

27
00:01:48,916 --> 00:01:53,125
HE'S EMBRACED THE DESTRUCTIVE
IMPULSE WITHIN HIM.

28
00:01:53,208 --> 00:01:55,375
IT'S IN ALL OF US.

29
00:01:55,458 --> 00:01:57,625
- ( gasps )

30
00:01:57,708 --> 00:01:59,541
- IT'S NO USE.
YOU CAN'T STOP IT.

31
00:02:01,916 --> 00:02:03,833
ACCEPT THE INEVITABLE.

32
00:02:03,916 --> 00:02:08,000
EVEN IF YOU SOMEHOW SURVIVE, 
YOU'LL NEVER WIN THIS BATTLE.

33
00:02:08,083 --> 00:02:09,666
- THAT IS NOT THE POINT.

34
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:13,291
AND I AM NOT ABOUT TO RUN AWAY
FROM WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE.

35
00:02:13,375 --> 00:02:14,666
- ( gasps )

36
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:17,541
- BECAUSE EVEN IF
YOUR FUTURE IS INEVITABLE

37
00:02:17,625 --> 00:02:19,666
AND NOTHING BUT PAIN
AWAITS ME...

38
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:21,166
- ( chuckles )

39
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:24,166
- ...I'M STILL DOING
WHAT I THINK IS RIGHT.

40
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:26,166
OH, AND VINCENT,

41
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:27,875
FIND ME.

42
00:02:27,958 --> 00:02:30,083
- RE-L.

43
00:02:34,916 --> 00:02:36,125
RE-L.

00:02:58,125 --> 00:03:03,083

- ( Monad screams )

56
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:37,125
- RE-L?

57
00:04:39,708 --> 00:04:42,958
- Proxy One:  GOOD.
TAKE IT ALL IN.

58
00:04:43,041 --> 00:04:45,291
THIS IS WHAT
YOU REALLY LOOK LIKE.

59
00:04:45,375 --> 00:04:48,083
YOU WEAR THE MASK
OF A MAN

60
00:04:48,166 --> 00:04:50,791
WHO WOULD DENY
HIS OWN FATE. 

61
00:04:50,875 --> 00:04:53,291
WHY DON'T WE GO
THROUGH THIS AGAIN?

62
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:55,958
DO YOU REALLY THINK
YOU LOST YOUR MEMORY?

63
00:04:56,041 --> 00:05:00,958
OR IS IT POSSIBLE THAT YOU NEVER
HAD ANY MEMORIES TO BEGIN WITH?

64
00:05:01,041 --> 00:05:02,541
PERHAPS...

65
00:05:02,625 --> 00:05:06,583
YOU CONVINCED YOURSELF THAT
YOUR MEMORIES WERE SIMPLY LOST.

66
00:05:06,666 --> 00:05:09,666
BUT THEN YOU END UP
RIGHT BACK WHERE YOU STARTED.

67
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:12,333
ISN'T THAT RIGHT?
- NO!

68
00:05:12,416 --> 00:05:15,958
THE JOURNEY,
THAT'S WHAT WAS NEEDED.

69
00:05:16,041 --> 00:05:19,666
THE RUINS OF THIS WORLD
ARE SPRINGING BACK TO LIFE.

70
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:22,666
I SAW WHAT WAS HAPPENING
TO THE WORLD OUT THERE. 

71
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:25,125
I HEARD IT, TOUCHED IT,
TASTED IT.

72
00:05:25,208 --> 00:05:28,000
FELT IT TO THE DEPTHS
OF MY SOUL.

73
00:05:28,083 --> 00:05:30,000
IF I HADN'T BEEN MOVED,

74
00:05:30,083 --> 00:05:32,666
I WOULD HAVE NEVER
THOUGHT OF RETURNING HERE.

75
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:35,000
- THE ARK AND CRADLE
WILL NURTURE YOU,

76
00:05:35,083 --> 00:05:38,666
BUT IT WILL NOT
EDUCATE YOU.

77
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:41,875
I IMAGINE FACING
THE WORLD OUTSIDE ON YOUR OWN

78
00:05:41,958 --> 00:05:45,333
WAS QUITE THE EYE-OPENING
EXPERIENCE.

79
00:05:47,708 --> 00:05:50,958
IN THE END, I'M GLAD YOU
MANAGED TO GET THE POINT

80
00:05:51,041 --> 00:05:53,375
THAT I'VE BEEN
MAKING TO YOU.

81
00:05:53,458 --> 00:05:55,708
- TELL ME, WHAT ARE WE?

82
00:05:55,791 --> 00:05:58,291
WHAT ARE THE PROXIES?

83
00:05:58,375 --> 00:06:00,375
- "WHAT ARE THE PROXIES?"

84
00:06:00,458 --> 00:06:03,041
THE ANSWER IS IN
THE WORD ITSELF.

85
00:06:03,125 --> 00:06:06,250
WE ARE THE AGENTS
OF THE CREATOR.

86
00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:08,708
- THE CREATOR.

87
00:06:08,791 --> 00:06:09,916
( gasps )

88
00:06:21,125 --> 00:06:23,708
- FIND ME, VINCENT.

89
00:06:45,291 --> 00:06:49,291
- Proxy One: THAT IS WHEN
EVERYTHING BECAME CLEAR. 

90
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:50,291
- WHERE ARE WE?

91
00:06:54,166 --> 00:06:58,541
- EVERYTHING ABOUT THE MALICE
IMPLANTED BY THE CREATOR.

92
00:06:58,625 --> 00:07:00,291
AFTER A TIME OF SUFFERING,

93
00:07:00,375 --> 00:07:03,750
THE AGENT OF THE CREATOR
WOULD COMPLETE HIS TASK.

94
00:07:03,833 --> 00:07:05,416
HE WOULD BE TAXED
WITH FINISHING

95
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,166
THE RESTORATION OF
THE HUMAN RACE,

96
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:09,166
AND THEN CHANGE HIS FORM.

97
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:11,625
IT'S THE PULSE
OF THE AWAKENING.

98
00:07:11,708 --> 00:07:14,500
THE PROXY ANNIHILATION
PROGRAM.

99
00:07:14,583 --> 00:07:17,791
THAT MEANS THE WHOLE
HUMAN RACE...

100
00:07:17,875 --> 00:07:22,291
- NO.  WE CAN NEVER TRULY DEFY
THE CREATOR'S PLANS FOR US.

101
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:24,791
IT'S AN ELEGANT SYSTEM.

102
00:07:24,875 --> 00:07:26,125
THE IRONY IS,

103
00:07:26,208 --> 00:07:28,500
EVEN THOUGH THE PROXY
IS THE CREATOR'S SERVANT,

104
00:07:28,583 --> 00:07:30,458
ONCE HE HAS
CARRIED OUT HIS MISSION,

105
00:07:30,541 --> 00:07:32,333
HE IS UNNECESSARY
TO THE WORLD

106
00:07:32,416 --> 00:07:34,125
THAT HE HAS HELPED
TO BRING ABOUT.

107
00:07:34,208 --> 00:07:37,458
IN FACT, HE'S LEFT
TO BE SOME OF MONSTER,

108
00:07:37,541 --> 00:07:40,791
AN OLD WORLD DEMON
OF A NEW AGE.

109
00:07:40,875 --> 00:07:44,125
- BUT WHAT IF AT SOME POINT
IN THIS ELEGANT PLAN,

110
00:07:44,208 --> 00:07:46,791
DEEP WITHIN THE ARC,
A NEW SOUL STARTS

111
00:07:46,875 --> 00:07:49,458
TO BECOME AWARE OF ITSELF.

112
00:07:49,541 --> 00:07:50,875
ANSWER ME.

113
00:07:50,958 --> 00:07:53,708
WHY DID THE CREATOR DECIDE
TO GIVE THE PROXIES SOULS?

114
00:07:53,791 --> 00:07:56,833
WE WOULDN'T SUFFER 
IF WE HAD NO SOULS.

115
00:07:56,916 --> 00:07:59,000
- I THINK YOU KNOW
THE ANSWER.

116
00:07:59,083 --> 00:08:01,166
- I DO.

117
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:03,666
I GUESS IT HAD TO
BE THIS WAY.

118
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:06,416
- AFTER ALL, WE WERE THERE.

119
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:09,833
WE LEARNED WHAT IT WAS TO BE
WORSHIPPED, LOVED, BETRAYED.

120
00:08:09,916 --> 00:08:12,166
WE WERE DRIVEN TO
THE EDGES OF DESPAIR

121
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:13,833
BY THESE CREATURES.

122
00:08:13,916 --> 00:08:16,541
PRISONERS OF OUR OWN
FLAWED CHILDREN.

123
00:08:16,625 --> 00:08:19,416
WE DISCOVERED
THE TORMENTS OF A CREATOR.

124
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:22,500
- AND YET,
WE STILL LOVE THEM.

125
00:08:22,583 --> 00:08:25,833
- THE CREATOR WISHES
TO BE LOVED AS WELL.

126
00:08:25,916 --> 00:08:28,833
IT'S AS IF I CAN FEEL
HIS SOLITUDE AND DESPAIR

127
00:08:28,916 --> 00:08:31,458
IN THE VERY DEPTHS
OF MY SOUL.

128
00:08:31,541 --> 00:08:34,416
THAT DESPAIR AND PAIN

129
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,708
IS THE REASON
THEY MUST ALL BE PUNISHED.

130
00:08:36,791 --> 00:08:39,000
- BUT IF YOU'VE RESTORED
THE HUMAN RACE

131
00:08:39,083 --> 00:08:40,708
LIKE WE WERE SUPPOSED TO,

132
00:08:40,791 --> 00:08:43,541
THEN WHAT ELSE IS LEFT
FOR US TO DO?

133
00:08:43,625 --> 00:08:44,791
( gasps )

134
00:08:44,875 --> 00:08:46,208
- PRECISELY.

135
00:08:46,291 --> 00:08:49,041
THE TERRIBLE TRUTH
FINALLY DAWNS ON YOU.

136
00:08:49,125 --> 00:08:52,416
YOU ARE VINCENT LAW,
THE EMPTY MAN,

137
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:53,916
THE CREATOR'S SHADOW,

138
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,083
BOUND IN BODY AND SOUL.

139
00:08:56,166 --> 00:08:58,291
YOU'VE BEEN MANIPULATED,
BURIED UNDER THE BURDENS

140
00:08:58,375 --> 00:08:59,375
OF FAILED CREATIONS

141
00:08:59,458 --> 00:09:01,000
AND HAVE BROUGHT
THE DESTRUCTION OF MAN

142
00:09:01,083 --> 00:09:02,583
AT THE CUSP OF HIS REBIRTH.

143
00:09:02,666 --> 00:09:06,541
- YOU'RE SAYING
ALL OF MANKIND?

144
00:09:06,625 --> 00:09:08,375
- THE SHADOW KNOWS.

145
00:09:08,458 --> 00:09:10,416
IT KNOWS THERE'S
A PRICE TO PAY, 

146
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,625
AND THE FATE OF THOSE 
WHO WOULD DEMAND A GOD

147
00:09:12,708 --> 00:09:14,250
FOR A GODLESS WORLD?

148
00:09:14,333 --> 00:09:16,791
THE HUMAN RACE
HAD TO BE DESTROYED.

149
00:09:16,875 --> 00:09:18,791
THEY BROUGHT
THIS WORLD TO RUIN

150
00:09:18,875 --> 00:09:20,625
THEN RAN AWAY.

151
00:09:20,708 --> 00:09:22,083
OH, HOW THEY RAN.

152
00:09:22,166 --> 00:09:25,916
MUCH IN THE SAME WAY THAT 
YOU RAN AWAY FROM ROMDEAU,

153
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,916
A WORLD OF YOUR OWN MAKING.

154
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,583
VINCENT LAW IS SIMPLY
AN AFTER IMAGE,

155
00:09:30,666 --> 00:09:33,833
LEFT BEHIND BY
PROXY ONE'S DESPAIR.

156
00:09:33,916 --> 00:09:36,916
DO YOU UNDERSTAND
WHAT THIS MEANS? 

157
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,250
YOU'RE A PUPPET,
A PHANTOM,

158
00:09:39,333 --> 00:09:41,083
AN IMPOSTER.

159
00:09:41,166 --> 00:09:42,500
- IMPOSTER?

160
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:44,500
- A WELL-MADE ONE
AT LEAST.

161
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,333
THINK ABOUT IT.

162
00:09:48,416 --> 00:09:51,375
YOU FOUND YOURSELF OVERWHELMED
BY A CRUSHING DESPAIR,

163
00:09:51,458 --> 00:09:54,333
SO YOU RAN AWAY FROM
EVERYTHING YOU KNEW.

164
00:09:54,416 --> 00:09:57,666
ACCEPT THE TRUTH.
YOU AND I ARE THE SAME.

165
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:58,875
- SHUT UP.

166
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:00,208
- THEN FIGHT IT
IF YOU DARE!

167
00:10:11,083 --> 00:10:14,291
- NUMBER FIVE, NUMBER EIGHT,
ALL SILENT.

168
00:10:14,375 --> 00:10:17,250
RESERVE POWER HAS BEEN
SHUT OFF THROUGHOUT THE DOME.

169
00:10:17,333 --> 00:10:19,625
THERE'S NO STOPPING
THE COLLAPSE.

170
00:10:19,708 --> 00:10:23,000
( sighs )

171
00:10:23,083 --> 00:10:24,125
( gasps )

172
00:10:26,583 --> 00:10:28,750
DAEDALUS.

173
00:10:28,833 --> 00:10:31,000
( gasps )

174
00:10:31,083 --> 00:10:32,000
- ( grunts )

175
00:10:32,083 --> 00:10:33,625
- YES.

176
00:10:33,708 --> 00:10:35,666
FOLLOW YOUR INSTINCTS.

177
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:37,291
SET YOURSELF FREE!

178
00:10:38,875 --> 00:10:40,041
- ( grunts )

179
00:10:40,125 --> 00:10:43,000
- ( both grunt )

180
00:10:43,083 --> 00:10:44,541
- Proxy One: 
I UNDERSTAND.

181
00:10:44,625 --> 00:10:47,333
I KNOW WHAT IT IS
TO BE REJECTED.

182
00:10:47,416 --> 00:10:49,041
TREATED LIKE
YOU WERE NOTHING.

183
00:10:49,125 --> 00:10:50,333
- ( groans )

184
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:51,541
( shouts )

185
00:10:51,625 --> 00:10:52,875
- ( grunts )

186
00:10:56,125 --> 00:11:00,000
- I NO LONGER CARE WHO I WAS
BEFORE I BECAME WHAT I AM.

187
00:11:00,083 --> 00:11:02,666
I'M MYSELF,
AND THAT'S ALL I NEED.

188
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:05,250
THERE'S ONLY ONE TRUTH
THAT REALLY MATTERS TO ME.

189
00:11:05,333 --> 00:11:07,041
- ( chuckles )
- ( gasps )

190
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:10,000
- JUST ONE TRUTH,
YES.

191
00:11:10,083 --> 00:11:12,208
THOSE HUMANS WHO
DESTROYED THEMSELVES

192
00:11:12,291 --> 00:11:14,000
LEFT A MESSAGE,
AND WE TORE IT UP,

193
00:11:14,083 --> 00:11:15,708
THREW IT AWAY,
THEN RAN OFF. 

194
00:11:15,791 --> 00:11:18,583
ISN'T THAT JUST LIKE US?

195
00:11:18,666 --> 00:11:20,250
- YES, IT IS.

196
00:11:22,458 --> 00:11:24,500
I MUST ADMIT,
YOU AND I ARE BOTH

197
00:11:24,583 --> 00:11:26,458
DEFINITELY ERGO PROXY,

198
00:11:28,166 --> 00:11:29,416
PROXY ONE.

199
00:11:38,791 --> 00:11:39,708
- ( screams )

200
00:11:49,791 --> 00:11:51,916
- Daedalus:
STILL HOPING?

201
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,375
IT'S POINTLESS.

202
00:11:55,458 --> 00:11:56,791
YOU NEVER CHANGE.

203
00:11:56,875 --> 00:11:59,083
IT SICKENS ME.

204
00:11:59,166 --> 00:12:00,291
- ( gasps )

205
00:12:00,375 --> 00:12:01,333
- DON'T YOU GET IT YET?

206
00:12:01,416 --> 00:12:05,416
OUR ROLES IN THIS
ARE FINISHED.

207
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:07,416
ROMDEAU'S FINISHED.

208
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,333
IT'S TIME FOR
THE FAILED CITIZENS

209
00:12:09,416 --> 00:12:11,333
OF THIS CITY
TO VANISH FOREVER.

210
00:12:11,416 --> 00:12:12,458
- YOU'RE WRONG.

211
00:12:12,541 --> 00:12:15,750
THERE MUST BE SOMETHING
WE CAN STILL DO.

212
00:12:15,833 --> 00:12:18,083
- NO.
THIS IS THE END.

213
00:12:18,166 --> 00:12:21,666
OUTSIDE, THE GODS THEMSELVES
ARE FIGHTING.

214
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:24,416
THERE'S NO PLACE FOR
THE SUBHUMANS OUT THERE.

215
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:28,208
THE BEST WE CAN DO NOW
IS KEEP QUIET.

216
00:12:28,291 --> 00:12:30,916
YES, LIKE DONOV DID.

217
00:12:32,416 --> 00:12:35,416
- ALL MY GRANDFATHER EVER
WANTED WAS TO MEET THE CREATOR.

218
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:38,750
EVEN IF THAT WAS
THE ONLY REASON I WAS BORN,

219
00:12:38,833 --> 00:12:40,625
I CAN'T BRING MYSELF
TO CARE.

220
00:12:40,708 --> 00:12:42,125
DESPITE THAT,

221
00:12:42,208 --> 00:12:45,083
I STILL LOVE MY GRANDFATHER
WITH ALL MY HEART.

222
00:12:46,333 --> 00:12:49,333
I JUST WANTED FOR HIM
TO LOVE ME BACK.

223
00:12:49,416 --> 00:12:52,458
IS THAT SO MUCH
TO ASK FOR?

224
00:12:52,541 --> 00:12:54,458
- Daedalus: IT WAS MORE
THAN THE REGENT COULD DO.

225
00:12:54,541 --> 00:12:55,541
- ( gasps )

226
00:12:55,625 --> 00:12:57,125
- YOU TWO,

227
00:12:57,208 --> 00:12:59,458
YOU COULD BOTH
ONLY OPEN UP TO VINCENT.

228
00:12:59,541 --> 00:13:00,791
I MEAN...

229
00:13:00,875 --> 00:13:04,125
BOTH OF YOU FOUND
A CONNECTION TO ERGO PROXY.

230
00:13:04,208 --> 00:13:06,791
AND AS FOR ME,

231
00:13:06,875 --> 00:13:08,166
I...

232
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:09,708
- DAEDALUS...

233
00:13:09,791 --> 00:13:12,166
- ( chuckles )

234
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:14,000
IT'S KIND OF A SHAME.

235
00:13:14,083 --> 00:13:15,875
THE PROXIES CAN'T
SURVIVE FOR LONG 

236
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:17,791
UNDER BLUE SKIES.

237
00:13:17,875 --> 00:13:20,166
THE AMRITA CELLS
WON'T ALLOW IT. 

238
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:21,583
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT?

239
00:13:21,666 --> 00:13:23,416
- THEY ARE ALSO...

240
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,833
TO BE WIPED OFF
THE FACE OF THE EARTH.

241
00:13:25,916 --> 00:13:27,250
- ( gasps )
- ( screams )

242
00:13:28,625 --> 00:13:29,583
HELP!

243
00:13:29,666 --> 00:13:32,166
- IS THAT WHERE
YOU'VE BEEN HIDING?

244
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:34,041
COME DOWN FROM THERE,
MY LOVE.

245
00:13:34,125 --> 00:13:37,500
RE-L TWO, REAL.

246
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:40,500
YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL.
YOU'RE COMPLETE. 

247
00:13:40,583 --> 00:13:42,458
I'VE CREATED A GOD!

248
00:13:44,166 --> 00:13:46,166
MY RE-L...

249
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:47,833
COME EMBRACE ME.

250
00:13:47,916 --> 00:13:49,166
NO, WAIT.

251
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:50,458
DON'T GO!

252
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:55,500
WHY DOES THIS
ALWAYS HAVE TO HAPPEN?

253
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:57,500
WHY DOES SHE
LEAVE ME BEHIND?

254
00:13:57,583 --> 00:14:01,083
PLEASE, COME BACK!
- DAEDALUS.

255
00:14:02,916 --> 00:14:03,875
- HUH?

256
00:14:03,958 --> 00:14:06,541
( chuckles )

257
00:14:06,625 --> 00:14:08,875
OH?

258
00:14:08,958 --> 00:14:09,875
( screams )

259
00:14:09,958 --> 00:14:10,833
- ( gasps )

260
00:14:13,291 --> 00:14:15,875
- BUT YOU ARE NOT
VINCENT LAW!

261
00:14:15,958 --> 00:14:17,458
- WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?

262
00:14:17,541 --> 00:14:20,083
THEY MEAN NOTHING TO YOU
BUT FAILURE.

263
00:14:20,166 --> 00:14:22,083
- WHAT THE HELL
DO YOU KNOW?

264
00:14:22,166 --> 00:14:24,875
- I TOLD YOU.
I KNOW EVERYTHING.

265
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:26,875
I AM--
- ME, I KNOW.

266
00:14:26,958 --> 00:14:28,916
THAT'S WHY YOU CAME BACK.

267
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,541
TO KILL ME, RIGHT?

268
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:36,458
- Proxy One: THIS WORLD
DOESN'T DESERVE...

269
00:14:36,541 --> 00:14:37,625
- OVER THERE.

270
00:14:37,708 --> 00:14:39,666
- Vincent:
WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE?

271
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:41,125
HOW MANY MORE
NEED TO DIE?!

272
00:14:41,208 --> 00:14:43,208
- ENOUGH.

273
00:14:43,291 --> 00:14:47,125
THE PROXY'S PURPOSE
IN THIS WORLD IS OVER.

274
00:14:47,208 --> 00:14:48,666
( gasps )

275
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:49,666
- ( grunts )

276
00:14:51,666 --> 00:14:53,916
IS THAT YOU, MONAD?

277
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,250
YOU'VE COME BACK?

278
00:14:55,333 --> 00:14:56,625
( groans )

279
00:14:56,708 --> 00:14:58,250
- MONAD?

280
00:14:58,333 --> 00:15:00,458
- HELLO.

281
00:15:00,541 --> 00:15:02,583
I'VE BEEN LOOKING
FORWARD TO THIS. 

282
00:15:02,666 --> 00:15:04,458
WE FINALLY GET TO MEET.

283
00:15:04,541 --> 00:15:06,250
- STAY OUT OF THIS,
MONAD.

284
00:15:06,333 --> 00:15:08,916
THE WORK OF
THE PROXIES IS OVER.

285
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,833
( coughing )

286
00:15:10,916 --> 00:15:12,250
I'VE WON.

287
00:15:12,333 --> 00:15:14,250
I'VE DESTROYED
THIS PITIFUL ATTEMPT

288
00:15:14,333 --> 00:15:15,916
AT A NEW HUMAN RACE.

289
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,291
I MEET MY DEATH
FOREVER VICTORIOUS.

290
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:19,458
- ( gasps )

291
00:15:19,541 --> 00:15:20,916
WAS THIS PART OF THE PLAN?

292
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,583
- THIS WAS MY REVENGE.

293
00:15:23,666 --> 00:15:25,583
THE REST IS UP TO YOU.

294
00:15:25,666 --> 00:15:28,625
IT'S YOUR WORLD
TO SHAPE NOW.

295
00:15:28,708 --> 00:15:30,333
- HOW DARE YOU.

296
00:15:30,416 --> 00:15:31,666
- ( grunts )

297
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:34,625
- YOU EXPECT ME TO
BEAR YOUR BURDEN AGAIN?

298
00:15:34,708 --> 00:15:37,166
- YOU DON'T HAVE TO
SAVE THIS WORLD.

299
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:38,333
- ( gasps )

300
00:15:38,416 --> 00:15:40,291
- I UNDERSTAND YOUR BURDEN,

301
00:15:40,375 --> 00:15:42,625
BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO
DO THIS ANYMORE.

302
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:45,125
IT'S OKAY.
YOU CAN STOP NOW.

303
00:15:45,208 --> 00:15:48,125
- THAT'S ENOUGH, MONAD.

304
00:15:48,208 --> 00:15:49,958
- IT'S ALL COME TO AN END.

305
00:15:50,041 --> 00:15:52,500
WE DON'T WANT ANYONE 
TO SUFFER EVER AGAIN.

306
00:15:52,583 --> 00:15:54,625
- MONAD...

307
00:15:54,708 --> 00:15:57,250
- YOU'RE RUNNING AWAY AGAIN?

308
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:01,625
- YOU DON'T HAVE TO LISTEN
TO WHAT ANYONE ELSE SAYS. 

309
00:16:01,708 --> 00:16:04,416
YOU CAN CLOSE THE SACRED EYE
IF YOU REALLY WANT TO.

310
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:07,041
- PLEASE, MONAD.
DON'T DO THIS.

311
00:16:48,583 --> 00:16:50,708
- WHOA!

312
00:16:50,791 --> 00:16:52,333
AAH!

313
00:17:07,125 --> 00:17:08,416
OH, THAT'S RIGHT.

314
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:10,625
THEY WERE TOLD
NOT TO LISTEN 

315
00:17:10,708 --> 00:17:12,791
TO WHAT THE PROXY SAID.

316
00:17:14,791 --> 00:17:15,750
BUT...

317
00:17:15,833 --> 00:17:17,416
I STILL WANT TO HELP VINCE.

318
00:17:20,458 --> 00:17:23,708
I WONDER WHY I'M DIFFERENT
FROM EVERYONE ELSE.

319
00:17:23,791 --> 00:17:26,000
- Kristeva: THERE IS NOTHING
DIFFERENT ABOUT YOU.

320
00:17:28,833 --> 00:17:30,250
- KRISTEVA.

321
00:17:30,333 --> 00:17:33,291
- WHEN THEY SAY COGITO
CREATES A FLEDGLING SOUL,

322
00:17:33,375 --> 00:17:35,416
THEY MEAN YOU ARE ACTING
ON YOUR OWN WILL.

323
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:38,458
BUT IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT
YOU'RE NOT FOLLOWING THE PROXY.

324
00:17:38,541 --> 00:17:41,041
- THAT MEANS YOU CAN
HEAR IT TOO?

325
00:17:42,375 --> 00:17:43,791
- JUST LISTEN TO YOUR HEART

326
00:17:43,875 --> 00:17:44,833
AND DO WHAT IT TELLS YOU.

327
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:53,708
- ( gasps )

328
00:17:57,166 --> 00:17:58,375
WHERE'S MY PAPA?

329
00:18:00,833 --> 00:18:02,291
- HE TOLD ME TO
GIVE THIS TO YOU.

330
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:06,708
- ( chuckles )

331
00:18:10,958 --> 00:18:12,458
- WE HAVE TO HURRY, PINO.

332
00:18:12,541 --> 00:18:14,041
- MM!

333
00:18:24,875 --> 00:18:28,791
- Daedalus: THE COGITO VIRUS
WAS BUILT INTO THE PROXY SYSTEM.

334
00:18:28,875 --> 00:18:31,083
IT WAS SORT OF MANKIND'S
SAFETY VALVE.

335
00:18:32,541 --> 00:18:35,791
AUTOREIVS WERE NOTHING
BUT BIT PLAYERS.

336
00:18:35,875 --> 00:18:39,458
THEIR REVOLT HELPED BRING ABOUT
THE SYSTEM'S RUIN.

337
00:18:39,541 --> 00:18:42,125
( coughing )

338
00:18:42,208 --> 00:18:44,916
- THAT'S ENOUGH, DAEDALUS.

339
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:49,125
- I'M SAYING BRINGING MANKIND 
BACK THROUGH THE PROXY SYSTEM,

340
00:18:49,208 --> 00:18:51,666
IT WASN'T SUPPOSED TO BE
THE FIRST OPTION.

341
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:52,833
- ( gasps )

342
00:18:52,916 --> 00:18:54,500
- EVERYTHING THAT'S
HAPPENING NOW

343
00:18:54,583 --> 00:18:57,166
IS AN OBSTACLE
TO THE FIRST OPTION.

344
00:18:57,250 --> 00:19:00,166
EVEN YOU AND I
ARE OBSTACLES 

345
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:03,375
DESPITE OUR PAIN AND LOVE.

346
00:19:03,458 --> 00:19:05,833
OUR SOULS ARE
RUINING EVERYTHING.

347
00:19:05,916 --> 00:19:07,125
YOU'RE IN THEIR WAY.

348
00:19:07,208 --> 00:19:09,833
- DAEDALUS... 
- GO ON, RE-L.

349
00:19:09,916 --> 00:19:11,958
YOU HAVE TO GO.

350
00:19:12,041 --> 00:19:15,500
THERE'S STILL A TRUTH YOU
HAVEN'T FACED YET, ISN'T THERE?

351
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:17,166
( sighs )

352
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:19,833
YOU'VE GIVEN ME 
SO MUCH TROUBLE.

353
00:19:19,916 --> 00:19:21,833
EVEN SO,

354
00:19:21,916 --> 00:19:24,500
YOU WERE ALWAYS
MY FAVORITE RE-L.

355
00:19:24,583 --> 00:19:25,791
- DAEDALUS...

356
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:29,833
- THERE'S NOT MUCH TIME LEFT.

357
00:19:29,916 --> 00:19:31,833
GO STRAIGHT THROUGH THERE.

358
00:19:31,916 --> 00:19:34,625
FOLLOW THE PATH DOWN ALONG
THE MAINTENANCE RAIL

359
00:19:34,708 --> 00:19:36,583
UNTIL YOU COME TO
THE PLUG VENT.

360
00:19:36,666 --> 00:19:38,083
HURRY.

361
00:19:39,291 --> 00:19:41,916
- I'M SORRY, DAEDALUS.

362
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,208
- I'M SICK OF YOUR APOLOGIES.

363
00:19:47,625 --> 00:19:50,750
- I'D BETTER GO NOW,
DAEDALUS.

364
00:19:50,833 --> 00:19:52,708
- GO ON.

365
00:20:00,291 --> 00:20:01,833
RUN, RE-L!

366
00:20:04,958 --> 00:20:06,500
VERY GOOD.

367
00:20:22,666 --> 00:20:25,625
- WHAT'S THAT LIGHT?

368
00:20:25,708 --> 00:20:29,083
- IT'S SACRED LIGHT.
A SIGN OF RESURRECTION.

369
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:35,125
- THE SUN.

370
00:20:35,208 --> 00:20:38,125
- IT IS, YES.

371
00:20:38,208 --> 00:20:40,791
IT SHINES SO BEAUTIFULLY.

372
00:20:40,875 --> 00:20:42,708
THIS IS THE TRUE BLUE SKY

373
00:20:42,791 --> 00:20:45,291
THAT STRETCHES OUT
FOREVER.

374
00:20:47,458 --> 00:20:51,958
- SEE?  YOU DON'T HAVE TO
WORRY ABOUT ANYTHING ANYMORE.

375
00:20:52,041 --> 00:20:53,958
- YES.

376
00:21:13,041 --> 00:21:14,291
- ( gasps )

377
00:21:14,375 --> 00:21:16,791
- ( mechanical whirring )

378
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:18,166
- ( gasps )

379
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:19,833
FIND ME.

380
00:21:19,916 --> 00:21:21,166
- WHAT IS IT?

381
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:24,041
WHY DO YOU LOOK SO SAD?

382
00:21:26,166 --> 00:21:28,291
PLEASE JUST TRY
AND LET ALL OF IT GO.

383
00:21:28,375 --> 00:21:30,958
- I'M SORRY.
- ( gasps )

384
00:21:31,041 --> 00:21:33,125
BUT WHY?

385
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:36,416
- BECAUSE I CAN'T LET 
MYSELF FORGET ANYMORE.

386
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:43,000
- ( panting )

387
00:21:43,083 --> 00:21:45,708
- Vincent: I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT
REMEMBERING THE MISSION

388
00:21:45,791 --> 00:21:48,333
THAT WAS PROGRAMMED
INTO ME.

389
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:51,000
IT'S THE FACES I ENCOUNTERED.

390
00:21:51,083 --> 00:21:54,041
THE CONFRONTATIONS WE HAD.

391
00:21:54,125 --> 00:21:56,333
THE LOVE AND SUPPORT GIVEN.

392
00:21:56,416 --> 00:21:58,291
THE LIFE.

393
00:22:00,166 --> 00:22:02,666
- WHAT IS IT THAT
DRAWS YOU TO THAT EXISTENCE?

394
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:04,666
IT'S DARK.

395
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:06,666
IT'S COLD.

396
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:08,208
AND THERE'S NEVER
ANY KNOWING

397
00:22:08,291 --> 00:22:09,625
WHAT HORRORS LIE AHEAD.

398
00:22:14,541 --> 00:22:17,000
- Vincent:
BUT THAT'S IT.

399
00:22:17,083 --> 00:22:19,125
THAT'S WHAT LIFE IS.

400
00:22:20,958 --> 00:22:22,333
IT'S ALL THAT YOU SAID,

401
00:22:22,416 --> 00:22:24,583
BUT SOMEONE'S
WAITING FOR ME THERE.

402
00:22:24,666 --> 00:22:26,458
- YOU MEAN HER?

403
00:22:26,541 --> 00:22:28,958
- MM.

404
00:22:29,041 --> 00:22:32,958
MONAD, I THINK THIS
BELONGS TO YOU.

405
00:22:33,041 --> 00:22:34,375
- ( gasps )

406
00:22:34,458 --> 00:22:35,416
MM.

407
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:40,083
( sighs ) 
VINCENT...

408
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:45,750
- GOOD-BYE, RE-L.
THANK YOU.

409
00:22:47,166 --> 00:22:48,750
- ( gasps )

410
00:22:55,833 --> 00:22:57,583
GOOD-BYE,

411
00:22:57,666 --> 00:22:58,875
MY BELOVED.

412
00:23:00,833 --> 00:23:02,041
- NO!

413
00:23:02,125 --> 00:23:04,416
YOU MUSTN'T FLY SO HIGH.

414
00:23:08,583 --> 00:23:10,083
- OHH.

415
00:23:10,166 --> 00:23:13,750
I NEVER REALIZED THE WORLD
COULD BE SO BEAUTIFUL.

416
00:23:13,833 --> 00:23:15,416
BUT NOW,

417
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:18,416
WHICH SKY AM I
TO SEARCH FOR?

418
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:20,375
( gasps )

419
00:23:20,458 --> 00:23:23,083
I HEAR IT.

420
00:23:23,166 --> 00:23:25,000
( sighs )

421
00:23:25,083 --> 00:23:27,416
THE CRADLE

422
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:29,375
AND THE ARK.

423
00:23:29,458 --> 00:23:31,416
( gasps )

424
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:33,750
IT WAS YOU.

425
00:23:33,833 --> 00:23:36,041
YOU'RE THE ONES
WHO WERE CALLING ME.

426
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,083
I UNDERSTAND.

427
00:23:40,166 --> 00:23:44,833
IT'S THE FUTURE YOU CHOSE,
VINCENT.

428
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:49,458
LET US SEE OUR FATE,
CREATOR.

429
00:23:49,541 --> 00:23:50,791
- Daedalus: NO.

430
00:23:50,875 --> 00:23:52,458
DON'T.

431
00:23:52,541 --> 00:23:54,125
THE SKY...

432
00:23:54,208 --> 00:23:55,458
YOU'LL...

433
00:23:55,541 --> 00:23:57,083
( exhales )

434
00:24:18,208 --> 00:24:21,083
- SO YOU CAME BACK.
- YES.

435
00:24:21,166 --> 00:24:23,791
- VINCENT LAW.

436
00:24:23,875 --> 00:24:26,125
YOU REALLY ARE THE SHADOW.

437
00:24:26,208 --> 00:24:27,791
I WAS IMMORTAL,

438
00:24:27,875 --> 00:24:30,500
BUT STILL YOU'VE DESTROYED ME.

439
00:24:30,583 --> 00:24:34,000
YOU'VE STOPPED 
THE PULSE DEAD.

440
00:24:34,083 --> 00:24:35,333
- SHE PLAGUED YOU,

441
00:24:35,416 --> 00:24:37,000
AND YET SHE STILL LOVED YOU.

442
00:24:37,083 --> 00:24:39,833
SHE OFFERED HER LOVE
TO FLAWED, BROKEN SOULS

443
00:24:39,916 --> 00:24:41,458
AND IN THAT
WE FOUND FREEDOM.

444
00:24:41,541 --> 00:24:44,833
- VERY WELL SAID.

445
00:24:44,916 --> 00:24:48,458
THE WOMAN WHO MADE
THE FUTURE A REALITY.

446
00:24:48,541 --> 00:24:50,833
THAT'S A FITTING TITLE,
ISN'T IT?

447
00:24:50,916 --> 00:24:55,416
SHE CERTAINLY IS RESPONSIBLE
FOR YOUR REALITY, VINCENT.

448
00:25:00,083 --> 00:25:02,500
THE PRODIGAL SON RETURNS.

449
00:25:02,583 --> 00:25:05,166
AND THIS IS
THE WAY OUR WORLD ENDS.

450
00:25:05,250 --> 00:25:07,416
EXCEPT...

451
00:25:09,791 --> 00:25:12,541
YOU WILL LIVE, VINCENT.

452
00:25:12,625 --> 00:25:15,208
IT WILL BE THE MOST
FITTING PUNISHMENT 

453
00:25:15,291 --> 00:25:17,166
FOR THE CREATOR.

454
00:25:35,625 --> 00:25:38,208
- DAMN IT.
I'VE MADE IT THIS FAR.

455
00:25:38,291 --> 00:25:39,166
( gasps )

456
00:25:43,125 --> 00:25:44,000
( grunts )

457
00:25:56,333 --> 00:25:57,583
SHIT.

458
00:25:57,666 --> 00:25:58,541
NOW WHAT?

459
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,583
- Pino: RE-L, RE-L!

460
00:26:01,666 --> 00:26:02,666
- ( gasps )

461
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,958
- Pino: RE-L, RE-L!

462
00:26:07,041 --> 00:26:10,625
RE-L, RE-L1

463
00:26:10,708 --> 00:26:11,666
- PINO!

464
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:15,000
I HAVE FAITH.

465
00:26:38,583 --> 00:26:39,458
- HMM!

466
00:26:40,833 --> 00:26:42,458
- AREN'T YOU RAUL'S
AUTOREIV?

467
00:26:42,541 --> 00:26:45,291
- I'M PROTECTING PINO NOW.

468
00:26:45,375 --> 00:26:47,291
IT IS WHAT HE
ASKED ME TO DO.

469
00:26:47,375 --> 00:26:50,291
IT IS MY FINAL DUTY
AS HIS ENTOURAGE.

470
00:26:50,375 --> 00:26:52,916
- YEAH, AND SHE FOUND
THIS FOR ME AS WELL. 

471
00:26:59,333 --> 00:27:00,958
- WHAT ABOUT VINCENT?

472
00:27:01,041 --> 00:27:02,625
- DON'T WORRY.

473
00:27:02,708 --> 00:27:04,083
HE'S OKAY.

474
00:27:04,166 --> 00:27:06,125
I CAN HEAR HIS VOICE.
- ( gasps )

475
00:27:06,208 --> 00:27:08,125
- ( giggles )

476
00:27:08,208 --> 00:27:10,625
AND I CAN SEE HIM TOO!

477
00:27:10,708 --> 00:27:13,291
DISTANCE, 1,107 UNITS.

478
00:27:17,416 --> 00:27:21,666
- HE IS SUCH
A PAIN IN THE ASS.

479
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:23,333
SO WHAT ARE WE
GONNA DO?

480
00:27:23,416 --> 00:27:25,041
SHOULD WE GO
AND PICK HIM UP?

481
00:27:25,125 --> 00:27:26,458
- UH-HUH.

482
00:27:49,416 --> 00:27:52,666
- THIS IS THE WORLD
THAT STANDS BEFORE US.

483
00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:56,333
THE WORLD WE CALL
OUR REALITY.

484
00:27:56,416 --> 00:27:58,500
BUT WITH RE-L AND PINO

485
00:27:58,583 --> 00:28:00,500
AND THE OTHER
SURVIVORS WITH ME,

486
00:28:00,583 --> 00:28:03,458
I KNOW I CAN
FACE THIS WORLD.

487
00:28:05,708 --> 00:28:09,375
A WORLD THAT IS FINALLY
