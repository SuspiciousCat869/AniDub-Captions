WHERE'S VINCENT?

Re-L:
HE DIDN'T KILL ME.

MAYBE THERE'S STILL
A PART OF VINCENT

37
00:04:01,041 --> 00:04:02,916
THAT HASN'T BEEN LOST.

38
00:04:04,708 --> 00:04:05,958
STILL...

39
00:04:06,041 --> 00:04:08,291
- PERHAPS VINCENT LAW
IS GOING TO KILL

40
00:04:08,375 --> 00:04:09,916
THE BUREAU CHIEF AS WELL.

41
00:04:14,708 --> 00:04:17,083
- WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

42
00:04:17,166 --> 00:04:19,291
- I AM HIS ENTOURAGE.

43
00:04:19,375 --> 00:04:21,666
DESPITE ALL THAT'S HAPPENED,

44
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:23,833
IT IS MY DUTY
TO PROTECT HIM.

- ( gunfire continues )

51
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:01,291
- WHERE ARE YOU, PAPA?

52
00:05:03,458 --> 00:05:05,208
- Re-L: GRANDFATHER,

53
00:05:05,291 --> 00:05:08,708
ROMDEAU HAS FALLEN.

54
00:05:08,791 --> 00:05:11,000
ROMDEAU...

55
00:05:11,083 --> 00:05:12,958
I'VE ALWAYS HATED IT.

56
00:05:20,291 --> 00:05:23,250
IT WAS A CITY 
BUILT ON LIES.

57
00:05:24,458 --> 00:05:25,416
BUT NOW...

58
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,208
IS THIS THE TRUTH?

59
00:05:29,583 --> 00:05:35,041
MAYBE THE TRUTH WAS TOO
TERRIBLE TO EVER BE UNLEASHED.

64
00:05:50,833 --> 00:05:52,750
HELLO, ME.

65
00:05:52,833 --> 00:05:55,083
IT'S NICE TO MEET YOU.

66
00:05:55,166 --> 00:05:56,750
- WHO ARE YOU?

67
00:05:56,833 --> 00:05:59,750
- I'M RE-L MAYER,
OF COURSE.

68
00:05:59,833 --> 00:06:02,750
- NO, I'M RE-L MAYER.

69
00:06:02,833 --> 00:06:06,083
I DON'T KNOW 
WHAT YOU ARE.

70
00:06:06,166 --> 00:06:07,416
STAY BACK.

71
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:08,750
- OHH.

72
00:06:08,833 --> 00:06:11,083
PLEASE, LET'S NOT
FIGHT EACH OTHER.

73
00:06:11,166 --> 00:06:14,750
YOU HELPED VINCENT
REMEMBER MONAD.

74
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:15,791
THAT'S ME.

75
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:18,166
I'M MONAD.

76
00:06:20,541 --> 00:06:23,083
- WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

77
00:06:23,166 --> 00:06:24,416
MONAD?

78
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:27,458
WHAT'S THAT GOT
TO DO WITH ANYTHING?

79
00:06:27,541 --> 00:06:30,458
AND HOW THE HELL DO YOU
KNOW WHO VINCENT IS?

80
00:06:30,541 --> 00:06:32,458
- PLEASE.

81
00:06:32,541 --> 00:06:36,541
THERE'S NO NEED FOR HIM
TO SUFFER ANY LONGER.

82
00:06:36,625 --> 00:06:38,625
I CAN FREE HIM
FROM HIS BURDEN

83
00:06:38,708 --> 00:06:41,250
AS THE CREATOR.

84
00:06:41,333 --> 00:06:43,125
- CREATOR?

85
00:06:43,208 --> 00:06:44,625
- ROMDEAU.

86
00:06:44,708 --> 00:06:47,125
HE CREATED ROMDEAU.
- ( gasps )

87
00:06:47,208 --> 00:06:49,833
- Daedalus:
YOU'VE SAID MORE THAN ENOUGH.

88
00:06:51,791 --> 00:06:53,000
RE-L.

89
00:06:53,083 --> 00:06:55,291
I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR YOU.

90
00:06:55,375 --> 00:06:56,291
- ( sighs )

91
00:06:56,375 --> 00:06:58,125
- DAEDALUS.

92
00:06:58,208 --> 00:07:00,750
- THE REGENT
REALLY IS DEAD.

93
00:07:00,833 --> 00:07:04,458
I GUESS THAT EXPLAINS WHY I WAS
ALLOWED TO ENTER HIS CHAMBERS.

94
00:07:04,541 --> 00:07:07,500
- DID VINCENT REALLY
CREATE THE CITY?

95
00:07:07,583 --> 00:07:09,166
- I DON'T KNOW.

96
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:11,166
YOU SHOULD ASK THEM.

97
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:13,500
NOW THAT THE REGENT'S
FINALLY DEAD,

98
00:07:13,583 --> 00:07:15,291
THESE PITIFUL STONE PUPPETS

99
00:07:15,375 --> 00:07:18,500
NO LONGER HAVE ANY REASON 
TO KEEP THEIR MOUTHS SHUT.

100
00:07:18,583 --> 00:07:20,666
- WHO'S SHE?

101
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:24,500
- DIDN'T I SAY
NOT TO WANDER OFF?

102
00:07:24,583 --> 00:07:27,041
- DAEDALUS, I--

103
00:07:27,125 --> 00:07:28,708
I WANT TO SEE VINCENT.

104
00:07:28,791 --> 00:07:30,041
- ( gasps )

105
00:07:30,125 --> 00:07:32,166
- I NEED...

106
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:34,000
VINCENT.

107
00:07:34,083 --> 00:07:36,500
- YOU TOO?

108
00:07:36,583 --> 00:07:38,166
( gasps )

109
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:39,375
RE-L!

110
00:07:39,458 --> 00:07:40,625
- ( gasps )

111
00:07:40,708 --> 00:07:43,833
- RE-L, GO BACK
TO THE LABORATORY.

112
00:07:43,916 --> 00:07:45,916
- NO MORE GAMES.

113
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,541
I KNOW VINCENT
KILLED GRANDFATHER.

114
00:07:48,625 --> 00:07:50,541
BUT WAS THAT
REALLY VINCENT?

115
00:07:50,625 --> 00:07:52,208
- ( sighs )

116
00:07:52,291 --> 00:07:54,958
- SO WHAT AM I 
SUPPOSED TO DO?

117
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:57,208
IF VINCENT IS
NO LONGER HIMSELF,

118
00:07:57,291 --> 00:07:59,208
THEN I--

119
00:07:59,291 --> 00:08:01,000
PLEASE, DAEDALUS.

120
00:08:01,083 --> 00:08:03,666
WHAT DO YOU THINK I SHOULD--
- I DON'T KNOW!

121
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:05,416
- HE KILLED YOUR
GRANDFATHER, RIGHT?

122
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:08,083
THEN WHY DON'T YOU
JUST KILL HIM?

123
00:08:08,166 --> 00:08:10,541
VINCENT, VINCENT, VINCENT.

124
00:08:10,625 --> 00:08:11,708
I DON'T CARE!

125
00:08:15,291 --> 00:08:16,875
WE'RE DONE.

126
00:08:16,958 --> 00:08:19,208
I HAVE TO GO FIND MY RE-L.

127
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:20,958
- DAEDALUS.

128
00:08:22,958 --> 00:08:24,583
- WHEN I LOOK 
INTO HER EYES,

129
00:08:24,666 --> 00:08:26,250
I WANT TO SEE 
MY REFLECTION.

130
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,916
- ( sighs )

131
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,916
NO MORE LIES.

132
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,583
I WANT YOU TO TELL ME
EVERYTHING YOU KNOW. 

133
00:08:38,666 --> 00:08:40,958
- Lacan:
RE-L.

134
00:08:41,041 --> 00:08:43,083
- Derrida:
THE TRUTH IS...

135
00:08:43,166 --> 00:08:46,250
ROMDEAU IS AT AN END.

136
00:08:46,333 --> 00:08:48,583
- WHAT ABOUT VINCENT?

137
00:08:48,666 --> 00:08:50,750
WHAT ABOUT ERGO PROXY?

138
00:08:50,833 --> 00:08:54,750
DID THEY RETURN HERE
JUST TO WATCH ROMDEAU COLLAPSE?

139
00:08:54,833 --> 00:08:56,416
- Berkeley:
WE CANNOT KNOW THE MIND

140
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,750
OF THE CREATOR.

141
00:08:58,833 --> 00:09:02,416
- DID VINCENT REALLY CREATE
THE ENTIRE CITY OF ROMDEAU?

142
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,250
- Derrida:
HE CREATED THE DOME,

143
00:09:04,333 --> 00:09:07,583
AND THE FIRST HANDFUL
OF FELLOW CITIZENS.

144
00:09:07,666 --> 00:09:10,583
- HE CREATED THE WOMBSYS
AS WELL, DIDN'T HE?

145
00:09:10,666 --> 00:09:13,333
- Lacan: HE DID.

146
00:09:13,416 --> 00:09:15,291
- Re-L: IN MY TRAVELS,

147
00:09:15,375 --> 00:09:18,250
I SAW MANY DOMES IN
THE OUTSIDE WORLD. 

148
00:09:20,041 --> 00:09:23,916
WAS EACH OF THOSE DOMES CREATED
BY THEIR OWN PROXY AS WELL?

149
00:09:26,708 --> 00:09:28,958
SO PROXIES ARE GODS.

150
00:09:29,041 --> 00:09:30,958
- Lacan:
AND ROMDEAU IS A PARADISE

151
00:09:31,041 --> 00:09:33,125
WHOSE GOD HAS FORSAKEN IT.

152
00:09:33,208 --> 00:09:34,625
- FORSAKEN?

153
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:37,291
- Husserl:
ERGO PROXY ABANDONED THIS CITY,

154
00:09:37,375 --> 00:09:40,291
TAKING WITH HIM HIS
DISAPPOINTMENT IN HIMSELF.

155
00:09:40,375 --> 00:09:43,125
- Derrida: DONOV MAYER WAS
LEFT TO RULE IN HIS STEAD.

156
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:44,625
- HE WAS APPOINTED?

157
00:09:44,708 --> 00:09:46,625
BY VINCENT?

158
00:09:46,708 --> 00:09:48,458
BUT IF A PROXY IS OMNIPOTENT,

159
00:09:48,541 --> 00:09:50,541
WHY WOULD HE ABANDON
HIS CREATION?

160
00:09:50,625 --> 00:09:53,291
WHY DID HE LEAVE
THIS WORLD IN CHAOS?

161
00:09:53,375 --> 00:09:57,666
- Berkeley: THERE WERE
LIMITS TO HIS OMNIPOTENCE.

162
00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:00,333
- Derrida:
ERGO WAS A GOD IN ROMDEAU.

163
00:10:00,416 --> 00:10:02,000
THAT IS TRUE.

164
00:10:02,083 --> 00:10:04,875
- Lacan: BUT HE WAS
AN IMPERFECT GOD.

165
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:07,458
- Berkeley:
AND SO HIS CREATIONS, LIKE HIM,

166
00:10:07,541 --> 00:10:09,125
WERE ALSO IMPERFECT.

167
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:13,333
- Husserl:
AND SO GOD ABANDONED US.

168
00:10:13,416 --> 00:10:16,500
LEAVING US TO OUR FATE.

169
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:21,000
- THEN... WHY DID ROMDEAU
DECIDE TO INVADE MOSK?

170
00:10:21,083 --> 00:10:24,333
- Derrida: TO IGNITE THE DYING
EMBERS OF OUR LOST GLORY.

- Lacan:
A MEASURED ACT OF VENGEANCE.

172
00:10:27,083 --> 00:10:29,333
- Derrida:
BUT MONAD STOLE OUR LIGHT,

173
00:10:29,416 --> 00:10:33,666
AND SEALED US IN THIS PLACE
WITH OUR EYES FOREVER CLOSED.

174
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:36,833
- Berkeley: OUR VISION WOULD
NO LONGER BE CAPABLE OF SHINING

175
00:10:36,916 --> 00:10:38,166
UPON THE EARTH.

176

- Husserl:
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

177
00:10:40,125 --> 00:10:42,125
- Lacan:
THE IRONY OF THE CREATOR'S

178
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:43,708
SILENT RETURN TO THE CITY

179
00:10:43,791 --> 00:10:46,625
IS NOT LOST ON US.

180
00:10:46,708 --> 00:10:49,833
- AN IMPERFECT GOD.

181
00:10:49,916 --> 00:10:52,166
DOES THAT MEAN...

182
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:53,208
( gasps )

183
00:10:57,250 --> 00:10:59,041
IT CAN'T BE.

184
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:02,041
THAT MEANS...

185
00:11:02,125 --> 00:11:03,666
WE'RE THE CREATOR'S ANGUISH.

186
00:11:08,791 --> 00:11:11,791
- YOU DON'T HAVE TO
SUFFER ANY LONGER. 

187
00:11:11,875 --> 00:11:14,083
COME TO ME, VINCENT.

188
00:11:17,916 --> 00:11:21,791
I WILL FREE YOU FROM
YOUR CAGE OF MISERY.

189
00:11:33,291 --> 00:11:35,208
- ( panting )

190
00:11:35,291 --> 00:11:37,250
( grunts )

191
00:11:38,833 --> 00:11:39,791
HUH?

192
00:11:41,166 --> 00:11:42,791
RE-L MAYER?

193
00:11:46,083 --> 00:11:47,083
( gasps )

194
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
IMPOSSIBLE.

195
00:11:58,125 --> 00:11:59,083
- ( chuckles )

196
00:12:03,041 --> 00:12:04,625
- ( gasps )

197
00:12:09,541 --> 00:12:10,666
- HERE.

198
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:13,125
- I DID EVERYTHING
YOU ASKED ME TO.

199
00:12:13,208 --> 00:12:14,333
YES.

200
00:12:14,416 --> 00:12:17,583
- DAEDALUS YUMENO.

201
00:12:17,666 --> 00:12:19,625
- I THOUGHT YOU'D
BE DEAD BY NOW. 

202
00:12:19,708 --> 00:12:21,916
YOU'VE EXCEEDED
ALL MY EXPECTATIONS.

203
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,208
I NEED ALL THE F.P. SHELLS.
YOU'LL HAND THEM OVER NOW. 

204
00:12:25,291 --> 00:12:26,458
- BY ALL MEANS.

205
00:12:26,541 --> 00:12:28,291
PLEASE, TAKE AS MANY
AS YOU LIKE.

206
00:12:28,375 --> 00:12:29,791
- WHERE DID YOU HIDE THEM?

207
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:32,000
- YOU KNOW,
I CAN'T REMEMBER.

208
00:12:35,541 --> 00:12:37,791
- ( groans )
- OH, HOLD ON.

209
00:12:37,875 --> 00:12:39,250
I THREW THEM AWAY.

210
00:12:41,166 --> 00:12:43,791
( laughing )

211
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:46,166
- ( sighs )

212
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:47,666
( grunts )

213
00:12:48,791 --> 00:12:50,500
WHY THE HELL
DID YOU DO THAT?

214
00:12:50,583 --> 00:12:52,833
- BECAUSE I DIDN'T
NEED THEM ANYMORE.

215
00:12:52,916 --> 00:12:54,833
- I HAVE TO KILL HIM.

216
00:12:54,916 --> 00:12:57,958
I HAVE TO KILL VINCENT LAW.

217
00:12:58,041 --> 00:12:59,500
- HMM.

218
00:12:59,583 --> 00:13:02,500
AS LONG AS I HAVE RE-L,
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

219
00:13:02,583 --> 00:13:03,583
- ( sighs )

220
00:13:03,666 --> 00:13:05,500
- SO YOU'RE JUST
GOING TO SIT HERE

221
00:13:05,583 --> 00:13:07,416
WAITING FOR THE END 
OF THE WORLD TO COME

222
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,458
WITH THIS CHEAP
KNOCK-OFF RE-L?

223
00:13:09,541 --> 00:13:13,166
- FELLOW CITIZENS,
PLEASE THROW THINGS AWAY.

224
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:15,791
WE DON'T NEED YOU ANYMORE,
CHIEF.

225
00:13:15,875 --> 00:13:17,375
- WHAT?

226
00:13:17,458 --> 00:13:19,958
- I'M SAYING REMOVE YOURSELF 
FROM MY PRESENCE, CHIEF RAUL.

227
00:13:20,041 --> 00:13:21,500
THE SIGHT OF YOU...

228
00:13:21,583 --> 00:13:23,500
IT SICKENS ME.

229
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:26,500
- I'M NOT DONE FIGHTING.

230
00:13:26,583 --> 00:13:29,375
NOR DO I ALLOW
SELF-INDULGENCE.

231
00:13:29,458 --> 00:13:32,500
- SO WHAT?

232
00:13:32,583 --> 00:13:33,750
- ( gunshot )

233
00:13:34,833 --> 00:13:36,750
- ( grunting )

234
00:13:44,541 --> 00:13:45,916
WHAT?

235
00:13:47,958 --> 00:13:48,916
- ( gunfire )

236
00:13:52,125 --> 00:13:53,375
- COME ON.

237
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:55,000
- ( whirring )

238
00:13:55,083 --> 00:13:58,208
- Re-L: ERGO CREATED
THE VINCENT PERSONA 

239
00:13:58,291 --> 00:14:01,625
SO THAT HE COULD FORGET
HE WAS A PROXY.

240
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:03,625
BE SOMEONE ELSE.

241
00:14:06,666 --> 00:14:08,791
- Vincent: YOU SAID YOU
WEREN'T GOING TO SHOOT ME YET.

242
00:14:08,875 --> 00:14:11,750
SO I'M GIVING IT
BACK TO YOU.

243
00:14:12,916 --> 00:14:15,125
WE SHOULD GET GOING, RE-L.

244
00:14:19,916 --> 00:14:22,708
HOW COULD AN IMMIGRANT--

245
00:14:22,791 --> 00:14:24,166
I MEAN,
A MONSTER LIKE ME

246
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:25,166
FEEL THIS WAY?

247
00:14:26,833 --> 00:14:31,250
- Re-L: VINCENT, DID ROMDEAU
KEEP TURNING YOU AWAY?

248
00:14:31,333 --> 00:14:34,583
YOU, ITS VERY CREATOR,

249
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:37,125
BECAUSE DEEP DOWN
YOU WANTED IT THAT WAY?

250
00:14:37,208 --> 00:14:39,791
DID YOU PLAN THIS
FROM THE BEGINNING?

251
00:14:42,666 --> 00:14:44,250
AND IF YOU DID,

252
00:14:44,333 --> 00:14:46,625
IF THIS IS ALL 
BY YOUR DESIGN,

253
00:14:46,708 --> 00:14:49,625
THEN DID YOU FIND ME
THAT FIRST TIME

254
00:14:49,708 --> 00:14:53,500
TO MAKE SURE I WOULD KILL YOU
WHEN ROMDEAU COLLAPSED?

255
00:14:53,583 --> 00:14:57,375
IS THAT THE REASON
I WAS CREATED?

256
00:14:57,458 --> 00:15:00,625
IS THAT WHY YOU WERE
DRAWN TO ME,

257
00:15:00,708 --> 00:15:04,250
AND WHY I WAS UNCONTROLLABLY
DRAWN TO YOU?

258
00:15:07,375 --> 00:15:08,625
( gasps )

259
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:09,958
BUT WHY?

260
00:15:10,041 --> 00:15:11,583
I STILL DON'T UNDERSTAND.

261
00:15:14,375 --> 00:15:16,833
I GUESS IT'S
THE SAME THING FOR YOU.

262
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:21,041
NO ONE EVER GETS TO CHOOSE
WHO THEY'RE BORN AS.

263
00:15:24,708 --> 00:15:27,125
NO MATTER WHAT SORT OF
BEING THEY ARE.

264
00:15:27,208 --> 00:15:28,666
( crying )

265
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:30,958
I GUESS THAT'S RIGHT,
VINCENT.

266
00:15:33,416 --> 00:15:35,333
( sighs )

267
00:15:35,416 --> 00:15:37,958
NOW MY HEART FEELS
LIKE IT'S BEING CRUSHED.

268
00:15:39,458 --> 00:15:41,666
EVERYTHING THAT'S BEEN
HOLDING MY LIFE TOGETHER

269
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:43,666
IS LEAVING ME...

270
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:46,250
PIECE BY PIECE.

271
00:15:46,333 --> 00:15:48,333
- Derrida: RE-L.

272
00:15:48,416 --> 00:15:52,166
- Lacan: EVEN IF THIS IS
THE TRUTH FOR ROMDEAU,

273
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:55,333
IT IS NOT THE GREAT TRUTH 
YOU MAY FIND FOR YOURSELF.

274
00:15:58,083 --> 00:16:00,333
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN
"GREAT TRUTH"?

275
00:16:00,416 --> 00:16:03,333
- Berkeley: A TRUTH THAT
CANNOT BE COMMUNICATED. 

276
00:16:03,416 --> 00:16:06,333
IT MUST BE REALIZED.

277
00:16:06,416 --> 00:16:07,791
- Husserl:
FOR ALL CREATURES,

278
00:16:07,875 --> 00:16:10,041
NO MATTER WHO OR
WHAT THEY ARE,

279
00:16:10,125 --> 00:16:12,791
TRUTH MUST BE DERIVED
FROM SELF.

280
00:16:13,958 --> 00:16:16,041
- SO WHAT YOU'RE
TELLING ME IS...

281
00:16:16,125 --> 00:16:19,000
THAT EACH OF US HAS TO
FIND OUR OWN TRUTH.

282
00:16:20,583 --> 00:16:23,750
- Derrida: RE-L, THERE IS
NOTHING ELSE WE CAN SAY TO YOU.

283
00:16:23,833 --> 00:16:26,750
- Husserl: AS LONG AS EVIL
AND SHAME ABIDE...

284
00:16:26,833 --> 00:16:29,833
- Berkeley: IN SILENCE,
WE WILL FIND OUR JOY.

285
00:16:29,916 --> 00:16:32,541
- Derrida:
DO NOT AWAKEN US...

286
00:16:32,625 --> 00:16:34,666
- Lacan:
UNTIL THE END.

287
00:16:36,458 --> 00:16:38,083
- Entourage Statues:
TO REST IN PIECE.

288
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,041
- HUH?

289
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:13,625
( gasps )

290
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:27,291
- PAPA?

291
00:17:33,625 --> 00:17:36,583
- Re-L: MY GREAT TRUTH...

292
00:17:36,666 --> 00:17:38,958
IN THAT MOMENT,

293
00:17:39,041 --> 00:17:42,166
I WAS COMPELLED BY
SOMETHING OTHER THAN FEAR.

294
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:45,125
AND EVERY TIME I'VE COME
FACE TO FACE WITH YOU,

295
00:17:45,208 --> 00:17:47,166
IT'S GROWN STRONGER.

296
00:17:48,541 --> 00:17:50,666
BUT STILL...

297
00:17:58,875 --> 00:18:00,083
- ( gasps )

298
00:18:16,583 --> 00:18:17,458
- ( gasps )

299
00:18:19,125 --> 00:18:22,541
IT FEELS STRANGE.

300
00:18:22,625 --> 00:18:25,541
- YOU DID VERY WELL
PROTECTING ME.

301
00:18:27,041 --> 00:18:29,833
- I DID IT BECAUSE HE SAID
HE WAS GOING TO KILL VINCENT.

302
00:18:29,916 --> 00:18:31,125
- ( gasps )

303
00:18:41,958 --> 00:18:43,875
- ( gasps )

304
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:49,833
- Pino: YOU KNOW WHAT, PAPA?

305
00:18:49,916 --> 00:18:53,125
- Pino: I DISCOVERED THAT
I HAVE LOTS OF FEELINGS. 

306
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:59,208
I FEEL HAPPY AND LONELY.

307
00:18:59,291 --> 00:19:01,833
ALL SORTS OF THINGS.

308
00:19:01,916 --> 00:19:04,791
AND I KEPT GOING FURTHER
AND FURTHER AWAY.

309
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,958
BUT AFTER SPENDING SO MUCH
TIME AWAY FROM YOU, PAPA, 

310
00:19:11,041 --> 00:19:13,333
I STARTED MISSING YOU
SO MUCH.

311
00:19:13,416 --> 00:19:14,875
- ( groans )

312
00:19:14,958 --> 00:19:16,875
- YOU HAVE LOTS 
OF FEELINGS TOO,

313
00:19:16,958 --> 00:19:18,625
DON'T YOU, PAPA?

314
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:20,833
- ( sighs )

315
00:19:22,958 --> 00:19:25,500
PLEASE LET ME SEE HER AGAIN.

316
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:32,458
- Pino: PAPA, I WONDER,

317
00:19:32,541 --> 00:19:33,833
DO YOU MISS ME TOO?

318
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,458
- ( mechanical whirring )

319
00:19:53,208 --> 00:19:55,125
- ( gasps )

320
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,500
- ( gasps )

321
00:20:20,875 --> 00:20:22,125
( gasps )

322
00:21:01,541 --> 00:21:04,416
DONOV MAYER...

323
00:21:08,416 --> 00:21:10,583
- VINCENT.

324
00:21:10,666 --> 00:21:13,416
NO, I MEAN ERGO PROXY.

325
00:21:15,541 --> 00:21:18,000
DID YOU GET
YOUR MEMORY BACK?

326
00:21:18,083 --> 00:21:19,666
- YES.

327
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:22,250
I CREATED THIS CITY.

328
00:21:22,333 --> 00:21:26,666
AND I LEFT EVERYTHING
IN THE CARE OF THIS MAN.

329
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:29,500
- WHY DID YOU RETURN?

330
00:21:29,583 --> 00:21:32,458
YOU KNEW IT WOULD END
WITH MY GUN AT YOUR HEAD.

331
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:34,958
- EXACTLY.

332
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:40,333
DOES THIS MEAN
I'M GOING TO DIE?

333
00:21:40,416 --> 00:21:43,166
- YOU'RE ASKING ME
IF I'LL GO THROUGH WITH IT?

334
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:47,083
- YOU CAN, IF YOU WANT.

335
00:21:54,791 --> 00:21:56,708
WHY?

336
00:21:56,791 --> 00:21:58,708
- YOU DON'T CONTROL ME.

337
00:21:58,791 --> 00:22:02,375
AND I DON'T WANT TO
PLAY YOUR GAMES ANYMORE.

338
00:22:02,458 --> 00:22:04,500
- ( sighs )

339
00:22:04,583 --> 00:22:07,375
- NOW I UNDERSTAND IT.

340
00:22:07,458 --> 00:22:09,458
I KNOW THE TRUTH.

341
00:22:11,125 --> 00:22:13,083
THE MESSAGE THAT WAS
LEFT IN MOSK.

342
00:22:13,166 --> 00:22:15,375
THE TWO PENDANTS.

343
00:22:15,458 --> 00:22:17,708
THAT WHICH IS DIVIDED.

344
00:22:17,791 --> 00:22:21,000
HE'S REVEALED HIMSELF
TO US SO MANY TIMES. 

345
00:22:24,166 --> 00:22:25,708
ARE YOU LISTENING TO ME?

346
00:22:28,083 --> 00:22:31,750
VINCENT LAW AND ERGO PROXY...

347
00:22:31,833 --> 00:22:34,750
THOSE TWO,
WITH THEIR AMNESIA

348
00:22:34,833 --> 00:22:37,416
AND THEIR SPLIT PERSONALITY,

349
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:41,083
THEY WERE THE PERFECT
COVER FOR YOU, WEREN'T THEY?

350
00:22:41,166 --> 00:22:45,083
BUT MY TRUTH FORCED YOU
TO COME UP TO THE SURFACE.

351
00:22:45,166 --> 00:22:47,416
THE THIRD ONE.

352
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:49,333
THE ONE WHO'S BEEN MANIPULATING
THE TWO OF YOU

353
00:22:49,416 --> 00:22:50,958
FROM THE VERY START.

354
00:22:52,875 --> 00:22:54,875
SO SHOW YOURSELF NOW.

355
00:22:54,958 --> 00:22:57,041
I KNOW YOU'RE
LISTENING TO ME.

356
00:22:59,166 --> 00:23:01,583
- ( chuckles )

357
00:23:01,666 --> 00:23:02,541
- ( gasps )

358
00:23:06,875 --> 00:23:12,750
- WELL DONE, RE-L 124C41.

359
00:23:22,208 --> 00:23:24,083
( chuckles )

360
00:23:31,875 --> 00:23:34,666
- NOW IT'S YOUR TURN
TO DISCOVER THE TRUTH.

361
00:23:50,583 --> 00:23:52,458
- ( gasps )

362
00:24:06,583 --> 00:24:08,458
( gasping )

363
00:24:09,708 --> 00:24:12,000
( stammers )

364
00:24:12,083 --> 00:24:14,833
- YOU FINALLY MADE IT.

365
00:24:14,916 --> 00:24:16,833
BUT HOW ARE YOU
SUPPOSED TO FIND YOUR WAY

366
00:24:16,916 --> 00:24:18,958
OUT OF THIS LABYRINTH,

367
00:24:19,041 --> 00:24:21,333
VINCENT LAW?

368
00:24:21,416 --> 00:24:23,416
- ( gasps )

369
00:24:29,291 --> 00:24:31,375

00:26:07,041 --> 00:26:09,625
BUT TREMBLING BENEATH
BLUE SKIES,

WE FIND THE AWAKENED PULSE.
