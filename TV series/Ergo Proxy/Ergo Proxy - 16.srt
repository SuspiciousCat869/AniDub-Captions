1
00:00:35,583 --> 00:00:38,500
- Re-l: A DENSE PREDAWN FOG.

2
00:00:42,833 --> 00:00:45,458
ANOTHER DAY
WITHOUT A GUST OF WIND.

3
00:00:56,041 --> 00:00:57,583
I GET UP AS USUAL.

4
00:01:08,208 --> 00:01:11,583
I TAKE AN HOUR
TO GET READY.

5
00:01:18,916 --> 00:01:21,750
THE MORNING IS SPENT OUTSIDE
WITH THE ENTOURAGE

6
00:01:21,833 --> 00:01:25,083
ASSESSING
THE SITUATION.

7
00:01:29,708 --> 00:01:32,208
I CONFIRM THAT THERE'S NOTHING
WITHIN SIGHT.

8
00:01:32,291 --> 00:01:34,125
- ( shouts )

9
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:40,125
- I CHECK OUR SUPPLY STOCK.

10
00:01:43,125 --> 00:01:46,958
WE NEED TO FIND A WAY OUT
OF HERE.

11
00:01:47,041 --> 00:01:48,916
- ( humming )

12
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:11,583
- RE-L.

13
00:02:11,666 --> 00:02:13,166
- Pino: VINCENT.

14
00:02:14,375 --> 00:02:17,083
VINCENT!

15
00:02:22,583 --> 00:02:32,541
- ( laughs )

16
00:02:32,625 --> 00:02:39,791

30
00:04:13,791 --> 00:04:16,166
- ANOTHER 2,000 MILES TO MOSK.

31
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:19,666
THE CALM OUTSIDE HAS SHOWN
NO SIGN OF LETTING UP.

32
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:23,583
THE ONLY THING THAT STIRS
IN THIS PLACE IS MY PATIENCE.

33
00:04:29,458 --> 00:04:32,291
AND THEN THERE'S THE PROXIES,

34
00:04:32,375 --> 00:04:35,375
A MYSTERY WHICH REFUSES
TO BE SOLVED.

35
00:04:35,458 --> 00:04:38,833
IT IN FACT SEEMS TO DEEPEN
THE FURTHER IN I LOOK.

36
00:04:38,916 --> 00:04:40,625
I DON'T KNOW ANYMORE.

37
00:04:40,708 --> 00:04:43,750
EVEN THE BASE NATURE
OF THEIR POWER IS UNCLEAR TO ME.

38
00:04:43,833 --> 00:04:46,125
AND THE BIGGEST MYSTERY
OF ALL

39
00:04:46,208 --> 00:04:48,000
IS RIGHT NOW IS LYING
ON THE FLOOR

40
00:04:48,083 --> 00:04:51,708
AT MY FEET.
- ( sneezes )

41
00:04:55,791 --> 00:04:59,208
( yawns )

42
00:04:59,291 --> 00:05:01,208
OH!

43
00:05:05,833 --> 00:05:08,000
AND A VERY GOOD MORNING
TO YOU.

44
00:05:17,375 --> 00:05:19,375
- ( laughs )

45
00:05:25,333 --> 00:05:29,041
- THROUGHOUT THE DAY, I TRY
AND OBSERVE THE PROXIES' HABITS.

46
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:51,208
PATHETIC.

47
00:05:51,291 --> 00:05:53,458
IS LEAVING A TOILET SEAT UP

48
00:05:53,541 --> 00:05:56,625
THE ONLY WAY FOR A MAN
TO ASSERT HIS MASCULINITY?

49
00:05:57,916 --> 00:05:59,208
VINCENT!

50
00:05:59,291 --> 00:06:02,208
- ( playing tune )
- Re-l: I DON'T BELIEVE IT.

51
00:06:02,291 --> 00:06:03,583
HOW MANY TIMES DO I HAVE TO
REMIND YOU

52
00:06:03,666 --> 00:06:05,583
TO LOWER THE TOILET SEAT
WHEN YOU'RE DONE?

53
00:06:05,666 --> 00:06:08,666
- I KNOW.  I HEARD YOU.
- NO, YOU DIDN'T.

54
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:15,916
IN MY SPARE TIME,
I OBSERVE THE INFECTED AUTOREIV.

55
00:06:35,541 --> 00:06:37,916
I GET IT.

56
00:06:42,208 --> 00:06:43,875
- HUH?

57
00:06:47,208 --> 00:06:49,500
- Re-l: LIFE IS OFTEN SPOKEN
OF AS A JOURNEY.

58
00:06:49,583 --> 00:06:51,500
"A PINCH OF SALT?"

59
00:06:51,583 --> 00:06:54,458
THOSE DIRECTIONS SOUND STUPID.

60
00:06:54,541 --> 00:06:57,500
SOMETIMES I MAKE DISCOVERIES
IN THIS STRANGE NEW WORLD.

61
00:07:01,875 --> 00:07:04,291
SOMETIMES THERE ARE SURPRISES.

62
00:07:04,375 --> 00:07:06,750
OH, DAMN!

63
00:07:08,583 --> 00:07:11,208
( gasps ) OH, NO!

64
00:07:11,291 --> 00:07:12,666
HOW'D THAT HAPPEN?

65
00:07:15,083 --> 00:07:18,083
WHILE PREPARING LUNCH,
I OBSERVE ANOTHER FACET

66
00:07:18,166 --> 00:07:20,458
OF THE COGITO VIRUS.

67
00:07:20,541 --> 00:07:24,416
ARE YOU LEFT-HANDED, TOO?
- LEFT MY HAND WHERE?

68
00:07:31,541 --> 00:07:33,416
- HMM.

69
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:41,291
AUTOREIVS ARE DESIGNED
TO BE AMBIDEXTROUS.

70
00:07:41,375 --> 00:07:44,750
BUT SHE STILL GOES OUT OF HER
WAY TO USE HER LEFT HAND.

71
00:07:44,833 --> 00:07:47,583
COULD IT BE A SIDE EFFECT
OF HER ASSERTING HER WILL?

72
00:07:47,666 --> 00:07:49,500
- DOES IT TASTE GOOD?

73
00:07:49,583 --> 00:07:52,125
- IT'S STALE.

74
00:07:55,833 --> 00:07:58,375
I PUT THE MYSTERY
OF THE SINISTER AUTOREIV

75
00:07:58,458 --> 00:08:02,125
OFF TILL LATER.

76
00:08:02,208 --> 00:08:03,625
AFTER THINKING IT OVER,

77
00:08:03,708 --> 00:08:05,791
I REALIZE IT'S NOT
THE PROXY,

78
00:08:05,875 --> 00:08:08,958
BUT VINCENT LAW HIMSELF THAT
I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT.

79
00:08:12,458 --> 00:08:15,041
WHAT NOW?

80
00:08:15,125 --> 00:08:17,500
- I REALLY WOULDN'T WORRY
ABOUT IT.

81
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:22,541
- FOUND IT.

82
00:08:22,625 --> 00:08:24,541
( grunting )

83
00:08:28,125 --> 00:08:31,041
( scoffs )

84
00:08:37,541 --> 00:08:40,083
YOUR SOCK HAS A HOLE.

85
00:08:40,166 --> 00:08:43,083
- HUH?

86
00:08:43,166 --> 00:08:45,041
- IT'S NOTHING.
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

87
00:08:47,041 --> 00:08:49,375
- BUT DO I REALLY NEED TO KNOW?

88
00:08:49,458 --> 00:08:51,666
THAT IS THE QUESTION.

89
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:05,083
IN THE AFTERNOON,
A SUPPLY SHORTAGE QUESTION

90
00:09:05,166 --> 00:09:07,791
I'D ANTICIPATED SUDDENLY CAME
TO THE FOREFRONT.

91
00:09:07,875 --> 00:09:11,833
- TWO, ONE.  RE-L,
IT'S BEEN THREE MINUTES NOW.

92
00:09:11,916 --> 00:09:14,625
I'M STILL WASHING MY HAIR.

93
00:09:14,708 --> 00:09:17,541
- YEAH, BUT CONSIDERING HOW MUCH
WATER WE HAVE LEFT.

94
00:09:17,625 --> 00:09:20,291
- I HAVE TO WASH MY HAIR TODAY.

95
00:09:20,375 --> 00:09:22,791
- RE-L!
- TWO MORE MINUTES.

96
00:09:22,875 --> 00:09:25,625
YOUR HAIR'S SHORT.
YOU ONLY NEED A MINUTE.

97
00:09:25,708 --> 00:09:28,125
- YEAH, BUT--

98
00:09:28,208 --> 00:09:29,458
- AFTER TALKING IT OVER,

99
00:09:29,541 --> 00:09:31,750
WE ARRIVED
AT A TEMPORARY AGREEMENT

100
00:09:31,833 --> 00:09:34,833
ON THE WATER SHORTAGE PROBLEM.

101
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:45,625
- WHAT'S THE MATTER?

102
00:09:47,875 --> 00:09:50,291
- EYE EXERCISES.  THAT'S ALL.

103
00:09:50,375 --> 00:09:51,750
- OH.

104
00:09:57,791 --> 00:10:00,333
- LEFT, RIGHT,

105
00:10:00,416 --> 00:10:04,166
LEFT, RIGHT, LEFT.

106
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:08,000
- THERE WAS A MARKED DECLINE IN
THE CREW'S MORALE THIS MORNING.

107
00:10:08,083 --> 00:10:10,541
IT'S BEEN THREE HOURS
ALREADY.

108
00:10:19,625 --> 00:10:22,916
WHAT THE HELL ARE THEY DOING?

109
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:28,291
THE FOOD SHORTAGE CONTINUES
TO GROW WORSE.

110
00:10:32,916 --> 00:10:35,666
- YEAH, I KNOW.
NOT BEANS AGAIN.

111
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:37,666
- I WAS THINKING THAT,

112
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:40,666
BUT WHY ARRANGE THEM
IN A PATTERN?

113
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:42,208
- WELL, I THOUGHT GIVING THEM
A NEW LOOK

114
00:10:42,291 --> 00:10:44,541
MIGHT MAKE IT BETTER.

115
00:10:49,125 --> 00:10:52,750
- WITHOUT A DOUBT THE ACT ITSELF
RAISES SOME SERIOUS QUESTIONS.

116
00:10:52,833 --> 00:10:55,375
I CAN'T COMPREHEND WHY,
BUT STARING AT THE SERENE

117
00:10:55,458 --> 00:10:58,250
EXPRESSION ON HIS FACE
IS BEGINNING TO IRRITATE ME.

118
00:11:04,791 --> 00:11:06,708
( grunting )

119
00:11:12,833 --> 00:11:15,250
THE AFTERNOON COMES.

120
00:11:18,375 --> 00:11:21,291
NO CHANGE.

121
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:25,750
( sighs )

122
00:11:51,625 --> 00:11:54,000
( gasps )

123
00:11:58,666 --> 00:12:01,708
OH.

124
00:12:01,791 --> 00:12:03,375
BRAND-NEW.

125
00:12:05,916 --> 00:12:07,916
THAT IDIOT.

126
00:12:16,541 --> 00:12:18,916
- ( yawns )

127
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:31,583
- WHAT'S THIS?
- ( vibrates )

128
00:12:31,666 --> 00:12:35,291
- ON THIS JOURNEY SUCH AS THIS,
UNDER THESE CONDITIONS,

129
00:12:35,375 --> 00:12:38,041
IT SOMETIMES DAWNS ON ME
THAT THERE IS A WALL,

130
00:12:38,125 --> 00:12:40,750
A WALL BETWEEN
PROXIES AND PEOPLE.

131
00:12:40,833 --> 00:12:43,750
A WALL BETWEEN PEOPLE
AND INFECTED AUTOREIVS

132
00:12:43,833 --> 00:12:46,125
FOR THAT MATTER.  AN ESSENTIAL
LEVEL OF COMMUNICATION

133
00:12:46,208 --> 00:12:47,625
CAN NEVER TAKE PLACE.

134
00:12:47,708 --> 00:12:51,541
WE'RE EACH DISTINCTLY SEPARATE
FROM THE OTHER.

135
00:12:51,625 --> 00:12:54,041
THERE ARE MOMENTS
WHEN THIS TRUTH RESONATES

136
00:12:54,125 --> 00:12:56,541
TO MY VERY CORE.

137
00:13:04,333 --> 00:13:07,000
WHAT THE HELL ARE THEY?

138
00:13:15,083 --> 00:13:19,833
- WHAT THE--
- Pino: HEY, VINCE, LOOK!

139
00:13:19,916 --> 00:13:22,166
- HUH?  NOT AGAIN.

140
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:23,708
SHE'S GONNA GET MAD, YOU KNOW?

141
00:13:23,791 --> 00:13:26,041
- I'M GONNA DO YOUR MAKEUP NOW,
VINCE.

142
00:13:26,125 --> 00:13:29,333
- STOP IT.
- HERE, TAKE A LOOK.

143
00:13:29,416 --> 00:13:33,083
- I TOLD YOU TO STOP.

144
00:13:33,166 --> 00:13:34,333
BUT SINCE YOU STARTED ALREADY,

145
00:13:34,416 --> 00:13:37,041
HOW ABOUT A LITTLE MORE HERE?

146
00:13:37,125 --> 00:13:38,333
- OH, RE-L'S BACK.

147
00:13:38,416 --> 00:13:39,833
- HUH?

148
00:13:39,916 --> 00:13:43,791
- LOOK AT VINCE.
HE'S PRETTY.

149
00:13:48,916 --> 00:13:51,500
- LOOKS LIKE FUN.

150
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:56,958
- I'M SORRY!  RE-L!

151
00:14:04,833 --> 00:14:08,291
- STANDING BEFORE THIS VAST,
ENDLESS LANDSCAPE,

152
00:14:08,375 --> 00:14:11,416
IT OCCURS TO ME JUST HOW
POWERLESS AND INSIGNIFICANT

153
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:13,375
WE ALL ARE.

154
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:21,916
SO WHAT'S ARE YOUR THOUGHTS
ON OUR CURRENT SITUATION?

155
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,083
ANY IDEA HOW WE'RE
GETTING OUT OF THIS?

156
00:14:24,166 --> 00:14:27,375
- I'M NOT SURE WHAT
YOU'RE EXPECTING ME TO SAY.

157
00:14:27,458 --> 00:14:30,500
AM I SUPPOSED TO KNOW HOW
TO MAKE THE WIND START BLOWING?

158
00:14:30,583 --> 00:14:32,041
- AND?

159
00:14:32,125 --> 00:14:35,250
- AND NOTHING.  THAT'S IT.
- JUST NOTHING?

160
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:37,666
- YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.
IT'S JUST NOTHING.

161
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:39,791
AND WHAT'S NOTHING SUPPOSED
TO MEAN?

162
00:14:39,875 --> 00:14:42,375
IS IT NOTHING BECAUSE
YOU'VE REALLY THOUGHT ABOUT IT?

163
00:14:42,458 --> 00:14:44,875
OR IS IT NOTHING
BECAUSE YOU HAVEN'T EVEN TRIED?

164
00:14:44,958 --> 00:14:47,541
WHILE WE'RE ON THE SUBJECT,
WHY DO YOU INSIST ON DROWNING

165
00:14:47,625 --> 00:14:50,666
MY FOOD IN THAT AWFUL DRESSING
WITHOUT ASKING ME?

166
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:51,958
OR IS THE DRESSING PART
OF YOUR PLAN

167
00:14:52,041 --> 00:14:54,000
TO DESTROY MY SENSE OF TASTE?

168
00:14:54,083 --> 00:14:55,541
- WELL, UM--

169
00:14:55,625 --> 00:14:58,291
- IF YOU HAVE SOMETHING YOU WANT
TO SAY, THEN SAY IT.

170
00:14:58,375 --> 00:15:00,875
I DON'T GET THE SENSE
THAT YOU CAN DEAL WITH ANYTHING.

171
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:02,375
LOOK AT THIS TRIP WE'RE ON.

172
00:15:02,458 --> 00:15:04,416
YOU'RE JUST MAKING IT UP
AS WE GO.

173
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,958
HAVE YOU EVER ACTUALLY
MADE A PLAN?

174
00:15:07,041 --> 00:15:10,375
- WELL, I THOUGHT IF WE JUST
MADE IT TO MOSK, THEN--

175
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:14,125
I'M SORRY.

176
00:15:14,208 --> 00:15:15,916
- SORRY DOES NOT MAKE IT BETTER.

177
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,541
- I'M SORRY--
- ( both sigh )

178
00:15:18,625 --> 00:15:21,291
- WHY CAN'T YOU JUST BE STRONG
ABOUT SOMETHING?

179
00:15:21,375 --> 00:15:23,625
AND DON'T YOU DARE
TRY AND GIVE ME THAT

180
00:15:23,708 --> 00:15:25,916
"HERE SHE GOES AGAIN" LOOK.
IT SICKENS ME.

181
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,875
- WELL, I JUST FIGURED
IF WE WAIT,

182
00:15:29,958 --> 00:15:31,375
THE WIND WILL COME BACK, RIGHT?

183
00:15:31,458 --> 00:15:35,000
- IS THAT SERIOUSLY YOUR PLAN?

184
00:15:35,083 --> 00:15:36,875
THAT IS THE STUPIDEST--

185
00:15:36,958 --> 00:15:39,333
( sighs ) FORGET IT.

186
00:15:41,708 --> 00:15:44,125
I'M BORED AGAIN.

187
00:15:44,208 --> 00:15:47,083
I DECIDE TO OBSERVE THE AUTOREIV
AS A BRIEF DIVERSION.

188
00:15:51,208 --> 00:15:55,125
- OH, NO!
HOW'D THAT HAPPEN?!

189
00:15:55,208 --> 00:15:56,583
DON'T YOU DARE TRY
AND GIVE ME THAT

190
00:15:56,666 --> 00:16:00,166
"HERE SHE GOES AGAIN" LOOK.
IT SICKENS ME.

191
00:16:03,208 --> 00:16:06,583
- THE BOREDOM PERSISTS.

192
00:16:06,666 --> 00:16:08,625
MY REASON DETERIORATES.

193
00:16:08,708 --> 00:16:11,625
( sighs )

194
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:17,458
ALL I SEE ARE PROBLEMS.

195
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:20,250
- RE-L.

196
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:26,125
- I'VE TRIED TO UNDERSTAND.

197
00:16:29,791 --> 00:16:33,291
( sighs )

198
00:16:33,375 --> 00:16:35,666
BUT IT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

199
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:38,208
A PREDAWN SNOW.

200
00:16:38,291 --> 00:16:41,666
OUR CIRCUMSTANCES
REMAIN UNCHANGED.

201
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:44,250
I GET UP AS USUAL.

202
00:16:54,458 --> 00:16:56,208
I ASSESS THE SITUATION.

203
00:16:56,291 --> 00:16:59,166
IT'S AS CALM AS EVER.

204
00:17:03,791 --> 00:17:05,666
- ( exhales )

205
00:17:08,666 --> 00:17:10,458
ON SUCH A BONE-CHILLING DAY,

206
00:17:10,541 --> 00:17:14,375
EVEN WHEN IT'S TIME TO GET UP,
MY BODY JUST WON'T COMPLY.

207
00:17:14,458 --> 00:17:16,875
- Vincent: WOW, IT'S COLD!
( laughing )

208
00:17:16,958 --> 00:17:19,958
- Pino: SNOW!  RE-L!

209
00:17:20,041 --> 00:17:22,958
THERE'S SNOW OUTSIDE!
COME PLAY WITH ME.

210
00:17:23,041 --> 00:17:26,041
RE-L.

211
00:17:26,125 --> 00:17:27,916
HEY.

212
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,833
HEY.

213
00:17:29,916 --> 00:17:32,458
- PINO, COME TAKE A LOOK!
THERE'S AN AURORA.

214
00:17:32,541 --> 00:17:34,500
- WHAT'S THAT?

215
00:17:34,583 --> 00:17:38,458
OH, WOW, IT'S SO PRETTY.
- ( laughing )

216
00:17:55,125 --> 00:17:58,000
- Vincent: COME ON!
( echoing )

217
00:17:59,583 --> 00:18:03,708
COME ON, YOU STUPID WIND.

218
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:07,000
COME AND GET ME.

219
00:18:09,041 --> 00:18:11,250
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

220
00:18:11,333 --> 00:18:14,583
- I'M RIGHT HERE
WAITING FOR YOU.

221
00:18:20,083 --> 00:18:21,791
- I DON'T GET HIM.

222
00:18:21,875 --> 00:18:25,791
- DAMN.  COME ON.

223
00:18:25,875 --> 00:18:28,875
COME ON, YOU STUPID BASTARD.

224
00:18:30,083 --> 00:18:33,791
YEAH.  COME ON.

225
00:18:33,875 --> 00:18:36,625
COME ON, DAMN IT.
( grunting )

226
00:18:36,708 --> 00:18:39,458
- WE USE AS LITTLE ELECTRICITY
AS POSSIBLE

227
00:18:39,541 --> 00:18:40,708
TO SAVE IT
FOR AN EMERGENCY.

228
00:18:40,791 --> 00:18:44,208
- ( whirring )

229
00:18:47,625 --> 00:18:50,375
- SHE'S WATCHING ME.

230
00:18:53,416 --> 00:18:57,125
AND SHE'S SAYING SOMETHING.
I WONDER.

231
00:18:57,208 --> 00:19:00,625
- SHAVE IT.  SHAVE IT.

232
00:19:00,708 --> 00:19:02,708
- COULD SHE BE--

233
00:19:05,541 --> 00:19:06,833
NO, SHE COULDN'T.

234
00:19:11,416 --> 00:19:13,333
- MAYBE IT'S MALNUTRITION,

235
00:19:13,416 --> 00:19:16,083
BUT MY MIND
FEELS LIKE IT'S ON THE BRINK.

236
00:19:16,166 --> 00:19:18,375
MY NERVES ARE SHOT.

237
00:19:18,458 --> 00:19:21,833
I DON'T THINK I CAN
TAKE MUCH MORE.

238
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,750
( exhales )

239
00:20:03,166 --> 00:20:06,333
I SLEEP SOUNDLY FOR THE FIRST
TIME IN AGES.

240
00:20:06,416 --> 00:20:08,041
I DREAM ABOUT IGGY.

241
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,125
- Both: SHH!

242
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,958
- ( laughing )

243
00:20:46,541 --> 00:20:49,875
- ALL I HAVE LEFT IS MY WILL.
I NEED A CANDLE.

244
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:53,166
VINCENT.
- YEAH, SURE.

245
00:21:06,416 --> 00:21:07,916
OW!

246
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,375
- ( laughing )

247
00:21:10,458 --> 00:21:12,666
- WHAT WAS THAT FOR?

248
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:15,416
- IT WAS NOTHING.
- IT DIDN'T FEEL LIKE NOTHING.

249
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:17,916
- HEY, DON'T GIVE ME THAT LOOK.

250
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,583
- HUH?

251
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:32,625
- ( gasps )

252
00:21:51,291 --> 00:21:53,708
- OW.

253
00:21:53,791 --> 00:21:56,916
- JUST HOPELESS.  OH!

254
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,833
- HEY, ARE YOU OKAY?

255
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:09,291
- OH!
- GOTCHA!

256
00:22:09,375 --> 00:22:11,750
BYE.

257
00:22:11,833 --> 00:22:14,583
- PINO, WAIT UP.

258
00:22:24,875 --> 00:22:27,958
- Re-l:
COME ON, YOU STUPID WIND!

259
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:32,750
COME AND GET ME.

260
00:22:35,333 --> 00:22:36,416
- RE-L.

261
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:38,791
- I'M HERE WAITING FOR YOU.

262
00:22:44,083 --> 00:22:46,375
I FEEL A LOT BETTER.

263
00:22:52,875 --> 00:22:57,041
- ( laughs ) I TOTALLY JUST
GOT YOU IN THE FACE.

264
00:22:57,125 --> 00:23:00,375
- IT'S NOT FUNNY.
- COME AND GET ME.

265
00:23:02,666 --> 00:23:04,333
- Re-l: FINDING A WAY OUT
OF THIS MIGHT BE EASIER

266
00:23:04,416 --> 00:23:06,708
THAN I THOUGHT.

267
00:23:06,791 --> 00:23:10,666
I REALIZED THAT OVER-THINKING
IT WAS A WASTE.

268
00:23:12,375 --> 00:23:15,416
WHAT'S MORE,
FOR SOME REASON...

269
00:23:43,375 --> 00:23:45,791
- PINO.

270
00:23:47,958 --> 00:23:49,875
- FOR SOME REASON,

271
00:23:49,958 --> 00:23:53,208
I FELT I COULD FINALLY SMILE.

272
00:24:03,958 --> 00:24:07,875

- ( gasps ) THERE'S WIND!
