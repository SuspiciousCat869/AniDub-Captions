00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,333
- Vincent: WHERE AM I?

3
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,041
WHAT IS THIS PLACE?

4
00:00:59,125 --> 00:01:00,041
AM I...?

5
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,500
- IT'S OKAY.  YOU'RE GOING
TO BE COMPLETELY FINE.

6
00:01:04,583 --> 00:01:05,791
- Vincent:
WHO IS THAT?

7
00:01:05,875 --> 00:01:08,291
- IT'S GOOD TO FINALLY
SEE YOU AGAIN, RE-L.

8
00:01:08,375 --> 00:01:10,583
- Vincent:
RE-L? RE-L'S HERE TOO?

9
00:01:10,666 --> 00:01:13,583
- DOCTOR.

10
00:01:13,666 --> 00:01:14,916
HOW ARE YOU FEELING?

11
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,625
- Re-L:
IS IT OKAY IF I GET UP?

12
00:01:16,708 --> 00:01:18,375
- Vincent: RE-L?

13
00:01:18,458 --> 00:01:19,875
- SURE.  GO AHEAD.

14
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,208

00:01:29,333 --> 00:01:30,916
( gasps )

16
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,875
WHAT THE HELL'S GOING ON?

- Derrida: RE-L.

30
00:03:22,291 --> 00:03:26,708
THERE HAS BEEN MUCH DEBATE
OVER HOW BEST TO DEAL WITH YOU.

31
00:03:26,791 --> 00:03:29,708
- Lacan: YOUR RECENT BOUT
OF DESTRUCTIVE SELFISH BEHAVIOR

32
00:03:29,791 --> 00:03:33,291
GOES FAR BEYOND WHAT WE CAN
EXPECT FROM A FELLOW CITIZEN.

33
00:03:33,375 --> 00:03:36,041
- Berkeley: THE SAME THING
CAN BE SAID OF YOU, RAUL. 

34
00:03:36,125 --> 00:03:37,958
- YES.
- Derrida: NEVERTHELESS,

35
00:03:38,041 --> 00:03:39,875
RE-L'S RETURN 
BRINGS WITH IT

36
00:03:39,958 --> 00:03:42,458
SOMETHING OF ENORMOUS
CONSEQUENCE.

37
00:03:42,541 --> 00:03:44,291
- Husserl:
BECAUSE OF RE-L,

38
00:03:44,375 --> 00:03:46,291
ROMDEAU MAY LIVE ON.

39
00:03:46,375 --> 00:03:48,541
- Lacan: THE REGENT
HAS EXPRESSED HIS PLEASURE

40
00:03:48,625 --> 00:03:49,958
UPON HEARING THIS NEWS.

41
00:03:50,041 --> 00:03:52,916
- ( gasps )
MY GRANDFATHER?

42
00:03:54,416 --> 00:03:58,166
- Vincent: AT FIRST,
I WAS COMPLETELY BAFFLED.

43
00:03:59,625 --> 00:04:03,708
BUT SLOWLY,
I BEGAN TO UNDERSTAND.

44
00:04:03,791 --> 00:04:05,416
SOMEHOW MY MIND...

45
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:07,750
MY WILL...

46
00:04:07,833 --> 00:04:10,458
THE IDENTITY OF
VINCENT LAW

47
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:13,708
HAD BECOME TRAPPED WITHIN
THE MIND OF RE-L.

48
00:04:16,041 --> 00:04:20,458
TO PUT IT SIMPLY,
WHATEVER RE-L SEES, I SEE.

49
00:04:20,541 --> 00:04:22,875
WHATEVER SHE HEARS,
I HEAR.

50
00:04:26,208 --> 00:04:27,666
- Swan: RE-L.

51
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:29,458
- HUH?
- SWAN.

52
00:04:29,541 --> 00:04:32,083
RIGHT ON TIME,
AS ALWAYS.

53
00:04:34,458 --> 00:04:36,166
- SWAN?
- I KNOW I MENTIONED HER

54
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:38,625
ON THE WAY OVER HERE.
- HMM.

55
00:04:38,708 --> 00:04:40,791
- I'M SORRY.
I HOPE I'M NOT INTRUDING.

56
00:04:40,875 --> 00:04:43,916
- NO, I JUST DIDN'T RECOGNIZE
YOU WITHOUT YOUR LAB COAT.

57
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,500
I'M SORRY.

58
00:04:46,583 --> 00:04:49,250
- Vincent: THERE WAS NOTHING
IN WHAT THEY SAID OR DID

59
00:04:49,333 --> 00:04:50,750
THAT REFLECTED MY PRESENCE.

60
00:04:53,875 --> 00:04:57,791
I HADN'T THE SLIGHTEST
INFLUENCE ON RE-L'S ACTIONS.

61
00:04:57,875 --> 00:05:00,791
NO ONE EVEN KNEW I WAS THERE.

62
00:05:00,875 --> 00:05:02,416
- Daedalus: IS IT GOOD?

63
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:05,416
- OH, YEAH.
- GOOD.  I'M GLAD.

64
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:08,583
- INDEED.  THE CHEF HAS
QUITE THE REPUTATION.

65
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:11,666
- Re-L:
IT'S SO STRANGE.

66
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:14,041
NOT LONG AGO,
HAVING ANY FOOD

67
00:05:14,125 --> 00:05:15,708
WOULD HAVE BEEN
A LUXURY.

68
00:05:15,791 --> 00:05:17,708
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN
LIFE IN ROMDEAU

69
00:05:17,791 --> 00:05:20,833
AND THE OUTSIDE WORLD
COULDN'T BE GREATER. 

70
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:25,166
- THIS PLACE IS FAMOUS.

71
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:26,666
THEY CALL IT "THE CRADLE."

72
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:28,666
IN FACT,

73
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:30,166
YOU CAN'T EVEN 
GET IN THE DOOR

74
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:33,916
UNLESS YOU'RE ONE OF
THE FEW ELITE FELLOW CITIZENS.

75
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,166
A PRIVILEGE
RESERVED FOR US.

76
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:39,833
- MY GRANDFATHER...
- HUH?

77
00:05:39,916 --> 00:05:41,958
- HE ONLY SEEMED PLEASED

78
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:44,875
ABOUT WHAT MY RETURN
MEANT FOR ROMDEAU.

79
00:05:44,958 --> 00:05:47,541
I UNDERSTAND.

80
00:05:47,625 --> 00:05:48,875
FOR MY GRANDFATHER,

81
00:05:48,958 --> 00:05:50,791
NOTHING IS MORE IMPORTANT
THAN FIGURING OUT

82
00:05:50,875 --> 00:05:53,208
HOW TO KEEP ROMDEAU
FROM FALLING APART.

83
00:05:53,291 --> 00:05:55,208
IN THE END,

84
00:05:55,291 --> 00:05:58,166
I SIMPLY END UP SERVING
MY GRANDFATHER'S INTERESTS.

85
00:06:00,291 --> 00:06:02,208
YEAH, I KNOW.

86
00:06:02,291 --> 00:06:04,416
IT'S SELFISH OF ME
TO BE FRAMING EVENTS

87
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,416
IN TERMS OF WHAT I LOST.

88
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:07,583
- RE-L--

89
00:06:07,666 --> 00:06:09,208
- AND I'M STILL
WHINING ABOUT IT.

90
00:06:09,291 --> 00:06:10,166
SORRY.

91
00:06:13,541 --> 00:06:14,458
- ( beeps )

92
00:06:16,291 --> 00:06:19,166
- Vincent:
THEN TIME JUMPS AHEAD.

93
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:20,875
I MEAN...

94
00:06:20,958 --> 00:06:22,208
I DIDN'T REALLY JUMP.

95
00:06:22,291 --> 00:06:25,916
MY AWARENESS
JUST SORT OF SKIPPED.

96
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,041
MY PERCEPTION OF THE WORLD
IS VERY FRAGMENTED

97
00:06:29,125 --> 00:06:30,916
IN MY CURRENT STATE.

98
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,208
THERE ARE SO MANY THINGS
I WISH I COULD ASK RE-L.

99
00:06:35,291 --> 00:06:38,875
ARE PINO AND I
SOMEWHERE IN THIS CITY?

100
00:06:43,791 --> 00:06:45,250
- ( sighs )

101
00:06:45,333 --> 00:06:46,916
- Vincent: OF COURSE...

102
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,875
MY QUESTIONS
ARE NEVER ANSWERED.

103
00:06:50,333 --> 00:06:53,916
THE NEXT DAY, RE-L ASKED
TO GO SEE THE SENSON.

104
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,250
- MY, WE'RE BEING CAREFUL,
AREN'T WE?

105
00:06:56,333 --> 00:06:58,916
- WE'RE JUST TRYING TO PROTECT
ROMDEAU FROM CONTAMINANTS.

106
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,875
BRINGS BACK MEMORIES,
DOESN'T IT?

107
00:07:08,708 --> 00:07:10,625
WOULD YOU LIKE TO
SEE VINCENT LAW? 

108
00:07:10,708 --> 00:07:12,208
- ( gasps )

109
00:07:12,291 --> 00:07:15,041
- Vincent: THAT WAS THE FIRST
TIME I HAD HEARD MY OWN NAME.

110
00:07:17,041 --> 00:07:20,000
I REALLY WAS SOMEWHERE
IN THE CITY.

111
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:24,958
- NO.
- FOR SOME REASON,

112
00:07:25,041 --> 00:07:28,166
RE-L REFUSED TO SEE ME.

113
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:31,291
- I WAS BECOMING FRUSTRATED
WATCHING HER LIFE

114
00:07:31,375 --> 00:07:34,375
WHILE MINE WAS LEFT
ABANDONED AND IGNORED.

115
00:07:35,708 --> 00:07:37,416
WAS THERE NO WAY
FOR ME TO TELL HER

116
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:38,791
THAT I WAS HERE?

117
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:40,750
- ( TV static )
- ( gasps )

118
00:07:40,833 --> 00:07:45,291
- I WAS WONDERING IF YOU FELT
THIS EXPERIENCE HAD CHANGED YOU?

119
00:07:45,375 --> 00:07:47,541
SOMEHOW I GET THAT FEELING.

120
00:07:47,625 --> 00:07:49,083
- WHY IS THAT?

121
00:07:49,166 --> 00:07:51,708
- I ONLY SAY THAT
BECAUSE THE OTHER DAY AT DINNER

122
00:07:51,791 --> 00:07:53,708
I NOTICED YOU APOLOGIZED
THREE TIMES.

123
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:58,791
THE FIRST TIME I NOTICED WAS 
WHEN YOU DIDN'T RECOGNIZE ME.

124
00:07:58,875 --> 00:08:01,000
THE SECOND WAS WHEN YOU
WERE TALKING TO DR. DAEDALUS

125
00:08:01,083 --> 00:08:02,666
ABOUT THE REGENT.

126
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:05,250
AND THE THIRD WAS WHEN 
YOU DROPPED YOUR SPOON.

127
00:08:07,125 --> 00:08:09,791
- THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE DO 
WHEN THEY MAKE MISTAKES.

128
00:08:09,875 --> 00:08:12,000
THEY APOLOGIZE.

129
00:08:12,083 --> 00:08:14,333
I TAKE IT THAT DAEDALUS
HAS GOTTEN IT INTO YOUR HEAD

130
00:08:14,416 --> 00:08:16,041
THAT I'M A TOTAL
SELFISH BITCH.

131
00:08:16,125 --> 00:08:17,333
- HEAR THAT?

132
00:08:17,416 --> 00:08:19,333
EVEN THE WAY YOU SPEAK
HAS CHANGED.

133
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:21,583
THE LAST COMMENT
WAS ALMOST SELF-DEPRECATING.

134
00:08:21,666 --> 00:08:24,666
I DIDN'T NEED TO TALK
TO DR. DAEDALUS.

135
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:26,000
IT WAS IN YOUR FILE.

136
00:08:26,083 --> 00:08:28,208
- YOU READ IT?
- OF COURSE.

137
00:08:28,291 --> 00:08:31,250
IT'S MY JOB TO READ IT.
I'M YOUR COUNSELOR.

138
00:08:31,333 --> 00:08:33,708
- I DIDN'T KNOW.
- I THOUGHT YOU DID.

139
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:36,708
I'M HERE TO HELP YOU READJUST
TO LIFE AS A FELLOW CITIZEN.

140
00:08:36,791 --> 00:08:37,833
- ( sighs )

141
00:08:37,916 --> 00:08:40,750
THIS IS WORSE THAN
HAVING AN ENTOURAGE.

142
00:08:40,833 --> 00:08:45,250
SUBMIT TO REEDUCATION
TO GET MY LIFE BACK. 

143
00:08:45,333 --> 00:08:46,333
- ( TV static )

144
00:08:46,416 --> 00:08:47,750
- Vincent: I WAS
AWARE OF NOTHING

145
00:08:47,833 --> 00:08:50,041
FOR AT LEAST THE NEXT WEEK.

146
00:08:50,125 --> 00:08:53,166
I HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT HAPPENED TO RE-L

147
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:55,041
DURING THAT TIME.

148
00:08:55,125 --> 00:08:58,250
- SWAN, THERE'S SOMETHING
I WANT TO SHOW YOU.

149
00:08:58,333 --> 00:08:59,416
- HUH?

150
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:01,250
- I HAVEN'T EVEN SHOWN
THIS TO DAEDALUS.

151
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:03,458
CAN YOU KEEP A SECRET?

152
00:09:13,666 --> 00:09:14,791
- Swan: AN AUTOREIV?

153
00:09:16,166 --> 00:09:18,541
- PINO!
- LET GO OF ME.

154
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:20,958
- OH MY GOD.
- I DON'T LIKE THE DARK.

155
00:09:21,041 --> 00:09:22,291
LET ME OUT!

156
00:09:22,375 --> 00:09:24,416
- FOR THE LAST TIME,
THERE'S NOTHING I CAN DO.

157
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,750
YOU'RE INFECTED.
- I HATE YOU, RE-L.

158
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:29,041
HOW CAN YOU
DO THAT TO VINCE?

159
00:09:29,125 --> 00:09:30,416
I'M GONNA GET OUT OF HERE,

160
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:31,791
AND THEN I'M GONNA HELP HIM.

161
00:09:31,875 --> 00:09:33,333
- IDIOT!
IF YOU GO OUTSIDE,

162
00:09:33,416 --> 00:09:35,333
YOU'LL BE TURNED INTO SCRAP.

163
00:09:35,416 --> 00:09:37,666
- ( grunts, crying )

164
00:09:41,708 --> 00:09:45,416
- Vincent: PINO SAID
SHE WAS GOING TO HELP ME.

165
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:48,125
WHAT'S HAPPENED TO ME?

166
00:09:48,208 --> 00:09:51,625
- Swan: RE-L?

167
00:09:51,708 --> 00:09:54,666
I THINK IT'S BEST IF YOU
GO SEE VINCENT TOMORROW.

168
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:56,041
IT'LL BE FINE.

169
00:09:56,125 --> 00:09:57,583
I'LL EVEN
COME ALONG WITH YOU.

170
00:10:03,541 --> 00:10:05,791
- Daedalus: IF THE COMPUTERS
DETECT ANY SUDDEN MOVEMENT, 

171
00:10:05,875 --> 00:10:10,166
THEY SEND A BURST OF F.P.
RADIATION THROUGHOUT HIS BODY.

172
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:12,458
NATURALLY,
I'VE EXPLAINED IT TO HIM,

173
00:10:12,541 --> 00:10:15,458
AND SINCE HE'S SEEN
HOW EFFECTIVE F.P. SHELLS WERE,

174
00:10:15,541 --> 00:10:17,416
HE'S BEEN VERY WELL BEHAVED.

175
00:10:26,041 --> 00:10:29,000
- OH, VINCENT.

176
00:10:29,083 --> 00:10:33,208
- DO YOU REALLY WANT TO
GET THAT CLOSE?

177
00:10:33,291 --> 00:10:36,166
IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME,
RE-L MAYER.

178
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:39,500
I KNOW THAT THEY'LL KILL ME
IF I MAKE ANY SUDDEN MOVES.

179
00:10:39,583 --> 00:10:43,833
STILL, I THINK I'D HAVE
ENOUGH TIME TO KILL YOU FIRST.

180
00:10:43,916 --> 00:10:45,500
- THEN WHY DON'T YOU?

181
00:10:45,583 --> 00:10:48,541
- BECAUSE MY LIFE IS 
TOO VALUABLE TO WASTE

182
00:10:48,625 --> 00:10:52,250
KILLING A BACK-STABBING BITCH.

183
00:10:52,333 --> 00:10:55,041
WHY DID YOU BETRAY ME?

184
00:10:55,125 --> 00:10:56,500
WHY?

185
00:10:56,583 --> 00:10:59,500
Vincent:
RE-L BETRAYED ME.

186
00:10:59,583 --> 00:11:02,500
SEEING MYSELF LIKE THAT--

187
00:11:02,583 --> 00:11:05,166
SEEING ME THROUGH HER EYES.

188
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:09,166
IS THE ME IN HERE
AND THE ME OUT THERE THE SAME?

189
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:11,166
BUT I'M DISCONNECTED.

190
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:13,833
MY WILL IS INDEPENDENT.

191
00:11:13,916 --> 00:11:17,541
IF I'M INSIDE RE-L,
CAN I ALSO BE OUT THERE?

192
00:11:17,625 --> 00:11:19,208
WHICH ME AM I?

193
00:11:19,291 --> 00:11:20,250
- ( gasps )

194
00:11:22,375 --> 00:11:26,875
- WAS IT A SHOCK?
- I'M ALL RIGHT. 

195
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:28,416
- DO YOU KNOW THE REASON WHY

196
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:31,125
I WANTED FOR YOU TO MEET WITH
VINCENT THAT WAY, RE-L?

197
00:11:31,208 --> 00:11:32,250
- NO.

198
00:11:32,333 --> 00:11:35,333
- TELL ME, HAVE YOU
BEEN EXPERIENCING

199
00:11:35,416 --> 00:11:37,541
ANY LOSS OF TIME RECENTLY?

200
00:11:37,625 --> 00:11:39,208
- NO.

201
00:11:39,291 --> 00:11:41,041
MY MIND'S A LITTLE OFF.

202
00:11:41,125 --> 00:11:43,541
- A LITTLE OFF HOW?

203
00:11:43,625 --> 00:11:45,875
- LIKE SOMEONE'S TRYING
TO TALK TO ME.

204
00:11:45,958 --> 00:11:48,791
- THAT'S RIGHT.
IT'S VINCENT LAW.

205
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:50,291
- ( gasps )

206
00:11:50,375 --> 00:11:51,958
- HELLO THERE, VINCENT.

207
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,541
- YOU CAN SEE ME?

208
00:12:07,041 --> 00:12:09,458
- THE REASON I ARRANGED 
FOR YOU AND RE-L TO MEET

209
00:12:09,541 --> 00:12:11,916
WAS SO YOU COULD HAVE 
CONTACT WITH YOURSELF.

210
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:15,916
I KNOW SEEING YOU
WAS A SHOCK FOR RE-L,

211
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,708
BUT I IMAGINE IT WAS
WORSE FOR YOU.

212
00:12:18,791 --> 00:12:20,958
- SO THAT'S WHY?

213
00:12:21,041 --> 00:12:22,375
- YES.

214
00:12:22,458 --> 00:12:25,250
I NEEDED TO GIVE
YOUR SYSTEM A SHOCK.

215
00:12:25,333 --> 00:12:28,291
IT WAS THE ONLY WAY I KNEW
HOW TO GET ACCESS TO YOU. 

216
00:12:28,375 --> 00:12:30,250
ONCE PULLED TO THE SURFACE,

217
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:33,250
ALL YOU REQUIRED WAS SOMEONE'S
CONSCIOUS ACKNOWLEDGEMENT.

218
00:12:33,333 --> 00:12:34,916
SOMEONE LIKE ME.

219
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,583
- WHAT AM I DOING
INSIDE RE-L'S MIND?

220
00:12:37,666 --> 00:12:40,416
- RE-L HAS A DISSOCIATIVE
PERSONALITY DISORDER.

221
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,833
OR IN LAYMAN'S TERMS,
A SPLIT PERSONALITY. 

222
00:12:42,916 --> 00:12:44,083
- WHAT?

223
00:12:44,166 --> 00:12:45,958
- HER OVERWHELMING GUILT

224
00:12:46,041 --> 00:12:48,833
OVER HER PERSONAL BETRAYAL
OF THE REAL VINCENT LAW

225
00:12:48,916 --> 00:12:51,958
HAS CREATED A FRAGMENTED
SUB-PERSONALITY.

226
00:12:52,041 --> 00:12:53,958
THAT WOULD BE YOU.

227
00:12:54,041 --> 00:12:55,958
- HOLD ON.

228
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:58,291
THEN YOU'RE SAYING
I'M NOT--

229
00:12:58,375 --> 00:13:00,958
I'M NOT REALLY
VINCENT LAW?

230
00:13:01,041 --> 00:13:03,625
- MORE OR LESS.
- THAT'S CRAZY.

231
00:13:03,708 --> 00:13:06,333
- HAVE YOU EXPERIENCED 
ANY LOST TIME RECENTLY?

232
00:13:06,416 --> 00:13:07,625
- ( stammers )

233
00:13:07,708 --> 00:13:09,083
SORT OF, YEAH.

234
00:13:09,166 --> 00:13:11,958
- THAT FACT RIGHT THERE
SHOULD OFFER YOU MORE PROOF

235
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:13,833
THAT YOU ARE NOT
VINCENT LAW.

236
00:13:13,916 --> 00:13:17,875
IF YOUR PERSONALITY WERE TRULY
AN INDEPENDENT ENTITY,

237
00:13:17,958 --> 00:13:19,416
RE-L'S MIND
WOULDN'T BE CAPABLE

238
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:22,208
OF INTERFERING WITH
YOUR CONSCIOUSNESS.

239
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,916
IN THE SAME WAY
RE-L'S SUBCONSCIOUS

240
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,333
FIRST CONJURED YOU UP,

241
00:13:26,416 --> 00:13:28,541
HER SUBCONSCIOUS
IS CAPABLE OF PUTTING YOU AWAY

242
00:13:28,625 --> 00:13:29,666
WHEN YOU'RE NOT NEEDED.

243
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:31,333
- WHAT DO I DO?

244
00:13:31,416 --> 00:13:32,666
- I DON'T KNOW.

245
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:34,333
REMOVING YOU WITH FORCE
AT THIS POINT

246
00:13:34,416 --> 00:13:36,375
WOULD ONLY MAKE RE-L
MORE UNSTABLE.

247
00:13:36,458 --> 00:13:39,458
THAT'S ALL THE TIME
WE HAVE FOR THIS SESSION.

248
00:13:39,541 --> 00:13:41,000
WE'LL PICK THIS UP LATER.

249
00:13:41,083 --> 00:13:42,666
GOOD-BYE, VINCENT.

250
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:45,000
ON THE COUNT OF 10,
I WANT RE-L TO RETURN.

251
00:13:45,083 --> 00:13:48,000
10, NINE, EIGHT,

252
00:13:48,083 --> 00:13:50,000
SEVEN, SIX...
- WAIT, PLEASE.

253
00:13:50,083 --> 00:13:52,583
I STILL HAVE THINGS
I NEED TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT.

254
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:56,333
-...THREE, TWO, ONE.

255
00:13:56,416 --> 00:13:57,416
- ( chuckles )

256
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:59,333
YOUR TELLING ME
VINCENT LAW'S

257
00:13:59,416 --> 00:14:00,666
INSIDE OF ME?

258
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:02,583
THAT'S A DISTURBING IDEA.

259
00:14:10,041 --> 00:14:12,708
- Vincent:
RE-L, DON'T TOUCH THAT!

260
00:14:12,791 --> 00:14:14,250
- UH?

261
00:14:14,333 --> 00:14:15,625
OH...

262
00:14:19,916 --> 00:14:20,791
( gasps )

263
00:14:22,458 --> 00:14:23,541
( gasps )

264
00:14:26,125 --> 00:14:28,625
- HELLO, VINCENT.
YOU KNOW IT'S BEEN A WEEK.

265
00:14:28,708 --> 00:14:30,625
- ( sighs )

266
00:14:30,708 --> 00:14:34,250
- I DIDN'T THINK RE-L WOULD
BE COMING BY HERE ANYMORE.

267
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:35,625
- HUH?

268
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:38,416
- WERE YOU EVEN AWARE
RE-L CALLED TO TELL ME THAT?

269
00:14:40,125 --> 00:14:41,041
- Vincent: NO.

270
00:14:41,125 --> 00:14:43,041
- I RECORDED IT.

271
00:14:43,125 --> 00:14:47,541
- Re-L: SWAN, I'M NOT GONNA BE 
COMING TO OUR SESSIONS ANYMORE.

272
00:14:47,625 --> 00:14:49,541
I'D BE LYING IF I SAID
THIS VINCENT THING

273
00:14:49,625 --> 00:14:52,083
WASN'T BOTHERING ME,
BUT THERE IT IS.

274
00:14:52,166 --> 00:14:55,416
I REALLY JUST FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE
WITH HOW YOU HANDLED THINGS.

275
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,541
I JUST DON'T FEEL
LIKE I CAN TRUST YOU.

276
00:14:57,625 --> 00:15:00,750
I'M SORRY.
- ( beeps )

277
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:02,750
- STILL, YOU CAME HERE.

278
00:15:06,166 --> 00:15:08,666
IF RE-L'S CONSCIOUSNESS
IS BEGINNING TO LOSE TIME

279
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:11,083
THE WAY YOURS DOES, 
THAT WOULD EXPLAIN--

280
00:15:11,166 --> 00:15:12,416
NO.

281
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:14,625
SHE CAME HERE AND I THINK
WHAT'S HAPPENING

282
00:15:14,708 --> 00:15:17,416
IS THAT YOUR WILL IS BEGINNING
TO AFFECT HER SUBCONSCIOUSLY.

283
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:18,541
- I'M DOING WHAT?

284
00:15:18,625 --> 00:15:19,791
- COME OUT, RE-L.

285
00:15:19,875 --> 00:15:20,791
- ( gasps )

286
00:15:23,833 --> 00:15:25,083
- WHAT AM I DOING HERE?

287
00:15:25,166 --> 00:15:28,208
I THOUGHT I WAS
IN MY ROOM.

288
00:15:28,291 --> 00:15:29,791
( gasps )

289
00:15:29,875 --> 00:15:32,791
HELLO?  SWAN!

290
00:15:32,875 --> 00:15:34,791
YOU THERE?

291
00:15:34,875 --> 00:15:36,708
- Swan: VINCENT?
- ( gasps )

292
00:15:36,791 --> 00:15:39,458
- Swan: YOU'RE RESPONSIBLE
FOR THIS, VINCENT.

293
00:15:39,541 --> 00:15:41,041
- I AM?

294
00:15:41,125 --> 00:15:42,916
- YOUR TRYING SUBCONSCIOUSLY

295
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,916
TO TAKE OVER
CONTROL OF RE-L.

296
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,208
- I'M NOT.

297
00:15:46,291 --> 00:15:48,458
- YOU'VE BEEN SPYING
ON HER THIS WHOLE TIME.

298
00:15:48,541 --> 00:15:50,458
JUST WAITING FOR
SUCH AN OPPORTUNITY.

299
00:15:50,541 --> 00:15:51,500
- STOP IT.

300
00:15:53,875 --> 00:15:56,125
SWAN, PLEASE, HELP ME.

301
00:15:56,208 --> 00:15:58,000
WHAT SHOULD I DO?

302
00:15:58,083 --> 00:16:00,791
HOW CAN I REMOVE MYSELF
FROM RE-L?

303
00:16:00,875 --> 00:16:02,541
- IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT?

304
00:16:02,625 --> 00:16:05,541
- FOR RE-L,
I'LL DO ANYTHING.

305
00:16:05,625 --> 00:16:07,458
AND YOU KNOW A WAY
FOR ME TO DO IT,

306
00:16:07,541 --> 00:16:09,375
DON'T YOU, SWAN?

307
00:16:09,458 --> 00:16:11,541
- PERHAPS ONE WAY.

308
00:16:11,625 --> 00:16:14,333
- BY LETTING RE-L
SEE YOUR PAST.

309
00:16:14,416 --> 00:16:15,958
- MY PAST?

310
00:16:16,041 --> 00:16:17,833
THAT'S GONNA BE DIFFICULT.

311
00:16:17,916 --> 00:16:20,500
I DON'T REMEMBER
ANYTHING ABOUT MY PAST.

312
00:16:20,583 --> 00:16:22,833
- THAT'S FINE.
- ( sighs )

313
00:16:22,916 --> 00:16:26,375
- YOU REALLY AREN'T
VINCENT ANYWAY.

314
00:16:26,458 --> 00:16:28,500
JUST SHOW HER THE PAST
YOU IMAGINE.

315
00:16:28,583 --> 00:16:30,625
- THE PAST I IMAGINE?

316
00:16:30,708 --> 00:16:33,416
- Swan: YOUR DESIRES,
MORE OR LESS.

317
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:36,208
NOW JUST RELAX,

318
00:16:36,291 --> 00:16:39,291
AND LET'S DRIFT INTO
THE LAND OF YOUR SUBCONSCIOUS.

319
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:43,416
THE WORLD YOU DESIRE.

320
00:16:53,958 --> 00:16:55,750
- HOW'S IT COMING?

321
00:16:55,833 --> 00:16:58,083
- EVERYTHING'S RUNNING
LIKE CLOCKWORK, SIR.

322
00:16:58,166 --> 00:17:02,250
- I'M GLAD TO HAVE BRILLIANT MEN
SUCH AS YOURSELF ON MY STAFF.

323
00:17:02,333 --> 00:17:04,875
- THANK YOU, SIR.
- OH, YES.

324
00:17:04,958 --> 00:17:07,083
I'VE HEARD YOUR MARRIAGE
IS GOING WELL.

325
00:17:07,166 --> 00:17:08,500
- WHO'VE YOU BEEN TALKING TO?

326
00:17:08,583 --> 00:17:11,125
- PLEASE, IT'S NOTHING
TO BE EMBARRASSED ABOUT.

327
00:17:11,208 --> 00:17:14,000
I'M GETTING READY TO
START A FAMILY MYSELF.

328
00:17:14,083 --> 00:17:17,958
I WANTED TO ASK YOUR ADVICE
FOR A HAPPY MARRIAGE.

329
00:17:27,625 --> 00:17:30,208
- ( sighs )
- IS SOMETHING WRONG?

330
00:17:30,291 --> 00:17:33,583
- HUH? IT'S JUST, WE BOTH
ALWAYS SEEM SO BUSY.

331
00:17:33,666 --> 00:17:35,708
- OH, IS THAT WHAT'S
BOTHERING YOU?

332
00:17:35,791 --> 00:17:37,958
WITH ME AS CHIEF OF
THE SECURITY BUREAU

333
00:17:38,041 --> 00:17:39,916
AND YOU IN
THE INTELLIGENCE BUREAU,

334
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,916
WE JUST HAVE TO ACCEPT
THAT IT'S GOING TO BE HARD

335
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,583
TO FIND TIME.
- Daedalus: DON'T WORRY.

336
00:17:43,666 --> 00:17:45,250
ONCE YOU'RE MARRIED, 
YOU'LL SEE EACH OTHER

337
00:17:45,333 --> 00:17:47,250
EVERY SINGLE DAY,
LIKE IT OR NOT.

338
00:17:47,333 --> 00:17:48,250
- DAEDALUS.

339
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:50,458
- MY SISTER CAN BE
A SELFISH BRAT.

340
00:17:50,541 --> 00:17:52,916
- YOU'RE RUNNING LATE.
- SORRY, SIS.

341
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,583
MY CLASS JUST RAN LONG.

342
00:17:54,666 --> 00:17:55,791
- OH, REALLY?

343
00:17:55,875 --> 00:17:58,250
THE WAY I HEAR IT,
YOU HARDLY EVER MAKE IT.

344
00:17:58,333 --> 00:17:59,916
- WELL, IT'S SO BORING.

345
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,500
DON'T WORRY, I PROMISE
THAT I'M GONNA KEEP MEETING

346
00:18:02,583 --> 00:18:04,958
THE MINIMUM ATTENDANCE
REQUIREMENT, 'KAY?

347
00:18:05,041 --> 00:18:08,125
- I HEAR YOU'RE QUITE THE
EXCEPTIONAL STUDENT, DAEDALUS.

348
00:18:08,208 --> 00:18:10,708
- MY BROTHER JUST TESTS WELL.

349
00:18:10,791 --> 00:18:12,625
- AND I'VE HEARD QUITE
A LOT ABOUT YOU,

350
00:18:12,708 --> 00:18:14,625
SECURITY CHIEF
VINCENT LAW.

351
00:18:14,708 --> 00:18:17,958
- YOU HAVE QUITE THE REPUTATION
AS A FELLOW CITIZEN.

352
00:18:18,041 --> 00:18:20,625
THAT BEING SAID,
IS THIS SHREW REALLY THE BEST--

353
00:18:20,708 --> 00:18:21,666
- DAEDALUS.

354
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:23,541
- I CAN'T TELL YOU
HOW HAPPY I AM

355
00:18:23,625 --> 00:18:25,625
TO HAVE SOMEONE
LIKE YOU AS A BROTHER.

356
00:18:25,708 --> 00:18:27,333
SO, WELCOME TO THE FAMILY.

357
00:18:27,416 --> 00:18:30,208
- THE PLEASURE'S MINE.
THANK YOU, DAEDALUS.

358
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,750
- Re-L:
GOD, HE'S SUCH A SMART ASS.

359
00:18:33,833 --> 00:18:35,958
- WELL I'M JUST GLAD
HE DIDN'T HATE ME.

360
00:18:36,041 --> 00:18:37,541
- I'VE NEVER MET
A SINGLE PERSON 

361
00:18:37,625 --> 00:18:39,291
WHO DIDN'T LIKE YOU.

362
00:18:39,375 --> 00:18:41,500
YOU'RE SO ADORED,
IT'S ALMOST SICKENING.

363
00:18:41,583 --> 00:18:43,083
- OH, YOU'RE JEALOUS.

364
00:18:43,166 --> 00:18:44,791
- ( gasps )
THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEANT.

365
00:18:47,708 --> 00:18:51,083
- ( gasps )
- DAMN IT. 

366
00:18:51,166 --> 00:18:52,166
- NO, DON'T TOUCH IT.

367
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:53,958
- ( gasps )

368
00:18:59,416 --> 00:19:01,041
- IT'S ALREADY BEEN A WEEK,

369
00:19:01,125 --> 00:19:03,041
RE-L.

370
00:19:03,125 --> 00:19:04,666
- ( gasps )

371
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:08,000
- I DON'T KNOW
WHY I'M HERE. 

372
00:19:08,083 --> 00:19:09,333
- Swan: IT'S OKAY, RE-L.

373
00:19:09,416 --> 00:19:11,208
- Daedalus:
RE-L, THANK GOD.

374
00:19:11,291 --> 00:19:13,708
YOU WEREN'T AT HOME. I THOUGHT
SOMETHING MIGHT HAVE HAPPENED.

375
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:15,791
- ARE YOU CUTTING CLASS
AGAIN, DAEDALUS?

376
00:19:15,875 --> 00:19:17,583
- WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

377
00:19:17,666 --> 00:19:21,250
- WILL YOU SNAP OUT OF IT?
VINCENT LAW HAS ESCAPED.

378
00:19:21,333 --> 00:19:22,708
- ( gasps )

379
00:19:22,791 --> 00:19:24,916
- HE ESCAPED WITH THE HELP
OF A COGITO INFECTED

380
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
COMPANION TYPE AUTOREIV.

381
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:29,458
YOU SHOULD ASSUME HE'S
GOING TO COME AFTER YOU.

382
00:19:29,541 --> 00:19:32,625
JUST IN CASE,
YOU SHOULD HAVE THIS.

383
00:19:37,458 --> 00:19:39,333
AND SWAN,
TAKE CARE OF HER FOR ME.

384
00:19:41,458 --> 00:19:43,125
- YOU LET HIM GET AWAY,
VINCENT.

385
00:19:43,208 --> 00:19:45,708
- DID I?

386
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:47,125
I DON'T KNOW.

387
00:19:47,208 --> 00:19:50,000
- I TOLD YOU,
IT'S UNCONSCIOUS.

388
00:19:50,083 --> 00:19:52,125
- ( gasps )

389
00:19:52,208 --> 00:19:56,083
- RE-L, YOU REALLY
LOVED VINCENT, DIDN'T YOU?

390
00:19:56,166 --> 00:19:57,708
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
OF COURSE I DO.

391
00:19:57,791 --> 00:19:59,625
I MEAN,
VINCENT'S MY FIANCE.

392
00:19:59,708 --> 00:20:02,458
- VINCENT, YOU SEE THAT?

393
00:20:03,791 --> 00:20:06,166
WHAT YOU ARE DOING
IS CONFUSING YOUR DESIRES

394
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:07,625
WITH YOUR MEMORIES.

395
00:20:07,708 --> 00:20:09,833
THAT'S WHY RE-L
IS CONFUSED.

396
00:20:09,916 --> 00:20:12,041
YOU'VE LOST SIGHT OF
THE BOUNDARY BETWEEN

397
00:20:12,125 --> 00:20:14,625
FANTASY AND REALITY.

398
00:20:14,708 --> 00:20:16,708
ISN'T THAT RIGHT,
RE-L?

399
00:20:16,791 --> 00:20:19,958
- VINCENT IS TRYING 
TO FIND AND KILL ME.

400
00:20:20,041 --> 00:20:22,083
- VINCENT, WAIT.

401
00:20:22,166 --> 00:20:25,875
- WHAT DO I HAVE TO DO?

402
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:27,625
- YOU MUST KILL RE-L.

403
00:20:27,708 --> 00:20:28,875
- ( gasps )

404
00:20:28,958 --> 00:20:31,875
- YOU'RE A FRAGMENT 
OF HER SUBCONSCIOUS.

405
00:20:31,958 --> 00:20:34,000
RE-L CREATED YOU
TO ESCAPE THE FACT

406
00:20:34,083 --> 00:20:36,416
THAT SHE BETRAYED
VINCENT LAW.

407
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:38,625
THAT'S WHY
IF YOU KILL RE-L

408
00:20:38,708 --> 00:20:40,958
WITHIN THIS FANTASY
CONSTRUCTION,

409
00:20:41,041 --> 00:20:44,333
IT WILL SHOCK HER FRAGMENTED
PERSONALITY BACK TOGETHER.

410
00:20:44,416 --> 00:20:47,416
AND NOW,
BACK TO FANTASY.

411
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:48,666
- ( gasps )

412
00:21:03,541 --> 00:21:06,458
- VINCE!
I MISSED YOU.

413
00:21:06,541 --> 00:21:08,166
- PINO.

414
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:09,958
- HUH?

415
00:21:10,041 --> 00:21:12,333
VINCE, WHY ARE YOU
CARRYING THAT THING?

416
00:21:12,416 --> 00:21:13,791
- BECAUSE...

417
00:21:13,875 --> 00:21:16,791
I HAVE TO KILL RE-L.
- HUH?

418
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:18,458
- IT'S SO I CAN HELP HER.

419
00:21:18,541 --> 00:21:20,958
- THEN IT'S SO YOU CAN
HELP RE-L?

420
00:21:21,041 --> 00:21:22,458
- ( sighs )
YEAH.

421
00:21:22,541 --> 00:21:24,250
- SO IT'S OKAY
TO KILL RE-L

422
00:21:24,333 --> 00:21:26,791
IF IT'S BECAUSE
YOU HAVE TO HELP HER?

423
00:21:26,875 --> 00:21:28,458
- UH, YEAH.

424
00:21:28,541 --> 00:21:30,375
IT'S BECAUSE
THIS ISN'T REAL.

425
00:21:30,458 --> 00:21:31,666
- HUH?

426
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:33,000
- I DON'T KNOW
HOW TO EXPLAIN IT

427
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:35,125
SO YOU'D UNDERSTAND.

428
00:21:35,208 --> 00:21:38,791
- OKAY. THEN WHY DON'T
WE BOTH GO KILL RE-L?

429
00:21:38,875 --> 00:21:39,875
- HUH?

430
00:21:42,833 --> 00:21:44,166
HEY, PINO.

431
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:46,166
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

432
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:47,500
- EVEN IF YOU HADN'T ASKED,

433
00:21:47,583 --> 00:21:49,833
I WOULD HAVE BEEN 
HAPPY TO KILL HER.

434
00:21:49,916 --> 00:21:52,833
- Swan:
THIS ISN'T REAL.

435
00:21:52,916 --> 00:21:54,166
- SWAN.

436
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:56,875
- WE'RE STILL INSIDE
RE-L'S IMAGINATION.

437
00:21:56,958 --> 00:22:02,291
THAT'S WHY THE OTHER YOU
HAS TO KILL RE-L.

438
00:22:02,375 --> 00:22:03,958
KILL HER.

439
00:22:04,041 --> 00:22:05,791
KILL HER.

440
00:22:05,875 --> 00:22:07,458
KILL HER!

441
00:22:08,625 --> 00:22:10,541
- NO.
- ( gasps )

442
00:22:10,625 --> 00:22:13,333
- I SHOULD HAVE
NOTICED IT SOONER.

443
00:22:13,416 --> 00:22:14,958
THIS IS MY PENDANT.

444
00:22:15,041 --> 00:22:17,708
AND I WOULD NEVER GIVE IT UP,
NOT EVEN TO RE-L.

445
00:22:17,791 --> 00:22:21,083
THE MOMENT RE-L TOOK IT,
EVERYTHING BECAME A LIE.

446
00:22:21,166 --> 00:22:23,791
THIS WORLD COULD NEVER
EXIST IN THE FIRST PLACE.

447
00:22:25,916 --> 00:22:28,458
- FINE.  THEN WHAT 
ARE YOU DOING HERE?

448
00:22:28,541 --> 00:22:31,541
- ( gasps )
- Swan: IF THIS PLACE IS FALSE,

449
00:22:31,625 --> 00:22:33,041
I WONDER WHAT
THAT MAKES YOU.

450
00:22:33,125 --> 00:22:34,875
YOU'RE HERE IN THIS PLACE,

451
00:22:34,958 --> 00:22:38,208
OR DO YOU DENY
EVEN THAT?

452
00:22:38,291 --> 00:22:40,875
YOU'VE LOST SIGHT OF
YOUR OWN SENSE OF SELF.

453
00:22:40,958 --> 00:22:43,833
THAT'S WHY YOU'LL NEVER
FIND A PLACE TO BELONG.

454
00:22:43,916 --> 00:22:46,125
RIGHT, VINCENT?

455
00:22:46,208 --> 00:22:49,208
- THIS PLACE,
IT'S NOT RIGHT.

456
00:22:49,291 --> 00:22:50,875
I DON'T BELONG HERE.

457
00:22:50,958 --> 00:22:52,291
- DAMN YOU.
- ( gasps )

458
00:22:52,375 --> 00:22:55,541
- WHY WON'T YOU JUST
TAKE THAT THING OFF?

459
00:22:55,625 --> 00:22:58,875
JUST TAKE OFF
THE PENDANT. 

460
00:22:58,958 --> 00:23:00,541
- YOU'RE A PROXY TOO.

461
00:23:00,625 --> 00:23:04,458
- I CAN'T STAND MEN WHO HAVE
THE STINK OF OTHER WOMEN.

462
00:23:04,541 --> 00:23:06,833
AND I'M SURE SHE THINKS
THE SAME THING.

463
00:23:08,333 --> 00:23:11,583
- EVEN IF THAT'S TRUE,
I'LL STILL PROTECT RE-L.

464
00:23:11,666 --> 00:23:12,583
- I SEE.

465
00:23:12,666 --> 00:23:13,750
- ( growls )

466
00:23:17,375 --> 00:23:19,333
- NO!  RE-L, STOP.

467
00:23:19,416 --> 00:23:20,833
- TAKE CARE.

468
00:23:20,916 --> 00:23:23,500
- AAH!

469
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,458
- VINCENT.
- ( gasps )

470
00:23:42,541 --> 00:23:44,583
- IT'S MY TURN.

471
00:23:44,666 --> 00:23:46,583
WHAT'S WRONG?
