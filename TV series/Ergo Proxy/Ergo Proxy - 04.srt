1
00:00:51,083 --> 00:00:53,708
- EVERYTHING IN HERE
IS UNNATURAL.

2
00:00:53,791 --> 00:00:57,791
A MAN LIVING INSIDE
AN EMPTY ROOM.

3
00:01:01,625 --> 00:01:04,666
VINCENT LAW.

4
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:07,166
WHAT DID HE THINK ABOUT
IN HERE?

5
00:01:12,666 --> 00:01:15,458
WHAT WAS IT
HE WAS LOOKING FOR

6
00:01:15,541 --> 00:01:18,083
THAT HE WAS WILLING TO DIE?

7
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:46,166
IS THIS ALL HE HAD
TO SHOW FOR IT?

8
00:01:48,583 --> 00:01:52,083
- YOU LIAR! ( echoes )

9
00:01:53,291 --> 00:01:56,000
- YOU WERE JUST AN IMMIGRANT,

10
00:01:56,083 --> 00:01:59,000
BUT WHO THE HELL
WERE YOU REALLY?

11
00:02:03,083 --> 00:02:06,958
( sighs ) LOOKS LIKE THIS
INVESTIGATION IS GOING NOWHERE

12
00:02:07,041 --> 00:02:08,000
WITHOUT IGGY.

13
00:02:18,166 --> 00:02:21,875
"PROJECTED ESCAPE ROUTE
FOR INFECTED AUTOREIVS."

14
00:02:23,625 --> 00:02:26,041
WHY DID HE HAVE IT?

HEY, LET'S NOT DO THAT.

00:04:21,666 --> 00:04:23,500
- Vincent: WHO ARE YOU?

31
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:28,500
- Pino: IT'S THIS WAY.

( laughs )

33
00:04:32,833 --> 00:04:36,791
- Man: "NOTHING THERE WAS
A TOWN OR A CHURCH

OR A RIVER OR A COLOR

OR A LIGHT OR A SHADOW."

36
00:04:45,708 --> 00:04:48,416
- IMMIGRATION I.D.

37
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,416
IN THE END,
IT DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING.

38
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:53,083
- Vincent: WHAT IS THIS?
WHO ARE YOU?

39
00:04:53,166 --> 00:04:56,208
- THAT'S THE ONE.
YES, THAT'S RIGHT.

40
00:04:56,291 --> 00:04:59,083
YOU'RE A SMART ONE,
AREN'T YOU, PINO?

41
00:04:59,166 --> 00:05:02,083
- Vincent: PINO.

42
00:05:05,125 --> 00:05:07,125
IT SURE IS HOT IN HERE.

43
00:05:07,208 --> 00:05:10,125
DOROTHY, COULD YOU TURN
ON THE AIR CONDITIONER?

44
00:05:16,875 --> 00:05:18,625
HUH?
- ( Pino laughs )

45
00:05:27,958 --> 00:05:30,333
- YOU'RE HER.

46
00:05:30,416 --> 00:05:32,833
THE INFECTED AUTOREIV.

47
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:34,291
- ( laughing )

00:05:45,208 --> 00:05:47,875
- Man:
"I KEPT STILL FOR A WHILE.

"IT WAS JUST A DREAM."

- IT'S NOT ME.

- AFTER ALL,
AN IMMIGRANT IS AN IMMIGRANT.

56

- ( screams )

57
00:06:38,458 --> 00:06:40,833
- I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

58
00:06:40,916 --> 00:06:43,333
HE'S BY HIMSELF.

59
00:06:48,333 --> 00:06:51,333
- Vincent:
MAN, WHAT AN AWFUL DREAM.

60
00:06:51,416 --> 00:06:53,125
THE SECURITY BUREAU
MISTAKENLY THOUGHT

61
00:06:53,208 --> 00:06:55,000
I WAS THE ONE
WHO MURDERED YOU.

62
00:06:55,083 --> 00:06:57,875
A PRETTY STUPID NIGHTMARE,
HUH, DOROTHY?

63
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:02,791
CAN YOU IMAGINE ME DOING--

64
00:07:12,583 --> 00:07:15,833
- STOP RELYING SO HEAVILY
ON YOUR ENTOURAGE.

65
00:07:15,916 --> 00:07:17,625
DOROTHY ISN'T HERE.

66
00:07:17,708 --> 00:07:21,375
YOU'LL NEVER BECOME
A FELLOW CITIZEN NOW.

67
00:07:27,625 --> 00:07:31,333
- Man: "I DON'T KNOW WHAT
HAPPENED INSIDE MY MIND.

68
00:07:31,416 --> 00:07:34,875
NOR DO I HAVE ANY WAY
OF PUTTING IT INTO WORDS."

69
00:07:34,958 --> 00:07:37,666
- I TRIED--

70
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:40,250
I TRIED HARD
TO DO MY BEST,

71
00:07:40,333 --> 00:07:42,708
TO BECOME A FELLOW CITIZEN.

72
00:07:42,791 --> 00:07:45,500
SO I COULD BECOME A PART
OF--

73
00:07:45,583 --> 00:07:49,083
I--

74
00:07:49,166 --> 00:07:51,791
- YOU CRIMINAL.
VINCENT LAW.

75
00:07:51,875 --> 00:07:53,583
- IT'S NOT ME!

76
00:07:57,125 --> 00:08:00,666
- Re-l:
THAT'S WHAT REALLY HAPPENED.

77
00:08:05,833 --> 00:08:08,791
- Vincent: HELP ME.

78
00:08:08,875 --> 00:08:12,750
- "IT WAS A MOMENT
THAT DEFIED ALL WORDS.

79
00:08:12,833 --> 00:08:15,208
WHEN I FELT SOMETHING

80
00:08:15,291 --> 00:08:19,000
INSIDE ME FALL ASLEEP

81
00:08:19,083 --> 00:08:22,833
AND SOMETHING ELSE WAKE UP."

82
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:46,583
"IN THE WORLD THAT WAS
BORN FROM HIM,

83
00:08:46,666 --> 00:08:49,916
A PERSON COULD NOW
BECOME ANYTHING."

84
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,166
THE WORDS OF JOE BOUSQUET.
- Vincent: WHO IS THAT?

85
00:08:55,291 --> 00:08:58,125
- JOE BOUSQUET.
- JOE.

86
00:08:58,208 --> 00:09:01,750
- YOU'RE VINCENT LAW,
AREN'T YOU?

87
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:04,041
- WHERE AM I?

88
00:09:04,125 --> 00:09:06,083
- THERE'S NOTHING
TO WORRY ABOUT.

89
00:09:06,166 --> 00:09:08,208
YOUR BODY FOUGHT OFF
THE VIRUS.

90
00:09:08,291 --> 00:09:11,666
WELL, THANKS IN PART
TO MY TREATMENT, THAT IS.

91
00:09:14,333 --> 00:09:17,291
EIGHTY PERCENT OF THE PEOPLE
WHO COME HERE BECOME INFECTED

92
00:09:17,375 --> 00:09:20,250
WITH THE DISEASE
AND DON'T SURVIVE A WEEK.

93
00:09:20,333 --> 00:09:23,125
- INFECTED.

94
00:09:23,208 --> 00:09:26,291
- YES, YOU'VE BEEN ASLEEP
FOR TEN DAYS.

95
00:09:26,375 --> 00:09:28,250
BUT YOU'RE ALL RIGHT NOW.

96
00:09:28,333 --> 00:09:30,875
- TEN DAYS.

97
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:34,000
- DURING WHICH TIME PINO
TOLD ME ABOUT YOU.

98
00:09:34,083 --> 00:09:37,041
QUITE A STORY.
- ( door opens )

99
00:09:37,125 --> 00:09:41,250
- HELLO, PINO.  GOOD NEWS.
VINCENT IS AWAKE.

100
00:09:41,333 --> 00:09:44,250
- VINCE, GOOD MORNING.

101
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:47,416
THANK GOODNESS.

102
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:48,500
VINCE.

103
00:09:50,333 --> 00:09:53,208
- PINO.

104
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:59,250
- THE AUTOREIV ESCAPE ROUTE.

105
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,291
MY GOD.

106
00:10:16,375 --> 00:10:19,708
THOSE GUYS AT THE SECURITY
BUREAU COULD NEVER FIND THIS.

107
00:10:37,791 --> 00:10:41,250
- EXCUSE ME.  JOE.

108
00:10:42,625 --> 00:10:45,625
- JOE?
- JOE.

109
00:10:47,833 --> 00:10:49,500
- JOE.

110
00:10:49,583 --> 00:10:52,416
( laughing )

111
00:10:54,291 --> 00:10:57,000
JOE.

112
00:10:57,083 --> 00:11:00,750
NO, NO, I APOLOGIZE.

113
00:11:00,833 --> 00:11:03,541
ACTUALLY, MY NAME IS HOODY.

114
00:11:03,625 --> 00:11:05,750
JOE'S A POET FROM CARCASSONNE.

115
00:11:05,833 --> 00:11:08,583
( laughing )

116
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,083
- WHY ARE YOU BEING
SO KIND TO ME?

117
00:11:26,166 --> 00:11:29,083
IT MUST HAVE BEEN TROUBLE
FOR YOU WATCHING OVER ME 

118
00:11:29,166 --> 00:11:31,541
FOR TEN DAYS.

119
00:11:31,625 --> 00:11:33,166
- THERE ONCE WAS A TIME

120
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:36,458
WHEN OUR GROUP ENJOYED THE KIND
PROTECTION OF THAT PLACE

121
00:11:36,541 --> 00:11:38,291
INSIDE THE DOME.

122
00:11:44,708 --> 00:11:48,916
- THE WHOLE CITY IS ALL JUST
ONE BIG FAT ROTTEN LIE.

123
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,458
- UNTIL YOU KNOW THAT A LIE IS
A LIE, THEN IT'S THE TRUTH.

124
00:11:52,541 --> 00:11:54,541
LEARNING HOW TO DISCERN
THE TRUTH FROM THE LIE

125
00:11:54,625 --> 00:11:56,291
MAY BE THE RIGHT THING TO DO,

126
00:11:56,375 --> 00:11:59,583
BUT KNOWING THE TRUTH WON'T
ALWAYS MAKE YOU HAPPY.

127
00:11:59,666 --> 00:12:03,583
- LIES MAKE US HAPPY.
LIES MAKE US HAPPY?

128
00:12:03,666 --> 00:12:08,416
- THAT'S ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.
YOU'RE A CLEVER CHILD, PINO.

129
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:11,208
LET'S HAVE A GOOD LOOK.
IT'S AMAZING.

130
00:12:11,291 --> 00:12:14,583
AUTOREIVS REALLY DO SEEM TO BE
BECOMING MORE AND MORE LIKE US.

131
00:12:14,666 --> 00:12:19,041
I BET EVERYONE HAS THESE TYPES
OVER THERE NOWADAYS, RIGHT?

132
00:12:19,125 --> 00:12:21,958
- OVER THERE?
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

133
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:25,291
- I'M TALKING ABOUT ROMDEAU.

134
00:12:25,375 --> 00:12:28,958
ROMDEAU.  SAYING IT MAKES
ME FEEL NOSTALGIC.

135
00:12:29,041 --> 00:12:32,250
- WAIT A MINUTE.  WE'RE NOT
IN THE IMMIGRANT DISTRICT?

136
00:12:38,166 --> 00:12:41,208
HOW IS IT THAT
I'M STILL ALIVE?

137
00:12:41,291 --> 00:12:44,166
- IT TOOK YOU LONG ENOUGH.
ISN'T IT OBVIOUS?

138
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:47,958
YOU MANAGED TO ESCAPE OUTSIDE
THE DOME WITH PINO.

139
00:12:48,041 --> 00:12:49,958
- OUTSIDE THE DOME?

140
00:12:50,041 --> 00:12:53,166
- OH, I KNOW.  I KNOW.
PINO KNOWS THE ANSWER.

141
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:58,125
THE DISTANCE FROM HERE
TO THE DOME IS 1246.65 UNITS.

142
00:12:58,208 --> 00:13:00,500
AND THE HEIGHT FROM
THE PLUG VENT VINCE LEAPT FROM

143
00:13:00,583 --> 00:13:02,875
ALL THE WAY DOWN
TO THE EARTH'S SURFACE

144
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:05,916
IS APPROXIMATELY 517 UNITS.

145
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,416
I KNOW A LOT BECAUSE I
SEE ALL SORTS OF THINGS

146
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:12,166
AND ASK EVERYONE ABOUT IT.
I'M AMAZING.

147
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:15,666
DON'T YOU THINK SO, VINCE?
HMM?

148
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:17,375
VINCE?

149
00:13:21,958 --> 00:13:24,916
- OUTSIDE ROMDEAU.

150
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,916
- ( gasps ) VINCE, NO!

151
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,833
- YOU DON'T LOOK WELL.

152
00:14:01,916 --> 00:14:06,041
I WONDER IF MAYBE IT'S FROM
THE WOUNDS WE TREATED EARLIER.

153
00:14:06,125 --> 00:14:08,250
IS IT BECAUSE THE ADMINISTRATORS
DISCIPLINED YOU?

154
00:14:08,333 --> 00:14:12,208
I HEARD THEY CONFISCATED IGGY.
THAT MUST BE HORRIBLE.

155
00:14:12,291 --> 00:14:15,083
- YES, BUT THAT'S NOT IT.

156
00:14:15,166 --> 00:14:17,875
- SO THEN WHAT IS IT?

157
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:29,458
WON'T YOU TELL ME?

158
00:14:29,541 --> 00:14:33,041
- I CAN'T.
I CAN'T SAY ANYTHING.

159
00:14:33,125 --> 00:14:36,625
- OH.  IT'S DELEUZE
AND GUATTARI, RIGHT?

160
00:14:36,708 --> 00:14:38,416
YOU DON'T HAVE TO
WORRY ABOUT THEM.

161
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:40,541
THE TRUTH IS
I'VE ALTERED THEM A BIT.

162
00:14:40,625 --> 00:14:43,458
NO ONE'S GOING TO HEAR
A WORD OF WHAT YOU SAY.

163
00:14:43,541 --> 00:14:46,083
- BUT WHAT ABOUT
IF MY GRANDFATHER--

164
00:14:46,166 --> 00:14:49,083
- IT'S JUST BETWEEN
YOU AND ME.

165
00:14:49,166 --> 00:14:52,333
I'VE ALWAYS BEEN
ON YOUR SIDE, RE-L,

166
00:14:52,416 --> 00:14:54,625
EVEN BEFORE
I WAS YOUR DOCTOR.

167
00:14:54,708 --> 00:14:56,666
YOU DO BELIEVE ME,

168
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:59,583
DON'T YOU, RE-L?

169
00:14:59,666 --> 00:15:02,583
- YOU WON'T TELL ANYONE
ABOUT THIS?

170
00:15:02,666 --> 00:15:04,083
- I WON'T.

171
00:15:04,166 --> 00:15:07,083
- I FOUND WHERE IT IS.

172
00:15:07,166 --> 00:15:09,791
THE DEAD BODY
OF THE PROXY.

173
00:15:09,875 --> 00:15:12,833
THE SECURITY BUREAU STILL
DOESN'T EVEN KNOW.

174
00:15:12,916 --> 00:15:15,125
IT'S THE MONSTER THAT RAUL
AND HIS PEOPLE HAVE BEEN

175
00:15:15,208 --> 00:15:17,833
SEARCHING FOR WHILE KEEPING IT
SECRET FROM THE BUREAU.

176
00:15:19,666 --> 00:15:21,125
I NEED A FAVOR.

177
00:15:21,208 --> 00:15:22,958
EXAMINE IT
AND TELL ME WHAT IT IS.

178
00:15:24,791 --> 00:15:27,000
MY GRANDFATHER'S IN
ON ALL OF THIS.

179
00:15:27,083 --> 00:15:30,250
I NEED TO KNOW FOR MYSELF
WHAT THAT THING IS.

180
00:15:30,333 --> 00:15:32,500
- EVEN IF I DO WHAT
YOU ASK OF ME,

181
00:15:32,583 --> 00:15:35,250
YOU MAY NOT LIKE THE TRUTH--
- I DON'T CARE.

182
00:15:35,333 --> 00:15:39,041
I'M BEGGING YOU, DAEDALUS.

183
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:44,041
- ( sighs )
ALL RIGHT, YOU WIN.

184
00:15:44,125 --> 00:15:46,916
I'LL DO IT ONLY
BECAUSE YOU ASKED ME TO.

185
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,208
CAN YOU TELL ME WHERE IT IS?

186
00:16:06,708 --> 00:16:08,916
- I DON'T KNOW HOW,

187
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,666
BUT I KNOW I CAME FROM THERE.

188
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:14,250
I WAS CHASED BY A MONSTER.

189
00:16:14,333 --> 00:16:17,791
FALSELY ACCUSED OF A CRIME
AND DECLARED A TRAITOR.

190
00:16:17,875 --> 00:16:20,041
- A MONSTER?

191
00:16:20,125 --> 00:16:23,041
DID YOU ACTUALLY SEE IT?

192
00:16:23,125 --> 00:16:26,875
- WHAT?
YOU KNOW ABOUT IT?

193
00:16:26,958 --> 00:16:28,791
- THOSE THINGS--

194
00:16:31,375 --> 00:16:34,041
THOSE THINGS ARE DEMONS

195
00:16:34,125 --> 00:16:36,375
BORN FROM THE ANGRY EARTH.

196
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:51,791
- THE AMRITA CELLS APPEAR
TO BE COMPLETELY WIPED OUT,

197
00:16:51,875 --> 00:16:53,708
BUT THEY'RE INDESTRUCTIBLE.
- Re-l: WHAT DO YOU THINK?

198
00:16:53,791 --> 00:16:56,000
- WELL, I--

199
00:16:56,083 --> 00:16:57,125
I WON'T KNOW MUCH

200
00:16:57,208 --> 00:16:58,875
UNTIL WE TAKE IT BACK
TO THE LAB,

201
00:16:58,958 --> 00:17:02,791
TO BE SURE.
- YOU KNEW.

202
00:17:04,875 --> 00:17:07,666
- YOU'D BEST FORGET ABOUT
EVERYTHING YOU SAW HERE

203
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:09,250
FOR YOUR OWN SAFETY.

204
00:17:09,333 --> 00:17:11,791
- THIS IS A PROXY, ISN'T IT?

205
00:17:11,875 --> 00:17:16,583
AND THERE'S STILL
A SECOND PROXY ALIVE OUT THERE.

206
00:17:16,666 --> 00:17:18,625
THE MONSTER THAT KILLED
THIS ONE.

207
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:25,041
IT MUST STILL BE ALIVE
IN HERE SOMEWHERE.

208
00:17:25,125 --> 00:17:27,083
WE NEED TO FIND IT.
- RE-L.

209
00:17:27,166 --> 00:17:30,791
- YOU KNOW ABOUT IT,
DON'T YOU, DAEDALUS?

210
00:17:30,875 --> 00:17:34,041
I'M SORRY. I KNOW IT'S SOMETHING
YOU CAN'T TALK ABOUT.

211
00:17:34,125 --> 00:17:36,833
- NO, THAT'S NOT IT.
- NO, IT'S ALL RIGHT, DAEDALUS.

212
00:17:36,916 --> 00:17:39,125
LOOKS LIKE I MAY WELL HAVE
GOTTEN YOU

213
00:17:39,208 --> 00:17:41,583
INTO SOME SORT OF TROUBLE.

214
00:17:41,666 --> 00:17:45,083
- I WANT YOU TO TRUST ME
AND LET ME HANDLE THE REST.

215
00:17:45,166 --> 00:17:47,333
JUST PROMISE ME
ONLY ONE THING.

216
00:17:47,416 --> 00:17:51,041
YOU MUST TELL NOBODY
WHAT YOU FOUND HERE.

217
00:17:51,125 --> 00:17:53,125
- HUH?
WHAT DID I FIND HERE?

218
00:17:53,208 --> 00:17:55,541
IN FACT,
I'VE NEVER EVEN BEEN HERE.

219
00:17:55,625 --> 00:17:58,041
- THAT IS PERFECT.

220
00:17:58,125 --> 00:17:59,791
- WELL, I'LL LEAVE THE REST
TO YOU THEN.

221
00:17:59,875 --> 00:18:02,541
WHY DON'T YOU FILE THE RESULTS
AWAY FOR ME WHEN YOU KNOW THEM?

222
00:18:02,625 --> 00:18:04,541
I'LL COME BY TO PICK THEM UP.

223
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:06,791
- WHERE ARE YOU--

224
00:18:06,875 --> 00:18:10,291
- I TOLD YOU, DIDN'T I?
I WANNA LOOK INTO THIS MYSELF.

225
00:18:10,375 --> 00:18:13,500
THERE'S A SECRET PATH HERE
THAT ONLY THE INFECTED AUTOREIVS

226
00:18:13,583 --> 00:18:16,833
KNOW ABOUT.
I'M GONNA TO TRY TO FIND IT.

227
00:18:16,916 --> 00:18:19,208
- RE-L.

228
00:18:35,166 --> 00:18:38,208
- SO YOU'RE AN IMMIGRANT.

229
00:18:38,291 --> 00:18:41,125
I GUESS THE ROMDEAU AIR
DIDN'T AGREE WITH YOU, RIGHT?

230
00:18:41,208 --> 00:18:43,833
I KNOW THE FEELING.
- IN THAT CASE, WELCOME.

231
00:18:43,916 --> 00:18:46,333
YOU CAN STAY HERE AS LONG
AS YOU LIKE.

232
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:48,416
- THIS LAND IS WHERE
YOU'RE FREE.

233
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:51,333
IN EXCHANGE FOR LEAVING THE
DOME, WE GAINED TRUE FREEDOM.

234
00:18:54,458 --> 00:18:56,000
- WHAT'S THAT?

235
00:18:56,083 --> 00:18:58,750
- THEY THROW OUT THE THINGS THEY
DON'T NEED ANYMORE IN THE DOME.

236
00:18:58,833 --> 00:19:01,500
BUT MOST ALL OF IT IS STILL
PERFECTLY USABLE.

237
00:19:01,583 --> 00:19:03,125
- Pino: I FOUND THIS, TOO.

238
00:19:03,208 --> 00:19:06,625
( playing tune )

239
00:19:06,708 --> 00:19:08,583
- ( laughing )

240
00:19:17,291 --> 00:19:19,875
- THE PEOPLE LIVING HERE EITHER
LEFT ROMDEAU ON THEIR OWN

241
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:22,541
OR WERE BANISHED FROM THE TOWN
FOR VARIOUS REASONS.

242
00:19:22,625 --> 00:19:26,958
THAT'S WHY A LOT THEM FEEL
HOSTILE TOWARDS THE PLACE.

243
00:19:27,041 --> 00:19:29,791
WHICH ISN'T TO SAY THERE AREN'T
SOME OF US WHO WOULD LIKE

244
00:19:29,875 --> 00:19:32,458
TO RETURN.
- BUT SHE TOLD ME

245
00:19:32,541 --> 00:19:33,958
THAT YOU CAN'T GO BACK
FOREVER.

246
00:19:34,041 --> 00:19:35,708
- WHO SAYS WE CAN'T GO BACK?

247
00:19:35,791 --> 00:19:38,583
- THE WOMAN THAT I MET BEFORE
OVER THERE.

248
00:19:38,666 --> 00:19:40,916
- I WONDER IF
SHE MEANS THAT BITCH QUINN.

249
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,083
- SPEAKING OF WHICH,
DIDN'T THE OLD MAN SAY

250
00:19:44,166 --> 00:19:46,208
THIS THING WAS THE LATEST
HIGH-END MODEL?

251
00:19:46,291 --> 00:19:49,541
- I BET SOME HIGH-LEVEL CITIZENS
MUST HAVE OWNED HER.

252
00:19:49,625 --> 00:19:52,833
THEY MIGHT COME LOOKING
FOR THEIR LOST POSSESSION.

253
00:19:52,916 --> 00:19:54,291
RIGHT, YOUNG LADY?

254
00:19:55,625 --> 00:19:58,166
- VINCE!

255
00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:01,666
- ( laughs ) I'M KIDDING.

256
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:05,416
WHO WOULD EVER WANT TO GO
BACK TO THAT PLACE, RIGHT?

257
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:08,666
- YOU CAN SAY THAT AGAIN.
- YOU CAN SAY THAT AGAIN.

258
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:10,083
- ( laughing )

259
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:14,833
- YOU CAN SAY THAT AGAIN.

260
00:20:14,916 --> 00:20:17,416
YOU CAN SAY THAT AGAIN!
- ( all laughing )

261
00:20:19,541 --> 00:20:21,333
- ( sighs )

262
00:20:27,416 --> 00:20:31,125
( sighs ) NOW WHAT DO I DO?

263
00:20:33,083 --> 00:20:36,083
- Woman:
SO YOU'RE PINO'S COMPANION?

264
00:20:39,541 --> 00:20:41,125
I'M QUINN.

265
00:20:41,208 --> 00:20:44,458
AS YOU CAN SEE, I PICK UP THINGS
THAT FALL IN THE SEA.

266
00:20:44,541 --> 00:20:46,750
IT'S A GOOD SPOT THAT
FEW PEOPLE KNOW ABOUT,

267
00:20:46,833 --> 00:20:49,375
AND THE BAY'S WARM FROM
THE HEAT CAUSED BY THE WASTE.

268
00:20:49,458 --> 00:20:52,083
- HEY, THAT'S A--
- OH, YOU RECOGNIZE IT?

269
00:20:52,166 --> 00:20:54,291
IT'S AN AUTOREIV'S
CENTRAL SYSTEM.

270
00:20:54,375 --> 00:20:56,625
IT'S WATERPROOF SO IT CAN SERVE

271
00:20:56,708 --> 00:20:58,458
AS THE RABBIT'S
TRANSMISSION SYSTEM.

272
00:20:58,541 --> 00:21:00,416
- RABBIT?
- YEP.

273
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:02,625
I'M NOT LIKE THE REST
OF THESE COWARDS

274
00:21:02,708 --> 00:21:06,083
WHO'S GONNA STAY HERE FOREVER.

275
00:21:06,166 --> 00:21:07,791
YOU MUST THINK I'VE GOT
A LOT OF NERVE

276
00:21:07,875 --> 00:21:09,541
SPEAKING SO BADLY OF OTHERS

277
00:21:09,625 --> 00:21:11,916
WHEN WE'VE JUST MET.
- I DON'T THINK THAT.

278
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,875
- WELL, YOU MAY HAVE
HEARD THIS FROM HOODY,

279
00:21:13,958 --> 00:21:15,916
BUT I PASS FOR BEING A BIT
OF AN ODDBALL,

280
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,916
BUT IF YOU ASK ME,
THE BIGGER ODDBALLS

281
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,208
ARE FAR AND AWAY
HOODY AND HIS GROUP.

282
00:21:22,291 --> 00:21:25,541
ALWAYS RANTING ABOUT
HOW FREE THEY ARE.

283
00:21:25,625 --> 00:21:27,458
- ( chuckles )

284
00:21:27,541 --> 00:21:29,500
- WELL, I DON'T PLAN
ON BEING A PARASITE

285
00:21:29,583 --> 00:21:31,750
AND LIVING OFF THE SCRAPS
OF THE DOME LIKE THIS

286
00:21:31,833 --> 00:21:34,916
FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE,
YOU BETTER BELIEVE IT.

287
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,541
- YEAH.
- SO WHAT'S YOUR STORY?

288
00:21:37,625 --> 00:21:39,708
- HUH?
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE

289
00:21:39,791 --> 00:21:42,791
CLUTCHING YOUR KNEES
AND WHIMPERING LIKE AN IDIOT?

290
00:21:42,875 --> 00:21:44,166
- NOTHING REALLY.

291
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:46,375
- PINO SEEMS A LOT MORE
GROWN UP THAN YOU.

292
00:21:46,458 --> 00:21:48,458
- THAT MAY BE TRUE.

293
00:21:48,541 --> 00:21:52,375
- YOU'LL GET USED TO LIVING OUT
HERE BEFORE TOO LONG.

294
00:21:52,458 --> 00:21:54,500
IN THE MEANTIME, YOU CAN THINK
ABOUT WHAT YOU WANT TO DO

295
00:21:54,583 --> 00:21:56,708
WITH YOURSELF.  OH, SHIT!

296
00:21:56,791 --> 00:21:59,708
WE GOTTA GET OUT OF HERE.
- WHAT IS IT?

297
00:21:59,791 --> 00:22:02,958
- IT'S A ROUTINE PATROL.
COME ON, HURRY!

298
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:17,875
- ROUTINE PATROL?
- A ROMDEAU UNMANNED

299
00:22:17,958 --> 00:22:20,875
SPY AIRCRAFT,
VERY METICULOUS.

300
00:22:20,958 --> 00:22:23,541
IT FOLLOWS A FIXED COURSE
AT A SET TIME EVERY DAY.

301
00:22:23,625 --> 00:22:26,083
AS LONG AS IT DETECTS
NOTHING UNUSUAL,

302
00:22:26,166 --> 00:22:27,916
IT WON'T GO LOOKING
FOR US.

303
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,041
AS FAR AS ROMDEAU'S CONCERNED,
THAT'S ALL WE ARE TO THEM.

304
00:22:31,125 --> 00:22:34,416
NOTHING UNUSUAL.
- PINO, HEY, YOU IDIOT!

305
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:37,500
- WAIT,
THEY CAN'T DETECT AUTOREIVS.

306
00:23:00,333 --> 00:23:02,458
- Vincent: PINO, GET DOWN!
- HUH?

307
00:23:16,291 --> 00:23:19,666
- HEY, I THOUGHT THE ROUTINE
PATROLS DIDN'T FIRE

308
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:21,458
AT AUTOREIVS.

309
00:23:35,375 --> 00:23:38,458
- IT'S THAT MAN.
- VINCENT LAW.

310
00:23:38,541 --> 00:23:40,041
WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO DO?

311
00:23:40,125 --> 00:23:42,125
- HOW CAN HE STILL
BE ALIVE?

312
00:23:42,208 --> 00:23:44,666
- SHALL I REPORT THIS
TO THE REGENT?

313
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:47,208
- NO.
I'M SURE HE'S NOT INTERESTED.

314
00:23:47,291 --> 00:23:50,083
RATHER, STRENGTHEN
THE PATROL CRAFT DEPLOYMENTS.

315
00:23:50,166 --> 00:23:53,583
- THEY'RE ALREADY STANDING BY.
- BEAUTIFUL.

316
00:23:53,666 --> 00:23:55,333
SEND THEM OUT.

317
00:23:55,416 --> 00:23:59,041
ISSUE A MOBILIZATION REQUEST
TO ALL BUREAUS CONCERNED.

318
00:23:59,125 --> 00:24:01,250
- BUT, CHIEF,
WE STILL HAVEN'T DETERMINED

319
00:24:01,333 --> 00:24:02,708
THE SPECIMEN'S WHEREABOUTS.

320
00:24:02,791 --> 00:24:05,750
- THAT IS TRUE,
BUT IRRELEVANT.

321
00:24:05,833 --> 00:24:08,833
EITHER WAY,
THAT IMMIGRANT HOLDS THE ANSWER.

322
00:24:08,916 --> 00:24:11,875
OF ALL THE THINGS I KNOW,
THAT IS CLEAR.

323
00:24:11,958 --> 00:24:13,791
- HOW UNUSUAL.
- HMM?

324
00:24:13,875 --> 00:24:18,375
- THE SURPRISINGLY EMOTIONAL
TONE OF YOUR WORDS.

325
00:24:18,458 --> 00:24:21,083
- I'M ACTUALLY SURPRISED MYSELF.

326
00:24:21,166 --> 00:24:23,041
( laughing )

327
00:24:23,125 --> 00:24:26,500
PERHAPS I WAS INFECTED
WITH THE COGITO VIRUS.

328
00:24:26,583 --> 00:24:29,375
- I DON'T FIND
THAT JOKE VERY AMUSING.

Re-l:
AN ANONYMOUS WHISPER.

337
00:26:04,208 --> 00:26:06,375
WHEN YOU CAN SEE THE UNSEEN,

338
00:26:06,458 --> 00:26:08,250
YOU CAN NO LONGER BE
YOUR FORMER SELF,

339
00:26:08,333 --> 00:26:10,125
BUT ANOTHER SELF.

340
00:26:10,208 --> 00:26:14,083
THAT'S ALL RIGHT,
AS LONG AS IT'S MY TRUE SELF.
