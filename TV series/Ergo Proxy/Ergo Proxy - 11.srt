- ( sighs )

2
00:00:49,791 --> 00:00:51,875
I GIVE UP.

3
00:00:51,958 --> 00:00:54,208
PINO?

4
00:00:54,291 --> 00:00:56,250
PINO?

5
00:01:05,875 --> 00:01:07,583
( sighs )

6
00:01:25,333 --> 00:01:28,291
OKAY, A BOOKSTORE.

7
00:01:36,083 --> 00:01:37,666
- ( door unlatches, creaks )

8
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:40,291
- HELLO?

9
00:01:40,375 --> 00:01:42,291
IS ANYBODY IN HERE?

10
00:01:49,791 --> 00:01:52,291
I AM REALLY LOST RIGHT NOW.

11
00:01:52,375 --> 00:01:54,333
HELLO?

12
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:06,000

- Man: WELCOME
TO THE CITY LIGHTS BOOKSTORE.

25
00:04:07,416 --> 00:04:09,000
YOU MUST BE TRAVELING.

26
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:11,666
WELL, ALL RIGHT,
COME WITH ME.

27
00:04:32,166 --> 00:04:35,500
LET'S JUST GIVE THE TEA
A BIT OF TIME TO STEEP,

28
00:04:35,583 --> 00:04:37,250
GET TO KNOW EACH OTHER.

29
00:04:37,333 --> 00:04:39,541
SOUND GOOD? 

30
00:04:39,625 --> 00:04:42,541
OKAY.
SO YOU'RE TRAVELING.

31
00:04:42,625 --> 00:04:46,041
- ACTUALLY, I THINK I'M LOST.

32
00:04:46,125 --> 00:04:49,416
- YEAH, I FIGURED.
WE GET THAT A LOT AROUND HERE.

33
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,416
- WITH THAT FOG--

34
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,666
- THAT REMINDS ME OF SOMETHING.

35
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:57,000
A MAN SAID THE FUTURE
IS AN OPAQUE MIRROR.

36
00:04:57,083 --> 00:04:59,458
ANYONE WHO TRIES
TO LOOK INTO IT SEES NOTHING

37
00:04:59,541 --> 00:05:02,875
BUT THE DIM OUTLINES
OF AN OLD AND WORRIED FACE.

38
00:05:02,958 --> 00:05:05,708
- MY SHIP--
IT'S RIGHT NEARBY.

39
00:05:05,791 --> 00:05:08,875
- THE ANSWERS YOU SEEK
YOU WILL NEVER FIND

40
00:05:08,958 --> 00:05:11,208
UNTIL YOU START
TO LOOK WITHIN YOURSELF.

41
00:05:11,291 --> 00:05:13,708
IT'S HOW IT WORKS
WITH THESE THINGS.

42
00:05:13,791 --> 00:05:17,041
- HAVE YOU SEEN A LITTLE-GIRL
TYPE AUTOREIV AROUND HERE?

43
00:05:17,125 --> 00:05:20,208
HER NAME IS PINO.
SHE'S ABOUT--

44
00:05:20,291 --> 00:05:22,208
- YOU'LL GET NOWHERE
IN A HURRY.

45
00:05:22,291 --> 00:05:24,041
TAKE THIS TEA FOR EXAMPLE.

46
00:05:24,125 --> 00:05:27,375
NOTHING THAT YOU DO
WILL MAKE IT STEEP ANY FASTER.

47
00:05:27,458 --> 00:05:30,958
YOU CAN'T JUST RUN AROUND
TRYING TO DO EVERYTHING AT ONCE.

48
00:05:31,041 --> 00:05:34,958
SO WHY NOT TAKE ADVANTAGE
OF THE BOOKSTORE?

49
00:05:35,041 --> 00:05:37,500
- YEAH.
SORRY FOR BEING IMPATIENT.

50
00:05:37,583 --> 00:05:40,541
I WAS JUST GOING
TO ASK YOU FOR DIRECTIONS.

51
00:05:43,125 --> 00:05:47,250
WELL, IT LOOKS LIKE YOU HAVE
A PRETTY IMPRESSIVE SHOP.

52
00:05:47,333 --> 00:05:49,958
I GUESS I'LL HAVE A LOOK,

53
00:05:50,041 --> 00:05:51,583
MAYBE FIND SOMETHING.

54
00:05:51,666 --> 00:05:53,916
- GO ON.
PULL A BOOK OFF THE SHELF

55
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,250
AND GIVE IT A ONCE-OVER.

56
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:10,250
- ( snaps )

57
00:06:16,041 --> 00:06:17,916
OH, DEAR, IT DOESN'T LOOK

58
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,458
LIKE THE POOR BOY'S
FIGURED IT OUT YET.

59
00:06:20,541 --> 00:06:24,458
WELL, WE'RE PERFORMING
ON A VERY SPECIAL STAGE.

60
00:06:24,541 --> 00:06:27,125
WE ARE,
IF YOU'LL PARDON THE EXPRESSION,

61
00:06:27,208 --> 00:06:29,708
IN THE THEATER
OF HIS MIND.

62
00:06:32,041 --> 00:06:34,625
CONSIDER THESE BOOKS.

63
00:06:34,708 --> 00:06:38,250
FOR THEM TO EXIST,
SOCIETY MUST EVOLVE

64
00:06:38,333 --> 00:06:40,333
TO AN APPROPRIATELY
ADVANCED STATE.

65
00:06:40,416 --> 00:06:42,791
BUT FOR A SOCIETY
TO EVOLVE,

66
00:06:42,875 --> 00:06:46,500
IT WOULD NEED THE LINGUISTIC
TOOLS THESE BOOKS CONTAIN.

67
00:06:51,625 --> 00:06:54,750
I KNOW-- A BIT OF
A CHICKEN-OR-THE-EGG DILEMMA,

68
00:06:54,833 --> 00:06:56,458
ISN'T IT?

69
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:59,333
EACH ONE'S CREATION
REQUIRES THE OTHER,

70
00:06:59,416 --> 00:07:01,000
SO WHICH CAME FIRST?

71
00:07:01,083 --> 00:07:03,583
IN THE FACE
OF SUCH A PARADOX,

72
00:07:03,666 --> 00:07:06,125
ONE COULD REASONABLY ARGUE
THAT LANGUAGE IS PERHAPS

73
00:07:06,208 --> 00:07:08,666
NOT ENTIRELY
A HUMAN INVENTION.

74
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:13,166
IS IT TOO FAR-FETCHED
TO IMAGINE GODLIKE CREATURES

75
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:15,708
BESTOWING MAN
WITH THE GIFT OF LANGUAGE?

76
00:07:15,791 --> 00:07:18,708
MMM, IT'S PROBABLY
A BIT FAR-FETCHED.

77
00:07:18,791 --> 00:07:22,916
IT WAS ROUSSEAU WHO FIRST
PUT FORWARD THIS ARGUMENT.

78
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,958
ALL RIGHT, THAT'S PROBABLY
ENOUGH PHILOSOPHY FOR NOW.

79
00:07:27,041 --> 00:07:29,041
TIME TO GET BACK
TO THE DISSECTION

80
00:07:29,125 --> 00:07:31,375
OF THIS YOUNG MAN'S
PAST AND FUTURE.

81
00:07:31,458 --> 00:07:34,375
WHO KNOWS WHAT TREASURES
WILL BE UNEARTHED BY THE--

82
00:07:34,458 --> 00:07:37,041
- Male voice:
--FICKLE HANDS OF FATE?

83
00:07:37,125 --> 00:07:39,166
( chuckling )

84
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:41,791
- ( snaps )
- WHY IS MY NAME ON THE COVER?

85
00:07:44,541 --> 00:07:46,958
WHERE'D YOU GO?

86
00:07:56,083 --> 00:07:58,583
WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?

87
00:08:01,125 --> 00:08:02,708
NO, THEY'RE ALL--

88
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:16,333
I'M DREAMING.

89
00:08:16,416 --> 00:08:20,083
- Male voice: THIS IS NOT
A DREAM, VINCENT LAW.

90
00:08:21,958 --> 00:08:23,875
COME, OVER HERE.

91
00:08:23,958 --> 00:08:26,625
- WHO'S THERE?!

92
00:08:26,708 --> 00:08:29,125
DOROTHY.

93
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:31,250
- Male voice:
I AM NOBODY.

94
00:08:31,333 --> 00:08:33,250
EVEN IF I WAS SOMEBODY,

95
00:08:33,333 --> 00:08:35,416
I AM BEYOND
YOUR COMPREHENSION.

96
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,916
AND EVEN IF YOU COULD,

97
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,625
YOU WOULD NOT HAVE THE TOOLS
TO EXPRESS THAT KNOWLEDGE.

98
00:08:40,708 --> 00:08:44,125
- CHIEF.
- THAT IS THE WAY IT HAS TO BE.

99
00:08:44,208 --> 00:08:46,166
YOU ALREADY KNOW THIS.

100
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:48,458
- ( grunting )

101
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:54,250
I'M STILL DREAMING.

102
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:57,166
Male voice: THIS IS NOT
A DREAM, VINCENT LAW.

103
00:08:57,250 --> 00:09:00,916
FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF OTHERS
I AM PART OF THE WORLD.

104
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,666
BUT WHEN I OBSERVE THE WORLD
FROM MY PERSPECTIVE,

105
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:05,541
I AM NOWHERE TO BE FOUND.

106
00:09:05,625 --> 00:09:08,083
TO OBSERVE
IS TO CREATE PERSPECTIVE.

107
00:09:08,166 --> 00:09:10,583
I CAN NEVER CEASE
TO BE THE POINT OF ORIGIN

108
00:09:10,666 --> 00:09:12,208
FROM MY PERSPECTIVE.

109
00:09:12,291 --> 00:09:15,125
I OBSERVE THAT
WHICH IS NOT MYSELF.

110
00:09:15,208 --> 00:09:17,708
THIS IS THE FIRST PRINCIPLE
DEFINED!

111
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:19,666
- ( grunting )

112
00:09:23,083 --> 00:09:24,833
- I AM NOBODY.

113
00:09:24,916 --> 00:09:27,166
EVEN IF I WAS SOMEBODY,

114
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:29,625
I AM BEYOND
YOUR COMPREHENSION.

115
00:09:29,708 --> 00:09:31,625
AND EVEN IF YOU COULD,

116
00:09:31,708 --> 00:09:35,208
YOU WOULD NOT HAVE THE TOOLS
TO EXPRESS THAT KNOWLEDGE.

117
00:09:35,291 --> 00:09:39,208
I DO NOT BELONG
TO THE WORLD.

118
00:09:39,291 --> 00:09:41,125
THAT IS THE LIMIT,

119
00:09:41,208 --> 00:09:44,708
THE BOUNDARY
BETWEEN ALL AND SELF.

120
00:09:44,791 --> 00:09:47,708
- WELL, I WAS THERE
BECAUSE I WAS TOLD

121
00:09:47,791 --> 00:09:50,458
THAT SOMEONE REPORTED
AN INFECTED AUTOREIV.

122
00:09:50,541 --> 00:09:52,041
- INCORRECT.

123
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:56,000
IT IS NOT
"I THINK THEREFORE I AM."

124
00:09:56,083 --> 00:09:58,000
- BUT I'M NOT LYING.

125
00:09:58,083 --> 00:10:00,791
IF YOU TAKE A LOOK
AT THE FACILITY'S RECORDS...

126
00:10:00,875 --> 00:10:02,625
- CORRECT.

127
00:10:02,708 --> 00:10:05,250
THE ANSWER IS,
"I THINK THEREFORE YOU ARE."

128
00:10:05,333 --> 00:10:08,250
YOU STILL DON'T REMEMBER,
DO YOU?

129
00:10:08,333 --> 00:10:10,833
- HOLD ON.
YOU KNOW, DON'T YOU?

130
00:10:10,916 --> 00:10:13,875
PLEASE TELL ME
WHAT THE PROXY IS.

131
00:10:13,958 --> 00:10:16,208
TELL ME ABOUT THE MONSTER.

132
00:10:16,291 --> 00:10:18,750
- YOU THINK PROXIES
ARE MONSTERS?

133
00:10:18,833 --> 00:10:20,416
( laughs )

134
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:22,250
YOU DON'T KNOW MUCH
ABOUT ANYTHING.

135
00:10:22,333 --> 00:10:24,708
PEOPLE HAVE CALLED THEM
MONSTERS OR DEMONS, BUT THAT'S--

136
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:26,916
- RE-L!
- --ALL NOTHING BUT NONSENSE.

137
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,708
IN TRUTH, PROXIES ARE-- 
- YOU!

138
00:10:28,791 --> 00:10:31,250
- THEY HAVE THE POWER
TO CHANGE THEIR APPEARANCE

139
00:10:31,333 --> 00:10:34,500
INTO ANY FORM THEY CHOOSE.
THEY CAN DISAPPEAR WITH EASE,

140
00:10:34,583 --> 00:10:36,541
LEAVING NO TRACE
THEY WERE EVER THERE.

141
00:10:36,625 --> 00:10:38,291
- IT'S ALL ABOUT YOU.

142
00:10:38,375 --> 00:10:40,333
- THEY CAN ALSO
ENTER HUMAN BEINGS

143
00:10:40,416 --> 00:10:42,916
AND TAKE CONTROL
OF THEIR MIND AND BODY.

144
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,625
- IT'S WHAT YOU ARE.

145
00:10:44,708 --> 00:10:46,208
- THEY CAN
SUMMON LIGHTENING BOLTS

146
00:10:46,291 --> 00:10:48,416
AND SCORCH THE EARTH
WITH THEIR POWER.

147
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:50,250
- IT'S TIME TO REMEMBER.

148
00:10:50,333 --> 00:10:52,583
- THEY CAN EVEN CONJURE UP
PLANETS FROM THE SKY!

149
00:10:52,666 --> 00:10:54,791
- ERGO PROXY!
- STOP IT!

150
00:10:54,875 --> 00:10:57,583
NO, I'M NOT!
I'M VINCENT LAW!

151
00:11:12,625 --> 00:11:16,916
REGISTRATION #0724FGARK.

152
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,916
MY NAME IS VINCENT LAW.

153
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,916
- IT SEEMS
YOU REALLY ARE A FOOL.

154
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,916
HAVE YOU LOST YOUR EYE
FOR THE TRUTH

155
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,291
AS WELL AS YOUR MEMORY?

156
00:11:34,375 --> 00:11:36,083
- MY MEMORY?

157
00:11:36,166 --> 00:11:38,333
I HAVE NO PROBLEM
WITH MY MEMORY.

158
00:11:38,416 --> 00:11:40,708
- WELL, THEN WHO ARE YOU?

159
00:11:40,791 --> 00:11:42,750
TRY AND TELL ME
WHO YOU REALLY ARE.

160
00:11:42,833 --> 00:11:44,750
( chuckles )

161
00:11:44,833 --> 00:11:46,875
- I'M--

162
00:11:51,708 --> 00:11:54,125
AFTER I IMMIGRATED
TO ROMDEAU,

163
00:11:54,208 --> 00:11:59,083
I GOT A STAFF JOB AT THE
AUTOREIV DISPOSAL UNIT FACILITY.

164
00:11:59,166 --> 00:12:00,500
- AND BEFORE THAT?

165
00:12:01,666 --> 00:12:03,583
- I WAS LOOKING FOR WORK

166
00:12:03,666 --> 00:12:06,458
IN THE F.G. TEMPORARY
IMMIGRANT DISTRICT.

167
00:12:06,541 --> 00:12:09,416
THAT'S WHERE I FIRST SAW RE-L.

168
00:12:11,916 --> 00:12:13,500
- AND BEFORE THAT?

169
00:12:14,791 --> 00:12:17,125
- BEFORE I IMMIGRATED
TO ROMDEAU,

170
00:12:17,208 --> 00:12:20,000
I LIVED
IN THE DOME CITY OF MOSK.

171
00:12:20,083 --> 00:12:21,791
THERE WAS AN ACCIDENT.

172
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:24,125
THE CITY WAS DESTROYED.

173
00:12:24,208 --> 00:12:25,833
IT WAS HORRIBLE.

174
00:12:25,916 --> 00:12:27,250
- AND BEFORE THAT?

175
00:12:28,458 --> 00:12:31,000
- I WAS IN MOSK.

176
00:12:32,916 --> 00:12:34,958
- AND WHAT HAPPENED THERE?

177
00:12:35,041 --> 00:12:37,791
- IT WAS A LONG TIME AGO.

178
00:12:37,875 --> 00:12:39,333
- WHAT HAPPENED?

179
00:12:39,416 --> 00:12:41,541
- I CAN'T REMEMBER.

180
00:12:44,416 --> 00:12:48,375
- YOU CAN'T REMEMBER BECAUSE YOU
STILL DON'T WANT TO REMEMBER.

181
00:12:48,458 --> 00:12:51,583
LET'S SEE WHAT QUESTIONS
YOU CAN ANSWER.

182
00:12:51,666 --> 00:12:53,041
- ( shattering )

183
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:57,958
- IF YOU CAN'T FIND
THE ANSWER YOURSELF,

184
00:12:58,041 --> 00:13:00,125
THEN ASKING ME
IS POINTLESS.

185
00:13:00,208 --> 00:13:03,000
YOU'RE NOT CAPABLE
OF UNDERSTANDING YET.

186
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:04,750
- WHY? 
- I'VE TOLD YOU.

187
00:13:04,833 --> 00:13:07,166
IT'S BECAUSE A PART OF YOU,
VINCENT--

188
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:10,250
OBSERVE.

189
00:13:10,333 --> 00:13:12,208
- Vincent:
NO.  I'M--

190
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:14,875
- ( fingers snap )

191
00:13:14,958 --> 00:13:17,166
- --DREAMING.

192
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:21,083
- THIS IS NOT A DREAM,
VINCENT LAW.

193
00:13:29,625 --> 00:13:32,000
- Bookkeeper: THE MOST
IMPORTANT PART OF A BOOKSTORE

194
00:13:32,083 --> 00:13:34,041
IS, OF COURSE, THE BOOKS.

195
00:13:34,125 --> 00:13:37,291
THERE IS A MAGIC INHERENT
IN LANGUAGE.

196
00:13:37,375 --> 00:13:39,958
OUR WORLD IS RULED
BY LOGOS.

197
00:13:40,041 --> 00:13:44,291
SOME WORDS CONTAIN THEIR
OWN INTERNAL CONTRADICTIONS.

198
00:13:44,375 --> 00:13:48,916
FROM THESE OPPOSITIONS,
GREAT TRUTHS CAN BE REVEALED.

199
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,208
BIOS, FOR EXAMPLE.

200
00:13:52,291 --> 00:13:56,875
THE WORD "BIOS" CAN BE DEFINED
AS THE PROCESS OF LIFE,

201
00:13:56,958 --> 00:14:00,708
OR AS THE ARCHER'S BOW.

202
00:14:00,791 --> 00:14:05,000
THE BOW AND LIFE-- AT FIRST,
THEY SEEM QUITE UNRELATED.

203
00:14:05,083 --> 00:14:08,583
BUT BOTH INEVITABLY RESULT
IN DEATH.

204
00:14:08,666 --> 00:14:13,000
THE PHILOSOPHERS OF THE ANCIENT
WORLD COULD BE VERY CLEVER.

205
00:14:13,083 --> 00:14:14,458
- YEAH.

206
00:14:16,083 --> 00:14:19,000
- "ANAMNESIS."

207
00:14:19,083 --> 00:14:21,000
THE WORD HAS TWO MEANINGS,

208
00:14:21,083 --> 00:14:25,000
BOTH MEMORY AND RECOLLECTION.

209
00:14:25,083 --> 00:14:27,083
- Male voice:
REMEMBRANCE.

210
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:29,416
WHO WAS VINCENT LAW?

211
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,541
WHAT WAS HE AFRAID OF?

212
00:14:31,625 --> 00:14:34,250
WHAT DID HE DECIDE
TO ERASE HERE?

213
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:37,208
- ( snaps )

214
00:14:40,333 --> 00:14:43,583
- I PRESENT A TIME
OF DESTRUCTION.

215
00:14:43,666 --> 00:14:45,833
THERE IS MISFORTUNE
IN THE STARS.

216
00:14:45,916 --> 00:14:49,125
THE SKY IS LOST
AND THE SEA IS FROZEN OVER.

217
00:14:49,208 --> 00:14:53,791
THE CIRCLE OF LIFE
WHICH ALLOW BOTH MAN

218
00:14:53,875 --> 00:14:58,041
AND NATURE TO FLOURISH
HAVE ALL BUT STOPPED.

219
00:14:58,125 --> 00:15:02,291
THE MAIN PLAYERS OF OUR STORY
HAVE LONG SINCE LEFT THE STAGE.

220
00:15:02,375 --> 00:15:07,041
WE HANG IN ANTICIPATION FOR
THE INEVITABLE FINAL CURTAIN.

221
00:15:07,125 --> 00:15:11,125
AND YET,
EVEN AT THIS LATE HOUR,

222
00:15:11,208 --> 00:15:15,291
TRACES OF THE GREAT CIRCLE
REMAIN.

223
00:15:15,375 --> 00:15:18,541
THE CIRCLE OF LIFE

224
00:15:18,625 --> 00:15:23,458
ONLY CONTINUES
BECAUSE YOU EXIST.

225
00:15:23,541 --> 00:15:27,375
WE WAIT TO SEE THE FATE
OF YOU LAST SURVIVORS

226
00:15:27,458 --> 00:15:30,791
OF THIS WORLD,
FOR IF YOU PERISH,

227
00:15:30,875 --> 00:15:33,208
PERCEPTION IS REMOVED

228
00:15:33,291 --> 00:15:37,041
AND EXISTENCE
COMES TO AN END.

229
00:15:37,125 --> 00:15:39,041
A UNIVERSE WITHOUT PERCEPTION

230
00:15:39,125 --> 00:15:41,666
IS MUCH LIKE AN ENORMOUS
STACK OF ROTTING BOOKS,

231
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:44,541
FOREVER UNOPENED
AND UNREAD.

232
00:15:44,625 --> 00:15:47,333
- STOP IT.
PLEASE STOP.

233
00:15:47,416 --> 00:15:50,833
- TO SURVIVE THIS DARKNESS,
THE UNIVERSE HAS THRUST ITSELF

234
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:53,500
INTO A NEXT PHASE
OF ITS LIFE CYCLE.

235
00:15:53,583 --> 00:15:55,083
LISTEN.

236
00:15:55,166 --> 00:15:58,833
CAN'T YOU HEAR THE PULSE
OF THE AWAKENING?

237
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:00,958
- THE PULSE...

238
00:16:01,041 --> 00:16:03,625
OF THE AWAKENING?

239
00:16:03,708 --> 00:16:05,958
- ( heartbeat )

240
00:16:06,041 --> 00:16:08,166
- Bookkeeper:
STOP BADGERING THE BOY.

241
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:10,250
HE CAN'T TAKE MUCH MORE.

242
00:16:12,291 --> 00:16:13,375
( snaps )

243
00:16:13,458 --> 00:16:16,625
LOOKS LIKE I GOT HERE
JUST IN TIME.

244
00:16:16,708 --> 00:16:18,625
A PULSE--

245
00:16:18,708 --> 00:16:20,666
THE MEASURE OF A LIFE.

246
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:25,083
EVERY ANIMAL ON THIS PLANET
HAS A CIRCULATORY SYSTEM

247
00:16:25,166 --> 00:16:28,750
IN SCALE WITH THE MASS
OF ITS OWN BODY.

248
00:16:28,833 --> 00:16:31,875
IN FACT,
THE BEATING OF THEIR HEART

249
00:16:31,958 --> 00:16:35,041
CAN BE USED
TO PREDICT LIFE SPAN.

250
00:16:35,125 --> 00:16:37,791
IT'S CALLED KLEIBER'S LAW.

251
00:16:37,875 --> 00:16:41,375
AND TO TRY TO GO FORWARD WITHOUT
GRASPING THIS ESSENTIAL LAW,

252
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:43,000
IT WOULD BE POINTLESS.

253
00:16:43,083 --> 00:16:45,458
- THAT'S ENOUGH, OLD MAN.

254
00:16:45,541 --> 00:16:49,250
- OLD MAN? I AM THE GATEKEEPER
OF MEMORY, YOU FOOL.

255
00:16:49,333 --> 00:16:52,541
AND YOU'VE NO RIGHT
TO BE THREATENING THE CORE SELF.

256
00:16:52,625 --> 00:16:55,333
- WHAT'S THE POINT
OF HAVING A GATEKEEPER

257
00:16:55,416 --> 00:16:58,708
IF YOU NEVER OPEN THE GATE?
NOW IT'S TIME TO REMEMBER.

258
00:16:58,791 --> 00:17:01,333
- ENOUGH!
- REMEMBER.

259
00:17:01,416 --> 00:17:05,250
REMEMBER HOW WE SOMEHOW MANAGED
TO ALTER OUR OWN PULSE.

260
00:17:05,333 --> 00:17:08,000
REMEMBER,
FEEL THE POUNDING IN YOUR CHEST

261
00:17:08,083 --> 00:17:11,541
AS THE PULSE QUICKENS.
IT BELONGS TO NO ONE ELSE.

262
00:17:11,625 --> 00:17:13,625
IT IS YOURS AND MINE.

263
00:17:13,708 --> 00:17:16,708
IT IS THE FOUNDATION
OF OUR TRUTH--

264
00:17:16,791 --> 00:17:19,375
PROOF THAT WE BELONG
IN THIS WORLD,

265
00:17:19,458 --> 00:17:23,541
THAT WE ARE OF THIS WORLD.

266
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:25,916
FOLLOW YOUR INSTINCTS.

267
00:17:27,708 --> 00:17:30,958
YOU'LL FIND THE ANSWERS
YOU SEEK INSIDE.

268
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:42,500
THE WHITE NOISE THAT BEATS
WITHIN THE WHITE DARKNESS

269
00:17:42,583 --> 00:17:45,833
IS THE RHYTHM OF LIFE.

270
00:17:45,916 --> 00:17:50,250
IT IS THAT PULSE WHICH
NEVER TRULY LEFT THE STAGE.

271
00:17:50,333 --> 00:17:54,083
- IN MY DESPERATE ATTEMPTS
TO BECOME A FELLOW CITIZEN,

272
00:17:54,166 --> 00:17:57,083
I HAVE
CONSTANTLY SUPPRESSED MYSELF.

273
00:17:57,166 --> 00:18:00,583
I TRIED TO BE THE PERSON
I THOUGHT THEY WANTED,

274
00:18:00,666 --> 00:18:03,541
CONSTANTLY, EVERYWHERE.

275
00:18:03,625 --> 00:18:05,208
- IF IT'S INTERRUPTED,

276
00:18:05,291 --> 00:18:08,708
THAT WHICH NEEDS TO BE EXPRESSED
WILL BE EXPRESSED.

277
00:18:08,791 --> 00:18:12,291
OUR WORDS WILL CONNECT US
AGAIN TO SOMEONE ELSE.

278
00:18:12,375 --> 00:18:15,708
- Vincent:
LOOK WHAT'S HAPPENED TO ME.

279
00:18:15,791 --> 00:18:18,333
I'M A FAILURE.

280
00:18:18,416 --> 00:18:20,500
- TO SECURE US
IN THIS CIRCLE,

281
00:18:20,583 --> 00:18:24,166
TO BRING US INTO THIS
TETHERED SYSTEM WE CALL LIFE,

282
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:26,833
SOMEONE WHO IS NOT OF US
HAD TO CREATE,

283
00:18:26,916 --> 00:18:28,875
TO BRING US INTO BEING.

284
00:18:28,958 --> 00:18:31,375
- Vincent:
DOUBTING THE SYSTEM IS BAD.

285
00:18:31,458 --> 00:18:33,583
ALWAYS OBEY.

286
00:18:33,666 --> 00:18:37,333
THOSE ARE THE CONDITIONS
FOR BEING A FELLOW CITIZEN.

287
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:39,166
- CAN'T YOU HEAR IT?

288
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:42,291
THE PULSE OF THE AWAKENING
BEATING IN YOUR CHEST.

289
00:18:42,375 --> 00:18:46,166
WE HEAR IT TOGETHER, JOINED BY
THE HEART BEATING IN OUR CHEST.

290
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:49,583
LISTEN.
ITS PULSE IS FOR BOTH OF US.

291
00:18:49,666 --> 00:18:53,583
- BUT I'LL NEVER
BECOME A FELLOW CITIZEN.

292
00:18:53,666 --> 00:18:55,958
- ( snapping )

293
00:18:59,958 --> 00:19:01,583
- Both voices: VINCENT!

294
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:05,291
- Vincent: IT'S OVER.

295
00:19:05,375 --> 00:19:08,791
MY LIFE-- IT'S ALL OVER.

296
00:19:14,958 --> 00:19:17,500
- NOW YOU KNOW THAT I AM YOU.

297
00:19:19,208 --> 00:19:22,666
AND YOU ARE ME.

298
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:24,750
- NO!  I--

299
00:19:24,833 --> 00:19:26,916
I'M VINCENT LAW!

300
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:31,333
- VINCENT LAW,
TAKE A REAL LOOK AT YOURSELF.

301
00:19:33,208 --> 00:19:35,916
THEN I'LL ASK YOU AGAIN--

302
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,958
WHAT ARE YOU THE AGENT OF?

303
00:19:46,083 --> 00:19:48,125
- Vincent:
I'M--

304
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:57,000
AHHH!

305
00:19:57,083 --> 00:19:58,500
- ( glass shattering )

306
00:19:58,583 --> 00:20:01,625
- ( Vincent shouting )

307
00:20:03,041 --> 00:20:05,958
I'M--

308
00:20:06,041 --> 00:20:08,041
RE-L.

309
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:10,166
NO.

310
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:13,458
I DON'T REMEMBER HOW,

311
00:20:13,541 --> 00:20:15,333
WHY,

312
00:20:15,416 --> 00:20:17,083
ANYTHING.

313
00:20:17,166 --> 00:20:19,750
BUT I KNOW.

314
00:20:19,833 --> 00:20:21,750
NOW I KNOW.

315
00:20:21,833 --> 00:20:25,250
I AM ERGO PROXY.

316
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:32,333
( sobbing )

317
00:20:32,416 --> 00:20:34,791
- KEEP IN MIND, VINCENT,

318
00:20:34,875 --> 00:20:39,625
YOU HAVE JUST CROSSED
THE THRESHOLD OF TRUTH.

319
00:20:39,708 --> 00:20:42,458
IT'S TIME TO FIND YOUR WAY

320
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:44,458
TO KNOWLEDGE.

321
00:20:44,541 --> 00:20:46,833
- ( sobbing )

322
00:20:46,916 --> 00:20:48,750
- ( fingers snap )

323
00:20:54,416 --> 00:20:57,791
- Bookkeeper: YEAH, I THINK
IT'S BEEN ABOUT THREE MINUTES.

324
00:20:57,875 --> 00:20:59,916
THE TEA IS READY.

325
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,375
GO ON, DRINK UP.

326
00:21:07,041 --> 00:21:09,375
SO WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU?

327
00:21:09,458 --> 00:21:13,250
- UH, WELL,
ACTUALLY I THINK I'M LOST.

328
00:21:13,333 --> 00:21:16,041
- YEAH, WELL, I SORT OF FIGURED
YOU'D SAY THAT.

329
00:21:16,125 --> 00:21:17,750
WE GET THAT A LOT
AROUND HERE.

330
00:21:17,833 --> 00:21:19,666
- WITH THE FOG--

331
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:23,666
- A MAN SAID THE FUTURE
IS AN OPAQUE MIRROR.

332
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:26,666
ANYONE WHO TRIES
TO LOOK INTO IT SEES NOTHING

333
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:29,250
BUT THE DIM OUTLINES
OF AN OLD AND WORRIED FACE.

334
00:21:29,333 --> 00:21:33,750
- MY SHIP-- I KNOW MY SHIP
IS DOCKED SOMEWHERE AROUND HERE.

335
00:21:33,833 --> 00:21:36,375
- THE ANSWERS YOU SEEK
YOU WILL NEVER FIND

336
00:21:36,458 --> 00:21:38,375
UNTIL YOU STOP LOOKING OUTSIDE

337
00:21:38,458 --> 00:21:41,291
AND START LOOKING FOR THEM
WITHIN YOURSELF.

338
00:21:41,375 --> 00:21:44,583
- HAVE YOU SEEN A LITTLE-GIRL
TYPE AUTOREIV AROUND HERE?

339
00:21:44,666 --> 00:21:46,291
HER NAME IS PINO.

340
00:21:46,375 --> 00:21:47,458
- YOU MIGHT HAVE BETTER LUCK

341
00:21:47,541 --> 00:21:49,958
LOOKING FOR ONE LOST
THING AT A TIME.

342
00:21:50,041 --> 00:21:51,750
( chuckles )
- THE SHIP.

343
00:21:51,833 --> 00:21:54,833
NO, I MEAN PINO.
HAVE YOU SEEN HER?

344
00:21:54,916 --> 00:21:56,875
- SORRY.

345
00:21:56,958 --> 00:21:59,750
I HOPE YOU CAN BE COMFORTABLE
IN YOUR ACCEPTANCE.

346
00:21:59,833 --> 00:22:03,000
WANDERING LOST IN THE DARK
FOR SUCH A LONG TIME--

347
00:22:03,083 --> 00:22:04,875
IT CAN BE REAL EASY
TO LOSE SIGHT

348
00:22:04,958 --> 00:22:06,750
OF THE THINGS
THAT ARE IMPORTANT.

349
00:22:06,833 --> 00:22:08,875
- MY ACCEPTANCE IS JUST FINE.

350
00:22:08,958 --> 00:22:11,125
- THAT'S AN ACCOMPLISHMENT.
CAN YOU TELL ME

351
00:22:11,208 --> 00:22:13,458
JUST WHAT IT IS
YOU'VE ACCEPTED?

352
00:22:13,541 --> 00:22:15,750
- HUH?
- GO ON THEN.

353
00:22:15,833 --> 00:22:19,000
- I'M JUST LOST, THAT'S ALL.
I GOT LOST.

354
00:22:19,083 --> 00:22:22,875
- ( clapping )
WELL, ALL RIGHT.

355
00:22:22,958 --> 00:22:25,250
THAT BEING THE CASE,
I'D BE HAPPY

356
00:22:25,333 --> 00:22:27,250
TO POINT YOU IN THE
RIGHT DIRECTION.

357
00:22:27,333 --> 00:22:28,916
GOOD LUCK, VINCENT LAW.

358
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,750
I MEAN, ERGO PROXY.

359
00:22:32,833 --> 00:22:34,333
- WAIT!
- ( snaps )

360
00:22:51,708 --> 00:22:53,125
- HMM?

361
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:56,666
( laughs )

362
00:23:09,583 --> 00:23:11,583
VINCE?

363
00:23:14,708 --> 00:23:16,916
VINCE?

364
00:23:45,958 --> 00:23:49,041
- Vincent: I KNOW NOW.

365
00:23:49,125 --> 00:23:52,041
I AM A PROXY.

366
00:24:04,875 --> 00:24:07,083
- I FINALLY FOUND YOU.

367
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:12,875
- I'M DREAMING.

368
00:24:12,958 --> 00:24:17,000
- THIS IS NOT A DREAM,
VINCENT LAW.

369
00:24:31,541 --> 00:24:34,750
