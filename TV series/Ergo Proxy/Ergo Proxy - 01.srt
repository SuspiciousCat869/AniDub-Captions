1
00:00:39,958 --> 00:00:41,833
- ( beeping )

2
00:00:43,666 --> 00:00:45,083
- MP SIGNAL.

3
00:00:45,166 --> 00:00:47,875
SPECIMEN'S VITAL SIGNS
CONFIRMED.

4
00:00:47,958 --> 00:00:49,875
- SUBJECT ENTERING
AWAKENING STATE.

5
00:00:49,958 --> 00:00:52,916
- AND THE SEDATIVES?
- THEY AREN'T HAVING ANY EFFECT.

6
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,416
- IT'S WAKING UP.
WE CAN'T LET THAT HAPPEN.

7
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:59,208
KEEP IT ASLEEP
AT ALL COSTS!

8
00:01:12,958 --> 00:01:15,541
- A BREACH HAS OCCURRED.
STARTING DATA BACKUP.

9
00:01:15,625 --> 00:01:18,333
ALL PERSONNEL ARE
ADVISED TO EVACUATE.

10
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:20,875
- NO, WAIT!

11
00:01:23,833 --> 00:01:25,791
- ( alarm buzzing )

12
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:32,375
- ( turns off alarm )

13
00:01:55,625 --> 00:01:59,250
- Man: THAT IS WHEN EVERYTHING
BECAME PERFECTLY CLEAR.

14
00:02:01,583 --> 00:02:06,041
EVERYTHING ABOUT THE MALICE,
IMPLANTED BY THE CREATOR.

15
00:02:09,208 --> 00:02:12,500
WE CANNOT RESIST
THAT WHICH IS.

16
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:16,708
WE SIMPLY--

17
00:02:16,791 --> 00:02:19,416
WE SIMPLY HAVE TO PUNISH THEM.

18
00:02:26,791 --> 00:02:29,708
CAN YOU HEAR THE PULSE

19
00:02:29,791 --> 00:02:31,416
OF THE AWAKENING?

20
00:02:55,625 --> 00:02:59,416
- (Loudspeaker) FELLOW CITIZENS,
THE TIME IS NOW TO CONSUME.

21
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:02,958
WHY SKIMP
WHEN YOU DESERVE MORE?

22
00:03:05,708 --> 00:03:10,166
FELLOW CITIZENS,
DO YOUR PART AND MAKE WASTE.

23
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:14,166
LIFE IS EASY
WHEN YOU LIGHTEN THE LOAD.

24
00:03:15,875 --> 00:03:20,083
FELLOW CITIZENS,
THE TIME IS NOW TO CONSUME.

25
00:03:20,166 --> 00:03:23,708
WHY SKIMP WHEN YOU DESERVE MORE?

26
00:03:25,083 --> 00:03:27,458
- MY APOLOGIES.

27
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:30,458
WELL, WE'VE MADE ALL
THE NECESSARY PREPARATIONS.

28
00:03:32,333 --> 00:03:34,291
YES, THAT'S CORRECT.

29
00:03:34,375 --> 00:03:38,250
FINE.
WE'LL TALK ABOUT IT LATER.

30
00:03:38,333 --> 00:03:41,250
WHAT ON EARTH IS GOING ON?
WHAT COULD BE IMPORTANT ENOUGH

31
00:03:41,333 --> 00:03:42,791
TO MAKE ME CHANGE MY SCHEDULE?

32
00:03:42,875 --> 00:03:45,708
- THIS IS A LEVEL ULTIMATE
INTELLIGENCE DISCLOSURE.

33
00:03:45,791 --> 00:03:46,750
YOU NEED TO HURRY.

34
00:04:04,625 --> 00:04:08,166
- ( gunshots )
- ( screaming )

35
00:04:12,708 --> 00:04:15,041
- ( grunting )

36
00:04:32,541 --> 00:04:35,083
- ( screaming )

37
00:04:40,291 --> 00:04:43,333
- CAN YOU CONFIRM THE INCIDENT?
- YES.

38
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:47,041
I'M ABSOLUTELY SURE OF IT.
I SAW IT HAPPEN.

39
00:04:47,125 --> 00:04:48,333
- Woman: A BREACH HAS
OCCURRED...

40
00:04:48,416 --> 00:04:50,166
- YOUR JOB IS DONE.

41
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:53,000
WE WILL LEAVE THE REST
TO RAUL.

42
00:04:53,083 --> 00:04:56,291
- Man: WAIT.
WHAT ABOUT THE--

43
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:03,083
- BY THE WAY, IS LITTLE RE-L
PLANNING TO SHOW UP TONIGHT?

44
00:05:40,208 --> 00:05:42,125
- RE-L, BY ANY CHANCE,

45
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:44,458
DID YOU GO TO
REGENT DONOV'S LAST NIGHT?

46
00:05:44,541 --> 00:05:46,541
- NO, I DIDN'T.

47
00:05:46,625 --> 00:05:48,583
HE WOULD HAVE JUST GIVEN ME
ANOTHER ONE OF HIS LECTURES.

48
00:05:48,666 --> 00:05:49,833
THAT'S ALL GRANDFATHER DOES.

49
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:53,750
- YOU ARE HIS LITTLE PRINCESS.
- IGGY.

50
00:05:53,833 --> 00:05:56,958
- BY THE WAY, THE SECURITY
BUREAU CONDUCTED SPOT SEARCHES

51
00:05:57,041 --> 00:06:00,708
ACROSS THE CITY LAST NIGHT. WHAT
DO YOU THINK THAT WAS ABOUT?

52
00:06:00,791 --> 00:06:03,333
THEY EVEN WANT US TO PROVIDE
THEM WITH INFORMATION

53
00:06:03,416 --> 00:06:05,583
FROM OUR DEPARTMENT
ABOUT INFECTED AUTOREIVS.

54
00:06:05,666 --> 00:06:08,041
WE'RE THE INTELLIGENCE BUREAU
AND THEY TELL US NOTHING.

55
00:06:08,125 --> 00:06:11,000
WHO'S THE NEW MAN OVER THERE?
RAUL, ISN'T IT?

56
00:06:11,083 --> 00:06:12,166
I DON'T CARE FOR HIM
VERY MUCH.

57
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:14,458
- I KNOW HIM.

58
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:17,208
- THEN THERE'S THE SUPPLEMENTAL
REPORT ABOUT THE RESIDENTS

59
00:06:17,291 --> 00:06:19,208
WHO WERE BRUTALLY MURDERED.

60
00:06:19,291 --> 00:06:21,541
I JUST CAN'T SEE HOW THIS
COULD POSSIBLY BE THE WORK

61
00:06:21,625 --> 00:06:24,458
OF AN AUTOREIV INFECTED
WITH THE COGITO VIRUS.

62
00:06:24,541 --> 00:06:27,708
WHAT DO YOU THINK?  RE-L?!
- ENOUGH.

63
00:06:27,791 --> 00:06:30,625
CUT THE TURING APPLICATION
FROM THE LANGUAGE FIELD.

64
00:06:30,708 --> 00:06:33,791
- ROGER.
TURING APPLICATION CUT.

65
00:06:33,875 --> 00:06:36,666
PLEASE CONFIRM.
- GOOD.

66
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:39,291
NOW GO TO THE FG TEMPORARY
IMMIGRANT DISTRICT'S AUTOREIV

67
00:06:39,375 --> 00:06:43,750
DISPOSAL FACILITY.
- CONFIRMED.

68
00:06:46,083 --> 00:06:47,666
- ( sighs )

69
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:58,583
ROMDEAU CITY.

70
00:06:58,666 --> 00:07:00,666
THIS PLACE IS UNDOUBTEDLY

71
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:02,958
OUR FINAL PARADISE.

72
00:07:05,916 --> 00:07:09,375
TODAY IS JUST
ANOTHER DAY HERE.

73
00:07:09,458 --> 00:07:12,166
NOTHING CHANGES FOR THE BETTER
IN THIS CRADLE,

74
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:15,125
WHICH WAS BUILT AMIDST
THE ENVIRONMENTAL DESTRUCTION

75
00:07:15,208 --> 00:07:18,625
THAT NOW SURROUNDS OUR PLANET,

76
00:07:18,708 --> 00:07:21,916
A BORING PARADISE.

77
00:07:45,916 --> 00:07:49,208
WELL, THEN, HAVE YOU VERIFIED
THAT THE BK-30 TYPE

78
00:07:49,291 --> 00:07:52,291
THAT ESCAPED WAS INFECTED?

79
00:07:52,375 --> 00:07:54,791
- I'M SORRY, DOROTHY.

80
00:07:54,875 --> 00:07:57,125
I'LL SUBMIT AN INTENT
TO ESCAPE REPORT.

81
00:07:57,208 --> 00:07:58,583
HOWEVER...

82
00:07:58,666 --> 00:08:01,666
- ( groaning )

83
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:06,083
- HOWEVER, YOU MUST MEET
WITH THE PERSON

84
00:08:06,166 --> 00:08:07,666
FROM THE INTELLIGENCE BUREAU
WHEN SHE COMES IN TODAY

85
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:09,666
REGARDING THE CASE.

86
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:12,166
- YES.
- ALL RIGHT.

87
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:14,666
NEXT YOU HAVE A NEW INFECTION
TO INVESTIGATE.

88
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:16,416
YOU'VE RECEIVED A PERMIT

89
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:19,375
TO ENTER THE CITIZEN'S
RESIDENTIAL DISTRICT.

90
00:08:21,708 --> 00:08:25,041
DON'T WORRY.
IF YOU DO AS I INSTRUCT YOU TO,

91
00:08:25,125 --> 00:08:27,916
YOU CAN BECOME
A FELLOW CITIZEN.

92
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,416
- STOP RELYING SO HEAVILY
ON YOUR ENTOURAGE.

93
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:34,750
ENTOURAGES WILL ALWAYS
BE AUTOREIVS AND NOTHING MORE.

94
00:08:34,833 --> 00:08:37,083
TO BECOME A FELLOW CITIZEN
YOU NEED TO WORK HARDER

95
00:08:37,166 --> 00:08:39,083
ON YOUR HUMAN RELATIONSHIPS.

96
00:08:39,166 --> 00:08:40,916
INSPECTOR RE-L.

97
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,625
- WE MET AT THE INTERVIEW,
RIGHT?

98
00:08:44,708 --> 00:08:47,000
- VINCENT LAW.

99
00:08:47,083 --> 00:08:48,458
- VINCENT.

100
00:08:48,541 --> 00:08:50,708
- HIS EXCELLENCY'S
GRANDDAUGHTER.

101
00:08:50,791 --> 00:08:52,791
- IF ONLY YOU'D LET ME KNOW
BEFOREHAND, I WOULD HAVE--

102
00:08:52,875 --> 00:08:56,416
- YOU WERE TOLD NOT TO ADDRESS
HER IN THAT MANNER PREVIOUSLY.

103
00:09:02,916 --> 00:09:06,750
- THIS IS THE INFECTED AUTOREIV
FROM LAST NIGHT.

104
00:09:06,833 --> 00:09:09,791
- IT'S MESSED UP.

105
00:09:09,875 --> 00:09:11,458
- IT'S BECAUSE
OF THE OUTDATED EQUIPMENT

106
00:09:11,541 --> 00:09:13,916
THAT'S ISSUED TO US
DISPOSAL UNIT CREWS.

107
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,333
THEY CAN'T STOP THEM
FROM FUNCTIONING

108
00:09:15,416 --> 00:09:17,333
UNLESS WE DISMANTLE THEM.

109
00:09:17,416 --> 00:09:19,166
- IS THAT A COMPLAINT?

110
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:21,000
- NO, I'M SORRY.

111
00:09:21,083 --> 00:09:24,291
HERE'S THE HIPPOCAMPUS FILE.

112
00:09:25,416 --> 00:09:27,291
- ONE THING WE KNOW FOR SURE

113
00:09:27,375 --> 00:09:30,041
THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF INFECTIONS
IN HIS TYPES RECENTLY.

114
00:09:31,875 --> 00:09:33,666
ANALYZING.

115
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:35,458
- THEY SAY AUTOREIVS
THAT HAVE BEEN INFECTED

116
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:38,166
WITH THE COGITO VIRUS
ACHIEVE SELF-AWARENESS

117
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:42,416
AND CAN NO LONGER
BE CONTROLLED BY HUMANS.

118
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:45,750
IN THIS CITY OF ROMDEAU,
WHERE ALL THE SYSTEMS

119
00:09:45,833 --> 00:09:48,166
ARE DESIGNED IN ORDER
THAT WE MAY LIVE,

120
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:51,500
EVEN THE PRAYERS OF AN AUTOREIV
WHO'S PREPARED TO DIE

121
00:09:51,583 --> 00:09:53,708
ARE UNNECESSARY.

122
00:09:53,791 --> 00:09:57,208
YOU HAVE THE VERY IMPORTANT TASK
OF PROTECTING THE PEOPLE.

123
00:09:57,291 --> 00:09:59,833
THAT'S THE SHORTEST ROUTE
FOR AN IMMIGRANT

124
00:09:59,916 --> 00:10:02,666
TO BECOME A FELLOW CITIZEN.

125
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:06,000
BY THE WAY, VINCENT.
- YES.

126
00:10:06,083 --> 00:10:09,291
- I SEE YOU'RE STILL
WEARING THAT THING.

127
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:10,708
- UH, YES.

128
00:10:10,791 --> 00:10:13,500
- THINGS THAT SMELL OF MOSK ARE
ARE TO BE THROWN AWAY.

129
00:10:15,916 --> 00:10:17,208
DON'T BRING IT
TO YOUR HEARING.

130
00:10:17,291 --> 00:10:19,000
- Iggy: ANALYSIS COMPLETE.

131
00:10:19,083 --> 00:10:20,541
- TELL ME.

132
00:10:22,083 --> 00:10:24,041
- WE'RE IN LUCK, RE-L.

133
00:10:24,125 --> 00:10:26,208
LOOKS LIKE PART
OF THE AUTONOMIC NEURO FILE

134
00:10:26,291 --> 00:10:27,958
MANAGED TO ESCAPE INFECTION.

135
00:10:28,041 --> 00:10:30,833
I DID A RECONSTRUCTION BASED
ON ITS MEMORY INFORMATION

136
00:10:30,916 --> 00:10:32,875
AND OBTAINED A PROJECTED
ESCAPE ROUTE.

137
00:10:32,958 --> 00:10:33,958
- GOOD.
- SORRY.

138
00:10:34,041 --> 00:10:35,708
- YOU CAN RETURN TO YOUR DUTIES.

139
00:10:35,791 --> 00:10:38,791
I THINK YOUR ENTOURAGE
IS GROWING IMPATIENT.

140
00:10:45,125 --> 00:10:48,375
- WELL, DID YOU SEE THE WAY
HE WAS STARING AT YOU?

141
00:10:48,458 --> 00:10:51,583
- OH, WAS HE?
- AS IF YOU DIDN'T NOTICE.

142
00:10:51,666 --> 00:10:53,708
- Man: VINCENT.

143
00:10:53,791 --> 00:10:55,708
SORRY, I KNOW YOU'VE
BEEN UP ALL NIGHT,

144
00:10:55,791 --> 00:10:58,291
BUT I NEED YOU TO MAKE UP
FOR YOUR MISTAKE RIGHT AWAY.

145
00:10:58,375 --> 00:11:00,708
- YOU MUST EXAMINE AN AUTOREIV
FOR INFECTION.

146
00:11:00,791 --> 00:11:02,291
- LOOK OVER THERE.

147
00:11:02,375 --> 00:11:05,333
THAT IS A FACE
OF AN IDEAL FELLOW CITIZEN.

148
00:11:05,416 --> 00:11:08,875
THE FACE OF A PERSON
THIS CITY DESIRES.

149
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:12,416
A DULL FACE.

150
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,500
BUT PERHAPS IT'S ME,

151
00:11:14,583 --> 00:11:17,416
THE ONE WHO LOOKS DOWN
ON THEM,

152
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:20,166
WHO HAS NOW
BECOME UNNECESSARY.

153
00:11:21,958 --> 00:11:23,375
LET'S GO, IGGY.

154
00:11:33,083 --> 00:11:36,041
- RIGHT NOW
I JUST CAN'T SAY WHEN.

155
00:11:36,125 --> 00:11:39,958
THEN I'LL LEAVE IT UP TO YOU.
I'M SORRY ABOUT THIS.

156
00:11:40,041 --> 00:11:42,458
- ( beeps )
- PLEASE, CONTINUE.

157
00:11:42,541 --> 00:11:44,916
- YES.
WE'VE EXPANDED THE SEARCH

158
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,250
TO INCLUDE THE AREAS IN
AND AROUND THE D, E AND F

159
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:51,250
TEMPORARY IMMIGRANT DISTRICTS.

160
00:11:51,333 --> 00:11:53,416
ARMED AUTOREIVS ARE CURRENTLY
PATROLLING THE MAINLAND

161
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,041
AS WELL AS THE ISLAND.

162
00:11:55,125 --> 00:11:58,250
BUT THEY STILL HAVEN'T
BEEN ABLE TO FIND ANYTHING.

163
00:11:58,333 --> 00:12:00,250
- THEN PERHAPS WE SHOULD
NO LONGER ASSUME

164
00:12:00,333 --> 00:12:02,083
IT'S IN THE RESIDENTIAL AREAS.

165
00:12:02,166 --> 00:12:04,500
- I'LL MAKE THE ARRANGEMENTS.

166
00:12:04,583 --> 00:12:09,166
IT'S AN ABANDONED IMMIGRATION
BUREAU FACILITY.

167
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:10,541
THEY SAY THERE'S A NUMBER
OF IMMIGRANTS

168
00:12:10,625 --> 00:12:12,958
WHO NOW OCCUPY IT ILLEGALLY.
- ( cell phone rings )

169
00:12:13,041 --> 00:12:16,250
- HEADQUARTERS.  WE'VE REACHED
THE PROJECTED ESCAPE ROUTE.

170
00:12:16,333 --> 00:12:19,666
YES, THE CHIEF CAN TAKE IT
FROM THERE.

171
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:22,666
WE'LL GIVE A DETAILED
REPORT LATER.

172
00:12:24,791 --> 00:12:26,250
- RE-L,
THEY WANT US TO WAIT

173
00:12:26,333 --> 00:12:28,125
UNTIL THE SECURITY
BUREAU ARRIVES.

174
00:12:28,208 --> 00:12:30,541
IT'S THE CHIEF'S ORDERS.
- SHH.

175
00:12:37,375 --> 00:12:38,250
( grunts )

176
00:12:45,458 --> 00:12:48,291
- THAT'S MARY.
SHE BELONGS TO ME.

177
00:12:51,875 --> 00:12:53,000
- Man: CONFIRMED.

178
00:12:53,083 --> 00:12:57,333
IT'S AN ED-26731
COMPANION AUTOREIV.

179
00:12:57,416 --> 00:12:59,208
- SHIT.

180
00:12:59,291 --> 00:13:01,708
- MAY I SEE YOUR
IMMIGRATION PERMIT?

181
00:13:36,458 --> 00:13:38,375
- WHAT WAS THAT?

182
00:13:56,083 --> 00:13:58,291
IS SHE INFECTED
WITH THE VIRUS?

183
00:14:12,625 --> 00:14:15,000
- RE-L, WHAT HAPPENED?

184
00:14:15,083 --> 00:14:17,708
- TARGET, SINGLE KILL,
CONFIRMED.

185
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,791
WAIT!

186
00:14:21,875 --> 00:14:24,875
IGGY, IT'S THE AUTOREIV
FROM BEFORE!

187
00:14:30,958 --> 00:14:33,583
- WHAT JUST HAPPENED?

188
00:14:33,666 --> 00:14:35,958
- IGGY,
CONTACT THE DISPOSAL UNIT.

189
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:37,875
HAVE THEM GO AFTER HER.
- ROGER!

190
00:14:37,958 --> 00:14:40,625
- THE QUESTION IS...

191
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,875
WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?

192
00:15:21,333 --> 00:15:24,458
- ( beeps )
- THAT COMPLETES THE ANALYSIS.

193
00:15:24,541 --> 00:15:26,583
BUT THERE DOESN'T APPEAR
TO BE ANY SIGN OF INFECTION.

194
00:15:26,666 --> 00:15:29,041
- THAT CAN'T BE.

195
00:15:29,125 --> 00:15:31,083
IF YOU HAD SEEN THE WAY PINO
WAS ACTING YESTERDAY.

196
00:15:31,166 --> 00:15:35,000
- IT'S JUST THAT THE TEST
RESULTS ARE HIGHLY RELIABLE.

197
00:15:35,083 --> 00:15:36,958
OH.

198
00:15:37,041 --> 00:15:38,583
- OH, THAT.

199
00:15:38,666 --> 00:15:42,000
IT'S OUR GOOD FORTUNE THAT
THE WELFARE AND HUMAN AFFAIRS

200
00:15:42,083 --> 00:15:43,750
DEPARTMENT HAS JUST DECIDED

201
00:15:43,833 --> 00:15:45,333
TO GIVE US THE CHILD
WE'VE ALWAYS WANTED,

202
00:15:45,416 --> 00:15:48,166
WHICH MEANS AN AUTOREIV
THAT CAN ALSO SERVE

203
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:50,458
AS A HOUSEKEEPER
WOULD BE BENEFICIAL

204
00:15:50,541 --> 00:15:52,458
FOR THE CHILD'S EDUCATION
AND DEVELOPMENT.

205
00:15:52,541 --> 00:15:53,833
- IT'S TRUE.

206
00:15:53,916 --> 00:15:55,666
RESIDENTS ARE ENCOURAGED
TO CONSUME AND DISPOSE

207
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:59,166
OF PRODUCTS MORE, BUT AS
LONG AS IT'S NOT INFECTED,

208
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:02,041
IT'D BE AGAINST REGULATIONS
FOR ME TO TAKE IT BACK.

209
00:16:02,125 --> 00:16:05,666
- DON'T GIVE ME THAT.
I KNOW YOU'RE AN IMMIGRANT.

210
00:16:07,625 --> 00:16:10,791
HOW CAN AN IMMIGRANT NOT LISTEN
TO THE REQUEST OF A CITIZEN?

211
00:16:13,416 --> 00:16:14,875
LOWLY IMMIGRANT.

212
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:18,833
MY HUSBAND IS THE CHIEF
OF THE CITIZENS SECURITY BUREAU.

213
00:16:18,916 --> 00:16:21,041
( gulps )

214
00:16:21,125 --> 00:16:24,041
- I WAS TAUGHT THAT YOU MUSTN'T
SPEAK ILL OF IMMIGRANTS.

215
00:16:24,125 --> 00:16:27,083
ISN'T THAT RIGHT, MOTHER?

216
00:16:27,166 --> 00:16:30,708
MOTHER, YOU STILL HAVEN'T
DONE THE HOUSEWORK TODAY.

217
00:16:30,791 --> 00:16:34,083
IF FATHER WERE TO COME HOME,
HE'D BE VERY UNHAPPY.

218
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:40,541
- RAUL, IT'S UNFORTUNATE THAT
THIS SITUATION AROSE

219
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:43,333
RIGHT AFTER YOU TOOK OFFICE
AS CHIEF.

220
00:16:43,416 --> 00:16:47,333
- PERHAPS.  OR IT COULD BE
THAT HE IS LUCKY

221
00:16:47,416 --> 00:16:49,500
BECAUSE THE PROXY HAS AWAKENED.

222
00:16:49,583 --> 00:16:52,458
- AN ON-GOING SWEEP
OPERATION FOCUSING

223
00:16:52,541 --> 00:16:54,625
ON THE RESIDENTIAL AREAS
HAS BEEN TAKING PLACE

224
00:16:54,708 --> 00:16:57,916
ACROSS THE ENTIRE ROMDEAU
DOMED CITY SINCE LAST NIGHT.

225
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,625
HOWEVER,
NOTHING HAS TURNED UP AS OF YET.

226
00:17:00,708 --> 00:17:03,958
- WHICH WOULD PROBABLY
MEAN THAT HE HAS ALREADY MADE IT

227
00:17:04,041 --> 00:17:06,791
TO THE IMMIGRANT DISTRICT
LOCATED ON THE CITY'S PERIMETER.

228
00:17:06,875 --> 00:17:10,083
- WE BELIEVE THERE'S NO REASON
TO THINK OTHERWISE.

229
00:17:10,166 --> 00:17:11,791
- THOSE ARE
MASTERLESS IMMIGRANTS.

230
00:17:11,875 --> 00:17:14,291
COULD SOMEONE OR SOMETHING
AMONGST THEM

231
00:17:14,375 --> 00:17:18,041
BE GIVING HIM HELP?
- THAT IS NOT POSSIBLE.

232
00:17:18,125 --> 00:17:21,041
THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW THAT
THE THING EXISTS.

233
00:17:21,125 --> 00:17:23,375
- THERE'S SOMETHING
WE'D LIKE TO CONFIRM.

234
00:17:23,458 --> 00:17:24,458
- WHAT IS IT?

235
00:17:24,541 --> 00:17:27,666
- IS CAPTURING IT
OUR ONLY OPTION?

236
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:30,708
- AT THIS POINT, WE'VE ACCOUNTED
FOR THE LOSS OF 41 CITIZENS.

237
00:17:30,791 --> 00:17:34,083
IN RECENT YEARS, OUR DOMED CITY
HAS ALSO SEEN NUMEROUS CASES

238
00:17:34,166 --> 00:17:36,500
OF AUTOREIVS RUNNING WILD AS
A RESULT OF THE COGITO VIRUS,

239
00:17:36,583 --> 00:17:38,291
WHOSE ORIGINS REMAIN UNKNOWN.

240
00:17:38,375 --> 00:17:40,958
SUCH INCIDENTS HAVE OFTEN
ACCOMPANIED BY A STEADY INCREASE

241
00:17:41,041 --> 00:17:42,916
IN THE NUMBER OF VICTIMS
AS WELL.

242
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,791
I'M SURE YOU'LL AGREE IT WON'T
BE LONG BEFORE A SENSE

243
00:17:44,875 --> 00:17:47,583
OF INSECURITY GROWS TAKES ROOT
AMONGST THE CITIZENS,

244
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:50,208
EVEN WHEN SUCH INFORMATION
HAS BEEN KEPT UNDER CONTROL.

245
00:17:50,291 --> 00:17:53,791
- IN THE INTEREST OF MAINTAINING
ORDER AND PUBLIC SAFETY,

246
00:17:53,875 --> 00:17:56,291
I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE PERMISSION
TO KILL IT.

247
00:18:02,083 --> 00:18:05,416
- Woman: RAUL, YOU MUST NOT TAKE
PRE-EMPTIVE ACTION.

248
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:07,125
- Man: YOU HAVE TO CAPTURE IT.

249
00:18:07,208 --> 00:18:10,208
Man #2: BY NO MEANS ARE YOU
TO KILL IT.

250
00:18:10,291 --> 00:18:12,625
- Man #3: YOU NEEDN'T WORRY
ABOUT THE LOSS

251
00:18:12,708 --> 00:18:14,500
OF A FEW CITIZENS.

252
00:18:14,583 --> 00:18:18,458
- Man #4: IF WE RUN LOW, ALL WE
DO IS INCREASE PRODUCTION.

253
00:18:18,541 --> 00:18:21,000
- Woman: YOUR MISSION IS
TO BRING HIM BACK.

254
00:18:21,083 --> 00:18:24,833
- Woman #2: YOU UNDERSTAND,
DON'T YOU, RAUL?

255
00:18:24,916 --> 00:18:27,875
- THERE'S JUST ONE LAST THING.

256
00:18:27,958 --> 00:18:31,041
WHAT IS THIS "PROXY"?

257
00:18:35,333 --> 00:18:38,291
- RE-L, SO FAR I FOUND
FOUR DEAD BODIES,

258
00:18:38,375 --> 00:18:39,875
BUT THERE'S PROBABLY MORE.

259
00:18:39,958 --> 00:18:42,666
THIS MUST BE WHAT THE SECURITY
BUREAU WANTED TO COVER UP.

260
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:46,666
- THERE'S SOMETHING
ELSE I'VE LEARNED.

261
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:48,291
- HMM?

262
00:18:48,375 --> 00:18:52,541
- THE KILLER IS NOT
A COGITO-INFECTED AUTOREIV.

263
00:18:52,625 --> 00:18:54,750
- THEN WHAT IS IT?

264
00:19:07,541 --> 00:19:10,041
THE SECURITY BUREAU
HAS ISSUED AN ORDER.

265
00:19:10,125 --> 00:19:12,166
ANY CONTINUATION
OF THIS ACTIVITY

266
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:15,291
MAY CONSTITUTE A VIOLATION
OF OFFICIAL REGULATIONS.

267
00:19:19,916 --> 00:19:22,666
- YEAH, I KNOW.

268
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:27,333
THEY TOLD US TO SAFEGUARD
THE CRIME SCENE,

269
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:29,333
- THAT'S TRUE,

270
00:19:29,416 --> 00:19:31,875
BUT--
- LET'S GO,

271
00:19:31,958 --> 00:19:34,375
BEFORE THE GUY
YOU DON'T CARE FOR GETS HERE.

272
00:19:34,458 --> 00:19:36,916
AND BESIDES,
IF WE PRESS ANY FURTHER,

273
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,666
IT LOOKS LIKE I'LL BE IN TROUBLE
WITH MY GRANDFATHER AGAIN.

274
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:42,458
- HMM?  RE-L?

275
00:19:42,541 --> 00:19:46,416
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
- DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT, IGGY.

276
00:19:50,083 --> 00:19:53,791
- I'M TERRIBLY SORRY, BUT IF
CAN SUBMIT THE PAPERS TO THE--

277
00:20:00,833 --> 00:20:02,125
- ( cell phone rings )

278
00:20:02,208 --> 00:20:05,333
- ( beeps )
- DOROTHY.

279
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:20,291
- Man: THE DESTRUCTIVE POWER
WE SEE HERE

280
00:20:20,375 --> 00:20:23,750
AND THE LEAPING ABILITY
WE SAW WHEN IT ESCAPED,

281
00:20:23,833 --> 00:20:25,125
EITHER OF THOSE THINGS
WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE

282
00:20:25,208 --> 00:20:28,416
EVEN FOR A HIGH-LEVEL AUTOREIV,
WOULDN'T YOU AGREE?

283
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:31,708
- WHAT WAS THE PURPOSE OF
CONDUCTING TOP-SECRET RESEARCH

284
00:20:31,791 --> 00:20:33,791
ON A MONSTER LIKE THIS?

285
00:20:33,875 --> 00:20:37,583
- SO THE REGENT DIDN'T TELL YOU?

286
00:20:37,666 --> 00:20:39,791
- ( growls )

287
00:20:39,875 --> 00:20:41,958
- TO BE HONEST WITH YOU,

288
00:20:42,041 --> 00:20:44,125
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
THE POINT WAS, EITHER.

289
00:20:44,208 --> 00:20:46,666
MY ASSIGNMENT WAS SIMPLY
TO LOOK AFTER THE SPECIMEN

290
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:49,083
WHILE IT REMAINED
IN A DEEP SLEEP.

291
00:20:49,166 --> 00:20:50,500
BUT STILL,

292
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:51,791
OBTAINING THAT SORT OF POWER

293
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:54,541
WOULD HAVE SIGNIFICANT
IMPLICATIONS.

294
00:20:56,875 --> 00:21:01,041
WELL, THAT'S THE FIRST THOUGHT
THAT COMES TO MIND.

295
00:21:01,125 --> 00:21:03,125
- Woman: CHIEF RAUL.

296
00:21:03,208 --> 00:21:07,375
SHE'S IN TEMPORARY
IMMIGRANT DISTRICT D.

297
00:21:07,458 --> 00:21:09,833
- RE-L MAYER?

298
00:21:15,208 --> 00:21:18,541
- SO, IGGY, I WANT YOU
TO ACCESS THE DATA BANK

299
00:21:18,625 --> 00:21:21,000
AT HEADQUARTERS AND HAVE ALL
THE CASES SIMILAR TO THIS ONE

300
00:21:21,083 --> 00:21:23,875
PUT IN A FILE.
- ROGER.

301
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:55,208
- CALLED IN BY MY GRANDFATHER.

302
00:21:55,291 --> 00:21:58,666
SIGNS OF UNREST
AT THE SECURITY BUREAU.

303
00:22:00,166 --> 00:22:02,250
AND THEN THAT.

304
00:22:09,083 --> 00:22:12,000
THE POINTS
MUST SOMEHOW BE CONNECTED.

305
00:22:17,291 --> 00:22:19,541
THIS HAS BEEN QUITE A DAY.

306
00:22:19,625 --> 00:22:22,125
( sighs )

307
00:22:57,791 --> 00:22:59,166
- ( beeps )

308
00:23:18,875 --> 00:23:20,250
- ( gasps )

309
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:39,666
