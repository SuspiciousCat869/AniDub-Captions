1
00:00:59,541 --> 00:01:02,291
- Vincent: SAD.

2
00:01:02,375 --> 00:01:04,958
INCREDIBLY SAD.

3
00:01:05,041 --> 00:01:07,958
AGAIN.

4
00:01:08,041 --> 00:01:09,958
IT'S THE DREAM AGAIN.

5
00:01:12,333 --> 00:01:14,625
AM I CRYING?

6
00:01:19,833 --> 00:01:21,708
IT'S HIM.

7
00:01:24,833 --> 00:01:26,708
( grunting )

8
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:39,791
I'M SAD.

9
00:01:39,875 --> 00:01:43,291
AND YET, I'M ALSO LAUGHING.

10
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,875
UGH!

11
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:53,625
WAS I HIT?

12
00:02:01,708 --> 00:02:04,500
TODAY'S THE DAY I SEE.

13
00:02:04,583 --> 00:02:06,041
I'M ALMOST THERE.

14
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:09,666
I'M ALMOST THERE.

15
00:02:13,916 --> 00:02:15,625
( groans )

16
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:49,166
THE DREAM.

17
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:55,166
DREAM AGAIN. ( grunts )

18
00:03:04,541 --> 00:03:06,791
( cell phone ringing )

19
00:03:22,791 --> 00:03:24,750

( sighs )

37
00:05:35,541 --> 00:05:37,250
- ( sighs )

38
00:05:48,666 --> 00:05:50,833
- WHAT'S THE MATTER?

39
00:05:52,458 --> 00:05:55,333
- IGGY'S STILL BEING MONITORED
BY MY GRANDFATHER.

40
00:05:58,375 --> 00:06:00,333
IT'S NOTHING.

41
00:06:00,416 --> 00:06:02,583
- HEY, RE-L.
TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.

42
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:07,333
THE INTELLIGENCE BUREAU'S
DATA BANKS HAVE BEEN

43
00:06:07,416 --> 00:06:09,291
ACCESSED 74 TIMES.

44
00:06:09,375 --> 00:06:11,583
- WHAT'S MORE IS THAT DURING
THE SHORT TIME THEY WERE ONLY

45
00:06:11,666 --> 00:06:14,541
ACCESSED BY UNKNOWN ACCOUNTS.
STRANGE, ISN'T IT?

46
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:16,375
- YES, IT IS.

47
00:06:18,166 --> 00:06:20,875
THEY LOGGED-ON WITH THE HIGHEST
LEVEL OF AUTHORIZATION.

48
00:06:20,958 --> 00:06:23,500
I BET THEY WERE ACCESSING IT
FROM THE SECURITY BUREAU.

49
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:25,875
- YOU WANT ME TO DO THAT?

50
00:06:25,958 --> 00:06:28,416
- SO WHAT WERE THEY LOOKING FOR?

51
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,375
WHAT THE HELL?

52
00:06:53,333 --> 00:06:55,958
- ( cell phone rings )

53
00:07:33,333 --> 00:07:34,708
- DOROTHY.

54
00:07:34,791 --> 00:07:38,375
- Dorothy:
VINCENT, OVER HERE.

55
00:07:40,041 --> 00:07:42,916
- DOROTHY, WHERE ARE YOU?

56
00:07:47,041 --> 00:07:48,958
THAT'S--

57
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,416
( shouts )

58
00:08:07,541 --> 00:08:09,958
DOROTHY.

59
00:08:10,041 --> 00:08:12,458
- VINCENT, OVER HERE.

60
00:08:14,958 --> 00:08:15,958
- NO!

61
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:41,791
DAMN IT!
WHAT THE HELL DID I DO?

62
00:08:48,708 --> 00:08:50,375
DAMN IT.

63
00:09:07,625 --> 00:09:10,583
- TARGET HAS BEEN LOST.
- CONFIRMED.

64
00:09:10,666 --> 00:09:13,541
INPUTTING UPDATED ESCAPE ROUTE
PROJECTION.

65
00:09:13,625 --> 00:09:17,666
- YOU STILL DON'T EVEN HAVE
A CLUE AS TO WHERE IT IS.

66
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:20,541
- WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU FAIL
TO MANAGE THIS?

67
00:09:20,625 --> 00:09:23,416
- EVERYTHING LEADS TO US.

68
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:26,083
- I DON'T WANT
TO HEAR ANY EXCUSES.

69
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:30,583
- BEAR IN MIND, YOU WILL NOT
BE GIVEN EVEN A MOMENT'S GRACE.

70
00:09:30,666 --> 00:09:32,708
- Woman: WE WANT
TO BE REASSURED QUICKLY.

71
00:09:32,791 --> 00:09:35,708
- Man: WE CAN REPLACE YOU
JUST AS EASILY.

72
00:09:35,791 --> 00:09:38,583
- Man #2: SINCE THERE ARE AS
MANY ENTOURAGE-TYPE AUTOREIVS

73
00:09:38,666 --> 00:09:42,583
AS THERE ARE STARS
IN THE SKY.

74
00:09:42,666 --> 00:09:44,291
- Woman #2: I UNDERSTAND.

75
00:09:54,583 --> 00:09:57,750
- ( panting )
HE'S NOT THERE, CHIEF.

76
00:09:57,833 --> 00:09:59,125
- SEARCH CAREFULLY.

77
00:09:59,208 --> 00:10:01,500
HE'S NOT JUST ANOTHER
INFECTED AUTOREIV.

78
00:10:01,583 --> 00:10:03,875
- THIS COULD BE MY CHANCE
FOR A BIG PROMOTION.

79
00:10:33,791 --> 00:10:35,375
- OH.

80
00:10:35,458 --> 00:10:37,750
- WHAT'S A COMPANION MODEL
DOING HERE?

81
00:10:37,833 --> 00:10:40,708
ARE YOU LOST?

82
00:10:40,791 --> 00:10:43,708
HMM?  YOU'RE THAT--

83
00:10:46,625 --> 00:10:50,208
YOUR NAME'S PINO,
ISN'T IT?

84
00:10:50,291 --> 00:10:52,208
- PINO?

85
00:11:02,875 --> 00:11:06,750
- ( phone beeps )

86
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:08,916
- ( busy tone playing )

87
00:11:30,541 --> 00:11:32,500
- ( busy tone playing )

88
00:11:32,583 --> 00:11:36,250
- VINCENT LAW, WHERE ARE YOU?

89
00:12:04,208 --> 00:12:07,708
- UM... UM...
IS PINO REALLY PINO?

90
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,708
IS PINO SUPPOSED TO BE PINO?

91
00:12:37,541 --> 00:12:40,166
WELL, YOU SEE,
PINO IS REALLY--

92
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:41,833
- DON'T TALK SO LOUD.

93
00:12:45,625 --> 00:12:48,166
DAMN TURING APPLICATION.

94
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:52,125
THAT'S WHY COMPANION AUTOREIVS
ACT LIKE THAT.

95
00:12:52,208 --> 00:12:55,041
PLEASE, JUST STAY THERE,
ALL RIGHT?

96
00:12:55,125 --> 00:12:57,333
- HUH?

97
00:12:57,416 --> 00:12:59,750
- ALL RIGHT, JUST STAY THERE.

98
00:12:59,833 --> 00:13:02,333
CAN YOU--
CAN YOU DO THAT?

99
00:13:02,416 --> 00:13:04,041
- ( mutters )

100
00:13:14,791 --> 00:13:16,958
- HEY, THAT'S--
- THIS?

101
00:13:17,041 --> 00:13:18,750
- ( beeps )

102
00:13:18,833 --> 00:13:21,458
( rings )

103
00:13:21,541 --> 00:13:24,291
- NO, DON'T!
- HELLO THERE.  WHO IS THIS?

104
00:13:24,375 --> 00:13:27,791
WHO IS THIS?  HELLO.

105
00:13:27,875 --> 00:13:31,041
- VINCENT, IS THAT YOU?

106
00:13:31,125 --> 00:13:34,291
- Inspector Re-l.

107
00:13:34,375 --> 00:13:36,125
- WHERE ARE YOU NOW?

108
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:42,166
- Dorothy was--
it was an armed AutoReiv.

109
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:45,291
It wasn't me.  They--
The whole thing was a trap!

110
00:13:45,375 --> 00:13:48,375
- CALM DOWN!
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

111
00:13:48,458 --> 00:13:51,541
WHY DID THIS HAVE TO
HAPPEN TO ME?

112
00:13:51,625 --> 00:13:53,375
IF I DON'T GET OUT OF HERE.

113
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:55,833
PLEASE, YOU'VE GOTTA HELP ME.

114
00:13:55,916 --> 00:13:59,166
I DON'T-- I DON'T HAVE ANYONE
ELSE TO TURN TO.

115
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:00,708
I'M BEGGING YOU.

116
00:14:00,791 --> 00:14:03,500
- WHAT CAN YOU SEE FROM THERE?

117
00:14:03,583 --> 00:14:05,250
- I'VE GOT TO GET OUT OF HERE.

118
00:14:05,333 --> 00:14:06,458
- ( metal screeching )

119
00:14:09,458 --> 00:14:12,500
- OH!  LIGHT RAIL CROSSING.

120
00:14:16,333 --> 00:14:17,750
A LITTLE FURTHER
AND THERE'S A--

121
00:14:17,833 --> 00:14:20,000
ARE YOU TRYING TO LEAVE
THROUGH THE PLUG VENT?

122
00:14:20,083 --> 00:14:22,000
- I can't take it anymore.

123
00:14:22,083 --> 00:14:25,083
If they're gonna kill me, I
might as well go to the outside.

124
00:14:25,166 --> 00:14:27,666
- AND YOU'LL FIND DEATH WAITING
FOR YOU.

125
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:29,208
- I'm sorry.

126
00:14:29,291 --> 00:14:31,541
Doesn't look like I'll be
becoming a fellow citizen.

127
00:14:31,625 --> 00:14:33,708
- VINCENT!
- I'M GLAD I COULD HEAR

128
00:14:33,791 --> 00:14:35,958
YOUR VOICE ONE LAST TIME.
- I'M GOING TO MEET YOU

129
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:38,750
AT THE PLUG VENT.
JUST WAIT FOR ME.

130
00:14:38,833 --> 00:14:40,500
Vincent!

131
00:14:48,208 --> 00:14:50,125
- DAMN IT!

132
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:18,541
DAMN IT!

133
00:15:18,625 --> 00:15:20,125
- HUH?

134
00:15:20,208 --> 00:15:23,750
- LET'S LOOK FOR ANOTHER WAY.
- YOU DON'T NEED IT?

135
00:15:23,833 --> 00:15:25,791
- IT'S HEAVY.

136
00:15:31,666 --> 00:15:35,291
- WAIT FOR ME.

137
00:15:45,208 --> 00:15:46,791
- THE SECURITY BUREAU.

138
00:16:11,833 --> 00:16:14,791
- CAN'T GO THIS WAY, EITHER.

139
00:16:16,416 --> 00:16:17,583
- ( shouts )

140
00:16:26,375 --> 00:16:28,083
IS THIS A MAZE?

141
00:16:28,166 --> 00:16:30,083
LET ME HAVE THE BAG.

142
00:16:30,166 --> 00:16:33,708
MAYBE THERE'S SOMETHING IN THERE
WE CAN USE FOR A LIGHT.

143
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:37,208
PINO?  PINO!

144
00:16:52,416 --> 00:16:54,458
- THIS WAY.

145
00:16:57,125 --> 00:17:00,250
- COULD IT BE?
DOES SHE KNOW?

146
00:17:03,041 --> 00:17:07,000
- AGENT RE-L, WHERE ARE YOU
GOING IN SUCH A HURRY?

147
00:17:07,083 --> 00:17:09,875
I NOTICE THAT YOU DIDN'T BRING
YOUR ENTOURAGE WITH YOU, EITHER.

148
00:17:09,958 --> 00:17:11,500
- I'M GOING TO INSPECT
THE CRIME SCENE

149
00:17:11,583 --> 00:17:13,375
IN THE IMMIGRANT RESIDENT
DISTRICT.

150
00:17:13,458 --> 00:17:16,583
AS FOR MY ENTOURAGE,
HE'S 15 MINUTES BEHIND ME.

151
00:17:16,666 --> 00:17:19,250
- I'M SORRY FOR THE DELAY.

152
00:17:19,333 --> 00:17:21,750
GO AHEAD
AND PLEASE BE CAREFUL.

153
00:17:29,833 --> 00:17:33,166
ALL OF THE AUTOREIV'S INFECTED
WITH THE COGITO VIRUS

154
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:36,250
FOLLOWED THE SAME ROUTE,
DIDN'T THEY?

155
00:17:39,208 --> 00:17:41,750
IT DOESN'T MATTER
NOW THOUGH, DOES IT?

156
00:17:47,125 --> 00:17:48,333
- ( laughs )

157
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:59,166
- IT'S A DEAD END, ISN'T IT?

158
00:18:01,083 --> 00:18:02,750
( grunts )

159
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:06,083
HEY!

160
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:17,875
- HER INTUITION IS FAR TOO KEEN.

161
00:18:17,958 --> 00:18:20,708
- I WONDER WHO
SHE MUST TAKE AFTER.

162
00:18:20,791 --> 00:18:22,541
- THE CITIZENS ARE ALL MODELED

163
00:18:22,625 --> 00:18:25,208
ON PRE-ARRANGED INFORMATION.

164
00:18:25,291 --> 00:18:28,833
LOCAL APPROXIMATIONS
ARE MEANINGLESS.

165
00:18:28,916 --> 00:18:30,500
- I KNEW WE SHOULDN'T
HAVE ASSIGNED HER

166
00:18:30,583 --> 00:18:32,833
TO THE INTELLIGENCE BUREAU.

167
00:18:32,916 --> 00:18:36,166
- NO, FROM AN EDUCATIONAL
POINT OF VIEW,

168
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:38,125
IT WAS THE RIGHT DECISION.

169
00:18:38,208 --> 00:18:40,208
THE DATA SHOWS
AT THE CITIZEN LEVEL

170
00:18:40,291 --> 00:18:42,958
HER MAXIMUM SENSITIVITY
HAS BEEN MAINTAINED.

171
00:18:43,041 --> 00:18:45,166
A MOST SPLENDID OUTCOME.

172
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:47,125
- BUT IT IS THE DYNAMIC ENERGY
DERIVED FROM THAT,

173
00:18:47,208 --> 00:18:48,833
WHICH IS THE MAIN CULPRIT.

174
00:18:48,916 --> 00:18:52,250
- SPEAKING OF CULPRITS, WHAT
ABOUT THE SECURITY BUREAU?

175
00:18:52,333 --> 00:18:54,291
- Man:
THERE'S NO CAUSE FOR CONCERN.

176
00:18:54,375 --> 00:18:56,375
WE'VE MADE OURSELVES VERY CLEAR.

177
00:18:56,458 --> 00:18:58,208
- Woman:
HOWEVER, THERE'S NO DENYING

178
00:18:58,291 --> 00:18:59,833
THAT OUR ROMDEAU
HAS BEEN SHAKEN.

179
00:18:59,916 --> 00:19:01,708
- Man #2:
WE MUST TAKE SWIFT ACTION

180
00:19:01,791 --> 00:19:06,041
TO RESOLVE THE SITUATION
IMMEDIATELY.  OTHERWISE...

181
00:19:06,125 --> 00:19:08,541
- Woman #2:
ITS RAISON D'ETRE WILL COLLAPSE.

182
00:19:08,625 --> 00:19:11,125
THAT IS OUR ONLY CAUSE
FOR CONCERN.

183
00:19:21,416 --> 00:19:24,791
- I KNOW YOU'RE HERE.
AREN'T YOU, VINCENT?

184
00:19:24,875 --> 00:19:27,791
I CAME HERE BY MYSELF.

185
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:31,750
I'M ALSO COMPLETELY UNARMED.

186
00:19:35,125 --> 00:19:36,250
- Vincent: WAIT.

187
00:19:42,083 --> 00:19:43,791
- HELLO THERE.

188
00:19:50,875 --> 00:19:52,291
- COME ON OUT, VINCENT.

189
00:19:56,166 --> 00:19:58,791
- INSPECTOR RE-L.

190
00:19:58,875 --> 00:20:01,041
I--

191
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:06,416
- I NEED TO KNOW,

192
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:09,166
WHY IS THE SECURITY BUREAU
CHASING YOU?

193
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:10,708
- I DON'T KNOW.

194
00:20:10,791 --> 00:20:13,083
- WHAT DID YOU SEE
IN THE BATHROOM?

195
00:20:13,166 --> 00:20:16,125
TELL ME.
- THE BATHROOM?

196
00:20:16,208 --> 00:20:18,291
- THEN HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN THIS?

197
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,750
- HOW?  WHERE WAS IT?

198
00:20:23,916 --> 00:20:25,583
- THE MONSTER.

199
00:20:28,583 --> 00:20:31,625
- YOU MEAN THAT THING.

200
00:20:31,708 --> 00:20:34,708
- WHAT DID YOU SEE?
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

201
00:20:34,791 --> 00:20:36,750
I WAS SUDDENLY ATTACKED
IN THE MALL

202
00:20:36,833 --> 00:20:40,875
AND THE SECURITY BUREAU
CAME AFTER ME.

203
00:20:40,958 --> 00:20:44,000
INSPECTOR,
I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

204
00:20:44,083 --> 00:20:45,791
WHY IS THIS HAPPENING
TO ME?

205
00:20:45,875 --> 00:20:49,333
- YOU SAW THE MONSTER.
THE PROXY.

206
00:20:49,416 --> 00:20:51,375
YOU KNOW.

207
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:53,750
- PROXY?

208
00:21:00,458 --> 00:21:02,583
- VINCENT LAW,
STAY WHERE YOU ARE

209
00:21:02,666 --> 00:21:05,708
AND DO EXACTLY AS I TELL YOU.

210
00:21:07,291 --> 00:21:09,208
- THE SECURITY BUREAU.

211
00:21:11,083 --> 00:21:13,000
- YOU LIAR!
- VINCENT, I DIDN'T CALL THEM.

212
00:21:13,083 --> 00:21:15,208
- THEN WHO? ( gasps )

213
00:21:34,083 --> 00:21:36,083
- OUTSIDE.

214
00:21:36,166 --> 00:21:38,041
- STOP IT.

215
00:21:43,208 --> 00:21:45,666
- ( grunting )

216
00:21:52,458 --> 00:21:53,625
- Re-l: VINCENT!

217
00:21:57,833 --> 00:22:00,125
IGGY, I HAVE TO SAVE VINCENT.

218
00:22:00,208 --> 00:22:02,416
- DON'T BE A FOOL.

219
00:22:03,916 --> 00:22:05,583
- VINCENT!

220
00:22:11,333 --> 00:22:14,875
- IN MY DESPERATE ATTEMPTS
TO BECOME A FELLOW CITIZEN,

221
00:22:14,958 --> 00:22:18,375
I'VE CONSTANTLY
SUPPRESSED MYSELF

222
00:22:18,458 --> 00:22:21,541
AND TRIED TO BE THE PERSON
I THOUGHT THEY WANTED.

223
00:22:21,625 --> 00:22:24,041
CONSTANTLY.  EVERYWHERE.

224
00:22:24,125 --> 00:22:26,208
- Re-l: VINCENT!

225
00:22:26,291 --> 00:22:28,416
- AND LOOK WHAT'S HAPPENED
TO ME.

226
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:32,500
I'M A FAILURE.

227
00:22:47,916 --> 00:22:49,791
- VINCENT!

228
00:22:51,125 --> 00:22:53,666
LISTEN, I'LL TALK
TO MY GRANDFATHER.

229
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:55,291
THE SECURITY BUREAU WON'T
BE ABLE TO TOUCH YOU.

230
00:22:57,375 --> 00:22:59,916
- DOUBTING THE SYSTEM IS BAD.

231
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,833
ALWAYS OBEY.

232
00:23:02,916 --> 00:23:06,458
THOSE ARE THE CONDITIONS
FOR BEING A FELLOW CITIZEN.

233
00:23:06,541 --> 00:23:07,958
- DON'T DO IT.

234
00:23:08,041 --> 00:23:11,416
- BUT I'LL NEVER BECOME
A FELLOW CITIZEN.

235
00:23:16,833 --> 00:23:18,166
IT'S OVER.

236
00:23:24,333 --> 00:23:28,083
- WHY ARE THEY CLOSING IT?
WE MUST CAPTURE HIM.

237
00:23:28,166 --> 00:23:30,958
- KEEPING IT OPEN ANY LONGER
WILL EXPOSE THE ENTIRE CITY

238
00:23:31,041 --> 00:23:32,333
TO DANGER.

239
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:41,958
- VINCENT, WAIT!

240
00:23:52,416 --> 00:23:54,791
VINCENT.

241
00:24:03,125 --> 00:24:05,666
- IT'S OVER.

242
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:07,333
MY LIFE.

243
00:24:07,416 --> 00:24:09,291
IT'S ALL OVER.

00:24:50,291 --> 00:24:54,166

THE LABYRINTHINE MYSTERIES
THAT STILL REMAIN.

253

ULTERIOR MOTIVES HIDE BEHIND
THE SCENES IN PARADISE

AND BECKON THE LOST
TO THE LAND OF HADES.
