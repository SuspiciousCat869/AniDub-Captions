1
00:00:32,916 --> 00:00:35,791
- Will B. Good: COME ON NOW,
EVERYONE WAKE UP.

2
00:00:35,875 --> 00:00:37,791
IT'S ALMOST SHOWTIME.

3
00:00:37,875 --> 00:00:39,791
JUST WATCH THIS.

4
00:00:54,583 --> 00:00:56,333
- HELLO?

5
00:01:10,291 --> 00:01:12,166
WHERE AM I?

6
00:01:16,208 --> 00:01:19,708
- MY NAME IS AL.  I'M THE SHORT
ONE WHO'S ALWAYS HUNGRY.

7
00:01:19,791 --> 00:01:22,916
- I'M PULL.  I'M THE TALL ONE
WHO'S GOT THE ATTITUDE.

8
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,333
- AND TOGETHER WE ARE KNOWN
AS THE TWO AMIGOS.

9
00:01:28,541 --> 00:01:30,666
- WHERE IS THIS PLACE?

10
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:34,000
- YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE YOU ARE?
TOO-DOO!

11
00:01:34,083 --> 00:01:37,166
THIS IS THE HOME OF HAPPINESS
AND ETERNAL SMILES.

12
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:40,458
WELCOME, YOUNG LADY,
TO SMILE LAND.

13
00:01:40,541 --> 00:01:42,833

- ( fireworks popping )

33
00:03:36,458 --> 00:03:39,208
- ( people chattering )

34
00:03:45,041 --> 00:03:46,958
- Al: WELCOME TO SMILE LAND,

35
00:03:47,041 --> 00:03:49,791
THE AMAZING AMUSEMENT CITY
DEDICATED TO PUTTING

36
00:03:49,875 --> 00:03:53,000
A PERMANENT SMILE ON THE FACE
OF EACH AND EVERY CUSTOMER.

37
00:03:53,083 --> 00:03:55,458
- Pull: THAT'S RIGHT.
THIS ENTIRE TOWN

38
00:03:55,541 --> 00:03:57,458
HAS BEEN TRANSFORMED
TOP TO BOTTOM

39
00:03:57,541 --> 00:03:59,458
INTO A FANTASTIC
ADVENTURE PARK.

40
00:03:59,541 --> 00:04:01,875
- Al: BECAUSE OF THAT,
EVERY MAN, WOMAN AND KIDDIE

41
00:04:01,958 --> 00:04:03,875
IS ALWAYS LAUGHING
AND SMILING

42
00:04:03,958 --> 00:04:06,333
AND HAVING THE TIME OF THEIR
LIVES ALL YEAR LONG.

43
00:04:06,416 --> 00:04:08,875
- Pull: AND OF COURSE,
IN ORDER TO KEEP A SMILE

44
00:04:08,958 --> 00:04:11,958
ON EVERYBODY'S FACE, THEY GOTTA
KEEP WORKING HARD TO COME UP

45
00:04:12,041 --> 00:04:14,958
WITH BRAND-NEW ANIMALS
AND CHARACTERS ALL THE TIME.

46
00:04:15,041 --> 00:04:18,250
- Al: AND THEY GOTTA WORK HARD
TO MAKE SURE ALL THE ATTRACTIONS

47
00:04:18,333 --> 00:04:20,291
AND CHARACTERS
THAT PEOPLE ARE TIRED OF

48
00:04:20,375 --> 00:04:22,416
ARE GONE
BEFORE YOU KNOW IT.

49
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:23,916
AND THAT'S
WHERE WE ARE.

50
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,750
- THE FABULOUS GARBAGE DUMP
OF SMILE LAND.

51
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:28,875
- ( metallic bang )
- HUH?

52
00:04:31,541 --> 00:04:33,416
( both scream )

53
00:04:39,125 --> 00:04:40,708
- WHEW.

54
00:04:40,791 --> 00:04:42,208
- THAT WAS CLOSE.

55
00:04:42,291 --> 00:04:44,958
- BY THE WAY,
WHAT'S YOUR NAME, YOUNG LADY?

56
00:04:45,041 --> 00:04:47,166
- AND WHAT BRINGS YOU
TO THIS NECK OF THE WOODS?

57
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:50,000
- I'M PINO.  I WAS ON A TRIP
WITH VINCE AND RE-L.

58
00:04:50,083 --> 00:04:52,000
WE WERE ALL RIDING
ON THE RABBIT.

59
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:54,000
- SHE SAY VINCE?

60
00:04:54,083 --> 00:04:55,791
- AND RE-L?

61
00:04:55,875 --> 00:04:57,291
- AND DO YOU
KNOW THEM?

62
00:04:57,375 --> 00:04:59,125
- WE'VE NEVER HEARD
OF THEM.

63
00:04:59,208 --> 00:05:03,083
BUT WE'RE KNOWN THE WHOLE WIDE
WORLD OVER AS THE TWO AMIGOS!

64
00:05:03,166 --> 00:05:05,208
( both laugh )

65
00:05:05,291 --> 00:05:07,208
- I WONDER.

66
00:05:07,291 --> 00:05:09,541
DO YOU THINK
I'VE BEEN THROWN AWAY TOO?

67
00:05:09,625 --> 00:05:12,166
WHAT DO I DO
ABOUT THIS?

68
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:14,166
- WHAT TO DO?
WHAT TO DO?

69
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:16,583
- MAN, THIS IS QUITE A PICKLE.
- THAT'S IT!

70
00:05:16,666 --> 00:05:18,833
- WHEN YOU'RE IN TROUBLE,
ASK SOMEONE FOR HELP.

71
00:05:18,916 --> 00:05:20,333
- ALL RIGHT!

72
00:05:20,416 --> 00:05:22,666
- YOU SEE, THE TWO OF US
ARE IN A BIT OF A STICKY

73
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:25,125
SITUATION OURSELVES.
- THIS IS PERFECT.

74
00:05:25,208 --> 00:05:27,458
NOW WE'RE ALL
IN A MESS TOGETHER.

75
00:05:27,541 --> 00:05:29,458
- Pino: WHO ARE YOU GOING
TO ASK FOR HELP?

76
00:05:29,541 --> 00:05:31,708
- ( eyes whirring )
- Al: THAT'S A SILLY QUESTION.

77
00:05:31,791 --> 00:05:34,041
- Both: WE'RE GOING TO ASK
THE CREATOR OF SMILE LAND

78
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:36,500
TO HELP US--
THE INCREDIBLE

79
00:05:36,583 --> 00:05:38,750
MR. WILL B. GOOD.

80
00:05:42,291 --> 00:05:44,750
- STICK TO THE SCRIPT,
WILL YA?

81
00:05:46,083 --> 00:05:48,750
WE DON'T HAVE TIME
FOR YOUR SHENANIGANS.

82
00:05:48,833 --> 00:05:50,750
- SO YOU THINK
HE'S AN INFORMANT?

83
00:05:50,833 --> 00:05:53,083
- IT'S OBVIOUS
WE'RE BEING BUGGED.

84
00:05:53,166 --> 00:05:55,125
- DON'T YOU TALK TO ME
LIKE I'M NOT HERE.

85
00:05:55,208 --> 00:05:57,666
I AIN'T GONNA LET YOU
WALK ALL OVER ME.

86
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:59,250
- WHO ARE YOU?

87
00:05:59,333 --> 00:06:01,416
- OH, BROTHER,
YOU'RE A BIT THICK, AIN'T YA?

88
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:04,208
LITTLE GIRL, I'M THIS EPISODE'S
SPECIAL GUEST.

89
00:06:04,291 --> 00:06:07,000
YOU'RE GONNA NEED MORE HELP
THAN THESE TWO LOUSES CAN GIVE.

90
00:06:07,083 --> 00:06:09,458
SHEESH, I'VE BEEN
LOOKING ALL OVER FOR YOU.

91
00:06:09,541 --> 00:06:12,250
HOW'D YOU GET MIXED UP
WITH THESE TWO DIMWITS?

92
00:06:12,333 --> 00:06:14,666
FOR THE RECORD,
I'M ROGI THE CRICKET.

93
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:16,416
PLEASED TO MEET YA.
- MY NAME'S PINO

94
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,416
AND I'M KIND OF LOOKING
FOR VINCE AND RE-L.

95
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,416
- ( snaps fingers )
JUST AS I SUSPECTED.

96
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,416
- DO YOU KNOW WHERE THEY ARE?
- OF COURSE.

97
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:25,250
AND IF YOU COME WITH ME
TO WILL B. GOOD'S HOUSE,

98
00:06:25,333 --> 00:06:27,541
YOU'LL FIND OUT
WHERE THEY ARE.  ALLEY-OOP!

99
00:06:27,625 --> 00:06:29,541
LET'S GO!

100
00:06:29,625 --> 00:06:31,041
- WHAT ABOUT--?

101
00:06:31,125 --> 00:06:33,541
- Pull: HMM, UM...
- Al: LET'S SEE...

102
00:06:33,625 --> 00:06:36,041
- OH, THOSE TWO?

103
00:06:36,125 --> 00:06:38,958
YOU DON'T NEED THEM
ANYMORE.

104
00:06:39,041 --> 00:06:40,458
- HUH?

105
00:06:40,541 --> 00:06:42,583
- EH, DON'T SWEAT
THE DETAILS.

106
00:06:42,666 --> 00:06:45,291
THIS STUFF'S AS STRONG
AS A SPIDER'S SILK.

107
00:06:45,375 --> 00:06:47,416
- ( low rumbling )
- UH...

108
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,708
- GRAB ON!
- ( whimpering )

109
00:07:27,625 --> 00:07:30,458
- I'M SORRY YOU LOST
ALL YOUR NOTES.

110
00:07:30,541 --> 00:07:32,458
- YEAH, THAT'S OKAY.

111
00:07:32,541 --> 00:07:35,166
WE FIGURED JUST ASKING FOR HELP
WOULDN'T BE ENOUGH,

112
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:37,625
SO WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO TAKE
SOME DIRECT ACTION.

113
00:07:37,708 --> 00:07:40,666
- KNOCK IT OFF.  WHY ARE YOU
GUYS STILL FOLLOWING US?

114
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:42,416
- WE'RE GOING TO GO SEE
WILL B. GOOD

115
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:45,125
TO FIND OUT WHY WE WERE BORN.
HE'S GOTTA KNOW.

116
00:07:45,208 --> 00:07:47,666
AFTER ALL,
IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT,

117
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:51,041
HE'S THE ONE WHO CREATED US
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

118
00:07:51,125 --> 00:07:52,583
- WHAT PHOOEY.

119
00:07:52,666 --> 00:07:55,333
YOU JUST COMPLETELY CHANGED WHAT
YOU SAID IN THE FIRST PLACE.

120
00:07:55,416 --> 00:07:57,500
I BET YOU'RE NOT EVEN
LISTENING ANYMORE.

121
00:07:57,583 --> 00:08:00,041
- THERE MUST BE SOME REASON
WE WERE CREATED.

122
00:08:00,125 --> 00:08:02,291
- AND THAT'S JUST WHAT WE'RE
PLANNING ON FINDING OUT.

123
00:08:02,375 --> 00:08:04,583
- A REASON?  WOW.

124
00:08:04,666 --> 00:08:06,500
- EITHER WAY,

125
00:08:06,583 --> 00:08:09,958
IT DOESN'T MATTER, 'CAUSE
THIS STORY AIN'T ABOUT YOU.

126
00:08:10,041 --> 00:08:12,000
SO YOU TWO
GET OUT OF HERE.

127
00:08:12,083 --> 00:08:14,708
- BUT WE WANT TO SEE WILL.
- WE'RE COMING.

128
00:08:14,791 --> 00:08:18,041
- CAN WE BRING AL AND PULL
ALONG WITH US?  OH, PLEASE?

129
00:08:18,125 --> 00:08:20,166
- ( sighs )

130
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:23,208
I KNEW WE SHOULD HAVE JUST
LEFT THEM BEHIND.

131
00:08:23,291 --> 00:08:26,458
I KNOW--
LET'S DEAL.

132
00:08:26,541 --> 00:08:29,833
I'LL LET THE TWO MAROONS
TAG ALONG WITH US

133
00:08:29,916 --> 00:08:32,750
IF YOU AGREE
TO ANSWER A QUESTION.

134
00:08:32,833 --> 00:08:35,083
- WHAT?
- YOUR FRIEND VINCE--

135
00:08:35,166 --> 00:08:37,083
WHAT KIND OF PERSON
IS HE?

136
00:08:37,166 --> 00:08:39,083
- VINCE IS
REALLY KIND TO ME.

137
00:08:39,166 --> 00:08:41,083
AND HE LOVES ME
VERY MUCH.

138
00:08:41,166 --> 00:08:43,541
AND BECAUSE
VINCE LOVES RE-L A LOT,

139
00:08:43,625 --> 00:08:45,916
I LOVE BOTH OF THEM
A LOT TOO.

140
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,083
- UH, THAT'S NOT THE SORT
OF THING I WAS TALKING ABOUT,

141
00:08:50,166 --> 00:08:52,083
MORE LIKE
WHAT MAKES VINCE VINCE.

142
00:08:52,166 --> 00:08:56,416
- I DON'T KNOW, BUT HE LIKES TO
WORRY ABOUT STUFF ALL THE TIME.

143
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,791
OH, AND THEN
SOMETIMES

144
00:08:58,875 --> 00:09:01,083
HE'LL CHANGE AND GET
REALLY BIG AND STRONG.

145
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:03,083
- GOTCHA.

146
00:09:03,166 --> 00:09:06,541
SO DOES VINCE HAVE
ANY KIND OF WEAKNESSES?

147
00:09:06,625 --> 00:09:07,875
- HUH?

148
00:09:07,958 --> 00:09:10,041
- Al: HEY!
- Pull: PINO!

149
00:09:10,125 --> 00:09:12,708
- OVER HERE!
- COME TAKE A LOOK!

150
00:09:15,166 --> 00:09:17,875
- SHEESH, WE DON'T HAVE
TIME FOR THIS.

151
00:09:19,166 --> 00:09:21,333
- ( band playing waltz )

152
00:09:28,916 --> 00:09:30,875
- ( horn honks )
- ( screams )

153
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:33,041
ARGH.
- Al and Pull: WHOOPS.

154
00:09:36,708 --> 00:09:38,625
- WOW, THAT WAS SCARY.

155
00:09:38,708 --> 00:09:41,041
- SURPRISING, HUH?
IT'S THE COOLEST.

156
00:09:41,125 --> 00:09:44,333
- LOOKS LIKE FUN.
WISH I WERE A CUSTOMER.

157
00:09:44,416 --> 00:09:48,083
- BOY, IT SURE DOES.
WISH I WERE A CUSTOMER.

158
00:09:48,166 --> 00:09:52,583
- BUT TOGETHER,
WE ARE THE THREE AMIGOS!

159
00:09:52,666 --> 00:09:54,750
- COME ON,

160
00:09:54,833 --> 00:09:57,333

161
00:09:57,416 --> 00:10:00,833
ARGH!  HEY!
DON'T YOU DARE GO OUTSIDE!

162
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:10,166
- AMAZING.

163
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:12,166
- MM-HMM.
( giggles )

164
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:15,125
- THEY'VE GOT A LOT
OF THESE POSTERS AROUND.

165
00:10:15,208 --> 00:10:17,250
- Al: APPARENTLY IT'S
TO LET EVERYONE KNOW

166
00:10:17,333 --> 00:10:19,250
THAT THE WORLD
IS COMING TO AN END.

167
00:10:19,333 --> 00:10:22,166
- Pull: GOT NOTHING TO DO
WITH US THOUGH, RIGHT?

168
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:24,750
- HEY, LAMEBRAIN,
YOU BORN YESTERDAY?

169
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:26,958
"EVERYONE" INCLUDES
YOU AND ME TOO.

170
00:10:27,041 --> 00:10:28,958
IT'S THE END
OF THE WHOLE WORLD.

171
00:10:29,041 --> 00:10:31,375
ARMAGEDDON IS
COMING SOON!

172
00:10:31,458 --> 00:10:33,375
ARE YOU STILL
IGNORING ME?

173
00:10:33,458 --> 00:10:36,208
- I HEARD MR. GOOD'S BEEN
LOCKED UP IN HIS ROOM FOR AGES

174
00:10:36,291 --> 00:10:38,208
WORKING ON SOME GREAT
NEW STORY.

175
00:10:38,291 --> 00:10:39,791
- YEAH, I HEARD
THAT TOO.

176
00:10:39,875 --> 00:10:41,791
I ALSO HEARD
HE'S GOT WRITER'S BLOCK.

177
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:45,083
- OH, FOR THE LOVE OF PETE, JUST
FORGET ABOUT ALL THAT, WILL YOU?

178
00:10:45,166 --> 00:10:47,208
LET'S HURRY UP
AND GET OVER TO WILL'S PLACE.

179
00:10:47,291 --> 00:10:48,541
COME ON, PEOPLE.

180
00:10:48,625 --> 00:10:50,333
- HELLO THERE.
- HUH?

181
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:52,333
- DO ALL OF YOU HAVE
YOUR PARK PASSES?

182
00:10:52,416 --> 00:10:54,708
- NO.
- NO.

183
00:10:54,791 --> 00:10:57,958
- SO, THOUGHT YOU COULD JUST
RIDE FOR FREE, EH?

184
00:10:59,291 --> 00:11:01,250
- I TOLD YOU SO.

185
00:11:02,458 --> 00:11:03,958
- PINO!
- RUN!

186
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:08,666
- AFTER HER!
- COME BACK!

187
00:11:11,291 --> 00:11:13,833
- WOW, THIS IS COOL.

188
00:11:13,916 --> 00:11:16,250
- YOU'RE COMING WITH ME.
- HOP!

189
00:11:16,333 --> 00:11:18,125
- Woman: LOOK,
IT'S A LITTLE GIRL.

190
00:11:18,208 --> 00:11:20,416
- OH...
- NOW!

191
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:22,625
( both groan )
- ( laughs )

192
00:11:22,708 --> 00:11:24,333
- Man: THIS IS COOL.
- HOP!

193
00:11:24,416 --> 00:11:25,833
- Woman: LOOK AT
HER SMILE.

194
00:11:25,916 --> 00:11:28,583
- IT'S SO NATURAL.
- HOP!  HOP!

195
00:11:30,208 --> 00:11:31,541
( giggles )

196
00:11:31,625 --> 00:11:34,041
- I'VE NEVER SEEN
A SMILE LIKE THAT.

197
00:11:34,125 --> 00:11:35,750
- HOP!

198
00:11:35,833 --> 00:11:37,708
( giggles )

199
00:11:38,833 --> 00:11:41,375
- LOOK AT THAT.
- YEAH.

200
00:11:41,458 --> 00:11:42,958
IT'S JUST SO NATURAL.

201
00:11:44,541 --> 00:11:46,625
- PINO!

202
00:11:46,708 --> 00:11:48,375
- THIS RIDE IS OVER.

203
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:49,750
- OH.

204
00:11:49,833 --> 00:11:52,375
HUH?  ARGH!

205
00:11:52,458 --> 00:11:53,833
- PINO!

206
00:11:55,666 --> 00:11:58,916
- ( sighs )

207
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,208
- ( cheering and applause )

208
00:12:03,958 --> 00:12:08,125
- NO!  I WON'T HAVE
ANY AD-LIBBING IN SMILE LAND.

209
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,916
- THAT WAS
REALLY GREAT, PINO.

210
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,916
- IT LOOKED LIKE
A LOT OF FUN, PINO.

211
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,583
- IT WAS A LOT OF FUN,
PINO,

212
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:31,750
'CAUSE IT KIND OF REMINDED ME
OF THIS ONE TIME

213
00:12:31,833 --> 00:12:35,125
A LONG TIME AGO THAT MY PAPA
TOOK ME TO THE SHOPPING MALL.

214
00:12:35,208 --> 00:12:38,375
- WOW, I DIDN'T KNOW
MACHINES HAD PAPAS.

215
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:41,166
- BUT I HAVEN'T SEEN HIM
FOR A REALLY LONG TIME.

216
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:44,708
- HOW SAD.
YOUR PAPA-- YOU MISS HIM?

217
00:12:44,791 --> 00:12:46,875
- MM...
HUH-UH.

218
00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:48,166
I'M OKAY NOW.

219
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:51,250
- HOW?
HE'S YOUR PAPA.

220
00:12:51,333 --> 00:12:54,166
- I HAVE REALLY GOOD FRIENDS
WHO TAKE CARE OF ME NOW.

221
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:56,625
- YOU MEAN VINCE AND...

222
00:12:56,708 --> 00:12:59,458
- RE-L?
I HOPE YOU FIND THEM.

223
00:12:59,541 --> 00:13:01,000
- MM.

224
00:13:01,083 --> 00:13:02,500
HOW ABOUT YOU TWO?

225
00:13:02,583 --> 00:13:04,958
WHAT WILL YOU DO
AFTER YOU SEE MR. GOOD?

226
00:13:05,041 --> 00:13:08,958
- HMM, WELL, THE ATTRACTION
WE LIVED IN IS LONG GONE NOW.

227
00:13:09,041 --> 00:13:12,416
- AHA!  I THINK I'D LIKE
TO TRY BEING A CUSTOMER.

228
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:15,916
- WOW, I WAS JUST ABOUT TO SAY
THE SAME THING.

229
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,791
- GET A CLUE.  YOU GUYS
KEEP CHANGING WHAT YOU WANT.

230
00:13:18,875 --> 00:13:20,958
AND YOU'RE STILL
NOT LISTENING TO ME.

231
00:13:21,041 --> 00:13:22,500
- A CUSTOMER?

232
00:13:22,583 --> 00:13:24,375
- AS A CUSTOMER...

233
00:13:24,458 --> 00:13:27,875
- WE COULD KEEP
SMILING FOREVER.

234
00:13:27,958 --> 00:13:29,875
- ( lights clang )

235
00:13:29,958 --> 00:13:31,875
- DO YOU PEOPLE
HAVE ANY IDEA

236
00:13:31,958 --> 00:13:34,375
HOW MUCH TROUBLE
YOU'RE IN?

237
00:13:34,458 --> 00:13:36,750
( grunts )

238
00:13:38,333 --> 00:13:39,875
- HUH?

239
00:13:39,958 --> 00:13:42,416
- HERE YOU GO,
INSPECTOR POOCH.

240
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:43,583
- ( clears throat )

241
00:13:43,666 --> 00:13:46,583
LET'S SEE.
NOW WHO'S FIRST?

242
00:13:46,666 --> 00:13:48,583
LET'S START WITH
THE LITTLE GUY.

243
00:13:48,666 --> 00:13:50,083
ROGI, HUH?

244
00:13:50,166 --> 00:13:52,583
YOU'RE A SURVEILLANCE TYPE
AUTOREIV, RIGHT?

245
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:54,833
AND YOU TWO,
AL AND PULL--

246
00:13:54,916 --> 00:13:57,208
YOU'RE BOTH
ENTERTAINMENT TYPE AUTOREIVS.

247
00:13:57,291 --> 00:13:58,791
SAYS HERE
YOU'RE MEMBERS

248
00:13:58,875 --> 00:14:01,750
OF THE COMMEDIA DELL'ARTE
ATTRACTION.

249
00:14:01,833 --> 00:14:03,791
- FOR YOU.
- WHAT?

250
00:14:03,875 --> 00:14:06,666
THIS SAYS THAT THE COMMEDIA
DELL'ARTE WAS SHUT DOWN.

251
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:09,541
YOU TWO SHOULD ALREADY BE
IN THE GARBAGE BIN.

252
00:14:11,416 --> 00:14:13,291
AND YOU ARE
OUR BIGGEST PROBLEM.

253
00:14:13,375 --> 00:14:16,125
WE DON'T HAVE ANY RECORD
OF YOU AT ALL.

254
00:14:16,208 --> 00:14:17,916
- PINO.

255
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,250
- YOU'RE WHO?
- I'M PINO.

256
00:14:20,333 --> 00:14:22,250
- ARGH!
SWEET BISCUIT!

257
00:14:22,333 --> 00:14:24,583
- SIR, SHE'S SMILING
SPONTANEOUSLY.

258
00:14:24,666 --> 00:14:27,041
- GET A HOLD OF YOURSELF,
LIEUTENANT KITTY.

259
00:14:27,125 --> 00:14:28,458
- BUT SIR--

260
00:14:28,541 --> 00:14:31,791
- YES, IT CERTAINLY IS
A VERY REALISTIC-LOOKING SMILE.

261
00:14:31,875 --> 00:14:35,625
MUST BE NEW SOFTWARE.
- NO, IT'S NOT SOFTWARE.

262
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:39,083
I GOT A SOUL AFTER I MET
MY FRIENDS VINCE AND RE-L.

263
00:14:39,166 --> 00:14:41,958
THAT'S WHY I CAN SMILE
WHENEVER I'M FEELING HAPPY.

264
00:14:44,166 --> 00:14:46,875
HUH?  OH.

265
00:14:46,958 --> 00:14:49,791
- OH, NOW THAT'S
A SMILE.

266
00:14:49,875 --> 00:14:52,625
- IT'S ABSOLUTELY
DAZZLING.

267
00:14:52,708 --> 00:14:54,333
- COME ON!

268
00:14:54,416 --> 00:14:56,791
WE DON'T HAVE TIME
FOR THIS BUNK.

269
00:14:59,375 --> 00:15:01,458
HEY, NITWITS,

270
00:15:01,541 --> 00:15:03,458
HOW'S THIS STORY GONNA
STAY INTERESTING

271
00:15:03,541 --> 00:15:05,958
IF WE CAN'T EVEN GET
THE SECOND ACT UP AND RUNNING?

272
00:15:06,041 --> 00:15:08,333
I'M GONNA TAKE CHARGE
AND PULL YOU SLOWS

273
00:15:08,416 --> 00:15:10,500
RIGHT INTO
THE THIRD ACT.

274
00:15:10,583 --> 00:15:12,500
- ( exclaiming )

275
00:15:14,791 --> 00:15:16,500
- HUH?
- WHAT'S THAT?

276
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:18,666
- ( clock ticking )

277
00:15:19,791 --> 00:15:21,708
- WELCOME ALL

278
00:15:21,791 --> 00:15:23,708
TO MY SPECIAL CORNER
OF THE EARTH--

279
00:15:23,791 --> 00:15:25,500
SMILE LAND.

280
00:15:25,583 --> 00:15:27,541
- MR. WILL B. GOOD.

281
00:15:27,625 --> 00:15:29,500
- HOLY COW,
IT'S OUR CREATOR.

282
00:15:29,583 --> 00:15:32,708
- THAT'S RIGHT.
MY NAME IS WILL B. GOOD.

283
00:15:32,791 --> 00:15:36,750
AND THIS IS THE MAGICAL WORLD
THAT I CREATED

284
00:15:36,833 --> 00:15:39,166
WHERE EVERYONE
COULD HAVE A SMILE.

285
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:42,125
YES, IT LOOKS EASY
TO MAKE A SMILE,

286
00:15:42,208 --> 00:15:44,916
BUT IT'S REALLY
A COMPLICATED JOB.

287
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,500
ANY TOM, DICK OR HARRY
CAN MAKE A SMILE LAST A SECOND.

288
00:15:48,583 --> 00:15:52,083
FOR ME, A SMILE
THAT LASTS A SECOND WON'T DO.

289
00:15:52,166 --> 00:15:55,291
I WANT A SMILE
THAT LASTS A LIFETIME.

290
00:15:55,375 --> 00:15:57,291
FOR EXAMPLE,
DID YOU KNOW

291
00:15:57,375 --> 00:15:59,666
THAT PEOPLE CAN ENJOY
BEING FRIGHTENED?

292
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:01,333
DID YOU KNOW
THAT SOMETIMES

293
00:16:01,416 --> 00:16:03,666
PEOPLE START CRYING
WHEN THEY'RE HAPPY?

294
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:06,166
IT'S SO TRICKY.
THAT'S WHY

295
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:08,541
IN ORDER TO CREATE
A PERFECT SMILE

296
00:16:08,625 --> 00:16:11,250
YOU NEED AN ENVIRONMENT
YOU CAN CONTROL.

297
00:16:11,333 --> 00:16:15,250
THAT'S WHY I CREATED
SMILE LAND--

298
00:16:15,333 --> 00:16:17,916
FOR THAT PURE,
SWEET SMILE

299
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,625
THAT MUST BE PROTECTED,
THAT WONDERFUL SMILE

300
00:16:20,708 --> 00:16:23,333
THAT SPREADS HAPPINESS
ALL ACROSS THE WORLD.

301
00:16:23,416 --> 00:16:24,958
I WANTED
TO MAKE A PLACE

302
00:16:25,041 --> 00:16:26,958
WHERE PEOPLE COULD FORGET
ABOUT REALITY,

303
00:16:27,041 --> 00:16:29,875
A PLACE WHERE THEY WOULDN'T FEEL
THE LEAST BIT FRIGHTENED

304
00:16:29,958 --> 00:16:31,833
UNTIL THE VERY END.

305
00:16:31,916 --> 00:16:35,583
YES, THE CITIZENS OF SMILE LAND
ENJOY THEMSELVES

306
00:16:35,666 --> 00:16:38,958
FROM THE MOMENT THEY'RE BORN
UNTIL THE DAY THEY DIE.

307
00:16:39,041 --> 00:16:41,583
AND WHEN THE END OF THE WORLD
INEVITABLY COMES,

308
00:16:41,666 --> 00:16:43,583
THEY WON'T KNOW
A THING.

309
00:16:43,666 --> 00:16:46,041
THEY'LL JUST BE
AS HAPPY AS EVER.

310
00:16:46,125 --> 00:16:49,083
ISN'T THAT AMAZING?

311
00:16:49,166 --> 00:16:51,500
- YEAH, IT'S AMAZING.
- GOOD.

312
00:16:51,583 --> 00:16:54,541
NOW, PINO, YOU WANTED TO SEE
VINCE AND RE-L AGAIN.

313
00:16:54,625 --> 00:16:57,375
ISN'T THAT RIGHT?
- YOU KNOW ABOUT THAT?

314
00:16:57,458 --> 00:17:00,083
- BUT OF COURSE.
I KNOW ABOUT EVERYTHING.

315
00:17:00,166 --> 00:17:02,583
I AM THE CREATOR,
AFTER ALL.

316
00:17:02,666 --> 00:17:06,916
I WAS HOPING YOU MIGHT TELL ME
SOMETHING IN EXCHANGE.

317
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,166
WHAT'S VINCENT'S--
NO, I MEAN,

318
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:11,875
WHAT'S ERGO PROXY'S
WEAKNESS?

319
00:17:11,958 --> 00:17:13,416
- WELL, THAT'S WEIRD.

320
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:16,375
I THOUGHT HE SAID
HE KNEW EVERYTHING.

321
00:17:16,458 --> 00:17:19,916
- COME ON, YOU CAN TELL ME.
IT'LL BE OUR LITTLE SECRET.

322
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,708
- I DON'T KNOW.

323
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:24,916
- I SEE.  SO YOU DON'T WANT
TO SEE THEM AGAIN?

324
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,500
- YES, I DO.
- THEN TELL ME

325
00:17:26,583 --> 00:17:28,500
WHAT I NEED
TO KNOW, OKAY?

326
00:17:28,583 --> 00:17:30,500
- I DON'T KNOW.
IT'S THE TRUTH.

327
00:17:30,583 --> 00:17:32,750
- ALL RIGHT,
SOMETHING ELSE THEN.

328
00:17:32,833 --> 00:17:35,166
DOES VINCENT KEEP
A SORT OF TREASURE PERHAPS?

329
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:37,000
I KNOW YOU CAN THINK
OF SOMETHING.

330
00:17:37,083 --> 00:17:39,000
PLEASE THINK
REAL HARD.

331
00:17:39,083 --> 00:17:41,041
BE A GOOD LITTLE GIRL,
ALL RIGHT?

332
00:17:41,125 --> 00:17:44,083
- DOES VINCE HAVE
A TREASURE?

333
00:17:51,291 --> 00:17:53,166
I DON'T KNOW.

334
00:17:57,916 --> 00:18:00,333
- YOU REALLY DON'T KNOW?
- I REALLY DON'T KNOW.

335
00:18:00,416 --> 00:18:03,041
- I SEE.
THAT'S TOO BAD.

336
00:18:03,125 --> 00:18:05,458
YOU SEE, YOUNG LADY,

337
00:18:05,541 --> 00:18:08,041
IF YOU DID HAVE VINCE'S
TREASURE, I COULD GRANT YOU

338
00:18:08,125 --> 00:18:11,958
ANYTHING YOU WANTED
IN THE WHOLE WIDE WORLD.

339
00:18:12,041 --> 00:18:14,000
- THAT'S A LIE.

340
00:18:14,083 --> 00:18:17,250
- OH, GOOD.
WELL, MISS,

341
00:18:17,333 --> 00:18:19,708
IF I'M A LIAR,
THEN WHAT'S BEHIND YOU?

342
00:18:20,916 --> 00:18:23,708
- WHO ARE YOU?
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN, WHO?

343
00:18:23,791 --> 00:18:26,708
IT'S US, SILLY.
- IT'S US-- AL AND PULL.

344
00:18:26,791 --> 00:18:28,708
MR. GOOD TURNED US
INTO CUSTOMERS.

345
00:18:28,791 --> 00:18:30,500
- HUH?

346
00:18:30,583 --> 00:18:32,958
- I HELPED MAKE
THEIR WISHES COME TRUE.

347
00:18:33,041 --> 00:18:34,958
UNDERSTAND?

348
00:18:35,041 --> 00:18:38,500
ALL I WANT IS TO MAKE YOUR WISH
COME TRUE NOW, PINO.

349
00:18:38,583 --> 00:18:41,375
TRUST ME.
PLEASE?

350
00:18:42,791 --> 00:18:45,791
I AM THE CREATOR
OF SMILE LAND.

351
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:48,583
YOU KNOW
YOU CAN TRUST ME.

352
00:18:48,666 --> 00:18:50,333
NOW...

353
00:18:53,541 --> 00:18:55,333
- Al: HEY, THERE'S
SOMETHING PHONY

354
00:18:55,416 --> 00:18:57,291
ABOUT THAT SMILE,
ISN'T THERE?

355
00:18:57,375 --> 00:18:59,625
- WHAT?

356
00:18:59,708 --> 00:19:03,000
- I MEAN, WHEN COMPARING.
PINO'S IS SO NATURAL.

357
00:19:03,083 --> 00:19:05,541
- YOURS SEEMS, I DON'T KNOW,
KIND OF FORCED.

358
00:19:05,625 --> 00:19:07,625
- LIKE IT WAS PAINTED ON
OR SOMETHING.

359
00:19:07,708 --> 00:19:10,041
- IT DOESN'T SEEM TO HAVE
MUCH SUBSTANCE.

360
00:19:10,125 --> 00:19:11,583
- Al: HE'S A FAKER.

361
00:19:11,666 --> 00:19:14,041
- Pull: IT'S NOT LIKE
PINO'S SMILE AT ALL.

362
00:19:14,125 --> 00:19:16,583
- HUH?

363
00:19:16,666 --> 00:19:19,375
SILENCE!
HOW DARE YOU?

364
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:21,208
YOU CAN'T
CRITICIZE ME.

365
00:19:21,291 --> 00:19:23,958
I CREATED ALL OF YOU CHARACTERS
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

366
00:19:24,041 --> 00:19:26,666
GUYS!

367
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:29,583
YOU DON'T GET TO DO ANYTHING
UNLESS I TELL YOU TO.

368
00:19:31,708 --> 00:19:35,041
AND I WON'T HAVE ANYONE ELSE
GOING OFF THE SCRIPT.

369
00:19:35,125 --> 00:19:38,291
ALL RIGHT, YOU WANT TO KNOW
THE REASON YOU EXIST?

370
00:19:38,375 --> 00:19:41,541
YOU DON'T HAVE
A REASON TO EXIST!

371
00:19:41,625 --> 00:19:44,250
YOU'RE NOTHING BUT SOME
REJECTED IDEAS.

372
00:19:44,333 --> 00:19:46,083
YOU'RE USELESS

373
00:19:46,166 --> 00:19:48,833
AND BARELY WORTH
THE PRICE OF YOUR SCRAP.

374
00:19:48,916 --> 00:19:52,083
- ( whirring sound )
- HMM?  WHAT'S THAT?

375
00:19:55,625 --> 00:19:57,500
( grunting )

376
00:20:10,708 --> 00:20:12,625
- THAT LOOKS LIKE FUN.

377
00:20:12,708 --> 00:20:15,416
- ( whimpering )
- ( birds chirping )

378
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:17,166
( sighs )

379
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:19,208
WAIT, PLEASE.

380
00:20:19,291 --> 00:20:21,458
THERE'S NO MORE
TIME LEFT.

381
00:20:21,541 --> 00:20:25,083
PLEASE, PINO,
YOU HAVE TO TELL VINCE AND RE-L

382
00:20:25,166 --> 00:20:27,333
NOT TO COME HERE
TO SMILE LAND.

383
00:20:27,416 --> 00:20:28,625
I BEG YOU.

384
00:20:28,708 --> 00:20:31,000
- HUH?
- LISTEN CLOSELY.

385
00:20:31,083 --> 00:20:34,250
VINCENT IS ON HIS WAY HERE
AS WE SPEAK.

386
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:36,500
WE'RE BOTH PROXIES.

387
00:20:36,583 --> 00:20:39,875
WHEN THE TWO OF US MEET,
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO FIGHT.

388
00:20:39,958 --> 00:20:41,375
- REALLY?

389
00:20:41,458 --> 00:20:43,625
- YES.
AND IF WE FIGHT,

390
00:20:43,708 --> 00:20:47,708
I WON'T BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN
THIS PLACE ANYMORE.

391
00:20:47,791 --> 00:20:50,666
- THAT MEANS
YOU'LL ALL DIE?

392
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:52,958
- YES.  THAT'S WHY

393
00:20:53,041 --> 00:20:55,791
I INVADED YOUR DREAMS
LIKE THIS

394
00:20:55,875 --> 00:20:58,541
AND TRIED TO GET YOU TO SHOW ME
VINCE'S WEAKNESS.

395
00:20:58,625 --> 00:21:00,333
I TRIED,
BUT IT DIDN'T WORK.

396
00:21:00,416 --> 00:21:02,333
- THIS IS A DREAM?

397
00:21:02,416 --> 00:21:04,333
YOU MEAN IT'S NOT REAL?

398
00:21:04,416 --> 00:21:07,500
- THIS IS A DREAM
AND NOT A DREAM.

399
00:21:07,583 --> 00:21:09,000
- YOU'RE FULL
OF BALONEY.

400
00:21:09,083 --> 00:21:11,500
- I THINK YOU'RE TRYING
TO TRICK PINO AGAIN.

401
00:21:11,583 --> 00:21:15,000
- NO, IT'S THE TRUTH.
PLEASE BELIEVE ME.

402
00:21:15,083 --> 00:21:17,958
EITHER WAY, THE WORLD
WILL SOON BE DESTROYED.

403
00:21:18,041 --> 00:21:19,958
IT'S ALL OUR FATE.

404
00:21:20,041 --> 00:21:23,666
UNTIL THEN,
LET ME HAVE MY WORLD.

405
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:27,000
LET ME BE HAPPY
WITH WHATEVER TIME I HAVE LEFT.

406
00:21:27,083 --> 00:21:30,250
I JUST DON'T WANT
TO FIGHT ANYMORE.

407
00:21:30,333 --> 00:21:33,916
- PINO, CAN YOU DO THIS
FOR US, PLEASE?

408
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,125
- YEAH, WE JUST WANT
TO SMILE TILL THE END.

409
00:21:37,208 --> 00:21:39,125
- THANKS TO YOU, PINO,

410
00:21:39,208 --> 00:21:41,833
WE CAN NOW SMILE
FROM THE HEART.

411
00:21:41,916 --> 00:21:44,041
- AMIGOS.

412
00:21:46,291 --> 00:21:48,708
- I CAN HEAR
THE PULSE OF THE AWAKENING.

413
00:21:48,791 --> 00:21:51,458
IT WON'T BE LONG NOW.

414
00:22:01,541 --> 00:22:03,416
- ( gasps )

415
00:22:04,541 --> 00:22:05,916
HUH?

416
00:22:18,125 --> 00:22:20,666
( gasps )
THEY'RE NOT HERE

417
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:22,208
OR THERE.

418
00:22:22,291 --> 00:22:24,458
WHAT DID I DO
WITH VINCE'S PENDANTS?

419
00:22:26,666 --> 00:22:27,750
VINCE.

420
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:32,541
- WHOA.
DONE CHARGING YOUR BATTERY?

421
00:22:32,625 --> 00:22:36,208
- HEY, VINCE, CAN YOU
COME DOWN HERE, PLEASE?

422
00:22:36,291 --> 00:22:38,750
- WHAT?

423
00:22:38,833 --> 00:22:40,250
- THERE THEY ARE.

424
00:22:40,333 --> 00:22:42,250
- WHAT'S GOING ON
WITH YOU?

425
00:22:42,333 --> 00:22:44,583
HEY, PINO,
LOOK OVER THERE.

426
00:22:44,666 --> 00:22:47,208
I THINK I CAN SEE SOME LIGHTS
ON THE HORIZON.

427
00:22:47,291 --> 00:22:49,458
MAYBE IT'S A TOWN.

428
00:22:49,541 --> 00:22:52,958
- IT'D BE GREAT
IF WE GOT TO RESUPPLY,

429
00:22:53,041 --> 00:22:55,083
BUT I'LL SETTLE
FOR A REST STOP.

430
00:22:55,166 --> 00:22:57,625
- A TOWN?
IT CAN'T BE.

431
00:23:09,791 --> 00:23:12,041
NO!  WE CAN'T STOP!

432
00:23:12,125 --> 00:23:14,458
- DO YOU HAVE A SHORT CIRCUIT?
- DON'T GO THERE!

433
00:23:14,541 --> 00:23:16,166
- Vincent: STOP BEING
SO DIFFICULT.

434
00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:18,125
- I HAVE TO SAVE
MY AMIGOS.

435
00:23:18,208 --> 00:23:19,916
- Re-L: AMIGOS?
- LISTEN TO ME.

436
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,791
IF YOU GO THERE,
SOMETHING BAD IS GONNA HAPPEN.

437
00:23:23,875 --> 00:23:25,791
I JUST KNOW--

438
00:23:25,875 --> 00:23:27,791
SOMETHING BAD.

439
00:23:27,875 --> 00:23:30,125
LEAVE IT ALONE.

440
00:23:30,208 --> 00:23:33,375
PLEASE, YOU GUYS,
JUST TRUST ME.

441
00:23:48,541 --> 00:23:50,291
- OH, ALL RIGHT.

442
00:23:51,416 --> 00:23:53,666
- Pino: VINCE.
- Re-L: VINCENT.

443
00:24:10,041 --> 00:24:11,958
- Will B. Good: AND SO

444
00:24:12,041 --> 00:24:15,000
THAT'S THE STORY
OF HOW SMILE LAND WAS SAVED

445
00:24:15,083 --> 00:24:17,750
BY ONE LITTLE GIRL.

446
