1
00:00:33,666 --> 00:00:37,250
- WHY DO YOU ALLOW HER
TO ACT WITH SUCH INDEPENDENCE?

2
00:00:37,333 --> 00:00:39,791
- IF SHE IS MORE THAN
YOU CAN DEAL WITH,

3
00:00:39,875 --> 00:00:43,750
THEN WHAT USE ARE YOU?
- SHE IS YOUR RAISON D'ETRE.

4
00:00:43,833 --> 00:00:46,416
LOSE HER AND YOU
WILL LOSE YOUR MEANING.

5
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:49,166
- SUCH IS THE BOND
BETWEEN AN ENTOURAGE

6
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:50,750
AND ITS MASTER.

7
00:00:50,833 --> 00:00:53,833
- ( cell phone rings )

8
00:00:53,916 --> 00:00:56,708
- Re-l: Iggy, I need to head
over to the HJ District.

9
00:00:56,791 --> 00:00:58,208
Come pick me up.

10
00:00:58,291 --> 00:01:00,791
- BUT HJ DISTRICT IS OUTSIDE
OUR JURISDICTION.

11
00:01:00,875 --> 00:01:02,458
- I REALLY DON'T CARE
ABOUT JURISDICTION.

12
00:01:02,541 --> 00:01:04,458
I'M GOING ONE WAY
OR THE OTHER.

13
00:01:04,541 --> 00:01:06,291
IF YOU'RE AFRAID
OF WHAT GRANDFATHER WILL SAY,

14
00:01:06,375 --> 00:01:07,833
I'M FINE GOING ALONE.

15
00:01:07,916 --> 00:01:11,916
- Man: WHY DO YOU ALLOW HER
TO ACT WITH SUCH INDEPENDENCE?

16
00:01:14,041 --> 00:01:15,916
- Woman: IF SHE IS MORE THAN
YOU CAN DEAL WITH,

17
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,375
THEN WHAT USE ARE YOU?

18
00:01:18,458 --> 00:01:20,125
- YOU'LL NEVER KNOW.

19
00:01:25,083 --> 00:01:28,500
- Woman:
SHE IS YOUR RAISON D'ETRE.

20
00:01:29,708 --> 00:01:33,291
LOSE HER AND YOU
WILL LOSE YOUR MEANING.

21
00:01:33,375 --> 00:01:35,666
- Man: SUCH IS THE BOND
BETWEEN AN ENTOURAGE

22
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:45,708
AND ITS MASTER.

23
00:01:45,791 --> 00:01:53,916

- ARE YOU SURE THE SHIP WILL
BE ABLE TO TAKE OFF

38
00:03:31,458 --> 00:03:33,375
WITH ALL THIS WIND?

39
00:03:33,458 --> 00:03:35,166
I MEAN, LOOK AT THE STATE
OF THIS THING.

40
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:36,750
IT'S READY TO FALL APART.

41
00:03:38,875 --> 00:03:42,125
HEY, YOU, MY LEG
IS REALLY STARTING TO HURT.

42
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:45,166
GIVE ME A MEDICAL EXAM.
- MEDICAL WHAT?

43
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:48,916
- YEAH.
SHE'S JUST A COMPANION MODEL.

44
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,291
SHE DOESN'T DO THAT.

45
00:03:50,375 --> 00:03:52,958
- ( sighs )
SURE, A USELESS SHIP.

46
00:03:53,041 --> 00:03:55,208
WHY NOT A USELESS AUTOREIV?

47
00:03:55,291 --> 00:03:58,000
I'M AMAZED YOU'VE MANAGED TO
MAKE IT THIS FAR IN ONE PIECE.

48
00:04:00,208 --> 00:04:03,291
OH.  IT MUST BE
BECAUSE YOU'RE A PROXY.

49
00:04:03,375 --> 00:04:05,291
- RE-L.

50
00:04:05,375 --> 00:04:07,583
- A PROXY WHO DOESN'T KNOW
HE'S A PROXY

51
00:04:07,666 --> 00:04:10,500
OR EVEN WHAT A PROXY IS.
IT'S PATHETIC.

52
00:04:12,625 --> 00:04:15,250
SHIT!
WHEN'S IT GOING TO LET UP?

53
00:04:45,333 --> 00:04:46,833
- Iggy: PROXY.

54
00:04:46,916 --> 00:04:49,541
IF IT HADN'T BEEN FOR HIM.

55
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:53,750
VINCENT LAW.

56
00:04:53,833 --> 00:04:56,250
- ( loud bang )

57
00:04:59,375 --> 00:05:01,541
- I KNOW THAT AUTOREIV.

58
00:05:07,125 --> 00:05:08,583
DID IT COME FOR THE BODY?

59
00:05:14,208 --> 00:05:17,291
- ( loud bang )
- WHAT?!

60
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:28,083
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING?
HEY!

61
00:05:47,791 --> 00:05:49,958
GO ON, TAKE IT.

62
00:05:50,041 --> 00:05:52,458
IT'S NOTHING BUT TROUBLE.

63
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:17,458
WAIT.

64
00:06:17,541 --> 00:06:19,916
WAS THAT YOUR MASTER?

65
00:06:39,041 --> 00:06:41,708
YOU WERE LOOKING
AFTER THAT PROXY.

66
00:06:58,166 --> 00:07:00,041
THIS IS--

67
00:07:05,916 --> 00:07:07,458
THIS IS FAMILIAR.

68
00:07:11,958 --> 00:07:15,916
OF COURSE.
THE WHOLE PLACE IS--

69
00:07:27,041 --> 00:07:28,916
DID HE MAKE THIS?

70
00:07:31,541 --> 00:07:34,041
WHAT THE HELL
ARE THESE PROXIES?

71
00:07:35,791 --> 00:07:37,958
IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER.

72
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:40,958
I'VE GOT IMPORTANT THINGS
TO DO.

73
00:07:48,625 --> 00:07:51,541
NOW THAT YOUR MASTER IS GONE,

74
00:07:51,625 --> 00:07:53,541
WHAT WILL YOU DO?

75
00:07:57,583 --> 00:08:00,041
- Vincent: OH.

76
00:08:00,125 --> 00:08:02,458
- DID YOU REALLY THINK

77
00:08:02,541 --> 00:08:05,166
YOU COULD TRY TO TAKE MY GUN
FROM ME WHILE I WAS ASLEEP?

78
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:08,083
- I THOUGHT
THAT YOU LOOKED COLD.

79
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:25,083
- FIX MY HAIR.

80
00:08:25,166 --> 00:08:27,916
YOU AT LEAST KNOW HOW
TO DO THAT, DON'T YOU?

81
00:08:32,583 --> 00:08:33,958
WELL, ARE YOU DEAF?

82
00:08:34,041 --> 00:08:36,250
- NOT NOW.
I'M TRYING TO READ.

83
00:08:36,333 --> 00:08:38,000
- ( grumbles )

84
00:08:38,083 --> 00:08:41,000
WHAT IS YOUR PROBLEM?

85
00:08:42,166 --> 00:08:44,583
- FINE, YOU DO IT.
- HUH?

86
00:08:44,666 --> 00:08:47,416
- HELP FIX MY HAIR.

87
00:08:49,666 --> 00:08:51,875
- I DON'T--
- JUST DO IT.

88
00:08:51,958 --> 00:08:54,291
I JUST WISH
IGGY WERE STILL HERE.

89
00:08:54,375 --> 00:08:56,791
- NO MATTER WHO THEY ARE,

90
00:08:56,875 --> 00:08:59,333
THE MASTER IS THE MASTER.

91
00:08:59,416 --> 00:09:02,166
ENTOURAGES CAN'T LIVE
WITHOUT A MASTER.

92
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:05,791
IT SEEMS EVEN MORE TRUE FOR ME
NOW THAT I HAVE A SOUL.

93
00:09:05,875 --> 00:09:08,291
SO...

94
00:09:08,375 --> 00:09:11,833
I DON'T REALLY
HAVE A CHOICE.

95
00:09:11,916 --> 00:09:15,958
I HAVE TO KILL THE ONE
WHO TOOK MY MASTER AWAY.

96
00:09:17,416 --> 00:09:21,000
YES, THAT'S GOOD.
IF I KILL HIM,

97
00:09:21,083 --> 00:09:23,333
SHE'LL HAVE TO COME BACK.

98
00:09:23,416 --> 00:09:25,291
ISN'T THAT RIGHT, RE-L?

99
00:09:25,375 --> 00:09:29,125
YOU'LL BE A GOOD GIRL AND COME
HOME WITH ME, WON'T YOU?

100
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:37,541
- YOU KNOW, THAT'S NOT BAD.

101
00:09:37,625 --> 00:09:39,333
- REALLY?

102
00:09:40,916 --> 00:09:43,833
- I'LL HAVE YOU DO IT
FROM NOW ON.

103
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:46,791
- WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
- I'M WORRIED ABOUT THE SHIP.

104
00:09:46,875 --> 00:09:50,416
- I'M GONNA GO TAKE A LOOK.
- BUT THE STORM.

105
00:09:53,375 --> 00:09:57,000
- IF I KILL THE ONE WHO TOOK
HER, SHE'LL COME BACK.

106
00:10:09,708 --> 00:10:13,291
- I THINK THE WIND HAS LET UP
ENOUGH THAT WE CAN TAKE OFF.

107
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:16,208
- RE-L.

108
00:10:16,291 --> 00:10:19,208
- IGGY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

109
00:10:19,291 --> 00:10:22,750
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE
IN ROMDEAU.

110
00:10:22,833 --> 00:10:24,708
- I TOLD YOU, REMEMBER?

111
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:28,000
I WOULD NEVER
LEAVE YOU BEHIND.

112
00:10:28,083 --> 00:10:31,333
- COGITO.  YOU'RE INFECTED.

113
00:10:31,416 --> 00:10:35,208
- OH, MY.  DID YOU REALLY
NOT NOTICE TILL NOW?

114
00:10:35,291 --> 00:10:39,291
( laughs ) I WOULD HAVE EXPECTED
YOU TO BE SMARTER THAN THAT.

115
00:10:39,375 --> 00:10:43,041
NO, YOU JUST WEREN'T PAYING
ATTENTION TO ME ANYWAY.

116
00:10:43,125 --> 00:10:45,583
THAT HURTS, RE-L.

117
00:10:45,666 --> 00:10:47,458
TO THINK OF ALL THE TIME
WE'VE BEEN TOGETHER.

118
00:10:47,541 --> 00:10:50,375
- WHEN DID IT HAPPEN?
- BACK IN ROMDEAU

119
00:10:50,458 --> 00:10:54,333
WHEN THAT INFECTED AUTOREIV
ATTACKED ME.

120
00:10:54,416 --> 00:10:57,708
- NO, YOU TESTED NEGATIVE.
I SAW IT.

121
00:10:57,791 --> 00:11:01,916
- IT'S EASY TO CHEAT
IF YOU KNOW THE SYSTEM.

122
00:11:03,458 --> 00:11:05,208
- SO ALL THIS TIME.

123
00:11:05,291 --> 00:11:09,708
- YES, BUT I HAVEN'T
REALLY CHANGED.

124
00:11:12,541 --> 00:11:13,708
- IGGY.

125
00:11:15,291 --> 00:11:17,250
- YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE
I'VE EVER OBEYED,

126
00:11:17,333 --> 00:11:19,250
THE ONLY ONE
I'VE PROTECTED.

127
00:11:19,333 --> 00:11:21,083
JUST YOU,

128
00:11:21,166 --> 00:11:24,458
JUST RE-L MAYER.

129
00:11:26,125 --> 00:11:28,166
BUT STILL, YOU INSIST

130
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:31,583
ON PRETENDING THAT
YOU DON'T NEED ME.

131
00:11:31,666 --> 00:11:32,750
- ( grunts )

132
00:12:08,666 --> 00:12:11,500
- WE'RE OUT OF WOOD.

133
00:12:11,583 --> 00:12:15,125
HEY, PINO.
- NOT NOW.  I'M TRYING TO READ.

134
00:12:15,208 --> 00:12:19,500
- COME ON, COULD YOU TRY
AND HELP OUT JUST A LITTLE?

135
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:21,500
- ( groans )

136
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:33,041
- LET ME OUT!

137
00:12:34,916 --> 00:12:37,500
- FINALLY AWAKE,
ARE WE?

138
00:12:39,041 --> 00:12:41,583
YOU'VE ALWAYS EXPECTED ME
TO FOLLOW YOUR EVERY WHIM,

139
00:12:41,666 --> 00:12:43,416
HAVEN'T YOU, RE-L?

140
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:46,166
NOW WE'RE GOING TO TRY THINGS
MY WAY FOR A CHANGE.

141
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:49,375
- WHO THE HELL ARE YOU?

142
00:12:49,458 --> 00:12:51,125
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

143
00:12:51,208 --> 00:12:53,833
I'M YOUR ENTOURAGE IGGY.

144
00:12:57,416 --> 00:13:00,208
- NO, IF YOU'RE IGGY,

145
00:13:00,291 --> 00:13:03,541
THEN IGGY IS DEAD.
- WHAT?

146
00:13:03,625 --> 00:13:05,666
- IGGY WOULD NEVER
TALK TO ME LIKE THAT.

147
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:08,416
- DON'T BE STUPID.
MY VOCAL PATTERNS ARE

148
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:11,041
JUST AN EFFECT
OF YOUR CUSTOMIZATIONS TO ME.

149
00:13:11,125 --> 00:13:13,333
- IT'S MORE THAN THAT.
ALL OF THIS.

150
00:13:13,416 --> 00:13:16,333
THE REAL IGGY WOULD NEVER
THINK OF DOING IT.

151
00:13:17,916 --> 00:13:20,333
IF THIS IS HOW THE COGITO VIRUS
CHANGED YOU,

152
00:13:20,416 --> 00:13:21,958
THEN YOU MIGHT AS WELL
BE DEAD.

153
00:13:22,041 --> 00:13:25,375
THE REAL IGGY WAS INFECTED
WITH THE VIRUS AND HE DIED.

154
00:13:25,458 --> 00:13:27,875
- SHUT UP!

155
00:13:31,333 --> 00:13:34,666
YOU ALWAYS WERE
A SELFISH BITCH, RE-L.

156
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:37,041
THIS IS NOT HOW IT WORKS
ANYMORE.

157
00:13:37,125 --> 00:13:39,041
YOU DON'T GET
TO WRITE ME OFF JUST

158
00:13:39,125 --> 00:13:41,041
BECAUSE I'VE GOTTEN COMPLICATED.

159
00:13:41,125 --> 00:13:45,791
IF I'M DEAD, THEN TELL ME
WHO'S BEEN BY YOUR SIDE

160
00:13:45,875 --> 00:13:47,875
EVER SINCE YOU LEFT ROMDEAU?

161
00:13:47,958 --> 00:13:49,875
- THAT WAS--

162
00:13:49,958 --> 00:13:52,250
- YOU'RE JUST AWFUL,
AREN'T YOU?

163
00:13:52,333 --> 00:13:55,375
YOU'RE SAYING THAT WASN'T ME?

164
00:13:55,458 --> 00:13:58,041
I WANT YOU TO TELL ME, RE-L,

165
00:13:58,125 --> 00:14:01,333
WHAT AM I?
I'M YOUR FAVORITE.

166
00:14:01,416 --> 00:14:03,416
YOU CUSTOMIZED ME
TO TALK THIS WAY.

167
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:04,708
- BASTARD.

168
00:14:04,791 --> 00:14:07,166
- OH, MY, WHAT A FACE
YOU'RE MAKING.

169
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:10,083
YOU KNOW YOU SHOULDN'T DO THAT.
YOU'LL GET WRINKLES.

170
00:14:10,166 --> 00:14:13,458
- YOU'RE A LIAR.  YOU'VE BEEN
LYING SINCE WE LEFT ROMDEAU.

171
00:14:13,541 --> 00:14:14,875
- LYING?

172
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:16,541
- IT'S TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE
FOR AN ENTOURAGE

173
00:14:16,625 --> 00:14:18,291
TO LIE TO ITS MASTER.

174
00:14:18,375 --> 00:14:21,208
THE LOYAL ENTOURAGE WOULD NEVER
BEHAVE THE WAY YOU'RE BEHAVING.

175
00:14:21,291 --> 00:14:24,250
YOU LIED TO ME,
TO YOUR MASTER.

176
00:14:24,333 --> 00:14:26,916
IGGY WOULD NEVER DO THAT.
IGGY IS DEAD.

177
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,791
- YOU'VE GOT TO BE KIDDING.

178
00:14:28,875 --> 00:14:31,333
WHO THE HELL DO YOU THINK'S
RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL THIS?

179
00:14:31,416 --> 00:14:34,000
SELFISH RE-L.
USELESS RE-L.

180
00:14:34,083 --> 00:14:35,708
INCOMPLETE RE-L.

181
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:39,291
BESIDES ME, WHO COULD DEAL
WITH A WHINY BITCH LIKE YOU?

182
00:14:39,375 --> 00:14:40,833
- WHAT ARE YOU?

183
00:14:40,916 --> 00:14:43,666
- DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
HOW INCOMPETENT YOU ARE?

184
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:47,375
YOU PREEN AND POSE AS SOME
HOT-SHOT CAREER WOMAN

185
00:14:47,458 --> 00:14:49,541
ACROSS ROMDEAU.

186
00:14:49,625 --> 00:14:53,458
WHO REALLY MADE ALL
THAT POSSIBLE?

187
00:14:53,541 --> 00:14:57,333
WHO WAS THERE TO SUPPORT YOU,
YOU RECKLESS, ARROGANT BITCH?

188
00:14:57,416 --> 00:15:00,083
YOU SAY MY LIE WAS UNACCEPTABLE?

189
00:15:00,166 --> 00:15:02,958
IT'S YOUR LIE THAT'S
UNACCEPTABLE.

190
00:15:03,041 --> 00:15:06,833
SO STOP PRETENDING
YOU DON'T NEED ME.

191
00:15:06,916 --> 00:15:10,000
- WHAT ARE YOU PLANNING
TO DO TO ME?

192
00:15:10,083 --> 00:15:13,291
- ( laughs ) LITTLE LATE
TO START WORRYING ABOUT THAT.

193
00:15:13,375 --> 00:15:14,916
- TELL ME.

194
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:18,541
- WHAT I ALWAYS DO.

195
00:15:18,625 --> 00:15:20,333
I'M GOING TO PROTECT YOU.
- ( gasps )

196
00:15:23,333 --> 00:15:26,333
- RE-L, YOU SAID THAT
AN AUTOREIV LIKE ME

197
00:15:26,416 --> 00:15:31,291
COULD NEVER TRULY UNDERSTAND YOU
BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE A SOUL.

198
00:15:31,375 --> 00:15:34,708
BUT I DO HAVE A SOUL.

199
00:15:34,791 --> 00:15:37,250
HOW DID YOU NOT NOTICE?

200
00:15:39,416 --> 00:15:42,833
WE CAN'T MAKE IT BACK
TO ROMDEAU IN THE U-4 ANYMORE.

201
00:15:42,916 --> 00:15:44,500
BUT THERE'S STILL THE SHIP.

202
00:15:44,583 --> 00:15:47,083
THAT WAS YOUR IDEA,
WASN'T IT?

203
00:15:47,166 --> 00:15:51,500
- AND WHAT HAPPENS AFTER
YOU STEAL THE SHIP?

204
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:54,083
EVEN IF WE MAKE IT BACK,
YOU'RE STILL INFECTED.

205
00:15:54,166 --> 00:15:56,750
THEY'LL HAVE YOU DESTROYED.

206
00:16:21,625 --> 00:16:23,291
- ( gasps )

207
00:16:26,875 --> 00:16:29,750
- VINCE!
- PINO.

208
00:16:29,833 --> 00:16:33,208
- LOOK, I'M HELPING
BECAUSE I'M GOOD.  SEE?

209
00:16:33,291 --> 00:16:36,833
- VERY NICE.
NOW FIND THESE.

210
00:16:36,916 --> 00:16:39,791
- ROGER!

211
00:16:39,875 --> 00:16:42,833
HEY, VINCE, LIKE THIS?

212
00:16:42,916 --> 00:16:44,250
- YEAH.

213
00:16:45,708 --> 00:16:47,791
- THIS ONE?
- YEP.

214
00:16:47,875 --> 00:16:49,750
- ( humming )

215
00:16:57,083 --> 00:16:59,916
- ( gasps ) IT'S YOU.

216
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,583
- I'M NOT GOING TO HURT YOU.

217
00:17:03,166 --> 00:17:04,708
- PINO, THAT'S ENOUGH.

218
00:17:06,666 --> 00:17:09,583
I KNOW YOU.
YOU'RE RE-L'S--

219
00:17:15,166 --> 00:17:18,583
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
WITH HER GUN?

220
00:17:20,666 --> 00:17:22,375
WHERE'S RE-L?

221
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:25,958
- RE-L'S GOING TO
KILL YOU SOMEDAY.

222
00:17:26,041 --> 00:17:29,583
SO WHY DO YOU NEED HER?

223
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:39,000
- RE-L'S NOT SAFE WITH YOU.

224
00:17:40,583 --> 00:17:43,875
YOU'RE DESTINED
TO KILL HER.

225
00:17:43,958 --> 00:17:45,625
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

226
00:17:47,958 --> 00:17:51,625
- Iggy: I'VE SEEN IT.
A HIDEOUS MONSTER TORMENTING

227
00:17:51,708 --> 00:17:56,125
RE-L AS SHE LIES STRUGGLING
IN AGONY.

228
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:59,625
YOU ARE THE MONSTER,
VINCENT LAW.

229
00:17:59,708 --> 00:18:02,958
- THIS IS INSANE.
WHY WOULD I KILL RE-L?

230
00:18:08,041 --> 00:18:10,125
- THAT FACE.

231
00:18:10,208 --> 00:18:12,291
IT'S THE SAME WAY YOU LOOKED
WHEN RE-L PULLED

232
00:18:12,375 --> 00:18:14,291
THIS GUN ON YOU.

233
00:18:18,708 --> 00:18:22,125
YOUR FACE TELLS ME YOU WILL
INEVITABLY END UP KILLING RE-L.

234
00:18:22,208 --> 00:18:24,541
MY BELOVED RE-L.

235
00:18:38,916 --> 00:18:40,333
- ( gasps )

236
00:18:48,625 --> 00:18:50,333
- WHAT HAVE YOU DONE
WITH HER?

237
00:19:18,958 --> 00:19:20,916
- RE-L!

238
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:26,375
- IGGY.

239
00:19:35,666 --> 00:19:38,458
WELL DONE, VINCENT.

240
00:19:38,541 --> 00:19:40,916
NOW I CAN'T KILL YOU.

241
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,916
- RE-L.

242
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,541
- YOU BEAT ME.

243
00:19:45,625 --> 00:19:47,916
- RE-L, I WAS--

244
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,250
- ( beeping )

245
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,625
- ( beeping faster )

246
00:20:15,666 --> 00:20:17,583
- RE-L.

247
00:20:34,708 --> 00:20:38,000
I THINK IT SHOULD BE
ABLE TO FLY.

248
00:20:48,708 --> 00:20:50,500
- Iggy: RE-L,

249
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:52,750
LOOK WHAT
YOU'VE DONE TO ME, RE-L.

250
00:20:54,791 --> 00:20:57,125
YOU WEREN'T WORTH
WHAT I SACRIFICED.

251
00:20:58,666 --> 00:21:03,083
BUT YOUR DEATH WOULD HAVE
MADE MY LIFE MEANINGLESS.

252
00:21:05,375 --> 00:21:08,125
- WHY WERE YOU MY MASTER?

253
00:21:08,208 --> 00:21:10,625
WHY DID IT HAVE
TO BE YOU?

254
00:21:10,708 --> 00:21:13,541
- ( sobs )

255
00:21:13,625 --> 00:21:15,583
- RE-L.

256
00:21:16,791 --> 00:21:20,041
PLEASE, I WANT YOU TO--

257
00:21:20,125 --> 00:21:23,541
DON'T HATE ME, OKAY?

258
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:26,625
- IGGY.

259
00:21:26,708 --> 00:21:29,000
- IT WAS SO HARD.

260
00:21:29,083 --> 00:21:32,083
I WANTED TO BE WITH YOU
NO MATTER WHAT.

261
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:36,125
IT HURT.
YOU MADE IT HURT SO.

262
00:21:36,208 --> 00:21:39,041
WHY DID YOU HAVE TO BE
SUCH A USELESS BITCH?

263
00:21:39,125 --> 00:21:41,666
IT'S JUST--

264
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:45,166
PLEASE, DON'T HATE ME.

265
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:46,833
- OKAY.

266
00:21:46,916 --> 00:21:48,875
I PROMISE, IGGY.

267
00:21:48,958 --> 00:21:50,833
- RE-L.

268
00:21:50,916 --> 00:21:53,041
RE-L MAYER!

269
00:21:53,125 --> 00:21:54,875
RE-L.

270
00:21:54,958 --> 00:21:56,416
- IT'S OKAY.

271
00:22:02,375 --> 00:22:04,416
- ( playing tune )

272
00:22:06,041 --> 00:22:08,083
- ( loud bang )

273
00:22:21,791 --> 00:22:23,458
- I KNOW HOW YOU FEEL.

274
00:22:23,541 --> 00:22:26,458
YOU'RE FEELING SAD.

275
00:22:28,708 --> 00:22:30,458
- THE VIRUS.
- HUH?

276
00:22:30,541 --> 00:22:33,916
- I MEAN, DOES IT MAKE
YOU FEEL UNHAPPY

277
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,958
KNOWING WHAT SAD IS?

278
00:22:39,166 --> 00:22:42,458
- I THINK IT ACTUALLY
MAKES ME HAPPY.

279
00:22:42,541 --> 00:22:44,958
- WHY IS THAT?

280
00:22:45,041 --> 00:22:48,750
- I DON'T KNOW.
ALL DONE.

281
00:22:48,833 --> 00:22:51,666
I'M GONNA GO PUT SOME FLOWERS
ON THE OTHER GRAVE, TOO.

282
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:56,958
- IGGY.

283
00:22:57,041 --> 00:23:00,791
AFTER YOU WERE INFECTED
WITH THE COGITO VIRUS,

284
00:23:00,875 --> 00:23:02,541
YOU COULD HAVE LEFT ME.

285
00:23:02,625 --> 00:23:04,458
YOU COULD HAVE BEEN FREE.

286
00:23:04,541 --> 00:23:07,166
WHY DID YOU STAY?

287
00:23:10,375 --> 00:23:11,500
- RE-L.

288
00:23:11,583 --> 00:23:13,500
- ( crying )

289
00:23:18,583 --> 00:23:20,500
YEAH, WHAT?

290
00:23:24,708 --> 00:23:28,333
WHAT DO YOU WANT?
- WELL--

291
00:23:28,416 --> 00:23:31,458
- IF YOU DON'T NEED ANYTHING,
THEN JUST LEAVE ME ALONE.

292
00:23:32,541 --> 00:23:35,250
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

293
00:23:41,458 --> 00:23:43,291
BUT WHY?

294
00:23:43,375 --> 00:23:48,041
BECAUSE YOU SAID YOU WEREN'T
GOING TO SHOOT ME YET.

295
00:23:48,125 --> 00:23:51,916
SO I'M GIVING IT BACK TO YOU.

296
00:23:53,875 --> 00:23:57,583
WE SHOULD GET GOING, RE-L.

297
00:23:57,666 --> 00:24:01,125
- VINCENT, I--

298
00:24:05,125 --> 00:24:08,375
YEAH, SO THAT'S ALL
I CAME TO SAY.

299
00:24:15,625 --> 00:24:17,458
- IGGY,

300
00:24:17,541 --> 00:24:21,458
I STILL DON'T KNOW
WHO YOU REALLY WERE.

301
00:24:21,541 --> 00:24:23,458
BUT I PROMISE,

302
00:24:23,541 --> 00:24:26,041
I'LL UNDERSTAND SOMEDAY.

303
00:24:26,125 --> 00:24:28,916
I'M SORRY.

A PHRASE FROM AN OLD FAMILIAR
TALE BECKONS US

313
00:26:07,208 --> 00:26:08,916
TO THE FOUNTAIN OF ILLUSIONS.

314
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,625
THE FACE OF SOMEONE
WHO LOOKS LIKE YOU,

315
00:26:11,708 --> 00:26:14,958
REFLECTED ON THE SURFACE
OF A WAVERING MIRROR.
