1
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:41,916
- ( Vincent's voice )
THE UNCERTAIN LIGHT

2
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,583
REFLECTS THE PURPOSE
BEHIND MY JOURNEY...

3
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,791
BACK TO MY BIRTHPLACE.

4
00:00:57,291 --> 00:01:00,166
DOES THE THING
I'M TRAVELING TO MOSK TO FIND

5
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:02,500
ACTUALLY EXIST?

6
00:01:02,583 --> 00:01:05,458
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR.

7
00:01:19,875 --> 00:01:22,500
I RAN OUT OF FOOD
A LITTLE WHILE AGO.

8
00:01:24,208 --> 00:01:28,708
IT SEEMS THE ONLY THING
I FOUND ON THIS JOURNEY

9
00:01:28,791 --> 00:01:32,125
IS A LONELY DEATH.

10
00:01:32,208 --> 00:01:34,166
I'M ALL ALONE.

11
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:36,166
WELL, EXCEPT FOR--

12
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:38,166
- Rino: VINCE!

13
00:01:40,666 --> 00:01:42,791
THERE'S SOMETHING
SHINING OVER THERE.

14
00:01:45,791 --> 00:01:48,083
MAYBE IT'S
A PLAYING CARD SOLDIER.

15
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:53,583
- ( groans )
THOSE ARE JUST FROM A BOOK.

16
00:02:01,083 --> 00:02:03,333
- ( Vincent's voice )
I'M NOT EXACTLY ALONE.

17
00:02:03,416 --> 00:02:06,250
I HAVE SOMETHING
RESEMBLING A COMPANION--

18
00:02:06,333 --> 00:02:08,625
AN INFECTED AUTOREIV.

19
00:02:10,541 --> 00:02:13,666
- THERE'S A LIGHT.
- ( helicopter blades whirring )

20
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:15,666
- WHAT?

21
00:02:25,958 --> 00:02:28,541
- ( rock music playing )

22
00:02:41,625 --> 00:02:45,375
- ♪ YOU COMPLETE MY FATE ♪

23
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:51,625
♪ THE WORLD
UNWINDS INSIDE OF ME ♪

24
00:02:51,708 --> 00:02:55,708
♪ YOU COMPLETE MY FATE ♪

25
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,708
♪ THE HALO CRAWLS AWAY ♪

26
00:03:02,666 --> 00:03:07,833

27
00:03:07,916 --> 00:03:14,250
♪ YOU REFILL MY PLACE ♪

28
00:03:20,125 --> 00:03:25,416

♪ COME AND SAVE ME. ♪

33
00:04:26,541 --> 00:04:27,958
- A TOWER.

34
00:04:28,041 --> 00:04:29,958
MAYBE IF WE HIDE
IN THE SHADOWS,

35
00:04:30,041 --> 00:04:31,666
WE CAN AVOID
ANY MORE ATTACKS.

36
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:34,458
- FROM MY PRESENT LOCATION,
THAT'S 558 UNITS

37
00:04:34,541 --> 00:04:36,000
HEADING ALONG
THE X-AXIS

38
00:04:36,083 --> 00:04:38,250
AND 832 UNITS
ALONG THE Y-AXIS.

39
00:04:38,333 --> 00:04:41,333
- I COULD USE LESS TALKING
AND MORE HELPING OVER HERE.

40
00:04:41,416 --> 00:04:43,458
( grunting )

41
00:04:45,625 --> 00:04:47,458
- ( rapid gunfire )

42
00:04:56,041 --> 00:04:57,541
- AUTOREIVS?

43
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:08,583
PINO.

44
00:05:49,166 --> 00:05:50,958
- DON'T MOVE.

45
00:05:53,125 --> 00:05:54,458
- OKAY.

46
00:05:59,166 --> 00:06:01,125
- THE MOSQUITO'S DOWN.
KEEP SEARCHING.

47
00:06:24,875 --> 00:06:27,125
- HEY, DOES IT
TASTE GOOD?

48
00:06:27,208 --> 00:06:28,833
- SO IT'S THIS WAY:

49
00:06:28,916 --> 00:06:31,041
THE DOME CITY
YOU KEEP TALKING ABOUT--

50
00:06:31,125 --> 00:06:32,291
- IT'S CALLED ROMDEAU.

51
00:06:33,875 --> 00:06:35,791
- ARE YOU
THE CARD SOLDIERS?

52
00:06:35,875 --> 00:06:37,791
- ARE WE THE WHAT?

53
00:06:37,875 --> 00:06:40,875
- WE SAW THE SHINING LIGHT.
THAT'S WHY WE CAME.

54
00:06:40,958 --> 00:06:42,541
- SHINING LIGHT?

55
00:06:42,625 --> 00:06:45,125
THAT'S THE SAME THING
THAT WOMAN WAS SAYING.

56
00:06:45,208 --> 00:06:47,291
- THERE ARE STORIES
ABOUT A MONSTER

57
00:06:47,375 --> 00:06:49,291
THAT SLEEPS UNDERGROUND
OUT HERE.

58
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:51,541
- THAT'S NOTHING
BUT SUPERSTITION.

59
00:06:51,625 --> 00:06:53,083
IT'S NOT RELEVANT.

60
00:06:53,166 --> 00:06:56,500
- OH.  CAN I ASK A QUESTION
ABOUT SOMETHING?

61
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:58,666
WHY ARE YOU FIGHTING
THE AUTOREIVS?

62
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:01,958
- WHY ARE WE FIGHTING?
ONCE YOU'RE ON THE BATTLEFIELD,

63
00:07:02,041 --> 00:07:04,333
IT'S BEST TO STOP ASKING
THOSE QUESTIONS.

64
00:07:05,416 --> 00:07:07,125
- I DON'T GET IT.

65
00:07:07,208 --> 00:07:09,625
- MM.
- IS IT TRUE THAT ONCE THEY'RE

66
00:07:09,708 --> 00:07:11,625
INFECTED WITH THAT VIRUS,
WHATEVER IT IS,

67
00:07:11,708 --> 00:07:14,666
THAT THEY GET A SOUL?
- I'M VERY SORRY,

68
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:16,458
I CAN'T ANSWER THAT.

69
00:07:16,541 --> 00:07:18,000
- BUT, VINCE, I--

70
00:07:18,083 --> 00:07:20,083
- WE'RE JUST TRAVELERS
PASSING THROUGH.

71
00:07:20,166 --> 00:07:22,875
THANK YOU, EVERYBODY,
FOR YOUR HOSPITALITY,

72
00:07:22,958 --> 00:07:24,875
ESPECIALLY THE FOOD.

73
00:07:26,416 --> 00:07:29,208
- AND YOU CERTAINLY
DID EAT.

74
00:07:29,291 --> 00:07:30,875
YOU'RE WELCOME, SIR.

75
00:07:32,708 --> 00:07:35,833
- CALL ME VINCENT.
MY NAME IS VINCENT LAW.

76
00:07:35,916 --> 00:07:38,083
- I'M LIEUTENANT OMAKATL.

77
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:40,333
AND THIS IS
COMMANDER PATEKATL.

78
00:07:40,416 --> 00:07:43,000
UM, MAY I ASK YOU SOMETHING
ABOUT YOUR SAILBOAT?

79
00:07:43,083 --> 00:07:45,708
- MY SHIP IS CALLED
THE SENSAN.

80
00:07:45,791 --> 00:07:48,166
- WHAT'S ITS POWER SOURCE?
I'D ALSO LIKE TO KNOW

81
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:50,208
ITS AVERAGE CRUISING SPEED
AND RANGE.

82
00:07:50,291 --> 00:07:52,250
- I'M AFRAID
I DON'T KNOW THAT.

83
00:07:53,958 --> 00:07:56,208
- DON'T LOOK AT ME.
I DON'T KNOW.

84
00:07:56,291 --> 00:07:57,666
- DON'T WORRY.

85
00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:00,375
OUR PEOPLE ARE ALREADY
SEEING TO ITS RETRIEVAL.

86
00:08:00,458 --> 00:08:02,833
YOU CAN LEAVE
THE REPAIRS TO US.

87
00:08:04,291 --> 00:08:06,083
- I DON'T KNOW
HOW TO THANK YOU.

88
00:08:08,875 --> 00:08:10,791
- YOU CAN THANK US
BY HELPING US--

89
00:08:10,875 --> 00:08:12,791
HELPING US WIN
OUR BATTLE.

90
00:08:12,875 --> 00:08:14,541
- WELL, I--

91
00:08:14,625 --> 00:08:17,291
- Man: NO SIGN OF THE ENEMY
NEAR CHAROS.

92
00:08:17,375 --> 00:08:20,791
- HMM.  CASUALTY REPORT.

93
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:22,791
- Man: WE HAVE NINE
CONFIRMED DEATHS

94
00:08:22,875 --> 00:08:25,125
FROM PLATOONS ALPHA,
BETA AND GAMMA.

95
00:08:25,208 --> 00:08:28,875
ALL TOLD, OUR BATTALIONS
CURRENTLY STAND AT 43 SOLDIERS.

96
00:08:28,958 --> 00:08:30,916
SHALL I UP PRODUCTION?

97
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,750
- LET'S NOT OVEREXTEND OURSELVES
FOR THE LONG GAME.

98
00:08:33,833 --> 00:08:36,083
WE'LL STAY CONSERVATIVE.
NO INCREASE.

99
00:08:36,166 --> 00:08:37,500
- YES, SIR.

100
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:40,083
- EVERYONE, MAY I HAVE
YOUR ATTENTION, PLEASE?

101
00:08:40,166 --> 00:08:41,750
( over speaker )
First off,

102
00:08:41,833 --> 00:08:43,750
I have some unfortunate news
to report.

103
00:08:43,833 --> 00:08:47,333
We lost nine of our brave
soldiers in this last battle.

104
00:08:47,416 --> 00:08:49,333
However, this is not
the time for grief.

105
00:08:49,416 --> 00:08:52,333
We must remember our enemy
has a singular goal--

106
00:08:52,416 --> 00:08:54,375
they wish to overrun
the production room

107
00:08:54,458 --> 00:08:58,375
and the heart of our fortress--
the very body of our parents.

108
00:08:58,458 --> 00:09:00,541
- EVEN IF THEY ATTACK US
IN GREAT NUMBERS,

109
00:09:00,625 --> 00:09:02,541
SO LONG AS THEY HAVE
THIS SINGLE OBJECTIVE,

110
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:04,833
WE CAN ALWAYS ANTICIPATE
THEIR ATTACK.

111
00:09:04,916 --> 00:09:07,250
- AS SOON AS THE AIRSHIP
IS REPAIRED,

112
00:09:07,333 --> 00:09:09,625
YOU MAY COMMENCE
ITS ARMORED RETROFITTING.

113
00:09:09,708 --> 00:09:10,791
- HUH?

114
00:09:10,875 --> 00:09:12,833
- THERE'S NO NEED
TO HOLD BACK IN WAR.

115
00:09:12,916 --> 00:09:15,625
FOR EXAMPLE, YOUR SHIP'S
MOBILITY AND FUEL EFFICIENCY

116
00:09:15,708 --> 00:09:18,375
WILL COME IN PLENTY HANDY
ON THE BATTLEFIELD.

117
00:09:18,458 --> 00:09:21,125
- OH.

118
00:09:21,208 --> 00:09:22,625
- I KNOW,

119
00:09:22,708 --> 00:09:24,625
BUT HUMANS MUST WIN
THIS WAR.

120
00:09:24,708 --> 00:09:27,291
I ASSUME, AS A HUMAN,
THAT YOU UNDERSTAND,

121
00:09:27,375 --> 00:09:28,833
MR. LAW.

122
00:09:31,208 --> 00:09:32,625
- ( Vincent's voice )
GREAT.

123
00:09:32,708 --> 00:09:35,083
I THINK
I'M IN SERIOUS TROUBLE.

124
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:39,375
- ( groaning )

125
00:09:39,458 --> 00:09:40,875
- HMM?

126
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:42,375
( groaning )

127
00:09:42,458 --> 00:09:45,875
- SORRY.
WHERE'S THE BATHROOM?

128
00:09:45,958 --> 00:09:47,875
- HMM.

129
00:09:47,958 --> 00:09:49,833
MM.
- SORRY.

130
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,375
- THIS IS BETA FOUR,
REQUESTING PERMISSION TO LAND.

131
00:10:05,541 --> 00:10:07,958
- ( toilet flushes )

132
00:10:12,625 --> 00:10:14,541
- THIS IS PATHETIC.

133
00:10:14,625 --> 00:10:16,541
- VINCE?

134
00:10:16,625 --> 00:10:18,625
- I THINK I ATE TOO MUCH
TOO QUICKLY

135
00:10:18,708 --> 00:10:21,333
AND MY STOMACH
COULDN'T QUITE HANDLE IT.

136
00:10:21,416 --> 00:10:23,666
BUT I'M ALL BETTER NOW.

137
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:26,166
- ALL BETTER.

138
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:28,833
- ( Vincent's voice )
FOR SOME REASON, NOW I FEEL

139
00:10:28,916 --> 00:10:32,375
CLOSER TO THIS INFECTED AUTOREIV
THAN I DO TO THESE PEOPLE.

140
00:10:33,916 --> 00:10:35,875
IT DIDN'T FEEL
LIKE TWO OF US

141
00:10:35,958 --> 00:10:38,500
TRAVELING TOGETHER
AT THE TIME.

142
00:10:38,583 --> 00:10:43,208
ALL I WANTED WAS TO SEE
ANOTHER HUMAN BEING.

143
00:10:43,291 --> 00:10:44,958
- SOMETHING'S WEIRD.

144
00:10:45,041 --> 00:10:47,333
- HUH?
- THE PEOPLE HERE--

145
00:10:47,416 --> 00:10:48,833
THEY'RE ALL WEIRD.

146
00:10:48,916 --> 00:10:51,083
- YEAH.

147
00:10:51,166 --> 00:10:53,416
ONCE THEY FINISH
REPAIRING THE SHIP,

148
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:55,666
WE SHOULD LOOK
FOR A WAY TO ESCAPE.

149
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:57,666
- ( Vincent's voice )
I'D FINALLY MANAGED

150
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:59,541
TO REACH CHAROS,

151
00:10:59,625 --> 00:11:02,041
BUT I DIDN'T
BELONG HERE EITHER.

152
00:11:05,291 --> 00:11:06,375
- PINO?

153
00:11:06,458 --> 00:11:08,250
WHERE'D YOU GO?

154
00:11:11,666 --> 00:11:14,208
- THERE WAS
SOMETHING SHINY.

155
00:11:14,291 --> 00:11:16,875
- AGAIN?
ARE YOU SURE?

156
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:19,458
- YES.
IT WAS TWINKLING.

157
00:11:19,541 --> 00:11:21,458
- COME ON.

158
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:26,125
- I'M COMING.

159
00:11:32,208 --> 00:11:34,125
- IT'S AN AIRSHIP,

160
00:11:34,208 --> 00:11:37,083
ALTHOUGH I'VE NEVER SEEN
ONE LIKE THAT BEFORE.

161
00:11:37,166 --> 00:11:41,000
- YEAH, IT'LL BE NICE NOT HAVING
TO WORRY ABOUT A POWER SOURCE.

162
00:11:41,083 --> 00:11:42,416
( grunts )

163
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,750
- WELL, CONSIDERING
THE MOSQUITO'S FLIGHT RANGE,

164
00:11:44,833 --> 00:11:46,750
WE COULD SURE USE
THIS THING.

165
00:11:46,833 --> 00:11:48,958
HMM?

166
00:11:51,166 --> 00:11:53,041
HEY.

167
00:12:24,833 --> 00:12:26,750
- I HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING.

168
00:12:26,833 --> 00:12:28,750
CAN'T YOU JUST TELL ME
WHAT'S GOING ON?

169
00:12:28,833 --> 00:12:31,875
JUST TELL ME--
- WHO ELSE IS WITH YOU?

170
00:12:31,958 --> 00:12:33,625
ASURANS DON'T KILL
LIKE THIS.

171
00:12:33,708 --> 00:12:36,625
THIS WAS PERSONAL
AND MESSY,

172
00:12:36,708 --> 00:12:38,166
LIKE IT WAS FUN.

173
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:41,166
OUR MEN WERE TORN APART,
AND SOMEONE ENJOYED IT.

174
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:43,583
- NO.
WHY WOULD I?

175
00:12:43,666 --> 00:12:47,000
- WELL, IN THAT CASE,
HOW ABOUT THE AUTOREIV?

176
00:12:47,083 --> 00:12:50,000
- THAT'S RIDICULOUS.
- BE THAT AS IT MAY,

177
00:12:50,083 --> 00:12:52,333
THERE'S ONE THING
THAT'S FOR CERTAIN:

178
00:12:52,416 --> 00:12:54,875
NONE OF THIS STARTED
UNTIL AFTER YOU TWO CAME.

179
00:12:58,333 --> 00:13:00,375
- WAIT.
IT WASN'T ME.

180
00:13:03,166 --> 00:13:05,041
- ( Vincent's voice )
NOT AGAIN.

181
00:13:08,375 --> 00:13:10,708
- ( person breathing heavily )

182
00:13:15,083 --> 00:13:17,375
- ( woman yelping )

183
00:13:23,708 --> 00:13:25,708
- ( Vincent's voice )
AM I THE ANGEL OF DEATH?

184
00:13:30,625 --> 00:13:34,083
EVERYTHING I TOUCH
STAINS WITH BLOOD.

185
00:13:38,625 --> 00:13:40,958
EVERYONE AROUND ME DIES.

186
00:13:48,625 --> 00:13:50,500
RE-L.

187
00:13:52,625 --> 00:13:55,375
- ( metal clanging )
- ( woman mumbling )

188
00:14:06,416 --> 00:14:09,291
- SO WHAT DO YOU THINK
ABOUT THOSE TWO?

189
00:14:09,375 --> 00:14:11,083
- THAT STUFF
ABOUT THE LIGHT.

190
00:14:11,166 --> 00:14:13,500
- THE WOMAN MENTIONED
THE SAME SORT OF THING.

191
00:14:13,583 --> 00:14:15,791
- YOU MEAN THE STORIES
ABOUT LIGHT

192
00:14:15,875 --> 00:14:18,166
RADIATING FROM
AN UNSEEN MOON?

193
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:20,458
ANYONE STUPID ENOUGH
TO LISTEN TO SUCH NON--

194
00:14:20,541 --> 00:14:23,500
- REGARDLESS, LET'S LOOK
TO HAVE NO FURTHER INCIDENTS.

195
00:14:23,583 --> 00:14:26,541
- COMMANDER, THE ASURAN ARMY.
- HUH?

196
00:14:36,875 --> 00:14:39,250
- BIT BY BIT
IT CAN'T BE SEEN.

197
00:14:39,333 --> 00:14:41,625
BIT BY BIT IT CAN'T
BE HEARD.

198
00:14:41,708 --> 00:14:44,583
BIT BY BIT
IT GROWS STRONGER,

199
00:14:44,666 --> 00:14:47,791
HERE, THERE, EVERYWHERE.

200
00:14:49,208 --> 00:14:52,833
THE LAST BEAT.
THE MASTER COMES.

201
00:14:52,916 --> 00:14:55,000
RIDING ACROSS
THE MOONLIGHT,

202
00:14:55,083 --> 00:14:58,000
IT HAUNTS THE SHADOWS
IN THE DARK PLACES.

203
00:14:59,458 --> 00:15:03,541
HE TAKES HIS TIME,

204
00:15:03,625 --> 00:15:08,291
BIT BY BIT,
BIT BY BIT, BIT BY BIT.

205
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:10,125
- Woman and Rino:
BIT BY BIT.

206
00:15:10,208 --> 00:15:13,041
- BIT BY BIT,
BIT BY BIT.

207
00:15:13,125 --> 00:15:17,291
- Together: BIT BY BIT,
BIT BY BIT.

208
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:20,625
BIT BY BIT, BIT BY BIT.
- ( Vincent's voice ) MAYBE--

209
00:15:20,708 --> 00:15:23,791
- BIT BY BIT, BIT BY BIT.
- I DON'T EVEN KNOW.

210
00:15:23,875 --> 00:15:26,833
- BIT BY BIT, BIT BY BIT.
- MAYBE INSIDE OF ME--

211
00:15:26,916 --> 00:15:28,833
- BIT BY BIT.

212
00:15:28,916 --> 00:15:30,833
BIT BY BIT.
- SOMETHING--

213
00:15:30,916 --> 00:15:33,250
- ( woman screams )

214
00:15:33,333 --> 00:15:36,250
- Rino: BIT BY BIT,
BIT BY BIT.

215
00:15:36,333 --> 00:15:38,916
BIT BY BIT.
- THIS FEELING.

216
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,041
- Rino: BIT BY BIT.
- Woman: I HEAR...

217
00:15:41,125 --> 00:15:43,083
- BIT BY BIT, BIT BY BIT.
- ...THE PULSE...

218
00:15:43,166 --> 00:15:45,875
- BIT BY BIT.
- ...OF THE AWAKENING...

219
00:15:50,291 --> 00:15:54,166
...ALONG THE MOONLIGHT
THAT HAUNTS THE DARKNESS.

220
00:15:57,250 --> 00:16:01,000
IT WILL WITH CERTAINTY
PROVIDE THE TIME.

221
00:16:02,416 --> 00:16:04,333
THE PULSE
OF THE AWAKENING,

222
00:16:04,416 --> 00:16:06,333
THE LAST BEAT.

223
00:16:06,416 --> 00:16:10,541
THE MASTER RIDES
ACROSS THE MOONLIGHT.

224
00:16:10,625 --> 00:16:12,083
- Rino: VINCE.

225
00:16:12,166 --> 00:16:14,875
- Vincent: NO.
HELP ME.

226
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:18,208
I DON'T WANT
TO CHANGE INTO--

227
00:16:18,291 --> 00:16:21,541
I DON'T KNOW.
WHAT WAS THAT THING?

228
00:16:21,625 --> 00:16:23,541
WHAT WILL I BECOME?

229
00:16:23,625 --> 00:16:25,500
JUST STOP IT.

230
00:16:26,958 --> 00:16:30,250
- WE FAILED TO STOP
THE ENCROACHMENT IN AREA 32.

231
00:16:30,333 --> 00:16:33,541
ASURAN TROOPS NUMBER
APPROXIMATELY 30 PER PLATOON.

232
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:36,750
THEY'RE NOW ADVANCING
TOWARDS AREA 15.

233
00:16:36,833 --> 00:16:39,333
- THEY WANT THE MOSQUITO?

234
00:16:39,416 --> 00:16:42,000
ALL PERSONNEL
TO BATTLE STATIONS.

235
00:16:42,083 --> 00:16:44,208
DEFEND THE MOSQUITO
AT ALL COSTS.

236
00:16:44,291 --> 00:16:47,666
I WANT TWO PLATOONS DEPLOYED
TO DEFEND THE PRODUCTION ROOM.

237
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:50,458
EVERYONE ELSE, HEAD TO
THE HELIPORT IMMEDIATELY.

238
00:16:50,541 --> 00:16:52,458
- ( rapid gunfire )

239
00:17:07,125 --> 00:17:09,083
- ( alarm whooping )

240
00:17:35,333 --> 00:17:36,916
- NO.

241
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,875
PLEASE DON'T.

242
00:17:51,208 --> 00:17:53,125
- ( man over headphone )
Commander, Asuran forces

243
00:17:53,208 --> 00:17:55,250
have infiltrated
the underground facility.

244
00:17:55,333 --> 00:17:57,166
Sir, they're going to--

245
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:05,791
- IT'S OVER.

246
00:18:11,041 --> 00:18:13,500
- YOU COWARD!
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

247
00:18:13,583 --> 00:18:15,833
- WE CAN'T ALL FIT
IN THIS THING.

248
00:18:15,916 --> 00:18:17,833
AND WE CAN'T REBUILD
OUR UNIT,

249
00:18:17,916 --> 00:18:20,625
NOT WITHOUT
THE PRODUCTION ROOM.

250
00:18:20,708 --> 00:18:21,750
- DAMN YOU.

251
00:18:27,416 --> 00:18:29,125
WHAT THE--?
WHAT ARE YOU?

252
00:18:35,583 --> 00:18:37,458
- GET US OUT OF HERE!

253
00:18:42,875 --> 00:18:45,625
- SIR, LOOK.  IT'S THE THING
THAT WOMAN WAS TALKING ABOUT.

254
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:47,583
- JUST LIKE
THE LEGEND SAID.

255
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:56,250
- GOTCHA, YOU BASTARD!

256
00:19:02,916 --> 00:19:04,041
- MOVE!  COME ON!

257
00:19:12,166 --> 00:19:13,583
WHAT ARE--?

258
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:22,916
- ( screams )

259
00:20:02,041 --> 00:20:03,958
- Woman: SENEX.

260
00:20:06,791 --> 00:20:08,916
AGENT OF THE MOONLIGHT.

261
00:20:19,375 --> 00:20:20,666
- ( Rino screams )

262
00:21:02,166 --> 00:21:05,458
- Woman: THE DRUMS OF WAR
ARE BEATING.

263
00:21:07,875 --> 00:21:10,083
IT IS THE MUSIC
THAT BRINGS

264
00:21:10,166 --> 00:21:13,083
THE BIRTH
OF A NEW WORLD.

265
00:21:35,958 --> 00:21:37,875
THE MASTER COMES,

266
00:21:37,958 --> 00:21:39,875
RIDING ACROSS
THE MOONLIGHT

267
00:21:39,958 --> 00:21:43,375
THAT HAUNTS THE SHADOWS
IN THE DARK PLACES.

268
00:21:43,458 --> 00:21:46,083
IT'S ALL SO BEAUTIFUL.

269
00:22:33,666 --> 00:22:36,583
- ( creature moaning )

270
00:23:14,166 --> 00:23:16,500
- Woman: WHEN THE BATTLE'S DONE,

271
00:23:16,583 --> 00:23:18,750
HE WILL BRING

272
00:23:18,833 --> 00:23:20,750
TO THIS WORLD

273
00:23:20,833 --> 00:23:23,625
A GIFT OF DEATH.

274
00:24:29,625 --> 00:24:39,583
- WHO ARE YOU?

275
00:24:39,666 --> 00:24:50,500
