00:01:05,625 --> 00:01:07,791
RE-L, VINCE!

7
00:01:07,875 --> 00:01:10,541
HEY, VINCE. RE-L GOT TIRED OF
WAITING FOR YOU TO COME BACK 

8
00:01:10,625 --> 00:01:12,166
AND WENT OUT BY HERSELF.

9
00:01:13,625 --> 00:01:17,875
HELLO?

10
00:01:17,958 --> 00:01:19,875
RE-L?
ARE YOU BACK?

11
00:01:19,958 --> 00:01:22,875
I WAITED HERE
JUST LIKE YOU TOLD ME TO.

12
00:01:22,958 --> 00:01:24,833
SHE'S NOT HERE.

FINE.  I'M LEAVING TOO.

DO YOU HAVE COGITO TOO?

32
00:04:35,833 --> 00:04:37,083
ARE YOU HUNGRY?

33
00:04:37,166 --> 00:04:38,750
ARE YOU OKAY?

34
00:04:38,833 --> 00:04:43,416
- I HAVE BEEN LIBERATED
FROM MY DESIGNATED EXISTENCE.

35
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:48,375
I WANT TO UNDERSTAND
WHY I AM HERE...

- ( yelps )

37
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:55,416
SO YOU WANT TO KNOW
WHY YOU'RE YOU?

38
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:56,666
HMM.

39
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:35,125
- DAMN.

40
00:05:35,208 --> 00:05:36,750
ABOUT TIME.

00:05:38,541 --> 00:05:39,416

IS THAT YOU?

45
00:05:54,916 --> 00:05:55,791
VINCENT?

46
00:05:58,541 --> 00:05:59,833
- OH.

47
00:05:59,916 --> 00:06:02,833
IT'S HIS EXCELLENCY'S
GRANDDAUGHTER.

48
00:06:02,916 --> 00:06:04,500
HELLO, YOUNG LADY.

49
00:06:04,583 --> 00:06:08,833
- AUTOREIV DISPOSAL?

50
00:06:13,583 --> 00:06:16,375
- Petro: VINCENT LAW.

51
00:06:16,458 --> 00:06:18,833
YEAH, HE WAS KIND OF
AN AWKWARD KID,

52
00:06:18,916 --> 00:06:20,500
BUT HE GOT THE JOB DONE,
ALL RIGHT.

53
00:06:20,583 --> 00:06:22,416
I NEVER IMAGINED
THAT ONE DAY

54
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,250
YOU'D FIND THE LIKES OF US
DISPOSING OF

55
00:06:24,333 --> 00:06:25,791
EVERY SINGLE ENTOURAGE.

56
00:06:25,875 --> 00:06:27,416
I'LL GIVE THAT
VINCENT KID CREDIT,

57
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:29,625
HE SAW THAT COMING.
- HUH?

58
00:06:29,708 --> 00:06:31,541
- YOU'RE KIDDING.
YOU DON'T KNOW?

59
00:06:31,625 --> 00:06:34,208
THIS WHOLE PROBLEM'S
JUST ABOUT GONE CRITICAL.

60
00:06:34,291 --> 00:06:36,541
WE GOT TOO USED TO
RELYING ON ENTOURAGES.

61
00:06:36,625 --> 00:06:39,208
- THIS IS ALL THE COGITO
VIRUS'S FAULT.

62
00:06:39,291 --> 00:06:40,958
YEAH, IF WE HAD
JUST BEEN MORE CAREFUL

63
00:06:41,041 --> 00:06:42,666
SCREENING AUTOREIVS 
WITHIN CITY LIMITS--

64
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:43,958
- I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU,
WALTER.

65
00:06:44,041 --> 00:06:45,666
YOU'RE MISSING
THE ENTIRE POINT.

66
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:47,708
WE DIDN'T ACTUALLY NEED
ALL THESE AUTOREIVS

67
00:06:47,791 --> 00:06:49,208
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

68
00:06:49,291 --> 00:06:53,208
WOULDN'T YOU AGREE WITH THAT,
YOUR EXCELLENCY?

69
00:06:53,291 --> 00:06:54,375
- UH...

70
00:06:54,458 --> 00:06:56,083
- CITIZENS ARE DYING
ALL OVER THE PLACE, 

71
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:58,291
AND WHAT'S BEING DONE?
NOTHING.

72
00:06:58,375 --> 00:06:59,541
SERIOUSLY.

73
00:06:59,625 --> 00:07:01,291
WHAT'S THE CENTRAL
ADMINISTRATIVE BUREAU

74
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:02,875
SUPPOSED TO DO
ABOUT THIS?

75
00:07:02,958 --> 00:07:05,416
WITH ALL THE ENTOURAGE
AUTOREIVS OUT OF COMMISSION,

76
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:08,250
THOSE GUYS CAN BARELY 
ORDER THEIR OWN LUNCH.

77
00:07:08,333 --> 00:07:09,916
AM I RIGHT?

78
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,583
- HEY, YOU HEARD
ALL THIS SHIT

79
00:07:11,666 --> 00:07:13,916
ABOUT THE SECURITY CHIEF
GOING A.W.O.L?

80
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,583
- HEY! DON'T BE USING...
- RAUL CREED IS MISSING?

81
00:07:17,666 --> 00:07:19,916
- SO, WHAT DO YOU THINK
THAT LIGHT WAS?

82
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,458
- WHAT LIGHT?

83
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:22,916
- UH...

84
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,250
- THERE WAS THIS BIG
COLUMN OF LIGHT

85
00:07:24,333 --> 00:07:26,583
ABOUT TWO MONTHS AGO,
AND I WAS--

86
00:07:26,666 --> 00:07:28,041
- WHAT HE'S TRYING TO SAY

87
00:07:28,125 --> 00:07:29,375
IS IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT,

88
00:07:29,458 --> 00:07:31,166
IT SEEMS LIKE A LOT OF
THE RECENT CRAZINESS

89
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:33,916
DIDN'T KICK INTO HIGH GEAR
UNTIL AFTER THAT LIGHT.

90
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:34,875
- ( gasps )

91
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:41,375
- PLEASE.

92
00:07:41,458 --> 00:07:43,375
DON'T LET STUFF LIKE THIS
BOTHER YOU.

93
00:07:43,458 --> 00:07:45,333
IT'S NOTHING BUT
A CRAZY RUMOR.

94
00:07:45,416 --> 00:07:46,916
- ( laughs )
- SHUSH!

95
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,833
ANYWAY, WITH ALL
THE CITIZENS IN TROUBLE

96
00:07:48,916 --> 00:07:50,500
AND THINGS BEING
WHAT THEY ARE,

97
00:07:50,583 --> 00:07:53,291
ALL WE IMMIGRANTS NEED TO DO 
TO BECOME CITIZENS THESE DAYS

98
00:07:53,375 --> 00:07:54,958
IS WORK REAL HARD.

99
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:56,458
PLEASE, IF YOU GET A CHANCE,

100
00:07:56,541 --> 00:07:59,500
PUT IN A GOOD WORD WITH US
FOR THE REGENT, IF YOU COULD?

101
00:07:59,583 --> 00:08:02,625
- REPORT!  WE'VE LOCATED
THREE MORE INFECTED AUTOREIVS,

102
00:08:02,708 --> 00:08:03,958
POINT FOUR CLICKS.

103
00:08:04,041 --> 00:08:06,666
- FIRST COMBAT POSITIONS!

104
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:08,958
WE'RE TAKING BACK
THE MAINLAND.

105
00:08:09,041 --> 00:08:10,958
- ALL RIGHT,
LET'S POP SOME AUTOREIVS.

106
00:08:11,041 --> 00:08:12,958
- GOOD-BYE,
YOUR EXCELLENCY.

107
00:08:13,041 --> 00:08:14,625
AND GOOD LUCK
GETTING HOME.

108
00:08:14,708 --> 00:08:16,291
- ALL RIGHT, MEN.
WE'RE ON THE HUNT.

109
00:08:16,375 --> 00:08:17,583
- FOR ROMDEAU!

110
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:20,208
- ( sighs )

111
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:22,291
HOME?

112
00:08:22,375 --> 00:08:24,666
AND WHERE'S THAT?

113
00:08:26,375 --> 00:08:27,916
( sighs )

114
00:08:29,791 --> 00:08:31,666
THE CITY IS COLLAPSING
AROUND THEM

115
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:34,000
AND NO ONE'S
TOLD THEM ANYTHING.

116
00:08:34,083 --> 00:08:35,291
IT'S TERRIBLE.

117
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:39,000
WHAT CAN THEY DO?

118
00:08:39,083 --> 00:08:40,958
WHAT CAN I DO,
FOR THAT MATTER?

119
00:08:44,416 --> 00:08:46,666
AS SOON AS WE ARRIVED
AT THE GATES OF ROMDEAU,

120
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:49,666
VINCENT LAW DISAPPEARED.

121
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:51,125
OVER THE LAST TWO DAYS,

122
00:08:51,208 --> 00:08:52,541
THERE HAVE BEEN SEVERAL
SIGHTINGS OF HIM

123
00:08:52,625 --> 00:08:54,000
AROUND THE CITY,

124
00:08:54,083 --> 00:08:56,666
BUT ONLY AS ERGO PROXY.

125
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:59,000
THERE IS SADNESS TO HIM.

126
00:08:59,083 --> 00:09:01,291
HE HASN'T YET
INTERACTED WITH ANYONE.

127
00:09:03,083 --> 00:09:05,625
THAT WHICH IS DIVIDED
MUST BECOME ONE.

128
00:09:07,416 --> 00:09:10,000
WHEN VINCENT LAW
AND ERGO PROXY BECAME ONE,

129
00:09:10,083 --> 00:09:13,666
WHAT WAS NOW LEFT OF THE
MAN I HAD COME TO KNOW?

130
00:09:15,458 --> 00:09:17,666
I SHOULD HAVE.
RIGHT THEN.

131
00:09:24,291 --> 00:09:25,666
- ( gasps )

132
00:09:27,041 --> 00:09:29,958
- ( men shouting )

133
00:09:30,041 --> 00:09:31,708
- DON'T LET THEM GET AWAY!

134
00:09:31,791 --> 00:09:32,958
- DIE!

135
00:09:33,041 --> 00:09:35,375
- YOU BASTARDS!
- YEAH!

136
00:09:35,458 --> 00:09:37,041
- COME ON!

137
00:09:37,125 --> 00:09:38,333
- GET 'EM!

138
00:09:41,458 --> 00:09:43,041
- Woman's Voice: 
"FELLOW CITIZENS:

139
00:09:43,125 --> 00:09:44,375
STAY IN YOUR HOMES.

140
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:46,375
A CURFEW IS IN EFFECT.

141
00:09:46,458 --> 00:09:48,458
WE ASK THAT YOU
WAIT TO RECEIVE INSTRUCTIONS

142
00:09:48,541 --> 00:09:51,041
FROM THE CITIZEN'S
INTELLIGENCE BUREAU.

143
00:09:51,125 --> 00:09:53,416
ANYONE CAUGHT BREAKING CURFEW
WITHOUT PERMISSION

144
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,416
WILL BE PUNISHED."

145
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:58,750
- Re-L: ONCE, THIS CLOCKWORK
PARADISE BORED ME,

146
00:09:58,833 --> 00:10:02,083
SO I PRAYED FOR CHANGE.
ANY CHANGE.

147
00:10:02,166 --> 00:10:04,750
I NOW HAVE TO WONDER
IF THOSE AWFUL PRAYERS

148
00:10:04,833 --> 00:10:07,583
WERE THE CATALYST
THAT WOKE THE SLEEPING ERGO

149
00:10:07,666 --> 00:10:09,708
WITHIN VINCENT.

150
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:14,375
AM I RESPONSIBLE
FOR ALL THIS?

151
00:10:21,333 --> 00:10:23,750
- HMM.

152
00:10:23,833 --> 00:10:25,875
RE-L MAYER.

153
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:28,875
WHATEVER HAPPENED WITH THAT
MEDICAL PAPERWORK ISSUE?

154
00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:31,875
HAVE MY ENTOURAGE
FILE EVERYTHING AS USUAL.

155
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:34,750
- WHAT'S GOING ON
AROUND HERE?

156
00:10:34,833 --> 00:10:36,666
- THINGS ARE PILING UP.

157
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:39,291
YOU WOULD NOT BELIEVE 
WHAT I'M DEALING WITH.

158
00:10:39,375 --> 00:10:41,791
- THOSE PEOPLE OUT THERE
ARE DYING.

159
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:44,041
IS IT THE VIRUS,
OR IS IT--?

160
00:10:44,125 --> 00:10:46,958
- ISOLATING THE IMMIGRATION
DISTRICT WAS A NIGHTMARE.

161
00:10:47,041 --> 00:10:49,875
ALL THIS TROUBLE JUST FOR
CONFIRMATION DATA

162
00:10:49,958 --> 00:10:51,791
ON THE A.D.W. PROJECT.

163
00:10:51,875 --> 00:10:55,458
IT'S JUST FRUSTRATING
IN MY POSITION.

164
00:10:55,541 --> 00:10:56,875
WELL, TO BE FAIR,

165
00:10:56,958 --> 00:10:58,833
BEING FRUSTRATED
DOES COME WITH THE JOB.

166
00:11:01,541 --> 00:11:03,333
- THE A.D.W. PROJECT?

167
00:11:03,416 --> 00:11:06,458
- THIS IS OUR FIRST EXPERIMENT
WITH MARTIAL LAW PROVISIONS.

168
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:09,458
THE SECURITY BUREAU LOVES
TO TALK THEMSELVES UP,

169
00:11:09,541 --> 00:11:11,208
BUT WELL, THAT'S RIGHT.

170
00:11:11,291 --> 00:11:13,125
IT WAS THAT MAN
YOU TOLD ME ABOUT.

171
00:11:13,208 --> 00:11:15,333
HE IS ONE RUDE 
SON OF A BITCH,

172
00:11:15,416 --> 00:11:17,250
BUT VERY EFFECTIVE.
( chuckles )

173
00:11:17,333 --> 00:11:18,833
- ( men shouting )
- YEAH, I GOT HIM!

174
00:11:18,916 --> 00:11:21,166
THERE'S ANOTHER ONE.
DON'T LET IT GET AWAY!

175
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:23,750
HURRY, FOLLOW ME.
FOLLOW ME!

176
00:11:24,833 --> 00:11:26,166
- Re-L:
WHERE IS HE?

177
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:28,750
WHERE IS RAUL CREED?

178
00:11:28,833 --> 00:11:30,166
- ( sighs )

179
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:32,833
HE'S JUST A LITTLE TOO
CLEVER FOR HIS OWN GOOD.

180
00:11:32,916 --> 00:11:34,833
WE DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES

181
00:11:34,916 --> 00:11:36,375
TO KEEP TRACK OF--
- MY GRANDFATHER--

182
00:11:36,458 --> 00:11:38,500
- OVERFLOWING WITH 
NEEDS TODAY, I SEE.

183
00:11:38,583 --> 00:11:41,000
- WHAT IS THE REGENT 
DOING ABOUT ALL THIS?

184
00:11:41,083 --> 00:11:42,333
- OH, YES.

185
00:11:42,416 --> 00:11:44,500
IT'S PERFECT THAT
HE HEAR IT FROM YOU.

186
00:11:44,583 --> 00:11:46,750
I HAVE SOMETHING 
THAT NEEDS DOING.

187
00:11:46,833 --> 00:11:48,833
THIS IS ALL THE DATA
THE HEALTH AND WELFARE BUREAU

188
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:50,833
HAVE COMPILED ON
THE SHORT-TERM SIDE EFFECTS

189
00:11:50,916 --> 00:11:53,250
OF THE A.D.W. PROJECT.

190
00:11:53,333 --> 00:11:55,166
DELIVER THIS TO THE REGENT,
PLEASE.

191
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:58,166
I THINK IT'D BE BEST
IF HE HEARD IT FROM YOU.

192
00:11:58,250 --> 00:11:59,541
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

193
00:11:59,625 --> 00:12:01,208
- IT'S AN ABSOLUTE FAILURE.

194
00:12:01,291 --> 00:12:03,541
MORTALITY RATES ARE
SITTING AROUND 90%.

195
00:12:03,625 --> 00:12:06,708
IT SEEMS DAEDALUS'S FREE RIDE
IS COMING TO AN END.

196
00:12:08,291 --> 00:12:09,791
HONESTLY,
I DON'T KNOW WHY THEY THOUGHT

197
00:12:09,875 --> 00:12:12,541
WE NEEDED TO CHANGE
EVERYTHING IN THE FIRST PLACE.

198
00:12:12,625 --> 00:12:15,875
IF OUR FELLOW CITIZENS HAD JUST
KEPT ORDER WITHIN THE DOME,

199
00:12:15,958 --> 00:12:17,541
EVERYTHING WOULD BE FINE.

200
00:12:17,625 --> 00:12:19,875
IT'S HOW WE'VE
ALWAYS SURVIVED.

201
00:12:19,958 --> 00:12:23,375
WE SHOULD HAVE JUST
STUCK TO WHAT WE KNEW WORKED.

202
00:12:23,458 --> 00:12:26,541
DON'T FORGET ABOUT TOMORROW.
- WHAT?

203
00:12:26,625 --> 00:12:29,375
- BRING IN YOUR
MEDICAL PAPERWORK.

204
00:12:29,458 --> 00:12:30,666
- ( sighs )

205
00:12:32,916 --> 00:12:34,166
- AND TAKE CARE.

206
00:12:37,625 --> 00:12:39,875
- Re-L:
WE RELIED ON ENTOURAGES,

207
00:12:39,958 --> 00:12:41,250
ON THE COLLECTIVE,

208
00:12:41,333 --> 00:12:44,583
AND ON THE REGENT
FOR EVERYTHING WE WERE.

209
00:12:44,666 --> 00:12:46,916
IS THIS WHAT
THE END WILL LOOK LIKE

210
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,916
FOR OUR LAST
FELLOW CITIZENS?

211
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,166
- Daedalus: RE-L. I'VE BEEN
LOOKING ALL OVER FOR YOU.

212
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:55,250
- DAEDALUS.

213
00:12:55,333 --> 00:12:57,250
- SO THIS IS WHERE 
YOU'VE BEEN HIDING.

214
00:12:57,333 --> 00:13:01,083
ALWAYS WANDERING AROUND.
GOOD, LET'S GO.

215
00:13:02,666 --> 00:13:03,875
- DAEDALUS...

216
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:41,291
- MOVE.  MOVE.

217
00:13:41,375 --> 00:13:42,375
MOVE!

218
00:13:56,541 --> 00:13:58,458
- MONAD PROXY.

219
00:14:14,416 --> 00:14:18,625
I KNOW THAT I'M THE ONE 
WHO KILLED YOU, BUT WHY?

220
00:14:18,708 --> 00:14:22,000
WHY DID YOU DO THIS TO HER?

221
00:14:22,083 --> 00:14:23,958
DONOV MAYER.

222
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:27,625
( gasps )

223
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:39,125
( sighs )

224
00:14:43,625 --> 00:14:46,666
- MCQ: THE CORRECT ANSWER
WAS PROXY ONE.

225
00:14:49,125 --> 00:14:52,041
- PROXY ONE.

226
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:54,708
( gasps )
- ARE YOU SAD?

227
00:14:54,791 --> 00:14:56,000
- ( growls )

228
00:15:01,208 --> 00:15:03,500
( grunts )

229
00:15:05,125 --> 00:15:07,541
- THE PENDANT.
- ( gasps )

230
00:15:07,625 --> 00:15:09,583
- ( gasps )

231
00:15:09,666 --> 00:15:11,375
IT'S A VERY PRETTY SHAPE.

232
00:15:11,458 --> 00:15:13,041
- ( gasps )

233
00:15:13,125 --> 00:15:15,375
LOOK AT ME.
I'M TERRIFYING.

234
00:15:15,458 --> 00:15:17,708
WHY AREN'T YOU
AFRAID OF ME? 

235
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:19,041
TELL ME.

236
00:15:19,125 --> 00:15:20,708
- BECAUSE.

237
00:15:20,791 --> 00:15:23,708
YOU HAVE SUCH A GENTLE
EXPRESSION ON YOUR FACE.

238
00:15:23,791 --> 00:15:26,458
HOW CAN I BE AFRAID OF ONE
WITH A KIND FACE?

239
00:15:26,541 --> 00:15:28,083
THEY MATCH.

240
00:15:28,166 --> 00:15:30,291
DO BOTH OF THEM
BELONG TO YOU? 

241
00:15:30,375 --> 00:15:31,416
- I THINK--

242
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:34,083
I THINK ONE OF THEM
WAS MONAD'S.

243
00:15:34,166 --> 00:15:35,291
- YOU LOVED HER.

244
00:15:35,375 --> 00:15:37,041
MONAD.

245
00:15:37,125 --> 00:15:38,541
- ( gasps )

246
00:15:38,625 --> 00:15:39,750
- ( sighs )

247
00:15:39,833 --> 00:15:42,041
YOU POOR THING.

248
00:15:42,125 --> 00:15:43,375
- ( gasps )

249
00:15:43,458 --> 00:15:44,708
- I KNOW HOW YOU FEEL.

250
00:15:44,791 --> 00:15:47,083
I LOVED HER TOO.

251
00:15:47,166 --> 00:15:49,041
- WHO THE HELL ARE YOU?

252
00:15:49,125 --> 00:15:52,541
- MY NAME IS RE-L MAYER.

253
00:15:52,625 --> 00:15:54,750
- THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE.

254
00:15:54,833 --> 00:15:56,750
- NO.

255
00:15:56,833 --> 00:15:58,500
IT'S JUST THAT I'M
SUPPOSED TO--

256
00:15:58,583 --> 00:16:01,041
( exhales )

257
00:16:04,166 --> 00:16:06,000
I'M RE-L MAYER.

258
00:16:06,083 --> 00:16:07,291
- ( gasps )

259
00:16:18,666 --> 00:16:20,250
- ( crying )

260
00:16:24,541 --> 00:16:26,458
WHAT HAPPENED BACK THERE?

261
00:16:26,541 --> 00:16:28,125
OH, I KNOW.

262
00:16:28,208 --> 00:16:30,041
THAT WAS VINCENT.

263
00:16:31,125 --> 00:16:32,916
IT HAD TO BE.

264
00:16:39,208 --> 00:16:41,583
- I'M SO SORRY,
DAEDALUS.

265
00:16:41,666 --> 00:16:44,583
- THAT'S ENOUGH, RE-L.

266
00:16:44,666 --> 00:16:48,458
THERE'S NO NEED TO IMITATE
THAT HORRIBLE GIRL.

267
00:16:48,541 --> 00:16:49,750
JUST BE YOURSELF.

268
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:53,500
- I COULDN'T DO IT.

269
00:16:53,583 --> 00:16:56,583
I MANAGED TO FAIL
AT EVERYTHING I PROMISED TO DO.

270
00:16:56,666 --> 00:16:59,166
I FAILED TO RECAPTURE
THE PROXY,

271
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:02,125
I DIDN'T COLLECT
A SINGLE SPECIMEN.

272
00:17:02,208 --> 00:17:04,500
- RE-L, WHY ARE YOU
STILL DOING THIS?

273
00:17:04,583 --> 00:17:06,500
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?

274
00:17:06,583 --> 00:17:08,500
DID YOU GET OVERWRITTEN
BY OLD DATA?

275
00:17:08,583 --> 00:17:09,833
- WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

276
00:17:09,916 --> 00:17:12,166
- HAVE YOU BEEN STEALING
DATA FROM MY TERMINAL?

277
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:14,500
TRYING TO GIVE ME
A SCARE OR SOMETHING?

278
00:17:14,583 --> 00:17:15,625
JUST STOP.

279
00:17:15,708 --> 00:17:18,166
YOU KNOW I HATE
THAT KIND OF THING.

280
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:19,375
- TALK TO ME.

281
00:17:19,458 --> 00:17:21,083
WHY HAVE THE ROMDEAU
POPULATION LEVELS

282
00:17:21,166 --> 00:17:22,375
STARTED TO PLUMMET?

283
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:25,041
IS THIS PART OF
THE A.D.W. PROJECT?

284
00:17:25,125 --> 00:17:26,708
I'VE TALKED TO THE CHIEF.

285
00:17:26,791 --> 00:17:28,125
WHAT THE HELL 
HAVE YOU DONE?

286
00:17:28,208 --> 00:17:31,125
- Daedalus:
YOU'RE HURTING ME.

287
00:17:31,208 --> 00:17:33,541
- ( gasps )
I'M SORRY. 

288
00:17:33,625 --> 00:17:35,208
- WHO ARE YOU?

289
00:17:35,291 --> 00:17:36,541
- WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

290
00:17:36,625 --> 00:17:38,875
- YOU ARE DEFINITELY
NOT MY RE-L.

291
00:17:38,958 --> 00:17:40,875
- DAEDALUS.
- I SEE.

292
00:17:40,958 --> 00:17:43,208
I KNOW WHAT YOU ARE.

293
00:17:43,291 --> 00:17:44,958
YOU'RE THE TRAITOR.

294
00:17:45,041 --> 00:17:46,541
- ( gasps )

295
00:17:46,625 --> 00:17:49,000
- RE-L, COME ON OUT.

296
00:17:49,083 --> 00:17:50,666
- DAEDALUS.

297
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:52,708
- YOU'RE HURTING ME.
LET GO.

298
00:17:54,625 --> 00:17:56,125
- ANSWER ME.

299
00:18:01,958 --> 00:18:04,791
- WHAT'S IT LOOK LIKE?
- THERE'S ONE OVER THERE.

300
00:18:06,958 --> 00:18:08,833
HUH?  UM, CHIEF?

301
00:18:08,916 --> 00:18:10,541
I THINK I'VE SEEN
THIS ONE BEFORE. 

302
00:18:10,625 --> 00:18:12,833
- LET ME HAVE A LOOK.
HMM.

303
00:18:14,666 --> 00:18:16,458
WELL, LOOK AT WHAT
WE HAVE HERE.

304
00:18:16,541 --> 00:18:19,916
BOYS, I THINK WE'VE
JUST GOT A PROMOTION.

305
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,500
ALL IT TAKES IS
SOMETHING LIKE THIS

306
00:18:21,583 --> 00:18:23,166
TO GET YOURSELF NOTICED.

307
00:18:32,666 --> 00:18:34,250
- ( grunts )

308
00:18:34,333 --> 00:18:35,625
HMM?

309
00:18:44,625 --> 00:18:47,541
- Derrida:
NOW YOU SHOW YOURSELF.

310
00:18:47,625 --> 00:18:50,583
- Lacan:
NOW THAT IT'S MUCH TOO LATE.

311
00:18:50,666 --> 00:18:53,583
- Berkeley:
WHAT DO YOU PLAN ON DOING NOW?

312
00:18:53,666 --> 00:18:55,958
- Husserl:
TIME HAS ALREADY RUN OUT.

313
00:18:58,375 --> 00:19:00,416
CREATOR.

314
00:19:14,375 --> 00:19:16,625
- THE WOMBSYS 
HAS SHUT DOWN.

315
00:19:16,708 --> 00:19:18,958
BUT I THINK YOU
KNEW THAT ALREADY.

316
00:19:19,041 --> 00:19:21,625
- 'CAUSE MONAD-- NO.

317
00:19:21,708 --> 00:19:23,416
'CAUSE VINCENT'S GONE.

318
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,416
- SO RAUL CAME UP
WITH THE IDEA

319
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,291
THAT WE SHOULD TRY
AND CHANGE OURSELVES

320
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:29,875
INTO SOMETHING THAT
WOULDN'T NEED THE PROXY.

321
00:19:29,958 --> 00:19:31,916
THAT'S HOW THE A.D.W.
PROJECT WAS BORN.

322
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,625
A GRAND ATTEMPT TO
RECONFIGURE THE HUMAN BODY.

323
00:19:34,708 --> 00:19:36,875
NOT THAT IT WAS
EVER GOING TO WORK.

324
00:19:36,958 --> 00:19:39,541
- IF THAT'S TRUE, THEN WHY DID
YOU AGREE TO GO ALONG WITH THIS?

325
00:19:39,625 --> 00:19:41,125
- THE RAPTURE.
- ( gasps )

326

- YOU KNOW THE RAPTURE.
THAT COLUMN OF LIGHT YOU SAW?

327
00:19:45,625 --> 00:19:50,000
IT WOULD APPEAR THAT RAUL
DOES NOT LIKE BEING THE LOSER.

328
00:19:50,083 --> 00:19:52,333
- LOSER?

329

- OR MAYBE WINNER.

330
00:19:54,333 --> 00:19:57,333
SO YOU MANAGED
TO SURVIVE ALL THIS.

00:19:57,416 --> 00:19:59,750
DOES THAT MEAN HE'S
HERE AS WELL?

AS HARD AS IT IS
TO BELIEVE,

335
00:20:06,291 --> 00:20:09,333
RAUL WAS NOT THE ONE WHO
ORDERED THE ATTACK ON YOU.

336

- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

- I THINK THIS IS YOUR FLOOR.

338
00:20:14,875 --> 00:20:18,000
NOW WHY DON'T YOU GO AND
TALK TO THE MAN IN CHARGE?
