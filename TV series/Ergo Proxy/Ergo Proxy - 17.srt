IT'S TOO LATE, SIR.

12
00:01:22,583 --> 00:01:24,625
SORRY, REGENT.

13
00:01:24,708 --> 00:01:26,916
I'M NOT A FELLOW
CITIZEN ANYMORE.

14
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:41,333
- THERE'S NO NEED
TO SHOW ME I.D., SIR.

15
00:01:41,416 --> 00:01:44,666
- PROTOCOL MUST
ALWAYS BE MAINTAINED.

16
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:46,291

140 MILES TODAY,

00:03:51,458 --> 00:03:52,791
SO THAT MEANS
WE'RE AROUND HERE?

35
00:03:52,875 --> 00:03:54,916
- VERY GOOD.

00:03:58,208 --> 00:03:59,625
- Re-L:
WE'RE CLOSING IN ON MOSK.

38
00:03:59,708 --> 00:04:03,375
BIRTHPLACE OF
VINCENT LAW, 

39
00:04:03,458 --> 00:04:04,791
AND...

40
00:04:04,875 --> 00:04:07,458
THE CITY WHERE
THE MYSTERY OF THE PROXY

41
00:04:07,541 --> 00:04:09,333
AWAITS.

42
00:04:13,875 --> 00:04:16,416
- ( playing melodica )

43
00:04:18,958 --> 00:04:21,625
- Vincent: WHO AM I?

44
00:04:21,708 --> 00:04:24,000
REALLY?

45
00:04:24,083 --> 00:04:27,833
- I DON'T KNOW WHY
I EVEN BOTHER ASKING.

46
00:04:27,916 --> 00:04:29,833
YOU DON'T REMEMBER ANYTHING.

47
00:04:29,916 --> 00:04:32,666
- DID I FORGET ON PURPOSE?

48
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:37,333
WAS WHATEVER HAPPENED
TO ME THAT HORRIBLE? 

49
00:04:39,708 --> 00:04:41,333
IF I--

50
00:04:41,416 --> 00:04:43,291
IF I CAN'T BE ME ANYMORE,

51
00:04:43,375 --> 00:04:46,166
I'D RATHER IT END.

52
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:48,166
YOU UNDERSTAND?

53
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:50,125
I'LL NEED YOU TO KILL ME.

54
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:55,166
- THAT'S THE PLAN.

55
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:58,125
I'M SAVING THIS
LAST BULLET FOR YOU.

56
00:05:00,916 --> 00:05:03,875
BUT BEFORE I SHOOT YOU,
WE NEED TO GET TO MOSK.

57
00:05:03,958 --> 00:05:05,083
COME ON.

58
00:05:15,625 --> 00:05:17,000
- PINO!

59
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:18,541
PINO!

60
00:05:18,625 --> 00:05:19,916
( panting )

61
00:05:23,958 --> 00:05:25,166
( gasps )

62
00:05:40,541 --> 00:05:41,875
- HMM.

63
00:05:41,958 --> 00:05:45,250
- Daedalus: IT PROVOKES 
THE SAME REACTION IN ME.

64
00:05:45,333 --> 00:05:48,750
IT'S UNSETTLING,
ISN'T IT?

65
00:05:48,833 --> 00:05:51,750
- NOT UNLIKE A COFFIN.

66
00:05:51,833 --> 00:05:54,916
- SOMETIMES I IMAGINE
I'M A WALKING CORPSE,

67
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,916
BORN FROM A COFFIN WOMB.

68
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,583
- WHAT DID THE REGENT SAY?

69
00:05:58,666 --> 00:06:00,583
- THE USUAL.

70
00:06:00,666 --> 00:06:03,583
HE SAID TO IGNORE IT
AND WE'LL DEAL WITH IT LATER.

71
00:06:03,666 --> 00:06:07,625
- THE CITY CAN'T GO ON
LIKE THIS MUCH LONGER.

72
00:06:07,708 --> 00:06:09,583
- I TOLD YOU BEFORE,

73
00:06:09,666 --> 00:06:12,916
THIS SORT OF POWER WOULD HAVE
SIGNIFICANT IMPLICATIONS.

74
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,916
- WE WON'T LAST LONG
WITHOUT A PROXY.

75
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,625
STILL...

76
00:06:18,708 --> 00:06:23,041
IT'S NOT THE END OF THE WORLD.
NOT YET.

77
00:06:23,125 --> 00:06:24,708
- MM-HMM.
( chuckles )

78
00:06:24,791 --> 00:06:27,583
YOU'RE TOO EMOTIONAL
TO BE REASONABLE.

79
00:06:27,666 --> 00:06:29,625
- AND YOU'RE TOO DETACHED.

80
00:06:29,708 --> 00:06:32,958
CONSIDERING YOUR PRECIOUS
RE-L ABANDONED ROMDEAU

81
00:06:33,041 --> 00:06:35,625
AND MALICIOUSLY
BETRAYED YOU.

82
00:06:35,708 --> 00:06:37,625
- ( chuckles )

83
00:06:37,708 --> 00:06:39,291
SHE STILL LIVES,

84
00:06:39,375 --> 00:06:41,083
SO I HAVEN'T BEEN BETRAYED.

85
00:06:41,166 --> 00:06:43,125
SO LONG AS SHE EXISTS,

86
00:06:43,208 --> 00:06:44,958
I CAN MAINTAIN MYSELF.

87
00:06:45,041 --> 00:06:46,958
- I'M JEALOUS.

88
00:06:47,041 --> 00:06:49,625
- PERHAPS YOU'VE FORGOTTEN.

89
00:06:49,708 --> 00:06:53,958
THIS MESS, IT'S ENTIRELY DUE TO
YOUR RECKLESS STUPIDITY, SIR.

90
00:06:54,041 --> 00:06:55,958
IT WAS VINCENT LAW.

91
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:57,625
THAT IMMIGRANT
SHE WAS AFTER 

92
00:06:57,708 --> 00:06:59,500
TURNED OUT TO BE
A PROXY.

93
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:04,625
AND THE REGENT WANTS THAT
POWER HARNESSED FOR ROMDEAU.

94
00:07:04,708 --> 00:07:06,416
IF YOU HADN'T CORNERED HIM,

95
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,250
IF YOU HAD BOTHERED
TO EXERCISE

96
00:07:08,333 --> 00:07:10,125
THE SLIGHTEST SELF-CONTROL,

97
00:07:10,208 --> 00:07:12,000
WHERE WOULD VINCENT LAW
BE RIGHT NOW?

98
00:07:12,083 --> 00:07:13,333
HE'D BE CONTAINED.

99
00:07:13,416 --> 00:07:15,500
YOU LET PERSONAL GRUDGES
GET IN THE WAY,

100
00:07:15,583 --> 00:07:17,166
AND YOU LOST THE PROXY.

101
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:19,583
WITHOUT YOU, EVERYTHING WOULD
STILL BE THE SAME.

102
00:07:19,666 --> 00:07:20,916
YOU RUINED EVERYTHING.

103
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,458
( grunts )

104
00:07:22,541 --> 00:07:24,583
- EVERYTHING?

105
00:07:24,666 --> 00:07:26,666
YOU THINK I RUINED EVERYTHING?!

106
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:28,375
- ( grunts )

107
00:07:28,458 --> 00:07:29,916
- IF YOU DON'T
WANT A BULLET 

108
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,833
THROUGH THAT
EXCEPTIONAL MIND OF YOURS,

109
00:07:31,916 --> 00:07:33,458
I'D WATCH YOUR MOUTH.

110
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,500
- HER TRANSPONDER WAS FINE
LAST TIME I CHECKED.

111
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:40,250
SHE JUST VANISHED.

112
00:07:40,333 --> 00:07:43,250
- VANISHED?
WHAT DO WE DO?

113
00:07:43,333 --> 00:07:46,000
- Re-L: THE ACTIONS OF
COGITO INFECTED AUTOREIVS

114
00:07:46,083 --> 00:07:48,333
ARE GOVERNED
BY THEIR EMOTIONS,

115
00:07:48,416 --> 00:07:51,416
THEIR SOULS.

116
00:07:56,625 --> 00:08:00,000
- Kristeva: THIS IS YOUR
FIFTH INSPECTION THIS MONTH.

117
00:08:00,083 --> 00:08:01,708
- AS CHIEF OF SECURITY,

118
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:03,375
IT'S MY DUTY TO BE
WELL-VERSED

119
00:08:03,458 --> 00:08:05,750
ON ALL ASPECTS OF
THE CITY'S DEFENSE SYSTEMS.

120
00:08:05,833 --> 00:08:07,708
- BUT THE RAPTURE
IS A RELIC.

121
00:08:07,791 --> 00:08:10,000
IT'S BEEN SEALED OFF.

122
00:08:10,083 --> 00:08:13,416
- YES, IT HAS.
HENCE MY INTEREST.

123
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:21,041
- THIS IS RIDICULOUS.

124
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:22,708
HOW DO YOU LOSE
AN AUTOREIV?

125
00:08:22,791 --> 00:08:25,375
AND WHY NOW WHEN
WE'RE SO CLOSE? 

126
00:08:25,458 --> 00:08:27,875
- WE COULD JUST LEAVE HER.
- WHAT?

127
00:08:27,958 --> 00:08:29,500
- SHE'S A COMPANION TYPE.

128
00:08:29,583 --> 00:08:31,875
ASIDE FROM HER SENSORS,
PINO'S USELESS.

129
00:08:31,958 --> 00:08:33,583
SHE'D BE FINE
IF WE LEFT HER.

130
00:08:33,666 --> 00:08:36,416
HONESTLY, IT MIGHT SAVE HER
FROM GETTING IN THE WAY.

131
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,250
- NO.
SHE'S ONE OF US.

132
00:08:38,333 --> 00:08:40,416
WE CAN'T JUST WRITE HER
OFF LIKE THAT.

133
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,083
SHE'S THE ONLY ONE
WHO STUCK WITH ME 

134
00:08:42,166 --> 00:08:43,750
THROUGH THIS WHOLE MESS.

135
00:08:43,833 --> 00:08:46,000
- I FEEL THE SAME.
- ( gasps )

136
00:08:48,666 --> 00:08:49,958
- DON'T JUST STAND THERE.

137
00:08:50,041 --> 00:08:51,416
LESS TALKING,
MORE LOOKING.

138
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:52,916
- RIGHT.

139
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,250
( grunts )

140
00:08:56,833 --> 00:08:57,791
OW.

141
00:08:57,875 --> 00:08:59,375
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

142
00:08:59,458 --> 00:09:01,166
- ( both gasp )

143
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:24,000
- WINNER.

144
00:09:31,333 --> 00:09:33,791
I COULD DO IT.

145
00:09:33,875 --> 00:09:35,583
I COULD TAKE THIS
LITTLE WORLD

146
00:09:35,666 --> 00:09:38,458
AND DROWN IT IN DESPAIR.

147
00:09:38,541 --> 00:09:39,875
( sighs )

148
00:09:45,875 --> 00:09:47,916
VINCENT LAW?

149
00:09:53,833 --> 00:09:55,958
STOP THAT!

150
00:09:59,916 --> 00:10:01,291
- Kristeva:
CHIEF?

151
00:10:01,375 --> 00:10:04,833
IT'S TIME.

152
00:10:04,916 --> 00:10:06,625
- YES.

153
00:10:06,708 --> 00:10:07,708
THANK YOU.

154
00:10:10,083 --> 00:10:12,958
- IS IT DEAD?

155
00:10:13,041 --> 00:10:14,500
- YEAH.

156
00:10:14,583 --> 00:10:16,833
AND THERE'S MORE
THAN ONE.

157
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:19,708
I'VE NEVER SEEN CREATURES
LIKE THESE BEFORE.

158
00:10:23,916 --> 00:10:25,500
- RE-L?
- SHH.

159
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:28,541
DO YOU HEAR THAT?

160
00:10:28,625 --> 00:10:29,875
- HUH?

161
00:10:34,083 --> 00:10:38,041
- WHAT'S THE MATTER?
YOU LOOK WORRIED.

162
00:10:38,125 --> 00:10:40,541
OH, THIS?  IT'S FINE.

163
00:10:40,625 --> 00:10:42,708
THAT'S SWEET
OF YOU TO SAY.

164
00:10:44,291 --> 00:10:45,500
THANK YOU.

165
00:10:48,291 --> 00:10:49,208
- ( piano playing )

166
00:10:55,625 --> 00:10:57,166
- ( gasps )

167
00:11:05,291 --> 00:11:07,583
PINO!
- ( giggles )

168
00:11:07,666 --> 00:11:11,291
VINCE!  RE-L.

169
00:11:12,625 --> 00:11:14,541
I'M GOOD AT THE PIANO, RIGHT?

170
00:11:14,625 --> 00:11:16,750
- WHERE ARE WE?

171
00:11:16,833 --> 00:11:19,125
AND WHO--

172
00:11:19,208 --> 00:11:21,833
WHAT IS THAT?

173
00:11:25,208 --> 00:11:27,500
YOU DON'T SEEM TO BE
HAVING A REACTION TO IT,

174
00:11:27,583 --> 00:11:31,083
SO IT'S PROBABLY NOT
ANOTHER PROXY.

175
00:11:31,166 --> 00:11:34,375
AND IT DOESN'T
SEEM TO BE REACTING

176
00:11:34,458 --> 00:11:36,916
TO WHAT WE'RE SAYING.

177
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,583
BUT LOOK AT THIS PLACE.

178
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:41,958
WHY DOES IT HAVE A PIANO?

179
00:11:44,708 --> 00:11:46,250
- Raul:
I'VE BEEN THINKING,

180
00:11:46,333 --> 00:11:49,541
MEDITATING ON THE NATURE
OF ROMDEAU.

181
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,916
WE'RE TRULY PRISONERS
MORE THAN CITIZENS.

182
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,250
- Derrida: WHAT DO YOU MEAN
BY "PRISONERS"?

183
00:11:57,333 --> 00:11:59,791
- ROMDEAU IS A SAFE HARBOR
FOR MANKIND

184
00:11:59,875 --> 00:12:02,291
AS THE OUTSIDE WORLD
RECOVERS.

185
00:12:02,375 --> 00:12:04,958
WE CANNOT SURVIVE
OUTSIDE THE CITY WALLS.

186
00:12:05,041 --> 00:12:06,625
- Berkeley: YES, OF COURSE.

187
00:12:06,708 --> 00:12:08,416
- Lacan:
IT IS THE SEED OF HUMANITY

188
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,625
WAITING TO TAKE ROOT
ONCE AGAIN.

189
00:12:10,708 --> 00:12:11,750
- SO...

190
00:12:11,833 --> 00:12:13,208
THEN WHAT YOU ARE SAYING

191
00:12:13,291 --> 00:12:15,291
IS THAT WE ARE
HELD PRISONER HERE.

192
00:12:15,375 --> 00:12:18,208
- Derrida: IS THAT WHY
YOU'VE COME TO US, RAUL?

193
00:12:18,291 --> 00:12:21,458
- Berkeley:
JUST TO SPOUT SUCH NONSENSE?

194
00:12:21,541 --> 00:12:23,125
- Lacan:
CEASE THIS PRATTLING.

195
00:12:23,208 --> 00:12:25,291
YOU ARE TO RETURN
TO YOUR DUTIES

196
00:12:25,375 --> 00:12:26,416
AS SECURITY CHIEF.

197
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:29,291
- AND HOW DO I
PROTECT US?

198
00:12:29,375 --> 00:12:31,458
TELL ME WHAT I'M
SUPPOSED TO DO. 

199
00:12:31,541 --> 00:12:33,083
- Derrida:
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

200
00:12:33,166 --> 00:12:36,291
- THE OUTSIDE WORLD
HAS BEGUN TO RECOVER.

201
00:12:36,375 --> 00:12:39,291
BUT WHY DOES IT STILL
REMAIN A WORLD OF DEATH TO US?

202
00:12:39,375 --> 00:12:41,333
TELL ME!

203
00:12:41,416 --> 00:12:44,666
- Derrida: DID DAEDALUS PUT
THESE IDEAS IN YOUR HEAD?

204
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:46,333
- ANSWER ME.

205
00:12:46,416 --> 00:12:48,666
- Berkeley: DO NOT THINK
YOU KNOW EVERYTHING.

206
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:51,458
DO NOT THINK YOU MAY
CHANGE EVERYTHING.

207
00:12:51,541 --> 00:12:53,708
- BUT I KNOW THE TRUTH.

208
00:12:53,791 --> 00:12:56,375
I KNOW THAT WE ARE
INCOMPLETE CREATURES.

209
00:12:56,458 --> 00:12:57,833
- Lacan:
SUCH FOOLISHNESS.

210
00:12:57,916 --> 00:13:01,458
- THE TRUTH IS THAT YOU'VE
BEEN WORKING IN IGNORANCE 

211
00:13:01,541 --> 00:13:02,833
FROM THE VERY START.

212
00:13:02,916 --> 00:13:06,333
- Berkeley:
RAUL, WATCH YOUR TONGUE.

213
00:13:06,416 --> 00:13:09,666
- THEN TELL ME WHAT I'VE 
BEEN DOING ALL THIS TIME.

214
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:11,041
- Proxy One: RAUL.

215
00:13:16,375 --> 00:13:19,458
COULD YOU AT LEAST
TRY AND PRETEND

216
00:13:19,541 --> 00:13:21,583
TO KNOW YOUR PLACE?

217
00:13:21,666 --> 00:13:23,958
SHOW SOME MODESTY,

218
00:13:24,041 --> 00:13:26,500
YOU SAD, PATHETIC
LITTLE ANIMAL.

219
00:13:26,583 --> 00:13:29,375
YOU ARE POWERLESS.

220
00:13:29,458 --> 00:13:32,125
- YOU THINK YOU'VE WON?

221
00:13:32,208 --> 00:13:34,333
I WON'T ALLOW IT.

222
00:13:36,125 --> 00:13:37,000
NEVER.

223
00:13:42,125 --> 00:13:45,666
YOU ARE NOTHING MORE
THAN A COG IN THE MACHINE.

224
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:47,958
A GREAT DESPAIR IS
MOVING AMONG US

225
00:13:48,041 --> 00:13:49,541
AND YOU REFUSE
TO DO ANYTHING

226
00:13:49,625 --> 00:13:52,208
WHILE MANKIND MARCHES
TOWARDS ITS DESTRUCTION.

227
00:13:52,291 --> 00:13:53,625
I'VE HAD ENOUGH!

228
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:56,041
ROMDEAU IS NOT YOUR EPITAPH!

229
00:13:56,125 --> 00:13:59,375
THE FUTURE OF OUR FELLOW
CITIZENS IS AT STAKE.

230
00:13:59,458 --> 00:14:02,291
WE CAN NO LONGER
AFFORD YOUR IGNORANCE.

231
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:04,125
GO TO HELL, REGENT.

232
00:14:17,833 --> 00:14:20,083
- Derrida: KRISTEVA.

233
00:14:20,166 --> 00:14:21,416
- MA'AM?

234
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:22,875
- Derrida: WE'RE PUTTING
YOU IN CHARGE

235
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:25,083
UNTIL A NEW CHIEF
IS APPOINTED.

236
00:14:25,166 --> 00:14:29,416
- Lacan: CITIZEN NUMBER 039666,
RAUL CREED,

237
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,791
IS TO BE STRIPPED
OF HIS AUTHORITY.

238
00:14:31,875 --> 00:14:34,750
- Berkeley:
IT ISN'T REALLY SURPRISING.

239
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:37,750
- Derrida: NO ONE APPOINTED AS
CHIEF OF THE SECURITY BUREAU

240
00:14:37,833 --> 00:14:40,625
HAS EVER SUCCESSFULLY
COMPLETED THEIR TERM.

241
00:14:40,708 --> 00:14:42,416
- Lacan: THEIR POSITION
TEACHES THEM THINGS

242
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:43,791
THEY SHOULD NOT KNOW.

243
00:14:43,875 --> 00:14:46,458
THESE IDEAS FOSTER
FEELINGS THEY SHOULD NOT FEEL.

244
00:14:46,541 --> 00:14:49,250
- Derrida: THEN THEY ALL
STRAY DOWN THIS PATH.

245
00:14:49,333 --> 00:14:50,625
- Berkeley:
WE KNEW IT WAS INEVITABLE

246
00:14:50,708 --> 00:14:53,000
FROM THE MOMENT
HE ASSUMED OFFICE.

247
00:14:54,583 --> 00:14:58,458
THIS IS WHAT BECOMES OF
A TRUE FELLOW CITIZEN, 

248
00:14:58,541 --> 00:15:00,541
AN IRONY WORTH NOTING.

249
00:15:02,541 --> 00:15:04,416
- ( gasping )

250
00:15:11,833 --> 00:15:15,291
- IS THIS WHERE THEY LIVE?

251
00:15:21,208 --> 00:15:23,125
- THEY SEEM AWFULLY WEAK.

252
00:15:23,208 --> 00:15:24,791
- ( Re-L coughing )

253
00:15:24,875 --> 00:15:25,958
- RE-L.

254
00:15:26,041 --> 00:15:30,125
- THERE ARE TRACES OF
TOXIC GAS IN HERE.

255
00:15:30,208 --> 00:15:32,750
- HUH?

256
00:15:32,833 --> 00:15:34,666
- NO WONDER THEY'RE
ALL SO WEAK.

257
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:36,833
THIS PLACE IS
A TOXIC DUMP.

258
00:15:36,916 --> 00:15:38,500
IT WAS BETTER OUTSIDE.

259
00:15:38,583 --> 00:15:39,875
( coughs )

260
00:15:39,958 --> 00:15:41,833
- ARE YOU GONNA
BE ALL RIGHT?

261
00:15:41,916 --> 00:15:44,625
- YEAH.
( coughing )

262
00:15:44,708 --> 00:15:46,958
- COME ON.
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.

263
00:15:47,041 --> 00:15:48,458
- ( Re-L coughing )

264
00:15:51,833 --> 00:15:54,833
- ( playing piano )
- ( humming )

265
00:15:54,916 --> 00:15:57,125
- PINO, LET'S GO.

266
00:15:57,208 --> 00:15:59,166
- AWW, JUST ONE MORE SONG?

267
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:00,875
- PINO!

268
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:03,500
WE'RE GOING NOW,
WITH OR WITHOUT YOU.

269
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:05,583
- ( groans )

270
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,625
- PINO.

271
00:16:09,708 --> 00:16:12,541
- Re-L: THIS PLACE MUST HAVE
BEEN CREATED BY HUMANS...

272
00:16:12,625 --> 00:16:14,250
- Pino: BUT I WAS HAVING
FUN PLAYING PIANO.

273
00:16:14,333 --> 00:16:15,333
- Re-L:
...WHILE THEY WAITED

274
00:16:15,416 --> 00:16:16,916
FOR THE OUTSIDE
ENVIRONMENT TO IMPROVE,

275
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,208
THEY SUCCUMBED TO
THE POISON INSIDE THE CAVE.

276
00:16:20,291 --> 00:16:23,541
I'M GUESSING THOSE CREATURES
DON'T HAVE MUCH LONGER.

277
00:16:23,625 --> 00:16:25,916
- Pino: WAIT.

278
00:16:52,666 --> 00:16:55,208
- WHAT COULD HE
BE THINKING?

279
00:16:55,291 --> 00:16:59,250
EMOTIONAL AWAKENING REALLY DOES
LEAD TO SELF-DESTRUCTION.

280
00:16:59,333 --> 00:17:03,583
JUST AS THEY SAID.

281
00:17:03,666 --> 00:17:07,583
CITIZEN NUMBER 039666,
RAUL CREED,

282
00:17:07,666 --> 00:17:10,583
YOUR TIME IS UP.

283
00:17:10,666 --> 00:17:13,041
- Man:
WE'VE LOST THE TARGET.

284
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:24,416
- KRISTEVA?

285
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:25,583
- RUN A FACIAL PROFILE

286
00:17:25,666 --> 00:17:27,583
SPREADING ACROSS
THE ENTIRE AREA.

287
00:17:27,666 --> 00:17:28,541
- YES, MA'AM.

288
00:17:34,208 --> 00:17:35,625
NO MATCHES.

289
00:17:35,708 --> 00:17:38,125
SHALL I CHANGE
THE SEARCH HEADING PARAMETERS?

290
00:17:38,208 --> 00:17:40,291
- RECONFIRM OUR
LAST SIGHTING, 

291
00:17:40,375 --> 00:17:43,250
THEN RECONSTRUCT
THE PROJECTED ESCAPE ROUTE FILE.

292
00:17:45,708 --> 00:17:49,291
HE WAS A VERY CLEVER
SECURITY CHIEF.

293
00:17:49,375 --> 00:17:51,291
ALWAYS ONE STEP AHEAD OF US.

294
00:17:54,375 --> 00:17:56,583
WHERE WOULD HIS DESPAIR
BRING HIM?

295
00:17:59,041 --> 00:18:02,000
- YES, IT HAS.
HENCE MY INTEREST.

296
00:18:02,083 --> 00:18:03,500
- I KNOW WHERE HE'S HEADED.

297
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:13,041
BEGIN DELETION OF CITIZEN
NUMBER 039666, RAUL CREED,

298
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:14,458
FROM THE SYSTEM.

299
00:18:14,541 --> 00:18:15,541
- CONFIRMED.

300
00:18:15,625 --> 00:18:18,000
HIS DATA WILL BE
COMPLETELY DELETED IN...

301
00:18:18,083 --> 00:18:20,333
- ( panting )

302
00:18:20,416 --> 00:18:22,958
- ...14 MINUTES, 55 SECONDS.

LAST CONFIRMED SIGHTING

THROUGH DISTRICTS
E AND H.

305
00:18:31,583 --> 00:18:33,666
- Kristeva: CONFIRMED.

306
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:35,458
OVERWRITE YOUR PROJECTED
ESCAPE ROUTES FILE

307
00:18:35,541 --> 00:18:37,041
WITH THE UPDATED
VERSION AVAILABLE

308
00:18:37,125 --> 00:18:38,666
ON THE SECURITY NETWORK.

309
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:42,333
REMEMBER THAT THE TARGET IS
A FORMER SECURITY BUREAU CHIEF.

310
00:18:42,416 --> 00:18:43,583
- Man: YES, MA'AM.

311
00:18:43,666 --> 00:18:45,041
- SEND AN ARMED
AUTOREIV UNIT

312
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:47,000
TO THE RAPTURE CONTROL FACILITY.

313
00:18:47,083 --> 00:18:48,500
WE CAN PIN HIM DOWN THERE.

314
00:18:48,583 --> 00:18:50,625
- YES, MA'AM.

315
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,291
- WELL, I WONDER WHAT
OUR FORMER CHIEF WILL DO.

316
00:18:55,375 --> 00:18:57,208
EITHER WAY,

317
00:18:57,291 --> 00:19:00,208
IT DOESN'T REALLY AFFECT ME.

318
00:19:03,625 --> 00:19:07,708
HE MAY HAVE BEEN TOO EMOTIONAL
TO BE A FELLOW CITIZEN.

319
00:19:07,791 --> 00:19:09,916
BUT HE WAS AN
ENDEARING IDIOT.

320
00:19:11,916 --> 00:19:13,416
IS THAT CRUEL OF ME?

321
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:15,041
- NO.

322
00:19:15,125 --> 00:19:17,375
YOU ARE THE PRINCE OF ROMDEAU.

323
00:19:17,458 --> 00:19:19,708
- DON'T CALL ME PRINCE.

324
00:19:19,791 --> 00:19:21,375
IT'D MAKE HER LAUGH.

325
00:19:21,458 --> 00:19:23,666
- MODIFYING APPLICATION
SETTING CONFIRMED.

326
00:19:25,458 --> 00:19:27,666
- I'LL ALWAYS
BE ON YOUR SIDE.

327
00:19:29,791 --> 00:19:32,041
- Pino: ARE WE CLOSE TO
THE RABBIT YET?

328
00:19:32,125 --> 00:19:33,958
MY BATTERY IS RUNNING OUT.
- Re-L: STRANGE.

329
00:19:34,041 --> 00:19:37,083
THE POISON SHOULD BE
THINNING OUT THE FURTHER WE GO.

330
00:19:37,166 --> 00:19:39,083
- Pino: VINCE!

331
00:19:39,166 --> 00:19:41,041
- I KNOW, I KNOW.

332
00:19:47,166 --> 00:19:49,125
- Reporter: THREE AUTOREIVS
WERE FOUND DESTROYED

333
00:19:49,208 --> 00:19:51,750
IN THE E AND H DISTRICTS
LEADING TOWARDS RAPTURE.

334
00:19:51,833 --> 00:19:54,750
FORMER BUREAU CHIEF RAUL'S
I.D. WAS FOUND AT THE SCENE.

335
00:19:54,833 --> 00:19:56,041
- IDIOT.

336
00:19:58,833 --> 00:20:03,083
RAUL CREED'S CITIZENSHIP WILL
BE REVOKED IN EIGHT MINUTES.

337
00:20:03,166 --> 00:20:06,083
IN THE MEANTIME, HIS AUTHORITY
AS CHIEF OF SECURITY

338
00:20:06,166 --> 00:20:07,458
IS STILL IN PLAY.

339
00:20:07,541 --> 00:20:10,583
TAKE HIM INTO CUSTODY
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. 

340
00:20:10,666 --> 00:20:12,708
- ( groans )

341
00:20:14,958 --> 00:20:16,416
- ( grunts )

342
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:17,750
PINO, STOP.

343
00:20:17,833 --> 00:20:19,125
THAT HURTS.

344
00:20:19,208 --> 00:20:20,083
- IT'S HIM.

345
00:20:26,208 --> 00:20:27,458
ARE YOU OKAY?

346
00:20:27,541 --> 00:20:30,125
- I KNEW IT.
- HUH?

347
00:20:30,208 --> 00:20:33,458
- THEY CAN'T SURVIVE IN
THE ATMOSPHERE OUTSIDE.

348
00:20:33,541 --> 00:20:35,916
EVEN THOUGH THE POISON 
IS SLOWLY KILLING THEM,

349
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,291
THEY CAN'T LEAVE THE CAVES.

350
00:20:37,375 --> 00:20:38,833
- YOU MEAN NO MATTER
WHAT THEY DO,

351
00:20:38,916 --> 00:20:40,791
THEY'RE GOING TO DIE?

352
00:20:40,875 --> 00:20:43,416
- IT SEEMS A FEW DON'T
ACCEPT THEIR FATE.

353
00:20:45,875 --> 00:20:47,375
- HE FOLLOWED US
OUT HERE.

354
00:20:47,458 --> 00:20:49,166
RIGHT, VINCE?

355
00:20:56,875 --> 00:20:58,083
- ( sighs )

356
00:21:08,583 --> 00:21:09,625
- ( groans )

357
00:21:09,708 --> 00:21:11,166
- ( gasps )

358
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:13,000
OH.

359
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:21,166
THAT'S GOOD, RIGHT?

360
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:22,125
- Vincent: YEAH.

361
00:21:27,958 --> 00:21:30,166
- BYE-BYE.
YOU'RE WITH YOUR DADDY NOW.

362
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:31,333
- THAT'S, UH...

363
00:21:31,416 --> 00:21:33,500
THAT'S NOT HER DADDY.

364
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:36,333
- HUH?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

365
00:21:36,416 --> 00:21:38,208
- NOT AGAIN.

366
00:21:39,958 --> 00:21:41,208
- IT CAN'T BE.

367
00:21:58,958 --> 00:22:01,500
- RAUL CREED,
STOP THIS IMMEDIATELY.

368
00:22:08,791 --> 00:22:10,208
- ALL CLEAR.

369
00:22:10,291 --> 00:22:12,000
HE'LL BE DELETED
FROM THE SYSTEM 

370
00:22:12,083 --> 00:22:13,458
IN 20 SECONDS.

371
00:22:13,541 --> 00:22:15,541
- DID I OVERESTIMATE HIM?

372
00:22:15,625 --> 00:22:17,208
NO.

373
00:22:17,291 --> 00:22:18,375
- Man:
WE'VE LOCATED THE TARGET.

374
00:22:18,458 --> 00:22:19,875
- WHERE IS HE?

375
00:22:19,958 --> 00:22:20,916
- Man:
AT HIS RESIDENCE.

376
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,916
- HE IS?

377
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,625
WHAT ARE YOU UP TO?

378
00:22:25,708 --> 00:22:27,166
- FIVE SECONDS TILL DELETION.

379
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:29,416
THREE...

380
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:30,500
TWO...

381
00:22:30,583 --> 00:22:32,208
- CANCEL THE DELETION.
- ...ONE, ZERO.

382
00:22:45,041 --> 00:22:48,500
IT'S NOT RECOGNIZING
THE FIRING SEQUENCE ABORT CODE.

383
00:22:48,583 --> 00:22:50,166
- ( piano playing )

384
00:22:52,333 --> 00:22:55,583
- REBOOT ALL CONTROL SYSTEMS
FOR THIS FACILITY.

385
00:22:55,666 --> 00:22:57,583
- "COMMAND NOT RECOGNIZED."

386
00:22:57,666 --> 00:23:00,291
THERE'S NO WAY TO
STOP THE LAUNCH. 

387
00:23:04,666 --> 00:23:07,291
- HIS DELETION HAS TRIGGERED
THE SYSTEM LOCKOUT.

388
00:23:07,375 --> 00:23:09,250
WELL PLAYED, RAUL CREED.

389
00:23:26,708 --> 00:23:28,791
- NOTHING BUT DESPAIR.

390
00:23:30,208 --> 00:23:32,125
I CAN NO LONGER
RESIST THE FEELINGS

391
00:23:32,208 --> 00:23:33,833
THAT DRIVE ME TO DESTROY.

392
00:23:35,416 --> 00:23:36,500
IT WAS ALWAYS HIM.

393
00:23:37,875 --> 00:23:39,083
HE STOLE THE LIGHT

394
00:23:39,166 --> 00:23:40,875
FROM THIS GREAT CIVILIZATION.

395
00:23:40,958 --> 00:23:45,125
HE STOLE THE DESTRUCTION
MY DESPAIR HUNGERED FOR.

396
00:23:45,208 --> 00:23:48,541
HE STOLE EVERYTHING FROM ME.

397
00:23:51,416 --> 00:23:52,375
PINO...

398
00:24:07,083 --> 00:24:09,250
- Vincent:
YOU REALLY LIKE TO PLAY.

399
00:24:09,333 --> 00:24:10,791
- YEAH.

400
00:24:10,875 --> 00:24:12,041
I LOVE IT.

401
00:24:23,333 --> 00:24:24,458
- WHAT?

402
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:27,958
- Pino:
WOW, IT'S SO PRETTY.

403
00:24:33,791 --> 00:24:35,666

A MAN AND WOMAN
COME FACE-TO-FACE
