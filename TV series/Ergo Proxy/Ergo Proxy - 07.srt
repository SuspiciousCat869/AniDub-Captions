2
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:49,875
- WHOA.

3
00:00:56,875 --> 00:00:58,750
WHOA.

4
00:00:59,875 --> 00:01:01,583
WHOA.

5
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:08,083
THANKS A LOT, VINCE.

6
00:01:15,541 --> 00:01:17,625
- ( Vincent's voice )
HAVING BEEN DRIVEN FROM ROMDEAU

7
00:01:17,708 --> 00:01:19,916
BY A MONSTER
CALLED THE PROXY,

8
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,291
I BEGAN MY JOURNEY
INTO THE OUTSIDE WORLD.

9
00:01:25,541 --> 00:01:27,208
- ( playing harmonica )

10
00:01:27,291 --> 00:01:30,250
- LOSING ALL ELSE,
I'M LEFT WITH ONLY MY DOUBTS

11
00:01:30,333 --> 00:01:33,291
AND A SINGLE PATH
STILL OPEN TO ME.

12
00:01:33,375 --> 00:01:36,500
SO WE TRAVEL TO MOSK,
MY BIRTHPLACE,

13
00:01:36,583 --> 00:01:38,833
IN THE HOPES
OF FINDING SOMETHING,

14
00:01:38,916 --> 00:01:40,833
ANYTHING.

15
00:01:40,916 --> 00:01:44,041
WE'VE BEEN TRAVELING
FOR SEVERAL DAYS NOW.

16
00:01:44,125 --> 00:01:47,833
OUR BODIES
HAVE GROWN WEAK.

17
00:01:47,916 --> 00:01:52,666
THE CLOUDED SKIES
HANG HEAVY ABOVE US.

18
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:56,833
FROZEN DESOLATION
THAT STRETCHES ON FOREVER

19
00:01:56,916 --> 00:01:59,500
TO THE ENDS
OF THE HORIZON.

20
00:01:59,583 --> 00:02:03,375
THE DISMAL VIEW
CLOSES IN AROUND US,

21
00:02:03,458 --> 00:02:07,333
CHILLING US TO THE BONE,

22
00:02:07,416 --> 00:02:09,666
CHILLING US
TO THE VERY SOUL.

36
00:04:00,458 --> 00:04:03,250
- Daedalus: FINE.  I KNOW
IT'S ONLY BEEN THREE DAYS,

37
00:04:03,333 --> 00:04:05,958
BUT ADAPTATION RATES
FOR THE BIOMIMETIC AMRITA CELLS

38
00:04:06,041 --> 00:04:07,958
SEEM TO BE PROGRESSING
FAVORABLY.

39
00:04:08,041 --> 00:04:10,541
WE'RE STILL WATCHING FOR ANY
COMPLICATIONS THAT MAY ARISE

40
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:13,083
DUE TO THE INFECTION
AND HER WEAKENED IMMUNE SYSTEM.

41
00:04:13,166 --> 00:04:15,125
SO FAR, THOUGH,
EVERYTHING IS LOOKING GOOD.

- Daedalus: BARRING
COMPLICATIONS,

44
00:04:24,583 --> 00:04:26,833
I THINK WE COULD BE
SENDING HER HOME FOR BED REST

45
00:04:26,916 --> 00:04:28,791
AS EARLY AS TODAY.

46
00:04:31,291 --> 00:04:33,708
IF YOU LIKE,
I WOULD BE HAPPY

47
00:04:33,791 --> 00:04:35,708
TO BRING HER BY LATER.

48
00:04:35,791 --> 00:04:37,666
- I HAVE THE LATEST DATA.

49
00:04:40,625 --> 00:04:43,291
- SHE'S ALMOST
COMPLETELY HEALED.

50
00:04:44,833 --> 00:04:48,500
YOU NEVER CEASE
TO AMAZE ME, RE-L.

51

- Husserl: THE PROXY
HAS VANISHED

53
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:15,000
FROM THE OUTSKIRTS
OF ROMDEAU.

54
00:05:15,083 --> 00:05:17,666
THIS FACT
IS IMMUTABLE.

- Kristeva: IF YOU ARE
IN POSSESSION

56
00:05:21,166 --> 00:05:23,708
OF ANY SOLID INFORMATION, WE ASK
THAT YOU PLEASE DISCLOSE--

57
00:05:23,791 --> 00:05:27,250
- Derrida: DON'T FORGET,
WHILE WE ARE INDIVIDUALS,

58
00:05:27,333 --> 00:05:30,041
WE ARE ALSO
A SINGLE ENTITY.

59
00:05:30,125 --> 00:05:32,041
- IT'S JUST THAT
IF THE RESEARCH BUREAU

60
00:05:32,125 --> 00:05:34,416
HAS DISCOVERED A SYSTEM
FOR TRACKING THE PROXY,

61
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,958
THEN THE SECURITY BUREAU
SHOULD--

62
00:05:37,041 --> 00:05:38,958
- Husserl: WE ARE WELL AWARE...

63
00:05:39,041 --> 00:05:42,041
- Lacan: OF THESE
INTER-BUREAU QUARRELS.

64
00:05:42,125 --> 00:05:44,500
WE ARE WELL AWARE

65
00:05:44,583 --> 00:05:48,125
OF THE ENTIRETY
OF ROMDEAU.

66
00:05:48,208 --> 00:05:50,125
- Berkeley: OUR WORDS ALONE

67
00:05:50,208 --> 00:05:52,125
SHOULD BE SUFFICIENT PROOF

68
00:05:52,208 --> 00:05:56,333
AS TO WHETHER THE PROXY
IS PRESENT OR NOT.

69
00:05:56,416 --> 00:06:00,083
- Husserl: THE PROXY
IS NOT IN ROMDEAU.

70
00:06:00,166 --> 00:06:03,416
THAT MUCH IS CERTAIN.

71
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:07,125
- FINE.  THEN LET ME ASK
A QUESTION OF THE WHOLE ENTITY:

72
00:06:07,208 --> 00:06:09,375
WHAT EXACTLY
IS THE REASONING

73
00:06:09,458 --> 00:06:12,541
BEHIND ALLOWING A CITIZEN TO
RETURN FROM THE OUTSIDE WORLD,

74
00:06:12,625 --> 00:06:15,625
WHEN IT HAS NEVER BEEN
ALLOWED BEFORE?

75
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:18,833
- Derrida: YOU ARE NOT
AUTHORIZED TO REQUEST DISCLOSURE

76
00:06:18,916 --> 00:06:21,625
OF INFORMATION RELATED
TO THAT MATTER.

77
00:06:21,708 --> 00:06:24,083
- Husserl: YOUR TIME IS UP.

78
00:07:04,708 --> 00:07:07,375
- ( Re-L's voice )
I THOUGHT KNOWING THE TRUTH

79
00:07:07,458 --> 00:07:09,750
WOULD MAKE ME HAPPY.

80
00:07:09,833 --> 00:07:12,458
I WAS SUCH A FOOL.

81
00:07:12,541 --> 00:07:15,125
I'M WEAK.

82
00:07:15,208 --> 00:07:18,833
MY CURIOSITY WOULD NOT
ALLOW ME TO BE HAPPY.

83
00:07:24,583 --> 00:07:27,291
ALL OF MY
GRANDFATHER'S LIES...

84
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:31,958
THERE'S A WORLD
OUTSIDE THIS CITY.

85
00:07:33,583 --> 00:07:36,958
THERE ARE PEOPLE
OUTSIDE THIS CITY.

86
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:41,666
I KNOW THAT NOW.

87
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:44,041
AND THERE IS NO ESCAPE

88
00:07:44,125 --> 00:07:46,625
FROM WHAT YOU KNOW.

89
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:01,541
WHAT'S THAT DOING HERE?

90
00:08:01,625 --> 00:08:05,333
DAEDALUS, SO YOU DID KNOW
AFTER ALL.

91
00:08:28,416 --> 00:08:30,333
- ( beeping )

92
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,875
- ( elevator stops )

93
00:09:05,166 --> 00:09:06,208
- ( gasps )

94
00:09:10,708 --> 00:09:13,041
- Daedalus: THEY'RE LIKE
CLOCKWORK WOMBS.

95
00:09:15,708 --> 00:09:17,208
- DAEDALUS.

96
00:09:17,291 --> 00:09:20,541
- THIS IS THE BIRTHPLACE
OF TRUE CITIZENS OF ROMDEAU--

97
00:09:20,625 --> 00:09:22,541
THE WOMBSYS.

98
00:09:22,625 --> 00:09:25,416
- DAEDALUS, TELL ME WHY.

99
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:28,625
- I'LL BE TAKING MY SCALPEL
BACK FROM YOU NOW.

100
00:09:28,708 --> 00:09:30,916
IF EVEN ONE OF THEM
GOES MISSING,

101
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,250
PEOPLE MIGHT START
TO ASK QUESTIONS.

102
00:09:34,375 --> 00:09:36,291
BY THE WAY, WELL DONE.

103
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:38,750
YOUR CURIOSITY
IS QUITE IMPRESSIVE.

104
00:09:41,666 --> 00:09:43,583
COME WITH ME.

105
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:45,541
I HAVE SOMETHING
TO SHOW YOU.

106
00:09:47,375 --> 00:09:49,916
FROM FUNCTION TO FORM,

107
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,833
THIS PRODUCTION LINE
IS FAR AND AWAY

108
00:09:51,916 --> 00:09:54,750
THE MOST EFFICIENT BIOLOGICAL
AND MECHANICAL SYSTEM

109
00:09:54,833 --> 00:09:56,750
THAT EXISTS
WITHIN THE DOME.

110
00:09:56,833 --> 00:09:59,083
IT IS FROM THIS PLACE
THAT THE FOUNDATIONS

111
00:09:59,166 --> 00:10:01,083
OF WHAT MAKES A GOOD
FELLOW CITIZEN

112
00:10:01,166 --> 00:10:03,041
ARE PREPARED.

113
00:10:04,166 --> 00:10:06,416
EVERY STEP CONTROLLED,

114
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:08,833
EVERY DETAIL SCRUTINIZED,

115
00:10:08,916 --> 00:10:11,208
ALL BALANCE MAINTAINED.

116
00:10:11,291 --> 00:10:13,625
POPULATION MANAGEMENT
AND SOCIAL STABILITY

117
00:10:13,708 --> 00:10:16,208
ARE ESSENTIAL FOR MAINTAINING
AN ORDERED DAILY LIFE

118
00:10:16,291 --> 00:10:18,208
WITHIN A CITY
LIKE ROMDEAU.

119
00:10:18,291 --> 00:10:19,500
RE-L?

120
00:10:19,583 --> 00:10:21,500
- I'M FINE.
IT'S JUST--

121
00:10:21,583 --> 00:10:24,125
I'VE ALWAYS KNOWN
THAT PEOPLE WERE GROWN IN TUBES.

122
00:10:24,208 --> 00:10:27,875
I'VE KNOWN ABOUT IT AND
I'VE ACCEPTED IT MY ENTIRE LIFE,

123
00:10:27,958 --> 00:10:31,333
BUT-- BUT THE REALITY
OF IT IS--

124
00:10:31,416 --> 00:10:33,708
- SEEING IT
CAN BE DISTURBING.

125
00:10:36,416 --> 00:10:41,208
OPERATIONAL INTERVENTION
IN EARLY DEVELOPMENT--

126
00:10:41,291 --> 00:10:43,291
ONLY BY OUR CONSTANT
INTERVENTION

127
00:10:43,375 --> 00:10:45,916
DOES THE HUMAN RACE
CONTINUE.

128
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,333
- ARE YOU SO SURE?

129
00:10:48,416 --> 00:10:49,833
ARE YOU?

130
00:10:49,916 --> 00:10:52,875
THEN HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN
THE WORLD I SAW OUTSIDE?

131
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:55,541
DAEDALUS, CAN YOU
JUST TELL ME,

132
00:10:55,625 --> 00:10:58,291
IF THERE IS A VIABLE LIVING
WORLD OUTSIDE THESE WALLS,

133
00:10:58,375 --> 00:11:01,041
THEN WHY DO THE CITIZENS
NEED THE DOME ANYMORE?

134
00:11:01,125 --> 00:11:04,166
HASN'T ITS USEFULNESS
FINALLY COME TO AN END?

135
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:06,500
WHY KEEP IT A SECRET?

136
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,916
- I'M AN IDIOT.

137
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,875
I CAME VERY CLOSE TO LOSING
SOMEONE IMPORTANT TO ME.

138
00:11:16,291 --> 00:11:17,750
I'M SORRY.

139
00:11:17,833 --> 00:11:20,375
I NEVER SHOULD HAVE
LET YOU GO OUTSIDE.

140
00:11:20,458 --> 00:11:22,375
- IT'S TOO LATE NOW.

141
00:11:22,458 --> 00:11:25,708
ONCE YOU KNOW THE TRUTH, THERE'S
NO ESCAPING IT EVER AGAIN.

142
00:11:25,791 --> 00:11:27,375
- YES.

143
00:11:27,458 --> 00:11:30,250
- YOU STILL REMEMBER
OUR PROMISE?

144
00:11:30,333 --> 00:11:31,750
- YES.

145
00:11:31,833 --> 00:11:34,500
BUT, FIRST OFF,

146
00:11:34,583 --> 00:11:37,041
I NEED YOU TO HELP ME
SAVE FACE.

147
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:40,541
- I NEED TO SEE
MY GRANDFATHER.

148
00:11:42,083 --> 00:11:44,000
- ( Re-L's voice )
HE'S RIGHT.

149
00:11:44,083 --> 00:11:46,000
BEFORE I SET OUT
ON ANY JOURNEY,

150
00:11:46,083 --> 00:11:48,000
THERE'S SOMEONE
I NEED TO SEE.

151
00:11:56,333 --> 00:11:59,625
- ( Vincent's voice )
A WORLD WITHOUT A TRACE OF LIFE,

152
00:11:59,708 --> 00:12:01,958
WITHOUT THE SLIGHTEST SCAR

153
00:12:02,041 --> 00:12:05,625
OF HUMAN CIVILIZATION,

154
00:12:05,708 --> 00:12:07,916
FAR FROM MOSK,

155
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,333
OUR HOPEFUL
FINAL DESTINATION.

156
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:20,041
AND PAINTED
ON EVERY FACE,

157
00:12:20,125 --> 00:12:22,375
A PALLOR OF FATIGUE.

158
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,208
- GRANDFATHER, I'M SORRY
I'VE CAUSED SO MUCH TROUBLE.

159
00:12:38,375 --> 00:12:41,750
- Lacan: RE-L, ARE YOU
FINALLY SATISFIED?

00:12:44,708 --> 00:12:46,791
- Lacan: IT'S ALL RIGHT.

162
00:12:46,875 --> 00:12:49,333
YOU CAN SPEAK FREELY HERE.

163
00:12:49,416 --> 00:12:53,083
- Husserl: WE WOULD HAVE YOU
SPEAK NOW.

164
00:12:53,166 --> 00:12:55,083
- THERE WERE PEOPLE
OUT THERE,

165
00:12:55,166 --> 00:12:57,541
REAL LIVING PEOPLE,

166
00:12:57,625 --> 00:13:00,000
A WHOLE WORLD.

167
00:13:00,083 --> 00:13:02,041
- Derrida: REALLY?

168
00:13:02,125 --> 00:13:04,333
- WHY DO YOU HIDE
WHAT'S OUT THERE?

169
00:13:04,416 --> 00:13:05,833
- Lacan: RE-L--

170
00:13:05,916 --> 00:13:07,833
- WHAT ARE YOU SO AFRAID OF
OUT THERE?

171
00:13:07,916 --> 00:13:09,666
- Husserl: YOU'VE SAID
QUITE ENOUGH.

172
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:11,458
- I'M TALKING
TO MY GRANDFATHER.

173
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:20,791
- ( Re-L's voice )
YOU WON'T ANSWER, WILL YOU?

174
00:13:25,458 --> 00:13:27,916
- ( wind whistling )

175
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
- - ( Vincent's voice )
I WONDER HOW LONG IT'S BEEN

176
00:13:30,083 --> 00:13:32,375
SINCE WE LEFT ROMDEAU.

177
00:13:34,041 --> 00:13:36,458
EVERYONE LOOKS SO TIRED.

178
00:13:36,541 --> 00:13:38,875
WE MOVE ON,

179
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:41,875
LEAVING ONE MORE MAN

180
00:13:41,958 --> 00:13:44,166
SLEEPING IN THE DIRT.

181
00:14:13,166 --> 00:14:14,666
- RE-L.

182
00:14:24,583 --> 00:14:27,333
- RE-L!  RE-L!

183
00:14:27,416 --> 00:14:29,750
- HE WAS SENT TO ME
FOR READJUSTMENT,

184
00:14:29,833 --> 00:14:32,250
DUE TO INACCURATE
JUDGMENT VALUATIONS.

185
00:14:32,333 --> 00:14:34,875
AND SO I PUT HIM HERE
FOR SAFEKEEPING.

186
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:36,875
I'LL GO SET THINGS UP.

187
00:14:36,958 --> 00:14:38,000
- ( door opens )

188
00:14:44,375 --> 00:14:47,958
- IF IT WASN'T FOR THE PRINCE,
I'D BE SCRAP BY NOW.

189
00:14:48,041 --> 00:14:50,625
YOU'VE LOST SOME WEIGHT,
HAVEN'T YOU?

190
00:14:50,708 --> 00:14:53,041
YOU LOOK PALE TOO.

191
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:56,583
YOU'RE A MESS WITHOUT ME,
AREN'T YOU, RE-L?

192
00:14:56,666 --> 00:14:58,708
HEY, COME ON, RE-L.

193
00:14:58,791 --> 00:15:00,625
WHY WON'T YOU
TALK TO ME?

194
00:15:00,708 --> 00:15:03,625
- ( Re-L's voice )
BECAUSE EVEN NOW YOU'RE BEING--

195
00:15:03,708 --> 00:15:06,291
- GOOD.

196
00:15:06,375 --> 00:15:09,166
NOW IT'S MY TURN
TO KEEP MY PROMISE TO YOU.

197
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:12,000
- HOLD ON.
BEFORE THAT...

198
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:20,000
- OH, THAT'S RIGHT.
I DIDN'T TELL YOU--

199
00:15:20,083 --> 00:15:22,000
IGGY'S BEEN GIVEN

200
00:15:22,083 --> 00:15:24,333
THE SAME PROCEDURE
AS MY ASSISTANTS.

201
00:15:24,416 --> 00:15:27,791
- YOU CUT OFF HIS CONNECTION
TO THE SURVEILLANCE STRUCTURE?

202
00:15:27,875 --> 00:15:30,166
- YES.

203
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:32,166
TAKE COMFORT
THAT IGGY'S EARS

204
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:34,541
NO LONGER BELONG
TO YOUR GRANDFATHER.

205
00:15:34,625 --> 00:15:37,958
- SO I CAN SPEAK FREELY
ABOUT THE SECURITY BUREAU?

206
00:15:38,041 --> 00:15:39,541
HMM.

207
00:15:39,625 --> 00:15:42,291
- ALL RIGHT,
LET'S GET DOWN TO BUSINESS.

208
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:47,458
SO I HAVE
THE AUTOPSY REPORT

209
00:15:47,541 --> 00:15:49,708
ON THAT THING OF YOURS
FROM A WHILE BACK--

210
00:15:49,791 --> 00:15:52,916
THE THING FROM DEEP INSIDE
THE OUTER BLOCK.

211
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,333
BUT BEFORE THAT,

212
00:15:55,416 --> 00:15:57,333
I'D BETTER TELL YOU
EVERYTHING

213
00:15:57,416 --> 00:15:59,291
RIGHT FROM THE BEGINNING.

214
00:16:07,208 --> 00:16:10,291
- Raul: THIS ERA
IS COMING TO AN END.

215
00:16:10,375 --> 00:16:12,333
- Kristeva: CHIEF?

216
00:16:12,416 --> 00:16:15,541
- IT HAS BECOME APPARENT TO ME
THAT THE REGENT'S LIFE FORCE

217
00:16:15,625 --> 00:16:19,041
IS GRADUALLY STARTING
TO DECLINE.

218
00:16:19,125 --> 00:16:22,083
IT IS MOST CLEARLY EVIDENT
IN HIS COMPLEXION.

219
00:16:22,166 --> 00:16:24,083
- I'M AN ENTOURAGE AUTOREIV,

220
00:16:24,166 --> 00:16:27,041
AND THEREFORE I MUST RECORD
SUCH STATEMENTS.

221
00:16:27,125 --> 00:16:29,000
- I WANT THEM
TO HEAR ME.

222
00:16:31,291 --> 00:16:33,875
ANY SIGNS OF THE PROXY?

223
00:16:33,958 --> 00:16:35,875
- NOW THAT IT'S NO LONGER
IN THE CITY,

224
00:16:35,958 --> 00:16:39,083
OUR REMOTE FOLLOW-UP SYSTEM
IS MAKING TRACKING DIFFICULT.

225
00:16:41,541 --> 00:16:43,875
- THEN LET'S SIMPLIFY.

226
00:16:43,958 --> 00:16:46,750
I WANT TO PULL THE RELICS FROM
THE SECRET UNDERGROUND VAULTS.

227
00:16:46,833 --> 00:16:49,333
- ( beeps )
- INTELLIGENCE RELEASE MODE

228
00:16:49,416 --> 00:16:51,458
CONFIRMED?
- YES.

229
00:16:51,541 --> 00:16:53,625
- YOU MEAN
THE LONG-RANGE CRAFTS

230
00:16:53,708 --> 00:16:56,291
THAT WERE USED
FOR THE MOSK OPERATION?

231
00:16:56,375 --> 00:16:58,458
- LET'S DWELL ON THE THOUGHT
OF THE DAY:

232
00:16:58,541 --> 00:17:00,625
IF YOU'RE GOING TO EAT
THE POISON,

233
00:17:00,708 --> 00:17:02,916
YOU MIGHT AS WELL
EAT THE PLATE.

234
00:17:04,291 --> 00:17:08,041
- Daedalus: WE CALLED IT
THE MONAD PROXY.

235
00:17:08,125 --> 00:17:10,416
- MONAD?

236
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,416
- IT WAS PLUNDERED

237
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,541
FROM THE MOSK DOME.

238
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:24,250
IT WAS ALREADY HERE

239
00:17:24,333 --> 00:17:27,708
WHEN I WAS FIRST ASSIGNED
TO THE FACILITY.

240
00:17:27,791 --> 00:17:30,166
I WASN'T TOLD
THE REASONS

241
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:33,416
AS TO WHY
IT WAS KEPT SHACKLED

242
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:37,125
OR THE REASONS WHY WE WERE
FORBIDDEN TO AWAKEN IT.

243
00:17:37,208 --> 00:17:39,833
BUT THERE ARE SOME THINGS
I DO KNOW.

244
00:17:39,916 --> 00:17:43,208
FIRST, IT IS
IN NO WAY A PERSON.

245
00:17:43,291 --> 00:17:45,208
FROM BOTH A THEOLOGICAL

246
00:17:45,291 --> 00:17:47,208
AS WELL AS A BIOLOGICAL
PERSPECTIVE,

247
00:17:47,291 --> 00:17:49,375
WE WERE UNABLE
TO IDENTIFY ANYTHING,

248
00:17:49,458 --> 00:17:51,833
EVEN DOWN TO GENDER.

249
00:17:51,916 --> 00:17:55,416
IN MY OPINION, AS FAR AS
ITS SIGNIFICANCE TO ROMDEAU,

250
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,666
THE PROXY SHOULD BE
THOUGHT OF AS--

251
00:17:57,750 --> 00:18:00,083
AS MORE OF
A LIFE FORCE.

252
00:18:00,166 --> 00:18:02,875
- SO IT'S NOT A MONSTER.

253
00:18:02,958 --> 00:18:07,750
- NO.  IN FACT, IT'S REALLY
MUCH MORE LIKE A GOD.

254
00:18:07,833 --> 00:18:10,666
IT'S THE KEY
TO SUPPORTING THE FIELD

255
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:14,750
NECESSARY FOR OUR SURVIVAL
ON THIS DEVASTATED WORLD.

256
00:18:17,416 --> 00:18:19,333
- IT SOUNDS
ALMOST LIKE MAGIC.

257
00:18:19,416 --> 00:18:21,500
- WE DO HAVE DATA
TO BACK THIS UP.

258
00:18:21,583 --> 00:18:23,125
COME HERE, LOOK.

259
00:18:23,208 --> 00:18:26,291
THIS SPECIMEN IS COMPOSED
OUT OF THESE CELLS.

260
00:18:26,375 --> 00:18:29,166
THEY'RE CALLED
AMRITA CELLS.

261
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:32,833
AND THEY'RE, AS BEST
AS WE CAN TELL, IMMORTAL.

262
00:18:32,916 --> 00:18:36,458
IF WE COULD DISCOVER
THEIR SECRET, WHO KNOWS?

263
00:18:36,541 --> 00:18:39,625
- THE PROXY IS THE KEY
TO OUR SURVIVAL.

264
00:18:39,708 --> 00:18:42,416
BUT NOW
IT'S BEEN LOST.

265
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:48,041
SO THEN,
ROMDEAU MUST ALSO HAVE--

266
00:18:48,125 --> 00:18:51,583
- YES.  WE MUST
NEVER FORGET

267
00:18:51,666 --> 00:18:54,708
WE HAVE OUR OWN
LITTLE SECRETS, DON'T WE?

268
00:18:54,791 --> 00:18:57,583
- THERE'S MORE THAN ONE
PROXY OUT THERE.

269
00:18:57,666 --> 00:18:59,625
- YES, THAT WOULD BE IT.

270
00:18:59,708 --> 00:19:02,375
- HEY, DON'T TREAT ME
LIKE I'M AN IDIOT.

271
00:19:02,458 --> 00:19:04,000
- ALL RIGHT.

272
00:19:04,083 --> 00:19:07,416
THEN THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE
I WANT TO ASK YOU.

273
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,833
TELL ME, WHERE DID YOU
EVER MANAGE

274
00:19:09,916 --> 00:19:11,416
TO LEARN
THE WORD "PROXY"?

275
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,750
- YOU KNOW YOU LEFT ME ALONE
IN YOUR OFFICE.

276
00:19:15,833 --> 00:19:17,750
- RE-L.

277
00:19:17,833 --> 00:19:19,750
- TO BE HONEST, I--

278
00:19:19,833 --> 00:19:23,833
I DON'T KNOW WHY I'M SO DRAWN
TO ALL OF THIS.

279
00:19:23,916 --> 00:19:27,416
- COULDN'T HELP YOURSELF?
- IT'S NOT JUST THAT.

280
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:31,250
SUDDENLY SOMETHING
HAD CHANGED.

281
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,041
IF I HAD SIMPLY
DONE MY JOB

282
00:19:40,125 --> 00:19:42,083
AND WALKED AWAY
FROM THIS MESS,

283
00:19:42,166 --> 00:19:44,291
I'D STILL HAVE
MY LIFE--

284
00:19:44,375 --> 00:19:47,833
MY LIFE BEFORE I'D RUINED
EVERYTHING WITH THESE QUESTIONS

285
00:19:47,916 --> 00:19:50,541
AND THEIR
TERRIBLE ANSWERS.

286
00:19:50,625 --> 00:19:53,166
BUT--
- BUT?

287
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:55,791
- I ASKED MY QUESTIONS

288
00:19:55,875 --> 00:19:59,333
AND THEN I DISCOVERED
A WHOLE WORLD I NEVER KNEW.

289
00:19:59,416 --> 00:20:02,000
THAT'S MY TROUBLE
WITH QUESTIONS--

290
00:20:02,083 --> 00:20:04,541
I STILL DON'T KNOW
HOW TO TAKE THEM BACK.

291
00:20:04,625 --> 00:20:07,500
- YES, THAT SOUNDS
LIKE YOU.

292
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,833
SEE, I'M KIND OF
THE SAME WAY.

293
00:20:11,916 --> 00:20:14,000
I LIKE ANSWERS.

294
00:20:14,083 --> 00:20:16,833
THAT'S WHY I'M HERE.

295
00:20:16,916 --> 00:20:19,291
- DAEDALUS.
- HMM?

296
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:23,250
- ( door opens )

297
00:20:34,583 --> 00:20:37,291
- ( Vincent's voice )
IT'S JUST THE TWO OF US NOW.

298
00:20:38,708 --> 00:20:42,208
NO, THAT THING'S
AN AUTOREIV.

299
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,125
I'M ALONE, AGAIN.

300
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:54,750
- VINCE, WE'RE GOING
TO WHERE YOU WERE BORN, RIGHT?

301
00:20:54,833 --> 00:20:56,833
- YEAH.

302
00:21:01,166 --> 00:21:03,083
- WHAT KIND OF PLACE
IS IT?

303
00:21:03,166 --> 00:21:05,541
- IT'S--

304
00:21:05,625 --> 00:21:08,750
YOU'LL SEE
WHEN WE GET THERE.

305
00:21:08,833 --> 00:21:11,041
- Iggy: RE-L!

306
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:20,416
- ( gunshot )
- IGGY.

307
00:21:25,333 --> 00:21:28,666
- WHAT'S GOING ON?
THIS IS A SECURED FACILITY.

308
00:21:30,916 --> 00:21:33,250
- ( device beeps )

309
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:35,333
- CHIEF.

310
00:21:35,416 --> 00:21:37,458
- ( gasps )
THE COGITO VIRUS?

311
00:21:37,541 --> 00:21:39,041
IT CAN'T BE.

312
00:21:52,333 --> 00:21:53,458
- ( gunshot )

313
00:22:11,916 --> 00:22:14,000
- THE FOOLS.
- ( siren wailing )

314
00:22:14,083 --> 00:22:17,416
- THEY'RE WEAPONIZING
THE COGITO VIRUS.

315
00:22:19,708 --> 00:22:21,625
- LOOKS LIKE
THEY'RE AFTER ME.

316
00:22:21,708 --> 00:22:26,291
- RAUL-- HIS RECKLESSNESS
IS GOING TO GET US ALL KILLED.

317
00:22:26,375 --> 00:22:29,666
- AT LEAST NOW WE KNOW
HOW FAR HE'S WILLING TO GO.

318
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:32,375
- HE WANTS THE PROXY.

319
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:40,708
- AND ONLY ONE MAN
HOLDS THE KEY--

320
00:22:40,791 --> 00:22:42,708
VINCENT LAW.

321
00:22:42,791 --> 00:22:44,500
- ( device beeps )

322
00:22:44,583 --> 00:22:46,500
- RE-L, I'VE GOT
A RESPONSE

323
00:22:46,583 --> 00:22:48,500
FROM OUR PLANT
INSIDE THE SECURITY BUREAU.

324
00:22:48,583 --> 00:22:50,791
I'M STARTING A TRACE
ON THE TARGET.

325
00:22:51,916 --> 00:22:53,166
RE-L!

326
00:23:04,958 --> 00:23:06,708
- RE-L!

327
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:20,583
- ( Vincent's voice )
ALL ALONE,

328
00:23:20,666 --> 00:23:24,916
THE LAST ONE STANDING IS LEFT
WITH NOTHING BUT TIME TO THINK.

329
00:23:27,416 --> 00:23:29,458
THE MEMORIES
I CAN'T RECALL

330
00:23:29,541 --> 00:23:31,791
EVEN IF I WANTED
TO FORGET THEM.

331
00:23:31,875 --> 00:23:34,708
THAT UNRESOLVED THING
INSIDE MY MIND

332
00:23:34,791 --> 00:23:37,333
THAT REFUSES
TO SIT STILL--

333
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:39,458
WHAT IS IT?

334
00:23:39,541 --> 00:23:41,708
WHAT IS THIS THING
INSIDE OF ME?

335
00:23:45,625 --> 00:23:48,000
EVEN IF I KNEW,

336
00:23:48,083 --> 00:23:51,083
WHAT GOOD
WOULD IT DO ME NOW--

337
00:23:51,166 --> 00:23:53,875
NOW,

338
00:23:53,958 --> 00:23:57,708
WHEN THERE'S
NO ONE LEFT?

339
00:23:57,791 --> 00:24:01,291
IT'S SAFE TO SAY
WE'LL NEVER MEET AGAIN.

340
00:24:01,375 --> 00:24:06,083
THAT'S WHY
I MUST FORGET.

341
00:24:06,166 --> 00:24:08,583
BUT HOW?

342
00:24:08,666 --> 00:24:11,166
HOW CAN I FORGET
THAT FACE?

343
00:24:14,083 --> 00:24:16,291
- ( computer beeping )

344
00:24:32,041 --> 00:24:33,916
- ( music playing )

345
00:26:02,833 --> 00:26:05,291
- Rino: GOOD THINGS,
COMING THINGS,

346
00:26:05,375 --> 00:26:09,791
MOVING THINGS,
SAD THINGS, HAPPY THINGS,

347
00:26:09,875 --> 00:26:12,541
SINGLE THINGS,
COUPLED THINGS,

348
00:26:12,625 --> 00:26:14,500
SHINING THINGS.
