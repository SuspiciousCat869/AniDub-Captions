( panting )

4
00:01:12,416 --> 00:01:14,333
- WHERE AM I?

5
00:01:14,416 --> 00:01:16,125
- ( harmonica playing )

6
00:01:16,208 --> 00:01:18,125
- PINO.

7
00:01:33,166 --> 00:01:35,291
HEY, IS ANYBODY HERE?

8
00:01:35,375 --> 00:01:36,666
HELLO?

9
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:39,833
PINO?
WHERE IS EVERYONE?

10
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:51,833
WHAT IS THIS PLACE?

11
00:01:51,916 --> 00:01:53,833
- VINCE.

12
00:01:53,916 --> 00:01:55,375
- PINO.

13
00:01:56,958 --> 00:01:58,875
PINO?

14
00:02:01,458 --> 00:02:04,333
WHO ARE YOU?
- WELCOME TO THE LAND

15
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:06,583
WHERE THE SUN
CALLS ITS HOME.

16
00:02:07,916 --> 00:02:10,458

- I THOUGHT
I WAS IN CHAROS.

29
00:03:58,041 --> 00:03:59,625
- THAT IS
WHERE I FOUND YOU.

30
00:03:59,708 --> 00:04:02,333
YOU WERE LYING UNCONSCIOUS,
SO I BROUGHT YOU HERE.

31
00:04:04,958 --> 00:04:06,875
- LYING THERE?

32
00:04:06,958 --> 00:04:09,041
I'M SORRY.

33
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:13,291
- MY NAME IS
KAZKIS HAUER,

34
00:04:13,375 --> 00:04:15,291
THIS TOWER'S MASTER.

35
00:04:15,375 --> 00:04:17,625
YOU MUST BE
A BIT CONFUSED,

36
00:04:17,708 --> 00:04:19,625
SINCE YOU JUST
WOKE UP.

37
00:04:19,708 --> 00:04:22,916
- UM, WERE THERE
ANY OTHER SURVIVORS?

38
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,083
- WHO ELSE
COULD HAVE SURVIVED?

39
00:04:34,916 --> 00:04:36,833
- ( Rino whimpers )
- HUH?

40
00:04:36,916 --> 00:04:39,083
COME OVER HERE.

41
00:04:39,166 --> 00:04:41,041
I'LL GIVE YOU
A TREAT.

42
00:04:45,666 --> 00:04:47,583
- SHE'S AN INFECTED
AUTOREIV.

43
00:04:47,666 --> 00:04:48,833
- AUTOREIV?

44
00:04:48,916 --> 00:04:51,083
- UM, THEY'RE MACHINE-BASED.

45
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:53,291
- HMM, MACHINE.

46
00:04:54,416 --> 00:04:56,333
- HUH?

47
00:04:56,416 --> 00:04:58,958
PINO.
- ( door opens and closes )

48
00:04:59,041 --> 00:05:01,875
- I'M SORRY.
LOOKS LIKE SHE'S FEELING SHY.

49
00:05:01,958 --> 00:05:04,833
THEY SAY SHE'S GOT
THE HEART OF A CHILD.

50
00:05:04,916 --> 00:05:07,208
BUT EVEN SO,
I DON'T UNDERSTAND

51
00:05:07,291 --> 00:05:10,208
WHY SHE'S ACTING LIKE THAT
AFTER YOU RESCUED US.

52
00:05:10,291 --> 00:05:13,041
BUT WHY DID YOU
RESCUE US?

53
00:05:19,625 --> 00:05:22,666
- WHO WOULDN'T COME
TO THE AID OF A FRIEND?

54
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:24,750
- A FRIEND?

55
00:05:24,833 --> 00:05:27,541
- THOSE OF US WHO KNOW
THIS FAR CORNER OF THE WORLD

56
00:05:27,625 --> 00:05:29,541
ARE ALL FRIENDS.

57
00:05:29,625 --> 00:05:31,541
- FAR CORNER
OF THE WORLD?

58
00:05:31,625 --> 00:05:33,583
- FROM THE WORLD
THAT YOU HAVE SEEN

59
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:36,333
TO THE WORLD
THAT YOU NOW SEE,

60
00:05:36,416 --> 00:05:39,875
THOSE EYES OF YOURS
ARE STARING AT DEATH.

61
00:05:39,958 --> 00:05:42,625
- WELL, WHEN YOU LOOK
AT THINGS THAT WAY,

62
00:05:42,708 --> 00:05:45,166
I GUESS
YOU'RE PROBABLY RIGHT,

63
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:49,416
SINCE SURVIVING MEANS SEEING
SO MUCH DEATH FIRSTHAND.

64
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,708
MY FRIENDS
ALL DIED TOO.

65
00:05:51,791 --> 00:05:53,750
I'VE JUST BEEN
ON MY OWN.

66
00:05:53,833 --> 00:05:56,166
BUT WHY IS IT?

67
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:59,625
WHY AM I THE ONLY ONE
WHO SURVIVES THESE HORRORS?

68
00:05:59,708 --> 00:06:01,416
- ( glass shatters )

69
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:04,166
- I SUPPOSE YOU COULD
CALL IT FATE.

70
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:06,666
I'M SO GLAD
YOU MADE IT THIS FAR.

71
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:12,416
- HOP, HOP, STEP.

72
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,375
HOP, STEP, STEP.

73
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:17,333
OW, THAT HURTS.

74
00:06:35,666 --> 00:06:38,625
- THE LAND
WHERE THE SUN CALLS HOME.

75
00:06:38,708 --> 00:06:40,875
- ( Vincent's voice ) I HAVEN'T
SEEN SOMETHING LIKE THIS

76
00:06:40,958 --> 00:06:43,625
IN A LONG TIME.

77
00:06:43,708 --> 00:06:46,416
- PINO, WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

78
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:50,125
LOOK, IT'S LIKE A MAZE.

79
00:06:50,208 --> 00:06:52,333
HEY, WHAT'S WRONG?

80
00:06:52,416 --> 00:06:53,833
- COME ON.

81
00:06:53,916 --> 00:06:56,750
- WHAT IS IT?
ALL RIGHT. ( chuckles )

82
00:06:57,958 --> 00:07:00,208
WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?

83
00:07:10,875 --> 00:07:12,833
WHAT ARE THEY DOING HERE?

84
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,875
- LET'S GO BACK TO THE BOAT,
BACK TO THE RABBIT.

85
00:07:19,958 --> 00:07:21,416
VINCE.

86
00:07:26,583 --> 00:07:29,958
I DON'T LIKE IT HERE.
LET'S HURRY UP AND LEAVE.

87
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:37,458
IT'S SCARY.
WE CAN'T STAY HERE.

88
00:07:37,541 --> 00:07:39,625
COME ON, LET'S GO
LOOK FOR THE RABBIT.

89
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:45,500
ALL RIGHT, I'LL GO FIND IT
ALL BY MYSELF THEN.

90
00:07:52,291 --> 00:07:55,291
- BUT HE SAVED US.

91
00:07:58,291 --> 00:08:00,708
- JOIN ME FOR A DRINK.

92
00:08:00,791 --> 00:08:02,208
- THANKS, NO.

93
00:08:02,291 --> 00:08:03,750
- YOU HAVEN'T TOUCHED
YOUR PLATE.

94
00:08:03,833 --> 00:08:07,583
- WELL, IT'S JUST
THE AUTOREIVS I SAW.

95
00:08:09,583 --> 00:08:11,000
- HMM?

96
00:08:11,083 --> 00:08:13,291
OH, YOU MEAN
THE KNIGHTS?

97
00:08:13,375 --> 00:08:15,958
- THEY WERE THE ONES
FIGHTING IN CHAROS.

98
00:08:16,041 --> 00:08:18,458
THEY KILLED AN AWFUL LOT
OF PEOPLE THERE.

99
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:22,000
- WHAT'S YOUR POINT?

100
00:08:23,958 --> 00:08:26,875
WAR HAS ALWAYS BEEN
ABOUT WINNERS AND LOSERS,

101
00:08:26,958 --> 00:08:29,083
ALWAYS A MATTER
OF LIFE AND DEATH.

102
00:08:29,166 --> 00:08:32,583
NO WAR HAS EVER STARTED WITHOUT
PEOPLE KNOWING THAT FACT.

103
00:08:32,666 --> 00:08:34,583
- PERHAPS,
BUT WHAT'S THE POINT

104
00:08:34,666 --> 00:08:36,583
OF YOU CONTINUING
TO ATTACK CHAROS?

105
00:08:36,666 --> 00:08:38,583
- WAR IS POINTLESS,

106
00:08:38,666 --> 00:08:40,916
BUT BEING DESTROYED
IS NOT.

107
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,916
YOU SAW IT,
DIDN'T YOU--

108
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,750
THE END OF CHAROS?

109
00:08:45,833 --> 00:08:48,541
YOU SAW SENEX
AS SHE APPEARED.

110
00:08:48,625 --> 00:08:50,750
- SENEX?

111
00:08:50,833 --> 00:08:53,791
DID IT DESTROY CHAROS?

112
00:08:53,875 --> 00:08:55,458
- HMM.

113
00:08:57,125 --> 00:08:59,750
WHY ARE YOU SO FIXATED
ON CHAROS?

114
00:08:59,833 --> 00:09:02,041
THE WORLD IS BETTER OFF
WITHOUT THEM.

115
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:04,041
- IS THAT WHY
YOU KILLED THEM?

116
00:09:04,125 --> 00:09:06,041
- YOU'RE JOKING.
- HUH?

117
00:09:06,125 --> 00:09:08,666
- THEY WERE
LEFT BEHIND.

118
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:10,666
AND DURING
THE LONG SLEEP

119
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:12,958
THEY TRIED TO FIND
THEIR MEANING.

120
00:09:13,041 --> 00:09:15,791
BUT THEY SHIED AWAY FROM THE
FACT THAT THEY'D BEEN ABANDONED

121
00:09:15,875 --> 00:09:18,875
AND ONLY FOUND A WAY TO LIVE
THROUGH MUTUAL DESTRUCTION.

122
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:21,458
BEFORE LONG,
THE WORLD WAS IN CHAOS

123
00:09:21,541 --> 00:09:25,333
AND EVEN DEATH HAD LOST ITS
MEANING IN THEIR FEEBLE MINDS.

124
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,791
SO PATHETIC.

125
00:09:28,875 --> 00:09:31,791
YOU KNOW,
IT JUST ANGERS ME TO THINK

126
00:09:31,875 --> 00:09:34,708
THAT THOSE INTENTIONS OF THEIRS
EVEN EXISTED.

127
00:09:35,833 --> 00:09:38,208
TO THOSE
MISERABLE CREATURES.

128
00:09:41,583 --> 00:09:44,541
PERHAPS WE SHOULD BE
BEGGING FOR FORGIVENESS--

129
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:46,875
BOTH YOU AND ME.

130
00:09:46,958 --> 00:09:50,333
- WHY ME?
WAIT, HOLD ON A SECOND.

131
00:09:50,416 --> 00:09:52,750
ARE YOU SAYING
THAT I DID SOMETHING?

132
00:09:52,833 --> 00:09:55,666
I'VE DONE NOTHING BUT GET CHASED
ACROSS HALF OF CREATION.

133
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:58,541
THAT'S HOW I ENDED UP HERE.
- THERE YOU HAVE IT.

134
00:09:58,625 --> 00:10:01,041
- HUH?
- IT'S HARD NOT TO DO ANYTHING,

135
00:10:01,125 --> 00:10:04,000
NOT BEING ABLE
TO DO ANYTHING.

136
00:10:05,416 --> 00:10:07,666
IT WAS THE SAME FOR ME.

137
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:10,666
- FOR YOU TOO?
- I WAS DISGUSTED WITH MYSELF

138
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:13,250
FOR NOT BEING ABLE
TO DO ANYTHING.

139
00:10:13,333 --> 00:10:15,416
SHOWERED WITH
MY OWN INSULTS,

140
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:18,875
I COULDN'T FIND PEACE OF MIND
EVEN WHEN I SLEPT.

141
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:21,666
WITHOUT A PURPOSE,
I SIMPLY COUNTED THE MINUTES

142
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:24,708
AND SUFFERED AS MY LONG LIFE
DRAGGED ON.

143
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:28,000
I SUFFERED
JUST AS YOU DO.

144
00:10:28,083 --> 00:10:30,291
- IT WAS THE SAME
FOR YOU.

145
00:10:30,375 --> 00:10:32,916
- I FEEL
A LOVE FOR YOU,

146
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,041
NOT UNLIKE THE LOVE
I FELT FOR SENEX.

147
00:10:37,958 --> 00:10:40,000
- ( door squeaks )

148
00:10:40,083 --> 00:10:41,958
- ( wind whistling )

149
00:10:44,708 --> 00:10:47,541
- YOU LOVED SENEX?

150
00:10:47,625 --> 00:10:49,916
- IT'S TIME TO TELL YOU
ABOUT US.

151
00:10:51,666 --> 00:10:54,041
IF MY ASURA
WERE THE SUN,

152
00:10:54,125 --> 00:10:57,000
THEN CHAROS
WOULD BE THE MOON.

153
00:10:57,083 --> 00:11:00,083
SENEX AND I EACH BUILT
COMPANION TOWERS

154
00:11:00,166 --> 00:11:02,083
TO SERVE WITNESS
TO THE VOWS

155
00:11:02,166 --> 00:11:04,083
WE WOULD EXCHANGE
WHEN WE AWOKE.

156
00:11:04,166 --> 00:11:07,375
DO YOU UNDERSTAND
WHAT I'M SAYING?

157
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:11,208
SENEX AND I BOTH CAME TO SEE
THE WAY OF GRIEF.

158
00:11:11,291 --> 00:11:13,208
AND FOR THAT,
WE SUFFERED.

159
00:11:13,291 --> 00:11:17,083
AND FOR THAT, WE CAME TO HAVE
AN UNSHAKEABLE LOVE.

160
00:11:17,166 --> 00:11:19,916
BUT SENEX DIED
BEFORE WE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY

161
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,125
TO EXCHANGE OUR VOWS,
BECAUSE YOU KILLED HER.

162
00:11:24,208 --> 00:11:26,125
- NO.

163
00:11:26,208 --> 00:11:27,666
- BUT THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

164
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:30,541
VOWS HOLD LITTLE WEIGHT
IN THE EYES OF FATE.

165
00:11:30,625 --> 00:11:33,000
HONESTLY, I FEEL
TRULY HONORED

166
00:11:33,083 --> 00:11:35,000
TO HAVE MET YOU
IN THIS WAY.

167
00:11:35,083 --> 00:11:37,541
LET US BE GRATEFUL
FOR YOUR POWER.

168
00:11:38,708 --> 00:11:41,083
- WHAT?
ARE YOU INSANE?

169
00:11:41,166 --> 00:11:42,666
- WHAT'S THE MATTER?

170
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:45,500
- I DIDN'T KILL HER.
YOU'RE WRONG.

171
00:11:45,583 --> 00:11:47,583
I COULD NEVER DO
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

172
00:11:47,666 --> 00:11:49,750
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
SENEX WAS--

173
00:11:49,833 --> 00:11:51,291
- PLEASE STOP.

174
00:11:51,375 --> 00:11:54,375
- BUT YOU ARE--
- I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING.

175
00:11:54,458 --> 00:11:57,250
- THIS IS A GAME
YOU'RE PLAYING, ISN'T IT?

176
00:11:57,333 --> 00:11:59,958
- LOOK, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU THINK WE ARE.

177
00:12:00,041 --> 00:12:01,541
- JUST PLEASE

178
00:12:01,625 --> 00:12:04,250
TELL ME THAT I'M RIGHT.

179
00:12:04,333 --> 00:12:07,791
- WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU?
- PLEASE STOP.

180
00:12:07,875 --> 00:12:09,375
- HOW CAN YOU SAY THAT WHEN...
- WHY ARE YOU...

181
00:12:09,458 --> 00:12:11,041
- ...WE SHARE THE SAME GRIEF?
- ...TORMENTING ME LIKE THIS?

182
00:12:11,125 --> 00:12:13,666
- WHY?
- I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING!

183
00:12:17,708 --> 00:12:19,791
- HE DOESN'T REMEMBER.

184
00:12:19,875 --> 00:12:22,708
( screaming )
- ( glass shattering )

185
00:12:33,125 --> 00:12:35,791
- ( laughs )

186
00:12:35,875 --> 00:12:38,291
HE KILLED
MY DEAR SENEX

187
00:12:38,375 --> 00:12:40,541
WITHOUT EVEN
REALIZING IT.

188
00:12:57,916 --> 00:13:00,083
- ( Vincent panting )

189
00:13:16,916 --> 00:13:18,500
WHY?

190
00:13:18,583 --> 00:13:21,375
- THIS IS MY ASURA
AS IT REALLY IS.

191
00:13:21,458 --> 00:13:22,708
- HUH?

192
00:13:22,791 --> 00:13:26,666
- THIS IS WHAT YOU BELIEVE
TO HAVE SEEN, RIGHT?

193
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:28,666
IT'S JUST A MONUMENT.

194
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:32,416
THE CITIZENS BUILT IT SO THAT
FUTURE GENERATIONS WOULD KNOW

195
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:35,125
JUST WHAT ASURA WAS LIKE
IN THE PAST.

196
00:13:35,208 --> 00:13:37,125
BUT IT WAS
A WORTHLESS EFFORT.

197
00:13:37,208 --> 00:13:39,125
- WHAT HAPPENED
TO THE CITIZENS?

198
00:13:39,208 --> 00:13:41,125
- THEY WERE
COMPLETELY WIPED OUT,

199
00:13:41,208 --> 00:13:43,125
EXTERMINATED
BY THE KNIGHTS.

200
00:13:43,208 --> 00:13:44,375
- YOU COULDN'T.

201
00:13:44,458 --> 00:13:47,125
- CHAROS AND ASURA
ARE ONE.

202
00:13:47,208 --> 00:13:49,166
THE CITIZENS ALL DIED
IN THE WAR

203
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:51,166
AND ONLY THE KNIGHTS
REMAIN.

204
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:54,250
- BUT WHAT ABOUT
THE SOLDIERS IN CHAROS?

205
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:56,583
- THEY WERE SIMPLY
A FALSE PEOPLE.

206
00:13:56,666 --> 00:13:58,958
IN DEATH, THE EXISTENCE
OF NOTHING

207
00:13:59,041 --> 00:14:00,708
RETURNS TO NOTHING.

208
00:14:00,791 --> 00:14:03,916
- BUT THEY WERE STILL
LIVING BEINGS.

209
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,250
THE LIVING HAVE NO CHOICE
BUT TO GO ON LIVING.

210
00:14:07,333 --> 00:14:10,708
- THE LIVING?
NOW THAT THEY'RE GONE,

211
00:14:10,791 --> 00:14:13,583
WE CAN CONSIDER THIS ALL
A BLESSING.

212
00:14:13,666 --> 00:14:17,125
- WHY?  AREN'T YOU
THE MASTER OF THIS PLACE?

213
00:14:17,208 --> 00:14:19,125
SHOULDN'T YOU HAVE PROTECTED
YOUR CITIZENS?

214
00:14:19,208 --> 00:14:21,500
- IT SEEMS
YOU REALLY ARE A FOOL.

215
00:14:21,583 --> 00:14:25,208
HAVE YOU LOST YOUR EYE FOR THE
TRUTH AS WELL AS YOUR MEMORY?

216
00:14:25,291 --> 00:14:27,083
- I HAVE NO PROBLEM
WITH MY MEMORY.

217
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:28,916
- THEN TELL ME
WHO YOU REALLY ARE.

218
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,125
- WHAT?

219
00:14:30,208 --> 00:14:32,250
- TRY AND TELL ME
WHO YOU ARE.

220
00:14:32,333 --> 00:14:34,250
- I'M VINCENT LAW.

221
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:37,625
I WORKED AT ROMDEAU'S
AUTOREIV DISPOSAL UNIT FACILITY,

222
00:14:37,708 --> 00:14:40,458
BUT I WAS FALSELY ACCUSED
OF THE CRIME OF TREASON

223
00:14:40,541 --> 00:14:42,958
AND FLED FROM THE DOME.
- AND BEFORE THAT?

224
00:14:43,041 --> 00:14:46,166
- I LIVED IN THE MOSK DOME.
I EMIGRATED FROM THERE.

225
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:48,291
- AND WHAT DID YOU DO
BACK IN MOSK?

226
00:14:48,375 --> 00:14:50,291
- DO?

227
00:14:51,875 --> 00:14:54,125
- YOU DON'T REMEMBER,
DO YOU?

228
00:14:54,208 --> 00:14:56,750
DESPITE HAVING
SUCH LIMITED MEMORIES,

229
00:14:56,833 --> 00:14:59,208
YOU'VE LIVED UNTIL NOW
WITHOUT ANY DOUBTS.

230
00:14:59,291 --> 00:15:01,916
THAT ITSELF
IS THE GREATEST PROOF

231
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,416
THAT YOU INTENTIONALLY ERASED
YOUR MEMORY, IS IT NOT?

232
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:08,791
- MY MEMORY?
- YOU SAID YOU WERE IN MOSK.

233
00:15:08,875 --> 00:15:11,333
- YES, IN MY HOMETOWN.

234
00:15:11,416 --> 00:15:14,458
- I SEE.
BUT IT MUST BE MONAD.

235
00:15:14,541 --> 00:15:16,958
YOU MUST HAVE TRANSFERRED
YOUR MEMORIES TO MONAD.

236
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:18,958
IT WAS TOO MUCH
FOR ANYONE,

237
00:15:19,041 --> 00:15:21,458
BUT MONAD STILL ACCEPTED
THOSE MEMORIES

238
00:15:21,541 --> 00:15:25,041
IN SPITE OF
THE REPERCUSSIONS,

239
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:27,041
BECAUSE MONAD LOVED YOU.

240
00:15:28,916 --> 00:15:31,000
BUT IN THIS DISPLAY
OF UNREQUITED LOVE,

241
00:15:31,083 --> 00:15:33,375
MONAD COMPLETELY
LOST YOU.

242
00:15:33,458 --> 00:15:35,375
NO, NOT ONLY MONAD.

243
00:15:35,458 --> 00:15:37,750
YOU LOST YOURSELF
AS WELL.

244
00:15:37,833 --> 00:15:40,000
WE ARE THE SUM
OF OUR MEMORIES.

245
00:15:40,083 --> 00:15:42,625
ERASING THE MEMORIES
ETCHED INTO ONE'S OWN SELF

246
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:44,625
IS THE SAME
AS LOSING ONESELF.

247
00:15:44,708 --> 00:15:48,000
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING TO ME?

248
00:15:48,083 --> 00:15:50,625
- WHAT I'M SAYING IS THAT
YOU ARE A TRAITOR, VINCENT LAW.

249
00:15:50,708 --> 00:15:53,500
- A TRAITOR?
WHO DID I BETRAY?

250
00:15:53,583 --> 00:15:55,333
- YOU RAN AWAY.

251
00:15:55,416 --> 00:15:58,583
THAT IS THE MOST SHAMEFUL THING
FOR A PROXY TO DO.

252
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:01,625
- A PROXY?
- BUT WHAT'S MORE UNFORGIVABLE

253
00:16:01,708 --> 00:16:05,000
THAN ERASING YOUR MEMORIES,
EVEN RUNNING AWAY--

254
00:16:05,083 --> 00:16:09,458
YOU MURDERED
MY BELOVED SENEX!

255
00:16:14,625 --> 00:16:17,875
LOOK UPON
THE AGENT OF LIGHT--

256
00:16:17,958 --> 00:16:20,333
KAZKIS PROXY.

257
00:16:20,416 --> 00:16:21,916
ON MY HONOR,

258
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,708
I WILL ANNIHILATE
THE TRAITOR.

259
00:16:26,625 --> 00:16:28,583
- ( beeping, whirring )

260
00:16:33,958 --> 00:16:35,333
- ( yells )

261
00:16:47,708 --> 00:16:49,625
- ( Vincent screams )

262
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:52,958
- VINCENT, EVEN THOUGH
YOU ERASED YOUR MEMORY

263
00:16:53,041 --> 00:16:55,833
AND LOST YOURSELF, YOU STILL
HAVE YOUR INSTINCTS, DON'T YOU?

264
00:16:55,916 --> 00:16:57,833
WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT,

265
00:16:57,916 --> 00:17:01,458
IT'S THE ONES WHO'VE GONE MAD
WHO ARE THE MOST IN DARING,

266
00:17:01,541 --> 00:17:03,458
LIKE MY DEAR SENEX

267
00:17:03,541 --> 00:17:06,083
IF THAT'S THE CASE,
THEN LET ME GO MAD TOO!

268
00:17:06,166 --> 00:17:07,750
- ( gunshots )
- ( Vincent exclaims )

269
00:17:07,833 --> 00:17:10,875
- OH, I'M SO SORRY.
DID THAT HURT?

270
00:17:10,958 --> 00:17:13,000
( laughing )

271
00:17:24,666 --> 00:17:27,583
- HOP, HOP, HOP.
RABBIT!

272
00:17:27,666 --> 00:17:29,375
- ( moaning )

273
00:17:33,041 --> 00:17:35,250
( coughing )

274
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:01,291
( screaming )

275
00:18:04,916 --> 00:18:07,166
WHAT'S HAPPENING TO ME?

276
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:10,458
MY ARM.

277
00:18:21,708 --> 00:18:23,958
HELP ME.

278
00:18:24,041 --> 00:18:25,916
IT HURTS!

279
00:18:28,833 --> 00:18:30,750
AM I A MONSTER?

280
00:18:30,833 --> 00:18:32,916
NO, I'M A--

281
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,875
- YOU ARE A PROXY.

282
00:18:36,625 --> 00:18:39,208
- A PROXY?

283
00:18:39,291 --> 00:18:42,250
- AH, DO YOU KNOW
WHAT I'M FEELING?

284
00:18:42,333 --> 00:18:43,500
DO YOU?

285
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:47,041
I'M FEELING REVOLTED
AND I'M NAUSEATED.

286
00:18:47,125 --> 00:18:49,041
- YES, THAT'S IT.
- ( moaning )

287
00:18:49,125 --> 00:18:52,625
- IT'S BECAUSE OF YOU,
YOU BASTARD.

288
00:18:53,958 --> 00:18:56,375
I'LL GIVE YOU ONE LAST CHANCE
TO TELL ME

289
00:18:56,458 --> 00:18:58,833
YOU ARE THE AGENT
OF ONE.

290
00:19:00,708 --> 00:19:04,083
YOU CAN'T ANSWER.
VERY WELL.

291
00:19:04,166 --> 00:19:06,750
THEN YOU CAN DIE!

292
00:19:08,625 --> 00:19:10,625
GO AHEAD AND RUN,

293
00:19:10,708 --> 00:19:13,000
BUT YOU ARE IN A TRAP,

294
00:19:13,083 --> 00:19:15,208
JUST THE SAME AS ME.

295
00:19:15,291 --> 00:19:18,541
- 98 RABBITS, 99 RABBITS,

296
00:19:18,625 --> 00:19:20,708
100 RABBITS.

297
00:19:20,791 --> 00:19:22,541
FINE.

298
00:19:22,625 --> 00:19:25,708
I'VE COUNTED TO 100,
SO I'M GOING TO LEAVE VINCE NOW.

299
00:19:31,125 --> 00:19:33,291
I'LL COUNT ANOTHER 50.

300
00:19:33,375 --> 00:19:36,875
101 RABBITS, 102 RABBITS,

301
00:19:36,958 --> 00:19:39,416
103 RABBITS...

302
00:19:49,166 --> 00:19:53,875
- ( screams ) NO!

303
00:19:56,208 --> 00:19:58,500
- ( glass shatters )
- Kazkis: THIS ONE'S NO GOOD.

304
00:19:58,583 --> 00:20:01,708
IT'S NOT FRAGRANT.
THIS ONE'S BAD TOO.

305
00:20:01,791 --> 00:20:04,000
IT'S GOT A COARSE
AND SOUR TASTE.

306
00:20:04,083 --> 00:20:06,166
NOT A DECENT ONE LEFT.

307
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:08,708
THEY'RE ALL
WORTHLESS PISS.

308
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,333
- YOU MUST TELL ME,

309
00:20:12,416 --> 00:20:14,750
WHAT THE HELL
IS A PROXY?

310
00:20:14,833 --> 00:20:18,708
- HOW DARE YOU ASK THAT AFTER
YOU WIPED OUT YOUR OWN MEMORY?

311
00:20:18,791 --> 00:20:21,583
- THEN TELL ME,
AM I A PROXY?

312
00:20:21,666 --> 00:20:24,666
I DON'T WANT TO FIGHT
AGAINST YOU LIKE THIS.

313
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:26,958
- THEY WHY DID YOU
COME BACK?

314
00:20:27,041 --> 00:20:29,708
BECAUSE YOU WANT
TO KILL ME NOW, RIGHT?

315
00:20:29,791 --> 00:20:31,208
- YOU'RE WRONG.

316
00:20:31,291 --> 00:20:32,833
- IT'S THE TIME
OF THE AWAKENING.

317
00:20:32,916 --> 00:20:35,250
- I DON'T WANT
TO HURT ANYONE.

318
00:20:35,333 --> 00:20:38,250
- ALL RIGHT,
THEN WHO KILLED SENEX?

319
00:20:38,333 --> 00:20:40,833
IS SENEX THE ONLY ONE
YOU'VE KILLED?

320
00:20:47,375 --> 00:20:50,750
- ( screams )

321
00:20:55,375 --> 00:20:57,291
- YOU'VE LOST YOUR WAY

322
00:20:57,375 --> 00:20:59,291
AND THE ONE YOU LOVE.

323
00:20:59,375 --> 00:21:01,333
WHY DO YOU WANT TO LIVE
SO BADLY?

324
00:21:01,416 --> 00:21:03,333
WHY NOT JUST DIE HERE?

325
00:21:03,416 --> 00:21:06,250
- ( grunting ) 

326
00:21:07,708 --> 00:21:11,791
- SENEX, I WANTED TO SEE YOU
ALIVE ONE LAST TIME.

327
00:21:11,875 --> 00:21:13,958
BUT I PROMISE

328
00:21:14,041 --> 00:21:16,541
I WILL AVENGE
YOUR DEATH.

329
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:25,875
- ( growling )

330
00:21:37,583 --> 00:21:39,250
( screams )

331
00:21:46,458 --> 00:21:49,958
TELL ME,
WHY IS THIS HAPPENING?

332
00:21:50,041 --> 00:21:51,625
WHY?

333
00:21:51,708 --> 00:21:53,500
- THEN I'LL ASK YOU
AGAIN:

334
00:21:53,583 --> 00:21:56,583
WHAT ARE YOU
THE AGENT OF?

335
00:22:02,125 --> 00:22:03,875
- MY NAME

336
00:22:03,958 --> 00:22:06,208
IS ERGO PROXY

337
00:22:06,291 --> 00:22:08,833
AND I AM
THE AGENT OF DEATH.

338
00:22:08,916 --> 00:22:11,500
- REALLY?

339
00:22:11,583 --> 00:22:13,458
( grunts )

340
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:17,125
GO AHEAD AND SUFFER.

341
00:22:17,208 --> 00:22:20,208
ALL THOSE WHO WANDER IN
THE DARKNESS SEEK THE LIGHT.

342
00:22:20,291 --> 00:22:22,208
BUT WHEN THEY REACH
THE LIGHT,

343
00:22:22,291 --> 00:22:25,208
THEY TURN THEIR EYES AWAY
FROM THE BLINDING GLARE.

344
00:22:25,291 --> 00:22:27,583
I CAN EVEN SENSE
THE PAIN.

345
00:22:27,666 --> 00:22:29,916
THE TRUTH
IS LIKE THAT TOO.

346
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,750
SOMEDAY YOUR EYES WILL BE BURNT
BY THE LIGHT OF TRUTH

347
00:22:33,833 --> 00:22:35,916
AND YOU WILL KNOW
ETERNAL DARKNESS.

348
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,875
THAT IS THE JUDGMENT
THAT AWAITS.

349
00:22:38,958 --> 00:22:42,125
( laughing )

350
00:22:54,333 --> 00:22:56,208
SENEX.

351
00:23:06,541 --> 00:23:09,791
- IF I AM NOT HUMAN,

352
00:23:09,875 --> 00:23:12,666
HOW AM I SUPPOSED
TO GO ON?

353
00:23:16,375 --> 00:23:19,000
- 400 RABBITS.

354
00:23:22,875 --> 00:23:23,958
( gasps )

355
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:28,541
VINCE.

356
00:23:28,625 --> 00:23:30,958
- PINO.
- ARE YOU HURT?

357
00:23:31,041 --> 00:23:32,958
- NO.

358
00:23:35,333 --> 00:23:38,708
THAT'S NOT MY BLOOD.
- OH, THEN IT'S THE OTHER ONE'S.

359
00:23:40,583 --> 00:23:43,750
NOT YOUR BLOOD,
BUT FROM THE OTHER VINCE, RIGHT?

360
00:23:43,833 --> 00:23:45,833
WELCOME BACK.

361
00:23:47,583 --> 00:23:50,541
- THEN YOU KNEW
ABOUT IT?

362
00:23:58,250 --> 00:24:00,166
LET'S GO TO MOSK.

363
00:24:08,416 --> 00:24:11,333
YOU WEREN'T
AFRAID OF ME, WERE YOU?

364
00:24:11,416 --> 00:24:12,541
- AFRAID?

365
00:24:12,625 --> 00:24:15,500
BUT YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO ALWAYS HELPS ME.

366
00:24:15,583 --> 00:24:17,500
- IS THAT SO?

367
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,666
- ( Vincent's voice )
WE CAN'T SEE IT,

368
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:24,541
BUT FROM THE MOMENT
WE LEAPT FROM ROMDEAU

369
00:24:24,625 --> 00:24:27,666
IT WAS ALL
SET INTO MOTION.
