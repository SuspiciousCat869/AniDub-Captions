1
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,458
- Re-l: AS A YOUNG GIRL,

2
00:00:37,541 --> 00:00:41,916
I THOUGHT THE WORLD
WOULD END WHEN I DIED.

3
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,041
IT WAS A CHILDISH IDEA.

4
00:00:44,125 --> 00:00:47,625
I JUST COULDN'T IMAGINE A WORLD
THAT COULD EXIST WITHOUT ME.

5
00:00:51,083 --> 00:00:53,458
STOP HOVERING AROUND ME
IN THAT THING.

6
00:00:55,458 --> 00:00:58,125
- HEY, LET'S NOT FORGET
THIS IS YOUR FAULT, RE-L.

7
00:00:58,208 --> 00:00:59,958
BOTH YOURS AND PINO'S.

8
00:01:00,041 --> 00:01:02,166
- I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING WRONG.

9
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:04,541
- YOU FELL IN ALL BY YOURSELF.

10
00:01:04,625 --> 00:01:07,708
- THAT'S HARSH.
I THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO DIE.

11
00:01:07,791 --> 00:01:10,000
- IT WOULDN'T HAVE KILLED YOU.

12
00:01:12,541 --> 00:01:14,333
I SEE THE DOME.

13
00:01:19,041 --> 00:01:21,416
- I AM MYSELF.

14
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:24,250
NOT SOMEONE ELSE.

15
00:01:24,333 --> 00:01:26,875
I KNOW HOW STRANGE IT WAS.

16
00:01:26,958 --> 00:01:30,416
I REMEMBER.

17
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:33,000
I KNOW MY MEMORIES
CAN BE TREACHEROUS.

18
00:01:33,083 --> 00:01:35,041
BUT OF THIS MEMORY,

19
00:01:35,125 --> 00:01:45,083
I'M CERTAIN.

20
00:01:45,166 --> 00:01:53,333

- YAY, SHOPPING!

35
00:03:47,541 --> 00:03:50,250
- A COMPLETELY ABANDONED
GROCERY STORE.

36
00:03:54,541 --> 00:03:57,000
THIS IS GREAT.

37
00:03:57,083 --> 00:03:59,791
- THIS PLACE IS LIKE
A SHELL.

38
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:04,250
EVERYTHING BUT PEOPLE.

39
00:04:04,333 --> 00:04:07,875
- Iggy: RE-L! ( echoing )
- IGGY!

40
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:13,333
NO AUTOREIVS, EITHER.

41
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,041
I'M GETTING PARANOID.

42
00:05:09,958 --> 00:05:11,666
- WELCOME TO OUR STORE.

43
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:14,791
- Vincent:
HEY, FIND ANYTHING OUT THERE?

44
00:05:14,875 --> 00:05:17,083
- SAME NOTHING
AS EVERYWHERE ELSE.

45
00:05:19,291 --> 00:05:21,833
- SO WOULD YOU LIKE
TO HAVE SOMETHING TO EAT?

46
00:05:26,166 --> 00:05:29,875
- I TOLD YOU I WAS
SICK OF BEANS.

47
00:05:29,958 --> 00:05:31,666
- YOU NEVER SAID THAT.

48
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:34,416
YOU WANT SOMETHING TO DRINK?
COFFEE, TEA?

49
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,791
- GINGER ALE.

50
00:05:35,875 --> 00:05:38,958
- YOU DRANK THE GINGER ALE.
WE'RE OUT.

51
00:05:39,041 --> 00:05:41,291
- I'M FINE THEN.

52
00:05:41,375 --> 00:05:44,125
- WHY IS IT ALWAYS
LIKE THIS?

53
00:05:52,291 --> 00:05:55,416
- HOW LONG ARE WE STAYING HERE?
- WHAT?

54
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:58,250
- WE SHOULD LEAVE ONCE
THE SHIP'S RESTOCKED.

55
00:05:58,333 --> 00:06:01,791
- SHOULDN'T WE WAIT TILL
WE'VE TRIED ALL THE FLAVORS?

56
00:06:01,875 --> 00:06:04,375
- THIS IS SUPPOSED
TO BE YOUR JOURNEY.

57
00:06:07,541 --> 00:06:08,750
WHAT NOW?

58
00:06:08,833 --> 00:06:11,250
- HERE YOU GO.
HELP YOURSELF.

59
00:06:11,333 --> 00:06:14,250
- I THOUGHT THAT AUTOREIVS
KNEW HOW TO COOK.

60
00:06:14,333 --> 00:06:17,500
- THE PINO SPECIAL.
AND IT'S VERY NUTRITIOUS.

61
00:06:20,625 --> 00:06:23,250
- GO AND FINISH
STOCKING THE SHIP.

62
00:06:23,333 --> 00:06:26,791
- WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
- I'M GONNA STAND GUARD.

63
00:06:26,875 --> 00:06:30,458
- WHAT ABOUT YOUR FOOD?
- I'LL EAT LATER.

64
00:06:30,541 --> 00:06:33,791
- ( groans )

65
00:06:33,875 --> 00:06:35,166
I DON'T EAT,

66
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:37,791
SO I GUESS YOU'LL GET
TO HAVE IT ALL BY YOURSELF.

67
00:06:37,875 --> 00:06:39,791
- PINO,

68
00:06:39,875 --> 00:06:42,250
I DON'T KNOW.

69
00:06:44,291 --> 00:06:45,833
IT LOOKS GREAT!
<i>( retching )</i>

70
00:06:53,375 --> 00:06:56,083
- DAMN IT.

71
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:59,500
I SWEAR THE TWO OF THEM,
THEY'RE GONNA DRIVE ME CRAZY.

72
00:07:05,875 --> 00:07:08,291
YOU SHOULD TRY RELAXING
ONCE IN A WHILE.

73
00:07:08,375 --> 00:07:11,916
- YOU CHEWED ME OUT
FOR NOT PACKING FAST ENOUGH.

74
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,250
WEREN'T YOU GONNA
STAND GUARD?

75
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:15,583
- I HAVEN'T FINISHED
EATING MY MEAL.

76
00:07:15,666 --> 00:07:17,250
- WHAT IS WITH YOU?

77
00:07:17,333 --> 00:07:20,708
- DID YOU SAY SOMETHING?
- NO, NOTHING.

78
00:07:20,791 --> 00:07:24,125
OH, BY THE WAY.

79
00:07:24,208 --> 00:07:26,833
GINGER ALE.
I FOUND SOME IN BACK.

80
00:07:26,916 --> 00:07:28,250
- THANK YOU.

81
00:07:28,333 --> 00:07:30,375
- HEY, VINCE,
WILL THIS WORK OKAY?

82
00:07:30,458 --> 00:07:32,625
- WE'RE GONNA GO
COLLECT SOME WATER.

83
00:07:49,791 --> 00:07:52,541
GINGER ALE.
I FOUND SOME IN BACK.

84
00:07:52,625 --> 00:07:56,166
- THANK YOU.
- ( bottle opens )

85
00:07:59,375 --> 00:08:01,166
- THIS DRINK TASTES FUNNY.

86
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:04,500
- WHAT IS WITH YOU?
- ARE YOU DONE PACKING?

87
00:08:04,583 --> 00:08:06,166
- I WAS THINKING

88
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:08,875
MAYBE WE COULD STAY HERE
FOR A WHILE.

89
00:08:08,958 --> 00:08:11,333
- WE'RE LEAVING ONCE
WE'VE RESUPPLIED.

90
00:08:11,416 --> 00:08:13,625
- WHAT'S THE BIG RUSH?
HOW OFTEN DO WE GET A CHANCE

91
00:08:13,708 --> 00:08:16,958
TO RELAX LIKE THIS?
- THAT'S ENOUGH.

92
00:08:17,041 --> 00:08:20,000
- WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?
WHY DO YOU TALK THAT WAY?

93
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:21,166
- HUH?

94
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:23,708
- WHY CAN'T YOU TRY BEING
A LITTLE NICER?

95
00:08:23,791 --> 00:08:27,083
- IF YOU EXPECT ME
TO CODDLE THE TWO OF YOU--

96
00:08:27,166 --> 00:08:29,666
- I THOUGHT YOU
HAD FEELINGS FOR ME, RE-L.

97
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:31,916
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

98
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,541
- COME ON, DON'T YOU LIKE ME?
- BACK OFF!

99
00:08:38,291 --> 00:08:40,833
GET UP.
IT'S NOT FUNNY.

100
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:49,958
ENOUGH, VINCENT,
STOP FOOLING AROUND.

101
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:59,125
- SO WHAT'S LEFT?
- ( door opens )

102
00:08:59,208 --> 00:09:00,291
- HUH?

103
00:09:06,125 --> 00:09:10,000
HEY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING
IN HERE?

104
00:09:10,083 --> 00:09:12,041
- ARE YOU DONE PLAYING
YOUR WEIRD LITTLE PRANKS?

105
00:09:12,125 --> 00:09:13,916
- WHAT?
I'M PACKING THE SHIP.

106
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,083
- SPARE THE EXCUSES.
WHERE'S THE AUTOREIV?

107
00:09:17,166 --> 00:09:19,458
- IF YOU MEAN PINO,
SHE WAS JUST HERE.

108
00:09:19,541 --> 00:09:22,125
- HERE I AM.
- HEY!

109
00:09:22,208 --> 00:09:24,041
- COME BACK!
- ( grunting )

110
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:28,583
- OPEN THE DOOR!
- NOT TILL YOU CALM DOWN.

111
00:09:28,666 --> 00:09:32,125
NOW TELL ME WHAT PINO DID.
- IT WANTS TO KILL ME.

112
00:09:32,208 --> 00:09:35,291
- WHAT?  NO, SHE DOESN'T.
- IT'S DANGEROUS!

113
00:09:35,375 --> 00:09:38,875
- YOU'RE STAYING IN THERE
FOR A WHILE.

114
00:09:42,333 --> 00:09:45,458
- Vincent: DID YOU DO SOMETHING?
- Pino: I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

115
00:09:45,541 --> 00:09:49,125
- YOU MUST HAVE DONE SOMETHING.
- I THOUGHT SHE'D LIKE IT.

116
00:09:49,208 --> 00:09:52,291
- IT'S OKAY.
JUST TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED.

117
00:09:52,375 --> 00:09:55,916
- ALL I DID WAS TRY TO GIVE
HER ANOTHER BOWL OF FOOD.

118
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,208
- YOU MEAN YOUR FOOD.

119
00:09:57,291 --> 00:10:00,625
THAT'S A FAR CRY
FROM TRYING TO KILL HER.

120
00:10:03,291 --> 00:10:05,791
RE-L!

121
00:10:08,416 --> 00:10:11,958
RE-L!
- WHAT ARE WE SUPPOSED TO DO?

122
00:10:15,666 --> 00:10:18,833
- WHO IS THAT?
WATCH HER.

123
00:10:18,916 --> 00:10:21,416
- WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
- THERE'S SOMEONE UP THERE.

124
00:10:36,083 --> 00:10:39,041
DID SHE JUMP FROM UP HERE?

125
00:10:39,125 --> 00:10:40,541
WHY?

126
00:10:40,625 --> 00:10:43,208
- DON'T MOVE.
- RE-L, IS THAT YOU?

127
00:10:43,291 --> 00:10:45,500
- TELL ME EXACTLY
WHAT YOU ARE.

128
00:10:45,583 --> 00:10:47,541
- WHAT?  YOU KNOW ME.
IT'S VINCENT.

129
00:10:47,625 --> 00:10:50,791
- THAT'S NOT WHAT I'M ASKING.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

130
00:10:50,875 --> 00:10:53,166
- ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
ARE YOU HURT OR SOMETHING?

131
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:55,750
- DON'T MAKE ANOTHER MOVE.
JUST ANSWER MY QUESTION.

132
00:10:55,833 --> 00:10:57,250
WHAT ARE YOU?

133
00:10:57,333 --> 00:11:00,000
- YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN TRYING
TO FIGURE THAT OUT MYSELF.

134
00:11:00,083 --> 00:11:01,625
- IS THAT YOUR
ANSWER THIS TIME?

135
00:11:01,708 --> 00:11:04,125
DON'T YOU DARE MAKE A MOVE.

136
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:09,541
- RE-L.

137
00:11:14,625 --> 00:11:16,750
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

138
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:24,416
SORRY TO KEEP YOU WAITING.
- IS RE-L OKAY?

139
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:27,583
- DON'T WORRY ABOUT HER.  NOW
WE JUST NEED TO GET OUT OF HERE.

140
00:11:34,208 --> 00:11:37,166
- VINCE, WHERE ARE WE GOING?
- NOT FAR.

141
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:38,791
DO YOU LIKE ME, PINO?

142
00:11:38,875 --> 00:11:41,541
- YEAH, I LIKE YOU A LOT, VINCE.

143
00:11:41,625 --> 00:11:43,125
BECAUSE YOU LIKE
TO EAT MY FOOD.

144
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:58,166
WHAT ARE YOU DOING, VINCE?

145
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:00,708
- WE CAN'T JUST LEAVE HER LYING

146
00:12:00,791 --> 00:12:03,083
ON THE COLD HARD GROUND.

147
00:12:03,166 --> 00:12:04,625
YOU SEE,

148
00:12:04,708 --> 00:12:07,833
WE HAVE TO
GIVE HER A PROPER BURIAL.

149
00:12:07,916 --> 00:12:10,458
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
DID RE-L DIE?

150
00:12:10,541 --> 00:12:13,166
- SHE HAD TO GO AWAY.

151
00:12:15,041 --> 00:12:17,916
THIS IS HOW PEOPLE
LEAVE THE WORLD.

152
00:12:37,791 --> 00:12:39,125
( panting )

153
00:12:54,333 --> 00:12:57,208
RE-L!

154
00:12:57,291 --> 00:12:59,208
PINO!

155
00:13:05,333 --> 00:13:07,375
THE SHIP IS GONE.

156
00:13:07,458 --> 00:13:11,041
THEY LEFT ME BEHIND.

157
00:13:11,125 --> 00:13:12,833
I'M ALONE AGAIN.

158
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:34,375
- WHERE'S RE-L GOING?

159
00:13:34,458 --> 00:13:36,791
- RE-L'S NO LONGER WITH US.

160
00:13:36,875 --> 00:13:38,666
IT'LL BE EASIER THIS WAY.

161
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:41,333
- BUT THE OTHER
ONE'S STILL HERE.

162
00:13:41,416 --> 00:13:43,041
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

163
00:13:43,125 --> 00:13:45,750
- THERE'S ANOTHER ONE
OF YOU ALSO, VINCE.

164
00:13:45,833 --> 00:13:47,666
- THERE'S ONLY ONE VINCENT.

165
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:49,208
I'M THE ONE YOU LIKE,

166
00:13:49,291 --> 00:13:51,333
I'M THE ONE WHO EATS
YOUR SPECIAL FOOD.

167
00:13:51,416 --> 00:13:55,208
- NO, THE OTHER VINCE
ATE MY FOOD.

168
00:13:55,291 --> 00:13:58,875
THERE ARE TWO VINCES,
AND THERE ARE TWO RE-LS.

169
00:13:58,958 --> 00:14:02,375
I WONDER WHY THERE'S ONLY
ONE PINO HERE-- HUH?

170
00:14:02,458 --> 00:14:04,625
- ( grunting )

171
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:09,166
- YOU'RE NOT THE REAL ONE.

172
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:12,000
- YOU'RE AN AUTOREIV.

173
00:14:13,458 --> 00:14:16,791
- NO!
- DAMN IT!

174
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:43,875
RE-L.

175
00:14:54,125 --> 00:14:56,416
( gasps )

176
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:58,625
RE-L, PLEASE!

177
00:14:58,708 --> 00:15:01,208
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO
IF YOU DIE ON ME?

178
00:15:01,291 --> 00:15:03,833
YOU STILL HAVE TO
SHOOT ME, REMEMBER?

179
00:15:05,875 --> 00:15:09,000
THANK GOD!
I THOUGHT YOU WERE DEAD.

180
00:15:10,458 --> 00:15:12,500
- YOU DID?

181
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:21,500
THEN MAYBE YOU HAVE
A LITTLE DEATH WISH, TOO.

182
00:15:28,416 --> 00:15:31,291
- ARE YOU OK?

183
00:15:31,375 --> 00:15:34,000
- DID YOU REALLY JUST SAVE
MY LIFE?

184
00:15:34,083 --> 00:15:36,666
- YOU HAD ME WORRIED.

185
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:38,291
- WHAT ARE OUR COORDINATES?

186
00:15:38,375 --> 00:15:39,708
- LET'S SEE.

187
00:15:39,791 --> 00:15:43,833
WE'RE 12,183,728 POINT--
- ALL RIGHT, THAT'S ENOUGH.

188
00:15:43,916 --> 00:15:45,833
YOU'RE THE REAL ONE.

189
00:15:45,916 --> 00:15:49,708
THERE WERE TWO VINCENTS.
WHAT'S GOING ON?

190
00:16:04,291 --> 00:16:06,875
YOU'RE A PROXY, TOO.

191
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,250
- NO MATTER WHERE WE GO,
WE'LL NEVER BE ACCEPTED.

192
00:16:51,166 --> 00:16:54,166
THIS IS MY TERRITORY.

193
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:57,708
AN ETERNITY OF SOLITUDE.

194
00:16:57,791 --> 00:17:00,000
WITHOUT COMMUNICATION.

195
00:17:00,083 --> 00:17:02,166
WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING.

196
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:04,250
WHY AM I THIS WAY?

197
00:17:04,333 --> 00:17:08,208
WHY CAN'T I BE SOMETHING WORTHY
OF LOVE AND ACCEPTANCE?

198
00:17:08,291 --> 00:17:12,416
I FOUND IF I PRETENDED
TO BE SOMEONE ELSE,

199
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:15,041
I COULD BE LOVED.

200
00:17:15,125 --> 00:17:17,875
BUT AFTER A WHILE I REALIZED

201
00:17:17,958 --> 00:17:20,750
THE PERSON THEY LOVED
WASN'T ME.

202
00:17:20,833 --> 00:17:22,333
I AM NO ONE,

203
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:25,416
THEREFORE I AM LOVED
BY NO ONE.

204
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:28,625
AND SO I DECIDED
TO END MYSELF.

205
00:17:30,791 --> 00:17:34,750
BUT EVEN IF WE WANT
TO END OURSELVES, WE CAN'T.

206
00:17:34,833 --> 00:17:36,500
SO WE ENDED THE OTHERS.

207
00:17:36,583 --> 00:17:40,375
FOR IN THEM WE FOUND REFLECTIONS
OF OURSELVES.

208
00:17:40,458 --> 00:17:42,791
IT DIDN'T WORK.

209
00:17:42,875 --> 00:17:45,416
IN THE END, THE ONLY ONE
LEFT WAS THE ONE WE WISHED

210
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:47,291
TO BE RID OF.

211
00:17:50,375 --> 00:17:53,458
THAT RADIANCE.

212
00:17:53,541 --> 00:17:57,791
THROUGH YOU,
I CAN FINALLY END MYSELF.

213
00:17:57,875 --> 00:18:01,541
LET'S US END IT,
YOU AND I TOGETHER.

214
00:18:01,625 --> 00:18:03,625
I'M NOT THE SAME AS YOU.

215
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:05,458
WE'RE BOTH ALONE.

216
00:18:05,541 --> 00:18:08,708
BOTH OF US HAVE
BEEN LEFT BEHIND.

217
00:18:08,791 --> 00:18:12,458
BUT THERE'S SOMETHING I NEED
TO KNOW BEFORE I'M FINISHED.

218
00:18:12,541 --> 00:18:17,416
- WHAT DO YOU NEED TO KNOW?
- I NEED TO KNOW WHAT I AM.

219
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:20,041
WE SAY THAT, AND YET
WE STAY HERE.

220
00:18:20,125 --> 00:18:23,541
WE STAY HERE
BECAUSE THE TRUTH SCARES US.

221
00:18:23,625 --> 00:18:24,875
- YOU'RE WRONG!

222
00:18:24,958 --> 00:18:28,166
- FROM BIRTH TO DEATH,
THE STORY EVOLVES.

223
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:31,125
THE COMPLETE PICTURE
OF WHO WE ARE IS ONLY CLEAR

224
00:18:31,208 --> 00:18:33,291
ONCE OUR STORY COMES
TO AN END.

225
00:18:33,375 --> 00:18:35,666
SO YOU MIGHT AS WELL
TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY

226
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:37,666
TO SKIP TO THE END.

227
00:18:59,333 --> 00:19:01,875
- RE-L...

228
00:19:01,958 --> 00:19:05,375
I'M SO HAPPY TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
- STAY BACK!

229
00:19:05,458 --> 00:19:07,583
- DON'T WORRY.
IT'S THE REAL ME.

230
00:19:07,666 --> 00:19:10,875
SO JUST ASK ME SOMETHING
THAT ONLY I WOULD KNOW.

231
00:19:10,958 --> 00:19:12,583
- I'M NOT GOING
ANY FURTHER WITH YOU.

232
00:19:12,666 --> 00:19:16,083
- BUT WHY?
- I'M SICK AND TIRED OF THIS.

233
00:19:16,166 --> 00:19:19,250
- HOW CAN YOU SAY THAT?
- DON'T MOVE!

234
00:19:19,333 --> 00:19:21,333
THIS IS GOODBYE, VINCENT.

235
00:19:21,416 --> 00:19:23,500
- IF YOU'RE GONNA LEAVE,

236
00:19:23,583 --> 00:19:25,958
PLEASE JUST KILL ME.

237
00:19:28,958 --> 00:19:31,875
- YOU UNDERSTAND NOW,
DON'T YOU?

238
00:19:31,958 --> 00:19:33,583
YOU DON'T GET TO BE
WITH ANYONE.

239
00:19:33,666 --> 00:19:37,416
THE BEST THING WE CAN DO FOR
EVERYONE IS DISAPPEAR FOREVER.

240
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,000
- JUST SHUT UP!

241
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:42,791
- LOOK.

242
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
- WHAT IS THIS?

243
00:19:49,083 --> 00:19:51,416
- OUR GRAVE.

244
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:54,458
- THEY'RE THE PEOPLE
FROM THIS TOWN?

245
00:19:54,541 --> 00:19:56,416
- SO THAT WE'RE NEVER LONELY.

246
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:59,750
- I'M GLAD
I DIDN'T BECOME LIKE YOU.

247
00:19:59,833 --> 00:20:02,000
- YOU'RE JUST LIKE ME.

248
00:20:02,083 --> 00:20:05,500
YOU BRING MISERY
TO THOSE AROUND YOU.

249
00:20:05,583 --> 00:20:07,166
THIS WAY IS BETTER.

250
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:09,708
THIS WAY THEY DON'T SUFFER.

251
00:20:19,458 --> 00:20:21,500
- RE-L.

252
00:20:21,583 --> 00:20:24,916
- STAY BACK.
- DON'T WORRY. IT'S THE REAL ME.

253
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,875
NO, WAIT.
THIS IS STILL HIS GAME.

254
00:20:27,958 --> 00:20:29,958
I'M NOT FALLING
FOR THIS AGAIN.

255
00:20:30,041 --> 00:20:31,958
- I CAN'T SEE ANYTHING.

256
00:20:32,041 --> 00:20:34,625
- BUT I'M CONFIDENT THAT
VINCE AND THE OTHER VINCE

257
00:20:34,708 --> 00:20:36,500
ARE BOTH IN HERE.

258
00:20:36,583 --> 00:20:39,625
- WHAT THE HELL'S
GOING ON DOWN THERE?

259
00:20:39,708 --> 00:20:40,708
- Pino: LOOK!

260
00:20:49,083 --> 00:20:50,500
- Vincent: RE-L.

261
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:52,583
- STAY BACK!

262
00:20:52,666 --> 00:20:54,625
- PLEASE, NOT AGAIN.

263
00:20:54,708 --> 00:20:58,000
- I'VE HAD ENOUGH.
- ( choking )

264
00:21:00,083 --> 00:21:01,875
- VINCE, STOP IT!

265
00:21:11,458 --> 00:21:14,291
- NOW YOU GOT WHAT YOU WANTED.

266
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,791
NO, IT'S NOT--

267
00:21:18,875 --> 00:21:21,333
IT'S NOT REAL.

268
00:21:21,416 --> 00:21:23,125
- ( screaming )
- PINO!

269
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,583
THIS--

270
00:21:27,666 --> 00:21:29,833
THIS WAS REAL?

271
00:21:29,916 --> 00:21:33,666
- SO LONG AS WE EXIST,
WE BRING NOTHING BUT MISERY.

272
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:37,500
- YOU DID THIS.
- WE DID THIS.

273
00:21:37,583 --> 00:21:40,041
- WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS TO ME?

274
00:21:40,125 --> 00:21:42,625
- IT PLEASES US TO DO SO.

275
00:21:42,708 --> 00:21:45,416
- I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO DO IF I'M ALONE.

276
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:48,416
- WE NEVER HAVE TO
BE ALONE.

277
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:51,250
COME ON, LET'S GO.

278
00:21:55,208 --> 00:21:56,666
- Pino: OVER THERE!

279
00:22:02,333 --> 00:22:05,625
- I'M AFRAID OF BEING ALONE.

280
00:22:05,708 --> 00:22:09,416
I'M AFRAID OF NOT KNOWING
WHAT I AM.

281
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:11,625
BUT WORSE,

282
00:22:11,708 --> 00:22:14,250
I'M AFRAID OF FINDING OUT.

283
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:16,875
THE PEOPLE I WANT
TO BE WITH WILL DIE

284
00:22:16,958 --> 00:22:19,500
BECAUSE THEY'RE WITH ME.

285
00:22:19,583 --> 00:22:22,208
IF THAT'S WHAT I AM,

286
00:22:22,291 --> 00:22:24,750
I MIGHT AS WELL DIE, TOO.

287
00:22:24,833 --> 00:22:26,750
- VINCE.

288
00:22:26,833 --> 00:22:29,000
- NO, DON'T GO!
YOU'LL DIE!

289
00:22:59,375 --> 00:23:02,250
IS IT YOU?  OR IT?

290
00:23:02,333 --> 00:23:05,500
ARE YOU JUST SOMETHING
THAT LOOKS LIKE VINCENT?

291
00:23:19,083 --> 00:23:21,208
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU'RE STILL WEARING THAT.

292
00:23:21,291 --> 00:23:22,833
- IT'S NOT LIKE
I CAN HELP IT.

293
00:23:22,916 --> 00:23:25,708
I MEAN, SOMEONE HAS
TO TAKE THE HELM.

294
00:23:25,791 --> 00:23:27,291
( sneezes )

295
00:23:27,375 --> 00:23:29,166
- WELL, I'M GLAD
YOU CAME BACK.

296
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:30,833
- HUH?

297
00:23:30,916 --> 00:23:33,333
- PINO AND I COULDN'T HAVE
RECOVERED THE SHIP WITHOUT YOU.

298
00:23:33,416 --> 00:23:36,166
- WELL, IT HELPED

299
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:39,166
THAT IT HADN'T DRIFTED
TOO FAR AWAY FROM US YET.

300
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:42,125
OH, AND THANKS A LOT.

301
00:23:42,208 --> 00:23:44,125
- FOR WHAT?
- FOR HAVING FAITH

302
00:23:44,208 --> 00:23:45,833
THAT IT WAS THE REAL ME.

303
00:23:45,916 --> 00:23:47,958
- IT'S BECAUSE THE IMPOSTER
DIDN'T LEAVE A REFLECTION

304
00:23:48,041 --> 00:23:49,833
ON THE WATER.
- HUH?

305
00:23:49,916 --> 00:23:52,708
- YOU MUST HAVE NOTICED THAT,
TOO, RIGHT?

306
00:23:55,791 --> 00:23:59,625
- THE PROXY HOPED TO FIND
ACCEPTANCE FROM OTHERS

307
00:23:59,708 --> 00:24:03,625
BY CHANGING HIS APPEARANCE
TO FILL THEIR NEEDS.

308
00:24:03,708 --> 00:24:07,458
I USED TO THINK ALONG
SIMILAR LINES TO THAT.

309
00:24:07,541 --> 00:24:10,375
BUT THEN I MET RE-L
AND PINO,

310
00:24:10,458 --> 00:24:13,500
AND THEY CAME WITH ME
ON THIS JOURNEY.

311
00:24:13,583 --> 00:24:17,625
AND WITH THEM, I CAN MAYBE
CHANGE WHO I REALLY AM.

312
00:24:17,708 --> 00:24:20,125
AND IF I CHANGE,

313
00:24:20,208 --> 00:24:24,125
MAYBE MY UNDERSTANDING
OF LIFE WILL CHANGE AS WELL.

314
00:24:24,208 --> 00:24:27,500
BECAUSE OF THAT,
I COULD NEVER LET MYSELF DIE,

315
00:24:27,583 --> 00:24:30,291
EVEN IF I AM A PROXY.

316
00:24:50,458 --> 00:24:54,291
- ♪ PLEASE COULD YOU
STOP THE NOISE? ♪

317
00:24:54,375 --> 00:24:59,250
