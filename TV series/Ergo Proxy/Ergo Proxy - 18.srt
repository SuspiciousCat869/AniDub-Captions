- ( wind whistling )

2
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:16,458
- YOU COULD HAVE
WAITED INSIDE.

3
00:01:16,541 --> 00:01:18,750
- I WANTED TO SEE
FOR MYSELF.

4
00:01:18,833 --> 00:01:20,833
FINALLY AT THE END
OF THE LINE.

5
00:01:23,125 --> 00:01:25,000
HOME AT LAST, HUH?

6
00:01:26,583 --> 00:01:27,875
- YEAH.

7
00:01:29,541 --> 00:01:32,708
- IT'S TIME WE FOUND OUT
WHAT YOU REALLY ARE.

8
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:40,125
YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY ONE
WHO'S NERVOUS, VINCENT.

9
00:01:40,208 --> 00:01:41,666
- RE-L.

10
00:01:43,458 --> 00:01:45,916
- ( wood groaning )
- ( grunting )

11
00:01:50,583 --> 00:01:51,708
VINCENT!

12
00:02:15,791 --> 00:02:18,375
- IT'S ALL GONE.

13
00:02:33,291 --> 00:02:35,833
- ( rock music playing )

00:02:48,916 --> 00:02:52,666

- Pino: THERE'S NOTHING HERE.

26
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:27,166
- ( Re-L's voice ) I CAN'T
BELIEVE THEY PUSHED IT THIS FAR.

27
00:04:30,125 --> 00:04:34,000
ROMDEAU COMPLETELY DESTROYED
THE CITY OF MOSK.

28
00:04:34,083 --> 00:04:37,458
I WONDER WHAT VINCENT WOULD DO
IF HE KNEW.

29
00:04:37,541 --> 00:04:39,750
- THAT LIGHT--

30
00:04:39,833 --> 00:04:43,166
I THINK THAT LIGHT WAS SENT
TO BURN MOSK TO THE GROUND.

31
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:45,666
SOMEONE WANTS
TO DESTROY MY PAST.

32
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:49,041
- NO, THIS PLACE LOOKS LIKE IT'S
BEEN THIS WAY FOR QUITE A WHILE.

33
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:54,208
- ( Re-L's voice )
OH, THAT'S RIGHT--

34
00:04:54,291 --> 00:04:56,541
GRANDFATHER MUST HAVE SENT
THE LIGHT.

35
00:04:58,416 --> 00:05:00,333
BUT WHY NOW?

36
00:05:00,416 --> 00:05:02,958
IS HE TRYING TO CATCH
ANOTHER PROXY?

37
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:06,833
WHAT'S GOING ON
IN ROMDEAU?

38
00:05:06,916 --> 00:05:09,375
- VINCE, DON'T BE GRUMPY.

39
00:05:09,458 --> 00:05:11,583
- OH, SORRY.

40
00:05:11,666 --> 00:05:13,666
- COME ON, WE ONLY JUST
GOT HERE.

41
00:05:15,791 --> 00:05:17,166
- YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.

42
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,666
- CITIZEN NUMBER 039666,

43
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:29,125
RAUL CREED.

44
00:05:30,333 --> 00:05:32,000
- PRESENT.

45
00:05:32,083 --> 00:05:34,583
- Derrida: HOW COULD
A MODEL CITIZEN

46
00:05:34,666 --> 00:05:36,875
HAVE PERFORMED
SO POORLY?

47
00:05:36,958 --> 00:05:40,208
- Lacan: YOU GREATLY
OVERESTIMATED YOUR ABILITIES.

48
00:05:40,291 --> 00:05:43,083
- Berkeley: TO HAVE TAKEN
SUCH LIBERTIES WITH THE SYSTEM.

49
00:05:43,166 --> 00:05:46,041
- Lacan: IF ONLY YOU HADN'T MADE
THIS DREADFUL MISTAKE.

50
00:05:46,125 --> 00:05:48,625
- SO IT'S MY MISTAKE?

51
00:05:48,708 --> 00:05:51,083
IF IT'S MY MISTAKE,
IT'S YOUR FAILURE.

52
00:05:52,875 --> 00:05:56,958
- Husserl: REFUSING TO TAKE
RESPONSIBILITY-- HOW TYPICAL.

53
00:05:57,041 --> 00:05:58,958
- Derrida: HOW TYPICAL.

54
00:05:59,041 --> 00:06:01,250
HOW UTTERLY BANAL.

55
00:06:01,333 --> 00:06:04,416
- THEN WHY DON'T YOU TELL ME,
IF IT WASN'T A FAILURE,

56
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:07,041
WHY MUST WE STILL ATONE
FOR ACCEPTING THE IMMIGRANTS?

57
00:06:07,125 --> 00:06:09,458
- Lacan: IT IS A FELLOW
CITIZEN'S DUTY

58
00:06:09,541 --> 00:06:11,541
TO REACH OUT
TO THE WEAK.

59
00:06:11,625 --> 00:06:13,833
- AND IT'S THAT SORT
OF UTTER RECKLESSNESS

60
00:06:13,916 --> 00:06:15,833
THAT LEADS
TO THIS PREDICAMENT.

61
00:06:15,916 --> 00:06:18,083
EVERYTHING THAT'S LEAD US
TO WHERE WE ARE TODAY

62
00:06:18,166 --> 00:06:20,875
BEGAN WITH THE ADMITTANCE
OF THE IMMIGRANT VINCENT LAW.

63
00:06:20,958 --> 00:06:22,416
DO YOU DISPUTE THAT?

64
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,500
- ( breathing heavily )

65
00:06:28,125 --> 00:06:29,791
- ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

66
00:06:29,875 --> 00:06:31,458
- YEAH.

67
00:06:31,541 --> 00:06:34,125
- THIS LOOKS LIKE IT USED TO BE
THE DOME CITY CENTER.

68
00:06:34,208 --> 00:06:36,458
- YEAH, MAYBE.

69
00:06:36,541 --> 00:06:39,708
- WHAT KIND OF CITIZEN DOESN'T
KNOW HIS OWN CITY CENTER?

70
00:06:39,791 --> 00:06:41,666
- I DON'T KNOW.

71
00:06:43,708 --> 00:06:46,666
- THAT'S A JOKE.
- YEAH, I KNOW THAT.

72
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:49,791
- WHAT'S WRONG?
- MAYBE SOMETHING YOU ATE

73
00:06:49,875 --> 00:06:52,541
OR SOMEONE YOU MIGHT HAVE MET
HERE-- ANYTHING MIGHT HELP.

74
00:06:52,625 --> 00:06:55,666
THINK.
- NO.

75
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:57,666
- TAKE YOUR TIME.

76
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:00,416
NOBODY'S ASKING YOU
TO PUSH YOURSELF RIGHT NOW.

77
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:02,416
- ( panting )

78
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:04,541
- COME ON, LET'S GO.

79
00:07:04,625 --> 00:07:06,541
- CAN I--

80
00:07:06,625 --> 00:07:09,000
CAN I HAVE A MOMENT
TO MYSELF, PLEASE?

81
00:07:09,083 --> 00:07:10,291
- HEY, VINCENT...

82
00:07:12,708 --> 00:07:15,875
IF YOU'RE NOT FEELING ALL RIGHT,
THEN JUST GO BACK TO THE SHIP.

83
00:07:15,958 --> 00:07:18,875
IF I FIND ANY CLUES OUT HERE,
I PROMISE TO COME TELL YOU.

84
00:07:18,958 --> 00:07:20,375
- OKAY.

85
00:07:22,833 --> 00:07:26,666
- Derrida: ACTIVATING RAPTURE
WAS NOT YOUR CRIME.

86
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:28,958
- Raul: YOU SET ASIDE
AN ANCIENT THERMONUCLEAR DEVICE

87
00:07:29,041 --> 00:07:31,583
FOR WHO KNOWS WHAT FOOLISHNESS.
THEN YOU PROCEEDED

88
00:07:31,666 --> 00:07:34,583
TO GIVE IT A CRIMINALLY
RIDICULOUS NICKNAME "RAPTURE."

89
00:07:34,666 --> 00:07:36,875
I'M AMAZED IT TOOK THIS LONG
FOR SOMETHING TO GO WRONG.

90
00:07:36,958 --> 00:07:39,375
- Berkeley: IT IS THE REPETITION
OF PAST SINS

91
00:07:39,458 --> 00:07:42,083
WHICH MARK YOUR CRIMES.

92
00:07:42,166 --> 00:07:45,708
- YOU HAVE SPENT YOUR EXISTENCE
SEEKING A GOD WHO BETRAYED YOU.

93
00:07:45,791 --> 00:07:48,000
I AM FREE
OF YOUR ILLUSIONS.

94
00:07:48,083 --> 00:07:50,375
I SEEK NO GOD
AND ASK FOR NO SALVATION.

95
00:07:50,458 --> 00:07:52,291
I ONLY WISH
TO DESTROY.

96
00:07:52,375 --> 00:07:54,875
- Lacan: YOU SEEK
FURTHER DESTRUCTION?

97
00:07:54,958 --> 00:07:57,333
- Derrida: HOW WILL
BRINGING DEATH AND ANARCHY

98
00:07:57,416 --> 00:07:59,625
TO THIS WORLD
CHANGE ANYTHING?

99
00:07:59,708 --> 00:08:03,083
- IF A CONFLICT HAS A WINNER,
THEN THERE MUST ALSO BE A LOSER.

100
00:08:03,166 --> 00:08:06,166
EVEN IF OUR ULTIMATE DOWNFALL
IS INEVITABLE,

101
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:09,458
ROMDEAU WILL NOT PERISH AS LONG
AS WE ARE WILLING TO FIGHT.

102
00:08:09,541 --> 00:08:10,708
- Lacan: YOU FOOL.

103
00:08:10,791 --> 00:08:13,416
- Husserl: THERE IS NO ESCAPE
FROM DESTINY.

104
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,666
- Berkeley: YOU SEEK
TO DENY DESTINY

105
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:18,541
BY HASTENING DESTRUCTION.

106
00:08:18,625 --> 00:08:21,375
- TO SIT BY AND WAIT
IS A SLOW SUICIDE.

107
00:08:21,458 --> 00:08:25,041
IT'S TEMPTING TO DROWN ONESELF
IN SOOTHING WAVES OF DESPAIR.

108
00:08:25,125 --> 00:08:29,166
AND YET WE MUST EVOLVE.
WE HAVE NO CHOICE!

109
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:31,750
WE MUST ALL LEARN TO DO
WITHOUT GOD FROM NOW ON.

110
00:08:31,833 --> 00:08:33,833
I WILL NOT DESPAIR.

111
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:45,833
- Lacan: RESIST FOR ROMDEAU--
IS THAT IT?

112
00:08:53,791 --> 00:08:57,791
- Derrida: GO AHEAD,
TRY IT YOUR WAY THEN.

113
00:08:57,875 --> 00:09:00,333
- YOU'RE NOT GOING TO
EXECUTE ME?

114
00:09:00,416 --> 00:09:04,250
YOU HOPE I WILL SHARE
IN YOUR SUFFERING.

115
00:09:06,208 --> 00:09:10,625
LET'S GO.
- YES, CHIEF.

116
00:09:14,083 --> 00:09:18,458
- Derrida: RAUL,
SOON YOU WILL KNOW...

117
00:09:18,541 --> 00:09:20,458
- Lacan: THE GREATEST
DEPTHS...

118
00:09:20,541 --> 00:09:23,250
- Husserl: THE CRUSHING
FAILURE...

119
00:09:23,333 --> 00:09:26,250
- Berkeley: THAT WHICH IS
OUR DESPAIR.

120
00:09:28,666 --> 00:09:31,875
- ( Vincent's voice )
THE CITY'S COMPLETELY DESTROYED,

121
00:09:31,958 --> 00:09:34,208
JUST LIKE IN MY MEMORY,

122
00:09:34,291 --> 00:09:36,708
THE PLACE
WHERE I WAS BORN,

123
00:09:36,791 --> 00:09:39,166
WHERE I BECAME
WHAT I AM.

124
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:42,125
EVEN SO,
I CAN'T REMEMBER ANYTHING.

125
00:09:44,791 --> 00:09:47,083
IF I BECAME HIM,

126
00:09:47,166 --> 00:09:49,416
I WONDER
IF IT WOULD RETURN.

127
00:09:57,083 --> 00:09:59,583
- Re-L: DON'T FALL.

128
00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:02,000
- I'M FINE.

129
00:10:02,083 --> 00:10:04,791
HEY, VINCE!

130
00:10:04,875 --> 00:10:07,541
HEY!

131
00:10:07,625 --> 00:10:09,541
HEY, VINCE!

132
00:10:09,625 --> 00:10:11,541
- I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU CAN SEE HIM FROM THIS FAR.

133
00:10:11,625 --> 00:10:13,541
- HEY!

134
00:10:13,625 --> 00:10:15,541
- JUST LEAVE HIM ALONE
ALREADY.

135
00:10:20,458 --> 00:10:22,958
WHAT CAN YOU SEE
UP THERE?

136
00:10:23,041 --> 00:10:26,125
- I THINK IT'S THE EGG.
- THE EGG?

137
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:28,541
MM-HMM.
AND INSIDE THE EGG

138
00:10:28,625 --> 00:10:31,208
THERE ARE SUPPOSED TO BE
ALL SORTS OF PRECIOUS THINGS,

139
00:10:31,291 --> 00:10:35,583
LIKE CHILDREN AND FOOD
AND DREAMS-- STUFF LIKE THAT.

140
00:10:35,666 --> 00:10:37,208
- IS THAT FROM YOUR
PICTURE BOOK?

141
00:10:37,291 --> 00:10:39,666
- UH-UH, BUT IT'S THE FIRST TIME
I'VE SEEN IT.

142
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,916
- ( Re-L's voice )
IT WAS IMPORTANT ENOUGH

143
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,916
TO HAVE BEEN
VERY WELL-FORTIFIED.

144
00:10:46,541 --> 00:10:49,125
- Daedalus: WE CALLED IT
THE MONAD PROXY.

145
00:10:49,208 --> 00:10:50,750
- MONAD?

146
00:10:52,791 --> 00:10:57,333
- IT WAS PLUNDERED
FROM THE MOSK DOME.

147
00:10:57,416 --> 00:10:59,333
- ( Re-L's voice )
PERHAPS THIS IS WHERE

148
00:10:59,416 --> 00:11:01,708
THE MONAD PROXY
WAS KEPT.

149
00:11:04,958 --> 00:11:07,041
- ( breathing heavily )

150
00:11:09,833 --> 00:11:12,208
- ( Vincent's voice )
I CAN'T REMEMBER ANYTHING.

151
00:11:12,291 --> 00:11:14,708
WITHOUT A PAST,

152
00:11:14,791 --> 00:11:17,250
CAN I EVEN PROVE
I EXIST?

153
00:11:21,833 --> 00:11:24,541
- THERE'S SOMETHING THERE.

154
00:11:25,791 --> 00:11:28,750
- DON'T WORRY.
- THIS PLACE IS SCARY.

155
00:11:28,833 --> 00:11:31,791
- I HAVE THIS STRANGE FEELING
I'VE BEEN HERE BEFORE.

156
00:11:31,875 --> 00:11:33,291
- HMM?

157
00:11:33,375 --> 00:11:36,625
- IT'S KINDA-- IT LOOKS LIKE
MY GRANDFATHER'S ROOM.

158
00:11:36,708 --> 00:11:40,041
I WAS SO NERVOUS EVERY TIME
I WAS SUMMONED THERE.

159
00:11:40,125 --> 00:11:42,666
IT FEELS
ALMOST NOSTALGIC NOW.

160
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:45,125
- WAS YOUR GRANDFATHER
A NICE MAN?

161
00:11:45,208 --> 00:11:46,416
- NO.

162
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:48,833
- I'M SO SORRY, RE-L.

163
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,291
- DID THEY KEEP
A PROXY HERE?

164
00:12:04,375 --> 00:12:06,791
- ( Re-L's voice )
ROMDEAU INVADED MOSK

165
00:12:06,875 --> 00:12:09,333
AND THEY TOOK THE MONAD PROXY
BY FORCE.

166
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,416
WHY CAN'T WE LIVE
WITHOUT A PROXY?

167
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:29,208
WHY DID ROMDEAU HAVE TO STEAL
A PROXY FROM SOMEONE ELSE?

168
00:12:32,041 --> 00:12:34,875
WHAT DID THE PROXY SEE
FROM UP HERE?

169
00:12:47,916 --> 00:12:52,041
- ( gasps )
THE PULSE.

170
00:12:52,125 --> 00:12:55,041
- WHY DO YOU THINK
VINCE FORGOT EVERYTHING?

171
00:12:55,125 --> 00:12:57,750
I WOULDN'T HAVE
FORGOTTEN.

172
00:12:57,833 --> 00:12:59,250
- PEOPLE ARE DIFFERENT
FROM YOU.

173
00:12:59,333 --> 00:13:01,875
WE'D GO CRAZY IF WE HAD
TO REMEMBER EVERYTHING.

174
00:13:01,958 --> 00:13:04,500
- VINCE HAD A REALLY
HARD TIME, DIDN'T HE?

175
00:13:04,583 --> 00:13:06,666
- MAYBE FORGETTING

176
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:10,458
WAS THE ONLY WAY HIS MIND
COULD PROTECT ITSELF.

177
00:13:10,541 --> 00:13:13,208
BUT IF HIS MEMORY
HOLDS THE TRUTH...

178
00:13:15,333 --> 00:13:17,750
IF ONLY WE HAD
A POWER SUPPLY.

179
00:13:17,833 --> 00:13:19,750
- POWER?

180
00:13:19,833 --> 00:13:22,208
- LIKE THOSE PORTS WE USE
TO CHARGE YOUR BATTERY.

181
00:13:22,291 --> 00:13:24,750
- THERE'S ONE HERE.
- WHAT?

182
00:13:24,833 --> 00:13:28,708
- THERE'S POWER HERE.
- WHY DIDN'T YOU SAY SOMETHING?

183
00:13:28,791 --> 00:13:30,666
- WHY DIDN'T YOU
ASK ME?

184
00:13:39,458 --> 00:13:41,333
- I DID IT.

185
00:13:43,625 --> 00:13:46,875
SHIT.
OR NOT.

186
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:49,833
- I THINK I KNOW
WHAT WE'RE SUPPOSED TO DO.

187
00:14:01,875 --> 00:14:03,833
- ( gasps )
YOU'RE THE ONE

188
00:14:03,916 --> 00:14:06,708
WHO'S ALLOWED
TO OPEN THE DOOR.

189
00:14:06,791 --> 00:14:09,208
YES, I REMEMBER YOU.

190
00:14:09,291 --> 00:14:12,416
I'VE BEEN WAITING
FOR YOU,

191
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,875
MY HONORED GUEST.

192
00:14:24,708 --> 00:14:27,416
- WHAT DID YOU GAIN
FROM ERASING YOUR MEMORY

193
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,416
AND LEAVING
THIS PLACE?

194
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:33,458
YOU DIDN'T GAIN ANYTHING,
DID YOU?

195
00:14:33,541 --> 00:14:36,416
THAT'S WHY YOU CAME
RUNNING BACK.

196
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,416
OH, DEAR.
( chuckles )

197
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:40,416
WITH YOUR PERMISSION,
I'M AMNESIA.

198
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:43,625
I'M THE ONE YOU ASKED TO BE
THE WATCHMAN OF YOUR MEMORIES,

199
00:14:43,708 --> 00:14:45,958
KEEPER FOR THIS VERY--

200
00:14:46,041 --> 00:14:48,375
WELL, UNTIL
SOMETHING LIKE THIS.

201
00:14:48,458 --> 00:14:51,916
DON'T TELL ME
YOU'VE FORGOTTEN THAT TOO.

202
00:14:54,333 --> 00:14:56,625
HMM, WELL, OKAY.

203
00:14:58,208 --> 00:14:59,916
LET'S DO THIS:

204
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,875
THAT WHICH IS DIVIDED
MUST BECOME ONE.

205
00:15:05,375 --> 00:15:07,750
HERE ARE
THE PRECIOUS MEMORIES

206
00:15:07,833 --> 00:15:10,375
YOU ENTRUSTED ME WITH,
MASTER.

207
00:15:10,458 --> 00:15:12,958
I WAS WORRIED THAT THEY WERE
BECOMING INDISTINCT,

208
00:15:13,041 --> 00:15:14,875
SO I WROTE
THEM ALL DOWN--

209
00:15:14,958 --> 00:15:17,625
YOU KNOW,
WAIT AND TELL.

210
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:20,000
IF I WERE
A SIMPLE MACHINE,

211
00:15:20,083 --> 00:15:22,666
ALL OF THIS WOULD BE
SO MUCH EASIER.

212
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:24,375
( chuckles )

213
00:15:24,458 --> 00:15:26,833
CONSCIOUS ENTITIES WILL
SOMETIMES AMPUTATE

214
00:15:26,916 --> 00:15:30,416
THEIR MEMORIES TO SAVE
A FAILING SENSE OF SANITY.

215
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:34,500
DEMENTIA OR AMNESIA--
TAKE YOUR PICK.

216
00:15:34,583 --> 00:15:37,958
( chuckles ) THANK GOD WE MET
BEFORE IT EVER CAME TO THAT.

217
00:15:38,041 --> 00:15:40,291
YES, YES, I KNOW.

218
00:15:40,375 --> 00:15:42,750
BEAR WITH ME
FOR ANOTHER MINUTE.

219
00:15:50,791 --> 00:15:52,916
YES.

220
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,833
THIS IS INTERESTING.
THIS IS THE PART

221
00:15:55,916 --> 00:15:58,916
THAT TELLS THE STORY
OF HOW YOU MET HER.

222
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:03,166
NOW THEN,
WITHOUT FURTHER ADO--

223
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:05,458
OH.

224
00:16:05,541 --> 00:16:07,458
DON'T WORRY.
DON'T WORRY.

225
00:16:07,541 --> 00:16:09,916
I WOULD NEVER EVER ALLOW
ANYTHING TO HAPPEN

226
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,333
TO ANY OF THE PRECIOUS MEMORIES
YOU ENTRUSTED TO ME.

227
00:16:13,416 --> 00:16:16,125
IT'S JUST
SOMETHING STRANGE--

228
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:18,125
I MEAN,
NO, DON'T WORRY.

229
00:16:18,208 --> 00:16:21,041
I WROTE IT ALL DOWN
VERY PRECISELY OVER AND OVER.

230
00:16:21,125 --> 00:16:23,041
NOTHING'S BEEN FORGOTTEN.

231
00:16:23,125 --> 00:16:25,458
I'VE SPENT DAYS AND NIGHTS
AT A TIME

232
00:16:25,541 --> 00:16:27,708
WRITING DOWN
THESE MEMO--

233
00:16:27,791 --> 00:16:29,708
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

234
00:16:29,791 --> 00:16:33,458
YOU'RE HURTING
THE MEMORIES.

235
00:16:33,541 --> 00:16:35,458
WHY DID YOU RETURN?

236
00:16:35,541 --> 00:16:37,458
WHY DID I HAVE
TO KEEP THEM SAFE?

237
00:16:37,541 --> 00:16:39,875
( grunts ) WHY?

238
00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:41,416
WHY?

239
00:16:47,583 --> 00:16:49,416
WHY?

240
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,750
- ( gasps )

241
00:17:06,833 --> 00:17:08,916
( panting )

242
00:17:10,583 --> 00:17:12,541
- VINCE.

243
00:17:12,625 --> 00:17:14,250
- PINO.

244
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:17,375
- RE-L, VINCE IS AWAKE!

245
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:24,375
- HOW ARE YOU FEELING?

246
00:17:24,458 --> 00:17:26,500
- MUCH BETTER, THANKS.

247
00:17:26,583 --> 00:17:28,500
- I THINK
WE FOUND A LEAD.

248
00:17:28,583 --> 00:17:30,500
- I GOT IT IN MY HEAD.

249
00:17:30,583 --> 00:17:32,541
- THERE'S AN OPERATIONAL
POWER PLANT WE FOUND

250
00:17:32,625 --> 00:17:35,333
UNDERNEATH THE CITY.
ARE YOU UP FOR A TRIP?

251
00:17:35,416 --> 00:17:38,625
- SO HOW LONG HAVE I BEEN
SLEEPING FOR?

252
00:17:38,708 --> 00:17:41,333
- ( sighs )
LET'S GO.

253
00:17:45,541 --> 00:17:49,166
- Raul: I WANT YOU TO MAKE THIS
YOUR TOP PRIORITY.

254
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:52,125
- DO I PUT THIS AHEAD OF
REVIVING THE PROXY?

255
00:17:52,208 --> 00:17:55,041
- THE LAST THING WE NEED
IS ANOTHER GOD.

256
00:17:55,125 --> 00:17:56,416
- HMM.

257
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:58,666
- YOU'RE NOT SCARED,
ARE YOU?

258
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:02,125
- I JUST DON'T THINK GETTING RID
OF GOD WILL CHANGE ANYTHING.

259
00:18:02,208 --> 00:18:04,875
- EXACTLY.
IT DOESN'T CHANGE ANYTHING.

260
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:08,125
WE NEED TO MANIFEST CHANGE
DOWN TO THE CELLULAR LEVEL.

261
00:18:08,208 --> 00:18:10,458
I'M SURE
YOU'LL FIGURE IT OUT.

262
00:18:10,541 --> 00:18:13,833
YOU KNOW EVERYONE HAS EXPRESSED
NOTHING BUT FAITH IN YOU.

263
00:18:13,916 --> 00:18:16,541
- YOU'RE A VERY ODD MAN,

264
00:18:16,625 --> 00:18:19,000
GOING TO SUCH
RIDICULOUS LENGTHS.

265
00:18:19,083 --> 00:18:22,541
- I JUST WANT A REVOLUTION.
WILL YOU HELP USHER MAN

266
00:18:22,625 --> 00:18:25,000
INTO THE SUBLIME STATE
WE WERE MEANT TO HOLD?

267
00:18:25,083 --> 00:18:27,000
- ALL RIGHT.

268
00:18:27,083 --> 00:18:29,166
- IF YOU DESIRE
ANYTHING

269
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:31,333
WITHIN ROMDEAU,
I'LL HAVE IT DELIVERED.

270
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:40,791
HMM?

271
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:47,625
A BALL OF RED STRING?

272
00:18:52,208 --> 00:18:54,875
- GIVE IT BACK, PLEASE.

273
00:18:54,958 --> 00:18:56,916
- SURE.

274
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,166
- THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT.

275
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:00,666
- IS IT?

276
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:01,791
- MM-HMM.

277
00:19:04,125 --> 00:19:05,750
- THANKS FOR WAITING.

278
00:19:07,291 --> 00:19:09,041
- WHAT IS THIS?

279
00:19:09,125 --> 00:19:11,416
ARE YOU TRYING TO REPLACE
RE-L MAYER?

280
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:13,208
- REPLACE?

281
00:19:13,291 --> 00:19:16,000
THIS IS RE-L MAYER.

282
00:19:16,083 --> 00:19:18,250
RE-L, LET'S GO.
COME ON.

283
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:30,833
- HE'S STARTING TO CRACK.

284
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:35,083
- COME ON, HURRY.

285
00:19:35,166 --> 00:19:37,500
- IT SEEMS THIS SECTION

286
00:19:37,583 --> 00:19:40,833
HAS AN ENERGY RESERVE BUILT IN
TO WITHSTAND CATASTROPHES.

287
00:19:40,916 --> 00:19:43,041
- THIS PLACE--

288
00:19:43,125 --> 00:19:45,291
- YOU'RE STARTING
TO REMEMBER SOMETHING?

289
00:19:45,375 --> 00:19:47,625
- NO, IT'S MORE LIKE--

290
00:19:47,708 --> 00:19:49,208
IT'S LIKE

291
00:19:49,291 --> 00:19:51,791
I KNOW THAT I'VE BEEN
HERE BEFORE.

292
00:19:54,333 --> 00:19:57,041
- IT'S ALL COVERED
IN WRITING.

293
00:19:57,125 --> 00:19:58,708
CAN YOU READ IT?

294
00:19:58,791 --> 00:20:00,708
- SORRY.

295
00:20:00,791 --> 00:20:03,250
- ( grunts )

296
00:20:03,333 --> 00:20:04,750
- LET'S NOT.

297
00:20:04,833 --> 00:20:06,750
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT MIGHT BE
INSIDE THERE.

298
00:20:06,833 --> 00:20:09,916
- HEY, LOOK.
YOU HAVE THIS.

299
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,625
- IT'S THE SAME SHAPE
AS YOUR PENDANT.

300
00:20:12,708 --> 00:20:14,875
- IT CAN'T BE.

301
00:20:21,666 --> 00:20:23,583
- IT OPENED.

302
00:20:23,666 --> 00:20:25,541
- SO YOUR PENDANT
WAS REALLY A KEY.

303
00:20:28,541 --> 00:20:30,458
- THIS ROOM--

304
00:20:30,541 --> 00:20:32,791
IT'S WEIRD.

305
00:20:32,875 --> 00:20:34,458
- WHAT DO YOU THINK
IT WAS FOR?

306
00:20:34,541 --> 00:20:36,458
- HI.
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

307
00:20:36,541 --> 00:20:39,083
- Re-L: LEAVE IT ALONE.
IT'S BROKEN.

308
00:20:39,166 --> 00:20:41,166
- IS HE DEAD?

309
00:20:43,833 --> 00:20:45,250
- ( Pino exclaims )
- OW!

310
00:20:45,333 --> 00:20:47,500
- WHAT'S WRONG?
- Amnesia: ...MUST BECOME ONE.

311
00:20:47,583 --> 00:20:49,875
THAT WHICH IS DIVIDED

312
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:51,791
MUST BECOME ONE.

313
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:53,958
- THAT WHICH IS DIVIDED?

314
00:20:54,041 --> 00:20:57,416
- THAT WHICH IS DIVIDED
MUST BECOME ONE.

315
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:59,583
- SEE?  I TOLD YOU--
BROKEN.

316
00:20:59,666 --> 00:21:01,625
- WHAT DO YOU THINK
THAT IT MEANS?

317
00:21:01,708 --> 00:21:04,875
- THAT WHICH IS DIVIDED
MUST BECOME ONE.

318
00:21:06,916 --> 00:21:08,875
- VINCENT, LOOK.
- THAT WHICH IS DIVIDED...

319
00:21:08,958 --> 00:21:12,708
- IT'S UP THERE.
- ...MUST BECOME ONE.

320
00:21:12,791 --> 00:21:15,958
- RE-L, IS THAT--?
- THAT WHICH IS DIVIDED--

321
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:17,958
- TO ROMDEAU.  TO ROMDEAU.
- WHAT?

322
00:21:18,041 --> 00:21:21,500
- TO ROMDEAU.  TO ROMDEAU.
( powers down )

323
00:21:21,583 --> 00:21:23,583
- HE SAID ROMDEAU!
WOW.

324
00:21:23,666 --> 00:21:25,625
- HEY, YOU,
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

325
00:21:25,708 --> 00:21:29,083
HEY, SAY SOMETHING.

326
00:21:31,041 --> 00:21:33,791
OH.
- Re-L: WHAT?

327
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:43,083
- Pino: THEY MATCH.

328
00:21:50,583 --> 00:21:54,416
- YOU ARE TRULY ONE OF THE GREAT
MYSTERIES OF THE WORLD.

329
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:58,000
REMEMBER, YOU MUST NEVER SHOW
THAT SMILE TO ANOTHER MAN.

330
00:21:58,083 --> 00:21:59,833
- MM-HMM.

331
00:22:06,875 --> 00:22:09,250
- BEAUTIFUL.

332
00:22:10,416 --> 00:22:12,791
SO YOU'RE STILL HERE.

333
00:22:15,083 --> 00:22:18,125
I WAS SURE
I'D FINALLY KILLED YOU.

334
00:22:18,208 --> 00:22:21,750
BUT YOU'RE JUST A SYMBOL OF
WHAT I'M FIGHTING, AREN'T YOU?

335
00:22:21,833 --> 00:22:23,791
THAT'S FINE.

336
00:22:23,875 --> 00:22:26,083
I WILL DESTROY YOU
REGARDLESS,

337
00:22:26,166 --> 00:22:28,125
BECAUSE I AM NOT
AFRAID OF YOU.

338
00:22:32,333 --> 00:22:35,458
- Re-L: MAYBE IT WAS A MESSAGE
TO YOU FROM MONAD.

339
00:22:35,541 --> 00:22:37,916
- Vincent: MONAD.

340
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,583
- THEN IT MUST BE MONAD.

341
00:22:40,666 --> 00:22:42,875
YOU MUST HAVE TRANSFERRED
YOUR MEMORIES TO MONAD.

342
00:22:44,125 --> 00:22:46,875
BECAUSE MONAD LOVED YOU.

343
00:22:46,958 --> 00:22:48,875
- A DEAD END,

344
00:22:48,958 --> 00:22:50,708
AFTER ALL
WE'VE BEEN THROUGH.

345
00:22:50,791 --> 00:22:53,833
- NO.  NOW WE KNOW
WHERE WE'RE SUPPOSED TO GO.

346
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,416
I'VE SEEN
THIS MESSAGE BEFORE,

347
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:58,625
BACK IN ROMDEAU.

348
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:01,666
IT WAS ON THE MIRROR

349
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:04,041
DURING THE NIGHT I FIRST SAW YOU
IN YOUR PROXY FORM.

350
00:23:11,958 --> 00:23:13,500
THAT'S WHY.

351
00:23:13,583 --> 00:23:15,875
- WE GO BACK TO ROMDEAU.

352
00:23:15,958 --> 00:23:18,208
- CAN WE MAKE IT?

353
00:23:18,291 --> 00:23:19,791
- WE HAVE TO.

354
00:23:19,875 --> 00:23:23,458
- ( Re-L's voice )
VINCENT LAW, WHAT ARE YOU?

355
00:23:25,541 --> 00:23:27,458
ANOTHER PENDANT.

356
00:23:27,541 --> 00:23:29,708
WHAT WAS ANOTHER PENDANT
DOING HERE?

357
00:23:31,041 --> 00:23:35,041
- Amnesia: THAT WHICH IS DIVIDED
MUST BECOME ONE.

358
00:23:35,125 --> 00:23:37,458
- IS THAT SUPPOSED TO BE

359
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:39,750
VINCENT AND ERGO?

360
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:44,625
AND IF IT IS, THEN WHOEVER
BROKE THE AUTOREIV

361
00:23:44,708 --> 00:23:46,250
AND STOLE
THE MEMORIES WAS--

362
00:23:46,333 --> 00:23:48,666
- ( gasps )

363
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:51,666
- IT'S TIME.
LET'S GO.

364
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:54,458
- RIGHT.

365
00:23:58,333 --> 00:24:01,208
- I GUESS
WE ALL GOTTA GO BACK.

366
00:24:02,916 --> 00:24:06,500
- ( Re-L's voice ) NOW TO
THE LAST STOP ON OUR JOURNEY.

367
00:24:06,583 --> 00:24:09,125
WE'VE ENCOUNTERED
MANY PROXIES,

368
00:24:09,208 --> 00:24:11,791
BUT NONE OF THEM WERE
THE ONE WE'RE LOOKING FOR.

369
00:24:13,416 --> 00:24:16,541
MONAD WAS RESPONSIBLE
FOR EVERYTHING.

370
00:24:16,625 --> 00:24:18,916
THE MESSAGE,
LIKE A THREAD

371
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,333
LINKING THE TWO
PENDANTS--

372
00:24:22,416 --> 00:24:24,625
THE CONNECTION
BETWEEN MONAD AND VINCENT

373
00:24:24,708 --> 00:24:27,208
AND THE PROXY--

374
00:24:27,291 --> 00:24:31,000
THE ANSWER LIES THERE.
I KNOW IT.

THE KINGDOM
OF ETERNAL HAPPINESS.

383

ALL WHO ENTER ARE TAKEN
