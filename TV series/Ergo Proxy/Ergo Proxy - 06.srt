OF COURSE WE DIDN'T STEAL IT.

76

WE TOOK IT FROM HOODY
AND HE STOLE IT FIRST.

IT'S QUINN'S IDEA.

I WON'T LET YOU
HAVE HIM.

94
00:08:23,791 --> 00:08:26,541
- SO THEN,
WHAT'S IT GOING TO BE--

95
00:08:26,625 --> 00:08:28,416
HIM OR THE VEHICLE?

96
00:08:29,791 --> 00:08:32,375
YOU DON'T LOOK SO HOT,
PRINCESS.

97
00:08:36,833 --> 00:08:38,291
- RE-L.

98

- Quinn: HOODY DOESN'T HAVE
ANY VACCINE.

101
00:08:53,958 --> 00:08:56,916
HE RAN OUT OF THE STUFF
A LONG TIME AGO.

102
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,916
HE JUST HASN'T BOTHERED
TO TELL ANYONE YET.

103
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,291
- BUT HE HEALED ME
BEFORE.

104
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:05,583
- SO YOU THINK HE CURED YOU?
WELL, YOU'RE WRONG.

105
00:09:05,666 --> 00:09:07,958
YOU JUST MANAGED
TO GET BETTER ON YOUR OWN.

106
00:09:08,041 --> 00:09:10,666
- SO THE MEDICINE
IS ALL GONE?

107
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:12,333
- ALMOST.

108
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:16,166
- IS THAT IT?
- OUR LAST VIAL.

109
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:18,291
AND I'M NOT
GIVING IT AWAY FOR FREE.

110
00:09:18,375 --> 00:09:19,958
YOU GET THE VIAL

111
00:09:20,041 --> 00:09:22,291
IF YOU AND THE GIRL
JOIN US ON THE RABBIT.

112
00:09:22,375 --> 00:09:24,750
DON'T MAKE THAT FACE
AT ME.

113
00:09:24,833 --> 00:09:26,750
I'M OFFERING YOU
A CURE.

114
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:29,125
YOU'D BETTER SHOW
SOME APPRECIATION.

115
00:09:29,208 --> 00:09:32,458
AND AS FOR THE TRIP,
WELL, THE MORE THE MERRIER.

116
00:09:41,958 --> 00:09:44,375
- HOODY.
- YES, PINO?

117
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:46,375
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

118
00:09:46,458 --> 00:09:48,541
- I'M NOT DOING
ANYTHING, DEAR,

119
00:09:48,625 --> 00:09:51,125
NOTHING AT ALL.
- HMM.

120
00:09:51,208 --> 00:09:53,833
- YOU'RE LEAVING HERE.
ISN'T THAT RIGHT, PINO?

121
00:09:53,916 --> 00:09:56,041
- YEAH, I GUESS SO.

122
00:09:56,125 --> 00:09:59,333
- DON'T YOU WANT
TO GO BACK TO ROMDEAU?

123
00:09:59,416 --> 00:10:02,083
- NOT REALLY.
- WHY NOT?

124
00:10:02,166 --> 00:10:05,166
- BECAUSE I DON'T WANT
TO LEAVE VINCE.

125
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:07,666
OH, BUT PA--

126
00:10:09,416 --> 00:10:11,166
- MM?

127
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:14,500
- HUH-UH, IT'S NOTHING.

128
00:10:14,583 --> 00:10:17,166
HEY, HOODY.
- MM-HMM?

129
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:19,166
- DO YOU KNOW
WHERE TIMOTHY IS?

130
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:21,166
I'VE LOOKED ALL OVER,

131
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:23,500
BUT I CAN'T FIND HIM
ANYWHERE.

132
00:10:23,583 --> 00:10:25,541
- HASN'T ANYONE TOLD YOU?

133
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,041
TIMOTHY IS DEAD.

134
00:10:27,125 --> 00:10:28,666
- YES, I KNOW.

135
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:31,333
SO I'VE BEEN TRYING
TO FIND ANOTHER TIMOTHY.

136
00:10:31,416 --> 00:10:33,333
- PINO.

137
00:10:34,625 --> 00:10:37,333
WHEN A PERSON DIES,
THAT'S IT.

138
00:10:37,416 --> 00:10:39,708
YOU DON'T GET TO SEE
ANOTHER ONE OF THEM AGAIN.

139
00:10:39,791 --> 00:10:42,375
- WHAT?
REALLY?

140
00:10:42,458 --> 00:10:44,875
- THAT'S HOW IT WORKS.

141
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:47,250
- OKAY.

142
00:10:47,333 --> 00:10:50,375
BUT I STILL WANT
TO PLAY WITH HIM SOME MORE.

143
00:10:50,458 --> 00:10:53,583
- ARE YOU SAD, PINO?

144
00:10:53,666 --> 00:10:55,750
- AM I SAD?

145
00:10:55,833 --> 00:10:57,250
- YES, DEAR.

146
00:10:57,333 --> 00:10:59,208
WHAT YOU'RE FEELING
IN THERE RIGHT NOW--

147
00:10:59,291 --> 00:11:02,416
THAT IS WHAT WE CALL
BEING SAD.

148
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:09,791
- SAD.

149
00:11:11,125 --> 00:11:13,041
- DAMN.  AND AFTER
ALL WE WENT THROUGH

150
00:11:13,125 --> 00:11:15,875
JUST TO GET HER TO SHOW HERSELF.
- JUST BE PATIENT.

151
00:11:15,958 --> 00:11:17,916
WE'VE STILL GOT
HER VEHICLE SECURED,

152
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,916
SO SHE'S NOT
GOING ANYWHERE.

153
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,708
BESIDES, I'D STILL LIKE TO TRY
AND KEEP THE BOY HAPPY.

154
00:11:22,791 --> 00:11:25,625
- Older man: REALLY?
THAT DON'T SOUND LIKE YOU.

155
00:11:25,708 --> 00:11:28,416
- Younger man: WHAT, ARE YOU
AFRAID OF THE LITTLE SHRIMP?

156
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,666
- Quinn: I DON'T KNOW.
MAYBE.

157
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:33,208
- I GOT THE STUFF, QUINN.

158
00:11:33,291 --> 00:11:35,875
Men: WOW.
LOOK AT THAT HARDWARE.

159
00:11:35,958 --> 00:11:38,250
- LOOK AT THAT.
- WHOA, CAN YOU BELIEVE IT?

160
00:11:38,333 --> 00:11:40,916
LOOK HOW MUCH
THERE IS.

161
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,916
- THE SEEDS
HAVE BEEN SOWN.

162
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,333
NOW THERE'S NOTHING LEFT
EXCEPT TO WAIT.

163
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:51,500
- ( Vincent's voice )
I HAVE TO TAKE YOU WITH ME.

164
00:11:51,583 --> 00:11:53,958
THERE'S NO CHOICE.
- WHAT'S WRONG?

165
00:11:58,375 --> 00:12:00,791
- YOU'RE REALLY
GOING TO TAKE HER THEN?

166
00:12:00,875 --> 00:12:02,791
- WHAT CAN I DO?

167
00:12:02,875 --> 00:12:04,875
SHE'S NOT GONNA RECOVER
FROM THE INFECTION HERE.

168
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:06,541
- VINCENT, WHAT DO YOU THINK
THAT YOU'RE--?

169
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:10,250
- SHE'LL DIE.  AND YOU SHOULD
KNOW THAT BETTER THAN ANYONE.

170
00:12:10,333 --> 00:12:12,583
- SO YOU KNEW.

171
00:12:12,666 --> 00:12:15,916
- IF SHE AND I GET ON THE BOAT,
THEN WE GET THE VACCINE.

172
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,708
- AND YOU THINK
QUINN'S GOING TO HELP HER?

173
00:12:18,791 --> 00:12:20,708
YOU IDIOT.

174
00:12:20,791 --> 00:12:23,500
THAT GIRL'S FROM ROMDEAU--
THE CITY THAT KILLED TIMOTHY.

175
00:12:25,041 --> 00:12:26,958
ONCE THE RABBIT MANAGES
TO SET SAIL,

176
00:12:27,041 --> 00:12:29,291
THE DOME IS CERTAIN
TO TRY TO CHASE IT DOWN.

177
00:12:29,375 --> 00:12:31,875
IF QUINN USES THE GIRL
AS A SHIELD,

178
00:12:31,958 --> 00:12:35,458
THE DOME WON'T ATTACK.
BUT ONCE THEY'RE ACROSS THE BAY,

179
00:12:35,541 --> 00:12:38,833
THEN THE GIRL WON'T BE WORTH
ANYTHING TO QUINN ANYMORE.

180
00:12:38,916 --> 00:12:41,333
QUINN IS LYING TO YOU,
VINCENT.

181
00:12:41,416 --> 00:12:44,833
AND YOU ARE A FOOL
STUMBLING RIGHT INTO HER TRAP.

182
00:12:44,916 --> 00:12:46,833
- BUT WHAT ABOUT
THE VACCINE?

183
00:12:48,666 --> 00:12:51,125
- WHAT IF THE VACCINE
IS A FAKE?

184
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:54,416
AND EVEN IF THE VACCINE
WAS REAL,

185
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:56,416
IT STILL WOULDN'T MATTER.

186
00:12:56,500 --> 00:13:00,166
IN HER WEAKENED CONDITION,
THE COLD WOULD KILL HER.

187
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:02,458
- EVEN SO, I CAN'T JUST
SIT AND WAIT HERE.

188
00:13:02,541 --> 00:13:04,833
- HER TIME'S RUNNING OUT.

189
00:13:04,916 --> 00:13:07,333
- SO WHAT ARE YOU SAYING
I SHOULD DO?

190
00:13:07,416 --> 00:13:09,875
- TAKE HER BACK TO ROMDEAU.

191
00:13:09,958 --> 00:13:12,166
- TAKE HER BACK?

192
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:13,375
TO ROMDEAU?

193
00:13:13,458 --> 00:13:15,625
- IF YOU DON'T WANT HER
TO DIE,

194
00:13:15,708 --> 00:13:18,166
TAKING HER BACK TO ROMDEAU
IS YOUR ONLY CHANCE.

195
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:20,500
I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOU INSIDE THE DOME,

196
00:13:20,583 --> 00:13:23,666
BUT SHE CAME OUT HERE
LOOKING ONLY FOR YOU, VINCENT.

197
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:26,458
THEY THINK YOU'RE SOMETHING
SPECIAL.  YOU CAN GO BACK.

198
00:13:26,541 --> 00:13:29,208
THE MAN FROM ROMDEAU
MUST RETURN.

199
00:13:29,291 --> 00:13:33,416
IT'S PROVIDENCE.
TO RESIST IS TO FAIL.

200
00:13:35,416 --> 00:13:37,916
- SO WE RETURN TO ROMDEAU.

201
00:13:42,458 --> 00:13:45,041
- Man: QUINN, TAKE A LOOK.

202
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:47,333
- Both: QUINN.

203
00:13:49,541 --> 00:13:51,750
- NO, YOU CAN'T GO.

204
00:14:04,333 --> 00:14:05,375
- TAKE IT.

205
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,833
GOOD LUCK.
- YOU TOO.

206
00:14:16,875 --> 00:14:20,250
IT'S TIME TO GO BACK
TO ROMDEAU, RE-L.

207
00:14:28,083 --> 00:14:31,250
- HOP, HOP, HOP, HOP.

208
00:14:31,333 --> 00:14:33,666
HOP!
( laughing )

209
00:14:39,208 --> 00:14:40,708
AIRPLANE!

210
00:14:41,833 --> 00:14:43,708
- LET'S MOVE OUT!

211
00:14:56,541 --> 00:14:58,166
- BYE-BYE.

212
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:12,750
- RE-L MAYER'S BACK?

213
00:15:12,833 --> 00:15:15,875
- HER A.H.D. IS CURRENTLY DOCKED
OUTSIDE PLUG VENT NUMBER THREE.

214
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:17,541
THE HEALTH
AND WELFARE BUREAU

215
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:19,541
IS ASKING FOR PERMISSION
TO RECEIVE HER.

216
00:15:19,625 --> 00:15:21,750
- I'M TOO BUSY
FOR THIS.

217
00:15:21,833 --> 00:15:23,750
- CHIEF.

218
00:15:23,833 --> 00:15:25,791
- LET HER WAIT.

219
00:15:25,875 --> 00:15:28,333
I CAN'T APPROVE
THE RETURN OF SOMEONE

220
00:15:28,416 --> 00:15:30,333
WHO LEFT THE DOME
WITHOUT PERMISSION.

221
00:15:30,416 --> 00:15:32,333
FURTHERMORE, ANYONE
WHO ABANDONS THE DOME

222
00:15:32,416 --> 00:15:33,916
THE WAY
THAT YOUNG MAN HAS

223
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,333
DESERVES THE HARSHEST
PUNISHMENT ALLOWED,

224
00:15:36,416 --> 00:15:38,708
AND CERTAINLY
REASONABLE.

225
00:15:41,083 --> 00:15:44,333
YES, HE MUST HAVE
HIS CONSEQUENCES.

226
00:15:44,416 --> 00:15:46,958
WOULDN'T YOU AGREE,
KRISTEVA?

227
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:52,833
- THERE ARE NO WAVES.

228
00:15:52,916 --> 00:15:55,166
- ( coughing )

229
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:56,666
- HOW IS IT?

230
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:59,000
- YOU DO KNOW
I'M NOT ACTUALLY A MECHANIC?

231
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:00,833
- WE'RE NOT GONNA SINK,
ARE WE?

232
00:16:00,916 --> 00:16:03,583
- IF I WERE GONNA DIE, I'D BE
WITH A BETTER MAN THAN YOU.

233
00:16:03,666 --> 00:16:05,250
- NO KIDDING.
( laughs )

234
00:16:05,333 --> 00:16:07,500
- IDIOT, SHE WAS
TALKING ABOUT YOU.

235
00:16:07,583 --> 00:16:08,875
- WHAT?

236
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:11,958
- ANYWAY, REATTACH
THE BROKEN LINES.

237
00:16:12,041 --> 00:16:15,250
WE JUST NEED A QUICK FIX.
- BUT QUINN--

238
00:16:17,416 --> 00:16:20,166
- IT'S TOO QUIET.
THERE'S NO WIND BLOWING.

239
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:22,666
NO, IT'S MORE
THAN JUST THE WIND.

240
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:26,333
- QUINN, ARE THOSE
SCARY THINGS COMING?

241
00:16:26,416 --> 00:16:28,500
- DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

242
00:16:28,583 --> 00:16:30,500
- YOU'RE LIKE MY PAPA.

243
00:16:30,583 --> 00:16:33,666
- HEY, YOU'RE TRYING TO SAY
I'M LIKE YOUR MAMA, RIGHT?

244
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:37,041
- HMM?
OH, I DON'T KNOW.

245
00:16:50,208 --> 00:16:53,041
- ( men shouting ) GET 'EM!
- Rino: HELP!

246
00:16:53,125 --> 00:16:54,958
- HUH?

247
00:16:55,041 --> 00:16:57,916
- Men: GET 'EM!
AHA!

248
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,916
- DAMN IT.  TOO SOON FOR THIS.
- Man: COME ON, YOU.

249
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
HURRY, WE CAN'T TAKE
MUCH MORE OF THIS.

250
00:17:08,666 --> 00:17:10,083
- WHAT ABOUT CHIEF RAUL?

251
00:17:10,166 --> 00:17:12,333
- STILL NO ANSWER.
- USELESS.

252
00:17:12,416 --> 00:17:15,000
- I ASSUME IT'S TO DO WITH
CONTAINING RE-L'S INFECTION.

253
00:17:15,083 --> 00:17:17,333
- THAT WHOLE THING'S
MAKING MY HEAD HURT.

254
00:17:17,416 --> 00:17:20,750
- THE OTHER PASSENGER IDENTIFIED
HIMSELF AS VINCENT LAW--

255
00:17:20,833 --> 00:17:23,083
THE MAN THE SECURITY BUREAU
WAS PURSUING BEFORE.

256
00:17:23,166 --> 00:17:24,583
SHALL I REPORT IT?

257
00:17:24,666 --> 00:17:26,583
- SHE BROUGHT HIM BACK
WITH HER.

258
00:17:26,666 --> 00:17:28,583
HE'S WORTH OUR TIME.

259
00:17:28,666 --> 00:17:31,416
INFORM THEM THAT THERE IS
ANOTHER PASSENGER,

260
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,458
BUT KEEP NAMES OUT OF IT
FOR NOW.

261
00:17:33,541 --> 00:17:35,458
LET'S SEE HOW MUCH
WE CAN GET OUT OF HIM.

262
00:17:35,541 --> 00:17:37,458
- WHAT?
- IS THERE A PROBLEM?

263
00:17:37,541 --> 00:17:40,208
YOU DON'T SHOW YOUR HAND
UNTIL IT'S TIME

264
00:17:40,291 --> 00:17:42,875
FOR ALL CARDS ON THE TABLE.
- ( phone beeps )

265
00:17:48,041 --> 00:17:50,250
- GET THIS THING MOVING!

266
00:17:50,333 --> 00:17:51,375
- ( exclaims )

267
00:17:55,208 --> 00:17:57,625
- RINO, TAKE COVER.

268
00:18:24,416 --> 00:18:27,708
- CHIEF RAUL.
- YES, WHAT IS IT NOW?

269
00:18:27,791 --> 00:18:31,458
- YOU'RE AWARD OF OUR REQUEST
TO OPEN PLUG VENT NUMBER THREE?

270
00:18:31,541 --> 00:18:34,333
- THE OUTSIDE AIR
IS FILLED WITH GERMS.

271
00:18:34,416 --> 00:18:36,333
WHAT'S MORE, IT'S NOT
SUCH A SIMPLE MATTER

272
00:18:36,416 --> 00:18:38,583
OPENING A PLUG VENT
FOR SOMEONE WHO'S INFECTED.

273
00:18:38,666 --> 00:18:41,000
- YOU'VE HAD PLENTY OF TIME
TO DEAL WITH THOSE ISSUES,

274
00:18:41,083 --> 00:18:42,500
SECURITY CHIEF RAUL.

275
00:18:42,583 --> 00:18:44,708
WE ARE PREPARED
ON OUR END.

276
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:47,625
NOW AUTHORIZE THE OPENING
OF PLUG VENT THREE.

277
00:18:47,708 --> 00:18:50,666
- VERY WELL, DOCTOR.

278
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:53,000
- GOOD.  THEN WE'LL TAKE
RESPONSIBILITY

279
00:18:53,083 --> 00:18:54,500
FOR BOTH PASSENGERS.

280
00:18:54,583 --> 00:18:56,958
- BOTH PASSENGERS?

281
00:18:57,041 --> 00:19:00,416
SO SHE DIDN'T
COME BACK ALONE.

282
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:02,958
SHE FOUND VINCENT LAW.

283
00:19:04,208 --> 00:19:06,125
LEAVE THREE VEHICLES
IN PURSUIT

284
00:19:06,208 --> 00:19:09,583
AND HAVE THE REST HEAD FOR
PLUG VENT NUMBER THREE.

285
00:19:09,666 --> 00:19:12,583
I'LL JOIN THEM SHORTLY.
- YES, SIR.

286
00:19:13,708 --> 00:19:15,875
- I FOUND HIM.

287
00:19:15,958 --> 00:19:17,833
HE'S NOT
ON THE AIRSHIP.

288
00:19:24,166 --> 00:19:25,833
- WAIT, WHY ARE THEY
ALL LEAVING?

289
00:19:25,916 --> 00:19:27,583
- ALL RIGHT.

290
00:19:28,958 --> 00:19:30,625
HERE'S OUR CHANCE.
HURRY UP AND FIX IT.

291
00:19:30,708 --> 00:19:32,958
- THAT IS A LITTLE ODD,
ACTUALLY.

292
00:19:33,041 --> 00:19:36,291
I WAS NEVER INFORMED
OF THE OTHER PASSENGER'S NAME.

293
00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:38,416
WHAT MAKES YOU SO SURE
IT'S YOUR MAN?

294
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:40,083
OR IS THIS
JUST SPECULATION?

295
00:19:40,166 --> 00:19:42,791
- PERHAPS,
BUT I'VE GOT A FEELING.

296
00:19:42,875 --> 00:19:44,458
- VINCENT LAW,

297
00:19:44,541 --> 00:19:46,750
GUILTY OF TREASON
FOR DAMAGING AN ENTOURAGE.

298
00:19:46,833 --> 00:19:48,625
HE'S AN IMMIGRANT.

299
00:19:48,708 --> 00:19:51,291
HE MAY BE CONSIDERED A THREAT,
BUT I DON'T THINK HE WARRANTS

300
00:19:51,375 --> 00:19:53,958
HAVING THE SECURITY BUREAU USE
ITS FULL FORCE TO CAPTURE HIM.

301
00:19:54,041 --> 00:19:56,583
- YOU'RE CORRECT.
THE MAN IS INSIGNIFICANT.

302
00:19:56,666 --> 00:19:59,041
SO WHY DON'T YOU PLEASE
STOP PESTERING ME ABOUT IT?

303
00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:05,083
- MY APOLOGIES.
YOU HAVE YOUR REASONS.

304
00:20:05,166 --> 00:20:08,083
- RE-L MAYER IS ON THE OTHER
SIDE OF THAT PLUG VENT.

305
00:20:08,166 --> 00:20:11,041
I WOULD HATE TO THINK YOU'VE
FORGOTTEN THAT, DR. DAEDALUS.

306
00:20:15,208 --> 00:20:18,625
- ( clock chiming )

307
00:20:18,708 --> 00:20:20,833
- ( mechanical waltz playing )

308
00:20:37,375 --> 00:20:38,875
- YES, OF COURSE.

309
00:20:38,958 --> 00:20:40,666
- THE OTHER PASSENGER,
VINCENT LAW,

310
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:43,250
IS TO BE EXECUTED IMMEDIATELY
UPON IDENTIFICATION.

311
00:20:43,333 --> 00:20:44,833
- IT CAN'T BE HELPED.

312
00:20:44,916 --> 00:20:47,208
RE-L IS OUR
TOP PRIORITY FOR NOW.

313
00:20:47,291 --> 00:20:49,666
TELL HIM
THERE WILL BE HELL TO PAY

314
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:52,458
IF I FIND SHE HAS
SO MUCH AS A SCRATCH.

315
00:20:52,541 --> 00:20:56,250
- EXCUSE ME, CHIEF.
MAY I OPEN THE PLUG VENT?

316
00:20:56,333 --> 00:20:59,750
- YES, GO AHEAD.

317
00:20:59,833 --> 00:21:01,750
- OPENING THE HATCH.

318
00:21:18,583 --> 00:21:21,208
- SHOW ME YOUR FACE,
VINCENT LAW.

319
00:21:41,875 --> 00:21:45,000
- ALL RIGHT!
WE'RE MOVING!  WE'RE MOVING!

320
00:21:45,083 --> 00:21:47,541
- YEAH, THAT WAS
SOME GOOD WORK, KID.

321
00:21:53,791 --> 00:21:56,083
- ( mechanical waltz
continues )

322
00:22:22,791 --> 00:22:24,750
- ALL RIGHT THEN.

323
00:22:31,416 --> 00:22:33,291
- ( two gunshots )

324
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:44,375
- QUINN!

325
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:51,916
- ( waltz stops playing )

326
00:23:04,375 --> 00:23:06,791
- Kristeva: THE SHIP HAS MADE IT
ACROSS THE BAY.

327
00:23:06,875 --> 00:23:10,458
THE PATROL CRAFT
CAN'T PURSUE IT ANY FURTHER.

328
00:23:10,541 --> 00:23:13,208
- BURN THE COMMUNE
TO THE GROUND.

329
00:23:15,125 --> 00:23:16,916
- Vincent: QUINN.

330
00:23:18,291 --> 00:23:20,458
WHAT'S THIS?
- WHISKEY.

331
00:23:20,541 --> 00:23:22,458
MY LAST SHOT.

332
00:23:22,541 --> 00:23:25,000
IT'S FOR YOU.
DRINK UP.

333
00:23:25,083 --> 00:23:27,000
- WE CAN STILL GO BACK
TO THE COMMUNE.

334
00:23:27,083 --> 00:23:29,500
WE'LL GET YOU SOME FIRST AID.
- Older man: QUINN.

335
00:23:29,583 --> 00:23:33,791
- PLEASE DON'T EVEN THINK
ABOUT BEING THAT STUPID.

336
00:23:37,458 --> 00:23:40,625
LOOK, THEY CAN'T FOLLOW.

337
00:23:40,708 --> 00:23:43,375
THEY'RE JUST FLYING
IN CIRCLES.

338
00:23:43,458 --> 00:23:46,125
I CAN'T BELIEVE
WE WERE AFRAID OF THOSE.

339
00:23:46,208 --> 00:23:49,833
I MEAN,
IT'S FUNNY, RIGHT?

340
00:23:49,916 --> 00:23:53,708
IT'S LESS
THAN YOU DESERVE,

341
00:23:53,791 --> 00:23:56,833
YOU BASTARDS.

342
00:23:56,916 --> 00:23:58,833
- Older man: QUINN.
- HEY, QUINN.

343
00:24:06,875 --> 00:24:10,458
I FEEL VERY SAD,

344
00:24:10,541 --> 00:24:12,416
QUINN.
