1
00:00:53,291 --> 00:00:55,833
- Vincent: RE-L.
BUT WHY?

2
00:00:59,541 --> 00:01:01,791
- I DIDN'T
TRAVEL ALL THE WAY HERE

3
00:01:01,875 --> 00:01:04,125
JUST TO GIVE THAT
BACK TO YOU.

4
00:01:04,208 --> 00:01:05,791
NO MORE GAMES.

5
00:01:05,875 --> 00:01:09,666
TELL ME EVERYTHING YOU KNOW,
VINCENT LAW.

6
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:11,250
- RE-L...

7
00:01:11,333 --> 00:01:14,250
I AM...

8
00:01:14,333 --> 00:01:16,125
- IMPOSSIBLE.

9
00:01:18,958 --> 00:01:22,083
DO YOU REALLY EXPECT ME
TO BELIEVE THAT?

10
00:01:23,458 --> 00:01:25,125
THAT YOU'RE A--

11
00:01:27,333 --> 00:01:30,041

Pino:
VINCE?

24
00:03:16,833 --> 00:03:20,666
THE SCARY LADY,
IS SHE COMING WITH US?

25
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:22,291
- MAYBE.

26
00:03:22,375 --> 00:03:24,375
DO YOU WANT HER
TO COME WITH US?

27
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:29,041
YOUR FACE LOOKS FUNNY.

28
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:31,500
- HEY.

29
00:03:31,583 --> 00:03:33,791
IT'S JUST I--

30
00:03:33,875 --> 00:03:36,666
- I CAN TELL
YOU KNOW SOMETHING.

31
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:40,125
YOU KNOW SOMETHING
ABOUT THE PROXY.

32
00:03:40,208 --> 00:03:42,791
WHY DOES IT ONLY APPEAR
WHEN YOU'RE AROUND?

33
00:03:42,875 --> 00:03:45,333
DO YOU CALL FOR IT TO COME?

34
00:03:45,416 --> 00:03:47,666
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU?

35
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:51,833
( grunts )
- I SWEAR I DIDN'T KNOW BEFORE.

36
00:03:53,416 --> 00:03:55,916
I ONLY JUST REALIZED
I'M A PROXY.

37
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,666
- WHAT DO YOU--

38
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:01,208
- I'M NOT SUMMONING
THE PROXY.

39
00:04:03,625 --> 00:04:06,958
I AM THE PROXY.

40
00:04:12,541 --> 00:04:15,375
MAYBE SHE SHOULD GO BACK
TO ROMDEAU.

41
00:04:34,583 --> 00:04:36,208
- I'M GLAD
WE CAUGHT UP WITH HIM

42
00:04:36,291 --> 00:04:39,375
WHILE WE STILL
HAD SOME FUEL LEFT.

43
00:05:13,083 --> 00:05:15,000
- HEY!
SCARY LADY!

44
00:05:15,083 --> 00:05:17,750
OVER HERE!
- HEY!

45
00:05:17,833 --> 00:05:19,916
- ( laughs )

46
00:05:23,791 --> 00:05:26,083
WHOA, COOL!

47
00:05:26,166 --> 00:05:29,458
- THAT AUTOREIV'S INFECTED
WITH THE COGITO VIRUS.

48
00:05:29,541 --> 00:05:31,208
YOU STAY HERE.

49
00:05:31,291 --> 00:05:33,708
- UH?  BUT RE-L!

50
00:05:42,333 --> 00:05:44,416
- OH, IT'S HOT.

51
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,750
( sighs )

52
00:05:52,333 --> 00:05:54,041
WHAT?

53
00:05:54,125 --> 00:05:57,458
- IT'S JUST I REALLY WISH
I COULD EAT FOOD.

54
00:05:57,541 --> 00:06:00,500
BUT I LIKE WATCHING.
IT'S SO COOL.

55
00:06:00,583 --> 00:06:03,375
- JUST GO AWAY.
I DON'T LIKE YOU STARING.

56
00:06:03,458 --> 00:06:05,166
- NYAH!

57
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,416
- SORRY ABOUT HER.

58
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:11,375
- I STILL THINK YOU'RE LYING.
- HUH?

59
00:06:11,458 --> 00:06:14,916
- ABOUT YOU BEING THE PROXY.

60
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,416
- IT'S UNDERSTANDABLE.

61
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:21,625
I FIND THE SITUATION
PRETTY HARD TO BELIEVE MYSELF.

62
00:06:21,708 --> 00:06:25,666
THAT'S WHY I NEED ANSWERS.

63
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:28,583
THE ONLY THING I DO KNOW

64
00:06:28,666 --> 00:06:31,416
IS THERE ARE STILL
OTHER PROXIES OUT THERE.

65
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:32,916
- OTHER PROXIES?

66
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,208
YOU'RE SURE?

67
00:06:39,291 --> 00:06:42,250
- I FEEL IT.
THERE ARE OTHERS.

68
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:47,958
I BELIEVE I'VE COME IN CONTACT
WITH AT LEAST TWO OTHER PROXIES.

69
00:06:48,041 --> 00:06:50,125
BOTH TIMES I KILLED THEM.

70
00:06:50,208 --> 00:06:51,708
- KILLED THEM?

71
00:06:51,791 --> 00:06:55,291
- THE FIRST ONE WAS IN CHAROS,
THE SECOND IN ASURA.

72
00:06:55,375 --> 00:06:58,458
AND THE SECOND TIME,
THE PROXY AND I TALKED.

73
00:06:58,541 --> 00:07:01,625
IT TOLD ME
THAT I HAD LOST MY MEMORY.

74
00:07:01,708 --> 00:07:05,291
WHATEVER I'M MISSING,
IT HAPPENED IN MOSK.

75
00:07:05,375 --> 00:07:08,166
I KNOW I'VE
FIGURED THAT MUCH OUT AT LEAST.

76
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:12,666
IF I GO TO MOSK,
I MIGHT FIND ANSWERS.

77
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:16,000
FOR NOW, ALL I KNOW FOR CERTAIN
IS THAT I'M A PROXY

78
00:07:16,083 --> 00:07:18,583
AND THERE'S NO TURNING BACK.

79
00:07:18,666 --> 00:07:20,583
- OKAY.

80
00:07:20,666 --> 00:07:24,041
- SO YOU STILL
THINK I'M CRAZY, RIGHT?

81
00:07:25,875 --> 00:07:27,666
- YEAH.

82
00:07:35,791 --> 00:07:37,333
- HMM?

83
00:07:57,541 --> 00:08:00,375
- IT'LL KILL THE PROXY?

84
00:08:00,458 --> 00:08:03,208
- WELL, IT'S THE BEST DEFENSE
I CAN GIVE YOU,

85
00:08:03,291 --> 00:08:05,083
AT LEAST FOR THE TIME-BEING.

86
00:08:05,166 --> 00:08:08,041
I THINK I'VE COME UP
WITH SOMETHING

87
00:08:08,125 --> 00:08:10,291
TO DESTROY THE PROXY.

88
00:08:10,375 --> 00:08:13,458
THIS BULLET
HAS AN F.P. PAYLOAD.

89
00:08:13,541 --> 00:08:15,625
HARMLESS TO HUMANS,
THE F.P. RAYS

90
00:08:15,708 --> 00:08:17,083
SHOULD AFFECT THE AMRITA CELLS

91
00:08:17,166 --> 00:08:19,166
WHICH ARE UNIQUE
TO THE PROXY.

92
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:21,208
AS LONG AS THE BULLET
MAKES CONTACT,

93
00:08:21,291 --> 00:08:23,583
THE F.P. RAYS
WILL BLANKET THE TARGET,

94
00:08:23,666 --> 00:08:25,708
MAKING ANY HIT
A CONFIRMED KILL.

95
00:08:25,791 --> 00:08:27,500
AT LEAST IN THEORY, ANYWAY.

96
00:08:27,583 --> 00:08:28,916
- HARD TO BELIEVE--

97
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
THIS IS ALL IT TAKES.

98
00:08:31,083 --> 00:08:33,333
- ALL IT TAKES THEORETICALLY.

99
00:08:33,416 --> 00:08:36,000
THAT'S WHY THEY'RE YOURS NOW.

100
00:08:36,083 --> 00:08:40,500
SO IF IN YOUR TRAVELS,
YOU COME ACROSS THE PROXY--

101
00:08:40,583 --> 00:08:42,875
- YOU WANT ME
TO TEST THIS OUT.

102
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:45,208
TRY TO KEEP IN MIND,

103
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:49,250
MY FIRST PRIORITY IS TO ATTEMPT
TO CAPTURE THE PROXY.

104
00:08:49,333 --> 00:08:52,333
- OF COURSE.
IT'S MINE TOO.

105
00:08:52,416 --> 00:08:55,666
WELL, I'LL BE WAITING FOR YOU.

106
00:08:57,875 --> 00:08:59,583
- Re-l: DAEDALUS AND I
BOTH THOUGHT

107
00:08:59,666 --> 00:09:01,750
THAT IF WE COULD
CAPTURE THE PROXY,

108
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:04,125
THEN THE MYSTERY
WOULD BE SOLVED.

109
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:09,541
NOW I WONDER.

110
00:09:09,625 --> 00:09:13,291
I'VE FINALLY SEEN
THE OUTSIDE WORLD.

111
00:09:13,375 --> 00:09:15,125
AND IT'S BEDLAM.

112
00:09:15,208 --> 00:09:17,791
ROMDEAU IS THE LAST REFUGE
OF ORDER

113
00:09:17,875 --> 00:09:20,708
AGAINST THE CHAOS
OF THE GATE.

114
00:09:20,791 --> 00:09:24,333
NO.
ROMDEAU'S FALLING AS WELL.

115
00:09:24,416 --> 00:09:27,791
THE RAMPAGING PROXY,

116
00:09:27,875 --> 00:09:31,125
THE RISING NUMBER
OF COGITO INFECTIONS.

117
00:09:31,208 --> 00:09:34,125
AND EVEN THOUGH
I'M THE REGENT'S GRANDDAUGHTER,

118
00:09:34,208 --> 00:09:37,125
I NARROWLY ESCAPED
AN ASSASSINATION.

119
00:09:37,208 --> 00:09:39,666
EVEN IF HE IS A PROXY,

120
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:42,000
WHAT PROFIT IS THERE

121
00:09:42,083 --> 00:09:45,500
IN TAKING HIM BACK
TO ROMDEAU NOW?

122
00:09:45,583 --> 00:09:48,333
BUT I CAN'T LET HIM CONTINUE.

123
00:09:49,416 --> 00:09:52,333
WHAT DO I DO?

124
00:09:52,416 --> 00:09:56,833
- RE-L, ARE WE TAKING
VINCENT LAW INTO CUSTODY?

125
00:09:56,916 --> 00:09:59,000
EITHER WAY,
IF WE'RE GOING BACK TO ROMDEAU,

126
00:09:59,083 --> 00:10:00,541
IT'S NOW OR NEVER.

127
00:10:00,625 --> 00:10:03,833
RE-L, DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME?

128
00:10:03,916 --> 00:10:07,041
- I STILL DON'T BELIEVE HIM.
- HUH?

129
00:10:07,125 --> 00:10:09,375
- BUT I NEED TO BE SURE.

130
00:10:09,458 --> 00:10:10,541
- RE-L?

131
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:19,375
- Re-l:
HE SAYS HE'S A PROXY?

132
00:10:19,458 --> 00:10:21,916
FINE.
I CAN FIND OUT WITH ONE SHOT.

133
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,250
IF HE LIVES,
HE'S A LIAR.

134
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:27,083
AND IF IT'S TRUE--

135
00:10:27,166 --> 00:10:29,666
NO, HE'S LYING!

136
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:33,166
F.P. SHELLS
ARE HARMLESS TO HUMANS.

137
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:35,666
I'LL JUST SHOOT HIM
IN THE LEG.

138
00:10:38,166 --> 00:10:40,083
( sighs )

139
00:10:44,125 --> 00:10:45,916
VINCENT?

140
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,083
I BELIEVE THAT YOU
AND THE PROXY ARE CONNECTED.

141
00:10:49,166 --> 00:10:52,708
THAT'S WHY I FOLLOWED YOU
ALL THIS WAY.

142
00:10:56,791 --> 00:11:01,541
I-- I GUESS I FELT MYSELF
BEING STRANGELY DRAWN TO YOU.

143
00:11:01,625 --> 00:11:04,000
I THOUGHT ABOUT YOU

144
00:11:04,083 --> 00:11:06,833
MORE THAN A LITTLE
DURING THIS JOURNEY.

145
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:10,625
TELL ME, ARE YOU A PROXY?

146
00:11:10,708 --> 00:11:14,125
EVEN IF YOU ARE,
IT'S STILL GOING TO--

147
00:11:14,208 --> 00:11:17,291
- ( both gasp )

148
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:25,166
- Vincent: I LOVE YOU.

149
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:26,750
- HUH?

150
00:11:26,833 --> 00:11:29,500
- I SAID I LOVE YOU, RE-L.

151
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:45,625
BUT HOW COULD AN IMMIGRANT--

152
00:11:45,708 --> 00:11:50,208
I MEAN, A MONSTER LIKE ME
FEEL THIS WAY?

153
00:11:50,291 --> 00:11:53,083
I TRIED TO STOP
FEELING THESE THINGS.

154
00:11:53,166 --> 00:11:55,583
I TRIED TELLING MYSELF
IT DIDN'T MATTER

155
00:11:55,666 --> 00:11:58,333
BECAUSE I'D
NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN.

156
00:11:58,416 --> 00:12:01,708
BUT NOW YOU'RE HERE
AND I'M IN LOVE WITH YOU.

157
00:12:01,791 --> 00:12:04,708
- ( gasps )

158
00:12:04,791 --> 00:12:05,666
- WHAT?

159
00:12:28,875 --> 00:12:31,666
- ( rustling )
- ( sighs )

160
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:34,666
- Vincent: WHO ARE YOU?!

161
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:40,791
WAIT!

162
00:12:53,916 --> 00:12:56,666
THERE ARE PEOPLE
EVEN OUT HERE.

163
00:13:20,333 --> 00:13:21,833
- ( computer beeping ) 
- TELL ME.

164
00:13:21,916 --> 00:13:23,291
- IT'S NO GOOD.

165
00:13:23,375 --> 00:13:26,208
EVEN TAKING INTO ACCOUNT
THE POSSIBILITY OF REFUELING

166
00:13:26,291 --> 00:13:27,875
ALONG THE WAY,

167
00:13:27,958 --> 00:13:30,208
IT'S TOO DANGEROUS
TO GO ANY FURTHER.

168
00:13:30,291 --> 00:13:33,833
YOUR PRINCE SAID SO HIMSELF,
DIDN'T HE?

169
00:13:33,916 --> 00:13:36,375
HE TOLD US TO MAKE SURE
WE HAVE ENOUGH FUEL

170
00:13:36,458 --> 00:13:39,291
TO MAKE THE RETURN TRIP
TO ROMDEAU.

171
00:13:39,375 --> 00:13:42,791
YOU CAN'T FORGET THE WISHES
OF THOSE WHO CARE ABOUT YOU.

172
00:13:42,875 --> 00:13:45,458
AND DON'T IGNORE THAT
HANDSOME BOYFRIEND OF YOURS.

173
00:13:45,541 --> 00:13:47,791
- DAEDALUS IS MY DOCTOR.

174
00:13:47,875 --> 00:13:51,458
- WHATEVER.
LET'S JUST GO BACK HOME NOW.

175
00:13:51,541 --> 00:13:53,375
RE-L?
- IGGY,

176
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:56,041
YOU ALREADY KNOW
THE WHOLE SITUATION, RIGHT?

177
00:13:56,125 --> 00:13:57,958
BACK IN ROMDEAU,

178
00:13:58,041 --> 00:14:00,041
RE-L MAYER IS ALREADY DEAD.

179
00:14:00,125 --> 00:14:02,166
- I'M SURE YOUR PRINCE
WILL MANAGE

180
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:04,083
TO TAKE CARE OF IT SOMEHOW.

181
00:14:04,166 --> 00:14:06,083
- Re-l:
MY PRIDE WOULDN'T ALLOW IT.

182
00:14:06,166 --> 00:14:08,583
IF WE TURN BACK NOW, THIS ALL
WILL HAVE BEEN FOR NOTHING.

183
00:14:08,666 --> 00:14:10,583
- I GUESS, BUT--

184
00:14:10,666 --> 00:14:13,583
- I KNOW.  IF WE CAN'T
KEEP USING THE U4,

185
00:14:13,666 --> 00:14:15,333
THEN WE CAN USE HIS SHIP.

186
00:14:15,416 --> 00:14:17,583
IT'S WIND-POWERED.

187
00:14:17,666 --> 00:14:19,083
I KNOW IT LOOKS PRIMITIVE,

188
00:14:19,166 --> 00:14:21,458
BUT WE WON'T HAVE TO
WORRY ABOUT FUEL.

189
00:14:21,541 --> 00:14:23,625
- YOU'RE GOING
TO STEAL HIS SHIP?

190
00:14:23,708 --> 00:14:25,125
- NOT EXACTLY.

191
00:14:25,208 --> 00:14:27,541
- YOU WANT TO BE WITH HIM
THAT BADLY?

192
00:14:27,625 --> 00:14:29,250
- I DON'T KNOW.

193
00:14:29,333 --> 00:14:32,125
BUT HE SEEMS
TO FEEL THAT WAY ABOUT ME.

194
00:14:32,208 --> 00:14:33,250
- HUH?

195
00:14:33,333 --> 00:14:35,666
- HE THINKS
HE'S IN LOVE WITH ME.

196
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:39,375
AND I'M NOT READY
TO RETURN TO ROMDEAU.

197
00:14:39,458 --> 00:14:41,541
- RE-L?
- ARE YOU DONE?

198
00:14:41,625 --> 00:14:44,375
- HUH?
OH, YEAH, YOU'RE ALL SET.

199
00:14:44,458 --> 00:14:46,125
- I'M GONNA WORK THIS OUT,

200
00:14:46,208 --> 00:14:48,125
NO MATTER WHAT.

201
00:14:52,041 --> 00:14:54,000
- HEY, PINO!

202
00:14:56,208 --> 00:14:58,333
HELLO?

203
00:14:58,416 --> 00:14:59,916
DAMN.

204
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,291
I WAS REALLY HOPING
SHE MIGHT PICK UP A FEW THINGS

205
00:15:02,375 --> 00:15:03,916
FROM RE-L'S ENTOURAGE.

206
00:15:06,166 --> 00:15:09,916
( grunts ) OW!

207
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,875
- ( flute playing )

208
00:15:16,375 --> 00:15:20,791
- AHHH!

209
00:15:29,291 --> 00:15:31,500
HUH?

210
00:16:01,666 --> 00:16:03,166
HMM?

211
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:05,958
HEY, YOU WERE
AT THE RABBIT YESTERDAY!

212
00:16:06,041 --> 00:16:07,291
THE RABBIT BROKE,

213
00:16:07,375 --> 00:16:09,500
SO VINCE
IS GOING BANG BANG ON IT.

214
00:16:09,583 --> 00:16:11,458
IT GOT NOISY,
SO I WENT AWAY.

215
00:16:13,375 --> 00:16:16,500
HEY, WHY WON'T YOU
SAY ANYTHING?

216
00:16:16,583 --> 00:16:19,541
COME ON, DON'T YOU WANT
TO TALK TO ME?

217
00:16:19,625 --> 00:16:22,416
MAYBE YOU DON'T KNOW
HOW TO TALK.

218
00:16:24,166 --> 00:16:28,416
- ( growling )

219
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:29,916
- VINCE?

220
00:16:33,291 --> 00:16:36,916
- ( gasps )

221
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:41,291
- ( shouting )

222
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:43,916
- AHHH!

223
00:16:48,708 --> 00:16:52,000
- ( gasps )
WHAT'S HAPPENED?

224
00:16:52,083 --> 00:16:53,500
STOP.

225
00:16:53,583 --> 00:16:55,166
THAT AUTOREIV'S INFECTED.

226
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:57,000
YOU STAY HERE.

227
00:16:57,083 --> 00:16:58,750
- BUT...

228
00:16:58,833 --> 00:17:01,333
IT'S ALREADY TOO LATE.

229
00:17:02,833 --> 00:17:03,708
HUH?

230
00:17:06,291 --> 00:17:08,666
- ( groaning )

231
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:22,291
AHHHH!

232
00:17:23,916 --> 00:17:25,791
- VINCENT LAW.

233
00:17:28,958 --> 00:17:31,708
- SCARY LADY!

234
00:17:47,958 --> 00:17:52,250
- ( growling )

235
00:17:52,333 --> 00:17:55,791
- OH, VINCENT.
NO.

236
00:17:55,875 --> 00:17:58,750
- AHHHH!

237
00:18:05,708 --> 00:18:06,958
- VINCE!

238
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:30,708
- VINCENT.
- HEY, DON'T WORRY.

239
00:18:30,791 --> 00:18:32,708
VINCE IS REAL STRONG.

240
00:18:32,791 --> 00:18:34,458
HUH?

241
00:18:34,541 --> 00:18:37,166
- Iggy: RE-L!

242
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:38,833
- IGGY.

243
00:18:38,916 --> 00:18:41,583
- WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
IT'S DANGEROUS.

244
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:44,375
LADY!

245
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:48,416
- RE-L.
- IT'S VINCENT, HE--

246
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:50,291
- I KNOW.
I SAW IT TOO.

247
00:18:50,375 --> 00:18:53,708
- IT'S THE SAME EXACT PROXY
I SAW IN ROMDEAU.

248
00:18:53,791 --> 00:18:56,583
IT'S THE ONLY THING
I'VE EVER SEEN

249
00:18:56,666 --> 00:18:58,291
THAT TERRIFIED ME.

250
00:18:58,375 --> 00:19:00,916
STILL,

251
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,708
I HAVE TO SEE
IF THE F.P. SHELLS WORK.

252
00:19:04,791 --> 00:19:08,083
I HAVE TO KNOW IF THIS
WILL REALLY KILL A PROXY.

253
00:19:10,166 --> 00:19:12,250
- Iggy:
YOU'RE GOING TO SHOOT HIM?

254
00:19:14,125 --> 00:19:16,375
- ( grunting )

255
00:19:41,375 --> 00:19:44,625
- ( gun cocks )
- CAREFUL.

256
00:19:44,708 --> 00:19:47,583
YOU'VE ONLY GOT
TWO F.P. ROUNDS.

257
00:19:47,666 --> 00:19:49,541
- YEAH.

258
00:19:49,625 --> 00:19:51,208
- YOU WERE RIGHT.

259
00:19:51,291 --> 00:19:55,791
THE MAN WE'VE BEEN CHASING
THIS WHOLE TIME WAS A PROXY.

260
00:19:55,875 --> 00:19:58,833
WE CAN FINALLY GO BACK
TO ROMDEAU.

261
00:19:58,916 --> 00:20:01,958
- AHHH!

262
00:20:55,708 --> 00:20:57,750
- WHY DIDN'T YOU SHOOT HIM?

263
00:21:03,875 --> 00:21:05,666
- IGGY!

264
00:21:08,833 --> 00:21:11,041
- Iggy: VITAL SIGNS-- NEGATIVE.

265
00:21:11,125 --> 00:21:14,208
- HE'S DEAD?  YOU SURE?

266
00:21:14,291 --> 00:21:16,250
- RE-L.

267
00:21:18,458 --> 00:21:20,208
- ( clicking ) 
- ( gasps )

268
00:21:22,083 --> 00:21:25,000
- ( whirring )

269
00:21:37,625 --> 00:21:40,583
- I'VE SEEN IT
WITH MY OWN EYES.

270
00:21:40,666 --> 00:21:43,125
NOW I BELIEVE
YOU'RE A PROXY.

271
00:21:43,208 --> 00:21:45,250
IN THIS GUN

272
00:21:45,333 --> 00:21:47,750
IS THE ONLY WEAPON
THAT CAN KILL A PROXY.

273
00:21:47,833 --> 00:21:51,375
VINCENT,
IF I PULL THIS TRIGGER,

274
00:21:51,458 --> 00:21:54,291
I CAN KILL YOU TOO.

275
00:21:54,375 --> 00:21:57,083
Vincent ( low voice ):
KILL ME?

276
00:21:57,166 --> 00:22:00,958
DID YOU SAY
YOU'RE GOING TO KILL ME?

277
00:22:01,041 --> 00:22:03,500
ME?! 
- Vincent: STOP IT!

278
00:22:03,583 --> 00:22:07,833
( Vincent grunting )

279
00:22:10,125 --> 00:22:12,583
RE-L, PLEASE.

280
00:22:12,666 --> 00:22:15,833
- FINE.
I WON'T KILL YOU.

281
00:22:15,916 --> 00:22:18,416
BUT I'M COMING WITH YOU.
- RE-L!

282
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:21,041
- WHAT I CAME HERE TO FIND
WAS THE TRUTH,

283
00:22:21,125 --> 00:22:22,833
NOT A DEAD PROXY.

284
00:22:25,458 --> 00:22:27,791
JUST REMEMBER THIS--

285
00:22:27,875 --> 00:22:30,333
SOMEDAY I'M GOING
TO PULL THAT TRIGGER.

286
00:22:30,416 --> 00:22:34,041
SO CAN YOU STILL LOVE ME
KNOWING THAT?

287
00:22:46,916 --> 00:22:48,500
THAT'S AMAZING.

288
00:22:48,583 --> 00:22:51,166
DAEDALUS IS SURE
GOING TO BE HAPPY.

289
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:54,458
- I CAN'T
GO BACK TO ROMDEAU ALONE.

290
00:22:54,541 --> 00:22:56,000
- I WANT YOU TO TELL DAEDALUS

291
00:22:56,083 --> 00:22:57,875
ABOUT EVERYTHING
THAT YOU SAW HERE.

292
00:22:57,958 --> 00:23:00,666
- NO!
I WON'T HEAR ANY MORE OF THIS.

293
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:03,583
YOU NEED TO COME BACK
WITH ME TO ROMDEAU.

294
00:23:03,666 --> 00:23:06,500
HE'S A PROXY.
WHY WON'T YOU SEE REASON?

295
00:23:06,583 --> 00:23:09,125
RE-L, I WANT AN EXPLANATION.

296
00:23:09,208 --> 00:23:11,291
- IS THAT ALL YOU WANT?

297
00:23:11,375 --> 00:23:13,583
EXPLAIN WHAT?

298
00:23:13,666 --> 00:23:15,875
HOW COULD I EXPLAIN
TO AN AUTOREIV?

299
00:23:15,958 --> 00:23:19,250
HOW DO I CONVINCE YOU
WHEN I DON'T EVEN UNDERSTAND?

300
00:23:19,333 --> 00:23:21,208
- RE-L, I DON'T THINK--

301
00:23:21,291 --> 00:23:23,375
- APPLICATION OFF.

302
00:23:23,458 --> 00:23:26,166
FOLLOW YOUR ORDERS, IGGY.

303
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:28,166
RETURN TO ROMDEAU.

304
00:23:36,125 --> 00:23:37,208
- ROGER.

305
00:23:37,291 --> 00:23:39,041
RETURNING TO ROMDEAU.

306
00:23:39,125 --> 00:23:42,166
PLEASE CONFIRM.
- CONFIRMED.

307
00:24:03,125 --> 00:24:05,791
- Vincent: WHAT NOW?

308
00:24:05,875 --> 00:24:07,166
- HUH?

309
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:10,000
- WHAT THE HELL
DO WE DO NOW?
