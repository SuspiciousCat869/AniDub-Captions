00:03:43,708 --> 00:03:46,833
HELLO, GOOD EVENING, EVERYONE.
THANKS FOR JOINING US TONIGHT.

47
00:03:46,916 --> 00:03:51,375
I HOPE YOU'RE READY TO...

00:03:51,458 --> 00:03:53,166

49
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:55,791
AS ALWAYS,
I'M YOUR HUMBLE HOST MCQ.

50
00:03:55,875 --> 00:03:58,375
THANK YOU, EVERYONE.
REALLY, YOU'RE TOO KIND.

51
00:03:58,458 --> 00:04:00,791
YOU'RE NOT TIRED
OF SEEING MY HANDSOME FACE?

52
00:04:00,875 --> 00:04:04,791
NO, DON'T SAY THAT.
SO LET'S BEGIN.

53
00:04:04,875 --> 00:04:07,708
AS ALWAYS, WE START BY LAYING
DOWN THE RULES OF THE GAME.

54
00:04:07,791 --> 00:04:09,541
SO LET'S Q-Q-Q-Q!

55
00:04:09,625 --> 00:04:11,500
- Woman: THE RULES
FOR THE QUIZ ARE SIMPLE.

56
00:04:11,583 --> 00:04:14,250
THE CONTESTANT MUST SCORE ONE
MILLION POINTS IN 30 MINUTES.

57
00:04:14,333 --> 00:04:16,333
IF HE ANSWERS
OUR QUESTIONS CORRECTLY

58
00:04:16,416 --> 00:04:18,416
AND SAFELY REACHES
THE ONE MILLION POINT GOAL,

59
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:21,458
THEN HE WALKS AWAY
WITH THESE FABULOUS PRIZES.

60
00:04:21,541 --> 00:04:24,208
AS A BONUS, WHEN THE CONTESTANT
REACHES ONE MILLION POINTS,

61
00:04:24,291 --> 00:04:28,250
OUR HOST MCQ WILL DIE!
- YOU WIN AND I'M...

62
00:04:28,333 --> 00:04:29,750
THAT'S RIGHT, FOLKS.

63
00:04:29,833 --> 00:04:32,791
THE MOMENT A CHALLENGER WINS,
OUR SHOW IS OVER FOR GOOD.

64
00:04:32,875 --> 00:04:36,250
SO FAR I'VE MANAGED TO GET THE
BEST OF 25 CONTESTANTS IN A ROW.

65
00:04:36,333 --> 00:04:39,458
A VICTORY TODAY WILL GIVE US
A FULL TWO SEASONS ON THE AIR.

66
00:04:39,541 --> 00:04:41,291
DO YOU FOLKS THINK WE CAN
MAKE IT?

67
00:04:41,375 --> 00:04:44,666
WHAT HAPPENS IF OUR CONTESTANT
DOESN'T MAKE A MILLION POINTS?

68
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:47,833
LET'S HAVE OUR LOVELY ANNOUNCER
MELODY EXPLAIN IT TO US.

69
00:04:47,916 --> 00:04:50,416
- IF HE DOESN'T REACH
ONE MILLION POINTS,

70
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:53,250
THEN I'M AFRAID
THE CHALLENGER DIES.

71
00:04:53,333 --> 00:04:56,833
SO DO YOUR BEST
AND HOPEFULLY YOU'LL SURVIVE.

72
00:04:56,916 --> 00:05:00,375
- I JUST LOVE THE WAY YOU LAY
OUT THE RULES EACH WEEK, MELODY.

75
00:05:22,666 --> 00:05:25,166
LET'S GET TO KNOW

76
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:26,750
WHO IS TODAY'S CHALLENGER?

77
00:05:26,833 --> 00:05:29,541

00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,375

80
00:05:36,458 --> 00:05:39,041
YOU'VE COME QUITE A LONG WAY
TO BE HERE TONIGHT, RIGHT?

81
00:05:39,125 --> 00:05:42,541
- WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?
- OKAY, GOT A GENIUS HERE.

82
00:05:42,625 --> 00:05:44,500
LET'S SEE WHAT WE GOT HERE.

83
00:05:44,583 --> 00:05:47,375
SAYS YOU'RE UNEMPLOYED
WITH NO FIXED ADDRESS.

84
00:05:47,458 --> 00:05:49,833
- ( audience booing )
- HAD A BIT OF BAD LUCK LATELY.

85
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:52,000
AND YOU'RE LOOKING
A LITTLE THIN, TOO.

86
00:05:52,083 --> 00:05:55,833
NO ONE EVER SAID LIFE WAS EASY.
HARD TO EVEN EAT WHEN 

87
00:05:55,916 --> 00:05:57,416
YOU'RE DOWN ON YOUR LUCK.
CHEER UP.

88
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:00,583
ON OUR SHOW YOU HAVE THE CHANCE
TO TURN THAT BAD LUCK AROUND.

89
00:06:00,666 --> 00:06:02,458
SO DO YOUR BEST
AND TRY TO WALK AWAY

90
00:06:02,541 --> 00:06:05,375
WITH THOSE FABULOUS PRIZES.
- YEAH, SURE.

91
00:06:05,458 --> 00:06:07,875

POINTS HE HAS.

92
00:06:07,958 --> 00:06:10,083
- Melody:
A TOTAL OF 90,000 POINTS.

93
00:06:10,166 --> 00:06:11,791
- JUST 90,000 POINTS?

94
00:06:11,875 --> 00:06:15,333
NOT OFF TO A VERY GOOD START,
ARE WE?  ARE YOU GONNA BE OK?

95
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:17,583
- UH, YEAH.
- RIGHT.

96
00:06:17,666 --> 00:06:20,083
NOT A TALKER, IS HE?
ARE YOU NERVOUS?

97
00:06:20,166 --> 00:06:22,083
OR MAYBE YOU GOT SOMETHING
UNDER YOUR SLEEVE.

98
00:06:22,166 --> 00:06:24,791
WELL, HE MAY BE UNEMPLOYED
WITH NO FIXED ADDRESS,

99
00:06:24,875 --> 00:06:27,833
BUT HE DOES HAVE SOME FRIENDS
WHO'VE COME TO CHEER HIM ON

100
00:06:27,916 --> 00:06:29,916
FROM OUR SUPPORTERS BOX.

101
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,750
I CAN'T TELL WHAT
THEY'RE SAYING,

102
00:06:31,833 --> 00:06:34,375
BUT YOU CAN SURE SEE
THEY'RE ROOTING FOR HIM.

103
00:06:34,458 --> 00:06:38,375
- DURING THE PROGRAM, WE'LL BE
HAVING OUR "CATCH THE MISTAKE"

104
00:06:38,458 --> 00:06:41,916

105
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,458

SO MAKE SURE YOU STAY SHARP.

106
00:06:44,541 --> 00:06:47,291
AND THAT GOES FOR OUR
STUDIO AUDIENCE AS WELL.

107
00:06:47,375 --> 00:06:49,833

108
00:06:55,333 --> 00:06:57,083
AND HERE WE GO AGAIN.

109
00:06:57,166 --> 00:06:59,833
OUR NEXT QUIZ STARTS NOW.

110
00:06:59,916 --> 00:07:02,916
IT'S THE "WHO AM I?" QUIZ.
TELL US THE RULES.

111
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,125
- THE WHO AM I? QUIZ.
IN A FEW MOMENTS,

112
00:07:06,208 --> 00:07:09,333
THOUGHTS AND IMAGES RELATED
TO A CERTAIN PERSON WILL BE

113
00:07:09,416 --> 00:07:12,666
REVEALED TO YOU ONE AT A TIME
IN THE PANELS ON THE SCREEN.

114
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:15,083
USING THESE CLUES,
YOUR JOB IS TO TELL US

115
00:07:15,166 --> 00:07:16,916
WHO YOU THINK WE'RE
TALKING ABOUT.

116
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,166
THE SOONER YOU ANSWER CORRECTLY,
THE MORE POINTS YOU'LL GET.

117
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:22,750
- WOW, IF YOU GUESS CORRECTLY
AFTER THE FIRST HINT,

118
00:07:22,833 --> 00:07:25,000
YOU GET A WHOPPING
600,000 POINTS.

119
00:07:25,083 --> 00:07:26,708
BUT EVERY TIME WE HAVE TO
GIVE YOU A NEW CLUE,

120
00:07:26,791 --> 00:07:28,916
THE PRIZE IS REDUCED
BY 50,000 POINTS.

121
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,083
AND IF YOU ANSWER AFTER
ALL THE CLUES,

122
00:07:31,166 --> 00:07:32,666
AND YOU ONLY GET 50,000 POINTS.

123
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:34,708
IF YOU'RE READY,
LET'S GIVE IT A TRY.

124
00:07:34,791 --> 00:07:36,416
WHO AM I?

125
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:42,166
THEY LIKE TO WEAR BLACK.
IS IT SOMEONE

126
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:45,125
WHO'S VERY FASHION CONSCIOUS OR
MAYBE SOMEONE WHO'S IN MOURNING?

127
00:07:45,208 --> 00:07:47,333
I'LL BE AMAZED IF YOU CAN
GET THIS WITH ONE CLUE.

128
00:07:47,416 --> 00:07:49,208
THINK ABOUT IT.
- WEARS BLACK.

129
00:07:49,291 --> 00:07:51,708
- A MEAN LOOK IN THE EYES.

130
00:07:51,791 --> 00:07:53,833
SOMEONE WHO HAS MEAN
OR SCARY EYES.

131
00:07:53,916 --> 00:07:56,041
IS IT SOMEONE SCARY OR MAYBE
IT'S SOMEONE WITH POOR VISION.

132
00:07:56,125 --> 00:07:59,166
COME ON, VINCENT.
YOU CAN DO IT.

133
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:02,208
THEY APPEAR TO BE YOUNG, BUT
THEY'RE OLDER THAN THEY LOOK.

134
00:08:02,291 --> 00:08:05,291
HE'S GOT AN ANSWER.
IF HE ANSWERS CORRECTLY NOW,

135
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:08,208
HE'LL WALK AWAY
WITH 450,000 POINTS.

136
00:08:08,291 --> 00:08:10,916
HE'S SMILING.
SUCH CONFIDENCE.

137
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,166
SO LET'S HEAR YOUR ANSWER.
WHO AM I?

138
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:16,083
- RE-L MAYER.
- ( buzzer )

139
00:08:16,166 --> 00:08:18,416
THEY LIKE TO WEAR BLACK.

140
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:19,958
THEY HAVE A MEAN LOOK
IN THEIR EYES

141
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:22,208
AND THEY MAY BE OLDER
THAN THEY APPEAR.

142
00:08:22,291 --> 00:08:25,083
YOU GUESSED RE-L MAYER.
INCORRECT.

143
00:08:25,166 --> 00:08:28,791
NICE TRY.  WE HAVE RE-L MAYER
WITH US IN THE SUPPORTERS BOX.

144
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:31,541
HEY, RE-L, VINCENT THINKS
YOU'RE JUST AN OLD HAG.

145
00:08:31,625 --> 00:08:35,125
JUST KIDDING.
NOW BACK TO THE QUIZ.

146
00:08:35,208 --> 00:08:37,041
OUR AUDIENCE IS HANGING
ON THE EDGE OF THEIR SEAT.

147
00:08:37,125 --> 00:08:38,625
WHO AM I?

148
00:08:41,833 --> 00:08:43,708
THEY CAN WITHSTAND THE COLD.

149
00:08:43,791 --> 00:08:45,833
THAT WOULD MAKE ME WONDER
HOW THEY DO IN THE HEAT.

150
00:08:45,916 --> 00:08:49,083
MAYBE IT'S SIMPLY SOMEONE
WITH A LOT OF ENDURANCE.

151
00:08:49,166 --> 00:08:51,625
THEY'RE SHY.
THEY'RE THE TYPE OF PERSON

152
00:08:51,708 --> 00:08:53,708
WHO DOESN'T WANNA TALK
WHEN YOU FIRST MEET THEM.

153
00:08:53,791 --> 00:08:55,250
IT TAKES TIME FOR THEM
TO FEEL COMFORTABLE,

154
00:08:55,333 --> 00:08:58,458
BUT ONCE THEY DO,
WHO KNOWS HOW INTIMATE THEY GET?

155
00:08:58,541 --> 00:09:01,250
OH, THIS PERSON'S GOT
THEIR EYE ON VINCENT.

156
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:03,250
OH, MY GOODNESS.

157
00:09:03,333 --> 00:09:05,333
I THINK THAT'S A PRETTY
IMPORTANT CLUE, DON'T YOU?

158
00:09:05,416 --> 00:09:08,125
THEY'VE GOT THEIR EYE ON YOU.
DOES THAT MEAN OUR MYSTERY

159
00:09:08,208 --> 00:09:09,958
PERSON IS SOMEONE YOU KNOW?
- ( beeps )

160
00:09:10,041 --> 00:09:12,125
- ALL RIGHT, VINCENT.
ANSWER CORRECTLY RIGHT HERE

161
00:09:12,208 --> 00:09:14,208
AND YOU'LL RECEIVE
350,000 POINTS.

162
00:09:14,291 --> 00:09:16,458
WHO'S BEEN THINKING
ABOUT YOU A LOT LATELY?

163
00:09:16,541 --> 00:09:19,416
- PINO.
- ( buzzer )

164
00:09:21,208 --> 00:09:23,791
- IT'S JUST WHEN YOU SAID
THEY COULD WITHSTAND THE COLD,

165
00:09:23,875 --> 00:09:26,250
THE ONLY THING I COULD THINK OF
WAS AN AUTOREIV.

166
00:09:26,333 --> 00:09:27,958
- SERIOUSLY?  TAKE A LOOK.

167
00:09:28,041 --> 00:09:30,416
DOES THAT LOOK LIKE
A MEAN LOOK IN HER EYES?

168
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:33,416
WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?

169
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:35,875
PINO DOESN'T LIKE
TO WEAR A LOT OF BLACK

170
00:09:35,958 --> 00:09:38,166
NOR DOES SHE LOOK YOUNGER
THAN SHE ACTUALLY IS.

171
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:40,625
I DON'T KNOW HOW THIS AIRHEAD
ACT USUALLY WORKS OUT FOR YOU,

172
00:09:40,708 --> 00:09:43,000
BUT I THINK IT'S TIME
TO TRY SOMETHING NEW.

173
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:46,458
- I AM TRYING HERE.
- IF YOU SAY SO.

174
00:09:46,541 --> 00:09:50,166
NOW BACK TO THE QUIZ.

175
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:53,875
- THEY KEEP QUIET.
- NOT JUST QUIET.

176
00:09:53,958 --> 00:09:57,166
THEY'RE TOUTED FOR BEING
TORTUROUSLY TIGHTLIPPED.

177
00:09:57,250 --> 00:09:59,583
- THEY'RE QUIET
AND TEARFUL.

178
00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:02,000
- THEY ARE PRONE TO TEARS.
THINK ABOUT IT.

179
00:10:02,083 --> 00:10:03,541
YOU'RE RIGHT ON THE EDGE.
I CAN SEE IT.

180
00:10:03,625 --> 00:10:06,625
PRONE TO TEARS.
THAT'S A GREAT HINT.

181
00:10:06,708 --> 00:10:09,375
VERY TRUE.
A VERY GOOD WAY TO PUT IT.

182
00:10:09,458 --> 00:10:11,666
DEFINITELY SOMEONE WHO LIKES
TO WORK BEHIND THE SCENES.

183
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:14,166
I MEAN, COME ON,
THEY WEAR BLACK.

184
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:16,833
- WINNER.
- THEY ALWAYS WIN.

185
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:19,166
COME ON, YOU KNOW BY NOW,
DON'T YOU?

186
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:20,708
YOU'RE ALMOST OUT OF TIME.

187
00:10:20,791 --> 00:10:22,958
I CAN TELL THE ANSWER'S
ON THE TIP OF YOUR TONGUE.

188
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:26,208
NAKED UNDER BLUE SKIES.

189
00:10:26,291 --> 00:10:28,541
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT NAKED,
BUT BLUE SKIES?

190
00:10:28,625 --> 00:10:31,000
YOU EVER SEEN A BLUE SKY?
NAKED UNDER BLUE SKIES.

191
00:10:31,083 --> 00:10:33,666
BLUE SKIES OVER THEM
WHILE NAKED.

192
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:35,166
TIME'S RUNNING OUT
TAKE YOUR SHOT.

193
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:37,875
THIS IS IT.
YOUR LAST CHANCE.

194
00:10:37,958 --> 00:10:40,041
OUR MYSTERY PERSON
LIKES TO WEAR BLACK,

195
00:10:40,125 --> 00:10:41,875
HAS A MEAN LOOK IN THEIR EYES,

196
00:10:41,958 --> 00:10:44,208
IS ACTUALLY VERY OLD,
DESPITE HOW THEY LOOK.

197
00:10:44,291 --> 00:10:47,041
THEY CAN WITHSTAND THE COLD.
SHY AROUND STRANGERS.

198
00:10:47,125 --> 00:10:49,208
GOT VINCENT ON THEIR MIND.
PRONE TO TEARS.

199
00:10:49,291 --> 00:10:51,500
KEEPS THEIR MOUTH SHUT
FOR SOME REASON,

200
00:10:51,583 --> 00:10:53,250
BUT ALSO HAS A HIDDEN SIDE.

201
00:10:53,333 --> 00:10:55,375
THEY'RE A WINNER
AND NAKED UNDER BLUE SKIES.

202
00:10:55,458 --> 00:10:58,625
WHO AM I?
- IT'S ERGO PROXY.

203
00:10:58,708 --> 00:11:00,875
- ( buzzer )
- ( booing )

204
00:11:00,958 --> 00:11:04,750
- OUCH!
NO.  CLOSE, BUT NO CIGAR.

205
00:11:04,833 --> 00:11:06,041
THE ANSWER WAS...

206
00:11:06,125 --> 00:11:08,666
- Melody: THE CORRECT
ANSWER WAS PROXY ONE.

207
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:10,791
- WHAT?  WHO?

208
00:11:10,875 --> 00:11:14,750
- McQ: I'M AFRAID
THIS ROUND WAS A SHUTOUT.

209
00:11:17,291 --> 00:11:19,583
DON'T WORRY NOW.
'CAUSE WE'RE MOVING RIGHT ALONG.

210
00:11:19,666 --> 00:11:22,916
IT'S TIME FOR YOU TO GUESS THE
PICTURE IN THE "MOSAIC" QUIZ.

211
00:11:24,333 --> 00:11:27,666
- Melody: THE MOSAIC QUIZ
OR GUESS THE PICTURE.

212
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:31,250
IN A MOMENT, A PIXILATED IMAGE
WILL APPEAR ON THE MAIN SCREEN.

213
00:11:31,333 --> 00:11:33,666
USING THE PIXILATED IMAGE
AS A CLUE,

214
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:35,750
YOUR JOB IS TO TELL US WHAT
THE PICTURE IS OF

215
00:11:35,833 --> 00:11:37,208
AS SOON AS YOU THINK YOU KNOW.

216
00:11:37,291 --> 00:11:41,250
A CORRECT ANSWER WILL
EARN YOU 200,000 POINTS.

217
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:42,958
- WELL, SHALL WE START?

218
00:11:43,041 --> 00:11:44,375
HERE'S YOUR VERY FIRST PICTURE

219
00:11:44,458 --> 00:11:47,750
SO NOW TELL US WHAT IT'S
SUPPOSED TO BE.  Q-Q-Q-Q!

220
00:11:47,833 --> 00:11:49,750
- IT'S I GUESS--

221
00:11:49,833 --> 00:11:52,083
I CAN'T SEE A THING
THROUGH THAT--

222
00:11:52,166 --> 00:11:53,750
- REALLY?

223
00:11:53,833 --> 00:11:56,416
THEN MAYBE YOU SHOULD TRY
SQUINTING A LITTLE BIT, VINCENT.

224
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:59,125
SOMETIMES THAT CAN HELP.
KEEP LOOKING.  IT'S THERE.

225
00:11:59,208 --> 00:12:02,125
PERHAPS IT'S SOMETHING
YOU RECOGNIZE, SEEN BEFORE.

226
00:12:02,208 --> 00:12:06,083
HEY, THERE'S SOMETHING MOVING.
- IT LOOKS LIKE A BLOB TO ME.

227
00:12:06,166 --> 00:12:07,958
- BUT LOOK, IT'S GETTING BIGGER.
THAT'S RIGHT.

228
00:12:08,041 --> 00:12:10,333
IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S BEING
BRED, BORN AND RAISED.

229
00:12:10,416 --> 00:12:12,958
YOU CAN SEE IT'S GROWING.
SOMETHING THAT MOVES AND GROWS,

230
00:12:13,041 --> 00:12:14,833
SO IT MUST ALIVE.
- ALIVE, HUH?

231
00:12:14,916 --> 00:12:17,250
OH, YES, IT'S ALIVE.
ALTHOUGH NOT QUITE.

232
00:12:17,333 --> 00:12:19,625
I DON'T WANT TO GIVE IT AWAY,
BUT IT'S NOT EXACTLY ALIVE.

233
00:12:19,708 --> 00:12:21,333
IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S ALIVE,
BUT IT'S A LITTLE DIFFERENT.

234
00:12:21,416 --> 00:12:22,875
- IT LOOKS ALIVE.

235
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:25,750
- YES, NOT THAT THE FACT IS
ANYONE'S FAULT NECESSARILY.

236
00:12:25,833 --> 00:12:28,125
I MEAN THAT NOBODY COULD
HAVE POSSIBLY FORESEEN

237
00:12:28,208 --> 00:12:29,708
WHAT EVENTUALLY HAPPENED.

238
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:32,375
IT TOOK LONGER FOR THE PLANET'S
ENVIRONMENT TO RESTORE ITSELF

239
00:12:32,458 --> 00:12:35,291
TO THE PROPER CONDITIONS THAN
THE CREATORS HAD EXPECTED.

240
00:12:35,375 --> 00:12:39,125
THAT'S PROBABLY WHY THEIR
CALCULATIONS GOT SO MESSED UP.

241
00:12:39,208 --> 00:12:41,166
HERE'S A HINT.
TO SURVIVE WHAT HAPPENED,

242
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:42,833
THEY NEEDED TO BUILD THEMSELVES
A HUGE DOME.

243
00:12:42,916 --> 00:12:44,916
COME ON, THAT WAS A BIG HINT.
WHAT'S IN THE PICTURE?

244
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,833
- PEOPLE.
- ( buzzer )

245
00:12:46,916 --> 00:12:48,166
- ( audience clamoring )

246
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:51,625
- OOH!  SORRY, VINCENT,
THAT WAS A NICE TRY.

247
00:12:51,708 --> 00:12:53,416
SO CLOSE.
- MANKIND, HUMANS,

248
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:56,500
MEN AND WOMEN.
- GOOD GUESSES.

249
00:12:56,583 --> 00:13:00,041
WE'LL REVEAL THE ANSWER RIGHT
AFTER THESE IMPORTANT MESSAGES.

250
00:13:09,666 --> 00:13:11,708
- Melody:
The plan went into effect

251
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:13,750
in a much harsher
awakening environment

252
00:13:13,833 --> 00:13:16,833
than had been
originally anticipated.

253
00:13:16,916 --> 00:13:19,166
What proved to be the greatest
hurdle for the creators

254
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:22,166
under these harsh conditions
was the overabundance of data

255
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:23,500
that had been preserved,

256
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:26,208
particularly
"The Origin of Species."

257
00:13:26,291 --> 00:13:28,875
Within the major cities,
the need to adapt

258
00:13:28,958 --> 00:13:30,875
to an ever-changing
and fiercely harsh environment

259
00:13:30,958 --> 00:13:32,875
was unnecessary...

260
00:13:32,958 --> 00:13:35,500
- WE KNOW IT'S SOME SORT
OF BROADCAST SIGNAL

261
00:13:35,583 --> 00:13:37,166
OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN.

262
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:38,666
AN ANALYSIS OF ITS SOURCE
CONFIRMS THAT IT IS

263
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:42,416
BEING TRANSMITTED VIA SATELLITE
OF TERRESTRIAL ORIGIN.

264
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:45,250
- YOU'RE TELLING ME THAT SOMEONE
PUT A SATELLITE INTO ORBIT

265
00:13:45,333 --> 00:13:46,875
JUST SO THEY COULD
BROADCAST THIS?

266
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:48,791
- IT LOOKS THAT WAY, SIR.

267
00:13:48,875 --> 00:13:50,958
WE'RE CURRENTLY WORKING
WITH ALL RELEVANT DEPARTMENTS 

268
00:13:51,041 --> 00:13:53,625
TO DOUBLE CHECK
THE DOME'S JAMMING SYSTEM.

269
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:57,833
- RE-L.

270
00:13:57,916 --> 00:14:01,583
- Melody: But to admit failure,
the creators had to acknowledge

271
00:14:01,666 --> 00:14:04,791
that the true failure...
- VINCENT LAW.

272
00:14:04,875 --> 00:14:07,791
- ( audience cheering )

273
00:14:07,875 --> 00:14:09,916
- McQ: IT'S TIME WE MOVED ON
TO THE "TRIPLE CHANCE."

274
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,500
FOR THIS QUIZ,
ALL POINT VALUES ARE TRIPLED.

275
00:14:12,583 --> 00:14:15,791
AND JUST FOR FUN, WE'LL HAVE
THREE CONTESTANTS PLAY.

276
00:14:15,875 --> 00:14:17,291
RIGHT OVER HERE.

277
00:14:17,375 --> 00:14:20,125
NOW ALL OF YOU,
GOOD LUCK AND DO YOUR BEST.

278
00:14:20,208 --> 00:14:21,666
- VINCENT, WHAT THE HELL'S
GOING ON?

279
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:24,541
- HEY, LET'S TRY AND STAY
ON THE CARDS, YOUNG LADY.

280
00:14:24,625 --> 00:14:27,083
- ( audience laughs )

281
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:29,250
- WELL, IT'S TIME
TO GET BACK TO THE QUIZ.

282
00:14:29,333 --> 00:14:31,750
LET ME DIRECT YOUR EYES
TO THIS VIDEO PRESENTATION.

283
00:14:31,833 --> 00:14:34,375
Q-Q-Q-Q.

284
00:14:34,458 --> 00:14:37,583
- Melody:
THE HISTORY OF THE EARTH.

285
00:14:37,666 --> 00:14:40,625
BILLIONS OF YEARS AFTER
THE UNIVERSE WAS CREATED

286
00:14:40,708 --> 00:14:43,791
IN THE BIG BANG,
A STRANGE LITTLE PLANET WAS BORN

287
00:14:43,875 --> 00:14:45,916
ON THE EDGE
OF AN ORDINARY GALAXY.

288
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,333
THE NAME OF THE PLANET
WOULD ONE DAY BE EARTH.

289
00:14:48,416 --> 00:14:51,583
POOLS OF WATER BEGAN TO FORM,
BECOMING A MIRACULOUS OCEAN

290
00:14:51,666 --> 00:14:53,291
WITH SEAWEED AND FISH.

291
00:14:53,375 --> 00:14:55,500
MANY STRANGE THINGS HAPPENED
OVER THE NEXT FEW HUNDRED

292
00:14:55,583 --> 00:14:59,166
MILLION YEARS.  LATER ON DRY
LAND, DINOSAURS APPEARED.

293
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:01,333
THUS BEGAN THE LAW
OF THE JUNGLE.

294
00:15:01,416 --> 00:15:03,333
EAT, BE EATEN OR RUN AWAY.

295
00:15:03,416 --> 00:15:05,375
SOON WE CAME
TO THE AGE OF MAMMALS.

296
00:15:05,458 --> 00:15:07,958
HERE, OUR ANCESTORS WERE BORN.

297
00:15:08,041 --> 00:15:11,125
IN ORDER TO CATCH HIS PREY,
ONE OF THE ANCESTORS BY CHANCE

298
00:15:11,208 --> 00:15:13,125
RAISES THE BONE
HE'S HOLDING.

299
00:15:13,208 --> 00:15:16,833
YES! THIS IS THE MOMENT WHEN THE
FIRST TOOL CAME INTO EXISTENCE.

300
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:18,833
WAY TO GO, HUMANS.

301
00:15:18,916 --> 00:15:20,333
- THAT WAS AMAZING!

302
00:15:20,416 --> 00:15:22,708
- NOW WHILE KEEPING THE HISTORY
OF THE EARTH IN MIND,

303
00:15:22,791 --> 00:15:24,833
PREPARE TO WRITE YOUR ANSWERS
DOWN ON THE BOARDS

304
00:15:24,916 --> 00:15:26,125
WE'VE GIVEN THE THREE OF YOU.

305
00:15:26,208 --> 00:15:28,875
NOW IT'S TIME
FOR ANOTHER MOSAIC QUIZ.

306
00:15:28,958 --> 00:15:31,625
WHAT'S IT MAKING?
Q-Q-Q-Q!

307
00:15:31,708 --> 00:15:35,000
THIS IS RELATED TO THE BONE
THAT MONKEY WAS HOLDING.

308
00:15:35,083 --> 00:15:38,125
GIVE IT SOME REAL THOUGHT.  TIME

THAT'S RIGHT.
HERE'S A HINT-- AN EVOLVED TOOL.

310
00:15:40,875 --> 00:15:42,500
YOU'RE GETTING WARMER.
I CAN TELL.

311
00:15:42,583 --> 00:15:45,000
IT'S THE LAST ONE THEY MADE.
IT'S A BIG ONE.

312
00:15:45,083 --> 00:15:47,708
BUT IT WAS RUSHED.
NOT EVERYONE COULD USE IT

313
00:15:47,791 --> 00:15:50,375
SO IT WAS A BIT USELESS.  IT
FOSTERED WIDESPREAD RESENTMENT.

314
00:15:50,458 --> 00:15:54,250
YOU MUST KNOW WHAT IT IS BY NOW.
WHAT AM I GONNA DO WITH YOU?

315
00:15:54,333 --> 00:15:57,625
HERE'S A HINT-- SOMEONE USED IT
TO TRY TO GET AWAY FROM EARTH.

316
00:15:57,708 --> 00:16:01,833
ALL RIGHT,
THINKING TIME'S OVER.

317
00:16:01,916 --> 00:16:04,166
LET'S SHOW THE AUDIENCE
HOW OUR CONTESTANTS DID.

318
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:06,750
FIRST OFF, LITTLE PINO.

319
00:16:06,833 --> 00:16:08,750
OH, MY.  YOU DREW
THE PIXILATED IMAGE.

320
00:16:08,833 --> 00:16:11,541
INTERESTING, BUT NOT WHAT
WE'RE LOOKING FOR.

321
00:16:11,625 --> 00:16:13,541
NEXT, MISS MAYER.

324
00:16:18,666 --> 00:16:20,875
I DON'T KNOW.

THE APOCALYPSE IS AT HAND.

331
00:16:37,083 --> 00:16:40,208
THIS IS MANKIND'S LAST BEST HOPE
FOR ESCAPE FROM A WORLD

332
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:43,958
THAT'S HEADING FOR DESTRUCTION,
HUMANITY'S VERY OWN TRUMP CARD.

333
00:16:44,041 --> 00:16:47,375
SCIENCE HAD MADE INTERPLANETARY
EMIGRATION POSSIBLE.

334
00:16:47,458 --> 00:16:50,083
THIS WOULD BE THE LAST TOOL
MANUFACTURED HERE ON EARTH.

335
00:16:50,166 --> 00:16:52,416
COMPLETED THROUGH
THE INFUSION OF ULTIMATE WISDOM,

336
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:55,250
IT WAS A SPACESHIP BUILT
IN GEOSYNCHRONOUS ORBIT

337
00:16:55,333 --> 00:16:58,333
AND REFERRED
TO AS "THE EVACUATION SHIP."

338
00:16:58,416 --> 00:17:00,583

AN INTERPLANETARY SHIP BUILT
BY THE HUMAN RACE LONG AGO.

342
00:17:08,666 --> 00:17:12,208
- SO THE NUMBER OF POINTS
VINCENT CURRENTLY HAS IS?

343
00:17:12,291 --> 00:17:15,750
- JUST 90,000 POINTS!

344
00:17:15,833 --> 00:17:17,833

- AND WE'VE CUT TO COMMERCIAL.

349
00:17:27,166 --> 00:17:29,916
- HEY, THAT CLOSE-UP ON
THE LITTLE GIRL WAS AWFUL!

350
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,750
SHE WAS MAKING A FACE.

351
00:17:32,833 --> 00:17:34,666
- SORRY.  WE'LL TRY
TO BE MORE CAREFUL.

352
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:37,458
- DON'T WORRY, FOLKS.  I WAS
JUST TALKING TO THE DIRECTOR.

353
00:17:37,541 --> 00:17:39,708
- EXCUSE ME.

354
00:17:44,333 --> 00:17:45,916
- WHAT IS THIS?

355
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,458

369
00:18:33,125 --> 00:18:36,708
THIS IS YOUR LAST CHANCE
TO REACH ONE MILLION POINTS.

370
00:18:36,791 --> 00:18:38,375
- AND IF HE REACHES

371
00:18:38,458 --> 00:18:42,208
NOT ONLY DOES HE WIN,
