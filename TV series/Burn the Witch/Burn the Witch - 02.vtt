00:00:06.501 --> 00:00:09.133 position:24% line:89% align:start
(popping, clinking)

00:00:20.601 --> 00:00:22.133 position:13% line:5% align:start
Macy Baljure abruptly left

00:00:22.167 --> 00:00:24.434 position:16% line:83% align:start
the wildly popular girl
group Cecile Die Twice

00:00:24.467 --> 00:00:25.400 position:27% line:89% align:start
just last week.

00:00:25.434 --> 00:00:27.601 position:16% line:83% align:start
but there's been no word
of a press conference

00:00:27.634 --> 00:00:29.234 position:16% line:89% align:start
about her departure yet.

00:00:29.267 --> 00:00:30.534 position:16% line:89% align:start
Her silence is palpable.

00:00:30.567 --> 00:00:32.968 position:10% line:83% align:start
Do you think her being
replaced with a CG character

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.767 position:19% line:83% align:start
might've had something
to do with it?

00:00:34.801 --> 00:00:36.100 position:7% line:89% align:start
That's not quite correct, Tim.

00:00:36.133 --> 00:00:38.467 position:13% line:83% align:start
Cause you see, they're not
technically CG characters.

00:00:38.501 --> 00:00:40.400 position:19% line:83% align:start
They're called Vumans.
(audience laughing)

00:00:40.434 --> 00:00:43.000 position:10% line:83% align:start
Now, I know everyone's dying
to talk about this video

00:00:43.033 --> 00:00:45.267 position:7% line:83% align:start
that was leaked the other day.
Let's take a look.

00:00:47.367 --> 00:00:48.601 position:33% line:5% align:start
So annoying.

00:00:49.801 --> 00:00:51.100 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Host] That was the exact moment

00:00:51.133 --> 00:00:53.901 position:13% line:83% align:start
the group's leader, Ninny,
publicly denounced Macy!

00:00:53.934 --> 00:00:55.100 position:7% line:89% align:start
I don't know about, "leaked."

00:00:55.133 --> 00:00:57.067 position:21% line:83% align:start
This video is from
a reputable source.

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:58.968 position:16% line:83% align:start
It was on the Realist's
website after all.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.400 position:19% line:83% align:start
Exactly, it was
posted on the Realist.

00:01:01.434 --> 00:01:03.567 position:10% line:83% align:start
The only thing they're
good for is leaking gossip!

00:01:03.601 --> 00:01:06.033 position:35% line:89% align:start
(laughter)

00:01:07.467 --> 00:01:08.300 position:27% line:89% align:start
Thank you, Elly.

00:01:09.834 --> 00:01:11.000 position:19% line:89% align:start
You're so protective.

00:01:13.167 --> 00:01:14.467 position:24% line:89% align:start
You got mad for me.

00:01:15.501 --> 00:01:17.000 position:24% line:89% align:start
Thank you for that.

00:01:20.634 --> 00:01:22.901 position:13% line:5% align:start
Illegally rearing dragons?

00:01:22.934 --> 00:01:25.100 position:16% line:5% align:start
Yep. Or that's the word
on the street.

00:01:25.133 --> 00:01:27.300 position:13% line:5% align:start
We got a hot tip that
someone's doing just that

00:01:27.334 --> 00:01:29.467 position:21% line:83% align:start
in Reverse London's
west district.

00:01:29.501 --> 00:01:31.868 position:21% line:83% align:start
This'll be huge if
it's actually true.

00:01:31.901 --> 00:01:34.334 position:16% line:83% align:start
But why do we get stuck
taking care of it?

00:01:35.667 --> 00:01:38.000 position:27% line:89% align:start
Well, I mean...

00:01:38.033 --> 00:01:40.934 position:19% line:83% align:start
Our job is to rear and
take care of dragons.

00:01:40.968 --> 00:01:42.634 position:5% line:89% align:start
I guess illegally reared dragons

00:01:42.667 --> 00:01:44.267 position:10% line:89% align:start
count under that definition.

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:45.234 position:35% line:89% align:start
Seriously?

00:01:45.267 --> 00:01:46.901 position:16% line:89% align:start
That's a bit of a reach.

00:01:46.934 --> 00:01:48.100 position:19% line:89% align:start
Count yourself lucky.

00:01:48.133 --> 00:01:50.167 position:16% line:83% align:start
That "reach" is putting
money in your pocket.

00:01:54.934 --> 00:01:56.734 position:27% line:89% align:start
Oh, very mature.

00:01:56.767 --> 00:01:58.267 position:16% line:89% align:start
You did that on purpose.

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:59.067 position:35% line:89% align:start
Whoopsie.

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.167 position:24% line:89% align:start
Wow, did I do that?

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.801 position:5% line:83% align:start
Hey. It looks like all that cool
stuff you did yesterday

00:02:03.834 --> 00:02:06.234 position:21% line:83% align:start
didn't make it
into the newspaper.

00:02:06.267 --> 00:02:07.968 position:19% line:83% align:start
Even though you
saved the entire city

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.133 position:24% line:89% align:start
from a dark dragon.

00:02:10.467 --> 00:02:11.901 position:19% line:83% align:start
Well, that's only
because you're reading

00:02:11.934 --> 00:02:13.767 position:27% line:83% align:start
the Front London
articles, Balgo.

00:02:14.801 --> 00:02:16.300 position:5% line:89% align:start
Here's the Reverse London news.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.968 position:35% line:89% align:start
Amazing!

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.267 position:19% line:89% align:start
Look, it's you, Noel!

00:02:23.133 --> 00:02:25.467 position:10% line:89% align:start
Man, you look so super cool!

00:02:25.501 --> 00:02:27.567 position:13% line:83% align:start
Uh, hello?
I worked my butt off too.

00:02:27.601 --> 00:02:28.567 position:21% line:89% align:start
Thank you very much.

00:02:28.601 --> 00:02:29.634 position:30% line:89% align:start
Ah, found it!

00:02:29.667 --> 00:02:31.901 position:5% line:89% align:start
This is what I was looking for.

00:02:31.934 --> 00:02:33.934 position:19% line:89% align:start
Whoa, that was close.

00:02:33.968 --> 00:02:37.000 position:13% line:83% align:start
Forgot to share something
important with ya.

00:02:37.033 --> 00:02:40.267 position:13% line:83% align:start
The order came with a
small additional request.

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:42.267 position:38% line:89% align:start
(awing)

00:02:44.701 --> 00:02:46.200 position:10% line:89% align:start
Why in the world do we have

00:02:46.234 --> 00:02:47.901 position:24% line:83% align:start
to bring him along
with us anyway?

00:02:47.934 --> 00:02:49.133 position:13% line:89% align:start
It's like the chief said.

00:02:49.167 --> 00:02:50.934 position:21% line:83% align:start
Since Balgo draws
dragons toward him,

00:02:50.968 --> 00:02:52.901 position:19% line:83% align:start
he's the perfect lure
to bring them to us

00:02:52.934 --> 00:02:54.734 position:21% line:83% align:start
and help us round
them up efficiently.

00:02:54.767 --> 00:02:56.801 position:7% line:89% align:start
So we need him on the mission.

00:02:56.834 --> 00:02:58.067 position:19% line:89% align:start
Yeah I got that much!

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:00.000 position:7% line:89% align:start
I was in the room too, y'know.

00:03:00.667 --> 00:03:02.133 position:16% line:89% align:start
Then why are you so mad?

00:03:02.167 --> 00:03:04.601 position:10% line:83% align:start
I'm not mad because I didn't
understand the concept!

00:03:04.634 --> 00:03:07.100 position:7% line:83% align:start
I'm mad because I have doubts
about this whole thing!

00:03:07.133 --> 00:03:08.434 position:10% line:89% align:start
If you drew the short straw

00:03:08.467 --> 00:03:10.067 position:19% line:83% align:start
and had to look
after the class frog,

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:11.601 position:5% line:89% align:start
you'd be pissed about it, right?

00:03:11.634 --> 00:03:13.133 position:16% line:89% align:start
Like you'd still do it,

00:03:13.167 --> 00:03:16.300 position:5% line:83% align:start
but you wouldn't be happy
about it, you know what I mean?

00:03:16.334 --> 00:03:18.467 position:16% line:83% align:start
Balgo, she seems to have
taken issue with you.

00:03:18.501 --> 00:03:20.467 position:21% line:83% align:start
Do you have anything
to say about that?

00:03:20.767 --> 00:03:22.133 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yup!

00:03:22.167 --> 00:03:24.734 position:13% line:83% align:start
I'm so glad whatever weird
dragon-summon-y thing

00:03:24.767 --> 00:03:27.901 position:10% line:83% align:start
that's going on with my body
will help you out, Noel!

00:03:27.934 --> 00:03:30.467 position:24% line:83% align:start
And if my arms
start to slide up,

00:03:30.501 --> 00:03:32.434 position:21% line:83% align:start
they might brush
against your boobs.

00:03:32.467 --> 00:03:34.934 position:24% line:83% align:start
Just the thought
of getting to bask

00:03:34.968 --> 00:03:37.400 position:13% line:83% align:start
in the warm aura emanating
from your body...

00:03:37.434 --> 00:03:39.067 position:30% line:89% align:start
(giggle/sigh)

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:40.467 position:16% line:89% align:start
I'm a very blessed man.

00:03:40.501 --> 00:03:42.000 position:24% line:89% align:start
I could die happy.

00:03:42.033 --> 00:03:44.434 position:19% line:83% align:start
You do realize that if
I drop you right now,

00:03:44.467 --> 00:03:45.267 position:21% line:89% align:start
you'll probably die.

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:46.467 position:41% line:89% align:start
Right?

00:03:46.501 --> 00:03:47.300 position:33% line:89% align:start
[Balgo] Huh?

00:03:53.367 --> 00:03:54.267 position:27% line:89% align:start
[Noel] Oh, yeah.

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:56.000 position:21% line:83% align:start
I have something
to give you, Balgo.

00:03:56.934 --> 00:03:58.400 position:33% line:89% align:start
Here you go.

00:03:58.434 --> 00:04:00.901 position:24% line:83% align:start
This is a Piper's
mantle and pipe.

00:04:00.934 --> 00:04:02.367 position:7% line:89% align:start
You'll be working with us now.

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.601 position:13% line:83% align:start
So the chief thought it
would be for the best if,

00:04:04.634 --> 00:04:07.300 position:10% line:83% align:start
at the very least, you
could try to look the part.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.934 position:24% line:89% align:start
Look the part huh?

00:04:10.968 --> 00:04:13.100 position:16% line:83% align:start
Like, could that pipe be
any more fake-looking?

00:04:15.501 --> 00:04:16.901 position:21% line:89% align:start
You sure look happy.

00:04:16.934 --> 00:04:19.601 position:19% line:83% align:start
You wanted to wear one
of those that badly?

00:04:19.634 --> 00:04:21.067 position:19% line:89% align:start
Yeah, of course I did!

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:24.133 position:16% line:83% align:start
I mean, wearing the same
thing as Noel wears...

00:04:24.167 --> 00:04:27.467 position:13% line:83% align:start
It feels like she's
holding me nice and tight.

00:04:27.501 --> 00:04:29.901 position:24% line:89% align:start
It's the best ever!

00:04:29.934 --> 00:04:31.133 position:30% line:89% align:start
[Ninny] Gross.

00:04:32.968 --> 00:04:34.934 position:21% line:83% align:start
Well? We're in the
west district now...

00:04:34.968 --> 00:04:36.000 position:19% line:89% align:start
Do you feel anything?

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.801 position:16% line:89% align:start
Like personal feelings?

00:04:38.834 --> 00:04:40.100 position:30% line:89% align:start
No you dummy!

00:04:40.133 --> 00:04:41.300 position:19% line:89% align:start
More like the presence

00:04:41.334 --> 00:04:43.133 position:19% line:83% align:start
of an illegally reared
dragon or whatever!

00:04:43.167 --> 00:04:45.434 position:10% line:83% align:start
I hate to burst your bubble
but that's impossible.

00:04:46.167 --> 00:04:47.801 position:27% line:83% align:start
I just naturally
attract dragons.

00:04:47.834 --> 00:04:48.801 position:24% line:89% align:start
It's pretty random.

00:04:48.834 --> 00:04:50.267 position:7% line:89% align:start
I don't have a special ability

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:51.801 position:19% line:83% align:start
that lets me
communicate with them,

00:04:51.834 --> 00:04:52.968 position:7% line:89% align:start
if that's what you're asking.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.634 position:24% line:83% align:start
Then why the hell
are you even here

00:04:54.667 --> 00:04:55.801 position:16% line:89% align:start
cramping our style, man?

00:04:55.834 --> 00:04:56.801 position:27% line:89% align:start
You're useless!

00:04:56.834 --> 00:04:59.300 position:33% line:89% align:start
(explosion)

00:04:59.334 --> 00:05:00.334 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hm?

00:05:02.467 --> 00:05:03.467 position:30% line:89% align:start
An explosion!

00:05:03.501 --> 00:05:04.801 position:33% line:89% align:start
That's bad.

00:05:04.834 --> 00:05:06.567 position:33% line:89% align:start
(whistling)

00:05:06.601 --> 00:05:07.801 position:30% line:89% align:start
Looks like it.

00:05:07.834 --> 00:05:09.067 position:27% line:89% align:start
"Looks like it"?

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:11.267 position:19% line:83% align:start
Aren't you gonna go
down there and check?

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:12.834 position:7% line:89% align:start
It's out of our jurisdiction.

00:05:12.868 --> 00:05:15.133 position:16% line:83% align:start
Dealing with terrorists
is the police's job.

00:05:16.334 --> 00:05:17.334 position:35% line:89% align:start
Let's go.

00:05:17.367 --> 00:05:19.434 position:21% line:83% align:start
There's a chance it
might be a dragon.

00:05:19.467 --> 00:05:20.334 position:27% line:89% align:start
Well said, Noel.

00:05:21.801 --> 00:05:23.467 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Noel] Even if
it's not a dragon,

00:05:23.501 --> 00:05:26.100 position:24% line:83% align:start
we'll probably get
points for going.

00:05:26.133 --> 00:05:27.934 position:24% line:89% align:start
You got me. Fine.

00:05:27.968 --> 00:05:29.634 position:5% line:89% align:start
I just have to go there, right?

00:05:29.667 --> 00:05:30.667 position:35% line:89% align:start
That's it?

00:05:37.834 --> 00:05:40.434 position:19% line:83% align:start
This is the Realist's
headquarters.

00:05:40.467 --> 00:05:42.901 position:16% line:83% align:start
Yeah you could see that
from where we were.

00:05:42.934 --> 00:05:45.434 position:24% line:83% align:start
That's why I didn't
wanna bother coming.

00:05:45.467 --> 00:05:46.234 position:33% line:89% align:start
The Realist?

00:05:46.267 --> 00:05:47.634 position:19% line:89% align:start
You mean the tabloid?

00:05:48.767 --> 00:05:49.801 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hm?

00:05:49.834 --> 00:05:50.934 position:24% line:83% align:start
-Huh...
-Ninny, over here.

00:05:50.968 --> 00:05:53.133 position:24% line:83% align:start
The other day, they
did a piece on you.

00:05:53.167 --> 00:05:55.634 position:10% line:83% align:start
They post stories about me,
like, three times a week.

00:05:55.667 --> 00:05:57.300 position:24% line:89% align:start
Be more specific.

00:05:57.334 --> 00:05:59.567 position:21% line:83% align:start
It had a video of you
saying something like,

00:05:59.601 --> 00:06:00.701 position:30% line:89% align:start
"So annoying."

00:06:00.734 --> 00:06:03.167 position:13% line:83% align:start
It made you sound like you
were calling Macy annoying

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:05.767 position:7% line:83% align:start
after she left the group,
like you hated her and stuff.

00:06:06.934 --> 00:06:08.100 position:33% line:89% align:start
Interesting.

00:06:08.133 --> 00:06:10.334 position:16% line:83% align:start
So that's how the media
ended up spinning it.

00:06:11.868 --> 00:06:14.234 position:21% line:83% align:start
There doesn't seem
to be anyone inside.

00:06:14.267 --> 00:06:16.133 position:16% line:89% align:start
Well, it is a Saturday.

00:06:16.167 --> 00:06:18.167 position:7% line:89% align:start
Not that our boss even cares.

00:06:19.434 --> 00:06:20.434 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:06:23.501 --> 00:06:24.501 position:35% line:89% align:start
Marshal!

00:06:29.334 --> 00:06:30.334 position:41% line:89% align:start
Ninny?

00:06:31.334 --> 00:06:32.634 position:35% line:89% align:start
I'm going.

00:06:32.667 --> 00:06:34.133 position:19% line:89% align:start
[Balgo] I'll come too!

00:06:34.167 --> 00:06:36.467 position:10% line:83% align:start
This is dangerous, so please
keep your distance, Balgo.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:38.100 position:38% line:89% align:start
Aw man!

00:06:40.767 --> 00:06:42.467 position:27% line:89% align:start
(glass shatters)

00:06:42.501 --> 00:06:44.601 position:35% line:89% align:start
(grunts)

00:06:52.667 --> 00:06:55.601 position:7% line:89% align:start
So, it was you I saw up here.

00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:58.300 position:30% line:89% align:start
[Macy] What...

00:06:58.334 --> 00:07:00.534 position:7% line:89% align:start
What're you doing here, Nina?

00:07:00.567 --> 00:07:01.534 position:35% line:89% align:start
Nice try.

00:07:01.567 --> 00:07:02.734 position:24% line:89% align:start
But that's my line.

00:07:02.767 --> 00:07:03.968 position:13% line:89% align:start
So let's cut to the chase.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.133 position:21% line:83% align:start
What are you doing
in Reverse London...

00:07:07.934 --> 00:07:10.300 position:41% line:89% align:start
Macy?

00:07:10.334 --> 00:07:13.901 position:7% line:83% align:start
[Macy] This company wrote a
really mean article about us.

00:07:13.934 --> 00:07:16.300 position:19% line:83% align:start
They even said that
you actually hate me.

00:07:17.133 --> 00:07:18.567 position:16% line:89% align:start
That's not what I mean.

00:07:18.601 --> 00:07:19.968 position:24% line:89% align:start
You realize this is

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000 position:19% line:83% align:start
the Realist's Reverse
London headquarters.

00:07:22.033 --> 00:07:23.968 position:16% line:83% align:start
It was the Front London
branch of the Realists

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:24.968 position:16% line:89% align:start
who wrote that article.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:26.801 position:27% line:89% align:start
Ugh, seriously!

00:07:26.834 --> 00:07:28.968 position:13% line:89% align:start
They always writes pieces

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:30.467 position:24% line:83% align:start
which twist things
out of context

00:07:30.501 --> 00:07:32.601 position:27% line:83% align:start
and make you look
like a bad person.

00:07:33.868 --> 00:07:35.601 position:19% line:83% align:start
That's why I came
here to destroy them.

00:07:35.634 --> 00:07:37.067 position:24% line:89% align:start
Honestly it's fine.

00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:39.634 position:19% line:83% align:start
I'm used to that
kind of crap, really.

00:07:39.667 --> 00:07:40.968 position:38% line:89% align:start
Wait...

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.234 position:19% line:89% align:start
What did you just say?

00:07:43.267 --> 00:07:46.133 position:19% line:83% align:start
Were you the one who
caused that explosion?

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:48.000 position:30% line:89% align:start
Of course not.

00:07:48.934 --> 00:07:51.100 position:16% line:89% align:start
I didn't do any of this.

00:07:51.133 --> 00:07:53.033 position:7% line:89% align:start
This little one did it for me.

00:07:54.367 --> 00:07:55.667 position:33% line:89% align:start
A dragon...

00:07:55.701 --> 00:07:57.467 position:5% line:89% align:start
And it's already grown that big?

00:07:59.367 --> 00:08:00.701 position:41% line:89% align:start
Macy.

00:08:00.734 --> 00:08:02.133 position:24% line:89% align:start
Just give it to me.

00:08:02.934 --> 00:08:04.934 position:13% line:89% align:start
[Macy] She's not an "it."

00:08:04.968 --> 00:08:06.167 position:24% line:89% align:start
Her name is Elly.

00:08:07.300 --> 00:08:08.934 position:7% line:89% align:start
There's no way you'd know this

00:08:08.968 --> 00:08:10.200 position:21% line:83% align:start
since you're not
from Reverse London,

00:08:10.234 --> 00:08:12.400 position:13% line:83% align:start
so I'm gonna bend the
rules for you just a bit.

00:08:12.434 --> 00:08:15.701 position:13% line:83% align:start
But here, physical contact
with a dragon is a felony.

00:08:15.734 --> 00:08:18.801 position:5% line:83% align:start
As long as I keep my mouth shut
about this, you'll be fine,

00:08:18.834 --> 00:08:21.234 position:13% line:89% align:start
So please let me take it.

00:08:21.267 --> 00:08:22.100 position:35% line:89% align:start
I won't.

00:08:22.133 --> 00:08:24.167 position:24% line:83% align:start
Listen up, this is
for your own good!

00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:26.601 position:10% line:83% align:start
If they find out about this,
they'll have you killed!

00:08:26.634 --> 00:08:27.968 position:16% line:89% align:start
Why would I believe you?

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:29.934 position:21% line:83% align:start
Who taught me never
to trust anyone

00:08:29.968 --> 00:08:32.467 position:16% line:83% align:start
who tries to say, "this
is for your own good?"

00:08:33.667 --> 00:08:35.100 position:24% line:89% align:start
It was you, Nina!

00:08:42.334 --> 00:08:43.133 position:41% line:89% align:start
Elly?

00:08:44.667 --> 00:08:46.133 position:13% line:89% align:start
You don't look very happy

00:08:46.167 --> 00:08:49.133 position:21% line:83% align:start
considering we just
found our dragon.

00:08:49.167 --> 00:08:51.801 position:10% line:83% align:start
If I was happy after finding
out someone I knew did it,

00:08:51.834 --> 00:08:52.801 position:27% line:89% align:start
I'd be a psycho.

00:08:52.834 --> 00:08:54.033 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:08:54.934 --> 00:08:57.467 position:5% line:89% align:start
I see, so are you Macy Baljure?

00:08:57.501 --> 00:08:58.667 position:35% line:89% align:start
I'm sorry.

00:08:58.701 --> 00:09:01.601 position:5% line:83% align:start
You don't look like how I'd
pictured you, so I wasn't sure.

00:09:04.667 --> 00:09:07.434 position:19% line:89% align:start
Who the hell are you?

00:09:07.467 --> 00:09:08.734 position:27% line:89% align:start
(startled gasps)

00:09:08.767 --> 00:09:11.767 position:10% line:83% align:start
And why are you talking like
you're Nina's best friend?

00:09:11.801 --> 00:09:13.667 position:16% line:89% align:start
You have a lot of nerve!

00:09:13.701 --> 00:09:15.434 position:19% line:89% align:start
I'm gonna murder you!

00:09:15.467 --> 00:09:17.234 position:24% line:89% align:start
(heavy breathing)

00:09:17.267 --> 00:09:20.000 position:16% line:83% align:start
It's awkward but she's
kind of in love with me.

00:09:20.033 --> 00:09:22.067 position:16% line:83% align:start
She does this when girls
are friendly with me.

00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:23.767 position:24% line:89% align:start
It's not personal.

00:09:23.801 --> 00:09:27.501 position:7% line:83% align:start
She thinks I was being
friendly with you back there?

00:09:27.534 --> 00:09:29.300 position:24% line:89% align:start
(heavy breathing)

00:09:29.334 --> 00:09:30.734 position:10% line:83% align:start
-Where the hell did you go?
-Anyway,

00:09:30.767 --> 00:09:31.968 position:7% line:89% align:start
the direct approach won't work

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:33.968 position:21% line:83% align:start
when she's already
riled up like this.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:35.834 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'm gonna try to go
in from the roof.

00:09:35.868 --> 00:09:38.467 position:16% line:83% align:start
You keep her distracted
from there, okay?

00:09:38.501 --> 00:09:39.467 position:33% line:89% align:start
Ninny, wait!

00:09:40.467 --> 00:09:43.000 position:33% line:89% align:start
(explosion)

00:09:43.767 --> 00:09:44.767 position:41% line:89% align:start
Ninny!

00:09:49.467 --> 00:09:50.934 position:38% line:89% align:start
Whoops.

00:09:50.968 --> 00:09:53.334 position:21% line:83% align:start
She flew way further
than I expected.

00:10:07.601 --> 00:10:10.334 position:16% line:83% align:start
What do you think
you're doing, Banx Jr.?

00:10:11.300 --> 00:10:13.434 position:16% line:83% align:start
And what brings you to
the Crown Council today?

00:10:13.467 --> 00:10:17.100 position:10% line:83% align:start
Oh, uh well, I was just
uh, taking a little stroll.

00:10:18.767 --> 00:10:20.567 position:10% line:89% align:start
It's pointless to lie to me.

00:10:20.601 --> 00:10:23.467 position:7% line:83% align:start
You probably realized your
subordinates were in trouble.

00:10:23.501 --> 00:10:24.467 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:10:24.501 --> 00:10:26.234 position:21% line:83% align:start
Did something happen
to em out there?

00:10:28.968 --> 00:10:30.467 position:24% line:89% align:start
On second thought.

00:10:30.501 --> 00:10:32.667 position:13% line:83% align:start
It would appear that I may
have overestimated you.

00:10:34.968 --> 00:10:37.067 position:16% line:83% align:start
Given that you are their
superior, after all.

00:10:37.100 --> 00:10:39.767 position:13% line:83% align:start
I think it would be wrong
if I didn't inform you.

00:10:40.968 --> 00:10:43.300 position:13% line:89% align:start
Last night at 22:00 hours,

00:10:43.334 --> 00:10:47.133 position:10% line:83% align:start
an order for the elimination
of Balgo Parks was issued.

00:10:47.167 --> 00:10:49.567 position:21% line:83% align:start
While it hasn't been
carried out yet,

00:10:49.601 --> 00:10:52.434 position:21% line:83% align:start
I hear Bangnyfe is
already on the move.

00:10:53.467 --> 00:10:55.601 position:16% line:83% align:start
I'm sure you're familiar
with the way he works.

00:10:55.634 --> 00:10:58.300 position:10% line:83% align:start
I would watch out for my
subordinates if I were you.

00:10:59.767 --> 00:11:00.767 position:24% line:89% align:start
Let's go, Arkvine.

00:11:01.834 --> 00:11:03.167 position:19% line:89% align:start
[Arkvine] Yes, ma'am.

00:11:07.167 --> 00:11:09.434 position:19% line:83% align:start
Well, that ain't good.
I'll tell you that.

00:11:12.601 --> 00:11:14.067 position:16% line:89% align:start
She's not dead, is she?

00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:16.467 position:19% line:83% align:start
I'll have to write up
a report if she is,

00:11:16.501 --> 00:11:18.734 position:21% line:89% align:start
and paperwork sucks.

00:11:18.767 --> 00:11:20.467 position:24% line:89% align:start
Hold on, you are?

00:11:20.501 --> 00:11:22.634 position:21% line:83% align:start
Looks like you know
who I am already.

00:11:22.667 --> 00:11:25.033 position:13% line:89% align:start
Guess that's no surprise.

00:11:25.067 --> 00:11:27.267 position:24% line:83% align:start
But then I know who
you two are as well.

00:11:28.634 --> 00:11:29.734 position:24% line:89% align:start
Sorry, who are you?

00:11:29.767 --> 00:11:30.767 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:11:31.834 --> 00:11:34.100 position:10% line:89% align:start
His name is Bruno Bangnyfe.

00:11:36.868 --> 00:11:38.801 position:24% line:83% align:start
He's one of the
Top of the Horns.

00:11:38.834 --> 00:11:41.434 position:7% line:89% align:start
And the director of the Inks.

00:11:42.968 --> 00:11:45.801 position:24% line:83% align:start
But what the hell
is he doing here?

00:11:45.834 --> 00:11:46.801 position:35% line:89% align:start
Finally.

00:11:46.834 --> 00:11:49.100 position:5% line:89% align:start
At least someone knows who I am.

00:11:49.133 --> 00:11:50.801 position:21% line:83% align:start
You got some nerve,
pissing me off.

00:11:50.834 --> 00:11:52.033 position:30% line:89% align:start
But whatever.

00:11:53.834 --> 00:11:55.067 position:35% line:89% align:start
It's me.

00:11:55.100 --> 00:11:57.234 position:24% line:83% align:start
Dragon blockade at
Penfront Street.

00:11:57.267 --> 00:11:59.634 position:10% line:83% align:start
Get rid of all the
bystanders and clear em out

00:11:59.667 --> 00:12:01.934 position:21% line:83% align:start
with the exception of
the Wing Bind employee

00:12:01.968 --> 00:12:03.400 position:19% line:89% align:start
positioned down there.

00:12:03.434 --> 00:12:05.100 position:21% line:83% align:start
Don't worry, you'll
be able to tell

00:12:05.133 --> 00:12:08.167 position:10% line:83% align:start
who the Wing Bind employee
is from his Piper's mantle.

00:12:09.801 --> 00:12:11.667 position:10% line:89% align:start
Take your hands off of him!

00:12:21.167 --> 00:12:24.167 position:7% line:83% align:start
And you detain that Wing Bind
employee when you find him.

00:12:25.601 --> 00:12:28.434 position:10% line:83% align:start
He's the mastermind behind
the dragon terrorist attack

00:12:28.467 --> 00:12:29.267 position:24% line:89% align:start
that just happened.

00:12:30.501 --> 00:12:31.467 position:35% line:89% align:start
I get it.

00:12:31.501 --> 00:12:32.767 position:27% line:89% align:start
So that means...

00:12:33.901 --> 00:12:35.567 position:24% line:83% align:start
You're the one who
ordered the chief

00:12:35.601 --> 00:12:37.133 position:16% line:89% align:start
to give him that mantle.

00:12:38.167 --> 00:12:40.400 position:16% line:89% align:start
Makes sense, doesn't it?

00:12:40.434 --> 00:12:43.701 position:7% line:83% align:start
A dragonclad with dragon
powers decides to get revenge.

00:12:43.734 --> 00:12:44.901 position:13% line:89% align:start
On the very tabloid office

00:12:44.934 --> 00:12:46.801 position:21% line:83% align:start
that turned him into
a laughing stock

00:12:46.834 --> 00:12:49.334 position:7% line:89% align:start
and made jokes at his expense.

00:12:49.367 --> 00:12:50.501 position:44% line:89% align:start
Eh?

00:12:50.534 --> 00:12:53.467 position:10% line:83% align:start
Not that I really care if it
makes sense to you or not.

00:12:53.501 --> 00:12:55.167 position:24% line:89% align:start
You're messed up.

00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:57.100 position:13% line:83% align:start
I don't understand the
purpose of framing Balgo.

00:12:57.133 --> 00:12:59.434 position:16% line:83% align:start
What good could
possibly come from that?

00:12:59.467 --> 00:13:00.968 position:24% line:89% align:start
Oh, plenty of good!

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.067 position:13% line:89% align:start
At 22:00 hours last night,

00:13:03.100 --> 00:13:06.067 position:7% line:83% align:start
a Punitive Dragon Designation
and Elimination Order

00:13:06.100 --> 00:13:08.067 position:10% line:89% align:start
was issued for Balgo Parks.

00:13:08.100 --> 00:13:11.734 position:10% line:83% align:start
In just a few hours there'll
be a bounty on his head.

00:13:11.767 --> 00:13:12.968 position:13% line:89% align:start
And whoever takes him out

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.801 position:19% line:83% align:start
will secure themselves
a guaranteed place

00:13:15.834 --> 00:13:18.267 position:13% line:89% align:start
in Reverse London history.

00:13:18.300 --> 00:13:19.467 position:38% line:89% align:start
(gasps)

00:13:19.501 --> 00:13:22.400 position:10% line:83% align:start
So for the time being, I'll
just be taking the guy in.

00:13:22.434 --> 00:13:24.567 position:16% line:83% align:start
But as soon as the
order goes into effect,

00:13:24.601 --> 00:13:26.067 position:13% line:89% align:start
I'll kill him on the spot.

00:13:27.501 --> 00:13:29.801 position:19% line:83% align:start
Don't even try crying
or negotiating.

00:13:29.834 --> 00:13:33.467 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'm still working under the
Dragon Contact Prohibition Law.

00:13:33.501 --> 00:13:35.000 position:24% line:89% align:start
Like I said before,

00:13:35.033 --> 00:13:37.267 position:19% line:83% align:start
I don't plan on taking
the two of you out,

00:13:38.133 --> 00:13:40.467 position:21% line:83% align:start
as long as you
stay out of my way.

00:13:40.501 --> 00:13:42.300 position:24% line:89% align:start
Excuse me, Bruno.

00:13:42.334 --> 00:13:43.133 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:13:44.234 --> 00:13:46.601 position:19% line:83% align:start
You have the worst dye
job I've ever seen.

00:13:46.634 --> 00:13:48.400 position:16% line:89% align:start
The hell'd you just say?

00:13:48.434 --> 00:13:49.601 position:30% line:89% align:start
I'll kill you!

00:13:51.300 --> 00:13:52.734 position:41% line:89% align:start
Niiha!

00:13:52.767 --> 00:13:53.968 position:24% line:89% align:start
What's the problem?

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.334 position:24% line:83% align:start
I did nothing that
requires scolding.

00:13:56.367 --> 00:13:57.167 position:33% line:89% align:start
I know that!

00:13:58.501 --> 00:14:01.567 position:13% line:83% align:start
I was gonna compliment you
and say "nice burn" there.

00:14:01.601 --> 00:14:04.334 position:7% line:83% align:start
Well, it didn't exactly
warrant a compliment, either.

00:14:05.501 --> 00:14:07.167 position:30% line:89% align:start
You know what?

00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:09.734 position:10% line:83% align:start
I was trying to be nice
'cause you're just lackeys,

00:14:09.767 --> 00:14:11.467 position:13% line:89% align:start
but you had to get cocky.

00:14:11.501 --> 00:14:14.934 position:5% line:83% align:start
This'll definitely be an
"accident on the job" situation.

00:14:14.968 --> 00:14:17.000 position:21% line:83% align:start
And it'll totally be
worth the paperwork!

00:14:18.501 --> 00:14:20.667 position:19% line:83% align:start
Wait, dammit, what the
hell are you doing?

00:14:20.701 --> 00:14:22.100 position:10% line:89% align:start
Why aren't you coming at me?

00:14:24.767 --> 00:14:25.934 position:38% line:89% align:start
Let go!

00:14:25.968 --> 00:14:26.934 position:33% line:89% align:start
You idiots!

00:14:26.968 --> 00:14:28.067 position:35% line:89% align:start
Look up!

00:14:28.100 --> 00:14:29.100 position:27% line:89% align:start
Put up a shield!

00:14:30.367 --> 00:14:32.601 position:33% line:89% align:start
(screaming)

00:14:34.501 --> 00:14:35.501 position:41% line:89% align:start
Magic?

00:14:39.634 --> 00:14:41.300 position:19% line:89% align:start
Get a picture, quick!

00:14:41.334 --> 00:14:42.734 position:41% line:89% align:start
Noel?

00:14:42.767 --> 00:14:44.868 position:7% line:89% align:start
You came to rescue lil ole me?

00:14:44.901 --> 00:14:46.801 position:5% line:89% align:start
Well if you look at it that way.

00:14:46.834 --> 00:14:49.567 position:13% line:83% align:start
Then yes, you were rescued
as a result of my actions.

00:14:49.601 --> 00:14:50.934 position:35% line:89% align:start
Awesome!

00:14:50.968 --> 00:14:52.100 position:16% line:89% align:start
Though, full disclosure,

00:14:52.133 --> 00:14:54.267 position:19% line:83% align:start
I have no idea what's
going on right now!

00:14:54.300 --> 00:14:55.300 position:41% line:89% align:start
Go me!

00:14:57.834 --> 00:14:59.033 position:35% line:89% align:start
Damn it!

00:15:02.634 --> 00:15:03.501 position:21% line:89% align:start
I have one question.

00:15:06.133 --> 00:15:08.300 position:5% line:89% align:start
This isn't how it usually works,

00:15:08.334 --> 00:15:11.100 position:19% line:83% align:start
but I guess that's how
you Pipers operate.

00:15:11.133 --> 00:15:12.767 position:7% line:89% align:start
So are you the one responsible

00:15:12.801 --> 00:15:14.734 position:27% line:83% align:start
for bringing Macy
to Reverse London?

00:15:14.767 --> 00:15:17.934 position:10% line:83% align:start
And why does she suddenly
have a dragon with her now?

00:15:17.968 --> 00:15:19.901 position:16% line:83% align:start
Why couldn't you just
keep it to one question,

00:15:19.934 --> 00:15:21.167 position:16% line:89% align:start
you greedy little brat?

00:15:23.601 --> 00:15:24.968 position:35% line:89% align:start
All right.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:26.767 position:19% line:83% align:start
I scouted her and
brought her over here.

00:15:27.834 --> 00:15:29.300 position:21% line:83% align:start
She'd somehow
managed to discover

00:15:29.334 --> 00:15:32.167 position:13% line:83% align:start
a baby dragon in Front
London and was raising it.

00:15:33.601 --> 00:15:36.434 position:16% line:83% align:start
I'm sure you want to pin
that dragon on me, too,

00:15:36.467 --> 00:15:38.100 position:24% line:89% align:start
but that wasn't me.

00:15:38.133 --> 00:15:39.467 position:16% line:89% align:start
Your little friend there

00:15:39.501 --> 00:15:42.100 position:10% line:83% align:start
is one of those rare
people born in Front London

00:15:42.133 --> 00:15:44.267 position:19% line:83% align:start
who happens to possess
a high amount of mana.

00:15:45.934 --> 00:15:47.167 position:27% line:89% align:start
She's a Watcher.

00:15:51.300 --> 00:15:54.133 position:7% line:89% align:start
Did you say Macy's a Watcher?

00:15:55.267 --> 00:15:58.467 position:5% line:83% align:start
She would've ended up in
Reverse London sooner or later.

00:15:58.501 --> 00:16:01.901 position:10% line:83% align:start
Just like you and your other
buddy Noel Niihashi did.

00:16:01.934 --> 00:16:03.133 position:41% line:89% align:start
Right?

00:16:05.133 --> 00:16:07.968 position:10% line:83% align:start
Pro tip: don't be so on
edge holding your Witch Kit.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:09.767 position:19% line:83% align:start
What if it
accidentally goes off?

00:16:13.434 --> 00:16:14.667 position:30% line:89% align:start
What the hell?

00:16:20.434 --> 00:16:21.434 position:41% line:89% align:start
Nina!

00:16:22.501 --> 00:16:24.000 position:27% line:89% align:start
[Ninny] Marshal!

00:16:29.767 --> 00:16:30.767 position:35% line:89% align:start
No don't!

00:16:31.601 --> 00:16:33.100 position:10% line:89% align:start
No please, let me go, Nina!

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:35.567 position:27% line:89% align:start
Just stay calm.

00:16:35.601 --> 00:16:36.767 position:35% line:89% align:start
I promise.

00:16:36.801 --> 00:16:38.334 position:24% line:83% align:start
I'm gonna take you
somewhere safe!

00:16:45.300 --> 00:16:46.300 position:41% line:89% align:start
Elly!

00:16:48.634 --> 00:16:51.267 position:30% line:89% align:start
(Elly shrieks)

00:16:52.434 --> 00:16:54.434 position:33% line:89% align:start
Balgo Parks.

00:16:54.467 --> 00:16:56.300 position:30% line:89% align:start
Macy Baljure.

00:16:56.334 --> 00:16:59.434 position:7% line:83% align:start
You're seriously taking those
two and tryna run from me?

00:17:00.834 --> 00:17:02.100 position:30% line:89% align:start
Rickenbacker!

00:17:13.100 --> 00:17:14.501 position:24% line:89% align:start
Talk about naive.

00:17:15.634 --> 00:17:18.267 position:30% line:89% align:start
(Macy sobbing)

00:17:23.434 --> 00:17:24.601 position:33% line:89% align:start
Oh, come on.

00:17:24.634 --> 00:17:26.767 position:21% line:89% align:start
Stop crying already!

00:17:26.801 --> 00:17:29.033 position:16% line:89% align:start
But I left Elly behind.

00:17:30.300 --> 00:17:33.133 position:13% line:83% align:start
I told you, we can't take
the damn dragon with us!

00:17:33.167 --> 00:17:35.167 position:24% line:83% align:start
They're dangerous
to normal people!

00:17:36.367 --> 00:17:37.601 position:41% line:89% align:start
But...

00:17:37.634 --> 00:17:39.167 position:10% line:89% align:start
Would you stop your whining?

00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:41.634 position:10% line:83% align:start
Y'know, this is exactly what
I can't stand about you.

00:17:41.667 --> 00:17:43.501 position:24% line:89% align:start
Oh I knew it, Nina!

00:17:43.534 --> 00:17:44.634 position:24% line:89% align:start
It's my worst fear.

00:17:44.667 --> 00:17:46.801 position:5% line:89% align:start
You really do hate me after all!

00:17:46.834 --> 00:17:47.934 position:44% line:89% align:start
Ah!

00:17:47.968 --> 00:17:49.801 position:21% line:89% align:start
For crying out loud!

00:17:49.834 --> 00:17:52.000 position:7% line:89% align:start
Why are you so damn annoying?

00:17:54.267 --> 00:17:55.801 position:16% line:89% align:start
We should be safe here,

00:17:55.834 --> 00:17:58.167 position:21% line:83% align:start
at least for the
time being, that is.

00:17:58.200 --> 00:18:01.133 position:7% line:83% align:start
I've set up a Cloth, so they
shouldn't be able to find us.

00:18:03.934 --> 00:18:05.434 position:33% line:89% align:start
I gotta ask.

00:18:05.467 --> 00:18:06.667 position:21% line:89% align:start
What happened, Macy?

00:18:09.434 --> 00:18:11.167 position:27% line:89% align:start
Nothing really.

00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:14.801 position:5% line:83% align:start
You knew I never really enjoyed
being a member of the group.

00:18:14.834 --> 00:18:17.100 position:30% line:89% align:start
Yeah, I knew.

00:18:17.133 --> 00:18:20.067 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'm just tall, and they thought
I looked alright in makeup

00:18:20.100 --> 00:18:22.467 position:24% line:83% align:start
and happened to
be a good dancer.

00:18:22.501 --> 00:18:25.801 position:10% line:83% align:start
So they gave me cool
clothes and make up to wear,

00:18:25.834 --> 00:18:28.267 position:5% line:89% align:start
but I never actually felt cool.

00:18:28.300 --> 00:18:29.300 position:35% line:89% align:start
I get it.

00:18:29.334 --> 00:18:31.601 position:7% line:89% align:start
I figured that's why you quit.

00:18:31.634 --> 00:18:36.300 position:7% line:83% align:start
No, if that's all it was, I
would've quit a long time ago.

00:18:36.334 --> 00:18:39.934 position:16% line:83% align:start
But I couldn't quit
because you were there.

00:18:39.968 --> 00:18:43.133 position:13% line:83% align:start
And if I'd quit, I
would've become a nobody.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:45.000 position:41% line:89% align:start
But...

00:18:51.667 --> 00:18:55.000 position:19% line:83% align:start
Then two months ago I
found my little one.

00:18:55.801 --> 00:18:56.968 position:19% line:89% align:start
I don't mind the rain.

00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:58.000 position:35% line:89% align:start
Me either.

00:18:59.300 --> 00:19:01.133 position:5% line:89% align:start
She looked just like the dragons

00:19:01.167 --> 00:19:04.067 position:24% line:83% align:start
I'd seen in picture
books and cartoons.

00:19:04.100 --> 00:19:06.467 position:21% line:83% align:start
Apparently, no one
else could see her.

00:19:06.501 --> 00:19:09.667 position:10% line:83% align:start
So I thought I was imagining
things or losing my mind.

00:19:13.834 --> 00:19:16.300 position:19% line:83% align:start
But, then she started
drinking water,

00:19:16.334 --> 00:19:20.334 position:21% line:83% align:start
so I figured, yeah,
she must be real.

00:19:23.100 --> 00:19:26.300 position:21% line:83% align:start
I gave her some food,
and she ate that, too.

00:19:26.334 --> 00:19:28.100 position:13% line:89% align:start
I gave her lots of variety

00:19:28.133 --> 00:19:30.667 position:10% line:83% align:start
but she seemed to like
fruits and veggies the best.

00:19:31.801 --> 00:19:33.767 position:7% line:89% align:start
She didn't go to the bathroom,

00:19:33.801 --> 00:19:36.133 position:7% line:89% align:start
she just kept getting bigger.

00:19:36.167 --> 00:19:38.667 position:16% line:83% align:start
She started looking more
and more like a dragon.

00:19:42.601 --> 00:19:44.601 position:13% line:89% align:start
A dragon only I could see.

00:19:45.834 --> 00:19:48.100 position:21% line:83% align:start
I suddenly felt
like I was special.

00:19:50.167 --> 00:19:52.567 position:27% line:83% align:start
I know our songs
did really well.

00:19:52.601 --> 00:19:56.100 position:10% line:83% align:start
And you and the other girls
were amazing on stage.

00:19:56.133 --> 00:19:59.000 position:13% line:83% align:start
But I was the only one who
wasn't myself up there.

00:19:59.667 --> 00:20:02.000 position:24% line:89% align:start
(heavy breathing)

00:20:02.033 --> 00:20:05.033 position:16% line:83% align:start
I had fame, but outside
of that, I had nothing.

00:20:06.834 --> 00:20:10.634 position:7% line:83% align:start
Honestly, I'm not sure anyone
even noticed me up there.

00:20:14.334 --> 00:20:17.133 position:19% line:83% align:start
But, that all changed
when I found Elly.

00:20:18.701 --> 00:20:21.968 position:21% line:83% align:start
It felt like she gave
me some kind of power.

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:24.234 position:7% line:89% align:start
I felt like for the first time

00:20:24.267 --> 00:20:27.267 position:19% line:83% align:start
I had the potential
to be someone special.

00:20:29.334 --> 00:20:33.100 position:10% line:83% align:start
Then he, Bruno, appeared at
my place late last night.

00:20:37.267 --> 00:20:40.767 position:13% line:83% align:start
He told me he desperately
needed me and my dragon.

00:20:40.801 --> 00:20:42.801 position:13% line:89% align:start
My time had finally come!

00:20:42.834 --> 00:20:46.000 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'd be taken somewhere special,
and be something special.

00:20:46.934 --> 00:20:48.734 position:19% line:89% align:start
Nina, I have to say...

00:20:48.767 --> 00:20:51.467 position:38% line:89% align:start
(gasps)

00:20:51.501 --> 00:20:53.634 position:35% line:89% align:start
(grunts)

00:20:55.434 --> 00:20:56.434 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yo.

00:20:57.267 --> 00:20:59.501 position:7% line:89% align:start
You guys need an extra minute?

00:20:59.534 --> 00:21:01.167 position:19% line:89% align:start
To say your goodbyes?

00:21:04.534 --> 00:21:09.334 position:19% line:89% align:start
(closing theme music)
