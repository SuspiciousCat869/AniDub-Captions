00:00:06.801 --> 00:00:11.067 position:24% line:83% align:start
-(chimes tinkling)
-(logo popping)

00:00:12.767 --> 00:00:15.334 position:30% line:89% align:start
(bell chiming)

00:00:16.834 --> 00:00:20.167 position:16% line:89% align:start
(wind whooshing softly)

00:00:22.267 --> 00:00:23.067 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yo!

00:00:23.834 --> 00:00:26.133 position:7% line:89% align:start
You guys need an extra minute

00:00:26.167 --> 00:00:27.734 position:19% line:89% align:start
to say your goodbyes?

00:00:28.934 --> 00:00:30.501 position:24% line:89% align:start
(Bruno chuckling)

00:00:30.534 --> 00:00:31.334 position:27% line:89% align:start
(heavy thudding)

00:00:33.834 --> 00:00:36.801 position:16% line:5% align:start
(wind whooshing softly)

00:00:36.834 --> 00:00:40.033 position:21% line:5% align:start
Property damage,
aggravated assault,

00:00:40.067 --> 00:00:42.300 position:10% line:5% align:start
unlawful use of Witch Kits.

00:00:42.334 --> 00:00:45.000 position:13% line:83% align:start
I could pin a whole bunch
of other offenses on you,

00:00:46.133 --> 00:00:48.100 position:21% line:83% align:start
but we'll put all
that aside for now.

00:00:49.534 --> 00:00:50.901 position:19% line:89% align:start
I'll get to the point.

00:00:50.934 --> 00:00:52.400 position:21% line:83% align:start
-Check it out.
-(energy crackling)

00:00:52.434 --> 00:00:55.467 position:27% line:89% align:start
(energy buzzing)

00:00:55.501 --> 00:00:58.534 position:16% line:83% align:start
Balgo Parks has now been
officially designated

00:00:58.567 --> 00:00:59.901 position:24% line:89% align:start
a Punitive Dragon.

00:00:59.934 --> 00:01:02.300 position:19% line:83% align:start
If you need me to
spell it out for you,

00:01:02.334 --> 00:01:04.067 position:24% line:83% align:start
it means that from
this moment on

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:06.234 position:19% line:83% align:start
every witch and wizard
in Reverse London

00:01:06.267 --> 00:01:08.200 position:10% line:89% align:start
will be coming for his head!

00:01:08.234 --> 00:01:10.434 position:7% line:89% align:start
Huh? They're coming after me?

00:01:10.467 --> 00:01:11.467 position:33% line:89% align:start
Why though?

00:01:11.501 --> 00:01:13.434 position:16% line:83% align:start
I'm not really following
where this is going.

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.634 position:35% line:89% align:start
Seriously?

00:01:15.667 --> 00:01:18.200 position:16% line:83% align:start
You guys haven't filled
him in on anything yet?

00:01:18.234 --> 00:01:21.133 position:7% line:83% align:start
Then again, I guess not
telling a guy on borrowed time

00:01:21.167 --> 00:01:24.334 position:10% line:83% align:start
that he's about to die might
be the most merciful thing

00:01:24.367 --> 00:01:26.100 position:24% line:83% align:start
you could do for
the poor bastard!

00:01:27.434 --> 00:01:30.534 position:16% line:83% align:start
Wow, your words are as
terrifying as your face!

00:01:30.567 --> 00:01:31.534 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Osushi barking)

00:01:31.567 --> 00:01:33.234 position:21% line:83% align:start
Hey, Ninny, I'm
going to shoot Spark

00:01:33.267 --> 00:01:34.667 position:19% line:89% align:start
on the count of three.

00:01:34.701 --> 00:01:35.901 position:13% line:89% align:start
Let's divide and conquer.

00:01:35.934 --> 00:01:37.133 position:41% line:89% align:start
Okay.

00:01:37.167 --> 00:01:39.968 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Noel] Would you rather
take Balgo or Macy?

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.400 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Ninny] Do you even need to ask?

00:01:42.434 --> 00:01:43.534 position:24% line:89% align:start
(glass shattering)

00:01:43.567 --> 00:01:44.634 position:27% line:89% align:start
(air whooshing)

00:01:44.667 --> 00:01:46.734 position:13% line:83% align:start
I don't know what you're
chatting about over there,

00:01:46.767 --> 00:01:49.434 position:10% line:83% align:start
but since everyone in Reverse
London is gonna be hunting him

00:01:49.467 --> 00:01:51.634 position:19% line:83% align:start
where the hell do you
think you can hide?

00:01:51.667 --> 00:01:54.434 position:13% line:89% align:start
Uh, excuse me, uh, Bruno?

00:01:54.467 --> 00:01:55.801 position:21% line:89% align:start
(footsteps thudding)

00:01:55.834 --> 00:01:57.567 position:21% line:83% align:start
-(Macy gasping)
-(suspenseful music)

00:01:57.601 --> 00:01:59.133 position:24% line:89% align:start
I just heard Elly.

00:01:59.167 --> 00:02:00.501 position:19% line:89% align:start
She's getting closer!

00:02:00.534 --> 00:02:02.367 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Elly shrieking)

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:03.567 position:27% line:89% align:start
(air whooshing)

00:02:03.601 --> 00:02:06.634 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Elly shrieking)

00:02:06.667 --> 00:02:07.634 position:41% line:89% align:start
Elly!

00:02:07.667 --> 00:02:09.200 position:13% line:89% align:start
(all except Bruno gasping)

00:02:09.234 --> 00:02:10.801 position:16% line:89% align:start
So you followed us, huh?

00:02:10.834 --> 00:02:13.968 position:21% line:89% align:start
(footsteps thudding)

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.200 position:24% line:89% align:start
(glass shattering)

00:02:15.234 --> 00:02:18.133 position:21% line:83% align:start
That's too bad,
considering the fact

00:02:18.167 --> 00:02:19.567 position:13% line:89% align:start
I don't need you anymore!

00:02:19.601 --> 00:02:23.234 position:19% line:83% align:start
-(energy whooshing)
-(footsteps thudding)

00:02:23.267 --> 00:02:24.033 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:02:24.067 --> 00:02:25.300 position:27% line:89% align:start
She disappeared?

00:02:25.334 --> 00:02:26.567 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:02:26.601 --> 00:02:29.367 position:19% line:83% align:start
Come to think of it,
when I first saw her,

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.234 position:19% line:83% align:start
I remember it looking
like she suddenly

00:02:31.267 --> 00:02:33.067 position:24% line:83% align:start
just appeared out
of the darkness,

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:36.734 position:21% line:83% align:start
but, no, she was
actually invisible!

00:02:36.767 --> 00:02:38.234 position:5% line:89% align:start
I don't have time for this shit!

00:02:38.267 --> 00:02:40.234 position:21% line:83% align:start
Did she use Stealth
Scale just now?

00:02:40.267 --> 00:02:42.801 position:5% line:83% align:start
That's not something any
run-of-the-mill dragon can use!

00:02:42.834 --> 00:02:45.400 position:27% line:89% align:start
(air whooshing)

00:02:45.434 --> 00:02:47.033 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Bruno gasping)

00:02:47.067 --> 00:02:49.734 position:27% line:89% align:start
(blow crashing)

00:02:51.834 --> 00:02:55.133 position:16% line:89% align:start
(Rickenbacker crashing)

00:02:55.167 --> 00:03:00.167 position:24% line:83% align:start
-(wings flapping)
-(mystical music)

00:03:12.434 --> 00:03:17.434 position:24% line:83% align:start
-(wings flapping)
-(body crackling)

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.667 position:27% line:89% align:start
(air whooshing)

00:03:24.767 --> 00:03:27.334 position:30% line:89% align:start
(both gasping)

00:03:28.734 --> 00:03:29.734 position:41% line:89% align:start
Elly?

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.667 position:27% line:89% align:start
(air whooshing)

00:03:34.501 --> 00:03:37.267 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Elly thudding)

00:03:48.601 --> 00:03:49.767 position:19% line:89% align:start
[Ninny] What the heck?

00:03:49.801 --> 00:03:52.033 position:24% line:83% align:start
Her size and shape
totally changed!

00:03:53.667 --> 00:03:56.133 position:16% line:83% align:start
It appears she must have
molted in the moonlight.

00:03:56.167 --> 00:03:58.667 position:16% line:83% align:start
Wait, hold on, but that
would mean she's a-

00:03:58.701 --> 00:03:59.467 position:19% line:89% align:start
[Bruno] Yeah, exactly.

00:03:59.501 --> 00:04:00.467 position:27% line:83% align:start
-Hm?
-(Noel grunting)

00:04:00.501 --> 00:04:02.234 position:30% line:89% align:start
(tense music)

00:04:02.267 --> 00:04:05.234 position:13% line:83% align:start
Molting in the moonlight,
using Stealth Scale,

00:04:05.267 --> 00:04:08.167 position:21% line:83% align:start
not to mention she's
got six talons.

00:04:09.067 --> 00:04:10.734 position:5% line:89% align:start
Yeah, there's no doubt about it,

00:04:10.767 --> 00:04:14.100 position:10% line:89% align:start
that one there is a Marchen.

00:04:16.367 --> 00:04:17.434 position:33% line:89% align:start
Whoa, crazy!

00:04:17.467 --> 00:04:18.868 position:24% line:89% align:start
What's a Marchen?

00:04:18.901 --> 00:04:21.000 position:21% line:83% align:start
A Marchen is one of
the seven dragons

00:04:21.033 --> 00:04:23.133 position:16% line:83% align:start
named after fairy tales,
tales that have been

00:04:23.167 --> 00:04:26.467 position:19% line:83% align:start
around Reverse London
since it was founded.

00:04:26.501 --> 00:04:28.267 position:33% line:89% align:start
Snow White,

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:29.701 position:35% line:89% align:start
Red Dress,

00:04:29.734 --> 00:04:31.467 position:33% line:89% align:start
Golden Axe,

00:04:31.501 --> 00:04:32.701 position:35% line:89% align:start
Bubbles,

00:04:32.734 --> 00:04:34.501 position:33% line:89% align:start
Sugar House,

00:04:34.534 --> 00:04:36.501 position:21% line:89% align:start
Band of Animals, and

00:04:38.601 --> 00:04:40.801 position:13% line:83% align:start
the one that only becomes
a full-fledged dragon

00:04:40.834 --> 00:04:42.267 position:10% line:89% align:start
by molting in the moonlight:

00:04:43.434 --> 00:04:44.601 position:33% line:89% align:start
Cinderella.

00:04:44.634 --> 00:04:45.467 position:16% line:89% align:start
(gentle dramatic music)

00:04:45.501 --> 00:04:46.501 position:33% line:89% align:start
Cinderella?

00:04:48.968 --> 00:04:50.901 position:13% line:83% align:start
That name was given
because, like Cinderella,

00:04:50.934 --> 00:04:53.934 position:21% line:83% align:start
this Marchen
transforms at night,

00:04:53.968 --> 00:04:56.234 position:16% line:83% align:start
and because it scatters
a dust called Star Ash

00:04:56.267 --> 00:04:57.501 position:19% line:89% align:start
when it gets agitated.

00:04:58.400 --> 00:04:59.567 position:27% line:89% align:start
(air whooshing)

00:04:59.601 --> 00:05:01.734 position:10% line:89% align:start
Everything the dust touches

00:05:01.767 --> 00:05:04.234 position:27% line:89% align:start
(wings flapping)

00:05:04.267 --> 00:05:09.267 position:7% line:83% align:start
-(explosions booming)
-(singing in foreign language)

00:05:10.501 --> 00:05:12.534 position:21% line:83% align:start
becomes enveloped in
light, or at least

00:05:12.567 --> 00:05:15.033 position:7% line:83% align:start
that's what all the
encyclopedias say about them.

00:05:15.067 --> 00:05:16.968 position:19% line:83% align:start
Why are you being all
poetic about light?

00:05:17.033 --> 00:05:18.267 position:19% line:89% align:start
They're clearly bombs!

00:05:19.934 --> 00:05:21.300 position:27% line:83% align:start
-Balgo Parks!
-(Macy yelping)

00:05:21.334 --> 00:05:22.334 position:35% line:89% align:start
Uh, yeah?

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:26.400 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'll hold off on
killing you for now.

00:05:26.434 --> 00:05:30.334 position:19% line:83% align:start
The Marchens, the Dark
Dragons' ancestors,

00:05:30.367 --> 00:05:34.067 position:7% line:83% align:start
these bad boys are permanently
authorized for elimination,

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:36.334 position:21% line:83% align:start
designated as
enemies of mankind.

00:05:37.334 --> 00:05:39.501 position:19% line:83% align:start
Never thought I'd see
one with my own eyes.

00:05:40.734 --> 00:05:42.267 position:19% line:89% align:start
This is gonna be fun!

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:44.367 position:35% line:89% align:start
Hang on!

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:46.067 position:24% line:83% align:start
Are you planning on
fighting that thing?

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:48.734 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Bruno] Don't be stupid,
I'm not gonna fight it!

00:05:48.767 --> 00:05:51.033 position:21% line:83% align:start
-Huh?
-I'm gonna kill it.

00:05:51.067 --> 00:05:53.734 position:16% line:83% align:start
No better way to make a
name for myself, right?

00:05:53.767 --> 00:05:55.267 position:5% line:89% align:start
Don't get in my way, you brats.

00:05:56.601 --> 00:05:57.734 position:30% line:89% align:start
Rickenbacker?

00:05:57.767 --> 00:05:59.501 position:27% line:89% align:start
You up for this?

00:05:59.534 --> 00:06:00.734 position:16% line:89% align:start
(Rickenbacker grunting)

00:06:00.767 --> 00:06:01.767 position:30% line:89% align:start
That's my boy.

00:06:04.667 --> 00:06:05.634 position:30% line:89% align:start
Let's do this!

00:06:05.667 --> 00:06:08.367 position:27% line:89% align:start
(air whooshing)

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:09.801 position:7% line:89% align:start
He seriously went over there.

00:06:09.834 --> 00:06:11.133 position:21% line:89% align:start
I can't believe him!

00:06:11.167 --> 00:06:14.234 position:21% line:83% align:start
Niiha, let's go for
a frontal attack.

00:06:14.267 --> 00:06:15.801 position:13% line:89% align:start
We'll call HQ for back-up!

00:06:15.834 --> 00:06:16.801 position:44% line:89% align:start
No.

00:06:16.834 --> 00:06:18.534 position:41% line:89% align:start
What?

-If we request reinforcements,
-(Macy gasping)

00:06:26.601 --> 00:06:28.067 position:19% line:89% align:start
Balgo will be killed.

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:30.901 position:19% line:83% align:start
Well, well, maybe,
but it's an emergency,

00:06:30.934 --> 00:06:32.033 position:24% line:89% align:start
so they might not-

What the actual hell?

00:06:40.734 --> 00:06:42.300 position:5% line:89% align:start
Are those Star Ash things alive?

00:06:42.334 --> 00:06:44.033 position:27% line:83% align:start
-I have no idea!
-(Balgo yelping)

What happened to the other two?

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.067 position:24% line:83% align:start
Did you leave 'em
somewhere safe?

00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:50.467 position:16% line:83% align:start
Depends, where would you
consider safe right now?

00:07:50.501 --> 00:07:52.467 position:24% line:83% align:start
We just left them
both over there.

00:07:52.501 --> 00:07:55.033 position:13% line:83% align:start
Honestly, anywhere is
safer than being up here.

00:07:55.767 --> 00:07:57.100 position:16% line:89% align:start
Yeah, you're tellin' me.

We can kill Cinderella if we
break those crown-like horns.

Are you sure that's true and
not just from the legend?

We're fighting a

What else do we have to go on?

00:08:16.267 --> 00:08:18.767 position:19% line:83% align:start
If I can nail that
thing with your help,

00:08:18.801 --> 00:08:21.100 position:7% line:89% align:start
your reps will skyrocket too.

00:08:21.133 --> 00:08:24.501 position:10% line:83% align:start
After that, I might consider
getting you into the Inks.

00:08:24.534 --> 00:08:26.033 position:16% line:89% align:start
Except I'm pretty sure-

00:08:26.067 --> 00:08:27.934 position:7% line:89% align:start

[Ninny] Niiha,
we'll circle around

00:08:40.701 --> 00:08:42.400 position:16% line:89% align:start

00:12:22.434 --> 00:12:24.767 position:21% line:83% align:start
How long are you
gonna keep this up?

00:12:25.801 --> 00:12:27.133 position:7% line:89% align:start
You're still lying to yourself

00:12:27.167 --> 00:12:29.100 position:24% line:83% align:start
thinking she'll
give you strength?

00:12:29.133 --> 00:12:32.467 position:5% line:83% align:start
Or that she'll sweep you up
and take you somewhere special?

00:12:32.501 --> 00:12:36.334 position:19% line:83% align:start
This is real life,
not a damn fairy tale.

00:12:36.367 --> 00:12:37.167 position:33% line:89% align:start
[Macy] Nina.

00:12:38.267 --> 00:12:40.133 position:7% line:89% align:start
Fairy tales are such bullshit.

00:12:40.167 --> 00:12:42.901 position:24% line:89% align:start
(book shattering)

00:12:42.934 --> 00:12:44.734 position:19% line:83% align:start
What's the point
when the spell breaks

00:12:44.767 --> 00:12:46.234 position:16% line:89% align:start
in the middle of it all?

00:12:46.267 --> 00:12:48.868 position:13% line:83% align:start
It was inevitable because
you broke your promise?

00:12:48.901 --> 00:12:51.467 position:21% line:83% align:start
Or time ran out,
so what can you do?

00:12:51.501 --> 00:12:52.901 position:24% line:89% align:start
Inevitable, my ass!

00:12:52.934 --> 00:12:54.334 position:24% line:89% align:start
It's all so stupid!

00:12:56.767 --> 00:13:00.200 position:13% line:83% align:start
Because neither you or
anyone else have any idea

00:13:00.234 --> 00:13:02.767 position:10% line:89% align:start
why the spell really breaks.

00:13:02.801 --> 00:13:04.767 position:24% line:83% align:start
The reason that it
breaks so randomly

00:13:06.234 --> 00:13:08.334 position:19% line:83% align:start
is because it was
never your own doing.

00:13:09.767 --> 00:13:13.167 position:10% line:83% align:start
Macy, we're supposed to be
the ones casting the spells.

00:13:15.834 --> 00:13:17.734 position:19% line:89% align:start
(Cinderella shrieking)

00:13:17.767 --> 00:13:19.501 position:30% line:89% align:start
(all yelping)

00:13:19.534 --> 00:13:20.868 position:19% line:89% align:start
Ninny, here it comes!

00:13:20.901 --> 00:13:23.801 position:10% line:89% align:start
Okay, let's do this already!

00:13:23.834 --> 00:13:26.133 position:13% line:89% align:start
Noel, can I help you out?

00:13:26.767 --> 00:13:27.934 position:19% line:89% align:start
[Noel] Absolutely not.

00:13:27.968 --> 00:13:29.901 position:21% line:83% align:start
Just hold on to that
pipe we gave you

00:13:29.934 --> 00:13:31.634 position:24% line:83% align:start
and go cower in
the corner please.

00:13:31.667 --> 00:13:33.400 position:21% line:89% align:start
Okay, that one hurt!

00:13:33.434 --> 00:13:34.400 position:24% line:83% align:start
-(kick thudding)
-(Ninny grunting)

00:13:34.434 --> 00:13:35.767 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Balgo groaning)

00:13:35.801 --> 00:13:37.734 position:7% line:89% align:start
If you got it, then get going!

00:13:37.767 --> 00:13:39.868 position:24% line:83% align:start
Don't you dare let
Osushi get hurt!

00:13:39.901 --> 00:13:41.634 position:27% line:89% align:start
Okay, I get it!

00:13:41.667 --> 00:13:44.634 position:13% line:83% align:start
Well, I guess we're both
staying put then, Osushi.

00:13:44.667 --> 00:13:47.267 position:27% line:89% align:start
(energy booming)

00:13:50.934 --> 00:13:52.100 position:33% line:89% align:start
[Ninny] Huh?

00:13:54.901 --> 00:13:56.167 position:24% line:89% align:start
What's this thing?

00:13:56.200 --> 00:13:57.934 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Ninny And Noel] We'd like
to know that ourselves!

00:13:57.968 --> 00:14:00.067 position:16% line:83% align:start
No, seriously, the
hell's with that sword?

00:14:00.100 --> 00:14:02.434 position:19% line:83% align:start
Did that come from
the pipe we gave you?

00:14:02.467 --> 00:14:03.701 position:24% line:89% align:start
How could that be?

00:14:03.734 --> 00:14:05.067 position:27% line:89% align:start
(air whooshing)

00:14:05.100 --> 00:14:06.467 position:10% line:89% align:start
There she is, Rickenbacker!

00:14:06.501 --> 00:14:08.667 position:24% line:89% align:start
(grim tense music)

00:14:08.701 --> 00:14:10.234 position:16% line:89% align:start
(Cinderella chittering)

00:14:10.267 --> 00:14:11.634 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hm?

00:14:11.667 --> 00:14:12.734 position:27% line:89% align:start
Something's off.

00:14:12.767 --> 00:14:14.200 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Ninny] Hey, how'd you do that?

00:14:14.234 --> 00:14:15.601 position:27% line:83% align:start
-I have no idea!
-(Noel gasping)

00:14:15.634 --> 00:14:16.634 position:27% line:83% align:start
-Let me see!
-(Balgo yelping)

00:14:16.667 --> 00:14:19.734 position:30% line:89% align:start
(tense music)

00:14:19.767 --> 00:14:21.434 position:13% line:89% align:start
Cinderella stopped moving.

00:14:21.467 --> 00:14:22.434 position:24% line:89% align:start
What does she see?

00:14:22.467 --> 00:14:24.801 position:24% line:89% align:start
(energy whooshing)

00:14:24.834 --> 00:14:27.767 position:24% line:89% align:start
(crown shattering)

00:14:33.467 --> 00:14:36.133 position:27% line:89% align:start
(air whooshing)

00:14:38.601 --> 00:14:40.734 position:24% line:89% align:start
(energy sizzling)

00:14:40.767 --> 00:14:41.767 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hoo!

00:14:42.734 --> 00:14:44.834 position:19% line:89% align:start
Well, all right then!

00:14:44.868 --> 00:14:46.567 position:24% line:83% align:start
That'll be enough
of that, thanks.

00:14:46.601 --> 00:14:48.334 position:30% line:89% align:start
(ash fizzling)

00:14:48.367 --> 00:14:51.133 position:27% line:89% align:start
(bells clanging)

00:15:00.901 --> 00:15:02.100 position:41% line:89% align:start
What?

00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:06.200 position:10% line:83% align:start
How did we get zero earnings
after a feat like that?

00:15:06.234 --> 00:15:08.601 position:13% line:89% align:start
It's not technically zero.

00:15:08.634 --> 00:15:09.734 position:19% line:89% align:start
See? It's right here!

00:15:10.801 --> 00:15:12.300 position:5% line:89% align:start
I think we both know five points

00:15:12.334 --> 00:15:14.801 position:19% line:83% align:start
and five scale pounds
is basically zero.

00:15:14.834 --> 00:15:17.801 position:7% line:83% align:start
We took down a legendary
dragon and that's all we get?

00:15:17.834 --> 00:15:19.934 position:16% line:89% align:start
I don't think so, buddy!

00:15:19.968 --> 00:15:21.868 position:19% line:83% align:start
It's a miracle you're
not in the negative

00:15:21.901 --> 00:15:23.234 position:10% line:89% align:start
after all that destruction.

00:15:23.267 --> 00:15:24.601 position:13% line:89% align:start
Honestly, it's impressive!

00:15:26.133 --> 00:15:29.868 position:7% line:83% align:start
And, anyway, Director
Bangnyfe dealt the final blow,

00:15:29.901 --> 00:15:31.567 position:10% line:89% align:start
or that's what it says here.

00:15:31.601 --> 00:15:33.133 position:24% line:89% align:start
Huh? What the hell?

00:15:33.167 --> 00:15:36.300 position:7% line:83% align:start
That dumb paper's lying
'cause he didn't do it either!

00:15:36.334 --> 00:15:38.067 position:13% line:89% align:start
If he didn't do it either,

00:15:38.100 --> 00:15:40.968 position:19% line:83% align:start
then you two also
didn't do it, correct?

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:42.133 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Ninny growling)

00:15:42.167 --> 00:15:44.100 position:19% line:89% align:start
So there you have it!

00:15:44.133 --> 00:15:47.434 position:5% line:83% align:start
Patchworks is collecting and
preserving Cinderella's corpse.

00:15:47.467 --> 00:15:49.400 position:30% line:89% align:start
And, oh, yeah!

00:15:49.434 --> 00:15:50.400 position:33% line:89% align:start
Come on in!

00:15:50.434 --> 00:15:51.634 position:27% line:89% align:start
(door clicking)

00:15:51.667 --> 00:15:53.367 position:7% line:89% align:start
(both grunting questioningly)

00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:54.901 position:24% line:83% align:start
-(chimes ringing)
-(gentle music)

00:15:54.934 --> 00:15:56.334 position:27% line:83% align:start
-Macy?
-(Macy giggling)

00:15:56.367 --> 00:15:57.701 position:30% line:89% align:start
What the hell?

00:15:57.734 --> 00:16:00.901 position:10% line:83% align:start
You better not be telling me
we're taking in another one!

00:16:00.934 --> 00:16:03.234 position:10% line:89% align:start
Wow, you're a sharp cookie!

00:16:03.267 --> 00:16:05.133 position:27% line:83% align:start
-(Ninny gasping)
-You nailed it!

00:16:05.167 --> 00:16:06.734 position:21% line:83% align:start
Through this ordeal
we determined

00:16:06.767 --> 00:16:09.167 position:24% line:83% align:start
she's a light case
of Dragonclad,

00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:12.133 position:7% line:83% align:start
so we decided it was our duty
to take her in (chuckling).

00:16:13.634 --> 00:16:15.067 position:10% line:89% align:start
Doesn't that sound like fun?

00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:17.734 position:16% line:83% align:start
Not really, and no one
asked for your opinion!

00:16:17.767 --> 00:16:19.834 position:27% line:83% align:start
-(Macy giggling)
-(Ninny yelping)

00:16:19.868 --> 00:16:20.901 position:24% line:83% align:start
-(Macy humming)
-(Ninny grunting)

00:16:20.934 --> 00:16:22.133 position:27% line:89% align:start
I'm so excited!

00:16:22.167 --> 00:16:24.367 position:24% line:83% align:start
We're gonna have
so much fun, Nina!

00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:25.400 position:35% line:89% align:start
Excuse me?

00:16:26.501 --> 00:16:28.434 position:19% line:83% align:start
Do we know what's
happening with Balgo?

00:16:29.767 --> 00:16:31.567 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Banx Jr.] Oh,
right, about that.

00:16:32.767 --> 00:16:34.701 position:5% line:89% align:start
A motion to release Balgo Parks

00:16:34.734 --> 00:16:37.133 position:5% line:89% align:start
from his Punitive Dragon status?

00:16:38.167 --> 00:16:40.334 position:19% line:83% align:start
You're the last person
I expected this from.

00:16:41.634 --> 00:16:44.067 position:5% line:89% align:start
However, from our investigation,

00:16:45.167 --> 00:16:47.100 position:5% line:89% align:start
it would appear that Balgo Parks

00:16:47.133 --> 00:16:50.467 position:13% line:83% align:start
had an encounter with Macy
Baljure two months ago,

00:16:50.501 --> 00:16:52.400 position:19% line:83% align:start
and if that exact
moment was the trigger

00:16:52.434 --> 00:16:55.067 position:19% line:83% align:start
that caused Cinderella
to manifest,

00:16:55.100 --> 00:16:57.234 position:19% line:83% align:start
then that certainly
changes our approach,

00:16:57.267 --> 00:17:00.000 position:13% line:83% align:start
and it's more than enough
reason to keep him alive.

00:17:01.100 --> 00:17:03.934 position:5% line:89% align:start
Because he's going to be the key

00:17:03.968 --> 00:17:06.400 position:21% line:83% align:start
to exterminating
all of the Marchens.

00:17:06.434 --> 00:17:08.567 position:27% line:89% align:start
(pensive music)

00:17:08.601 --> 00:17:10.400 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Bruno grunting)

00:17:10.434 --> 00:17:12.567 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Student 1] Did you read the
Cinderella damage report?

00:17:12.601 --> 00:17:13.801 position:19% line:89% align:start
[Student 2] Sure did.

00:17:13.834 --> 00:17:15.067 position:7% line:89% align:start
It's absolutely off the wall!

00:17:15.100 --> 00:17:16.634 position:16% line:89% align:start
(gasping) Good morning!

00:17:16.667 --> 00:17:17.901 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hm?

00:17:17.934 --> 00:17:20.133 position:24% line:83% align:start
Yes, good morning,
Director Squire!

00:17:21.634 --> 00:17:23.367 position:13% line:89% align:start
[Sullivan] I have to ask,

00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:26.767 position:16% line:83% align:start
when did this area
become a storage space?

00:17:26.801 --> 00:17:29.067 position:5% line:89% align:start
(yelping) We're terribly sorry!

00:17:29.100 --> 00:17:30.467 position:10% line:89% align:start
We'll move them immediately!

00:17:30.501 --> 00:17:31.467 position:24% line:89% align:start
Come on, hurry up!

00:17:31.501 --> 00:17:33.734 position:24% line:89% align:start
[Student 2] Okay!

00:17:33.767 --> 00:17:34.734 position:24% line:89% align:start

00:17:45.767 --> 00:17:47.701 position:30% line:89% align:start
Chief Banx Jr.

00:17:47.734 --> 00:17:51.567 position:10% line:83% align:start
Well, I must say I'm glad I
wasn't mistaken about you,

00:17:51.601 --> 00:17:52.767 position:24% line:89% align:start
you son of a hero.

00:17:54.934 --> 00:17:56.634 position:21% line:83% align:start
-Whee!
-(Osushi squeaking)

00:17:56.667 --> 00:17:58.133 position:38% line:89% align:start
Osushi!

00:17:58.167 --> 00:17:59.400 position:16% line:89% align:start
You're as cute as ever!

00:17:59.434 --> 00:18:00.834 position:24% line:83% align:start
-Yes, you are!
-(Osushi grunting)

00:18:00.868 --> 00:18:03.033 position:24% line:83% align:start
You're so adorable,
you're set for life!

00:18:03.667 --> 00:18:04.634 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Balgo gasping)

00:18:04.667 --> 00:18:05.767 position:24% line:89% align:start
Welcome back, Noel!

00:18:06.934 --> 00:18:08.801 position:21% line:83% align:start
The chief just came
by and took back

00:18:08.834 --> 00:18:11.000 position:27% line:83% align:start
that super sweet
mantle and pipe.
