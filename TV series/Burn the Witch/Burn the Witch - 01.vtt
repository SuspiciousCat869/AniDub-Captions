00:00:06.534 --> 00:00:09.501 position:19% line:89% align:start
(jingle bells ringing)

00:00:19.934 --> 00:00:20.901 position:30% line:89% align:start
(camera click)

00:00:20.934 --> 00:00:23.133 position:7% line:89% align:start
Fairytales are such bullshit.

00:00:23.834 --> 00:00:25.901 position:33% line:89% align:start
(footsteps)

00:00:25.934 --> 00:00:28.300 position:5% line:83% align:start
(door opening)
A girl gets a spell cast on her

00:00:28.334 --> 00:00:30.133 position:5% line:89% align:start
that turns her into a princess.

00:00:30.167 --> 00:00:32.067 position:5% line:89% align:start
She gets to wear a pretty dress,

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:35.300 position:16% line:83% align:start
pretends to choose a
hot guy, who chose her.

00:00:35.334 --> 00:00:38.400 position:7% line:83% align:start
Then the spell randomly breaks
in the middle of it all.

00:00:38.434 --> 00:00:40.167 position:33% line:89% align:start
Lame, right?

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.133 position:13% line:83% align:start
Yet, for some reason, every
girl wants to be a princess.

00:00:43.167 --> 00:00:44.767 position:19% line:89% align:start
Like, are you serious?

00:00:44.801 --> 00:00:47.067 position:5% line:89% align:start
The spell just breaks randomly?

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.934 position:16% line:83% align:start
Was it inevitable 'cause
you broke your promise,

00:00:49.968 --> 00:00:52.133 position:21% line:83% align:start
or time ran out?
So what can you do?

00:00:52.167 --> 00:00:54.100 position:13% line:89% align:start
But you can do something.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.467 position:10% line:89% align:start
Honestly, you're all idiots.

00:00:57.501 --> 00:00:59.400 position:21% line:83% align:start
Not one of you knows
the real reason

00:00:59.434 --> 00:01:01.167 position:24% line:83% align:start
the spell always
ends up breaking.

00:01:02.567 --> 00:01:03.801 position:33% line:89% align:start
So annoying.

00:01:03.834 --> 00:01:05.033 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Huh?
-Huh?

00:01:07.534 --> 00:01:08.300 position:19% line:89% align:start
(loud sparkling flash)

00:01:08.334 --> 00:01:10.968 position:35% line:89% align:start
(men gasp)

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.467 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Man] Hey wait,
Ninny, come back!

00:01:12.501 --> 00:01:14.901 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Man] What the hell
was that insane flash?

00:01:14.934 --> 00:01:18.334 position:16% line:89% align:start
(sweeping, upbeat music)

00:01:21.934 --> 00:01:25.100 position:19% line:89% align:start
(electronic twitches)

00:01:27.501 --> 00:01:29.033 position:16% line:89% align:start
[Man] She went in there.

00:01:29.067 --> 00:01:31.167 position:35% line:89% align:start
(gasping)

00:01:34.234 --> 00:01:36.067 position:19% line:89% align:start
[Man] She disappeared.

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:38.434 position:7% line:89% align:start
If magic only works on fools,

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.067 position:10% line:83% align:start
then better off being the
one who's casting the spell.

00:01:46.601 --> 00:01:48.567 position:27% line:89% align:start
(ground shakes)

00:01:48.601 --> 00:01:50.067 position:24% line:89% align:start
(heavy footsteps)

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.968 position:19% line:83% align:start
The tip of my finger,
the edge of my voice.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.300 position:21% line:83% align:start
Revenger Joe's iron
key, five locks,

00:01:56.334 --> 00:01:58.234 position:5% line:89% align:start
three chains, silence sheathed,

00:01:58.267 --> 00:02:00.501 position:24% line:83% align:start
and a blast from
the pipe to blind.

00:02:00.534 --> 00:02:02.901 position:33% line:89% align:start
(loud horn)

00:02:02.934 --> 00:02:04.534 position:35% line:89% align:start
(screech)

00:02:04.567 --> 00:02:07.767 position:16% line:89% align:start
(electricity twitching)

00:02:07.801 --> 00:02:10.133 position:21% line:83% align:start
No, hold on, please
don't use magic.

00:02:10.167 --> 00:02:13.033 position:19% line:83% align:start
Your magic, it'll make
your antlers bloom.

00:02:16.601 --> 00:02:17.868 position:30% line:89% align:start
(loud screech)

00:02:17.901 --> 00:02:19.100 position:33% line:89% align:start
Blue spark.

00:02:21.367 --> 00:02:23.534 position:27% line:89% align:start
(ground shakes)

00:02:23.567 --> 00:02:25.767 position:35% line:89% align:start
(grunting)

00:02:28.767 --> 00:02:31.567 position:7% line:89% align:start
Magic number 44, flash bumper.

00:02:32.601 --> 00:02:35.400 position:24% line:89% align:start
(uplifting music)

00:02:35.434 --> 00:02:37.067 position:33% line:89% align:start
(loud crash)

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:38.534 position:27% line:89% align:start
That was close.

00:02:38.567 --> 00:02:40.167 position:16% line:89% align:start
Jeez, that's a bud buck.

00:02:41.501 --> 00:02:42.734 position:16% line:89% align:start
It's an A rank harvest.

00:02:42.767 --> 00:02:45.667 position:13% line:83% align:start
What were you going to do
if I didn't it in time?

00:02:46.901 --> 00:02:49.133 position:27% line:83% align:start
Oh, just spare me
the lecture, okay.

00:02:49.167 --> 00:02:52.434 position:13% line:83% align:start
Especially since you
showed up so late. Ninny.

00:02:54.501 --> 00:02:56.601 position:21% line:83% align:start
And stop calling me
by my first name.

00:02:56.634 --> 00:02:59.067 position:7% line:89% align:start
I have seniority here. Niiha.

00:03:01.267 --> 00:03:03.200 position:21% line:83% align:start
If you start calling
me Noel then sure,

00:03:03.234 --> 00:03:05.234 position:33% line:83% align:start
maybe I might
consider it, Ninny.

00:03:05.267 --> 00:03:07.634 position:10% line:83% align:start
I'm sorry, where do you get
off casually making demands

00:03:07.667 --> 00:03:09.234 position:10% line:89% align:start
of your superiors like that?

00:03:10.901 --> 00:03:14.534 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Narrator] Dragons,
mythical creatures.

00:03:14.567 --> 00:03:19.434 position:7% line:83% align:start
But in truth, they are neither
mythical nor creatures.

00:03:19.467 --> 00:03:22.634 position:19% line:83% align:start
Despite what the public
has been led to believe,

00:03:22.667 --> 00:03:26.801 position:16% line:83% align:start
since time and memorial,
72% of deaths in London

00:03:26.834 --> 00:03:31.300 position:7% line:83% align:start
have been caused by grotesque
beings, known as dragons.

00:03:31.334 --> 00:03:33.067 position:10% line:89% align:start
That is the reason why they

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:37.167 position:10% line:83% align:start
are so prominently displayed
on London's coat of arms.

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:40.334 position:16% line:83% align:start
Rampaging dragons cause
great harm to humans.

00:03:41.567 --> 00:03:42.968 position:13% line:89% align:start
In order to prevent this,

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.033 position:16% line:83% align:start
the dragons must be
monitored at all times.

00:03:46.067 --> 00:03:48.567 position:16% line:83% align:start
Unfortunately the
citizens of front London

00:03:48.601 --> 00:03:51.367 position:19% line:83% align:start
cannot see the dragons
with their naked eyes,

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:55.400 position:7% line:83% align:start
but fortunately for them,
there's also a reverse London.

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:00.067 position:13% line:83% align:start
Only those residing on
the reverse side of London

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:02.067 position:21% line:89% align:start
can see the dragons.

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:04.634 position:27% line:83% align:start
Therefore due to
the special ability

00:04:04.667 --> 00:04:07.901 position:13% line:83% align:start
it inevitably fell to the
people of reverse London

00:04:07.934 --> 00:04:11.734 position:24% line:83% align:start
to take care of and
manage the dragons.

00:04:11.767 --> 00:04:13.901 position:7% line:89% align:start
What the heck are you kidding?

00:04:13.934 --> 00:04:15.367 position:30% line:83% align:start
You guys still
haven't fixed this

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:17.067 position:7% line:89% align:start
since that big guy wrecked it.

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:18.467 position:27% line:89% align:start
You had one job.

00:04:18.501 --> 00:04:20.167 position:24% line:89% align:start
Hi. I'm so sorry.

00:04:21.501 --> 00:04:24.033 position:19% line:83% align:start
We were ordered to get
the monitor up first

00:04:24.801 --> 00:04:26.534 position:27% line:83% align:start
[Ninny] And you,
why did you take

00:04:26.567 --> 00:04:28.901 position:21% line:83% align:start
on a two person job
all by yourself?

00:04:28.934 --> 00:04:30.767 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Noel] Maybe because
you were late, Ninny.

00:04:30.801 --> 00:04:32.167 position:7% line:89% align:start
[Ninny] Ever heard of waiting?

00:04:33.067 --> 00:04:34.934 position:35% line:89% align:start
(dinging)

00:04:34.968 --> 00:04:37.133 position:24% line:83% align:start
And if I took care
of it on my own,

00:04:37.167 --> 00:04:39.300 position:24% line:83% align:start
I'd get the reward
all to myself.

00:04:39.334 --> 00:04:40.300 position:35% line:89% align:start
I knew it.

00:04:40.334 --> 00:04:42.567 position:10% line:89% align:start
So that's what you're after.

00:04:42.601 --> 00:04:43.567 position:21% line:89% align:start
Why are you whining?

00:04:43.601 --> 00:04:45.934 position:16% line:83% align:start
You make plenty at your
job in front London.

00:04:45.968 --> 00:04:48.167 position:16% line:83% align:start
Exchange as much as you
want, it's no big deal.

00:04:49.434 --> 00:04:51.834 position:10% line:83% align:start
Yeah. Except I have a little
something called pride

00:04:51.868 --> 00:04:54.167 position:16% line:83% align:start
you know and quit
saying stuff like that.

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:59.834 position:21% line:83% align:start
Huh? Oh no, I lost
achievement points.

00:04:59.868 --> 00:05:01.567 position:27% line:83% align:start
But I plucked the
flowers that bloom

00:05:01.601 --> 00:05:03.234 position:13% line:89% align:start
so they wouldn't find out.

00:05:03.267 --> 00:05:06.300 position:7% line:89% align:start
Yes, I got points, yay for me.

00:05:06.334 --> 00:05:07.334 position:35% line:89% align:start
But why?

00:05:08.834 --> 00:05:12.100 position:5% line:83% align:start
Because of my awesome show
stopping assist at the end, duh

00:05:12.133 --> 00:05:14.501 position:13% line:83% align:start
that's the only reason our
payload made it out safe.

00:05:15.601 --> 00:05:17.501 position:27% line:89% align:start
They're so cute.

00:05:17.534 --> 00:05:18.801 position:33% line:89% align:start
Cut it out.

00:05:18.834 --> 00:05:21.300 position:10% line:83% align:start
You don't want them to catch
you sneaking photos again.

00:05:21.334 --> 00:05:23.701 position:10% line:89% align:start
Hey, wait a minute, hold on.

00:05:23.734 --> 00:05:26.234 position:10% line:83% align:start
Why are you plucking flowers
off bud bucks anyway?

00:05:26.267 --> 00:05:29.100 position:24% line:83% align:start
Tell me, what was
I supposed to do?

00:05:29.133 --> 00:05:32.100 position:13% line:83% align:start
Bud bucks go down in price
when their flowers bloom.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.734 position:10% line:89% align:start
So I did it for our client.

00:05:35.834 --> 00:05:38.734 position:21% line:83% align:start
Look at that,
isn't it beautiful?

00:05:38.767 --> 00:05:41.133 position:5% line:89% align:start
You can touch it if you want to.

00:05:41.167 --> 00:05:43.067 position:7% line:89% align:start
But you can't have it though.

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:44.767 position:24% line:89% align:start
As if I'd want it.

00:05:44.801 --> 00:05:47.501 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Osushi] Let me
see your panties.

00:05:48.567 --> 00:05:50.567 position:16% line:89% align:start
Let me see your panties.

00:05:51.701 --> 00:05:53.767 position:13% line:89% align:start
[Balgo] Hey, Osushi, stop!

00:05:54.667 --> 00:05:55.901 position:13% line:89% align:start
[Boy] What is that thing?

00:05:55.934 --> 00:05:57.367 position:13% line:89% align:start
[Man] Is it a dark dragon?

00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:59.067 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Boy] In the middle of the city?

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:01.334 position:10% line:89% align:start
[Man] Nah, it's just Balgo.

00:06:02.234 --> 00:06:04.501 position:10% line:89% align:start
[Boy] Dammit, not him again.

00:06:06.133 --> 00:06:09.167 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Balgo] Come on Osushi,
calm down, pretty please.

00:06:10.501 --> 00:06:13.067 position:10% line:83% align:start
You're my cutie pie,
you're absolutely adorable.

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:15.334 position:19% line:89% align:start
Now please, calm down.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.300 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Ninny] Hey look,
it's Balgo and Osushi.

00:06:19.334 --> 00:06:20.868 position:13% line:89% align:start
[Noel] Oh yeah, so it is.

00:06:20.901 --> 00:06:23.467 position:7% line:83% align:start
[Ninny] Then I don't know,
maybe do something about them.

00:06:23.501 --> 00:06:25.467 position:24% line:83% align:start
You're the one in
charge of them.

00:06:25.501 --> 00:06:27.968 position:16% line:83% align:start
Correction, we're in
charge of them actually.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.734 position:16% line:83% align:start
He's your senior at
school though, isn't he?

00:06:30.767 --> 00:06:33.067 position:13% line:89% align:start
I mean it's probably fine.

00:06:33.934 --> 00:06:35.634 position:19% line:89% align:start
Look, he's all smiles.

00:06:35.667 --> 00:06:37.133 position:10% line:89% align:start
Why don't we have some tea?

00:06:38.834 --> 00:06:40.033 position:16% line:89% align:start
[Ninny] I want a latte.

00:06:40.067 --> 00:06:41.934 position:27% line:83% align:start
I'm happy to push
the button for you

00:06:41.968 --> 00:06:43.667 position:24% line:83% align:start
but you have to
put the money in.

00:06:44.634 --> 00:06:47.234 position:5% line:89% align:start
There's nothing fine about this.

00:06:47.267 --> 00:06:50.000 position:10% line:83% align:start
At this rate, Balgo's gonna
break his neck and die.

00:06:50.033 --> 00:06:51.968 position:19% line:83% align:start
We've been tasked with
keeping an eye on him

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:53.234 position:13% line:89% align:start
and making sure he's safe

00:06:53.267 --> 00:06:56.067 position:21% line:83% align:start
so I need both of
you to do your jobs.

00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:58.334 position:13% line:89% align:start
Us babysitting dragonclads

00:06:58.367 --> 00:07:00.467 position:27% line:83% align:start
is basically HQ's
super annoying way

00:07:00.501 --> 00:07:03.200 position:19% line:83% align:start
of making this
nonsense our problem.

00:07:03.234 --> 00:07:05.133 position:21% line:83% align:start
They don't even make
it worth our while.

00:07:05.167 --> 00:07:07.767 position:16% line:83% align:start
It's not like we get paid
or earn achievement points

00:07:07.801 --> 00:07:10.067 position:21% line:83% align:start
for keeping them
out of trouble 24/7

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:11.601 position:13% line:89% align:start
while doing our real job.

00:07:12.767 --> 00:07:14.267 position:7% line:89% align:start
So we're back to that, are we?

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:17.367 position:7% line:89% align:start
I figured you might say that.

00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:20.267 position:10% line:83% align:start
So I had a little chat with
some of the higher ups.

00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:21.734 position:5% line:89% align:start
I got you girls some extra money

00:07:21.767 --> 00:07:22.901 position:5% line:89% align:start
and achievement points for this.

00:07:22.934 --> 00:07:24.367 position:13% line:89% align:start
So how about then apples?

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:25.400 position:35% line:89% align:start
Say what?

00:07:27.734 --> 00:07:30.000 position:5% line:89% align:start
All right, fine, let's do this.

00:07:32.534 --> 00:07:33.334 position:30% line:89% align:start
Come on Niiha.

00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:36.200 position:5% line:89% align:start
You're doing this for the money.

00:07:36.234 --> 00:07:38.400 position:7% line:89% align:start
I'm doing it for the prestige,

00:07:38.434 --> 00:07:41.667 position:10% line:83% align:start
but so we don't sound awful,
we're doing it for society.

00:07:43.767 --> 00:07:44.767 position:44% line:89% align:start
Ugh.

00:07:45.834 --> 00:07:47.067 position:24% line:83% align:start
Could you maybe
try announcing the

00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:49.434 position:19% line:83% align:start
do it for society
part first, next time.

00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:53.434 position:33% line:89% align:start
(screaming)

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.033 position:19% line:89% align:start
Huh? What's happening?

00:08:02.067 --> 00:08:04.434 position:19% line:83% align:start
If you say so. You're
so smart, daddy.

00:08:04.467 --> 00:08:05.534 position:33% line:89% align:start
(screaming)

00:08:05.567 --> 00:08:07.701 position:16% line:89% align:start
Yeah. Who's my good boy?

00:08:07.734 --> 00:08:09.167 position:19% line:89% align:start
That's a good doggie.

00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:13.200 position:19% line:83% align:start
It sure is noisy
over there, isn't it?

00:08:13.234 --> 00:08:14.501 position:24% line:89% align:start
Yeah, it really is.

00:08:14.534 --> 00:08:16.567 position:13% line:83% align:start
Maybe there's a dragon on
the loose or something.

00:08:16.601 --> 00:08:18.067 position:13% line:89% align:start
Don't even joke about that

00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:21.234 position:16% line:83% align:start
and make sure it's spick
and span up there, okay?

00:08:21.267 --> 00:08:22.267 position:41% line:89% align:start
On it.

00:08:23.167 --> 00:08:26.167 position:24% line:89% align:start
(distant screaming)

00:08:28.834 --> 00:08:32.701 position:24% line:83% align:start
(screaming) Balgo
stop you idiot.

00:08:32.734 --> 00:08:33.901 position:21% line:89% align:start
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

00:08:33.934 --> 00:08:35.434 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Chimney Sweep] Don't
you come over here.

00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:38.934 position:33% line:89% align:start
(loud crash)

00:08:38.968 --> 00:08:40.200 position:24% line:83% align:start
My goodness, that
chimney sweep's

00:08:40.234 --> 00:08:41.667 position:10% line:89% align:start
really going at it isn't he.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.701 position:5% line:89% align:start
Sorry. I'm really, really sorry.

00:08:45.734 --> 00:08:47.133 position:21% line:89% align:start
Are you hurt at all?

00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:49.567 position:33% line:89% align:start
(loud crash)

00:08:49.601 --> 00:08:51.033 position:30% line:89% align:start
No. You moron.

00:08:51.067 --> 00:08:52.968 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'm not hurt, no thanks to you.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:54.901 position:21% line:83% align:start
I just don't want to
be getting arrested

00:08:54.934 --> 00:08:58.100 position:21% line:83% align:start
for violating the
dragon contact law.

00:08:58.133 --> 00:09:01.868 position:5% line:83% align:start
Wing Bind Headquarters is
right over there, are you nuts?

00:09:01.901 --> 00:09:04.234 position:33% line:89% align:start
(screaming)

00:09:08.734 --> 00:09:09.734 position:41% line:89% align:start
Noel!

00:09:10.834 --> 00:09:12.634 position:7% line:89% align:start
Thanks so much for saving me.

00:09:12.667 --> 00:09:13.467 position:24% line:89% align:start
Hey, are you blind?

00:09:13.501 --> 00:09:15.167 position:24% line:83% align:start
I'm the one who
saved you dumbass.

00:09:16.467 --> 00:09:18.501 position:21% line:89% align:start
There, there Osushi.

00:09:18.534 --> 00:09:19.734 position:16% line:89% align:start
It's time to calm down.

00:09:19.767 --> 00:09:20.767 position:35% line:89% align:start
Good dog.

00:09:24.167 --> 00:09:25.167 position:24% line:89% align:start
Osushi's calm now.

00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:29.067 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Ninny] And what did you do
to the poor thing anyway?

00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:31.667 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Balgo] Nothing, I was
just taking him for a walk.

00:09:32.901 --> 00:09:35.767 position:24% line:83% align:start
Thank you witches,
we appreciate it.

00:09:35.801 --> 00:09:38.334 position:10% line:89% align:start
So hey, about that chimney.

00:09:39.734 --> 00:09:40.901 position:19% line:89% align:start
Don't worry about it.

00:09:40.934 --> 00:09:43.534 position:19% line:83% align:start
Your dragon insurance
should cover it.

00:09:43.567 --> 00:09:47.234 position:7% line:83% align:start
More importantly, did you come
into contact with the dragon?

00:09:48.901 --> 00:09:50.534 position:19% line:89% align:start
I didn't, not at all.

00:09:50.567 --> 00:09:53.234 position:21% line:89% align:start
Niiha, run the test.

00:09:53.267 --> 00:09:54.267 position:41% line:89% align:start
Right.

00:09:55.601 --> 00:09:56.434 position:24% line:89% align:start
Please lick this.

00:09:58.434 --> 00:10:02.000 position:16% line:83% align:start
So, if someone touches
a dragon, what happens?

00:10:03.934 --> 00:10:06.734 position:16% line:83% align:start
For the protection of
both dragons and humans,

00:10:06.767 --> 00:10:11.734 position:7% line:83% align:start
the dragon contact prohibition
law was passed back in 1609.

00:10:11.767 --> 00:10:15.100 position:10% line:89% align:start
Violators face 100 years or-

00:10:16.067 --> 00:10:17.968 position:35% line:89% align:start
Execution.

00:10:18.033 --> 00:10:19.367 position:41% line:89% align:start
What?

00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:21.501 position:35% line:89% align:start
(ringing)

00:10:22.767 --> 00:10:24.968 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Noel] It's within
the normal range.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.067 position:41% line:89% align:start
(sigh)

00:10:27.100 --> 00:10:28.467 position:21% line:89% align:start
Yay, thank goodness!

00:10:28.501 --> 00:10:29.467 position:16% line:89% align:start
This is all your fault.

00:10:29.501 --> 00:10:30.501 position:35% line:89% align:start
I'm sorry!

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.567 position:27% line:83% align:start
Who do you think
caused this mess

00:10:34.601 --> 00:10:35.567 position:16% line:89% align:start
in the first place, huh?

00:10:35.601 --> 00:10:36.968 position:24% line:89% align:start
(punching sounds)

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.601 position:19% line:83% align:start
For the last time, why
don't you put a muzzle

00:10:39.634 --> 00:10:41.868 position:13% line:89% align:start
on Osushi when you go out?

00:10:41.901 --> 00:10:44.934 position:16% line:83% align:start
Being a dragonclad,
you're the only civilian

00:10:44.968 --> 00:10:47.434 position:19% line:83% align:start
who can touch Osushi
and not get locked up.

00:10:47.467 --> 00:10:48.501 position:24% line:89% align:start
Don't you get it?

00:10:49.133 --> 00:10:50.801 position:16% line:89% align:start
But I did put it on him.

00:10:50.834 --> 00:10:52.567 position:16% line:89% align:start
It just got ripped off.

00:10:52.601 --> 00:10:55.501 position:7% line:83% align:start
When Osushi suddenly sprouted
wings while we were walking.

00:10:57.100 --> 00:10:59.634 position:5% line:83% align:start
Did he really grow wings
without anything triggering it.

00:10:59.667 --> 00:11:01.467 position:35% line:89% align:start
Uh, yes.

00:11:01.501 --> 00:11:03.067 position:21% line:89% align:start
Where did it happen?

00:11:03.100 --> 00:11:05.267 position:10% line:89% align:start
Huh? You want to know where?

00:11:07.167 --> 00:11:08.601 position:16% line:89% align:start
Please try to remember.

00:11:10.801 --> 00:11:12.767 position:7% line:89% align:start
Osushi's wings usually appear

00:11:12.801 --> 00:11:14.501 position:5% line:89% align:start
when you try to bark like Osushi

00:11:15.601 --> 00:11:17.033 position:19% line:89% align:start
or whenever you sneeze

00:11:18.167 --> 00:11:20.100 position:13% line:83% align:start
or when you start
cracking up at something.

00:11:21.934 --> 00:11:24.067 position:19% line:89% align:start
So all the time then?

00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:27.567 position:19% line:83% align:start
Or when you're in
mortal danger, Balgo.

00:11:29.767 --> 00:11:31.434 position:33% line:89% align:start
(loud crash)

00:11:31.467 --> 00:11:33.567 position:33% line:89% align:start
(screaming)

00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:38.400 position:21% line:83% align:start
It happens because
you're a dragonclad.

00:11:38.434 --> 00:11:40.501 position:16% line:83% align:start
Dragons are aggressively
attracted to you.

00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:44.267 position:24% line:83% align:start
For now, I need
you to take Osushi

00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:46.734 position:7% line:83% align:start
and go somewhere where there's
as few people as possible

00:11:48.567 --> 00:11:50.567 position:16% line:89% align:start
Ninny, the barrier tape.

00:11:50.601 --> 00:11:51.601 position:41% line:89% align:start
On it.

00:11:52.767 --> 00:11:55.400 position:24% line:89% align:start
(tape scratching)

00:11:55.434 --> 00:11:57.400 position:30% line:89% align:start
So, what now?

00:11:57.434 --> 00:11:59.634 position:27% line:89% align:start
(monster scream)

00:11:59.667 --> 00:12:01.234 position:16% line:89% align:start
Magic number zero four.

00:12:02.467 --> 00:12:03.267 position:35% line:89% align:start
Stun ball.

00:12:04.467 --> 00:12:06.567 position:35% line:89% align:start
(clanging)

00:12:08.501 --> 00:12:11.133 position:33% line:89% align:start
(loud crash)

00:12:12.234 --> 00:12:14.434 position:19% line:83% align:start
So wait, what was the
point of the tape?

00:12:15.534 --> 00:12:16.934 position:30% line:89% align:start
Just in case.

00:12:16.968 --> 00:12:20.267 position:24% line:83% align:start
Oh, chief, we've
subdued a dragon.

00:12:20.300 --> 00:12:23.234 position:10% line:83% align:start
So I was thinking we should
get some kind of a bonus.

00:12:24.434 --> 00:12:25.667 position:24% line:89% align:start
Dragon insurance.

00:12:28.234 --> 00:12:31.434 position:24% line:83% align:start
No, there's no way
that's our fault.

00:12:31.467 --> 00:12:33.601 position:21% line:83% align:start
Please stop whining,
it's pathetic.

00:12:35.167 --> 00:12:36.400 position:13% line:89% align:start
[Chief] So, you're saying

00:12:36.434 --> 00:12:38.934 position:19% line:83% align:start
you don't know what
kind of dragon it is?

00:12:38.968 --> 00:12:40.634 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Noel] That's exactly
what I'm saying.

00:12:40.667 --> 00:12:41.901 position:10% line:89% align:start
I've never seen one like it,

00:12:41.934 --> 00:12:44.100 position:5% line:89% align:start
so I don't know what kind it is.

00:12:45.434 --> 00:12:46.367 position:33% line:89% align:start
(loud crash)

00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:47.801 position:19% line:83% align:start
It was pretty worked
up and flailing about

00:12:47.834 --> 00:12:49.567 position:7% line:89% align:start
so I stunned it to shut it up.

00:12:50.234 --> 00:12:51.501 position:41% line:89% align:start
Niiha!

00:12:51.534 --> 00:12:53.334 position:27% line:89% align:start
(rope snapping)

00:12:53.367 --> 00:12:55.334 position:33% line:89% align:start
(loud crash)

00:12:55.367 --> 00:12:58.133 position:27% line:89% align:start
(water spraying)

00:13:02.901 --> 00:13:05.734 position:27% line:89% align:start
(metal crushing)

00:13:09.834 --> 00:13:12.400 position:21% line:83% align:start
I could have sworn
it went lights out.

00:13:12.434 --> 00:13:15.067 position:30% line:89% align:start
(birds cawing)

00:13:17.667 --> 00:13:19.100 position:33% line:89% align:start
It's coming.

00:13:19.133 --> 00:13:21.267 position:24% line:83% align:start
We need to lure
it away from here.

00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:22.100 position:38% line:89% align:start
I know.

00:13:26.601 --> 00:13:28.133 position:38% line:89% align:start
(crash)

00:13:28.167 --> 00:13:31.534 position:24% line:89% align:start
(heavy footsteps)

00:13:31.567 --> 00:13:33.400 position:33% line:89% align:start
(loud crash)

00:13:33.434 --> 00:13:35.400 position:5% line:83% align:start
-(screaming)
-All right, this should be good.

00:13:35.434 --> 00:13:37.634 position:19% line:83% align:start
(loud crash)
Hey! Oh, come on man.

00:13:37.667 --> 00:13:40.067 position:10% line:83% align:start
You're making this really
difficult for us to call in.

00:13:40.100 --> 00:13:41.801 position:7% line:89% align:start
[Noel] Ninny, in front of you.

00:13:41.834 --> 00:13:44.400 position:30% line:89% align:start
(birds cawing)

00:13:44.434 --> 00:13:47.133 position:30% line:89% align:start
(wind roaring)

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:51.734 position:33% line:89% align:start
(loud crash)

00:13:51.767 --> 00:13:54.100 position:33% line:89% align:start
(screaming)

00:13:55.901 --> 00:13:57.234 position:33% line:89% align:start
(loud crash)

00:13:57.267 --> 00:14:00.334 position:13% line:83% align:start
Chief, a dragon blockade.
Rutherford street.

00:14:01.267 --> 00:14:03.100 position:7% line:89% align:start
We've got a dark dragon here.

00:14:04.901 --> 00:14:07.400 position:24% line:89% align:start
(bricks crunching)

00:14:07.434 --> 00:14:09.601 position:35% line:89% align:start
(gasping)

00:14:12.067 --> 00:14:14.767 position:27% line:89% align:start
(metal clinking)

00:14:16.167 --> 00:14:18.734 position:7% line:89% align:start
[Civilian] What's that sound?

00:14:18.767 --> 00:14:20.634 position:24% line:89% align:start
(bricks crunching)

00:14:20.667 --> 00:14:21.968 position:27% line:89% align:start
(spraying sound)

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.334 position:33% line:89% align:start
(screaming)

00:14:25.767 --> 00:14:29.300 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Reporter] This is a notice
from BBC Reverse London.

00:14:29.334 --> 00:14:31.934 position:10% line:89% align:start
Due to a dark dragon alert,

00:14:31.968 --> 00:14:35.501 position:16% line:83% align:start
Rutherford street is now
under a dragon blockade.

00:14:36.767 --> 00:14:38.601 position:7% line:89% align:start
Anyone in the nearby vicinity

00:14:38.634 --> 00:14:41.467 position:5% line:89% align:start
should seek shelter immediately.

00:14:41.501 --> 00:14:44.601 position:16% line:83% align:start
Wing Bind has the
situation under control.

00:14:45.667 --> 00:14:47.567 position:21% line:83% align:start
You know what always
gets under my skin.

00:14:47.601 --> 00:14:49.167 position:16% line:89% align:start
Doesn't it piss you off

00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:51.400 position:13% line:83% align:start
when they say Wing Bind has
the situation under control?

00:14:51.434 --> 00:14:52.601 position:27% line:89% align:start
Annoying, right?

00:14:52.634 --> 00:14:55.534 position:10% line:83% align:start
Not really, I mean, it is
our job after all, you know.

00:14:55.567 --> 00:14:57.467 position:16% line:89% align:start
That's not what I mean.

00:14:57.501 --> 00:15:00.067 position:19% line:83% align:start
I'd be fine with it if
we said it ourselves.

00:15:00.100 --> 00:15:02.267 position:24% line:83% align:start
Why is the BBC the
one announcing it?

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:05.133 position:35% line:89% align:start
Hi chief.

00:15:05.167 --> 00:15:06.901 position:7% line:89% align:start
The dragon blockade's set up.

00:15:06.934 --> 00:15:08.501 position:21% line:83% align:start
It's time we tagged
in the Sabres.

00:15:09.601 --> 00:15:12.033 position:10% line:89% align:start
[Chief] Hello? Noel, Hello?

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.534 position:21% line:83% align:start
Sorry. What do you
think you're doing?

00:15:15.567 --> 00:15:17.133 position:16% line:89% align:start
That's usually my line.

00:15:17.167 --> 00:15:19.567 position:10% line:83% align:start
You're gonna let the
Sabres take all the credit?

00:15:21.667 --> 00:15:23.868 position:30% line:89% align:start
(loud whistle)

00:15:23.901 --> 00:15:25.467 position:19% line:89% align:start
We can't pass this up.

00:15:25.501 --> 00:15:28.200 position:24% line:83% align:start
A chance to show
HR our true power.

00:15:28.234 --> 00:15:30.267 position:24% line:83% align:start
Our duty as Pipers
is a simple one.

00:15:30.300 --> 00:15:32.634 position:10% line:83% align:start
Take the dragons to pasture
and harvest from them.

00:15:32.667 --> 00:15:33.701 position:7% line:89% align:start
We don't need to be powerful.

00:15:33.734 --> 00:15:37.133 position:7% line:89% align:start
Yeah yeah, like I said before.

00:15:37.167 --> 00:15:41.033 position:16% line:83% align:start
My mission is to become
one of the Sabers.

00:15:41.067 --> 00:15:43.300 position:24% line:89% align:start
(loud sonic boom)

00:15:43.334 --> 00:15:46.000 position:7% line:83% align:start
Personally that doesn't
interest me in the slightest.

00:15:48.601 --> 00:15:51.434 position:24% line:89% align:start
(heavy footsteps)

00:15:52.667 --> 00:15:55.000 position:33% line:89% align:start
(loud bang)

00:15:59.734 --> 00:16:00.734 position:30% line:89% align:start
Ha, I hit him.

00:16:00.767 --> 00:16:01.734 position:27% line:89% align:start
(rope snapping)

00:16:01.767 --> 00:16:02.767 position:41% line:89% align:start
Whoa.

00:16:03.667 --> 00:16:08.667 position:7% line:89% align:start
Magic number 28, rainy wheel.

00:16:09.834 --> 00:16:12.000 position:35% line:89% align:start
(panting)

00:16:15.434 --> 00:16:18.567 position:24% line:89% align:start
(wet jiggle sound)

00:16:18.601 --> 00:16:20.400 position:35% line:89% align:start
Help me.

00:16:20.434 --> 00:16:22.801 position:24% line:89% align:start
(clothes rustling)

00:16:22.834 --> 00:16:24.033 position:41% line:89% align:start
Balgo.

00:16:25.367 --> 00:16:27.601 position:33% line:89% align:start
(loud horn)

00:16:28.934 --> 00:16:30.434 position:24% line:83% align:start
Don't worry, just
leave this to me.

00:16:32.667 --> 00:16:36.701 position:5% line:89% align:start
Magic number 75. Gatling crown.

00:16:36.734 --> 00:16:39.267 position:30% line:89% align:start
(wind roaring)

00:16:42.834 --> 00:16:46.067 position:13% line:89% align:start
Hey, this is a huge deal.

00:16:46.100 --> 00:16:47.868 position:10% line:89% align:start
How many years has it been?

00:16:47.901 --> 00:16:48.868 position:35% line:89% align:start
A century?

00:16:48.901 --> 00:16:50.901 position:7% line:89% align:start
[Roy] 96 years to be precise.

00:16:50.934 --> 00:16:54.067 position:16% line:5% align:start
huh? Yeah, that's
basically century dude.

00:16:54.100 --> 00:16:57.133 position:13% line:83% align:start
Anyway, like I was saying,
it's been a whole century

00:16:57.167 --> 00:17:00.701 position:5% line:83% align:start
since we last let a dark
dragon get into reverse London.

00:17:00.734 --> 00:17:03.634 position:10% line:83% align:start
If this isn't a catastrophe,
what the hell is?

00:17:03.667 --> 00:17:05.801 position:13% line:89% align:start
Could you show up for once

00:17:05.834 --> 00:17:08.534 position:13% line:89% align:start
and you stop chewing gum.

00:17:08.567 --> 00:17:11.234 position:7% line:83% align:start
You guys seriously have
nothing to say about all this?

00:17:11.267 --> 00:17:14.667 position:19% line:83% align:start
Am I the only one
pissed off here? Huh?

00:17:14.701 --> 00:17:16.400 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'm pretty sure I spoke earlier.

00:17:18.100 --> 00:17:22.067 position:13% line:83% align:start
Whatever. Anyway, my point
is the problem is that

00:17:22.100 --> 00:17:26.133 position:5% line:83% align:start
this Balgo guy just runs
around doing whatever he wants.

00:17:26.167 --> 00:17:28.234 position:7% line:89% align:start
What do you say old man Wolfy?

00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:33.067 position:13% line:5% align:start
Trust me, this individual
has been the topic

00:17:33.100 --> 00:17:35.534 position:10% line:5% align:start
of countless heated
discussions within our squad

00:17:35.567 --> 00:17:39.033 position:10% line:5% align:start
in just the one month since
he became a dragonclad.

00:17:40.267 --> 00:17:44.234 position:13% line:83% align:start
This situation occurred
due to our own negligence.

00:17:44.267 --> 00:17:46.667 position:21% line:83% align:start
Therefore, we cannot
simply ignore it.

00:17:47.934 --> 00:17:50.067 position:16% line:83% align:start
We will proceed with the
plan to eliminate the

00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:52.567 position:5% line:89% align:start
dragonclad known as Balgo Parks.

00:17:55.601 --> 00:17:57.334 position:35% line:89% align:start
(laughing)

00:17:57.367 --> 00:18:00.033 position:27% line:89% align:start
(bells ringing)

00:18:09.234 --> 00:18:14.234 position:19% line:89% align:start
(closing theme music)

00:19:42.434 --> 00:19:44.601 position:35% line:89% align:start
(purring)

00:19:46.267 --> 00:19:49.567 position:19% line:89% align:start
(electricity sparking)

00:19:50.567 --> 00:19:53.100 position:30% line:89% align:start
(door opening)
