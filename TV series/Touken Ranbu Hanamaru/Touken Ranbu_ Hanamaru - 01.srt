Souji was wielding me
long ago at the Ikedaya Inn.

I know, it was just a dream.

But it's strange.

It felt so real.

[KASHUU] You've only been
at the citadel for one day

and you're already worked up.

take a walk, okay?

Good idea.

what a Nue is?

The world's future will
be decided by guns.

Practicing with guns
instead of swords

93

is way more useful
for actual combat.

need more practice.

think were you doing?

This is just our way
of getting exercise.

We've been lazing around

Don't try to pass
the blame, Namazuo!

118

Honestly, we just wanted
to play with Yamatonokami.

don't get those that often.

[SHOKUDAIKIRI]
Is that true?

121
00:07:47,125 --> 00:07:47,958
Pretty much.

122
00:07:48,041 --> 00:07:50,000
It was just snowballs!

Well, on one hand,
at least you're honest.

124

But who in the hell cares?!

125
00:07:54,291 --> 00:07:56,416
We're supposed to be
swords--warriors, remember?

Have you forgotten
our sworn duty?

127
00:07:58,875 --> 00:08:00,500
Not this again.

128
00:08:00,583 --> 00:08:02,083
Let's make a snowman next time!

129

[HASEBE] Hey! Are you
listening to me, you guys?

130
00:08:05,625 --> 00:08:07,125
No, I get it.

131
00:08:07,208 --> 00:08:09,750
But who says Sword Warriors
can't throw snowballs around?

132
00:08:09,833 --> 00:08:12,166
We are all different,
but we all have our pride.

133
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:14,291
I was Lord Yoshitsune's
blade, y'know.

134
00:08:14,375 --> 00:08:16,791
And just like I was
Sakamoto Ryouma's blade.

135
00:08:16,875 --> 00:08:21,125
Yes, and just like Yasusada and
I were Okita Souji's blades.

136
00:08:21,208 --> 00:08:22,958
That's why we're here, right?

137
00:08:23,041 --> 00:08:25,458
Ah. Now you're making
me all nostalgic.

[SOUZA sighs]

139
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,291
[SOUZA] It's hard for me to
share the same sentiment.

140
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:31,916
I was passed from one
conqueror to the next.

141
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,666
I'm nothing more than
a bird in a golden cage.

142
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:36,041
[HASEBE]
Enough about the past!

143
00:08:36,125 --> 00:08:37,500
That's not the issue.

144
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:40,500
Perhaps you should reflect
on why our leader, the Sage,

145
00:08:40,583 --> 00:08:42,708
gave us human form
in the first place.

146
00:08:42,791 --> 00:08:45,000
It was to protect
history, wasn't it?

147
00:08:45,083 --> 00:08:46,375
That's right.

148
00:08:46,458 --> 00:08:49,291
Our enemies are the
Historical Revisionists.

149
00:08:49,375 --> 00:08:51,541
Their History Retrograde Army

150
00:08:51,625 --> 00:08:53,250
appears at different
points in time

151
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:55,291
in order to alter the future.

152
00:08:55,375 --> 00:08:57,458
Our purpose is to
defeat them wherever

153
00:08:57,541 --> 00:08:59,125
and whenever they appear,

154
00:08:59,208 --> 00:09:01,541
in order to preserve
our current timeline.

155
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:03,208
Now do you get my point?

156
00:09:03,291 --> 00:09:04,791
What point?

157
00:09:04,875 --> 00:09:07,125
[HASEBE] Snowball fights do not
factor into any part of that!

158
00:09:07,208 --> 00:09:08,541
Don't you see?

159
00:09:08,625 --> 00:09:10,833
We never know when our Master
will call us into battle

160
00:09:10,916 --> 00:09:11,833
with our foes.

161
00:09:11,916 --> 00:09:14,875
We must be ever vigilant!

162
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:16,416
What a bore.

163
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:19,375
If I take a little nap, will you
wake me when he's done?

164
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:21,708
Hey, it's Nikkari.

165
00:09:21,791 --> 00:09:24,041
All these snowballs are
just begging to be thrown,

166
00:09:24,125 --> 00:09:25,333
aren't they?

167
00:09:25,416 --> 00:09:26,833
Don't you dare!

168
00:09:26,916 --> 00:09:28,375
My impassioned speech was
finally getting through to them,

169
00:09:28,458 --> 00:09:29,833
I think!

170
00:09:29,916 --> 00:09:32,666
They say you get wrinkles
if you frown all the time.

171
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:35,083
Try smiling more. Like I do.

172
00:09:35,166 --> 00:09:37,041
[HASEBE]
I'll smile when I'm dead!

173
00:09:37,125 --> 00:09:39,291
Speaking of death, would it
kill you to get here on time?

174
00:09:39,375 --> 00:09:41,041
[YAGEN] Well, this was
a productive assembly.

175
00:09:41,125 --> 00:09:42,583
[HASEBE]
I mean, it's ridiculous!

176
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:46,333
[SHISHIOU] I don't get those
History Retrograde guys.

177
00:09:46,416 --> 00:09:49,250
If they wanna change the world,
they can do it in the present.

178
00:09:49,333 --> 00:09:51,750
Messing with the past'll
just screw everything up.

179
00:09:51,833 --> 00:09:53,916
I dunno, since I was
just a sword in the past,

180
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,291
I can kinda see the appeal.

181
00:09:55,375 --> 00:09:56,916
I mean, I've got a body now.

182
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,375
There's all sorts of
things I'd like to do

183
00:09:58,458 --> 00:10:00,333
back in the time I came from.

184
00:10:00,416 --> 00:10:02,416
Since we still have our memories
from when we were swords,

185
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,083
isn't it tempting?

186
00:10:04,166 --> 00:10:06,166
Yeah, I get it now.

187
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:08,333
I'd love to see my old man.

188
00:10:08,416 --> 00:10:09,416
[MUTSUNOKAMI laughs]

189
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:11,375
We could talk
to them face-to-face!

190
00:10:11,458 --> 00:10:13,750
We'd smile and say all
the things we couldn't say

191
00:10:13,833 --> 00:10:15,083
when we were swords.

192
00:10:15,166 --> 00:10:17,375
And then, since we know
how the future plays out,

193
00:10:17,458 --> 00:10:18,958
we could share some advice.

194
00:10:19,041 --> 00:10:20,416
That is strictly forbidden.

195
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:21,416
[gasp]

196
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:23,125
Have you been here
the whole time?!

197
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:25,958
[SHOKUDAIKIRI]
It's backwards, don't you think?

198
00:10:26,041 --> 00:10:29,833
Well, ya know, we're supposed to
protect history, not change it.

199
00:10:29,916 --> 00:10:32,208
[NIKKARI chuckles]
You make a good point.

200
00:10:32,291 --> 00:10:33,541
Maybe.

201
00:10:33,625 --> 00:10:35,750
But I don't get how changing
the past even works.

202
00:10:35,833 --> 00:10:37,416
Like, what would happen to us?

203
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:40,333
And we have to go
back in time to fight.

204
00:10:40,416 --> 00:10:42,291
What if we make a mistake?

205
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:45,125
That's why Hasebe wants
things in perfect order.

206
00:10:45,208 --> 00:10:46,958
I haven't been here long,
but I've heard his speech

207
00:10:47,041 --> 00:10:48,541
five times now.

208
00:10:48,625 --> 00:10:50,416
You're lucky. I've been
here from the start.

209
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:51,916
Imagine what I've gone through.

210
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,958
We've been given
an important mission.

211
00:10:54,041 --> 00:10:56,416
It doesn't hurt to
humor him, right?

212
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:57,416
[NAMAZUO]
Ha!

213
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:58,916
[YASUSADA]
Ishikirimaru, look out!

214
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:06,083
Hey, Namazuo. What's this?

215
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:07,291
It's horse manure!

216
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:08,916
And nice catch, by the way!

217
00:11:11,333 --> 00:11:12,416
[IMANOTSURUGI]
Big news, you guys!

218
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:13,458
[ALL]
Huh?

219
00:11:13,541 --> 00:11:15,083
The enemy is attacking!

220
00:11:20,583 --> 00:11:22,125
[HASEBE] Are you sure you
don't want me to clean up

221
00:11:22,208 --> 00:11:23,500
this clutter, Master?

222
00:11:24,958 --> 00:11:26,375
Wait!

223
00:11:26,458 --> 00:11:27,916
I just received an emergency
message from the government!

224
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,166
The enemy is attacking
the Ikedaya Inn!

225
00:11:31,666 --> 00:11:33,625
According to the information
Konnosuke gave me,

226
00:11:33,708 --> 00:11:35,375
it's a small,
but formidable team

227
00:11:35,458 --> 00:11:37,041
from the History
Retrograde Army.

228
00:11:37,125 --> 00:11:38,708
Of course, we will
dispatch immediately,

229
00:11:38,791 --> 00:11:40,333
as soon as you
give your orders.

230
00:11:41,916 --> 00:11:44,250
Oh. You've formulated
a list of the six swords

231
00:11:44,333 --> 00:11:45,416
for the mission already?

232
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:46,666
This is a key moment in history,

233
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:49,583
so I would expect
only the strongest.

234
00:11:49,666 --> 00:11:52,083
Can I assume that
I'm on the list, then?

235
00:11:52,166 --> 00:11:53,625
Uh, no, never mind.

236
00:11:53,708 --> 00:11:55,291
I'll see myself out.

237
00:11:57,208 --> 00:11:59,250
Don't hesitate to call on me.

238
00:11:59,333 --> 00:12:01,666
My only purpose is to serve you.

239
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:03,125
I shall rush to your side.

240
00:12:03,208 --> 00:12:05,375
At any time, for any reason.

241
00:12:08,958 --> 00:12:10,083
Are you sure?

242
00:12:10,166 --> 00:12:11,500
That's what Hasebe said.

243
00:12:11,583 --> 00:12:12,958
At the Ikedaya Inn.

244
00:12:13,041 --> 00:12:14,833
I heard him talking
to the Master.

245
00:12:14,916 --> 00:12:16,333
That sounds messy.

246
00:12:16,416 --> 00:12:18,708
We don't have the experience
to tackle a job like that.

247
00:12:18,791 --> 00:12:21,458
He's right. I'm afraid our
team still needs more training.

248
00:12:21,541 --> 00:12:24,166
That's the famous raid
by the Shinsengumi, right?

249
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:26,666
What do you think the
enemy wants to change?

250
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:29,166
We've got the expert here.
Let's ask him.

251
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:30,750
Oh, I almost forgot.

252
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:32,750
You were there for that,
weren't you, Kashuu?

253
00:12:32,833 --> 00:12:34,583
Yeah. I was.

254
00:12:34,666 --> 00:12:38,000
You think they got a problem
with the Shinsengumi, or what?

255
00:12:38,083 --> 00:12:39,250
[KASHUU]
Hmm...

256
00:12:39,333 --> 00:12:41,541
If the enemy aided the
anti-shogunate faction,

257
00:12:41,625 --> 00:12:44,208
the Shinsengumi would
surely fail in their raid.

258
00:12:44,291 --> 00:12:45,708
Then what?

259
00:12:45,791 --> 00:12:48,541
[KASHUU] The rebel's plan
would go off without a hitch.

260
00:12:48,625 --> 00:12:51,000
And Kyoto would
burn to the ground.

261
00:12:51,083 --> 00:12:53,083
Well, sounds like that would
change history, all right.

262
00:12:53,166 --> 00:12:55,750
Even if we're outmatched,
we gotta head 'em off.

263
00:12:56,916 --> 00:12:59,250
[YASUSADA]
I have to protect Souji.

264
00:12:59,333 --> 00:13:02,666
[HASEBE] Everyone's here except
for those on expeditions, yes?

265
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:06,000
This was personally
entrusted to me by our Master.

266
00:13:06,083 --> 00:13:09,000
It contains a list of the
six members going to the inn.

267
00:13:09,083 --> 00:13:10,208
I hope it's me!

268
00:13:10,291 --> 00:13:12,041
I'll make my old man proud.

269
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:13,791
[HASEBE] Some of you
may be aware of this,

270
00:13:13,875 --> 00:13:16,166
but the odds are
not in our favor.

271
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:18,500
Regardless, I'm sure
that our Master's judgment

272
00:13:18,583 --> 00:13:20,250
will see us through.

273
00:13:20,333 --> 00:13:22,000
[HASEBE] Master, I'm certain
that you will place

274
00:13:22,083 --> 00:13:24,125
your faith in me,
and I vow that I will

275
00:13:24,208 --> 00:13:27,083
not disappoint you,
so long as I live!

276
00:13:27,166 --> 00:13:28,458
[SHOKUDAIKIRI]
Something wrong?

277
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:30,583
Nothing. Let's proceed.

278
00:13:30,666 --> 00:13:33,958
I will call out your name
as well as your sword type.

279
00:13:34,041 --> 00:13:35,500
The captain will be last.

280
00:13:35,583 --> 00:13:36,833
Just lemme fight already.

281
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:38,666
The tension is killing me!

282
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:40,541
[HASEBE]
Tantou Imanotsurugi.

283
00:13:40,625 --> 00:13:42,583
Ha! I got this!

284
00:13:42,666 --> 00:13:43,875
Don't you worry!

285
00:13:43,958 --> 00:13:45,500
[HASEBE]
And don't you get too cocky.

286
00:13:45,583 --> 00:13:47,291
Now, the next member.

287
00:13:47,375 --> 00:13:50,666
Wakizashi Nikkari Aoe.

288
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:52,625
The Master likes me.

289
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:56,166
Whatever. Next up.

290
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:59,583
Ootachi Ishikirimaru.

291
00:13:59,666 --> 00:14:01,208
Hello? Did you hear me?

292
00:14:01,291 --> 00:14:02,375
[ISHIKIRIMARU]
Just a minute!

293
00:14:04,375 --> 00:14:06,708
[HASEBE] Why are you
bathing at a time like this?

294
00:14:06,791 --> 00:14:08,250
I got some manure on my hands,

295
00:14:08,333 --> 00:14:09,625
but when I came
here to wash them,

296
00:14:09,708 --> 00:14:12,250
I couldn't resist the
allure of a warm bath.

297
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:15,125
You're the base's
very first <i>ootachi</i> sword.

298
00:14:15,208 --> 00:14:17,208
So our Master has
high hopes for you.

299
00:14:17,291 --> 00:14:20,541
Wash whatever you need to
wash and then report for duty.

300
00:14:20,625 --> 00:14:21,750
Understood.

301
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:24,916
Ah! Maybe wait till I leave.

302
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:25,958
I see.

303
00:14:26,041 --> 00:14:28,083
[HASEBE]
On to the fourth member.

304
00:14:28,166 --> 00:14:31,333
[HASEBE]
Hmph. Surely it's me.

305
00:14:31,416 --> 00:14:33,791
Wakizashi Namazuo Toushirou.

306
00:14:33,875 --> 00:14:35,708
[NAMAZUO]
All right! Leave it to me!

307
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:37,375
[HASEBE]
Well, I shouldn't complain.

308
00:14:37,458 --> 00:14:40,416
He is quite skilled and
there's still two more slots.

309
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,416
[HASEBE gasps]
An <i>uchigatana</i> !

310
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:44,500
Of course,
Master saved me for last.

311
00:14:46,291 --> 00:14:47,958
Kashuu Kiyomitsu?

312
00:14:48,041 --> 00:14:48,958
[KASHUU]
Ready!

313
00:14:49,041 --> 00:14:51,333
This is my fifth
dispatch in a row.

314
00:14:51,416 --> 00:14:53,583
I must be popular.

315
00:14:53,666 --> 00:14:54,875
[HASEBE]
Another fine warrior,

316
00:14:54,958 --> 00:14:57,791
but my talents shine
as a leader, of course.

317
00:14:57,875 --> 00:14:59,791
And the captain is...
an <i>uchigatana</i> !

318
00:14:59,875 --> 00:15:01,041
Worry not, Master.

319
00:15:01,125 --> 00:15:02,000
Leave this to...

320
00:15:02,083 --> 00:15:03,250
...Yamatonokami?

321
00:15:04,625 --> 00:15:06,625
[HASEBE]
Yamatonokami Yasusada.

322
00:15:07,583 --> 00:15:08,833
Me?

323
00:15:08,916 --> 00:15:11,583
Captain on his first mission?

324
00:15:11,666 --> 00:15:13,375
Sure you can handle this?

325
00:15:13,458 --> 00:15:15,041
Um, yeah.

326
00:15:15,125 --> 00:15:17,000
Give it your best.

327
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:18,875
Oh, Master, you're so cruel!

328
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:20,666
Why have you forsaken me?!

329
00:15:27,333 --> 00:15:28,583
The Ikedaya Inn.

330
00:15:28,666 --> 00:15:30,041
And your first mission.

331
00:15:31,833 --> 00:15:33,333
[YASUSADA]
It was a desperate battle

332
00:15:33,416 --> 00:15:35,291
even before there
was any interference.

333
00:15:36,291 --> 00:15:37,250
[KASHUU]
Hey.

334
00:15:38,583 --> 00:15:40,000
[KASHUU]
Here's an idea.

335
00:15:40,083 --> 00:15:42,083
Why don't we take out the
rebels while we're there, too?

336
00:15:43,708 --> 00:15:46,625
If the Shinsengumi
went to the Ikedaya Inn,

337
00:15:46,708 --> 00:15:49,750
and the anti-shogunate
faction was already wiped out

338
00:15:49,833 --> 00:15:52,125
then Souji--Well, you know.

339
00:15:52,208 --> 00:15:54,791
To be honest, that was
the first thing I thought of.

340
00:15:54,875 --> 00:15:57,916
If Souji wasn't forced to
fight in that battle, then...

341
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,541
[KASHUU]
You moron!

342
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:01,041
You think I was serious?

343
00:16:01,125 --> 00:16:04,000
Like Hasebe said, we're
here to protect history.

344
00:16:04,083 --> 00:16:05,666
I was just baiting you.

345
00:16:13,958 --> 00:16:15,083
[NIKKARI]
Taking your time today?

346
00:16:15,166 --> 00:16:16,208
[IMANOTSURUGI]
Yeah, come on, let's go!

347
00:16:16,291 --> 00:16:17,250
[KASHUU]
What's this?

348
00:16:17,333 --> 00:16:19,791
Hasebe and Shokudaikiri
are here?

349
00:16:19,875 --> 00:16:21,916
Do you have to see us off?

350
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,583
We're worried, that's all.

351
00:16:23,666 --> 00:16:25,791
I don't care how strong
you are; this is going to be

352
00:16:25,875 --> 00:16:27,500
a difficult fight.

353
00:16:27,583 --> 00:16:29,125
[KASHUU]
So we were told.

354
00:16:29,208 --> 00:16:30,916
Yamatonokami.

355
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,333
As captain, there is only
one job you must complete.

356
00:16:34,416 --> 00:16:37,500
Annihilate the History
Retrograde Army?

357
00:16:37,583 --> 00:16:38,791
No.

358
00:16:38,875 --> 00:16:41,958
Then protect the world's
history from changing?

359
00:16:42,041 --> 00:16:43,750
Not quite.

360
00:16:43,833 --> 00:16:45,291
Protect your teammates.

361
00:16:45,375 --> 00:16:47,291
Get everyone back here safely.

362
00:16:48,583 --> 00:16:51,083
[HASEBE] There are some things
that our Master can't say.

363
00:16:51,166 --> 00:16:53,666
So I'm going to tell
you this in their stead.

364
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:56,583
If you're injured,
then retreat immediately.

365
00:16:56,666 --> 00:16:59,416
You cannot let pride
cloud your judgment.

366
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:01,208
Retreating isn't defeat.

367
00:17:01,291 --> 00:17:02,500
Death is defeat.

368
00:17:02,583 --> 00:17:04,333
There's always a second chance.

369
00:17:04,416 --> 00:17:05,291
Yes, sir.

370
00:17:05,375 --> 00:17:06,083
[HASEBE]
Good.

371
00:17:06,166 --> 00:17:07,583
Then take this with you.

372
00:17:07,666 --> 00:17:09,125
[YASUSADA]
A protection charm?

373
00:17:09,208 --> 00:17:10,750
[HASEBE]
Courtesy of our Master.

374
00:17:10,833 --> 00:17:14,208
Your talents are untested,
and this is a dangerous mission.

375
00:17:14,291 --> 00:17:16,750
It's not much, but it
may improve your odds.

376
00:17:16,833 --> 00:17:17,833
[YASUSADA]
Thank you.

377
00:17:17,916 --> 00:17:20,333
Thank the Master
when you return safely.

378
00:17:20,416 --> 00:17:21,958
I've said all I can say.

379
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:23,708
It's time to start the mission!

380
00:17:30,041 --> 00:17:32,083
Don't worry. Let me handle it.

381
00:17:34,875 --> 00:17:36,541
Easy. I'll teach you later.

382
00:17:36,625 --> 00:17:37,625
Okay, thanks.

383
00:17:38,916 --> 00:17:40,708
Well then. I guess we're off.

384
00:17:40,791 --> 00:17:42,208
Come back safe.

385
00:17:42,291 --> 00:17:43,500
And good luck.

386
00:17:53,666 --> 00:17:55,000
[IMANOTSURUGI]
C'mon!

387
00:17:55,083 --> 00:17:57,166
We gotta finish them off
before the Shinsengumi show up!

388
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:59,666
Captain, what is our strategy?

389
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:02,750
I'm going to push ahead to the
inn's second floor on my own.

390
00:18:02,833 --> 00:18:04,958
You take out the enemies
on the first floor.

391
00:18:05,041 --> 00:18:07,375
When you're done fighting,
then rejoin with me.

392
00:18:07,458 --> 00:18:08,500
Sounds good.

393
00:18:09,875 --> 00:18:11,625
[YASUSADA] I'll follow in
your footsteps, Souji.

394
00:18:11,708 --> 00:18:12,708
I'm ready.

395
00:18:21,125 --> 00:18:23,041
Huh... It's awfully quiet.

396

That was fun.
Shall we continue?

00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:36,208
Of course.

for a good fight!

I'm the captain--I'll be okay!

[YASUSADA] I'll cut all
of you straight through.

I'll fight to the end,

[YASUSADA]
I don't know.

Darn it, and you
messed up my clothes, too.

[YAGEN chuckles]

You really went
all out, didn't you?

Ah... Ow!

stay still, please.

[KASHUU laughs]

432

It could have been worse, but
that wasn't exactly a success.

Although you survived,

434
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:43,333
there's still a chance they
could return to the Ikedaya Inn.

00:20:43,416 --> 00:20:44,750
It'll be okay.

436
00:20:44,833 --> 00:20:46,541
That was a warm-up.

437
00:20:46,625 --> 00:20:48,708
[KASHUU] Can I use the
repair room already?

438
00:20:48,791 --> 00:20:50,833
I broke a nail.
It's an emergency.

The room's all full.

I'm afraid you'll have to cope.

When they're done,
next in line is...
