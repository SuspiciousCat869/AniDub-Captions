00:00:08,416 --> 00:00:10,833
[IWATOOSHI]
The year is 2205 AD.

2
00:00:16,208 --> 00:00:18,958
The History Retrograde Army
seeks to control the world

3
00:00:19,041 --> 00:00:20,541
by altering its past.

4
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:23,541
Born from the heart of swords,

5
00:00:23,625 --> 00:00:27,375
we travel through time to
intercept and eliminate them.

6
00:00:30,041 --> 00:00:32,666
[laughing]

7
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:05,041
[KASHUU, YASUSADA]
This is a tale of the legendary

8
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:07,500
Sword Warriors
and the Hanamaru days

9
00:02:07,583 --> 00:02:10,333
they spent in a certain citadel.

10
00:02:21,416 --> 00:02:22,916
[IMANOTSURUGI]
I hope you're ready!

11
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,041
[IWATOOSHI]
Jump!

12
00:02:24,125 --> 00:02:25,125
[IMANOTSURUGI]
On it!

13
00:02:27,041 --> 00:02:28,000
[IMANOTSURUGI]
Whoa!

14
00:02:30,375 --> 00:02:31,750
I didn't mean like that!

15
00:02:34,583 --> 00:02:36,291
[IMANOTSURUGI]
Oh, no, I'm sorry!

16
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:39,958
[IMANOTSURUGI]
A weird dream?

17
00:02:40,041 --> 00:02:42,208
[YASUSADA] Yeah, I keep
having it over and over again.

18
00:02:43,291 --> 00:02:44,708
It's the battle
where the Shinsengumi

19
00:02:44,791 --> 00:02:47,083
are storming the Ikedaya Inn.

20
00:02:47,166 --> 00:02:50,208
Souji rushes into battle on
the second floor like normal,

21
00:02:50,291 --> 00:02:52,333
but he has me with him.

22
00:02:52,416 --> 00:02:53,833
[IMANOTSURUGI] But historically,
it's supposed to be

23
00:02:53,916 --> 00:02:55,666
Kashuu, right?

24
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:57,041
Right.

25
00:02:57,125 --> 00:02:59,500
But it still seems so real,
even if I wasn't there.

26
00:02:59,583 --> 00:03:01,333
[laughing]

27
00:03:01,416 --> 00:03:04,375
What's with that
serious face? C'mon!

28
00:03:04,458 --> 00:03:06,000
Ow! Iwatooshi!

29
00:03:06,083 --> 00:03:08,000
[IWATOOSHI] Just remember,
you only get to change history

30
00:03:08,083 --> 00:03:09,291
in your dreams!

31
00:03:09,375 --> 00:03:11,458
[laughing]

32
00:03:11,541 --> 00:03:12,708
If you put it that way,

33
00:03:12,791 --> 00:03:15,833
I have a dream of
my own I can't shake.

34
00:03:15,916 --> 00:03:18,625
Even though I was Lord
Yoshitsune's protector sword...

35
00:03:21,541 --> 00:03:24,541
...I couldn't do
anything to save him.

36
00:03:24,625 --> 00:03:26,958
That's all in the past,
Imanotsurugi.

37
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:28,458
It's time to move on.

38
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:29,833
Yeah.

39
00:03:29,916 --> 00:03:32,416
Now that I'm here
with you, it's okay.

40
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,750
I won't ever let
you feel lonely again.

41
00:03:37,958 --> 00:03:38,750
Hey, guys.

42
00:03:38,833 --> 00:03:40,375
We have a new mission.

43
00:03:40,458 --> 00:03:41,625
Oh, really?

44
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:48,000
[NAKIGITSUNE]
That fried tofu smells great!

45
00:03:48,083 --> 00:03:50,791
Don't be stingy,
Nakigitsune, give me one!

46
00:03:53,125 --> 00:03:54,541
[NAKIGITSUNE]
That's more like it!

47
00:03:54,625 --> 00:03:56,833
[chewing noise]

48
00:03:56,916 --> 00:03:58,041
Since you made so many,

49
00:03:58,125 --> 00:04:00,291
we should share some
with the new recruit.

50
00:04:00,375 --> 00:04:01,875
The other fox guy.

51
00:04:01,958 --> 00:04:03,875
Yeah, that's the idea.

52
00:04:03,958 --> 00:04:05,083
[NAKIGITSUNE]
It's not like you to cook.

53
00:04:05,166 --> 00:04:07,416
You must really wanna
impress this fellow!

54
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,666
Any reason why, Nakigitsune?

55
00:04:10,666 --> 00:04:12,666
We're both foxes,
like you said.

56
00:04:14,166 --> 00:04:15,125
[MIKAZUKI sighs]

57
00:04:16,375 --> 00:04:18,250
Looks like another lovely day.

58
00:04:21,333 --> 00:04:24,000
[MIKAZUKI]
As meticulous as ever, I see.

59
00:04:24,083 --> 00:04:25,583
The master said
they liked my hair,

60
00:04:25,666 --> 00:04:27,416
so I'd better take care of it.

61
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:28,666
[MIKAZUKI]
Ah, I see.

62
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:30,708
Then the comb was
a gift from them.

63
00:04:30,791 --> 00:04:34,208
My hair has gotten so shiny,
it's almost scary.

64
00:04:34,291 --> 00:04:36,041
Well, that is just splendid.

65
00:04:36,125 --> 00:04:37,541
By the way, Mikazuki,

66
00:04:37,625 --> 00:04:40,166
it seems you're quite the
celebrity here at the citadel.

67
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:42,125
All you have to do is
take a seat on the porch

68
00:04:42,208 --> 00:04:44,375
and people line up
to pamper you.

69
00:04:44,458 --> 00:04:47,291
Everyone has been
so terribly kind.

70
00:04:47,375 --> 00:04:49,583
Serving me hot tea...

71
00:04:49,666 --> 00:04:52,000
Massaging my aching back...

72
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:55,541
Covering me with baby tigers
when the weather is cold...

73
00:04:55,625 --> 00:04:56,416
Yes.

74
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,208
I wonder who will stop by next?

75
00:04:59,375 --> 00:05:01,125
I need to have
a cool intro line.

76
00:05:02,333 --> 00:05:05,333
"Like shishito peppers?
You'll love Shishiou!"

77
00:05:07,166 --> 00:05:09,416
What a great and
powerful sword he is!

78
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,166
You know that's not true!

79
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:15,333
My former master was an old man
named Minamoto no Yorimasa.

80
00:05:15,416 --> 00:05:18,125
I was made to be light,
not "great and powerful."

81
00:05:18,208 --> 00:05:20,333
So I'm easy for anyone to wield!

82
00:05:20,416 --> 00:05:21,916
In that case, you might
say you're good at

83
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,791
taking care of the elderly.

84
00:05:23,875 --> 00:05:26,916
[SHISHIOU] If you wanna put it
that way, then... yeah, sure.

85
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,791
[MIKAZUKI laughs]

86
00:05:28,875 --> 00:05:31,750
Well, if you'd like to
take care of me, be my guest.

87
00:05:35,208 --> 00:05:36,208
What's that smell?

88
00:05:36,291 --> 00:05:38,458
It's something delicious, I bet.

89
00:05:38,541 --> 00:05:39,833
[NAKIGITSUNE]
Sorry to interrupt,

90
00:05:39,916 --> 00:05:43,583
but Nakigitsune made
<i>inarizushi</i> for everyone.

91
00:05:43,666 --> 00:05:44,666
Would you like some?

92
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:47,000
[KOGITSUNEMARU]
Oh, that's my favorite!

93
00:05:47,083 --> 00:05:48,875
I didn't know
you liked to cook!

94
00:05:48,958 --> 00:05:50,666
[NAKIGITSUNE] Don't worry,
they're delicious.

95
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:52,166
I promise.

96
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:54,708
[NAKIGITSUNE]
Yep. Delicious.

97
00:05:54,791 --> 00:05:56,625
[MIKAZUKI]
Then allow me to partake.

98
00:05:56,708 --> 00:05:58,250
[KOGITSUNEMARU]
That's the biggest one.

99
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,375
[NAKIGITSUNE]
They're packed with wasabi,

100
00:06:01,458 --> 00:06:03,250
for a more mature flavor.

101
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:05,875
[KOGITSUNEMARU]
Are you all right?

102
00:06:07,958 --> 00:06:10,166
That's a bit too much
spice for this old man.

103
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:11,833
[KOGITSUNEMARU]
You're just exaggerating.

104
00:06:11,916 --> 00:06:13,541
[NAKIGITSUNE]
I thought it was fine.

105
00:06:19,708 --> 00:06:20,833
[NAKIGITSUNE]
Oh, no!

106
00:06:20,916 --> 00:06:22,000
Hang in there, pal!

107
00:06:22,083 --> 00:06:24,083
[laughing]

108
00:06:24,166 --> 00:06:26,208
[MIKAZUKI] Nakigitsune
sure can bring a smile

109
00:06:26,291 --> 00:06:27,750
to an old man's face.

110
00:06:30,291 --> 00:06:32,166
Is something wrong?

111
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:33,916
No, just busy, that's all!

112
00:06:34,791 --> 00:06:35,583
Bye!

113
00:06:35,666 --> 00:06:37,625
[TSURUMARU humming]

114
00:06:41,041 --> 00:06:43,375
[SHISHIOU]
Tsurumaru!

115
00:06:43,458 --> 00:06:45,208
[TSURUMARU] I'm here.
You don't have to yell.

116
00:06:45,291 --> 00:06:47,833
Someone else is as good
with old people as me!

117
00:06:47,916 --> 00:06:49,625
I need your help.

118
00:06:49,708 --> 00:06:51,791
None of that makes any sense.

119
00:06:51,875 --> 00:06:55,041
Hot tea and shoulder massages
are for total amateurs!

120
00:06:55,125 --> 00:06:56,958
What old people really need...

121
00:06:57,041 --> 00:06:58,333
...is a surprise!

122
00:07:00,125 --> 00:07:02,000
[TSURUMARU]
I'm in. Who's the target?

123
00:07:02,083 --> 00:07:04,166
[SHISHIOU]
Mikazuki, obviously!

124
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:05,916
[TSURUMARU] If you want to
prove your worth as a caretaker

125
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,166
to the elderly,
that's certainly the guy.

126
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:11,958
But in what way should we
try to surprise him exactly?

127
00:07:13,125 --> 00:07:17,750
[SHISHIOU] How about...
a Super Sword Warrior?

128
00:07:17,833 --> 00:07:19,125
[TSURUMARU]
He'd be cool and strong,

129
00:07:19,208 --> 00:07:22,000
but nice and friendly, too,
and really stylish.

130
00:07:22,083 --> 00:07:23,958
A Sword Warrior
among Sword Warriors

131
00:07:24,041 --> 00:07:25,583
that could put all
of us to shame!

132
00:07:25,666 --> 00:07:27,333
[SHISHIOU]
The next evolution!

133
00:07:27,416 --> 00:07:28,500
That's right.

134
00:07:28,583 --> 00:07:30,208
And when Mikazuki
gets a good look at him,

135
00:07:30,291 --> 00:07:31,916
it'll blow his mind!

136
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,250
Sounds like a good prank,

137
00:07:33,333 --> 00:07:36,083
but who's gonna be the
Super Sword Warrior?

138
00:07:36,166 --> 00:07:37,666
[TSURUMARU]
You, obviously!

139
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:38,708
Huh?!

140
00:07:40,166 --> 00:07:43,250
I'm gonna go look for
some collaborators.

141
00:07:43,333 --> 00:07:45,833
[laughing]

142
00:07:45,916 --> 00:07:47,500
Well... Okay, then.

143
00:07:52,458 --> 00:07:54,583
[TSURUMARU]
Hachisuka will make your outfit.

144
00:07:54,666 --> 00:07:56,583
Kiyomitsu will do your nails.

145
00:07:56,666 --> 00:07:58,625
And Midare will
teach you etiquette.

146
00:07:58,708 --> 00:08:00,000
Etiquette?

147
00:08:00,083 --> 00:08:02,208
Remind me, why would
I want to engage

148
00:08:02,291 --> 00:08:04,291
in this nonsense with you?

149
00:08:04,375 --> 00:08:06,500
[TSURUMARU] If he's going
to be a Super Sword Warrior,

150
00:08:06,583 --> 00:08:08,666
then he has to
surpass all of us.

151
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:11,166
You're the only one
who has the artistic vision

152
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:14,000
to design a look
fancy enough for that.

153
00:08:14,083 --> 00:08:15,416
I'm doing the nails?

154
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:16,833
[TSURUMARU]
A Super Sword Warrior

155
00:08:16,916 --> 00:08:19,583
should stride into battle,
flashy fingernails first!

156
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:21,708
Otherwise, he's just not super!

157
00:08:21,791 --> 00:08:23,166
That is true.

158
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:24,708
[TSURUMARU] While they're
getting that ready, Midare,

159
00:08:24,791 --> 00:08:26,208
teach him some etiquette.

160
00:08:26,291 --> 00:08:27,875
I don't know what that means.

161
00:08:27,958 --> 00:08:29,208
[TSURUMARU] A Super Sword
Warrior should have

162
00:08:29,291 --> 00:08:31,041
a super unique personality.

163
00:08:31,125 --> 00:08:34,000
You know, some weird modern
slang that nobody else gets.

164
00:08:34,083 --> 00:08:35,583
Teach him something crazy.

165
00:08:35,666 --> 00:08:37,875
Oh, like the stuff in
the master's magazines--

166
00:08:37,958 --> 00:08:39,750
Yeah, I can do that no problem!

167
00:08:39,833 --> 00:08:42,333
I'll do whatever it takes
to surprise Mikazuki!

168
00:08:42,416 --> 00:08:43,666
It won't be easy,

169
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:45,708
but we've assembled the
perfect team for Shishiou!

170
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:49,083
Please, make me more super
than anything you've ever seen!

171
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:53,333
When you put it that way,
it's hard to refuse.

172
00:08:53,416 --> 00:08:54,375
Very well.

173
00:08:54,458 --> 00:08:57,083
Let's usher in a
new era of fashion.

174
00:08:58,250 --> 00:08:59,541
If you're going
to do something,

175
00:08:59,625 --> 00:09:01,000
you have to go all the way.

176
00:09:01,083 --> 00:09:02,666
You're gonna be so cool!

177
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:04,166
[SHISHIOU]
Thanks, guys!

178
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:06,166
[TSURUMARU] All right, let's
go grab everything we need!

179
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,458
[MIDARE]
YOLO.

180
00:09:31,541 --> 00:09:33,250
That's like a
toy thingie, right?

181
00:09:33,333 --> 00:09:34,625
[KASHUU]
You're thinking "yo-yo."

182
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:36,666
This means,
"You only live once."

183
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:38,208
That is correct.

184
00:09:38,291 --> 00:09:39,625
How 'bout "'mirin"?

185
00:09:39,708 --> 00:09:41,000
That's like a headache.

186
00:09:41,083 --> 00:09:42,000
That's a migraine.

187
00:09:42,083 --> 00:09:43,625
You are so bad at this.

188
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:45,333
[MIDARE] Like you're
admirin' someone. Duh.

189
00:09:45,416 --> 00:09:47,750
[SHISHIOU] Okay, then
why don't you just say that?

190
00:09:47,833 --> 00:09:51,083
Because Super Sword Warriors
have gotta be super extreme.

191
00:09:51,166 --> 00:09:53,291
"Hangry" is "so
hungry you're angry."

192
00:09:53,375 --> 00:09:55,916
If you're at a good party,
you say it's "lit."

193
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,666
And when you're happy,
it's "Majirunrun Gokigenmaru"!

194
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:00,750
Uh, what else?

195
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:02,041
[KASHUU]
His nails are done.

196
00:10:03,125 --> 00:10:06,458
I gave them a moon motif,
just like Mikazuki.

197
00:10:06,541 --> 00:10:07,333
Pretty cute, huh?

198
00:10:07,416 --> 00:10:08,541
[SHISHIOU]
Ooh!

199
00:10:09,541 --> 00:10:10,416
[KASHUU]
Do they pass?

200
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,166
I'm 'mirin these nails!

201
00:10:13,875 --> 00:10:15,625
I borrowed clothes
from everyone.

202
00:10:15,708 --> 00:10:19,208
If we put all of them together,
it should be quite impressive!

203
00:10:19,291 --> 00:10:20,583
[SHISHIOU]
It'll be super!

204
00:10:20,666 --> 00:10:22,750
[KASHUU]
Or "extreme," at least.

205
00:10:22,833 --> 00:10:23,916
YOLO, right, guys?

206
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:24,916
Yep!

207
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,291
"Yo... lo"?

208
00:10:27,833 --> 00:10:29,750
[HACHISUKA] Starting with the
feet, the boots are mine,

209
00:10:29,833 --> 00:10:31,833
while the tunic is Horikawa's.

210
00:10:31,916 --> 00:10:34,708
The jacket is from
Kashuu, obviously.

211
00:10:34,791 --> 00:10:36,333
The white cloak is from Nikkari,

212
00:10:36,416 --> 00:10:38,625
with Doudanuki's scarf
and Maeda's hat.

213
00:10:38,708 --> 00:10:40,583
Well, what do you think?

214
00:10:40,666 --> 00:10:41,916
I think you're a genius!

215
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,333
It's just what I wanted.

216
00:10:43,416 --> 00:10:45,083
Cool, but also perplexing!

217
00:10:45,166 --> 00:10:46,416
Exactly!

218
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:47,625
[SHISHIOU]
Think I'm ready?

219
00:10:47,708 --> 00:10:49,625
Well, you certainly
look the part.

220
00:10:49,708 --> 00:10:50,833
But for the surprise to work,

221
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:52,750
your performance
has to be good too.

222
00:10:52,833 --> 00:10:54,166
What did you have in mind?

223
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:59,375
'Kay, you ready, guys?

224
00:11:00,458 --> 00:11:01,666
Shishiou too?

225
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:02,750
[SHISHIOU]
I'm lit!

226
00:11:02,833 --> 00:11:05,250
That's not how you use that.

227
00:11:05,333 --> 00:11:06,875
[TSURUMARU]
Whatever! Let's go!

228
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:09,750
[HACHISUKA]
Wow!

229
00:11:09,833 --> 00:11:11,833
[MIDARE]
Who could that be?

230
00:11:11,916 --> 00:11:13,458
I have never seen
a Sword Warrior

231
00:11:13,541 --> 00:11:15,041
quite like him before!

232
00:11:15,125 --> 00:11:16,083
What's the commotion?

233
00:11:16,166 --> 00:11:17,500
A new recruit?

234
00:11:17,583 --> 00:11:20,250
Yeah, only this guy is
on a totally different level!

235
00:11:20,333 --> 00:11:21,541
What's his name?

236
00:11:21,625 --> 00:11:23,416
Oh, uh, that would be, ah...

237
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,250
"Majirunrun Gokigenmaru"!

238
00:11:25,333 --> 00:11:28,083
Yeah! He's even got "maru"
in his name just like us!

239
00:11:28,166 --> 00:11:30,083
Totally normal, right?

240
00:11:30,166 --> 00:11:33,750
Only he's not like us, 'cause
he's a Super Sword Warrior.

241
00:11:33,833 --> 00:11:35,833
And what is that, exactly?

242
00:11:35,916 --> 00:11:38,666
I suppose we'll just
have to wait and see.

243
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:40,916
Look sharp, men!
He's coming this way!

244
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,250
He's so cool!

245
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
[YAMANBAGIRI yelps]

246
00:12:03,208 --> 00:12:04,166
[SHISHIOU]
NP!

247
00:12:06,875 --> 00:12:08,666
[SHISHIOU]
That's no problem, baby.

248
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:09,708
NP!

249
00:12:09,791 --> 00:12:11,208
Everything is super fly!

250
00:12:12,333 --> 00:12:14,875
His vocabulary is way
more super than ours!

251
00:12:14,958 --> 00:12:17,625
Indeed, I can't understand
a word he's saying.

252
00:12:17,708 --> 00:12:19,125
[SHISHIOU]
Get hangry!

253
00:12:19,208 --> 00:12:20,333
Get what, now?

254
00:12:21,708 --> 00:12:23,875
[SHISHIOU] We did it!
He's totally shocked!

255
00:12:25,375 --> 00:12:27,166
[MIKAZUKI] Goodness,
what a surprise.

256
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:30,041
Our good friend Shishito seems
to have transformed himself

257
00:12:30,125 --> 00:12:31,791
into a Super Sword Warrior.

258
00:12:31,875 --> 00:12:32,875
[SHISHIOU yells]

259
00:12:33,333 --> 00:12:35,583
It's Shishiou!
"Shishito" is a pepper!

260
00:12:35,666 --> 00:12:37,541
[MIKAZUKI laughs]

261
00:12:37,625 --> 00:12:41,166
You put together this act
just to amuse me, didn't you?

262
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:43,625
Heh. When it comes to
caring for the elderly,

263
00:12:43,708 --> 00:12:45,583
you really are top notch.

264
00:12:45,666 --> 00:12:49,250
[MIKAZUKI laughing]

265
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:52,833
So, mission accomplished?

266
00:12:52,916 --> 00:12:54,458
Yeah. Obviously.

267
00:12:54,541 --> 00:12:57,875
[ALL laughing]

268
00:13:00,916 --> 00:13:02,291
NP.

269
00:13:09,208 --> 00:13:10,833
Wow, what happened to your head?

270
00:13:10,916 --> 00:13:13,291
[ISHIKIRIMARU]
Are you all right?

271
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:14,708
NP.

272
00:13:14,791 --> 00:13:15,875
[ISHIKIRIMARU, YASUSADA]
NP?

273
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:17,291
Ka ka ka!

274
00:13:17,375 --> 00:13:20,916
My brethren, it seems the
time of battle is upon us!

275
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,208
Glad someone's
excited, at least.

276
00:13:23,291 --> 00:13:25,583
If one can meet
any hardship with a smile,

277
00:13:25,666 --> 00:13:27,958
that is the sign
of true strength.

278
00:13:28,041 --> 00:13:29,666
[YAMANBAGIRI] And what
good is "true strength"?

279
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:32,500
Well, it could put an
end to this war, for one.

280
00:13:32,583 --> 00:13:35,416
Then perhaps I can be a
proper work of art once more.

281
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:37,333
Like that'll happen.

282
00:13:37,416 --> 00:13:39,875
Sorry to keep you waiting, guys.

283
00:13:39,958 --> 00:13:41,958
I got our new dispatch
orders from the master,

284
00:13:42,041 --> 00:13:43,833
so I'm gonna read them now.

285
00:13:43,916 --> 00:13:45,625
The team is as follows:

286
00:13:45,708 --> 00:13:50,583
Yamatonokami Yasusada,
Imanotsurugi, Iwatooshi,

287
00:13:50,666 --> 00:13:54,166
Ishkirimaru, and
Yamanbagiri Kunihiro.

288
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:56,875
Yamabushi Kunihiro
will serve as captain.

289
00:13:56,958 --> 00:13:58,500
[YAMABUSHI]
Ka ka ka!

290
00:13:58,583 --> 00:14:00,750
I will strive to be
a worthy guide!

291
00:14:00,833 --> 00:14:03,250
This shall strengthen
my leadership muscles.

292
00:14:03,333 --> 00:14:05,208
I know all of you are
from different times,

293
00:14:05,291 --> 00:14:07,083
but do your best to work
together and come back

294
00:14:07,166 --> 00:14:08,958
in one piece.

295
00:14:09,041 --> 00:14:11,666
Your destination
is the year 1189.

296
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:12,875
Atsukashiyama.

297
00:14:12,958 --> 00:14:14,666
Atsukashiyama?

298
00:14:16,708 --> 00:14:18,208
We're unsure if
the enemy's strong.

299
00:14:18,291 --> 00:14:20,250
But regardless of history,
we will discover

300
00:14:20,333 --> 00:14:21,625
their true objective.

301
00:14:21,708 --> 00:14:23,625
This is my first
time going there.

302
00:14:23,708 --> 00:14:25,250
So I'm not really sure.

303
00:14:25,333 --> 00:14:26,500
[HORIKAWA]
According to Konnosuke,

304
00:14:26,583 --> 00:14:28,916
the enemy has substantial
fighting ability.

305
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,583
The Master said Yasusada's
skill will be key.

306
00:14:31,666 --> 00:14:34,875
Also, they expect great
things from Imanotsurugi,

307
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:37,208
so best of luck
to both of you.

308
00:14:37,291 --> 00:14:38,458
We got this.

309
00:14:40,666 --> 00:14:42,208
Departure is in thirty minutes.

310
00:14:42,291 --> 00:14:45,333
Make your preparations,
then return here.

311
00:14:45,416 --> 00:14:46,958
I'm sure this goes
without saying,

312
00:14:47,041 --> 00:14:49,625
but be prepared for
any possibility out there.

313
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:53,541
[HASEBE]
Have a second?

314
00:14:53,625 --> 00:14:55,125
Yeah, what's up?

315
00:14:55,208 --> 00:14:56,625
Before you deploy,

316
00:14:56,708 --> 00:14:59,416
there's something that you
should know about this battle.

317
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:03,166
It involves Imanotsurugi's
former master, Yoshitsune.

318
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:06,458
He was at war with his brother,
whose name was Yoritomo.

319
00:15:06,541 --> 00:15:08,583
Yoshitsune was aided
by the Fujiwara,

320
00:15:08,666 --> 00:15:11,291
but they could not halt
Yoritomo's advance.

321
00:15:11,375 --> 00:15:12,666
Rather than surrender,

322
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:16,125
Yoshitsune killed his family
and committed seppuku.

323
00:15:16,208 --> 00:15:19,833
Needless to say, this battle may
be difficult for Imanotsurugi.

324
00:15:19,916 --> 00:15:22,791
That's why he looked
so upset back there.

325
00:15:22,875 --> 00:15:25,916
But why would the master
make him go through with this?

326
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,750
It's only going to bring back
painful memories, isn't it?

327
00:15:29,833 --> 00:15:32,833
[HASEBE] The master has their
own way of doing things.

328
00:15:32,916 --> 00:15:36,166
You were sent to the Ikedaya Inn
on your first mission, remember?

329
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:38,625
Souza and I were sent
to Honnouji as well.

330
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,500
So they think
we'll grow stronger

331
00:15:41,583 --> 00:15:44,333
if we're forced to
confront our own history?

332
00:15:44,416 --> 00:15:45,458
[HASEBE]
Who knows?

333
00:15:45,541 --> 00:15:46,875
It's the master.

334
00:15:46,958 --> 00:15:48,833
I gave up trying to figure
out how their brain works

335
00:15:48,916 --> 00:15:51,000
a long time ago.

336
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:53,791
[YASUSADA] I guess they've never
lead us wrong before, have they?

337
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:00,166
Looking great, guys.

338
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:02,083
Give it your best
out there, okay?

339
00:16:02,166 --> 00:16:03,083
[YAMABUSHI]
Right!

340
00:16:03,166 --> 00:16:04,875
I kinda wish
I could tag along.

341
00:16:04,958 --> 00:16:07,083
It'll be over soon, anyway.

342
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:08,291
Battle is training!

343
00:16:08,375 --> 00:16:09,750
Life is training!

344
00:16:09,833 --> 00:16:11,458
Let's grow stronger together!

345
00:16:12,291 --> 00:16:13,416
Come back safe!

346
00:16:20,833 --> 00:16:23,041
So this is Atsukashiyama.

347
00:16:23,125 --> 00:16:24,750
Let's settle this
before Yoritomo

348
00:16:24,833 --> 00:16:27,541
and the Fujiwara armies show up.

349
00:16:27,625 --> 00:16:30,708
We can't do anything
until the enemy gets here.

350
00:16:30,791 --> 00:16:32,791
Yoritomo...
if it wasn't for him,

351
00:16:32,875 --> 00:16:35,500
my master wouldn't have
suffered such a terrible death.

352
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:36,625
I know.

353
00:16:37,791 --> 00:16:39,750
Keep your head up, Imanotsurugi.

354
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:42,208
We're all going
to need your help.

355
00:16:42,291 --> 00:16:45,375
You can't allow yourself to
be trapped in the past, friend.

356
00:16:45,458 --> 00:16:46,750
Yes!

357
00:16:46,833 --> 00:16:48,291
Let us forge a path through
these troubled memories

358
00:16:48,375 --> 00:16:49,916
that leads to a bright future!

359
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,458
That aside, I'm itching
for a good fight.

360
00:16:53,541 --> 00:16:55,541
And our enemies are, too.

361
00:16:55,625 --> 00:16:58,583
I can feel their
bloodlust closing in.

362
00:16:58,666 --> 00:16:59,958
Me too.

363
00:17:00,041 --> 00:17:01,083
You ready?

364
00:17:04,833 --> 00:17:06,041
Ambush!

365
00:17:09,416 --> 00:17:10,875
Did you get hit?

366
00:17:10,958 --> 00:17:12,041
[YASUSADA]
This is no good!

367

He's breaking down.

368
00:17:13,291 --> 00:17:15,708
Take care of
the rear, Iwatooshi!

369
00:17:15,791 --> 00:17:18,791
Give Imanotsurugi whatever
support he requires!

370
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:23,625
There's so many
different kinds this time!

371
00:17:23,708 --> 00:17:25,208
No matter what
type of enemy,

372
00:17:25,291 --> 00:17:27,166
have faith that our
skill will triumph!

373
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:28,875
Focus, then strike them down!

374
00:17:28,958 --> 00:17:29,958
Got it.

375
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:31,458
[YAMANBAGIRI]
Moving in.

376
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:35,000
Time for battle!

377
00:17:35,083 --> 00:17:36,416

My roaring muscles will
deliver you straight to hell!

I love a good hunt!

382
00:17:45,625 --> 00:17:48,166
If I can hurry up and
finish off the enemies here,

383
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:50,708
I might have to time
to save Yoshitsune's life.

384
00:17:50,791 --> 00:17:51,875
[IWATOOSHI]
Don't you dare!

385
00:17:53,166 --> 00:17:55,208
If I have the power to
stop them, why can't I?

386
00:17:55,291 --> 00:17:57,166
All this suffering
is in the past!

387
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:59,625
Whatever happens,
we will still march forward!

388

I know, but...

389
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:05,166
[YASUSADA] I understand how
you feel, Imanotsurugi.

390
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:06,791
I went through the same thing.

391
00:18:09,125 --> 00:18:11,333
[YASUSADA]
I wanted to protect Souji.

392
00:18:11,416 --> 00:18:13,541
Wasn't that my purpose,
after all?

393
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:15,541
For months, he was
all I could think of.

394
00:18:15,625 --> 00:18:18,625
I was focused on that one
event, so far in the past.

395
00:18:19,541 --> 00:18:21,125
But that's not right.

396
00:18:21,208 --> 00:18:23,083
Because even if it's tragic,

397
00:18:23,166 --> 00:18:26,083
that past is the reason I'm
able to fight, here and now.

398

Imanotsurugi,

regardless of how
you feel about him,

Yoshitsune isn't the one
wielding you anymore--

As long as your memories
are chaining you down,

408
00:18:47,666 --> 00:18:50,000
you won't be able to fight.

409

Break those chains
and fight with your friends.

With my friends.

Because you've said it
like, a million times!

Does that mean I can't move on

I can hardly imagine it!

452
00:21:17,416 --> 00:21:19,250
