I thought that was a real bird!

16
00:02:51,083 --> 00:02:52,750
[UGUISUMARU] I was trying
to call a nightingale,

17
00:02:52,833 --> 00:02:55,125
but it seems I
called you instead.

18
00:02:55,208 --> 00:02:57,458
[HASEBE] I was trying to catch
a nightingale for the master,

19
00:02:57,541 --> 00:03:01,125
but I caught you instead,
so thanks, Uguisumaru.

20
00:03:01,208 --> 00:03:03,583
Does that mean I have
to be the master's pet?

Hmph. I would
need a bigger cage.

On an unrelated note,

that tree paints
quite the picture.

Do you know what it's called?

[HASEBE] You mean what
kind of tree is it? Hm...

26
00:03:16,291 --> 00:03:17,916
[UGUISUMARU]
It must be quite rare if even

27
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,500
an old sword like me
hasn't seen one before.

28
00:03:20,583 --> 00:03:21,666
How peculiar.

29
00:03:22,541 --> 00:03:24,208
What are they
looking for out there?

There's nothing.

[HIRANO]
I found one!

[MAEDA]
So they are real!

33
00:03:29,583 --> 00:03:30,541
Of course!

34
00:03:30,625 --> 00:03:32,541
The master was
the one who told me.

35
00:03:32,625 --> 00:03:34,083
It's the first I've ever seen.

36
00:03:34,166 --> 00:03:35,750
They are pretty rare.

37
00:03:35,833 --> 00:03:38,625
I think they're only
one in ten thousand,

38
00:03:38,708 --> 00:03:41,208
so you could look all
day and not find one.

39

They say they're good luck.

40

Wouldn't hurt to keep one
around in case that's true.

Wow.

[HIRANO] I was thinking of
giving it to Uguisumaru.

43

I'm sure he'd be happy,

44
00:03:51,416 --> 00:03:53,541
but does he actually
need any good luck?

45
00:03:53,625 --> 00:03:55,083
I've been too nervous
to talk to him,

46
00:03:55,166 --> 00:03:57,083

for a good excuse.

Is something wrong?

Then the lid came
off my spice jar

That does sound
rather unfortunate.

I was going to give
this to someone else,

you need it more.

What, a flower?

Consider it a good luck charm.

64
00:04:32,291 --> 00:04:33,875
So do I, like, eat it?

00:04:33,958 --> 00:04:35,333
How does this work?

No, offense,

161
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:53,625
He thought if I put it on,

162
00:08:53,708 --> 00:08:55,708
he could steal my
cloak and clean it.

163
00:08:55,791 --> 00:08:58,875
He should've known better; that
thing is way too fancy for me.

164
00:08:58,958 --> 00:09:00,041
You take it.

165
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:01,750
[HIRANO]
Thanks!

166
00:09:10,208 --> 00:09:13,041
[NIKKARI] That cloak you've
got looks nice and warm.

167
00:09:13,125 --> 00:09:15,041
Are you saying
you're cold, Nikkari?

168
00:09:15,125 --> 00:09:16,416
[chuckles]

169
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:19,708
[NIKKARI] That cloak you've
got looks nice and warm.

170
00:09:19,791 --> 00:09:22,375
[HIRANO] Wow, not being
very subtle is he.

171
00:09:24,833 --> 00:09:26,625
Oh, wait. Here.

172
00:09:26,708 --> 00:09:28,625
Why don't you
take this in return?

173
00:09:28,708 --> 00:09:30,250
Okay, but what is it?

174
00:09:30,333 --> 00:09:32,125
[NIKKARI] A beloved companion
to embrace at night,

175
00:09:32,208 --> 00:09:33,958
healing your worries and
giving you the comfort

176
00:09:34,041 --> 00:09:35,958
of a mother and lover alike.

177
00:09:36,041 --> 00:09:38,250
It's a body pillow.
You've never heard of them?

178
00:09:38,333 --> 00:09:40,208
I've got this lovely
gold ball, too,

179
00:09:40,291 --> 00:09:42,458
but I won't let anyone
else touch it.

180
00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:45,375
Can you please just
call it gold armor?

181
00:09:45,458 --> 00:09:47,166
I can feel your warmth.

182
00:09:52,875 --> 00:09:54,250
What's that?

183
00:09:54,333 --> 00:09:56,500
[HIRANO] Oh, uh...
It's a body pillow.

184
00:09:56,583 --> 00:09:59,291
I don't really have
any need for it, though.

185
00:09:59,375 --> 00:10:00,875
[SAYO]
Big brother.

186
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:02,166
[SOUZA]
Do you like it?

187
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:03,916
Other brother.

188
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,541
Do you mind giving
him this, Hirano?

189
00:10:05,625 --> 00:10:08,750
It seems that it reminds him
of our brother from long ago.

190
00:10:08,833 --> 00:10:10,208
Fine with me.

191
00:10:10,291 --> 00:10:11,583
[SOUZA]
Here, let's trade.

192
00:10:11,666 --> 00:10:14,000
This is the key to an
old playmate of mine.

193
00:10:15,708 --> 00:10:17,375
Thank you, I think.

194
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,541
I'm clearly a
national treasure.

195
00:10:26,625 --> 00:10:29,291
How could they put someone
like me on field duty?

196
00:10:29,375 --> 00:10:30,375
It's awful.

197
00:10:32,291 --> 00:10:34,625
[HIRANO]
Um, is this it?

198
00:10:34,708 --> 00:10:36,166
[HACHISUKA]
Hirano!

199
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:38,166
Please tell me you've come to
save me from this drudgery!

200
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:39,583
[HIRANO]
Oh, hi, Hachisuka.

201
00:10:39,666 --> 00:10:42,375
Souza gave me the key to this,
whatever it is.

202
00:10:45,541 --> 00:10:47,875
That machine's a
little big for you.

203
00:10:47,958 --> 00:10:51,000
Perhaps you should let me
take it for a spin instead.

204
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:55,958
[HACHISUKA laughing]

205
00:10:57,125 --> 00:10:59,708
[HACHISUKA] There. Now that
is much more glamorous.

206
00:10:59,791 --> 00:11:01,708
I daresay that was even fun.

207
00:11:01,791 --> 00:11:02,958
If you would
let me have this,

208
00:11:03,041 --> 00:11:04,791
I would be deeply
indebted to you.

209
00:11:04,875 --> 00:11:08,083
If it means that much to you,
then sure, you can have it.

210
00:11:08,166 --> 00:11:09,583
Please, take this.

211
00:11:09,666 --> 00:11:13,208
It's nothing fancy, but I assure
you, it's quite delicious.

212
00:11:20,875 --> 00:11:22,458
Uguisumaru.

213
00:11:22,541 --> 00:11:23,791
[UGUISUMARU]
Hello, Hirano.

214
00:11:25,458 --> 00:11:27,708
[HIRANO] Here. Some cake
to have with your tea.

215
00:11:30,291 --> 00:11:32,500
How very thoughtful of you.

216
00:11:32,583 --> 00:11:35,958
These were originally
from Portugal, I believe.

217
00:11:36,041 --> 00:11:37,083
[HIRANO]
Oh...!

218
00:11:37,166 --> 00:11:39,333
I spy some <i>castella</i> !

219
00:11:39,416 --> 00:11:41,583
I've never actually
had <i>castella</i> before,

220
00:11:41,666 --> 00:11:44,125
but I feel as if we were
brought together by fate!

221
00:11:44,208 --> 00:11:46,333
I'm sure he wouldn't
mind sharing with you.

222
00:11:51,541 --> 00:11:53,541
[MUTSUNOKAMI] This is western
civilization's greatest

223
00:11:53,625 --> 00:11:55,250
contribution to Japan!

224
00:11:56,833 --> 00:11:59,500
I'm truly enlightened! Yes!

225
00:12:01,041 --> 00:12:02,583
And you know what else
came from the west?

226
00:12:02,666 --> 00:12:05,583
Photography! So let's
commemorate this with a picture!

227
00:12:05,666 --> 00:12:07,625
[HIRANO] Ah! What are
you doing to my face?!

228
00:12:07,708 --> 00:12:08,750
[MUTSUNOKAMI]
Just one sec.

229
00:12:08,833 --> 00:12:10,708
Faces show up
better with this stuff.

230
00:12:11,958 --> 00:12:14,541
Okay, now eat cake
and look happy!

231
00:12:17,916 --> 00:12:19,041
Is this good?

232
00:12:19,125 --> 00:12:21,833
[MUTSUNOKAMI]
Yeah. Now freeze and smile!

233
00:12:21,916 --> 00:12:24,708
Can I have a little
sip of tea, at least?

234
00:12:24,791 --> 00:12:26,000
[MUTSUNOKAMI] That'll
make the picture blurry.

235
00:12:26,083 --> 00:12:27,875
Just, uh, a little bit longer.

236
00:12:27,958 --> 00:12:30,125
[UGUISUMARU, HIRANO laugh]

237
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:32,625
[HIRANO] It was kind of
a long road to get here,

238
00:12:32,708 --> 00:12:35,458
but taking a photo with
both of us smiling together

239
00:12:35,541 --> 00:12:37,916
is worth a thousand
four leaf clovers.

240
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,625
Sometimes, things just work out.

241
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:46,916
[UGUISUMARU]
Can we move now? Please?

242
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,500
[MUTSUNOKAMI]
No. Stop talking.

243
00:13:05,666 --> 00:13:07,166
[KASHUU]
Ugh, I'm exhausted.

244
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:08,375
[YASUSADA]
Good job, though.

245
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:10,750
Something going on?

246
00:13:10,833 --> 00:13:12,166
Just tigers.

247
00:13:14,458 --> 00:13:16,666
[YAGEN] I wish Ichi was
here to share this with us,

248
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:19,208
to see how happy everyone is.

249
00:13:19,291 --> 00:13:20,625
[YASUSADA]
Who is Ichi?

250
00:13:20,708 --> 00:13:23,416
Ichigo Hitofuri. Yagen and
the others' older brother.

251
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,791
Sayo seems to be
having fun, too.

252
00:13:25,875 --> 00:13:28,375
Our brother Kousetsu would be
pleased to see his smile,

253
00:13:28,458 --> 00:13:29,750
I'm sure.

254
00:13:29,833 --> 00:13:32,333
For the record, Souza
has an older brother,

255
00:13:32,416 --> 00:13:33,958
but he doesn't talk
about him very much.

256
00:13:34,041 --> 00:13:35,500
Is there a reason?

257
00:13:35,583 --> 00:13:37,333
Because Sayo misses him.

258
00:13:37,416 --> 00:13:40,833
And they don't know if and when
they'll ever see him again.

259
00:13:40,916 --> 00:13:42,958
We don't know who will
make it here, after all.

260
00:13:45,833 --> 00:13:46,958
[HASEBE]
Can you spare a minute?

261
00:13:47,041 --> 00:13:48,458
I have a question for you.

262
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:52,125
Does anyone here know
what kind of tree this is?

263
00:13:52,208 --> 00:13:53,375
[KASHUU]
Uh...

264
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:55,083
[HASEBE] Kashuu, you've
been around the longest.

265
00:13:55,166 --> 00:13:56,833
I pride myself
on being informative,

266
00:13:56,916 --> 00:14:00,000
but you probably know things
about the citadel that I don't.

267
00:14:00,083 --> 00:14:01,333
Not about trees.

268
00:14:01,416 --> 00:14:03,708
And I've barely
been here a year.

269
00:14:03,791 --> 00:14:05,916
Uguisumaru asked me earlier.

270
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,875
It's been bugging me all day.

271
00:14:07,958 --> 00:14:09,750
I know it's not a zelkova.

272
00:14:09,833 --> 00:14:11,791
Not a hackberry tree, either.

273
00:14:11,875 --> 00:14:15,250
And if it was a cherry tree,
wouldn't it be blooming by now?

274
00:14:15,333 --> 00:14:16,458
Aww...

275
00:14:16,541 --> 00:14:18,083
I was looking forward
to cherry blossoms!

276
00:14:18,166 --> 00:14:19,625
[HASEBE]
Can't help you there.

277
00:14:19,708 --> 00:14:21,458
So it's not a cherry tree, huh?

278
00:14:21,541 --> 00:14:22,875
Well, that's a letdown.

279
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:24,750
I'm so sad now.

280
00:14:24,833 --> 00:14:27,041
You guys really
like cherry trees.

281
00:14:29,416 --> 00:14:32,583
[HASEBE] As soon as its leaves
come in, we'll have our answer.

282
00:14:32,666 --> 00:14:34,333
I feel like I'm the
bearer of bad news,

283
00:14:34,416 --> 00:14:37,875
but it's not looking good
for Team Cherry Tree.

284
00:14:37,958 --> 00:14:39,166
I won't give up hope.

285
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:41,833
Yeah. It sure would
be nice, huh?

286
00:14:41,916 --> 00:14:44,291
I agree! That's just
what this place needs.

287
00:14:44,375 --> 00:14:45,625
Cherry tree.

288
00:14:47,166 --> 00:14:50,166
There's not some way to make
it a cherry tree, is there?

289
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:51,708
Would you stop being ridiculous?

290
00:14:51,791 --> 00:14:53,291
You know better than that.

291
00:14:53,375 --> 00:14:55,375
Wasn't there a fairy
tale about an old man

292
00:14:55,458 --> 00:14:58,666
that made trees bloom with
the ashes of his magic dog?

293
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:00,250
I've heard of that.

294
00:15:00,333 --> 00:15:01,541
Oh, yeah!

295
00:15:01,625 --> 00:15:02,958
Oh.

296
00:15:03,041 --> 00:15:04,666
Would you get your
head out of the clouds?

297
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:06,833
That story is absolute nonsense.

298
00:15:06,916 --> 00:15:08,875
It'll be fine;
we'll figure something out.

299
00:15:08,958 --> 00:15:10,500
I doubt that!

300
00:15:10,583 --> 00:15:12,833
What if we tried
hypnotizing the tree?

301
00:15:14,791 --> 00:15:16,625
[HONEBAMI]
You are a cherry tree.

302
00:15:18,041 --> 00:15:21,916
You are a cherry tree.
You are a cherry tree.

303
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,916
I-I am a cherry tree...

304
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,791
[HASEBE] This is getting
disturbing! Stop it!

305
00:15:25,875 --> 00:15:28,833
There is one option left,
but it isn't a pretty one.

306
00:15:28,916 --> 00:15:29,958
What is it?

307
00:15:34,125 --> 00:15:36,291
[SOUZA] I once heard
that beautiful cherry trees

308
00:15:36,375 --> 00:15:39,333
often have corpses
buried beneath their roots.

309
00:15:39,416 --> 00:15:40,500
[ALL]
Huh?

310
00:15:40,583 --> 00:15:42,541
So if we could produce
one such corpse...

311
00:15:42,625 --> 00:15:44,041
[ALL]
No, no, no.

312
00:15:44,125 --> 00:15:46,333
[HASEBE] That's far too
morbid, and you know it!

313
00:15:46,416 --> 00:15:47,791
That's so cool.

314
00:15:47,875 --> 00:15:49,708
What if, instead
of killing someone,

315
00:15:49,791 --> 00:15:52,416
we make a wish on
the tree itself?

316
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:55,333
[KASHUU]
I'm afraid I don't follow.

317
00:15:55,416 --> 00:15:56,750
You all have one?

318
00:15:56,833 --> 00:15:58,625
[ALL]
Uh, yes?

319
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:00,458
So, what are we
doing with these?

320
00:16:00,541 --> 00:16:02,250
If we want cherry
blossoms to bloom,

321
00:16:02,333 --> 00:16:04,125
we should write that on
these papers and hang them

322
00:16:04,208 --> 00:16:05,500
on the branches of the tree.

323
00:16:05,583 --> 00:16:07,916
[HASEBE] Ha! And what's that
supposed to accomplish?

324
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,916
If enough people wish
for the same thing,

325
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,625
then maybe the tree can
make a miracle happen.

326
00:16:12,708 --> 00:16:13,875
The tree is fine.

327
00:16:13,958 --> 00:16:16,291
Can we stop it with
the fairy tales already?

328
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:17,708
Oh, I don't know.

329
00:16:17,791 --> 00:16:19,541
It wouldn't hurt
to try, at least.

330
00:16:19,625 --> 00:16:21,916
I have heard that if you put
your feelings into writing,

331
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,416
it can make a wish come true.

332
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:24,666
You think so?

333
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:26,666
You're just making this
stuff up, aren't you?

334
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:28,166
It's worth a shot!

335
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:30,291
If we each place all of our
wishes directly on the tree,

336
00:16:30,375 --> 00:16:31,375
it just might work!

337
00:16:31,458 --> 00:16:32,500
Probably.

338
00:16:32,583 --> 00:16:34,458
[ATSUSHI]
We won't know till we try!

339
00:16:34,541 --> 00:16:37,250
[GOKOTAI] So, is that
like wishing on a star?

340
00:16:37,333 --> 00:16:38,958
[MAEDA]
We're making it up as we go.

341
00:16:39,041 --> 00:16:40,458
Great!

342
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:42,250
We'll write so many that we'll
cover the tree in wishes.

343
00:16:42,333 --> 00:16:44,041
That sounds like a plan to me.

344
00:16:45,375 --> 00:16:47,375
Ugh. I give up.

345
00:16:47,458 --> 00:16:48,916
Okay!

346
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,666
If we're all in agreement, I'll
go get the writing supplies.

347
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:52,375
We'll do a hundred papers each!

348
00:16:52,458 --> 00:16:53,625
[ALL]
A hundred?

349
00:16:53,708 --> 00:16:55,416
[YASUSADA] The more wishes
the better, right?

350
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,458
[ALL chattering]

351
00:16:59,666 --> 00:17:01,166
[KASHUU]
'Kay! Better get writing.

352
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:03,083
[YAGEN] I hope you're
ready to bloom, tree!

353
00:17:03,166 --> 00:17:07,166
[NAMAZUO] I wish that cherry
blossoms would bloom on you.

354
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:08,750
"Blossoms, please."

355
00:17:08,833 --> 00:17:10,541
"A whole bunch of them, please."

356
00:17:12,166 --> 00:17:14,291
Okay. That's three down!

357
00:17:14,375 --> 00:17:18,166
[GOKOTAI]
Uh, me too! Almost done.

358
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:19,500
[AKITA]
Yamatonokami!

359
00:17:19,583 --> 00:17:20,958
More paper, please!

360
00:17:21,041 --> 00:17:22,375
[YASUSADA]
You got it!

361
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:25,166
I wish cherry blossoms
would bloom on your branches.

362
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:26,333
And soon.

363
00:17:26,416 --> 00:17:27,666
[UGUISUMARU chuckles]

364
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:29,958
This is sort of fun, isn't it?

365
00:17:30,041 --> 00:17:32,291
[YAGEN] Hey, look!
I drew a picture on mine.

366
00:17:32,375 --> 00:17:34,875
How did they rope
me into this mess?

367
00:17:36,166 --> 00:17:37,416
[YASUSADA]
Here's some more, Hasebe.

368
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,125
We're counting on you!

369
00:17:39,208 --> 00:17:40,583
Keep up the
good work, you guys.

370
00:17:40,666 --> 00:17:42,000
We've gotta do a thousand each!

371
00:17:42,083 --> 00:17:43,416
[ALL]
A thousand each?

372
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,166
[NAMAZUO yawns]
I'm beat.

373
00:17:48,541 --> 00:17:50,208
[HONEBAMI]
I can't feel my hand.

374
00:17:50,291 --> 00:17:52,166
[NAMAZUO]
Wait, that's not about the tree.

375
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:53,375
[ATSUSHI]
Hey, don't look!

376
00:18:50,666 --> 00:18:52,208
In full bloom already.

377
00:18:52,291 --> 00:18:53,541
So pretty.

378
00:18:53,625 --> 00:18:55,375
It was worth the effort.

379
00:18:56,708 --> 00:18:58,708
So that was your plan.

380
00:18:58,791 --> 00:19:00,166
The backside of
the paper is pink,

381
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:01,916
so it looks like
cherry blossoms.

382
00:19:38,791 --> 00:19:40,916
[chuckles]
They worked hard.

383
00:20:02,916 --> 00:20:05,291
I have heard that if you put
your feelings into writing,

384
00:20:05,375 --> 00:20:06,833
it can make a wish come true.

385
00:20:06,916 --> 00:20:07,958
You think so?

386
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:20,333
[YASUSADA] All these wishes,
like shining petals.

387
00:20:22,708 --> 00:20:24,083
Everyone's dreams.

388
00:20:28,291 --> 00:20:30,208
Wait, is that... a bud?

389
00:20:32,375 --> 00:20:34,333
They're... real!

390
00:20:34,416 --> 00:20:36,250
Real cherry blossoms!

391
00:20:36,333 --> 00:20:36,916
[ALL]
Hm?

392
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,125
What? Really?

393
00:20:42,583 --> 00:20:44,833
He's right! They're real!

394
00:20:44,916 --> 00:20:46,916
Guys. They're everywhere!

395
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,458
They weren't here
just a second ago.

396
00:20:49,541 --> 00:20:52,041
Huh... Guess wishes
do come true!

397
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:54,541
Oh, my, we actually
managed to wish the tree

398
00:20:54,625 --> 00:20:56,000
into blooming somehow?

399
00:20:56,083 --> 00:20:57,583
Yeah.

400
00:20:57,666 --> 00:21:00,375
I-I-I have to tell
the master right now!

401
00:21:01,291 --> 00:21:03,083
[HASEBE]
Master!

402
00:21:10,708 --> 00:21:12,291
Someone once said to me,

403
00:21:12,375 --> 00:21:14,666
"If you ever find a tree
you've never seen before,

404
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:17,000
it might be a ten thousand
leaf cherry tree."

405
00:21:17,083 --> 00:21:18,791
[DOUDANUKI]
Yeah? What does that mean?

406
00:21:18,875 --> 00:21:21,041
It's a miraculous
tree that only blooms

407
00:21:21,125 --> 00:21:23,125
every ten thousand years.

408
00:21:23,208 --> 00:21:25,208
And those who see its blossoms

409
00:21:25,291 --> 00:21:27,166
will have their wishes granted.

410
00:21:30,416 --> 00:21:32,291
[DOUDANUKI]
Don't see that every day, huh?

411
00:22:09,333 --> 00:22:12,958
[YASUSADA] I don't know if this
tree really is magic or not,

412
00:22:13,041 --> 00:22:16,041
but it sure would be nice if
everyone's wishes came true.

413
00:22:20,458 --> 00:22:21,666
[YASUSADA]
Including mine.

414
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:32,041
[YASUSADA] Until then, all I can
do is keep getting stronger.
