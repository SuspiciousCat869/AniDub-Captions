[RUBBER DUCK quacks]

161
00:07:19,416 --> 00:07:22,250
[IMANOTSURUGI]
Yep. That is pretty weird.

162
00:07:22,333 --> 00:07:24,041
All right. So now what?

163
00:07:24,125 --> 00:07:26,666
I have a feeling this
isn't just some prank.

164
00:07:28,125 --> 00:07:30,000
[ISHIKIRIMARU]
What do you think?

165
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:33,416
Frankly, I fear this means that
something has gone amiss

166
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:34,833
at the Ikedaya Inn.

167
00:07:34,916 --> 00:07:37,541
Could you be more
specific, perhaps?

168
00:07:37,625 --> 00:07:40,166
[MIKAZUKI] I believe it may
be the result of Yamatonokami

169
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:43,041
altering history in some way.

170
00:07:43,125 --> 00:07:45,208
Do you think he
did it on purpose?

171
00:07:45,291 --> 00:07:46,583
Then what would happen?

172
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:48,166
To begin,
a powerful new enemy

173
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:50,625
would be drawn into the battle.

174
00:07:50,708 --> 00:07:53,125
One I fear they may
be unable to defeat.

175
00:07:54,208 --> 00:07:55,958
You think he's already lost?

176
00:07:56,916 --> 00:07:58,916
I wouldn't believe
that for an instant.

177
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,208
The bond of the Shinsengumi
swords will carry them

178
00:08:01,291 --> 00:08:02,208
through any trial.

179
00:08:02,291 --> 00:08:03,958
And besides,
whatever goes wrong,

180
00:08:04,041 --> 00:08:05,750
I know Kashuu can fix it.

181
00:08:05,833 --> 00:08:07,125
Yeah, you're right.

182
00:08:07,208 --> 00:08:09,416
He's gotten through every
other mission just fine.

183
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:10,625
And in his case,

184
00:08:10,708 --> 00:08:12,416
that makes for quite
a number of missions.

185
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:15,083
He has been at the citadel
the longest, after all.

Yep!

If I get any more sentimental,
it wouldn't be cool.

Where to?

And when will you come back?

00:18:16,458 --> 00:18:17,875
[KASHUU]
I see.

318
00:18:17,958 --> 00:18:21,125
So I'll have to wait
on you again, it seems.

319
00:18:21,208 --> 00:18:23,375
I wonder if this is what
the master had in mind

when they sent you
to the Ikedaya Inn.

321
00:18:26,333 --> 00:18:28,541
You said you wanted
to become stronger, right?

322
00:18:29,833 --> 00:18:32,500
Well get as strong as you like
and come back when you're done.

323
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:48,541
When it comes to elegance,
there is no finer specimen.

324
00:18:48,625 --> 00:18:50,708
I admit, it is nice.

325
00:18:50,791 --> 00:18:53,291
I thought this was a ten
thousand leaf cherry tree.

326
00:18:53,375 --> 00:18:55,208
But I think I might've
been mistaken.

327
00:18:55,291 --> 00:18:56,625
Well, think...

328
00:18:56,708 --> 00:18:58,666
Maybe instead of blooming
every ten thousand years,

329
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:00,916
this one blooms
ten thousand times.

330
00:19:02,166 --> 00:19:03,458
And in the winter.

331
00:19:03,541 --> 00:19:05,916
It really is a miracle.

332
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,875
There's no other answer.

333
00:19:07,958 --> 00:19:10,458
No one knows what
this tree is thinking.

334
00:19:10,541 --> 00:19:13,166
Maybe, but that's
what makes it fun.

335
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:16,291
Nothing in the world
beats a good surprise.

336
00:19:16,375 --> 00:19:17,375
Guess not.

337
00:19:17,458 --> 00:19:18,750
No matter where we go,

338
00:19:18,833 --> 00:19:21,250
this tree is always here to
greet us when we return.

339
00:19:21,333 --> 00:19:23,291
Almost feels like
it's watching over us.

340
00:19:23,375 --> 00:19:25,000
[laughs]

341
00:19:25,083 --> 00:19:26,708
Indeed, it does.

342
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:28,541
Our citadel is fortunate.

343
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:32,416
It has this beautiful tree,
and a kind master to nurture it.

344
00:19:33,041 --> 00:19:34,500
Come on!

345
00:19:34,583 --> 00:19:37,208
How long are you going to keep
everyone waiting out there?

346
00:19:37,291 --> 00:19:38,500
[YASUSADA]
Hold on a sec!

347
00:19:39,458 --> 00:19:40,833
It's been a long time, okay?

348
00:19:40,916 --> 00:19:41,958
I'm nervous!

349
00:19:44,791 --> 00:19:45,833
Take this.

350
00:19:47,416 --> 00:19:49,750
[YASUSADA]
Wow, you fixed it!

351
00:19:49,833 --> 00:19:51,833
[KASHUU]
I improved it.

352
00:19:51,916 --> 00:19:54,708
I had a lot of spare time
while you were gone.

353
00:19:54,791 --> 00:19:55,916
[laughs]

354
00:19:59,541 --> 00:20:00,583
[KASHUU]
Here we are!

355
00:20:01,875 --> 00:20:03,583
Yamatonokami!

356
00:20:03,666 --> 00:20:05,833
So good to see you!

357
00:20:05,916 --> 00:20:07,250
Good to be back!

358
00:20:07,333 --> 00:20:09,791
You certainly took
your time, didn't you?

359
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:11,458
Glad you're home!

360
00:20:11,541 --> 00:20:14,000
I trust you found what
you were looking for?

361
00:20:14,083 --> 00:20:15,041
Yeah.

362
00:20:16,625 --> 00:20:19,625
[YASUSADA] I was once the
beloved sword of Okita Souji,

363
00:20:19,708 --> 00:20:23,583
but now I am proud to
serve a new master.

364
00:20:23,666 --> 00:20:25,958
I hope that I can
keep growing stronger,

365
00:20:26,041 --> 00:20:29,791
to protect my friends,
and to protect our home.

366
00:20:29,875 --> 00:20:31,791
[JIROUTACHI]
Hey, Yamatonokami!

367
00:20:31,875 --> 00:20:34,208
Stop spacing out and
get your butt over here!

368
00:20:34,291 --> 00:20:35,500
'Kay, I'll be right there!

369
00:20:38,375 --> 00:20:40,166
Thanks for being
patient with me.

370
00:20:45,166 --> 00:20:46,208
Oh!

371
00:20:46,291 --> 00:20:48,333
The cherry blossoms
are welcoming you!

372
00:20:51,666 --> 00:20:52,583
Okay!

373
00:20:52,666 --> 00:20:54,833
We finally have
everyone here now?

374
00:20:54,916 --> 00:20:56,916
Line up in front of
the cherry tree!

375
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,500
Do we have to sit still
for another dumb picture?

376
00:20:59,583 --> 00:21:02,541
You complain now, but you'll
be happy when you see it.

377
00:21:02,625 --> 00:21:03,333
Right?

378
00:21:03,416 --> 00:21:05,000
Don't worry, you guys.

379
00:21:05,083 --> 00:21:07,958
It's a brand new SLR camera--
you don't have to sit still.

380
00:21:08,041 --> 00:21:10,500
The master spared no expense!

381
00:21:10,583 --> 00:21:11,708
[HASEBE gasps]

382
00:21:12,791 --> 00:21:14,125
[HASEBE]
Why, Master?

383
00:21:15,208 --> 00:21:17,291
[MUTSUNOKAMI]
Come on, squeeze in!

384
00:21:17,375 --> 00:21:19,583
Long swords in the back!

385
00:21:19,666 --> 00:21:22,583
Except Hotarumaru.
You can be in front.

386
00:21:22,666 --> 00:21:24,041
[HOTARUMARU]
Got it.

387
00:21:24,125 --> 00:21:25,208
[KASHUU]
Get up here already.

388
00:21:25,291 --> 00:21:27,166
We need to be front and center.

389
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:28,958
Okay, here we go!

390
00:21:29,041 --> 00:21:31,916
It's got a timer,
so I'm sneaking in too.

391
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,500
You all better smile!

392
00:21:45,625 --> 00:21:46,583
[AKITA laughs]

393
00:21:46,666 --> 00:21:47,708
[ATSUSHI laughs]

394
00:21:51,625 --> 00:21:55,208
[YASUSADA] I don't know,
this seems a little too cutesy.

395
00:21:55,291 --> 00:21:57,250
Well, I think it suits you.

396
00:21:57,333 --> 00:21:59,125
And what's wrong with cutesy?

397
00:21:59,208 --> 00:22:01,416
If you say so.

398
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:03,958
[KASHUU]
The master likes cute things.

399
00:22:04,041 --> 00:22:06,083
Don't you want to be popular?

400
00:22:17,833 --> 00:22:18,625
[YASUSADA]
Nope.

401
00:22:18,708 --> 00:22:20,083
Way too flashy.

402
00:23:52,291 --> 00:23:55,583
[ALL] This was a tale of the
legendary Sword Warriors

403
00:23:55,666 --> 00:24:00,125
and the Hanamaru days they
spent in a certain citadel.

404
00:24:00,208 --> 00:24:01,458
The end!
