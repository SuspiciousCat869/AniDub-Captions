[yelling]

167
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:49,625
The sheet got away!

168
00:08:49,708 --> 00:08:50,708
Uh-huh.

169
00:08:54,291 --> 00:08:56,833
This sucks. Why do I
have to do this crap?

170
00:08:57,666 --> 00:08:59,583
[yelling]

171
00:08:59,666 --> 00:09:00,958
Huh? What the--?

[HASEBE grunting]

177
00:09:38,875 --> 00:09:39,833
Stop that!

178
00:09:39,916 --> 00:09:41,458
Whatever it is, stop it!

179
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:45,250
[OTEGINE]
I can't stop it!

180
00:09:45,333 --> 00:09:46,208
[NIHONGOU]
There he is!

181
00:09:46,291 --> 00:09:48,958
We can salvage this!

182
00:09:49,041 --> 00:09:50,958
Make us fly, Otegine!

183
00:09:51,041 --> 00:09:52,916
[OTEGINE]
Not happening, man!

184
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:53,875
The clothesline!

185
00:09:53,958 --> 00:09:55,875
Use it like a pole vault!

186
00:09:55,958 --> 00:09:57,083
I told you!

187
00:09:57,166 --> 00:09:58,833
I'm only good at
stabbing things!

188
00:09:58,916 --> 00:10:03,375
I was never meant... to... fly!

189
00:10:03,875 --> 00:10:06,500
[yelling]

190
00:10:09,083 --> 00:10:11,083
[NIHONGOU]
I won't lose this time!

191
00:10:11,166 --> 00:10:12,125
Gotcha!

192
00:10:14,375 --> 00:10:16,166
[NIHONGOU]
Damn you, bird!

193
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:17,833
[yelling]

194
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:29,541
Bluebird! Don't sit there!

195
00:10:29,625 --> 00:10:31,500
My spear is so sharp
that even a dragonfly

196
00:10:31,583 --> 00:10:33,416
would be cut in two
on its point!

197
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:37,958
[gasp]

198
00:10:38,583 --> 00:10:40,458
[BLUEBIRD laughs]

00:10:40,541 --> 00:10:41,750
What the hell?!

200
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:45,041
[NIHONGOU]
Oh! Aww...

201
00:10:45,125 --> 00:10:46,875
[laughing]

202
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:49,416
Seems like the bluebird
is the winner this time.

00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:50,791
[MIKAZUKI laughs]

204
00:10:50,875 --> 00:10:53,083
Too bad for them, but
at least we got a good show!

205
00:11:09,666 --> 00:11:10,833
Gokotai?

206
00:11:10,916 --> 00:11:12,833
Um... I'm back.

207
00:11:12,916 --> 00:11:15,041
[NIHONGOU]
What've you got there?

208
00:11:15,125 --> 00:11:16,833
[GOKOTAI]
I-It's a protection charm.

209
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,500
Uh, everyone in the citadel
is making their own these days.

210
00:11:21,583 --> 00:11:23,250
You pick out something
that's special to you

211
00:11:23,333 --> 00:11:25,416
and you put it inside the pouch.

212
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,041
I-I thought you
might not have one,

213
00:11:27,125 --> 00:11:29,125
since you haven't been
at the citadel for long,

214
00:11:29,208 --> 00:11:30,625
so I brought an extra.

215
00:11:30,708 --> 00:11:33,208
Could I maybe
borrow that feather?

216
00:11:33,291 --> 00:11:34,708
[NIHONGOU]
Oh. Sure.

217
00:11:43,875 --> 00:11:46,333
[GOKOTAI]
I... I hope you like it.

218
00:11:46,416 --> 00:11:47,583
Thanks, kiddo.

219
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:50,583
Happiness is always
there waiting.

220
00:11:50,666 --> 00:11:52,333
You only need to look.

221
00:11:52,416 --> 00:11:54,750
That's the lesson
of the story, isn't it?

222
00:11:54,833 --> 00:11:56,166
Umm...

223
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:58,375
Speaking of happiness, I really
enjoyed your acrobatics.

224
00:11:58,458 --> 00:11:59,375
[NIHONGOU]
Acrobatics?

225
00:11:59,458 --> 00:12:00,708
Do... Do you think
you could do it

226
00:12:00,791 --> 00:12:02,166
one more time for me?

227
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:04,583
Once was enough already!

228
00:12:04,666 --> 00:12:07,750
[ALL laughing]

229
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:14,666
Ah, splendid.

230
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:16,416
Life is splendid.

231
00:12:21,666 --> 00:12:24,625
[crying]

232
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:30,708
You hear that?

233
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:32,458
Someone is crying.

234
00:12:32,541 --> 00:12:33,958
It's kinda creepy.

235
00:12:34,041 --> 00:12:35,958
It's awfully late.
I wonder who it could be?

236
00:12:36,041 --> 00:12:37,833
Wha--What if it's a ghost?

237
00:12:37,916 --> 00:12:40,125
[crying continues]

238
00:12:40,208 --> 00:12:41,583
It's getting closer.

239
00:12:43,125 --> 00:12:44,125
Hey, guys?

240
00:12:44,208 --> 00:12:45,333
[sniffles]

241
00:12:45,416 --> 00:12:46,666
[HIRANO]
Akita?

242
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:48,041
What's the matter, Akita?

243
00:12:48,125 --> 00:12:50,208
What are you doing up so late?

244
00:12:50,291 --> 00:12:52,166
I just saw a ghost
in the hallway.

245
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:53,416
Are you sure?

246
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:55,791
[AKITA]
I was walking to the bathroom

247
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:59,083
when I saw this floating
white shadow thing.

248
00:12:59,166 --> 00:13:02,250
It's like it was walking,
but it wasn't making any steps.

249
00:13:02,333 --> 00:13:04,916
It was scary,
but I followed it anyway.

250
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,083
--And then--
--[NAMAZUO] Bwah!

251
00:13:06,166 --> 00:13:07,916
[scream]

252
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,833
Don't scream like that;
people are sleeping!

253
00:13:09,916 --> 00:13:11,333
It seemed like the thing to do.

254
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:13,791
Please... don't scare
me like that.

255
00:13:13,875 --> 00:13:16,083
So, continue the story.

256
00:13:16,166 --> 00:13:17,791
All of a sudden,
I lost sight of it--

257
00:13:17,875 --> 00:13:19,666
it was like it vanished!

258
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:21,166
Then I knew.

259
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:22,125
It's a ghost!

260
00:13:22,208 --> 00:13:23,083
Oh, yeah?

261
00:13:23,166 --> 00:13:24,375
Oh. Please, no...

262
00:13:24,458 --> 00:13:26,875
So, does this mean that
the citadel is haunted?

263
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:28,958
How are you even
supposed to deal with this?

264
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:30,375
We gotta do something.

265
00:13:30,458 --> 00:13:32,250
How 'bout we ask
Ichi for advice?

266
00:13:32,333 --> 00:13:33,125
No way.

267
00:13:33,208 --> 00:13:34,333
We'll handle this on our own.

268
00:13:34,416 --> 00:13:35,166
[HIRANO gasps]

269
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:36,416
Yeah, we'd better.

270
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:38,291
We were just bragging
about getting strong.

271
00:13:38,375 --> 00:13:40,041
We have to walk the walk, too.

272
00:13:40,125 --> 00:13:41,791
Yeah, we can't let Ichi down.

273
00:13:41,875 --> 00:13:43,375
What's one ghost, anyway?

274
00:13:43,458 --> 00:13:44,208
Well...

275
00:13:44,291 --> 00:13:45,833
It's scary!

276
00:13:45,916 --> 00:13:48,000
[YAGEN] Unfortunately,
we have no experience

277
00:13:48,083 --> 00:13:49,500
dealing with the undead.

278
00:13:49,583 --> 00:13:51,750
If only we knew where to start.

279
00:13:51,833 --> 00:13:53,791
I think I know
someone who does.

280
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:55,708
We'll go and ask the expert.

281
00:13:55,791 --> 00:13:57,166
We'll be right back.

282
00:13:59,041 --> 00:14:01,208
[HAKATA]
Who were they talking about?

283
00:14:01,291 --> 00:14:03,208
Nikkari Aoe,
if I had to guess.

284
00:14:03,291 --> 00:14:05,041
I don't think I know this story.

285
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:08,875
[YAGEN] They say that
he was used to strike down

286
00:14:08,958 --> 00:14:10,666
the ghost of a laughing woman.

287
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:12,625
That's actually how
he earned his name.

288
00:14:12,708 --> 00:14:14,416
So yeah, he's the expert.

289
00:14:15,708 --> 00:14:17,541
Then there's nothing
to worry about after all!

290
00:14:17,625 --> 00:14:19,416
He'll make that ghost
double-dead in no time

291
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,708
and then we can all get
right back to sleep!

292
00:14:21,791 --> 00:14:23,125
Let's hope so.

293
00:14:26,041 --> 00:14:28,208
[NAMAZUO]
Hey, Nikkari?

294
00:14:28,291 --> 00:14:30,041
Are you awake?

295
00:14:30,125 --> 00:14:32,333
Yes? What is it
at this late hour?

296
00:14:32,416 --> 00:14:34,125
We've got a ghost emergency.

297
00:14:34,208 --> 00:14:35,458
How intriguing.

298
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:37,375
There's a haunting
in the citadel?

299
00:14:37,458 --> 00:14:38,750
[NAMAZUO]
That's right!

300
00:14:38,833 --> 00:14:41,958
Akita saw some white
floaty thing in the hallway.

301
00:14:42,041 --> 00:14:43,916
[NIKKARI] I can't say I've
ever experienced anything

302
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,750
like that here,
but I'll take your word for it.

303
00:14:46,833 --> 00:14:48,291
Think you can slay it?

304
00:14:48,375 --> 00:14:50,208
[NIKKARI]
Well... maybe.

305
00:14:50,291 --> 00:14:52,666
I've defeated one.
Bet I can defeat another.

306
00:14:55,083 --> 00:14:56,833
[YAGEN] I know it's late.
Thanks for coming.

307
00:14:56,916 --> 00:14:58,000
Think nothing of it--

308
00:14:58,083 --> 00:15:00,375
I'm quite curious about
this ghost myself.

309
00:15:00,458 --> 00:15:02,625
It's a rare opportunity,
if nothing else.

310
00:15:02,708 --> 00:15:05,916
We'll call ourselves the
Ghost Extermination Rangers!

311
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,916
The Ghost Extermination
what, now?

312
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:10,083
Me first!

313
00:15:10,166 --> 00:15:12,541
Namazuo! Blue Ranger!

314
00:15:13,958 --> 00:15:14,916
Huh?

315
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:17,791
No good?

316
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:20,250
Oh, I get it,
we need to pick a color!

317
00:15:20,333 --> 00:15:22,083
Hakata, Gold!

318
00:15:22,166 --> 00:15:23,708
Midare. I'm pink!

319
00:15:23,791 --> 00:15:25,333
And I'm pink too!

320
00:15:25,416 --> 00:15:26,708
[ATSUSHI]
Guess I'll be black.

321
00:15:26,791 --> 00:15:28,166
Silver, of course.

322
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:29,791
Purple Ranger.

323
00:15:29,875 --> 00:15:30,750
Yellow Ranger!

324
00:15:30,833 --> 00:15:31,875
And I'm brown!

325
00:15:31,958 --> 00:15:33,791
I'm the White Ranger!

326
00:15:33,875 --> 00:15:36,125
Green Ranger,
reporting for duty.

327
00:15:36,208 --> 00:15:37,166
We don't have a red one!

328
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:39,083
There always has
to be a red one!

329
00:15:39,166 --> 00:15:40,333
Ah, we'll be fine.

330
00:15:40,416 --> 00:15:41,458
Yeah, probably.

331
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:45,375
We are Nikkari Aoe and
the Awataguchi swords!

332
00:15:45,458 --> 00:15:47,583
Ghost Extermination Rangers, go!

333
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:58,833
Everyone, take good
care of your candles.

334
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:00,583
We'll split up to search faster,

335
00:16:00,666 --> 00:16:02,958
but call me immediately
if you see the ghost.

336
00:16:03,791 --> 00:16:05,458
Aw... This is too scary!

337
00:16:05,541 --> 00:16:06,708
Maybe we should stop.

338
00:16:06,791 --> 00:16:08,666
What, after that long intro?

339
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:09,750
Good one.

340
00:16:12,541 --> 00:16:14,875
Maybe I'll start a
ghost busting company.

341
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:17,166
Wait till the ghost
is busted, at least!

342
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:18,583
Let's go.

343
00:16:18,666 --> 00:16:20,416
Right! Come on!

344
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,000
Silver and Blue.

345
00:16:22,083 --> 00:16:23,458
Here!

346
00:16:23,541 --> 00:16:25,916
I think I have just
the plan to settle this.

347
00:16:26,916 --> 00:16:29,666
We'll lay a net
joined to a pulley here.

348
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:31,041
And when the ghost comes out,

349
00:16:31,125 --> 00:16:34,291
we'll tug on the rope and
capture it in the net.

350
00:16:34,375 --> 00:16:36,916
[NAMAZUO] Wait...
You can catch ghosts in nets?

351
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,666
Slaying it would
be such a waste.

352
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:41,083
I'm trying a different
approach this time.

353
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:44,250
We can save extermination
for later, if we'd like.

354
00:16:44,333 --> 00:16:47,458
I'm dying to see what a
surprised ghost looks like.

355
00:16:47,541 --> 00:16:49,875
That didn't answer
my question, but okay.

356
00:16:51,791 --> 00:16:53,666
Nikkari, I think
I found the ghost!

357
00:16:57,208 --> 00:16:58,458
[GOKOTAI]
It's this way.

358
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:01,708
[yells]

359
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:09,166
[NIKKARI] It seems there
really is a ghost here.

360
00:17:10,583 --> 00:17:14,250
I didn't suspect we
would find it so easily.

361
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:15,291
Huh?

362
00:17:16,541 --> 00:17:17,833
Wait. Tsurumaru?

363
00:17:17,916 --> 00:17:21,000
Are you guys having
some kind of night party?

364
00:17:21,083 --> 00:17:23,041
[GOKOTAI]
Is that Nakigitsune's fox?

365
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:24,250
[TSURUMARU]
Uh-huh.

366
00:17:24,333 --> 00:17:25,625
I guess he must have
gotten lost and wandered

367
00:17:25,708 --> 00:17:27,291
into my room by accident.

368
00:17:27,375 --> 00:17:29,750
I woke up covered in sweat,
'cause this little fuzzball

369
00:17:29,833 --> 00:17:32,583
decided to fall asleep
right on top of my head.

370
00:17:32,666 --> 00:17:34,833
[GOKOTAI] So you were just
taking him back then, huh?

371
00:17:36,291 --> 00:17:39,291
You know it really does
take a lot to surprise me.

372
00:17:39,375 --> 00:17:42,125
But a surprise from this
guy is always welcome.

373
00:17:42,208 --> 00:17:43,791
[yawns]

374
00:17:43,875 --> 00:17:46,125
I'm gonna go return him
now and get back to bed.

375
00:17:52,166 --> 00:17:54,250
[MAEDA]
Nikkari!

376
00:17:54,333 --> 00:17:57,250
Uh... I think the ghost
is talking now.

377
00:17:57,333 --> 00:17:58,541
[NIKKARI]
Interesting!

378
00:18:00,083 --> 00:18:01,958
And did you happen to
catch what it was saying?

379
00:18:02,041 --> 00:18:04,541
It sounded like
it was counting.

380
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:06,250
Then perhaps it's
the ghost of Okiku,

381
00:18:06,333 --> 00:18:08,041
counting the plates she
was accused of stealing

382
00:18:08,125 --> 00:18:09,541
before she was murdered.

383
00:18:09,625 --> 00:18:10,750
Is that real?

384
00:18:11,625 --> 00:18:14,083
[VOICE]
Seven...

385
00:18:15,458 --> 00:18:18,333
Would any ghosts
like to and come play?

386
00:18:18,416 --> 00:18:19,708
[VOICE]
Nine...

387
00:18:19,791 --> 00:18:23,041
You'd better answer,
or I'll cut you down.

388
00:18:23,125 --> 00:18:24,708
[DOUDANUKI]
And ten!

389
00:18:26,416 --> 00:18:28,375
[NIKKARI] Why are you
doing midnight pullups?

390
00:18:28,458 --> 00:18:30,916
I was bored and I
couldn't really sleep.

391
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,541
Now, only 970 to go!

392
00:18:33,625 --> 00:18:35,208
You realize if
you do that many,

393
00:18:35,291 --> 00:18:37,833
it'll be morning before
you're finished.

394
00:18:37,916 --> 00:18:39,750
[DOUDANUKI] Wanna have
a sparring match instead?

395
00:18:39,833 --> 00:18:41,250
[MAEDA]
Uh...

396
00:18:41,333 --> 00:18:43,416
I never knew it was
so lively at night.

397
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:46,833
[HAKATA]
It's the ghost!

398
00:18:46,916 --> 00:18:48,750
Do something, Nikkari!

399
00:18:53,166 --> 00:18:54,125
Okay.

400
00:18:59,916 --> 00:19:01,541
[NIKKARI]
Looks like a big one.

401
00:19:05,333 --> 00:19:07,291
Might I ask what
you're doing over there?

402
00:19:08,666 --> 00:19:10,750
[screaming]

403
00:19:10,833 --> 00:19:13,791
I'm entirely too drunk
to be cooking in the dark.

404
00:19:13,875 --> 00:19:15,000
Oh! Goodness!

405
00:19:15,083 --> 00:19:17,250
It would seem I have
an audience! [hiccup]

406
00:19:17,333 --> 00:19:18,500
Jirou!

407
00:19:18,583 --> 00:19:19,458
What the heck are you
doing with that knife

408
00:19:19,541 --> 00:19:20,958
in the middle of the night?

409
00:19:22,666 --> 00:19:24,166
Tomato juice?

410
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:26,166
I'm making midnight snacks!

411
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:28,750
I'll clean up when I can
actually see what I'm doing.

412
00:19:28,833 --> 00:19:31,083
But for now, it's drinking time!

413
00:19:31,166 --> 00:19:33,250
[humming]

414
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:35,500
We have found the target!

415
00:19:35,583 --> 00:19:37,083
White ghost, straight ahead!

416
00:19:38,958 --> 00:19:40,166
[gasp]

417
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:42,250
[menacing chuckle]

418
00:19:42,333 --> 00:19:44,458
You had better not
let me down this time.

419
00:19:46,125 --> 00:19:48,458
[NIKKARI]
Face me, apparition!

420
00:19:48,541 --> 00:19:50,458
I'll send you to the afterlife!

421
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:54,125
[KASEN]
Huh?

422
00:19:54,208 --> 00:19:55,458
Kasen?

423
00:19:55,541 --> 00:19:58,083
Surely the laundry
could wait until morning.

424
00:19:58,166 --> 00:19:59,500
Normally, yes.

425
00:19:59,583 --> 00:20:02,458
But this time it's a
covert laundry operation.

426
00:20:02,541 --> 00:20:04,833
I'm afraid that you've lost me.

427
00:20:04,916 --> 00:20:07,541
[KASEN]
This is Yamanbagiri's cloak.

428
00:20:07,625 --> 00:20:09,000
As I'm sure you've noticed,

429
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:11,333
he never lets it out of
his sight during the day.

430
00:20:11,416 --> 00:20:13,333
So I'm required to
take extreme measures

431
00:20:13,416 --> 00:20:15,583
and wash it while he's sleeping.

432
00:20:15,666 --> 00:20:18,208
Of course, I'd prefer
if the white was brighter.

433
00:20:18,291 --> 00:20:20,500
But if I'm too obvious
about it, he'll notice.

434
00:20:20,583 --> 00:20:23,000
So "clean," but not
"suspiciously clean."

435
00:20:23,083 --> 00:20:25,000
Feels like you're
doing us all a favor.

436
00:20:25,083 --> 00:20:27,333
I always wondered why
that thing smells so nice,

437
00:20:27,416 --> 00:20:29,500
even though it looks so awful.

438
00:20:29,583 --> 00:20:33,708
I fear it's too clean this time;
perhaps I should dirty it up.

439
00:20:35,916 --> 00:20:38,875
[NIKKARI] I think it's safe to
say now that there is no ghost.

440
00:20:38,958 --> 00:20:40,166
I don't blame Akita, though--

441
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:41,750
it's late and he was tired.

442
00:20:41,833 --> 00:20:43,000
We caught the ghost!

443
00:20:43,083 --> 00:20:45,708
I set the trap like you
said and it worked out!

444
00:20:45,791 --> 00:20:47,125
[NIKKARI]
Huh?

445
00:20:47,208 --> 00:20:50,041
I know it was my idea,
but still, that's a surprise.

446
00:20:52,708 --> 00:20:53,666
[AKITA gasps]

447
00:20:54,166 --> 00:20:56,000
That's it!
That's the ghost I saw!

448
00:20:56,083 --> 00:20:57,666
[NIKKARI]
It's not moving.

449
00:20:57,750 --> 00:20:59,583
Let's see your face, shall we?

450
00:21:01,833 --> 00:21:03,666
Kosetsu? What's going on here?

451
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:05,750
Oh, no, why's he up there?

452
00:21:05,833 --> 00:21:07,208
My apologies.

453
00:21:07,291 --> 00:21:10,041
I appears I've caused
quite the commotion tonight.

454
00:21:11,791 --> 00:21:14,041
[KOUSETSU] I had gone
to the bathroom with Sayo.

455
00:21:14,125 --> 00:21:16,291
But because of the
recent room change,

456
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:19,666
I was unable to navigate back
to our quarters in the dark.

457
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:21,541
Thus, my wandering
in the hallway.

458
00:21:23,125 --> 00:21:25,333
That's why you
fell for the trap.

459
00:21:25,416 --> 00:21:27,208
Hold on. I'll help you.

460
00:21:27,291 --> 00:21:29,333
[KOUSETSU]
No, that won't be necessary.

461
00:21:29,416 --> 00:21:30,291
We're fine.

462
00:21:30,375 --> 00:21:32,291
In the net?

463
00:21:32,375 --> 00:21:33,791
Oh, I see.

464
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:36,125
Sayo does seem rather
comfortable in there,

465
00:21:36,208 --> 00:21:37,958
doesn't he?

466
00:21:38,041 --> 00:21:40,458
Your trap is rather
like a hammock, actually.

467
00:21:40,541 --> 00:21:43,250
It makes for a suitable bed.

468
00:21:43,333 --> 00:21:46,125
And it would be a
pity to disturb Sayo.

469
00:21:46,208 --> 00:21:49,125
Cut us free in the morning
if we're still here.

470
00:21:49,208 --> 00:21:50,166
All right.

471
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:53,708
Well, there you have it.

472
00:21:53,791 --> 00:21:55,958
Now, time to go back to bed.

473
00:21:56,041 --> 00:21:57,250
[GROUP]
Okay!

474
00:21:57,333 --> 00:21:59,458
Thanks for helping
us solve the case.

475
00:21:59,541 --> 00:22:01,500
Someday the Ghost
Extermination Rangers

476
00:22:01,583 --> 00:22:03,000
may be needed again.

477
00:22:03,083 --> 00:22:05,291
The Green Ranger shall
be happy to heed your call

478
00:22:05,375 --> 00:22:06,333
at any time.

479
00:22:06,416 --> 00:22:08,083
See you in the morning.

480
00:22:08,166 --> 00:22:09,125
[NIKKARI]
Three.

481
00:22:09,708 --> 00:22:10,916
[AKITA]
Good night.

482
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:11,791
[NIKKARI]
Four.

483
00:22:11,875 --> 00:22:13,125
[ATSUSHI yawns]
Good night.

484
00:22:13,208 --> 00:22:14,000
[NIKKARI]
Five.

485
00:22:14,083 --> 00:22:14,875
[MAEDA, HIRANO]
Good night.

486
00:22:14,958 --> 00:22:15,916
[NIKKARI]
Six, seven.

487
