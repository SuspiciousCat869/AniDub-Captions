00:00:08,416 --> 00:00:11,000
[KOGITSUNEMARU]
The year is 2205 AD.

2
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:19,416
The History Retrograde Army
seeks to control the world

3
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:21,083
by altering its past.

4
00:00:22,416 --> 00:00:23,875
Born from the heart of swords,

5
00:00:23,958 --> 00:00:27,125
we travel through time to
intercept and eliminate them.

6
00:00:30,166 --> 00:00:32,833
But you'd rather dance
with this little fox, right?

7
00:02:03,583 --> 00:02:05,208
[KASHUU, YASUSADA]
This is a tale of the legendary

8
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:07,625
Sword Warriors
and the Hanamaru days

9
00:02:07,708 --> 00:02:10,583
they spent in a certain citadel.

10
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:17,583
[AKASHI]
This is for me?

11
00:02:17,666 --> 00:02:19,166
Thank you.

12
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:21,291
And what's it for?

13
00:02:21,375 --> 00:02:23,250
Okay, of course.

14
00:02:23,333 --> 00:02:25,041
Right. If I think
of anything else,

15
00:02:25,125 --> 00:02:27,208
I'll ask Hotarumaru
and the others.

16
00:02:27,291 --> 00:02:29,916
Now, if everything is
in order, I'll take my leave.

17
00:02:33,208 --> 00:02:34,458
[AKASHI]
Oh, hello.

18
00:02:34,541 --> 00:02:37,000
They certainly like to run
their mouth, don't they?

19
00:02:37,083 --> 00:02:38,208
Well, never mind that.

20
00:02:38,291 --> 00:02:40,208
More importantly, when's dinner?

21
00:02:44,541 --> 00:02:46,166
We're all alone, right?

22
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:47,875
Yeah.

23
00:02:47,958 --> 00:02:49,416
What's this about?

24
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:53,041
That's a rather serious look
you're both aiming at me.

25
00:02:53,125 --> 00:02:54,708
Listen, Kuniyuki...

26
00:02:54,791 --> 00:02:55,958
[AKASHI]
Hm?

27
00:02:56,041 --> 00:02:57,416
We still need to take
you to greet everyone

28
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:58,625
at the citadel.

29
00:02:58,708 --> 00:03:01,041
Think you could be bit
more proper, please?

30
00:03:01,125 --> 00:03:03,166
"A bit more proper?"

31
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:05,000
Like... the way I act?

32
00:03:05,083 --> 00:03:05,958
[AIZEN]
Yeah.

33
00:03:06,041 --> 00:03:07,416
[AKASHI]
That's not my thing--

34
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,000
I don't care what
people think of me.

35
00:03:09,083 --> 00:03:10,708
But first impressions matter!

36
00:03:10,791 --> 00:03:12,916
Just be friendly
and polite, you know?

37
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,291
I'm confused.

38
00:03:14,375 --> 00:03:16,166
What's not to like about me?

39
00:03:19,833 --> 00:03:22,333
[HOTARUMARU] Okay, "friendly"
might be too much to hope for.

40
00:03:24,166 --> 00:03:25,875
[AKASHI]
Come on, stop whispering.

41
00:03:25,958 --> 00:03:27,875
Why is this such a big deal?

42
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:29,833
We're just kind of worried
about you fitting in

43
00:03:29,916 --> 00:03:31,041
and making friends here.

44
00:03:31,125 --> 00:03:32,625
That sort of thing.

45
00:03:32,708 --> 00:03:35,166
You're serious. Am I
really that much trouble?

46
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:37,666
[HOTARUMARU] You do
hate working an awful lot.

47
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:39,708
[yawns]

48
00:03:39,791 --> 00:03:42,833
Motivation isn't my strong
point-- that much is true.

49
00:03:42,916 --> 00:03:45,000
That's exactly what
we're talking about!

50
00:03:45,083 --> 00:03:48,083
Caring for each other is an
important part of living here!

51
00:03:48,166 --> 00:03:49,291
We both agree.

52
00:03:49,375 --> 00:03:50,500
[HOTARUMARU]
Mm-hmm.

53
00:03:50,583 --> 00:03:52,875
Maybe just don't...
expect so much from me?

54
00:03:54,083 --> 00:03:55,958
[AKASHI sighs]
Stop giving me that look.

55
00:03:56,041 --> 00:03:58,125
I can't magically start
caring about something

56
00:03:58,208 --> 00:03:59,791
just because you tell me to.

57
00:03:59,875 --> 00:04:02,333
Start with the
simple stuff, you know.

58
00:04:02,416 --> 00:04:04,208
Like helping people
when they're in trouble.

59
00:04:04,291 --> 00:04:05,541
Yeah, easy!

60
00:04:05,625 --> 00:04:08,750
Or pitching in with the
chores like everyone else.

61
00:04:08,833 --> 00:04:10,083
Do some weeding.

62
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:11,375
Or sweeping.

63
00:04:11,458 --> 00:04:14,375
Fold some laundry, maybe,
or wash some dishes.

64
00:04:14,458 --> 00:04:15,958
[AKASHI]
My specialty is eating.

65
00:04:16,041 --> 00:04:18,041
Can I do that?

66
00:04:18,125 --> 00:04:19,291
I want you to like it here,

67
00:04:19,375 --> 00:04:21,166
and I want everyone
here to like you.

68
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:22,708
Is that too much to ask?

69
00:04:22,791 --> 00:04:23,750
Kuniyuki?

70
00:04:25,666 --> 00:04:26,916
[AKASHI]
Bathroom.

71
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,833
[AIZEN]
Oh, here, I'll show you the way.

72
00:04:30,125 --> 00:04:31,833
[AKASHI] It's just down
the hallway, right?

73
00:04:31,916 --> 00:04:33,875
We passed it earlier. I know.

74
00:04:33,958 --> 00:04:34,958
You sure?

75
00:04:38,916 --> 00:04:40,916
We might have
overdone it a little bit.

76
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,708
I mean, he just got here.

77
00:04:42,791 --> 00:04:45,500
You and I both know that
subtlety wouldn't work on him.

78
00:04:45,583 --> 00:04:47,041
I guess you're right.

79
00:04:47,125 --> 00:04:47,916
But still.

80
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,416
You just want the best for him.

81
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,375
Same with me.

82
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:54,666
If we don't help,
he'll just hole himself up.

83
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:57,416
"I don't need to meet people and
people don't need to meet me"

84
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:58,541
sort of thing.

85
00:05:04,833 --> 00:05:09,500
Maybe I was a little hard
on him for his first day here.

86
00:05:09,583 --> 00:05:10,958
He's been gone a while.

87
00:05:12,541 --> 00:05:13,541
Uh-huh.

88
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,958
Do you think he got lost?

00:05:19,041 --> 00:05:20,291
[HASEBE screams]

90
00:05:24,166 --> 00:05:25,541
[AIZEN]
What wrong?

91
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:27,125
[YASUSADA] I took my eyes
off the field for a second,

92
00:05:27,208 --> 00:05:28,208
then this happened.

93
00:05:28,291 --> 00:05:30,208
[HASEBE]
Ruined! The crops are ruined!

94
00:05:30,291 --> 00:05:32,208
And we were just
about to harvest them!

95
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:33,916
Yeah, that looks bad all right.

96
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,750
This is a tragedy!

97
00:05:35,833 --> 00:05:37,333
What could've done this?

98
00:05:37,416 --> 00:05:39,333
Some sort of wild animal.

99
00:05:39,416 --> 00:05:41,750
I suppose the traps
that I set weren't enough.

100
00:05:43,416 --> 00:05:45,708
[YASUSADA]
Wait, that's a shoe print!

101
00:05:45,791 --> 00:05:46,791
[GROUP gasps]

102
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:53,083
Something wrong?

103
00:05:53,166 --> 00:05:55,916
We're roasting sweet potatoes,
or we were about to.

104
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,125
Uh-huh. We collected a
bunch of dried leaves to burn,

105
00:05:59,208 --> 00:06:02,125
but when we came back,
they weren't here anymore.

106
00:06:02,208 --> 00:06:03,666
Maybe someone thought
they were trash

107
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:05,458
and threw them away.

108
00:06:05,541 --> 00:06:07,250
[KASHUU]
Guess we'll gather some more.

109
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:08,666
[KASEN]
What is this madness?

110
00:06:11,625 --> 00:06:13,958
They were so clean
only moments ago--

111
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:16,666
their pure whiteness
shining in the sun.

112
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:18,541
Now they're perfectly filthy.

113
00:06:18,625 --> 00:06:19,875
You must be dead inside.

114
00:06:19,958 --> 00:06:21,125
It's just laundry.

115
00:06:21,208 --> 00:06:22,666
That's his whole life.

116
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:23,583
This is odd.

117
00:06:23,666 --> 00:06:24,750
[ALL]
Hmm?

118
00:06:24,833 --> 00:06:26,500
They were clearly
knocked to the ground,

119
00:06:26,583 --> 00:06:28,916
and yet they're
folded so neatly.

120
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,333
Is this someone's
idea of a joke?

121
00:06:31,416 --> 00:06:33,541
You don't think
it was him, do you?

122
00:06:33,625 --> 00:06:35,041
It could be, but why?

123
00:06:35,125 --> 00:06:36,875
He doesn't care about laundry.

124
00:06:36,958 --> 00:06:39,583
Unless it's food, it might
as well be invisible.

125
00:06:39,666 --> 00:06:40,791
What are you muttering about?

126
00:06:40,875 --> 00:06:42,166
Do you two know something?

127
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:43,416
No, sir!

128
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:44,916
You don't think it's
the new recruit, do you?

129
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,375
If not, it could be the enemy!

130
00:06:47,458 --> 00:06:48,875
They've infiltrated our base?

131
00:06:50,208 --> 00:06:51,875
We've gotta go find him fast.

132
00:06:51,958 --> 00:06:53,708
What if it was Kuniyuki?

133
00:06:53,791 --> 00:06:54,958
I know he's not very friendly,

134
00:06:55,041 --> 00:06:56,916
but this seems like
a stretch to me.

135
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,333
Only way to find out
is to ask him ourselves.

136
00:07:04,708 --> 00:07:05,833
That's odd.

137
00:07:05,916 --> 00:07:08,208
I could've sworn I left
the rice balls here.

138
00:07:08,291 --> 00:07:10,375
Did someone steal
the plate, too?

139
00:07:10,458 --> 00:07:11,791
[SHOKUDAIKIRI]
Who would do that?

140
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:16,541
[AIZEN] Okay, missing food?
Now I'm worried.

141
00:07:16,625 --> 00:07:18,708
Wasn't he eating
before he left, though?

142
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:22,625
[HOTARUMARU, AIZEN]
Kuniyuki!

143
00:07:24,708 --> 00:07:26,666
[AKASHI]
You two are pale as ghosts.

144
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:27,833
What's the problem?

145
00:07:27,916 --> 00:07:30,000
Are you the culprit?

146
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:31,416
Let's go.

147
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:34,166
If we apologize together,
maybe they'll understand.

148
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:35,625
[AKASHI]
What are you talking about?

149
00:07:35,708 --> 00:07:37,250
You stole those rice balls,

150
00:07:37,333 --> 00:07:39,083
then there's the laundry
and the crop fields.

151
00:07:39,166 --> 00:07:41,625
[HASEBE] I think it's
time for an explanation.

152
00:07:41,708 --> 00:07:43,750
I haven't seen
you around before.

153
00:07:43,833 --> 00:07:45,250
You must be the new recruit.

154
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:48,375
The name is Akashi Kuniyuki.

155
00:07:48,458 --> 00:07:50,666
A pleasure to meet you all.

156
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:51,541
What's that?

157
00:07:51,625 --> 00:07:52,583
This plate?

158
00:07:52,666 --> 00:07:54,541
Sorry, I was really hungry.

159
00:07:54,625 --> 00:07:57,125
[KASEN] Are you the one
who dirtied the laundry?

160
00:07:57,208 --> 00:07:58,750
[AKASHI]
Yes, my hand slipped.

161
00:07:58,833 --> 00:08:00,708
[YASUSADA] And did you
damage the crops, too?

162
00:08:00,791 --> 00:08:01,875
Uh-huh.

163
00:08:01,958 --> 00:08:03,416
[KASHUU] And threw away
our dried leaves?

164
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,125
[AKASHI]
Indeed--Guilty as charged.

165
00:08:05,208 --> 00:08:07,708
This guy's certainly
a troublemaker, isn't he?

166
00:08:07,791 --> 00:08:08,541
[AIZEN]
He's not!

167
00:08:08,625 --> 00:08:09,666
[HOTARUMARU]
I promise!

168
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:11,083
[AIZEN]
He was just running an errand,

169
00:08:11,166 --> 00:08:12,625
and he got confused, is all.

170
00:08:12,708 --> 00:08:14,291
It's just 'cause he's new here.

171
00:08:14,375 --> 00:08:16,083
You don't have
to lie for my sake.

172
00:08:16,166 --> 00:08:17,166
Listen to me!

173
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:18,291
[YAGEN]
Hey!

174
00:08:18,375 --> 00:08:20,041
Some of my medicine is missing.

175
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:21,125
Who took it?

176
00:08:21,208 --> 00:08:22,416
Wait, what's up?

177
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:23,958
You stole medicine too?

178
00:08:24,041 --> 00:08:25,458
Yes, I did.

179
00:08:25,541 --> 00:08:27,541
[HASEBE]
Care to tell us why?

180
00:08:27,625 --> 00:08:29,375
[TANUKI howling]

181
00:08:29,458 --> 00:08:30,541
What is that?

182
00:08:32,416 --> 00:08:34,250
[AKASHI]
I told you to hide, didn't I?

183
00:08:35,916 --> 00:08:37,083
So that's it!

184
00:08:41,833 --> 00:08:42,791
[YASUSADA]
A-ha!

185
00:08:43,833 --> 00:08:45,291
[KASEN]
They're <i>tanuki</i> .

186
00:08:45,375 --> 00:08:47,000
[KASHUU]
We found the leaves.

187
00:08:47,083 --> 00:08:49,083
What happened?

188
00:08:49,166 --> 00:08:51,250
You're gonna make me
explain, aren't you?

189
00:08:51,333 --> 00:08:52,916
[AIZEN]
That would be nice, yeah.

190
00:08:53,916 --> 00:08:55,708
[AKASHI] I heard them crying
when I was coming back

191
00:08:55,791 --> 00:08:57,625
from the bathroom.

192
00:08:57,708 --> 00:08:59,583
[TANUKI howling]

193
00:08:59,666 --> 00:09:02,083
[AKASHI]
Two children under the porch.

194
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:03,625
I wondered where
the mother went,

195
00:09:03,708 --> 00:09:07,375
so I went searching, just in
case something bad had happened.

196
00:09:07,458 --> 00:09:08,625
[AKASHI]
What a mess.

197
00:09:18,125 --> 00:09:20,500
[AKASHI] You're not gonna make
this easy for me, are you?

198
00:09:22,916 --> 00:09:25,666
[HASEBE] Then, it was the <i>tanuki</i>
that caused all this mischief,

199
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:27,250
not you.

200
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:28,583
[AKASHI]
Not quite.

201
00:09:28,666 --> 00:09:31,250
I still borrowed a couple
of things, after all.

202
00:09:31,333 --> 00:09:34,041
You did it for the <i>tanuki</i> ,
so we'll forgive you.

203
00:09:34,125 --> 00:09:35,750
Thanks for understanding.

204
00:09:35,833 --> 00:09:37,208
I'm glad it all worked out.

205
00:09:37,291 --> 00:09:39,666
You really had us freaking
out for a second there.

206
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:42,416
It is a bit out
of character for you.

207
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,541
[AKASHI] I'm supposed to
be your guardian, right?

208
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:46,708
Maybe I related to
this mother a little.

209
00:09:46,791 --> 00:09:48,958
And we care for each
other at the citadel.

210
00:09:49,041 --> 00:09:50,958
That is what you told me, right?

211
00:09:53,583 --> 00:09:55,541
[NIKKARI]
All's well that ends well.

212
00:09:55,625 --> 00:09:57,708
[KASEN] No harm in doing
the laundry again.

213
00:09:57,791 --> 00:09:58,708
[AKASHI chuckles]

214
00:09:58,791 --> 00:10:00,125
You know what this means.

215
00:10:00,208 --> 00:10:02,666
Time to start prepping for
Akashi's welcoming party.

216
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:04,833
I'm not too busy;
let me help you out.

217
00:10:04,916 --> 00:10:07,916
That's really unnecessary.
It's nothing to celebrate.

218
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,625
No, really, we insist.

219
00:10:09,708 --> 00:10:12,500
It's not every day a new
comrade joins us, you know.

220
00:10:12,583 --> 00:10:13,791
That's right!

221
00:10:13,875 --> 00:10:15,583
Here, let me see it.

222
00:10:15,666 --> 00:10:17,500
I might be able to help its leg.

223
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:18,750
That would be great.

224
00:10:19,583 --> 00:10:22,125
[AIZEN chuckles]
He's going to fit in just fine.

225
00:10:22,208 --> 00:10:24,958
[HOTARUMARU] Guess we didn't
need to worry that much anyway.

226
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:26,166
Guess not.

227
00:10:27,625 --> 00:10:29,916
Hey! Hotarumaru, Aizen!

228
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,666
I think I'd like to meet
everyone else after all.

229
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:33,708
[BOTH laugh]

230
00:10:33,791 --> 00:10:34,875
--[AIZEN] Okay!
--[HOTARUMARU] Sure!

231
00:10:39,125 --> 00:10:41,000
[YASUSADA]
Whoa, that looks tasty!

232
00:10:43,541 --> 00:10:46,208
I told you to wait
till it cools, didn't I?

233
00:10:46,291 --> 00:10:48,333
[BOTH laughing]

234
00:10:48,416 --> 00:10:49,833
[AIZEN laughs]

235
00:10:49,916 --> 00:10:52,333
If you're really awesome,
you put red bean paste on top.

236
00:10:54,125 --> 00:10:55,583
[AIZEN]
Mmm! Mmm!

237
00:10:55,666 --> 00:10:56,458
So good!

238
00:10:56,541 --> 00:10:57,958
Okay, I get it!

239
00:10:58,041 --> 00:10:59,000
You don't have to spit!

240
00:10:59,083 --> 00:11:00,791
Bean paste, huh?

241
00:11:00,875 --> 00:11:02,833
That's fine, but I was told
that this mayonnaise stuff

242
00:11:02,916 --> 00:11:04,000
goes with everything.

243
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:07,541
Disgusting!

244
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:10,000
The modern world is full
of lies and deception!

245
00:11:10,083 --> 00:11:12,541
[HOTARUMARU] Maybe try
some moderation next time.

246
00:11:12,625 --> 00:11:16,083
[AKASHI] Suffer with me.
I'm lonely. Here.

247
00:11:16,166 --> 00:11:17,500
Suffer alone!

248
00:11:17,583 --> 00:11:19,041
[laughs]

249
00:11:19,125 --> 00:11:21,083
What a delightful
group they are!

250
00:11:21,166 --> 00:11:22,083
Indeed.

251
00:11:22,166 --> 00:11:24,083
I do like them.

252
00:11:24,166 --> 00:11:27,416
[ISHIKIRIMARU] Akashi is
our 46th Sword Warrior.

253
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:30,416
It feels like the citadel
gets more lively every day.

254
00:11:37,666 --> 00:11:38,875
Aren't those so hot?

255
00:11:38,958 --> 00:11:40,666
Is your tongue made of lava?

256
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:42,208
[MIKAZUKI chuckles]

257
00:11:42,291 --> 00:11:45,250
I would expect nothing
less of Benkei's polearm.

258
00:11:45,333 --> 00:11:47,291
His master was rather tough.

259
00:11:47,375 --> 00:11:48,833
[IWATOOSHI laughs]

260
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:50,166
Wait a second!

261
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:52,166
If he's like Benkei,
does that mean I'm handsome

262
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:53,625
like Yoshitsune?

263
00:11:53,708 --> 00:11:55,208
[MIKAZUKI laughs]

264
00:11:55,291 --> 00:11:56,916
That seems to be the case.

265
00:11:57,791 --> 00:11:58,833
[IMANOTSURUGI]
Yay!

266
00:12:01,291 --> 00:12:03,875
And Yamatonokami
here is like Ohkita Souji

267
00:12:03,958 --> 00:12:05,458
from the Shinsengumi.

268
00:12:05,541 --> 00:12:07,250
Kind of.

269
00:12:07,333 --> 00:12:08,958
[KASHUU laughs]

270
00:12:09,041 --> 00:12:09,875
"Kind of."

271
00:12:09,958 --> 00:12:11,083
[laughing]

272
00:12:13,791 --> 00:12:15,541
[IWATOOSHI laughing]

273
00:12:15,625 --> 00:12:17,916
Yamatonokami's as
good with a sword as Okita,

274
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,958
and that's all
that matters to me.

275
00:12:20,041 --> 00:12:23,500
And with Kashuu around, it's
almost like having two Okitas.

276
00:12:23,583 --> 00:12:25,833
They've got more
experience than anyone else.

277
00:12:25,916 --> 00:12:27,750
You guys don't need
to change a thing.

278
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,208
Of course not.

279
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:31,625
But thank you.

280
00:12:31,708 --> 00:12:33,000
Glad we pass.

281
00:12:37,166 --> 00:12:39,041
[KASHUU]
Something on your mind?

282
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:40,458
Not really.

283
00:12:40,541 --> 00:12:42,375
I was just wondering
what Kogitsunemaru's

284
00:12:42,458 --> 00:12:44,041
previous master was like.

285
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:46,208
[ISHIKIRIMARU]
Oh, hello.

286
00:12:46,291 --> 00:12:48,583
How long have you been here?

287
00:12:48,666 --> 00:12:50,583
Honebami Toushirou.

288
00:12:50,666 --> 00:12:52,875
You're the master's attendant
right now, correct?

289
00:12:52,958 --> 00:12:54,708
What's that in your hand?

290
00:12:54,791 --> 00:12:56,333
Our dispatch orders.

291
00:12:57,708 --> 00:12:59,083
Ah.

292
00:12:59,166 --> 00:13:02,333
[HONEBAMI] Yamatonokami
Yasusada, Mikazuki Munechika.

293
00:13:02,416 --> 00:13:03,625
Kogitsunemaru.

294
00:13:03,708 --> 00:13:05,458
I will be happy to serve.

295
00:13:05,541 --> 00:13:06,791
Mm-hmm.

296
00:13:06,875 --> 00:13:09,583
Shall we prepare to depart?

297
00:13:09,666 --> 00:13:12,041
And also, Tsurumaru Kuninaga,

298
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:14,958
Yagen Toushirou,
and your captain this time,

299
00:13:15,041 --> 00:13:16,375
Ichigo Hitofuri.

300
00:13:16,458 --> 00:13:19,000
I'll go inform them while
everyone else gets ready.

301
00:13:19,083 --> 00:13:20,416
Don't waste any time.

302
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:31,125
An <i>uchigatana</i> , a <i>tantou</i> ,
and four <i>tachis</i> this time.

303
00:13:31,208 --> 00:13:33,000
I don't think I've ever
seen a team composition

304
00:13:33,083 --> 00:13:34,250
like this before.

305
00:13:34,333 --> 00:13:35,541
Any comments, Captain?

306
00:13:35,625 --> 00:13:37,125
If the master
wants to get creative,

307
00:13:37,208 --> 00:13:39,583
then I'll do my best
to accommodate that.

308
00:13:39,666 --> 00:13:40,625
I'm not worried.

309
00:13:40,708 --> 00:13:42,791
I know you'll take care of us.

310
00:13:42,875 --> 00:13:45,125
I'm honored to battle beside
one of the Five Great Swords

311
00:13:45,208 --> 00:13:46,000
of Japan.

312
00:13:46,083 --> 00:13:47,541
So give us a good show!

313
00:13:47,625 --> 00:13:49,083
[MIKAZUKI laughs]

314
00:13:49,166 --> 00:13:52,000
We'll see if this old man
has any tricks left in him.

315
00:13:54,666 --> 00:13:56,791
Is that festival music?

316
00:13:56,875 --> 00:13:58,666
[YASUSADA]
I don't hear anything.

317
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:00,416
You must have good ears, huh?

318
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:01,833
I am a wild beast.

319
00:14:03,833 --> 00:14:04,916
[gunshot]

320
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,041
That's gunfire.

321
00:14:06,125 --> 00:14:07,083
[gunshot]

322
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:12,500
I do like a surprise,
even if it comes during battle.

As long as I survive, that is.

I'll be fine.

Sadly, I can't say the same for
the comb the master gave me.

We've got some surprises
lined up for them too, right?

00:14:33,958 --> 00:14:35,083
I hope so.

331
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:37,875
We have to earn our

What's up?

It's Kogitsunemaru.

340
00:15:00,541 --> 00:15:02,750
I fear his lack of
real combat experience

341
00:15:02,833 --> 00:15:04,583
may place him in danger.

342

[TSURUMARU]
No problem.

343

Ichigo and Yagen are handling
it, so I'm sure it's fine.

I hope this isn't a bad omen.

Ichigo can handle things.

He's got Yagen with him too.

Strange how everything fits,
but I'm not complaining.

It's nice that we've
been able to rest for a bit,

Wow. You're a celebrity!

397
00:18:47,125 --> 00:18:48,375
How does it go?

398
00:18:48,458 --> 00:18:50,000
Must be about a fox, huh?

399
00:18:51,958 --> 00:18:54,583
[MIKAZUKI] Emperor Ichijou
had a mysterious dream,

400
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:56,541
urging him to forge a blade,

401
00:18:56,625 --> 00:18:59,333
so he sent his envoy
to the famous swordsmith,

402
00:18:59,416 --> 00:19:00,833
Sanjou Munechika,

403
00:19:00,916 --> 00:19:02,583
in hopes that he
could do the job.

404
00:19:02,666 --> 00:19:05,333
However, the sword of
dreams was not something

405
00:19:05,416 --> 00:19:07,958
Munechika could
craft on his own.

406
00:19:08,041 --> 00:19:10,375
Therefore, the troubled
swordsmith sought help

407
00:19:10,458 --> 00:19:13,000
from the great god Inari.

408
00:19:13,083 --> 00:19:15,916
Upon hearing the pleas
of Sanjou Munechika,

409
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,125
the god took the form of
a white fox and appeared

410
00:19:19,208 --> 00:19:22,250
before him to
assist in his work.

411
00:19:22,333 --> 00:19:25,500
And so, with
the god at his side,

412
00:19:25,583 --> 00:19:27,625
the master blacksmith
forged a sword

413
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:29,666
worthy of the emperor's dream.

414
00:19:34,291 --> 00:19:37,875
[MIKAZUKI] And that is our
dear friend, Kogitsunemaru.

415
00:19:37,958 --> 00:19:40,666
This tale has been passed
on throughout the ages

416
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:42,708
and is even known
during the master's time,

you're correct in saying

It's no surprise that he's
become such a powerful sword,

like a superstar.

that the entire world shares.
