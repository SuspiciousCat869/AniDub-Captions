00:00:09,708 --> 00:00:12,333
[YAGEN]
The year is 2205 AD.

2
00:00:16,708 --> 00:00:19,791
The History Retrograde Army
seeks to control the world

3
00:00:19,875 --> 00:00:21,625
by altering its past.

4
00:00:23,333 --> 00:00:25,041
Born from the heart of swords,

5
00:00:25,125 --> 00:00:28,458
we travel through time to
intercept and eliminate them.

6
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:32,250
Except when we go to the beach.

00:02:03,625 --> 00:02:05,208
[KASHUU, YASUSADA]
This is a tale of the legendary

8
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:07,666
Sword Warriors
and the Hanamaru days

9
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:10,541
they spent in
a certain citadel.

10
00:02:18,833 --> 00:02:20,166
[YASUSADA sighs]

11
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:21,750
When we start the day with
an easy mission like that,

12
00:02:21,833 --> 00:02:23,708
it feels just like
a morning workout.

13
00:02:23,791 --> 00:02:25,250
What's that smell?

14
00:02:27,625 --> 00:02:28,833
Stop it.

15
00:02:28,916 --> 00:02:30,666
Smells nice, whatever it is.

16
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:33,041
[chuckles]
You've got a good nose.

17
00:02:33,125 --> 00:02:34,291
It's this.

18
00:02:34,375 --> 00:02:37,541
I put some herbs in this
protection charm I made.

19
00:02:37,625 --> 00:02:41,291
I asked the master
and they gave me some.

20
00:02:41,375 --> 00:02:42,708
[KASHUU]
Wait...

21
00:02:42,791 --> 00:02:45,291
Is this that stuff that
Hasebe's watering all the time?

22
00:02:45,375 --> 00:02:46,500
[YASUSADA]
Yep!

23
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:49,041
And my charm is the
only one that has it!

24
00:02:49,125 --> 00:02:51,250
What? That's totally not fair!

25
00:02:51,333 --> 00:02:55,125
[sniffing]

26
00:02:55,208 --> 00:02:56,458
Stop sniffing!

27
00:02:56,541 --> 00:02:58,500
Don't be so stingy!
It might give me good luck!

28
00:03:02,458 --> 00:03:05,000
I have raised the master's
herbs with dignity.

29
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:08,625
What should I put in my charm?

30
00:03:08,708 --> 00:03:10,708
Oh, I didn't realize
you made one too.

31
00:03:10,791 --> 00:03:13,500
It's the next big thing;
of course I'm on top of it.

32
00:03:13,583 --> 00:03:14,666
Go figure.

33
00:03:19,208 --> 00:03:20,291
[KASHUU] You picked out
something that makes

34
00:03:20,375 --> 00:03:21,625
you happy, right?

35
00:03:21,708 --> 00:03:23,458
I wonder what everyone
else is putting in theirs.

36
00:03:30,833 --> 00:03:33,000
Whoa! They're intense!

37
00:03:33,083 --> 00:03:35,125
Uh, what's up?

38
00:03:35,208 --> 00:03:37,625
I'm gazing upon
this tiny flower,

39
00:03:37,708 --> 00:03:40,625
searing its image
into my memory.

40
00:03:40,708 --> 00:03:43,500
Sayo woke up early to pick
a flower for his brother

41
00:03:43,583 --> 00:03:45,125
and it seems that it's a hit.

42
00:03:45,208 --> 00:03:46,166
Lovely.

43
00:03:51,125 --> 00:03:52,458
[YASUSADA]
Now that Kousetsu has arrived,

44
00:03:52,541 --> 00:03:54,625
all three brothers
are finally together.

45
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:58,750
[YASUSADA]
Sayo looks happy.

46
00:03:58,833 --> 00:03:59,916
I think.

47
00:04:02,083 --> 00:04:03,416
[grunting]

48
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:05,166
All right, now keep it up!

49
00:04:06,583 --> 00:04:08,750
[NAKIGITSUNE] They're looking
stronger every day, huh?

50
00:04:08,833 --> 00:04:09,958
Thanks to Yagen.

51
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:12,125
He's been working them
pretty hard lately.

52
00:04:12,208 --> 00:04:14,000
[HONEBAMI]
They're getting serious.

53
00:04:14,083 --> 00:04:15,500
And again!

54
00:04:15,583 --> 00:04:17,375
[YAGEN] They're finally starting
to build some confidence.

55
00:04:18,833 --> 00:04:20,958
Yagen! Time for us to go!

56
00:04:21,041 --> 00:04:24,208
Sorry, guess I lost
track of the time.

but we're going
to the beach today!

67
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:52,916
The master really
outdid themselves

68
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,125
on these handmade
swimsuits, huh?

69
00:04:55,208 --> 00:04:57,541
[ATSUSHI] I'm just glad
you got the loincloth.

70
00:04:57,625 --> 00:04:59,708
[MUTSUNOKAMI] No one else
could rock this and you know it.

71
00:05:00,916 --> 00:05:03,208
Hey. Who's that with the turtle?

72
00:05:03,291 --> 00:05:05,708
[laughs]
I'm Urashima Kotetsu.

73
00:05:05,791 --> 00:05:07,666
And this turtle is
really a prince,

74
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:09,416
but his palace is under the sea!

75

[MUTSUNOKAMI laughs]

76
00:05:10,958 --> 00:05:12,541
What is that, a fairy tale?

00:05:12,625 --> 00:05:14,583
I don't get it,
but you're funny!

78
00:05:14,666 --> 00:05:15,833
Glad you're here.

79
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:18,375
All joking aside,
I'm glad I could make it.

80
00:05:18,458 --> 00:05:19,875
[NAKIGITSUNE]
Watch out for that one.

Right.

00:05:21,125 --> 00:05:23,041
The master put this
whole trip together.

00:05:23,125 --> 00:05:26,000
So let's tell them
thank you before we go!

they wanna say to you.

Are you kidding me?

What is your problem?

90
00:05:37,041 --> 00:05:39,333
The master is trying
to do research and--

91
00:05:39,416 --> 00:05:41,541
One at a time, okay, guys?

92
00:05:41,625 --> 00:05:43,500
Wait, the master is studying?

93
00:05:43,583 --> 00:05:45,458
So they're not coming with us?

94
00:05:45,541 --> 00:05:48,375
[HASEBE] I told you, the master
is a stay-at-home type,

95
00:05:48,458 --> 00:05:50,125
not a great outdoors type.

96
00:05:50,208 --> 00:05:51,375
Now get going.

What're we waiting for?

[laughs]

104
00:06:10,375 --> 00:06:12,791
Okay, the first one to reach
the water is the sharpest sword

105

110
00:06:22,666 --> 00:06:24,583
They've got some energy, huh?

[YASUSADA gasps]

112
00:06:27,708 --> 00:06:29,083
Sunburn is my enemy.

113
00:06:29,166 --> 00:06:31,041
Then why the heck did
you come to the beach?

114
00:06:31,125 --> 00:06:33,250
To keep you company, of course!

115
00:06:33,333 --> 00:06:36,291
You'd be lonely
without me, right?

116
00:06:36,375 --> 00:06:37,375
Yeah...

117
00:06:37,458 --> 00:06:38,916
Well, thanks for
the sentiment, I guess,

118
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,500
but I think I'm going swimming.

119
00:06:41,583 --> 00:06:42,375
And so are you!

120
00:06:42,458 --> 00:06:43,458
[KASHUU]
Wait!

121
00:06:43,541 --> 00:06:45,458
At least let me put
on my sunscreen!

122
00:06:45,541 --> 00:06:47,041
[YASUSADA]
Woohoo!

Five.

[GOKOTAI]
Six!

128
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,083

Sea water tastes funny.

129
00:06:59,166 --> 00:07:00,125
Like what?

130
00:07:02,333 --> 00:07:08,750
I dunno. Try.

131
00:07:08,833 --> 00:07:12,333
[AKITA] It tastes like...
something. That's for sure.

132
00:07:12,416 --> 00:07:14,541
[HIRANO] That was gross,
but I want to try it again

133
00:07:14,625 --> 00:07:15,833
for some reason.

134
00:07:15,916 --> 00:07:18,583
[groaning]

135
00:07:19,791 --> 00:07:21,375
[MUTSUNOKAMI] I'm swimming
all the way to that island

136
00:07:21,458 --> 00:07:22,833
and you can't stop me!

00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,625
It's the ocean!

141
00:07:31,708 --> 00:07:35,083
[laughs] Don't you want
to go swimming?

142
00:07:35,166 --> 00:07:38,291
Oh, you want to return to
the Sea Dragon's Palace?

143
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:39,666
That's so cool!

144
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:41,875
I wish I could talk to
turtles like you, Urashima!

145
00:07:41,958 --> 00:07:43,041
[URASHIMA]
Well, I talk,

146
00:07:43,125 --> 00:07:44,833
but that doesn't mean
he understands me.

147
00:07:44,916 --> 00:07:46,416
Hey, come back here!

148
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,041
Don't leave for real!

149

[MIDARE] Wow, what
a cute little seashell!

150
00:07:50,625 --> 00:07:53,375
I should grab a bunch of
them and make a necklace.

151

[YAGEN]
Look, Midare.

152
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,500
A touch from this starfish
works as an anesthetic!

153
00:07:58,583 --> 00:08:00,166
One sting and you'll go numb!

154
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:01,583
I should take some back!

155
00:08:01,666 --> 00:08:02,958
[MIDARE]
You're creeping me out!

156
00:08:03,041 --> 00:08:04,250
No! Stop it!

157
00:08:04,333 --> 00:08:05,416
Get it away!

158
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:06,708
Atsushi, help!

159
00:08:06,791 --> 00:08:07,875
So good!

160
00:08:07,958 --> 00:08:09,791
I just wish I had
brought some soy sauce!

161
00:08:09,875 --> 00:08:12,708
[HAKATA] I can make
a killing off these!

162
00:08:12,791 --> 00:08:15,250
Ah, I'd give you guys a
good discount, of course.

00:08:15,333 --> 00:08:17,500
Why don't you try
having fun for once?

164
00:08:19,458 --> 00:08:22,083
[SOUZA] I never thought I
would get to see the ocean.

165
00:08:22,166 --> 00:08:24,416
I was a bird in a cage,
after all.

166
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:27,125
My former master only
thought of me as decoration.

167
00:08:27,208 --> 00:08:28,708
He'd never take me anywhere.

168
00:08:28,791 --> 00:08:31,125
Seems even a beautiful
day like this can't erase

169
00:08:31,208 --> 00:08:33,750
the endless melancholy
tugging at our hearts.

170
00:08:36,416 --> 00:08:38,458
[SAYO] Do you think
Kousetsu's having fun?

171
00:08:38,541 --> 00:08:40,416
[SOUZA]
Actually, I have no idea.

172
00:08:43,958 --> 00:08:45,625
[NAMAZUO] Mutsunokami
said we should make lots

173
00:08:45,708 --> 00:08:46,666
of memories today,

174
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:48,958
so I wanna try
all sorts of stuff.

175
00:08:49,041 --> 00:08:50,208
Memories, huh?

176
00:08:50,291 --> 00:08:51,791
I don't have any.

177
00:08:51,875 --> 00:08:53,416
You can still make some though.

178
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,458
Even if you have none.

179
00:08:55,541 --> 00:08:57,416
And once you've made
some good memories,

180
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,458
you won't need to
worry about the past.

181
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:02,833
[NAMAZUO]
Okay, the tunnel's done.

182
00:09:02,916 --> 00:09:03,625
Now shake!

183
00:09:03,708 --> 00:09:05,375
[laughing]

184
00:09:05,458 --> 00:09:07,166
[chuckles] Your hand
feels funny, Honebami.

185
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:08,666
My hands are here.

186
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:10,000
I'm not touching you.

187
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:15,291
Then what the heck is
grabbing my finger right now?

188
00:09:15,375 --> 00:09:17,458
[NAMAZUO yelling]

189
00:09:17,541 --> 00:09:18,916
[URASHIMA]
Kamekichi!

190
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,375
[YASUSADA]
I wonder...

191
00:09:21,458 --> 00:09:23,333
You think the Shinsengumi
ever hung out at the beach?

192
00:09:23,416 --> 00:09:24,708
Are you kidding?

193
00:09:24,791 --> 00:09:26,875
What if the anti-shogunate
faction caught them all

194
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:28,583
playing around in the water?

195
00:09:28,666 --> 00:09:30,291
Those were crazy times.

196
00:09:30,375 --> 00:09:31,750
I guess they were, huh?

197
00:09:34,625 --> 00:09:36,791
Darn it, I just
dropped my sunscreen!

198
00:09:36,875 --> 00:09:38,125
Well too bad.

199
00:09:38,208 --> 00:09:40,125
You wouldn't mind fetching
it for me, would you?

200
00:09:40,208 --> 00:09:41,916
A little water won't hurt you.

201
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,375
Ugh...

202
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:45,458
Souji would help me
if he were here.

203
00:09:45,541 --> 00:09:47,958
There's no one decent
left in this world.

204
00:09:48,041 --> 00:09:48,791
Fine.

205
00:09:48,875 --> 00:09:50,666
I know what Souji would do.

206
00:09:52,375 --> 00:09:53,750
[YASUSADA]
He'd strike in an instant!

207
00:09:53,833 --> 00:09:55,000
A surprise attack!

208
00:10:00,625 --> 00:10:01,833
[YASUSADA]
You want a souvenir?

209
00:10:02,875 --> 00:10:03,833
What is it?

210
00:10:03,916 --> 00:10:05,541
Just look.

211
00:10:05,625 --> 00:10:06,625
Take it.

212
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:10,000
Huh?

213
00:10:18,708 --> 00:10:19,625
Hi, there.

214
00:10:19,708 --> 00:10:20,708
Would you like some tea?

215
00:10:20,791 --> 00:10:22,916
Oh. That would be
so great, thanks.

216
00:10:29,958 --> 00:10:31,916
That's much nicer
than sea water.

217
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:36,250
How sweet. Sayo is cheering up.

218
00:10:44,041 --> 00:10:46,333
Those brothers make
a great team, huh?

219
00:10:56,833 --> 00:10:58,041
Guys, wake up!

220
00:10:59,708 --> 00:11:02,041
I know! I brought
some watermelon for us!

221
00:11:02,125 --> 00:11:03,041
Do you guys want some?

222
00:11:03,125 --> 00:11:04,375
Oh, sure.

223
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:06,666
[camera shutter clicks]

224
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:09,125
Are all you short swords
having fun over here?

225
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:12,750
Uh... Did I say
something wrong?

226
00:11:18,291 --> 00:11:21,416
[NAKIGITSUNE] Did everyone
have a good time at the beach?

227
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,333
[YAGEN]
Yeah, I guess.

228
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:24,958
No, it was a lot of fun.

229
00:11:25,041 --> 00:11:27,000
I'm writing about the trip
in my journal today

230
00:11:27,083 --> 00:11:28,833
so Ichi can read
about what happened,

231
00:11:28,916 --> 00:11:31,375
even though he didn't get
the chance to come with us.

232
00:11:31,458 --> 00:11:32,208
I'm done.

233
00:11:32,291 --> 00:11:33,750
Isn't it so cute?

234
00:11:33,833 --> 00:11:36,500
It's more my style, but I'll
give it to Ichi once he's here.

235
00:11:36,583 --> 00:11:38,875
[HIRANO chuckles] I collected
some star sand for him.

236
00:11:40,208 --> 00:11:42,125
It's not that we didn't
have a good time.

237
00:11:42,208 --> 00:11:43,833
It's just that we wish
we could have shared it

238
00:11:43,916 --> 00:11:46,041
with our brother Ichi.

239
00:11:46,125 --> 00:11:48,375
I see.

240
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:49,916
[YAGEN] I know they're
really missing him,

241
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,333
but doing this is better
than keeping their feelings

242
00:11:52,416 --> 00:11:53,541
bottled up.

243
00:12:45,666 --> 00:12:46,833
It's okay.

244
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:52,041
[YASUSADA]
Are you awake?

245
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:54,666
I am now.

246
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:56,750
There's still no Ichigo.

247
00:12:56,833 --> 00:12:59,166
Wonder what's taking so long.

248
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:01,416
It's hard to say.

249
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:03,833
At any rate, I hope
he shows up soon.

250
00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:06,958
All the Awataguchi swords
really seem to miss him a lot.

251
00:13:10,166 --> 00:13:12,166
[YASUSADA] I can't even
imagine what that feels like.

252
00:13:20,666 --> 00:13:23,958
[YASUSADA] Still, I hate to see
them dwell on it and suffer.

253
00:13:24,041 --> 00:13:25,333
[KASHUU]
They're fine.

254
00:13:25,416 --> 00:13:26,916
[YASUSADA]
Huh?

255
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,666
[KASHUU] Because having someone
to care about is a good thing.

256
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:32,875
Even if it hurts now,
it's only because

257
00:13:32,958 --> 00:13:35,458
they love Ichigo so much.

258
00:13:35,541 --> 00:13:36,791
One day, when he's here,

259
00:13:36,875 --> 00:13:39,541
even their loneliness will
become a happy memory.

260
00:13:42,541 --> 00:13:44,166
[KASHUU]
It was the same for me.

261
00:13:45,625 --> 00:13:47,250
[KASHUU]
Now, goodnight.

262
00:14:06,541 --> 00:14:07,916
[NAKIGITSUNE]
Yagen.

263
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,625
We received a talisman
imbued with strong powers

264
00:14:10,708 --> 00:14:11,916
from the master.

265
00:14:14,375 --> 00:14:15,333
[NAKIGITSUNE]
Come.

266
00:14:17,583 --> 00:14:19,625
[ICHIGO]
I am Ichigo Hitofuri,

267
00:14:19,708 --> 00:14:24,000
the only <i>tachi</i> made by the
great Awataguchi Yoshimitsu.

268
00:14:24,083 --> 00:14:27,583
Master, I will do my utmost
to fulfill my duties to you

269
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:30,125
and to the citadel alike.

270
00:14:30,208 --> 00:14:33,000
Understood.
I'm pleased to be here.

271
00:14:40,291 --> 00:14:42,375
[YAGEN]
Ichi, it's you.

272
00:14:43,833 --> 00:14:46,708
So we finally meet,
Yagen Toushiro.

273
00:14:46,791 --> 00:14:48,625
Hello, Brother.

274
00:14:51,208 --> 00:14:53,833
Hang on and I'll attach
your bell for you.

275
00:14:53,916 --> 00:14:55,208
Oh, thank you.

276
00:14:58,916 --> 00:15:01,250
There's a nice spot here
that I'd like to show you.

277
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:02,375
Do you mind going?

278
00:15:03,958 --> 00:15:05,250
A nice spot?

279
00:15:14,125 --> 00:15:15,333
[YAGEN]
Take a seat.

280
00:15:15,416 --> 00:15:18,541
This is the best view
in the whole citadel.

281
00:15:18,625 --> 00:15:19,958
[ICHIGO]
Is that so?

282
00:15:20,041 --> 00:15:21,916
I see.

283
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,875
The wind sure feels nice.

284
00:15:23,958 --> 00:15:25,500
It's a pretty big place.

285
00:15:25,583 --> 00:15:28,375
They have an outdoor bath
and a laundry room, too.

286
00:15:28,458 --> 00:15:30,041
The fields are right over there.

287
00:15:30,125 --> 00:15:31,583
That building is
the training hall,

288
00:15:31,666 --> 00:15:34,125
where we practice
sparring every day.

289
00:15:34,208 --> 00:15:36,916
Our brothers have all
gotten pretty strong.

290
00:15:39,791 --> 00:15:41,250
[ICHIGO]
I like the cherry tree.

291
00:15:41,333 --> 00:15:42,625
Very impressive.

292
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:43,791
[YAGEN]
I agree.

293
00:15:43,875 --> 00:15:45,916
It's like the symbol
of the citadel.

294
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,250
We actually didn't know
what kind of tree it was,

295
00:15:48,333 --> 00:15:51,500
until one day it was covered
in cherry blossoms.

296
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:53,125
It was quite the sight.

297
00:15:54,333 --> 00:15:57,041
We can see it together
the next time it blooms.

298
00:15:57,125 --> 00:15:58,375
Sounds lovely.

299
00:16:00,041 --> 00:16:01,833
Yagen, what's that
little pouch you have

300
00:16:01,916 --> 00:16:03,166
hanging around your neck?

301
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:04,916
Oh, this thing?

302
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,333
They're sort of like
a trend among the swords.

303
00:16:07,416 --> 00:16:09,291
It's a handmade
protection charm.

304
00:16:11,041 --> 00:16:12,125
Interesting.

305
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:14,666
May I see it?

306
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:16,833
[YAGEN] They say the
cherry tree grants any wish

307
00:16:16,916 --> 00:16:18,458
you hang on its branches.

308
00:16:21,625 --> 00:16:23,541
[YAGEN] I don't know who
wrote that one in particular,

309
00:16:23,625 --> 00:16:25,833
but there were a whole ton
of them just like that,

310
00:16:25,916 --> 00:16:29,166
covering the tree
like cherry blossoms.

311
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:31,791
They said things like,
"I hope Ichi comes here soon,"

312
00:16:31,875 --> 00:16:34,666
or "I want to be strong
by the time Ichi gets here."

313
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:37,250
Even "I want to
play games with Ichi."

314
00:16:37,333 --> 00:16:39,208
All your little brothers
just wrote about

315
00:16:39,291 --> 00:16:41,125
how much they wanted to see you.

316
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:46,166
And you wanted all those
wishes to come true,

317
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:48,416
so you turned them
into protection charms?

318
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:49,541
Not exactly.

319
00:16:49,625 --> 00:16:51,458
I mostly did it for
the other swords.

320
00:16:52,208 --> 00:16:53,666
[ICHIGO]
I see.

321
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:56,458
Then you've been taking care
of our brothers in my absence.

322
00:16:56,541 --> 00:16:57,625
Thank you, Yagen.

323
00:16:59,166 --> 00:17:02,250
[YAGEN] Nakigitsune, Namazuo,
and Honehbami helped too.

324
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:04,791
Well...

325
00:17:04,875 --> 00:17:06,583
It must have been
hard on all of you.

326
00:17:09,625 --> 00:17:11,041
[ICHIGO]
I'm so proud.

327
00:17:13,583 --> 00:17:16,000
Stop that! I'm an adult!

328
00:17:21,166 --> 00:17:22,791
[YAGEN]
You're lucky, by the way.

329
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:25,208
Even the moon is
happy to see you.

330
00:17:25,291 --> 00:17:28,041
I think it's the most
beautiful one we've had yet.

331
00:17:54,166 --> 00:17:57,125
[ICHIGO] I know that you've
suffered waiting for me.

332
00:17:57,208 --> 00:17:59,541
It pains me to even think of it.

333
00:17:59,625 --> 00:18:01,833
I promise to make
it up to all of you.

334
00:18:06,916 --> 00:18:08,583
I know that crest!

335
00:18:08,666 --> 00:18:09,916
It's Ichi's!

336
00:18:11,333 --> 00:18:13,958
[excited chatter]

337
00:18:14,041 --> 00:18:16,125
[NAMAZUO]
Is Ichi here or not?

338
00:18:16,208 --> 00:18:17,541
[ALL]
Yeah!

339
00:18:17,625 --> 00:18:18,416
Where is he?

340
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:19,750
Let us see him!

341
00:18:19,833 --> 00:18:21,291
[GOKOTAI] We--We've waited
long enough, haven't we?

342
00:18:21,375 --> 00:18:22,791
He'll be here soon, okay?

343
00:18:22,875 --> 00:18:23,916
Just calm down.

344
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,416
[HAKATA]
All right, but how soon?

345
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,458
[ATSUSHI] We should all
hide before Ichi gets here.

346
00:18:27,541 --> 00:18:29,916
Then we'll jump out,
and try to scare him!

347
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,958
[chattering]

348
00:18:32,041 --> 00:18:33,375
[MAEDA]
Guys, that's him!

349
00:18:33,458 --> 00:18:35,041
[AKITA, GOKOTAI, HIRANO]
He's here, he's here, he's here!

350
00:18:37,875 --> 00:18:38,833
Gah!

351
00:18:38,916 --> 00:18:40,625
Whoa, jeez,
where'd you come from?

352
00:18:40,708 --> 00:18:42,833
[ALL apologizing]

353
00:18:42,916 --> 00:18:44,958
It's rare for anything
to surprise me,

354
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:47,041
but hey, life's no fun
if you can't mix it up

355
00:18:47,125 --> 00:18:48,416
from time to time!

356
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:50,125
[HIRANO]
We apologize, Tsurumaru,

357
00:18:50,208 --> 00:18:51,708
we thought you
were someone else.

358
00:18:51,791 --> 00:18:52,416
[TSURUMARU]
Oh?

359
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:54,000
Yeah, like who?

360
00:18:54,083 --> 00:18:55,000
Like Ichi!

361
00:18:55,083 --> 00:18:56,458
And he's right over there!

362
00:18:59,291 --> 00:19:00,458
[GROUP]
It is Ichi!

363
00:19:00,541 --> 00:19:02,500
[overlapping chatter]

364
00:19:03,208 --> 00:19:04,375
[MAEDA]
Ichi!

365
00:19:04,458 --> 00:19:07,208
[laughs] And I thought
I was surprised before!

366
00:19:14,333 --> 00:19:15,625
[ALL]
Ichi!

367
00:19:15,708 --> 00:19:17,541
[laughing]

368
00:19:19,916 --> 00:19:21,833
[chattering]

369
00:19:25,416 --> 00:19:27,041
I'm sorry I didn't
say hello sooner,

370
00:19:27,125 --> 00:19:29,458
but I was busy
building this for us.

371
00:19:29,541 --> 00:19:30,750
[ALL gasp]

372
00:19:30,833 --> 00:19:33,375
[overlapping chatter]

373
00:19:33,458 --> 00:19:35,166
Can I ride on it
with you, Ichi?

374
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:37,250
[ALL]
Me, too!

375
00:19:37,333 --> 00:19:39,375
[ICHIGO laughs]
Of course you can.

376
00:19:39,458 --> 00:19:41,166
Just not all of you at once.

377
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:42,041
[NAMAZUO]
Don't worry.

378
00:19:42,125 --> 00:19:43,625
If Ichi holds on, we'll be fine.

379
00:19:43,708 --> 00:19:45,166
--[MIDARE] Let's go!
--[HAKATA] Hugs first?

380
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:47,208
[ALL laughing]

381
00:19:49,083 --> 00:19:51,666
Come on, Yagen, you
have to ride it with us too!

382
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:53,458
No, I'm fine watching.

383
00:19:53,541 --> 00:19:54,833
Don't be like that!

384
00:19:54,916 --> 00:19:56,000
Get on!

385
00:19:56,083 --> 00:19:57,875
Don't just stand there!
We're all waiting!

386
00:19:57,958 --> 00:19:59,500
[NAMAZUO]
We won't take no for an answer.

387
00:19:59,583 --> 00:20:01,208
All right, fine.

388
00:20:01,291 --> 00:20:03,791
Get ready! Here goes!

389
00:20:04,958 --> 00:20:06,583
[ALL]
Yay!

390
00:20:07,583 --> 00:20:10,791
[ALL laughing]

391
00:20:12,541 --> 00:20:13,625
[ALL yelling]

392
00:20:15,541 --> 00:20:18,500
[ALL laughing]

393
00:20:33,583 --> 00:20:34,833
[MIDARE]
The swing was fun and all,

394
00:20:34,916 --> 00:20:37,208
but we should throw a
welcoming party for Ichi!

395
00:20:37,291 --> 00:20:38,625
[overlapping chatter]

396
00:20:38,708 --> 00:20:40,541
[NAMAZUO] Okay, cool!
It's settled, then!

397
00:20:41,083 --> 00:20:42,000
Count me in.

398
00:20:42,083 --> 00:20:43,833
Okay, but what's the plan?

399
00:20:43,916 --> 00:20:45,958
Anything you wanna do, Ichi?

400
00:20:46,041 --> 00:20:48,041
As long as we're all
together, I'm happy.

401
00:20:48,125 --> 00:20:50,125
You should do whatever
you think is fun.

402
00:20:50,208 --> 00:20:51,416
[YASUSADA]
How 'bout this?

403
00:20:52,375 --> 00:20:54,875
We should form a music group!

404
00:20:54,958 --> 00:20:56,041
Here, look!

405
00:20:56,125 --> 00:20:57,541
I saw this in one of
Master's magazines.

406
00:20:57,625 --> 00:20:59,083
We can do that, right?

407
00:20:59,166 --> 00:21:00,500
[AKITA]
They're so fancy! Wow!

408
00:21:00,583 --> 00:21:01,833
[GOKOTAI]
Oh! They look super neat!

409
00:21:01,916 --> 00:21:03,375
[HAKATA]
Are they really musicians?

410
00:21:03,458 --> 00:21:05,000
[YASUSADA] Don't get
hung up on the music part.

411
00:21:05,083 --> 00:21:07,916
As long as we sing, dance
and look cute, we're good.

412
00:21:09,875 --> 00:21:11,208
[squeals]

413
00:21:11,291 --> 00:21:12,708
Let's do it!

414
00:21:13,791 --> 00:21:15,083
I wanna be cute!

415
00:21:15,166 --> 00:21:16,750
Singing is cool, too!

416
00:21:16,833 --> 00:21:18,500
Then how 'bout
we put on a concert

417
00:21:18,583 --> 00:21:21,250
for Ichi's welcoming party!

418
00:21:21,333 --> 00:21:22,333
Hey!

419
00:21:22,416 --> 00:21:24,000
We need a name
for the group, right?

420
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:26,875
We're the Awataguchi swords,
so how about "Awata 48,"

421
00:21:26,958 --> 00:21:28,291
like the girls in that book?

422
00:21:31,083 --> 00:21:34,125
[ALL] I don't get the 48 part,
but it sounds cool.

423
00:21:34,208 --> 00:21:35,833
[chattering]

424
00:21:35,916 --> 00:21:37,375
[YASUSADA]
One other thing.

425
00:21:37,458 --> 00:21:40,083
The article says that groups
like this need a producer, too.

426
00:21:40,166 --> 00:21:41,875
[ALL]
A producer?

427
00:21:41,958 --> 00:21:44,125
Since I have a feeling
he's not much of a singer,

428
00:21:44,208 --> 00:21:46,083
I know just the
sword for the job.

429
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:52,000
And naturally, I'll be
performing in the middle

430
00:21:52,083 --> 00:21:52,916
of the stage.

431
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,083
Making me the "center"!

432
00:21:54,166 --> 00:21:55,750
Oh, then I should be
the center for sure!

433
00:21:55,833 --> 00:21:57,416
That sounds like
just the job for me!

434
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:59,208
I was born to be
the center, you guys!

435
00:21:59,291 --> 00:22:00,083
[MIDARE]
Nuh-uh!

436
00:22:00,166 --> 00:22:00,875
[NAMAZUO]
'Cause I was!

437
00:22:00,958 --> 00:22:01,791
[GOKOTAI]
M-Me, too!

438
00:22:01,875 --> 00:22:03,458
[MAEDA]
I want to be center too.

439
00:22:03,541 --> 00:22:05,750
[YASUSADA] Then we'll have
to let the producer decide.

440
00:22:05,833 --> 00:22:07,708
That way there's
no hard feelings.

441
00:22:07,791 --> 00:22:10,458
Mr. Producer,
your answer, please?

442
00:22:10,541 --> 00:22:12,541
Too much pressure;
let's do a roulette.

443
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,291
And the center is...

444
00:23:52,791 --> 00:23:53,916
[yelling]

445
00:23:57,250 --> 00:23:58,958
The Ikedaya Inn again?

446
00:23:59,916 --> 00:24:01,875
It's Awata 48.

447
00:24:01,958 --> 00:24:03,625
Go back to sleep already.
