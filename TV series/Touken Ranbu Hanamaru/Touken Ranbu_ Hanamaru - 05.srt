00:08:41,791 --> 00:08:44,083
revered master of
the tea ceremony!

163
00:08:44,166 --> 00:08:48,416
Even Nobunaga praised his
elegance and creativity!

164
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:51,166
[KASEN] Perhaps it's a bit too
much elegance right off the bat.

165
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:53,000
I should have warmed
them up a bit first.

166
00:08:54,708 --> 00:08:57,583
The most important part of
the ceremony is still the tea.

167
00:08:57,666 --> 00:09:00,166
My presentation was
a bit avant-garde.

168
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:01,916
Let's stick to the basics,
shall we?

169
00:09:03,166 --> 00:09:06,041
I'm confident that you will
enjoy its refined flavor.

170
00:09:11,583 --> 00:09:13,416
[KASEN]
It's not for you.

171
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,291
[YAGEN] Lord Nobunaga
was actually a master

172
00:09:15,375 --> 00:09:16,458
of hospitality.

173
00:09:16,541 --> 00:09:18,625
He would offer his
guests unusual fruits

174
00:09:18,708 --> 00:09:20,750
gathered from all
over the world.

175
00:09:20,833 --> 00:09:22,250
[ALL]
Whoa!

176
00:09:22,333 --> 00:09:24,041
[YAGEN]
Now please, indulge.

177
00:09:24,125 --> 00:09:25,333
[ALL]
In what?

178
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,500
I suppose it's my turn now, huh?

179
00:09:40,708 --> 00:09:42,666
[YAMANBAGIRI] I thought I could
entertain him with a funny story

180
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:44,125
or something,

181
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:46,416
but that's obviously
not going to happen.

182
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,666
What'd they expect
from a copy like me?

183
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:50,375
Crap, this is getting awkward.

184
00:09:50,458 --> 00:09:52,250
Say something clever,
damn it! Hurry!

185
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:54,291
He's acting weird.

186
00:09:54,375 --> 00:09:55,625
Is he okay?

187
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:02,500
[NAKIGITSUNE] They say that
animals have the ability

188
00:10:02,583 --> 00:10:04,291
to heal your spirit.

189
00:10:04,375 --> 00:10:06,250
You're not allergic
to foxes, are you?

190
00:10:06,333 --> 00:10:07,750
I hope not.

191
00:10:07,833 --> 00:10:09,166
[NAKIGITSUNE] Give my tail
a pet and see if it makes you

192
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:10,291
feel any better.

193
00:10:13,708 --> 00:10:14,541
So fluffy.

194
00:10:14,625 --> 00:10:16,125
[koto music]

195
00:10:17,708 --> 00:10:18,916
I know that sound.

196
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,166
[koto continues]

197
00:10:23,833 --> 00:10:25,125
[TSURUMARU laughs]

198
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:27,708
I'm sorry, I'm not good
enough to play a whole song.

199
00:10:27,791 --> 00:10:30,250
Masamune's wife played
the koto, didn't she?

200
00:10:30,333 --> 00:10:33,666
I thought maybe you heard it
in the time you spent with them.

201
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:36,541
[koto music]

202
00:10:36,625 --> 00:10:37,666
I like it.

203
00:10:40,666 --> 00:10:42,208
It's a nice sound.

204
00:10:42,291 --> 00:10:43,833
One filled with kindness.

205
00:10:44,833 --> 00:10:46,125
He's smiling!

206
00:10:46,208 --> 00:10:47,166
Yeah.

207
00:10:56,541 --> 00:10:58,208
[OOKURIKARA]
Just like Lord Masamune.

208
00:11:05,083 --> 00:11:07,791
[SHOKUDAIKIRI] One who has not
experienced the joy of cooking

209
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:10,458
is the owner of a poor heart.

210
00:11:10,541 --> 00:11:15,333
There is no greater hospitality
than a meal, lovingly prepared.

211
00:11:15,416 --> 00:11:17,333
I hope that it's to your liking.

212
00:11:25,375 --> 00:11:26,833
I see.

213
00:11:26,916 --> 00:11:29,208
So this is the
flavor of kindness.

214
00:11:34,083 --> 00:11:35,750
[YAGEN]
Could I have a taste as well?

215
00:11:35,833 --> 00:11:36,958
[UGUISUMARU]
Then me, please.

216
00:11:37,041 --> 00:11:38,541
[SHOKUDAIKIRI]
There's plenty to go around.

217
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:48,583
Not bad.

218
00:11:52,875 --> 00:11:53,916
Delicious.

219
00:11:56,833 --> 00:11:58,458
Kara.

220
00:11:58,541 --> 00:12:00,333
Let's talk about old times.

221
00:12:05,083 --> 00:12:07,500
So, here's a Masamune story.

222
00:12:07,583 --> 00:12:09,083
This one's my favorite.

223
00:12:18,208 --> 00:12:19,458
[BOTH gasp]

224
00:12:19,541 --> 00:12:22,083
[HASEBE]
This... this is it!

225
00:12:22,166 --> 00:12:23,750
[BOTH yell]

226
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:29,583
[SHISHIOU]
Master! He's here!

227
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:32,000
[laughing, chattering]

228
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
C'mon, boys, more saké!

229
00:12:39,875 --> 00:12:42,875
[GROUP]
He's gonna be so mad.

230
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:45,833
Wait. There's a good
explanation for this.

231
00:12:45,916 --> 00:12:47,125
[HASEBE]
He's here.

232
00:12:47,208 --> 00:12:48,458
[ALL]
Huh?

233
00:12:48,541 --> 00:12:49,666
[SHOKUDAIKIRI]
Uh... Who?

234
00:12:51,083 --> 00:12:52,291
[SHOKUDAIKIRI]
Guess he wandered off.

235
00:12:52,375 --> 00:12:53,791
[HASEBE]
Great.

236
00:12:53,875 --> 00:12:55,791
Well, hopefully someone showed
him to the master's room.

237
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:14,416
[UGUISUMARU] The weather
cleared up just for you.

238
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:15,458
[MIKAZUKI]
Did it, now?

239
00:13:15,541 --> 00:13:16,750
How lovely.

240
00:13:19,375 --> 00:13:20,416
Any luck?

241
00:13:21,958 --> 00:13:23,458
Although it might
help if he'd tell us

242
00:13:23,541 --> 00:13:25,000
who we were looking for.

243
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,333
Wait a second,
who are you talking to?

244
00:13:28,416 --> 00:13:29,583
[UGUISUMARU]
Oh.

245
00:13:29,666 --> 00:13:31,875
That would be my new
tea-drinking associate.

246
00:13:34,041 --> 00:13:35,000
[MIKAZUKI laughs]

247
00:13:35,083 --> 00:13:36,875
An introduction is in order.

248
00:13:38,333 --> 00:13:42,125
I am the sword called
Mikazuki Munechika.

249
00:13:42,208 --> 00:13:44,583
It's a pleasure to meet you.

250
00:13:44,666 --> 00:13:45,750
Mikazuki?

251
00:13:47,125 --> 00:13:49,083
His creation marked the
beginning of sword-making

252
00:13:49,166 --> 00:13:50,583
as we know it today.

253
00:13:50,666 --> 00:13:52,166
He's hailed as the
most beautiful of the

254
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:53,958
Five Great Swords of Japan.

255
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:55,875
An unparalleled masterpiece.

256
00:13:57,916 --> 00:13:59,833
[YASUSADA]
He doesn't act like it, though.

257
00:14:00,833 --> 00:14:02,750
He seems kinda like an old man.

258
00:14:02,833 --> 00:14:04,458
[MIKAZUKI laughs]

259
00:14:04,541 --> 00:14:07,125
I was forged during
the eleventh century.

260
00:14:07,208 --> 00:14:09,166
That would make me quite old.

261
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:12,000
[TSURUMARU] Hey, we finally
got a Sanjou sword, huh?

262
00:14:12,083 --> 00:14:13,291
I'm a Goujou.

263
00:14:13,375 --> 00:14:15,083
The name's Tsurumaru.

264
00:14:15,166 --> 00:14:16,125
Well!

265
00:14:16,208 --> 00:14:17,958
A sincere honor.

266
00:14:18,041 --> 00:14:19,500
[TSURUMARU] This place
is called the citadel,

267
00:14:19,583 --> 00:14:20,833
if you haven't heard.

268
00:14:20,916 --> 00:14:23,375
It's pretty big, so let me
show you around later.

269
00:14:24,666 --> 00:14:28,000
I should have said so,
but I am Uguisumaru.

270
00:14:28,083 --> 00:14:31,000
Did you happen to see
Ookanehira before we met?

271
00:14:31,083 --> 00:14:33,916
No, only Hasebe and
Shishiou, I'm afraid.

272
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,041
Ah, if you don't mind me asking,

273
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:38,375
what are the strange black
clothes you're all wearing?

274
00:14:39,583 --> 00:14:42,083
Maybe you heard, but the
master's been looking forward

275
00:14:42,166 --> 00:14:44,750
to his arrival more than
any other sword out there.

276
00:14:44,833 --> 00:14:45,958
I'm glad he made it.

277
00:14:46,041 --> 00:14:48,416
Yeah? Not as glad as
the master, I'm sure.

278
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:50,083
You say that like
it's a bad thing.

279
00:14:50,166 --> 00:14:51,208
Come on.

280
00:14:51,291 --> 00:14:53,541
Could you be any more naïve?

281
00:14:53,625 --> 00:14:55,500
The master loved us before,

282
00:14:55,583 --> 00:14:58,250
but that's no guarantee
now that he's here.

283
00:14:58,333 --> 00:14:59,291
Huh?

284
00:15:01,083 --> 00:15:02,500
I guess we'll find out.

285
00:15:03,583 --> 00:15:05,833
All right, I hope you
guys are ready to rock!

286
00:15:05,916 --> 00:15:07,125
[laughs]

287
00:15:07,208 --> 00:15:08,166
Bam!

288
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:09,666
'Cause we got
ourselves a mission!

289
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:10,833
That's sudden.

290
00:15:10,916 --> 00:15:13,041
My laundry nightmare
is coming true.

291
00:15:13,125 --> 00:15:14,375
[SHISHIOU]
I'll read the dispatch.

292
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:16,833
The captain is...

293
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:19,125
Tachi Mikazuki Munechika.

294
00:15:20,375 --> 00:15:23,541
[KASHUU] He just got here
and he's captain already?

295
00:15:23,625 --> 00:15:26,583
[SHISHIOU] Next up, Uchigatana
Kashuu Kiyomitsu.

296
00:15:26,666 --> 00:15:28,208
Oh. Uh, right.

297
00:15:28,791 --> 00:15:30,708
[SHISHIOU]
Tantou... Gokotai!

298
00:15:30,791 --> 00:15:32,083
That's all.

299
00:15:32,166 --> 00:15:33,958
--[SHOKUDAIKIRI] Only three?
--[YAGEN] That's odd.

300
00:15:36,583 --> 00:15:38,875
Hi, Shishiou,
do you need something?

301
00:15:38,958 --> 00:15:40,791
[SHISHIOU]
You've been called on a mission.

302
00:15:40,875 --> 00:15:42,208
O-Okay.

303
00:15:42,291 --> 00:15:43,791
And...

304
00:15:43,875 --> 00:15:46,666
Looks like you guys're headed to
Utsunomiya Castle for this one.

305
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:48,291
1868.

306
00:15:48,375 --> 00:15:50,000
[ALL] Huh?
[YAGEN] Again?

307
00:15:50,083 --> 00:15:52,083
This isn't the first time
we've been sent there.

308
00:15:52,166 --> 00:15:54,500
The enemy must have
something in mind, huh?

309
00:15:54,583 --> 00:15:56,041
They keep intruding
on the battle

310
00:15:56,125 --> 00:15:58,458
between the shogunate's army
and the new government's army,

311
00:15:58,541 --> 00:16:00,500
but I don't know why
that's so important.

312
00:16:00,583 --> 00:16:02,916
The soldiers they send
aren't very strong, either.

313
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,583
We've beaten them
dozens of times.

314
00:16:04,666 --> 00:16:05,833
I don't get it.

315
00:16:05,916 --> 00:16:07,750
[SHOKUDAIKIRI]
Still, why a three-sword team?

316
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:10,208
I stopped trying to figure
out the master's plans.

317
00:16:10,291 --> 00:16:11,416
I just go with it.

318
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:12,583
Enough small talk!

319
00:16:12,666 --> 00:16:14,041
Go get ready for battle!

320
00:16:14,125 --> 00:16:16,166
Only thirty minutes
till you take off.

321
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:17,250
Good luck!

322
00:16:17,333 --> 00:16:19,333
Utsunomiya Castle again?

323
00:16:19,416 --> 00:16:20,458
You got this.

324
00:16:27,791 --> 00:16:31,041
[KASHUU] The master is
already favoring Mikazuki.

325
00:16:31,125 --> 00:16:32,583
They probably want to
train him to be captain

326
00:16:32,666 --> 00:16:35,000
on as many missions as possible.

327
00:16:35,083 --> 00:16:36,333
I knew this would happen.

328
00:16:38,541 --> 00:16:40,291
I'm just there for support.

329
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:42,041
To help him grow stronger.

330
00:16:44,625 --> 00:16:46,458
Speaking of which,
that's probably the plan

331
00:16:46,541 --> 00:16:48,041
with Gokotai, too.

332
00:16:48,125 --> 00:16:51,083
He hasn't been on many missions
lately and he lacks confidence.

333
00:16:53,083 --> 00:16:54,416
Let's hurry up and
get this over with.

334
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:55,708
[MIKAZUKI]
Pardon the delay.

335
00:17:02,958 --> 00:17:04,583
I love your battle clothes!

336
00:17:04,666 --> 00:17:06,791
You look super cool!

337
00:17:06,875 --> 00:17:09,083
From the master. Carry it.

338
00:17:09,166 --> 00:17:10,333
A gift of some sort?

339
00:17:10,416 --> 00:17:11,625
It's a protection charm.

340
00:17:11,708 --> 00:17:14,250
If something bad happens,
it'll keep you safe.

341
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:15,166
[MIKAZUKI]
I see.

342
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:16,875
Then I shall treasure it.

343
00:17:19,083 --> 00:17:20,208
It's your first battle,

344
00:17:20,291 --> 00:17:22,375
so there's still a great
deal you don't know.

345
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:24,541
If you have any questions,
ask Kashuu.

346
00:17:24,625 --> 00:17:26,000
Thank you, I will.

347
00:17:26,083 --> 00:17:28,166
I'm grateful to
have you, Kashuu.

348
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:29,291
Yeah, yeah.

349
00:17:29,375 --> 00:17:31,458
First, you have to
operate that device.

350
00:17:31,541 --> 00:17:32,291
Oh.

351
00:17:32,375 --> 00:17:34,333
Don't worry. Just watch me.

352
00:17:37,458 --> 00:17:41,333
The date, time,
and then the place.

353
00:17:41,416 --> 00:17:43,458
Right, let's do this.

354
00:17:43,541 --> 00:17:45,083
Come back safe.

355
00:17:45,166 --> 00:17:46,250
[HASEBE]
Stay vigilant.

356
00:18:02,875 --> 00:18:06,250
Huh... So this is
Utsunomiya, is it?

357
00:18:06,333 --> 00:18:08,125
My, what a splendid castle.

358
00:18:08,208 --> 00:18:10,000
We start off by
scouting the area

359
00:18:10,083 --> 00:18:11,750
to form a strategy of attack.

360
00:18:11,833 --> 00:18:13,166
Very well, then.

361
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:14,250
Let's see.

362
00:18:18,166 --> 00:18:19,125
[MIKAZUKI]
Hmm...

363
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:23,166
Captain...

364
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:25,041
There's a gate right behind us.

365
00:18:25,125 --> 00:18:26,541
Why don't we start with that?

366
00:18:26,625 --> 00:18:27,583
[GOKOTAI gasps]

367
00:18:28,416 --> 00:18:30,541
[GOKOTAI]
Th-The enemy is here!

368
00:18:30,625 --> 00:18:32,083
[MIKAZUKI]
Are they, now?

369
00:18:32,166 --> 00:18:32,916
Hello, there!

370
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,041
[SOLDIER 5A growls]

371
00:18:34,125 --> 00:18:35,166
[MIKAZUKI]
Kashuu?

372
00:18:37,375 --> 00:18:38,208
[SOLDIER 5A grunts]

373
00:18:38,291 --> 00:18:40,541
Oh, my. Excellent swordplay.

374
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,583
[KASHUU] I've been working
on that one with Yasusada.

375
00:18:44,666 --> 00:18:46,291
These guys don't stand a chance.

376
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:47,333
[GOKOTAI yells]

377
00:18:50,166 --> 00:18:51,125
[SOLDIER 5B growls]

378
00:18:52,291 --> 00:18:53,125
Gokotai!

379
00:18:53,208 --> 00:18:54,750
Damn it!
He's not gonna hold out.

380
00:18:58,958 --> 00:18:59,666
[SOLDIER 5C growls]

381
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:00,791
[GOKOTAI yells]

382
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:03,666
Mikazuki!

383
00:19:11,708 --> 00:19:14,791
[MIKAZUKI laughing]

384
00:19:18,666 --> 00:19:21,291
I'm sorry, I suppose
I shouldn't be laughing.

385
00:19:32,875 --> 00:19:35,000
[MIKAZUKI]
There's a fire inside me.

386
00:19:35,083 --> 00:19:36,750
Time to let it burn.

387
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:39,708
[MIKAZUKI]
Ha!

388
00:19:52,166 --> 00:19:55,916
[KASHUU] What the hell
does he need me for?

389
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,041
Mikazuki's in a class
of his own.

390
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:00,708
[KASHUU grunts]

391
00:20:07,458 --> 00:20:09,666
[KASHUU] I wonder if the master
was trying to teach me a lesson

392
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:10,833
in humility.

393
00:20:10,916 --> 00:20:12,083
[YASUSADA]
Huh?

394
00:20:12,166 --> 00:20:15,083
[KASHUU] I've gotten too
arrogant, and sloppy.

395
00:20:15,166 --> 00:20:18,291
This was a simple mission
and I let the enemy ambush us.

396
00:20:18,375 --> 00:20:20,208
[YASUSADA]
It happens.

397
00:20:20,291 --> 00:20:22,541
I put Gokotai's life in danger.

398
00:20:22,625 --> 00:20:26,000
Mikazuki suffered those
injuries because of me, as well.

399
00:20:27,125 --> 00:20:29,208
I was shown how
weak I really am.

400
00:20:29,291 --> 00:20:31,833
It was a test and
I failed it miserably.

401
00:20:33,083 --> 00:20:34,166
[sighs]

402
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:36,333
The master must hate me now.

403
00:20:36,416 --> 00:20:37,333
Come on.

404
00:20:37,416 --> 00:20:39,458
[MIKAZUKI]
You're greatly mistaken.

405
00:20:39,541 --> 00:20:42,416
[YASUSADA] Oh, wow, finished
with your repairs already?

406
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:43,416
Indeed.

407
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,333
They took excellent care of me.

408
00:20:47,041 --> 00:20:49,208
[MIKAZUKI]
May I have a seat here?

409
00:20:49,291 --> 00:20:50,250
[KASHUU]
Sure.

410
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,291
[MIKAZUKI] I just returned
from the master's room,

411
00:20:54,375 --> 00:20:56,166
where I delivered
the battle report.

412
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:58,916
Aditionally, I was told why
you and I were chosen

413
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,666
to carry out this
mission together.

414
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:03,458
It's quite simple.

415
00:21:03,541 --> 00:21:06,750
The master wanted me to see
our strongest warrior in action.

416
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:10,666
The master was ceaseless
in their praise of your methods

417
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:14,458
and stressed that there is no
finer model for me to emulate.

418
00:21:14,541 --> 00:21:17,166
You're quite popular, it seems.

419
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:18,916
How can you say that
when I wasn't able

420
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,250
to protect you or Gokotai?

421
00:21:21,333 --> 00:21:23,708
We all played our parts
well in that battle.

422
00:21:23,791 --> 00:21:26,541
Your efforts allowed me
to protect him instead.

423
00:21:26,625 --> 00:21:29,583
And to show you what
I'm capable of, of course.

424
00:21:29,666 --> 00:21:32,666
I may be an old man,
but I can be rather useful.

425
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:35,250
I wish you had been
there, too, Yamatonokami.

426
00:21:35,333 --> 00:21:37,916
Though I'm sure we'll
practice together soon.

427
00:21:39,416 --> 00:21:41,166
[MIKAZUKI] And I hope that
you'll share your wisdom

428
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:43,083
with us both, Kashuu.

429
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:47,000
How do you do it?

430
00:21:48,541 --> 00:21:50,375
How are you so kind to me?

431
00:21:50,458 --> 00:21:52,125
Where does that come from?

432
00:21:52,208 --> 00:21:53,708
[MIKAZUKI laughs]

433
00:21:53,791 --> 00:21:56,458
I never thought
of myself as kind, but...

434
00:21:56,541 --> 00:21:59,750
"Kindness" is understanding
another person,

435
00:21:59,833 --> 00:22:02,583
much like seeing
through an opponent.

436
00:22:02,666 --> 00:22:05,541
Perhaps I've tempered this
understanding through time.

437
00:22:05,625 --> 00:22:07,208
I should be flattered.

438
00:22:08,916 --> 00:22:10,833
Kindness is strength, after all.

439
00:22:20,708 --> 00:22:22,125
[KASHUU laughs]

440
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:24,666
You sound like an old man
when you say stuff like that.

441
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:26,083
[MIKAZUKI]
Because I am!

442
00:22:26,166 --> 00:22:27,625
[laughs]

443
00:22:27,708 --> 00:22:30,416
Splendid. Life is splendid.
