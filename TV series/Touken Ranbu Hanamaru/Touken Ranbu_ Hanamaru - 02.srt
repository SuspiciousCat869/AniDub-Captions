and the Hanamaru days they
spent in a certain citadel.

Good morning.

The snow has piled up
considerably overnight,

see that for yourself.

Wow, is that you, Mitsubou?

The master has placed
their faith in you,

so I expect excellence.

34

As for everyone else, you
remember what it was like

35

when you first came here,
so show them the ropes.

Moving on now,

37
00:03:51,916 --> 00:03:53,583
I will announce
today's assignments

Cooking duty:

Naturally, I will attend to
the master, as I always do.

47
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,333
So do the rest of us
get to go on a mission,

or what?

Well, if you need me,

I'll be polishing my guns
and shooting holes in stuff!

Why? Get someone else.

our fine, open air baths.

warm baths for all of us?

wring the filth from its folds.

Don't even bother.

I'm just a copy...
a duplicate sword.

I don't see what that has
to do with clean clothes.

100

Your heart is clouded, just
like your clothes are soiled.

[KASHUU]
That's fabric softener.

A modern convenience
our master is fond of.

110
00:06:35,625 --> 00:06:37,208
It makes things soft?

told me they have cabbage

Feels like you could
dig right in, doesn't it?

116
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:57,375
[NAKIGITSUNE]
If it's growing in this weather,

117
00:06:57,458 --> 00:06:58,958
it must be snow cabbage.

118
00:06:59,041 --> 00:07:00,875
I heard it's so good
you can eat it raw!

Hold on!

This food is for
everybody here, right?

124
00:07:08,875 --> 00:07:10,208
We can't take it!

125

[NAKIGITSUNE] Nakigitsune says
it's okay, so it's okay.

126
00:07:12,916 --> 00:07:15,666
I'll keep your secret,
but you've gotta share.

[NAKIGITSUNE, AIZEN]
Let's dig in!

128
00:07:17,791 --> 00:07:18,833
[KASHUU]
And here...

129
00:07:18,916 --> 00:07:20,541
...is where we grow our food.

130
00:07:20,625 --> 00:07:21,583
Wow, that's great,

131
00:07:21,666 --> 00:07:23,500
the whole citadel's
self-sufficient.

132
00:07:27,416 --> 00:07:29,291
Something sure smells nice!

133
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,458
[YASUSADA]
What is it? Must be close.

134
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:40,958
There! You can't hide from me!

[AIZEN, NAKIGITSUNE gasp]

136
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:44,500
[YASUSADA]
Are they vegetables?

137
00:07:44,583 --> 00:07:46,083
That plant is called an herb,

138
00:07:46,166 --> 00:07:47,625
and the master's
been really excited

139
00:07:47,708 --> 00:07:49,166
about growing it
in the citadel.

140
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:51,541
But I'm sure the novelty
will wear off eventually.

141
00:07:51,625 --> 00:07:52,958
So are these extra fancy,

142
00:07:53,041 --> 00:07:55,791
or are they just like the
stuff we put in porridge?

143
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:57,166
Might as well find out.

144
00:08:01,041 --> 00:08:02,375
Mmm!

145
00:08:02,458 --> 00:08:04,708
One little taste, and my
sinuses are cleared right up!

146
00:08:04,791 --> 00:08:08,208
[DOUDANUKI] Bet I could use
this as a weapon, if I had to.

147
00:08:08,291 --> 00:08:09,583
Why don't we move on?

You sure are cute, Mr. Horse.

And these are the stables.

[TSURUMARU]
It's Ishikirimaru!

Hello, Tsurumaru.
Nice to meet you in person.

153

I never would've thought
that you of all people

154
00:08:22,666 --> 00:08:24,083
would be tending horses.

155
00:08:24,166 --> 00:08:25,500
People sure can change.

[laughing]

157
00:08:26,958 --> 00:08:29,208
I'm only doing this because
no one needs healing.

158
00:08:29,291 --> 00:08:30,541
That sounds more like you.

159
00:08:30,625 --> 00:08:33,541
Nice to have something
familiar to latch onto.

160

[YASUSADA] Hey, check out
Tsurumaru and the horse.

00:08:36,083 --> 00:08:37,833
Look, their eyes are sparkling!

162
00:08:39,625 --> 00:08:40,708
[KASHUU chuckling]

163
00:08:40,791 --> 00:08:42,208
[AKITA]
Kashuu.

164
00:08:42,291 --> 00:08:45,250
Do you know the horse's name?
No one ever told me.

165
00:08:45,333 --> 00:08:46,916
Oh it's... Hanataro.

166
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,208
Hanataro?

167
00:08:48,291 --> 00:08:50,083
[TSURUMARU] Sounds kind
of floofy if you ask me.

168
00:08:50,166 --> 00:08:51,375
[KASHUU] You're gonna
have to take that one up

169
00:08:51,458 --> 00:08:52,416
with the master.

170
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:53,916
I'm not the one who named it.

171
00:08:57,166 --> 00:08:58,416
[AKITA]
Hanataro.

172
00:09:00,208 --> 00:09:01,583
[GOKOTAI, MAEDA grunting]

173
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:03,166
[KASHUU] And this would
be the training hall.

174
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:05,500
[DOUDANUKI] Hitting things!
Now that's more like it!

175
00:09:05,583 --> 00:09:07,458
Maybe I won't be
so bored after all!

176
00:09:07,541 --> 00:09:09,208
[GOKOTAI, MAEDA grunting]

177
00:09:10,791 --> 00:09:12,750
[DOUDANUKI] Training's not
as fun as kicking ass,

178
00:09:12,833 --> 00:09:15,416
but the more you train,
the more ass you can kick.

179
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:16,625
You guys look pretty small.

180
00:09:16,708 --> 00:09:18,500
Have you ever been
in a real fight before?

181
00:09:18,583 --> 00:09:19,583
Yes, sir.

182
00:09:20,833 --> 00:09:22,875
[DOUDANUKI]
All right, then... come at me!

183
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:25,250
[yelling]

184
00:09:25,333 --> 00:09:27,583
[KASHUU] Could you wait until
the tour is over with, please?

185
00:09:36,583 --> 00:09:38,708
Well, that's everything.

186
00:09:38,791 --> 00:09:40,708
You didn't tell me
there were girls here!

187
00:09:40,791 --> 00:09:42,083
And they live with us?

188
00:09:42,166 --> 00:09:43,500
The new recruit!

189
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:47,125
Oh and, your name was
Doudanuki Masakuni, I believe?

190
00:09:47,208 --> 00:09:50,458
Anyway, I'm Midare Toushirou.
It's nice to meet you!

191
00:09:50,541 --> 00:09:52,708
Oh. You're a... dude.

192
00:09:55,291 --> 00:09:57,500
[HACHISUKA]
Kashuu, I have a question.

193
00:09:57,583 --> 00:09:58,916
What is it?

194
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,833
There are too many boxes here.
Can I throw them away?

195
00:10:01,916 --> 00:10:02,958
Why? Who cares?

196
00:10:03,041 --> 00:10:04,791
They are taking up
the whole room.

197
00:10:04,875 --> 00:10:06,916
The master wants to
keep them for some reason.

198
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,916
Said they might be
important someday.

199
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,083
I won't criticize
their hoarding tendencies,

200
00:10:11,166 --> 00:10:12,875
but at least let me store
them in the warehouse

201
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:14,291
for the time being.

202
00:10:14,375 --> 00:10:16,958
Doudanuki. Perhaps you
could help me carry them?

203
00:10:17,041 --> 00:10:18,416
Uh, yeah, sure.

204
00:10:21,041 --> 00:10:22,583
[DOUDANUKI]
That's gonna mess me up.

205
00:10:22,666 --> 00:10:25,583
I can't believe...
that's not a girl.

206
00:10:26,708 --> 00:10:27,875
[TSURUMARU]
Hey, Kashuu,

207
00:10:27,958 --> 00:10:30,041
what kind of person is
this "master" of ours?

208
00:10:30,125 --> 00:10:32,250
[YASUSADA] Actually, I've been
wondering the same thing,

209
00:10:32,333 --> 00:10:34,166
but since I haven't been
invited to meet them,

210
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:35,708
I was afraid to ask.

211
00:10:35,791 --> 00:10:38,458
Mmm... Let me think.

212
00:10:38,541 --> 00:10:40,333
They're sloppy and
they're clumsy.

213
00:10:40,416 --> 00:10:43,125
You can't rely on them
for anything at all,

214
00:10:43,208 --> 00:10:45,458
and I have no idea what's
going on in their head.

215
00:10:47,291 --> 00:10:49,000
Then again...

216
00:10:49,083 --> 00:10:51,125
It's cute how they
always give it their best.

217
00:10:51,208 --> 00:10:52,541
That's worth something.

218
00:10:54,666 --> 00:10:56,583
Why don't we go
and pay them a visit?

219
00:10:56,666 --> 00:10:58,958
[TSURUMARU chuckles]
That's a good idea!

220
00:10:59,041 --> 00:11:01,000
It's not like we're doing
anything right now,

221
00:11:01,083 --> 00:11:02,625
and their room is
around the corner!

222
00:11:02,708 --> 00:11:03,750
We might as well...

223
00:11:03,833 --> 00:11:05,833
No, that's a terrible idea!
Tsurumaru!

224
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:17,666
You think it'd be funny if
I jumped in and screamed?

225
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:18,916
Hold on a second!

226
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,708
What's up?

227
00:11:20,791 --> 00:11:23,250
[HASEBE] Master, the state of
your desk is simply deplorable!

228
00:11:23,333 --> 00:11:26,416
I carefully arranged
these books for you.

229
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:29,625
[KASHUU] Hasebe is doing his...
uh... thing in there.

230
00:11:29,708 --> 00:11:32,291
[TSURUMARU] I see.
He sure is a hard worker, huh?

231
00:11:33,625 --> 00:11:35,416
[HASEBE]
Oh, Master, why?!

232
00:11:41,833 --> 00:11:43,083
[YASUSADA]
That was delicious!

233
00:11:43,166 --> 00:11:45,583
Wow, Mitsubou, that
was an excellent meal!

234
00:11:45,666 --> 00:11:46,833
I try my best.

235
00:11:46,916 --> 00:11:48,666
I've always longed
for something more.

236
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,791
I can't just fight all the time.

237
00:11:50,875 --> 00:11:52,958
[dishes rattling]

238
00:11:53,041 --> 00:11:54,166
[TSURUMARU]
The wars that we fought in

239
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:55,583
have long since passed,

240
00:11:55,666 --> 00:11:57,541
so it seems strange to
be summoned to battle

241
00:11:57,625 --> 00:11:59,625
after so many years of peace.

242
00:11:59,708 --> 00:12:02,000
That's not the only
thing we have in common.

243
00:12:02,083 --> 00:12:03,583
Now that you mention it,

244
00:12:03,666 --> 00:12:06,166
a lot of us came from the same
period and had the same master.

245
00:12:07,291 --> 00:12:08,875
[TSURUMARU]
Oda...

246
00:12:08,958 --> 00:12:10,083
[GROUP]
...Nobunaga.

247
00:12:10,708 --> 00:12:11,833
So serious!

248
00:12:11,916 --> 00:12:13,583
You got some bad memories?

249
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:17,333
It's complicated, that's all.

250
00:12:17,416 --> 00:12:20,000
Go ahead. If you've got
something to say, then say it.

251
00:12:20,083 --> 00:12:22,666
Actually, I would quite
prefer if you went first.

252
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:24,375
[clears throat]

253
00:12:24,458 --> 00:12:26,000
Well, if I'm being
perfectly frank,

254
00:12:26,083 --> 00:12:29,000
just thinking about the
man makes me sick.

255
00:12:29,083 --> 00:12:31,500
One day, when he became
angry with a tea servant,

256
00:12:31,583 --> 00:12:33,875
he decided to slay him
with his own hands.

257
00:12:33,958 --> 00:12:35,250
Or with me, rather.

258
00:12:35,333 --> 00:12:36,958
When the young boy
hid in a cabinet,

259
00:12:37,041 --> 00:12:39,041
he cut straight through
the whole thing.

260
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:41,250
[SOUZA] Well, at least he
displayed your capabilities.

261
00:12:41,333 --> 00:12:43,791
It's what he did next
that I'm so angry about!

262
00:12:43,875 --> 00:12:46,500
He granted me a name for my
cabinet-smashing prowess,

263
00:12:46,583 --> 00:12:48,833
then simply passed me off to
somebody who wasn't even

264
00:12:48,916 --> 00:12:49,791
a vassal!

265
00:12:49,875 --> 00:12:50,958
How dare he?

266
00:12:51,041 --> 00:12:51,958
[TSURUMARU laughs]

267
00:12:52,041 --> 00:12:53,375
[HASEBE]
It's no laughing matter!

268
00:12:53,458 --> 00:12:56,666
Souza, you had the same master.
Did you hate him too?

269
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:58,833
I mean... that's
more or less true.

270
00:12:58,916 --> 00:13:00,083
[YASUSADA]
What happened?

271
00:13:00,166 --> 00:13:01,416
Tell him.

272
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:05,333
I don't have any good memories,
that much is true.

273
00:13:05,416 --> 00:13:08,041
My master was
obsessed with power.

274
00:13:08,125 --> 00:13:10,000
He believed that this
world and everything in it

275
00:13:10,083 --> 00:13:12,041
was destined to be his.

276
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:15,416
I was handed over to him after
the battle of Okehazama.

277
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:18,458
He kept me at his side
and polished me often.

278
00:13:18,541 --> 00:13:20,708
He must have been
quite pleased with me,

279
00:13:20,791 --> 00:13:23,416
in his possessive sort of way.

280
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:26,541
That is to say... he saw
fit to engrave his own name

281
00:13:26,625 --> 00:13:28,416
onto the base of my blade.

282
00:13:30,041 --> 00:13:33,000
Now, it's as if it's
engraved upon my very soul.

283
00:13:33,083 --> 00:13:36,666
In the end, I was just another
treasure for him to brag about.

284
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:39,583
I was forged for battle,
but scarcely saw it.

285
00:13:39,666 --> 00:13:42,625
I feel as if I was robbed
of my purpose.

286
00:13:42,708 --> 00:13:44,500
You don't have to
look at it that way.

287
00:13:44,583 --> 00:13:46,125
It seems like you were loved.

288
00:13:47,041 --> 00:13:48,333
Is that wrong?

289
00:13:48,416 --> 00:13:51,208
Not everyone likes to
be loved in the same way.

290
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:54,875
So, what about you, Yagen?

291
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:56,958
You probably hold
a grudge too, right?

292
00:13:57,041 --> 00:13:59,791
I mean, you were nestled right
next to his heart all the time.

293
00:13:59,875 --> 00:14:02,666
I suppose, though I never
thought of it like that.

294
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:03,833
I don't know.

295
00:14:03,916 --> 00:14:05,291
What do ya mean?

296
00:14:05,375 --> 00:14:06,708
He was straightforward.

297
00:14:06,791 --> 00:14:08,541
That was comforting in a way.

298
00:14:08,625 --> 00:14:10,375
--[door opens]
--[KASEN] Hasebe.

299
00:14:10,458 --> 00:14:11,958
The master is calling for you.

300
00:14:12,041 --> 00:14:13,458
It sounds important.

301
00:14:13,541 --> 00:14:16,166
I see. I'll be there
promptly, then.

302

[HASEBE]
Honnouji?

303
00:14:18,666 --> 00:14:20,833
The battle where
Nobunaga was killed?

304
00:14:20,916 --> 00:14:23,958
Ah, forgive me, it's just
a coincidence, that's all.

305
00:14:24,041 --> 00:14:25,166
What is the lineup?

306
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:29,666
Ah. I see. Very well.

307
00:14:34,458 --> 00:14:36,208
Prepare for a mission,
or in this case,

308
00:14:36,291 --> 00:14:37,791
a reunion with Nobunaga!

309
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:41,583
And this time...
I'm the captain.

310
00:14:43,416 --> 00:14:45,625
It looks like the
team is assembled.

311
00:14:45,708 --> 00:14:47,000
I will be your captain.

312
00:14:47,083 --> 00:14:48,625
You said that already.

313
00:14:48,708 --> 00:14:51,041
[HASEBE] Our dispatch
location will be Honnouji.

314
00:14:51,125 --> 00:14:53,333
The year is 1582.

315
00:14:53,416 --> 00:14:54,500
Perfect timing.

I'm not quite sure
how that makes me feel.

00:14:56,833 --> 00:14:58,666
It's certainly
nostalgic, at least.

318
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:01,000
So what exactly does
the History Retrograde Army

319
00:15:01,083 --> 00:15:03,375
hope to accomplish
by going there?

320
00:15:03,458 --> 00:15:05,250
[HASEBE] The master assumes
that they will target

321
00:15:05,333 --> 00:15:07,208
Akechi Mitsuhide's forces.

322
00:15:07,291 --> 00:15:09,625
Heading him off before he can
launch his surprise attack

323
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:10,875
on Nobunaga.

324
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:12,708
Do they think Nobunaga
could rule the nation

325
00:15:12,791 --> 00:15:14,416
if he didn't die that night?

326
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,583
[HASEBE] The details are
irrelevant to our mission.

327
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:20,250
All we need to worry about is
destroying the enemy, you mean.

328
00:15:20,333 --> 00:15:22,958
We cannot allow
Oda Nobunaga to live.

329
00:15:23,041 --> 00:15:25,333
This will be his ending.

330
00:15:25,416 --> 00:15:27,291
It sounds like you
wanna kill him yourself!

331
00:15:27,375 --> 00:15:29,208
History decided that, not us.

332
00:15:29,291 --> 00:15:31,625
Our feelings just happen
to align this time.

333
00:15:31,708 --> 00:15:33,416
[HASEBE]
I will not tolerate defeat.

334
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:34,833
Is that understood?

335
00:15:34,916 --> 00:15:36,583
They really hate
their old master.

336
00:15:36,666 --> 00:15:38,208
I can hardly imagine that.

337
00:15:38,291 --> 00:15:41,291
Their feelings for him aren't
as simple as you might think.

338
00:15:41,375 --> 00:15:43,375
At any rate,
they're ready to fight.

339
00:15:43,458 --> 00:15:46,333
So this time around, we should
definitely give it our best.

340
00:15:46,416 --> 00:15:47,583
That's not funny!

341
00:15:47,666 --> 00:15:49,625
[HASEBE] Oh, I forgot
to mention something.

342
00:15:49,708 --> 00:15:52,208
Master said that we
should take our time.

343
00:15:52,291 --> 00:15:54,583
Nobody here has a
problem with that, right?

344
00:15:54,666 --> 00:15:55,916
I don't understand.

345
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,416
You're still a rookie, huh?

346
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:59,958
Most of us have long since
given up trying to figure out

347
00:16:00,041 --> 00:16:01,208
what the master thinks.

348
00:16:01,291 --> 00:16:03,500
It's likely just
for nostalgia's sake.

349
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:06,416
This battle does hold
a lot of memories for us.

350
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,875
That's an unnecessary
consideration.

351
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:11,500
Let's defeat the enemy
and return home quickly.

352
00:16:11,583 --> 00:16:12,583
[HASEBE]
I agree.

353
00:16:14,666 --> 00:16:17,333
As our master's attendant and
as the first division commander,

354
00:16:17,416 --> 00:16:19,166
I will expect you
to follow my orders

355
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:22,291
without your usual
bellyaching and mockery!

356
00:16:22,375 --> 00:16:24,083
Now off... to battle!

357
00:16:29,166 --> 00:16:30,291
[KASHUU]
I see.

358
00:16:30,375 --> 00:16:32,375
So this is Honnouji,
where your master died.

359
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:34,916
It's upsetting to think
that Nobunaga's so close.

360
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,666
I much prefer him dead.

361
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:37,791
That's harsh.

362
00:16:37,875 --> 00:16:39,666
Ha. This could be
your last chance.

363
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:41,791
Are you sure you don't
want to go pay him a visit?

364
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:43,041
No, thank you.

365
00:16:43,125 --> 00:16:44,916
That would only
disturb me further.

366
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,458
I don't want nightmares.

367
00:16:46,541 --> 00:16:49,041
You were right.
Their feelings are complicated.

368
00:16:49,125 --> 00:16:50,625
I shouldn't think about it.

369
00:16:50,708 --> 00:16:52,125
More importantly, Captain,

370
00:16:52,208 --> 00:16:54,791
I don't suppose you know
where our enemies are hiding?

371
00:16:54,875 --> 00:16:56,458
I'll leave the scouting to you.

372
00:16:56,541 --> 00:16:59,041
The attack came while
Nobunaga was sleeping.

373
00:16:59,125 --> 00:17:00,708
They'll likely
infiltrate the area,

374
00:17:00,791 --> 00:17:03,041
then launch an ambush
when Mitsuhide's troops

375
00:17:03,125 --> 00:17:04,625
enter at night.

376
00:17:04,708 --> 00:17:06,041
Since the sun is setting,

377
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:09,375
they should be here any second
now... on the outskirts.

378
00:17:11,333 --> 00:17:13,833
And just like magic,
our little friends appear.

379
00:17:15,208 --> 00:17:16,541
You know what to do.

380
00:17:16,625 --> 00:17:18,750
Wipe them out and
don't look back!

381
00:17:21,041 --> 00:17:22,250
[YASUSADA yells]

382
00:17:28,166 --> 00:17:29,333
Like old times!

383
00:17:29,416 --> 00:17:31,291
This new job isn't half bad!

384
00:17:31,375 --> 00:17:33,166
Does get the
blood pumping, huh?

385
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:35,833
[SOLDIER 2B growling]

386
00:17:35,916 --> 00:17:37,833
Well, you're certainly
big enough, aren't you?

387
00:17:37,916 --> 00:17:39,500
[SOLDIER 2B growling]

388
00:17:40,875 --> 00:17:42,875
I hope you're
taking this seriously.

389
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,541
'Cause if you let your
guard down... you're dead.

390
00:17:50,958 --> 00:17:52,666
[chuckles]
I told you.

391
00:17:53,416 --> 00:17:54,416
[SOUZA grunts]

392
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,333
Souza, you're not hurt, are you?

393
00:17:56,416 --> 00:17:58,125
A little pain isn't
going to kill me.

394
00:17:58,208 --> 00:17:59,375
I'm used to it, after all.

395
00:17:59,458 --> 00:18:01,000
Don't you dare, Souza.
Pull back.

396
00:18:01,083 --> 00:18:03,291
Hey, we got one
hiding behind that tree.

397
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,291
There's no use trying
to conceal yourself.

398
00:18:07,375 --> 00:18:08,083
[SOLDIER 2A growls]

399
00:18:08,166 --> 00:18:09,625
You can't escape me!

400
00:18:09,708 --> 00:18:11,791
You think you're
pretty sneaky, huh?

401
00:18:11,875 --> 00:18:13,583
Sorry, but you've gotta
get up really early

402
00:18:13,666 --> 00:18:15,458
to pull one over on me!

403
00:18:15,541 --> 00:18:18,041
Not too bad for
my first mission!

404
00:18:18,125 --> 00:18:20,625
I was nothing but
a bird in cage,

405
00:18:20,708 --> 00:18:22,833
but now, my new master
has given me a body,

406
00:18:22,916 --> 00:18:24,875
freedom and a
purpose to fight for.

407
00:18:24,958 --> 00:18:28,666
Even though I still bear the
seal of the demon king upon me.

408
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:30,166
He shall perish.

409
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:34,541
His fury and madness buried
here... as history intended!

410
00:18:35,458 --> 00:18:36,666
[SOUZA yells]

411
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:42,500
[YAGEN]
Are you hurt?

412
00:18:42,583 --> 00:18:44,916
On the contrary,
I feel quite liberated.

413
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,333
Nice work, everyone.

414
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:47,958
We've completed the mission.

415
00:18:49,333 --> 00:18:50,333
[SOUZA]
Hasebe.

416
00:18:51,791 --> 00:18:54,250
Perhaps we should stick
around for the show after all.

417
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:55,916
[HASEBE]
Mitsuhide's ambush, you mean?

418
00:18:57,625 --> 00:19:00,833
Huh? You're gonna stay here just
to watch your old master die?

419
00:19:00,916 --> 00:19:02,458
We'll see it through to the end.

420
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:03,708
We've been given
this opportunity,

421
00:19:03,791 --> 00:19:05,791
so we'll take our
time as advised.

422
00:19:05,875 --> 00:19:08,750
What about your injuries, Souza?
Will you be all right?

423
00:19:08,833 --> 00:19:09,958
We can return, if you like.

424
00:19:10,041 --> 00:19:11,333
I wouldn't dream
of running home

425
00:19:11,416 --> 00:19:13,375
over a tiny scratch
like this one.

426
00:19:15,916 --> 00:19:18,416
[SOLDIERS yelling]

427
00:19:24,208 --> 00:19:26,166
I thought they all
just hated Nobunaga,

428
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:28,583
but now I don't
know how to feel.

429
00:19:28,666 --> 00:19:32,250
Words don't necessarily reflect
how someone truly feels inside.

430
00:19:32,333 --> 00:19:34,583
Contradictory, isn't it?

431
00:19:34,666 --> 00:19:36,041
I understand now.

432
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:38,666
I see, Master.

433
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:42,166
That's why you gave us the
instruction to take our time.

434
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:43,333
Oh, yeah.

435
00:19:43,416 --> 00:19:44,625
You might be right.

436
00:19:49,625 --> 00:19:52,125
[chattering]

437
00:19:52,208 --> 00:19:53,666
Nice work out there today.

438
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:56,083
And nice work patching me up.

439
00:19:56,166 --> 00:19:57,166
It's fine.

440
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:00,750
You seem well.

441
00:20:00,833 --> 00:20:02,750
No lasting injuries, I presume?

442
00:20:02,833 --> 00:20:04,500
You were fighting
pretty hard back there.

443
00:20:04,583 --> 00:20:07,416
Are you asking as my
captain, or as my friend?

444
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:09,083
Either way, I'm lovely.

445
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:11,125
Though I have to ask why
we're eating <i>nabe</i> outside

446
00:20:11,208 --> 00:20:12,750
when the weather's so cold.

447
00:20:12,833 --> 00:20:14,500
We're having a welcome
party for all the new

448
00:20:14,583 --> 00:20:17,458
sword warriors, apparently.

449
00:20:17,541 --> 00:20:19,875
Hasebe. Mind if we converse?

450
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,291
[HASEBE] Even though we
watched to the bitter end,

451
00:20:28,375 --> 00:20:31,416
we never saw how
Nobunaga died, did we?

452
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:33,291
He was always
such a proud man.

453
00:20:33,375 --> 00:20:35,083
He would have
preferred it that way.

454
00:20:39,458 --> 00:20:41,541
[YASUSADA] Hey, I heard
this story about Nobunaga.

455
00:20:41,625 --> 00:20:43,166
Maybe you can confirm it for me.

456
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:44,500
Go ahead.

457
00:20:44,583 --> 00:20:46,458
Even though history says
that he died at Honnouji,

458
00:20:46,541 --> 00:20:48,250
I heard that when they
sifted through the rubble,

459
00:20:48,333 --> 00:20:50,041
they never found his body.

460
00:20:50,125 --> 00:20:51,250
Maybe not.

461
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:53,666
Many people assumed
he committed suicide.

462
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:55,083
But since there
were no witnesses,

463
00:20:55,166 --> 00:20:57,583
they could never confirm
his actual cause of death.

464
00:21:00,333 --> 00:21:02,833
Well, maybe that's because
he never really died at all.

465
00:21:02,916 --> 00:21:05,208
He escaped from Honnouji
under the veil of chaos,

466
00:21:05,291 --> 00:21:07,750
turned to the power of darkness,
and obtained immortality,

467
00:21:07,833 --> 00:21:09,375
becoming a true demon king!

468
00:21:09,458 --> 00:21:12,250
Scouring the earth, he searches
for revenge, even today!

[laughing]

470
00:21:15,625 --> 00:21:17,875
I dunno.
That's quite the fairy tale.

471
00:21:17,958 --> 00:21:19,833
It does sound like something
he would do, though.

472
00:21:19,916 --> 00:21:21,750
I suppose you're right.

473
00:21:21,833 --> 00:21:25,208
[YASUSADA] But if it was true,
I'd be kind of jealous.

474
00:21:25,291 --> 00:21:26,458
And why is that?

475
00:21:34,458 --> 00:21:37,083
If Nobunaga was alive
and here with us right now,

476
00:21:37,166 --> 00:21:39,750
if you could speak
with him in person,

477
00:21:39,833 --> 00:21:41,625
what do you think
you would say to him?

478
00:21:45,458 --> 00:21:48,208
I don't need to see him and
I don't need to say a thing.

479
00:21:48,291 --> 00:21:52,541
Well... it's not as though he'd
listen to a word we said anyway.

480
00:21:52,625 --> 00:21:54,416
[HASEBE, SOUZA laughing]

481
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,333
[HASEBE] Enough of that;
let's have a drink.

482
00:21:56,416 --> 00:21:58,250
[SOUZA]
What, just one?

483
00:21:58,333 --> 00:22:00,916
[YASUSADA]
I still miss Souji.

484
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,375
It would be really nice
he were still alive.

485
00:22:04,666 --> 00:22:06,333
[YASUSADA] I wonder what
I would say to him.

486
00:22:09,916 --> 00:22:12,458
Thinking of our
old master, huh?

487
00:22:12,541 --> 00:22:13,875
How'd you guess?

488
00:22:13,958 --> 00:22:16,000
Because anyone can
read you like a book.

489
00:22:16,083 --> 00:22:18,166
One look at your face
and it's obvious.

490
00:22:20,833 --> 00:22:22,916
[YASUSADA gasps]
It's a shooting star!

491
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,750
No, really? Where is it?

492
00:22:24,833 --> 00:22:26,291
Huh? Don't tell me I missed it!

493
00:22:26,375 --> 00:22:27,875
[YASUSADA] Aw, jeez!
I forgot to make a wish!

494
00:22:27,958 --> 00:22:29,208
This is all your fault!
