[MIKAZUKI]
The year is 2205 AD.

The History Retrograde Army
seeks to control the world

3
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:21,500
by altering its past.

00:00:22,541 --> 00:00:24,416
Born from the heart of swords,

5
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:27,708
we travel through time to
intercept and eliminate them.

Splendid. Simply splendid.

[KASHUU, YASUSADA]
This is a tale of the legendary

and the Hanamaru days

[NAGASONE]
Ha!

11
00:02:20,875 --> 00:02:21,833
Yah!

12
00:02:24,541 --> 00:02:27,000
Don't just stand over
there gawking at me.

13
00:02:27,083 --> 00:02:29,083
If you want something,
then out with it.

14
00:02:30,083 --> 00:02:31,750
I had to come see.

15
00:02:31,833 --> 00:02:34,750
You're the sword of the
famous Kondou Isami, after all.

16
00:02:34,833 --> 00:02:38,166
It's like having the leader
of the Shinsengumi here.

17
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:41,333
Though to be frank, you
don't look like much to me.

18
00:02:44,625 --> 00:02:47,500
Then perhaps I'll look
better after some training.

19
00:02:47,583 --> 00:02:49,000
Don't worry.

20
00:02:49,083 --> 00:02:50,875
I have no intention of holding
the rest of the team back.

21
00:02:50,958 --> 00:02:53,583
Sakamoto Ryouma
and Kondou Isami.

22
00:02:54,708 --> 00:02:56,416
The man who brought
down the shogunate,

23
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,208
and the man who protected it.

24
00:02:58,291 --> 00:02:59,958
And now, the swords
of those bitter rivals

25
00:03:00,041 --> 00:03:01,833
have been reunited in the flesh.

26
00:03:01,916 --> 00:03:04,875
Bet nobody saw that one coming.

27
00:03:04,958 --> 00:03:07,541
If you wanna do some
real training, I can help.

28
00:03:07,625 --> 00:03:09,958
But you'll have to trade
in that old sword for a gun.

29
00:03:11,458 --> 00:03:13,500
There's only one
style suited to me!

30
00:03:13,583 --> 00:03:16,708
My swordplay is manly and
direct, like Kondo Isami's!

31
00:03:18,958 --> 00:03:22,416
This is the way I show my
gratitude and my loyalty to him!

32
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:24,708
Hold on there.

33
00:03:24,791 --> 00:03:27,833
You're making it sound like
Sakamoto Ryouma wasn't manly!

34
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:30,333
He was as cheerful and
openhearted as they come.

35
00:03:30,416 --> 00:03:31,541
Hm?

36
00:03:31,625 --> 00:03:33,000
So what?

37
00:03:33,083 --> 00:03:36,416
Kondou Isami was forthright,
the epitome of manliness.

38
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:38,625
Sakamoto was wise
and broad-minded!

39
00:03:38,708 --> 00:03:40,666
Kondou was kind and generous!

40
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:42,166
Sakamoto was courteous!

41
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:44,083
Kondou was resolute!

42
00:03:44,166 --> 00:03:45,375
He was gentle, but firm!

43
00:03:45,458 --> 00:03:46,833
He was daring, but prudent!

44
00:03:46,916 --> 00:03:47,750

00:03:47,833 --> 00:03:48,750
No, Kondou!

Do they not get along,
or is this normal for them?

I honestly can't tell at all.

49
00:03:56,333 --> 00:03:58,166
I think they like it this way.

So yeah, they're fine.

Oh?

I assumed since you
liked the summer,

you wouldn't care
much for winter.

Who cares about the weather?

Rain or shine, I'm happy because
Nagasone is here at the citadel!

he didn't go easy on me one bit!

C'mon!

He's merely a fake--

as a Koutetsu.

That doesn't really
matter to me either way.

you'd still be you, right?

same location again, Master?

Great.

I'm sure there's a perfectly
logical reason for this.

The grudge between your old
masters doesn't matter here.

We don't tolerate infighting.

The mission location
is a narrow space.

105

You'll have to coordinate
your attacks to succeed,

106
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,833
and that means cooperating.

107

I'll be fine, as long as
nobody else picks a fight.

Because I'm Master's

for all of us equally.

They speak very highly of
your accomplishments, Kashuu.

They respect every detail,
large and small,

and understand those
who fight for their cause.

As the captain of

00:08:43,791 --> 00:08:46,458
this mission might take
with him in charge.

160
00:08:46,541 --> 00:08:49,208
I fear that his dedication
to Okita Souji might be a--

161
00:08:49,291 --> 00:08:50,416
That's enough.

162
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:54,291
[KASHUU]
He's over it, okay?

163
00:08:54,375 --> 00:08:55,958
[HASEBE]
Are you sure?

164
00:08:56,041 --> 00:08:58,833
[KASHUU] Okita Souji isn't the
one who is wielding us anymore.

165
00:08:58,916 --> 00:09:00,708
He's accepted that.

166
00:09:00,791 --> 00:09:03,291
[KASHUU] He's loyal to
the master, just like I am.

167
00:09:05,416 --> 00:09:07,458
[HASEBE]
He still seemed rather uneasy.

168
00:09:07,541 --> 00:09:09,458
[KASHUU]
He's strong now.

169
00:09:09,541 --> 00:09:11,750
In his heart as well.
I believe in him.

170
00:09:13,458 --> 00:09:15,791
Watch his back. Just be safe.

171
00:09:17,291 --> 00:09:18,708
Okay, I will.

172
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
[KANESADA] So what do the
bad guys wanna do here

173
00:09:27,083 --> 00:09:28,833
in the first place?

174
00:09:28,916 --> 00:09:30,583
Attack the Shinsengumi
and make sure

175
00:09:30,666 --> 00:09:33,250
the anti-shogunate ronin
stay alive, we assume.

176
00:09:33,333 --> 00:09:34,791
That would make sense.

177
00:09:34,875 --> 00:09:37,125
If they turned Kyoto into a
sea of fire like they planned,

178
00:09:37,208 --> 00:09:39,458
that would certainly
change history.

179
00:09:39,541 --> 00:09:42,000
So that's how the
enemy operates, is it?

180
00:09:42,083 --> 00:09:44,583
[KASHUU] They don't exactly
talk, so we can only guess.

181
00:09:44,666 --> 00:09:46,125
[YASUSADA] Our objective
is to head them off

182
00:09:46,208 --> 00:09:48,958
before they launch an
attack on the Shinsengumi.

183
00:09:49,041 --> 00:09:52,208
They'll be lying in wait,
either inside the Ikedaya Inn

184
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:54,375
or somewhere in
the surrounding area.

185
00:09:54,458 --> 00:09:58,125
That's handy info, Captain,
but what's the plan?

186
00:09:58,208 --> 00:10:01,291
On that day, the Shinsengumi
split into the Kondou unit

187
00:10:01,375 --> 00:10:02,875
and the Hijikata unit.

188
00:10:02,958 --> 00:10:04,916
They were searching for
the anti-shogunate ronin

189
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,083
lurking somewhere
in the city of Kyoto.

190
00:10:08,166 --> 00:10:09,833
The Kondou unit
spotted the ronin

191
00:10:09,916 --> 00:10:11,375
as they entered the Inn.

192
00:10:11,458 --> 00:10:14,250
Then, four of the Shinsengumi
stormed in from the front.

193
00:10:14,333 --> 00:10:17,333
Kondou, Nagakura,
Toudou and Souji.

194
00:10:17,416 --> 00:10:19,125
Is that how you remember it?

195
00:10:19,208 --> 00:10:20,000
[NAGASONE]
Yeah.

196
00:10:20,083 --> 00:10:21,208
[KASHUU]
How could I forget?

197
00:10:21,291 --> 00:10:23,000
When they made their way
to the second floor,

198
00:10:23,083 --> 00:10:25,708
a fight broke out
with the enemy ronin.

199
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:28,166
If we can, we should
lure the Retrograde Army

200
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:31,416
to the first floor or the
backyard to avoid notice.

201
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:32,916
Worst case scenario,

202
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,041
we engage them on the second
floor, away from the ronin.

203
00:10:36,125 --> 00:10:38,125
We'll split into two groups.

204
00:10:38,208 --> 00:10:41,208
Nagasone, Mutsunokami,
Kiyomitsu,

205
00:10:41,291 --> 00:10:43,708
and I will storm the entrance.

206
00:10:43,791 --> 00:10:46,791
Kanesada and Horikawa
will fight in the backyard.

207
00:10:46,875 --> 00:10:48,500
We'll have you wear
the Shinsengumi's coats

208
00:10:48,583 --> 00:10:51,166
to fool the enemy
into following you.

209
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:52,958
[KANESADA]
All right, piece of cake.

210
00:10:53,041 --> 00:10:55,916
Huh! I didn't think you'd
pair me with Nagasone!

211
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:56,833
That's great!

212
00:10:56,916 --> 00:10:58,125
Once he sees me in action,

213
00:10:58,208 --> 00:10:59,708
I'll prove once and
for all that the gun

214
00:10:59,791 --> 00:11:01,583
is mightier than the sword.

215
00:11:01,666 --> 00:11:03,375
Then maybe he can
get one for himself!

216
00:11:03,458 --> 00:11:05,083
Don't underestimate my resolve--

217
00:11:05,166 --> 00:11:07,208
You might be begging
me for a lesson.

218
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:09,791
[YASUSADA] Okay, okay,
settle this when you get back.

219
00:11:09,875 --> 00:11:12,583
Like Hasebe said,
we need teamwork right now.

220
00:11:12,666 --> 00:11:15,916
Anyway, when you've defeated the
enemy, let's meet on the roof.

221
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,416
Why? Is there
something up there?

222
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:20,333
No, which is why
no one will see us.

223
00:11:20,416 --> 00:11:21,666
All right then, everyone.

224
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:22,750
Let's get going!

225
00:11:22,833 --> 00:11:23,833
[ALL]
Right!

226
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:28,708
[KANESADA chuckles]

227
00:11:29,791 --> 00:11:30,833
Nice!

228
00:11:30,916 --> 00:11:32,208
That coat's a good
look for you, Kane.

229
00:11:44,416 --> 00:11:46,333
[YASUSADA]
Do you remember this?

230
00:11:46,416 --> 00:11:47,833
Huh?

231
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:51,333
[laughs] Well, I gave
it to you, didn't I?

232
00:11:51,416 --> 00:11:52,583
[YASUSADA]
It's a reminder.

233
00:11:52,666 --> 00:11:55,041
I'll never be that
reckless or selfish again.

234
00:11:57,291 --> 00:11:58,666
You're wearing
it on the mission?

235
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:00,166
Yeah, to keep me in check.

236
00:12:01,791 --> 00:12:03,208
[KASHUU]
We still have a minute.

237
00:12:03,291 --> 00:12:04,541
Could we talk?

238
00:12:08,625 --> 00:12:10,958
[gasps] There's one over here!

239
00:12:11,041 --> 00:12:12,166
[AKITA]
And here, too!

240
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:14,625
There's flowers on the tree!

241
00:12:14,708 --> 00:12:15,708
Flowers?

242
00:12:15,791 --> 00:12:17,166
That's right.

243
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:18,833
Even though it's winter,
the cherry tree is gracing us

244
00:12:18,916 --> 00:12:20,041
with a few blooms.

245
00:12:20,125 --> 00:12:20,916
[KASHUU]
Huh...

246
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,333
[YASUSADA]
Really?

247
00:12:22,416 --> 00:12:23,708
[ICHIGO] I thought I would
have to wait until spring

248
00:12:23,791 --> 00:12:25,625
to see the cherry blossoms
with my brothers,

249
00:12:25,708 --> 00:12:26,875
so I'm quite grateful.

250
00:12:26,958 --> 00:12:29,458
Yeah, I thought it was
done blooming for sure!

251
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:31,208
What kind of tree
has cherry blossoms

252
00:12:31,291 --> 00:12:33,333
that bloom in the
middle of November?

253
00:12:33,416 --> 00:12:36,125
We thought it was a
ten thousand leaf cherry tree.

254
00:12:36,208 --> 00:12:38,083
But it may be something
more than that.

255
00:12:38,166 --> 00:12:40,708
We cannot fathom
the logic of this tree.

256
00:12:40,791 --> 00:12:43,000
In that regard,
it's like the master.

257
00:12:43,083 --> 00:12:44,791
I wouldn't expect
a tree to be exciting,

258
00:12:44,875 --> 00:12:47,166
but this one really does its
best to mix things up.

259
00:12:53,958 --> 00:12:57,291
[KASHUU] Hey, speaking of
the tree, do you remember this?

260
00:12:57,375 --> 00:12:58,416
Is that...

261
00:12:59,583 --> 00:13:00,666
...my wish?

262
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:02,750
Why did you keep that?

263
00:13:02,833 --> 00:13:04,583
[KASHUU] Because I knew
we'd eventually return

264
00:13:04,666 --> 00:13:05,791
to this mission,

265
00:13:05,875 --> 00:13:07,875
and I wanted to show it
to you when we did.

266
00:13:10,291 --> 00:13:12,125
[KASHUU]
Still having that dream?

267
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:15,416
I didn't want to ask, but since
we're going to the Ikedaya Inn,

268
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:16,750
I am curious.

269
00:13:18,083 --> 00:13:19,041
Yeah.

270
00:13:20,375 --> 00:13:22,666
Sometimes, at least.

271
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:26,250
And in case you're wondering,
I still look up to Souji.

272
00:13:26,333 --> 00:13:28,041
I still care about him.

273
00:13:28,125 --> 00:13:29,416
But even if that's the same,

274
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:32,291
that doesn't mean I haven't
changed in other ways.

275
00:13:32,375 --> 00:13:34,375
I think I've grown up
at least a little.

276
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:38,333
I'm fighting for
the citadel now.

277
00:13:38,416 --> 00:13:41,750
I'm fighting in the name
of our new master.

278
00:13:41,833 --> 00:13:43,541
Look in my eyes and see.

279
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:56,583
Guess we don't need
your wish anymore.

280
00:13:56,666 --> 00:13:58,791
[YASUSADA] Then you're
leaving your charm empty?

281
00:14:00,208 --> 00:14:02,250
[KASHUU]
No, I still have this.

282
00:14:02,333 --> 00:14:04,666
It's cuter than an old
sheet of paper, right?

283
00:14:07,625 --> 00:14:09,291
[HASEBE] When these
cherry blossoms bloom,

284
00:14:09,375 --> 00:14:12,208
I want the master to be able
to see them without any worry

285
00:14:12,291 --> 00:14:13,583
in their heart.

286
00:14:13,666 --> 00:14:16,750
For that to happen,
you have to make it back safely.

287
00:14:16,833 --> 00:14:18,833
And with smiles on
all your faces, too.

288
00:14:18,916 --> 00:14:19,875
Well...

289
00:14:19,958 --> 00:14:22,375
I'm sure you'll
perform splendidly.

290
00:14:22,458 --> 00:14:23,250
We'll be waiting.

291
00:14:23,333 --> 00:14:24,875
Give it your best out there!

292
00:14:27,125 --> 00:14:29,041
We're counting on you!

293
00:14:29,125 --> 00:14:29,791
Yeah!

294
00:14:29,875 --> 00:14:32,041
Good luck, guys!

295
00:14:32,125 --> 00:14:33,166
[KASHUU, YASUSADA chuckling]

296
00:14:39,166 --> 00:14:42,916
[HACHISUKA] If you break,
I won't forgive you.

297
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,166
I know.

298
00:14:46,541 --> 00:14:47,625
Let's party!

299
00:14:47,708 --> 00:14:49,625
A little drink will
liven things up!

300
00:14:49,708 --> 00:14:50,791
Or a big one!

301
00:14:50,875 --> 00:14:52,208
I'd go for a drink of tea.

302
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:53,375
Nakigitsune!

303
00:14:53,458 --> 00:14:55,125
Can you make some <i>inarizushi</i> ?

304
00:14:55,208 --> 00:14:56,541
I'll bring some desserts!

305
00:14:56,625 --> 00:14:58,708
We're dealing with a
serious situation here!

306
00:14:58,791 --> 00:15:00,625
At least wait until they get
back from their mission!

307
00:15:00,708 --> 00:15:02,041
What if someone dies out there?

308
00:15:02,125 --> 00:15:03,250
Don't worry!

309
00:15:03,333 --> 00:15:04,541
They'll be fine!

310
00:15:04,625 --> 00:15:06,166
And it's not like we're going!

311
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:08,416
Let them have
their party, Hasebe.

312
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:10,666
You should be used to
this sort of thing by now.

313
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:12,291
[HASEBE groans]

314
00:15:12,375 --> 00:15:15,375
Gah. I suppose there's
no dissuading you.

315
00:15:15,458 --> 00:15:17,833
All right, let's get
this party started!

316
00:15:17,916 --> 00:15:19,500
[ALL]
Yeah!

317
00:15:19,583 --> 00:15:22,125
We'll be back
before you're finished!

318
00:15:22,208 --> 00:15:23,833
All right, team. Let's go!

319
00:15:41,041 --> 00:15:43,375
Let's split into two groups,
just like we planned.

320
00:15:43,458 --> 00:15:45,333
We're off to the backyard, then.

321
00:15:45,416 --> 00:15:46,875
I'm sure we'll do fine.

322
00:15:49,291 --> 00:15:51,291
Be sure to show everyone
how cool you are!

323
00:15:51,375 --> 00:15:53,583
Come on, who do you
think you're talking to?

324
00:16:09,166 --> 00:16:10,041
[NAGASONE]
Let me take point.

325
00:16:10,125 --> 00:16:11,208
I'll open the door.

326
00:16:14,125 --> 00:16:15,125
Let's move.

327
00:16:23,125 --> 00:16:25,291
Well, this is quite
the welcoming party.

328
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:28,833
Back off me!

329

[KASHUU laughing]

330
00:16:30,333 --> 00:16:32,333
That's the problem
with being popular.

331
00:16:32,416 --> 00:16:34,750
Everyone wants a piece of you!

332
00:16:34,833 --> 00:16:37,208
Save the joking for later;
this is dangerous!

333
00:16:37,291 --> 00:16:38,958
My apologies, Captain.

334
00:16:39,041 --> 00:16:40,583
Do what you like,
but don't you blame me

335
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:42,041
if you end up broken.

336
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,375
That doesn't sound
appealing at all.

337
00:16:46,458 --> 00:16:48,000
Guess I'd better get serious.

338

[NAGASONE yells]

339
00:16:55,208 --> 00:16:57,458

Come and get us!

343

Hey, Kunihiro?

344
00:17:13,208 --> 00:17:14,791
[KANESADA]
Seems like an awful lot of them.

345
00:17:14,875 --> 00:17:17,125
My three-step thrust is
much stronger than before!

346
00:17:17,208 --> 00:17:18,916
I've been training for this!

347
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,833
Now die!

348
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:28,791
[NAGASONE groans]

349
00:17:31,958 --> 00:17:34,625
Don't worry, Captain,
this is barely even a scratch.

350
00:17:35,416 --> 00:17:37,500
I will end you!

351
00:17:40,083 --> 00:17:41,833
[YASUSADA]
To oblivion, you devil.

That was amazing!

357
00:17:57,791 --> 00:17:59,458
Would you expect any less?

358
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:06,500
Are you looking
for a duel with me?

359
00:18:06,583 --> 00:18:08,333
Huh? Damn it, come back!

360

Hey, Captain!

361
00:18:09,458 --> 00:18:11,000
I'm heading up
to the second floor!

362
00:18:11,083 --> 00:18:12,750
Just don't let
the ronin see you!

363
00:18:14,875 --> 00:18:16,583
[YASUSADA] And don't die
up there, either.

364
00:18:18,666 --> 00:18:20,166
It's awfully noisy out there.

365
00:18:26,791 --> 00:18:28,458
Yeah, but I don't see anybody.

You know what to do, right?

Yeah, I'm ready now!

Thanks for the save,
but any closer

381
00:19:39,916 --> 00:19:42,000
and you would've cut me
clean in half as well.

If you were that slow,

I'd just be putting you
out of your misery.

There any more?

389
00:20:24,541 --> 00:20:26,125
Only their leader, I think.

390
00:20:26,208 --> 00:20:28,333
Yamatonokami is handling it.

I'm not worried, then.

like a fine piece of work.
