1
00:00:08,375 --> 00:00:10,791
[HORIKAWA]
The year is 2205 AD.

2
00:00:17,166 --> 00:00:20,125
The History Retrograde Army
seeks to control the world

3
00:00:20,208 --> 00:00:21,791
by altering its past.

4
00:00:22,958 --> 00:00:25,000
Born from the heart of swords,

5
00:00:25,083 --> 00:00:28,708
we travel through time to
intercept and eliminate them.

6
00:00:30,166 --> 00:00:32,416
Hey, has anyone seen Kane?

7
00:02:03,625 --> 00:02:05,208
[KASHUU, YASUSADA]
This is a tale of the Legendary

8
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:07,666
Sword Warriors
and the Hanamaru days

9
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:10,458
they spent in
a certain citadel.

10
00:02:18,958 --> 00:02:19,958
[squelching noise]

11
00:02:21,458 --> 00:02:22,416
[gasps]

12
00:02:26,666 --> 00:02:28,000
[YASUSADA]
That dream again.

13
00:02:31,333 --> 00:02:32,625
Ah!

14
00:02:32,708 --> 00:02:35,208
[laughs] All done with
my chores for the day.

15
00:02:35,291 --> 00:02:37,125
All done stuffing my face.

16
00:02:37,208 --> 00:02:38,125
Now, what's next?

17
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:39,083
Cherry blossoms!

18
00:02:39,166 --> 00:02:41,208
Oh! Good idea!

19
00:02:41,291 --> 00:02:43,500
[TAROUTACHI] Didn't you watch
the cherry blossoms yesterday

20
00:02:43,583 --> 00:02:44,708
and the day before?

21
00:02:44,791 --> 00:02:46,416
What are we supposed to do?

22
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,708
We've got this beautiful
cherry tree here.

23
00:02:48,791 --> 00:02:50,666
If we didn't watch
its blossoms fall,

24
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:52,625
wouldn't that be
rude to the tree?

25
00:02:52,708 --> 00:02:55,500
I dunno what to think
about you, Jiroutachi.

26
00:02:55,583 --> 00:02:57,625
Except you've got
a way with language!

27
00:02:57,708 --> 00:02:59,000
I know!

28
00:02:59,083 --> 00:03:00,833
Well, sounds like a date, then!

29
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,416
Sword Warriors, assemble
beneath the cherry tree!

30
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:06,083
We're watching the blooms!

31
00:03:06,166 --> 00:03:07,250
[HASEBE]
Cut that out!

32
00:03:07,333 --> 00:03:08,791
Our sacred bell is
for official business,

33
00:03:08,875 --> 00:03:10,125
not your foolish whims!

34
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:11,708
The master would be
deeply disappointed

35
00:03:11,791 --> 00:03:12,625
if they heard of this!

36
00:03:12,708 --> 00:03:13,750
Let's have a picnic!

37
00:03:13,833 --> 00:03:14,750
Sounds like fun!

38
00:03:14,833 --> 00:03:16,791
Why not, right?

39
00:03:16,875 --> 00:03:18,000
Well...

40
00:03:18,083 --> 00:03:20,083
Like it or not,
the bell gets the job done.

41
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:23,333
[KASHUU]
The Ikedaya Inn?

42
00:03:23,416 --> 00:03:26,250
And you've had this dream
a bunch of times before?

43
00:03:26,333 --> 00:03:27,083
Uh-huh.

44
00:03:27,166 --> 00:03:29,333
With me by Souji's side.

45
00:03:29,416 --> 00:03:31,750
As a normal sword, that is.

46
00:03:31,833 --> 00:03:33,125
No mistaking it.

47
00:03:33,208 --> 00:03:36,583
Sure. I mean, you can't
argue with a dream, right?

48
00:03:36,666 --> 00:03:38,250
[HORIKAWA] But you're the
one who was actually there,

49
00:03:38,333 --> 00:03:40,041
right, Kashuu?

50
00:03:40,125 --> 00:03:41,375
I don't get it.

51
00:03:41,458 --> 00:03:43,708
C'mon! Tell me!

52
00:03:43,791 --> 00:03:45,125
What does it mean?
What does it mean?

53
00:03:45,208 --> 00:03:47,375
It's gotta be something, right?

54
00:03:47,458 --> 00:03:49,375
I don't know,
maybe you just wanted him

55
00:03:49,458 --> 00:03:50,791
to take you instead of me?

56
00:03:50,875 --> 00:03:52,375
That's not it!

57
00:03:52,458 --> 00:03:55,583
Although I would've
been honored to go.

58
00:03:55,666 --> 00:03:58,250
I know it was you that
Souji chose, not me,

59
00:03:58,333 --> 00:04:02,416
and I respect that decision,
even if it does make me upset.

60
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:03,666
Don't be dramatic.

61
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:05,791
That doesn't mean that
you're any less worthy.

62
00:04:05,875 --> 00:04:07,583
He just wanted me that time.

63
00:04:07,666 --> 00:04:09,125
Is that so awful?

64
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:12,333
[YASUSADA] No, but this dream
thing is still bugging me.

65
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:13,250
[HASEBE]
Excuse me.

66
00:04:13,333 --> 00:04:14,416
Do you have a moment?

67
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:15,458
Sure.

68
00:04:15,541 --> 00:04:17,625
Oh. Must be
another lecture, huh?

69
00:04:17,708 --> 00:04:18,875
[door opens]

70
00:04:18,958 --> 00:04:21,458
Horikawa, you were made
the secretary, correct?

71
00:04:21,541 --> 00:04:22,416
[HORIKAWA]
That's right.

72
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:23,833
I have a job for you.

73
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:28,958
[HASEBE] This is your
first time on the job,

74
00:04:29,041 --> 00:04:30,291
so I'll be frank with you.

75
00:04:30,375 --> 00:04:32,708
The master of our citadel,
to put it nicely,

76
00:04:32,791 --> 00:04:33,916
is a bit of a homebody.

77
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,208
[HORIKAWA]
They're as big as a house?

78
00:04:35,291 --> 00:04:37,166
[HASEBE] No! Why would
you--never mind.

79
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:40,000
The point is they don't
like to leave their room.

80
00:04:40,083 --> 00:04:41,708
That is why they
made this <i>shiki</i> ,

81
00:04:41,791 --> 00:04:44,166
which can recreate
the powers of the Sage.

82
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:46,500
With it, anyone can
manifest Sword Warriors

83
00:04:46,583 --> 00:04:48,041
in place of the master.

84
00:04:49,041 --> 00:04:50,791
[HORIKAWA]
This is all you need?

85
00:04:50,875 --> 00:04:53,500
Our job is to
care for the master.

86
00:04:53,583 --> 00:04:56,416
So if they want to stay in
their room and relax all day,

87
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,166
we'll help them with that.

88
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:00,458
We must perform duties
both great and small

89
00:05:00,541 --> 00:05:02,375
to show our boundless
loyalty and...

90
00:05:06,125 --> 00:05:08,333
[KASHUU]
I hope he shows up soon.

91
00:05:08,416 --> 00:05:10,708
[YASUSADA]
Izuminokami Kanesada?

92
00:05:10,791 --> 00:05:13,583
Kane, Kane, Kane,
all day every day.

93
00:05:13,666 --> 00:05:15,625
Only thing Horikawa
ever talks about.

94
00:05:15,708 --> 00:05:17,125
That's only natural.

95
00:05:17,208 --> 00:05:18,958
Well, 'cause of their owner.

96
00:05:19,041 --> 00:05:21,500
I'm sure they were
close to Hijikata.

97
00:05:21,583 --> 00:05:25,250
So were we, since he was in
the Shinsengumi like Souji.

98
00:05:25,333 --> 00:05:26,541
[KASHUU]
I suppose.

99
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:28,875
Were you lonely?

100
00:05:28,958 --> 00:05:30,875
I mean, you had to wait
a long time for me.

101
00:05:30,958 --> 00:05:32,166
Ugh! No!

102
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:33,750
It wasn't like that.

103
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:36,750
How can you say something like
that with such a straight face?

104
00:05:39,333 --> 00:05:44,916
[HORIKAWA] C'mon, Kane,
Kane, Kane, Kane, Kane...

105
00:05:53,083 --> 00:05:56,166
I am Hijikata Toshizou's
beloved sword.

106
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:57,833
Both strong and cool.

107
00:05:57,916 --> 00:06:00,041
Obviously, my reputation
speaks for itself--

108
00:06:00,125 --> 00:06:01,541
[HORIKAWA]
You made it!

109
00:06:01,625 --> 00:06:03,541
Jeez, at least let me finish.

110
00:06:03,625 --> 00:06:05,000
Kane!

111
00:06:05,083 --> 00:06:07,125
Sorry to make
you wait, Kunihiro.

112
00:06:09,916 --> 00:06:11,166
[HORIKAWA]
Let me give you a tour.

113
00:06:12,666 --> 00:06:13,750
Oh, hey, Hasebe!

114
00:06:13,833 --> 00:06:15,416
Well! That was fast!

115
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:18,166
I am Master's attendant,
Heshikiri Hasebe.

116
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:19,416
Nice to meet you.

117
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:20,291
Thank you.

118
00:06:20,375 --> 00:06:21,791
I'm happy I could make it here.

119
00:06:21,875 --> 00:06:24,625
If there's anything you're
unsure of regarding the citadel,

120
00:06:24,708 --> 00:06:26,458
feel free to ask me.

121
00:06:26,541 --> 00:06:28,375
Can I meet my new master?

122
00:06:28,458 --> 00:06:30,583
Maybe. Shall we go and find out?

123
00:06:30,666 --> 00:06:31,458
It's okay.

124
00:06:31,541 --> 00:06:33,416
I can show him around myself.

125
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:34,625
Come with me.

126
00:06:34,708 --> 00:06:35,708
All right.

127
00:06:41,541 --> 00:06:43,750
Nice to see Horikawa so happy.

128
00:06:46,583 --> 00:06:47,666
[KANESADA]
Thanks, I guess.

129
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:49,708
But where am I supposed
to put this thing?

130
00:06:49,791 --> 00:06:51,041
Sorry 'bout that.

131
00:06:51,125 --> 00:06:53,208
Let me take it; I'll come
up with something later.

132
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:57,916
So, our job as Sword Warriors

133
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
is to travel through time
and protect history.

134
00:07:01,083 --> 00:07:03,458
You heard it straight from
the master's mouth, right?

135
00:07:03,541 --> 00:07:05,416
Did you still have
some questions?

136
00:07:07,875 --> 00:07:09,041
Nah.

137
00:07:09,125 --> 00:07:11,375
In that case, I'll show
you to our room, c'mon.

138
00:07:11,458 --> 00:07:12,541
"Our" room?

139
00:07:12,625 --> 00:07:14,458
We don't have to share
with anyone else?

140
00:07:14,541 --> 00:07:15,666
[HORIKAWA chuckles]

141
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,291
[KANESADA]
Kunihiro, could I get--

142
00:07:21,375 --> 00:07:22,416
[HORIKAWA]
A snack?

143
00:07:31,625 --> 00:07:33,083
I'll take care of that.

144
00:07:33,166 --> 00:07:34,250
You're gonna spoil me.

145
00:07:34,333 --> 00:07:35,625
Come on.

146
00:07:35,708 --> 00:07:36,583
[yawns]

147
00:07:36,666 --> 00:07:37,791
Here.

148
00:07:37,875 --> 00:07:39,750
[KANESADA]
Thanks, but back off a little!

149
00:07:41,916 --> 00:07:44,125
[KANESADA] Wow, that's one
heck of a tree you've got.

150
00:07:44,208 --> 00:07:46,500
[HORIKAWA] It's a ten
thousand leaf cherry tree.

151
00:07:46,583 --> 00:07:50,125
[KANESADA] What's that?
Never heard of one.

152
00:07:50,208 --> 00:07:52,750
It only blooms once
every ten thousand years,

153
00:07:52,833 --> 00:07:54,833
but it can grant
wishes, they say.

154
00:07:54,916 --> 00:07:56,125
[YASUSADA]
All right, I'm ready!

155
00:07:57,333 --> 00:07:58,375
[KANESADA]
What's over there?

156
00:07:58,458 --> 00:07:59,791
[HORIKAWA]
The training hall.

157
00:07:59,875 --> 00:08:00,958
[KASHUU]
Let's do this!

158
00:08:10,083 --> 00:08:11,541
Normally, with a
three-step thrust,

159
00:08:11,625 --> 00:08:13,791
you would stab high,
then middle, then low,

160
00:08:13,875 --> 00:08:15,250
but Souji would
strike three times

161
00:08:15,333 --> 00:08:17,708
in the exact same place instead.

162
00:08:17,791 --> 00:08:20,666
It was so fast that it only
looked like one attack.

163
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,750
So the enemy would
be overwhelmed.

164
00:08:22,833 --> 00:08:23,625
You're right.

165
00:08:23,708 --> 00:08:24,833
I remember that now.

166
00:08:24,916 --> 00:08:26,958
[KANESADA] Hey!
Sorry to keep you waiting!

167
00:08:27,041 --> 00:08:28,833
I am the beloved
sword of Hijikata,

168
00:08:28,916 --> 00:08:30,958
Vice Commander
of the Shinsengumi.

169
00:08:31,041 --> 00:08:32,666
Famously strong and cool,

170
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:35,541
clearly, my reputation
speaks for itself. I am--

171
00:08:35,625 --> 00:08:37,000
[YASUSADA, KASHUU]
Kane!

172
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:38,000
[HORIKAWA laughs]

173
00:08:38,083 --> 00:08:39,458
[KANESADA]
Uh, yes.

174
00:08:39,541 --> 00:08:41,291
Yasusada and Kiyomitsu.

175
00:08:41,375 --> 00:08:42,583
You guys got here early, huh?

176
00:08:42,666 --> 00:08:44,416
Actually, you were just late.

177
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:45,500
Uh-huh.

178
00:08:46,583 --> 00:08:48,375
Either way,
it's good to see you.

179
00:08:49,916 --> 00:08:52,291
[KASHUU] Hijikata was
a pretty scary guy, huh?

180
00:08:52,375 --> 00:08:54,333
He was like a demon, for real.

181
00:08:54,416 --> 00:08:56,666
Yeah, "The Demon Vice
Commander from Hell."

182
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:58,333
Born a demon, raised a demon.

183
00:08:58,416 --> 00:09:00,458
[KASHUU] They say he
didn't even have a soul.

184
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:02,000
You bastards!

185
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:03,708
Are you trying to piss me off
or does it just come natural

186
00:09:03,791 --> 00:09:05,166
to you jerks?

187
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:07,166
You know damn well Hijikata
only acted the way he did

188
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:08,875
so he could be a
better commander!

189
00:09:08,958 --> 00:09:10,375
Back me up, Kunihiro!

190
00:09:10,458 --> 00:09:11,833
[laughing]

191
00:09:11,916 --> 00:09:13,708
Stop laughing, you traitor!

192
00:09:18,416 --> 00:09:19,458
Not bad.

193
00:09:19,541 --> 00:09:21,333
So, seems you have
to train pretty hard

194
00:09:21,416 --> 00:09:23,250
for these missions of yours.

195
00:09:23,333 --> 00:09:24,666
No different than before.

196
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:26,875
The Shinsengumi had a
training hall like this as well.

197
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:28,916
[KANESADA] All right,
I'm just gonna ask you--

198
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,416
Why are you fighting?

199
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:34,250
It's our sworn duty to stop
the History Retrograde Army--

200
00:09:34,333 --> 00:09:36,500
[KANESADA] So you just do
whatever the master tells you?

201
00:09:36,583 --> 00:09:39,166
You're not just swords
now--you're men.

202
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:41,750
Hijikata fought for the
shogunate because in his heart,

203
00:09:41,833 --> 00:09:43,958
he believed that was
the right thing to do.

204
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:46,125
Now, we have a voice
to speak our minds.

205
00:09:46,208 --> 00:09:49,416
So why we're here, what we want
and who we're fighting for

206
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,375
are things that we
should question.

207
00:09:51,458 --> 00:09:53,958
Well, for starters,
I want to be strong, like Souji.

208
00:09:54,041 --> 00:09:55,625
That's why I fight.

209
00:09:55,708 --> 00:09:58,458
And I hope that he
would be proud of me.

210
00:09:58,541 --> 00:10:03,791
Because I loved him and I
admired him as a swordsman.

211
00:10:03,875 --> 00:10:07,958
Protecting history is protecting
his legacy as well.

212
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:09,250
[KANESADA]
Well spoken.

213
00:10:09,333 --> 00:10:11,291
And a worthy goal, too.

214
00:10:11,375 --> 00:10:13,000
But let me be frank.

215
00:10:13,083 --> 00:10:14,541
I saw you sparring before,

216
00:10:14,625 --> 00:10:17,166
and you've still got
quite a long way to go.

217
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:18,666
That's fine.

218
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:20,875
'Cause now you've got a cool
and strong sparring partner

219
00:10:20,958 --> 00:10:22,583
to show you how it's done.

220
00:10:22,666 --> 00:10:23,875
What d'you say?

221
00:10:23,958 --> 00:10:25,250
[laughs]

222
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:26,833
Let's see what you've got.

223
00:10:30,541 --> 00:10:31,875
All right, then.

224
00:10:31,958 --> 00:10:35,166
The Tennen Rishin Style
includes fencing, hand-to hand,

225
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:38,750
staff techniques and uh, uh... 

226
00:10:38,833 --> 00:10:39,625
<i>Iai</i> !

227
00:10:39,708 --> 00:10:41,083
<i>Iai</i> .

228
00:10:41,166 --> 00:10:44,458
Quick-draw sword techniques
to round out your arsenal.

229
00:10:44,541 --> 00:10:47,666
Hijikata's method for
striking is the best, I think.

230
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:49,375
Couldn't agree more!

231
00:10:49,458 --> 00:10:51,875
He used me as his blade
for quite some time,

232
00:10:51,958 --> 00:10:53,666
so I can explain.

233
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:56,125
Normally, because a
sword handle is held firmly

234
00:10:56,208 --> 00:10:57,625
by the pinky and
the ring finger,

235
00:10:57,708 --> 00:11:00,000
the pinky is always
the first to get injured.

236
00:11:00,083 --> 00:11:01,750
However, with my handle,

237
00:11:01,833 --> 00:11:04,166
he would get hurt near
his index finger and thumb.

238
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:06,500
That's because he'd put all his
strength in his index finger

239
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:09,083
every time he would strike.

240
00:11:09,166 --> 00:11:12,250
No one could withstand a blow
from his striking stance.

241
00:11:12,333 --> 00:11:15,375
Without hesitation,
he would thrust like lightning.

242
00:11:15,458 --> 00:11:16,625
Whether it met its mark or not,

243
00:11:16,708 --> 00:11:18,916
he would prepare a
second strike immediately,

244
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,541
then a third and a fourth,
never relenting.

245
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:26,958
You must rain blows upon your
opponent until they submit.

246
00:11:27,041 --> 00:11:29,041
The Tennen Rishin Style
provides an answer

247
00:11:29,125 --> 00:11:31,000
for every possibly outcome.

248
00:11:34,333 --> 00:11:36,583
[KANESADA] All right,
repetitions have their place,

249
00:11:36,666 --> 00:11:38,125
of course.

250
00:11:38,208 --> 00:11:40,625
But nothing can compare to a
real battle with a real weapon.

251
00:11:41,583 --> 00:11:43,375
[KASHUU]
This is a training hall.

252
00:11:43,458 --> 00:11:45,125
Not a murdering hall.

253
00:11:45,208 --> 00:11:46,625
[KANESADA]
Gimme all you got.

254
00:11:46,708 --> 00:11:48,833
Don't worry, I don't think
you're capable of hurting me.

255
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:50,583
I don't need you to egg me on;

256
00:11:50,666 --> 00:11:52,500
my sword always finds its mark.

257
00:11:52,583 --> 00:11:54,500
[KASHUU groans]

258
00:11:54,583 --> 00:11:56,791
[HORIKAWA]
You ready? Begin!

259
00:12:01,625 --> 00:12:02,750
[YASUSADA]
I'll warn you.

260
00:12:02,833 --> 00:12:04,625
I've been training with
Kiyomitsu every day.

261
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:05,958
[YASUSADA grunts]

262
00:12:08,875 --> 00:12:10,041
With my technique,

263
00:12:10,125 --> 00:12:12,458
I can handle anything
you can throw at me.

264
00:12:13,958 --> 00:12:16,291
Two on one?
That's hardly fair!

265
00:12:16,375 --> 00:12:18,291
You said you could
handle anything.

266
00:12:18,375 --> 00:12:20,041
[HORIKAWA yells]

267
00:12:29,375 --> 00:12:31,875
[JIROUTACHI] Forget it.
I'll just go myself.

268
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:38,250
[YASUSADA gasps]

269
00:12:39,333 --> 00:12:40,583
Damn!

270
00:12:40,666 --> 00:12:43,541
I haven't had any time
to train using this body.

271
00:12:43,625 --> 00:12:45,166
What are you idiots doing?

272
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:47,125
They're not fighting
for real, are they?

273
00:12:47,208 --> 00:12:48,583
Stop it!

274
00:12:48,666 --> 00:12:50,875
You just got here today and
you're already acting up?

275
00:12:59,583 --> 00:13:00,666
[YASUSADA yells]

276
00:13:05,666 --> 00:13:07,541
Ha! You said you
wanted to be strong

277
00:13:07,625 --> 00:13:09,291
like your old master, right?

278
00:13:10,666 --> 00:13:13,208
Then what exactly do you
think made him so strong?

279
00:13:15,541 --> 00:13:16,666
[SHINSENGUMI 4A laughing]

280
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:19,208
[YASUSADA]
What made him strong?

281
00:13:19,291 --> 00:13:21,583
Either way, you sure know
how to make us laugh!

282
00:13:21,666 --> 00:13:22,958
You're not just a swordsman;

283
00:13:23,041 --> 00:13:24,916
you're a man of
many talents, huh?

284
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,750
[SHINSENGUMI chattering]

285
00:13:28,958 --> 00:13:29,750
You ready?

286
00:13:29,833 --> 00:13:31,250
Always!

287
00:13:31,333 --> 00:13:33,875
Hijikata's Double attack!

288
00:13:34,916 --> 00:13:36,041
[BOTH grunt]

289
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:39,125
[KANESADA yells]

290
00:13:45,041 --> 00:13:46,041
[HORIKAWA chuckles]

291
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:48,458
[YASUSADA laughs]

292
00:13:48,541 --> 00:13:50,583
[KASHUU] Okay, I don't
think anyone's bleeding.

293
00:13:50,666 --> 00:13:51,666
That's good.

294
00:13:52,583 --> 00:13:54,541
[laughing]

295
00:13:57,083 --> 00:13:59,166
That was decidedly not cool.

296
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:02,375
Still, It can't be a coincidence
that we're all here.

297
00:14:02,458 --> 00:14:06,708
Fighting alongside you
is enough for now.

298
00:14:06,791 --> 00:14:09,166
What's with that face?
Did you remember something?

299
00:14:12,583 --> 00:14:15,083
[YASUSADA] Souji wasn't a hero
because of what he accomplished

300
00:14:15,166 --> 00:14:16,250
in battle.

301
00:14:16,333 --> 00:14:18,833
He was a hero because
he was a good man,

302
00:14:18,916 --> 00:14:22,208
a kind one,
every day of his life.

303
00:14:22,291 --> 00:14:24,333
I don't know if I
can be strong like that,

304
00:14:24,416 --> 00:14:25,708
but I'll try.

305
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:26,541
By the way...

306
00:14:26,625 --> 00:14:27,416
Who are you?

307
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:28,708
Must be new.

308
00:14:30,083 --> 00:14:31,541
Sorry to keep you waiting!

309
00:14:31,625 --> 00:14:34,750
I am the beloved sword
of Vice Commander Hijikata.

310
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:36,625
Famously strong and cool,

311
00:14:36,708 --> 00:14:39,625
clearly, my reputation
speaks for itself.

312
00:14:39,708 --> 00:14:40,875
The one and only...

313
00:14:40,958 --> 00:14:43,333
Sword of the Demon
Vice Commander from Hell!

314
00:14:43,416 --> 00:14:45,208
I'll show you punks
who's a demon!

315
00:14:45,291 --> 00:14:46,291
Yeah, you like that?

316
00:14:46,375 --> 00:14:47,833
Huh? Huh? Yeah?

317
00:14:47,916 --> 00:14:48,875
How 'bout this?

318
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:55,041
[KANESADA] I'll show you
punks who's a demon!

319
00:14:55,125 --> 00:14:56,666
Yeah, you like that? Huh?

320
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:02,625
[KANESADA] Wow, that's
one heck of a tree you've got.

321
00:15:02,708 --> 00:15:05,083
[HORIKAWA] It's a ten
thousand leaf cherry tree.

322
00:15:05,166 --> 00:15:06,916
[KANESADA]
What's that?

323
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,250
Never heard of one.

324
00:15:11,208 --> 00:15:13,166
[chattering]

325
00:15:14,708 --> 00:15:15,750
[MUTSUNOKAMI]
One more!

326
00:15:25,458 --> 00:15:27,958
I've lived such a
short and sheltered life.

327
00:15:28,041 --> 00:15:30,375
In my ignorance, I never
imagined that this world

328
00:15:30,458 --> 00:15:32,041
could possess such beauty.

329
00:15:37,083 --> 00:15:39,291
Jiroutachi, you reek of alcohol.

330
00:15:39,375 --> 00:15:40,750
What do you mean "I reek"?

331
00:15:40,833 --> 00:15:42,166
It smells great!

332
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:44,458
Am I supposed to not
drink when we're having

333
00:15:44,541 --> 00:15:45,916
such a nice party?

334
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,333
Is there no drinking
under the tree?

335
00:15:48,416 --> 00:15:50,541
Is that a rule that I
was not made aware of,

336
00:15:50,625 --> 00:15:52,541
because everyone here hates fun?

337
00:15:52,625 --> 00:15:55,375
Then who let me get drunk
in the first place?

338
00:15:55,458 --> 00:15:56,708
It was you, wasn't it?

339
00:15:56,791 --> 00:15:57,791
Seductress!

340
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,333
Just kidding!

341
00:16:01,416 --> 00:16:03,833
I know you and I have a
relationship of mutual respect!

342
00:16:03,916 --> 00:16:05,208
Muah!

343
00:16:05,291 --> 00:16:08,500
We have an understanding
because my body is 95% saké.

344
00:16:12,083 --> 00:16:13,041
[JIROUTACHI]
Huh?

345
00:16:15,125 --> 00:16:16,625
Where'd you go?

346
00:16:16,708 --> 00:16:18,791
What's the deal, Shokudaikiri?

347
00:16:18,875 --> 00:16:21,125
Why did you let me
run out of saké?

348
00:16:21,208 --> 00:16:22,166
That's your fault.

349
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:24,375
I told you that
was the last of it.

350
00:16:24,458 --> 00:16:26,166
Our human bodies have
brought on a wealth

351
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:29,541
of new experiences,
but we may be overindulging.

352
00:16:29,625 --> 00:16:31,416
You have been drinking
almost every day.

353
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,333
[JIROUTACHI]
Ah!

354
00:16:33,416 --> 00:16:36,041
Tough luck, Jiroutachi.
You gotta cut back!

355
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:39,166
[JIROUTACHI] That is the last
thing I ever wanna hear!

356
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:41,750
You can't pull the rug out
from under me like this!

357
00:16:41,833 --> 00:16:44,958
[sobs] If I can't have saké,
I'm gonna die!

358
00:16:45,041 --> 00:16:46,791
I think his health
may really be in danger!

359
00:16:46,875 --> 00:16:48,875
We can't afford for him
to lose his divine power!

360
00:16:48,958 --> 00:16:51,083
Someone run to the store
and get some saké, quick!

361
00:16:51,166 --> 00:16:52,583
Okay, leave it to me!

362
00:16:52,666 --> 00:16:53,958
C'mon! You too!

363
00:16:54,041 --> 00:16:55,500
Why not? Sounds like fun.

364
00:16:55,583 --> 00:16:57,458
Count me in, you guys!

365
00:16:57,541 --> 00:16:59,375
[HASEBE] Get permission
from the master first,

366
00:16:59,458 --> 00:17:01,791
and buy enough to get
him drunk as a fish!

367
00:17:01,875 --> 00:17:03,041
--[MAEDA] Yes, sir!
--[MIDARE] Okay!

368
00:17:04,666 --> 00:17:06,291
You have our thanks, General!

369
00:17:06,375 --> 00:17:08,500
We won't be gone
too long, promise!

370
00:17:10,083 --> 00:17:11,250
[MIDARE, ATSUSHI]
Shopping time!

371
00:17:11,333 --> 00:17:13,541
[MAEDA]
Don't get carried away, guys.

372
00:17:13,625 --> 00:17:16,458
They sell all
kinds of neat stuff!

373
00:17:16,541 --> 00:17:17,666
[ATSUSHI]
They've got desserts!

374
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:19,375
I'm buying some for everyone!

375
00:17:19,458 --> 00:17:21,541
[MAEDA]
Atsushi, come on.

376
00:17:21,625 --> 00:17:23,541
There's too much!
I don't know what to get!

377
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:24,750
It's cool.

378
00:17:24,833 --> 00:17:26,416
I'll buy some snacks
for us while you decide.

379
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:27,916
Hey, stop that!

380
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,500
Please, let's just get what
we need and hurry back now!

381
00:17:30,583 --> 00:17:31,500
[MIDARE]
Atsushi!

382
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:33,583
What's this? I want it!

383
00:17:33,666 --> 00:17:36,333
[ATSUSHI] It won't hurt if we
only buy one thing each, right?

384
00:17:36,416 --> 00:17:38,083
I know what I'm going with!

385
00:17:38,166 --> 00:17:40,375
[MIDARE]
Umm... well, your choice.

386
00:17:40,458 --> 00:17:41,708
[MAEDA]
Stop it!

387
00:17:41,791 --> 00:17:43,750
Hasebe's going to be mad
if we get a bunch of junk!

388
00:17:43,833 --> 00:17:45,291
[MIDARE, ATSUSHI]
Eh, it'll be fine.

389
00:17:46,541 --> 00:17:47,833
[ATSUSHI, MAEDA, MIDARE]
We're back!

390
00:17:47,916 --> 00:17:48,791
[JIROUTACHI]
Oh, good!

391
00:17:48,875 --> 00:17:50,875
I was at death's door, for sure!

392
00:17:50,958 --> 00:17:52,250
All right, mission accomplished.

393
00:17:52,333 --> 00:17:53,333
Now bring it here and we--

394
00:17:53,416 --> 00:17:54,666
[gasps]

395
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:55,708
Look, guys!

396
00:17:55,791 --> 00:17:57,875
They call this thingie
a face pack!

397
00:17:57,958 --> 00:18:00,291
I bet Ichi would love one, huh?

398
00:18:00,375 --> 00:18:01,708
[HASEBE]
Uh...

399
00:18:01,791 --> 00:18:04,291
Look what I got! Osaka Castle!

400
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:05,500
[HASEBE]
Hmm...

401
00:18:05,583 --> 00:18:07,083
'Kay, one last shot.

402
00:18:07,166 --> 00:18:09,375
Maeda, I trust you
got what we need?

403
00:18:09,458 --> 00:18:10,208
Yep!

404
00:18:10,291 --> 00:18:11,958
And here you go!

405
00:18:12,041 --> 00:18:12,958
[SHOKUDAIKIRI laughing]

406
00:18:13,041 --> 00:18:15,083
Yes. "Drunk as a fish."

407
00:18:15,166 --> 00:18:17,666
I know that's what I told you,
but it's just a saying.

408
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:19,541
[MAEDA whining]

409
00:18:19,625 --> 00:18:21,625
Look what you've
done to this poor man!

410
00:18:21,708 --> 00:18:23,000
[JIROUTACHI sobbing]

411
00:18:23,083 --> 00:18:26,041
Don't worry, I'll go to
the store and get the saké!

412
00:18:26,125 --> 00:18:28,291
I wonder if you can
be trusted on your own.

413
00:18:28,375 --> 00:18:29,708
I think I should tag along.

414
00:18:29,791 --> 00:18:32,208
If you wanna go that bad,
why don't you just say so?

415
00:18:34,875 --> 00:18:37,291
Whoa, I need this, and
this thing too, definitely!

416
00:18:37,375 --> 00:18:40,458
If you're not careful, all that
greed might consume you.

417
00:18:40,541 --> 00:18:42,208
[NAMAZUO] Oh, I have
to have this thing.

418
00:18:42,291 --> 00:18:43,750
Are you kidding me?

419
00:18:43,833 --> 00:18:45,333
[chuckles]
What do you think?

420
00:18:45,416 --> 00:18:47,833
[NIKKARI] I think you should
consider the feelings of others.

421
00:18:47,916 --> 00:18:49,041
[NAMAZUO]
Oh, good idea!

422
00:18:49,125 --> 00:18:50,791
Let's buy a whole bunch
of these lunchboxes!

423
00:18:50,875 --> 00:18:52,500
I bet everybody'll love them!

424
00:18:52,583 --> 00:18:54,041
[NIKKARI]
Hopefully Hasebe at least,

425
00:18:54,125 --> 00:18:56,833
since you're spending his money.

426
00:18:56,916 --> 00:18:59,083
You don't see anything
you're interested in?

427
00:18:59,166 --> 00:19:00,458
I don't know.

428
00:19:03,166 --> 00:19:05,333
[LAUGHING BAG laughing]

429
00:19:05,416 --> 00:19:06,458
[NAMAZUO]
What's that?

430
00:19:09,541 --> 00:19:11,625
[NIKKARI]
We've returned, bearing gifts.

431
00:19:11,708 --> 00:19:12,875
Like saké?

432
00:19:12,958 --> 00:19:15,125
Something far better,
I assure you.

433
00:19:15,208 --> 00:19:16,916
Here, give it a little squeeze.

434
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:22,375
[LAUGHING BAG laughing]

435
00:19:22,458 --> 00:19:23,791
It's a laughing bag!

436
00:19:23,875 --> 00:19:25,416
It puts your heart
at ease, right?

437
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:28,291
Like seeing a dear old friend.

438
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:30,875
You're right.
It is quite reassuring.

439
00:19:30,958 --> 00:19:31,750
[MIDARE]
Huh?!

440
00:19:31,833 --> 00:19:34,708
[LAUGHING BAG laughing]

441
00:19:34,791 --> 00:19:37,541
I am absolutely
frothing with rage!

442
00:19:37,625 --> 00:19:40,791
Octopus, squid, conger eel,
young yellowtail...!

443
00:19:40,875 --> 00:19:43,541
He's so upset he
can only speak in sushi.

444
00:19:43,625 --> 00:19:46,250
Don't worry, buddy,
I'll get that saké for you.

445
00:19:46,333 --> 00:19:48,958
C'mon, Yamanbagiri, let's go.

446
00:19:49,041 --> 00:19:50,708
But why... me?

447
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:02,416
I see.

448
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,500
This one suits me
best after all.

449
00:20:04,583 --> 00:20:06,250
[MUTSUNOKAMI]
Hey, man! Smile!

450
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:09,500
[MUTSUNOKAMI]
Now, let's see.

451
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:13,875
[chuckles]

452
00:20:13,958 --> 00:20:15,500
Yep. We need this.

453
00:20:15,583 --> 00:20:16,750
[YAMANBAGIRI]
If you say so.

454
00:20:20,291 --> 00:20:21,541
[YAMANBAGIRI]
Well hello, there.

455
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:26,875
[YAMANBAGIRI]
I'll take you.

456
00:20:29,291 --> 00:20:30,708
[JIROUTACHI]
What is happening?

457
00:20:33,875 --> 00:20:35,875
C'mon, Mitsubou,
we gotta fix this!

458
00:20:35,958 --> 00:20:38,416
We'll save you, okay?
Just hold on a sec!

459
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,166
Your saké is on its way now!

460
00:20:41,208 --> 00:20:43,166
[HASEBE]
You just want an excuse to go!

461
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,250
[SHOKUDAIKIRI]
Oh, that reminds me,

462
00:20:45,333 --> 00:20:46,541
we're out of eggs.

463
00:20:46,625 --> 00:20:48,291
I should've checked
the refrigerator to see

464
00:20:48,375 --> 00:20:49,708
if we needed anything else.

465
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:51,083
[TSURUMARU]
Hey, it's that dancing flower

466
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:52,333
Yamanbagiri bought!

467
00:20:52,416 --> 00:20:53,416
Should we get another one?

468
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:54,791
Can't have too many, right?

469
00:20:54,875 --> 00:20:56,833
Never mind!
Check out these glasses!

470
00:20:57,958 --> 00:20:58,916
Now it's night!

471
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,291
Hey, that's handy!

472
00:21:00,375 --> 00:21:02,166
These must be training
glasses for swordsmen,

473
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:04,833
so they can practice night
battles even during the day!

474
00:21:04,916 --> 00:21:07,250
The future really is bright.

475
00:21:07,333 --> 00:21:09,333
Oh! These make it
look like sunset.

476
00:21:09,416 --> 00:21:11,125
[TSURUMARU]
And they make you look awesome!

477
00:21:11,208 --> 00:21:12,375
[SHOKUDAIKIRI]
You think so?

478
00:21:12,458 --> 00:21:13,583
Thanks!

479
00:21:13,666 --> 00:21:14,750
I know they're awesome,

480
00:21:14,833 --> 00:21:16,625
but did you have to
buy the entire rack?

481
00:21:16,708 --> 00:21:18,041
It'd be a shame
if I didn't get enough

482
00:21:18,125 --> 00:21:19,875
to share with everyone.

483
00:21:19,958 --> 00:21:20,916
Forget it.

484
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,750
I'll just go myself. Huh?

485
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:27,333
What are you idiots doing?

486
00:21:27,416 --> 00:21:29,333
They're not fighting
for real, are they?

487
00:21:29,416 --> 00:21:30,666
[JIROUTACHI sighs]

488
00:21:31,833 --> 00:21:33,208
[HASEBE]
Stop it!

489
00:21:33,291 --> 00:21:35,541
You just got here today and
you're already acting up?

490
00:21:44,041 --> 00:21:47,125
I've returned from
the gates of hell!

491
00:21:47,208 --> 00:21:48,708
[KANESADA]
You little pests!

492
00:21:48,791 --> 00:21:50,791
[ALL laughing]

493
00:21:53,291 --> 00:21:55,083
You're the new
recruit, aren't you?

494
00:21:55,166 --> 00:21:56,833
Here! Have a little drinky!

495
00:21:56,916 --> 00:21:58,500
You stink!

496
00:21:58,583 --> 00:21:59,833
[JIROUTACHI]
I'm fragrant!

497
00:21:59,916 --> 00:22:00,750
Don't be shy!

498
00:22:00,833 --> 00:22:01,833
[KANESADA]
Stop touching me!

499
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:03,500
[HASEBE gasps]

500
00:22:21,375 --> 00:22:22,416
[MAEDA]
There we go.

501
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:24,708
[laughing]
