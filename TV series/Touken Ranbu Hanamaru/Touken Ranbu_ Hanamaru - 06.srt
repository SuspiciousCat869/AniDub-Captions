00:14:47,458 --> 00:14:48,833
Ah! Like this one?

315
00:14:50,583 --> 00:14:51,916
[YAMABUSHI]
Hold on tight!

316
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,625
[HAKATA]
No problem!

317
00:14:53,708 --> 00:14:55,375
All right, coming up!

318
00:14:55,458 --> 00:14:56,666
I got this.

319
00:14:58,125 --> 00:14:59,625
Or not!

320
00:15:01,958 --> 00:15:03,750
[YAMABUSHI]
If at first you don't succeed,

321
00:15:03,833 --> 00:15:07,083
then my roaring muscles
shall deliver you once more!

322
00:15:07,166 --> 00:15:09,791
--Heave-ho!
--[HAKATA] Bombs away!

323
00:15:12,666 --> 00:15:14,750
[MUTSUNOKAMI]
Hey, these things are red!

324
00:15:14,833 --> 00:15:15,916
Maybe so.

325
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,833
But I don't think
that's the right fruit.

326
00:15:17,916 --> 00:15:19,000
They look good.

327
00:15:19,083 --> 00:15:20,083
I'm gonna try one.

328
00:15:20,166 --> 00:15:22,375
Ugh! If you get sick,
don't blame me.

329
00:15:22,458 --> 00:15:24,291
I gotta try.

330
00:15:24,375 --> 00:15:26,291
I mean, it could be awesome.

331
00:15:26,375 --> 00:15:28,333
Then I'll grab some
for Shokudaikiri.

332
00:15:30,208 --> 00:15:31,583
[retching]

333
00:15:33,416 --> 00:15:34,916
[KASHUU]
Oh, wow, that's nice.

334
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,208
I was thirsty.

335
00:15:38,083 --> 00:15:40,041
[OTEGINE yells]
Help! Kashuu!

336
00:15:40,125 --> 00:15:41,583
What's wrong with you?

337
00:15:41,666 --> 00:15:42,541
Whew, that was a close one.

338
00:15:42,625 --> 00:15:43,625
Ha. Nice save.

339
00:15:43,708 --> 00:15:44,500
[yells]

340
00:15:44,583 --> 00:15:45,875
Well... So long.

341
00:15:45,958 --> 00:15:47,333
[OTEGINE]
Kashuu!

342
00:15:47,416 --> 00:15:49,375
Plenty of trees, but
not the one that we need.

343
00:15:49,458 --> 00:15:50,250
[HAKATA]
Ouch!

344
00:15:50,333 --> 00:15:52,208
What's wrong? A trap?

345
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:55,166
I'll be okay.

346
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:56,625
Just gimme a minute here.

347
00:15:56,708 --> 00:15:57,583
Careful!

348
00:15:57,666 --> 00:15:59,000
Don't push yourself!

349
00:16:00,791 --> 00:16:03,041
Well, I suppose we
had better head back now.

350
00:16:03,125 --> 00:16:04,041
[HAKATA]
Are you kidding me?

351
00:16:04,125 --> 00:16:05,750
I'll do whatever it takes.

352
00:16:05,833 --> 00:16:09,208
We can't abandon the mission
when we've come this far.

353
00:16:09,291 --> 00:16:12,166
It's only been a few days
since I've come to the citadel,

354
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:15,541
but I want to help the
master however I can.

355
00:16:15,625 --> 00:16:19,041
I want to be strong like
all the other Sword Warriors.

356
00:16:19,125 --> 00:16:20,625
I don't want to let them down.

357
00:16:20,708 --> 00:16:22,083
[YAMABUSHI]
I understand your sentiment.

358
00:16:22,166 --> 00:16:23,833
I feel the same.

359
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:27,416
Now, ride upon my back and
we may continue our journey!

360
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,166
[HAKATA yelping]

361
00:16:30,541 --> 00:16:33,416
I know I'm not heavy, but I
feel bad having you carry me.

362
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,125
[YAMABUSHI]
Ka ka ka!

363
00:16:35,208 --> 00:16:38,208
No matter the hardship,
I shall greet it with a smile.

364
00:16:38,291 --> 00:16:41,500
This is the way that I have
chosen to honor our master.

365
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:43,916
It might serve you well
to do the same.

366
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,333
So let's see a smile
on your face, Hakata!

367
00:16:47,416 --> 00:16:49,083
You must strive
to gain the strength

368
00:16:49,166 --> 00:16:51,750
to laugh away every challenge!

369
00:16:51,833 --> 00:16:53,708
Ka ka ka ka!

370
00:16:53,791 --> 00:16:55,166
Onward!

371
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:57,333
Ka ka ka!

372
00:16:57,416 --> 00:16:59,083
[YASUSADA] We only have
so much time here.

373
00:16:59,166 --> 00:17:01,291
Are you sure we'll be okay?

374
00:17:01,375 --> 00:17:03,708
Come on. Stupid tree,
where are you?

375
00:17:04,958 --> 00:17:06,125
Don't stop like that!

376
00:17:06,208 --> 00:17:07,208
[MUTSUNOKAMI]
Shh!

377
00:17:13,125 --> 00:17:14,500
[MUTSUNOKAMI]
Yamatonokami, wait.

378
00:17:14,583 --> 00:17:15,458
Stay behind me.

379
00:17:15,541 --> 00:17:17,083
Keep your sword in its sheath.

380
00:17:18,958 --> 00:17:20,083
[MUTSUNOKAMI]
Are you listening?

381
00:17:20,166 --> 00:17:22,125
Better to finish it
before it finishes us.

382
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:24,208
[MUTSUNOKAMI]
Compose yourself.

383
00:17:24,291 --> 00:17:26,416
[YASUSADA]
Why don't you just shoot it?

384
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:27,833
[MUTSUNOKAMI]
I only have a few bullets.

385
00:17:27,916 --> 00:17:29,416
It wouldn't stop it in time.

386
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:31,625
Besides, we just want
to pass through.

387
00:17:31,708 --> 00:17:33,250
There's no need
to kill the thing.

388
00:17:34,416 --> 00:17:35,833
[YASUSADA gasps]

389
00:17:35,916 --> 00:17:37,375
[MUTSUNOKAMI]
I'll ask you one more time--

390
00:17:37,458 --> 00:17:40,125
please put your sword away.

391
00:17:40,208 --> 00:17:43,291
Noble bear, I beg that
you let us pass.

392
00:17:43,375 --> 00:17:46,083
Our master has been beset
with illness, you see.

393
00:17:46,166 --> 00:17:48,583
And we owe this
master a great debt.

394
00:17:48,666 --> 00:17:51,375
Without them, we wouldn't
even have a body.

395
00:17:51,458 --> 00:17:53,666
We would do anything
to save their life.

396
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:56,083
Not only because we are
loyal to their cause,

397
00:17:56,166 --> 00:17:58,375
but because we love them dearly.

398
00:17:58,458 --> 00:17:59,750
We don't want to fight.

399
00:17:59,833 --> 00:18:02,208
We only want to search
for medicine in the forest.

400
00:18:02,291 --> 00:18:04,500
So please...

401
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:06,000
You need not bare your fangs.

402
00:18:06,083 --> 00:18:07,791
We only want to pass.

403
00:18:07,875 --> 00:18:09,541
Our hearts are the same.

404
00:18:11,166 --> 00:18:14,833
[MUTSUNOKAMI] Surely we can
walk this earth together.

405
00:18:18,041 --> 00:18:19,750
I mean you no harm.

406
00:18:35,541 --> 00:18:37,333
[MUTSUNOKAMI] Sakamoto
Ryouma guided the Satsuma

407
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:39,625
and Choushuu clans
to a reconciliation,

408
00:18:39,708 --> 00:18:42,125
when before they got along
like cats and dogs.

409
00:18:42,208 --> 00:18:44,458
You can win without
swords or guns.

410
00:18:44,541 --> 00:18:46,791
all that you have to do
is open up your heart.

411
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:48,666
My old master's
wisdom came in handy,

412
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:51,166
even at a time like this.

413
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:53,458
Anyway, we'd
better get moving.

414
00:18:53,541 --> 00:18:54,500
[YASUSADA]
Right.

415
00:18:58,666 --> 00:19:00,958
This is the final stretch--
you still holding up?

416
00:19:01,041 --> 00:19:02,083
[YASUSADA]
Of course!

417
00:19:05,791 --> 00:19:08,041
Here I thought we
wouldn't make it on time.

418
00:19:08,125 --> 00:19:09,166
[KASHUU]
Hey!

419
00:19:10,333 --> 00:19:11,625
You didn't get lost after all.

420
00:19:11,708 --> 00:19:13,041
[HAKATA]
We did it!

421
00:19:13,125 --> 00:19:14,833
Now we just need to
make our way back!

422
00:19:14,916 --> 00:19:15,791
[grunts]

423
00:19:15,875 --> 00:19:17,291
Does your foot hurt?

424
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:19,625
I'm finally doing
something for the master!

425
00:19:19,708 --> 00:19:21,458
A little bruise won't stop me!

426
00:19:21,541 --> 00:19:24,833
Also, I bet I can make a killing
selling this weird fruit!

427
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,125
[KASHUU]
Yagen!

428
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:38,125
We got the thing
that you asked for!

429
00:19:38,208 --> 00:19:40,250
Hmm... Let me see here.

430
00:19:40,333 --> 00:19:41,291
Well...?

431
00:19:42,625 --> 00:19:44,708
Looks great, and you
gathered a whole lot, too!

432
00:19:44,791 --> 00:19:46,750
Will the medicine
take long to make?

433
00:19:46,833 --> 00:19:47,833
[YAGEN]
Not at all.

434
00:19:47,916 --> 00:19:48,833
We did it!

435
00:19:48,916 --> 00:19:49,916
[KASHUU]
Of course.

436
00:19:51,625 --> 00:19:54,000
I finished the purification.
I hope it helps.

437
00:19:54,083 --> 00:19:55,000
I'm sure it will.

438
00:19:55,083 --> 00:19:56,416
Thank you for everything.

439
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:57,583
You don't need to thank me;

440
00:19:57,666 --> 00:20:00,208
we all help the master
in any way we can.

441
00:20:00,291 --> 00:20:02,125
Like with that udon
you have there.

442
00:20:02,208 --> 00:20:03,833
[HASEBE]
Well, I gave it my best.

443
00:20:03,916 --> 00:20:05,041
We'll see how it goes.

444
00:20:06,041 --> 00:20:07,208
Excuse me, Master,

445
00:20:07,291 --> 00:20:08,708
your humble attendant
has brought you udon,

446
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:10,416
made with love and care.

447
00:20:11,458 --> 00:20:13,083
I hope it's to your liking.

448
00:20:13,166 --> 00:20:14,541
What, it's still too hot?

449
00:20:14,625 --> 00:20:15,666
My apologies.

450
00:20:19,166 --> 00:20:20,666
[MAEDA]
Uh, hey.

451
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:23,000
I wrote a letter
for the master.

452
00:20:23,083 --> 00:20:25,333
Do you think it would be
okay if I brought it up?

453
00:20:25,416 --> 00:20:28,166
Yeah, sure,
bet they'd love that.

454
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:29,208
Great!

455
00:20:31,916 --> 00:20:35,125
[HASEBE] Everyone,
the master ate the udon!

456
00:20:35,208 --> 00:20:36,750
I gave the master
Yagen's medicine

457
00:20:36,833 --> 00:20:38,958
and they seemed happy enough,
so that's a start.

458
00:20:39,041 --> 00:20:40,833
Now we wait.

459
00:20:40,916 --> 00:20:41,916
Okay.

460
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,541
[HASEBE]
They said it was so-so!

461
00:20:43,625 --> 00:20:46,250
After all, we are still swords.

462
00:20:46,333 --> 00:20:49,541
We can't serve our purpose
if our master is ill.

463
00:20:49,625 --> 00:20:52,708
Our greatest joy is
to be put to good use.

464
00:20:52,791 --> 00:20:55,125
That's why everyone
is fighting their hardest.

465
00:20:55,208 --> 00:20:56,250
[YASUSADA]
You're right.

466
00:21:09,791 --> 00:21:11,041
[YASUSADA]
Our master...

467
00:21:13,375 --> 00:21:14,500
...just like Souji.

468
00:21:14,583 --> 00:21:15,625
[KASHUU]
You okay?

469
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:19,208
What's the deal?

470
00:21:19,291 --> 00:21:21,250
It's just like you said!

471
00:21:21,333 --> 00:21:23,875
We have to fight our hardest
and grow even stronger!

472
00:21:23,958 --> 00:21:26,166
I want the master to
know how much I care!

473
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:28,791
[HASEBE] Yamatonokami,
the master is still sick.

474
00:21:28,875 --> 00:21:30,500
Whatever you want
to say can wait.

475
00:21:30,583 --> 00:21:32,333
No! No, it can't!

476
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:35,083
What has gotten into you?

477
00:21:35,166 --> 00:21:37,833
You're only going
to make matters worse!

478
00:21:37,916 --> 00:21:39,208
Idiot.

479
00:21:39,291 --> 00:21:41,041
[HASEBE] If you have a
message, I'll pass it along!

480
00:21:45,833 --> 00:21:46,833
Swimsuits?

481
00:21:46,916 --> 00:21:48,458
And a loincloth.

482
00:21:48,541 --> 00:21:51,083
Ah! I wanted to go to
the beach with everyone,

483
00:21:51,166 --> 00:21:52,541
so I requested these.

484
00:21:52,625 --> 00:21:54,916
Looks like the master
was cool with it after all!

485
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,083
[KASHUU] Wait, they made
all of these by hand?

486
00:21:57,166 --> 00:21:58,041
Couldn't we buy them?

487
00:21:58,125 --> 00:21:59,916
[HASEBE]
No, because we're poor.

488
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,958
And do you know why that is?

489
00:22:02,041 --> 00:22:03,500
Because you all
used up the allowance

490
00:22:03,583 --> 00:22:05,458
buying crap at
the general store!

491
00:22:05,541 --> 00:22:06,958
That's no good.

492
00:22:07,041 --> 00:22:08,958
I didn't realize I was causing
the master so much stress

493
00:22:09,041 --> 00:22:11,458
over some silly vacation.

494
00:22:11,541 --> 00:22:12,833
[YASUSADA]
Handmade, huh?

495
00:22:12,916 --> 00:22:14,541
[HASEBE] Yeah, and they
said it was their first time

496
00:22:14,625 --> 00:22:15,833
sewing clothes, no less.

497
00:22:15,916 --> 00:22:17,791
[SHOKUDAIKIRI]
We all care for the master.

498
00:22:17,875 --> 00:22:19,833
And they care for us.

499
00:22:19,916 --> 00:22:22,291
This citadel truly is blessed.

500
00:22:22,375 --> 00:22:24,291
We'll return the favor somehow!

501
00:22:24,375 --> 00:22:25,458
Of course we will.

502
00:22:25,541 --> 00:22:27,208
[KASHUU]
We have bigger issues here.

503
00:22:27,291 --> 00:22:28,625
Like this loincloth.

504
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,333
Who's gonna wear it?
