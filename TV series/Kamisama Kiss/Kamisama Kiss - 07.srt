1
00:01:38,125 --> 00:01:40,458
That hot guy who's friends with
Nanami showed up again!

2
00:01:40,541 --> 00:01:41,000
Pinch me.

3
00:01:41,083 --> 00:01:42,333
Right Now!

4
00:01:44,166 --> 00:01:46,000
He stands out without
even doing anything.

5
00:01:46,083 --> 00:01:48,041
How am I supposed
to deal with that?

6
00:01:53,708 --> 00:01:54,958
This isn't good.

7
00:01:55,041 --> 00:01:56,958
All of my land god stuff
is keeping me so busy that

8
00:01:57,041 --> 00:02:00,208
I've barely been able to keep up
with any of this material.

9
00:02:00,291 --> 00:02:03,125
Ujigami High School is
nearing the end of a term.

10
00:02:03,208 --> 00:02:06,416
And the end of a term
brings none other than.

11
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:07,875
Stupid finals.

12
00:02:07,958 --> 00:02:10,125
They're almost as gross
as these mushrooms.

13
00:02:11,166 --> 00:02:12,750
I told you to quit
packing those for lunch;

14
00:02:12,833 --> 00:02:14,000
you know I hate mushrooms!

15
00:02:14,083 --> 00:02:15,666
Why don't you listen for once?

16
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:17,583
What was that?

17
00:02:17,666 --> 00:02:19,541
You are more than
just a poor goddess.

18
00:02:19,625 --> 00:02:20,916
From the sounds of it,

19
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,916
you are an equally poor student
unable to keep pace.

20
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,083
How heartbreaking.

21
00:02:24,166 --> 00:02:26,166
I would recommend
dropping out at once.

22
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:28,541
Save yourself the
utter embarrassment.

23
00:02:36,958 --> 00:02:39,083
Tomoe started coming
to school to protect me,

24
00:02:39,166 --> 00:02:42,125
which made sense
at the time, but now.

25
00:02:42,208 --> 00:02:43,958
What is keeping you so busy?

26
00:02:44,041 --> 00:02:47,000
You have barely done anything
as the new land god.

27
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:48,791
It's a work in progress.

28
00:02:48,875 --> 00:02:50,291
He wants me to act like a god.

29
00:02:50,375 --> 00:02:52,583
But the things I can
do aren't very useful.

30
00:02:54,791 --> 00:02:56,208
What's up, fox?

31
00:02:59,208 --> 00:03:01,166
Tagging along
with Nanami again?

32
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:03,000
Make sure you study hard.

33
00:03:03,083 --> 00:03:04,208
What about you?

34
00:03:04,291 --> 00:03:06,750
Still shepherding a flock
of naïve sheep?

35
00:03:06,833 --> 00:03:10,000
I'm surprised Nanami does
not absolutely hate you yet.

36
00:03:10,083 --> 00:03:12,375
But she's bound
to come around soon.

37
00:03:12,458 --> 00:03:13,708
Yes, well.

38
00:03:13,791 --> 00:03:15,708
Coming from a person she
already hates, your words

39
00:03:15,791 --> 00:03:17,750
may carry a certain weight.

40
00:03:17,833 --> 00:03:19,458
She doesn't hate me.

41
00:03:19,541 --> 00:03:20,875
How sad it must be,

42
00:03:20,958 --> 00:03:22,916
to not realize what an annoying
bastard you really are!

43
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,291
I guess it takes one
to know one.

44
00:03:25,375 --> 00:03:26,833
Seriously.

45
00:03:26,916 --> 00:03:29,666
You'd think two yokai would
at least be able to get along.

46
00:03:36,583 --> 00:03:38,208
Is something the matter?

47
00:03:40,083 --> 00:03:40,500
Nope.

48
00:03:40,583 --> 00:03:41,833
Hey, Nanami!

49
00:03:45,083 --> 00:03:47,375
I haven't been able to thank
Kurama for his help yet since

50
00:03:47,458 --> 00:03:49,666
he's always surrounded by girls.

51
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:50,916
And today.

52
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,208
I thought I'd finally
worked up enough courage

53
00:03:52,291 --> 00:03:54,625
to thank him
but here I am again.

54
00:03:55,708 --> 00:03:58,083
I don't think
he remembers me at all.

55
00:03:58,166 --> 00:04:00,500
So maybe I just
won't say anything.

56
00:04:00,583 --> 00:04:02,000
Poor girl.

57
00:04:02,083 --> 00:04:04,791
She is so freaking adorable!

58
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:07,625
Don't worry,

59
00:04:07,708 --> 00:04:10,958
I'll get Kurama to meet with
you so you guys can chat.

60
00:04:11,041 --> 00:04:12,208
So Ami.

61
00:04:12,291 --> 00:04:14,166
I'm guessing you want
to talk to him alone.

62
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:15,875
Am I right?

63
00:04:17,333 --> 00:04:20,291
I've been meaning to ask you
this for awhile now.

64
00:04:20,375 --> 00:04:23,416
Do you have weird supernatural
powers or something?

65
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:25,000
Supernatural?

66
00:04:25,083 --> 00:04:28,041
You did that Ghost busting in
the locker room the other day.

67
00:04:28,125 --> 00:04:29,583
Is that so.

68
00:04:29,666 --> 00:04:31,000
I swear I haven't told anyone!

69
00:04:31,083 --> 00:04:32,083
Not a single person!

70
00:04:32,166 --> 00:04:33,291
Please believe me!

71
00:04:34,666 --> 00:04:37,250
We cannot blame dear Nanami
for being clueless.

72
00:04:37,333 --> 00:04:40,333
It is a stunt Tomoe pulled the
other day when he went to school

73
00:04:40,416 --> 00:04:43,000
masquerading for
a sickly Nanami.

74
00:04:46,333 --> 00:04:47,500
I dunno.

75
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,500
I don't think that
I'm anything special.

76
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,458
But I guess you never know, huh?

77
00:04:54,625 --> 00:04:57,333
I think I've just
found my next task.

78
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:01,625
Oh my.

79
00:05:01,708 --> 00:05:06,000
As a personal rule, I never
accept gifts from my fans.

80
00:05:06,083 --> 00:05:07,208
Sorry, ladies.

81
00:05:07,291 --> 00:05:09,166
He apologized to us,
I think I'm gonna faint!

82
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:10,708
Keep buying my albums,
that's gift enough.

83
00:05:10,791 --> 00:05:11,541
Kurama!

84
00:05:11,625 --> 00:05:12,916
Hold still Please!

85
00:05:20,333 --> 00:05:23,125
Hey, is it just me or did
she go kind of overboard

86
00:05:23,208 --> 00:05:24,708
with our math final?

87
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:27,166
We've got English the same day,
which definitely doesn't help.

88
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:28,416
The night before each of them,

89
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:31,208
maybe we should all
get together and study.

90
00:05:31,291 --> 00:05:32,458
How strange.

91
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:34,625
It's like I just up and
vanished into thin air.

92
00:05:34,708 --> 00:05:35,708
Would you mind leaving that

93
00:05:35,791 --> 00:05:37,375
on your back for a
little bit longer?

94
00:05:37,458 --> 00:05:39,000
Also, Um.

95
00:05:39,083 --> 00:05:41,625
Could you maybe
do me a huge favor?

96
00:05:43,666 --> 00:05:46,250
Go stand outside
the chemistry room.

97
00:05:46,333 --> 00:05:48,666
Someone wants to meet with you,
so wait for her there.

98
00:05:50,291 --> 00:05:51,791
Are you kidding me?!

99
00:05:51,875 --> 00:05:54,625
Not a single person is
fawning over my presence?!

100
00:05:54,708 --> 00:05:56,750
This superstar's presence?!

101
00:05:57,833 --> 00:05:59,666
What a pity.

102
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:01,500
Kurama!

103
00:06:01,583 --> 00:06:03,791
I'm so sorry I'm late, my
teacher wanted me to help her

104
00:06:03,875 --> 00:06:06,041
after class and
I couldn't get out of it!

105
00:06:06,958 --> 00:06:08,041
Seriously?

106
00:06:09,375 --> 00:06:10,958
 Here!

107
00:06:12,958 --> 00:06:14,041
The other day.

108
00:06:16,291 --> 00:06:17,791
Thank you for helping me.

109
00:06:17,875 --> 00:06:19,791
I never got the
chance to thank you.

110
00:06:19,875 --> 00:06:21,291
So yeah.

111
00:06:21,375 --> 00:06:23,916
Thanks for that and for taking
the time to meet me here.

112
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,083
Hmm.

113
00:06:26,166 --> 00:06:26,791
Sorry.

114
00:06:26,875 --> 00:06:28,416
Who are you again?

115
00:06:29,666 --> 00:06:30,208
Sorry.

116
00:06:30,291 --> 00:06:32,166
Who are you again?

117
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:34,416
I'm a much bigger fan of
the romantic comedy genre.

118
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:35,875
 Nobody!

119
00:06:40,958 --> 00:06:42,291
Owwie.

120
00:06:42,375 --> 00:06:45,125
Dude, we totally just
witnessed an epic panty shot!

121
00:06:45,208 --> 00:06:45,750
Wha?

122
00:06:45,833 --> 00:06:47,291
Isobe?!

123
00:06:47,375 --> 00:06:49,541
You wear strawberry panties
just like a little kid would!

124
00:06:49,625 --> 00:06:50,791
How old are you?!

125
00:06:52,833 --> 00:06:54,541
Strawberry panties!

126
00:06:54,625 --> 00:06:56,166
Starting today I'm
gonna be calling you

127
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:58,041
Strawberry Panties Nekota!

128
00:06:58,125 --> 00:07:00,500
Please stop it!

129
00:07:00,583 --> 00:07:02,291
Cut it out.

130
00:07:02,375 --> 00:07:05,583
So you two morons finally
saw a girl's underwear.

131
00:07:05,666 --> 00:07:06,958
Big deal.

132
00:07:08,541 --> 00:07:09,750
 Kurama looks mad.

133
00:07:09,833 --> 00:07:11,333
Oh, hey.

134
00:07:11,416 --> 00:07:12,791
Gotta run!

135
00:07:15,083 --> 00:07:17,291
Miss Nekota, correct?

136
00:07:17,375 --> 00:07:18,625
Yeah.

137
00:07:21,791 --> 00:07:23,666
May I ask for your first name?

138
00:07:27,958 --> 00:07:29,166
 It's Ami.

139
00:07:34,833 --> 00:07:36,208
Thank goodness.

140
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:41,375
Looks like Ami finally got
to tell Kurama thank you.

141
00:07:41,458 --> 00:07:42,750
Wouldn't you say
my divine powers are

142
00:07:42,833 --> 00:07:45,125
working out pretty well?

143
00:07:45,208 --> 00:07:46,458
You know.

144
00:07:46,541 --> 00:07:48,125
I might be getting the
hang of this god business!

145
00:07:48,208 --> 00:07:49,250
You fool.

146
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:52,583
You thoughtlessly take on
random favors without regard

147
00:07:52,666 --> 00:07:54,083
to the consequences.

148
00:07:54,166 --> 00:07:57,000
Why even bother getting
that naïve girl's hopes up?

149
00:07:58,333 --> 00:08:00,208
Kurama is a yokai.

150
00:08:00,291 --> 00:08:02,375
If that girl finds out
the object of her affection

151
00:08:02,458 --> 00:08:03,875
is not even human.

152
00:08:03,958 --> 00:08:06,833
I doubt she would be ecstatic.

153
00:08:06,916 --> 00:08:10,166
How do you know,
she might be okay with it.

154
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:12,250
Why is Tomoe always so
negative when it comes

155
00:08:12,333 --> 00:08:14,875
to this kind of stuff?

156
00:08:14,958 --> 00:08:16,458
I wonder.

157
00:08:16,541 --> 00:08:19,958
Maybe he was rejected and hurt
by someone he loved in his past!

158
00:08:20,916 --> 00:08:22,416
 Keep studying!

159
00:08:26,208 --> 00:08:28,291
Tomoe may be unhappy about it.

160
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:31,083
But I made someone's
day a little brighter.

161
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:35,958
Is that really such
a terrible thing to do?

162
00:08:36,041 --> 00:08:37,291
What's wrong?

163
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:38,791
Nothing.

164
00:08:38,875 --> 00:08:40,166
I just think it would be better
for both humans and yokai

165
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:42,250
to get along with
each other, that's all.

166
00:08:42,333 --> 00:08:45,041
What purpose does
befriending one another serve?

167
00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:46,416
There could be some
humans out there that

168
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,208
you'd hit it off
with really well.

169
00:08:48,291 --> 00:08:50,916
You should try getting to know
one, you might be surprised!

170
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,166
 There is no point.

171
00:08:53,625 --> 00:08:56,291
Being able to protect you
is all that I care about.

172
00:09:00,458 --> 00:09:01,708
 Come on.

173
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:04,625
You shouldn't say things
like that so casually.

174
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:11,125
Excuse me, are you Nanami?

175
00:09:11,208 --> 00:09:14,125
If you're not too busy could
we ask you some questions?

176
00:09:14,208 --> 00:09:15,708
About what?

177
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:19,750
 My name's Yumi Sakurada.

178
00:09:19,833 --> 00:09:21,166
I'm a freshman.

179
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:24,041
I have a crush on Tomoe
but I've never talked to him.

180
00:09:24,125 --> 00:09:26,791
Seriously, there's like
no opportunities like ever.

181
00:09:26,875 --> 00:09:29,083
And it's like you guys
are always together.

182
00:09:29,166 --> 00:09:30,833
You're literally always
with him or he's with you

183
00:09:30,916 --> 00:09:32,916
and it drives me crazy!

184
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,875
In other words, are you and
Tomoe in a serious relationship?

185
00:09:35,958 --> 00:09:38,333
Come on, give her
a straight answer.

186
00:09:38,416 --> 00:09:39,333
 Well.

187
00:09:39,416 --> 00:09:40,750
I think this might
surprise you,

188
00:09:40,833 --> 00:09:43,125
but we're not together
or anything like that.

189
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:44,083
Are you for reelz?!

190
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:46,541
Be honest, don't you lie to me!

191
00:09:46,625 --> 00:09:48,458
For reelz.

192
00:09:48,541 --> 00:09:50,291
It's a miracle!

193
00:09:50,375 --> 00:09:52,958
Is it okay if I ask you
for a teensy favor?

194
00:09:54,708 --> 00:09:56,958
You're always walking home
with Tomoe, right?

195
00:09:57,041 --> 00:09:59,916
Do you mind if I walk home
with him, just for today?

196
00:10:05,166 --> 00:10:06,166
Go ahead.

197
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:08,458
Thank you so much!

198
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:13,500
It's not that big a deal.

199
00:10:15,291 --> 00:10:17,791
This won't require any powers.

200
00:10:17,875 --> 00:10:20,583
I just have to make up
an excuse.

201
00:10:20,666 --> 00:10:22,666
Then I'll start heading
home without him.

202
00:10:27,583 --> 00:10:29,375
Excuse me, Tomoe?

203
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:36,166
Will you be walking home
all by yourself today?

204
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:37,291
Why don't we walk together?

205
00:10:37,375 --> 00:10:38,375
No.

206
00:10:38,458 --> 00:10:40,041
I have commitments

207
00:10:44,291 --> 00:10:46,375
The Dutch Declaration
of Independence.

208
00:10:46,458 --> 00:10:48,916
1581.

209
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,541
The Edict of Nantes.

210
00:10:50,625 --> 00:10:52,291
1598.

211
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:00,541
I wonder if Tomoe ended up
walking home with that girl?

212
00:11:02,208 --> 00:11:05,708
You should try getting to know
one, you might be surprised.

213
00:11:05,791 --> 00:11:06,875
I wish.

214
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:12,375
I wish I'd never said that.

215
00:11:12,458 --> 00:11:14,500
Can I walk home with him today?

216
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:22,333
I'm so dumb.

217
00:11:22,416 --> 00:11:25,125
I accepted her request on
the spot and now here I am,

218
00:11:25,208 --> 00:11:26,416
regretting it.

219
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:28,833
This really sucks.

220
00:11:28,916 --> 00:11:31,458
If I knew it was going
to bother me this much.

221
00:11:31,541 --> 00:11:33,250
I wouldn't have said yes.

222
00:11:33,333 --> 00:11:34,333
I can't help it.

223
00:11:34,416 --> 00:11:36,750
I have a crush on Tomoe!

224
00:11:36,833 --> 00:11:38,916
I like him too.

225
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,166
Me, too?

226
00:11:45,625 --> 00:11:46,833
Me, too.

227
00:11:48,083 --> 00:11:50,375
What is the meaning
of this nonsense?!

228
00:11:50,458 --> 00:11:53,666
You wanted me to become friendly
with a human girl, is that it?

229
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:54,750
So, you heard that?

230
00:11:54,833 --> 00:11:56,416
Of course I heard.

231
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:57,750
Do you honestly think
matching a human

232
00:11:57,833 --> 00:11:59,833
with a yokai is considerate?

233
00:11:59,916 --> 00:12:01,875
You really are a simpleton.

234
00:12:01,958 --> 00:12:03,291
Do not set things
in motion out

235
00:12:03,375 --> 00:12:06,625
of the so-called
kindness of your heart.

236
00:12:06,708 --> 00:12:08,666
In my eyes, there is
nothing in this world

237
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:10,916
that takes greater
priority over you.

238
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,666
I mean that.

239
00:12:18,916 --> 00:12:21,666
With those words,
I finally knew.

240
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:24,666
I knew exactly how
Tomoe made me feel.

241
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,666
I had fallen so hard for him.

242
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:33,291
That I never even realized it.

243
00:12:42,291 --> 00:12:43,333
Well?

244
00:12:43,416 --> 00:12:44,583
What is so important

245
00:12:44,666 --> 00:12:46,833
that I had to drag
myself to this foul place?

246
00:12:46,916 --> 00:12:48,083
It's simple.

247
00:12:48,166 --> 00:12:50,291
I overheard your rooftop
conversation with Nanami

248
00:12:50,375 --> 00:12:52,333
and got rather
worried about you.

249
00:12:52,416 --> 00:12:54,500
Being wise to the ways
of the human world,

250
00:12:54,583 --> 00:12:57,666
I thought I'd give my foolish
friend a fair warning.

251
00:12:57,750 --> 00:13:00,166
What conversation do you mean?

252
00:13:01,291 --> 00:13:02,833
There's no one in this
great big world that means

253
00:13:02,916 --> 00:13:04,500
more to me than you, Nanami!

254
00:13:04,583 --> 00:13:06,291
You're the only thing
that's important!

255
00:13:06,375 --> 00:13:08,458
I believe it was something
along those lines.

256
00:13:08,541 --> 00:13:10,041
I never said
anything of the sort.

257
00:13:10,125 --> 00:13:11,791
You can't be serious.

258
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:13,875
You're even more hopeless
than I thought.

259
00:13:13,958 --> 00:13:15,291
Nanami's at that age

260
00:13:15,375 --> 00:13:17,625
where human girls start dating
and looking for a mate.

261
00:13:17,708 --> 00:13:19,458
As her familiar, do you
really want to be the object

262
00:13:19,541 --> 00:13:20,958
of her affection?

263
00:13:21,041 --> 00:13:23,625
The land god of Mikage Shrine?

264
00:13:23,708 --> 00:13:26,041
Be sure to start practicing
a little more discretion

265
00:13:26,125 --> 00:13:27,208
when you handle the girl.

266
00:13:27,291 --> 00:13:29,000
After all, she is your
lady and mistress.

267
00:13:29,083 --> 00:13:30,333
We wouldn't want things
to get too dicey

268
00:13:30,416 --> 00:13:31,791
between the two of you.

269
00:13:31,875 --> 00:13:34,916
Are you implying that
Nanami is being seduced?

270
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,833
Being a familiar
sounds pretty rough.

271
00:13:37,916 --> 00:13:39,041
Babysitting.

272
00:13:39,125 --> 00:13:42,083
That's all the
fearsome fox does now.

273
00:13:42,166 --> 00:13:43,416
It would all be so much easier

274
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:45,041
if you'd just hurry up
and make me the land god.

275
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:47,041
What nonsense!

276
00:13:47,125 --> 00:13:48,500
There is only one being in

277
00:13:48,583 --> 00:13:51,083
the entire world who holds
the power to give me orders.

278
00:13:51,166 --> 00:13:53,291
Yet you would dare say she
is like any other schoolgirl

279
00:13:53,375 --> 00:13:55,750
that loses her head
over petty emotions?

280
00:13:57,125 --> 00:13:58,833
Do not take me for a fool.

281
00:13:58,916 --> 00:14:01,083
Whatever you say.

282
00:14:01,166 --> 00:14:02,333
Time to go.

283
00:14:07,166 --> 00:14:09,041
Why won't it open?

284
00:14:09,125 --> 00:14:10,291
Let me try.

285
00:14:11,625 --> 00:14:13,125
Pardon us.

286
00:14:13,208 --> 00:14:14,916
When I become land god,
the first order I'll give

287
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,833
my familiar will be
to kill himself.

288
00:14:16,916 --> 00:14:20,291
Well, you certainly set some
lofty goals for yourself!

289
00:14:20,375 --> 00:14:21,625
What?!

290
00:14:27,791 --> 00:14:30,333
I am so glad finals are over.

291
00:14:30,416 --> 00:14:32,250
Ugh, that was rough.

292
00:14:32,333 --> 00:14:34,875
Hey, where did
Tomoe run off to?

293
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:36,666
I think he had mentioned
something about picking up

294
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:38,625
a few things with Kurama today.

295
00:14:38,708 --> 00:14:40,125
Really.

296
00:14:40,208 --> 00:14:42,916
In that case, why don't we
celebrate finishing up finals?

297
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,166
Do either of you wanna grab
a bite to eat somewhere?

298
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:46,916
I could really go
for some donut holes!

299
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:47,750
What do you say?

300
00:14:47,833 --> 00:14:48,625
Count me out.

301
00:14:48,708 --> 00:14:51,125
I've got a date with my new BF.

302
00:14:51,208 --> 00:14:52,916
You're replacing us with a boy?!

303
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,416
Uh, yeah, guys come
first in my book.

304
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,291
A boyfriend, huh?

305
00:14:57,375 --> 00:14:58,875
That must be nice.

306
00:15:00,625 --> 00:15:01,833
What are you talking about?

307
00:15:01,916 --> 00:15:04,875
I could've sworn you
were going out with Tomoe.

308
00:15:04,958 --> 00:15:07,541
You're always together,
so it made sense to me.

309
00:15:07,625 --> 00:15:10,250
We do spend time together,
but we can't help that.

310
00:15:10,333 --> 00:15:12,958
Our problem is that we're
too close to begin with.

311
00:15:13,041 --> 00:15:15,458
Yeah, he kinda told me
I mean a lot to him.

312
00:15:15,541 --> 00:15:17,958
But it wasn't like "mean a lot"
like that, you know.

313
00:15:18,041 --> 00:15:19,291
We live together and stuff,

314
00:15:19,375 --> 00:15:20,708
but it's not like we've
ever been out on a date

315
00:15:20,791 --> 00:15:23,375
or anything fun.

316
00:15:23,458 --> 00:15:24,583
She's bragging, right?

317
00:15:24,666 --> 00:15:25,208
No!

318
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:26,750
Of course I'm not!

319
00:15:26,833 --> 00:15:29,250
If the two of you still aren't
as close as you want to be,

320
00:15:29,333 --> 00:15:31,333
Why not try switching
things up on him now and then?

321
00:15:31,416 --> 00:15:33,291
But, how would I do that?

322
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:36,166
If you've never been out on a
date, then go out on a date.

323
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:37,791
Simple as that.

324
00:15:37,875 --> 00:15:40,791
Drag him to a place he's never
been before and act all cute,

325
00:15:40,875 --> 00:15:42,666
like super cute.

326
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:44,416
Super cute?

327
00:15:46,166 --> 00:15:47,958
Hello; guys adore adorable.

328
00:15:48,041 --> 00:15:50,500
So win him over with cuteness,
and he'll want more.

329
00:15:53,083 --> 00:15:54,208
Oh Em Gee!

330
00:15:54,291 --> 00:15:55,958
Nanami has a crush on Tomoe!

331
00:15:56,041 --> 00:15:57,333
I didn't know, but I love it!

332
00:15:57,416 --> 00:16:00,708
Oh, hey Ami welcome
to the conversation.

333
00:16:00,791 --> 00:16:02,500
A place he's never been before?

334
00:16:02,583 --> 00:16:04,333
Nanami.

335
00:16:04,416 --> 00:16:05,875
 Time to go home.

336
00:16:07,291 --> 00:16:08,666
Right.

337
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,625
Tomoe's always in such
a hurry to get home.

338
00:16:13,708 --> 00:16:15,166
I know he's worried
about taking care

339
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:17,875
of the shrine and
everything, but still.

340
00:16:19,125 --> 00:16:20,500
Hey Tomoe.

341
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:23,000
Since school
got out early today,

342
00:16:23,083 --> 00:16:25,791
let's not rush
back home so fast.

343
00:16:25,875 --> 00:16:28,250
Right now's the perfect
time for an adventure.

344
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:31,833
Wooow.

345
00:16:31,916 --> 00:16:33,125
The aquarium!

346
00:16:33,208 --> 00:16:36,541
I haven't been here
since elementary school!

347
00:16:36,625 --> 00:16:38,916
I can't believe they're still
playing my favorite show,

348
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,750
and it's starting in less
than five minutes!

349
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:42,041
Let's go now!

350
00:16:42,125 --> 00:16:43,750
Okay, what are you
trying to pull?!

351
00:16:43,833 --> 00:16:47,250
Exams are over, so it's
time for us to relax!

352
00:16:47,333 --> 00:16:49,750
We're already here so we
might as well enjoy it.

353
00:16:49,833 --> 00:16:50,833
Cool?!

354
00:16:54,333 --> 00:16:57,375
Wow, that one's gigantic!

355
00:16:57,458 --> 00:17:01,083
It's amazing the ocean's full
of so many different fish!

356
00:17:01,166 --> 00:17:02,625
What do you think, Tomoe?

357
00:17:02,708 --> 00:17:03,916
Hey.

358
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,708
Don't wander off without me!

359
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:06,958
I was following the route.

360
00:17:07,041 --> 00:17:08,541
Just look at the fish!

361
00:17:08,625 --> 00:17:10,791
Look at the fish!

362
00:17:13,708 --> 00:17:15,375
It's not working.

363
00:17:15,458 --> 00:17:18,125
He's looked miserable
the entire time.

364
00:17:19,833 --> 00:17:21,916
This day has been
a complete disaster!

365
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,041
I've got to do
something to fix it.

366
00:17:26,083 --> 00:17:27,708
Hey, what do you think
that crowd's checking out?

367
00:17:27,791 --> 00:17:29,083
Let's go see!

368
00:17:29,166 --> 00:17:31,583
I bet you've never seen
anything like it before!

369
00:17:34,416 --> 00:17:37,250
Look at all our new friends
who came here just to see you.

370
00:17:37,333 --> 00:17:38,958
Go ahead and introduce
yourself, Lionel!

371
00:17:39,041 --> 00:17:41,750
Why do people have
to be so tall?!

372
00:17:49,583 --> 00:17:51,416
Quit horsing around!

373
00:17:54,916 --> 00:17:56,666
Were you able to see?

374
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:58,500
Uh, yes.

375
00:17:58,583 --> 00:18:00,208
Good.

376
00:18:00,291 --> 00:18:01,791
Time to go home.

377
00:18:12,708 --> 00:18:13,875
Take my hand.

378
00:18:17,375 --> 00:18:19,208
Hello; guys adore adorable.

379
00:18:19,291 --> 00:18:22,083
So win him over with cuteness,
and he'll want more.

380
00:18:27,958 --> 00:18:29,458
Pinch me.

381
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:31,416
Someone pinch me.

382
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:34,208
Okay then, we just saw
the last fish in the aquarium.

383
00:18:34,291 --> 00:18:35,583
No doubt you are satisfied.

384
00:18:35,666 --> 00:18:38,375
What a happy ending
to this grand adventure!

385
00:18:38,458 --> 00:18:40,166
Now, let's go!

386
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:42,000
Hey, wait a sec!

387
00:18:42,083 --> 00:18:43,666
We've got to make
the most of this trip.

388
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:45,375
Look at all of the stars!

389
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:47,708
I wanna get a better
view before we leave.

390
00:18:47,791 --> 00:18:49,125
A little longer.

391
00:18:49,208 --> 00:18:51,041
Just a little while longer?

392
00:18:51,125 --> 00:18:53,500
Please don't let it end yet!

393
00:18:53,583 --> 00:18:55,250
Hurry up, will ya?!

394
00:18:59,041 --> 00:19:00,416
What an incredible view!

395
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:02,083
Too bad I didn't
bring my camera.

396
00:19:02,166 --> 00:19:05,375
Do you think we can see
the shrine from here?

397
00:19:05,458 --> 00:19:05,958
Well?

398
00:19:06,041 --> 00:19:07,416
Tomoe?

399
00:19:10,333 --> 00:19:11,916
What's wrong?

400
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,375
You have been acting
strangely today.

401
00:19:14,458 --> 00:19:17,125
You seem more excited and
more cheerful than usual.

402
00:19:17,958 --> 00:19:19,416
Surely the fish
and the night view

403
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,416
did not cause this
transformation.

404
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:22,125
No.

405
00:19:22,208 --> 00:19:23,458
You're overthinking it.

406
00:19:23,541 --> 00:19:25,583
There is one thing
I want to ask you.

407
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:31,000
Tell me, have you or have
you not been seduced by me?

408
00:19:35,125 --> 00:19:37,666
It was something
that Kurama mentioned.

409
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:39,750
Human girls your age
start becoming interested

410
00:19:39,833 --> 00:19:41,000
in finding love.

411
00:19:41,083 --> 00:19:43,500
He implied you
were no exception.

412
00:19:43,583 --> 00:19:45,083
He warned me I must not speak

413
00:19:45,166 --> 00:19:48,000
to you in a manner that might
cause you fall in love with me.

414
00:19:51,958 --> 00:19:53,958
Well, Kurama loves his
jokes and we must think

415
00:19:54,041 --> 00:19:54,791
nothing of them.

416
00:19:54,875 --> 00:19:56,833
What if it was true?

417
00:19:56,916 --> 00:19:59,166
What if I did like you?

418
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:03,041
And what would you say
if Kurama was right?

419
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:10,625
No.

420
00:20:10,708 --> 00:20:12,125
You are deluding yourself.

421
00:20:12,208 --> 00:20:12,708
No.

422
00:20:12,791 --> 00:20:14,041
No I'm not!

423
00:20:14,125 --> 00:20:15,041
No.

424
00:20:15,125 --> 00:20:17,416
What if what I'm
really feeling is.

425
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:18,208
Love.

426
00:20:18,291 --> 00:20:20,791
You fool.

427
00:20:20,875 --> 00:20:24,041
I will never allow myself
to love a human woman.

428
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:27,333
What are you doing?!

429
00:20:27,416 --> 00:20:28,750
We're going to fall!

430
00:20:28,833 --> 00:20:30,500
Let us hope the cool night
breeze can bring you back

431
00:20:30,583 --> 00:20:31,916
to your senses.

432
00:20:32,791 --> 00:20:35,083
Stop struggling;
this is for your own good.

433
00:20:35,166 --> 00:20:37,541
Admit that you were delusional
and I will let you down.

434
00:20:37,625 --> 00:20:39,375
I won't do it!

435
00:20:39,458 --> 00:20:41,583
Because I really do
have feelings for you!

436
00:20:41,666 --> 00:20:44,208
You told me yourself
that I was important to you!

437
00:20:44,291 --> 00:20:45,458
Never mind that!

438
00:20:45,541 --> 00:20:48,833
So you really never felt
the same way about me?

439
00:20:48,916 --> 00:20:50,916
And you never even once
found me attractive,

440
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,125
not even for a single moment?

441
00:21:07,208 --> 00:21:08,666
Nanami!

442
00:21:11,208 --> 00:21:12,916
I've been rejected.

443
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,375
Getting my hopes up like that.

444
00:21:15,458 --> 00:21:17,875
How was I so stupid?

445
00:21:17,958 --> 00:21:20,000
I can't look Tomoe
in the eye anymore.

446
00:21:20,083 --> 00:21:21,875
I just can't!

447
00:21:21,958 --> 00:21:23,500
Nanami!

448
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:25,333
Give me your hand!

449
00:21:25,416 --> 00:21:26,666
Do it now!

450
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:29,083
Tomoe.

451
00:21:29,166 --> 00:21:29,916
No!

452
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,541
Don't help me!

453
00:21:31,625 --> 00:21:32,958
What did you say to me?

454
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:35,416
Don't you touch me!

455
00:21:39,166 --> 00:21:40,375
The Sacred Word.

456
00:21:40,458 --> 00:21:41,416
You idiot.

457
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:42,958
Do you want to die?!

458
00:21:43,041 --> 00:21:46,833
If you never even liked me,
you can just stay away from me!

459
00:21:48,166 --> 00:21:49,208
Nanami.

460
00:21:49,291 --> 00:21:50,083
Nanami!

461
00:21:50,166 --> 00:21:51,708
Please!

462
00:21:51,791 --> 00:21:53,833
I promise you that I will
never touch you again,

463
00:21:53,916 --> 00:21:57,333
but please at this very moment,
you have to let me save you!

464
00:22:07,791 --> 00:22:11,708
He's so kind,
and strong, and warm.

465
00:22:17,083 --> 00:22:19,833
How could I ever
give up on him?

466
00:22:19,916 --> 00:22:21,625
It isn't fair.

467
00:22:21,708 --> 00:22:23,750
Time to return home.

468
00:22:29,166 --> 00:22:31,000
It's no use.

469
00:22:31,083 --> 00:22:35,208
I know that my love for him
will just keep growing.

470
00:23:46,041 --> 00:23:49,125
Nanami's declaration of
love ends in heartbreak.

471
00:23:49,208 --> 00:23:51,750
What better place to get over
rejection than at the beach?

472
00:23:51,833 --> 00:23:53,833
But a dark shadow
rises up from the sea,

473
00:23:53,916 --> 00:23:56,041
claiming unfinished
business with Tomoe.

474
00:23:56,125 --> 00:23:57,625
Who invited that guy?!

475
00:23:57,708 --> 00:23:59,708
Next time, "The God
Goes To The Beach".

476
00:23:59,791 --> 00:24:01,291
Don't forget your swimsuits!
