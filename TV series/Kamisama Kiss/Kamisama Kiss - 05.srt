1
00:01:38,541 --> 00:01:39,875
Nanami Momozono.

2
00:01:39,958 --> 00:01:42,291
High school student.

3
00:01:42,375 --> 00:01:44,333
This girl is hardly
more than a child.

4
00:01:44,416 --> 00:01:46,833
How did she become god
of the Mikage Shrine?

5
00:01:46,916 --> 00:01:48,500
Where has Mikage gone?

6
00:01:48,583 --> 00:01:51,833
His whereabouts have been
unknown for twenty years now.

7
00:01:51,916 --> 00:01:53,083
Unknown?

8
00:01:53,166 --> 00:01:55,041
Will you give me Tomoe, please?

9
00:01:56,125 --> 00:01:57,583
Um, I think no.

10
00:01:57,666 --> 00:01:59,041
He refuses to give me Tomoe,

11
00:01:59,125 --> 00:02:01,166
and then he disappears
for twenty years?

12
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:03,833
You have to feel sorry
for poor Tomoe.

13
00:02:03,916 --> 00:02:06,166
How awful to serve a human.

14
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:08,625
This is unforgivable!

15
00:02:11,666 --> 00:02:13,333
Nanami Momozono.

16
00:02:13,416 --> 00:02:17,250
Whether you are a human
worthy of being a god or not.

17
00:02:17,333 --> 00:02:18,583
I, Lady Narukami,

18
00:02:18,666 --> 00:02:22,833
god of thunder--Shall
take your measure, myself!

19
00:02:29,791 --> 00:02:32,458
Oh, my, seven lightening
strikes to the east.

20
00:02:32,541 --> 00:02:35,416
Narukami must be having
another one of her tantrums.

21
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,958
It is growing closer and closer.

22
00:02:38,041 --> 00:02:40,458
By the looks of it,
she is heading this way.

23
00:02:40,541 --> 00:02:42,125
I can't believe I overslept!

24
00:02:42,208 --> 00:02:42,916
Tomoe!

25
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:43,833
Why didn't you wake me up?

26
00:02:43,916 --> 00:02:45,083
I'm gonna be late now!

27
00:02:45,166 --> 00:02:46,708
Are you ready for breakfast?

28
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:48,166
We are having rice porridge.

29
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:50,833
I have added a thick
Yoshino sauce to it...

30
00:02:50,916 --> 00:02:51,541
Sorry!

31
00:02:51,625 --> 00:02:52,916
Don't have time to eat!

32
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,625
Hold it.

33
00:02:54,708 --> 00:02:57,416
You are leaving without your
lunch, and your head gear.

34
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:58,625
Your point?

35
00:02:59,958 --> 00:03:00,750
Just put it on!

36
00:03:00,833 --> 00:03:02,250
I'm not going there to fight!

37
00:03:02,333 --> 00:03:04,458
I go to school to learn,
you big freak!

38
00:03:04,541 --> 00:03:06,958
There is a visitor
coming to the shrine today.

39
00:03:07,041 --> 00:03:09,416
Therefore, I cannot
step away from here.

40
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:11,958
To be honest,
I am worried for you.

41
00:03:12,041 --> 00:03:13,708
You must face it.

42
00:03:13,791 --> 00:03:15,750
You are as weak as a wee bug.

43
00:03:15,833 --> 00:03:17,041
I'm going.

44
00:03:17,125 --> 00:03:18,500
Nanami!

45
00:03:18,583 --> 00:03:20,958
Why does he have
to worry so much?

46
00:03:22,416 --> 00:03:24,333
Looks like we might
be in for some rain.

47
00:03:25,416 --> 00:03:28,041
Darling Nanami's training
as a god and life at school

48
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:30,000
are both going swimmingly!

49
00:03:30,083 --> 00:03:32,250
Or at least we'd all really
like for that to happen.

50
00:03:32,333 --> 00:03:34,791
Instead, a storm's a brewin'.

51
00:03:35,791 --> 00:03:37,291
I heard Kurama
isn't feeling well,

52
00:03:37,375 --> 00:03:38,666
so he's not coming to school.

53
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:40,250
What?

54
00:03:41,875 --> 00:03:43,041
Lady Nanami!

55
00:03:43,125 --> 00:03:44,000
What the crap?

56
00:03:44,083 --> 00:03:45,083
You guys?

57
00:03:46,083 --> 00:03:46,708
Down.

58
00:03:46,791 --> 00:03:49,000
Why are you in my bag?

59
00:03:49,083 --> 00:03:51,166
We are here on
Master Tomoe's orders.

60
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:53,250
We will-o-the-wisps shall
guard you and make sure

61
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:56,000
you are safe as safe can be.

62
00:03:56,083 --> 00:03:58,541
Hey, uh, Nanami?

63
00:03:58,625 --> 00:03:59,583
They're just kids.

64
00:03:59,666 --> 00:04:00,791
It's not what you think!

65
00:04:00,875 --> 00:04:03,583
So is Tomoe not
coming to school today?

66
00:04:03,666 --> 00:04:04,375
What?

67
00:04:04,458 --> 00:04:06,083
I-um-- Oh yeah, he's not.

68
00:04:06,166 --> 00:04:06,916
No sir.

69
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,166
Not today.

70
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:10,333
There is no need for you
to worry, Lady Nanami!

71
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:13,375
Normal people do not
have the ability to see us!

72
00:04:16,041 --> 00:04:17,708
How very odd.

73
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:20,875
I thought Narukami was
surely headed this way but

74
00:04:20,958 --> 00:04:23,333
the rainclouds have
passed completely.

75
00:04:23,416 --> 00:04:25,541
Perhaps I was
worried for nothing.

76
00:04:28,041 --> 00:04:31,458
The clouds have moved in the
direction of Nanami's school.

77
00:04:31,541 --> 00:04:33,166
Surely not.

78
00:04:34,708 --> 00:04:36,041
Thanks!

79
00:04:36,125 --> 00:04:38,583
You guys saved me by bringing
my lunch along with you!

80
00:04:38,666 --> 00:04:40,208
Delicious!

81
00:04:40,291 --> 00:04:42,833
Was Mister Mikage like a
food lover or something?

82
00:04:42,916 --> 00:04:45,166
All the meals Tomoe
makes me are so good!

83
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:46,708
Oh, no.

84
00:04:46,791 --> 00:04:48,875
Neither we, nor gods, are in the
habit of partaking of meals.

85
00:04:48,958 --> 00:04:51,166
You must because your body
is of flesh and blood.

86
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:53,833
In spite of how it may seem,
Master Tomoe studies daily

87
00:04:53,916 --> 00:04:56,083
as he devotes himself
to cooking for you.

88
00:04:56,166 --> 00:04:57,250
I had no clue.

89
00:04:57,333 --> 00:04:58,791
Oh, yes.

90
00:04:58,875 --> 00:05:01,625
Master Tomoe thinks of you first
in all things at all times.

91
00:05:01,708 --> 00:05:04,125
To be honest,
I am worried for you.

92
00:05:05,416 --> 00:05:06,166
Whatever.

93
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:07,583
There is no way that's true.

94
00:05:07,666 --> 00:05:08,666
But it is true.

95
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:10,166
Master Tomoe's
regard for you is--

96
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:11,458
Hey!

97
00:05:11,541 --> 00:05:12,666
You're not supposed
to tease a girl like that!

98
00:05:20,166 --> 00:05:22,541
You are Nanami Momozono?

99
00:05:22,625 --> 00:05:23,791
A yokai?

100
00:05:23,875 --> 00:05:24,916
Oh no!

101
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,375
I've erected a barrier.

102
00:05:26,458 --> 00:05:28,041
We shall not be disturbed.

103
00:05:28,125 --> 00:05:31,208
The four of us might as well
be the only ones here.

104
00:05:31,291 --> 00:05:34,041
I am a god who maintains
a shrine in the heavens.

105
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:36,208
The Lady Narukami,
god of thunder.

106
00:05:36,291 --> 00:05:37,416
I have heard of the events

107
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,958
which led to your
becoming a land god.

108
00:05:40,041 --> 00:05:41,750
Tis a grave responsibility.

109
00:05:41,833 --> 00:05:44,333
And to have it thrust
upon you like it was--

110
00:05:44,416 --> 00:05:46,708
That must have been
so difficult for you.

111
00:05:46,791 --> 00:05:48,250
Never fear, darling.

112
00:05:48,333 --> 00:05:51,375
Your newfound troubles shall
come to an end this very day.

113
00:05:51,458 --> 00:05:52,458
Troubles?

114
00:05:52,541 --> 00:05:53,875
I, Lady Narukami,

115
00:05:53,958 --> 00:05:56,750
shall take over the
Mikage shrine in your stead.

116
00:05:56,833 --> 00:05:57,458
Oh no.

117
00:05:57,541 --> 00:05:58,541
You've got it all wrong.

118
00:05:58,625 --> 00:06:01,208
I'm not troubled by anything.

119
00:06:01,291 --> 00:06:04,125
I mean, I have the
will-o-the-wisps and Tomoe.

120
00:06:04,208 --> 00:06:06,208
They're wonderful to me.

121
00:06:06,291 --> 00:06:09,041
I actually think of the
shrine as my home now.

122
00:06:09,125 --> 00:06:10,666
You're very kind.

123
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:12,583
I don't wanna leave
the shrine, though.

124
00:06:12,666 --> 00:06:14,375
Oh, but that is unacceptable!

125
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,416
Nanami!

126
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:17,375
Tomoe!

127
00:06:17,458 --> 00:06:18,458
Are you all right?

128
00:06:18,541 --> 00:06:20,250
As expected, you have come.

129
00:06:20,333 --> 00:06:21,291
Master Tomoe!

130
00:06:21,375 --> 00:06:22,875
Lady Nanami is in trouble!

131
00:06:22,958 --> 00:06:23,708
Very well.

132
00:06:23,791 --> 00:06:25,500
Why are you here, Narukami?

133
00:06:25,583 --> 00:06:26,375
Let her go.

134
00:06:26,458 --> 00:06:28,208
Can you not see she is scared?

135
00:06:28,291 --> 00:06:29,958
Remember, she is my
lady and mistress.

136
00:06:30,041 --> 00:06:33,583
A weak little girl like this
is your lady and mistress?

137
00:06:33,666 --> 00:06:34,666
How sad.

138
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:35,541
What should I do?

139
00:06:35,625 --> 00:06:37,000
Oh, crap!

140
00:06:37,083 --> 00:06:39,375
I find it irritating to see
you subordinating yourself

141
00:06:39,458 --> 00:06:40,666
to a mere human.

142
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:42,541
It is none of your business!

143
00:06:42,625 --> 00:06:44,250
I expected this as well.

144
00:06:44,333 --> 00:06:46,125
That is the reason I
borrowed the Lucky Mallet

145
00:06:46,208 --> 00:06:47,750
from Lord Daikokuten.

146
00:06:49,416 --> 00:06:50,375
Here we go!

147
00:06:50,458 --> 00:06:52,791
Time to grow smaller, Tomoe!

148
00:06:54,375 --> 00:06:55,000
What?

149
00:06:55,083 --> 00:06:56,208
Tomoe!

150
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:00,958
Tomoe!

151
00:07:01,791 --> 00:07:03,458
And you are next.

152
00:07:12,041 --> 00:07:13,416
Mikage's mark.

153
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,375
It belongs to me, forthwith.

154
00:07:15,458 --> 00:07:18,916
And with that done, you
are no longer a land god.

155
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,750
Go and live your life, human.

156
00:07:20,833 --> 00:07:24,541
You may now do so as befits
someone in your humble position.

157
00:07:24,625 --> 00:07:25,875
Goodbye, dear.

158
00:07:33,458 --> 00:07:34,583
Tomoe, no!

159
00:07:34,666 --> 00:07:37,166
Tomoe, if that small
size does not suit you,

160
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:38,708
come to the shrine.

161
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:41,125
If you will become my familiar,
I shall restore you at once.

162
00:07:41,208 --> 00:07:42,000
You'll be okay.

163
00:07:42,083 --> 00:07:43,375
Hold on!

164
00:07:43,458 --> 00:07:46,458
Now, will-o-the-wisps,
show me the way immediately.

165
00:07:46,541 --> 00:07:47,708
Yes, ma'am.

166
00:07:47,791 --> 00:07:49,791
Lady Nanami,
we are so very sorry.

167
00:07:49,875 --> 00:07:51,541
But we are spirits
of the shrine.

168
00:07:51,625 --> 00:07:54,416
We have no choice but to serve
our new lady and mistress.

169
00:07:55,333 --> 00:07:57,750
I hope you both have
a wonderful day.

170
00:08:11,458 --> 00:08:13,166
Well, this is great.

171
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:14,833
We're both homeless now.

172
00:08:14,916 --> 00:08:16,416
I'm sorry.

173
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,583
I don't have any money.

174
00:08:18,666 --> 00:08:20,916
And Tomoe's so tiny.

175
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,625
I have no idea what to do.

176
00:08:24,708 --> 00:08:27,125
It is simple; you should
do as you please.

177
00:08:27,208 --> 00:08:29,708
This is the world
of humans, is it not?

178
00:08:29,791 --> 00:08:32,250
As a human, you will find a
place for yourself in no time

179
00:08:32,333 --> 00:08:35,083
at all if you put
your mind to it.

180
00:08:35,166 --> 00:08:37,458
As for me, I do not
have the ability

181
00:08:37,541 --> 00:08:39,333
to look after you anymore.

182
00:08:41,375 --> 00:08:42,291
Tomoe!

183
00:08:42,375 --> 00:08:43,041
Are you all right?

184
00:08:43,125 --> 00:08:44,500
Tomoe!

185
00:08:44,583 --> 00:08:46,500
He has a terrible fever!

186
00:08:46,583 --> 00:08:47,875
What do I do?

187
00:08:47,958 --> 00:08:48,958
Tomoe?

188
00:08:49,041 --> 00:08:50,666
Oh, what do I do?

189
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,458
I'm such an idiot.

190
00:08:54,541 --> 00:08:56,958
Tomoe's not human, so even if
I could get him to a doctor,

191
00:08:57,041 --> 00:08:58,875
what's the point?

192
00:08:58,958 --> 00:09:00,333
He's so hot.

193
00:09:00,416 --> 00:09:01,666
At the very least,

194
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:03,833
I need to find a place
where he can sleep safely.

195
00:09:04,916 --> 00:09:06,833
Nanami?

196
00:09:06,916 --> 00:09:09,625
What are you doing out
in weather like this?

197
00:09:09,708 --> 00:09:10,458
Hey.

198
00:09:10,541 --> 00:09:11,750
Hold on.

199
00:09:11,833 --> 00:09:14,625
What happened to
your land god's mark?

200
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,333
He's turned into an awfully
cute little thing, hasn't he?

201
00:09:24,416 --> 00:09:25,458
I know you had
to stay home

202
00:09:25,541 --> 00:09:27,083
because you
weren't feeling well.

203
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:29,125
I'm sorry for
barging in on you.

204
00:09:29,208 --> 00:09:30,625
Not feeling well?

205
00:09:30,708 --> 00:09:33,583
Oh, that was just
an excuse to miss class.

206
00:09:33,666 --> 00:09:35,666
Our school is less than
sympathetic to the plight

207
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:38,416
of this talented pop star
and the work he must do.

208
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:40,583
Although, in all fairness,
they've probably never had

209
00:09:40,666 --> 00:09:43,041
someone quite as famous
as yours truly enrolled

210
00:09:43,125 --> 00:09:44,166
at their school before.

211
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,041
Hey, you're a tengu yokai,
aren't you?

212
00:09:46,125 --> 00:09:48,041
Look, I spent a lot of time
convincing people I was

213
00:09:48,125 --> 00:09:49,958
a fallen angel,
so why bring that up?

214
00:09:50,041 --> 00:09:51,125
Because--

215
00:09:51,208 --> 00:09:53,958
I wanted to find
a yokai doctor.

216
00:09:55,291 --> 00:09:58,250
I'm afraid that
won't help much.

217
00:09:58,333 --> 00:10:00,625
He's been regressed
in body only.

218
00:10:00,708 --> 00:10:03,291
So, his original yokai
powers can't settle in.

219
00:10:03,375 --> 00:10:07,375
They're out of his control and
that's what's causing his fever.

220
00:10:07,458 --> 00:10:08,875
Then--

221
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:12,333
He won't get better unless
he's restored to his old body.

222
00:10:12,416 --> 00:10:15,833
If you will become my familiar,
I shall restore you at once.

223
00:10:17,375 --> 00:10:21,000
This'll only be temporary
fix, but it's worth a shot.

224
00:10:21,083 --> 00:10:24,750
It's an old secret remedy that's
been passed down in my family.

225
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:25,625
Here you go.

226
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:27,416
Be warned, it's bitter as hell.

227
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:28,958
Say "Ah".

228
00:10:29,041 --> 00:10:31,291
And maybe try being a little
grateful to me for this pill,

229
00:10:31,375 --> 00:10:32,500
fox.

230
00:10:36,375 --> 00:10:37,500
Tomoe.

231
00:10:39,291 --> 00:10:41,458
What a relief.

232
00:10:41,541 --> 00:10:43,666
He seems to be resting easier.

233
00:10:45,541 --> 00:10:47,666
Please let him get better.

234
00:10:52,625 --> 00:10:55,458
Here, you can have
a bamboo-leaf rice cake.

235
00:10:55,541 --> 00:10:56,750
Yukiji.

236
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:00,875
Thank you.

237
00:11:09,708 --> 00:11:10,541
Tomoe!

238
00:11:10,625 --> 00:11:11,250
Oh good!

239
00:11:11,333 --> 00:11:12,958
You're finally awake!

240
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:17,000
I was so worried!

241
00:11:17,083 --> 00:11:18,250
Are you thirsty?

242
00:11:18,333 --> 00:11:20,416
Is there anything
I can get you?

243
00:11:22,375 --> 00:11:25,083
Bamboo-leaf rice cake.

244
00:11:25,166 --> 00:11:26,541
I would like some.

245
00:11:28,958 --> 00:11:30,541
Kurama!

246
00:11:30,625 --> 00:11:32,000
I need your kitchen
and some money!

247
00:11:32,083 --> 00:11:33,333
Money?

248
00:11:33,416 --> 00:11:34,958
So.

249
00:11:35,041 --> 00:11:37,833
You mean you actually know how
to make bamboo-leaf rice cake?

250
00:11:37,916 --> 00:11:40,875
My mother used to make it for
me when I was a little girl.

251
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:42,041
I'm honored.

252
00:11:42,125 --> 00:11:44,166
He's never asked me
for a single thing.

253
00:11:45,583 --> 00:11:47,791
I couldn't be
happier to make it.

254
00:11:50,125 --> 00:11:52,291
I hope you like it, Tomoe.

255
00:11:52,375 --> 00:11:54,375
After all, I made
them just for you!

256
00:11:54,458 --> 00:11:56,333
Average.

257
00:11:56,416 --> 00:11:58,500
I guess he's normal
Tomoe on the inside.

258
00:11:58,583 --> 00:11:59,541
Nanami.

259
00:11:59,625 --> 00:12:00,625
Yeah?

260
00:12:03,958 --> 00:12:05,291
I am grateful.

261
00:12:10,125 --> 00:12:10,791
No prob.

262
00:12:10,875 --> 00:12:11,958
You're welcome.

263
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,666
Yeah, I think I have a virus.

264
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:16,416
I won't be at school today.

265
00:12:23,791 --> 00:12:25,416
It is raining!

266
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:28,541
The roof is leaking everywhere!

267
00:12:28,625 --> 00:12:30,875
What kind of
pathetic shrine is this?

268
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:33,625
We are so very sorry.

269
00:12:33,708 --> 00:12:35,458
Master Tomoe had been
maintaining it with

270
00:12:35,541 --> 00:12:37,750
his yokai powers and now,
without him, the shrine has

271
00:12:37,833 --> 00:12:40,041
reverted back to
its original state.

272
00:12:40,125 --> 00:12:41,541
Of course.

273
00:12:41,625 --> 00:12:43,875
I do not know why I believed
that fox would ever give up

274
00:12:43,958 --> 00:12:45,666
and come running back here.

275
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:47,666
Attention, please.

276
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:49,208
Bring me Tomoe!

277
00:12:49,291 --> 00:12:50,625
As you wish!

278
00:12:53,291 --> 00:12:54,625
What is this?

279
00:12:54,708 --> 00:12:57,833
It's fuzzy, but
tickles at the same time.

280
00:12:59,833 --> 00:13:01,250
Kurama!

281
00:13:01,333 --> 00:13:01,958
What the?

282
00:13:02,041 --> 00:13:02,791
Who's calling?

283
00:13:02,875 --> 00:13:04,791
Why was I sleeping with you?

284
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:09,333
I'm not gonna not sleep in my
bed, so if you don't like that.

285
00:13:09,416 --> 00:13:10,541
Sleep on the couch.

286
00:13:10,625 --> 00:13:12,583
So, Tomoe can still
sleep in the bed, then?

287
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:14,125
Yeah, like hell!

288
00:13:14,208 --> 00:13:15,083
Damn fox.

289
00:13:15,166 --> 00:13:16,916
He can sleep on the floor.

290
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,083
You're a different story.

291
00:13:18,166 --> 00:13:19,750
I don't mind you in my bed.

292
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:22,916
I will kill you fox.

293
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,291
I will kill you!

294
00:13:27,791 --> 00:13:29,500
I think we just fell
asleep after that!

295
00:13:29,583 --> 00:13:31,833
What kind of a girl
does that make me?

296
00:13:31,916 --> 00:13:33,666
Remember, he is a yokai.

297
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:34,666
Tomoe!

298
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:36,333
How do you feel?

299
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:38,458
Try to be on your
guard a little.

300
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:41,666
What did you say about me, fox?

301
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:44,666
Oh, is the little boy going
wakey-wakey already?

302
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:47,375
It looks like your teething
fever hasn't gone down, yet.

303
00:13:47,458 --> 00:13:49,750
Don't be so rough
with him, okay!

304
00:13:49,833 --> 00:13:52,000
Getting a girl to come to
your defense like that.

305
00:13:52,083 --> 00:13:53,541
Not bad, Tomoe.

306
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:57,000
You are the reason she's in my
house in the first place.

307
00:13:57,083 --> 00:13:58,291
Remember that.

308
00:13:58,375 --> 00:14:00,250
He has the right of it.

309
00:14:00,333 --> 00:14:03,250
What pains me is not the fever.

310
00:14:03,333 --> 00:14:05,208
This is so irritating.

311
00:14:05,291 --> 00:14:07,625
We have to get Tomoe
back to normal.

312
00:14:07,708 --> 00:14:10,208
If he became tiny because
of the Lucky Mallet.

313
00:14:10,291 --> 00:14:11,916
You'll most likely have
to use the same device

314
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,333
to make him bigger.

315
00:14:13,416 --> 00:14:15,708
You need to get your
hands on that mallet.

316
00:14:15,791 --> 00:14:17,666
Do you think you can
get it from Lady Narukami?

317
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:19,125
Oh my, look at the time.

318
00:14:19,208 --> 00:14:20,166
Where are you going?

319
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:22,000
Rehearsal for
a live performance.

320
00:14:22,083 --> 00:14:22,583
Oh.

321
00:14:22,666 --> 00:14:23,666
Right.

322
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:25,458
Well, someone looks
awfully forlorn.

323
00:14:25,541 --> 00:14:26,125
What?

324
00:14:26,208 --> 00:14:27,125
No, I don't.

325
00:14:27,208 --> 00:14:28,666
I look fine.

326
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:31,083
Here's the spare key to my house
along with my phone number.

327
00:14:31,166 --> 00:14:32,666
And some money.

328
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:34,541
If anything happens,
give me a call.

329
00:14:34,625 --> 00:14:35,083
Oh.

330
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:36,541
Wow, thank you.

331
00:14:37,875 --> 00:14:39,041
Tomoe.

332
00:14:39,125 --> 00:14:40,958
I'm gonna go run
a couple of errands.

333
00:14:41,041 --> 00:14:43,083
Is there anything you
need me to pick up?

334
00:14:48,416 --> 00:14:50,250
Did you hear me?

335
00:14:50,333 --> 00:14:52,083
I shall go.

336
00:14:52,166 --> 00:14:53,750
I feel fine now.

337
00:14:55,541 --> 00:14:58,875
The reason I feel irritated
is because of this body.

338
00:14:58,958 --> 00:15:00,333
So what about your school?

339
00:15:00,416 --> 00:15:01,208
Oh.

340
00:15:01,291 --> 00:15:02,791
It's Saturday; no school today.

341
00:15:02,875 --> 00:15:05,208
Getting you back to normal
is more important anyway.

342
00:15:05,291 --> 00:15:07,208
You should think
about yourself.

343
00:15:07,291 --> 00:15:09,500
I shall take care
of my own affairs.

344
00:15:09,583 --> 00:15:11,458
You shall?

345
00:15:11,541 --> 00:15:12,750
I don't know how you can.

346
00:15:12,833 --> 00:15:15,166
You're way too tiny.

347
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:17,916
You have been restored
to your human self.

348
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,625
You should live as a human.

349
00:15:19,708 --> 00:15:21,708
I can and will
live as I please.

350
00:15:21,791 --> 00:15:23,166
Tomoe.

351
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:26,166
I wonder if he's planning
to go to Narukami.

352
00:15:27,708 --> 00:15:28,791
Oh, no, Tomoe!

353
00:15:28,875 --> 00:15:30,833
Your fever's gotten worse!

354
00:15:30,916 --> 00:15:32,291
Master Tomoe!

355
00:15:32,375 --> 00:15:34,500
We have been searching for you!

356
00:15:34,583 --> 00:15:37,250
We have come to escort
you back, Master Tomoe.

357
00:15:37,333 --> 00:15:39,458
Lady Narukami is terribly
concerned for your well

358
00:15:39,541 --> 00:15:41,875
being and is awaiting
your return at the shrine.

359
00:15:41,958 --> 00:15:43,500
After what she did to Tomoe,

360
00:15:43,583 --> 00:15:45,875
she has some nerve saying
that she's concerned.

361
00:15:45,958 --> 00:15:48,125
Tomoe and I are like family,
and we've been driven away

362
00:15:48,208 --> 00:15:50,166
from our home together!

363
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:53,916
It doesn't matter if
I'm human and he's a yokai.

364
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,708
I'm gonna find a way
to take care of him.

365
00:16:00,666 --> 00:16:02,833
There is no way
for that to happen.

366
00:16:02,916 --> 00:16:05,166
You are incapable
of doing anything.

367
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:06,583
Face it.

368
00:16:06,666 --> 00:16:08,000
Tomoe?

369
00:16:08,083 --> 00:16:12,458
To live life burdening
you----the thought enrages me.

370
00:16:12,541 --> 00:16:14,041
You there, lion-dogs.

371
00:16:14,125 --> 00:16:15,500
Take me to the shrine.

372
00:16:15,583 --> 00:16:16,916
Yes, sir.

373
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,541
You're leaving?

374
00:16:18,625 --> 00:16:21,291
Are you serious?

375
00:16:21,375 --> 00:16:23,875
I believe what pains me more
than anything is being seen

376
00:16:23,958 --> 00:16:27,000
by her while I am in
this pathetic state.

377
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:31,291
Farewell, then, Nanami.

378
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:39,333
Tomoe, you're such a jerk!

379
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:41,708
Oh, dear.

380
00:16:41,791 --> 00:16:43,041
They split right on up.

381
00:16:43,125 --> 00:16:44,375
Tragic.

382
00:16:44,458 --> 00:16:45,541
What now?

383
00:16:47,083 --> 00:16:48,958
Oh, Tomoe, I feel as though
I have been waiting for you

384
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:51,916
to show up now forever and ever.

385
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,375
I already know, so no
explanation needed.

386
00:16:54,458 --> 00:16:55,791
And in the end, well,

387
00:16:55,875 --> 00:16:58,541
you had nowhere else to go
other than this shrine.

388
00:17:00,041 --> 00:17:02,583
If you have nowhere else to go.

389
00:17:02,666 --> 00:17:05,083
You can stay with
me at my shrine.

390
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:10,083
Now, offer up your
whole life to me.

391
00:17:10,166 --> 00:17:11,500
Is it not exciting?

392
00:17:11,583 --> 00:17:13,708
You get to become my personal
possession for all time!

393
00:17:13,791 --> 00:17:16,250
Now seal the contract
and be my familiar!

394
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:18,750
Are you mocking me?

395
00:17:18,833 --> 00:17:21,583
Tomoe, get back
here immediately!

396
00:17:25,041 --> 00:17:26,083
Nanami?

397
00:17:28,666 --> 00:17:29,875
Well, well.

398
00:17:29,958 --> 00:17:31,916
You've got quite the
honor guard here for you.

399
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:32,708
Honor guard?

400
00:17:32,791 --> 00:17:33,958
Forget about it.

401
00:17:34,041 --> 00:17:36,500
What are you doing sitting out
here like this?

402
00:17:36,583 --> 00:17:37,916
I was waiting for you.

403
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,666
I wanted to say thank you.

404
00:17:41,333 --> 00:17:43,541
Tomoe went back to the shrine.

405
00:17:43,625 --> 00:17:47,041
I guess he decided to be
Narukami's familiar.

406
00:17:47,125 --> 00:17:50,916
I tried but I
couldn't stop him.

407
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,208
You are incapable
of doing anything.

408
00:17:53,291 --> 00:17:55,666
I--I couldn't do anything.

409
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:57,125
Oh stop.

410
00:17:57,208 --> 00:17:58,500
There's no point crying over
a little thing like that.

411
00:17:58,583 --> 00:17:59,041
Hey!

412
00:17:59,125 --> 00:18:00,708
I am not crying.

413
00:18:00,791 --> 00:18:02,541
And what do you mean
by a little thing?

414
00:18:02,625 --> 00:18:03,708
All right.

415
00:18:06,083 --> 00:18:07,250
Here's a parting gift for you,

416
00:18:07,333 --> 00:18:09,583
since you've gone
back to being human.

417
00:18:09,666 --> 00:18:12,250
By having a physical piece
of a yokai, you can see all

418
00:18:12,333 --> 00:18:14,291
of the things that are
invisible to the human eye

419
00:18:14,375 --> 00:18:15,833
that you might be missing.

420
00:18:15,916 --> 00:18:16,708
Like what?

421
00:18:16,791 --> 00:18:18,666
Lady Nanami!

422
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:21,458
Onikiri, Kotetsu, you, too?

423
00:18:21,541 --> 00:18:23,083
When'd you get here?

424
00:18:23,166 --> 00:18:25,375
They've both been crying next
to you this whole time.

425
00:18:25,458 --> 00:18:27,125
We are in dreadful trouble!

426
00:18:27,208 --> 00:18:30,041
Master Tomoe has evaded Lady
Narukami and hidden somewhere

427
00:18:30,125 --> 00:18:31,166
in the shrine!

428
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:33,041
It has greatly
angered the Lady, too.

429
00:18:33,125 --> 00:18:35,083
At this rate, she is
practically ready to destroy us,

430
00:18:35,166 --> 00:18:36,458
shrine and all!

431
00:18:36,541 --> 00:18:39,333
Lady Nanami, please save
Master Tomoe and the shrine!

432
00:18:39,416 --> 00:18:40,875
We need you!

433
00:18:40,958 --> 00:18:43,125
You are incapable
of doing anything.

434
00:18:43,208 --> 00:18:44,833
Face it.

435
00:18:47,666 --> 00:18:48,875
'Kay, let's go!

436
00:18:48,958 --> 00:18:50,916
We have the Night Fog
Carriage waiting.

437
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,541
Come, please get on.

438
00:18:53,541 --> 00:18:54,208
Your feather.

439
00:18:54,291 --> 00:18:55,166
Can I borrow it?

440
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:56,416
I have plenty of feathers.

441
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:57,708
You can have it.

442
00:18:57,791 --> 00:18:58,833
Thank you.

443
00:19:06,083 --> 00:19:07,625
We still cannot find him!

444
00:19:07,708 --> 00:19:08,250
The attic!

445
00:19:08,333 --> 00:19:09,125
The basement!

446
00:19:09,208 --> 00:19:10,916
We searched for him everywhere!

447
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,041
Curse you, Tomoe.

448
00:19:12,125 --> 00:19:13,708
Try to make a fool
out of me will you?

449
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:17,166
If that's what you want,
then fine!

450
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:19,125
I have no need for
this rundown shrine.

451
00:19:19,208 --> 00:19:20,625
I shall burn it to cinders!

452
00:19:20,708 --> 00:19:22,958
Hey, god lady!

453
00:19:23,041 --> 00:19:24,416
What kind of
twisted god goes out

454
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:26,458
and tries to destroy
her own shrine?

455
00:19:26,541 --> 00:19:27,416
Oh, great.

456
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,250
What are you doing here?

457
00:19:29,333 --> 00:19:31,625
If you're looking for Tomoe,
he has hidden.

458
00:19:31,708 --> 00:19:33,000
Oh yeah, well.

459
00:19:33,083 --> 00:19:35,250
If you let me,
I could find him easily.

460
00:19:35,333 --> 00:19:36,708
But that is up to you.

461
00:19:36,791 --> 00:19:39,125
You are a mere human; you
could not possibly find him!

462
00:19:39,208 --> 00:19:41,125
Maybe, but let's say that I do.

463
00:19:41,208 --> 00:19:42,166
You would have to swear to me,

464
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:44,000
that you'd turn him
back to normal.

465
00:19:44,083 --> 00:19:45,583
All right, I swear.

466
00:19:45,666 --> 00:19:48,250
Then sit back,
and I'll find him.

467
00:19:48,333 --> 00:19:49,833
I can't find him.

468
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:52,791
Poor Tomoe.

469
00:19:52,875 --> 00:19:55,833
If he still has that fever, he
might be passed out somewhere.

470
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:05,416
Lady Nanami?

471
00:20:12,875 --> 00:20:13,708
Here?

472
00:20:13,791 --> 00:20:14,791
Oh.

473
00:20:14,875 --> 00:20:16,708
That is Lord Mikage's
pocket mirror.

474
00:20:18,708 --> 00:20:21,125
I can feel him from
inside the mirror.

475
00:20:21,208 --> 00:20:23,875
Tomoe's body heat.

476
00:20:23,958 --> 00:20:25,583
It's so hot.

477
00:20:29,833 --> 00:20:31,250
There he is.

478
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:33,875
Tomoe.

479
00:20:39,125 --> 00:20:40,625
Tomoe.

480
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:44,833
Let's go home.

481
00:20:57,833 --> 00:20:59,541
Hiding within a
silly mirror belonging

482
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:01,625
to the previous land god.

483
00:21:01,708 --> 00:21:04,625
That is quite the
show of faithfulness.

484
00:21:04,708 --> 00:21:08,208
If you will not be mine,
I do not want you.

485
00:21:08,291 --> 00:21:09,791
Farewell.

486
00:21:09,875 --> 00:21:11,166
Good for you!

487
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:13,083
The shrine was so dilapidated,
she did not want it.

488
00:21:13,166 --> 00:21:15,291
And so, it is up to us
to deliver the Mallet,

489
00:21:15,375 --> 00:21:16,916
and the Mark!

490
00:21:17,875 --> 00:21:18,666
Cut the bull crap!

491
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:20,833
Why won't she face us herself?

492
00:21:20,916 --> 00:21:23,208
At any rate,
we shall return the mark.

493
00:21:26,375 --> 00:21:29,208
My body; I'm glowing.

494
00:21:29,291 --> 00:21:32,458
With that, the mark of the land
god is yours again, Lady Nanami.

495
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:34,708
Swing the Mallet
at Tomoe, please.

496
00:21:34,791 --> 00:21:38,166
Then at the same time say
to him "Grow bigger."

497
00:21:39,583 --> 00:21:41,708
That is your job, Lady Nanami.

498
00:21:45,125 --> 00:21:46,833
Grow bigger, Tomoe!

499
00:21:53,833 --> 00:21:55,541
I am restored.

500
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:02,166
It appears your hair has
grown at the same time.

501
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:03,458
What is wrong?

502
00:22:03,541 --> 00:22:04,083
Nothing.

503
00:22:04,166 --> 00:22:05,333
Nothing at all.

504
00:22:05,416 --> 00:22:07,708
Why am I feeling
this way about him?

505
00:22:07,791 --> 00:22:08,875
Wow, it looks like
the rain's let up!

506
00:22:08,958 --> 00:22:09,500
It let up!

507
00:22:09,583 --> 00:22:10,333
It totally let up!

508
00:22:10,416 --> 00:22:11,083
Wow that is just so awesome.

509
00:22:11,166 --> 00:22:11,750
Like so awesome.

510
00:22:11,833 --> 00:22:14,375
It seems I owe you.

511
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:15,000
That's right.

512
00:22:15,083 --> 00:22:16,583
You do!

513
00:22:16,666 --> 00:22:18,250
You have my thanks.

514
00:22:25,958 --> 00:22:28,291
The contract between
us is resealed.

515
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:33,958
I think that was his
way of his promising

516
00:22:34,041 --> 00:22:36,083
we would always be together.

517
00:23:47,541 --> 00:23:50,625
Nanami has ended up catching
a cold, so Tomoe disguises

518
00:23:50,708 --> 00:23:53,583
himself as her and goes
to school in her stead.

519
00:23:53,666 --> 00:23:55,791
And that is when
Kurama makes his move.

520
00:23:55,875 --> 00:23:58,041
Meanwhile, Mizuki
comes to see Nanami.

521
00:23:58,125 --> 00:24:01,000
Next time, "The God
Catches a Cold" Achoo!
