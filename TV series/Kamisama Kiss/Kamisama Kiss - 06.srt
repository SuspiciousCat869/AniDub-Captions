1
00:01:39,666 --> 00:01:42,250
This is the second day
I've been back at the shrine.

2
00:01:47,708 --> 00:01:51,541
And I've felt kind of weird
ever since yesterday.

3
00:01:51,625 --> 00:01:52,458
Nanami.

4
00:01:52,541 --> 00:01:54,083
Good morning.

5
00:01:55,541 --> 00:01:56,583
What is wrong?

6
00:01:56,666 --> 00:01:57,625
Your face is red.

7
00:01:57,708 --> 00:01:58,125
Shut up!

8
00:01:58,208 --> 00:01:59,416
No it's not!

9
00:02:00,666 --> 00:02:03,416
This wasn't how it
was supposed to be.

10
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:06,875
Since then, I've been alone here
with my heart in my throat.

11
00:02:10,708 --> 00:02:12,000
Is it bland?

12
00:02:12,083 --> 00:02:12,875
Soy sauce?

13
00:02:12,958 --> 00:02:14,000
No, thanks.

14
00:02:14,083 --> 00:02:16,083
It makes me a little mad.

15
00:02:16,166 --> 00:02:17,958
I mean, he's a fox, right?

16
00:02:18,041 --> 00:02:18,625
Stay cool.

17
00:02:18,708 --> 00:02:19,291
Stay cool.

18
00:02:19,375 --> 00:02:20,458
Keep it together.

19
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:26,166
As I suspected.

20
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:29,250
You are ill and have a fever.

21
00:02:29,333 --> 00:02:30,333
No way.

22
00:02:30,416 --> 00:02:32,500
Thirty-nine point eight!

23
00:02:32,583 --> 00:02:34,250
What a high temperature!

24
00:02:34,333 --> 00:02:36,833
Please stay home from
school, Lady Nanami!

25
00:02:36,916 --> 00:02:38,083
I wish I could.

26
00:02:38,166 --> 00:02:39,500
But I'll be fine.

27
00:02:39,583 --> 00:02:42,416
Besides, my attendance record
is hanging on the edge.

28
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:44,833
If I have any more absences,
I'll have to repeat the year.

29
00:02:44,916 --> 00:02:45,583
Master Tomoe!

30
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:46,875
You have to stop her!

31
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:49,708
No, let me go.

32
00:02:51,458 --> 00:02:54,625
I cannot allow you to go to
school in your current state.

33
00:02:54,708 --> 00:02:56,083
This will be good.

34
00:02:56,166 --> 00:02:58,666
Take time off from something
as unimportant as school.

35
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:00,333
Yeah, well just because
it's not godly doesn't

36
00:03:00,416 --> 00:03:01,833
mean it's not important!

37
00:03:01,916 --> 00:03:03,916
I'd also like to mention that
you're touching my hand!!

38
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,916
Trust me, I am saying this with
your best interests at heart.

39
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,875
In that case, why not change
yourself into Lady Nanami?

40
00:03:09,958 --> 00:03:11,666
Then, you could
go to school for her,

41
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:13,791
and she will not have
to have an absence!

42
00:03:15,458 --> 00:03:16,916
That's a great idea!

43
00:03:17,833 --> 00:03:20,750
And so, Nanami Momozono
will be taking the liberty of

44
00:03:20,833 --> 00:03:23,041
skipping her classes today.

45
00:03:23,125 --> 00:03:23,875
Yay.

46
00:03:23,958 --> 00:03:25,625
I feel like poo.

47
00:03:30,458 --> 00:03:32,833
Don't tell me
Nanami's out again today!

48
00:03:32,916 --> 00:03:35,125
No way she's not
gonna get held back.

49
00:03:35,208 --> 00:03:37,791
Anyone wanna bet on whether
Nanami comes back to school?

50
00:03:37,875 --> 00:03:39,708
Starting at three hundred!

51
00:03:39,791 --> 00:03:41,041
Isobe.

52
00:03:41,125 --> 00:03:43,125
Why do you get so excited
about anything Nanami?

53
00:03:43,208 --> 00:03:46,041
Are you sure that you
don't have a crush on her?

54
00:03:46,125 --> 00:03:47,458
Are you kidding me?

55
00:03:47,541 --> 00:03:49,750
Poor and daddy issues are
not exactly my style, bro!

56
00:03:50,666 --> 00:03:52,791
She's just too
easy to laugh at.

57
00:03:52,875 --> 00:03:54,500
Huh?

58
00:03:54,583 --> 00:03:58,375
Sorry to bother you, but I
believe you are in my seat.

59
00:03:58,458 --> 00:04:00,416
Would you mind moving?

60
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:01,291
Wait.

61
00:04:01,375 --> 00:04:03,291
What?

62
00:04:03,375 --> 00:04:05,333
Is that really Nanami?

63
00:04:07,125 --> 00:04:08,125
I don't get it.

64
00:04:08,208 --> 00:04:09,875
What's with that
aura around her?

65
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:13,791
Dude, is it just me, or did
her boobs get bigger, too?

66
00:04:13,875 --> 00:04:15,375
Curse you, Nanami.

67
00:04:15,458 --> 00:04:18,416
I will be certain to make
you pay for this atrocity.

68
00:04:24,291 --> 00:04:25,875
Morning everyone.

69
00:04:27,958 --> 00:04:30,041
For the first time in a week.

70
00:04:30,125 --> 00:04:32,875
The famous and talented pop
star Kurama has returned

71
00:04:32,958 --> 00:04:34,708
to your class.

72
00:04:34,791 --> 00:04:36,000
The tengu!

73
00:04:37,583 --> 00:04:39,291
I've brought you a souvenir.

74
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:41,333
Nanami.

75
00:04:41,416 --> 00:04:42,416
What's wrong?

76
00:04:44,208 --> 00:04:46,041
You seem to have become
more womanly since

77
00:04:46,125 --> 00:04:47,833
the last time I saw you.

78
00:04:47,916 --> 00:04:49,958
Nice rack.

79
00:04:50,041 --> 00:04:52,000
Foolish tengu.

80
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:55,666
My transformation
spell is perfect.

81
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:57,958
This school day is
sure to be a breeze.

82
00:04:58,041 --> 00:04:59,375
What?

83
00:04:59,458 --> 00:05:01,500
The fox goes here?

84
00:05:01,583 --> 00:05:02,791
Yeah.

85
00:05:02,875 --> 00:05:03,875
All the girls were
freaking out about it, too.

86
00:05:03,958 --> 00:05:05,916
I think he's out
sick today, though.

87
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,250
Don't worry, Kurama.

88
00:05:07,333 --> 00:05:09,541
I think you're like, so
much cooler than that guy.

89
00:05:09,625 --> 00:05:11,291
I made a copy of
my notes for you.

90
00:05:11,375 --> 00:05:12,333
I mean, if you want 'em.

91
00:05:12,416 --> 00:05:13,416
Seriously?

92
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:14,416
Damn it.

93
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:15,791
I swear, I go away for a week,

94
00:05:15,875 --> 00:05:18,166
and the whole
school falls apart.

95
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:20,583
I had planned on using the
time Nanami would be away

96
00:05:20,666 --> 00:05:23,625
from the fox to
grow closer to her.

97
00:05:23,708 --> 00:05:26,666
Apparently, I don't
have much time to waste.

98
00:05:27,666 --> 00:05:30,250
Okay, next page.

99
00:05:30,333 --> 00:05:32,166
Read from the top, if you would?

100
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:33,500
Nanami?

101
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:38,125
What the hell is this writing?

102
00:05:38,208 --> 00:05:39,541
Cat got your tongue?

103
00:05:39,625 --> 00:05:41,708
Read it now, please.

104
00:05:41,791 --> 00:05:43,041
If I may.

105
00:05:43,125 --> 00:05:45,583
Nanami's been sick, so she
can't speak very loudly.

106
00:05:45,666 --> 00:05:47,958
Although I can read it for her.

107
00:05:48,041 --> 00:05:50,333
All night their course lay
through intricate defiles

108
00:05:50,416 --> 00:05:52,708
and over irregular
and rock-strewn paths.

109
00:05:52,791 --> 00:05:54,375
More than once they lost
their way, but Hope's

110
00:05:54,458 --> 00:05:56,500
intimate knowledge of the
mountains enabled them

111
00:05:56,583 --> 00:05:57,625
to regain the track once more.

112
00:05:57,708 --> 00:05:59,625
He's always just so cool.

113
00:05:59,708 --> 00:06:02,333
Even his speaking
voice is like whoa.

114
00:06:02,416 --> 00:06:04,750
Did you enjoy that, Nanami?

115
00:06:06,458 --> 00:06:07,958
Okay?

116
00:06:08,041 --> 00:06:09,958
Second Period

117
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:16,875
All right, please stop,
Miss Momozono.

118
00:06:16,958 --> 00:06:18,625
You're the only one
who's out of tune.

119
00:06:18,708 --> 00:06:20,750
Try it again by yourself.

120
00:06:20,833 --> 00:06:24,791
♪ Radiant like the
sun shining in the-- ♪

121
00:06:24,875 --> 00:06:28,833
I hate to say it, but that part
just isn't working quite right.

122
00:06:28,916 --> 00:06:30,375
I do have a thought.

123
00:06:30,458 --> 00:06:32,250
Why don't we have a
professional singer show us

124
00:06:32,333 --> 00:06:34,500
how it should be done?

125
00:06:34,583 --> 00:06:35,791
Sure thing.

Lame.

138

I thought this
was a choral piece.

Do you like my singing, Nanami?

Nanami.

143
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,125
What's wrong?

144
00:07:21,208 --> 00:07:23,166
You seem like you're
in a bad mood, today.

145
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:24,750
Ya' know, if something's
bothering you,

146
00:07:24,833 --> 00:07:26,291
you can always
talk to me about it.

147
00:07:26,375 --> 00:07:28,833
I will say this
to you only once.

148
00:07:28,916 --> 00:07:29,708
You suck.

149
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:32,416
Do not follow me around.

150
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:35,333
I know you are after my
heart quite literally.

151
00:07:35,416 --> 00:07:38,291
For that is the way to
obtain my status as a god.

152
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:39,375
So, back off.

153
00:07:39,458 --> 00:07:40,666
Oh, no.

154
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:42,750
Is that's what you've
been agonizing about.

155
00:07:42,833 --> 00:07:45,208
Well, I'm sorry
you thought that.

156
00:07:45,291 --> 00:07:46,833
But you've got me all wrong.

157
00:07:46,916 --> 00:07:48,250
Why is he touching her?

158
00:07:48,333 --> 00:07:49,875
Oh, the horror!

159
00:07:49,958 --> 00:07:51,958
I will tell you what
I really desire.

160
00:07:52,041 --> 00:07:53,583
Your love.

161
00:07:57,291 --> 00:07:59,083
Touch me again and you die.

162
00:07:59,166 --> 00:08:02,250
I can't believe you
hit me in the face.

163
00:08:02,333 --> 00:08:03,541
Nanami.

164
00:08:03,625 --> 00:08:05,750
I wanted to mention
something to you.

165
00:08:05,833 --> 00:08:07,041
In all seriousness,

166
00:08:07,125 --> 00:08:09,958
it has to do with the
miasma in the air here.

167
00:08:10,041 --> 00:08:11,291
It's grown heavier.

168
00:08:11,375 --> 00:08:14,333
Don't go into dark
spaces by yourself.

169
00:08:14,416 --> 00:08:15,833
Miasma?

170
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:24,583
Yes.

171
00:08:24,666 --> 00:08:28,000
There is definitely a
heavier presence than before.

172
00:08:28,083 --> 00:08:31,291
Darkness is the entrance
to the world over yonder.

173
00:08:31,375 --> 00:08:37,375
The miasma's must mean that
an entrance is open nearby.

174
00:08:37,458 --> 00:08:40,500
Apparently, the tengu is not
as asinine as I thought.

175
00:08:41,541 --> 00:08:42,458
Ami!

176
00:08:42,541 --> 00:08:45,000
Hurry up, or we're
gonna be late!

177
00:08:45,083 --> 00:08:46,583
Yeah, I know;
hold on just a sec.

178
00:08:46,666 --> 00:08:48,708
I can't find my headband.

179
00:08:48,791 --> 00:08:49,875
I could swear it's in here.

180
00:08:49,958 --> 00:08:51,125
You're so slow.

181
00:08:51,208 --> 00:08:52,541
I'll just meet you there!

182
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:55,250
Come on.

183
00:08:55,333 --> 00:08:56,833
Kei, you turned
the lights off on me!

184
00:08:56,916 --> 00:08:59,625
You know how dark it and
scary it gets down here!

185
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:03,000
Are you still there?

186
00:09:03,083 --> 00:09:05,625
Oh no; I'm in here by myself.

187
00:09:05,708 --> 00:09:07,875
Stupid basement
and it's no windows,

188
00:09:07,958 --> 00:09:10,250
I can't see anything at all.

189
00:09:11,416 --> 00:09:11,958
Oh.

190
00:09:12,041 --> 00:09:13,541
Kei, I hate you!

191
00:09:13,625 --> 00:09:16,083
Who's a cute, cute little girl?

192
00:09:16,166 --> 00:09:19,916
Does she have the sweet,
sweet taste of candy?

193
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,333
What flavor are you, precious?

194
00:09:22,416 --> 00:09:23,750
I lick.

195
00:09:23,833 --> 00:09:24,875
Strawberry!

196
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:26,333
Yummy!

197
00:09:27,125 --> 00:09:28,041
Someone!

198
00:09:28,125 --> 00:09:29,416
Help!

199
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:36,833
Finally.

200
00:09:36,916 --> 00:09:38,166
There you are.

201
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:41,083
Oh, Nanami, I saw a ghost!

202
00:09:41,166 --> 00:09:42,250
A ghost!

203
00:09:42,333 --> 00:09:43,583
There was a ghost
and it licked my face!

204
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:45,916
And then it told me I
tasted like strawberries!

205
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,708
Yes, I know.

206
00:09:48,791 --> 00:09:52,041
It is a visitor
from over yonder.

207
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:54,291
I want you to go on
ahead to class.

208
00:09:54,375 --> 00:09:55,750
What are you gonna do?

209
00:09:55,833 --> 00:09:57,500
Finish some business in here.

210
00:09:57,583 --> 00:09:58,875
How so?

211
00:09:58,958 --> 00:09:59,958
Leave.

212
00:10:00,041 --> 00:10:01,291
Get out.

213
00:10:08,625 --> 00:10:10,000
Ami!

214
00:10:10,083 --> 00:10:12,166
The teacher's here already!

215
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:12,666
Kei!

216
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:13,875
Wait for me!

217
00:10:13,958 --> 00:10:15,458
Could you be any slower?

218
00:10:15,541 --> 00:10:17,708
You and Nanami are the only
ones who haven't shown up

219
00:10:17,791 --> 00:10:19,041
to class yet.

220
00:10:19,125 --> 00:10:20,333
Was she in the locker room
with you while you were

221
00:10:20,416 --> 00:10:22,166
taking like forever?

222
00:10:23,833 --> 00:10:25,041
Still is.

223
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:27,000
Go on without me!

224
00:10:27,083 --> 00:10:28,750
Ami?

225
00:10:28,833 --> 00:10:30,916
I like this place a lot.

226
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,625
So many girls come in here and
just take off their clothes.

227
00:10:34,708 --> 00:10:38,708
All I did was watch; technically
I didn't do anything wrong.

228
00:10:38,791 --> 00:10:40,500
Surely you understand.

229
00:10:40,583 --> 00:10:42,541
Surely you won't burn me!

230
00:10:42,625 --> 00:10:44,916
A perverted low-level yokai.

231
00:10:46,125 --> 00:10:48,750
Nothing that should merit
my personal attention;

232
00:10:48,833 --> 00:10:50,500
however for Nanami.

233
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:54,375
I must eliminate all
future problems when I can.

234
00:10:54,458 --> 00:10:55,958
What a bother.

235
00:10:56,041 --> 00:10:57,500
Nanami wait!

236
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:00,708
 I lick!

237
00:11:00,791 --> 00:11:02,000
Why do you have no flavor!

238
00:11:02,083 --> 00:11:03,916
You are not tasty!

239
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:04,958
Hold it!

240
00:11:05,041 --> 00:11:06,500
I hate the tasteless!

241
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:08,666
Hello, Strawberry Flavor!

242
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:09,833
I lick!

243
00:11:12,708 --> 00:11:14,208
That's enough.

244
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:16,916
Wow, Kurama; it's you!

245
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,750
I thought that I told you to
stay away from dark places.

246
00:11:19,833 --> 00:11:20,791
Nanami.

247
00:11:20,875 --> 00:11:22,166
It hurts; it hurts.

248
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:23,375
Kurama!

249
00:11:23,458 --> 00:11:26,208
Take that child and
go outside immediately!

250
00:11:31,041 --> 00:11:33,708
Uh, so do you have any
idea what that thing is?

251
00:11:33,791 --> 00:11:36,625
Don't worry about it; you should
really just get back to class.

252
00:11:36,708 --> 00:11:38,750
Yeah, but Nanami is in there!

253
00:11:43,708 --> 00:11:45,000
Will you do me a favor?

254
00:11:45,083 --> 00:11:47,208
Can what happened
today be a secret?

255
00:11:47,291 --> 00:11:49,125
Promise me you
won't tell anyone?

256
00:11:52,666 --> 00:11:54,083
Kay.

257
00:11:57,291 --> 00:11:58,416
Coming in.

258
00:12:00,208 --> 00:12:01,958
What happened to that yokai?

259
00:12:02,041 --> 00:12:03,500
Did you let it go?

260
00:12:05,875 --> 00:12:07,750
Yes, of course you did.

261
00:12:07,833 --> 00:12:09,500
I guess that's fine.

262
00:12:09,583 --> 00:12:11,083
But be careful.

263
00:12:11,166 --> 00:12:14,791
Unlike the fox, I can't always
be by your side to protect you.

264
00:12:14,875 --> 00:12:17,333
Don't do anything reckless.

265
00:12:17,416 --> 00:12:19,166
Not without him near.

266
00:12:23,041 --> 00:12:25,625
Then starting tomorrow,
I must be sure to have Tomoe

267
00:12:25,708 --> 00:12:27,000
come with me.

268
00:12:29,375 --> 00:12:30,750
You want this?

269
00:12:32,375 --> 00:12:33,333
Don't worry!

270
00:12:33,416 --> 00:12:35,458
The next part
is coming right up!

271
00:12:38,166 --> 00:12:40,666
This is a soft shell turtle
that we caught recently!

272
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:43,750
Partaking of soft shell turtle
stew is sure to cure Lady Nanami

273
00:12:43,833 --> 00:12:45,166
of her nasty cold!

274
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:46,583
Nanami, do you honestly mean

275
00:12:46,666 --> 00:12:48,458
to tell me you've
been eating turtles?

276
00:12:48,541 --> 00:12:51,541
I wonder why Tomoe has you
on such a bizarre diet.

277
00:12:51,625 --> 00:12:53,000
And I wonder.

278
00:12:53,083 --> 00:12:56,375
Hey, what are you doing in
our kitchen anyway, Mizuki?

279
00:12:56,458 --> 00:12:57,791
What?

280
00:12:57,875 --> 00:12:59,750
I heard a rumor Tomoe wasn't
going to be here today.

281
00:12:59,833 --> 00:13:01,750
So I decided to come see you.

282
00:13:01,833 --> 00:13:03,291
Then, your shrine
fellows spirits asked me

283
00:13:03,375 --> 00:13:05,000
to make you lunch.

284
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,375
That hurts!

285
00:13:07,458 --> 00:13:08,958
Oh, the soft shell turtle
bit Master Mizuki's finger!

286
00:13:09,041 --> 00:13:10,916
We must get water!

287
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,875
While Tomoe was at
school disguised as Nanami.

288
00:13:14,958 --> 00:13:17,458
Mizuki, the familiar
of the Yonomori Shrine,

289
00:13:17,541 --> 00:13:19,375
was visiting Nanami.

290
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:21,916
Really?!

291
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,583
Tomoe crossed-dressed as
you and went to school?!

292
00:13:24,666 --> 00:13:26,208
Right now, I'm more
concerned about the turtle,

293
00:13:26,291 --> 00:13:28,250
put him in that boiling
water and you will die!

294
00:13:29,333 --> 00:13:33,166
I guess your Sacred Word
Binding must be very powerful.

295
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:34,875
It's not like I ordered him.

296
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:37,500
I just asked him to go,
and he went.

297
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:40,291
You asked him, did you?

298
00:13:40,375 --> 00:13:41,500
Tomoe must be
putting on quite

299
00:13:41,583 --> 00:13:45,208
the innocent familiar
act around you.

300
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:46,541
What does that mean?

301
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:49,250
Well he was a wild
fox to begin with.

302
00:13:49,333 --> 00:13:52,833
So as his mistress, you need
to lead him with a firm hand.

303
00:13:52,916 --> 00:13:54,250
Mizuki.

304
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:57,541
I don't appreciate you
talking about Tomoe like that.

305
00:13:59,708 --> 00:14:01,291
He doesn't
deserve to be judged,

306
00:14:01,375 --> 00:14:03,833
not because of his looks
or where he came from.

307
00:14:03,916 --> 00:14:05,250
You'll just have to believe me.

308
00:14:05,333 --> 00:14:07,916
I spend more time with him,
and I know him the best.

309
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,791
Sure he seems
kind of wild sometimes.

310
00:14:10,875 --> 00:14:13,750
But he does have
a gentle side, too.

311
00:14:13,833 --> 00:14:15,875
Oh, no.

312
00:14:15,958 --> 00:14:19,333
It seems you've been
completely finessed by him.

313
00:14:19,416 --> 00:14:21,833
His abilities are
stronger than I thought.

314
00:14:21,916 --> 00:14:24,416
Familiars are
supposed to serve gods.

315
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,000
But unfortunately you appear

316
00:14:26,083 --> 00:14:28,666
to be the one who
was tamed instead.

317
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:30,500
Trust me, if you
let your guard down,

318
00:14:30,583 --> 00:14:32,500
that beast will
kill you in your sleep.

319
00:14:32,583 --> 00:14:33,333
Trust me!

320
00:14:33,416 --> 00:14:35,708
I say Tomoe isn't like that!

321
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:37,500
Nanami, you are
far too stubborn.

322
00:14:37,583 --> 00:14:38,958
You are!

323
00:14:39,041 --> 00:14:41,625
Perhaps you need to go take
a peek with your own eyes.

324
00:14:41,708 --> 00:14:43,083
See Tomoe.

325
00:14:43,166 --> 00:14:45,000
And his true colors.

326
00:14:48,458 --> 00:14:50,916
Master Mizuki, what kind
of burner is this?

327
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:51,958
Oh.

328
00:14:52,041 --> 00:14:54,791
A time-wending incense burner.

329
00:14:54,875 --> 00:14:59,208
It's a votive object that
transports the soul to the past.

330
00:14:59,291 --> 00:15:03,500
Far in the past, before
you were even born.

331
00:15:03,583 --> 00:15:07,458
There you'll find a Tomoe
you may not even recognize.

332
00:15:14,875 --> 00:15:17,458
How could I not
recognize Tomoe?

333
00:15:24,541 --> 00:15:25,750
Lady Nanami?

334
00:15:25,833 --> 00:15:26,958
She's fine.

335
00:15:27,041 --> 00:15:29,333
She's on her way now.

336
00:15:29,416 --> 00:15:32,041
Off to have fun in
the crevices of time.

337
00:15:33,833 --> 00:15:35,000
Go take a peek.

338
00:15:35,083 --> 00:15:36,875
Far into the past.

339
00:15:36,958 --> 00:15:38,750
Before you were born.

340
00:15:38,833 --> 00:15:41,750
Discover a Tomoe
before he knew you.

341
00:16:01,375 --> 00:16:02,958
Oh, ow.

342
00:16:04,166 --> 00:16:06,625
Like I would ever
not recognize Tomoe.

343
00:16:06,708 --> 00:16:09,791
I swear, I'm gonna
kill Mizuki for this.

344
00:16:09,875 --> 00:16:11,333
Hold on.

345
00:16:11,416 --> 00:16:12,500
That's weird.

346
00:16:12,583 --> 00:16:15,250
When did my hands get so tiny?

347
00:16:15,333 --> 00:16:17,250
And my clothes.

348
00:16:17,333 --> 00:16:18,750
My hair?

349
00:16:18,833 --> 00:16:19,458
No.

350
00:16:19,541 --> 00:16:20,625
But how?!

351
00:16:20,708 --> 00:16:22,416
This is not my body!

352
00:16:24,041 --> 00:16:25,125
Oh yeah!

353
00:16:25,208 --> 00:16:27,750
This has to be the
world inside my dreams.

354
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,208
Someone help.

355
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,500
It hurts.

356
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:36,958
A little boy.

357
00:16:37,833 --> 00:16:38,750
I'm here.

358
00:16:38,833 --> 00:16:40,541
What happened?

359
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:42,125
You can't go back there.

360
00:16:42,208 --> 00:16:44,458
We were attacked by some yokai.

361
00:16:44,541 --> 00:16:46,750
They killed everyone,
in the village.

362
00:16:46,833 --> 00:16:48,333
They killed everyone.

363
00:16:48,416 --> 00:16:49,708
Yokai?

364
00:16:49,791 --> 00:16:51,166
Akura-oh is looking for you;

365
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:53,916
I can't believe he hasn't
caught you already.

366
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,041
I, I ran away
as fast as I could.

367
00:16:58,125 --> 00:17:00,083
That bastard killed them all.

368
00:17:00,166 --> 00:17:01,500
Akura-oh?

369
00:17:01,583 --> 00:17:04,083
A yokai is looking for me?

370
00:17:04,166 --> 00:17:06,250
Is this really a dream?

371
00:17:15,791 --> 00:17:18,708
Lucky for us, this
empty house was nearby.

372
00:17:18,791 --> 00:17:19,583
Goodness.

373
00:17:19,666 --> 00:17:21,291
It's really coming down, huh?

374
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:23,916
At least we'll be dry in here.

375
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,208
I need to treat his injury.

376
00:17:26,291 --> 00:17:29,333
Who would inflict such a
terrible wound on a child?

377
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:33,125
I'm more lucky, I think.

378
00:17:33,208 --> 00:17:35,541
Who'd have guessed you'd just
happen to be out of the village,

379
00:17:35,625 --> 00:17:37,708
working in the fields.

380
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:40,458
Such a fine virgin,
there's no way Lord Akura-oh

381
00:17:40,541 --> 00:17:42,583
would pass over
something like you.

382
00:17:48,166 --> 00:17:50,833
He always takes every prey
of any value away from us,

383
00:17:50,916 --> 00:17:52,000
you know.

384
00:17:52,083 --> 00:17:52,958
A yokai?

385
00:17:53,041 --> 00:17:53,958
This is bad.

386
00:17:54,041 --> 00:17:56,750
Don't worry about
Lord Akura-oh.

387
00:17:56,833 --> 00:17:59,791
I'll devour you long
before he gets here!

388
00:18:00,708 --> 00:18:01,958
Someone help!

389
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:14,208
Lord.

390
00:18:14,291 --> 00:18:15,166
Tomoe.

391
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:16,500
I.

392
00:18:20,291 --> 00:18:22,416
That was foxfire.

393
00:18:24,333 --> 00:18:26,166
Trash always does burn well.

394
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:30,750
My, a village girl?

395
00:18:32,375 --> 00:18:33,875
Tomoe?

396
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:38,083
It is true; you are
quite a fine specimen.

397
00:18:38,166 --> 00:18:40,166
Rather awful hamlet, though.

398
00:18:41,625 --> 00:18:43,083
Tomoe?

399
00:18:49,916 --> 00:18:51,291
Lovely voice.

400
00:18:53,041 --> 00:18:54,083
Cry out.

401
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:55,958
Human.

402
00:18:56,041 --> 00:18:58,125
This isn't him.

403
00:18:58,208 --> 00:19:00,000
This isn't Tomoe!

404
00:19:08,041 --> 00:19:09,416
Tell me.

405
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:11,291
Who are you?

406
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:17,833
Tomoe!

407
00:19:24,166 --> 00:19:25,500
Tomoe.

408
00:19:25,583 --> 00:19:27,375
You disappear on me for what?

409
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:29,416
A rundown shack in the woods?

410
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:30,375
Someone's here.

411
00:19:30,458 --> 00:19:32,166
This is my chance to get away.

412
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:34,125
I have no wish to get wet.

413
00:19:34,208 --> 00:19:36,500
You're not very good company.

414
00:19:36,583 --> 00:19:39,250
I came because I heard
there was a beauty here.

415
00:19:39,333 --> 00:19:42,333
But the village only had
old hags and ugly women.

416
00:19:42,416 --> 00:19:44,958
Even some of those
cows escaped from me.

417
00:19:45,041 --> 00:19:47,791
I suppose she must have
slipped away with them.

418
00:19:47,875 --> 00:19:50,125
You mean a little girl
gave you the slip?

419
00:19:50,208 --> 00:19:51,625
You are losing your touch.

420
00:19:51,708 --> 00:19:53,416
Akura-oh.

421
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:56,708
I don't suppose you've seen
her in the area, have you?

422
00:19:56,791 --> 00:19:58,166
They call her Yukiji.

423
00:19:59,875 --> 00:20:01,250
No.

424
00:20:03,875 --> 00:20:06,375
He was a wild fox
to begin with.

425
00:20:06,458 --> 00:20:08,208
If you let your guard down.

426
00:20:08,291 --> 00:20:09,291
He's wrong.

427
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:11,416
That beast will
kill you in your sleep.

428
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:12,708
He's wrong!

429
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Of course.

430
00:20:22,083 --> 00:20:23,833
This is only a dream.

431
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,833
Nanami.

432
00:20:33,166 --> 00:20:36,291
You were gone for
a terribly long time.

433
00:20:36,375 --> 00:20:37,958
Where am I?

434
00:20:38,041 --> 00:20:39,875
Your home at the shrine.

435
00:20:41,333 --> 00:20:43,916
Lady Nanami, it took you
so very long to awaken.

436
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,291
We were so worried!

437
00:20:45,375 --> 00:20:46,666
I'm exhausted.

438
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:47,833
But wasn't I sleeping?

439
00:20:47,916 --> 00:20:49,375
No.

440
00:20:49,458 --> 00:20:52,291
I sent your soul into the past,
so you were actually awake.

441
00:20:52,375 --> 00:20:54,208
You experienced the
world of the past,

442
00:20:54,291 --> 00:20:56,416
which leads to our present.

443
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:58,333
Did you meet Tomoe, by chance?

444
00:21:03,291 --> 00:21:03,833
No.

445
00:21:03,916 --> 00:21:05,500
I didn't see him.

446
00:21:05,583 --> 00:21:06,708
See whom?

447
00:21:06,791 --> 00:21:08,708
Who were you not able to see?

448
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,708
Why is there a snake
loitering in the shrine?

449
00:21:13,791 --> 00:21:14,958
Hey there, Tomoe!

450
00:21:15,041 --> 00:21:15,958
Welcome home!

451
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:18,250
Did you have
fun at school today?

452
00:21:18,333 --> 00:21:20,416
What the hell
are you doing here?

453
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:22,750
What were you doing to Nanami?

454
00:21:22,833 --> 00:21:23,458
I.

455
00:21:23,541 --> 00:21:24,083
Can't.

456
00:21:24,166 --> 00:21:24,583
Tell.

457
00:21:24,666 --> 00:21:25,583
You.

458
00:21:25,666 --> 00:21:27,041
Get out!

459
00:21:29,416 --> 00:21:30,666
That damn snake!

460
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:32,500
Why did you let him
into the shrine?

461
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:34,291
We had thought to serve
soft shell turtle stew

462
00:21:34,375 --> 00:21:35,541
to Lady Nanami.

463
00:21:35,625 --> 00:21:38,666
What does a turtle stew
have to do with him?!

464
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:40,416
Nanami.

465
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:50,791
Your temperature.

466
00:21:50,875 --> 00:21:52,500
It is still high.

467
00:21:54,458 --> 00:21:57,125
I will make you
something for it.

468
00:21:57,208 --> 00:21:59,208
Stay in bed.

469
00:21:59,291 --> 00:22:01,333
That's the touch I know.

470
00:22:01,416 --> 00:22:04,000
The gentle touch
of Tomoe's hand.

471
00:22:09,125 --> 00:22:10,083
What is wrong?

472
00:22:10,166 --> 00:22:12,041
What did Mizuki do to you?

473
00:22:12,125 --> 00:22:15,208
No, nothing; I just
had a nightmare.

474
00:22:15,291 --> 00:22:17,250
I'll be okay, though.

475
00:22:17,333 --> 00:22:18,583
Thanks Tomoe.

476
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:23,625
I'm so glad the Tomoe
I know is this Tomoe.

477
00:22:27,583 --> 00:22:29,000
More importantly,
how was your day?

478
00:22:29,083 --> 00:22:30,750
Did you have fun at school?

479
00:23:44,166 --> 00:23:46,541
Tomoe is pretty comfortable
with life at school.

480
00:23:46,625 --> 00:23:49,250
After all, he is popular
among the female students.

481
00:23:49,333 --> 00:23:52,000
Even Nanami's heart tends
to race rather quickly.

482
00:23:52,083 --> 00:23:53,166
Now is when
you should work up

483
00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:55,416
the courage to
move forward, lady!

484
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:58,541
Next time, "The God Asks
a Boy Out on a Date."

485
00:23:58,625 --> 00:24:01,291
Wanna maybe go to the
aquarium together?
