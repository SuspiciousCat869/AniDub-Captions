1
00:01:38,875 --> 00:01:40,625
What a shame.

2
00:01:40,708 --> 00:01:42,750
I've been slaving away,
brewing this latest batch

3
00:01:42,833 --> 00:01:45,958
of sacred sake, but Nanami's
too busy hanging out with Tomoe

4
00:01:46,041 --> 00:01:47,625
at school to even try it.

5
00:01:47,708 --> 00:01:49,916
That fox gets to be around
her twenty-four-seven,

6
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,583
and I can't even tag along.

7
00:01:51,666 --> 00:01:53,875
Life as her familiar
is downright unfair.

8
00:01:53,958 --> 00:01:55,458
This is truly excellent!

9
00:01:55,541 --> 00:01:57,958
Your sacred sake is
certainly something else!

10
00:01:58,041 --> 00:01:59,833
Crisp, smooth, and
so full of flavor!

11
00:01:59,916 --> 00:02:02,708
Surely no other shrine has
sacred sake that can compare!

12
00:02:02,791 --> 00:02:05,583
It's my best brew yet but
I can't exactly call it

13
00:02:05,666 --> 00:02:08,083
"sacred" sake until
Nanami drinks it.

14
00:02:08,166 --> 00:02:10,333
Why is it that I'm always stuck
at the shrine with you guys

15
00:02:10,416 --> 00:02:12,458
while Tomoe's allowed
to go to school with her?

16
00:02:12,541 --> 00:02:15,958
It's not like I'm some useless
yokai; I can do stuff, too!

17
00:02:16,041 --> 00:02:18,250
What's it going to take for
Nanami to finally notice

18
00:02:18,333 --> 00:02:19,916
that I exist.

19
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,166
Master Mizuki, you are still
unaccustomed to human society.

20
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:24,541
Perhaps Lady Nanami wishes

21
00:02:24,625 --> 00:02:28,041
to wait until you are better
acquainted with humans.

22
00:02:28,125 --> 00:02:30,916
If you ask me, I think
I'm plenty used to them.

23
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,916
But how do I convince Nanami
to feel the same way?

24
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,708
Well, here is one example.

25
00:02:35,791 --> 00:02:39,250
♪ Gleaming like stars
against the midnight sky

26
00:02:39,333 --> 00:02:41,166
With wings of deceit

27
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:47,250
In the embrace of joyous
rapture, I fall into delirium! ♪

28
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:49,208
If you were accustomed
to humans to this degree,

29
00:02:49,291 --> 00:02:52,208
I doubt Nanami would object.

30
00:02:52,291 --> 00:02:53,625
You have got to be kidding!

31
00:02:53,708 --> 00:02:55,916
Why would so many humans want
to worship that scumbag?

32
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,250
Master Kurama has lived among
and performed in front

33
00:02:58,333 --> 00:03:00,250
of humans for seventeen years.

34
00:03:00,333 --> 00:03:02,583
Lady Nanami herself was once
crazy about him just like

35
00:03:02,666 --> 00:03:03,791
the other human girls.

36
00:03:03,875 --> 00:03:05,208
Say it isn't so!

37
00:03:05,291 --> 00:03:07,583
A Tengu that leaves its
mountain temple doesn't receive

38
00:03:07,666 --> 00:03:11,541
divine favor and as a result
can't cast powerful spells.

39
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:14,458
I wonder what kind of
yokai powers he's using.

40
00:03:14,541 --> 00:03:15,875
Interesting.

41
00:03:15,958 --> 00:03:17,916
Since things are boring
here anyway, I'm gonna go pay

42
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,541
Kurama a little visit
and pick his brain.

43
00:03:21,875 --> 00:03:25,791
If all goes well, Nanami will be
changing her tune in no time!

44
00:03:31,208 --> 00:03:34,333
Behold, Mizuki arrives
at the great metropolis!

45
00:03:34,416 --> 00:03:36,416
A massive concrete jungle!

46
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:39,291
Where you can witness crowds
upon crowds of busy people

47
00:03:39,375 --> 00:03:41,041
going about their day!

48
00:03:42,333 --> 00:03:44,625
This is the city?

49
00:03:44,708 --> 00:03:46,333
I don't remember all
this negative energy

50
00:03:46,416 --> 00:03:48,625
floating around
when I last visited.

51
00:03:48,708 --> 00:03:50,833
Then again,
it has been a while.

52
00:03:50,916 --> 00:03:53,875
I suppose it is not known as the
"demon capital" for nothing.

53
00:03:53,958 --> 00:03:55,250
No matter.

54
00:03:55,333 --> 00:03:58,125
Kurama's supposed to be
at a place called Toranomon.

55
00:03:58,208 --> 00:04:00,250
Is everything all right,
Master Mizuki?

56
00:04:00,333 --> 00:04:01,500
Of course!

57
00:04:01,583 --> 00:04:02,833
It's not like this place
is just crawling with

58
00:04:02,916 --> 00:04:03,875
demons out to get you.

59
00:04:03,958 --> 00:04:05,166
Hello sir!

60
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:07,833
Are you looking for some help?

61
00:04:07,916 --> 00:04:10,791
So you see, dear friend, it was
the will of God that brought us

62
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:12,875
together on this blessed day!

63
00:04:12,958 --> 00:04:16,458
The heavenly Father sent us to
make you happy, oh so happy!

64
00:04:16,541 --> 00:04:18,583
You do want to be happy,
don't you?

65
00:04:18,666 --> 00:04:20,375
This is your path
to finding happiness

66
00:04:20,458 --> 00:04:21,958
for the rest of your days!

67
00:04:22,041 --> 00:04:23,833
With a generous donation
you can take the first step

68
00:04:23,916 --> 00:04:25,291
towards lifelong happiness!

69
00:04:25,375 --> 00:04:26,875
The bigger the donation
the better, as the number

70
00:04:26,958 --> 00:04:29,583
of blessings God infuses into
the sticker is directly related

71
00:04:29,666 --> 00:04:31,083
to how much money you give!

72
00:04:31,166 --> 00:04:32,750
Donate enough and you can even
wipe away all of your sin!

73
00:04:32,833 --> 00:04:33,875
Hallelujah!

74
00:04:33,958 --> 00:04:34,375
Well?

75
00:04:34,458 --> 00:04:35,000
Well?

76
00:04:35,083 --> 00:04:35,875
Do we have a deal?

77
00:04:35,958 --> 00:04:37,041
Do we have a deal?

78
00:04:37,125 --> 00:04:38,083
Do we have a deal?

79
00:04:38,166 --> 00:04:39,083
Do we have a deal?

80
00:04:39,166 --> 00:04:41,375
The demon capital,
without a doubt.

81
00:04:42,875 --> 00:04:44,916
Talk about scary.

82
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,250
Even Isohime wouldn't
be that demanding!

83
00:04:47,333 --> 00:04:50,666
We ended up spending all of the
offering money from the shrine.

84
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:53,416
Now, where is
Toranomon located?

85
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,333
Maybe the local
humans can help me!

86
00:04:55,416 --> 00:04:56,875
Hey you guys, over here!

87
00:04:56,958 --> 00:05:00,250
Would you know where
I could find Toranomon?

88
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:01,541
Who da hell do ya think ya are?

89
00:05:01,625 --> 00:05:03,458
Ya tryin' ta get yourself
shot or somethin?

90
00:05:03,541 --> 00:05:05,000
What do you mean?

91
00:05:05,083 --> 00:05:07,166
Are you threatening me, sir?

92
00:05:10,291 --> 00:05:11,583
A snake!

93
00:05:11,666 --> 00:05:12,625
There's a giant snake
around that boy's shoulders!

94
00:05:12,708 --> 00:05:13,291
Oh no!

95
00:05:13,375 --> 00:05:14,291
Master Mizuki!

96
00:05:14,375 --> 00:05:15,666
Let's get out of here!

97
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:17,208
Hey, come back here!

98
00:05:17,291 --> 00:05:18,708
What's with this place?

99
00:05:18,791 --> 00:05:21,208
Nothing seems to go right;
it's like it's out to get you!

100
00:05:21,291 --> 00:05:23,625
I gotta soldier through
for Nanami's sake.

101
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:29,375
Wait a second,
isn't that Nanami's?

102
00:05:29,458 --> 00:05:30,916
Is this a joke?

103
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,583
A sticker's not gonna cut it,
I only take cold hard cash!

104
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:34,291
What?

105
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:34,833
But that's all I've-- 

106
00:05:34,916 --> 00:05:35,458
Come on.

107
00:05:35,541 --> 00:05:36,500
Cough it up, kid.

108
00:05:36,583 --> 00:05:37,666
If you aren't gonna pay me,

109
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:39,458
then I'm gonna have
to call the police!

110
00:05:40,416 --> 00:05:41,708
Oh, what do I do now?

111
00:05:41,791 --> 00:05:43,083
Hey.

112
00:05:43,166 --> 00:05:45,916
What's a little snake doing
in a big city like this?

113
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,500
Kurama.

114
00:05:47,583 --> 00:05:48,625
At last!

115
00:05:48,708 --> 00:05:50,125
I've found you!

116
00:05:50,208 --> 00:05:52,291
Please give me five thousand
eight hundred and forty yen!

117
00:05:52,375 --> 00:05:54,291
What are you talking about?

118
00:05:54,375 --> 00:05:55,875
You've come an awfully long way.

119
00:05:55,958 --> 00:05:57,291
Running errands for Nanami?

120
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:59,750
Actually, I came
here to see you.

121
00:05:59,833 --> 00:06:00,625
Kurama!

122
00:06:00,708 --> 00:06:02,125
Let's get going!

123
00:06:02,208 --> 00:06:04,208
We've got that television
wrap party happening at six!

124
00:06:04,291 --> 00:06:05,625
You know you can't miss it!

125
00:06:05,708 --> 00:06:07,416
My reputation as your
manager would be ruined

126
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:10,041
if you stood these people up!

127
00:06:10,125 --> 00:06:12,208
Is this a buddy of yours
I haven't met yet?

128
00:06:12,291 --> 00:06:13,250
No.

129
00:06:13,333 --> 00:06:14,833
Yes, I wanted
to pay him a visit.

130
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:17,708
Well then, you should absolutely
come to the wrap party with him!

131
00:06:17,791 --> 00:06:20,041
Oh, these things have
the best food in the world!

132
00:06:20,125 --> 00:06:20,750
Hey, shut it.

133
00:06:20,833 --> 00:06:21,625
Wrap party?

134
00:06:21,708 --> 00:06:23,166
That sounds really fun!

135
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:24,375
Come see for yourself!

136
00:06:24,458 --> 00:06:26,291
Whose manager are you?

137
00:06:34,375 --> 00:06:35,625
Disgusting.

138
00:06:35,708 --> 00:06:37,291
The food wasn't cooked
with your tastes in mind.

139
00:06:37,375 --> 00:06:40,125
So, what is a familiar
from Mikage Shrine doing

140
00:06:40,208 --> 00:06:41,583
so far away from home?

141
00:06:41,666 --> 00:06:43,041
I could ask you the same thing.

142
00:06:43,125 --> 00:06:45,458
Why do you live in
a place like this?

143
00:06:45,541 --> 00:06:47,666
I walked around town
the whole day.

144
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:50,333
The entire city's covered
in this negative aura.

145
00:06:50,416 --> 00:06:52,541
The people are
so mean and cruel.

146
00:06:52,625 --> 00:06:56,125
I can barely breathe here, so I
can't imagine living here, too.

147
00:06:56,208 --> 00:06:58,541
It's just sickening to me.

148
00:06:58,625 --> 00:07:02,166
The cycle of negativity's
just too much for me to handle.

149
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:03,333
Then why come?

150
00:07:03,416 --> 00:07:04,708
I'm just saying.

151
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:07,458
I wouldn't do something
like abandon my own shrine.

152
00:07:07,541 --> 00:07:09,833
Especially not
for this tainted city.

153
00:07:11,583 --> 00:07:14,541
Then run back home
to the shrine already.

154
00:07:14,625 --> 00:07:16,708
You're not cut out
for this place.

155
00:07:19,083 --> 00:07:20,583
Ah, there you are!

156
00:07:20,666 --> 00:07:22,458
You must say hello
to Miss Tayama.

157
00:07:22,541 --> 00:07:24,916
Was the Tengu just
making fun of me?

158
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,750
Master Mizuki,
let us return home.

159
00:07:26,833 --> 00:07:28,125
What drink do ya got there?

160
00:07:28,208 --> 00:07:29,333
Is that carrot juice?

161
00:07:29,416 --> 00:07:30,500
How cute.

162
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:32,708
It tastes like grief
and disappointment.

163
00:07:32,791 --> 00:07:33,916
What about yours?

164
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,916
Right here's my seventh
glass of this stuff.

165
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,208
A toast to when this pansy
finally turns twenty-one!

166
00:07:40,291 --> 00:07:42,166
I know my way around
drinks as well.

167
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:44,750
This is my most recent
brew of sacred sake.

168
00:07:44,833 --> 00:07:47,541
Woah, my bad,
you got a babyface!

169
00:07:47,625 --> 00:07:49,625
Lemme introduce
ya to my friend.

170
00:07:49,708 --> 00:07:52,916
She's a cocktail that looks
delicate but packs a punch!

171
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,333
Down the hatch!

172
00:07:58,375 --> 00:08:00,833
My daughter is
a huge fan of yours.

173
00:08:00,916 --> 00:08:04,416
She'll be so jealous when I let
her know I met Kurama in person.

174
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,291
Mind if I have a closer look?

175
00:08:06,375 --> 00:08:08,791
It's not every day that I have
the honor of being called upon

176
00:08:08,875 --> 00:08:10,875
by a legendary actress.

177
00:08:10,958 --> 00:08:12,083
You flatter me.

178
00:08:12,166 --> 00:08:13,333
Here ma'am!

179
00:08:13,416 --> 00:08:15,208
Excuse me, but here's
the drink ya asked for.

180
00:08:15,291 --> 00:08:16,041
Sorry for the wait!

181
00:08:16,125 --> 00:08:17,666
What is that swill?

182
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:20,500
Can you not see that I am
holding a dessert in my hand?

183
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:23,791
A sugary spirit like that will
do nothing to cleanse my palate!

184
00:08:23,875 --> 00:08:25,875
Couldn't you have grabbed
something more appropriate?

185
00:08:25,958 --> 00:08:27,125
My apologies!

186
00:08:27,208 --> 00:08:28,958
I'll be right back with
somethin' else for ya!

187
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:30,833
And don't you dare
keep me waiting!

188
00:08:30,916 --> 00:08:32,000
Who's that?

189
00:08:32,083 --> 00:08:34,041
One of the worst
assistants I've ever had.

190
00:08:34,125 --> 00:08:36,208
But that's what I get for being
kindhearted to a commoner

191
00:08:36,291 --> 00:08:37,541
from the country.

192
00:08:37,625 --> 00:08:39,500
Her goal is to
become an actress.

193
00:08:39,583 --> 00:08:41,666
Thinking about it
makes me want to laugh!

194
00:08:45,166 --> 00:08:45,833
Home.

195
00:08:45,916 --> 00:08:47,958
I wanna go home.

196
00:08:48,041 --> 00:08:49,833
I feel so bad.

197
00:08:49,916 --> 00:08:52,000
Someone kill me.

198
00:08:58,125 --> 00:08:59,833
Kurama was right.

199
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:07,000
I'm just not cut out
for living amongst humans.

200
00:09:07,083 --> 00:09:07,666
I don't belong

201
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:08,250
here. 

202
00:09:08,333 --> 00:09:10,208
You doin' okay?

203
00:09:10,291 --> 00:09:12,458
Nanami?

204
00:09:12,541 --> 00:09:14,875
You came for me.

205
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:16,166
Oh Nanami.

206
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:17,541
Don't you die here, mister.

207
00:09:17,625 --> 00:09:19,583
You got your whole
life ahead of you!

208
00:09:23,708 --> 00:09:24,458
Who're you?

209
00:09:24,541 --> 00:09:26,416
Where'd Lady Nanami go?

210
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:27,500
Where am I?

211
00:09:27,583 --> 00:09:29,125
Thank goodness
you're finally awake!

212
00:09:29,208 --> 00:09:31,166
We're outside the wrap party.

213
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:32,708
I was headin' to get
a drink for the old bag

214
00:09:32,791 --> 00:09:36,500
when I saw you keeled over,
lookin' all green.

215
00:09:36,583 --> 00:09:39,250
I guess ya had a little
trouble holdin your alcohol.

216
00:09:39,333 --> 00:09:41,375
Would ya like some
cold water, hun?

217
00:09:41,458 --> 00:09:43,916
You were with me
this entire time?

218
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,416
Thank you.

219
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,000
I'm sorry!

220
00:09:48,083 --> 00:09:49,833
I still have some
trouble recognizin'

221
00:09:49,916 --> 00:09:51,625
which famous
celebrities are which!

222
00:09:51,708 --> 00:09:53,958
I just moved here
from the country.

223
00:09:54,041 --> 00:09:56,541
I came to the city wantin'
to become an actress,

224
00:09:56,625 --> 00:09:58,791
but this is my first time
goin' to a fancy party.

225
00:09:58,875 --> 00:10:00,875
I'm just so awkward around
all these big stars

226
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:02,125
that I can't even
think straight.

227
00:10:02,208 --> 00:10:04,375
Everything tonight's
felt like such a blur!

228
00:10:04,458 --> 00:10:07,291
To top things off, I got
to see Kurama in person!

229
00:10:07,375 --> 00:10:09,958
He looked perfect, it's hard
to believe he's even human!

230
00:10:10,041 --> 00:10:11,416
That's because he isn't.

231
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,250
I've been so flustered
that I haven't even had

232
00:10:13,333 --> 00:10:17,250
a normal conversation with
anyone today, 'cept for you.

233
00:10:17,333 --> 00:10:19,625
It's nice to know there's at
least one person in this place

234
00:10:19,708 --> 00:10:21,375
I can talk to.

235
00:10:21,458 --> 00:10:22,958
Thank you for that.

236
00:10:23,041 --> 00:10:25,166
You don't fit in here, either?

237
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:28,333
You shouldn't force yourself
to be somebody you aren't.

238
00:10:28,416 --> 00:10:31,333
I admit that I still haven't
found my way and ya' know

239
00:10:31,416 --> 00:10:33,208
maybe I never will.

240
00:10:33,291 --> 00:10:34,916
But truth is--

241
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,458
I like this city.

242
00:10:36,541 --> 00:10:38,666
I really do.

243
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:42,125
I'll work hard and do
my best to make it here.

244
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:43,541
Listen to me!

245
00:10:43,625 --> 00:10:45,083
Shucks.

246
00:10:48,875 --> 00:10:50,833
Wow.

247
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:53,083
Shoot, I gotta hustle
back inside to the party!

248
00:10:53,166 --> 00:10:54,708
She told me to get her
a drink and here I am

249
00:10:54,791 --> 00:10:56,625
goin' on long tangents!

250
00:10:57,875 --> 00:11:00,458
I get it now.

251
00:11:03,083 --> 00:11:05,666
Well it was nice meetin' you
and chattin' for a bit.

252
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:10,708
I have to start
heading home myself.

253
00:11:10,791 --> 00:11:11,958
Oh my!

254
00:11:13,375 --> 00:11:15,583
Thank you for helping me.

255
00:11:15,666 --> 00:11:18,375
Have this, my sacred sake.

256
00:11:19,958 --> 00:11:21,708
Drink it, and it
cleanses the body.

257
00:11:21,791 --> 00:11:23,666
Serve it, and it will
bring good fortune.

258
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:25,750
It is the sake of gods.

259
00:11:25,833 --> 00:11:28,500
Thank you again for
looking after me tonight.

260
00:11:32,291 --> 00:11:34,500
I've learned this isn't
the right place for me,

261
00:11:34,583 --> 00:11:36,875
and it's not the life I want.

262
00:11:36,958 --> 00:11:39,708
But for others, that
might not be the case.

263
00:11:39,791 --> 00:11:42,500
They don't care what
obstacles get in their way;

264
00:11:42,583 --> 00:11:45,166
they'll go after their
dreams no matter what.

265
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:52,791
They're stronger
than I thought.

266
00:11:52,875 --> 00:11:55,541
And resilient.

267
00:11:55,625 --> 00:11:58,458
It's truly an inspiration.

268
00:12:02,916 --> 00:12:05,333
This aroma takes me back.

269
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:13,000
Please, God, help me
become more like them.

270
00:12:13,083 --> 00:12:15,375
Give me their strength, too.

271
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:22,166
So what did you think,
Master Mizuki?

272
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:24,083
Your first outing.

273
00:12:24,166 --> 00:12:27,833
Right now I've only
got one thing on my mind.

274
00:12:27,916 --> 00:12:30,416
What's Tomoe gonna do to me
once he finds out I spent all

275
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,916
the offering money on a sticker?

276
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:45,625
Nanami's awfully
excited this morning!

277
00:12:45,708 --> 00:12:48,125
Seize the day, girl!

278
00:12:48,208 --> 00:12:51,458
Lady Nanami, where could you be
heading so early in the morning?

279
00:12:51,541 --> 00:12:54,291
Oh, I guess I forgot to
tell you guys last night.

280
00:12:54,375 --> 00:12:56,875
Today, Tomoe and I are
going to ride a Ferris wheel!

281
00:12:56,958 --> 00:12:58,458
Exciting, right?

282
00:12:59,833 --> 00:13:00,958
Without a care in the world,

283
00:13:01,041 --> 00:13:03,500
Nanami is focused
on enjoying the day.

284
00:13:03,583 --> 00:13:06,375
Wake up sleepyhead,
the bus is almost here.

285
00:13:07,958 --> 00:13:09,625
What're you doing still in bed?

286
00:13:09,708 --> 00:13:11,500
You can go alone
if you so desire.

287
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:13,250
But you told me
that you would go!

288
00:13:13,333 --> 00:13:16,208
Hey do you wanna go to
the amusement park and ride

289
00:13:16,291 --> 00:13:18,500
the Ferris wheel this weekend?

290
00:13:20,208 --> 00:13:21,166
She lied.

291
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:22,791
Geez, you're such a moron!

292
00:13:22,875 --> 00:13:24,291
And after I dressed up
for the occasion!

293
00:13:24,375 --> 00:13:25,375
I'm gonna ransack your room

294
00:13:25,458 --> 00:13:27,416
and find all of
your dirty magazines.

295
00:13:30,958 --> 00:13:32,083
A hair stick?

296
00:13:32,166 --> 00:13:33,583
How pretty.

297
00:13:33,666 --> 00:13:34,708
That's weird.

298
00:13:34,791 --> 00:13:35,791
Why would you have
a woman's hair stick

299
00:13:35,875 --> 00:13:38,208
just lying around in your room?

300
00:13:38,291 --> 00:13:40,666
It is really none
of your business.

301
00:13:45,083 --> 00:13:47,125
Hair stick.

302
00:13:47,208 --> 00:13:49,208
Who does it belong to?

303
00:13:49,291 --> 00:13:51,250
Shall we go to the park now?

304
00:13:51,333 --> 00:13:53,250
And here we are,
at the amusement park.

305
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:55,125
The second half of this
episode will take place

306
00:13:55,208 --> 00:13:57,333
at everyone's
favorite dating spot!

307
00:13:58,333 --> 00:13:59,208
Finally!

308
00:13:59,291 --> 00:14:01,458
I haven't been here in forever!

309
00:14:01,541 --> 00:14:04,250
Is that the
so-called Ferris wheel?

310
00:14:04,333 --> 00:14:05,791
I do not understand the appeal.

311
00:14:05,875 --> 00:14:07,125
All it does is spin.

312
00:14:07,208 --> 00:14:09,166
So, about that hair stick
that was in your room.

313
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:11,541
I could spin for hours
on that giant circle!

314
00:14:11,625 --> 00:14:13,583
I say we head over
to it right now?

315
00:14:13,666 --> 00:14:15,750
Why is he acting all strange?

316
00:14:15,833 --> 00:14:18,291
That stick has to
mean something to him.

317
00:14:18,375 --> 00:14:20,083
Otherwise, why have it at all?

318
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:28,875
I'm going to stop
worrying about it.

319
00:14:28,958 --> 00:14:31,291
I just gotta sit back
and let in the funshine!

320
00:14:31,375 --> 00:14:33,125
There're three things
on today's agenda,

321
00:14:33,208 --> 00:14:35,250
fun at the amusement park,
dinner during sunset,

322
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:37,208
and the grand finale,
enjoying the night view

323
00:14:37,291 --> 00:14:38,666
from atop the Ferris wheel.

324
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:39,833
Why?

325
00:14:39,916 --> 00:14:40,625
We could ride the
Ferris wheel right now

326
00:14:40,708 --> 00:14:41,916
and get it out of the way.

327
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:42,958
Nope!

328
00:14:43,041 --> 00:14:43,791
The Ferris wheel
is meant for night;

329
00:14:43,875 --> 00:14:45,625
it's more romantic that way.

330
00:14:45,708 --> 00:14:47,250
Um, excuse me.

331
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:51,708
Do you mind if I snap
a quick picture of you?

332
00:14:51,791 --> 00:14:53,458
Also, can I post it to my blog?

333
00:14:53,541 --> 00:14:55,708
Gosh he's hot!

334
00:14:55,791 --> 00:14:58,291
Never mind about that, miss.

335
00:14:58,375 --> 00:15:00,625
Your hat is slightly off-center.

336
00:15:01,583 --> 00:15:04,916
Doesn't he know it's supposed
to be worn like that?

337
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:05,958
What!

338
00:15:06,041 --> 00:15:07,000
No thank you so
much for fixing it!

339
00:15:07,083 --> 00:15:08,125
How could I be so clumsy?

340
00:15:08,208 --> 00:15:09,125
Thanks again!

341
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:10,875
I am happy to be
of service to you.

342
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:13,708
I bet you're "happy to be
of service", you big jerk!

343
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,250
I do not see what
the fuss is about.

344
00:15:19,333 --> 00:15:21,416
So I touched a human woman.

345
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:24,708
As I have already stated,
all human girls, including you,

346
00:15:24,791 --> 00:15:27,416
are of little interest to me.

347
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:28,625
Whatever, do what you want.

348
00:15:28,708 --> 00:15:30,208
I couldn't care less
about what you think.

349
00:15:30,291 --> 00:15:31,916
Nothing you say can faze me.

350
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Even if you told me
you were into a human girl

351
00:15:34,083 --> 00:15:35,791
hundreds of years ago.

352
00:15:37,666 --> 00:15:39,125
Aw crap, you idiot!

353
00:15:39,208 --> 00:15:41,833
So much for never
bringing that up to him.

354
00:15:41,916 --> 00:15:42,666
What was that?

355
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:44,000
What?

356
00:15:44,083 --> 00:15:46,291
I believe I just heard
humans screaming in agony.

357
00:15:46,375 --> 00:15:47,750
Humans screaming?

358
00:15:53,916 --> 00:15:55,750
What is that contraption?

359
00:15:55,833 --> 00:15:57,541
Uh, that's called
a roller coaster.

360
00:15:57,625 --> 00:16:00,250
Only crazy people like
to ride that kind of stuff.

361
00:16:00,333 --> 00:16:03,083
May I direct your attention
to the merry-go-round?

362
00:16:03,166 --> 00:16:04,583
Fascinating!

363
00:16:04,666 --> 00:16:05,541
It looks like fun!

364
00:16:05,625 --> 00:16:07,291
Wouldn't you agree?

365
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,958
Oh my god!

366
00:16:13,041 --> 00:16:13,458
Let me off!

367
00:16:13,541 --> 00:16:14,166
I hate you!

368
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:15,708
Why did I agree to this?

369
00:16:17,666 --> 00:16:18,958
Open your eyes, Nanami!

370
00:16:19,041 --> 00:16:19,666
Look ahead!

371
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:20,916
No way!

372
00:16:31,166 --> 00:16:32,583
He's laughing.

373
00:16:32,666 --> 00:16:35,041
I've never seen him
like that before.

374
00:16:35,125 --> 00:16:36,708
I can't believe it!

375
00:16:36,791 --> 00:16:38,500
He's actually happy.

376
00:16:41,666 --> 00:16:44,666
It makes me happy, too!

377
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:47,250
It's almost as if
we're on a real date.

378
00:16:48,458 --> 00:16:50,125
Nanami.

379
00:16:50,208 --> 00:16:51,916
Your hair is in disarray.

380
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:52,625
What?

381
00:16:52,708 --> 00:16:54,000
Oh no, please look away!

382
00:16:54,083 --> 00:16:56,708
The wind appears to have
blown it all over the place.

383
00:16:56,791 --> 00:16:59,541
Do you mind if
I fix it for you?

384
00:17:03,791 --> 00:17:05,291
Sit still, please.

385
00:17:07,625 --> 00:17:08,500
Seriously?

386
00:17:08,583 --> 00:17:10,250
How did you even do that?

387
00:17:10,333 --> 00:17:13,208
It took you no time at all, but
you didn't use pins or anything!

388
00:17:13,291 --> 00:17:14,625
I did use a hair stick.

389
00:17:14,708 --> 00:17:15,791
What?

390
00:17:15,875 --> 00:17:16,666
Just one.

391
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:18,500
And it looks perfect.

392
00:17:20,208 --> 00:17:21,916
I'm in heaven.

393
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:27,125
Tea and some nuggets, please.

394
00:17:27,208 --> 00:17:29,125
Hey, aren't you the girl
with the boyfriend who

395
00:17:29,208 --> 00:17:31,208
wears a kimono?

396
00:17:31,291 --> 00:17:33,458
Today the park is buzzing
about the cute boy

397
00:17:33,541 --> 00:17:36,291
wearing traditional clothing.

398
00:17:36,375 --> 00:17:38,708
Here's an extra toothpick
so you two can share.

399
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:39,916
Um, thanks.

400
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,833
But we're actually
not dating or anything.

401
00:17:41,916 --> 00:17:42,625
Ah, really?

402
00:17:42,708 --> 00:17:44,083
That's too bad.

403
00:17:44,166 --> 00:17:47,625
But I am hoping that things
will turn out that way!

404
00:17:50,166 --> 00:17:51,625
Wouldn't that be nice?

405
00:17:51,708 --> 00:17:53,875
One day, I just know
he'll come around.

406
00:18:04,791 --> 00:18:06,500
She stumbled and I
helped her to her feet.

407
00:18:06,583 --> 00:18:07,333
That is all.

408
00:18:07,416 --> 00:18:08,625
And you fondled her hair.

409
00:18:08,708 --> 00:18:10,916
It became disheveled
when she fell down.

410
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,291
So I touched a human woman.

411
00:18:12,375 --> 00:18:14,666
As I have already
stated multiple times.

412
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:17,958
All human girls, including you,
are of little interest to me.

413
00:18:18,041 --> 00:18:18,791
You're lying.

414
00:18:18,875 --> 00:18:21,083
Don't say it!

415
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:24,666
You did have feelings
for a human way back when!

416
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:26,000
What did you say?

417
00:18:26,083 --> 00:18:27,916
You used to love
a woman named Yukiji.

418
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:28,791
Don't deny it.

419
00:18:28,875 --> 00:18:30,458
I can't stop myself.

420
00:18:30,541 --> 00:18:32,250
For all I know, that
hair stick in your room

421
00:18:32,333 --> 00:18:34,166
was probably hers, too.

422
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:35,708
What are you going on about?

423
00:18:35,791 --> 00:18:37,625
I know of no such woman.

424
00:18:37,708 --> 00:18:40,291
Wherever did you hear
such far-fetched stories?

425
00:18:40,375 --> 00:18:42,916
Better yet, which roller
coaster should we ride next?

426
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,708
You don't have to talk about
her if you don't want to.

427
00:18:47,791 --> 00:18:49,500
But--

428
00:18:49,583 --> 00:18:51,041
Don't lie to me!

429
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,208
What a jerk!

430
00:18:54,291 --> 00:18:55,625
Playing dumb like that!

431
00:18:55,708 --> 00:18:56,791
If I hadn't seen it for myself,

432
00:18:56,875 --> 00:18:59,416
then I'd believe
every word he said.

433
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:01,083
But it doesn't really matter.

434
00:19:01,166 --> 00:19:03,291
He loved her long
before I was even born.

435
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:06,708
So why's he pretending
it didn't happen?

436
00:19:06,791 --> 00:19:09,375
Are there other lies
he's hiding from me, too?

437
00:19:26,541 --> 00:19:29,291
I wonder when he can't
keep throwing me the

438
00:19:29,375 --> 00:19:32,666
"no, I can't love you because
you're human" line anymore.

439
00:19:35,833 --> 00:19:38,541
What other excuses
will he come up with?

440
00:19:45,833 --> 00:19:47,708
Tomoe.

441
00:19:47,791 --> 00:19:50,125
Maybe he got mad and went home.

442
00:19:50,208 --> 00:19:51,708
I wouldn't blame him.

443
00:19:55,833 --> 00:19:58,458
I should probably start
heading back, too.

444
00:20:05,666 --> 00:20:08,916
Maybe I'll be able to
spot him from up there.

445
00:20:13,208 --> 00:20:15,166
The park's so beautiful.

446
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:17,250
Everything's beautiful at night.

447
00:20:21,958 --> 00:20:23,541
But as pretty as it is,

448
00:20:23,625 --> 00:20:25,750
it's just not the same
when you're alone.

449
00:20:28,916 --> 00:20:30,291
I'm so stupid.

450
00:20:30,375 --> 00:20:32,875
We were supposed to ride
the Ferris wheel together,

451
00:20:32,958 --> 00:20:36,083
but I threw a fit,
like some spoiled brat.

452
00:20:39,708 --> 00:20:41,333
Those lights.

453
00:20:41,416 --> 00:20:44,166
They're from that roller
coaster we rode earlier today.

454
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:52,916
Why did I have to go
and ruin everything?

455
00:20:55,583 --> 00:20:56,791
Tomoe's hairdo.

456
00:20:56,875 --> 00:20:58,208
It came undone!

457
00:21:05,333 --> 00:21:07,458
I did use a hair stick.

458
00:21:07,541 --> 00:21:09,500
And it looks perfect.

459
00:21:12,541 --> 00:21:15,583
I have finally found you.

460
00:21:15,666 --> 00:21:17,041
Tomoe?

461
00:21:20,875 --> 00:21:23,916
I'm sorry about everything
that happened earlier.

462
00:21:30,208 --> 00:21:31,708
Is this the wheel you
wanted to ride with me?

463
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:33,291
Um, yes!

464
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:34,708
You must be happy
you got to ride it.

465
00:21:34,791 --> 00:21:36,041
Yeah.

466
00:21:36,125 --> 00:21:37,750
So then smile.

467
00:21:37,833 --> 00:21:39,583
Like you did earlier.

468
00:21:45,833 --> 00:21:48,291
So, um, this hair stick.

469
00:21:48,375 --> 00:21:49,833
I bought it over yonder.

470
00:21:49,916 --> 00:21:51,000
You did?

471
00:21:51,083 --> 00:21:52,500
I did.

472
00:21:52,583 --> 00:21:54,250
Truthfully, it did not seem
like you would ever use it,

473
00:21:54,333 --> 00:21:57,208
so I put it away.

474
00:21:57,291 --> 00:22:01,000
After all, it is rare
that you put your hair up.

475
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:09,166
In that moment.

476
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:13,541
I felt more love for him
than I ever had before.

477
00:22:13,625 --> 00:22:16,500
I hated the Ferris wheel
for continuing to turn.

478
00:22:19,625 --> 00:22:21,750
Tomoe, thank you.

479
00:22:24,375 --> 00:22:26,375
I will never forget this.

480
00:22:26,458 --> 00:22:29,250
The night I realized
he loved me back.

481
00:22:29,333 --> 00:22:32,958
Nothing in the world could make
me happier than I am right now.

482
00:23:45,333 --> 00:23:48,041
Mikage Shrine's worshippers
are dwindling by the day.

483
00:23:48,125 --> 00:23:49,708
Local residents
won't stop gossiping,

484
00:23:49,791 --> 00:23:51,500
calling the place
"spooky" and "beat-up".

485
00:23:51,583 --> 00:23:52,583
Rude.

486
00:23:52,666 --> 00:23:53,791
But our Nanami
won't have any of it!

487
00:23:53,875 --> 00:23:55,291
In fact, she's putting
on a grand festival

488
00:23:55,375 --> 00:23:56,458
to drum up business!

489
00:23:56,541 --> 00:23:57,916
What an entrepreneur!

490
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,125
Next time, "Nanami
Quits Being A God".

491
00:24:00,208 --> 00:24:01,458
Wait, that sounds terrible!
