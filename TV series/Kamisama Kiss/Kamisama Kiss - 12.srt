1
00:01:39,333 --> 00:01:40,958
What a beautiful day it is!

2
00:01:41,041 --> 00:01:42,833
And here she comes
skipping merrily into town

3
00:01:42,916 --> 00:01:44,166
to do a little shopping!

4
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:45,416
How fun!

5
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:46,958
Okay so I'm gonna
need some toothpaste,

6
00:01:47,041 --> 00:01:48,791
cleaning sponges
and some packing tape.

7
00:01:48,875 --> 00:01:49,333
Easy.

8
00:01:49,416 --> 00:01:49,958
Shut up!

9
00:01:50,041 --> 00:01:50,916
Someone's coming!

10
00:01:54,416 --> 00:01:55,541
It's the ghost!

11
00:01:55,625 --> 00:01:56,000
Hurry!

12
00:01:56,083 --> 00:01:57,500
Go!

13
00:01:59,458 --> 00:02:00,250
Dumb kids!

14
00:02:00,333 --> 00:02:01,416
How rude.

15
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:02,625
No kidding.

16
00:02:02,708 --> 00:02:05,208
Other people's children
can be total jerks.

17
00:02:11,708 --> 00:02:13,416
Have you heard about
that old run-down shrine

18
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,083
on top of the mountain?

19
00:02:15,166 --> 00:02:16,625
You mean the one
they said is haunted?

20
00:02:16,708 --> 00:02:17,791
Of course I have!

21
00:02:17,875 --> 00:02:20,208
I'm getting chills
just thinking about it!

22
00:02:20,291 --> 00:02:21,625
People have been saying
they've seen the ghost

23
00:02:21,708 --> 00:02:23,250
of a young girl up there lately.

24
00:02:23,333 --> 00:02:24,458
You mean like a new one?

25
00:02:24,541 --> 00:02:24,958
Yes.

26
00:02:25,041 --> 00:02:26,250
It's so sad.

27
00:02:26,333 --> 00:02:28,166
So I've been telling
the kids to stay far away.

28
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:31,125
I mean, who knows what
happened to that poor girl!

29
00:02:31,208 --> 00:02:32,500
You're wrong.

30
00:02:32,583 --> 00:02:35,125
It's not like some kind
of creepy haunted movie set!

31
00:02:35,208 --> 00:02:37,583
It's just in a weird place so
everyone freaks out about that.

32
00:02:37,666 --> 00:02:39,541
But Tomoe keeps everything
clean and comfortable!

33
00:02:39,625 --> 00:02:40,875
So not run-down at all!

34
00:02:40,958 --> 00:02:41,375
Oh.

35
00:02:41,458 --> 00:02:42,000
I see.

36
00:02:42,083 --> 00:02:42,583
How enlightening.

37
00:02:42,666 --> 00:02:44,125
Tomo-wha?

38
00:02:44,208 --> 00:02:45,791
I'm sure it's fine, dear.

39
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:49,666
They thought it was
abandoned and haunted?

40
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:51,541
I don't think it
looks run-down at all.

41
00:02:51,625 --> 00:02:53,708
Well no wonder they
haven't had any visitors!

42
00:02:53,791 --> 00:02:56,000
Who wants to hang out at
a shrine full of ghosts?

43
00:02:56,083 --> 00:02:57,541
Poor precious lambs.

44
00:03:07,583 --> 00:03:09,500
What is the matter, Nanami?

45
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:12,208
Um, nothing.

46
00:03:12,291 --> 00:03:15,083
What happened to the lovely day
of shopping you had planned?

47
00:03:16,666 --> 00:03:17,541
I got distracted.

48
00:03:17,625 --> 00:03:18,750
What are you doing up there?

49
00:03:18,833 --> 00:03:20,083
Well.

50
00:03:20,166 --> 00:03:22,416
The branches have started
to encroach on the gate.

51
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:25,333
I was pondering whether or
not I should cut them down.

52
00:03:33,583 --> 00:03:35,208
I have to fix this.

53
00:03:37,375 --> 00:03:38,625
I know!

54
00:03:38,708 --> 00:03:41,125
An autumn festival
at the Mikage Shrine!

55
00:03:41,208 --> 00:03:43,083
We'll invite everyone and when
they get here they'll know

56
00:03:43,166 --> 00:03:47,083
for sure that it isn't some
creepy run-down ghost town!

57
00:03:47,166 --> 00:03:47,833
Yay!

58
00:03:47,916 --> 00:03:48,708
Fun!

59
00:03:48,791 --> 00:03:50,083
Count me in!

60
00:03:50,166 --> 00:03:51,791
Ridiculous.

61
00:03:51,875 --> 00:03:54,625
A sacred ritual is not
an excuse for a party.

62
00:03:54,708 --> 00:03:56,250
I will have nothing
to do with it.

63
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
This brings back fond memories!

64
00:04:00,083 --> 00:04:03,083
We used to host many sacred
rituals back in the day.

65
00:04:04,291 --> 00:04:05,791
It's a little messy.

66
00:04:05,875 --> 00:04:10,208
Lord Mikage has requested that
we not touch anything inside!

67
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:10,916
Look!

68
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,208
It's a sacred palanquin!

69
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:16,958
Oh no!

70
00:04:17,833 --> 00:04:19,041
What is that?

71
00:04:19,125 --> 00:04:20,125
Lady Nanami!

72
00:04:20,208 --> 00:04:21,541
You should not
allow things to fall!

73
00:04:21,625 --> 00:04:22,583
Sorry!

74
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:26,375
Yay!

75
00:04:26,458 --> 00:04:27,583
Let's see how it looks!

76
00:04:33,791 --> 00:04:34,708
It's really not that bad!

77
00:04:34,791 --> 00:04:36,041
We can make it work!

78
00:04:37,666 --> 00:04:38,791
This will be easy.

79
00:04:38,875 --> 00:04:40,541
It just needs some paint!

80
00:04:40,625 --> 00:04:42,083
And maybe some soap.

81
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:53,500
I cannot believe
she pulled that out.

82
00:04:53,583 --> 00:04:54,458
What is wrong with that girl?

83
00:04:54,541 --> 00:04:55,416
Is she insane?

84
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:56,666
Look at her!

85
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:58,750
I was wondering the same
thing about you, Tomoe.

86
00:04:58,833 --> 00:05:01,333
You know, if you're concerned,
you could go help her.

87
00:05:01,416 --> 00:05:02,625
Or maybe not?

88
00:05:02,708 --> 00:05:04,916
It's amazing to me how
you refuse to see Nanami

89
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,833
as anything more than a
helpless human girl because

90
00:05:07,916 --> 00:05:10,708
when I look at her, I don't
see anything less than a god.

91
00:05:12,666 --> 00:05:15,666
She is the only one who
sees herself as a human.

92
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:17,416
It is all she will accept.

93
00:05:20,041 --> 00:05:21,500
Starting to look good!

94
00:05:21,583 --> 00:05:22,958
I hardly recognize it!

95
00:05:23,041 --> 00:05:25,041
You have been
working hard out here.

96
00:05:27,833 --> 00:05:28,750
Hi, Tomoe!

97
00:05:28,833 --> 00:05:29,375
Look!

98
00:05:29,458 --> 00:05:30,791
It's my palanquin!

99
00:05:35,166 --> 00:05:37,083
Sacred palanquins are for gods.

100
00:05:37,166 --> 00:05:39,291
As a human, you cannot ride it.

101
00:05:43,416 --> 00:05:45,750
Sacred rituals are too big
of a burden for you.

102
00:05:45,833 --> 00:05:47,916
Save yourself the trouble
and let this go.

103
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,666
I'm not giving up!

104
00:05:52,166 --> 00:05:54,708
We can set the
palanquin aside for now.

105
00:05:54,791 --> 00:05:56,541
I wonder what else is in here.

106
00:05:56,625 --> 00:05:58,500
Surely there's
something we can use.

107
00:06:06,791 --> 00:06:08,208
It really is quite amazing.

108
00:06:08,291 --> 00:06:10,000
You never know when to stop.

109
00:06:10,083 --> 00:06:12,916
Having a lack of worshippers
is not a recent occurrence.

110
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,625
This shrine has
been in this exact state

111
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:17,166
long before you came.

112
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:18,458
Just because you
are the land god

113
00:06:18,541 --> 00:06:21,375
does not mean you
are held responsible.

114
00:06:22,958 --> 00:06:26,500
I know, but you always work
so hard to keep it clean.

115
00:06:26,583 --> 00:06:28,791
I want others to appreciate it.

116
00:06:34,083 --> 00:06:37,250
I've never seen a shrine
so perfectly spotless.

117
00:06:37,333 --> 00:06:40,958
We never even find trash
in the offering boxes.

118
00:06:41,041 --> 00:06:44,958
It's beautiful and I want
everyone to know about it.

119
00:06:47,125 --> 00:06:49,416
I know if I were a better god
I could do something magical

120
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:50,833
to get them all here.

121
00:06:50,916 --> 00:06:53,333
But I'm not so, I'm just
gonna have to be the human...

122
00:06:53,416 --> 00:06:55,125
You are the only one
who sees it that way.

123
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:01,208
It is because of your presence
here that the air appears clear.

124
00:07:01,291 --> 00:07:03,750
Uninhabited shrines tend
to attract negative energy

125
00:07:03,833 --> 00:07:06,333
as well as a strong
miasma into the air.

126
00:07:06,416 --> 00:07:09,250
Even I would be incapable
of exorcising it.

127
00:07:09,333 --> 00:07:11,125
Think back to when
you first arrived.

128
00:07:14,291 --> 00:07:16,375
The place has become
considerably more beautiful,

129
00:07:16,458 --> 00:07:17,625
has it not?

130
00:07:20,625 --> 00:07:21,791
I can see that.

131
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:23,166
But I still don't want
people around town

132
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:25,083
talking about it like a shack.

133
00:07:25,166 --> 00:07:26,458
It's done!

134
00:07:26,541 --> 00:07:27,541
Yes!

135
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,083
The Mikage Shrine,
we're holding a festival.

136
00:07:32,166 --> 00:07:33,625
Please come, sir!

137
00:07:36,583 --> 00:07:38,000
Here, take one!

138
00:07:40,291 --> 00:07:41,416
No way!

139
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:42,833
People that go there
are turned into ghosts!

140
00:07:42,916 --> 00:07:43,791
Not true.

141
00:07:43,875 --> 00:07:44,500
It's beautiful.

142
00:07:44,583 --> 00:07:45,791
Come see for yourself!

143
00:07:47,666 --> 00:07:48,666
Gotta go!

144
00:07:49,583 --> 00:07:50,666
Hope you can make it!

145
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:52,958
Looking forward to seeing you!

146
00:07:53,041 --> 00:07:54,750
Hosted by a human girl?

147
00:07:54,833 --> 00:07:57,291
Well isn't that
just loads of fun?

148
00:07:59,416 --> 00:08:00,416
Okay everyone!

149
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,500
The festival
is only a week away.

150
00:08:02,583 --> 00:08:04,750
We need to figure out what
kind of events we want to have.

151
00:08:04,833 --> 00:08:07,208
I'm open to any suggestions
you'd like to make!

152
00:08:07,291 --> 00:08:07,708
Oh!

153
00:08:07,791 --> 00:08:08,750
I have one!

154
00:08:10,875 --> 00:08:14,208
I'd like to prepare giant urns
of sake to serve to our guests.

155
00:08:14,291 --> 00:08:16,166
Enough so that we never run out!

156
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:20,291
Where do you hope to
find that much sake?

157
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:22,500
My idea is being criticized
by the fox who hasn't even

158
00:08:22,583 --> 00:08:24,083
bothered to make
a suggestion, yet?

159
00:08:24,166 --> 00:08:25,166
Good point.

160
00:08:27,375 --> 00:08:28,666
Why not capture a few yokai

161
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:31,458
and then provide educational
lectures on each one?

162
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:36,666
There's no way we'll
ever agree on this.

163
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:38,125
They're from a different world.

164
00:08:38,208 --> 00:08:39,458
I have to think!

165
00:08:44,916 --> 00:08:47,000
If you're thinking about
providing food for guests,

166
00:08:47,083 --> 00:08:49,250
that will require a permit
from the Health Department.

167
00:08:49,333 --> 00:08:51,791
A sacred kagura dance
is always sure to be a hit.

168
00:08:51,875 --> 00:08:55,166
Let's see-- have
someone tell fortunes.

169
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:56,125
A kagura dance!

170
00:08:56,208 --> 00:08:57,541
Tell fortunes!

171
00:08:57,625 --> 00:09:00,291
Those ideas are
perfect Kurama, thank you!

172
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:04,916
What is happening
and why are you here?

173
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,458
Nanami sent me an invitation.

174
00:09:07,541 --> 00:09:08,833
She was worried
about planning events

175
00:09:08,916 --> 00:09:11,000
with a useless fox
and his friends.

176
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:11,916
Here you go.

177
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,333
I brought you a gift.

178
00:09:13,416 --> 00:09:14,208
Yam love.

179
00:09:14,291 --> 00:09:15,333
They're delicious.

180
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:17,458
A gift, too?

181
00:09:17,541 --> 00:09:18,791
You're amazing!

182
00:09:18,875 --> 00:09:20,208
We had kagura dances
performed here all the time

183
00:09:20,291 --> 00:09:21,541
at past events.

184
00:09:23,166 --> 00:09:24,916
I did not believe Nanami
would be interested,

185
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,541
so I did not bother
to make mention.

186
00:09:33,208 --> 00:09:34,708
Beautiful!

187
00:09:34,791 --> 00:09:36,333
Try it on over your clothes.

188
00:09:36,416 --> 00:09:37,958
If you would like to, that is.

189
00:09:39,291 --> 00:09:40,458
Can I?

190
00:10:00,458 --> 00:10:02,666
It looks lovely.

191
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:06,000
You make it beautiful.

192
00:10:06,083 --> 00:10:07,833
You really think so?

193
00:10:09,333 --> 00:10:11,291
You've taken such
good care of this shrine.

194
00:10:11,375 --> 00:10:13,000
If you approve of me
doing the dance then

195
00:10:13,083 --> 00:10:15,041
I trust it completely.

196
00:10:16,166 --> 00:10:17,666
Not so fast.

197
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:20,833
I will only approve perfection
and you have not yet rehearsed.

198
00:10:20,916 --> 00:10:23,458
There is not much time
so prepare to work hard.

199
00:10:23,541 --> 00:10:25,250
Whatever you say.

200
00:10:41,541 --> 00:10:42,250
Right.

201
00:10:43,458 --> 00:10:44,250
Left.

202
00:10:44,916 --> 00:10:45,583
Right.

203
00:10:46,583 --> 00:10:47,708
Front.

204
00:10:47,791 --> 00:10:48,583
Left.

205
00:10:48,666 --> 00:10:49,916
Your hand is too high.

206
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,375
You need to slow down.

207
00:10:54,208 --> 00:10:55,166
Good.

208
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:56,541
This is when
you turn to the right.

209
00:10:59,708 --> 00:11:00,875
Other right!

210
00:11:03,708 --> 00:11:05,166
When will you remember?

211
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:07,083
You only have a week to learn
up to the ninth movement

212
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:08,708
and you are still having
trouble with the first!

213
00:11:08,791 --> 00:11:10,333
We do not have time for this!

214
00:11:10,416 --> 00:11:12,750
I'm trying but you're going
through it all so fast.

215
00:11:12,833 --> 00:11:13,916
Can you slow down?

216
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,375
No, I cannot.

217
00:11:15,458 --> 00:11:17,791
You are a slow learner
and must focus.

218
00:11:17,875 --> 00:11:18,583
 Now get up.

219
00:11:18,666 --> 00:11:19,208
There is no time to rest.

220
00:11:19,291 --> 00:11:21,000
We must continue.

221
00:11:21,083 --> 00:11:22,083
Nine movements?

222
00:11:22,166 --> 00:11:24,041
No one wants to
watch me for that long.

223
00:11:24,125 --> 00:11:25,416
Maybe we should
cut that in half?

224
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:26,791
No, Lady Nanami!

225
00:11:26,875 --> 00:11:28,958
It is the land god's duty
to exorcise and cleanse

226
00:11:29,041 --> 00:11:30,541
the land of miasma.

227
00:11:30,625 --> 00:11:33,791
This is the official revival of
sacred rituals at our shrine!

228
00:11:33,875 --> 00:11:36,166
You must do the
complete routine!

229
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:37,875
It would help
if we had music.

230
00:11:37,958 --> 00:11:40,708
Using all the same drum beats
makes it hard to memorize.

231
00:11:40,791 --> 00:11:42,375
You think music would help?

232
00:11:42,458 --> 00:11:44,125
Definitely!

233
00:11:46,791 --> 00:11:49,291
It appears that Mizuki
is on top of your request.

234
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,208
He doesn't even know
how to play that thing!

235
00:11:51,291 --> 00:11:52,333
You will have to wait!

236
00:11:52,416 --> 00:11:54,250
One more time
straight from the top!

237
00:11:54,333 --> 00:11:55,416
Yes, sir!

238
00:11:56,708 --> 00:11:59,541
I don't consider myself
to be a clumsy person.

239
00:11:59,625 --> 00:12:00,875
I'm normally pretty graceful.

240
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:03,333
But when he's around,
I can't keep my balance.

241
00:12:03,416 --> 00:12:04,916
I can't focus.

242
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,625
Watch that arm.

243
00:12:15,791 --> 00:12:16,250
Ow!

244
00:12:16,333 --> 00:12:16,958
My arm!

245
00:12:17,041 --> 00:12:18,041
It's dead!

246
00:12:18,125 --> 00:12:19,166
Good morning.

247
00:12:20,791 --> 00:12:22,708
We are going to learn all the
way to the fifth movement today.

248
00:12:24,291 --> 00:12:24,916
Help!

249
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,875
Slave Driving Fox Alert!

250
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:32,291
That arm is still too high.

251
00:12:33,666 --> 00:12:35,875
You are moving too fast!

252
00:12:35,958 --> 00:12:38,666
That is a left turn,
not a right.

253
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:39,750
Other way!

254
00:12:39,833 --> 00:12:41,541
Why are you making me
repeat myself?

255
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,333
Don't give up, Lady Nanami!

256
00:12:49,416 --> 00:12:50,583
You can do it!

257
00:12:50,666 --> 00:12:51,458
Stop shaking!

258
00:12:51,541 --> 00:12:52,875
That is not part of the dance!

259
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:01,958
Take a three and
a half minute break.

260
00:13:06,416 --> 00:13:07,333
Nanami.

261
00:13:07,416 --> 00:13:08,541
Wha'd I do?

262
00:13:08,625 --> 00:13:09,833
You told me I could
take a break, remember?

263
00:13:09,916 --> 00:13:11,083
Give me your hand.

264
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:14,416
You are getting nervous

265
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,750
because you are only thinking
about achieving perfection.

266
00:13:16,833 --> 00:13:19,708
It is this fear that is
causing you to lose focus.

267
00:13:19,791 --> 00:13:21,291
I have something
that will help you.

268
00:13:22,416 --> 00:13:24,583
It is a magic spell.

269
00:13:24,666 --> 00:13:28,208
Many at the Mikage shrine
have embraced it for decades.

270
00:13:32,083 --> 00:13:33,583
Here, swallow that.

271
00:13:39,833 --> 00:13:41,250
What do you think?

272
00:13:41,333 --> 00:13:43,125
Do you feel more relaxed?

273
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:47,875
It is used to help
swallow fear.

274
00:13:47,958 --> 00:13:50,833
It also serves to
remind you of your divinity.

275
00:13:50,916 --> 00:13:53,625
A god is never intimidated.

276
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:55,458
I feel better!

277
00:13:55,541 --> 00:13:57,500
Thank you but
I know that trick.

278
00:13:57,583 --> 00:14:00,125
We used to play it on each
other when we were kids.

279
00:14:01,791 --> 00:14:03,083
Your break is over!

280
00:14:04,708 --> 00:14:05,333
Yes, sir!

281
00:14:05,416 --> 00:14:06,791
Nanami Momozono.

282
00:14:06,875 --> 00:14:08,375
Seventeen years old.

283
00:14:08,458 --> 00:14:10,750
A typical high school girl that
you might find in any hallway.

284
00:14:10,833 --> 00:14:12,291
Appearance, 'C'.

285
00:14:12,375 --> 00:14:15,625
Athleticism is a 'D.' Spiritual
and divine power, both 'C'.

286
00:14:15,708 --> 00:14:17,916
Add it all up and she's
just an average human.

287
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,208
This isn't going
to be easy, is it?

288
00:14:20,291 --> 00:14:20,708
Nope.

289
00:14:20,791 --> 00:14:21,250
Ugh.

290
00:14:21,333 --> 00:14:22,541
Boring.

291
00:14:22,625 --> 00:14:24,208
What the hell was
Mikage thinking?

292
00:14:24,291 --> 00:14:25,958
Surely there were
stronger options?

293
00:14:26,041 --> 00:14:27,583
The man makes no sense to me.

294
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:30,583
I suppose she has managed
to pass some tests.

295
00:14:30,666 --> 00:14:33,791
That hurdle with Lady Narukami
was quite impressive.

296
00:14:33,875 --> 00:14:37,250
And she did pull through in her
own way that day at the beach

297
00:14:37,333 --> 00:14:39,916
but I still feel like
something is missing.

298
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,083
She's just not serving up that
"land god realness" to me, yet.

299
00:14:43,166 --> 00:14:44,916
I just don't buy it.

300
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,375
This is why I always tell Mikage
to keep his spec lenses cleaned.

301
00:14:48,458 --> 00:14:49,791
They're clean, I assure you.

302
00:14:49,875 --> 00:14:50,916
Don't do that!

303
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,291
How long have you
been sitting there?

304
00:14:52,375 --> 00:14:53,625
Long enough.

305
00:14:53,708 --> 00:14:56,000
The girl has won my faith
in her and that's that.

306
00:15:06,208 --> 00:15:08,916
Then I believe it's
time for a final test.

307
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,708
Good luck, my dear.

308
00:15:10,791 --> 00:15:12,125
Turn to the right!

309
00:15:25,416 --> 00:15:29,458
We go right, left, then around.

310
00:15:29,541 --> 00:15:30,000
No!

311
00:15:30,083 --> 00:15:31,041
That's wrong!

312
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,666
My arm's falling off!

313
00:15:35,583 --> 00:15:38,583
I can't even dance the first
movement all the way through.

314
00:15:38,666 --> 00:15:39,958
What am I doing?

315
00:15:45,208 --> 00:15:48,500
If Tomoe believes in me, then I
must be doing something right.

316
00:15:52,333 --> 00:15:53,958
Ow, that hurts!

317
00:15:58,500 --> 00:15:59,750
I'm such a wuss.

318
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:02,166
Now we know why you scored
a 'D' in athleticism.

319
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:05,000
Who are you?

320
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:14,333
Your manners are
absolutely nauseating.

321
00:16:14,416 --> 00:16:16,916
The one with the lesser social
standing should always be

322
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,708
the first to introduce herself.

323
00:16:18,791 --> 00:16:20,541
Miss Nanami Momozono.

324
00:16:20,625 --> 00:16:23,250
I'm sorry, but how
do you know my name?

325
00:16:23,333 --> 00:16:26,125
You are about to hold a sacred
festival at Mikage's shrine.

326
00:16:26,208 --> 00:16:28,375
I'm here to make
sure you are worthy.

327
00:16:28,458 --> 00:16:30,375
There will be a test to see
if you are truly capable

328
00:16:30,458 --> 00:16:32,458
of carrying out the
duties of a land god.

329
00:16:33,208 --> 00:16:34,208
No, don't!

330
00:16:38,541 --> 00:16:41,875
Who the heck was he or she?

331
00:16:47,083 --> 00:16:47,500
Bye.

332
00:16:47,583 --> 00:16:48,875
Be good!

333
00:16:48,958 --> 00:16:51,666
Exorcising this level of
miasma should be no problem

334
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:53,458
for a true land god.

335
00:16:53,541 --> 00:16:56,208
Let's see what you've got,
Little Miss Nanami.

336
00:17:04,958 --> 00:17:08,333
Miasma but why?

337
00:17:08,416 --> 00:17:10,625
Everything was fine yesterday.

338
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,583
Tomoe just finished
cleaning that pavilion.

339
00:17:30,875 --> 00:17:32,166
I don't get it.

340
00:17:38,916 --> 00:17:42,541
It is because of your presence
here that the air appears clear.

341
00:17:42,625 --> 00:17:45,000
Uninhabited shrines tend
to attract negative energy

342
00:17:45,083 --> 00:17:47,625
as well as a strong
miasma into the air.

343
00:17:47,708 --> 00:17:50,625
Even I would be
incapable of exorcising it.

344
00:17:50,708 --> 00:17:52,500
Think back to when
you first arrived.

345
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,666
The place has become
considerably more beautiful,

346
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:58,083
has it not?

347
00:18:12,166 --> 00:18:15,041
It's okay, I'm fine.

348
00:18:15,125 --> 00:18:17,250
I just need to relax.

349
00:18:28,958 --> 00:18:30,208
Purify!

350
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:43,458
Beauty!

351
00:18:49,291 --> 00:18:50,458
Cleansing!

352
00:18:53,166 --> 00:18:55,000
Exorcise!

353
00:18:55,083 --> 00:18:56,416
And a Purge!

354
00:18:57,958 --> 00:18:58,458
Clean.

355
00:18:58,541 --> 00:18:59,458
Clean!

356
00:18:59,541 --> 00:19:00,708
Go away.

357
00:19:00,791 --> 00:19:02,333
Please leave!

358
00:19:02,416 --> 00:19:03,958
I said disappear!

359
00:19:18,541 --> 00:19:19,916
But why?

360
00:19:23,083 --> 00:19:24,041
God Beam!

361
00:19:24,125 --> 00:19:25,208
God Beam!

362
00:19:25,291 --> 00:19:26,458
God--

363
00:19:31,458 --> 00:19:32,541
Morning, Nanami!

364
00:19:32,625 --> 00:19:34,041
Good news!

365
00:19:34,125 --> 00:19:36,333
I've been practicing and I
think I can make a sound now!

366
00:19:40,833 --> 00:19:42,583
What is going on here?

367
00:19:42,666 --> 00:19:45,541
The miasma around the shrine
has grown much thicker!

368
00:19:45,625 --> 00:19:46,666
There you are!

369
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:48,000
I don't understand.

370
00:19:48,083 --> 00:19:49,791
It was clear until yesterday.

371
00:19:49,875 --> 00:19:52,458
Do you think Nanami's
powers are up to the task?

372
00:19:53,458 --> 00:19:54,625
Where is she?

373
00:19:57,625 --> 00:19:59,250
Nanami!

374
00:19:59,333 --> 00:20:01,208
Tomoe.

375
00:20:01,291 --> 00:20:03,916
I tried my best to exorcise it.

376
00:20:05,958 --> 00:20:07,541
Nanami!

377
00:20:07,625 --> 00:20:08,875
Is she okay?

378
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:09,541
Yes.

379
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:11,250
Can you handle this?

380
00:20:11,333 --> 00:20:12,791
There's so much of it!

381
00:20:12,875 --> 00:20:14,416
But I'll give it a try.

382
00:20:15,833 --> 00:20:17,041
The shrine!

383
00:20:18,625 --> 00:20:19,708
Stay in bed.

384
00:20:19,791 --> 00:20:22,125
We will find a way
to take care of this.

385
00:20:22,208 --> 00:20:23,458
But exorcising miasma

386
00:20:23,541 --> 00:20:25,666
from the land is the land
god's responsibility.

387
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:26,750
I have to do it!

388
00:20:26,833 --> 00:20:29,625
We do not need you.

389
00:20:29,708 --> 00:20:31,125
Do not move from that spot.

390
00:20:43,666 --> 00:20:44,750
Do you have any more than that?

391
00:20:44,833 --> 00:20:46,000
Of course I do!

392
00:20:46,083 --> 00:20:48,041
It's my sacred sake so
I have plenty to use.

393
00:20:48,125 --> 00:20:50,041
However, this is only
a temporary fix.

394
00:20:50,125 --> 00:20:52,500
As soon as it dries,
it loses effect.

395
00:20:52,583 --> 00:20:54,291
Could you be any more useless?

396
00:20:54,375 --> 00:20:55,458
You haven't even made
an attempt to help

397
00:20:55,541 --> 00:20:56,666
so I don't want to hear it!

398
00:21:06,375 --> 00:21:07,500
I've failed.

399
00:21:10,083 --> 00:21:14,416
I haven't even begun to live up
to Tomoe's expectations.

400
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:17,625
I let him down.

401
00:21:17,708 --> 00:21:20,125
He's always the one
who has to save me.

402
00:21:20,208 --> 00:21:22,250
I'm supposed to be the god.

403
00:21:24,416 --> 00:21:26,625
But the truth is--

404
00:21:26,708 --> 00:21:28,375
We do not need you.

405
00:21:30,958 --> 00:21:32,625
I haven't tried.

406
00:21:39,875 --> 00:21:41,750
Not hard enough.

407
00:21:41,833 --> 00:21:44,333
I haven't accomplished anything.

408
00:21:44,416 --> 00:21:46,416
I'm not important.

409
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,666
I'm not needed.

410
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:50,416
I'm a failure.

411
00:21:52,208 --> 00:21:53,625
Nanami?

412
00:21:55,541 --> 00:21:57,375
Where is she?

413
00:22:08,791 --> 00:22:10,666
Nanami!

414
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:12,291
Where are you?

415
00:22:18,625 --> 00:22:21,083
I'm going into town, Tomoe.

416
00:22:27,875 --> 00:22:30,625
Where could you be?

417
00:22:30,708 --> 00:22:32,750
Nanami!

418
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:50,041
The miasma is out of control
at the Mikage shrine.

419
00:23:50,125 --> 00:23:52,250
Nanami feels helpless
so she runs away!

420
00:23:52,333 --> 00:23:54,416
Tomoe looks for her
but she is well hidden!

421
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:55,291
Is this how it ends?

422
00:23:55,375 --> 00:23:56,666
Will they be apart forever?

423
00:23:56,750 --> 00:24:00,250
Next time, "Kamisama Kiss!"
It's the final episode!

424
00:24:00,333 --> 00:24:00,875
Aw, it's been fun!
