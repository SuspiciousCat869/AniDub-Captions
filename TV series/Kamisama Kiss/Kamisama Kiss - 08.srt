1
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:42,166
Looks like summer break is
just around the corner!

2
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:46,375
And there's our darling heroine,
Nanami, simply beaming with joy!

3
00:01:46,458 --> 00:01:48,625
Today she's gathered
with Ami and Kei

4
00:01:48,708 --> 00:01:50,666
to make exciting vacation plans!

5
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:52,583
Oh, what fun they're having!

6
00:01:52,666 --> 00:01:54,041
Are you reading
the right script?

7
00:01:54,125 --> 00:01:55,750
That's not what's
happening here at all!

8
00:01:55,833 --> 00:01:56,916
Whoopsie.

9
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:57,958
You can't just make
things up as you go!

10
00:01:58,041 --> 00:01:59,125
Stay focused!

11
00:01:59,208 --> 00:02:00,208
Sorry.

12
00:02:01,708 --> 00:02:03,458
All this heat is getting to me.

13
00:02:03,541 --> 00:02:05,291
Ah yes, I remember now!

14
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:08,083
Last time, she discovered
love was blooming in her heart

15
00:02:08,166 --> 00:02:10,541
and soon after, had it
ripped out and stomped upon.

16
00:02:10,625 --> 00:02:12,541
So, no, she's not joyous at all.

17
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:15,500
Hey I have a good idea!

18
00:02:15,583 --> 00:02:17,166
Why don't we go to
the beach over break?

19
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:18,708
Doesn't that sound
like fun, Nanami?

20
00:02:18,791 --> 00:02:19,625
Yeah, fun.

21
00:02:19,708 --> 00:02:20,333
The beach.

22
00:02:20,416 --> 00:02:21,208
Love it.

23
00:02:21,291 --> 00:02:22,250
Let's go to the Alps right now.

24
00:02:22,333 --> 00:02:23,166
When are we leaving?

25
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:23,916
Her brain!

26
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,041
It's like mush!

27
00:02:25,125 --> 00:02:26,625
That's awful!

28
00:02:26,708 --> 00:02:28,333
The dude she stripped down to
her soul in front of pretty much

29
00:02:28,416 --> 00:02:30,000
told her to take a cold shower.

30
00:02:30,083 --> 00:02:31,041
I kinda get it.

31
00:02:31,125 --> 00:02:32,625
Guess you're still not hungry?

32
00:02:32,708 --> 00:02:35,708
You should at least try to
eat a few bites of rice?

33
00:02:35,791 --> 00:02:36,833
No, seriously.

34
00:02:36,916 --> 00:02:37,916
You look like you're
about to pass out.

35
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:38,708
Please?

36
00:02:38,791 --> 00:02:40,000
Listen to her.

37
00:02:40,083 --> 00:02:42,125
You scarcely had anything
to eat this morning

38
00:02:42,208 --> 00:02:43,708
and now you are refusing lunch?

39
00:02:43,791 --> 00:02:45,416
What is the meaning
behind this?

40
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:48,000
If you are fasting, the
timing is inappropriate.

41
00:02:48,083 --> 00:02:50,958
I want to stay strong and stay
in control of my feelings.

42
00:02:51,041 --> 00:02:52,791
But it's difficult when he
can show up out of nowhere

43
00:02:52,875 --> 00:02:54,750
and catch me off guard.

44
00:02:54,833 --> 00:02:55,500
It's not a fast.

45
00:02:55,583 --> 00:02:56,666
I'm not hungry.

46
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:57,666
Too bad.

47
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:59,458
Please stop, it won't work.

48
00:02:59,541 --> 00:03:01,750
She still hasn't recovered
from being rejected by you

49
00:03:01,833 --> 00:03:04,416
so you getting mad at her
is just making it worse.

50
00:03:06,875 --> 00:03:09,166
I can't get a grip
on my emotions.

51
00:03:10,416 --> 00:03:11,875
Thank you for your help.

52
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:13,541
Now, if you are refusing to eat,
then you leave me no choice

53
00:03:13,625 --> 00:03:16,125
but to pry your mouth open
and force feed you.

54
00:03:18,375 --> 00:03:20,333
You know I hate mushrooms!

55
00:03:39,125 --> 00:03:43,000
And then I realized I'm the only
one whose feelings changed.

56
00:03:43,083 --> 00:03:45,666
Tomoe is just the same
as he's always been.

57
00:03:48,541 --> 00:03:51,750
There's only one exception.

58
00:03:51,833 --> 00:03:55,541
Now he's doing everything
he can to avoid touching me.

59
00:03:57,583 --> 00:03:59,000
I'm sorry, Nanami.

60
00:03:59,083 --> 00:04:01,375
I know this is hard but I love
you and I'm here for you!

61
00:04:01,458 --> 00:04:03,166
And I'm dying to take you
to the beach!

62
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:04,500
We'll have so much
fun that you'll forget

63
00:04:04,583 --> 00:04:06,541
all about what happened!

64
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:10,000
'Kay!

65
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:10,666
You're on.

66
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:11,375
When?

67
00:04:11,458 --> 00:04:12,458
How 'bout Saturday?

68
00:04:12,541 --> 00:04:13,791
Yeah, that sounds
like a lot of fun,

69
00:04:13,875 --> 00:04:16,000
but do either of you
have swimsuits?

70
00:04:16,083 --> 00:04:17,000
Uh.

71
00:04:17,083 --> 00:04:18,250
No.

72
00:04:18,333 --> 00:04:19,833
The ocean?

73
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:28,791
I'm here to see Nanami!

74
00:04:30,458 --> 00:04:31,208
Are you kidding?

75
00:04:31,291 --> 00:04:32,583
What do you mean I can't go?

76
00:04:32,666 --> 00:04:34,208
I mean you cannot
go to the ocean!

77
00:04:34,291 --> 00:04:35,541
But why not?

78
00:04:35,625 --> 00:04:38,083
Ami went out of her way
plan it all and invite me!

79
00:04:38,166 --> 00:04:39,166
This is so unfair!

80
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:41,750
Please do not be upset,
Lady Nanami.

81
00:04:41,833 --> 00:04:43,625
It is filled with
demonic creatures.

82
00:04:43,708 --> 00:04:45,625
If you were human, it might be
a different story, but you are

83
00:04:45,708 --> 00:04:48,708
a land god and I cannot risk
something terrible happening.

84
00:04:48,791 --> 00:04:49,916
Also--

85
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,791
I cannot go into the
ocean to protect you.

86
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:53,041
The answer is no.

87
00:04:53,125 --> 00:04:54,083
I'll be fine!

88
00:04:54,166 --> 00:04:55,833
My friends will
be there with me!

89
00:04:55,916 --> 00:04:57,166
Is that so?

90
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:58,833
You believe your friends
could stand up to demons?

91
00:04:58,916 --> 00:05:00,041
No, they can't.

92
00:05:00,125 --> 00:05:01,791
But I could always use
a day at the beach.

93
00:05:01,875 --> 00:05:03,375
Take me.

94
00:05:03,458 --> 00:05:04,750
You mean it?

95
00:05:07,916 --> 00:05:09,250
We're here!

96
00:05:09,333 --> 00:05:10,791
The beach!

97
00:05:10,875 --> 00:05:12,000
You've got to be kidding.

98
00:05:12,083 --> 00:05:13,250
Seriously?

99
00:05:13,333 --> 00:05:15,250
Someone want to tell me
what they're doing here?

100
00:05:15,333 --> 00:05:17,041
Looks like we made it!

101
00:05:17,125 --> 00:05:18,833
Okay, we can't have guys
hanging around us.

102
00:05:18,916 --> 00:05:20,250
It's gonna look like
we're 'with' you.

103
00:05:20,333 --> 00:05:21,833
No one will come
cruising for us!

104
00:05:21,916 --> 00:05:23,125
Which cruise line?

105
00:05:23,208 --> 00:05:24,708
P.S.

106
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:28,208
Forgot to tell you Kei broke up
with her boyfriend yesterday.

107
00:05:28,291 --> 00:05:31,083
The plan to escape thoughts
of Tomoe didn't work.

108
00:05:31,166 --> 00:05:33,208
My stomach hurts.

109
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:35,083
Who's ready to go swimming?

110
00:05:35,166 --> 00:05:36,958
You look like a freaking
toddler with that thing.

111
00:05:37,041 --> 00:05:37,833
Be nice.

112
00:05:37,916 --> 00:05:39,250
I just don't know how to swim.

113
00:05:39,333 --> 00:05:40,791
How do you feel
about that swimsuit?

114
00:05:40,875 --> 00:05:41,916
Is it working out?

115
00:05:43,916 --> 00:05:44,958
It's really cute.

116
00:05:45,041 --> 00:05:45,833
I love it.

117
00:05:45,916 --> 00:05:47,833
Thank you for loaning it to me!

118
00:05:47,916 --> 00:05:49,916
I've honestly never
worn anything like this!

119
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,333
No problem.

120
00:05:51,416 --> 00:05:52,708
Whatever keeps you from swimming
next to me in a t-shirt,

121
00:05:52,791 --> 00:05:54,208
ya know?

122
00:05:54,291 --> 00:05:55,541
Why don't you go show it off
to your buddies over there?

123
00:05:55,625 --> 00:05:57,541
See what they think?

124
00:05:57,625 --> 00:05:59,708
It'll give them
something to do, at least.

125
00:06:01,291 --> 00:06:03,958
They definitely don't look like
they're interested in swimming.

126
00:06:09,541 --> 00:06:10,541
I don't care what they do!

127
00:06:10,625 --> 00:06:11,291
Let's go swim!

128
00:06:11,375 --> 00:06:12,166
You sure?

129
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:13,166
Positive!

130
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:15,125
It's their fault
for following me!

131
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:16,208
I'm gonna throw up.

132
00:06:16,291 --> 00:06:18,083
Why am I feeling so
self-conscious?

133
00:06:18,166 --> 00:06:19,500
Hurry up, Nanami!

134
00:06:19,583 --> 00:06:21,291
Let's ride some waves!

135
00:06:21,375 --> 00:06:23,041
Do I look all right in this?

136
00:06:23,125 --> 00:06:25,000
Or is it awkward?

137
00:06:25,083 --> 00:06:27,208
Is it obvious the
swimsuit isn't mine?

138
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:33,208
What are you doing here, Tomoe?

139
00:06:33,291 --> 00:06:34,333
Besides lurking.

140
00:06:34,416 --> 00:06:36,125
I could ask you
the same question.

141
00:06:36,208 --> 00:06:38,375
Girls these days are so
shameless, aren't they?

142
00:06:38,458 --> 00:06:40,291
They wander around in
practically nothing without

143
00:06:40,375 --> 00:06:42,166
any concern for who's looking.

144
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:46,458
At this rate, even human guys
will turn into beastly yokai.

145
00:06:46,541 --> 00:06:48,375
You are having at least
somewhat of a good time here,

146
00:06:48,458 --> 00:06:49,458
are you not?

147
00:06:51,041 --> 00:06:52,750
I must admit, I was quite
surprised you risked

148
00:06:52,833 --> 00:06:54,708
coming at all today.

149
00:06:54,791 --> 00:06:56,291
And, in case you've forgotten,

150
00:06:56,375 --> 00:06:59,083
I do know exactly why you
can't go into the ocean.

151
00:07:02,958 --> 00:07:04,000
Let me to be frank.

152
00:07:04,083 --> 00:07:06,250
I hate you, Tomoe.

153
00:07:06,333 --> 00:07:08,958
But I will play nice
for Nanami's sake.

154
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:13,958
Nanami, wait for me!

155
00:07:14,041 --> 00:07:15,583
I want to go swimming, too!

156
00:07:18,416 --> 00:07:19,541
C'mon!

157
00:07:22,916 --> 00:07:24,000
You guys!

158
00:07:24,083 --> 00:07:26,250
This beach has so many
beautiful shells!

159
00:07:26,333 --> 00:07:27,375
Pretty, huh?

160
00:07:28,625 --> 00:07:29,958
Yes, it is.

161
00:07:31,708 --> 00:07:32,083
Well.

162
00:07:32,166 --> 00:07:33,625
Let's go.

163
00:07:33,708 --> 00:07:36,000
Tomoe says he hates anything
that has to do with the ocean.

164
00:07:36,083 --> 00:07:37,250
He does?

165
00:07:43,416 --> 00:07:44,500
He doesn't know
how to appreciate...

166
00:07:44,583 --> 00:07:47,250
He knows exactly
how to get to me.

167
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:50,208
Touching her because I cannot.

168
00:07:50,291 --> 00:07:52,541
Damn bastard snake.

169
00:08:07,875 --> 00:08:10,750
So, our little white serpent
boy is a water baby?

170
00:08:10,833 --> 00:08:13,083
A dip in the sea does
sound delightful.

171
00:08:16,875 --> 00:08:18,666
Wink!

172
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:20,250
Have a good time.

173
00:08:24,125 --> 00:08:26,416
You could come with me
instead of taking up space.

174
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:28,083
I'd like to keep
a safe distance.

175
00:08:28,166 --> 00:08:31,000
If I get closer, Tomoe will
definitely recognize me.

176
00:08:31,083 --> 00:08:32,333
Fine.

177
00:08:32,416 --> 00:08:33,166
Then will you at least
explain why you're dressed

178
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:34,250
like an Eskimo in this heat?

179
00:08:34,333 --> 00:08:35,041
Ew.

180
00:08:35,125 --> 00:08:36,041
It's part of my image.

181
00:08:36,125 --> 00:08:37,166
People expect it.

182
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:38,041
Ah.

183
00:08:38,125 --> 00:08:39,541
Yes, well, I can respect that.

184
00:08:39,625 --> 00:08:41,750
And I suppose you
are wise to lay low.

185
00:08:41,833 --> 00:08:43,750
I mean, you abandoned the guy
for 20 years and now here

186
00:08:43,833 --> 00:08:45,625
you are lounging on
the beach in your furs

187
00:08:45,708 --> 00:08:47,416
and secretly watching over him.

188
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:49,125
I imagine he'd
kill you if he knew.

189
00:08:49,208 --> 00:08:50,458
Tomoe would never do that.

190
00:08:50,541 --> 00:08:52,833
At worst, I can expect
a jump-kick to the head.

191
00:08:54,291 --> 00:08:55,791
I don't know.

192
00:08:55,875 --> 00:08:59,000
Behind those depressing eyebrows
and kill-me-now frown, I think,

193
00:08:59,083 --> 00:09:00,958
perhaps Tomoe has a more
compassionate side

194
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:02,958
he doesn't always show.

195
00:09:05,958 --> 00:09:07,208
That girl.

196
00:09:07,291 --> 00:09:09,333
I wonder if things
are different with her?

197
00:09:14,583 --> 00:09:16,000
Toodles!

198
00:09:19,583 --> 00:09:20,750
Oh how I do love him,

199
00:09:20,833 --> 00:09:23,250
but it's easy to forget
he's a god sometimes.

200
00:09:24,916 --> 00:09:26,041
On second thought.

201
00:09:27,666 --> 00:09:29,583
It is a beautiful day.

202
00:09:31,583 --> 00:09:34,166
I suppose it would be
silly not to go for a swim.

203
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:44,041
It's so pretty!

204
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:44,833
For you!

205
00:09:44,916 --> 00:09:45,458
Really?

206
00:09:45,541 --> 00:09:46,875
Thanks, I love it!

207
00:09:46,958 --> 00:09:48,125
So then?

208
00:09:48,208 --> 00:09:49,750
You having fun?

209
00:09:49,833 --> 00:09:51,541
Yeah, the water feels amazing!

210
00:09:51,625 --> 00:09:52,958
That's good!

211
00:09:53,041 --> 00:09:54,166
I'm glad you came.

212
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:55,291
I was getting worried.

213
00:09:55,375 --> 00:09:56,625
You were so sad.

214
00:10:05,541 --> 00:10:06,958
Let's get this moving.

215
00:10:15,208 --> 00:10:16,375
Ami?

216
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:28,000
There is something disturbing
about the way sea water feels.

217
00:10:28,083 --> 00:10:29,208
Ever notice that?

218
00:10:29,291 --> 00:10:31,125
Goodness, what has
happened to you, Tomoe?

219
00:10:31,208 --> 00:10:34,416
Your face is even more furry
and frightening than usual.

220
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:35,333
Tomoe!

221
00:10:35,416 --> 00:10:37,041
It's Ami and Nanami!

222
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:41,083
What happened?

223
00:10:41,166 --> 00:10:41,666
Nanami!

224
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:42,458
Ami!

225
00:10:42,541 --> 00:10:43,666
I lost her!

226
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:45,875
I went down to look
and couldn't find her!

227
00:10:45,958 --> 00:10:47,000
She doesn't know how to swim!

228
00:10:47,083 --> 00:10:48,250
She could be drowning!

229
00:10:48,333 --> 00:10:50,541
We have to get to her
before it's too late!

230
00:10:50,625 --> 00:10:51,458
Please, Tomoe!

231
00:10:51,541 --> 00:10:53,000
I need your help!

232
00:11:04,875 --> 00:11:06,125
Leave it to me.

233
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:08,166
Really?

234
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:09,791
Are you sure about this?

235
00:11:09,875 --> 00:11:12,708
Nanami has requested my
help in her time of need.

236
00:11:12,791 --> 00:11:14,458
It cannot be helped.

237
00:11:20,583 --> 00:11:21,541
Ami.

238
00:11:22,416 --> 00:11:23,375
Ami?

239
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:28,416
Time to go back.

240
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:40,208
You found her!

241
00:11:40,291 --> 00:11:41,041
Ami!

242
00:11:41,125 --> 00:11:41,833
How are you feeling?

243
00:11:41,916 --> 00:11:43,041
Are you okay?

244
00:11:44,625 --> 00:11:45,916
Uh yeah, I'm fine.

245
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,208
I just swallowed
a lot of water.

246
00:11:47,291 --> 00:11:48,416
What's wrong with you?

247
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,291
Why did you take off
by yourself like that?

248
00:11:50,375 --> 00:11:50,958
Sorry!

249
00:11:51,041 --> 00:11:51,958
Thank goodness!

250
00:11:52,041 --> 00:11:53,250
Thank you.

251
00:11:55,083 --> 00:11:57,083
You saved her life!

252
00:11:59,875 --> 00:12:01,208
Isn't that sweet?

253
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,916
Yes, thank you, Tomoe.

254
00:12:13,875 --> 00:12:17,291
So nice of you to drop
by the ocean for a visit.

255
00:12:17,375 --> 00:12:18,708
Here you are,

256
00:12:18,791 --> 00:12:21,250
right when I'd started giving
up on ever finding you.

257
00:12:32,041 --> 00:12:35,208
I've been waiting a lifetime
for you to join me for a swim,

258
00:12:35,291 --> 00:12:37,000
Tomoe.

259
00:12:37,083 --> 00:12:38,083
Who're you?

260
00:12:38,166 --> 00:12:39,250
Thought you'd never ask.

261
00:12:39,333 --> 00:12:41,958
I am the Dragon King,
ruler of the sea.

262
00:12:42,041 --> 00:12:44,791
Do yourself a favor
and try to remember that.

263
00:12:47,541 --> 00:12:48,750
What's happening?

264
00:12:55,958 --> 00:12:56,708
Kei?

265
00:12:56,791 --> 00:12:57,375
Ami?

266
00:12:57,458 --> 00:12:59,000
Can you hear me?

267
00:12:59,083 --> 00:13:01,208
Sorry, but I'm going to ask the
spectators to stay out of this.

268
00:13:01,291 --> 00:13:02,666
If you'll excuse me
for just a moment,

269
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:05,875
it's time for me to collect
a debt from an old friend.

270
00:13:05,958 --> 00:13:06,875
A debt?

271
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:08,666
I only wish I knew
what that meant.

272
00:13:14,166 --> 00:13:15,500
Tomoe!

273
00:13:15,583 --> 00:13:19,208
I am more than happy to
remind you, you ignorant fox!

274
00:13:19,291 --> 00:13:21,416
Exactly five hundred
twenty six years,

275
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,708
two hundred and eight days ago,
at eighteen minutes and

276
00:13:23,791 --> 00:13:25,875
forty-one seconds past two AM.

277
00:13:25,958 --> 00:13:29,708
A certain yokai fox called
Tomoe, attacked and wiped out

278
00:13:29,791 --> 00:13:32,666
seven dragons,
three sharks, five rays,

279
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:36,375
and one sea slug platoon
at the north gate of my palace.

280
00:13:36,458 --> 00:13:39,500
He then destroyed the north gate
and surrounding buildings.

281
00:13:39,583 --> 00:13:42,541
And finally, he stole
my right eye and fled.

282
00:13:42,625 --> 00:13:44,125
You are that fox, Tomoe.

283
00:13:44,208 --> 00:13:46,250
The time has come
for you to pay it back.

284
00:13:46,333 --> 00:13:50,291
If you refuse, then I have
no problem taking it from you.

285
00:13:50,375 --> 00:13:52,416
Giant White-Lipped Oyster!

286
00:14:01,291 --> 00:14:04,125
You will slowly turn into
sustenance for the oyster now.

287
00:14:04,208 --> 00:14:07,708
And in a day or so, I'll return
to find a king sized pearl.

288
00:14:07,791 --> 00:14:10,125
Excellent choice as always
your majesty, sea slug.

289
00:14:10,208 --> 00:14:12,375
That despicable wild
creature never stood a chance

290
00:14:12,458 --> 00:14:15,083
against your powerful new
and improved form, sea slug.

291
00:14:15,166 --> 00:14:16,375
That's the truth!

292
00:14:16,458 --> 00:14:18,041
I've been rebuilding
my strength every day for

293
00:14:18,125 --> 00:14:21,000
five hundred twenty-six years,
two hundred and eight days.

294
00:14:21,083 --> 00:14:22,333
It's about time it paid off!

295
00:14:22,416 --> 00:14:23,875
Let's head back
for a celebration!

296
00:14:23,958 --> 00:14:24,583
Sea slug!

297
00:14:24,666 --> 00:14:25,750
Hold it!

298
00:14:25,833 --> 00:14:27,791
What do you think
you're doing with Tomoe?

299
00:14:27,875 --> 00:14:30,000
Hey, wait a second,
why aren't you sleeping?

300
00:14:30,083 --> 00:14:31,541
What are you even doing here?

301
00:14:31,625 --> 00:14:33,416
I want you to let him
out of there!

302
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:34,791
Is that so?

303
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:35,708
Sorry.

304
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:36,958
I wish there was
more I could do.

305
00:14:37,041 --> 00:14:39,041
Run along, now, little girl.

306
00:14:43,708 --> 00:14:45,583
I can't let them get away!

307
00:14:45,666 --> 00:14:47,041
Tomoe!

308
00:14:47,125 --> 00:14:49,375
I cannot go into the
ocean to protect you.

309
00:14:49,458 --> 00:14:51,166
He tried to warn me.

310
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:52,916
I didn't listen!

311
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,291
I made him go!

312
00:14:54,375 --> 00:14:55,958
It's my fault.

313
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:01,208
It's scary to think that
even with all his power,

314
00:15:01,291 --> 00:15:03,833
I could lose him and
never see him again.

315
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:08,375
I can't breathe!

316
00:15:08,458 --> 00:15:09,916
Tomoe!

317
00:15:10,583 --> 00:15:12,791
Your persistence is obnoxious.

318
00:15:18,291 --> 00:15:19,750
Does this mean you're done?

319
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:22,458
Where is he?

320
00:15:22,541 --> 00:15:24,000
I had the sea slugs
relocate him.

321
00:15:24,083 --> 00:15:25,625
He's far, far away.

322
00:15:25,708 --> 00:15:27,750
Yes, I did carry you to safety.

323
00:15:27,833 --> 00:15:29,041
You are welcome.

324
00:15:29,125 --> 00:15:30,250
Now you owe me.

325
00:15:30,333 --> 00:15:31,125
Fine!

326
00:15:31,208 --> 00:15:31,958
Anything you want.

327
00:15:32,041 --> 00:15:34,041
Just give me Tomoe back!

328
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:40,250
I'm afraid his debt is
much larger than yours.

329
00:15:40,333 --> 00:15:43,625
I will not release him
until it is paid in full.

330
00:15:43,708 --> 00:15:44,333
Let it go.

331
00:15:44,416 --> 00:15:45,625
I'll help him repay you!

332
00:15:45,708 --> 00:15:48,125
What do I have to do to
get you to set him free?

333
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:51,916
Since you asked.

334
00:15:55,958 --> 00:15:58,958
I want you to return to me
what is rightfully mine.

335
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:00,875
Find a way to bring me
back my right eye

336
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:03,541
and I will consider
sparing his miserable life.

337
00:16:03,625 --> 00:16:06,750
You see, my eye is a pill of
eternal youth and immortality.

338
00:16:06,833 --> 00:16:09,791
It's said that whoever swallows
it will gain great powers.

339
00:16:09,875 --> 00:16:13,458
All those years ago, I lost it
to that insignificant yokai.

340
00:16:13,541 --> 00:16:17,708
I, the Dragon King, had
defeat carved into my face!

341
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:23,083
So then all I have to do

342
00:16:23,166 --> 00:16:24,750
is return the eye and you
promise you'll let him go?

343
00:16:24,833 --> 00:16:27,208
'All you have to do?'
As if it's that simple.

344
00:16:27,291 --> 00:16:29,708
My dear, it's been five
hundred twenty-six years.

345
00:16:29,791 --> 00:16:32,208
I'm certain something's
happened to it by now.

346
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:33,541
Like I said, just let it go.

347
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:35,333
No, wait!

348
00:16:35,416 --> 00:16:36,416
Promise me.

349
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:37,875
If I can find the eye
and return it,

350
00:16:37,958 --> 00:16:40,208
that you will let Tomoe live.

351
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:44,916
You really think
this is possible.

352
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,166
Alright but I'm only
holding onto the fox

353
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:49,333
as collateral for two days.

354
00:16:51,541 --> 00:16:56,791
If that's the only way to save
Tomoe, I have to find it.

355
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:02,166
Why have I never
eaten ice cream before.

356
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:04,000
So sweet and creamy
and delicious--

357
00:17:04,083 --> 00:17:06,166
Who the hell said you
could be happy today?

358
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:08,083
Nanami and Tomoe are missing
and you're sitting here

359
00:17:08,166 --> 00:17:10,208
lounging around like
it's some damn vacation!

360
00:17:10,291 --> 00:17:11,458
You even took a bath!

361
00:17:11,541 --> 00:17:14,375
Has anyone even bothered
to call the police?

362
00:17:14,458 --> 00:17:15,208
Of course not.

363
00:17:15,291 --> 00:17:16,708
There's no need to worry.

364
00:17:16,791 --> 00:17:18,291
Nanami will be back tomorrow.

365
00:17:18,375 --> 00:17:20,666
I think we could all use
a good night's rest.

366
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:22,833
So I will be sleeping
on the middle futon.

367
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:24,625
I tend to get lonely by myself.

368
00:17:24,708 --> 00:17:25,708
I don't think so.

369
00:17:25,791 --> 00:17:27,583
This room was reserved
for three girls.

370
00:17:27,666 --> 00:17:30,000
You and Tomoe can find
your own place to cuddle.

371
00:17:32,333 --> 00:17:33,208
No way!

372
00:17:33,291 --> 00:17:34,458
Nanami!

373
00:17:34,541 --> 00:17:35,916
Where have you been?

374
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,791
Are you okay?

375
00:17:37,875 --> 00:17:40,083
I'm sorry for making you worry.

376
00:17:40,166 --> 00:17:41,166
I got lost.

377
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:42,250
See?

378
00:17:42,333 --> 00:17:44,041
I told you she'd be fine,
didn't I?

379
00:17:44,125 --> 00:17:45,750
Mizuki!

380
00:17:48,875 --> 00:17:51,916
I need to borrow the
time-wending incense burner.

381
00:17:56,625 --> 00:17:59,458
I have to go back in time
and find the old Tomoe.

382
00:17:59,541 --> 00:18:00,750
He has the Dragon King's eye,

383
00:18:00,833 --> 00:18:02,958
and I'm going to
take it from him.

384
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:05,083
I was told that if I returned
the eye to the Dragon King

385
00:18:05,166 --> 00:18:07,875
in two days, then Tomoe's
life would be spared.

386
00:18:07,958 --> 00:18:09,166
So please.

387
00:18:10,708 --> 00:18:12,291
There's a question
I want to ask you.

388
00:18:12,375 --> 00:18:14,916
One of the girls told me
something and I'm fascinated.

389
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,333
Is it true that you
have feelings for Tomoe?

390
00:18:18,416 --> 00:18:19,041
What?

391
00:18:19,125 --> 00:18:20,041
Why would they say that?

392
00:18:20,125 --> 00:18:21,166
Not that it's
anyone's business.

393
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:22,166
And besides that--

394
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:25,083
I think he's quite fortunate.

395
00:18:25,166 --> 00:18:28,333
He has a kind lady and mistress
who loves him as much as you do.

396
00:18:28,416 --> 00:18:29,958
I admit; it hurts.

397
00:18:32,875 --> 00:18:34,375
I hate Tomoe.

398
00:18:34,458 --> 00:18:36,875
I don't feel he
deserves all that he has.

399
00:18:36,958 --> 00:18:38,958
If it were up to me,
I would have him stay missing

400
00:18:39,041 --> 00:18:41,458
and consider it
a small miracle.

401
00:18:41,541 --> 00:18:42,458
I know.

402
00:18:42,541 --> 00:18:43,875
What I'm saying
is not very kind.

403
00:18:43,958 --> 00:18:46,958
It's what they describe
as jealousy or envy.

404
00:18:47,041 --> 00:18:49,500
I feel terrible about it
but I don't know what to do.

405
00:18:49,583 --> 00:18:52,208
Have you ever been this way?

406
00:18:52,291 --> 00:18:53,458
Please tell me.

407
00:18:53,541 --> 00:18:56,458
What can I do to make
these thoughts go away?

408
00:19:04,333 --> 00:19:05,416
I'm sorry.

409
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:06,250
I know.

410
00:19:06,333 --> 00:19:08,833
I know this is hard for you.

411
00:19:08,916 --> 00:19:12,666
But, you're the only one
I know who can help.

412
00:19:14,541 --> 00:19:17,875
I must admit, it's hard to say
no when you put it like that.

413
00:19:18,958 --> 00:19:21,791
Messing with the past
is considered quite taboo.

414
00:19:21,875 --> 00:19:23,500
But, I doubt anyone
will challenge it because

415
00:19:23,583 --> 00:19:26,291
you're a god, so there is
really nothing to worry about.

416
00:19:26,375 --> 00:19:28,375
So you carry that
thing with you?

417
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:29,625
I do.

418
00:19:29,708 --> 00:19:31,166
Ever since my home got
submerged, I've made it

419
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:33,875
a rule to carry
everything of value with me.

420
00:19:33,958 --> 00:19:35,458
Last time, I only
sent your soul.

421
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:36,708
This will be different.

422
00:19:36,791 --> 00:19:38,083
Tonight you will be
travelling over there

423
00:19:38,166 --> 00:19:39,500
as your corporal self.

424
00:19:39,583 --> 00:19:40,750
I will accompany you.

425
00:19:40,833 --> 00:19:43,458
However, I will only be
available as your guide.

426
00:19:43,541 --> 00:19:46,291
You will have to
complete the task.

427
00:20:01,708 --> 00:20:03,000
Tomoe.

428
00:20:04,291 --> 00:20:05,500
Tomoe.

429
00:20:06,291 --> 00:20:07,791
In the light.

430
00:20:07,875 --> 00:20:09,875
All I can see is you.

431
00:20:11,166 --> 00:20:19,125
I love you, so deeply,
So hopelessly, and yet--

432
00:20:19,208 --> 00:20:22,666
I will not ever allow myself
to love a human woman.

433
00:20:32,875 --> 00:20:34,375
It's so cold!

434
00:20:35,791 --> 00:20:38,875
It wasn't snowing earlier so I
guess this means I made it into

435
00:20:38,958 --> 00:20:40,875
the past with no problem.

436
00:20:40,958 --> 00:20:42,750
Uh Mizuki?

437
00:20:42,833 --> 00:20:43,750
You there?

438
00:20:43,833 --> 00:20:44,625
Poor thing.

439
00:20:44,708 --> 00:20:46,125
You must be freezing out here.

440
00:20:46,208 --> 00:20:47,250
What?

441
00:20:47,333 --> 00:20:49,541
This kazuki cloak
will keep you warm.

442
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:52,875
I'll make you a deal.

443
00:20:52,958 --> 00:20:55,125
Give me the Dragon King's
eye inside you and in return,

444
00:20:55,208 --> 00:20:57,458
I will give you my warm cloak.

445
00:20:59,208 --> 00:21:00,291
Nanami?

446
00:21:04,541 --> 00:21:05,833
There you are!

447
00:21:05,916 --> 00:21:07,250
Please don't go wandering off.

448
00:21:07,333 --> 00:21:09,416
It's dangerous out here.

449
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:11,916
But there was a woman
standing here a second ago.

450
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:12,791
Yes, I know.

451
00:21:12,875 --> 00:21:14,541
That was a yokai named Isohime.

452
00:21:14,625 --> 00:21:16,875
She can often be found waiting
by the seashore for lost

453
00:21:16,958 --> 00:21:18,666
and vulnerable humans.

454
00:21:20,208 --> 00:21:21,291
There you go.

455
00:21:21,375 --> 00:21:23,791
Now shouldn't you be out
looking for Tomoe?

456
00:21:23,875 --> 00:21:24,458
Yes!

457
00:21:24,541 --> 00:21:25,083
I have to go.

458
00:21:25,166 --> 00:21:26,375
Thank you!

459
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:39,250
Tomoe!

460
00:21:43,583 --> 00:21:46,500
How dare you raid our palace
and steal the Dragon King's

461
00:21:46,583 --> 00:21:47,625
right eye?

462
00:21:47,708 --> 00:21:50,125
You will return it
to us this instant!

463
00:21:57,875 --> 00:22:00,666
Unfortunately, I do not
have time for that today.

464
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,500
The same face.

465
00:22:10,583 --> 00:22:12,166
The same voice.

466
00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:14,625
Tomoe, is it you?

467
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:16,750
Yes it is.

468
00:22:18,041 --> 00:22:20,541
You're the one who has my heart.

469
00:22:20,625 --> 00:22:22,208
I won't give up on you.

470
00:22:28,125 --> 00:22:29,208
Miss Nanami.

471
00:22:30,625 --> 00:22:31,750
Promise.

472
00:22:31,833 --> 00:22:34,166
Promise me that you
will look after Tomoe.

473
00:23:47,375 --> 00:23:48,666
Nanami and Mizuki traveled

474
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:51,541
to the past in search of
the Dragon King's right eye.

475
00:23:51,625 --> 00:23:54,041
Once there, they find Tomoe
and a beautiful woman.

476
00:23:54,125 --> 00:23:54,750
Who is she?

477
00:23:54,833 --> 00:23:56,208
Will Nanami recover?

478
00:23:56,291 --> 00:23:59,000
Next time, "The God Goes To
The Dragon King's Palace."

479
00:23:59,083 --> 00:24:01,500
Her beauty's too great to
do justice in a painting.
