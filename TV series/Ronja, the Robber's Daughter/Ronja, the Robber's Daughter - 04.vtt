- [Narrator] Exploring the
forest for the first time,

00:01:46.802 --> 00:01:49.172 position:24% line:83% align:start
Ronja learned that
it's not only fun,

00:01:49.205 --> 00:01:52.177 position:24% line:83% align:start
but it can also be
a frightening place.

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:54.546 position:7% line:89% align:start
Not all creatures were gentle.

00:01:54.579 --> 00:01:57.184 position:27% line:83% align:start
Lovis taught her
not to be afraid,

00:01:57.217 --> 00:01:59.019 position:16% line:89% align:start
but that takes practice.

00:01:59.053 --> 00:02:00.855 position:16% line:89% align:start
Mattis came to her rescue

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:04.493 position:19% line:83% align:start
and soon Ronja grew to
be afraid of nothing.

00:02:09.802 --> 00:02:12.205 position:33% line:89% align:start
(soft music)

00:02:18.647 --> 00:02:21.484 position:27% line:89% align:start
(birds squawking)

00:02:25.291 --> 00:02:28.028 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Ronja grunting)

00:02:41.948 --> 00:02:45.252 position:16% line:89% align:start
(Ronja breathing heavily)

00:02:52.629 --> 00:02:56.035 position:30% line:83% align:start
- I'll be back
tomorrow, my forest.

00:03:09.354 --> 00:03:10.555 position:33% line:89% align:start
Wait for me.

00:03:13.793 --> 00:03:14.895 position:33% line:89% align:start
Welcome home.

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:17.865 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Ronja giggling)

00:03:17.899 --> 00:03:22.238 position:21% line:83% align:start
- Hey Ronja, have you
seen what we've got?

00:03:22.272 --> 00:03:25.209 position:24% line:83% align:start
- Wow, look at all
the stuff you found.

00:03:27.679 --> 00:03:30.284 position:24% line:83% align:start
- And the soldiers
that got in our way

00:03:30.317 --> 00:03:33.254 position:10% line:89% align:start
we sent them packing, right?

00:03:33.288 --> 00:03:34.055 position:41% line:89% align:start
- Sure.

00:03:35.291 --> 00:03:36.892 position:27% line:83% align:start
- Why would they
get in your way?

00:03:36.926 --> 00:03:39.297 position:10% line:89% align:start
You didn't do anything wrong.

00:03:42.234 --> 00:03:44.069 position:19% line:89% align:start
- Well it's because...

00:03:45.004 --> 00:03:47.208 position:7% line:89% align:start
- Yeah, it's because of the...

00:03:48.443 --> 00:03:52.181 position:21% line:83% align:start
- Ronja, why does it
rain in the springtime?

00:03:57.989 --> 00:03:59.258 position:10% line:89% align:start
- It's natural that it rains

00:03:59.291 --> 00:04:02.829 position:21% line:83% align:start
but I've never given
it any thought.

00:04:02.863 --> 00:04:06.368 position:21% line:83% align:start
- Then why do Harpies
attack people?

00:04:06.401 --> 00:04:08.138 position:13% line:89% align:start
- That's the way they are.

00:04:08.171 --> 00:04:10.407 position:24% line:83% align:start
Can't stop the rain
or the Harpies.

00:04:10.441 --> 00:04:13.011 position:10% line:89% align:start
- Well, it's the same for us.

00:04:13.044 --> 00:04:17.016 position:19% line:83% align:start
Borka's Robbers always
try to snatch what's ours,

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:19.954 position:21% line:83% align:start
and the soldiers will
always try to fight us.

00:04:19.988 --> 00:04:22.091 position:13% line:89% align:start
That's just the way it is.

00:04:23.225 --> 00:04:25.195 position:30% line:89% align:start
- I understand.

00:04:25.228 --> 00:04:27.899 position:10% line:89% align:start
- [Fjosok] I knew you would.

00:04:27.932 --> 00:04:29.468 position:30% line:89% align:start
- [Ronja] Yep.

00:04:29.501 --> 00:04:31.871 position:19% line:83% align:start
- [Lill-Klippen] That's
right it's like the rain.

00:04:31.905 --> 00:04:34.842 position:10% line:83% align:start
- [Sturkas] And the Harpies,
Very clever, Fjosok.

00:04:34.875 --> 00:04:37.846 position:30% line:89% align:start
(men laughing)

00:04:37.879 --> 00:04:40.250 position:33% line:89% align:start
(soft music)

00:05:00.111 --> 00:05:03.249 position:21% line:83% align:start
- Do you feel bad for
that scoundrel Borka?

00:05:03.282 --> 00:05:05.419 position:10% line:89% align:start
I almost feel sorry for him.

00:05:06.454 --> 00:05:07.288 position:41% line:89% align:start
- Why?

00:05:11.161 --> 00:05:12.963 position:10% line:89% align:start
- The soldiers in the forest

00:05:14.232 --> 00:05:19.172 position:19% line:83% align:start
they will never give up
trying to hunt him down.

00:05:19.205 --> 00:05:21.976 position:19% line:83% align:start
- It's only a matter of
time before they smoke

00:05:22.009 --> 00:05:23.511 position:21% line:89% align:start
Borka out of his den.

00:05:26.882 --> 00:05:31.289 position:19% line:83% align:start
- I still haven't even
seen a single Borka Robber.

00:05:31.322 --> 00:05:33.125 position:21% line:89% align:start
- You're lucky then.

00:05:34.261 --> 00:05:37.498 position:27% line:83% align:start
- Yeah who wants
to see one of them.

00:05:37.531 --> 00:05:40.469 position:21% line:83% align:start
- They're all a bunch
of dirty devils.

00:05:40.502 --> 00:05:43.507 position:27% line:83% align:start
I can't wait for
Borka to get caught.

00:05:48.514 --> 00:05:50.384 position:21% line:89% align:start
On the other hand...

00:05:53.855 --> 00:05:55.123 position:27% line:89% align:start
- Don't be soft.

00:05:56.325 --> 00:05:58.461 position:19% line:83% align:start
That scoundrel wouldn't
be any nicer to us

00:05:58.495 --> 00:06:01.465 position:7% line:89% align:start
if it was the other way around.

00:06:01.499 --> 00:06:02.301 position:41% line:89% align:start
- Yeah.

00:06:02.334 --> 00:06:03.302 position:30% line:89% align:start
- That's right.

00:06:03.335 --> 00:06:04.903 position:27% line:89% align:start
- They all stink.

00:06:06.306 --> 00:06:09.109 position:16% line:89% align:start
- Down with Borka's men.

00:06:09.143 --> 00:06:12.348 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Ronja giggling)

00:06:12.381 --> 00:06:15.085 position:19% line:83% align:start
- Well, I'm lucky that
I'm Mattis' daughter.

00:06:15.118 --> 00:06:17.388 position:21% line:83% align:start
Borka's Robbers are a
bunch of dirty devils,

00:06:17.422 --> 00:06:21.528 position:13% line:83% align:start
so I'm proud to be with all
of you in the Mattis clan.

00:06:28.304 --> 00:06:31.008 position:16% line:89% align:start
- That's too, too sweet.

00:06:31.041 --> 00:06:34.979 position:19% line:83% align:start
- And we'd do anything
for you, Ronja.

00:06:35.013 --> 00:06:36.549 position:21% line:89% align:start
- We'd die for Ronja.

00:06:39.953 --> 00:06:41.490 position:13% line:89% align:start
- Yeah and we felt that way

00:06:41.523 --> 00:06:44.294 position:30% line:83% align:start
ever since the
night she was born.

00:06:46.397 --> 00:06:49.234 position:33% line:83% align:start
- My daughter
arrived with a bang.

00:06:50.603 --> 00:06:53.172 position:10% line:89% align:start
I'll never forget that night.

00:06:53.206 --> 00:06:55.442 position:27% line:83% align:start
The storm was so
loud with lightning

00:06:55.476 --> 00:06:57.646 position:10% line:89% align:start
that split our castle in two.

00:06:59.682 --> 00:07:02.653 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Ronja giggling)

00:07:02.687 --> 00:07:04.389 position:24% line:89% align:start
- That story again.

00:07:06.492 --> 00:07:08.361 position:19% line:89% align:start
- It's always that one

00:07:08.395 --> 00:07:11.465 position:21% line:83% align:start
especially when he's
had a bit to drink.

00:07:16.038 --> 00:07:20.445 position:16% line:83% align:start
- Ronja, can you remember
what I warned you about?

00:07:20.478 --> 00:07:23.282 position:24% line:83% align:start
- Be careful not to
fall into Hell's Gap

00:07:23.315 --> 00:07:25.285 position:21% line:89% align:start
no matter what I do.

00:07:25.318 --> 00:07:26.253 position:33% line:89% align:start
- Of course.

00:07:28.590 --> 00:07:34.131 position:7% line:83% align:start
Even with Hell's Gap this fort
is safer than any fox's den.

00:07:34.165 --> 00:07:37.469 position:24% line:83% align:start
I pity the soldiers
who dare to come here.

00:07:41.007 --> 00:07:44.012 position:21% line:83% align:start
- If they do they'll
be blown out to sea.

00:07:44.045 --> 00:07:46.482 position:19% line:83% align:start
(Noddle-Pete grunting)
(Noddle-Pete farting loudly)

00:07:46.515 --> 00:07:50.288 position:13% line:89% align:start
(everyone laughing loudly)

00:07:50.321 --> 00:07:51.522 position:16% line:89% align:start
- No one can get up here.

00:07:51.556 --> 00:07:52.691 position:27% line:89% align:start
We're on a cliff.

00:07:52.724 --> 00:07:54.461 position:19% line:89% align:start
- He's right you know.

00:07:54.494 --> 00:07:56.664 position:16% line:89% align:start
It's impossible to climb.

00:07:56.697 --> 00:07:58.767 position:30% line:83% align:start
- There's sheer
cliffs all around.

00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:00.502 position:30% line:89% align:start
- You're right.

00:08:00.535 --> 00:08:03.005 position:10% line:89% align:start
- They'll never get up here.

00:08:04.374 --> 00:08:07.713 position:24% line:83% align:start
- Let them try and
get past Wolf Valley.

00:08:14.522 --> 00:08:18.060 position:19% line:89% align:start
(wind whistling softly)

00:08:22.434 --> 00:08:23.468 position:38% line:89% align:start
Release.

00:08:25.438 --> 00:08:26.539 position:30% line:89% align:start
(man grunting)

00:08:26.572 --> 00:08:29.477 position:27% line:89% align:start

(soldiers coughing)

00:08:44.331 --> 00:08:46.501 position:10% line:89% align:start
- [Knotas] One, two, three...

00:08:48.538 --> 00:08:51.408 position:13% line:89% align:start
- [Robber] One, two, and...

00:08:51.441 --> 00:08:54.412 position:21% line:89% align:start
(soldiers screaming)

00:08:56.282 --> 00:08:59.152 position:24% line:83% align:start
- You got away with
your lives this time.

00:08:59.185 --> 00:09:02.123 position:10% line:89% align:start
Keep away from Mattis' fort.

00:09:02.156 --> 00:09:06.362 position:19% line:83% align:start
You'll regret it if you
ever set foot in here again.

00:09:06.396 --> 00:09:07.364 position:30% line:89% align:start
- That's right.

00:09:08.365 --> 00:09:09.701 position:27% line:89% align:start
Out of our fort.

00:09:11.470 --> 00:09:12.572 position:27% line:89% align:start
(bones cracking)

00:09:12.605 --> 00:09:15.777 position:19% line:89% align:start
(Noddle-Pete groaning)

00:09:17.846 --> 00:09:21.116 position:21% line:83% align:start
- Noddle-Pete, what's
wrong with you?

00:09:22.319 --> 00:09:25.524 position:21% line:83% align:start
- Well, I make weird
noises when I get up.

00:09:25.557 --> 00:09:28.494 position:13% line:89% align:start
I'm just getting a bit old.

00:09:28.528 --> 00:09:33.268 position:7% line:83% align:start
Once upon a time I could catch
anything in Mattis' forest.

00:09:33.301 --> 00:09:34.135 position:35% line:89% align:start
Oh, got it.

00:09:35.471 --> 00:09:37.507 position:16% line:89% align:start
That was a long time ago.

00:09:38.609 --> 00:09:40.678 position:16% line:89% align:start
Now all I catch is fleas.

00:09:48.624 --> 00:09:51.393 position:27% line:83% align:start
- And that's time
for bed, Ronja.

00:09:55.900 --> 00:09:57.669 position:21% line:89% align:start
- [Ronja] Good night.

00:10:01.708 --> 00:10:05.179 position:19% line:89% align:start

to Joen and Knotas?

I gave birth to you on
such a stormy night.

00:13:14.050 --> 00:13:17.554 position:16% line:83% align:start
Those awful harpies were
circling above the fort.

00:13:17.588 --> 00:13:20.625 position:13% line:83% align:start
Now some say that children
born on a night like that

00:13:20.659 --> 00:13:22.695 position:16% line:89% align:start
can turn wild and savage.

00:13:24.531 --> 00:13:27.602 position:21% line:83% align:start
Anyway, do watch the
skies for harpies?

00:13:28.837 --> 00:13:31.440 position:10% line:89% align:start
I don't want you carried off.

00:13:32.742 --> 00:13:34.779 position:27% line:89% align:start

of all the things in the forest.

00:13:39.619 --> 00:13:42.023 position:16% line:89% align:start
- Yes, be extra careful,

00:13:42.057 --> 00:13:44.927 position:19% line:83% align:start
because the harpies go
from bad to even worse

00:13:44.961 --> 00:13:47.631 position:10% line:89% align:start
when the weather turns cold.

00:16:37.473 --> 00:16:40.744 position:21% line:83% align:start

warned about them.

00:17:55.985 --> 00:17:59.991 position:13% line:83% align:start
There must be a better way
to practice being brave.

00:18:00.024 --> 00:18:01.192 position:30% line:89% align:start
I have an idea.

00:18:13.377 --> 00:18:15.879 position:7% line:89% align:start
- I wonder what Ronja's up to.

00:18:18.217 --> 00:18:20.554 position:13% line:89% align:start

00:20:52.737 --> 00:20:53.839 position:33% line:89% align:start
- Hell's Gap.

00:20:56.510 --> 00:20:58.746 position:10% line:89% align:start
What was it that Mattis said?

00:21:00.315 --> 00:21:01.817 position:19% line:89% align:start
- It's very important.

00:21:01.850 --> 00:21:03.787 position:16% line:89% align:start
Now what did I just say?

00:21:05.690 --> 00:21:10.128 position:16% line:83% align:start
- To watch out and do not
fall down into Hell's Gap.

00:21:53.724 --> 00:21:55.794 position:16% line:89% align:start
Ronja, you can jump this.

00:22:02.971 --> 00:22:05.274 position:16% line:89% align:start
No not here it's too far.

00:22:15.823 --> 00:22:18.192 position:13% line:89% align:start
I can make it across here.

- [Narrator] Ronja
knew that she wasn't

00:22:37.654 --> 00:22:39.724 position:10% line:89% align:start
the only child in the world.

00:22:39.757 --> 00:22:41.760 position:27% line:83% align:start
But having never
seen another child,

00:22:41.793 --> 00:22:44.864 position:19% line:83% align:start
she did believe she was
the only one in the forest.

00:22:44.897 --> 00:22:48.435 position:7% line:83% align:start
Her mother Lovis told her there
were two types of children:

00:22:48.469 --> 00:22:51.440 position:16% line:83% align:start
those who would turn into
Mattises when they grew big,

00:22:51.474 --> 00:22:53.977 position:24% line:83% align:start
and those who would
turn into Lovises.

00:22:54.010 --> 00:22:57.281 position:24% line:83% align:start
Ronja herself would
turn into a Lovis.

00:22:57.315 --> 00:23:00.887 position:7% line:83% align:start
But she knew that the child on
the other side of Hell's Gap

00:23:00.920 --> 00:23:02.923 position:16% line:89% align:start
would turn into a Mattis.

00:23:02.957 --> 00:23:04.960 position:16% line:89% align:start
- Hey robber's daughter,

00:23:04.993 --> 00:23:06.863 position:21% line:89% align:start
I know you, yes I do.

00:23:08.831 --> 00:23:10.734 position:16% line:89% align:start
