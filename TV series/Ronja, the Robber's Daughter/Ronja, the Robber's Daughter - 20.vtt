- If you remember
brother, you had it last!

00:01:44.246 --> 00:01:47.217 position:13% line:83% align:start
- [Narrator] Ronja and Birk
fought over a lost knife,

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.486 position:19% line:89% align:start
each blaming the other.

00:01:49.519 --> 00:01:51.988 position:21% line:83% align:start
But after rescuing an
injured wild horse,

00:01:52.022 --> 00:01:53.457 position:24% line:89% align:start
they soon made up.

00:01:57.227 --> 00:01:59.764 position:24% line:83% align:start
Friends once again,
Birk told Ronja

00:01:59.797 --> 00:02:03.634 position:19% line:83% align:start
that she was worth more
than a thousand knives.

00:02:23.121 --> 00:02:24.457 position:27% line:89% align:start
The days passed.

00:02:25.825 --> 00:02:28.027 position:16% line:89% align:start
Spring turned to summer.

00:02:29.095 --> 00:02:31.030 position:21% line:89% align:start
The weather was warm.

00:02:34.768 --> 00:02:37.705 position:27% line:89% align:start
(birds chirping)

00:02:55.825 --> 00:02:59.427 position:16% line:89% align:start
(rain drops splattering)

00:03:06.469 --> 00:03:08.037 position:24% line:89% align:start
Then the rain came.

00:03:09.806 --> 00:03:14.176 position:19% line:83% align:start
For days and nights it
poured down over the forest,

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:21.051 position:16% line:83% align:start
which drank itself fresh
and green as never before.

00:03:24.454 --> 00:03:28.191 position:10% line:89% align:start
(uplifting orchestral music)

00:03:58.224 --> 00:04:00.160 position:13% line:89% align:start
And when the rain moved on,

00:04:00.193 --> 00:04:02.195 position:10% line:89% align:start
and the sun came back again,

00:04:02.228 --> 00:04:04.865 position:24% line:83% align:start
the forest steamed
in the summer heat.

00:04:12.206 --> 00:04:14.275 position:24% line:83% align:start
They both felt that
no forest on earth

00:04:14.308 --> 00:04:16.310 position:13% line:89% align:start
could smell quite as sweet.

00:04:29.459 --> 00:04:30.292 position:41% line:89% align:start
- Lia!

00:04:32.695 --> 00:04:35.131 position:35% line:89% align:start
- Ho, Lia!

00:04:41.572 --> 00:04:44.207 position:33% line:89% align:start
(Lia neighs)

00:04:53.585 --> 00:04:55.587 position:16% line:89% align:start
- There isn't much milk.

00:05:00.692 --> 00:05:03.428 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Ronja slurping)

00:05:11.303 --> 00:05:13.906 position:30% line:89% align:start
(horse neighs)

00:05:13.939 --> 00:05:15.207 position:27% line:89% align:start
Villain, Savage!

00:05:22.349 --> 00:05:25.185 position:27% line:89% align:start
(horses neighing)

00:05:27.487 --> 00:05:29.757 position:21% line:89% align:start
Hey Villain, Savage.

00:05:30.692 --> 00:05:33.326 position:24% line:89% align:start
Go away now, go on.

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:37.298 position:19% line:83% align:start
All you're good for is
causing trouble for us.

00:05:37.331 --> 00:05:39.667 position:30% line:89% align:start
(horses snort)

00:05:41.937 --> 00:05:44.439 position:33% line:89% align:start
(Birk laughs)

00:05:46.608 --> 00:05:48.544 position:24% line:83% align:start
- The other horses
must be wondering,

00:05:48.577 --> 00:05:49.912 position:27% line:89% align:start
what is he doing?

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:53.917 position:24% line:83% align:start
I bet they've never
seen this before.

00:06:07.998 --> 00:06:10.533 position:19% line:83% align:start
- I always promised I'd
take you for a ride.

00:06:10.568 --> 00:06:11.669 position:30% line:89% align:start
So here we go!

00:06:20.045 --> 00:06:22.279 position:30% line:89% align:start
(horse neighs)

00:06:22.313 --> 00:06:24.983 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Ronja grunting)

00:06:40.733 --> 00:06:43.436 position:30% line:89% align:start
(Ronja screams)

00:06:43.469 --> 00:06:45.705 position:33% line:89% align:start
(Ronja thuds)

00:06:57.551 --> 00:06:59.888 position:10% line:89% align:start
Then again, maybe not today.

00:07:05.627 --> 00:07:07.862 position:27% line:83% align:start
Villain by name,
villain by nature.

00:07:07.896 --> 00:07:10.365 position:10% line:89% align:start
But I will ride you one day!

00:07:14.637 --> 00:07:16.806 position:27% line:89% align:start
They'll be back.

00:07:16.839 --> 00:07:18.374 position:24% line:89% align:start
I will not give up!

00:07:26.116 --> 00:07:29.486 position:5% line:89% align:start
- [Narrator] And Ronja was back.

00:07:29.519 --> 00:07:31.555 position:13% line:89% align:start
Each day after milking Lia,

00:07:31.588 --> 00:07:33.557 position:10% line:89% align:start
Ronja and Birk tried to teach

00:07:33.590 --> 00:07:35.759 position:24% line:83% align:start
Villain and Savage
better manners.

00:07:35.792 --> 00:07:37.661 position:21% line:83% align:start
- Much better, you're
getting better.

00:07:37.694 --> 00:07:39.964 position:30% line:83% align:start
Much more calm
and you're peaceful.

00:07:39.997 --> 00:07:44.101 position:30% line:83% align:start
(horse neighs)
(Ronja thuds)

00:07:48.907 --> 00:07:50.408 position:24% line:89% align:start
Please understand.

00:07:51.409 --> 00:07:53.779 position:16% line:89% align:start
You've got to calm down.

00:07:53.812 --> 00:07:57.349 position:24% line:83% align:start
Yes, like this, but
with me on your back.

00:07:59.118 --> 00:08:01.988 position:30% line:89% align:start
(horse neighs)

00:08:08.428 --> 00:08:11.998 position:5% line:89% align:start
Yes, this is much calmer, great!

00:08:21.175 --> 00:08:23.510 position:21% line:83% align:start
- [Birk] What do you
think of my elbow?

00:08:23.544 --> 00:08:25.412 position:7% line:89% align:start
- It's not as bad as this one.

00:08:25.446 --> 00:08:26.014 position:38% line:89% align:start
Or this.

00:08:26.914 --> 00:08:29.383 position:35% line:89% align:start
(laughing)

00:08:39.794 --> 00:08:42.164 position:30% line:89% align:start
(horse neighs)

00:08:45.768 --> 00:08:48.437 position:30% line:89% align:start
(playful music)

00:09:09.894 --> 00:09:11.496 position:24% line:83% align:start
- [Narrator] But no
amount of teaching worked

00:09:11.529 --> 00:09:13.564 position:19% line:89% align:start
on those wicked beasts.

00:09:20.272 --> 00:09:22.540 position:21% line:83% align:start
- Well there's not a
single part of my body

00:09:22.573 --> 00:09:23.609 position:24% line:89% align:start
that doesn't hurt,

00:09:23.642 --> 00:09:24.643 position:16% line:89% align:start
and it's all your fault.

00:09:24.677 --> 00:09:25.644 position:30% line:89% align:start
Do you hear me?

00:09:25.678 --> 00:09:27.479 position:21% line:89% align:start
It's because of you.

00:09:28.614 --> 00:09:30.015 position:35% line:89% align:start
Stop that.

00:09:31.217 --> 00:09:33.219 position:30% line:89% align:start
- Ronja, look!

00:09:37.524 --> 00:09:38.258 position:24% line:89% align:start
Would you believe?

00:09:38.291 --> 00:09:40.460 position:19% line:89% align:start
I've trained my horse!

00:09:43.264 --> 00:09:46.233 position:24% line:83% align:start
You're truly a good
boy, aren't ya?

00:09:46.267 --> 00:09:48.602 position:7% line:89% align:start
The finest horse in the forest.

00:09:48.636 --> 00:09:50.104 position:13% line:89% align:start
And you're second to none.

00:09:50.137 --> 00:09:51.138 position:33% line:89% align:start
Good boy, eh?

00:09:52.907 --> 00:09:55.476 position:30% line:89% align:start
(Ronja growls)

00:09:56.577 --> 00:09:58.180 position:30% line:89% align:start
- Finest horse.

00:09:58.213 --> 00:10:01.016 position:19% line:83% align:start
You can bet he's still
a savage in his heart.

00:10:01.049 --> 00:10:03.819 position:27% line:89% align:start
(thunder rumbles)

00:10:09.624 --> 00:10:12.862 position:16% line:89% align:start
(Ronja and Birk panting)

00:10:18.835 --> 00:10:21.504 position:30% line:89% align:start
(Ronja snoring)

00:10:29.346 --> 00:10:32.217 position:30% line:89% align:start
(playful music)

00:10:42.193 --> 00:10:43.329 position:30% line:89% align:start
It's annoying.

00:10:43.362 --> 00:10:47.532 position:19% line:83% align:start
He keeps riding off and
leaving me alone to milk you.

00:11:02.382 --> 00:11:04.718 position:21% line:83% align:start
I can't bear to look
at his smug face.

00:11:04.751 --> 00:11:07.254 position:30% line:89% align:start
(horse neighs)

00:11:17.331 --> 00:11:20.134 position:30% line:89% align:start
(Birk giggles)

00:11:22.670 --> 00:11:24.306 position:24% line:89% align:start
- [Birk] Hiya, get!

00:11:24.339 --> 00:11:26.975 position:24% line:83% align:start
- When I'm finished
with this I'll show you.

00:11:27.009 --> 00:11:31.113 position:19% line:83% align:start
Then you'll really see
some riding. (scoffs)

00:11:38.254 --> 00:11:40.823 position:30% line:89% align:start
(horse neighs)

00:11:50.134 --> 00:11:50.967 position:38% line:89% align:start
- Ronja!

00:11:52.436 --> 00:11:53.337 position:35% line:89% align:start
After them!

00:11:55.039 --> 00:11:59.043 position:7% line:89% align:start
(Ronja grunting and screaming)

00:11:59.076 --> 00:12:03.181 position:7% line:83% align:start
- I don't know how much longer
I can hold on! (screams)

00:12:18.164 --> 00:12:20.166 position:16% line:89% align:start
- Don't you dare let go.

00:12:33.747 --> 00:12:34.381 position:47% line:89% align:start
Go!

00:12:43.224 --> 00:12:44.058 position:44% line:89% align:start
Woah!

00:13:00.809 --> 00:13:03.679 position:30% line:89% align:start
(horse panting)

00:13:04.414 --> 00:13:05.848 position:19% line:89% align:start
- I bet you loved that.

00:13:05.881 --> 00:13:09.152 position:24% line:83% align:start
You really ran well
today, good boy.

00:13:09.186 --> 00:13:10.120 position:38% line:89% align:start
Hold on.

00:13:10.153 --> 00:13:11.354 position:33% line:89% align:start
Naughty boy.

00:13:11.388 --> 00:13:13.990 position:24% line:83% align:start
I should be telling
you off, shouldn't I?

00:13:14.024 --> 00:13:15.392 position:16% line:89% align:start
You could have thrown me.

00:13:15.425 --> 00:13:16.893 position:13% line:89% align:start
It's a miracle you didn't.

00:13:16.927 --> 00:13:19.263 position:38% line:89% align:start
(laughs)

00:13:19.297 --> 00:13:20.730 position:19% line:89% align:start
- It's a bigger miracle

00:13:20.764 --> 00:13:23.901 position:27% line:83% align:start
we're both riding
these beautiful horses.

00:13:26.270 --> 00:13:28.039 position:33% line:83% align:start
Of course now
these wicked beasts

00:13:28.072 --> 00:13:30.241 position:13% line:89% align:start
should do just what we say.

00:13:31.776 --> 00:13:34.346 position:27% line:83% align:start
- Villain, have I
really tamed you?

00:13:34.379 --> 00:13:35.147 position:41% line:89% align:start
Have I?

00:13:36.081 --> 00:13:38.817 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Villain snorts)

00:14:07.915 --> 00:14:08.450 position:38% line:89% align:start
Hey Birk.

00:14:09.917 --> 00:14:12.953 position:21% line:83% align:start
Have you noticed that
Lia's giving less milk?

00:14:12.987 --> 00:14:15.023 position:24% line:83% align:start
I'm worried there's
something wrong with her.

00:14:15.056 --> 00:14:17.459 position:10% line:89% align:start
- Hm, it's that time of year.

00:14:17.492 --> 00:14:21.397 position:19% line:83% align:start
She probably has a new
foal on the way now.

00:14:21.430 --> 00:14:24.367 position:27% line:83% align:start
And soon she will
dry up altogether.

00:14:26.035 --> 00:14:27.570 position:30% line:89% align:start
- No more milk.

00:14:27.603 --> 00:14:30.373 position:21% line:83% align:start
Well I guess it will
be spring water for us.

00:14:30.406 --> 00:14:34.511 position:13% line:83% align:start
And we'll soon be having to
manage without bread as well.

00:14:38.848 --> 00:14:40.550 position:27% line:83% align:start
- So even without
bread or Lia's milk,

00:14:40.584 --> 00:14:44.388 position:27% line:83% align:start
there's no chance
that we'll starve.

00:14:44.421 --> 00:14:46.390 position:13% line:89% align:start
The forest is full of food.

00:14:46.424 --> 00:14:49.594 position:16% line:89% align:start
Fish, rabbits, and birds.

00:14:49.627 --> 00:14:51.296 position:10% line:89% align:start
And we have the green leaves

00:14:51.329 --> 00:14:53.931 position:5% line:89% align:start
and the herbs you picked for us.

00:14:59.203 --> 00:15:00.938 position:41% line:89% align:start
(sighs)

00:15:00.972 --> 00:15:02.474 position:27% line:89% align:start
- No, maybe not.

00:15:02.508 --> 00:15:04.510 position:13% line:89% align:start
We might not starve, but...

00:15:07.946 --> 00:15:11.917 position:13% line:83% align:start
I tell you, those first few
days without bread or milk,

00:15:11.950 --> 00:15:15.188 position:24% line:83% align:start
they're going to be
absolutely impossible!

00:15:19.893 --> 00:15:24.064 position:13% line:83% align:start
- [Narrator] That day came
sooner than they had expected.

00:15:25.599 --> 00:15:28.336 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Ronja slurping)

00:15:30.003 --> 00:15:30.837 position:41% line:89% align:start
- Well?

00:15:32.606 --> 00:15:35.276 position:24% line:83% align:start
- No more than two
or three drops.

00:15:35.309 --> 00:15:36.077 position:38% line:89% align:start
- I see.

00:15:39.246 --> 00:15:40.047 position:44% line:89% align:start
Lia?

00:15:41.283 --> 00:15:43.952 position:19% line:83% align:start
I want to thank you for
all you've given us.

00:15:43.985 --> 00:15:45.387 position:30% line:89% align:start
Come next year,

00:15:45.420 --> 00:15:48.290 position:21% line:83% align:start
you'll have your own
little baby to look after.

00:15:48.323 --> 00:15:49.091 position:41% line:89% align:start
A foal.

00:15:51.527 --> 00:15:54.297 position:27% line:83% align:start
Then you'll have
lots of milk again.

00:15:54.330 --> 00:15:59.669 position:10% line:83% align:start
But remember, it will be for
your baby, not for us two.

00:15:59.703 --> 00:16:02.238 position:10% line:89% align:start
You'll have your own family.

00:16:06.710 --> 00:16:08.911 position:7% line:89% align:start
You must also thank her, Birk.

00:16:08.945 --> 00:16:10.447 position:24% line:89% align:start
- Of course I will.

00:16:15.219 --> 00:16:16.621 position:27% line:89% align:start
I thank you, Lia.

00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:24.429 position:27% line:89% align:start
Now, you must go.

00:16:30.403 --> 00:16:32.170 position:41% line:83% align:start
- Bye!
- Bye!

00:17:07.676 --> 00:17:08.510 position:41% line:89% align:start
- Wow.

00:17:22.191 --> 00:17:25.128 position:35% line:89% align:start
(laughing)

00:17:25.161 --> 00:17:27.730 position:30% line:83% align:start
Well then, the
great greedy falls.

00:17:29.165 --> 00:17:30.701 position:16% line:89% align:start
- If we were to fall in,

00:17:30.734 --> 00:17:33.504 position:21% line:83% align:start
that would definitely
be the end of you and I.

00:17:35.205 --> 00:17:37.441 position:35% line:89% align:start
(laughing)

00:17:39.810 --> 00:17:42.513 position:33% line:89% align:start
(harpy calls)

00:17:43.782 --> 00:17:45.617 position:10% line:89% align:start
- [Harpy] Look what I found.

00:17:45.650 --> 00:17:48.052 position:21% line:89% align:start
Lovely little humans.

00:17:48.085 --> 00:17:49.721 position:19% line:89% align:start
Now the blood will run.

00:17:51.490 --> 00:17:53.725 position:35% line:83% align:start
- A harpy!
- Quick!

00:17:53.758 --> 00:17:54.526 position:47% line:89% align:start
Ya!

00:18:00.298 --> 00:18:03.001 position:33% line:89% align:start
(harpy calls)

00:18:05.338 --> 00:18:08.174 position:27% line:89% align:start
(harpy screeches)

00:18:10.343 --> 00:18:12.613 position:24% line:83% align:start
- Ronja, jump off!
- Right!

00:18:23.858 --> 00:18:25.593 position:30% line:89% align:start
- Don't worry.

00:18:25.627 --> 00:18:29.130 position:7% line:83% align:start
There's a reason harpies don't
attack beasts of the forest.

00:18:29.163 --> 00:18:32.267 position:21% line:83% align:start
- It's only us humans
that they want to attack.

00:18:32.300 --> 00:18:36.404 position:24% line:83% align:start
(harpy screeching)
(Birk and Ronja gasp)

00:18:49.418 --> 00:18:51.354 position:24% line:89% align:start
- [Birk] Hey, hey!

00:18:51.388 --> 00:18:54.157 position:27% line:89% align:start
(harpy screeches)

00:18:55.859 --> 00:18:58.796 position:27% line:89% align:start
(dramatic music)

00:19:01.231 --> 00:19:03.133 position:30% line:89% align:start
- Where is she?

00:19:03.166 --> 00:19:06.804 position:30% line:83% align:start
The lovely girl
with the black hair?

00:19:06.837 --> 00:19:08.639 position:24% line:89% align:start
Come out, children!

00:19:10.808 --> 00:19:14.746 position:19% line:83% align:start
Ah, there's the little
human with the red hair!

00:19:19.585 --> 00:19:21.753 position:27% line:89% align:start
(harpy screeches)

00:19:21.787 --> 00:19:25.157 position:7% line:89% align:start
You can hide, but I will seek.

00:19:25.190 --> 00:19:27.594 position:21% line:89% align:start
And I will find you.

00:19:27.627 --> 00:19:31.698 position:21% line:83% align:start
And then you will be
clawed, clawed and shredded.

00:19:31.731 --> 00:19:33.600 position:30% line:89% align:start
Where are you?!

00:19:38.338 --> 00:19:40.173 position:24% line:89% align:start
Despicable humans.

00:19:40.206 --> 00:19:43.276 position:19% line:83% align:start
I'll let all my lovely
sisters know about you.

00:19:43.310 --> 00:19:46.180 position:19% line:89% align:start
Then you will be found!

00:19:46.213 --> 00:19:49.149 position:24% line:89% align:start
(harpy screeching)

00:19:56.658 --> 00:19:57.492 position:38% line:89% align:start
- Ronja.

00:19:59.461 --> 00:20:00.295 position:41% line:89% align:start
Ronja?

00:20:05.668 --> 00:20:06.502 position:41% line:89% align:start
Ronja!

00:20:07.503 --> 00:20:08.336 position:41% line:89% align:start
- Birk!

00:20:11.841 --> 00:20:13.909 position:16% line:89% align:start
We got away, we survived!

00:20:15.611 --> 00:20:17.513 position:10% line:89% align:start
- We weren't clawed to death!

00:20:17.546 --> 00:20:21.818 position:19% line:83% align:start
Or carried up to their
caves in the mountains!

00:20:21.852 --> 00:20:25.188 position:13% line:83% align:start
- Although we shouldn't be
afraid of Mattis' forest.

00:20:25.222 --> 00:20:26.857 position:5% line:89% align:start
But with wild harpies screeching

00:20:26.890 --> 00:20:28.926 position:7% line:89% align:start
and flapping around your ears,

00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:31.294 position:19% line:89% align:start
who wouldn't be afraid?

00:20:31.328 --> 00:20:32.329 position:33% line:89% align:start
I was scared.

00:20:33.531 --> 00:20:35.700 position:38% line:89% align:start
(giggles)

00:20:36.868 --> 00:20:38.936 position:35% line:89% align:start
(laughing)

00:20:46.244 --> 00:20:51.250 position:13% line:83% align:start
I guess we rode the horses
further than we thought.

00:20:51.283 --> 00:20:53.218 position:19% line:89% align:start
- I don't care, do you?

00:20:53.252 --> 00:20:55.855 position:27% line:83% align:start
I could walk like
this all night long.

00:20:55.889 --> 00:20:58.858 position:19% line:83% align:start
As long as we don't see
any more wild harpies.

00:20:58.892 --> 00:21:01.528 position:19% line:83% align:start
- To tell you the truth
I'll never get used to them.

00:21:01.561 --> 00:21:03.329 position:24% line:89% align:start
They're terrifying.

00:21:03.363 --> 00:21:04.564 position:24% line:83% align:start
But even with them
flying around,

00:21:04.597 --> 00:21:06.466 position:24% line:83% align:start
I still think it's
wonderful here.

00:21:06.499 --> 00:21:08.234 position:19% line:89% align:start
- You're right, there.

00:21:08.268 --> 00:21:11.371 position:24% line:83% align:start
We get to be free,
and tame wild horses,

00:21:11.404 --> 00:21:13.808 position:13% line:89% align:start
and the weather is lovely.

00:21:13.841 --> 00:21:17.845 position:19% line:83% align:start
Day or night, under the
sun, or the moon, and stars!

00:21:17.878 --> 00:21:19.346 position:41% line:89% align:start
- Yes.

00:21:19.380 --> 00:21:20.982 position:24% line:89% align:start
But seasons change.

00:21:21.016 --> 00:21:23.652 position:5% line:89% align:start
I love it in the spring, summer.

00:21:23.685 --> 00:21:24.886 position:30% line:89% align:start
Autumn's great.

00:21:27.856 --> 00:21:28.790 position:35% line:89% align:start
But winter.

00:21:30.325 --> 00:21:33.261 position:24% line:89% align:start
(calm flute music)

00:21:41.304 --> 00:21:42.371 position:38% line:89% align:start
- Ronja!

00:22:02.426 --> 00:22:03.928 position:24% line:89% align:start
- The shadow folk.

00:22:04.829 --> 00:22:06.397 position:30% line:89% align:start
They carry on.

00:22:06.431 --> 00:22:09.701 position:21% line:83% align:start
All living cheerfully
in the wintertime.

00:22:11.871 --> 00:22:15.007 position:7% line:89% align:start
- Sister mine, it's summer now.

00:22:19.612 --> 00:22:20.880 position:41% line:89% align:start
- Yes.

00:22:20.913 --> 00:22:22.381 position:24% line:83% align:start
And I shall always
treasure the memory

00:22:22.414 --> 00:22:23.649 position:19% line:89% align:start
of this summer with you

00:22:23.682 --> 00:22:26.418 position:7% line:89% align:start
in my heart, as long as I live.

00:22:37.564 --> 00:22:39.432 position:21% line:89% align:start
- As long as I live.

00:22:40.902 --> 00:22:41.736 position:44% line:89% align:start
- Hm?

00:22:43.137 --> 00:22:45.373 position:21% line:83% align:start
- Yes, I shall carry
this summer in my heart

00:22:45.406 --> 00:22:49.510 position:19% line:83% align:start
for as long as I live,
and wherever I am.

00:22:49.544 --> 00:22:50.545 position:33% line:89% align:start
I know that.

00:22:56.451 --> 00:22:58.120 position:19% line:83% align:start
- [Narrator] When they
returned to the bear's cave,

00:22:58.154 --> 00:23:01.690 position:24% line:83% align:start
an unexpected guest
was waiting for them.

00:23:06.796 --> 00:23:08.464 position:21% line:89% align:start
- It's Lill-Klippen!

00:23:13.469 --> 00:23:15.438 position:24% line:83% align:start
- [Narrator] It was
Lill-Klippen,

00:23:15.471 --> 00:23:16.907 position:19% line:89% align:start
one of Mattis' robbers.

00:23:21.011 --> 00:23:22.780 position:27% line:89% align:start
(exciting music)

00:23:22.813 --> 00:23:26.383 position:24% line:83% align:start
Next time on Ronja,
the Robber's Daughter.

00:23:30.521 --> 00:23:32.023 position:21% line:89% align:start
"Hunted by Harpies".

00:23:34.426 --> 00:23:35.393 position:30% line:89% align:start
Don't miss it!

00:23:36.494 --> 00:23:39.397 position:21% line:89% align:start
(calm ambient music)
