00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:48.903 position:16% line:83% align:start
- [Narrator] For 10 years
Ronja's entire world

00:01:48.938 --> 00:01:53.871 position:13% line:83% align:start
was within the safe, stone
walls of Mattis' fort.

00:01:53.904 --> 00:01:58.805 position:13% line:83% align:start
When Mattis finally let her
explore the forest outside,

00:01:58.839 --> 00:02:01.040 position:24% line:83% align:start
she found the real
world to be far

00:02:01.073 --> 00:02:03.340 position:10% line:89% align:start
bigger than she had imagined.

00:02:03.373 --> 00:02:06.308 position:24% line:83% align:start
So big that it took
her breath away.

00:02:45.848 --> 00:02:48.015 position:38% line:89% align:start
(panting)

00:03:00.318 --> 00:03:02.751 position:35% line:89% align:start
(laughter)

00:03:06.052 --> 00:03:08.719 position:30% line:89% align:start
(gleeful shout)

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:13.221 position:30% line:89% align:start
(upbeat music)

00:03:18.422 --> 00:03:20.388 position:38% line:89% align:start
(giggles)

00:03:50.461 --> 00:03:51.827 position:30% line:89% align:start
- Who's there?

00:03:59.761 --> 00:04:00.929 position:38% line:89% align:start
Hi there!

00:04:28.301 --> 00:04:30.401 position:38% line:89% align:start
(inhale)

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:40.003 position:35% line:89% align:start
(giggling)

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:57.807 position:13% line:89% align:start
You're as big as the fort!

00:05:16.843 --> 00:05:19.311 position:30% line:89% align:start
(rushing water)

00:05:20.445 --> 00:05:22.011 position:44% line:89% align:start
Wow!

00:06:26.157 --> 00:06:28.657 position:7% line:89% align:start
I've never seen so much water!

00:06:36.025 --> 00:06:38.193 position:38% line:89% align:start
(tapping)

00:07:31.836 --> 00:07:33.303 position:44% line:89% align:start
Wow!

00:07:45.439 --> 00:07:47.906 position:19% line:83% align:start
This must be the place
Mattis told me about.

00:07:47.939 --> 00:07:50.072 position:19% line:89% align:start
So this is far enough.

00:07:57.141 --> 00:07:59.674 position:38% line:89% align:start
(giggle)

00:08:34.814 --> 00:08:35.448 position:38% line:89% align:start
Last one!

(yelling)

00:11:49.851 --> 00:11:51.786 position:19% line:89% align:start
It's a wonderful sound.

00:12:26.226 --> 00:12:27.392 position:30% line:89% align:start
- You're back!

00:12:28.460 --> 00:12:31.793 position:7% line:89% align:start
- That's quite a haul, Mattis!

00:12:31.826 --> 00:12:33.094 position:44% line:89% align:start
- Ho!

00:12:33.127 --> 00:12:34.494 position:27% line:89% align:start
Has Ronja passed?

00:12:35.794 --> 00:12:36.894 position:33% line:89% align:start
- Yes, Chief!

00:12:37.927 --> 00:12:39.395 position:21% line:89% align:start
- We saw her before!

00:12:40.962 --> 00:12:42.462 position:24% line:89% align:start
- Oh, that's good.

00:12:52.331 --> 00:12:54.931 position:7% line:89% align:start
Hang on, when exactly was that?

00:12:57.265 --> 00:12:58.098 position:35% line:89% align:start
- Earlier!

00:12:59.865 --> 00:13:00.932 position:21% line:89% align:start
- It was mid-morning.

00:13:00.966 --> 00:13:03.732 position:30% line:83% align:start
She ran past us
looking very happy!

00:13:07.367 --> 00:13:09.901 position:33% line:83% align:start
- What if she
hasn't returned home yet?

00:13:12.934 --> 00:13:15.202 position:35% line:89% align:start
(groaning)

00:13:16.202 --> 00:13:19.135 position:24% line:89% align:start
(mysterious music)

00:13:29.071 --> 00:13:30.371 position:30% line:89% align:start
Will you stop?

00:13:30.404 --> 00:13:31.938 position:5% line:89% align:start
You'll wear a hole in the floor.

00:13:31.972 --> 00:13:33.239 position:19% line:89% align:start
- How can you be calm?

00:13:33.272 --> 00:13:35.771 position:24% line:83% align:start
There's Harpies and
Gray Dwarves out there!

00:13:35.805 --> 00:13:38.939 position:21% line:83% align:start
- Come on, it's Ronja
we're talking about.

00:13:38.973 --> 00:13:40.340 position:21% line:89% align:start
She'll be all right.

00:13:49.242 --> 00:13:51.041 position:35% line:89% align:start
- Not home?

00:13:51.075 --> 00:13:51.842 position:35% line:89% align:start
- Not yet.

00:13:53.942 --> 00:13:55.875 position:41% line:89% align:start
(sigh)

00:14:22.947 --> 00:14:26.948 position:13% line:83% align:start
- Who can even think about
eating at a time like this?

00:14:26.982 --> 00:14:28.416 position:33% line:89% align:start
I'm worried.

00:14:28.450 --> 00:14:29.849 position:30% line:89% align:start
You're worried.

00:14:36.317 --> 00:14:38.050 position:21% line:89% align:start
- Even she's worried.

00:15:05.023 --> 00:15:07.357 position:10% line:89% align:start
- Oh no, I need to get home.

00:15:25.927 --> 00:15:26.760 position:41% line:89% align:start
My bag.

00:15:28.427 --> 00:15:29.827 position:27% line:89% align:start
It's on the rock!

00:15:54.132 --> 00:15:54.965 position:44% line:89% align:start
Wow.

00:16:00.233 --> 00:16:01.300 position:30% line:83% align:start
There's more to
this world

00:16:01.333 --> 00:16:02.267 position:30% line:89% align:start
than I thought.

00:16:12.935 --> 00:16:14.003 position:33% line:89% align:start
So much more.

00:16:54.610 --> 00:16:55.910 position:35% line:89% align:start
What is it?

00:16:55.944 --> 00:16:57.278 position:27% line:89% align:start
What do you want?

00:17:30.317 --> 00:17:32.084 position:21% line:89% align:start
- [Dwarf] Human here.

00:17:40.619 --> 00:17:42.853 position:35% line:89% align:start
(clacking)

00:18:06.157 --> 00:18:06.957 position:44% line:89% align:start
Stop.

00:18:06.990 --> 00:18:07.591 position:44% line:89% align:start
Stop!

00:18:07.624 --> 00:18:08.791 position:44% line:89% align:start
Stop!

00:18:10.891 --> 00:18:11.958 position:38% line:89% align:start
(crying)

00:18:11.991 --> 00:18:13.559 position:5% line:89% align:start

(crying)

00:20:18.049 --> 00:20:19.317 position:27% line:89% align:start
You're safe now.

00:20:41.454 --> 00:20:43.087 position:33% line:89% align:start
Now you know.

00:20:43.120 --> 00:20:45.888 position:27% line:83% align:start
Now you know what
Gray Dwarves are.

00:20:48.021 --> 00:20:50.322 position:16% line:89% align:start
- Yes, the Gray Dwarves.

00:20:50.355 --> 00:20:52.489 position:19% line:89% align:start
Now I know about them.

00:20:52.523 --> 00:20:53.889 position:30% line:89% align:start
I certainly do.

00:20:55.389 --> 00:20:57.023 position:21% line:83% align:start
- But what you don't
know yet is how

00:20:57.057 --> 00:21:00.057 position:30% line:83% align:start
you're supposed
to deal with them.

00:21:00.090 --> 00:21:04.358 position:21% line:83% align:start
If you're frightened,
they can see it in you.

00:21:04.391 --> 00:21:07.025 position:24% line:83% align:start
That's when they're
most dangerous.

00:21:07.059 --> 00:21:09.626 position:13% line:89% align:start
- That goes for everything.

00:21:09.659 --> 00:21:11.959 position:13% line:89% align:start
And not just Gray Dwarves.

00:21:11.993 --> 00:21:14.293 position:5% line:89% align:start
So the safest thing is not to be

00:21:14.327 --> 00:21:16.460 position:10% line:89% align:start
frightened in Mattis' Forest.

00:21:25.195 --> 00:21:27.896 position:19% line:89% align:start
- Not frightened, fine.

00:21:27.929 --> 00:21:29.196 position:27% line:89% align:start
I know that now.

00:21:37.264 --> 00:21:39.265 position:13% line:89% align:start
- Remember what I told you?

00:21:39.298 --> 00:21:40.098 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmm?

00:21:40.131 --> 00:21:41.265 position:27% line:89% align:start
To watch out for?

00:22:05.437 --> 00:22:06.537 position:33% line:89% align:start
- I remember.

00:22:09.471 --> 00:22:12.404 position:27% line:83% align:start
- And try not to
fall in the river.

00:22:13.571 --> 00:22:15.172 position:27% line:89% align:start
- All right then.
