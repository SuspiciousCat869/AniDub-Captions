- Pelje, you're coming home!

00:01:40.925 --> 00:01:43.161 position:10% line:83% align:start
- [Narrator] As the conflict
with the sheriff's soldiers

00:01:43.195 --> 00:01:47.032 position:16% line:83% align:start
intensified, Noddle-Pete
suggested that Mattis and Borka

00:01:47.065 --> 00:01:50.970 position:13% line:83% align:start
reconcile their differences
and unite their clans

00:01:51.003 --> 00:01:53.706 position:19% line:89% align:start
as one band of robbers.

00:01:53.739 --> 00:01:56.410 position:5% line:89% align:start
Then, they might stand a chance.

00:01:56.443 --> 00:02:00.147 position:19% line:83% align:start
But a strong band calls
for a strong chief.

00:02:01.849 --> 00:02:04.218 position:27% line:83% align:start
Mattis and Borka
would have to settle

00:02:04.251 --> 00:02:08.356 position:13% line:83% align:start
in a wild beasts match who
would become that chief.

00:02:20.369 --> 00:02:21.437 position:38% line:89% align:start
(groans)

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:23.706 position:27% line:89% align:start
- It's not fair!

00:02:25.074 --> 00:02:27.811 position:38% line:89% align:start
(groans)

00:02:27.844 --> 00:02:29.446 position:35% line:89% align:start
Guys, hey!

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:31.681 position:35% line:89% align:start
(cheering)

00:02:34.751 --> 00:02:37.121 position:7% line:89% align:start
I want to see what's happening!

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:40.992 position:35% line:89% align:start
(chuckles)

00:02:41.025 --> 00:02:42.727 position:19% line:89% align:start
- You're taking a rest?

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:44.695 position:30% line:89% align:start
Already tired?

00:02:44.729 --> 00:02:46.031 position:24% line:89% align:start
Well that was easy.

00:02:49.735 --> 00:02:51.837 position:38% line:89% align:start
(laughs)

00:02:54.407 --> 00:02:55.909 position:16% line:89% align:start
- [Man] Well done, Borka!

00:02:55.942 --> 00:02:57.110 position:30% line:89% align:start
Now pummel him!

00:03:00.414 --> 00:03:01.981 position:24% line:89% align:start
- What did you say?

00:03:02.015 --> 00:03:06.253 position:19% line:83% align:start
Something about feeling
tired, or needing a rest?

00:03:06.287 --> 00:03:10.192 position:19% line:83% align:start
When we were boys, you
always did need a nap.

00:03:10.225 --> 00:03:12.260 position:21% line:89% align:start
Huh, fine I can wait.

00:03:12.294 --> 00:03:13.727 position:7% line:89% align:start
[Lill-Klippen] Make him suffer!

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:16.364 position:38% line:89% align:start
- Borka!

00:03:16.398 --> 00:03:18.800 position:35% line:89% align:start
(grunting)

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:23.406 position:35% line:89% align:start
(cheering)

00:03:23.439 --> 00:03:24.207 position:35% line:89% align:start
- Amazing!

00:03:25.542 --> 00:03:28.345 position:7% line:89% align:start
- Now it's getting interesting!

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:34.519 position:16% line:89% align:start
- Let go, let go, let go!

00:03:38.389 --> 00:03:40.825 position:33% line:83% align:start
- [Borka] You
wanted me to let go.

00:03:40.858 --> 00:03:43.027 position:35% line:89% align:start
(grunting)

00:04:03.817 --> 00:04:05.819 position:35% line:89% align:start
(laughing)

00:04:09.156 --> 00:04:11.425 position:35% line:89% align:start
(grunting)

00:04:13.928 --> 00:04:16.164 position:13% line:89% align:start
- You're gonna regret that!

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:25.575 position:35% line:89% align:start
(chuckles)

00:04:25.608 --> 00:04:27.343 position:5% line:89% align:start
- [Man] Somebody get some water!

00:04:27.377 --> 00:04:28.311 position:30% line:89% align:start
- It's coming.

00:04:28.344 --> 00:04:29.912 position:24% line:83% align:start
- Here, here, here,
here, here, here, there.

00:04:32.849 --> 00:04:35.252 position:10% line:89% align:start
- [Man] And a one, and a two!

00:04:37.054 --> 00:04:39.457 position:13% line:89% align:start
That's it, wake up Mattis!

00:04:39.491 --> 00:04:42.394 position:21% line:83% align:start
- [Man] Come on, get
him, get him back!

00:04:42.427 --> 00:04:44.529 position:38% line:89% align:start
(yelling)

00:04:46.865 --> 00:04:48.366 position:16% line:89% align:start
- Don't let him do that!

00:04:48.401 --> 00:04:50.101 position:21% line:89% align:start
- Oh that's pathetic!

00:04:50.135 --> 00:04:51.537 position:30% line:89% align:start
- Boo boo boo!

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:53.873 position:19% line:83% align:start
- [Man] Mattis, chief,
get up and fight.

00:04:53.906 --> 00:04:55.875 position:19% line:89% align:start
- [Man] Come on chief!

00:04:59.078 --> 00:05:02.916 position:21% line:83% align:start
- Mattis, you really
shouldn't brag.

00:05:02.949 --> 00:05:04.851 position:35% line:89% align:start
(cheering)

00:05:07.588 --> 00:05:10.458 position:5% line:89% align:start
- Mattis could never beat Borka!

00:05:12.527 --> 00:05:13.361 position:41% line:89% align:start
- Yes!

00:05:18.634 --> 00:05:20.302 position:21% line:89% align:start
- Put your arm down.

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:25.974 position:27% line:83% align:start
The punches I can
take, but that smell.

00:05:26.008 --> 00:05:27.843 position:38% line:89% align:start
(groans)

00:05:28.645 --> 00:05:30.947 position:16% line:89% align:start
That smell is unbearable.

00:05:36.253 --> 00:05:38.522 position:35% line:89% align:start
(cheering)

00:05:47.966 --> 00:05:52.572 position:21% line:83% align:start
- Now's your chance,
squeeze him, squeeze him!

00:05:52.605 --> 00:05:55.006 position:16% line:89% align:start
- [Man] Just squeeze him.

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:57.977 position:21% line:83% align:start
- [Man] Yeah squeeze
him hard, hard!

00:05:59.379 --> 00:06:01.881 position:33% line:89% align:start
(gypsy music)

00:06:06.653 --> 00:06:08.989 position:16% line:89% align:start
- No sign of them today.

00:06:09.022 --> 00:06:11.992 position:21% line:83% align:start
- I know, we haven't
been robbed for ages.

00:06:12.025 --> 00:06:14.462 position:21% line:89% align:start
- That's unfortunate.

00:06:14.496 --> 00:06:16.030 position:19% line:89% align:start
Give us your treasure.

00:06:16.064 --> 00:06:16.965 position:33% line:89% align:start
- [Man] Halt!

00:06:16.998 --> 00:06:17.700 position:13% line:89% align:start
- [Jester] What's going on?

00:06:17.733 --> 00:06:20.503 position:10% line:89% align:start
- [Minstrel] Maybe it's them.

00:06:20.536 --> 00:06:23.105 position:24% line:83% align:start
- [Jester] They're
monsters, monsters!

00:06:23.139 --> 00:06:24.540 position:21% line:89% align:start
- You're the monster!

00:06:24.573 --> 00:06:27.443 position:35% line:89% align:start
(laughing)

00:06:27.476 --> 00:06:29.245 position:19% line:89% align:start
- Stop that, be quiet.

00:06:30.146 --> 00:06:32.115 position:13% line:89% align:start
Silence those instruments.

00:06:32.149 --> 00:06:34.584 position:24% line:83% align:start
You're drawing too
much attention.

00:06:34.618 --> 00:06:37.555 position:7% line:89% align:start
- Also, you're quite annoying.

00:06:37.588 --> 00:06:39.022 position:30% line:89% align:start
- How dare you!

00:06:39.055 --> 00:06:42.293 position:30% line:83% align:start
- Laughter and
music are relaxing.

00:06:42.326 --> 00:06:46.230 position:19% line:83% align:start
- You are both totally
unsophisticated.

00:06:46.264 --> 00:06:49.168 position:7% line:89% align:start
- Perhaps, but can't you hear?

00:06:49.201 --> 00:06:52.704 position:27% line:83% align:start
The robbers sound
absolutely savage.

00:06:52.739 --> 00:06:53.706 position:41% line:89% align:start
Listen.

00:06:55.107 --> 00:06:59.078 position:27% line:83% align:start
- They certainly
don't sound human.

00:06:59.112 --> 00:07:03.684 position:19% line:83% align:start
- For your own safety,
you should all turn back.

00:07:03.717 --> 00:07:05.719 position:13% line:89% align:start
This path is too dangerous.

00:07:08.055 --> 00:07:10.691 position:27% line:89% align:start
(distant roaring)

00:07:19.769 --> 00:07:22.204 position:35% line:89% align:start
(grunting)

00:07:38.422 --> 00:07:40.424 position:16% line:89% align:start
- You've almost got him!

00:07:44.796 --> 00:07:46.764 position:21% line:83% align:start
- [All Three] That's
what we think of you!

00:07:46.799 --> 00:07:47.733 position:33% line:89% align:start
- Oh that's!

00:07:49.635 --> 00:07:52.036 position:19% line:89% align:start
That's the last straw!

00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:54.707 position:24% line:83% align:start
- Wait, wait, stop
that, stop that.

00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:56.041 position:24% line:89% align:start
Back off, back off!

00:07:56.075 --> 00:07:58.778 position:30% line:83% align:start
I told you this
isn't your fight.

00:08:08.288 --> 00:08:09.390 position:33% line:89% align:start
- Your men...

00:08:11.091 --> 00:08:12.326 position:30% line:89% align:start
...are savages.

00:08:13.461 --> 00:08:16.632 position:24% line:83% align:start
- Yes, but you can
be second in command

00:08:16.665 --> 00:08:21.270 position:10% line:83% align:start
of those savages if you just
admit defeat, you dirty devil.

00:08:21.303 --> 00:08:22.638 position:7% line:89% align:start
In the meantime, I'll just keep

00:08:22.671 --> 00:08:25.073 position:10% line:89% align:start
squeezing the fat out of you.

00:08:25.107 --> 00:08:27.075 position:35% line:89% align:start
(groaning)

00:08:34.350 --> 00:08:37.688 position:24% line:83% align:start
Why don't you just
admit that I'm stronger?

00:08:37.721 --> 00:08:38.822 position:30% line:89% align:start
You can't win!

00:08:44.128 --> 00:08:46.230 position:35% line:89% align:start
Oh my nose!

00:08:47.632 --> 00:08:51.169 position:24% line:83% align:start
- [Borka] I'm sorry
to do this to you now.

00:08:51.202 --> 00:08:51.837 position:41% line:89% align:start
- What?

00:08:53.204 --> 00:08:56.208 position:24% line:83% align:start
- But I'm going to
teach you a lesson.

00:09:05.485 --> 00:09:07.487 position:27% line:83% align:start
You're lucky it's
not possible for you

00:09:07.521 --> 00:09:11.425 position:27% line:83% align:start
to be any uglier
than you already are.

00:09:11.458 --> 00:09:13.494 position:38% line:89% align:start
(laughs)

00:09:19.768 --> 00:09:22.438 position:5% line:89% align:start
- Ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow!

00:09:23.639 --> 00:09:27.142 position:21% line:83% align:start
Don't pull them off,
don't pull them off!

00:09:33.683 --> 00:09:35.485 position:24% line:89% align:start
I should feel bad.

00:09:35.518 --> 00:09:40.524 position:7% line:83% align:start
Undis won't recognize you when
I've finished with your face.

00:09:43.327 --> 00:09:46.798 position:5% line:89% align:start
Whose turn is it to be ugly now?

00:09:49.935 --> 00:09:51.203 position:35% line:89% align:start
(crunching)

00:09:51.236 --> 00:09:52.871 position:19% line:89% align:start
You must be kidding me!

00:09:55.407 --> 00:09:58.176 position:30% line:89% align:start
(bird calling)

00:09:59.946 --> 00:10:02.950 position:24% line:83% align:start
- There's no point
staying on guard duty,

00:10:02.983 --> 00:10:05.619 position:7% line:89% align:start
not with all of this going on!

00:10:07.220 --> 00:10:09.356 position:10% line:89% align:start
Mattis, I'll be right there!

00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:14.228 position:35% line:89% align:start
(cheering)

00:10:28.544 --> 00:10:29.378 position:38% line:89% align:start
- You...

00:10:30.413 --> 00:10:32.281 position:27% line:89% align:start
...should give...

00:10:32.314 --> 00:10:32.849 position:41% line:89% align:start
...up.

00:10:34.685 --> 00:10:36.353 position:24% line:89% align:start
- You're a madman.

00:10:36.386 --> 00:10:38.889 position:7% line:89% align:start
That's what I was going to say.

00:10:41.693 --> 00:10:42.527 position:41% line:89% align:start
Undis?

00:10:45.029 --> 00:10:47.298 position:35% line:89% align:start
(cheering)

00:10:50.301 --> 00:10:51.970 position:16% line:89% align:start
- That was a cheap trick!

00:10:53.304 --> 00:10:53.939 position:41% line:89% align:start
Lovis?

00:10:57.944 --> 00:10:58.978 position:21% line:89% align:start
- As if I'd fall for-

00:10:59.012 --> 00:11:01.213 position:38% line:89% align:start
(grunts)

00:11:04.984 --> 00:11:08.022 position:21% line:83% align:start
- You don't know who
you're dealing with.

00:11:08.055 --> 00:11:12.293 position:16% line:83% align:start
No one in this forest is
more stubborn than me!

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:20.702 position:24% line:89% align:start
- [All] Oh Mattis!

00:11:25.041 --> 00:11:25.875 position:41% line:89% align:start
- Wait.

00:11:33.483 --> 00:11:37.453 position:24% line:89% align:start
- One, two, three.

00:11:43.962 --> 00:11:47.966 position:30% line:83% align:start
- Don't tell me
you're tired already?

00:11:47.999 --> 00:11:50.301 position:21% line:89% align:start
Or maybe you forgot.

00:11:50.335 --> 00:11:54.039 position:19% line:89% align:start
If you lose, I'm chief!

00:11:55.406 --> 00:11:57.076 position:35% line:89% align:start
(chuckles)

00:11:57.109 --> 00:11:58.744 position:21% line:89% align:start
- Over my dead body.

00:12:00.113 --> 00:12:02.381 position:35% line:89% align:start
(cheering)

00:12:09.957 --> 00:12:12.325 position:38% line:89% align:start
(panting)

00:12:16.397 --> 00:12:18.466 position:16% line:89% align:start
- Hey, where are you all?

00:12:20.368 --> 00:12:21.003 position:47% line:89% align:start
Oh.

00:12:22.638 --> 00:12:25.474 position:27% line:89% align:start
(chanting Mattis)

00:12:37.054 --> 00:12:38.088 position:41% line:89% align:start
Mattis!

00:12:40.691 --> 00:12:43.561 position:19% line:89% align:start
Hang on, we're coming!

00:13:29.178 --> 00:13:31.413 position:35% line:89% align:start
(cheering)

00:13:33.116 --> 00:13:35.952 position:27% line:89% align:start
(chanting Mattis)

00:13:41.025 --> 00:13:42.392 position:30% line:89% align:start
- Is he alive?

00:13:58.510 --> 00:14:00.780 position:5% line:89% align:start
- You fought well, brother mine.

00:14:00.813 --> 00:14:02.181 position:35% line:89% align:start
Now listen.

00:14:02.215 --> 00:14:04.417 position:19% line:89% align:start
Because I'm a fair man,

00:14:05.184 --> 00:14:06.986 position:21% line:89% align:start
I'm keeping my word.

00:14:07.020 --> 00:14:10.057 position:19% line:83% align:start
As we agreed, your men
are welcome to stay on

00:14:10.090 --> 00:14:14.128 position:19% line:83% align:start
and you shall keep your
title as a robber chief.

00:14:14.161 --> 00:14:17.232 position:24% line:83% align:start
But now I lead you
all, and my word

00:14:17.265 --> 00:14:19.500 position:10% line:89% align:start
counts for more than Borka's.

00:14:19.533 --> 00:14:23.204 position:16% line:89% align:start
So remember, I am Mattis.

00:14:23.238 --> 00:14:25.974 position:16% line:89% align:start
The mightiest chieftain.

00:14:26.008 --> 00:14:27.209 position:7% line:89% align:start
The mightiest chieftain in all

00:14:27.243 --> 00:14:29.845 position:5% line:89% align:start
the mountains and all the woods.

00:14:31.547 --> 00:14:33.950 position:13% line:89% align:start
You and I are brothers now,

00:14:33.983 --> 00:14:37.220 position:24% line:83% align:start
and we'll put this
fight behind us.

00:14:37.254 --> 00:14:38.689 position:27% line:89% align:start
What do you say?

00:14:38.722 --> 00:14:41.224 position:27% line:89% align:start
(dramatic music)

00:14:55.207 --> 00:14:57.242 position:35% line:89% align:start
(cheering)

00:15:05.251 --> 00:15:07.253 position:16% line:89% align:start
I still think you smell.

00:15:19.066 --> 00:15:21.535 position:35% line:89% align:start
(laughing)

00:15:30.113 --> 00:15:31.613 position:27% line:89% align:start
- You know what?

00:15:31.646 --> 00:15:33.316 position:21% line:89% align:start
We've much in common.

00:15:33.349 --> 00:15:36.019 position:27% line:83% align:start
You like a drink,
I like a drink.

00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:44.228 position:24% line:89% align:start
- Rock wins again!

00:15:44.261 --> 00:15:46.264 position:35% line:89% align:start
(laughing)

00:15:55.140 --> 00:15:57.109 position:30% line:83% align:start
- And then she
said no I hit him.

00:15:57.143 --> 00:15:59.544 position:35% line:89% align:start
(laughing)

00:16:02.081 --> 00:16:03.350 position:30% line:89% align:start
- You're right.

00:16:03.383 --> 00:16:05.218 position:10% line:89% align:start
Do you remember the pig sty?

00:16:05.252 --> 00:16:08.155 position:5% line:89% align:start
Chasing rats all over the place.

00:16:08.188 --> 00:16:08.955 position:41% line:89% align:start
- Yes!

00:16:10.390 --> 00:16:14.094 position:21% line:83% align:start
Yes it was my job to
chase the rats out.

00:16:14.128 --> 00:16:18.232 position:21% line:83% align:start
- Then I would get a
bucket upturned like this.

00:16:18.266 --> 00:16:21.302 position:24% line:83% align:start
- And then I would
go like this, hah!

00:16:24.906 --> 00:16:26.607 position:33% line:89% align:start
- We got him!

00:16:26.641 --> 00:16:28.844 position:35% line:89% align:start
(laughing)

00:16:51.369 --> 00:16:53.637 position:16% line:89% align:start
- Now for the good news.

00:16:53.671 --> 00:16:55.807 position:10% line:89% align:start
Today you've suffered a loss.

00:16:57.275 --> 00:17:01.414 position:16% line:83% align:start
But ultimately, your clan
will be the real winners.

00:17:01.447 --> 00:17:04.750 position:19% line:83% align:start
One day when you and I
are no longer around,

00:17:04.784 --> 00:17:08.154 position:19% line:83% align:start
your son will be chief
of both our clans.

00:17:10.190 --> 00:17:14.394 position:13% line:83% align:start
Ronja has said she doesn't
want to be a robber.

00:17:14.428 --> 00:17:19.666 position:16% line:83% align:start
Once her mind is made up,
there's no changing it.

00:17:19.700 --> 00:17:21.035 position:27% line:89% align:start
So now you know.

00:17:21.069 --> 00:17:22.904 position:19% line:89% align:start
You've won, old friend.

00:17:25.707 --> 00:17:27.642 position:19% line:89% align:start
- I, I can't believe...

00:17:29.078 --> 00:17:31.447 position:27% line:83% align:start
- Do you honestly
think Birk wants

00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:34.417 position:30% line:83% align:start
to be a robber
chieftain like you two?

00:17:37.988 --> 00:17:40.357 position:13% line:89% align:start
- Well he does, of course!

00:17:40.390 --> 00:17:42.759 position:35% line:89% align:start
(laughing)

00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:46.430 position:7% line:89% align:start
- Borka, I now make this oath.

00:17:46.464 --> 00:17:50.768 position:19% line:83% align:start
That I, Birk Borkason,
will never become a robber.

00:17:54.473 --> 00:17:56.441 position:38% line:89% align:start
(gasping)

00:18:12.493 --> 00:18:16.163 position:19% line:83% align:start
- I know, it's hard to
get used to the idea.

00:18:22.036 --> 00:18:25.106 position:21% line:83% align:start
But now you're gonna
have to as well.

00:18:26.875 --> 00:18:29.911 position:21% line:83% align:start
You can't do anything
with children these days.

00:18:29.945 --> 00:18:32.315 position:21% line:89% align:start
They do as they like.

00:18:32.348 --> 00:18:34.884 position:7% line:89% align:start
We just have to get used to it.

00:18:40.557 --> 00:18:42.326 position:38% line:89% align:start
(groans)

00:18:42.359 --> 00:18:44.361 position:16% line:89% align:start
I know it's hard to take.

00:18:45.796 --> 00:18:48.966 position:7% line:89% align:start
But that's just the way it is.

00:18:48.999 --> 00:18:51.169 position:35% line:89% align:start
(laughing)

00:19:07.554 --> 00:19:10.523 position:24% line:83% align:start
Our children won't
do as we ask them,

00:19:10.557 --> 00:19:12.425 position:19% line:89% align:start
but we should carry on.

00:19:12.459 --> 00:19:15.061 position:5% line:89% align:start
Enjoy our cheerful robber lives.

00:19:17.465 --> 00:19:19.033 position:24% line:89% align:start
- Yes you're right.

00:19:21.202 --> 00:19:23.472 position:35% line:89% align:start
(cheering)

00:19:25.873 --> 00:19:27.943 position:35% line:89% align:start
(laughing)

00:19:50.435 --> 00:19:55.307 position:10% line:83% align:start
- It's lovely not to have to
sit up there with the men folk.

00:19:55.340 --> 00:19:56.808 position:27% line:89% align:start
Peace and quiet.

00:19:58.644 --> 00:20:01.079 position:13% line:89% align:start
- Not to mention the smell.

00:20:02.615 --> 00:20:04.884 position:35% line:89% align:start
(laughing)

00:20:24.072 --> 00:20:26.341 position:35% line:89% align:start
(coughing)

00:20:32.147 --> 00:20:34.249 position:38% line:89% align:start
(groans)

00:20:35.984 --> 00:20:38.254 position:35% line:89% align:start
(coughing)

00:20:39.922 --> 00:20:40.957 position:30% line:89% align:start
- There you go.

00:20:43.661 --> 00:20:46.330 position:38% line:89% align:start
(laughs)

00:20:46.364 --> 00:20:48.432 position:13% line:89% align:start
- I'm proud of you, Ronja.

00:20:48.466 --> 00:20:53.572 position:13% line:83% align:start
You know a robber's life is
not as much fun as it once was.

00:20:53.605 --> 00:20:56.107 position:7% line:89% align:start
It's no life for you and Birk.

00:21:00.212 --> 00:21:03.982 position:24% line:83% align:start
It used to be fun,
but now it's tougher.

00:21:05.951 --> 00:21:09.055 position:19% line:83% align:start
The soldiers will hang
you before you know it.

00:21:09.088 --> 00:21:10.957 position:24% line:83% align:start
I couldn't bear to
think of what might

00:21:10.990 --> 00:21:12.659 position:19% line:89% align:start
happen to you and Birk.

00:21:14.728 --> 00:21:16.697 position:27% line:89% align:start
You're good kids.

00:21:16.730 --> 00:21:20.602 position:21% line:83% align:start
You shouldn't be out
there robbing anyone.

00:21:20.635 --> 00:21:22.704 position:24% line:89% align:start
- Yes, it's awful.

00:21:22.737 --> 00:21:25.240 position:19% line:83% align:start
I wouldn't want anyone
to steal from me,

00:21:25.273 --> 00:21:28.376 position:27% line:83% align:start
so why would I do
that to anyone else?

00:21:34.550 --> 00:21:35.384 position:38% line:89% align:start
- Ronja.

00:21:40.256 --> 00:21:45.061 position:19% line:83% align:start
I've got a secret I've
been waiting to tell.

00:21:45.095 --> 00:21:47.698 position:13% line:89% align:start
Now listen very carefully.

00:21:47.732 --> 00:21:51.469 position:24% line:83% align:start
I'll tell you, you
might need this one day.

00:21:54.672 --> 00:21:56.708 position:7% line:89% align:start
There's a special place I know.

00:21:56.742 --> 00:21:59.076 position:33% line:89% align:start
(whispering)

00:22:01.480 --> 00:22:04.183 position:27% line:89% align:start
(pleasant music)

00:22:06.753 --> 00:22:08.721 position:38% line:89% align:start
(snoring)

00:22:25.039 --> 00:22:27.074 position:35% line:89% align:start
(groaning)

00:22:41.524 --> 00:22:43.727 position:10% line:89% align:start
- Don't you care I'm in pain?

00:22:46.830 --> 00:22:48.398 position:35% line:89% align:start
I'm aching!

00:22:48.432 --> 00:22:50.367 position:16% line:89% align:start
Every single part of me!

00:22:52.069 --> 00:22:57.242 position:10% line:83% align:start
My only hope is that Borka is
hurting even worse than I am!

00:22:58.844 --> 00:23:00.178 position:27% line:89% align:start
What do you say?

00:23:02.180 --> 00:23:06.151 position:16% line:83% align:start
- Oh you big baby, you'll
feel better in the morning.

00:23:06.185 --> 00:23:07.486 position:38% line:89% align:start
(groans)

00:23:08.755 --> 00:23:12.359 position:19% line:83% align:start
- [Narrator] And so the
two long feuding clans

00:23:12.392 --> 00:23:16.162 position:19% line:83% align:start
were now united as one
strong band of robbers.

00:23:22.537 --> 00:23:25.273 position:24% line:83% align:start
Next time on Ronja,
the Robber's Daughter.

00:23:25.306 --> 00:23:28.042 position:30% line:89% align:start
(upbeat music)

00:23:30.712 --> 00:23:32.314 position:21% line:89% align:start
"The Call of Spring".

00:23:33.782 --> 00:23:35.852 position:30% line:89% align:start
Don't miss it.

00:23:35.885 --> 00:23:38.555 position:27% line:89% align:start
(pleasant music)
