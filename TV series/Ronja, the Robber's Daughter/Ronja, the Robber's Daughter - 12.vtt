- I will get
to the other side.

00:01:40.057 --> 00:01:42.427 position:27% line:83% align:start
All this rock and
rubble can't stop me.

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:46.263 position:27% line:83% align:start
Birk's there, and
I will get to him.

00:01:46.296 --> 00:01:49.299 position:21% line:83% align:start
- [Narrator] Finally,
Ronja's fever was gone.

00:01:49.333 --> 00:01:51.368 position:16% line:83% align:start
As the snow continued to
fall outside the fort,

00:01:51.401 --> 00:01:53.370 position:13% line:89% align:start
she worked hard beneath it,

00:01:53.403 --> 00:01:56.973 position:16% line:83% align:start
removing rubble blocking
an underground passage.

00:01:57.006 --> 00:01:59.809 position:24% line:83% align:start
She hoped that this
would lead her to Birk.

00:01:59.842 --> 00:02:02.378 position:7% line:89% align:start
The boy she now called brother.

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:09.218 position:38% line:89% align:start
(tapping)

00:02:26.434 --> 00:02:28.969 position:35% line:89% align:start
(whistling)

00:03:05.405 --> 00:03:07.473 position:35% line:89% align:start
(rustling)

00:03:19.318 --> 00:03:21.153 position:30% line:89% align:start
- [Birk] Ronja?

00:03:21.186 --> 00:03:21.952 position:41% line:89% align:start
- Birk!

00:03:25.022 --> 00:03:26.324 position:44% line:89% align:start
Birk.

00:03:26.357 --> 00:03:29.126 position:27% line:83% align:start
Could that really
be you up there?

00:03:32.029 --> 00:03:34.864 position:13% line:83% align:start
I need to know if you still
want to be my brother.

00:03:34.898 --> 00:03:36.033 position:41% line:89% align:start
Do you?

00:03:36.067 --> 00:03:38.269 position:35% line:89% align:start
(laughing)

00:03:41.338 --> 00:03:44.407 position:24% line:83% align:start
- [Birk] Of course
I do, sister mine.

00:03:45.942 --> 00:03:48.378 position:10% line:89% align:start
It's good to hear your voice.

00:03:48.411 --> 00:03:50.580 position:16% line:89% align:start
I'd like to see you, too.

00:03:52.048 --> 00:03:55.485 position:19% line:83% align:start
Are your eyes still as
black as they used to be?

00:03:55.518 --> 00:03:57.587 position:38% line:89% align:start
(giggles)

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:01.357 position:21% line:83% align:start
- Why don't you come
and see for yourself?

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:03.959 position:30% line:89% align:start
(loud rustling)

00:04:05.661 --> 00:04:08.030 position:38% line:89% align:start
(shushes)

00:04:10.666 --> 00:04:13.034 position:38% line:89% align:start
(tapping)

00:04:28.483 --> 00:04:29.317 position:38% line:89% align:start
Tomorrow.

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:49.703 position:35% line:89% align:start
(screaming)

00:04:49.736 --> 00:04:52.571 position:19% line:89% align:start
- Just as I suspected.

00:04:52.605 --> 00:04:55.975 position:7% line:89% align:start
In the name of all the harpies.

00:04:56.008 --> 00:04:59.944 position:16% line:83% align:start
Ronja, what have you been
doing down here, then?

00:05:02.515 --> 00:05:03.449 position:41% line:89% align:start
- Uh...

00:05:03.482 --> 00:05:06.351 position:21% line:83% align:start
Sometimes even I get
bored of shoveling snow.

00:05:06.384 --> 00:05:07.152 position:44% line:89% align:start
- Oh.

00:05:09.587 --> 00:05:12.357 position:27% line:83% align:start
- Come on, let's
get out of here.

00:05:16.194 --> 00:05:17.662 position:44% line:89% align:start
- Ah.

00:05:17.695 --> 00:05:21.265 position:21% line:83% align:start
Of course, you can't
shovel snow all the time.

00:05:25.637 --> 00:05:29.006 position:27% line:83% align:start
Though down here,
it's just as cold.

00:05:29.039 --> 00:05:32.975 position:19% line:83% align:start
Let's get nice and warm
and play some dice, hmm?

00:05:34.611 --> 00:05:37.280 position:5% line:89% align:start
You were never down here, right?

00:05:39.248 --> 00:05:40.517 position:41% line:89% align:start
- Yeah.

00:05:40.551 --> 00:05:42.518 position:21% line:89% align:start
Never here, exactly.

00:05:42.552 --> 00:05:43.453 position:33% line:89% align:start
Come on then.

00:05:43.486 --> 00:05:45.521 position:38% line:89% align:start
(laughs)

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:50.560 position:30% line:89% align:start
(playful music)

00:06:07.209 --> 00:06:08.108 position:35% line:89% align:start
- Go ahead.

00:06:14.583 --> 00:06:16.584 position:41% line:89% align:start
(sighs)

00:06:18.452 --> 00:06:21.088 position:41% line:89% align:start
(hums)

00:06:21.121 --> 00:06:23.123 position:38% line:89% align:start
(grunts)

00:06:44.677 --> 00:06:46.779 position:38% line:89% align:start
(groans)

00:06:49.181 --> 00:06:51.350 position:38% line:89% align:start
(snoring)

00:07:03.529 --> 00:07:06.330 position:13% line:83% align:start
- If Mattis wants to throw
out the Borka Robbers,

00:07:06.364 --> 00:07:10.468 position:13% line:83% align:start
how come he didn't remember
the underground passage?

00:07:12.637 --> 00:07:15.239 position:33% line:89% align:start
(soft music)

00:07:19.677 --> 00:07:21.278 position:24% line:89% align:start
I'm glad he didn't.

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:25.081 position:16% line:83% align:start
The Borka Robbers must be
allowed to stay where they are

00:07:25.115 --> 00:07:26.616 position:24% line:89% align:start
in the north fort.

00:07:26.650 --> 00:07:28.385 position:24% line:89% align:start
Then Birk can stay.

00:07:34.189 --> 00:07:35.659 position:38% line:89% align:start
Tomorrow.

00:07:35.692 --> 00:07:36.526 position:35% line:89% align:start
Can't wait.

00:07:38.628 --> 00:07:41.063 position:33% line:89% align:start
(soft music)

00:07:58.346 --> 00:08:00.415 position:38% line:89% align:start
(grunts)

00:08:01.649 --> 00:08:04.319 position:24% line:83% align:start
- If we do not comb
your hair more,

00:08:04.352 --> 00:08:07.187 position:13% line:83% align:start
they'll think the daughter
of Mattis the robber

00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:08.756 position:24% line:89% align:start
is covered in lice.

00:08:09.657 --> 00:08:11.726 position:16% line:89% align:start
And they'll laugh at you.

00:08:13.728 --> 00:08:15.629 position:38% line:89% align:start
(groans)

00:08:22.903 --> 00:08:24.771 position:21% line:89% align:start
You too, Mr. Mattis.

00:08:28.709 --> 00:08:30.677 position:38% line:89% align:start
(screams)

00:08:32.345 --> 00:08:33.179 position:38% line:89% align:start
- Oh no.

00:08:38.184 --> 00:08:40.185 position:41% line:89% align:start
(yelps)

00:08:51.396 --> 00:08:53.598 position:16% line:89% align:start
Look at this matted hair.

00:08:53.632 --> 00:08:54.866 position:24% line:89% align:start
You lousy robbers.

00:08:56.668 --> 00:08:58.703 position:10% line:89% align:start
All twelve of you with lice.

00:08:58.737 --> 00:09:02.272 position:24% line:89% align:start
I have had enough.

00:09:03.474 --> 00:09:06.610 position:27% line:83% align:start
- Please, you're
tearing out my hair.

00:09:06.644 --> 00:09:08.879 position:13% line:83% align:start
- So our fearless chief is
afraid

00:09:08.912 --> 00:09:10.748 position:13% line:89% align:start
of having his hair combed.

00:09:13.484 --> 00:09:17.554 position:21% line:83% align:start
As long as I have the
power, I will continue

00:09:17.588 --> 00:09:20.490 position:24% line:89% align:start
to comb your hair.

00:09:21.792 --> 00:09:22.860 position:27% line:89% align:start
- That's enough.

00:09:22.893 --> 00:09:23.660 position:38% line:89% align:start
Spare me.

00:09:25.328 --> 00:09:27.263 position:13% line:89% align:start
- Shame it stopped snowing.

00:09:27.296 --> 00:09:28.798 position:21% line:89% align:start
I was enjoying that.

00:09:28.831 --> 00:09:30.600 position:33% line:89% align:start
Good weather.

00:09:30.633 --> 00:09:31.734 position:38% line:89% align:start
(yawning)

00:09:31.768 --> 00:09:32.769 position:30% line:89% align:start
We're starving.

00:09:34.971 --> 00:09:38.775 position:21% line:83% align:start
- Meals are for those
who've done all their work.

00:09:38.808 --> 00:09:40.442 position:13% line:89% align:start
- It's too early for that.

00:09:40.475 --> 00:09:42.911 position:27% line:83% align:start
- Yeah, and we've
had nothing to eat.

00:09:42.944 --> 00:09:46.848 position:16% line:83% align:start
- Finish doing everything
before it snows again.

00:09:46.882 --> 00:09:47.849 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:09:50.719 --> 00:09:51.553 position:47% line:89% align:start
Ah.

00:09:53.354 --> 00:09:55.489 position:19% line:83% align:start
- I stayed up all night
coming up with a new plan

00:09:55.523 --> 00:09:58.793 position:7% line:89% align:start
to drag the Borka Robbers out.

00:09:58.826 --> 00:10:02.296 position:21% line:83% align:start
- You're able to make
plans while you're snoring?

00:10:02.329 --> 00:10:04.932 position:16% line:89% align:start
That is truly impressive.

00:10:04.965 --> 00:10:06.500 position:35% line:89% align:start
- Go ahead.

00:10:06.534 --> 00:10:07.935 position:19% line:89% align:start
Tease me if you'd like.

00:10:07.968 --> 00:10:10.805 position:24% line:83% align:start
But I promise you,
this is a great scheme.

00:10:10.838 --> 00:10:12.706 position:38% line:89% align:start
(coughs)

00:10:14.274 --> 00:10:18.745 position:13% line:83% align:start
Although maybe we shouldn't
talk here about the plan.

00:10:22.582 --> 00:10:23.650 position:35% line:89% align:start
- Ah, yes.

00:10:24.784 --> 00:10:28.654 position:27% line:83% align:start
Perhaps we should
speak in my room then.

00:10:28.687 --> 00:10:31.857 position:27% line:83% align:start
- That's exactly
what I had in mind.

00:10:31.890 --> 00:10:33.759 position:38% line:89% align:start
(laughs)

00:10:41.533 --> 00:10:43.468 position:19% line:89% align:start
- Now get back to work.

00:10:44.335 --> 00:10:45.804 position:33% line:89% align:start
- Yes, Lovis.

00:10:45.838 --> 00:10:47.872 position:16% line:89% align:start
We're going, we're going.

00:10:52.410 --> 00:10:54.812 position:33% line:89% align:start
(door shuts)

00:11:19.502 --> 00:11:23.873 position:24% line:83% align:start
- I might just eat
my lunch underground.

00:11:23.906 --> 00:11:26.575 position:30% line:89% align:start
(playful music)

00:12:06.512 --> 00:12:07.346 position:41% line:89% align:start
Hello?

00:12:12.785 --> 00:12:13.619 position:44% line:89% align:start
Birk?

00:12:18.090 --> 00:12:19.759 position:38% line:89% align:start
Come on.

00:12:23.896 --> 00:12:25.898 position:41% line:89% align:start
(sighs)

00:12:28.968 --> 00:12:30.969 position:41% line:89% align:start
(gasps)

00:12:34.039 --> 00:12:36.908 position:5% line:89% align:start
- It's about time you came down.

00:12:37.876 --> 00:12:40.145 position:19% line:89% align:start
- I could hardly wait.

00:12:40.178 --> 00:12:41.980 position:21% line:83% align:start
Especially since you
saved me from the

00:12:42.013 --> 00:12:44.082 position:21% line:89% align:start
rumphobs and harpies.

00:12:44.115 --> 00:12:45.883 position:19% line:89% align:start
It's great to see you.

00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:50.921 position:30% line:89% align:start
- And you too.

00:12:50.955 --> 00:12:52.790 position:16% line:89% align:start
I can see your eyes now.

00:12:52.823 --> 00:12:53.757 position:33% line:89% align:start
Still black.

00:12:58.595 --> 00:13:01.698 position:30% line:83% align:start
And yet, you've
grown a little paler.

00:13:05.034 --> 00:13:06.469 position:38% line:89% align:start
- Have I?

00:13:06.502 --> 00:13:09.606 position:10% line:89% align:start
Well you look a lot thinner.

00:13:09.639 --> 00:13:10.372 position:38% line:89% align:start
- I know.

00:13:11.608 --> 00:13:14.010 position:19% line:83% align:start
Because I haven't been
eating all that much.

00:13:14.043 --> 00:13:15.577 position:21% line:83% align:start
Still, I've had more
than anyone else

00:13:15.611 --> 00:13:17.113 position:27% line:89% align:start
in Borka's Keep.

00:13:17.146 --> 00:13:19.982 position:13% line:83% align:start
But a bit more than nothing
is still next to nothing.

00:13:20.016 --> 00:13:23.085 position:16% line:83% align:start
- Do you mean there's not
enough to eat for you all?

00:13:23.118 --> 00:13:26.455 position:19% line:83% align:start
That there's not enough
food for everyone?

00:13:26.488 --> 00:13:28.023 position:21% line:89% align:start
- Yes, that's right.

00:13:28.056 --> 00:13:32.560 position:10% line:83% align:start
None of us have had enough to
eat for quite some time now.

00:13:32.593 --> 00:13:35.596 position:7% line:89% align:start
We might not make it to spring.

00:13:35.630 --> 00:13:38.100 position:16% line:83% align:start
At this rate, I'm afraid
we'll all be dead.

00:13:38.133 --> 00:13:40.768 position:21% line:89% align:start
Just like you wanted.

00:13:40.801 --> 00:13:43.137 position:21% line:89% align:start
That's what you said.

00:13:43.170 --> 00:13:43.938 position:38% line:89% align:start
Remember?

00:13:47.108 --> 00:13:49.576 position:13% line:89% align:start
- Maybe, when we first met.

00:13:49.609 --> 00:13:51.178 position:19% line:89% align:start
But not anymore, Birk.

00:13:51.212 --> 00:13:52.980 position:19% line:89% align:start
Now you're my brother.

00:13:54.081 --> 00:13:55.982 position:24% line:89% align:start
And I'll help you.

00:13:56.016 --> 00:13:58.785 position:16% line:89% align:start
My brother won't starve.

00:13:58.818 --> 00:14:00.954 position:33% line:89% align:start
(soft music)

00:14:08.194 --> 00:14:10.996 position:41% line:89% align:start
(gasps)

00:14:11.030 --> 00:14:11.997 position:27% line:89% align:start
You have to eat.

00:14:12.031 --> 00:14:14.199 position:19% line:89% align:start
Please take the bread.

00:14:14.233 --> 00:14:16.769 position:33% line:89% align:start
(soft music)

00:15:01.311 --> 00:15:03.713 position:35% line:89% align:start
(giggling)

00:15:05.047 --> 00:15:09.517 position:16% line:83% align:start
But wasn't all this food
meant to be for you?

00:15:09.551 --> 00:15:12.121 position:7% line:89% align:start
- I'm not the one who's hungry.

00:15:12.154 --> 00:15:16.225 position:19% line:83% align:start
Anyway, there's plenty
more where that came from.

00:15:16.258 --> 00:15:18.626 position:33% line:89% align:start
(soft music)

00:15:38.112 --> 00:15:40.881 position:27% line:89% align:start
(stomach gurgles)

00:15:42.049 --> 00:15:45.618 position:24% line:83% align:start
So why is everyone
starving in your fort?

00:15:47.321 --> 00:15:49.189 position:30% line:83% align:start
- The thing is,
when we moved here,

00:15:49.223 --> 00:15:51.524 position:13% line:89% align:start
we left everything behind.

00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:58.131 position:13% line:83% align:start
What little food we brought
is finally running out.

00:16:11.109 --> 00:16:14.146 position:21% line:83% align:start
Before we came here,
we had goats, sheep,

00:16:14.179 --> 00:16:16.248 position:24% line:89% align:start
and stores of food.

00:16:16.281 --> 00:16:19.051 position:24% line:83% align:start
Now horses are all
we've got left.

00:16:21.053 --> 00:16:23.021 position:19% line:83% align:start
We stabled them for the
winter with a farmer

00:16:23.055 --> 00:16:24.922 position:19% line:89% align:start
down beyond the forest.

00:16:26.023 --> 00:16:27.825 position:19% line:89% align:start
Thank goodness we did.

00:16:29.026 --> 00:16:30.661 position:24% line:83% align:start
Otherwise, we would
have had to eat them.

00:16:30.694 --> 00:16:31.962 position:27% line:89% align:start
Can you imagine?

00:16:32.830 --> 00:16:35.299 position:38% line:89% align:start
(laughs)

00:16:35.332 --> 00:16:38.069 position:7% line:89% align:start
Ah, what a winter we're having.

00:16:39.936 --> 00:16:42.173 position:35% line:89% align:start
(laughing)

00:16:46.377 --> 00:16:48.378 position:27% line:89% align:start
Poor old robbers.

00:16:48.411 --> 00:16:51.247 position:24% line:89% align:start
That's what we are.

00:16:51.281 --> 00:16:53.983 position:27% line:83% align:start
You can smell the
stench of winter on me,

00:16:54.017 --> 00:16:55.684 position:27% line:89% align:start
can't you Ronja?

00:16:55.717 --> 00:16:56.752 position:33% line:89% align:start
I reek of it.

00:17:00.923 --> 00:17:03.358 position:10% line:89% align:start
Hardly had any water, either.

00:17:03.393 --> 00:17:06.728 position:19% line:89% align:start
(strong blowing winds)

00:17:15.270 --> 00:17:19.341 position:13% line:83% align:start
Trying to haul water up the
cliff base was impossible.

00:17:19.374 --> 00:17:21.742 position:10% line:89% align:start
So now, we have to melt snow.

00:17:23.945 --> 00:17:26.280 position:24% line:83% align:start
Just to get a small
amount of water,

00:17:26.314 --> 00:17:28.049 position:19% line:89% align:start
we have to make a fire.

00:17:28.082 --> 00:17:32.186 position:13% line:83% align:start
But we don't want to use up
what little wood we have left.

00:17:35.255 --> 00:17:38.191 position:27% line:83% align:start
And now you know
why us Borka Robbers

00:17:38.225 --> 00:17:39.860 position:27% line:89% align:start
all smell so bad.

00:17:40.794 --> 00:17:42.329 position:5% line:89% align:start
- Don't think that you're alone.

00:17:42.362 --> 00:17:44.331 position:13% line:89% align:start
Our robbers smell the same.

00:17:44.364 --> 00:17:46.665 position:38% line:89% align:start
(giggles)

00:17:54.106 --> 00:17:57.776 position:16% line:83% align:start
- [Ronja] He's certainly
a handsome brother.

00:18:00.312 --> 00:18:01.713 position:21% line:89% align:start
- It's not important.

00:18:01.746 --> 00:18:04.250 position:21% line:83% align:start
It doesn't matter if
you're poor, and smelly,

00:18:04.283 --> 00:18:08.153 position:10% line:89% align:start
and covered in dirt and lice.

00:18:08.186 --> 00:18:09.988 position:13% line:89% align:start
I won't see you go hungry.

00:18:10.021 --> 00:18:10.788 position:38% line:89% align:start
I won't.

00:18:12.223 --> 00:18:15.793 position:13% line:83% align:start
- And what makes you think
that I might have lice?

00:18:15.827 --> 00:18:18.296 position:41% line:89% align:start
(gasps)

00:18:18.329 --> 00:18:20.398 position:35% line:89% align:start
(giggling)

00:18:20.431 --> 00:18:22.267 position:16% line:89% align:start
Oh, and the truth is out.

00:18:24.001 --> 00:18:27.838 position:16% line:83% align:start
But I'd rather have lice
than go hungry again.

00:18:27.871 --> 00:18:29.139 position:27% line:89% align:start
That's for sure.

00:18:31.742 --> 00:18:33.977 position:13% line:89% align:start
Hunger is a terrible thing.

00:18:36.213 --> 00:18:37.414 position:47% line:89% align:start
Oh!

00:18:37.447 --> 00:18:39.015 position:27% line:89% align:start
What about Undis?

00:18:39.048 --> 00:18:43.252 position:21% line:83% align:start
I forgot to leave any
of the bread for her.

00:18:43.286 --> 00:18:44.253 position:38% line:89% align:start
- Right.

00:18:44.287 --> 00:18:46.022 position:13% line:89% align:start
I'll get some straightaway.

00:18:46.055 --> 00:18:46.989 position:33% line:89% align:start
- Please, no.

00:18:48.191 --> 00:18:51.427 position:16% line:83% align:start
Undis would ask me where
the bread came from.

00:18:51.460 --> 00:18:55.331 position:21% line:83% align:start
How could I tell her
that you gave it to me?

00:18:55.364 --> 00:19:00.403 position:21% line:83% align:start
And Borka would be so
furious, he'd split the sky.

00:19:00.436 --> 00:19:03.371 position:24% line:83% align:start
And if he knew I'd
become your brother.

00:19:06.341 --> 00:19:07.775 position:41% line:89% align:start
(sighs)

00:19:07.808 --> 00:19:09.377 position:30% line:89% align:start
- That's true.

00:19:09.411 --> 00:19:11.812 position:24% line:83% align:start
I don't understand
why everything has

00:19:11.845 --> 00:19:13.080 position:21% line:89% align:start
to be so complicated.

00:19:14.982 --> 00:19:16.083 position:38% line:89% align:start
Oh, Birk.

00:19:16.116 --> 00:19:18.719 position:5% line:89% align:start
We can only ever meet in secret.

00:19:20.221 --> 00:19:21.055 position:35% line:89% align:start
- I agree.

00:19:22.423 --> 00:19:25.459 position:27% line:83% align:start
And I hate doing
things in secret.

00:19:25.492 --> 00:19:27.194 position:24% line:89% align:start
- I feel the same.

00:19:27.228 --> 00:19:31.332 position:16% line:83% align:start
The only thing worse than
salted cart is long winters.

00:19:31.365 --> 00:19:33.233 position:24% line:83% align:start
And the only thing
worse than long winters

00:19:33.266 --> 00:19:35.435 position:27% line:89% align:start
is silly secrets.

00:19:35.468 --> 00:19:36.336 position:38% line:89% align:start
(groans)

00:19:36.369 --> 00:19:37.937 position:24% line:89% align:start
Do you understand?

00:19:37.971 --> 00:19:40.139 position:21% line:83% align:start
Hiding our friendship
is wrong, I tell you.

00:19:40.173 --> 00:19:40.974 position:35% line:89% align:start
It's wrong.

00:19:41.007 --> 00:19:43.775 position:38% line:89% align:start
(giggles)

00:19:43.809 --> 00:19:47.913 position:16% line:83% align:start
- But we'll do it for our
sake, won't we sister mine?

00:19:50.315 --> 00:19:51.350 position:41% line:89% align:start
- Mhm.

00:19:53.051 --> 00:19:55.988 position:19% line:83% align:start
- When spring comes, we
can meet in the woods

00:19:56.021 --> 00:20:00.425 position:7% line:89% align:start
instead of this ice cold place.

00:20:00.459 --> 00:20:03.328 position:38% line:89% align:start
(shivers)

00:20:03.362 --> 00:20:04.529 position:30% line:89% align:start
- That's true.

00:20:04.563 --> 00:20:06.097 position:27% line:89% align:start
I have to go now.

00:20:11.335 --> 00:20:13.437 position:16% line:89% align:start
Before I freeze to death.

00:20:28.285 --> 00:20:31.021 position:7% line:89% align:start
- Will you come back tomorrow?

00:20:31.054 --> 00:20:32.222 position:38% line:89% align:start
(giggles)

00:20:32.255 --> 00:20:34.324 position:10% line:89% align:start
To your lice-ridden brother?

00:20:36.493 --> 00:20:38.361 position:33% line:89% align:start
- Of course.

00:20:38.395 --> 00:20:40.929 position:33% line:89% align:start
(soft music)

00:20:46.402 --> 00:20:48.437 position:19% line:83% align:start
- [Narrator] And Ronja
kept her promise.

00:20:48.470 --> 00:20:51.373 position:13% line:83% align:start
Throughout the winter, she
woke up early every morning

00:20:51.407 --> 00:20:53.409 position:24% line:89% align:start
and met with Birk.

00:20:53.442 --> 00:20:55.377 position:21% line:83% align:start
She gave him food to
help him and his family

00:20:55.411 --> 00:20:58.279 position:5% line:89% align:start
survive the harsh winter months.

00:20:58.313 --> 00:21:00.915 position:16% line:83% align:start
If Mattis ever found out
that Ronja was responsible

00:21:00.948 --> 00:21:03.384 position:19% line:83% align:start
for keeping his enemies
from starvation,

00:21:03.418 --> 00:21:05.286 position:21% line:89% align:start
he would be furious.

00:21:05.320 --> 00:21:07.422 position:38% line:89% align:start
(snoring)

00:21:15.195 --> 00:21:17.397 position:33% line:89% align:start
(soft music)

00:21:39.918 --> 00:21:40.553 position:41% line:89% align:start
- Here.

00:21:43.422 --> 00:21:47.593 position:16% line:83% align:start
Hide these in your stores
for your mother to find.

00:21:53.398 --> 00:21:57.502 position:16% line:83% align:start
- Oh, it feels a bit like
I'm stealing this from you.

00:21:57.535 --> 00:21:59.204 position:38% line:89% align:start
(giggles)

00:21:59.237 --> 00:22:00.438 position:30% line:89% align:start
- Really, Birk?

00:22:00.472 --> 00:22:03.375 position:27% line:83% align:start
You forget I am a
robber's daughter.

00:22:03.408 --> 00:22:06.110 position:10% line:89% align:start
What we want, we simply take.

00:22:06.143 --> 00:22:08.612 position:7% line:89% align:start
Without permission from anyone.

00:22:08.645 --> 00:22:10.280 position:19% line:89% align:start
It's not really wrong.

00:22:10.314 --> 00:22:11.348 position:24% line:89% align:start
Mattis told me so.

00:22:13.117 --> 00:22:15.985 position:13% line:83% align:start
See those beans, that whole
bag was taken as well.

00:22:16.018 --> 00:22:17.621 position:16% line:83% align:start
We took them from a band
of traveling merchants

00:22:17.654 --> 00:22:19.490 position:27% line:89% align:start
out in the woods.

00:22:22.392 --> 00:22:26.596 position:16% line:83% align:start
But Lovis baked that loaf
of bread that I gave to you.

00:22:28.231 --> 00:22:29.565 position:33% line:89% align:start
And why not?

00:22:29.599 --> 00:22:31.634 position:30% line:83% align:start
I'm only doing
what I've learned.

00:22:31.667 --> 00:22:34.069 position:13% line:89% align:start
Birk, don't worry yourself.
