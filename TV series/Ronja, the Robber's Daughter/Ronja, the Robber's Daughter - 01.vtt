00:02:18.641 --> 00:02:20.009 position:16% line:89% align:start

But not for you.

If you value your lives,

leave all your belongings

00:03:26.112 --> 00:03:27.379 position:38% line:89% align:start

- Borka? You good for nothing.

00:03:56.877 --> 00:04:00.013 position:33% line:83% align:start
- Mattis, you
shameless low life.

00:04:00.047 --> 00:04:02.716 position:21% line:83% align:start
- Borka, you foolish
bull, this is our turf.

00:04:02.749 --> 00:04:04.685 position:27% line:83% align:start
Hurry on back to
your own forest.

00:04:04.718 --> 00:04:05.986 position:24% line:83% align:start
- Oh, you think you
can just get away

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:08.689 position:30% line:83% align:start
with taking our
treasure from us?

00:04:08.722 --> 00:04:11.558 position:16% line:83% align:start
- You're the ones tryin'
to take it from us!

00:04:11.592 --> 00:04:13.727 position:21% line:83% align:start
- You lay one finger
on that treasure

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:17.097 position:24% line:83% align:start
and I'll plunge you
and your entire clan

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:19.600 position:16% line:89% align:start
into the depths of hell.

00:04:19.633 --> 00:04:21.535 position:24% line:83% align:start
- This loot happens
to belong to us.

00:04:21.568 --> 00:04:23.670 position:24% line:83% align:start
We've been tracking
that wagon before

00:04:23.704 --> 00:04:24.838 position:13% line:89% align:start
it even entered the forest.

00:04:24.872 --> 00:04:27.474 position:21% line:83% align:start
- There's no way I'm
letting you have it.

00:04:27.507 --> 00:04:28.742 position:27% line:89% align:start
- You want some?

00:04:28.775 --> 00:04:30.444 position:16% line:83% align:start
- Say that again and I'll
send you home crying.

00:04:30.477 --> 00:04:31.612 position:27% line:89% align:start
- That's my line.

00:04:31.645 --> 00:04:32.981 position:16% line:89% align:start
- Fine, stop your horse.

00:04:33.014 --> 00:04:34.514 position:19% line:89% align:start
- You stop your horse.

00:04:34.548 --> 00:04:35.683 position:24% line:89% align:start
- I said it first.

00:04:35.717 --> 00:04:37.518 position:13% line:89% align:start
- Well, I thought it first.

00:04:37.552 --> 00:04:38.186 position:27% line:89% align:start
- You're a toad.

00:04:38.219 --> 00:04:40.088 position:19% line:89% align:start
- You're a toad bottom.

00:04:45.593 --> 00:04:46.427 position:41% line:89% align:start
- Ahh!

00:04:48.029 --> 00:04:49.464 position:30% line:89% align:start
- Chief! Chief!

00:04:53.735 --> 00:04:55.703 position:35% line:89% align:start
(grunting)

00:04:55.737 --> 00:04:57.039 position:19% line:89% align:start
- Let go of my tongue!

00:04:57.072 --> 00:04:59.607 position:10% line:89% align:start
- Chief, quick! It's serious!

00:05:00.708 --> 00:05:02.778 position:35% line:89% align:start
(grunting)

00:05:02.811 --> 00:05:03.913 position:30% line:89% align:start
- [Both] Whoa!

00:05:03.946 --> 00:05:05.981 position:16% line:89% align:start
- Serious, eh? I hope so.

00:05:06.015 --> 00:05:07.783 position:24% line:83% align:start
I was just about to
get the better of him.

00:05:07.816 --> 00:05:08.617 position:33% line:89% align:start
- Not likely.

00:05:12.755 --> 00:05:15.124 position:30% line:89% align:start
(birds crying)

00:05:22.032 --> 00:05:24.700 position:30% line:89% align:start
(water flowing)

00:05:30.506 --> 00:05:32.508 position:27% line:89% align:start
- Mattis! Quick!

00:05:34.744 --> 00:05:37.213 position:5% line:89% align:start
Faster, they're waiting for you.

00:05:38.682 --> 00:05:40.517 position:35% line:89% align:start
- Yah, yah!

00:05:41.584 --> 00:05:44.621 position:24% line:83% align:start
- Go now, as quick
as you can. Go!

00:05:44.654 --> 00:05:47.224 position:27% line:89% align:start
(horse galloping)

00:05:51.628 --> 00:05:52.729 position:35% line:89% align:start
- Yah, yah!

00:06:00.838 --> 00:06:02.974 position:38% line:89% align:start
(thunder)

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:04.809 position:41% line:89% align:start

00:06:12.116 --> 00:06:14.485 position:38% line:89% align:start
(thunder)

00:06:18.956 --> 00:06:20.591 position:30% line:89% align:start

00:06:20.624 --> 00:06:22.560 position:24% line:89% align:start
Oy, open the doors.

00:06:23.996 --> 00:06:26.764 position:27% line:89% align:start
(doors creaking)

00:06:30.002 --> 00:06:31.903 position:38% line:89% align:start

00:06:33.739 --> 00:06:34.873 position:38% line:89% align:start
- Oh my.

00:06:36.742 --> 00:06:37.709 position:38% line:89% align:start
- Lovis.

00:06:37.743 --> 00:06:38.744 position:41% line:89% align:start
Lovis.

00:06:38.777 --> 00:06:39.544 position:41% line:89% align:start
Lovis.

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:46.585 position:41% line:89% align:start
Lovis!

00:06:47.686 --> 00:06:49.688 position:13% line:89% align:start
Noddle-Pete, where's Lovis?

00:06:49.721 --> 00:06:54.260 position:21% line:83% align:start
- (Laughs) Upstairs,
where else would she be?

00:06:54.293 --> 00:06:56.062 position:19% line:89% align:start
- Oh yeah, good point.

00:06:57.796 --> 00:07:00.665 position:30% line:89% align:start
- (Laughs) Yep.

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:03.269 position:38% line:89% align:start

00:07:05.972 --> 00:07:08.241 position:35% line:89% align:start
(hollering)

00:07:16.049 --> 00:07:18.051 position:41% line:89% align:start
Lovis!

00:07:24.224 --> 00:07:26.559 position:38% line:89% align:start
(panting)

00:07:28.095 --> 00:07:29.695 position:27% line:89% align:start
Has he been born?

00:07:31.031 --> 00:07:33.000 position:24% line:89% align:start
- Oh, the baby? No.

00:07:33.033 --> 00:07:36.336 position:21% line:83% align:start
- I heard you were in
agony and struggling,

00:07:36.370 --> 00:07:37.738 position:27% line:89% align:start
groaning in pain.

00:07:40.774 --> 00:07:43.744 position:21% line:83% align:start
- The baby will come
when it's ready to come

00:07:43.777 --> 00:07:45.313 position:16% line:89% align:start
and not a moment before.

00:07:45.346 --> 00:07:47.681 position:10% line:89% align:start
Waiting here is all I can do.

00:07:49.950 --> 00:07:52.120 position:38% line:89% align:start
(panting)

00:07:58.725 --> 00:08:01.362 position:27% line:89% align:start

(bird laughing)

00:08:29.458 --> 00:08:32.727 position:21% line:89% align:start
- [Lovis] (grunting)

00:08:41.270 --> 00:08:43.305 position:27% line:83% align:start
Let me have some
quiet for our baby.

00:08:43.339 --> 00:08:44.874 position:19% line:89% align:start
So it can hear me sing.

00:08:44.907 --> 00:08:47.910 position:24% line:83% align:start
Go and drive those
nasty harpies away.

00:08:47.943 --> 00:08:50.913 position:19% line:83% align:start
- You wanna sing a song
while giving birth?

00:08:52.815 --> 00:08:56.785 position:21% line:83% align:start
- I think it might be
easier that way and besides,

00:08:56.819 --> 00:08:59.422 position:19% line:83% align:start
the baby would turn out
all the joyer if it arrived

00:08:59.456 --> 00:09:02.125 position:5% line:89% align:start
on earth to the sound of a song.

00:09:02.159 --> 00:09:05.095 position:19% line:83% align:start
A quiet song, something
soothing, you know.

00:09:05.128 --> 00:09:06.263 position:30% line:89% align:start
Nice and calm.

00:09:07.164 --> 00:09:07.797 position:41% line:89% align:start
- Hmm?

00:09:10.433 --> 00:09:13.103 position:5% line:89% align:start
- Now hush those harpies! Go on!

00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:18.074 position:41% line:89% align:start
- I...

00:09:21.878 --> 00:09:23.947 position:38% line:89% align:start
- (Sigh)

00:09:27.018 --> 00:09:29.786 position:30% line:89% align:start
(birds crying)

00:09:35.493 --> 00:09:38.162 position:19% line:89% align:start

Tonight when you should be

00:10:15.867 --> 00:10:18.036 position:27% line:89% align:start
A baby of storms.

00:10:18.538 --> 00:10:20.038 position:27% line:89% align:start
Ugly as thunder.

00:12:45.690 --> 00:12:47.558 position:33% line:83% align:start
I'm an expert

What we're supposed
to be quiet when

00:12:52.563 --> 00:12:54.998 position:16% line:89% align:start
a baby's being born then?

00:12:55.031 --> 00:12:59.604 position:13% line:83% align:start

knows that, uh, well,

00:12:59.637 --> 00:13:01.239 position:33% line:89% align:start
I'm not sure.

00:13:13.117 --> 00:13:16.688 position:10% line:83% align:start
I'm old and I'd like to meet
this child before I'm through

00:13:16.722 --> 00:13:20.559 position:16% line:83% align:start

it, could be any moment now

00:13:20.592 --> 00:13:22.628 position:27% line:89% align:start
or precisely now.

My good men,

I'm a father!

00:13:40.479 --> 00:13:42.448 position:38% line:89% align:start
Yay! Yay!

00:13:44.183 --> 00:13:46.118 position:27% line:89% align:start
- I have a child.

00:13:46.151 --> 00:13:48.120 position:30% line:89% align:start
I am a father!

00:13:48.721 --> 00:13:50.055 position:16% line:89% align:start
- Is it a boy or a girl?

00:13:50.088 --> 00:13:51.123 position:35% line:89% align:start
What then?

00:13:52.157 --> 00:13:54.026 position:21% line:89% align:start
- Happiness and joy.

00:13:54.059 --> 00:13:55.228 position:33% line:89% align:start
It's a girl.

00:13:55.261 --> 00:13:56.196 position:33% line:89% align:start
- [All] Huh?

00:13:59.666 --> 00:14:01.334 position:21% line:89% align:start
- Wait, here she is.

00:14:02.502 --> 00:14:05.538 position:27% line:89% align:start
(soft calm music)

00:14:08.141 --> 00:14:11.578 position:19% line:83% align:start
Now my friends, behold
a robber's daughter.

00:14:11.612 --> 00:14:14.582 position:27% line:89% align:start
(soft calm music)

00:14:32.833 --> 00:14:34.568 position:30% line:89% align:start
Hey, hey, hey!

00:14:34.602 --> 00:14:38.672 position:13% line:83% align:start
Come here and see the most
beautiful girl in the world.

00:14:38.707 --> 00:14:40.574 position:16% line:89% align:start
- [Female] I told you so.

00:14:40.608 --> 00:14:42.109 position:30% line:89% align:start
- [Male] Hello.

00:14:42.142 --> 00:14:43.645 position:24% line:89% align:start
- [Male 2] So cute.

00:14:46.515 --> 00:14:49.016 position:33% line:89% align:start
(baby cooing)

00:14:57.659 --> 00:15:00.195 position:10% line:89% align:start
- Oh, look how smart she is.

00:15:00.228 --> 00:15:02.097 position:24% line:89% align:start
You can just tell.

00:15:02.130 --> 00:15:04.633 position:27% line:83% align:start
- Eh, what's her
name then Mattis?

00:15:06.101 --> 00:15:09.538 position:19% line:83% align:start
- (Clearing throat) You
could ask the mother.

00:15:09.571 --> 00:15:13.508 position:24% line:83% align:start
I decided long ago
the name is Ronja.

00:15:13.542 --> 00:15:17.480 position:19% line:83% align:start
- But how did you know
it was gonna be a girl?

00:15:18.814 --> 00:15:21.784 position:21% line:83% align:start
- I didn't, however,
Ronja was what I decided

00:15:21.817 --> 00:15:24.420 position:27% line:83% align:start
so it was always
going to be Ronja.

00:15:24.453 --> 00:15:26.489 position:33% line:89% align:start
- (Laughter)

00:15:26.522 --> 00:15:29.125 position:5% line:89% align:start
- Will you hand Ronja to me now?

00:15:30.660 --> 00:15:32.662 position:16% line:89% align:start
Did you hear me, Mattis?

00:15:34.230 --> 00:15:36.732 position:33% line:89% align:start
(baby cooing)

00:15:38.334 --> 00:15:40.503 position:24% line:83% align:start
- Ah, Ronja, you're
already holding my heart

00:15:40.536 --> 00:15:42.873 position:13% line:89% align:start
in your tiny little hands.

00:15:42.906 --> 00:15:45.274 position:33% line:89% align:start
(baby cooing)

00:15:46.510 --> 00:15:50.847 position:19% line:83% align:start
I do not understand it
but that's how it is.

00:15:50.881 --> 00:15:53.750 position:27% line:83% align:start
- Mattis, could I
hold her for a bit?

00:15:53.784 --> 00:15:55.352 position:41% line:89% align:start
Mattis?

00:15:55.385 --> 00:15:56.653 position:21% line:83% align:start
- Huh, of course, you
can hold the baby.

00:15:56.687 --> 00:16:01.325 position:13% line:83% align:start
The next robber chieftain,
I present her to you.

00:16:01.358 --> 00:16:02.826 position:5% line:89% align:start
Here, now listen my good friend,

00:16:02.859 --> 00:16:06.229 position:21% line:83% align:start
if you drop her like
a loaf of bread,

00:16:06.263 --> 00:16:08.632 position:5% line:89% align:start
I will drop you from this world.

00:16:11.301 --> 00:16:12.603 position:24% line:89% align:start
- Look at you, eh?

00:16:12.637 --> 00:16:14.606 position:10% line:89% align:start
You're as light as a feather.

00:16:14.639 --> 00:16:15.405 position:41% line:89% align:start
Oh! Oh!

00:16:18.308 --> 00:16:20.545 position:27% line:83% align:start
- Give her back,
you foolish old man!

00:16:20.578 --> 00:16:21.679 position:33% line:89% align:start
How dare you?

00:16:21.713 --> 00:16:23.348 position:16% line:89% align:start
What were you expecting,

00:16:23.381 --> 00:16:26.684 position:21% line:83% align:start
some lumbering robber
giant with a pointy beard?

00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:32.624 position:21% line:83% align:start
- Mattis' daughter is
our finest treasure!

00:16:32.657 --> 00:16:36.494 position:27% line:83% align:start
- And nobody can
match her beauty.

00:16:36.527 --> 00:16:38.563 position:7% line:89% align:start
- The loveliest of the forest!

00:16:38.596 --> 00:16:39.798 position:30% line:89% align:start
- That's right!

00:16:46.739 --> 00:16:49.408 position:5% line:89% align:start
- Alright then, let's celebrate.

00:16:50.609 --> 00:16:53.177 position:33% line:89% align:start
- [All] Yay!

00:16:57.616 --> 00:16:59.585 position:38% line:89% align:start
(thunder)

00:17:01.286 --> 00:17:03.689 position:13% line:89% align:start

00:17:03.722 --> 00:17:06.291 position:30% line:89% align:start
(upbeat music)

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:15.602 position:24% line:89% align:start
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

00:17:20.974 --> 00:17:22.442 position:27% line:89% align:start
- Dinner's here.

00:17:22.475 --> 00:17:24.911 position:24% line:83% align:start
Don't feed the dog,
feed the (inaudible)!

00:17:24.944 --> 00:17:26.513 position:27% line:89% align:start
- [All] Ha ha ha!

00:17:30.917 --> 00:17:33.620 position:21% line:83% align:start
- Borka's going to be
sick with jealousy.

00:17:33.653 --> 00:17:37.557 position:10% line:83% align:start
I'll wager he'll be gnashing
his teeth at this news.

00:17:39.492 --> 00:17:42.395 position:19% line:83% align:start
- (Laughs) There'll be
such a gnashing that all

00:17:42.429 --> 00:17:45.700 position:21% line:83% align:start
the wild harpies and
great wolves in the woods

00:17:45.733 --> 00:17:48.669 position:13% line:89% align:start
will be holding their ears.

00:17:48.703 --> 00:17:49.670 position:30% line:89% align:start
- That's right.

00:17:51.539 --> 00:17:54.842 position:19% line:83% align:start
The pitiful Borka tree
bears no fruit.

00:17:54.875 --> 00:17:56.343 position:24% line:89% align:start
He is falling down.

00:17:57.578 --> 00:18:01.615 position:21% line:83% align:start
I say "Timber" to his
family tree! (laughs)

00:18:04.485 --> 00:18:07.321 position:27% line:89% align:start
- (Evil laughter)

00:18:21.069 --> 00:18:24.673 position:21% line:89% align:start
(thunderous pounding)

00:18:24.706 --> 00:18:25.474 position:38% line:89% align:start
- Ow, ow!

00:18:30.479 --> 00:18:31.379 position:35% line:89% align:start
- [All] Oh!

00:18:41.690 --> 00:18:44.694 position:27% line:83% align:start
- Well, that was
certainly close by.

00:18:45.928 --> 00:18:47.830 position:19% line:89% align:start
What a lightning crack!

00:18:47.864 --> 00:18:51.968 position:16% line:83% align:start
It's like a demon struck
a direct hit on this fort.

00:18:54.871 --> 00:18:57.473 position:33% line:89% align:start
(baby cries)

00:18:59.842 --> 00:19:02.545 position:16% line:89% align:start
- Oh, my child is crying.

00:19:02.578 --> 00:19:03.613 position:33% line:89% align:start
What do I do?

00:19:15.692 --> 00:19:18.695 position:24% line:89% align:start
(baby stops crying)

00:19:20.030 --> 00:19:22.866 position:27% line:89% align:start

00:19:52.697 --> 00:19:54.632 position:30% line:89% align:start
(wind howling)

00:19:56.067 --> 00:20:00.471 position:5% line:83% align:start
- Can you believe that lightning
smashed this place in two?

00:20:00.505 --> 00:20:02.774 position:7% line:89% align:start
- We should call it Hell's Gap.

00:20:02.807 --> 00:20:05.677 position:27% line:89% align:start
(dramatic music)

00:20:13.085 --> 00:20:15.821 position:16% line:89% align:start
- Hey, look at the chief.

00:20:19.424 --> 00:20:21.627 position:33% line:89% align:start
- (Growling)

00:20:23.662 --> 00:20:25.030 position:21% line:89% align:start
- Who can blame him?

00:20:25.064 --> 00:20:26.866 position:13% line:83% align:start
This fort's been a home to
his family for generations

00:20:26.899 --> 00:20:28.934 position:24% line:89% align:start
and now look at it.

00:20:28.968 --> 00:20:30.436 position:27% line:89% align:start
- I'm afraid to.

00:20:30.469 --> 00:20:33.005 position:24% line:83% align:start
If I look around, I
might catch Mattis' eye.

00:20:33.039 --> 00:20:34.740 position:21% line:83% align:start
- Don't worry, Mattis
doesn't have it in him

00:20:34.773 --> 00:20:38.111 position:24% line:83% align:start
to stay angry about
anything for too long.

00:20:38.144 --> 00:20:40.713 position:33% line:89% align:start
- (Growling)

00:20:43.817 --> 00:20:45.919 position:38% line:89% align:start
(laughs)

00:20:46.920 --> 00:20:48.154 position:30% line:89% align:start
- See? Told ya.

00:20:49.956 --> 00:20:52.893 position:10% line:89% align:start
- Alright, it could be worse.

00:20:52.926 --> 00:20:54.160 position:21% line:89% align:start
Remember Noddle-Pete,

00:20:54.194 --> 00:20:55.462 position:27% line:83% align:start
back to that time
you went missing

00:20:55.495 --> 00:20:57.564 position:13% line:89% align:start
in the vault for four days?

00:20:58.665 --> 00:21:02.836 position:24% line:83% align:start
- Oh, you shouldn't
remind me about that.

00:21:02.869 --> 00:21:06.974 position:13% line:83% align:start
I was merely tryin' to find
out how vast this fort was.

00:21:07.008 --> 00:21:10.577 position:27% line:83% align:start
I wandered up and
down and over and back

00:21:10.610 --> 00:21:14.048 position:24% line:83% align:start
and back and, well,
I sure found out.

00:21:14.081 --> 00:21:17.718 position:19% line:83% align:start
It's big enough to get
lost for four days.

00:21:20.588 --> 00:21:22.757 position:38% line:89% align:start
(moaning)

00:21:32.500 --> 00:21:34.702 position:24% line:83% align:start
- This place is too
big for us anyhow.

00:21:34.735 --> 00:21:36.537 position:13% line:89% align:start
We've got plenty of space.

00:21:36.570 --> 00:21:38.941 position:16% line:89% align:start
Who cares what happened.

00:21:38.974 --> 00:21:40.042 position:35% line:89% align:start
- Alright!

00:21:40.075 --> 00:21:41.475 position:27% line:89% align:start
- Yes, of course.

00:21:41.509 --> 00:21:42.978 position:24% line:83% align:start
- If you're happy,
we're happy, right?

00:21:43.011 --> 00:21:43.812 position:41% line:89% align:start
- Yeah!

00:21:43.845 --> 00:21:44.713 position:41% line:89% align:start
- Yeah.

00:21:44.746 --> 00:21:45.647 position:19% line:89% align:start
- Mm hmm (affirmative)

00:21:45.681 --> 00:21:47.950 position:16% line:89% align:start
- There's just one thing.

00:21:47.983 --> 00:21:51.553 position:16% line:89% align:start
- Oh chief, the outhouse!

00:21:52.921 --> 00:21:54.823 position:19% line:89% align:start
It's on the other side.

00:21:57.759 --> 00:22:00.430 position:33% line:89% align:start
(bird cawing)

00:22:01.897 --> 00:22:03.632 position:27% line:89% align:start
(stone crumbling)

00:22:03.665 --> 00:22:04.633 position:44% line:89% align:start
Ahhh!

00:22:06.535 --> 00:22:09.671 position:21% line:89% align:start
(thunderous pounding)

00:22:11.074 --> 00:22:12.641 position:44% line:89% align:start
Ahhh!

00:22:12.674 --> 00:22:16.112 position:16% line:83% align:start
- Better hold it until we
build a new one over here.

00:22:16.145 --> 00:22:17.246 position:30% line:89% align:start
- Oh, come on!

00:22:18.081 --> 00:22:20.550 position:35% line:89% align:start
(laughter)

00:22:30.093 --> 00:22:33.963 position:21% line:89% align:start
(slow soothing music)

00:22:33.997 --> 00:22:37.234 position:13% line:83% align:start
- Ronja, it looks like your
young life is already off

00:22:37.267 --> 00:22:39.702 position:7% line:89% align:start
to a dramatic start, isn't it?

00:22:41.571 --> 00:22:43.841 position:33% line:89% align:start
(baby cooing)

00:22:46.310 --> 00:22:49.680 position:21% line:89% align:start
(slow soothing music)

00:23:01.226 --> 00:23:04.762 position:19% line:83% align:start
- [Narrator] And so, a
new life was welcomed into

00:23:04.795 --> 00:23:07.831 position:7% line:89% align:start
the Mattis clan of the forest.

00:23:07.865 --> 00:23:10.001 position:24% line:89% align:start
Ronja was her name.

00:23:10.035 --> 00:23:12.603 position:10% line:89% align:start
Ronja, the Robber's Daughter.

00:23:20.779 --> 00:23:22.714 position:24% line:89% align:start
(fast upbeat music)

00:23:22.747 --> 00:23:25.183 position:24% line:83% align:start
Next time on Ronja,
the Robber's Daughter,

00:23:29.255 --> 00:23:31.257 position:13% line:89% align:start
"First Trip to the Forest".

00:23:32.791 --> 00:23:33.958 position:30% line:89% align:start
Don't miss it!

00:23:36.228 --> 00:23:39.764 position:19% line:89% align:start
(light whimsical music)
