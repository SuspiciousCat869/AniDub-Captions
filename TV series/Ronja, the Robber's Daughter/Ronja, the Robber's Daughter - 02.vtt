00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:52.563 position:24% line:89% align:start

(Ronja cooing)

00:09:57.603 --> 00:10:01.441 position:13% line:83% align:start

hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,

00:10:01.475 --> 00:10:03.410 position:16% line:89% align:start
hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

(tranquil music)

00:10:10.953 --> 00:10:11.654 position:38% line:89% align:start

(giggling)

00:10:17.328 --> 00:10:19.097 position:27% line:89% align:start
Oh my little one.

00:10:19.130 --> 00:10:21.233 position:27% line:83% align:start
Of all the babies
in all the world,

00:10:21.266 --> 00:10:25.438 position:24% line:83% align:start
I can't imagine any
crawling as well as you.

00:10:25.472 --> 00:10:28.376 position:21% line:83% align:start
- I'm very impressed
with her technique.

00:10:28.409 --> 00:10:32.080 position:24% line:83% align:start
Not many babies can
turn like that, mm, mm.

00:10:32.114 --> 00:10:35.183 position:27% line:83% align:start
- Not many babies
are Ronja, are they?

00:10:35.218 --> 00:10:37.019 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Ronja giggling)

00:10:37.053 --> 00:10:38.422 position:13% line:83% align:start
- Most babies can do that.
- You're so clever,

00:10:38.455 --> 00:10:40.491 position:16% line:89% align:start
yes you are, yes you are.

00:10:41.726 --> 00:10:45.096 position:19% line:83% align:start
- And Mr. Mattis, with
you busy babysitting,

00:10:45.130 --> 00:10:47.166 position:16% line:83% align:start
should we just let Borka
take over robbing the road?

00:10:47.199 --> 00:10:51.304 position:16% line:83% align:start
- Don't worry, I brought
back plenty of treasures.

00:10:55.610 --> 00:10:56.478 position:44% line:89% align:start
Look!

00:10:56.512 --> 00:10:59.047 position:35% line:89% align:start
(giggling)

00:10:59.081 --> 00:11:01.016 position:21% line:83% align:start
- Ronja, here's some
treasure from me.

00:11:01.049 --> 00:11:02.485 position:24% line:89% align:start
- Ah, and from me!

00:11:04.053 --> 00:11:06.223 position:10% line:89% align:start
- Oh yeah, you'll like this.

00:11:07.091 --> 00:11:09.361 position:35% line:89% align:start
(giggling)

00:11:15.067 --> 00:11:15.669 position:44% line:89% align:start
- Hm.

00:11:19.072 --> 00:11:20.608 position:27% line:89% align:start
- That's nothing.

00:11:20.642 --> 00:11:23.011 position:35% line:89% align:start
(grunting)

00:11:26.616 --> 00:11:27.451 position:41% line:89% align:start
Ronja.

00:11:29.152 --> 00:11:32.089 position:38% line:83% align:start
No, one.
(rustling)

00:11:33.792 --> 00:11:34.526 position:35% line:89% align:start
Ha, ta-da!

(Pelje laughing)
(Robbers groaning)

00:11:43.537 --> 00:11:45.373 position:33% line:83% align:start
- What do you
think you're doing!

00:11:45.407 --> 00:11:47.375 position:27% line:89% align:start
Get that outside!

00:11:47.409 --> 00:11:49.045 position:35% line:89% align:start
(laughing)

00:11:49.078 --> 00:11:52.048 position:27% line:89% align:start

(babbling)

00:13:10.716 --> 00:13:11.550 position:41% line:89% align:start
Ronja!

00:13:12.785 --> 00:13:16.121 position:33% line:83% align:start
You're like a
beautiful little Harpy.

00:13:16.155 --> 00:13:18.726 position:21% line:83% align:start
Like their feathers,
you're just as soft,

00:13:18.759 --> 00:13:21.529 position:24% line:83% align:start
and as dark-haired,
but so pretty.

00:13:22.631 --> 00:13:24.232 position:35% line:89% align:start
Am I right?

00:13:24.266 --> 00:13:24.867 position:35% line:89% align:start
Am I right!

00:13:24.901 --> 00:13:26.101 position:27% line:89% align:start
- [Robbers] Yes!

00:13:27.337 --> 00:13:29.339 position:16% line:83% align:start
- [Mattis] You never saw
such a splendid child

00:13:29.372 --> 00:13:31.208 position:19% line:89% align:start
in all your lives, yes?

00:13:32.343 --> 00:13:33.912 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yes?

00:13:33.945 --> 00:13:36.247 position:27% line:89% align:start
- [Robbers] Yes!

00:13:36.281 --> 00:13:39.518 position:38% line:83% align:start
- Eh, oh!
(Ronja giggling)

00:13:45.927 --> 00:13:46.895 position:30% line:89% align:start
Such a beauty!

00:13:47.863 --> 00:13:50.232 position:38% line:89% align:start
(humming)

00:13:56.741 --> 00:13:59.176 position:35% line:89% align:start

(grunting)

00:14:11.292 --> 00:14:12.560 position:27% line:89% align:start
- [Robbers] Hey!

00:14:13.929 --> 00:14:16.399 position:35% line:89% align:start
(chanting)

00:14:18.535 --> 00:14:19.403 position:35% line:89% align:start
- [All] Ha!

00:14:19.436 --> 00:14:20.237 position:35% line:89% align:start
(chanting)

00:14:20.270 --> 00:14:22.774 position:30% line:89% align:start
(lively music)

00:14:27.479 --> 00:14:28.313 position:41% line:89% align:start
Oh ah!

00:14:31.418 --> 00:14:32.252 position:41% line:89% align:start
Oh ah!

00:14:34.823 --> 00:14:37.426 position:16% line:83% align:start
- The older you get, the
quicker time goes by.

00:14:37.459 --> 00:14:40.997 position:13% line:83% align:start
The days seemed to drag on
forever, now they fly past.

00:14:41.031 --> 00:14:44.935 position:19% line:83% align:start
In the blink of an eye,
she's all grown up.

00:14:44.969 --> 00:14:48.606 position:16% line:83% align:start
- [Lovis] It's true, but
she'll always be my baby.

00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:49.407 position:41% line:89% align:start
- Hmm?

00:14:55.649 --> 00:14:58.986 position:19% line:89% align:start
(laughing and cheering)

00:15:14.907 --> 00:15:17.744 position:27% line:89% align:start

(oinking)

00:15:34.499 --> 00:15:36.367 position:30% line:89% align:start
- Good morning!

00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:37.736 position:21% line:89% align:start
Morning, Noddle-Pete!

00:15:37.770 --> 00:15:39.037 position:27% line:89% align:start
- Morning to you.

00:15:39.071 --> 00:15:40.572 position:5% line:89% align:start
- [Ronja] Good morning, Sturkas!

00:15:40.606 --> 00:15:41.875 position:30% line:89% align:start
- Good morning!

00:15:41.908 --> 00:15:43.978 position:19% line:89% align:start
- [Ronja] Jutis, Turre!

00:15:44.011 --> 00:15:45.012 position:35% line:83% align:start
- Hey, hey.
- Ha.

00:15:45.045 --> 00:15:47.314 position:27% line:89% align:start
- [Ronja] Pelje!

00:15:47.348 --> 00:15:48.683 position:27% line:89% align:start
- Morning, Ronja!

00:15:48.717 --> 00:15:49.818 position:27% line:89% align:start
- [Ronja] Knotas!

00:15:49.851 --> 00:15:50.652 position:33% line:89% align:start
- All right.

00:15:50.685 --> 00:15:52.855 position:35% line:89% align:start
(bleating)

00:15:54.690 --> 00:15:56.894 position:10% line:89% align:start
- [Ronja] Joen, good morning!

00:15:58.062 --> 00:15:58.897 position:44% line:89% align:start
- Hm.

00:15:59.931 --> 00:16:01.566 position:27% line:89% align:start
Oh, good morning!

00:16:05.138 --> 00:16:07.040 position:27% line:89% align:start
- Go on, eat up.

00:16:07.073 --> 00:16:09.342 position:35% line:89% align:start
(pattering)

00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:23.394 position:41% line:89% align:start
- Hmm.

00:16:26.898 --> 00:16:28.533 position:27% line:89% align:start
(milk squirting)

00:16:28.567 --> 00:16:30.403 position:35% line:89% align:start
(bleating)

00:16:30.436 --> 00:16:33.574 position:24% line:83% align:start
- [Lovis] Something
on your mind, Mattis?

00:16:33.607 --> 00:16:37.011 position:24% line:83% align:start
- Lovis, our child
must go to the forest,

00:16:37.045 --> 00:16:39.949 position:27% line:83% align:start
to know what it's
like out there.

00:16:39.982 --> 00:16:42.886 position:13% line:89% align:start
Don't you think it's time?

00:16:42.919 --> 00:16:46.023 position:24% line:83% align:start
- Of course, what a
great idea Mattis.

00:16:48.559 --> 00:16:51.129 position:16% line:83% align:start
And it's nice to see you
figured it out by yourself.

00:16:51.163 --> 00:16:52.764 position:7% line:89% align:start
You know, if it were up to me,

00:16:52.798 --> 00:16:55.101 position:19% line:83% align:start
it would have happened
a long time ago.

00:16:55.134 --> 00:16:59.039 position:27% line:83% align:start
(milk squirting)
(bleating)

00:17:02.010 --> 00:17:05.047 position:30% line:89% align:start
(Mattis sighs)

00:17:05.081 --> 00:17:06.916 position:27% line:89% align:start
- [Mattis] Ronja!

00:17:06.949 --> 00:17:07.951 position:33% line:89% align:start
- Yes Father?

00:17:10.454 --> 00:17:11.890 position:27% line:89% align:start
Look at them all!

00:17:12.924 --> 00:17:16.061 position:27% line:83% align:start
You think one of
them might hatch?

00:17:16.095 --> 00:17:18.999 position:30% line:83% align:start
- Only if it's
ready to come out.

00:17:20.233 --> 00:17:21.101 position:44% line:89% align:start
- Hm?

00:17:21.134 --> 00:17:22.803 position:27% line:89% align:start
(peaceful music)

00:17:22.837 --> 00:17:25.106 position:35% line:89% align:start
(crunching)

00:17:29.979 --> 00:17:32.148 position:38% line:89% align:start
(gasping)

00:17:37.222 --> 00:17:39.090 position:21% line:89% align:start
- Here's your lunch.

00:17:42.228 --> 00:17:44.932 position:16% line:89% align:start
- This'll be so much fun.

00:17:44.965 --> 00:17:45.732 position:35% line:89% align:start
Here I go!

00:17:46.566 --> 00:17:48.468 position:19% line:89% align:start
- Mm-hmm, there you go.

00:17:53.242 --> 00:17:54.076 position:38% line:89% align:start
Hmm, hmm.

00:18:01.118 --> 00:18:03.088 position:38% line:89% align:start
(gasping)

00:18:07.093 --> 00:18:09.729 position:35% line:89% align:start
(scraping)

00:18:09.762 --> 00:18:11.865 position:38% line:89% align:start
(gasping)

00:18:17.173 --> 00:18:19.175 position:19% line:89% align:start
- [Noddle-Pete] Mm-hm.

00:18:19.208 --> 00:18:22.179 position:19% line:89% align:start
(Noddle-Pete laughing)

00:18:25.016 --> 00:18:27.018 position:16% line:89% align:start
- Father, I'm going now.

00:18:28.854 --> 00:18:31.191 position:5% line:89% align:start
- Ronja, you need to be careful.

00:18:31.224 --> 00:18:34.661 position:21% line:83% align:start
The forest, it's full
of Borka Robbers,

00:18:34.694 --> 00:18:37.531 position:13% line:89% align:start
Wild Harpies, Gray Dwarves.

00:18:37.565 --> 00:18:40.068 position:7% line:89% align:start
You need to watch out for them.

00:18:40.102 --> 00:18:42.138 position:13% line:83% align:start
- Yes, but how will I know
which ones are Borka Robbers,

00:18:42.171 --> 00:18:44.107 position:24% line:83% align:start
which ones are Wild
Harpies, and um,

00:18:44.140 --> 00:18:47.244 position:27% line:83% align:start
the Gray Dwarves,
which ones are those?

00:18:47.277 --> 00:18:51.316 position:10% line:89% align:start
- Uh, well, you'll find out.

00:18:51.349 --> 00:18:53.018 position:21% line:89% align:start
- Fine, good advice.

00:18:54.652 --> 00:18:56.088 position:27% line:89% align:start
- One more thing.

00:18:57.590 --> 00:19:00.127 position:24% line:83% align:start
Um, don't get lost
or go too far.

00:19:01.695 --> 00:19:04.266 position:16% line:83% align:start
- How will I know if I'm
lost or if I've gone too far?

00:19:04.299 --> 00:19:07.136 position:13% line:83% align:start
- Don't go beyond the lake
and stick to the path.

00:19:07.169 --> 00:19:08.838 position:24% line:89% align:start
- Also good advice.

00:19:10.073 --> 00:19:13.677 position:19% line:83% align:start
- [Mattis] And try not
to fall in the river.

00:19:13.711 --> 00:19:15.280 position:30% line:83% align:start
- Of course, no
falling into the river,

00:19:15.313 --> 00:19:17.315 position:27% line:89% align:start
but what if I do?

00:19:17.349 --> 00:19:18.784 position:27% line:89% align:start
- [Mattis] Swim.

00:19:19.684 --> 00:19:22.088 position:16% line:89% align:start
- [Ronja] Hmm, all right.

00:19:22.121 --> 00:19:24.358 position:16% line:83% align:start
- And please Ronja, watch
that you don't tumble

00:19:24.391 --> 00:19:25.859 position:27% line:89% align:start
into Hell's Gap.

00:19:27.295 --> 00:19:31.667 position:13% line:83% align:start
- Don't worry, I'll try not
to, but what if I do fall?

00:19:34.838 --> 00:19:36.307 position:21% line:89% align:start
- If that happens...

00:19:38.109 --> 00:19:40.144 position:19% line:89% align:start
- And if that happens?

00:19:42.281 --> 00:19:45.785 position:19% line:89% align:start
(inhaling and exhaling)

00:19:45.819 --> 00:19:48.089 position:35% line:89% align:start
(screaming)

00:19:54.963 --> 00:19:58.034 position:24% line:83% align:start
- Oh, you'll never
do anything again.

00:20:02.072 --> 00:20:04.209 position:35% line:89% align:start
(screaming)

00:20:05.043 --> 00:20:10.317 position:24% line:89% align:start
No, no, no, no, no!

00:20:13.053 --> 00:20:15.089 position:24% line:83% align:start
- Fine, don't fall
into Hell's Gap.

00:20:15.123 --> 00:20:16.691 position:19% line:83% align:start
Do you want to tell me
about anything else?

00:20:16.724 --> 00:20:18.360 position:19% line:89% align:start
Or is that everything?

00:20:18.393 --> 00:20:20.396 position:10% line:89% align:start
Because I really want to go.

00:20:20.430 --> 00:20:23.366 position:24% line:89% align:start
(breathing heavily)

00:20:24.968 --> 00:20:26.203 position:27% line:89% align:start
- Yeah, there is.

00:20:28.706 --> 00:20:30.408 position:27% line:83% align:start
But you'll learn
as you go along,

00:20:30.442 --> 00:20:33.279 position:27% line:83% align:start
and I'll see you
when you get home.

00:20:42.324 --> 00:20:43.691 position:30% line:89% align:start
Enough, go on.

00:20:45.161 --> 00:20:46.196 position:38% line:89% align:start
- Mm-hmm.

00:20:53.738 --> 00:20:56.275 position:27% line:89% align:start
(doors creaking)

00:20:59.179 --> 00:21:01.916 position:27% line:89% align:start
(dramatic music)

00:21:08.491 --> 00:21:10.860 position:38% line:89% align:start
(gasping)

00:21:33.423 --> 00:21:36.025 position:24% line:89% align:start
(excited screaming)

00:21:36.059 --> 00:21:38.229 position:35% line:89% align:start
(laughing)

00:21:41.065 --> 00:21:45.404 position:19% line:83% align:start
- And come home before
it gets too dark!

00:21:45.438 --> 00:21:47.273 position:19% line:89% align:start
- Don't worry, I will!

00:21:54.215 --> 00:21:56.151 position:10% line:89% align:start
- Time for us to go, as well.

00:21:56.185 --> 00:21:57.253 position:27% line:89% align:start
- [Robbers] Yes!

00:21:58.588 --> 00:21:59.422 position:35% line:89% align:start
- Hm, hey.

00:22:04.862 --> 00:22:05.930 position:33% line:89% align:start
- It's Ronja.

00:22:07.165 --> 00:22:08.467 position:41% line:89% align:start
Ronja!

00:22:08.500 --> 00:22:11.504 position:21% line:83% align:start
Where are you going,
all on your own?

00:22:17.111 --> 00:22:18.246 position:24% line:83% align:start
- [Ronja] I'm going
to the forest!

00:22:18.280 --> 00:22:20.015 position:10% line:89% align:start
It's my first time out there!

00:22:20.048 --> 00:22:21.149 position:30% line:89% align:start
Here I go, bye!

00:22:22.385 --> 00:22:24.353 position:16% line:83% align:start
- You're aware the forest
is full of Harpies,

00:22:24.388 --> 00:22:27.525 position:19% line:83% align:start
also Gray Dwarves, and
scary Borka Robbers.

00:22:27.558 --> 00:22:31.195 position:21% line:83% align:start
- [Ronja] Yes, Mattis
told me that, bye!

00:22:31.229 --> 00:22:33.932 position:30% line:89% align:start
(lively music)

00:22:46.181 --> 00:22:48.351 position:38% line:89% align:start
(gasping)

00:23:00.099 --> 00:23:02.336 position:35% line:89% align:start
(laughing)

00:23:06.307 --> 00:23:07.909 position:35% line:89% align:start
(grunting)

00:23:07.942 --> 00:23:10.179 position:35% line:89% align:start
(laughing)

00:23:10.212 --> 00:23:12.147 position:19% line:83% align:start
- [Narrator] And so for
the first time ever,

00:23:12.181 --> 00:23:15.285 position:10% line:83% align:start
after years of living inside
the safety of the fort,

00:23:15.318 --> 00:23:20.057 position:21% line:83% align:start
Ronja headed into the
forest, all on her own.

00:23:22.961 --> 00:23:26.232 position:24% line:83% align:start
Next time on Ronja,
The Robber's Daughter,

00:23:30.338 --> 00:23:32.140 position:21% line:89% align:start
"Fear in the Forest".

00:23:34.109 --> 00:23:36.145 position:30% line:89% align:start
Don't miss it.

00:23:36.178 --> 00:23:38.515 position:30% line:89% align:start
(lively music)
