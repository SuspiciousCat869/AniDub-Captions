- Ronja!

00:01:40.925 --> 00:01:43.259 position:21% line:83% align:start
- [Narrator] A narrow
escape from Greedy Falls

00:01:43.293 --> 00:01:45.762 position:13% line:89% align:start
saw Ronja and Birk return,

00:01:45.795 --> 00:01:50.165 position:24% line:83% align:start
exhausted but safe,
to the bear's cave.

00:01:50.199 --> 00:01:53.235 position:27% line:83% align:start
They found Lovis
waiting for them.

00:01:55.304 --> 00:01:58.306 position:21% line:83% align:start
Again, Ronja refused
to return home.

00:02:00.976 --> 00:02:03.244 position:16% line:89% align:start
But autumn was upon them.

00:02:04.379 --> 00:02:06.547 position:21% line:83% align:start
The trees were alight
with warm colors,

00:02:06.581 --> 00:02:09.516 position:30% line:83% align:start
while the wind
snapped with a chill.

00:02:14.554 --> 00:02:17.491 position:24% line:89% align:start
(thunder rumbling)

00:02:23.929 --> 00:02:27.198 position:19% line:89% align:start
(somber ambient music)

00:02:47.518 --> 00:02:50.186 position:30% line:89% align:start
(ice crackling)

00:03:09.938 --> 00:03:12.107 position:38% line:89% align:start
(screams)

00:03:15.977 --> 00:03:17.978 position:41% line:89% align:start
(gasps)

00:03:30.957 --> 00:03:33.727 position:27% line:89% align:start
(rain pattering)

00:03:44.603 --> 00:03:45.436 position:41% line:89% align:start
- Birk!

00:03:50.441 --> 00:03:53.945 position:21% line:83% align:start
- I went to find some
dry firewood for us.

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:17.633 position:21% line:89% align:start
(somber piano music)

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:27.909 position:19% line:89% align:start
(water drops plunking)

00:04:41.922 --> 00:04:45.324 position:19% line:83% align:start
Oh it's a rainy summer
that we're having.

00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:52.731 position:24% line:83% align:start
Although, I'm sure
it'll get better.

00:04:58.103 --> 00:05:00.906 position:30% line:89% align:start
(wind blowing)

00:05:08.412 --> 00:05:11.581 position:24% line:83% align:start
It's a windy summer
that we're having.

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:17.420 position:19% line:83% align:start
Although, I'm sure that
it will get better.

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:45.645 position:21% line:83% align:start
It's a frosty summer
that we're having.

00:05:45.679 --> 00:05:46.446 position:35% line:89% align:start
Although...

00:05:52.185 --> 00:05:56.122 position:21% line:83% align:start
My sister isn't happy
and I think I know why.

00:06:00.826 --> 00:06:03.394 position:30% line:83% align:start
Maybe it's time
for you to leave.

00:06:03.428 --> 00:06:05.898 position:21% line:83% align:start
You can warm yourself
by another fire.

00:06:05.931 --> 00:06:09.467 position:24% line:83% align:start
A fire that we know
doesn't belong to me.

00:06:19.943 --> 00:06:21.979 position:30% line:89% align:start
- Another fire?

00:06:22.012 --> 00:06:23.814 position:7% line:89% align:start
As I'm no longer Mattis' child,

00:06:23.847 --> 00:06:25.916 position:10% line:89% align:start
there's no other fire for me.

00:06:25.949 --> 00:06:26.884 position:33% line:89% align:start
Not anymore.

00:06:33.122 --> 00:06:37.492 position:10% line:83% align:start
- Once I get the fire going,
I'll catch up with you.

00:06:54.241 --> 00:06:56.442 position:41% line:89% align:start
(gasps)

00:07:01.481 --> 00:07:03.650 position:38% line:89% align:start
(sobbing)

00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:21.099 position:30% line:89% align:start
(clears throat)

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.169 position:38% line:89% align:start
(screams)

00:07:27.004 --> 00:07:29.173 position:38% line:89% align:start
(sobbing)

00:07:31.574 --> 00:07:34.145 position:30% line:89% align:start
(upbeat music)

00:07:40.083 --> 00:07:43.552 position:24% line:89% align:start
- Ronja, my child.

00:07:44.586 --> 00:07:48.090 position:16% line:89% align:start
I have my Ronja! (laughs)

00:07:54.229 --> 00:07:59.167 position:7% line:89% align:start
- Am I your child now, Mattis?

00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:02.602 position:10% line:89% align:start
Am I really your child again?

00:08:05.973 --> 00:08:06.773 position:41% line:89% align:start
- Yes.

00:08:07.841 --> 00:08:11.845 position:24% line:83% align:start
As you always have
been, my Ronja.

00:08:11.878 --> 00:08:12.946 position:38% line:89% align:start
My child!

00:08:14.081 --> 00:08:17.850 position:30% line:83% align:start
For whom I have
wept night and day.

00:08:17.883 --> 00:08:20.987 position:30% line:83% align:start
You don't know
how I've suffered.

00:08:21.020 --> 00:08:24.056 position:21% line:83% align:start
I've missed you with
all of my heart.

00:08:30.228 --> 00:08:34.132 position:16% line:83% align:start
Lovis said to me that you
would come back to us,

00:08:34.165 --> 00:08:36.267 position:19% line:89% align:start
if only I were to ask.

00:08:36.301 --> 00:08:37.534 position:33% line:89% align:start
Is she right?

00:08:47.877 --> 00:08:49.846 position:24% line:89% align:start
Is it true, Ronja?

00:08:49.879 --> 00:08:51.881 position:24% line:83% align:start
Will you come back
home with me, now?

00:08:51.914 --> 00:08:53.216 position:27% line:89% align:start
Back to the fort?

00:08:53.249 --> 00:08:55.018 position:19% line:89% align:start
Please say yes, Ronja.

00:08:59.588 --> 00:09:00.555 position:30% line:89% align:start
Come on Ronja.

00:09:02.257 --> 00:09:04.793 position:27% line:89% align:start
Let's go now, hm?

00:09:06.194 --> 00:09:08.763 position:30% line:89% align:start
(wind blowing)

00:09:20.074 --> 00:09:22.709 position:16% line:83% align:start
Although I haven't asked
you to come home yet,

00:09:22.742 --> 00:09:23.943 position:30% line:89% align:start
not officially.

00:09:28.348 --> 00:09:32.718 position:19% line:83% align:start
Ronja, I'm asking from
the bottom of my heart,

00:09:32.751 --> 00:09:34.787 position:16% line:89% align:start
please come home with me.

00:09:46.397 --> 00:09:48.665 position:38% line:89% align:start
(groans)

00:09:50.834 --> 00:09:54.071 position:16% line:89% align:start
Birk Borkason, come here!

00:09:55.639 --> 00:09:58.108 position:5% line:89% align:start
You and I are gonna have a word.

00:10:07.817 --> 00:10:11.786 position:27% line:83% align:start
- What could you
possibly want with me?

00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:15.623 position:21% line:83% align:start
- What I really want
is to punish you again.

00:10:18.159 --> 00:10:20.361 position:10% line:89% align:start
But I'm not going to do that.

00:10:23.064 --> 00:10:26.133 position:27% line:83% align:start
Instead, with all
my heart I ask you,

00:10:27.868 --> 00:10:31.405 position:30% line:83% align:start
come back to my
fort with us now.

00:10:31.438 --> 00:10:32.206 position:35% line:89% align:start
I mean it.

00:10:33.706 --> 00:10:35.875 position:5% line:89% align:start
And it's not because I like you.

00:10:35.908 --> 00:10:38.978 position:27% line:83% align:start
Don't think that,
whatever you do.

00:10:39.011 --> 00:10:41.747 position:13% line:89% align:start
But my daughter likes you.

00:10:41.781 --> 00:10:44.117 position:24% line:89% align:start
I realize that now.

00:10:44.150 --> 00:10:47.119 position:21% line:83% align:start
And perhaps, one day
in the distant future,

00:10:47.152 --> 00:10:50.088 position:24% line:83% align:start
maybe I could learn
to like you too.

00:10:52.757 --> 00:10:56.927 position:13% line:83% align:start
I've had some time to think
about things recently.

00:11:07.704 --> 00:11:08.738 position:38% line:89% align:start
- Mattis.

00:11:11.207 --> 00:11:12.742 position:33% line:89% align:start
Please wait.

00:11:12.775 --> 00:11:17.013 position:19% line:83% align:start
Birk and I must discuss
some things by ourselves.

00:11:17.046 --> 00:11:18.881 position:27% line:89% align:start
- And why's that?

00:11:18.914 --> 00:11:19.349 position:47% line:89% align:start
Ah.

00:11:20.416 --> 00:11:23.185 position:24% line:83% align:start
On second thought,
while I'm here,

00:11:23.218 --> 00:11:25.387 position:27% line:83% align:start
I'll take a look
at the bear's cave.

00:11:25.420 --> 00:11:27.688 position:10% line:89% align:start
Haven't been there in years.

00:11:28.923 --> 00:11:31.125 position:16% line:89% align:start
But don't take too long.

00:11:31.159 --> 00:11:32.360 position:27% line:89% align:start
We're going home.

00:11:33.461 --> 00:11:37.797 position:24% line:83% align:start
You're coming home,
Ronja! (laughs)

00:11:40.334 --> 00:11:43.270 position:24% line:89% align:start
(Mattis whistling)

00:11:50.809 --> 00:11:53.145 position:10% line:89% align:start
- You're coming home, Ronja.

00:11:56.148 --> 00:11:58.484 position:21% line:89% align:start
Where's home for me?

00:11:58.517 --> 00:12:01.719 position:16% line:83% align:start
They only want me around
to be their whipping boy.

00:12:01.753 --> 00:12:03.955 position:13% line:89% align:start
But I'll never be that, ha!

00:12:06.424 --> 00:12:09.194 position:33% line:83% align:start
I'll never be
their whipping boy!

00:12:10.261 --> 00:12:11.962 position:21% line:89% align:start
- Their whipping boy?

00:12:11.995 --> 00:12:14.031 position:21% line:89% align:start
How foolish are you?

00:12:14.064 --> 00:12:16.333 position:5% line:89% align:start
Would you rather freeze to death

00:12:16.366 --> 00:12:19.369 position:7% line:89% align:start
by yourself in the bear's cave?

00:12:19.403 --> 00:12:22.239 position:30% line:89% align:start
- Yes! I would.

00:12:22.272 --> 00:12:23.773 position:24% line:89% align:start
- No you wouldn't.

00:12:23.806 --> 00:12:25.975 position:19% line:83% align:start
Our lives are precious,
Birk Borkason.

00:12:26.008 --> 00:12:27.176 position:21% line:89% align:start
Don't you understand?

00:12:28.844 --> 00:12:31.880 position:7% line:83% align:start
If you really are stupid enough
to stay in the bear's cave

00:12:31.913 --> 00:12:33.449 position:19% line:89% align:start
for the entire winter,

00:12:33.482 --> 00:12:34.883 position:24% line:83% align:start
you'll be throwing
away your life

00:12:34.916 --> 00:12:36.785 position:19% line:89% align:start
and throwing away mine!

00:12:38.253 --> 00:12:40.889 position:19% line:89% align:start
- Why do you say that?

00:12:40.922 --> 00:12:42.756 position:30% line:89% align:start
Please tell me.

00:12:42.790 --> 00:12:45.826 position:19% line:83% align:start
Why would I be throwing
away your life?

00:12:45.859 --> 00:12:46.428 position:35% line:89% align:start
- Because!

00:12:48.095 --> 00:12:50.297 position:7% line:89% align:start
If you stay in the bear's cave,

00:12:50.331 --> 00:12:52.499 position:13% line:89% align:start
I will stay there with you.

00:12:53.933 --> 00:12:55.101 position:41% line:89% align:start
I will!

00:12:56.002 --> 00:12:58.271 position:13% line:89% align:start
Whether you like it or not!

00:13:08.814 --> 00:13:10.115 position:38% line:89% align:start
- Ronja.

00:13:10.148 --> 00:13:12.918 position:24% line:83% align:start
Do you know what it
is you're saying?

00:13:12.951 --> 00:13:13.918 position:41% line:89% align:start
Do you?

00:13:15.420 --> 00:13:17.188 position:35% line:89% align:start
- Yes I do.

00:13:17.221 --> 00:13:19.323 position:24% line:83% align:start
I know that nothing
can keep us apart.

00:13:19.357 --> 00:13:21.425 position:30% line:83% align:start
And you should
know that as well.

00:13:21.459 --> 00:13:24.061 position:5% line:89% align:start
Birk, we are brother and sister!

00:13:25.529 --> 00:13:27.063 position:27% line:89% align:start
Okay, numbskull?

00:13:34.938 --> 00:13:40.175 position:19% line:83% align:start
- I don't want to throw
your life away, sister mine.

00:13:40.209 --> 00:13:44.046 position:30% line:83% align:start
That's the last
thing I'd want to do.

00:13:44.079 --> 00:13:47.516 position:27% line:83% align:start
I'll go anywhere,
wherever you want to go.

00:13:50.251 --> 00:13:53.254 position:10% line:83% align:start
Yes, even if I end up living
under Mattis' robbers

00:13:53.288 --> 00:13:54.555 position:24% line:89% align:start
until it kills me,

00:13:54.589 --> 00:13:58.293 position:24% line:83% align:start
and I have to haunt
the castle as a spirit.

00:14:03.563 --> 00:14:04.531 position:44% line:89% align:start
Woah!

00:14:05.932 --> 00:14:08.568 position:19% line:89% align:start
- Birk, never leave me.

00:14:08.602 --> 00:14:10.136 position:24% line:89% align:start
We need each other.

00:14:11.037 --> 00:14:14.140 position:21% line:89% align:start
(calm ambient music)

00:14:28.653 --> 00:14:31.822 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Mattis humming)

00:14:44.668 --> 00:14:46.936 position:10% line:89% align:start
Let's move back, next spring.

00:14:46.969 --> 00:14:50.106 position:7% line:89% align:start
And we can live here once more!

00:14:50.139 --> 00:14:51.607 position:30% line:89% align:start
- Yes, we will.

00:14:51.641 --> 00:14:55.545 position:16% line:83% align:start
Because we'll definitely
be alive come next spring.

00:14:55.578 --> 00:14:57.946 position:35% line:89% align:start
(giggling)

00:15:22.968 --> 00:15:25.605 position:27% line:89% align:start
(horses neighing)

00:15:29.475 --> 00:15:31.477 position:30% line:89% align:start
(horse grunts)

00:15:31.510 --> 00:15:33.645 position:21% line:89% align:start
We'll be coming back!

00:15:33.679 --> 00:15:36.080 position:16% line:89% align:start
Just stay alive and well.

00:15:36.114 --> 00:15:39.884 position:30% line:83% align:start
(horse neighs)
- You'd better!

00:15:40.985 --> 00:15:44.422 position:16% line:89% align:start
(cheerful ambient music)

00:15:56.166 --> 00:15:56.999 position:38% line:89% align:start
- Mattis?

00:15:58.402 --> 00:16:01.705 position:21% line:83% align:start
I want to go home to
Borka's Keep first.

00:16:01.738 --> 00:16:05.974 position:13% line:83% align:start
To see how things are with
Undis, Borka, and the rest.

00:16:08.009 --> 00:16:10.513 position:13% line:89% align:start
But, I give you my thanks,

00:16:10.546 --> 00:16:14.282 position:24% line:83% align:start
for allowing me to
come and see Ronja

00:16:14.315 --> 00:16:16.484 position:13% line:89% align:start
whenever I choose to do so.

00:16:19.019 --> 00:16:21.589 position:7% line:89% align:start
- Well it won't be easy for me.

00:16:22.757 --> 00:16:27.026 position:27% line:83% align:start
But I'll get used
to it. (laughs)

00:16:29.496 --> 00:16:34.000 position:19% line:83% align:start
Y'know what Noddle-Pete
is always saying to me?

00:16:34.033 --> 00:16:36.068 position:30% line:89% align:start
That old fool.

00:16:36.102 --> 00:16:38.704 position:21% line:83% align:start
He thinks that before
we're all caught and hung

00:16:38.738 --> 00:16:41.039 position:30% line:89% align:start
by the sheriff,

00:16:41.072 --> 00:16:45.143 position:10% line:83% align:start
it would be best for Mattis'
robbers and Borka's robbers

00:16:45.177 --> 00:16:48.580 position:16% line:89% align:start
to join forces! (laughs)

00:16:48.613 --> 00:16:49.581 position:35% line:89% align:start
Oh dear me.

00:16:49.614 --> 00:16:53.718 position:19% line:83% align:start
He has plenty of crazy
ideas, that old idiot.

00:16:56.654 --> 00:17:01.425 position:13% line:83% align:start
It's a terrible shame that
your father is such a devil.

00:17:01.459 --> 00:17:04.093 position:24% line:83% align:start
Otherwise one might
at least be able

00:17:04.127 --> 00:17:06.095 position:10% line:89% align:start
to consider the possibility.

00:17:07.297 --> 00:17:11.468 position:19% line:83% align:start
But seeing as how he's
such a dirty devil.

00:17:11.501 --> 00:17:15.170 position:21% line:83% align:start
- Though you might be
a dirty devil yourself.

00:17:19.708 --> 00:17:21.143 position:35% line:89% align:start
- Might be.

00:17:21.176 --> 00:17:22.076 position:38% line:89% align:start
Let's go!

00:17:22.109 --> 00:17:22.744 position:41% line:89% align:start
- Yes.

00:17:24.045 --> 00:17:26.514 position:24% line:83% align:start
- Sister mine, I'll
see you tomorrow.

00:17:26.547 --> 00:17:28.282 position:19% line:89% align:start
And the day after that.

00:17:28.316 --> 00:17:29.484 position:19% line:89% align:start
And the day after that!

00:17:29.517 --> 00:17:30.284 position:35% line:89% align:start
Every day.

00:17:32.620 --> 00:17:36.389 position:5% line:89% align:start
- Yes, every day, Birk Borkason.

00:18:11.522 --> 00:18:14.458 position:38% line:89% align:start
I'm home!

00:18:24.367 --> 00:18:26.034 position:33% line:89% align:start
Noddle-Pete!

00:18:29.237 --> 00:18:32.107 position:41% line:89% align:start
(farts)

00:18:32.140 --> 00:18:34.543 position:5% line:89% align:start
- My way of saying welcome home.

00:18:36.110 --> 00:18:38.178 position:35% line:89% align:start
(laughing)

00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:03.135 position:10% line:89% align:start
It is quite funny, isn't it?

00:19:11.810 --> 00:19:13.045 position:33% line:89% align:start
- Oh, Lovis.

00:19:13.077 --> 00:19:19.182 position:10% line:83% align:start
Anytime you want me to have a
bath, I'm willing to take one.

00:19:19.216 --> 00:19:24.120 position:13% line:83% align:start
- It's long been ready, and
the water has been heated.

00:19:24.154 --> 00:19:25.455 position:13% line:89% align:start
- I knew you would do that.

00:19:25.488 --> 00:19:29.759 position:24% line:83% align:start
You always think of
everything, don't you Lovis?

00:19:29.793 --> 00:19:35.130 position:19% line:83% align:start
And I bet you've never
ever seen a filthier child!

00:19:35.164 --> 00:19:37.866 position:16% line:89% align:start
- No, I can't say I have.

00:19:37.900 --> 00:19:40.769 position:19% line:89% align:start
(laughing and sobbing)

00:19:40.803 --> 00:19:43.672 position:16% line:89% align:start
- I, I, I, I'm so, happy!

00:19:44.840 --> 00:19:47.675 position:27% line:83% align:start
- Oh stop crying!
Have some dignity, man.

00:19:47.709 --> 00:19:48.876 position:33% line:89% align:start
- Keep quiet!

00:19:48.910 --> 00:19:50.678 position:30% line:89% align:start
You could talk.

00:19:50.712 --> 00:19:52.814 position:13% line:89% align:start
We've seen you crying too.

00:19:54.381 --> 00:19:55.883 position:21% line:89% align:start
- That wasn't crying.

00:19:55.917 --> 00:19:58.185 position:10% line:89% align:start
I was just wiping away sweat.

00:19:58.218 --> 00:19:59.319 position:33% line:83% align:start
- [Tjorm] Oh
so you have sweat

00:19:59.353 --> 00:20:01.388 position:5% line:89% align:start
coming out of your eyes, do you?

00:20:01.421 --> 00:20:04.491 position:27% line:83% align:start
- What'd you say?
- Do you want to fight?

00:20:04.524 --> 00:20:06.693 position:35% line:89% align:start
(laughing)

00:20:21.873 --> 00:20:22.707 position:41% line:89% align:start
- Birk!

00:20:31.715 --> 00:20:34.752 position:38% line:89% align:start
(sobbing)

00:20:34.785 --> 00:20:37.487 position:30% line:83% align:start
Birk my son, at
last you're home!

00:20:50.399 --> 00:20:53.235 position:27% line:89% align:start
- Birk! (sobbing)

00:20:56.538 --> 00:20:59.808 position:19% line:89% align:start
(upbeat ambient music)

00:21:20.359 --> 00:21:21.627 position:30% line:89% align:start
- [All] Cheers!

00:21:30.669 --> 00:21:32.905 position:35% line:89% align:start
(laughing)

00:22:11.406 --> 00:22:13.407 position:41% line:89% align:start
(sighs)

00:22:32.425 --> 00:22:33.826 position:27% line:89% align:start
- [Mattis] Ronja.

00:22:35.061 --> 00:22:36.294 position:41% line:89% align:start
Ronja!

00:22:37.395 --> 00:22:39.031 position:30% line:89% align:start
- What's wrong?

00:22:39.065 --> 00:22:40.499 position:24% line:89% align:start
- [Mattis] Nothing.

00:22:40.532 --> 00:22:44.368 position:21% line:83% align:start
I just wanted to make
sure you were still here.

00:22:47.338 --> 00:22:49.673 position:24% line:89% align:start
- Yes, course I am.

00:22:49.707 --> 00:22:50.641 position:35% line:89% align:start
Still here!

00:22:51.709 --> 00:22:53.043 position:27% line:89% align:start
- [Mattis] Good.

00:22:55.378 --> 00:22:59.349 position:7% line:83% align:start
- [Narrator] And so everything
was as it used to be.

00:23:01.018 --> 00:23:03.853 position:24% line:83% align:start
Then Ronja wondered
how Birk was getting on

00:23:03.887 --> 00:23:04.954 position:21% line:89% align:start
over at Borka's Keep.

00:23:06.523 --> 00:23:10.759 position:13% line:83% align:start
I hope he's warm right down
to his toes, she thought.

00:23:12.494 --> 00:23:14.329 position:19% line:89% align:start
I'll ask him tomorrow.

00:23:21.069 --> 00:23:22.603 position:27% line:89% align:start
(exciting music)

00:23:22.637 --> 00:23:26.007 position:24% line:83% align:start
Next time on Ronja,
the Robber's Daughter.

00:23:30.044 --> 00:23:32.345 position:13% line:89% align:start
"Fight of the Wild Beasts".

00:23:34.047 --> 00:23:35.415 position:30% line:89% align:start
Don't miss it!

00:23:36.416 --> 00:23:39.085 position:21% line:89% align:start
(calm ambient music)
