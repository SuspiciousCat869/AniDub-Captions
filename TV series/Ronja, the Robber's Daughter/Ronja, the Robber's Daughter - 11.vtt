- [Birk] Come on, it's time
to get you out of here.

00:01:42.634 --> 00:01:45.267 position:16% line:83% align:start
- [Narrator] Ronja almost
froze to death whilst stuck

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:46.567 position:33% line:89% align:start
in the snow.

00:01:46.601 --> 00:01:49.567 position:27% line:83% align:start
She was lucky to
be rescued by Birk.

00:01:49.601 --> 00:01:54.167 position:10% line:83% align:start
Together, they made a promise
to become brother and sister.

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.534 position:30% line:83% align:start
But the morning
after her ordeal,

00:01:56.567 --> 00:01:58.501 position:16% line:89% align:start
she could barely get up.

00:02:00.467 --> 00:02:03.701 position:5% line:89% align:start
Never before had Ronja been ill.

00:02:03.734 --> 00:02:07.300 position:16% line:89% align:start
(soft violins and flute)

00:02:17.567 --> 00:02:20.567 position:21% line:89% align:start
(fireplace crackling)

00:02:31.567 --> 00:02:33.734 position:38% line:89% align:start
(exhales)

00:02:34.601 --> 00:02:37.467 position:30% line:89% align:start
(moans softly)

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.767 position:13% line:89% align:start
- Ronja, you're never ill.

00:02:44.801 --> 00:02:46.734 position:41% line:89% align:start
(sighs)

00:02:48.467 --> 00:02:50.501 position:10% line:89% align:start
What's wrong with you, Ronja?

00:02:50.534 --> 00:02:51.400 position:35% line:89% align:start
Talk to me!

00:02:53.601 --> 00:02:54.467 position:41% line:89% align:start
(gasps)

00:02:54.501 --> 00:02:55.634 position:27% line:89% align:start
She's burning up.

00:02:55.667 --> 00:02:57.334 position:13% line:89% align:start
Tell me, what should I do?

00:02:57.367 --> 00:02:59.467 position:38% line:89% align:start
(weeping)

00:03:04.667 --> 00:03:06.601 position:35% line:89% align:start
(chuckles)

00:03:06.634 --> 00:03:10.734 position:27% line:83% align:start
(screams loudly)
(crowd gasp)

00:03:14.467 --> 00:03:18.767 position:13% line:83% align:start
From the very first moment
I held her in my arms,

00:03:18.801 --> 00:03:21.300 position:24% line:83% align:start
I knew that one day
this would happen.

00:03:21.334 --> 00:03:22.801 position:33% line:89% align:start
(crowd gasps)

00:03:22.834 --> 00:03:24.601 position:19% line:89% align:start
My daughter, my child,

00:03:27.501 --> 00:03:29.267 position:24% line:89% align:start
she's going to die.

00:03:30.734 --> 00:03:31.567 position:38% line:89% align:start
Not now!

00:03:33.534 --> 00:03:36.501 position:27% line:89% align:start
(screams loudly)

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:45.200 position:13% line:89% align:start
- [Noddle Pete] Here we go.

00:03:45.234 --> 00:03:47.400 position:27% line:89% align:start
(screams loudly)

00:03:47.434 --> 00:03:50.133 position:27% line:89% align:start
(crowd shouting)

00:03:54.133 --> 00:03:55.400 position:24% line:89% align:start
- Stop it, Mattis!

00:03:58.334 --> 00:04:02.567 position:24% line:83% align:start
- Calm down, you're
going to frighten Ronja!

00:04:02.601 --> 00:04:04.234 position:41% line:89% align:start
- Huh?

00:04:04.267 --> 00:04:05.033 position:44% line:89% align:start
- Eh?

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:14.133 position:16% line:89% align:start
(upbeat acoustic guitar)

00:04:14.167 --> 00:04:17.033 position:33% line:89% align:start
(flute music)

00:04:17.067 --> 00:04:19.567 position:13% line:83% align:start
- When you're not very well
it's important to keep warm

00:04:19.601 --> 00:04:21.033 position:30% line:89% align:start
and take care.

00:04:21.067 --> 00:04:24.267 position:21% line:83% align:start
And you are very ill,
my little flower.

00:04:25.467 --> 00:04:28.634 position:21% line:83% align:start
- No, I'm not, don't
be silly, Mattis.

00:04:30.167 --> 00:04:32.467 position:7% line:89% align:start
It's nothing, I'll get better.

00:04:34.267 --> 00:04:35.100 position:35% line:89% align:start
After all,

00:04:36.801 --> 00:04:40.000 position:24% line:83% align:start
it could have been
much, much worse.

00:04:41.801 --> 00:04:44.367 position:30% line:89% align:start
(pants heavily)

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:45.167 position:38% line:89% align:start
- Ronja!

00:04:46.367 --> 00:04:48.467 position:41% line:89% align:start
(sobs)

00:04:49.634 --> 00:04:53.033 position:21% line:89% align:start
(acoustic band music)

00:04:53.734 --> 00:04:56.267 position:41% line:89% align:start
(gasps)

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:58.367 position:16% line:89% align:start
My Ronja, my little dove.

00:04:59.534 --> 00:05:01.701 position:21% line:83% align:start
She weeps because she
is to part from us

00:05:01.734 --> 00:05:04.133 position:13% line:89% align:start
at such a tender young age!

00:05:07.367 --> 00:05:09.100 position:21% line:89% align:start
Don't cry, good girl.

00:05:10.501 --> 00:05:12.701 position:27% line:83% align:start
Just try to think
about tomorrow.

00:05:12.734 --> 00:05:15.367 position:33% line:89% align:start
(crowd weeps)

00:05:18.667 --> 00:05:23.467 position:19% line:83% align:start
- Nobody cries for me,
and I get far more ill.

00:05:23.501 --> 00:05:26.434 position:24% line:89% align:start
(jovial band music)

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:28.334 position:38% line:89% align:start
- Lovis!

00:05:29.667 --> 00:05:30.501 position:41% line:89% align:start
Lovis!

00:05:32.801 --> 00:05:35.467 position:30% line:89% align:start
(heavy panting)

00:05:40.167 --> 00:05:41.000 position:41% line:89% align:start
Lovis!

00:05:44.701 --> 00:05:47.367 position:30% line:89% align:start
(sheep whining)

00:05:55.434 --> 00:05:58.634 position:27% line:89% align:start
(grunts and sobs)

00:05:58.667 --> 00:06:02.767 position:10% line:83% align:start
With our beautiful daughter's
life hanging by a thread,

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:09.667 position:19% line:83% align:start
it's Lovis's duty as a
mother to be with her!

00:06:09.701 --> 00:06:12.367 position:30% line:89% align:start
(whines loudly)

00:06:21.634 --> 00:06:24.300 position:30% line:89% align:start
(sheep whining)

00:06:26.434 --> 00:06:28.734 position:24% line:83% align:start
Why aren't you with
your sick daughter?

00:06:28.767 --> 00:06:30.367 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:32.667 position:19% line:89% align:start
- My daughter is sick?

00:06:32.701 --> 00:06:35.267 position:19% line:89% align:start
First I've heard of it.

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:38.300 position:7% line:89% align:start
As soon as I've fed the sheep.

00:06:38.334 --> 00:06:40.300 position:19% line:89% align:start
- I'll feed the sheep!

00:06:41.167 --> 00:06:42.200 position:30% line:89% align:start
You go to her!

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:47.501 position:21% line:83% align:start
If it's not too late
and she's still alive!

00:06:47.534 --> 00:06:49.400 position:41% line:89% align:start
(sobs)

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:52.033 position:41% line:89% align:start
- Hmm.

00:06:53.334 --> 00:06:54.701 position:33% line:89% align:start
(door creaks)

00:06:54.734 --> 00:06:57.701 position:27% line:83% align:start
- Ronja, don't go
dying on me yet,

00:06:59.334 --> 00:07:02.734 position:13% line:83% align:start
not before you've seen your
mother's face one last time.

00:07:02.767 --> 00:07:06.200 position:27% line:89% align:start
(sheep bleating)

00:07:06.234 --> 00:07:08.634 position:30% line:89% align:start
(fire crackles)

00:07:15.834 --> 00:07:18.334 position:33% line:89% align:start
(Ronja moans)

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:22.367 position:30% line:89% align:start
(gasps softly)

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:23.133 position:41% line:89% align:start
- Hmm?

00:07:24.234 --> 00:07:26.467 position:35% line:89% align:start
(soft moan)

00:07:26.501 --> 00:07:29.033 position:33% line:89% align:start
(soft music)

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:36.467 position:16% line:83% align:start
- [Narrator] Ronja spent
three whole days in bed.

00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:42.400 position:10% line:89% align:start
Three whole days and nights.

00:07:42.434 --> 00:07:46.534 position:10% line:83% align:start
It gave her plenty of time to
think, and not surprisingly,

00:07:46.567 --> 00:07:50.100 position:19% line:83% align:start
she became a much more
thoughtful person.

00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:56.167 position:30% line:89% align:start
(moans softly)

00:07:58.267 --> 00:08:01.567 position:21% line:89% align:start
- Birk, brother mine.

00:08:02.334 --> 00:08:03.200 position:27% line:89% align:start
- [Mattis] Ronja!

00:08:03.234 --> 00:08:05.367 position:41% line:89% align:start
(gasps)

00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:08.033 position:30% line:83% align:start
My little dove,
here's some porridge.

00:08:12.100 --> 00:08:15.200 position:21% line:83% align:start
- Oh, I've never lied
to Mattis before,

00:08:15.234 --> 00:08:17.434 position:19% line:83% align:start
but I could never tell
him that Borka's son

00:08:17.467 --> 00:08:19.234 position:19% line:89% align:start
is my brother now, no.

00:08:20.634 --> 00:08:25.267 position:21% line:83% align:start
If I ever I told him
that, it would be like,

00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:28.801 position:21% line:83% align:start
hitting him over the
head with a sledgehammer,

00:08:28.834 --> 00:08:30.267 position:27% line:89% align:start
only much worse.

00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:34.000 position:33% line:89% align:start
(soft music)

00:08:52.334 --> 00:08:54.334 position:41% line:89% align:start
(gasps)

00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:11.634 position:19% line:89% align:start
I must keep it secret.

00:09:11.667 --> 00:09:15.634 position:7% line:83% align:start
Otherwise Mattis would be even
more heartbroken and upset.

00:09:15.667 --> 00:09:17.601 position:16% line:89% align:start
He'd tear the fort down.

00:09:20.634 --> 00:09:23.300 position:30% line:89% align:start
(soft keyboard)

00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:30.767 position:24% line:83% align:start
But why does Mattis
have to be like that?

00:09:30.801 --> 00:09:32.100 position:30% line:89% align:start
He's so angry.

00:09:33.567 --> 00:09:36.300 position:27% line:83% align:start
No matter whether
he's happy or sad,

00:09:36.334 --> 00:09:38.534 position:21% line:89% align:start
it's always the same.

00:09:38.567 --> 00:09:39.467 position:24% line:89% align:start
He's full of rage.

00:09:40.767 --> 00:09:45.467 position:19% line:83% align:start
And so much fury, it's
enough for our whole clan!

00:09:45.501 --> 00:09:47.601 position:38% line:89% align:start
(snoring)

00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:59.167 position:30% line:89% align:start
(mouth smacks)

00:10:00.567 --> 00:10:02.734 position:38% line:89% align:start
(snoring)

00:10:06.133 --> 00:10:09.133 position:24% line:89% align:start
(soft serene music)

00:10:19.834 --> 00:10:22.100 position:24% line:89% align:start
I want to see Birk.

00:10:22.133 --> 00:10:25.501 position:27% line:83% align:start
I want to be with
my new brother.

00:10:25.534 --> 00:10:29.367 position:19% line:83% align:start
Even if it means I have
to steal away to do it.

00:10:33.167 --> 00:10:36.167 position:24% line:89% align:start
(soft serene music)

00:10:37.467 --> 00:10:40.067 position:30% line:89% align:start
(wind blowing)

00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:44.701 position:38% line:89% align:start
- Ronja!

00:10:46.534 --> 00:10:47.634 position:33% line:89% align:start
You're alive!

00:10:49.334 --> 00:10:53.467 position:13% line:83% align:start
Seeing you this well again,
I couldn't be happier.

00:10:56.601 --> 00:10:59.767 position:24% line:83% align:start
Ronja, are you sure
you're all right?

00:10:59.801 --> 00:11:02.634 position:10% line:89% align:start
- Oh, nothing wrong with me.

00:11:02.667 --> 00:11:04.167 position:27% line:89% align:start
I feel very well.

00:11:06.167 --> 00:11:07.200 position:38% line:89% align:start
- Great!

00:11:07.234 --> 00:11:11.067 position:21% line:89% align:start
(laughs hysterically)

00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:14.033 position:24% line:89% align:start
(loud wind blowing)

00:11:22.534 --> 00:11:24.701 position:21% line:83% align:start
- With all this snow
covering everything,

00:11:24.734 --> 00:11:27.567 position:30% line:83% align:start
I'll never get
away to the forest.

00:11:34.067 --> 00:11:37.200 position:19% line:83% align:start
And I've had just about
enough of them for a while.

00:11:37.234 --> 00:11:38.567 position:41% line:89% align:start
(sighs)

00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:44.667 position:10% line:83% align:start
So this is how it feels when
I'm not able to see him.

00:11:44.701 --> 00:11:49.000 position:19% line:83% align:start
It's as if there were a
thousand miles between us.

00:11:51.334 --> 00:11:52.734 position:27% line:89% align:start
Because of snow!

00:11:52.767 --> 00:11:55.667 position:27% line:89% align:start
(angry grunting)

00:11:55.701 --> 00:11:58.467 position:27% line:89% align:start
(whimsical music)

00:12:05.067 --> 00:12:07.434 position:30% line:89% align:start
(men grunting)

00:12:14.100 --> 00:12:18.334 position:19% line:83% align:start
- Sturkas and I fetched
the water yesterday!

00:12:18.367 --> 00:12:22.100 position:24% line:83% align:start
- Which means it's
someone else's turn

00:12:22.133 --> 00:12:23.367 position:41% line:89% align:start
today!

00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:24.167 position:44% line:89% align:start
- Ow!

00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:28.801 position:30% line:89% align:start
- No, it's not!

00:12:28.834 --> 00:12:32.501 position:21% line:83% align:start
I think you suggested
drawing straws for it anyway,

00:12:32.534 --> 00:12:33.634 position:33% line:89% align:start
and you lost!

00:12:38.634 --> 00:12:42.501 position:10% line:83% align:start
That was the point of drawing
straws in the first place!

00:12:42.534 --> 00:12:45.133 position:21% line:83% align:start
- We've been the last
two days in a row

00:12:45.167 --> 00:12:47.701 position:10% line:89% align:start
and it's not our turn again!

00:12:47.734 --> 00:12:51.400 position:16% line:83% align:start
Lill-Klippen, aren't you
forgetting a little something

00:12:51.434 --> 00:12:53.200 position:19% line:89% align:start
called human kindness?

00:12:54.167 --> 00:12:57.100 position:10% line:89% align:start
- I'm against drawing straws!

00:12:57.133 --> 00:12:59.767 position:13% line:83% align:start
Any of you gone to collect
the water twenty times

00:12:59.801 --> 00:13:01.734 position:27% line:89% align:start
this winter, huh?

00:13:04.434 --> 00:13:05.801 position:35% line:89% align:start
Thought so!

00:13:05.834 --> 00:13:09.667 position:27% line:83% align:start
If I go any more,
I'll freeze to death!

00:13:09.701 --> 00:13:10.767 position:33% line:89% align:start
- Who cares?!

00:13:10.801 --> 00:13:15.167 position:21% line:83% align:start
If you draw the short
straw, then it's your turn!

00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:21.133 position:24% line:83% align:start
- Okay then, let's
settle this with a fight!

00:13:21.167 --> 00:13:23.200 position:21% line:89% align:start
- You're in trouble.

00:13:23.234 --> 00:13:24.167 position:33% line:89% align:start
- I'm ready!

00:13:25.534 --> 00:13:29.067 position:19% line:89% align:start
(grunting and shouting)

00:13:31.167 --> 00:13:33.367 position:13% line:83% align:start
- Breakfast is barely over,
already you're behaving

00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:35.167 position:19% line:89% align:start
like naughty children!

00:13:37.734 --> 00:13:41.100 position:21% line:83% align:start
You're all as idle as
a herd of fat oxen.

00:13:41.133 --> 00:13:43.100 position:13% line:83% align:start
If you're not out robbing,
you better make yourselves

00:13:43.133 --> 00:13:44.467 position:24% line:89% align:start
useful around here!

00:13:45.467 --> 00:13:47.367 position:38% line:89% align:start
(moaning)

00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:49.234 position:27% line:89% align:start
Fjosok, Sturkas!

00:13:49.267 --> 00:13:51.801 position:16% line:83% align:start
If you won't fetch water,
you can shovel snow.

00:13:51.834 --> 00:13:53.534 position:27% line:89% align:start
(gasping for air)

00:13:53.567 --> 00:13:57.801 position:7% line:83% align:start
Start by clearing every single
roof and pathway in the fort.

00:13:57.834 --> 00:14:02.434 position:13% line:83% align:start
Klippen and Tjorm, you take
the hay into the stables.

00:14:02.467 --> 00:14:06.767 position:24% line:83% align:start
Knotas, bring some
firewood to the kitchen.

00:14:06.801 --> 00:14:08.801 position:33% line:83% align:start
Pelje, go and
check on the goats.

00:14:08.834 --> 00:14:12.234 position:27% line:83% align:start
See if the small
one is eating again.

00:14:12.267 --> 00:14:13.033 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmm.

00:14:14.601 --> 00:14:15.434 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh.

00:14:21.701 --> 00:14:24.767 position:24% line:89% align:start
(strong wind blows)

00:14:24.801 --> 00:14:27.501 position:27% line:89% align:start
(loud shoveling)

00:14:30.334 --> 00:14:33.133 position:21% line:83% align:start
- [Sturkas] I'm never
drawing straws again!

00:14:33.167 --> 00:14:36.033 position:27% line:89% align:start
(fire crackling)

00:14:46.467 --> 00:14:49.434 position:7% line:89% align:start
- Ronja, it's your turn again.

00:14:49.467 --> 00:14:50.234 position:41% line:89% align:start
- Huh?

00:14:57.133 --> 00:14:58.601 position:41% line:89% align:start
- Hmm.

00:14:58.634 --> 00:15:00.767 position:38% line:89% align:start
(mumbles)

00:15:00.801 --> 00:15:03.467 position:16% line:89% align:start
Looks like I lose again.

00:15:03.501 --> 00:15:05.701 position:10% line:83% align:start
And it appears that you have
a real talent for gambling,

00:15:05.734 --> 00:15:07.334 position:35% line:89% align:start
young lady!

00:15:07.367 --> 00:15:08.701 position:35% line:89% align:start
(chuckles)

00:15:08.734 --> 00:15:09.501 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hey?

00:15:11.501 --> 00:15:15.701 position:13% line:83% align:start
I know, how about we play a
little Murktrolls' Nose next?

00:15:18.534 --> 00:15:20.634 position:35% line:89% align:start
(chuckles)

00:15:20.667 --> 00:15:22.601 position:41% line:89% align:start
(sighs)

00:15:25.734 --> 00:15:28.434 position:13% line:83% align:start
But first, perhaps I should
go and relieve myself.

00:15:28.467 --> 00:15:32.634 position:10% line:83% align:start
Being old means I have to go
as often as a Harpy shrieks.

00:15:32.667 --> 00:15:34.200 position:16% line:89% align:start
Did I say that out loud?

00:15:34.234 --> 00:15:35.701 position:13% line:89% align:start
No, hang on, I've gotta go.

00:15:35.734 --> 00:15:38.467 position:7% line:89% align:start
Oh, I've really gotta go, oooh!

00:15:48.567 --> 00:15:52.434 position:19% line:83% align:start
- There's only so much
dice you can play.

00:15:52.467 --> 00:15:55.133 position:27% line:89% align:start
(soft footsteps)

00:16:12.100 --> 00:16:15.267 position:21% line:89% align:start
(strong wind blowing)

00:16:26.334 --> 00:16:30.534 position:19% line:83% align:start
If I can't go over it,
maybe I can go under.

00:16:33.067 --> 00:16:35.067 position:41% line:89% align:start
(gasps)

00:16:35.801 --> 00:16:37.501 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmm!

00:16:37.534 --> 00:16:40.467 position:24% line:89% align:start
(strong wind blows)

00:16:41.701 --> 00:16:44.667 position:27% line:89% align:start
(soft footsteps)

00:16:47.701 --> 00:16:51.634 position:7% line:89% align:start
(wind blows in the background)

00:16:58.667 --> 00:17:01.367 position:33% line:89% align:start
(door creaks)

00:17:05.367 --> 00:17:07.734 position:30% line:89% align:start
(gasps loudly)

00:17:09.267 --> 00:17:11.567 position:33% line:89% align:start
(jazzy music)

00:17:22.667 --> 00:17:28.200 position:10% line:83% align:start
- Noddle-Pete told me this is
where they kept prisoners in

00:17:28.234 --> 00:17:31.200 position:21% line:83% align:start
the olden days, down
here in the dark.

00:17:34.234 --> 00:17:36.400 position:19% line:89% align:start
Never seeing daylight.

00:17:36.434 --> 00:17:38.534 position:13% line:89% align:start
Locked up until they died.

00:17:41.667 --> 00:17:43.634 position:38% line:89% align:start
(shivers)

00:17:45.701 --> 00:17:48.367 position:33% line:89% align:start
(jazzy music)

00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:12.167 position:21% line:83% align:start
- These dungeons are
under Hell's Gap.

00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:14.734 position:24% line:83% align:start
On the stormy night
when you were born,

00:18:14.767 --> 00:18:17.501 position:30% line:83% align:start
the whole place
was split in two,

00:18:17.534 --> 00:18:22.467 position:21% line:83% align:start
with rocks and rubble
covering this whole area.

00:18:22.501 --> 00:18:26.400 position:27% line:83% align:start
And so the entire
passageway was cut in half.

00:18:26.434 --> 00:18:30.267 position:24% line:83% align:start
And this is as far
as you can safely go.

00:18:30.300 --> 00:18:32.534 position:7% line:89% align:start
- As far as you can safely go.

00:18:33.834 --> 00:18:36.534 position:33% line:89% align:start
(jazzy music)

00:18:40.467 --> 00:18:44.634 position:13% line:83% align:start
But on the other side, the
passage way, it must carry on.

00:18:47.267 --> 00:18:49.567 position:10% line:89% align:start
I will get to the other side.

00:18:51.767 --> 00:18:54.601 position:27% line:83% align:start
All this rock and
rubble can't stop me.

00:18:54.634 --> 00:18:57.567 position:27% line:83% align:start
Birk's there, and
I will get to him.

00:19:03.501 --> 00:19:06.234 position:27% line:89% align:start
(loud shoveling)

00:19:10.634 --> 00:19:11.701 position:38% line:89% align:start
- Anyone?

00:19:11.734 --> 00:19:14.067 position:13% line:89% align:start
Anyone seen Ronja recently?

00:19:14.100 --> 00:19:17.601 position:24% line:83% align:start
I wonder what she's
been doing with herself.

00:19:17.634 --> 00:19:21.667 position:10% line:83% align:start
- That child is impulsive and
comes and goes as she likes.

00:19:21.701 --> 00:19:26.000 position:10% line:83% align:start
- I bet she's shoveling snow
with the rest (chuckles).

00:19:27.501 --> 00:19:28.534 position:41% line:89% align:start
- Hmm.

00:19:32.601 --> 00:19:35.567 position:21% line:89% align:start
(inspirational music)

00:19:37.734 --> 00:19:40.200 position:35% line:89% align:start
(grunting)

00:19:47.634 --> 00:19:50.567 position:27% line:89% align:start
(whimsical horn)

00:19:54.434 --> 00:19:56.667 position:35% line:89% align:start
(grunting)

00:20:07.534 --> 00:20:10.133 position:30% line:89% align:start
(pants softly)

00:20:11.601 --> 00:20:14.367 position:30% line:89% align:start
(light flutes)

00:20:22.501 --> 00:20:26.334 position:19% line:83% align:start
- If I see Birk again,
we'll be able to talk.

00:20:27.801 --> 00:20:34.334 position:16% line:83% align:start
And then I will find out
if he really is my brother

00:20:34.367 --> 00:20:37.400 position:5% line:89% align:start
as he promised in the snowstorm,

00:20:37.434 --> 00:20:41.200 position:10% line:89% align:start
when he called me his sister.

00:20:43.400 --> 00:20:46.000 position:30% line:89% align:start
(jovial music)

00:20:49.334 --> 00:20:52.567 position:16% line:89% align:start
(breathing and grunting)

00:20:54.367 --> 00:20:58.200 position:10% line:89% align:start
(crowd laughing and chatting)

00:20:59.501 --> 00:21:02.200 position:30% line:89% align:start
(beating drums)

00:21:03.334 --> 00:21:07.167 position:10% line:89% align:start
(crowd laughing and shouting)

00:21:08.567 --> 00:21:10.400 position:30% line:89% align:start
- From now on,

00:21:10.434 --> 00:21:12.400 position:21% line:89% align:start
so long as I'm alive,

00:21:12.434 --> 00:21:18.701 position:19% line:83% align:start
never again am I going
to move any stones,

00:21:18.734 --> 00:21:21.467 position:33% line:89% align:start
big or small.

00:21:22.501 --> 00:21:25.434 position:24% line:89% align:start
(light orchestral)

00:21:29.501 --> 00:21:32.367 position:27% line:89% align:start
(stones rustling)

00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:35.267 position:27% line:89% align:start
(light grunting)

00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:46.767 position:27% line:89% align:start
(light grunting)

00:21:48.667 --> 00:21:51.133 position:35% line:89% align:start
(grunting)

00:21:57.434 --> 00:21:58.434 position:47% line:89% align:start
Ah!

00:22:00.334 --> 00:22:03.367 position:10% line:89% align:start
Come on, why won't you move!

00:22:05.167 --> 00:22:08.434 position:24% line:83% align:start
Oh Birk, it seemed
like such a good idea!

00:22:08.467 --> 00:22:11.334 position:24% line:89% align:start
(light orchestral)

00:22:15.434 --> 00:22:18.100 position:30% line:89% align:start
(rocks pouring)

00:22:23.501 --> 00:22:26.400 position:27% line:83% align:start
- [Narrator] Day
after day, bit by bit,

00:22:26.434 --> 00:22:29.400 position:24% line:83% align:start
Ronja continued to
haul the rocks away.

00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:34.334 position:35% line:89% align:start
And then...

dangerous ground.

00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:11.601 position:13% line:83% align:start
