(Robbers shouting)

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:42.423 position:24% line:83% align:start
- [Narrator] Spring
came like a shout of joy

00:01:42.456 --> 00:01:45.291 position:21% line:83% align:start
to the forest around
Mattis' Fort.

00:01:45.325 --> 00:01:48.294 position:13% line:83% align:start
The robbers rid themselves
of the smell of winter.

00:01:48.328 --> 00:01:50.763 position:27% line:83% align:start
The snow melted,
and the river roared

00:01:50.797 --> 00:01:52.731 position:16% line:89% align:start
with a wild spring song,

00:01:54.733 --> 00:01:56.400 position:21% line:89% align:start
and Ronja joined in.

00:01:57.568 --> 00:02:01.372 position:24% line:83% align:start
At long last their
splendid robbers' life

00:02:01.405 --> 00:02:03.006 position:21% line:89% align:start
was beginning again.

00:02:09.245 --> 00:02:12.013 position:27% line:89% align:start
(birds chirping)

00:02:16.384 --> 00:02:19.052 position:30% line:89% align:start
(water rushing)

00:02:27.828 --> 00:02:30.596 position:27% line:89% align:start
(birds chirping)

00:02:40.738 --> 00:02:43.306 position:30% line:89% align:start
(bees buzzing)

00:02:49.846 --> 00:02:53.348 position:21% line:83% align:start
- Yes, you can almost
feel the weight

00:02:53.382 --> 00:02:56.484 position:7% line:89% align:start
of winter rising up to the sky.

00:02:56.518 --> 00:02:59.186 position:27% line:89% align:start
(birds chirping)

00:03:00.388 --> 00:03:03.690 position:5% line:89% align:start
Soon I'll be so light I can fly!

00:03:03.724 --> 00:03:05.692 position:19% line:89% align:start
Float up and fly away!

00:03:08.695 --> 00:03:11.697 position:24% line:89% align:start
(soft upbeat music)

00:03:14.198 --> 00:03:16.200 position:41% line:89% align:start
(gasps)

00:03:20.638 --> 00:03:24.174 position:19% line:89% align:start
(lighthearted laughing)

00:03:29.779 --> 00:03:31.647 position:38% line:89% align:start
(grunts)

00:03:31.681 --> 00:03:33.114 position:24% line:89% align:start
- Go on, fly then.

00:03:34.249 --> 00:03:36.384 position:7% line:89% align:start
Fly away with all the harpies,

00:03:36.418 --> 00:03:38.653 position:16% line:89% align:start
to the ends of the earth.

00:03:38.687 --> 00:03:39.754 position:38% line:89% align:start
(laughs)

00:03:39.788 --> 00:03:41.221 position:33% line:89% align:start
- Great idea.

00:03:41.255 --> 00:03:42.756 position:24% line:89% align:start
I'll give it a try.

00:03:43.824 --> 00:03:46.659 position:27% line:89% align:start
(horse whinnying)

00:03:48.795 --> 00:03:50.897 position:38% line:89% align:start
(laughs)

00:03:54.766 --> 00:03:57.168 position:24% line:89% align:start
Yes, Birk, come on.

00:03:57.201 --> 00:03:59.537 position:10% line:89% align:start
I want to catch a wild horse.

00:04:04.741 --> 00:04:06.710 position:38% line:89% align:start
(giggles)

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:15.183 position:27% line:89% align:start
(rapid breathing)

00:04:15.216 --> 00:04:17.418 position:35% line:89% align:start
(laughing)

00:04:21.321 --> 00:04:23.490 position:38% line:89% align:start
(sighing)

00:04:25.892 --> 00:04:29.462 position:19% line:89% align:start
(thundering footsteps)

00:04:29.495 --> 00:04:31.430 position:41% line:89% align:start
(gasps)

00:04:32.498 --> 00:04:35.400 position:27% line:89% align:start
(horses neighing)

00:04:35.433 --> 00:04:39.370 position:24% line:83% align:start
- A bear or a wolf
must've scared them away.

00:04:39.403 --> 00:04:43.407 position:13% line:83% align:start
Otherwise, what else would
they be so afraid of?

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:45.441 position:19% line:89% align:start
(disagreeingly grunts)

00:04:45.475 --> 00:04:47.210 position:13% line:89% align:start
- They're not running away.

00:04:47.243 --> 00:04:48.645 position:24% line:89% align:start
Horses have to run.

00:04:48.678 --> 00:04:51.413 position:19% line:83% align:start
They're running winter
out of their bodies.

00:04:51.446 --> 00:04:54.850 position:27% line:89% align:start
(horses neighing)

00:04:54.883 --> 00:04:58.619 position:16% line:83% align:start
When they finally tire of
that, they'll need to graze,

00:04:58.653 --> 00:05:00.921 position:24% line:83% align:start
and that's when one
of them is mine.

00:05:00.955 --> 00:05:02.222 position:7% line:89% align:start
'cause I'm going to catch one,

00:05:02.255 --> 00:05:05.191 position:27% line:83% align:start
and take it back
with me to the fort.

00:05:05.225 --> 00:05:07.427 position:24% line:83% align:start
- What do you need
a horse for there?

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:10.329 position:16% line:83% align:start
Wouldn't you rather ride
one here in the woods?

00:05:10.362 --> 00:05:12.765 position:13% line:83% align:start
It would make more sense if
we were to catch one each

00:05:12.798 --> 00:05:15.233 position:13% line:89% align:start
and ride them around here.

00:05:15.266 --> 00:05:18.703 position:13% line:83% align:start
- Well then, seems Borka's
Clan do sometimes have brains

00:05:18.736 --> 00:05:20.872 position:10% line:89% align:start
in their heads after all, eh?

00:05:22.239 --> 00:05:23.874 position:24% line:89% align:start
(irritated sighing)

00:05:23.907 --> 00:05:25.809 position:38% line:89% align:start
(giggles)

00:05:25.842 --> 00:05:26.777 position:33% line:89% align:start
You're right.

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:29.679 position:24% line:83% align:start
We'll catch one and
ride it in the woods!

00:05:29.712 --> 00:05:31.914 position:38% line:89% align:start
(grunts)

00:05:31.947 --> 00:05:34.850 position:19% line:89% align:start
(horse hooves pounding)

00:05:34.884 --> 00:05:37.786 position:27% line:89% align:start
(light giggling)

00:05:53.298 --> 00:05:55.934 position:27% line:89% align:start
(grass crunching)

00:05:57.869 --> 00:06:01.472 position:21% line:83% align:start
It doesn't look like
they'll be here for a while.

00:06:01.505 --> 00:06:02.973 position:21% line:89% align:start
- Well, I don't mind.

00:06:04.574 --> 00:06:09.278 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'm just enjoying the
fact that spring has come.

00:06:09.311 --> 00:06:11.313 position:41% line:89% align:start
(yawns)

00:06:13.515 --> 00:06:14.917 position:38% line:89% align:start
(laughs)

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:15.951 position:30% line:89% align:start
- I like that!

00:06:15.984 --> 00:06:17.351 position:19% line:89% align:start
I like that about you.

00:06:17.385 --> 00:06:19.854 position:24% line:83% align:start
You're so relaxed,
Birk Borkason.

00:06:22.589 --> 00:06:24.691 position:38% line:89% align:start
(laughs)

00:06:28.729 --> 00:06:30.896 position:41% line:89% align:start
(sighs)

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:34.232 position:21% line:89% align:start
(soft relaxing music)

00:06:35.433 --> 00:06:37.802 position:30% line:89% align:start
(bird hooting)

00:07:13.665 --> 00:07:15.901 position:35% line:89% align:start
(laughing)

00:07:27.043 --> 00:07:30.013 position:27% line:89% align:start
(horses blowing)

00:07:32.815 --> 00:07:36.018 position:5% line:89% align:start
You were right about this, Birk.

00:07:36.051 --> 00:07:39.954 position:16% line:83% align:start
Why should I take a horse
away from where he belongs?

00:07:39.988 --> 00:07:42.289 position:13% line:89% align:start
But I do want to ride one.

00:07:44.992 --> 00:07:47.560 position:7% line:89% align:start
Stay there, I'm coming for you.

00:07:49.762 --> 00:07:51.464 position:27% line:89% align:start
(curiously gasps)

00:07:51.497 --> 00:07:53.498 position:27% line:89% align:start
- How about them?

00:07:53.532 --> 00:07:56.001 position:27% line:89% align:start
(birds chirping)

00:08:06.409 --> 00:08:08.745 position:19% line:89% align:start
(sighing in agreement)

00:08:08.778 --> 00:08:11.781 position:21% line:89% align:start

(birds chirping)

00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:42.156 position:10% line:89% align:start
- The first loot of the year.

00:09:42.190 --> 00:09:44.992 position:27% line:89% align:start
(wicked giggling)

00:09:45.025 --> 00:09:46.159 position:27% line:89% align:start
Let's go! Heeyaw!

00:09:48.527 --> 00:09:51.163 position:24% line:89% align:start
(hooves thundering)

00:09:51.197 --> 00:09:52.698 position:35% line:89% align:start

(grunting)

00:10:25.026 --> 00:10:26.726 position:35% line:89% align:start
- The rope!

00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:27.527 position:41% line:89% align:start
- Huh?

00:10:33.032 --> 00:10:34.767 position:44% line:89% align:start
Done!

00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:37.568 position:27% line:89% align:start
(horse whinnying)

00:10:38.536 --> 00:10:40.705 position:38% line:89% align:start

00:10:42.907 --> 00:10:45.209 position:27% line:89% align:start
(heavy breathing)

00:10:45.243 --> 00:10:47.543 position:10% line:89% align:start
I'd love for us to ride them.

00:10:47.577 --> 00:10:48.511 position:33% line:89% align:start
Maybe later.

00:10:49.879 --> 00:10:52.848 position:30% line:83% align:start
They don't seem
to be in the mood.

00:10:52.882 --> 00:10:54.884 position:35% line:89% align:start
(whinnying)

00:10:54.917 --> 00:10:56.152 position:21% line:89% align:start
- They don't know us.

00:10:56.185 --> 00:10:59.054 position:21% line:83% align:start
We need to show them
we mean no harm.

00:10:59.087 --> 00:11:00.155 position:27% line:89% align:start
- Oh, that's it!

00:11:03.158 --> 00:11:05.192 position:41% line:89% align:start

00:11:05.225 --> 00:11:07.694 position:35% line:89% align:start

00:11:11.965 --> 00:11:14.633 position:5% line:89% align:start
Here, you want something to eat?

(snorts)
(fearful gasps)

(snorting)

00:11:40.188 --> 00:11:42.156 position:19% line:89% align:start
That was a close call.

00:11:42.190 --> 00:11:43.523 position:27% line:83% align:start
There's no way I
can go back home

00:11:43.557 --> 00:11:45.525 position:7% line:89% align:start
to Mattis without any fingers.

00:11:45.559 --> 00:11:50.130 position:16% line:83% align:start
He will definitely ask me
what happened to them all.

00:11:50.163 --> 00:11:52.098 position:33% line:89% align:start
- That horse!

00:11:52.131 --> 00:11:53.666 position:7% line:89% align:start
Is quite the villain, isn't he?

00:11:53.699 --> 00:11:56.202 position:27% line:89% align:start
(horse whinnying)

00:11:56.235 --> 00:11:59.604 position:24% line:83% align:start
- Villain's a good
name, don't you think?

00:12:01.039 --> 00:12:04.942 position:13% line:83% align:start
Yes, I'm going to give that
horse the name Villain.

00:12:04.975 --> 00:12:07.810 position:38% line:89% align:start
(laughs)

00:12:07.844 --> 00:12:09.579 position:16% line:89% align:start
- You have to name mine.

00:12:09.612 --> 00:12:12.215 position:5% line:89% align:start
I named yours so it's only fair.

00:12:13.116 --> 00:12:17.285 position:33% line:83% align:start
- Let's see.
(whinnying)

00:12:17.319 --> 00:12:19.187 position:19% line:89% align:start
Yours is just as crazy.

00:12:20.588 --> 00:12:21.789 position:41% line:89% align:start
(gasps)

00:12:21.822 --> 00:12:24.225 position:21% line:83% align:start
You should definitely
call him Savage.

00:12:24.258 --> 00:12:27.228 position:27% line:89% align:start
- Sure. (laughs)

00:12:27.261 --> 00:12:29.162 position:24% line:89% align:start
Did you hear that?

00:12:29.195 --> 00:12:30.964 position:24% line:89% align:start
We just named you.

00:12:30.997 --> 00:12:34.633 position:24% line:83% align:start
Now you both belong
to us two forever.

00:12:34.666 --> 00:12:38.070 position:21% line:83% align:start
And we've called you
Villain and Savage.

00:12:38.103 --> 00:12:39.003 position:35% line:83% align:start
(whinnying)
We think the names

00:12:39.038 --> 00:12:42.240 position:13% line:89% align:start
(laughs) are quite fitting.

00:12:42.273 --> 00:12:45.243 position:24% line:83% align:start
Whether you like it
or not, that's it.

00:12:45.276 --> 00:12:46.977 position:21% line:89% align:start
You're stuck with us.

00:12:47.010 --> 00:12:49.279 position:16% line:89% align:start
And we're stuck with you.

00:12:49.312 --> 00:12:51.714 position:35% line:89% align:start
(laughing)

00:12:53.249 --> 00:12:56.118 position:21% line:89% align:start
(lighthearted music)

00:12:59.187 --> 00:13:01.923 position:27% line:89% align:start
(birds chirping)

00:13:08.362 --> 00:13:10.830 position:35% line:89% align:start
(grunting)

00:13:12.732 --> 00:13:15.901 position:16% line:83% align:start
- Food and money, and all
kinds of supplies. (laughs)

00:13:15.934 --> 00:13:18.236 position:24% line:83% align:start
This is a great way
to bring in spring.

00:13:18.270 --> 00:13:20.305 position:38% line:89% align:start
(grunts)

00:13:21.939 --> 00:13:22.573 position:41% line:89% align:start
- Hmm?

00:13:24.708 --> 00:13:27.178 position:7% line:89% align:start
(distant thundering footsteps)

00:13:27.211 --> 00:13:30.013 position:30% line:89% align:start
(angrily sighs)

00:13:32.215 --> 00:13:33.049 position:38% line:89% align:start
- Mattis!

00:13:34.217 --> 00:13:37.252 position:27% line:83% align:start
You'd better hand
over all that loot!

00:13:37.286 --> 00:13:39.254 position:35% line:89% align:start
(laughing)

00:13:39.288 --> 00:13:40.255 position:38% line:89% align:start
(grunts)

00:13:40.289 --> 00:13:43.024 position:13% line:89% align:start
- You're a bit late, Borka.

00:13:43.057 --> 00:13:47.928 position:7% line:83% align:start
And I wouldn't even share sheep
dung with any of your men.

00:13:47.961 --> 00:13:48.728 position:38% line:89% align:start
Let's go.

00:13:49.396 --> 00:13:50.230 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yaw!

00:13:52.332 --> 00:13:54.133 position:30% line:89% align:start
- Oh forget it.

00:13:54.166 --> 00:13:55.768 position:38% line:89% align:start
(grunts)

00:13:55.801 --> 00:13:58.337 position:30% line:89% align:start
(upbeat music)

00:14:02.006 --> 00:14:04.142 position:13% line:89% align:start
- Now listen here, Mattis!

00:14:05.809 --> 00:14:09.679 position:24% line:83% align:start
We barely survived
the harsh winter.

00:14:09.712 --> 00:14:11.781 position:21% line:89% align:start
We're all exhausted.

00:14:11.814 --> 00:14:13.382 position:24% line:83% align:start
- Do you think I'll
give you the loot

00:14:13.416 --> 00:14:16.252 position:13% line:89% align:start
if you whimper like a baby?

00:14:16.285 --> 00:14:19.087 position:7% line:89% align:start
- I'm not asking for all of it.

00:14:19.121 --> 00:14:21.423 position:16% line:89% align:start
We can split it two ways.

00:14:21.456 --> 00:14:22.923 position:33% line:89% align:start
- You're mad!

00:14:22.957 --> 00:14:24.992 position:27% line:89% align:start
Go away, goodbye!

00:14:25.025 --> 00:14:27.027 position:38% line:89% align:start
(grunts)

00:14:27.861 --> 00:14:29.229 position:21% line:89% align:start
- [Borka] Stop that!

00:14:29.262 --> 00:14:31.297 position:13% line:89% align:start
- [Mattis] Go on, go away!

00:14:31.331 --> 00:14:32.798 position:38% line:89% align:start
(growls)

00:14:32.831 --> 00:14:34.766 position:10% line:89% align:start
- You're a hard-headed brute.

00:14:36.168 --> 00:14:41.105 position:13% line:83% align:start
Undis will never forgive me
if I go home empty-handed.

00:14:41.139 --> 00:14:43.341 position:35% line:89% align:start
(laughing)

00:14:45.276 --> 00:14:49.146 position:24% line:83% align:start
- Big man Borka is
afraid of little Undis?

00:14:49.179 --> 00:14:51.714 position:7% line:89% align:start
Wait until the boys hear that.

00:14:51.747 --> 00:14:55.017 position:27% line:83% align:start
Borka the mighty,
scared of his wife!

00:14:55.050 --> 00:14:56.751 position:21% line:89% align:start
- You're one to talk.

00:14:57.852 --> 00:14:59.288 position:41% line:89% align:start
Mattis,

00:14:59.321 --> 00:15:02.823 position:27% line:83% align:start
you won't always
have the advantage.

00:15:02.857 --> 00:15:05.426 position:24% line:89% align:start
(mockingly grunts)

00:15:09.096 --> 00:15:11.931 position:27% line:89% align:start
(hooves pounding)

00:15:14.901 --> 00:15:16.202 position:35% line:89% align:start
Wait! Wait!

00:15:17.035 --> 00:15:19.104 position:16% line:89% align:start
Don't be rash, it's fine.

00:15:19.137 --> 00:15:21.072 position:41% line:89% align:start
(gasps)

00:15:24.275 --> 00:15:26.410 position:35% line:89% align:start
(whinnying)

00:15:29.313 --> 00:15:30.813 position:24% line:89% align:start
(arrow whizzing by)

00:15:30.847 --> 00:15:32.949 position:38% line:89% align:start
(screams)

00:15:36.385 --> 00:15:39.421 position:27% line:89% align:start
(horses snorting)

00:15:44.292 --> 00:15:46.494 position:10% line:89% align:start
- They must both be thirsty.

00:15:46.527 --> 00:15:48.361 position:27% line:89% align:start
Let's get water.

00:15:48.395 --> 00:15:50.830 position:7% line:89% align:start
- They're going to drink a lot.

00:15:50.864 --> 00:15:53.999 position:19% line:83% align:start
I know, we should take
them both down to the lake.

00:15:54.033 --> 00:15:57.036 position:21% line:89% align:start
(sighs in agreement)

00:16:01.773 --> 00:16:04.075 position:35% line:89% align:start
(footsteps)

00:16:12.449 --> 00:16:14.483 position:35% line:89% align:start
(laughing)

00:16:15.784 --> 00:16:18.887 position:21% line:89% align:start
(lighthearted music)

00:16:45.009 --> 00:16:47.811 position:30% line:83% align:start
- [Birk] We've
tamed them at last.

00:16:48.979 --> 00:16:52.215 position:21% line:83% align:start
- [Ronja] That didn't
take long, did it?

00:16:52.249 --> 00:16:55.251 position:21% line:89% align:start
(lighthearted music)

00:17:02.357 --> 00:17:04.925 position:30% line:83% align:start
When I say I'm
going to ride you,

00:17:04.958 --> 00:17:06.427 position:35% line:89% align:start
I mean it.

00:17:06.461 --> 00:17:07.327 position:35% line:89% align:start
Understand?

00:17:09.263 --> 00:17:10.930 position:38% line:89% align:start
(snorts)

00:17:10.963 --> 00:17:12.832 position:38% line:89% align:start
(grunts)

00:17:12.865 --> 00:17:15.034 position:27% line:89% align:start
Well then, ready?

00:17:15.067 --> 00:17:15.935 position:35% line:83% align:start
Let's ride.
(whinnies)

00:17:15.968 --> 00:17:17.270 position:38% line:89% align:start
(screams)

00:17:17.303 --> 00:17:20.071 position:27% line:89% align:start
(water splashing)

00:17:25.409 --> 00:17:27.378 position:38% line:89% align:start
(gasping)

00:17:36.352 --> 00:17:38.353 position:41% line:89% align:start
(sighs)

00:17:44.959 --> 00:17:47.927 position:27% line:89% align:start
(water splashing)

00:17:47.961 --> 00:17:49.963 position:38% line:89% align:start
(groans)

00:17:53.866 --> 00:17:56.101 position:35% line:89% align:start
(giggling)

00:17:58.936 --> 00:18:01.205 position:35% line:89% align:start
(laughing)

00:18:09.279 --> 00:18:11.381 position:21% line:89% align:start
That's it, I'm done.

00:18:11.415 --> 00:18:13.115 position:21% line:89% align:start
No more riding today.

00:18:14.450 --> 00:18:16.452 position:13% line:89% align:start
- I think I'm done as well.

00:18:16.485 --> 00:18:18.853 position:35% line:89% align:start
(laughing)

00:18:26.393 --> 00:18:29.296 position:24% line:89% align:start
(soft flute music)

00:18:36.502 --> 00:18:39.438 position:27% line:89% align:start
(wings flapping)

00:18:57.419 --> 00:19:01.590 position:16% line:83% align:start
- I'm just enjoying that
fact that spring has come.

00:19:04.492 --> 00:19:06.461 position:5% line:89% align:start
Come on, I must be able to think

00:19:06.494 --> 00:19:08.562 position:21% line:83% align:start
of a good reason why
I've been out all day.

00:19:08.596 --> 00:19:10.330 position:16% line:83% align:start
There must be a thousand
things I can say

00:19:10.364 --> 00:19:14.033 position:24% line:83% align:start
to Mattis that have
nothing to do with Birk.

00:19:14.066 --> 00:19:17.169 position:21% line:89% align:start
(soft fast footsteps)

00:19:27.277 --> 00:19:29.946 position:30% line:89% align:start
(door creaking)

00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:34.083 position:24% line:89% align:start
(distant footsteps)

00:19:37.453 --> 00:19:40.122 position:41% line:89% align:start
(gasps)

00:19:40.155 --> 00:19:42.557 position:33% line:89% align:start
(door bangs)

00:19:42.591 --> 00:19:44.659 position:35% line:89% align:start
(footsteps)

00:19:55.635 --> 00:19:57.636 position:41% line:89% align:start
(gasps)

00:20:00.606 --> 00:20:02.641 position:35% line:89% align:start
(groaning)

00:20:05.143 --> 00:20:05.976 position:38% line:89% align:start
Sturkas!

00:20:07.578 --> 00:20:09.679 position:19% line:89% align:start
Sturkas, what happened?

00:20:09.714 --> 00:20:11.014 position:41% line:89% align:start
(roars)

00:20:11.047 --> 00:20:12.649 position:21% line:89% align:start
Those Borka Robbers!

00:20:13.650 --> 00:20:15.317 position:21% line:89% align:start
Curse those bandits!

00:20:17.119 --> 00:20:18.621 position:24% line:89% align:start
Just you watch me.

00:20:20.489 --> 00:20:21.523 position:35% line:89% align:start
This time,

00:20:23.291 --> 00:20:24.492 position:27% line:89% align:start
once and for all,

00:20:26.093 --> 00:20:27.127 position:30% line:89% align:start
I'll grab them

00:20:28.429 --> 00:20:32.633 position:21% line:83% align:start
one by one, and throw
them to the depths of-

00:20:32.666 --> 00:20:34.000 position:27% line:89% align:start
- [Lovis] Mattis!

00:20:40.639 --> 00:20:42.707 position:38% line:89% align:start
(groans)

00:20:44.509 --> 00:20:45.543 position:41% line:89% align:start
(sighs)

00:20:45.576 --> 00:20:48.679 position:13% line:89% align:start
- Borka's gang are animals.

00:20:50.681 --> 00:20:52.615 position:16% line:89% align:start
- What exactly happened?

00:20:52.649 --> 00:20:55.718 position:21% line:83% align:start
- Mattis and the lads
set up an ambush,

00:20:55.752 --> 00:20:58.720 position:24% line:83% align:start
down in the forest
by Robbers' Walk.

00:20:58.754 --> 00:21:01.657 position:27% line:83% align:start
By good fortune,
some merchants passed

00:21:01.690 --> 00:21:03.692 position:13% line:89% align:start
with a wagon full of loot,

00:21:03.725 --> 00:21:07.160 position:19% line:83% align:start
and they handed it all
over without a fight.

00:21:07.194 --> 00:21:11.331 position:21% line:83% align:start
Well, they had no way
of defending themselves!

00:21:11.364 --> 00:21:13.533 position:35% line:89% align:start
(chuckles)

00:21:15.735 --> 00:21:18.504 position:10% line:89% align:start
And then guess what happened?

00:21:18.537 --> 00:21:21.406 position:24% line:83% align:start
When they finished
loading up the horses

00:21:21.439 --> 00:21:24.175 position:27% line:83% align:start
and were ready to
head back home...

00:21:25.443 --> 00:21:28.278 position:27% line:89% align:start
(slow soft music)

00:21:31.548 --> 00:21:34.217 position:33% line:89% align:start
(soft groans)

00:21:34.250 --> 00:21:35.685 position:41% line:89% align:start
(sighs)

00:21:35.718 --> 00:21:39.622 position:10% line:83% align:start
- I can't believe they would
shoot him with an arrow.

00:21:39.655 --> 00:21:42.090 position:13% line:89% align:start
- We should have shot back!

00:21:42.123 --> 00:21:43.625 position:30% line:89% align:start
- That's right!

00:21:43.658 --> 00:21:45.025 position:19% line:89% align:start
Let's give it to them,

00:21:45.059 --> 00:21:47.761 position:30% line:83% align:start
just like they
gave it to Sturkas.

00:21:47.795 --> 00:21:50.431 position:27% line:89% align:start
(angrily growls)

00:21:50.464 --> 00:21:53.399 position:27% line:89% align:start
(fists pounding)

00:21:53.433 --> 00:21:54.367 position:33% line:89% align:start
- Just wait.

00:21:55.301 --> 00:21:57.704 position:19% line:89% align:start
This is only the start.

00:21:57.737 --> 00:22:01.105 position:24% line:83% align:start
I'll crush each one
of them in turn.

00:22:01.138 --> 00:22:01.773 position:35% line:89% align:start
Up 'til now

00:22:03.609 --> 00:22:05.476 position:19% line:89% align:start
I've remained peaceful.

00:22:06.377 --> 00:22:07.311 position:27% line:89% align:start
(hands smacking)

00:22:07.345 --> 00:22:08.713 position:38% line:89% align:start
No more!

00:22:08.746 --> 00:22:12.082 position:24% line:83% align:start
Now I'll put an end
to all Borka Robbers!

00:22:13.283 --> 00:22:15.652 position:24% line:83% align:start
- But what if Borka
plans the same thing?

00:22:15.685 --> 00:22:17.486 position:21% line:89% align:start
And they come for us

00:22:17.520 --> 00:22:20.789 position:13% line:83% align:start
and they try to put an end
to all Mattis' Robbers?

00:22:20.823 --> 00:22:23.491 position:33% line:83% align:start
Have you ever
thought about that?

00:22:26.461 --> 00:22:29.296 position:7% line:89% align:start
- Borka wouldn't dare do that.

00:22:29.329 --> 00:22:31.732 position:30% line:83% align:start
We have nothing
to fear from them.

00:22:31.765 --> 00:22:33.700 position:16% line:89% align:start
I think we end this now!

00:22:35.701 --> 00:22:39.070 position:21% line:83% align:start
- That's the trouble,
you don't think.

00:22:46.644 --> 00:22:48.445 position:24% line:89% align:start
- Hey, don't worry.

00:22:49.647 --> 00:22:51.815 position:16% line:89% align:start
They can't finish me off;

00:22:51.849 --> 00:22:53.483 position:24% line:89% align:start
not with one shot.

00:22:55.184 --> 00:22:56.352 position:30% line:89% align:start
- No, Sturkas.

00:22:57.554 --> 00:23:00.088 position:24% line:83% align:start
There's no way they
can finish you off

00:23:00.122 --> 00:23:01.723 position:21% line:89% align:start
with just one arrow.

00:23:04.860 --> 00:23:07.395 position:24% line:83% align:start
- [Narrator] Ronja
shed no tears,

00:23:07.428 --> 00:23:10.130 position:27% line:83% align:start
but in her heart
she was weeping.

00:23:20.406 --> 00:23:22.140 position:21% line:89% align:start
(upbeat Celtic music)

00:23:22.173 --> 00:23:25.610 position:24% line:83% align:start
Next time on Ronja,
the Robber's Daughter.

00:23:29.646 --> 00:23:32.114 position:10% line:89% align:start
"Endless Fighting, Part One".

00:23:33.382 --> 00:23:34.550 position:30% line:89% align:start
Don't miss it.

00:23:36.586 --> 00:23:39.589 position:24% line:89% align:start
(soft upbeat music)
