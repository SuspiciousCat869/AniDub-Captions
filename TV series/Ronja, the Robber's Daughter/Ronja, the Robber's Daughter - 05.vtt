- Ronja, you can jump this.

00:01:48.027 --> 00:01:49.929 position:19% line:83% align:start
- [Narrator] As summer
turned to Autumn, Ronja

00:01:49.962 --> 00:01:52.096 position:16% line:89% align:start
practiced being fearless.

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:53.831 position:24% line:83% align:start
She decided to test
herself by going to

00:01:53.864 --> 00:01:58.432 position:19% line:83% align:start
the top of the fort to
leap across Hell's Gap.

00:01:58.465 --> 00:02:02.635 position:13% line:83% align:start
When she got there, she was
astonished to find a stranger.

00:02:02.669 --> 00:02:03.937 position:30% line:89% align:start
Another child?

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:06.004 position:27% line:89% align:start
At Mattis' fort?

00:02:06.038 --> 00:02:06.804 position:38% line:89% align:start
But how?

00:02:27.116 --> 00:02:29.750 position:16% line:89% align:start
- Hey, robber's daughter!

00:02:29.784 --> 00:02:31.451 position:21% line:89% align:start
I know you, yes I do.

00:02:32.919 --> 00:02:37.089 position:21% line:83% align:start
I've seen you running
around the forest.

00:02:37.122 --> 00:02:39.423 position:16% line:89% align:start
- Well, I don't know you.

00:02:40.724 --> 00:02:44.392 position:21% line:83% align:start
Tell me then, how did
you get into our fort?

00:02:59.969 --> 00:03:03.004 position:10% line:89% align:start
- Wouldn't you like to know.

00:03:03.037 --> 00:03:07.906 position:19% line:83% align:start
I'm Birk Borkason, and
we moved in yesterday.

00:03:07.939 --> 00:03:08.807 position:44% line:89% align:start
- We?

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:09.607 position:38% line:89% align:start
Who's we?

00:03:11.809 --> 00:03:13.843 position:35% line:89% align:start
(giggling)

00:03:16.078 --> 00:03:18.646 position:19% line:89% align:start
- Borka, me, and Undis.

00:03:18.679 --> 00:03:20.981 position:7% line:89% align:start
And our band of twelve robbers.

00:03:31.786 --> 00:03:33.554 position:35% line:89% align:start
- Robbers?

00:03:33.587 --> 00:03:36.923 position:7% line:83% align:start
Do you mean to say those dirty
devils are in the North Fort?

00:03:36.956 --> 00:03:38.924 position:35% line:89% align:start
(laughing)

00:03:40.491 --> 00:03:42.726 position:19% line:89% align:start
- You've got it wrong.

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:46.862 position:16% line:83% align:start
You see, over here Borka
Robbers are decent people.

00:03:46.896 --> 00:03:48.930 position:16% line:83% align:start
But if it's dirty devils
you're looking for, I

00:03:48.963 --> 00:03:53.599 position:19% line:83% align:start
think they live on the
south side of this place.

00:03:53.633 --> 00:03:55.901 position:19% line:89% align:start
- You talking about us?

00:03:55.934 --> 00:03:57.202 position:13% line:89% align:start
- And for your information,

00:03:57.235 --> 00:04:00.103 position:30% line:83% align:start
this isn't the
North Fort anymore.

00:04:00.137 --> 00:04:03.939 position:21% line:83% align:start
As of last night it's
called Borka's Keep.

00:04:03.972 --> 00:04:05.806 position:19% line:89% align:start
Just you remember that!

00:04:07.908 --> 00:04:09.975 position:21% line:83% align:start
- You don't know who
you're dealing with.

00:04:10.009 --> 00:04:12.944 position:13% line:83% align:start
When Mattis finds out he'll
go mad and he'll throw you,

00:04:12.977 --> 00:04:17.980 position:13% line:83% align:start
and all your horrible Borka
thieves flying off this earth!

00:04:18.014 --> 00:04:18.947 position:41% line:89% align:start
- Yeah?

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:20.915 position:16% line:89% align:start
I'd like to see him try!

00:04:25.784 --> 00:04:27.618 position:16% line:89% align:start
- Oh no, this is serious.

00:04:27.652 --> 00:04:29.586 position:16% line:89% align:start
Who knows what he'll do.

00:04:32.855 --> 00:04:35.456 position:33% line:89% align:start
(angry yell)

00:04:55.101 --> 00:04:57.169 position:16% line:89% align:start
- What's wrong with you?

00:04:57.202 --> 00:04:58.803 position:21% line:89% align:start
Don't you feel well?

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:05.807 position:24% line:83% align:start
- If you dare come
here, I'll give

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:07.574 position:16% line:89% align:start
you a punch on the nose!

00:05:07.608 --> 00:05:09.777 position:35% line:89% align:start
(laughter)

00:05:17.881 --> 00:05:21.817 position:21% line:83% align:start
- Think you could do
that, robber's daughter?

00:05:34.258 --> 00:05:37.092 position:30% line:83% align:start
Not so cowardly
then, little girl.

00:05:42.896 --> 00:05:45.496 position:30% line:89% align:start
(upbeat music)

00:05:48.899 --> 00:05:50.900 position:21% line:89% align:start
Hey, what's going on?

00:05:50.933 --> 00:05:52.934 position:27% line:83% align:start
You were going to
punch me on the nose.

00:05:52.968 --> 00:05:55.070 position:24% line:89% align:start
So why didn't you?

00:05:55.103 --> 00:05:57.171 position:19% line:89% align:start
Here, I'm coming over.

00:05:57.204 --> 00:05:58.738 position:27% line:89% align:start
- I'm not scared!

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:42.763 position:38% line:89% align:start
- Aargh!

00:06:54.337 --> 00:06:57.905 position:24% line:83% align:start
- Oh no, he's been
swallowed up by Hell's Gap.

00:06:57.939 --> 00:06:59.006 position:16% line:89% align:start
I wish I'd never met him.

00:06:59.039 --> 00:07:01.540 position:7% line:89% align:start
Why did they have to come here?

00:07:01.574 --> 00:07:02.675 position:30% line:89% align:start
Why did I jump?

00:07:02.708 --> 00:07:04.776 position:10% line:89% align:start
We should never have jumped!

00:07:21.019 --> 00:07:22.953 position:41% line:89% align:start
(gasp)

00:07:30.325 --> 00:07:31.991 position:21% line:89% align:start
Don't you dare move!

00:07:34.659 --> 00:07:38.762 position:24% line:83% align:start
- I'll try not to,
but I don't know

00:07:38.795 --> 00:07:40.830 position:16% line:89% align:start
if I can keep my balance.

00:07:58.040 --> 00:08:00.775 position:30% line:83% align:start
- Put the rope
around your waist.

00:08:00.808 --> 00:08:04.310 position:19% line:83% align:start
If you can, tighten it
so you don't slip out.

00:08:12.648 --> 00:08:15.083 position:21% line:83% align:start
When it's around you,
start climbing up.

00:08:15.116 --> 00:08:17.017 position:10% line:89% align:start
Only when I tell you, right?

00:08:17.051 --> 00:08:18.851 position:21% line:89% align:start
Understand me, Birk?

00:08:25.789 --> 00:08:27.123 position:27% line:89% align:start
Birk, climb now!

00:08:33.660 --> 00:08:34.294 position:38% line:89% align:start
- Aaargh!

00:08:44.833 --> 00:08:47.069 position:35% line:89% align:start
(grunting)

00:08:58.741 --> 00:09:01.976 position:21% line:83% align:start
- Hurry, will you or
I'll be cut in half.

00:09:03.877 --> 00:09:07.579 position:21% line:83% align:start
And I'll end up just
like this old castle!

00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:12.950 position:33% line:89% align:start
Climb faster!

00:09:23.656 --> 00:09:26.791 position:24% line:83% align:start
- [Birk] Ah, I see
you've fallen asleep!

00:09:29.326 --> 00:09:31.593 position:16% line:89% align:start
- Saving lives is tiring.

00:09:32.961 --> 00:09:35.863 position:33% line:83% align:start
Are you quite
finished jumping now?

00:09:37.164 --> 00:09:39.065 position:16% line:89% align:start
- I'm jumping once more.

00:09:39.099 --> 00:09:41.366 position:10% line:89% align:start
To get home to Borka's Keep.

00:09:44.868 --> 00:09:46.336 position:27% line:89% align:start
- Hold on, Birk!

00:09:46.369 --> 00:09:48.370 position:16% line:89% align:start
You give me back my rope!

00:09:51.672 --> 00:09:56.875 position:13% line:83% align:start
Because I'll not be tied to
you any longer than I have to!

00:09:56.908 --> 00:09:58.776 position:21% line:89% align:start
- No, of course not.

00:10:00.177 --> 00:10:02.878 position:27% line:83% align:start
But after what's
happened to us today.

00:10:02.911 --> 00:10:05.813 position:24% line:83% align:start
Maybe we'll be tied
together forever.

00:10:05.847 --> 00:10:06.747 position:41% line:89% align:start
(gasp)

00:10:06.781 --> 00:10:08.815 position:10% line:89% align:start
Even if it is without a rope.

00:10:08.849 --> 00:10:10.383 position:24% line:89% align:start
- Not on your life!

00:10:12.017 --> 00:10:15.819 position:19% line:83% align:start
All you Borka Robbers,
go jump off a cliff!

00:10:20.088 --> 00:10:22.256 position:21% line:83% align:start
- I wouldn't try that
again if I was you.

00:10:22.290 --> 00:10:23.723 position:24% line:89% align:start
It's unneighbourly.

00:10:23.756 --> 00:10:26.359 position:24% line:83% align:start
But I have to say,
it was incredibly

00:10:26.392 --> 00:10:29.394 position:10% line:89% align:start
nice of you to save my life.

00:10:29.428 --> 00:10:32.295 position:30% line:83% align:start
And for that my
friend I thank you.

00:10:36.298 --> 00:10:38.266 position:24% line:83% align:start
- How dare you call
me your friend,

00:10:38.299 --> 00:10:39.833 position:27% line:89% align:start
you can get lost!

00:10:43.902 --> 00:10:44.735 position:44% line:89% align:start
- Oi!

00:10:46.837 --> 00:10:48.338 position:24% line:89% align:start
Robber's daughter!

00:10:49.272 --> 00:10:50.873 position:24% line:89% align:start
I'll be seeing you!

00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:54.275 position:35% line:89% align:start
(laughter)

00:10:56.976 --> 00:11:01.045 position:16% line:83% align:start
- Oh no, not if I see you
first, you dirty devil!

00:11:04.881 --> 00:11:07.649 position:30% line:89% align:start
(upbeat music)

00:11:10.783 --> 00:11:13.652 position:30% line:89% align:start
(angry yelling)

00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:39.168 position:30% line:83% align:start
- For the first
time in your life,

00:11:39.201 --> 00:11:42.403 position:27% line:83% align:start
I'm going to have
to tell you off.

00:11:42.436 --> 00:11:43.903 position:41% line:89% align:start
Ronja!

00:11:46.005 --> 00:11:47.705 position:24% line:89% align:start
- And why is that?

00:11:48.872 --> 00:11:51.275 position:16% line:89% align:start
- A bit of joking around.

00:11:51.308 --> 00:11:53.775 position:21% line:83% align:start
Twisting the truth I
can allow that, but

00:11:53.808 --> 00:11:55.076 position:35% line:89% align:start
Ronja why?

00:11:56.478 --> 00:11:58.945 position:16% line:83% align:start
You mustn't make up such
ridiculous stories about vermin

00:11:58.978 --> 00:12:00.413 position:24% line:89% align:start
invading our fort.

00:12:03.848 --> 00:12:06.416 position:27% line:83% align:start
Borka's thieves,
in Mattis' Fort!

00:12:07.484 --> 00:12:11.252 position:24% line:83% align:start
Why would you ever
say such a thing?

00:12:11.286 --> 00:12:16.721 position:10% line:83% align:start
Even though I know it's just
a little joke you're playing.

00:12:16.755 --> 00:12:18.456 position:19% line:89% align:start
It makes my blood boil!

00:12:21.958 --> 00:12:24.960 position:7% line:89% align:start
- They all snuck in yesterday,

00:12:24.993 --> 00:12:29.829 position:16% line:83% align:start
Borka's son told me that,
all of them, with Undis and-

00:12:29.863 --> 00:12:31.231 position:38% line:89% align:start
- Enough!

00:12:31.264 --> 00:12:33.399 position:24% line:83% align:start
Borka does not have
a son and heir.

00:12:33.432 --> 00:12:36.401 position:19% line:83% align:start
Even if he did I would
have known about it!

00:12:36.434 --> 00:12:38.968 position:7% line:89% align:start
Did any of you know about this?

00:12:54.544 --> 00:12:55.378 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:12:56.878 --> 00:12:57.712 position:41% line:89% align:start
- Borka

00:12:58.780 --> 00:13:00.381 position:24% line:89% align:start
may have a son now.

00:13:04.816 --> 00:13:08.985 position:10% line:83% align:start
- [Robber] Apparently he was
born the same night as Ronja.

00:13:12.955 --> 00:13:14.822 position:24% line:83% align:start
- We heard Borka's
wife gave birth

00:13:14.855 --> 00:13:18.091 position:24% line:83% align:start
that night in sheer
terror of the thunder.

00:13:19.825 --> 00:13:21.227 position:27% line:89% align:start
- Aaaaaaaaaaaaa!

00:13:24.294 --> 00:13:28.231 position:21% line:83% align:start
And no one thought to
pass this information on?

00:13:32.066 --> 00:13:33.333 position:30% line:89% align:start
- What a waste!

00:13:35.268 --> 00:13:39.704 position:10% line:83% align:start
- What other devilish secrets
have you been keeping from me?

00:13:44.839 --> 00:13:48.741 position:16% line:83% align:start
And now that snake spawn
has infested our fort?

00:13:50.243 --> 00:13:53.777 position:19% line:83% align:start
You've really seen that
Borka scum here?

00:13:53.811 --> 00:13:56.779 position:30% line:83% align:start
Ronja, you said
you talked to him?

00:13:58.114 --> 00:14:01.450 position:19% line:83% align:start
- Actually, he started
the conversation.

00:14:20.594 --> 00:14:23.095 position:30% line:83% align:start
- That snake's
father has moved into

00:14:23.128 --> 00:14:25.497 position:27% line:83% align:start
the north side of
my fort with his

00:14:25.530 --> 00:14:29.466 position:10% line:89% align:start
thieving gang of robber scum?

00:14:29.499 --> 00:14:31.033 position:27% line:89% align:start
- That's not all.

00:14:31.066 --> 00:14:34.269 position:16% line:83% align:start
As of last night, they're
now calling it Borka's Keep

00:14:34.302 --> 00:14:37.169 position:27% line:83% align:start
whether you like
it or not, Mattis!

00:14:39.037 --> 00:14:41.206 position:38% line:89% align:start
(yelling)

00:14:56.447 --> 00:14:57.548 position:35% line:89% align:start
- Look out!

00:14:57.582 --> 00:14:58.348 position:41% line:89% align:start
- Run!

00:15:01.183 --> 00:15:03.418 position:13% line:89% align:start
- If you must throw things.

00:15:13.424 --> 00:15:16.192 position:7% line:89% align:start
Then why don't you throw these?

00:15:17.993 --> 00:15:20.894 position:27% line:83% align:start
You make a mess,
you clean it up.

00:15:20.927 --> 00:15:22.029 position:30% line:89% align:start
Remember that.

00:16:03.119 --> 00:16:03.952 position:41% line:89% align:start
- Oww!

00:16:09.089 --> 00:16:11.157 position:24% line:89% align:start
- This is our home.

00:16:12.525 --> 00:16:16.894 position:10% line:83% align:start
We're meant to be safe here,
like a fox in its lair!

00:16:21.463 --> 00:16:22.531 position:38% line:89% align:start
(crying)

00:16:22.564 --> 00:16:23.531 position:38% line:89% align:start
But now.

00:16:25.599 --> 00:16:27.933 position:38% line:89% align:start
(wailing)

00:16:33.537 --> 00:16:34.571 position:38% line:89% align:start
- Mattis?

00:16:47.345 --> 00:16:49.846 position:7% line:89% align:start
- That's quite enough of that.

00:16:56.283 --> 00:16:58.150 position:30% line:83% align:start
If you've got a
head full of lice,

00:16:58.184 --> 00:17:01.586 position:21% line:83% align:start
screaming like a baby
won't get rid of them.

00:17:06.988 --> 00:17:08.523 position:38% line:89% align:start
So get up

00:17:12.158 --> 00:17:16.994 position:27% line:89% align:start
and do something.

00:17:26.267 --> 00:17:31.437 position:16% line:83% align:start
Throwing this meat around
has made it nice and tender.

00:17:31.471 --> 00:17:33.438 position:38% line:89% align:start
(gasping)

00:18:08.991 --> 00:18:11.494 position:7% line:89% align:start
- Mattis, please don't be sad.

00:18:13.261 --> 00:18:18.598 position:10% line:83% align:start
All you have to do is go over
there and throw them out.

00:18:18.631 --> 00:18:20.931 position:16% line:89% align:start
- But that's not so easy.

00:18:42.411 --> 00:18:47.714 position:16% line:83% align:start
- How do we get the Borka
Robbers, out of the fort?

00:18:47.747 --> 00:18:50.315 position:24% line:83% align:start
- First of all, how
were they able to

00:18:50.349 --> 00:18:52.583 position:7% line:89% align:start
get in without us seeing them?

00:18:53.984 --> 00:18:56.318 position:24% line:83% align:start
- To do that, they
would have had to

00:18:56.352 --> 00:18:58.387 position:13% line:89% align:start
pass through Wolf's Valley.

00:18:59.454 --> 00:19:01.622 position:24% line:83% align:start
We keep watch there
day and night.

00:19:01.655 --> 00:19:04.424 position:24% line:83% align:start
They couldn't have
passed through.

00:19:07.592 --> 00:19:11.161 position:16% line:83% align:start
- And how come none of us
have seen them over there?

00:19:11.194 --> 00:19:14.163 position:35% line:89% align:start
(groaning)

00:19:14.196 --> 00:19:15.062 position:35% line:89% align:start
- I got it!

00:19:16.631 --> 00:19:18.532 position:19% line:89% align:start
They came from the sky!

00:19:19.699 --> 00:19:21.333 position:10% line:89% align:start
- [Tjorm] You think so, fool?

00:19:21.367 --> 00:19:23.368 position:35% line:89% align:start
(laughter)

00:19:26.103 --> 00:19:28.104 position:16% line:89% align:start
Maybe they dug a tunnel?

00:19:29.171 --> 00:19:31.205 position:7% line:89% align:start
- [Robber] What, through rock?

00:19:31.239 --> 00:19:32.006 position:38% line:89% align:start
Doubtful.

00:19:39.677 --> 00:19:44.046 position:16% line:83% align:start
- Then it could only have
been through Wolf Valley.

00:19:47.215 --> 00:19:48.415 position:35% line:89% align:start
(laughing)

00:19:48.449 --> 00:19:50.216 position:7% line:89% align:start
So you think they'd just walked

00:19:50.249 --> 00:19:52.452 position:13% line:89% align:start
right up Wolf's Valley, eh.

00:19:52.485 --> 00:19:53.718 position:7% line:89% align:start
Walked straight up to the fort

00:19:53.752 --> 00:19:55.554 position:27% line:83% align:start
and said "Hello,
dear friends, we

00:19:55.587 --> 00:19:57.455 position:24% line:83% align:start
Borka Robbers have
decided to move

00:19:57.488 --> 00:19:59.656 position:30% line:89% align:start
into your fort,

00:20:01.089 --> 00:20:02.089 position:24% line:89% align:start
and we're sure you

00:20:02.123 --> 00:20:03.458 position:16% line:89% align:start
won't mind one bit, eh?"

00:20:05.759 --> 00:20:08.360 position:24% line:83% align:start
- Since you seem to
know so much, how

00:20:08.394 --> 00:20:10.428 position:21% line:89% align:start
did they get in then?

00:20:10.462 --> 00:20:12.996 position:5% line:89% align:start
- I tell you, not through Wolf's

00:20:13.030 --> 00:20:15.465 position:7% line:89% align:start
Valley or flying or tunneling.

00:20:16.364 --> 00:20:18.366 position:16% line:89% align:start
From the north side, eh.

00:20:20.301 --> 00:20:23.302 position:27% line:83% align:start
We haven't got a
guard on that side.

00:20:26.637 --> 00:20:29.573 position:21% line:83% align:start
- Why should we keep
a guard over there?

00:20:29.606 --> 00:20:31.440 position:24% line:83% align:start
There's no entrance
on that side,

00:20:31.474 --> 00:20:34.042 position:5% line:89% align:start
only a sheer drop to the ground.

00:20:35.543 --> 00:20:38.444 position:10% line:83% align:start
Unless you think they're like
flies or spiders who can climb

00:20:38.478 --> 00:20:40.512 position:19% line:89% align:start
straight into the air.

00:20:47.082 --> 00:20:48.417 position:38% line:89% align:start
Hang on.

00:20:48.450 --> 00:20:52.018 position:13% line:83% align:start
Ronja, What were you doing
on the roof anyway?

00:20:53.453 --> 00:20:54.688 position:44% line:89% align:start
- Me?

00:20:54.721 --> 00:20:58.456 position:10% line:83% align:start
I was just watching out that
I didn't fall into Hell's Gap.

00:21:01.190 --> 00:21:02.024 position:41% line:89% align:start
- Hmm.

00:21:06.427 --> 00:21:07.661 position:24% line:83% align:start
- [Ronja] I should
have asked Birk

00:21:07.695 --> 00:21:09.362 position:5% line:89% align:start
to explain how the Borka Robbers

00:21:09.395 --> 00:21:12.397 position:27% line:83% align:start
managed to sneak
into the North Fort.

00:21:13.498 --> 00:21:16.032 position:10% line:89% align:start
- Wouldn't you like to know?

00:21:23.704 --> 00:21:25.505 position:24% line:89% align:start
- Ronja, sleep now.

00:21:33.510 --> 00:21:37.245 position:19% line:83% align:start
- From tonight, we set
guards on the roof.

00:21:37.278 --> 00:21:38.513 position:38% line:89% align:start
Sturkas.

00:21:38.546 --> 00:21:39.346 position:41% line:89% align:start
Tjegge.

00:21:39.379 --> 00:21:41.146 position:33% line:89% align:start
Lill-Klippen.

00:21:41.180 --> 00:21:42.348 position:33% line:89% align:start
- You got it.

00:21:42.381 --> 00:21:43.449 position:16% line:89% align:start
- Leave it to us, Mattis.

00:21:43.482 --> 00:21:44.582 position:30% line:89% align:start
- Don't worry.

00:21:46.316 --> 00:21:49.185 position:19% line:83% align:start
- Borka will be feeling
very pleased with himself.

00:21:49.218 --> 00:21:52.220 position:16% line:83% align:start
And he's stupid enough to
think he can push his luck.

00:21:52.254 --> 00:21:53.487 position:27% line:83% align:start
At any moment he
could come rushing

00:21:53.521 --> 00:21:55.489 position:5% line:89% align:start
over Hell's Gap like a wild bull

00:21:55.523 --> 00:21:56.656 position:27% line:83% align:start
and try to drive
us out of Mattis'

00:21:56.689 --> 00:21:59.291 position:7% line:89% align:start
Fort, lock, stock, and barrel.

00:22:01.092 --> 00:22:03.493 position:21% line:89% align:start
I'm going to bed now!

00:22:03.527 --> 00:22:05.327 position:30% line:89% align:start
Not for sleep.

00:22:05.361 --> 00:22:08.463 position:27% line:83% align:start
But to think, and
to curse my enemies.

00:22:11.598 --> 00:22:14.767 position:21% line:83% align:start
And woe betide anyone
who disturbs me!

00:22:17.434 --> 00:22:20.036 position:33% line:89% align:start
(soft music)

00:22:45.117 --> 00:22:46.652 position:30% line:89% align:start
- I thank you.

00:22:46.685 --> 00:22:48.586 position:24% line:89% align:start
Robber's daughter,

00:22:48.619 --> 00:22:50.320 position:24% line:89% align:start
I'll be seeing you!

00:22:54.690 --> 00:22:57.291 position:21% line:83% align:start
- [Narrator] At last,
Ronja had met someone of

00:22:57.324 --> 00:22:58.825 position:33% line:89% align:start
her own age.

00:22:58.859 --> 00:23:02.160 position:10% line:83% align:start
But of all the people in the
world, why did he have to be

00:23:02.193 --> 00:23:05.162 position:13% line:89% align:start
the son of a Borka Robber?

00:23:05.195 --> 00:23:07.797 position:27% line:83% align:start
That night, Ronja
wrestled with her feelings

00:23:07.830 --> 00:23:11.198 position:24% line:83% align:start
and found it rather
difficult to sleep.

00:23:21.638 --> 00:23:25.307 position:24% line:83% align:start
Next time on Ronja,
the Robber's Daughter,

00:23:29.710 --> 00:23:31.544 position:16% line:89% align:start
"Taking without Asking".

00:23:33.478 --> 00:23:34.646 position:30% line:89% align:start
Don't miss it!

00:23:38.815 --> 00:23:41.417 position:30% line:89% align:start
(upbeat music)
