- Because it's not your forest.

00:01:40.022 --> 00:01:44.293 position:21% line:83% align:start
The forest belongs to
everyone, including me!

00:01:44.326 --> 00:01:46.463 position:24% line:83% align:start
- [Narrator] Ronja
resented Birk's intrusion

00:01:46.496 --> 00:01:48.330 position:10% line:89% align:start
into her time in the forest,

00:01:48.365 --> 00:01:50.367 position:27% line:83% align:start
but she agreed to
help him find his way

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.201 position:13% line:89% align:start
through the deepening fog.

00:01:52.234 --> 00:01:54.471 position:10% line:89% align:start
But this was no ordinary fog,

00:01:54.504 --> 00:01:57.072 position:33% line:83% align:start
and Ronja was
tempted by the spell

00:01:57.106 --> 00:01:58.508 position:19% line:89% align:start
of the Unearthly Ones.

00:01:58.541 --> 00:02:01.009 position:16% line:89% align:start
Birk saved her from them,

00:02:01.043 --> 00:02:04.913 position:13% line:83% align:start
but she remembered nothing
of what had happened.

00:02:04.947 --> 00:02:07.384 position:33% line:89% align:start
(light music)

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:30.239 position:19% line:83% align:start
- I wonder when Mattis
will throw Borka out.

00:02:30.272 --> 00:02:32.475 position:30% line:83% align:start
He's determined
to get rid of him

00:02:32.509 --> 00:02:34.444 position:16% line:89% align:start
and his dirty devil son.

00:02:42.419 --> 00:02:45.522 position:21% line:83% align:start
And yet I wonder what
he's doing right now.

00:02:45.555 --> 00:02:47.624 position:38% line:89% align:start
(sighing)

00:02:47.657 --> 00:02:50.359 position:27% line:89% align:start
(horse neighing)

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:03.138 position:24% line:89% align:start
- Going out again?

00:03:03.172 --> 00:03:05.407 position:21% line:89% align:start
Having another look?

00:03:05.442 --> 00:03:10.379 position:19% line:83% align:start
All you do is look for
the elusive Borka Robbers.

00:03:10.412 --> 00:03:13.215 position:30% line:83% align:start
Try using your
head a little, eh?

00:03:14.517 --> 00:03:15.618 position:35% line:89% align:start
(chuckling)

00:03:15.652 --> 00:03:17.252 position:16% line:89% align:start
- Use my head, was that?

00:03:17.286 --> 00:03:20.490 position:24% line:83% align:start
If you want to keep
yours, do some work.

00:03:20.523 --> 00:03:23.493 position:21% line:83% align:start
- Sure, cleaning the
floors is much more useful

00:03:23.526 --> 00:03:27.396 position:21% line:83% align:start
than whatever you're
doing (laughing).

00:03:27.429 --> 00:03:31.534 position:35% line:89% align:start
- Let's go!

00:03:34.504 --> 00:03:36.473 position:38% line:89% align:start
(sighing)

00:03:49.184 --> 00:03:51.754 position:7% line:89% align:start
- It's as quiet as a graveyard.

00:03:51.788 --> 00:03:53.656 position:24% line:89% align:start
- Makes me nervous.

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:55.592 position:27% line:89% align:start
Can't see anyone.

00:03:55.625 --> 00:03:59.194 position:7% line:83% align:start
- Neither can I, but they have
to be using this rock face

00:03:59.228 --> 00:04:01.498 position:13% line:89% align:start
to get in and out of there.

00:04:05.434 --> 00:04:10.540 position:7% line:83% align:start
- But Chief, you're not saying
we should climb up that!

00:04:10.573 --> 00:04:12.341 position:19% line:89% align:start
- I have a better way.

00:04:13.175 --> 00:04:16.178 position:24% line:89% align:start
(suspenseful music)

00:04:48.845 --> 00:04:52.582 position:38% line:89% align:start
And down.

00:04:52.615 --> 00:04:54.584 position:35% line:89% align:start
(grunting)

00:05:04.493 --> 00:05:07.329 position:27% line:89% align:start
(arrow vibrating)

00:05:10.232 --> 00:05:12.769 position:27% line:89% align:start
(rocks crashing)

00:05:13.903 --> 00:05:16.371 position:35% line:89% align:start
(grunting)

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:30.519 position:27% line:89% align:start
(rocks cracking)

00:05:31.486 --> 00:05:35.658 position:35% line:83% align:start
(grunting)
(screaming)

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:43.565 position:27% line:89% align:start
(rocks crashing)

00:05:56.679 --> 00:05:58.213 position:30% line:89% align:start
- Now, come on.

00:05:58.246 --> 00:06:00.750 position:19% line:89% align:start
Just like I showed you.

00:06:00.783 --> 00:06:03.185 position:35% line:89% align:start
(grunting)

00:06:05.622 --> 00:06:07.857 position:30% line:89% align:start
- Are you sure?

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:09.424 position:30% line:89% align:start
- Don't worry.

00:06:09.458 --> 00:06:11.593 position:10% line:89% align:start
They won't see us down here.

00:06:14.697 --> 00:06:16.733 position:33% line:89% align:start
(whimpering)

00:06:16.766 --> 00:06:18.701 position:13% line:89% align:start
- This is such a bad idea.

00:06:18.735 --> 00:06:21.269 position:30% line:89% align:start
(wood snapping)

00:06:21.303 --> 00:06:23.572 position:35% line:89% align:start
(screaming)

00:06:27.677 --> 00:06:29.211 position:16% line:89% align:start
- Don't just stand there.

00:06:29.244 --> 00:06:30.913 position:33% line:89% align:start
Bring him up!

00:06:30.947 --> 00:06:33.650 position:35% line:89% align:start
(screaming)

00:06:33.683 --> 00:06:35.885 position:21% line:89% align:start
- It hit the ceiling.

00:06:35.918 --> 00:06:37.820 position:10% line:89% align:start
- You idiots, pull him back.

00:06:37.854 --> 00:06:39.856 position:35% line:89% align:start
- We can't!

00:06:39.889 --> 00:06:41.590 position:21% line:89% align:start
It just won't budge.

00:06:41.623 --> 00:06:43.291 position:35% line:89% align:start
(screaming)

00:06:43.325 --> 00:06:45.962 position:33% line:89% align:start
- Help! Help!

00:06:45.995 --> 00:06:48.597 position:30% line:89% align:start
(wood rattling)

00:07:07.817 --> 00:07:10.352 position:35% line:89% align:start
(grumbling)

00:07:12.621 --> 00:07:14.857 position:24% line:83% align:start
- You need to be as
cunning as a fox.

00:07:14.891 --> 00:07:17.960 position:19% line:83% align:start
Time to approach things
in a different way.

00:07:17.994 --> 00:07:20.763 position:24% line:83% align:start
We need to outsmart
that scoundrel.

00:07:20.797 --> 00:07:22.965 position:13% line:89% align:start
You can't always use force!

00:07:22.999 --> 00:07:25.367 position:35% line:89% align:start
(groaning)

00:07:30.639 --> 00:07:34.711 position:16% line:83% align:start
- Looks like we won't be
back robbing anytime soon.

00:07:34.744 --> 00:07:36.478 position:19% line:89% align:start
- And Borka's men too.

00:07:36.511 --> 00:07:39.716 position:16% line:83% align:start
That lot haven't left the
Keep since they got here.

00:07:39.749 --> 00:07:45.353 position:10% line:83% align:start
- And so now Robbers Walk is
the safest path in the forest.

00:07:45.387 --> 00:07:47.622 position:35% line:89% align:start
(growling)

00:07:53.062 --> 00:07:55.630 position:30% line:89% align:start
(chord strums)

00:08:01.303 --> 00:08:03.773 position:33% line:89% align:start
(light music)

00:08:14.050 --> 00:08:16.318 position:24% line:89% align:start
- This is the life.

00:08:16.351 --> 00:08:19.421 position:21% line:83% align:start
Haven't seen robbers
around for days.

00:08:19.454 --> 00:08:21.590 position:7% line:89% align:start
- Well, perhaps they all left.

00:08:21.623 --> 00:08:23.658 position:21% line:89% align:start
We all must move on.

00:08:23.692 --> 00:08:27.362 position:16% line:83% align:start
Or perhaps my music sent
them into a slumber,

00:08:27.395 --> 00:08:31.768 position:21% line:83% align:start
or maybe the ever so
divine wonderful music

00:08:31.801 --> 00:08:34.469 position:7% line:89% align:start
you play has scared them away.

00:08:34.503 --> 00:08:36.705 position:35% line:89% align:start
(laughing)

00:08:38.540 --> 00:08:41.543 position:27% line:83% align:start
- Leave all your
belongings and run.

00:08:43.678 --> 00:08:46.481 position:24% line:89% align:start
- Oh, dear me, no!

00:08:46.515 --> 00:08:49.551 position:35% line:89% align:start
(laughing)

00:08:49.584 --> 00:08:53.455 position:13% line:83% align:start
- Stop messing around back
there and play something.

00:08:53.488 --> 00:08:55.724 position:33% line:89% align:start
(light music)

00:09:06.601 --> 00:09:09.371 position:27% line:89% align:start
(rain drizzling)

00:09:25.822 --> 00:09:27.756 position:27% line:89% align:start
- It's deserted.

00:09:27.789 --> 00:09:31.861 position:27% line:83% align:start
No sign of Borka
Robbers around here.

00:09:31.894 --> 00:09:33.896 position:35% line:89% align:start
(cheering)

00:09:35.564 --> 00:09:38.835 position:19% line:83% align:start
- Finally, we can leave
this horrible forest.

00:09:38.868 --> 00:09:40.502 position:27% line:89% align:start
- Can we really?

00:09:40.535 --> 00:09:44.673 position:13% line:83% align:start
What about that other tribe
holding fast over there?

00:09:44.706 --> 00:09:47.143 position:24% line:83% align:start
- There's no place
worse than that castle.

00:09:47.176 --> 00:09:50.779 position:21% line:83% align:start
That sly robber chief
is impossible to catch.

00:09:50.812 --> 00:09:54.649 position:16% line:83% align:start
Even harder than catching
an eagle on a cliff top.

00:09:54.683 --> 00:09:59.121 position:24% line:83% align:start
Come on, men, we're
pulling out for the year.

00:09:59.155 --> 00:10:02.691 position:30% line:89% align:start
Let's go home.

00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:08.730 position:27% line:89% align:start
(exciting music)

00:10:16.705 --> 00:10:18.473 position:30% line:89% align:start
- So it's true.

00:10:18.506 --> 00:10:22.611 position:13% line:83% align:start
This rock face is the only
way to get inside the place.

00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:35.757 position:21% line:83% align:start
And now you've shown
yourselves, you dirty devils!

00:10:35.790 --> 00:10:38.727 position:30% line:89% align:start
(playful music)

00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:40.963 position:35% line:89% align:start
(groaning)

00:10:47.469 --> 00:10:49.906 position:38% line:89% align:start
Why you!

00:10:49.939 --> 00:10:51.840 position:38% line:89% align:start
(yelping)

00:11:01.883 --> 00:11:03.185 position:19% line:89% align:start
- (panting) It's okay.

00:11:03.219 --> 00:11:04.819 position:21% line:89% align:start
No problem, I'm fine.

00:11:04.853 --> 00:11:08.024 position:19% line:89% align:start
I'm brave (screaming).

00:11:08.057 --> 00:11:09.992 position:16% line:89% align:start
- Bring me the bog moss.

00:11:15.197 --> 00:11:18.733 position:19% line:89% align:start
- (whimpering) Help me!

00:11:19.901 --> 00:11:22.071 position:27% line:83% align:start
- Stop that noise
and whimpering.

00:11:22.104 --> 00:11:23.940 position:27% line:83% align:start
Hush up, stay in
bed for a few days,

00:11:23.973 --> 00:11:25.241 position:24% line:89% align:start
and you'll be fine.

00:11:25.274 --> 00:11:28.044 position:41% line:89% align:start
- Sure.

00:11:32.614 --> 00:11:34.516 position:21% line:89% align:start
- Hey, Lill-Klippen.

00:11:34.549 --> 00:11:35.917 position:33% line:89% align:start
- Yes, Ronja?

00:11:35.952 --> 00:11:38.687 position:30% line:83% align:start
- When you saw
the Borka Robbers,

00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:40.588 position:13% line:89% align:start
was there a boy with them?

00:11:40.622 --> 00:11:43.159 position:7% line:89% align:start
- A boy? You mean Borka's son?

00:11:43.192 --> 00:11:45.894 position:30% line:89% align:start
Ummm (laughs).

00:11:47.529 --> 00:11:49.931 position:7% line:89% align:start
I was too busy avoiding arrows.

00:11:49.966 --> 00:11:51.968 position:13% line:89% align:start
Well, all of them but one.

00:11:52.001 --> 00:11:55.204 position:24% line:83% align:start
They tried to kill
me but they missed.

00:11:55.237 --> 00:11:57.239 position:16% line:89% align:start
Next time I'll kill them.

00:11:58.540 --> 00:12:01.876 position:30% line:83% align:start
They'll regret
meeting me (yelping).

00:12:01.910 --> 00:12:05.147 position:13% line:89% align:start
My leg, my leg (groaning).

00:12:06.681 --> 00:12:10.552 position:21% line:83% align:start
- Now after all that
hunting, you found a ladder.

00:12:10.585 --> 00:12:13.888 position:19% line:83% align:start
You must be very proud
of yourself, Mattis.

00:12:21.297 --> 00:12:23.765 position:38% line:89% align:start
(yelling)

00:12:33.075 --> 00:12:35.744 position:30% line:89% align:start
(water rushing)

00:12:47.689 --> 00:12:51.160 position:19% line:89% align:start
- How soft the moss is.

00:12:59.667 --> 00:13:02.737 position:19% line:89% align:start
What a beautiful sound.

00:13:03.872 --> 00:13:07.309 position:27% line:89% align:start
Ah, smells nice.

00:13:38.274 --> 00:13:40.975 position:33% line:89% align:start
(light music)

00:13:43.079 --> 00:13:46.115 position:30% line:89% align:start
(leaves rustle)

00:13:46.148 --> 00:13:48.117 position:35% line:89% align:start
(giggling)

00:14:10.004 --> 00:14:11.973 position:33% line:89% align:start
Wild horses.

00:14:15.677 --> 00:14:17.679 position:41% line:89% align:start
(sighs)

00:14:20.982 --> 00:14:21.883 position:41% line:89% align:start
Hello.

00:14:33.395 --> 00:14:36.097 position:33% line:89% align:start
(light music)

00:14:43.938 --> 00:14:46.708 position:27% line:89% align:start
(rain drizzling)

00:15:02.957 --> 00:15:05.427 position:27% line:89% align:start
(metal scraping)

00:15:13.001 --> 00:15:17.071 position:27% line:89% align:start
- Me, I'm bored.

00:15:17.105 --> 00:15:21.210 position:16% line:83% align:start
- When there's nothing to
do, you can get out of shape.

00:15:23.379 --> 00:15:26.915 position:7% line:89% align:start
- What's for dinner, I wonder?

00:15:26.948 --> 00:15:28.217 position:16% line:89% align:start
It might be mutton soup.

00:15:28.250 --> 00:15:29.951 position:33% line:89% align:start
My favorite.

00:15:29.984 --> 00:15:32.388 position:27% line:83% align:start
- Please, that's
not nearly the best.

00:15:32.421 --> 00:15:34.423 position:24% line:89% align:start
It's chicken soup.

00:15:34.456 --> 00:15:36.090 position:30% line:89% align:start
- Chicken soup?

00:15:36.124 --> 00:15:38.159 position:13% line:89% align:start
Too greasy, it disgusts me.

00:15:38.194 --> 00:15:44.165 position:19% line:83% align:start
- Of course, that's why
you always stink of mutton.

00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:46.268 position:41% line:89% align:start
- What!

00:15:46.302 --> 00:15:48.304 position:33% line:89% align:start
- You heard!

00:15:48.337 --> 00:15:50.306 position:21% line:89% align:start
- You want to fight?

00:15:50.339 --> 00:15:53.808 position:27% line:83% align:start
- Calm yourself,
bunch of babies.

00:15:53.841 --> 00:15:55.377 position:24% line:89% align:start
- What did you say?

00:15:55.411 --> 00:15:59.180 position:27% line:83% align:start
- If I'm a baby,
you're a grandpa.

00:15:59.215 --> 00:16:02.016 position:13% line:89% align:start
- Grandpa? Say that again.

00:16:02.050 --> 00:16:03.851 position:16% line:89% align:start
- Calm down, all of you.

00:16:03.885 --> 00:16:05.153 position:24% line:89% align:start
You're all stupid.

00:16:05.186 --> 00:16:07.088 position:38% line:89% align:start
- Stupid?

00:16:07.121 --> 00:16:09.824 position:21% line:83% align:start
- Well, I think that
you're the stupid one!

00:16:09.857 --> 00:16:13.229 position:10% line:89% align:start
- Do you? Alright (growling).

00:16:13.262 --> 00:16:16.298 position:21% line:83% align:start
- Acting like babies,
you should all shut up.

00:16:16.332 --> 00:16:17.333 position:30% line:89% align:start
- What's that?

00:16:17.366 --> 00:16:18.766 position:35% line:89% align:start
Baby, am I?

00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:19.968 position:33% line:89% align:start
- Very funny.

00:16:20.001 --> 00:16:22.170 position:5% line:89% align:start
Borka made you weep like a baby.

00:16:22.203 --> 00:16:24.340 position:30% line:89% align:start
- How dare you!

00:16:24.373 --> 00:16:27.409 position:5% line:89% align:start
You do nothing but guard, Tjorm!

00:16:27.443 --> 00:16:29.345 position:16% line:89% align:start
- It's an important job!

00:16:29.378 --> 00:16:31.112 position:33% line:89% align:start
(snickering)

00:16:31.145 --> 00:16:34.916 position:21% line:83% align:start
Stop laughing or I'll
cover you all in manure.

00:16:37.218 --> 00:16:39.288 position:19% line:89% align:start
- Manure suits me fine.

00:16:39.321 --> 00:16:42.156 position:30% line:83% align:start
After all, I do
most of the farming.

00:16:43.525 --> 00:16:47.329 position:13% line:83% align:start
- Why are you arguing when
you know all food is good?

00:16:47.363 --> 00:16:49.298 position:16% line:89% align:start
- [All] Shut up, Knotas.

00:16:49.331 --> 00:16:50.231 position:30% line:89% align:start
Who asked you?

00:16:52.501 --> 00:16:55.003 position:24% line:89% align:start
(instrument strums)

00:16:55.036 --> 00:16:57.138 position:38% line:89% align:start
(yelping)

00:17:08.082 --> 00:17:11.287 position:27% line:89% align:start
- That's enough!

00:17:13.355 --> 00:17:16.292 position:27% line:83% align:start
Finally, a bit of
peace and quiet.

00:17:16.325 --> 00:17:18.893 position:24% line:83% align:start
I think you've gone
and burst my ear drum.

00:17:18.926 --> 00:17:21.262 position:21% line:83% align:start
Now act like the men
you're pretending to be

00:17:21.297 --> 00:17:24.333 position:27% line:83% align:start
and not the silly
babies you all are.

00:17:24.366 --> 00:17:26.868 position:38% line:89% align:start
(sighing)

00:17:26.901 --> 00:17:30.339 position:47% line:89% align:start
Hm.

00:17:34.410 --> 00:17:37.879 position:27% line:89% align:start
(rooster crowing)

00:17:37.912 --> 00:17:40.848 position:24% line:89% align:start
(chickens clucking)

00:17:44.586 --> 00:17:47.889 position:24% line:83% align:start
- I can't bear the
stench in here.

00:17:47.922 --> 00:17:51.893 position:19% line:83% align:start
- Well, it's your fault
for mocking chicken soup.

00:17:51.926 --> 00:17:54.962 position:21% line:83% align:start
- Haven't we cleaned
enough by now?

00:17:54.996 --> 00:17:56.432 position:27% line:89% align:start
This I do swear.

00:17:56.465 --> 00:17:58.567 position:27% line:83% align:start
No more fighting,
no more complaining.

00:17:58.600 --> 00:18:02.103 position:13% line:83% align:start
I won't even complain that
I can't fight anymore.

00:18:02.136 --> 00:18:04.340 position:27% line:89% align:start
(sheep bleating)

00:18:04.373 --> 00:18:06.307 position:16% line:89% align:start
- He doesn't believe you.

00:18:06.342 --> 00:18:08.644 position:38% line:89% align:start
Come on.

00:18:08.677 --> 00:18:11.079 position:35% line:89% align:start
(grunting)

00:18:25.026 --> 00:18:27.529 position:30% line:83% align:start
- Alright, who
wants to go hunting?

00:18:27.563 --> 00:18:29.964 position:38% line:89% align:start
(gasping)

00:18:29.997 --> 00:18:32.166 position:35% line:89% align:start
(cheering)

00:18:36.337 --> 00:18:38.540 position:33% line:89% align:start
(calm music)

00:19:06.300 --> 00:19:08.470 position:38% line:89% align:start
(sighing)

00:19:41.169 --> 00:19:42.236 position:27% line:89% align:start
- And that's it.

00:19:42.270 --> 00:19:44.440 position:24% line:89% align:start
The salting's done.

00:19:44.473 --> 00:19:47.375 position:27% line:83% align:start
That'll keep our
meat all winter.

00:19:47.408 --> 00:19:51.647 position:16% line:83% align:start
And the rest of it we'll
just smoke and put aside.

00:19:51.680 --> 00:19:53.347 position:19% line:89% align:start
- Good evening, Lovis.

00:19:53.381 --> 00:19:56.384 position:16% line:83% align:start
I was just wondering if I
could make a small request.

00:19:56.417 --> 00:19:57.586 position:44% line:89% align:start
- Hm?

00:19:57.619 --> 00:19:58.821 position:24% line:83% align:start
- As you're cooking
a delicious elk,

00:19:58.854 --> 00:20:04.693 position:13% line:83% align:start
remember all the tenderest
bits are for toothless old men.

00:20:04.726 --> 00:20:08.730 position:13% line:89% align:start
Old men like me (giggling).

00:20:08.764 --> 00:20:11.232 position:35% line:89% align:start
(chuckling)

00:20:14.636 --> 00:20:17.438 position:30% line:89% align:start
(upbeat music)

00:20:21.142 --> 00:20:23.545 position:33% line:89% align:start
(blabbering)

00:20:29.618 --> 00:20:32.086 position:35% line:89% align:start
(laughing)

00:20:45.166 --> 00:20:49.437 position:10% line:89% align:start
- Mattis, one day I'll catch

00:20:49.470 --> 00:20:51.607 position:30% line:83% align:start
and tame a wild
horse all by myself,

00:20:51.640 --> 00:20:54.743 position:10% line:89% align:start
just like you did at my age.

00:20:54.776 --> 00:20:59.080 position:10% line:83% align:start
- Yes, but you'll have to be
really fast and strong enough.

00:21:00.549 --> 00:21:01.650 position:41% line:89% align:start
- I am!

00:21:01.683 --> 00:21:04.786 position:24% line:83% align:start
I am strong enough,
you'll see I can.

00:21:04.820 --> 00:21:08.289 position:21% line:83% align:start
- [Mattis] (laughing)
Ronja, I'll bet you can do

00:21:08.322 --> 00:21:10.726 position:24% line:89% align:start
anything you want.

00:21:30.144 --> 00:21:32.413 position:13% line:89% align:start
- No animals in the forest.

00:21:33.549 --> 00:21:36.150 position:16% line:89% align:start
So where have they gone?

00:21:36.183 --> 00:21:37.686 position:21% line:89% align:start
It's eerie and quiet.

00:21:39.287 --> 00:21:43.357 position:21% line:83% align:start
Even that boy, where
is the dirty devil?

00:21:43.391 --> 00:21:46.460 position:30% line:89% align:start
- Gray dwarves.

00:21:47.696 --> 00:21:52.133 position:19% line:89% align:start
Human here, human here.

00:21:52.166 --> 00:21:53.569 position:38% line:89% align:start
(hissing)

00:21:53.602 --> 00:21:54.803 position:35% line:89% align:start
(giggling)

00:21:54.836 --> 00:21:56.772 position:16% line:89% align:start
- Gray dwarves, run away!

00:22:04.746 --> 00:22:07.448 position:33% line:89% align:start
(light music)

00:22:15.891 --> 00:22:18.192 position:38% line:89% align:start
(grunts)

00:22:56.597 --> 00:22:57.899 position:33% line:83% align:start
- [Narrator]
Throughout the autumn,

00:22:57.933 --> 00:23:00.601 position:10% line:89% align:start
not once did Ronja see Birk.

00:23:00.636 --> 00:23:03.237 position:27% line:83% align:start
Of course she was
pleased about that.

00:23:03.270 --> 00:23:04.773 position:27% line:89% align:start
(harp strumming)

00:23:04.806 --> 00:23:06.207 position:47% line:89% align:start
Or?

00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:07.241 position:30% line:89% align:start
- I don't know.

00:23:07.274 --> 00:23:08.710 position:24% line:89% align:start
I should be happy.

00:23:10.511 --> 00:23:15.182 position:13% line:83% align:start
- [Narrator] Sometimes she
simply didn't know how she felt.

00:23:15.216 --> 00:23:17.653 position:33% line:89% align:start
(harp strums)

Next time on Ronja,
the Robber's Daughter.

"Stuck in the Snow".

Don't miss it!
