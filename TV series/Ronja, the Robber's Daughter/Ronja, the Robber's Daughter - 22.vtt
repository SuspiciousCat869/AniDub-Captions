- I'm not his child.

00:01:37.455 --> 00:01:40.024 position:24% line:83% align:start
He says so himself,
so he's not my father.

00:01:40.058 --> 00:01:42.060 position:38% line:89% align:start
(crying)

00:01:42.093 --> 00:01:43.961 position:19% line:83% align:start
- [Narrator] Ronja was
thrilled to see Lill-Klippen

00:01:43.995 --> 00:01:47.499 position:13% line:83% align:start
at the bear's cave, but no
matter how much he pleaded,

00:01:47.533 --> 00:01:50.602 position:5% line:89% align:start
she refused to go home with him.

00:01:50.636 --> 00:01:53.871 position:13% line:83% align:start
Then, in the warm afternoon
whilst playing in the river,

00:01:53.905 --> 00:01:55.574 position:19% line:89% align:start
wild harpies attacked.

00:01:56.642 --> 00:01:59.445 position:24% line:83% align:start
Ronja and Birk made
a narrow escape,

00:01:59.478 --> 00:02:01.913 position:21% line:83% align:start
but they had floated
too far down,

00:02:01.946 --> 00:02:05.584 position:10% line:83% align:start
and were being dragged toward
the perilous, greedy falls.

00:02:07.653 --> 00:02:12.624 position:19% line:83% align:start
- [Harpy] Where is the
lovely human with black hair?

00:02:12.658 --> 00:02:17.029 position:13% line:89% align:start
Ah, now the blood will run.

00:02:17.062 --> 00:02:20.299 position:19% line:89% align:start
(water loudly flowing)

00:02:59.339 --> 00:03:01.241 position:33% line:89% align:start
(crying out)

00:03:01.274 --> 00:03:03.643 position:35% line:89% align:start
(grunting)

00:03:03.676 --> 00:03:07.012 position:19% line:89% align:start
(dramatic piano music)

00:03:12.452 --> 00:03:13.620 position:38% line:89% align:start
- Ronja!

00:03:13.653 --> 00:03:15.021 position:27% line:89% align:start
We've got to try!

00:03:16.756 --> 00:03:19.025 position:35% line:89% align:start
(grunting)

00:03:24.765 --> 00:03:28.168 position:16% line:89% align:start
(water loudly cascading)

00:03:37.243 --> 00:03:40.079 position:27% line:89% align:start
(gasping for air)

00:03:51.592 --> 00:03:54.595 position:24% line:89% align:start
(breathing heavily)

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:00.301 position:41% line:89% align:start
Ronja!

00:04:14.548 --> 00:04:15.382 position:41% line:89% align:start
Ronja!

00:04:19.353 --> 00:04:22.756 position:16% line:89% align:start
(water loudly cascading)

00:04:33.768 --> 00:04:37.071 position:21% line:89% align:start
Finally, we made it.

00:04:37.104 --> 00:04:42.309 position:19% line:83% align:start
Couldn't take any more,
just breathe, breathe.

00:04:42.343 --> 00:04:44.245 position:30% line:89% align:start
Keep breathing.

00:04:44.278 --> 00:04:47.314 position:21% line:89% align:start
(harpies screeching)

00:05:06.635 --> 00:05:09.571 position:24% line:89% align:start
(breathing deeply)

00:05:40.168 --> 00:05:43.171 position:27% line:89% align:start
(birds squawking)

00:05:59.188 --> 00:06:01.624 position:33% line:89% align:start
(quiet gasp)

00:06:03.926 --> 00:06:06.495 position:33% line:89% align:start
(quiet gasp)

00:06:14.604 --> 00:06:15.872 position:24% line:89% align:start
- Ah, you're back.

00:06:15.906 --> 00:06:17.673 position:10% line:89% align:start
Have you both been swimming?

00:06:17.707 --> 00:06:21.410 position:30% line:83% align:start
You're all wet,
and you look tired.

00:06:28.852 --> 00:06:30.353 position:41% line:89% align:start
- Yes.

00:06:30.386 --> 00:06:31.788 position:33% line:89% align:start
That's right.

00:06:31.822 --> 00:06:33.924 position:19% line:89% align:start
We were having a swim.

00:06:33.957 --> 00:06:35.859 position:13% line:89% align:start
Birk and I, down at the...

00:06:37.694 --> 00:06:39.261 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hey!

00:06:39.295 --> 00:06:42.799 position:24% line:83% align:start
Aren't you going to
say hello to my mother?

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:46.235 position:13% line:89% align:start
- Say hello to your mother?

00:06:46.268 --> 00:06:48.739 position:30% line:83% align:start
I don't welcome
uninvited guests.

00:06:48.772 --> 00:06:50.507 position:33% line:89% align:start
(quiet gasp)

00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:52.409 position:21% line:83% align:start
That's what I learned
from my mother

00:06:52.442 --> 00:06:54.176 position:10% line:89% align:start
when I was just a little boy.

00:06:54.211 --> 00:06:57.614 position:19% line:83% align:start
Unwelcomed guests bring
nothing but trouble.

00:07:02.519 --> 00:07:05.188 position:16% line:83% align:start
- It's a pity your mother
didn't decide to teach you

00:07:05.222 --> 00:07:06.923 position:21% line:89% align:start
some manners as well.

00:07:26.443 --> 00:07:29.647 position:10% line:89% align:start
Birk is very tired right now.

00:07:29.681 --> 00:07:30.447 position:38% line:89% align:start
Come in.

00:07:34.986 --> 00:07:37.287 position:38% line:89% align:start
(crying)

00:07:41.426 --> 00:07:44.929 position:16% line:89% align:start
(sentimental piano music)

00:07:47.365 --> 00:07:51.201 position:19% line:83% align:start
- You do know why I've
come, don't you, Ronja?

00:07:53.404 --> 00:07:56.641 position:21% line:83% align:start
- It wasn't to bring
me more bread, no?

00:07:58.276 --> 00:07:58.943 position:44% line:89% align:start
- No.

00:08:00.578 --> 00:08:04.348 position:13% line:83% align:start
There'll be plenty of bread
for you when you come home.

00:08:09.721 --> 00:08:11.322 position:38% line:89% align:start
(crying)

00:08:11.355 --> 00:08:13.926 position:7% line:89% align:start
- I'll never come home, never!

00:08:13.959 --> 00:08:14.893 position:33% line:89% align:start
Never never!

00:08:15.928 --> 00:08:16.761 position:41% line:89% align:start
Never!

00:08:17.930 --> 00:08:20.966 position:27% line:83% align:start
- Well, this can
only end one way,

00:08:20.999 --> 00:08:23.702 position:24% line:83% align:start
with Mattis jumping
in the river.

00:08:25.470 --> 00:08:29.007 position:13% line:83% align:start
- Mattis wouldn't do that,
throwing himself for my sake.

00:08:29.041 --> 00:08:31.409 position:27% line:83% align:start
He wouldn't even
mention my name.

00:08:31.442 --> 00:08:33.779 position:21% line:89% align:start
Lill-Klippen told me.

00:08:33.812 --> 00:08:38.316 position:13% line:83% align:start
- He won't allow anyone to
mention your name anymore.

00:08:38.349 --> 00:08:42.320 position:21% line:83% align:start
And yet, every night
he cries in his sleep

00:08:42.353 --> 00:08:43.756 position:21% line:89% align:start
and calls your name.

00:08:43.789 --> 00:08:46.792 position:13% line:89% align:start
Every night since you left.

00:08:46.825 --> 00:08:48.560 position:19% line:89% align:start
- But how do you know?

00:08:49.962 --> 00:08:53.966 position:7% line:83% align:start
Have you got him back sleeping
in your bed once again?

00:08:53.999 --> 00:08:57.503 position:19% line:83% align:start
Is he not sleeping with
Noddle-Pete anymore?

00:08:57.536 --> 00:08:59.371 position:30% line:89% align:start
- That's right.

00:08:59.404 --> 00:09:03.042 position:13% line:83% align:start
Noddle-Pete couldn't stand
having him sleep in there.

00:09:03.076 --> 00:09:05.277 position:10% line:89% align:start
He couldn't bear it anymore.

00:09:06.445 --> 00:09:08.680 position:27% line:83% align:start
All day he looks
to fight everyone.

00:09:08.714 --> 00:09:11.383 position:24% line:83% align:start
At night he battles
with himself.

00:09:12.919 --> 00:09:16.856 position:13% line:83% align:start
But your poor father has to
have someone to hang on to

00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:18.490 position:21% line:89% align:start
when things get bad.

00:09:21.460 --> 00:09:25.098 position:24% line:83% align:start
Oh, you know Ronja,
it's hard to see someone

00:09:25.131 --> 00:09:29.434 position:13% line:83% align:start
keep tormenting themself so
harshly when you love them.

00:09:36.075 --> 00:09:41.114 position:30% line:83% align:start
- But Lovis, if
you were a child,

00:09:41.147 --> 00:09:45.418 position:13% line:83% align:start
and had a father who denied
you, denied you so completely

00:09:45.451 --> 00:09:47.954 position:27% line:83% align:start
that he couldn't
even say your name,

00:09:49.622 --> 00:09:52.725 position:10% line:83% align:start
wouldn't you want to get away
from him as far as possible?

00:09:52.759 --> 00:09:56.696 position:19% line:83% align:start
Wouldn't living in the
forest be so much better?

00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:04.938 position:19% line:83% align:start
If it were your father,
would you go back to him,

00:10:04.971 --> 00:10:06.806 position:19% line:89% align:start
if he hadn't asked you?

00:10:11.444 --> 00:10:15.582 position:27% line:83% align:start
- No, I certainly
couldn't go back to him.

00:10:18.718 --> 00:10:21.956 position:21% line:83% align:start
If he wanted me home
he would have to say,

00:10:21.989 --> 00:10:24.524 position:7% line:89% align:start
"I'm begging you to come back."

00:10:25.626 --> 00:10:28.729 position:7% line:89% align:start
Yes, and he would have to ask.

00:10:28.762 --> 00:10:29.663 position:38% line:89% align:start
- Really?

00:10:29.697 --> 00:10:31.497 position:10% line:89% align:start
Mattis would never say that.

00:10:31.532 --> 00:10:33.466 position:16% line:89% align:start
You know what he's like!

00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:35.502 position:38% line:89% align:start
(crying)

00:10:44.011 --> 00:10:46.113 position:38% line:89% align:start
(crying)

00:11:02.930 --> 00:11:05.133 position:13% line:89% align:start
- Ronja, it's time for bed.

00:11:07.202 --> 00:11:10.471 position:19% line:83% align:start
I'll wait here and try
and get some sleep,

00:11:10.504 --> 00:11:12.140 position:19% line:89% align:start
until the dawn arrives.

00:11:14.242 --> 00:11:16.577 position:7% line:89% align:start
- I want to sleep in your lap,

00:11:16.610 --> 00:11:19.180 position:5% line:89% align:start
and you must sing the Wolf Song.

00:11:19.214 --> 00:11:20.048 position:35% line:89% align:start

00:13:22.105 --> 00:13:24.875 position:27% line:83% align:start
when we're alone,
when you're in trouble

00:13:24.908 --> 00:13:29.012 position:10% line:83% align:start
or you need my help, and when
it's just us two together.

00:13:31.181 --> 00:13:34.651 position:13% line:83% align:start
But when your father sends
one of his messengers,

00:13:34.684 --> 00:13:37.087 position:21% line:83% align:start
as soon as his name's
even mentioned,

00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:39.156 position:16% line:89% align:start
you stop being my sister.

00:13:40.391 --> 00:13:44.795 position:21% line:83% align:start
And so I behave like
a little coward.

00:13:45.862 --> 00:13:48.832 position:24% line:83% align:start
And that's why I'm
grieving for us.

00:13:48.865 --> 00:13:50.901 position:16% line:89% align:start
- But Birk, that's not...

00:13:55.972 --> 00:13:57.341 position:24% line:89% align:start
- But that's how...

00:13:57.375 --> 00:14:00.078 position:16% line:89% align:start
That's how it has to be.

00:14:00.111 --> 00:14:01.611 position:24% line:89% align:start
I realize that now.

00:14:03.948 --> 00:14:06.150 position:10% line:89% align:start
- Even so, nothing's changed.

00:14:06.184 --> 00:14:08.785 position:5% line:89% align:start
You still want to be my brother.

00:14:08.819 --> 00:14:10.587 position:19% line:89% align:start
- Yes, of course I do.

00:14:12.890 --> 00:14:14.892 position:5% line:89% align:start
You know I'm brother completely.

00:14:14.926 --> 00:14:16.260 position:27% line:89% align:start
I always will be.

00:14:21.833 --> 00:14:24.368 position:27% line:89% align:start
(drinking water)

00:14:26.404 --> 00:14:31.776 position:21% line:83% align:start
So now know, I really
wanted us somewhere alone,

00:14:31.809 --> 00:14:34.679 position:13% line:83% align:start
without anyone from Mattis'
fort getting in the way

00:14:34.712 --> 00:14:36.415 position:24% line:89% align:start
of our lives here.

00:14:36.448 --> 00:14:39.384 position:10% line:83% align:start
And that's why I cannot bear
to talk about what happens

00:14:39.418 --> 00:14:40.751 position:19% line:89% align:start
when the winter comes.

00:14:40.785 --> 00:14:41.986 position:41% line:89% align:start
- Why?

00:14:42.019 --> 00:14:43.255 position:33% line:89% align:start
Tell me why.

00:14:46.924 --> 00:14:50.195 position:21% line:83% align:start
- Because it's summer
now, sister mine.

00:14:52.131 --> 00:14:55.766 position:13% line:83% align:start
And we only have this time
with each other, me and you.

00:14:55.800 --> 00:14:58.403 position:5% line:89% align:start
We must make the most of it, eh?

00:15:01.340 --> 00:15:03.741 position:21% line:83% align:start
Before winter comes,
you must go back

00:15:03.774 --> 00:15:05.643 position:19% line:89% align:start
to Mattis' fort, Ronja.

00:15:06.445 --> 00:15:07.279 position:35% line:89% align:start
- And you?

00:15:08.947 --> 00:15:12.985 position:10% line:83% align:start
- I could go, and try to beg
my way back into Borka's Keep.

00:15:13.018 --> 00:15:15.686 position:33% line:83% align:start
I wouldn't be
drive away, I know.

00:15:15.721 --> 00:15:17.890 position:10% line:89% align:start
But what good would that do?

00:15:17.923 --> 00:15:21.426 position:13% line:89% align:start
(peaceful orchestra music)

00:15:27.266 --> 00:15:30.836 position:16% line:83% align:start
Then I'd be left without
you and we'd be kept apart.

00:15:30.869 --> 00:15:34.474 position:33% line:83% align:start
I wouldn't be
allowed to see you.

00:15:34.507 --> 00:15:36.875 position:16% line:89% align:start
- You'll freeze to death.

00:15:36.909 --> 00:15:39.077 position:35% line:89% align:start
(laughing)

00:15:42.848 --> 00:15:44.284 position:19% line:89% align:start
- Perhaps you're right.

00:15:44.317 --> 00:15:47.019 position:33% line:83% align:start
Or maybe I'll
survive the winter.

00:15:47.052 --> 00:15:49.721 position:7% line:83% align:start
- But if it's like last winter,
and the forest is covered

00:15:49.755 --> 00:15:53.426 position:19% line:83% align:start
in snow and freezing, I
wouldn't be able to bring you

00:15:53.459 --> 00:15:56.795 position:19% line:83% align:start
any bread or a warm fur
coat, and you'd be out here

00:15:56.828 --> 00:16:00.033 position:24% line:83% align:start
by yourself, no one
to look out for you.

00:16:00.066 --> 00:16:02.468 position:5% line:89% align:start
I am telling you, Birk Borkason.

00:16:04.537 --> 00:16:08.808 position:19% line:83% align:start
- Well, I guess that's
how it will have to be.

00:16:08.841 --> 00:16:12.178 position:21% line:83% align:start
But look, it's summer
now, so don't be sad.

00:16:13.546 --> 00:16:16.249 position:27% line:83% align:start
- I don't care if
it's summer or winter,

00:16:16.282 --> 00:16:19.085 position:21% line:83% align:start
who said I was going
back to Mattis?

00:16:19.118 --> 00:16:21.454 position:21% line:89% align:start
I'm staying with you.

00:16:21.487 --> 00:16:23.189 position:16% line:89% align:start
- No, you're going home.

00:16:23.223 --> 00:16:27.528 position:19% line:83% align:start
Even if I end up having
to carry you there myself.

00:16:27.561 --> 00:16:29.829 position:5% line:89% align:start
If the worst comes to the worst,

00:16:29.862 --> 00:16:33.534 position:27% line:83% align:start
I plan to freeze
to death on my own.

00:16:33.567 --> 00:16:36.069 position:10% line:89% align:start
But our summer is right now.

00:16:36.102 --> 00:16:37.303 position:30% line:89% align:start
Let's enjoy it.

00:16:38.572 --> 00:16:41.941 position:21% line:89% align:start
(peaceful harp music)

00:16:50.217 --> 00:16:53.053 position:27% line:89% align:start
(water splashing)

00:16:57.491 --> 00:16:58.559 position:41% line:89% align:start
Great!

00:16:58.592 --> 00:17:00.827 position:30% line:83% align:start
I can't believe
how lucky we are.

00:17:00.860 --> 00:17:02.062 position:41% line:89% align:start
- Yes.

00:17:02.096 --> 00:17:04.865 position:21% line:83% align:start
I figured today would
be the day they came

00:17:04.898 --> 00:17:07.134 position:19% line:89% align:start
and started puffing up.

00:17:07.167 --> 00:17:09.303 position:13% line:89% align:start
- Come on Ronja, let's go.

00:17:09.336 --> 00:17:11.505 position:10% line:89% align:start
I can't wait, I'm so hungry.

00:17:11.538 --> 00:17:12.306 position:38% line:89% align:start
- Me too!

00:17:14.208 --> 00:17:18.379 position:27% line:83% align:start
(peaceful guitar
and piano music)

00:17:27.154 --> 00:17:29.423 position:35% line:89% align:start
(laughing)

00:17:30.592 --> 00:17:33.561 position:35% line:89% align:start
(laughing)

00:17:33.595 --> 00:17:35.530 position:41% line:89% align:start
(grunt)

00:17:36.564 --> 00:17:37.798 position:41% line:89% align:start
An elk!

00:17:47.175 --> 00:17:50.111 position:24% line:89% align:start
(harpy screeching)

00:18:00.255 --> 00:18:02.524 position:35% line:89% align:start
(laughing)

00:18:04.459 --> 00:18:07.395 position:24% line:89% align:start
(horses galloping)

00:18:29.518 --> 00:18:31.587 position:35% line:89% align:start
(grunting)

00:18:44.467 --> 00:18:46.502 position:19% line:89% align:start
- Let's make a promise.

00:18:46.535 --> 00:18:50.473 position:16% line:83% align:start
We won't let anyone spoil
the time we have left.

00:18:58.114 --> 00:18:59.682 position:33% line:89% align:start
- I love it!

00:18:59.715 --> 00:19:04.019 position:10% line:83% align:start
I'm taking in the summer like
a bee gathering up nectar.

00:19:07.156 --> 00:19:11.560 position:16% line:83% align:start
Gathering it all together
in a big lump of summer

00:19:11.594 --> 00:19:13.362 position:19% line:89% align:start
to live on, to live on

00:19:14.597 --> 00:19:19.468 position:33% line:83% align:start
when it's not
summertime anymore.

00:19:24.541 --> 00:19:26.942 position:16% line:83% align:start
Brother, do you know the
ingredients that make

00:19:26.976 --> 00:19:29.078 position:13% line:89% align:start
this great summer banquet?

00:19:32.248 --> 00:19:35.184 position:19% line:83% align:start
It's a whole mixture of
things, like blueberry bushes

00:19:35.217 --> 00:19:40.490 position:10% line:83% align:start
and trees covered with fruit,
and sunrises over the river,

00:19:40.524 --> 00:19:42.659 position:21% line:83% align:start
and the freckles that
you have on your arms,

00:19:42.692 --> 00:19:46.962 position:13% line:83% align:start
and the moonlight over the
mountains and the starry skies,

00:19:46.996 --> 00:19:50.100 position:7% line:89% align:start
the noonday heat in the woods,

00:19:50.133 --> 00:19:53.537 position:19% line:83% align:start
when the sun is shining
on the great fir trees,

00:19:53.570 --> 00:19:56.006 position:16% line:83% align:start
and the light rain in the
evening, and squirrels

00:19:56.039 --> 00:20:02.245 position:7% line:83% align:start
and foxes and hares and elk and
all the wild horses we know.

00:20:02.279 --> 00:20:07.317 position:7% line:83% align:start
And we would swim and we would
ride into the woods and...

00:20:07.350 --> 00:20:09.986 position:10% line:89% align:start
Oh well, you know, don't you?

00:20:12.189 --> 00:20:14.692 position:24% line:83% align:start
- That would be the
greatest summer banquet.

00:20:14.725 --> 00:20:17.260 position:7% line:89% align:start
Only my sister could create it.

00:20:36.380 --> 00:20:39.115 position:27% line:89% align:start

grew crisp, cooler.

00:20:50.495 --> 00:20:53.030 position:7% line:89% align:start

(quiet gasp)

00:21:26.565 --> 00:21:27.399 position:38% line:89% align:start
- Ronja!

00:21:30.134 --> 00:21:31.168 position:30% line:89% align:start
- What's wrong?

00:21:33.639 --> 00:21:37.108 position:10% line:89% align:start
You're not afraid of the fog?

00:21:37.141 --> 00:21:41.045 position:13% line:83% align:start
Do you think that after all
this time we'll get lost?

(girls singing)
(quiet gasp)

00:21:52.591 --> 00:21:53.792 position:33% line:89% align:start
Do you hear?

00:21:53.825 --> 00:21:58.163 position:10% line:83% align:start
It's them, it's the unearthly
ones with their siren song.

00:21:58.196 --> 00:22:01.266 position:24% line:83% align:start
Oh, at last, I can
hear them for myself.

00:22:02.768 --> 00:22:06.806 position:16% line:83% align:start
- But, don't you remember
hearing that song before?

00:22:06.839 --> 00:22:09.575 position:13% line:89% align:start
- No, I've never heard it.

00:22:09.608 --> 00:22:12.611 position:21% line:83% align:start
They sing their evil
songs to try and lure us

00:22:12.645 --> 00:22:14.513 position:19% line:89% align:start
down to the underworld.

00:22:14.546 --> 00:22:15.314 position:38% line:89% align:start
They do.

00:22:16.315 --> 00:22:17.416 position:30% line:89% align:start
- Yes, they do.

00:22:18.818 --> 00:22:23.155 position:13% line:83% align:start
Ronja, please don't tell me
you'd like to follow them.

00:22:23.188 --> 00:22:26.224 position:35% line:89% align:start
(laughing)

00:22:26.258 --> 00:22:29.362 position:27% line:83% align:start
- You're mad, why
would anyone do that?

00:22:29.395 --> 00:22:32.097 position:7% line:89% align:start
Because Noddle-Pete, he said...

00:22:35.868 --> 00:22:37.637 position:24% line:89% align:start
- Noddle-Pete what?

00:22:37.670 --> 00:22:39.137 position:27% line:89% align:start
What did he say?

00:22:42.175 --> 00:22:44.277 position:21% line:89% align:start
- It doesn't matter.

00:22:44.310 --> 00:22:47.113 position:30% line:89% align:start
(girls singing)

00:22:53.720 --> 00:22:58.892 position:16% line:83% align:start

come into the forest and sing,

00:22:58.926 --> 00:23:01.461 position:19% line:89% align:start
you know it is autumn.

00:23:02.729 --> 00:23:04.898 position:35% line:89% align:start
(laughing)

00:23:07.567 --> 00:23:13.841 position:16% line:83% align:start
And then, soon, winter'll
come rushing over.

00:23:13.874 --> 00:23:17.911 position:27% line:89% align:start
Oh dear me, yes.
