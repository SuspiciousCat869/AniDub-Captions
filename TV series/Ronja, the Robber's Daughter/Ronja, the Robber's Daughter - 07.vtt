(uptempo music)

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:45.852 position:21% line:83% align:start
- Borka wants to talk
to me, is that so?

00:01:45.886 --> 00:01:47.322 position:19% line:83% align:start
- [Narrator] Borka and
his robbers moved into

00:01:47.355 --> 00:01:49.290 position:7% line:89% align:start
the north side of Mattis' fort

00:01:49.324 --> 00:01:51.993 position:13% line:89% align:start
without asking permission.

00:01:52.026 --> 00:01:55.030 position:21% line:83% align:start
They settled into the
other side of Hell's Gap.

00:01:55.064 --> 00:01:56.899 position:30% line:83% align:start
Mattis and his
robbers went up to try

00:01:56.932 --> 00:02:00.002 position:19% line:83% align:start
and chase them off, but
they wouldn't budge.

00:02:00.035 --> 00:02:02.372 position:7% line:89% align:start
Mattis was terribly frustrated.

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:08.112 position:16% line:83% align:start
And in the forest, Ronja
had problems of her own.

00:02:25.832 --> 00:02:27.968 position:38% line:89% align:start
(giggles)

00:02:28.002 --> 00:02:28.769 position:41% line:89% align:start
- Mmmm.

00:02:30.472 --> 00:02:31.306 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmpf.

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:34.477 position:35% line:89% align:start
(footsteps)

00:02:36.312 --> 00:02:39.982 position:24% line:83% align:start
- Are you really in
that much of a hurry?

00:02:40.016 --> 00:02:41.518 position:7% line:89% align:start
- Who said that I'm in a hurry?

00:02:41.551 --> 00:02:43.920 position:24% line:83% align:start
And it's nothing to
do with you, anyway.

00:02:43.954 --> 00:02:44.521 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh.

00:02:47.224 --> 00:02:48.058 position:41% line:89% align:start
- Hmm.

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:51.896 position:35% line:89% align:start
(footsteps)

00:03:00.873 --> 00:03:03.843 position:24% line:89% align:start
(breathing heavily)

00:03:08.916 --> 00:03:10.918 position:41% line:89% align:start
(sighs)

00:03:12.287 --> 00:03:14.222 position:7% line:89% align:start
- That good-for-nothing rascal.

00:03:14.256 --> 00:03:16.492 position:7% line:89% align:start
What is he doing in my forest?

00:03:16.526 --> 00:03:18.428 position:24% line:89% align:start
I'll go and check.

00:03:18.461 --> 00:03:21.064 position:30% line:89% align:start
(playful music)

00:03:50.531 --> 00:03:52.601 position:35% line:89% align:start
(rustling)

00:03:58.575 --> 00:03:59.409 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:04:02.345 --> 00:04:04.948 position:30% line:89% align:start
(playful music)

00:04:13.358 --> 00:04:15.527 position:38% line:89% align:start
(giggles)

00:04:24.103 --> 00:04:26.640 position:27% line:89% align:start
(kits grumbling)

00:04:53.605 --> 00:04:56.408 position:24% line:83% align:start
- What do you want,
robber's daughter?

00:04:56.442 --> 00:04:57.209 position:41% line:89% align:start
- Huh?

00:04:58.478 --> 00:05:00.647 position:38% line:89% align:start
(giggles)

00:05:04.552 --> 00:05:06.287 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmpf.

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:09.023 position:16% line:83% align:start
Well, it appears you are
a Borka Robber after all.

00:05:09.056 --> 00:05:10.391 position:19% line:83% align:start
And you really thought
you could steal

00:05:10.424 --> 00:05:12.594 position:13% line:89% align:start
my fox cubs from my forest?

00:05:13.695 --> 00:05:14.729 position:10% line:89% align:start
- We're not the only ones who

00:05:14.764 --> 00:05:17.098 position:13% line:89% align:start
take things without asking.

00:05:17.132 --> 00:05:19.302 position:13% line:89% align:start
Mattis' robbers do it, too.

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:22.271 position:44% line:89% align:start
- Hm?

00:05:22.305 --> 00:05:26.109 position:16% line:83% align:start
Anyhow, leave my fox cubs
alone, understand me?

00:05:26.143 --> 00:05:28.713 position:27% line:83% align:start
Why don't you get
out of my woods?

00:05:31.583 --> 00:05:32.617 position:47% line:89% align:start
Hm.

00:05:40.426 --> 00:05:42.127 position:27% line:89% align:start
- Your fox cubs?

00:05:42.161 --> 00:05:43.663 position:35% line:89% align:start
Your woods?

00:05:43.697 --> 00:05:46.467 position:24% line:83% align:start
Fox cubs belong to
no one, understand?

00:05:46.501 --> 00:05:48.168 position:13% line:89% align:start
They belong to themselves.

00:05:48.202 --> 00:05:48.769 position:47% line:89% align:start
Hm.

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:56.512 position:24% line:83% align:start
The forest doesn't
belong to people.

00:05:56.545 --> 00:05:58.146 position:13% line:89% align:start
You don't own these woods.

00:05:58.180 --> 00:05:59.749 position:30% line:89% align:start
The animals do.

00:05:59.782 --> 00:06:01.484 position:24% line:89% align:start
And that's not all.

00:06:01.518 --> 00:06:04.254 position:24% line:83% align:start
This is the wolves'
and bears' and elks'

00:06:04.287 --> 00:06:06.790 position:10% line:89% align:start
and wild horses' woods, too.

00:06:06.824 --> 00:06:09.593 position:10% line:89% align:start
And the owls' and the hawks'

00:06:09.628 --> 00:06:11.796 position:27% line:83% align:start
and the cuckoos'
wood and the snails'

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:14.666 position:27% line:83% align:start
and the spiders'
and the ants' wood.

00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:20.473 position:19% line:83% align:start
- I know every animal,
every creature,

00:06:20.506 --> 00:06:23.209 position:24% line:83% align:start
so don't go trying
to teach me anything.

00:06:23.242 --> 00:06:23.810 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmpf.

00:06:24.711 --> 00:06:27.414 position:10% line:89% align:start
- So, you know, the Harpies?

00:06:27.447 --> 00:06:28.516 position:27% line:89% align:start
The Great Wolves?

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:29.717 position:27% line:89% align:start
The Merk Trolls?

00:06:29.751 --> 00:06:30.852 position:19% line:89% align:start
They're all out there.

00:06:30.885 --> 00:06:32.755 position:21% line:89% align:start
It's their wood, too.

00:06:32.788 --> 00:06:35.658 position:24% line:83% align:start
Not to mention the
unearthly ones.

00:06:35.691 --> 00:06:38.627 position:24% line:83% align:start
- You think you're
so smart, don't you?

00:06:38.661 --> 00:06:42.399 position:21% line:83% align:start
Why don't you tell me
something I don't know.

00:06:42.432 --> 00:06:43.733 position:24% line:89% align:start
Otherwise, shut up.

00:06:44.902 --> 00:06:48.773 position:24% line:83% align:start
- Mmm, no, because
it's not your forest.

00:06:48.806 --> 00:06:51.342 position:7% line:89% align:start
The forest belongs to everyone,

00:06:51.375 --> 00:06:52.410 position:33% line:89% align:start
including me!

00:06:57.784 --> 00:06:58.751 position:41% line:89% align:start
- Hmpf.

00:06:58.785 --> 00:07:01.154 position:7% line:89% align:start
- And if you think it's yours,

00:07:01.187 --> 00:07:03.556 position:24% line:83% align:start
robber's daughter,
if you really think

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:06.125 position:5% line:89% align:start
you can keep it all to yourself,

00:07:07.661 --> 00:07:09.530 position:21% line:89% align:start
then you are stupid.

00:07:12.367 --> 00:07:14.736 position:27% line:83% align:start
- Well, you see,
I'm happy to share

00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:16.639 position:21% line:89% align:start
with all the animals.

00:07:16.672 --> 00:07:18.708 position:16% line:89% align:start
Foxes, owls, all of them.

00:07:19.642 --> 00:07:21.778 position:5% line:89% align:start
All of the animals here but you!

00:07:21.812 --> 00:07:22.779 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmm.

00:07:24.848 --> 00:07:27.384 position:35% line:89% align:start
(footsteps)

00:07:34.793 --> 00:07:37.730 position:27% line:89% align:start
(wind whooshing)

00:08:02.659 --> 00:08:03.761 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:08:03.794 --> 00:08:04.728 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmm.

00:08:06.363 --> 00:08:07.197 position:38% line:89% align:start
- Ronja?

00:08:11.268 --> 00:08:12.270 position:33% line:89% align:start
Wait for me.

00:08:14.807 --> 00:08:15.641 position:41% line:89% align:start
- Ugh.

00:08:17.777 --> 00:08:19.645 position:30% line:89% align:start
- [Birk] Ronja?

00:08:19.679 --> 00:08:21.180 position:24% line:89% align:start
- What do you want?

00:08:26.353 --> 00:08:27.889 position:33% line:89% align:start
- This mist.

00:08:27.922 --> 00:08:31.759 position:21% line:83% align:start
Don't you think it's
a little bit scary?

00:08:31.793 --> 00:08:33.227 position:38% line:89% align:start
- Do you?

00:08:33.261 --> 00:08:34.462 position:21% line:83% align:start
You're not frightened
that you can't

00:08:34.496 --> 00:08:35.898 position:7% line:89% align:start
find your way back to the home

00:08:35.931 --> 00:08:38.935 position:21% line:83% align:start
that you and all your
thieving family broke into?

00:08:38.968 --> 00:08:42.572 position:19% line:83% align:start
Maybe you should share
the foxes' lair with them?

00:08:42.605 --> 00:08:45.608 position:27% line:83% align:start
After all, you're
so fond of sharing.

00:08:47.277 --> 00:08:49.447 position:38% line:89% align:start
(giggles)

00:08:52.851 --> 00:08:54.286 position:24% line:83% align:start
- You've got a head
hotter than rock,

00:08:54.319 --> 00:08:57.957 position:24% line:83% align:start
robber's daughter,
like your father.

00:08:57.990 --> 00:08:59.025 position:7% line:89% align:start
But you can find your way home

00:08:59.058 --> 00:08:59.992 position:24% line:89% align:start
better than I will.

00:09:00.026 --> 00:09:03.563 position:19% line:83% align:start
And this mist is movin'
in really quickly.

00:09:03.596 --> 00:09:05.966 position:16% line:83% align:start
Do you mind if I hold on
to the edge of your tunic

00:09:05.999 --> 00:09:08.469 position:27% line:83% align:start
'til we're safely
out of the woods?

00:09:08.502 --> 00:09:12.607 position:35% line:83% align:start
(footsteps)
(wind whooshing)

00:09:13.976 --> 00:09:14.810 position:44% line:89% align:start
Oop.

00:09:20.316 --> 00:09:21.785 position:41% line:89% align:start
- Here.

00:09:21.818 --> 00:09:24.454 position:16% line:83% align:start
Hold on to this but keep
a rope's length away.

00:09:24.488 --> 00:09:26.924 position:7% line:89% align:start
I'm warning you, don't let go.

00:09:28.526 --> 00:09:29.961 position:35% line:89% align:start
(chuckles)

00:09:29.994 --> 00:09:32.898 position:21% line:83% align:start
- As you wish, angry
robber's daughter.

00:09:32.931 --> 00:09:33.699 position:41% line:89% align:start
- Hmpf.

00:09:34.867 --> 00:09:39.038 position:35% line:83% align:start
(footsteps)
(wind whooshing)

00:09:49.517 --> 00:09:51.987 position:30% line:89% align:start
(ominous music)

00:10:35.871 --> 00:10:36.705 position:44% line:89% align:start
Good.

00:10:59.799 --> 00:11:00.633 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:11:04.738 --> 00:11:07.007 position:5% line:89% align:start
- Hmm, do you know where we are?

00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:09.110 position:21% line:89% align:start
- The signpost rock.

00:11:09.143 --> 00:11:11.079 position:16% line:89% align:start
We're on the right path.

00:11:12.180 --> 00:11:16.552 position:27% line:83% align:start
(wind whooshing)
(footsteps)

00:11:39.846 --> 00:11:41.848 position:41% line:89% align:start
(gasps)

00:11:46.587 --> 00:11:47.187 position:38% line:89% align:start
But how?

00:11:48.555 --> 00:11:49.925 position:27% line:83% align:start
Have we just been
going 'round in circles

00:11:49.958 --> 00:11:51.059 position:30% line:89% align:start
all this time?

00:11:54.996 --> 00:11:57.033 position:35% line:89% align:start
(giggling)

00:12:04.274 --> 00:12:05.108 position:47% line:89% align:start
Ah.

00:12:08.046 --> 00:12:10.915 position:30% line:89% align:start
(ominous music)

00:12:14.585 --> 00:12:16.622 position:27% line:89% align:start
I'll be alright.

00:12:16.655 --> 00:12:18.924 position:24% line:89% align:start
I'll be home soon,

00:12:18.958 --> 00:12:22.228 position:21% line:83% align:start
then I'll hear Lovis
sing the wolf song.

00:12:22.262 --> 00:12:23.029 position:44% line:89% align:start
Birk?

00:12:24.864 --> 00:12:25.699 position:44% line:89% align:start
Birk?

00:12:30.205 --> 00:12:31.038 position:44% line:89% align:start
Birk?

00:12:32.673 --> 00:12:35.210 position:27% line:89% align:start
(wind whooshing)

00:12:42.919 --> 00:12:45.055 position:35% line:89% align:start
(giggling)

00:12:45.089 --> 00:12:45.856 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:12:54.333 --> 00:12:55.167 position:47% line:89% align:start
Ah.

00:12:57.203 --> 00:12:58.037 position:47% line:89% align:start
Ah.

00:12:59.005 --> 00:13:01.074 position:35% line:89% align:start
(giggling)

00:13:09.717 --> 00:13:12.653 position:24% line:89% align:start
(children singing)

00:13:24.235 --> 00:13:26.669 position:27% line:89% align:start
They're calling.

00:13:32.743 --> 00:13:34.212 position:35% line:89% align:start
I'm coming.

00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:35.914 position:44% line:89% align:start
Wait.

00:13:44.058 --> 00:13:44.892 position:38% line:89% align:start
- Ronja!

00:13:47.194 --> 00:13:49.931 position:7% line:89% align:start
Where'd you think you're going?

00:13:49.964 --> 00:13:52.300 position:19% line:83% align:start
You mustn't follow the
unearthly ones, Ronja.

00:13:52.333 --> 00:13:54.135 position:27% line:83% align:start
If you do, you'll
be lost forever.

00:13:54.169 --> 00:13:56.105 position:16% line:89% align:start
Do you hear me, forever!

00:13:58.307 --> 00:14:01.211 position:24% line:89% align:start
(children singing)

00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:05.082 position:33% line:89% align:start
- I'm coming.

00:14:05.115 --> 00:14:05.882 position:44% line:89% align:start
Wait!

00:14:07.985 --> 00:14:08.820 position:38% line:89% align:start
- Ronja!

00:14:11.823 --> 00:14:12.824 position:33% line:89% align:start
- Let me go.

00:14:13.825 --> 00:14:16.762 position:35% line:89% align:start
(grunting)

00:14:16.795 --> 00:14:17.363 position:35% line:89% align:start
Let me go!

00:14:19.265 --> 00:14:21.034 position:35% line:89% align:start
(thudding)

00:14:21.067 --> 00:14:22.168 position:24% line:89% align:start
- Stop doing that!

00:14:22.202 --> 00:14:23.670 position:33% line:89% align:start
You can't go!

00:14:23.703 --> 00:14:24.405 position:35% line:89% align:start
(groaning)

00:14:24.438 --> 00:14:26.107 position:24% line:89% align:start
- No, please, wait!

00:14:27.141 --> 00:14:29.977 position:27% line:83% align:start
(wind whooshing)
(children singing)

00:14:30.010 --> 00:14:32.214 position:24% line:89% align:start
Yes, that's right.

00:14:32.247 --> 00:14:33.148 position:41% line:89% align:start
Coming!

00:14:33.181 --> 00:14:34.149 position:30% line:89% align:start
- You mustn't.

00:14:34.182 --> 00:14:35.418 position:33% line:89% align:start
- Let me go!

00:14:35.451 --> 00:14:37.320 position:27% line:89% align:start
I said let me go!

00:14:37.353 --> 00:14:38.121 position:35% line:89% align:start
- I won't!

00:14:39.155 --> 00:14:40.423 position:33% line:89% align:start
- Let me go!

00:14:40.456 --> 00:14:42.359 position:35% line:89% align:start
(groaning)

00:14:42.392 --> 00:14:44.294 position:21% line:89% align:start
Let me go, let me go.

00:14:44.328 --> 00:14:46.730 position:35% line:89% align:start
(groaning)

00:14:48.366 --> 00:14:50.001 position:44% line:89% align:start
- Ah!

00:14:50.034 --> 00:14:50.969 position:33% line:89% align:start
- I must go!

00:14:52.237 --> 00:14:53.071 position:44% line:89% align:start
- Ah!

00:14:55.074 --> 00:14:59.044 position:24% line:83% align:start
(breathing heavily)
(children singing)

00:14:59.078 --> 00:15:00.179 position:30% line:89% align:start
- Wait for me!

00:15:02.816 --> 00:15:06.052 position:21% line:89% align:start
Let me go, let me go.

00:15:06.086 --> 00:15:08.990 position:24% line:89% align:start
(children singing)

00:15:35.820 --> 00:15:36.721 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hey!

00:15:37.889 --> 00:15:41.227 position:21% line:83% align:start
I told you to keep a
rope's length away.

00:15:43.397 --> 00:15:44.498 position:30% line:89% align:start
What happened?

00:15:44.531 --> 00:15:46.099 position:16% line:89% align:start
Were you bitten by a fox?

00:15:46.133 --> 00:15:48.236 position:38% line:89% align:start
(giggles)

00:15:49.237 --> 00:15:50.071 position:38% line:89% align:start
- Um, no.

00:15:51.406 --> 00:15:54.075 position:27% line:83% align:start
I'm fine, and now
I think I can find

00:15:54.108 --> 00:15:56.711 position:5% line:89% align:start
my own way back to Borka's Keep.

00:15:58.047 --> 00:15:58.881 position:41% line:89% align:start
- Huh?

00:16:00.783 --> 00:16:03.453 position:16% line:83% align:start
- [Narrator] Ronja stared
at Birk a long time.

00:16:03.486 --> 00:16:05.789 position:27% line:83% align:start
No matter how she
tried, she suddenly

00:16:05.822 --> 00:16:09.160 position:21% line:83% align:start
found it difficult to
think badly of him,

00:16:09.193 --> 00:16:11.229 position:16% line:89% align:start
and she did not know why.

00:16:14.199 --> 00:16:15.400 position:13% line:89% align:start
- It's called Mattis' fort

00:16:15.434 --> 00:16:18.371 position:24% line:83% align:start
and I hope you fall
into Hell's Gap.

00:16:19.539 --> 00:16:22.075 position:35% line:89% align:start
(footsteps)

00:16:23.243 --> 00:16:25.845 position:30% line:89% align:start
(mellow music)

00:16:37.126 --> 00:16:39.462 position:35% line:89% align:start
(footsteps)

00:16:47.971 --> 00:16:52.143 position:10% line:83% align:start
- Lovis is still out, looking
after the sheep and goats.

00:16:53.945 --> 00:16:55.314 position:27% line:83% align:start
The nights always
start to get chilly

00:16:55.347 --> 00:16:57.116 position:30% line:89% align:start
in the autumn.

00:16:57.149 --> 00:16:58.083 position:38% line:89% align:start
- Mattis?

00:16:58.117 --> 00:16:58.884 position:44% line:89% align:start
- Hm?

00:17:00.453 --> 00:17:02.088 position:24% line:83% align:start
- Did you ever take
something from someone

00:17:02.122 --> 00:17:03.790 position:21% line:89% align:start
without asking first?

00:17:05.459 --> 00:17:06.294 position:38% line:89% align:start
- Uh, uh.

00:17:07.461 --> 00:17:10.197 position:30% line:89% align:start
(clears throat)

00:17:10.231 --> 00:17:12.501 position:21% line:83% align:start
When that ghostly fog
started to roll in,

00:17:12.534 --> 00:17:14.336 position:10% line:89% align:start
I was afraid you'd get lost,

00:17:14.369 --> 00:17:17.939 position:19% line:83% align:start
that I'd never see you
again, my little Ronja.

00:17:17.973 --> 00:17:18.608 position:30% line:89% align:start
- It was fine.

00:17:18.641 --> 00:17:20.443 position:21% line:89% align:start
I found my way back.

00:17:23.179 --> 00:17:24.415 position:13% line:89% align:start
But, have you taken things

00:17:24.448 --> 00:17:27.084 position:7% line:89% align:start
without asking for permission?

00:17:29.186 --> 00:17:30.622 position:41% line:89% align:start
- Mmm.

00:17:30.655 --> 00:17:31.990 position:41% line:89% align:start
Well...

00:17:32.023 --> 00:17:34.326 position:10% line:89% align:start
- We've taken lots of things.

00:17:34.359 --> 00:17:35.927 position:24% line:89% align:start
For instance, lots-

00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:38.030 position:27% line:89% align:start
- Quiet, old man.

00:17:38.064 --> 00:17:40.466 position:13% line:83% align:start
I'll deal with this myself,
thank you very much.

00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:43.603 position:30% line:89% align:start
- Oh! (laughs)

00:17:46.473 --> 00:17:48.075 position:35% line:89% align:start
- My Ronja.

00:17:48.108 --> 00:17:50.211 position:7% line:89% align:start
You're still an innocent child,

00:17:50.244 --> 00:17:51.647 position:21% line:83% align:start
which is why I never
wanted to talk to you

00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:53.147 position:27% line:89% align:start
about it before.

00:17:54.450 --> 00:17:55.918 position:44% line:89% align:start
- Hm.

00:17:55.951 --> 00:17:59.356 position:27% line:83% align:start
- No, you haven't
said a word before.

00:17:59.389 --> 00:18:01.991 position:16% line:83% align:start
And of course, we weren't
allowed to say anything, either,

00:18:02.025 --> 00:18:02.592 position:38% line:89% align:start
were we?

00:18:03.627 --> 00:18:06.129 position:5% line:89% align:start
- Ugh, you're rambling, old man.

00:18:06.162 --> 00:18:07.431 position:21% line:89% align:start
Time you went to bed.

00:18:07.465 --> 00:18:09.500 position:24% line:89% align:start
- Oh, no it's not.

00:18:09.533 --> 00:18:11.536 position:21% line:89% align:start
I swear by the devil,

00:18:11.570 --> 00:18:15.540 position:21% line:83% align:start
I intend to stay here
and listen to this.

00:18:15.574 --> 00:18:17.577 position:38% line:89% align:start
(groans)

00:18:18.944 --> 00:18:21.514 position:7% line:89% align:start
- Please hear me out, my Ronja.

00:18:22.716 --> 00:18:23.550 position:41% line:89% align:start
- Mmm.

00:18:24.984 --> 00:18:27.454 position:30% line:89% align:start
(playful music)

00:18:36.064 --> 00:18:40.436 position:13% line:83% align:start
So, when you all came home
with all those things,

00:18:40.469 --> 00:18:44.608 position:7% line:83% align:start
you had taken them from people
passing through the forest?

00:18:44.641 --> 00:18:45.609 position:41% line:89% align:start
- Mmm.

00:18:47.378 --> 00:18:49.647 position:13% line:89% align:start
- But, don't they get angry

00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:51.549 position:24% line:83% align:start
when you take their
things away from them?

00:18:51.582 --> 00:18:53.519 position:10% line:89% align:start
- Oh, do they ever (laughs).

00:18:53.552 --> 00:18:55.220 position:27% line:89% align:start
All the wailing.

00:18:55.254 --> 00:18:55.988 position:33% line:89% align:start
Hee hee hee.

00:18:57.389 --> 00:19:00.125 position:27% line:83% align:start
Ronja, you should
hear them crying.

00:19:01.494 --> 00:19:04.230 position:13% line:89% align:start
- I said it's time for bed.

00:19:04.264 --> 00:19:07.368 position:24% line:83% align:start
- We've even heard
some of the men weep.

00:19:07.401 --> 00:19:08.169 position:38% line:89% align:start
- Quiet!

00:19:09.303 --> 00:19:11.573 position:19% line:83% align:start
You really are pushing
your luck, now.

00:19:11.606 --> 00:19:12.574 position:41% line:89% align:start
Gaaa...

00:19:16.111 --> 00:19:18.614 position:24% line:83% align:start
You mustn't listen
to him, alright?

00:19:18.648 --> 00:19:20.616 position:30% line:83% align:start
It's nothing to
be worried about.

00:19:20.650 --> 00:19:23.420 position:16% line:89% align:start
It's just the way it is.

00:19:23.454 --> 00:19:26.156 position:7% line:89% align:start
It's the way it's always been.

00:19:26.190 --> 00:19:28.158 position:24% line:89% align:start
- Oh, that's right.

00:19:28.192 --> 00:19:29.594 position:24% line:89% align:start
No reason to fuss.

00:19:29.627 --> 00:19:34.098 position:16% line:83% align:start
But those people never do
get used to it, do they?

00:19:34.132 --> 00:19:37.670 position:30% line:83% align:start
They just go on
howling and crying,

00:19:37.703 --> 00:19:39.673 position:16% line:89% align:start
in a most delightful way.

00:19:39.706 --> 00:19:40.707 position:44% line:89% align:start
- Ah!

00:19:40.740 --> 00:19:41.508 position:38% line:89% align:start
- Uh oh!

00:19:43.610 --> 00:19:47.415 position:19% line:83% align:start
- My great-grandfather,
my grandfather, my father

00:19:47.448 --> 00:19:49.317 position:19% line:89% align:start
were all robber chiefs.

00:19:51.552 --> 00:19:52.253 position:33% line:89% align:start
And so am I.

00:19:53.622 --> 00:19:56.391 position:21% line:83% align:start
In all the woods and
mountains, we are the mightiest

00:19:56.425 --> 00:19:57.627 position:27% line:89% align:start
clan of robbers,

00:19:59.094 --> 00:20:03.566 position:19% line:83% align:start
and Ronja, that's what
you will also be one day.

00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:04.635 position:27% line:89% align:start
Isn't that nice?

00:20:06.437 --> 00:20:07.271 position:38% line:89% align:start
- Never!

00:20:08.706 --> 00:20:09.708 position:41% line:89% align:start
- Huh?

00:20:10.642 --> 00:20:12.344 position:30% line:89% align:start
Not on my life.

00:20:12.377 --> 00:20:14.346 position:24% line:83% align:start
If it means people
are made to be angry

00:20:14.379 --> 00:20:16.481 position:13% line:89% align:start
and cry, I'll never steal.

00:20:21.587 --> 00:20:22.355 position:44% line:89% align:start

00:20:25.626 --> 00:20:27.762 position:21% line:89% align:start
You must understand.

00:20:27.795 --> 00:20:31.232 position:27% line:83% align:start
I only ever steal
from the very rich.

Never do I hurt them, much

And,

00:20:38.274 --> 00:20:39.108 position:44% line:89% align:start
yes.

00:20:39.876 --> 00:20:42.312 position:19% line:89% align:start
Sometimes, I even share

00:20:42.345 --> 00:20:44.481 position:7% line:89% align:start
some of the loot with the poor.

00:20:44.514 --> 00:20:46.717 position:7% line:89% align:start
- Mmm, he's telling the truth.

00:20:46.751 --> 00:20:47.451 position:41% line:89% align:start
- Huh?

00:20:48.686 --> 00:20:51.322 position:19% line:83% align:start
- Remember the time you
gave that poor widow

00:20:51.355 --> 00:20:54.626 position:27% line:83% align:start
with eight kids a
whole sack of flour?

00:20:54.660 --> 00:20:55.627 position:35% line:89% align:start
- Oh, yeah.

00:20:55.661 --> 00:20:57.462 position:21% line:89% align:start
- And when was that?

00:20:58.865 --> 00:21:00.700 position:41% line:89% align:start
- Uh...

00:21:00.733 --> 00:21:03.136 position:19% line:83% align:start
- Well, he's certainly
generous giving to the poor

00:21:03.169 --> 00:21:05.138 position:27% line:89% align:start
every ten years.

00:21:05.171 --> 00:21:06.540 position:27% line:89% align:start
Isn't that right?

00:21:06.574 --> 00:21:07.875 position:30% line:89% align:start
You're so kind.

00:21:07.908 --> 00:21:10.144 position:38% line:89% align:start
(laughs)

00:21:11.413 --> 00:21:12.280 position:44% line:89% align:start

Alright that's it!

If you don't wanna
sleep in the woods

00:21:14.884 --> 00:21:18.754 position:13% line:83% align:start
I'd go to bed, because I've
had it up to here with you!

00:21:25.862 --> 00:21:28.766 position:27% line:83% align:start

feel quite sleepy.
