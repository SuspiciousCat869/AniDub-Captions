00:01:39.572 --> 00:01:42.140 position:21% line:83% align:start
- [Narrator] When the
wild beast match was over,

00:01:42.174 --> 00:01:46.679 position:16% line:83% align:start
Mattis prevailed as chief
of both robber clans.

00:01:46.712 --> 00:01:49.380 position:21% line:83% align:start
Borka then found out
that his son Birk,

00:01:49.414 --> 00:01:54.319 position:10% line:83% align:start
like Ronja, had not intention
of ever becoming a robber.

00:01:54.352 --> 00:01:57.589 position:24% line:83% align:start
The two chieftains
decided that they at least

00:01:57.622 --> 00:02:02.326 position:19% line:83% align:start
would continue to enjoy
their splendid robber's life.

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:04.861 position:27% line:89% align:start
(classical music)

00:02:30.385 --> 00:02:32.621 position:27% line:83% align:start
- Old people have
no business freezing

00:02:32.654 --> 00:02:35.356 position:24% line:83% align:start
themselves at wild
beast's matches.

00:02:35.389 --> 00:02:37.324 position:16% line:89% align:start
I did tell you not to go.

00:02:38.559 --> 00:02:41.395 position:24% line:83% align:start
- And I ignored you
because it's boring here.

00:02:41.428 --> 00:02:43.530 position:30% line:83% align:start
They were doing
all the fighting.

00:02:43.564 --> 00:02:45.498 position:16% line:89% align:start
All I did was sit there.

00:02:50.703 --> 00:02:54.239 position:19% line:83% align:start
- Anyway, it's time you
used those big ears of yours

00:02:54.272 --> 00:02:59.444 position:10% line:83% align:start
to listen to how I'm getting
with my new robber life.

00:02:59.478 --> 00:03:01.580 position:16% line:89% align:start
Borka's doing a good job.

00:03:01.613 --> 00:03:03.548 position:13% line:89% align:start
He isn't too loud mouthed.

00:03:03.582 --> 00:03:05.617 position:30% line:83% align:start
In fact, he has
his wits about him,

00:03:05.651 --> 00:03:10.454 position:16% line:83% align:start
enough to please me, and
you know how hard that is.

00:03:10.488 --> 00:03:13.624 position:27% line:83% align:start
So now the two of
us work together.

00:03:13.658 --> 00:03:17.595 position:21% line:83% align:start
Which means we bring
back double the loot.

00:03:17.628 --> 00:03:20.196 position:24% line:83% align:start
We've been fooling
all the sheriff's men.

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:22.198 position:13% line:89% align:start
(laughs) It's a joy to see.

00:03:22.232 --> 00:03:23.800 position:24% line:83% align:start
And soon, Mattis's
forest with be

00:03:23.833 --> 00:03:26.536 position:27% line:83% align:start
free of all those
pesky soldiers.

00:03:32.574 --> 00:03:36.779 position:7% line:83% align:start
- Always save the bragging for
when you're riding back home.

00:03:39.448 --> 00:03:42.518 position:24% line:83% align:start
- But you are home
and going nowhere.

00:03:43.652 --> 00:03:44.820 position:30% line:89% align:start
- Noddle-Pete.

00:03:46.354 --> 00:03:46.688 position:44% line:89% align:start
Tada!

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:52.360 position:19% line:83% align:start
Take this on yourself,
it'll tide the chill away.

00:03:55.029 --> 00:03:58.933 position:13% line:83% align:start
Oh, my dear, you look finer
than the count himself.

00:03:58.966 --> 00:04:00.701 position:35% line:89% align:start
(laughing)

00:04:00.734 --> 00:04:03.437 position:33% line:83% align:start
- Hey, you're
looking snug there.

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:04.604 position:24% line:83% align:start
It's not often that
you find yourself-

00:04:04.638 --> 00:04:07.306 position:30% line:89% align:start
(horn blowing)

00:04:08.775 --> 00:04:10.977 position:19% line:89% align:start
- Put that thing down.

00:04:11.011 --> 00:04:12.445 position:35% line:89% align:start
(laughing)

00:04:12.478 --> 00:04:13.979 position:13% line:89% align:start
- The best find of the day.

00:04:14.013 --> 00:04:18.583 position:13% line:83% align:start
- [Lovis] All of you better
tidy the place up before dinner.

00:04:18.617 --> 00:04:21.419 position:7% line:83% align:start
- [Lill-Klippen] I'll blast you
straight into Hell's Gap.

00:04:21.453 --> 00:04:24.622 position:30% line:89% align:start
(horn blowing)

00:04:24.656 --> 00:04:25.690 position:19% line:89% align:start
- [Lovis] Give me that.

00:04:25.724 --> 00:04:27.926 position:35% line:89% align:start
(laughing)

00:04:32.496 --> 00:04:33.897 position:30% line:89% align:start
(upbeat music)

00:04:33.932 --> 00:04:38.035 position:16% line:83% align:start
- [Mattis] Don't squeeze
so, ow, is that your knee?

00:04:38.068 --> 00:04:41.504 position:19% line:83% align:start
- Oh, Mattis, you're so
kind to share my bed.

00:04:41.537 --> 00:04:44.741 position:24% line:83% align:start
At last, I feel the
chill melting away.

00:04:46.809 --> 00:04:50.646 position:19% line:83% align:start
You're body is as warm
as glowing embers.

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:54.349 position:24% line:83% align:start
Finally, I'll get a
good night's rest.

00:04:54.382 --> 00:04:57.552 position:16% line:89% align:start
(upbeat classical music)

00:05:02.858 --> 00:05:06.327 position:19% line:89% align:start
(rustling and groaning)

00:05:11.398 --> 00:05:13.400 position:27% line:83% align:start
- Don't you ever
clean your toenails?

00:05:13.434 --> 00:05:15.636 position:35% line:89% align:start
(screaming)

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:21.641 position:7% line:83% align:start
It's not as if you're a Rumphob
clinging to a bear's stomach.

00:05:21.674 --> 00:05:23.376 position:19% line:89% align:start
(grunting and rustling)

00:05:23.409 --> 00:05:25.478 position:19% line:89% align:start
Just a bit more space?

00:05:25.512 --> 00:05:27.312 position:35% line:89% align:start
(groaning)

00:05:27.346 --> 00:05:29.716 position:35% line:89% align:start
(laughing)

00:05:29.749 --> 00:05:33.285 position:16% line:89% align:start
(upbeat classical music)

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:40.491 position:30% line:89% align:start
- There, look.

00:05:40.525 --> 00:05:43.661 position:16% line:89% align:start
(upbeat classical music)

00:05:44.595 --> 00:05:46.464 position:5% line:89% align:start
- So the earthworms and even the

00:05:46.497 --> 00:05:48.900 position:10% line:89% align:start
snakes have gone underground.

00:05:48.933 --> 00:05:51.501 position:27% line:83% align:start
- Not to mention
the goblin folk.

00:05:51.535 --> 00:05:53.470 position:24% line:83% align:start
They've disappeared
somewhere too.

00:05:53.503 --> 00:05:56.606 position:16% line:89% align:start
- Ah, the empty forests.

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:59.709 position:24% line:83% align:start
You never know when
it'll finally decide

00:05:59.743 --> 00:06:02.511 position:27% line:83% align:start
to drag you down
under its leaves.

00:06:03.512 --> 00:06:05.048 position:24% line:89% align:start
- What if I helped?

00:06:05.081 --> 00:06:08.118 position:16% line:83% align:start
I'll wake up every small
bug sleeping in the earth,

00:06:08.151 --> 00:06:13.622 position:10% line:83% align:start
and I'll drag them up myself,
I'll do whatever it takes.

00:06:13.656 --> 00:06:14.924 position:33% line:89% align:start
- We're home.

00:06:14.957 --> 00:06:16.926 position:35% line:89% align:start
(sneezing)

00:06:16.959 --> 00:06:18.626 position:13% line:89% align:start
- [Man] Freezing, freezing.

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:22.897 position:21% line:83% align:start
- Chilled to the bone
with this all terrain.

00:06:22.931 --> 00:06:27.401 position:13% line:83% align:start
- [Mattis] What's this, you
lecturing the two kids, old man?

00:06:27.434 --> 00:06:29.670 position:24% line:83% align:start
- The little snake
and the little harpy.

00:06:29.703 --> 00:06:32.606 position:13% line:83% align:start
Whatever the old man says,
he's preaching to deaf ears.

00:06:32.639 --> 00:06:34.741 position:35% line:89% align:start
(laughing)

00:06:34.775 --> 00:06:36.977 position:24% line:83% align:start
- Come on children,
what about us then?

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:39.579 position:16% line:83% align:start
I got far better stories
than the old man does.

00:06:39.612 --> 00:06:41.915 position:13% line:89% align:start
All you have to do is ask.

00:06:41.949 --> 00:06:43.883 position:5% line:89% align:start
- (laughs) Why would I ask about

00:06:43.916 --> 00:06:46.085 position:10% line:89% align:start
smelly, dirty, devil robbers?

00:06:46.118 --> 00:06:48.487 position:35% line:89% align:start
(laughing)

00:06:50.555 --> 00:06:51.791 position:38% line:89% align:start
- Enough.

00:06:51.824 --> 00:06:54.492 position:30% line:83% align:start
Go home back to
your nest, little snake.

00:06:54.526 --> 00:06:56.494 position:27% line:83% align:start
I'm sure your own
father's waiting,

00:06:56.528 --> 00:06:58.830 position:13% line:89% align:start
smelling just as bad as us.

00:06:58.864 --> 00:07:01.600 position:30% line:89% align:start
(upbeat music)

00:07:06.137 --> 00:07:08.973 position:27% line:83% align:start
- Ah yes, this is
how I wanted it.

00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:12.076 position:19% line:89% align:start
Now I can happily wait.

00:07:13.744 --> 00:07:17.513 position:24% line:83% align:start
- Old man, what're
you waiting for?

00:07:17.547 --> 00:07:20.583 position:13% line:89% align:start
- Well, what do you think?

00:07:23.519 --> 00:07:26.488 position:27% line:89% align:start
(fire crackling)

00:07:39.968 --> 00:07:43.838 position:13% line:83% align:start
- I've never seen him like
this, just seems so tired.

00:07:43.871 --> 00:07:45.973 position:21% line:89% align:start
I wonder what it is.

00:07:46.007 --> 00:07:47.507 position:24% line:89% align:start
- It's his old age.

00:07:48.776 --> 00:07:53.047 position:21% line:83% align:start
- Well he is old, but
he won't die will he?

00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:54.481 position:30% line:89% align:start
- Yes, he will.

00:07:56.049 --> 00:07:58.118 position:27% line:89% align:start
- What was that?

00:07:58.151 --> 00:08:03.555 position:10% line:83% align:start
No, you can't say that, don't
say that, don't you dare.

00:08:03.589 --> 00:08:05.791 position:35% line:89% align:start
(shouting)

00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:11.096 position:27% line:83% align:start
- It's done, you
decide a lot of things.

00:08:12.664 --> 00:08:16.501 position:21% line:83% align:start
But Mattis, you can't
decide on this, can you?

00:08:22.140 --> 00:08:24.508 position:38% line:89% align:start
(sobbing)

00:08:41.023 --> 00:08:45.194 position:16% line:89% align:start
(somber classical music)

00:08:45.227 --> 00:08:47.662 position:33% line:89% align:start
(baby crying)

00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:53.702 position:33% line:89% align:start
- Is he here?

00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:00.075 position:41% line:89% align:start
Mattis.

00:09:02.177 --> 00:09:06.747 position:10% line:83% align:start
Perfect name for a chieftain,
a robber chieftain.

00:09:18.791 --> 00:09:21.661 position:27% line:83% align:start
Noddle-pete grew
weaker and weaker.

00:09:25.298 --> 00:09:27.133 position:19% line:89% align:start
- [Ronja] Noddle-Pete.

00:09:28.633 --> 00:09:29.835 position:30% line:83% align:start
- [Narrator] He
spent most of his

00:09:29.868 --> 00:09:33.672 position:24% line:83% align:start
days lying in bed,
his eyes closed.

00:10:17.979 --> 00:10:18.813 position:41% line:89% align:start
- He...

00:10:19.881 --> 00:10:21.715 position:44% line:89% align:start
He...

00:10:21.748 --> 00:10:22.917 position:27% line:89% align:start
He can't be gone.

00:10:24.651 --> 00:10:26.720 position:16% line:89% align:start
- Hey, hey, keep it down.

00:10:30.057 --> 00:10:33.659 position:27% line:83% align:start
Don't you think I
have enough manners

00:10:33.692 --> 00:10:36.829 position:21% line:83% align:start
to say goodbye before
I leave this place?

00:10:39.299 --> 00:10:42.134 position:27% line:89% align:start
(heavy breathing)

00:10:59.384 --> 00:11:00.218 position:35% line:89% align:start
It's time.

00:11:01.718 --> 00:11:02.353 position:44% line:89% align:start
Time.

00:11:05.823 --> 00:11:08.859 position:19% line:89% align:start
My good, good friends,

00:11:09.792 --> 00:11:13.930 position:7% line:89% align:start
I shall take leave of you all.

00:11:13.963 --> 00:11:16.132 position:38% line:89% align:start
(gasping)

00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:20.903 position:24% line:89% align:start
And now, farewell.

00:11:20.937 --> 00:11:21.938 position:33% line:89% align:start
I shall die.

00:11:30.779 --> 00:11:33.081 position:38% line:89% align:start
(crying)

00:11:33.115 --> 00:11:36.650 position:16% line:89% align:start
(somber classical music)

00:11:38.119 --> 00:11:42.756 position:21% line:83% align:start
- This man has always
been by my side.

00:11:45.758 --> 00:11:47.161 position:27% line:89% align:start
And now he's not.

00:11:49.762 --> 00:11:51.898 position:35% line:89% align:start
(screaming)

00:11:55.468 --> 00:11:57.170 position:38% line:89% align:start
This man

00:11:58.271 --> 00:12:00.105 position:35% line:89% align:start
has always

00:12:01.907 --> 00:12:03.175 position:38% line:89% align:start
been here

00:12:05.244 --> 00:12:08.813 position:41% line:89% align:start
and now

00:12:10.249 --> 00:12:11.749 position:38% line:89% align:start
he's not.

00:12:12.284 --> 00:12:14.652 position:38% line:89% align:start
(sobbing)

00:12:22.293 --> 00:12:25.929 position:19% line:83% align:start
He's always been here,
but now...

00:12:27.831 --> 00:12:29.099 position:33% line:89% align:start
...he's not.

00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:30.934 position:38% line:89% align:start
- Mattis.

00:12:32.935 --> 00:12:35.305 position:13% line:89% align:start
No one can always be there.

00:12:35.338 --> 00:12:36.739 position:30% line:89% align:start
We all move on.

00:12:37.907 --> 00:12:41.277 position:27% line:83% align:start
We're born and we
die, that's it,

00:12:41.310 --> 00:12:43.778 position:13% line:89% align:start
it's always been like that.

00:12:44.946 --> 00:12:47.182 position:13% line:89% align:start
What're you so upset about?

00:12:49.884 --> 00:12:50.985 position:33% line:89% align:start
- I miss him.

00:12:52.854 --> 00:12:53.787 position:35% line:89% align:start
I miss him.

00:12:55.756 --> 00:13:00.395 position:24% line:83% align:start
I miss him so much,
it breaks my heart.

00:13:01.895 --> 00:13:05.065 position:16% line:83% align:start
- I know you're hurting,
let me hold you.

00:13:08.335 --> 00:13:10.703 position:38% line:89% align:start
(sobbing)

00:13:15.408 --> 00:13:19.078 position:21% line:83% align:start
- You might as well,
you too Ronja, you too.

00:13:29.887 --> 00:13:31.855 position:38% line:89% align:start
(sobbing)

00:13:32.990 --> 00:13:36.393 position:16% line:89% align:start
(somber classical music)

00:14:26.940 --> 00:14:30.277 position:19% line:89% align:start
(shouting and laughing)

00:15:07.076 --> 00:15:10.446 position:13% line:89% align:start
Ronja, help me in my grief.

00:15:12.014 --> 00:15:14.517 position:7% line:89% align:start
I need you here to comfort me.

00:15:25.627 --> 00:15:28.163 position:7% line:89% align:start
- Spring's not far away, I can

00:15:28.196 --> 00:15:31.533 position:19% line:83% align:start
almost tell, and you'll
feel better soon.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:37.971 position:21% line:83% align:start
- Noddle-Pete, no, he
won't see spring again.

00:15:43.943 --> 00:15:45.478 position:7% line:89% align:start
- [Narrator] Winter passed, and

00:15:45.511 --> 00:15:48.981 position:7% line:89% align:start
spring came, as it always did.

00:15:49.015 --> 00:15:52.050 position:27% line:83% align:start
(horses neighing
and goats bleating)

00:15:52.084 --> 00:15:54.354 position:10% line:89% align:start
No matter who lived or died.

00:16:00.058 --> 00:16:02.993 position:5% line:89% align:start
Mattis slowly began to cheer up.

00:16:03.027 --> 00:16:04.496 position:41% line:89% align:start
- Away.

00:16:04.529 --> 00:16:08.332 position:24% line:83% align:start
- [Narrator] As he
did every spring.

00:16:08.366 --> 00:16:11.635 position:27% line:89% align:start
(goats bleating)

00:16:11.669 --> 00:16:14.171 position:30% line:89% align:start
(upbeat music)

00:16:25.382 --> 00:16:28.117 position:16% line:83% align:start
- I know what you mean, I
always thought I'd grow up

00:16:28.150 --> 00:16:29.952 position:5% line:89% align:start
to be a robber, and then one day

00:16:29.985 --> 00:16:32.588 position:21% line:83% align:start
I finally worked out
what it actually meant.

00:16:32.622 --> 00:16:35.257 position:35% line:89% align:start
(laughing)

00:16:35.290 --> 00:16:39.294 position:27% line:83% align:start
- Ah well, don't
forget, I took an oath.

00:16:39.328 --> 00:16:42.698 position:24% line:83% align:start
I do wonder though,
without doing any robbing,

00:16:42.731 --> 00:16:45.233 position:27% line:83% align:start
what're we gonna
live on, you and I?

00:16:45.266 --> 00:16:47.268 position:35% line:89% align:start
(laughing)

00:16:47.301 --> 00:16:51.339 position:21% line:83% align:start
- Don't worry, that's
easy, I think I know a way.

00:16:51.372 --> 00:16:54.441 position:27% line:83% align:start
- Listen, when I
was young, I spent

00:16:54.474 --> 00:16:58.044 position:30% line:83% align:start
my time in the
woods, just like you.

00:16:58.078 --> 00:17:00.147 position:35% line:89% align:start
(screaming)

00:17:04.351 --> 00:17:07.319 position:21% line:83% align:start
I happened on day to
save the life of a

00:17:07.353 --> 00:17:11.457 position:16% line:83% align:start
little gray dwarf who was
being attacked by a harpy.

00:17:13.759 --> 00:17:17.663 position:24% line:83% align:start
This little fellow
was ever so grateful.

00:17:17.696 --> 00:17:20.198 position:7% line:89% align:start
He showed me a cave, and it was

00:17:20.231 --> 00:17:23.234 position:24% line:83% align:start
filled to the brim
with shiny silver.

00:17:26.136 --> 00:17:31.141 position:16% line:83% align:start
You will find this place,
but only when the time comes.

00:17:31.175 --> 00:17:33.744 position:7% line:89% align:start
It's out there waiting, waiting

00:17:33.777 --> 00:17:36.380 position:5% line:89% align:start
for you my little pride and joy.

00:17:37.548 --> 00:17:40.651 position:27% line:83% align:start
- Yes, I'll find
it, I'm sure I will.

00:17:42.619 --> 00:17:45.421 position:30% line:83% align:start
It's out there,
he told me, I know

00:17:45.455 --> 00:17:48.391 position:24% line:83% align:start
it's not some sort
of fairy tale.

00:17:48.424 --> 00:17:51.059 position:7% line:89% align:start
Noddle-Pete swore it was true.

00:17:53.696 --> 00:17:57.232 position:10% line:83% align:start
Sometime soon, we should get
our horses and ride up there,

00:17:57.265 --> 00:18:01.369 position:7% line:83% align:start
and have a look around, because
I think I know where it is.

00:18:04.573 --> 00:18:07.107 position:10% line:89% align:start
- There's no hurry for that.

00:18:07.141 --> 00:18:09.643 position:30% line:89% align:start
(upbeat music)

00:18:11.745 --> 00:18:14.482 position:27% line:83% align:start
Anyway, let's try
and make sure we

00:18:14.515 --> 00:18:17.283 position:21% line:83% align:start
keep it just between
us, a secret.

00:18:18.819 --> 00:18:21.221 position:10% line:89% align:start
Just imagine all the robbers.

00:18:21.254 --> 00:18:22.689 position:38% line:89% align:start
(laughs)

00:18:22.722 --> 00:18:25.592 position:24% line:83% align:start
Trying to get their
hands on all that silver.

00:18:25.625 --> 00:18:27.993 position:35% line:89% align:start
(laughing)

00:18:30.797 --> 00:18:34.132 position:19% line:83% align:start
- I knew it, you're as
wise as Noddle-Pete.

00:18:34.166 --> 00:18:36.401 position:21% line:83% align:start
That's exactly why I
didn't want to tell

00:18:36.435 --> 00:18:39.470 position:30% line:83% align:start
this secret to
anyone else but you.

00:18:39.505 --> 00:18:42.473 position:10% line:89% align:start
- Besides, we'll be alright.

00:18:42.507 --> 00:18:48.144 position:10% line:83% align:start
We can get by without needing
any silver, right sister mine?

00:18:50.681 --> 00:18:54.284 position:21% line:83% align:start
It's getting warmer,
we've plenty to do,

00:18:54.317 --> 00:18:57.287 position:24% line:83% align:start
like gather things
for the bear's cave.

00:19:00.824 --> 00:19:02.692 position:24% line:83% align:start
- [Ronja] If Mattis
hears that we're planning

00:19:02.726 --> 00:19:06.362 position:19% line:83% align:start
to move there again, I
wonder what he'll say.

00:19:08.397 --> 00:19:10.733 position:35% line:89% align:start
(murmuring)

00:19:12.501 --> 00:19:15.103 position:10% line:89% align:start
- Oh, you again, after Ronja?

00:19:16.304 --> 00:19:19.674 position:19% line:83% align:start
- Actually, you're the
one I'm here to see.

00:19:24.879 --> 00:19:27.649 position:27% line:83% align:start
- I remember the
old bear's cave.

00:19:29.383 --> 00:19:31.818 position:30% line:83% align:start
Yeah, oh when I
was your age I was

00:19:31.852 --> 00:19:34.388 position:33% line:83% align:start
in and out of
there all the time.

00:19:34.421 --> 00:19:36.490 position:24% line:83% align:start
It's a fine place,
no better place

00:19:36.523 --> 00:19:39.091 position:10% line:89% align:start
to live at this time of year.

00:19:42.562 --> 00:19:44.730 position:13% line:89% align:start
Don't you think so, Lovis?

00:19:46.599 --> 00:19:51.436 position:16% line:83% align:start
- You can go, of course,
your father and I both agree.

00:19:54.306 --> 00:19:58.276 position:16% line:83% align:start
It'll be quieter with you
both gone, you'll be missed.

00:20:07.284 --> 00:20:09.320 position:35% line:89% align:start
(laughing)

00:20:11.488 --> 00:20:14.157 position:7% line:89% align:start
- You'd better return together

00:20:14.190 --> 00:20:17.226 position:24% line:83% align:start
before winter, and
I'm sure you will.

00:20:21.864 --> 00:20:25.868 position:16% line:83% align:start
- Yes, we will, just like
we did last year, right?

00:20:27.469 --> 00:20:32.240 position:13% line:83% align:start
- Also, that cave is really
mine, don't you forget it.

00:20:34.241 --> 00:20:38.212 position:16% line:83% align:start
And every so often, from
time to time, I'll call in.

00:20:39.614 --> 00:20:42.183 position:16% line:89% align:start
- You can come whenever.

00:20:42.216 --> 00:20:45.251 position:16% line:83% align:start
Although, given all we've
been through, it'll be a

00:20:45.285 --> 00:20:47.888 position:19% line:83% align:start
relief not to see your
black curly head every day,

00:20:47.922 --> 00:20:52.525 position:10% line:83% align:start
so on second thought, I think
you should just stay away.

00:20:52.559 --> 00:20:55.228 position:27% line:83% align:start
- Yes, I have to
agree with that.

00:21:00.332 --> 00:21:02.368 position:35% line:89% align:start
(laughing)

00:21:15.246 --> 00:21:16.781 position:35% line:89% align:start
- Off I go.

00:21:16.814 --> 00:21:19.182 position:35% line:89% align:start
(laughing)

00:21:34.397 --> 00:21:36.232 position:19% line:89% align:start
- Off I go, it's time.

00:21:39.335 --> 00:21:40.636 position:24% line:89% align:start
- Off you go then.

00:21:50.311 --> 00:21:52.347 position:35% line:89% align:start
