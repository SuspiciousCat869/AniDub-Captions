(laughs)

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:49.022 position:24% line:83% align:start
- [Narrator] Summer
came to Mattis' forest.

00:01:49.055 --> 00:01:52.193 position:21% line:83% align:start
Ronja and Birk tamed
their wild horses

00:01:52.226 --> 00:01:55.196 position:27% line:83% align:start
and settled into
a happy routine.

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:59.000 position:19% line:83% align:start
It seems nothing could
disrupt their lives.

00:01:59.033 --> 00:02:00.968 position:30% line:89% align:start
Until one day,

00:02:01.002 --> 00:02:03.170 position:10% line:89% align:start
an unexpected guest appeared.

00:02:17.085 --> 00:02:18.320 position:30% line:89% align:start
- Look at that!

00:02:19.221 --> 00:02:20.922 position:24% line:89% align:start
It's Lill-Klippen!

00:02:25.295 --> 00:02:26.094 position:38% line:89% align:start
You came!

00:02:27.297 --> 00:02:30.900 position:21% line:83% align:start
You found me, I can't
believe you're here!

00:02:33.169 --> 00:02:35.838 position:10% line:89% align:start
- Wow, will you look at that?

00:02:35.872 --> 00:02:38.107 position:7% line:89% align:start
What a lovely view you've got.

00:02:39.476 --> 00:02:43.146 position:21% line:83% align:start
- Yes, on a clear day
you can see everything.

00:02:43.179 --> 00:02:45.048 position:7% line:89% align:start
But I can't believe that's what

00:02:45.081 --> 00:02:46.450 position:13% line:89% align:start
you came all this way for.

00:02:46.483 --> 00:02:48.519 position:38% line:89% align:start
(laughs)

00:02:52.022 --> 00:02:53.824 position:24% line:89% align:start
- No, you're right.

00:02:54.958 --> 00:02:57.428 position:5% line:89% align:start
Lovis sent me to give you these.

00:03:02.066 --> 00:03:03.134 position:33% line:89% align:start
- It's bread!

00:03:06.971 --> 00:03:08.006 position:30% line:89% align:start
Smells so good,

00:03:09.507 --> 00:03:11.643 position:24% line:89% align:start
my mother's bread,

00:03:11.677 --> 00:03:15.548 position:16% line:83% align:start
I've forgotten there was
anything so wonderful.

00:03:25.257 --> 00:03:27.426 position:13% line:89% align:start
Birk, here's some for you.

00:03:36.636 --> 00:03:38.205 position:35% line:89% align:start
- You see,

00:03:38.238 --> 00:03:42.342 position:16% line:83% align:start
she figured that you'd be
running low on food about now.

00:03:46.613 --> 00:03:48.683 position:10% line:89% align:start
- But how, how did Lovis know

00:03:48.716 --> 00:03:51.051 position:19% line:83% align:start
that you would find us
both in the bear's cave

00:03:51.084 --> 00:03:51.519 position:35% line:89% align:start
hiding out?

00:03:52.953 --> 00:03:57.425 position:19% line:83% align:start
- Well, your mother is
nobody's fool, is she?

00:03:57.458 --> 00:04:01.562 position:13% line:83% align:start
She worked it out and knew
exactly where you'd gone.

00:04:20.082 --> 00:04:21.550 position:33% line:89% align:start
Look, Ronja.

00:04:28.558 --> 00:04:31.093 position:10% line:89% align:start
Why don't you come home, eh?

00:04:43.674 --> 00:04:46.009 position:16% line:83% align:start
- [Ronja] How are things
been at Mattis' Fort

00:04:46.042 --> 00:04:47.043 position:33% line:89% align:start
since I left?

00:04:54.452 --> 00:04:58.622 position:16% line:83% align:start
- Everything's fine, same
as always, nobody's sad.

00:05:00.692 --> 00:05:02.526 position:19% line:89% align:start
Come back home, Ronja.

00:05:04.061 --> 00:05:05.362 position:27% line:89% align:start
- Lovis sent you.

00:05:05.396 --> 00:05:07.031 position:10% line:89% align:start
It's obvious, I know she did,

00:05:07.064 --> 00:05:09.634 position:27% line:83% align:start
and she sent you
to bring me home.

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:13.171 position:44% line:89% align:start
- Oh.

00:05:14.206 --> 00:05:17.275 position:5% line:89% align:start
Yes, it's difficult without you.

00:05:17.309 --> 00:05:20.278 position:30% line:83% align:start
Ronja, everyone
is waiting for you

00:05:20.312 --> 00:05:22.047 position:24% line:89% align:start
to come back to us.

00:05:27.052 --> 00:05:28.119 position:33% line:89% align:start
- And Mattis?

00:05:29.222 --> 00:05:30.055 position:41% line:89% align:start
- Huh?

00:05:32.291 --> 00:05:35.328 position:19% line:83% align:start
- Mattis too, and does
he want me back home?

00:05:35.361 --> 00:05:36.128 position:35% line:89% align:start
Be honest.

00:05:45.439 --> 00:05:47.106 position:24% line:89% align:start
- Oh, I can't lie!

00:05:48.108 --> 00:05:50.244 position:27% line:83% align:start
That beast, it's
impossible to get

00:05:50.277 --> 00:05:52.112 position:19% line:89% align:start
inside that man's head!

00:05:55.315 --> 00:05:59.487 position:19% line:83% align:start
- Lill-Klippen, does he
talk about me anymore, ever?

00:06:04.259 --> 00:06:07.562 position:21% line:83% align:start
Please, Lill-Klippen,
tell me the truth!

00:06:10.098 --> 00:06:12.600 position:7% line:89% align:start
Has he never mentioned my name

00:06:12.634 --> 00:06:13.736 position:30% line:89% align:start
not even once?

00:06:16.705 --> 00:06:19.240 position:5% line:89% align:start
- No, and no one else is allowed

00:06:19.274 --> 00:06:23.111 position:21% line:83% align:start
to mention your name
either, he's forbidden it.

00:06:35.592 --> 00:06:37.761 position:19% line:83% align:start
But everything will be
alright once you come home,

00:06:37.794 --> 00:06:38.562 position:38% line:89% align:start
won't it?

00:06:39.696 --> 00:06:42.232 position:24% line:83% align:start
Then it'll be back
to normal, eh?

00:06:43.733 --> 00:06:47.170 position:21% line:83% align:start
- Never, and you can
tell that to Mattis!

00:06:48.705 --> 00:06:51.241 position:24% line:83% align:start
I'm not his child,
he said so himself,

00:06:51.274 --> 00:06:53.143 position:19% line:89% align:start
so, he's not my father!

00:06:54.177 --> 00:06:56.347 position:10% line:89% align:start
I want you to tell him that.

00:06:56.380 --> 00:07:00.251 position:19% line:83% align:start
I want the whole forest
to hear you shout it!

00:07:00.284 --> 00:07:02.219 position:41% line:89% align:start
(cries)

00:07:03.287 --> 00:07:04.088 position:44% line:89% align:start
- Oh!

00:07:05.489 --> 00:07:09.226 position:27% line:83% align:start
You know I can't
possibly do that, Ronja.

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:11.162 position:27% line:89% align:start
Even Noddle-Pete

00:07:11.195 --> 00:07:14.666 position:21% line:83% align:start
wouldn't dare do what
you're asking me to do.

00:07:15.934 --> 00:07:18.303 position:38% line:89% align:start
(sobbing)

00:07:26.846 --> 00:07:29.281 position:33% line:83% align:start
- [Narrator]
Lill-Klippen told Ronja

00:07:29.314 --> 00:07:31.851 position:7% line:89% align:start
all the news from Mattis' Fort.

00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:37.290 position:19% line:83% align:start
- [Lill-Klippen] Mattis
is in a tremendous rage

00:07:37.323 --> 00:07:38.391 position:27% line:89% align:start
day in, day out.

00:07:40.393 --> 00:07:42.562 position:38% line:89% align:start
(yelling)

00:07:51.270 --> 00:07:52.506 position:27% line:89% align:start
- Say that again!

00:07:53.507 --> 00:07:55.776 position:35% line:89% align:start
(grunting)

00:08:03.384 --> 00:08:06.220 position:21% line:83% align:start
- [Lill-Klippen] And
Noddle-Pete has lost his spark.

00:08:06.253 --> 00:08:08.590 position:19% line:83% align:start
But with everything all
miserable at the fort,

00:08:08.623 --> 00:08:10.257 position:24% line:89% align:start
who can blame him?

00:08:13.495 --> 00:08:16.831 position:24% line:83% align:start
Robbery business is
going badly as well.

00:08:19.234 --> 00:08:22.537 position:24% line:83% align:start
The whole forest is
teeming with soldiers.

00:08:26.542 --> 00:08:28.644 position:5% line:89% align:start
They caught Pelje and put him in

00:08:28.678 --> 00:08:31.747 position:10% line:89% align:start
one of the sheriff's dungeons

00:08:31.781 --> 00:08:33.849 position:19% line:83% align:start
with nothing but stale
bread and dirty water

00:08:33.883 --> 00:08:35.317 position:35% line:89% align:start
to live on.

00:08:35.351 --> 00:08:38.354 position:21% line:89% align:start
(gentle flute music)

00:08:50.033 --> 00:08:51.301 position:33% line:89% align:start
- [Pelje] Oh!

00:09:07.752 --> 00:09:08.986 position:21% line:89% align:start
- Word is that there

00:09:09.020 --> 00:09:12.290 position:24% line:83% align:start
are two of Borka's
men in there as well.

00:09:13.725 --> 00:09:15.293 position:7% line:89% align:start
They say the sheriff swore that

00:09:15.326 --> 00:09:17.562 position:30% line:83% align:start
all the robbers
in Mattis' forest

00:09:17.596 --> 00:09:19.363 position:19% line:89% align:start
would be taken captive

00:09:20.699 --> 00:09:23.736 position:27% line:83% align:start
and receive their
rightful punishment.

00:09:23.769 --> 00:09:24.870 position:30% line:89% align:start
It's terrible.

00:09:28.807 --> 00:09:32.344 position:5% line:89% align:start
I wonder what will happen to us.

00:09:32.377 --> 00:09:34.446 position:27% line:83% align:start
The sheriff might
string everyone up.

00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:37.884 position:19% line:83% align:start
- So, tell me, does he
ever laugh these days?

00:09:41.087 --> 00:09:44.390 position:13% line:89% align:start
- Who could you mean then?

00:09:44.424 --> 00:09:45.358 position:33% line:89% align:start
The sheriff?

00:09:46.626 --> 00:09:47.962 position:19% line:89% align:start
- You know who I mean.

00:09:47.995 --> 00:09:49.295 position:30% line:89% align:start
Mattis is who.

00:09:54.334 --> 00:09:55.770 position:27% line:89% align:start
- No, he doesn't.

00:09:56.871 --> 00:09:58.304 position:13% line:89% align:start
Ever since the day you left

00:09:58.339 --> 00:10:00.508 position:30% line:83% align:start
to cross Hell's
Gap to Borka's Keep,

00:10:00.541 --> 00:10:03.377 position:27% line:83% align:start
nobody has heard
Mattis laugh once,

00:10:03.410 --> 00:10:04.478 position:27% line:89% align:start
he's just angry.

00:10:13.855 --> 00:10:17.425 position:19% line:89% align:start
Ronja, come home, yeah?

00:10:17.459 --> 00:10:18.994 position:35% line:89% align:start
Come home,

00:10:19.027 --> 00:10:21.496 position:10% line:89% align:start
or else your mother would...

00:10:25.433 --> 00:10:27.469 position:13% line:89% align:start
- Give my regards to Lovis,

00:10:28.838 --> 00:10:32.942 position:19% line:83% align:start
and please thank her a
thousand times for the bread.

00:10:42.885 --> 00:10:43.719 position:44% line:89% align:start
- Oh.

00:10:51.028 --> 00:10:53.597 position:10% line:89% align:start
I forgot the salt, didn't I?

00:10:53.630 --> 00:10:55.732 position:13% line:89% align:start
- Thank you, Lill-Klippen.

00:11:05.442 --> 00:11:06.410 position:30% line:89% align:start
- [Birk] I see.

00:11:06.443 --> 00:11:08.378 position:19% line:83% align:start
So, you didn't go home
with that dirty devil

00:11:08.412 --> 00:11:09.413 position:30% line:89% align:start
to your father.

00:11:21.626 --> 00:11:25.130 position:24% line:83% align:start
- No, listen to me,
I have no father!

00:11:25.164 --> 00:11:27.066 position:27% line:83% align:start
Birk, you should
really watch what

00:11:27.099 --> 00:11:28.868 position:24% line:89% align:start
you're saying to me

00:11:28.901 --> 00:11:30.069 position:13% line:89% align:start
or you might well find out

00:11:30.102 --> 00:11:33.873 position:21% line:83% align:start
that I no longer have
a brother either!

00:11:33.906 --> 00:11:36.009 position:13% line:89% align:start
- Forgive me, sister mine,

00:11:38.744 --> 00:11:41.815 position:27% line:83% align:start
if you think I'm
being unfair to you.

00:11:46.219 --> 00:11:48.889 position:5% line:89% align:start
But, since we came to live here,

00:11:50.090 --> 00:11:51.791 position:24% line:83% align:start
I know what you're
thinking sometimes,

00:11:51.825 --> 00:11:53.426 position:21% line:89% align:start
I know you too well.

00:11:55.096 --> 00:11:56.630 position:33% line:89% align:start
- Is that so?

00:11:56.663 --> 00:11:59.133 position:30% line:83% align:start
Then you should
know at this moment,

00:11:59.166 --> 00:12:01.568 position:27% line:83% align:start
I'm thinking that
I've been alive

00:12:01.602 --> 00:12:03.170 position:24% line:83% align:start
for 11 winters but
the 12th would be

00:12:03.204 --> 00:12:05.139 position:27% line:89% align:start
the death of me.

00:12:05.172 --> 00:12:08.576 position:19% line:83% align:start
And actually, I'd very
much like to stay alive

00:12:08.609 --> 00:12:09.777 position:24% line:89% align:start
and on this Earth.

00:12:09.810 --> 00:12:11.746 position:16% line:89% align:start
Can you understand that?

00:12:13.248 --> 00:12:16.151 position:30% line:83% align:start
- You shouldn't
worry about winter.

00:12:18.486 --> 00:12:20.822 position:10% line:89% align:start
Not in the middle of summer!

00:12:30.532 --> 00:12:34.503 position:13% line:83% align:start
- [Narrator] The summer sun
smiled on Ronja and Birk.

00:12:34.536 --> 00:12:38.540 position:19% line:83% align:start
Every day seemed to be
more sweet than the last.

00:12:38.574 --> 00:12:41.678 position:21% line:89% align:start
(upbeat guitar music)

00:12:47.117 --> 00:12:49.485 position:38% line:89% align:start
(yelling)

00:12:50.921 --> 00:12:54.091 position:21% line:89% align:start
(upbeat guitar music)

00:13:16.681 --> 00:13:17.515 position:35% line:89% align:start
- Up I go.

00:13:21.152 --> 00:13:23.222 position:38% line:89% align:start
(laughs)

00:13:25.191 --> 00:13:28.560 position:21% line:89% align:start
(upbeat guitar music)

00:13:32.631 --> 00:13:33.666 position:44% line:89% align:start
Wow!

00:13:34.633 --> 00:13:37.603 position:21% line:89% align:start
(upbeat guitar music)

00:13:43.776 --> 00:13:46.246 position:27% line:83% align:start
Look, Birk, we're
the color of summer

00:13:46.279 --> 00:13:48.514 position:16% line:89% align:start
and I can't stop smiling.

00:13:49.582 --> 00:13:50.150 position:41% line:89% align:start
- Yes.

00:13:51.585 --> 00:13:55.655 position:16% line:83% align:start
But, if we drift all the
way down Greedy Falls,

00:13:55.689 --> 00:13:58.226 position:7% line:89% align:start
we won't be smiling any longer.

00:14:09.904 --> 00:14:11.339 position:27% line:89% align:start
- I have an idea.

00:14:11.372 --> 00:14:13.875 position:19% line:83% align:start
Let's see how close to
the falls we can get.

00:14:13.908 --> 00:14:15.810 position:7% line:89% align:start
As soon as you see Greedy Hump,

00:14:15.843 --> 00:14:16.944 position:30% line:89% align:start
swim like mad.

00:14:22.851 --> 00:14:24.086 position:30% line:89% align:start
- Time to jump.

00:14:48.211 --> 00:14:51.981 position:19% line:83% align:start
Good thing we both made
it back in one piece.

00:14:57.654 --> 00:15:01.392 position:24% line:83% align:start
- Yeah, we made it,
and I can't wait

00:15:01.425 --> 00:15:02.625 position:30% line:89% align:start
to do it again!

00:15:10.201 --> 00:15:12.937 position:27% line:89% align:start
(loud galloping)

00:15:41.767 --> 00:15:43.769 position:10% line:89% align:start
These lovely summer evenings,

00:15:43.803 --> 00:15:47.207 position:24% line:83% align:start
perfect for riding,
don't you think?

00:15:47.241 --> 00:15:50.277 position:21% line:89% align:start
(gentle flute music)

00:16:14.202 --> 00:16:16.337 position:21% line:83% align:start
I wish that it could
be summer all the time

00:16:16.371 --> 00:16:17.672 position:30% line:89% align:start
in the forest.

00:16:21.209 --> 00:16:26.748 position:13% line:83% align:start
Why does winter always come
and then spoil everything?

00:16:26.781 --> 00:16:27.749 position:30% line:89% align:start
- Sister mine,

00:16:29.485 --> 00:16:31.320 position:19% line:89% align:start
what are you thinking?

00:16:32.755 --> 00:16:35.791 position:27% line:83% align:start
- Oh, I was just
thinking that...

00:16:35.824 --> 00:16:37.359 position:10% line:89% align:start
How there must be murk trolls

00:16:37.393 --> 00:16:39.995 position:5% line:89% align:start
living under that enormous rock.

00:16:41.531 --> 00:16:43.400 position:19% line:89% align:start
There, past that grove.

00:16:44.833 --> 00:16:47.803 position:21% line:83% align:start
When I first ran away
to live in the forest,

00:16:47.836 --> 00:16:50.740 position:24% line:83% align:start
I saw them dancing
there on that rock.

00:16:51.908 --> 00:16:54.277 position:5% line:89% align:start
I like murk trolls and rumphops,

00:16:54.311 --> 00:16:56.780 position:21% line:89% align:start
but not gray dwarves,

00:16:56.813 --> 00:17:01.084 position:19% line:83% align:start
and not those horrible,
hateful wild harpies,

00:17:01.117 --> 00:17:03.154 position:16% line:89% align:start
I really don't like them.

00:17:05.990 --> 00:17:08.159 position:13% line:89% align:start
- And who would like them?

00:17:17.868 --> 00:17:21.839 position:16% line:83% align:start
- I've noticed the nights
are getting darker earlier.

00:17:25.844 --> 00:17:27.879 position:13% line:89% align:start
The stars are saying to us,

00:17:27.913 --> 00:17:30.349 position:16% line:89% align:start
"Soon it will be autumn."

00:17:30.382 --> 00:17:31.149 position:38% line:89% align:start
- Ronja.

00:17:38.124 --> 00:17:40.193 position:38% line:89% align:start
(laughs)

00:17:45.298 --> 00:17:49.168 position:19% line:83% align:start
- They say harpies are
even scarier in the Autumn,

00:17:49.202 --> 00:17:50.770 position:27% line:89% align:start
hungry and nasty.

00:17:52.473 --> 00:17:54.241 position:13% line:89% align:start
- Yeah, I know, but I think

00:17:54.275 --> 00:17:56.042 position:13% line:89% align:start
we'll be left in peace here

00:17:56.075 --> 00:18:00.914 position:19% line:83% align:start
because they don't know
about the bear's cave.

00:18:00.948 --> 00:18:02.983 position:33% line:83% align:start
- Really, you
think it's possible

00:18:03.017 --> 00:18:06.420 position:21% line:83% align:start
that the gray dwarves
kept quiet for once?

00:18:06.453 --> 00:18:08.389 position:27% line:83% align:start
- They must have,
otherwise the harpies

00:18:08.422 --> 00:18:10.858 position:7% line:89% align:start
would've come a long time ago.

00:18:14.895 --> 00:18:16.031 position:27% line:89% align:start
- Let's stop it.

00:18:16.064 --> 00:18:17.165 position:27% line:83% align:start
It's not good to
talk about them,

00:18:17.198 --> 00:18:19.934 position:16% line:89% align:start
we might bring them here.

00:18:19.968 --> 00:18:22.237 position:10% line:89% align:start
Don't even think about them.

00:18:37.420 --> 00:18:39.855 position:35% line:89% align:start
(laughing)

00:19:18.963 --> 00:19:21.165 position:33% line:89% align:start
(screeching)

00:19:24.436 --> 00:19:27.939 position:30% line:83% align:start
- Lovely little
humans in the water.

00:19:27.972 --> 00:19:29.006 position:33% line:89% align:start
Come sisters.

00:19:30.008 --> 00:19:32.311 position:13% line:89% align:start
Now there will be clawing,

00:19:32.344 --> 00:19:34.213 position:19% line:89% align:start
now the blood will run!

00:19:35.180 --> 00:19:37.316 position:30% line:89% align:start
- Ronja, dive!

00:19:37.349 --> 00:19:40.018 position:27% line:89% align:start
(dramatic music)

00:19:52.098 --> 00:19:56.102 position:19% line:83% align:start
- [Harpie] Where is the
lovely human with black hair?

00:19:56.136 --> 00:19:58.639 position:38% line:89% align:start
(cawing)

00:19:58.672 --> 00:20:02.175 position:24% line:83% align:start
Where is the lovely
human with red hair?

00:20:02.209 --> 00:20:05.045 position:38% line:89% align:start
(cawing)

00:20:05.079 --> 00:20:07.014 position:27% line:89% align:start
Now, come on out.

00:20:07.047 --> 00:20:09.583 position:33% line:89% align:start
(screeching)

00:20:09.617 --> 00:20:10.384 position:41% line:89% align:start
- Birk!

00:20:14.355 --> 00:20:19.661 position:13% line:89% align:start
Birk, where are you, Birk?

00:20:19.694 --> 00:20:20.695 position:30% line:89% align:start
Where are you?

00:20:22.230 --> 00:20:25.967 position:10% line:83% align:start
- [Harpie] There, the lovely
human with black hair!

00:20:26.001 --> 00:20:28.470 position:27% line:89% align:start
(dramatic music)

00:20:36.379 --> 00:20:38.980 position:33% line:89% align:start
(screeching)

00:20:42.418 --> 00:20:45.188 position:27% line:89% align:start
(dramatic music)

00:20:54.798 --> 00:20:56.366 position:24% line:89% align:start
- No need to hurry.

00:20:58.202 --> 00:21:00.404 position:7% line:89% align:start
Frighten them some more before

00:21:00.437 --> 00:21:03.073 position:7% line:89% align:start
we strike our claws into them.

00:21:05.777 --> 00:21:10.080 position:19% line:83% align:start
Torment them some more
before we tear them apart!

00:21:13.050 --> 00:21:15.085 position:30% line:89% align:start
- [Birk] Ronja!

00:21:15.118 --> 00:21:15.720 position:41% line:89% align:start
- Birk!

00:21:15.753 --> 00:21:17.288 position:24% line:89% align:start
- [Birk] Over here!

00:21:19.390 --> 00:21:21.226 position:19% line:89% align:start
- Birk, where are you?

00:21:22.527 --> 00:21:23.461 position:35% line:89% align:start
- I'm here!

00:21:25.631 --> 00:21:26.966 position:30% line:89% align:start
Come, come on!

00:21:28.501 --> 00:21:28.767 position:41% line:89% align:start
- Birk!

00:21:30.335 --> 00:21:35.474 position:19% line:83% align:start
- [Harpie] Where is the
lovely human with red hair?

00:21:35.508 --> 00:21:38.143 position:33% line:89% align:start
(screeching)

00:21:39.512 --> 00:21:42.281 position:27% line:89% align:start
(dramatic music)

00:21:52.225 --> 00:21:56.263 position:24% line:83% align:start
Where is the lovely
human with black hair?

00:21:56.296 --> 00:21:58.632 position:33% line:89% align:start
(screeching)

00:21:58.665 --> 00:22:00.166 position:41% line:89% align:start
- Birk,

00:22:00.200 --> 00:22:04.137 position:21% line:83% align:start
I thought, afraid, I
thought I'd lost you,

00:22:04.170 --> 00:22:06.172 position:21% line:89% align:start
I thought you jumped.

00:22:06.206 --> 00:22:06.774 position:35% line:89% align:start
- Not yet.

00:22:11.512 --> 00:22:13.281 position:19% line:89% align:start
But maybe soon, I will.

00:22:14.615 --> 00:22:17.718 position:16% line:83% align:start
- [Harpie] Where have the
lovely little humans gone?

00:22:19.320 --> 00:22:23.492 position:13% line:89% align:start
Ah, now the blood will run.

00:22:35.170 --> 00:22:36.305 position:27% line:83% align:start
- [Narrator] They
couldn't hear one another

00:22:36.338 --> 00:22:38.507 position:13% line:89% align:start
over the roar of the falls.

00:22:43.178 --> 00:22:44.347 position:30% line:89% align:start
"Sister mine."

00:22:47.650 --> 00:22:49.118 position:30% line:89% align:start
"Brother mine."

00:22:50.620 --> 00:22:51.788 position:16% line:89% align:start
Although neither of them

00:22:51.821 --> 00:22:53.690 position:24% line:89% align:start
could hear a word,

00:22:53.723 --> 00:22:56.159 position:16% line:89% align:start
they spoke to each other.

00:22:56.192 --> 00:22:57.728 position:13% line:89% align:start
They said what must be said

00:22:57.761 --> 00:22:59.597 position:19% line:89% align:start
before it was too late,

00:23:00.764 --> 00:23:03.834 position:24% line:83% align:start
how good it was to
love someone so much,

00:23:03.867 --> 00:23:06.270 position:16% line:89% align:start
there was no need to fear

00:23:06.303 --> 00:23:08.739 position:7% line:89% align:start
even the most difficult thing.

00:23:22.454 --> 00:23:25.557 position:24% line:83% align:start
Next time on Ronja,
the Robber's Daughter.

00:23:25.590 --> 00:23:28.326 position:30% line:89% align:start
(upbeat music)

00:23:30.562 --> 00:23:32.163 position:24% line:89% align:start
"Only This Summer".

00:23:33.799 --> 00:23:35.166 position:30% line:89% align:start
Don't miss it.

00:23:36.602 --> 00:23:39.839 position:19% line:89% align:start
(gentle playful music)
