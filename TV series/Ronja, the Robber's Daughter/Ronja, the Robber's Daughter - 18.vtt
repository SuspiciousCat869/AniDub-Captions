- [Ronja Voiceover] Lovis, I
am no longer Mattis' daughter.

00:01:41.997 --> 00:01:44.234 position:16% line:89% align:start
That's why I have to go.

00:01:45.703 --> 00:01:49.041 position:13% line:83% align:start
- [Narrator] When Ronja saw
Birk for the first time in days,

00:01:49.074 --> 00:01:51.479 position:27% line:83% align:start
he was moving out
of Borka's keep.

00:01:51.512 --> 00:01:54.684 position:21% line:83% align:start
Ronja decided to move
out of her home as well.

00:01:54.717 --> 00:01:56.185 position:13% line:89% align:start
In the middle of the night,

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:59.457 position:19% line:83% align:start
she quietly kissed her
sleeping mother farewell,

00:01:59.491 --> 00:02:02.928 position:19% line:83% align:start
then set out across the
forest to the bear's cave,

00:02:02.962 --> 00:02:05.365 position:19% line:89% align:start
where Birk was waiting.

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:08.136 position:27% line:89% align:start
(cheerful music)

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:13.511 position:21% line:89% align:start
(distant hooting owl)

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:21.255 position:16% line:89% align:start
(faintly crackling fire)

00:02:31.604 --> 00:02:35.543 position:21% line:83% align:start
When Ronja thought of
home, she couldn't sleep.

00:02:42.219 --> 00:02:46.992 position:19% line:83% align:start
It's the same stars and
moon over Mattis' fort,

00:02:47.026 --> 00:02:51.700 position:16% line:83% align:start
the same river rushing by
that she could hear back home.

00:02:51.733 --> 00:02:53.135 position:24% line:89% align:start
With that thought,

00:02:53.168 --> 00:02:56.740 position:21% line:83% align:start
she was finally able
to drift off to sleep.

00:03:03.217 --> 00:03:05.720 position:30% line:89% align:start
(blowing wind)

00:03:07.556 --> 00:03:10.060 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Birk shivering)

00:03:13.097 --> 00:03:15.133 position:7% line:89% align:start
I'm so cold, I'm turning blue.

00:03:16.603 --> 00:03:22.211 position:10% line:83% align:start
You know, dawn is the coldest
part of the day, and after,

00:03:22.245 --> 00:03:24.681 position:7% line:89% align:start
after that it gets much warmer.

00:03:25.817 --> 00:03:27.418 position:24% line:83% align:start
That's a comforting
thought, isn't it?

00:03:27.452 --> 00:03:31.157 position:35% line:89% align:start
(shivering)

00:03:31.191 --> 00:03:34.128 position:19% line:83% align:start
- Fire would bring more
comfort, don't you think?

00:03:34.161 --> 00:03:35.230 position:30% line:89% align:start
A nice big one.

00:03:37.867 --> 00:03:40.504 position:33% line:89% align:start
(clattering)

00:03:41.606 --> 00:03:43.776 position:38% line:89% align:start
(blowing)

00:03:45.211 --> 00:03:47.347 position:35% line:89% align:start
(crackling)

00:03:49.585 --> 00:03:50.419 position:44% line:89% align:start
Mmm?

00:03:55.126 --> 00:03:57.162 position:35% line:89% align:start
(sniffing)

00:04:02.202 --> 00:04:04.707 position:38% line:89% align:start

00:04:08.178 --> 00:04:09.246 position:38% line:89% align:start
(sighing)

00:04:09.279 --> 00:04:10.114 position:44% line:89% align:start
Mmm.

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:15.756 position:35% line:89% align:start
(gurgling)

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:21.598 position:27% line:89% align:start
(faint sloshing)

00:04:23.334 --> 00:04:26.237 position:35% line:89% align:start
(gurgling)

00:04:26.271 --> 00:04:27.807 position:47% line:89% align:start
Ah!

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:28.675 position:47% line:89% align:start
Ah.

00:04:29.911 --> 00:04:31.379 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmmm.

00:04:31.412 --> 00:04:33.882 position:21% line:83% align:start
From now on, we'll be
drinking spring water,

00:04:33.916 --> 00:04:35.250 position:27% line:89% align:start
or nothing else.

00:04:37.521 --> 00:04:41.193 position:13% line:83% align:start
- It won't make us fat, and
it won't kill us either.

00:04:41.226 --> 00:04:42.194 position:44% line:89% align:start
Ah...

00:04:43.429 --> 00:04:47.369 position:19% line:83% align:start
Or we could ask Mattis
to bring us some milk.

00:04:47.402 --> 00:04:49.639 position:35% line:89% align:start
(laughter)

00:04:51.976 --> 00:04:53.544 position:41% line:89% align:start
Ronja?

00:04:53.578 --> 00:04:54.713 position:41% line:89% align:start
- Huh?

00:04:54.747 --> 00:04:57.384 position:5% line:89% align:start
- Do you realize, that we can do

00:04:57.417 --> 00:05:01.623 position:10% line:83% align:start
whatever we want, whenever we
want, because now we're free?

00:05:01.657 --> 00:05:04.460 position:27% line:89% align:start
- Yes (laughing)!

00:05:08.667 --> 00:05:12.539 position:21% line:89% align:start
(surprised shouting)

00:05:12.572 --> 00:05:14.942 position:35% line:89% align:start
(grunting)

00:05:14.976 --> 00:05:17.346 position:10% line:89% align:start
(breathing hard and laughing)

00:05:17.379 --> 00:05:20.350 position:27% line:89% align:start
(majestic music)

00:05:23.021 --> 00:05:23.855 position:44% line:89% align:start
Aah!

00:05:41.481 --> 00:05:45.287 position:27% line:83% align:start
The forest is now
our kingdoooooom!

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:46.689 position:38% line:89% align:start
(echoing)

00:05:46.723 --> 00:05:49.393 position:5% line:89% align:start
No one can take it away from us!

00:05:50.561 --> 00:05:51.796 position:27% line:89% align:start
(plunking splash)

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:56.002 position:16% line:83% align:start
No one can drive us out!
(rapping)

00:06:01.745 --> 00:06:03.848 position:27% line:89% align:start
Cover your ears.

00:06:03.881 --> 00:06:05.684 position:13% line:89% align:start
Are you ready to hear this?

00:06:05.717 --> 00:06:07.787 position:16% line:89% align:start
My Spring Yell is coming!

00:06:09.455 --> 00:06:11.792 position:35% line:89% align:start
(chuckling)

00:06:13.461 --> 00:06:15.297 position:35% line:89% align:start
Aaaaaaa...

00:06:19.871 --> 00:06:22.674 position:27% line:89% align:start
(deep breathing)

00:06:22.708 --> 00:06:25.546 position:30% line:89% align:start
Aaaaaaaaaaaa...

00:06:35.995 --> 00:06:37.663 position:21% line:89% align:start
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!

00:06:45.108 --> 00:06:47.478 position:38% line:89% align:start
(echoing)

00:06:53.053 --> 00:06:56.124 position:21% line:83% align:start
- You know, I forgot
something really important.

00:06:56.157 --> 00:06:57.660 position:41% line:89% align:start
- Huh?

00:06:57.693 --> 00:06:59.595 position:27% line:83% align:start
- I must fetch my
bow and arrows,

00:06:59.628 --> 00:07:02.399 position:24% line:83% align:start
because we're gonna
need protection.

00:07:02.432 --> 00:07:06.139 position:16% line:83% align:start
Your Spring Yell is gonna
bring the harpies down on us.

00:07:06.172 --> 00:07:07.740 position:16% line:89% align:start
- Where are your things?

00:07:07.774 --> 00:07:08.809 position:35% line:89% align:start
They're...

00:07:08.843 --> 00:07:10.611 position:33% line:89% align:start
Borka's Keep.

00:07:10.644 --> 00:07:12.380 position:24% line:89% align:start
- (laughing) Oh no!

00:07:12.414 --> 00:07:14.952 position:10% line:89% align:start
They're hidden in the woods!

00:07:14.985 --> 00:07:17.889 position:27% line:83% align:start
Over there, in a
hollowed-out tree.

00:07:19.058 --> 00:07:21.962 position:24% line:83% align:start
I had all kinds of
bits and pieces,

00:07:21.995 --> 00:07:24.899 position:21% line:83% align:start
but I couldn't bring
everything with me at once,

00:07:24.932 --> 00:07:28.471 position:24% line:83% align:start
so it's down there,
with everything else.

00:07:28.504 --> 00:07:30.574 position:10% line:89% align:start
- Mattis said I was too young

00:07:30.608 --> 00:07:32.611 position:16% line:89% align:start
to have a bow and arrow.

00:07:34.446 --> 00:07:38.052 position:21% line:83% align:start
But what if I cut one
for myself from a tree?

00:07:38.086 --> 00:07:41.957 position:21% line:83% align:start
If you don't mind me
using your knife, that is?

00:07:41.991 --> 00:07:44.694 position:27% line:83% align:start
- Of course, but
you must be careful,

00:07:44.728 --> 00:07:45.997 position:30% line:89% align:start
not to lose it!

00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:52.473 position:19% line:83% align:start
That knife is the most
precious thing we have.

00:07:52.506 --> 00:07:56.478 position:10% line:83% align:start
Without it, we won't survive
out here in the woods.

00:07:58.015 --> 00:08:01.819 position:19% line:83% align:start
Hmm, you must remember
that, it's important.

00:08:01.853 --> 00:08:04.523 position:13% line:83% align:start
- I won't forget, but there
are other important things

00:08:04.556 --> 00:08:06.526 position:10% line:89% align:start
that we can't manage without.

00:08:06.559 --> 00:08:09.197 position:30% line:89% align:start
(plucky music)

00:08:09.231 --> 00:08:12.735 position:21% line:83% align:start
Like buckets to carry
all of our water.

00:08:12.769 --> 00:08:14.505 position:19% line:89% align:start
Did you think of that?

00:08:14.538 --> 00:08:16.241 position:35% line:89% align:start
(chuckling)

00:08:16.274 --> 00:08:18.244 position:27% line:83% align:start
- Of course I've
had that thought.

00:08:18.277 --> 00:08:22.250 position:24% line:83% align:start
But sadly only the
thought, not the bucket.

00:08:22.283 --> 00:08:24.687 position:30% line:83% align:start
- Then my dear
brother you are lucky,

00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:28.591 position:19% line:83% align:start
because I know exactly
where to get a bucket from.

00:08:28.625 --> 00:08:29.026 position:38% line:89% align:start
- Really?

00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:30.062 position:35% line:89% align:start
From where?

00:08:30.095 --> 00:08:32.698 position:21% line:83% align:start
- Down in the healing
spring that Lovis uses.

00:08:32.731 --> 00:08:35.069 position:13% line:89% align:start
Just below the Wolf's Neck.

00:08:35.102 --> 00:08:37.706 position:30% line:89% align:start
(plucky music)

00:08:41.544 --> 00:08:43.580 position:35% line:89% align:start
(grunting)

00:08:46.785 --> 00:08:49.122 position:35% line:89% align:start
(splashing)

00:08:51.659 --> 00:08:54.563 position:21% line:89% align:start
(distant screeching)

00:08:56.300 --> 00:08:58.702 position:33% line:89% align:start
(screeching)

00:08:59.771 --> 00:09:01.640 position:21% line:89% align:start
(vicious screeching)

00:09:01.674 --> 00:09:03.643 position:13% line:89% align:start
(screaming and whimpering)

00:09:03.677 --> 00:09:05.613 position:41% line:83% align:start
- Help!
(clattering)

00:09:05.646 --> 00:09:07.548 position:38% line:89% align:start
(panting)

00:09:07.582 --> 00:09:09.152 position:7% line:89% align:start
- Sturkas ended up coming home

00:09:09.185 --> 00:09:12.556 position:5% line:89% align:start
without the water or the bucket.

00:09:12.590 --> 00:09:14.259 position:35% line:89% align:start
(chuckling)

00:09:14.292 --> 00:09:17.331 position:16% line:83% align:start
But you can bet anything
Noddle-Pete will soon need water

00:09:17.364 --> 00:09:21.069 position:19% line:83% align:start
from the healing spring
for his weak stomach.

00:09:21.102 --> 00:09:23.606 position:19% line:83% align:start
Sturkas will be forced
to go back to the spring

00:09:23.639 --> 00:09:26.177 position:16% line:89% align:start
to find the lost bucket!

00:09:26.210 --> 00:09:29.048 position:16% line:83% align:start
Lovis is going to see to
that, I'm telling you.

00:09:29.081 --> 00:09:29.915 position:38% line:89% align:start
Trust me.

00:09:31.217 --> 00:09:33.988 position:21% line:83% align:start
- You mean, if we get
there before he does,

00:09:34.021 --> 00:09:35.857 position:24% line:89% align:start
the bucket is ours!

00:09:35.891 --> 00:09:39.062 position:7% line:89% align:start
- Yes, but we must hurry there.

00:09:39.096 --> 00:09:40.631 position:27% line:89% align:start
- [Both] Uh hmm.

00:09:44.637 --> 00:09:46.306 position:35% line:89% align:start
(crunching)

00:09:46.339 --> 00:09:47.140 position:35% line:89% align:start
- Come on!

00:09:47.174 --> 00:09:48.709 position:38% line:89% align:start
- Right!

00:09:48.743 --> 00:09:50.645 position:27% line:89% align:start
(cheerful music)

00:09:50.678 --> 00:09:55.386 position:38% line:83% align:start
(rapping)
(giggling)

00:09:55.419 --> 00:09:57.889 position:35% line:89% align:start
(giggling)

00:10:10.041 --> 00:10:12.277 position:35% line:89% align:start
(giggling)

00:10:26.831 --> 00:10:29.169 position:35% line:89% align:start
(chuckling)

00:10:34.476 --> 00:10:35.311 position:38% line:89% align:start
Perfect.

00:10:36.179 --> 00:10:38.949 position:27% line:89% align:start
(chirping birds)

00:10:43.089 --> 00:10:44.757 position:41% line:89% align:start
- Wow!

00:10:46.026 --> 00:10:47.929 position:24% line:83% align:start
Well I see you have
all the things we need

00:10:47.962 --> 00:10:49.832 position:10% line:89% align:start
to survive here in the woods!

00:10:49.865 --> 00:10:51.735 position:21% line:89% align:start
This is so exciting!

00:10:52.802 --> 00:10:54.272 position:21% line:89% align:start
Look at all of this!

00:10:56.742 --> 00:11:00.214 position:19% line:83% align:start
I promise, from now on
we will hunt and gather.

00:11:00.247 --> 00:11:03.986 position:21% line:83% align:start
And defend ourselves
from the wild harpies,

00:11:04.020 --> 00:11:06.957 position:27% line:83% align:start
and anything else
that might attack us.

00:11:06.990 --> 00:11:08.359 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmm!

00:11:08.393 --> 00:11:12.465 position:16% line:83% align:start
- What's more, one thing
I know for certain,

00:11:12.499 --> 00:11:13.867 position:35% line:89% align:start
(sniffing)

00:11:13.900 --> 00:11:16.904 position:27% line:83% align:start
is that you and I
will surely get-

00:11:16.939 --> 00:11:18.106 position:47% line:89% align:start
Oh!

00:11:18.140 --> 00:11:19.342 position:35% line:89% align:start
- Be quiet!

00:11:19.375 --> 00:11:21.445 position:27% line:83% align:start
There's something
moving inside our cave!

00:11:21.478 --> 00:11:24.450 position:7% line:89% align:start
(faint grunting and crunching)

00:11:24.483 --> 00:11:26.986 position:33% line:89% align:start
(tense music)

00:11:32.561 --> 00:11:35.399 position:27% line:89% align:start
(faint crunching)

00:11:46.515 --> 00:11:49.786 position:24% line:89% align:start
(suspenseful music)

00:11:49.820 --> 00:11:53.825 position:7% line:89% align:start
(faint rustling and crunching)

00:11:53.859 --> 00:11:55.528 position:13% line:89% align:start
- Come on out you harpies!

00:11:55.562 --> 00:11:57.365 position:7% line:89% align:start
Or do you want to feel the end

00:11:57.398 --> 00:11:59.434 position:21% line:83% align:start
of the sharpest spear
in all these woods?

00:11:59.468 --> 00:12:00.802 position:27% line:89% align:start
Now come on out!

00:12:01.837 --> 00:12:06.511 position:7% line:89% align:start
(faint rustling and crunching)

00:12:06.544 --> 00:12:09.548 position:24% line:89% align:start
(suspenseful music)

00:12:25.204 --> 00:12:28.276 position:16% line:83% align:start
(rustling and whispering)
Huh?

00:12:28.310 --> 00:12:32.482 position:33% line:83% align:start
(whispering)
(clattering)

00:12:39.025 --> 00:12:42.029 position:35% line:89% align:start
(grunting)

00:12:42.063 --> 00:12:45.568 position:16% line:89% align:start
(whispering and rustling)

00:12:48.105 --> 00:12:50.375 position:33% line:89% align:start
- [Both] Ahh!

00:13:01.191 --> 00:13:02.426 position:35% line:89% align:start
(growling)

00:13:02.460 --> 00:13:06.532 position:27% line:83% align:start
(chaotic rustling
and chattering)

00:13:08.234 --> 00:13:11.606 position:30% line:89% align:start
(comical music)

00:13:11.639 --> 00:13:15.144 position:16% line:89% align:start
(chattering and rustling)

00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:19.418 position:35% line:89% align:start
(splashing)

00:13:20.686 --> 00:13:23.557 position:30% line:89% align:start
(faint panting)

00:13:26.495 --> 00:13:29.899 position:16% line:89% align:start
(faint ragged breathing)

00:13:37.177 --> 00:13:40.047 position:35% line:89% align:start
(groaning)

00:13:40.081 --> 00:13:42.084 position:24% line:89% align:start
(distant splashing)

00:13:42.117 --> 00:13:44.988 position:30% line:89% align:start
(comical music)

00:13:49.629 --> 00:13:53.233 position:13% line:89% align:start
(chattering and splashing)

00:13:56.572 --> 00:14:00.711 position:16% line:83% align:start
- They're good swimmers,
those strange little beasts.

00:14:00.745 --> 00:14:02.280 position:16% line:89% align:start
- [Birk] Good eaters too.

00:14:02.313 --> 00:14:03.148 position:44% line:89% align:start
Look.

00:14:09.056 --> 00:14:11.026 position:38% line:89% align:start
(gasping)

00:14:17.202 --> 00:14:20.407 position:21% line:83% align:start
- All they've left is
this one loaf of bread.

00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:22.643 position:19% line:83% align:start
- I can't believe those
little gray dwarves

00:14:22.677 --> 00:14:25.414 position:33% line:83% align:start
ate that much
bread on their own.

00:14:27.150 --> 00:14:29.118 position:13% line:89% align:start
- This is not a good sign.

00:14:31.121 --> 00:14:34.093 position:13% line:83% align:start
The whole forest will hear
about our food from the dwarves,

00:14:34.126 --> 00:14:37.264 position:21% line:83% align:start
hissing and spitting
with their chatter.

00:14:37.297 --> 00:14:39.133 position:21% line:89% align:start
And then the harpies.

00:14:39.167 --> 00:14:41.170 position:7% line:89% align:start
They'll know where to find us,

00:14:41.203 --> 00:14:44.542 position:24% line:83% align:start
and the sky will be
full of their cries.

00:14:47.614 --> 00:14:52.621 position:19% line:83% align:start
Although, you must show
no fear in the forest.

00:14:52.654 --> 00:14:54.557 position:7% line:89% align:start
Mattis has been telling me that

00:14:54.590 --> 00:14:56.760 position:10% line:89% align:start
ever since I was very little.

00:14:56.793 --> 00:14:59.297 position:24% line:89% align:start
- Hmm, he's right.

00:14:59.330 --> 00:15:01.099 position:7% line:89% align:start
But that's not the only thing.

00:15:01.132 --> 00:15:04.304 position:16% line:83% align:start
We can't live in fear of
something that might not happen.

00:15:04.337 --> 00:15:05.372 position:41% line:89% align:start
- Yes.

00:15:05.406 --> 00:15:06.574 position:30% line:89% align:start
Exactly right.

00:15:07.843 --> 00:15:09.444 position:30% line:89% align:start
- So why worry?

00:15:09.478 --> 00:15:12.750 position:16% line:83% align:start
Let's see what things we
have, and also what we don't.

00:15:12.783 --> 00:15:13.818 position:38% line:89% align:start
- Great.

00:15:13.852 --> 00:15:15.554 position:27% line:83% align:start
And the things we
need we can gather

00:15:15.587 --> 00:15:18.392 position:19% line:83% align:start
from around the forest,
and in the river.

00:15:18.425 --> 00:15:22.598 position:21% line:83% align:start
(contemplative music)
(chirping birds)

(sloshing liquid)

00:16:05.761 --> 00:16:06.595 position:44% line:89% align:start
Aaah.

00:16:13.438 --> 00:16:15.608 position:38% line:89% align:start
(panting)

00:16:20.548 --> 00:16:22.786 position:35% line:89% align:start

00:17:19.469 --> 00:17:20.670 position:47% line:89% align:start
Oh?

00:17:20.703 --> 00:17:21.504 position:47% line:89% align:start
Ah!

00:17:21.538 --> 00:17:22.372 position:44% line:89% align:start
- Eh?

00:17:25.410 --> 00:17:27.379 position:33% line:83% align:start
- [Both] Hey!
(snorting)

00:17:27.413 --> 00:17:30.250 position:27% line:89% align:start
(pounding hooves)

Unh!
(clattering)

00:18:23.830 --> 00:18:25.431 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:18:25.464 --> 00:18:27.434 position:38% line:89% align:start

00:18:38.450 --> 00:18:39.085 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yeah!

(creaking bowstring)

00:18:50.134 --> 00:18:53.138 position:24% line:89% align:start
(fluttering-whoosh)

00:18:56.210 --> 00:18:57.778 position:33% line:89% align:start
Don't worry.

00:18:57.812 --> 00:19:00.415 position:10% line:89% align:start
Tomorrow I'll cut some more.

00:19:00.449 --> 00:19:01.618 position:47% line:89% align:start
Oh!

00:19:01.651 --> 00:19:03.888 position:27% line:89% align:start
(crackling fire)

00:19:03.921 --> 00:19:04.722 position:41% line:89% align:start

00:19:30.260 --> 00:19:34.799 position:24% line:83% align:start
Birk, I'll cut some
new arrows tomorrow.

00:19:34.832 --> 00:19:36.502 position:7% line:89% align:start
- Mmm hmm, that's great Ronja.

00:19:36.535 --> 00:19:40.675 position:10% line:83% align:start
But please remember, you need
to take care of the knife.

00:19:40.708 --> 00:19:42.244 position:33% line:89% align:start
- Yes I know.

00:19:42.277 --> 00:19:44.213 position:24% line:83% align:start
It's one of the two
most precious things

00:19:44.247 --> 00:19:47.518 position:24% line:83% align:start
that we have here,
the knife and the ax.

00:19:47.551 --> 00:19:51.524 position:21% line:83% align:start
I haven't forgotten,
don't worry (chuckling).

think that anyone

00:20:27.610 --> 00:20:31.082 position:27% line:83% align:start
is thinking about
us at all back home?

00:20:31.116 --> 00:20:31.950 position:41% line:89% align:start
Anyone?

00:20:33.252 --> 00:20:35.922 position:7% line:89% align:start
Are our parents worried at all?

It would be rather odd if
they didn't think about us.

00:20:53.081 --> 00:20:55.985 position:27% line:83% align:start
- I wonder mostly
if they're sorry.

00:20:58.188 --> 00:21:01.160 position:24% line:83% align:start
- I imagine they're
thinking about it.

00:21:01.193 --> 00:21:04.064 position:21% line:83% align:start
Undis will be sorry,
that's for sure.

00:21:04.097 --> 00:21:07.234 position:5% line:89% align:start
But also she'll be pretty angry.

00:21:07.269 --> 00:21:10.973 position:24% line:83% align:start
Borka will be angry
too, but underneath,

00:21:11.007 --> 00:21:14.245 position:21% line:83% align:start
I think he'll be sad
at the same time.

00:21:14.279 --> 00:21:16.614 position:19% line:89% align:start
- Lovis will be sorry.

00:21:16.648 --> 00:21:18.285 position:19% line:89% align:start
That much I'm sure of.

00:21:20.754 --> 00:21:22.391 position:21% line:89% align:start
- What about Mattis?

(blowing wind)

00:21:28.399 --> 00:21:31.736 position:21% line:83% align:start
- I would think that
he's quite pleased.

00:21:32.972 --> 00:21:36.978 position:21% line:83% align:start
Now that I'm gone, he
can forget all about me.

00:21:37.011 --> 00:21:39.615 position:30% line:89% align:start

(distant sobbing)

00:22:42.106 --> 00:22:42.907 position:41% line:89% align:start
- Huh?

00:22:42.941 --> 00:22:44.343 position:30% line:89% align:start
(eerie ringing)

00:22:44.376 --> 00:22:46.780 position:38% line:89% align:start

00:23:08.812 --> 00:23:12.818 position:24% line:83% align:start
(echoing, giggling,
and laughing)

00:23:21.297 --> 00:23:23.066 position:27% line:89% align:start

"The Lost Knife".

00:23:34.517 --> 00:23:36.352 position:30% line:89% align:start
Don't miss it!

00:23:36.387 --> 00:23:39.157 position:27% line:89% align:start
(cheerful music)
