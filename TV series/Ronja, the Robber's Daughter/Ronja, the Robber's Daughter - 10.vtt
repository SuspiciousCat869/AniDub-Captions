- Ahh!

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:44.619 position:16% line:83% align:start
- [Narrator] Winter came,
transforming Ronja's forest

00:01:44.652 --> 00:01:49.591 position:10% line:83% align:start
into an uncommonly beautiful
world of ice and snow.

00:01:49.624 --> 00:01:53.528 position:19% line:83% align:start
While out skiing, Ronja
jumped, lost a ski,

00:01:53.561 --> 00:01:55.597 position:7% line:89% align:start
and landed with her foot stuck

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:58.566 position:27% line:83% align:start
in the roof of a
family of rumphobs.

00:02:02.169 --> 00:02:04.672 position:24% line:89% align:start
- Help me! Help me!

00:02:14.549 --> 00:02:15.783 position:24% line:89% align:start
(Ronja struggling)

00:02:34.636 --> 00:02:36.136 position:38% line:89% align:start
(cheers)

00:02:36.169 --> 00:02:37.170 position:41% line:89% align:start
Weeee!

00:02:37.204 --> 00:02:38.138 position:33% line:89% align:start
Swing there!

00:02:39.707 --> 00:02:40.541 position:41% line:89% align:start
Weeee!

00:02:41.542 --> 00:02:44.578 position:27% line:83% align:start
- Little baby, he
hang good there.

00:02:45.546 --> 00:02:46.613 position:33% line:89% align:start
- I want to!

00:02:46.647 --> 00:02:48.181 position:24% line:89% align:start
Oh me, oh me swing!

00:02:50.551 --> 00:02:53.487 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Rumphobs cheer)

00:03:19.813 --> 00:03:21.415 position:41% line:89% align:start
- Snow.

00:03:21.448 --> 00:03:22.382 position:33% line:89% align:start
It's coming.

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:25.152 position:24% line:89% align:start
And when it does...

00:03:25.886 --> 00:03:29.489 position:19% line:89% align:start
(acoustic guitar music)

00:03:38.532 --> 00:03:41.702 position:21% line:89% align:start
(barely audible sigh)

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:50.109 position:38% line:89% align:start
- Ronja!

00:03:50.577 --> 00:03:52.111 position:41% line:89% align:start
Ronja!

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:55.247 position:41% line:89% align:start
Ronja!

00:04:00.252 --> 00:04:02.322 position:41% line:89% align:start
(music)

00:04:05.559 --> 00:04:06.860 position:41% line:89% align:start
Ronja!

00:04:09.863 --> 00:04:13.400 position:41% line:89% align:start
Noooo!

00:04:13.934 --> 00:04:16.603 position:30% line:89% align:start
(cries loudly)

00:04:23.242 --> 00:04:25.177 position:38% line:89% align:start
- Aahh!!

00:04:25.679 --> 00:04:26.847 position:38% line:89% align:start
Someone!

00:04:27.914 --> 00:04:30.651 position:41% line:89% align:start
Anyone!

00:04:31.718 --> 00:04:34.320 position:38% line:89% align:start
Help me!

00:04:45.832 --> 00:04:47.266 position:41% line:89% align:start
Anyone?

00:04:48.467 --> 00:04:49.803 position:27% line:89% align:start
Is anyone there?

00:04:50.804 --> 00:04:53.172 position:27% line:89% align:start
Help me, please!

00:04:54.741 --> 00:04:56.308 position:38% line:89% align:start
Help me!

00:04:57.811 --> 00:05:00.379 position:30% line:89% align:start
Please help me!

00:05:15.361 --> 00:05:17.530 position:13% line:89% align:start
- Uns stoppah rockin' now.

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:22.568 position:21% line:89% align:start
- Woffor did undo it?

00:05:36.882 --> 00:05:38.884 position:41% line:89% align:start
(gasps)

00:05:45.725 --> 00:05:48.761 position:27% line:89% align:start
(majestic music)

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:10.983 position:35% line:89% align:start
Ho, ho, ho!

00:06:13.552 --> 00:06:17.556 position:35% line:89% align:start
Ho, ho, ho!

00:06:18.691 --> 00:06:19.892 position:41% line:89% align:start
(gasp)

00:06:19.925 --> 00:06:21.460 position:44% line:89% align:start
- Ho!

00:06:32.104 --> 00:06:35.306 position:24% line:89% align:start
(whispering gasps)

00:07:12.878 --> 00:07:16.314 position:19% line:89% align:start
- Pretty little human.

00:07:17.883 --> 00:07:20.920 position:35% line:89% align:start
Ho, ho, ho.

00:07:25.991 --> 00:07:28.927 position:10% line:89% align:start
Here, you taking a rest then?

00:07:28.961 --> 00:07:30.929 position:19% line:89% align:start
Need a little lullaby?

00:07:44.776 --> 00:07:47.779 position:27% line:83% align:start
Oh, I hope you're
not just being lazy.

00:07:47.812 --> 00:07:51.649 position:19% line:83% align:start
There is so much to do
up in our mountain lair.

00:07:56.788 --> 00:07:59.023 position:24% line:83% align:start
You shall work for
me and my sisters

00:08:00.892 --> 00:08:03.461 position:16% line:89% align:start
high up in the mountains

00:08:03.494 --> 00:08:06.497 position:24% line:83% align:start
so you may know how
very kind we are!

00:08:10.134 --> 00:08:11.135 position:30% line:89% align:start
So listen now.

00:08:12.036 --> 00:08:14.372 position:10% line:89% align:start
You should be grateful, aye?

00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:19.510 position:27% line:83% align:start
Be a little more
cooperative, aye, aye?

00:08:39.998 --> 00:08:42.834 position:19% line:89% align:start
Oh why, why won't you?

00:08:42.867 --> 00:08:45.637 position:27% line:83% align:start
We won't scratch
or claw you much.

00:08:48.206 --> 00:08:49.040 position:41% line:89% align:start
- Huh!

00:08:56.948 --> 00:09:00.617 position:24% line:83% align:start
- Human, you are a
stubborn one, aren't you?

00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:24.808 position:24% line:83% align:start
All right, then you
simply stay here.

00:09:24.841 --> 00:09:28.947 position:7% line:83% align:start
And then my lovely sisters and
I will come back to get you.

00:09:31.082 --> 00:09:34.118 position:13% line:89% align:start
Oh yes, slumber peacefully.

00:09:34.152 --> 00:09:35.919 position:24% line:89% align:start
We'll come for you,

00:09:39.090 --> 00:09:42.260 position:13% line:83% align:start
and oh how we'll look after
you my sweet little one!

00:09:42.293 --> 00:09:44.062 position:19% line:89% align:start
So rest while you can,

00:09:50.801 --> 00:09:53.904 position:21% line:83% align:start
because you'll never
rest ever again!

00:09:55.206 --> 00:09:57.941 position:35% line:89% align:start
Ho! Ho! Ho!

00:10:06.016 --> 00:10:08.185 position:21% line:83% align:start
- Fine, go ahead and
bring your sisters.

00:10:08.218 --> 00:10:11.121 position:10% line:83% align:start
Tomorrow there'll be nothing
here but a lump of ice anyway!

00:10:11.154 --> 00:10:14.124 position:27% line:83% align:start
I hope you break
your teeth on me.

00:10:25.836 --> 00:10:28.005 position:38% line:89% align:start
(snoring)

00:10:41.018 --> 00:10:43.954 position:24% line:89% align:start
(slow piano music)

00:11:24.895 --> 00:11:27.663 position:30% line:83% align:start
I'll never see
any of them again.

00:11:33.136 --> 00:11:35.072 position:24% line:89% align:start
I love you mother.

00:11:35.105 --> 00:11:36.339 position:24% line:89% align:start
I love you father.

00:11:47.817 --> 00:11:49.219 position:27% line:89% align:start
- [Female] Ronja!

00:12:09.171 --> 00:12:11.173 position:41% line:89% align:start
(sighs)

00:12:15.010 --> 00:12:18.214 position:21% line:83% align:start
- I'm dreaming, there
is no one there.

00:12:18.247 --> 00:12:21.083 position:21% line:83% align:start
It's getting late and
soon it will be dark

00:12:21.117 --> 00:12:23.185 position:24% line:89% align:start
and it's all over.

00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:27.223 position:24% line:89% align:start
(slow piano music)

00:12:51.881 --> 00:12:56.352 position:24% line:83% align:start
- Ronja, shouldn't
you be going home now?

00:13:11.133 --> 00:13:13.135 position:41% line:89% align:start
(gasps)

00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:21.210 position:13% line:83% align:start
I just found your ski down
at the bottom of the hill

00:13:21.243 --> 00:13:24.813 position:21% line:83% align:start
so I figured you must
be up here somewhere.

00:13:24.847 --> 00:13:26.982 position:24% line:83% align:start
You've been sitting
like this all day?

00:13:27.016 --> 00:13:31.120 position:13% line:83% align:start
Maybe on a sunny day, sure,
but it's pretty cold out.

00:13:34.523 --> 00:13:38.227 position:21% line:83% align:start
Come on, it's time to
get you out of here.

00:13:41.330 --> 00:13:46.935 position:33% line:89% align:start
(loud cries)

00:14:00.316 --> 00:14:02.817 position:10% line:89% align:start
- Please don't ever leave me!

00:14:02.850 --> 00:14:04.819 position:16% line:89% align:start
Please do not ever leave!

00:14:09.225 --> 00:14:11.460 position:27% line:83% align:start
- Uh, alright, so
long as you keep

00:14:11.493 --> 00:14:14.062 position:10% line:89% align:start
a rope's length away from me.

00:14:16.931 --> 00:14:18.933 position:16% line:89% align:start
Now come on, stop crying.

00:14:18.967 --> 00:14:21.069 position:13% line:89% align:start
Why not let go of me, aye,

00:14:21.102 --> 00:14:23.405 position:13% line:83% align:start
and I'll have a try to see
if I can get you out of here.

00:14:23.439 --> 00:14:24.739 position:30% line:89% align:start
Alright Ronja?

00:14:34.082 --> 00:14:35.950 position:33% line:89% align:start
(wind blows)

00:14:35.984 --> 00:14:38.253 position:35% line:89% align:start
(whistling)

00:14:51.432 --> 00:14:55.169 position:33% line:89% align:start
Almost there.

00:14:57.238 --> 00:14:59.073 position:19% line:89% align:start
Ready? Try pulling it.

00:15:00.241 --> 00:15:02.343 position:38% line:89% align:start
(groans)

00:15:10.051 --> 00:15:12.053 position:41% line:89% align:start
(gasps)

00:15:14.289 --> 00:15:16.357 position:35% line:89% align:start
(laughing)

00:15:24.999 --> 00:15:27.435 position:33% line:89% align:start
(loud cries)

00:15:37.478 --> 00:15:40.048 position:7% line:89% align:start
You'll have to stop crying now.

00:15:40.081 --> 00:15:43.584 position:16% line:83% align:start
As nice as it is up here
I'd like to get home.

00:15:53.127 --> 00:15:56.997 position:7% line:89% align:start
- I won't cry anymore, I swear.

00:16:02.337 --> 00:16:04.938 position:10% line:89% align:start
- Now baby got dirt in eyes.

00:16:04.971 --> 00:16:05.540 position:38% line:89% align:start
Horrible.

00:16:07.108 --> 00:16:09.510 position:10% line:89% align:start
- Woffor, woffor did undo it?

00:16:11.679 --> 00:16:13.448 position:21% line:89% align:start
- Woffor did undo it?

00:16:15.483 --> 00:16:17.418 position:21% line:89% align:start
- Woffor did undo it?

00:16:18.653 --> 00:16:20.455 position:19% line:89% align:start
- Shh, hush hush baby.

00:16:20.488 --> 00:16:22.155 position:21% line:89% align:start
- Woffor did undo it.

00:16:22.189 --> 00:16:23.123 position:33% line:89% align:start
- Hush hush.

00:16:30.698 --> 00:16:31.532 position:41% line:89% align:start
- Well?

00:16:33.166 --> 00:16:34.267 position:33% line:89% align:start
- I think so.

00:16:34.301 --> 00:16:35.636 position:24% line:89% align:start
I'll give it a try.

00:16:43.478 --> 00:16:45.212 position:30% line:89% align:start
How about you?

00:16:45.245 --> 00:16:47.582 position:13% line:89% align:start
Aren't you coming with me?

00:16:47.615 --> 00:16:51.118 position:19% line:89% align:start
- Well of course I am.

00:16:53.554 --> 00:16:55.989 position:33% line:89% align:start
(slow music)

00:17:30.557 --> 00:17:32.993 position:35% line:89% align:start

00:18:03.690 --> 00:18:06.092 position:35% line:89% align:start
(whistles)

00:18:16.603 --> 00:18:18.638 position:35% line:89% align:start
(whistles)

00:18:57.777 --> 00:19:03.349 position:24% line:83% align:start
- Hey, listen Birk,
I've been thinking,

00:19:03.382 --> 00:19:07.687 position:13% line:83% align:start
and it may sound crazy, but
I wish you were my brother.

00:19:07.721 --> 00:19:08.688 position:41% line:89% align:start
- Huh?

00:19:11.390 --> 00:19:14.593 position:16% line:83% align:start
Why shouldn't I be then,
if that's what you like.

00:19:14.628 --> 00:19:16.262 position:24% line:89% align:start
Robber's daughter.

00:19:17.697 --> 00:19:21.233 position:30% line:83% align:start
- I'm serious,
that's what I want,

00:19:21.267 --> 00:19:26.372 position:24% line:83% align:start
but no, I want you
to call me Ronja

00:19:26.405 --> 00:19:28.207 position:5% line:89% align:start
and no longer Robber's daughter.

00:19:29.174 --> 00:19:30.676 position:38% line:89% align:start
(laughs)

00:19:32.711 --> 00:19:33.712 position:38% line:89% align:start
- Ronja.

00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:36.081 position:30% line:89% align:start
Sister of mine.

00:19:47.526 --> 00:19:50.429 position:24% line:89% align:start
(slow piano music)

00:20:21.760 --> 00:20:25.297 position:24% line:83% align:start
- Ronja, long time
out in the snow today.

00:20:25.331 --> 00:20:26.832 position:21% line:89% align:start
Well, did you go far?

00:20:29.702 --> 00:20:32.538 position:27% line:83% align:start
- Yes, and I had
a very nice time.

00:21:06.371 --> 00:21:11.376 position:19% line:83% align:start
- It's been ages since
we've had snow this bad,

00:21:11.409 --> 00:21:13.679 position:21% line:83% align:start
or perhaps we should
say this good.

00:21:13.712 --> 00:21:15.714 position:21% line:89% align:start
It's wonderful, aye?

00:21:15.748 --> 00:21:18.316 position:27% line:83% align:start
Specially if you
like shoveling snow,

00:21:18.349 --> 00:21:22.186 position:16% line:83% align:start
because I predict you're
gonna have great joy

00:21:22.220 --> 00:21:24.555 position:10% line:89% align:start
for quite some time now, hmm?

00:21:25.691 --> 00:21:27.592 position:7% line:89% align:start
- Well what'd you say that for?

00:21:27.625 --> 00:21:30.796 position:21% line:83% align:start
Nobody has great joy
from shoveling snow.

00:21:32.664 --> 00:21:33.698 position:27% line:89% align:start
- Enjoy the view.

00:21:33.732 --> 00:21:35.199 position:27% line:89% align:start
We'll dig later.

00:21:37.368 --> 00:21:39.671 position:33% line:89% align:start
(light music)

00:21:57.923 --> 00:22:01.292 position:24% line:83% align:start
- The snow can't be
that high, can it?

00:22:06.664 --> 00:22:07.699 position:30% line:89% align:start
- Are we stuck?

00:22:08.900 --> 00:22:11.569 position:7% line:89% align:start
- Never seen anything like it.

00:22:11.602 --> 00:22:12.837 position:24% line:89% align:start
- So we are stuck.

00:22:17.742 --> 00:22:21.579 position:19% line:83% align:start
- Alright my men, we'll
be inside for a while.

00:22:21.612 --> 00:22:24.916 position:24% line:83% align:start
- No one's getting
through Wolfneck Gap.

00:22:24.949 --> 00:22:27.652 position:5% line:89% align:start
- It's the same with Hell's Gap.

00:22:27.685 --> 00:22:30.788 position:5% line:89% align:start
- Alright then, as of right now,

00:22:30.822 --> 00:22:32.623 position:10% line:89% align:start
all look outs are cancelled.

00:22:33.725 --> 00:22:34.459 position:38% line:89% align:start
- No way!

00:22:35.493 --> 00:22:38.429 position:24% line:83% align:start
- See, I predicted
much joy to you.

00:22:40.631 --> 00:22:43.968 position:30% line:83% align:start
- And as for my
stupid enemy Borka,

00:22:44.001 --> 00:22:46.571 position:24% line:83% align:start
well even he's not
stupid enough to want to

00:22:46.604 --> 00:22:47.905 position:19% line:89% align:start
fight out in this snow.

00:22:47.939 --> 00:22:50.408 position:24% line:83% align:start
It's up to even his
armpits out there.

00:22:50.441 --> 00:22:51.809 position:13% line:89% align:start
- Maybe a snow ball fight.

00:22:51.843 --> 00:22:54.011 position:35% line:89% align:start
(laughing)

00:22:57.815 --> 00:22:59.817 position:24% line:89% align:start
(suspenseful music)

00:23:10.895 --> 00:23:11.829 position:41% line:89% align:start
(gasps)

00:23:11.863 --> 00:23:12.830 position:38% line:89% align:start
- Ronja!

00:23:22.607 --> 00:23:26.778 position:16% line:83% align:start
- [Narrator] Next time on
Ronja the Robber's Daughter,

00:23:29.080 --> 00:23:31.414 position:19% line:89% align:start
"To be Done in Secret".

00:23:33.885 --> 00:23:34.852 position:30% line:89% align:start
Don't miss it.

00:23:36.520 --> 00:23:38.823 position:33% line:89% align:start
(theme music)
