- [Narrator] Angered by Mattis'
cruel kidnapping of Birk,

00:01:41.322 --> 00:01:44.726 position:19% line:83% align:start
Ronja leapt over Hell's
Gap to offer herself

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:47.530 position:30% line:83% align:start
as a hostage to
the Borka Robbers.

00:01:54.638 --> 00:01:57.174 position:7% line:89% align:start
"I have no child," said Mattis,

00:01:57.942 --> 00:02:00.680 position:7% line:89% align:start
stunned by her act of defiance.

00:02:01.981 --> 00:02:06.920 position:19% line:83% align:start
His words filled Ronja
with an unbearable sorrow.

00:02:06.953 --> 00:02:09.824 position:27% line:83% align:start
She simply didn't
know what to do.

00:02:46.469 --> 00:02:50.907 position:7% line:83% align:start
For three days, Ronja went into
the forest looking for Birk,

00:02:50.941 --> 00:02:53.510 position:10% line:89% align:start
but there was no sign of him.

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:05.592 position:19% line:83% align:start
She wondered, had Borka
and Undis locked him in,

00:03:05.625 --> 00:03:09.730 position:16% line:83% align:start
so he couldn't run off to
the woods to be with her?

00:03:14.937 --> 00:03:21.411 position:10% line:83% align:start
It was frustrating, looking,
waiting, yet knowing nothing.

00:03:27.418 --> 00:03:29.922 position:7% line:89% align:start
- It's been four days already!

00:03:37.131 --> 00:03:37.965 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmph!

00:03:44.873 --> 00:03:48.378 position:21% line:83% align:start
Will you come and eat
some breakfast Mattis?

00:03:48.411 --> 00:03:49.579 position:33% line:89% align:start
Stop sulking!

00:03:50.948 --> 00:03:55.319 position:13% line:83% align:start
Everyone is sitting at that
table, waiting for you!

00:03:57.022 --> 00:03:58.523 position:24% line:89% align:start
Do you understand?

00:04:00.626 --> 00:04:02.895 position:35% line:89% align:start
(grunting)

00:05:12.014 --> 00:05:14.117 position:13% line:89% align:start
Well, have you had enough?

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:15.018 position:35% line:89% align:start
Say thanks.

00:05:16.886 --> 00:05:18.155 position:21% line:89% align:start
- What a hearty meal.

00:05:18.188 --> 00:05:19.089 position:30% line:89% align:start
- It sure was.

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:22.026 position:30% line:89% align:start
- Great dinner.

00:05:22.059 --> 00:05:23.627 position:24% line:89% align:start
- Thanks very much.

00:05:23.661 --> 00:05:24.796 position:19% line:89% align:start
- All right, let's go.

00:05:24.829 --> 00:05:25.764 position:33% line:89% align:start
- Wait, hey!

00:05:27.867 --> 00:05:29.035 position:30% line:89% align:start
Hey, don't go.

00:05:30.202 --> 00:05:31.570 position:30% line:89% align:start
I'll get them.

00:06:11.619 --> 00:06:16.259 position:21% line:83% align:start
- Even the horses are
itching to go out and run.

00:06:16.293 --> 00:06:18.562 position:16% line:89% align:start
- Still no robbing today.

00:06:23.101 --> 00:06:25.871 position:24% line:83% align:start
- Not when Chief's
in that state.

00:06:29.342 --> 00:06:31.277 position:13% line:89% align:start
- Even though it's spring,

00:06:31.311 --> 00:06:33.180 position:19% line:83% align:start
when we've got the most
amount of travellers

00:06:33.214 --> 00:06:35.515 position:13% line:89% align:start
passing through the woods.

00:06:38.686 --> 00:06:42.591 position:24% line:83% align:start
- All that treasure
just slipping by.

00:06:42.624 --> 00:06:43.793 position:30% line:89% align:start
- What a waste.

00:06:51.668 --> 00:06:54.305 position:10% line:89% align:start
- Well, you must be the band

00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:56.942 position:10% line:89% align:start
they call the Mattis Robbers,

00:06:56.976 --> 00:06:59.346 position:21% line:83% align:start
thought you were the
mightiest clan in the woods?

00:06:59.379 --> 00:07:00.947 position:38% line:89% align:start
- We are.

00:07:00.981 --> 00:07:04.017 position:24% line:83% align:start
But at the moment,
there's nothing we can do.

00:07:04.051 --> 00:07:08.257 position:13% line:83% align:start
- Carry on this way, we'll
all go mad, won't we?

00:07:08.290 --> 00:07:10.993 position:7% line:89% align:start
This is worse than last winter.

00:07:15.231 --> 00:07:17.801 position:5% line:89% align:start
- It's precisely times like now,

00:07:17.834 --> 00:07:19.703 position:30% line:83% align:start
when something
happens to the chief,

00:07:19.737 --> 00:07:23.208 position:21% line:83% align:start
we must pull together
and hold down the fort.

00:07:25.177 --> 00:07:27.046 position:33% line:89% align:start
- Well, sure.

00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:28.781 position:16% line:89% align:start
- I suppose you're right.

00:07:28.815 --> 00:07:30.183 position:16% line:89% align:start
- He's got his son back,

00:07:30.216 --> 00:07:33.220 position:27% line:83% align:start
so now who knows
what Borka will try.

00:07:34.788 --> 00:07:37.292 position:27% line:83% align:start
We must post more
guards than usual.

00:07:37.325 --> 00:07:39.228 position:21% line:83% align:start
Lill-Klippen, Tjegge
to Wolf's Neck!

00:07:39.261 --> 00:07:41.197 position:19% line:89% align:start
And inspect the traps!

00:07:42.164 --> 00:07:45.001 position:7% line:89% align:start
Fjosok, Sturkas, Jutis, Labbas.

00:07:45.035 --> 00:07:47.137 position:16% line:89% align:start
You are on rooftop duty!

00:07:47.170 --> 00:07:47.971 position:30% line:89% align:start
- [Group] Yes!

00:07:48.004 --> 00:07:50.074 position:19% line:89% align:start
- Tjorm, Pelje, Knotas.

00:07:50.108 --> 00:07:53.278 position:21% line:83% align:start
You men are to gather
all the weapons we have.

00:07:53.312 --> 00:07:54.379 position:21% line:89% align:start
- [Tjorm] I'm on it.

00:07:54.413 --> 00:07:55.314 position:21% line:89% align:start
- [Pelje] Right away.

00:07:55.347 --> 00:07:56.715 position:30% line:89% align:start
- [Knotas] Yes.

00:08:00.186 --> 00:08:01.654 position:41% line:89% align:start
- Birk!

00:08:04.191 --> 00:08:05.327 position:44% line:89% align:start
Birk!

00:08:10.165 --> 00:08:11.367 position:41% line:89% align:start
Hello?

00:08:17.074 --> 00:08:18.976 position:44% line:89% align:start
Birk!

00:09:01.328 --> 00:09:05.433 position:13% line:83% align:start
I remember when I was happy
to be on my own in the forest.

00:09:13.443 --> 00:09:15.145 position:33% line:89% align:start
How long ago.

00:09:15.178 --> 00:09:18.449 position:27% line:83% align:start
It all seems like
another lifetime away.

00:09:18.482 --> 00:09:22.387 position:16% line:83% align:start
Without Birk to share it
with there's no joy left.

00:09:32.433 --> 00:09:34.969 position:35% line:89% align:start
(whistling)

00:09:57.230 --> 00:09:58.064 position:44% line:89% align:start
Birk!

00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:07.943 position:35% line:89% align:start
Hey, Birk!

00:10:13.349 --> 00:10:14.518 position:16% line:89% align:start
- I'm finished with them.

00:10:14.551 --> 00:10:16.954 position:7% line:89% align:start
And I'm moving into the forest.

00:10:19.890 --> 00:10:24.130 position:19% line:83% align:start
I simply can't live in
Borka's Keep any longer.

00:10:24.163 --> 00:10:24.930 position:35% line:89% align:start
- Why not?

00:10:26.999 --> 00:10:28.402 position:24% line:89% align:start
- I can't stand it,

00:10:28.435 --> 00:10:30.437 position:24% line:83% align:start
I can't put up with
their cruel words

00:10:30.470 --> 00:10:32.373 position:13% line:89% align:start
and their nagging forever.

00:10:34.242 --> 00:10:36.077 position:19% line:89% align:start
Three days are enough!

00:10:43.887 --> 00:10:44.854 position:33% line:89% align:start
- Of course.

00:10:44.888 --> 00:10:45.955 position:33% line:89% align:start
You're right!

00:10:47.458 --> 00:10:50.395 position:27% line:83% align:start
Mattis remaining
silent is far worse

00:10:50.429 --> 00:10:52.497 position:10% line:89% align:start
than any of his harsh words.

00:10:53.433 --> 00:10:55.501 position:16% line:89% align:start
I can't stand it either.

00:10:55.535 --> 00:10:56.536 position:24% line:89% align:start
Where are we going?

00:10:56.569 --> 00:10:57.337 position:41% line:89% align:start
- Huh?

00:10:59.206 --> 00:11:01.442 position:19% line:89% align:start
- I'm coming with you!

00:11:01.475 --> 00:11:05.280 position:19% line:83% align:start
I'm going to move into
the forest as well!

00:11:05.313 --> 00:11:07.450 position:21% line:89% align:start
That's what I'll do!

00:11:07.483 --> 00:11:11.053 position:24% line:83% align:start
Yes, that's right,
I'll leave the fort!

00:11:12.556 --> 00:11:14.624 position:7% line:89% align:start
- Remember I was born out here.

00:11:14.659 --> 00:11:16.059 position:44% line:89% align:start
- So?

00:11:16.093 --> 00:11:17.362 position:27% line:83% align:start
- So I'm used to
living in a cave.

00:11:17.395 --> 00:11:18.229 position:35% line:89% align:start
- So what?

00:11:18.262 --> 00:11:20.965 position:24% line:83% align:start
- You really think
you can handle it?

00:11:20.998 --> 00:11:23.402 position:13% line:89% align:start
- If it's with you, I can!

00:11:23.435 --> 00:11:25.405 position:10% line:89% align:start
I know we can live anywhere!

00:11:25.438 --> 00:11:26.940 position:16% line:89% align:start
You know the Bear's Cave?

00:11:26.973 --> 00:11:29.242 position:13% line:89% align:start
Oh, we'd have a great time!

00:11:39.087 --> 00:11:42.125 position:7% line:89% align:start
- Ronja, watch where you step.

00:11:42.158 --> 00:11:44.595 position:7% line:89% align:start
Be careful you don't fall off.

00:11:46.163 --> 00:11:48.333 position:30% line:83% align:start
- You're always
worrying, Mattis.

00:11:48.366 --> 00:11:50.569 position:13% line:89% align:start
I promise you I won't fall.

00:11:58.545 --> 00:12:00.581 position:30% line:89% align:start
- Here we are.

00:12:00.615 --> 00:12:02.550 position:38% line:89% align:start
(gasping)

00:12:02.583 --> 00:12:05.086 position:41% line:89% align:start
- Wow!

00:12:14.298 --> 00:12:18.470 position:10% line:83% align:start
- I remember as a young boy,
I spent many summers here.

00:12:22.642 --> 00:12:23.342 position:41% line:89% align:start
- Wow.

00:12:24.243 --> 00:12:26.145 position:13% line:89% align:start
- According to Noddle-Pete,

00:12:26.179 --> 00:12:28.014 position:16% line:89% align:start
bears used to live here,

00:12:28.047 --> 00:12:30.685 position:24% line:83% align:start
so they'd hibernate
over the winter.

00:12:32.152 --> 00:12:35.524 position:19% line:83% align:start
And that's why I called
it the "Bear's Cave."

00:12:39.596 --> 00:12:42.332 position:24% line:83% align:start
- I'll come to the
Bear's Cave late tonight.

00:12:42.365 --> 00:12:44.234 position:19% line:89% align:start
Will you be there then?

00:12:46.070 --> 00:12:47.271 position:24% line:89% align:start
- [Birk] Of course.

00:12:47.305 --> 00:12:48.607 position:16% line:89% align:start
I've nowhere else to go.

00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:51.276 position:7% line:89% align:start
I'll be there waiting for you.

- My darling Lovis.

00:14:50.924 --> 00:14:54.661 position:24% line:83% align:start
Perhaps we will see
each other again.

00:14:54.694 --> 00:14:57.732 position:24% line:89% align:start
Or this is goodbye.

00:15:07.810 --> 00:15:12.650 position:24% line:83% align:start
But, Lovis, I am no
longer Mattis's daughter.

00:15:19.792 --> 00:15:22.662 position:16% line:89% align:start
That's why, I have to go.

00:15:25.565 --> 00:15:26.500 position:35% line:89% align:start
Forgive me.

00:15:35.779 --> 00:15:37.947 position:38% line:89% align:start
(snoring)

00:15:44.990 --> 00:15:45.824 position:44% line:89% align:start
- Hm?

00:16:13.958 --> 00:16:17.328 position:24% line:83% align:start
- You see, I really
have no choice.

00:16:17.361 --> 00:16:19.298 position:30% line:89% align:start
Be well, Joen.

00:16:30.846 --> 00:16:31.980 position:30% line:89% align:start
- Hey, wake up!

00:16:32.013 --> 00:16:34.851 position:19% line:89% align:start
- Ow, what's happened?

00:16:37.821 --> 00:16:38.655 position:41% line:89% align:start
Ronja!

00:16:43.628 --> 00:16:45.663 position:27% line:83% align:start
- In the name of
all wild harpies!

00:16:45.697 --> 00:16:46.966 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hey!

00:16:46.999 --> 00:16:50.703 position:19% line:83% align:start
Where are you off to in
the middle of the night?

00:16:56.878 --> 00:16:57.912 position:27% line:89% align:start
- Can't you see?

00:16:57.945 --> 00:16:58.646 position:38% line:89% align:start
I'm off.

00:16:58.679 --> 00:17:00.883 position:7% line:89% align:start
I'm going to live in the woods.

00:17:02.751 --> 00:17:05.722 position:10% line:89% align:start
One favor, tell Lovis for me.

00:17:06.923 --> 00:17:10.060 position:30% line:83% align:start
- Why don't you
tell her yourself?

00:17:10.094 --> 00:17:16.701 position:10% line:83% align:start
- Oh well, because if I tell
her, she wouldn't let me go.

00:17:16.735 --> 00:17:19.672 position:21% line:83% align:start
And I don't want her
to try and stop me.

00:17:19.705 --> 00:17:21.041 position:38% line:89% align:start
- Ronja!

00:17:21.074 --> 00:17:24.378 position:27% line:83% align:start
What do you think
your father will do?

00:17:26.114 --> 00:17:26.948 position:38% line:89% align:start
- Father.

00:17:29.818 --> 00:17:32.387 position:7% line:89% align:start
I'm sorry but I have no father.

00:17:37.127 --> 00:17:38.996 position:19% line:89% align:start
Give everyone my love.

00:17:39.030 --> 00:17:40.998 position:19% line:89% align:start
Especially Noddle-Pete.

00:17:42.500 --> 00:17:45.571 position:16% line:83% align:start
And remember me, perhaps,
when you're all dancing

00:17:45.604 --> 00:17:47.439 position:19% line:89% align:start
and singing your songs.

00:17:50.109 --> 00:17:54.849 position:16% line:83% align:start
- I think this is the end
of dancing in Mattis' Fort.

00:17:54.882 --> 00:17:57.651 position:30% line:83% align:start
- And who could
possibly sing now?

00:18:15.207 --> 00:18:17.109 position:41% line:89% align:start
Ronja!

00:18:17.142 --> 00:18:19.079 position:33% line:89% align:start
You can't go!

00:18:23.750 --> 00:18:27.956 position:19% line:83% align:start
- Be sure to tell Lovis
that she must not fret,

00:18:27.990 --> 00:18:29.958 position:13% line:89% align:start
or worry too much about me.

00:18:33.096 --> 00:18:37.968 position:19% line:83% align:start
I'll be in the woods if
she wants to find me.

00:18:38.002 --> 00:18:40.838 position:27% line:83% align:start
- And what do we
tell your father?

00:18:47.847 --> 00:18:49.415 position:35% line:89% align:start
- Nothing.

00:19:53.627 --> 00:20:00.769 position:13% line:83% align:start
How strange that I'm happy
and yet I feel so very sad.

00:20:35.979 --> 00:20:36.813 position:47% line:89% align:start
Oh.

00:20:48.395 --> 00:20:52.032 position:19% line:83% align:start
- The Murktrolls dance
only on moonlit nights.

00:20:56.104 --> 00:20:59.607 position:19% line:83% align:start
They sing their spring
song as they dance.

00:21:02.645 --> 00:21:03.814 position:30% line:89% align:start
- Spring song?

00:21:15.761 --> 00:21:16.662 position:35% line:89% align:start
- Old man.

00:21:16.695 --> 00:21:18.064 position:38% line:89% align:start
Old man!

00:21:18.098 --> 00:21:21.268 position:13% line:83% align:start
You dance like an earthworm
roasting on a fire.

00:21:23.070 --> 00:21:24.138 position:33% line:89% align:start
Look at that,

00:21:26.208 --> 00:21:27.976 position:24% line:89% align:start
fires are splendid.

00:21:30.746 --> 00:21:33.984 position:27% line:83% align:start
If nothing else,
Ronja, you remember...

00:21:35.719 --> 00:21:36.353 position:41% line:89% align:start
- Huh?

00:22:12.498 --> 00:22:15.434 position:21% line:83% align:start
- [Mattis] If nothing
else, Ronja, you remember-

00:22:15.468 --> 00:22:19.239 position:16% line:83% align:start
- Where there is a home,
there is a warm fire.

00:22:23.878 --> 00:22:28.050 position:16% line:83% align:start
And where there is a warm
fire there can also be a home

00:22:51.946 --> 00:22:56.452 position:16% line:83% align:start
- I've been waiting here
a long time for you.

00:22:56.485 --> 00:22:58.019 position:38% line:89% align:start
Now eat.

00:22:58.054 --> 00:23:02.159 position:13% line:83% align:start
Then, sister mine, you can
sing the Wolf Song for us.

00:23:22.850 --> 00:23:27.022 position:16% line:83% align:start
- [Narrator] Next time on
Ronja, the Robber's Daughter.

00:23:30.860 --> 00:23:32.496 position:16% line:89% align:start
"Something in the Cave".

00:23:33.998 --> 00:23:35.165 position:30% line:89% align:start
Don't miss it.

00:23:37.001 --> 00:23:39.471 position:30% line:89% align:start
(upbeat music)
