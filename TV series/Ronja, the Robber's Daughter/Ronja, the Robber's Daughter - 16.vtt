- Birk, what's gonna happen?

00:01:41.609 --> 00:01:43.579 position:16% line:83% align:start
- [Narrator] As the clash
between Mattis and Borka

00:01:43.612 --> 00:01:46.284 position:5% line:89% align:start
grew more intense, Ronja worried

00:01:46.317 --> 00:01:48.453 position:10% line:89% align:start
about what might happen next.

00:01:49.856 --> 00:01:52.427 position:27% line:83% align:start
Then she returned
home from the forest

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:57.303 position:13% line:83% align:start
to the awful sight of Birk,
who was captured by Mattis.

00:01:57.336 --> 00:01:59.105 position:19% line:89% align:start
I hate you, she cried.

00:02:00.274 --> 00:02:03.146 position:19% line:83% align:start
Ronja had always loved
her father dearly,

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:05.517 position:7% line:89% align:start
but now she only despised him.

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:07.887 position:33% line:89% align:start
(soft music)

00:02:09.356 --> 00:02:11.493 position:41% line:89% align:start
Mattis!

00:02:32.196 --> 00:02:33.431 position:27% line:89% align:start
- Here they come.

00:02:33.465 --> 00:02:35.534 position:35% line:89% align:start
(footsteps)

00:02:38.206 --> 00:02:40.209 position:41% line:89% align:start

00:02:45.719 --> 00:02:46.620 position:35% line:89% align:start
(cries out)

00:02:46.653 --> 00:02:48.223 position:38% line:89% align:start
- My boy!

00:03:23.717 --> 00:03:25.987 position:38% line:89% align:start
(grunts)

00:03:27.089 --> 00:03:29.694 position:24% line:89% align:start

(footsteps)

00:04:25.658 --> 00:04:26.525 position:41% line:89% align:start
- Birk!

00:04:26.559 --> 00:04:28.395 position:19% line:89% align:start
Birk, are you alright?!

00:04:32.235 --> 00:04:35.641 position:21% line:83% align:start
Mattis, you good for
nothing dirty beast!

00:04:36.843 --> 00:04:40.249 position:27% line:83% align:start
Bring my son back
here this instant

00:04:40.282 --> 00:04:45.157 position:13% line:83% align:start
or I'll tear off your legs
and rip out your eyes!

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:47.394 position:7% line:89% align:start
Do you hear me, you scoundrel?!

00:04:47.428 --> 00:04:50.299 position:24% line:83% align:start
Do you have nothing
to say for yourself?

00:04:50.333 --> 00:04:53.539 position:21% line:83% align:start
Or is it that you're
so ashamed of yourself,

00:04:53.572 --> 00:04:55.809 position:21% line:89% align:start
you can't even speak?

00:04:55.843 --> 00:04:56.644 position:41% line:89% align:start
Well?!

00:04:56.677 --> 00:04:59.247 position:19% line:89% align:start
Say something, Mattis!

00:04:59.281 --> 00:05:01.653 position:7% line:89% align:start
- Tell her to be quiet, Borka.

00:05:02.888 --> 00:05:05.192 position:19% line:83% align:start
It would be better for
everyone if you listened

00:05:05.225 --> 00:05:08.865 position:16% line:83% align:start
to what I have to say and
keep your woman out of this.

00:05:08.898 --> 00:05:13.271 position:24% line:83% align:start
- Why are you just
standing there, Borka?

00:05:13.306 --> 00:05:15.744 position:10% line:89% align:start
Why don't you say something?!

00:05:17.981 --> 00:05:21.487 position:27% line:83% align:start
- You must have a
heart of stone, Mattis.

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:22.856 position:33% line:89% align:start
- Hey, stop!

00:05:22.889 --> 00:05:24.960 position:19% line:89% align:start
Get your hands off me!

00:05:24.993 --> 00:05:27.463 position:21% line:89% align:start
- You're a vile man.

00:05:27.497 --> 00:05:29.601 position:21% line:83% align:start
I can understand that
you want me out of here,

00:05:29.634 --> 00:05:34.676 position:19% line:83% align:start
but you must understand
that's my son,

00:05:34.709 --> 00:05:38.482 position:21% line:83% align:start
my child who you used
to get what you want.

00:05:38.516 --> 00:05:40.720 position:13% line:89% align:start
Have you no sense of shame?

00:05:41.955 --> 00:05:45.294 position:24% line:83% align:start
- I didn't ask what
you think of me.

00:05:45.327 --> 00:05:47.230 position:7% line:89% align:start
What I want to know is how soon

00:05:47.264 --> 00:05:50.003 position:27% line:83% align:start
you'll be getting
out of my fort.

00:05:50.036 --> 00:05:52.273 position:38% line:89% align:start
(growls)

00:05:52.306 --> 00:05:54.209 position:38% line:89% align:start
(seethes)

00:06:04.293 --> 00:06:06.597 position:19% line:83% align:start
- First I have to find
a place in the forest

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:09.803 position:5% line:89% align:start
where we can stay out of danger,

00:06:09.837 --> 00:06:12.942 position:24% line:83% align:start
but that may prove
difficult for us.

00:06:12.975 --> 00:06:16.347 position:19% line:83% align:start
That said, give me back
my son and I promise

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:20.889 position:21% line:83% align:start
that we will be gone
before the summer is over.

00:06:20.922 --> 00:06:22.257 position:27% line:89% align:start
You have my word.

00:06:23.459 --> 00:06:24.628 position:30% line:89% align:start
- Sounds good.

00:06:26.065 --> 00:06:29.704 position:13% line:83% align:start
Then I in turn promise that
you will get your son back

00:06:29.737 --> 00:06:31.841 position:13% line:89% align:start
before the summer is over.

00:06:33.577 --> 00:06:38.519 position:24% line:83% align:start
- I meant, Mattis,
that I want my son back

00:06:38.552 --> 00:06:39.454 position:35% line:89% align:start
right now.

00:06:40.556 --> 00:06:44.096 position:30% line:83% align:start
- Well then you
better go right now.

00:06:44.129 --> 00:06:45.531 position:38% line:89% align:start
(growls)

00:06:45.564 --> 00:06:47.333 position:33% line:89% align:start
- You animal!

00:06:47.367 --> 00:06:50.740 position:24% line:83% align:start
I hope the harpies
rip ya to pieces!

00:06:50.773 --> 00:06:52.476 position:41% line:89% align:start
(gasps)

00:06:53.979 --> 00:06:59.856 position:10% line:83% align:start
- Bet ya know, Borka, we have
dungeons here in Mattis' fort.

00:06:59.889 --> 00:07:02.794 position:19% line:83% align:start
Your son won't want for
a roof over his head

00:07:02.828 --> 00:07:05.032 position:21% line:89% align:start
or food on his plate,

00:07:05.065 --> 00:07:08.436 position:7% line:89% align:start
so let that be a comfort to you

00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:11.642 position:24% line:83% align:start
if it happens to be
a cold, wet summer.

00:07:14.047 --> 00:07:16.550 position:33% line:89% align:start
(water drips)

00:07:29.807 --> 00:07:32.044 position:35% line:89% align:start
(sniffles)

00:07:34.115 --> 00:07:37.654 position:30% line:83% align:start
- I should just
destroy everything

00:07:37.687 --> 00:07:41.493 position:27% line:83% align:start
then Mattis will
know how I suffer.

00:07:41.526 --> 00:07:44.032 position:33% line:89% align:start
(water drips)

00:07:52.213 --> 00:07:54.583 position:38% line:89% align:start
(dinging)

00:08:02.664 --> 00:08:04.935 position:35% line:89% align:start
(whistling)

00:08:13.616 --> 00:08:15.919 position:16% line:89% align:start
- What's wrong with you?

00:08:15.954 --> 00:08:18.157 position:21% line:89% align:start
Don't you feel well?

00:08:18.190 --> 00:08:20.127 position:41% line:89% align:start
(gasps)

00:08:21.930 --> 00:08:24.000 position:38% line:89% align:start
(laughs)

00:08:27.306 --> 00:08:29.911 position:19% line:89% align:start
Don't you want to play?

00:08:29.944 --> 00:08:31.714 position:19% line:89% align:start
Here, watch once more.

00:08:33.850 --> 00:08:35.619 position:41% line:89% align:start
(gasps)

00:08:35.653 --> 00:08:37.290 position:35% line:89% align:start
Beat that!

00:08:37.323 --> 00:08:38.158 position:35% line:89% align:start
If you can.

00:08:45.838 --> 00:08:48.275 position:41% line:89% align:start
(sighs)

00:08:48.309 --> 00:08:51.180 position:27% line:89% align:start
(dramatic music)

00:08:53.351 --> 00:08:55.554 position:41% line:89% align:start
(gasps)

00:08:57.190 --> 00:08:59.261 position:38% line:89% align:start
(grunts)

00:09:04.904 --> 00:09:07.175 position:35% line:89% align:start
(wooshing)

00:09:17.959 --> 00:09:20.230 position:35% line:89% align:start
(rumbling)

00:09:34.321 --> 00:09:36.292 position:38% line:89% align:start
(gasping)

00:09:53.821 --> 00:09:55.824 position:41% line:89% align:start
(gasps)

00:09:57.228 --> 00:09:58.363 position:35% line:89% align:start
(grunting)

00:09:58.396 --> 00:10:00.666 position:41% line:89% align:start
(gasps)

00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:04.907 position:21% line:83% align:start
- You're not the only
people who have dungeons.

00:10:04.940 --> 00:10:08.179 position:16% line:83% align:start
So your daughter will not
want for a roof over her head

00:10:08.213 --> 00:10:10.950 position:10% line:89% align:start
or food on her plate either.

00:10:10.984 --> 00:10:14.690 position:21% line:83% align:start
Comfort yourself with
that thought, Mattis.

00:10:19.466 --> 00:10:23.105 position:19% line:83% align:start
- Yes, cry, I would do
the same if I had a beast

00:10:23.138 --> 00:10:25.376 position:7% line:89% align:start
like that Mattis as my father.

00:10:26.411 --> 00:10:28.948 position:10% line:89% align:start
- I'm warning you, be quiet.

00:10:30.451 --> 00:10:32.888 position:7% line:89% align:start
You will not interfere in this.

00:10:32.922 --> 00:10:33.722 position:38% line:89% align:start
(scoffs)

00:10:33.756 --> 00:10:34.824 position:30% line:89% align:start
- How dare you!

00:10:34.858 --> 00:10:37.397 position:30% line:89% align:start
(woman grunts)

00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:45.977 position:35% line:89% align:start
(footsteps)

00:10:57.497 --> 00:10:59.968 position:10% line:89% align:start
- Do you hear that, ya fool?

00:11:00.002 --> 00:11:03.074 position:24% line:83% align:start
If you want to see
your daughter again,

00:11:03.107 --> 00:11:05.411 position:10% line:89% align:start
you will return my son to me!

00:11:11.955 --> 00:11:15.795 position:19% line:83% align:start
Mattis, will you bring
my son back over here

00:11:15.829 --> 00:11:19.402 position:24% line:83% align:start
or do I throw your
daughter into our dungeon?

00:11:19.435 --> 00:11:25.312 position:19% line:83% align:start
- You can have your son
back whenever you want.

00:11:25.345 --> 00:11:27.248 position:24% line:89% align:start
- Whenever I want?

00:11:27.282 --> 00:11:29.819 position:24% line:83% align:start
Shall we wait 'til
summer is over?

00:11:29.853 --> 00:11:30.955 position:30% line:89% align:start
You want that?

00:11:34.461 --> 00:11:36.131 position:21% line:89% align:start
- Whenever you want.

00:11:38.602 --> 00:11:43.209 position:19% line:83% align:start
- Look, I am merciful,
not a scoundrel,

00:11:43.243 --> 00:11:45.981 position:30% line:83% align:start
I'll do a fair
exchange with you.

Hiding under a rock somewhere?
