- Hey, robber's daughter.

00:01:42.721 --> 00:01:44.422 position:21% line:89% align:start
I know you, yes I do.

00:01:45.691 --> 00:01:49.326 position:16% line:83% align:start
- And I know we're gonna
throw you off this earth.

00:01:49.361 --> 00:01:51.697 position:19% line:83% align:start
- [Narrator] In all her
years, Ronja had never met

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:54.566 position:21% line:83% align:start
another child in the
forest, and then suddenly,

00:01:54.599 --> 00:01:57.402 position:21% line:83% align:start
she found Birk, right
on top of the fort

00:01:57.436 --> 00:01:59.805 position:19% line:83% align:start
across the treacherous
Hell's Gap.

00:01:59.838 --> 00:02:03.442 position:10% line:83% align:start
He was the son of Borka, her
father's most hated rival,

00:02:03.475 --> 00:02:05.844 position:24% line:83% align:start
and to make matters
worse, his whole family

00:02:05.878 --> 00:02:07.713 position:19% line:89% align:start
had moved in next door.

00:02:25.631 --> 00:02:28.501 position:30% line:89% align:start
(fire crackles)

00:03:07.775 --> 00:03:10.377 position:33% line:89% align:start
(wind howls)

00:03:33.668 --> 00:03:35.804 position:19% line:89% align:start
- Hey, wake up, Tjegge.

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:41.609 position:24% line:83% align:start
- (grumbles) Is it
my time to take over?

00:03:41.643 --> 00:03:43.645 position:27% line:89% align:start
- Huh, ages ago.

00:03:43.678 --> 00:03:45.446 position:13% line:89% align:start
Why were you sleeping, eh?

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:47.382 position:16% line:83% align:start
The whole point of guard
duty is to be on guard.

00:03:47.415 --> 00:03:48.851 position:21% line:83% align:start
- [Tjegge] I was just
resting me eyelids.

00:03:48.884 --> 00:03:50.652 position:16% line:89% align:start
- Also known as sleeping!

00:03:50.685 --> 00:03:51.954 position:13% line:89% align:start
- [Tjegge] Yeah, yeah, yeah

00:03:51.987 --> 00:03:53.622 position:24% line:89% align:start
- Oh, just get up.

00:03:54.556 --> 00:03:56.559 position:41% line:89% align:start
(gasps)

00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:58.994 position:27% line:83% align:start
- [Tjegge] I said
I wasn't sleeping.

00:03:59.028 --> 00:04:01.797 position:30% line:83% align:start
- Oy, there are
people over there.

00:04:18.181 --> 00:04:21.717 position:19% line:89% align:start
Chief, Chief (panting).

00:04:23.153 --> 00:04:25.055 position:30% line:89% align:start
We got trouble.

00:04:25.088 --> 00:04:26.756 position:27% line:89% align:start
Borka wants you.

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:27.958 position:5% line:89% align:start
He says he wants to talk to you.

00:04:27.991 --> 00:04:30.459 position:10% line:89% align:start
He's waitin' up on the roof.

00:04:35.131 --> 00:04:37.734 position:30% line:89% align:start
(bowl rattles)

00:04:40.804 --> 00:04:41.838 position:10% line:89% align:start
- You do know you're going to

00:04:41.872 --> 00:04:44.507 position:7% line:89% align:start
have to clean that up yourself.

00:04:46.077 --> 00:04:48.945 position:21% line:83% align:start
- Borka wants to talk
to me, is that so?

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:52.382 position:24% line:83% align:start
How dare he send me
a message like this?

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:57.154 position:16% line:83% align:start
Oh sure, I'll go talk to
him, I can hardly wait.

00:04:57.188 --> 00:05:01.491 position:21% line:83% align:start
And then he'll never
speak again (growls)!

00:05:04.195 --> 00:05:05.196 position:21% line:89% align:start
- Are you all right?

00:05:05.229 --> 00:05:07.031 position:24% line:89% align:start
We heard shouting.

00:05:07.064 --> 00:05:08.132 position:27% line:89% align:start
- What happened?

00:05:09.734 --> 00:05:14.639 position:7% line:83% align:start
- All right, eat up and gather
your strength, gentlemen.

00:05:14.672 --> 00:05:17.808 position:24% line:83% align:start
I want to take this
bull by the horns,

00:05:17.842 --> 00:05:22.948 position:24% line:83% align:start
and we will finally
put an end to Borka.

00:05:22.981 --> 00:05:26.051 position:30% line:89% align:start
(uptempo music)

00:05:26.084 --> 00:05:28.787 position:30% line:89% align:start
(all slurping)

00:05:35.861 --> 00:05:37.963 position:38% line:89% align:start
(grunts)

00:05:55.747 --> 00:05:59.085 position:13% line:83% align:start
- (sighs) That's the worst
part about gettin' old.

00:05:59.118 --> 00:06:02.021 position:27% line:83% align:start
Don't get to join
in any of the fun.

00:06:02.055 --> 00:06:04.891 position:24% line:83% align:start
No matter, too many
stairs, anyway.

00:07:00.181 --> 00:07:02.117 position:19% line:83% align:start
- Borka's robbers don't
look so scary to me,

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:04.019 position:7% line:89% align:start
I mean, what are we up against?

00:07:04.052 --> 00:07:06.720 position:30% line:83% align:start
They don't look
like much at all.

00:07:06.754 --> 00:07:10.058 position:13% line:89% align:start
But, oh (sucks in breath).

00:07:12.827 --> 00:07:15.562 position:27% line:89% align:start
(majestic music)

00:07:22.237 --> 00:07:23.772 position:27% line:89% align:start
So that's Borka.

00:07:32.781 --> 00:07:34.949 position:38% line:89% align:start
(giggles)

00:07:37.886 --> 00:07:42.557 position:19% line:83% align:start
(gasping and grunting)
That dog.

00:07:48.264 --> 00:07:49.965 position:19% line:89% align:start
- Good morning, Mattis.

00:07:49.999 --> 00:07:54.003 position:19% line:83% align:start
Thank you very much for
coming up here so quickly.

00:07:54.036 --> 00:07:58.040 position:16% line:83% align:start
Well, and a good morning
to you, too, Borka.

00:07:58.074 --> 00:08:00.810 position:7% line:89% align:start
I would have come here sooner,

00:08:00.843 --> 00:08:02.978 position:5% line:89% align:start
but I had something to do first.

00:08:03.012 --> 00:08:08.218 position:10% line:83% align:start
I was composing a poem called
Lament for a Dead Borka.

00:08:08.251 --> 00:08:11.988 position:16% line:83% align:start
Maybe I will read it out
to your poor widow Undis

00:08:12.022 --> 00:08:13.356 position:16% line:89% align:start
after we have thrown you

00:08:13.390 --> 00:08:17.127 position:16% line:83% align:start
and your lamentable crew
into the abyss (laughs).

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:20.097 position:10% line:83% align:start
She might at least get a bit
of comfort from the poem.

00:08:20.130 --> 00:08:23.900 position:10% line:89% align:start
(Ronja and Mattis' men laugh)

00:08:25.802 --> 00:08:27.971 position:19% line:89% align:start
- Oh, that is classic.

00:08:28.004 --> 00:08:31.342 position:27% line:83% align:start
- Yeah, but would
Undis ever read a poem?

00:08:31.375 --> 00:08:33.277 position:21% line:83% align:start
- [Borka's Man] True,
Borka's wife wouldn't have

00:08:33.311 --> 00:08:35.612 position:13% line:89% align:start
such a fancy little hobby.

00:08:36.347 --> 00:08:38.249 position:19% line:89% align:start
- I'll give 'em a poem.

00:08:40.451 --> 00:08:43.421 position:10% line:83% align:start
What, I told you, they simply
won't listen to reason.

00:08:43.454 --> 00:08:46.157 position:19% line:83% align:start
We're wasting our time
here with these animals.

00:08:46.190 --> 00:08:48.725 position:10% line:89% align:start
Are you even listening to me?

00:08:50.228 --> 00:08:52.230 position:16% line:89% align:start
- It seems you're right.

00:08:55.099 --> 00:08:56.100 position:33% line:89% align:start
Hey, Mattis.

00:08:57.034 --> 00:08:57.869 position:44% line:89% align:start
- Hm?

00:08:58.803 --> 00:09:01.105 position:10% line:89% align:start
- Before you worry about us,

00:09:01.139 --> 00:09:04.343 position:13% line:83% align:start
you should be thinking more
about comforting Lovis.

00:09:04.376 --> 00:09:05.109 position:41% line:89% align:start
- Why?

00:09:06.010 --> 00:09:08.146 position:13% line:89% align:start
- Lovis has the worst deal.

00:09:08.179 --> 00:09:10.081 position:7% line:89% align:start
She'll have to put up with you

00:09:10.114 --> 00:09:13.985 position:24% line:83% align:start
and your big stupid
mouth forever.

00:09:14.018 --> 00:09:17.722 position:16% line:89% align:start
(Borka and his men laugh)

00:09:22.294 --> 00:09:25.797 position:30% line:89% align:start
(scoffs softly)

00:09:25.831 --> 00:09:26.865 position:21% line:83% align:start
- We should probably
all just leave

00:09:26.899 --> 00:09:28.967 position:13% line:89% align:start
and let them two go at it.

00:09:36.875 --> 00:09:39.244 position:7% line:89% align:start
- Now you listen to me, Mattis.

00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:45.318 position:13% line:83% align:start
We couldn't stay in Borka's
Woods for any longer.

00:09:45.351 --> 00:09:47.086 position:30% line:83% align:start
The governor's
soldiers are there

00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:50.023 position:13% line:89% align:start
swarming around like flies.

00:09:50.056 --> 00:09:53.393 position:21% line:83% align:start
I had to take my wife
and my child and my men

00:09:53.426 --> 00:09:57.096 position:24% line:83% align:start
and find a new safe
home for them all.

00:09:57.130 --> 00:09:59.199 position:30% line:83% align:start
- You miserable
thief, how dare you

00:09:59.232 --> 00:10:01.234 position:24% line:83% align:start
come and live here
without asking me.

00:10:01.267 --> 00:10:03.970 position:7% line:89% align:start
You are utterly shameless, huh?

00:10:06.239 --> 00:10:08.942 position:21% line:83% align:start
- So you accuse me of
being a thief, then?

00:10:08.975 --> 00:10:10.877 position:19% line:89% align:start
Well, that's very rich.

00:10:10.910 --> 00:10:14.113 position:13% line:83% align:start
You, all your robber life,
you have taken everything

00:10:14.147 --> 00:10:16.450 position:24% line:83% align:start
you've ever wanted
without asking.

00:10:16.483 --> 00:10:17.251 position:41% line:89% align:start
- Huh?

00:10:19.119 --> 00:10:22.423 position:21% line:83% align:start
Have you taken things
without asking?

00:10:22.456 --> 00:10:25.292 position:24% line:89% align:start
(grunts nervously)

00:10:43.143 --> 00:10:46.914 position:16% line:83% align:start
- Well, it's complicated,
we'll talk later.

00:10:48.148 --> 00:10:51.519 position:21% line:83% align:start
Anyway, how on Earth
did you get in here?

00:10:51.553 --> 00:10:53.488 position:16% line:89% align:start
- Why, what's it to you?

00:10:54.955 --> 00:10:57.392 position:24% line:83% align:start
- I'd like to know
so I can throw

00:10:57.425 --> 00:11:01.529 position:16% line:83% align:start
you sneaky little thieves
out the way you came in.

00:11:09.371 --> 00:11:12.575 position:24% line:83% align:start
- You won't be able
to throw us out.

00:11:12.608 --> 00:11:16.044 position:7% line:89% align:start
You want to know how we got in?

00:11:16.077 --> 00:11:20.516 position:7% line:89% align:start
See my boy here, Birk Borkason?

00:11:24.119 --> 00:11:28.923 position:24% line:83% align:start
He will be a robber
chief, just like me.

00:11:28.957 --> 00:11:32.295 position:24% line:83% align:start
Oh yes, he's going
places in this world.

00:11:33.462 --> 00:11:35.998 position:35% line:89% align:start
Mostly, up.

00:11:38.367 --> 00:11:41.237 position:30% line:89% align:start
(uptempo music)

00:11:48.277 --> 00:11:50.279 position:41% line:89% align:start
(gasps)

00:12:16.006 --> 00:12:18.241 position:35% line:89% align:start
(whistles)

00:12:22.079 --> 00:12:24.014 position:13% line:89% align:start
Right, you bobs, let's go.

00:12:24.047 --> 00:12:27.485 position:21% line:89% align:start
(all shout in unison)

00:12:27.518 --> 00:12:30.321 position:30% line:89% align:start

00:12:37.595 --> 00:12:39.030 position:30% line:89% align:start
So now you see?

00:12:41.632 --> 00:12:43.935 position:38% line:89% align:start
(growls)

00:12:45.236 --> 00:12:46.971 position:35% line:89% align:start
(snickers)

00:12:47.004 --> 00:12:49.073 position:30% line:89% align:start
(growls softly)

00:12:49.107 --> 00:12:50.341 position:27% line:89% align:start
- You are lying,

00:12:50.375 --> 00:12:53.479 position:16% line:83% align:start
there is no such entrance
on the north side.

00:12:53.512 --> 00:12:55.279 position:24% line:83% align:start
- You've lived here
your whole life

00:12:55.313 --> 00:12:59.351 position:16% line:83% align:start
but you'd still get lost,
or you remember nothing.

00:12:59.385 --> 00:13:03.422 position:7% line:83% align:start
We were even close friends, or
did you forget that as well?

00:13:03.455 --> 00:13:04.223 position:41% line:89% align:start
- Huh?

00:13:05.591 --> 00:13:09.161 position:21% line:83% align:start
- When we were kids,
where was the pigsty, eh?

00:13:09.194 --> 00:13:10.562 position:33% line:89% align:start
- The pigsty?

00:13:10.596 --> 00:13:13.065 position:35% line:89% align:start
Uh (gasps).

00:13:17.569 --> 00:13:19.338 position:24% line:83% align:start
- [Borka] Way back
then, I hadn't realized

00:13:19.371 --> 00:13:21.440 position:24% line:83% align:start
that you and I were
in different clans.

00:13:21.473 --> 00:13:23.142 position:24% line:83% align:start
- [Mattis] I didn't
know, either.

00:13:23.175 --> 00:13:26.145 position:27% line:83% align:start
I used to invite
you to our castle.

00:13:26.178 --> 00:13:30.282 position:16% line:83% align:start
- [Borka] To think I was
actually friends with you.

00:13:35.255 --> 00:13:38.425 position:21% line:89% align:start
(door squeaks softly)

00:13:58.077 --> 00:14:00.313 position:13% line:89% align:start
- Hey, there's a small one.

00:14:05.386 --> 00:14:06.986 position:27% line:89% align:start
He went that way.

00:14:08.255 --> 00:14:10.391 position:21% line:89% align:start
- He's getting away!

00:14:10.424 --> 00:14:11.659 position:24% line:89% align:start
- Where did it go?

00:14:15.529 --> 00:14:17.398 position:41% line:89% align:start
(gasps)

00:14:17.431 --> 00:14:18.399 position:38% line:89% align:start
- Father?

00:14:39.788 --> 00:14:42.557 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Borka whimpers)

00:14:51.066 --> 00:14:51.700 position:44% line:89% align:start
- Ah.

00:14:53.468 --> 00:14:57.506 position:16% line:83% align:start
- So your father took me
outside and he beat me.

00:14:57.539 --> 00:15:01.576 position:19% line:83% align:start
He showed me absolutely
no mercy that day.

00:15:01.610 --> 00:15:03.411 position:24% line:83% align:start
- Of course, if he
stumbled across any of you

00:15:03.445 --> 00:15:08.350 position:24% line:83% align:start
sly Borka foxes he
showed you no mercy.

00:15:08.383 --> 00:15:11.687 position:10% line:83% align:start
My father was a great man who
taught me all I know today.

00:15:11.721 --> 00:15:14.423 position:24% line:83% align:start
- Now you listen to
me, my dear old friend.

00:15:14.457 --> 00:15:17.527 position:21% line:83% align:start
Your so-called great
man of a father

00:15:17.560 --> 00:15:21.197 position:27% line:83% align:start
taught me a very
valuable lesson.

00:15:21.230 --> 00:15:24.066 position:27% line:83% align:start
That you will be
my enemy always.

00:15:24.100 --> 00:15:27.103 position:24% line:83% align:start
- In that case, you
got two choices.

00:15:28.371 --> 00:15:32.275 position:19% line:83% align:start
Poor Undis can read my
poem of your sad demise,

00:15:33.543 --> 00:15:35.511 position:5% line:89% align:start
or, if you can't handle a fight,

00:15:35.545 --> 00:15:38.549 position:24% line:83% align:start
you can get out of
here straight away!

00:15:38.582 --> 00:15:39.716 position:27% line:89% align:start
One or the other!

00:15:41.350 --> 00:15:45.288 position:24% line:83% align:start
- (scoffs) Neither
is gonna happen.

00:15:45.322 --> 00:15:48.425 position:21% line:83% align:start
This is Borka's Keep,
we've made a home here,

00:15:48.458 --> 00:15:51.562 position:30% line:83% align:start
and we have no
intention of leaving,

00:15:51.595 --> 00:15:53.497 position:24% line:89% align:start
("leaving" echoes)

00:15:55.799 --> 00:16:00.170 position:16% line:89% align:start
- (growling) Ready, then?

00:16:00.203 --> 00:16:01.505 position:24% line:89% align:start
- [Together] Ready!

00:16:07.611 --> 00:16:10.615 position:24% line:89% align:start
(Mattis' men growl)

00:16:13.751 --> 00:16:17.589 position:24% line:89% align:start
(Borka's men growl)

00:16:17.622 --> 00:16:21.459 position:7% line:83% align:start
- Borka, you must see that you
can't fight them way up here.

00:16:21.492 --> 00:16:22.427 position:35% line:89% align:start
- Why not?

00:16:22.460 --> 00:16:25.363 position:21% line:83% align:start
- What do you really
think's gonna happen?

00:16:25.396 --> 00:16:28.366 position:30% line:83% align:start
You'll all fall
down into that pit.

00:16:28.399 --> 00:16:30.468 position:21% line:83% align:start
- You really want to
do this right now?

00:16:30.501 --> 00:16:33.338 position:7% line:89% align:start
- Lovis, what choice do I have?

00:16:33.371 --> 00:16:35.640 position:19% line:83% align:start
- Well, you could pick
a better place and time.

00:16:35.673 --> 00:16:37.609 position:21% line:83% align:start
- And I for one don't
want to have to clean up

00:16:37.642 --> 00:16:39.277 position:24% line:89% align:start
after all of this.

00:16:40.278 --> 00:16:42.815 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Borka grumbles)

00:16:44.282 --> 00:16:46.250 position:35% line:89% align:start
(grumbles)

00:16:46.284 --> 00:16:48.587 position:35% line:89% align:start
(grumbles)

00:16:48.621 --> 00:16:50.589 position:35% line:89% align:start
(grumbles)

00:16:58.864 --> 00:17:01.834 position:24% line:83% align:start
- Listen, I'm in no
mood for this today.

00:17:01.867 --> 00:17:02.735 position:35% line:89% align:start
You may go.

00:17:04.236 --> 00:17:06.672 position:10% line:89% align:start
You're a foolish, wild bull,

00:17:06.705 --> 00:17:10.409 position:27% line:83% align:start
but this fort is
mine, and one day,

00:17:10.442 --> 00:17:12.946 position:10% line:89% align:start
I'll throw you over the edge!

00:17:12.979 --> 00:17:16.248 position:24% line:83% align:start
- I look forward to
that, but if I am a bull,

00:17:16.281 --> 00:17:18.885 position:13% line:83% align:start
then you'd better watch out
for my sharp bull horns,

00:17:18.918 --> 00:17:23.423 position:13% line:83% align:start
as I will use them on you,
and drag you down there with me.

00:17:23.456 --> 00:17:25.525 position:35% line:89% align:start
(all laugh)

00:17:27.460 --> 00:17:30.463 position:24% line:89% align:start
(laughs maniacally)

00:17:45.713 --> 00:17:48.581 position:30% line:89% align:start
(rooster crows)

00:18:09.470 --> 00:18:10.638 position:30% line:89% align:start
- Hey, Father?

00:18:14.910 --> 00:18:19.313 position:13% line:83% align:start
Father, what did Borka mean
you take without asking?

00:18:21.750 --> 00:18:22.583 position:47% line:89% align:start
Hm?

00:18:26.955 --> 00:18:27.789 position:47% line:89% align:start
Hm.

00:18:46.341 --> 00:18:46.976 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmpf.

00:18:48.810 --> 00:18:50.780 position:7% line:89% align:start
- And I suppose that wild bull

00:18:50.813 --> 00:18:53.816 position:27% line:83% align:start
that you grabbed
by the horns today,

00:18:53.850 --> 00:18:57.720 position:21% line:83% align:start
made a crashing noise
(howls comically),

00:18:57.754 --> 00:18:59.622 position:21% line:89% align:start
something like that?

00:18:59.655 --> 00:19:01.958 position:30% line:89% align:start
Hey (laughing)?

00:19:03.659 --> 00:19:10.566 position:10% line:83% align:start
I imagine you could hear the
noise rumbling everywhere, huh?

00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:12.335 position:21% line:89% align:start
- Eat your porridge.

00:19:12.368 --> 00:19:15.772 position:30% line:83% align:start
That is, if you
can even chew it.

00:19:15.805 --> 00:19:18.808 position:13% line:89% align:start
You don't know, so please,

00:19:18.841 --> 00:19:22.946 position:19% line:83% align:start
don't say one more word
about it, all right, old man?

00:19:24.514 --> 00:19:27.416 position:24% line:89% align:start
(old man chortles)

00:19:28.652 --> 00:19:30.654 position:41% line:89% align:start

(laughs)

00:21:24.037 --> 00:21:26.740 position:27% line:83% align:start
- It's just like
swimming in ice.

00:21:49.163 --> 00:21:51.532 position:38% line:89% align:start
(shivers)

00:22:06.114 --> 00:22:07.215 position:7% line:89% align:start
Times like these, you've gotta

00:22:07.249 --> 00:22:09.784 position:7% line:89% align:start
move around a lot to keep warm.

00:22:26.969 --> 00:22:30.138 position:21% line:89% align:start

up at Birk and thought,

00:23:11.081 --> 00:23:14.550 position:19% line:83% align:start
I can no longer live in
peace, not in my own fort,

00:23:14.584 --> 00:23:18.022 position:24% line:83% align:start
and not even in my
own beautiful forest.

00:23:18.055 --> 00:23:20.057 position:13% line:89% align:start
Her anger welled up inside.

00:23:22.793 --> 00:23:26.096 position:21% line:83% align:start
