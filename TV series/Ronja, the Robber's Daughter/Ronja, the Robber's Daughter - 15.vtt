- [Narrator] Ronja and
Birk spent a perfect day

00:01:46.942 --> 00:01:49.645 position:24% line:83% align:start
enjoying the warmth
of springtime.

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:53.217 position:33% line:83% align:start
But when she
returned to the fort,

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.522 position:21% line:83% align:start
Ronja found Sturkas,
wounded by an arrow

00:01:56.555 --> 00:01:57.523 position:21% line:89% align:start
from a Borka Robber.

00:01:57.556 --> 00:01:58.525 position:41% line:89% align:start
- Argh!

00:02:01.194 --> 00:02:03.030 position:19% line:89% align:start
This is only the start.

00:02:03.064 --> 00:02:05.267 position:10% line:89% align:start
I'll crush each one of them!

00:02:09.573 --> 00:02:12.310 position:27% line:89% align:start
(peaceful music)

00:02:20.622 --> 00:02:23.259 position:19% line:89% align:start
- [Lovis] There we go.

00:02:23.292 --> 00:02:25.495 position:35% line:89% align:start
(groaning)

00:03:19.671 --> 00:03:21.773 position:19% line:89% align:start
- Will he be all right?

00:03:29.684 --> 00:03:31.019 position:27% line:89% align:start
- He'll be fine.

00:03:33.189 --> 00:03:34.023 position:44% line:89% align:start
Bed.

00:03:50.748 --> 00:03:52.716 position:24% line:89% align:start
Impressive Sturkas.

00:03:52.751 --> 00:03:54.819 position:10% line:89% align:start
That wound's already closed.

00:03:54.853 --> 00:03:55.688 position:41% line:89% align:start
- Well.

00:03:55.721 --> 00:03:56.489 position:38% line:89% align:start
Heh heh.

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:00.093 position:16% line:89% align:start
- Look he's embarrassed!

00:04:00.127 --> 00:04:02.297 position:35% line:89% align:start
(laughter)

00:04:05.601 --> 00:04:06.436 position:44% line:89% align:start
- Ow.

00:04:09.574 --> 00:04:11.810 position:35% line:89% align:start
(laughter)

00:04:33.908 --> 00:04:34.742 position:35% line:89% align:start
- Sturkas!

00:04:35.843 --> 00:04:38.547 position:16% line:89% align:start
- Sorry to worry you all.

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:40.182 position:21% line:89% align:start
I'm much better now.

00:04:41.819 --> 00:04:44.689 position:16% line:89% align:start
- You've healed already?

00:04:44.723 --> 00:04:48.661 position:19% line:83% align:start
- As you can see, I'm a
little weak in the legs,

00:04:48.694 --> 00:04:51.365 position:10% line:89% align:start
but otherwise I'm quite spry.

00:04:51.398 --> 00:04:52.165 position:41% line:89% align:start
Right?

00:05:00.276 --> 00:05:01.512 position:30% line:89% align:start
- [Robber] Ooh!

00:05:01.545 --> 00:05:02.848 position:24% line:83% align:start
- [Robber] Looking
good, Sturkas!

00:05:02.881 --> 00:05:04.917 position:13% line:89% align:start
- [Robber] Don't trip now!

00:05:06.954 --> 00:05:09.323 position:24% line:83% align:start
- [Narrator] By the
fourth day, Sturkas

00:05:09.356 --> 00:05:12.460 position:24% line:83% align:start
was finally able to
get up and walk around.

00:05:12.494 --> 00:05:14.597 position:19% line:83% align:start
Ronja had believed that
the feud between Mattis

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:17.300 position:13% line:89% align:start
and Borka would cool down,

00:05:17.334 --> 00:05:21.440 position:7% line:83% align:start
but instead it flared up again
and threatened to boil over.

00:05:38.898 --> 00:05:42.703 position:16% line:89% align:start
- One, two, three, four.

00:05:46.909 --> 00:05:47.844 position:30% line:89% align:start
Thank goodness.

00:05:47.877 --> 00:05:49.813 position:16% line:89% align:start
They're all safely home.

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:14.914 position:41% line:89% align:start
Mattis.

00:06:16.951 --> 00:06:17.785 position:44% line:89% align:start
- Hm?

00:06:19.955 --> 00:06:21.691 position:30% line:83% align:start
- What happened
between you and Borka?

00:06:21.724 --> 00:06:26.463 position:16% line:83% align:start
Tell me, why are you out
for each other's blood?

00:06:26.497 --> 00:06:27.966 position:19% line:89% align:start
- You should ask Borka.

00:06:27.999 --> 00:06:31.637 position:24% line:83% align:start
After all, he shot
the first arrow.

00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:33.774 position:13% line:89% align:start
Sturkas can tell you that.

00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:39.615 position:21% line:83% align:start
- That child has more
sense than you have.

00:06:41.451 --> 00:06:45.090 position:16% line:83% align:start
This can only end badly,
in bloodshed and misery.

00:06:45.123 --> 00:06:46.859 position:7% line:89% align:start
Is that what you want, Mattis?

00:06:46.893 --> 00:06:49.897 position:21% line:83% align:start
And what good exactly
would that do us?

00:06:52.667 --> 00:06:56.338 position:30% line:83% align:start
- And what good
would that do us?

00:06:56.372 --> 00:07:00.812 position:7% line:89% align:start
Oh I'll tell you exactly what!

00:07:00.845 --> 00:07:04.884 position:10% line:83% align:start
We'd finally be rid of Borka
and his vermin forever!

00:07:04.918 --> 00:07:06.753 position:19% line:89% align:start
And that would be good.

00:07:10.859 --> 00:07:13.029 position:19% line:89% align:start
- Good for who, Mattis?

00:07:13.062 --> 00:07:15.132 position:27% line:83% align:start
Why must there be
all this bloodshed?

00:07:15.165 --> 00:07:17.634 position:24% line:83% align:start
Is that really what
you want to do?

00:07:17.668 --> 00:07:19.771 position:13% line:89% align:start
There must be another way.

00:07:21.674 --> 00:07:24.945 position:21% line:83% align:start
- Why don't you find
another way, then?

00:07:24.979 --> 00:07:26.848 position:19% line:89% align:start
Since you're so clever.

00:07:28.183 --> 00:07:30.887 position:27% line:83% align:start
You can get Borka
out of the fort,

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:35.160 position:13% line:83% align:start
then he can settle down as
peaceful as a fox in its den,

00:07:35.193 --> 00:07:39.031 position:21% line:83% align:start
and all his thieving
pups around him!

00:07:39.065 --> 00:07:42.937 position:19% line:83% align:start
Oh, I promise, I won't
even lay a hand on them!

00:07:45.908 --> 00:07:50.814 position:19% line:83% align:start
Although, I must be at
least allowed to kill Borka.

00:07:50.847 --> 00:07:54.686 position:24% line:83% align:start
I can't have my men
thinking of me as a coward!

00:08:16.083 --> 00:08:18.119 position:24% line:89% align:start
Listen, all of you.

00:08:18.152 --> 00:08:20.155 position:13% line:89% align:start
If we see Borka, we attack!

00:08:21.056 --> 00:08:22.659 position:41% line:89% align:start
- Yeah!

00:08:22.692 --> 00:08:23.927 position:35% line:89% align:start
- Let's go!

00:08:23.961 --> 00:08:24.728 position:41% line:89% align:start
Hiyah!

00:08:47.559 --> 00:08:49.997 position:33% line:89% align:start
(slow music)

00:09:17.001 --> 00:09:17.835 position:41% line:89% align:start
- Birk.

00:09:19.204 --> 00:09:20.239 position:41% line:89% align:start
- Yes?

00:09:58.259 --> 00:10:02.230 position:19% line:83% align:start
And now, even spring's
been ruined for both of us.

00:10:04.767 --> 00:10:06.669 position:19% line:89% align:start
Thanks to our fathers.

00:10:06.702 --> 00:10:08.306 position:30% line:89% align:start
Stubborn mules.

00:10:08.339 --> 00:10:11.009 position:33% line:83% align:start
Those old men
deserve each other.

00:10:20.889 --> 00:10:24.328 position:24% line:83% align:start
- Birk, if I didn't
have you as a brother

00:10:27.766 --> 00:10:31.170 position:19% line:83% align:start
I'd have known nothing
about any of this.

00:10:38.114 --> 00:10:40.784 position:5% line:89% align:start
And maybe I wouldn't have minded

00:10:40.817 --> 00:10:43.387 position:30% line:83% align:start
that Mattis and
Borka are enemies.

00:10:48.361 --> 00:10:49.929 position:24% line:89% align:start
So it's your fault.

00:10:49.963 --> 00:10:51.966 position:7% line:89% align:start
Your fault that I'm so unhappy.

00:10:51.999 --> 00:10:54.202 position:13% line:89% align:start
I blame you, Birk Borkason!

00:10:56.105 --> 00:11:00.245 position:19% line:83% align:start
- Blame me, sure, if it
makes you feel better.

00:11:00.278 --> 00:11:02.680 position:16% line:89% align:start
But I'm worried as well.

00:11:05.385 --> 00:11:08.055 position:16% line:89% align:start
- I know, it's terrible,

00:11:08.089 --> 00:11:09.957 position:10% line:89% align:start
not knowing who will be alive

00:11:09.991 --> 00:11:14.697 position:21% line:83% align:start
and who will be dead
when the day is done.

00:11:14.731 --> 00:11:18.837 position:27% line:83% align:start
- Well, at least
nobody's died yet, Ronja.

00:11:18.870 --> 00:11:21.207 position:21% line:83% align:start
Although that's only
because the sheriff's men

00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:23.410 position:24% line:83% align:start
have returned, and
now they're swarming

00:11:23.443 --> 00:11:26.080 position:7% line:89% align:start
through the forest once again.

00:11:33.491 --> 00:11:35.427 position:7% line:89% align:start
Mattis and Borka simply haven't

00:11:35.460 --> 00:11:38.231 position:27% line:83% align:start
had the chance to
kill each other.

00:11:46.242 --> 00:11:50.415 position:13% line:83% align:start
They have their hands full,
keeping away from the soldiers.

00:11:55.788 --> 00:11:59.961 position:16% line:83% align:start
- Suppose that will keep
them busy for a little while.

00:12:01.496 --> 00:12:05.868 position:10% line:83% align:start
- Just imagine the sheriff's
men actually being useful?

00:12:05.902 --> 00:12:07.471 position:19% line:89% align:start
Who'd have thought it?

00:12:15.215 --> 00:12:17.452 position:35% line:89% align:start
(laughing)

00:12:24.428 --> 00:12:28.400 position:21% line:83% align:start
- All the same, it's
something else to worry about.

00:12:54.269 --> 00:12:56.539 position:35% line:89% align:start
(whistles)

00:13:04.016 --> 00:13:06.520 position:7% line:89% align:start
- They're both such nightmares.

00:13:06.553 --> 00:13:10.459 position:24% line:83% align:start
And yet, they spend
their days so peacefully.

00:13:26.548 --> 00:13:28.950 position:10% line:89% align:start
- Bye Birk, see you tomorrow?

00:13:30.152 --> 00:13:31.521 position:24% line:89% align:start
- See you tomorrow.

00:13:53.619 --> 00:13:57.424 position:21% line:83% align:start
Maybe there won't be
joy as there once was.

00:14:30.437 --> 00:14:31.271 position:38% line:89% align:start
- Ronja.

00:14:35.377 --> 00:14:36.679 position:38% line:89% align:start
- Ronja!

00:14:36.712 --> 00:14:37.613 position:30% line:89% align:start
Hurry on home!

00:14:40.584 --> 00:14:43.721 position:27% line:83% align:start
- Something good
must have happened!

00:14:43.755 --> 00:14:45.089 position:27% line:89% align:start
It's so obvious.

00:14:45.123 --> 00:14:47.259 position:7% line:89% align:start
Your faces give you both away!

00:14:47.293 --> 00:14:50.163 position:27% line:83% align:start
- Oh, yes indeed,
you're right there!

00:14:50.197 --> 00:14:52.133 position:16% line:89% align:start
Go and see for yourself!

00:14:53.368 --> 00:14:54.571 position:38% line:89% align:start
- I will!

00:14:59.711 --> 00:15:00.745 position:38% line:89% align:start
- Hurry!

00:15:10.593 --> 00:15:11.427 position:38% line:89% align:start
- Ronja!

00:15:13.730 --> 00:15:15.398 position:33% line:89% align:start
- I'm coming!

00:15:36.795 --> 00:15:39.266 position:35% line:89% align:start
(laughter)

00:15:46.308 --> 00:15:48.378 position:16% line:89% align:start
- Oh, Ronja, you're back!

00:15:56.155 --> 00:15:58.392 position:35% line:89% align:start
(laughter)

00:15:59.794 --> 00:16:02.231 position:16% line:89% align:start
You were right all along!

00:16:02.264 --> 00:16:03.833 position:19% line:89% align:start
There was another way.

00:16:03.867 --> 00:16:06.637 position:21% line:83% align:start
Now there will be no
need for bloodshed.

00:16:06.671 --> 00:16:08.639 position:27% line:83% align:start
And Borka can go
to blazes faster

00:16:08.674 --> 00:16:11.711 position:21% line:83% align:start
than his first belch
after breakfast!

00:16:15.482 --> 00:16:16.183 position:35% line:89% align:start
Believe me!

00:16:17.552 --> 00:16:20.389 position:27% line:83% align:start
- Great, and how
will you do that?

00:16:21.792 --> 00:16:23.861 position:30% line:89% align:start
- Take a look.

00:16:23.895 --> 00:16:26.765 position:27% line:83% align:start
See who I caught
with my own hands.

00:16:29.836 --> 00:16:30.670 position:30% line:89% align:start
You see, Ronja,

00:16:32.238 --> 00:16:35.410 position:24% line:83% align:start
I only have to say
to that Borka devil,

00:16:37.245 --> 00:16:40.417 position:10% line:89% align:start
"Are you staying in the fort?

00:16:40.451 --> 00:16:42.386 position:16% line:89% align:start
"Or might you be going?"

00:16:44.289 --> 00:16:48.462 position:7% line:83% align:start
Borka, do you want that little
snake of yours back, or not?

00:16:54.503 --> 00:16:56.439 position:41% line:89% align:start
(gasp)

00:17:05.753 --> 00:17:08.723 position:19% line:89% align:start
Well, little Borkason,

00:17:08.757 --> 00:17:10.458 position:24% line:83% align:start
are you going home
to your father?

00:17:10.492 --> 00:17:11.527 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmm?

00:17:11.560 --> 00:17:13.730 position:35% line:89% align:start
(laughter)

00:17:21.775 --> 00:17:23.878 position:38% line:89% align:start
(shriek)

00:17:39.766 --> 00:17:43.872 position:24% line:89% align:start
You can't do that!

00:17:52.484 --> 00:17:54.921 position:24% line:89% align:start
You can't do that!

00:17:56.824 --> 00:17:59.259 position:10% line:89% align:start
You beast, you can't do that!

00:18:04.634 --> 00:18:05.902 position:35% line:89% align:start
You can't!

00:18:08.406 --> 00:18:09.908 position:24% line:89% align:start
- I can't do that?

00:18:11.711 --> 00:18:15.716 position:19% line:83% align:start
And what is it that my
daughter says I can't do?

00:18:17.953 --> 00:18:19.822 position:27% line:89% align:start
- I'll tell you!

00:18:19.856 --> 00:18:21.290 position:47% line:89% align:start
Ah!

00:18:21.324 --> 00:18:24.996 position:19% line:83% align:start
You can go robbing all
the gold and silver

00:18:25.029 --> 00:18:27.566 position:13% line:89% align:start
and rubbish that you want!

00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:32.940 position:7% line:89% align:start
But no, you can't hurt people!

00:18:34.509 --> 00:18:36.845 position:16% line:89% align:start
Because if you do Mattis,

00:18:37.847 --> 00:18:41.685 position:27% line:83% align:start
I no longer want
to be your child!

00:18:44.556 --> 00:18:46.960 position:10% line:89% align:start
- Who's talking about people?

00:18:48.695 --> 00:18:53.002 position:21% line:83% align:start
What I've caught here
is a little snake.

00:18:53.035 --> 00:18:56.473 position:21% line:83% align:start
At best he's a louse
or a thieving hound.

00:18:57.942 --> 00:19:01.914 position:16% line:83% align:start
This fortress has been in
our clan for generations,

00:19:01.947 --> 00:19:05.920 position:21% line:83% align:start
and now I'm going to
get it cleaned out.

00:19:05.953 --> 00:19:10.860 position:16% line:83% align:start
And once that's done, you
can be my daughter or not

00:19:10.893 --> 00:19:12.395 position:24% line:89% align:start
just as you choose.

00:19:13.931 --> 00:19:15.767 position:27% line:89% align:start
- I despise you!

00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:16.634 position:35% line:89% align:start
I hate you!

00:19:17.970 --> 00:19:22.042 position:16% line:83% align:start
- Oh Ronja, that's no way
to talk to your father.

00:19:22.075 --> 00:19:23.077 position:35% line:89% align:start
Come away.

00:19:23.110 --> 00:19:24.011 position:35% line:89% align:start
Come away.

00:19:24.045 --> 00:19:26.380 position:10% line:89% align:start
- Do you hear me, I hate you!

00:19:31.689 --> 00:19:32.523 position:38% line:89% align:start
- Fjosok.

00:19:33.825 --> 00:19:34.659 position:41% line:89% align:start
- Yes?

00:19:35.660 --> 00:19:37.597 position:27% line:89% align:start
- Send a message.

00:19:37.630 --> 00:19:39.833 position:13% line:89% align:start
Tell Borka I'll be waiting.

00:19:39.867 --> 00:19:42.470 position:5% line:89% align:start
Tomorrow morning, at Hell's Gap.

00:19:43.973 --> 00:19:47.444 position:21% line:83% align:start
He'd better be there,
for the boy's sake.

00:19:47.477 --> 00:19:49.046 position:19% line:89% align:start
- [Fjosok] Yes, Chief!

00:19:57.992 --> 00:20:00.996 position:13% line:83% align:start
- [Mattis] Don't you lay a
hand on that little snake!

00:20:01.029 --> 00:20:03.399 position:10% line:89% align:start
- Whether he's a snake or not

00:20:05.702 --> 00:20:08.139 position:10% line:89% align:start
this wound has to be cleaned.

00:20:23.060 --> 00:20:23.894 position:38% line:89% align:start
- Lovis!

00:20:31.973 --> 00:20:34.742 position:24% line:89% align:start
- Why'd you hit me?

00:20:36.145 --> 00:20:38.214 position:19% line:89% align:start
- Listen, all you men!

00:20:38.248 --> 00:20:42.720 position:19% line:83% align:start
You can all just go and
fall into Hell's Gap!

00:20:42.753 --> 00:20:45.524 position:21% line:83% align:start
You never do anything
but cause trouble!

00:20:45.557 --> 00:20:47.527 position:19% line:89% align:start
Do you hear me, Mattis?

00:20:47.560 --> 00:20:50.098 position:7% line:89% align:start
Throw yourself into Hell's Gap!

00:21:01.747 --> 00:21:02.581 position:41% line:89% align:start
- Birk!

00:21:12.628 --> 00:21:13.831 position:35% line:89% align:start
I hate you!

00:21:13.864 --> 00:21:14.631 position:41% line:89% align:start
Mattis!

00:21:15.900 --> 00:21:17.736 position:41% line:89% align:start
Mattis!

00:21:42.170 --> 00:21:44.640 position:27% line:83% align:start
- [Narrator] That
night, Mattis did not go

00:21:44.673 --> 00:21:46.276 position:21% line:89% align:start
to bed beside Lovis.

00:21:50.114 --> 00:21:53.552 position:21% line:83% align:start
Nobody knew where he
slept, not even her.

00:22:00.228 --> 00:22:02.365 position:10% line:89% align:start
- Now I can sleep how I like.

00:22:02.398 --> 00:22:05.602 position:27% line:83% align:start
Lie lengthwise or
crosswise in this bed.

00:22:10.009 --> 00:22:11.944 position:41% line:89% align:start
(sobs)

00:22:21.891 --> 00:22:23.227 position:27% line:89% align:start
- [Ronja] Don't.

00:22:34.109 --> 00:22:37.347 position:19% line:83% align:start
- [Narrator] Ronja lay
awake hating her father

00:22:37.380 --> 00:22:40.818 position:24% line:83% align:start
until she felt her
heart contract in pain.

00:23:02.915 --> 00:23:05.152 position:24% line:83% align:start
But it's difficult
to hate someone

00:23:05.185 --> 00:23:07.688 position:7% line:89% align:start
you have loved your whole life.

00:23:11.261 --> 00:23:15.433 position:10% line:83% align:start
That was why for Ronja, this
was the darkest of nights.

00:23:22.843 --> 00:23:26.348 position:24% line:83% align:start
Next time on Ronja,
the Robber's Daughter.

00:23:30.421 --> 00:23:33.358 position:10% line:89% align:start
"Endless Fighting, Part Two".

00:23:33.392 --> 00:23:34.293 position:30% line:89% align:start
Don't miss it!

00:23:36.762 --> 00:23:39.333 position:30% line:89% align:start
(upbeat music)
