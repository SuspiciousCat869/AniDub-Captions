(grunting)

00:01:41.751 --> 00:01:42.783 position:35% line:89% align:start
- Why, you!

00:01:42.816 --> 00:01:45.210 position:30% line:89% align:start
(arrow thwacks)

00:01:45.243 --> 00:01:46.774 position:27% line:83% align:start
- [Narrator] Days
turned into weeks

00:01:46.807 --> 00:01:48.670 position:27% line:83% align:start
as Mattis and his
men tried to chase

00:01:48.703 --> 00:01:52.461 position:13% line:83% align:start
Borka and his robbers from
the north side of the fort.

00:01:52.495 --> 00:01:54.723 position:10% line:89% align:start
The autumn woods fell silent

00:01:54.757 --> 00:01:58.749 position:19% line:83% align:start
as the weather changed
and winter arrived.

00:01:58.782 --> 00:02:02.541 position:30% line:83% align:start
No robbers, and
not a sign of Birk,

00:02:02.574 --> 00:02:05.167 position:5% line:89% align:start
no matter how hard Ronja looked.

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:14.581 position:24% line:89% align:start
(breathing heavily)

00:02:14.615 --> 00:02:17.609 position:21% line:89% align:start
(footsteps thudding)

00:02:29.616 --> 00:02:31.445 position:19% line:89% align:start
- Good morning, Turre.

00:02:34.339 --> 00:02:35.171 position:44% line:89% align:start
Wow!

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.660 position:21% line:83% align:start
More beautiful than I
could have imagined.

00:02:40.693 --> 00:02:44.085 position:19% line:89% align:start
An ice forest. (gasps)

00:02:46.613 --> 00:02:49.275 position:30% line:89% align:start
(Turre sneezes)

(robbers grunting)

00:03:22.071 --> 00:03:23.569 position:21% line:89% align:start
- Look at your face.

00:03:23.602 --> 00:03:26.595 position:21% line:83% align:start
You'd think you were
digging a grave.

00:03:28.325 --> 00:03:31.618 position:27% line:83% align:start
- That's right, a
grave for you, old man.

00:03:31.652 --> 00:03:32.881 position:33% line:89% align:start
Ready for it?

00:03:34.046 --> 00:03:36.275 position:35% line:89% align:start
(laughing)

00:03:38.171 --> 00:03:40.931 position:27% line:89% align:start

(Noddle-Pete cackles)

00:03:47.318 --> 00:03:48.382 position:24% line:89% align:start
- Stop lying about.

00:03:48.416 --> 00:03:51.343 position:10% line:89% align:start
There's too much work to do.

00:03:51.376 --> 00:03:52.906 position:38% line:89% align:start
- I know.

00:03:52.939 --> 00:03:55.334 position:7% line:89% align:start
But thank you for the reminder.

00:03:55.367 --> 00:03:58.295 position:27% line:83% align:start
And remind me to
get you back later.

00:03:58.328 --> 00:04:03.218 position:5% line:83% align:start
- All we have to eat are pickled
vegetables and salted meat.

00:04:03.251 --> 00:04:06.578 position:13% line:83% align:start
It's so cold, we can barely
even do our robbing jobs.

00:04:06.611 --> 00:04:11.433 position:13% line:83% align:start
Day after day, all there is
to do is (grunts) shovel snow.

00:04:11.467 --> 00:04:14.128 position:30% line:89% align:start
(sighs heavily)

00:04:14.161 --> 00:04:16.390 position:30% line:89% align:start

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:22.377 position:16% line:89% align:start
(energetic, upbeat music)

00:04:32.289 --> 00:04:33.886 position:27% line:89% align:start
- It looks good.

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:37.213 position:21% line:83% align:start
You should be able to
wear this for a while.

00:04:37.246 --> 00:04:39.739 position:30% line:89% align:start
(Ronja laughs)

00:04:57.835 --> 00:04:58.733 position:33% line:89% align:start
- Wonderful!

00:04:58.766 --> 00:05:00.330 position:33% line:89% align:start
I love them!

00:05:00.364 --> 00:05:03.091 position:16% line:89% align:start
- Take good care of them.

00:05:03.124 --> 00:05:04.653 position:21% line:89% align:start
- I will, I promise.

00:05:09.377 --> 00:05:12.903 position:19% line:89% align:start
(door creaks and slams)

00:05:13.834 --> 00:05:16.363 position:27% line:89% align:start

00:05:17.925 --> 00:05:19.323 position:24% line:89% align:start
- [Ronja] Everyone!

00:05:20.354 --> 00:05:24.711 position:16% line:89% align:start
Isn't the snow wonderful?

00:05:26.008 --> 00:05:27.140 position:27% line:89% align:start
- [Pelje] Ronja!

00:05:31.231 --> 00:05:33.094 position:30% line:89% align:start
(Pelje grunts)

00:05:33.127 --> 00:05:37.251 position:33% line:83% align:start
(snow thuds)
(Ronja exclaims)

00:05:37.285 --> 00:05:40.212 position:30% line:89% align:start
(Pelje laughs)

00:05:40.245 --> 00:05:42.906 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Pelje whistles)

00:05:44.802 --> 00:05:48.660 position:10% line:89% align:start
- Hey, Pelje, come down here.

00:05:48.693 --> 00:05:51.056 position:30% line:89% align:start
(Pelje laughs)

00:05:54.149 --> 00:05:56.843 position:19% line:83% align:start
- It'll take more than
that to knock me down.

00:05:56.877 --> 00:05:59.970 position:21% line:89% align:start
- All right. (grunts)

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:04.061 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Pelje exclaims)

00:06:07.255 --> 00:06:10.248 position:30% line:89% align:start
(Pelje screams)

00:06:10.281 --> 00:06:11.047 position:38% line:89% align:start

00:06:37.124 --> 00:06:41.116 position:7% line:89% align:start
(robbers laughing and grunting)

00:06:58.214 --> 00:07:00.641 position:35% line:89% align:start
(laughing)

00:07:08.724 --> 00:07:10.420 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Tjorm exclaims)

00:07:10.454 --> 00:07:12.184 position:41% line:83% align:start
- Yes!
- You can't get me.

00:07:12.217 --> 00:07:14.978 position:35% line:89% align:start
(laughing)

00:07:15.011 --> 00:07:19.868 position:5% line:89% align:start
- Oh, leave me alone. (exclaims)

00:07:19.901 --> 00:07:22.361 position:35% line:89% align:start
(laughing)

00:07:24.756 --> 00:07:27.118 position:30% line:89% align:start
(Tjorm growls)

00:07:29.646 --> 00:07:32.407 position:27% line:89% align:start
(Tjorm grunting)

00:07:51.766 --> 00:07:52.597 position:44% line:89% align:start
- Ha.

00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:57.953 position:16% line:89% align:start
(Tjorm exclaims in fear)

00:07:59.749 --> 00:08:02.044 position:27% line:83% align:start
- I asked you to
clear away the snow,

00:08:02.078 --> 00:08:04.472 position:5% line:89% align:start
not throw it all over the place.

00:08:04.506 --> 00:08:07.699 position:19% line:89% align:start
(Noddle-Pete snickers)

00:08:09.461 --> 00:08:11.823 position:30% line:89% align:start
(Lovis grunts)

00:08:12.788 --> 00:08:15.749 position:27% line:89% align:start
(snow crunching)

00:08:21.303 --> 00:08:23.998 position:24% line:89% align:start
(Sturkas grunting)

00:08:31.315 --> 00:08:34.675 position:5% line:89% align:start
- I always draw the short straw.

00:08:34.709 --> 00:08:35.806 position:35% line:89% align:start
- Oh yeah?

00:08:35.839 --> 00:08:38.800 position:5% line:83% align:start
And who do you think's shoveling
snow to make you a path?

00:08:38.833 --> 00:08:41.827 position:27% line:83% align:start
Ugh, there is no
job worse than this.

00:08:41.860 --> 00:08:44.621 position:19% line:89% align:start
And how hard can it be

00:08:44.654 --> 00:08:47.781 position:19% line:83% align:start
for you, with your nice
warm coat of pudgy fat,

00:08:47.814 --> 00:08:49.510 position:21% line:89% align:start
to fetch some water?

00:08:49.543 --> 00:08:50.841 position:33% line:89% align:start
- Pudgy fat?

00:08:50.875 --> 00:08:54.266 position:16% line:83% align:start
Should I ever die like a
dog buried in the snow,

00:08:54.299 --> 00:08:57.793 position:10% line:83% align:start
then I'll appear by your bed
as a ghost and haunt you.

00:08:57.826 --> 00:08:59.722 position:19% line:89% align:start
- Tjorm as a ghost, eh?

00:08:59.756 --> 00:09:03.581 position:13% line:89% align:start
(laughs) You wouldn't dare.

00:09:03.613 --> 00:09:05.210 position:5% line:89% align:start
You'd be too afraid of yourself.

00:09:05.243 --> 00:09:06.741 position:27% line:89% align:start
Boo! Ah! (laughs)

00:09:06.774 --> 00:09:07.538 position:35% line:89% align:start
- Oh yeah?

00:09:08.770 --> 00:09:10.732 position:27% line:83% align:start
Just you see, I'm
going to haunt you!

00:09:10.765 --> 00:09:12.228 position:41% line:89% align:start
I will!

00:09:12.261 --> 00:09:13.792 position:7% line:89% align:start
- [Sturkas] Ah, do as you wish.

00:09:13.826 --> 00:09:15.822 position:30% line:83% align:start
- [Tjorm] I'll
haunt you tonight.

00:09:15.855 --> 00:09:17.651 position:21% line:83% align:start
- [Sturkas] Shut up,
you're not even dead.

00:09:17.684 --> 00:09:18.449 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yet.

00:09:24.337 --> 00:09:25.567 position:27% line:89% align:start
- [Mattis] Ronja!

00:09:27.862 --> 00:09:28.860 position:38% line:89% align:start
Up here!

00:09:30.723 --> 00:09:34.182 position:24% line:83% align:start
- [Ronja] What are
you doing there?

00:09:34.215 --> 00:09:35.379 position:30% line:89% align:start
- Come up here.

00:09:36.643 --> 00:09:39.571 position:19% line:89% align:start
- Okay, be right there.

00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:44.193 position:30% line:89% align:start
(Ronja laughs)

00:09:49.416 --> 00:09:52.077 position:30% line:89% align:start
(wood clunking)

00:09:59.096 --> 00:10:00.792 position:19% line:89% align:start
- Where did I put them?

00:10:04.085 --> 00:10:06.347 position:13% line:89% align:start
- What are you looking for?

00:10:07.545 --> 00:10:11.036 position:21% line:83% align:start
- You'll be cleaning
up that mess, not me.

00:10:12.567 --> 00:10:16.526 position:16% line:83% align:start
Mattis, you better listen
to what I'm telling you.

00:10:21.182 --> 00:10:23.644 position:30% line:89% align:start
(Mattis groans)

00:10:26.771 --> 00:10:28.633 position:21% line:89% align:start
- Ah, here they are!

00:10:33.490 --> 00:10:36.417 position:16% line:83% align:start
I used to ski with these
when I was your age.

00:13:05.268 --> 00:13:06.233 position:38% line:89% align:start
- Great.

00:13:06.266 --> 00:13:07.197 position:33% line:89% align:start
Really well.

(snow crunching)

00:13:18.141 --> 00:13:20.303 position:13% line:89% align:start

(Joen grunts)

00:14:40.831 --> 00:14:44.757 position:13% line:83% align:start

given Ronja those skis.

00:14:44.790 --> 00:14:47.617 position:24% line:83% align:start
I really hope that
she's all right.

00:14:48.981 --> 00:14:53.139 position:13% line:83% align:start
If something's happened to
her, I couldn't stand it.

00:14:54.835 --> 00:14:58.062 position:24% line:83% align:start
- (Grunts) Will you
please stop moaning?

00:14:58.095 --> 00:14:59.892 position:27% line:83% align:start
That child knows
what she's doing

00:14:59.925 --> 00:15:04.481 position:16% line:83% align:start
and can take better care
of herself than any robber.

(Mattis sighs)

00:15:08.207 --> 00:15:10.834 position:24% line:83% align:start

do I have to tell you

00:15:10.868 --> 00:15:12.464 position:21% line:89% align:start
she'll be just fine?

00:15:23.874 --> 00:15:25.670 position:27% line:89% align:start
- You be careful.

00:15:28.165 --> 00:15:30.859 position:19% line:83% align:start
- [Narrator] It didn't
sound like a warning,

00:15:30.892 --> 00:15:32.987 position:19% line:89% align:start
just something you say.

00:15:33.021 --> 00:15:37.977 position:19% line:83% align:start
She could take care of
herself, or so she thought,

00:15:38.011 --> 00:15:40.704 position:7% line:89% align:start
but later, something happened,

00:15:40.738 --> 00:15:44.896 position:19% line:83% align:start
and it was just as well
that Mattis didn't know.

00:17:16.501 --> 00:17:20.393 position:16% line:83% align:start

more time in the day.

00:17:25.882 --> 00:17:29.540 position:30% line:83% align:start
The last one is

00:18:38.261 --> 00:18:39.924 position:13% line:89% align:start
- Hey, Rumphobs aren't you?

00:18:41.388 --> 00:18:44.448 position:13% line:83% align:start
I am so relieved you're not
a pack of those Gray Dwarves.

00:18:44.481 --> 00:18:45.679 position:30% line:89% align:start
They are nasty.

00:18:45.713 --> 00:18:48.074 position:10% line:89% align:start
And maybe you could help me.

00:18:48.106 --> 00:18:52.498 position:19% line:83% align:start
After all, Rumphobs are
friendly and peaceful, right?

00:18:52.531 --> 00:18:56.090 position:24% line:83% align:start
Silly, really, but
I've got my leg caught.

00:19:40.263 --> 00:19:42.558 position:19% line:89% align:start
My leg, it won't move.

00:19:42.592 --> 00:19:47.181 position:19% line:83% align:start
Please, help me get my

(Father Rumphob sighs)

00:19:49.244 --> 00:19:52.437 position:21% line:83% align:start

the most important thing

00:22:37.122 --> 00:22:41.645 position:16% line:83% align:start
in Mattis' Forest: never
let yourself be frightened.

00:22:41.678 --> 00:22:44.938 position:21% line:83% align:start
But right then, that
seemed impossible.

00:22:44.971 --> 00:22:45.936 position:30% line:89% align:start
She was afraid.

Afraid that she
couldn't free herself.

Afraid that she would freeze
