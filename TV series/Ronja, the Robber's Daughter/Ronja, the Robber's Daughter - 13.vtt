- Why don't you have
some, go on, take it all.

00:01:43.945 --> 00:01:46.147 position:24% line:83% align:start
- [Narrator] Ronja
and Birk were reunited

00:01:46.181 --> 00:01:49.550 position:21% line:83% align:start
in the vault beneath
the divided fort.

00:01:49.583 --> 00:01:53.053 position:19% line:83% align:start
But Birk was different,
he had grown very thin

00:01:53.087 --> 00:01:55.889 position:10% line:83% align:start
because the Borka robbers had
left all their supplies behind

00:01:55.922 --> 00:01:58.524 position:10% line:89% align:start
when fleeing their old home.

00:01:58.558 --> 00:02:00.792 position:27% line:83% align:start
So every morning,
Ronja smuggled food

00:02:00.826 --> 00:02:03.562 position:16% line:83% align:start
from her mother's pantry
for Birk's family.

00:02:03.595 --> 00:02:06.697 position:13% line:83% align:start
Throughout the long winter,
this was what kept Birk

00:02:06.731 --> 00:02:09.800 position:10% line:89% align:start
and the Borka robbers alive.

00:02:09.834 --> 00:02:12.435 position:30% line:89% align:start
(lively music)

00:03:06.648 --> 00:03:09.217 position:7% line:83% align:start
- It's really funny, just when
Undis thinks she's run out,

00:03:09.251 --> 00:03:11.552 position:13% line:89% align:start
she finds more food there.

00:03:13.254 --> 00:03:16.023 position:21% line:83% align:start
"The harpies must be
bringing us extra supplies."

00:03:16.057 --> 00:03:18.525 position:13% line:89% align:start
That's what she said to me.

00:03:18.558 --> 00:03:20.994 position:33% line:89% align:start
(both giggle)

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:26.098 position:13% line:89% align:start
But I suppose she's right,

00:03:26.131 --> 00:03:28.599 position:27% line:83% align:start
perhaps it really
is sorcery at work.

00:03:28.633 --> 00:03:29.201 position:41% line:89% align:start
- Huh?

00:03:32.971 --> 00:03:37.674 position:13% line:83% align:start
- It's just, you do look a
bit like a harpy, admit it.

00:03:37.708 --> 00:03:40.110 position:19% line:89% align:start
- Hey, don't say that.

00:03:40.143 --> 00:03:42.011 position:7% line:89% align:start
I'm far too nice to be a harpy.

00:03:42.044 --> 00:03:45.147 position:7% line:89% align:start
Plus, I don't even have claws.

00:03:47.216 --> 00:03:49.651 position:35% line:89% align:start
(chuckles)

00:03:53.955 --> 00:03:56.190 position:21% line:83% align:start
- Well, if you were a
harpy, you'd be a nice one.

00:03:56.223 --> 00:03:57.124 position:13% line:89% align:start
I mean, how many more times

00:03:57.157 --> 00:04:00.260 position:19% line:83% align:start
do you plan to save my
life, sister mine?

00:04:00.294 --> 00:04:05.231 position:10% line:83% align:start
About as many times as you've
saved my life, at least.

00:04:05.264 --> 00:04:07.266 position:24% line:83% align:start
But listen, I don't
know if you and I

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:10.202 position:7% line:89% align:start
can manage without one another.

00:04:10.235 --> 00:04:12.304 position:16% line:89% align:start
We're stronger together.

00:04:12.337 --> 00:04:13.671 position:30% line:89% align:start
- Hm, I agree,

00:04:15.072 --> 00:04:19.210 position:13% line:83% align:start
but I can't see Mattis and
Borka kissin' and makin' up.

00:04:19.243 --> 00:04:21.811 position:33% line:89% align:start
(both laugh)

00:04:26.648 --> 00:04:30.818 position:13% line:83% align:start
- Hey, Birk, still hungry,
or have you eaten enough?

00:04:32.787 --> 00:04:35.256 position:30% line:89% align:start
(comical music)

00:04:38.159 --> 00:04:42.695 position:7% line:89% align:start
Now then, it's time, for this.

00:04:42.728 --> 00:04:43.562 position:44% line:89% align:start
- Uh.

00:04:47.333 --> 00:04:50.202 position:30% line:89% align:start
(idyllic music)

00:05:05.048 --> 00:05:10.752 position:13% line:83% align:start
Thank you, I'm sure you've
combed out all the lice by now.

00:05:10.786 --> 00:05:14.956 position:7% line:83% align:start
Which means you're just combing
my hair because you like it.

00:05:18.692 --> 00:05:21.328 position:27% line:83% align:start
- We'll see about
that, won't we, Birk?

00:05:21.362 --> 00:05:23.230 position:21% line:89% align:start
- Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

00:05:28.901 --> 00:05:30.302 position:38% line:89% align:start
My hair,

00:05:30.335 --> 00:05:33.205 position:21% line:83% align:start
you're going to pull
it all out, Ronja.

00:05:33.238 --> 00:05:35.640 position:13% line:89% align:start
Can't you do it any softer?

00:05:40.344 --> 00:05:42.779 position:33% line:89% align:start
(both laugh)

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:58.326 position:16% line:83% align:start
- [Narrator] As the long
winter drew to a close,

00:05:58.359 --> 00:06:00.261 position:21% line:89% align:start
the days grew milder,

00:06:04.098 --> 00:06:05.265 position:30% line:89% align:start
and one day ...

00:06:21.812 --> 00:06:26.249 position:13% line:89% align:start
- [Robber] (shouting) Help!

00:06:26.283 --> 00:06:29.252 position:19% line:89% align:start
(Robbers all shouting)

00:06:31.221 --> 00:06:33.789 position:21% line:89% align:start
- Lovis, don't do it!

00:06:33.822 --> 00:06:36.291 position:19% line:83% align:start
- For crying out loud!
- It's wrong!

00:06:36.325 --> 00:06:38.059 position:24% line:89% align:start
- Have mercy on us!

00:06:39.428 --> 00:06:42.896 position:24% line:83% align:start
- Lovis, this'll be
bad for our health.

00:06:42.929 --> 00:06:44.332 position:10% line:89% align:start
You mustn't make us do this.

00:06:44.365 --> 00:06:45.665 position:30% line:89% align:start
- That's right!

00:06:45.699 --> 00:06:47.400 position:21% line:89% align:start
- Well said, Fjosok.

00:06:51.404 --> 00:06:53.906 position:10% line:89% align:start
- I don't wanna catch a cold.

00:06:53.939 --> 00:06:56.375 position:7% line:89% align:start
- Are you boys quite finished?

00:06:57.909 --> 00:06:59.744 position:16% line:89% align:start
- Now you listen to this,

00:06:59.777 --> 00:07:03.414 position:19% line:83% align:start
we're all gonna die of
cold, do you want that?

00:07:03.448 --> 00:07:06.116 position:35% line:83% align:start
- Exactly!
- That's right!

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:09.319 position:24% line:83% align:start
- Stirkas, you will
remove your headband.

00:07:13.422 --> 00:07:17.792 position:16% line:83% align:start
- But it was a gift from
my grandmother (sobbing)!

00:07:20.262 --> 00:07:22.364 position:27% line:83% align:start
- And the rest of
you, take everything

00:07:22.397 --> 00:07:24.832 position:19% line:89% align:start
off your heads as well.

00:07:24.865 --> 00:07:27.800 position:30% line:83% align:start
You can't wash
yourselves with those on.

00:07:27.834 --> 00:07:32.905 position:7% line:83% align:start
Jutis, Knotas, Pelje, come on!
(Robbers groan and whimper)

00:07:32.939 --> 00:07:37.176 position:21% line:83% align:start
- Lovis, I can't, you
know I can't do that.

00:07:37.209 --> 00:07:39.478 position:19% line:89% align:start
It would be horrifying.

00:07:39.511 --> 00:07:41.245 position:13% line:89% align:start
- [Robber] Horrifying, how?

00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:43.748 position:30% line:83% align:start
- [Fjosok] Too
horrifying to say.

00:07:43.781 --> 00:07:44.748 position:38% line:89% align:start
(groans)

00:07:44.781 --> 00:07:46.017 position:21% line:89% align:start
- Please have mercy!

00:07:46.050 --> 00:07:47.485 position:27% line:89% align:start
Don't cry, Pelje!

00:07:47.518 --> 00:07:50.353 position:19% line:83% align:start
- Even if it means you
will die of frostbite,

00:07:50.387 --> 00:07:53.156 position:16% line:83% align:start
you will clean yourselves
until the stench of winter

00:07:53.190 --> 00:07:56.325 position:16% line:83% align:start
is gone and I can breathe
through my nose again.

00:07:56.358 --> 00:07:58.227 position:19% line:89% align:start
Hurry up and get to it.

00:07:59.295 --> 00:08:02.063 position:30% line:89% align:start
(all shouting)

00:08:08.101 --> 00:08:10.404 position:33% line:89% align:start
(light music)

00:08:28.519 --> 00:08:30.853 position:10% line:89% align:start
- Water's ready, what's next?

00:08:30.887 --> 00:08:31.888 position:33% line:89% align:start
- We burn it.

00:08:35.857 --> 00:08:39.394 position:24% line:83% align:start
I'm only joking, we
bring it down for a wash.

00:08:42.364 --> 00:08:45.866 position:21% line:83% align:start
Ronja, you'll help me
with this, won't ya?

00:08:47.501 --> 00:08:49.103 position:24% line:89% align:start
- Of course I will.

00:08:55.575 --> 00:08:59.478 position:7% line:89% align:start
(all whimpering and shivering)

00:09:05.416 --> 00:09:06.850 position:30% line:89% align:start
- It's so cold!

00:09:08.253 --> 00:09:11.521 position:24% line:83% align:start
- Like I said, it's
bad for our health.

00:09:16.859 --> 00:09:19.495 position:24% line:83% align:start
- Bathing outside,
it's not right.

00:09:22.130 --> 00:09:25.300 position:24% line:83% align:start
- Lovis, she's more
evil than a harpy!

00:09:26.468 --> 00:09:29.336 position:5% line:89% align:start
Stench of winter, I'll show her.

00:09:33.006 --> 00:09:37.010 position:10% line:83% align:start
Curse that woman, if I could,
I'd throw this right at her!

00:09:37.043 --> 00:09:40.480 position:24% line:83% align:start
I'll remember this,
miserable maid troll.

00:09:40.513 --> 00:09:42.481 position:13% line:89% align:start
Nagging nag, she's a demon.

00:09:43.915 --> 00:09:46.551 position:21% line:83% align:start
- Housekeeping harpy!
- She-Wolf!

00:09:46.585 --> 00:09:48.219 position:21% line:89% align:start
- [Robber] Hell cat!

00:09:48.252 --> 00:09:49.553 position:24% line:89% align:start
- [Together] Demon!

00:09:52.356 --> 00:09:54.424 position:35% line:89% align:start
(laughing)

00:09:56.559 --> 00:09:58.328 position:24% line:89% align:start
- That was classic.

00:10:00.396 --> 00:10:04.466 position:16% line:83% align:start
- She certainly has a way
of getting things done.

00:10:09.203 --> 00:10:12.473 position:19% line:83% align:start
She's taken every last
strand of clothing from them,

00:10:12.507 --> 00:10:16.543 position:7% line:89% align:start
just like a robber (snickers).

00:10:23.249 --> 00:10:24.182 position:35% line:89% align:start
Oh, stinks.

00:10:37.060 --> 00:10:39.062 position:27% line:89% align:start
- How about you?

00:10:39.095 --> 00:10:41.397 position:13% line:83% align:start
Perhaps you think you don't
smell as bad as the rest,

00:10:41.431 --> 00:10:43.298 position:30% line:89% align:start
is that it, eh?

00:10:43.333 --> 00:10:47.369 position:27% line:83% align:start
- (laughs) Yeah,
something like that.

00:10:47.402 --> 00:10:50.004 position:5% line:89% align:start
Too cold for an old man like me.

00:10:51.405 --> 00:10:55.576 position:24% line:83% align:start
I won't die rolling
around naked in the snow.

00:10:55.609 --> 00:10:57.611 position:35% line:89% align:start
(grumbles)

00:10:57.645 --> 00:11:02.247 position:13% line:83% align:start
When I die, I wanna go with
the dirt I've got on me.

00:11:02.281 --> 00:11:03.882 position:21% line:89% align:start
I like my smell, hm?

00:11:08.654 --> 00:11:12.156 position:27% line:83% align:start
- Good, then you
can stay as you are

00:11:12.190 --> 00:11:14.157 position:10% line:89% align:start
and you can help me instead.

00:11:14.191 --> 00:11:16.360 position:24% line:83% align:start
Those robbers look
like wild goats,

00:11:16.393 --> 00:11:19.229 position:13% line:83% align:start
they need their messy hair
and their big beards cut.

00:11:19.262 --> 00:11:20.364 position:30% line:89% align:start
Can you do it?

00:11:21.498 --> 00:11:24.433 position:21% line:83% align:start
- 'Ey, I'll certainly
give it a go.

00:11:28.303 --> 00:11:30.305 position:21% line:89% align:start
I have one condition.

00:11:30.338 --> 00:11:35.476 position:13% line:83% align:start
I'm not cuttin' what little
I've got left up there.

00:11:35.509 --> 00:11:38.145 position:10% line:89% align:start
'Cause it's cold, down below.

00:11:38.178 --> 00:11:40.046 position:19% line:89% align:start
That's where I'm going.

00:11:41.314 --> 00:11:43.316 position:13% line:89% align:start
- Stop talking about dying!

00:11:45.418 --> 00:11:46.985 position:24% line:89% align:start
(laughs nervously)

00:11:47.018 --> 00:11:50.555 position:24% line:83% align:start
Old man, I haven't
lived a single day

00:11:50.589 --> 00:11:53.457 position:30% line:83% align:start
of this earthly
life without you,

00:11:54.458 --> 00:11:57.128 position:5% line:89% align:start
and I don't intend to start now.

00:11:58.329 --> 00:12:00.597 position:19% line:83% align:start
I won't let you go and
die behind my back.

00:12:00.630 --> 00:12:03.233 position:5% line:89% align:start
You remember that, you'd better.

00:12:06.602 --> 00:12:09.438 position:30% line:83% align:start
- We shall see,
we shall see, yes.

00:12:11.607 --> 00:12:17.344 position:16% line:89% align:start
(shouts) Oh, put me down!

00:12:24.984 --> 00:12:25.618 position:41% line:89% align:start
- Mhm.

00:12:30.054 --> 00:12:33.224 position:21% line:89% align:start
(hysterical laughing)

00:13:00.714 --> 00:13:03.583 position:30% line:89% align:start
(comical music)

00:13:24.634 --> 00:13:25.669 position:38% line:89% align:start
- Fjosok.

00:13:36.611 --> 00:13:38.245 position:27% line:89% align:start
- Right, come on.

00:13:49.555 --> 00:13:52.123 position:7% line:89% align:start
- Why do we have to wear these?

00:13:55.694 --> 00:13:58.162 position:35% line:89% align:start
(laughing)

00:14:10.773 --> 00:14:14.376 position:16% line:89% align:start
(Mattis and Ronja laugh)

00:14:19.814 --> 00:14:22.717 position:19% line:83% align:start
- Sorry, I didn't mean
to laugh this much.

00:14:22.750 --> 00:14:26.820 position:21% line:83% align:start
You all look splendid
in your new attire.

00:14:26.853 --> 00:14:28.321 position:5% line:89% align:start
It's just the only clean clothes

00:14:28.355 --> 00:14:30.623 position:10% line:89% align:start
we have are women's clothes.

00:14:33.559 --> 00:14:36.729 position:21% line:89% align:start
(laughs uproariously)

00:15:02.116 --> 00:15:04.285 position:13% line:89% align:start
- Now boys, let's make up.

00:15:07.688 --> 00:15:10.557 position:30% line:89% align:start
(excited moans)

00:15:19.130 --> 00:15:21.465 position:35% line:89% align:start
(all cheer)

00:15:36.879 --> 00:15:39.748 position:30% line:89% align:start
(festive music)

00:16:23.719 --> 00:16:26.220 position:33% line:89% align:start
(birds chirp)

00:16:36.595 --> 00:16:39.164 position:30% line:89% align:start
(water rushes)

00:16:41.834 --> 00:16:45.236 position:30% line:89% align:start
(rooster crows)

00:16:45.269 --> 00:16:47.872 position:30% line:89% align:start
(horses whinny)

00:16:55.946 --> 00:16:59.882 position:24% line:83% align:start
- Finally, back to
the life of a robber.

00:16:59.915 --> 00:17:01.349 position:24% line:89% align:start
- Just can't wait.

00:17:03.351 --> 00:17:08.422 position:19% line:83% align:start
- Boys, we're not going
out there to muck about.

00:17:08.455 --> 00:17:10.824 position:21% line:83% align:start
For many generations,
from my grandfather

00:17:10.858 --> 00:17:14.727 position:13% line:83% align:start
to my great-grandfather, to
my great-great grandfather,

00:17:14.761 --> 00:17:17.363 position:19% line:83% align:start
Mattis' Robbers have--
- Mattis!

00:17:20.332 --> 00:17:21.667 position:27% line:89% align:start
Mattis, hold on!

00:17:28.406 --> 00:17:34.511 position:21% line:83% align:start
Mattis, remember, you
made a promise to me.

00:17:34.544 --> 00:17:36.946 position:21% line:89% align:start
It's time to keep it.

00:17:36.980 --> 00:17:39.748 position:30% line:83% align:start
I want to go to
the forest, please.

00:17:39.782 --> 00:17:41.450 position:13% line:89% align:start
- I may have promised that,

00:17:41.483 --> 00:17:44.653 position:27% line:83% align:start
so as a man of my
word, it will happen.

00:17:47.488 --> 00:17:50.591 position:21% line:83% align:start
- Thank you very much
for keeping to your word.

00:17:50.625 --> 00:17:53.493 position:16% line:83% align:start
I know that you said that
the forest is most dangerous

00:17:53.527 --> 00:17:55.696 position:13% line:89% align:start
between winter and spring,

00:17:55.729 --> 00:17:58.831 position:19% line:83% align:start
but it's not that time
of year anymore, is it?

00:17:58.864 --> 00:17:59.832 position:41% line:89% align:start
Is it?

00:18:03.969 --> 00:18:06.538 position:7% line:89% align:start
- Well, I suppose you're right.

00:18:06.571 --> 00:18:07.772 position:41% line:89% align:start
- Yep.

00:18:07.806 --> 00:18:12.576 position:10% line:83% align:start
- But listen, don't drown in
a pool or fall in a ravine.

00:18:12.609 --> 00:18:14.445 position:13% line:89% align:start
Just take care of yourself,

00:18:14.478 --> 00:18:18.915 position:19% line:83% align:start
your mother would never
let me hear the end of it.

00:18:18.948 --> 00:18:21.551 position:5% line:89% align:start
- How about I just break my leg?

00:18:25.620 --> 00:18:29.024 position:16% line:83% align:start
And that way, it'll give
you a reason to get angry

00:18:29.057 --> 00:18:33.694 position:7% line:83% align:start
and shout your head off, 'cause
that's what you like to do.

00:18:33.728 --> 00:18:37.997 position:41% line:83% align:start
(sighs)
(Ronja giggles)

00:18:38.031 --> 00:18:39.799 position:19% line:89% align:start
- Oh, my little Ronja.

00:18:44.470 --> 00:18:46.972 position:33% line:89% align:start
(Mattis sobs)

00:18:55.312 --> 00:18:57.581 position:30% line:89% align:start
Let's go, yah!

00:19:11.391 --> 00:19:13.928 position:27% line:89% align:start
(majestic music)

00:19:16.630 --> 00:19:19.298 position:30% line:89% align:start
(sings happily)

00:19:35.846 --> 00:19:39.349 position:16% line:89% align:start
(buoyant, cheerful music)

00:19:54.595 --> 00:19:55.997 position:24% line:89% align:start
- Smells wonderful.

00:19:59.466 --> 00:20:02.401 position:35% line:89% align:start
(whistles)

00:20:02.434 --> 00:20:05.037 position:30% line:89% align:start
(birds whistle)

00:20:10.675 --> 00:20:14.612 position:7% line:89% align:start
And good day to you (giggles).

00:20:34.162 --> 00:20:35.930 position:24% line:89% align:start
So good to see you.

00:20:46.538 --> 00:20:49.374 position:27% line:89% align:start
(laughs joyously)

00:21:49.558 --> 00:21:50.893 position:27% line:89% align:start
Birk, over here!

00:21:54.563 --> 00:21:58.032 position:24% line:83% align:start
- Well, it's about
time you showed up!

00:21:58.065 --> 00:22:00.101 position:38% line:89% align:start
(laughs)

00:22:16.781 --> 00:22:20.018 position:16% line:89% align:start
(sings a sustained note)

00:22:27.723 --> 00:22:31.027 position:16% line:89% align:start
(sings at a higher pitch)

00:22:38.867 --> 00:22:43.037 position:27% line:83% align:start
(yells fiercely)
(geese honk)

00:22:50.510 --> 00:22:51.678 position:33% line:89% align:start
- How's that?

00:22:51.711 --> 00:22:53.979 position:33% line:83% align:start
I call it my
special spring yell.

00:22:54.012 --> 00:22:58.850 position:27% line:83% align:start
Gets rid of that
old winter, gone!

00:22:58.884 --> 00:22:59.917 position:35% line:89% align:start
(snickers)

00:22:59.951 --> 00:23:00.885 position:35% line:89% align:start
Now, ready?

00:23:00.918 --> 00:23:02.787 position:16% line:89% align:start
One more time to be sure.

00:23:06.057 --> 00:23:08.058 position:41% line:89% align:start
(yells)

00:23:12.761 --> 00:23:15.864 position:19% line:83% align:start
- [Narrator] Spring had
arrived in the forest,

00:23:15.898 --> 00:23:17.199 position:24% line:89% align:start
the spring of life.

00:23:22.603 --> 00:23:26.106 position:24% line:83% align:start
Next time on Ronja,
the Robber's Daughter.

00:23:30.643 --> 00:23:31.978 position:24% line:89% align:start
"Splendid Spring".

00:23:33.913 --> 00:23:35.881 position:30% line:89% align:start
Don't miss it.

00:23:35.915 --> 00:23:38.150 position:33% line:89% align:start
(light music)
