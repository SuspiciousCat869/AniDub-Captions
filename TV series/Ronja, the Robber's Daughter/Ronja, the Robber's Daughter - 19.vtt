00:01:38.175 --> 00:01:40.312 position:35% line:89% align:start
(screaming)

00:01:40.345 --> 00:01:42.581 position:16% line:83% align:start
- [Narrator] On the first
day that Ronja and Birk

00:01:42.615 --> 00:01:45.851 position:19% line:83% align:start
moved into the forest,
they worked constantly

00:01:45.885 --> 00:01:47.621 position:21% line:89% align:start
and the time flew by.

00:01:47.654 --> 00:01:50.157 position:16% line:89% align:start
(bouncy orchestral music)

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:53.628 position:27% line:83% align:start
That night, Ronja
thought of Mattis' fort

00:01:53.661 --> 00:01:58.367 position:16% line:83% align:start
and she missed it so much
her heart was in pain.

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:02.038 position:19% line:83% align:start
She dreamt that Mattis
was sitting alone,

00:02:02.072 --> 00:02:04.040 position:19% line:89% align:start
crying a pool of tears.

00:02:04.074 --> 00:02:08.112 position:27% line:83% align:start
(lively flute and
orchestral music)

00:02:17.124 --> 00:02:21.096 position:27% line:83% align:start
(birds chirping)
(lively music)

00:02:23.399 --> 00:02:27.571 position:30% line:83% align:start
(grunting hums)
(laughing)

00:02:36.047 --> 00:02:38.183 position:24% line:83% align:start
- Come on, Birk, we
need to haul the fish in

00:02:38.217 --> 00:02:40.520 position:24% line:83% align:start
before the cuckoos
start callin'.

00:02:40.553 --> 00:02:44.191 position:16% line:89% align:start
(lively orchestral music)

00:02:53.002 --> 00:02:58.041 position:10% line:83% align:start
- How can you be this lively
at such an early hour?

00:02:58.075 --> 00:02:59.644 position:10% line:89% align:start
I'm sure we don't catch any.

00:02:59.677 --> 00:03:02.581 position:27% line:83% align:start
Bet the fish are
still asleep as well.

00:03:02.615 --> 00:03:04.417 position:35% line:89% align:start
(laughing)

00:03:05.518 --> 00:03:08.455 position:27% line:83% align:start
- There's so much
salmon in our river.

00:03:08.488 --> 00:03:11.124 position:13% line:83% align:start
It would be very odd if we
hadn't caught at least one

00:03:11.158 --> 00:03:13.194 position:21% line:89% align:start
in our net, let's go.

00:03:13.227 --> 00:03:14.663 position:24% line:89% align:start
Come on, hurry up!

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:19.302 position:13% line:89% align:start
- I'll tell you what's odd.

00:03:19.335 --> 00:03:21.171 position:7% line:89% align:start
You skippin' around like that.

00:03:21.204 --> 00:03:22.606 position:30% line:83% align:start
You'll go head
first into the river

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:24.575 position:13% line:89% align:start
and get caught in our net.

00:03:24.608 --> 00:03:28.713 position:24% line:83% align:start
(lively orchestral
and flute music)

00:03:35.021 --> 00:03:37.324 position:7% line:89% align:start
- I call this spring skipping.

00:03:39.327 --> 00:03:41.162 position:19% line:89% align:start
- Spring skipping, ay?

00:03:47.504 --> 00:03:50.441 position:13% line:83% align:start
That was a well worn path,
almost like it was made

00:03:50.475 --> 00:03:52.543 position:21% line:89% align:start
for spring skipping.

00:03:52.577 --> 00:03:55.714 position:27% line:83% align:start
Who do you think
first trot it down?

00:03:55.747 --> 00:03:58.383 position:16% line:89% align:start
- Perhaps it was Mattis.

00:03:58.418 --> 00:04:00.053 position:41% line:89% align:start
- Ugh.

00:04:00.086 --> 00:04:03.089 position:16% line:83% align:start
- Back when he was living
in the bear's cave.

00:04:03.122 --> 00:04:04.725 position:19% line:89% align:start
He really loves salmon.

00:04:06.495 --> 00:04:09.564 position:30% line:83% align:start
He always has,
although that's why...

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:14.805 position:38% line:89% align:start
- Ronja.

00:04:14.838 --> 00:04:17.307 position:35% line:89% align:start
(splashing)

00:04:23.282 --> 00:04:25.384 position:38% line:89% align:start
(laughs)

00:04:25.417 --> 00:04:28.688 position:27% line:89% align:start
(delightful gasp)

00:04:28.722 --> 00:04:33.027 position:27% line:83% align:start
(birds chirping)
(animals chattering)

00:04:47.879 --> 00:04:52.318 position:10% line:83% align:start
Sister mine, you're certainly
not gonna die of hunger.

00:04:52.351 --> 00:04:53.687 position:24% line:89% align:start
I promise you that.

00:04:55.422 --> 00:04:57.825 position:10% line:89% align:start
- Well, not until the winter.

00:05:00.763 --> 00:05:03.165 position:35% line:89% align:start
(groaning)

00:05:03.198 --> 00:05:07.237 position:13% line:83% align:start
But there's no use worrying
about something so far away.

00:05:08.873 --> 00:05:09.707 position:47% line:89% align:start
Oh.

00:05:12.577 --> 00:05:14.413 position:19% line:89% align:start
Birk, you're bleeding.

00:05:16.315 --> 00:05:19.419 position:21% line:83% align:start
- I was trimming the
birch and the ax slipped.

00:05:19.452 --> 00:05:22.255 position:10% line:89% align:start
It's nothing to worry about.

00:05:22.288 --> 00:05:25.426 position:19% line:83% align:start
To heal well, the wound
has to finish bleedin' out,

00:05:25.459 --> 00:05:28.597 position:19% line:83% align:start
and then you know it's
clean and will heal itself.

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:30.298 position:27% line:89% align:start
- Don't be silly.

00:05:30.333 --> 00:05:34.471 position:5% line:83% align:start
A killer bear might be following
the scent of your blood.

00:05:34.504 --> 00:05:36.206 position:35% line:89% align:start
(laughing)

00:05:37.508 --> 00:05:40.345 position:19% line:83% align:start
- [Birk] Then I'd take
care of 'em with my spear.

00:05:40.378 --> 00:05:41.747 position:33% line:89% align:start
Yes I would.

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:44.249 position:10% line:89% align:start
- You know, Lovis usually...

00:05:45.919 --> 00:05:48.388 position:10% line:89% align:start
Lovis usually puts dried moss

00:05:48.421 --> 00:05:51.192 position:30% line:83% align:start
on the wound to
stop the bleeding.

00:05:53.394 --> 00:05:56.933 position:19% line:83% align:start
I think I better get us
a good supply of moss.

00:05:56.966 --> 00:05:59.369 position:21% line:83% align:start
Who knows when you're
plannin' on cuttin' yourself

00:05:59.402 --> 00:06:00.738 position:27% line:89% align:start
on the leg again?

00:06:02.205 --> 00:06:04.508 position:35% line:83% align:start
(laughing)
(strumming music)

00:06:04.541 --> 00:06:08.546 position:19% line:83% align:start
- [Birk] Good point, we
might need a lot of moss.

00:06:10.383 --> 00:06:13.419 position:19% line:89% align:start
(lively, bouncy music)

00:06:21.497 --> 00:06:23.432 position:38% line:89% align:start
(laughs)

00:06:23.465 --> 00:06:26.201 position:30% line:89% align:start
(lively music)

00:06:28.839 --> 00:06:33.210 position:35% line:83% align:start
(clanking)
(lively music)

00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:47.262 position:35% line:83% align:start
(scraping)
(lively music)

00:07:09.824 --> 00:07:13.995 position:24% line:83% align:start
(flames crackling)
(lively music)

00:07:26.911 --> 00:07:29.280 position:38% line:89% align:start
(sighing)

00:07:36.323 --> 00:07:38.793 position:30% line:89% align:start
(flowing water)

00:07:40.394 --> 00:07:44.067 position:16% line:83% align:start
- [Narrator] By the third
day, Ronja was asking.

00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:47.504 position:27% line:83% align:start
- Birk, which do
you think is worse?

00:07:47.537 --> 00:07:52.543 position:24% line:83% align:start
Eating salmon every
day, every mealtime,

00:07:52.577 --> 00:07:55.047 position:5% line:89% align:start
or blisters all over your hands?

00:07:56.616 --> 00:08:01.755 position:21% line:83% align:start
- Hmm, I'd say one is
as bad as the other.

00:08:07.595 --> 00:08:09.632 position:35% line:89% align:start
(grumbles)

00:08:10.833 --> 00:08:13.603 position:21% line:83% align:start
But I tell ya, there
is one thing I know,

00:08:13.637 --> 00:08:15.106 position:27% line:89% align:start
we need a chisel.

00:08:15.139 --> 00:08:19.710 position:16% line:83% align:start
I can't believe I didn't
think about bringing one.

00:08:19.745 --> 00:08:23.750 position:21% line:83% align:start
Makin' this bowl was
impossible without a chisel.

00:08:25.952 --> 00:08:30.524 position:19% line:83% align:start
Now, I need to sharpen
the knife yet again.

00:08:30.558 --> 00:08:32.894 position:10% line:89% align:start
Can I have the knife, Ronja?

00:08:34.563 --> 00:08:35.932 position:35% line:89% align:start
- What now?

00:08:35.965 --> 00:08:38.734 position:10% line:89% align:start
I thought you had the knife.

00:08:38.768 --> 00:08:41.572 position:16% line:89% align:start
- No, you were usin' it.

00:08:41.605 --> 00:08:42.840 position:27% line:89% align:start
You had it last.

00:08:42.873 --> 00:08:44.408 position:27% line:89% align:start
Now hand it over.

00:08:46.444 --> 00:08:49.615 position:21% line:83% align:start
- I will not, because
you had it last.

00:08:51.483 --> 00:08:52.652 position:24% line:89% align:start
Didn't you hear me?

00:08:52.686 --> 00:08:54.922 position:19% line:89% align:start
What's wrong with you?

00:08:54.956 --> 00:08:58.526 position:24% line:83% align:start
- Come on, what've
you done with it then?

00:09:01.430 --> 00:09:06.103 position:30% line:83% align:start
- What have you
done with it then?!

00:09:06.136 --> 00:09:08.739 position:35% line:89% align:start
(groaning)

00:09:08.772 --> 00:09:12.409 position:27% line:83% align:start
If you remember,
brother, you had it last!

00:09:13.578 --> 00:09:15.614 position:19% line:89% align:start
- That's a stupid lie.

00:09:15.647 --> 00:09:17.950 position:35% line:89% align:start
(groaning)

00:09:17.984 --> 00:09:21.088 position:16% line:83% align:start
I thought I told you how
important that knife is.

00:09:21.121 --> 00:09:24.893 position:21% line:83% align:start
Without it, we can't
manage here in the woods.

00:09:26.527 --> 00:09:30.499 position:13% line:83% align:start
- Well then, you should've
taken better care of it.

00:09:33.837 --> 00:09:36.173 position:10% line:89% align:start
Birk, you know what you are?

00:09:37.475 --> 00:09:39.510 position:24% line:83% align:start
You're a mean devil
blamin' others

00:09:39.543 --> 00:09:41.546 position:19% line:89% align:start
when it's you at fault!

00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:45.685 position:35% line:83% align:start
(stomping)
(huffing groans)

00:09:48.756 --> 00:09:49.590 position:41% line:89% align:start
- So...

00:09:52.661 --> 00:09:56.499 position:19% line:83% align:start
I see that you're back
again to your old ways.

00:09:58.902 --> 00:10:03.074 position:10% line:83% align:start
Right back to the old Ronja,
the robber's daughter.

00:10:04.809 --> 00:10:09.181 position:24% line:83% align:start
And I'm supposed to
live in here with you?

00:10:09.215 --> 00:10:13.019 position:21% line:83% align:start
- So don't you worry
about that, Borka robber.

00:10:13.053 --> 00:10:15.923 position:24% line:83% align:start
Why don't you live
here all by yourself

00:10:15.957 --> 00:10:20.062 position:16% line:83% align:start
with your precious little
knife if you can find it,

00:10:21.730 --> 00:10:26.636 position:13% line:83% align:start
which you will, because for
the last time, you lost it!

00:10:26.669 --> 00:10:28.739 position:38% line:89% align:start
(crying)

00:10:35.114 --> 00:10:38.617 position:21% line:83% align:start
- I hope the harpies
take you away!

00:10:38.651 --> 00:10:40.520 position:10% line:89% align:start
You're actin' just like them.

00:10:40.554 --> 00:10:42.489 position:16% line:89% align:start
You'll be quite at home!

(huffing groans)

00:10:52.802 --> 00:10:54.305 position:21% line:83% align:start
- [Ronja Voiceover] I
think I better get us

00:10:54.338 --> 00:10:56.841 position:19% line:89% align:start
a good supply of moss.

00:10:56.874 --> 00:10:59.644 position:21% line:83% align:start
Who knows when you're
plannin' on cuttin' yourself

00:10:59.678 --> 00:11:00.846 position:27% line:89% align:start
on the leg again?

00:11:02.581 --> 00:11:04.884 position:24% line:89% align:start
- Use moss, stupid!

00:11:04.917 --> 00:11:07.221 position:33% line:89% align:start
(fluttering)

00:11:07.254 --> 00:11:09.190 position:41% line:89% align:start
(gasps)

00:11:14.330 --> 00:11:15.164 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmm.

00:11:18.168 --> 00:11:19.169 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmm.

00:11:19.202 --> 00:11:21.838 position:27% line:89% align:start
(bouncy drumming)

00:11:21.872 --> 00:11:25.978 position:19% line:89% align:start

(scraping)

00:11:41.763 --> 00:11:45.868 position:21% line:83% align:start
- Why don't you live
here all by yourself?

00:11:45.903 --> 00:11:49.840 position:19% line:83% align:start
- Where does she think
she's going to live then?

00:11:51.276 --> 00:11:54.880 position:21% line:83% align:start
As far as I care, she
could go back to wherever

00:11:54.914 --> 00:11:59.953 position:13% line:83% align:start
it is she wants to go, but
she's not welcome in this cave.

00:11:59.986 --> 00:12:00.821 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmm.

00:12:03.424 --> 00:12:06.728 position:24% line:83% align:start
If she were to come
back, sorry and pleading,

00:12:06.762 --> 00:12:08.030 position:19% line:89% align:start
then I would tell her,

00:12:10.100 --> 00:12:11.367 position:35% line:89% align:start
I'm sorry,

00:12:11.401 --> 00:12:14.071 position:7% line:89% align:start
but your apology's not welcome.

00:12:14.105 --> 00:12:15.873 position:19% line:89% align:start
It's too late for you.

00:12:21.180 --> 00:12:22.315 position:41% line:89% align:start

00:12:22.348 --> 00:12:24.750 position:35% line:89% align:start
(thudding)

00:12:34.930 --> 00:12:38.034 position:7% line:89% align:start
It's not as if I drove her out.

00:12:38.068 --> 00:12:40.704 position:24% line:89% align:start
(sniffling breaths)

(birds squawking)
(lively chiming music)

00:13:50.158 --> 00:13:51.926 position:24% line:89% align:start
- I'm coming, wait!

00:13:55.030 --> 00:13:55.864 position:38% line:89% align:start
- Ronja!

00:13:59.002 --> 00:14:00.171 position:33% line:89% align:start
- Let me go!

00:14:00.204 --> 00:14:03.375 position:19% line:89% align:start
(lively chiming music)

00:14:04.409 --> 00:14:06.445 position:16% line:89% align:start
- Well, I don't know you.

00:14:07.879 --> 00:14:08.948 position:30% line:89% align:start
What happened?

00:14:08.982 --> 00:14:10.383 position:16% line:89% align:start
Were you bitten by a fox?

00:14:10.416 --> 00:14:13.120 position:24% line:83% align:start
(sobs) Please don't
ever leave me!

00:14:13.153 --> 00:14:15.155 position:16% line:89% align:start
Please do not ever leave!

00:14:15.189 --> 00:14:17.158 position:24% line:89% align:start
And I'll help you.

00:14:17.192 --> 00:14:19.462 position:16% line:89% align:start
My brother won't starve.

00:14:19.495 --> 00:14:22.031 position:30% line:89% align:start
(wind blowing)

00:14:26.837 --> 00:14:28.940 position:30% line:89% align:start

00:14:53.203 --> 00:14:55.039 position:38% line:89% align:start
- Ronja!

00:14:56.074 --> 00:15:00.045 position:10% line:89% align:start
(lively, somber flute music)

00:15:02.549 --> 00:15:03.383 position:41% line:89% align:start
Ronja!

00:15:04.985 --> 00:15:08.956 position:10% line:89% align:start
(lively, somber flute music)

00:15:11.092 --> 00:15:12.461 position:41% line:89% align:start
Ronja!

00:15:13.996 --> 00:15:15.030 position:41% line:89% align:start
Ronja!

00:15:16.031 --> 00:15:19.969 position:10% line:89% align:start
(lively, somber flute music)

00:15:35.055 --> 00:15:37.626 position:27% line:89% align:start

(lively flute and
strumming music)

00:15:49.173 --> 00:15:52.144 position:24% line:83% align:start
Of course, I really
should've known.

00:15:52.177 --> 00:15:56.916 position:13% line:83% align:start
She may be sister mine, but
he'll always be her father.

00:15:56.950 --> 00:15:59.453 position:27% line:89% align:start
(horse neighing)

00:16:03.525 --> 00:16:04.359 position:47% line:89% align:start
Oh.

00:16:05.994 --> 00:16:08.164 position:35% line:89% align:start
(neighing)

00:16:08.197 --> 00:16:11.201 position:33% line:89% align:start
(sputtering)

00:16:11.235 --> 00:16:12.102 position:35% line:89% align:start
Poor thing.

00:16:17.075 --> 00:16:19.077 position:41% line:89% align:start
(gasps)

00:16:20.679 --> 00:16:21.514 position:41% line:89% align:start
- Birk.

00:16:23.250 --> 00:16:24.084 position:38% line:89% align:start
- Ronja.

00:16:25.352 --> 00:16:28.156 position:19% line:89% align:start
- Did you see the bear?

00:16:28.189 --> 00:16:34.129 position:13% line:83% align:start
He just attacked this poor
horse and killed her foal.

00:16:34.163 --> 00:16:36.266 position:38% line:89% align:start
(crying)

00:16:45.343 --> 00:16:47.980 position:33% line:89% align:start
(sputtering)

00:16:54.288 --> 00:16:55.757 position:41% line:89% align:start
(gasps)

00:16:55.790 --> 00:16:57.292 position:27% line:89% align:start
We need the moss.

00:16:57.325 --> 00:16:59.261 position:19% line:89% align:start
Can you go and get it?

00:16:59.295 --> 00:17:02.998 position:19% line:83% align:start
- Yes, although, with a
bear somewhere nearby,

00:17:03.032 --> 00:17:04.167 position:19% line:89% align:start
come on, it's not safe.

00:17:04.201 --> 00:17:06.136 position:16% line:89% align:start
I can't leave you alone.

00:17:06.169 --> 00:17:07.138 position:30% line:89% align:start
- Just go, now!

00:17:08.774 --> 00:17:11.210 position:33% line:89% align:start
(sputtering)

00:17:13.212 --> 00:17:16.282 position:27% line:83% align:start
I must stay here
and comfort her.

00:17:16.316 --> 00:17:19.720 position:21% line:83% align:start
We need to look after
her and help her recover.

00:17:19.753 --> 00:17:23.291 position:27% line:89% align:start
(bird squawking)

00:17:23.325 --> 00:17:26.228 position:24% line:83% align:start
We need to get the
moss right now!

00:17:26.261 --> 00:17:27.196 position:33% line:89% align:start
- Oh, right.

00:17:28.297 --> 00:17:31.335 position:27% line:89% align:start
(panting breaths)

00:17:33.170 --> 00:17:36.241 position:19% line:89% align:start
(bouncy, lively music)

00:17:54.330 --> 00:17:57.166 position:30% line:83% align:start
- What are they
doing with horse?

00:17:57.200 --> 00:17:57.768 position:38% line:89% align:start
For what?

00:18:00.304 --> 00:18:03.542 position:21% line:83% align:start
- [Two Rumphobs] What
for are they doing?

00:18:04.877 --> 00:18:06.646 position:33% line:89% align:start
(elated gasp)

00:18:06.679 --> 00:18:07.513 position:35% line:89% align:start
- Rumphobs.

00:18:11.552 --> 00:18:13.721 position:13% line:89% align:start
That means we're safe now.

00:18:13.755 --> 00:18:18.159 position:21% line:83% align:start
Bears can't stand the
smell of shadow-folk.

00:18:18.192 --> 00:18:19.328 position:13% line:89% align:start
- No wonder she's so calm.

00:18:19.361 --> 00:18:21.698 position:19% line:89% align:start
It's better down here.

00:18:21.731 --> 00:18:23.633 position:35% line:83% align:start
(laughing)
(lively music)

00:18:23.667 --> 00:18:27.271 position:30% line:83% align:start
- What for are
they human smiling?

00:18:27.305 --> 00:18:30.542 position:27% line:83% align:start
- [Both] What for
are they smiling?

00:18:30.576 --> 00:18:34.213 position:16% line:89% align:start
(lively orchestral music)

00:18:41.856 --> 00:18:44.292 position:35% line:89% align:start
(giggling)

00:18:45.861 --> 00:18:49.365 position:16% line:89% align:start
(lively orchestral music)

00:18:56.474 --> 00:18:59.445 position:27% line:89% align:start
(birds chirping)

00:19:14.564 --> 00:19:15.398 position:44% line:89% align:start
- Oh.

00:19:20.437 --> 00:19:22.540 position:38% line:89% align:start
(laughs)

00:19:27.279 --> 00:19:29.281 position:41% line:89% align:start
(gasps)

00:19:35.390 --> 00:19:37.893 position:19% line:89% align:start
- The bleeding stopped.

00:19:37.926 --> 00:19:39.863 position:16% line:89% align:start
And the moss is dry too.

00:19:45.235 --> 00:19:49.408 position:10% line:83% align:start
Go on, if you keep drinking,
you'll feel much better soon.

00:19:49.441 --> 00:19:51.443 position:38% line:89% align:start
(gulping)

00:19:52.712 --> 00:19:54.714 position:19% line:83% align:start
- Until her wound's all
healed, let's keep her

00:19:54.747 --> 00:19:56.950 position:27% line:89% align:start
here by the pond.

00:19:56.984 --> 00:19:57.951 position:30% line:89% align:start
She'll be safe.

00:19:57.985 --> 00:20:00.487 position:19% line:89% align:start
No bears'll come here.

00:20:00.522 --> 00:20:02.891 position:24% line:83% align:start
- Don't grieve too
much, sweet mom.

00:20:02.925 --> 00:20:05.293 position:27% line:83% align:start
I'm sure that by
the next springtime,

00:20:05.327 --> 00:20:06.595 position:19% line:89% align:start
you'll have a new baby.

00:20:06.629 --> 00:20:09.265 position:33% line:89% align:start
(splattering)

00:20:11.468 --> 00:20:12.302 position:35% line:89% align:start
Look, milk.

00:20:13.538 --> 00:20:18.277 position:21% line:83% align:start
It was meant for her
foal, that's ever so sad.

00:20:18.310 --> 00:20:20.613 position:21% line:83% align:start
If you want, you can
give it to us instead.

00:20:20.647 --> 00:20:22.816 position:35% line:89% align:start
(sniffing)

00:20:24.350 --> 00:20:27.321 position:19% line:83% align:start
- She's our horse now,
we must give her a name.

00:20:27.354 --> 00:20:29.658 position:27% line:83% align:start
What do you think
she should be called?

00:20:31.293 --> 00:20:31.928 position:41% line:89% align:start
- Lia.

00:20:33.463 --> 00:20:35.565 position:30% line:89% align:start
How about Lia?

00:20:35.598 --> 00:20:37.468 position:10% line:89% align:start
That's a great name for her.

00:20:37.501 --> 00:20:39.871 position:13% line:83% align:start
Mattis once told me that he
had a mare with that name

00:20:39.904 --> 00:20:41.706 position:24% line:89% align:start
when he was a boy.

00:20:41.740 --> 00:20:43.008 position:30% line:89% align:start
- Mmm, Lia huh?

00:20:44.510 --> 00:20:45.711 position:27% line:89% align:start
I like that name.

00:20:50.450 --> 00:20:51.485 position:44% line:89% align:start
Lia.

00:20:54.822 --> 00:20:58.293 position:19% line:89% align:start
(lively chiming music)

00:20:59.929 --> 00:21:03.033 position:21% line:89% align:start
(lively flute music)

00:21:21.022 --> 00:21:24.325 position:24% line:83% align:start
- It's a pity that
we lost our knife.

00:21:26.595 --> 00:21:30.767 position:30% line:83% align:start
(lively music)
(gulping)

00:21:36.675 --> 00:21:38.510 position:41% line:89% align:start
(gasps)

00:21:38.544 --> 00:21:41.581 position:21% line:89% align:start
(lively flute music)

00:21:43.784 --> 00:21:46.855 position:16% line:83% align:start
- [Birk] But, it's a good
thing we found it again.

00:21:46.888 --> 00:21:48.657 position:41% line:89% align:start
- Huh?

00:21:48.690 --> 00:21:51.661 position:13% line:83% align:start
- While we were arguin' and
bein' mean to each other,

00:21:51.694 --> 00:21:53.663 position:7% line:89% align:start
it was right there all the time

00:21:53.696 --> 00:21:56.133 position:7% line:89% align:start
just waiting for us to find it.

00:21:56.166 --> 00:21:59.369 position:21% line:89% align:start
(lively flute music)

00:22:03.408 --> 00:22:05.744 position:7% line:89% align:start
- Brother, I've been thinking,

00:22:05.778 --> 00:22:08.114 position:10% line:89% align:start
ever since we had that fight,

00:22:12.053 --> 00:22:15.591 position:21% line:83% align:start
it's silly, so before
we have another one,

00:22:15.624 --> 00:22:19.863 position:16% line:83% align:start
let's make sure that it's
an argument worth having.

00:22:19.896 --> 00:22:21.397 position:24% line:89% align:start
Don't you think so?

00:22:22.632 --> 00:22:25.436 position:21% line:83% align:start
- Well in that case,
we'll have to make sure

00:22:25.469 --> 00:22:27.939 position:33% line:83% align:start
to avoid any
pointless arguments.

00:22:30.475 --> 00:22:33.679 position:19% line:83% align:start
But Ronja, do you know
what I was thinking

00:22:33.713 --> 00:22:35.649 position:16% line:89% align:start
just after you ran away?

00:22:37.117 --> 00:22:37.952 position:41% line:89% align:start
- Hmm?

00:22:42.523 --> 00:22:44.159 position:27% line:89% align:start
- I'll tell you.

00:22:44.193 --> 00:22:48.498 position:10% line:83% align:start
I realized you're worth more
to me than a 1,000 knives.

00:22:49.900 --> 00:22:50.735 position:41% line:89% align:start
- Hmm.

00:22:52.870 --> 00:22:55.841 position:16% line:83% align:start
You know, Birk Borkason,
I honestly think

00:22:55.874 --> 00:22:59.045 position:30% line:83% align:start
you're about as
crazy as they come.

00:22:59.078 --> 00:23:01.447 position:35% line:89% align:start
(laughing)

00:23:06.721 --> 00:23:08.189 position:19% line:83% align:start
- [Narrator] When they
recalled that Lovis

00:23:08.223 --> 00:23:11.928 position:19% line:83% align:start
sometimes said this to
Mattis, it made them laugh

00:23:11.961 --> 00:23:16.466 position:19% line:83% align:start
and they couldn't stop
laughing for quite some time.

00:23:16.500 --> 00:23:18.703 position:35% line:89% align:start
(laughing)

00:23:21.005 --> 00:23:22.908 position:24% line:89% align:start
(bouncy folk music)

00:23:22.942 --> 00:23:25.744 position:21% line:83% align:start
Next time, on Ronja,
the Robber's Daughter.

00:23:25.778 --> 00:23:29.616 position:7% line:89% align:start
(bouncy, energetic folk music)

00:23:30.751 --> 00:23:32.720 position:19% line:89% align:start
"With the Wild Horses".

00:23:34.256 --> 00:23:36.124 position:30% line:89% align:start
Don't miss it.

00:23:36.158 --> 00:23:40.463 position:19% line:83% align:start
(lively, bouncy music)
(chiming)

00:25:01.832 --> 00:25:05.636 position:13% line:89% align:start
(lively acoustic strumming)
