(sobbing)

00:01:41.942 --> 00:01:43.944 position:19% line:83% align:start
- [Narrator] The first
frost of winter came.

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:48.381 position:24% line:83% align:start
And Ronja and Birk
knew that it was time

00:01:48.415 --> 00:01:51.450 position:24% line:83% align:start
to leave the bear's
cave and go home.

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.288 position:10% line:89% align:start
Mattis' fort and Borka's Keep

00:01:57.321 --> 00:01:59.891 position:27% line:83% align:start
were filled with
an overwhelming joy

00:01:59.925 --> 00:02:03.260 position:24% line:83% align:start
not felt since long
before they had left.

00:02:19.942 --> 00:02:22.277 position:35% line:89% align:start
(shivering)

00:02:28.749 --> 00:02:30.918 position:38% line:89% align:start
(sneezes)

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:42.928 position:30% line:89% align:start
- I'm starving.

00:02:43.995 --> 00:02:45.997 position:30% line:89% align:start
(door crashes)

00:02:46.031 --> 00:02:48.632 position:30% line:89% align:start
(man screaming)

00:02:55.905 --> 00:02:58.675 position:10% line:89% align:start
- Pelje, you're coming home.

00:02:58.708 --> 00:03:00.409 position:21% line:89% align:start
- Chief, you're here!

00:03:04.947 --> 00:03:08.883 position:21% line:83% align:start
- You Borka robbers,
come with me too!

00:03:08.916 --> 00:03:09.851 position:38% line:89% align:start
- Really?

00:03:16.757 --> 00:03:19.358 position:30% line:89% align:start
(horse neighs)

00:03:27.733 --> 00:03:29.901 position:38% line:89% align:start
(screams)

00:03:36.807 --> 00:03:38.976 position:38% line:89% align:start
- Mommy.

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:54.956 position:19% line:89% align:start
(upbeat ambient music)

00:03:56.957 --> 00:03:59.426 position:35% line:89% align:start
(laughing)

00:04:16.975 --> 00:04:18.543 position:16% line:83% align:start
- You know, Lill-Klippen
didn't think

00:04:18.576 --> 00:04:22.847 position:16% line:83% align:start
that Pelje would survive
in the sheriff's prison.

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:25.482 position:10% line:89% align:start
He was so shocked to see him.

00:04:25.515 --> 00:04:30.086 position:7% line:83% align:start
He wasn't sure if it was really
him or his ghost. (laughs)

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:33.823 position:16% line:83% align:start
Mind you, it doesn't take
much to scare Lill-Klippen.

00:04:37.892 --> 00:04:41.129 position:24% line:83% align:start
- On our side, you
should have seen Borka.

00:04:41.162 --> 00:04:43.064 position:24% line:83% align:start
He couldn't believe
that Mattis had rescued

00:04:43.097 --> 00:04:47.134 position:21% line:83% align:start
two Borka robbers as
well as his own man.

00:04:47.167 --> 00:04:50.603 position:7% line:83% align:start
- And now, 'cause Mattis helped
them all escape the dungeon,

00:04:50.636 --> 00:04:51.971 position:19% line:89% align:start
the sheriff's even more

00:04:52.005 --> 00:04:53.806 position:30% line:83% align:start
determined than
ever to catch him.

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:56.408 position:7% line:89% align:start
He's got every soldier looking.

00:05:12.822 --> 00:05:14.891 position:19% line:83% align:start
Remember the other day,
back at the bear's cave,

00:05:14.924 --> 00:05:16.125 position:21% line:89% align:start
when it was raining?

00:05:16.159 --> 00:05:20.662 position:13% line:83% align:start
It felt like the woods were
really scary and frightening.

00:05:20.696 --> 00:05:22.731 position:27% line:89% align:start
But not anymore.

00:05:23.999 --> 00:05:27.102 position:21% line:83% align:start
Now the forest gives
me nothing but joy.

00:05:30.037 --> 00:05:32.772 position:7% line:89% align:start
And that's because I know that

00:05:32.806 --> 00:05:36.910 position:7% line:83% align:start
I'm going to be warm right down
to my toes when I come home.

00:05:40.579 --> 00:05:46.051 position:13% line:83% align:start
If I had to sleep shivering
in a cold cave every night,

00:05:46.085 --> 00:05:49.420 position:7% line:89% align:start
I might not feel the same way.

00:05:49.454 --> 00:05:51.588 position:24% line:89% align:start
- Yes, that's true.

00:05:51.622 --> 00:05:54.558 position:21% line:83% align:start
Now, when I get home
from the forest,

00:05:54.591 --> 00:05:57.460 position:21% line:83% align:start
I go straight to the
fire at Borka's Keep

00:05:57.493 --> 00:05:59.963 position:27% line:83% align:start
and curl up like
a little rabbit.

00:06:02.031 --> 00:06:03.399 position:30% line:89% align:start
You know what?

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:08.837 position:30% line:83% align:start
Undis and Borka
were actually glad

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:11.106 position:7% line:89% align:start
when I came back home to them.

00:06:12.974 --> 00:06:17.144 position:16% line:83% align:start
I wouldn't have believed
they cared so much about me.

00:06:18.812 --> 00:06:21.514 position:13% line:89% align:start
It is nice to be back home.

00:06:21.547 --> 00:06:23.016 position:41% line:89% align:start
- Yes.

00:06:23.049 --> 00:06:27.186 position:16% line:83% align:start
You should live with your
family as long as you like.

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:29.488 position:19% line:89% align:start
Well, until the spring.

00:06:29.521 --> 00:06:31.723 position:35% line:89% align:start
(laughing)

00:06:41.631 --> 00:06:42.465 position:41% line:89% align:start
Pelje!

00:06:44.167 --> 00:06:45.936 position:21% line:89% align:start
- [Pelje] Hey, Ronja!

00:06:52.274 --> 00:06:53.474 position:33% line:89% align:start
- Of course.

00:06:55.710 --> 00:06:58.046 position:24% line:89% align:start
It's a fine thing.

00:06:58.079 --> 00:07:02.516 position:21% line:83% align:start
That little snake can
come and go as he pleases.

00:07:02.549 --> 00:07:06.620 position:21% line:83% align:start
I invited him to come
home with us, after all.

00:07:06.653 --> 00:07:09.789 position:19% line:89% align:start
But, it's a relief now,

00:07:09.822 --> 00:07:11.991 position:10% line:89% align:start
not to have to stare at that,

00:07:13.159 --> 00:07:16.228 position:21% line:83% align:start
that little red head
of his all the time.

00:07:25.102 --> 00:07:25.936 position:41% line:89% align:start
- Joen.

00:07:28.538 --> 00:07:29.173 position:44% line:89% align:start
Here.

00:07:33.242 --> 00:07:35.477 position:35% line:89% align:start
(laughing)

00:07:43.617 --> 00:07:45.253 position:21% line:89% align:start
- Welcome back Pelje!

00:07:45.287 --> 00:07:47.221 position:16% line:89% align:start
No one stops my robbers.

00:07:48.155 --> 00:07:48.990 position:38% line:89% align:start
- Right!

00:07:50.057 --> 00:07:50.890 position:38% line:89% align:start
- To us!

00:07:52.826 --> 00:07:55.661 position:24% line:83% align:start
- We are the finest
robbers in the forest.

00:07:55.694 --> 00:07:58.231 position:7% line:89% align:start
- That's right, we're the best!

00:07:59.299 --> 00:08:01.532 position:27% line:83% align:start
- I rescued Pelje
from the dungeon

00:08:01.566 --> 00:08:05.003 position:5% line:89% align:start
and taught the sheriff a lesson.

00:08:05.036 --> 00:08:07.605 position:16% line:89% align:start
- What was it? (hiccups)

00:08:07.638 --> 00:08:11.742 position:13% line:83% align:start
- If you steal my robbers,
I'll steal 'em back. (laughs)

00:08:18.248 --> 00:08:22.018 position:27% line:83% align:start
- [Robber] No one
can beat our chief!

00:08:22.051 --> 00:08:24.253 position:16% line:83% align:start
- [Robber] The sheriff's
no match for Mattis!

00:08:24.286 --> 00:08:26.755 position:19% line:83% align:start
- [Robber] We'll follow
our chief anywhere!

00:08:26.788 --> 00:08:29.958 position:27% line:83% align:start
- [Robber] Mattis
you're the best!

00:08:29.991 --> 00:08:35.162 position:7% line:83% align:start
- [Noddle-Pete] And that's why
we've got soldiers everywhere.

00:08:35.195 --> 00:08:38.564 position:21% line:83% align:start
Swarming through the
woods like flies.

00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:44.903 position:16% line:83% align:start
And you know, the sheriff
will win in the end.

00:08:44.937 --> 00:08:46.239 position:27% line:89% align:start
I'm telling you.

00:08:46.272 --> 00:08:49.307 position:19% line:83% align:start
This is not a fight you
can win by yourself.

00:08:49.341 --> 00:08:53.178 position:7% line:89% align:start
But if you and Borka reconcile,

00:08:53.211 --> 00:08:56.579 position:24% line:83% align:start
and create a single
strong band of robbers,

00:08:58.249 --> 00:09:01.785 position:19% line:83% align:start
well you might just be
able to handle the sheriff,

00:09:01.818 --> 00:09:03.086 position:27% line:89% align:start
and all his men.

00:09:05.055 --> 00:09:07.257 position:21% line:83% align:start
Now if you and Borka
keep fighting each other

00:09:07.290 --> 00:09:08.724 position:24% line:89% align:start
over the treasure,

00:09:13.828 --> 00:09:18.199 position:21% line:83% align:start
like wolves fighting
over morsels of flesh,

00:09:18.232 --> 00:09:20.301 position:30% line:83% align:start
you can forget
beating the sheriff.

00:09:20.334 --> 00:09:21.701 position:27% line:89% align:start
You're dead meat.

00:09:24.971 --> 00:09:28.107 position:21% line:83% align:start
- Well you certainly
like to speak your mind,

00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:29.575 position:24% line:89% align:start
don't you old man?

00:09:30.943 --> 00:09:33.711 position:30% line:83% align:start
Of course, in a
way you're right.

00:09:35.314 --> 00:09:36.014 position:38% line:89% align:start
Tell me.

00:09:37.382 --> 00:09:40.818 position:16% line:83% align:start
Who would be the chief of
this great new robber clan?

00:09:40.851 --> 00:09:42.619 position:19% line:89% align:start
Did you think of that?

00:09:49.393 --> 00:09:50.693 position:35% line:89% align:start
Borka, eh?

00:09:51.961 --> 00:09:56.298 position:21% line:83% align:start
Listen, I, Mattis, am
the strongest, mightiest,

00:09:56.331 --> 00:10:01.702 position:10% line:83% align:start
toughest robber chieftain in
all the mountains and forests!

00:10:01.735 --> 00:10:04.738 position:13% line:89% align:start
And I intend to remain so!

00:10:04.772 --> 00:10:08.708 position:13% line:83% align:start
But we can't be sure Borka
will understand that.

00:10:10.009 --> 00:10:11.344 position:27% line:89% align:start
- Show him then.

00:10:11.377 --> 00:10:13.812 position:13% line:89% align:start
Show him who is in charge.

00:10:17.349 --> 00:10:19.351 position:13% line:89% align:start
You should be able to win.

00:10:19.384 --> 00:10:22.019 position:7% line:89% align:start
A duel with him would be easy.

00:10:22.053 --> 00:10:27.125 position:19% line:83% align:start
After all, you're built
like a great strong ox.

00:10:27.158 --> 00:10:30.127 position:27% line:83% align:start
And once you win,
you'll become chieftain

00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:35.664 position:16% line:83% align:start
of the single, big robber
band, and lead everyone!

00:10:35.698 --> 00:10:37.032 position:13% line:89% align:start
And then instead of hiding

00:10:37.066 --> 00:10:39.702 position:27% line:83% align:start
from the sheriff
and his soldiers,

00:10:39.735 --> 00:10:42.238 position:19% line:83% align:start
you'll be able to give
'em hell every day.

00:10:42.271 --> 00:10:44.172 position:30% line:89% align:start
How 'bout that?

00:10:44.205 --> 00:10:48.942 position:19% line:83% align:start
Soon they'll grow tired
of hunting us robbers, eh?

00:10:48.976 --> 00:10:51.945 position:27% line:83% align:start
- At last you're
talking some sense.

00:10:51.979 --> 00:10:53.080 position:35% line:89% align:start
(laughing)

00:10:53.113 --> 00:10:53.947 position:33% line:89% align:start
- I disagree!

00:10:55.315 --> 00:10:58.385 position:10% line:83% align:start
I think that the most cunning
and clever idea of all

00:10:58.418 --> 00:11:00.920 position:16% line:89% align:start
would be to stop robbing.

00:11:00.953 --> 00:11:03.688 position:30% line:89% align:start
(robbers gasp)

00:11:08.393 --> 00:11:10.694 position:38% line:89% align:start
(laughs)

00:11:12.096 --> 00:11:14.932 position:7% line:89% align:start
- What, don't look so shocked.

00:11:14.965 --> 00:11:16.833 position:19% line:89% align:start
I've always thought so.

00:11:27.476 --> 00:11:30.145 position:30% line:89% align:start
(mixed chatter)

00:11:38.952 --> 00:11:42.389 position:24% line:83% align:start
- Maybe your little
Ronja has got a point.

00:11:42.422 --> 00:11:45.791 position:10% line:89% align:start
Maybe we should stop robbing.

00:11:45.824 --> 00:11:48.928 position:16% line:89% align:start
But I'm too old, feeble,

00:11:48.961 --> 00:11:51.763 position:27% line:83% align:start
to drum that into
your thick head.

00:11:53.432 --> 00:11:54.265 position:27% line:89% align:start
- How dare you?!

00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:58.436 position:13% line:83% align:start
You, who have been a robber
since my father's day.

00:11:58.469 --> 00:12:00.404 position:16% line:89% align:start
How could you say that?!

00:12:01.872 --> 00:12:04.374 position:13% line:89% align:start
Stop robbing, are you mad?!

00:12:04.408 --> 00:12:07.477 position:24% line:83% align:start
What would we live
on then, nuts?

00:12:07.511 --> 00:12:09.278 position:19% line:89% align:start
- Have you ever noticed

00:12:09.312 --> 00:12:12.814 position:16% line:83% align:start
there are people in this
world who may not be robbers,

00:12:12.847 --> 00:12:16.784 position:24% line:83% align:start
and yet they still
manage to live very well.

00:12:16.818 --> 00:12:19.487 position:21% line:83% align:start
They somehow provide
for their families

00:12:19.521 --> 00:12:22.823 position:24% line:83% align:start
without the sheriff
hunting them all the time.

00:12:22.856 --> 00:12:23.424 position:38% line:89% align:start
- Maybe.

00:12:24.791 --> 00:12:27.160 position:27% line:83% align:start
But I don't know
how they do that.

00:12:28.795 --> 00:12:31.497 position:13% line:83% align:start
- There are many ways a man
could make an honest living.

00:12:31.531 --> 00:12:33.399 position:19% line:89% align:start
Some I could teach you.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.302 position:35% line:89% align:start
But, oh no.

00:12:37.336 --> 00:12:39.971 position:27% line:83% align:start
You'll never quit
the robber's life.

00:12:40.004 --> 00:12:45.543 position:10% line:83% align:start
Not until the sheriff catches
you and we're all strung up.

00:12:45.576 --> 00:12:48.912 position:24% line:83% align:start
Which is something
I'd rather avoid.

00:12:48.945 --> 00:12:50.814 position:16% line:89% align:start
That's why at some point,

00:12:50.847 --> 00:12:53.782 position:7% line:89% align:start
I'm gonna tell Ronja something.

00:12:53.816 --> 00:12:57.453 position:21% line:89% align:start
A nice little secret.

00:12:58.354 --> 00:12:59.821 position:38% line:89% align:start
- Secret?

00:13:00.489 --> 00:13:04.058 position:13% line:89% align:start
- (chuckles) That's right.

00:13:05.526 --> 00:13:07.495 position:30% line:89% align:start
I'll tell Ronja

00:13:07.528 --> 00:13:12.499 position:10% line:83% align:start
so she won't be left helpless
after you're locked up.

00:13:12.532 --> 00:13:15.369 position:10% line:89% align:start
- That's not going to happen!

00:13:15.402 --> 00:13:17.303 position:33% line:89% align:start
Now be quiet!

00:13:17.336 --> 00:13:18.803 position:7% line:89% align:start
- [Noddle-Pete] Yeah yeah yeah,

00:13:18.837 --> 00:13:22.807 position:21% line:83% align:start
be quiet, go to bed,
just 'cause I'm right.

00:13:22.841 --> 00:13:26.177 position:16% line:89% align:start
(exciting ambient music)

00:13:44.026 --> 00:13:47.496 position:5% line:89% align:start
- [Narrator] Several days later.

00:13:47.529 --> 00:13:49.196 position:38% line:89% align:start
- Mattis!

00:13:51.265 --> 00:13:52.800 position:27% line:89% align:start
This is serious!

00:14:04.476 --> 00:14:06.912 position:30% line:89% align:start
(horse neighs)

00:14:06.945 --> 00:14:10.214 position:19% line:83% align:start
- Where do you get the
nerve, summoning me?

00:14:10.248 --> 00:14:13.017 position:7% line:89% align:start
- I have some bad news, Mattis.

00:14:13.051 --> 00:14:14.619 position:19% line:89% align:start
If you value your life,

00:14:14.652 --> 00:14:18.188 position:21% line:83% align:start
do not poke your nose
into the woods today.

00:14:20.490 --> 00:14:23.893 position:10% line:89% align:start
Soldiers have set an ambush.

00:14:23.926 --> 00:14:26.829 position:24% line:83% align:start
They shot one of my
men with an arrow.

00:14:29.198 --> 00:14:33.501 position:7% line:83% align:start
- Wait, what's gotten into you
that you would tell me that?

00:14:33.535 --> 00:14:36.638 position:7% line:89% align:start
You think I'm some kinda fool?

00:14:36.671 --> 00:14:40.040 position:30% line:83% align:start
- Well you did
rescue two of my men.

00:14:40.074 --> 00:14:43.410 position:24% line:83% align:start
So I'm rendering a
service in return.

00:14:43.444 --> 00:14:45.378 position:16% line:89% align:start
You could say I owe you.

00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:49.582 position:38% line:89% align:start
(laughs)

00:14:52.552 --> 00:14:53.852 position:33% line:89% align:start
- Well Borka.

00:14:56.121 --> 00:14:58.457 position:19% line:83% align:start
It seems we'll have to
teach the sheriff's soldiers

00:14:58.490 --> 00:15:00.858 position:13% line:89% align:start
to mind their manners, huh?

00:15:01.992 --> 00:15:04.060 position:16% line:89% align:start
Once we get our hands on.

00:15:06.463 --> 00:15:07.497 position:47% line:89% align:start
We?

00:15:16.004 --> 00:15:19.641 position:24% line:89% align:start
(mischievous music)

00:15:19.675 --> 00:15:21.576 position:30% line:89% align:start
- [Borka] What?

00:15:21.609 --> 00:15:23.611 position:13% line:89% align:start
You're acting very strange.

00:15:25.613 --> 00:15:30.550 position:13% line:89% align:start
- Perhaps we should, maybe,

00:15:30.584 --> 00:15:33.219 position:10% line:89% align:start
join forces once and for all?

00:15:36.288 --> 00:15:41.025 position:13% line:83% align:start
- For once in your life you
said something quite clever.

00:15:41.059 --> 00:15:44.162 position:13% line:89% align:start
One strong band of robbers.

00:15:44.195 --> 00:15:47.297 position:21% line:89% align:start
That works! (laughs)

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:57.707 position:13% line:83% align:start
One united band of robbers
under one strong chief.

00:15:57.740 --> 00:16:01.376 position:24% line:83% align:start
Mattis, I know the
perfect man for the job.

00:16:01.410 --> 00:16:04.579 position:30% line:89% align:start
And that is me!

00:16:05.380 --> 00:16:07.482 position:38% line:89% align:start
(laughs)

00:16:08.650 --> 00:16:13.086 position:21% line:83% align:start
- I think you'll find
the perfect chief

00:16:13.119 --> 00:16:13.953 position:41% line:89% align:start
- Yes?

00:16:13.987 --> 00:16:16.923 position:24% line:89% align:start
would be this man!

00:16:18.625 --> 00:16:21.494 position:30% line:89% align:start
(rooster crows)

00:16:23.028 --> 00:16:25.697 position:30% line:89% align:start
(mixed arguing)

00:16:28.767 --> 00:16:29.600 position:41% line:89% align:start
- Out!

00:16:41.445 --> 00:16:45.347 position:16% line:83% align:start
And don't come back until
I've called you back!

00:16:58.091 --> 00:16:59.760 position:27% line:83% align:start
- I don't want to
watch them fighting

00:16:59.793 --> 00:17:01.595 position:16% line:89% align:start
or battering each other.

00:17:02.796 --> 00:17:06.399 position:24% line:83% align:start
- Don't worry, they
won't allow you there.

00:17:06.432 --> 00:17:11.736 position:10% line:83% align:start
Women and children must keep
away from wild beast matches.

00:17:11.770 --> 00:17:15.307 position:7% line:89% align:start
The old custom must be obeyed.

00:17:16.775 --> 00:17:20.444 position:21% line:83% align:start
- Wild beast matches,
that's perfect.

00:17:20.478 --> 00:17:22.480 position:5% line:89% align:start
You should've been here earlier.

00:17:22.513 --> 00:17:24.547 position:24% line:83% align:start
It was a wild beast
stand alright,

00:17:24.581 --> 00:17:27.617 position:7% line:89% align:start
the men shouting and screaming.

00:17:27.650 --> 00:17:30.185 position:21% line:83% align:start
- Well I can tell you
it's been the same for us,

00:17:30.219 --> 00:17:32.654 position:27% line:89% align:start
in Borka's Keep.

00:17:32.688 --> 00:17:34.189 position:30% line:83% align:start
Undis has been
shouting at the men

00:17:34.223 --> 00:17:38.326 position:27% line:83% align:start
all day to drive
them out. (giggling)

00:17:44.397 --> 00:17:46.633 position:35% line:89% align:start
(grunting)

00:17:50.837 --> 00:17:53.439 position:10% line:89% align:start
- Borka had better watch out.

00:17:53.472 --> 00:17:56.509 position:21% line:83% align:start
Undis won't recognize
him after this!

00:17:58.510 --> 00:18:03.781 position:7% line:83% align:start
- Always save the bragging for
when you're riding back home.

00:18:03.815 --> 00:18:06.683 position:21% line:83% align:start
That's what my mother
used to say to me.

00:18:08.252 --> 00:18:09.786 position:24% line:89% align:start
- But Noddle-Pete,

00:18:09.820 --> 00:18:13.789 position:24% line:83% align:start
you're going to be
at the match, right?

00:18:15.458 --> 00:18:20.495 position:13% line:83% align:start
I know you've been feeling
unwell, but a wild beast match!

00:18:22.464 --> 00:18:24.633 position:13% line:89% align:start
That will stir your heart.

00:18:28.669 --> 00:18:30.704 position:27% line:89% align:start
Come on, old man.

00:18:30.738 --> 00:18:32.505 position:16% line:89% align:start
You can ride on my horse.

00:18:33.640 --> 00:18:36.743 position:30% line:83% align:start
Let's go to the
fight of the century.

00:18:55.692 --> 00:18:58.828 position:19% line:89% align:start
(horse hooves clopping)

00:19:03.699 --> 00:19:05.568 position:35% line:89% align:start
Woah, woah.

00:19:17.878 --> 00:19:19.846 position:21% line:89% align:start
Well then, here goes.

00:19:28.620 --> 00:19:31.356 position:27% line:89% align:start
(exciting music)

00:19:47.269 --> 00:19:48.705 position:41% line:89% align:start
Borka!

00:19:48.738 --> 00:19:51.440 position:24% line:83% align:start
I thought you'd run
away like a baby.

00:19:51.473 --> 00:19:52.574 position:30% line:89% align:start
Are you ready?

00:19:54.810 --> 00:19:56.611 position:7% line:89% align:start
- I'm actually quite surprised

00:19:56.644 --> 00:19:58.913 position:5% line:89% align:start
to see you turn up here, Mattis.

00:19:58.946 --> 00:20:00.815 position:30% line:89% align:start
I was worried.

00:20:00.848 --> 00:20:02.883 position:19% line:83% align:start
Thought you might lock
yourself up in your fort,

00:20:02.917 --> 00:20:04.718 position:19% line:89% align:start
too scared to come out.

00:20:06.219 --> 00:20:08.387 position:16% line:83% align:start
Back when you were a boy,
whenever you were upset

00:20:08.420 --> 00:20:11.290 position:10% line:89% align:start
or things didn't go your way,

00:20:11.323 --> 00:20:16.561 position:10% line:83% align:start
you used to shut yourself in
your room and sulk like a baby.

00:20:16.594 --> 00:20:18.196 position:35% line:89% align:start
- Shut up!

00:20:18.229 --> 00:20:19.530 position:13% line:89% align:start
Why don't you stop talking

00:20:19.564 --> 00:20:23.600 position:21% line:83% align:start
and prepare yourself
for a beating!

00:20:28.270 --> 00:20:30.706 position:30% line:89% align:start
(clears throat)

00:20:30.740 --> 00:20:35.377 position:13% line:83% align:start
- And now, under the rules
passed through the generations,

00:20:35.410 --> 00:20:37.445 position:16% line:89% align:start
we shall begin the match.

00:20:39.214 --> 00:20:41.950 position:19% line:83% align:start
In a wild beast match,
every kind of attack

00:20:41.983 --> 00:20:46.320 position:13% line:89% align:start
and dirty hold is allowed.

00:20:46.353 --> 00:20:51.457 position:27% line:83% align:start
You may break and
bore, rip and tear,

00:20:51.491 --> 00:20:53.593 position:27% line:89% align:start
bite and scratch.

00:20:55.762 --> 00:20:57.930 position:13% line:89% align:start
- Throw him off the cliff!

00:20:57.964 --> 00:21:00.766 position:16% line:89% align:start
- Mattis, tear him apart!

00:21:01.767 --> 00:21:03.334 position:24% line:89% align:start
- Crush him, Borka!

00:21:07.672 --> 00:21:08.839 position:35% line:89% align:start
- However.

00:21:10.808 --> 00:21:12.676 position:27% line:89% align:start
You may not kick

00:21:13.443 --> 00:21:14.744 position:27% line:89% align:start
between the legs.

00:21:15.545 --> 00:21:17.714 position:16% line:89% align:start
Now both sides approach.

00:21:23.485 --> 00:21:26.921 position:24% line:83% align:start
- If you wanna run,
now's your chance.

00:21:26.954 --> 00:21:31.258 position:10% line:83% align:start
- Oh I'm not going anywhere,
but you'll wish I had.

00:21:31.291 --> 00:21:33.827 position:24% line:83% align:start
Now, say goodbye to
all your men and horses

00:21:33.860 --> 00:21:36.295 position:21% line:89% align:start
before I take it all.

00:21:37.296 --> 00:21:38.597 position:21% line:89% align:start
And that's a promise.

00:21:39.665 --> 00:21:42.334 position:21% line:83% align:start
- Well it would only
be delight of me
