I am queen of all the

[MELTY]
Who doesn't?

210
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:35,483
Centuries ago, one of
the heroes of the time

211
00:12:35,567 --> 00:12:37,567
raised a filolial
called Fitoria.

[NAOFUMI]
"Centuries ago"?

213

So that means you must have

inherited the name
or something, right?

215
00:12:42,858 --> 00:12:46,442
No, the name Fitoria has
always belonged to me.

Do you think I'll ever
be as big as she is?

I hope so!

If you ever got
as big as she is,

[FILO groans]

If she were to grow to
be as large as I am,

222
00:12:56,858 --> 00:12:58,733
it would take her
dozens of times longer

223
00:12:58,817 --> 00:13:01,067
than the lifespan
of a normal filolial.

Aww!

Yes.

capital after a diplomatic trip.

245

[NAOFUMI] I see. So that's
something you do often?

246
00:13:46,108 --> 00:13:47,608
Anyway, not that I'm ungrateful

247

but what do you want with us?

will take time

256
00:14:08,858 --> 00:14:11,983
It's good fodder for the
development of my shield.

Please don't.

258
00:14:13,192 --> 00:14:15,358
I sense an ominous
aura in your shield.

[NAOFUMI gasps]

of using them are dire.

I appreciate the concern,

but I need dragon material and
the Rage Shield to survive.

Fine. Do what you must.

released from its seal.

325
00:17:32,358 --> 00:17:35,817
I thought you showed up to
save us because you knew.

326
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:37,525
[FITORIA] I was there
because I was told that

327
00:17:37,608 --> 00:17:41,233
a new candidate for the
next queen had been found.

328
00:17:41,317 --> 00:17:43,192
[NAOFUMI]
Candidate for queen...

329
00:17:43,275 --> 00:17:44,858
You mean Filo?

330
00:17:44,942 --> 00:17:45,942
[FITORIA]
Yes.

331
00:17:46,025 --> 00:17:47,817
[NAOFUMI]
Can I ask you something?

332
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,192
[FITORIA]
Go ahead.

333
00:17:49,275 --> 00:17:51,483
Why is it that Filo's
growing so much differently

334
00:17:51,567 --> 00:17:54,900
and so much bigger than
almost any other filolial?

335
00:17:54,983 --> 00:17:56,567
[FITORIA]
She's like me.

336
00:17:58,692 --> 00:18:00,733
[FITORIA]
A hero is raising her.

337
00:18:00,817 --> 00:18:02,858
[NAOFUMI gasps]

338
00:18:02,942 --> 00:18:04,067
[FITORIA]
Now tell me.

339
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:07,067
Why was that monster
released from its seal?

340
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:12,358
[MELTY, FILO snoring]

341
00:18:14,275 --> 00:18:15,567
[sighs]

342
00:18:15,650 --> 00:18:17,317
What's wrong with you?

343
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,900
I am appalled.

344
00:18:18,983 --> 00:18:21,067
You Cardinal Heroes
should all be ashamed,

345
00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:24,317
squabbling with each other when
the next Wave is approaching.

346
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,775
Gimme a break. They started it!

347
00:18:26,858 --> 00:18:28,858
[FITORIA] The Shield Hero
has always been shunned

348
00:18:28,942 --> 00:18:31,442
by the human
supremacist countries.

349
00:18:31,525 --> 00:18:33,317
Okay, then you
should understand.

350
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:35,608
That's the whole reason we're
trying to cross the border--

351
00:18:35,692 --> 00:18:38,150
[FITORIA]
Leaving won't solve anything.

352
00:18:38,233 --> 00:18:40,025
Work it out.

353
00:18:40,108 --> 00:18:42,733
The humans and demi-humans
may hate each other,

354
00:18:42,817 --> 00:18:45,567
but the heroes mustn't
fight amongst themselves.

355
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:53,275
[NAOFUMI groans]

356
00:18:54,775 --> 00:18:56,692
[FITORIA] Don't you know
about the hourglass?

357
00:18:56,775 --> 00:18:59,025
All four of you
certainly should.

358
00:18:59,108 --> 00:19:01,400
If you're talking about
the dragon hourglass,

359
00:19:01,483 --> 00:19:03,150
yeah, we all know about it.

360
00:19:03,233 --> 00:19:05,483
Then why aren't you fighting
the Waves of Catastrophe

361
00:19:05,567 --> 00:19:06,900
across the world?

362
00:19:06,983 --> 00:19:09,233
[NAOFUMI gasps]
Wait a second.

363
00:19:09,317 --> 00:19:11,108
Are you saying the
Waves of Catastrophe

364
00:19:11,192 --> 00:19:13,608
don't just happen
inside of Melromarc?

365
00:19:14,650 --> 00:19:16,192
No, they happen everywhere.

366
00:19:16,275 --> 00:19:18,983
The four heroes are meant
to go to one country each

367
00:19:19,067 --> 00:19:20,608
every time there's a Wave.

368
00:19:20,692 --> 00:19:23,775
But nobody ever
told me about that.

369
00:19:23,858 --> 00:19:25,858
[FITORIA] I've been traveling
the world in your stead,

370
00:19:25,942 --> 00:19:27,108
whenever I'm asked.

371
00:19:27,192 --> 00:19:29,817
But you four aren't
helping anywhere else.

372
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:31,817
[NAOFUMI] Hell, I just
found out other countries

373
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:34,025
had their own hourglasses.

374
00:19:34,108 --> 00:19:36,192
[FITORIA] Honestly,
what happens to the humans

375
00:19:36,275 --> 00:19:37,650
doesn't matter to me.

376
00:19:37,733 --> 00:19:39,983
I'm only fighting because
the hero who raised me

377
00:19:40,067 --> 00:19:41,817
asked me to do so.

378
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:44,400
[NAOFUMI]
He asked? Or told?

379
00:19:44,483 --> 00:19:46,108
[FITORIA]
My job is to protect the world

380
00:19:46,192 --> 00:19:48,192
and keep its people safe.

381
00:19:48,275 --> 00:19:49,733
[NAOFUMI]
She doesn't care about humans,

382
00:19:49,817 --> 00:19:51,650
but she wants to save them?

383
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:55,025
[FITORIA] But I can't
do that all by myself.

384
00:19:55,108 --> 00:19:57,400
I need the heroes to help me.

385
00:19:57,483 --> 00:19:59,317
[NAOFUMI] Honestly,
you seem a lot more capable

386
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,692
than any of us.

387
00:20:00,775 --> 00:20:02,942
[FITORIA]
That may be true for now,

388
00:20:03,025 --> 00:20:04,817
but eventually...

389
00:20:06,442 --> 00:20:08,108
[FITORIA]
...I won't be enough.

390
00:20:10,192 --> 00:20:13,275
[NAOFUMI] So that's why you
need the heroes to help you.

391
00:20:13,358 --> 00:20:14,900
[FITORIA]
Exactly.

392
00:20:24,567 --> 00:20:26,150
[REN]
Is this the place?

393
00:20:26,233 --> 00:20:27,858
Yeah, I think so.

394
00:20:37,608 --> 00:20:38,983
[ITSUKI gasps]

395
00:20:39,067 --> 00:20:40,483
No question.

396
00:20:40,567 --> 00:20:43,067
The Three Heroes Church is
definitely hiding something.

397
00:20:43,150 --> 00:20:44,650
[REN exhales]

398
00:20:44,733 --> 00:20:47,150
[REN] Hard to believe
Naofumi was right.

399
00:20:55,817 --> 00:20:57,942
[ITSUKI]
It's some kind of archive.

400
00:20:59,483 --> 00:21:01,108
Let's take a look around.

401
00:21:07,150 --> 00:21:09,233
Mind your own business.

402
00:21:10,858 --> 00:21:13,442
[NAOFUMI] You want me to
make up with those guys?

403
00:21:13,525 --> 00:21:16,483
[FITORIA] The Cardinal Heroes
are supposed to work together.

404
00:21:16,567 --> 00:21:20,275
That is absolutely crucial
to this world's protection.

405
00:21:20,358 --> 00:21:21,608
Not happening.

406
00:21:21,692 --> 00:21:23,983
The whole country,
besides those three,

407
00:21:24,067 --> 00:21:25,525
wants to get rid of me.

408
00:21:25,608 --> 00:21:27,775
Don't worry, I'm aware
of what's happening.

409
00:21:27,858 --> 00:21:30,692
Regardless, the heroes must
stop fighting each other.

410
00:21:30,775 --> 00:21:33,150
You're kinda
obsessing about that.

411
00:21:33,233 --> 00:21:35,858
[FITORIA] Because it is
completely unacceptable.

412
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:38,150
Well it's a lost cause,

413
00:21:38,233 --> 00:21:41,317
'cause they don't wanna
play nice with me either.

414
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,483
[FITORIA]
Are you certain?

415
00:21:43,567 --> 00:21:44,733
[NAOFUMI]
Yeah.

416
00:21:45,775 --> 00:21:46,775
I see.

417
00:21:46,858 --> 00:21:48,733
You've made up your mind then.

418
00:21:50,983 --> 00:21:54,108
[FITORIA] It's been a while,
several lifetimes, in fact.

419
00:21:54,192 --> 00:21:56,442
I can hardly remember anything.

420
00:21:56,525 --> 00:21:59,775
But I do still remember what
this means I'll have to do.

421
00:22:01,108 --> 00:22:04,067
[FITORIA] If the heroes
are fighting each other

422
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:07,192
instead of fighting the
Waves of Catastrophe...

423
00:22:11,733 --> 00:22:13,858
...then you leave me no choice.

424
00:22:13,942 --> 00:22:16,025
I must kill all four of you.
