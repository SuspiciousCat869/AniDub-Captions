the upgrade that I wanted.

[FILO whines]

37
00:03:56,525 --> 00:03:58,025
[MIRELIA] I have been
told that it's possible

38
00:03:58,108 --> 00:04:01,483
for certain items to affect
the class upgrade process.

39
00:04:01,567 --> 00:04:03,983
Perhaps that's what
happened to you.

40

[NAOFUMI] I wonder if the
cowlick Fitoria gave her

41
00:04:06,358 --> 00:04:07,775
is the problem.

[MELTY] I wish you could've
been there to see her, Mother.

everything about her!

[MELTY]
Well, in her bird form,

51
00:04:24,858 --> 00:04:27,275
Fitoria was as big as the
monster we were fighting,

52
00:04:27,358 --> 00:04:29,942
and some of her feathers
were the color of the sky!

53

[MIRELIA]
Anything else?

54
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:32,817
[MELTY]
She had feathers on her head

55
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:34,483
that were kind of like a crown.

56
00:04:34,567 --> 00:04:36,525
And she let me
ride on top of her!

57
00:04:36,608 --> 00:04:38,567
It was a dream come true!

[NAOFUMI] So why'd you
call us back here so soon?

Is something wrong?

67
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:02,192
Oh, no, I'm planning on
throwing a party tonight,

68
00:05:02,275 --> 00:05:05,733
and I want all four of the
Cardinal Heroes in attendance.

69
00:05:05,817 --> 00:05:08,400
I need advance notice
for that kind of thing.

70
00:05:08,483 --> 00:05:09,983
[MIRELIA] If I'd told
you that was the reason,

71
00:05:10,067 --> 00:05:12,150
you never would've come.

In truth, though,

73
00:05:14,108 --> 00:05:16,983
the party's just an excuse
to get you all here.

74

There's something
you need to know.

Something all four of the
heroes would benefit from.

It is of the utmost importance.

170

[MIRELIA] Sir Motoyasu,
you forged a slave pact

171
00:09:32,983 --> 00:09:34,483
with her as well.

172
00:09:34,567 --> 00:09:37,817
Why don't you confirm it for
yourself next time you see her?

173
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:38,942
[MOTOYASU groans]

174
00:09:39,025 --> 00:09:41,817
Forget it. Can we
please just move on?

175
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:43,567
[MIRELIA] While my
daughter's foolishness

176
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:46,400
has clearly played
a significant part,

177
00:09:46,483 --> 00:09:49,900
I believe the real reason you
heroes haven't leveled up faster

178
00:09:49,983 --> 00:09:51,983
is the animosity between you.

179
00:09:52,067 --> 00:09:53,358
Therefore, I believe it would be

180
00:09:53,442 --> 00:09:55,358
prudent for you
to clear the air.

181
00:09:55,442 --> 00:09:58,025
If you can all share what
you've learned with each other,

182
00:09:58,108 --> 00:10:01,275
your trip to Cal Mira
will be much more efficient.

183
00:10:01,358 --> 00:10:03,150
That seems unnecessary.

184
00:10:03,233 --> 00:10:05,400
So what do you think
there is for us to share?

185
00:10:05,483 --> 00:10:07,150
I already know
what I need to know.

186
00:10:07,233 --> 00:10:09,192
We'd just be wasting time.

187
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:12,400
[NAOFUMI] Unbelievable. These
guys haven't learned anything.

188
00:10:12,483 --> 00:10:16,567
[MIRELIA sighs] It seems as
though you've misunderstood me.

189
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:19,317
Perhaps I should
put this bluntly.

190
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,900
If nothing changes drastically,

191
00:10:21,983 --> 00:10:24,900
Sir Naofumi may
survive the next Wave,

192
00:10:24,983 --> 00:10:27,067

[MIRELIA]
I'd have thought it was obvious.

196
00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:40,692
The three of you were
defeated during the last Wave.

197
00:10:40,775 --> 00:10:43,983
It's highly unlikely you'll
survive the next one.

198
00:10:45,317 --> 00:10:47,275
[MIRELIA]
The only way you can win

199
00:10:47,358 --> 00:10:50,483
is if all four heroes
rally together.

200
00:10:50,567 --> 00:10:51,608
Think of this conference

201
00:10:51,692 --> 00:10:54,358
as a way to cultivate
that solidarity.

everything I know...

228
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:09,233
...on one condition.

229
00:12:09,317 --> 00:12:12,733
You have to tell me
your secrets first.

230
00:12:12,817 --> 00:12:14,442
What do you think we should do?

231
00:12:14,525 --> 00:12:16,650
We don't have much
of a choice, do we?

232
00:12:16,733 --> 00:12:18,942
Okay, fine.

233

I'll keep it simple for ya!

234
00:12:21,317 --> 00:12:22,983
When you pick up the
same type of weapon

235
00:12:23,067 --> 00:12:25,400
as your legendary weapon,
you can make a copy

using the appropriately
named weapon copy system.

And it helped us when
we were starting out

is pick it up?

[NAOFUMI]
Just shut up and tell me how.

246

As long as you have the required
crafting skill and recipes,

247
00:12:46,358 --> 00:12:48,400
you can feed your
weapon the materials,

248
00:12:48,483 --> 00:12:51,275
and it'll automatically
craft items for you.

also a teleport skill.

You can instantly travel to
any location you've been before.

Don't tell me.

that one either?

made life a lot easier.

[ITSUKI] Now for something
I'm sure you don't know:

257

the secret to getting
stronger as fast as possible.

Being the best in this world

259
00:13:18,358 --> 00:13:21,067
all depends on how
rare your weapon is.

260
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:23,608
So if you focus on developing
weapons that are rare...

[REN]
Don't lie to him.

262
00:13:25,483 --> 00:13:27,400
The key is weapon proficiency.

No, you're all wrong!

264
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,442
Refining your weapon
and boosting its stats

265
00:13:31,525 --> 00:13:32,567
is what's important.

266

Are you crazy?

00:15:47,275 --> 00:15:48,692
Guess I'll do it later.

319
00:15:48,775 --> 00:15:49,983
The ship you're taking

320
00:15:50,067 --> 00:15:52,567
is docked in a harbor
that is far from here.

321
00:15:52,650 --> 00:15:55,525
You should be on your way
as well, Sir Naofumi.

322
00:15:55,608 --> 00:15:57,858
Right. We should get
going then, don't ya think?

323
00:15:57,942 --> 00:15:58,942
--'Kay.
--Yeah.

324
00:15:59,025 --> 00:16:00,192
[MIRELIA]
I wish you luck.

325
00:16:00,275 --> 00:16:01,233
Thank you.

326
00:16:02,608 --> 00:16:03,358
Naofumi.

327
00:16:03,442 --> 00:16:04,317
[NAOFUMI]
Mm?

328
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:08,400
You better work hard out there

329
00:16:08,483 --> 00:16:10,733
so you can level up
a whole bunch.

330
00:16:16,858 --> 00:16:20,233
And here I was thinking
that you would go with them.

331
00:16:20,317 --> 00:16:21,275
No.

332
00:16:21,358 --> 00:16:22,733
Not my place.

333
00:16:22,817 --> 00:16:25,358
Besides, I have
my own job to do.

334
00:16:31,275 --> 00:16:32,858
Hey, kid.

335
00:16:32,942 --> 00:16:34,525
How about that trial, huh?

336
00:16:34,608 --> 00:16:36,192
I betcha feel great!

337
00:16:39,317 --> 00:16:41,358
Uh... what are ya doin' there?

338
00:16:50,858 --> 00:16:52,525
It worked!

339
00:16:52,608 --> 00:16:54,608
What the-- "It worked," my ass!

340
00:16:54,692 --> 00:16:55,775
You keep that up and you'll

341
00:16:55,858 --> 00:16:57,775
completely run me
out of business!

342
00:16:57,858 --> 00:16:59,317
How in the world
did you do that?

343
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,692
[FILO]
That's amazing!

344
00:17:00,775 --> 00:17:03,525
That is not amazing,
it's called forgery or theft!

345
00:17:03,608 --> 00:17:05,692
I'm sorry, but I have to.

346
00:17:05,775 --> 00:17:06,942
[ERHARDT]
Wait, stop!

347
00:17:07,025 --> 00:17:08,817
That one's expensive!

348
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:11,025
[ERHARDT gasps]
That one's really rare!

349
00:17:11,108 --> 00:17:13,192
--[FILO giggles]
--Hey, hey, you put that down!

350
00:17:13,275 --> 00:17:14,692
--[ERHARDT gasping]
--[RAPHTALIA] Try this!

351
00:17:14,775 --> 00:17:16,150
--[ERHARDT gasping]
--[FILO] I got one, too!

352
00:17:16,233 --> 00:17:19,483
[ERHARDT]
Fine! Do whatever you want!

353
00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:25,567
Are ya happy now?

354
00:17:25,650 --> 00:17:26,733
Uh-huh.

355
00:17:26,817 --> 00:17:28,442
I promise I'll pay you back.

356
00:17:28,525 --> 00:17:29,983
Yeah, sure...

357
00:17:30,067 --> 00:17:31,525
I'll just put it
all on your tab.

358
00:17:31,608 --> 00:17:33,817
Now go make yourself
a killing in Cal Mira.

359
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:35,317
You got it.

360
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:50,817
[NAOFUMI] All righty,
that should cover everything.

361
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:52,692
--Master Naofumi?
--[NAOFUMI] Hm?

362
00:17:52,775 --> 00:17:55,692
Could we maybe take a
little bit of a detour?

363
00:18:10,817 --> 00:18:12,233
You're home.

364
00:18:12,317 --> 00:18:14,025
That's good, Rifana.

365
00:18:18,067 --> 00:18:22,442
[NAOFUMI] So... this is
Raphtalia's village.

366
00:18:22,525 --> 00:18:25,192
[NAOFUMI] Were you the
ones who buried her?

367
00:18:25,275 --> 00:18:26,483
[VAN]
Yes.

368
00:18:26,567 --> 00:18:29,650
Everyone in the
village contributed.

369
00:18:29,733 --> 00:18:30,858
[KEEL]
Hey, Raphtalia...

370
00:18:30,942 --> 00:18:32,358
[RAPHTALIA]
Mm?

371
00:18:32,442 --> 00:18:36,400
Let's make sure the village goes
back to how it used to be.

372
00:18:36,483 --> 00:18:37,692
Yeah.

373
00:18:39,025 --> 00:18:40,483
[VAN]
There must be more--

374
00:18:40,567 --> 00:18:44,942
Survivors just like these two,
scattered throughout the world.

375
00:18:45,025 --> 00:18:47,150
I'm sure there are many of them.

376
00:18:47,233 --> 00:18:49,442
I only wish I knew how to help.

377
00:18:55,192 --> 00:18:57,192
Is there something
I could do to help?

378
00:18:57,275 --> 00:18:58,442
Huh...

379
00:18:59,483 --> 00:19:00,317
[L'ARC]
Hey!

380
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,358
Uh--

381
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:05,650
[L'ARC] Do, uh...
Do you live around here?

382
00:19:05,733 --> 00:19:09,067
Nah, I'm honestly
just passing through.

383
00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:10,650
[L'ARC]
Gotcha.

384
00:19:10,733 --> 00:19:12,942
What a sad sight, huh?

385
00:19:13,025 --> 00:19:16,192
Whole place is
nothin' but rubble.

386
00:19:16,275 --> 00:19:19,692
Bet it's the same where
you're from, kiddo.

387
00:19:19,775 --> 00:19:22,317
Huh? Kiddo? You okay?

388
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:25,108
Hey, I'm not a "kiddo."
I'm actually 20.

389
00:19:25,192 --> 00:19:26,942
[L'ARC]
Oh, sorry 'bout that.

390
00:19:27,025 --> 00:19:28,650
That's kinda my
nickname for anybody

391
00:19:28,733 --> 00:19:30,358
who looks younger than me.

392
00:19:30,442 --> 00:19:32,025
Don't let it bug you.

393
00:19:32,108 --> 00:19:34,317
L'Arc, we should be moving on.

394
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,483
[L'ARC]
Yeah, let's go.

395
00:19:36,567 --> 00:19:37,983
We've got work to do.

396
00:19:38,067 --> 00:19:39,150
--[THERESE] Yes.
--[NAOFUMI] Hm?

397
00:19:39,233 --> 00:19:40,525
[L'ARC]
See ya!

398
00:19:52,192 --> 00:19:53,567
[NAOFUMI]
Ready to go?

399
00:19:55,983 --> 00:19:57,067
[RAPHTALIA]
Yeah.

400
00:19:57,150 --> 00:19:59,025
I think I am ready.

401
00:19:59,108 --> 00:20:02,400
I got to tell Mom, Dad,
and Rifana that I'm okay.

402
00:20:03,817 --> 00:20:05,192
[NAOFUMI]
That's great.

403
00:20:10,150 --> 00:20:11,608
What's wrong?

404
00:20:12,650 --> 00:20:14,733
[RAPHTALIA]
Master Naofumi...

405
00:20:14,817 --> 00:20:17,858
You won't... leave me, will you?

406
00:20:19,233 --> 00:20:20,733
[RAPHTALIA]
Because I can't even imagine

407
00:20:20,817 --> 00:20:22,942
living in a world
without you by my side.

408
00:20:23,025 --> 00:20:24,733
[FILO gasps]
Wait a second.

409
00:20:24,817 --> 00:20:27,400
Master, are you going somewhere?

410
00:20:29,525 --> 00:20:31,192
You don't need to worry.

411
00:20:31,275 --> 00:20:32,442
I'm staying right here.

412
00:20:32,525 --> 00:20:33,275
You promise?

413
00:20:33,358 --> 00:20:34,483
Of course.

414
00:20:34,567 --> 00:20:35,817
Because I don't wanna
leave this world

415
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:39,567
in the hands of the
Three Cardinal Stooges.

416
00:20:39,650 --> 00:20:41,442
Can we go now?

417
00:20:44,358 --> 00:20:46,400
Yes!

418
00:20:46,483 --> 00:20:49,900
[NAOFUMI] I can't leave until
these two find happiness here.

419
00:20:49,983 --> 00:20:51,067
Master Naofumi?

420
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:52,108
Are you okay?

421
00:20:52,192 --> 00:20:54,317
Yeah. I'm just fine.

422
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,275
[FILO]
Hey, Master, don't do that.

423
00:20:56,358 --> 00:20:57,817
Tell us what you were
thinking about!

424
00:20:57,900 --> 00:20:59,900
[NAOFUMI sighs]
Drop it. Let's go.

425
00:20:59,983 --> 00:21:02,525
Aww... Why won't you tell us?

426
00:21:02,608 --> 00:21:03,942
Filo, give it a rest.

427
00:21:04,025 --> 00:21:05,983
[FILO]
At least I'm not a nag like you!

428
00:21:06,067 --> 00:21:08,650
[gasps] When have I
ever "nagged" anyone?!

429
00:21:08,733 --> 00:21:10,983
[FILO] Gee, I don't know,
let's think...

430
00:21:11,067 --> 00:21:13,525
[RAPHTALIA]
Ugh, Filo, quit messing around.

431
00:21:13,608 --> 00:21:14,567
You're bothering Master Naofumi.

432
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:16,150
[FILO]
Nuh-uh! I am not!

433
00:21:16,233 --> 00:21:17,650
[RAPHTALIA]
Uh-huh, you are, too!

434
00:21:17,733 --> 00:21:20,650
[FILO] I don't bother him
half as much as you do!

435
00:21:22,483 --> 00:21:24,567
[RAPHTALIA]
Is that the ship we're taking?

436
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:29,358
[ADVENTURERS chattering]

437
00:21:29,442 --> 00:21:32,108
Only so many ships
set sail in a day.

438
00:21:32,192 --> 00:21:34,108
Those morons, look at 'em!

439
00:21:34,192 --> 00:21:35,650
Can we go, Master Naofumi?

440
00:21:35,733 --> 00:21:37,067
Go ahead.

441
00:23:12,483 --> 00:23:14,900
[CAPTAIN 22A]
We're terribly sorry, sir!

442
00:23:14,983 --> 00:23:18,775
We thought we had a private
room prepared for you, but...

443
00:23:18,858 --> 00:23:21,650
...the other heroes got
here early and they...

444
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:24,067
...took over pretty
much every cabin.

445
00:23:24,150 --> 00:23:26,275
[NAOFUMI] Punishing us
for making them wait?

446
00:23:26,358 --> 00:23:28,650
[RAPHTALIA]
That doesn't bode well, does it?

447
00:23:30,775 --> 00:23:32,150
Sorry for the inconvenience,

448
00:23:32,233 --> 00:23:34,442
but you'll be sharing this
room with other passengers.

449
00:23:34,525 --> 00:23:35,483
[NAOFUMI]
Fine.

450
00:23:35,567 --> 00:23:36,483
[knocking]

451
00:23:36,567 --> 00:23:37,942
[L'ARC]
Come in.

452
00:23:39,483 --> 00:23:40,483
[gasps]

453
00:23:42,525 --> 00:23:43,900
Oh! Hey, kiddo!

454
00:23:43,983 --> 00:23:45,817
We meet again, huh?
