[RAPHTALIA]
Mm!

00:00:32,233 --> 00:00:34,233
[NAOFUMI] I'm the one who
agreed to take this job.

You don't have to force
yourself to keep up.

[RAPHTALIA]
No, I'll be fine.

Master Naofumi, don't forget

I'm the one who begged

We're almost finished, anyway.

[RAPHTALIA] Thank goodness
we managed to finish that job.

Aw, I wanted to fight
some more. I was having fun!

19
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:06,192
[NAOFUMI] We'll start heading
back to the capital tomorrow.

Huh? So you're wrapping up
the trading trip already?

[NAOFUMI] Yes, your
treatment takes priority.

22
00:01:11,608 --> 00:01:13,317
We have to get to
the capitol's church.

23
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:16,692
We need some pretty powerful
holy water to dispel that curse.

We still have a long way.
You have to take it easy.

I'm happy 'cause I made
such a wonderful friend today!

You mean that Mel girl
you met earlier?

[FILO] Mm-hm. She told
me she's traveled

to all sorts of amazing
places, just like me.

And then, she told me

about so much other
stuff I didn't know!

That so?

separated from the
rest of her people

while she was
playing with filolials.

Well, good for her...

146

Uh?

I apologize for
showing up so late.

Could you...

151
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,150
Um, would it be
a problem for me

to travel with you for
just a little while?

Wait a sec, you can't
travel with us.

the royal capital and, um...

beautiful filolials, I, uh...

00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,192
I hear you're leaving for
the capital tomorrow.

161
00:07:23,275 --> 00:07:26,358
Would you please consider
taking me with you?

162
00:07:26,442 --> 00:07:29,858
[NAOFUMI] She must've found out
about me from the villagers...

163
00:07:29,942 --> 00:07:32,608
I realize it's a selfish
request, but you see...

164
00:07:32,692 --> 00:07:33,858
I just...

165
00:07:33,942 --> 00:07:35,858
I just have to return to
the capital right away!

166
00:07:35,942 --> 00:07:37,567
I beg you!

167
00:07:37,650 --> 00:07:39,275
[NAOFUMI] If she's a
nobleman's daughter,

168
00:07:39,358 --> 00:07:42,108
we might get a reward,
but it could cause problems

169
00:07:42,192 --> 00:07:43,942
if I'm the one
who takes her home.

170
00:07:44,025 --> 00:07:45,942
Uh. Huh?

171
00:07:46,025 --> 00:07:50,358
It's important, Master.
I really want you to help her.

172
00:07:50,442 --> 00:07:51,858
[RAPHTALIA]
Master Naofumi...

173
00:07:51,942 --> 00:07:54,817
We can't turn her away when
she's in trouble like that.

174
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:56,983
I want you to help her, too.

175
00:07:57,067 --> 00:07:58,608
[NAOFUMI]
Uh--

176
00:07:58,692 --> 00:08:00,900
[sighs]

177
00:08:00,983 --> 00:08:03,650
Well, you're gonna have to
cough up a reward, y'know.

178
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:07,358
Of course, I'll ask my
father, he'll be glad to!

179
00:08:07,442 --> 00:08:09,025
[FILO laughs]
We did it.

[CHIEF 9A]
Our Savior,

183
00:08:15,733 --> 00:08:18,275
we truly can't find
the words to thank you.

184
00:08:18,358 --> 00:08:20,817
Yeah, well, I'd rather have
money than thank-yous.

185
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:22,067
The next time I come around,

186
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:23,817
I'll collect the
money you owe me.

187

[CHIEF 9A]
Oh, of course!

188
00:08:33,650 --> 00:08:34,733
Okay, Filo...

[FILO]
Here we go!

[NAOFUMI]
Did I wake you?

191
00:09:45,275 --> 00:09:48,650
No, no... I can keep watch now
if you want to go to sleep.

192
00:09:48,733 --> 00:09:51,567
[NAOFUMI] It's fine.
You can sleep for tonight.

193
00:09:53,817 --> 00:09:55,775
[RAPHTALIA]
They're both so quiet now.

Yeah, it's funny after all the
noise they were making earlier.

[RAPHTALIA]
Aren't you cold?

196
00:10:00,317 --> 00:10:01,775
Not really.

We can't have you
catching a chill.

[RAPHTALIA]
Huh? Where's Mel?

200

[NAOFUMI]
Huh?

00:10:28,233 --> 00:10:29,900
You don't think...

202
00:10:29,983 --> 00:10:32,400
Uh-uh. There's no way.

203
00:10:32,483 --> 00:10:34,025
I can't believe that Filo--!

204
00:10:34,108 --> 00:10:35,608
[NAOFUMI]
Well, remember, she did say

205
00:10:35,692 --> 00:10:37,483
even her own kind
looked yummy...

206
00:10:37,567 --> 00:10:39,108
[RAPHTALIA]
Yes, but...

We saw nothing, okay?

00:10:45,567 --> 00:10:47,567
[RAPHTALIA]
Wha--?! What are you saying?!

211
00:10:47,650 --> 00:10:49,233
[NAOFUMI]
If we destroy the evidence...

212
00:10:49,317 --> 00:10:50,858
[RAPHTALIA]
You can't be serious!

213
00:10:50,942 --> 00:10:52,983
[NAOFUMI] What, you think it's
better for us to confess that

214
00:10:53,067 --> 00:10:55,567
Filo ate some
nobleman's daughter?!

215
00:10:58,150 --> 00:11:00,858
[FILO]
Is something wrong, Master?

216
00:11:00,942 --> 00:11:04,317
Filo, what have you
done with Mel?

217
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,858
What do you mean?

218
00:11:05,942 --> 00:11:08,317
She's sleeping in my feathers,
she has been all night long.

[NAOFUMI, RAPHTALIA]
Hm?

220
00:11:09,233 --> 00:11:11,608
Time to wake up, Mel!

[NAOFUMI]
What are you doing?

225
00:11:18,192 --> 00:11:20,567
Filo's feathers are so
soft and comfortable

226
00:11:20,650 --> 00:11:22,525
I couldn't resist
going to sleep...

227
00:11:22,608 --> 00:11:24,442
[NAOFUMI]
So you took off your clothes?

228
00:11:24,525 --> 00:11:25,942
[MELTY]
Mm-hm.

229
00:11:26,025 --> 00:11:28,150
But how'd you get in there?

[RAPHTALIA gasps]

231
00:11:30,650 --> 00:11:35,108

It's so nice and warm.

[NAOFUMI sighs]

233
00:11:40,025 --> 00:11:43,275
Do these feathers have some
kind of sleep-inducing power?

Uh?

I really can't
thank you all enough.

if I take Mel home?

Okay, just make sure
you collect the reward.

I think we'll miss her.

00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,817
I'm sure we'll see her again.

Uh-huh.

246
00:12:42,108 --> 00:12:44,442

the only one missing?

If it isn't the Shield Hero.

00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:05,483
Welcome to our
humble church, my son.

252
00:13:05,567 --> 00:13:09,108
I saw your magnificent
duel at the royal palace.

253
00:13:10,317 --> 00:13:13,108
I must say, the way you fought
with the odds stacked against

254
00:13:13,192 --> 00:13:16,150
you made a profound impression
on me, and I couldn't believe

255
00:13:16,233 --> 00:13:20,108
you held your own despite
wielding only a shield.

256
00:13:20,192 --> 00:13:21,900
[RAPHTALIA]
Master Naofumi...

257
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:26,650
Spare me the pleasantries.

258
00:13:26,733 --> 00:13:28,442
I need the most
powerful holy water

259
00:13:28,525 --> 00:13:30,067
you have to get rid of a curse.

260
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:31,775
Holy water, is that it?

261
00:13:31,858 --> 00:13:32,900
[NAOFUMI]
Yeah.

262
00:13:32,983 --> 00:13:35,108
Done. Then please
make your offering.

263
00:13:35,192 --> 00:13:36,692
[NAOFUMI]
And that'd be...?

264
00:13:36,775 --> 00:13:39,358
If you want the most powerful
one, that'll be one gold coin.

265
00:13:39,442 --> 00:13:40,525
[NAOFUMI]
Fine by me.

266
00:13:40,608 --> 00:13:42,108
[RAPHTALIA]
Master Naofumi, you mustn't!

267
00:13:42,192 --> 00:13:44,025
That's too expensive!

268
00:13:44,108 --> 00:13:45,525
I don't mind.

269
00:13:45,608 --> 00:13:49,192
Compared to you, a gold coin
is worth absolutely nothing.

Master Naofumi...

271
00:13:57,775 --> 00:14:00,650
[NAOFUMI]
You want a gold coin for that?

272
00:14:01,608 --> 00:14:04,650
For what reason did you bring
the low-quality item, my dear?

273
00:14:04,733 --> 00:14:06,650
Well, I mean, uh...

274
00:14:06,733 --> 00:14:09,192
God is equally
compassionate to all.

275
00:14:09,275 --> 00:14:11,858
If you did this to satisfy
your personal beliefs,

276
00:14:11,942 --> 00:14:13,442
then you must repent.

277
00:14:13,525 --> 00:14:15,942
I hope I have made myself clear.

278
00:14:16,025 --> 00:14:18,733

I... I'm terribly sorry!

I apologize for my disciple.

No problem as long as
I get my money's worth.

I'm thankful for
your understanding.

That oughta do it.

show us the way to go.

Be grateful for his guidance.

Everything we have is given by
God's grace, never forget that.

Talk about patronizing.

Why are we running?

What else can we do?

This way.

Are you feeling okay? Eh?

299
00:15:21,192 --> 00:15:22,275
Uh-huh.

300
00:15:22,358 --> 00:15:24,275
I think he's after me,
so let's split up.

301
00:15:24,358 --> 00:15:26,192
That way he'll never
catch both of us.

Why don't you go get Filo.

Let's meet back at the carriage.

I'm not talking about her.

Huh?

00:16:11,983 --> 00:16:13,650
[MOTOYASU] I'm talking
about the blonde girl

with wings on her back.

322

I saw her with you,
so don't lie to me.

Wait, Filo?

Filo's her name.

How can you make
her your slave?!

326
00:16:23,775 --> 00:16:27,025
I've never seen a girl that
perfect. She's incredible.

327
00:16:27,108 --> 00:16:28,525
It's hard to believe
there's a girl

328
00:16:28,608 --> 00:16:31,400
who's just like Freon
from <i>Hellworld.</i>

I don't care.

ever since I got my first look
at that wonderful face.

you're talking about,

I'm simply doing my job as
the hero's aide, that's all.

Oh, so making him fight
in a public place

392
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,442
is your idea of aide, I see.

Do you dare to defy me,
your older sister?

be the next ruler, is that it?
