to almost all the nearby

Wait, the Three Heroes Church?

They worship the Sword,
Spear, and Bow Heroes.

It's Melromarc's state religion.

She must be
tired after everything.

Master Naofumi,
why did you choose

147
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:01,733
the kingdom of Siltvelt over
all the other possibilities?

148
00:09:01,817 --> 00:09:03,692
The extra security.

149
00:09:03,775 --> 00:09:06,442
There's gotta be a really good
reason they're trying so hard

to prevent us
from getting there.

perfect place to hide out.

to ask you, Sir Shield Hero.

What happened
between you and Father?

156

that the Shield Hero
should be treated well.

Come to think of it,
now that you mention it,

I don't know a single
thing about your mom.

She's the queen of

Queen, huh?

164
00:09:53,608 --> 00:09:55,525
Yes, that means
she's higher than Father

more powerful than the king?

Well, he is the king, after all!

I'm perfectly fine,
as you can well see.

The Shield Hero kept watch
over me, making sure I was safe.

This whole thing is happening
because Naofumi abducted you.

202
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:14,858
This is all a misunderstanding.

203

You see, someone is
plotting to have me killed.

204
00:12:17,442 --> 00:12:21,567
I asked him to take me with
him and to protect my life.

He's protecting you? Come on!

00:12:23,775 --> 00:12:26,358
[MELTY] What advantage could
the Shield Hero possibly stand

207
00:12:26,442 --> 00:12:28,900
to gain by abducting me?

208
00:12:28,983 --> 00:12:30,567
The queen told me

209
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:33,608
this is the time for all
of us to work together.

210

It's the only way we'll be able
to thwart the catastrophes.

Our world can't
withstand any more

was a setup from the beginning.

I have no secrets.

00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:53,192
I'll tell you everything
I know. And then--

217

[MYNE] I command you
not to listen to him!

218
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:59,400
That lying devil possesses
a brainwashing shield!

219
00:12:59,483 --> 00:13:02,817
It allows him take over your
mind by simply talking to you--

220
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:05,483
it's the most dangerous
weapon he has!

221
00:13:05,567 --> 00:13:06,858
Wha...?

222
00:13:06,942 --> 00:13:08,733
Who would believe something
so stupid and silly?!

223
00:13:08,817 --> 00:13:11,525
The Three Heroes Church
has discovered that heretics

224

who worship the Shield have
started popping up all over

227
00:13:19,025 --> 00:13:20,817
The Devil of the Shield
calls himself

228
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:22,775
"the Savior of
the Heavenly Fowl"

229
00:13:22,858 --> 00:13:25,108
and goes around
brainwashing the innocent!

Melty, my dear, little,
deranged creature!

232
00:13:30,025 --> 00:13:31,775
It's obvious that
Devil of the Shield

233
00:13:31,858 --> 00:13:34,025
has already brainwashed you.

234
00:13:34,108 --> 00:13:35,442
Now I see!

235
00:13:35,525 --> 00:13:36,900
That means that
Raphtalia and Filo

236
00:13:36,983 --> 00:13:39,067
were brainwashed
by Naofumi, too.

237
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:40,317
No, you're wrong!

238

Master Naofumi hasn't
brainwashed any of us!

If my shield really
had the ability to do that,

we wouldn't be in this damned
situation in the first place!

241
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:50,442
Do we have a
guarantee that it can't?

242
00:13:50,525 --> 00:13:52,233
What kind of proof can
you give to convince us

243
00:13:52,317 --> 00:13:54,150
that you're not lying?

244
00:13:55,358 --> 00:13:58,025

the princess right now,

00:18:32,233 --> 00:18:34,192
It's my turn now!

322
00:18:34,275 --> 00:18:36,733
[yells]

323
00:18:37,983 --> 00:18:41,442
Annihilate the Devil of the
Shield and his whole party!

324
00:18:41,525 --> 00:18:43,858
[KNIGHTS yelling]

325
00:18:43,942 --> 00:18:45,733
[REN]
Wait, don't!

326
00:18:48,192 --> 00:18:50,567
[KNIGHTS yelling]

327
00:18:53,483 --> 00:18:54,733
[KNIGHTS scream]

328
00:18:54,817 --> 00:18:56,817
That light, what is it?

329
00:19:06,067 --> 00:19:08,358
[REN]
What the hell's going on?

330
00:19:08,442 --> 00:19:10,275
[NAOFUMI]
Ren...

331
00:19:10,358 --> 00:19:13,108
I know you'll be able
to figure this all out--

332
00:19:13,192 --> 00:19:16,025
what's really happening here.

333
00:19:16,108 --> 00:19:17,900
Wait, Naofumi!

334
00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:36,233
[FILO]
Yay!

335
00:19:37,942 --> 00:19:39,108
[rustling]

336
00:19:41,817 --> 00:19:43,108
[MELTY]
Wait!

337
00:19:43,192 --> 00:19:45,608
She's on our side.

338
00:19:45,692 --> 00:19:47,025
That's one of the Shadows,

339
00:19:47,108 --> 00:19:50,525
an espionage squad under
the queen's direct control.

340
00:19:50,608 --> 00:19:52,233
Sir Shield Hero,

341
00:19:52,317 --> 00:19:53,775
this is the first time
I'm meeting you

342
00:19:53,858 --> 00:19:55,692
in this form, I daresay.

343
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:58,108
"Daresay." What's that about?

344
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:02,775
[SHADOW] Allow me to
get straight to the point.

345
00:20:02,858 --> 00:20:06,317
Sir Shield Hero, you are
hereby requested to meet with

346
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,233
Her Majesty the Queen.

347
00:20:08,317 --> 00:20:09,817
With the queen?

348
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:12,817
The roots of this commotion
go deep, you understand?

349
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:16,108
I daresay we would appreciate
all the help you can give.

350
00:20:16,192 --> 00:20:18,858
This abduction and the events
leading up to it were set up

351
00:20:18,942 --> 00:20:22,108
by those who find your
accomplishments alarming.

352
00:20:22,192 --> 00:20:23,233
Oh, that's terrific,

353
00:20:23,317 --> 00:20:25,358
more pains in the
butt to deal handle.

354
00:20:25,442 --> 00:20:27,150
Yeah? So?

355
00:20:27,233 --> 00:20:28,775
What would I gain
by meeting with her?

356
00:20:28,858 --> 00:20:30,775
I have no doubt you'll
understand better

357
00:20:30,858 --> 00:20:33,233
after you've met, I daresay.

358
00:20:39,108 --> 00:20:40,900
[NAOFUMI] The queen's
in the opposite direction

359
00:20:40,983 --> 00:20:42,692
from Siltvelt.

360
00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:47,233
Hey, Second Princess, you know
anything about this country?

361
00:20:48,525 --> 00:20:50,525
Oh, yeah, Second Princess.

362
00:20:50,608 --> 00:20:53,233
You know how to
use magic, don't you?

363
00:20:53,317 --> 00:20:55,608
[MELTY]
Don't call me that.

364
00:20:55,692 --> 00:20:56,983
[NAOFUMI]
What was that, Second Princess?

365
00:20:57,067 --> 00:20:59,067
Stop calling me Second Princess!

366
00:20:59,150 --> 00:21:01,650
What's gotten into
you all of a sudden?

367
00:21:04,358 --> 00:21:07,150
I have a name,
and it's Melty, that's what!

368
00:21:07,233 --> 00:21:08,942
Why on earth do
you keep calling me

369
00:21:09,025 --> 00:21:11,275
"Second Princess," Shield Hero?

370
00:21:11,358 --> 00:21:14,483
You keep treating me like
I'm just an outsider!

371
00:21:14,567 --> 00:21:15,733
Hey, you're the only
one around here

372
00:21:15,817 --> 00:21:17,900
calling me "Shield
Hero," y'know.

373
00:21:17,983 --> 00:21:20,317
Well then... I'll have
to call you Naofumi.

374
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:23,983
And you can call me Melty,
which is what I prefer anyway.

375
00:21:24,067 --> 00:21:26,608
So tell me, Naofumi,
what's it going to be?

376
00:21:26,692 --> 00:21:28,567
Straight to his first name?

377
00:21:28,650 --> 00:21:30,983
Well, Second Princess,
y'see, it's like this...

378
00:21:31,067 --> 00:21:32,733
--Hey, wait!
--[NAOFUMI] Okay.

379
00:21:32,817 --> 00:21:34,108
[NAOFUMI]
Melty.

380
00:21:34,192 --> 00:21:35,483
Happy now?

381
00:21:35,567 --> 00:21:37,108
Once again, please...

382
00:21:37,192 --> 00:21:38,567
Huh?

383
00:21:38,650 --> 00:21:41,067
[MELTY]
Say my name one more time.

384
00:21:41,150 --> 00:21:42,400
Fine, Melty.

385
00:21:42,483 --> 00:21:45,775
Good. And I suggest
you don't forget it, either.

386
00:21:45,858 --> 00:21:47,400
One more thing...

387
00:21:47,483 --> 00:21:49,483
Thanks for that.

388
00:21:49,567 --> 00:21:51,942
[NAOFUMI]
Hmm? What's up?

389
00:21:52,025 --> 00:21:53,025
Nothing!

390
00:21:53,108 --> 00:21:54,483
I'm fine, just forget it.

391
00:21:54,567 --> 00:21:55,817
[gasps]

392
00:21:57,942 --> 00:22:00,317
Where's that smell coming from?

393
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:16,858
[MYNE giggling]
