strange about the Church,

so we quietly started
investigating them.

215
00:10:35,358 --> 00:10:36,733
We discovered a secret file

that had been hidden in
the Cathedral archives.

217

[ITSUKI] It described a replica

We decided it would
be a good idea

Clearly, they didn't
like that very much.

We never found
the replica because

lured us to a fake shrine,

Let's go.

475
00:20:38,650 --> 00:20:40,150
We finally fight as one!

476
00:20:40,233 --> 00:20:41,817
Heroes unite!

477
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:42,817
Time to fight!

478
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:44,817

Ready!

[POPE] Fighting with the
Devil of the Shield?

481
00:20:52,442 --> 00:20:56,358
A foolish decision befitting
false heroes such as yourselves.

482
00:20:56,442 --> 00:20:59,567
The only fate you deserve
is to be purged completely,

483
00:20:59,650 --> 00:21:02,358
and no trace of any
of you shall remain.

484
00:21:02,442 --> 00:21:06,525
[CLERGY] We pray to our God,
the source of all power.

485
00:21:06,608 --> 00:21:10,817
Decipher the laws of nature,
bring about a miracle,

486
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:12,942
and protect the blessed ones!

487
00:21:13,025 --> 00:21:16,567
And now for group defense
magic of the highest level:

488
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:18,817
Cathedral!

[POPE] Welcome to my
Cathedral sanctuary!

495
00:21:55,442 --> 00:21:56,650
Time to make your peace,

496
00:21:56,733 --> 00:21:59,733
as it will be your
final resting place.
