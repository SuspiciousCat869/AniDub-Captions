1
00:01:43,525 --> 00:01:46,233
[NAOFUMI] Off the coast of Cal
Mira in an underwater temple,

2
00:01:46,317 --> 00:01:48,692
we found another
dragon hourglass,

3
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:51,650
alerting us to prepare
for the incoming Wave.

4
00:01:58,317 --> 00:01:59,567
[NAOFUMI]
'Kay, Raphtalia?

5
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:01,150
[RAPHTALIA]
Sure.

6
00:02:01,233 --> 00:02:03,192
Give me First Light.

7
00:02:08,442 --> 00:02:09,775
[NAOFUMI gasps]

8
00:02:12,233 --> 00:02:15,192
[NAOFUMI] No way!
That's a dragon hourglass!

9
00:02:15,275 --> 00:02:18,983
If a Wave attacks this place,
the islanders will all die!

10
00:02:24,733 --> 00:02:27,567
This says the next
Wave is coming...

11
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:29,692
...in just two days!

12
00:02:31,483 --> 00:02:33,233
[NAOFUMI]
I used my teleport skill

13
00:02:33,317 --> 00:02:35,567
and returned to the capital.

14
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:37,192
I explained things to the queen

15
00:02:37,275 --> 00:02:40,442
and she immediately gathered her
army to prepare for the battle.

16
00:02:41,858 --> 00:02:42,858
[NAOFUMI]
It was clear that this Wave

17
00:02:42,942 --> 00:02:45,858
would most likely occur at sea.

18
00:02:45,942 --> 00:02:47,400
So now we've boarded our ships

19
00:02:47,483 --> 00:02:51,108
and we're just waiting to
be teleported to the Wave.

20
00:02:51,192 --> 00:02:55,400
Actually, the queen was the one
who arranged for these ships.

21
00:02:55,483 --> 00:02:57,442
And unlike that trash king,

22
00:02:57,525 --> 00:02:59,942
she's a shrewd and
effective leader.

23
00:03:00,025 --> 00:03:01,817
I don't know how,
but we made it.

24
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:03,400
Honestly I'm impressed
you managed to

25
00:03:03,483 --> 00:03:05,692
put together an army
on such short notice.

26
00:03:05,775 --> 00:03:08,067
Oh, it really wasn't a big deal.

27
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:09,192
Preparing for the Waves

28
00:03:09,275 --> 00:03:11,858
is the royal family's
responsibility.

29
00:03:11,942 --> 00:03:13,775
[NAOFUMI]
What are you doing here?

30
00:03:13,858 --> 00:03:15,317
What's that supposed to mean?!

31
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,317
Uh--

32
00:03:17,442 --> 00:03:18,817
[MELTY]
I'm here because...

33
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:20,442
...I'm part of your party.

34
00:03:20,525 --> 00:03:22,108
I'm happy you're here.

35
00:03:22,192 --> 00:03:25,900
I'm always happy when
I get to see you.

36
00:03:25,983 --> 00:03:27,817
Aw, thanks, Filo.

37
00:03:28,858 --> 00:03:30,692
I feel the same.

38
00:03:31,733 --> 00:03:33,317
Do you think that the
people of Cal Mira

39
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:36,067
will be able to get off
the island in time?

40
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:38,483
[MIRELIA] The Earl of
Habenburg acted quickly.

41
00:03:38,567 --> 00:03:42,192
He's already finished evacuating
all of the islanders.

42
00:03:42,275 --> 00:03:44,483
Besides, we have
every reason to believe

43
00:03:44,567 --> 00:03:47,233
this Wave will be
happening out at sea.

44
00:03:47,317 --> 00:03:50,692
Right now, all you need to
worry about is the battle.

45
00:03:50,775 --> 00:03:55,108
You got a point, but we sure
don't wanna get complacent.

46
00:03:55,192 --> 00:03:56,608
And, no matter what,

47
00:03:56,692 --> 00:04:00,650
the other heroes still don't
seem to wanna work together.

48
00:04:00,733 --> 00:04:01,650
[MIRELIA]
They seem to think

49
00:04:01,733 --> 00:04:04,358
leveling up at Cal
Mira was enough.

50
00:04:04,442 --> 00:04:05,692
Yeah, and now it
looks like things are

51
00:04:05,775 --> 00:04:08,525
about to get ugly again. [sighs]

52
00:04:09,567 --> 00:04:10,567
[RAPHTALIA]
Master Naofumi.

53
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:12,233
[NAOFUMI]
Hm?

54
00:04:12,317 --> 00:04:14,692
[RAPHTALIA]
It's L'Arc and Therese!

55
00:04:14,775 --> 00:04:17,358
[NAOFUMI]
They're fighting the Wave, too?

56
00:04:17,442 --> 00:04:18,483
You know them?

57
00:04:18,567 --> 00:04:21,608
Yeah. They helped
us in Cal Mira.

58
00:04:21,692 --> 00:04:23,192
I'm glad they're on our side.

59
00:04:23,275 --> 00:04:25,858
They're more reliable
than the other heroes.

60
00:04:25,942 --> 00:04:27,317
Wow.

61
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:30,400
It's not often you put so
much trust in other people.

62
00:04:31,733 --> 00:04:32,983
[gasps]

63
00:04:42,233 --> 00:04:44,567
It will begin when we teleport.

64
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:47,400
Everyone, prepare for battle!

65
00:04:57,775 --> 00:05:00,358
Great. Here we go!

66
00:05:19,483 --> 00:05:20,817
What are those?

67
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:23,942
Those are cask bombs.
They're made out of cohol fruit.

68
00:05:24,025 --> 00:05:25,150
[NAOFUMI]
Hm?

69
00:05:25,233 --> 00:05:26,942
Cohol fruit?

70
00:05:28,733 --> 00:05:30,150
I get it.

71
00:05:30,233 --> 00:05:33,483
Concentrated alcohol affects
monsters as much as people.

72
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:35,150
[SOLDIERS yell]

73
00:05:39,942 --> 00:05:42,483
Do not let up.
Keep on firing at them!

74
00:05:42,567 --> 00:05:44,275
Sir Itsuki!

75

[SAILORS yell]

79
00:06:08,567 --> 00:06:11,733
We can't hit it unless we
get it out of the water!

80
00:06:11,817 --> 00:06:13,275
[NAOFUMI]
Filo! Let's go!

81
00:06:13,358 --> 00:06:15,025
[FILO]
You got it!

82
00:06:18,692 --> 00:06:20,400
[NAOFUMI]
Lucky me.

83
00:06:21,442 --> 00:06:23,192
[MIRELIA] Shield Hero,
we're going to need you

84
00:06:23,275 --> 00:06:25,567
to keep the biggest
monster in check.

85
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:26,775
You make it sound so easy,

86
00:06:26,858 --> 00:06:29,108
but don't forget,
that thing's underwater.

87
00:06:29,192 --> 00:06:31,817
That's why it has to be you.

88
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:33,275
[FILO]
Huh?

89
00:06:42,067 --> 00:06:44,025
[NAOFUMI]
Hate Reaction!

90
00:06:55,483 --> 00:06:57,192
[NAOFUMI]
It took the bait!

[MIRELIA gasps]

00:07:38,108 --> 00:07:39,525
Well that's not good.

100
00:07:39,608 --> 00:07:42,317
It doesn't even look like they
made a dent in that thing.

101

[RAPHTALIA grunts]

102

[growls]

103
00:07:51,567 --> 00:07:53,025
Now that she's
leveled up a little,

104
00:07:53,108 --> 00:07:55,233
Raphtalia's dealing a
hell of a lot more damage

105
00:07:55,317 --> 00:07:57,025
than those three are.

106
00:07:57,108 --> 00:08:00,567
But still, she can't
finish that thing.

107
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:01,775
Don't worry about the big one,

108
00:08:01,858 --> 00:08:03,817
the heroes will have
to take care of that!

109

You and your friend here

not have a choice.

got something to fight for.

00:18:06,817 --> 00:18:09,650
[NAOFUMI]
Trying to throw me off my game.

325
00:18:09,733 --> 00:18:11,067
[MELTY]
Naofumi!

326
00:18:11,150 --> 00:18:12,108
[FILO]
It's Mel!

327
00:18:12,192 --> 00:18:13,400
[NAOFUMI]
How'd you get here?

328
00:18:13,483 --> 00:18:15,192
I commandeered a ride.

329
00:18:15,275 --> 00:18:16,775
[whines]

330
00:18:16,858 --> 00:18:18,817
You haven't finished
this Wave yet.

331
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:21,192
So hurry up and beat
these guys already,

332
00:18:21,275 --> 00:18:24,400
then finish the Wave
so we can go home!

333
00:18:24,483 --> 00:18:25,442
[chuckles]

334
00:18:25,525 --> 00:18:27,192
[MELTY]
Wh-What?

335
00:18:27,275 --> 00:18:28,692
Nothin'.

336
00:18:28,775 --> 00:18:31,275
L'Arc. You've got
a sound strategy.

337
00:18:31,358 --> 00:18:35,108
Those defense-reversing attacks
will totally mess me up...

338
00:18:35,192 --> 00:18:38,067
...unless I figure out
how to dodge all of 'em.

339
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:40,275
They'll be worthless
against my Air Strike Shield

340
00:18:40,358 --> 00:18:41,358
and Second Shield.

341
00:18:41,442 --> 00:18:42,525
[chuckles]

342
00:18:42,608 --> 00:18:45,442
[NAOFUMI]
So I will use them if I have to.

343
00:18:45,525 --> 00:18:46,900
Naofumi!

344
00:18:46,983 --> 00:18:49,275
Why would you tell him how
you're going to defeat him?!

345
00:18:49,358 --> 00:18:50,775
It's fair.

346
00:18:53,150 --> 00:18:56,317
Looks like we've both got
our cards on the table.

347
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,358
In that case,

348
00:18:57,442 --> 00:18:58,483
let's do it!

[NAOFUMI] He's still standing
even after our best combo?

371
00:19:48,608 --> 00:19:51,400
[L'ARC]
Honestly, that really hurt.

372
00:19:51,483 --> 00:19:53,608
You know how to make
perfect use of that shield,

373
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:54,775
don't you, kiddo?

374
00:19:54,858 --> 00:19:56,317
You are good!

375
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:59,858
When you told us you'd be using
Air Strike Shield for defense,

376
00:19:59,942 --> 00:20:01,692
we never imagined
that you'd actually

377
00:20:01,775 --> 00:20:03,775
use it as a trap against us.

378
00:20:03,858 --> 00:20:05,775
And you're good at
mind games, too.

379
00:20:05,858 --> 00:20:07,025
[NAOFUMI]
Therese can switch between

380
00:20:07,108 --> 00:20:09,192
offense and defense at will.

381
00:20:09,275 --> 00:20:11,108
She deliberately
used that AOE spell

382
00:20:11,192 --> 00:20:14,275
to make us stop our
attacks against L'Arc.

383
00:20:14,358 --> 00:20:15,525
They're not lying.

384
00:20:15,608 --> 00:20:18,067
They really are heroes
from another world.

385
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:19,192
Their spirit.

386
00:20:19,275 --> 00:20:20,608
Their strength.

387
00:20:20,692 --> 00:20:23,358
Honestly, they're more heroic
than the "heroes" here.

388
00:20:23,442 --> 00:20:24,983
Stop it!

389
00:20:25,067 --> 00:20:26,442
[L'ARC]
I was bored out of my mind

390
00:20:26,525 --> 00:20:28,858
fighting those
monsters on Cal Mira.

391
00:20:28,942 --> 00:20:30,942
But there's nothing better
than a man-to-man battle

392
00:20:31,025 --> 00:20:33,650
with real strategy involved.

393
00:20:33,733 --> 00:20:36,942
[NAOFUMI] This isn't the time to
be admiring how worthy they are.

394
00:20:37,025 --> 00:20:38,900
It's kill or be killed.

395
00:20:38,983 --> 00:20:41,442
I know that, and yet...

396
00:20:41,525 --> 00:20:43,233
[L'ARC]
Isn't this fun, Naofumi?

What are you doing here?

Who is that woman?

makes me shiver.

That's Glass.

412
00:21:20,192 --> 00:21:22,358
She almost killed us
during the last Wave.

413
00:21:22,442 --> 00:21:24,067
And now...

414
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:26,275
...it appears that
she's on their side.

So good to see
you again, Naofumi.

[NAOFUMI] I can't say
the feeling is mutual.

[NAOFUMI grunts]

421
00:21:48,192 --> 00:21:51,275
From the looks of his shield,
you haven't seen his best yet.

422
00:21:51,358 --> 00:21:53,442
His best? What do you mean?

423
00:21:53,525 --> 00:21:55,983
When he gets serious,
he brings out something that's

424
00:21:56,067 --> 00:21:57,775
--far more ominous.
--Huh?!

425
00:21:57,858 --> 00:22:01,317
You did that much damage to
L'Arc and blocked my attacks,

426
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:03,650
all without using
your trump card.

427
00:22:03,733 --> 00:22:05,817
You have grown
stronger, Naofumi.

428
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:08,567
Jeez, are you tryin'
to flatter me now?

429
00:22:08,650 --> 00:22:10,067
Don't get cocky.

430
00:22:10,150 --> 00:22:14,400
You can see now that I must
do this with my own hands.
