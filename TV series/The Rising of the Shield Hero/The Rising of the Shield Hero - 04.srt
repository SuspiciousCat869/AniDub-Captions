strike using the shield?

That'll never--[gasps]

162
00:07:59,525 --> 00:08:01,067
[groans] What--?

163
00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:02,275
Get off!

164
00:08:02,358 --> 00:08:05,942
A balloon? Used as
a battle weapon?

Heh.

167
00:08:09,942 --> 00:08:12,442
Tell me, what the
hell are you up to?

168
00:08:12,525 --> 00:08:14,275
If it's true that I can't win,

169
00:08:14,358 --> 00:08:16,817
I'm gonna hurt you as
much as I possibly can.

170
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:18,025
Like hell!

171

[MOTOYASU] C'mon, Shield Hero!
You gotta fight fair!

172

[MOTOYASU gasps]
Get off of me!

Hey! Stop that! No!

Hey! That hurts!

[SPECTATOR 4A]
It can't be.

179
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:47,567
[SPECTATOR 4B] At this rate,
the Shield Hero might win.

180
00:08:47,650 --> 00:08:50,483
Naofumi and his shield
have the upper hand.

181
00:08:50,567 --> 00:08:51,858
[REN]
Hm.

182
00:08:54,650 --> 00:08:56,275
Does that lowly Shield Hero

183
00:08:56,358 --> 00:08:58,275
think he can win
against the Spear Hero?

184
00:08:58,358 --> 00:09:01,233
Have you no respect for
the sanctity of a duel?!

[grunts]

186
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:08,150
[NAOFUMI] It's time for
you to admit defeat.

187
00:09:08,233 --> 00:09:11,233
Or do you want more
embarrassment, tough guy?

188
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:15,483
[MOTOYASU exhales] And why
would I ever surrender now?

189
00:09:16,608 --> 00:09:18,525
[NAOFUMI]
All right, I see.

190
00:09:18,608 --> 00:09:21,692
So then. Guess I'll take
aim at your handsome face

191
00:09:21,775 --> 00:09:23,692
and that precious
manhood of yours.

192

[gasps]

193
00:09:24,983 --> 00:09:26,733
Might as well, since
I'm a cowardly cheater!

194
00:09:26,817 --> 00:09:29,317
Ahh! No!

You didn't win.

[MOTOYASU]
Huh?

213
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:37,400
So what happened to this
being a one-on-one duel?

214
00:10:37,483 --> 00:10:39,525
And it's obvious
that you didn't win.

215
00:10:39,608 --> 00:10:40,900
What?

216
00:10:40,983 --> 00:10:43,567
[NAOFUMI] That magician
butted in and gave you help!

217
00:10:43,650 --> 00:10:46,150
Ha! Little man's a sore loser?

218
00:10:46,233 --> 00:10:47,442
It's the truth!

219
00:10:47,525 --> 00:10:50,233
Everyone who was watching
her could see it!

220
00:10:50,317 --> 00:10:53,775
You all saw Myne use
her magic, didn't you?

221
00:10:53,858 --> 00:10:55,400
I know you saw it!

222
00:10:55,483 --> 00:10:58,608
She used her magic
to help him win!

223
00:11:01,525 --> 00:11:02,608
There's no way.

224
00:11:02,692 --> 00:11:04,150
They must have seen it.

225
00:11:04,233 --> 00:11:07,608
I shall listen to no more
arguments about this battle.

226
00:11:07,692 --> 00:11:11,108
Brave Spear Hero,
you have won the duel!

227
00:11:11,192 --> 00:11:13,983
[MYNE giggles]
I knew you would win.

[sighs]

231
00:11:25,358 --> 00:11:29,108
Too bad, Shield Hero. You must
be so upset about your loss.

232
00:11:29,192 --> 00:11:30,692
It really is such a shame

233
00:11:30,775 --> 00:11:34,025
that you'll have to go back
to fighting all by yourself.

Your fighting was brilliant,
Master Motoyasu.

[MOTOYASU]
Sir.

238
00:11:43,775 --> 00:11:45,233
Now I know why
my daughter, Malty,

239
00:11:45,317 --> 00:11:47,025
chooses to believe
so much in you.

240

[MYNE giggles]
You see, Papa?

[NAOFUMI gasps]

242
00:11:50,775 --> 00:11:52,442
[MOTOYASU] I gotta say,
it was a total shock

243
00:11:52,525 --> 00:11:54,692
to learn that Myne was
the King's daughter.

244
00:11:54,775 --> 00:11:56,025
[MYNE]
I am.

245
00:11:56,108 --> 00:11:58,817
But I fight to contribute
to the world's peace.

246
00:12:00,025 --> 00:12:05,275
[NAOFUMI] So... this entire
thing... was planned!

247
00:12:05,358 --> 00:12:06,692
The princess framed me

248
00:12:06,775 --> 00:12:10,442
to get in the good graces
of her favorite hero.

249
00:12:10,525 --> 00:12:15,442
And her father twisted the facts
to please his dear daughter.

250
00:12:15,525 --> 00:12:18,983
Even this duel was
a setup all along!

251
00:12:19,067 --> 00:12:21,817
I know that the Shield Hero
has forced that poor girl

252
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:23,150
to be his slave.

253
00:12:23,233 --> 00:12:25,192
You must save her.

254
00:12:25,275 --> 00:12:26,358
[MOTOYASU gasps]

255
00:12:28,317 --> 00:12:30,608
[NAOFUMI]
I just don't understand...

256
00:12:30,692 --> 00:12:33,650
...why they want to
see me fail like this.

257
00:12:35,483 --> 00:12:39,150
[NAOFUMI] I didn't come to
this world because I wanted to.

258
00:12:39,233 --> 00:12:40,733
You wanted it!

259
00:12:40,817 --> 00:12:42,983
You summoned me here!

260
00:12:43,067 --> 00:12:46,108
So why are they
doing this to me?

261
00:12:46,192 --> 00:12:49,108
The girl who was enslaved
by the cowardly Shield Hero

262
00:12:49,192 --> 00:12:52,317
has been given her freedom
by the triumphant Spear Hero!

263
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,733
[SPECTATORS gasp]

264
00:12:53,817 --> 00:12:55,150
[NOBLEWOMAN 4E] It's clear
that we should never have

265
00:12:55,233 --> 00:12:58,525
summoned the Shield
Hero to begin with!

266
00:12:58,608 --> 00:13:00,192
The other three serve us well!

267
00:13:00,275 --> 00:13:02,233
We should just get rid
of that criminal scum

268
00:13:02,317 --> 00:13:03,608
as soon as possible.

269
00:13:03,692 --> 00:13:05,025
[NOBLEMAN 4F] Our country
doesn't need the Shield!

270
00:13:05,108 --> 00:13:07,692
[NOBLEMAN 4G] Execute
the Shield Hero right away!

271
00:13:07,775 --> 00:13:10,025
[NAOFUMI]
How can this be happening?

272
00:13:10,108 --> 00:13:11,608
I hate the Shield!

273
00:13:11,692 --> 00:13:14,733
Come and take it off!

274
00:13:14,817 --> 00:13:19,108
Damn it! Damn it all!

275
00:13:21,025 --> 00:13:22,692
I just can't.

[RAPHTALIA groans, gasps]

There. You're free now.

Sir Motoyasu's kindness.

I'll never be rid of it.

293
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:39,900
A messed up world
like this one...

294
00:14:42,608 --> 00:14:45,775
[NAOFUMI]
...is not worth saving!

295
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:53,358
You're a liar and a cheat!

296

[MOTOYASU gasps]

297
00:14:54,483 --> 00:14:56,983
Don't! Sir Motoyasu
set you free!

298
00:14:57,067 --> 00:14:58,733
I never asked
anyone to free me.

299
00:14:58,817 --> 00:15:00,900
I was with Naofumi by choice!

300
00:15:00,983 --> 00:15:03,400
But wait a second.
I thought he was abusing you

301
00:15:03,483 --> 00:15:04,900
and that he was
treating you badly.

302
00:15:04,983 --> 00:15:07,692
You obviously know nothing
about Master Naofumi.

[MOTOYASU gasps]

304
00:15:08,983 --> 00:15:10,358
[RAPHTALIA]
He never abused me

305
00:15:10,442 --> 00:15:13,525
and he never made me do
anything I couldn't do!

306
00:15:13,608 --> 00:15:16,233
He activated the curse when
I was too scared to fight.

307
00:15:16,317 --> 00:15:17,900
He did it to protect both of us.

308
00:15:17,983 --> 00:15:20,192
[MOTOYASU grunts]
And that's the problem!

309
00:15:20,275 --> 00:15:22,650
Nobody should ever be
forced into a fight!

310
00:15:22,733 --> 00:15:25,025
[RAPHTALIA] Master Naofumi
can't use any weapons!

311
00:15:25,108 --> 00:15:27,650
The Shield defends,
so someone has to fight for him!

312
00:15:27,733 --> 00:15:29,692
But you don't have
to be that person.

313
00:15:29,775 --> 00:15:32,650
Don't you know he'll put
you in danger every time?

314
00:15:32,733 --> 00:15:34,608
[RAPHTALIA]
Master Naofumi defends me!

315
00:15:34,692 --> 00:15:37,692
We work as a team and he always
lets me rest when I'm tired!

316
00:15:37,775 --> 00:15:40,942
No way. He just

from being children,

472
00:22:57,733 --> 00:22:59,942
we become instant grown-ups
in the blink of an eye.

473
00:23:01,483 --> 00:23:04,233
[RAPHTALIA] That's why we are
seen as unnatural creatures,

474
00:23:04,317 --> 00:23:07,442
always abused and
discriminated against.

475
00:23:07,525 --> 00:23:09,025
[NAOFUMI]
I see.

476
00:23:09,108 --> 00:23:12,067
[RAPHTALIA giggles] Hey, this
sandwich really does taste good!

477
00:23:17,567 --> 00:23:19,025
[NAOFUMI gasps]

478
00:23:20,858 --> 00:23:22,775
Is something wrong?

479
00:23:22,858 --> 00:23:25,275
I can actually... taste it!

480
00:23:28,275 --> 00:23:29,442
Let's make a deal

481
00:23:29,525 --> 00:23:32,650
to eat lots of delicious
food from now on, okay?

482
00:23:36,108 --> 00:23:37,442
[RAPHTALIA]
Master Naofumi?

483
00:23:37,525 --> 00:23:38,650
[NAOFUMI]
Yeah?

484
00:23:38,733 --> 00:23:40,775
[RAPHTALIA]
Let's do the best we can.
