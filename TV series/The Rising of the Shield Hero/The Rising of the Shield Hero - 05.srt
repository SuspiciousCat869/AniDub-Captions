1
00:00:17,692 --> 00:00:20,858
[MIRELIA] Is that what
the king has been up to?

2
00:00:20,942 --> 00:00:22,233
He has, apparently.

3
00:00:22,317 --> 00:00:25,983
I'm sure Princess Malty
must've talked him into it.

4
00:00:26,067 --> 00:00:28,525
[MIRELIA] How is the
Shield Hero holding up?

5
00:00:28,608 --> 00:00:33,067
He procured a demi-human girl
from a slave trader a while ago.

6
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:35,317
[MIRELIA]
Is that so?

7
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:37,567
Well, that's a
relief, I must say.

8
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:39,108
However...

9
00:00:39,192 --> 00:00:41,650
News of Melromarc's summoning
of the Four Cardinal Heroes

10
00:00:41,733 --> 00:00:45,275
is making no small impact in
our kingdom as well as others.

11
00:00:45,358 --> 00:00:47,400
We must make sure we
prevent our neighbors

12
00:00:47,483 --> 00:00:50,983
from meddling in our affairs,
no matter what it may take.

13
00:00:51,067 --> 00:00:52,358
Never fear, my lady.

14
00:00:52,442 --> 00:00:54,108
We'll continue to
keep a watchful eye

15
00:00:54,192 --> 00:00:55,442
on events in the capital.

16
00:00:55,525 --> 00:00:57,150
[MIRELIA]
I'm counting on you.

17
00:01:10,608 --> 00:01:12,900
[AULTCRAY] As a reward for
his efforts during the Wave

18
00:01:12,983 --> 00:01:15,192
and for fulfilling my request,

19
00:01:15,275 --> 00:01:19,608
Master Motoyasu will
receive 4,000 silvers.

20
00:01:19,692 --> 00:01:25,400
And Young Masters Itsuki and
Ren will receive 3,800 silvers.

21
00:01:25,483 --> 00:01:29,775
Finally, I have set aside 500
silvers for the Shield Hero.

22
00:01:29,858 --> 00:01:31,442
--However...
--Huh?

23
00:01:31,525 --> 00:01:33,150
Since it's been offset
by the cost of

24
00:01:33,233 --> 00:01:35,483
setting his slave
free from her curse,

25
00:01:35,567 --> 00:01:38,317
he will not receive
any funds at this time.

26
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,608
[NAOFUMI grunts]

27
00:01:39,692 --> 00:01:41,817
[ITSUKI] Wait a second,
that's not gonna fly.

28
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:43,358
[RAPHTALIA, NAOFUMI gasp]

29
00:01:43,442 --> 00:01:45,900
You were the one interfering
in his duel, dispelling that...

30
00:01:45,983 --> 00:01:48,733
...slave crest,
or whatever you call it.

31
00:01:48,817 --> 00:01:50,233
Now you won't pay him?

32
00:01:50,317 --> 00:01:52,692
If you ask me,
that's not really fair play.

33
00:01:52,775 --> 00:01:54,233
Yeah, that's right.

34
00:01:54,317 --> 00:01:55,525
If you'd followed the rules,

35
00:01:55,608 --> 00:01:57,442
Naofumi clearly
would've won the duel.

36
00:01:57,525 --> 00:02:00,067
Wha-- Are you crazy?
I didn't lose!

37
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:01,858
I'm afraid you're both mistaken,

38
00:02:01,942 --> 00:02:03,858
Sir Itsuki, Sir Ren.

39
00:02:03,942 --> 00:02:05,983
It was supposed to be
a one-on-one duel,

40
00:02:06,067 --> 00:02:08,067
and the Shield Hero was
the one with monsters

41
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:09,817
hidden inside his cape.

42
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:11,608
That is the real reason
why Father didn't

43
00:02:11,692 --> 00:02:13,192
declare him the winner.

44
00:02:13,275 --> 00:02:16,692
[ITSUKI] Even so, you cheated
by firing a magic spell at him.

45
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:21,650
[MOTOYASU gasps]
Get off of me!

46
00:02:21,733 --> 00:02:24,692
[NAOFUMI] Might as well,
since I'm a cowardly cheater!

47
00:02:24,775 --> 00:02:27,817
[NAOFUMI gasps, groans]

48
00:02:32,858 --> 00:02:34,608
[REN]
Besides, when the Wave hit,

49
00:02:34,692 --> 00:02:38,233
it was Naofumi who defended
that village, not the knights.

50
00:02:41,442 --> 00:02:42,817
So if you ask me,

51
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:45,567
it would be the right thing
to fairly compensate him.

52
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:46,900
[MYNE grunts]

53
00:02:46,983 --> 00:02:49,692
Fine. I shall afford him
the minimum agreed amount,

54
00:02:49,775 --> 00:02:51,900
but there will be nothing else.

55
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,650
[AULTCRAY] Well, you have it,
so begone already!

00:02:55,733 --> 00:02:56,567

Master Naofumi!

58
00:02:58,108 --> 00:02:59,608
Isn't it great?

59
00:03:00,858 --> 00:03:02,650
[RAPHTALIA] There's no reason
for us to waste any more

60
00:03:02,733 --> 00:03:04,650
of our precious time here.

61

brand-new slave crest.

[NAOFUMI] There was no need
to get another one, you know.

00:05:08,483 --> 00:05:09,692
But I wanted it.

I think of it as a symbol
of your faith in me,

think it looks?

For a hundred silvers, you're
guaranteed at least a filolial!

[RAPHTALIA]
Certainly.

You surely must have
seen them around.

120
00:06:07,275 --> 00:06:08,817
They're those gigantic
birds everywhere

121

that pull people's
carriages around town.

[NAOFUMI]
Oh, those?

What's more, if ya
hit the jackpot...

124
00:06:18,192 --> 00:06:19,608
...you'll win a dragon!

beast is worth 20 gold pieces!

126
00:06:23,775 --> 00:06:25,067
Is it like a gacha game?

127
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:26,400
[RAPHTALIA]
What's a gacha game?

128
00:06:26,483 --> 00:06:28,650
Nothing. Just forget I said it.

129
00:06:28,733 --> 00:06:30,983
[SLAVE TRADER] So, would you
like to give it a shot?

Act now and I'll give ya
a package deal, sir!

131
00:06:33,692 --> 00:06:36,400
For that and the slave crest!

132
00:06:37,608 --> 00:06:38,942
[RAPHTALIA]
If you ask me,

133
00:06:39,025 --> 00:06:41,358
you shouldn't waste money
like that, Master Naofumi.

134
00:06:41,442 --> 00:06:42,900
Yeah, but after
thinking about it,

135
00:06:42,983 --> 00:06:45,900
I figured it wasn't fair to
make you fight all by yourself.

136
00:06:45,983 --> 00:06:47,275
At least this way,

137
00:06:47,358 --> 00:06:49,233
you can have a monster
that'll fight by your side.

138
00:06:49,317 --> 00:06:51,692
I fight just fine
all by myself!

139
00:06:51,775 --> 00:06:53,025
[NAOFUMI]
If that's the case,

140
00:06:53,108 --> 00:06:55,275
we can always sell it back
to the slave merchant.

141
00:06:55,358 --> 00:06:57,317
Well, either way,
you'd better stop

142
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,733
loosening your purse
strings so much.

143
00:06:59,817 --> 00:07:01,525
[NAOFUMI]
Yeah, yeah, fine.

144
00:07:01,608 --> 00:07:04,317
[HERBALIST 1A] I have lots of
relatives in Lute Village.

me to help you out here.

someone you saved back then?

has recipes for finer medicines

150
00:07:16,192 --> 00:07:17,942
Use it. It's yours.

151
00:07:18,025 --> 00:07:21,275
[NAOFUMI] Thanks, but I can't
read this world's language.

152
00:07:21,358 --> 00:07:22,650
There's something else.

153
00:07:22,733 --> 00:07:25,317
The old hag at the magic shop
was asking to see you.

154
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,900
It's for a similar reason.

out in that Lute Village battle.

00:07:30,608 --> 00:07:32,358
[MAGIC SHOPKEEPER 5A]
You have a rare affinity

157
00:07:32,442 --> 00:07:36,608
for healing and
support magic, Shield Hero.

158
00:07:36,692 --> 00:07:38,317
And the young lady
has affinities

159
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,358
for light and dark magic.

160
00:07:40,442 --> 00:07:42,608
She's half-raccoon, after all.

161
00:07:42,692 --> 00:07:45,400
Make sure she learns
illusion magic.

162
00:07:46,442 --> 00:07:48,692
[MAGIC SHOPKEEPER 5A]
Now, that being the case...

163
00:07:50,983 --> 00:07:54,108
We don't have the money to
buy a magic grimoire, though.

164
00:07:54,192 --> 00:07:57,192
It's a gift, as thanks
for helping my grandchild.

165
00:07:57,275 --> 00:07:59,692
I would've preferred to have
given you a crystal ball

166
00:07:59,775 --> 00:08:00,858
instead of it.

167
00:08:00,942 --> 00:08:02,358
Huh?

168
00:08:02,442 --> 00:08:03,692
[MAGIC SHOPKEEPER 5A] Oh,
you mean you didn't you know?

169
00:08:03,775 --> 00:08:05,442
If you use a crystal ball,

170
00:08:05,525 --> 00:08:07,983
you can learn one of the
magics sealed within it.

171
00:08:08,067 --> 00:08:10,025
[NAOFUMI]
First I ever heard of that.

172
00:08:10,108 --> 00:08:12,942
But I heard the royal court
had ordered a bunch of them

173
00:08:13,025 --> 00:08:14,483
to give to all the heroes.

174
00:08:14,567 --> 00:08:16,150
[NAOFUMI]
Yeah, they probably did.

175
00:08:16,233 --> 00:08:18,358
To every hero but me, that is.

176
00:08:18,442 --> 00:08:21,233
Learning magic from a
grimoire is certainly hard.

177
00:08:21,317 --> 00:08:23,233
But if you keep at
it and do the work,

178
00:08:23,317 --> 00:08:25,400
you can learn as many
spells as you want!

179
00:08:25,483 --> 00:08:26,942
You can do it!

180
00:08:27,025 --> 00:08:28,483
Thank you so much.

181
00:08:28,567 --> 00:08:29,775
[NAOFUMI gasps]

182
00:08:31,275 --> 00:08:33,525
[NAOFUMI]
"Thank you so much"?

183
00:08:36,317 --> 00:08:38,858
[NAOFUMI]
I really can't read it.

184
00:08:38,942 --> 00:08:40,400
I wish there was
some kind of skill

185
00:08:40,483 --> 00:08:42,525
that would translate
books for me.

186
00:08:42,608 --> 00:08:44,817
[RAPHTALIA]
Then let's learn it together.

187
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:46,983
The language and the magic?

188
00:08:48,317 --> 00:08:49,942
[RAPHTALIA]
Well, yes, actually.

189
00:08:52,233 --> 00:08:54,567
But the key word
there is "together"!

190
00:08:56,025 --> 00:08:58,692
Well, since the next Wave
isn't due for another month,

191
00:08:58,775 --> 00:09:00,942
I guess that's the plan.

192
00:09:04,608 --> 00:09:06,525
Let's spend the night
down in Lute Village.

193
00:09:06,608 --> 00:09:07,775
Then tomorrow, after breakfast,

194
00:09:07,858 --> 00:09:09,608
we can go out and
grind some levels.

195
00:09:09,692 --> 00:09:10,983
Sure thing!

196
00:09:14,192 --> 00:09:16,400
[NAOFUMI]
Hey, wake up!

197
00:09:16,483 --> 00:09:17,900
Raphtalia!

198
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:23,150
[RAPHTALIA groans]

199
00:09:30,108 --> 00:09:30,942
Piyo!

200
00:09:31,025 --> 00:09:32,025
[BOTH gasp]

201
00:09:32,108 --> 00:09:34,067
Piyo!

202
00:09:35,608 --> 00:09:36,442
Pi!

203
00:09:36,525 --> 00:09:38,817
It's so cute, Master Naofumi!

204
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:40,692
Pi, pi, pi, pi!

205
00:09:40,775 --> 00:09:43,692
[RAPHTALIA giggles]
It must think you're its mother.

206
00:09:43,775 --> 00:09:46,608
[NAOFUMI]
Yeah. Imprinting, huh?

207
00:09:46,692 --> 00:09:48,567
[RAPHTALIA] We need to
think of a good name for it.

208
00:09:48,650 --> 00:09:50,400
[NAOFUMI]
Oh, boy...

209
00:10:37,067 --> 00:10:40,358
[RAPHTALIA] I can't believe she
grew so much in just two days!

210
00:10:40,442 --> 00:10:43,275
My Growth Boost skill
probably helped a little.

211
00:10:43,358 --> 00:10:44,608
Right, Filo?

212
00:10:44,692 --> 00:10:45,900
Gua.

213
00:10:45,983 --> 00:10:48,650
[RAPHTALIA] You named her
Filo as in "filolial"?

214
00:10:48,733 --> 00:10:50,025
Um...

215
00:10:50,108 --> 00:10:52,442
Don't you think that's
a little bit obvious?

216
00:10:52,525 --> 00:10:54,567
Yeah, but she seems
to really like it.

217
00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:56,483
Gua!

218
00:10:56,567 --> 00:10:58,233
[VILLAGER 5A]
Hey, look at that.

219
00:10:58,317 --> 00:11:00,233
[VILLAGER 5B]
Why are the knights here?

220
00:11:00,317 --> 00:11:01,650
Huh?

221
00:11:01,733 --> 00:11:04,067
[MYNE] In light of his
exploits during the last Wave,

222
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:06,025
the Spear Hero, Sir Motoyasu,

223
00:11:06,108 --> 00:11:08,733
has been appointed ruling
lord of this region.

224
00:11:08,817 --> 00:11:12,025
[VILLAGERS murmuring]

225
00:11:12,108 --> 00:11:15,442
To help the rebuilding efforts,
we've decided to levy a toll.

226
00:11:15,525 --> 00:11:18,233
This toll will be 50 silvers
to enter the village

227
00:11:18,317 --> 00:11:19,650
and 50 to exit.

228
00:11:19,733 --> 00:11:21,358
But that'll ruin us!

229
00:11:21,442 --> 00:11:23,858
We won't have anything left
to buy food tomorrow!

230
00:11:23,942 --> 00:11:26,483
Do you dare to defy
your lord's orders?

231
00:11:26,567 --> 00:11:27,817
[NAOFUMI]
Yep, you bet!

232
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:28,983
[MYNE, VILLAGERS gasp]

233
00:11:29,067 --> 00:11:30,567
[MYNE]
Ugh, the Shield Hero?

234
00:11:30,650 --> 00:11:32,817
What are you still doing here?

235
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:35,150
This is Sir Motoyasu's
domain now.

236
00:11:35,233 --> 00:11:37,025
You have no right
to question him.

237
00:11:37,108 --> 00:11:40,525
Actually, leave this instant,
you miserable criminal!

238
00:11:40,608 --> 00:11:43,150
[groans] Oh, don't worry,
I'm glad to leave.

239
00:11:43,233 --> 00:11:44,650
But, you know,

240
00:11:44,733 --> 00:11:46,775
I don't think the villagers
will be too happy about it.

241
00:11:46,858 --> 00:11:47,858
Motoyasu!

242
00:11:47,942 --> 00:11:49,442
You have any idea
how much it costs

243
00:11:49,525 --> 00:11:51,025
to spend a night
at the inn here?

244
00:11:51,108 --> 00:11:53,525
Huh? Actually, um...

245
00:11:53,608 --> 00:11:56,067
One silver a night,
with food included.

246
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:58,400
You're charging the
equivalent of a hundred nights

247
00:11:58,483 --> 00:12:01,233
just to enter and exit the
village, do you realize that?

248
00:12:01,317 --> 00:12:02,233
[VILLAGER 5A]
Yeah, yeah!

249
00:12:02,317 --> 00:12:03,775
[VILLAGER 5B]
He's right!

250
00:12:03,858 --> 00:12:05,817
And you can't just show up here
and call yourself our lord.

251
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:08,192
And it was the Shield Hero who
defended this whole village

252
00:12:08,275 --> 00:12:09,817
when the Wave of
Catastrophe hit!

253
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:13,317
You dare complain
about a royal decree?!

254
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,025
[VILLAGERS gasp]

255
00:12:15,108 --> 00:12:17,317
I suggest you all knock it off!

257
00:12:21,525 --> 00:12:24,900
I trust you know who we
represent, Princess Malty.

258
00:12:24,983 --> 00:12:26,775
But why have you come?

259
00:12:28,233 --> 00:12:29,983
For you.

260
00:12:30,067 --> 00:12:32,650
Master Naofumi, who are they?

261
00:12:32,733 --> 00:12:35,108
I haven't a clue, but they're
important, that's for sure.

262
00:12:35,192 --> 00:12:39,150
How could this be?! [groans]

263
00:12:39,233 --> 00:12:41,108
Shield Hero!

264
00:12:41,192 --> 00:12:43,483
Fight us for the right
to rule this village.

265
00:12:43,567 --> 00:12:44,983
[RAPHTALIA, NAOFUMI]
Huh?

266
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:47,650
I decline!

267
00:12:47,733 --> 00:12:49,983
But sir, if you
refuse this challenge,

268
00:12:50,067 --> 00:12:53,108
the village will fall into
the Spear Hero's hands!

269
00:12:53,192 --> 00:12:56,608
Though it pains me to admit it,
not even I, as the lord,

270
00:12:56,692 --> 00:12:58,733
can accept further taxation!

271
00:12:58,817 --> 00:13:01,192
But why do I have to
ride in a dragon race?

272
00:13:01,275 --> 00:13:04,150
Sounds like nothin' but
a pain in the butt.

273
00:13:04,233 --> 00:13:06,942
But they've specifically
asked for you, Shield Hero.

274
00:13:07,025 --> 00:13:08,775
As a result, we don't
have any right

275
00:13:08,858 --> 00:13:10,442
to challenge a Cardinal Hero.

276
00:13:10,525 --> 00:13:11,525
Know what I think?

277
00:13:11,608 --> 00:13:13,108
I'd bet anything
it was that message

00:13:13,192 --> 00:13:15,108
that bent Myne out of shape.

[NAOFUMI]
What's her problem?

285
00:13:28,608 --> 00:13:31,233
It sure looks like it's true
that filolials and dragons

286

don't get along
very well together.

We'll give you a huge reward for
winning if you accept for us!

I just can't make any
guarantees that I'll win.

[MOTOYASU]
That is so lame.

You're gonna ride that
bird thing? Not a dragon?

How can you possibly keep up
with my dragon with that thing?

will come in handy.

[FILO groans]

475
00:21:44,942 --> 00:21:46,067
[gasps]

476
00:21:47,150 --> 00:21:48,400
[NAOFUMI]
Huh?

477
00:21:51,650 --> 00:21:53,650
[FILO groans]

00:21:57,067 --> 00:21:59,108
That--That girl is--

00:22:04,483 --> 00:22:06,275
Master, hi!

00:22:06,358 --> 00:22:07,942
Good morning!

00:22:11,275 --> 00:22:12,567
How would I know?!

485
00:22:12,650 --> 00:22:13,650
[FILO]
Huh?

486
00:22:13,733 --> 00:22:16,150
Can I have something to eat?
