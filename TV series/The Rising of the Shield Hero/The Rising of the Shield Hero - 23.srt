00:07:51,567 --> 00:07:53,525
Decipher the meaning
of this message

162
00:07:53,608 --> 00:07:56,108
and energize the
target of my choice.

163
00:07:56,192 --> 00:07:58,150
Casting Zweit Aura.

164
00:07:58,233 --> 00:08:02,192
[FILO gasps]
Oh I feel... powerful.

165
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,567
[FILO]
Nailed it!

166
00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:13,192
So a hero of the past
left this here, huh?

167
00:08:13,275 --> 00:08:15,817
Well, I guess that means
the legend is true.

168
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:18,400
[L'ARC]
Hey! Shield Kiddo!

169
00:08:18,483 --> 00:08:21,067
Filo sure did get some
good height on that one.

170
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:22,942
It helped us figure
out where you were.

171
00:08:23,025 --> 00:08:24,150
[FILO giggles]

172
00:08:24,233 --> 00:08:26,025
You know, you kinda
hurt my feelings

173
00:08:26,108 --> 00:08:28,275
getting off the boat
without saying goodbye.

174
00:08:28,358 --> 00:08:30,733
[NAOFUMI]
I didn't realize I needed to.

175
00:08:30,817 --> 00:08:32,983
[L'ARC] Company can
make or break a trip.

176
00:08:33,067 --> 00:08:34,525
Besides, you never answered us

177
00:08:34,608 --> 00:08:36,567
when we asked if you
wanted to team up.

178
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:38,942
Obviously, we've
only just arrived,

179
00:08:39,025 --> 00:08:41,442
so first of all we'll need
to get our bearings here,

180
00:08:41,525 --> 00:08:43,400
but we could help
each other out.

181
00:08:43,483 --> 00:08:45,567
[NAOFUMI] Seems like they
know their way around a fight.

182
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:47,358
I guess it can't hurt.

183
00:08:47,442 --> 00:08:48,775
We'll give it a shot,

184
00:08:48,858 --> 00:08:51,025
but I'll drop you in a
heartbeat if you hold us back.

185
00:08:51,108 --> 00:08:54,150
[L'ARC laughs]
Right back at ya, kiddo.

186
00:08:54,233 --> 00:08:55,817
We'll catch up with you later.

187
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:57,567
Take it easy till then.

188
00:08:58,608 --> 00:09:00,025
I'm a little surprised.

189
00:09:00,108 --> 00:09:00,858
[NAOFUMI]
Hm?

190
00:09:00,942 --> 00:09:02,067
I was sure you'd think that

191
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:04,525
somebody like L'Arc was
too hard to deal with.

192
00:09:04,608 --> 00:09:05,858
I wouldn't say that.

193
00:09:05,942 --> 00:09:08,358
It's just that he throws
me off a little bit.

194
00:09:08,442 --> 00:09:09,692
[RAPHTALIA, FILO giggle]

195
00:09:09,775 --> 00:09:11,150
[NAOFUMI]
It's already after noon.

196
00:09:11,233 --> 00:09:13,983
We don't have much time,
but let's go grind some levels.

197
00:09:14,067 --> 00:09:15,358
--[FILO] Okay!
--[RAPHTALIA] Right!

198
00:09:19,483 --> 00:09:20,775
[RAPHTALIA grunts]

199
00:09:20,858 --> 00:09:21,942
[FILO grunts]

200
00:09:23,983 --> 00:09:27,942
Even one-shotting trash mobs'll
give you that much experience?

201
00:09:28,025 --> 00:09:31,025
And even better,
there's an infinite respawn.

202
00:09:38,942 --> 00:09:40,025
They're so weak,

203
00:09:40,108 --> 00:09:42,067
it's hard not to get
bored fighting them.

204
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:42,900
[NAOFUMI]
Hm?

205
00:09:42,983 --> 00:09:44,733
Is everything all right?

206
00:09:44,817 --> 00:09:48,025
[NAOFUMI] We stopped
gaining experience points.

207
00:09:48,108 --> 00:09:49,275
[ALL gasp]

208
00:09:49,358 --> 00:09:51,317
[ITSUKI]
So you're responsible.

209
00:09:53,525 --> 00:09:54,775
Itsuki...

210
00:09:54,858 --> 00:09:56,942
[MOTOYASU]
What happened to my EXP?

211
00:09:57,025 --> 00:09:58,233
[MYNE, MOTOYASU groan]

212
00:09:58,317 --> 00:10:00,942
[REN] Hey, what are
you guys doing here?

213
00:10:01,025 --> 00:10:03,483
I can't farm any EXP like this.

214
00:10:03,567 --> 00:10:04,983
Go somewhere else.

215
00:10:05,067 --> 00:10:07,233
Oh, no. Why don't you go?

216
00:10:07,317 --> 00:10:09,692
You're gonna have to
leave, too, Motoyasu.

217
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:11,858
You know that I was the
first one to find this spot.

218
00:10:11,942 --> 00:10:12,942
[MOTOYASU]
No, I was!

219
00:10:13,025 --> 00:10:14,608
--[REN] It was me.
--[ITSUKI] No, me!

220
00:10:14,692 --> 00:10:16,817
--[MOTOYASU] I found it first!
--Well, this is a waste of time.

221
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:18,317
We're outta here.

222
00:10:27,358 --> 00:10:29,233
[roars]

223
00:10:29,317 --> 00:10:30,775
[NAOFUMI grunts]

224
00:10:30,858 --> 00:10:33,233
You're going down!

225
00:10:38,317 --> 00:10:41,567
[NAOFUMI] That's a lot,
even for a boss fight like that.

226
00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:43,358
I like this island a lot better

227
00:10:43,442 --> 00:10:45,858
'cause fighting stuff here
is so much more fun!

228
00:10:45,942 --> 00:10:47,817
Master Naofumi.

229
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:50,525
I don't know how much longer
this sword will last.

230
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:52,608
[NAOFUMI]
When did that happen?

231
00:10:52,692 --> 00:10:53,858
[RAPHTALIA]
Maybe our power levels

232
00:10:53,942 --> 00:10:56,025
have outgrown our
weapons' durability.

233
00:10:56,108 --> 00:10:57,900
[NAOFUMI]
Yeah, look at Filo's.

234
00:10:57,983 --> 00:10:59,067
[FILO]
Hm?

235
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:00,858
We'll just have to
make sure to buy you two

236
00:11:00,942 --> 00:11:03,775
some new weapons before
the next Wave hits.

237
00:11:03,858 --> 00:11:05,275
Uh-huh.

238
00:11:05,358 --> 00:11:08,025
C'mon, we've still
got plenty of time.

239
00:11:08,108 --> 00:11:11,483
All right! Let's see if
we got any good drops.

240
00:11:15,650 --> 00:11:16,692
Huh?

241
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:24,400
There we are.

242
00:11:24,483 --> 00:11:26,233
Those should keep you goin'
for a little longer.

243
00:11:26,317 --> 00:11:28,025
This is perfect, thank you!

244
00:11:28,108 --> 00:11:30,817
Yeah, Master. Thanks a lot!

245
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:32,983
[RAPHTALIA]
It's starting to get dark.

246
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:34,650
Do you want to head back?

247
00:11:34,733 --> 00:11:37,108
[NAOFUMI]
Nah, not just yet.

248
00:11:41,317 --> 00:11:42,317
[NAOFUMI]
I had a feeling we'd get

249
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:45,192
some better drops
after nightfall.

250
00:11:45,275 --> 00:11:47,692
Enemies are a lot
stronger, though.

251
00:11:47,775 --> 00:11:49,317
But we're used to
fighting in the dark,

252
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:51,942
so we can handle whatever
we come up against.

253
00:11:52,025 --> 00:11:54,650
--But, what really worries me...
--Huh?

254
00:11:54,733 --> 00:11:59,317
Master Naofumi, you still
look awfully tired. Are you?

255
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,692
So it's obvious.

256
00:12:00,775 --> 00:12:02,233
Since using Blood Sacrifice,

257
00:12:02,317 --> 00:12:04,275
my body's still
feeling the curse.

258
00:12:04,358 --> 00:12:05,608
Just a little.

259
00:12:06,650 --> 00:12:08,483
It's nothing to worry about.

260
00:12:08,567 --> 00:12:09,817
I'm not gonna push it.

261
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:11,858
And I can handle the
enemies on this island.

262
00:12:11,942 --> 00:12:12,692
[rustling]

263
00:12:12,775 --> 00:12:13,733
Huh?

264
00:12:21,108 --> 00:12:22,775
[ALL gasp]

265
00:12:22,858 --> 00:12:25,733
Oh, thank goodness,
we found ya, kiddo.

266
00:12:25,817 --> 00:12:28,317
Why are you out here in
the middle of the night?

267
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:29,942
[THERESE] The ferryman
was starting to panic

268
00:12:30,025 --> 00:12:32,233
since you were
staying out so late.

269
00:12:32,317 --> 00:12:34,483
So you two decided
to come look for us?

270
00:12:34,567 --> 00:12:36,817
C'mon, It's not like
adventurers dying on a quest

271
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:37,983
is anything new.

272
00:12:38,067 --> 00:12:39,442
That doesn't mean we're
gonna ignore you,

273
00:12:39,525 --> 00:12:41,025
'cause I'd never be
able to sleep at night

274
00:12:41,108 --> 00:12:43,608
if my associates were to
turn up dead or missing.

275
00:12:43,692 --> 00:12:45,108
[NAOFUMI]
"Associates"?

276
00:12:45,192 --> 00:12:46,108
Well, yeah!

277
00:12:46,192 --> 00:12:47,233
What would you call us?

278
00:12:47,317 --> 00:12:49,358
You wouldn't say
we're not, would you?

279
00:12:49,442 --> 00:12:50,608
[NAOFUMI]
Well...

280
00:12:50,692 --> 00:12:52,858
We haven't even
been here a full day.

281
00:12:52,942 --> 00:12:55,692
I understand wanting to
grind as fast as possible,

282
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:57,192
but let's call it a night.

283
00:12:57,275 --> 00:13:00,192
She's right, Master Naofumi,
it is getting late.

284
00:13:00,275 --> 00:13:01,942
Raphtalia?

285
00:13:02,025 --> 00:13:04,108
All right then. Let's head back.

286
00:13:04,192 --> 00:13:07,067
[L'ARC]
Very well. In that case...

287
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:09,442
D'ya care to join
me for a drink?

288
00:13:09,525 --> 00:13:11,483
[NAOFUMI sighs]

289
00:13:11,567 --> 00:13:16,150
[PATRONS chattering]

290
00:13:16,233 --> 00:13:19,525
[L'ARC]
To our safe return! Cheers!

291
00:13:22,525 --> 00:13:23,358
[laughs]

292
00:13:23,442 --> 00:13:25,358
Hey barkeeper, gimme another!

293
00:13:25,442 --> 00:13:26,400
[OWNER 23A]
Coming!

294
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,567
[PATRONS gasping]

295
00:14:24,650 --> 00:14:27,233
[MYNE]
Oh! Sir Motoyasu!

296
00:14:28,692 --> 00:14:30,983
[NAOFUMI] I didn't know
they made wine out of these.

297
00:14:31,067 --> 00:14:33,483
They're so strong that you have
to dilute just one of 'em

298
00:14:33,567 --> 00:14:35,525
in a cask of water to get
something drinkable.

299
00:14:35,608 --> 00:14:37,483
Pretty tasty just
the way they are.

300
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:40,067
Saying you can hold your
liquor's an understatement.

301
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:41,150
[NAOFUMI]
Hm?

302
00:14:47,192 --> 00:14:48,358
[NAOFUMI]
I never thought there'd be a day

303
00:14:48,442 --> 00:14:51,317
when I could just relax
and have fun like this.

304
00:14:52,942 --> 00:14:54,525
[THERESE]
I'm looking forward to this.

305
00:14:54,608 --> 00:14:55,775
I am, too.

306
00:14:55,858 --> 00:14:57,067
Oh, and Therese,

307
00:14:57,150 --> 00:14:58,817
the accessory you
asked for, it's ready.

308
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:02,067
[THERESE gasps]
Thank you so much!

309
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:04,317
[NAOFUMI] I can't believe
you had a starfire.

310
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,983
Those things are rare.

311
00:15:06,067 --> 00:15:08,525
It helped that I already had
an oracle crystal on hand

312
00:15:08,608 --> 00:15:11,525
that I used as the base of
the whole thing... Huh?

313
00:15:14,275 --> 00:15:15,608
[ALL gasp]

314
00:15:15,692 --> 00:15:16,525
[THERESE]
It's beautiful.

315
00:15:16,608 --> 00:15:17,650
Huh?

316
00:15:17,733 --> 00:15:20,317
This jewel's filled
with so much joy.

317
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:23,483
I didn't know you were
such a master craftsman.

318
00:15:23,567 --> 00:15:25,608
Uh, do you have to cry about it?

319
00:15:25,692 --> 00:15:27,317
Don't you understand, L'Arc?

320
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:28,608
Looking at this masterpiece

321
00:15:28,692 --> 00:15:30,817
is opening up a whole
new world to me!

322
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:32,525
Um, okay...

323
00:15:32,608 --> 00:15:35,775
All right. I'm really glad to
hear that you're happy with it.

324
00:15:35,858 --> 00:15:38,775
Oh, and I hate to mention
the money, but, uh...

325
00:15:38,858 --> 00:15:40,483
[gasps]

326
00:15:40,567 --> 00:15:42,942
[NAOFUMI]
Whoa... This is a lot...

327
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:44,233
Not enough, though, right?

328
00:15:44,317 --> 00:15:46,775
I know this is worth
so much more than that.

329
00:15:46,858 --> 00:15:49,733
Hey, L'Arc, give him all
the money that you have, too!

330
00:15:49,817 --> 00:15:50,817
Wait, wha?

331
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:52,567
[THERESE]
Just do it already, okay?

332
00:15:52,650 --> 00:15:53,650
[L'ARC]
Why?

333
00:15:53,733 --> 00:15:55,567
You can just pay me
in installments.

334
00:15:55,650 --> 00:15:57,608
Now let's go grind some levels.

335
00:15:58,942 --> 00:16:01,900
[L'ARC] Your party is pretty
high-level. Not bad, kiddo.

336
00:16:01,983 --> 00:16:04,192
Therese has reached
Level 52 herself,

337
00:16:04,275 --> 00:16:05,858
and I'm up to 56.

338
00:16:05,942 --> 00:16:08,108
[NAOFUMI] Already got
their class upgrades.

339
00:16:08,192 --> 00:16:10,650
Not your everyday
adventurers, then.

340
00:16:13,817 --> 00:16:15,983
How about we discuss
our strategy?

341
00:16:16,067 --> 00:16:17,900
[rustling]

342

[ALL squawking]

343
00:16:19,858 --> 00:16:22,650
We can do that and fight!

344
00:16:24,067 --> 00:16:25,108
[NAOFUMI grunts]

345
00:16:25,192 --> 00:16:26,483
The shield's your weapon?

346
00:16:26,567 --> 00:16:28,317
Committed to that
"Sir Hero" act, huh?

347
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,608
Keep talkin'.

348
00:16:29,692 --> 00:16:31,650
Raphtalia! Filo!

349
00:16:31,733 --> 00:16:33,150
[NAOFUMI gasps]

[yells]

351
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:40,900
Oh, L'Arc.
He's certainly having fun.

352
00:16:41,942 --> 00:16:43,817
Power of jewels far and wide,

353
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:46,942
I beseech thee to heed
my call and come to me.

354
00:16:47,025 --> 00:16:49,650
My name is Therese Alexanderite.

355
00:16:49,733 --> 00:16:53,608
I ask my friends to be the
force that destroys my targets!

356
00:16:53,692 --> 00:16:56,400
Bejeweled Ruby Blaze!

357
00:17:02,483 --> 00:17:04,775
I've never heard
a chant like that.

358
00:17:04,858 --> 00:17:06,025
[NAOFUMI]
Raphtalia!

359
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:07,692
[gasps] On it!

360
00:17:09,942 --> 00:17:12,983
I never dreamed it
would be so powerful.

361
00:17:21,192 --> 00:17:24,983
The EXP curve slowed down a lot
as soon as we hit Level 70.

362
00:17:25,067 --> 00:17:27,858
Okay. Let's go after
the big fella, then.

363
00:17:27,942 --> 00:17:30,358
[ALL squawking]

364
00:17:30,442 --> 00:17:32,358
The boss by itself
wouldn't be a big deal,

365
00:17:32,442 --> 00:17:34,400
but all these tiny
guys'll be a pain.

366
00:17:34,483 --> 00:17:36,275
Just leave the
little ones to me.

367
00:17:36,358 --> 00:17:37,650
I'll gather 'em all up.

368
00:17:37,733 --> 00:17:38,983
And then?

369
00:17:39,067 --> 00:17:40,650
I'll take them out once
he's got their attention.

370
00:17:40,733 --> 00:17:43,400
L'Arc, Filo, and Raphtalia
can attack the boss.

371
00:17:43,483 --> 00:17:44,900
Sounds good to me.

372
00:17:44,983 --> 00:17:46,442
Everyone ready?

373
00:17:46,525 --> 00:17:47,692
Let's go!

374
00:17:49,442 --> 00:17:51,483

--[RAPHTALIA gasps]
--Master, no!

381
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:17,567
Now just relax.

382
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:24,942
[NAOFUMI] The flames are all
around me, but I don't feel hot.

383
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,525
[NAOFUMI]
Not only am I not taking damage,

384
00:18:31,608 --> 00:18:35,150
it feels like the weight of
the curse has been lifted.

385
00:18:35,233 --> 00:18:36,942
[NAOFUMI]
Just the big one left!

386
00:18:37,025 --> 00:18:37,775
All right!

387
00:18:37,858 --> 00:18:39,358
We got this!

388
00:18:41,942 --> 00:18:44,108
[FILO] Are you sure
you're okay, Master?

389
00:18:44,192 --> 00:18:45,108
Yeah.

390
00:18:45,192 --> 00:18:47,317
What a strange magic spell.

391
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,900
My clothes aren't even singed.

392
00:18:48,983 --> 00:18:50,275
Very strange.

393
00:18:50,358 --> 00:18:52,358
I've never even heard
that chant before.

394
00:18:52,442 --> 00:18:56,317
Guess there's more than one kind
of magic in this world, huh?

395
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:59,025
Hey, you wanna
divvy up the drops?

396
00:18:59,108 --> 00:19:01,775
Sure. We get anything good?

397
00:19:01,858 --> 00:19:04,150
Well, there's some
kind of weird item.

398
00:19:04,233 --> 00:19:05,067
[L'ARC]
"Weird"?

399
00:19:05,150 --> 00:19:06,858
See for yourself.

400
00:19:06,942 --> 00:19:08,650
[L'ARC]
The heck is that?

401
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:11,733
With your help,

402
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:13,692
we gained a lot of
levels in just one day.

403
00:19:13,775 --> 00:19:15,192
And it was fun!

404
00:19:15,275 --> 00:19:17,400
I couldn't agree
with you more, Filo.

405
00:19:17,483 --> 00:19:19,233
[NAOFUMI] You wanna
team up again tomorrow?

406
00:19:19,317 --> 00:19:20,733
[L'ARC gasps]

407
00:19:20,817 --> 00:19:23,400
I think we'll go it
alone for now.

408
00:19:23,483 --> 00:19:24,608
Okay...

409
00:19:24,692 --> 00:19:26,192
We'll see ya around
though, Shield Kiddo.

410
00:19:26,275 --> 00:19:27,692
Thanks for a great day.

411
00:19:27,775 --> 00:19:30,108
Thank you, too. We worked
really well together.

See ya later!

413
00:19:32,608 --> 00:19:34,358
[RAPHTALIA]
You asked them to stick around.

414
00:19:34,442 --> 00:19:35,650
That's not like you.

415
00:19:35,733 --> 00:19:37,983
I got rejected, though.

416
00:19:38,067 --> 00:19:40,067
[NAOFUMI] Maybe I should
ask them to join my party

417
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:42,483
after we finish leveling up.

418
00:19:42,567 --> 00:19:44,817
Since we worked so hard,
let's take the day off tomorrow.

419
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:46,067
Yeah!

420
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:49,067
Personally, I don't mind
one way or the other.

421
00:19:49,150 --> 00:19:52,317
But you probably could use
a break, Master Naofumi.

422
00:19:56,442 --> 00:19:57,817
[FILO]
Hey, Master!

423
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:58,650
[NAOFUMI]
Hm?

424
00:19:58,733 --> 00:20:00,525
I found another island.

425
00:20:00,608 --> 00:20:02,483
Big deal, there's a
whole bunch of 'em.

426
00:20:02,567 --> 00:20:03,775
No, listen.

427
00:20:03,858 --> 00:20:05,775
I found a special
island underwater,

428
00:20:05,858 --> 00:20:07,400
and it looks like
it's glowing red.

429
00:20:07,483 --> 00:20:09,567
A special island underwater?

430
00:20:09,650 --> 00:20:10,983
That's not all!

431
00:20:11,067 --> 00:20:13,108
And there was a big brick
building down there, too!

432
00:20:13,192 --> 00:20:15,775
We have kinda hit a wall
with our leveling grind.

433
00:20:15,858 --> 00:20:18,525
This could be a nice
change of pace for us.

434
00:20:21,775 --> 00:20:24,108
[RAPHTALIA]
Excuse me, Master Naofumi?

435
00:20:27,317 --> 00:20:29,608
So, uh, what do you think?

436
00:20:29,692 --> 00:20:31,108
[NAOFUMI]
Dressed like that,

437
00:20:31,192 --> 00:20:34,150
it won't matter much if a little
water leaks into the suit.

438
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:35,442
I think it's great!

439
00:20:35,525 --> 00:20:36,775
[gasps]

440
00:20:36,858 --> 00:20:38,567
[NAOFUMI]
All right, let's go!

441
00:20:38,650 --> 00:20:39,900
Okay!

442
00:20:51,483 --> 00:20:53,275
[NAOFUMI]
This is crazy.

443
00:20:53,358 --> 00:20:56,608
Ten minutes underwater
and I can still breathe.

444
00:20:57,817 --> 00:21:00,317
[NAOFUMI]
Building's in perfect condition.

445
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:03,233
There's gotta be a way
inside somewhere.

446
00:21:05,775 --> 00:21:07,192
[NAOFUMI sighs]
It'll be impossible

447
00:21:07,275 --> 00:21:09,483
to open this door underwater.

448
00:21:14,358 --> 00:21:16,192
[NAOFUMI]
There's air inside?

449
00:21:25,317 --> 00:21:27,608
[FILO]
It's too dark to see anything.

450
00:21:27,692 --> 00:21:28,983
[NAOFUMI]
'Kay, Raphtalia?

451
00:21:29,067 --> 00:21:30,692
[RAPHTALIA]
Sure.

452
00:21:30,775 --> 00:21:32,775
Give me First Light.

453
00:21:37,692 --> 00:21:38,858
[NAOFUMI gasps]

454
00:21:41,483 --> 00:21:44,567
[NAOFUMI] No way!
That's a dragon hourglass!

455
00:21:44,650 --> 00:21:46,400
It looks exactly like
the one they've got

456
00:21:46,483 --> 00:21:49,233
inside the cathedral
back at the capital.

457
00:21:49,317 --> 00:21:50,650
Is that bad?

458
00:21:50,733 --> 00:21:53,025
Anywhere there's an hourglass
can be hit by a Wave.

459
00:21:53,108 --> 00:21:54,567
[FILO, RAPHTALIA gasp]

460
00:21:54,650 --> 00:21:56,942
If a Wave attacks this place,
the islanders will all die!

461
00:21:57,025 --> 00:21:58,150
Stay calm.

462
00:21:58,233 --> 00:22:00,150
We don't know that's
gonna happen for sure.

463
00:22:00,233 --> 00:22:01,817
Okay...

464
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:02,817
[NAOFUMI]
Hm?

465
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:12,733
This says the next
Wave is coming...

466
00:22:12,817 --> 00:22:14,858
...in just two days!
