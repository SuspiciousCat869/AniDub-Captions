00:00:40,733 --> 00:00:42,192
[gasps]

2
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:45,983
[NAOFUMI groans]

3
00:00:47,317 --> 00:00:48,608
[NAOFUMI]
Hm?

4
00:00:50,108 --> 00:00:52,858
Anybody care to tell me
what's goin' on here?

5
00:00:52,942 --> 00:00:54,275
[ALL gasp]

6
00:00:54,358 --> 00:00:55,858
Master Naofumi!

7
00:00:55,942 --> 00:00:58,817
Yay! [giggles]

8
00:00:58,900 --> 00:00:59,858
[MELTY]
Finally!

9
00:00:59,942 --> 00:01:02,317
Why'd you have to sleep so long?

10
00:01:03,775 --> 00:01:05,483
[NAOFUMI]
What happened?

11
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:13,525
[NAOFUMI]
After we defeated the Pope,

12
00:01:13,608 --> 00:01:15,983
I must've lost consciousness...

13
00:01:16,067 --> 00:01:18,942
So they brought me to the
royal family's private clinic

14
00:01:19,025 --> 00:01:21,983
where I guess I've been
asleep for three days.

15
00:01:22,067 --> 00:01:23,567
According to Raphtalia,

16
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:26,900
the queen did everything in
her power to save my life.

17
00:01:30,442 --> 00:01:32,775
[NAOFUMI]
I'm stuck here for a month?

18
00:01:32,858 --> 00:01:34,733
But my wounds are
completely gone,

19
00:01:34,817 --> 00:01:36,942
thanks to that healing magic.

20
00:01:37,025 --> 00:01:39,233
[RAPHTALIA]
The curse was powerful.

21
00:01:39,317 --> 00:01:42,858
Time is the only treatment
for the damage it did to you.

22
00:01:42,942 --> 00:01:44,567
[NAOFUMI]
The Wrath Shield...

23
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:47,067
Blood Sacrifice...

24
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:48,942
"Powerful" is right.

25
00:01:49,025 --> 00:01:52,442
But my body gets destroyed
along with my target.

26
00:01:53,692 --> 00:01:56,150
[NAOFUMI] It probably would've
hurt the rest of you, too,

27
00:01:56,233 --> 00:01:57,900
if it weren't for Fitoria.

28
00:01:57,983 --> 00:01:59,900
--[footsteps]
--[NAOFUMI] Hm?

29
00:01:59,983 --> 00:02:02,483
We're here to change
your bandages, I daresay.

30
00:02:02,567 --> 00:02:03,400
[ALL gasp]

31
00:02:03,483 --> 00:02:04,733
"Daresay"?

32
00:02:04,817 --> 00:02:08,400
Another medic did it
just a few minutes ago.

33
00:02:08,483 --> 00:02:11,400
[NAOFUMI] These two aren't
medics. They're Shadows.

34
00:02:11,483 --> 00:02:13,108
--[MELTY gasps]
--[FILO] Huh?

35
00:02:13,192 --> 00:02:16,442
[MIRELIA] I rushed over as soon
as they told me you'd awakened.

36
00:02:16,525 --> 00:02:17,900
[BOTH gasp]

37
00:02:17,983 --> 00:02:19,483
[MIRELIA]
I'm relieved that your life is

38
00:02:19,567 --> 00:02:21,525
no longer in danger.

39
00:02:21,608 --> 00:02:24,942
It's Mother--uh, Your Majesty!

40
00:02:25,025 --> 00:02:27,358
[MIRELIA] Allow me to
re-introduce myself.

41
00:02:27,442 --> 00:02:29,692
You were a bit
indisposed last time.

42
00:02:29,775 --> 00:02:32,442
I am Queen Mirelia Q. Melromarc.

43
00:02:32,525 --> 00:02:34,983
You saved Master
Naofumi's life and...

44
00:02:35,067 --> 00:02:36,608
...I don't know
how to thank you.

45
00:02:36,692 --> 00:02:39,650
Well, I could hardly allow
him to die, now could I?

46
00:02:39,733 --> 00:02:42,483
The Shield Hero's one of
the Four Cardinal Heroes.

47
00:02:42,567 --> 00:02:46,025
He helps to keep the world safe
from the Waves of Catastrophe.

48
00:02:46,108 --> 00:02:47,192
[NAOFUMI]
That's funny.

49
00:02:47,275 --> 00:02:48,358
Because this country of yours

50
00:02:48,442 --> 00:02:50,858
doesn't seem to
appreciate the Shield.

51
00:02:50,942 --> 00:02:54,233
Ever since I got here, they've
blamed me for everything.

52
00:02:54,317 --> 00:02:56,233
[RAPHTALIA]
Master Naofumi...

53
00:02:56,317 --> 00:02:58,650
[MIRELIA]
I owe you an explanation.

54
00:03:00,567 --> 00:03:02,400
[MIRELIA]
I was far away from Melromarc

55
00:03:02,483 --> 00:03:05,108
at an international forum
with the other world leaders

56
00:03:05,192 --> 00:03:08,108
to determine how best to fight
against the upcoming Waves

57
00:03:08,192 --> 00:03:10,192
when things took a turn.

58
00:03:10,275 --> 00:03:13,317
At this forum, we decided
that the major nations

59
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,358
would each summon one hero.

60
00:03:15,442 --> 00:03:17,733
Then all four of us would
be able to work together

61
00:03:17,817 --> 00:03:18,733
to fight the Waves.

62
00:03:18,817 --> 00:03:20,150
[gasps]

63
00:03:20,233 --> 00:03:22,233
[MIRELIA] But by the time
we'd made that decision,

64
00:03:22,317 --> 00:03:24,025
Melromarc's temporary leadership

65
00:03:24,108 --> 00:03:28,067
had already summoned
all four Cardinal Heroes.

66
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:30,567
This made the other
nations furious,

67
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:33,775
which forced me to travel the
world to put out the fires.

68
00:03:33,858 --> 00:03:36,192
You're saying that trash
king and bitchy princess

69
00:03:36,275 --> 00:03:38,400
summoned us here
all on their own?

70
00:03:39,442 --> 00:03:40,775
They weren't even
supposed to have

71
00:03:40,858 --> 00:03:42,567
the power to make that decision.

72
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:44,442
I did my best to
keep them on a leash

73
00:03:44,525 --> 00:03:47,192
by leaving a lord I trusted
in control of the kingdom

74
00:03:47,275 --> 00:03:48,567
while I was away.

75
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:49,817
However...

76
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:52,108
He was tragically killed
during the first Wave

77
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:54,525
and Her Majesty hadn't
returned home yet.

78
00:03:54,608 --> 00:03:56,817
He was the kind and
just lord of Seyaette

79
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:57,900
until that happened.

80
00:03:57,983 --> 00:03:59,608
[RAPHTALIA gasps]

81
00:03:59,692 --> 00:04:01,358
[NAOFUMI]
Seyaette?

82
00:04:02,442 --> 00:04:05,108
That explains a lot.

83
00:04:05,192 --> 00:04:06,525
Hey, Melty.

84
00:04:06,608 --> 00:04:07,817
Huh?

85
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:09,983
[NAOFUMI] What's goin' on?
You're acting weird.

86
00:04:10,067 --> 00:04:12,400
[MELTY gasps] U-Uh--Wh-What
are you talking about?

87
00:04:12,483 --> 00:04:13,983
I'm in the presence
of Her Majesty!

88
00:04:14,067 --> 00:04:15,358
[MIRELIA chuckles]

89
00:04:15,442 --> 00:04:17,608
I'm happy to see you've
made some friends, Melty,

90
00:04:17,692 --> 00:04:19,817
and that you can be
yourself around them.

91
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:21,108
I encourage you to stay

92
00:04:21,192 --> 00:04:23,275
in the Shield Hero's
good graces, Melty.

93
00:04:23,358 --> 00:04:25,442
[MELTY]
Mother!

94
00:04:25,525 --> 00:04:27,025
[NAOFUMI]
So...

95
00:04:27,108 --> 00:04:28,692
Why was the Shield
Hero the only one

96
00:04:28,775 --> 00:04:31,067
who had to go through
all that crap?

97
00:04:33,817 --> 00:04:36,108
Aultcray already
had his own reasons

98
00:04:36,192 --> 00:04:38,108
for despising the Shield Hero.

99
00:04:38,192 --> 00:04:40,692
The Three Heroes Church
took advantage of that

100
00:04:40,775 --> 00:04:42,233
to manipulate him.

101
00:04:42,317 --> 00:04:45,192
[NAOFUMI] So he hated a totally
different Shield Hero?

102
00:04:45,275 --> 00:04:48,483
What the hell does any of
that have to do with me?

103
00:04:48,567 --> 00:04:50,150
[MIRELIA]
And Malty made things worse

104
00:04:50,233 --> 00:04:52,858
by trying to ensnare
you the way she did.

105
00:04:52,942 --> 00:04:54,567
I'm guessing things would've
been a lot different

106
00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:57,525
if I'd been summoned by one of
those other countries, huh?

107
00:04:57,608 --> 00:04:59,608
[MIRELIA]
Yes. Siltvelt, for example,

108
00:04:59,692 --> 00:05:01,483
is ruled by demi-humans.

109
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:04,942
The Shield Hero is worshipped
there, almost like a god.

110
00:05:05,025 --> 00:05:08,733
[NAOFUMI chuckles] So maybe I
should head over to Siltvelt.

111
00:05:08,817 --> 00:05:10,150
If you do decide to leave,

112
00:05:10,233 --> 00:05:12,942
Melromarc has no
right to stop you.

113
00:05:13,025 --> 00:05:14,608
But first...

114
00:05:14,692 --> 00:05:16,192
I promise to clear your name

115
00:05:16,275 --> 00:05:18,483
and end the humiliation
you've suffered.

116
00:05:18,567 --> 00:05:22,025
You have been a pariah in
my kingdom for far too long.

117
00:05:22,108 --> 00:05:24,608
And to reward you for
fighting against the Waves

118
00:05:24,692 --> 00:05:27,525
and eliminating the treasonous
Three Heroes Church,

119
00:05:27,608 --> 00:05:29,442
we'll honor you with
the greatest award

120
00:05:29,525 --> 00:05:31,025
Melromarc has to offer,

121
00:05:31,108 --> 00:05:33,650
along with a bonus
of 500 gold pieces.

122
00:05:33,733 --> 00:05:34,608
[RAPHTALIA, MELTY gasp]

123
00:05:34,692 --> 00:05:36,067
Master Naofumi!

124
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:38,067
[FILO]
Hmm. Will 500 gold pieces

125
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:39,817
buy lots of food for me to eat?

126
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:41,108
[MELTY]
It sure will!

127
00:05:41,192 --> 00:05:43,817
[FILO giggles]
Hooray! I can't wait!

128
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:46,108
Lastly, there's something
I'd like to discuss with you

129
00:05:46,192 --> 00:05:47,983
in private, if you don't mind.

130
00:05:48,067 --> 00:05:50,733
[MELTY gasps]
Hey, Raphtalia? Filo?

131
00:05:50,817 --> 00:05:52,650
How about we head back inside?

132
00:05:52,733 --> 00:05:53,775
Oh, okay.

133
00:05:53,858 --> 00:05:56,817
Good! 'Cause I'm hungry!

134
00:05:58,067 --> 00:05:59,525
[MIRELIA]
Isn't it enough?

135
00:05:59,608 --> 00:06:03,567
I just know there's a catch
you haven't told me about yet.

136
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:05,108
At this point,
without your help,

137
00:06:05,192 --> 00:06:08,692
Melromarc has no hope of
surviving our uncertain future.

138
00:06:08,775 --> 00:06:11,067
[NAOFUMI] You can't convince
me to stay in this country.

139
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:12,317
[gasps]

140
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,608
From now on, I'm going
wherever the Waves are,

141
00:06:14,692 --> 00:06:16,650
so I can fight them off.

142
00:06:16,733 --> 00:06:18,067
[NAOFUMI]
That's the best chance I've got

143
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:20,650
to earn myself a
ticket back home.

144
00:06:21,692 --> 00:06:23,025
[MIRELIA]
I understand.

145
00:06:23,108 --> 00:06:24,608
Forgive me for asking.

146
00:06:24,692 --> 00:06:25,942
How's your recovery coming?

147
00:06:26,025 --> 00:06:27,442
[NAOFUMI]
Hm?

148
00:06:27,525 --> 00:06:30,483
Well, at the very least,
I'm back on my feet again.

149
00:06:30,567 --> 00:06:31,817
Excellent.

150
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:33,483
Would you consider a visit
to the castle tomorrow

151
00:06:33,567 --> 00:06:34,525
before you go?

152
00:06:34,608 --> 00:06:36,108
What for?

153
00:06:36,192 --> 00:06:38,317
[MIRELIA] It will give you the
opportunity to clear your name

154
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,733
before the public.

155
00:06:39,817 --> 00:06:43,608
Besides, King Aultcray and
Princess Malty need to...

156
00:06:47,358 --> 00:06:48,483
[MIRELIA]
Aside from myself,

157
00:06:48,567 --> 00:06:50,775
you are the only one
who knows about this.

158
00:06:50,858 --> 00:06:52,358
And regardless of
whether you choose

159
00:06:52,442 --> 00:06:53,900
to work with our country or not,

160
00:06:53,983 --> 00:06:56,108
that won't change
what's going to happen.

161
00:06:56,192 --> 00:06:57,900
This is Melromarc's way of--

162
00:06:57,983 --> 00:07:01,942
No, it's my way of making
things right again.

163
00:07:02,025 --> 00:07:02,858
[NAOFUMI]
But you're talking about

164
00:07:02,942 --> 00:07:05,442
your husband and daughter...

165
00:07:05,525 --> 00:07:07,150
[MIRELIA]
There are consequences.

166
00:07:07,233 --> 00:07:08,567
Their sins are grave enough

167
00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:12,067
that not even the
queen can save them.

168
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:13,942
The people know an
important announcement

169
00:07:14,025 --> 00:07:15,442
will be made tomorrow,

170
00:07:15,525 --> 00:07:17,817
and they've been instructed
to gather outside the castle

171
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:19,983
if they wish to
hear it firsthand.

172
00:07:20,067 --> 00:07:21,525
And I have to be honest,

173
00:07:21,608 --> 00:07:24,567
your presence would be
useful, if not essential.

174
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:27,692
Of course, I understand it's
hardly adequate recompense

175
00:07:27,775 --> 00:07:31,358
for the way you've
been treated, but please.

176
00:07:34,233 --> 00:07:35,275
[FILO]
See?

177
00:07:35,358 --> 00:07:36,692
That's fun!

178
00:07:36,775 --> 00:07:40,067
Master taught me how to
do this. Isn't it great?

179
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:42,817
What was it the queen wanted
to talk to you about?

180
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:44,608
Nothing too important.

181
00:07:44,692 --> 00:07:46,442
She asked me to come
to the castle tomorrow

182
00:07:46,525 --> 00:07:48,608
so she can clear my name
in front of everyone.

183
00:07:48,692 --> 00:07:50,525
[gasps] That's fantastic!

184
00:07:50,608 --> 00:07:51,900
Uh, yeah...

185
00:07:51,983 --> 00:07:53,108
Thank goodness!

186
00:07:53,192 --> 00:07:54,983
This means that
everyone in Melromarc

187
00:07:55,067 --> 00:07:56,358
will finally know the truth--

188
00:07:56,442 --> 00:07:58,608
that you didn't
do anything wrong!

189
00:07:58,692 --> 00:08:00,400
[FILO]
Huh?

190
00:08:00,483 --> 00:08:02,442
[RAPHTALIA]
I'm so relieved!

191
00:08:07,067 --> 00:08:09,400
[CITIZENS yelling]

192
00:08:09,483 --> 00:08:11,192
[gasps]

193
00:08:15,108 --> 00:08:17,900
[NAOFUMI]
Why are you giving me that look?

194
00:08:17,983 --> 00:08:20,692
This is what you deserve!

195
00:08:20,775 --> 00:08:24,275
You both deserve to die
for what you did to me!

196
00:08:25,317 --> 00:08:27,067
[NAOFUMI gasps]

197
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:31,483
[NAOFUMI panting]

198
00:08:31,567 --> 00:08:32,942
[RAPHTALIA]
Master Naofumi?

199
00:08:33,025 --> 00:08:34,567
[gasps]

200
00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:36,858
Why are you awake?
You all right?

201
00:08:36,942 --> 00:08:38,775
Don't worry. I'll be fine.

202
00:08:38,858 --> 00:08:39,942
Yeah, but...

203
00:08:40,025 --> 00:08:41,400
[NAOFUMI]
We have an early start tomorrow.

204
00:08:41,483 --> 00:08:43,067
You should get some rest.

205
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:47,108
[NAOFUMI]
They're scumbags.

206
00:08:47,192 --> 00:08:49,817
Why should I care
what happens to them?

207
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:58,942
[CITIZENS chattering]

208
00:08:59,025 --> 00:09:00,233
[MALD]
Hey, why aren't we allowed to

209
00:09:00,317 --> 00:09:02,150
enter the castle today?

210
00:09:02,233 --> 00:09:04,442
Only the Shield Hero
and his party can get in?

211
00:09:04,525 --> 00:09:05,567
What's the deal?

212
00:09:05,650 --> 00:09:06,900
[RISHIA]
P-Please, calm down, Sir Mald!

213
00:09:06,983 --> 00:09:08,317
[MALD]
Shut your mouth!

214
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:11,358
[RISHIA screams]

215
00:09:11,442 --> 00:09:13,483
That's a pretty big
crowd outside, huh?

216
00:09:13,567 --> 00:09:14,317
Yeah.

217
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,942
Hey, where did Mel go?

218
00:09:16,025 --> 00:09:17,733
I think she went off
with some of the knights

219
00:09:17,817 --> 00:09:20,025
as soon as we got
inside the castle walls.

220
00:09:20,108 --> 00:09:22,483
[NAOFUMI] I'm sure she's
with the queen by now.

221
00:09:23,608 --> 00:09:25,442
Glad to see you up and about.

222
00:09:25,525 --> 00:09:27,233
Guess that overpowered
move of yours

223
00:09:27,317 --> 00:09:28,942
didn't take too much
out of you then.

224
00:09:29,025 --> 00:09:31,692
Believe it or not, I'm still
a wreck on the inside.

225
00:09:31,775 --> 00:09:33,983
You haven't seen Myne
around anywhere, have you?

226
00:09:34,067 --> 00:09:36,567
She disappeared as soon
as the fight was over.

227
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:39,150
[REN] She must be busy with
her duties as a princess.

228
00:09:39,233 --> 00:09:41,608
Maybe she's putting together
a surprise party for us

229
00:09:41,692 --> 00:09:43,150
to celebrate defeating the Pope!

230
00:09:43,233 --> 00:09:45,650
Yeah, that's gotta
be it! Good thinkin'!

231
00:09:45,733 --> 00:09:46,817
[NAOFUMI sighs]

232
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:48,733
[MINISTER 21A]
Greetings, Cardinal Heroes.

233
00:09:48,817 --> 00:09:50,567
Please, come inside.

234
00:09:53,192 --> 00:09:54,400
[FILO giggles]

235
00:09:55,442 --> 00:09:57,650
Four Cardinal Heroes together.

236
00:09:57,733 --> 00:09:59,858
I thank you all for coming.

237
00:09:59,942 --> 00:10:01,692
[MOTOYASU]
Hm? Myne's not here.

238
00:10:01,775 --> 00:10:04,317
I don't see the king, either.

239
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,275
You can bring them in now.

240
00:10:08,525 --> 00:10:09,650
[gasps] Myne!

241
00:10:09,733 --> 00:10:11,858
[gasps] Sir Motoyasu! Help!

242
00:10:11,942 --> 00:10:13,692
[REN]
They've got the king in chains.

243
00:10:13,775 --> 00:10:15,025
What's going on?

244
00:10:15,108 --> 00:10:16,275
[MIRELIA]
That should be obvious.

245
00:10:16,358 --> 00:10:17,775
These two are criminals.

246
00:10:17,858 --> 00:10:18,608
[ALL gasp]

[MELTY gasps]

248
00:10:19,817 --> 00:10:21,942
Let's get started, shall we?

249
00:10:22,025 --> 00:10:25,942
The trial of the foolish king
consort and the first princess!

250
00:10:26,025 --> 00:10:28,442
[NOBLES, RAPHTALIA gasp]

251
00:10:28,525 --> 00:10:30,233
[CITIZENS chattering]

252
00:10:30,317 --> 00:10:31,400
[NOBLE 21A]
What's this?

253
00:10:31,483 --> 00:10:33,775
The king and the
princess are on trial?

254
00:10:33,858 --> 00:10:36,983
Well, things are sure getting
interesting, huh, kid?

255
00:10:37,067 --> 00:10:39,817
[MYNE] Mama, please,
why are you being so cruel?!

256
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:41,150
What is this?

257
00:10:41,233 --> 00:10:43,108
My queen, what cause have
you to do this to us?

258
00:10:43,192 --> 00:10:45,150
This isn't like you! [gasps]

259
00:10:45,233 --> 00:10:47,650
[MIRELIA] With the Four
Cardinal Heroes in attendance,

260
00:10:47,733 --> 00:10:50,067
this trial seeks to
punish those responsible

261
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:52,192
for shaking the
country to its core.

262
00:10:52,275 --> 00:10:54,567
As queen, I shall
serve as judge.

263
00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:56,067
[AULTCRAY]
What?

264
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:59,400
Don't tell me the Devil of
the Shield has brainwashed you?!

265
00:10:59,483 --> 00:11:01,150
[AULTCRAY groans]

266
00:11:01,233 --> 00:11:04,150
The Shield Hero has no such
ability and you know it.

267
00:11:04,233 --> 00:11:07,025
I can't believe I even
have to say that.

268
00:11:07,108 --> 00:11:08,358
[MYNE]
What's that?

269
00:11:08,442 --> 00:11:09,983
[MIRELIA]
To ensure a fair trial,

270
00:11:10,067 --> 00:11:12,650
you will be given a
temporary slave crest.

271
00:11:12,733 --> 00:11:14,900
Mama?! [gasps]

272
00:11:16,025 --> 00:11:17,775
[NAOFUMI]
Slave crest?

273
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:21,442
How can you do that?
She's your own daughter!

274
00:11:21,525 --> 00:11:24,275
[MIRELIA] Because my daughter
is a pathological liar.

275
00:11:24,358 --> 00:11:25,525
I'm not!

276
00:11:25,608 --> 00:11:28,108
You know that I'm a good
girl, an honest girl!

[MYNE groans]

282
00:11:43,692 --> 00:11:46,400
[MIRELIA] Let us officially
begin the trial now.

283
00:11:46,483 --> 00:11:49,317
Be warned, your crimes
are clear for all to see.

284
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:51,525
You cannot worm your
way out of this.

285
00:11:51,608 --> 00:11:54,233
You can't convict them of
anything without explanation!

286
00:11:54,317 --> 00:11:57,483
Besides, what so-called crimes
are you claiming they committed?

287
00:11:57,567 --> 00:11:59,567
[NAOFUMI sighs]
We have to start there?

288
00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:01,692
Let us begin with recent events.

289
00:12:01,775 --> 00:12:03,983
Using a fabricated holy weapon,

290
00:12:04,067 --> 00:12:06,442
the Pope of the Three Heroes
Church tried to murder

291
00:12:06,525 --> 00:12:09,025
the Cardinal Heroes and
frame the Shield Hero,

292
00:12:09,108 --> 00:12:10,817
but he was killed
in the attempt.

293
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:14,692
We're rounding up the remnants
of the Church as we speak.

294
00:12:14,775 --> 00:12:16,650
[MOTOYASU] What's that
have to do with anything?

295
00:12:16,733 --> 00:12:19,317
[MIRELIA] Appallingly,
the king and the first princess

296
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,692
were colluding with
the Church all along.

297
00:12:21,775 --> 00:12:23,233
No. That can't be...

298
00:12:23,317 --> 00:12:25,192
[MIRELIA]
Any objections to this charge?

299
00:12:25,275 --> 00:12:26,483
What reason would I have

300
00:12:26,567 --> 00:12:30,317
to collude with the Three
Heroes Ch--[screams]

301
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,567
It's appalling to think
the first princess

302
00:12:32,650 --> 00:12:34,358
would try to
overthrow the state.

303
00:12:34,442 --> 00:12:35,525
[MYNE]
N-No, I wouldn't!

304
00:12:35,608 --> 00:12:36,775
Forget about the Shield,

305
00:12:36,858 --> 00:12:38,983
they tried to kill the
other three heroes, too!

306
00:12:39,067 --> 00:12:40,900
They even came after
the royal family!

307
00:12:40,983 --> 00:12:42,775
I swear I would never
involve myself

308
00:12:42,858 --> 00:12:45,483
in such a terrible scheme!

309
00:12:45,567 --> 00:12:46,858
[MOTOYASU]
There, you see?

310
00:12:46,942 --> 00:12:47,942
Myne really didn't
do anything wrong!

311
00:12:48,025 --> 00:12:49,233
[MIRELIA]
All right, then.

312
00:12:49,317 --> 00:12:51,525
What about your plan
to assassinate Melty,

313
00:12:51,608 --> 00:12:52,817
the heir to the throne,

314
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:55,192
and then frame the
Shield Hero for her murder?

315
00:12:55,275 --> 00:12:56,733
[MYNE]
Wh--I didn't do anything li--

316

If you don't like it,
you can go ahead and die now.

S'up to you!

477
00:19:02,983 --> 00:19:05,900
By the way, Malty often uses
the alternate name Myne

478
00:19:05,983 --> 00:19:07,067
when she's adventuring.

479

How about that?

480
00:19:08,442 --> 00:19:11,525
Yeah... Guess Bitch needs
an adventurer name.

481
00:19:11,608 --> 00:19:12,483
How 'bout "Whore"?

482

[CITIZENS laughing]

00:19:15,775 --> 00:19:17,150
[MIRELIA]
The Shield Hero is the man

484
00:19:17,233 --> 00:19:19,650
that's done the most to
put things right here,

485
00:19:19,733 --> 00:19:22,858
and he is granting his
oppressors the greatest mercy.

486
00:19:22,942 --> 00:19:26,900
Therefore, Aultcray will
henceforth be known as "Trash."

487
00:19:26,983 --> 00:19:28,983
Malty will be called "Bitch."

488
00:19:29,067 --> 00:19:31,733
And her adventuring
name will be "Whore."

489
00:19:31,817 --> 00:19:33,650
Finally, the Three
Heroes Church,

490
00:19:33,733 --> 00:19:36,733
which was the root cause for
all this, will be abolished.

491
00:19:36,817 --> 00:19:39,567
Melromarc will now adopt
the Four Heroes Church

492
00:19:39,650 --> 00:19:40,983
as its state religion.

493
00:19:41,067 --> 00:19:42,400
Four Heroes Church?

494
00:19:42,483 --> 00:19:44,650
Wow, a church that worships
all four heroes equally!

495
00:19:44,733 --> 00:19:46,317
Sounds good to me!

496
00:19:50,067 --> 00:19:51,317
She just started a religion

497
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,733
that nobody else will
see as an enemy.

498

getting started!

about not wanting to
work with our country?

I'd still like to hold
a ceremony before you go,

to grant you your decorations
and rewards for your deeds.

You're correct, of course.
