[SOLDIER 25A] Your Majesty,
everyone's accounted for.

Either way, there's
nothing we can do.

[NAOFUMI]
It drains the enemy's SP...

Glass hesitate like that.

Yeah. I'm just peachy.

is completely useless now.

still bugging me.

51
00:02:07,666 --> 00:02:11,541
Glass's reaction to the Soul
Eater Shield wasn't normal.

00:02:11,625 --> 00:02:12,833
I wonder...

53
00:02:12,916 --> 00:02:14,291
All right, new plan.

54
00:02:14,375 --> 00:02:16,833
It's clear to me now that I
need to fight Glass alone.

00:02:16,916 --> 00:02:19,291
No way! Are you
out of your mind?

56
00:02:19,375 --> 00:02:21,916
[NAOFUMI] You three can
handle L'Arc and Therese.

Please don't tell me
that you're going to...

58
00:02:23,916 --> 00:02:26,625
[NAOFUMI] This way I won't
have to use that shield.

59
00:02:28,083 --> 00:02:29,250
Sounds good to me.

60
00:02:29,333 --> 00:02:31,875
If that's the case,
then you can sign me up.

You can't get away!

Ah, a one-on-one fight?

Well, that's exactly
what I was thinking.

00:02:52,458 --> 00:02:54,125
Although...

70
00:02:54,208 --> 00:02:57,875
You're letting them fight a duo
as strong as L'Arc and Therese?

You're placing an awful
lot of trust in your party.

L'Arc told me he's a hero,

73
00:03:03,041 --> 00:03:05,666
it's just that he's fighting
on behalf of another world.

That's correct.

I am also what the

Naofumi...

[NAOFUMI] All this shield does
to anyone else is drain SP.

105
00:04:28,625 --> 00:04:31,958
But with you, it seems to
suck out your life force.

The Wave will die down
if you retreat, won't it?

00:04:36,833 --> 00:04:39,166
So how 'bout we both
just call it a day?

"Call it a day"?

Oh, no. This battle's
not over just yet.

Not until one of us is dead.

get rid of me is if you kill me!

Otherwise, this world will end!

aren't you, Naofumi?

You want to protect
this world, right?

Then you should want me
dead right here and now!

I, uh...

131

Protect it? Is that what I want?

her world so badly.

It's do or die, Naofumi!

147

[NAOFUMI] Am I willing to
destroy all her hopes

00:06:43,375 --> 00:06:45,125
I won't let it happen.

163
00:06:45,208 --> 00:06:48,458
No one else will ever go
through what Rifana and I did!

164
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:49,916
Got that?

165
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,125
Raphtalia...

166
00:06:51,208 --> 00:06:54,708
You see, we have our
own reasons not to lose!

167
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:58,791
No, you don't!
Air Strike Shield!

168
00:06:59,958 --> 00:07:01,250
You okay?

[MIRELIA gasps]

175
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:15,583
This isn't good.

176
00:07:15,666 --> 00:07:17,000
I wish there was
something we could do

177
00:07:17,083 --> 00:07:18,375
to help them win this fight.

178
00:07:18,458 --> 00:07:20,666

Someone please help me!

I've got it!

[NAOFUMI gasps]

183
00:07:29,125 --> 00:07:30,791
Still not giving up?

[panting]

185
00:07:33,458 --> 00:07:35,291
Wait a sec... [gasps]

186
00:07:35,375 --> 00:07:37,833
Enough. Let's end this.

187
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:40,333
[L'ARC]
You can't! It's too risky!

188
00:07:40,416 --> 00:07:42,333
[THERESE]
You've done enough, Glass!

Blank-Stance Rondo...

190
00:07:46,958 --> 00:07:48,833
Don't do it, Master Naofumi!

191
00:07:48,916 --> 00:07:50,250
Don't use that shield!

192
00:07:50,333 --> 00:07:52,375
I'm really just
an outsider here.

193
00:07:52,458 --> 00:07:54,291
As soon as I finish
fighting off the Waves,

194
00:07:54,375 --> 00:07:56,666
I'm just gonna go
back to my own world.

195
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:57,875
[RAPHTALIA gasps]

196
00:07:58,916 --> 00:08:00,166
[NAOFUMI]
But you three--

197
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:03,791
Raphtalia, Filo, Melty...

198
00:08:03,875 --> 00:08:06,041
This world has you.

199
00:08:06,125 --> 00:08:08,875
That's my reason
for using this shield.

200
00:08:08,958 --> 00:08:12,250
And it's the only reason
I need to take Glass down!

201
00:08:12,333 --> 00:08:13,666
Don't do this...

202
00:08:16,083 --> 00:08:17,625
Now, sinner, I sentence you

203
00:08:17,708 --> 00:08:20,375
to cast your screams
unto the heavens above!

204
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:22,750
No, wait... Stop it, please!

205
00:08:22,833 --> 00:08:24,250
[NAOFUMI] The jaws of the
dragon born from my flesh

206

shall swallow you, and
you'll become an offering

to the gods as you howl in pain!

As source of thy
power, I order thee.

214
00:08:37,833 --> 00:08:41,208
Decipher the laws of nature
and unleash a gust of wind.

Here! You can use these!

[gasps]

220
00:08:54,541 --> 00:08:57,458
Wait, what did you do that for?

221
00:08:57,541 --> 00:08:59,500
What the hell is this?

222
00:08:59,583 --> 00:09:01,750
Oh, no. C'mon!

223
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:04,125
[NAOFUMI] They were
filled with cohol berries.

224
00:09:04,208 --> 00:09:06,500
[RAPHTALIA] Aren't those
what they use to make wine?

225
00:09:06,583 --> 00:09:08,375
[NAOFUMI]
Yeah, but for some reason,

226
00:09:08,458 --> 00:09:11,250
they don't seem to
have any effect on me.

227
00:09:11,333 --> 00:09:13,416
So? Finished yet?

228
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:16,208
No way. I'll kill you.

over. We're outta time.

[L'ARC] So congrats.
I guess you win this round.

234

[THERESE] But this won't be the
last time we meet in battle.

What do you two
think you're doing?

236

[L'ARC] Yell at us when you're
not about to throw up, huh?

See ya 'round, Naofumi.

239
00:09:40,375 --> 00:09:42,958
Heh. Feels wrong
to call you that.

240

The Wave. Did we win?

244
00:09:56,791 --> 00:09:59,208
Looks like it's over anyway.

245
00:09:59,291 --> 00:10:01,375
Naofumi soloed it again?

246
00:10:01,458 --> 00:10:05,375
No. Every one of us
played our part here.

247

[RAPHTALIA] Oh, Master
Naofumi! An accessory shop!

252
00:10:19,708 --> 00:10:21,333
Let's take a look.

253
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:25,708
[NAOFUMI]
Once the Wave was over,

254
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:28,500
we decided that we
were done leveling up.

255
00:10:28,583 --> 00:10:31,291
We were going to leave
Cal Mira's bonus field behind

256
00:10:31,375 --> 00:10:33,166
and head back to Melromarc,

257
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:35,125
except...

258
00:10:35,208 --> 00:10:38,166
[RAPHTALIA] See those dark
clouds out there on the horizon?

259
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:41,416
It won't be safe for us to
sail back through those.

260
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:44,291
You know an awful lot
about the sea, huh?

261
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:48,166
Wow! You keep catching so many!

262
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:50,291
I did grow up in
a fishing village.

263
00:10:50,375 --> 00:10:53,583
Yeah. Almost forgot.

264
00:10:53,666 --> 00:10:55,458
[NAOFUMI]
Because of the offshore storm,

265
00:10:55,541 --> 00:10:58,916
we decided to extend our
holiday for a few more days.

266
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,708
And yet... I still
couldn't relax.

267
00:11:02,791 --> 00:11:06,208
L'Arc and Glass said they were
heroes from another world...

268
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:08,958
...who were trying to
fight off their own Waves.

269
00:11:09,041 --> 00:11:11,083
In order to defend their world,

270
00:11:11,166 --> 00:11:14,208
they have to defeat heroes
from somewhere else.

271
00:11:14,291 --> 00:11:17,500
In other words,
they have to defeat us.

272
00:11:19,333 --> 00:11:22,625
[RAPHTALIA] So when we get
back... what are we going to do?

273
00:11:22,708 --> 00:11:25,625
[NAOFUMI] Well, prepare for
the next Wave, of course.

274
00:11:25,708 --> 00:11:27,166
[RAPHTALIA]
Right.

275
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:30,958
[NAOFUMI] But... if we have to
fight Glass's party again...

276
00:11:31,041 --> 00:11:33,208
...will I be able to kill them?

277
00:11:33,291 --> 00:11:35,250
I can't tell you how many
Waves will have passed

278
00:11:35,333 --> 00:11:36,583
when it happens,

279
00:11:36,666 --> 00:11:38,458
but a time is coming when
the world will demand

280
00:11:38,541 --> 00:11:40,833
great sacrifices from all of us.

281
00:11:40,916 --> 00:11:42,625
There will be a battle
in which the heroes

282
00:11:42,708 --> 00:11:45,333
will have to choose what
they're fighting for.

283
00:11:45,416 --> 00:11:49,125
[NAOFUMI] So we'll have to
choose which world to sacrifice?

284
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:51,500
Is that what you meant, Fitoria?

285
00:11:51,583 --> 00:11:54,083
[RAPHTALIA] Master Naofumi?
Is something on your mind?

286
00:11:54,166 --> 00:11:55,416
Well...

287
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,166
I was just thinking it
might be time to start

288
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:59,458
recruiting some new
additions to the party.

289
00:11:59,541 --> 00:12:00,791
That's a good idea.

290
00:12:00,875 --> 00:12:03,833
After all, Melty's busy
with her royal duties now.

291
00:12:03,916 --> 00:12:07,208
Let's gather as many weapons
and party members as we can.

292
00:12:07,291 --> 00:12:10,333
Who knows how strong Glass's
party will be next time.

293
00:12:10,416 --> 00:12:11,708
Huh?

294
00:12:11,791 --> 00:12:13,875
[NAOFUMI] If the Four
Cardinal Heroes end up dead,

295
00:12:13,958 --> 00:12:16,541
you guys will be this
world's only hope.

296
00:12:16,625 --> 00:12:17,416
Well, uh...

297
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:19,083
[FILO]
Master, come quick!

298
00:12:19,166 --> 00:12:20,166
[RAPHTALIA]
Hm?

299
00:12:22,583 --> 00:12:24,416
[RAPHTALIA]
You wanted to drown?!

300
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:25,791
[RISHIA whines]

301
00:12:25,875 --> 00:12:27,625
[FILO]
Yeah, but I saved her!

302
00:12:27,708 --> 00:12:29,375
[NAOFUMI]
Wasn't she in Itsuki's party?

303
00:12:29,458 --> 00:12:31,875
She told me her name was Rishia.

304
00:12:31,958 --> 00:12:34,416
I guess the Bow Hero kicked
her out of his party.

305
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:37,250
She said she's lost
hope completely.

306
00:12:37,333 --> 00:12:38,750
He kicked her out?

307
00:12:38,833 --> 00:12:41,083
She was accused of
something she didn't do.

308
00:12:41,166 --> 00:12:42,000
[gasps]

309
00:12:42,083 --> 00:12:44,791
[RISHIA]
I-I swear, it wasn't me!

310
00:12:44,875 --> 00:12:48,125
They said I broke one of Master
Itsuki's favorite accessories,

311
00:12:48,208 --> 00:12:49,833
but I didn't do it!

312
00:12:49,916 --> 00:12:51,208
That's awful.

313
00:12:51,291 --> 00:12:53,750
But it gave them an
excuse to get rid of her.

314
00:12:53,833 --> 00:12:55,166
[NAOFUMI]
If I had to guess,

315
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:57,125
I'd say the rest of his
party was embarrassed

316
00:12:57,208 --> 00:12:59,458
by her stealing the
spotlight in the Wave.

317
00:12:59,541 --> 00:13:01,000
Knowing Itsuki,

318
00:13:01,083 --> 00:13:04,125
he just trusted their accusation
blindly and threw her out.

319
00:13:04,208 --> 00:13:05,750
[RISHIA cries]

320
00:13:05,833 --> 00:13:08,541
Master Itsuki doesn't want
anything to do with me!

321
00:13:08,625 --> 00:13:10,083
I don't deserve to live!

322
00:13:10,166 --> 00:13:11,833
[NAOFUMI]
Rishia, right?

323
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:14,833
C'mon. Are you really
gonna take this lying down?

324
00:13:14,916 --> 00:13:17,250
Well, they're not wrong
about everything they said.

325
00:13:17,333 --> 00:13:19,416
I really am weak and useless.

326
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,708
Don't you want to teach Itsuki
and the rest of his party

327
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:24,208
a lesson for what
they've done to you?

328
00:13:24,291 --> 00:13:26,416
You helped me out
a lot during that Wave.

329
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:27,583
[RISHIA gasps]

330
00:13:27,666 --> 00:13:28,750
[BOTH]
Mm-hmm!

331
00:13:28,833 --> 00:13:31,833
[RISHIA] Really?
I helped the Shield Hero?

332
00:13:31,916 --> 00:13:33,708
You did. You saved everyone.

333
00:13:33,791 --> 00:13:36,666
And you have the courage
to grow so much stronger.

334
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:38,000
Do you believe that?

335
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:40,041
You really think
I'm brave and strong?

336
00:13:40,125 --> 00:13:42,833
Yes. Why don't you
join our party?

337
00:13:42,916 --> 00:13:44,791
I'd be happy to help
out however I can

338
00:13:44,875 --> 00:13:47,125
until you're able to
clear your name.

[RAPHTALIA]
Let's get stronger together.

341
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:52,166
[FILO] And maybe I can
teach you how to swim.

342
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:53,875
[RISHIA sobs]
Thank you!

343
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:57,166
Thank you so much for
inviting me to join with you!

344
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:59,416
Now you're training someone
else's party member?

345
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:01,375
You've become a
big softie, Naofumi.

346
00:14:01,458 --> 00:14:03,750
[NAOFUMI] If their parties
are as useless as they are,

347
00:14:03,833 --> 00:14:06,500
it'll cause real
problems for everyone.

[stomach growls]

349

[FILO]
Hey, where's the food?

350
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:14,250
[NAOFUMI, RAPHTALIA laugh]

351
00:14:14,333 --> 00:14:16,583
[NAOFUMI] Right.
How 'bout we eat something?

352
00:14:16,666 --> 00:14:18,541
--[RAPHTALIA] Great!
--[FILO] Yeah!

353
00:14:18,625 --> 00:14:20,791
[NAOFUMI] Before long,
the storm died down,

354
00:14:20,875 --> 00:14:24,208
and we were on our
way back to Melromarc.

355
00:14:24,291 --> 00:14:26,416
[MIRELIA]
Thank you again, Shield Hero.

356
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,375
Words cannot
express my gratitude

357
00:14:28,458 --> 00:14:29,916
for everything you've done.

358
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,583
I couldn't have done any
of these things by myself,

359
00:14:32,666 --> 00:14:34,166
without my friends.

360
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:37,583
And many thanks to
you, too, Your Majesty.

361
00:14:37,666 --> 00:14:40,041
You're giving me
too much credit.

362
00:14:40,125 --> 00:14:42,666
[NAOFUMI] I don't know if
we'll be so lucky next time.

363
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:45,541
The other heroes are
still completely useless.

364
00:14:45,625 --> 00:14:47,083
[MIRELIA]
I couldn't agree more.

365
00:14:47,166 --> 00:14:49,833
[NAOFUMI] Guess I need to
try and talk to them again.

366
00:14:49,916 --> 00:14:52,750
[MIRELIA] Yes. And sooner
rather than later.

367
00:14:52,833 --> 00:14:55,291
By the way, Shield Hero,
did you ever figure out

368
00:14:55,375 --> 00:14:56,750
the reward you wanted?

369
00:14:56,833 --> 00:14:58,083
[NAOFUMI]
Hm?

370
00:14:58,166 --> 00:14:59,958
[MIRELIA] I still have to
find a way to repay you

371
00:15:00,041 --> 00:15:03,250
for the part you played in
eliminating the pope, remember?

372
00:15:03,333 --> 00:15:04,916
Oh, yeah...

373
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,416
[MIRELIA]
And now there's so much more

374
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:08,208
that you've done
here in Cal Mira.

375
00:15:08,291 --> 00:15:11,875
If I don't do something soon,
I'll never be able to repay you.

376
00:15:11,958 --> 00:15:15,958
[NAOFUMI] Hmm. Actually,
I might have an idea.

377
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,208
Of course. I should've guessed

378
00:15:20,291 --> 00:15:23,041
you'd request something
selfless like that.

379
00:15:23,125 --> 00:15:25,708
[ERHARDT]
Oh, welcome back, kid!

380
00:15:25,791 --> 00:15:28,583
Hey, where'd you pick up
a cutie a like this?

381
00:15:28,666 --> 00:15:30,083
Ugh, give it a rest.

382
00:15:30,166 --> 00:15:32,125
I need you to put together
some equipment for all of us,

383
00:15:32,208 --> 00:15:33,375
including her.

384
00:15:33,458 --> 00:15:36,041
I'll buy whatever I can,
as thanks for last time.

385
00:15:36,125 --> 00:15:37,916
Now that's what I like to hear!

386
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,791
You planning to stick
around for a while?

387
00:15:39,875 --> 00:15:41,250
[NAOFUMI]
Nah, just a pit stop.

388
00:15:41,333 --> 00:15:42,666
There's somewhere we need to be.

389
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:44,583
Oh, yeah, I almost forgot.

390
00:15:44,666 --> 00:15:47,291
Where are we going?
What are you guys talking about?

391
00:15:47,375 --> 00:15:49,625
[ERHARDT]
Oh! Uh, nowhere special...

392
00:15:49,708 --> 00:15:51,000
Isn't that right, kid?

393
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:52,416
[NAOFUMI]
Right.

394
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:55,125
[RAPHTALIA] What's with
you two? C'mon, just tell me!

395

You know, you sure are
a lucky little lady.

396

Huh?

Come back if you need anything.

My door's always open!

[RAPHTALIA]
Master Naofumi?

400
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:07,500
Yeah?

401
00:16:07,583 --> 00:16:09,083
Can't you at least
tell me something

402
00:16:09,166 --> 00:16:10,458
about where we're going?

403
00:16:10,541 --> 00:16:11,791
[NAOFUMI]
Oh, sorry, uh,

404

we're on our way to
claim the queen's reward.

The one you were talking
about on the boat?

[sighs] You will stay with us,
right, Master Naofumi?

407
00:16:25,416 --> 00:16:26,458
Mm?

408
00:16:26,541 --> 00:16:28,541
Is that salt I smell?

409
00:16:28,625 --> 00:16:30,250
[NAOFUMI chuckles]
I should've known.

410
00:16:30,333 --> 00:16:31,875
You noticed that, huh?

411
00:16:31,958 --> 00:16:33,000
[RAPHTALIA]
Does that mean...

[NAOFUMI]
Yep. We're almost there.

You look good.

I'm glad you recovered!

Recovered so well, in fact,

harder than everyone else.

Oh, hey, Van,
what are you doing here?

know why you're here?

[RAPHTALIA]
What?

still a really big jerk.

tell me what's going on?

That was the queen's reward.

I'm officially the

Are you all being serious?

[NAOFUMI]
The way I see it,

438
00:17:39,791 --> 00:17:42,291
we're gonna need some
kind of home base.

439

lived in the capital

[NAOFUMI]
Yeah, but if I did that,

442
00:17:46,875 --> 00:17:47,958
it'd only be a matter of time

443
00:17:48,041 --> 00:17:50,375
before I'd run into

Workin' hard, I see.

as you can scrounge up

and bring to me.

474
00:18:55,625 --> 00:18:57,791
the rebuild will be
finished in no time.

475
00:18:57,875 --> 00:18:59,791
Why here?

476
00:18:59,875 --> 00:19:02,666
I chose this place
a long time ago.

477
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:05,500
Your village was once
destroyed by a Wave,

478
00:19:05,583 --> 00:19:08,375
but now it'll be a symbol
of resistance against them.

479
00:19:08,458 --> 00:19:11,041
Rishia won't be the
last person we recruit.

480
00:19:11,125 --> 00:19:12,958
We'll train them all
here and build an army

481
00:19:13,041 --> 00:19:15,416
bigger than the rest of
the heroes have combined.

482
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:16,875
That way, if something--

483
00:19:16,958 --> 00:19:18,166
[gasps]

484
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:20,166
Raphtalia?

485
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:24,250
Master Naofumi, please, I can't!

486
00:19:24,333 --> 00:19:25,750
It's too much!

487
00:19:25,833 --> 00:19:28,666
It feels like... like you're
trying to prepare us

488
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:31,000
for when you're not going
to be around anymore!

489
00:19:31,083 --> 00:19:33,125
It doesn't matter if
Glass, L'Arc, and Therese

490
00:19:33,208 --> 00:19:34,958
show up again, we can beat them.

491
00:19:35,041 --> 00:19:36,875
We can beat the
Waves! I know it!

492
00:19:36,958 --> 00:19:40,875
You're not going to die, Master
Naofumi! I won't let you!

493
00:19:40,958 --> 00:19:42,083
Raphtalia...

494
00:19:42,166 --> 00:19:43,875
[RAPHTALIA]
But, that doesn't really matter.

495
00:19:43,958 --> 00:19:45,541
Because once we
beat all the Waves,

496
00:19:45,625 --> 00:19:47,750
you're just gonna go
back to your world,

497
00:19:47,833 --> 00:19:49,625
and I'll never see you again.

498
00:19:49,708 --> 00:19:51,333
I never want that day to come!

499
00:19:51,416 --> 00:19:52,458
[NAOFUMI]
Yeah, well...

500
00:19:52,541 --> 00:19:54,333
[RAPHTALIA]
Never! I won't accept it!

501
00:19:54,416 --> 00:19:58,958
Just imagining a life without
you--it's absolutely unbearable!

502
00:19:59,041 --> 00:20:01,666
Because I... I just
don't want you to go!

503
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:05,041
Please, Master Naofumi!
Please stay!

504
00:20:05,125 --> 00:20:09,166
Even after the Waves are gone,
stay with us forever!

505
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:10,916
[NAOFUMI gasps]

[RAPHTALIA sobs]

507
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:14,916
This has been on your
mind for a while...

508
00:20:16,291 --> 00:20:17,583
[NAOFUMI]
I'm so sorry.

509
00:20:17,666 --> 00:20:21,000
[RAPHTALIA] Oh, no.
You don't have to apologize!

510
00:20:21,083 --> 00:20:24,416
I'll be honest,
I wasn't sure before.

511
00:20:29,708 --> 00:20:32,291
[NAOFUMI]
But... I am now.

512
00:20:32,375 --> 00:20:34,375
That's why I came here.

513
00:20:37,958 --> 00:20:39,875
[NAOFUMI]
We're gonna start over.

514
00:20:39,958 --> 00:20:43,583
If we're fighting the Waves or
looking for new party members,

515
00:20:43,666 --> 00:20:46,666
it all begins here.

516
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:51,041
When I met you, I found meaning
in having to fight the Waves.

517
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:55,000
Meeting Filo and Melty helped me
decide to fight for my friends.

518
00:20:55,083 --> 00:20:56,750
And I've met so
many other people

519
00:20:56,833 --> 00:20:59,333
that have made me want
to be the Shield Hero,

520
00:20:59,416 --> 00:21:01,791
and protect this world.

521
00:21:01,875 --> 00:21:04,416
It's going to be
our new beginning.

522
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:06,666
More importantly, our home.

523
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:08,375
Master Naofumi...

524
00:21:08,458 --> 00:21:12,583
Raphtalia, you'll keep on
fighting as my sword, won't you?

525
00:21:12,666 --> 00:21:16,083
Yes. Of course I will,
Master Naofumi!

526
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:20,125
[FILO]
Hey, that's no fair!

527

[VILLAGERS cheering]

536
00:21:43,375 --> 00:21:45,416
Are you watching, Rifana?

537
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:48,875
Can you see the flag flying
over our village again?

538
00:21:48,958 --> 00:21:52,125
And it's such a
beautiful flag, too.

539

[gasps]

540

[RAPHTALIA]
Master Naofumi?

541
00:22:11,375 --> 00:22:14,416
Yeah. Our story begins anew.

542
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:17,041
A fresh start for
the Shield Hero!

543
00:22:35,375 --> 00:22:38,166
Looks like Naofumi's settled
down in his own domain.

544
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:40,500
Guess it's up to us to
travel around the world

545
00:22:40,583 --> 00:22:42,500
and make it a better place.

546
00:22:44,375 --> 00:22:46,250
[REN]
I'll be so much stronger.

547
00:22:46,333 --> 00:22:49,791
Stronger than you could
ever hope to be, Naofumi!

548
00:22:49,875 --> 00:22:52,291
I can't believe the queen
gave the Devil of the Shield

549
00:22:52,375 --> 00:22:53,666
his own domain.

550
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:55,791
Isn't it outrageous,
Sir Motoyasu?

551
00:22:55,875 --> 00:22:57,333
Nah, I don't think so.

552
00:22:57,416 --> 00:22:59,500
In fact, we should
visit him some time.

553
00:22:59,583 --> 00:23:01,375
I'd like to see Filo, anyway.

554

[MYNE gasps]
Hmph.

555

It might behoove you to
keep an open mind, I say.

00:23:07,208 --> 00:23:08,458
"Behoove"?

That Shield Hero

certainly knows how to make
bold decisions, doesn't he?

I suppose it'll be a while
before he comes to see me again.

Remember, dear, you'll
always be my golden goose.
