[FITORIA] I need your

never gonna happen.

00:03:12,775 --> 00:03:16,317
[FITORIA] Nevertheless,
I must ask you to reconsider.

65
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,358
Why are you so obsessed with
making us work together anyway?

66
00:03:19,442 --> 00:03:21,275
[FITORIA] Because I had
made a promise of my own

67
00:03:21,358 --> 00:03:24,317
a long time ago,
to the hero who raised me.

68
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,775
And because, if this
world is going to survive,

69
00:03:27,858 --> 00:03:31,692
the Cardinal Heroes must work
together to fight off the Waves.

70
00:03:31,775 --> 00:03:33,067
I beg you.

71
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:35,358
No matter how many
times you ask,

72
00:03:35,442 --> 00:03:38,025
I'm not gonna make
nice with those idiots.

73
00:03:38,108 --> 00:03:39,525
Then there's no choice.

74
00:03:39,608 --> 00:03:42,525
If you won't work together,
new heroes will be summoned.

75
00:03:42,608 --> 00:03:45,108
Which means all four of
the heroes we have now

76
00:03:45,192 --> 00:03:47,442
must be removed.

like each other?

best for the world.

but I still can't do it.

doesn't change anything.

knock yourself out.

Not again!

[FITORIA] I understand
how you feel, Shield Hero.

96
00:04:34,983 --> 00:04:36,275
I'll give you a chance.

that you and your party

can defeat the
Waves of Catastrophe

without assistance
from the other heroes,

100
00:04:41,942 --> 00:04:43,275
I'll let you live.

101
00:04:43,358 --> 00:04:44,650
How do we do that?

102
00:04:44,733 --> 00:04:46,650
That's generous of you.

So what? You want us to
fight you right here?

are, in fact, strong enough,

110

I will release Melty.

And I also won't do
anything to harm the heroes

for the time being, either.

They'll live for now.

I don't really understand
everything you're saying,

but if I beat you,
Master won't be killed,

116
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:17,942
and you'll let
Mel go, too, right?

162

[NAOFUMI] The shield's defense
is like nothing to her!

163
00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:55,983
Master, you're hurt!

[FITORIA]
Eyes on your opponent.

[FILO groans]

166
00:08:00,067 --> 00:08:03,192
That attack was necessary to
prevent him from cheating.

167
00:08:03,275 --> 00:08:04,650
He deserved it.

168

[FILO pants]

169
00:08:06,025 --> 00:08:08,192
[FITORIA] Do you know
why he attempted that?

170
00:08:08,275 --> 00:08:10,733
Because you're weak, Filo.

171
00:08:10,817 --> 00:08:12,567
[FILO gasps]

172
00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:15,525
[FITORIA] Can you tell me
what you are fighting for?

173
00:08:15,608 --> 00:08:18,400
[FILO] I would've
thought that was obvious.

174
00:08:18,483 --> 00:08:20,775
I'm fighting for my master!

175
00:08:20,858 --> 00:08:22,442
You couldn't beat
the dragon last night

176
00:08:22,525 --> 00:08:24,317
and you can't beat me now.

177
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:27,567
How do you expect to be of
any use to the Shield Hero?

178
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:29,692
[FILO growls]
I'm won't lose to you!

179
00:08:29,775 --> 00:08:32,858
I'll become strong for
Master and I'll beat you!

180
00:08:32,942 --> 00:08:35,317
Not with willpower
as shallow as yours!

181

00:08:44,233 --> 00:08:46,442
Oh, Master Naofumi.
Are you all right?

184
00:08:46,525 --> 00:08:48,233
Yeah, I think I'm okay.

185
00:08:48,317 --> 00:08:50,983
[FILO] I'm not letting
Master get hurt ever again!

[BOTH gasp]

187
00:08:52,358 --> 00:08:54,983
[FILO] I'm... I'm going
to get so much stronger

188
00:08:55,067 --> 00:08:57,817
than I've ever been before!

189
00:08:57,900 --> 00:08:59,692
Will you?

[inhales]

191
00:09:06,192 --> 00:09:07,733
What's she doing?

192
00:09:07,817 --> 00:09:11,233
She's absorbing all the
mana particles in the air.

193
00:09:11,317 --> 00:09:13,775
I didn't think that
was even possible!

194
00:09:13,858 --> 00:09:15,400
[FILO gasps]

195

[NAOFUMI]
Filo!

[FILO]
Master...

197
00:09:19,358 --> 00:09:21,150
Stop worrying about me.

198
00:09:21,233 --> 00:09:22,650
I'll be fine, okay?

199
00:09:22,733 --> 00:09:25,025
Just stay calm and
watch her attacks!

200
00:09:25,108 --> 00:09:27,400
You can do this! I know it!

201
00:09:27,483 --> 00:09:29,317
[gasps]

202
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,483
I know that you can do this.

203
00:09:33,067 --> 00:09:34,150
[FILO]
Yeah!

204
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:41,567
You're too slow.

205
00:09:41,650 --> 00:09:44,150
[FILO]
Maybe, but I'll still beat you!

That was incredible!

Wow. Can you believe
she just did that?

213
00:10:22,525 --> 00:10:24,025
She did it.

I have to... for Master.

219

I have to be strong enough...

220

...to protect Mel...
and Raphtalia...

221

I have to be strong enough...
to protect everyone...!

[FITORIA]
Good.

That way...

00:10:58,442 --> 00:11:00,108
...I won't lose...

225

...ever again.

[FITORIA]
That's enough now, Filo.

227
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:08,150
I believe you've beaten me.

228

[FILO]
Huh?

229
00:11:10,067 --> 00:11:12,275
[FITORIA] And you've
earned Melty's freedom.

230
00:11:12,358 --> 00:11:14,650
You're strong enough after all.

I won.

Did you see?

239
00:11:31,108 --> 00:11:32,400
Sure did.

240

Huh?

Couldn't tell?

00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:51,192
Fitoria was testing you.

[FILO gasps]

247

[FITORIA]
Yes. But it was a serious test,

248
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:57,650
because if you hadn't passed it,
you would have died.

249
00:11:57,733 --> 00:11:59,525
And the Shield Hero
would have died as well.

Your reward.

To honor you for
overcoming my trial.

Successor?

259
00:12:25,608 --> 00:12:27,275
Are you saying that
Filo's going to become

260
00:12:27,358 --> 00:12:29,358
the next queen of the filolials?

Congratulations, Filo!

Uh--wha...?

I guess that's the symbol
of filolial royalty?

[NAOFUMI]
Their crown is a cowlick?!

Why?!

And it always will, so I'd
get used to it if I were you.

And as you grow older
and gain strength,

you'll have more of them.

something for you, as well.

No thanks. I really
don't want a cowlick.

My level's not high enough
yet to use many of them,

she gave me access

When you said...
you were testing Filo...

you took me hostage

Did you ever really try to

No, I didn't.

What's the use?

I'm going to leave you near

I hope you'll take the

[NAOFUMI]
You're not coming with us, then?

360

[FITORIA] I won't involve
myself any further.

[NAOFUMI]
Seriously?

So we're supposed to
suddenly be best friends.

Okay, I'll try my best.

00:17:34,067 --> 00:17:35,817
Was that all you wanted?

366
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:36,942
[FITORIA]
Not quite.

367
00:17:37,025 --> 00:17:38,067
You need to understand that

368
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:40,317
if even one Cardinal
Hero is missing,

369
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:43,442
fighting off a Wave
becomes almost impossible.

370
00:17:43,525 --> 00:17:46,025
In that case, it would
be better to kill you all

371
00:17:46,108 --> 00:17:49,233
to make room for a new group
of heroes to be summoned.

372
00:17:49,317 --> 00:17:50,983
So if I really can't
figure out a way

373
00:17:51,067 --> 00:17:53,025
to make things work
with the other three,

374
00:17:53,108 --> 00:17:56,025
you meant it when you said
you'd kill all four of us?

375
00:18:02,650 --> 00:18:03,942
I can't say how many Waves

376
00:18:04,025 --> 00:18:05,900
will have passed
when it happens,

377
00:18:05,983 --> 00:18:07,775
but a time is coming when
the world will demand

378
00:18:07,858 --> 00:18:09,733
great sacrifices from all of us.

379
00:18:09,817 --> 00:18:12,900
What kind of sacrifices
are you talking about?

380
00:18:12,983 --> 00:18:14,400
[FITORIA]
There will be a battle in which

381
00:18:14,483 --> 00:18:17,942
the heroes will have to choose
what they're fighting for.

382

That's the moment I'm dreading.

[NAOFUMI]
I don't get it.

384
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,108
[FITORIA]
Are you fighting for the world,

385
00:18:24,192 --> 00:18:26,608
or for the people
who inhabit it?

386
00:18:26,692 --> 00:18:28,400
If you choose to
fight for the world,

387
00:18:28,483 --> 00:18:30,567
many will lose their lives.

388
00:18:31,692 --> 00:18:35,650
[FITORIA] However, it will
allow you to fulfill your duty.

389
00:18:35,733 --> 00:18:39,442
And what happens if we decide
to fight for the people?

390
00:18:39,525 --> 00:18:41,608
That'll be a thorny path.

391
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:45,692
[NAOFUMI] How do you
know so much about this?

392
00:18:45,775 --> 00:18:49,108
There are too many things
that I've already forgotten.

393
00:18:49,192 --> 00:18:51,650
And yet... I do recall...

394
00:18:51,733 --> 00:18:53,650
Saving the world
and saving its people

395
00:18:53,733 --> 00:18:55,483
are not the same thing.

396
00:18:55,567 --> 00:18:57,900
The heroes that came before
you have always hoped

397
00:18:57,983 --> 00:19:00,358
that their successors would
fight for the latter.

398
00:19:00,442 --> 00:19:02,983
I don't quite understand,
but I guess it makes sense

399
00:19:03,067 --> 00:19:04,983
coming from
"heroes of the people."

400

You aren't ready to
make that choice.

It comes with many hurdles.

402
00:19:09,108 --> 00:19:11,442
And you can't conquer
them by yourself.

403

[NAOFUMI] Hey...
Why come to me with this?

404
00:19:16,775 --> 00:19:17,942
Wouldn't it be easier to

405
00:19:18,025 --> 00:19:20,150
convince one of the
others to forgive me?

406
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:25,817
I suppose it's
because I consider you

407
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:28,400
to be a hero of higher
worth than all the others.

408
00:19:28,483 --> 00:19:29,567
Why is that?

409
00:19:29,650 --> 00:19:31,150
You raised Filo.

410
00:19:31,233 --> 00:19:33,692
Anyone who could take care
of a future filolial queen

411
00:19:33,775 --> 00:19:35,817
can't be all bad.

412
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:37,650
I'm not so sure about that.

413

Whatever you say, Shield Hero.

414
00:19:40,608 --> 00:19:41,733
In any case,

415
00:19:41,817 --> 00:19:43,275
I do believe you're
up to the challenge of

416
00:19:43,358 --> 00:19:45,442
convincing the others
to work with you,

417
00:19:45,525 --> 00:19:47,692
even if you are a bad guy.

418
00:19:47,775 --> 00:19:51,067
And if not, the four
of you are far too weak.

419
00:19:51,150 --> 00:19:52,942
Even if I'm not
the one to do it,

420
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:55,900
you're all going to die,
sooner rather than later.

421
00:19:55,983 --> 00:19:57,483
Wait a minute.
Are the upcoming battles

422

really going to be that rough?

423
00:19:59,775 --> 00:20:01,608
Guess I'll just have to
get used to the Rage Shield,

424
00:20:01,692 --> 00:20:04,358
because I'm probably going
to need it more than ever.

425
00:20:04,442 --> 00:20:05,650
I'd advise against that,

426
00:20:05,733 --> 00:20:08,067
but if you truly
think it necessary...

427
00:20:12,650 --> 00:20:14,317
What are you doing?

428
00:20:17,858 --> 00:20:20,817
That will slow down the
Rage Shield's corrosion.

429
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:24,233
But it won't stop it completely,
so you should still be careful.

Use it as little as possible.
