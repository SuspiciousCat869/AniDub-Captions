[NAOFUMI] We heard there's
a village down this path.

The village is devastated.

Good morning. Oh, Doctor,
are these people with you?

us some medicine.

I should probably

67
00:04:25,067 --> 00:04:27,067

Well, actually,
it's a bit short.

But I guess I'll take it.

[HEALER 8A]
You were truly a great help.

00:05:06,317 --> 00:05:08,733
Now we've staved off
the immediate crisis.

00:05:08,817 --> 00:05:10,317
And that's enough for you?

79
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,150
All I did was
treat their symptoms.

80
00:05:12,233 --> 00:05:13,650
I didn't cure them.

81
00:05:13,733 --> 00:05:16,650
In no time, they'll be
right back to square one.

I'm afraid you are
indeed correct.

[NAOFUMI] Not that I mind, since
I'd make good money anyway.

We know that we can't let
this go on... But there's...

87
00:05:30,525 --> 00:05:32,775
There's nothing we can do.

00:05:32,858 --> 00:05:34,692
[RAPHTALIA]
What do you mean?

89
00:05:34,775 --> 00:05:36,275
We believe it's
the wind coming from

90
00:05:36,358 --> 00:05:38,817
the mountain that's the cause
of the plague in our village.

91
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:40,983
The mountain that's
home to the monsters.

92
00:05:41,067 --> 00:05:42,983
[NAOFUMI]
Home to what monsters?

93
00:05:43,067 --> 00:05:45,192
[HEALER 8A] Around a
month ago, a large dragon

94
00:05:45,275 --> 00:05:48,067
that nested there was
killed by the Sword Hero.

95
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:50,608
That, at least,
was the good news.

96
00:05:50,692 --> 00:05:53,358
[NAOFUMI] Yeah, I did hear
some rumors a while back.

97
00:05:53,442 --> 00:05:54,692
But wait a sec.

98
00:05:54,775 --> 00:05:56,817
How does that connect with
the plague that's here?

99
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:58,983
[HEALER 8A] Many adventurers
came to our village,

100
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:01,192
mostly in order to see
the dragon's corpse,

101
00:06:01,275 --> 00:06:03,400
as well as to purchase supplies.

102
00:06:03,483 --> 00:06:06,400
That certainly did help the
village to flourish, of course.

103
00:06:06,483 --> 00:06:07,775
But then, one day,

104
00:06:07,858 --> 00:06:10,692
one of the adventurers
collapsed, and more followed.

105
00:06:10,775 --> 00:06:12,650
The dragon's flesh
had begun to rot

106
00:06:12,733 --> 00:06:15,900
and began emitting
some kind of poison.

107
00:06:15,983 --> 00:06:17,400
[NAOFUMI]
Damn Ren!

108
00:06:17,483 --> 00:06:19,275
Even a high schooler like you
oughta have brains enough

109
00:06:19,358 --> 00:06:22,525
to know that meat rots
when you leave it out.

110
00:06:22,608 --> 00:06:25,358
Actually, I guess it
must've slipped his mind,

111
00:06:25,442 --> 00:06:27,858
since he thinks this
world's just a game.

112
00:06:27,942 --> 00:06:29,150
If you know what the cause is,

113
00:06:29,233 --> 00:06:31,525
how come you haven't
gotten rid of it already?

114
00:06:31,608 --> 00:06:33,442
That mountain's filled
with violent monsters,

115
00:06:33,525 --> 00:06:35,442
so the only ones who
even dare to go there are

116
00:06:35,525 --> 00:06:38,400
the adventurers--there's
nothing we can do about it.

117
00:06:38,483 --> 00:06:40,942
[HEALER 8A] And, perhaps
due to the dragon's poison,

118
00:06:41,025 --> 00:06:44,025
the very ecology of the
mountain has changed, too.

119
00:06:44,108 --> 00:06:45,608
Given the terrible consequences,

120
00:06:45,692 --> 00:06:49,192
the average adventurer won't
go anywhere near the corpse.

121
00:06:49,275 --> 00:06:51,150
Have you informed
the royal court yet?

122
00:06:51,233 --> 00:06:52,650
[HEALER 8A]
Yes. We're supposed to receive

123
00:06:52,733 --> 00:06:54,442
a delivery of medicine shortly.

124
00:06:54,525 --> 00:06:55,942
[ASSISTANT 8A] But they
said that the heroes are

125
00:06:56,025 --> 00:06:59,483
still too busy to help us yet,
so all we can do is wait.

126
00:06:59,567 --> 00:07:01,108
They're too busy to help?

127

Get ready, we're setting out.

00:07:07,108 --> 00:07:08,233
Right!

131
00:07:08,317 --> 00:07:09,817
Wait! You don't mean
to say you're planning

132
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:12,608
to go out there yourself!
It'll be far too dangerous!

133
00:07:12,692 --> 00:07:14,275
Oh, you don't need
to worry about us.

134
00:07:14,358 --> 00:07:15,733
We're used to danger.

135
00:07:15,817 --> 00:07:18,942
I just can't find the words
to express our gratitude.

136
00:07:19,025 --> 00:07:22,108
You can keep your thanks.
What I want is your money.

137
00:07:22,192 --> 00:07:23,525
Five hundred silvers will do it.

138
00:07:23,608 --> 00:07:26,483
[HEALER 8A]
Five hundred?! That's too much!

139
00:07:26,567 --> 00:07:28,317
That includes hazard pay
so you can just give me

140
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,942
what you were going
to pay the court,

141
00:07:30,025 --> 00:07:31,483
or were you hoping
for a discount?

"Savior," my foot.
He's just a lousy money-grubber.

143
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:35,858
[HEALER 8A]
You musn't speak like that.

144
00:07:35,942 --> 00:07:38,900
I don't recall asking
anybody to call me a savior.

145
00:07:42,525 --> 00:07:44,567
[RAPHTALIA] Master Naofumi,
you're deliberately trying

146
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:46,942
to make them
hate you, aren't you?

147
00:07:50,608 --> 00:07:53,150
[RAPHTALIA] Anyway, I know we're
dealing with a dragon here,

148
00:07:53,233 --> 00:07:56,275
but this is a lot more
than what we usually carry.

149
00:07:56,358 --> 00:07:58,192
[NAOFUMI] We had to take
the wagon either way.

150
00:07:58,275 --> 00:08:00,400
A little more luggage
isn't a problem.

151
00:08:00,483 --> 00:08:02,358
[RAPHTALIA] We could've
traveled much lighter if Filo

152
00:08:02,442 --> 00:08:04,567
hadn't thrown such a tantrum.

153
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:06,025
I've collected
a lifetime's worth

154
00:08:06,108 --> 00:08:08,067
of memories with this wagon.

155
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:09,858
We can't leave it behind!

156
00:08:09,942 --> 00:08:12,817
[NAOFUMI] Yeah, right,
a lifetime of a whole month.

157
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:14,400
[FILO growls]

158
00:08:14,483 --> 00:08:17,067
[RAPHTALIA] I don't know what
to do about Filo's selfishness.

159
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:18,400
[NAOFUMI] You know,
it might've actually been

160
00:08:18,483 --> 00:08:20,483
a pretty good idea after all.

161
00:08:20,567 --> 00:08:21,650
[RAPHTALIA gasps]

162
00:08:22,942 --> 00:08:23,858
[NAOFUMI]
We'll never get anywhere

163
00:08:23,942 --> 00:08:26,067
if we try to fight them all.

164
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:29,108
As Shield Hero, source of
thy power, I order thee.

165
00:08:29,192 --> 00:08:32,525
Decipher the laws of nature
and defend my target.

166
00:08:32,608 --> 00:08:34,400
Fast Guard!

167
00:08:34,483 --> 00:08:35,525
[FILO gasps]

168
00:08:35,608 --> 00:08:36,733
[NAOFUMI]
Run right through 'em, Filo!

169
00:08:36,817 --> 00:08:38,483
[FILO]
Okay!

170
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:47,983
[RAPHTALIA whimpers]

171
00:08:48,067 --> 00:08:49,317
[NAOFUMI]
The air here is terrible.

172
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,900
Stay back if you're
having a hard time.

173
00:08:51,983 --> 00:08:54,025
[RAPHTALIA]
No, don't worry. I'll be fine.

174
00:08:54,108 --> 00:08:55,233
[NAOFUMI]
Okay.

175
00:08:55,317 --> 00:08:56,567
But it would've been
a really good idea

176
00:08:56,650 --> 00:08:58,483
to eat before coming here.

177
00:08:58,567 --> 00:09:01,858
Looking at this isn't
doing wonders for my appetite.

178
00:09:01,942 --> 00:09:04,442
[FILO chomping]
I don't know what it is,

179
00:09:04,525 --> 00:09:06,608
but looking at it
sure made me hungry.

180
00:09:06,692 --> 00:09:08,692
[RAPHTALIA]
Try not to overeat!

181
00:09:08,775 --> 00:09:11,067
[NAOFUMI groans]
Given its size,

182
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:13,692
even taking it apart
will be a pain.

183
00:09:15,108 --> 00:09:16,608
[squelching]

184
00:09:16,692 --> 00:09:17,775
[NAOFUMI gasps]

185
00:09:31,692 --> 00:09:33,817
[NAOFUMI]
It's a damn dragon zombie!

186
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:35,442
What the--?!

187
00:09:35,525 --> 00:09:37,608
[RAPHTALIA]
What do we do, Master Naofumi?!

188
00:09:37,692 --> 00:09:39,942
[NAOFUMI]
For now, just get away from it!

189
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,775
[FILO yells]

190
00:09:42,858 --> 00:09:43,942
[NAOFUMI gasps]

191
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:48,692
A dragon?! I hate dragons!

192
00:09:48,775 --> 00:09:49,733
[NAOFUMI gasps]

193
00:09:49,817 --> 00:09:51,150
[FILO grunts]

194
00:09:52,233 --> 00:09:54,525
There might just
be a way to fight it.

195
00:09:58,150 --> 00:10:00,733
Get behind me,
you two! And do it now!

196
00:10:05,108 --> 00:10:07,442
[RAPHTALIA coughs]

197
00:10:07,525 --> 00:10:10,275
[NAOFUMI] My shield can't
block all its poison breath.

198
00:10:10,358 --> 00:10:12,900
I have resistance,
but Raphtalia doesn't!

199
00:10:12,983 --> 00:10:14,400
But still...

200
00:10:14,483 --> 00:10:18,650
If we don't stop it here,
it'll cause even more damage!

201
00:10:18,733 --> 00:10:19,567
[NAOFUMI growls]

202
00:10:19,650 --> 00:10:20,650
Now I'm mad!

203
00:10:20,733 --> 00:10:24,067
[gasps] Filo!
Don't fight it alone!

204
00:10:27,608 --> 00:10:30,025
If we don't get away
and regroup, we're finished!

205
00:10:30,108 --> 00:10:31,650
We gotta go, Raphtalia.

206
00:10:31,733 --> 00:10:32,983
Filo, c'mon!

207
00:10:33,067 --> 00:10:34,150
[RAPHTALIA gasps]

208
00:10:34,233 --> 00:10:38,150
[NAOFUMI]
That idiot! Hey! Filo!

209
00:10:38,233 --> 00:10:39,317
Huh--?

210
00:10:45,775 --> 00:10:48,650
Filo!

211

Filo!

00:10:53,817 --> 00:10:55,692
[NAOFUMI growls]

215
00:11:08,525 --> 00:11:10,275
[NAOFUMI]
Again?

216
00:11:10,358 --> 00:11:13,525
Am I going to lose it all again?

217
00:11:13,608 --> 00:11:18,358
Is this world going to...
take everything from me again?

218
00:11:21,317 --> 00:11:22,525
[NAOFUMI]
Power?

219
00:11:25,692 --> 00:11:27,150
[NAOFUMI]
Hate.

220
00:11:37,108 --> 00:11:39,233
[NAOFUMI]
I hate it.

221
00:11:39,317 --> 00:11:41,150
I hate it all.

222
00:11:44,275 --> 00:11:45,900
[laughs]

223
00:11:45,983 --> 00:11:47,483
[NAOFUMI]
Hate...

224
00:11:53,608 --> 00:11:57,608
[NAOFUMI]
Hate!

225
00:12:05,192 --> 00:12:09,817
How dare you
kill her! Filo! [gasps]

226
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:12,150
No! Master Naofumi!

227
00:12:21,942 --> 00:12:25,150
[RAPHTALIA gasps]
Master Naofumi!

228
00:12:30,983 --> 00:12:32,067
[RAPHTALIA]
No...

229
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:34,983
Not Master Naofumi, too...

230
00:12:35,067 --> 00:12:36,483
[RAPHTALIA gasps]

231
00:12:38,025 --> 00:12:39,192
[RAPHTALIA gasps]

232
00:12:44,067 --> 00:12:48,275
[NAOFUMI growls]

233
00:12:48,358 --> 00:12:52,775
[yells]

234
00:12:52,858 --> 00:12:54,817
Master Naofumi!

235
00:12:58,192 --> 00:12:59,567
[RAPHTALIA gasps]

236
00:13:24,358 --> 00:13:26,067
Now burn.

237
00:13:37,858 --> 00:13:40,108
[NAOFUMI]
Kill.

238
00:13:40,192 --> 00:13:42,150
Kill them all.

239
00:13:53,733 --> 00:13:55,775
[NAOFUMI]
Suffer.

240
00:13:59,733 --> 00:14:04,358
[NAOFUMI]
Die!

241
00:14:05,317 --> 00:14:07,483
[RAPHTALIA]
I believe you.

242
00:14:07,567 --> 00:14:09,483
[NAOFUMI gasps]

243
00:14:09,567 --> 00:14:12,233
[RAPHTALIA] I swear
to be your sword forever!

244
00:14:12,317 --> 00:14:13,483
[NAOFUMI]
That voice...

245
00:14:13,567 --> 00:14:15,025
What...

246
00:14:15,108 --> 00:14:16,733
[RAPHTALIA] This is a world
where it's hard to find people

247
00:14:16,817 --> 00:14:19,983
to trust, but I know
I can trust you.

248
00:14:20,067 --> 00:14:23,775
I trust the great Shield Hero.

249
00:14:23,858 --> 00:14:27,608
[gasps] What was I doing?

250
00:14:27,692 --> 00:14:30,567
[RAPHTALIA]
Master Naofumi...

251
00:14:30,650 --> 00:14:33,233
I'm so glad...
that you're back to--

252
00:14:33,317 --> 00:14:35,108
[coughs]

253
00:14:36,067 --> 00:14:37,775
[NAOFUMI gasps]
Raphtalia!

254
00:14:37,858 --> 00:14:40,025
What is all this?

255
00:14:40,108 --> 00:14:41,817
What the hell...

256
00:14:43,358 --> 00:14:46,608
As Shield Hero, source of
thy power, I order thee.

257
00:14:46,692 --> 00:14:49,900
Decipher the laws of nature
and heal my target.

258
00:14:49,983 --> 00:14:51,733
Fast Heal!

259
00:14:54,275 --> 00:14:56,525
[gasps] And heal my target!

260
00:14:56,608 --> 00:14:58,233
Fast Heal!

261
00:14:59,275 --> 00:15:01,275
Come on, I said heal, dammit!

262
00:15:01,358 --> 00:15:03,900
Fast Heal! Fast Heal!

263
00:15:03,983 --> 00:15:06,567
It's all my fault...

264
00:15:06,650 --> 00:15:08,983
Stay away from her!

265
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:11,275
[NAOFUMI gasps]

266
00:15:12,608 --> 00:15:14,775
C'mon!

267
00:15:16,525 --> 00:15:20,108
[NAOFUMI] To defeat the dragon,
I have to use this power.

268
00:15:20,192 --> 00:15:21,317
But...

269
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:25,608
If I lose focus,
hatred will consume my mind.

270
00:15:25,692 --> 00:15:27,275
What can I do?!

271
00:15:37,108 --> 00:15:38,358
[gasps]

272
00:15:47,775 --> 00:15:48,858
What happened?

273
00:15:48,942 --> 00:15:49,983
I don't--

274
00:15:50,067 --> 00:15:52,192
Master Naofumi?

275
00:15:52,275 --> 00:15:53,983
Raphtalia!

276
00:15:54,067 --> 00:15:55,483
You okay?

277
00:15:56,525 --> 00:15:57,775
Yes, I am...

278
00:15:57,858 --> 00:16:01,400
Thanks to your healing,
Master Naofumi.

279
00:16:01,483 --> 00:16:04,942
And... I'm glad we finally
defeated the dragon...

280
00:16:17,650 --> 00:16:19,608
[FILO sighs]

281
00:16:19,692 --> 00:16:22,233
Filo! You're alive!

282
00:16:22,317 --> 00:16:24,817
Well, It took me
a little while, but I'm out!

283
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:25,942
[NAOFUMI]
You okay?

284
00:16:26,025 --> 00:16:27,275
[FILO]
Mm-hmm!

285
00:16:27,358 --> 00:16:30,275
But it ate you. And there
was blood everywhere...

286
00:16:30,358 --> 00:16:32,692
Blood? Oh, that was
just the fruit

287
00:16:32,775 --> 00:16:36,150
I threw up when
the dragon gobbled me up.

288
00:16:38,233 --> 00:16:40,400
Seriously,
you threw up your snack?

289
00:16:40,483 --> 00:16:42,108
That's so sweet of you, Master.

290
00:16:42,192 --> 00:16:45,358
Thank you so much
for worrying about me.

291
00:16:45,442 --> 00:16:46,858
Who was worried?

292
00:16:46,942 --> 00:16:49,192
[FILO] Then why are you
looking away from me?

293
00:16:49,275 --> 00:16:50,692
[NAOFUMI]
Get outta here...

294
00:16:50,775 --> 00:16:54,067
[RAPHTALIA] So, wait, Filo--
you killed the dragon, too?

295
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:56,233
Sure! And you know what else?

296
00:16:56,317 --> 00:16:58,817
While I was tearing at
its belly trying to get out,

297
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:02,150
I found a big purple crystal.

298
00:17:02,233 --> 00:17:03,567
It was so shiny!

299
00:17:03,650 --> 00:17:05,442
[NAOFUMI]
A crystal?

300
00:17:05,525 --> 00:17:08,358
So that must have been
the source of its power.

301
00:17:08,442 --> 00:17:10,900
And what did you do
with the crystal?

302
00:17:10,983 --> 00:17:12,567
[belches]

303
00:17:14,567 --> 00:17:15,817
[NAOFUMI]
You ate it?!

304
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:17,692
[RAPHTALIA laughs]

305

--[RAPHTALIA coughs]
--Uh-- Raphtalia!

306
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,733
[FILO]
Master, what's wrong?

307
00:17:20,817 --> 00:17:23,150
Filo, we gotta
give her medicine.

308
00:17:23,233 --> 00:17:24,817
Then we'll head back
to the village.

309
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:26,483
--[RAPHTALIA] No.
--[NAOFUMI gasps]

310
00:17:26,567 --> 00:17:28,650
We have to get rid of
the dragon's body first.

311
00:17:28,733 --> 00:17:30,650
[NAOFUMI]
You come first!

312
00:17:30,733 --> 00:17:33,275
Stop worrying. I promise
I'll take the medicine

313
00:17:33,358 --> 00:17:36,483
and then rest, and I just
know that I'll feel better.

314

Filo. Let's clean up this mess.

315
00:17:39,275 --> 00:17:40,483
[FILO]
Mm!

316
00:17:41,525 --> 00:17:44,150
[HEALER 8A] The mountain
wind has gone back to normal.

317
00:17:44,233 --> 00:17:46,733
We'll be all right now.

318
00:17:46,817 --> 00:17:49,317
Thank you so very much.

319
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:52,150
Go ahead and use that money
to treat Raphtalia.

320
00:17:52,233 --> 00:17:55,817
I don't care how much
it costs. Just cure her.

321
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:58,650
[HEALER 8A]
Curing her will be difficult.

322
00:17:58,733 --> 00:18:00,525
She's been afflicted
with a curse,

323
00:18:00,608 --> 00:18:02,817
and a powerful one at that.

324
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:04,275
We've done what we can:

325
00:18:04,358 --> 00:18:07,192
we wrapped her with bandages
soaked in holy water,

326
00:18:07,275 --> 00:18:09,317
but we don't have a holy water
that's pure enough

327
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:12,025
to dispel curses like this.

328
00:18:12,108 --> 00:18:14,400
However, if you go to
a church in a big town,

329
00:18:14,483 --> 00:18:16,150
I know you'll find some.

330
00:18:16,233 --> 00:18:18,942
Please keep this money
for when you do.

331
00:18:20,317 --> 00:18:21,942
Thanks, Doc.

332
00:18:24,608 --> 00:18:26,858
Raphtalia, how are you feeling?

333
00:18:26,942 --> 00:18:30,483
[RAPHTALIA] Well, they've taken
good care of me. I feel better.

334
00:18:30,567 --> 00:18:31,733
I never knew that corpses

335
00:18:31,817 --> 00:18:34,608
could inflict such
powerful curses.

336
00:18:34,692 --> 00:18:37,817
I just can't believe
how terrifying dragons are.

337
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:39,067
I know, right?

338
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:40,692
I shouldn't have been
so careless and gotten

339
00:18:40,775 --> 00:18:43,025
all that rotten flesh on me.

340
00:18:44,817 --> 00:18:45,733
[ASSISTANT 8A]
Hm?

341
00:18:45,817 --> 00:18:46,900
[ASSISTANT 8A giggles]

342
00:18:46,983 --> 00:18:48,858
He cares very much
about you, doesn't he?

343
00:18:48,942 --> 00:18:51,192
Eh? Well, I don't think, uh--

344
00:18:51,275 --> 00:18:53,900
Take care, Raphtalia. Bye!

345
00:18:53,983 --> 00:18:55,233
[FILO]
Hm?

346
00:18:56,358 --> 00:18:58,025
I'm really sorry.

347
00:18:58,108 --> 00:19:00,150
Everything's all right.

348
00:19:00,233 --> 00:19:02,150
It's just that,
I got this strange feeling

349
00:19:02,233 --> 00:19:04,692
that power would take
you somewhere far away.

350
00:19:04,775 --> 00:19:07,192
And I couldn't bear that.

351
00:19:07,275 --> 00:19:09,483
And so, given that
I was able to stop you

352
00:19:09,567 --> 00:19:13,400
before that, this doesn't
bother me in the slightest.

353
00:19:15,025 --> 00:19:16,650
What does she mean, Master?

354
00:19:16,733 --> 00:19:18,400
You're not leaving, are you?

355
00:19:18,483 --> 00:19:21,067
[NAOFUMI]
I'm not going anywhere.

356
00:19:21,150 --> 00:19:23,858
Oh! I have a gift for you,
Master! Right here!

357
00:19:23,942 --> 00:19:25,567
[NAOFUMI]
Huh?

358
00:19:25,650 --> 00:19:26,942
What's this?

359
00:19:28,442 --> 00:19:30,983
It's a crystal I found
inside the dragon.

360
00:19:31,067 --> 00:19:32,817
Filo, tell me you
didn't throw that up!

361
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:34,858
--[NAOFUMI gasps]
--Of course not!

362
00:19:34,942 --> 00:19:38,108
I kept this one 'cause
I wanted to give you a gift!

363
00:19:38,192 --> 00:19:39,525
[NAOFUMI]
If this is a crystallization of

364
00:19:39,608 --> 00:19:42,817
the residual mana from
the dragon's corpse...

365
00:19:49,983 --> 00:19:52,650
[NAOFUMI]
My level isn't high enough?

366
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:55,733
That shield wasn't
in the upgrade tree.

367
00:19:55,817 --> 00:19:58,275
If I'd continued
to use its power,

368
00:19:58,358 --> 00:20:01,233
I would've killed both
Raphtalia and Filo

369
00:20:01,317 --> 00:20:04,275
while she was still
inside the dragon.

370
00:20:04,358 --> 00:20:06,858
Master Naofumi?

371
00:20:06,942 --> 00:20:09,775
[NAOFUMI]
Forgive me, both of you.

372
00:20:09,858 --> 00:20:10,900
I put you in grave danger

373
00:20:10,983 --> 00:20:15,025
because I hesitated
for an instant.

374
00:20:15,108 --> 00:20:17,692
Just as bravery and
recklessness are different,

375
00:20:17,775 --> 00:20:20,025
so are caution and cowardice.

376
00:20:20,108 --> 00:20:21,650
If I remain a coward,

377
00:20:21,733 --> 00:20:24,442
I'll fail to protect
the things I care about.

378
00:20:24,525 --> 00:20:26,400
Back there,
I should've stepped up

379
00:20:26,483 --> 00:20:28,608
and distracted the dragon.

380
00:20:28,692 --> 00:20:31,192
There were so many
things I could've done!

381
00:20:31,275 --> 00:20:33,775
It wasn't your fault,
Master Naofumi!

382
00:20:33,858 --> 00:20:36,317
If only I'd been stronger,
I could have done more to help!

383
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,567
Yeah. Because I
hate dragons so much,

384
00:20:38,650 --> 00:20:41,733
I charged in when
I shouldn't have.

385
00:20:41,817 --> 00:20:43,567
You both are...

386
00:20:48,525 --> 00:20:51,733
We are so much stronger now
than we ever were before.

387
00:20:51,817 --> 00:20:54,233
And we'll be even
stronger tomorrow.

388
00:20:54,317 --> 00:20:56,650
Let's keep that up,
one day at a time.

389
00:20:56,733 --> 00:20:58,275
Yes. Together.

390
00:20:58,358 --> 00:21:00,942
Yeah! The three of us!

391
00:21:01,025 --> 00:21:02,108
Okay!

392
00:21:02,192 --> 00:21:04,567
Wow, you smiled, Master!

393
00:21:04,650 --> 00:21:05,608
Huh?

394
00:21:05,692 --> 00:21:07,192
[RAPHTALIA]
She's right! It's true!

395
00:21:07,275 --> 00:21:09,608
You finally showed us
an actual smile.

396
00:21:09,692 --> 00:21:11,275
[NAOFUMI]
Did I? Uhh...

397
00:21:11,358 --> 00:21:13,942
Yep! Right, Raphtalia?
He smiled!

398
00:21:14,025 --> 00:21:14,942
Sure did!

399
00:21:15,025 --> 00:21:17,233
[BOTH laugh]

400
00:21:17,317 --> 00:21:19,275
It's getting pretty late now.

401
00:21:19,358 --> 00:21:21,275
Time to rest up
and get some sleep.

402
00:21:21,358 --> 00:21:23,192
'Kay! [giggles]

403
00:21:23,275 --> 00:21:24,983
U-Um...

404
00:21:26,025 --> 00:21:27,942
Master Naofumi,
would you be willing

405
00:21:28,025 --> 00:21:29,858
to spend the night with me?

406
00:21:29,942 --> 00:21:31,358
Feeling a little lonely tonight?

407
00:21:31,442 --> 00:21:33,067
Oh, it's not that.

408
00:21:33,150 --> 00:21:35,858
I just thought I should be
allowed to have this, for once.

409
00:21:35,942 --> 00:21:37,692
--[NAOFUMI] Filo...
--[RAPHTALIA] Hm?

410
00:21:37,775 --> 00:21:39,858
[NAOFUMI]
Sleep with Raphtalia tonight.

411
00:21:39,942 --> 00:21:41,692
--Yes, sir!
--Huh?

412
00:21:41,775 --> 00:21:43,442
[NAOFUMI]
You're cold, aren't you?

413
00:21:43,525 --> 00:21:45,317
No, that's not what
I'm talking about.

414
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:47,067
What I meant was...

415
00:21:47,150 --> 00:21:48,817
Aren't you going
to join us, Master?

416
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:49,817
It'll be more fun.

417
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:50,817
[NAOFUMI]
Not a chance.

418
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:52,150
--[FILO] Huh?
--[RAPHTALIA] Uhh?

419
00:21:52,233 --> 00:21:54,567
I'm not exactly
a warm kinda guy.

420
00:21:56,358 --> 00:21:58,108
[BOTH whine]

421
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:04,983
[NAOFUMI]
I have to grow stronger...

422
00:22:06,483 --> 00:22:09,150
[NAOFUMI] Along with
the people who believe in me.

423
00:22:10,567 --> 00:22:15,317
[NAOFUMI] And I'll protect them,
no matter what happens!
