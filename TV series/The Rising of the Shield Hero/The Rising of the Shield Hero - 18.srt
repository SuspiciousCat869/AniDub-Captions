God bestowed holy
water upon you,

The Spear Hero and his party,
including the princess,

were murdered by the
Devil of the Shield.

At least that's the story
the world will be told.

you're all dead already.

the hell he's talking about?

426
00:19:50,108 --> 00:19:52,692
And if the lives of those who
have been marked for death

For example...

The Spear Hero released a
sealed monster upon the world,

452

the Sword Hero
caused an epidemic,

and the Bow Hero
ignored his duties,

to serve himself.

I wanted to help!
