You have to hear me out!

I don't "have to"
listen to a damn word

His Royal Majesty calls.

Please come with us.

[MELTY]
Very well, I'll go.

No. Don't.

[MIRELIA] Melty, I need you
to do something for me.

40
00:02:32,025 --> 00:02:33,442
[MELTY]
Of course.

41
00:02:33,525 --> 00:02:35,567
[MIRELIA] I want you to return
to the capital right away

42
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:37,567
and admonish the king
for his unjust

43
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:39,983
and outrageous treatment
of the Shield Hero.

44
00:02:40,067 --> 00:02:43,567
Ordinarily, I would go myself,
but as you know...

45
00:02:45,358 --> 00:02:48,067
You can always
count on me, Mother.

46
00:02:53,567 --> 00:02:54,817
[RAPHTALIA]
Why couldn't you have given her

47
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:56,858
a chance to at least
explain herself?

48
00:02:56,942 --> 00:02:58,608
Ya know, she's got a point, kid.

49
00:02:58,692 --> 00:03:00,608
Hey, Master, I don't understand.

50
00:03:00,692 --> 00:03:03,233
How could you
treat Mel so coldly?

51
00:03:03,317 --> 00:03:07,067
Why? Tell me why! Please!

52
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:08,775
Listen to me, Filo.

53
00:03:08,858 --> 00:03:11,275
It's not a good idea to
play with Melty anymore.

54
00:03:11,358 --> 00:03:12,733
What?

55
00:03:12,817 --> 00:03:15,317
Master Naofumi, speaking
to her like a father

56
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,900
isn't going to help Filo
understand things any better.

57
00:03:17,983 --> 00:03:19,733
Why, Master? Why?

58
00:03:19,817 --> 00:03:21,358
Mel hasn't done anything wrong!

59
00:03:21,442 --> 00:03:23,942
Please tell me why I can't
play with her anymore!

60
00:03:24,025 --> 00:03:28,817
Please, Master, tell me why!
Please, please! Tell me!

61
00:03:38,275 --> 00:03:40,483
Master Naofumi...

62
00:03:40,567 --> 00:03:43,358
Is this about Mel being
the daughter of the King?

63
00:03:52,275 --> 00:03:55,025
[NAOFUMI]
I can't trust them. Any of them.

64

[gasps]

65

Excuse me, Master...

66
00:04:07,192 --> 00:04:10,608
[NAOFUMI] Quit skulking around
and just come inside.

67
00:04:10,692 --> 00:04:12,858
You have visitors.

68
00:04:12,942 --> 00:04:14,608
I apologize.

69
00:04:15,692 --> 00:04:17,025
It's you again?

70
00:04:17,108 --> 00:04:19,900
What the hell do you want?

71
00:04:19,983 --> 00:04:23,983
Uh... Well, uh, we...
Actually, I, uh...

72
00:04:24,067 --> 00:04:26,483
Please let us
accompany you, Shield Hero!

73
00:04:26,567 --> 00:04:28,317
At least during the Waves!

74
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,525
[ALL gasp]

75
00:04:29,608 --> 00:04:31,025
[AKE] We were deeply
touched by your courage

76
00:04:31,108 --> 00:04:33,733
and selflessness when you
fought in the last Wave.

77
00:04:33,817 --> 00:04:35,567
Everyone here wants
nothing more than

78
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:37,942
to support you in
your tireless quest.

79
00:04:38,025 --> 00:04:40,358
[NAOFUMI] Wait, is that
why you keep chasing me?

80
00:04:40,442 --> 00:04:41,608
Yes!

81
00:04:41,692 --> 00:04:43,108
We'd all decided that
we would ask to fight

82
00:04:43,192 --> 00:04:45,108
side by side with you
the next time we saw you

83
00:04:45,192 --> 00:04:46,317
here in the capital.

84
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,858
If this is about
fighting the Waves,

85
00:04:47,942 --> 00:04:49,483
you can do that
without following me.

86
00:04:49,567 --> 00:04:50,567
Just do it yourself.

87
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:52,483
[AKE]
No, Sir Shield Hero.

88
00:04:52,567 --> 00:04:55,067
The point is we wanna
fight together with you!

89
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:56,775
You mind telling me why?

90
00:04:56,858 --> 00:04:57,817
Because, Sir Hero,

91
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:59,692
we all hail from
the village of Lute.

92
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:01,692
Back then, you saved
all of our families

93
00:05:01,775 --> 00:05:03,192
from a tragic end.

94
00:05:10,608 --> 00:05:11,733
So you see, sir,

95
00:05:11,817 --> 00:05:13,525
we wanna help in any way we can.

96
00:05:13,608 --> 00:05:15,942
We wanna repay you for
saving our fellow villagers,

97
00:05:16,025 --> 00:05:17,275
that's all.

98
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:23,900
[NAOFUMI]
Buy this for 150 silver pieces.

99
00:05:23,983 --> 00:05:25,150
Huh?

100
00:05:25,233 --> 00:05:26,233
[NAOFUMI] I'll consider
your offer if you can

101
00:05:26,317 --> 00:05:27,400
cough up the cash.

102
00:05:27,483 --> 00:05:28,483
Eh?

103
00:05:28,567 --> 00:05:29,900
What's wrong?

104
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:33,025
You can gain my trust by
buying this trinket right now.

105
00:05:33,108 --> 00:05:34,942
[RAPHTALIA]
Master Naofumi...

106
00:05:35,025 --> 00:05:37,525
But 150 silver pieces?

107
00:05:37,608 --> 00:05:38,442
Now what?

108
00:05:38,525 --> 00:05:40,900
We'll just have to arrange it.

109
00:05:40,983 --> 00:05:42,192
We understand.

110
00:05:42,275 --> 00:05:44,942
We'll gather the
silver pieces right now.

111
00:05:46,067 --> 00:05:47,608
[RAPHTALIA] I can't believe
you're pressuring them

112
00:05:47,692 --> 00:05:50,233
to buy a leftover accessory
for that much money.

113
00:05:50,317 --> 00:05:53,150
Well, I have to admit it--
you never change, kid.

114
00:05:53,233 --> 00:05:54,067
Meanie!

115

[NAOFUMI]
Hmph.

116
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,442
[NAOFUMI] Fix these up
while you're at it.

117
00:06:06,525 --> 00:06:08,150
[ERHARDT]
The made-to-order stuff, huh?

118
00:06:08,233 --> 00:06:11,025
Even if I throw in some
freebie materials for ya,

119
00:06:11,108 --> 00:06:13,192
it'll still cost this much.

120
00:06:15,275 --> 00:06:16,067
[NAOFUMI]
Hey, boss.

121
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:17,233
Huh?

122
00:06:17,317 --> 00:06:18,317
[NAOFUMI]
What do those stars next to Filo

123
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,108
and Raphtalia's
level indicators mean?

124
00:06:21,192 --> 00:06:24,400
[ERHARDT] Oh, you guys are ready
for class upgrades already?

125
00:06:24,483 --> 00:06:25,817
Class upgrades?

126
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:28,108
[ERHARDT] It lets you
increase your level cap.

127
00:06:28,192 --> 00:06:29,650
Only those recognized
by the court

128
00:06:29,733 --> 00:06:32,150
have the option,
but since you are a hero,

129
00:06:32,233 --> 00:06:33,483
it's possible.

130
00:06:33,567 --> 00:06:34,942
When you're
upgrading your class,

131
00:06:35,025 --> 00:06:36,983
that's when you choose
which path you wanna take.

132
00:06:37,067 --> 00:06:40,108
And I had a helluva lot of
trouble deciding on mine.

133
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:46,817
[NAOFUMI] You have to do it
at the dragon hourglass, huh?

134
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:49,733
What kind of upgrade were you
thinking about, Raphtalia?

135
00:06:49,817 --> 00:06:52,983
I'm fine with whatever
you decide, I suppose. Why?

136
00:06:53,067 --> 00:06:54,317
Oh, that won't cut it.

137
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,817
You've gotta decide your
future path by yourself.

138

[RAPHTALIA gasps]

139
00:06:58,483 --> 00:07:01,525
After all the Waves are over,
I'll be going back to my home.

140
00:07:01,608 --> 00:07:02,983
You need to pick something
that'll help you

survive on your own.

why are you going back home?

15 gold pieces per person.

next time we come.

159
00:07:43,442 --> 00:07:45,567
Just be patient.

160
00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:47,858
Fifteen gold pieces, right?

161
00:07:50,317 --> 00:07:54,067
[SISTER 10B] Our apologies.
We have made a mistake.

162
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:55,692
I'm sorry, but we are forbidden

163
00:07:55,775 --> 00:07:58,483
from providing upgrades
to the Shield Hero's team.

164
00:07:58,567 --> 00:08:01,025
But... That's not
what she said...

165
00:08:02,067 --> 00:08:05,025
It's a direct order
from His Majesty.

166
00:08:05,108 --> 00:08:06,275
Tch.

167
00:08:17,483 --> 00:08:18,817
Let's go.

168
00:08:23,275 --> 00:08:24,942
Are you going to sell me?

169
00:08:25,025 --> 00:08:27,150
Never. Don't worry about it.

170
00:08:30,317 --> 00:08:32,942
[SLAVE TRADER]
Huh? Well, if it isn't Sir Hero

171
00:08:33,025 --> 00:08:34,067
back with us again!

172
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:35,817
And how can I help you?

173
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:37,983
Looks like your
business is doing okay.

174
00:08:38,067 --> 00:08:41,567
And it is all thanks to you,
if I may be so blunt.

175
00:08:41,650 --> 00:08:43,025
Yes, your traveling trade

176
00:08:43,108 --> 00:08:44,942
has been extremely
profitable for me

177
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:47,108
as well as you,
thank you so much.

178
00:08:47,192 --> 00:08:48,400
What does that mean?

179
00:08:48,483 --> 00:08:49,817
[SLAVE TRADER]
Your little filolial queen

180
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:52,150
has gained quite the reputation.

181
00:08:52,233 --> 00:08:53,442
Nobles from every corner

182
00:08:53,525 --> 00:08:55,733
of Melromarc are
contacting me to ask

183
00:08:55,817 --> 00:08:57,817
how they can procure
one for themselves.

184
00:08:57,900 --> 00:08:59,567
Quite extraordinary, actually.

185
00:08:59,650 --> 00:09:01,567
--And then there's you...
--[gasps]

186
00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:02,983
You've helped my business

gain a reputation for
providing high-quality slaves.

188
00:09:06,275 --> 00:09:10,025
And the money just doesn't
stop rollin' in! [chuckles]

189
00:09:10,108 --> 00:09:12,983
Anyway, how may I
help you today?

190
00:09:13,067 --> 00:09:14,692
Would ya like another slave?

191
00:09:14,775 --> 00:09:16,192
Or perhaps you need
some assistance

192
00:09:16,275 --> 00:09:18,275
with your filolial experiment?

193
00:09:18,358 --> 00:09:20,733
I'm trying to arrange some
class upgrades for us.

194
00:09:20,817 --> 00:09:21,775
Can ya do that?

195
00:09:21,858 --> 00:09:25,067
[SLAVE TRADER]
Ah... class upgrades...

196
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:27,525
[NAOFUMI] They're refusing to
let us do it in this country.

197
00:09:27,608 --> 00:09:29,192
It's a real pain.

198
00:09:29,275 --> 00:09:32,775
I remember you having a slave
that was over level 40.

199
00:09:36,233 --> 00:09:37,733
[SLAVE TRADER] Er, though
it pains me to say it,

200
00:09:37,817 --> 00:09:39,983
we don't provide
that service here.

201
00:09:40,067 --> 00:09:41,025
[NAOFUMI]
I see.

202
00:09:41,108 --> 00:09:43,108
No reason to despair, however.

203
00:09:43,192 --> 00:09:44,358
You can still get it done

204
00:09:44,442 --> 00:09:46,900
by simply applying
at any other country's

205
00:09:46,983 --> 00:09:48,942
dragon hourglass.

206
00:09:49,025 --> 00:09:50,442
You mean there are others?

207
00:09:50,525 --> 00:09:52,067
[SLAVE TRADER]
Yes, indeed!

208
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:54,817
Ordinarily, I would charge
for valuable information

209
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:57,900
like this, but since
it's you who's asking,

210
00:09:57,983 --> 00:10:00,817
I'll be happy to
tell ya for free.

211
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:02,942
If we're talking
favorable countries

212
00:10:03,025 --> 00:10:05,150
for you to upgrade classes,

213
00:10:05,233 --> 00:10:08,525
there's the Mercenary
Nation Zeltoble,

214
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:11,400
Demi-Human Country Siltvelt,

215
00:10:11,483 --> 00:10:14,442
and Shieldfreeden.

216
00:10:14,525 --> 00:10:16,775
I suggest Shieldfreeden.

217
00:10:16,858 --> 00:10:19,317
Even though it's a
country of demi-humans,

218
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,983
it's surprisingly
welcoming to humans.

219
00:10:22,067 --> 00:10:24,525
So how long is it going
to take to get there?

220
00:10:24,608 --> 00:10:26,317
By ship, it's two weeks.

221
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:29,233
And if you go by wagon,
it's the better part of a month.

222
00:10:29,317 --> 00:10:30,692
That's so far.

223
00:10:30,775 --> 00:10:32,108
Yeah.

224
00:10:32,192 --> 00:10:33,983
We won't be able to get there
before the next Wave.

225
00:10:34,067 --> 00:10:35,233
[SLAVE TRADER]
Then how about making do

226
00:10:35,317 --> 00:10:37,442
this time by equipping
your filolial queen

227
00:10:37,525 --> 00:10:40,192
with a weapon? I may
have just the thing!

228
00:10:40,275 --> 00:10:43,400
Huh? A weapon just for me?

229
00:10:43,483 --> 00:10:47,025
[SLAVE TRADER] Wyvern talons.
Pretty slick, huh?

230
00:10:47,108 --> 00:10:48,900
What's a wyvern?

231
00:10:48,983 --> 00:10:49,983
How much are they?

232
00:10:50,067 --> 00:10:52,233
In light of your
continued patronage,

233
00:10:52,317 --> 00:10:53,733
I'll offer you the exceptional

234
00:10:53,817 --> 00:10:56,858
once-in-a-lifetime price
of five gold pieces.

235
00:10:56,942 --> 00:10:58,650
Make it four.

236
00:10:58,733 --> 00:11:00,817
And how 'bout you
throw in some reins?

237
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:02,275
It's a deal!

238
00:11:02,358 --> 00:11:07,108
You've grown into just the
kind of man I really adore!

239
00:11:07,192 --> 00:11:09,525
You make my spine tingle!

240
00:11:09,608 --> 00:11:10,900
[NAOFUMI]
What's with him?

241
00:11:10,983 --> 00:11:13,025
These things feel kinda weird.

242
00:11:13,108 --> 00:11:15,525
It might take a little while
to get used to them.

243
00:11:15,608 --> 00:11:17,233
Oh, uh, listen.

244
00:11:17,317 --> 00:11:20,108
Can we do some kind of
test on these new talons?

245
00:11:20,192 --> 00:11:22,108
Well, I'm afraid
all the monsters here

246
00:11:22,192 --> 00:11:24,192
are merchandise for sale.

247
00:11:24,275 --> 00:11:25,400
Huh.

248
00:11:25,483 --> 00:11:27,483
Come to think of it...

249
00:11:27,567 --> 00:11:31,025
I may have just the thing
you're looking for!

250
00:11:39,358 --> 00:11:40,858
Yucky!

251
00:11:40,942 --> 00:11:43,150
I've never smelled
anything this bad.

252
00:11:43,233 --> 00:11:46,025
That damned slave
merchant should be here.

253
00:11:48,317 --> 00:11:49,733
What would monsters
be doing here

254
00:11:49,817 --> 00:11:51,817
in the capital's
sewer system anyway?

255
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:53,358
They were probably
dumped in here

256
00:11:53,442 --> 00:11:54,900
after they grew
too big for people

257
00:11:54,983 --> 00:11:56,733
to control them anymore.

258

Are you okay?

00:12:51,858 --> 00:12:52,942
Yes.

276
00:12:53,025 --> 00:12:54,650
It's actually not
so bad since the parts

277
00:12:54,733 --> 00:12:56,858
you bandage heal really fast.

278
00:12:59,192 --> 00:13:01,108
[NAOFUMI]
Ten days until the Wave...

279
00:13:01,192 --> 00:13:03,358
I hope you've recovered by then.

280
00:13:03,442 --> 00:13:04,900
[RAPHTALIA]
Mm-hm.

281
00:13:04,983 --> 00:13:06,233
Since we don't know
when or where

282
00:13:06,317 --> 00:13:07,900
the next Wave will
be coming from,

283
00:13:07,983 --> 00:13:09,317
we're going to have
to be prepared

284
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:10,900
for anything and everything.

285
00:13:10,983 --> 00:13:12,983
And given the
possibility of casualties

286
00:13:13,067 --> 00:13:15,192
in a town or village,
we should stock up

287
00:13:15,275 --> 00:13:17,525
on a ton of medicine.

288
00:13:17,608 --> 00:13:18,900
Not to mention...

289
00:13:18,983 --> 00:13:22,400
We should probably scout out
possible combat zones...

290
00:13:22,483 --> 00:13:24,192
Uh?

291
00:13:24,275 --> 00:13:25,942
Does it hurt?

292
00:13:26,025 --> 00:13:28,983
Once all the Waves
have been repelled,

293
00:13:29,067 --> 00:13:32,358
you'll probably go back--
back to your home world,

294
00:13:32,442 --> 00:13:34,192
and I'll never see you again.

Yes. From what I can tell,

357
00:17:11,192 --> 00:17:13,983
it seems that the local lord
is heavily taxing the citizens,

358
00:17:14,067 --> 00:17:15,650
way beyond the
court's set limits,

359

and he's using that revenue
in a vicious campaign

to suppress dissenters
of any kind

what happened to that country

Yes. Everybody else was killed.

our lives did get a little
better. But not for long.

hiking up the taxes

the exact same thing in mind.
