Now fire!

00:00:40,483 --> 00:00:43,400
The lords of Melromarc
will finally pay attention.

00:00:43,483 --> 00:00:45,067
As you wish.

[MYNE chuckles]

7
00:01:04,358 --> 00:01:06,942
That's no ordinary
forest fire, is it?

8
00:01:07,025 --> 00:01:10,650
Got that right.
I bet Myne's the one behind it.

9
00:01:10,733 --> 00:01:14,108
I guess she thinks
she can smoke us out.

10
00:01:14,192 --> 00:01:15,692
I can't believe she'd...

11
00:01:15,775 --> 00:01:18,442
That fire's gonna make it's
way down the mountain fast.

12
00:01:18,525 --> 00:01:19,567
Let's move.

13
00:01:27,108 --> 00:01:28,567
[PEDDLER 14A]
Checkpoint's been closed,

14
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:31,275
and there's emergency security
forces all along the border.

your change. Huh? Sir?

Have you seen this
man anywhere around here?

Oh! Master's back!

24
00:02:03,067 --> 00:02:05,150
[RAPHTALIA]
How'd it go, Master Naofumi?

25
00:02:05,233 --> 00:02:07,275
We should probably give up
on going to Siltvelt,

26
00:02:07,358 --> 00:02:09,400
for a while, anyway.

27
00:02:09,483 --> 00:02:11,275
Which means that...

28
00:02:11,358 --> 00:02:14,025
Sir Shield Hero,
you are hereby requested

29

to meet with
Her Majesty the Queen.

30
00:02:16,733 --> 00:02:18,817
Is meeting with
the queen our only option,

31
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:21,358
just like the Shadow told us?

32
00:02:21,442 --> 00:02:23,858
Naofumi, what do
you intend to do?

33
00:02:25,817 --> 00:02:27,983
I guess we're off
to meet the queen.

What is it, Melty?

68
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:21,150
Well, I know the nobleman
in charge of this region.

69
00:04:21,233 --> 00:04:22,192
He's a good man.

70
00:04:22,275 --> 00:04:24,275
He might just be
able to help us out.

71
00:04:24,358 --> 00:04:25,775
A nobleman?

72
00:04:25,858 --> 00:04:28,358
[MELTY] These days, humans
treat demi-humans like slaves,

73
00:04:28,442 --> 00:04:30,317
but in the past,
some nobility encouraged

74
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,483
peaceful relations
between the races.

75
00:04:33,567 --> 00:04:36,483
The leader of that group
was a wonderful man.

76
00:04:36,567 --> 00:04:40,067
He was the lord of
the domain of Seyaette.

77
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:42,275
But after he died
in the first Wave,

78
00:04:42,358 --> 00:04:44,233
all the nobles who
had sided with him

79
00:04:44,317 --> 00:04:46,317
were banished
under Father's orders

80
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,858
to the most remote
regions of the kingdom.

81
00:04:49,942 --> 00:04:53,108
What is the king's
problem with demi-humans?

84
00:04:57,817 --> 00:05:02,567
The village my family's from.
It was in the Seyaette district.

85
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:04,317
I heard that
after the first Wave

86
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:07,317
the Seyaette region
was badly hit by rioters.

87
00:05:08,483 --> 00:05:10,567
I'm afraid it was.

88
00:05:14,358 --> 00:05:15,358
[RAPHTALIA]
My village was attacked

89
00:05:15,442 --> 00:05:17,067
by a mob of
Melromarc's soldiers

90
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:19,942
who were totally
out of control.

91
00:05:20,025 --> 00:05:21,650
The more I hear
about these scum,

92
00:05:21,733 --> 00:05:23,775
the more I'm disgusted.

I'm so sorry.

94
00:05:27,775 --> 00:05:30,567
But, Melty, it's not
like it was your fault.

95
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:32,817
[MELTY] As royalty,
there must have been something

96
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:34,650
we could have done.

97
00:05:34,733 --> 00:05:37,192
But we did nothing to help.

98
00:05:37,275 --> 00:05:39,358
Raphtalia, tell me
everything you remember

99
00:05:39,442 --> 00:05:41,067
about those soldiers.

100
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:41,983
Huh?

101
00:05:42,067 --> 00:05:43,275
Once things have
been cleared up,

102
00:05:43,358 --> 00:05:46,525
I'll make sure they're
brought to justice.

103

Thank you.

104
00:05:49,608 --> 00:05:53,775
Okay, so this nobleman that you
know lives around here, right?

105
00:05:53,858 --> 00:05:54,900
[MELTY]
Yes.

106
00:05:54,983 --> 00:05:56,525
The real question
is whether or not

107
00:05:56,608 --> 00:05:58,733
we can actually trust this guy.

108
00:05:58,817 --> 00:06:00,983

You are indeed correct.

109

[RAPHTALIA, FILO, MELTY]
Huh?

110
00:06:10,275 --> 00:06:12,817
It's been too long,
hasn't it, Reichnott?

111

Princess Melty,
it's so good to see you again.

112
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,275
Very pleased to meet you.

00:06:18,358 --> 00:06:20,275
You may call me Van Reichnott.

114
00:06:20,358 --> 00:06:22,942
I am the reigning lord
of this region.

115
00:06:23,025 --> 00:06:26,442
[NAOFUMI] Wait, this wimp is the
nobleman she was talking about?

116
00:06:26,525 --> 00:06:28,233
But his stealth
is off the charts.

117
00:06:28,317 --> 00:06:30,692
How the hell did he do that?

118
00:06:30,775 --> 00:06:32,942
However, this is
no place for a chat.

119
00:06:33,025 --> 00:06:35,650
Why don't you come over
to the house and we'll talk?

120
00:06:38,983 --> 00:06:40,525
[VAN]
I see.

121
00:06:40,608 --> 00:06:44,525
So you reached my domain after
escaping Melromarc's forces,

122
00:06:44,608 --> 00:06:45,942
is that it?

123
00:06:46,025 --> 00:06:47,358
[NAOFUMI]
Yeah.

124
00:06:47,442 --> 00:06:49,317
The knights have informed
me that you were the one

125
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,858
who started the
wildfires in order

126
00:06:50,942 --> 00:06:52,608
to cover your tracks,
Sir Shield Hero.

127
00:06:52,692 --> 00:06:54,858
Would you consider that
account to be accurate?

128
00:06:54,942 --> 00:06:56,733
That's a complete lie.

129
00:06:56,817 --> 00:06:59,900
I can guarantee the other
princess is behind that.

130
00:06:59,983 --> 00:07:01,192
[VAN]
I thought so.

131
00:07:01,275 --> 00:07:03,483
In fact, when I ran into
your party in the woods,

132
00:07:03,567 --> 00:07:05,692
I had been patrolling
the area out of concern

133
00:07:05,775 --> 00:07:07,608
for Princess Melty.

134
00:07:07,692 --> 00:07:09,900
You must be exhausted
from your travels.

135
00:07:09,983 --> 00:07:12,233
You're more than welcome
to rest up here for a while,

136
00:07:12,317 --> 00:07:13,317
if you wish.

137
00:07:15,233 --> 00:07:17,692
[FILO]
Ooh! Wow!

Please, can I eat?

00:07:20,275 --> 00:07:21,067
[NAOFUMI]
No, wait.

140
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:22,317
Huh?

141
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,400
Not till I'm convinced
we can trust this guy.

142
00:07:25,483 --> 00:07:26,692
[VAN]
Mmm!

143
00:07:26,775 --> 00:07:29,442
Absolutely exquisite!

144
00:07:29,525 --> 00:07:32,942
Rest assured,
the food isn't poisoned.

Come on, Master Naofumi,
I'm sure it's safe to eat.

150
00:07:46,025 --> 00:07:48,317
It's incredibly
rude to cast such doubts

151
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,567
on his gracious hospitality.

152
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:53,067
We're not gonna
be here that long.

153
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:56,650
We're leaving tomorrow
morning at dawn.

154
00:07:56,733 --> 00:07:58,025
But why so soon?

155
00:07:58,108 --> 00:08:00,192
[NAOFUMI]
The longer we stay,

156
00:08:00,275 --> 00:08:02,775
the higher the odds of us
being sniffed out.

157
00:08:02,858 --> 00:08:04,775
Well, yes, but I was, ehm...

158
00:08:04,858 --> 00:08:07,608
I was hoping to be able
to rest a little more.

159
00:08:07,692 --> 00:08:09,900
Princess Melty, if you'll
allow me to say so,

160
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:10,900
it appears you've grown.

161
00:08:10,983 --> 00:08:12,150
[MELTY]
Huh?

162
00:08:12,233 --> 00:08:14,567
In the past, you used to
affect a mature attitude

163
00:08:14,650 --> 00:08:16,525
that went beyond your years...

164
00:08:16,608 --> 00:08:18,817
However, since you've been
traveling with the Shield Hero,

165
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:23,567
I'd say it's helped you to grow,
and I mean that in a good way.

166
00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:25,400
[NAOFUMI] I'm pretty sure
you mean it in a bad way.

167
00:08:25,483 --> 00:08:27,275
What?! You keep quiet, you--!

168
00:08:27,358 --> 00:08:28,483
[NAOFUMI]
Quit making such a racket,

169
00:08:28,567 --> 00:08:29,692
we're trying to eat here.

170
00:08:29,775 --> 00:08:31,483
[MELTY] Whose fault
do you think that is?!

171
00:08:31,567 --> 00:08:33,067
[RAPHTALIA sighs]

172
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:34,483
Oh, wow!

173
00:08:34,567 --> 00:08:36,900
This feels amazing!

174
00:08:36,983 --> 00:08:39,775
So soft and bouncy!

175
00:08:41,025 --> 00:08:43,650
You need to get some rest.
Why don't you sleep?

176
00:08:43,733 --> 00:08:44,733
There's no way of knowing

177
00:08:44,817 --> 00:08:46,942
when this place is
gonna be attacked.

178
00:08:47,025 --> 00:08:50,650
I make it a point of not
sleeping at times like these.

179
00:08:50,733 --> 00:08:53,108
Master Naofumi,
why don't I keep watch,

180
00:08:53,192 --> 00:08:56,567
that way you can go ahead
and get some sleep?

181
00:08:56,650 --> 00:08:58,525
All right.

182
00:08:58,608 --> 00:09:00,025
[MELTY]
Wait a minute.

183
00:09:00,108 --> 00:09:02,900
Why do you listen to what
Raphtalia says, but not to me?

184
00:09:02,983 --> 00:09:04,525
[NAOFUMI]
Don't worry about it.

185
00:09:06,817 --> 00:09:08,108
Hey, I know.

186
00:09:08,192 --> 00:09:11,650
You and I can do some
exploring around this place.

187
00:09:11,733 --> 00:09:13,692
Sure. Let's go.

188
00:09:15,817 --> 00:09:18,983
[FILO] I wonder if they have
some yummy snacks anywhere...

189
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:23,400
Would it hurt if you
were a bit nicer to her?

190
00:09:23,483 --> 00:09:26,108
It wouldn't cost
you anything, y'know.

191
00:09:30,817 --> 00:09:32,025
Huh?

192
00:09:34,025 --> 00:09:35,817
[FILO]
What's wrong, Mel?

193
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:37,942
I don't understand why,
but I think I've been acting

194
00:09:38,025 --> 00:09:40,733
really spoiled since
meeting Naofumi.

195
00:09:40,817 --> 00:09:43,942
Even my speech has
become more crude as well.

196
00:09:44,025 --> 00:09:47,733
I feel like a different person,
and I'm not sure I like her.

197
00:09:47,817 --> 00:09:49,483
Well, I, umm...

198
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:52,817
I'm sorry. You don't really
understand me, do you?

199
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:55,275
Well, not exactly,
but I still love you!

200
00:09:55,358 --> 00:09:56,608
Huh?

201
00:09:56,692 --> 00:09:58,650
I mean, you always look
so cheerful and everything

202
00:09:58,733 --> 00:10:01,608
when you're talking to Master,
so I can tell you like him.

203
00:10:01,692 --> 00:10:03,108
Oh, really?

204
00:10:03,192 --> 00:10:05,400
I know, all you have to
do is get him to dote on you

205
00:10:05,483 --> 00:10:07,775
just like he does us.
it's simple!

206
00:10:07,858 --> 00:10:10,150
What...?! Wait, no!

207
00:10:10,233 --> 00:10:11,233
[FILO]
Yep!

208
00:10:11,317 --> 00:10:12,733
But that isn't...
I mean, I don't...

209
00:10:12,817 --> 00:10:15,108
That's not really what
I'm looking for from him!

210
00:10:19,108 --> 00:10:21,442
[AULTCRAY]
You still haven't found her?!

211
00:10:21,525 --> 00:10:22,942
If anything happens to Melty,

212
00:10:23,025 --> 00:10:25,733
I'll have every one of your
miserable heads on a pike!

213
00:10:25,817 --> 00:10:27,483
[KNIGHTS]
Yes, sire!

214
00:10:30,275 --> 00:10:31,733
Rest assured, Father.

215
00:10:31,817 --> 00:10:35,858
I promise you I will find Melty
and bring her back home to us.

216
00:10:35,942 --> 00:10:37,733
Do what you can.

217
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:44,525
This can't happen
to my family again.

218
00:10:44,608 --> 00:10:48,317
How much do you intend
to make me suffer?

219
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:50,358
Accursed Shield!

220
00:10:51,608 --> 00:10:52,942
[MELTY]
You're up?

221
00:10:53,025 --> 00:10:53,900
[NAOFUMI]
Yeah.

222
00:10:53,983 --> 00:10:55,483
I'll take over now.

223
00:10:55,567 --> 00:10:56,733
[MELTY]
It's fine.

224
00:10:56,817 --> 00:10:59,317
I'm really not
very sleepy, actually.

225
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,942
What's the matter?

226
00:11:01,025 --> 00:11:02,650
[MELTY]
Naofumi, I...

227
00:11:02,733 --> 00:11:03,942
What is it?

228
00:11:04,025 --> 00:11:05,775
I was just thinking that,
as a crown princess,

229
00:11:05,858 --> 00:11:08,608
should I really
keep running like this?

230
00:11:08,692 --> 00:11:10,067
As a member of the royal family,

231
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:12,733
there's just so much
more I could be doing.

232
00:11:12,817 --> 00:11:16,775
But I find I'm doing nothing
because I keep running.

233
00:11:16,858 --> 00:11:19,817
[NAOFUMI] You know, your life
comes before anything else.

234
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:22,483
So you can worry about
your duties once you're safe

235
00:11:22,567 --> 00:11:23,817
and out of danger.

236
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:26,858
[MELTY]
But I feel so pathetic.

237
00:11:29,817 --> 00:11:33,775
Don't be so hard on yourself.
Get some rest now.

238
00:11:33,858 --> 00:11:35,150
[MELTY]
Okay.

239
00:11:36,192 --> 00:11:37,608
Don't worry.

240
00:11:37,692 --> 00:11:40,442
I'm sure there are things that
only you can take care of.

241
00:11:41,942 --> 00:11:43,358
[MELTY]
Thanks. Umm...

242
00:11:43,442 --> 00:11:44,192
[NAOFUMI]
Hm?

243
00:11:44,275 --> 00:11:45,233
It's nothing.

244
00:11:45,317 --> 00:11:46,650
Not important.

245
00:11:46,733 --> 00:11:48,108
Goodnight, Naofumi.

246
00:11:48,192 --> 00:11:49,692
Yeah, g'night.

247
00:11:53,567 --> 00:11:58,483
[RAPHTALIA whimpering]

248
00:12:04,442 --> 00:12:07,817
No... Please...
No, please, stop...

249
00:12:20,692 --> 00:12:21,983
[NAOFUMI]
Poor thing.

250
00:12:22,067 --> 00:12:24,817
She's having that
same nightmare again?

251
00:12:32,567 --> 00:12:34,192
[RAPHTALIA]
Rifana!

252
00:12:36,692 --> 00:12:38,650
[NAOFUMI]
You okay?

253
00:12:38,733 --> 00:12:40,858
[RAPHTALIA]
Y-Yes.

254
00:12:40,942 --> 00:12:42,650
[NAOFUMI]
We've got bad news.

255
00:12:42,733 --> 00:12:43,817
[RAPHTALIA]
Huh?

256
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:48,400
[gasps] Why is the
lord being taken away?

257
00:12:48,483 --> 00:12:51,233
Sir Hero, you and your
party have to leave now!

258
00:12:51,317 --> 00:12:52,817
What's going on?

259
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:54,483
[MAID 14A] A nobleman from
the next town over marched

260
00:12:54,567 --> 00:12:57,025
right in here and
accused us of hiding you!

261
00:12:57,108 --> 00:12:58,192
[BOTH gasp]

262
00:12:58,275 --> 00:12:59,942
Go find that
Devil of the Shield!

263
00:13:00,025 --> 00:13:02,067
The kitchen is the
only safe way out.

264
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:04,025
Where're Filo and Melty?

265
00:13:04,108 --> 00:13:05,275
What do you have to report?

266
00:13:05,358 --> 00:13:07,567
He's not anywhere around, sir.

267
00:13:07,650 --> 00:13:09,608
This way, quickly.

268
00:13:11,442 --> 00:13:12,900
[SOLDIER 14C]
Hey, you there!

269
00:13:12,983 --> 00:13:14,400
What are you doing?

270
00:13:14,483 --> 00:13:15,900
[MAID 14A]
I'm preparing lunch.

271
00:13:15,983 --> 00:13:16,858
Well forget that!

272
00:13:16,942 --> 00:13:18,108
C'mere!

273
00:13:19,108 --> 00:13:21,192
[MELTY]
What do you think you're doing?

274
00:13:21,275 --> 00:13:24,358
I am Melty Melromarc,
Second Princess of Melromarc.

275
00:13:24,442 --> 00:13:26,233
Let her go right now!

276
00:13:26,317 --> 00:13:29,525
I command you two
to stop this right away!

277
00:13:29,608 --> 00:13:30,775
What should we do?

278
00:13:30,858 --> 00:13:32,317
I'm not sure.

279
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:35,900
[IDOL] My, my,
if it isn't Princess Melty.

280
00:13:35,983 --> 00:13:37,067
[gasps]

281
00:13:42,275 --> 00:13:43,608
[MELTY]
Aren't you...?

282
00:13:45,692 --> 00:13:46,775
[gasps]

283
00:13:46,858 --> 00:13:49,358
[NAOFUMI]
Let's wait and see what happens.

284
00:13:49,442 --> 00:13:51,525
I'm so glad to see
you're all right.

285
00:13:51,608 --> 00:13:54,900
I rushed right over here because
I was worried for your safety.

286
00:13:54,983 --> 00:13:56,608
Idol Rabier.

287
00:13:56,692 --> 00:13:59,233
I heard rumors that in the
past you'd had disagreements

288
00:13:59,317 --> 00:14:00,483
with my father.

289
00:14:00,567 --> 00:14:01,692
True.

290
00:14:01,775 --> 00:14:04,233
May I assume that these
soldiers are with you?

291
00:14:04,317 --> 00:14:05,817
They are indeed.

292
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:08,650
[MELTY] Then have them withdraw
from these premises immediately.

293
00:14:08,733 --> 00:14:10,108
Before I do
something like that,

294
00:14:10,192 --> 00:14:12,817
tell me where the Devil
of the Shield is hiding.

295
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:15,942
All I can tell you is that
the Shield Hero is gone.

296
00:14:16,025 --> 00:14:16,942
Really?

297
00:14:17,025 --> 00:14:19,067
I encouraged him to escape.

298
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:21,192
There's no way your men
will ever catch him.

299
00:14:21,275 --> 00:14:22,817
He's too far away.

300
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:24,192
That girl...

301
00:14:24,275 --> 00:14:27,275
I intend to tell
my father everything.

302
00:14:27,358 --> 00:14:29,275
And I will do
everything in my power

303
00:14:29,358 --> 00:14:32,108
to clear the
Shield Hero's good name!

304
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:37,275
[MELTY] Now, you will take me to
the capital as soon as possible.

305
00:14:37,358 --> 00:14:39,483
Oh, I understand perfectly.

306
00:14:39,567 --> 00:14:42,025
I'll make arrangements for
your journey at my mansion.

307
00:14:42,108 --> 00:14:43,817
You'll be more
comfortable there.

308
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:45,733
All right, take her.

309
00:14:54,525 --> 00:14:55,900
[NAOFUMI]
Calm down.

310
00:14:55,983 --> 00:14:58,775
Don't ruin what
Melty's trying to do.

311
00:15:05,025 --> 00:15:06,650
Filo! You can come out now!

312
00:15:06,733 --> 00:15:08,567
Filo, it's us!

313
00:15:08,650 --> 00:15:12,483
[MAID 14A]
Filo! Where are you?

314
00:15:12,567 --> 00:15:15,692
Oh, to hell with it.

315
00:15:15,775 --> 00:15:16,817
Filo!

316
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:18,108
Get out here now!

317
00:15:18,192 --> 00:15:19,983
This is an order!

318
00:15:20,067 --> 00:15:22,317
[FILO]
Ow!

319
00:15:24,567 --> 00:15:27,567
Ow! Why are you being
such a meanie, Master?!

320
00:15:27,650 --> 00:15:30,067
It's your fault for
not coming when I call.

321
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:33,817
And do you mind telling me what
you were even doing up here?

322
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:35,775
[FILO] Mel wanted
to play hide and seek.

323
00:15:35,858 --> 00:15:38,150
We weren't doing anything wrong.

324
00:15:38,233 --> 00:15:40,442
She said it was really important
I should hide somewhere

325
00:15:40,525 --> 00:15:44,358
I wouldn't be found and not
to come out, no matter what.

326
00:15:44,442 --> 00:15:47,900
But then she never
actually came to find me.

327
00:15:47,983 --> 00:15:48,983
Wait a sec.

328
00:15:49,067 --> 00:15:50,733
Where's Mel?

329
00:15:52,192 --> 00:15:53,942
[FILO]
I'm going to save her!

330
00:15:54,025 --> 00:15:55,150
[RAPHTALIA]
Filo, no, wait!

331
00:15:55,233 --> 00:15:56,192
We have to get going,

332
00:15:56,275 --> 00:15:57,817
if we don't hurry up,
then she'll...

333
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:00,900
[NAOFUMI] Abandoning her
and running away is an option.

334
00:16:00,983 --> 00:16:02,692
I admit that.

335
00:16:04,608 --> 00:16:07,692
And yet, she never
stopped believing in me.

336
00:16:14,192 --> 00:16:16,150
So now...

337
00:16:16,233 --> 00:16:18,900
I refuse to betray her trust.

338
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:21,983
I made her a promise.

339
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:44,942
I guess you know that Idol scum.

340
00:16:45,025 --> 00:16:46,858
He's the one
in your nightmares?

341
00:16:46,942 --> 00:16:48,192
Yes.

342
00:16:48,275 --> 00:16:49,483
You can stay
behind if you want.

343
00:16:49,567 --> 00:16:51,025
You don't have to come.

344
00:16:51,108 --> 00:16:52,317
No, I'm fine.

345
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:55,942
I'm not afraid anymore
now that I have my sword.

346
00:16:56,025 --> 00:16:58,817
I'm ready to face my past.

347
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:01,067
I know whatcha mean.

348
00:17:02,358 --> 00:17:04,317
[DEMI-HUMAN 14A]
Open the gate!

349
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,525
[FILO]
What's going on?

350
00:17:05,608 --> 00:17:06,817
[RAPHTALIA]
Demi-humans who love their lord

351
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,650
must've come here for him.

352
00:17:08,733 --> 00:17:10,567
[DEMI-HUMAN 14B]
Return Lord Van!

353
00:17:10,650 --> 00:17:12,150
Well, that's convenient.

354
00:17:12,233 --> 00:17:14,483
We'll sneak into the mansion
while they distract the guards.

355
00:17:14,567 --> 00:17:15,525
Let's go.

356
00:17:15,608 --> 00:17:17,567
--Right!
--'Kay!

357
00:17:23,775 --> 00:17:26,983
[IDOL]
Ugh, look at those damned demis!

358
00:17:27,067 --> 00:17:29,900
What are they doing out there?
Why are they protesting?

359
00:17:29,983 --> 00:17:32,400
[IDOL] Just some annoying
flies buzzing around.

360
00:17:32,483 --> 00:17:34,025
Nothing to worry about.

361
00:17:34,108 --> 00:17:36,442
We'll get rid of them at once.

362
00:17:36,525 --> 00:17:38,817
And since we're mentioning
annoyances, my dear.

363
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:39,983
I believe it's time to tell me

364
00:17:40,067 --> 00:17:41,942
where the Devil
of the Shield is!

365
00:17:42,025 --> 00:17:44,025
I've already told
you several times.

366
00:17:44,108 --> 00:17:45,983
I do not know.

367
00:17:46,067 --> 00:17:47,192
[MELTY gasps]

368
00:17:50,192 --> 00:17:51,650
[MELTY]
Reichnott?!

369
00:17:55,108 --> 00:17:56,983
[IDOL] Where is
the Devil of the Shield?

370
00:17:57,067 --> 00:18:00,025
I have no idea who
you're speaking of.

371
00:18:00,108 --> 00:18:02,192
I-- The only shield
I've ever heard of

372
00:18:02,275 --> 00:18:04,025
is called the Shield Hero.

373
00:18:04,108 --> 00:18:05,650
[thud]

374
00:18:05,733 --> 00:18:07,942
As you can see, we're having
a bit of a difficult time

375
00:18:08,025 --> 00:18:09,567
getting him to cooperate.

376
00:18:09,650 --> 00:18:12,192
I would very much like to
avoid getting rough with you

377
00:18:12,275 --> 00:18:15,525
if that's at all possible.

378
00:18:15,608 --> 00:18:18,067
But as a humble
servant of God, my dear,

379
00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:20,858
I have taken a sacred vow
to punish anyone who sides

380
00:18:20,942 --> 00:18:22,775
with the Devil.

381
00:18:22,858 --> 00:18:26,608
That is my holy duty,
dear princess.

382
00:18:28,858 --> 00:18:29,608
[SOLDIER 14E]
Intruders!

383
00:18:29,692 --> 00:18:31,567
Over there!

384
00:18:31,650 --> 00:18:33,483
[NAOFUMI]
Filo, time to go wild.

385
00:18:33,567 --> 00:18:36,108
We'll go rescue Melty while you
take care of those soldiers.

386
00:18:36,192 --> 00:18:37,150
[FILO]
Mm!

387
00:18:37,233 --> 00:18:38,942
[RAPHTALIA yells]

388
00:18:43,192 --> 00:18:44,942
[SOLDIER 14I]
After them!

389
00:18:59,983 --> 00:19:02,942
[FILO]
Mel!

390
00:19:11,733 --> 00:19:14,358
[NAOFUMI]
Raphtalia, what's down there?

391
00:19:16,983 --> 00:19:19,525
Our priority right now
is rescuing Melty.

392
00:19:19,608 --> 00:19:22,650
--We can come back later.
--[RAPHTALIA] Okay.

393
00:19:22,733 --> 00:19:24,567
[SOLDIER 14L]
I found them! Over there!

394
00:19:32,733 --> 00:19:34,775
That is highly potent venom.

395
00:19:34,858 --> 00:19:38,025
If you don't take the
antidote soon, you'll die.

396
00:19:38,108 --> 00:19:39,692
But I'm willing to give
you a chance to live

397
00:19:39,775 --> 00:19:42,692
if you answer one question.

398
00:19:42,775 --> 00:19:44,650
Where is Melty?

399
00:19:47,525 --> 00:19:49,358
Stay away!

400
00:19:49,442 --> 00:19:51,525
I truly adore this part!

401
00:19:51,608 --> 00:19:53,650
That valiant look in your eye!

402
00:19:53,733 --> 00:19:56,567
I want to see it become despair,

403
00:19:56,650 --> 00:19:59,692
and watch as your
face warps in agony.

404
00:19:59,775 --> 00:20:02,483
Come on, let me have
a good look at you!

405
00:20:06,108 --> 00:20:08,650
Now what the hell
is going on out there?!

406
00:20:08,733 --> 00:20:09,900
Idol, sir!

407
00:20:09,983 --> 00:20:11,525
The Devil of the Shield
has entered the mansion!

408
00:20:11,608 --> 00:20:12,692
Huh?

409
00:20:12,775 --> 00:20:14,275
He's done what?!

410
00:20:18,692 --> 00:20:19,733
Mel, are you all right?!

411
00:20:19,817 --> 00:20:22,483
I'm okay, Filo! Raphtalia!

412
00:20:23,608 --> 00:20:25,025
Don't you dare!

413
00:20:25,108 --> 00:20:27,067
Take one step and I'll have
the pleasure of making sure

414
00:20:27,150 --> 00:20:29,692
the princess's head will
roll all the way home.

415
00:20:29,775 --> 00:20:32,650
[NAOFUMI] Oh, so we just have
to stand still, is that it?

416
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:36,400
[NAOFUMI]
Air Strike Shield!

417
00:20:44,817 --> 00:20:46,442
Naofumi!

418
00:20:52,983 --> 00:20:54,483
Why did you come back?

419
00:20:54,567 --> 00:20:55,817
[NAOFUMI] Because I've
never heard of a hero

420
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:59,025
who abandons a child
to save his own skin.

421
00:20:59,108 --> 00:21:02,067
You realize that you've
wasted all my hard work.

422
00:21:02,150 --> 00:21:03,275
[sighs]

423
00:21:03,358 --> 00:21:04,942
[MELTY]
But...

424
00:21:05,025 --> 00:21:06,567
Thank you.

425
00:21:08,108 --> 00:21:10,525
You dare make a mockery of me?

426
00:21:10,608 --> 00:21:14,275
Torture clearly isn't
enough for the likes of you!

427
00:21:14,358 --> 00:21:17,233
Your insolence can only
be paid for with death!

428
00:21:32,733 --> 00:21:33,900
Raphtalia!

429
00:21:33,983 --> 00:21:34,775
[NAOFUMI]
Wait.

430
00:21:34,858 --> 00:21:36,025
Huh?

431
00:21:38,275 --> 00:21:41,150
You miserable, worthless demi!

432
00:21:47,775 --> 00:21:49,400
[BOTH gasp]

433
00:21:52,942 --> 00:21:54,567
I beg you... [whimpers]

434
00:21:54,650 --> 00:21:56,317
No, please!

435
00:21:58,608 --> 00:22:01,400
Spare my life,
I'll give you anything!

436
00:22:02,858 --> 00:22:05,275
[RAPHTALIA] So many demi-humans
begged for their lives

437
00:22:05,358 --> 00:22:07,483
just like that, but...

438
00:22:08,858 --> 00:22:10,733
...it wasn't enough!
