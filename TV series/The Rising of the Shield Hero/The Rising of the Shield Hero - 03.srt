Wait!

00:00:16,192 --> 00:00:18,233
[NAOFUMI] It's been a week since
the battle in the coal mine.

3
00:00:18,317 --> 00:00:19,858
[RAPHTALIA]
Come back here!

4
00:00:24,817 --> 00:00:27,150
[NOAFUMI] And my shield's gained
so many skills and abilities

5
00:00:27,233 --> 00:00:29,900
that I've practically
lost count of them all.

6
00:00:29,983 --> 00:00:33,650
But I still let my guard
down, and I got hurt.

00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:54,108
[NAOFUMI]
The Wave is almost here.

11
00:00:54,192 --> 00:00:56,900
It's about time we
upgraded our equipment.

12
00:00:56,983 --> 00:00:59,067
[RAPHTALIA]
Master Naofumi!

13
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:00,775

Wow, I hardly recognized you!

[NAOFUMI]
Hm?

[ERHARDT]
I haven't seen you in a while.

What've you been up to?

45
00:02:45,567 --> 00:02:48,817
I finally learned correct table
manners from the innkeeper.

46
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:52,108
I want to eat my food properly,
like Master Naofumi does.

[ERHARDT]
Is that so, huh?

00:02:53,567 --> 00:02:54,942
You have really grown up.

49
00:02:55,025 --> 00:02:56,942
Nothing like the
pipsqueak you used to be.

Huh?

00:03:02,483 --> 00:03:06,608
Well... someone's a little
hard to please, aren't they?

54
00:03:06,692 --> 00:03:09,108
I'm actually pretty
surprised myself.

55
00:03:09,192 --> 00:03:12,067
This whole country's
full of lolicons.

Wow! Miss, you're adorable.
Have another on the house.

57
00:03:17,233 --> 00:03:19,150
[NAOFUMI] I can understand
finding little girls cute,

58
00:03:19,233 --> 00:03:20,608
but jeez...

59
00:03:21,733 --> 00:03:23,108
Take this, too.

60
00:03:23,192 --> 00:03:25,067
Um, I'm really, uhh...

61
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:28,317
[NAOFUMI]
You people take it too far.

62
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,192
All right, kid, listen.

63
00:03:30,275 --> 00:03:33,067
Haven't you heard the stories
about what demi-humans are like?

64
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:34,275
[RAPHTALIA]
Excuse me!

65
00:03:34,358 --> 00:03:35,983
Can we forget about
all that stuff?

66
00:03:36,067 --> 00:03:38,483
We're here to buy armor
for Master Naofumi!

67
00:03:38,567 --> 00:03:40,858
You have some
recommendations, don't you?!

68
00:03:40,942 --> 00:03:42,900
[NAOFUMI]
What are you talking about?

69
00:03:42,983 --> 00:03:44,525
We're here for your equipment.

70
00:03:44,608 --> 00:03:46,483
I appreciate the thought,
Master Naofumi,

71
00:03:46,567 --> 00:03:49,358
but it's time you protected
yourself first for once!

72
00:03:49,442 --> 00:03:52,108
You just got hurt in the plains,
or did you forget that?

73
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:54,483
Of course I haven't forgotten,
but you need a weapon as we--

74
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:55,942
[RAPHTALIA]
Master Naofumi.

75
00:03:56,025 --> 00:04:01,275
Stop messing around with
your life... or you will die.

76
00:04:03,942 --> 00:04:06,692
[RAPHTALIA] Boss, this sword
seems really sharp!

77
00:04:06,775 --> 00:04:09,817
Yep, that's magic iron.
D'ya feel like trying it out?

78
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:11,900
[RAPHTALIA] What kind of
discount can you give us?

79
00:04:11,983 --> 00:04:14,442
[ERHARDT] Oh, don't worry about
that, miss--anything for you.

80
00:04:14,525 --> 00:04:15,983
--Huh?
--[RAPHTALIA giggles]

81
00:04:16,067 --> 00:04:17,567
[RAPHTALIA]
Thank you so much!

82
00:04:17,650 --> 00:04:20,025
While we're at it, could you
show us some armor, too?

83
00:04:20,108 --> 00:04:21,983
[ERHARDT]
Of course.

84
00:04:22,067 --> 00:04:24,275
[NAOFUMI] She sure
stands up for herself now.

85
00:04:24,358 --> 00:04:27,275
Or maybe she's just rude...

86
00:04:27,358 --> 00:04:30,608
[RAPHTALIA] The most we can
pay is around 180 silvers.

87
00:04:30,692 --> 00:04:32,192
Well, in that case...

88
00:04:33,525 --> 00:04:35,775
[ERHARDT]
How 'bout something like this?

89
00:04:35,858 --> 00:04:38,900
It's not really
my style actually.

90
00:04:38,983 --> 00:04:43,692
Umm... It'll take away all of
Master Naofumi's individuality.

91
00:04:43,775 --> 00:04:45,108
[ERHARDT]
No problem.

92
00:04:45,192 --> 00:04:47,858
I can whip up something
special that's made to order.

93
00:04:47,942 --> 00:04:49,275
Made up special?!

94
00:04:49,358 --> 00:04:50,358
[ERHARDT]
If you don't mind me using

95
00:04:50,442 --> 00:04:51,900
whatever materials
I've got on hand,

96
00:04:51,983 --> 00:04:53,483
I can finish by tomorrow.

97
00:04:53,567 --> 00:04:55,650
[RAPHTALIA]
Please. Please do!

98
00:04:56,692 --> 00:04:57,983
[RAPHTALIA]
Wasn't it nice of him to give us

99
00:04:58,067 --> 00:04:59,775
a discount on this sword?

100
00:04:59,858 --> 00:05:01,192
[NAOFUMI]
Uh-huh.

101
00:05:01,275 --> 00:05:03,483
[RAPHTALIA] He was so sweet
to help us like that.

102
00:05:03,567 --> 00:05:05,317
Don't you think?

103
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,733
I'm not convinced.

[stomach growls]

105
00:05:08,442 --> 00:05:10,233
That wasn't me, I swear it!

00:05:10,317 --> 00:05:12,067
It was me.

[WAITER 3A]
Are you ready to order?

108
00:05:13,525 --> 00:05:15,983
I'll have the cheapest
lunch set that you got,

109
00:05:16,067 --> 00:05:17,733
and she's gonna have
the childrens' lunch set.

110
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:19,275
Master Naofumi!

111
00:05:19,358 --> 00:05:21,567
I'm not a kid anymore and that's
the last I wanna hear of it!

112
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:24,400
So I'll get the cheapest lunch
set, too, and make it quick!

113
00:05:24,483 --> 00:05:26,025
[WAITER 3A]
R-Right away.

114
00:05:26,108 --> 00:05:28,692
You really don't need to
force yourself to act grown-up.

115
00:05:28,775 --> 00:05:31,233
Uh. I'm not forcing it!

116
00:05:33,525 --> 00:05:36,442
[NAOFUMI] Doesn't this make me
look like a typical villain?

117

[RAPHTALIA]
So cool...

118
00:05:38,192 --> 00:05:40,608
It's really perfect!
You look amazing!

119
00:05:40,692 --> 00:05:43,108
[ERHARDT]
I call it Barbarian Armor!

120
00:05:43,192 --> 00:05:46,067
You rock, kid. You look
like a real bandit.

121
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:48,900
Ugh. I'm supposed to
be a hero, you know.

122
00:05:48,983 --> 00:05:50,317
It's dashing!

123
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,275
[NAOFUMI]
Well, you did make it for me.

124
00:05:52,358 --> 00:05:54,067
It'd be a shame
not to wear it...

[ERHARDT, RAPHTALIA]
Hm?

127
00:06:07,483 --> 00:06:10,567
[RAPHTALIA] It's clear that
everyone in town is on edge now.

[NAOFUMI]
Sure, the Wave's nearly here.

129

If only I knew when and where
the damn thing was gonna begin,

130
00:06:15,775 --> 00:06:17,942
I could come up with
some kind of plan.

131
00:06:18,025 --> 00:06:19,317
I can't believe it.

anything about the clock?

--[NAOFUMI] Hm?
--[RAPHTALIA] Huh?

[ERHARDT] You know that church
you can see from town square?

135
00:06:26,317 --> 00:06:28,942
There's a huge hourglass inside.

136
00:06:29,025 --> 00:06:31,150
When the last grain
of sand inside it falls,

137
00:06:31,233 --> 00:06:32,733
the heroes and their
parties will be sent

138
00:06:32,817 --> 00:06:34,567
to wherever the Wave begins.

139
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:36,400
Least, that's what I hear.

140
00:06:39,483 --> 00:06:41,025
Come this way.

[NAOFUMI gasps]

142
00:06:47,483 --> 00:06:50,025
[NAOFUMI] Whoa! Could this
be the dragon hourglass

143
00:06:50,108 --> 00:06:52,317
the king was talking about?

[gasps]

145
00:07:00,483 --> 00:07:04,067
[NAOFUMI] Is it-- Is it really
counting down to the Wave?

146

[MOTOYASU]
Is that Naofumi I see?

147

[MOTOYASU]
Hey! What's this?

148

You're not still fighting with
that flimsy equipment, are you?

149
00:07:15,942 --> 00:07:19,108
Do you know who these
people are, Master Naofumi?

You gave me medicines

You allowed me to
have warm meals.

And most importantly...

00:18:02,567 --> 00:18:05,108
[NAOFUMI] Listen up!
We're gonna buy you time!

314
00:18:05,192 --> 00:18:08,108
Use it to get into formation!

315
00:18:08,192 --> 00:18:10,525
Raphtalia. Take off!

316
00:18:10,608 --> 00:18:11,608
Got it!

317
00:18:21,067 --> 00:18:22,900
[NAOFUMI yells]

318
00:18:22,983 --> 00:18:24,858
[RAPHTALIA yells]

319
00:18:26,358 --> 00:18:27,983
[CAPTAIN 3A]
Let the Shield handle this.

320
00:18:28,067 --> 00:18:31,025
We'll offer reinforcement
to the Three Heroes!

321
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:36,025
All right, go!

322
00:18:37,108 --> 00:18:38,942
[DEPUTY CAPTAIN 3A grunts]

323
00:18:39,025 --> 00:18:42,567
Phalanx formation to
support the Shield Hero!

324
00:18:42,650 --> 00:18:43,775
[ALL gasp]

325
00:18:43,858 --> 00:18:45,775
[KNIGHTS]
Phalanx formation!

326
00:18:45,858 --> 00:18:46,775
To battle!

327
00:18:46,858 --> 00:18:49,317
[KNIGHTS yelling]

328
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:53,067
[RAPHTALIA] Master Naofumi,
look at the knights.

329
00:18:53,150 --> 00:18:55,442
Idiots! Forget 'em, let's go.

330
00:18:58,525 --> 00:19:00,692
Wind Arrow!

331
00:19:00,775 --> 00:19:02,233
Crimson Blade!

332
00:19:03,650 --> 00:19:05,150
[MOTOYASU]
I'll end this!

333
00:19:06,192 --> 00:19:10,567
Take this! Lightning Spear!

334
00:19:13,150 --> 00:19:16,442
Master Naofumi, the sky!

335
00:19:22,608 --> 00:19:24,525
[MOTOYASU]
A walk in the park.

336
00:19:24,608 --> 00:19:26,608
[REN]
This Wave was a piece of cake.

337
00:19:26,692 --> 00:19:27,817
[ITSUKI]
Yep.

338
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:30,567
And the next one'll
probably be easy, too.

339
00:19:30,650 --> 00:19:32,775
[MOTOYASU] By the way,
anybody seen Naofumi?

340
00:19:32,858 --> 00:19:34,150
I'm glad he wasn't here.

341
00:19:34,233 --> 00:19:35,192
He would've held us back

342
00:19:35,275 --> 00:19:36,692
and we wouldn't have
had as much fun!

343
00:19:36,775 --> 00:19:37,775
[MOTOYASU laughs]

344
00:19:37,858 --> 00:19:38,983
For sure!

345
00:19:39,067 --> 00:19:39,983
[CAPTAIN 3A]
Heroes!

346
00:19:40,067 --> 00:19:41,525
[BOTH]
Huh?

347
00:19:43,775 --> 00:19:45,108
Job well done!

348
00:19:45,192 --> 00:19:46,733
The knights, huh?

349
00:19:46,817 --> 00:19:48,775
Isn't it a bit late to show up?

350
00:19:48,858 --> 00:19:50,525
[ITSUKI]
Thanks for the help.

351
00:19:50,608 --> 00:19:53,692
[CAPTAIN 3A]
Now, now, don't be that way.

352
00:19:53,775 --> 00:19:56,567
His Highness has rewards
for each one of you.

353
00:19:56,650 --> 00:19:59,192
So... shall we go?

354
00:20:06,067 --> 00:20:12,025
[VILLAGERS chattering]

355
00:20:25,442 --> 00:20:27,317
[RAPHTALIA]
Master Naofumi.

356
00:20:28,567 --> 00:20:32,650
There aren't any more monsters
here. I killed them all.

357
00:20:32,733 --> 00:20:34,900
That's good.

358
00:20:34,983 --> 00:20:37,358
I guess it is.

359
00:20:37,442 --> 00:20:39,358
But did we win?

360
00:20:41,192 --> 00:20:42,483
[LORD 3A]
Sir Hero.

361
00:20:42,567 --> 00:20:43,733
[NAOFUMI]
Hm?

362
00:20:45,275 --> 00:20:47,775
[LORD 3A]
Thank you very much.

363
00:20:47,858 --> 00:20:49,192
Please accept our gratitude.

364
00:20:49,275 --> 00:20:50,817
There's no way we
could've survived

365
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:52,983
without your help and courage.

366
00:20:54,942 --> 00:20:57,192
Well, it wasn't me.
We were lucky.

367
00:20:57,275 --> 00:20:59,817
[VILLAGER 3A]
No, if you hadn't been here,

368
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:01,025
we would never have been able

369
00:21:01,108 --> 00:21:03,817
to push those monsters
back all on our own.

370
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:06,775
We'll never forget
what you've done for us.

371
00:21:06,858 --> 00:21:08,525
Yeah, whatever...

372
00:21:17,233 --> 00:21:19,400
[RAPHTALIA]
They looked truly grateful.

373
00:21:21,025 --> 00:21:22,650
[NAOFUMI]
I guess.

374
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:26,900
Well, one thing's
for sure at least.

375
00:21:28,108 --> 00:21:31,150
We did save some kids from
going through what I did.

376
00:21:32,483 --> 00:21:34,025
[NAOFUMI]
Yeah.

377
00:21:34,108 --> 00:21:36,025
[RAPHTALIA]
Master Naofumi.

378
00:21:37,275 --> 00:21:40,025
Good job today, Raphtalia.

379
00:21:40,108 --> 00:21:44,275
[RAPHTALIA]
I killed... so many monsters.

380
00:21:44,358 --> 00:21:45,650
[NAOFUMI]
Yeah.

381
00:21:48,108 --> 00:21:49,275
[gasps]
