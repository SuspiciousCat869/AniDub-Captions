[RAPHTALIA]
According to the slave merchant,

00:02:39,192 --> 00:02:42,108
filolials have a king or
queen leading each flock.

46

That's what he told us, anyway.

00:02:44,567 --> 00:02:46,983
[ERHARDT]
I thought that was just a myth.

48
00:02:47,067 --> 00:02:48,775
[RAPHTALIA] Those kings and
queens are highly skilled

49
00:02:48,858 --> 00:02:50,983
at transforming, and they
blend into the flocks

50
00:02:51,067 --> 00:02:54,483
by disguising themselves
as normal filolials.

51
00:02:54,567 --> 00:02:58,067
[ERHARDT] And they can transform
themselves into humans, too?

00:02:58,150 --> 00:02:59,692
That's nuts.

53
00:02:59,775 --> 00:03:02,192

out they need a special crest

[FILO groans, whines]

473
00:20:47,817 --> 00:20:50,650
Doing this is making
me feel so tired.

474
00:20:50,733 --> 00:20:52,025
Don't worry, my dear,

475
00:20:52,108 --> 00:20:54,317
it's only because your mana
is turning into thread.

476
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,400
Endure it for just
a while longer.

477
00:20:56,483 --> 00:20:57,983
What?

478
00:20:58,067 --> 00:21:00,233
[RAPHTALIA] I'll give you some
nice snacks once you finish.

479
00:21:00,317 --> 00:21:01,400
[FILO]
Yummy ones?

480
00:21:01,483 --> 00:21:03,233
Then I'll keep going!

481
00:21:17,025 --> 00:21:18,442
Oh!

482
00:21:18,525 --> 00:21:19,483
[RAPHTALIA groans]

483
00:21:19,567 --> 00:21:21,650
Well, how do I look? All right?

484
00:21:21,733 --> 00:21:23,192
You look terrific.

485
00:21:23,275 --> 00:21:26,733
[FILO]
Yay! Thank you, Master!

486
00:21:26,817 --> 00:21:29,150
I mean, sure, she looks
cute and everything--

487
00:21:29,233 --> 00:21:30,733
--She's darling!
--[NAOFUMI] Huh?

488
00:21:30,817 --> 00:21:32,983
I did my very best to
bring out every last bit

489
00:21:33,067 --> 00:21:37,192
of Filo's angelic charm and
I think I did a hell of a job!

490
00:21:37,275 --> 00:21:39,817
I used white as the base color,
to go with her wings,

491
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:43,067
and I added plenty of frills
as a nod to her feathers, too.

492
00:21:43,150 --> 00:21:45,983
And since it would contrast best
with her lovely blonde hair,

493
00:21:46,067 --> 00:21:48,358
I went with blue for
the ribbon, as you can see.

494
00:21:48,442 --> 00:21:50,025
Sure, right.

495
00:21:50,108 --> 00:21:52,358
Well now, that magic outfit
and the monster crest

496
00:21:52,442 --> 00:21:55,900
add up to, um...
340 silvers, I guess.

497
00:21:55,983 --> 00:21:57,692
You're gonna have to
work hard to pay it off.

498
00:21:57,775 --> 00:22:00,775
Yay! I'll do my best!

499
00:22:00,858 --> 00:22:04,317
[RAPHTALIA gasps] Don't
suddenly transform indoors!

500
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,692
Huh?

501
00:22:05,775 --> 00:22:09,275
[DRESSMAKER squeals]
Even on a monster, it's cute!

502
00:22:09,358 --> 00:22:11,692
--[NAOFUMI gasps]
--I'm sure you agree, don't you?

503
00:22:11,775 --> 00:22:13,525
Isn't your daughter
cute as a button?!

504
00:22:13,608 --> 00:22:15,442
[NAOFUMI]
She's not my daughter!
