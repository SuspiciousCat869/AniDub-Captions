00:08:43,358 --> 00:08:46,150
Just thinking about it
makes me sick!

166
00:08:57,233 --> 00:08:58,692
All right.

167
00:08:59,983 --> 00:09:01,733
[IDOL]
You're boring me!

168
00:09:01,817 --> 00:09:04,358
Scream! Cry!

169
00:09:08,442 --> 00:09:11,067
--[whipping]
--[RIFANA crying]

170
00:09:13,942 --> 00:09:15,775
[IDOL]
Yes. Yes, that's it!

171
00:09:15,858 --> 00:09:18,567
Cry! Cry! More! More!

172
00:09:18,650 --> 00:09:20,650
[RAPHTALIA]
Rifana...

173
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:30,275
[RAPHTALIA]
Come on, Rifana, eat something.

174
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,942
[RAPHTALIA]
Don't worry.

175
00:09:35,025 --> 00:09:37,900
I'm sure the Shield Hero
will save us.

176
00:09:43,192 --> 00:09:47,275
[RIFANA coughs]

177
00:09:49,233 --> 00:09:51,025
Rifana, are you--?

178
00:09:53,025 --> 00:09:56,233
[RAPHTALIA gasps]
You're burning up!

179
00:09:56,317 --> 00:09:57,817
No, wait.

180
00:09:57,900 --> 00:10:00,192
Remember our village flag?

181
00:10:00,275 --> 00:10:01,400
Over the square?

182
00:10:01,483 --> 00:10:02,983
[RAPHTALIA]
Huh?

183
00:10:03,067 --> 00:10:04,817
We demi-humans...

184
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:06,400
It was a symbol
of how we're allowed

185
00:10:06,483 --> 00:10:09,067
to build a village
for ourselves.

186
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:11,525
Uh-huh. Remember?

187
00:10:11,608 --> 00:10:14,233
Sure I remember!

188
00:10:14,317 --> 00:10:16,733
[RIFANA]
I wanna see it again.

189
00:10:16,817 --> 00:10:17,983
And you will!

190
00:10:18,067 --> 00:10:19,775
I promise you.

191
00:10:29,733 --> 00:10:31,692
[RIFANA]
Raphtalia...

192
00:10:34,567 --> 00:10:36,858
[mumbling]

193
00:10:36,942 --> 00:10:38,150
What?

194
00:10:39,608 --> 00:10:42,650
I wanna go... Raphtalia.

195
00:10:42,733 --> 00:10:43,775
[RAPHTALIA gasps]

196
00:10:43,858 --> 00:10:44,817
Yeah, um...

197
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:46,483
We'll go back.

198
00:10:46,567 --> 00:10:48,733
Back home to
our village together.

199
00:10:48,817 --> 00:10:50,692
I wanna go home.

200
00:10:54,692 --> 00:10:57,233
[RIFANA]
Hm? Is that the...?

201
00:11:01,525 --> 00:11:02,817
Yeah, I'm sorry.

202
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:05,525
It's the best thing
I could come up with for now.

203
00:11:06,567 --> 00:11:08,108
I'm so happy.

204
00:11:08,192 --> 00:11:10,067
Thanks, Raphtalia.

205
00:11:17,525 --> 00:11:21,150
[RAPHTALIA coughs]
Rifana?

206
00:11:24,442 --> 00:11:26,025
--[JAILER 15A] Hey.
--[gasps]

207
00:11:27,108 --> 00:11:28,358
[JAILER 15A]
Out.

208
00:11:28,442 --> 00:11:29,692
[RAPHTALIA]
Huh?

209
00:11:33,650 --> 00:11:35,483
[RAPHTALIA coughs]

210
00:11:35,567 --> 00:11:38,358
[JAILER 15A] You're being
sold to a slave merchant.

211
00:11:38,442 --> 00:11:41,650
But... what about Rifana?

212
00:11:41,733 --> 00:11:42,817
Please!

213
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:44,983
This is the only one
being sold for now.

214
00:11:45,067 --> 00:11:46,525
Go on, get outta here.

215
00:11:46,608 --> 00:11:47,983
What about Rifana?!

216
00:11:48,067 --> 00:11:50,817
[JAILER 15A laughs]
She's done for, forget her.

217
00:12:02,067 --> 00:12:05,608
[RAPHTALIA] Smile...
when times are tough...

218
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:09,108
[RAPHTALIA]
Huh?

219
00:12:09,192 --> 00:12:11,817
How will I ever smile again?

220
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:29,442
[VAN]
There's a survivor!

221
00:12:31,233 --> 00:12:32,150
Hey, Raphtalia!

222
00:12:32,233 --> 00:12:33,483
Let's go.

223
00:12:41,442 --> 00:12:43,775
[VAN]
You'll be all right now.

224
00:12:43,858 --> 00:12:46,233
[MELTY]
Naofumi! Over here!

225
00:12:55,692 --> 00:12:57,817
[FILO]
There's someone over here, too!

226
00:13:08,775 --> 00:13:10,025
You're alive?!

227
00:13:10,108 --> 00:13:11,358
Keel!

228
00:13:14,983 --> 00:13:16,150
Oh, Keel!

229
00:13:16,233 --> 00:13:18,525
I can't believe you're here!

230
00:13:18,608 --> 00:13:21,317
Who are... you?

231
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:24,608
I can't believe I found
you after all this time!

232
00:13:24,692 --> 00:13:28,150
I'm so glad--
so glad you're alive!

233
00:13:36,983 --> 00:13:38,483
Who are you? I don't--

234
00:13:38,567 --> 00:13:40,025
[RAPHTALIA]
Have you forgotten already?

235
00:13:40,108 --> 00:13:41,567
It's me, Raphtalia.

236
00:13:41,650 --> 00:13:43,733
You can't be her.

237
00:13:43,817 --> 00:13:45,150
Raphtalia?

238
00:13:45,233 --> 00:13:47,608
No way, that's impossible!

239
00:13:47,692 --> 00:13:49,067
No! Stay away!

240
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:50,483
Listen to me, Keel.

241
00:13:50,567 --> 00:13:52,358
Do you remember that time
when you went diving

242
00:13:52,442 --> 00:13:53,900
and nearly drowned?

243
00:13:53,983 --> 00:13:56,900
And we had to find Sadeena,
so she could come rescue you?

244
00:13:56,983 --> 00:13:59,233
And there was another time when
you ate a poisonous mushroom

245
00:13:59,317 --> 00:14:01,442
and ended up with
an upset stomach.

246
00:14:01,525 --> 00:14:03,983
In pain, you begged me
not to tell anyone.

247
00:14:04,067 --> 00:14:05,983
You remember that, don't you?

248
00:14:06,067 --> 00:14:09,400
After the Wave, when I said
we should rebuild the village,

249
00:14:09,483 --> 00:14:12,817
you were the very first one
to speak up and agree with me.

250
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:17,567
[RAPHTALIA] You don't know
how happy that made me.

251
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:21,233
Raphtalia, it's really you?

252
00:14:21,317 --> 00:14:23,567
You're really here after all?

253
00:14:23,650 --> 00:14:25,067
Thank goodness!

254
00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:27,650
I'm so grateful
you're still alive.

255
00:14:30,025 --> 00:14:31,483
[KEEL]
Who are they?

256
00:14:31,567 --> 00:14:33,067
It's okay.

257
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:35,483
I'm traveling with
the Shield Hero now.

258
00:14:35,567 --> 00:14:37,942
What? The Shield Hero?

259
00:14:38,025 --> 00:14:39,275
He really exists?

260
00:14:39,358 --> 00:14:40,525
[RAPHTALIA]
He sure does!

261
00:14:40,608 --> 00:14:43,442
And he's come here
to save all of us.

262
00:14:43,525 --> 00:14:45,442
Let me take a
look at your wounds.

263
00:14:51,608 --> 00:14:54,275
[gasps] You really
exist after all!

264
00:14:54,358 --> 00:14:55,608
Then all those stories

265
00:14:55,692 --> 00:14:59,108
I've heard about you
are actually true! [coughs]

266
00:14:59,192 --> 00:15:01,442
[RAPHTALIA]
You okay?

267
00:15:01,525 --> 00:15:03,025
[KEEL]
Yeah.

268
00:15:03,108 --> 00:15:04,483
Now I see...

269
00:15:04,567 --> 00:15:06,192
I was just thinking...

270
00:15:06,275 --> 00:15:08,608
Rifana would've
wanted to see him.

271
00:15:08,692 --> 00:15:10,608
Wait a minute...

272
00:15:10,692 --> 00:15:12,275
Where is Rifana?

273
00:15:12,358 --> 00:15:14,067
She's in here, right?!

274
00:15:16,233 --> 00:15:17,900
[RAPHTALIA gasps]

275
00:15:17,983 --> 00:15:20,275
--[RIFANA] Raphtalia...
--[RAPHTALIA] Hm?

276
00:15:20,358 --> 00:15:22,692
You know the Shield Hero?

277
00:15:22,775 --> 00:15:25,567
D'you believe
he'll come to save us?

278
00:15:25,650 --> 00:15:27,317
[RAPHTALIA]
I know he will!

279
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:29,150
[RIFANA]
I wanna see him soon.

280
00:15:29,233 --> 00:15:31,483
See him and...

281
00:15:31,567 --> 00:15:32,650
[RAPHTALIA]
And?

282
00:15:36,192 --> 00:15:38,900
And have him make me his wife.

283
00:15:47,275 --> 00:15:53,275
[RAPHTALIA sobbing]

284
00:16:12,358 --> 00:16:14,733
Oh, Master...

285
00:16:14,817 --> 00:16:16,233
I can't see how...

286
00:16:16,317 --> 00:16:19,650
...such monstrous deeds
could exist here.

287
00:16:19,733 --> 00:16:20,775
[VAN]
Melty...

288
00:16:20,858 --> 00:16:22,733
As much as I hate to say it,

289
00:16:22,817 --> 00:16:25,900
similar things happen
all across this country.

290
00:16:25,983 --> 00:16:27,692
It can't be!

291
00:16:27,775 --> 00:16:30,400
[VAN]
That is why we needed Seyaette.

292
00:16:31,483 --> 00:16:32,817
[VAN]
But now...

293
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:34,067
Melty, my dear,

294
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:37,858
I need you to do
something important for me.

295
00:16:37,942 --> 00:16:40,358
Return to the capital
and admonish the king

296
00:16:40,442 --> 00:16:44,650
for his unjust treatment
of the Shield Hero.

297
00:16:44,733 --> 00:16:47,983
Ordinarily, I would
go myself, but, as you know...

298
00:16:50,692 --> 00:16:52,567
I failed you.

299
00:16:52,650 --> 00:16:54,317
Forgive me.

300
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:57,317
Hey, Raphtalia, who was that?

301
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,275
My friend, Rifana.

302
00:16:59,358 --> 00:17:02,608
She was gentler and
more graceful than me,

303
00:17:02,692 --> 00:17:06,983
and she'd always say that...
that she wanted to meet you--

304
00:17:07,067 --> 00:17:09,108
to meet the Shield Hero.

305
00:17:11,858 --> 00:17:14,775
[NAOFUMI] Let's give her and
the others a proper send-off.

306
00:17:14,858 --> 00:17:18,775
They can't rest in peace
in a place like this.

307
00:17:18,858 --> 00:17:21,025
What's wrong?

308
00:17:21,108 --> 00:17:23,317
[RAPHTALIA]
I hate myself.

309
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:26,942
Because I couldn't
protect anybody.

310
00:17:27,025 --> 00:17:30,567
When we first met,
I was so weak and powerless.

311
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:33,317
I couldn't do anything.

312
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,567
I'm sure I could
have saved everyone.

313
00:17:35,650 --> 00:17:37,858
If only I'd been stronger.

314
00:17:37,942 --> 00:17:40,067
I'm too late...

315
00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:41,525
Come on, you did help!

316
00:17:41,608 --> 00:17:42,858
If you hadn't arrived
when you did,

317
00:17:42,942 --> 00:17:45,442
I probably would've
died in here.

318
00:17:45,525 --> 00:17:46,858
You saved my life.

319
00:17:46,942 --> 00:17:49,317
You're not weak. [groans]

320
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,400
You know what else?

321
00:17:50,483 --> 00:17:52,442
The only reason
everyone hung on so long

322
00:17:52,525 --> 00:17:54,567
without losing hope
was your smile!

323
00:17:54,650 --> 00:17:57,983
We decided to keep smiling,
no matter how bad it got!

324
00:17:58,067 --> 00:17:58,817
[RAPHTALIA]
Sorry.

325
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:00,567
[gasps]

326
00:18:00,650 --> 00:18:03,442
I'm sorry, but I'm just not--

327
00:18:03,525 --> 00:18:06,983
I'm afraid I'm-- Well, I just
can't smile like I used to.

328
00:18:07,067 --> 00:18:08,233
[KEEL]
Eh?

329
00:18:08,317 --> 00:18:10,817
I'm not worthy...

330
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:15,192
I mean I'm...
I ended up killing someone.

331
00:18:17,275 --> 00:18:19,025
You're wrong.

332
00:18:19,108 --> 00:18:20,942
[RAPHTALIA]
It was all wrong.

333
00:18:21,025 --> 00:18:23,567
Every single thing
I've done so far...

334
00:18:23,650 --> 00:18:24,942
All of it...

335
00:18:25,025 --> 00:18:26,525
...was a mistake!

336
00:18:26,608 --> 00:18:28,733
I don't deserve anything!

337
00:18:28,817 --> 00:18:30,900
[NAOFUMI]
That's not true!

338
00:18:30,983 --> 00:18:32,483
Raphtalia...

339
00:18:32,567 --> 00:18:34,233
[RAPHTALIA] I don't even have
the right to walk beside you!

340
00:18:34,317 --> 00:18:35,150
I'm worthless!

341
00:18:35,233 --> 00:18:36,983
[NAOFUMI]
Listen!

342
00:18:37,067 --> 00:18:39,358
You did nothing wrong!

343
00:18:39,442 --> 00:18:41,525
If it wasn't for you
being in my life,

344
00:18:41,608 --> 00:18:45,608
I'd've run from this world
without ever trusting anyone.

345
00:18:50,692 --> 00:18:52,150
[NAOFUMI]
That's right.

346
00:18:52,233 --> 00:18:54,150
It's because you believed in me

347
00:18:54,233 --> 00:18:56,442
that I am here
with you right now...

348
00:18:56,525 --> 00:18:59,233
...that I met Filo and Melty.

349
00:18:59,317 --> 00:19:00,233
Yeah, see!

350
00:19:00,317 --> 00:19:02,108
It just can't be a mistake.

351
00:19:02,192 --> 00:19:05,650
It's like, before, you were
so small and everything,

352
00:19:05,733 --> 00:19:07,983
and now you've
met the Shield Hero.

353
00:19:08,067 --> 00:19:10,067
You've turned into
this really cool lady

354
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:12,358
and even came back to save us!

355
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,483
[NAOFUMI]
Look.

356
00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:19,775
[NAOFUMI] You were the one
who kept those kids alive.

357
00:19:21,733 --> 00:19:23,775
Master Naofumi...

358
00:19:23,858 --> 00:19:25,733
Stop crying now.

359
00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:29,942
And I'm sure Rifana's
happy now, too.

360
00:19:30,025 --> 00:19:33,817
She finally got to
meet the Shield Hero.

361
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:36,483
From now on,
it's our job to protect them.

362
00:19:36,567 --> 00:19:37,942
To make sure nobody goes through

363
00:19:38,025 --> 00:19:40,733
this kind of
suffering ever again.

364
00:19:40,817 --> 00:19:43,650
Isn't that what we've been
fighting for all this time?

365
00:19:43,733 --> 00:19:45,150
[gasps]

366
00:19:46,608 --> 00:19:50,358
[NAOFUMI] Together with me,
the Shield Hero?

367
00:19:56,442 --> 00:19:57,817
It is!

368
00:20:03,525 --> 00:20:04,817
[RIFANA]
You're so lucky!

369
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:07,483
You're in the
Shield Hero's party.

370
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:09,858
[RAPHTALIA chuckles]

371
00:20:09,942 --> 00:20:11,483
So now you're jealous, right?

372
00:20:11,567 --> 00:20:13,900
Ah! Don't be such a jerk!

373
00:20:13,983 --> 00:20:16,275
[RAPHTALIA giggles]

374
00:20:18,442 --> 00:20:20,525
I promise to always
watch over you.

375
00:20:20,608 --> 00:20:22,608
[RAPHTALIA]
Mm.

376
00:20:22,692 --> 00:20:25,442
And one day, let's go
back to our village

377
00:20:25,525 --> 00:20:26,942
with that flag, okay?

378
00:20:27,025 --> 00:20:28,275
[RAPHTALIA]
Mm-hm!

379
00:20:43,525 --> 00:20:45,650
[RAPHTALIA]
Rifana...

380
00:20:45,733 --> 00:20:49,733
I promise you, I'll bring back
the flag for our people.

381
00:20:49,817 --> 00:20:52,025
With Master Naofumi.

382
00:21:03,525 --> 00:21:05,275
[VAN]
What is going on?

383
00:21:05,358 --> 00:21:07,567
[NAOFUMI]
The demi-humans are rioting.

384
00:21:07,650 --> 00:21:09,108
They came to bring
you home with them.

385
00:21:09,192 --> 00:21:11,733
So you probably oughta let them
know everything's all right.

386
00:21:11,817 --> 00:21:12,567
Indeed.

387
00:21:12,650 --> 00:21:14,233
[rumbling]

388
00:21:14,317 --> 00:21:15,400
What's that?

389
00:21:15,483 --> 00:21:16,525
Master, look over there!

390
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:18,192
What is that?

391
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:25,733
What a pain!

392
00:21:25,817 --> 00:21:27,233
How's he still alive?

393
00:21:27,317 --> 00:21:28,817
[IDOL]
O supreme god,

394
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:33,400
grant me the power to
rend the Devil asunder!

395
00:21:33,483 --> 00:21:35,192
I don't-- It can't be!

396
00:21:35,275 --> 00:21:36,650
What's wrong?

397
00:21:36,733 --> 00:21:38,817
The great heroes of the past
built that stone monument

398
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:40,817
to seal away a monster forever.

399
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:43,442
He's trying to remove the seal!

400
00:21:46,567 --> 00:21:48,025
[IDOL]
Yes! You're free now!

401
00:21:48,108 --> 00:21:49,942
Go and destroy everything!

402
00:21:50,025 --> 00:21:51,942
You're liberated
from your prison!

403
00:21:52,025 --> 00:21:55,942
Bring divine judgment down
upon the Devil of the Shield!

404
00:21:57,442 --> 00:21:58,775
[roars]

405
00:21:58,858 --> 00:22:00,692
Nobody can withstand me now!

406
00:22:00,775 --> 00:22:02,525
If I can kill the
Devil of the Shield,

407
00:22:02,608 --> 00:22:06,942
I will be eternally
blessed by God! [cackles]

408
00:22:09,358 --> 00:22:14,858
[roars]
