[NAOFUMI]
Wow, an open-air bath?

316
00:14:43,692 --> 00:14:45,942
[gasps] Master Naofumi?

317
00:14:50,067 --> 00:14:52,900
[giggles] It's really big!

318
00:14:52,983 --> 00:14:54,067
Huh?

319
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:56,067
[NAOFUMI]
Filo, don't swim in the bath.

320
00:14:56,150 --> 00:14:57,608
[FILO]
Why can't I?

321
00:14:57,692 --> 00:14:59,067
[NAOFUMI]
Wait, maybe that's okay...

322
00:14:59,150 --> 00:15:01,442
[RAPHTALIA] I was wondering
why Filo wasn't here yet.

323
00:15:01,525 --> 00:15:03,733
She's with Master Naofumi!

324

[FILO]
You swim, too, Master.

[NAOFUMI]
I don't feel like it.

326
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:08,983
[FILO]
Then wash my hair.

327
00:15:09,067 --> 00:15:10,858
[NAOFUMI]
Can't you do it yourself?

328

[RAPHTALIA sneezes]

330
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:19,983
[RAPHTALIA] Filo ended up
being with Master Naofumi

331
00:15:20,067 --> 00:15:21,275
the whole time.

332
00:15:23,108 --> 00:15:27,067
[RAPHTALIA] Anyway, I want to
share this drink with him.

333
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:29,942
[FILO]
That feels good, Master.

334
00:15:30,025 --> 00:15:31,733
[NAOFUMI]
You have way too much hair.

335
00:15:31,817 --> 00:15:33,317
Brushing it is a real pain.

336
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,442
[FILO]
Is it really?

337
00:15:35,525 --> 00:15:38,483
Yeah, Raphtalia had much
shorter hair than yours.

338
00:15:38,567 --> 00:15:41,608
[RAPHTALIA] I wish he was
brushing my hair right now...

339
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,733
Um, listen. I'd also like--

340
00:15:44,817 --> 00:15:45,858
[FILO]
Master, I'm thirsty.

341
00:15:45,942 --> 00:15:47,358
Can I please have a drink?

342
00:15:47,442 --> 00:15:48,567
[NAOFUMI]
Turn around and sit still

343
00:15:48,650 --> 00:15:50,233
or I won't brush
your hair again.

344
00:15:50,317 --> 00:15:54,150
No! It feels good,
so keep going!

345
00:15:54,233 --> 00:15:56,608
Can you do my feathers,
too, please?

346

You can do your wings yourself.

Never mind, it's nothing.

350
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,650

If I don't do something,

353

Filo will steal
my Master Naofumi.

[RAPHTALIA] If I want to turn
this around once and for all...

[RAPHTALIA sighs]

356
00:16:34,233 --> 00:16:36,567
[RAPHTALIA] Mom always used
to say that giving a gift

357
00:16:36,650 --> 00:16:39,358
was the best way to get
your beloved's attention.

358
00:16:40,942 --> 00:16:42,108
[RAPHTALIA]
She fell in love with Dad

359
00:16:42,192 --> 00:16:44,358
after he gave her a gift, too.

360
00:16:50,275 --> 00:16:52,692
[RAPHTALIA] If I could just
give him some latium.

361
00:16:52,775 --> 00:16:54,608
[GUEST 7B] Hey, have you
ever heard of latium?

362
00:16:54,692 --> 00:16:58,108
[GUEST 7A] Oh, you mean that
rare crystal found in this area?

363
00:16:58,192 --> 00:17:00,483
Everyone says that if you
make a love charm out of it,

364
00:17:00,567 --> 00:17:02,233
it works amazingly well.

365
00:17:02,317 --> 00:17:04,817
[GUEST 7B]
No! Really?

366
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:06,942
[RAPHTALIA] A bird called
a gagocco collects it,

367
00:17:07,025 --> 00:17:10,400
so if I find one of their nests,
I'll find some latium!

368
00:17:10,483 --> 00:17:13,025
I'll be able to give it as
a gift to Master Naofumi,

369
00:17:13,108 --> 00:17:16,192
and then... [gasps]

What's this about Master?

[RAPHTALIA] Huh? Where'd
that voice come from?

00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:25,900
Filo, is that you?

375
00:17:25,983 --> 00:17:27,650
[RAPHTALIA]
Why is she up in the mountains?

376
00:17:27,733 --> 00:17:29,858
Don't tell me she's
after the latium, too?

377
00:17:29,942 --> 00:17:32,567
[FILO] You're here for
the eggs, too, aren't you?

378
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:34,108
[RAPHTALIA]
Huh?

379
00:17:34,192 --> 00:17:36,108
[FILO] Sure! The old man at
the inn told me that the eggs

380
00:17:36,192 --> 00:17:39,983
of a bird called a gagocco
are a rare delicacy.

381
00:17:40,067 --> 00:17:41,108
[RAPHTALIA]
Oh, I see,

382
00:17:41,192 --> 00:17:42,733
she's just being a
glutton like always.

She's such a child.

384
00:17:44,442 --> 00:17:46,442
If I take a rare
delicacy to Master,

385
00:17:46,525 --> 00:17:48,525
I know he'll like
me more and more.

386
00:17:48,608 --> 00:17:50,567
I'm sure he'll pet me
and brush my hair

00:17:50,650 --> 00:17:52,650
and become my mate forever.

[FILO gasps]

472
00:21:32,525 --> 00:21:34,775
Both of you, go take a
dip in the hot spring.

473
00:21:34,858 --> 00:21:35,983
[BOTH]
Huh?

474
00:21:37,025 --> 00:21:39,858
[BOTH laugh]

475
00:21:39,942 --> 00:21:42,150
[RAPHTALIA] He still treats
me like a child sometimes,

476
00:21:42,233 --> 00:21:45,817
but one day, I'll make sure
he notices my womanly charms,

477
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:47,483
and then we'll see!

478
00:21:47,567 --> 00:21:48,775
Right, Filo?

479
00:21:48,858 --> 00:21:51,233
[FILO]
Hm? Mm-hmm!

480
00:21:51,317 --> 00:21:53,400
Uh--huh?

481
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,983
[STAFFER 7B]
Godspeed.

482
00:23:27,067 --> 00:23:28,775
An epidemic to
the east, you say?

483
00:23:28,858 --> 00:23:30,983
That's right. Apparently they
don't have enough medicine

484
00:23:31,067 --> 00:23:32,900
for everyone who's sick.

485
00:23:34,650 --> 00:23:37,983
Master Naofumi,
where are we heading to now?

486
00:23:38,817 --> 00:23:40,358
We're going east.

487
00:23:40,442 --> 00:23:43,150
