--[NAOFUMI] Hm?

00:00:19,608 --> 00:00:22,525
[SLAVE coughing]

3
00:00:26,608 --> 00:00:28,733
[SLAVE TRADER]
Sir, over here.

4
00:00:28,817 --> 00:00:32,483
I recommend this for a high-
class gent such as yourself.

5
00:00:37,817 --> 00:00:40,233
[SLAVE TRADER]
It's at level 75.

6
00:00:40,317 --> 00:00:43,608
[NAOFUMI]
That's almost 20 times my level.

7
00:00:43,692 --> 00:00:45,067
How much you want for it?

8
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:49,025
Well, it is highly capable
in battle and fairly rare...

9
00:00:49,108 --> 00:00:51,525
How does 15 gold pieces sound?

10
00:00:51,608 --> 00:00:53,275
Showing me your
most expensive slave

11
00:00:53,358 --> 00:00:55,108
knowing full well
I can't afford it?

12
00:00:55,192 --> 00:00:56,400
Indeed.

13
00:00:56,483 --> 00:00:58,317
You're gonna become
one of my best customers.

14
00:00:58,400 --> 00:00:59,858
I got a nose for these things.

15
00:00:59,942 --> 00:01:02,275
So I gotta make sure
you develop a keen eye,

16
00:01:02,358 --> 00:01:04,775
if you catch my drift, good sir.

17
00:01:04,858 --> 00:01:06,192
Well, now.

18
00:01:06,275 --> 00:01:09,025
Since you've seen my best,
lemme ask you a question.

19
00:01:09,108 --> 00:01:12,858
Exactly what kind of slave
are you in the market for?

20
00:01:12,942 --> 00:01:15,942
One that's cheap and
obedient'll work.

21
00:01:16,025 --> 00:01:17,817
[SLAVE TRADER]
In other words, a demi-human,

22
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:19,775
if I understand right?

23
00:01:19,858 --> 00:01:23,483
These aren't much suited
for combat or manual labor.

24
00:01:23,567 --> 00:01:26,025
Doesn't matter. If I need 'em
in battle, I'll train them.

25
00:01:26,108 --> 00:01:28,025
[SLAVE TRADER] Ha!
That's an amusing response,

26
00:01:28,108 --> 00:01:30,775
when you don't
believe in people.

27
00:01:30,858 --> 00:01:32,817
Yeah, but slaves aren't people.

28
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:35,650
Training one's the same thing
as upgrading my shield.

29
00:01:35,733 --> 00:01:37,900
[SLAVE TRADER] Ha, ha!
Well, you got me there,

30
00:01:37,983 --> 00:01:40,275
that's for sure!

31
00:01:40,358 --> 00:01:43,275
These are the cheapest
slaves I can offer you.

32
00:01:43,358 --> 00:01:44,900
Other than the
dead ones, of course.

33
00:01:44,983 --> 00:01:46,025
On the left I have--

34
00:01:46,108 --> 00:01:46,900
[NAOFUMI]
Raise your head.

35
00:01:46,983 --> 00:01:47,942
Huh?

36
00:01:48,025 --> 00:01:51,400
[SLAVE coughing]

37
00:01:52,525 --> 00:01:55,108
[SLAVE TRADER] That mangy
half-raccoon's sick as a dog

38
00:01:55,192 --> 00:01:57,942
and a couple spokes
short of a cartwheel.

39
00:01:58,025 --> 00:02:00,817
I'm having a helluva
time with her myself.

40
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:01,983
[gasps]

41
00:02:02,067 --> 00:02:03,317
[SLAVE TRADER]
You see, her previous owner

42
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,858
loved his torture.

43
00:02:05,942 --> 00:02:08,900
She's not long for this world.
I'd suggest something else.

44
00:02:08,983 --> 00:02:09,942
[NAOFUMI]
I've decided.

45
00:02:10,025 --> 00:02:11,025
[SLAVE TRADER]
Eh?

46
00:02:11,108 --> 00:02:13,442
She'll do, I'll take this one.

47
00:02:13,525 --> 00:02:14,983

What's with that?

Nothing to worry about.
The pain will dissipate soon.

78
00:04:13,692 --> 00:04:15,817
That slave crest
branded on her chest

79
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:19,067
makes it impossible
for her to defy you.

80
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,317
[NAOFUMI]
Huh? "Set as companion"?

81
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:28,775
[SLAVE TRADER] There you go,
good sir. She's all yours.

82
00:04:28,858 --> 00:04:31,567
[NAOFUMI]
Thirty silvers, right?

83
00:04:36,192 --> 00:04:38,192
There's one extra in here.

84
00:04:38,275 --> 00:04:39,567
That's your commission.

85
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:41,192
You were going to wring
it out of me anyway,

86
00:04:41,275 --> 00:04:42,317
now weren't you?

87

Well, you certainly
know your stuff!

Now then, I guess
I'm supposed to know

89
00:04:46,275 --> 00:04:47,608
what your name is, right?

90
00:04:47,692 --> 00:04:48,983
[coughing]

91
00:04:49,067 --> 00:04:51,400
[NAOFUMI]
Well? Tell me your name.

92
00:04:51,483 --> 00:04:53,150
I said, what's your name?

93
00:04:53,233 --> 00:04:56,067
I'm called... Raphtalia.

94
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:58,025
Raphtalia, huh?

95
00:04:59,525 --> 00:05:00,858
[NAOFUMI]
Let's go.

00:05:02,775 --> 00:05:06,358
I look forward to your next
visit--we're always open!

[chuckles]

98
00:05:09,733 --> 00:05:11,858
[SLAVE TRADER]
So he really did choose her.

00:05:11,942 --> 00:05:15,942
I'm gettin' goosebumps just
thinkin' about it. [chuckles]

Welcome! Hm?

Oh, it's you.

102
00:05:23,275 --> 00:05:26,317
Well, well. What's
with the girl, kid?

103
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,150
Hm?

104
00:05:28,233 --> 00:05:30,233
[NAOFUMI]
Give me a weapon she can use.

105
00:05:30,317 --> 00:05:32,942
And keep it under
six silvers, all right?

106
00:05:35,108 --> 00:05:36,983
[NAOFUMI]
Took you long enough.

107
00:05:37,067 --> 00:05:39,067
I'm-I'm sorry, sir.

108
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:40,900
Yeah, right...

109
00:05:40,983 --> 00:05:43,900
Now come on--let's see
you draw your knife.

110
00:05:43,983 --> 00:05:45,025
Huh?

111
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,650
[gasps]

112
00:05:47,733 --> 00:05:49,692
I want you to stab this thing.

113
00:05:49,775 --> 00:05:51,692
[RAPHTALIA]
N-No...

114
00:05:51,775 --> 00:05:53,358
That's an order!

115
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:00,067
[NAOFUMI] You only hurt
yourself by refusing.

116
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:01,650
Now do it!

117
00:06:04,192 --> 00:06:05,733
[yells]

118
00:06:07,025 --> 00:06:10,025
Too weak! Put some
muscle into it!

00:06:10,108 --> 00:06:11,233
Come on!

[NAOFUMI] Huh? I got
experience points, too?

122
00:06:20,608 --> 00:06:22,567
[ERHARDT] Probably because
when you formed the pact,

123
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:24,525
you set her as a companion.

124
00:06:24,608 --> 00:06:25,775
Oh, now wait a minute,

125
00:06:25,858 --> 00:06:27,192
don't tell me you didn't
do that with the lady

126
00:06:27,275 --> 00:06:28,358
who was in here before.

From here on out, I expect
you to fight monsters for me,

130
00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:38,108
is that perfectly clear?

131
00:06:38,192 --> 00:06:40,400
Even though it wasn't
much, I paid for you,

132
00:06:40,483 --> 00:06:43,233
so you'd better pitch in and
help me recoup the expense.

gonna die a painless death.

Oh, boy....

I don't know whether the
country's going to the dogs

00:06:59,858 --> 00:07:02,192
or if the kid's just
been corrupted.

three silvers. [sighs]

00:07:46,775 --> 00:07:48,025
Can we get somthin' to eat here?

159
00:07:48,108 --> 00:07:50,525
Huh? Yeah, be right there.

[PATRON 2C]
Look, it's a demi-human.

161
00:07:52,192 --> 00:07:55,608
Gimme the cheapest lunch
that you got here, for one.

162
00:07:55,692 --> 00:07:59,275
And, uh, she'll have whatever
that kid over there's having.

163
00:07:59,358 --> 00:08:01,192
[WAITER 2A]
That'll be nine coppers.

164
00:08:01,275 --> 00:08:02,942
[NAOFUMI]
Yeah... fine.

165
00:08:05,858 --> 00:08:07,358
Why, sir?

Why what? You don't want that?

167
00:08:10,025 --> 00:08:13,108
No, sir. Why are you
getting it for me?

168
00:08:13,192 --> 00:08:16,650
I dunno. 'Cause you looked like
you wanted to try it, I guess.

[WAITER 2A]
All right, here's your food.

[RAPHTALIA gasps]

You saving it for later?

172
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:27,567
[RAPHTALIA]
It's all for me?

173
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:31,858
[NAOFUMI]
Go on, eat.

00:08:47,733 --> 00:08:48,900
[NAOFUMI]
Drink this.

00:08:57,358 --> 00:08:58,358
How's the food?

[RAPHTALIA]
Hm?

[NAOFUMI]
Damn, still can't taste a thing.

00:09:32,858 --> 00:09:35,108
That's something that
might come in handy.

00:09:35,192 --> 00:09:37,442
[RAPHTALIA]
Master? Sir?

185

Who are you? And what I
mean is, who are you really?

I'm a hero. The Shield Hero.

the Four Cardinal Heroes?

[RAPHTALIA'S DAD]
Raphtalia.

Do you know of the
four legendary heroes?

00:09:55,442 --> 00:09:56,358
[RAPHTALIA]
Mm-hm.

192
00:09:56,442 --> 00:09:57,608
The ones with the
sword, the bow,

193
00:09:57,692 --> 00:09:59,275
the spear, and then, um...

194
00:09:59,358 --> 00:10:01,192
And then the one
with the shield!

195

Right.

196
00:10:02,525 --> 00:10:04,483
The Shield Hero, out of
all the Cardinal Heroes,

197

treated us demi-humans very well
and we're grateful to him.

He did?

Then I for sure wanna
meet him, Daddy.

[NAOFUMI]
Drink this.

[NAOFUMI]
It's a medicine that I blended.

00:10:38,025 --> 00:10:40,692
Apparently, it can
cure light colds.

to taste bitter.

off the shelves lately,

more for your medicine.

I see.

would be a small

of any spots nearby

317
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:02,483
where you can earn
a lot of money quick?

318
00:16:02,567 --> 00:16:03,483
[MERCHANT 2B]
Hmm...

319
00:16:03,567 --> 00:16:05,233
Well, now that you mention it,

320
00:16:05,317 --> 00:16:07,192
the ore coming out of the
mines outside the walls

321
00:16:07,275 --> 00:16:09,608
oughta fetch a
decent amount, but...

322
00:16:09,692 --> 00:16:11,525
[NAOFUMI]
But what? What's the catch?

323
00:16:11,608 --> 00:16:13,358
Ever since the first Wave came,

324
00:16:13,442 --> 00:16:15,983
it's become home to a bunch
of dangerous monsters.

325
00:16:16,067 --> 00:16:18,817
These days nobody wants to go
anywhere near that place.

326
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:19,817
Monsters, huh?

327
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:21,192
[MERCHANT 2B]
Huh.

328
00:16:21,275 --> 00:16:22,483
I don't know what our
summoned "heroes" are doing,

329
00:16:22,567 --> 00:16:24,733
but if you ask me,
it isn't much.

330
00:16:34,733 --> 00:16:37,483
Well, exclusive
effects and skills.

331
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:43,567
That's pretty boring.

332
00:16:43,650 --> 00:16:46,192
A Rope Shield?

333
00:16:46,275 --> 00:16:48,233
All right.

334
00:16:48,317 --> 00:16:50,400
Air Strike Shield!

335
00:16:54,733 --> 00:16:56,400
[gasps]

336
00:16:56,483 --> 00:16:58,608
Anything wrong, sir?

337
00:16:58,692 --> 00:16:59,608
[NAOFUMI clears throat]

338
00:16:59,692 --> 00:17:02,233
It's nothing. Let's go.

339
00:17:08,317 --> 00:17:10,108
[NAOFUMI] If there
really are monsters here,

340
00:17:10,192 --> 00:17:12,317
the moment things
go south, we run.

341
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,858
And you're gonna
have to keep up.

342
00:17:13,942 --> 00:17:15,233
Okay.

343
00:17:16,483 --> 00:17:18,150
[RAPHTALIA]
Uh... 'scuse me?

344
00:17:18,233 --> 00:17:19,525
[NAOFUMI]
What is it?

345
00:17:19,608 --> 00:17:21,483
I was just wondering about...

346
00:17:21,567 --> 00:17:23,775
I mean, how should
I address you?

347
00:17:23,858 --> 00:17:25,192
[NAOFUMI]
Call me whatever.

348
00:17:25,275 --> 00:17:27,400
All right then.

349
00:17:27,483 --> 00:17:28,525
[RAPHTALIA gasps]

350
00:17:31,317 --> 00:17:32,983
[NAOFUMI]
Looks like the place.

351
00:17:34,192 --> 00:17:35,692
Okay.

352
00:17:38,608 --> 00:17:40,650
[RAPHTALIA]
Hm?

353
00:17:40,733 --> 00:17:42,567
Footprints?

354
00:17:42,650 --> 00:17:45,233
This may not be
so tough after all.

355
00:17:45,317 --> 00:17:48,025
Raphtalia, let's try
a little further--

356
00:17:57,150 --> 00:17:59,525
[RAPHTALIA]
No!

357
00:18:11,150 --> 00:18:12,983
[RAPHTALIA coughs]

358
00:18:13,067 --> 00:18:14,567
Think you can make it?

359
00:18:14,650 --> 00:18:17,025
Dog... Dog monster...

360
00:18:17,108 --> 00:18:21,983
It killed all the villagers--
even my mother and father.

361
00:18:22,067 --> 00:18:24,233
[NAOFUMI]
During the first Wave, huh?

362
00:18:25,483 --> 00:18:28,025
[NAOFUMI] That's why
she cries every night.

363
00:18:32,025 --> 00:18:33,192
[RAPHTALIA gasps]

364
00:18:34,567 --> 00:18:35,650
[NAOFUMI]
Is that the same monster

365
00:18:35,733 --> 00:18:37,817
that killed your parents?

366
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:38,817
[RAPHTALIA]
No.

367
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:41,317
[NAOFUMI]
Listen, Raphtalia.

368
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:44,150
You take that thing
out here and now.

369
00:18:44,233 --> 00:18:45,192
Huh?

370
00:18:45,275 --> 00:18:46,900
If you fight and
make me stronger,

371
00:18:46,983 --> 00:18:48,858
we'll fend off the
Waves of Catastrophe

372
00:18:48,942 --> 00:18:52,358
and make sure that tragedy
never happens again.

373
00:18:52,442 --> 00:18:55,358
Face it, your parents
aren't coming back.

374
00:18:55,442 --> 00:18:56,858
But we can prevent other kids

375
00:18:56,942 --> 00:18:59,525
from going through
what you experienced.

376
00:18:59,608 --> 00:19:00,733
You can do it!

377
00:19:00,817 --> 00:19:02,817
And what I'm capable
of doing is making sure

378
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:05,567
you have the skills to
fight as best you can!

379
00:19:09,525 --> 00:19:10,567
[gasps]

380
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:13,775
Raphtalia! You gotta kill it!

381
00:19:13,858 --> 00:19:17,983
Grab your sword and
kill this thing! Do it now!

382
00:19:18,067 --> 00:19:19,400
I can't...

383
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:23,400
[NAOFUMI]
If I die, you're gonna die, too!

384
00:19:23,483 --> 00:19:24,525
Please, no!

385
00:19:24,608 --> 00:19:26,692
[NAOFUMI]
Then hurry up and kill it!

386
00:19:26,775 --> 00:19:28,942
That's an order! Do it now!

387
00:19:29,025 --> 00:19:31,150
[screams]

388
00:19:43,692 --> 00:19:47,150
All right then, just forget it.

389
00:19:47,233 --> 00:19:49,858
If you can't fight,
then get the hell outta here.

390
00:19:49,942 --> 00:19:52,317
[gasps] But what'll
you do, Master?

391
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:55,400
[NAOFUMI]
I'll buy time for you to escape.

392
00:19:55,483 --> 00:19:57,358
[RAPHTALIA]
What?

393
00:19:57,442 --> 00:20:02,358
Then that'd be just...
just like my parents...

394
00:20:02,442 --> 00:20:03,858
[NAOFUMI]
Hurry up! Run!

395
00:20:03,942 --> 00:20:05,358
Master, I can't!

396
00:20:05,442 --> 00:20:06,817
[NAOFUMI groans]

397
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:09,483
I can't do this.

398
00:20:09,567 --> 00:20:10,858
No!

399
00:20:15,025 --> 00:20:16,733
[RAPHTALIA]
Don't leave me!

400
00:20:18,108 --> 00:20:20,567
Don't leave me, please, no!

401
00:20:27,358 --> 00:20:29,275
[RAPHTALIA]
No!

402
00:20:36,108 --> 00:20:36,983
[RAPHTALIA gasps]

403
00:20:37,067 --> 00:20:38,567
[NAOFUMI]
Air Strike Shield!

404
00:20:40,275 --> 00:20:41,358
Now, Raphtalia!

405
00:20:41,442 --> 00:20:43,608
[yells]

406
00:20:52,608 --> 00:20:54,358
[NAOFUMI]
Nice job, kid.

407
00:20:59,733 --> 00:21:02,608
Master! Naofumi!

408
00:21:02,692 --> 00:21:03,775
Careful!

409
00:21:03,858 --> 00:21:05,233
Even with the shield's power,

410
00:21:05,317 --> 00:21:07,358
this wound still
hurts like hell.

411
00:21:07,442 --> 00:21:09,400
Promise me you won't ever die!

412
00:21:09,483 --> 00:21:13,192
Don't leave me alone,
Master Naofumi--please!

413
00:21:13,275 --> 00:21:15,192
[NAOFUMI]
She's chosen my name...

414
00:21:16,442 --> 00:21:18,983
[NAOFUMI]
You attack, and I defend.

415
00:21:19,067 --> 00:21:22,150
That way, neither of us'll
have to worry about dying.

416
00:21:22,233 --> 00:21:24,025
All right.

417
00:21:24,108 --> 00:21:25,775
[NAOFUMI] We'll get outta
here once I feed this monster

418
00:21:25,858 --> 00:21:27,150
to my shield.

419
00:21:27,233 --> 00:21:29,983
[RAPHTALIA]
Okay, Master Naofumi.

420
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:33,233
Come on, get up.

421
00:21:33,317 --> 00:21:34,650
[RAPHTALIA]
A little longer?

422
00:21:34,733 --> 00:21:36,275
[NAOFUMI groans]

423
00:23:12,108 --> 00:23:13,983
[NAOFUMI] With all the cash
we made off that ore,

424
00:23:14,067 --> 00:23:15,525
you can eat all you want!

425
00:23:15,608 --> 00:23:16,858
[RAPHTALIA]
Thank you!

426
00:23:18,358 --> 00:23:19,650
Food okay?

427
00:23:19,733 --> 00:23:21,233
[RAPHTALIA]
Mm-hm!

428
00:23:21,317 --> 00:23:22,692
That's good.

429
00:23:26,608 --> 00:23:27,817
Master Naofumi?

430
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:29,275
[NAOFUMI]
Hm?

431
00:23:29,358 --> 00:23:32,108
No matter what happens,
we're going to survive!

432
00:23:32,192 --> 00:23:33,900
Of course we are.

433
00:23:35,025 --> 00:23:36,608
[RAPHTALIA]
Hm?

434
00:23:36,692 --> 00:23:37,900
[NAOFUMI]
Here.

435
00:23:37,983 --> 00:23:41,900
A kids' lunch isn't
complete... without this.

436
00:23:41,983 --> 00:23:43,358
[RAPHTALIA]
Huh?
