00:02:33,525 --> 00:02:35,192
Yeah, but a shield's
not really a weapon,

128
00:06:57,067 --> 00:07:00,983
the king's treating me, but
here's the story in a nutshell.

129
00:07:01,067 --> 00:07:04,608
There's an old apocalyptic
prophecy on this world.

130
00:07:04,692 --> 00:07:08,275
It speaks of a series of
incursions of destructive force.

131
00:07:08,358 --> 00:07:11,692
These have come to be
known as "Waves."

132
00:07:11,775 --> 00:07:14,775
If the calamities wrought by
the Waves are not stopped,

133
00:07:14,858 --> 00:07:18,067
the world will meet its end.

134
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:20,192
Every country here
has in its possession

135
00:07:20,275 --> 00:07:22,525
an ancient dragon hourglass.

136
00:07:22,608 --> 00:07:26,567
These devices can predict
each Wave's arrival.

137
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:28,692
The first Wave washed
over this country

138
00:07:28,775 --> 00:07:31,108
not long before
we were summoned.

139
00:07:31,192 --> 00:07:33,858
Between the local knights
and traveling adventurers,

140
00:07:33,942 --> 00:07:37,858
they somehow managed
to fend it off.

141
00:07:37,942 --> 00:07:40,400
However, the subsequent
Waves will become

142
00:07:40,483 --> 00:07:42,525
increasingly powerful.

143
00:07:42,608 --> 00:07:44,400
The sands in the
hourglasses will trickle

144
00:07:44,483 --> 00:07:47,067
as long as the
Waves keep coming.

145
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:50,942
The second will arrive
in less than a month.

146
00:07:51,025 --> 00:07:54,567
[AULTCRAY] We underestimated
the potency of the Waves.

147
00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:58,442
Once we actually experienced the
first one and barely survived,

148
00:07:58,525 --> 00:08:00,942
we realized that only
the Four Cardinal Heroes

149
00:08:01,025 --> 00:08:02,233
could counter them.

150
00:08:02,317 --> 00:08:05,692
So we followed the legend
and summoned you four.

151
00:08:05,775 --> 00:08:09,150

no time to lose!

story as in that book?

154
00:08:14,733 --> 00:08:16,733
Okay, I think we
get the gist of it.

thinking we'd save you for free.

157
00:08:20,442 --> 00:08:21,442
Of course not.

158
00:08:21,525 --> 00:08:22,983
Once you repel all the Waves,

159
00:08:23,067 --> 00:08:25,858
I can assure you we shall
reward you most handsomely.

160
00:08:25,942 --> 00:08:26,983
Yeah?

161
00:08:27,067 --> 00:08:28,567
Well, it would seem
we have no choice

162
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:30,317
but to take you at your word.

163
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,692
Long as you don't renege,
we'll work with you.

164
00:08:32,775 --> 00:08:35,192
But don't think for a moment
that you can tame us.

165
00:08:35,275 --> 00:08:36,400
Exactly.

166
00:08:36,483 --> 00:08:38,233
We won't put up with
you looking down on us.

167
00:08:38,317 --> 00:08:41,233
Right. What these guys said.

168
00:08:41,317 --> 00:08:43,400
[NAOFUMI] Good lord,
are they full of themselves.

169
00:08:43,483 --> 00:08:45,067
If I can trust that
we have reached

170
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:47,858
an agreeable arrangement,
I would ask you brave heroes

171
00:08:47,942 --> 00:08:49,692
to now check your statuses.

172
00:08:49,775 --> 00:08:51,733
[NAOFUMI]
Wait, what's a status?

173
00:08:51,817 --> 00:08:54,025
Um, yeah...

174
00:08:54,108 --> 00:08:55,358
Are you guys dense?

175
00:08:55,442 --> 00:08:56,942
It should've been the very
first thing you noticed

176
00:08:57,025 --> 00:08:58,358
when you got here.

177
00:08:58,442 --> 00:08:59,858
[NAOFUMI]
Oh, put a sock in it.

178
00:08:59,942 --> 00:09:02,317
Stop acting like
you know everything.

179
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,442
Don't you see the icon
in the lower right corner

180
00:09:04,525 --> 00:09:05,358
of your vision?

181
00:09:05,442 --> 00:09:06,608
[NAOFUMI]
Huh?

182
00:09:07,942 --> 00:09:09,567
[NAOFUMI]
Oh, hey. Now I do.

183
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:12,192
[REN] Try focusing
your attention on it.

184
00:09:12,275 --> 00:09:15,150
[NAOFUMI]
Uh. Like this?

185
00:09:15,233 --> 00:09:17,400
[gasps]

186
00:09:17,483 --> 00:09:19,400
[ITSUKI]
Only "Level 1"?

187
00:09:19,483 --> 00:09:21,275
Well, that's really
disconcerting, isn't it?

188
00:09:21,358 --> 00:09:22,525
Yeah, no kidding.

189
00:09:22,608 --> 00:09:25,108
Who can tell if we can
even fight like this?

190
00:09:25,192 --> 00:09:26,817
What is all this, exactly?

191
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:28,358
[MINISTER 1A]
It's called Status Magic,

192
00:09:28,442 --> 00:09:30,733
an ability exclusive
to the heroes.

193
00:09:30,817 --> 00:09:33,067
So where do we go?
What's the first step?

194
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:35,067
[MINISTER 1A]
You must set out on an adventure

195
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:37,817
to develop and upgrade
these legendary weapons

196
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:39,775
you have been equipped with.

197
00:09:39,858 --> 00:09:42,817
You mean they weren't already
maxed out when we got them?

198
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:46,150
Also, mine's not even
technically a weapon.

199
00:09:46,233 --> 00:09:49,025
Can't we just wield other
weapons until these are usable?

200
00:09:49,108 --> 00:09:51,067
[chuckles]

201
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:53,817
Suppose we'll have to
figure that out as we go.

202
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:55,650
Regardless, it looks
like we've all got

203
00:09:55,733 --> 00:09:57,400
a lot of training ahead of us.

204
00:09:57,483 --> 00:09:59,483
[ITSUKI] We'll have to
level up hard and fast.

205
00:09:59,567 --> 00:10:01,400
Then once the four of
us feel like we're ready,

206
00:10:01,483 --> 00:10:02,567
we can form a party and--

207
00:10:02,650 --> 00:10:04,317
[MINISTER 1A]
One moment, brave heroes.

208
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,442
[ALL]
Huh?

209
00:10:05,525 --> 00:10:07,317
I neglected to mention,

210
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:10,733
you must each recruit allies
and adventure separately.

211
00:10:10,817 --> 00:10:12,692
[ITSUKI]
And why is that?

212
00:10:12,775 --> 00:10:15,067
[MINISTER 1A] It is said
that by their very nature,

213
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:17,775
the legendary weapons
repel one another.

214
00:10:17,858 --> 00:10:19,400
If you try and work together,

215
00:10:19,483 --> 00:10:23,275
it will apparently hinder
their development.

216
00:10:23,358 --> 00:10:25,567
Looks like he's
telling the truth.

217
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:27,483
[NAOFUMI] And the weapons
are translating all the verbal

218
00:10:27,567 --> 00:10:30,608
and visual information
into Japanese for us.

219
00:10:30,692 --> 00:10:32,483
[AULTCRAY]
Since the sun is about to set,

220
00:10:32,567 --> 00:10:35,817
rest here for the night, and
begin your quests tomorrow.

221
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:38,400
In the meantime, we'll gather
the best of the best

222
00:10:38,483 --> 00:10:40,483
to form your parties.

223
00:10:40,567 --> 00:10:41,608
[ALL]
Huh?

224
00:10:41,692 --> 00:10:43,692
We have quarters
prepared for you all.

225
00:10:43,775 --> 00:10:45,983
Please, sirs, right this way.

226
00:10:46,067 --> 00:10:47,733
[LOWER OFFICIAL 1A]
I hear the Four Cardinal Heroes

227
00:10:47,817 --> 00:10:48,942
have been summoned.

228
00:10:49,025 --> 00:10:50,775
[LOWER OFFICIAL 1B]
All four in Melromarc?

229
00:10:50,858 --> 00:10:52,150
[LOWER OFFICIAL 1C]
Are they sure about this?

230
00:10:52,233 --> 00:10:53,817
[LOWER OFFICIAL 1D]
Then that means the Shield Hero

231
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:55,858
is here, too.

232
00:10:55,942 --> 00:10:57,983
[MOTOYASU] I guess when
you're "heroes of legend"

233
00:10:58,067 --> 00:10:59,733
you get special treatment.

234
00:10:59,817 --> 00:11:02,150
The girl who showed us
here was cute, too.

235
00:11:02,233 --> 00:11:03,650
[ITSUKI] And though it
did taste unusual,

236
00:11:03,733 --> 00:11:05,900
our dinner was quite sumptuous.

237
00:11:05,983 --> 00:11:08,733
[NAOFUMI] Doesn't this seem
kinda like a video game?

238
00:11:08,817 --> 00:11:10,775
That's 'cause it
is a video game.

239
00:11:10,858 --> 00:11:13,192
It's exactly like
<i>Emerald Online</i> .

240
00:11:13,275 --> 00:11:14,858
[NAOFUMI]
Uh, never heard of it.

241
00:11:14,942 --> 00:11:17,650
Huh? Seriously? It's huge!

242
00:11:17,733 --> 00:11:19,192
[ITSUKI]
What are you talking about?

243
00:11:19,275 --> 00:11:20,900
This isn't some online game.

244
00:11:20,983 --> 00:11:22,900
It's a new console
game I'm playing.

245
00:11:22,983 --> 00:11:24,525
Called <i>Dimension Web</i> .

246
00:11:24,608 --> 00:11:25,692
You're both wrong.

247
00:11:25,775 --> 00:11:27,483
Everything about this
place is identical

248
00:11:27,567 --> 00:11:31,067
to a VRMMO called
<i>Brave Star Online</i> .

249
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:32,733
[MOTOYASU]
Let's sort this out.

250
00:11:32,817 --> 00:11:36,733
First off, Ren, do you really
mean an actual, literal VRMMO?

251
00:11:36,817 --> 00:11:38,067
[REN]
Yeah.

252
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:40,358
You guys do get what he
means by that, too, right?

253
00:11:40,442 --> 00:11:41,942
[ITSUKI]
A sci-fi game I'm familiar with

254
00:11:42,025 --> 00:11:43,358
explored the concept.

255
00:11:43,442 --> 00:11:45,650
Yeah. I've read about
'em in light novels.

256
00:11:45,733 --> 00:11:48,567
Now to be sure, let's
compare general knowledge.

257
00:11:48,650 --> 00:11:52,233
Whose face is on the 1,000
yen bill? Ready, and...

258
00:11:52,317 --> 00:11:54,108
--[MOTOYASU] Gotaro Yawara.
--[NAOFUMI] Hideyo Noguchi.

259
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:56,567
[ALL]
Wait, who?!

260
00:11:56,650 --> 00:11:57,692
[MOTOYASU]
Buzzword of the year last year?!

261
00:11:57,775 --> 00:11:58,858
[NAOFUMI]
Favorite voice actors!

262
00:11:58,942 --> 00:12:00,192
[REN] Which countries
won World War II?

263
00:12:00,275 --> 00:12:01,942
[ITSUKI]
Who's the prime minister?

264
00:12:03,442 --> 00:12:06,108
[ITSUKI sighs]
Only one explanation.

265
00:12:06,192 --> 00:12:08,400
We're all from different
versions of Japan.

266
00:12:08,483 --> 00:12:09,858
Right.

267
00:12:09,942 --> 00:12:11,358
And they pretty much don't
sound nothing alike at all.

268
00:12:11,442 --> 00:12:12,733
[NAOFUMI sighs]

269
00:12:12,817 --> 00:12:15,567
So there are parallel worlds
with parallel Japans?

270
00:12:15,650 --> 00:12:17,817
[MOTOYASU] I thought we might
just be from different eras,

271
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:20,108
but it would seem not, huh?

272
00:12:20,192 --> 00:12:21,692
And I can't believe
all three of you

273
00:12:21,775 --> 00:12:24,733
have played video games that
are so much like this world.

274
00:12:24,817 --> 00:12:27,858
Why am I the only one
not familiar with it?

275
00:12:27,942 --> 00:12:29,608
Uh, what is it?

276
00:12:29,692 --> 00:12:31,817
Oh, nothing, I just
assumed it was because

277
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:33,192
you're the Shield Hero.

278
00:12:33,275 --> 00:12:34,567
[MOTOYASU]
Ha! You, too?

279
00:12:34,650 --> 00:12:36,858
Well, yeah. I mean,
it only makes sense.

280
00:12:36,942 --> 00:12:40,067
Huh?! Why? Is there something
wrong with the Shield?

281
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:40,983
Calm down.

282
00:12:41,067 --> 00:12:42,275
As the oldest one here,

283
00:12:42,358 --> 00:12:45,483
lemme bring you up to
speed on the basics.

284
00:12:45,567 --> 00:12:47,858
As far as I've ever seen,
the "Shielder" class,

285
00:12:47,942 --> 00:12:49,400
that specializes
in the shield...

286
00:12:49,483 --> 00:12:50,858
Uh-hm?

287
00:12:50,942 --> 00:12:54,275
...is for losers, because no
true gamers ever play it.

288
00:12:54,358 --> 00:12:55,275
Wha--?

289
00:12:55,358 --> 00:12:56,108
[NAOFUMI gasps]

290
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:59,067
No!

291
00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:00,858
How 'bout in your worlds?!

292
00:13:00,942 --> 00:13:01,983
Sorry, man.

293
00:13:02,067 --> 00:13:03,692
Shielders suck.

294
00:13:07,317 --> 00:13:08,942
So what's the terrain like here?

295
00:13:09,025 --> 00:13:12,358
Not sure, but it looks very
similar to what I'm used to.

296
00:13:12,442 --> 00:13:15,567
[ITSUKI] Each weapon has its own
ideal hunting ground. If we...

297
00:13:15,650 --> 00:13:16,817
[NAOFUMI]
Whatever.

298
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:20,025
If I'm too weak, I can
just rely on my party.

299
00:13:20,108 --> 00:13:23,442
And if I'm lucky, it might
even have some girls in it.

300
00:13:25,442 --> 00:13:27,608
[NAOFUMI] The shield's role
should be to defend the party

301
00:13:27,692 --> 00:13:30,150
and thwart enemy attacks, right?

302
00:13:30,233 --> 00:13:32,525
And while my love life
back home was lacking,

303
00:13:32,608 --> 00:13:34,942
here I might just
meet "the one."

304
00:13:35,025 --> 00:13:36,817
Heh. It'll be fine.

305
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:39,358
After all, I was
chosen for this.

306
00:13:39,442 --> 00:13:42,275
My success is all but assured!

307
00:13:42,358 --> 00:13:45,942
Look out! I'm comin', world!

308
00:13:46,025 --> 00:13:47,483
All right then.

309
00:13:47,567 --> 00:13:49,275
We start questing tomorrow.

310
00:13:49,358 --> 00:13:52,275
Let's head back to our rooms
and get a good night's sleep.

311
00:13:52,358 --> 00:13:54,108
[ITSUKI] Do you think
they have baths here?

312
00:13:54,192 --> 00:13:56,108
[MOTOYASU]
Outdoor ones, if any at all.

313
00:13:56,192 --> 00:13:57,358
[NAOFUMI]
Hell yeah.

314
00:13:57,442 --> 00:14:00,567
My grand adventure
begins tomorrow morning!

315
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:14,150
[NOBLES whispering]

316
00:14:17,317 --> 00:14:19,858
[AULTCRAY] We have gathered the
greatest warriors in the land.

317
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:24,025
These brave souls will fight
the Waves alongside you.

318
00:14:24,108 --> 00:14:25,317
[NAOFUMI]
So how's this work?

319
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:28,067
Take turns picking them
for our parties?

320
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:31,025
Dang! There's a real
looker here, too.

321
00:14:31,108 --> 00:14:32,067
[giggles]

322
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:33,608
[gasps]

323
00:14:33,692 --> 00:14:37,858
Our future champions, the time
has come to begin your journey!

324
00:14:40,775 --> 00:14:43,692
[NAOFUMI] What?! They're the
ones who get to choose?!

325
00:14:48,442 --> 00:14:50,150
[NAOFUMI]
Wh--? Huh?!

326
00:14:50,233 --> 00:14:53,900
Three there... Five
there... Four there...?

327
00:14:53,983 --> 00:14:55,525
Yo! King!

328
00:14:55,608 --> 00:14:59,567
I am loath to admit it, but
even I was not expecting this.

329
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:03,275
No volunteers? He must
have zero charisma.

330
00:15:03,358 --> 00:15:07,150
Ah. I've been made aware
of an unsettling rumor.

331
00:15:07,233 --> 00:15:08,817
[MOTOYASU]
Has something happened, sir?

332
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:10,275
[AULTCRAY]
Not exactly.

333
00:15:10,358 --> 00:15:12,567
The rumor that is quickly
spreading around town

334
00:15:12,650 --> 00:15:16,442
is that the so-called Shield
Hero is ignorant of this world.

335
00:15:16,525 --> 00:15:17,650
[NAOFUMI]
What?!

336
00:15:17,733 --> 00:15:19,358
[AULTCRAY] Legend tells
us the heroes arrive

337
00:15:19,442 --> 00:15:21,608
with a firm understanding
of our lands.

338
00:15:21,692 --> 00:15:23,067
And the townspeople
seem to think

339
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:25,858
he doesn't meet that criteria.

340
00:15:25,942 --> 00:15:27,400
Someone must've
been eavesdropping

341
00:15:27,483 --> 00:15:29,275
on our discussion last night.

342
00:15:29,358 --> 00:15:30,858
You think?

343
00:15:30,942 --> 00:15:32,400
[NAOFUMI]
All 'cause of a rumor?

344
00:15:32,483 --> 00:15:34,817
Sure, I may not know
much, but still!

345
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:36,442
Regardless, you don't
need five, Ren!

346
00:15:36,525 --> 00:15:38,400
How 'bout you give a
couple of them to me?

347
00:15:38,483 --> 00:15:40,775
I'm a loner, you're right.
I don't "need" them.

348
00:15:40,858 --> 00:15:43,483
Whoever cannot cut it
gets left in the dust.

349
00:15:44,650 --> 00:15:47,150
Motoyasu, help me out.
Don't you think this is unfair?

350
00:15:47,233 --> 00:15:50,692
Uh, yeah. I'm surprised
my party is all girls, too.

351
00:15:50,775 --> 00:15:53,150
[NAOFUMI] Clearly you're
super broken up about it, jerk.

352
00:15:53,233 --> 00:15:54,858
It might seem to
be the most fair

353
00:15:54,942 --> 00:15:56,650
if we split them
up three apiece,

354
00:15:56,733 --> 00:15:58,025
but if we try to
force the issue,

355
00:15:58,108 --> 00:16:00,400
it could destroy
everybody's morale.

356
00:16:00,483 --> 00:16:03,900
So, what? You're tellin' me
I have to just go it alone?!

357
00:16:03,983 --> 00:16:05,733
[NAOFUMI]
You guys know I'm a Shielder!

358
00:16:05,817 --> 00:16:07,858
The class you said
was for losers?

359
00:16:07,942 --> 00:16:11,442
Without a party, how am I
supposed to grow any stronger?!

360
00:16:14,025 --> 00:16:14,775
[MYNE]
Sir Hero!

361
00:16:14,858 --> 00:16:17,400
[BOTH]
Uh?

362
00:16:17,483 --> 00:16:20,108
[NAOFUMI gasps]
It's her!

363
00:16:20,192 --> 00:16:22,192
[MYNE] Would you kindly
allow me to switch parties

364
00:16:22,275 --> 00:16:24,358
and join the Shield Hero?

365
00:16:24,442 --> 00:16:25,608
Are you sure?

366
00:16:25,692 --> 00:16:26,942
I am!

367
00:16:27,025 --> 00:16:29,192
[NAOFUMI]
Wha--? For real?

368
00:16:29,275 --> 00:16:31,983
She's actually gonna
join my party?

369
00:16:33,525 --> 00:16:35,108
[AULTCRAY] Are there any
others who would be willing

370
00:16:35,192 --> 00:16:38,233
to join Master
Naofumi on his quest?

371
00:16:39,525 --> 00:16:41,275
[AULTCRAY]
Ah, well, so be it.

372
00:16:41,358 --> 00:16:43,442
We shall have to take
other measures, then.

373
00:16:43,525 --> 00:16:47,400
Master Naofumi, you will have to
recruit for your party yourself.

374
00:16:47,483 --> 00:16:50,400
Uh. Oh, uh, right!

375
00:16:50,483 --> 00:16:52,483
[AULTCRAY] Every month,
we shall provide each hero

376
00:16:52,567 --> 00:16:53,983
with the funds they require.

377
00:16:54,067 --> 00:16:55,483
This one time, however,

378
00:16:55,567 --> 00:16:59,650
Master Naofumi's payment will
be higher than the others.

379
00:16:59,733 --> 00:17:01,733
Here are your
initial war chests.

380
00:17:01,817 --> 00:17:04,108
Accept them with our thanks.

381
00:17:04,192 --> 00:17:06,567
[MINISTER 1A] Shield Hero
receives 800 silver coins

382
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:09,608
while the rest of you
each receive 600 silver.

383
00:17:09,692 --> 00:17:13,317
Procure all necessary
equipment and set forth!

384
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,525
[ALL]
Sir!

385
00:17:19,567 --> 00:17:22,192
[MOTOYASU]
Later, Naofumi!

386
00:17:22,275 --> 00:17:24,483
Take good care of her
now, you hear me?

387
00:17:24,567 --> 00:17:26,358
They said we can't
help you directly,

388
00:17:26,442 --> 00:17:29,400
but I can at least wish you best
of luck with your recruiting.

389
00:17:29,483 --> 00:17:32,442
Until next time. So long.

390
00:17:32,525 --> 00:17:34,192
Uh, bye!

391
00:17:35,317 --> 00:17:37,608
I beg your pardon,
Shield Hero, sir.

392
00:17:37,692 --> 00:17:40,650
Let me introduce myself.
My name is Myne Suphia.

393
00:17:40,733 --> 00:17:42,525
It's an honor to fight with you.

394
00:17:42,608 --> 00:17:46,150
I'm Naofumi Iwatani.
Nice to meet you.

395
00:17:46,233 --> 00:17:47,733
My pleasure!

396
00:17:48,775 --> 00:17:50,150
[NAOFUMI]
She's so friendly.

397
00:17:50,233 --> 00:17:51,525
Open and warm.

398
00:17:51,608 --> 00:17:55,067
I mean, she chose to join me
when no one else would.

399
00:17:55,150 --> 00:17:57,817
Gotta keep her safe,
no matter what!

400
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:01,942
Guess we should be going,
huh, Miss, um... Myne?

401
00:18:02,025 --> 00:18:04,983
Yes, Sir Hero.

402
00:18:05,067 --> 00:18:07,858
To start, I'll show
you around the village.

403
00:18:11,275 --> 00:18:12,817
[NAOFUMI]
I caught a glimpse last night,

404
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:15,067
but seeing it up close
really drives home

405
00:18:15,150 --> 00:18:16,775
how different this world is.

406
00:18:16,858 --> 00:18:19,858
[MYNE] Well, Sir Hero?
What shall we do next?

407
00:18:19,942 --> 00:18:22,483
[NAOFUMI]
Hmm, let's see here...

408
00:18:22,567 --> 00:18:24,192
First place we should
visit is a shop

409
00:18:24,275 --> 00:18:25,817
that sells weapons and armor.

410
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:27,483
That makes sense.

411
00:18:27,567 --> 00:18:30,567
With all that silver, I bet
you can buy some nice stuff.

412
00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:32,192
I'll take you to a shop I trust.

413
00:18:32,275 --> 00:18:34,025
They should have
everything you need.

414
00:18:34,108 --> 00:18:35,942
All right. That sounds great!

415
00:18:36,025 --> 00:18:38,400
Oh, good. Follow me!

416
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:41,692
[NAOFUMI]
So cute.

417
00:18:41,775 --> 00:18:44,567
Nothin' beats havin' a
girl in your party, eh?

418
00:18:47,650 --> 00:18:50,150
This place gets my
highest recommendation.

419
00:18:50,233 --> 00:18:54,525
Wow. A real-life weapons shop.

420
00:18:54,608 --> 00:18:56,108
Welcome, good sir.

421
00:18:56,192 --> 00:18:58,775
So, first time in a
weapons shop, is it?

422
00:18:58,858 --> 00:19:01,233
Well, you already know
how to pick the best one.

423
00:19:01,317 --> 00:19:04,025
Thanks. But actually,
she brought me here.

424
00:19:04,108 --> 00:19:05,192
[ERHARDT]
Hmm?

425
00:19:05,275 --> 00:19:07,608
You do look familiar,
miss. Have we met?

426
00:19:07,692 --> 00:19:10,067
Sure! I've been in here before.

427
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:12,233
Your shop is rather
renowned, after all.

428
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:14,442
[ERHARDT]
Aw, sweet of ya to say so.

429
00:19:14,525 --> 00:19:18,192
Anyhow, who's your companion
here with the funny outfit?

430
00:19:18,275 --> 00:19:19,692
Uh...

431
00:19:19,775 --> 00:19:21,483
[MYNE]
You mean you can't tell, sir?

432
00:19:21,567 --> 00:19:22,858
No.

433
00:19:22,942 --> 00:19:25,483
Are you tryin' to tell me
he's one of them heroes?

434
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:29,275
A shield. So, guess that
means you must be the dud.

435
00:19:29,358 --> 00:19:30,858
[NAOFUMI chuckles]

436
00:19:30,942 --> 00:19:32,400
[NAOFUMI] Why are these
dumb rumors about me

437
00:19:32,483 --> 00:19:34,567
spreading like wildfire?

438
00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:37,400
Whatever. I can't let
that get me down.

439
00:19:37,483 --> 00:19:40,650
I am indeed the Shield
Hero, Naofumi Iwatani.

440
00:19:40,733 --> 00:19:42,400
Pleased to meet you!

441
00:19:42,483 --> 00:19:44,317
[ERHARDT]
Naofumi, huh?

442
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,817
Well, if you become a regular,

443
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:48,567
I won't give two hoots
what you wield.

444
00:19:48,650 --> 00:19:50,525
All right, kid. Good to meet ya!

445
00:19:50,608 --> 00:19:51,900
[MYNE giggles]

446
00:19:51,983 --> 00:19:53,775
Now that that's
out of the way,

447
00:19:53,858 --> 00:19:56,650
could you provide Sir Hero
with his equipment needs?

448
00:19:56,733 --> 00:20:01,400
Our budget is...
around 250 silver.

449
00:20:01,483 --> 00:20:03,692
[ERHARDT] Left to right,
that's iron, magic iron,

450
00:20:03,775 --> 00:20:07,067
magic steel, and silver iron
in ascending order of price.

451
00:20:07,150 --> 00:20:09,275
All quality swords, guaranteed.

452
00:20:09,358 --> 00:20:12,692
[NAOFUMI] Wow. With one
of these, even I could-- Ah!

453
00:20:13,817 --> 00:20:15,317
Wait. What the--?!

454
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:19,525
[NAOFUMI yells]

455
00:20:19,608 --> 00:20:21,358
What the heck is going on?

456
00:20:21,442 --> 00:20:23,317
I have no idea.

457
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:26,150
It looked like they just
flew out of your hand.

458
00:20:26,233 --> 00:20:28,400
Yeah, but why?

459
00:20:28,483 --> 00:20:29,525
Huh?

460
00:20:30,650 --> 00:20:34,692
[NAOFUMI]
"Rule Violation"? What the hell?

461
00:20:34,775 --> 00:20:37,317
How do I fight
with just a shield?

462
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:39,233
It appears that
besides this shield,

463
00:20:39,317 --> 00:20:41,900
I'm not allowed to use
any other weapons.

464
00:20:41,983 --> 00:20:44,233
How does that work, then?

465
00:20:45,317 --> 00:20:47,192
[ERHARDT]
Hmm...

466
00:20:47,275 --> 00:20:50,733
At a glance, it's like
any other small shield.

467
00:20:50,817 --> 00:20:52,775
Does this thing not come off ya?

468
00:20:52,858 --> 00:20:54,150
[NAOFUMI]
I can move it around my body,

469
00:20:54,233 --> 00:20:57,192
but I can't find
a way to remove it.

470
00:20:57,275 --> 00:20:58,525
[ERHARDT]
That's strange.

471
00:20:58,608 --> 00:21:00,650
I can sense a great
amount of power in here,

472
00:21:00,733 --> 00:21:04,233
but my appraisal magic doesn't
really tell me much more.

473
00:21:04,317 --> 00:21:05,567
Ah...

474
00:21:05,650 --> 00:21:06,567
[ERHARDT]
Uh, thanks for showing me

475
00:21:06,650 --> 00:21:08,608
something interesting, anyway.

476
00:21:08,692 --> 00:21:10,317
Wanna buy some armor?

477
00:21:11,983 --> 00:21:16,400
Hey. Now you're starting to
look the part, at least.

478
00:21:16,483 --> 00:21:18,067
Yeah, thank you.

479
00:21:20,567 --> 00:21:22,275
[MYNE]
How much do you want for it?

480
00:21:22,358 --> 00:21:25,150
Hero's discount.
A hundred twenty silver.

481
00:21:25,233 --> 00:21:26,817
[MYNE]
And the buy-back price?

482
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:29,900
Well, let's see, if it's still
in mostly new condition,

483
00:21:29,983 --> 00:21:31,900
I'd offer you 100 silver.

484
00:21:31,983 --> 00:21:33,192
Buy-back price?

485
00:21:33,275 --> 00:21:34,400
Once you grow strong enough,

486
00:21:34,483 --> 00:21:36,650
you really won't need
this armor anymore.

487
00:21:36,733 --> 00:21:39,483
You don't wanna get ripped off
when you come to sell it back.

488
00:21:39,567 --> 00:21:40,858
Makes sense, I guess.

489
00:21:40,942 --> 00:21:42,400
All right. We'll take it.

490
00:21:42,483 --> 00:21:47,150
Excellent! I'll throw in some
innerwear to show my thanks!

491
00:21:47,233 --> 00:21:50,067
So! Where shall we head
to next, Sir Hero?

492
00:21:50,150 --> 00:21:51,233
Off to do battle?

493
00:21:51,317 --> 00:21:53,275
Uh, yeah!

494
00:21:53,358 --> 00:21:54,733
[NAOFUMI]
Time to level up!

495
00:21:54,817 --> 00:21:57,358
My adventure finally begins!

496
00:22:01,858 --> 00:22:03,608
[NAOFUMI]
Whoa...

497
00:22:07,817 --> 00:22:09,442
[rustling]

498
00:23:03,733 --> 00:23:07,400
[MYNE] Wow, there's no limit
to how much it can absorb.

499
00:23:10,650 --> 00:23:13,650
[MYNE] That must be part of
a legendary weapon's power.

500
00:23:13,733 --> 00:23:15,233
[NAOFUMI]
Yeah.

501
00:23:15,317 --> 00:23:18,400
And it must be why I don't feel
pain when I'm bitten, either.

502
00:23:18,483 --> 00:23:20,650
But before I can upgrade
to a better shield,

503
00:23:20,733 --> 00:23:23,317
it looks like I am gonna
need a lot more fodder.

504
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,150
[MYNE]
Oh, I see.

505
00:23:25,233 --> 00:23:27,442
By the way, are these
orange balloon fragments

506
00:23:27,525 --> 00:23:28,275
worth anything?

507
00:23:28,358 --> 00:23:29,525
Can we sell them?

508
00:23:29,608 --> 00:23:31,025
[MYNE]
Yes. But at most,

509
00:23:31,108 --> 00:23:34,233
they'll likely only fetch
one copper coin each.

510
00:23:34,317 --> 00:23:35,567
[NAOFUMI] Seeing how
Ren destroyed them,

511
00:23:35,650 --> 00:23:37,150
they must be really weak.

512
00:23:37,233 --> 00:23:39,067
Guess that's all they're worth.

513
00:23:39,150 --> 00:23:42,317
That should be enough
shield fodder for now.

514
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,192
The nice thing is as I level up,

515
00:23:44,275 --> 00:23:46,567
then my shield
should evolve, too.

516
00:23:46,650 --> 00:23:48,150
Let's call it a day then.

517
00:23:48,233 --> 00:23:50,900
We should stop back in
at the weapons shop.

518
00:23:50,983 --> 00:23:52,858
If we can buy some
new equipment for me,

519
00:23:52,942 --> 00:23:55,525
we'll get even farther tomorrow.

520
00:23:55,608 --> 00:23:57,817
[NAOFUMI]
Heh. Sounds fair enough.

521
00:23:59,317 --> 00:24:01,400
[ERHARDT]
Gear for the lady, hm?

522
00:24:01,483 --> 00:24:03,567
You'll certainly be
much stronger decked out

523
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:05,942
with some good equipment.

524
00:24:06,025 --> 00:24:07,108
Right?

525
00:24:07,192 --> 00:24:08,525
This might get expensive,

526
00:24:08,608 --> 00:24:11,567
so I suppose I should
start haggling now.

527
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:14,442
Really? Seems our hero
fancies himself a comedian.

528
00:24:14,525 --> 00:24:15,692
Eighty percent off.

529
00:24:15,775 --> 00:24:17,358
Dolt! Twenty extra!

530
00:24:17,442 --> 00:24:20,150
[NAOFUMI] Why's it going up?!
Eighty-nine off!

531
00:24:20,233 --> 00:24:21,525
[ERHARDT]
Anyone who tries to haggle

532
00:24:21,608 --> 00:24:24,442
before even seeing the goods
deserves to pay double!

533
00:24:24,525 --> 00:24:26,442
[NAOFUMI]
Yeah, yeah! Ninety percent off!

534
00:24:26,525 --> 00:24:28,400
[ERHARDT]
Ugh! Twenty-nine percent more!

535
00:24:28,483 --> 00:24:30,983
[NAOFUMI] Stop raising it!
A hundred percent off!

536
00:24:31,067 --> 00:24:32,442
[ERHARDT]
Then I'm just givin' it away!

537
00:24:32,525 --> 00:24:34,358
[NAOFUMI]
Free works for me!

538
00:24:34,442 --> 00:24:35,192
[MYNE giggles]

539
00:24:35,275 --> 00:24:36,358
[NAOFUMI, ERHARDT]
Uh...

540
00:24:36,442 --> 00:24:39,108
So, how much is all
that at 60% off?

541
00:24:39,192 --> 00:24:41,733
Four hundred eighty
silver, with a discount.

542
00:24:41,817 --> 00:24:43,275
That's the best I can offer.

543
00:24:43,358 --> 00:24:46,733
[NAOFUMI] That'll leave
us with, uh, 200 silver?

544
00:24:46,817 --> 00:24:49,983
Uh. Hey, Myne, would you
mind downgrading just a bit?

545
00:24:50,067 --> 00:24:53,025
I don't know how much inns
and other expenses cost yet.

546
00:24:53,108 --> 00:24:55,067
[MYNE]
Oh, we'll be fine, Sir Hero.

547
00:24:55,150 --> 00:24:56,442
The stronger I am,

548
00:24:56,525 --> 00:24:59,483
the more loot we can collect
from monsters, right?

549
00:24:59,567 --> 00:25:02,442
This'll keep us going.

550
00:25:02,525 --> 00:25:05,900
[NAOFUMI] There's the otherworld
trope I've been waiting for!

551
00:25:05,983 --> 00:25:08,358
Yeah, fine. Whatever
you say, milady!

552
00:25:08,442 --> 00:25:11,150
All right, shopkeeper,
we'll take these!

553
00:25:11,233 --> 00:25:13,025
[ERHARDT]
Thanks a ton, young hero!

554
00:25:13,108 --> 00:25:16,150
Gotta say, you have a
real nose for good deals.

555
00:25:16,233 --> 00:25:18,358
[MYNE]
Thank you, Sir Hero.

556
00:25:18,442 --> 00:25:20,608
By the way, do you know
of any places around town

557
00:25:20,692 --> 00:25:22,317
that'll buy these fragments?

558
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:25,317
There are shops that
specialize in monster goods.

559
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:27,692
They'll buy most of
those things off of ya.

560
00:25:27,775 --> 00:25:29,317
Great, thank you.

561
00:25:30,650 --> 00:25:31,942
[NAOFUMI]
Oh, man!

562
00:25:32,025 --> 00:25:33,733
The food at the castle
was delicious, too,

563
00:25:33,817 --> 00:25:35,358
but a pub is where
you experience

564
00:25:35,442 --> 00:25:37,275
real otherworld cuisine!

565
00:25:37,358 --> 00:25:38,775
[MYNE giggles]

566
00:25:38,858 --> 00:25:42,358
I'm so glad you're
enjoying your meal.

567
00:25:42,442 --> 00:25:45,400
[NAOFUMI] The meadow we fought
in today was over here, right?

568
00:25:45,483 --> 00:25:46,650
[MYNE]
Yep!

569
00:25:46,733 --> 00:25:48,275
Tomorrow, we'll be heading
to Lafan Village,

570
00:25:48,358 --> 00:25:50,150
which lies beyond this map.

571
00:25:50,233 --> 00:25:52,525
And past Lafan Village,
we'll find a dungeon

572
00:25:52,608 --> 00:25:54,608
that's perfect for
rookie adventurers.

573
00:25:54,692 --> 00:25:55,817
A dungeon?

574
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:58,067
[MYNE] We won't make
very much money there,

575
00:25:58,150 --> 00:26:01,150
but it's an excellent spot for
you to work on leveling up.

576
00:26:01,233 --> 00:26:02,442
Interesting.

577
00:26:02,525 --> 00:26:04,233
[MYNE]
Now that I have new equipment,

578
00:26:04,317 --> 00:26:07,525
and with you defending me,
it should be a walk in the park.

579
00:26:07,608 --> 00:26:10,275
Thank you, Myne. You've been
a wealth of information.

580
00:26:10,358 --> 00:26:11,775
[MYNE]
No problem.

581
00:26:11,858 --> 00:26:14,358
Uh, by the way, Sir Hero...

582
00:26:14,442 --> 00:26:17,608
...we have all this wine here,
aren't you going to drink some?

583
00:26:17,692 --> 00:26:18,650
[NAOFUMI]
Uh...

584
00:26:18,733 --> 00:26:20,358
I'm not into alcohol.

585
00:26:20,442 --> 00:26:24,733
Oh, that's too bad. This is
a really fantastic vintage.

586
00:26:29,442 --> 00:26:32,942
After the long day we've had,
I'd love to share it with you.

587
00:26:35,733 --> 00:26:39,317
[NAOFUMI] All of a sudden,
she's twice as seductive! But...

588
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:41,650
I'm sorry, but I really
just don't care for it.

589
00:26:41,733 --> 00:26:45,150
Is that so? Well, too bad.

590
00:26:45,233 --> 00:26:47,983
Heh. That's a hero
for you, I suppose.

591
00:26:48,067 --> 00:26:49,858
[NAOFUMI]
Uh, what do you mean?

592
00:26:49,942 --> 00:26:52,525
[MYNE]
This country is a matriarchy.

593
00:26:52,608 --> 00:26:54,233
No man who's from
here would ever dare

594
00:26:54,317 --> 00:26:56,400
turn down a drink
offered by a woman.

595
00:26:56,483 --> 00:26:57,942
[NAOFUMI]
Really? Guess I'm not very good

596
00:26:58,025 --> 00:27:00,692
at picking up on
this kinda stuff.

597
00:27:00,775 --> 00:27:02,817
Oh, don't worry, you'll learn.

598
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:06,358
I'm glad we got to discuss
our plans for tomorrow.

599
00:27:06,442 --> 00:27:09,275
I think I'll turn in early
tonight. Is that okay?

600
00:27:09,358 --> 00:27:13,192
Of course. I'll head up
after I finish your wine.

601
00:27:13,275 --> 00:27:16,025
Although drinking
alone gets so lonely.

602
00:27:16,108 --> 00:27:17,817
[NAOFUMI]
Uh, hey, Myne?

603
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:19,400
[MYNE]
Huh?

604
00:27:19,483 --> 00:27:22,817
Thanks again for joining up with
a Shield Hero who can't fight.

605
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:24,775
I declined tonight,

606
00:27:24,858 --> 00:27:27,775
but I swear I'll make
it up to you someday.

607
00:27:27,858 --> 00:27:30,358
[giggles] It's totally
fine, I mean it.

608
00:27:30,442 --> 00:27:33,025
I'll see you in the morning,
Sir Hero, Pleasant dreams.

609
00:27:33,108 --> 00:27:34,858
Yeah, g'night.

610
00:27:39,525 --> 00:27:42,983
[NAOFUMI] Hmm...
Two hundred silver coins left.

611
00:27:43,067 --> 00:27:46,150
Two rooms at 30 copper
each per night,

612
00:27:46,233 --> 00:27:49,150
and meals for two at
five copper each...

613
00:27:49,233 --> 00:27:52,650
That leaves a little
over 199 silver.

614
00:27:55,108 --> 00:27:57,900
Acting like such a stereotypical
Japanese tourist,

615
00:27:57,983 --> 00:28:00,275
stashing money like this.

616
00:28:00,358 --> 00:28:02,942
Holy crap, though. What a day.

617
00:28:05,067 --> 00:28:08,817
[NAOFUMI] I wonder how it truly
feels to kill a monster.

618
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:11,942
Today I just ran around
popping balloons.

619
00:28:12,025 --> 00:28:15,775
But still, I really
am in another world!

620
00:28:15,858 --> 00:28:19,567
[laughs]

621
00:28:19,650 --> 00:28:21,775
[MOTOYASU] Man, I leveled
up quite a bit today.

622
00:28:21,858 --> 00:28:23,567
[ITSUKI]
I won't let you outdo me twice!

623
00:28:23,650 --> 00:28:25,025
[MOTOYASU]
Ha, ha! We'll see about that!

624
00:28:25,108 --> 00:28:27,483
[NAOFUMI]
Is that Motoyasu and Itsuki?

625
00:28:30,692 --> 00:28:31,692
[NAOFUMI]
Time for bed.

626
00:28:31,775 --> 00:28:33,900
Off to an early start and all.

627
00:28:45,567 --> 00:28:47,525
[NAOFUMI yawns]

628
00:28:47,608 --> 00:28:51,692
Okay! Downstairs for some
breakfast and then head out!

629
00:28:51,775 --> 00:28:53,233
Huh?

630
00:28:53,317 --> 00:28:55,567
Gone... It's gone!

631
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:58,858
The silver, the chain mail,
and even my old clothes

632
00:28:58,942 --> 00:29:01,692
that I was keeping for when
I get to go back home!

633
00:29:01,775 --> 00:29:04,942
No way... I was robbed
in my sleep?!

634
00:29:12,817 --> 00:29:13,900
Myne, open up!

635
00:29:13,983 --> 00:29:16,108
All our money and
equipment's been stolen!

636
00:29:17,858 --> 00:29:19,067
You still asleep in there?

637
00:29:19,150 --> 00:29:22,192
Wake up! We're in
serious trouble!

638
00:29:22,275 --> 00:29:25,067
You guys're knights
from the castle, right?

639
00:29:25,150 --> 00:29:26,567
I'm glad you're here.
Listen, I'm--

640
00:29:26,650 --> 00:29:28,275
[KNIGHT 1A]
The Shield Hero, yes?

641
00:29:28,358 --> 00:29:30,858
Yeah, that's right.

642
00:29:30,942 --> 00:29:33,775
The king has issued
a summons for you, boy.

643
00:29:33,858 --> 00:29:36,358
You're to come with us.

644
00:29:36,442 --> 00:29:37,692
What?

645
00:29:39,942 --> 00:29:41,775
[NAOFUMI]
Ow, jeez!

646
00:29:43,067 --> 00:29:45,150
The hell's goin' on here?

647
00:29:46,692 --> 00:29:48,942
Myne, hey! Are you okay?

648
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:51,900
What's wrong?

649
00:29:53,775 --> 00:29:55,233
Yo, King!

650
00:29:55,317 --> 00:29:57,108
While I was sleeping, all of
the money and equipment I had

651
00:29:57,192 --> 00:29:59,942
other than this shield
was stolen from my room!

652
00:30:00,025 --> 00:30:01,608
Please, sir, find
the thief and--

653
00:30:01,692 --> 00:30:03,400
Silence, you filth!

654
00:30:03,483 --> 00:30:05,483
What's this about?

655
00:30:05,567 --> 00:30:08,067
Myne, I'm sorry
to ask, my dear,

656
00:30:08,150 --> 00:30:12,483
but would you mind repeating
your testimony for us again?

657
00:30:12,567 --> 00:30:14,775
[MYNE]
It-It happened last night.

658
00:30:14,858 --> 00:30:17,150
The Shield Hero forced
his way into my room;

659
00:30:17,233 --> 00:30:18,608
he was stinking drunk!

660
00:30:18,692 --> 00:30:20,692
He grabbed me and
pinned me down!

661
00:30:20,775 --> 00:30:22,233
Huh?!

662
00:30:22,317 --> 00:30:24,775
[MYNE] He said something like,
"The night is still young."

663
00:30:24,858 --> 00:30:25,983
And then the next thing I knew,

664
00:30:26,067 --> 00:30:27,942
he was tearing all
my clothes off!

665
00:30:28,025 --> 00:30:28,983
[NAOFUMI]
What?

666
00:30:29,067 --> 00:30:31,317
[MYNE]
Somehow, I managed to escape!

667
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:33,358
I ran down the hall for help.

668
00:30:33,442 --> 00:30:34,817
I found Sir Motoyasu,

669
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:38,150
who happened to be
staying at the same inn!

670
00:30:38,233 --> 00:30:39,525
[MOTOYASU growls]

671
00:30:40,692 --> 00:30:42,025
[NAOFUMI]
What the hell?

672
00:30:42,108 --> 00:30:43,983
[MOTOYASU] If she hadn't
asked me to wait until dawn

673
00:30:44,067 --> 00:30:47,900
and call the knights, I would've
gladly cut you down myself!

674
00:30:47,983 --> 00:30:49,150
What are you talking about?!

675
00:30:49,233 --> 00:30:51,192
I went straight to bed
after dinner last night,

676
00:30:51,275 --> 00:30:52,692
and I don't drink!

677
00:30:52,775 --> 00:30:56,067
Wait, that's my chain
mail that you're wearing.

678
00:30:56,150 --> 00:30:58,025
You thieving bastard,
give it back!

679
00:30:58,108 --> 00:31:00,233
Ha. Who are you calling a thief?

680
00:31:00,317 --> 00:31:02,775
Myne gave this armor
to me as a special gift

681
00:31:02,858 --> 00:31:04,775
when I met her at
the pub yesterday.

682
00:31:04,858 --> 00:31:06,900
[NAOFUMI gasps]

683
00:31:06,983 --> 00:31:08,858
[AULTCRAY] To think the
Cardinal Shield Hero

684
00:31:08,942 --> 00:31:11,942
would commit the greatest
sin in this country.

685
00:31:12,025 --> 00:31:13,400
[NAOFUMI]
Sin?

686
00:31:13,483 --> 00:31:16,150
In Melromarc, even attempted
sexual assault on a woman

687
00:31:16,233 --> 00:31:18,275
is punishable by death!

688
00:31:18,358 --> 00:31:19,983
[AULTCRAY]
If you weren't a hero,

689
00:31:20,067 --> 00:31:22,233
you'd be executed at once!

690
00:31:22,317 --> 00:31:24,275
Executed?!

691
00:31:24,358 --> 00:31:27,067
I promise you, I'm the one
being wronged to you, not her.

692
00:31:27,150 --> 00:31:28,608
I didn't do it.

693
00:31:28,692 --> 00:31:31,400
And If you're so convinced I
did, then show me some proof!

694
00:31:31,483 --> 00:31:33,275
[NAOFUMI gasps]

695
00:31:33,358 --> 00:31:34,442
[KNIGHT 1B]
When we performed a search

696
00:31:34,525 --> 00:31:37,567
of the Shield Hero's
room, we, um...

697
00:31:37,650 --> 00:31:40,358
We found this, sir,
strewn across his bed.

698
00:31:40,442 --> 00:31:42,025
[gasps]

699

You animal!

700
00:31:43,692 --> 00:31:45,983
[AULTCRAY] The proof
seems rather undeniable.

701
00:31:46,067 --> 00:31:47,192
[NAOFUMI]
How so?!

702
00:31:47,275 --> 00:31:49,233
That thing wasn't
there when I woke up!

703
00:31:49,317 --> 00:31:50,692
What a terrible shame.

704
00:31:50,775 --> 00:31:52,233
I worried something
bad might happen,

705
00:31:52,317 --> 00:31:53,900
but hoped you knew better.

706
00:31:53,983 --> 00:31:56,400
Guess he thinks a hero can do
whatever the hell he wants

707
00:31:56,483 --> 00:31:57,858
and get away with it.

708
00:31:57,942 --> 00:32:00,733
[NAOFUMI] That's not even
the least bit true, I swear!

This world is not some

00:32:09,192 --> 00:32:11,817
[NAOFUMI]
What the hell is this?

713
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:13,483
Why is this happening?

714
00:32:13,567 --> 00:32:15,983
Myne... Why?!

715
00:32:16,067 --> 00:32:18,483
Why would you lie like that?
We're supposed to be a party!

[NAOFUMI]
I see.

719
00:32:26,483 --> 00:32:29,525
Joining me was just a ruse so
she could destroy me right here.

720
00:32:29,608 --> 00:32:31,358
It was all a lie!

When she smiled at me,
or acted kind... Fake!

You liar! You tricked me!

723
00:32:40,525 --> 00:32:42,775
It was a setup from
the very beginning!

724

I'm scared, Sir Motoyasu!

Shut your mouth, you criminal!

726

Up yours, pretty boy!

727
00:32:48,858 --> 00:32:51,608
You did all this to steal
my money and equipment!

728
00:32:51,692 --> 00:32:55,025
I'll bet you two
planned it together!

729
00:32:55,108 --> 00:32:56,900
[NAOFUMI]
Yeah, come to think of it...

730
00:32:56,983 --> 00:33:00,067
The only thing Myne ever
called me was "Sir Hero,"

731
00:33:00,150 --> 00:33:03,108
but she's calling
Motoyasu by name!

732
00:33:03,192 --> 00:33:05,400
If that's not proof
they were in it together,

733
00:33:05,483 --> 00:33:06,900
I don't know what is!

734
00:33:06,983 --> 00:33:08,525
Refusing to admit he's guilty

735
00:33:08,608 --> 00:33:11,192
and making nonsensical
accusations?

736

I know what you're
thinking and you're right.

737
00:33:13,067 --> 00:33:15,025
He doesn't deserve
a shred of mercy.

738
00:33:15,108 --> 00:33:16,442
[NOBLE 1B]
I knew it.

739
00:33:16,525 --> 00:33:19,317
It was a mistake to summon
all four together at once.

740
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:20,692
[NOBLE 1C]
Exactly.

741
00:33:20,775 --> 00:33:23,067
They shouldn't have summoned
the Shield Hero at all.

742
00:33:23,150 --> 00:33:25,150

known he'd be such scum?

just about the shield?!

Has to be.

745
00:33:30,192 --> 00:33:33,067
Because I'm the Shield Hero.
Because I'm weak.

746
00:33:33,150 --> 00:33:35,317
They're trying to knock me
down in some crazy attempt

747
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:38,233
to make themselves look better.

Disgusting. These people are
all filthy, disgusting trash!

believe in me, either.

away from my home

just to go through this?!

So you're gonna run away as soon
as things start to get tough?

how could you even think
about abandoning your job?

775
00:34:44,317 --> 00:34:47,983
Fight off all the
incoming Waves.

776
00:34:48,067 --> 00:34:49,192
[MOTOYASU]
But, sir!

777
00:34:49,275 --> 00:34:50,275
Does that mean we'll
have to fight alongside

778
00:34:50,358 --> 00:34:51,775
a criminal like him?

779
00:34:51,858 --> 00:34:53,483
[NAOFUMI]
Screw you guys!

780
00:34:54,483 --> 00:34:55,650
Who needs you?!

781
00:34:55,733 --> 00:34:59,900
I'll figure out how to
handle the Waves my way!

782
00:34:59,983 --> 00:35:00,942
Don't move!

783
00:35:01,025 --> 00:35:03,483
[NAOFUMI]
Get the hell off me!

784
00:35:03,567 --> 00:35:04,775
[KNIGHT 1E]
Damn, he's--!

785
00:35:08,275 --> 00:35:09,858
What'll it be, King?

786
00:35:09,942 --> 00:35:12,733
Are you gonna have me rot in
jail in-between every Wave?

787
00:35:12,817 --> 00:35:14,525
There is no more time
before the next Wave,

788
00:35:14,608 --> 00:35:16,192
so I won't be imprisoning you.

789
00:35:16,275 --> 00:35:17,983
Scum or not,
you're still a hero,

790
00:35:18,067 --> 00:35:21,400
and one of the only beings left
who can fight them all off.

791
00:35:21,483 --> 00:35:23,733
But news of your crime
is already spreading

792
00:35:23,817 --> 00:35:24,942
among the people.

793
00:35:25,025 --> 00:35:26,733
That is your punishment.

794
00:35:26,817 --> 00:35:28,317
You should never
expect to be allowed

795
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:30,692
to lead a decent life
in this country.

796
00:35:30,775 --> 00:35:32,317
Yeah, clearly!

797
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:33,483
[coins jingle]

798
00:35:35,942 --> 00:35:37,317
[BOTH gasp]

799
00:35:38,358 --> 00:35:40,983
This is what you wanted, right?

800
00:35:41,067 --> 00:35:42,775
Shove it up your ass!

801
00:35:44,358 --> 00:35:46,525
Hey! Wait one second!

802
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:52,275
I'm the weak one, remember?
I don't have a second to waste.

803
00:36:00,650 --> 00:36:04,025
[NAOFUMI] And just like that,
all my money, my respect,

804
00:36:04,108 --> 00:36:05,900
and my trust was gone.

805
00:36:05,983 --> 00:36:07,650
I lost everything.

806
00:36:15,733 --> 00:36:17,983
[ERHARDT]
Hey, Shield bro.

807
00:36:20,192 --> 00:36:22,942
So I heard what you did to
that girl you were with.

808
00:36:23,025 --> 00:36:25,442
I oughtta punch you in the face!

809
00:36:25,525 --> 00:36:27,358
You're against me, too?

810
00:36:27,442 --> 00:36:30,275
Huh. Hang on.

811
00:36:31,608 --> 00:36:34,567
What gives? I thought you
were all ready to punch me.

812
00:36:34,650 --> 00:36:36,233
Nah, changed my mind.

813
00:36:36,317 --> 00:36:39,275
Good, you were about to
lose your life there.

814
00:36:39,358 --> 00:36:40,858
Hold up a second.

815
00:36:45,608 --> 00:36:47,733
You won't make it very
far dressed like that.

816
00:36:47,817 --> 00:36:50,150
Consider this a parting gift.

817
00:36:50,233 --> 00:36:51,858
How much?

818
00:36:51,942 --> 00:36:53,400
Doesn't matter
since you're broke,

819
00:36:53,483 --> 00:36:56,400
but let's call it a clearance
sale and say five copper.

820
00:36:56,483 --> 00:36:58,775
[NAOFUMI]
Yeah, fine.

821
00:36:58,858 --> 00:37:00,817
I'll come pay you someday.

822
00:37:02,233 --> 00:37:05,025
[ERHARDT]
Sure, kid. Don't die.

823
00:37:12,067 --> 00:37:13,358
[NAOFUMI growls]

[yelling]

826
00:37:37,025 --> 00:37:40,650
[NAOFUMI] I finally hit Level 2,
but I had to fight all night.

827
00:37:56,275 --> 00:37:58,858
[MERCHANT 1A] Let's see,
for these little things?

828
00:37:58,942 --> 00:38:01,317
How does one copper
for every pair sound?

829
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:03,567
Yeah, sure, you got
yourself a deal.

830
00:38:03,650 --> 00:38:05,358
[MERCHANT 1A chuckles]
Splendid.

831
00:38:07,233 --> 00:38:09,067
[MERCHANT 1A]
Thanks, come again.

Welcome, sir.

[MERCHANT 1A gasps]

835
00:38:15,983 --> 00:38:18,233
How much for all of these?

836
00:38:18,317 --> 00:38:21,650
[MERCHANT 1A]
Oh. Orange Balloons, are they?

837
00:38:21,733 --> 00:38:24,025
Looks like 20 of
them by my count.

838
00:38:24,108 --> 00:38:27,108
How does one copper sound
for the entire lot sound?

839
00:38:28,108 --> 00:38:29,358
[NAOFUMI]
I heard you offer the last guy

840
00:38:29,442 --> 00:38:32,192
one copper for every two.

841
00:38:32,275 --> 00:38:34,525
Did I now? I don't recall that.

842
00:38:34,608 --> 00:38:37,233
You must understand,
I do have a business to run.

843
00:38:37,317 --> 00:38:38,942
[NAOFUMI]
That so?

844
00:38:39,025 --> 00:38:42,567
Can I assume that these will
fetch a better price, then?

845
00:38:42,650 --> 00:38:44,692
They're quite lively.

846
00:38:44,775 --> 00:38:46,400
[MERCHANT 1A screaming]

847
00:38:46,483 --> 00:38:48,233
[MERCHANT 1A]
Stop! Wait!

848
00:38:48,317 --> 00:38:50,317
Look, I'm not tryin'
to rip you off here.

849
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,858
All I'm asking of you
is a fair market price.

850
00:38:52,942 --> 00:38:54,358
Is it personal?

851
00:38:54,442 --> 00:38:56,775
Is there maybe some reason
you might have for hating me?

852
00:38:56,858 --> 00:38:58,608
[MERCHANT 1A]
Okay, fine! I give up!

853
00:38:58,692 --> 00:39:01,983
Whatever you want!
Get these things off of me!

854
00:39:02,067 --> 00:39:04,025
Sounds like we have
a deal, then, huh?

855
00:39:04,108 --> 00:39:05,442
If you buy from me consistently,

856
00:39:05,525 --> 00:39:07,650
I'll even give you
a small discount.

857
00:39:07,733 --> 00:39:09,692
Better than tryin'
to fleece me, right?

858
00:39:09,775 --> 00:39:11,775
[MERCHANT 1A]
Right! Consider it done, sir!

859
00:39:11,858 --> 00:39:13,775
And as much as I'd
like to refuse,

860
00:39:13,858 --> 00:39:15,692
the exchange of money for
goods have nothing to do

861
00:39:15,775 --> 00:39:18,400
with any crimes you may
or may not have committed.

862
00:39:18,483 --> 00:39:19,567
And one more thing.

863
00:39:19,650 --> 00:39:20,942
You need to spread
the word around

864
00:39:21,025 --> 00:39:22,608
to all of the other merchants.

865
00:39:22,692 --> 00:39:24,692
Tell 'em that any trader
who messes with me

866
00:39:24,775 --> 00:39:26,817
will get totally
covered in bite marks.

867
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:29,233
Don't you worry.
I'll tell everybody.

868
00:39:29,317 --> 00:39:31,650
To a fruitful relationship.

869
00:39:44,233 --> 00:39:45,192
[ERHARDT]
Hm?

870
00:39:59,650 --> 00:40:01,067
Huh?

871
00:40:01,150 --> 00:40:02,650
Aren't these...?

872
00:40:15,525 --> 00:40:16,608
New shields.

873
00:40:16,692 --> 00:40:18,650
So does that mean by
mastering abilities,

874
00:40:18,733 --> 00:40:22,483
I get to keep them even after
I upgrade to another one?

875
00:40:23,567 --> 00:40:25,775
Leaf Shield, go.

876
00:40:32,317 --> 00:40:34,817
It really is just like a game.

877
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:42,608
It can improve
the plant's quality?

878
00:40:46,983 --> 00:40:49,483
[HERBALIST 1A]
Wow, this is really good stuff.

879
00:40:49,567 --> 00:40:51,067
Where did you find these?

880
00:40:51,150 --> 00:40:53,400
[NAOFUMI] In the forest
right outside the castle.

881
00:40:53,483 --> 00:40:54,900
Didn't you know?

882
00:40:54,983 --> 00:40:58,900
Sure. But I've never seen
anything of such high quality.

883
00:40:58,983 --> 00:41:01,650
I was certain it was
much more average.

884
00:41:07,942 --> 00:41:09,358
[NAOFUMI groans]

885
00:41:09,442 --> 00:41:12,650
[NAOFUMI] Since that day,
nothing I eat has any flavor.

886
00:41:12,733 --> 00:41:14,775
[BRIGAND 1A]
O great Shield Hero.

887
00:41:14,858 --> 00:41:17,150
We'll join your
party if you want.

888
00:41:17,233 --> 00:41:20,150
Yeah, that's right.
Thank your lucky stars!

889
00:41:22,025 --> 00:41:25,817
Okay. But how 'bout we go ahead
and discuss the terms up front?

890
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:26,858
[BRIGAND 1B chuckles]

891
00:41:26,942 --> 00:41:28,317
Sure thing!

892
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:31,025
[NAOFUMI] Your pay will be
entirely performance-based.

893
00:41:31,108 --> 00:41:32,317
Do you know what that means?

894
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:33,900
[BRIGAND 1A]
Nope, not a clue!

895
00:41:33,983 --> 00:41:35,733
[BRIGAND 1A, BRIGAND 1C laugh]

896
00:41:35,817 --> 00:41:37,650
[NAOFUMI] It means you'll
be paid according to the loot

897
00:41:37,733 --> 00:41:39,567
we get on our quest.

898
00:41:39,650 --> 00:41:44,233
And since I'm the leader,
I'll be keeping at least 40%.

899
00:41:44,317 --> 00:41:47,525
I'll split up the rest among
you guys at my discretion.

900
00:41:47,608 --> 00:41:48,900
If you do nothing of value,

901
00:41:48,983 --> 00:41:51,483
then you can expect
to be paid nothing.

902
00:41:51,567 --> 00:41:52,733
What the hell?

903
00:41:52,817 --> 00:41:54,317
That means if you get
a wild hair up your ass,

904
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:56,567
you could end up keepin'
it all for yourself!

905
00:41:56,650 --> 00:41:59,233
[NAOFUMI] I promise to
pay you if you do your job.

906
00:41:59,317 --> 00:42:01,983
Assuming you can.

907
00:42:02,067 --> 00:42:05,233
[BRIGAND 1B] Let's go get us
some equipment, boss-man!

908
00:42:05,317 --> 00:42:07,567
[NAOFUMI]
Buy your own equipment.

909
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:10,400
I have nothing to gain
by doing that for you.

910
00:42:10,483 --> 00:42:11,817
[BRIGAND 1B]
What?!

911
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:14,358
Forget the party crap and
just hand over your money.

912
00:42:14,442 --> 00:42:16,650
Now, see? If you'd only
said that to begin with,

913
00:42:16,733 --> 00:42:18,858
you could've saved us all
a whole buncha time.

914
00:42:18,942 --> 00:42:22,150
Heh. Yeah, right?
Who knew it'd be so easy?

915
00:42:22,817 --> 00:42:25,692
[BRIGAND 1B gasps, screams]

916
00:42:25,775 --> 00:42:27,692
[BRIGAND 1A]
Chill out!

917
00:42:34,108 --> 00:42:35,483
[BRIGAND 1B]
Shit!

[BRIGANDS yelling]

919
00:42:41,108 --> 00:42:44,233
I have real good defense,
but no offensive ability.

920
00:42:44,317 --> 00:42:46,817
Without it, I can't
defeat monsters.

921
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:50,233
And because of that, I can't
farm experience points.

922
00:42:50,317 --> 00:42:51,400
And since I can't farm,

923
00:42:51,483 --> 00:42:54,233
I can never raise
my offensive ability.

924
00:42:54,317 --> 00:42:56,400
I'm stuck in a loop!

925
00:42:56,483 --> 00:42:57,608
Damn it!

926
00:43:04,025 --> 00:43:06,275
[SLAVE TRADER] Looks like
you could use some help.

927
00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:11,483
[chuckles]

928
00:43:11,567 --> 00:43:13,525
[SLAVE TRADER]
It's clear you don't have any.

929
00:43:13,608 --> 00:43:16,483
What luck. I have
exactly what you need.

930
00:43:16,567 --> 00:43:19,025
If you're offering me
party members, I'll pass.

931
00:43:19,108 --> 00:43:20,983
[SLAVE TRADER]
Party members? No, no.

932
00:43:21,067 --> 00:43:22,775
What I'm offering
you is a service

933
00:43:22,858 --> 00:43:26,233
I believe you'll find
far more convenient.

934
00:43:26,317 --> 00:43:27,942
And what would that be?

935
00:43:28,025 --> 00:43:29,775
Interested, are we?

936
00:43:29,858 --> 00:43:31,192
Leave me alone.

937
00:43:31,275 --> 00:43:32,692
[SLAVE TRADER laughs]

938
00:43:32,775 --> 00:43:35,817
You've got that look in
your eyes that I just adore.

939
00:43:35,900 --> 00:43:38,608
You're every bit the man
the rumors said you'd be.

940
00:43:38,692 --> 00:43:41,275
Rumors, huh? So then,
you know who I am?

941
00:43:41,358 --> 00:43:44,858
[SLAVE TRADER] Of course
I do, brave Shield Hero, sir.

942
00:43:44,942 --> 00:43:46,525
If my offer interests you,

943
00:43:46,608 --> 00:43:49,400
follow me and we can
discuss it further.

944
00:44:01,567 --> 00:44:03,233
[SLAVE TRADER]
Right this way.

945
00:44:05,442 --> 00:44:09,108
[NAOFUMI] So, what exactly
are you offering me here?

946
00:44:09,192 --> 00:44:12,192
[chuckles] Can't you tell
by just looking?

947
00:44:12,275 --> 00:44:13,900
They're slaves, my boy!

948
00:44:13,983 --> 00:44:15,483
No way.

949
00:44:15,567 --> 00:44:19,858
[SLAVE TRADER chuckles] Yes way.
I run a slave-trading business!

950
00:44:19,942 --> 00:44:23,108
What would make you think
I'd want to own slaves?

951
00:44:23,192 --> 00:44:24,650
[SLAVE TRADER]
Oh, I don't know,

952
00:44:24,733 --> 00:44:27,817
the fact that they can neither
lie nor betray their master?

953
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:29,067
[gasps]

954
00:44:29,150 --> 00:44:30,733
We keep all our slaves in line

955
00:44:30,817 --> 00:44:33,483
by placing them under
the effects of a curse.

956
00:44:33,567 --> 00:44:35,650
A strong, seal-based curse.

957
00:44:35,733 --> 00:44:38,483
If they misbehave,
it can take their very lives.

958
00:44:38,567 --> 00:44:39,400
[NAOFUMI]
Hmm...

959
00:44:39,483 --> 00:44:41,317
[SLAVE TRADER]
Whaddaya say?

960
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:43,858
All right, show me
what you've got.

961
00:44:43,942 --> 00:44:46,025
I knew you had
exactly what it takes

962
00:44:46,108 --> 00:44:48,900
to be a most wonderful patron.

963
00:44:52,192 --> 00:44:53,942
[NAOFUMI]
Some of them don't look human.

964
00:44:54,025 --> 00:44:57,108
I can assure you they
still are, technically.

965
00:44:57,192 --> 00:44:58,567
[NAOFUMI]
Tell me more.

966
00:44:58,650 --> 00:45:01,150
I don't know much
about this world.

967
00:45:01,233 --> 00:45:04,108
[SLAVE TRADER] Creatures that
look mostly human but aren't

968
00:45:04,192 --> 00:45:06,983
are what we refer
to as "demi-humans."

969
00:45:07,067 --> 00:45:10,858
They're mostly used as
servants or for manual labor.

970
00:45:10,942 --> 00:45:13,067
"Beastmen" are demi-humans
whose appearance

971
00:45:13,150 --> 00:45:15,733
lean more toward
the animal side.

972
00:45:15,817 --> 00:45:17,608
They're often used as bodyguards

973
00:45:17,692 --> 00:45:20,692
or gambled on as participants
in death matches.

974
00:45:20,775 --> 00:45:21,858
[NAOFUMI]
I see.

975
00:45:21,942 --> 00:45:24,067
But they both fall under
the same category?

976
00:45:24,150 --> 00:45:25,400
[SLAVE TRADER]
Indeed.

977
00:45:25,483 --> 00:45:28,525
And since this country
practices human supremacy,

978
00:45:28,608 --> 00:45:31,442
and demi-humans are thought
to be closer to monsters,

979
00:45:31,525 --> 00:45:33,858
life can be quite
hard for them here.

980
00:45:33,942 --> 00:45:36,150
As such, they're
treated as slaves.

981
00:45:36,233 --> 00:45:42,233
