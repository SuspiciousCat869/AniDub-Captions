163
00:10:37,192 --> 00:10:39,108
Feeding my shield
monster fragments

164
00:10:39,192 --> 00:10:41,567
will let me obtain new skills,

165
00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:44,233
but any serious improvement
means Raphtalia and Filo

166
00:10:44,317 --> 00:10:47,108
have to get class
upgrades, and soon.

167
00:10:48,608 --> 00:10:51,150
Excuse me, uh, Sir Hero?

168
00:10:51,233 --> 00:10:52,192
[NAOFUMI]
Yeah?

169
00:10:53,233 --> 00:10:56,233
You are to report to
the royal castle at once.

170
00:10:57,317 --> 00:10:58,733
Huh?

171
00:11:00,317 --> 00:11:01,900
[NAOFUMI]
Shield Prison!

172
00:11:03,817 --> 00:11:05,900
Time for... Change Shield!

173
00:11:11,525 --> 00:11:14,108
[NAOFUMI, DRAGON ZOMBIE]
I cast the Iron Maiden!

174
00:11:29,817 --> 00:11:31,067
[clears throat]

175
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:34,108
I saw what happened
through the crystal ball.

176
00:11:34,192 --> 00:11:39,317
You did well to quell the Wave,
as much as I hate to admit it.

177
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:42,608
[NAOFUMI] Wow, don't be
grateful or anything.

178
00:11:42,692 --> 00:11:44,983
Please, Sir Hero! I beg you!

179
00:11:45,067 --> 00:11:47,567
I know how you feel.
Believe me, I understand!

180
00:11:47,650 --> 00:11:49,442
But please go with the captain!

181
00:11:50,942 --> 00:11:52,858
[sighs]

182
00:11:52,942 --> 00:11:55,358
I have a question for you, Hero.

183
00:11:55,442 --> 00:11:57,233
I want to know exactly
how you obtained

184
00:11:57,317 --> 00:11:58,650
such incredible strength.

185
00:11:58,733 --> 00:12:00,233
Huh?

186
00:12:00,317 --> 00:12:02,567
[AULTCRAY] You possess powers
unbecoming of the Shield Hero.

187
00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:05,650
It is your duty to reveal
the secret behind it.

188
00:12:06,567 --> 00:12:08,192
It's time to spit it out.

189
00:12:08,275 --> 00:12:11,483
And don't you even
think about lying to me.

190
00:12:12,567 --> 00:12:14,067
[AULTCRAY]
Hm?

191
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:16,817
If you wanna know
so badly, come kneel.

192
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:18,650
[KNIGHTS gasp]

193
00:12:18,733 --> 00:12:20,692
Y'see, where I come from,

194
00:12:20,775 --> 00:12:22,233
when someone asks for something,

195
00:12:22,317 --> 00:12:24,858
they usually grovel before the
one who has what they need.

196
00:12:24,942 --> 00:12:26,025
[growls]

197
00:12:26,108 --> 00:12:27,525
[NAOFUMI]
Oh, yeah, and they usually say,

198
00:12:27,608 --> 00:12:30,317
"I beg you. Please deign to
enlighten my ignorant self."

199
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,108
Insolent cur!

200
00:12:32,192 --> 00:12:34,858
As things stand now,
if I wanted,

201
00:12:34,942 --> 00:12:37,442
I could kill you right here
and walk straight out the door.

202
00:12:37,525 --> 00:12:39,608
You're bluffing and you know it!

203
00:12:40,692 --> 00:12:42,442
[KNIGHTS gasp]

204
00:12:42,525 --> 00:12:45,108
If any of you want to
fight me, go right ahead.

205
00:12:45,192 --> 00:12:48,192
But I killed the Wave's
number one monster.

206
00:12:48,275 --> 00:12:49,650
[KNIGHTS gasp]

207
00:12:52,817 --> 00:12:54,233
[growls]

208
00:12:55,525 --> 00:12:57,025
I'm willing to
cooperate with you

209
00:12:57,108 --> 00:13:00,817
only until the Waves die down,
and then I'm going back home.

210
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:03,692
And don't even think
of calling me again.

211
00:13:04,942 --> 00:13:06,275
I-I'm the king!

212
00:13:06,358 --> 00:13:09,483
I forbid you to disrespect
me this way, Shield!

213
00:13:09,567 --> 00:13:11,067
[gasps]

214
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:12,400
I know what to do.

215
00:13:12,483 --> 00:13:15,025
Those slaves of yours
will pay for your crimes.

216
00:13:15,108 --> 00:13:17,233
Don't think you can get
out of this that easily!

217
00:13:17,317 --> 00:13:18,608
[NAOFUMI]
Huh?

218
00:13:18,692 --> 00:13:19,858
[AULTCRAY gasps]

219
00:13:20,817 --> 00:13:22,233
You can use all the dirty,

220
00:13:22,317 --> 00:13:24,608
underhanded tricks
you can think of.

221
00:13:24,692 --> 00:13:28,108
I'll protect my team
no matter what you do.

222
00:13:28,192 --> 00:13:31,192
You'll never take
anything from me again.

223
00:13:31,275 --> 00:13:34,025
I dare you to lay
a finger on them.

224
00:13:34,108 --> 00:13:36,400
I'll chase you to
the ends of the earth

225
00:13:36,483 --> 00:13:38,817
and make you regret
ever being born!

226
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:41,358
[AULTCRAY growls]

227
00:13:44,567 --> 00:13:48,692
Accursed Shield!

228
00:13:57,442 --> 00:14:00,858
You did well this time,
I daresay, Shield Hero.

229
00:14:00,942 --> 00:14:02,108
I daresay.

230
00:14:02,192 --> 00:14:03,317
Huh?

231
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,400
Your efforts have
become, shall we say,

232
00:14:05,483 --> 00:14:06,942
somewhat impossible for anyone

233
00:14:07,025 --> 00:14:09,317
to reasonably
ignore any longer.

234
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:11,067
Including certain powers who,

235
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:13,275
to put it mildly,
aren't taking too kindly

236
00:14:13,358 --> 00:14:16,317
to your interference, Sir Hero.

237
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:18,025
Virtuous on the surface,

238
00:14:18,108 --> 00:14:21,525
conniving and conspiring
behind the scenes...

239
00:14:21,608 --> 00:14:23,817
You should exercise
the utmost caution

240
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:27,317
going forward,
I daresay. Understood?

241
00:14:33,358 --> 00:14:34,733
"Daresay"?

242
00:14:36,858 --> 00:14:40,358
[AULTCRAY] Aha, Melty!
What can I do for you?

243
00:14:41,525 --> 00:14:43,317
I was told that you
and the Shield Hero

244
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,817
had a conversation just now.

245
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:46,150
Is that right, Father?

246
00:14:46,233 --> 00:14:47,567
Huh? Uh?

247
00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:49,900
And I was also told that
the conversation ended

248
00:14:49,983 --> 00:14:51,942
in a very hostile manner.

249
00:14:52,025 --> 00:14:53,775
[AULTCRAY groans]

250
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:57,942
[MELTY] Father, if you remain
at odds with the Shield Hero,

251
00:14:58,025 --> 00:15:00,567
we may lose our only means
of fighting the Waves,

252
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:03,900
which could threaten the safety
of our entire country!

253
00:15:03,983 --> 00:15:06,525
Please try to
reconcile with him!

254
00:15:06,608 --> 00:15:08,483
Reconcile with that swine?!

255
00:15:08,567 --> 00:15:09,858
[gasps]

256
00:15:09,942 --> 00:15:13,317
O-Oh, don't worry, my dear,
I'm not angry at you.

257
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:14,983
I just don't understand, Father.

258
00:15:15,067 --> 00:15:18,067
Why do you hate the
Shield Hero so much?

259
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:20,400
It's just that...

260
00:15:20,483 --> 00:15:22,817
If he and his demi-humans
do as they please,

261
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:25,358
I'll lose my family again.

262
00:15:25,442 --> 00:15:26,775
Father, I, uh--

263
00:15:26,858 --> 00:15:27,817
[door opens]

264
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:29,942
[MYNE]
Your defiance is an affront.

265
00:15:30,025 --> 00:15:31,400
[MELTY]
Hm?

266
00:15:31,483 --> 00:15:35,108
[MYNE] With the queen away,
the king's word is final.

267
00:15:35,192 --> 00:15:38,775
And not even we princesses
can go against it.

268
00:15:38,858 --> 00:15:40,817
Sister, I...

269
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:43,775
[MYNE]
Our father is the king.

270
00:15:43,858 --> 00:15:46,025
Whether you understand
his decisions or not,

271
00:15:46,108 --> 00:15:48,983
they all have the betterment
of our country at heart.

272
00:15:49,067 --> 00:15:50,567
I realize that you're
still at an age

273
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:52,275
where you want him to
baby you, of course.

274
00:15:52,358 --> 00:15:54,317
I was once small
like you, too.

275
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:57,025
But you really should learn
to hold back a little,

276
00:15:57,108 --> 00:15:58,942
dear Melty.

277
00:15:59,025 --> 00:16:01,692
Just a word of advice
from your big sis.

278
00:16:01,775 --> 00:16:04,150
I appreciate your concern
and I'm grateful,

279
00:16:04,233 --> 00:16:05,483
but you see, Big Sister,

280
00:16:05,567 --> 00:16:07,317
this is really none
of your business.

281
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,525
[MYNE grunts]

282
00:16:08,608 --> 00:16:10,108
Just like our mother and father,

283
00:16:10,192 --> 00:16:12,650
I only want what's best for
our subjects and our country.

284
00:16:12,733 --> 00:16:13,900
You understand.

285
00:16:13,983 --> 00:16:16,942
So, you see, it is
my job as crown princess

286
00:16:17,025 --> 00:16:19,733
to see that everything
is put right.

287
00:16:19,817 --> 00:16:21,983
Oh, Melty, you little...

288
00:16:22,067 --> 00:16:23,858
[AULTCRAY sputtering]

289
00:16:23,942 --> 00:16:25,942
[MELTY]
I'll take my leave now, Father.

290
00:16:26,025 --> 00:16:28,608
[AULTCRAY gasps]

291
00:16:28,692 --> 00:16:30,192
Melty, please, I--

292
00:16:30,275 --> 00:16:31,275
[MYNE]
Papa.

293
00:16:31,358 --> 00:16:33,317
[sighs]

294
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:40,067
[MYNE growling]

295
00:16:53,525 --> 00:16:55,400
[ERHARDT] I can't believe
you actually went spoiling

296
00:16:55,483 --> 00:16:57,442
for a fight with the king!

297
00:16:57,525 --> 00:16:59,150
Well, better get
your facts straight.

298
00:16:59,233 --> 00:17:00,442
He picked the fight.

299
00:17:00,525 --> 00:17:02,483
Whatever. You can do
all your shopping here

300
00:17:02,567 --> 00:17:04,775
since I've got everything.

301
00:17:04,858 --> 00:17:07,983
But wait a sec. What about
the class upgrades?

302
00:17:08,067 --> 00:17:09,567
Based on everything you've said,

303
00:17:09,650 --> 00:17:13,067
it's unlikely they'll let you
use the dragon hourglass here.

304
00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:14,358
[NAOFUMI] I was thinking
of going to either

305
00:17:14,442 --> 00:17:17,067
Siltvelt or Shieldfreeden.

306
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:20,108
[ERHARDT] I always figured you'd
go to those places someday.

307
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:23,733
[ERHARDT]
I recommend Shieldfreeden.

308
00:17:23,817 --> 00:17:25,192
Interesting,
that's the same place

309
00:17:25,275 --> 00:17:27,233
the slave merchant
told me to go to.

310
00:17:27,317 --> 00:17:28,733
He said for a
country of demi-humans,

311
00:17:28,817 --> 00:17:30,400
it's quite welcoming to humans.

312
00:17:30,483 --> 00:17:31,817
[ERHARDT]
Yeah.

313
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:34,692
Over in Siltvelt, they
can get pretty extreme

314
00:17:34,775 --> 00:17:38,733
about demi-human supremacy.
But, as the Shield Hero--

315
00:17:38,817 --> 00:17:39,858
Master, are we--

316
00:17:39,942 --> 00:17:41,733
Are we really going
on another trip?

317
00:17:41,817 --> 00:17:42,942
[NAOFUMI]
Mm-hm.

318
00:17:43,025 --> 00:17:45,067
We're going on a trip!

319
00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:47,400
Normally, it takes
about four weeks,

320
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:49,942
but I'm pretty sure she'll
get you there in less time.

321
00:17:50,025 --> 00:17:52,275
I'll get everything ya need
loaded up on your wagon.

322
00:17:52,358 --> 00:17:54,317
You're gonna have to
get goin' pretty quick.

323
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,400
Oh, and, um, I'd like a
new sword for Raphtalia--

324
00:17:56,483 --> 00:17:58,733
Master Naofumi,
I already have a spare.

325
00:17:58,817 --> 00:17:59,775
Wait a sec.

326
00:17:59,858 --> 00:18:01,692
This is going to be
a long journey.

327
00:18:01,775 --> 00:18:03,400
We should try to save money.

328
00:18:03,483 --> 00:18:04,817
--[NAOFUMI sighs]
--[FILO giggles]

329
00:18:07,733 --> 00:18:10,775
[RAPHTALIA] Erhardt is always so
fast and organized, isn't he?

330
00:18:10,858 --> 00:18:14,233
We wouldn't have been able to
leave so quickly otherwise.

331
00:18:14,317 --> 00:18:15,358
Yep.

332
00:18:19,150 --> 00:18:20,317
Huh?

333
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,483
[ERHARDT] Just thought
I'd put in some gifts

334
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:24,733
for the road, kid.
Use 'em if ya like.

335
00:18:24,817 --> 00:18:27,150
They may prove useful
on your journey.

336
00:18:28,192 --> 00:18:30,442
[ERHARDT]
For you, a shield accessory.

337
00:18:30,525 --> 00:18:31,858
It can analyze any shield,

338
00:18:31,942 --> 00:18:34,358
besides doing tons
of other useful stuff.

339
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,942
[ERHARDT] For the little
missy, a brand new sword.

340
00:18:39,025 --> 00:18:41,900
It's the same make
as the one she broke.

341
00:18:41,983 --> 00:18:44,442
Nothing beats a trusty
old friend, right?

342
00:18:44,525 --> 00:18:46,900
I put in another
one for her, too.

343
00:18:46,983 --> 00:18:48,358
A mana sword.

344
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:51,358
[ERHARDT] For enemies
with no physical body.

345
00:18:51,442 --> 00:18:52,692
[BOTH]
Hm?

346
00:18:54,983 --> 00:18:56,567
[ERHARDT] If, God forbid,
your feathered lassie

347
00:18:56,650 --> 00:18:58,233
can't draw the wagon anymore,

348
00:18:58,317 --> 00:19:00,900
this little item
will come in handy.

349
00:19:00,983 --> 00:19:02,067
She puts this on,

350
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:04,275
she'll gain the strength
of a hundred men!

351
00:19:04,358 --> 00:19:06,567
Even you could
draw the wagon, kid!

352
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:08,275
[NAOFUMI]
Hmm.

353
00:19:08,358 --> 00:19:10,858
Ooh. [giggles]

354
00:19:20,733 --> 00:19:22,233
[groans]

355
00:19:22,317 --> 00:19:23,442
[NAOFUMI chuckles]

356
00:19:23,525 --> 00:19:24,567
[FILO whines]

357
00:19:24,650 --> 00:19:26,108
[NAOFUMI exhales]

358
00:19:27,942 --> 00:19:29,692
[NAOFUMI]
I love traveling.

359
00:19:29,775 --> 00:19:32,775
It makes me feel free,
shackled by no one.

360
00:19:32,858 --> 00:19:35,900
No royalty to deal with,
not even the other heroes.

361
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:38,817
[MELTY]
Found you!

362
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:41,358
[groans, sighs]

363
00:19:46,525 --> 00:19:48,775
Huh? It's Mel!

364
00:19:48,858 --> 00:19:50,275
Hey, we're over here, Mel!

365
00:19:50,358 --> 00:19:51,692
--[NAOFUMI] Filo...
--It's so good to see you!

366
00:19:51,775 --> 00:19:54,983
Master Naofumi, I know
it wasn't very long,

367
00:19:55,067 --> 00:19:57,650
but we did travel
together as a team.

368
00:19:57,733 --> 00:19:59,775
Mel's a good person, you know?

369
00:19:59,858 --> 00:20:01,358
She really is!

370
00:20:12,275 --> 00:20:15,942
Sir Shield Hero,
I have a request.

371
00:20:16,025 --> 00:20:17,233
Please return to the capital

372
00:20:17,317 --> 00:20:18,942
and speak with
King Aultcray again.

373
00:20:19,025 --> 00:20:20,108
Not a chance.

374
00:20:20,192 --> 00:20:21,150
[MELTY gasps]

375
00:20:23,983 --> 00:20:27,275
I want you to apologize for
your conduct and reconcile.

376
00:20:27,358 --> 00:20:28,317
Forget it!

377
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,525
[groans]

378
00:20:30,608 --> 00:20:32,442
We need your help, Sir Hero.

379
00:20:32,525 --> 00:20:34,858
We just can't stop
the Waves without you.

380
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:36,192
Besides, you'd be nowhere

381
00:20:36,275 --> 00:20:38,108
without the king's
financial help.

382
00:20:38,192 --> 00:20:39,358
Don't you understand?

383
00:20:39,442 --> 00:20:41,400
What financial help?

384
00:20:41,483 --> 00:20:44,233
I'm the one who's graciously
working with you guys--

385
00:20:44,317 --> 00:20:46,858
only until all the Waves
are gone, that is.

386
00:20:49,483 --> 00:20:51,858
Master Naofumi...

387
00:20:51,942 --> 00:20:53,358
She's royalty, too.

388
00:20:53,442 --> 00:20:54,608
[RAPHTALIA groans]

389
00:20:54,692 --> 00:20:55,483
[MELTY]
Why...?

390
00:20:55,567 --> 00:20:56,900
[BOTH]
Huh?

391
00:20:56,983 --> 00:20:59,275
Why do both you and my father
have to act this way?

392
00:20:59,358 --> 00:21:00,442
It's ridiculous!

393
00:21:00,525 --> 00:21:01,983
[ALL gasp]

394
00:21:02,067 --> 00:21:04,775
A hero and the king can't be
fighting among themselves!

395
00:21:04,858 --> 00:21:06,233
Absolutely not!

396
00:21:06,317 --> 00:21:07,483
[FILO]
Mel?

397
00:21:07,567 --> 00:21:09,567
Don't you agree with me,
Filo? Isn't this silly?!

398
00:21:09,650 --> 00:21:10,608
[FILO]
Uh...

399
00:21:10,692 --> 00:21:12,525
You agree, don't you,
Raphtalia?!

400
00:21:12,608 --> 00:21:13,983
Well, um, actually,

401
00:21:14,067 --> 00:21:16,608
I am Master Naofumi's
sword, you know.

402
00:21:16,692 --> 00:21:19,150
You see? They agree
with me--both of them!

403
00:21:19,233 --> 00:21:20,608
Actually, they don't.

404
00:21:20,692 --> 00:21:23,733
Look, just apologize to
Father, just this once!

405
00:21:23,817 --> 00:21:25,608
Otherwise, Mother's
going to yell at him

406
00:21:25,692 --> 00:21:27,858
when she comes back!

407
00:21:27,942 --> 00:21:30,983
[NAOFUMI] She throws a
tantrum just like her dad.

408
00:21:31,067 --> 00:21:34,900
Huh? Wait, what?
Her mother will yell at him?

409
00:21:34,983 --> 00:21:37,858
You listen to me when
I'm talking to you!

410
00:21:37,942 --> 00:21:39,567
[sighs]

411
00:21:43,067 --> 00:21:44,400
[NAOFUMI]
Huh?

[gasps]

413
00:21:48,942 --> 00:21:50,692
[NAOFUMI]
This feeling...

414
00:21:50,775 --> 00:21:52,858
It's the same as
that other time.

415
00:21:53,733 --> 00:21:54,733
[NAOFUMI]
This whole thing--

416
00:21:54,817 --> 00:21:56,858
it reeks of a setup.

417
00:22:01,150 --> 00:22:02,608
[NAOFUMI gasps]

418
00:22:08,025 --> 00:22:08,983
So return to--
