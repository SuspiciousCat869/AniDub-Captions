[TOI] My brother
sacrificed everything.

All to protect me.

00:00:21,333 --> 00:00:23,583
He never even gave it
a second thought.

4
00:00:23,666 --> 00:00:25,666
Now I'm going to give up
what I love.

5
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:27,166
Just like I did before.

Why'd you throw it away?

00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,583
You hate soccer?

10
00:00:41,666 --> 00:00:43,458
[YOUNG TOI] No,
but if I don't leave it behind,

11
00:00:43,541 --> 00:00:45,625
I can never move on.

12
00:00:45,708 --> 00:00:48,000
[YOUNG KAZUKI]
That's like me, I guess.

13
00:00:49,375 --> 00:00:52,666
I'm not really connected
to anyone, after all.

14
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:54,750
[YOUNG TOI] People don't realize
who they're connected to

15
00:00:54,833 --> 00:00:56,708
until they lose them.

16
00:00:56,791 --> 00:01:00,333
I have to protect
the connections I have left,

17
00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:02,750
and that means giving up soccer.

Of course he wouldn't remember.

Chikai! What happened?
Are you okay?

25
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:33,833
For right now. But I think
someone sniffed out

our little incident
from four years back.

Don't tell me you're still

I'm not.

[CHIKAI]
Well, either way,

31
00:01:45,125 --> 00:01:46,708
there's one thing
you gotta remember.

Just like you need me,
I need you, too.

[CHIKAI]
Mm.

No! Wait! I'm not backing out!

00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:06,708
I've made up my mind.

41
00:02:06,791 --> 00:02:10,666
I just gotta make sure
my friends are okay.

Damn it, Kazuki! You traitor!

Man, why does everything suck?

[CHIKAI]
Well, when everything sucks,

53
00:04:14,666 --> 00:04:16,583
then you throw it all away.

54
00:04:16,666 --> 00:04:18,458
You only get one shot at life,
after all.

That means no do-overs

this fraudster guy

was working out of Tama.
Why is it our case?

68

He operates elsewhere,
but lives here.

Fine. So?

he's also wanted in connection

to a fatal shooting
four years ago.

If we capture him, we can easily
make him into a kappa zombie.

He lied to us.

Can't hardly blame him, though.

throw away something

He quit soccer because of me.

153

He was serious, too.

160
00:09:07,541 --> 00:09:09,041
Well, he really liked
that thing,

161
00:09:09,125 --> 00:09:10,625
but I think he said
he gave it away.

162
00:09:10,708 --> 00:09:12,625
To who?
Who did he give it to?

163
00:09:12,708 --> 00:09:14,791
The hell if I know! Chill out.

164
00:09:14,875 --> 00:09:17,875
He just wanted someone
to remember him, that's all.

165
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:21,708
To understand how much
playing soccer meant to him.

166
00:09:21,791 --> 00:09:24,708
I'm telling you,
that's kid's too serious.

167
00:09:24,791 --> 00:09:27,000
He'd do anything
if he thought it might help me.

168
00:09:27,083 --> 00:09:30,833
He'd get his hands dirty,
put his life at risk...

169
00:09:30,916 --> 00:09:32,708
Not that I'd ever
ask him to do that.

170
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:35,791
[ENTA]
I'm the same way.

171
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:39,750
There's nothing
I wouldn't do for Kazuki.

172
00:09:39,833 --> 00:09:40,750
[CHIKAI]
Hmm.

173
00:09:40,833 --> 00:09:42,541
Not that any of that matters.

174
00:09:42,625 --> 00:09:45,083
It's all for nothing
if he doesn't even care.

175
00:09:45,166 --> 00:09:47,791
Don't worry about
how they feel. Think about you.

176
00:09:47,875 --> 00:09:50,083
If it makes you happy,

177
00:09:50,166 --> 00:09:52,541
if it makes your life easier,
do it.

That's right, you are.

Look! There's a man down!

Uh-oh, guess we're in trouble.

00:12:13,291 --> 00:12:16,083
He's dead.
Did you shoot this man?

00:12:16,166 --> 00:12:18,500
Don't know if this passes
for self-defense!

[OFFICER 1] Hey, say something
already! What did you--

236
00:12:21,916 --> 00:12:24,250
[OFFICER 2]
It was the fugitive. Kuji.

How do you know that?

238
00:12:26,625 --> 00:12:28,875
It was the murder
from four years ago.

239

This man came for revenge.

240

Exactly!

241
00:12:31,708 --> 00:12:33,625

Chikai Kuji. The fugitive.

[REO chuckles softly]

247
00:12:51,916 --> 00:12:54,791
[SARA] I've been watching them
for the past few days.

00:12:54,875 --> 00:12:57,125
And I'm convinced
that they're the ones

249
00:12:57,208 --> 00:12:58,750
who captured Dark Keppi.

250

There's no doubt.
