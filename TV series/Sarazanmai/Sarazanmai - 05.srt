I was a little uneasy at first,

322
00:17:42,025 --> 00:17:43,692
but the more I talked to her,

323
00:17:43,775 --> 00:17:46,983
the more I felt like she really
was my mom, after all.

The truth is,

325
00:17:50,025 --> 00:17:53,525
I have another family
I love just as much as you.

326

It's selfish, but...

00:17:55,775 --> 00:17:57,233
but I couldn't help it.

328
00:17:57,317 --> 00:17:59,233
I had to see you.

329
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:09,025
You know,
I really love my family, too.

[KAZUKI] If you don't mind,
can we keep this our secret?

I'll see you off

Don't go away!
At least take me with you!

nothing to do with you!

I have so much regret.

Like Kuji said.
I just keep hurting him.

Like that accident
wasn't enough.

An accident. Not your fault.

It's not like you
did it on purpose.

I'm the one
who screwed all this up!

But nobody will blame me!

365

It's all a lie.
My whole family, it's all fake.

366
00:20:12,733 --> 00:20:14,942
Then they act like
everything's fine,

like they're just waiting
for me to get over it.

00:20:17,775 --> 00:20:20,233
But as soon as I see
Haruka's wheelchair,

369
00:20:20,317 --> 00:20:22,525
I can't even breathe.

370
00:20:22,608 --> 00:20:27,233
I thought if I quit soccer,
something might change, but no.

371
00:20:27,317 --> 00:20:29,650
I stole Nyantaro.

I pretended to be Sara,
all for Haruka.

Just so I could...

No, that's not true.

375
00:20:38,858 --> 00:20:41,192
I was just protecting myself.

That's why I lied to him.

Huh. Yeah, I wonder about that.

If you ask me, you're just
