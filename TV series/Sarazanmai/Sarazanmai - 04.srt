Just one more day,
huh, Haruka?

[HARUKA]
Uh-huh.

And here's something else
for you to noodle over.

21

As long as we keep
our secret, I'm happy.

Yeah, I know. But you still
saved this dumb place.

43

That's why I decided
to wait here.

44

[CHIKAI]
On a more positive note,

45
00:03:42,192 --> 00:03:45,192
I might be able to
stop by soon.

46
00:03:45,275 --> 00:03:47,942
And when it's time to leave,
can I finally come with you?

47
00:03:48,025 --> 00:03:49,608
[CHIKAI]
Well, no promises.

48
00:03:49,692 --> 00:03:51,108
But you did promise!

49
00:03:51,192 --> 00:03:53,400
You said we could live together
once things were settled.

50
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:55,358
I'm sick of being
apart from you.

[CHIKAI]
Yeah, I know. I'm sorry.

[TOI'S AUNT] Toi, one of your
friends is here to see you.

55
00:04:08,108 --> 00:04:10,775
You make me worry,
going out late every night.

56
00:04:10,858 --> 00:04:12,900
You're not getting into
something dangerous, I hope.

Don't bother.
He's not gonna listen to us.

to cut ties

of his, then he's a lost cause.

[TOI]
Oh, you.

[ENTA]
Just so you know,

62
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:25,858
I only told them I'm your
friend, so you'd come out.

63
00:04:25,942 --> 00:04:27,608
[TOI]
Yeah, yeah.

64
00:04:28,858 --> 00:04:31,108
[ENTA] So, your family
runs a soba shop?

65
00:04:31,192 --> 00:04:32,650
I never would have guessed.

66
00:04:32,733 --> 00:04:34,067
Funny thing, this is where

67
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:36,525
my parents get
their New Year's Eve soba.

68
00:04:36,608 --> 00:04:38,942
What I'm saying is,
it's pretty good.

Thanks, I guess.

70
00:04:40,525 --> 00:04:43,775
Wait. But you only moved
here recently, didn't you?

71
00:04:43,858 --> 00:04:45,192
Why's that?

72
00:04:47,817 --> 00:04:50,233
[TOI] I did live here,
but I left for a while

73
00:04:50,317 --> 00:04:52,108
after my mom and dad died.

74
00:04:52,192 --> 00:04:54,692
My relatives are running
the shop now.

75
00:04:54,775 --> 00:04:56,400
They just let me stay.

76
00:04:56,483 --> 00:04:58,983
[ENTA]
I see. Sorry.

77
00:04:59,067 --> 00:05:01,442
[TOI] Whatever.
Just tell me why you're here.

78
00:05:01,525 --> 00:05:03,483
Right. Almost forgot.

79
00:05:03,567 --> 00:05:06,400
I'm begging. Please let Kazuki
have your Dish of Hope!

80
00:05:06,483 --> 00:05:08,650
Give it up!
How long are you gonna

81
00:05:08,733 --> 00:05:11,025
let that guy keep
jerking you around like this?

82
00:05:11,108 --> 00:05:12,900
Time for you to move on.

83
00:05:12,983 --> 00:05:15,192
I owe my life to Kazuki,

84
00:05:15,275 --> 00:05:17,733
and if he's suffering,
I have to help him.

85
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:19,525
I won't lose him.

86
00:05:20,692 --> 00:05:23,567
[TOI] There's something
my brother said once.

87
00:05:27,442 --> 00:05:30,733
[TOI] Not everyone in this world
can find a way to survive.

88
00:05:30,817 --> 00:05:33,108
They die,
and then they're forgotten.

Not just people,
but buildings and cities, too.

That's just life.

91
00:05:38,567 --> 00:05:42,108
And when something's lost, it's
replaced with something new.

92
00:05:42,192 --> 00:05:43,733
Nobody gives a crap.

93
00:05:43,817 --> 00:05:46,275
They just move on
to the next thing.

94

[TOI] He doesn't want
to lose him, huh?

Not if I take
her place, they won't.

And when we meet,

113
00:06:31,733 --> 00:06:34,483
I told Haruka that I'd say
a secret password.

another way, then tell me!

Suddenly, I was reminded of
when I learned that lesson.

120
00:06:57,817 --> 00:07:01,108
[TOI] When I was ten,
my parents died.

From what I heard later,

122
00:07:02,567 --> 00:07:04,942
someone they thought was
a friend had conned them.

123
00:07:05,025 --> 00:07:06,775
And they were left
with a huge debt.

wear it in the afterlife,

it's doing us some good.

00:17:00,733 --> 00:17:02,067
so shoot him on sight.

313
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:03,858
What should I do?

314
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:07,817
Huh?

315
00:17:16,317 --> 00:17:19,692
Chikai. Uh.

316
00:17:26,483 --> 00:17:28,317
[TOI]
I know where this is going.

317
00:17:34,192 --> 00:17:35,817
[TOI panting]

318
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:37,317
[TAKU]
The kid got away!

319
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,150
[KOU] Stop complaining
and start looking!

320
00:17:39,233 --> 00:17:40,983
We gotta use him
as a hostage!

321
00:17:41,067 --> 00:17:42,858
[YASU squawks]

322
00:17:46,483 --> 00:17:48,358
[KAMOME]
Hey, pal.

323
00:17:48,442 --> 00:17:51,358
[chuckles]

324
00:17:51,442 --> 00:17:53,483
You aren't lost, are ya?

325
00:17:53,567 --> 00:17:55,942
Don't worry.
You stick with me.

326
00:17:57,442 --> 00:17:59,025
Kuji, no!

327
00:18:00,442 --> 00:18:02,400
[grunts]

328

--[loud dripping]

[gasps]

334
00:18:41,983 --> 00:18:45,608
Bad guys are the ones
who survive in this world.

335
00:18:48,108 --> 00:18:51,108
I'm the one
who just killed him, okay?

336
00:18:51,192 --> 00:18:52,400
With this gun.

337
00:18:52,483 --> 00:18:54,733
[gasps]

338
00:18:54,817 --> 00:18:57,150
[CHIKAI]
We're gonna make it. All right?

339
00:18:57,233 --> 00:18:59,983
You and me.
We're not gonna fade away.

340
00:19:00,067 --> 00:19:03,525
--No matter what it takes.
--[TOI sobbing]

341
00:19:06,608 --> 00:19:09,067
No!

[gulps]

343
00:19:16,275 --> 00:19:18,733
[KEPPI]
Desire, assimilated.

344
00:19:18,817 --> 00:19:20,983
[SOBATANI]
Now I'm double-dead.

345
00:19:28,775 --> 00:19:33,192
[REO sighs] Can't say I care for
losing so many times in a row.

346
00:19:33,275 --> 00:19:35,192
Maybe it's time
we get out there

347
00:19:35,275 --> 00:19:37,442
and take care
of this ourselves.

348
00:19:37,525 --> 00:19:40,108
[MABU] It's inefficient for us
to be involved personally.

349
00:19:40,192 --> 00:19:43,358
We'll simply raise the desire
level of our next target.

350
00:19:43,442 --> 00:19:46,442
You can't play it safe
all the time, Mabu.

351
00:19:46,525 --> 00:19:49,358
Nor can you be reckless
all the time, Reo.

352
00:19:56,775 --> 00:20:01,025
[KEPPI] What a pity.
Seems you've got another silver.

353
00:20:01,108 --> 00:20:02,942
[ENTA]
H-Hang on a sec.

354
00:20:03,025 --> 00:20:04,483
I saw what happened.

355
00:20:04,567 --> 00:20:06,192
That guy. You murdered him.

356
00:20:06,275 --> 00:20:08,817
That's right.
I'm a stone-cold killer.

357
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:10,025
[ENTA gasps]

358
00:20:10,108 --> 00:20:11,233
How can you say that
with a straight face?

359
00:20:11,317 --> 00:20:12,692
You're not even ashamed?

360
00:20:12,775 --> 00:20:13,817
If I hadn't shot first,

361
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:15,567
then he'd probably
have killed me,

362
00:20:15,650 --> 00:20:17,775
and my brother, too,
while he was at it.

363
00:20:17,858 --> 00:20:19,650
Maybe, but you can't just--

364
00:20:19,733 --> 00:20:21,900
[TOI] Have you ever
fought for your life?

365
00:20:21,983 --> 00:20:23,733
--[ENTA] Uh...
--[TOI] You only have morals

366
00:20:23,817 --> 00:20:25,858
because they haven't
been tested.

367
00:20:25,942 --> 00:20:27,442
My brother
sacrificed everything,

368
00:20:27,525 --> 00:20:29,275
and I'd do the same for him.

369
00:20:29,358 --> 00:20:32,233
'Cause we refuse to be
erased from this world.

370
00:20:32,317 --> 00:20:34,942
So, until you know
what that feels like,

371
00:20:35,025 --> 00:20:38,025
get off your damned high horse
and keep your mouth shut.

372
00:20:38,108 --> 00:20:39,483
If you spill our secret,

373
00:20:39,567 --> 00:20:40,817
it's over.

374
00:20:44,608 --> 00:20:46,442
[TOI]
I'll gut your ass.

375
00:22:23,733 --> 00:22:25,858
[KAZUKI]
Kuji.

376
00:22:25,942 --> 00:22:27,608
Hey, Kazuki!

377
00:22:30,067 --> 00:22:33,608
Here. Take the dish.
You deserve it.

378
00:22:33,692 --> 00:22:35,650
What? But why?

379
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:38,233
So what's the catch?

380
00:22:38,317 --> 00:22:40,108
[KAZUKI]
I just don't think

381
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:42,025
someone like me
has any right to take it.

382
00:22:42,108 --> 00:22:43,400
What are you saying?

383
00:22:43,483 --> 00:22:46,108
You're fighting for Haruka.
He's the bad one here!

384
00:22:46,192 --> 00:22:48,483
You're not giving up
already, are you?

385
00:22:48,567 --> 00:22:50,150
Don't you care what
happens to Haruka?

386
00:22:50,233 --> 00:22:51,233
Listen!

387
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:57,108
The truth is,
I hate Haruka.
