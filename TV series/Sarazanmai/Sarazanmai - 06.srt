Any word from Kazuki?

00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:17,775
[KAZUKI'S MOM]
He texted me last night

5
00:00:17,858 --> 00:00:21,442
and said he was staying over
at Enta's, but that's it.

[KAZUKI'S DAD]
I never noticed before,

7
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,400
but I suppose
they are a bit alike.

8
00:00:25,483 --> 00:00:28,108
[KAZUKI'S MOM] That might be
the only explanation we get.

[HARUKA]
Kazu! Wait!

12
00:00:42,858 --> 00:00:45,733
You should give
this back to him.

Next on our plate,

yesterday's flying

They're following up

00:17:01,317 --> 00:17:04,942
She looked
just like my brother.

318
00:17:05,025 --> 00:17:07,442
He never said anything,
but after that,

319
00:17:07,525 --> 00:17:10,692
Kazu stopped smiling
and threw out his <i>miçanga</i> .

320
00:17:10,775 --> 00:17:13,817
I knew it was my fault,
but I didn't want to lose him.

321
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:16,900
No matter what.
I wanted to see him smile again.

322
00:17:16,983 --> 00:17:18,942
He's done so much for me.

323
00:17:19,025 --> 00:17:21,233
I'm so happy
that he's my brother!

324
00:17:21,317 --> 00:17:24,983
So no matter what,
I'm never gonna give up on him.

325
00:17:25,067 --> 00:17:27,108
I know he'll come back someday,

326
00:17:27,192 --> 00:17:30,108
and I know he'll smile
again someday, too!

We can't do anything
from down here! Got a plan?

329
00:17:41,942 --> 00:17:45,233
Damn it!
We made it so far, too!

Please.
No.

335
00:18:00,567 --> 00:18:02,858
Come on, there's gotta
be something, right?

336
00:18:02,942 --> 00:18:04,900
Yeah, like what?

337
00:18:05,983 --> 00:18:08,108
[KEPPI] I know this will be
difficult for you,

Kick it to Yasaka!

00:18:20,525 --> 00:18:22,483
He can stop
the crane if he hits it!

345
00:18:22,567 --> 00:18:24,650

Wait! He won't play anymore!

Enta!

Gimme a pass!

348
00:18:29,692 --> 00:18:31,525
[HARUKA] He can be
a little stubborn sometimes,

349
00:18:31,608 --> 00:18:33,692
but once he sets
his eyes on the goal,

350
00:18:33,775 --> 00:18:35,025
Kazu never gives up.

351

--Here it comes! You got this!
--[KEPPI yelling]

Thanks, Enta!

353

[HARUKA]
And even when he's grumpy

354
00:18:41,942 --> 00:18:44,858
or he keeps to himself
a whole bunch, I don't mind.

355
00:18:44,942 --> 00:18:47,858
Because I know he's
a nice person under all that.

356
00:18:47,942 --> 00:18:51,150
Haruka!
I'm always here for you, 'kay?

I won't give up!

[HARUKA] You act like
you're all alone sometimes,

00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:19,192
but I'm not the only one who
wants to see you smile again.

Remember, Kazu,

you're in the middle

They stole our target yet again.

00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:55,900
They've discovered
our hidden base as well.

375

This error could
very well jeopardize

You're laughing. What is it?

Maybe he's not useless.

I owe him one.
