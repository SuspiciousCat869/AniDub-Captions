So, take your lucky selfie.

31

Then send it to
your special someone

with a certain
someone every day.

38

[KAZUKI] And our relationship
has to remain a secret.

00:19:31,192 --> 00:19:33,900
[ENTA] So, that stuff in
your box, Kazuki...

316
00:19:33,983 --> 00:19:35,317
[KAZUKI]
That's right.

317
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:39,983
I dress as Sara Azuma
and take selfies. I'm messed up.

318
00:19:40,067 --> 00:19:42,942
[ENTA] Uh, well, I mean,
I'm surprised, but whatever!

319
00:19:43,025 --> 00:19:45,025
We've been friends a long time,
so don't worry.

320
00:19:45,108 --> 00:19:47,150
Nothing's ever gonna
change that!

321
00:19:47,233 --> 00:19:50,900
Wow, seriously? Who knows
what else he's hiding.

322
00:19:50,983 --> 00:19:52,108
You really trust him?

323
00:19:52,192 --> 00:19:54,067
We have a bond,
and it's not gonna break

324
00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:55,817
over something petty like this!

325
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:58,900
And you're one to talk,
you thief! Breaking into cars!

326
00:19:58,983 --> 00:20:01,233
I'm not about to get
lectured by trash like you.

327
00:20:01,317 --> 00:20:03,025
What did you call me?

328
00:20:03,108 --> 00:20:04,692
--Shut up!
--[KEPPI groaning]

329
00:20:04,775 --> 00:20:06,525
[KAZUKI]
Stop talking out of your ass!

330
00:20:06,608 --> 00:20:08,483
It's none of your business,
got it?

331
00:20:08,567 --> 00:20:11,942
You don't need to understand!
So don't even bother!

332
00:20:12,025 --> 00:20:16,025
This is between me,
and Harukappa only, okay?

333
00:20:16,108 --> 00:20:17,817
And I will do anything.

334
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:21,525
I'll pretend to
be anything, for him!

335
00:20:22,942 --> 00:20:25,942
Bye, Sara. Nighty-night.

336
00:22:04,733 --> 00:22:05,983
[meowing]

337
00:22:06,067 --> 00:22:09,483
[NEKOYAMA] Let meowt!
I'm innocent, I tell mew!

338
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:13,442
[NEKOYAMA]
Meow.

339
00:22:13,525 --> 00:22:15,733
[MABU] For those lost souls
with no beginning,

340
00:22:15,817 --> 00:22:17,692
no end, and no connections...

341
00:22:17,775 --> 00:22:19,233
[meowing]

342
00:22:19,317 --> 00:22:22,483
...we shall open a
brand new door for you.

343
00:22:30,567 --> 00:22:32,733
[REO]
Is it desire?

344
00:22:32,817 --> 00:22:34,858
[MABU]
Or is it love?

345
00:22:42,608 --> 00:22:46,900
[BOTH]
Desire extraction!
