1
00:00:46,166 --> 00:00:47,458
[gasping, screaming]

2
00:00:49,041 --> 00:00:51,333
[MIKIMOTO] Port side territory.
Reduced by twenty percent!

3
00:00:51,416 --> 00:00:54,083
Damage to the
fleet is minimal. Sir!

4
00:00:56,458 --> 00:00:58,625
It appears we're
under attack, doesn't it?

5
00:00:58,708 --> 00:01:00,125
Everyone stand at the ready.

6
00:01:00,208 --> 00:01:02,250
I must say this
is quite unusual.

7
00:01:02,333 --> 00:01:04,250
It shouldn't be possible
for another Realizer

8
00:01:04,333 --> 00:01:05,625
to use Invisible.

9
00:01:05,708 --> 00:01:06,875
I'm picking up heat waves.

10
00:01:06,958 --> 00:01:08,375
Get ready for a second attack!

11
00:01:08,458 --> 00:01:09,750
All right, let's stay focused.

12
00:01:09,833 --> 00:01:11,500
Lose Invisible and Avoid.

13
00:01:11,583 --> 00:01:14,625
Also, divert all power
away from the Basic Realizers.

14
00:01:14,708 --> 00:01:16,000
Instead, let's use
everything we've got

15
00:01:16,083 --> 00:01:17,750
to deploy Protect Territory!

16
00:01:17,833 --> 00:01:19,541
Right! Yes sir!

17
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,833
Delightful.

18
00:01:25,916 --> 00:01:27,250
I didn't expect us
to be attacked

19
00:01:27,333 --> 00:01:29,083
from the front like this!

20
00:01:29,166 --> 00:01:30,958
Ah! How cocky of them!

21
00:01:31,041 --> 00:01:33,375
Their arrogance
is getting me hot.

22
00:01:33,458 --> 00:01:35,250
Oooh, it's making me crazy!

23
00:01:35,333 --> 00:01:38,333
Oh yeah, that's what
I'm talkin' about, baby!

24
00:01:41,083 --> 00:01:42,708
At this rate,
they'll bring us down!

25
00:01:43,833 --> 00:01:45,125
Hey! Shiizaki!

26
00:01:45,208 --> 00:01:47,375
Everything okay over there?

27
00:01:47,458 --> 00:01:48,750
Oh wait... Right.

28
00:01:48,833 --> 00:01:51,291
Let me guess, Kannazuki
is pissing everyone off?

29
00:01:51,375 --> 00:01:53,583
Well, sort of.
But that's not the problem.

30
00:01:53,666 --> 00:01:56,791
We're under attack.
We need you to take over!

31
00:01:56,875 --> 00:01:58,291
Please help us!

32
00:01:59,916 --> 00:02:02,250
Is that really all
you're worried about?

33
00:02:02,333 --> 00:02:04,041
Relax, it'll be fine!

34
00:02:04,125 --> 00:02:05,958
Kannazuki knows what he's doing.

35
00:02:06,041 --> 00:02:08,208
I'm sure he's
got it under control.

36
00:02:11,458 --> 00:02:12,833
[YOSHINO]
Oh, no... It's off.

37
00:02:12,916 --> 00:02:14,041
[YOSHINON] Aww, come on!

38
00:02:14,125 --> 00:02:15,166
Things were just getting good

39
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:16,291
and then you have
to go and turn off,

40
00:02:16,375 --> 00:02:17,875
you stupid TV!

41
00:02:30,208 --> 00:02:32,416
I swear you've
always been a martyr!

42
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:35,500
Taking everything on yourself
and refusing to ask for help!

43
00:02:35,583 --> 00:02:37,500
Refutation. I reject that!

44
00:02:37,583 --> 00:02:40,000
And I throw those words right
back in your direction.

45
00:02:40,083 --> 00:02:41,708
Because you're no different!

46
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,791
This isn't how
it's supposed to be!

47
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:48,333
Stop this!

48
00:02:48,416 --> 00:02:50,166
I know you love each other,
so why don't you act like it?

49
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:53,375
Shido. Be careful.
We're not alone!

50
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,333
[SHIDO] What are they?

51
00:02:58,416 --> 00:03:01,666
[ELLEN] Model number
"D-D-zero-zero-seven."

52
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:03,166
Bandersnatch.

53
00:03:04,166 --> 00:03:05,416
[SHIDO] Ellen?

54
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:08,125
Activate Protect Territory
at one o'clock, please.

55
00:03:08,208 --> 00:03:11,250
Range coordinates:
"X", one hundred and thirty two.

56
00:03:11,333 --> 00:03:13,458
"Y", fifty. "Z", thirty nine.

57
00:03:13,541 --> 00:03:15,208
Range, two hundred
and fifty five.

58
00:03:15,291 --> 00:03:17,000
Two hundred and forty six.

59
00:03:19,375 --> 00:03:20,625
[ELLEN]
We've been patiently waiting

60
00:03:20,708 --> 00:03:22,916
for the perfect opportunity
to catch you alone.

61
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,208
Hello, Princess.

62
00:03:24,291 --> 00:03:26,208
Though I have to admit,
I'm surprised.

63
00:03:26,291 --> 00:03:28,541
Those things--I didn't
realize they were Spirits,

64
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:31,208
much less a single
being split in two parts.

65
00:03:31,291 --> 00:03:32,708
Cut the crap and get to it.

66
00:03:32,791 --> 00:03:34,541
You're with AST, aren't you?

67
00:03:34,625 --> 00:03:35,708
So then you know all about

68
00:03:35,791 --> 00:03:38,250
the defense force's
anti-spirit team.

69
00:03:38,333 --> 00:03:41,750
Impressive.
Unfortunately, that's incorrect.

70
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:50,166
[TOHKA] Shido! You all right?

71
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:51,416
[SHIDO] Yeah.

72
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,291
[ELLEN] Well, it appears
you're the "real deal".

73
00:03:53,375 --> 00:03:54,916
Nicely done.

74
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,458
Princess...

75
00:03:56,541 --> 00:03:59,250
Why don't you do us all a favor
and come with me right now?

76
00:03:59,333 --> 00:04:01,750
If you oblige me, I promise
I'll make it worth your while.

77
00:04:01,833 --> 00:04:02,916
Shut your mouth!

78
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,125
Calm down!

79
00:04:04,208 --> 00:04:05,375
No matter what she's up to,
it's a bad idea

80
00:04:05,458 --> 00:04:06,625
to point that at anyone!

81
00:04:06,708 --> 00:04:07,833
Hold on a bit.

82
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,458
[TOHKA] I don't know
what it is exactly,

83
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:11,875
but something's wrong.

84
00:04:11,958 --> 00:04:15,750
This woman... I have
a bad feeling about her.

85
00:04:15,833 --> 00:04:19,333
It's like... she's an
over-powered version of an AST.

86
00:04:21,333 --> 00:04:23,416
[ELLEN] That's an
interesting way to put it.

87
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:28,000
Bandersnatch Squad.
Keep your distance for now.

88
00:04:28,083 --> 00:04:31,375
I'm gonna find out how good
this little Princess really is.

89
00:04:31,458 --> 00:04:33,416
It's put up or shut up time.

90
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:35,000
[TOHKA] Bring it on!

91
00:04:38,916 --> 00:04:40,833
[SHIIZAKI]
Sir. The ship is holding up.

92
00:04:40,916 --> 00:04:42,250
No damage yet.

93
00:04:42,333 --> 00:04:44,750
If Protect Territory is applied
to a pinpoint location,

94
00:04:44,833 --> 00:04:46,291
it's even more effective.

95
00:04:46,375 --> 00:04:49,000
Who knows, with this strategy
and a little bit of luck,

96
00:04:49,083 --> 00:04:51,083
we might survive
this attack after all.

97
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:52,291
Yes, possibly.

98
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:54,041
But what about the
rest of the ship, sir?

99
00:04:54,125 --> 00:04:55,958
We're completely
vulnerable everywhere else!

100
00:04:56,041 --> 00:04:57,041
Next up!

101
00:04:57,125 --> 00:04:59,208
Specifying range
in the same direction.

102
00:04:59,291 --> 00:05:01,250
Five zero. Six nine!

103
00:05:01,333 --> 00:05:02,916
[NAKATSUGAWA]
That range is far too narrow!

104
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,583
Hurry up or we're dead.

105
00:05:04,666 --> 00:05:06,166
And it'll be a painful death.

106
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:07,708
But you know...

107
00:05:07,791 --> 00:05:09,166
That doesn't sound all bad.

108
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:11,625
Plus, sometimes bad is good!

109
00:05:11,708 --> 00:05:14,291
[MINOWA]
Range. Five zero. Six nine.

110
00:05:14,375 --> 00:05:15,666
Deploy!

111
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:17,083
[KANNAZUKI] I've been
a naughty little space man.

112
00:05:17,166 --> 00:05:17,958
I think someone needs
to come and teach me a lesson

113
00:05:18,041 --> 00:05:19,291
--I'll never, ever forget!

114
00:05:19,375 --> 00:05:20,583
--Wow. It's incredible!
--I'll never, ever forget!

115
00:05:20,666 --> 00:05:21,958
We blocked it!

116
00:05:22,041 --> 00:05:24,083
This attack was even
stronger than the one before.

117
00:05:24,166 --> 00:05:26,416
So that's why he
made the range so little?

118
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,250
[KOTORI]
Relax, it'll be fine!

119
00:05:28,333 --> 00:05:30,375
Kannazuki knows what he's doing.

120
00:05:39,541 --> 00:05:41,125
[TOHKA yelling]

121
00:05:42,875 --> 00:05:45,375
Come on, is that really
all you've got, Princess?

122
00:05:45,458 --> 00:05:46,708
I was looking forward to this.

123
00:05:46,791 --> 00:05:48,916
I even equipped
Pendragon for you.

124
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,750
What a disappointment.

125
00:05:50,833 --> 00:05:52,291
Time to end this.

126
00:06:09,083 --> 00:06:10,166
[TOHKA screams]

127
00:06:11,291 --> 00:06:13,291
[SHIDO] Tohka! I'm coming!

128
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:16,208
[SHIDO] Stop this! Now!

129
00:06:16,291 --> 00:06:18,041
[ELLEN] I think not.

130
00:06:18,125 --> 00:06:19,833
First, make sure
our guest is unconscious

131
00:06:19,916 --> 00:06:21,958
and then take her
back to the Arbatel.

132
00:06:27,833 --> 00:06:29,333
Damn you! Let her go!

133
00:06:29,416 --> 00:06:31,000
What do you bastards
think you're doing?

134
00:06:31,083 --> 00:06:31,708
Tohka!

135
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:33,041
[TOHKA whimpering]

136
00:06:33,125 --> 00:06:34,916
Stop it!

137
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,916
[TOHKA whimpering]

138
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,458
[SHIDO] Oh no...
There's nothing I can do.

139
00:06:40,541 --> 00:06:42,916
This can't be happening,
not again.

140
00:06:46,375 --> 00:06:50,291
[SHIDO]
No! I refuse to feel helpless!

141
00:06:55,375 --> 00:06:57,916
[SHIDO] Tohka!

142
00:07:23,166 --> 00:07:24,750
[SHIIZAKI]
We're fine. No damage.

143
00:07:24,833 --> 00:07:26,625
[NAKATSUGAWA]
It was blocked again.

144
00:07:26,708 --> 00:07:27,958
[KANNAZUKI] If I wasn't
concerned for the ship,

145
00:07:28,041 --> 00:07:30,458
I'd welcome a few more attacks.

146
00:07:30,541 --> 00:07:31,875
It's the truth.

147
00:07:31,958 --> 00:07:36,833
They really get me hot...
and make me feel so dirty.

148
00:07:36,916 --> 00:07:39,416
Prepare the magic
power cannon, Mistilteinn.

149
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:40,750
Engage!

150
00:07:51,583 --> 00:07:53,083
[yelling]

151
00:07:54,666 --> 00:07:56,125
[PADDINGTON] Damn him!

152
00:07:56,208 --> 00:07:58,500
Damn that stupid bastard!

153
00:07:58,583 --> 00:08:00,041
Turn all Ashcroft betas,

154
00:08:00,125 --> 00:08:03,500
channels one through fifty,
up to maximum power immediately!

155
00:08:04,833 --> 00:08:08,125
[PADDINGTON] Let's end this.
Full speed ahead!

156
00:08:08,208 --> 00:08:10,791
Shave off the
enemy ship's Territory!

157
00:08:15,083 --> 00:08:16,458
How can this be?

158
00:08:16,541 --> 00:08:18,458
How are you holding Sandalphon?

159
00:08:18,541 --> 00:08:20,500
What are you, Shido Itsuka?

160
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:22,041
I thought you were a human.

161
00:08:22,125 --> 00:08:23,958
I am a human.

162
00:08:24,041 --> 00:08:25,916
Well, more or less.

163
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,208
I do believe
I've changed my mind.

164
00:08:28,291 --> 00:08:30,333
I'd like for you
to come with me as well.

165
00:08:30,416 --> 00:08:32,208
Resisting us would not be wise.

166
00:08:32,291 --> 00:08:33,333
It's Mistilteinn.

167
00:08:33,416 --> 00:08:34,833
The canon's been evaded!

168
00:08:34,916 --> 00:08:37,500
[KANNAZUKI] Oh well, I've
never been good at attacking.

169
00:08:38,625 --> 00:08:42,166
I'm better at taking pain.
I never thought about giving it.

170
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:46,000
Incoming.
The enemy is heading this way!

171
00:08:46,083 --> 00:08:47,291
Interesting.

172
00:08:47,375 --> 00:08:48,500
Those naughty
little boys have come

173
00:08:48,583 --> 00:08:51,291
to shave off
our Territory directly.

174
00:08:51,375 --> 00:08:54,708
Activate the Basic Realizers
with parallel driving force.

175
00:08:54,791 --> 00:08:57,416
Bring all generated
magic power to the Territory!

176
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:00,125
Roger. AR zero zero eight!

177
00:09:00,208 --> 00:09:01,958
Devices one through
ten initialize!

178
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:03,541
Drive force engage!

179
00:09:03,625 --> 00:09:06,583
[KANNAZUKI] Oh. I almost forgot
the most important thing.

180
00:09:06,666 --> 00:09:08,250
Leave one Control Realizer as-is

181
00:09:08,333 --> 00:09:10,458
and send the rest
to generate power, please.

182
00:09:10,541 --> 00:09:12,041
Copy that.

183
00:09:12,125 --> 00:09:14,416
But what will
control the magic power?

184
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:15,458
Don't worry.

185
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:19,625
I have a plan in mind.
Just wait and see.

186
00:09:20,833 --> 00:09:21,458
[MALE ARBATEL OPERATOR 2A]
Enemy ship.

187
00:09:21,541 --> 00:09:23,416
Territory output rising!

188
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,625
[PADDINGTON]
Ha! What kind of fool are you?

189
00:09:25,708 --> 00:09:27,708
Trying to ambush the Arbatel!

190
00:09:27,791 --> 00:09:30,000
[MALE ARBATEL OPERATOR 2B]
Territory coming into contact!

191
00:09:32,375 --> 00:09:34,125
[PADDINGTON]
Territory! Deploy range!

192
00:09:34,208 --> 00:09:36,541
Condense the entire attack
to the point of contact!

193
00:09:36,625 --> 00:09:38,333
We'll flatten them
with one blow!

194
00:09:38,416 --> 00:09:39,166
[MALE ARBATEL OPERATOR 2A]
Roger that!

195
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:41,125
Territory, deploy range now!

196
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:46,375
[PADDINGTON] Our Territory
output is even with theirs.

197
00:09:46,458 --> 00:09:48,291
But by contracting
the Arbatel's range,

198
00:09:48,375 --> 00:09:49,416
we grow stronger,

199
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,416
which gives us
a clear upper hand!

200
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:52,833
Yes! I've won!

201
00:09:52,916 --> 00:09:54,833
Victory is mine!

202
00:09:54,916 --> 00:09:56,125
[ELLEN] Bandersnatch squad.

203
00:09:56,208 --> 00:09:57,500
Take him into custody.

204
00:09:57,583 --> 00:09:59,791
If he resists, break his arms.

205
00:09:59,875 --> 00:10:03,000
If he still resists,
break his legs, too.

206
00:10:03,083 --> 00:10:05,250
Shido!

207
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:14,833
[PADDINGTON]
What happened?!

208
00:10:14,916 --> 00:10:15,875
[MALE ARBATEL OPERATOR 2B]
We've been hit.

209
00:10:15,958 --> 00:10:17,750
Impact on the
starboard side, sir!

210
00:10:17,833 --> 00:10:18,750
[PADDINGTON]
That's impossible!

211
00:10:18,833 --> 00:10:20,208
How can this be?

212
00:10:20,291 --> 00:10:21,500
[MALE ARBATEL OPERATOR 2A]
Captain!

213
00:10:21,583 --> 00:10:23,083
Severe damage was sustained
in the B2 sector.

214
00:10:23,166 --> 00:10:24,875
The control room is on fire!

215
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:27,750
Then put it out, imbecile!

216
00:10:32,791 --> 00:10:34,416
Whoa. What the hell?

217
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:35,541
The Bandersnatch Squad

218
00:10:35,625 --> 00:10:37,583
has gone completely
haywire down here.

219
00:10:37,666 --> 00:10:40,291
Does somebody wanna fill me in?

220
00:10:40,375 --> 00:10:42,125
Wait, the control
room's under attack?

221
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:44,125
No, that's not possible!

222
00:10:44,208 --> 00:10:46,125
Why are you engaged
with an airship?

223
00:10:46,208 --> 00:10:48,375
I don't remember
giving that order!

224
00:10:48,458 --> 00:10:50,833
[SHIDO]
Come on Tohka, let's go!

225
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:52,458
Quick, after them!

226
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:56,250
What in the hell
is going on?

227
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,083
[ELLEN screaming]

228
00:11:04,083 --> 00:11:06,875
[ELLEN] No... This can't be...
It's not fair.

229
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:10,541
I'm... I am the greatest
wizard in all the land.

230
00:11:10,625 --> 00:11:12,083
Crap.

231
00:11:12,166 --> 00:11:13,333
[AI] Hey guys...

232
00:11:13,416 --> 00:11:15,708
Remember when we like
dug all of those traps?

233
00:11:15,791 --> 00:11:16,875
I'm pretty sure
there's one out there

234
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:19,000
that no one
ever got caught in.

235
00:11:19,083 --> 00:11:21,750
Well who knows,
maybe we hid it too well?

236
00:11:21,833 --> 00:11:23,625
[yawning]

237
00:11:23,708 --> 00:11:25,416
That is so lame.

238
00:11:30,125 --> 00:11:32,458
[KAWAGOE] Look.
The enemy ship is retreating!

239
00:11:32,541 --> 00:11:34,958
[SHIIZAKI]
Hey. Hold on a sec.

240
00:11:35,041 --> 00:11:37,541
Do you see that?
What's going on?

241
00:11:41,916 --> 00:11:44,041
He just generated a Territory

242
00:11:44,125 --> 00:11:46,666
from the
Yggdrafolium Realizer?

243
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:49,416
[NAKATSUGAWA] We're attacking
the enemy ship like a mine?

244
00:11:50,625 --> 00:11:51,875
[KAWAGOE]
He may be unconventional

245
00:11:51,958 --> 00:11:53,500
and a whole lot
on the weird side,

246
00:11:53,583 --> 00:11:55,125
but he knows what he's doing.

247
00:12:01,708 --> 00:12:03,458
[SHIDO] Kaguya! Yuzuru!

248
00:12:03,541 --> 00:12:05,000
Stop it right now!

249
00:12:05,083 --> 00:12:06,750
Listen to me!
Please don't do this.

250
00:12:06,833 --> 00:12:09,166
There might be a way
for both of you to live!

251
00:12:11,416 --> 00:12:14,083
[SHIDO] I know.
This'll get their attention!

252
00:12:16,291 --> 00:12:17,458
[SHIDO] Hey!

253
00:12:19,333 --> 00:12:21,208
No luck! Damn!

254
00:12:21,291 --> 00:12:24,166
Come on. Just look!

255
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:26,083
Over here!

256
00:12:26,166 --> 00:12:28,333
Kaguya! Yuzuru!

257
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:31,666
Hearing the
passion in your voice...

258
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:34,541
I'd be lying to you if
I said I wasn't a bit jealous.

259
00:12:34,625 --> 00:12:36,500
What should I do?

260
00:12:36,583 --> 00:12:38,125
How do I stop them?

261
00:12:38,208 --> 00:12:39,750
You summoned Sandalphon.

262
00:12:39,833 --> 00:12:42,625
You brought forth its power
with your desire, Shido.

263
00:12:42,708 --> 00:12:44,041
You see, it answered your call

264
00:12:44,125 --> 00:12:47,041
and only you have the power
to command it now.

265
00:12:47,125 --> 00:12:51,041
[SHIDO] Only me? But how?

266
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:53,958
[SHIDO] Help me.

267
00:12:54,041 --> 00:12:55,791
Calm your heart
and still your mind.

268
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:57,625
What do you want at this moment?

269
00:12:57,708 --> 00:13:00,333
Focus on your desire
and let everything else go.

270
00:13:00,416 --> 00:13:03,333
Let your wish come to the
forefront of all your senses.

271
00:13:03,416 --> 00:13:05,708
Nothing else in the world
matters right now...

272
00:13:05,791 --> 00:13:06,958
Just this.

273
00:13:07,041 --> 00:13:08,625
Picture what you want.

274
00:13:08,708 --> 00:13:10,208
Yearn for it in
the depths of your heart

275
00:13:10,291 --> 00:13:12,625
and swing with
everything you have.

276
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:13,875
Please trust me.

277
00:13:13,958 --> 00:13:16,375
Do this, and the Angel
will be by your side.

278
00:13:23,125 --> 00:13:27,583
[yelling]

279
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:38,583
Such unease. Turmoil.

280
00:13:39,625 --> 00:13:40,833
Listen to me.

281
00:13:40,916 --> 00:13:43,958
Stop it. Right now.
This fighting has to end!

282
00:13:44,041 --> 00:13:46,000
You just don't get it,
do you, Shido?

283
00:13:46,083 --> 00:13:48,416
This doesn't have anything
to do with you anymore!

284
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:51,291
Agreement. Please do not
come between us, Shido.

285
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,000
No, you're wrong!

286
00:13:55,083 --> 00:13:58,125
I get to pick the winner of this
duel. That hasn't changed a bit!

287
00:13:58,208 --> 00:13:59,666
Did you hear what I said?

288
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:02,541
The true Yamai
will be decided by me!

289
00:14:09,416 --> 00:14:10,916
[SHIDO]
I've made my decision...

290
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,833
And I choose both of you!

291
00:14:15,708 --> 00:14:17,291
[KAGUYA]
You can't be serious!

292
00:14:17,375 --> 00:14:18,708
What, are you stupid?

293
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:22,708
[YUZURU] Scorn.
That answer is entirely absurd!

294
00:14:22,791 --> 00:14:24,875
[SHIDO] Maybe so,
but that's my answer.

295
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:26,416
You both have your strengths,

296
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,625
but neither of you are more
deserving than the other,

297
00:14:28,708 --> 00:14:30,500
so it's impossible to pick!

298
00:14:30,583 --> 00:14:31,958
Kaguya!

299
00:14:32,041 --> 00:14:35,875
You care about Yuzuru more
than she cares for herself.

300
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:37,125
And Yuzuru.

301
00:14:37,208 --> 00:14:40,875
The same is true of how
you feel about Kaguya.

302
00:14:40,958 --> 00:14:42,333
If you won't
accept my decision,

303
00:14:42,416 --> 00:14:43,833
then figure it out yourselves.

304
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:45,625
Here are your options:

305
00:14:45,708 --> 00:14:49,833
One. Yuzuru takes in Kaguya
and becomes the true Yamai!

306
00:14:49,916 --> 00:14:54,625
Two. Kaguya takes in Yuzuru and
becomes the true Yamai!

307
00:14:54,708 --> 00:14:55,666
That's easy!

308
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:57,000
Three!

309
00:14:57,083 --> 00:14:59,541
In exchange for losing
all of your Spirit powers,

310
00:14:59,625 --> 00:15:01,791
you both get to live!

311
00:15:01,875 --> 00:15:03,000
Sorry.

312
00:15:03,083 --> 00:15:04,375
But I always prefer
to have a third option

313
00:15:04,458 --> 00:15:06,041
in situations like these.

314
00:15:06,125 --> 00:15:08,291
"Either/or"
really isn't my style!

315
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:10,958
Now it's time for you to choose!

316
00:15:11,041 --> 00:15:12,541
[KAGUYA]
What are you saying?

317
00:15:12,625 --> 00:15:14,541
[YUZURU]
Doubt. It won't work.

318
00:15:14,625 --> 00:15:15,916
[SHIDO] Yes, it will.

319
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,166
Trust me, okay? I promise.

320
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:20,666
Look.

321
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:21,916
The only thing I'm asking
is that you give me the chance

322
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,375
to help you survive.

323
00:15:24,458 --> 00:15:26,125
You're just a human.

324
00:15:26,208 --> 00:15:28,125
And humans don't have
the power to do that!

325
00:15:28,208 --> 00:15:29,708
[SHIDO] Maybe I do!

326
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:33,041
Remember, I'm the one who split
that wind you're so proud of!

327
00:15:35,541 --> 00:15:37,333
[SHIDO] If I fail...

328
00:15:37,416 --> 00:15:40,541
You can kill me,
for all I care!

329
00:15:40,625 --> 00:15:41,583
Please!

330
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,041
No!

331
00:15:50,458 --> 00:15:52,208
Well, any thoughts? Speak up.

332
00:15:52,291 --> 00:15:53,666
[YUZURU] Disbelief.

333
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:56,416
For a human being to have
that ability seems unlikely.

334
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:57,625
I know, right?

335
00:15:57,708 --> 00:15:59,500
But the little twerp
won't leave us be.

336
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:02,208
He's interrupted our
duels twice, the annoying brat.

337
00:16:02,291 --> 00:16:03,541
Concur.

338
00:16:03,625 --> 00:16:04,916
I was rapidly nearing
the point of defeating you

339
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,583
once and for all and letting
you survive in my place.

340
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:08,625
[KAGUYA]
Not to burst your bubble,

341
00:16:08,708 --> 00:16:10,458
but that wasn't gonna happen.

342
00:16:10,541 --> 00:16:12,833
I was gonna win
and let you survive.

343
00:16:20,666 --> 00:16:22,500
[KAGUYA] Hey, Yuzuru.

344
00:16:22,583 --> 00:16:24,583
[YUZURU] Reply. What is it?

345
00:16:24,666 --> 00:16:25,625
[KAGUYA] Well...

346
00:16:25,708 --> 00:16:27,625
This is all purely hypothetical,

347
00:16:27,708 --> 00:16:29,916
but what if
Shido's actually right?

348
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,583
And we can both live?

349
00:16:31,666 --> 00:16:34,083
[YUZURU]
Response. I would like it.

350
00:16:34,166 --> 00:16:35,666
That would make me happy.

351
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:38,916
[KAGUYA] Geez.
You're unexpectedly romantic.

352
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,791
[YUZURU] Protest.
No more so than you are.

353
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:44,416
[KAGUYA] Yeah,
I suppose you're right. I am.

354
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:45,500
[YUZURU] Question.

355
00:16:45,583 --> 00:16:47,750
If we could both
survive like he said,

356
00:16:47,833 --> 00:16:50,083
what would be the
first thing you would do?

357
00:16:50,166 --> 00:16:52,208
[KAGUYA] Huh... Good question.

358
00:16:52,291 --> 00:16:54,666
Oh! I think I'd wanna try
that kinako bread

359
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:56,041
Tohka told us about!

360
00:16:56,125 --> 00:16:58,333
Apparently,
it's pretty delicious!

361
00:16:58,416 --> 00:17:01,458
[YUZURU] Agreement.
I would enjoy that as well.

362
00:17:01,541 --> 00:17:03,041
What about you, Yuzuru?

363
00:17:03,125 --> 00:17:06,041
[YUZURU] Answer. I would
like to try going to school.

364
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:07,291
That sounds awesome!

365
00:17:07,375 --> 00:17:09,333
The boys would be
all over you from day one.

366
00:17:09,416 --> 00:17:11,291
They wouldn't know
what to do with themselves!

367
00:17:11,375 --> 00:17:14,000
Negative.
I believe you are exaggerating.

368
00:17:14,083 --> 00:17:16,333
If anything,
the boys would come after you.

369
00:17:16,416 --> 00:17:17,958
[KAGUYA]
Do you really think so?

370
00:17:18,041 --> 00:17:21,375
Correct. Of course,
this is all just hypothetical.

371
00:17:21,458 --> 00:17:23,250
[KAGUYA] Yeah. That's true.

372
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:24,583
But, hypothetically,

373
00:17:24,666 --> 00:17:27,541
we could stroll around town
after school, right?

374
00:17:27,625 --> 00:17:30,750
[YUZURU] Agreement. I would
also like to go to a café.

375
00:17:30,833 --> 00:17:31,958
[KAGUYA] Sounds good, but...

376
00:17:32,041 --> 00:17:33,916
We're definitely
splitting the check.

377
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
[YUZURU]
Negative. You are buying.

378
00:17:36,083 --> 00:17:38,333
After all, you eat
more than I do.

379
00:17:38,416 --> 00:17:40,291
[KAGUYA] Come on,
I don't eat that much food!

380
00:17:40,375 --> 00:17:42,291
[YUZURU]
Error. Yes, you do.

381
00:17:46,875 --> 00:17:48,250
[KAGUYA] Yuzuru?

382
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:50,416
[YUZURU]
Reply. What is it?

383
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:51,750
I'm sorry.

384
00:17:51,833 --> 00:17:56,500
Will you forgive me
for lying to you? I...

385
00:17:56,583 --> 00:17:59,333
I know I said I did,
but I don't want to die.

386
00:17:59,416 --> 00:18:02,208
I just want to live. With you.

387
00:18:02,291 --> 00:18:05,208
I want us to be together
a little longer.

388
00:18:05,291 --> 00:18:08,000
[YUZURU] Reply. I concur.

389
00:18:08,083 --> 00:18:10,500
I don't want to disappear.

390
00:18:10,583 --> 00:18:12,958
I want to be
by your side, Kaguya.

391
00:18:13,041 --> 00:18:14,833
Yuzuru!

392
00:18:14,916 --> 00:18:16,500
Kaguya!

393
00:18:22,291 --> 00:18:23,541
[ARBATEL OPERATOR 2B]
Captain!

394
00:18:23,625 --> 00:18:25,541
We can't lower our altitude
any more than this!

395
00:18:25,625 --> 00:18:27,375
The residents will notice us!

396
00:18:27,458 --> 00:18:28,958
[PADDINGTON]
Do as you're told!

397
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:31,500
I'm not leaving this fight with
my tail tucked between my legs

398
00:18:31,583 --> 00:18:32,875
like some coward!

399
00:18:32,958 --> 00:18:35,708
Deploy all Bandersnatch
left in the ship right away!

400
00:18:35,791 --> 00:18:37,750
I'll capture them
myself if I have to!

401
00:18:37,833 --> 00:18:40,458
I will not leave here
empty handed!

402
00:18:42,833 --> 00:18:44,500
This is just
getting ridiculous.

403
00:18:44,583 --> 00:18:47,416
[YUZURU] Agreement. I do
wish they could take a hint.

404
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:50,041
I've got an idea. Wanna play?

405
00:18:50,125 --> 00:18:52,750
Affirmative.
Let's put an end to this.

406
00:19:11,333 --> 00:19:13,750
--Raphael... El Kanaf!
--Raphael... El Kanaf!

407
00:19:33,166 --> 00:19:34,166
[YOSHINO] No!

408
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:45,000
Well... I'm glad
to see you're awake.

409
00:19:45,083 --> 00:19:46,625
Yeah, me too.

410
00:19:46,708 --> 00:19:48,583
But wait... What happened?

411
00:19:48,666 --> 00:19:50,791
When that machine
attacked us, you intervened.

412
00:19:50,875 --> 00:19:51,875
It knocked you unconscious,

413
00:19:51,958 --> 00:19:54,291
but thankfully,
stopped moving after.

414
00:19:54,375 --> 00:19:56,541
I owe you far more
than I can ever repay.

415
00:19:56,625 --> 00:19:58,125
You saved my life.

416
00:19:58,208 --> 00:19:59,375
What about Shido?

417
00:19:59,458 --> 00:20:00,833
He's in danger.

418
00:20:02,708 --> 00:20:04,291
Don't push yourself too hard.

419
00:20:04,375 --> 00:20:06,833
He'll be back soon.
I have no doubt.

420
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,958
I want to be strong.
And powerful.

421
00:20:11,041 --> 00:20:14,166
Not for myself,
but so I can protect him.

422
00:20:14,833 --> 00:20:16,041
[KAGUYA] Hey, Shido?

423
00:20:16,125 --> 00:20:18,125
We want to thank you
for everything.

424
00:20:18,208 --> 00:20:20,375
It means a lot. We won't forget.

425
00:20:20,458 --> 00:20:22,541
[YUZURU]
Indeed. Sincere thanks.

426
00:20:22,625 --> 00:20:25,125
We will both be
in your debt forever.

427
00:20:25,208 --> 00:20:26,500
[SHIDO]
Eh, it's no big deal.

428
00:20:26,583 --> 00:20:27,583
It is.

429
00:20:27,666 --> 00:20:29,500
And as a way of
properly thanking you,

430
00:20:29,583 --> 00:20:30,750
we'd like to give you a gift.

431
00:20:30,833 --> 00:20:33,291
Petition. Please close
your eyes, immediately.

432
00:20:33,375 --> 00:20:36,166
Huh? Oh. Right.

433
00:20:39,208 --> 00:20:40,291
Whoa! Hey!

434
00:20:40,375 --> 00:20:41,833
What the heck
do you think you're doing?

435
00:20:41,916 --> 00:20:43,166
Thanking you, Silly.

436
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:44,958
I already told you.

437
00:20:45,041 --> 00:20:47,041
What's wrong?
Did you not like it?

438
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:49,125
[KAGUYA screams]

439
00:20:49,208 --> 00:20:51,416
Dismay! How indecent!

440
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,625
Wait. Just calm down,
I didn't have a choice.

441
00:20:53,708 --> 00:20:55,291
I know it's weird,
but this is what happens

442
00:20:55,375 --> 00:20:56,500
when your powers are sealed!

443
00:20:56,583 --> 00:20:59,833
[TOHKA] Shido?
What was that bright light?

444
00:20:59,916 --> 00:21:01,041
--What in the world
--[SHIDO] No... Tohka!

445
00:21:01,125 --> 00:21:01,958
--is going on here?!
--[SHIDO] No... Tohka!

446
00:21:02,041 --> 00:21:04,166
This is not what it looks like!

447
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:06,958
We tried to thank Shido and then
he made our clothes disappear!

448
00:21:07,041 --> 00:21:09,666
Depression. Now I'll never
find a suitable husband.

449
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:11,666
[SHIDO] No, you've
got it all wrong, I swear!

450
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:13,708
Shido!

451
00:21:13,791 --> 00:21:16,791
[ELLEN] I have confirmation.
There's no mistake.

452
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:19,791
Tohka Yatogami
is the Spirit, Princess.

453
00:21:19,875 --> 00:21:21,208
[WESTCOTT] I see.

454
00:21:21,291 --> 00:21:23,708
At the very least we confirmed
what we needed to know,

455
00:21:23,791 --> 00:21:25,750
which makes
this mission a success.

456
00:21:25,833 --> 00:21:28,583
Good work. Return to base.

457
00:21:28,666 --> 00:21:29,916
[ELLEN] Right.

458
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,541
Do I have permission
to ask you a question, sir?

459
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:35,458
[WESTCOTT]
Be quick about it.

460
00:21:35,541 --> 00:21:37,375
Do you think it's possible
that there's a human being

461
00:21:37,458 --> 00:21:39,750
who can handle
the power of the Spirits?

462
00:21:39,833 --> 00:21:42,208
Or would you say that's
a ridiculous notion?

463
00:23:13,041 --> 00:23:16,041
[WOODMAN] I just received
a rather disturbing report.

464
00:23:16,125 --> 00:23:17,791
Much to my surprise,

465
00:23:17,875 --> 00:23:21,500
it seems your brother
manifested an angel.

466
00:23:21,583 --> 00:23:23,000
You're sure about this?

467
00:23:23,083 --> 00:23:23,875
Already?

468
00:23:23,958 --> 00:23:25,833
[WOODMAN] Yes, I'm afraid so.

469
00:23:25,916 --> 00:23:27,250
If worse comes to worse,

470
00:23:27,333 --> 00:23:30,041
we may be forced to
"deal with him". If not,

471
00:23:30,125 --> 00:23:32,458
calamity could again
befall the Spirits

472
00:23:32,541 --> 00:23:34,666
we worked so hard to seal.

473
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:37,250
And you know as well as I
that is not an option.

474
00:23:37,333 --> 00:23:39,250
[KOTORI] I see.

475
00:23:39,333 --> 00:23:40,250
[WOODMAN]
I'm sorry to force

476
00:23:40,333 --> 00:23:42,375
such an unpleasant
task on you...

477
00:23:42,458 --> 00:23:44,666
But I'm afraid
