You were just a girl,
a run of the mill human being,

00:09:23,208 --> 00:09:26,750
no different than me,
weren't you? Am I wrong?

163
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:30,166
It's true. But how
did you know that?

Let's just say an acquaintance

I guess you could say I was.

180

I was a normal little girl

more than anything.

[CROWD cheering]

[MIKU] My songs were
all I had growing up.

185
00:10:21,708 --> 00:10:23,750
And when I was able to make
a career out of singing

186
00:10:23,833 --> 00:10:26,291
and reach so many
people with my music,

187
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:29,333
I was as happy as I'd ever been.

188
00:10:29,416 --> 00:10:32,625
Everyone loved my songs,
which gave me great joy.

189
00:10:32,708 --> 00:10:36,833
I was thrilled to
share it with my fans!

190
00:10:36,916 --> 00:10:39,500
But one day, after my
first album dropped,

191
00:10:39,583 --> 00:10:41,583
my manager set me
up with a producer.

192
00:10:41,666 --> 00:10:43,625
He was from a TV station
so it seemed like

193
00:10:43,708 --> 00:10:49,208
a decent opportunity. My manager
told me to be "extra nice."

194
00:10:49,291 --> 00:10:52,208
Hold on, extra nice?
Does that mean--

195
00:10:52,291 --> 00:10:54,916
Yes. I'm afraid it means
what you think.

196
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,291
I refused him, of course.

197
00:10:57,375 --> 00:10:59,750
I didn't wanna be
a TV star anyway.

198
00:10:59,833 --> 00:11:01,750
I just wanted to make
music for myself

199
00:11:01,833 --> 00:11:04,250
and the people who loved it.

200
00:11:04,333 --> 00:11:07,125
But, then a scandal
about the producer and me

201
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:09,416
was published in
a weekly magazine.

202
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:14,958
No one, not even my agency,
was there to protect me.

203
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:16,583
You know what hurt me the most?

204
00:11:16,666 --> 00:11:18,791
My fans. No--

205
00:11:18,875 --> 00:11:21,625
The brutal reactions of the
people I thought were my fans

206
00:11:21,708 --> 00:11:23,541
was the worst.

207
00:11:23,625 --> 00:11:26,166
I tried to take
comfort in my music.

208
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:28,416
As long as they listened
to it, I thought

209

they would come around. But...

[MIKU]
The stress became too much

211

and I lost my voice forever.

212

I stood up for myself.

And thanks to those evil men,
my voice was gone.

[SHIDO] I think what happened
to you is a terrible thing.

216
00:11:59,958 --> 00:12:01,541
The fact that your
agents and your fans

217
00:12:01,625 --> 00:12:03,791
turned their backs on
you makes me angry.

introduce myself.

here alive, Diva.

Wait don't tell me.

You can't be. There's no way!

I'm a human and
my name's Shido!

352
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:47,208
I've come to save Tohka.

353

If you know what's good for you,
you'll get her out of there.

354
00:17:49,708 --> 00:17:53,958
So you're Shido Itsuka? Amazing.

355
00:17:54,041 --> 00:17:55,125
Never thought I'd meet someone

356
00:17:55,208 --> 00:17:57,583
who can handle the
power of the Spirits.

357
00:17:57,666 --> 00:18:02,000
I didn't think it was possible,
but apparently, I was wrong.

358

How incredibly funny this is.

359
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:06,375
And every single detail
is going precisely

360
00:18:06,458 --> 00:18:09,208
according to that woman's plan.

361
00:18:09,291 --> 00:18:12,500
So now do you see what
I was talking about? Ugh.

362
00:18:12,583 --> 00:18:14,875
This is exactly why
I don't like men.

363
00:18:14,958 --> 00:18:18,250
I don't like him either,
but it's not because he's a man.

364
00:18:18,333 --> 00:18:20,416
Let her out, Or else, Westcott.

365
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,541
And if I were to
say "no," I wonder:

366
00:18:22,625 --> 00:18:25,916
what would you do then? I should
probably be afraid, right?

367
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,208
If you don't let
her go willingly,

368
00:18:27,291 --> 00:18:29,041
I'll have to make you do it!

369
00:18:29,125 --> 00:18:30,791
And how would you
do that exactly?

370
00:18:30,875 --> 00:18:32,208
I'm very curious.

Don't worry, I won't fight.

as my counterpart, Ellen.

power of Spirits, can you not?

Why don't you cut it and
tear it open yourself?

him to do what I say.

I suppose.

Though, honestly, I really don't
like you telling me what to do.

Oh, right. I almost forgot.
