And now,

here are your results
for the 25th annual

[CROWD cheering]

10
00:01:28,833 --> 00:01:30,958
[ANNOUNCER 6A] And the
school that receives first place

11
00:01:31,041 --> 00:01:33,583
for the stage portion is...

12
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:36,750
[ANNOUNCER 6A]
As expected,

13
00:01:36,833 --> 00:01:39,125
the strong performance of
Rindoji Girls' Academy

14
00:01:39,208 --> 00:01:40,666
brings home the gold!

Why does she hold people
in such complete contempt?

[TOHKA] Shido?

26
00:03:41,083 --> 00:03:43,125
[MIKU] There. You see?

27
00:03:43,208 --> 00:03:44,666
I'm afraid you lost the contest

28
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:47,291
because you were too
dependent on your friends.

29
00:03:47,375 --> 00:03:49,750
And a promise is
a promise, my dear...

30
00:03:49,833 --> 00:03:52,208
Now you and all five
of the Spirits you sealed

31
00:03:52,291 --> 00:03:54,333
are mine to do with as I please.

32
00:03:54,416 --> 00:03:56,000
Isn't that right?

33
00:03:57,791 --> 00:04:00,625
Oh, you don't need to
feel apprehensive, though.

34
00:04:00,708 --> 00:04:02,750
I'll most definitely be taking
care of you all properly.

00:04:13,875 --> 00:04:16,083
First place? We won? Really?

38
00:04:16,166 --> 00:04:17,708
[ANNOUNCER 6A]
In the food booth portion,

39
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:21,541
Raizen High's maid cafe received
an incredible number of votes,

40
00:04:21,625 --> 00:04:24,333

at the eleventh hour!

[MIKU whimpering]

42
00:04:26,291 --> 00:04:27,291
[TONOMACHI] It's way simple.

43
00:04:27,375 --> 00:04:28,916
Miku cranked up
the pressure big time

during the stage
performance part...

45
00:04:30,666 --> 00:04:33,041
However, Rindoji's true
worth usually lies in their

46
00:04:33,125 --> 00:04:34,875
food booth's
excellent ultra-hotties

47
00:04:34,958 --> 00:04:36,541
per capita ratio, which,

48
00:04:36,625 --> 00:04:39,708
unfortunately, was
completely neglected this year.

Well, duh.
Of course we're winners!

52
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:48,625
Agreed. They never
stood a chance against us.

53

[SHIORI]
We won... We really won!

54
00:04:53,916 --> 00:04:55,958
You've got to
be kidding me...

55
00:04:56,041 --> 00:04:57,791
It doesn't make sense.

56
00:04:57,875 --> 00:05:01,291
There's no way they're
actually serious about this...

57
00:05:01,375 --> 00:05:03,583
Don't you know?

58
00:05:03,666 --> 00:05:05,833
I'm Miku Izayoi, you fools!

Just stop.

62
00:05:12,583 --> 00:05:15,083
My song won first place.

63
00:05:15,166 --> 00:05:17,041
I was supposed to win!

64
00:05:17,125 --> 00:05:18,125
Look...

65
00:05:18,208 --> 00:05:20,958
The reason that we won
may sound corny,

66
00:05:21,041 --> 00:05:23,791
but it has to do with that
"dependent on friends" thing.

67
00:05:23,875 --> 00:05:25,333
[MIKU] What do you mean?

68
00:05:25,416 --> 00:05:26,416
Simple...

69
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,666
I could never beat you
with my singing.

70
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:29,916
And so

71
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,708
the other students at
Raizen worked extra hard

72
00:05:31,791 --> 00:05:33,958
to help cover
for my shortcomings.

73
00:05:34,041 --> 00:05:36,958
Which means the humans
you arrogantly look down on

74
00:05:37,041 --> 00:05:40,625
can defeat you when they
come together as a team.

75
00:05:40,708 --> 00:05:43,291
Come with us.
Don't be alone.

76
00:05:45,541 --> 00:05:47,500
Shut your mouth.

77
00:05:47,583 --> 00:05:49,833
Friendship? Teamwork?

78
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:51,208
Give me a break.

79
00:05:51,291 --> 00:05:52,958
I've got news for you.

80
00:05:54,458 --> 00:05:55,875
You face me,

81
00:05:55,958 --> 00:05:58,416
and those platitudes
become meaningless!

weren't they?

bent to my will.

Let me go!

[MIKU] I don't even care about
the stupid promise anymore.

100
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,291
Because I will have my way,

101
00:07:25,375 --> 00:07:27,750
and there's nothing in
this world that can stop me.

102
00:07:27,833 --> 00:07:29,041
Now, then...

103
00:07:29,125 --> 00:07:30,666
You know what I want.

with my feelings!

is to stop Miku...

[YOSHINON]
Uh uh uh! That's dangerous.

00:08:53,625 --> 00:08:55,375
You can't hurt her anymore.

I won't let you.

Did you really think we'd
disobey our Mistress' commands?

00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:09,458
Scornful...

135

We won't let you
lay a finger on her,

136

[MIKU] That's a spot of
bad luck for you, little Shiori!

139
00:09:18,583 --> 00:09:21,791
I can't believe you brought
so many Spirits here with you!

140
00:09:21,875 --> 00:09:23,041
Plus...

141

They're all the types
of girls that I like!

[SHIORI] No way...
Not you too, Tohka.

[TOHKA] Shido!

146
00:09:53,041 --> 00:09:54,875
What in the world
is going on here?

147
00:09:54,958 --> 00:09:57,375
[SHIORI]
Tohka! You're not hypnotized?

148
00:09:57,458 --> 00:10:00,750
Huh? I can barely
hear you at all...

149
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:01,833
Oh!

150
00:10:03,375 --> 00:10:04,958
[SHIORI]
Your in-ear monitors...

151
00:10:05,041 --> 00:10:07,416
Wait... You left them in?

152
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:08,833
[TOHKA] Yep!

153
00:10:08,916 --> 00:10:12,041
I couldn't pick up the rhythm
very well with only one.

154
00:10:12,125 --> 00:10:14,291
So what's going on?

155
00:10:14,375 --> 00:10:15,583
Well...

156
00:10:15,666 --> 00:10:18,250
Miku is pretty much
in control of everybody...

157

Kotori!

158
00:10:19,375 --> 00:10:21,708
[KOTORI]
Yes. What's the situation?

159
00:10:21,791 --> 00:10:23,666
Things have gone
downhill in a hurry...

160
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:24,833
We're heading outside.

161
00:10:24,916 --> 00:10:26,958
Please bring Fraxinus
to pick us up.

162
00:10:27,041 --> 00:10:29,541
Huh? What are you saying?

163
00:10:29,625 --> 00:10:31,583
If you're dumb enough
to go against our Mistress,

164
00:10:31,666 --> 00:10:34,000
then you should stay

[KAWAGOE]
You dared to trick Miss Miku!

169
00:10:50,166 --> 00:10:51,583
Death will be your atonement!

He's right!
Drop dead where you stand!

[SHIIZAKI] Hey.
You're not affected, are you?

While I was analyzing
the sound on stage,

00:11:02,291 --> 00:11:04,750
everyone suddenly
started acting weird...

[ANNOUNCER 7A] Basic Realizers,

Commander!
Why is it powering up?

180
00:11:18,916 --> 00:11:20,833
Because I'm planning
to evaporate anyone

181
00:11:20,916 --> 00:11:23,416
who might oppose my
Mistress Miku in one fell swoop.

help me stop her!

I'll ask you
not to interfere...

185
00:11:28,875 --> 00:11:30,333
I can't let this end...

186
00:11:30,416 --> 00:11:32,125
I have finally found my utopia.

187
00:11:32,208 --> 00:11:34,583
[SHIIZAKI] You mean you're
not under her mind-control?

But there are more
important things to do.

So let's put an end
to this, shall we?

to go by that code name anymore.

After I get out of bed,
I have to wash my face.

Then, I eat breakfast and
head off to school with Shido.

[ELLEN]
Please remain calm.

advisable in your current state.

Why go to Miku's
place right now?

I mean, our time would be better
spent trying to save Tohka!

[KURUMI] Don't worry,
we'll go save Tohka.

in one of these crazy cups!

Come on! What are you doing?

00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:29,833
I apologize.
I must've been mistaken.

324
00:19:29,916 --> 00:19:32,125
Just thought it would
look great on Shiori!

325
00:19:32,208 --> 00:19:33,833
Oh, you saw that, huh?

326
00:19:33,916 --> 00:19:34,833
That's right.

327
00:19:34,916 --> 00:19:36,500
I just never had
a good opportunity

328
00:19:36,583 --> 00:19:38,125
to see it up close
and personal...

329
00:19:38,208 --> 00:19:41,458
I was hoping maybe you could
fix that situation for me!

330
00:19:41,541 --> 00:19:42,333
Hey!

331
00:19:42,416 --> 00:19:43,833
Would ya' cut it out already?

332
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:45,833
[KURUMI]
Don't be such a wet blanket.

333
00:19:45,916 --> 00:19:48,416
You only have to wear it
for a little while.

334
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:51,958
I really want to see the
adorable Shiori's angelic face

335
00:19:52,041 --> 00:19:54,375
trembling with
carnal humiliation.

336
00:19:54,458 --> 00:19:56,041
Stop it! Stay back!

337
00:19:56,125 --> 00:19:57,291
Leave her alone!

338
00:19:57,375 --> 00:19:58,916
--Leave Shiori alone!
--[KURUMI] Do it for me?

339
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,958
It'll be our special secret...

340
00:20:03,458 --> 00:20:04,708
That hurt...

341
00:20:04,791 --> 00:20:06,500
You okay, Kurumi?

342
00:20:06,583 --> 00:20:07,416
Yes.

343
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:09,208
I'm perfectly okay...

344
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:12,750
Because there was a big brave
knight who took the fall for me.

345
00:20:14,666 --> 00:20:16,458
No sweat...

346
00:20:16,541 --> 00:20:17,875
Oh no. You're hurt!

347
00:20:17,958 --> 00:20:19,791
Looks like something
scratched your cheek.

348
00:20:19,875 --> 00:20:23,583
Huh? Oh wow... That's weird...

349
00:20:23,666 --> 00:20:24,833
It's all right, though.

350
00:20:24,916 --> 00:20:26,666
A little spit should
clean it right up.

351
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:38,791
[SHIDO] What do you
think you're doing?

352
00:20:38,875 --> 00:20:40,958
You said it would
be fine with a little spit,

353
00:20:41,041 --> 00:20:42,458
now, didn't you?

354
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:51,416
What's that?

355
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,791
[KURUMI]
Is something the matter?

356
00:20:53,875 --> 00:20:56,458
[SHIDO] Tsukino Yoimachi?

357
00:20:56,541 --> 00:20:58,541
Well, now,
isn't this interesting?

358
00:20:58,625 --> 00:20:59,833
Look what I found.

359
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,083
But isn't that--

360
00:21:09,875 --> 00:21:11,833
[SHIDO] Hey. Hold on!

361
00:21:11,916 --> 00:21:14,625
[KURUMI] Zaphkiel, Yod shot!

362
00:21:17,291 --> 00:21:18,583
Kurumi!

363
00:21:20,916 --> 00:21:22,875
[KURUMI] Don't worry about me.

364
00:21:22,958 --> 00:21:25,166
Yod's power is recollection...

365
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:28,291
A powerful technique that
gives me a special inside-look

366
00:21:28,375 --> 00:21:31,458
into some of the
target's recent memories.

367
00:21:31,541 --> 00:21:33,125
Memories like what?

368
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:36,208
Like recollections
of a past life.

369
00:21:36,291 --> 00:21:38,666
[AI]
Reporting in, Mistress Miku!

370
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:40,333
Have you found that boy yet?

371
00:21:40,416 --> 00:21:42,083
The gross imposter?

372
00:21:42,166 --> 00:21:43,166
Yes, Mistress!

373
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:44,833
There's no mistaking it!

374
00:21:44,916 --> 00:21:46,750
That is so lame!

375
00:21:46,833 --> 00:21:48,916
Oh. Is that the case?

376
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,791
He was more elusive
than I'd expected...

377
00:21:51,875 --> 00:21:53,000
Well...

378
00:21:53,083 --> 00:21:54,708
Who finally tracked
the pervert down, then?

379
00:21:54,791 --> 00:21:58,291
I hope it's a pretty young lady,
so I can dote on her lovingly...

380
00:21:58,375 --> 00:22:00,583
But if it was a man...

381
00:22:00,666 --> 00:22:01,666
Oh.

382
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:03,083
I guess you can give him
a piece of candy

383
00:22:03,166 --> 00:22:05,041
and send him on his way.

384
00:22:05,125 --> 00:22:06,291
He, uh...

385
00:22:06,375 --> 00:22:08,750
Got found by like
a whole crowd of people...

386
00:22:08,833 --> 00:22:11,458
It's hard to pick
just one person to reward...

387
00:22:11,541 --> 00:22:13,375
That is so, so lame...

388
00:22:16,041 --> 00:22:19,250
[AI] He's outside.
Like he just showed up.

389
00:22:19,333 --> 00:22:22,041
Facing her head-on is crazy,
no matter how you slice it.

390
00:22:22,125 --> 00:22:23,916
Even if you thought
of a more certain way

391
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,625
to get you sent
straight to Miku,

392
00:22:25,708 --> 00:22:28,083
it's too late because
we're already here...

393
00:22:28,166 --> 00:22:29,250
Which means, at this point,

394
00:22:29,333 --> 00:22:31,041
your energy is better
spent figuring out

395
00:22:31,125 --> 00:22:32,416
how to persuade her.

396
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:34,375
Okay, fine.
I guess you're right.

397
00:22:34,458 --> 00:22:36,416
[MIKU] I've had all these
people out searching for you.

398
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:38,541
Instead, you come
to me on your own.

399
00:22:38,625 --> 00:22:41,666
You must have a great deal of
confidence in yourself, Shiori!

400
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:43,333
Or should I say...

401
00:22:43,416 --> 00:22:45,708
...Shido Itsuka!

402
00:22:45,791 --> 00:22:47,166
Miku...
