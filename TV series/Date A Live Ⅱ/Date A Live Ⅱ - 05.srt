Captain Kusakabe?

10
00:00:48,541 --> 00:00:50,083
This calls for
an independent unit

11
00:00:50,166 --> 00:00:53,208
from DEM Industries to the AST
and for them to be granted

12
00:00:53,291 --> 00:00:56,083
discretionary powers
during emergency situations.

13
00:00:56,166 --> 00:00:58,000
Forming a unit
like this is absurd!

14
00:00:58,083 --> 00:00:59,958
The AST might as well
have been bought and paid for

15

I agree.

[FEMALE VOICE] This area

in the last year
than anywhere else.

23
00:01:13,958 --> 00:01:16,416
We're the DEM soldiers
assigned to the AST.

[NARRATOR] The annual cultural
festival is just another battle.

Performers fight it out
on stage with their rivals.

28

Vendors compete with sales
from their stalls.

29
00:01:32,958 --> 00:01:35,250
And some wander the grounds
by themselves,

Nice. Couldn't ask for
a better sacrificial lamb.

What's this Tenou Festival

00:03:25,666 --> 00:03:26,916
It's the joint cultural festival

held by the ten high schools
here in Tengu City.

Tohka was so hungry
that she collapsed.

and her voice has been
described as "Audio Ecstasy".

165

But she still remains anonymous:

166
00:09:01,375 --> 00:09:04,416
A mysterious idol who has never
revealed herself to the public.

167
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:05,958
The fact that's
she's stayed off our radar

168
00:09:06,041 --> 00:09:08,583
for this long means
she's good at hiding out.

Hold on, there's that
other Spirit like you.

170

Miku has an extreme
distaste for men.

Only girls were allowed
into this concert.

That's not all!

Rumor has it at some
of her prior events,

female fans home!

Whoa! What're you saying?

178
00:09:29,833 --> 00:09:32,541
[KOTORI] It's entirely possible
that Little Miss Popstar Spirit

179

If that's true,

I won't be able to do
anything about her, will I?

Rest assured. We have a plan.

You'll need it, Sis!

Be confident and you'll be fine.

Okay. Ready! Let's go!

That Shido guy?

199
00:10:20,958 --> 00:10:22,083
Said there was
something important

that he had
to go take care of.

201
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:25,791
And so he asked me
if I would mind

with everybody in his place.

That is so lame!

By the way, who are you?

Oh, right. Hello there.
I'm Shido's first cousin.

No, scratch that. I'm Shiori.

Shido, what are you up to?

I'm on a mission.

Can you pretend
like you don't know me?

Sure. You can
always count on me!

That's nice, Shiori. Very good.

Now take something off.

No! What are
you doing that for?

Don't worry.

I'll still respect you.

are in the first building.

Uhh... I... forgot.

[KOTORI] You forgot?!

233
00:12:00,708 --> 00:12:02,500
I freeze up
when I get nervous!

[MIKU] There's no need for
you to be nervous around me.

But... It's also
irresistibly cute.

levels haven't dropped yet.

They're actually staying stable!

239
00:12:14,208 --> 00:12:16,458
I guess she prefers her
women dumb as a doorknob

00:12:16,541 --> 00:12:17,916
and helpless as a kitten.

241
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,250
Should be easy for Shido.

242
00:12:20,333 --> 00:12:21,541
We have our choices.

243

Make your selection!

244
00:12:23,708 --> 00:12:26,875
[KOTORI] Number 2 makes sense,
but why is number 3 so popular?

245
00:12:26,958 --> 00:12:28,583
[NAKATSUGAWA] Sounds perverted
coming from a man.

246
00:12:28,666 --> 00:12:31,666
But it might be just the thing
for the quirky Shiori to say.

247
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:33,000
[KOTORI] Hmm...

248
00:12:33,083 --> 00:12:35,583
It would help us determine
Miku's tolerance level.

249

Are you serious?

willing to sell me

for thirty thousand yen?

I don't want
to sell them to you,

but I'd consider trading them
for the ones you're wearing!

Besides, shouldn't I be the
one freaked by that question?

her some questions.

[SHIORI] So, uh...

I thought this place was
supposed to be off limits?

What were you doing
in here by yourself, Miku?

Yes!

I love feeling like everyone
needs to hear my voice.

feel the excitement

But not from you,

282
00:13:47,541 --> 00:13:49,833

you may never have heard of me.

in here if you don't tell.

Go ahead and set the table
for me, would you?

299
00:14:34,083 --> 00:14:35,208
It's so relaxing to just cook

and not pretend
to be a girl.

00:15:10,916 --> 00:15:15,333
Bum bum ba-dum.
Ba-dum. Ba-dum.

320
00:15:15,416 --> 00:15:17,125
Ba-da-boppa ba-dum!

321
00:15:20,625 --> 00:15:21,666
[KOTORI] They're here.

322
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:26,458
Is there something
we can help you with?

323
00:15:26,541 --> 00:15:27,666
Uh, yes please.

324
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:29,958
I met Miku in
Tengu Square yesterday.

325
00:15:30,041 --> 00:15:31,458
[FEMALE STUDENT 5A]
What, are you another fan?

326
00:15:31,541 --> 00:15:32,625
Not exactly.

327
00:15:32,708 --> 00:15:34,083
That's what they all say.

328
00:15:34,166 --> 00:15:36,416
I'm sorry, but this is supposed
to be her private time--

329
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,000
Hello again, Shiori!

330
00:15:38,083 --> 00:15:40,041
Yo! Wassup?

331
00:15:40,125 --> 00:15:41,166
[chuckles]

332
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:46,833
I wanted to say thanks.

333
00:15:46,916 --> 00:15:48,791
You really shouldn't have
gone to all this trouble.

334
00:15:48,875 --> 00:15:50,541
[MIKU] No trouble at all.

335
00:15:50,625 --> 00:15:53,458
I just had a very delicious
tea blend delivered.

336
00:15:53,541 --> 00:15:55,750
And it was so sweet of you
to come all the way out here

337
00:15:55,833 --> 00:15:58,333
to my school just
to return my handkerchief.

338
00:15:58,416 --> 00:15:59,875
I had to share a cup with you.

339
00:15:59,958 --> 00:16:02,416
This was supposed to be for
those girls earlier, wasn't it?

340
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:04,083
Feels wrong to take their place.

341
00:16:04,166 --> 00:16:05,916
Please, don't worry about them.

342
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,875
They're very obedient girls
who always do

343
00:16:07,958 --> 00:16:09,333
what they've been told.

344
00:16:12,625 --> 00:16:14,458
Wow! This really is good!

345
00:16:14,541 --> 00:16:15,500
[giggles]

346
00:16:25,041 --> 00:16:26,625
[KOTORI]
Everything's going smoothly.

347
00:16:26,708 --> 00:16:30,458
We might be able to get her
faster than we anticipated.

348
00:16:30,541 --> 00:16:33,125
[MIKU] You know...
You really are amazing.

349
00:16:33,208 --> 00:16:36,083
I've never had
anyone like you before.

350
00:16:36,166 --> 00:16:37,625
[MIKU] Shiori...

351
00:16:37,708 --> 00:16:40,041
Don't you feel like there's
something special between us?

352
00:16:40,125 --> 00:16:42,916
I think that you should
become a student at Rindoji.

353
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
[SHIORI] What?

354
00:16:44,083 --> 00:16:45,208
Now don't you
worry your pretty head

355
00:16:45,291 --> 00:16:47,083
one little bit about
your grades or the cost.

356
00:16:47,166 --> 00:16:49,375
I will personally request
that you be passed through.

357
00:16:49,458 --> 00:16:50,750
Hang on a second!

358
00:16:50,833 --> 00:16:53,333
It's kinda sudden to decide
on something like that!

359
00:16:53,416 --> 00:16:55,083
Please reconsider.

360
00:16:59,541 --> 00:17:01,958
I... The answer is still no.

361
00:17:04,333 --> 00:17:05,333
Hey, Shiori?

362
00:17:05,416 --> 00:17:06,958
What can I do for ya?

363
00:17:08,416 --> 00:17:10,791
Please take off
all of your clothes.

364
00:17:12,083 --> 00:17:16,333
Hey, I think you're great,
but I can't do that.

365
00:17:16,416 --> 00:17:17,416
[MIKU] I'm confused.

366
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,708
Why aren't you doing
what I tell you?

367
00:17:19,791 --> 00:17:21,625
So what does that mean, then?

368
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:24,583
Are you a Spirit, as well?

369
00:17:24,666 --> 00:17:27,291
[MIKU] There's no point
in trying to hide it anymore.

370
00:17:27,375 --> 00:17:29,458
After all, there's no way
an ordinary person

371
00:17:29,541 --> 00:17:32,541
could disregard
a direct order from me.

372
00:17:32,625 --> 00:17:35,833
And so I wonder:
What in the world are you?

373
00:17:35,916 --> 00:17:38,875
Are you a Spirit? Or worse?

374
00:17:38,958 --> 00:17:40,291
Are you working
for those Wizards

375
00:17:40,375 --> 00:17:44,041
who have been trying to
track me down and take me out?

376
00:17:44,125 --> 00:17:45,583
I um, uh...

377
00:17:47,583 --> 00:17:49,041
[KANNAZUKI]
What should we do?

378
00:17:49,125 --> 00:17:51,916
[KOTORI] If we try to cover
it up, it'll make things worse.

379
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,208
It's gonna be risky,

380
00:17:53,291 --> 00:17:55,916
but we should try
negotiating with her.

381
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,708
[SHIORI]
Look, I'm not a Spirit.

382
00:17:57,791 --> 00:18:00,250
I'm not a Wizard, either.
Just human.

383
00:18:00,333 --> 00:18:02,083
That is so unfortunate.

384
00:18:02,166 --> 00:18:03,375
Lying doesn't become you.

385
00:18:03,458 --> 00:18:04,791
[SHIORI] But...

386
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:07,541
I do have an ability that
seals Spirit powers away.

387
00:18:07,625 --> 00:18:09,708
[MIKU]
What is that supposed to mean?

388
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:11,750
Just what it sounds like.

389
00:18:11,833 --> 00:18:15,041
So far, I've successfully sealed
the power of five Spirits.

390
00:18:15,125 --> 00:18:17,333
As long as your powers
are completely sealed,

391
00:18:17,416 --> 00:18:19,750
the AST won't
be able to find you.

392
00:18:19,833 --> 00:18:20,833
Trust me, there is a way

393
00:18:20,916 --> 00:18:22,791
you can live
peacefully in our world.

394
00:18:22,875 --> 00:18:26,291
I give you my word you won't
have to be alone anymore.

395
00:18:26,375 --> 00:18:27,291
Miku...

396
00:18:27,375 --> 00:18:29,416
Trust me,
I just want to help you.

397
00:18:32,583 --> 00:18:34,208
[MIKU] You know something?
I believe you!

398
00:18:34,291 --> 00:18:35,833
Seriously?

399
00:18:35,916 --> 00:18:37,041
[MIKU] But...

400
00:18:37,125 --> 00:18:39,166
I don't need you to
seal my powers for me.

401
00:18:40,416 --> 00:18:42,208
The way things
are right now,

402
00:18:42,291 --> 00:18:44,166
I don't think I could
be much happier.

403
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:46,750
I have my powers
and a life of luxury.

404
00:18:46,833 --> 00:18:48,875
what more could I possibly need?

405
00:18:48,958 --> 00:18:50,250
Just keep on pushing.

406
00:18:50,333 --> 00:18:51,750
You have to convince her.

407
00:18:51,833 --> 00:18:52,666
Look, Miku...

408
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:54,041
You caused a major spatial quake

409
00:18:54,125 --> 00:18:56,166
in front of the train
station a few days ago!

410
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:57,541
But why?

411
00:18:57,625 --> 00:18:59,041
I'm not sure you have total
control of your powers

412
00:18:59,125 --> 00:19:00,375
like you think you do.

413
00:19:00,458 --> 00:19:03,541
[MIKU] Oh? So you know
about that nasty incident.

414
00:19:03,625 --> 00:19:05,250
Your concern is touching,
but honestly,

415
00:19:05,333 --> 00:19:07,791
you don't need
to worry about me.

416
00:19:07,875 --> 00:19:10,291
I've got absolute
control over my powers.

417
00:19:10,375 --> 00:19:11,833
The spatial quake
I caused the other day

418
00:19:11,916 --> 00:19:15,083
was not by accident, sweetie.

419
00:19:15,166 --> 00:19:16,625
What could I do?

420
00:19:16,708 --> 00:19:19,291
I'd never gotten the chance
to sing at Tengu Arena before.

421
00:19:19,375 --> 00:19:20,500
So naturally,

422
00:19:20,583 --> 00:19:21,958
when I passed it in
front of the station,

423
00:19:22,041 --> 00:19:24,208
I suddenly felt
the urge to sing.

424
00:19:24,291 --> 00:19:26,666
And I decided to let it go!

425
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:28,208
That's the reason you did it?

426
00:19:28,291 --> 00:19:30,250
Yeah, I just
couldn't help myself.

427
00:19:30,333 --> 00:19:33,333
The desire to make music
completely took me over.

428
00:19:33,416 --> 00:19:34,500
If your friends
had been there,

429
00:19:34,583 --> 00:19:35,583
they could have died!

430
00:19:35,666 --> 00:19:37,875
Did that thought
even occur to you, Miku?

431
00:19:37,958 --> 00:19:40,125
I suppose I would
have been upset.

432
00:19:40,208 --> 00:19:41,708
Really, you would?

433
00:19:41,791 --> 00:19:45,333
[MIKU] Then again, All the girls
totally adore me no matter what.

434
00:19:45,416 --> 00:19:46,875
I'm sure they
would be satisfied

435
00:19:46,958 --> 00:19:48,416
knowing that
they had died for me.

436
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:52,916
[SHIORI]
Because they totally adore you?

437
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,333
[KOTORI]
Shido! Try to calm down!

438
00:19:54,416 --> 00:19:55,875
[MIKU] Yes!

439
00:19:55,958 --> 00:19:58,625
I have legions of fans that
love me with all their hearts.

440
00:19:58,708 --> 00:20:02,083
They do whatever I ask,
whenever I ask them to do it.

441
00:20:02,166 --> 00:20:03,833
[SHIORI]
Then you might want to know...

442
00:20:03,916 --> 00:20:05,250
I hate you.

443
00:20:06,458 --> 00:20:07,666
[MIKU] Why's that?

444
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:10,000
You're intolerably
arrogant and prideful.

445
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:11,083
Even if everyone in the world

446
00:20:11,166 --> 00:20:13,625
chose to accept
a spoiled brat like you,

447
00:20:13,708 --> 00:20:15,333
I'd still hate your guts.

448
00:20:15,416 --> 00:20:19,458
And as much as they'd love you,
I'd hate you more.

449
00:20:24,583 --> 00:20:26,916
[MIKU] Hearing such
harsh words from you...

450
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,916
They make me
want you even more.

451
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,625
I have a burning desire
to tease you mercilessly.

452
00:20:33,708 --> 00:20:39,291
Until you come to me, crying,
your face streaked with tears...

453
00:20:39,375 --> 00:20:42,000
And shout, "I love you, Miku."

454
00:20:42,083 --> 00:20:42,875
Dream on!

455
00:20:42,958 --> 00:20:44,958
I will never belong to you!

456
00:20:45,041 --> 00:20:46,583
[MIKU] Oh?

457
00:20:46,666 --> 00:20:48,041
[chuckles softly]

458
00:20:48,125 --> 00:20:50,500
Then why don't
we play a little game?

459
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:52,958
If your school somehow
manages to win first place

460
00:20:53,041 --> 00:20:54,916
at the Festival, then...

461
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,583
...I'll agree to
let you seal my powers

462
00:20:56,666 --> 00:20:58,416
right then and there.

463
00:20:58,500 --> 00:20:59,958
[SHIORI] The Tenou Festival?

464
00:21:00,041 --> 00:21:01,291
[MIKU] That's right!

465
00:21:01,375 --> 00:21:03,541
I'm already participating
in the stage portion,

466
00:21:03,625 --> 00:21:05,500
so you should put together
a performance, too.

467
00:21:05,583 --> 00:21:08,250
But... You've got
a serious advantage!

468
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:10,000
Well, that's your opinion.

469
00:21:10,083 --> 00:21:12,541
The way I see it, I'm already
doing you a big favor

470
00:21:12,625 --> 00:21:14,666
by allowing you to compete.

471
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:16,625
Now, the other side of the coin.

472
00:21:16,708 --> 00:21:19,125
If Rindoji wins,
I will have you.

473
00:21:19,208 --> 00:21:21,166
Oh, and I also want
each one of the Spirits

474
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:22,708
that you already sealed.

475
00:21:22,791 --> 00:21:24,458
Will you agree to my terms?

476
00:21:24,541 --> 00:21:26,500
Or do you want to run away?

477
00:21:29,416 --> 00:21:30,833
[RYOKO]
Is this some kind of a joke?

478
00:21:30,916 --> 00:21:33,208
[JESSICA] No.
We're quite serious about it.

479
00:21:33,291 --> 00:21:34,541
And if you have
any issues with that,

480
00:21:34,625 --> 00:21:36,708
then you can simply
go wait outside.

481
00:21:36,791 --> 00:21:38,166
[RYOKO]
Did you say human targets?

482
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:40,333
Oh, hell no!
What is this crap?

483
00:21:40,416 --> 00:21:43,250
We're after Spirits, here.
We don't hunt down people!

484
00:21:43,333 --> 00:21:44,791
And not only that,

485
00:21:44,875 --> 00:21:47,375
the operation is in Tengu Square
during the school Festival!

486
00:21:47,458 --> 00:21:48,791
You want to fight
Spirits in a place

487
00:21:48,875 --> 00:21:50,291
where you're
guaranteed a crowd?

488
00:21:50,375 --> 00:21:52,250
[JESSICA] This is
a part of the ceremony.

489
00:21:52,333 --> 00:21:55,958
A cordial greeting to
our admired adversaries.

490
00:21:56,041 --> 00:21:57,750
Wait, what are
you saying? Hold on!

491
00:21:57,833 --> 00:21:58,958
[JESSICA] One more thing.

492
00:21:59,041 --> 00:22:01,166
Make sure Origami Tobiichi
doesn't find out

493
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:02,541
about any of this.

494
00:22:02,625 --> 00:22:03,708
[RYOKO] What?

495
00:22:03,791 --> 00:22:05,750
That's also a direct
order from the top.

496
00:22:05,833 --> 00:22:08,541
If you have any concerns,
feel free to tell them.

497
00:22:10,541 --> 00:22:12,625
[RYOKO]
What on earth was that about?

498
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,416
[RYOKO] Shido Itsuka.

499
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:18,333
Where've I heard that name?

500
00:22:19,875 --> 00:22:22,416
[RYOKO]
No. Wasn't he Origami's...?
