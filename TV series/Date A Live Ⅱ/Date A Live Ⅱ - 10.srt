Feelings... Feeling...

2
00:00:37,458 --> 00:00:40,875
Feeling too much... Still...

00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:25,333
[SHIDO grunting]
What the hell is going on?

[SHIDO gasps]

5
00:02:38,875 --> 00:02:43,208
[SHIDO]
Holy crap. Is that Sandalphon?

6
00:02:43,291 --> 00:02:45,333
No way. It can't be.

7
00:02:45,416 --> 00:02:48,625
Where am I? What is this place?

8
00:02:48,708 --> 00:02:52,458
You. Answer me. Where am I?

9
00:02:52,541 --> 00:02:54,458
Oh! I think that, um...

10
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:56,875
Well, as far as I know,
we're in the Japanese branch

11
00:02:56,958 --> 00:02:58,625
of DEM industries.

12
00:02:58,708 --> 00:03:00,916
[TOHKA] I have never
heard that name before.

13
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,875
Can you also tell me
why I have been brought

14
00:03:02,958 --> 00:03:04,208
to this strange building?

15
00:03:04,291 --> 00:03:05,208
[MIKU]
I can.

16
00:03:05,291 --> 00:03:06,250
You were kidnapped
by that Wizard

17
00:03:06,333 --> 00:03:08,000
standing right over there.

18
00:03:08,083 --> 00:03:09,541
[WESTCOTT]
Wonderful!

19
00:03:09,625 --> 00:03:13,708
This is the first time I've seen
such an excellent Inversion.

20
00:03:13,791 --> 00:03:18,166
Look, Ellen. That is
our dream, our dearest wish.

21
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:20,500
Now. It's time to work.

22
00:03:20,583 --> 00:03:22,208
Someone who is worthy
for you to defeat

23
00:03:22,291 --> 00:03:25,458
has finally appeared.
My strongest Wizard.

24
00:03:25,541 --> 00:03:27,250
The moment has come
for you to take the head

25
00:03:27,333 --> 00:03:30,791
of the treasonous demon king and
lay the foundation for our path.

26
00:03:30,875 --> 00:03:34,750
Yes. The hour is
at hand. I'm ready.

27
00:03:34,833 --> 00:03:43,500

Oh, Mana! Mana Takamiya!

29
00:03:49,416 --> 00:03:50,875
No, not this time!

30
00:03:50,958 --> 00:03:54,541
I won't lose to you anymore!
As long as I have the Licorice,

31
00:03:54,625 --> 00:03:57,166
I cannot be defeated!

32
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:58,458
[gasps]

33
00:03:59,625 --> 00:04:01,333
Get ready for Blastark!

34

How naïve.

35

[gasps]

36
00:04:11,583 --> 00:04:14,500
[MANA] You've reached
your limit. Jessica.

37
00:04:14,583 --> 00:04:18,208
The match has been decided.
Come quietly.

38
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:22,916
[JESSICA] Mana! Adeptus Two!
I'm still right here, Mana!

39
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,416
I never liked you;
did you know that?

40
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:26,916
You poor fool.

41
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,125
One wrong turn, and I
would've been like you.

42
00:04:31,208 --> 00:04:32,666
[JESSICA]
Why?

43
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:35,166
Why did Master Westcott and
Implementation Manager Mathers

44
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:39,666
appoint a little girl like you
to such an important post?

45
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:41,166
Why you?

46
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:44,291
I was definitely better suited
to be Adeptus Number Two!

47
00:04:44,375 --> 00:04:48,291
I... I don't understand why
they didn't choose me!

48
00:04:48,375 --> 00:04:51,291
Why have you always been
like this toward me, Jessica?

49
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:54,416
Why're you so unbelievably
hateful and jealous?

50
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,833
You go out of your way
just to be cruel.

51
00:04:58,666 --> 00:05:00,708
[MANA] I still respected
your loyalty even though

52
00:05:00,791 --> 00:05:02,625
I hated you in return.

53
00:05:02,708 --> 00:05:05,708
But that doesn't mean
you deserved this.

54
00:05:05,791 --> 00:05:10,291
No one deserves what's
happening to you. No one.

55
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:13,541

I'm strong. I'm strong, right?

60
00:05:36,583 --> 00:05:40,875
I won't lose to
anyone anymore...

61
00:05:40,958 --> 00:05:42,250
Do...

62
00:05:42,333 --> 00:05:45,958
Do you think Mister Westcott
will acknowledge me now?

63
00:05:46,041 --> 00:05:49,875
Oh, I want it to be
my turn this time.

64
00:05:49,958 --> 00:05:53,166
Yeah. I know he'll
acknowledge you.

65
00:05:54,666 --> 00:05:59,125
I-I hope you're right, Mana.

66
00:06:04,958 --> 00:06:09,750
[MANA] Isaac Westcott!
You'll pay for this...

67
00:06:22,375 --> 00:06:26,666
[ELLEN] Fine! Get ready!
Go, Rhongomiant!

No... Tohka, no! Tohka!

70
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:53,333
[TOHKA] I see. I suppose
you weren't all talk.

71
00:06:54,916 --> 00:06:56,416
[ELLEN]
I won't let you!

72
00:06:58,791 --> 00:07:00,375

00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,500

78
00:07:18,541 --> 00:07:19,958
Thanks Miku. Are you all right?

79
00:07:20,041 --> 00:07:21,625
I, um-- Yeah. Fine.

80
00:07:21,708 --> 00:07:23,583
But don't think for even a
second that I was trying

81
00:07:23,666 --> 00:07:25,708
to save you or anything
like that, Mister!

82
00:07:25,791 --> 00:07:26,833
Just a coincidence!

[SHIDO gasps]
Is that really... Tohka?

84
00:07:34,083 --> 00:07:36,375
[WESTCOTT] Thank you, Ellen.
That was close.

85
00:07:36,458 --> 00:07:37,791
[ELLEN]
No problem.

86
00:07:37,875 --> 00:07:39,916
We can't exactly have you
getting killed right now.

87
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:40,916
So, tell me.

88
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,291
What do you think of Princess?

89
00:07:42,375 --> 00:07:44,375
She's grown much
stronger than before.

90
00:07:44,458 --> 00:07:47,125
My opinion is, she's at
least a Triple-A rank.

91
00:07:47,208 --> 00:07:50,333
Really? All right then,
can you still win?

92
00:07:50,416 --> 00:07:52,208
[ELLEN]
I'm not sure.

93
00:07:52,291 --> 00:07:54,875
Nothing that lives on
this Earth can beat me.

94
00:07:54,958 --> 00:08:00,250
If I'm at my very best,
that is. Which I'm not.

95
00:08:00,333 --> 00:08:02,333
I was distracted while
defending us earlier

96
00:08:02,416 --> 00:08:04,166
when my wound opened up.

97
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:06,125
I've been controlling
my pain threshold.

98
00:08:06,208 --> 00:08:09,416
So I am at a slight disadvantage
when facing that Spirit.

99
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:11,625
[WESTCOTT]
Hmm. Understood.

100
00:08:11,708 --> 00:08:14,958
It seems we've no choice.
Let us retreat, then.

101
00:08:15,041 --> 00:08:16,250
We still have some time left.

102
00:08:16,333 --> 00:08:18,000
[ELLEN]
Only if you're certain.

103
00:08:18,083 --> 00:08:20,291
[WESTCOTT]
It's fine. I'm used to waiting.

104
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:21,625
It's good enough
that we were able

105
00:08:21,708 --> 00:08:24,541
to draw out
Princess' Inversion.

106
00:08:24,625 --> 00:08:25,708
On top of that.

107
00:08:25,791 --> 00:08:28,458
We were able see someone
rather unexpected.

108
00:08:28,541 --> 00:08:31,625
My apologies, but you'll
have to excuse us for now.

109
00:08:31,708 --> 00:08:34,041
Let us meet again,
if you survive.

110

Takamiya. I mean, Shido Itsuka.

111
00:08:37,541 --> 00:08:41,291
[SHIDO] Hey! Hold on a sec!
Do you know who I am?

112
00:08:41,375 --> 00:08:43,958
[WESTCOTT]
Oh, no. I haven't the foggiest.

113
00:08:44,041 --> 00:08:46,125
Not about Shido Itsuka, anyway.

114
00:08:46,208 --> 00:08:48,625
[SHIDO gasps]
Hey!

115
00:08:48,708 --> 00:08:51,208
[TOHKA]
You bastards are next.

116
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:55,750
Uh, what the hell is going on?

117
00:08:55,833 --> 00:08:57,458
I thought you two jerks
knew each other.

118
00:08:57,541 --> 00:08:58,708
And besides that.

119
00:08:58,791 --> 00:09:00,500
She looks super strong,
so I don't get why you

120
00:09:00,583 --> 00:09:02,416
had to come save her
to begin with.

121
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,083
I am so confused right now.

122
00:09:04,166 --> 00:09:05,250
[SHIDO]
Yeah, well, you're not alone.

123
00:09:05,333 --> 00:09:07,333
I'm not sure what's up, either.

124
00:09:07,416 --> 00:09:08,916
[MIKU]
By the way, I didn't forget

125
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,958
that you got stabbed in the
chest! Why are you still alive?

126
00:09:12,041 --> 00:09:14,791
[SHIDO]
It's, uh... an idiosyncrasy...

[MIKU, SHIDO yelp]

128

This is Sandalphon...

129
00:09:21,625 --> 00:09:24,750
I demand that you to tell me
why you have that angel?

130
00:09:24,833 --> 00:09:27,833
[SHIDO]
Tohka! What happened to you?

131
00:09:27,916 --> 00:09:29,541
Do you not remember who I am?

132
00:09:29,625 --> 00:09:32,250
Tohka? Are you talking to me?

[NAKATSUGAWA] 3D wide-range

[MIKIMOTO] Incoming data from
surface observation equipment!

138

[SHIIZAKI]
Turning on the image.

139
00:09:44,291 --> 00:09:45,958
[KOTORI] Thanks to the
building being blown away,

140
00:09:46,041 --> 00:09:47,625
the jamming is finally gone.

141
00:09:47,708 --> 00:09:49,500
What in the world
happened in there?

142
00:09:49,583 --> 00:09:51,083
[SHIDO]
I don't know!

143
00:09:51,166 --> 00:09:53,541
I took a sword to the back,
and then Tohka turned crazy town

144
00:09:53,625 --> 00:09:54,958
out of nowhere!

145
00:09:55,041 --> 00:09:57,083
Was it because of the
reverse flow of spirit power?

146
00:09:57,166 --> 00:09:58,500
Can she be sealed?

147
00:09:58,583 --> 00:10:01,041
Doubtful. This is
something very different.

148
00:10:01,125 --> 00:10:02,666
Unfortunately, I can't tell you

149
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:04,625
if she can be sealed
or not at this point.

150
00:10:04,708 --> 00:10:06,500
Either way, a sealing
would be impossible

151
00:10:06,583 --> 00:10:08,833
with Tohka's feelings
for Shido right now.

152
00:10:08,916 --> 00:10:10,833
[SHIDO]
Then what am I supposed to do?

153
00:10:10,916 --> 00:10:12,000
[KOTORI]
You'll have to make Tohka aware

154
00:10:12,083 --> 00:10:14,166
of who you are again.
If you do that,

155
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:17,041
then her happiness levels
will go back to normal.

156
00:10:17,125 --> 00:10:20,291
No pressure, bro, but we've
got one shot at this...

157
00:10:20,375 --> 00:10:21,708
Of course we do.

In the end, being myself
is the only thing I can try.

[SHIDO] Come on, Tohka...
Let's go home and eat.

If you say sorry right now, I'll
make all your favorite foods

161
00:10:32,416 --> 00:10:34,625

lunch, and dinner.

You're a gross idiot.

168
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,958
But you still managed to get all
the way here for Tohka's sake,

169
00:10:54,041 --> 00:10:56,666
so I'm giving you just one
chance to make this right...

170
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:58,375
Get ready, Shido.

171
00:11:00,625 --> 00:11:04,458
All right. Now it's go time

00:11:10,791 --> 00:11:12,666

[MIKU] I never had
anything but my songs.

182
00:11:38,041 --> 00:11:41,541
My music. I had nothing.

183

I always believed if
I didn't have my voice,

184
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:46,375
I was worthless.

185
00:11:46,458 --> 00:11:51,125
That nobody -- and no thing
-- would protect me anymore.

186
00:11:51,208 --> 00:11:55,625
But honestly. I wanted
to see it at least once.

187
00:11:55,708 --> 00:11:58,791

truly loved another person

188
00:11:58,875 --> 00:12:02,416
from the bottom of
their heart. If only...

189

[YOSHINON]
How strange.

194
00:12:21,041 --> 00:12:22,833

by chance remember

195
00:12:22,916 --> 00:12:24,750
why we're here, do you?

[YOSHINO]
You don't know either?

197
00:12:26,208 --> 00:12:28,208
[YOSHINON] Somehow,
I feel kind of strange...

198
00:12:28,291 --> 00:12:32,125
Like my power is slowly
being sucked away...

199

Attack!

200
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
[KAGUYA laughs]
That was nothing!

201

Did you see how we just
blew those girls away?

202
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,958
Question. Is this
a serious fight?

203
00:12:43,041 --> 00:12:44,833
Yoshino? Yoshinon?

204

It's... Shido...

00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,083
[SHIDO]
Yo, Miku. You okay?

211
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:14,000
[MIKU]
But, why? I don't understand...

212
00:13:14,083 --> 00:13:16,125
I always keep my promises.

213
00:13:16,208 --> 00:13:18,666
[gasps] Yeah well, so what?

214
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:20,458
It doesn't make
any sense at all...

215
00:13:20,541 --> 00:13:22,375
Are you trying to tell me
that if I ended up

216
00:13:22,458 --> 00:13:25,500
in the same bind as Tohka,
you would try to save me, too?

You bet I would!

He kept his promise. He kept it.
