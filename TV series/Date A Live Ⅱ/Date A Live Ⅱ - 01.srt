00:01:13,541 --> 00:01:17,125
[SHIDO] Thirty years ago, the
Eurasian continent was attacked

2
00:01:17,208 --> 00:01:20,208
by a massive "spatial quake."

3
00:01:20,291 --> 00:01:25,625
There were 150 million victims
of this unprecedented event.

4
00:01:25,708 --> 00:01:27,666
And now...

5
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:30,750
[alarm rings]

6
00:01:30,833 --> 00:01:32,166
[SHIDO groans]

7
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:33,666
[loud crash]

8
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:35,541
Whoa! What on Earth was that?

9
00:01:41,333 --> 00:01:42,666
Tohka, what's wrong?

10
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:43,958
[TOHKA] Oh, Shido.

11
00:01:44,041 --> 00:01:45,958
Look, I'm sorry.

12
00:01:46,041 --> 00:01:49,208
I accidently got the notes
I borrowed from you dirty!

13
00:01:49,291 --> 00:01:50,708
[SHIDO] What?

14
00:01:50,791 --> 00:01:53,708
I lost control when I thought
you would hate me for it.

15
00:01:53,791 --> 00:01:55,666
[sobbing]

16
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:57,208
Don't worry, it's all right!

17
00:01:57,291 --> 00:01:59,791
I won't hate you because
of something like that!

18
00:02:01,416 --> 00:02:03,416
What? Really, you won't?

19
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:05,375
Course not, silly.

20
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:08,958
[SHIDO] Yoshino!

21
00:02:11,583 --> 00:02:15,041
Oh, Shido. Look there.

22
00:02:15,125 --> 00:02:16,708
Yoshinon is...

23
00:02:18,625 --> 00:02:20,791
Yoshinon. Yoshinon.

24
00:02:20,875 --> 00:02:22,166
Calm down, Yoshino!

25
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:24,416
If it freezes any more,
I won't be able to save her.

26
00:02:28,833 --> 00:02:30,625
[YOSHINON] Yay!

27
00:02:33,291 --> 00:02:34,625
[YOSHINON] Hey, Shido!

28
00:02:34,708 --> 00:02:37,041
Thanks for saving me, as usual.

29
00:02:37,125 --> 00:02:40,541
Yes, Shido.
Thank you very much.

30
00:02:41,291 --> 00:02:41,916
[crashing noise]

31
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,291
[TOHKA] Sorry, Shido!

32
00:02:43,375 --> 00:02:45,500
This time I spilled the kinako!

33
00:02:45,583 --> 00:02:47,458
[SHIDO]
It's all right. I promise!

34
00:02:47,541 --> 00:02:50,333
That's not going to
make me hate you, either!

35
00:02:51,458 --> 00:02:53,500
[KIRIYA]
Master Sergeant Tobiichi.

36
00:02:53,583 --> 00:02:55,875
We'll be taking
disciplinary action.

37
00:02:56,958 --> 00:02:58,875
Wait, you can't!
Just let me--

38
00:02:59,791 --> 00:03:03,500
Sorry. Is this
a bad time for us?

39
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:05,375
[KIRIYA] Mr. Westcott?

40
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,375
[KOTORI] Am I not always
telling you to be careful?

41
00:03:09,458 --> 00:03:10,958
The Spirits' powers
will return to them

42
00:03:11,041 --> 00:03:12,708
if their emotional
states are unstable,

43
00:03:12,791 --> 00:03:14,875
so you gotta keep them happy.

44
00:03:14,958 --> 00:03:17,666
This is all because
you slept in too long!

45
00:03:18,458 --> 00:03:19,958
Give me a break, sis.

46
00:03:20,041 --> 00:03:23,125
I was up late last night because
I had to study for a test! Gah!

47
00:03:23,208 --> 00:03:24,708
Whatever.

48
00:03:24,791 --> 00:03:26,458
I still have work to do, so I'm
gonna head out in just a minute.

49
00:03:26,541 --> 00:03:28,041
Make sure you
spend time with those two

50
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:30,041
since you actually
have a day off.

51
00:03:30,125 --> 00:03:33,666
And don't forget the intercom,
just in case, okay?

52
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:36,208
But I have so much
studying to do.

53
00:03:36,291 --> 00:03:37,541
And on top of that,

54
00:03:37,625 --> 00:03:39,333
prepping for the school trip
is driving me nuts.

55
00:03:39,416 --> 00:03:41,125
[TOHKA] Our "Sugar tripnut"?

56
00:03:41,208 --> 00:03:43,875
Is it sweet? It sounds sweet!

57
00:03:43,958 --> 00:03:46,083
How did you get
"sugar" from that?

58
00:03:46,166 --> 00:03:48,500
Anyway, I'm counting on you bro!

59
00:03:48,583 --> 00:03:51,333
[MIKIE] Well, you must be
really relieved, Origami.

60
00:03:51,416 --> 00:03:52,666
[MILDRED] That's true.

61
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:54,250
Honestly, it's a miracle
that you got off with only

62
00:03:54,333 --> 00:03:57,208
a two-month suspension
after everything you did.

63
00:03:57,291 --> 00:03:58,916
[ORIGAMI] Yes. I agree.

64
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,416
Although,
I have to say I'm curious

65
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,583
why such an
important person at D.E.M

66
00:04:02,666 --> 00:04:04,458
would take the time to help you.

67
00:04:07,875 --> 00:04:09,500
[TOHKA, YOSHINO gasp]

68
00:04:19,208 --> 00:04:20,416
[TOHKA] What's wrong, Shido?

69
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:21,458
I'm fine.

70
00:04:21,541 --> 00:04:23,125
Just need to
go shopping for a bit.

71
00:04:23,208 --> 00:04:24,833
What do you want
to eat for lunch?

72
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:28,458
Oyakodon.

73
00:04:28,541 --> 00:04:30,250
I'll go with you. 'Kay?

74
00:04:30,333 --> 00:04:31,291
No, stay.

75
00:04:31,375 --> 00:04:32,666
Enjoy your breakfast.

76
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:34,208
I'll be right back.

77
00:04:34,291 --> 00:04:36,875
--See you later!
--We'll see you later, then!

78
00:04:36,958 --> 00:04:38,875
[YOSHINO] Oyakodon.

79
00:04:38,958 --> 00:04:41,916
Hey, Yoshino!
Guess what's almost on TV!

80
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,166
It's our favorite soap opera!

81
00:04:45,333 --> 00:04:46,708
That's it for sports.

82
00:04:46,791 --> 00:04:48,291
Now, on to today's weather.

83
00:04:48,375 --> 00:04:50,541
Last night, two strong,
fast moving hurricanes

84
00:04:50,625 --> 00:04:52,583
appeared in the middle
of the Pacific without warn--

85
00:04:54,916 --> 00:04:56,958
You're really leaving, then?

86
00:04:57,041 --> 00:05:00,541
I have to.
I can't stay here anymore.

87
00:05:00,625 --> 00:05:02,625
I'm tired of my life with you.

88
00:05:07,625 --> 00:05:10,333
[SHIDO] Uh,
What are you doing, Origami?

89
00:05:10,416 --> 00:05:11,833
I just found you.

90
00:05:11,916 --> 00:05:14,333
Yeah, because you
told me to come out.

91
00:05:15,625 --> 00:05:16,541
Forget that.

92
00:05:16,625 --> 00:05:18,208
What all's been
going on with you?

93
00:05:18,291 --> 00:05:20,125
After that incident, did--

94
00:05:23,041 --> 00:05:23,625
Origami...

95
00:05:23,708 --> 00:05:24,666
Shido.

96
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:26,500
It's kind of
hard to talk out here.

97
00:05:26,583 --> 00:05:29,125
Why don't we go somewhere
where we can be alone?

98
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
[SHIDO] Wait!

99
00:05:32,083 --> 00:05:34,833
Why are we in
the women's restroom?

100
00:05:34,916 --> 00:05:37,791
[ORIGAMI] No one
will get in our way here.

101
00:05:37,875 --> 00:05:39,416
[SHIDO]
What are you doing?

102
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,791
What are you doing?!

103
00:05:41,875 --> 00:05:43,708
Well, why else
would you bring me here?

104
00:05:43,791 --> 00:05:45,083
We are in a bathroom, Shido.

105
00:05:45,166 --> 00:05:47,375
[SHIDO] You're the one
that brought me here!

106
00:05:47,458 --> 00:05:48,791
I wanted to go somewhere private

107
00:05:48,875 --> 00:05:51,375
so we could talk about
what happened last month!

108
00:05:51,458 --> 00:05:55,083
I mean, I haven't been able
to talk to you since then.

109
00:05:55,166 --> 00:05:56,458
So um...

110
00:05:56,541 --> 00:05:57,958
What happened
with you after that?

111
00:05:58,041 --> 00:05:59,666
[ORIGAMI] I had a hearing
and was sentenced

112
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:02,333
to a two-month suspension.

113
00:06:02,416 --> 00:06:04,166
I see.

114
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:07,083
Although, I am still
not yet satisfied.

115
00:06:07,166 --> 00:06:10,666
The Flame Spirit, Ifrit.

116
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:14,916
I know you said she was not
the one who killed my parents.

117
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:20,416
But, you have no conclusive
evidence to prove that.

118
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,708
Yeah, technically,
that may be true.

119
00:06:22,791 --> 00:06:24,750
Please, though,
you must believe me!

120
00:06:24,833 --> 00:06:26,250
--I would never lie to you!

121
00:06:26,333 --> 00:06:27,583
--No, do not misunderstand.
--I would never lie to you!

122
00:06:27,666 --> 00:06:29,583
I really do want to believe
what you are saying.

123
00:06:29,666 --> 00:06:30,791
I do.

124
00:06:30,875 --> 00:06:32,666
And if it is at all possible,

125
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:35,750
I want to avoid
killing your sister, too.

126
00:06:35,833 --> 00:06:37,916
[SHIDO] Origami. Thanks.

127
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,541
I should be
the one thanking you.

128
00:06:39,625 --> 00:06:41,125
After all, I'm...

129
00:06:41,208 --> 00:06:44,333
I'm grateful you're
treating me like normal.

130
00:06:44,416 --> 00:06:47,958
I did sort of try to
kill your little sister.

131
00:06:48,041 --> 00:06:50,750
No... more than that.

132
00:06:50,833 --> 00:06:54,375
I practically killed you
three months ago.

133
00:06:54,458 --> 00:06:57,541
Guess I can't say,
"Don't worry about it."

134
00:06:57,625 --> 00:07:00,000
But even so...

135
00:07:00,083 --> 00:07:03,875
Origami, I want things
to stay the same between us.

136
00:07:03,958 --> 00:07:05,416
Is that a problem?

137
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:11,708
Well, then.
I'd better get going.

138
00:07:11,791 --> 00:07:13,125
[ORIGAMI] Wait...

139
00:07:13,208 --> 00:07:16,000
Shido. Tell me something.

140
00:07:16,083 --> 00:07:18,000
Are you human?

141
00:07:18,083 --> 00:07:19,791
[TOHKA] I'll make Shido's
room nice and clean

142
00:07:19,875 --> 00:07:22,375
to thank him for
making us breakfast!

143
00:07:22,458 --> 00:07:25,958
[SHIDO] What a good girl!
Thank you, Tohka!

144
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,541
Right! Let's get started!

145
00:07:31,125 --> 00:07:32,708
What is all this?

146
00:07:32,791 --> 00:07:35,666
I can't stay here anymore.
I'm tired of my life with you.

147
00:07:36,916 --> 00:07:38,458
It can't be!

148
00:07:39,541 --> 00:07:40,791
[NAKATSUGAWA] Oh no!

149
00:07:40,875 --> 00:07:42,375
Movement on Tohka's
happiness meter is dropping!

150
00:07:42,458 --> 00:07:45,583
It's going into Pattern C now.
That's a danger sign!

151
00:07:45,666 --> 00:07:47,250
[KOTORI] Tell me what
Shido is currently doing.

152
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:48,375
[MIKIMOTO] He left
the house to go shopping

153
00:07:48,458 --> 00:07:49,541
about twenty minutes ago.

154
00:07:49,625 --> 00:07:52,166
[KOTORI] What?
I told him to be careful!

155
00:07:53,625 --> 00:07:55,333
[WIFE 1A] Wait. Wait!

156
00:07:55,416 --> 00:07:57,958
Please think about this
more carefully!

157
00:07:58,041 --> 00:07:59,500
[HUSBAND 1A]
I did think about it...

158
00:07:59,583 --> 00:08:01,166
Which is why I'm leaving.

159
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:02,458
Face the truth.

160
00:08:02,541 --> 00:08:05,208
I can't be with you anymore.

161
00:08:05,291 --> 00:08:06,750
So goodbye.

162
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:09,958
[SHIIZAKI]
Tohka rushed out of the house!

163
00:08:10,041 --> 00:08:12,291
[MINOWA] Her happiness meter
is entering the danger zone!

164
00:08:12,375 --> 00:08:13,375
[NAKATSUGAWA]
She's heading in the direction

165
00:08:13,458 --> 00:08:14,750
of the supermarket.

166
00:08:14,833 --> 00:08:16,333
[MIKIMOTO] Speed: thirty-eight
kilometers per hour,

167
00:08:16,416 --> 00:08:17,583
with a tailwind!

168
00:08:17,666 --> 00:08:20,125
I think she's probably
heading toward Shido,

169
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:22,291
since he's gone shopping.

170
00:08:22,375 --> 00:08:25,125
Is Shido's location
the supermarket?

171
00:08:25,208 --> 00:08:27,583
[KAWAGOE] Actually,
location is unknown!

172
00:08:27,666 --> 00:08:28,958
[KOTORI] What did you say?

173
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:30,583
[SHIIZAKI] We can't connect
to the intercom, either!

174
00:08:30,666 --> 00:08:32,750
[KAWAGOE] It looks
like it's been sabotaged.

175
00:08:32,833 --> 00:08:36,708
[KAWAGOE] It's either the AST
or something more powerful.

176
00:08:39,125 --> 00:08:42,083
I always thought it was
more than a little strange.

177
00:08:42,166 --> 00:08:45,083
I know without a single doubt
that I shot you that day.

178
00:08:45,166 --> 00:08:48,250
And as far as what happened
during the last incident...

179
00:08:48,333 --> 00:08:53,000
Don't worry. I won't
report it to my superiors.

180
00:08:53,083 --> 00:08:57,000
[ORIGAMI] Because if they
decide that you are a Spirit,

181
00:08:57,083 --> 00:08:59,208
I may be ordered
to put you down.

182
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:03,125
I'm a human, okay?

183
00:09:03,208 --> 00:09:04,500
At the very least...

184
00:09:04,583 --> 00:09:07,083
That is what
I believe I truly am.

185
00:09:07,166 --> 00:09:08,458
[ORIGAMI] I see.

186
00:09:08,541 --> 00:09:09,666
You mean you believe me?

187
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:11,125
I already told you.

188
00:09:11,208 --> 00:09:13,750
I do want to believe
what you say.

189
00:09:13,833 --> 00:09:17,875
Someday, if you ever feel
like telling me everything...

190
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:20,291
I would appreciate
all the details.

191
00:09:24,416 --> 00:09:25,250
Shido...

192
00:09:25,333 --> 00:09:27,541
I was wondering if you're free.

193
00:09:27,625 --> 00:09:29,083
[SHIDO] What for?

194
00:09:29,166 --> 00:09:31,833
[ORIGAMI] I have to buy energy
drinks for the school trip.

195
00:09:31,916 --> 00:09:34,458
I want you to
choose them with me.

196
00:09:34,541 --> 00:09:36,166
Drinks for the school trip?

197
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:39,208
Hold on a second, why would you
want me to choose them?

198
00:09:39,291 --> 00:09:40,791
Because I want you to.

199
00:09:40,875 --> 00:09:42,916
[SHIDO] How come?

200
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,583
[ORIGAMI]
Because I want to you to.

201
00:09:46,083 --> 00:09:48,333
[SHIDO] As long as
I can go home first.

202
00:09:49,791 --> 00:09:52,000
[TOHKA] It's all right.
It's all right!

203
00:09:52,083 --> 00:09:53,750
Shido's not going anywhere!

204
00:09:53,833 --> 00:09:55,500
I'm only checking on him!

205
00:09:55,583 --> 00:09:58,500
I just want to ask Shido!

206
00:09:58,583 --> 00:09:59,791
[TOHKA] Shido!

207
00:09:59,875 --> 00:10:01,083
What? Tohka?

208
00:10:01,166 --> 00:10:03,208
[TOHKA] Weren't you going
to the supermarket?

209
00:10:03,291 --> 00:10:05,166
Did your stomach start
hurting or something?

210
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:07,708
[SHIDO] Uh, no. Not exactly.

211
00:10:07,791 --> 00:10:09,250
So, uh, Shido...

212
00:10:09,333 --> 00:10:12,166
There's something I kinda wanted
to ask you, if that's okay.

213
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:13,333
[gasps]

214
00:10:13,416 --> 00:10:15,708
Origami Tobiichi!

215
00:10:15,791 --> 00:10:17,291
Hello, Tohka.

216
00:10:17,375 --> 00:10:18,833
What do you think
you're doing here?

217
00:10:18,916 --> 00:10:21,250
[TOHKA] No, that's what
I should be asking you!

218
00:10:21,333 --> 00:10:22,458
Talk!

219
00:10:22,541 --> 00:10:24,125
Why were you in the
same bathroom as Shido?

220
00:10:24,208 --> 00:10:26,625
[SHIDO] Tohka,
there's a reason for that.

221
00:10:26,708 --> 00:10:28,958
It's our little secret.
Don't worry about it.

222
00:10:29,041 --> 00:10:30,000
[TOHKA] What?

223
00:10:30,083 --> 00:10:31,541
What is the meaning
of this, Shido?

224
00:10:31,625 --> 00:10:33,916
Meaning of what?

225
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,250
Oh no!

226
00:10:35,333 --> 00:10:36,916
Were you planning to raise
money to go somewhere?

227
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:37,833
Huh?

228
00:10:37,916 --> 00:10:40,625
Wow. How did you
figure that out?

229
00:10:40,708 --> 00:10:42,458
No! It's true!

230
00:10:42,541 --> 00:10:44,500
[sobbing]

231
00:10:44,583 --> 00:10:47,083
Why, Shido?
I don't understand!

232
00:10:47,166 --> 00:10:49,375
Are you tired of me?

233
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:53,125
[TOHKA sobbing]

234
00:10:53,208 --> 00:10:54,291
[SHIDO] Tohka!

235
00:10:54,375 --> 00:10:56,541
I'm sorry!
I'll see you later!

236
00:11:02,791 --> 00:11:03,500
[SHIDO] Hey, Tohka!

237
00:11:03,583 --> 00:11:04,875
[TOHKA] Don't touch me!

238
00:11:04,958 --> 00:11:08,083
You like Origami better
than you like me, don't you?

239
00:11:08,166 --> 00:11:09,375
Um... no, I don't.

240
00:11:09,458 --> 00:11:11,041
[KOTORI] Shido... Shido!

241
00:11:11,125 --> 00:11:12,708
Great. Yeah, Kotori?

242
00:11:12,791 --> 00:11:14,166
[KOTORI]
We finally got through!

243
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:16,583
What in the world
are you doing?

244
00:11:16,666 --> 00:11:18,458
[SHIDO]
Well, that's... complicated.

245
00:11:18,541 --> 00:11:19,958
[KOTORI] Anyway...

246
00:11:20,041 --> 00:11:21,541
Tohka's anxiety has been going
through the roof recently,

247
00:11:21,625 --> 00:11:24,083
which means her Spirit powers
are starting to return to her.

248
00:11:24,166 --> 00:11:25,875
Because her powers
have flowed back to her

249
00:11:25,958 --> 00:11:27,083
so many times now,

250
00:11:27,166 --> 00:11:29,000
It's extremely likely
that the spirit path

251
00:11:29,083 --> 00:11:30,541
is starting to waver.

252
00:11:30,625 --> 00:11:31,833
[KOTORI] The bottom line
is at this rate

253
00:11:31,916 --> 00:11:33,958
there might even
be a spatial quake.

254
00:11:34,041 --> 00:11:36,833
You need to do something
to make Tohka feel better!

255
00:11:36,916 --> 00:11:38,625
You want me to
make her feel better?

256
00:11:38,708 --> 00:11:39,833
Okay, but how?

257
00:11:39,916 --> 00:11:40,958
Come on,
it's what we've been doing

258
00:11:41,041 --> 00:11:42,416
this whole time, isn't it?

259
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,458
Don't act as if you've
forgotten everything.

260
00:11:44,541 --> 00:11:47,333
It's the basics of how we
choose to fight the Spirits.

261
00:11:47,416 --> 00:11:49,875
Where the AST tries
to annihilate all Spirits

262
00:11:49,958 --> 00:11:51,875
by attacking them
rather violently.

263
00:11:51,958 --> 00:11:54,416
[KOTORI] We at Ratatoskr,
on the other hand...

264
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:57,333
[SHIDO] ...take Spirits on dates
and make them fall in love.

265
00:11:57,416 --> 00:11:59,375
Aw, you remember, after all.

266
00:11:59,458 --> 00:12:00,416
Well, then.

267
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:02,166
It seems to me
that it's about time

268
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:04,458
to start our date!

269
00:12:04,541 --> 00:12:06,708
[TOHKA] A date? Really?

270
00:12:06,791 --> 00:12:07,708
That's right.

271
00:12:07,791 --> 00:12:08,916
Do you maybe want
to go shopping

272
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,708
and walk around town
for a little bit?

273
00:12:10,791 --> 00:12:12,041
What for?

274
00:12:12,125 --> 00:12:13,625
I mean, aren't you, like,
tired of being with me?

275
00:12:13,708 --> 00:12:15,375
No, of course I'm not.

276
00:12:15,458 --> 00:12:17,625
Look, I promise to buy you
anything you want to eat

277
00:12:17,708 --> 00:12:20,416
while we're out.
How does that sound?

278
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:22,291
Really?
You think that'll work?

279
00:12:22,375 --> 00:12:25,583
Well then,
what about kinako bread?

280
00:12:25,666 --> 00:12:27,791
[SHIDO] You can have
as many as you want!

281
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:31,541
I guess. Yeah.

282
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:33,125
Just for a little while, okay?

283
00:12:33,208 --> 00:12:34,458
Uh, sure thing.

284
00:12:34,541 --> 00:12:36,125
Let's get going.

285
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:39,708
[SHIDO] Oh, good.
It looks like this'll work out.

286
00:12:39,791 --> 00:12:41,000
[SHIDO gasps]

287
00:12:41,083 --> 00:12:42,666
[TOHKA screams]

288
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:44,000
[KOTORI] Shido!
Tohka's happiness meter

289
00:12:44,083 --> 00:12:46,541
is going down again!
Do something!

290
00:12:48,208 --> 00:12:50,291
Hey... It's totally
all right, Tohka!

291
00:12:50,375 --> 00:12:53,000
Trust me, there are plenty
of other bakeries around here.

292
00:12:53,083 --> 00:12:54,416
All the stores
can't be sold out,

293
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:57,083
so we'll find you
some bread soon enough!

294
00:12:57,166 --> 00:12:59,458
[SHIDO]
They can't all be sold out...

295
00:13:02,208 --> 00:13:03,333
[SHIDO] Really?!

296
00:13:03,416 --> 00:13:04,250
[TOHKA] Shido...

297
00:13:04,333 --> 00:13:05,958
Where'd the kinako bread go?

298
00:13:06,041 --> 00:13:07,000
Listen to me!

299
00:13:07,083 --> 00:13:08,375
I'm gonna take care
of this for you!

300
00:13:08,458 --> 00:13:10,750
How can every store
be sold out at once?

301
00:13:10,833 --> 00:13:13,500
Maybe they all had
them on sale or something?

302
00:13:13,583 --> 00:13:15,416
Hello, everyone. I'm back!

303
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:17,500
We can't have Tohka
going out of control again

304
00:13:17,583 --> 00:13:18,791
like she did this morning.

305
00:13:18,875 --> 00:13:21,083
So I bought out
all the kinako bread,

306
00:13:21,166 --> 00:13:22,875
just in case of an emergency.

307
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:24,083
[ALL] That was you?!

308
00:13:24,166 --> 00:13:25,500
[KANNAZUKI] Yes...?

309
00:13:25,583 --> 00:13:28,500
[KOTORI] Go take those
to Shido right now, you idiot!

310
00:13:28,583 --> 00:13:29,500
Yummy!

311
00:13:29,583 --> 00:13:31,541
Kinako bread
is really delicious.

312
00:13:31,625 --> 00:13:33,916
Shido, where did you
get all of these from?

313
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,333
Actually, you don't
want to know that, 'kay?

314
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:38,791
Okay. I don't
want to know that!

315
00:13:40,416 --> 00:13:41,791
[SHIDO] We're home!

316
00:13:41,875 --> 00:13:43,666
I'll start cooking
dinner right away.

317
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:45,625
[YOSHINON]
Welcome back, Shido!

318
00:13:45,708 --> 00:13:48,125
Oyakodon! Hooray!

319
00:13:51,625 --> 00:13:52,833
[YOSHINON]
Man, I gotta tell ya,

320
00:13:52,916 --> 00:13:54,833
I was really surprised
when you ran off

321
00:13:54,916 --> 00:13:57,791
out of the blue
like that, lady.

322
00:13:57,875 --> 00:13:59,166
[TOHKA] You were?

323
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:05,416
Weird. I could've
sworn I closed this.

324
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:08,750
Wait, the lock's broken.
How'd that happen?

325
00:14:08,833 --> 00:14:11,166
I spent all that time
packing for the school trip.

326
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:12,333
Man...

327
00:14:12,416 --> 00:14:13,666
I guess since Tohka's
calmed down a bit,

328
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:15,458
I might as well
get this thing fixed.

329
00:14:15,541 --> 00:14:18,333
I have to meet Origami, anyway.

330
00:14:18,416 --> 00:14:21,083
[SHIDO] Hey, I'm going out
for a while, okay?

331
00:14:21,166 --> 00:14:22,333
[YOSHINON] See you later!

332
00:14:22,416 --> 00:14:23,958
Later, gator!

333
00:14:25,833 --> 00:14:26,791
Yeah, hello?

334
00:14:26,875 --> 00:14:29,000
Oh, hi... Origami.

335
00:14:29,083 --> 00:14:29,916
Yeah, it's fine now.

336
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:30,916
[TOHKA growling]

337
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,458
[SHIDO]
Where do you want to meet?

338
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:38,333
[MISTRESS 1A] You have to keep
this a secret from your wife.

339
00:14:38,416 --> 00:14:40,375
This is our little secret.

340
00:14:40,458 --> 00:14:41,791
[HUSBAND 1A] Yes, I know.

341
00:14:41,875 --> 00:14:44,708
[MISTRESS 1A] She hasn't
found out, has she?

342
00:14:44,791 --> 00:14:45,916
Clueless.

343
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,125
Today, I brought home
her favorite treat,

344
00:14:47,208 --> 00:14:50,000
so she was happy and
didn't suspect a thing.

345
00:14:50,083 --> 00:14:52,000
No, it can't be!

346
00:15:00,083 --> 00:15:02,625
[WIFE 1A] Dear,
why are you doing this?

347
00:15:02,708 --> 00:15:04,041
[HUSBAND 1A]
I thought I told you.

348
00:15:04,125 --> 00:15:06,250
There's no particular reason.

349
00:15:06,333 --> 00:15:08,125
Our love wasn't real.

350
00:15:08,208 --> 00:15:09,875
It was just an illusion.

351
00:15:09,958 --> 00:15:12,166
No! Oh, Shido!

352
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,250
[TOHKA]
It can't be. It can't be!

353
00:15:15,333 --> 00:15:17,083
Shido isn't going anywhere!

354
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:19,541
He isn't. He isn't!

355
00:15:20,625 --> 00:15:22,375
[SHIDO] Sorry, is it
all right if we take this

356
00:15:22,458 --> 00:15:24,125
to the repair shop, too?

357
00:15:24,208 --> 00:15:25,666
Yeah, sure.

358
00:15:26,333 --> 00:15:29,375
[SHIDO] This is
our chance to get away.

359
00:15:29,458 --> 00:15:31,041
I can't stay here anymore.

360
00:15:31,125 --> 00:15:32,916
I'm tired of my life with you.

361
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,708
Goodbye, forever.

362
00:15:35,791 --> 00:15:37,166
[TOHKA screams]

363
00:15:39,208 --> 00:15:43,000
[TOHKA sobbing loudly]

364
00:15:43,833 --> 00:15:46,041
[SHIDO] Origami!
Hurry and get to a shelter!

365
00:15:47,166 --> 00:15:48,750
[sobbing]

366
00:15:50,083 --> 00:15:51,791
You won't let me
listen to the end, huh?

367
00:15:51,875 --> 00:15:53,958
You are such a tease,
my little Miku.

368
00:15:54,041 --> 00:15:55,208
--You know I can't get enough!

369
00:15:55,291 --> 00:15:56,291
--Sir, run away!
--You know I can't get enough!

370
00:15:56,375 --> 00:15:57,416
[AI] Are you kidding?
Like, why now?

371
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:58,833
I didn't even get my change!

372
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:01,000
Boo! That's so lame!

373
00:16:01,083 --> 00:16:03,083
[NAKATSUGAWA]
Shido! Shido!

374
00:16:04,208 --> 00:16:05,000
[NAKATSUGAWA] It's no use.

375
00:16:05,083 --> 00:16:06,250
He's not wearing the intercom.

376
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:07,625
[SHIIZAKI] At this rate,

377
00:16:07,708 --> 00:16:09,000
we won't be able to tell
him where Tohka is heading.

378
00:16:09,083 --> 00:16:10,333
That stupid Shido!

379
00:16:10,416 --> 00:16:12,375
I specifically said wear it!

380
00:16:12,458 --> 00:16:13,541
Can we get him an intercom?

381
00:16:13,625 --> 00:16:14,791
[KAWAGOE] Please wait!

382
00:16:14,875 --> 00:16:17,458
Shido is heading in the
same direction as Tohka!

383
00:16:19,083 --> 00:16:20,416
[SHIDO] I know her.

384
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,250
Tohka is definitely here.

385
00:16:22,333 --> 00:16:23,875
She has to be!

386
00:16:26,833 --> 00:16:28,291
[SHIDO] Tohka!

387
00:16:28,375 --> 00:16:31,666
Shido? But how did you know?

388
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:33,458
[SHIDO] How could I not know?

389
00:16:33,541 --> 00:16:35,125
I mean, this is the place
where we first...

390
00:16:35,208 --> 00:16:37,833
[TOHKA] Do you want
it back that badly?

391
00:16:37,916 --> 00:16:38,875
[SHIDO] What?

392
00:16:38,958 --> 00:16:41,208
[TOHKA]
You're going no matter what?

393
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:42,458
[SHIDO] Going where?

394
00:16:42,541 --> 00:16:45,250
You don't have to pretend!
I know everything.

395
00:16:45,333 --> 00:16:47,875
If you say you're
going no matter what...

396
00:16:52,458 --> 00:16:54,833
...then you can go
once you've defeated me!

397
00:16:54,916 --> 00:16:56,208
[SHIDO]
What are you talking about?

398
00:16:56,291 --> 00:16:58,708
I'm not going anywhere!

399
00:16:58,791 --> 00:16:59,583
You're not?

400
00:16:59,666 --> 00:17:01,208
There's no way I ever would!

401
00:17:01,291 --> 00:17:02,583
I mean I still
have to make dinner

402
00:17:02,666 --> 00:17:04,250
for you and Yoshino, don't I?

403
00:17:04,333 --> 00:17:06,125
And I have a test to study for!

404
00:17:06,208 --> 00:17:07,125
[TOHKA] But aren't you...

405
00:17:07,208 --> 00:17:08,750
Aren't you tired
of being with me?

406
00:17:08,833 --> 00:17:10,583
[SHIDO] I never said
anything like that!

407
00:17:10,666 --> 00:17:11,750
If that's the truth,

408
00:17:11,833 --> 00:17:13,791
then why do you
have your case packed?

409
00:17:13,875 --> 00:17:14,958
Isn't it the "goodbye box"

410
00:17:15,041 --> 00:17:17,166
that means we can't
be together anymore?

411
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:20,333
You brought this with you
to go meet Origami Tobiichi!

412
00:17:20,416 --> 00:17:22,375
It's just as I thought!

413
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:24,083
[SHIDO]
No, it's not as you thought.

414
00:17:24,166 --> 00:17:26,500
It's... the suitcase
I was planning to take

415
00:17:26,583 --> 00:17:28,166
on the school trip
with you next week.

416
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:30,125
[TOHKA] What? With me?

417
00:17:30,208 --> 00:17:31,500
Yes, with you.

418
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:33,500
Okay, then, does that
mean you really aren't tired

419
00:17:33,583 --> 00:17:35,250
of being with me?

420
00:17:35,333 --> 00:17:37,000
It's all right for us
to be together?

421
00:17:37,083 --> 00:17:38,583
[SHIDO] Of course it is!

422
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:47,750
[TOHKA] Shido!

423
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:49,416
Tell me you're not hurt!

424
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:50,833
[SHIDO] What was that?

425
00:17:50,916 --> 00:17:52,250
This is bad.

426
00:17:52,333 --> 00:17:55,000
There is too much power
flowing between them.

427
00:17:55,083 --> 00:17:56,416
I was afraid this would happen.

428
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:57,708
What did you say?

429
00:17:57,791 --> 00:17:59,416
Unfortunately, at this rate,

430
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:02,083
the overflowing spirit power
will destroy the town

431
00:18:02,166 --> 00:18:04,083
and eventually, Tohka herself.

432
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:05,125
[ALL gasp]

433
00:18:05,208 --> 00:18:07,583
Right.
Then this is an emergency.

434
00:18:07,666 --> 00:18:09,583
We must retrieve Shido
and discuss a strategy

435
00:18:09,666 --> 00:18:11,166
to make sure we keep
everyone safe.

436
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:12,875
We don't have
that kind of time.

437
00:18:12,958 --> 00:18:14,583
No matter what,
Shido cannot disappear

438
00:18:14,666 --> 00:18:16,083
right in front
of Tohka's eyes.

439
00:18:16,166 --> 00:18:18,125
We don't know what effect
that might have on her.

440
00:18:18,208 --> 00:18:21,416
All we can do now
is bet on Shido.

441
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:24,291
Come on, brother.
I believe in you!

442
00:18:24,375 --> 00:18:26,958
[TOHKA]
Shido, what's happening?

443
00:18:27,041 --> 00:18:28,708
I swear I'm not doing this!

444
00:18:28,791 --> 00:18:30,666
[SHIDO] I know.

445
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:32,791
I'm sorry, Tohka.

446
00:18:35,333 --> 00:18:38,041
[TOHKA] Shido! Stay back!
It's not safe!

447
00:18:40,083 --> 00:18:42,000
You shouldn't say that, Tohka!

448
00:18:42,083 --> 00:18:46,041
There's no way that I won't
make it over there to you, Okay?

449
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:52,416
[SHIDO] I'm the one
that made you anxious.

450
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:55,333
Even after promising
I would always accept you,

451
00:18:55,416 --> 00:18:57,750
I couldn't ease your worries.

452
00:18:57,833 --> 00:18:58,958
At least...

453
00:18:59,041 --> 00:19:00,333
At the very least..

454
00:19:00,416 --> 00:19:02,416
I'll make it to you!

455
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:04,083
Oh, Shido.

456
00:19:04,166 --> 00:19:08,000
Tohka! Take my hand!
Everything'll be fine!

457
00:19:44,625 --> 00:19:45,791
It seems we're in the clear.

458
00:19:45,875 --> 00:19:47,791
The spirit path
has been stabilized.

459
00:19:47,875 --> 00:19:50,333
I don't think we'll have
a problem for a while.

460
00:19:50,416 --> 00:19:53,416
What did you expect?
That's my big brother for you.

461
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:54,458
[chuckles]

462
00:19:55,416 --> 00:19:56,916
[SHIDO] Hey, Tohka.

463
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,958
So I was wondering, there was
something you wanted to ask me.

464
00:20:00,041 --> 00:20:01,000
What was it?

465
00:20:01,083 --> 00:20:02,708
[TOHKA] Nothing.

466
00:20:02,791 --> 00:20:05,875
Besides... I have my answer.

467
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:09,250
[WESTCOTT] Oh?

468
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:11,291
You found Princess, have you?

469
00:20:11,375 --> 00:20:12,666
Interesting.

470
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:14,666
She was supposed to have
disappeared from Tengu City

471
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:17,208
three months ago,
is that correct?

472
00:20:17,291 --> 00:20:18,250
[ELLEN] Yes.

473
00:20:18,333 --> 00:20:20,708
In addition,
there is this report.

474
00:20:20,791 --> 00:20:22,000
Fascinating.

475
00:20:22,083 --> 00:20:24,083
It says the Princess
is attending high school.

476
00:20:24,166 --> 00:20:26,375
[ELLEN]
Her name is Tohka Yatogami.

477
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:29,291
She is a student at
Raizen Municipal High School.

478
00:20:29,375 --> 00:20:30,791
The time she transferred in

479
00:20:30,875 --> 00:20:34,875
matches the time all traces
of the Princess disappeared.

480
00:20:34,958 --> 00:20:36,291
[WESTCOTT chuckles]

481
00:20:36,375 --> 00:20:38,875
You're kidding me.
Very unexpected.

482
00:20:38,958 --> 00:20:41,708
I think we should
check this out our way, then.

483
00:20:41,791 --> 00:20:46,291
I wouldn't want my most capable
asset to get rusty, now would I?

484
00:20:46,375 --> 00:20:49,333
I am counting on you, my dear.

485
00:20:49,416 --> 00:20:53,458
Ellen Mira Mathers,
mankind's greatest Wizard.

486
00:21:16,125 --> 00:21:18,916
[KURUMI] It's not
nearly enough yet, is it?

487
00:21:20,416 --> 00:21:22,500
Oh... Didn't expect to see you.

488
00:21:22,583 --> 00:21:24,583
Yes, it was just wonderful.

489
00:21:24,666 --> 00:21:27,875
Who knew someone
like that actually existed?

490
00:21:27,958 --> 00:21:29,458
I can't believe it.

491
00:21:29,541 --> 00:21:32,458
Sadly, now, I have to store up
time before I can go back again.

492
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:33,708
But still...

493
00:21:33,791 --> 00:21:35,666
There's no way I'm giving up.

494
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:37,041
[gunshot]

495
00:21:38,125 --> 00:21:40,833
[KURUMI] In order to use
Zaphkiel's final attack...

496
00:21:40,916 --> 00:21:42,083
Yod Bet...

497
00:21:42,166 --> 00:21:44,916
I need that person's
particular power.

498
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
[chuckles]

499
00:21:46,083 --> 00:21:47,875
And I will get it.

500
00:21:47,958 --> 00:21:49,916
Don't doubt me on that.

501
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,541
I will never, ever give up.

502
00:21:53,625 --> 00:21:55,666
Then I'll kill
the origin Spirit,

503
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:59,416
the earliest one to appear
in this world thirty years ago.

504
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:04,166
The source from which all other
Spirits came, the First Spirit.

505
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:06,916
I'm going to take it out
with my own two hands.

506
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,708
