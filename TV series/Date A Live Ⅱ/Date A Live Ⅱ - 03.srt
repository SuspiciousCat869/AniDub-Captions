1
00:00:33,583 --> 00:00:37,291
[SHIDO] Um...
What are you doing, Kaguya?

2
00:00:37,375 --> 00:00:38,916
[KAGUYA]
I'm joining you tonight.

3
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,666
You adore sharing
your bed with ladies

4
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:42,041
according to my kinswoman.

5
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:43,791
Your kinswoman?

6
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:45,833
[SHIDO gasps]

7
00:00:45,916 --> 00:00:47,333
What? Yuzuru?

8
00:00:47,416 --> 00:00:48,583
Implementation.

9
00:00:48,666 --> 00:00:50,458
According to my master,
this is the best method

10
00:00:50,541 --> 00:00:52,000
to get rid of sweat.

11
00:00:52,083 --> 00:00:55,166
[SHIDO] Your Master?
Stop that, Kaguya!

12
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:58,333
Wait. You mean
that you don't want me?

13
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:00,333
Why would she
need to lick him

14
00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:02,125
in order to get off sweat?

15
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:04,875
You obviously
do not know anything.

16
00:01:04,958 --> 00:01:07,208
[BOTH growling]

17
00:01:11,416 --> 00:01:12,583
Understood.

18
00:01:12,666 --> 00:01:14,458
My master said in order
to warm you up properly,

19
00:01:14,541 --> 00:01:17,458
I would need to have
skin-to-skin contact with you.

20
00:01:21,875 --> 00:01:23,125
Hey!

21
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:24,666
What are you snuggling up
to him like that for?

22
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:25,750
[YUZURU] Ignore.

23
00:01:25,833 --> 00:01:27,250
This action is
none of your business.

24
00:01:27,333 --> 00:01:30,208
The space under the blanket
belongs to adults.

25
00:01:30,291 --> 00:01:34,125
What?!
Don't you underestimate me!

26
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:35,666
[KAGUYA] Oh yeah...

27
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:38,458
Now, Shido, isn't this much
warmer than what she was doing?

28
00:01:38,541 --> 00:01:41,541
After all...
Yuzuru gets cold so easily.

29
00:01:41,625 --> 00:01:42,541
[YUZURU] Negative.

30
00:01:42,625 --> 00:01:44,125
Since Kaguya's
chest is lonelier,

31
00:01:44,208 --> 00:01:46,333
she cannot produce
very much heat at all.

32
00:01:46,416 --> 00:01:48,250
[KAGUYA]
What did you just say?

33
00:01:50,708 --> 00:01:51,708
[SHIDO gasps]

34
00:01:51,791 --> 00:01:53,166
[TOHKA] Hold it!

35
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:55,333
I will take care of Shido
when he is not feeling well!

36
00:01:55,416 --> 00:01:58,083
Let go. Shido is
waiting for me right now.

37
00:01:58,166 --> 00:01:59,250
[BOTH growling]

38
00:01:59,333 --> 00:02:00,833
[AI] Oh my gah, wait!

39
00:02:02,875 --> 00:02:03,833
We're here, guys.

40
00:02:03,916 --> 00:02:05,750
We can decide
this thing for you.

41
00:02:10,166 --> 00:02:11,458
This is Adeptus One.

42
00:02:11,541 --> 00:02:14,458
I can confirm that the
target has entered the room.

43
00:02:14,541 --> 00:02:15,458
[ARBATEL OPERATOR 2A]
Roger.

44
00:02:15,541 --> 00:02:17,166
Shall we deploy
the Bandersnatch?

45
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:18,500
Have three units
outside the room

46
00:02:18,583 --> 00:02:20,041
just in case they're needed.

47
00:02:20,125 --> 00:02:22,750
Know that Master Sergeant
Tobiichi is in there, too.

48
00:02:22,833 --> 00:02:25,041
Make sure that
the range of Territory--

49
00:02:25,125 --> 00:02:26,875
Did the target notice me?

50
00:02:29,291 --> 00:02:30,291
Ellen?

51
00:02:30,375 --> 00:02:32,166
Where in the world
did you come from?

52
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:35,166
[SHIDO yelling]

53
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:37,125
Stop moving!
It's hard to undress you!

54
00:02:37,208 --> 00:02:38,500
Agreed.

55
00:02:38,583 --> 00:02:40,041
You're acting like a
little baby going night-night.

56
00:02:40,125 --> 00:02:42,208
[SHIDO yelling]

57
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:48,541
[TAMAE] Everyone is
so energetic tonight.

58
00:02:48,625 --> 00:02:50,625
I suppose there's no harm
in letting them have their fun

59
00:02:50,708 --> 00:02:52,083
until lights out.

60
00:02:52,166 --> 00:02:53,500
Shido?

61
00:02:53,583 --> 00:02:55,375
I heard that you were sleeping
because you had a fever.

62
00:02:55,458 --> 00:02:57,958
--Are you okay?
--Please leave me alone!

63
00:03:03,041 --> 00:03:06,166
[CHORUS]
Hey, hey, hey, ho!

64
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:10,375
[SHIDO, TAMAE screaming]

65
00:03:12,541 --> 00:03:13,791
[NARRATOR] The school trip.

66
00:03:13,875 --> 00:03:15,875
The children are permitted
to buy wooden swords

67
00:03:15,958 --> 00:03:17,875
and then go to the girls' rooms.

68
00:03:17,958 --> 00:03:19,750
They worry about getting
caught by the teacher,

69
00:03:19,833 --> 00:03:22,500
and wind up falling asleep
on a quiet bus the next day

70
00:03:22,583 --> 00:03:24,916
because no one got enough sleep.

71
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,416
That single moment
can twinkle for a lifetime.

72
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,583
[PADDINGTON] Any word from
Miss Implementation Manager?

73
00:04:57,666 --> 00:04:59,375
[ARBATEL OPERATOR 2A]
Not since earlier, sir.

74
00:04:59,458 --> 00:05:00,208
[ARBATEL OPERATOR 2B]
There's no movement

75
00:05:00,291 --> 00:05:01,750
within the building, either.

76
00:05:01,833 --> 00:05:04,083
[PADDINGTON] Bring the
Bandersnatch back, then.

77
00:05:04,166 --> 00:05:05,750
Nothing is going
to happen tonight.

78
00:05:05,833 --> 00:05:06,791
[ARBATEL OPERATOR 3A]
Sir!

79
00:05:07,666 --> 00:05:09,625
[PADDINGTON]
That little girl...

80
00:05:13,291 --> 00:05:15,166
[REINE] All right.

81
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:17,000
Let's review the plan.

82
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:18,666
[SHIDO] Okay.

83
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:20,375
[REINE]
We'll have the Spirit Berserk.

84
00:05:20,458 --> 00:05:23,041
That is to say the Yamai
sisters, Kaguya and Yuzuru,

85
00:05:23,125 --> 00:05:25,333
spend today's free time
with you at the private beach

86
00:05:25,416 --> 00:05:26,833
where you are currently waiting.

87
00:05:26,916 --> 00:05:28,208
I'll tell them what to do.

88
00:05:28,291 --> 00:05:30,750
I've given them intercoms
to make that happen.

89
00:05:30,833 --> 00:05:32,625
The rest is up to you, Shin.

90
00:05:32,708 --> 00:05:34,041
[SHIDO] Got it.

91
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:36,541
From there I just, like,
pretend I don't know about them

92
00:05:36,625 --> 00:05:38,000
and let them win me over?

93
00:05:38,083 --> 00:05:39,500
Yes, exactly.

94
00:05:39,583 --> 00:05:41,500
If they understand and believe
that all they have to do

95
00:05:41,583 --> 00:05:43,916
to make you fall for them
is follow my directions,

96
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,375
I'll be able to control
their actions to some extent.

97
00:05:46,458 --> 00:05:47,583
At least that's the idea.

98
00:05:47,666 --> 00:05:48,833
In other words,

99
00:05:48,916 --> 00:05:50,416
as long as everything
goes the way you think,

100
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,958
there's a chance we could seal
both of them at the same time.

101
00:05:53,041 --> 00:05:54,041
[REINE] Correct.

102
00:05:54,125 --> 00:05:55,500
Judging by the girls'
current dynamic,

103
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:57,416
if you kiss one of them,
there's no way to know

104
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:58,916
how the other one will react,

105
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,458
but the assumption
is it won't be positive.

106
00:06:02,583 --> 00:06:03,958
[REINE]
Communications with Fraxinus

107
00:06:04,041 --> 00:06:05,750
have not yet been restored.

108
00:06:05,833 --> 00:06:09,000
However, if we do not seal
the elusive Yamai sisters now,

109
00:06:09,083 --> 00:06:10,875
we may never
get a second chance.

110
00:06:10,958 --> 00:06:12,625
So we have to make our move.

111
00:06:12,708 --> 00:06:14,833
You realize there
are many risks involved?

112
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:16,750
[SHIDO] Yes, I understand.

113
00:06:16,833 --> 00:06:20,125
I'll do what I can to seal
them without any fighting.

114
00:06:20,208 --> 00:06:22,541
[KAGUYA] Thus, Yuzuru or I
will become the new Yamai.

115
00:06:22,625 --> 00:06:24,416
For there can be only one.

116
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,708
[SHIDO] What happens to
the personality that loses?

117
00:06:26,791 --> 00:06:28,375
[KAGUYA]
It will cease to exist...

118
00:06:28,458 --> 00:06:30,125
[SHIDO] I'll try my hardest.

119
00:06:30,208 --> 00:06:32,666
I'm scared I won't
be able to do it, though.

120
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:34,041
[REINE] I believe in you.

121
00:06:34,125 --> 00:06:35,500
They're almost done changing.

122
00:06:35,583 --> 00:06:36,916
In order to avoid confusion,

123
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,958
I'm going to cut this line
of communication for now.

124
00:06:40,041 --> 00:06:42,375
Don't forget to compliment
them on their swimsuits.

125
00:06:42,458 --> 00:06:43,625
[KAGUYA] Ah hah!

126
00:06:43,708 --> 00:06:46,333
So this is where you've
been hiding out, Shido!

127
00:06:46,416 --> 00:06:48,958
[YUZURU] Discovery.
I have finally found you, Shido.

128
00:06:49,041 --> 00:06:51,083
[SHIDO] Oh, hey there,
ladies, how are you doing?

129
00:06:51,166 --> 00:06:52,791
Those swimsuits are incredible.

130
00:06:52,875 --> 00:06:54,625
You both look very pretty!

131
00:06:54,708 --> 00:06:56,083
Yeah. You better believe it!

132
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:59,541
Acknowledge. Thank you
for saying such kind words.

133
00:06:59,625 --> 00:07:01,500
Right. Understood and on it.

134
00:07:01,583 --> 00:07:04,166
Duly noted.
I understand as well.

135
00:07:05,375 --> 00:07:06,375
Hey, Shido!

136
00:07:06,458 --> 00:07:08,250
I demand you apply
divine protection

137
00:07:08,333 --> 00:07:10,666
from the miasma
of light on my body.

138
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:13,958
Request. Will you please
put sunblock onto me?

139
00:07:14,041 --> 00:07:16,500
[SHIDO] Um... sunblock?

140
00:07:16,583 --> 00:07:18,875
[KANNAZUKI] Oh, it's a chore
to work up much enthusiasm

141
00:07:18,958 --> 00:07:20,625
when there's nothing to do.

142
00:07:20,708 --> 00:07:21,916
I did what cannot be undone

143
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,916
and had counted on a good,
abusive scolding

144
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,041
from the commander,

145
00:07:25,125 --> 00:07:28,000
and yet, here I am
un-abused and alone.

146
00:07:28,083 --> 00:07:30,416
And as expected,
he's useless.

147
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:33,250
If only Analyst Murasame
were here instead of that.

148
00:07:33,333 --> 00:07:35,583
Well, maybe we should
try contacting her later.

149
00:07:35,666 --> 00:07:37,541
[ALL sigh]

150
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,916
This is steamy. Way steamy.

151
00:07:47,833 --> 00:07:48,958
[KAGUYA] Now, Shido.

152
00:07:49,041 --> 00:07:51,125
I am turning my back
to you with full trust.

153
00:07:51,208 --> 00:07:52,500
Don't let me down.

154
00:07:52,583 --> 00:07:54,666
[YUZURU] Request.
Please do this for me.

155
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:56,583
Yeah. Sure thing.

156
00:07:56,666 --> 00:07:58,000
Let me take a wild guess.

157
00:07:58,083 --> 00:08:00,416
This means I have to touch them
directly, doesn't it?

158
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,041
Hey, Shido's not applying it!

159
00:08:02,125 --> 00:08:03,833
That is not what
you said would happen!

160
00:08:03,916 --> 00:08:06,125
Inquiry. What
am I doing incorrectly?

161
00:08:06,208 --> 00:08:08,250
Um... Okay, here I come!

162
00:08:08,333 --> 00:08:09,458
[chuckles]

163
00:08:10,541 --> 00:08:12,000
Okay, Shido! Now!

164
00:08:12,083 --> 00:08:13,541
Put that protection on my back!

165
00:08:13,625 --> 00:08:15,000
[YUZURU] Negligence.

166
00:08:17,958 --> 00:08:20,291
Didn't you hear me? Jeez.

167
00:08:21,833 --> 00:08:23,250
[gasps erotically]

168
00:08:23,333 --> 00:08:24,416
Crap. I'm sorry.

169
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,041
That was cold, wasn't it?

170
00:08:26,125 --> 00:08:27,875
No. I'm perfectly fine.

171
00:08:27,958 --> 00:08:29,916
Keep going. Don't stop.

172
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,416
[SHIDO] Whatever you say.

173
00:08:32,583 --> 00:08:36,541
[KAGUYA moans erotically]

174
00:08:36,625 --> 00:08:39,291
Counterattack.
I saw an opening.

175
00:08:39,375 --> 00:08:41,333
Petition. Apply.

176
00:08:41,416 --> 00:08:44,083
Hurry and do me. Please, Shido.

177
00:08:44,166 --> 00:08:46,333
Uh, right. I'm on it.

178
00:08:48,166 --> 00:08:49,291
Wow. Cold...

179
00:08:49,375 --> 00:08:50,458
Oh my.

180
00:08:53,291 --> 00:08:54,583
[moans erotically]

181
00:08:54,666 --> 00:08:56,833
Um... You okay?

182
00:08:56,916 --> 00:08:58,041
Wonderful, yes.

183
00:08:58,125 --> 00:08:59,625
You are very good at that.

184
00:08:59,708 --> 00:09:00,750
Thank you.

185
00:09:00,833 --> 00:09:03,000
No fair! I get to be next!

186
00:09:03,083 --> 00:09:04,833
[YUZURU] Counterattack.
I will not allow it.

187
00:09:04,916 --> 00:09:07,208
[KAGUYA] Oh yeah?
What are you going to do?

188
00:09:09,416 --> 00:09:12,125
[SHIDO] I guess that I'll uh...

189
00:09:16,416 --> 00:09:20,208
[gasping erotically]

190
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:29,708
[SHIDO] Um...
Are you two all right?

191
00:09:29,791 --> 00:09:32,250
He doesn't know how
good he is at all.

192
00:09:32,333 --> 00:09:34,541
[YUZURU] Tremble.
God-like fingers...

193
00:09:34,625 --> 00:09:36,583
He's such a wolf.

194
00:09:36,666 --> 00:09:38,750
[SHIDO] A wolf? What?

195
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:46,541
[ELLEN] Arbatel.
The target is now on the move.

196
00:09:46,625 --> 00:09:48,250
Can you follow her?

197
00:09:48,333 --> 00:09:49,625
[ARBATEL OPERATOR 2A]
She seems to be heading

198
00:09:49,708 --> 00:09:51,500
to a private beach point-eight
kilometers northwest

199
00:09:51,583 --> 00:09:52,875
of your current location.

200
00:09:52,958 --> 00:09:54,458
[ELLEN] Then I will
head that direction.

201
00:09:54,541 --> 00:09:56,250
Please have the
Bandersnatch follow--

202
00:09:56,333 --> 00:09:57,500
Whoa!

203
00:09:57,583 --> 00:09:59,916
[AI] Haha! Oh my gah,
we so got you, Ellen.

204
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,125
Why would you do that?

205
00:10:01,208 --> 00:10:03,500
Because!
It's never not hilarious!

206
00:10:03,583 --> 00:10:05,083
I can't believe
we got you again!

207
00:10:05,166 --> 00:10:06,125
That's so lame!

208
00:10:06,208 --> 00:10:07,458
I'm sorry.

209
00:10:07,541 --> 00:10:10,083
I don't have time to play
around. I have to go.

210
00:10:10,166 --> 00:10:11,083
Whatever, girl.

211
00:10:11,166 --> 00:10:12,958
And since
you're already there...

212
00:10:15,916 --> 00:10:17,166
I know you
must think its fate

213
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:18,916
that we've been buried here
together like this,

214
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,250
but I already have
a phone girlfriend.

215
00:10:21,333 --> 00:10:24,541
But, with being all
buried and everything...

216
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:27,250
I can't exactly bring
her out to show you.

217
00:10:33,458 --> 00:10:34,791
I understand.

218
00:10:34,875 --> 00:10:37,041
It's simply a coincidence
that you guys are out here

219
00:10:37,125 --> 00:10:38,541
all by your lonesome!

220
00:10:38,625 --> 00:10:40,250
You bet!
That's what happened for sure!

221
00:10:40,333 --> 00:10:43,458
Mmm-hmm!
Yes, that's my kinswoman, Tohka!

222
00:10:43,541 --> 00:10:45,083
Hastening right
to her master's side.

223
00:10:45,166 --> 00:10:46,833
Very nicely done!

224
00:10:46,916 --> 00:10:48,416
Good work. Wonder.

225
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:49,958
I did not think Master Origami

226
00:10:50,041 --> 00:10:51,708
would ever come
to a place like this.

227
00:10:51,791 --> 00:10:54,000
Kinswoman? Master?

228
00:10:54,083 --> 00:10:56,333
[KAGUYA] Yes, she seemed
to have a bright future.

229
00:10:56,416 --> 00:10:58,958
So we performed a baptism
of darkness yesterday

230
00:10:59,041 --> 00:11:01,125
and exchanged bonds.

231
00:11:01,208 --> 00:11:02,250
[YUZURU] Explanation.

232
00:11:02,333 --> 00:11:04,333
I was moved by
Master's coquetry.

233
00:11:04,416 --> 00:11:06,958
I then asked to be her disciple.

234
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:09,250
[SHIDO] Right. I get it now.

235
00:11:09,333 --> 00:11:12,583
Moving on, what were the
three of you doing together?

236
00:11:12,666 --> 00:11:15,291
[SHIDO] Um... Well, that's
a funny story actually...

237
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:18,625
[REINE] I thought we could
play a little beach volleyball.

238
00:11:18,708 --> 00:11:20,166
[SHIDO] Reine!

239
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:21,625
[SHIDO] Why did you
show up like that?

240
00:11:21,708 --> 00:11:22,833
I'm confused.

241
00:11:22,916 --> 00:11:24,583
[REINE] Since Tohka
and Origami are here,

242
00:11:24,666 --> 00:11:27,916
we needed to change the
original plan we had discussed.

243
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,875
Now, you, Kaguya, and Yuzuru
will strengthen your bonds

244
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:34,125
by playing on the same team
and working together.

245
00:11:34,208 --> 00:11:36,958
Gregor, Jackson, and Spencer
are on this side.

246
00:11:37,041 --> 00:11:40,250
Alexander, Abraham, and Anthony
are on the other court.

247
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:42,041
[SHIDO]
What's she talking about?

248
00:11:42,125 --> 00:11:43,458
I wonder if this'll work.

249
00:11:43,541 --> 00:11:46,041
I don't think Kaguya and Yuzuru
will do well together.

250
00:11:46,125 --> 00:11:48,458
For that matter, neither
will Tohka and Origami.

251
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:49,916
[REINE]
Don't worry about that.

252
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:50,958
Yah!

253
00:11:53,083 --> 00:11:54,791
[REINE] I told them that I
would tell the winning team

254
00:11:54,875 --> 00:11:57,041
an embarrassing
secret about you.

255
00:11:57,125 --> 00:11:59,000
So they have the incentive
to work with each other,

256
00:11:59,083 --> 00:12:00,291
even if they don't want to.

257
00:12:00,375 --> 00:12:02,083
[SHIDO]
Why would you do that?!

258
00:12:02,166 --> 00:12:03,958
[KAGUYA]
What are you doing, Yuzuru?

259
00:12:04,041 --> 00:12:06,333
[YUZURU]
Rebuttal. That's my line.

260
00:12:06,416 --> 00:12:08,000
Don't get in my way, Kaguya.

261
00:12:08,083 --> 00:12:10,208
[KAGUYA] What do you mean?
You were in my territory.

262
00:12:10,291 --> 00:12:11,666
Don't overstep your bounds!

263
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:13,166
[YUZURU] Rebuttal.

264
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:15,125
I didn't think dim-witted
Kaguya would make it in time.

265
00:12:15,208 --> 00:12:17,000
[KAGUYA]
What did you say to me?

266
00:12:17,083 --> 00:12:19,416
Hey, calm down, girls.
Calm down.

267
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:20,958
All they do is fight.

268
00:12:21,041 --> 00:12:23,166
I don't think they're going
to be very difficult to defeat.

269
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:24,708
I'm disappointed.

270
00:12:24,791 --> 00:12:26,291
They don't know their place
if they think they can beat us

271
00:12:26,375 --> 00:12:28,500
while acting like that.

272
00:12:28,583 --> 00:12:31,708
[KAGUYA]
Well, Yuzuru. Shall we?

273
00:12:31,791 --> 00:12:33,625
[YUZURU]
Agreement. Let's do it.

274
00:12:35,458 --> 00:12:36,291
[KAGUYA] Nice, Shido!

275
00:12:36,375 --> 00:12:37,875
[YUZURU] Kaguya! Set up, now!

276
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:39,333
[KAGUYA] Understood!

277
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,583
[yelling]

278
00:12:48,708 --> 00:12:51,291
[KAGUYA] All right!
Did you see that?

279
00:12:51,375 --> 00:12:52,750
[YUZURU] Delight. Yahoo!

280
00:12:52,833 --> 00:12:55,166
[KAGUYA] That was perfect
just now, wasn't it, Yuzuru?

281
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:56,750
It went "whiz"! "Whiz!"

282
00:12:56,833 --> 00:12:58,500
[YUZURU] Affirmative.
That's my Kaguya.

283
00:12:58,583 --> 00:13:01,000
[KAGUYA] No, no,
that's my Yuzuru...

284
00:13:02,083 --> 00:13:04,875
I mean...
Don't get too excited, peon!

285
00:13:04,958 --> 00:13:07,791
You should be grateful that I
allowed my feet to step on you.

286
00:13:07,875 --> 00:13:10,583
Nasty. Now my hands
are extremely smelly.

287
00:13:10,666 --> 00:13:11,458
They stink.

288
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:12,916
You know what it reminds me of?

289
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,458
The smells of old, dried,
and fermented fish.

290
00:13:15,541 --> 00:13:17,791
[KAGUYA]
My feet don't smell like that!

291
00:13:19,666 --> 00:13:21,333
[REINE]
Shin, are you all right?

292
00:13:21,416 --> 00:13:22,541
[SHIDO] Yeah, I guess so,

293
00:13:22,625 --> 00:13:24,875
but I'm starting to
think this won't work.

294
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:27,166
[REINE] Honestly... So am I.

295
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:28,500
Shido?

296
00:13:28,583 --> 00:13:29,208
[SHIDO] Kaguya?

297
00:13:29,291 --> 00:13:30,500
There's, umm...

298
00:13:30,583 --> 00:13:32,208
There's something I
want to talk to you about.

299
00:13:32,291 --> 00:13:33,916
Is that okay?

300
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,416
[SHIDO] Yeah, sure.

301
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:38,291
Hey, Reine, are you still
telling the girls what to do?

302
00:13:38,375 --> 00:13:40,250
[REINE] No, I didn't
say anything to either one.

303
00:13:40,333 --> 00:13:41,125
I just ...

304
00:13:41,208 --> 00:13:42,666
I wanted to say that, uh...

305
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:45,791
[SHIDO] Uh... Why are
you talking normal?

306
00:13:45,875 --> 00:13:47,958
Ha! So you were taken
in by my little farce,

307
00:13:48,041 --> 00:13:49,125
were you not?

308
00:13:49,208 --> 00:13:50,750
Do you realize how
ridiculous you looked?

309
00:13:50,833 --> 00:13:54,000
Dancing in the palm
of my hand like a fool?

310
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:55,541
[KAGUYA] Hey, don't
look at me like that!

311
00:13:55,625 --> 00:13:57,958
I can't help the way I talk!
This is normal for me, you know!

312
00:13:58,041 --> 00:14:00,166
Funny, 'cause you
stopped doing it again.

313
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:02,416
Ugh! Well, yeah.

314
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:05,125
Since I am a Spirit,
I'm super amazing.

315
00:14:05,208 --> 00:14:06,500
And I gotta sound
like I can wield

316
00:14:06,583 --> 00:14:07,750
a bunch of power and stuff.

317
00:14:07,833 --> 00:14:09,583
Like how is that
not obvious to you?

318
00:14:09,666 --> 00:14:10,791
[SHIDO] Seriously?

319
00:14:10,875 --> 00:14:12,750
Whatever! It's annoying,
so I'm changing it!

320
00:14:12,833 --> 00:14:16,333
Now tomorrow you have to
choose me or Yuzuru, right?

321
00:14:16,416 --> 00:14:17,916
You know, to decide our battle?

322
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,541
[SHIDO] Oh... yeah?

323
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:22,916
Shido, I want you to
choose Yuzuru, and not me.

324
00:14:24,541 --> 00:14:26,000
Petition.

325
00:14:26,083 --> 00:14:29,125
Shido, please choose Kaguya
to win this match instead of me.

326
00:14:30,958 --> 00:14:31,708
[SHIDO] But why?

327
00:14:31,791 --> 00:14:32,833
Explanation.

328
00:14:32,916 --> 00:14:34,416
It is because Kaguya
is so much better

329
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,208
than I could
ever hope to be.

330
00:14:36,291 --> 00:14:39,291
Surely, you must realize
how incredibly lovely she is.

331
00:14:39,375 --> 00:14:41,208
[KAGUYA] I mean, Yuzuru's
super cute, right?

332
00:14:41,291 --> 00:14:43,083
She's not like overly
friendly or anything,

333
00:14:43,166 --> 00:14:44,416
but she does mean well.

334
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,625
Her boobs are huge and
she's like a moe character

335
00:14:46,708 --> 00:14:48,166
come to life!

336
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:49,625
[YUZURU] She likes to act as
though she is extremely strong.

337
00:14:49,708 --> 00:14:52,208
And the truth of the matter
is that she's in earnest.

338
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:54,791
Even so, she still looks like
one touch will break her,

339
00:14:54,875 --> 00:14:55,916
and I'm sure holding that body

340
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,125
can only be
described as heavenly!

341
00:14:58,208 --> 00:15:01,250
[SHIDO]
But... but then, you'll...

342
00:15:03,416 --> 00:15:04,416
Of course.

343
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,166
I'll disappear.

344
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:07,708
[SHIDO] I don't understand!

345
00:15:07,791 --> 00:15:10,291
[KAGUYA] Well, come on, it's
not like I want to disappear.

346
00:15:10,375 --> 00:15:12,791
But to me there's
something more important.

347
00:15:14,041 --> 00:15:16,500
I want Yuzuru
to get to live.

348
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:19,958
Desire.
I want Kaguya to get to live.

349
00:15:20,041 --> 00:15:24,208
I want her to see and
experience more of this world.

350
00:15:24,291 --> 00:15:25,708
You know I'm right.

351
00:15:25,791 --> 00:15:28,708
Kaguya is the Spirit most
suitable to be the true Yamai.

352
00:15:30,541 --> 00:15:32,083
I decided on a battle of charm

353
00:15:32,166 --> 00:15:34,375
because, well, because
no matter how you look at it,

354
00:15:34,458 --> 00:15:35,750
Yuzuru is cuter.

355
00:15:35,833 --> 00:15:37,166
Certainly.

356
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:39,166
No matter how you look at it,
Kaguya is the cuter one.

357
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:41,041
I only accepted
the battle of charm

358
00:15:41,125 --> 00:15:43,041
because I knew
she would win over me.

359
00:15:43,125 --> 00:15:44,208
Reminder.

360
00:15:44,291 --> 00:15:46,500
Shido, you have to
choose Kaguya tomorrow.

361
00:15:46,583 --> 00:15:47,500
If you do not...

362
00:15:47,583 --> 00:15:48,458
Then I'll attack
this whole island

363
00:15:48,541 --> 00:15:49,875
and your friends who are on it.

364
00:15:49,958 --> 00:15:51,666
--I'll blow them all away!
--I'll blow them all away!

365
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:55,125
[REINE]
Well, that was unexpected.

366
00:15:55,208 --> 00:15:58,291
I sensed no ulterior motive
behind what they said.

367
00:15:58,375 --> 00:16:01,000
This must actually
be how they feel...

368
00:16:01,083 --> 00:16:03,375
[SHIDO] To wish for
her own disappearance

369
00:16:03,458 --> 00:16:05,666
so that the
other one can live...

370
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,625
[SHIDO]
What the hell is going on?

371
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:19,833
Shido.

372
00:16:19,916 --> 00:16:21,583
I want you to choose Yuzuru,
and not me.

373
00:16:21,666 --> 00:16:23,125
Petition.

374
00:16:23,208 --> 00:16:26,166
Shido, please choose Kaguya
to win this match instead of me.

375
00:16:27,208 --> 00:16:29,666
[TOHKA] Shido. Shido!

376
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:30,666
[SHIDO]
Tohka...

377
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:32,083
You finally heard me.

378
00:16:32,166 --> 00:16:34,375
I was calling out
for you this whole time.

379
00:16:34,458 --> 00:16:35,708
Sorry 'bout that.

380
00:16:35,791 --> 00:16:36,958
Hey, Shido.

381
00:16:37,041 --> 00:16:39,375
Do you maybe wanna
go see the ocean at night?

382
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:43,458
[SHIIZAKI] Analyst Murasame,
please respond.

383
00:16:43,541 --> 00:16:44,708
This is Fraxinus.

384
00:16:44,791 --> 00:16:46,208
Analyst Murasame!

385
00:16:46,291 --> 00:16:48,416
It's no use.
I can't get through.

386
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,458
And I can't get through
to Shido's line, either.

387
00:16:50,541 --> 00:16:51,500
That's strange.

388
00:16:51,583 --> 00:16:52,958
Looking at these readings,

389
00:16:53,041 --> 00:16:55,458
I doubt it's as simple as
a transmission malfunction.

390
00:16:55,541 --> 00:16:57,750
Artificial interference, huh...

391
00:16:57,833 --> 00:17:00,041
Then who could be responsible?

392
00:17:00,125 --> 00:17:02,125
[KANNAZUKI] Hey, guys.
What's going on?

393
00:17:02,208 --> 00:17:03,166
[ALL] Huh?

394
00:17:04,541 --> 00:17:06,291
[ELLEN]
Arbatel, can you see her?

395
00:17:06,375 --> 00:17:07,666
The target is
currently on the move

396
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:09,750
along the coast
with a male student.

397
00:17:09,833 --> 00:17:11,916
I will now commence the attack.

398
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:12,958
[ARBATEL OPERATOR 2A]
Roger that.

399
00:17:13,041 --> 00:17:14,958
Also, have a
Bandersnatch on standby

400
00:17:15,041 --> 00:17:17,000
as close to
the hotel as possible.

401
00:17:17,083 --> 00:17:19,625
I'm concerned about
Master Sergeant Tobiichi.

402
00:17:19,708 --> 00:17:22,625
We can't afford for her
to see any suspicious movements.

403
00:17:26,458 --> 00:17:27,958
[TOHKA] Sorry, Shido.

404
00:17:28,041 --> 00:17:30,083
[SHIDO] Huh? What for?

405
00:17:30,166 --> 00:17:31,791
[TOHKA] When I said
I wanted to go for a walk

406
00:17:31,875 --> 00:17:35,500
to see the ocean at night,
it was kind of a little lie.

407
00:17:35,583 --> 00:17:37,708
[TOHKA] Even though we came
on this school trip together...

408
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:41,083
I don't feel like--like we've
been able to talk that much.

409
00:17:41,166 --> 00:17:43,750
And so I wanted some time alone!

410
00:17:43,833 --> 00:17:47,208
Just the two of us,
if that's okay?

411
00:17:47,291 --> 00:17:50,000
But if you're angry,
I understand.

412
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,375
[TOHKA] Anyway, Shido,
what happened earlier?

413
00:17:56,458 --> 00:17:58,500
[SHIDO] What...
Uh, what do you mean?

414
00:17:58,583 --> 00:17:59,791
[TOHKA] I don't know why,

415
00:17:59,875 --> 00:18:00,958
but I feel like
you've been worried

416
00:18:01,041 --> 00:18:02,958
about something recently.

417
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:05,875
But, uh, if it's nothing,
then that's great!

418
00:18:05,958 --> 00:18:07,375
Tell me, Tohka.

419
00:18:07,458 --> 00:18:09,583
Did you bring me out here
just because you were worried?

420
00:18:09,666 --> 00:18:11,833
Yeah.
Well, I guess not entirely.

421
00:18:11,916 --> 00:18:13,708
I still wanted some alone time.

422
00:18:13,791 --> 00:18:15,708
You can't blame me for that!

423
00:18:18,166 --> 00:18:22,791
Tohka, can I...
ask for your advice?

424
00:18:22,875 --> 00:18:25,375
Sure!
By all means, ask away!

427
00:18:27,791 --> 00:18:29,083
[ARBATEL OPERATOR 3A]
Captain, we have reports

428
00:18:29,166 --> 00:18:31,250
of a mysterious source
intermittently communicating

429
00:18:31,333 --> 00:18:32,875
with Arubi Island, sir.

430
00:18:32,958 --> 00:18:34,458
We do?

431
00:18:34,541 --> 00:18:35,666
[ARBATEL OPERATOR 3A] I believe
it is trying different patterns

432
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:37,791
in an attempt to get
around the interference.

433
00:18:39,625 --> 00:18:43,458
[TOHKA] Seriously?
Like Kaguya and Yuzuru do?

434
00:18:43,541 --> 00:18:45,750
That's right.
They both separately told me

435
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:47,166
they want the other to live.

436
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:50,083
Even if that means that
they will no longer exist.

437
00:18:50,166 --> 00:18:51,583
It's weird.
As much as they argue,

438
00:18:51,666 --> 00:18:54,416
I never thought they felt
that way about each other.

439
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,208
Well, who would have?

440
00:18:56,291 --> 00:18:59,583
Though I must say
I understand it...

441
00:18:59,666 --> 00:19:01,333
If I were told
that if I didn't die,

442
00:19:01,416 --> 00:19:05,625
you would, then
I'd probably do the same.

Okay.

I've been told that,

Approaching target coordinates!

475
00:20:47,875 --> 00:20:50,250
[MIKIMOTO] No reaction
to the Permanent Territory.

476
00:20:50,333 --> 00:20:51,291
Very well.

477
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:55,208
Now. Ready the Yggdrafolium!
Deploy!

478
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:09,291
Captain!

479
00:21:09,375 --> 00:21:10,791
The radar's
picking up something!

480
00:21:11,708 --> 00:21:13,000
[ARBATEL OPERATOR 2B]
Is it an aircraft?

481
00:21:13,083 --> 00:21:14,208
No, wait a sec!

482
00:21:14,291 --> 00:21:15,708
Sir, it's an airship!

483
00:21:17,458 --> 00:21:18,583
[ARBATEL OPERATOR 2A]
The signal's gone!

484
00:21:18,666 --> 00:21:20,791
[PADDINGTON]
The Ratatoskr Organization...

485
00:21:20,875 --> 00:21:23,583
When you see that ship again,
I want it taken down.

486
00:21:23,666 --> 00:21:24,541
Fire at will!

487
00:21:24,625 --> 00:21:26,750
Yes! This is my lucky day!

488
00:21:26,833 --> 00:21:28,375
Prepare the main artillery!

489
00:21:28,458 --> 00:21:30,833
Have Ashcroft beta devices
ten through twenty

490
00:21:30,916 --> 00:21:32,583
start producing magical power!

491
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:35,875
Our target is a warship
of unknown affiliation!

492
00:21:37,916 --> 00:21:39,833
So what the hell
was all that about, huh?

493
00:21:39,916 --> 00:21:42,250
A joke?
Why tell him to choose me?

494
00:21:42,333 --> 00:21:43,333
Rebuttal.

495
00:21:43,416 --> 00:21:45,666
What about you?
What is your intention?

496
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:46,916
It's no use.

497
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,375
I thought this method
would give us the chance

498
00:21:48,458 --> 00:21:50,125
to finally decide
fair and square,

499
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:52,583
but I guess that I must have
forgotten to add your idiocy

500
00:21:52,666 --> 00:21:54,291
into the equation.

501
00:21:54,375 --> 00:21:55,791
Agreement.

502
00:21:55,875 --> 00:21:57,666
I cannot take any more of your
immense stupidity, either.

503
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:59,708
Perhaps it was asking
too much to have someone else

504
00:21:59,791 --> 00:22:01,500
end a duel we started ourselves.

505
00:22:01,583 --> 00:22:03,958
After all,
look where we've ended up.

506
00:22:04,041 --> 00:22:05,208
[KAGUYA]
Looks like we're gonna have to

507
00:22:05,291 --> 00:22:07,125
take care of it ourselves
no matter what...

508
00:22:07,208 --> 00:22:08,708
The dueling method is...

509
00:22:08,791 --> 00:22:10,291
Naturally, I already know.

510
00:22:10,375 --> 00:22:12,500
[BOTH] Whoever falls first
is the winner!

511
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:19,458
[SHIDO]
No, they have to stop...

512
00:22:19,541 --> 00:22:22,125
[SHIDO]
Please stop!
