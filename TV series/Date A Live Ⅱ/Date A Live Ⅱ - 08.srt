1
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:31,416
[SHIDO] Kurumi?

2
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:33,166
This might've been a mistake.

3
00:00:36,583 --> 00:00:37,625
[groans]

4
00:00:40,958 --> 00:00:42,375
[SHIDO] A time-eating castle?

5
00:00:42,458 --> 00:00:44,625
[KURUMI giggling]

6
00:00:44,708 --> 00:00:47,125
[MIKU] Wait...
Who is that with him?

7
00:00:47,208 --> 00:00:50,083
Don't tell me
she's a Spirit as well.

8
00:00:50,166 --> 00:00:52,166
She doesn't seem
the slightest bit affected

9
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:54,541
by my performance.

10
00:00:54,625 --> 00:00:55,958
[SHIORI] But...

11
00:00:56,041 --> 00:00:58,250
I do have an ability that
seals Spirit powers away.

12
00:00:58,333 --> 00:00:59,791
[MIKU] Impudent fool...

13
00:00:59,875 --> 00:01:02,833
As if I'd ever
give you the chance!

14
00:01:02,916 --> 00:01:05,791
If I did, it would
be just like before.

15
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:11,333
They can't stop us.
The show must go on!

16
00:01:15,083 --> 00:01:17,375
[NARRATOR]
Two stand against many...

17
00:01:17,458 --> 00:01:19,500
To save the trapped Spirits...

18
00:01:19,583 --> 00:01:21,875
To bring them to his side...

19
00:01:21,958 --> 00:01:26,041
To the side of the one with
the strength to subdue Spirits.

20
00:02:58,958 --> 00:03:00,083
[SHIDO] Miku!

21
00:03:00,166 --> 00:03:01,250
[sighs]

22
00:03:01,333 --> 00:03:03,208
Your voice really
grates on my nerves...

23
00:03:03,291 --> 00:03:04,958
Can you please refrain
from contaminating

24
00:03:05,041 --> 00:03:07,291
the eardrums of these
lovely Spirits or myself

25
00:03:07,375 --> 00:03:09,416
with that obnoxious clamoring?

26
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:11,458
I find it most unpleasant.

27
00:03:11,541 --> 00:03:14,541
You're so beyond worthless
that it makes me nauseated.

28
00:03:14,625 --> 00:03:16,083
Shut your foul mouth
for a moment,

29
00:03:16,166 --> 00:03:17,583
--you ambling monument to filth.

30
00:03:17,666 --> 00:03:19,208
--[SHIDO] Miku. Listen up!
--you ambling monument to filth.

31
00:03:19,291 --> 00:03:21,333
I have to go save Tohka.

32
00:03:21,416 --> 00:03:22,541
She was kidnapped by the people

33
00:03:22,625 --> 00:03:24,375
you should actually
be worried about.

34
00:03:24,458 --> 00:03:26,583
--Understand?
--I thought I just told you.

35
00:03:26,666 --> 00:03:28,833
Shut your mouth!

36
00:03:28,916 --> 00:03:31,500
Gabriel... March!

37
00:03:35,083 --> 00:03:36,375
They're starting to wake up!

38
00:03:36,458 --> 00:03:38,333
Well, color me impressed.

39
00:03:38,416 --> 00:03:40,791
I didn't think ordinary
humans would be able to move

40
00:03:40,875 --> 00:03:42,666
while under the
effects of my shadow.

41
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:43,916
Of course they can.

42
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,083
The power of Gabriel
makes people adore me,

43
00:03:46,166 --> 00:03:48,958
then shapes their will to
match my own wants and desires!

44
00:03:49,041 --> 00:03:50,541
Your shadow is too weak...

45
00:03:50,625 --> 00:03:53,416
And now, I'm not going to
tell them to just capture you.

46
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,458
No, quite the contrary!

47
00:03:55,541 --> 00:03:57,708
Come along, my darlings!

48
00:03:57,791 --> 00:03:58,833
Go forth.

49
00:03:58,916 --> 00:04:01,416
And that means rip
that man to shreds!

50
00:04:02,875 --> 00:04:04,541
Stop! You're making me laugh.

51
00:04:04,625 --> 00:04:07,416
It seems a tad premature
to pat yourself on the back.

52
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:08,541
You'll have to
do better than that

53
00:04:08,625 --> 00:04:10,958
if you expect
to beat me, got it?

54
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:13,416
Careful!

55
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,291
I haven't killed anyone yet.

56
00:04:15,375 --> 00:04:17,291
Stop worrying so much.

57
00:04:17,375 --> 00:04:20,500
--[KAGUYA] Raphael, El Re'em!
--[YUZURU] Raphael, El Nahash!

58
00:04:20,583 --> 00:04:22,125
[KAGUYA, YUZURU yelling]

59
00:04:25,625 --> 00:04:27,500
Thanks. Helluva catch!

60
00:04:27,583 --> 00:04:28,583
No problem.

61
00:04:28,666 --> 00:04:31,333
You can reward me
when this is over.

62
00:04:31,416 --> 00:04:33,666
Kaguya! Yuzuru!

63
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:36,250
I'm starting to find
your persistence annoying!

64
00:04:36,333 --> 00:04:38,250
I will not take it easy
on anyone who intends

65
00:04:38,333 --> 00:04:41,083
to harm our Mistress,
no matter who they might be!

66
00:04:41,166 --> 00:04:42,500
Admonishment.

67
00:04:42,583 --> 00:04:44,708
Continue defying us, and
I will be left with no choice

68
00:04:44,791 --> 00:04:46,000
but to eliminate you.

69
00:04:46,083 --> 00:04:48,708
[ghastly laughter]

70
00:04:50,416 --> 00:04:51,750
[YOSHINO]
I'm really sorry, but...

71
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:54,250
I won't let you
lay a finger on her!

72
00:04:54,333 --> 00:04:55,500
Yoshino...

73
00:04:58,625 --> 00:05:00,625
You have got to be joking!

74
00:05:00,708 --> 00:05:01,958
Don't expect an attack like that

75
00:05:02,041 --> 00:05:04,166
to work against
hurricane children!

76
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:07,708
I call forth... Zaphkiel!

77
00:05:07,791 --> 00:05:09,208
[KURUMI] Now then, Shido...

78
00:05:09,291 --> 00:05:12,000
I think that you and Miku
should have some alone time.

79
00:05:12,083 --> 00:05:14,083
And whatever you do,
make sure you convince her

80
00:05:14,166 --> 00:05:17,750
to keep out of our way
when we rescue Tohka.

81
00:05:17,833 --> 00:05:20,083
[KURUMI] Zaphkiel... Aleph.

82
00:05:21,958 --> 00:05:23,666
Well then,
I'll leave it to you.

83
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:24,750
Good luck, Me.

84
00:05:24,833 --> 00:05:25,916
Thanks.

85
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,625
I'm not gonna let
either of us down, Me.

86
00:05:27,708 --> 00:05:28,833
[gunshot]

87
00:05:28,916 --> 00:05:29,958
[KAGUYA] No way!

88
00:05:31,833 --> 00:05:33,708
[YOSHINON]
What is your deal, weirdo?

89
00:05:39,666 --> 00:05:41,416
No, don't let her sing!

90
00:05:45,708 --> 00:05:47,708
Wait...
What are you doing?

91
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:53,666
I've kept the promise I
made to you, Shido, my sweet.

92
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:56,750
Now all you need to do is figure
out a way to change her mind.

93
00:05:56,833 --> 00:05:58,250
You kids have fun!

94
00:05:58,333 --> 00:06:00,958
[KURUMI giggling]

95
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,041
[MIKU] I have nothing
to discuss, do you hear me?

96
00:06:04,125 --> 00:06:05,958
And what is it with
this strange place?

97
00:06:06,041 --> 00:06:08,875
Something gets in the way every
time I try to use my powers!

98
00:06:08,958 --> 00:06:10,083
Then to top it all off,

99
00:06:10,166 --> 00:06:12,375
I'm stuck here with
an icky plebe like you!

100
00:06:12,458 --> 00:06:14,666
I'm really sorry
about tricking you, Miku...

101
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:17,583
But those other people didn't
have anything to do with this!

102
00:06:17,666 --> 00:06:18,958
Please, let them go, you don't--

103
00:06:19,041 --> 00:06:20,250
Shut your mouth!

104
00:06:20,333 --> 00:06:22,500
Just be quiet!
Not a single word!

105
00:06:22,583 --> 00:06:24,541
The last thing I want is
to talk to a creep like you

106
00:06:24,625 --> 00:06:26,750
after you humiliated me!

107
00:06:26,833 --> 00:06:28,500
[SHIDO]
Fine. You can stay mad at me.

108
00:06:28,583 --> 00:06:30,208
Just listen...

109
00:06:30,291 --> 00:06:31,458
Do you remember Tohka?

110
00:06:31,541 --> 00:06:34,000
The girl who was singing
on stage with my band?

111
00:06:34,083 --> 00:06:36,875
She's a Spirit, too,
as I'm sure you've noticed.

112
00:06:36,958 --> 00:06:39,000
During the uproar in the arena,

113
00:06:39,083 --> 00:06:42,083
she was kidnapped
by a DEM wizard.

114
00:06:42,166 --> 00:06:44,833
I'm going to do
everything I can to save her.

115
00:06:44,916 --> 00:06:48,125
And I brought you here
to ask for your help.

116
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:49,541
[MIKU] What?

117
00:06:49,625 --> 00:06:51,250
[SHIDO] Even with Kurumi's
powers added into the mix,

118
00:06:51,333 --> 00:06:53,750
it still might not be
enough to get Tohka back!

119
00:06:53,833 --> 00:06:55,041
But if you were to join us,

120
00:06:55,125 --> 00:06:57,666
it could be the extra
push we need to win!

121
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,000
I refuse!

122
00:06:59,083 --> 00:07:00,916
Why would I do such a thing
for a jerk like you?

123
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:01,750
[SHIDO] Please!

124
00:07:01,833 --> 00:07:02,958
[MIKU] I'm tired of this!

125
00:07:03,041 --> 00:07:05,291
I no longer wish to
listen to your nonsense!

126
00:07:05,375 --> 00:07:06,666
To your lies!

127
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:08,208
I know you have
an ulterior motive,

128
00:07:08,291 --> 00:07:09,833
because human beings
are selfish.

129
00:07:09,916 --> 00:07:12,000
None of you are capable
of caring about someone

130
00:07:12,083 --> 00:07:13,583
the way you claim to!

131
00:07:15,125 --> 00:07:17,416
Why do you hate
humans so intensely, Miku?

132
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,041
Even you were one--

133
00:07:19,125 --> 00:07:21,791
[KURUMI] Sorry to interrupt in
the middle of your little chat,

134
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:23,708
but we're about to
reach the time limit!

135
00:07:23,791 --> 00:07:24,750
[SHIDO] No, wait!

136
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:31,708
Mistress, you're back!

137
00:07:32,875 --> 00:07:33,916
Are you all right?

138
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Relief.
We were worried about you.

139
00:07:37,166 --> 00:07:38,416
[KURUMI] Come on, Shido.

140
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,041
Up on your feet, my dear...

141
00:07:40,125 --> 00:07:43,458
My power over Time unfortunately
has finite limits.

142
00:07:43,541 --> 00:07:45,791
Retreating would be a good idea.

143
00:07:45,875 --> 00:07:47,041
No, not yet, Kurumi!

144
00:07:47,125 --> 00:07:48,500
I was getting so close--

145
00:07:50,208 --> 00:07:51,708
You threaten my Mistress...

146
00:07:51,791 --> 00:07:53,333
I won't stand for it!

147
00:07:53,416 --> 00:07:54,416
But Yoshino...

148
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,875
Are you starting
to see the situation?

149
00:07:56,958 --> 00:07:59,083
Zaphkiel. Aleph.

150
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:03,208
[SHIDO] Sorry, Kurumi.

151
00:08:03,291 --> 00:08:06,375
I didn't change her mind at all.
I just made her mad instead.

152
00:08:06,458 --> 00:08:08,583
And after you did
so much to help me...

153
00:08:10,333 --> 00:08:12,333
[KURUMI] The last thing I ever
thought I'd hear from you

154
00:08:12,416 --> 00:08:13,750
are words of gratitude.

155
00:08:13,833 --> 00:08:15,625
It actually made me happy.

156
00:08:15,708 --> 00:08:18,416
Now pat my head
in a manner of approval.

157
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:22,291
[KURUMI]
Anyway, from everything I saw,

158
00:08:22,375 --> 00:08:25,000
she doesn't seem like the type
who would put herself in danger

159
00:08:25,083 --> 00:08:26,500
just to try and stop us.

160
00:08:26,583 --> 00:08:27,916
And more importantly,

161
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,416
I gave her a sample platter
of some of my abilities.

162
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,375
[SHIDO]
Yeah. I guess you're right.

163
00:08:32,458 --> 00:08:34,208
There is one thing...

164
00:08:34,291 --> 00:08:35,333
What's that?

165
00:08:35,416 --> 00:08:37,250
You were asking Miku
to join your side

166
00:08:37,333 --> 00:08:38,916
while you were in
the shadow, weren't you?

167
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,458
So, are you trying to insinuate

168
00:08:40,541 --> 00:08:42,833
that my help isn't
going to be enough for you?

169
00:08:42,916 --> 00:08:45,750
That... wasn't my intention--

170
00:08:45,833 --> 00:08:47,458
I was just teasing you.

171
00:08:47,541 --> 00:08:50,625
We don't know how powerful the
enemy we're about to face is.

172
00:08:50,708 --> 00:08:52,333
You made the right
decision when you tried

173
00:08:52,416 --> 00:08:55,708
to increase the power of our
assault force, my handsome hero.

174
00:08:55,791 --> 00:08:56,708
Thank you...

175
00:08:56,791 --> 00:08:58,083
But that said...

176
00:08:58,166 --> 00:09:00,666
Never, ever try to
lie to me, sweetheart.

177
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:02,250
You're not very good at it.

178
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:03,625
Okay.

179
00:09:04,708 --> 00:09:06,041
[KURUMI] Oh, that's right...

180
00:09:06,125 --> 00:09:08,666
I have some more news for you:

181
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:10,375
I have tracked down Tohka.

182
00:09:10,458 --> 00:09:12,875
What? Really? Where is she?

183
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:14,958
[giggling]

184
00:09:15,041 --> 00:09:16,500
DEM.

185
00:09:16,583 --> 00:09:18,875
Deus Ex Machina Industries,

186
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:21,250
in Building One
of their Japan branch.

187
00:09:23,083 --> 00:09:24,500
[WESTCOTT] I'm excited
to finally meet you

188
00:09:24,583 --> 00:09:26,291
in person, Princess.

189
00:09:26,375 --> 00:09:28,958
Or should I say
Tohka Yatogami instead?

190
00:09:29,041 --> 00:09:32,916
I'm Isaac Westcott, the Managing
Director of DEM Industries.

191
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,375
[growling]

192
00:09:35,458 --> 00:09:37,166
I wonder why she
doesn't like me?

193
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:38,958
You probably should
have taken your approach

194
00:09:39,041 --> 00:09:41,625
into consideration
if you wanted her approval.

195
00:09:41,708 --> 00:09:43,291
[TOHKA]
Are you the one behind this?

196
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:45,125
What is it you
people want from me?

197
00:09:45,208 --> 00:09:46,041
[WESTCOTT] Good question!

198
00:09:46,125 --> 00:09:47,625
It's actually rather simple.

199
00:09:47,708 --> 00:09:50,416
I want to harness the
powers you have as a Spirit.

200
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:53,166
I'm planning to unleash them
to create total chaos.

201
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:54,583
Chaos? You can't!

202
00:09:54,666 --> 00:09:56,333
Unfortunately, your
presence in this world

203
00:09:56,416 --> 00:09:58,500
is far too stable
at the moment.

204
00:09:58,583 --> 00:09:59,916
I'll have to find
the perfect trigger

205
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,791
to push you
towards despair.

206
00:10:01,875 --> 00:10:03,333
[TOHKA] What do you mean?

207
00:10:03,416 --> 00:10:04,916
[WESTCOTT]
What do you think, Ellen?

208
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,791
Physical pain is probably the
fastest way, wouldn't you agree?

209
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:10,041
Electric shock...

210
00:10:10,125 --> 00:10:11,541
Oxygen deprivation...

211
00:10:11,625 --> 00:10:13,500
Pulling her toenails
off might work...

212
00:10:13,583 --> 00:10:16,125
We could always
file your teeth down.

213
00:10:16,208 --> 00:10:17,625
Don't even get me
started when it comes to

214
00:10:17,708 --> 00:10:20,541
completely destroying
your dignity as a woman!

215
00:10:20,625 --> 00:10:22,250
Do you have any friends
or lovers out there

216
00:10:22,333 --> 00:10:23,500
in the real world?

217
00:10:23,583 --> 00:10:24,958
I wonder how
you'd feel if we killed

218
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:27,583
someone close to you right
in front of your eyes?

219
00:10:32,625 --> 00:10:33,625
Who's out there?

220
00:10:33,708 --> 00:10:34,958
[ELLEN]
The person she feels closest to

221
00:10:35,041 --> 00:10:37,875
is most likely Shido Itsuka,
whom I mentioned.

222
00:10:37,958 --> 00:10:39,541
During my initial interrogation,

223
00:10:39,625 --> 00:10:41,541
her biometric readings
practically went

224
00:10:41,625 --> 00:10:43,750
through the roof when
I mentioned his name.

225
00:10:43,833 --> 00:10:45,041
[WESTCOTT] Very good.

226
00:10:45,125 --> 00:10:46,958
Then we'll wait for him
before we continue.

227
00:10:47,041 --> 00:10:48,166
You scum!

228
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:50,208
If you hurt one hair
on Shido's head, I'll--

229
00:10:52,125 --> 00:10:54,375
Struggling will
only make it worse.

230
00:10:54,458 --> 00:10:56,375
No... Shido!

231
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,625
[KURUMI] Every one of the
buildings in front of us

232
00:11:03,708 --> 00:11:05,541
belongs to DEM.

233
00:11:05,625 --> 00:11:08,208
Building One is the tall
skyscraper in the middle.

234
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,916
Unfortunately,
I'm not able to determine

235
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,166
exactly which part
of the building she's in.

236
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:16,041
As long as you're
sure that she's in there...

237
00:11:16,125 --> 00:11:18,333
Shall we go over the
plan one more time, then?

238
00:11:18,416 --> 00:11:19,708
First course of action:

239
00:11:19,791 --> 00:11:22,041
You and I make our way
to the target building.

240
00:11:22,125 --> 00:11:24,416
Then I call in the other mes
to create a distraction

241
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,666
by attacking the
outlying facilities.

242
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:29,000
[SHIDO] Which will help disperse
the enemy's attack power,

243
00:11:29,083 --> 00:11:31,791
and lessen the guard
on Tohka at the same time,

244
00:11:31,875 --> 00:11:33,083
theoretically.

245
00:11:33,166 --> 00:11:34,791
Don't worry.
It will work like a charm.

246
00:11:34,875 --> 00:11:35,750
The spatial quake alarm!

247
00:11:35,833 --> 00:11:41,250
[alarm sounding]

248
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:42,708
Why now of all times?

249
00:11:42,791 --> 00:11:44,291
Is there another
Spirit out here?

250
00:11:44,375 --> 00:11:46,750
[KURUMI] That doesn't seem to
be the case this time around...

251
00:11:46,833 --> 00:11:49,291
I wouldn't be at all
surprised if DEM themselves

252
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,500
set off the alarm.

253
00:11:50,583 --> 00:11:52,416
And if that's true...

254
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,208
...it's a good bet
they're trying to minimize

255
00:11:56,291 --> 00:11:59,541
the number of eyewitnesses
to their orgy of violence!

256
00:12:03,208 --> 00:12:04,875
[SHIDO] Bandersnatch!

257
00:12:11,083 --> 00:12:12,791
Come out and play, girls!

258
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:25,208
[ghastly laughter]

259
00:12:28,791 --> 00:12:30,291
Whoa, that's amazing...

260
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:33,458
These are the hors d'oeuvres.
Just wait for the main course!

261
00:12:33,541 --> 00:12:34,958
[SHIDO] What?

262
00:12:35,041 --> 00:12:36,916
[KURUMI] Let's change the plan
up a bit, what do you say?

263
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,416
Why don't I sic the other mes
on the dolls and Wizards?

264
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:44,166
Then we'll waltz past, using
the cover created by the chaos.

265
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:47,291
Now then, Zaphkiel. Aleph!

266
00:12:50,375 --> 00:12:51,791
[SHIDO wheezing]

267
00:12:51,875 --> 00:12:54,041
[KURUMI] Are you going
to be all right, Shido?

268
00:12:54,125 --> 00:12:57,000
[SHIDO] Yeah.
Don't worry about me...

269
00:12:57,083 --> 00:12:58,375
We're running out of time.

270
00:12:58,458 --> 00:12:59,708
We should get moving!

271
00:12:59,791 --> 00:13:01,333
[KURUMI] Sure... fine.

272
00:13:01,416 --> 00:13:02,875
Whatever you say.

273
00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:04,875
[SHIDO] Mana?

274
00:13:06,125 --> 00:13:07,458
Brother!

275
00:13:10,083 --> 00:13:11,833
Another violent
welcome from you.

276
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:13,833
It's nice to see that
some things don't change.

277
00:13:13,916 --> 00:13:15,500
Don't shoot!

278
00:13:15,583 --> 00:13:17,916
[KURUMI] Did you actually
think a cheap shot like that

279
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,625
could finish off
the likes of me?

280
00:13:19,708 --> 00:13:21,791
No, but I saw the
chance and I took it.

281
00:13:21,875 --> 00:13:23,208
Maybe next time
I'll be lucky enough

282
00:13:23,291 --> 00:13:25,958
to permanently erase
that creepy smile of yours!

283
00:13:26,041 --> 00:13:27,208
[KURUMI] It's really adorable

284
00:13:27,291 --> 00:13:29,583
when you get all
worked up like that.

285
00:13:29,666 --> 00:13:31,250
Maybe you're just
too dumb to remember

286
00:13:31,333 --> 00:13:32,500
how badly I beat you.

287
00:13:32,583 --> 00:13:34,208
Or did the terror
of our last encounter

288
00:13:34,291 --> 00:13:36,208
make you suffer
hysterical amnesia?

289
00:13:36,291 --> 00:13:38,083
[SHIDO] We really
don't have time for this.

290
00:13:39,583 --> 00:13:42,125
Actually, this works
out perfectly for me.

291
00:13:42,208 --> 00:13:43,708
There's an entirely
different matter

292
00:13:43,791 --> 00:13:46,000
I'd like to settle
with DEM before we go,

293
00:13:46,083 --> 00:13:48,166
so we should split up
for the time being.

294
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:50,541
You should be fine with
Mana keeping an eye on you.

295
00:13:50,625 --> 00:13:52,000
What about our strategy?

296
00:13:52,083 --> 00:13:53,791
[KURUMI] Don't worry
your little head about it.

297
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:58,000
My doppelgangers will continue
creating a diversion for you.

298
00:13:58,083 --> 00:14:00,583
Bye-bye, Shido!
I'll see you later!

299
00:14:00,666 --> 00:14:02,791
[SHIDO] Kurumi! Wait!

300
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:05,041
Uh, I don't know
what kind of arrangement

301
00:14:05,125 --> 00:14:06,500
you had with that girl...

302
00:14:06,583 --> 00:14:07,958
But her leaving's for the best.

303
00:14:08,041 --> 00:14:09,666
[SHIDO] C'mon, Mana,
she's not that bad.

304
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:11,083
I almost forgot!

305
00:14:11,166 --> 00:14:13,458
Here. Take it.

306
00:14:13,541 --> 00:14:15,041
[KOTORI]
Shido, can you hear me?

307
00:14:15,125 --> 00:14:17,500
[SHIDO] Kotori?
Are you back to normal now?

308
00:14:17,583 --> 00:14:20,166
[KOTORI] Yes. Fortunately.

309
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:22,083
I want to apologize.

310
00:14:22,166 --> 00:14:26,416
Apparently, I told you to die
and some other mean stuff.

311
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,375
But I didn't mean any of it.

312
00:14:28,458 --> 00:14:30,250
[SHIDO] Yeah, I knew that.

313
00:14:30,333 --> 00:14:32,583
Forget about it, okay?

314
00:14:32,666 --> 00:14:33,791
[MIKU] Come on!

315
00:14:33,875 --> 00:14:36,166
This is starting to
become really annoying!

316
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:37,500
What are you, simple?

317
00:14:37,583 --> 00:14:38,916
There's no way a mere human,

318
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,791
especially a filthy,
stinking male,

319
00:14:40,875 --> 00:14:44,250
could ever hold anything more
dearly than his own stupid life!

320
00:14:46,208 --> 00:14:48,208
[MIKU] It isn't possible!

321
00:14:48,291 --> 00:14:50,000
But if it is true, then I...

322
00:14:50,083 --> 00:14:51,708
What's wrong, Mistress?

323
00:14:54,833 --> 00:14:56,916
Say... My dears...

324
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,958
I want you to give me a concise,
honest answer, all right?

325
00:15:00,041 --> 00:15:03,000
What do you know about Tohka
and Shido's relationship?

326
00:15:03,083 --> 00:15:04,916
Do you think he was
telling me the truth?

327
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,041
Is she really that
precious to him?

328
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:10,583
No. That dude is
like way superficial!

329
00:15:10,666 --> 00:15:12,000
I bet that he's all talk.

330
00:15:12,083 --> 00:15:13,875
Ugh. That is so lame!

331
00:15:14,875 --> 00:15:19,083
[MIKU] I thought I told you
girls to answer me honestly.

332
00:15:19,166 --> 00:15:22,458
I hate girls who tell lies.

333
00:15:22,541 --> 00:15:24,375
So like If I'm
being perfectly honest,

334
00:15:24,458 --> 00:15:26,750
I don't know what kind
of relationship they have.

335
00:15:26,833 --> 00:15:29,125
They aren't dating, but I think
they're more than just friends.

336
00:15:29,208 --> 00:15:31,583
I've seen them spend a
lot of time together, and...

337
00:15:31,666 --> 00:15:34,000
And when Tohka's with him,
she seems really happy.

338
00:15:34,083 --> 00:15:36,833
Even though he's a total dork,
I think he cares for her a lot.

339
00:15:36,916 --> 00:15:38,541
It seems true, Mistress.

340
00:15:38,625 --> 00:15:40,791
That's so lame.
That's so lame.

341
00:15:40,875 --> 00:15:42,583
Then, if the
situation got desperate,

342
00:15:42,666 --> 00:15:45,916
and he had to sacrifice
himself in order to save Tohka,

343
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,916
what do you think
Shido would do?

344
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,875
Shido would never give up.

345
00:15:49,958 --> 00:15:52,000
He wouldn't hesitate
for a moment.

346
00:15:52,083 --> 00:15:55,416
I know he'd do whatever
it took to save Tohka.

347
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:57,791
Yoshino's right,
and he'd pull it off, too.

348
00:15:57,875 --> 00:15:59,708
That idiot would stare
death square in the face

349
00:15:59,791 --> 00:16:01,958
without thinking of
himself for a second.

350
00:16:02,041 --> 00:16:04,208
He did it before,
when he saved me and Yuzuru.

351
00:16:04,291 --> 00:16:05,416
Agreement.

352
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:06,625
There must be
something wrong with him.

353
00:16:06,708 --> 00:16:08,625
I'm certain he would
do anything for Tohka,

354
00:16:08,708 --> 00:16:11,500
no matter what he might
be forced to sacrifice.

355
00:16:13,416 --> 00:16:14,583
I will bring Tohka back,

356
00:16:14,666 --> 00:16:17,125
no matter what happens,
or what I have to do!

357
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:24,791
[KOTORI] No way.
I won't accept it.

358
00:16:24,875 --> 00:16:26,083
[SHIDO]
What are you talking about?

359
00:16:26,166 --> 00:16:27,708
Tohka's been kidnapped!

360
00:16:27,791 --> 00:16:30,500
And you told me that DEM
was a dangerous organization

361
00:16:30,583 --> 00:16:32,416
trying to kill off all Spirits!

362
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:35,250
[KOTORI] Exactly!
They're extremely dangerous!

363
00:16:35,333 --> 00:16:37,375
Excuse me for trying
to keep my moron brother

364
00:16:37,458 --> 00:16:39,791
from infiltrating
a freaking lion's den!

365
00:16:39,875 --> 00:16:41,875
And by the way, your life
is just as important

366
00:16:41,958 --> 00:16:43,750
as the people you're protecting!

367
00:16:43,833 --> 00:16:45,750
[SHIDO] Are you suggesting
I just leave Tohka?

368
00:16:45,833 --> 00:16:47,416
[KOTORI] We need time
to properly prepare!

369
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:48,958
[SHIDO] That'll take too long!

370
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:51,666
Kurumi is out there stalling
the Wizards for us right now.

371
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:53,500
We won't have another
chance like this.

372
00:16:53,583 --> 00:16:54,458
Trust me!

373
00:16:54,541 --> 00:16:55,625
I know I can save her.

374
00:16:55,708 --> 00:16:58,375
I just need more time! Please!

375
00:16:58,458 --> 00:17:00,125
[KOTORI] All right, fine!

376
00:17:00,208 --> 00:17:03,083
Not like you'd listen if
I tried to stop you, anyway.

377
00:17:03,166 --> 00:17:05,833
Thanks. I suppose
you know me too well, Kotori.

378
00:17:07,083 --> 00:17:08,375
I should hope so.

379
00:17:08,458 --> 00:17:10,958
I've been your sister
for over a decade now, jerk.

380
00:17:11,041 --> 00:17:12,833
After you've made it
inside the building,

381
00:17:12,916 --> 00:17:15,375
they'll most likely
jam all communications.

382
00:17:15,458 --> 00:17:16,708
The only thing
the Fraxinus can do

383
00:17:16,791 --> 00:17:18,458
is provide support
on the outside.

384
00:17:18,541 --> 00:17:20,416
That will be more than enough.

385
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:21,500
Thanks, Kotori.

386
00:17:21,583 --> 00:17:22,791
[KOTORI] Seriously...

387
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:24,166
The things we little
sisters have to deal with

388
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:26,125
because of big brothers
who never listen!

389
00:17:26,208 --> 00:17:27,250
Right, Mana?

390
00:17:27,333 --> 00:17:28,791
But to be fair,

391
00:17:28,875 --> 00:17:30,291
I would also never accept
having a weakling big brother

392
00:17:30,375 --> 00:17:32,041
who could turn tail and run.

393
00:17:32,125 --> 00:17:33,291
That's pathetic.

394
00:17:33,375 --> 00:17:34,583
[KOTORI] If you're going
to go through with it,

395
00:17:34,666 --> 00:17:36,666
I won't allow you
to half-ass it.

396
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:39,083
I won't consider it a
success until Tohka is saved

397
00:17:39,166 --> 00:17:42,250
and you and Mana are
back on board the Fraxinus.

398
00:17:42,333 --> 00:17:43,833
Deal.

399
00:17:43,916 --> 00:17:44,666
[KOTORI] Now...

400
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:46,583
[KOTORI, SHIDO]
It's time.

401
00:17:46,666 --> 00:17:48,625
[KOTORI, SHIDO]
Let's begin our date!

402
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:54,083
No, Origami,
you can't, please stop!

403
00:17:54,166 --> 00:17:55,500
[ORIGAMI] Let me go.

404
00:17:55,583 --> 00:17:57,666
If Shido is on the battlefield,
then I must help him.

405
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:59,041
That's impossible!

406
00:17:59,125 --> 00:18:01,625
Don't you know that your ID
has been totally frozen?

407
00:18:01,708 --> 00:18:03,625
You aren't even allowed
to use the wiring suits,

408
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:05,708
much less the CR units!

409
00:18:05,791 --> 00:18:08,083
Then I'll just have to
use conventional armament.

410
00:18:08,166 --> 00:18:11,083
I should be able to find a rifle
somewhere on the base.

411
00:18:11,166 --> 00:18:12,333
Are you crazy?

412
00:18:12,416 --> 00:18:14,333
You think you can enter
a battlefield of Wizards

413
00:18:14,416 --> 00:18:16,458
and Spirits without
your own Territory?

414
00:18:16,541 --> 00:18:18,166
And on top of all that...

415
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:21,791
Shido is Nightmare's accomplice
in attacking D.E.M Industries.

416
00:18:21,875 --> 00:18:24,041
He's become the AST's enemy.

417
00:18:24,125 --> 00:18:25,375
[ORIGAMI] Don't you understand?

418
00:18:25,458 --> 00:18:27,083
That's exactly why
I have to go.

419
00:18:27,166 --> 00:18:28,875
I've lost everything
else in my life.

420
00:18:28,958 --> 00:18:31,083
He's the only thing
I can rely on now.

421
00:18:31,166 --> 00:18:33,041
If he dies,
so will part of me.

422
00:18:33,125 --> 00:18:35,541
I'll no longer
be myself anymore.

423
00:18:35,625 --> 00:18:37,083
You have to let me go.

424
00:18:37,166 --> 00:18:38,916
What if I told you
I would commit suicide

425
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,666
if you left this building?

426
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:43,958
I'm confident you would
never do such a thing.

427
00:18:44,041 --> 00:18:46,791
I know you know how sad
I would be if you did.

428
00:18:50,916 --> 00:18:53,000
But this isn't fair.

429
00:18:53,083 --> 00:18:54,916
I'm a little bit jealous of him.

430
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Because it seems as if you
would do anything for him.

431
00:18:59,083 --> 00:19:00,416
There is one thing...

432
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:02,125
I just thought of it...

433
00:19:02,208 --> 00:19:04,291
But I don't know if
you can use it or not.

434
00:19:10,375 --> 00:19:13,916
[ghastly laughter]

435
00:19:20,833 --> 00:19:22,250
[MANA] Time to move, brother.

436
00:19:22,333 --> 00:19:23,375
[SHIDO] All right.

437
00:19:23,458 --> 00:19:25,666
I guess now is as
good a time as any.

438
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:27,583
But with such a
large facility,

439
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:30,750
it would be nice to at least
know which floor Tohka is on.

440
00:19:30,833 --> 00:19:32,333
[REINE]
If they have Tohka confined,

441
00:19:32,416 --> 00:19:35,500
it is probably in their facility
to quarantine Spirits...

442
00:19:35,583 --> 00:19:37,625
Like the one
we have on Fraxinus.

443
00:19:43,625 --> 00:19:44,791
Are you okay?

444
00:19:44,875 --> 00:19:45,833
[MANA] Yeah, yeah.

445
00:19:45,916 --> 00:19:47,750
I'm fine, don't you worry.

446
00:19:50,708 --> 00:19:53,250
Wait, isn't that...

447
00:19:53,333 --> 00:19:54,750
...White Licorice?

448
00:19:54,833 --> 00:19:56,791
[MANA] You sure know
your hardware!

449
00:19:56,875 --> 00:19:58,958
But this one is a
little bit different.

450
00:19:59,041 --> 00:20:00,791
It's the sister unit
to White Licorice,

451
00:20:00,875 --> 00:20:02,750
which was made for testing.

452
00:20:02,833 --> 00:20:07,000
DW-zero-two-nine-R,
Scarlet Licorice!

453
00:20:12,166 --> 00:20:13,291
[SHIDO] Mana!

454
00:20:18,625 --> 00:20:20,166
[KOTORI]
Shido, it's too dangerous!

455
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:22,250
Don't move on your own.
Wait for Mana!

456
00:20:22,333 --> 00:20:24,666
[SHIDO] But their defense is
getting stronger every minute!

457
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:28,041
And if I'm outside,
I might get in Mana's way!

458
00:20:28,125 --> 00:20:30,125
[KOTORI]
That's actually a good point.

459
00:20:30,208 --> 00:20:31,833
Wait, Shido!

460
00:20:39,625 --> 00:20:40,625
There's an intruder!

461
00:20:40,708 --> 00:20:41,541
[MALE WIZARD 8A]
Halt, who goes there?

462
00:20:41,625 --> 00:20:43,958
Where did you come from?

463
00:20:44,041 --> 00:20:46,000
[MALE WIZARD 8A]
Stop! Stop or I'll shoot!

464
00:20:46,083 --> 00:20:47,666
[SHIDO]
You're already shooting!

465
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:53,000
[SHIDO] Damnit...

466
00:20:53,083 --> 00:20:55,625
I can't let it
end here like this!

467
00:20:55,708 --> 00:21:00,375
Tohka... Tohka... Tohka!

468
00:21:00,458 --> 00:21:02,458
I need you!

469
00:21:03,791 --> 00:21:04,833
[WIZARDS gasping]

470
00:21:09,625 --> 00:21:11,041
An Angel?

471
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:19,041
[SHIDO] Oh yeah. About time!

472
00:21:19,125 --> 00:21:22,666
Let's go and save
your master! Agreed?

473
00:21:26,875 --> 00:21:28,333
[TOHKA]
You summoned Sandalphon.

474
00:21:28,416 --> 00:21:31,083
You brought forth its power
with your desire, Shido.
