[NARRATOR] Spirits...

00:00:31,666 --> 00:00:33,791
How do we deal with
trans-spatial life forms

3
00:00:33,875 --> 00:00:35,750
that cause disasters?

4
00:00:35,833 --> 00:00:38,375
Strategy one: Destroy them
through overwhelming

5
00:00:38,458 --> 00:00:40,041
military force.

6
00:00:40,125 --> 00:00:44,041
Or strategy two: Date them
and make them fall in love.

[TOHKA] It's pretty simple,
Miss Okamine.

10
00:02:21,833 --> 00:02:24,333
Yes... I am totally a boy now...

11
00:02:24,416 --> 00:02:26,083
So I can stay in
the same room as Shido

12
00:02:26,166 --> 00:02:27,666
when we go on the school trip!

13
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:28,833
I don't think so.

14
00:02:28,916 --> 00:02:30,208
You can keep wearing
those clothes,

15
00:02:30,291 --> 00:02:31,791
but it doesn't change
the fact that boys and girls

16
00:02:31,875 --> 00:02:33,041
have to stay in separate rooms--

17
00:02:33,125 --> 00:02:34,375
Excuse me...

18
00:02:34,458 --> 00:02:37,458
I think you should approve
Tohka's unusual request.

19
00:02:37,541 --> 00:02:39,083
Or at least consider it.

--Huh?
--Huh?

00:02:40,708 --> 00:02:42,666
Hold on...
What are you after?

22
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:44,250
I really admire
that you have the courage

23
00:02:44,333 --> 00:02:46,041
to come out
in front of everyone.

24
00:02:46,125 --> 00:02:49,875
I think you deserve to stay
in the boy's room, no question.

25
00:02:49,958 --> 00:02:51,833
Look. I'm not saying thanks.

26
00:02:51,916 --> 00:02:53,125
None needed.

27
00:02:53,208 --> 00:02:55,500
Stop wasting time!
The issue is non-negotiable!

28
00:02:55,583 --> 00:02:57,875
But it is still pretty
uncommon for a girl

29
00:02:57,958 --> 00:02:59,416
to want to become a boy.

30
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:02,125
To keep things balanced,
we'll make Shido into a girl.

31
00:03:02,208 --> 00:03:04,333
That literally makes no sense.

32
00:03:04,416 --> 00:03:06,416
Then we could bathe together.
Tastefully.

33
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:07,875
How's that tasteful?

34
00:03:07,958 --> 00:03:09,166
Wait a sec!

35
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:11,166
If he becomes a girl,
he won't be able to stay

36
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:12,750
in the boys' room with me!

37
00:03:12,833 --> 00:03:15,250
You're a man now.
You need to stay strong.

38
00:03:15,333 --> 00:03:18,208
Then this must've been
part of your plan all along!

39
00:03:18,916 --> 00:03:20,625
You are both being ridiculous!

40
00:03:20,708 --> 00:03:22,333
Boys and girls will
be in separate rooms!

41
00:03:22,416 --> 00:03:24,333
And no more
gender swapping, got it?

42
00:03:24,416 --> 00:03:25,416
Um, well...

43
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:26,833
Putting room assignments aside,

44
00:03:26,916 --> 00:03:28,916
you can choose your seats
for the plane ride.

45
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,750
You can spend time
together there.

[BOTH growling]

[KOTORI] The location
for the school trip?

48
00:03:38,125 --> 00:03:40,208
Yeah, Shido told me about it.

49
00:03:40,291 --> 00:03:43,041
They were going to Okinawa,
but now it's Arubi Island.

50
00:03:43,125 --> 00:03:45,166
We're talking a
last minute change, here.

51
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:47,000
[REINE] It seems a
certain travel agency said

52
00:03:47,083 --> 00:03:50,291
they would cover all expenses
in order to get publicity shots.

53
00:03:50,375 --> 00:03:51,666
With all financial
burden lifted,

54
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:53,083
the school quickly agreed.

55
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:54,000
However...

56
00:03:54,083 --> 00:03:55,833
Sounds suspicious.

57
00:03:55,916 --> 00:03:58,416
Perhaps I'm reading
too much into it.

58
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,583
But the agency, Cross Travel?

59
00:04:00,666 --> 00:04:03,625
It's a subsidiary
of DEM Industries...

60

[TOHKA] This was your game
from the beginning, wasn't it?

00:04:06,125 --> 00:04:08,500
You tricked me into the seat
farthest from the window!

I won't be fooled again!

which seat you wanted.

The clouds look
just like a carpet!

Well if you like carpet,
I've got what you want!

The teacher introduced
her to us earlier.

She's the pro photographer

161
00:07:50,875 --> 00:07:53,375
giving a bunch of annoying
students the stink eye.

162
00:07:53,458 --> 00:07:55,875
Now which way
to the Records Office?

163
00:07:55,958 --> 00:07:57,625
[SHIDO, TOHKA yelling]

164
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:01,458
What's going on?

165
00:08:01,541 --> 00:08:03,875
This came to a head
way too quickly!

166
00:08:05,291 --> 00:08:07,291
Shido... Get down!

167
00:08:16,708 --> 00:08:19,291
[SHIDO] Tohka! Are you okay?

168
00:08:19,375 --> 00:08:20,791
Just my luck...

169
00:08:29,083 --> 00:08:31,458
A Spirit? Or the AST?

170
00:08:31,541 --> 00:08:34,083
But the spatial quake alarm
never sounded...

171
00:08:36,791 --> 00:08:38,375
[SHIDO yelling]

172
00:08:57,958 --> 00:09:00,666
[SHIDO] Spirits? Two of 'em?

173
00:09:03,666 --> 00:09:04,500
I can't believe you!

174
00:09:04,583 --> 00:09:05,458
Please choose me, darling!

175
00:09:05,541 --> 00:09:06,250
[MAN 2A]
It doesn't matter--

176
00:09:06,333 --> 00:09:07,583
[TWINS] Yes, it does!

177
00:09:08,666 --> 00:09:10,166
[KOTORI]
Well, I'll be going then...

178
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:13,500
This isn't exactly the best
timing for a meeting at HQ...

179
00:09:13,583 --> 00:09:16,041
But it's a rare chance for the
Rounds to meet up in person,

180
00:09:16,125 --> 00:09:18,041
so I'm expected
to make an appearance.

181
00:09:18,125 --> 00:09:19,041
[KANNAZUKI] Go.

182
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:19,916
You may leave it
to me, Commander.

183
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
[SHIIZAKI] Don't worry.

184
00:09:21,083 --> 00:09:22,666
You can trust us
to hold down the fort.

185
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:24,041
[NAKATSUGAWA] Just promise
that you'll hurry back

186
00:09:24,125 --> 00:09:25,125
when you're done.

187
00:09:25,208 --> 00:09:26,875
But lo, the unbridled
passion of youth

188
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:28,541
set free during a school trip...

189
00:09:28,625 --> 00:09:29,958
And I, Kyohei Kannazuki,

190
00:09:30,041 --> 00:09:32,000
will chronicle this page
of Shido's salad days

191
00:09:32,083 --> 00:09:34,166
with every juicy detail
during your absence!

192
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:37,083
Right. I reiterate.
Please hurry back.

193
00:09:37,166 --> 00:09:38,875
Sure. I'll try.

194
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:43,958
Okay!

195
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:45,750
As acting commander
of the mighty Fraxinus...

196
00:09:45,833 --> 00:09:49,000
Plot a course for fifteen
thousand feet above the island!

197
00:09:55,125 --> 00:09:56,125
[laughing]

198
00:09:56,208 --> 00:09:57,708
Not too bad, Yuzuru...

199
00:09:57,791 --> 00:10:00,000
Although, I expected
as much from my other half.

200
00:10:00,083 --> 00:10:01,791
Too bad it will
all have been in vain!

201
00:10:01,875 --> 00:10:03,208
Rebuttal.

202
00:10:03,291 --> 00:10:04,375
Much has been learned
from our ninety-nine battles.

203
00:10:04,458 --> 00:10:06,416
The advantage is clearly mine.

204
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:07,625
Such sad prattle.

205
00:10:07,708 --> 00:10:09,583
We both know the only
Spirit even suitable

206
00:10:09,666 --> 00:10:12,041
to be Yamai's
successor is me.

207
00:10:12,125 --> 00:10:14,583
Negative. I am the one
who will persevere.

208
00:10:14,666 --> 00:10:17,000
The name Yamai does not fit
one as lowly as you.

209
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:18,291
Your words are hollow.

210
00:10:18,375 --> 00:10:20,166
My future devil sight
has already shown me

211
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:21,375
the inevitable end.

212
00:10:21,458 --> 00:10:23,083
It gave me a
vision of you, Yuzuru,

213
00:10:23,166 --> 00:10:25,875
impaled and dying on
the end of my Sturm Lanze!

214
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:27,375
Refute.

215
00:10:27,458 --> 00:10:30,041
Your devil sight has never
been accurate in the slightest.

216
00:10:30,125 --> 00:10:31,875
Shut up!
It has so worked before!

217
00:10:31,958 --> 00:10:33,541
And don't you dare
make fun of me!

218
00:10:33,625 --> 00:10:35,666
[REINE]
Shin... Can you hear me?

219
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:36,583
Reine?

220
00:10:36,666 --> 00:10:38,875
Good. I finally got through.

221
00:10:38,958 --> 00:10:40,958
Where are you
and Tohka currently?

222
00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:42,458
Umm... Not sure.

223
00:10:42,541 --> 00:10:43,500
[YUZURU] Request.

224
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:44,708
Kaguya, please
provide information

225
00:10:44,791 --> 00:10:46,208
regarding the
combat capabilities

226
00:10:46,291 --> 00:10:47,500
of your Sturm Lanze.

227
00:10:47,583 --> 00:10:49,958
[KAGUYA] Ha! The very font
of language dries up

228
00:10:50,041 --> 00:10:52,458
trying to describe the
scope of its awesome power.

229
00:10:52,541 --> 00:10:55,291
Tangible yet intangible.
Visible yet unseen.

230
00:10:55,375 --> 00:10:58,083
Only able to sate its thirst
with stabbing and piercing.

231
00:10:58,166 --> 00:10:59,166
Summary.

232
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:00,916
Just like you,
it is devoid of meaning.

233
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,958
That's not true!
It does have meaning!

234
00:11:03,041 --> 00:11:05,333
Maybe you're just too stupid
to really understand!

235
00:11:05,416 --> 00:11:06,333
Derisive.

236
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:08,791
Your Sturm Lanze
is laughable. Ha!

237
00:11:08,875 --> 00:11:09,875
How dare you!

238
00:11:09,958 --> 00:11:11,291
To punish you
for such insolence,

239
00:11:11,375 --> 00:11:13,375
perhaps I should rip
that smirk off your face

240
00:11:13,458 --> 00:11:14,916
right here and now!

241
00:11:17,958 --> 00:11:19,625
[SHIDO] We're gonna
get caught in the middle!

242
00:11:19,708 --> 00:11:21,500
Sink into darkness!!

243
00:11:21,583 --> 00:11:23,666
Retort... Hi-ya!

244
00:11:24,791 --> 00:11:27,000
Stop it!

245
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:33,333
Wait. Is that a human?

246
00:11:33,416 --> 00:11:36,333
Wondrous.
I cannot suppress my surprise.

247
00:11:36,416 --> 00:11:38,125
Uh... Hi?

248
00:11:38,208 --> 00:11:39,458
Why have you
brought our sacred duel

249
00:11:39,541 --> 00:11:40,833
to a standstill, human?

250
00:11:40,916 --> 00:11:42,500
And what are
your intentions for us?

251
00:11:42,583 --> 00:11:44,541
Depending on your answer...

252
00:11:44,625 --> 00:11:45,958
I'll, uh...

253
00:11:46,041 --> 00:11:48,666
...turn your body into a jelly
with my Schatten Lanze.

254
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:49,833
[YUZURU] Discrepancy...

255
00:11:49,916 --> 00:11:51,291
Your weapon's name
has changed completely.

256
00:11:51,375 --> 00:11:53,791
Unimportant!
Now be quiet, already!

257
00:11:53,875 --> 00:11:54,875
[YUZURU] Query.

258
00:11:54,958 --> 00:11:56,208
Since you are the one
who is confused,

259
00:11:56,291 --> 00:11:58,000
why must I be quiet?

260
00:11:59,583 --> 00:12:01,833
[KAGUYA] At this rate,
we won't resolve anything.

261
00:12:01,916 --> 00:12:03,166
Unless...

262
00:12:06,208 --> 00:12:09,583
I think I know how we
can settle things. For good.

263
00:12:09,666 --> 00:12:11,958
Question.
What did you have in mind?

264
00:12:12,041 --> 00:12:13,000
A new trial.

265
00:12:13,083 --> 00:12:14,625
We've had many contests,
haven't we?

266
00:12:14,708 --> 00:12:16,333
We've each had
twenty-five victories,

267
00:12:16,416 --> 00:12:18,125
and come to a draw
forty-nine times.

268
00:12:18,208 --> 00:12:21,083
The list of events to compete
in is rapidly dwindling.

269
00:12:21,166 --> 00:12:23,208
However, there is
still one competition

270
00:12:23,291 --> 00:12:25,416
which hasn't yet determined
a victor between us.

271
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:27,291
Doubtful... Explain.

272
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,291
Hey, uhh... We're back.

273
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,333
There's no denying...

274
00:12:44,416 --> 00:12:46,958
I'm obviously more lively
and charming than she is.

275
00:12:47,041 --> 00:12:49,666
Seduction.
I'm more fully developed.

276
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:51,916
What gives?

277
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,875
[REINE]
They're transfer students.

278
00:12:53,958 --> 00:12:56,000
[TAMAE]
This is highly unorthodox...

279
00:12:56,083 --> 00:12:58,041
The school never informed me
they were coming.

280
00:12:58,125 --> 00:13:00,083
[REINE] It was so sudden
they were probably worried

281
00:13:00,166 --> 00:13:02,166
that they couldn't
contact you in time.

282
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:05,000
Don't worry about the new girls.
Leave them to me, okay?

283
00:13:05,083 --> 00:13:07,125
Please focus your energy
on the other students.

284
00:13:07,208 --> 00:13:09,083
[TAMAE] Oh... Thank you.

285
00:13:09,166 --> 00:13:10,416
[KAGUYA] So Shido...

286
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:13,125
All you have to do is make
a simple little choice.

287
00:13:13,208 --> 00:13:15,541
Just say "Kaguya!
You drive me wild!

288
00:13:15,625 --> 00:13:18,291
Let me give myself to you,
body and soul forever."

289
00:13:18,375 --> 00:13:20,416
[YUZURU] Wrong...
Kaguya is a poor choice.

290
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,125
She is quite needy and childish.

291
00:13:22,208 --> 00:13:24,958
However, I would
strongly recommend me.

292
00:13:25,041 --> 00:13:27,500
Feeling a little
smothered, are we?

293
00:13:27,583 --> 00:13:29,125
Yeah...

294
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:31,583
[KAGUYA] Putting our
feminine wiles to the test...

295
00:13:31,666 --> 00:13:33,041
We haven't tried that yet.

296
00:13:33,125 --> 00:13:35,458
Surely the true heir
of the hurricane child Yamai

297
00:13:35,541 --> 00:13:37,000
would possess enough
grace and charm

298
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:39,458
to make all of creation
quake in jealousy!

299
00:13:39,541 --> 00:13:42,041
Reply. I believe
I follow your logic.

300
00:13:42,125 --> 00:13:43,708
In truth, it may be
the only attribute

301
00:13:43,791 --> 00:13:45,666
which we have not
put to a competition.

302
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:47,041
Yuzuru...

303
00:13:47,125 --> 00:13:49,208
Do you agree to pit our
beauty against one another?

304
00:13:49,291 --> 00:13:51,333
Of course,
my victory is certain.

305
00:13:51,416 --> 00:13:52,625
Negative.

306
00:13:52,708 --> 00:13:54,083
There is no chance
that you could ever beat me.

307
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:56,041
After all, I am the cutest.

308
00:13:56,125 --> 00:13:58,041
To be frank, your looks
are average at best.

309
00:13:58,125 --> 00:13:59,541
What do you mean by that?

310
00:13:59,625 --> 00:14:00,583
It doesn't matter.

311
00:14:00,666 --> 00:14:02,166
This will be
our decisive battle!

312
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:05,458
Whoever gets this man to fall in
love first will be the winner.

313
00:14:05,541 --> 00:14:07,708
Come on now, handsome.
Just spit it out.

314
00:14:07,791 --> 00:14:09,416
Which of us has
more feminine charm?

315
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:11,041
Me, or Little Miss Boring there?

316
00:14:11,125 --> 00:14:12,583
Question.

317
00:14:12,666 --> 00:14:15,333
Do you prefer a beautiful woman
or a cheap floozy like her?

318
00:14:15,416 --> 00:14:17,708
Look, I'm not a floozy.
You take that back right now!

319
00:14:17,791 --> 00:14:20,458
No. I am prettier
than that trollop, Kaguya.

320
00:14:20,541 --> 00:14:22,125
Stop! That's even worse!

321
00:14:22,208 --> 00:14:25,541
Would everyone shut up
for five seconds, please?

322
00:14:25,625 --> 00:14:27,375
Let me ask you
something first...

323
00:14:27,458 --> 00:14:29,000
Why are you ladies
trying to duel each other

324
00:14:29,083 --> 00:14:30,708
for the hundredth time, anyway?

325
00:14:30,791 --> 00:14:33,583
Uh... Oh, did we
not mention that already?

326
00:14:33,666 --> 00:14:35,666
Apologies.
We forgot to tell you.

327
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:37,791
As the arbitrator,
you have the right to know

328
00:14:37,875 --> 00:14:39,708
all of the pertinent details.

329
00:14:39,791 --> 00:14:43,250
You see, Kaguya and I were once
combined as a single Spirit.

330
00:14:43,333 --> 00:14:45,333
The name of
the Spirit was Yamai.

331
00:14:45,416 --> 00:14:46,458
[TWIN 2A]
Just pick me!

332
00:14:46,541 --> 00:14:48,000
[TWIN 2B]
No, you have to choose me!

333
00:14:48,083 --> 00:14:50,250
[SHIDO] So basically...

334
00:14:50,333 --> 00:14:51,750
For reasons yet to be announced,

335
00:14:51,833 --> 00:14:53,250
someday soon you'll
both have to go back

336
00:14:53,333 --> 00:14:55,041
to being a single Spirit.

337
00:14:55,125 --> 00:14:56,541
And when that happens,

338
00:14:56,625 --> 00:14:58,625
the two different personalities
won't be able to coexist,

339
00:14:58,708 --> 00:14:59,333
is that right?

340
00:14:59,416 --> 00:15:00,833
Correct.

341
00:15:00,916 --> 00:15:03,041
The personality of the original
Yamai was lost ages ago...

342
00:15:03,125 --> 00:15:05,375
Thus, Yuzuru or I
will become the new Yamai.

343
00:15:05,458 --> 00:15:07,000
For there can be only one.

344
00:15:07,083 --> 00:15:08,375
Correct.

345
00:15:08,458 --> 00:15:10,291
Explanation: In order to
determine who that will be,

346
00:15:10,375 --> 00:15:12,916
we have fought tooth
and nail for many years.

347
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:13,833
Fistfight...

348
00:15:13,916 --> 00:15:14,875
Footrace...

349
00:15:14,958 --> 00:15:15,875
Kendama...

350
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:17,000
Eating contest...

351
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:19,041
We competed in
a variety of ways.

352
00:15:19,125 --> 00:15:21,333
Those last two
were way less dramatic...

353
00:15:21,416 --> 00:15:23,458
What happens to the
personality that loses?

354
00:15:23,541 --> 00:15:25,041
[KAGUYA]
It will cease to exist.

355
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:26,208
No way!

356
00:15:26,291 --> 00:15:28,208
[KAGUYA] We really
appreciate you, Shido.

357
00:15:28,291 --> 00:15:29,541
Thanks to you,

358
00:15:29,625 --> 00:15:31,708
we can compete in a way
we've never been able to.

359
00:15:31,791 --> 00:15:32,750
[YUZURU] Affirmative.

360
00:15:32,833 --> 00:15:34,291
I have no objections
if this match

361
00:15:34,375 --> 00:15:37,333
is what makes
the final decision.

362
00:15:37,416 --> 00:15:38,250
That can't be good...

363
00:15:38,333 --> 00:15:39,541
Is there
some kind of problem?

364
00:15:39,625 --> 00:15:42,375
Yes... Fraxinus
hasn't sent any updates

365
00:15:42,458 --> 00:15:44,750
or status reports in hours.

366
00:15:44,833 --> 00:15:48,416
The reason is unknown,
but I will investigate.

367
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:49,833
Anyway.

368
00:15:49,916 --> 00:15:52,291
And now ladies, if you
would both follow me, please.

369
00:15:52,375 --> 00:15:53,916
Shin is more wily than he looks.

370
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,250
I'll give you some tips
to deal with him.

371
00:15:57,250 --> 00:15:58,708
[SHIDO]
Well, that's just great.

372
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:01,958
Two new spirits pop up, and
Reine and I have to fly solo.

373
00:16:02,041 --> 00:16:04,833
What kind of tips is she
giving for them to deal with me?

374
00:16:04,916 --> 00:16:06,625
Ah! Oh, hi, girls!

375
00:16:06,708 --> 00:16:07,958
Shido,

376
00:16:08,041 --> 00:16:09,416
I give you permission
to cleanse the impurities

377
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:12,166
that have accumulated
on your puny mortal body.

378
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:16,208
Confirmation. Please
feel free to enter the bath.

379
00:16:16,291 --> 00:16:17,250
Okay...?

380
00:16:19,666 --> 00:16:21,500
Hey... What made you
think it was all right

381
00:16:21,583 --> 00:16:22,916
to take a bath with me?

382
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,083
Duh...

383
00:16:24,166 --> 00:16:25,208
How else am I going
to make you go crazy

384
00:16:25,291 --> 00:16:27,208
for my pixie-like
feminine charm?

385
00:16:27,291 --> 00:16:29,583
Scornful.
Feminine charms, you say?

386
00:16:29,666 --> 00:16:31,083
Were you planning
to buy some here?

387
00:16:31,166 --> 00:16:33,416
Because you didn't bring
any with you, sister.

388
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,708
I swear I'll make you
pay for that later, you cow!

389
00:16:35,791 --> 00:16:38,958
Accepted. Now bring it on.

390
00:16:39,041 --> 00:16:42,000
Excuse me!
This is the men's bath!

391
00:16:42,083 --> 00:16:43,166
Which means neither
of you are even

392
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:45,541
supposed to
be on this side!

393
00:16:45,625 --> 00:16:47,708
Better prepare yourself, stud.

394
00:16:47,791 --> 00:16:49,958
I will make you realize
that you can never be satisfied

395
00:16:50,041 --> 00:16:51,458
by anyone but me.

396
00:16:51,541 --> 00:16:53,291
Negative. Just think...

397
00:16:53,375 --> 00:16:56,708
There's only a flimsy white
towel separating our flesh...

398
00:16:58,125 --> 00:17:00,250
Joystick... Game on!

399
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:10,875
Here we go. Ready?

400
00:17:10,958 --> 00:17:12,083
Out of the kindness of my heart,

401
00:17:12,166 --> 00:17:14,291
you can have the
first seduction attempt.

402
00:17:14,375 --> 00:17:15,833
Negative. Not needed.

403
00:17:15,916 --> 00:17:19,416
However, you could use any
handicap you can get, I'd wager.

404
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:20,791
Then the gloves are off.

405
00:17:20,875 --> 00:17:22,125
The moment I make my big move,

406
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:24,583
Shido's eyes will never
stray from me again.

407
00:17:24,666 --> 00:17:25,875
I just wanted to be charitable

408
00:17:25,958 --> 00:17:27,416
and let you
have a glimmer of hope.

409
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:29,041
Skeptical.

410
00:17:29,125 --> 00:17:32,083
You have no idea what it takes
to seduce a young man, do you?

411
00:17:32,166 --> 00:17:34,500
You bet I do!
I'm super foxy!

412
00:17:34,583 --> 00:17:36,125
Plus I've got a ton
of sexy techniques

413
00:17:36,208 --> 00:17:39,250
that a bore like you couldn't
dream up in a million years!

414
00:17:39,333 --> 00:17:41,833
Doubtful. Care to demonstrate?

415
00:17:41,916 --> 00:17:43,958
All right. Just you watch!

416
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,625
How do you like that?

417
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:55,333
[giggling]

418
00:17:55,416 --> 00:17:57,208
I'm confused...

419
00:17:59,625 --> 00:18:01,500
Hey!
What are you laughing at?

420
00:18:01,583 --> 00:18:02,625
Derision.

421
00:18:02,708 --> 00:18:04,166
Just as expected,
your feminine charms

422
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:05,625
leave something
to be desired.

423
00:18:05,708 --> 00:18:06,750
What did you say?

424
00:18:06,833 --> 00:18:08,416
As if a girl without
a shred of passion

425
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:10,833
would have even
the foggiest notion!

426
00:18:11,916 --> 00:18:13,000
Falsehood.

427
00:18:13,083 --> 00:18:14,500
My worst would
still be better than you.

428
00:18:14,583 --> 00:18:16,208
Why don't you
show us how it's done?

429
00:18:16,291 --> 00:18:19,000
Accepted. Here we go.

430
00:18:21,666 --> 00:18:23,125
Hi, handsome.

431
00:18:23,833 --> 00:18:25,166
Uh... Thanks.

432
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:27,958
Hahaha!
Wow. You sure showed me!

433
00:18:28,041 --> 00:18:29,666
Can't believe
you had me worried!

434
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:30,708
Livid.

435
00:18:30,791 --> 00:18:32,625
I am not interested
in your opinion.

436
00:18:32,708 --> 00:18:34,083
[KAGUYA] Same here!

437
00:18:34,166 --> 00:18:35,541
[YUZURU] Noted.

438
00:18:35,625 --> 00:18:37,125
Your childish figure is not
as effective at seduction

439
00:18:37,208 --> 00:18:38,583
as my womanly curves.

440
00:18:38,666 --> 00:18:40,583
Nonsense.
You know that we're identical!

441
00:18:40,666 --> 00:18:41,750
Rebuttal.

442
00:18:43,416 --> 00:18:45,291
Even if the
measurements are the same,

443
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:48,000
they feel completely different.

444
00:18:48,083 --> 00:18:49,708
You're underestimating
the attractiveness

445
00:18:49,791 --> 00:18:50,916
of a slender body.

446
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,125
Haughty.
Slender body, you say?

447
00:18:53,208 --> 00:18:55,125
Change the words to sound
better all you wish,

448
00:18:55,208 --> 00:18:57,875
but you cannot
alter the sad truth.

449
00:18:57,958 --> 00:18:59,125
Are you seriously bragging

450
00:18:59,208 --> 00:19:01,125
because you have
more fat on your chest?

451
00:19:01,208 --> 00:19:02,583
Indignant.

452
00:19:02,666 --> 00:19:05,000
These breasts are pristine,
but your jealousy is ugly.

453
00:19:05,083 --> 00:19:06,500
And who's jealous of you, cow?

454
00:19:06,583 --> 00:19:08,208
I'm not, you understand me?

455
00:19:08,291 --> 00:19:10,416
Shido thinks I'm cuter
than some fatty like you

456
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,875
any day of the week,
no ifs ands or buts.

457
00:19:12,958 --> 00:19:13,875
Wrong.

458
00:19:13,958 --> 00:19:14,875
When attempting
to appeal to men,

459
00:19:14,958 --> 00:19:16,708
being flat chested
is a bad thing.

460
00:19:16,791 --> 00:19:19,208
Chicken bones like yours
wouldn't rate a second glance.

461
00:19:19,291 --> 00:19:20,416
They aren't chicken bones!

462
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,625
Riposte.
Don't ever call me a "fatty"!

463
00:19:22,708 --> 00:19:24,416
You have more
split ends than I do!

464
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:27,416
Snark. You're smellier than
I am whenever you get sweaty.

465
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:28,541
Oh?

466
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:29,791
Well you have more
body fat than I do!

467
00:19:29,875 --> 00:19:31,375
Pity.

468
00:19:31,458 --> 00:19:32,708
You're not intelligent enough
to find another fault of mine

469
00:19:32,791 --> 00:19:34,333
to comment on.

470
00:19:34,416 --> 00:19:36,166
Puffity fatty-fat puffball!

471
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:37,333

--Flat-as-a-board flattenstein.
--Hold on!

The others might
show up at anytime.

474
00:19:40,333 --> 00:19:42,583
It won't look good if you're
caught in the men's bath!

475
00:19:42,666 --> 00:19:44,666
Ha! What are you
talking about, Shido?

476
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:46,875
Confirmed.
There's no need to worry.

477
00:19:46,958 --> 00:19:48,875
Uh... But why?

478
00:19:48,958 --> 00:19:51,500
[TOHKA laughing]

479
00:19:53,458 --> 00:19:55,625
I love being
first in the bath!

00:20:02,291 --> 00:20:05,208
[TOHKA, SHIDO screaming]

481
00:20:05,291 --> 00:20:06,583
Hey!

482
00:20:06,666 --> 00:20:07,750
What are you thinking,
being in a place like this?

483
00:20:07,833 --> 00:20:09,000
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

484
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:10,916
What are you doing
in the men's bathing area?

485
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,041
What are you talking about?

486
00:20:12,125 --> 00:20:13,750
I went in the room
with the red sign,

487
00:20:13,833 --> 00:20:16,125
just like
everybody told me to.

488
00:20:17,041 --> 00:20:18,416
And how'd that happen?

489
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:19,916
Well...

490
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,708
We might have switched the
signs right before you came in.

491
00:20:21,791 --> 00:20:22,791
Supplement.

492
00:20:22,875 --> 00:20:24,125
Once you came in,
we put them back.

493
00:20:24,208 --> 00:20:27,041
Like we would sink
so low to use the men's bath.

494
00:20:33,791 --> 00:20:34,958
Figures...

495
00:20:35,041 --> 00:20:36,916
I got here early to be
the first in the bath,

496
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,250
but now I'm the fourth!

497
00:20:39,333 --> 00:20:42,416
Uh... My mistake,
I kinda got tricked!

498
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:44,250
I'll get out right now!

499
00:20:47,041 --> 00:20:49,333
[screaming]

500
00:20:49,416 --> 00:20:51,291
[AI] Check it out!
The ocean is like right there!

501
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:53,333
[MAI] We would never get
a view this good at home!

502
00:20:53,416 --> 00:20:54,916
[MII] That's so lame!

503
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,250
Gotta make a plan,
and quickly.

504
00:20:57,333 --> 00:20:58,291
[TOHKA] Shido!

505
00:20:58,375 --> 00:20:59,541
I'll obstruct their view.

506
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:02,333
You can hide behind me
then try to run away!

507
00:21:02,416 --> 00:21:03,833
You sure?

508
00:21:03,916 --> 00:21:05,416
Those girls tricked you into
coming into the wrong bath.

509
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:07,291
So I'm gonna get you out!

510
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:11,416
Thank you. I owe you one.

511
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:12,708
Hey...

512
00:21:12,791 --> 00:21:14,458
Tohka, I didn't
know you were here!

513
00:21:14,541 --> 00:21:16,916
Don't hide over in the corner,
come and join us!

514
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,458
OMG, you have,
like, perfect skin!

515
00:21:19,541 --> 00:21:20,416
[MII] That's so lame...

516
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:25,250
[squealing]

517
00:21:25,333 --> 00:21:26,416
Something wrong?

518
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:28,750
No! No, everything's fine!

519
00:21:30,833 --> 00:21:32,125
[TOHKA] Look!

520
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:34,708
Is that a giant piece
of kinako bread in the sky?

521
00:21:34,791 --> 00:21:36,333
--[TOHKA] Back and to the left!
--[MAI] I don't see it...

522
00:21:36,416 --> 00:21:37,625
--Above the hotel!
--Wait! No...

523
00:21:37,708 --> 00:21:39,083
[AI] Are you feeling all right?

524
00:21:39,166 --> 00:21:41,625
[TOHKA] You just have
to look up, and away from me!

525
00:21:41,708 --> 00:21:42,958
Over that way!

526
00:21:43,041 --> 00:21:46,166
[SHIDO screaming]

527
00:21:57,666 --> 00:22:00,333
Isn't it a little early to
sneak into a woman's bedroom?

528
00:22:00,416 --> 00:22:02,958
[ELLEN] We were delayed
by unexpected circumstances.

529
00:22:03,041 --> 00:22:04,750
But we will strike tonight.

530
00:22:04,833 --> 00:22:07,875
Have Bandersnatch standing by
and ready to move.

531
00:22:11,083 --> 00:22:12,458
[TWIN 2B]
You chose me over my sister?

532
00:22:12,541 --> 00:22:14,708
[MAN 2A] It doesn't
really matter, does it?

533
00:22:14,791 --> 00:22:16,541
[YOSHINON] Yoshino?

534
00:22:16,625 --> 00:22:18,125
[YOSHINO] Yes?

535
00:22:18,208 --> 00:22:21,291
[YOSHINON] They gave us a lot of
free time on this school trip.

536
00:22:21,375 --> 00:22:22,333
Uh huh.
