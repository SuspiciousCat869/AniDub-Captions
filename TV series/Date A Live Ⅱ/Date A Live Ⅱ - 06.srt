The mysterious world of
aesthetics and perversion...

00:00:55,166 --> 00:00:59,125
The forbidden door opens right
in front of Shido's very eyes.

It's all right.

[AI] No way.

It's an attack on

We're gonna do everything we can
to make sure you win this, girl!

Our band's lost some people.

16
00:02:40,916 --> 00:02:42,291
Mainly because Ai is so selfish

17
00:02:42,375 --> 00:02:43,708
and such a nightmare
to work with.

Oh. That's right, you
wanted to play the drums, too.

I'm sorry, Tohka, but Mai is
pretty much an expert drummer.

Don't worry.

for you to play. Cool?

to play anything else?

But what is it?

A legendary instrument
that's super hard to play.

The key to any band's success.
