The frustrating thing is, you've
got to keep moving, regardless.

So encourage him.

If I do that to him now,
I'm a hypocrite.

I can't.

You don't get to decide that.

00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:03,960
You planned the Airport Attack,
and the shopping mall attack...

165
00:09:04,002 --> 00:09:05,253
It was all your doing!

166
00:09:05,295 --> 00:09:06,421
No, no!

167
00:09:06,463 --> 00:09:08,715
The blame lies with the humans!

168
00:09:08,757 --> 00:09:09,966
Society!

169
00:09:10,008 --> 00:09:12,635
I charge you all with robbery!

170
00:09:12,677 --> 00:09:13,928
You stole from us.

171
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:16,556
The world rightfully
belongs to the dragons!

172
00:09:16,598 --> 00:09:18,641
[NANATSUKI]
Look, don't be ridiculous.

173
00:09:18,683 --> 00:09:20,351
Seriously? Dragons?

174
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:22,812
Why don't you try being less of
a monster and not ruining

175
00:09:22,854 --> 00:09:25,148
people's lives over that crap!

176
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:28,526
[WARLOCK]
Tch. "Crap," you say?

177
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:31,154
[NANATSUKI gasps]
You must really be crazy

178
00:09:31,196 --> 00:09:33,281
to keep killing over
something like that?

179
00:09:33,323 --> 00:09:34,908
That's messed up.

180
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:36,743
[WARLOCK]
Oh, I see.

181
00:09:36,785 --> 00:09:37,869
Okay.

182
00:09:37,911 --> 00:09:39,746
How 'bout I ask
you something, then?

183
00:09:41,623 --> 00:09:43,958
[WARLOCK] Nine years ago,
you only survived the night

184
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,378
thanks to me, so don't I even
get some kind of "thank you"?

185
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:48,922
[NANATSUKI gasps]

186
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:50,799
Wait, what?

187
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:51,800
[DETECTIVE 10A]
Like I said.

188
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:53,468
Looks like Public Safety's
already got your base

189
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:54,844
completely pinned down!

190
00:09:54,886 --> 00:09:56,387
What the hell did you guys do?!

191
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:58,181
‐‐[explosion]
‐‐[ICHINOSE] Ah?

192
00:09:58,223 --> 00:10:00,433
What the‐‐?

193
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:05,480
[screaming]

194
00:10:05,522 --> 00:10:07,065
‐‐[ENDO] Remain calm..
‐‐Oh, good grief!

195
00:10:07,107 --> 00:10:08,066
Hey, look!

196
00:10:08,108 --> 00:10:09,818
I've got a message
here from Boss!

197
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:11,027
[AKANE]
Huh?

198
00:10:11,069 --> 00:10:14,030
[KIRYUIN] Hi. Are the three
of you all right?

199
00:10:14,072 --> 00:10:17,033
Hey, you gonna
tell us what's up?

200
00:10:17,075 --> 00:10:18,034
[KIRYUIN]
Yes.

201
00:10:18,076 --> 00:10:21,121
Special Seven's in dire straits,
as you may've guessed.

202
00:10:21,162 --> 00:10:24,624
And so, you must
not come back here.

203
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:27,752
In fact, I suggest you move
from your current position.

204
00:10:27,794 --> 00:10:28,795
[AKANE]
Hmm?

205
00:10:28,837 --> 00:10:30,004
[ENDO]
Don't worry.

206
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:32,674
Nanatsuki's young,
but I have no doubt Ichinose

207
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:34,676
will figure it out quickly.

208
00:10:34,717 --> 00:10:36,052
[BELLEMER]
Except the thing is that he has

209
00:10:36,094 --> 00:10:38,012
no stamina or any guts.

210
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:40,682
[ENDO] I think Nanatsuki
easily makes up for that.

211
00:10:40,723 --> 00:10:43,476
In any case,
let's find out what's happening.

212
00:10:43,518 --> 00:10:45,562
We're in this.

213
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:48,565
[KIRYUIN]
Samurai is right. Mm‐hmm.

214
00:10:48,606 --> 00:10:51,484
This will obviously concern
your futures, as well.

215
00:10:51,526 --> 00:10:54,779
Regardless, this is
your official order:

216
00:10:54,821 --> 00:10:56,739
Withdraw from
your position and hide out

217
00:10:56,781 --> 00:10:58,575
in a safe location.

218
00:10:58,616 --> 00:11:00,743
Over and out.

219
00:11:00,785 --> 00:11:03,329
[ICHINOSE]
Shit, what's going on?

220
00:11:03,371 --> 00:11:05,915
Nine years ago,
you only survived the night

221
00:11:05,957 --> 00:11:10,545
thanks to me, so don't I even
get some kind of "thank you"?

222
00:11:10,587 --> 00:11:14,257
Oh! Well, I guess
you don't remember.

223
00:11:14,299 --> 00:11:17,427
That makes sense,
of course you don't.

224
00:11:17,468 --> 00:11:19,888
You, who Luka Mizuma
sacrificed himself

225
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:22,140
to help all those years ago,

226
00:11:22,182 --> 00:11:25,351
have been endowed with
the power of dragons!

227
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:28,396
Luka... Mizuma...?

228
00:11:28,438 --> 00:11:30,607
[WARLOCK] That night,
you stole that power from me

229
00:11:30,648 --> 00:11:33,318
and then simply ran away.

230
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:34,944
I remember.

231
00:11:34,986 --> 00:11:38,156
Do you remember it,
Seji Nanatsuki?!

232
00:11:38,198 --> 00:11:40,033
Do you even remember
what happened to you

233
00:11:40,074 --> 00:11:41,910
nine years ago?!

234
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:55,590
[LUKA]
Hey! Is anyone there?

235
00:11:55,632 --> 00:11:57,550
[gasps]

236
00:11:57,592 --> 00:11:59,427
[LUKA]
Ah?

237
00:11:59,469 --> 00:12:01,012
You! Stay back!

238
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:04,682
[gasps]

239
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:06,976
[NANATSUKI grunting]

240
00:12:07,018 --> 00:12:09,062
[LUKA grunts]
No...

241
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:14,776
[NANATSUKI rasping]

242
00:12:14,817 --> 00:12:17,654
[NANATSUKI]
Am I... dying...?

243
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:18,863
No...

244
00:12:18,905 --> 00:12:20,531
No, I don't want...

245
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:23,576
I don't want to die...

246
00:12:23,618 --> 00:12:26,287
I can't... go...

247
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:34,754
[NANATSUKI]
Huh? Where... am I?

248
00:12:35,838 --> 00:12:36,965
I can't...

249
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:39,550
I have to go back.

250
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:41,219
[HEAVENLY VOICE 10A]
If you go back now...

251
00:12:41,261 --> 00:12:42,845
[NANATSUKI gasps]

252
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:45,765
[HEAVENLY VOICE 10A]
...then you will die.

253
00:12:45,807 --> 00:12:46,766
[NANATSUKI gasps]

254
00:12:46,808 --> 00:12:47,809
[whimpers]

255
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:48,935
[HEAVENLY VOICE 10A]
In this world,

256
00:12:48,977 --> 00:12:51,187
the concept of time
does not exist.

257
00:12:51,229 --> 00:12:54,107
Zero seconds will
never become one second.

258
00:12:54,148 --> 00:12:57,443
Therefore, death will
never come for you here.

259
00:12:57,485 --> 00:12:59,529
What? But I...

260
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:01,489
[HEAVENLY VOICE 10A]
If you stay in this world,

261
00:13:01,531 --> 00:13:03,866
your wishes will be granted.

262
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:07,578
I'll give you a beautiful house,
delicious food‐‐

263
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,872
anything you want.

264
00:13:09,914 --> 00:13:12,375
And if you'd like to see
your mother and father...

265
00:13:12,417 --> 00:13:13,835
...I'll bring them to you.

266
00:13:13,876 --> 00:13:16,254
Mom and Dad? Is that true?

267
00:13:16,296 --> 00:13:17,422
[HEAVENLY VOICE 10A]
Just stay...

268
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:19,590
Stay here forever.

269
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:25,763
[NANATSUKI]
No, I still want to go back.

270
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:27,015
[HEAVENLY VOICE 10A]
Are you mad?

271
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:31,102
If you return,
only death awaits you.

272
00:13:31,144 --> 00:13:34,188
Right, not immediately, though.

273
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:36,649
I've got at least
a minute, don't I?

274
00:13:36,691 --> 00:13:37,984
If so...

275
00:13:38,026 --> 00:13:39,986
Then I should really thank him.

276
00:13:40,028 --> 00:13:42,488
My rescuer! Right now!

277
00:13:45,366 --> 00:13:46,784
[HEAVENLY VOICE 10A]
Here it is.

278
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:49,329
This is the path
you should walk.

279
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:54,125
Keep going straight ahead
and be careful never to stray.

280
00:13:56,127 --> 00:13:57,628
[HEAVENLY VOICE 10A]
Leaving already?

281
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:58,921
Yeah.

282
00:13:58,963 --> 00:14:02,050
When it comes to thanking
people, sooner's always better!

283
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:09,015
Hey, you! Hang in there!

284
00:14:09,057 --> 00:14:11,100
Wake up! Come on!

285
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:14,520
I don't... know...

286
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:18,858
[LUKA] Yeah, well,
I don't know, either,

287
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:20,735
but this is our chance.

288
00:14:20,777 --> 00:14:23,863
[NANATSUKI]
Oh, wait... I'm here...

289
00:14:23,905 --> 00:14:28,826
I need to say... thank you
for saving me...

290
00:14:30,495 --> 00:14:31,788
[NANATSUKI]
That's right.

291
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:33,581
That night, I...

292
00:14:33,623 --> 00:14:37,377
[WARLOCK] Exactly. You stole
a great power from me.

293
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:41,089
It's just such a damn shame.

294
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:43,841
I mean, after the huge amount of
effort I put into the planning

295
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:45,927
and the blood sacrifice.

296
00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:48,137
Try putting yourself in
my shoes and imagine

297
00:14:48,179 --> 00:14:50,014
how it must have felt
when I realized

298
00:14:50,056 --> 00:14:51,849
the whole thing went to waste!

299
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:54,268
[NANATSUKI growls]
Quit fooling around.

300
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:56,270
[WARLOCK]
I assure you, I'm serious.

301
00:14:56,312 --> 00:14:59,440
Actually, come to think of it,
I'm always serious.

302
00:14:59,482 --> 00:15:02,735
By the way, setting all
the other things aside...

303
00:15:02,777 --> 00:15:05,613
...do you know what became
of Luka Mizuma after that?

304
00:15:05,655 --> 00:15:07,031
[NANATSUKI gasps]

305
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:14,122
[WARLOCK] Hey. Were you able
to break the Kasai seal?

306
00:15:14,163 --> 00:15:16,666
[LUKA]
Without a hitch.

307
00:15:16,707 --> 00:15:17,834
[WARLOCK]
Wonderful.

308
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:20,128
That means only
the center is left, then.

309
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:23,131
Good work, my friend.

310
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:25,842
You see, you, Seiji Nanatsuki,
stole my power

311
00:15:25,883 --> 00:15:28,428
and then had the gall
to actually survive.

312
00:15:28,469 --> 00:15:32,181
So, in exchange,
Luka Mizuma sacrificed his life

313
00:15:32,223 --> 00:15:33,558
and became mine.

314
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:34,809
[NANATSUKI whimpers]

315
00:15:37,728 --> 00:15:40,523
If you hadn't been there
on that fateful night,

316
00:15:40,565 --> 00:15:42,650
and if you hadn't
managed to survive it,

317
00:15:42,692 --> 00:15:46,571
then he wouldn't have had to
offer himself up in your place.

318
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:50,575
Luka Mizuma would have
gone on to be a fine detective.

319
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:52,702
[NANATSUKI whimpers]

320
00:15:54,745 --> 00:15:57,457
But I'm afraid
it's far too late, now!

321
00:15:57,498 --> 00:15:59,667
Too much time has passed,
and his hands have been

322
00:15:59,709 --> 00:16:01,294
stained with blood.

323
00:16:01,335 --> 00:16:02,837
His honor's been
reduced to nothing

324
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:04,755
but the most worthless trash.

325
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:07,842
May I finish him?

326
00:16:07,884 --> 00:16:09,677
Oh, that isn't going to work.

327
00:16:09,719 --> 00:16:12,346
He's like me, it'll take
a whole lot more than a gun

328
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:14,182
to kill him now.

329
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:16,434
It's going to take
a little time.

330
00:16:16,476 --> 00:16:19,270
Detective... Mizuma...

331
00:16:20,438 --> 00:16:21,647
[ICHINOSE grunts]

332
00:16:23,274 --> 00:16:25,401
[NANATSUKI]
Ichinose.

333
00:16:25,443 --> 00:16:28,404
Wow, Luka, is that you?

334
00:16:28,446 --> 00:16:31,240
[WARLOCK]
Hey there, former partner!

335
00:16:31,282 --> 00:16:33,951
I guess this is your
nine‐year reunion!

336
00:16:36,913 --> 00:16:38,122
Stay there.

337
00:16:38,164 --> 00:16:39,999
Don't move!

338
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:42,502
Why? You never
hit your mark, anyway.

339
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:43,669
[growls]

340
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:47,590
Run for it, Rookie!

341
00:16:50,134 --> 00:16:52,887
[WARLOCK] Sure, yes,
you can run all you like!

342
00:16:52,929 --> 00:16:56,974
It doesn't matter; nothing
you do will save you now.

343
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:59,936
Your work here has
come to an end, Luka Mizuma.

344
00:16:59,977 --> 00:17:01,604
Nice job.

345
00:17:01,646 --> 00:17:04,440
You have my blessing
to do whatever you please.

346
00:17:04,482 --> 00:17:06,817
Meaning?

347
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:08,194
Meaning you're free.

348
00:17:08,236 --> 00:17:10,029
Really free.

349
00:17:10,071 --> 00:17:11,906
[phone ringing]

350
00:17:11,948 --> 00:17:12,907
[ICHINOSE]
It's me.

351
00:17:12,949 --> 00:17:14,242
[BELLEMER] I think
this line's being tapped,

352
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:15,493
so I'll make this short.

353
00:17:15,535 --> 00:17:17,495
Don't go back to Special Seven.

354
00:17:17,537 --> 00:17:18,746
[ICHINOSE]
Why not?

355
00:17:18,788 --> 00:17:21,290
BELLEMER] Just think through
the details over a bowl of pho!

356
00:17:21,332 --> 00:17:22,750
[busy single beeps]

357
00:17:22,792 --> 00:17:24,585
Rookie, it's time to go.

358
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:30,675
[ICHINOSE]
Rookie.

359
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:32,051
Yeah, sorry.

360
00:17:32,093 --> 00:17:32,927
Right behind you.

361
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:41,686
[door bells jingling]

362
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:42,812
[GROUP]
Hm?

363
00:17:42,853 --> 00:17:44,146
Figured you were here.

364
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:46,190
[BELLEMER]
Hi there! Glad you made it!

365
00:17:46,232 --> 00:17:47,650
[ICHINOSE]
Where's Nijo?

366
00:17:47,692 --> 00:17:49,735
[ENDO]
Haven't been able to reach him.

367
00:17:49,777 --> 00:17:51,070
But you know how he is.

368
00:17:51,112 --> 00:17:52,947
I'm sure he's fine.

369
00:17:52,989 --> 00:17:53,948
I guess.

370
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:55,449
[AKANE]
More importantly...

371
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:57,827
You two aren't looking so good.

372
00:17:57,868 --> 00:17:59,453
Well, that can wait.

373
00:17:59,495 --> 00:18:01,330
What's our situation?

374
00:18:01,372 --> 00:18:03,082
Don't really know.

375
00:18:04,542 --> 00:18:07,878
[KIRYUIN] Happy to explain,
if you'd like me to.

376
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,214
But it won't be
a very pleasant story.

377
00:18:11,966 --> 00:18:13,968
[ICHINOSE] Let me see if
I've got this straight.

378
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:16,304
Warlock escapes,
and Public Safety chooses

379
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:18,514
the same time to go after us?

380
00:18:18,556 --> 00:18:21,017
Hey, Boss,
are you gonna be okay?

381
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:23,436
[KIRYUIN] Oh, I'm a
fairly important person.

382
00:18:23,477 --> 00:18:25,730
I'll be fine for the present.

383
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:28,566
Now, as for Warlock...

384
00:18:28,608 --> 00:18:30,610
Footage of him killing
the judge and prosecutor

385
00:18:30,651 --> 00:18:33,070
without a gun has
already leaked online.

386
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:37,033
So, thanks to that, the level of
Nine‐bashing has increased.

387
00:18:37,074 --> 00:18:39,452
[KIRYUIN] Fortunately, I do
think we have a little more time

388
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:42,830
before Nine decides to
make a move in earnest.

389
00:18:42,872 --> 00:18:45,166
But our only real hope
is to subdue Warlock

390
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:47,043
before that happens.

391
00:18:48,294 --> 00:18:51,839
Hey, Boss,
it's time you told us.

392
00:18:51,881 --> 00:18:54,258
You've always seemed to know
a lot about Warlock.

393
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:55,926
What is it he's after?

394
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:00,097
[KIRYUIN]
I'll admit, what Warlock says

395
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:02,058
is actually half true.

396
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:04,393
His most important goal
right now is to strengthen

397
00:19:04,435 --> 00:19:06,312
the dragons' power.

398
00:19:06,354 --> 00:19:08,230
No way...

399
00:19:08,272 --> 00:19:11,400
[KIRYUIN] You see, worship is
what makes a dragon stronger.

400
00:19:11,442 --> 00:19:14,904
The more humans fear,
respect, and revere his power,

401
00:19:14,945 --> 00:19:17,365
well, the greater it becomes.

402
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:19,825
So, is making
sacrifices also considered

403
00:19:19,867 --> 00:19:21,661
an act of worship?

404
00:19:21,702 --> 00:19:22,995
[KIRYUIN]
Yes.

405
00:19:23,037 --> 00:19:25,289
However, a fatal
error occurred during

406
00:19:25,331 --> 00:19:27,500
the attack nine years ago.

407
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:30,044
The power that Warlock
was trying to seize

408
00:19:30,086 --> 00:19:33,964
was accidentally passed
to a human instead.

409
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:35,549
You mean Rookie, right?

410
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:37,468
[gasping]

411
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:38,719
[KIRYUIN]
Exactly.

412
00:19:38,761 --> 00:19:42,014
I apologize for not
telling you until now.

413
00:19:42,056 --> 00:19:46,185
But during the Airport Attack
nine years ago, our Rookie here

414
00:19:46,227 --> 00:19:48,729
inherited the dragons' power.

415
00:19:48,771 --> 00:19:51,565
[ICHINOSE] So that's the
reason he's so tough, then?

416
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:55,319
[KIRYUIN] Right.
Even guns can't kill Nanatsuki.

417
00:19:55,361 --> 00:19:57,697
He's also probably
the only human capable

418
00:19:57,738 --> 00:19:59,865
of withstanding Warlock's power.

419
00:19:59,907 --> 00:20:01,742
Incredible!

420
00:20:01,784 --> 00:20:04,745
[KIRYUIN] But regardless of
that, Warlock never gave up.

421
00:20:04,787 --> 00:20:07,623
Even now, he's trying to launch
yet another terrorist attack,

422
00:20:07,665 --> 00:20:09,583
with the help of the lost
souls who are drawn

423
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:11,377
to his power, of course.

424
00:20:11,419 --> 00:20:13,963
Hey, Boss, level with us, okay?

425
00:20:14,004 --> 00:20:16,465
Is Warlock actually
as strong as a dragon?

426
00:20:16,507 --> 00:20:19,385
Like the one in
the shopping mall?

427
00:20:19,427 --> 00:20:22,012
[KIRYUIN] Let me be as clear
as I can possibly be:

428
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:25,850
That thing you saw in the
shopping mall was nothing.

429
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:27,309
He's that strong?

430
00:20:27,351 --> 00:20:29,228
[KIRYUIN]
It could still be a lot worse.

431
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:31,981
If the power that was sealed in
the airport had gathered to him

432
00:20:32,022 --> 00:20:34,191
as he planned,
the challenge we face now

433
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:36,527
would be more than doubled.

434
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:39,238
So, how can we stop Warlock now?

435
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,282
[KIRYUIN]
The only way to do that

436
00:20:41,323 --> 00:20:44,326
is rooted in your power,
Seiji Nanatsuki.

437
00:20:44,368 --> 00:20:45,953
That's the key.

438
00:20:45,995 --> 00:20:48,414
[ICHINOSE] What you're saying
is Rookie's the only one

439
00:20:48,456 --> 00:20:50,249
who can beat Warlock?

440
00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:51,584
[KIRYUIN]
Oh, no.

441
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:53,836
It's going to take
all of us, no doubt.

442
00:20:55,504 --> 00:20:57,047
I don't know...

443
00:20:59,216 --> 00:21:02,553
Rookie and I are
gonna go have a talk.

444
00:21:02,595 --> 00:21:04,597
[KIRYUIN]
Understood.

445
00:21:04,638 --> 00:21:06,098
[ICHINOSE]
Come on.

446
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:12,646
[KIRYUIN] Now, listen, the rest
of you have a pretty big choice

447
00:21:12,688 --> 00:21:14,315
to make, as well.

448
00:21:14,356 --> 00:21:15,566
What do you mean?

449
00:21:15,608 --> 00:21:17,359
[KIRYUIN] Well, now that
it's clear Public Safety

450
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:21,489
is against us, there's a strong
possibility that your families

451
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:23,532
could be in real danger.

452
00:21:23,574 --> 00:21:25,034
Consider that.

453
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:31,791
[NIJO]
Luka Mizuma!

454
00:21:31,832 --> 00:21:33,042
What is it?

455
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:34,293
This time...

456
00:21:34,335 --> 00:21:35,836
...I'm here to kill you.

[NANATSUKI sobbing]

460
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:58,526
[NANATSUKI] In the end, I made
the totally selfish choice!

461
00:21:58,567 --> 00:22:00,653
[sobs]
I should've just...

462
00:22:00,694 --> 00:22:03,322
I should've just let myself die!

463
00:22:03,364 --> 00:22:08,327
[NANATSUKI whines] If I...
had only died that day...
