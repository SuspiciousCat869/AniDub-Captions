If you look carefully,

345
00:18:41,871 --> 00:18:45,041
there should be one spot on its
throat that's a different color.

If you target that,
you might be able to defeat it.

"Might," huh?

They might easily accept
their impending death

a former member of Nine

to be one of the perpetrators

of the Airport Attack
nine years ago.

So that means, I think,

420
00:23:16,353 --> 00:23:19,231
that he'll probably be
extradited to Japan soon.
