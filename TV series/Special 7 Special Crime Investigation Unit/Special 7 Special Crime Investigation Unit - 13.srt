1
00:01:41,602 --> 00:01:44,479
[NANATSUKI] I was told
to find my own justice,

2
00:01:44,521 --> 00:01:47,316
but what does that even mean?

3
00:01:47,357 --> 00:01:50,777
Do I unflinchingly reject
evil without hesitation?

4
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:53,238
Do I fight? Should I win?

5
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,948
I don't know.

6
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:57,200
What is justice?

7
00:01:57,242 --> 00:01:58,869
I wonder.

8
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:00,287
Still...

9
00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:02,122
I'm stopping this guy!

10
00:02:02,164 --> 00:02:04,082
[WARLOCK]
It's showtime!

11
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:07,961
[NANATSUKI grunting]

12
00:02:08,003 --> 00:02:10,672
[ICHINOSE grunting]

13
00:02:10,714 --> 00:02:13,342
Damn! I thought I could
at least hit that thing.

14
00:02:16,678 --> 00:02:17,971
[gasps]

15
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:23,518
[ENDO]
Hmph.

16
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,603
[AKANE]
What's up, guys?

17
00:02:24,645 --> 00:02:26,438
Sorry we're late!

18
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,940
Shikisai! Follow my lead!

19
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:30,108
[AKANE]
Right!

20
00:02:34,196 --> 00:02:36,239
[AKANE bellows]

21
00:02:39,743 --> 00:02:40,702
It's tough.

22
00:02:40,744 --> 00:02:42,579
As if you could beat a dragon!

23
00:02:42,621 --> 00:02:45,999
But I'm very much
enjoying watching you try!

24
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:46,958
Ah?

25
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,794
How about this?

26
00:02:50,045 --> 00:02:52,089
[NANATSUKI grunting]

27
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:56,259
[NANATSUKI yells]

28
00:02:56,301 --> 00:02:57,761
It worked?

29
00:02:57,803 --> 00:03:00,013
Try taking another guess!

30
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:03,850
[gasps]

31
00:03:03,892 --> 00:03:06,520
After all, we're different
species, you and I!

32
00:03:06,561 --> 00:03:08,313
Don't forget who I am!

33
00:03:08,355 --> 00:03:11,316
Dragons have always been
the rulers of this world!

34
00:03:11,358 --> 00:03:14,361
You see, every last
one of you is inferior!

35
00:03:14,403 --> 00:03:15,529
We're not done!

36
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:19,533
If we just keep breaking it over
and over, then we can beat him!

37
00:03:19,574 --> 00:03:22,035
I'll smash as many
of 'em as it takes!

38
00:03:22,077 --> 00:03:25,080
[WARLOCK] Hello, all you pieces
of shit around the world!

39
00:03:25,122 --> 00:03:27,624
Do you see my dragon power?

40
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:31,837
Man, his voice is seriously
giving me a headache, now.

41
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:33,004
[ICHINOSE]
Think.

42
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:34,339
He's a dragon.

43
00:03:34,381 --> 00:03:37,008
The faith of Nine's members
is the source of his power,

44
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:38,885
so obviously he's hoping
to spread that faith

45
00:03:38,927 --> 00:03:41,221
all over the world.

46
00:03:41,263 --> 00:03:42,681
The answer's clear.

47
00:03:42,723 --> 00:03:45,100
We're gonna have to
take that faith away.

48
00:03:45,142 --> 00:03:47,102
But the big question is how.

49
00:03:47,144 --> 00:03:48,353
[phone rings]

50
00:03:48,395 --> 00:03:49,688
Uh?

51
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:51,648
[NIJO]
Slacking off, as usual, I see.

52
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:54,067
[ICHINOSE] Nah, just goofin'
around with a dragon.

53
00:03:54,109 --> 00:03:56,653
[NIJO]
Yes. I can see you from here.

54
00:03:56,695 --> 00:03:58,655
I'm taking a breather.

55
00:03:58,697 --> 00:04:02,200
Listen. There's not much
time, so I'll make this brief.

56
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:05,454
That park below. Get Warlock
down there, all right?

57
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:07,789
Ah?

58
00:04:07,831 --> 00:04:09,374
I'll trust you.

59
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:10,959
Thank you for that.

60
00:04:13,295 --> 00:04:14,588
Well, Boss,
I don't think your life's

61
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:16,214
in any danger, at least.

62
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:18,216
Thank you, Bellemer.

63
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:19,843
Look at that strength.

64
00:04:19,885 --> 00:04:21,386
Which one do you mean?

65
00:04:21,428 --> 00:04:22,929
Both of them.

66
00:04:22,971 --> 00:04:25,015
Huh?

67
00:04:25,056 --> 00:04:27,976
[KIRYUIN] Warlock is
disturbingly powerful.

68
00:04:28,018 --> 00:04:30,145
He's stolen the power
of dragons and now he wants

69
00:04:30,187 --> 00:04:33,690
the faith of humans to
help make him even stronger.

70
00:04:33,732 --> 00:04:35,776
Wow. I didn't know that.

71
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:37,527
Yet, this team still fights.

72
00:04:37,569 --> 00:04:40,155
Your fearlessness
always amazes me.

73
00:04:40,197 --> 00:04:42,824
I have some very fine comrades.

74
00:04:42,866 --> 00:04:44,326
[yells]

75
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:45,952
Hey, Belle! Come here!

76
00:04:45,994 --> 00:04:47,287
[BELLEMER]
Yeah, what is it?

77
00:04:47,329 --> 00:04:49,372
[ICHINOSE] I want you to use
your drones, if you can.

78
00:04:49,414 --> 00:04:51,917
Evacuate residents
around the park.

79
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:52,959
Can you do it?

80
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:54,503
I sure can!

81
00:04:58,715 --> 00:05:00,467
[BELLEMER]
This is the police.

82
00:05:00,509 --> 00:05:04,596
Looks like there are some,
uh, well, bombs or something.

83
00:05:04,638 --> 00:05:07,849
and they've been planted
all over this area!

84
00:05:07,891 --> 00:05:12,312
So, all civilians,
please evacuate at once, okay?

85
00:05:13,563 --> 00:05:16,316
[BELLEMER] I hacked into the
traffic light control system,

86
00:05:16,358 --> 00:05:19,152
and I set all the lights
around the area to red.

87
00:05:19,194 --> 00:05:20,737
[ICHINOSE]
Excellent work.

88
00:05:20,779 --> 00:05:23,532
But, um, how's
this gonna help us?

89
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:25,659
[ICHINOSE]
Hm. Rookie!

[NANATSUKI groans]

91
00:05:27,619 --> 00:05:30,580
[ICHINOSE] Try to force
Warlock to move to the park!

92
00:05:30,622 --> 00:05:32,249
How do I do that?

93
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:34,709
Use your dragon
power and figure it out!

94
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:37,045
[NANATSUKI] There are things
I can do and things I can't!

95
00:05:37,087 --> 00:05:38,964
[ICHINOSE]
Just make it happen!

96
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:41,716
Keh. Fine. Okay.

97
00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:43,552
Well, then, here goes nothing!

98
00:05:43,593 --> 00:05:44,594
Huh?

99
00:05:44,636 --> 00:05:46,304
[bellows]

100
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:48,598
You really don't
know when to quit!

You can try all you like,
but it won't‐‐

[NANATSUKI grunting]

104

[WARLOCK chuckles]
You're a funny one.

105
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:13,915
Trying to shield your
friends, aren't you?

106
00:06:13,957 --> 00:06:15,417
But you know, kid,

107
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:18,044
it's really only
a matter of time.

108
00:06:18,086 --> 00:06:19,045
And, look!

109
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:20,964
It's the beginning of round two.

110
00:06:21,006 --> 00:06:23,675
So why not now?

111
00:06:23,717 --> 00:06:25,594
I'll say it again.

112
00:06:25,635 --> 00:06:27,596
Warlock, you're under arrest!

113
00:06:28,179 --> 00:06:30,181
[ICHINOSE]
All right, looks like he did it.

114
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:33,226
[AKANE] Okay, but,
what do we do now, then?

115
00:06:33,268 --> 00:06:34,644
[ICHINOSE]
We've got to get down there.

116
00:06:34,686 --> 00:06:37,355
Can't believe I'm saying
this, but let's run.

117
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:38,690
[BELLEMER]
Wait, you guys!

118
00:06:39,566 --> 00:06:40,567
Check this out!

119
00:06:40,609 --> 00:06:43,278
You two can both ride on these!

120
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,613
[BOTH]
Seriously?

121
00:06:44,654 --> 00:06:46,740
Seriously!

122
00:06:46,781 --> 00:06:48,491
So, uh, how sure
are we that this is

123
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:49,993
actually gonna work?

124
00:06:50,035 --> 00:06:52,078
[BELLEMER] My calculations
say that it will!

125
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,955
Wait! Belle, listen!

126
00:06:53,997 --> 00:06:56,708
It's just that recently,
I've put on a little‐‐

127
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:58,126
Waugh!

[ICHINOSE screams]

130
00:07:01,755 --> 00:07:03,673
That was really
something else, Belle.

131
00:07:03,715 --> 00:07:05,717
Ninja, after all!

132
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:06,801
In that case...

133
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:09,721
I'll live up to my code name
and give 'em a little back up.

134
00:07:10,221 --> 00:07:11,765
Have some of this.

135
00:07:11,806 --> 00:07:13,308
[NANATSUKI]
I'm not beaten yet!

136
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:15,060
[WARLOCK] For someone
who hasn't got a chance,

137
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:16,728
you sure are persistent.

138
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:19,564
I do! Boss told me so!

139
00:07:19,606 --> 00:07:21,566
And you believe that old fool?

140
00:07:21,608 --> 00:07:23,985
Yes, of course I do!

141
00:07:24,027 --> 00:07:26,446
In him. In my comrades.

142
00:07:26,488 --> 00:07:28,323
Most of all, in justice!

143
00:07:28,365 --> 00:07:30,575
[WARLOCK]
Justice is on my side!

144
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:33,161
After all, might makes right.

145
00:07:33,203 --> 00:07:35,872
So, for as long
as I'm still a dragon,

146
00:07:35,914 --> 00:07:37,916
I am justice!

147
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:39,292
[NANATSUKI groans]

148
00:07:41,753 --> 00:07:42,879
[chuckles]

149
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:44,839
[NANATSUKI]
Maybe so...

150
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:47,300
Huh?

151
00:07:47,342 --> 00:07:49,469
[NANATSUKI] Your justice
might make sense to you.

152
00:07:49,511 --> 00:07:51,638
We all have our own paths.

153
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,973
Peh.

154
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:54,975
But I refuse to accept it.

155
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:56,267
See?

156
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:58,311
Then, evil is just as good.

157
00:07:58,353 --> 00:08:01,106
But none of this changes
the fact that I'm a ruler here

158
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:03,274
and you're nothing but a slave.

159
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:04,651
[NANATSUKI]
What're you saying?

160
00:08:04,693 --> 00:08:06,861
That you can control
the entire world?

161
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:10,198
[WARLOCK]
Yes. Yes, I certainly can!

162
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,617
Because this world is all mine!

163
00:08:12,659 --> 00:08:16,329
This whole thing belongs to me!

164
00:08:16,371 --> 00:08:18,039
We're different species.

165
00:08:18,081 --> 00:08:20,792
Most humans don't see
things so black and white.

166
00:08:20,834 --> 00:08:22,460
Fortunately, it's harder
for us to come to

167
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:24,838
that kind of conclusion.

168
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:29,467
I'm still deciding where I land
on a lot of things in this life.

169
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:30,635
But...

170
00:08:30,677 --> 00:08:32,679
...I have no doubt
about stopping you!

171
00:08:32,721 --> 00:08:33,805
Not one!

172
00:08:33,847 --> 00:08:35,140
[ICHINOSE]
You got that right.

173
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:36,641
Ah. [gasps]

174
00:08:37,392 --> 00:08:38,393
Hey, there!

175
00:08:38,435 --> 00:08:40,645
Warlock. Tell me‐‐

176
00:08:40,687 --> 00:08:42,564
Didn't you just say that
you controlled this world,

177
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:44,524
or something dumb like that?

178
00:08:44,566 --> 00:08:47,902
I did. It happens
to be the truth.

179
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:49,779
No, you're wrong.

180
00:08:49,821 --> 00:08:52,532
The real truth is that there's
not a single thing in this world

181
00:08:52,574 --> 00:08:54,868
that's actually
under your control.

182
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:57,704
[WARLOCK] You really are quite
the comedian, aren't you?

183
00:08:57,746 --> 00:09:00,331
Well? Enlighten me, then.

184
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:02,292
What don't I control?

185
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:03,835
[ICHINOSE]
The humans.

186
00:09:03,877 --> 00:09:06,254
You have this idea that you
rule the human world,

187
00:09:06,296 --> 00:09:08,089
and I hate to be the
one to break it to you,

188
00:09:08,131 --> 00:09:10,300
but you're gravely mistaken.

189
00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:12,427
What do you mean by that?

190
00:09:12,469 --> 00:09:14,012
That you're wrong.

191
00:09:14,054 --> 00:09:15,096
Sorry.

192
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:19,100
[WARLOCK]
What?

193
00:09:19,142 --> 00:09:20,143
Hey!

194
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:25,231
Wait, is that...?

195
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:36,284
[LUKA]
I came to keep my promise.

196
00:09:36,326 --> 00:09:38,078
Glad you could make it.

197
00:09:41,498 --> 00:09:43,541
I don't get it, you're...

198
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:44,626
Super dead?

199
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:46,461
I'm sure you thought so.

200
00:09:46,503 --> 00:09:48,838
Even if he wasn't,
he wouldn't defy you, would he?

201
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,590
Just unthinkable.

202
00:09:50,632 --> 00:09:52,967
So, maybe I was wrong.

203
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:55,178
I mean, what difference
does it make?

204
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:57,472
A single, lowly human!

205
00:09:57,514 --> 00:09:59,682
[ICHINOSE] I get that
you're big stuff, okay?

206
00:09:59,724 --> 00:10:02,644
Literally. I get that you're
a superior species or whatever.

207
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:03,853
But the truth is,

208
00:10:03,895 --> 00:10:06,773
you're a massive
failure as a dragon.

209
00:10:06,815 --> 00:10:08,441
[WARLOCK]
What did you say?

210
00:10:08,483 --> 00:10:10,735
[ICHINOSE] You can't exist
without human faith.

211
00:10:10,777 --> 00:10:13,029
You wouldn't be
here without them.

212
00:10:13,071 --> 00:10:14,864
Yet, you consistently
kill humans,

213
00:10:14,906 --> 00:10:17,784
use them however you like,
and look down on them.

214
00:10:17,826 --> 00:10:19,828
See the contradiction?

215
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:22,122
[WARLOCK]
What contradiction?

216
00:10:22,163 --> 00:10:24,624
[ICHINOSE] Could it be that
deep down you're actually

217
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:25,917
jealous of humans?

218
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:28,002
[gasps]

219
00:10:28,044 --> 00:10:31,005
You brainwashed this man
standing here in front of you.

220
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:33,299
It must've been great having
a person with a strong sense

221
00:10:33,341 --> 00:10:35,426
of justice on your side.

222
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:37,053
But there's no doubt about it,

223
00:10:37,095 --> 00:10:39,222
that pleasure was
born out of jealousy.

224
00:10:39,264 --> 00:10:41,641
It was just your vengeful,
jealous desire to make him

225
00:10:41,683 --> 00:10:44,769
fall as low as you.

226
00:10:44,811 --> 00:10:46,062
I'm jealous?

227
00:10:46,104 --> 00:10:47,689
What, me?

228
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:50,108
What a bunch of nonsense!
[gasps]

229
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:51,401
[ICHINOSE]
Look at that.

230
00:10:51,442 --> 00:10:53,319
You're just a sad,
tiny creature who's frightened

231
00:10:53,361 --> 00:10:55,405
and envious of humans.

232
00:10:55,446 --> 00:10:58,366
Kind of a pathetic
sight, really.

233
00:10:58,408 --> 00:10:59,951
[WARLOCK]
I will kill you.

234
00:10:59,993 --> 00:11:01,578
I will.

235
00:11:01,619 --> 00:11:05,081
You see? There it is, that anger
actually grows out of fear.

236
00:11:05,123 --> 00:11:06,499
Ha, ha. Yep!

237
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:09,043
You're almost as
easy to read as a human!

238
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:10,461
Fun, right?

239
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:12,088
You go to hell!

240
00:11:13,173 --> 00:11:17,677
[WARLOCK yells]

241
00:11:19,304 --> 00:11:21,055
Is everybody ready?

242
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:24,184
[grunting]

243
00:11:24,225 --> 00:11:26,144
Good to go, Ichinose!

244
00:11:27,812 --> 00:11:29,939

[WARLOCK yelps]

247
00:11:37,864 --> 00:11:38,990
Got a hit!

248
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:41,284
I'm coming for you!

Nice work, Belle!

[BELLEMER humming]

255
00:12:10,647 --> 00:12:13,316
Looks like your precious
dragon is crumbling!

256
00:12:13,358 --> 00:12:17,028
[gasps] Who do these
humans think they are?

257
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:19,989
They should know better than
to piss me off by now!

258
00:12:21,783 --> 00:12:22,867
[NANATSUKI]
Secured!

259
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:25,787
What? Just get off of me!

260
00:12:25,828 --> 00:12:28,164
No, I'll never let you escape!

261
00:12:28,206 --> 00:12:29,874
Please. As if I'd try!

262
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:31,459
Get the hell off!

263
00:12:31,501 --> 00:12:32,710
[NANATSUKI yelps]

264
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:34,379
Hey, Mizuma!

265
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:38,383
I want you to kill all of them!
And that's a direct order!

266
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:39,801
I refuse.

267
00:12:39,842 --> 00:12:41,427
No, I crushed your spirit.

268
00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:43,137
So you can't refuse me.

269
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:44,639
Even if they're broken,

270
00:12:44,681 --> 00:12:46,766
people can still
get back on their feet.

271
00:12:46,808 --> 00:12:49,018
You're talking
complete nonsense!

272
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:50,478
Impossible!

273
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:52,855
It's not, no!

274
00:12:52,897 --> 00:12:55,566
It's being human!

275
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:57,694
Hey, follow my lead.

276
00:12:57,735 --> 00:12:58,778
[NANATSUKI]
Right!

277
00:12:58,820 --> 00:12:59,779
[WARLOCK grunts]

278
00:12:59,821 --> 00:13:00,863
Now, aim...

279
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:02,198
...and fire!

280

[roars]

281
00:13:06,953 --> 00:13:08,121
It hit!

282
00:13:08,162 --> 00:13:10,873
That's one shot
I couldn't afford to miss.

283
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:12,542
It's impossible...

284
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:15,169
This can't really
be happening to me...

285
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:18,798
Why...? Why is my power
vanishing now...?

00:13:21,009 --> 00:13:23,928
[WARLOCK]
What is going on?!

287
00:13:28,599 --> 00:13:30,643
Looks like you lost.

288
00:13:31,436 --> 00:13:35,148
[WARLOCK gasps]
What...? What is happening...?

289
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:36,733
I don't understand...

290
00:13:36,774 --> 00:13:39,527
I don't understand!

291
00:13:39,569 --> 00:13:41,070
It's all over, Warlock.

292
00:13:41,112 --> 00:13:42,655
Just give up.

293
00:13:42,697 --> 00:13:45,325
'Cause, regardless
of what you may become,

we'll never submit to you again.

295
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:50,079
Don't you remember
what I told you?

296
00:13:50,121 --> 00:13:53,374
You really can't beat humans,
no matter what.

297
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:55,668
I've lost to mere humans...

298
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:58,004
How can this be?

299
00:13:58,046 --> 00:14:00,214
Hey, tell me, Warlock.

300
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:01,799
What was it that
finally made you fear

301
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:04,010
a lowly human being, huh?

302
00:14:04,052 --> 00:14:06,262
That he broke free
of your brainwashing?

303
00:14:06,304 --> 00:14:09,265
Or was it because he
managed to stand up to you?

304
00:14:09,307 --> 00:14:10,808
[WARLOCK]
Damn you all!

305
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:14,437
Give me power!
Put your faith in me!

Come on, I have
the power you want!

307
00:14:16,647 --> 00:14:18,733
I mean, I'm a freaking dragon!

308
00:14:18,775 --> 00:14:23,613
[sobs]
I'm... superior to humans...

309
00:14:23,654 --> 00:14:25,531
So... why...?

310
00:14:25,573 --> 00:14:27,283
[KIRYUIN] Human beings
learned to live without us

a very long time ago.

312
00:14:29,369 --> 00:14:31,537
[WARLOCK]
That's just nonsense!

313
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:34,082
Tell me what his
power is, then! Huh?!

314
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:35,291
Without a dragon's power,

315
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:38,836
there's no way he could even
have fought me like he did!

316
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:40,630
That may well be.

317
00:14:40,671 --> 00:14:44,425
But, now, if you really
have lost all of your power,

318
00:14:44,467 --> 00:14:46,594
then I don't need mine, either.

One day soon,

cease to be just.

is enough for me.

You're a fool!

What the...? Hold on.

Why won't it activate?

On top of the fact
that you can't believe in

328
00:15:12,954 --> 00:15:14,914
yourself anymore, either.

329
00:15:14,956 --> 00:15:17,750
[WARLOCK grunts]
No, that's...

330
00:15:17,792 --> 00:15:19,710
That's ridiculous!

331
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:23,589
[screams]

332
00:15:25,091 --> 00:15:26,592
Rookie.

333
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:30,680
[WARLOCK]
Kill me...

334
00:15:30,721 --> 00:15:31,681
Kill me...!

335
00:15:31,722 --> 00:15:33,891
[ICHINOSE]
Nope. We won't kill you.

336
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:36,477
I'm afraid you're going
to be arrested as a human,

337
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:39,522
and you'll be sentenced
as a human, too.

338
00:15:39,564 --> 00:15:42,900
The time is 5:14 PM.

339
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:44,652
You are under arrest.

340
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:49,907
Why, you...

341
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:51,159
Take 'em off me!

342
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,578
Come on, I won't stand
for this‐‐ I can't!

343
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:55,037
Get 'em off!

344
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:57,623
Damn! Damn!

345
00:15:57,665 --> 00:16:00,209
Damn it all!

346
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:04,046
Now, come with us.

347
00:16:10,303 --> 00:16:14,056
I wanna thank you
for saving my life.

348
00:16:19,854 --> 00:16:21,189
I, um...

349
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:32,283
[KIRYUIN sighs]
It's over.

350
00:16:38,164 --> 00:16:40,333
[ICHINOSE]
Hey, it's been nine years.

351
00:16:40,374 --> 00:16:42,168
Don't you want to catch up
with old friends?

352
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:48,549
[LUKA] Well, sadly,
I really haven't got the time.

353
00:16:48,591 --> 00:16:50,092
If you're back
to being yourself,

354
00:16:50,134 --> 00:16:51,594
atone for your crimes.

355
00:16:51,636 --> 00:16:54,639
They'll probably go light,
all things considered.

356
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:58,392
I may be me again, but I can't
make my crimes go away.

357
00:16:58,434 --> 00:17:01,187
I've done unforgivable things.

358
00:17:01,229 --> 00:17:02,188
You're wrong!

359
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:03,773
That wasn't you!

360
00:17:03,814 --> 00:17:05,942
[LUKA]
I'm not wrong, Ichinose.

361
00:17:05,983 --> 00:17:07,944
It's the honest truth.

362
00:17:07,985 --> 00:17:09,987
I'll carry the burden
of my crimes.

363
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:14,033
I don't expect anyone else
to take the weight on for me.

364
00:17:14,075 --> 00:17:15,868
[ICHINOSE]
Not even your partner?

365
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:18,037
[LUKA]
My ex‐partner.

366
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:22,625
You've got one, and he's
almost too good for you.

367
00:17:22,667 --> 00:17:25,253
Listen, Luka,
I know how you are.

368
00:17:25,294 --> 00:17:27,171
This is for Nijo.

369
00:17:27,213 --> 00:17:30,383
You think if you're arrested,
it'll cause trouble for him.

370
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:33,928
I'm only doing this for myself.

371
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:36,180
[ICHINOSE] You'll be crushed
under the weight of it.

372
00:17:36,222 --> 00:17:39,016
That isn't true, Ichinose.

373
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:41,018
All of you were here for me.

374
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:43,312
Wanting me to find my justice.

375
00:17:43,354 --> 00:17:46,649
Knowing that is enough
to keep me alive.

376
00:17:46,691 --> 00:17:49,026
[ICHINOSE] You're talking about
a life of never‐ending sorrow

377
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:50,403
and pain and regret!

378
00:17:50,444 --> 00:17:52,655
You'll get nothing,
and that is not okay!

379
00:17:52,697 --> 00:17:56,534
Not now! You finally,
finally made it back!

380
00:17:56,576 --> 00:17:58,619
[LUKA]
No. I was rewarded.

381
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:01,414
With him.

382
00:18:01,455 --> 00:18:03,457
One great officer was born.

383
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:05,126
That's good enough for me.

384
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:06,460
I'm grateful.

385
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:11,173
[ICHINOSE] Have you decided
on your next job?

386
00:18:11,215 --> 00:18:12,717
[LUKA]
No idea.

387
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:15,386
But I'll find my own cause,
and I'll stick to it.

388
00:18:15,428 --> 00:18:17,305
That much, I do know.

389
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:20,433
[ICHINOSE] How will that
compare to a cop's justice?

390
00:18:20,474 --> 00:18:23,686
[LUKA] Oh, it's similar,
but it's not quite the same.

391
00:18:23,728 --> 00:18:27,565
All I know is, it's what's
right for me right now.

392
00:18:27,607 --> 00:18:30,109
Ah.

393
00:18:30,151 --> 00:18:32,612
See you 'round.

394
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:36,198
[LUKA]
Hm. Yeah, sure, see ya.

395
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:40,953
Oh, that's right.

396
00:18:40,995 --> 00:18:43,372
You can see through any lie.

397
00:18:43,414 --> 00:18:45,625
[ICHINOSE]
I wish I couldn't sometimes.

398
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:49,170
You never were any good
at lying, you know.

399
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:50,588
[LUKA chuckles]

400
00:18:52,465 --> 00:18:55,343
You were a wonderful officer,
Detective Mizuma.

401
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:57,470
Goodbye.

402
00:18:57,511 --> 00:19:01,223
It was a great honor to work
with you, Detective.

403
00:19:17,198 --> 00:19:19,617
[NIJO panting]

404
00:19:19,659 --> 00:19:20,868
Ichinose!

405
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:22,244
Where is my brother?

406
00:19:22,286 --> 00:19:24,080
Or‐‐Mizuma?

407
00:19:24,121 --> 00:19:26,707
[ICHINOSE] He's gone.
Vanished into thin air.

408
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:29,418
[ICHINOSE]
He did it for you.

409
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:31,379
Yes, I realize that, okay?

410
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:34,256
Of course I do, but I just....

411
00:19:34,298 --> 00:19:37,134
[ICHINOSE] I get it, but you'd
do the same in his place.

412
00:19:38,803 --> 00:19:41,013
You two brothers
are the real deal.

413
00:19:45,059 --> 00:19:47,061
Let's go.

414
00:19:47,103 --> 00:19:50,314
[ICHINOSE sighs]
Yeah, sure thing.

415
00:19:56,821 --> 00:19:58,948
[NANATSUKI] It's hard
to believe that Tokyo‐‐

416
00:19:58,989 --> 00:20:00,282
no, the entire world‐‐

417
00:20:00,324 --> 00:20:03,119
may have been on
the brink of ruin.

418
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:06,038
Or that a man called
Warlock was a real dragon,

419
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,124
like the ones from times
past, and he had the

420
00:20:08,165 --> 00:20:10,376
power to grant wishes.

421
00:20:10,418 --> 00:20:12,545
It wasn't that we beat him.

422
00:20:12,586 --> 00:20:16,132
It was that humanity,
as a whole, overcame him.

423
00:20:16,173 --> 00:20:19,135
That's what Ichinose said.

424
00:20:19,176 --> 00:20:21,721
Warlock refuses to speak now.

425
00:20:21,762 --> 00:20:24,807
And, he'll probably
stay that way forever.

426
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:29,228
[NANATSUKI]
No one remembered his words

427
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:32,898
that supposedly resounded
throughout Tokyo.

428
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:36,444
Probably because
Warlock's power is gone.

429
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:40,364
Well, if it keeps things
simpler, that's for the best.

430
00:20:41,699 --> 00:20:44,160
I mean, it was only
a drone to start with,

431
00:20:44,201 --> 00:20:46,537
so if we swap out some parts...

432
00:20:46,579 --> 00:20:48,539
[KIRYUIN]
Will it be all right?

433
00:20:48,581 --> 00:20:50,958
I have to admit, I'm quite
fond of the little guy.

434
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,626
It's gonna be just fine.

435
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:56,213
Also... I'm gonna upgrade it
to fly three times as fast!

436
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:58,424
[KIRYUIN] Don't paint it
red or anything, all right?

437
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,304
[ENDO]
Huh? What'd you say?

438
00:21:03,345 --> 00:21:05,014
[ENDO'S DAUGHTER]
I said I'm going to a movie

439
00:21:05,055 --> 00:21:06,390
with a friend tonight.

440
00:21:06,432 --> 00:21:08,642
So, you'll have to
eat dinner on your own!

441
00:21:08,684 --> 00:21:09,894
[ENDO]
What? Hey!

442
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:11,937
Is that "friend" a boyfriend?

443
00:21:11,979 --> 00:21:13,147
[groans]

444
00:21:23,616 --> 00:21:26,702
[NANATSUKI] We're still here,
just the same as ever.

445
00:21:31,373 --> 00:21:33,709
You'll be leaving
Japan for a while.

446
00:21:33,751 --> 00:21:36,962
Can you speak
English or Chinese?

447
00:21:37,004 --> 00:21:39,715
[LUKA]
Well enough, I'd say.

448
00:21:39,757 --> 00:21:42,134
[BLACK PEARL]
So, that's your name.

449
00:21:42,176 --> 00:21:44,136
It was kind of an odd request.

450
00:21:44,178 --> 00:21:46,806
A name with a "seven"
in it, I mean.

451
00:21:49,433 --> 00:21:51,519
[LUKA]
As long as I have this number,

452
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,938
I'm pretty sure
I can live anywhere.

453
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:55,689
[chuckles]

454
00:21:55,731 --> 00:21:59,109
[NANATSUKI sighs]
Not good. It's too peaceful.

455
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:01,487
[ICHINOSE]
'Cause we took care of things.

456
00:22:01,529 --> 00:22:05,157
[NANATSUKI] I wonder if we'll
be busy again before long.

457
00:22:05,199 --> 00:22:06,367
[ICHINOSE]
We won't.

458
00:22:06,408 --> 00:22:08,702
Which works great, since I'm
planning to take it easy

459
00:22:08,744 --> 00:22:09,954
from now on.

460
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:13,290
You've got a long time
before retirement.

461
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:16,877
[ICHINOSE] My current motto
is "less, and for longer."

462
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:17,920
[NANATSUKI]
News to me!

463
00:22:17,962 --> 00:22:20,798
And here I thought it
was "less and less."

464
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:23,217
[ICHINOSE]
So I'm just gonna waste away?

465
00:22:23,259 --> 00:22:25,427
Nanatsuki,
please stop slacking off

466
00:22:25,469 --> 00:22:27,221
and get back to work.

467
00:22:27,263 --> 00:22:28,806
You don't want to be
a failure of an adult

468
00:22:28,848 --> 00:22:30,850
like Ichinose, do you?

469
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:34,520
Dude. He's talking
trash about you.

470
00:22:35,563 --> 00:22:36,522
[notification dings]

00:22:36,564 --> 00:22:39,900
Oh! Hey, we've got a murder!

472
00:22:39,942 --> 00:22:41,360
[ICHINOSE]
If Nine's not involved,

473
00:22:41,402 --> 00:22:44,029
then it's gonna be
out of our jurisdiction.

474

[BELLEMER]
Hmm... Yeah, about that...

475
00:22:46,699 --> 00:22:47,658
[KIRYUIN]
She's right.

476
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:49,952
It would appear that
this is one of ours.

477
00:22:49,994 --> 00:22:51,620
[ICHINOSE grunts]

478
00:22:51,662 --> 00:22:54,290
[KIRYUIN] Warlock may be gone,
but the terrorism he perpetrated

479
00:22:54,331 --> 00:22:57,960
to regain his dragon
power is alive and well.

480
00:22:58,002 --> 00:23:00,963
And there are humans who
don't know when to quit.

481
00:23:01,005 --> 00:23:02,965
We all know how
frightening human beings can be

482
00:23:03,007 --> 00:23:04,508
when they get greedy.

483
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:06,093
There's nothing
new under the sun.

484
00:23:06,135 --> 00:23:07,428
We've got this.

485
00:23:07,469 --> 00:23:09,638
Special Seven, let's move out!

486
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:11,515
Thank goodness
we've got work to do!

487
00:23:11,557 --> 00:23:13,434
It's about time!

488
00:23:13,475 --> 00:23:17,521
I can't say I like it,
but I am a little relieved.

489
00:23:17,563 --> 00:23:20,566
It means it's
too soon to retire.

490
00:23:20,608 --> 00:23:23,485
Belle, you'll gather
intelligence as usual.

491
00:23:23,527 --> 00:23:24,695
You bet!

492
00:23:24,737 --> 00:23:25,988
Shikisai and Gramps!

493
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:28,741
Go find out what the
victim's family has to say.

494
00:23:28,782 --> 00:23:30,326
[BOTH]
Understood.

495
00:23:30,367 --> 00:23:31,493
I'll do witnesses.

496
00:23:31,535 --> 00:23:33,996
Gather accounts of the crime!

497
00:23:34,038 --> 00:23:35,915
And we'll investigate the scene.

498
00:23:35,956 --> 00:23:37,082
[NANATSUKI]
Right!

499
00:23:37,124 --> 00:23:39,376
[ICHINOSE]
All right, let's go...

500
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:40,961
...partner.

501
00:23:41,003 --> 00:23:44,048
[chuckling]

502
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:45,049
[KIRYUIN]
Hm.

503
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:46,425
[BELLEMER giggles]

504
00:23:48,302 --> 00:23:50,346
Ah. Yes, sir!

505
00:23:50,387 --> 00:23:52,640
Partner. Proud to serve...

506
00:23:52,681 --> 00:23:54,183
...Special Seven!
