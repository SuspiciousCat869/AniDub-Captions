320
00:16:53,304 --> 00:16:54,931
And now he's dead!

321
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:58,309
Look, it doesn't
matter what I did

322
00:16:58,351 --> 00:17:00,603
or didn't do that day.

323
00:17:00,645 --> 00:17:02,939
Luka Mizuma...

324
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:04,899
...my former partner...

325
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:13,282
[ICHINOSE]
...he would stop you.

326

[ENDO]
What happened here?

333
00:17:53,447 --> 00:17:55,074
[ICHINOSE]
It's our ride.

334
00:17:55,116 --> 00:17:56,617
Stand up.

335
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:05,084
[ICHINOSE]
Nijo.

336
00:18:05,126 --> 00:18:06,794
I, uh...

337
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:19,473
[LUKA]
Yes.

338
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:21,684
I've just infiltrated the hotel.

339
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:24,186
[LUKA]
Hmph.

[BIWAJIMA snoring]

341
00:18:31,652 --> 00:18:33,696
He's sleeping?

342
00:18:33,738 --> 00:18:36,574
This guy really must
have nerves of steel.

343
00:18:38,075 --> 00:18:39,160
What do you mean?

344
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:40,995
Don't you hate him?

345
00:18:41,037 --> 00:18:42,580
[NANATSUKI]
Uh.

346
00:18:42,622 --> 00:18:44,248
Seriously, doesn't
something in you

347
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:46,167
want to end Biwajima?

348
00:18:48,836 --> 00:18:51,964
[NIJO] After all, he almost got
you killed once before, right?

349
00:18:54,425 --> 00:18:57,511
There are some words
I don't think I'll ever forget.

350
00:18:57,553 --> 00:19:01,974
That he‐‐the detective who
saved my life‐‐said to me.

351
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:05,853
[LUKA, NANATSUKI] I hope
you find your own justice,

352
00:19:05,895 --> 00:19:08,689
and that you'll live
your life with pride.

[NIJO gasps]

354
00:19:11,275 --> 00:19:12,234
[NANATSUKI]
So, I...

355
00:19:12,276 --> 00:19:14,612
I became an officer
like he was to pursue

356
00:19:14,654 --> 00:19:17,698
the same justice he did.

357
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:22,161
I don't want to kill this man,
because I want to be an officer

358
00:19:22,203 --> 00:19:24,789
that he'd be proud of.

359
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:26,248
Besides...

360
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:28,834
If he testifies at
Warlock's trial,

361
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:31,170
then we'll learn what really
happened that day.

362
00:19:33,089 --> 00:19:36,217
And that may be some
consolation to the people.

363
00:19:36,258 --> 00:19:38,761
The ones suffering because
of what happened then.

364
00:19:40,054 --> 00:19:41,722
So, that's why...

365
00:19:41,764 --> 00:19:44,392
...I'm gonna get him
there and keep him safe.

366
00:19:59,115 --> 00:20:00,950
All right. The room's all clear.

367
00:20:04,412 --> 00:20:05,913
Man, you're all banged up.

368
00:20:05,955 --> 00:20:07,123
Wow.

369
00:20:07,164 --> 00:20:09,667
Oh. I, uh...

370
00:20:09,709 --> 00:20:12,461
I got caught up
in all the danger.

371
00:20:12,503 --> 00:20:14,338
I acted without thinking.

372

Y‐Yeah. Where did he go?

[NANATSUKI]
Biwajima!

384
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:17,443
Shit, I figured
he would show up...

Don't talk!
We'll get you to a hospital!

Stop!

Tell me why, Luka.
