Second, which one
is the traitor?

What traitor?

204
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:56,846
[ICHINOSE] One of the hostages
is in league with the bad guys.

[ICHINOSE] Turns out,
that stolen diamond

It's not as if Nine is involved,
right, Mr. Kiryuin?

Not directly, as far as we know,

Of course. Don't mention it.

[KIRYUIN] You sure we should
be on this case, Ichinose?

245
00:11:30,315 --> 00:11:32,859
[ICHINOSE] It just so happens,
one of the hostages taken by

They took him along, huh?

00:11:43,494 --> 00:11:46,289
[ICHINOSE] He actually
volunteered. What an idiot.

All he did was give
'em another hostage.

[KIRYUIN] Do you think it's
possible he's an accomplice?

[ICHINOSE] Nope. I could
tell in five seconds.

255
00:11:55,632 --> 00:11:56,799
He's just not the type.

256
00:11:56,841 --> 00:11:58,259
[KIRYUIN] Why? You mean
because he's a little

257
00:11:58,301 --> 00:11:59,969
too determined to do good?

258
00:12:00,011 --> 00:12:01,512
No, it's more because
he doesn't seem

259
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:04,182
smart enough to do
anything bad. Y'know?

Oh, wonderful.

teach some bad guys
that crime doesn't pay.

Special Seven. Time to move out.

00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:22,992
S'cuse me. You're
a cop, aren't you?

[NANATSUKI]
Yes.

267
00:12:24,202 --> 00:12:26,162
Can you tell us
if help is on the way?

268
00:12:26,204 --> 00:12:29,374
[NANATSUKI]
Ah... I... think so?

269
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:31,417
Well, that's not
very reassuring!

270
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:32,627
Don't worry!

271
00:12:32,669 --> 00:12:34,254
The police are gonna
keep you all safe,

272
00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:35,630
you can be sure of that!

273
00:12:35,672 --> 00:12:38,299
Hmph. Useless.

274
00:12:38,341 --> 00:12:40,009
He sure got that right.

275
00:12:40,051 --> 00:12:42,220
Would you hurry up
and rescue us?

276
00:12:42,262 --> 00:12:44,430
I've never been
good under pressure!

277
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:46,808
[ICHINOSE] It's a military
armored car and that machine gun

278
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:49,352
up top packs a punch. 'Fraid
you're gonna have to hang tight

279
00:12:49,394 --> 00:12:52,272
a little longer, there, sport.

280
00:12:52,313 --> 00:12:54,816
Nijo, what are the
chances you could stop it?

281
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:58,361
[NIJO] I can catch up to it.
I can't stop it.

282
00:12:58,403 --> 00:12:59,737
Okay, option one:.

283
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:02,031
We have some patrol cars circle
up ahead of it and we use them

284
00:13:02,073 --> 00:13:03,533
to block off the road.

285
00:13:03,574 --> 00:13:04,575
No way.

286
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:07,078
An armored car would plow
right through those things.

287
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,079
Probably.

288
00:13:08,121 --> 00:13:10,623
Plan Two: spray special tracking
paint on the armored car

289
00:13:10,665 --> 00:13:12,500
from the air, boom,
our job is done.

290
00:13:12,542 --> 00:13:15,253
The SDF takes care
of the rest, the end.

291
00:13:15,295 --> 00:13:17,297
That would provoke
civilian complaints.

292
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:19,340
Disciplinary action guaranteed.

293
00:13:19,382 --> 00:13:21,301
But I'll still
do it if you want.

294
00:13:21,342 --> 00:13:22,552
No, thank you.

295
00:13:22,593 --> 00:13:26,055
Plan Three: we go for a direct
assault using Bellemer's drones.

296
00:13:26,097 --> 00:13:29,350
If it's military, it'll be
able to evade electronics.

297
00:13:29,392 --> 00:13:31,561
Plan Four: the officer
aboard does the thing

298
00:13:31,602 --> 00:13:34,772
where he causes a commotion and
stops the armored car for us.

299
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:38,067
[sighs] Be serious.
We can't rely on a hostage.

300
00:13:38,109 --> 00:13:41,237
Well, you have to admit,
it's the simplest way.

301
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:43,114
That may be, but won't he die?

302
00:13:43,156 --> 00:13:46,075
Dying on the job means
a two‐rank promotion.

303
00:13:46,117 --> 00:13:48,119
[NIJO] Special Seven is
already considered a gang

304
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:50,955
of good‐for‐nothing punks
and a total waste of money.

305
00:13:50,997 --> 00:13:53,291
Do you wanna make our
reputation even worse?

306
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:54,834
Out of the question.

307
00:13:54,876 --> 00:13:56,711
That's fair. Let's see.

308
00:13:56,753 --> 00:14:00,423
[NANATSUKI] Ahh! It's bad!
One of the hostages‐‐

309
00:14:00,465 --> 00:14:02,675
[MONKEY ROBBER 1A] Hey, wanna
tell me what you've been doing

310
00:14:02,717 --> 00:14:04,344

[NANATSUKI] Hmph.
I'm never gonna believe you.

468
00:20:43,701 --> 00:20:46,120
Yeah? That right?

469
00:20:46,162 --> 00:20:49,999
[NANATSUKI]
It is. So, see you around.

470
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:59,341
[ICHINOSE] That's one
unlucky guy. Poor bastard.

471
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:07,016
Excuse me. Hello?

472
00:21:07,057 --> 00:21:09,643
Anyone here? Sorry to bother
you, but when I reported

473
00:21:09,685 --> 00:21:12,229
for duty, I was told to
bring my things here.

474
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:14,106
Mornin'! We meet again.

475
00:21:14,148 --> 00:21:15,983
‐‐[NANATSUKI] Huh?
‐‐[NIJO] My condolences.

476
00:21:16,025 --> 00:21:17,067
Huh?

477
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:19,028
[KIRYUIN]
Oh, good! Pleasure to meet you,

478
00:21:19,069 --> 00:21:20,237
Seiji Nanatsuki.

479
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:21,489
I, uh...

480
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:23,908
Forgive me for the
sudden reassignment.

481
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:26,243
Unfortunately, because you
got involved with our case,

482
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:29,580
you no longer have a place
in Criminal Investigations.

483
00:21:29,622 --> 00:21:31,916
So, we decided to
take you on, ourselves.

484
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:36,295
But, again, I'm truly sorry.
My apologies.

485
00:21:36,337 --> 00:21:37,296
Huh...?

486
00:21:37,338 --> 00:21:39,465
Huh?!

487
00:21:39,507 --> 00:21:40,966
You're one of us, now.

488
00:21:41,008 --> 00:21:43,052
Welcome, Nanatsuki,...

489
00:21:43,093 --> 00:21:45,763
...to Metropolitan Police
Special Duty Department,

490
00:21:45,805 --> 00:21:48,265
Crime Investigation
Unit Section Seven.

491
00:21:49,517 --> 00:21:52,645
[KIRYUIN]
A.K.A. Special Seven.

492
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:28,032
[MAN 1A whimpers]

493
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:29,575
[gunshot]

494
00:23:29,617 --> 00:23:31,160
No, please! Help me!

495
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:53,891
[ICHINOSE] Next time:
"The Two Investigate."
