1
00:00:18,519 --> 00:00:20,312
But how?

2
00:00:20,354 --> 00:00:22,064
How can this be?

3
00:00:23,857 --> 00:00:24,983
[KIRYUIN sighs]

4
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:31,031
[KIRYUIN] Awfully quiet
with everyone off today.

5
00:00:36,703 --> 00:00:38,789
Good Morning! Sorry I'm late.

6
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:40,415
Whoops. Oh, well.

7
00:00:40,457 --> 00:00:42,876
What the heck are you
doing here, Nanatsuki?

8
00:00:42,918 --> 00:00:45,337
Hold on, where is everyone?

9
00:00:45,379 --> 00:00:46,630
They're off duty.

10
00:00:46,672 --> 00:00:48,340
Seemed like a good idea
since we cleared up

11
00:00:48,382 --> 00:00:50,092
that terrorist business.

12
00:00:50,133 --> 00:00:51,843
Thought it might be best
for all involved if we

13
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:53,470
lie low for a while.

14
00:00:53,512 --> 00:00:55,430
Politics. You know how it goes.

15
00:00:55,472 --> 00:00:57,933
Oh, okay, you mean me, too?

16
00:00:57,975 --> 00:00:58,934
[KIRYUIN]
Yep, you, too.

17
00:00:58,976 --> 00:01:01,645
Heh. Now that you mention it,

18
00:01:01,687 --> 00:01:03,981
I think you did say
something like that.

19
00:01:04,022 --> 00:01:05,524
It's not a big deal.

20
00:01:05,566 --> 00:01:09,027
Well, since you're here, if you
don't have anything else to do,

21
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:10,821
would you mind coming with me?

22
00:01:10,862 --> 00:01:13,824
Oh, uh, no, I guess not.

23
00:01:13,865 --> 00:01:15,242
Great, thank you.

24
00:01:15,284 --> 00:01:18,662
Just think of it as a little
outing or a date or something.

25
00:01:18,704 --> 00:01:20,080
'Kay?

26
00:01:20,122 --> 00:01:22,708
Isn't my superior
demanding a date,

27
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:24,418
like, workplace harassment?

28
00:01:24,459 --> 00:01:26,837
[KIRYUIN groans]
Right, excuse me.

29
00:01:26,878 --> 00:01:30,048
So, um, would you consider
accompanying me today?

30
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:31,550
Sure?

31
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:06,311
[LUKA]
Know what I think?

32
00:03:06,353 --> 00:03:09,231
I think we're both
gonna be good guys!

33
00:03:09,272 --> 00:03:11,483
We'll have the strength
to protect people,

34
00:03:11,525 --> 00:03:14,444
and the strength to fight
for others who can't, too.

35
00:03:14,486 --> 00:03:16,780
We're going to be
men of justice!

36
00:03:16,822 --> 00:03:18,448
Yeah! We will!

37
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:21,368
I'll be one, too, Luka!

38
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:23,328
We'll both get
through it together.

39
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:26,248
After all, we're
brothers, aren't we?

40
00:03:26,289 --> 00:03:27,249
[NIJO]
Yeah!

41
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:28,709
[laughs

42
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:33,505
[NIJO]
Luka!

43
00:03:33,547 --> 00:03:34,798
Kujaku!

44
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,341
You look so great!

45
00:03:36,383 --> 00:03:38,760
You've got to come and
hang out with me sometime.

46
00:03:38,802 --> 00:03:39,928
Yeah, I'm sorry.

47
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:42,681
I've just had so much to do
since I joined the police force.

48
00:03:42,723 --> 00:03:44,182
[NIJO]
Listen to you.

49
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:46,685
I bet you've already ditched
your whole private life!

50
00:03:46,727 --> 00:03:48,019
[laughs]

51
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:50,397
Honestly, you're just hopeless.

52
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:51,732
[LUKA]
Enough about me.

53
00:03:51,773 --> 00:03:53,442
What about you, Kujaku?

54
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:55,402
What? What do you mean?

55
00:03:55,444 --> 00:03:57,821
I mean your future, of course.

56
00:03:57,863 --> 00:04:00,782
What'll you study?
Have you decided?

57
00:04:00,824 --> 00:04:03,160
[NIJO sighs]
That's a secret.

58
00:04:03,201 --> 00:04:05,996
Hey, don't tell me you plan
to follow in my footsteps!

59
00:04:06,037 --> 00:04:07,706
Yes, as a matter of fact.

60
00:04:07,748 --> 00:04:09,207
I'm going to make
a career of it.

61
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:10,834
No, anything but that.

62
00:04:10,876 --> 00:04:13,712
Having you for a boss would
be an absolute nightmare.

63
00:04:13,754 --> 00:04:16,840
Probably. Still, though.

64
00:04:16,882 --> 00:04:19,760
I've always wanted
to be just like you.

65
00:04:19,801 --> 00:04:22,679
[LUKA chcukles]
Well, I'm flattered.

66
00:04:24,765 --> 00:04:26,057
[KIRYUIN]
We're almost there now.

67
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:34,441
[NANATSUKI]
Is this it?

68
00:04:34,483 --> 00:04:36,234
[KIRYUIN]
Yes, it is.

69
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:38,487
Former member of Special Seven?

70
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:39,613
That's right.

71
00:04:39,654 --> 00:04:42,073
Considered killed
in the line of duty.

72
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:45,368
So, was he? Or not?

73
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:47,245
[KIRYUIN]
His body was never found.

74
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:50,624
He went missing in the
terrorist attack nine years ago.

75
00:04:50,665 --> 00:04:52,167
[NANATSUKI]
Nine years ago.

76
00:04:52,209 --> 00:04:53,919
[KIRYUIN] I want to
believe he's still alive,

77
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:57,255
but at this point,
I've almost given up hope.

78
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:59,132
Can you tell me
a little about him?

79
00:04:59,174 --> 00:05:01,426
Like, what was his name?

80
00:05:01,468 --> 00:05:03,637
Luka Mizuma.

81
00:05:03,678 --> 00:05:07,015
Well. He was an
exemplary officer.

82
00:05:07,057 --> 00:05:10,435
He was courageous,
incredibly energetic,

83
00:05:10,477 --> 00:05:12,979
had good judgement,
but most importantly,

84
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:15,607
he was sincere in his mission.

85
00:05:15,649 --> 00:05:16,942
What do you mean?

86
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:19,402
[KIRYUIN] I believe sincerity
is the most important quality

87
00:05:19,444 --> 00:05:22,239
a police officer should possess.

88
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,157
If the force is too proud,

89
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:27,244
people won't be able
to trust them or the law,

90
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:28,954
and that's a problem.

91
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:31,081
[NANATSUKI]
That makes sense.

92
00:05:31,122 --> 00:05:32,624
Listen, Rookie.

93
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:35,877
Humanity invented a system of
law enforcement called "police,"

94
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:39,881
and when it works correctly,
it can be a truly great thing.

95
00:05:39,923 --> 00:05:42,509
To carry out justice
not for rewards or glory,

96
00:05:42,551 --> 00:05:44,219
but for honor and duty.

97
00:05:44,261 --> 00:05:46,972
It's proof of your wisdom
and personal evolution,

98
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:48,515
those qualities in you.

99
00:05:48,557 --> 00:05:51,101
Do you really think
it's that big of a deal?

100
00:05:51,142 --> 00:05:54,604
[KIRYUIN] Yes. I believe
it with all my heart.

101
00:05:54,646 --> 00:05:57,274
And if possible, I'd like
you to believe it, as well.

102
00:05:58,441 --> 00:06:00,193
After all, it's a
vital part of your duty

103
00:06:00,235 --> 00:06:01,862
to control that power.

104
00:06:01,903 --> 00:06:03,154
What power?

105
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:05,782
The one that you
mysteriously seem to have.

106
00:06:05,824 --> 00:06:10,161
One day, the time will finally
come for you to use it properly.

107
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:12,289
Do you mean that
thing that happened

108
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:14,124
at the mall, or...?

109
00:06:14,165 --> 00:06:15,375
[KIRYUIN]
Why? Do you have another

110
00:06:15,417 --> 00:06:17,919
mysterious power in mind?

111
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:20,380
You'll be able to
understand some day.

112
00:06:20,422 --> 00:06:22,757
That's kinda how
fate tends to work.

113
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:25,635
And when that time comes,
that's when you're going to be

114
00:06:25,677 --> 00:06:27,762
forced to make a hard choice.

115
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:28,972
I'm, uh...

116
00:06:29,014 --> 00:06:30,515
I'm gonna be honest, here.

117
00:06:30,557 --> 00:06:33,226
I have no clue what
you mean. At all.

118
00:06:33,268 --> 00:06:35,562
I guess not. That makes sense.

119
00:06:35,604 --> 00:06:38,815
Don't worry, it's fine.
Some weather, huh?

120
00:06:38,857 --> 00:06:42,652
I think even God would want to
take a rest on a day like this.

121
00:06:42,694 --> 00:06:44,696
I hope this means
everyone else in Special Seven

122
00:06:44,738 --> 00:06:47,616
is enjoying their
lovely day off.

123
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:52,370
[sizzling]

124
00:06:55,165 --> 00:06:56,791
[yawns]

125
00:06:58,001 --> 00:06:59,210
[AKANE'S HUSBAND]
You should get some more rest

126
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:01,379
if you're still feeling sleepy.

127
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:02,923
Oh, no, I'm okay.

128
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:05,300
I'll wake up sooner or later.

129
00:07:05,342 --> 00:07:07,969
So, do you want to
hear about work?

130
00:07:08,011 --> 00:07:10,263
[AKANE'S HUSBAND] Hey,
you come home safe and sound.

131
00:07:10,305 --> 00:07:11,765
That's enough for me.

132
00:07:11,806 --> 00:07:14,893
I mean, I'll happily listen if
you feel like venting, though.

133
00:07:14,935 --> 00:07:17,520
Aw, thank you.

134
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:18,939
[AKANE'S HUSBAND]
How's your hobby going?

135
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,690
My post the other day
got the comments section

136
00:07:20,732 --> 00:07:23,068
all riled up.

137
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:24,986
[AKANE'S HUSBAND]
What genre is the novel, anyway?

138
00:07:25,028 --> 00:07:26,446
Well, it's...

139
00:07:26,488 --> 00:07:28,949
It's set in this medieval
fantasy‐ish world.

140
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:31,534
The action opens just as
a certain villainess is about

141
00:07:31,576 --> 00:07:33,536
to come to a bad end.

142
00:07:33,578 --> 00:07:36,373
[AKANE'S HUSBAND]
Oh, wow, that sounds cool.

143
00:07:36,414 --> 00:07:38,708
I've already
lost you, haven't I?

144
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:41,920
But if it makes you happy,
then I am a huge fan.

145
00:07:41,962 --> 00:07:43,254
[gasps]

146
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,932
Are you almost finished, Dad?

147
00:07:53,974 --> 00:07:56,434
Just another three...

148
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:58,937
...two... one...

149
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:01,231
...and done.

150

[sighs]

151
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:05,777
Damn. I really am getting old.

152
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:07,404
I would've recovered
much quicker than this

153
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:08,822
back in my prime.

154
00:08:08,863 --> 00:08:11,324
[ENDO'S DAUGHTER] Just hurry up
and get changed, will you?

155
00:08:11,366 --> 00:08:12,784
You smell all sweaty.

156
00:08:12,826 --> 00:08:14,077
Yeah, yeah.

157
00:08:14,119 --> 00:08:16,121
One "yeah" is sufficient, Dad.

158
00:08:23,628 --> 00:08:25,171
[ENDO] Guess I've got
about another two years

159
00:08:25,213 --> 00:08:27,173
of active duty in me.

160
00:08:27,215 --> 00:08:29,259
Hope we can find another
sniper to take my place

161
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:32,971
before it's time for
me to step down.

162
00:08:33,013 --> 00:08:37,058
Stop sitting there looking
so gloomy and hurry up!

163
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:38,435
Coming.

164
00:08:38,476 --> 00:08:40,395
Mom's gonna get mad again.

165
00:08:40,437 --> 00:08:42,856
We only get to see
each other once a month!

I know, 'kay. I know!

167
00:08:45,275 --> 00:08:47,152

Why did you get into

168
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:49,571
an Elf‐Dwarf romance, anyway?

169
00:08:49,612 --> 00:08:51,990
Not exactly
destined for success.

170
00:08:52,032 --> 00:08:53,616
[ENDO]
Your mother fell for me.

171
00:08:53,658 --> 00:08:54,868
Well, that's really interesting

172
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:56,786
'cause she says
you fell for her.

173
00:08:56,828 --> 00:08:59,581
Damn her! We'll be having words!

174
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:01,708
What are you, two little kids?

175
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:03,626
Oh, also, do you
have the present?

176
00:09:03,668 --> 00:09:04,627
[ENDO]
Uh!

177
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:05,837
You...

178
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:08,339
No, I‐I bought it!

179
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:10,592
Just don't know where I put it.

180
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:12,427
Ugh. Unbelievable.

Hello?

00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:30,153
[AKANE]
Hey, Belle! It's me.

186
00:09:30,195 --> 00:09:32,072
Sorry, this is Ninja!

187
00:09:32,113 --> 00:09:34,574
Come on, you're not Ninja
now that we're off the clock.

188
00:09:34,616 --> 00:09:36,826
[BELLEMER] No, for real,
I'm Ninja right now.

189
00:09:36,868 --> 00:09:38,328
Oh, you're playing a game?

190
00:09:38,369 --> 00:09:39,788
[BELLEMER]
Ranked best in the world!

191
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:41,498
Wow! That's cool.

192
00:09:41,539 --> 00:09:44,459
Wanna take a break?
I thought we could grab dinner.

193
00:09:44,501 --> 00:09:45,960
Kinda feel like
eating out tonight.

194
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:47,128
Sounds good!

195
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:49,130
I'll just head over to your
place around dinner time,

196
00:09:49,172 --> 00:09:50,632
if that's okay!

197
00:09:50,673 --> 00:09:51,841
[AKANE]
Would you like curry?

198
00:09:51,883 --> 00:09:54,135
Or maybe burgers or steak?

199
00:09:54,177 --> 00:09:56,054
[BELLEMER]
Hmm...

Ah! I want some
fresh spring rolls!

201
00:09:58,973 --> 00:10:01,476
Ooh, nice. I like that idea.

202
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:06,856
Ah.

[KIRYUIN]
He's on a date with me.

206
00:10:12,403 --> 00:10:14,447
[ICHINOSE]
Yikes. My condolences, man.

207
00:10:14,489 --> 00:10:16,866
Ha! I had nothing better to do.

208
00:10:16,908 --> 00:10:17,951
It's fine.

209
00:10:17,992 --> 00:10:19,285
[ICHINOSE]
Whatever.

210
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:23,790
[NANATSUKI]
Do you come here every month?

211
00:10:23,832 --> 00:10:26,543
[ICHINOSE]
No. I've only come once before.

212
00:10:26,584 --> 00:10:28,211
[KIRYUIN]
How cold‐hearted of you.

213
00:10:28,253 --> 00:10:30,046
Yeah, you said it.

214
00:10:30,088 --> 00:10:32,715
[NANATSUKI] Did you bring
flowers? Or anything?

215
00:10:32,757 --> 00:10:34,843
No, nothing like that.

216

‐‐I, um...
‐‐Yeah?

217

Ah‐‐!

218
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:41,099
Nothing.

219
00:10:41,141 --> 00:10:44,686
It's just, I've been wondering
what Mizuma was like.

220
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:50,066
[ICHINOSE] He was a cop
who stood for justice. Always.

221
00:10:50,108 --> 00:10:51,484
[NANATSUKI]
Justice.

222
00:10:51,526 --> 00:10:54,070
[ICHINOSE] Well, justice
can mean a lot of things.

223
00:10:54,112 --> 00:10:57,282
I mean, you can have
self‐righteous justice, too.

224
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:59,742
[KIRYUIN] Yes, That's all
too common these days.

225
00:10:59,784 --> 00:11:02,745
[ICHINOSE] But Mizuma...
He did his best for the victims.

226
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:05,373
He fearlessly confronted
the people who committed crimes,

227
00:11:05,415 --> 00:11:08,918
and he refused to
give in to pressure.

228
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,753
And that's more than I could do.

229
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:16,843
Rookie. Give me a minute.

230
00:11:16,885 --> 00:11:18,052
[NANATSUKI]
Huh?

231
00:11:18,094 --> 00:11:22,432
Ugh. I'm asking you to
go so I can speak with Boss.

232
00:11:22,473 --> 00:11:25,351
Oh! Of course. I'm gone!

233
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:30,940
What's wrong?

234
00:11:30,982 --> 00:11:33,234
So, how much do you
know about this?

235
00:11:33,276 --> 00:11:34,986
About Rookie's power?

236
00:11:42,452 --> 00:11:44,871
Huh? Nijo?

237
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:49,792
You know, I really
wish you wouldn't

238
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:54,339
glare like that.
I've got a fair idea of it.

239
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:57,800
Is he gonna be okay?

240
00:11:57,842 --> 00:11:58,801
You know how it goes‐‐

241
00:11:58,843 --> 00:12:00,762
I think that's for
him to decide.

242
00:12:00,803 --> 00:12:03,348
All I can do at this point is
watch over and support him

243
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:04,807
as best I can.

244
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:08,728
[ICHINOSE]
Rookie.

245
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:11,231
[NANATSUKI] Oh, are you two
finished with your meeting?

246
00:12:11,272 --> 00:12:12,690
Yeah.

247
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:17,779
You know the trials
for the terrorist attack

248
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:21,115
nine years ago will be coming
to an end soon, right?

249
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:23,743
Yes. I know that.

250
00:12:23,785 --> 00:12:26,162
I agree with Public
Safety that we need to be

251
00:12:26,204 --> 00:12:28,581
on alert for an incident.

252
00:12:28,623 --> 00:12:31,042
You mean the kind of
thing that happened at the mall?

253
00:12:31,084 --> 00:12:32,252
That's right.

254
00:12:32,293 --> 00:12:35,338
The time that froze up nine
years ago is about to move.

255
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:37,340
It honestly scares me
to think what happens

256
00:12:37,382 --> 00:12:38,591
when it does.

257
00:12:38,633 --> 00:12:41,302
Why, what's going to happen?

258
00:12:41,344 --> 00:12:42,470
[ICHINOSE]
The bank robbery,

259
00:12:42,512 --> 00:12:44,430
Hisamichi Goto's
terrorist bombings,

260
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:46,140
the attack on the mall...

261
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:49,143
Those weren't Nine devotees
just lashing out on their own.

262
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:51,729
They've started to act
with a definite purpose.

263
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:53,356
In which case,
something will happen

264
00:12:53,398 --> 00:12:55,358
at the next trial.

265
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,694
After all...
It's going to decide the fate

266
00:12:57,735 --> 00:13:00,863
and sentence of
Nine's leader, Warlock.

267
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:02,824
[KIRYUIN] They may make
some sort of desperate attempt

268
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:05,535
to get him back,
or launch a terrorist attack

269
00:13:05,576 --> 00:13:06,953
and make demands.

270
00:13:06,995 --> 00:13:08,496
[ICHINOSE] Unfortunately,
there's very little

271
00:13:08,538 --> 00:13:11,457
that we can do.
Far too little, really.

272
00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:14,043
Well, Public Safety
has their eyes on this one.

273
00:13:14,085 --> 00:13:16,045
It's a scramble for credit.

274
00:13:17,088 --> 00:13:20,300
[NANATSUKI] I wish we could all
work together to do something.

275
00:13:20,341 --> 00:13:22,302
We're all on the same team!

276
00:13:22,343 --> 00:13:23,678
I think we will, someday.

277
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:24,846
Oh, yeah? "Someday"?

278
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:26,389
When is that, Boss?

279
00:13:26,431 --> 00:13:30,518
[KIRYUIN]
Hmm? Well, it's... someday.

How're you this old and
still can't keep neat?

00:13:42,155 --> 00:13:44,741
That's... embarrassing

Thanks, I guess.

288

Now, time for me
to grab a bite, myself.

289

what do I feel like today?

Have a good time.

00:14:03,468 --> 00:14:05,678
I'll be borrowing Akane now.

294
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:08,723
[AKANE'S HUSBAND chuckles] Well,
make sure you bring her back,

295
00:14:08,765 --> 00:14:10,099
she means a lot to me.

296
00:14:11,934 --> 00:14:13,269
You!

297
00:14:17,065 --> 00:14:19,901
Didn't expect you
to call so late.

298
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:23,237
Have I ever told you
why I deal in information?

299
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,740
I can't remember
if I have or not.

300
00:14:25,782 --> 00:14:27,158
You haven't.

301
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:30,661
As you very well know,
our world's full of deceit.

302
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:32,622
And none of us are immune.

303
00:14:32,663 --> 00:14:36,417
You see, all of humanity‐‐
including the rarer races

304
00:14:36,459 --> 00:14:39,670
like elves, dwarves,
and vampires‐‐

305
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:42,757
have come to feel as if
we rule this world.

306
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:45,593
But that's only a delusion.

307
00:14:45,635 --> 00:14:47,762
I want to know the truth,

308
00:14:47,804 --> 00:14:50,390
and by gathering
information about you,

309
00:14:50,431 --> 00:14:53,017
I will inevitably
reach that truth.

310
00:14:53,059 --> 00:14:54,268
[NIJO]
Well, then.

311
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:56,646
It's all down in the basement.

312
00:14:56,687 --> 00:14:58,064
Take a look.

313
00:14:58,106 --> 00:14:59,232
[NIJO]
Hmm.

314
00:15:01,943 --> 00:15:04,904
[BLACK PEARL] It's time
to choose, Kujaku Nijo.

315
00:15:04,946 --> 00:15:08,950
Will you succumb to evil,
or submit to good?

316
00:15:09,992 --> 00:15:12,995
[BLACK PEARL] The good news is,
whichever you choose.

317
00:15:13,037 --> 00:15:15,873
It will still be useful to me.

318
00:15:22,422 --> 00:15:24,549
I'm sure it was
right around here.

If you doubt me,

why don't you go get

Then you can use his
ability to discern the truth.

able to tell if I was lying.

This is the power of magic.

The dragons?

I planned to offer
up many sacrifices,

but I got far fewer
than I expected.

Why, you ask?

442
00:22:06,575 --> 00:22:08,536
Because the police took action.

443
00:22:08,577 --> 00:22:11,497
And because
Special Seven did as well.

444
00:22:11,539 --> 00:22:12,957
It's all your fault!

445
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:14,959
Because you responded
so annoyingly fast,

most of my sacrifices got away!

Guess I can't expect
it all to work in my favor.

Regardless of that, it
couldn't be deemed a total loss.
