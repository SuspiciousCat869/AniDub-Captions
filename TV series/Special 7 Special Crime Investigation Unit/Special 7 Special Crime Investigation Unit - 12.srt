I really will.

I'll do it, Luka.

00:00:37,412 --> 00:00:40,165
The detective who saved my life.

00:00:40,207 --> 00:00:42,209
He said something
I can't forget.

6
00:00:42,251 --> 00:00:45,003
I hope you find
your own justice.

Yes. I don't see any other way.

10
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:35,280
[DETECTIVE 11A]
What about that hideout?

11
00:02:35,322 --> 00:02:36,823
[DETECTIVE 11B sighs]
The brass called it off.

00:02:36,865 --> 00:02:38,158
Oh, that's right, they did.

You know...

19
00:03:04,476 --> 00:03:06,478
I think maybe the two of you
should consider quitting,

20
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:09,272
since you both have families
that still depend on you.

21
00:03:09,314 --> 00:03:10,899
What about you, though, Belle?

22
00:03:10,941 --> 00:03:13,193
Well, I'm a ninja
and a homunculus.

I don't have a family.

24
00:03:15,153 --> 00:03:17,906
So, Special Seven is really
the closest thing I've got.

[ENDO gasps]

00:03:20,992 --> 00:03:22,619
You think we should phone them?

27
00:03:22,661 --> 00:03:24,121
I guess so.

28

[NANATSUKI whimpers]
I just can't do it...

00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:34,423
Yeah, I get it.

30
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:37,050
[NANATSUKI]
I mean, it's my fault, right?

31
00:03:37,092 --> 00:03:39,636
If not for me,
Mizuma would still be...

32
00:03:39,678 --> 00:03:41,012
It would have
been better for everyone

33
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:42,806
if I had just died!

That's not true.

He doesn't regret saving you,

and neither do I,
for that matter.

00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:50,856
How can you know that?

38
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:52,733
[ICHINOSE]
Because I'd do the same thing.

39
00:03:52,774 --> 00:03:56,486
If it'd been me, I would've
chosen to save you, too.

40

That kind of justice
is the mark of a good officer.

00:03:59,698 --> 00:04:02,868
Defending the future of
a total stranger is what we do.

Justice, huh?

My job is all about
protecting your future.

48
00:04:16,548 --> 00:04:17,966
[ICHINOSE]
I can promise you this:

49
00:04:18,008 --> 00:04:19,885
If you'd been in
Mizuma's shoes back then,

50
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:22,304
you would 100% have
gone to save you, too.

There's not a doubt in my mind.

How can you be
so sure about that?

53
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:28,685
You mean based on my profile?

54
00:04:28,727 --> 00:04:32,022
No, kid.
It's because I have faith.

55

I don't mean faith in
profiles or experience.

56

I have faith in you
as an officer.

And I believe in who
Seiji Nanatsuki is, as a person.

[NANATSUKI gasps]

00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:44,534
On top of that,
I'm pretty sure

60
00:04:44,576 --> 00:04:47,329
I'll be able to settle things
in this fight, too.

61
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:49,623
[NANATSUKI]
Settle what?

62
00:04:49,664 --> 00:04:51,291
Ever since that case,
I haven't been able

63

to fully believe in my own
ability to see justice through.

64
00:04:55,837 --> 00:04:57,756
To me, I was just some blockhead

who couldn't do a thing
to save anyone else.

66
00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:03,011
But now, I've decided
I want to believe in myself

67
00:05:03,053 --> 00:05:05,597
and try to find that
inner pride again.

So, that's what
I'll be fighting for.

And, as for you,
recover your sense of justice.

you can do, Rookie.

00:08:45,483 --> 00:08:47,986
Do these five points have
anything in common?

160
00:08:48,028 --> 00:08:49,320
[BELLEMER]
Let me see...

161
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:51,781
Oh! At the mall,
a sacred tree

162
00:08:51,823 --> 00:08:55,076
that had been there since
before it was built was felled.

163
00:08:55,118 --> 00:08:56,661
[ICHINOSE]
It looks like an old torii gate

164
00:08:56,703 --> 00:08:59,664
was also destroyed
at the airport.

165
00:08:59,706 --> 00:09:03,376
Boss, listen, these sacred trees
and torii gates and things‐‐

166
00:09:03,418 --> 00:09:06,171
are they the seals
Warlock was talking about?

167
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:07,505
[KIRYUIN]
Most likely.

168
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:09,132
Although, to be honest,
I was never certain

169
00:09:09,174 --> 00:09:11,885
where they were, myself.

170
00:09:11,926 --> 00:09:14,471
So, to break
the seals undetected,

171
00:09:14,512 --> 00:09:15,972
they're committing
terrorist attacks to create a

172
00:09:16,014 --> 00:09:18,433
diversion and
cover their tracks.

173
00:09:18,475 --> 00:09:21,144
[KIRYUIN] Yes, as far as
I can tell from these photos,

174
00:09:21,186 --> 00:09:23,646
they've definitely been
using their crimes as a cover

175
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:25,940
to break the seals of his power.

176
00:09:25,982 --> 00:09:28,151
[ICHINOSE] And it appears
that Warlock did get stronger

177
00:09:28,193 --> 00:09:29,694
with each one they broke.

178
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:36,534
[NANATSUKI gasps]

179
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:40,955
It's a pentagram,
and in the center of it

180
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:43,208
just happens to be...

181
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:45,043
[NANATSUKI]
Police headquarters!

182
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:53,760
[WARLOCK]
Listen up, all you humans!

183
00:09:53,802 --> 00:09:56,721
Fun fact: I am one of
the great, powerful dragons

184
00:09:56,763 --> 00:09:58,932
you worshipped long ago!

185
00:09:58,973 --> 00:10:02,685
I've come back, so,
bow down and praise me!

186
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:03,812
You'll see!

187
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:05,647
Once I kill that first dragon,

188
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:08,358
this will all finally
be over for you!

189
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:10,693
Isn't that right, Kiryuin?

190
00:10:12,737 --> 00:10:15,115
Wait a minute‐‐
what in the world?

My, my, long time
no see, you old fool.

00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:19,536
Yeah, you aren't kidding.

193
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:22,122
It has been a long time,
you whippersnapper.

194
00:10:22,163 --> 00:10:23,248
[WARLOCK]
Accept it:

195
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:26,668
all of the dragons' power
now belongs to me.

196
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:29,420
By the way, why ever
did you forsake your power?

197
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:31,840
See, I think you've
actually got that backwards.

198
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:34,592
I should be the one asking
why you would ever want it.

199
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:36,886
Stop being so ridiculous.

200
00:10:36,928 --> 00:10:39,180
So, you gained
enlightenment like a monk,

201
00:10:39,222 --> 00:10:40,932
then decided vanishing
was the right way

202
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:42,809
for a dragon to go out?

203
00:10:42,851 --> 00:10:46,229
Seriously, have you not
an ounce of dragon pride?

204
00:10:46,271 --> 00:10:49,023
No, I'm afraid that
I haven't got any at all.

205
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:51,067
As evidenced by the fact
that I'm the first head

206
00:10:51,109 --> 00:10:52,819
of the Nine‐ Headed Dragon
and I've chosen

207
00:10:52,861 --> 00:10:54,737
to remain in this world.

208
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:57,615
The truth is, I have
no more need of power.

209
00:10:57,657 --> 00:11:00,201
Well, that's good, because as
the last head of that dragon,

210
00:11:00,243 --> 00:11:03,079
I'm going to take
this whole world.

211
00:11:03,121 --> 00:11:05,039
My, you're a
greedy one, aren't you?

[KIRYUIN] I confess,
I told you a little lie.

00:11:13,173 --> 00:11:15,717
I may be human now, that's true.

216
00:11:15,758 --> 00:11:19,345
But you'll find my dragon power
is still very much intact.

217
00:11:19,387 --> 00:11:21,264
[WARLOCK chuckles]
So!

218
00:11:21,306 --> 00:11:23,725
You're the last boss.

219
00:11:23,766 --> 00:11:27,145
My dragon blood
is seething in my veins!

220
00:11:27,187 --> 00:11:28,271
Why be like that?

221
00:11:28,313 --> 00:11:30,190
I mean, mine certainly isn't.

222
00:11:30,231 --> 00:11:31,858
Maybe grow up?

223
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:33,776
Hold on. You're not human, Boss?

224
00:11:33,818 --> 00:11:35,069
What the heck?

225
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:37,238
[KIRYUIN] I'd bet even you
couldn't see that coming‐‐

226
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,865
am I right, Charisma?

227
00:11:38,907 --> 00:11:42,285
There are quite a few surprising
mysteries in this world

He came out and said it!

229
00:11:44,204 --> 00:11:46,122
[KIRYUIN]
Well, because that's how it is.

230
00:11:46,164 --> 00:11:49,125
So I'd really appreciate it if
you would all come rescue me

sooner rather than later, 'kay?

[AKANE] Is there anything
specific we can do to help you?

233
00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:54,756
[KIRYUIN]
Yes, of course there is!

234
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:57,675
As I'm sure you're all aware, we
dragons tend to grow stronger

the more humans there are
out there who believe in us.

As for the reverse...

00:12:02,513 --> 00:12:03,765
It's also true.

238
00:12:03,806 --> 00:12:06,017
Dragons are very frail
creatures, you see.

239
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:08,937
Even humans can defeat
them if they know how.

[ICHINOSE]
Hmm.

241

[KIRYUIN] It looks like this
will be my last communication.

Feel free to leave
this drone behind, okay?

243
00:12:14,776 --> 00:12:18,154
I leave the rest
in your capable hands.

No, wait! Come back!

So, let's see, we're going
to fight the Nine members

occupying police HQ...

...back up Boss
who's fighting there...

248

...and finally, arrest Warlock.

Right. Shouldn't be
any sweat at all.

Hang on. We still
haven't heard from Nijo.

00:12:34,671 --> 00:12:36,005
I told you before:

Nijo is fine, he'll be there.

fighting to see justice done,

else might've said!

You could've killed me
twice now, and you haven't!

[KIRYUIN grunts]

00:16:08,134 --> 00:16:10,511
Oh, dear,
he's begun to materialize.

317
00:16:10,553 --> 00:16:12,054
That's not good.

318
00:16:12,096 --> 00:16:13,931
[WARLOCK]
I forgot to mention.

319
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:17,643
I have the trash that worships
me backing me up here today.

320
00:16:17,685 --> 00:16:19,687
What about you, old man?

321
00:16:19,729 --> 00:16:22,690
How many people out
there have faith in you, huh?

322
00:16:22,732 --> 00:16:24,192
Six of them do.

323
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:26,861
And to be honest,
I think that's enough for me.

324
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:29,739
[NINE MEMBER 11C] I can't
believe the battle on the roof

325
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:31,282
is still going on.

326
00:16:31,324 --> 00:16:33,493
[NINE MEMBER 11D]
Look, don't even worry about it.

327
00:16:33,534 --> 00:16:34,785
You really don't wanna know.

328
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:36,370
[NINE MEMBER 11E]
Yeah, you said it.

329
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:38,372
We just need to wait so
we can get Master Warlock

330
00:16:38,414 --> 00:16:41,584
to grant us immortality,
and then we'll be all set!

331
00:16:41,626 --> 00:16:42,793

[NINE MEMBER 11D]
Shit! Hostiles!

334
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:49,133
You son of a...

335
00:16:49,175 --> 00:16:52,678
You really shouldn't relax
when you're on lookout duty.

336
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:56,307
I'm kinda surprised,
this place isn't even that big.

337
00:16:56,349 --> 00:16:59,143
Hey, Rookie! He's got
a knife at his left hip.

338
00:16:59,185 --> 00:17:00,478
Come on over here and get it.

339
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,646
[NANATSUKI]
Right!

340
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:03,856
We arrested the five
who were on patrol.

341
00:17:03,898 --> 00:17:06,192
So, you're the last one
for us to snag.

342
00:17:06,234 --> 00:17:07,860
Oh, is that so?

343
00:17:07,902 --> 00:17:10,321
[ICHINOSE] Hmph.
Hey, Belle, there's a sixth

344
00:17:10,363 --> 00:17:12,698
hiding somewhere, go find them.

345
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:14,200
[BELLEMER]
You got it!

346
00:17:18,329 --> 00:17:19,830
[NINE MEMBER 11F groans]

347
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:21,707
[BELLEMER]
All taken care of!

348
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:22,750
[NINE MEMBER 11D grunts]

349
00:17:22,792 --> 00:17:25,086
That's great, good work.

350
00:17:25,127 --> 00:17:28,256
I've already given you
the rundown of the plan, right?

351
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:31,133
Attacker, Supporter, and Sniper.

352
00:17:31,175 --> 00:17:33,803
You three need to make sure
you're at the top of your game.

353
00:17:33,844 --> 00:17:36,138
You're our ace. Don't slip up.

354
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:37,348
Right.

355
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:38,599
We have two objectives:

356
00:17:38,641 --> 00:17:41,811
protecting HQ till the Self‐
Defense Forces get here,

357
00:17:41,852 --> 00:17:44,522
and of course,
arresting Warlock.

358
00:17:44,564 --> 00:17:46,482
But... I don't know
if Rookie and Boss

359
00:17:46,524 --> 00:17:49,485
can beat him, or what Boss
meant about how even humans

360
00:17:49,527 --> 00:17:52,697
could take down dragons.
No clue what that was about.

361
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:54,282
And if we don't
figure it out soon,

362
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:56,325
we'll all be killed in
the line of duty.

363
00:17:56,367 --> 00:17:58,160
That doesn't sound ideal.

364
00:17:58,202 --> 00:17:59,704
Don't worry, Belle.

365
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:03,165
None of us want to die here,
and none of us will.

366
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:05,751
Speaking of which, dragons draw
most of their power from faith

367
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:07,420
or something like that, right?

368
00:18:07,461 --> 00:18:08,629
Apparently.

369
00:18:08,671 --> 00:18:11,591
Heh. Well then,
I believe in you, Nanatsuki.

370
00:18:11,632 --> 00:18:13,384
Me, too, with all my heart.

371
00:18:13,426 --> 00:18:14,468
Same with me.

372
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:17,388
And I do, too, of course!

373
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:18,723
Thanks!

374
00:18:22,184 --> 00:18:23,352
[KIRYUIN groans]

375
00:18:25,062 --> 00:18:27,315
See, what did
I tell you, old fool?

376
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:28,524
Little worn out?

377
00:18:28,566 --> 00:18:30,109
This won't do.

378
00:18:30,151 --> 00:18:32,028
It seems I haven't fought
in such a long time

379
00:18:32,069 --> 00:18:34,989
that my body's finally
showing its age.

380
00:18:35,031 --> 00:18:37,533
Plus, nobody's been
worshipping you.

381
00:18:37,575 --> 00:18:40,244
Well, I don't need
worshipping anymore.

382
00:18:40,286 --> 00:18:43,998
And for that matter, humans
no longer need dragons, either.

383
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:47,001
The fantasy is over, so all they
need now is the conviction

384
00:18:47,043 --> 00:18:48,878
to carry out justice.

385
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:52,131
Oh, justice, huh?
How lovely for them.

386
00:18:52,173 --> 00:18:54,258
Know what their
"justice" has done?

387
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:55,343
I'll tell you what:

388
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:58,346
it's taken over this
entire building for me!

389
00:18:58,387 --> 00:19:00,264
This is the final seal.

390
00:19:00,306 --> 00:19:03,184
I'm going to destroy
every last trace of it!

391
00:19:03,225 --> 00:19:04,977
[KIRYUIN]
Sorry, impossible.

392
00:19:05,019 --> 00:19:06,562
See, here's the thing.

393
00:19:06,604 --> 00:19:08,522
I happen to have
something you don't.

394
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:09,982
What do you mean?

395
00:19:10,024 --> 00:19:11,901
I simply mean that
it's Special Seven's turn

396
00:19:11,942 --> 00:19:13,736
this time around, Warlock.

397
00:19:13,778 --> 00:19:16,030
Or should I phrase
that differently?

398
00:19:16,072 --> 00:19:18,699
Okay, how about this: the one
with the power you sought

399
00:19:18,741 --> 00:19:21,285
above all else is
finally here for you.

400
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:30,544
And he has another power.

401
00:19:30,586 --> 00:19:34,298
One that you could never
comprehend in a million years.

402
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:36,175
I'm afraid that's
my ace in the hole

403
00:19:36,217 --> 00:19:39,470
and the end of you,
young whippersnapper.

Cool!

414

All right, let's keep moving.

415
00:19:59,365 --> 00:20:01,701
Rookie and I are gonna head
straight up to the roof.

416
00:20:01,742 --> 00:20:04,412
You three, try and
hold them off, if you can.

Don't die on us, Shiori!

418
00:20:06,163 --> 00:20:08,499
Can you please
not use my first name?!

419
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:09,792
Your name is Shiori?

420
00:20:09,834 --> 00:20:11,585
Hey, you stay focused!

421
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:13,504
No. Seriously, Shiori?

422
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:15,506
I have no comment!

423
00:20:15,548 --> 00:20:17,800
[ICHINOSE] It'll take us ten
minutes just to get up there.

424

Hang in there, Boss.

[WARLOCK]
What nonsense.

426
00:20:21,721 --> 00:20:24,432
What can only six
people possibly do?

427
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:26,267
[KIRYUIN] For starters,
unlike your worshippers,

428
00:20:26,308 --> 00:20:29,437
these six believe in more
than just accumulating power.

429
00:20:29,478 --> 00:20:32,148
They believe in me
as a person living among them.

[WARLOCK growls]

431
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:34,859
[KIRYUIN] The fact is, the
sad rabble you've gathered

432
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:37,153
wouldn't do anything
to sate my hunger.

433
00:20:37,194 --> 00:20:39,155
A dragon's hunger.

[WARLOCK]
That's fine.

436
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:45,077
I'll just rip your
blasted head off.

437

So long, you old fool.

438
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:49,749
Do it, now.

What's that?

Oh, don't worry,
that wasn't for you.

Thanks, I am.

Well, good.

Special Seven can
win this fight,

even without an
old fool like me.

Your senility has truly reached
new heights, Kiryuin!

You really thought humans
could defeat a dragon?

For murder,

the right to remain silent,
