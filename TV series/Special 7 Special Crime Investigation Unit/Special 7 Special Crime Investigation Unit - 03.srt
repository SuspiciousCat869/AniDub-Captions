[NIJO] We've received reliable
information that "B"

11
00:02:49,628 --> 00:02:53,215
has planted bombs in a couple of
office buildings in Shinagawa.

Um, who's "B"?

They're called
"B," as in, "bomb."

An infamous bomber
who Public Safety

"B" has actually been

They claim it's genuine

Wow, they really
do hate us, don't they?

Understand, this part
isn't verified yet,

aside with ease.

35
00:03:52,274 --> 00:03:55,110
Right, like flying,
turning invisible,

levitating rocks, healing
injuries, halting aging.

37
00:03:58,113 --> 00:03:59,740
So, it can be a lot.

Magic. It's a real thing.

Hey!

If you want to know more
about magic, just ask me.

41
00:04:05,454 --> 00:04:08,874
After all. That stuff is
what was used to create me.

[AKANE giggles]

43
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:12,127
As it is now, only
certain government agencies

44
00:04:12,169 --> 00:04:14,045
are even allowed to use it.

45
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:16,548
If an ordinary human being
using magic has the power

46
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:18,759
to bring down an airplane,
imagine what could happen

47
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,927
if it ends up in
the wrong hands.

48
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:22,679
Although,
bringing down an airplane

49
00:04:22,721 --> 00:04:24,306
isn't that impressive.

50
00:04:24,347 --> 00:04:26,016
I mean, if that's what
you're aiming to do,

51

all you really
need is a missile.

Anyway, if there's going
to be magic involved,

53
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:33,398
Nine is probably involved, too,
since they seek

of the situation?

[NANATSUKI] Well, we've
confirmed that four bombs

have been placed in
these three buildings.

One each in the Number
One Common Building

93
00:06:07,534 --> 00:06:11,496
and the Iyasaka Center Building,
and two in Nakagawa City Plaza:

94
00:06:11,538 --> 00:06:13,874
one on a high floor and
one in the basement.

95
00:06:13,915 --> 00:06:17,043
We've already contacted
the Bomb Disposal Squad.

96
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:18,628
We've mobilized
the local police,

97
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:21,339
and evacuation is proceeding
according to schedule.

98
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:23,133
We have everyone else
except for Belle keeping

an eye on the bombs.

I see.

101
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:28,972
So, as of now, it seems accurate
to say that we have nothing left

102
00:06:29,014 --> 00:06:31,474
to do but leave it to
the Bomb Disposal Squad.

Tell me.

[NIJO] Public Safety received
a proclamation from

a terrorist group
that claims to have

planted bombs
in Nishi‐Shinjuku.

but sending a proclamation

to Public Safety basically
amounts to a written challenge.

119

I don't think they're
gonna leave us with nothing.

the most those bombs

[NANATSUKI] Think we should
head to the scene, too?

157
00:08:40,687 --> 00:08:42,856
[ICHINOSE]
Yeah, it kinda looks that way.

158
00:08:44,441 --> 00:08:45,692
[NIJO]
Here it is.

159
00:08:53,908 --> 00:08:55,994
[ICHINOSE]
What's wrong?

160
00:08:56,036 --> 00:08:58,413
Not sure. Doesn't
something feel weird to you?

161
00:08:58,455 --> 00:08:59,748
[ICHINOSE, NIJO grunt]

162
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:04,419
[NIJO]
This is... a magic spell!

163
00:09:04,461 --> 00:09:05,420
[ICHINOSE]
Be careful.

164
00:09:05,462 --> 00:09:07,881
I don't know what it does,
but it looks like it's active.

165
00:09:10,592 --> 00:09:12,594
Bellemer, analyze!

166
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:13,928
[AKANE]
It happened here, too!

167
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:16,139
‐‐Spell's activated!
‐‐[ENDO] Same here.

168
00:09:16,181 --> 00:09:17,474
[BELLEMER]
Data analysis complete!

169
00:09:17,515 --> 00:09:19,559
The spells amplify power.

170
00:09:19,601 --> 00:09:22,020
Looks like they're meant to
increase the bombs' strength!

171
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:24,147
[ICHINOSE] By how much?
Do you have any idea?

172
00:09:24,189 --> 00:09:25,482
[BELLEMER]
Let's see...

173
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:27,776
Well, by enough to collapse
all three office buildings,

174
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:29,402
‐‐that's for sure!
‐‐[gasping]

175
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:40,413
[gasps]
Wait, what's happening now?

176
00:09:40,455 --> 00:09:43,708
The timer says... 30 minutes?

177
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:44,834
[AKANE]
This is Shikisai.

178
00:09:44,876 --> 00:09:46,544
The countdown on my
bomb has just dropped

179
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:48,963
from six hours to 30 minutes.

180
00:09:49,005 --> 00:09:51,132
[ICHINOSE] The Bomb Disposal
Squad won't make it in time.

181
00:09:51,174 --> 00:09:53,426
Old Man Endo, head back
to where Belle is.

182
00:09:53,468 --> 00:09:54,511
[ENDO]
What for?

183
00:09:54,552 --> 00:09:55,720
You'll need to guard us.

184
00:09:55,762 --> 00:09:58,765
Keep watch for any kind of
interference from the outside.

185
00:09:58,807 --> 00:10:00,058
[ENDO]
Roger.

186
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,559
You've gotta take Gramps' place.

187
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:02,560
Go on.

188
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:04,646
Right.

189
00:10:04,687 --> 00:10:06,648
Well, Rookie,
we're short‐staffed.

190
00:10:06,689 --> 00:10:09,067
You handle things here and
I'll go disarm the last one,

191
00:10:09,109 --> 00:10:10,527
that sound okay?

192
00:10:10,568 --> 00:10:12,654
You want me
to disarm this on my own?!

193
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:14,823
[ICHINOSE]
Hmph. No, of course not.

194
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:16,699
You just stay here and
keep an eye on the bomb.

195
00:10:16,741 --> 00:10:17,909
Got it?

196
00:10:24,165 --> 00:10:25,375
[BELLEMER]
Let me see...

197
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:29,087
Okay, guys, who here has
experience dismantling bombs?

198
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:30,713
I've done it
in a VR simulation,

199
00:10:30,755 --> 00:10:32,882
but I'm not sure if
that actually counts.

200
00:10:32,924 --> 00:10:35,593
I was present when
one was being done.

201
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:37,262
I'm kind of a veteran.

202
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:38,596
[BELLEMER] You know,
you're really supposed to be

203
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:40,223
wearing protective
suits for this,

204
00:10:40,265 --> 00:10:43,268
but to be honest,
they're totally useless.

205
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:44,561
Go!

206
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:48,148
I just sent you bomb dismantling
tools by drone, okay?

207
00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:50,108
What you wanna do first
is use the liquid nitrogen

208
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:52,819
and start freezing
the detonators.

209
00:10:52,861 --> 00:10:55,321
Which one is the detonator?

210
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:57,657
[BELLEMER] The things sticking
out the side are fuses.

211
00:10:57,699 --> 00:10:59,117
See that thing that
looks like a metal tube

212
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:00,702
right there next to it?

213
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:03,830
Spray the nitrogen around
that, but not too fast!

214
00:11:05,456 --> 00:11:06,541
There we go.

215
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:08,418
Now, at least I'm pretty
sure they won't go "boom"

216
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:10,086
the moment you touch them.

217
00:11:10,128 --> 00:11:11,921
[sighs]

218
00:11:11,963 --> 00:11:13,548
Gotta check out the wiring.

219
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:15,758
Use the screwdrivers
to open the lids.

220
00:11:33,651 --> 00:11:35,737
'Kay, I'm moving
the camera closer.

221
00:11:37,739 --> 00:11:39,699
[BELLEMER gasps]

222
00:11:39,741 --> 00:11:40,909
What's wrong?

223
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:42,994
Belle, c'mon, what is it?

224
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:45,580
Generally speaking,
bombers are very particular

225
00:11:45,622 --> 00:11:47,999
about how they
make their bombs.

226
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:49,792
They tend to stick
to the same materials

227
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:51,628
and detonation methods.

228
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:53,379
Yeah, once they find
something that works,

229
00:11:53,421 --> 00:11:54,923
they don't deviate much.

230
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:58,635
Especially since making bombs
is such insanely delicate work.

231
00:11:58,676 --> 00:12:02,055
Hold on, shouldn't that
be to our advantage?

232
00:12:02,096 --> 00:12:03,556
If they're all made
the same way,

233
00:12:03,598 --> 00:12:05,433
they should also be
the same to disarm.

234
00:12:05,475 --> 00:12:08,937
That's right. Shouldn't it
really make our job easier?

235
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:10,521
[BELLEMER]
Yes, it's true, those four bombs

236
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:12,398
can all be disarmed identically.

237
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:15,109
The catch is, it has to
be done in a specific order.

238
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:17,403
[ICHINOSE]
What do you mean?

239
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:19,072
[BELLEMER] They're set
so that if you disarm them

240
00:12:19,113 --> 00:12:21,449
in the wrong order, they'll
all immediately explode

241
00:12:21,491 --> 00:12:22,992
in a chain reaction.

242
00:12:23,034 --> 00:12:25,536
So, if I tried
to disarm mine first

243
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:27,622
and that ended up being wrong,

244
00:12:27,664 --> 00:12:29,624
then we're all basically done?

245
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:31,292
Yep! We die!

246
00:12:31,334 --> 00:12:32,585
[gaspin]

247
00:12:32,627 --> 00:12:34,754
But you know
the correct order, right?

248
00:12:34,796 --> 00:12:36,756
[BELLEMER]
One sec, I'm working on it!

249
00:12:38,675 --> 00:12:43,096
[laughs] Yeah, you know.
I think you're absolutely right!

250
00:12:43,137 --> 00:12:45,390
I mean, dismantling
bombs without waiting

251
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:47,016
for the Bomb Disposal Squad?

252
00:12:47,058 --> 00:12:48,601
What in the world
were we thinking?

253
00:12:48,643 --> 00:12:49,686
Crazytown!

254
00:12:49,727 --> 00:12:51,187
[PUBLIC SAFETY CHIEF 03A]
This is no laughing matter!

255
00:12:51,229 --> 00:12:52,772
On your own initiative?

256
00:12:52,814 --> 00:12:56,025
[KIRYUIN] Well, that's 'cause
the bomb squad wouldn't come.

257
00:12:56,067 --> 00:12:58,653
You brought this on by
ignoring our information.

258
00:12:58,695 --> 00:13:01,531
You preferred to chase the prize
right in front of you, correct?

259
00:13:01,572 --> 00:13:02,907
[PUBLIC SAFETY CHIEF 03A]
Ah! That's...

260
00:13:02,949 --> 00:13:03,992
[KIRYUIN]
I'll tell ya, I certainly

261
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:05,743
don't mind withdrawing.

262
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:07,912
Though, you realize
that means responsibility

263
00:13:07,954 --> 00:13:09,831
will assuredly fall to you.

264
00:13:09,872 --> 00:13:11,040
[PUBLIC SAFETY CHIEF 03A]
So... But...

265
00:13:11,082 --> 00:13:13,042
I‐If they explode, then...

266
00:13:13,084 --> 00:13:15,920
[KIRYUIN] Don't fret,
I'll assume all responsibility.

267
00:13:15,962 --> 00:13:17,130
You won't mind, right?

268
00:13:17,171 --> 00:13:18,756
[PUBLIC SAFETY CHIEF 03A]
Do as you please!

269
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:21,426
[recieve clicks, beeps]

270
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:25,805
[sighs] The human world
is so full of dumb obstacles.

271
00:13:25,847 --> 00:13:28,016
It's exhausting. Honestly.

272
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:32,687
'Kay, time to think.

273
00:13:32,729 --> 00:13:34,230
Not gonna run?

274
00:13:34,272 --> 00:13:37,442
[ICHINOSE] Oh, believe me,
Rookie, I considered it.

275
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:39,068
If we do, then
those three buildings

276
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:40,486
will go up in smoke.

277
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:41,612
Hmph.

278
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:43,948
Also, we'd all be
out of a job pretty quickly,

279
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:44,949
I would think.

280
00:13:44,991 --> 00:13:46,409
[NANATSUKI]
Hard pass on unemployment

281
00:13:46,451 --> 00:13:47,660
and blown‐up buildings!

282
00:13:47,702 --> 00:13:48,661
Hey, Belle.

283
00:13:48,703 --> 00:13:51,914
Have you not found any clues
to the detonation order yet?

284
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:53,166
[BELLEMER]
It doesn't look like the bombs

285
00:13:53,207 --> 00:13:55,209
can be differentiated
by appearance.

286
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:58,129
They don't even have I.D.
numbers or anything.

287
00:13:58,171 --> 00:14:00,673
If it's psychological,
then it's probably

288
00:14:00,715 --> 00:14:02,508
a job for Ichinose.

289
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:06,304
Hah! I think you might be
overestimating me, Shikisai.

290
00:14:06,346 --> 00:14:09,307
Although, I still feel like
something's not quite right.

291
00:14:09,349 --> 00:14:12,810
I have no intention of
placing a wager on long odds.

292
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:14,562
[ICHINOSE]
What, you wouldn't want to die?

293
00:14:14,604 --> 00:14:16,731
No, I would not.

294
00:14:16,773 --> 00:14:18,816
[ICHINOSE] You'll prob'ly
lose your job, you know.

295
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:20,234
You okay with that?

296
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:24,697
[NIJO grunts]
Yes. I don't mind.

297
00:14:24,739 --> 00:14:26,115
[ICHINOSE]
Hmph.

298
00:14:26,157 --> 00:14:27,658
[NANATSUKI whimpers]

299
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:28,743
[ICHINOSE]
What about you, Rookie?

300
00:14:28,785 --> 00:14:31,162
[gasps]
What? Me?

301
00:14:31,204 --> 00:14:33,915
[ICHINOSE] If we fail to disarm
these bombs, we're gonna die.

302
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:37,460
Doesn't running away sound
like a better option to you?

303
00:14:37,502 --> 00:14:40,296
[NANATSUKI] Well, I guess
that's true, but...

304
00:14:40,338 --> 00:14:41,506
[ICHINOSE]
"But"?

305
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:42,715
[NANATSUKI]
Protecting the future

306
00:14:42,757 --> 00:14:46,094
is a police officer's job!

307
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:48,846
So... I'm not leaving
till it's done!

308
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:51,474

little speech, Nanatsuki.

Just look at you go! So proud.

treating me like I'm a kid!

00:14:56,938 --> 00:14:59,899
[ICHINOSE clears throat]
It's time to think about "B."

312
00:14:59,941 --> 00:15:02,735
If you were our bomber, people,
how would you pick the order?

313
00:15:02,777 --> 00:15:04,779
And there are
no wrong answers, here.

314
00:15:04,821 --> 00:15:06,406
[AKANE] Happy to help,
but I don't know how

315
00:15:06,447 --> 00:15:09,450
a crazy bomber thinks.
I'd only be guessing.

316
00:15:09,492 --> 00:15:11,494
Well, to begin with,
all bombers have at least

317
00:15:11,536 --> 00:15:14,622
a little vanity driving them.
That's their thing.

318
00:15:14,664 --> 00:15:16,040
[NIJO]
They're intellectual.

319
00:15:16,082 --> 00:15:18,709
The bombs that
had been planted by "B."

320
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:20,503
Those were all
painstakingly designed

321
00:15:20,545 --> 00:15:22,338
to achieve maximum effect.

322
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:25,133
Right. "Achieve
Maximum Effect."

323
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:26,843
Their bombs must
not have hiccups,

324
00:15:26,884 --> 00:15:29,345
impurities, or
irregularities of any kind.

325
00:15:29,387 --> 00:15:30,638
Which means there
are requirements

326
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:32,390
attached to the order.

327
00:15:32,432 --> 00:15:33,766
Such as what?

328
00:15:33,808 --> 00:15:35,476
Here are Nine's objectives:

329
00:15:35,518 --> 00:15:39,647
mass destruction, mass murder,
and offering as much blood

330
00:15:39,689 --> 00:15:41,524
to the dragons as they can.

331
00:15:41,566 --> 00:15:43,025
Need a calculation!

332
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:44,819
Belle, there are bombs
in three buildings.

333
00:15:44,861 --> 00:15:46,529
What order would you set
them off if your goal was

334
00:15:46,571 --> 00:15:48,364
to cause the most damage?

335
00:15:49,574 --> 00:15:50,825
Okay, I've got it!

336
00:15:50,867 --> 00:15:52,034
[NANATSUKI]
That was so fast!

337
00:15:52,076 --> 00:15:53,494
Well, I am a ninja!

338
00:15:53,536 --> 00:15:55,079
It would almost
completely destroy

339
00:15:55,121 --> 00:15:56,581
the whole area?

340
00:15:56,622 --> 00:16:00,209
So it's me, Nijo, Shikisai,
and finally, Rookie, yeah?

341
00:16:00,251 --> 00:16:02,712
Let's just pray
we got this is right.

342
00:16:02,753 --> 00:16:04,589
Belle, I need directions.

343
00:16:09,469 --> 00:16:10,928
[BELLEMER]
That wire right there.

344
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:13,347
Yes, that's it!
You wanna cut that one.

345
00:16:16,434 --> 00:16:17,685
[sighs]

346
00:16:17,727 --> 00:16:20,104
[AKANE] It looks like
we got the order right.

347
00:16:20,146 --> 00:16:22,023
Well, I'm up next.

348
00:16:22,064 --> 00:16:24,692
Cool. I'll head upstairs.

349
00:16:24,734 --> 00:16:26,360
[BELLEMER]
The elevator isn't working.

350
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:28,571
Will you be okay
taking the stairs?

351
00:16:28,613 --> 00:16:30,239
[ICHINOSE]
Won't pretend it doesn't suck,

352
00:16:30,281 --> 00:16:31,991
but I've got no choice.

353
00:16:32,033 --> 00:16:35,077
Don't touch anything until I get
there, do you hear me, Rookie?!

354
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:36,120
Right!

355
00:16:36,162 --> 00:16:37,121
What the‐‐?

356
00:16:37,163 --> 00:16:39,790
Oh, no! The countdown
is speeding up!

357
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:41,876
Hurry!

358
00:16:41,918 --> 00:16:43,169
[MYSTERIOUS MAN]
Pitfalls are often found

359
00:16:43,211 --> 00:16:45,588
right where you least
anticipate them.

360
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:48,508
Our schedule's a little
tighter than expected.

361
00:16:48,549 --> 00:16:50,718
I know it's
your greatest masterpiece,

362
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,595
but I've taken the liberty
of speeding things up

363
00:16:52,637 --> 00:16:54,388
just a little bit.

364
00:16:56,933 --> 00:16:58,142
[MYSTERIOUS MAN]
Now.

365
00:16:58,184 --> 00:17:01,312
Annihilation? Or devastation?

366
00:17:01,354 --> 00:17:04,106
[BELLEMER]
Yeah, okay, cut that wire!

367
00:17:04,148 --> 00:17:06,108
[sighs]

368
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:09,362
[ICHINOSE panting]
Rookie, get out of here now!

369
00:17:09,403 --> 00:17:11,572
[NANATSUKI] No! I'm helping
you disarm the bomb!

370
00:17:11,614 --> 00:17:12,740
This is all their fault!

371
00:17:12,782 --> 00:17:14,825
Stupid Public Safety and
their stupid decision not

372
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:16,911
to send the stupid Bomb Squad!

373
00:17:16,953 --> 00:17:18,788
I won't run!

374
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:20,081
[ICHINOSE growls]

375
00:17:20,122 --> 00:17:22,291
I don't know why,
but I've got the feeling

376
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:24,460
I can't leave now.

377
00:17:24,502 --> 00:17:28,965
We just‐‐ We need to disarm this
bomb as soon as we possibly can.

378
00:17:29,006 --> 00:17:31,133
You think?

379
00:17:31,175 --> 00:17:33,344
[ICHINOSE] Yeah, I've got
a weird feeling, too.

380
00:17:33,386 --> 00:17:35,638
There's some other factor
we don't know about yet.

381
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:36,639
I don't know what it is.

382
00:17:36,681 --> 00:17:40,434
But that's gotta be why
the countdown sped up.

383
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:42,353
[NANATSUKI] Police are
the last line of defense!

384
00:17:42,395 --> 00:17:44,564
The key to
protecting the future!

385
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:45,898
[ICHINOSE panting]

386
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:47,650
That's why I won't run away!

387
00:17:47,692 --> 00:17:49,777
Listen, Belle, start talking
the Rookie through it!

388
00:17:49,819 --> 00:17:52,363
‐‐Now!
‐‐Got it! Right away!

389
00:17:52,405 --> 00:17:56,534
[ICHINOSE pantin]

390
00:18:00,121 --> 00:18:01,831
Belle! What's the next step?

391
00:18:01,872 --> 00:18:03,666
[BELLEMER] But, there's
only three minutes left!

392
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:04,667
Hurry!

393
00:18:04,709 --> 00:18:07,003
[BELLEMER] Yes, okay!
So, there are ten wires!

394
00:18:07,044 --> 00:18:09,630
You need to cut five of
them in a specific order!

395
00:18:09,672 --> 00:18:11,299
First! Yellow!

396
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:13,092
[NANATSUKI]
I saw this three times.

397
00:18:13,134 --> 00:18:14,468
I remember!

398
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:15,928
Heh.

399
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:17,805
[BELLEMER]
Stop‐‐no! You have to slow down!

400
00:18:17,847 --> 00:18:21,100
You can't rush ahead!
Some of them are the same color!

401
00:18:21,142 --> 00:18:22,226
I know!

402
00:18:22,268 --> 00:18:25,730
Yellow, blue, red, green, black,
isn't that the right sequence?!

403
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:27,356
[BELLEMER]
Stop! No, that's wrong!

404
00:18:27,398 --> 00:18:29,984
You've got the wrong order!
Just wait for‐‐

405
00:18:34,989 --> 00:18:38,367
[beeping]

406
00:18:38,409 --> 00:18:40,036
[ALL sigh]

407
00:18:40,077 --> 00:18:41,370
[ENDO] All that promise
you were showing

408
00:18:41,412 --> 00:18:43,247
went right out the window, kid.

409
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:45,499
[AKANE] You need
to calm down, Nanatsuki.

410
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:47,209
Seriously!

411
00:18:47,251 --> 00:18:50,379
Forgive me. I guess
I just got too worked up.

412
00:18:50,421 --> 00:18:52,840
Gimme the order again!

413
00:18:52,882 --> 00:18:54,008
[ICHINOSE]
Next is green.

414
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:55,176
[gasps]

415
00:18:55,217 --> 00:18:58,971
[ICHINOSE panting]
Gonna leave this to you.

416
00:18:59,013 --> 00:19:01,223
I'll stop you if you screw up.

417
00:19:01,265 --> 00:19:02,433
Right!

418
00:19:06,646 --> 00:19:08,481
[NANATSUKI]
The next one is the last.

419
00:19:08,522 --> 00:19:10,858
It's not the kind of thing where
it's an impossible choice,

420
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:12,985
like, "either red
or blue," is it?

421
00:19:13,027 --> 00:19:14,487
No, of course not.

422
00:19:14,528 --> 00:19:17,907
Real police work is
never quite that dramatic.

423
00:19:17,948 --> 00:19:20,284
Maybe not,
but it's been plenty dramatic

424
00:19:20,326 --> 00:19:21,994
this time, hasn't it?

425
00:19:22,036 --> 00:19:23,537
[beeping stops]

426
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:29,710
Guys, that was a success!

427
00:19:29,752 --> 00:19:32,505
[MYSTERIOUS MAN] The bombs you
were so proud of were disarmed.

428
00:19:33,631 --> 00:19:35,966
Don't be mad.
It's not your fault.

429
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:39,512
This was simply the best you
could do with your technology.

430
00:19:39,553 --> 00:19:42,890
But not to worry, I'll be using
Nine's power for the rest.

431
00:19:44,517 --> 00:19:47,269
[MYSTERIOUS MAN] Nine's power
is derived from dragons' magic.

432
00:19:47,311 --> 00:19:49,522
Its uses are nearly limitless.

433
00:19:49,563 --> 00:19:51,565
One is to amplify
the force of explosives

434
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:53,609
to an impressive degree.

435
00:19:53,651 --> 00:19:56,112
And by making the spell
run out of control,

436
00:19:56,153 --> 00:19:58,656
it can achieve
the same effect as a bomb.

437
00:20:00,157 --> 00:20:01,992
[ICHINOSE]
What the‐‐?

[NANATSUKI]
What's going on?

439
00:20:04,412 --> 00:20:05,746
[NANATSUKI]
This is bad.

440
00:20:05,788 --> 00:20:07,164
I don't understand
what's happening,

441
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:09,208
but it's definitely not okay!

[NANATSUKI grunts]

443

[gasps]
Rookie, we gotta go!

444
00:20:22,555 --> 00:20:24,557
[LUKA] I hope you
find your own justice,

445
00:20:24,598 --> 00:20:27,601
and that you'll live with pride.

446
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:31,689
[NANATSUKI] Nine years ago,
something changed my destiny.

00:20:31,731 --> 00:20:33,232
Maybe this is why!

00:20:33,274 --> 00:20:35,025
For this moment, right here!

[ICHINOSE] I've got it!
Surely, at this distance...

454
00:20:58,090 --> 00:20:59,800
[ICHINOSE]
I still can't hit a thing!

Hey! Hang in there, kid!

You hurt?

00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:27,161
Talk to me.

461
00:21:27,203 --> 00:21:31,624
Oh, yeah. I think
I'm gonna be all right.

462
00:21:31,665 --> 00:21:35,002
But, did I... Did I mess up
disarming the bomb?

463
00:21:35,044 --> 00:21:37,588
Heh! Well, if you had,
we'd be ash and dust by now,

00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:39,924
so, no, that's not what you did.

00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:52,353
[KIRYUIN] My goodness,
that was a close one.

469
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:54,355
[MYSTERIOUS MAN]
I've failed.

470
00:21:54,396 --> 00:21:56,023
It would appear that they
knew enough to be able

471
00:21:56,065 --> 00:21:57,942
to interfere with the spell.

472
00:21:57,983 --> 00:22:00,110
Which surprises me.

473
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:03,072
However, now we've shown
them what magic can do.

474
00:22:03,113 --> 00:22:05,741
So I was thinking
I'd try that spell next.

475
00:22:07,243 --> 00:22:08,244
[MYSTERIOUS MAN]
Yes.

476
00:22:08,285 --> 00:22:09,829
I'm aware it requires
a considerable number

477
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:11,497
of sacrifices.

478
00:22:11,539 --> 00:22:14,458
I've already identified
several potential facilities.

479
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:17,837
I'll email them to you later.
Goodbye.

480
00:22:20,965 --> 00:22:23,884
[MYSTERIOUS MAN]
It's too late... Special Seven.

481
00:22:23,926 --> 00:22:26,762
The era of human beings
is coming to an end.

482
00:22:28,556 --> 00:22:30,057
[NANATSUKI]
Man, I'm beat.

483
00:22:30,099 --> 00:22:33,269
But, all's well that ends well‐‐
or so they say, right?

484
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:34,687
Excellent work, Rookie.

485
00:22:34,728 --> 00:22:35,813
Thank you.

486
00:22:35,855 --> 00:22:38,399
I guess that means
I've grown a little bit, huh?

487
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,150
Heh. It's good
you can joke about it.

488
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:42,027
What do you mean?
I'm being serious.

489
00:22:42,069 --> 00:22:43,237
Oh, you are?

490
00:22:43,279 --> 00:22:45,614
Well, in that case, I'll just
stand here awkwardly

491
00:22:45,656 --> 00:22:47,741
and try to avoid the
question, like I do.

492
00:22:47,783 --> 00:22:49,285
[NANATSUKI]
What does that mean?

493
00:22:49,326 --> 00:22:50,327
[ICHINOSE laughs]

494
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:51,787
[NANATSUKI]
Don't just laugh!

495
00:22:51,829 --> 00:22:53,497
[laughing continues]

496
00:22:53,539 --> 00:22:55,040
[NANATSUKI]
You're infuriating.

497
00:23:51,388 --> 00:23:53,557
[NIJO] Next time:
"The Four's Families."
