1
00:00:18,727 --> 00:00:21,772
[BLACK PEARL] I had no idea you
were interested in psychology.

2
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:24,441
[NIJO]
That's because I'm not.

3
00:00:24,483 --> 00:00:26,485
Just trying to pick up
enough to get by.

4
00:00:26,527 --> 00:00:29,154
[BLACK PEARL] A makeshift
weapon can be dangerous.

5
00:00:29,196 --> 00:00:31,990
[NIJO] Maybe, but it's
better than nothing.

6
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:34,368
Thank you for the "B" case.

7
00:00:34,409 --> 00:00:37,162
Yeah, well, Public Safety
wouldn't believe me.

8
00:00:37,204 --> 00:00:39,831
Whereas you did, and
then you paid me, to boot.

9
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:42,209
It's as simple as that.

10
00:00:42,251 --> 00:00:43,710
Any news?

11
00:00:46,672 --> 00:00:50,342
[BLACK PEARL] If you mean Seiji
Nanatsuki's history, it's clean.

12
00:00:50,384 --> 00:00:52,469
He lost his parents
at a young age,

13
00:00:52,511 --> 00:00:55,305
so he was raised
by his grandparents.

14
00:00:55,347 --> 00:00:57,641
After the Airport Attack,
his goal was to become

15
00:00:57,683 --> 00:01:02,187
a police officer. His record's
been spotless ever since.

16
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,107
[NIJO]
And the other matter?

17
00:01:05,148 --> 00:01:06,316
[BLACK PEARL]
Yes.

18
00:01:06,358 --> 00:01:08,777
For the past few days,
the dark web arms market

19
00:01:08,819 --> 00:01:10,821
has been buzzing like crazy.

20
00:01:10,862 --> 00:01:13,865
They seem to be buying up
illegal firearms and weapons,

21
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:17,035
dividing them up, and smuggling
them into the country.

22
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:18,412
[NIJO]
How many?

23
00:01:18,453 --> 00:01:20,914
[BLACK PEARL]
Enough to start a war in Tokyo.

24
00:03:04,935 --> 00:03:07,104
[BELLEMER]
So, here's the gist of the case:

25
00:03:07,145 --> 00:03:09,398
Shintaro Eguchi's car
suddenly caught fire

26
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:11,108
while he was driving it.

27
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:13,527
Shintaro only
suffered light burns.

28
00:03:13,568 --> 00:03:15,320
His son, Shunsuke,
who was riding with him,

29
00:03:15,362 --> 00:03:17,322
was severely burned, though.

30
00:03:17,364 --> 00:03:18,949
He's still in
critical condition.

31
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:20,117
[NANATSUKI growls]

32
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:21,910
If you let it
get to you emotionally,

33
00:03:21,952 --> 00:03:23,995
you'll miss the important stuff.

34
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:25,330
I know that.

35
00:03:25,372 --> 00:03:28,834
All right, so what makes you
think it wasn't an accident?

36
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:30,168
Three days before the drive,

37
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:32,796
the son's life was insured
for a hundred million yen,

38
00:03:32,838 --> 00:03:35,298
and 30 mill for
severe bodily injury.

39
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:38,218
And the recipient...
is his father?

40
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:40,387
Exactly. As it happens,

41
00:03:40,429 --> 00:03:42,597
Shintaro Eguchi also
lost two children

42
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:45,100
in an accident two years ago.

43
00:03:45,142 --> 00:03:47,310
And accidents
that keep on happening

44
00:03:47,352 --> 00:03:49,020
may not be accidents.

45
00:03:50,689 --> 00:03:53,233
[ICHINOSE] That's what you're
going to find out, Rookie.

46
00:03:53,275 --> 00:03:55,152
[NANATSUKI]
What, on my own?

47
00:03:55,193 --> 00:03:57,404
I've got a stupid physical.

48
00:03:57,446 --> 00:03:58,905
You're with him today.

49
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:03,368
Happy to work with you!

50
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:06,037
[NIJO] Listen, why don't you
go home, Nanatsuki?

51
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:08,915
Um... I'd like to carry
my own weight around here.

52
00:04:08,957 --> 00:04:10,834
Yeah, I thought you'd say that.

53
00:04:10,876 --> 00:04:12,794
Fine. Follow me.

54
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:15,839
Why again?

55
00:04:15,881 --> 00:04:17,466
Boss's orders.

56
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:20,469
It's an experiment to see if
those two can get along.

57
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:22,053
Wonder if he'll be all right.

58
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:24,473
Nijo's got a notoriously
sharp tongue.

59
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:26,057
Nanatsuki puts duty first.

60
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:27,809
I think he'll be okay.

61
00:04:27,851 --> 00:04:29,227
Nothing to worry about.

62
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:32,439
That rookie's tougher
than he looks. He'll be fine.

63
00:04:32,481 --> 00:04:33,940
Don't you think you should
praise him like that

64
00:04:33,982 --> 00:04:36,234
to his face once in a while?

65
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:37,360
[AKANE, ENDO]
Mm‐hmm.

66
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:39,029
Hell, no. Not a chance.

67
00:04:40,781 --> 00:04:41,948
So, what's the plan?

68
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:43,450
Are we interviewing witnesses?

69
00:04:43,492 --> 00:04:45,243
First, to the dealership.

70
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:47,370
I want to find out what
I can about our suspect,

71
00:04:47,412 --> 00:04:49,122
Shintaro Eguchi.

72
00:04:50,624 --> 00:04:51,875
It's hard not to
feel bad about

73
00:04:51,917 --> 00:04:55,337
investigating the guy like this.
He's lost so much.

74
00:04:55,378 --> 00:04:57,380
Yes, but if he
murdered three children,

75
00:04:57,422 --> 00:04:59,382
I won't let him
get away with it.

76
00:04:59,424 --> 00:05:01,635
We don't know
whether he did it yet!

77
00:05:04,805 --> 00:05:08,183
[GOTO] Yeah, it caused quite
a bit of trouble for me as well.

78
00:05:08,225 --> 00:05:09,935
How many times have you met him?

79
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:11,436
Mr. Eguchi?

80
00:05:11,478 --> 00:05:13,188
We met on three occasions.

81
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:15,941
When he first came here,
when I visited his house

82
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:17,818
with the insurance
saleswoman, and then,

83
00:05:17,859 --> 00:05:19,736
when I delivered his car.

84
00:05:19,778 --> 00:05:21,571
And when you
met with Mr. Eguchi,

85
00:05:21,613 --> 00:05:23,490
did anything
strike you as odd?

86
00:05:23,532 --> 00:05:24,950
Matter of fact...

87
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:28,161
[SASAKI] I understand how you
must be feeling after losing

88
00:05:28,203 --> 00:05:30,580
your children, but taking
out such a large amount

89
00:05:30,622 --> 00:05:32,457
of insurance...

90
00:05:32,499 --> 00:05:36,670
I don't care.
I have my sons' insurance money.

91
00:05:36,711 --> 00:05:38,296
Don't you think you should
use that to improve

92
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:40,924
the lives of you and your son?

93
00:05:40,966 --> 00:05:42,300
How I use
that insurance money

94
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:44,344
is totally up to me!

95
00:05:44,386 --> 00:05:47,848
See, I just can't
relax. 'Cause...

96

'Cause someone's after my
family, do you understand?

[EGUCHI] Don't worry.
I'm gonna keep you safe!

99
00:05:58,316 --> 00:06:01,236
That sounds... unsettling.

100
00:06:01,278 --> 00:06:02,487
I'd say so.

[chuckles]

102
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:10,579
[SASAKI] Yes. Everything
Mr. Goto told you is correct.

103
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:12,789
[NIJO]
Does the insurance policy apply?

104
00:06:12,831 --> 00:06:16,376
Yes. Though an
investigation is required.

105
00:06:16,418 --> 00:06:18,920
I'm told the car that caused
the accident is being examined

106
00:06:18,962 --> 00:06:20,672
at the factory.

107

If you don't mind,

A persecution complex?

Well, if he's
suffering from paranoia,

112
00:06:32,142 --> 00:06:34,936
insuring his kids
doesn't seem weird.

Maybe, but
something's still off.

Look, do you
always talk this much?

all this attitude does

is invite suspicion.

If I were you,
I'd speak up, now.

[EGUCHI grunts]

129
00:07:12,891 --> 00:07:14,100
You both know.

130
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:17,187
I lost two children in
a car accident and I was

131
00:07:17,228 --> 00:07:19,105
awarded insurance money.

132
00:07:19,147 --> 00:07:20,190
Yes?

133
00:07:20,231 --> 00:07:23,526
Of course, it did
nothing to lessen the pain.

134
00:07:23,568 --> 00:07:25,779
Money is no consolation.

135
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:28,657
They were my precious children.

136
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:31,242
And can you tell us why
you insured Shunsuke?

137
00:07:34,329 --> 00:07:36,206
[EGUCHI]
Because he's important to me.

138
00:07:36,247 --> 00:07:38,166
Wh‐Why else does anyone do it?

139
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:41,378
I felt that if I were to insure
him using their money,

140
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:43,338
in a sense, they'd be saved.

141
00:07:44,673 --> 00:07:47,342
Has his condition
improved at all?

142

[EGUCHI]
Still unconscious.

143

He may wake up, or he might
stay like that forever.

00:07:53,765 --> 00:07:56,226
May I ask about your wife?

145
00:07:56,267 --> 00:07:58,561
She ran out on me ages ago.

146

I should say "us."
She left three kids behind.

147

Have you already claimed
the insurance money?

148
00:08:05,527 --> 00:08:10,782
No. Ms. Sasaki strongly
encouraged me to wait on that.

149
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:15,078
Did she? Why, because
you're under suspicion?

150
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,747
She said it was inevitable.

151
00:08:17,789 --> 00:08:19,457
That it was hard to believe.

00:08:38,018 --> 00:08:41,229
[NIJO] Exactly how long do you
plan to depend on Ichinose?

161
00:08:41,271 --> 00:08:43,356
Aren't you a full‐fledged
detective yourself?

162
00:08:43,398 --> 00:08:45,358
Hey, it isn't like that.

163
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:48,570
Though, of course, I do
feel the same way sometimes.

164
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:51,656
Like, he manages to grasp
something I can't.

165
00:08:51,698 --> 00:08:53,241
It's infuriating.

166
00:08:53,283 --> 00:08:54,951
Kinda crazy, right?

167
00:08:54,993 --> 00:08:57,328
Although, he can't escape
being called incompetent

168
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:58,747
at everything else.

169
00:08:58,788 --> 00:09:00,457
That can't be true!

170
00:09:00,498 --> 00:09:02,959
He misses every
time he fires a gun.

171
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:06,588
He also has a weak constitution
and is slow on his feet.

172
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:09,215
He's hardly cut out
to be a police officer.

173
00:09:09,257 --> 00:09:11,843
Oh, so when he makes me
chase after a suspect

174
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:14,054
on my own, it's because
he can't keep up,

175
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:15,555
not 'cause he's slacking off.

176
00:09:15,597 --> 00:09:19,017
That man will slack off
every chance he gets.

177
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:20,435
That's good to know.

178
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:24,898
[NIJO]
Nanastsuki.

179
00:09:24,939 --> 00:09:28,234
You shouldn't put too much
faith in Detective Ichinose.

180
00:09:28,276 --> 00:09:29,444
Huh?

181
00:09:29,486 --> 00:09:32,280
[NIJO] He's quite capable
of sacrificing a partner

182
00:09:32,322 --> 00:09:35,742
if it saves his
own skin, anyway.

183
00:09:35,784 --> 00:09:38,286
Um, why do you say that?

184
00:09:38,328 --> 00:09:40,663
[NIJO grunts, sighs]

185
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:42,499
Forget I mentioned it.

186
00:09:44,042 --> 00:09:47,629
Next up, the hospital where
Shunsuke is being treated.

187
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:48,713
Come on.

188
00:09:48,755 --> 00:09:50,548
Right. Coming.

189
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:53,635
[BELLEMER]
Hmm... I think something is off.

190
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:55,011
What's the matter?

191
00:09:55,053 --> 00:09:57,847
Well, it looks like there are
two weird parts in the car.

192
00:09:57,889 --> 00:09:59,390
Let me see.

193
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:01,392
[BELLEMER] It's like the
battery has burned up,

194
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:04,270
starting from this part
right here. Which means...

195
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:06,272
...that thing's
an incendiary device.

196
00:10:06,314 --> 00:10:09,234
And that means this is
definitely a criminal case.

197
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:11,778
Just our luck.

198
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:14,155
[NANATSUKI] Are we going
to check on Shunsuke?

199
00:10:14,197 --> 00:10:16,616
[NIJO] There's no need to.
First things first.

200
00:10:16,658 --> 00:10:20,120
We're going to ask his doctors
if he shows any signs of abuse.

201
00:10:20,161 --> 00:10:21,538
Do you really think...?

202
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:25,416
If he does, it will establish
Mr. Eguchi's motive.

203
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:29,003
Some parents really do despise
their children, you know.

204
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:31,464
He didn't seem like
that kind of person to me.

205
00:10:33,174 --> 00:10:35,468
[NIJO sighs] And would you
decide he was the culprit

206
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:36,553
if he did?

207
00:10:36,594 --> 00:10:39,097
It was just
an impression, that's all.

208
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:41,891
[NIJO] I want you to listen
and never forget this:

209
00:10:41,933 --> 00:10:43,601
The culprit could be anyone.

210
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:46,896
Regardless of race, sex,
class, or any other factor,

211
00:10:46,938 --> 00:10:48,773
crimes are committed
and criminals emerge

212
00:10:48,815 --> 00:10:51,109
in every corner of society.

213
00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:53,653
So the only sure way
to identify a criminal

214
00:10:53,695 --> 00:10:56,072
is to gather evidence.

215
00:10:56,114 --> 00:10:58,074
You're right. I'm sorry.

216
00:10:58,116 --> 00:11:01,369
Changed my mind,
go check on Shunsuke.

217
00:11:01,411 --> 00:11:04,414
Go ahead.
I'll speak with the doctors.

218
00:11:04,455 --> 00:11:05,915
Okay.

219
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:13,131
[NIJO]
This won't do.

220

[knocking]

221

[NANATSUKI]
This looks like the right room.

222
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:27,145
Don't worry. We'll arrest
whoever did this to you.

223
00:11:27,187 --> 00:11:29,814
I swear they won't
hurt anybody else.

224
00:11:29,856 --> 00:11:31,649
I mean... I'm just a rookie,

225
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:33,359
but there are
people helping me.

226

[heart monitor beeping]

[NANATSUKI]
Hey, that's strange.

228
00:11:37,614 --> 00:11:39,324
Where are the doctors?

229
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:42,744

[yells]

237
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:11,814
[DOCTOR 4A] It appears
you sprained your ankle

238
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:12,857
when you landed.

239
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:14,234
Yes!

240
00:12:14,275 --> 00:12:15,735
[DOCTOR 4A]
That's all, though.

241
00:12:15,777 --> 00:12:17,320
Thanks for all your help!

242
00:12:21,074 --> 00:12:22,951
Well, I'm glad you're all right.

243
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:25,328
Fortunately, I don't break easy.

244
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:28,915
Thankfully, the explosion
was confined to that room.

245
00:12:28,957 --> 00:12:32,669
That being the case. Shunsuke's
been moved to another one.

246
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:35,797
According to Bellemer,
whoever made this device,

247
00:12:35,838 --> 00:12:37,882
made the other one, too.

248
00:12:37,924 --> 00:12:39,801
But how could she tell that?

249
00:12:39,842 --> 00:12:42,470
The parts they used
conformed to the same standards.

250
00:12:42,512 --> 00:12:44,889
See. Engineers of
this type tend to use

251
00:12:44,931 --> 00:12:48,309
the same basic components
whenever they work.

252
00:12:48,351 --> 00:12:51,354
Right, like back
in the "B" case.

Those two children who died.

They weren't
Shintaro Eguchi's children.

00:13:02,407 --> 00:13:03,825
What?

260
00:13:09,414 --> 00:13:10,873
Why didn't you tell us?

261
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:12,542
The children who died
in the accident weren't

262
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:14,168
related to you by blood?

263
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:17,297
[grunts]
I didn't want to believe it.

264
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:19,340
I found out after they died.

265
00:13:19,382 --> 00:13:21,092
[NIJO]
That's a lie.

[EGUCHI]
Ah...

Take a look at this.
Anything seem weird?

268
00:13:25,513 --> 00:13:27,849
Why such an obvious
distance between yourself

269
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:30,476
and the two older children?

270
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:31,894
Because they weren't yours.

271
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:33,938
No, I... I didn't know!

272
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,900
I didn't mean for any
of this to happen.

273
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:40,028
You didn't kill them, did you?

274
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:41,404
[EGUCHI]
I didn't!

275
00:13:41,446 --> 00:13:43,906
I believe you.
For now, at least.

276
00:13:43,948 --> 00:13:44,907
Ah...

277
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:47,327
[NIJO] However, given that
the car you were driving

278
00:13:47,368 --> 00:13:49,329
wasn't defective but
had been fitted with

279
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:53,750
an incendiary device, no one
but you could be the culprit.

280
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:56,210
At the very least,
I think we'd better take you

281
00:13:56,252 --> 00:13:57,712
in for questioning.

282
00:13:57,754 --> 00:13:59,047
It wasn't me!

suddenly caught fire!

That's the truth!

285
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:04,677
[NIJO] So, you had
nothing to do with it?

286
00:14:04,719 --> 00:14:05,928
That's right!

287
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:07,096
And your son?

one surviving child.

[KIRYUIN] So? Tell me,
how do things stand, now?

Just heard. They're
finished with their inspection.

293
00:14:23,488 --> 00:14:26,240
Now that they've confirmed the
car was fitted with a device,

294
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:27,617
they'll announce it.

295

Yeah, and you know,
once they do,

296
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:32,580
we'll have no choice
but to make an arrest.

I just don't think he did it.

298
00:14:34,749 --> 00:14:36,834
Do you think that's
your instinct talking?

299
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:38,753
Or just wishful thinking?

with the two kids?

Nah, that's not it.

reckless with money?

Well, think about his record.

There's nothing in it that's
remotely related to explosives.

I was able to confirm
Shintaro Eguchi's alibi.

He was at his work

Hisamichi Goto.

370
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:58,619
Let's see. Became
a car dealer ten years ago.

371
00:17:58,661 --> 00:18:00,663
He'd been a guard
at a chemical plant.

372
00:18:00,705 --> 00:18:04,500
Before that... he was
an assistant professor.

373
00:18:04,542 --> 00:18:06,294
When I checked
in with the school,

374
00:18:06,335 --> 00:18:09,088
it seemed like a scandal
was covered up.

375
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:10,923
What kind of scandal?

376
00:18:10,965 --> 00:18:13,801
A student was seriously
hurt on an experiment

377
00:18:13,843 --> 00:18:15,553
he was supervising.

378
00:18:15,595 --> 00:18:17,638
And there was nothing
academic about it.

379
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,765
He was having them
mix liquid explosives.

380
00:18:19,807 --> 00:18:21,726
What a great teacher.

Well, yep, that'll
tend to get you fired.

382
00:18:25,146 --> 00:18:27,648
Then he was a security
guard after that?

383
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:30,234
Yeah, and he quit
almost right away.

384
00:18:30,276 --> 00:18:32,528
Is it possible that could
mean he only took the job

385

manufacture explosives?

records at his jobs.

Last thing:

case against the ones used

Isn't that too risky?

The fact that
the child survived?

[ICHINOSE] No, the fact
that he miscalculated.

00:22:49,827 --> 00:22:53,038
Information's
a weapon. A pricey one.

479
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:56,333
In the sense that it can
also hurt the one who has it?

480
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:58,252
Deceit can be a weapon,

481
00:22:58,294 --> 00:23:00,754
just as powerful as truth.

482
00:23:00,796 --> 00:23:02,506
It's up to you whether
that weapon becomes

483
00:23:02,548 --> 00:23:04,842
a peashooter or a missile.

484
00:23:04,884 --> 00:23:07,428
[NIJO]
Yes. I realize that.

485
00:23:07,469 --> 00:23:08,762
I know it's sudden,

486
00:23:08,804 --> 00:23:11,181
but I'm about to
hand you a weapon.

487
00:23:17,688 --> 00:23:19,440
[NIJO]
Location?

488
00:23:19,481 --> 00:23:20,858
[BLACK PEARL]
Unknown.

489
00:23:22,443 --> 00:23:23,652
[BLACK PEARL]
The soldiers haven't been told

490
00:23:23,694 --> 00:23:25,404
where they're going to hit.

491
00:23:25,446 --> 00:23:27,907
It's likely only
the leader knows.

492
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:32,036
Okay, then. Here's where
we're going to strike.

493
00:23:32,077 --> 00:23:33,829
Spread the word.

494
00:23:33,871 --> 00:23:37,708
[NIJO] Even so,
an attack on this scale?

495
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:40,377
It'll be just
like nine years ago.

496
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:41,879
[BLACK PEARL]
Exactly.

497
00:23:41,921 --> 00:23:45,466
Nine is planning to do
something big very soon.

498
00:23:45,507 --> 00:23:48,510
What do you think?
Can you stop them?

499
00:23:51,347 --> 00:23:53,390
[ENDO]
Next time: "The Fifth Seal."
