1
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:21,438
[WARLOCK] Gentlemen, let me
tell you a little about magic.

2
00:00:24,733 --> 00:00:26,193
[WARLOCK]
Magic is the last miracle

3
00:00:26,235 --> 00:00:27,861
we have left in this world.

4
00:00:27,903 --> 00:00:31,281
It can turn battlefields into
wastelands, restore the vibrancy

5
00:00:31,323 --> 00:00:33,158
of youth to
the old and infirm,

6
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,327
and create the kind of
beauty that captivates

7
00:00:35,369 --> 00:00:37,120
all living things.

8
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:41,708
[WARLOCK sighs]
Sad, though.

9
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:44,836
The way it was sealed away
from the unwashed masses.

10
00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:51,093
It's been placed under
the control of the government,

11
00:00:51,134 --> 00:00:53,136
so now, rather than
citizens being able

12
00:00:53,178 --> 00:00:56,765
to utilize that magic,
you are left powerless

13
00:00:56,807 --> 00:00:59,059
and pitifully without hope.

14
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:01,853
So, what do you do?

15
00:01:03,355 --> 00:01:06,483
‐‐[BOY crying]
‐‐[WARLOCK] You know the answer.

16
00:01:06,525 --> 00:01:10,571
If you can't get your hands
on miracles honestly,

17
00:01:10,612 --> 00:01:12,614
you'll just have to steal them.

18
00:01:16,034 --> 00:01:17,995
Isn't that right, my friends?

19
00:01:20,455 --> 00:01:23,000
[WARLOCK]
We need sacrifices and a ritual.

20
00:01:26,128 --> 00:01:29,464
[WARLOCK] Let's drop
our books, take up arms,

21
00:01:29,506 --> 00:01:31,383
and bathe in blood!

22
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:38,223
[WARLOCK]
Flock to Nine!

23
00:01:38,265 --> 00:01:41,101
Become Nine!

24
00:01:41,143 --> 00:01:44,271
That is our destination!

25
00:01:47,524 --> 00:01:49,276
You really think it'll work?

26
00:01:49,318 --> 00:01:51,320
What are you? Some kind of fool?

27
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:54,406
Yes. Of course
it's going to work.

28
00:01:54,448 --> 00:01:56,575
I am a terrorism consultant.

29
00:01:56,617 --> 00:01:57,868
Yes, that may be,

30
00:01:57,909 --> 00:02:00,871
but you do realize they're
a bunch of amateurs, right?

31
00:02:00,912 --> 00:02:02,998
Hey, don't worry.

32
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,125
I made sure to mix
some in with them.

33
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:08,503
[WARLOCK]
Pros, I mean.

34
00:02:08,545 --> 00:02:10,672
[MYSTERIOUS MAN]
I see.

35
00:02:10,714 --> 00:02:11,882
Besides.

36
00:02:11,923 --> 00:02:15,969
However it ends up playing out,
I know I'll enjoy it!

37
00:02:16,011 --> 00:02:18,639
The whole world's in need
of some amusement.

38
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:21,058
Well, here it is!

39
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:23,101
How many are going to die?

40
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:24,895
Shooting for a record!

41
00:02:24,936 --> 00:02:28,357
Now, hip, hip, hooray!

42
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:32,694
Heh. You're not getting
into the spirit.

43
00:02:32,736 --> 00:02:34,571
[MYSTERIOUS MAN]
That's just how I am.

44
00:04:23,346 --> 00:04:24,806
So what you're telling me is,

45
00:04:24,848 --> 00:04:27,184
there was a magical
response detected similar to

46
00:04:27,225 --> 00:04:29,311
the bombing case
from the other day?

47
00:04:29,352 --> 00:04:30,979
[ICHINOSE]
Yeah, Belle picked it up,

48
00:04:31,021 --> 00:04:34,274
since magic is banned outside of
government‐controlled locations

49
00:04:34,316 --> 00:04:36,109
and all that.

50
00:04:36,151 --> 00:04:37,235
That makes sense.

51
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:39,738
Tell me, what do
you know about magic?

52
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:42,407
That it's mysterious, I guess?

53
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:44,826
[sighs]

54
00:04:44,868 --> 00:04:47,746
Magic is actually
dragon technology.

55
00:04:47,788 --> 00:04:51,374
But there've always been a few
people around who could use it.

56
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:55,712
They've made all kinds of
unbelievable things possible.

57
00:04:55,754 --> 00:04:57,464
Widespread destruction,

58
00:04:57,506 --> 00:05:02,928
reviving the dead,
restoring youth, et cetera.

59
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:04,304
It can do anything.

60
00:05:04,346 --> 00:05:06,598
So, the rumor is, the
government always jumps in

61
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,975
and locks it down
as soon as it's found.

62
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:10,060
Hold on.

63
00:05:10,101 --> 00:05:14,064
Are people who can use magic
taken by the government, then?

64
00:05:14,105 --> 00:05:16,066
[ICHINOSE] Well, they're
precious human resources

65
00:05:16,107 --> 00:05:18,235
who can do things
regular people can't.

66
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:22,823
What's up? You have
someone in mind, or what?

67
00:05:22,864 --> 00:05:25,867
Oh, no! Definitely not!

68
00:05:25,909 --> 00:05:28,703
Hey, wait. How come
Belle isn't locked up?

69
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:31,498
That's different.
Boss is her legal guardian.

70
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:34,042
Even the government
can't touch her.

71
00:05:34,084 --> 00:05:36,211
‐‐[NANATSUKI] Wow.
‐‐[phone buzzing]

72
00:05:36,253 --> 00:05:38,755
You talking about
a ninja behind her back?

73
00:05:38,797 --> 00:05:40,257
[BOTH]
No, ma'am!

74
00:05:40,298 --> 00:05:42,759
That's right, boys,
better watch your step.

75
00:05:42,801 --> 00:05:44,427
'Cause I'm a ninja!

76
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,974
Well, anyway,
we need to start looking

77
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:50,725
for traces of magic.

78
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:52,102
Yes, Sir!

79
00:05:54,688 --> 00:05:56,815
So, how do we do that?

80
00:05:56,857 --> 00:05:59,192
Y'know, that's
a good question, Rookie.

81
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:02,487
[ICHINOSE]
I have no idea.

82
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:04,364
What's the point, then?!

83
00:06:04,406 --> 00:06:06,700
[ICHINOSE chuckles]
Just think of it as a break

84
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:08,076
and take it easy.

85
00:06:08,118 --> 00:06:11,037
I'm gonna go take a look at
the map of this building.

86
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:12,205
What do you mean, a break?

87
00:06:12,247 --> 00:06:14,249
You shouldn't be
slacking off again.

88
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:15,834
[NIJO]
Why don't you make him stop?

89
00:06:15,876 --> 00:06:18,044
Holy crap! You scared me!

90
00:06:25,468 --> 00:06:27,137
‐‐[phone vibrates]
‐‐[ICHINOSE] Mm?

91
00:06:29,264 --> 00:06:31,308
[gasps]

92
00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:33,977
[muffled] Ichinose here,
definitely investigating.

93
00:06:34,019 --> 00:06:35,312
Working very hard.

94
00:06:35,353 --> 00:06:36,605
[AKANE]
Of course.

95
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:38,773
Tell me, how are
those beautiful, greasy

96
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:40,317
food court burgers today?

97
00:06:40,358 --> 00:06:42,736
Uh... No, it's actually a part

98
00:06:42,777 --> 00:06:44,529
of the investigation, so...

99
00:06:44,571 --> 00:06:46,031
[AKANE]
I'm on standby, so I'm stuck

100
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:47,782
with instant noodles again.

101
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:50,243
[BELLEMER] Hey, I wanted
to order ice cream earlier!

102
00:06:50,285 --> 00:06:52,203
[AKANE]
No way.

103
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:53,747
Too bad.

104
00:06:53,788 --> 00:06:56,750
[ENDO] You've got some
real nerve, there, Ichinose.

105
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:58,960
How 'bout if you lower
your head a bit?

106
00:06:59,002 --> 00:07:01,630
That way I can line up
a good shot.

107
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:03,840
I'd like some gelato, myself‐‐

108
00:07:03,882 --> 00:07:06,968
a double with apricot
seed and chocolate.

109
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:09,679
[ICHINOSE sighs] So, what,
you're taking it out on me?

110
00:07:09,721 --> 00:07:12,515
[ENDO] Sure am! You got
a problem with that?

111
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:15,518
[NIJO] You're going to be on
your feet for another half day.

112
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,896
You'd better get
something to eat.

113
00:07:17,938 --> 00:07:20,899
Okay, but where are you going?

114
00:07:20,941 --> 00:07:24,194
[NIJO] It appears Public Safety
is operating in the basement.

115
00:07:24,235 --> 00:07:26,404
I'm going to check it out.

116
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:27,572
The basement?

117
00:07:27,614 --> 00:07:30,075
There's been information
about an arms deal.

118
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:32,077
It seems to have
them pretty worked up.

119
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:34,746
They'd have your head if
you were to get in their way.

120
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:37,624
Ah! I'm happy to stay out of it.

121
00:07:37,666 --> 00:07:38,625
[NIJO]
Later, then.

122
00:07:38,667 --> 00:07:40,335
But, um...

123
00:07:40,377 --> 00:07:42,504
About Ichinose.

124
00:07:43,922 --> 00:07:47,175
Are you referring to the fact
that I don't trust the man?

125
00:07:47,217 --> 00:07:48,802
I am.

126
00:07:48,843 --> 00:07:52,263
Don't you find that pretty sad?
That you don't trust him?

Same boat. Heh.

129
00:07:58,436 --> 00:08:00,271
Wait, you really
just figured it out?

130
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:02,941
Nah, but it sure woulda
made our lives easier.

[panting]

132

I know he's stand‐offish.

I mean, I get that.
But I don't know,

137
00:08:14,285 --> 00:08:16,496
I have a very hard time
believing he would just

138
00:08:16,538 --> 00:08:18,123
let his partner die.

139
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:21,126
[NIJO]
Nevertheless. The fact remains,

140
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:23,086
Detective Ichinose
is callous enough

141
00:08:23,128 --> 00:08:25,797
to sacrifice his comrades.

142
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:28,425
It's just... so weird.

00:08:28,466 --> 00:08:31,177
Well, you're free
to believe what you want.

144
00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:34,139
I simply don't trust him,
and I never will.

About what?

It can't be that bad.

Don't wanna.

163
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:52,217
Why not? What's it matter?

164
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:54,427
No way, not a chance!

165
00:09:54,469 --> 00:09:56,304
[BELLEMER] Would you
please get back to work?

166
00:09:56,346 --> 00:09:58,348
Now. I'm being really serious.

167
00:09:58,389 --> 00:10:00,975
I picked up something
magical in that area!

168
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:02,227
Uh, could you
possibly give us

169
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:04,479
more specifics on where?

[BELLEMER]
Are you kidding me?

You mean you guys can't
search a building of this size

173
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:12,028
[ICHINOSE] I mean, we did check
out every conspicuous place

the first four floors.

[BELLEMER]
What about the basement?

We are the children of Nine.

[TERRORIST 5A] Here,
in this shopping mall, today.

00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:05,707
We will perform a sacred ritual!

As long as you do what we say,
you won't be harmed!

It's Nine!

you will not be harmed!

199

A panic would only
make things worse.

We don't know how
many of them there are.

[ICHINOSE]
Don't worry.

203
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:23,224
Sounds like they don't plan
to kill the hostages yet.

204
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:28,813
Although, it's only
a matter of time.

Oh, great, of course
they've blocked all the exits.

Ah...!

210
00:11:44,996 --> 00:11:46,372
[NANATSUKI]
What do we do?

211
00:11:46,414 --> 00:11:48,458
We have guns,
but there are too many of them,

212
00:11:48,499 --> 00:11:51,461
and they have hostages,
so our hands are kinda tied.

213
00:11:51,502 --> 00:11:55,215
[NANATSUKI] I guess so. And with
our phones not working, either.

Yeah, it looks like
they're being jammed.

00:11:58,092 --> 00:11:59,510
[NANATSUKI]
Why would they do that?

216
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:01,763
[ICHINOSE] There's something
they don't want getting out.

No clue what that
might be, though.

Come on. Let's do something!

"Something"?

220
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:10,813
It's more dangerous to act
recklessly than to do nothing

00:12:10,855 --> 00:12:13,066
when lives are on the line.

But, sir. These guys
seem really unhinged!

Didn't you see it?

00:12:17,528 --> 00:12:19,614

I'm trying to!

00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:56,442
[ICHINOSE] Now. He's some
kind of lousy terrorist.

Look, he left
the fingerprint ID on.

237

[NANATSUKI] Maybe he didn't
think he'd be found out?

[ICHINOSE]
Nah, prob'ly just an amateur.

239
00:13:04,701 --> 00:13:07,453
Looks like they're all
communicating via group chat.

This guy's "Wyvern."
Nice name, dude.

00:13:11,249 --> 00:13:13,418
[NANATSUKI] Is that really
a good idea, though?

242
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:17,255
Well, it's a whole lot smarter

243
00:13:17,297 --> 00:13:19,215
than getting together
in one place.

244
00:13:19,257 --> 00:13:20,758
Just gathering
increases their chance

245
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,386
of being arrested, after all.

246
00:13:23,428 --> 00:13:25,471
[NANATSUKI]
But it's still a risk.

247
00:13:25,513 --> 00:13:28,641
If someone checked those logs,
it'd expose all of 'em.

So, what do we do now?

Let's simplify our objectives:.

00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:07,138
Don't let them kill
any hostages,

There are passages connecting
