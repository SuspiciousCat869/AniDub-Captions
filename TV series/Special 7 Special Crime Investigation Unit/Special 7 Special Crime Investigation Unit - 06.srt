1
00:00:13,764 --> 00:00:16,683
[ICHINOSE] Rookie, carry
these guys into the bathroom.

2
00:00:16,725 --> 00:00:19,436
[NANATSUKI] Yeah, sure.
Wait, can't you give me a hand?

3
00:00:19,478 --> 00:00:21,063
[ICHINOSE] Ooh, 'fraid we've
got some important things

4
00:00:21,104 --> 00:00:22,648
we need to think through here.

5
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:24,858
[NANATSUKI grunts, groans]

6
00:00:28,195 --> 00:00:31,406
I'm proud of him.
He's come a long way, hasn't he?

7
00:00:31,448 --> 00:00:32,991
Still a rookie, though.

8
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:34,576
[AKANE] That doesn't mean
you should keep treating him

9
00:00:34,618 --> 00:00:36,870
like a child,
that's all I'm saying.

10
00:00:36,912 --> 00:00:38,539
[ICHINOSE]
Yeah, yeah.

11
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:40,040
So, we can't get
in touch with Nijo

12
00:00:40,082 --> 00:00:42,543
because of the signal
jamming, is that it?

13
00:00:42,584 --> 00:00:44,127
Right, and he's in the basement.

14
00:00:44,169 --> 00:00:46,380
We'll have to think of
a solution without him.

15
00:00:46,421 --> 00:00:48,840
But hey, we've got
Boss here, too!

16
00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:51,635
[KIRYUIN]
Hello, all! Yep, it's me!

17
00:00:51,677 --> 00:00:53,512
Boss, what're you doing here?

18
00:00:53,554 --> 00:00:54,805
[KIRYUIN]
Cheering you on!

19
00:00:54,846 --> 00:00:56,807
Any chance you
could not, though?

20
00:02:39,618 --> 00:02:41,578
[SECTION CHIEF 1A]
So? What should we do?

21
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:43,330
[DEPARTMENT CHIEF 1A]
Isn't this perfect, really?

22
00:02:43,372 --> 00:02:45,540
I mean, whatever the
outcome of the attack,

23
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:47,751
it won't affect the plan at all.

24
00:02:47,793 --> 00:02:49,378
Special Seven?

25
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:50,879
[DEPARTMENT CHIEF 1A]
You think they can beat

26
00:02:50,921 --> 00:02:53,256
the terrorists with their
numbers? It's impossible!

27
00:02:53,298 --> 00:02:54,925
Even if by some miracle
they do clear things up,

28
00:02:54,966 --> 00:02:57,177
it won't matter.

29
00:02:58,512 --> 00:03:01,390
[DEPARTMENT CHIEF 1A] This gets
us closer to our dearest wish.

30
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:04,935
I say we just sit back and
observe for the time being.

31
00:03:06,603 --> 00:03:10,065
Here's the deal: the five of us
will have to make this work.

32
00:03:10,107 --> 00:03:12,401
Poor Nijo. Do you
think he's okay?

33
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:14,611
Hey, it's not like
he's an amateur.

34
00:03:14,653 --> 00:03:16,446
He'll be fine.

35
00:03:16,488 --> 00:03:18,031
[ICHINOSE] There's no point
worrying about someone

36
00:03:18,073 --> 00:03:20,409
who's not here, anyway.

37
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:23,453
[NIJO] Nevertheless. The fact
remains, Detective Ichinose

38
00:03:23,495 --> 00:03:26,373
is callous enough
to sacrifice his comrades.

39
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:32,295
Right. Guess so.

40
00:03:32,337 --> 00:03:34,089
[ICHINOSE] The only thing
that really matters right now

41
00:03:34,131 --> 00:03:36,633
is how we're going to stop them.

42
00:03:36,675 --> 00:03:38,218
[ENDO]
Any news on that?

43
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:40,137
Yeah, just one thing.

44
00:03:40,178 --> 00:03:43,390
The terrorists we're dealing
with are mostly amateurs.

45
00:03:43,432 --> 00:03:45,517
Their posture, the way
they handle their weapons,

46
00:03:45,559 --> 00:03:47,144
their poor teamwork.

47
00:03:47,185 --> 00:03:48,687
Everything about them
pretty much screams

48
00:03:48,729 --> 00:03:50,939
"we don't know
what we're doing."

49
00:03:50,981 --> 00:03:53,442
Amateurs can still
fire guns, though.

50
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:55,485
Oh, yeah, without
a doubt, they can,

51
00:03:55,527 --> 00:03:56,903
but I think they'll
have some trouble

52
00:03:56,945 --> 00:03:58,989
returning fire reflexively.

53
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:00,198
Hold on.

54
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:03,118
I thought these were the guys
who called themselves "Nine."

55
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,995
They can't be total novices.

56
00:04:05,036 --> 00:04:08,165
Nah, they're rookie
terrorists‐‐there's no question.

57
00:04:08,206 --> 00:04:10,041
Or else, disposable pawns.

58
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:11,626
I dunno, they said something

59
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:14,296
about performing
a ritual earlier.

60
00:04:14,337 --> 00:04:15,297
Well, in my mind,

61
00:04:15,338 --> 00:04:19,384
that all but confirms that Nine
is behind this entire thing.

62
00:04:19,426 --> 00:04:22,220
[KIRYUIN] So strange. It's
hard for me to believe

63
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:25,265
they'd go to such lengths
for some absurd ritual.

64
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:31,897
[ICHINOSE] There are eight
on the first floor.

65
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:33,607
Then five on the second.

66
00:04:33,648 --> 00:04:35,192
And five on the third.

67
00:04:35,233 --> 00:04:37,903
It's the eight on
the first that matter.

68
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:39,613
[ENDO] Even if we take
out all the terrorists

69
00:04:39,654 --> 00:04:42,240
on Floor One first, we'll be
done for if the buggers

70
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:44,493
on the other two
floors open fire.

71
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:46,203
[BELLEMER] I guess that just
means we'll need to take out

72
00:04:46,244 --> 00:04:49,331
all 18 of 'em across three
floors, simultaneously.

73
00:04:49,372 --> 00:04:50,707
Like, wham!

74
00:04:50,749 --> 00:04:52,584
It'll take amateurs
about ten seconds

75
00:04:52,626 --> 00:04:55,003
at the very least to notice
and physically react

76
00:04:55,045 --> 00:04:57,589
to a disturbance
down on the first floor.

77
00:04:57,631 --> 00:05:00,217
The game is knowing how
to spend those ten seconds.

78
00:05:00,258 --> 00:05:03,261
"Game"? How 'bout
a more respectful word?

79
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:05,096
Have you ever seen him
show proper respect

80
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:07,224
for anyone or anything?

81
00:05:07,265 --> 00:05:08,600
Words do matter.

82
00:05:08,642 --> 00:05:11,978
If they didn't, we'd go ahead
and call you "Charisma."

83
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:13,688
[AKANE, BELLEMER]
Right?

84
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:16,608
[ICHINOSE]
Mind your own business. Now.

85
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:23,532
[ICHINOSE]
I've got it.

86
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:26,159
Belle and Shikisai,
attack the five on floor three.

87
00:05:26,201 --> 00:05:28,245
You can enter
through the atrium.

88
00:05:28,286 --> 00:05:31,248
Five men.
Well, if Belle's with me.

89
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:33,250
I think together we can manage.

90
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:35,293
I am a Ninja, after all!

91
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:37,546
[ICHINOSE] Gramps,
take the five on floor two.

92
00:05:37,587 --> 00:05:40,131
You know I'll try,
but I can't take out five chumps

93
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:42,259
at once with this thing.

94
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,677
I'll pick up the slack.

95
00:05:43,718 --> 00:05:46,847
I suck at this,
but if it's just backup...

96
00:05:46,888 --> 00:05:48,473
That, I can do.

97
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:49,850
[KIRYUIN]
And what about me?

98
00:05:49,891 --> 00:05:52,143
[ICHINOSE] Get in Belle's
backpack, would ya?

99
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:53,144
[KIRYUIN]
Fine...

100
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:55,397
And me? Where am I?

101
00:05:55,438 --> 00:05:58,900
[ICHINOSE] You take out
the guys on the first floor.

102
00:05:58,942 --> 00:06:01,486
[NANATSUKI whimpers]

103
00:06:01,528 --> 00:06:02,487
‐‐[ICHINOSE growls]
‐‐Ow, jeez!

104
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:04,614
What're you doing?!
What the heck was that for?

105
00:06:04,656 --> 00:06:06,992
I noticed some signs of stress.

106
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:08,118
Listen up.

107
00:06:08,159 --> 00:06:11,621
Here are three cold, hard facts
about our current situation:

108
00:06:11,663 --> 00:06:12,873
Number one.

109
00:06:12,914 --> 00:06:16,793
At this rate, the hostages
will definitely be killed.

110
00:06:16,835 --> 00:06:17,961
[NANATSUKI grunts]

111
00:06:18,003 --> 00:06:19,963
[ICHINOSE] Two: right now,
we're the only ones here

112
00:06:20,005 --> 00:06:21,590
who can stop it.

113
00:06:23,008 --> 00:06:24,676
[ICHINOSE]
Three: as police officers,

114
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:26,678
we have a duty
to protect people.

115
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,555
[NANATSUKI]
I understand that.

116
00:06:28,597 --> 00:06:30,682
[ICHINOSE] Good, because
protecting the hostages

117
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:33,476
is what we're doing.
End of story.

118
00:06:35,186 --> 00:06:38,273
[ICHINOSE] We're not setting
out to kill the terrorists.

119
00:06:38,315 --> 00:06:40,775
[NANATSUKI]
So, don't aim at vital spots?

120
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:44,446
No need. All we have
to do is stop them.

121
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:46,072
Just remember: we're cops.

122
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:49,242
We're not hitmen who
get paid to kill people.

123
00:06:49,284 --> 00:06:53,079
Nor are we psycho killers
who do this stuff for fun.

124
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:54,664
[NANATSUKI whimpers]

125
00:06:54,706 --> 00:06:56,541
[ICHINOSE]
Shoot only to protect.

126
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:58,376
That's what we're called to do.

127
00:07:00,545 --> 00:07:01,630
[NANATSUKI]
Yes, sir!

128
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:05,884
So, then. How do I take down the
terrorists on the first floor?

129
00:07:05,926 --> 00:07:08,219
A‐ha, as for that...

130
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:09,554
[NANATSUKI]
I've got a bad feeling...

131
00:07:09,596 --> 00:07:11,348
Hey, Belle! Ya got one on ya?

132
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:13,725
Seeing as how you're
a ninja and all that?

133
00:07:13,767 --> 00:07:15,685
A ninja's always prepared!

134
00:07:15,727 --> 00:07:19,272
Oh, wait. Got one of what?

135
00:07:19,314 --> 00:07:20,774
Did you mean this?

136
00:07:20,815 --> 00:07:23,151
You're seriously
gonna use this thing?

137
00:07:23,193 --> 00:07:25,195
Yeah. Rookie
will give it his all

138
00:07:25,236 --> 00:07:28,239
and use it to take out
the first‐floor terrorists.

139
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:30,450
That's the whole plan.

140
00:07:30,492 --> 00:07:33,203
[NANATSUKI]
Ichinose, to be blunt,

141
00:07:33,244 --> 00:07:35,538
are you really this stupid?
You are, aren't you?

142
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:37,832
How have you even
survived this long?

143
00:07:37,874 --> 00:07:39,000
Will you be okay?

144
00:07:39,042 --> 00:07:41,294
I mean, I'm sure they'll
be thrown off at first,

145
00:07:41,336 --> 00:07:43,755
but then they'll
target you like crazy.

146
00:07:43,797 --> 00:07:45,382
I think you'll be all right.

147
00:07:45,423 --> 00:07:48,134
The element of surprise
will help you manage.

148
00:07:48,176 --> 00:07:50,053
I'll handle your final affairs.

149
00:07:50,095 --> 00:07:51,554
[NANATSUKI]
Not comforting!

150
00:07:51,596 --> 00:07:53,431
You wanna back out, then?

151
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:55,058
Though for what it's worth,
I really do think

152
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,810
you can pull it off.

153
00:07:56,851 --> 00:07:58,186
Yes, understood.

154
00:07:58,228 --> 00:08:01,481
Okay? I get it and
I'm gonna do it!

155
00:08:01,523 --> 00:08:04,442
[ICHINOSE]
Good. It's 3:55 now.

Guess we should be
thankful it was so weak.

That was a weak one?

if a real one turns up,

Huh? Oh, yeah.

00:19:36,926 --> 00:19:40,179
We'd have been in
a real jam without you.

I didn't do much.

Listen, what did you do?

Would you believe me if I said

343
00:20:01,701 --> 00:20:04,161
I'm not even sure
about it, myself?

344

[ICHINOSE] Hmph.
Well, the case was cleared up,

You look like a
peashooter or somethin'.

348
00:20:16,841 --> 00:20:18,801
Is it possible that
you mean a pigeon?

349
00:20:18,843 --> 00:20:20,302
Well, this ninja
thinks that wouldn't be

350
00:20:20,344 --> 00:20:21,929
very fair to the pigeon.

351
00:20:21,971 --> 00:20:23,556
Why're you all gathering up?

352
00:20:23,597 --> 00:20:25,224
Did I miss the memo?

353
00:20:25,266 --> 00:20:28,477
Come on. Because
we're special 7, stupid.

354
00:20:28,519 --> 00:20:31,647
It's hard for us to shoulder
this kind of attention.

Don't worry about that!

I think your brave
shoulders are broad enough

to bear it for all of us!

kidding, right, Bellemer?

360
00:20:41,615 --> 00:20:43,993
[BELLEMER] I'm sure Nanatsuki
agrees, am I right?

Huh?!

Don't do this to me!

Please! You have to
tell me you're kidding!

Were you able
to destroy the seal?

[MYSTERIOUS MAN]
Without a hitch.

Always in such a rush.

This is no place
for that kind of talk.

Let's discuss it over a drink.
