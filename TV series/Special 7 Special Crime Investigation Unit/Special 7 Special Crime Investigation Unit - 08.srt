Hey, look.

00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:49,487
What do you think?

161
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:51,906
What could be in that cabinet?

162
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:54,659
[KIRYUIN] Huh? Is now
really the time for that?

163
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:57,829
[BELLEMER] Well, it's locked, so
naturally that makes me curious.

Nah, there's no need.

the search area.

At times like this, you've got
to trust them and wait.

That's easier said than done.

If there's even a chance
I can help, I'm gonna go!

Otherwise...
I know I'll regret it!

Have you seen anyone
around here like that?

Sorry.

[ICHINOSE]
Did you find anything?

00:11:05,707 --> 00:11:08,626
Yeah, we got
an email from Belle.

211
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:11,421
She gives a description of
the room she's being held in

212
00:11:11,462 --> 00:11:14,257
Email? I'm amazed she could!

213

Well, she is a ninja, after all.

Email is easy.

215
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:19,804
She told us she thinks
they're keeping her

216
00:11:19,846 --> 00:11:23,016
about a 15 minute walk away
from where the van stopped.

217
00:11:23,057 --> 00:11:25,435
That's still
an enormous area to search.

218
00:11:25,476 --> 00:11:26,686
There's one other thing.

219
00:11:26,728 --> 00:11:28,855
She also gave us the size
and shape of the room,

220
00:11:28,897 --> 00:11:31,816
so I'm finding blueprints from
the nearby buildings to help us

could use those like that!

There's no need to worry.

It will not be pretty
if those men come back!

shouting from upstairs.

experience of mid‐air swimming.
