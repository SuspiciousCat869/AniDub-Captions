1
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:10,719
[SUSPECT 2A]
Detective.

2
00:00:10,761 --> 00:00:13,972
I was talking to someone earlier
and they told me you were able

3
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:15,807
to see through any lie.

4
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:17,768
[ICHINOSE] I can tell you,
generally speaking,

5
00:00:17,809 --> 00:00:19,686
elves are pretty
accomplished liars.

6
00:00:19,728 --> 00:00:22,356
Whereas, dwarves, on the
other hand, not so much.

7
00:00:22,397 --> 00:00:26,610
Exactly, and I've got dwarvish
blood! I don't lie, I swear!

8
00:00:26,652 --> 00:00:28,487
It's the truth!
Please believe me!

9
00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:29,988
You've got the wrong man.

10
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:32,866
Don't arrest me, get the
guy who killed my wife!

11
00:00:32,908 --> 00:00:34,409
[ICHINOSE]
Well, that's the goal.

12
00:00:34,451 --> 00:00:37,538
Speaking of which, I need
to ask you about something.

13
00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:39,748
[grunts]

14
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:42,292
Just a question
about your testimony.

15
00:00:42,334 --> 00:00:45,420
You said you got home
at 5:40PM, discovered the body,

16
00:00:45,462 --> 00:00:48,590
and reported it.
Does that sound about right?

17
00:00:48,632 --> 00:00:50,425
Yes, that's the truth.

18
00:00:50,467 --> 00:00:52,553
Wasn't it... my civic duty?

19
00:00:52,594 --> 00:00:54,846
Oh, it was. Definitely.

20
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:56,306
Heh.

21
00:00:56,348 --> 00:00:57,933
Normally, when someone finds

22
00:00:57,975 --> 00:00:59,518
a family member's
body in their home,

23
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:01,144
they're late in reporting it.

24
00:01:01,186 --> 00:01:03,188
They sense danger
and usually freeze,

25
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:05,315
wondering if there could be
an intruder in the house,

26
00:01:05,357 --> 00:01:07,526
plus, they've got to get
over the initial shock before

27
00:01:07,568 --> 00:01:08,860
they can get their
bearings and call

28
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:10,696
an ambulance and the police.

29
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:12,698
And yet, you called and
made a report as soon as

30
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:14,658
you got home, within
one minute of finding

31
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:19,121
the body at 5:40PM.
Wonder why that is?

32
00:01:21,248 --> 00:01:24,418
[SUSPECT 2A]
It's just... I knew right away.

33
00:01:24,459 --> 00:01:26,044
I knew she was dead.

34
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:27,129
Here's the thing.

35
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:28,547
You have no training,
but somehow,

36
00:01:28,589 --> 00:01:31,049
you just knew she was dead
without even touching her?

37
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:33,468
It's unusual that you
reported she was dead

38
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:34,720
and not unconscious.

39
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:36,847
[SUSPECT 2A]
I was convinced it was suicide.

40
00:01:36,888 --> 00:01:39,766
Things weren't going
well for her at work.

41
00:01:39,808 --> 00:01:41,977
Or at home,
for that matter, right?

42
00:01:42,019 --> 00:01:45,772
[gasps] No, that's not...
That's not true.

43
00:01:45,814 --> 00:01:47,608
Perhaps it's possible
your wife was bringing

44
00:01:47,649 --> 00:01:49,568
her stress from work
home with her.

45
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:51,403
Was there any domestic violence?

46
00:01:51,445 --> 00:01:52,404
[gasps]

47
00:01:52,446 --> 00:01:53,947
[ICHINOSE]
I'll take that as a yes.

48
00:01:53,989 --> 00:01:55,282
Look, but I
didn't do it, though,

49
00:01:55,324 --> 00:01:56,992
I didn't kill my wife!

50
00:01:57,034 --> 00:02:00,787
Heh. Yeah, but
who'd you hire to do it?

51
00:02:00,829 --> 00:02:02,414
[DETECTIVE 2A growls]
Dammit!

52
00:02:03,915 --> 00:02:06,043
This case is under
our jurisdiction now.

53
00:02:06,084 --> 00:02:08,086
It's been a pleasure, fellas.

54
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:10,213
Don't get cocky, Ichinose!

55
00:02:10,255 --> 00:02:13,008
[ICHINOSE chuckles]
I'm way too cool to be cocky.

56
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:15,385
What's with that guy?
Who is he?

57
00:02:15,427 --> 00:02:17,721
Not that it's hard to guess
that it was the husband.

58
00:02:17,763 --> 00:02:20,432
But to get him to confess
that he hired a hitman!

59
00:02:20,474 --> 00:02:23,060
[DETECTIVE 2A] I know, right?
Guy can read minds.

60
00:02:23,101 --> 00:02:24,686
[DETECTIVE 2B]
He psychic or somethin'?

61
00:02:24,728 --> 00:02:25,979
[DETECTIVE 2A]
No idea, man.

62
00:02:26,021 --> 00:02:29,024
He's got credentials in
criminal kinesics or something.

63
00:02:29,066 --> 00:02:31,568
From what I've heard,
he even helped the FBI out,

64
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:33,570
back when he was in school.

65
00:02:33,612 --> 00:02:34,946
[DETECTIVE 2B]
I don't get it.

66
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:38,200
What's someone that good doing
in that garbage dump of a unit?

67
00:02:39,368 --> 00:02:42,204
[DETECTIVE 2A]
Good question. I have no clue.

68
00:04:15,881 --> 00:04:17,632
[NEWSCASTER 2A] We now have
an update on the incident

69
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:20,302
a few days ago in which
several armed men holed up

70
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:22,345
in a Nihonbashi bank
and made off with...

71
00:04:22,387 --> 00:04:25,056
Sir, I... had a question.

72
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:27,142
What exactly am I supposed
to be doing here?

73
00:04:27,184 --> 00:04:28,393
Right, right.

74
00:04:28,435 --> 00:04:30,854
Tell me something, Nanatsuki,
do you know anything

75
00:04:30,896 --> 00:04:32,689
about what we do
at Special Seven?

76
00:04:32,731 --> 00:04:33,857
Not a thing!

77
00:04:33,899 --> 00:04:35,859
Definitely no rumors
that it's a bunch of rogues

78
00:04:35,901 --> 00:04:37,194
burning the budget.

79
00:04:37,235 --> 00:04:39,112
Well, that's depressing.

80
00:04:39,154 --> 00:04:42,282
So, listen, what we actually
do is specialize in pursuing

81
00:04:42,324 --> 00:04:43,658
Nine‐related crimes.

82
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:46,161
The terrorists? I didn't know.

83
00:04:46,203 --> 00:04:48,163
Yeah, that's what we do.

84
00:04:48,205 --> 00:04:50,290
The members of Nine
worship dragons, and yes,

85
00:04:50,332 --> 00:04:52,918
I do mean the mystical beings
that once ruled this world.

86
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:54,544
Dragons?

87
00:04:54,586 --> 00:04:55,670
[KIRYUIN]
Oh, sure.

88
00:04:55,712 --> 00:04:57,339
Humans have worshiped
and revered dragons

89
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:59,174
since the dawn of
recorded history.

90
00:04:59,216 --> 00:05:00,842
And some have tried
their best to gain power

91
00:05:00,884 --> 00:05:02,427
from them, as well.

92
00:05:02,469 --> 00:05:04,554
As you know, many
humans turn to crime

93
00:05:04,596 --> 00:05:06,264
in order to gain power.

94
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:09,226
But these humans have been
designated a terrorist group.

95
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:11,436
Special Seven was created
with the specific aim

96
00:05:11,478 --> 00:05:13,063
of standing against them.

97
00:05:13,104 --> 00:05:15,065
I thought their
leader was arrested.

98
00:05:15,106 --> 00:05:17,025
In the terror attack,
nine years ago.

99
00:05:17,067 --> 00:05:18,235
[KIRYUIN]
Very good!

100
00:05:18,276 --> 00:05:22,072
Yes, their supposed leader,
Warlock, was arrested that day.

101
00:05:22,113 --> 00:05:23,240
We sacrificed a lot,

102
00:05:23,281 --> 00:05:25,033
but they were
effectively destroyed.

103
00:05:25,075 --> 00:05:27,369
It was a nice, happy ending.

104
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:29,496
[NANATSUKI]
So, our job is done?

105
00:05:29,538 --> 00:05:30,997
Kind of a problem, right?

106
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:33,291
I mean, if there are no special
crimes, then we'll all be

107
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:35,502
out of a job before
we know what hit us!

108
00:05:35,544 --> 00:05:38,129
[NANATSUKI] Should we really
want more crime, though?

109
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:40,298
So, at the moment,
we just swipe a few cases

110
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,634
here and there from some
of the other sections.

111
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:45,387
Y'know, to give the brass a
reason for keeping us around.

112
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:47,389
No wonder they all hate us.

113
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:48,890
Well, I think that's
all I wanted to cover

114
00:05:48,932 --> 00:05:50,392
about the department.

115
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:53,728
Follow me, let's re‐introduce
you to your fellow members.

116
00:05:56,565 --> 00:05:58,024
I'll start with myself.

117
00:05:58,066 --> 00:06:00,610
Sakon Zeroemon Kiryuin.

118
00:06:00,652 --> 00:06:02,696
But my code name here is "Boss."

119
00:06:02,737 --> 00:06:04,114
We have code names?

120
00:06:04,155 --> 00:06:06,032
Yes, I've taken the liberty
of assigning one

121
00:06:06,074 --> 00:06:07,492
to each of our members.

122
00:06:07,534 --> 00:06:10,412
First. You see that dwarvish
dandy sitting over there

123
00:06:10,453 --> 00:06:12,163
in the green jacket?

124
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:15,667
That's Rokusuke Endo.
His code name is "Sniper."

125
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:18,295
Would you just give it
a rest with the code names?

126
00:06:18,336 --> 00:06:20,171
That crap's embarrassing.

127
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:21,965
[KIRYUIN]
Oh, come on, it's cool!

128
00:06:22,007 --> 00:06:24,593
So, as you might expect from
the code name "Sniper,"

129
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:26,011
he's an expert marksman.

130
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:29,681
Yep, that's clear.
It's great to meet you.

131
00:06:29,723 --> 00:06:31,016
[ENDO]
Hey.

132
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:33,810
[KIRYUIN] This elvish man,
here, is Kujaku Nijo.

133
00:06:33,852 --> 00:06:35,312
Code name: "Analyzer."

134
00:06:35,353 --> 00:06:37,981
Yeah, I'm gonna need
you to never call me that.

135
00:06:38,023 --> 00:06:41,359
"Nijo" it is, then.
I'm glad to meet you.

136
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:42,736
If you want
to know anything at all,

137
00:06:42,777 --> 00:06:44,487
you should pretty much ask him.

138
00:06:44,529 --> 00:06:46,740
He's the man with all the
connections around here.

139
00:06:46,781 --> 00:06:48,700
Great. Thank you, sir.

140
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:50,035
Don't rely on others.

141
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:53,413
You should get into the habit
of doing things for yourself.

142
00:06:53,455 --> 00:06:55,457
[KIRYUIN]
This is Akane Shikisai,

143
00:06:55,498 --> 00:06:57,250
and her code name is "Samurai."

144
00:06:57,292 --> 00:06:59,836
[AKANE] But, listen, you can
call me whatever you like!

145
00:06:59,878 --> 00:07:01,796
Hey there, new guy.
Nice to meet you.

146
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:04,257
Uh, yeah.
It's nice to meet you, too.

147
00:07:04,299 --> 00:07:06,885
I know she may not
look it, but she's a vampire.

148
00:07:06,927 --> 00:07:10,764
A real rarity. A vampire
samurai! Pretty cool, huh?

149
00:07:10,805 --> 00:07:12,474
[NANATSUKI]
Vampires suck blood, right?

150
00:07:14,184 --> 00:07:16,645
Heh! Hi there!
My name's Bellemer Cinq!

151
00:07:16,686 --> 00:07:18,813
I have a code name, too.
It's Ninja!

152
00:07:20,649 --> 00:07:23,360
Question: do we
employ minors here?

153
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:26,029
Oh, age doesn't
matter for homunculi.

154
00:07:26,071 --> 00:07:28,573
We're considered full‐grown
adults the moment we're born.

155
00:07:28,615 --> 00:07:30,951
If we wanna get real,
I'm your senior!

156
00:07:30,992 --> 00:07:33,161
You think you can handle that?

157
00:07:33,203 --> 00:07:34,204
[NANATSUKI]
Sure.

158
00:07:34,245 --> 00:07:37,958
And that goes double because
I'm a really great ninja!

159
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:40,168
So, what's Ninja's
contribution to the team?

160
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:42,379
If you ever need to know
about anything mechanical,

161
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:44,839
she's your girl.
She's highly capable.

162
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:46,132
[BELLEMER]
That's right!

163
00:07:46,174 --> 00:07:47,300
Wow, really?

164
00:07:47,342 --> 00:07:48,969
But drones are my specialty.

165
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:51,429
[NANATSUKI gasps, yelps]

166
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:53,515
I'm really pleased
to meet you, Ninja.

167
00:07:53,556 --> 00:07:55,433
And last but not least,

168
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:57,602
there's your
old friend, Ichinose.

169
00:07:57,644 --> 00:08:00,188
His code name is "Charisma!"

170
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:01,731
That's a choice.

00:08:01,773 --> 00:08:02,732
[yelps]

172
00:08:02,774 --> 00:08:04,943
Look, don't call me
by that name, though.

173
00:08:04,985 --> 00:08:09,489
Only the boss does that. 'Kay?
And don't ask my first name.

174
00:08:09,531 --> 00:08:10,949
Why, what's your first name?

175
00:08:10,991 --> 00:08:12,617
[ICHINOSE]
Don't. Ask.

176
00:08:12,659 --> 00:08:13,660
[NANATSUKI gasps]

177
00:08:13,702 --> 00:08:16,287
All right, then,
Seiji Nanatsuki!

178
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:18,498
From now on,
your code name is "Rookie."

179
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:20,542
Oh, please, sir,
you can't do that to me.

180
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:21,960
What? You don't like it?

181
00:08:22,002 --> 00:08:24,671
Aw. What's the matter, Rookie?

182
00:08:24,713 --> 00:08:26,923
Oh, right, by the way, Charisma.

183
00:08:26,965 --> 00:08:27,966
[ICHINOSE growls]

184
00:08:28,008 --> 00:08:29,801
Sorry, I mean Ichinose.

185
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:31,970
It looks like we might have
a shot at a new case,

186
00:08:32,012 --> 00:08:33,555
so, I need you to get on it.

187
00:08:33,596 --> 00:08:35,932
You heard him, Rookie. Let's go.

188
00:08:35,974 --> 00:08:38,977
No, seriously,
I don't want that code name.

189
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:41,146
Yeah, that's why I'm using it.

190
00:08:46,317 --> 00:08:47,360
[ICHINOSE]
Hey there.

191
00:08:51,489 --> 00:08:52,824
[ICHINOSE]
First time at a crime scene?

192
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:53,825
[NANATSUKI]
'Fraid so.

193
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:55,285
I've been at the scenes
of crashes when

194
00:08:55,326 --> 00:08:57,620
I was on traffic duty,
but that's it.

195
00:08:57,662 --> 00:08:59,414
Great, Tell me about the victim.

196
00:08:59,456 --> 00:09:01,750
His name's Hyogo Arisawa.

197
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:05,086
Occupation: politician.
Isn't that right?

198
00:09:05,128 --> 00:09:06,546
[ICHINOSE] He's made
kind of a name for himself

199
00:09:06,588 --> 00:09:08,423
in the ruling party recently.

200
00:09:08,465 --> 00:09:10,341
He lost in the
last election, though.

201
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:13,303
[NANATSUKI]
So, an ex‐politician, then?

202
00:09:13,344 --> 00:09:14,804
[ICHINOSE] A politician
who loses an election

203
00:09:14,846 --> 00:09:16,514
is just a citizen. But...

204
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:18,933
Looks like he wanted
to get reelected.

205
00:09:18,975 --> 00:09:20,685
I don't get it,
how can you tell?

206
00:09:20,727 --> 00:09:22,645
A daruma with one eye blank.

207
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:24,814
Wouldn't need it
if he quit politics.

208
00:09:24,856 --> 00:09:26,566
Oh...

209
00:09:26,608 --> 00:09:29,486
[ICHINOSE]
Still, talk about bad taste.

210
00:09:29,527 --> 00:09:33,073
[NANATSUKI] No kidding.
The cause of death, um...

211
00:09:33,114 --> 00:09:35,158
It's one stab to
the heart with a knife.

212
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,994
[ICHINOSE] Looks like we
can rule out suicide, then.

213
00:09:38,036 --> 00:09:39,037
Listen to this.

214
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:41,998
His secretary, Yosuke
Kasuga, found the body.

215
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,500
Arisawa didn't show
at a meeting,

216
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:45,418
so he got the
landlord let him in.

217
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:48,004
And they discovered
the body here.

218
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:50,673
[NANATSUKI] There's no one
else who lives on this floor,

219
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:51,674
isn't that right?

220
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:53,468
Not with the size of this place.

221
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:54,928
[NANATSUKI]
So, what now?

222
00:09:54,969 --> 00:09:57,347
Where do we start
our investigation?

223
00:09:57,388 --> 00:10:00,850
Wait, I've got it.
This was done by the secretary.

224
00:10:00,892 --> 00:10:03,978
[NANATSUKI] Cool. Wait, you
really just figured it out?

225
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:06,564
Nah, but it sure
woulda make our lives easier.

226
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:08,024
Yes. Yes, it would.

Hey, Belle. What's up?

00:10:12,237 --> 00:10:14,322
[BELLEMER] You're at
Mr. Arisawa's place, right?

230
00:10:14,364 --> 00:10:16,074
Sure am. Anything wrong?

231
00:10:16,116 --> 00:10:17,617
[BELLEMER]
Well, as a matter of fact,

232
00:10:17,659 --> 00:10:19,452
it's getting kind
of interesting.

233
00:10:19,494 --> 00:10:20,829
We've just received a report.

234
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:22,372
Looks like there
are three more bodies.

235
00:10:22,413 --> 00:10:23,540
Three more?

236
00:10:23,581 --> 00:10:25,375
Are you ready
for the interesting part?

237
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:27,001
All politicians.

238
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:30,463
[ICHINOSE] So, four politicians
were killed in one night, huh?

239
00:10:30,505 --> 00:10:33,758
Belle, you were right.
That does sound interesting.

240
00:10:35,426 --> 00:10:38,638
Victim one. Hyogo Arisawa, 37.

241
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:41,307
Former member of the Lower
House for the ruling party.

Currently unemployed,
but he was seeking reelection.

243
00:10:44,102 --> 00:10:47,647
Cause of death: single
knife thrust to the heart.

Victim two: Haruka Sakuma, 42.

Member of the Lower House
for the ruling party.

246
00:10:52,443 --> 00:10:55,405
Cause of death
is the same as Arisawa.

247
00:10:55,446 --> 00:10:57,991
Victim three: Kentaro Masuoka.

248
00:10:58,032 --> 00:11:00,493
He's a member of the Lower
House for the opposition.

249
00:11:00,535 --> 00:11:01,870
Same cause of death.

[BELLEMER]
Victim four: Toru Motoyama, 60.

251
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:08,918
Member of the House of
Councilors for the ruling party.

252
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,920
Wanna guess the cause of death?

253
00:11:10,962 --> 00:11:12,714
Four Identical deaths, huh?

254
00:11:12,755 --> 00:11:14,007
Well, I'm pretty stumped.

255
00:11:14,048 --> 00:11:16,634
They have anything
else in common?

256
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:19,053
They're all currently
under investigation.

257
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:20,972
Okay. What's the plan?

258
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:24,559
Well, let's split up
and figure this thing out.

259
00:11:24,601 --> 00:11:26,686

communications.

260

victim's election office.

I'll get on it.

the coroner's and check on

and the murder weapon.

265

out the crime scenes.

Ah. Yes, sir!

Well then, Special Seven,
all officers, move out!

gonna stay right here.

272
00:11:54,297 --> 00:11:56,090
Ha‐ha. You know what I mean.

273
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:56,549
[BELLEMER]
Uh...

274
00:11:59,636 --> 00:12:01,262
[sighs]

275
00:12:01,304 --> 00:12:03,514
So, that was
the last crime scene.

276
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:05,892
It's crazy, we looked
as hard as we could

277
00:12:05,934 --> 00:12:08,269
in there, but we didn't
find a single lead.

278
00:12:08,311 --> 00:12:10,230
Yeah, that's how
investigations go.

279
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:11,272
[car phone rings]

280
00:12:12,607 --> 00:12:14,192
We got a report from Gramps.

281
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:16,736
It turns out, all the weapons
match, like we thought.

282
00:12:16,778 --> 00:12:18,321
[ICHINOSE]
The same weapon, huh?

283
00:12:18,363 --> 00:12:21,741
So, our perp really did kill
four people in one night?

284
00:12:21,783 --> 00:12:23,034
Samurai got their schedules from

285
00:12:23,076 --> 00:12:25,912
their election offices and
I've listed them out for you.

286
00:12:25,954 --> 00:12:27,538
[NANATSUKI]
Wow, look at you go!

287
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:29,123
Come on, I'm a ninja!

288
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:32,293
[ICHINOSE] Hmph. Is Shikisai
there with you right now?

289
00:12:32,335 --> 00:12:34,629
[AKANE]
Hello. Yep, I'm here. What's up?

290
00:12:34,671 --> 00:12:37,298
Did you get alibis
for everyone involved?

291
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:40,343
[AKANE] Yeah. Nothing suspicious
about the families at all.

292
00:12:40,385 --> 00:12:43,638
And their secretaries have
pretty clear alibis, as well.

293
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:46,099
So, it's not gonna be easy, huh?

294
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:48,059
That kinda figures.

295
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:50,270
Did you learn anything
about the victims?

296
00:12:50,311 --> 00:12:53,273
Publicly, they really have
nothing in common at all.

297
00:12:53,314 --> 00:12:56,567
Birthplaces. Districts.
They're all different.

298
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:58,278
Political viewpoints?

299
00:12:58,319 --> 00:13:01,739
[NIJO] Don't match. They only
agree on tax reduction.

300
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:03,825
Every politician says that.

301
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:05,785
If they all want to
lower our taxes so bad,

302
00:13:05,827 --> 00:13:07,912
then how come they
keep on raising them?

303
00:13:07,954 --> 00:13:10,373
[NIJO]
I assume they compartmentalize.

304
00:13:10,415 --> 00:13:11,874
This can't be right,
they have to have

305
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:13,209
something in common.

to‐the‐point, isn't it?

312
00:13:24,971 --> 00:13:27,390
Their reasons are:
Hyogo Arisawa was accused of

313
00:13:27,432 --> 00:13:29,100
abusing power at work,

314
00:13:29,142 --> 00:13:31,477
Haruka Sakuma had an affair,

315
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:34,939
Kentaro Masuoka was
suspected of drunk driving,

316
00:13:34,981 --> 00:13:37,859
and Motoyama helped people
buy their way into schools.

317
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:40,236
Nah, there has to be something
more serious than that.

318
00:13:40,278 --> 00:13:41,779
What, no murder or anything?

319
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:42,905
Nothing.

320
00:13:42,947 --> 00:13:45,158
[NIJO] I was told Public Safety
is apparently acting on

321
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:48,119
the theory that the killer
was influenced by this blog.

322
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:49,329
That's the latest.

323
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:50,663
Huh?

324
00:13:50,705 --> 00:13:53,207
Is that information about
the victims even true?

325
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:55,168
[NIJO] Well, from what
I've found so far

326
00:13:55,209 --> 00:13:56,336
it's just gossip.

327
00:13:56,377 --> 00:13:58,671
Rumors from anonymous
message boards.

328
00:13:58,713 --> 00:14:00,923
[NANATSUKI gasps]
There are no other sources?

329
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:02,342
It would seem not.

330
00:14:02,383 --> 00:14:04,052
So, we think someone
randomly believed

331
00:14:04,093 --> 00:14:06,971
those vague rumors
and killed all four of them?

332
00:14:07,013 --> 00:14:08,556
That's crazy.

333
00:14:08,598 --> 00:14:09,807
[ICHINOSE] I got a
strong feeling there's more

334
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:11,434
to it than that.

335
00:14:11,476 --> 00:14:14,020
[NIJO] I could always dig
a little deeper if you like.

336
00:14:14,062 --> 00:14:15,313
Yeah, I was just
thinking that maybe

337
00:14:15,355 --> 00:14:18,024
you and Belle could
investigate the blog itself?

338
00:14:18,066 --> 00:14:20,610
[NIJO]
Roger. Ending communication.

339
00:14:20,651 --> 00:14:23,029
Man, that guy's like a robot.

340
00:14:23,071 --> 00:14:26,908
No, he takes it seriously,
and we should, too!

341
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:28,117
Come on, Charisma!

342
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:30,536
I'll give it my best,
kid, don't worry.

343
00:14:30,578 --> 00:14:32,705
But don't call me "Charisma."

344
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:39,670
Good morning, everyone.

345
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:40,797
[BELLEMER]
Hey, I got it!

346
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:43,257
Uhh... You figured it out?

347
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:44,717
[BELLEMER]
Take a look.

348
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:48,388
There's no doubt about it, this
entire blog is one big fake!

349
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:49,389
All of it?

350
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:51,766
[BELLEMER] Look, it has
a comments section. See?

351
00:14:51,808 --> 00:14:54,060
[ICHINOSE]
Yeah, okay. So what?

352
00:14:54,102 --> 00:14:57,105
[BELLEMER] Well, look, 83 out
of 89 comments were submitted

353
00:14:57,146 --> 00:14:59,023
by the same provider.

354
00:14:59,065 --> 00:15:00,733
So they're sock puppets?

355
00:15:00,775 --> 00:15:03,069
No, it's more like
the whole blog is a sham,

356
00:15:03,111 --> 00:15:05,321
from top to bottom,
every single part.

357
00:15:05,363 --> 00:15:07,990
Even if you submit
a comment, it gets canceled.

358
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:11,077
Don't you think maybe
it just takes time to show up?

359
00:15:11,119 --> 00:15:13,413
[BELLEMER] Nope. Everything
about this blog is managed

360
00:15:13,454 --> 00:15:15,331
and controlled by
a single person.

361
00:15:15,373 --> 00:15:16,833
I'm sure of it.

362
00:15:16,874 --> 00:15:19,627
Why would anyone do that,
though‐‐it seems pointless.

363
00:15:19,669 --> 00:15:21,587
[NIJO]
To make a threat.

364
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:22,964
What do you mean,
"make a threat"?

365
00:15:23,005 --> 00:15:25,383
This site's source
of information is solid.

366
00:15:25,425 --> 00:15:27,844
Oddly enough. It looks
like a collection of rumors

367
00:15:27,885 --> 00:15:30,972
at first glance,
but it's a lot more.

368
00:15:31,013 --> 00:15:33,349
The scandals posted
on the list are false,

369
00:15:33,391 --> 00:15:35,351
but they're also actually true.

370
00:15:35,393 --> 00:15:38,104
[ENDO] Okay, I don't get it.
What's that mean?

371
00:15:38,146 --> 00:15:39,897
[NIJO]
The truth is worse.

372
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:41,357
All these accusations
are written

373
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:43,192
to sound fairly harmless.

374
00:15:43,234 --> 00:15:47,196
Let's look at Hyogo Arisawa's
abuse of power, for a start.

375
00:15:47,238 --> 00:15:50,241
It's actually a labor
issue involving corporations.

376
00:15:50,283 --> 00:15:52,702
There have also been
some deaths from overwork.

377
00:15:52,743 --> 00:15:54,829
The families tried to sue,
but the suit was dropped

378
00:15:54,871 --> 00:15:55,955
at the last minute.

379
00:15:55,997 --> 00:15:57,748
This love affair is the same.

380
00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:00,418
It was actually
child prostitution.

381
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:03,212
In other words,
this blog isn't idle gossip.

382
00:16:03,254 --> 00:16:05,590
It's written so the people
accused will realize

383
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:07,592
someone knows the truth.

384
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:10,094
[ICHINOSE]
Right, so, who runs this blog?

385
00:16:10,136 --> 00:16:13,514
[NIJO]
Mitsuru Suga. Ex‐Public Safety.

386
00:16:13,556 --> 00:16:15,266
[NANATSUKI]
Could he be the killer?

387
00:16:15,308 --> 00:16:16,684
[ICHINOSE] No one's
stupid enough to cut off

388
00:16:16,726 --> 00:16:18,436
his own source of income.

389
00:16:18,478 --> 00:16:21,731
Besides, even in terms of the
timeline, there's just no way

390
00:16:21,772 --> 00:16:23,566
he could have killed
all four in one night

391
00:16:23,608 --> 00:16:25,443
completely by himself.

392
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:26,944
Then he's innocent?

393
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:29,614
No, he's definitely
not innocent.

394
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:37,788
[ICHINOSE]
I've got it.

395
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:39,582
Let's go solve
this thing, Rookie!

396
00:16:39,624 --> 00:16:40,583
Seriously?

397
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:42,460
You've figured
something out this time?

398
00:16:42,502 --> 00:16:45,671
Yeah, believe it or not, I have.

399
00:16:45,713 --> 00:16:47,465
[SUGA]
It wasn't me.

400
00:16:47,507 --> 00:16:49,926
[ICHINOSE]
Right, I know it wasn't.

401
00:16:49,967 --> 00:16:52,220
I'm just gonna
run my mouth for a bit.

402
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:55,556
If you disagree with
anything I say, speak up.

403
00:16:55,598 --> 00:16:57,683
You used your Public Safety
connections in order

404
00:16:57,725 --> 00:17:00,895
to get ahold of some scandals
involving politicians.

405
00:17:00,937 --> 00:17:03,105
But using that information
to threaten them outright

406
00:17:03,147 --> 00:17:07,026
would be a crime. And you
didn't want to take that risk.

407
00:17:07,068 --> 00:17:08,903
So, you thought the
smart thing would be to leak

408
00:17:08,945 --> 00:17:11,572
the information in the
form of a third party's blog.

409
00:17:11,614 --> 00:17:13,824
Of course, it made no difference
if the people who visited

410
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:15,910
the site believed it or not.

411
00:17:15,952 --> 00:17:18,371
What mattered was that
the politicians themselves

412
00:17:18,412 --> 00:17:20,873
would be able
to see it out there.

413
00:17:20,915 --> 00:17:22,792
Must have been spooky. I mean.

414
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:25,461
Just imagine seeing something
that close to the truth.

415
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:27,588
A blog that looks like
a bunch of baseless rumors,

416
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:31,092
but the author was hiding the
truth of it all in plain sight?

417
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:32,426
Look. It is!

418
00:17:32,468 --> 00:17:36,055
That blog is only gossip!
I just got the wrong idea!

419
00:17:36,097 --> 00:17:38,724
[ICHINOSE] Yeah, I suppose
you'd have to claim that.

420
00:17:38,766 --> 00:17:41,227
Right? For Public
Safety's sake, too.

421
00:17:41,269 --> 00:17:43,062
[gasps]

422
00:17:43,104 --> 00:17:45,815
[ICHINOSE] Don't worry,
that has nothing to do with it.

423
00:17:45,856 --> 00:17:48,067
Although, there were
people working for those

424
00:17:48,109 --> 00:17:51,112
four politicians who had
access to you, weren't there?

425
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:54,615
[ICHINOSE]
It was them.

426
00:17:54,657 --> 00:17:55,616
[gasps]

427
00:17:55,658 --> 00:17:57,493
The four secretaries
knew about you,

428
00:17:57,535 --> 00:17:59,912
and they knew the scandals were
worse than anyone imagined,

429
00:17:59,954 --> 00:18:02,498
so, the group of them
secretly joined forces.

430
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:05,001
It was apparently
a real group effort.

431
00:18:05,042 --> 00:18:06,794
[gasps]

432
00:18:06,836 --> 00:18:09,463
To put it simply,
it was a relay murder.

433
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:11,549
They made sure to
use the exact same weapon

434
00:18:11,591 --> 00:18:13,342
so it looked like
the same killer,

435
00:18:13,384 --> 00:18:14,885
and then they arranged
their schedules to

436
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:17,138
give each of them an alibi,
while also leaving

437
00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:20,725
enough time to kill a politician
they had nothing to do with.

438
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:22,143
Of course, they needed
someone to take

439
00:18:22,184 --> 00:18:24,312
the fall for it in their place.

440
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:25,938
Someone who killed
their four bosses

441
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:28,190
in a fit of righteous
indignation.

442
00:18:28,232 --> 00:18:31,110
A mystery killer who was
concerned for the country.

443
00:18:31,152 --> 00:18:33,529
And who do you
think fit the bill?

444
00:18:33,571 --> 00:18:35,656
You... You mean me?

445
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:39,035
You're one smart guy.

446
00:18:39,076 --> 00:18:41,537
At this rate, you're gonna
get pegged for the murders.

447
00:18:41,579 --> 00:18:43,039
You okay with that?

448
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:46,125
But it‐‐ It wasn't me!
I swear to you!

449
00:18:46,167 --> 00:18:48,878
The four of them, those
secretaries came to see me!

450
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:52,882
And they paid me. I filmed it,
but I didn't tell them.

451
00:18:52,923 --> 00:18:54,383
Get me that footage.

452
00:18:58,137 --> 00:18:59,680
[NANATSUKI] Didn't you
say that it was impossible

453
00:18:59,722 --> 00:19:02,600
for one person to do
in one night, Ichinose?

454
00:19:02,642 --> 00:19:04,685
[ICHINOSE] The end justifies
the means, as they say.

455
00:19:04,727 --> 00:19:06,520
Besides, Suga didn't know that.

456
00:19:06,562 --> 00:19:07,647
That's a good bluff.

457
00:19:07,688 --> 00:19:10,066
Now to arrest those
four simultaneously.

458
00:19:10,107 --> 00:19:11,400
Why all at once?

459
00:19:11,442 --> 00:19:12,735
Well, just think about it.

460
00:19:12,777 --> 00:19:14,654
They're close‐knit enough
to kill for each other,

461
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:16,739
so they're comrades
in arms, so to speak,

462
00:19:16,781 --> 00:19:18,658
and everything
that that implies.

463
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:19,950
Good guys aren't
the only ones who will

464
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:23,329
sacrifice themselves to let
their comrades get away.

465
00:19:23,371 --> 00:19:25,873
[NANATSUKI] So, we arrest them
all at the same time.

466
00:19:25,915 --> 00:19:29,710
[ICHINOSE] That's the idea.
All of 'em in one fell swoop!

467
00:19:37,385 --> 00:19:39,053
[KASUGA gasps]

468
00:19:39,095 --> 00:19:40,054
[ICHINOSE]
Hey! Wait!

469
00:19:40,096 --> 00:19:41,514
Huh? Where's he going?

470
00:19:41,555 --> 00:19:43,808
Damn it! Someone musta
tipped him off.

471
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:45,768
Rookie! Go get him!

472
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:48,854
What am I, an attack dog?
This is nuts!

473
00:19:55,152 --> 00:19:56,779
Man, he's fast!

474
00:19:56,821 --> 00:19:57,947
[ICHINOSE] Hey, I mighta
forgot to mention,

475
00:19:57,988 --> 00:20:00,199
that secretary is ex‐military.

476
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:02,284
Yeah, that would've been great

477
00:20:02,326 --> 00:20:05,287
to know a little earlier!
Also, where are you?

478
00:20:05,329 --> 00:20:07,832
[ICHINOSE]
Sorry, I'm not quick on my feet.

479
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:10,376
[NANATSUKI]
So, I'm on my own, then! Roger!

480
00:20:11,711 --> 00:20:12,878
‐‐[KASUGA yells]
‐‐[NANATSUKI] Whoa!

481
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:19,510
[KASUGA huffing]

482
00:20:19,552 --> 00:20:21,011
You're under arrest.

483
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:27,101
Hey! Stop! Just
turn yourself in, man!

484
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:30,396
No way‐‐ we're on
a mission, here!

485
00:20:30,438 --> 00:20:32,982
We'll purge the
filthy politicians.

486
00:20:33,023 --> 00:20:34,817
And then we'll create
our own government,

487
00:20:34,859 --> 00:20:37,361
one built on
righteousness and justice.

488
00:20:37,403 --> 00:20:40,322
They assured us that we were
fair and full of wisdom!

489
00:20:40,364 --> 00:20:42,241
And that our desire
to kill was righteous!

490
00:20:42,283 --> 00:20:43,492
Who is "they"?

491
00:20:45,578 --> 00:20:47,246
[grunts]

492
00:20:47,288 --> 00:20:49,623

Argh... Damn.

[KASUGA growls]

00:20:51,167 --> 00:20:53,419
[NANATSUKI grunts]
Oh, no!

495
00:20:53,461 --> 00:20:54,420
Die!

00:20:54,462 --> 00:20:57,631
[BOTH grunting]

[KASUGA groans]

498
00:20:59,175 --> 00:21:02,011
Like hell I will!
I hate corruption, too!

499
00:21:02,052 --> 00:21:03,179
[KASUGA groans]

500
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:08,642
But murder's not pure, or just!

505
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:19,945
I can't believe
I made it in time.

506
00:21:19,987 --> 00:21:21,363
You okay, Rookie?

507
00:21:21,405 --> 00:21:24,200
No, and you were
definitely not here in time.

508
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:36,045
Good work today.

509
00:21:36,086 --> 00:21:38,172
Thanks, you, too.

510
00:21:38,214 --> 00:21:39,340
[ICHINOSE]
How d'you feel?

511
00:21:39,381 --> 00:21:41,926
I'm glad we were
able to solve the case.

512
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:44,178
[ICHINOSE]
Well, good. Glad to hear it.

513
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:47,264
Let's take care of one more
job while we're at it, though.

514
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:48,599
[NANATSUKI]
Another job?

515
00:21:48,641 --> 00:21:50,976
The victims have
families, you know.

516
00:21:51,018 --> 00:21:53,312
We have to report
the arrests to them.

517
00:21:53,354 --> 00:21:54,647
Oh, right.

518
00:21:54,688 --> 00:21:57,525
[ICHINOSE] The people who
were killed may have been evil,

519
00:21:57,566 --> 00:22:00,444
it's true, but sometimes,
people like that only show

520
00:22:00,486 --> 00:22:03,531
their good sides to their
immediate families, you know?

521
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:04,865
So, then...

522
00:22:04,907 --> 00:22:06,534
Yes, reporting the truth
will make us seem like

523
00:22:06,575 --> 00:22:10,162
the big bad guys in the
eyes of their families.

524
00:22:10,204 --> 00:22:13,082
That must be tough. I bet.

525
00:22:13,123 --> 00:22:15,292
[ICHINOSE] Once you can
do this part with a calm heart,

526
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:17,336
you graduate from
being of rookie.

527
00:22:17,378 --> 00:22:19,964
Honestly, some people
never manage to.

528
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:21,215
[gasps]

529
00:22:25,427 --> 00:22:27,346
Well, Let's go, Rookie.

530
00:22:27,388 --> 00:22:29,890
Man, you're really gonna keep
calling me that, aren't you?

531
00:22:39,984 --> 00:22:43,863
[KIRYUIN] Huh? What? The diamond
from that bank robbery case?

532
00:22:43,904 --> 00:22:45,906
Doesn't the bank
have it for safekeeping?

533
00:22:48,951 --> 00:22:50,494
[KIRYUIN]
It was stolen?

534
00:23:51,388 --> 00:23:53,766
[KIRYUIN]
Next time: "The Threefold Trap."
