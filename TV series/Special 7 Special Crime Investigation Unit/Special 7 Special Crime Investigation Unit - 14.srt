1
00:00:11,094 --> 00:00:12,930
[NANATSUKI]
Ichinose.

2
00:00:12,971 --> 00:00:16,391
Stop slacking and help me
sort these papers, man.

3
00:00:16,433 --> 00:00:18,352
Have you seen
how many there are?

4
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:24,066
Sorry, I'm on break right now.

5
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:30,030
Hey, Belle, you don't
have to lug around

6
00:00:30,072 --> 00:00:31,698
all that heavy stuff.

7
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:34,535
I'm sure Endo would be
happy to help if you asked.

8
00:00:34,576 --> 00:00:35,661
[ENDO]
Who, me?

9
00:00:35,702 --> 00:00:38,372
Nah, my hips have really
been acting up lately.

10
00:00:38,413 --> 00:00:39,373
Sorry.

11
00:00:39,414 --> 00:00:43,377
[BELLEMER] I'll be fine!
I am a ninja, after all!

12
00:00:43,418 --> 00:00:44,920
You know what,
I've never understood

13
00:00:44,962 --> 00:00:46,380
that whole ninja thing.

14
00:00:46,421 --> 00:00:49,716
Nanatsuki. Less talk
and more work, please.

15
00:00:49,758 --> 00:00:51,343
Are you kidding me?

16
00:00:51,385 --> 00:00:53,011
[KIRYUIN] Warlock has
been arrested and Nine

17
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:54,638
has totally collapsed.

18
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:56,848
We've had to deal with
a couple of copycat crimes,

19
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:59,268
but no major
incidents, thankfully.

20
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:00,269
We're at peace.

21
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:01,270
In other words,

22
00:01:01,311 --> 00:01:03,480
we're pretty much
obsolete these days.

23
00:01:03,522 --> 00:01:05,899
[KIRYUIN laughs] I have some
mixed feelings about it,

24
00:01:05,941 --> 00:01:08,193
but yes, work is hard to find.

25
00:01:08,235 --> 00:01:09,486
[laughs]

26
00:01:09,528 --> 00:01:11,196
[NANATSUKI]
At least we've still got jobs.

27
00:01:12,948 --> 00:01:16,451
Ah! Is that... Nijo?

28
00:01:18,203 --> 00:01:20,289
Oh, wow, that sure
does take me back.

29
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:21,498
What?

30
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:23,375
Why does it look like
Nijo is being questioned

31
00:01:23,417 --> 00:01:24,459
in this picture?

32
00:01:24,501 --> 00:01:25,669
Uh‐oh, guys.

33
00:01:25,711 --> 00:01:27,212
I guess we're in for it.

34
00:01:27,254 --> 00:01:28,755
[ENDO]
He saw the photo?

35
00:01:28,797 --> 00:01:30,465
Right, Belle, tell him.

36
00:01:30,507 --> 00:01:31,508
Okay.

37
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:35,304
We've solved the case
and the criminal is...

38
00:01:35,345 --> 00:01:36,722
...Nijo!

39
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:38,098
What?

40
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:39,474
She's joking.

41
00:01:43,687 --> 00:01:45,355
[NANATSUKI]
Ah?

42
00:01:45,397 --> 00:01:46,481
[NIJO]
Who took this?

43
00:01:46,523 --> 00:01:47,774
I've never seen it.

44
00:01:47,816 --> 00:01:49,610
I thought it might
come in handy one day,

45
00:01:49,651 --> 00:01:51,153
so I snapped a quick pic.

46
00:01:51,194 --> 00:01:52,946
And I thought it was
freakin' hilarious,

47
00:01:52,988 --> 00:01:55,282
so I left it in
the official report.

48
00:01:55,324 --> 00:01:57,242
That's a clear abuse of power.

49
00:01:57,284 --> 00:01:59,077
Okay, what?

50
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:00,245
That's enough.

51
00:02:00,287 --> 00:02:01,538
Rookie's confused.

52
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:03,832
Cut the crap and
tell him the whole story.

53
00:02:03,874 --> 00:02:05,959
Unless you wanna
upset the poor kid.

54
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:07,377
Yeah! Please tell me.

55
00:02:07,419 --> 00:02:09,504
What's the deal with that photo?

56
00:02:09,546 --> 00:02:10,839
Already bored.

57
00:02:10,881 --> 00:02:12,424
I'm begging you, please!

58
00:02:12,466 --> 00:02:15,093
This'll take a while,
you better get comfy.

59
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:18,722
[AKANE] Hmm... How do we even
start a story like this?

60
00:02:18,764 --> 00:02:20,432
[BELLEMER] Well, guess we
should put the kettle on!

61
00:02:20,474 --> 00:02:22,601
[NIJO] That was before I had
any clue that my brother,

62
00:02:22,643 --> 00:02:24,227
‐‐Luka, was still alive.
‐‐[NANATSUKI] Man, just tell me!

63
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:26,229
[ENDO] Hey, hold on.
Where's that new sweetener?

64
00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:27,522
[NANATSUKI]
Hey!

65
00:04:10,751 --> 00:04:12,294
[NIJO]
Gimlet, please.

66
00:04:14,171 --> 00:04:15,130
I see your convictions

67
00:04:15,172 --> 00:04:17,340
are still as strong as ever.

68
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:20,343
Just like they were
the day we first met.

69
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:22,304
And? As for my request?

70
00:04:33,023 --> 00:04:34,524
[BLACK PEARL]
Here's what you asked for.

71
00:04:34,566 --> 00:04:37,486
Addresses and personal details
of all Nine members involved

72
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:38,904
in the airport attack.

73
00:04:42,157 --> 00:04:43,867
[BLACK PEARL]
And the profiles of every member

74
00:04:43,909 --> 00:04:47,454
of Special Seven.
You'll find it all in there.

75
00:04:50,332 --> 00:04:52,542
[BLACK PEARL]
As for Kiryuin Sakon...

76
00:04:52,584 --> 00:04:55,462
Unfortunately, I can't
corroborate the intel.

77
00:04:55,504 --> 00:04:58,548
No one knows if
it's accurate or not.

78
00:04:58,590 --> 00:04:59,925
Much obliged.

79
00:05:02,469 --> 00:05:04,805
[BLACK PEARL]
A word of warning, if I may.

80
00:05:04,846 --> 00:05:07,265
Information can be both
a weapon and a bright light

81
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:09,309
in the darkness.

82
00:05:09,351 --> 00:05:11,394
One must shed light carefully,

83
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:14,815
or else the lurking darkness
will be his downfall.

84
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:16,650
Take care, friend.

85
00:05:16,691 --> 00:05:17,984
I understand.

86
00:05:19,694 --> 00:05:21,696
Special Seven, huh?

87
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:23,114
Cheers to that.

88
00:05:24,783 --> 00:05:26,076
[KIRYUIN]
I'll introduce you.

89
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:28,787
Everyone, I'd like you to meet
Special Seven's newest member.

90
00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:30,455
His name is Kujako Nijo.

91
00:05:30,497 --> 00:05:33,458
Yes, indeed. It's a great honor.

92
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,210
This guy‐‐He was
on the career track,

93
00:05:35,252 --> 00:05:37,128
but for some
incomprehensible reason,

94
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:38,922
he's cast that aside
and asked to be transferred

95
00:05:38,964 --> 00:05:40,090
to our little unit.

96
00:05:40,131 --> 00:05:42,342
So you had all better
be nice to him, or else.

97
00:05:42,384 --> 00:05:43,426
[AKANE]
Of course we will.

98
00:05:43,468 --> 00:05:44,469
Welcome aboard.

99
00:05:44,511 --> 00:05:47,305
And kiss your dreams
of promotion goodbye.

100
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:48,431
Sorry.

101
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:52,394
[ICHINOSE] Pft. So, why'd you
want to be in Special Seven?

102
00:05:52,435 --> 00:05:53,979
What do you mean?

103
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,355
We're a specialized
unit that deals

104
00:05:55,397 --> 00:05:58,567
with Nine‐related crimes
and nothing else.

105
00:05:58,608 --> 00:06:01,361
No one in their right mind would
ask to be transferred here

106
00:06:01,403 --> 00:06:04,489
unless they were obsessed with
justice, or they harbored some

107
00:06:04,531 --> 00:06:06,575
burning grudge against Nine.

108
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:07,826
[NIJO grunts]

109
00:06:11,538 --> 00:06:13,456
That's dualistic thinking.

110
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:14,541
You see.

111
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:17,586
I have come to you as someone
who feels a certain duty

112
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:20,338
to look after notorious misfits.

113
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:21,840
I get it.

114
00:06:21,882 --> 00:06:23,884
You're gonna make
things easy for us?

115
00:06:23,925 --> 00:06:26,094
That is so nice of you.

116
00:06:26,136 --> 00:06:27,178
[NIJO grunts]

117
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:31,433
Well, then, we humbly
accept your offer.

118
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:33,310
Take good care of him, okay?

119
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:34,519
[NIJO]
Huh?

120
00:06:34,561 --> 00:06:36,855
[groans]
Seriously?

121
00:06:40,942 --> 00:06:43,320
[BELLEMER] Ichinose, I collected
the data we swiped

122
00:06:43,361 --> 00:06:44,821
from Section One earlier.

123
00:06:44,863 --> 00:06:47,657
You wanna come
check it out with me? Uh?

124
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:49,242
Where is Ichinose?

125
00:06:49,284 --> 00:06:50,702
He was just here,
wasn't he?

126
00:06:50,744 --> 00:06:53,038
"Patrolling convenience stores."

127
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:56,249
[BELLEMER growls] Slacking off
right under a ninja's nose?

128
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:57,500
Impressive.

129
00:06:57,542 --> 00:06:59,044
[NIJO clears throat]

130
00:06:59,502 --> 00:07:03,131
If you give me
the data, I'll look over it.

131
00:07:03,173 --> 00:07:04,382
Thank you!

132
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:07,010
You should make
Ichinose treat you later.

133
00:07:07,052 --> 00:07:08,428
[NIJO]
There's no need.

134
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:14,809
[NIJO sighs]

135
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:16,144
‐‐[applause]
‐‐Ah?

136
00:07:16,186 --> 00:07:17,228
Excellent work.

137
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:18,939
Yeah, you're pretty damn good.

138
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:21,816
We have to be, we're
fighting vicious criminals.

139
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:24,027
Combat skill is
the bare minimum.

140
00:07:24,069 --> 00:07:25,195
Hear that?

141
00:07:25,236 --> 00:07:27,030
I sure did.

142
00:07:27,072 --> 00:07:28,031
Okay.

143
00:07:28,073 --> 00:07:29,908
But we're supposed
to subdue the criminals,

144
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:34,204
not blow their brains out, so
you may want to work on that.

145
00:07:34,245 --> 00:07:37,165
This yields better
evaluations in training, though.

146
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:43,797
Hot damn.

147
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:44,839
All right.

148
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:46,091
Magnificent.

149
00:07:49,928 --> 00:07:51,012
What the‐‐?

150
00:07:51,054 --> 00:07:52,472
Aw, jeez.

151
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:06,653
[NIJO grunts]

152
00:08:11,616 --> 00:08:13,535
[ICHINOSE] But we're supposed
to subdue the criminals,

153
00:08:13,576 --> 00:08:16,663
not blow their brains out, so
you may want to work on that.

154
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:20,041
Tch. Of course not.

155
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:21,209
"Subdue"?

156
00:08:21,251 --> 00:08:25,880
Why should I let them live?
They killed my brother.

157
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:27,924
And you let them do it.

158
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:31,011
[ICHINOSE]
Hmm.

159
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:34,431
[KIRYUIN groans]
Well.

160
00:08:34,472 --> 00:08:37,559
Things have been quieter than
usual around here lately.

161
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,810
I think that has a lot to do

162
00:08:38,852 --> 00:08:41,438
with Nijo being a part
of the team now.

163
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:43,982
Yeah, he even picks up
some of Ichinose's slack,

164
00:08:44,024 --> 00:08:45,525
which helps.

165
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:48,403
Not living up to
your name, Charisma.

166
00:08:48,445 --> 00:08:49,863
I never thought it fit.

167
00:08:49,904 --> 00:08:53,241

168
00:08:53,283 --> 00:08:54,325
[KIRYUIN]
Hello?

169
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:57,620
Yes. He's right here. Why?

170
00:08:57,662 --> 00:08:59,039
Something up?

171
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,123
Oh, I see.

172
00:09:00,165 --> 00:09:01,583
Last night?

173
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:04,085
You think we've got a case?

174
00:09:04,127 --> 00:09:06,087
[KIRYUIN]
Listen up!

175
00:09:06,129 --> 00:09:07,797
It seems that there's
been a murder.

176
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:09,799
Three former members
of Nine were all killed.

177
00:09:09,841 --> 00:09:11,259
Just last night.

178
00:09:11,301 --> 00:09:12,260
[gasping]

179
00:09:12,302 --> 00:09:14,721
[KIRYUIN] And, as it happens,
all three of the victims

180
00:09:14,763 --> 00:09:17,932
were involved in
the airport attack.

181
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:20,143
They were part of the team
handling airport security

182
00:09:20,185 --> 00:09:21,603
when the attack occurred.

183
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:24,272
They were sentenced to do time
in prison for leading Warlock

184
00:09:24,314 --> 00:09:27,317
and the actual perpetrators into
the airport, but they were all

185
00:09:27,358 --> 00:09:29,235
released about a year ago.

186
00:09:31,029 --> 00:09:33,490
[KIRYUIN] Their estimated time
of death was somewhere between

187
00:09:33,531 --> 00:09:36,659
11 o'clock last night and
3 o'clock this morning.

188
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:39,913
And whoever shot them knew
which vital organs to hit.

189
00:09:39,954 --> 00:09:41,081
[ICHINOSE]
Sounds like infighting.

190
00:09:41,122 --> 00:09:43,875
[ENDO] They were former members,
maybe they were silenced?

191
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:47,378
[AKANE] And that means Nine
was probably behind it.

192
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,130
Yeah, about that...

193
00:09:49,172 --> 00:09:51,091
The rifling marks on
the bullets recovered from

194
00:09:51,132 --> 00:09:52,509
the scenes of the crimes.

195
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:56,346
They're a match for a very
specific police firearm.

196
00:09:56,387 --> 00:09:58,431
This one hits
pretty close to home.

197
00:09:58,473 --> 00:10:00,809
It's the firearm issued to Nijo.

198
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:02,018
[gasping]

199
00:10:06,147 --> 00:10:07,315
[ICHINOSE]
Hmm...

200
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:11,611
[ENDO]
So, is he gonna be arrested?

201
00:10:11,653 --> 00:10:13,238
We shouldn't jump to
conclusions and assume

202
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:14,948
he's the killer just yet.

203
00:10:14,989 --> 00:10:18,535
For one thing, he flat‐out
denies involvement.

204
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:20,745
[ICHINOSE] Yeah, but bullets
from his gun were recovered

205
00:10:20,787 --> 00:10:22,622
from all three scenes.

206
00:10:22,664 --> 00:10:25,542
So far, all the
facts point to Nijo.

207
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:26,835
And it looks like
the case against him

208
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:28,628
keeps getting stronger.

209
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:32,090
[BELLEMER] Section One recovered
security camera footage

210
00:10:32,132 --> 00:10:34,592
that puts Nijo near the crime
scenes a few minutes

211
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:37,137
before the murders.

212
00:10:37,178 --> 00:10:40,849
Gives 'em some good
circumstantial evidence, right?

213
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:43,184
Yeah, maybe
a little too solid, though.

214
00:10:43,226 --> 00:10:44,727
[AKANE]
What about a motive?

215
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:46,020
Got me there.

216
00:10:46,062 --> 00:10:47,564
[GROUP sighs]

217
00:10:47,605 --> 00:10:49,732
Well, in any case,
Section One and Public Safety

218
00:10:49,774 --> 00:10:52,318
will be watching him like
hawks for a little while.

219
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:55,071
So, until the real perpetrator
turns up somehow, I think

220
00:10:55,113 --> 00:10:58,241
we should all prepare ourselves
for Nijo's imminent arrest.

221
00:10:58,283 --> 00:10:59,242
I see.

222
00:10:59,284 --> 00:11:00,869
It sounds to me like
you're convinced Nijo

223
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:03,121
didn't kill those guys.

224
00:11:03,163 --> 00:11:05,707
[KIRYUIN] I've been observing
people for a very long time.

225
00:11:05,748 --> 00:11:07,709
I'm confident in my judgement.

226
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:09,794
[police siren wails]

227
00:11:12,463 --> 00:11:14,632
I've worked out
a deal with Section One.

228
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:16,926
Nijo, you'll have to surrender
your weapon to them until

229
00:11:16,968 --> 00:11:18,136
you're cleared of the crimes,

230
00:11:18,178 --> 00:11:19,846
but you can continue
to work with us here

231
00:11:19,888 --> 00:11:21,014
for the time being.

232
00:11:21,055 --> 00:11:22,015
Wow, Boss!

233
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:23,558
Way to go!

234
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,727
[KIRYUIN] The fact that Nijo
has a spotless track record

235
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:27,020
helped a lot.

236
00:11:27,061 --> 00:11:28,062
There's no way
I could have gotten

237
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:30,064
the same deal for Ichinose.

238
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:31,983
Yeah, rub it in.

239
00:11:32,025 --> 00:11:33,151
[KIRYUIN]
So, Nijo.

240
00:11:33,193 --> 00:11:34,652
You'll be under
surveillance for a while,

241
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:36,362
but try not to
let it get to you.

242
00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:37,947
Right.

243
00:11:37,989 --> 00:11:39,657
[ICHINOSE] Tell me,
what did you talk about

244
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:41,868
with those three low‐lifes?

245
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:44,537
I'll tell you the same thing
I told the detectives,

246
00:11:44,579 --> 00:11:46,206
because it's the truth.

247
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:47,957
I've never met those three men.

248
00:11:47,999 --> 00:11:51,169
Heh. You expect
anyone to believe that?

249
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:52,337
[NIJO sighs]

250
00:11:54,631 --> 00:11:55,882
Where are you going?

251
00:11:55,924 --> 00:11:57,592
Are you okay?

252
00:11:57,634 --> 00:11:58,968
I am innocent.

253
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:01,346
If I have to prove it, I will.

254
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:02,805
[ICHINOSE]
Hmm...

255
00:12:12,273 --> 00:12:13,441
[BLACK PEARL]
Been framed, have you?

256
00:12:13,483 --> 00:12:15,568
[NIJO]
Most likely.

257
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:17,654
[BLACK PEARL]
What did I say?

258
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:21,532
To shed light carefully or the
darkness might take you down.

259
00:12:22,784 --> 00:12:26,329
[BLACK PEARL] You're either up
against Nine or someone else.

260
00:12:26,371 --> 00:12:28,414
Someone who would prefer
this case not be

261
00:12:28,456 --> 00:12:30,625
investigated too thoroughly.

262
00:12:30,667 --> 00:12:31,876
It doesn't matter which.

263
00:12:31,918 --> 00:12:34,003
They've finally
given themselves away.

264
00:12:34,045 --> 00:12:36,839
All I have left to do
is corner them.

265
00:12:36,881 --> 00:12:38,258
What about Nijo?

266
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:39,801
He's not coming, huh?

267
00:12:39,842 --> 00:12:41,761
He's filed an official report.

268
00:12:44,138 --> 00:12:46,057
Okay. What do you think?

269
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:47,183
About what?

270
00:12:47,225 --> 00:12:48,977
Do you think it's even possible?

271
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:51,604
For a cop's piece to get
pinched without his knowledge.

272
00:12:51,646 --> 00:12:54,357
If it is, I'm not sure
he should be a cop.

273
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,609
But, based on what I
know of Nijo's character,

274
00:12:56,651 --> 00:12:59,279
carelessness... seems unlikely.

275
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,572
But, then, that would
mean Nijo had to fire

276
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:03,491
the shots himself.

277
00:13:03,533 --> 00:13:05,076
Hey, Belle.

278
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:06,244
[BELLEMER]
Yeah? What?

279
00:13:06,286 --> 00:13:08,871
Can you check
on something for me?

280
00:13:08,913 --> 00:13:11,499
Figure out how far away
these security cameras are

281
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:13,501
from each of the crime scenes.

282
00:13:13,543 --> 00:13:15,837
And while you're at it, how
many of them are installed

283
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:17,046
in that general area.

284
00:13:17,088 --> 00:13:18,089
Quickly.

285
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:19,590
I'm on it!

286
00:13:30,852 --> 00:13:35,106
[NIJO] I'm impressed
by your aim, Nagase.

287
00:13:35,148 --> 00:13:36,399
[NAGASE]
Nijo.

288
00:13:36,441 --> 00:13:37,900
You're highly skilled.

289
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:41,821
Certainly enough to kill your
targets with a single shot.

290
00:13:41,863 --> 00:13:44,365
Just like what you
did to those three.

291
00:13:47,118 --> 00:13:49,954
[NIJO] There are reports on the
bullets from the crime scenes.

292
00:13:49,996 --> 00:13:52,623
I'd like you to get them for me.

293
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:54,292
[BLACK PEARL] You mean your
bullets that were recovered

294
00:13:54,334 --> 00:13:55,626
near the bodies?

295
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:58,463
Wouldn't it be faster to
ask Section One for them?

296
00:13:58,504 --> 00:13:59,505
I can't.

297
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:01,549
The police might
be involved with this.

298
00:14:01,591 --> 00:14:04,844
[BLACK PEARL] You think the
real killer is a police officer?

299
00:14:04,886 --> 00:14:06,804
[NIJO] The bullets were
most likely identified before

300
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:08,514
the victims were even shot.

301
00:14:08,556 --> 00:14:10,183
It all happened too efficiently.

302
00:14:10,224 --> 00:14:11,559
[BLACK PEARL]
Hmm.

303
00:14:11,601 --> 00:14:14,187
It's too neat and clean
to be a normal criminal.

304
00:14:15,813 --> 00:14:18,775
[NIJO] First, there's the
security camera footage.

305
00:14:18,816 --> 00:14:21,694
Counting convenience stores and
traffic intersections alone,

306
00:14:21,736 --> 00:14:25,323
there are at least ten
cameras in the vicinity.

307
00:14:25,365 --> 00:14:27,075
But in the ten hours
after the murders,

308
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:29,160
which happened in the dead
of night, they were able to

309
00:14:29,202 --> 00:14:32,455
comb through all that tape
and positively identify me.

310
00:14:33,915 --> 00:14:36,626
And second,
almost simultaneously,

311
00:14:36,667 --> 00:14:38,586
they were able to
analyze and ID the bullets

312
00:14:38,628 --> 00:14:40,421
found at the scenes.

313
00:14:40,463 --> 00:14:43,132
[BLACK PEARL] But, still,
those bullets were yours,

314
00:14:43,174 --> 00:14:44,759
were they not?

315
00:14:44,801 --> 00:14:47,762
[NIJO] Indeed, those bullets
were technically fired from

316
00:14:47,804 --> 00:14:52,266
the weapon I was issued‐‐
I don't dispute that,

317
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:54,435
but they didn't
kill those men.

318
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:59,232
[NIJO] The only people
present for my training

319
00:14:59,273 --> 00:15:01,484
were Ichinose, Endo...

320
00:15:01,526 --> 00:15:03,778
...and you, Nagase.

321
00:15:04,821 --> 00:15:06,823
[NIJO] And when the three
of us left that day,

322
00:15:06,864 --> 00:15:09,409
you recovered the
bullets I had fired.

323
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:11,160
After shooting those three men,

324
00:15:11,202 --> 00:15:14,247
you left my bullets at the
crime scenes, near the bodies,

325
00:15:14,288 --> 00:15:15,456
in place of your own.

326
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:26,759
You should have been
a bit more careful when

327
00:15:26,801 --> 00:15:28,469
you selected the
bullets, though.

328
00:15:31,389 --> 00:15:33,933
I was only trying to
buy myself a little time.

329
00:15:35,726 --> 00:15:37,854
Enough to carry out the plan.

330
00:15:37,895 --> 00:15:40,273
Which was for you to
off yourself with this.

331
00:15:40,314 --> 00:15:41,441
Ah, my gun.

332
00:15:41,482 --> 00:15:42,900
I'm glad to see it.

333
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:44,235
So why'd you kill them?

334
00:15:44,277 --> 00:15:46,112
Because all three of them
were worthless cowards

335
00:15:46,154 --> 00:15:47,530
and they betrayed him.

336
00:15:47,572 --> 00:15:49,824
Ah! You mean you're with...

337
00:15:49,866 --> 00:15:51,576
They turned away from worship

338
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:54,954
toward the banal and profane.
Death to all traitors!

339
00:15:54,996 --> 00:15:58,291
I will offer Him their blood
and souls as sacrifice!

340
00:15:58,332 --> 00:15:59,292
[NIJO grunts]

341
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:01,002
Your snooping gave
me the perfect cover

342
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:02,462
to carry it out!

343
00:16:02,503 --> 00:16:05,298
And now, I offer your blood
and soul to Him as well!

344
00:16:07,008 --> 00:16:08,050
[NAGASE groans]

345
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:10,011
[NIJO]
So you're a member of Nine?

346
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:11,095
That's perfect.

347
00:16:11,137 --> 00:16:14,015
You can answer the questions
I was gonna ask those three.

348
00:16:14,056 --> 00:16:15,808
What happened
in the airport attack?

349
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:17,643
I might let you live...

350
00:16:17,685 --> 00:16:20,980
...if you tell me why
Luka Mizuma had to die!

351
00:16:21,022 --> 00:16:22,565
Tell me everything you know!

352
00:16:22,607 --> 00:16:23,649
What happened to him?!

353
00:16:23,691 --> 00:16:26,652
Luka... Mizuma...?

354
00:16:26,694 --> 00:16:27,904
[NIJO]
Answer me!

355
00:16:37,163 --> 00:16:39,624
I have no idea who that is.

356
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:43,252
I didn't even infiltrate
the police force

357
00:16:43,294 --> 00:16:45,588
till after the attack.

358
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:46,714
No...

359
00:16:46,756 --> 00:16:49,091
[wheezes]
So then, are you satisfied?

360
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:50,593
Huh, Nijo?!

361
00:16:50,635 --> 00:16:53,137
[ICHINOSE] Lower your weapon
or I'll shoot to kill!

362
00:16:55,306 --> 00:16:56,974
Ichinose?

363
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:58,184
But why?

364
00:16:58,226 --> 00:17:01,020
Oh, I just arrived at
the same conclusion you did.

365
00:17:01,062 --> 00:17:03,356
I was there for
practice, too, after all.

366
00:17:03,397 --> 00:17:06,150
Me, too, and I saw
how bad your aim was!

367
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:08,194
[gasps]

368
00:17:08,236 --> 00:17:10,530
[ICHINOSE grunts]

369
00:17:10,571 --> 00:17:12,907
Looks like you
wasted a trip, buddy.

370
00:17:12,949 --> 00:17:14,617
I'm not your buddy, guy.

371
00:17:14,659 --> 00:17:15,660
[gasps]

372
00:17:20,164 --> 00:17:23,084
You better be glad you're
such an important witness.

373
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:25,002
[groans]

374
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:28,047
Man, I'm too tired
for this crap.

375
00:17:28,089 --> 00:17:30,550
Did you drop your
gun like that intentionally?

376
00:17:30,591 --> 00:17:31,551
What, now?

377
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:34,887
Oh, yeah‐‐I have bad aim,
so I knew I couldn't hit him,

378
00:17:34,929 --> 00:17:37,515
and, like he said,
Nagase knew it, too.

379
00:17:37,557 --> 00:17:39,725
Made more sense to
pass the gun to a sure shot,

380
00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:40,726
so I did.

381
00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:44,063
Even though you would
be risking your life?

382
00:17:44,105 --> 00:17:47,775
I just figured
I should take a chance.

383
00:17:47,817 --> 00:17:49,735
[sighs]

384
00:17:49,777 --> 00:17:51,737
[KIRYUIN] Nijo has been
cleared of all wrong‐doing,

385
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:54,365
and the real killer is
safely in police custody.

386
00:17:54,407 --> 00:17:56,158
All's well that ends well!

387
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,661
I don't think it ended
all that well, though, Boss.

388
00:17:58,703 --> 00:18:01,664
The higher‐ups took the killer,
and Ichinose got injured.

389
00:18:01,706 --> 00:18:04,709
Actually, it could have
ended a lot better for him.

390
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:05,668
My arm hurts,

391
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:07,837
and I'm too tired to
do any work today...

392
00:18:07,878 --> 00:18:08,838
[laughs]

393
00:18:08,879 --> 00:18:10,840
Plus, a scandal
happened in the force.

394
00:18:10,881 --> 00:18:12,675
Covering up a whopper
like that is gonna take

395
00:18:12,717 --> 00:18:13,926
some doing, you know?

396
00:18:13,968 --> 00:18:16,345
Who would have thought
that Nine even had adherents

397
00:18:16,387 --> 00:18:17,972
in the police ranks?

398
00:18:18,014 --> 00:18:19,181
They're going to make
another grand sweep

399
00:18:19,223 --> 00:18:22,476
of the entire organization
because of all this.

400
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:24,645
We'll probably be getting a
summons from Public Safety

401
00:18:24,687 --> 00:18:27,148
before too long, so be ready.

402
00:18:30,401 --> 00:18:32,612
Ah, welcome back!

403
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:34,947
I've caused you more
trouble than I'm worth.

404
00:18:34,989 --> 00:18:35,948
[AKANE]
And worry.

405
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:37,950
But, no, not any more
than you're worth.

406
00:18:37,992 --> 00:18:39,118
[chuckles]

407
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:41,954
I was able to figure out
what was going on.

408
00:18:41,996 --> 00:18:44,665
But only because Shikisai and
the others put in the long hours

409
00:18:44,707 --> 00:18:46,792
and leg work gathering intel.

410
00:18:48,044 --> 00:18:49,003
That's right.

411
00:18:49,045 --> 00:18:51,255
You made these old bones
do a lot of walking.

412
00:18:51,297 --> 00:18:54,133
You should delegate
more to your resident ninja!

413
00:18:54,175 --> 00:18:56,218
I apologize.

414
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:57,261
[ENDO]
Hmph.

415
00:18:57,303 --> 00:18:58,763
[BOTH giggle]

416
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:01,891
In any case, we're glad
you're on the team, Nijo.

417
00:19:01,932 --> 00:19:03,267
So welcome aboard.

418
00:19:03,309 --> 00:19:05,436
Things may have gotten off
to bit of a rough start,

419
00:19:05,478 --> 00:19:08,105
but I think you're gonna like
it here in Special Seven.

420
00:19:10,191 --> 00:19:12,193
Well. Now that Nijo's
been reinstated,

421
00:19:12,234 --> 00:19:13,486
how about we knock off work

422
00:19:13,527 --> 00:19:15,029
for the rest of the day
and have a little

423
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:17,823
welcome‐slash‐welcome‐back
party in his honor?

424
00:19:17,865 --> 00:19:20,910
All right! Anyone else
craving Chinese?

425
00:19:20,951 --> 00:19:23,287
Sure, just gotta let
the sweetheart know.

426
00:19:23,329 --> 00:19:26,165
I'm in the mood
for some Shaoxing wine.

427
00:19:26,207 --> 00:19:27,583
Yeah, let's get drunk.

428
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:29,168
Your treat, right, Boss?

429
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:30,795
[KIRYUIN]
You know it, baby!

430
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:32,963
[NIJO]
So, this must be Ichinose.

431
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:35,257
[LUKA]
Yeah. He's my partner.

432
00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:36,634
[NIJO]
Your partner?

433
00:19:36,676 --> 00:19:38,302
What's his story, then?

434
00:19:38,344 --> 00:19:41,722
[LUKA]
Hmm? Hmm... Good question.

435
00:19:41,764 --> 00:19:43,140
And, to sum it up,

436
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:45,518
I think he's somebody you
could trust with your life.

437
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:47,269
That's some high praise.

438
00:19:47,311 --> 00:19:50,856
I really mean it.
He's trustworthy.

439
00:19:50,898 --> 00:19:53,359
[NIJO]
Shiori Ichinose, the partner

440
00:19:53,401 --> 00:19:56,737
Luka trusted more than anyone.

441
00:19:56,779 --> 00:19:58,698
Why did he save me?

442
00:19:58,739 --> 00:20:01,450
If he could do that,
why couldn't he save Luka?

443
00:20:01,492 --> 00:20:03,411
[KIRYUIN]
Hey, Nijo. We're leaving.

444
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:05,454
Attendance is mandatory.

445
00:20:05,496 --> 00:20:07,707
[NIJO]
Yes, sir.

446
00:20:07,748 --> 00:20:09,709
[NIJO]
I'm sorry, Luka.

447
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:12,253
I can't let myself
trust him yet.

448
00:20:14,171 --> 00:20:16,841
Are you guys telling me
all that actually happened?

449
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:18,551
[KIRYUIN]
It's crazy to think about.

450
00:20:18,592 --> 00:20:20,970
The fact that Nine already
infiltrated the police force

451
00:20:21,011 --> 00:20:22,513
that long ago...

452
00:20:22,555 --> 00:20:23,848
[NANATSUKI]
Wow...

453
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:26,142
I was already
impressed by Nijo's ability

454
00:20:26,183 --> 00:20:28,477
to gather and analyze
info back then!

455
00:20:28,519 --> 00:20:30,563
But I'm even more impressed now.

456
00:20:30,604 --> 00:20:32,606
He's like a ninja!

457
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:36,235
His audacity struck me,
more than Ichinose's.

458
00:20:36,277 --> 00:20:37,653
Oh, no doubt, man.

459
00:20:37,695 --> 00:20:39,989
I used to think he was
so unapproachable.

460
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:41,866
He may be more
aloof now, though.

461
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:42,867
Really?

462
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:44,660
I was just about to say
that he's softened up

463
00:20:44,702 --> 00:20:45,828
a lot since then.

464
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:47,163
[NANATSUKI]
Well...

465
00:20:47,204 --> 00:20:48,289
Don't say it!

466
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:49,623
[grunts]

467
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:52,084
You see?
Nothing soft about that.

468
00:20:52,126 --> 00:20:53,836
Ah. That reminds me:

469
00:20:53,878 --> 00:20:55,838
we owe someone else
a welcome party.

470
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:58,007
You didn't get one, huh, Rookie?

471
00:20:58,048 --> 00:20:59,008
[GROUP]
Hmm?

472
00:20:59,049 --> 00:21:00,134
Hey, no fair!

473
00:21:00,176 --> 00:21:02,428
Why did Nijo get a party,
but I didn't?

474
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:05,765
No, we had pho a while back‐‐
that counts as your party.

475
00:21:05,806 --> 00:21:06,974
I mean, we were pretty busy,

476
00:21:07,016 --> 00:21:09,518
with Warlock on the
loose and all that stuff.

477
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:11,145
All this reminiscing
put me in the mood for

478
00:21:11,187 --> 00:21:13,147
Chinese food again!

479
00:21:13,189 --> 00:21:14,273
It's settled, then.

480
00:21:14,315 --> 00:21:17,610
Time to call it quits and throw
