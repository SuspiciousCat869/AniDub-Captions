1
00:00:00,467 --> 00:00:03,333
Previously on "JoJo's Bizarre Adventure"...

2
00:00:16,328 --> 00:00:17,351
Blast it!

3
00:00:17,735 --> 00:00:19,946
Oh, no! The exit's blocked with ice,

4
00:00:20,259 --> 00:00:22,214
and more's coming this way!

5
00:00:23,757 --> 00:00:24,351
Shit!

6
00:00:26,381 --> 00:00:28,188
It's starting to cover the whole tunnel.

7
00:00:29,001 --> 00:00:31,181
I gotta find a way out of this deathtrap!

8
00:00:38,852 --> 00:00:39,549
What?!

9
00:00:40,813 --> 00:00:41,781
My paw!

10
00:00:43,766 --> 00:00:45,818
I can't pry my paw loose!

11
00:02:53,549 --> 00:02:54,142
Hmm.

12
00:02:55,115 --> 00:02:57,544
All right, the sun is about to set.

13
00:02:57,724 --> 00:02:59,678
Didn't "shades" say three hours?

14
00:02:59,845 --> 00:03:04,124
Guess that cocky beggar had a bit more
trouble finding Dio's mansion than he thought.

15
00:03:04,257 --> 00:03:06,760
Can't say I was expecting this to happen, though.

16
00:03:07,267 --> 00:03:08,586
Right, Avdol?

17
00:03:09,494 --> 00:03:11,035
I have a bad feeling.

18
00:03:11,662 --> 00:03:14,463
Maybe it's better if he doesn't
find that accursed mansion.

19
00:03:14,535 --> 00:03:15,145
Hmm?

20
00:03:15,169 --> 00:03:15,636
Hmm?

21
00:03:16,065 --> 00:03:16,842
You see,

22
00:03:17,338 --> 00:03:18,874
maybe he hasn't come back,

23
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:20,822
because he did find it.

24
00:03:22,372 --> 00:03:23,449
What are you saying?

25
00:03:23,826 --> 00:03:28,812
It didn't occur to me until a moment ago, but a
stand user is likely to be guarding Dio's lair.

26
00:03:29,051 --> 00:03:31,638
We may have put that beggar's life in grave danger,

27
00:03:31,928 --> 00:03:33,871
if he hasn't already been killed.

28
00:03:33,896 --> 00:03:35,595
What? Are you serious?

29
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:07,591
Son of a... I barely made it out of there,

30
00:04:08,144 --> 00:04:10,331
and my... my leg is...

31
00:04:10,719 --> 00:04:13,299
That ice caught my paw like a bear trap.

32
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:15,981
I'd be dead if I hadn't gnawed it off.

33
00:04:16,705 --> 00:04:19,733
I-I think I'm gonna hide out here for a while.

34
00:04:20,035 --> 00:04:23,045
If I'm down here long enough, maybe birdbrain'll go away.

35
00:04:23,773 --> 00:04:27,979
After this is over, the Speedwagon
Foundation can make me an artificial leg.

36
00:04:28,505 --> 00:04:30,054
But I'm still pissed as hell.

37
00:04:30,293 --> 00:04:31,427
Damn that bird.

38
00:04:31,722 --> 00:04:33,635
You're not getting away with this!

39
00:04:33,822 --> 00:04:36,350
I'm gonna make you suffer for what you did to me.

40
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,037
Just you wait.

41
00:04:39,376 --> 00:04:40,873
Wait. That sound.

42
00:04:41,013 --> 00:04:43,117
Something out there dove into the water.

43
00:04:45,788 --> 00:04:46,676
No way.

44
00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:50,712
Birds have the capacity to dive under water.

45
00:04:51,112 --> 00:04:52,698
Like humans and canines,

46
00:04:52,817 --> 00:04:55,540
birds are reliant upon lungs for respiration,

47
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:02,192
but the average bird has five to six air sacs
stored away in its chest and stomach regions.

48
00:05:03,772 --> 00:05:10,012
It's these pockets of air that give birds the ability
to remain conscious at altitudes of 6,000 to 7,000 meters,

49
00:05:10,107 --> 00:05:12,699
a feat completely impossible for humans.

50
00:05:12,997 --> 00:05:14,694
Even if it were to be strangled,

51
00:05:14,798 --> 00:05:19,182
a bird can survive for several minutes
thanks to its internal air reserves.

52
00:05:19,216 --> 00:05:20,502
With these advantages,

53
00:05:20,604 --> 00:05:24,036
a bird can survive underwater much longer than a dog.

54
00:05:30,628 --> 00:05:33,609
It sounds like something's headed straight for me.

55
00:05:34,035 --> 00:05:36,286
But how? That's impossible!

56
00:05:37,975 --> 00:05:41,082
I don't understand! What could
be coming after me down here?

57
00:05:41,313 --> 00:05:42,269
Wait a sec.

58
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:43,722
Could it be?

59
00:05:55,712 --> 00:05:56,999
It's that bird again.

60
00:05:57,151 --> 00:05:59,539
But how can it survive underwater like this?

61
00:06:07,223 --> 00:06:09,980
That bastard. Where'd it fly off to now?

62
00:06:22,739 --> 00:06:25,404
It's closing in, but what's its plan?

63
00:06:25,662 --> 00:06:29,390
More icicles? One, two, three.

64
00:06:29,459 --> 00:06:31,912
Great. Three icicles are coming this way.

65
00:06:47,116 --> 00:06:48,863
Suck on that, you frickin' coot!

66
00:06:55,485 --> 00:06:57,180
Yes. I did it.

67
00:06:57,334 --> 00:06:58,555
How do you like that?

68
00:07:10,718 --> 00:07:13,059
The icicles are stopping the wall from leaking,

69
00:07:13,561 --> 00:07:14,985
but at the rate they're spreading,

70
00:07:15,125 --> 00:07:16,578
they're gonna cover everything!

71
00:07:17,371 --> 00:07:19,659
No. What am I gonna do now?!

72
00:07:24,481 --> 00:07:25,897
I know what it's doing.

73
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:28,664
It's focusing on freezing the water around me.

74
00:07:35,939 --> 00:07:37,574
And it's cut my air pipes.

75
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:40,204
I-I don't think it's trying to suffocate me.

76
00:07:41,291 --> 00:07:43,524
Its real plan is to Bury me alive.

77
00:07:49,481 --> 00:07:51,303
It's no use. It's collapsing!

78
00:07:51,463 --> 00:07:54,225
This bird is too powerful for me to hold it off!

79
00:07:54,724 --> 00:07:57,690
And what's worse, I'm surrounded
by ice and freezing water!

80
00:07:57,715 --> 00:07:58,764
Just my damn luck.

81
00:07:58,788 --> 00:08:02,555
So much for finding a decent hiding
place to lay low in for a while.

82
00:08:04,948 --> 00:08:06,061
No other choice.

83
00:08:06,183 --> 00:08:07,714
I have to dig my way out.

84
00:08:07,812 --> 00:08:08,613
Give me a break.

85
00:08:08,652 --> 00:08:12,583
This stupid day has gone from bad to
horrifying in the worst possible way!

86
00:08:12,609 --> 00:08:17,031
First, I lose my leg, and now some demon
bird wants me flattened into a frozen dinner!

87
00:08:18,902 --> 00:08:20,745
Damn. I can't hold it off anymore.

88
00:08:20,805 --> 00:08:22,352
I'm about to be crushed.

89
00:08:23,242 --> 00:08:25,528
I need to dig myself out of here now!

90
00:08:32,632 --> 00:08:33,099
Huh?

91
00:08:33,550 --> 00:08:34,585
What is that?

92
00:08:34,731 --> 00:08:37,020
It looks like someone dug a tunnel down here,

93
00:08:37,386 --> 00:08:38,305
but why?

94
00:08:44,216 --> 00:08:47,002
It's the bird!

95
00:08:48,455 --> 00:08:50,819
It's getting ready to shoot another ice missile.

96
00:08:52,898 --> 00:08:53,500
Damn it.

97
00:08:53,706 --> 00:08:55,906
My stand is being held by the ice.

98
00:08:58,149 --> 00:08:59,776
I can't defend myself,

99
00:09:00,274 --> 00:09:02,135
and there's nowhere for me to escape!

100
00:09:05,861 --> 00:09:06,937
Wait. That's it.

101
00:09:06,979 --> 00:09:10,895
Either way you slice it, it's do-or-die time!

102
00:09:16,179 --> 00:09:17,552
I'll let the dome break

103
00:09:18,204 --> 00:09:21,822
and use the air pressure to catapult
me forward like a speeding bullet!

104
00:09:54,453 --> 00:09:56,087
I got out of there alive.

105
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:59,554
That dumb bird didn't have to
die, but it left me no choice.

106
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:01,295
One of us had to go.

107
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:08,358
But it looks like this'll probably be the end for me.

108
00:10:08,512 --> 00:10:10,751
I've been bleeding out for a while now.

109
00:10:11,384 --> 00:10:14,982
I hardly have enough strength
in my body to keep myself afloat,

110
00:10:15,148 --> 00:10:17,435
let alone make it back to shore,

111
00:10:17,775 --> 00:10:19,222
which means I'm gonna drown.

112
00:10:21,805 --> 00:10:23,245
Why is this happening?

113
00:10:23,467 --> 00:10:25,902
I was supposed to live a trouble-free life.

114
00:11:07,245 --> 00:11:10,348
Damn it. I messed up.

115
00:11:45,215 --> 00:11:46,722
Thank goodness I found you.

116
00:11:46,995 --> 00:11:50,927
As soon as I saw that little face and
those great big ears, I knew it was you.

117
00:11:51,441 --> 00:11:55,945
It's that stupid bird's fault that you're
like this. It attacked you just like my dogs.

118
00:12:01,577 --> 00:12:03,104
You're gonna pull through this.

119
00:12:03,511 --> 00:12:05,892
The bird's gone, so there's nothing to worry about.

120
00:12:06,122 --> 00:12:08,605
Try and hang on, all right? Keep fighting.

121
00:12:08,932 --> 00:12:10,653
I'll patch you up right away.

122
00:12:15,092 --> 00:12:18,102
The Bird: Pet Shop. Stand: Horus.

123
00:12:18,227 --> 00:12:20,360
Status: Deceased.

124
00:12:37,684 --> 00:12:40,678
Damn that mangy mutt. Where the hell did he run off to?

125
00:12:41,147 --> 00:12:43,488
He's gotta stop pulling stunts like this.

126
00:12:43,863 --> 00:12:46,783
I'm starting to get worried. He's been gone for a while.

127
00:12:47,421 --> 00:12:49,051
That lousy flea bag.

128
00:12:51,468 --> 00:12:51,981
Huh?

129
00:12:52,946 --> 00:12:54,481
Jotaro, what's the matter?

130
00:12:57,823 --> 00:12:59,920
There must be someone following us again.

131
00:13:03,212 --> 00:13:04,098
Not quite,

132
00:13:04,433 --> 00:13:06,060
but I thought I heard a voice,

133
00:13:06,379 --> 00:13:08,234
like someone's calling out to us.

134
00:13:08,441 --> 00:13:08,849
Hmm.

135
00:13:08,873 --> 00:13:09,827
A voice?

136
00:13:11,087 --> 00:13:11,758
Hmm?

137
00:13:20,322 --> 00:13:22,073
It's Iggy!

138
00:13:28,744 --> 00:13:29,390
Hmm?

139
00:13:29,966 --> 00:13:30,865
Iggy!

140
00:13:33,162 --> 00:13:34,309
What on earth happened?!

141
00:13:35,521 --> 00:13:36,201
Look at that.

142
00:13:36,226 --> 00:13:38,331
He's got injuries all over his body.

143
00:13:38,356 --> 00:13:41,360
Hey, Iggy's missing his front leg, too!

144
00:13:41,634 --> 00:13:43,721
You think he got run over by a car?

145
00:13:44,801 --> 00:13:47,883
He's not the kind of dog that gets into car accidents.

146
00:13:49,933 --> 00:13:52,641
You were attacked by the enemy, weren't you?

147
00:13:54,475 --> 00:13:55,306
What's this?

148
00:13:55,714 --> 00:13:58,229
It looks as though someone treated his wounds.

149
00:13:58,491 --> 00:14:00,846
I have to say they did a great job.

150
00:14:02,593 --> 00:14:04,498
But it wasn't Iggy that I heard.

151
00:14:05,473 --> 00:14:08,830
Whoever was calling out to us was definitely human.

152
00:14:08,976 --> 00:14:09,810
Huh?

153
00:14:11,616 --> 00:14:13,689
Iggy did have a run-in with the enemy.

154
00:14:14,935 --> 00:14:18,143
When we found him, he was half-dead in the arms of a boy,

155
00:14:18,174 --> 00:14:21,400
so the Speedwagon foundation doctors saw to his wounds.

156
00:14:22,668 --> 00:14:24,016
They did the same...

157
00:14:25,302 --> 00:14:26,534
For my eyes.

158
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:27,468
It's you!

159
00:14:27,493 --> 00:14:29,161
You're finally back!

160
00:14:36,839 --> 00:14:38,899
It's Kakyoin!

161
00:14:39,461 --> 00:14:41,762
Good to see you, Kakyoin! How's it going?

162
00:14:41,786 --> 00:14:44,821
Kakyoin, tell me, how are your eyes treating you?

163
00:14:45,208 --> 00:14:46,508
I'm glad you're all safe.

164
00:14:46,677 --> 00:14:48,036
We missed you, pal.

165
00:14:49,226 --> 00:14:51,339
So they were able to treat you?

166
00:14:51,401 --> 00:14:52,906
Yes. I'm ready for action.

167
00:14:53,299 --> 00:14:55,239
While it's true I'll have a few scars,

168
00:14:55,412 --> 00:14:57,094
my eyesight is back to normal.

169
00:14:57,174 --> 00:14:59,113
We're all really glad to hear that.

170
00:15:04,093 --> 00:15:04,961
Jotaro.

171
00:15:11,026 --> 00:15:11,573
Hmm?

172
00:15:13,235 --> 00:15:15,139
Where do you think you're going, Iggy?

173
00:15:16,663 --> 00:15:20,064
He may have been quite indifferent
toward humans and stands in the past,

174
00:15:20,257 --> 00:15:22,657
but now it looks like he's trying to lead us somewhere.

175
00:15:23,197 --> 00:15:26,736
I'm not aware of all the details
surrounding his encounter with the enemy stand,

176
00:15:26,761 --> 00:15:30,554
but judging from his resolve, this is about revenge.

177
00:15:31,152 --> 00:15:34,036
Maybe, but that still doesn't
explain where he's taking us.

178
00:15:34,137 --> 00:15:36,315
Hang on, Iggy! Wait for us!

179
00:15:36,948 --> 00:15:37,412
Hmm?

180
00:15:49,435 --> 00:15:49,957
Huh?

181
00:15:50,073 --> 00:15:50,632
Huh?

182
00:15:51,635 --> 00:15:53,363
I recognize that car.

183
00:15:55,854 --> 00:15:58,711
It's the same fancy ride the beggar was driving.

184
00:15:59,039 --> 00:16:01,527
C-could this wreckage mean that he...

185
00:16:03,075 --> 00:16:03,846
But how?

186
00:16:04,291 --> 00:16:08,019
What's strong enough to tear a hole
through a car like a piece of wet newspaper?

187
00:16:09,318 --> 00:16:12,310
It would seem as though I was
right to be concerned about him.

188
00:16:12,837 --> 00:16:14,597
He should have never been involved.

189
00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:19,770
Is it possible this is the handiwork
of the stand user Iggy fought earlier?

190
00:16:20,087 --> 00:16:22,667
All signs seem to point to that being the case.

191
00:16:22,861 --> 00:16:23,621
Iggy!

192
00:16:23,873 --> 00:16:24,287
Hmm?

193
00:16:41,111 --> 00:16:42,680
What the hell's going on?

194
00:16:43,588 --> 00:16:45,876
All of a sudden, I'm drenched in a cold sweat,

195
00:16:46,257 --> 00:16:49,592
and there's this oppressive
feeling of doom roaming in the air.

196
00:16:54,114 --> 00:16:55,787
I don't know about you guys,

197
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:57,622
but I am majorly creeped out.

198
00:16:57,695 --> 00:17:00,304
Where exactly is Iggy trying to take us?

199
00:17:04,791 --> 00:17:06,224
I know where he's going.

200
00:17:06,369 --> 00:17:09,318
This feeling, it's all too familiar to me.

201
00:17:10,366 --> 00:17:13,564
This aura is pure, unmitigated evil.

202
00:17:20,195 --> 00:17:22,057
It's the mansion from the picture.

203
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:25,251
We've arrived.

204
00:17:27,397 --> 00:17:30,319
Iggy, you were able to find it by yourself?

205
00:17:40,809 --> 00:17:42,854
What lay before Jotaro and the others

206
00:17:42,886 --> 00:17:46,457
was something more sinister than
anything they'd previously faced.

207
00:17:46,674 --> 00:17:49,389
They would soon look upon the source of their predicament

208
00:17:49,453 --> 00:17:51,788
and the very embodiment of evil.

209
00:17:52,816 --> 00:17:56,187
The path that had led them here was long and arduous.

210
00:17:56,433 --> 00:17:58,441
Foreign lands shrouded in mystery

211
00:17:58,466 --> 00:18:02,305
and treacherous stand-using
assassins met them at every step.

212
00:18:02,599 --> 00:18:04,956
Each battle was a struggle for survival

213
00:18:05,104 --> 00:18:07,778
where the wrong move would spell out certain death.

214
00:18:08,419 --> 00:18:13,684
There were tears, laughter, sadness, rage, and joy.

215
00:18:13,871 --> 00:18:15,634
The journey affected them all.

216
00:18:17,367 --> 00:18:19,681
Now nearly 50 days have passed

217
00:18:19,706 --> 00:18:24,339
since the team departed Japan on their
quest to save the life of Jotaro's mother Holly.

218
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:27,235
Everything led to this.

219
00:18:27,299 --> 00:18:32,490
The time had come to defeat Dio and end the
hundred-year curse afflicting the Joestar family.

220
00:18:32,890 --> 00:18:35,643
Joseph was determined to save his daughter Holly,

221
00:18:35,823 --> 00:18:38,844
and nothing and no one was going to stand in his way.

222
00:18:39,662 --> 00:18:41,965
Kakyoin vowed to remain resolute.

223
00:18:42,292 --> 00:18:45,024
He would defeat Dio not only to save Holly,

224
00:18:45,118 --> 00:18:47,488
but to overcome his own weaknesses.

225
00:18:48,323 --> 00:18:50,845
Avdol was steadfast in his conviction,

226
00:18:50,965 --> 00:18:55,075
considering it his personal duty
to root out evil wherever it lurked.

227
00:18:55,961 --> 00:18:59,016
Polnareff was determined to make the tyrant Dio suffer

228
00:18:59,308 --> 00:19:00,915
for turning him into a puppet

229
00:19:01,101 --> 00:19:04,121
and forcing him to betray his own principles.

230
00:19:04,909 --> 00:19:06,798
Iggy's spirit was untamable.

231
00:19:07,271 --> 00:19:11,588
He knew his life of turmoil
could be traced back to a single man

232
00:19:11,969 --> 00:19:15,444
and was intent on making sure the bastard faced his wrath.

233
00:19:16,248 --> 00:19:17,148
And so...

234
00:19:17,801 --> 00:19:18,836
In other words,

235
00:19:19,013 --> 00:19:21,203
if we beat the shit out of Dio in there,

236
00:19:21,456 --> 00:19:24,044
this damn nightmare will be over once and for all.

237
00:19:25,206 --> 00:19:25,999
That's right,

238
00:19:26,145 --> 00:19:28,623
and the scent of evil confirms that he's here.

239
00:19:28,706 --> 00:19:31,577
He's hiding inside the mansion like the coward he is.

240
00:19:32,017 --> 00:19:33,637
It's hard to believe, but...

241
00:19:34,791 --> 00:19:37,544
We've finally reached the end of this hellacious journey.

242
00:19:38,478 --> 00:19:39,990
All right, men, you ready?

243
00:19:55,221 --> 00:19:57,636
The gate's open as if they're inviting us in.

244
00:19:57,992 --> 00:20:00,775
This is totally different from the situation yesterday.

245
00:20:13,696 --> 00:20:16,244
Now that I think about it, if I can sense Dio,

246
00:20:16,451 --> 00:20:19,745
then it stands to reason that he
has the ability to sense us, too.

247
00:20:23,819 --> 00:20:26,301
If we try to enter the mansion guns blazing,

248
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:29,411
no doubt we'll be playing right into the enemy's hands.

249
00:20:29,944 --> 00:20:33,817
Before we do anything, we need to think of a strategy.

250
00:20:39,701 --> 00:20:41,301
Careful! The door is opening!

251
00:20:41,374 --> 00:20:42,519
Everyone on guard!

252
00:20:59,193 --> 00:21:00,121
Check it out.

253
00:21:00,485 --> 00:21:02,319
What's with this weird corridor?

254
00:21:02,386 --> 00:21:03,792
It must go on forever.

255
00:21:04,213 --> 00:21:05,800
This can't be real, right?

256
00:21:06,133 --> 00:21:08,279
It has to be some sort of trick or illusion.

257
00:21:08,311 --> 00:21:09,523
Listen, Polnareff.

258
00:21:09,756 --> 00:21:11,836
No matter what, don't go through the door.

259
00:21:11,896 --> 00:21:15,730
Dio's probably got a couple more stand
users waiting in the wings to fight us.

260
00:21:16,779 --> 00:21:17,258
Hey!

261
00:21:17,558 --> 00:21:19,036
Something's coming this way!

262
00:21:22,315 --> 00:21:23,741
Wait. Is that guy floating?

263
00:21:23,787 --> 00:21:25,436
Is he a stand user or what?

264
00:21:41,143 --> 00:21:42,449
Master Joestar...

265
00:21:44,161 --> 00:21:45,795
Welcome to our abode.

266
00:21:45,963 --> 00:21:47,459
We've been expecting you, sir.

267
00:21:48,027 --> 00:21:50,518
I am the resident Butler of the mansion.
