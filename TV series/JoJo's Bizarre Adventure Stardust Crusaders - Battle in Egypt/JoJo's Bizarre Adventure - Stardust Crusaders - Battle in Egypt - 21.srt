1
00:00:14,594 --> 00:00:17,834
You've finally come out, Dio.

2
00:00:20,969 --> 00:00:25,166
A job well done, Polnareff.
You managed to avenge your sister,

3
00:00:25,246 --> 00:00:29,511
but what's most impressive is that
you also found the time to track me down.

4
00:00:30,618 --> 00:00:32,926
I'll gladly kill you to celebrate,

5
00:00:33,147 --> 00:00:35,540
but I think we should start with this first.

6
00:00:40,748 --> 00:00:42,903
I'll give you a chance to rethink.

7
00:00:43,217 --> 00:00:45,738
Descend now, and not only will you live,

8
00:00:45,826 --> 00:00:48,141
you'll be given the chance to serve me again.

9
00:00:48,689 --> 00:00:50,809
Or you could choose to rise forth.

10
00:00:50,969 --> 00:00:53,759
However, you'd be ascending to your doom.

11
00:00:54,875 --> 00:00:56,814
When the two of us first met,

12
00:00:56,897 --> 00:00:58,929
fear consumed me like a curse.

13
00:00:58,993 --> 00:01:02,690
It gave your evil carte Blanche
to manipulate me like a puppet.

14
00:01:02,937 --> 00:01:07,760
That fear was the beginning of a
futile existence with no end in sight.

15
00:01:07,988 --> 00:01:09,793
It was a fate worse than death,

16
00:01:09,924 --> 00:01:13,627
a wretched life devoid of any
desire other than doing your bidding.

17
00:01:15,849 --> 00:01:18,151
But that fear has been eradicated,

18
00:01:18,346 --> 00:01:21,005
leaving only the burning will to fight.

19
00:01:21,322 --> 00:01:25,021
I've spent 45 days traveling
with Mr. Joestar and the others,

20
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:29,396
and in honor of those who died on
that journey, I'll never fear you again.

21
00:01:31,459 --> 00:01:33,470
My, aren't we confident?

22
00:01:33,588 --> 00:01:36,822
Climb these stairs, and put that bravado to the test.

23
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:44,718
Quite the interesting decision, Polnareff.

24
00:01:45,585 --> 00:01:47,352
You've backed down after all.

25
00:01:47,539 --> 00:01:51,207
Is that your clever way of telling
me you want your former life back?

26
00:01:58,801 --> 00:01:59,767
What in the hell?!

27
00:02:00,307 --> 00:02:01,944
But I went up the stairs.

28
00:02:02,035 --> 00:02:03,732
I'm sure. What happened?

29
00:02:03,999 --> 00:02:07,292
Problem? You seem to be shaken, Polnareff.

30
00:02:07,698 --> 00:02:12,366
But why is that? Could the winds of fear
have extinguished your burning resolve?

31
00:02:12,446 --> 00:02:15,191
Perhaps the only steps you took were in your mind,

32
00:02:15,256 --> 00:02:18,395
and in actuality fear overrode your consciousness,

33
00:02:18,472 --> 00:02:22,545
wrestling control from your brain,
causing you to descend down the stairs.

34
00:02:22,718 --> 00:02:23,400
No way!

35
00:02:23,604 --> 00:02:25,947
I'm positive I just walked up those stairs.

36
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:30,830
What?

37
00:02:31,052 --> 00:02:32,849
Is he doing this with his stand?

38
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,884
No! It couldn't be.

39
00:02:39,626 --> 00:02:41,025
Dio's stand is...

40
00:02:43,064 --> 00:02:44,186
The World?!

41
00:02:46,321 --> 00:02:48,447
What am I supposed to do now?

42
00:04:21,394 --> 00:04:23,282
I'm curious, Polnareff.

43
00:04:23,495 --> 00:04:27,099
Have you ever wondered what the human soul desires most?

44
00:04:27,329 --> 00:04:28,506
Peace of mind.

45
00:04:28,766 --> 00:04:32,479
Subconsciously, all humans wish to overcome their fears.

46
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:36,628
They seek fame, money, and dominance of others,

47
00:04:36,822 --> 00:04:40,119
all to obtain a sense of everlasting security.

48
00:04:40,644 --> 00:04:41,911
What a farce.

49
00:04:42,107 --> 00:04:45,082
They create bonds as a means of self-preservation.

50
00:04:45,428 --> 00:04:47,381
They say they wish to help others

51
00:04:47,516 --> 00:04:49,889
purely for the sake of love and justice,

52
00:04:49,914 --> 00:04:52,644
but it's only to settle their feeble minds.

53
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:56,494
Humanity's greatest desire is to latch on to serenity.

54
00:04:57,367 --> 00:05:00,251
So why? Why refuse to serve me?

55
00:05:00,307 --> 00:05:02,391
What greater serenity is there?

56
00:05:02,471 --> 00:05:06,076
Return to me, and all I speak of will be yours.

57
00:05:06,396 --> 00:05:08,169
You don't want to challenge me.

58
00:05:08,215 --> 00:05:11,850
There's just no point in running
headlong into a meaningless death.

59
00:05:12,083 --> 00:05:13,960
You deserve much more.

60
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:18,151
No, am I seriously letting him draw me back in?

61
00:05:18,608 --> 00:05:20,747
You're a talented stand user.

62
00:05:20,921 --> 00:05:23,329
It would be a shame to kill you.

63
00:05:23,531 --> 00:05:27,939
Turn your back on Joestar, and live as my right hand.

64
00:05:28,184 --> 00:05:31,275
I promise you unending peace starting now.

65
00:05:31,629 --> 00:05:32,997
I have to resist.

66
00:05:33,037 --> 00:05:36,400
Avdol, Iggy, I need your courage.

67
00:05:37,847 --> 00:05:39,421
Cut the bullshit, Dio!

68
00:05:39,465 --> 00:05:41,410
I've already stared death in the eye!

69
00:05:42,732 --> 00:05:44,552
And I'll gladly do it again

70
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:47,189
if it helps uncover your stand's abilities!

71
00:05:49,499 --> 00:05:50,980
How disappointing.

72
00:05:51,097 --> 00:05:51,834
Hmm.

73
00:05:56,907 --> 00:05:59,280
Time to meet your end, Polnareff!

74
00:06:00,618 --> 00:06:03,208
So that's your stand, The World! Bring it!

75
00:06:03,241 --> 00:06:04,511
Muda! Muda! Muda! Muda! Muda! Muda!

76
00:06:04,536 --> 00:06:06,671
Muda! Muda! Muda! Muda! Muda! Muda! Muda!

77
00:06:08,321 --> 00:06:08,804
Huh?

78
00:06:10,704 --> 00:06:12,470
Mm?

79
00:06:17,465 --> 00:06:19,599
It's Mr. Joestar!

80
00:06:20,073 --> 00:06:22,516
There's no need to worry, Polnareff.

81
00:06:26,372 --> 00:06:27,006
Dio!

82
00:06:27,623 --> 00:06:29,063
That was Dio!

83
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:30,402
After him!

84
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:32,469
I have to tell you something first!

85
00:06:33,121 --> 00:06:37,265
It was only out in the open for a
moment or two, but I saw him use his stand.

86
00:06:37,324 --> 00:06:39,734
Uh, well, I didn't actually see it,

87
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:41,996
but I did feel it in a manner of speaking.

88
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:45,651
It's complicated, but here's the long and short of it.

89
00:06:45,943 --> 00:06:51,114
I was heading up the stairs to beat the life out of
that bastard when suddenly I was back where I started.

90
00:06:52,004 --> 00:06:55,152
Believe me, I know what I'm
saying doesn't make any sense at all.

91
00:06:55,572 --> 00:06:58,067
I can't wrap my head around what happened either.

92
00:06:58,101 --> 00:07:00,704
I feel like I'm losing my mind over here.

93
00:07:00,856 --> 00:07:03,583
I'm sure he wasn't using any sort of hypnosis.

94
00:07:03,608 --> 00:07:06,303
I'd say super speed, but there's no way.

95
00:07:06,956 --> 00:07:10,746
All I know is that I sensed something utterly terrifying.

96
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,686
Hey, where are Iggy and Avdol?

97
00:07:19,773 --> 00:07:21,008
They didn't make it.

98
00:07:21,033 --> 00:07:22,149
They're both dead.

99
00:07:23,376 --> 00:07:26,171
They died trying to save me.

100
00:07:32,832 --> 00:07:33,981
Is that so?

101
00:07:38,966 --> 00:07:39,901
We should go.

102
00:07:40,459 --> 00:07:42,403
Look, Mr. Joestar. The sun is setting.

103
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:43,439
Let's hurry.

104
00:07:44,893 --> 00:07:46,086
Yeah, you're right.

105
00:07:47,142 --> 00:07:48,473
All right, out with it!

106
00:07:48,566 --> 00:07:50,383
What's waiting for us upstairs?

107
00:07:50,943 --> 00:07:52,696
The... the towers!

108
00:07:52,876 --> 00:07:54,888
There's also another room at the top!

109
00:07:54,919 --> 00:07:56,716
It's where lord Dio dwells during the day!

110
00:07:56,754 --> 00:07:58,763
Is there another staircase to the tower?

111
00:07:58,986 --> 00:08:01,857
No, this is the only set of stairs that leads there.

112
00:08:02,096 --> 00:08:03,939
In that case, lead the way.

113
00:08:19,846 --> 00:08:20,658
Ora!

114
00:08:23,957 --> 00:08:25,174
So that's him.

115
00:08:26,421 --> 00:08:28,349
The two of us have never met,

116
00:08:28,642 --> 00:08:32,226
but I've known about this monster
for longer than I care to remember.

117
00:08:32,914 --> 00:08:34,989
How could I not know this fiend?

118
00:08:35,302 --> 00:08:39,775
The thought of him has been burned into
my mind ever since the day I was born.

119
00:08:40,297 --> 00:08:41,730
Same for Jotaro.

120
00:08:42,523 --> 00:08:44,529
We'd hoped this day would never come,

121
00:08:44,682 --> 00:08:46,764
that we'd never have to face Dio,

122
00:08:47,034 --> 00:08:50,914
but as Joestars, we knew we'd
eventually have to destroy him.

123
00:08:51,678 --> 00:08:53,115
I have no regrets.

124
00:08:53,786 --> 00:08:56,035
I came on this journey of my own free will,

125
00:08:56,508 --> 00:08:59,230
so I can live with whatever happens from here on out.

126
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:02,653
I've never seen things more clearly.

127
00:09:02,678 --> 00:09:05,346
It's like a light of clarity has washed over me.

128
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:09,093
My friends are that light, while Dio is darkness.

129
00:09:09,793 --> 00:09:13,537
My body may be broken and
battered, but the fear has vanished.

130
00:09:13,921 --> 00:09:16,578
Virtue and light has purified my soul.

131
00:09:17,619 --> 00:09:20,473
We'll attack the moment Dio steps out of the coffin.

132
00:09:20,634 --> 00:09:21,910
Stay at the ready.

133
00:09:22,156 --> 00:09:24,820
We don't know what tricks he has up his sleeves.

134
00:09:26,659 --> 00:09:27,992
It's time, loser.

135
00:09:28,242 --> 00:09:29,299
Open the coffin.

136
00:09:31,085 --> 00:09:35,386
Whatever happens, lord Dio, you
have to know I never betrayed you.

137
00:09:35,706 --> 00:09:41,088
I only led these degenerates here, because I
knew you had the power to easily dispose of them!

138
00:09:41,137 --> 00:09:45,718
As certain as a man wetting himself when
pissing in the wind, your victory is assured.

139
00:09:45,743 --> 00:09:47,378
You are all-powerful.

140
00:09:47,494 --> 00:09:49,572
Please don't be angry with me!

141
00:09:49,597 --> 00:09:50,999
Enough of the groveling!

142
00:09:51,223 --> 00:09:52,759
Open the damn coffin!

143
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,753
Please, I'm begging you,

144
00:09:55,789 --> 00:09:58,595
give these bastards a cruel and horrifying end...

145
00:09:59,308 --> 00:10:01,463
Lord Dio!

146
00:10:02,729 --> 00:10:04,062
Get ready, everyone.

147
00:10:10,073 --> 00:10:10,661
Huh?

148
00:10:11,377 --> 00:10:12,315
Why?

149
00:10:15,125 --> 00:10:17,113
I don't know what's going on.

150
00:10:17,168 --> 00:10:19,768
How'd I get in here? I was just opening the coffin!

151
00:10:19,801 --> 00:10:22,041
What the hell?! How did he...

152
00:10:22,208 --> 00:10:24,929
My eyes were locked on loser boy the entire time.

153
00:10:24,969 --> 00:10:27,002
Did anyone else see him get in the coffin?

154
00:10:27,275 --> 00:10:30,237
Wait! Did someone put him in there without us knowing?

155
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:32,400
No, I was watching him just like you were.

156
00:10:32,446 --> 00:10:35,579
He's opening the coffin one
second, and the next, he's inside it.

157
00:10:35,626 --> 00:10:36,810
You're right, Polnareff,

158
00:10:37,072 --> 00:10:38,847
but I don't believe it's a mind trick,

159
00:10:38,879 --> 00:10:40,627
and it's not super speed either.

160
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:41,880
Good grief.

161
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,615
Is he playing games with us?

162
00:10:46,917 --> 00:10:48,569
Get out of here!

163
00:10:50,013 --> 00:10:51,464
Damn you!

164
00:10:51,505 --> 00:10:53,635
What are you doing?! Come on!

165
00:10:57,617 --> 00:10:59,096
Let me go!

166
00:11:01,884 --> 00:11:04,484
Okay, what was that feeling back there?

167
00:11:04,725 --> 00:11:07,500
The ominous presence it was
giving off was far more powerful

168
00:11:07,525 --> 00:11:10,199
than any stand our group has ever encountered before!

169
00:11:10,711 --> 00:11:15,088
It was like knowing a bulldozer is coming after
you just from the sound of its roaring engine!

170
00:11:15,405 --> 00:11:19,080
Yeah, I sensed it, too, an insane lust to kill us.

171
00:11:19,146 --> 00:11:22,007
It felt like somebody shoving an icicle up my ass!

172
00:11:22,114 --> 00:11:26,088
If we hadn't escaped when we did, whatever
that was would have killed us for sure!

173
00:11:40,994 --> 00:11:43,141
Damn it! Just look at the sun.

174
00:11:43,434 --> 00:11:45,514
It's almost gone below the horizon.

175
00:11:46,027 --> 00:11:48,262
Dio will have the advantage in the dark.

176
00:11:50,679 --> 00:11:51,504
Hang on.

177
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:56,002
Come again?! Please don't tell me you guys
are planning to run away and hide until dawn.

178
00:11:56,050 --> 00:11:59,232
Listen to me, Mr. Joestar. I'm finishing this.

179
00:11:59,257 --> 00:12:02,000
There's no way I'm packing up and heading for the hills.

180
00:12:02,127 --> 00:12:04,917
You're right. We have to see this through to the end.

181
00:12:08,667 --> 00:12:11,177
I wanna get this over with as much as you do,

182
00:12:11,485 --> 00:12:13,420
but the tide of battle has turned.

183
00:12:13,703 --> 00:12:16,469
While not up close, we've faced his stand, The World,

184
00:12:16,589 --> 00:12:19,233
but we still have no idea what its powers are.

185
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:21,783
We're fighting blind here. Think of it this way.

186
00:12:21,882 --> 00:12:24,164
It's like mountain climbing without knowing the route.

187
00:12:24,204 --> 00:12:27,207
If we try to fight Dio right now, we'll all die.

188
00:12:27,551 --> 00:12:32,101
That fact is as inevitable as burping
after knocking back a couple of colas.

189
00:12:33,474 --> 00:12:36,249
Dio would be a fool not to come racing after us,

190
00:12:36,396 --> 00:12:38,779
but he only has until sunrise to kill us.

191
00:12:38,972 --> 00:12:43,571
In the meantime, we need to learn the extent of
his stand's power and find a way to put him down.

192
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:45,741
If we can just hold out until then...

193
00:12:45,795 --> 00:12:48,610
No way! I'm not going back on my word!

194
00:12:48,695 --> 00:12:51,400
Avdol and Iggy died because of my weakness!

195
00:12:51,635 --> 00:12:53,382
I have to kill Dio.

196
00:12:53,675 --> 00:12:55,526
I'll go to hell and back to do it,

197
00:12:55,569 --> 00:12:59,116
but what I won't do is run away from my obligation!

198
00:12:59,141 --> 00:13:01,080
No! Come back, Polnareff!

199
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:03,453
Forget it. He's not gonna listen.

200
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:06,386
Jotaro, what do you think we should do now?

201
00:13:09,276 --> 00:13:11,877
He went down there to fight Dio.

202
00:13:12,364 --> 00:13:14,767
As we retreat, we'll also be fighting him,

203
00:13:15,507 --> 00:13:18,989
which means we'll be attacking from both sides at once.

204
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:24,020
Hey, buddy,

205
00:13:24,407 --> 00:13:26,897
let us buy this truck off you. What do you say?

206
00:13:27,130 --> 00:13:28,709
The hell is wrong with you?!

207
00:13:28,991 --> 00:13:31,693
This baby's my bread and butter! No way I'd...

208
00:13:31,718 --> 00:13:32,651
It's all yours.

209
00:13:35,301 --> 00:13:36,791
Buckle up, Kakyoin.

210
00:13:54,453 --> 00:13:56,100
There you are, Dio.

211
00:13:56,153 --> 00:13:57,979
Think I'll just run 'til dawn?

212
00:13:58,019 --> 00:13:59,807
You've crossed the wrong Frenchmen.

213
00:13:59,987 --> 00:14:02,371
I'll settle this on my own if I have to.

214
00:14:02,396 --> 00:14:04,966
So what if I don't know how Dio's stand works?

215
00:14:05,012 --> 00:14:07,443
I'll just find another way to defeat him.

216
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:09,247
He's dead.

217
00:14:09,713 --> 00:14:11,017
Hold it, Polnareff.

218
00:14:12,551 --> 00:14:16,717
I had them let you go, 'cause convincing
stubborn guys like you is a pain in the ass,

219
00:14:17,164 --> 00:14:22,118
but the old man and Kakyoin insisted I
stay close and watch your back, so here I am.

220
00:14:22,645 --> 00:14:23,791
Jotaro!

221
00:14:25,532 --> 00:14:26,784
Oh, good grief.

222
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:49,079
The automobile,

223
00:14:49,281 --> 00:14:51,778
such impressive power and speed.

224
00:14:52,545 --> 00:14:56,195
When I was young, all we had
were shabby horse-drawn carriages.

225
00:14:56,468 --> 00:14:58,916
Don't move! What do you think you're doing?

226
00:14:59,098 --> 00:15:04,024
This car belongs to U.S. senator Mr. Wilson
Phillips, and touching it results in a beat-down!

227
00:15:05,248 --> 00:15:05,749
Huh?

228
00:15:08,041 --> 00:15:10,215
What the hell is wrong with you?!

229
00:15:11,516 --> 00:15:12,210
Hmm.

230
00:15:13,866 --> 00:15:14,793
My, my.

231
00:15:14,881 --> 00:15:18,277
Young people these days are so full of piss and vinegar.

232
00:15:18,364 --> 00:15:19,832
Time's are a-changin'.

233
00:15:20,927 --> 00:15:21,378
Eh?

234
00:15:23,078 --> 00:15:24,078
Why would you?!

235
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:27,305
Stop talking now, and proceed to the front seat.

236
00:15:27,379 --> 00:15:28,799
It's time to drive.

237
00:15:28,941 --> 00:15:31,020
Just who the hell are you, sicko?!

238
00:15:31,045 --> 00:15:35,163
After I'm finished with you, you'll rue
the day you ever barged into my vehicle!

239
00:15:35,376 --> 00:15:37,289
Yeah, this is unforgivable.

240
00:15:37,403 --> 00:15:40,137
No one gets away with doing something like this to me.

241
00:15:40,193 --> 00:15:43,023
I was valedictorian in both high school and college,

242
00:15:43,088 --> 00:15:45,296
not to mention captain of the college wrestling team.

243
00:15:45,321 --> 00:15:47,806
Even after graduation, people respected me.

244
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,645
That's how I became a politician.

245
00:15:49,855 --> 00:15:52,593
I own a villa on a thousand-acre plot of land in Hawaii,

246
00:15:52,624 --> 00:15:57,329
my gorgeous model of a wife is 25 years
younger, and I pay more taxes than anyone else!

247
00:15:57,878 --> 00:16:02,444
I've destroyed every enemy who's ever stood
in my way, and someday I'll become president!

248
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:04,874
I'm the senator Wilson Phillips, damn it!

249
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:08,060
Listen to me, you punk band reject!

250
00:16:08,093 --> 00:16:10,985
I'm gonna make sure you rot in
prison for the rest of your miser...

251
00:16:11,189 --> 00:16:13,252
Hear this, as I won't repeat it.

252
00:16:16,304 --> 00:16:17,784
Drive the car.

253
00:16:20,205 --> 00:16:22,512
This psychopath's gonna kill me.

254
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:24,915
I have to get the hell out of this car.

255
00:16:25,137 --> 00:16:26,799
If I don't, I'm a goner!

256
00:16:27,238 --> 00:16:29,021
Someone, help me!

257
00:16:29,046 --> 00:16:29,574
Huh?

258
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:34,522
What the hell?!

259
00:16:36,599 --> 00:16:37,192
Huh?

260
00:16:37,716 --> 00:16:39,202
What was that?!

261
00:16:39,325 --> 00:16:43,711
I'm positive I jumped out of the car, so
what the hell am I doing back in the car?!

262
00:16:43,736 --> 00:16:46,902
I don't get it! What's going on?!

263
00:16:46,989 --> 00:16:49,433
Your job is to catch up to that truck.

264
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:52,107
Fail to do so, and you die.

265
00:16:52,191 --> 00:16:53,820
Uh, yes, sir!

266
00:16:54,393 --> 00:16:56,248
How am I still in the car?

267
00:16:56,629 --> 00:16:59,369
Of course. That's it. I'm a senator.

268
00:16:59,404 --> 00:17:00,680
What can't I do?

269
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:02,882
Yes, it makes total sense now.

270
00:17:12,063 --> 00:17:14,747
I still sense Dio's sinister blood lust.

271
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:16,589
Its presence is overwhelming.

272
00:17:17,189 --> 00:17:18,642
He's coming for us.

273
00:17:18,788 --> 00:17:20,879
You can bet your ass he's on our trail.

274
00:17:21,183 --> 00:17:24,580
Are you saying that Dio somehow
knows our precise location?

275
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:29,327
Not quite. He stole the body of
my grandfather, Jonathan Joestar.

276
00:17:29,981 --> 00:17:33,673
I can sense his body, but I can't
tell if he's nearby or far away.

277
00:17:33,812 --> 00:17:37,432
I have a general feeling, but I
don't know exactly where he is.

278
00:17:37,796 --> 00:17:42,592
It's like when we got to Cairo and, while I
knew he was here, I couldn't pinpoint his lair.

279
00:17:42,924 --> 00:17:45,364
Lucky for us, the same thing goes for Dio.

280
00:17:45,504 --> 00:17:47,511
All he knows is that we're nearby,

281
00:17:47,842 --> 00:17:50,377
but he's unable to tell the difference between us,

282
00:17:51,197 --> 00:17:54,964
and he probably doesn't know we've
separated, which is good for now.

283
00:17:57,330 --> 00:17:59,058
Why the hell isn't this working?

284
00:17:59,118 --> 00:18:02,393
Cars always start up when they
do this kind of thing in movies.

285
00:18:07,894 --> 00:18:09,751
Seems like there's a traffic jam.

286
00:18:10,357 --> 00:18:13,801
I'm sorry, sir. The evening
commute is always bumper to bumper.

287
00:18:13,885 --> 00:18:14,575
Move it.

288
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:17,982
Uh, but we're stuck here. There's just too much traffic.

289
00:18:18,690 --> 00:18:21,539
Have you forgotten there's a sidewalk? Use it.

290
00:18:21,564 --> 00:18:22,533
The sidewalk?

291
00:18:22,581 --> 00:18:25,144
B-but it's covered with people heading home from work.

292
00:18:25,846 --> 00:18:27,638
And your point? Go.

293
00:18:27,987 --> 00:18:29,163
Yes, sir.

294
00:18:31,181 --> 00:18:32,102
Faster.

295
00:18:32,179 --> 00:18:33,514
Yes, sir!

296
00:18:41,701 --> 00:18:42,803
Okay, it's running.

297
00:18:43,009 --> 00:18:44,852
Hurry up, and get on, Polnareff.

298
00:18:44,991 --> 00:18:45,945
Oh. Yeah.

299
00:18:50,563 --> 00:18:52,669
Oh, the things I do for you!

300
00:18:52,818 --> 00:18:55,530
But I've done everything you've
asked, so you'll spare my life, right?

301
00:18:55,581 --> 00:18:58,403
There's no need to kill a helpless senator!

302
00:18:58,737 --> 00:18:59,694
Wrong.

303
00:19:02,753 --> 00:19:03,997
I have to be dreaming.

304
00:19:04,043 --> 00:19:05,650
What other explanation is there?

305
00:19:05,675 --> 00:19:07,713
As if a senator like me could be killed.

306
00:19:07,753 --> 00:19:10,359
Whoo-hoo-hoo! It's just a dream!

307
00:19:11,339 --> 00:19:12,466
Found you.

308
00:19:12,498 --> 00:19:15,056
Now get closer. We need to catch up to them.

309
00:19:15,341 --> 00:19:18,182
I can't use the world if I'm this far away.

310
00:19:18,917 --> 00:19:20,248
Look. Here he comes.

311
00:19:20,379 --> 00:19:23,009
You see that car? That's Dio's ride.

312
00:19:25,204 --> 00:19:26,146
Kakyoin!

313
00:19:28,626 --> 00:19:31,014
Hmm. It's Kakyoin's...

314
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:32,449
Take this, Dio!

315
00:19:32,718 --> 00:19:33,935
Emerald splash!

316
00:19:51,853 --> 00:19:52,739
Unbelievable!

317
00:19:52,939 --> 00:19:55,527
He deflected my attack with a flick of a finger.

318
00:19:55,581 --> 00:19:57,041
He barely moved.

319
00:19:57,522 --> 00:19:58,893
But how do you like this?!

320
00:20:04,119 --> 00:20:07,606
He even dodged the concentrated splash? Damn it!

321
00:20:10,038 --> 00:20:11,653
When did he bring out his stand?

322
00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:13,293
How could I have missed that?!

323
00:20:18,326 --> 00:20:20,885
Well, that's a shame. He's too far away now.

324
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:24,614
My punch seems to have thrown
him out of the world's range.

325
00:20:28,059 --> 00:20:29,478
What's happening?!

326
00:20:29,991 --> 00:20:33,880
And what precisely would I gain
by explaining this situation to you?

327
00:20:33,965 --> 00:20:36,329
Pay attention to the road, and drive.

328
00:20:41,005 --> 00:20:42,432
Be careful, Kakyoin!

329
00:20:42,841 --> 00:20:44,724
You were way too close to it,

330
00:20:44,924 --> 00:20:47,879
Please, forgive me. I didn't mean...

331
00:20:50,145 --> 00:20:55,315
It was only a few months ago when Dio asked me
if I was "really going to vomit out of fear."

332
00:20:55,762 --> 00:20:59,069
That monster had the audacity to tell me I should relax.

333
00:20:59,632 --> 00:21:01,642
Bastard, never again.

334
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:03,535
I'll never lose to you again.

335
00:21:03,943 --> 00:21:05,481
Are you all right, Kakyoin?

336
00:21:05,544 --> 00:21:07,413
Did you catch a glimpse of the world?

337
00:21:07,927 --> 00:21:09,526
Yes, I saw it

338
00:21:09,551 --> 00:21:11,803
when I attacked Dio from ten meters away.

339
00:21:11,837 --> 00:21:14,663
If I had gotten any closer, I would have been done for.

340
00:21:14,967 --> 00:21:16,689
But we know one thing for certain.

341
00:21:16,768 --> 00:21:20,293
His stand holds a power more horrific
than we could have ever imagined.

342
00:21:21,194 --> 00:21:23,294
However, we know two things about it.

343
00:21:23,747 --> 00:21:27,999
First, his stand doesn't have the reach of
my Hierophant Green or your Hermit Purple.

344
00:21:28,307 --> 00:21:31,280
It's a close-range power stand, like Star Platinum,

345
00:21:31,447 --> 00:21:33,364
and has a range of about ten meters.

346
00:21:33,599 --> 00:21:38,270
Second, it attacked with its fist, so it
doesn't use projectile weapons, like bullets.

347
00:21:39,273 --> 00:21:42,884
That being said, if we can sneak
up on him and get within range,

348
00:21:42,962 --> 00:21:45,232
we just might have a chance of finishing him off.

349
00:21:45,732 --> 00:21:47,760
We have to figure out his secret.

350
00:21:47,818 --> 00:21:52,352
Even so, we have to exercise extreme
caution when approaching this bastard.

351
00:21:53,892 --> 00:21:54,783
Hold on.

352
00:21:54,987 --> 00:21:56,711
Why'd his car suddenly stop?

353
00:22:01,014 --> 00:22:03,240
Incoming! We're about to be hit!

354
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:09,934
Mr. Joestar!

355
00:22:37,711 --> 00:22:39,335
What are you doing, Kakyoin?

356
00:22:39,731 --> 00:22:41,075
I understand now.

357
00:22:43,234 --> 00:22:46,440
I know now how to uncover the secret of Dio's stand.
