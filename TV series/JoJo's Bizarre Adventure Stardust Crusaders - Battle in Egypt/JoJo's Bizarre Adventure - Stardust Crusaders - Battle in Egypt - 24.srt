1
00:00:03,975 --> 00:00:05,372
Just as I thought,

2
00:00:06,321 --> 00:00:08,654
Joseph's blood suits me well.

3
00:00:10,162 --> 00:00:11,712
It's like it was meant to be mine

4
00:00:11,745 --> 00:00:12,957
from the very beginning.

5
00:00:13,334 --> 00:00:16,343
It's far more intense than anything I've ever felt before!

6
00:00:16,969 --> 00:00:20,353
This sensation is absolutely incredible!

7
00:00:25,478 --> 00:00:28,955
A century ago, this body belonged to Jonathan Joestar,

8
00:00:29,146 --> 00:00:32,982
and now these hands have feasted
on the blood of his grandson, Joseph!

9
00:00:33,228 --> 00:00:36,830
But it was you, Jotaro, who so thoughtfully led me here.

10
00:00:37,094 --> 00:00:39,996
Your ancestor must be rolling in his grave.

11
00:00:40,069 --> 00:00:42,479
You Joestars have always been a nuisance,

12
00:00:42,539 --> 00:00:47,825
so I think the time has come to put you self-righteous
cretins in your proper place, beneath my boot!

13
00:00:48,151 --> 00:00:49,892
In the end, Jotaro,

14
00:00:50,085 --> 00:00:55,131
it would appear that the Joestars' destiny
is to facilitate my ascension to perfection!

15
00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:00,444
Why, you...

16
00:01:15,553 --> 00:01:16,910
Old man.

17
00:01:17,226 --> 00:01:19,170
You have to stay calm.

18
00:01:19,685 --> 00:01:23,770
From here on, no matter what
Dio does to me, keep your cool.

19
00:01:24,064 --> 00:01:29,138
Focus. Tempting as it may be, never
allow yourself to succumb to anger.

20
00:01:29,657 --> 00:01:31,896
Don't worry about my fate, Jotaro.

21
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:34,395
I've accepted that it was meant to be.

22
00:01:34,802 --> 00:01:35,751
Wait a sec.

23
00:01:36,171 --> 00:01:39,134
That's his soul? But how?

24
00:01:39,812 --> 00:01:42,996
Kakyoin deciphered the mystery of Dio's stand,

25
00:01:43,504 --> 00:01:45,721
and I imparted that knowledge to you.

26
00:01:46,174 --> 00:01:49,505
Had we attacked Dio together before learning his secret,

27
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:52,474
he would have been able to easily kill all of us.

28
00:01:52,809 --> 00:01:55,936
You now have the ability to move while time is frozen,

29
00:01:56,329 --> 00:01:58,571
but you only have two or three seconds.

30
00:01:58,932 --> 00:02:01,294
Make sure you use that time wisely.

31
00:02:01,975 --> 00:02:04,331
Remember what I told you, Jotaro.

32
00:02:04,466 --> 00:02:06,168
You mustn't lose your head.

33
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:09,121
If you lose control, it'll only backfire.

34
00:02:09,394 --> 00:02:12,258
Keep your emotions in check when you face off with Dio.

35
00:02:15,114 --> 00:02:16,073
Jotaro...

36
00:02:17,769 --> 00:02:20,311
It's been quite the journey, eh, my boy,

37
00:02:20,911 --> 00:02:23,030
an unforgettable adventure.

38
00:02:23,817 --> 00:02:24,999
Call me crazy.

39
00:02:26,039 --> 00:02:29,249
But our time together was a lot of fun,

40
00:02:29,415 --> 00:02:31,583
more fun than I've had in a long time.

41
00:02:41,791 --> 00:02:43,533
That was real, right?

42
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:44,533
Hey!

43
00:02:45,421 --> 00:02:48,385
What are you looking at, Jotaro?!

44
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:01,805
You bastard!

45
00:03:02,559 --> 00:03:04,214
He's been sucked dry.

46
00:03:10,485 --> 00:03:12,751
I know you said to keep my emotions in check,

47
00:03:13,104 --> 00:03:15,759
but screw that! He just crossed the line!

48
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:18,062
There's not a person on the planet

49
00:03:18,203 --> 00:03:20,142
who could stay calm after seeing that!

50
00:03:20,502 --> 00:03:22,462
This fight has come to an end!

51
00:05:10,076 --> 00:05:13,490
The World! Bring time to a halt!

52
00:05:16,694 --> 00:05:19,422
One second, two seconds,

53
00:05:19,747 --> 00:05:21,315
and three seconds.

54
00:05:21,415 --> 00:05:22,426
Now four...

55
00:05:31,508 --> 00:05:34,085
Five seconds. Interesting.

56
00:05:34,432 --> 00:05:37,031
Six seconds. My, my.

57
00:05:39,903 --> 00:05:41,685
This makes seven seconds.

58
00:05:41,711 --> 00:05:44,059
My power grows exponentially!

59
00:05:44,273 --> 00:05:46,664
I can stop time for even longer.

60
00:05:46,889 --> 00:05:48,694
But as for you, Jotaro,

61
00:05:48,983 --> 00:05:51,820
you wasted the opportunity you had to move.

62
00:05:52,195 --> 00:05:56,465
Gambling on getting me two seconds
before time resumed was all for naught.

63
00:05:56,661 --> 00:05:58,618
What a miscalculation.

64
00:06:00,419 --> 00:06:03,309
I feel so marvelous, I could serenade the world!

65
00:06:03,386 --> 00:06:07,019
The moment I've dreamed of for so long is finally upon us.

66
00:06:07,046 --> 00:06:08,797
Eight seconds have passed.

67
00:06:09,104 --> 00:06:11,997
I've been an immortal being for an entire century...

68
00:06:12,769 --> 00:06:17,626
But never in my wildest dreams could I have
imagined I'd feel something this exhilarating!

69
00:06:19,346 --> 00:06:22,463
The blood of the Joestars courses through my veins!

70
00:06:22,569 --> 00:06:25,111
The blood of the Joestars courses through my veins!

71
00:06:25,136 --> 00:06:25,751
Damn it.

72
00:06:26,411 --> 00:06:28,488
Guess you were right, after all, old man.

73
00:06:29,126 --> 00:06:31,594
My stupid temper got me in a shit-ton of trouble.

74
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:33,300
For Christ's sake.

75
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:35,486
No, this isn't the end!

76
00:06:35,705 --> 00:06:38,635
He still hasn't faced the full force of my rage!

77
00:06:38,843 --> 00:06:40,393
Nine seconds total,

78
00:06:40,546 --> 00:06:42,996
that's how long my power lasted just now.

79
00:06:43,217 --> 00:06:49,360
Yes, perhaps nine seconds is the new
extent of my stand's extraordinary power.

80
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:51,295
You bastard.

81
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:01,605
Now to unleash all of my stand's power!

82
00:07:01,885 --> 00:07:05,606
Jotaro, weren't you mumbling something about being angry?!

83
00:07:05,819 --> 00:07:08,006
Is this all the power you possess?!

84
00:07:09,718 --> 00:07:12,985
Muda!

85
00:07:17,275 --> 00:07:20,089
And now I shall administer the killing blow!

86
00:07:20,256 --> 00:07:23,210
Here it is, my final dance with time!

87
00:07:24,956 --> 00:07:27,902
Nine more seconds, that's all you have left!

88
00:07:28,089 --> 00:07:30,942
Prepare to die! The World!

89
00:07:44,063 --> 00:07:45,570
One second.

90
00:07:46,463 --> 00:07:48,173
Two seconds.

91
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:49,955
Three seconds.

92
00:07:50,487 --> 00:07:55,365
Jotaro couldn't figure out why Dio had
suddenly vanished amidst the standstill...

93
00:07:55,674 --> 00:07:57,307
Four seconds.

94
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:00,059
But he pushed the thoughts out of his mind.

95
00:08:01,206 --> 00:08:03,990
No matter what sinister plot Dio was hatching,

96
00:08:04,111 --> 00:08:07,025
no matter what unholy attack he attempted to unleash,

97
00:08:07,247 --> 00:08:10,018
Jotaro had only two seconds to respond,

98
00:08:10,851 --> 00:08:15,588
only two seconds to drive Star
Platinum's fists into Dio once and for all!

99
00:08:15,852 --> 00:08:17,614
Five seconds.

100
00:08:17,862 --> 00:08:20,929
I've had just about enough of this neon vampire.

101
00:08:21,202 --> 00:08:23,889
The next time I see that goddamn face of his,

102
00:08:24,028 --> 00:08:27,089
I'm gonna freakin' lose it and beat him into the ground.

103
00:08:27,529 --> 00:08:29,411
Six seconds.

104
00:08:29,537 --> 00:08:30,935
That's right, Dio.

105
00:08:31,322 --> 00:08:32,447
Come and get it.

106
00:08:33,187 --> 00:08:35,073
Seven seconds.

107
00:08:36,467 --> 00:08:39,414
I'm going to roll all over you!

108
00:08:48,625 --> 00:08:51,237
It's too late! Time to die!

109
00:08:51,313 --> 00:08:54,316
Muda! Muda! Muda! Muda...

110
00:08:54,401 --> 00:08:57,371
Ora! Ora! Ora! Ora...

111
00:08:57,396 --> 00:08:59,324
Muda! Muda! Muda! Muda...

112
00:08:59,357 --> 00:09:00,446
Eight seconds!

113
00:09:02,254 --> 00:09:04,569
I'll obliterate you!

114
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:07,360
Ora!

115
00:09:12,508 --> 00:09:14,292
Nine seconds.

116
00:09:16,492 --> 00:09:17,858
I did it.

117
00:09:18,798 --> 00:09:20,285
It's over.

118
00:09:21,082 --> 00:09:23,824
The world has defeated star platinum.

119
00:09:24,082 --> 00:09:26,805
My stand is more powerful than his.

120
00:09:27,303 --> 00:09:28,902
I am immortal.

121
00:09:29,135 --> 00:09:30,855
I am everlasting.

122
00:09:33,511 --> 00:09:35,464
Stand power!

123
00:09:39,045 --> 00:09:44,630
Now there is incontrovertible proof that no
one on this miserable planet is stronger than me.

124
00:09:44,903 --> 00:09:46,959
You loathsome humans,

125
00:09:47,252 --> 00:09:51,271
I shall rule over your pathetic
species until the end of time.

126
00:09:51,529 --> 00:09:54,132
Now bow before my wisdom and power!

127
00:09:54,421 --> 00:09:55,930
Ten seconds!

128
00:09:58,344 --> 00:09:59,670
Would you look at that?

129
00:09:59,731 --> 00:10:02,881
I can stop time for ten seconds!

130
00:10:03,067 --> 00:10:08,739
All right, now that I've defeated Jotaro, I
should inspect his lifeless body and drink his blood,

131
00:10:08,811 --> 00:10:11,425
that is, if there's any blood left to savor.

132
00:10:19,307 --> 00:10:20,832
This can't be.

133
00:10:20,857 --> 00:10:22,507
My body's slowing down.

134
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:24,323
What's happening?

135
00:10:26,234 --> 00:10:30,326
N-no. It's not that I'm slowing down.

136
00:10:30,651 --> 00:10:33,403
For some reason, I can't move at all!

137
00:10:33,578 --> 00:10:35,187
I don't get it.

138
00:10:35,275 --> 00:10:37,852
This is impossible. I'm frozen.

139
00:10:38,009 --> 00:10:40,901
Hey, Dio, it's been 11 seconds.

140
00:10:41,227 --> 00:10:43,182
I guess that's your stand's limit, huh?

141
00:10:44,175 --> 00:10:45,862
Eh, what?!

142
00:10:47,919 --> 00:10:49,798
I stopped time at nine seconds,

143
00:10:49,918 --> 00:10:51,471
and it's a good thing I did.

144
00:10:51,831 --> 00:10:53,724
It gave me a chance to escape.

145
00:10:54,412 --> 00:10:56,241
Good grief, you idiot.

146
00:10:57,711 --> 00:10:58,704
Here's the thing.

147
00:10:59,551 --> 00:11:01,146
Since you're frozen like that,

148
00:11:01,346 --> 00:11:03,525
destroying you will only take a second!

149
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:08,275
Jotaro!

150
00:11:15,879 --> 00:11:17,405
This is madness.

151
00:11:17,525 --> 00:11:19,458
You can stop time, too?

152
00:11:19,685 --> 00:11:25,389
Curse you! This whole act was a ruse to
waste my nine seconds, wasn't it, you bastard?

153
00:11:26,138 --> 00:11:28,605
How does it feel, Dio? Tell me.

154
00:11:30,426 --> 00:11:35,140
How's it feel having your archenemy tower
behind you while you stand frozen and helpless?

155
00:11:35,205 --> 00:11:38,536
I suppose it's a lot like holding
your breath while underwater,

156
00:11:38,702 --> 00:11:43,490
only someone's out to get you, and your air is
running out as you desperately swim for your life.

157
00:11:44,004 --> 00:11:49,620
And then after finally reaching the surface
and taking a breath, you get pulled right back in.

158
00:11:50,469 --> 00:11:51,886
Sound familiar?

159
00:11:52,793 --> 00:11:56,842
But after everything you've done, Dio,
you're not gonna get any sympathy from me.

160
00:11:56,935 --> 00:11:57,695
Ora!

161
00:11:59,959 --> 00:12:02,061
Time is about to start moving again.

162
00:12:13,092 --> 00:12:15,815
Compassion is something you're never gonna get from me.

163
00:12:16,222 --> 00:12:19,145
I haven't got any kindness for your sorry undead ass,

164
00:12:20,086 --> 00:12:21,415
though I gotta admit

165
00:12:21,581 --> 00:12:24,527
you look pretty pathetic writhing on the ground in agony.

166
00:12:25,198 --> 00:12:29,602
As much as I want to, killing you like this
would leave a pretty bad taste in my mouth.

167
00:12:30,398 --> 00:12:32,665
I wonder how long it'll take for you to heal.

168
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:35,962
Three seconds? Four, maybe?

169
00:12:36,323 --> 00:12:41,522
The very moment your legs are healed, Star
Platinum's headed your way to demolish you.

170
00:12:43,043 --> 00:12:45,857
If this were the wild west, the hero would say,

171
00:12:46,709 --> 00:12:51,886
"It's high noon. Now get off the ground, and
draw your piece, Dio. You're getting one shot."

172
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:57,568
This insignificant whelp,

173
00:12:57,942 --> 00:12:59,639
how dare he mock me?!

174
00:13:00,205 --> 00:13:02,147
Though I shouldn't be surprised.

175
00:13:02,562 --> 00:13:06,677
Of course he would use this opportunity
to make such a human declaration.

176
00:13:08,765 --> 00:13:10,875
You think like a true mortal,

177
00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:14,210
cursed with a fleeting life destined for obscurity.

178
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:16,818
A bad taste in your mouth, you say?

179
00:13:17,143 --> 00:13:19,609
What, are you afraid you'd regret killing me?

180
00:13:20,599 --> 00:13:23,576
That reasoning is as pathetic as your species.

181
00:13:23,697 --> 00:13:26,262
Your foolish honor will be your demise.

182
00:13:28,590 --> 00:13:30,843
That is where you and I differ.

183
00:13:31,797 --> 00:13:35,864
My vision is clear, and my
mind is focused on a single goal.

184
00:13:36,256 --> 00:13:40,130
I want to dominate, nothing more, nothing less.

185
00:13:40,353 --> 00:13:43,193
It's the only thing that will bring me fulfillment.

186
00:13:43,819 --> 00:13:46,212
But how I go about doing that...

187
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:48,723
Doesn't matter in the slightest!

188
00:13:50,658 --> 00:13:53,686
There! How about a little blood in your eyes?!

189
00:13:53,947 --> 00:13:56,052
I win! Die!

190
00:13:58,151 --> 00:14:00,062
Ora!

191
00:14:23,459 --> 00:14:25,608
What the hell?!

192
00:14:27,094 --> 00:14:28,907
It's impossible!

193
00:14:29,002 --> 00:14:31,877
I am the immortal Dio!

194
00:14:33,366 --> 00:14:37,664
I am Dio!

195
00:14:44,837 --> 00:14:47,479
When the sun comes up, you'll be nothing but dust.

196
00:14:48,054 --> 00:14:51,609
You only made one mistake, one that got you killed.

197
00:14:52,118 --> 00:14:55,774
Dio, this whole thing might have ended differently, but...

198
00:14:57,103 --> 00:14:58,751
You went and pissed me off.

199
00:14:58,831 --> 00:14:59,864
Was it worth it?

200
00:15:27,769 --> 00:15:30,016
This is Speedwagon Foundation, car two.

201
00:15:30,275 --> 00:15:33,110
We're traveling northbound on the al-nil expressway,

202
00:15:33,134 --> 00:15:35,074
and we've retrieved Dio's remains.

203
00:15:35,447 --> 00:15:38,639
I repeat. We've retrieved Dio's remains.

204
00:15:39,799 --> 00:15:41,999
Dio's body is showing cellular activity.

205
00:15:42,138 --> 00:15:44,232
He must be exposed to sunlight immediately.

206
00:15:44,433 --> 00:15:46,071
Proceed with extreme caution!

207
00:15:46,388 --> 00:15:46,939
Roger.

208
00:15:48,324 --> 00:15:50,094
Noriaki Kakyoin is dead.

209
00:15:50,225 --> 00:15:52,260
His body is being transported now.

210
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,533
Jean Pierre Polnareff is unconscious.

211
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:56,454
The medical staff of car one has him.

212
00:15:56,711 --> 00:15:57,234
Roger.

213
00:15:58,659 --> 00:16:00,189
Car two, I have a question.

214
00:16:01,249 --> 00:16:05,273
Why have you placed the remains of
Dio and Joseph Joestar in the same car?

215
00:16:07,338 --> 00:16:08,943
Because it's not over yet.

216
00:16:09,322 --> 00:16:11,148
Dio borrowed something from us...

217
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:11,868
Eh?

218
00:16:12,453 --> 00:16:15,011
And we need to take it back from the bastard.

219
00:16:15,716 --> 00:16:17,756
I'm not following your train of thought.

220
00:16:18,685 --> 00:16:22,097
I need you to perform a blood
transfusion between the two bodies.

221
00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:24,090
That's absurd!

222
00:16:24,286 --> 00:16:27,482
You want us to transfuse Dio's blood into Mr. Joestar?

223
00:16:27,569 --> 00:16:30,344
I see! You're trying to bring him back to life!

224
00:16:31,461 --> 00:16:34,315
It hasn't been all that long since Dio drained his blood.

225
00:16:35,796 --> 00:16:38,185
His upper half was destroyed in the fight,

226
00:16:38,319 --> 00:16:40,076
but we'll take as much as we can.

227
00:16:40,789 --> 00:16:42,906
If we hurry, I think we can make it.

228
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:47,103
Hey, car one, did you catch all that? Over.

229
00:16:47,789 --> 00:16:48,451
Roger.

230
00:16:48,756 --> 00:16:51,046
It's impossible! He doesn't even have a pulse.

231
00:16:51,070 --> 00:16:51,690
Right!

232
00:16:51,734 --> 00:16:56,034
Not to mention his heart has stopped, which means
we couldn't circulate his blood if we wanted to.

233
00:16:56,270 --> 00:16:57,315
Don't give me that.

234
00:16:58,299 --> 00:17:01,376
You could call everything we've
done on this journey impossible.

235
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:04,749
I'm tired of hearing words like "impossible" or "futile."

236
00:17:04,802 --> 00:17:06,406
They all mean nothing to us.

237
00:17:08,163 --> 00:17:10,223
You can do it if his heart's beating, right?

238
00:17:10,502 --> 00:17:11,698
Well, you're in luck.

239
00:17:11,722 --> 00:17:12,322
Huh?

240
00:17:12,801 --> 00:17:17,074
Thanks to Dio, I've already had a bit of
practice with stopping and starting hearts.

241
00:17:18,163 --> 00:17:19,300
Ora!

242
00:17:24,439 --> 00:17:25,645
I hear a pulse.

243
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:27,559
Yes, you're right! His heart is beating!

244
00:17:27,590 --> 00:17:30,611
We have to transfuse his blood into Mr. Joestar quickly!

245
00:17:30,691 --> 00:17:32,757
We might just be able to pull this off!

246
00:17:50,909 --> 00:17:52,229
Remarkable!

247
00:17:52,516 --> 00:17:53,730
Take a look at his skin!

248
00:17:53,822 --> 00:17:56,188
It's completely regaining all its color!

249
00:17:58,246 --> 00:17:59,700
His skin is filling out!

250
00:18:01,723 --> 00:18:04,052
My god! Brain activity, too!

251
00:18:04,372 --> 00:18:05,516
I don't believe it.

252
00:18:05,625 --> 00:18:07,553
His vitals are stable as well!

253
00:18:11,488 --> 00:18:12,181
His eyes!

254
00:18:12,215 --> 00:18:13,547
He opened his eyes!

255
00:18:13,714 --> 00:18:15,551
We did it! He's back!

256
00:18:22,069 --> 00:18:22,873
Old man?

257
00:18:33,530 --> 00:18:35,725
You're a damn fool, Jotaro.

258
00:18:36,484 --> 00:18:38,264
You have got to be kidding!

259
00:18:39,367 --> 00:18:39,834
Hmm.

260
00:18:40,015 --> 00:18:42,681
All you've done is resurrect yours truly!

261
00:18:42,751 --> 00:18:43,836
Bastard!

262
00:18:44,156 --> 00:18:45,704
Wait! Calm down, Jotaro!

263
00:18:45,729 --> 00:18:47,739
It was a joke! I was just kidding!

264
00:18:48,056 --> 00:18:49,738
There's no need to get violent!

265
00:18:50,938 --> 00:18:51,831
I'm sorry!

266
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,640
I was just trying to have some fun!

267
00:18:54,170 --> 00:18:56,237
You have my word, it's me!

268
00:18:56,364 --> 00:19:00,846
I'm Joseph Joestar! I was born September 27th in 1920!

269
00:19:00,939 --> 00:19:04,601
My wife's name is Suzie Q,
and I collect comics as a hobby!

270
00:19:05,821 --> 00:19:07,402
I have a question for you.

271
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:10,421
Who's the leading actress in "Tarzan, the ape man"?

272
00:19:10,781 --> 00:19:11,960
Bo Derek.

273
00:19:12,043 --> 00:19:13,563
Okay, now answer this one.

274
00:19:13,795 --> 00:19:15,953
Who sang "eat it," the spoof of "beat it"?

275
00:19:16,106 --> 00:19:17,671
"Weird al" yankovic.

276
00:19:18,019 --> 00:19:20,223
Good grief, it has to be you.

277
00:19:20,248 --> 00:19:22,398
Who else would know pointless crap like that?

278
00:19:24,135 --> 00:19:25,490
This is car two. Over!

279
00:19:25,908 --> 00:19:29,136
It's amazing! Mr. Joestar is back with us!

280
00:19:29,526 --> 00:19:31,400
He's come back from the brink of death!

281
00:19:31,573 --> 00:19:33,846
It's a miracle! Over!

282
00:19:35,657 --> 00:19:36,567
Hear that?

283
00:19:36,717 --> 00:19:40,795
We've taken back everything you stole from us, Dio.

284
00:20:10,071 --> 00:20:11,956
It's finally over.

285
00:20:17,612 --> 00:20:20,263
Dio took something precious from all of us.

286
00:20:20,676 --> 00:20:23,486
For a hundred years, he's taken whatever he wanted.

287
00:20:24,313 --> 00:20:27,046
His appetite for power has been insatiable.

288
00:20:27,917 --> 00:20:31,140
He's taken far too much. You realize that.

289
00:20:32,108 --> 00:20:36,507
Yeah. He's taken things from us
that'll we'll never be able to get back.

290
00:20:37,968 --> 00:20:42,592
The losses that we've endured on this
journey stretch as far as the planet itself.

291
00:20:43,465 --> 00:20:49,412
But thanks to their sacrifices, we're here
to tell the tale and carry on in their stead.

292
00:20:52,595 --> 00:20:56,430
Kakyoin, Iggy, Avdol...

293
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:58,885
It's over.

294
00:21:06,207 --> 00:21:08,295
Passengers awaiting incoming flights,

295
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:09,843
please make your way to the boarding gate.

296
00:21:09,918 --> 00:21:12,430
So you're really going back to France, Polnareff?

297
00:21:13,923 --> 00:21:17,006
This may be a bit forward, but your family's gone.

298
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:19,457
Why don't you come back with me to New York?

299
00:21:21,809 --> 00:21:24,215
Mr. Joestar, I know they're gone,

300
00:21:24,273 --> 00:21:26,643
but France is the only home I've ever known.

301
00:21:27,231 --> 00:21:28,851
It's filled with memories.

302
00:21:29,071 --> 00:21:31,906
It's a place I must return to, no matter where I go.

303
00:21:32,746 --> 00:21:37,391
But if you ever need anything, all you have
to do is call, and I'll be there in a heartbeat.

304
00:21:38,767 --> 00:21:40,254
We're gonna miss you, buddy.

305
00:21:45,446 --> 00:21:47,993
It wasn't easy, that's for damn sure,

306
00:21:48,659 --> 00:21:50,283
but I had a hell of a time,

307
00:21:50,308 --> 00:21:53,249
and I'm lucky to have been on
this adventure with you guys.

308
00:21:53,601 --> 00:21:54,430
Hmm.

309
00:21:55,197 --> 00:21:57,703
Remember, we're a team,

310
00:21:57,728 --> 00:21:59,680
and that's never gonna change.

311
00:22:01,129 --> 00:22:05,967
Calling all passengers for France
international airlines, flight 92 to Paris.

312
00:22:06,241 --> 00:22:07,936
Please proceed to gate 18.

313
00:22:08,162 --> 00:22:10,573
A bientot, you ornery bastard.

314
00:22:10,598 --> 00:22:11,841
Live long and happy.

315
00:22:11,873 --> 00:22:15,471
And you, his moody grandson, you'd better not forget me.

316
00:22:15,671 --> 00:22:21,087
We'll meet again, that is, of course, if you
don't hate my guts by then, stubborn jackass!

317
00:22:21,152 --> 00:22:25,071
We wouldn't be able to forget about
you, even if we wanted to, Polnareff.

318
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:26,690
You be well.

319
00:22:28,969 --> 00:22:29,909
Au revoir.

320
00:22:30,502 --> 00:22:31,126
Yeah.

321
00:22:31,795 --> 00:22:32,615
See you later.

322
00:22:47,803 --> 00:22:48,517
Holly!

323
00:22:49,130 --> 00:22:51,405
How are you sitting up straight all of a sudden?

324
00:22:51,430 --> 00:22:53,624
I'm feeling much better.

325
00:22:53,744 --> 00:22:55,866
I'm not sure how to put it into words.

326
00:22:56,359 --> 00:22:58,487
It's as if we could read each other's minds.

327
00:22:58,512 --> 00:22:59,029
What?

328
00:22:59,053 --> 00:23:01,553
Mom, I can feel that they're coming home to us!

329
00:23:04,978 --> 00:23:05,685
Holly!

330
00:23:06,412 --> 00:23:08,056
Papa and my Jotaro!

331
00:23:09,764 --> 00:23:11,299
They're coming home!

332
00:23:19,683 --> 00:23:20,178
Hmm?
