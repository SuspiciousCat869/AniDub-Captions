1
00:00:01,467 --> 00:00:04,300
Ah, looks like new pages are appearing.

2
00:00:04,479 --> 00:00:07,013
I wonder what'll happen next.

3
00:00:07,392 --> 00:00:11,644
The brothers delayed their trip
and took a bus four hours later,

4
00:00:11,774 --> 00:00:15,457
so they managed to avoid getting into an accident. Yippee!

5
00:00:16,009 --> 00:00:17,854
What adventures awaited them now?

6
00:00:18,038 --> 00:00:20,320
Once in Aswan, they made their discovery.

7
00:00:20,586 --> 00:00:21,641
"Oh. There they are,

8
00:00:21,666 --> 00:00:24,470
"the five bad guys," cried the brothers.

9
00:00:24,523 --> 00:00:26,005
But the brothers wondered,

10
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:27,766
"what could they be talking about?"

11
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,121
The bad guys seemed so worried.

12
00:00:30,663 --> 00:00:32,696
Hmm. I think that's them.

13
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:36,482
Little did they know they had drunk poison tea.

14
00:00:39,233 --> 00:00:40,793
Brother, check it out.

15
00:00:41,161 --> 00:00:42,421
Earth to big bro?

16
00:00:42,742 --> 00:00:43,241
Huh?

17
00:00:46,185 --> 00:00:46,740
Huh?

18
00:00:50,056 --> 00:00:51,994
So I just have to poison them.

19
00:00:56,827 --> 00:00:58,007
Listen, little bro,

20
00:00:58,225 --> 00:01:00,567
you and I are practically invincible together.

21
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:03,189
Between your clairvoyant comic stand

22
00:01:03,855 --> 00:01:06,719
and my face stand's transformative ability,

23
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:09,043
no one can get in our way!

24
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:13,066
Those guys are as good as dead.

25
00:01:13,091 --> 00:01:15,927
We possess the cards known as Thoth, the god of writing,

26
00:01:16,044 --> 00:01:17,985
and Khnum, god of creation,

27
00:01:18,098 --> 00:01:21,037
and together we are the bestest brothers ever!

28
00:03:08,065 --> 00:03:09,944
It's here in this cafe.

29
00:03:11,014 --> 00:03:12,466
Right at that table.

30
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:15,589
That's where those guys will drink their poison tea.

31
00:03:16,667 --> 00:03:19,284
Yeah, my stand, Thoth, the god of writing,

32
00:03:19,309 --> 00:03:22,772
has never been wrong about
anything when it comes to predictions.

33
00:03:32,806 --> 00:03:34,450
Well, are they gonna pull through?

34
00:03:34,878 --> 00:03:39,400
Luckily, Avdol's major arteries weren't
damaged, so he'll probably be released by tomorrow.

35
00:03:39,471 --> 00:03:43,430
But, Kakyoin, on the other hand, has
serious injuries that need to be treated.

36
00:03:43,482 --> 00:03:45,284
There's a chance he could go blind.

37
00:03:45,309 --> 00:03:46,762
That's a raw deal.

38
00:03:46,787 --> 00:03:51,392
I hate to say it, but if his condition doesn't
improve soon, we might have to leave him behind.

39
00:03:54,457 --> 00:03:55,079
Hmm?

40
00:03:57,470 --> 00:04:01,378
Hey, since there are so many cafes
nearby, how 'bout we get ourselves a drink?

41
00:04:01,407 --> 00:04:02,684
That's a great idea.

42
00:04:02,709 --> 00:04:04,200
Which one did you have in mind?

43
00:04:04,436 --> 00:04:05,015
Hmm.

44
00:04:09,709 --> 00:04:12,434
There you have it. The cigarette has spoken.

45
00:04:15,674 --> 00:04:16,778
Hello, there.

46
00:04:18,566 --> 00:04:22,003
Tell me, sirs, how may I be of service?

47
00:04:22,628 --> 00:04:24,915
Well, tea sounds good right about now.

48
00:04:25,024 --> 00:04:25,684
Same.

49
00:04:26,232 --> 00:04:28,025
Right, so three teas.

50
00:04:28,198 --> 00:04:29,476
Be back in a jiffy.

51
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:33,219
Actually, scratch that order, if you would.

52
00:04:33,306 --> 00:04:33,872
Huh?

53
00:04:33,897 --> 00:04:34,817
Hear me out.

54
00:04:34,842 --> 00:04:36,702
We're in enemy territory here.

55
00:04:36,769 --> 00:04:41,759
This is Dio's dominion, and since we don't know
when enemies will attack, we have to be cautious.

56
00:04:41,893 --> 00:04:45,528
If we let our guard down even for
a second, someone could poison us.

57
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:48,784
From this point on, we're only
drinking from bottles and cans.

58
00:04:48,829 --> 00:04:51,014
Come on. Are you serious?

59
00:04:51,039 --> 00:04:55,655
Completely. Hey, there, you can forget
the tea, and bring us colas instead.

60
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,088
Huh?

61
00:04:56,429 --> 00:04:57,996
Cola?!

62
00:04:58,304 --> 00:05:00,571
That's right. Something wrong?

63
00:05:00,924 --> 00:05:03,872
Not at all. Okay, three colas coming up.

64
00:05:03,897 --> 00:05:04,504
Hmm?

65
00:05:04,604 --> 00:05:06,138
I'll just go and grab them.

66
00:05:06,773 --> 00:05:10,230
Oh, by the way, if you don't
mind, we'll open them ourselves,

67
00:05:10,254 --> 00:05:12,762
and to make sure we're not
falling victim to any funny business,

68
00:05:12,787 --> 00:05:15,902
give us the third, fourth, and
fifth ones from the far-right side.

69
00:05:16,494 --> 00:05:18,523
Now they want unopened colas?

70
00:05:18,676 --> 00:05:20,977
How am I supposed to put poison in those?

71
00:05:21,002 --> 00:05:23,696
Was the prediction wrong? No, that can't be it.

72
00:05:23,721 --> 00:05:25,619
My brother's comic is always right.

73
00:05:26,254 --> 00:05:28,129
Damn it. I've got to get it together.

74
00:05:28,247 --> 00:05:29,737
I just have to believe.

75
00:05:30,107 --> 00:05:33,608
If I don't have absolute faith in
little bro, we won't stand a chance.

76
00:05:33,806 --> 00:05:36,592
Yes, my predictions are foolproof, brother.

77
00:05:36,769 --> 00:05:40,228
You in the apron, is this warm
cola your idea of a cold drink?

78
00:05:40,253 --> 00:05:44,549
You must assume I'm a real halfwit or something
to think I'd pay for this excuse of a beverage.

79
00:05:44,574 --> 00:05:47,300
Wait. What? The cola's really not cold?

80
00:05:47,462 --> 00:05:50,145
Sorry about the hassle. The fridge is down, so...

81
00:05:50,170 --> 00:05:52,727
Hey, don't you think you're being a little paranoid?

82
00:05:52,752 --> 00:05:55,503
Let's say, for the sake of
argument, that guy was our enemy

83
00:05:55,527 --> 00:05:59,136
and he was trying his damnedest to
slip a little poison into our drinks.

84
00:05:59,433 --> 00:06:02,179
How would he have known to come to this exact cafe?

85
00:06:02,204 --> 00:06:04,823
I mean, this city's not lacking in places to get a drink,

86
00:06:04,964 --> 00:06:06,693
and I chose this one on a whim.

87
00:06:06,749 --> 00:06:09,892
I'd understand if this were the
only cafe, but there are tons of 'em.

88
00:06:09,917 --> 00:06:12,726
My point is we can't be too careful around here.

89
00:06:12,751 --> 00:06:15,527
Well, if you're that worried,
let's go somewhere else then,

90
00:06:15,552 --> 00:06:17,371
maybe the place across the street?

91
00:06:17,396 --> 00:06:17,919
Mm.

92
00:06:19,441 --> 00:06:20,407
Fire!

93
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:23,547
What do I do? My cafe is on fire!

94
00:06:24,951 --> 00:06:28,700
Some fool left a burning cigarette
in the road, and it ignited the trash.

95
00:06:28,724 --> 00:06:29,592
Oh, boy.

96
00:06:29,838 --> 00:06:30,825
You know what?

97
00:06:30,857 --> 00:06:32,707
I think we'll take those teas after all.

98
00:06:34,686 --> 00:06:36,649
Yes, we did it.

99
00:06:37,502 --> 00:06:39,189
Ah, zut alors.

100
00:06:39,418 --> 00:06:42,341
What kind of jerk would toss
a lit cigarette near the trash?

101
00:06:42,366 --> 00:06:44,174
Really, the nerve of some people.

102
00:06:50,592 --> 00:06:52,743
Finally, they're drinking it.

103
00:06:53,552 --> 00:06:56,999
Drink it. Drink it. Drink it until it's gone.

104
00:07:00,130 --> 00:07:01,207
They drank it!

105
00:07:02,533 --> 00:07:04,082
A dog just took my cake.

106
00:07:04,107 --> 00:07:06,769
Who the hell brought a mangy mutt to a freakin' cafe?

107
00:07:10,829 --> 00:07:12,444
Iggy.

108
00:07:12,724 --> 00:07:13,969
Whose dog is this?!

109
00:07:13,994 --> 00:07:16,012
Will somebody please get this dog outta here?!

110
00:07:18,184 --> 00:07:19,988
Damn it, Iggy!

111
00:07:20,115 --> 00:07:22,677
Get back here, you fleabag!

112
00:07:24,183 --> 00:07:25,487
Damn it!

113
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:27,993
They were just about to swallow the poison.

114
00:07:28,059 --> 00:07:29,014
Dumb mutt.

115
00:07:29,173 --> 00:07:31,129
So what the hell's supposed to happen next?

116
00:07:31,485 --> 00:07:34,589
Well, thing is the page hasn't appeared yet.

117
00:07:34,987 --> 00:07:39,489
Also, while off, it wasn't entirely wrong. Be patient.

118
00:07:39,976 --> 00:07:42,744
Thoth only has the ability to see the near future,

119
00:07:42,862 --> 00:07:44,146
so Patience is key.

120
00:07:44,171 --> 00:07:45,206
Next time, then.

121
00:07:45,264 --> 00:07:48,487
When the next premonition is
revealed, we'll use it to destroy them.

122
00:07:49,501 --> 00:07:51,267
This is what we were meant to do.

123
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:54,247
Together, we're the bestest brothers ever, baby.

124
00:07:55,356 --> 00:08:00,192
"'We failed to kill them because of that darn
dog.'" "'we were so close, ' fumed the brothers."

125
00:08:00,332 --> 00:08:04,664
"The brothers were beside themselves
with anger, "'cause their plan failed,

126
00:08:04,803 --> 00:08:06,377
"but the brothers didn't give up,

127
00:08:06,445 --> 00:08:09,765
"and soon they decided to follow
the three guys and their dog.

128
00:08:10,656 --> 00:08:14,039
"While following them, they met a
man who had a very annoying face,

129
00:08:14,064 --> 00:08:16,825
"the kind of face that was just begging to be hit.

130
00:08:16,850 --> 00:08:19,977
In fact, it was the kind of face the brothers hated."

131
00:08:20,245 --> 00:08:22,581
I must have hated that face in a past life,

132
00:08:22,847 --> 00:08:26,013
and a face like that deserves a knuckle sandwich.

133
00:08:26,273 --> 00:08:28,570
"Even though he was a perfectly nice man,

134
00:08:28,595 --> 00:08:30,130
big bro punched him anyway."

135
00:08:33,539 --> 00:08:36,406
"Thus, the man with the bad face ran away"...

136
00:08:37,537 --> 00:08:41,095
"But fortunately for them," "he
dropped a wallet full of money."

137
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:45,176
"'Yay. We're rich. Whoopee!' cried Mondatta."

138
00:08:46,257 --> 00:08:47,452
What a dumb-ass.

139
00:08:47,477 --> 00:08:51,021
Yeah, thanks to that smarmy-faced fool, we're rich.

140
00:08:53,481 --> 00:08:56,036
Huh? Hey, brother, check it out.

141
00:08:56,219 --> 00:08:57,441
The new page is coming.

142
00:08:57,465 --> 00:08:58,379
Oh.

143
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:01,052
"The brothers continued their pursuit.

144
00:09:01,534 --> 00:09:07,201
"The bad guys got in their car and hurried over to the
hospital "to check on their friends Avdol and Kakyoin.

145
00:09:07,841 --> 00:09:10,417
"But they had no idea Zenyatta had made a bomb,

146
00:09:10,442 --> 00:09:13,164
"placed it an orange, and planted it in the car.

147
00:09:13,533 --> 00:09:15,809
"Jotaro was blown into a million pieces.

148
00:09:15,834 --> 00:09:17,342
"His head was split in two,

149
00:09:17,403 --> 00:09:20,048
and his blood was splattered everywhere!"

150
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:24,071
L-I-I-look how clearly the pictures in the comic came in.

151
00:09:24,096 --> 00:09:25,591
I see!

152
00:09:55,103 --> 00:09:58,840
It's true that my stand, Thoth,
can only see the near future,

153
00:09:58,932 --> 00:10:02,154
and most would see that as a disadvantage, but... heh...

154
00:10:02,709 --> 00:10:08,083
Once the prediction has been printed, it can't
be changed, no matter what anybody does, not ever.

155
00:10:08,327 --> 00:10:11,227
We're gonna blow Jotaro to smithereens.

156
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:15,399
The bomb will detonate three seconds
after he sticks his finger in to peel it.

157
00:10:15,677 --> 00:10:16,900
It's destiny.

158
00:10:20,708 --> 00:10:21,846
This is the end.

159
00:10:22,261 --> 00:10:23,594
There's no way out.

160
00:10:24,313 --> 00:10:24,966
Hmm?

161
00:10:24,991 --> 00:10:26,819
Who the hell is in our car?!

162
00:10:26,844 --> 00:10:28,819
Do you recognize this bozo?

163
00:10:28,909 --> 00:10:30,894
What? Isn't it Jotaro?

164
00:10:30,918 --> 00:10:31,734
No.

165
00:10:31,759 --> 00:10:34,148
Jotaro said he was going straight to the hospital.

166
00:10:34,215 --> 00:10:34,783
Be careful.

167
00:10:34,807 --> 00:10:35,381
Damn it.

168
00:10:35,406 --> 00:10:36,408
Don't let him get away!

169
00:10:36,433 --> 00:10:37,701
You've gotta be kidding.

170
00:10:37,726 --> 00:10:39,515
It's Joestar and Polnareff.

171
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:41,617
Whoever you are, come out this instant!

172
00:10:41,642 --> 00:10:43,506
What he said! Out of the car!

173
00:10:44,794 --> 00:10:47,033
Quit your stalling, and get out of there already!

174
00:10:47,065 --> 00:10:48,275
Make it snappy.

175
00:10:51,392 --> 00:10:53,656
Hey, hey, what's the matter with you two?

176
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:56,629
It was me. Couldn't you tell?

177
00:10:56,654 --> 00:10:57,290
Oh.

178
00:10:57,353 --> 00:10:59,773
Oh, so it was you, Jotaro.

179
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:05,733
My stand, Khnum, gives me the power of transformation.

180
00:11:05,812 --> 00:11:09,187
I can alter my height, weight,
and scent however I see fit.

181
00:11:09,371 --> 00:11:11,931
I even used my hair to recreate this hat.

182
00:11:12,736 --> 00:11:14,116
Wait. I don't get it.

183
00:11:14,168 --> 00:11:17,316
Last I heard, you said you were
going to head straight for the hospital.

184
00:11:17,341 --> 00:11:18,809
Huh? I did?

185
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:23,912
Ah, the hospital. I forgot something,
so I decided to come and get it.

186
00:11:24,032 --> 00:11:26,327
Oh, that's right. I left my wallet in the car.

187
00:11:26,575 --> 00:11:27,644
Good grief.

188
00:11:28,026 --> 00:11:30,357
Jotaro, where's your school uniform?

189
00:11:30,531 --> 00:11:31,998
Uh, uniform?

190
00:11:32,404 --> 00:11:33,639
What's he talking about?

191
00:11:33,664 --> 00:11:34,871
What school uniform?

192
00:11:35,177 --> 00:11:39,096
Nothin' personal, friend, but that's
not really a good look on you. Heh.

193
00:11:39,229 --> 00:11:41,865
Uh, ah, my outfit.

194
00:11:41,890 --> 00:11:43,039
I mean uniform.

195
00:11:43,434 --> 00:11:46,478
Well, it's actually at the dry cleaners.

196
00:11:46,503 --> 00:11:49,965
I took it in for a wash, but then
I realized I didn't have any money.

197
00:11:50,121 --> 00:11:53,061
Yeah, that'll convince them. I'm in the clear.

198
00:11:53,763 --> 00:11:55,831
That so? All right then.

199
00:11:56,224 --> 00:11:58,759
You can go ahead and hop in the car. Time to go.

200
00:12:00,357 --> 00:12:00,983
Huh?

201
00:12:01,778 --> 00:12:03,440
Oh, no, not the car.

202
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,242
Then, that would mean.

203
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:07,156
No, i-it can't be.

204
00:12:07,322 --> 00:12:09,389
If I get into the car with this face,

205
00:12:09,423 --> 00:12:12,253
that means the real Jotaro
won't be the one getting blown up.

206
00:12:12,287 --> 00:12:14,477
Instead, it'll be me!

207
00:12:15,707 --> 00:12:16,525
Shit.

208
00:12:17,009 --> 00:12:19,819
You know, it's a beautiful day out,
so I think I'll go ahead and walk...

209
00:12:19,844 --> 00:12:22,571
We don't have time to wait
for you to walk there, Jotaro.

210
00:12:22,596 --> 00:12:26,258
Things'll go a lot faster if you just
get in the car and ride over with us.

211
00:12:26,847 --> 00:12:30,041
Brother, you have to get out of there now!

212
00:12:32,629 --> 00:12:34,543
Crap, this is bad.

213
00:12:34,902 --> 00:12:38,269
I've got to undo my Jotaro disguise before it's too late.

214
00:12:38,781 --> 00:12:39,834
If I don't,

215
00:12:39,981 --> 00:12:42,833
I'll be the one who gets blown to bits instead!

216
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:44,808
That's it.

217
00:12:44,999 --> 00:12:46,687
I just need to throw it away.

218
00:12:47,798 --> 00:12:51,389
I'll covertly get rid of this one
and put another one in the car later

219
00:12:51,414 --> 00:12:55,469
so it can blow up the real Jotaro, thereby saving my ass.

220
00:12:57,035 --> 00:12:57,975
I did it.

221
00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:00,320
What a relief.

222
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:01,514
I'm safe.

223
00:13:01,974 --> 00:13:03,689
Hey, what do you know? It's Iggy.

224
00:13:03,862 --> 00:13:05,248
He's chasing our car.

225
00:13:06,088 --> 00:13:07,641
He's got an orange in his mouth.

226
00:13:07,842 --> 00:13:09,363
Did you steal that, Iggy?

227
00:13:09,609 --> 00:13:11,951
It'll make a nice gift for Kakyoin and Avdol.

228
00:13:11,976 --> 00:13:12,553
Hmm?

229
00:13:13,786 --> 00:13:14,449
Wha...

230
00:13:14,899 --> 00:13:16,954
Yow!

231
00:13:17,087 --> 00:13:18,180
Come again?

232
00:13:18,953 --> 00:13:22,481
Everything okay? Never thought
I'd hear you say something like that.

233
00:13:22,717 --> 00:13:25,342
Oh, really? That's weird. "Yow"?

234
00:13:25,367 --> 00:13:26,440
You know, "yow."

235
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:29,692
Actually, I was pointing out
that there's a "cyow" over there.

236
00:13:29,717 --> 00:13:30,677
A cow?

237
00:13:32,208 --> 00:13:35,597
Man, you sure are acting pretty peculiar today, Jotaro.

238
00:13:35,622 --> 00:13:37,493
You're usually a lot cooler.

239
00:13:37,694 --> 00:13:39,988
I hate to say this, but I've gotta wonder.

240
00:13:40,996 --> 00:13:43,831
You're not really a fake, are you, Jotaro?

241
00:13:46,982 --> 00:13:47,838
Hmm.

242
00:13:55,404 --> 00:13:59,253
G-good grief, Polnareff. What the
hell are you even talking about, man?

243
00:13:59,327 --> 00:14:01,650
By the way, are we at the hospital yet?

244
00:14:07,769 --> 00:14:11,574
Hey, Jotaro, I'm super bored, so
how about you show me that trick again?

245
00:14:11,606 --> 00:14:14,459
Hmm. A trick? Which one is that?

246
00:14:14,686 --> 00:14:16,246
What's he talking about?

247
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:18,312
The one you taught me a while back.

248
00:14:18,889 --> 00:14:20,351
You know, this one here.

249
00:14:24,965 --> 00:14:27,601
Hey, you've gotten a bit better at that, Polnareff.

250
00:14:29,903 --> 00:14:32,468
Oh, that's the trick you were talking about.

251
00:14:32,953 --> 00:14:35,308
Thank goodness. I know how to do that one.

252
00:14:35,463 --> 00:14:37,440
It's risky, but I can pull it off.

253
00:14:38,424 --> 00:14:41,237
Why didn't you say so from the
beginning? That's an easy one.

254
00:14:41,377 --> 00:14:44,736
All right. In that case, do the
one with five cigarettes, then.

255
00:14:45,569 --> 00:14:47,464
F-five cigarettes?

256
00:14:47,711 --> 00:14:51,032
Hurry it up already, would
you? I wanna see the trick again.

257
00:14:52,094 --> 00:14:53,962
Why is this happening to me?

258
00:14:54,148 --> 00:14:57,397
Damn that Jotaro, and damn his stupid party tricks!

259
00:14:58,847 --> 00:15:02,485
But if I don't at least try to do it,
they'll really think something is up.

260
00:15:02,826 --> 00:15:05,661
They're already becoming more
suspicious of me by the minute.

261
00:15:06,596 --> 00:15:11,604
And Polnareff, loathsome idiot that he is,
is seconds away from setting off the bomb.

262
00:15:11,928 --> 00:15:14,427
All right, fine. Damn it.

263
00:15:15,048 --> 00:15:16,016
I'll do it!

264
00:15:18,648 --> 00:15:20,854
Have it your way. Five cigarettes.

265
00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:29,619
That's the way. Now come on. Do the trick.

266
00:15:29,845 --> 00:15:32,045
All right, it's now or never.

267
00:15:32,245 --> 00:15:35,110
I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna do the trick, damn it.

268
00:15:35,190 --> 00:15:36,972
Here goes nothing!

269
00:15:38,826 --> 00:15:39,464
Hot.

270
00:15:40,091 --> 00:15:41,912
H-hot. Hot.

271
00:15:42,832 --> 00:15:43,916
I did it!

272
00:15:43,942 --> 00:15:46,168
Hot damn, I did it!

273
00:15:46,592 --> 00:15:48,152
Ah!

274
00:15:48,896 --> 00:15:51,245
There. Did you see that? I did it!

275
00:15:51,381 --> 00:15:54,184
A man can do anything when his life is on the line.

276
00:15:54,251 --> 00:15:55,053
Here.

277
00:15:55,459 --> 00:15:57,253
Last time, you did this super cool move

278
00:15:57,278 --> 00:16:00,291
where you drank a bottle of juice
without putting the cigarettes out.

279
00:16:05,894 --> 00:16:07,491
Come on. Drink up.

280
00:16:15,291 --> 00:16:16,835
Aw, you blew it!

281
00:16:17,261 --> 00:16:20,530
Jotaro, are you all right? Oh, my god!

282
00:16:21,223 --> 00:16:24,231
Brother! Brother! Please, little bro,

283
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:26,612
make that prediction go away right now!

284
00:16:26,637 --> 00:16:28,529
Tear up that page!

285
00:16:29,177 --> 00:16:32,270
Sorry, big bro, but the prediction can't be changed.

286
00:16:32,303 --> 00:16:34,357
Hurry, and go back to your regular self.

287
00:16:34,382 --> 00:16:38,324
If you can undo the disguise, the
real Jotaro will get blown up instead.

288
00:16:38,375 --> 00:16:40,110
I believe in you, brother.

289
00:16:42,756 --> 00:16:46,750
Jotaro, I know we've said this already,
but you're acting really weird today.

290
00:16:46,875 --> 00:16:48,010
It's nothing.

291
00:16:48,423 --> 00:16:50,756
I just feel a little under the weather is all.

292
00:16:51,092 --> 00:16:52,600
Hmm.

293
00:16:55,504 --> 00:16:56,443
Eh?

294
00:16:56,468 --> 00:16:58,990
Crap. This couldn't get any worse.

295
00:16:59,451 --> 00:17:04,906
I know their type. Since I've put them on guard,
they're gonna interrogate me and realize I'm an imposter.

296
00:17:05,378 --> 00:17:07,473
If they figure me out, they'll kill me,

297
00:17:07,498 --> 00:17:11,327
and if I don't undo my disguise, I'll
blow up just like the prophecy said.

298
00:17:11,683 --> 00:17:12,127
Ah?

299
00:17:13,665 --> 00:17:18,066
That's it. I'll just pretend I'm sick and
make them let me out of the car to relieve myself.

300
00:17:18,519 --> 00:17:19,326
Brilliant.

301
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:23,675
Jotaro, I couldn't help but notice
the way you're clasping your hands.

302
00:17:25,467 --> 00:17:29,107
Aha! Are you aware you've got your
left thumb on top of the others?!

303
00:17:29,132 --> 00:17:30,154
Well, are you?!

304
00:17:30,876 --> 00:17:31,495
Hmph!

305
00:17:33,142 --> 00:17:35,268
Damn it. I wasn't prepared for this.

306
00:17:35,395 --> 00:17:39,846
Does Jotaro have a weird tic that causes him
to clasp his hands with his right thumb on top?

307
00:17:40,115 --> 00:17:42,550
Who even notices something like that?

308
00:17:42,858 --> 00:17:44,105
What am I gonna do?

309
00:17:45,721 --> 00:17:49,619
That just proves beyond a shadow of a
doubt that you were a woman in a past life!

310
00:17:50,059 --> 00:17:55,473
And since, unlike you, I always put my right thumb
on top, it proves that I was a man in my past life.

311
00:17:55,498 --> 00:17:57,343
Wow, now how about that?

312
00:17:57,368 --> 00:17:59,462
I always put my left thumb on top, as well.

313
00:17:59,487 --> 00:18:03,437
Sorry, Mr. Joestar, but that proves
you, too, were a woman in a past life.

314
00:18:03,462 --> 00:18:05,581
Says you. How does it prove anything?

315
00:18:05,981 --> 00:18:08,451
How do thumbs factor into reincarnation?

316
00:18:08,476 --> 00:18:09,851
That's so stupid.

317
00:18:15,247 --> 00:18:17,431
Now I really do feel sick.

318
00:18:17,686 --> 00:18:20,823
These rabid lunatics are driving me up the wall.

319
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:24,696
All right, I'll tell them I've got a stomachache.

320
00:18:25,239 --> 00:18:29,514
Jotaro, what do you say we find out which
one of us can eat an orange the fastest?

321
00:18:29,574 --> 00:18:30,367
Say what?

322
00:18:31,408 --> 00:18:32,975
Hey, maybe you...

323
00:18:33,728 --> 00:18:36,345
Stop it! Don't do that, you idiot!

324
00:18:36,370 --> 00:18:39,091
Whoa there! What the hell are you doing, Jotaro?

325
00:18:39,686 --> 00:18:42,146
What's going on with you today, Jotaro?

326
00:18:43,538 --> 00:18:45,431
Oh, it's nothing, guys.

327
00:18:45,799 --> 00:18:47,448
But this isn't like you at all.

328
00:18:47,473 --> 00:18:50,192
I just don't think it's good for
you to eat that particular orange.

329
00:18:50,217 --> 00:18:51,727
What's the problem with it?

330
00:18:51,752 --> 00:18:53,931
Well, it's obvious, isn't it?

331
00:18:54,051 --> 00:18:56,330
Who knows where the heck Iggy found that thing?

332
00:18:56,590 --> 00:18:58,939
For all we know, he could have dug it out of the gutter.

333
00:18:59,253 --> 00:19:00,424
You should eat a different one.

334
00:19:00,457 --> 00:19:04,110
Thanks for caring, but it doesn't look
bruised or dirty, so I think I'll be fine.

335
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:06,557
I'll eat this one, and you can have one of those.

336
00:19:06,582 --> 00:19:09,249
I can't wait to see the look on your face when I win.

337
00:19:09,274 --> 00:19:11,051
Ow! The pain!

338
00:19:11,075 --> 00:19:11,750
Huh?!

339
00:19:11,775 --> 00:19:12,606
Hey, what's wrong?

340
00:19:12,631 --> 00:19:15,241
Please, stop the car. I have to go to the bathroom.

341
00:19:15,857 --> 00:19:18,311
Come on. Stop the car! Hurry!

342
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:21,328
Does your stomach really hurt that bad?

343
00:19:22,348 --> 00:19:24,148
I can't hold it anymore!

344
00:19:24,201 --> 00:19:27,355
Let me out! Let me out! I'll go behind that rock!

345
00:19:27,471 --> 00:19:29,829
The hospital's right there. Just hang on.

346
00:19:29,949 --> 00:19:31,802
No, no, go on ahead without me.

347
00:19:31,827 --> 00:19:33,576
I'll catch up once I'm done. Ohh!

348
00:19:38,352 --> 00:19:39,954
Not so fast, Jotaro.

349
00:20:00,981 --> 00:20:01,927
Take this. It's...

350
00:20:01,987 --> 00:20:02,661
Yes!

351
00:20:04,127 --> 00:20:06,926
I did it! I can't believe I did it!

352
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:11,394
I actually managed to get out
of that metal deathtrap alive!

353
00:20:11,419 --> 00:20:14,553
I'll go behind that rock and undo my disguise.

354
00:20:16,930 --> 00:20:18,273
He brought up a good point.

355
00:20:18,312 --> 00:20:20,173
Who knows where Iggy found this orange?

356
00:20:20,198 --> 00:20:22,631
For all we know, it could have been lying in the gutter.

357
00:20:23,151 --> 00:20:24,579
Do you wanna eat it?

358
00:20:24,919 --> 00:20:26,294
Nah. You can toss it.

359
00:20:30,527 --> 00:20:31,855
Success!

360
00:20:31,895 --> 00:20:35,083
Now I can use Khnum's powers to transform back to normal.

361
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:37,233
After that, they'll get what's comin' to 'em,

362
00:20:37,271 --> 00:20:40,207
and the Zenyatta Mondatta brothers will have won again.

363
00:20:40,898 --> 00:20:41,843
We win.

364
00:20:43,978 --> 00:20:46,922
Uh...

365
00:20:51,067 --> 00:20:53,774
Are you kidding me?!

366
00:20:59,714 --> 00:21:01,865
Huh? Did you hear that sound?

367
00:21:01,945 --> 00:21:04,480
Just forget it. It was probably construction.

368
00:21:07,215 --> 00:21:09,666
Oh! Big bro, are you okay?

369
00:21:11,032 --> 00:21:12,520
Speak to me.

370
00:21:12,828 --> 00:21:14,315
Hey, little bro.

371
00:21:14,469 --> 00:21:17,499
I think we lost this battle bad, really bad.

372
00:21:17,888 --> 00:21:19,287
No, big brother.

373
00:21:19,902 --> 00:21:21,277
No, no way.

374
00:21:21,429 --> 00:21:24,632
Those wannabes haven't beaten me and my stand Thoth yet.

375
00:21:24,869 --> 00:21:27,349
I-I'll destroy them all, brother,

376
00:21:27,422 --> 00:21:29,224
by myself, if I have to.

377
00:21:31,412 --> 00:21:32,507
No, don't.

378
00:21:33,888 --> 00:21:35,314
Don't do this, brother.

379
00:21:35,617 --> 00:21:39,672
These guys aren't some rookies
you can push around. You'll die.

380
00:21:39,697 --> 00:21:43,218
I've already decided, and I can beat them on my own.

381
00:21:43,535 --> 00:21:44,717
I know I can.

382
00:21:45,485 --> 00:21:47,292
You were always so shy.

383
00:21:47,475 --> 00:21:49,912
You've really grown up, little bro.

384
00:21:51,464 --> 00:21:52,857
I'm gonna kill 'em all.

385
00:21:53,374 --> 00:21:55,457
What does the book of Thoth say next?

386
00:21:56,097 --> 00:21:57,376
Huh?

387
00:21:58,138 --> 00:21:59,824
This is them, all right!

388
00:22:00,031 --> 00:22:03,618
They're the ones who punched me and
purloined my wallet while they were at it.

389
00:22:03,643 --> 00:22:08,604
All right, men, beat them to a bloody pulp,
and I'll make sure you're rewarded handsomely.

390
00:22:09,618 --> 00:22:10,986
It's him again!

391
00:22:11,011 --> 00:22:12,303
I'm scared, brother!

392
00:22:12,412 --> 00:22:14,136
This doesn't look good for us!

393
00:22:15,071 --> 00:22:18,448
"Despite his intense, yet short-lived, burst of bravery."

394
00:22:18,593 --> 00:22:21,629
"Mondatta would have to wait
a while to avenge his brother."

395
00:22:21,729 --> 00:22:27,640
"But try not to lose heart, Mondatta.
Life is full of wonderful ups and terrible downs."

396
00:22:29,984 --> 00:22:30,554
Huh?

397
00:22:30,579 --> 00:22:32,544
Well, if it isn't Jotaro.

398
00:22:32,569 --> 00:22:33,243
Hmm?

399
00:22:33,615 --> 00:22:35,015
Hey, what took so long?

400
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:36,418
Forget that.

401
00:22:36,543 --> 00:22:39,311
How'd you take a dump behind that rock so fast?

402
00:22:39,335 --> 00:22:39,830
Huh?

403
00:22:39,854 --> 00:22:41,923
I can't believe you got here before us.

404
00:22:42,156 --> 00:22:44,681
You even found time to go to the dry cleaners.

405
00:22:44,901 --> 00:22:46,836
What the hell are you two talking about?

406
00:22:47,083 --> 00:22:47,543
Hey,

407
00:22:47,568 --> 00:22:48,844
it's an ambulance.

408
00:22:48,943 --> 00:22:50,144
Someone must be hurt.

409
00:22:50,425 --> 00:22:52,148
Ah, man, that's unfortunate.

410
00:22:52,321 --> 00:22:54,618
Hmm? Oranges, huh?

411
00:22:55,031 --> 00:22:56,485
I was just getting thirsty.

412
00:22:57,206 --> 00:22:58,375
Think I'll take one.

413
00:22:59,421 --> 00:22:59,928
Huh?

414
00:23:00,654 --> 00:23:01,654
What's this?

415
00:23:01,876 --> 00:23:03,726
That man's clothes...

416
00:23:04,653 --> 00:23:05,819
You recognize him?

417
00:23:06,653 --> 00:23:08,412
Nope, can't say that I do.

418
00:23:08,789 --> 00:23:12,340
Right. Let's go find out how Avdol and Kakyoin are doing.

419
00:23:14,221 --> 00:23:17,029
"And so the brothers" eventually gave up on their mission.

420
00:23:17,169 --> 00:23:20,422
"The battle was over, and
after all the chaos and the pain,

421
00:23:20,508 --> 00:23:23,111
Jotaro and the others were none the wiser."

422
00:23:23,278 --> 00:23:24,434
Ba-dum-tss.
