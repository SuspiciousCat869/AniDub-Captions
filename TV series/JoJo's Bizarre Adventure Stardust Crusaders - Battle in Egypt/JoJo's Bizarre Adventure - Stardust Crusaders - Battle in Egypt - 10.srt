1
00:00:01,213 --> 00:00:02,153
Ponder this.

2
00:00:02,259 --> 00:00:04,170
What walks on four legs in the morning,

3
00:00:04,238 --> 00:00:07,026
two during midday, and three in the evening?

4
00:00:07,819 --> 00:00:10,072
So goes the riddle of the Sphinx,

5
00:00:10,105 --> 00:00:12,377
the legendary guardian of the pyramids.

6
00:00:12,671 --> 00:00:14,372
The answer: Man.

7
00:00:14,685 --> 00:00:19,184
Travelers who answer the riddle incorrectly
are devoured by the ravenous Sphinx.

8
00:00:19,925 --> 00:00:22,685
Now 30,000 kilometers from Japan,

9
00:00:22,977 --> 00:00:26,955
Jotaro and crew have finally
reached their destination, Cairo.

10
00:00:27,675 --> 00:00:29,122
Cairo is massive.

11
00:00:29,182 --> 00:00:32,132
It's in our best interest to
systematically search the city,

12
00:00:32,184 --> 00:00:33,858
working our way toward the center.

13
00:00:40,063 --> 00:00:41,364
We're finally here.

14
00:00:47,698 --> 00:00:50,006
Jotaro and the others have reached Cairo.

15
00:00:51,079 --> 00:00:53,889
However, before the team can reach Dio,

16
00:00:54,002 --> 00:00:58,513
they must first navigate their way through
the many "sphinxes" that stand before them.

17
00:01:05,804 --> 00:01:06,744
Hmm.

18
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:12,571
Very nice to meet you gentlemen.

19
00:01:12,966 --> 00:01:14,138
What'll you have to drink?

20
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:16,113
There's something we'd like to ask you.

21
00:01:18,192 --> 00:01:20,911
My associates and I are trying to locate this building.

22
00:01:21,127 --> 00:01:22,617
Any idea where it is?

23
00:01:23,671 --> 00:01:26,356
Joseph and the others were utterly exhausted.

24
00:01:26,709 --> 00:01:31,332
They had been searching for the building in
the photograph ever since their arrival in Cairo.

25
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:35,812
Taken with Joseph's psychic photography,

26
00:01:35,885 --> 00:01:38,195
the image revealed Dio's whereabouts.

27
00:01:38,809 --> 00:01:41,209
Dio had recently moved to a new hideout,

28
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,775
and the Speedwagon foundation couldn't find him.

29
00:01:44,422 --> 00:01:45,993
Where was Dio hiding?

30
00:01:46,826 --> 00:01:51,049
Failure to locate him as soon as
possible would spell certain doom for Holly.

31
00:01:52,656 --> 00:01:54,049
I'm sorry, stranger,

32
00:01:54,494 --> 00:01:55,941
but this is a cafe.

33
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:58,467
You should order a drink before asking questions.

34
00:01:59,347 --> 00:02:01,286
Then iced teas, four of 'em.

35
00:02:05,597 --> 00:02:06,329
Hmm.

36
00:02:14,534 --> 00:02:15,806
Never seen the place.

37
00:02:24,586 --> 00:02:25,299
Hmm.

38
00:02:25,519 --> 00:02:27,439
Cairo is a city of six million,

39
00:02:27,545 --> 00:02:30,326
so there must be at least two or three million buildings.

40
00:02:30,399 --> 00:02:31,774
How are we gonna find him?

41
00:02:32,205 --> 00:02:33,379
We know he's here.

42
00:02:33,492 --> 00:02:35,439
There must be someone who can help us.

43
00:02:38,086 --> 00:02:39,545
This is the building, huh?

44
00:02:39,821 --> 00:02:41,572
This picture doesn't tell me anything.

45
00:02:41,723 --> 00:02:43,894
Sorry, man, but it doesn't look familiar.

46
00:02:44,645 --> 00:02:47,037
I see. Sorry to bother you.

47
00:02:47,981 --> 00:02:50,556
Let's go. We'll try somewhere else.

48
00:02:55,654 --> 00:02:58,775
I happen to know where your little building is located.

49
00:03:02,993 --> 00:03:06,297
To be honest with you, I'm quite familiar with it.

50
00:04:53,456 --> 00:04:54,475
W-was that you?

51
00:04:54,817 --> 00:04:56,222
Were you the one who said that?

52
00:04:56,519 --> 00:04:58,744
Do you actually know where the building is?

53
00:04:59,996 --> 00:05:00,741
Yes.

54
00:05:00,765 --> 00:05:01,265
Huh?

55
00:05:01,511 --> 00:05:04,131
The exact location of the building in question

56
00:05:04,255 --> 00:05:06,771
is information readily available to me.

57
00:05:07,303 --> 00:05:09,367
Are you serious? That's incredible!

58
00:05:09,438 --> 00:05:10,714
What remarkable news!

59
00:05:10,739 --> 00:05:15,919
Amazing! What are the odds that we would stumble
upon someone who knows exactly where the building is?

60
00:05:16,185 --> 00:05:17,600
Well, don't keep us in suspense.

61
00:05:17,653 --> 00:05:18,829
Where's it located?

62
00:05:26,837 --> 00:05:29,279
Are you really expecting something for nothing?

63
00:05:29,574 --> 00:05:31,818
Eh, yes, you bring up a good point.

64
00:05:31,895 --> 00:05:34,393
My apologies. £10 for your help?

65
00:05:34,877 --> 00:05:36,346
Now, then, where is it?

66
00:05:40,418 --> 00:05:41,151
Hmm?

67
00:05:41,519 --> 00:05:44,473
Thing is, I'm something of a gambling man.

68
00:05:44,584 --> 00:05:49,904
I've been known to be a sucker for cheap thrills,
and some would even go so far as to say I'm an addict.

69
00:05:49,968 --> 00:05:53,681
However, when all's said and done,
gambling's how I make my living.

70
00:05:54,394 --> 00:05:57,255
Tell me, any of you boys like to gamble?

71
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:00,428
I'm not sure I fully understand
what you're trying to get at.

72
00:06:01,092 --> 00:06:02,907
I thought I'd laid it out plainly.

73
00:06:02,946 --> 00:06:05,110
If you don't like gambling, then say so.

74
00:06:05,163 --> 00:06:08,672
For the last time, I have no
idea where you're going with this.

75
00:06:08,999 --> 00:06:13,901
Oh, all right. What I'm asking is if you and
your friends would like to play a little game.

76
00:06:14,378 --> 00:06:17,074
Win, and I'll tell you the location of your building.

77
00:06:17,525 --> 00:06:19,031
It's as simple as that.

78
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:20,134
A bet?

79
00:06:20,232 --> 00:06:25,024
Look, friend, I'm as lucky as the next guy, but I'm
afraid that we don't have time for poker right now.

80
00:06:25,215 --> 00:06:27,902
If I throw in another £20, will you tell us?

81
00:06:28,115 --> 00:06:29,244
No need to worry.

82
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,354
A bet can be anything, after all.

83
00:06:31,436 --> 00:06:33,149
It won't take very long.

84
00:06:34,391 --> 00:06:37,462
For example, take a look at that wall over there.

85
00:06:37,495 --> 00:06:38,743
Do you see that cat?

86
00:06:43,688 --> 00:06:46,450
So two pieces of dried fish.

87
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:49,962
Question is, which of the two will the cat eat first,

88
00:06:51,128 --> 00:06:53,392
the right one or the left one?

89
00:06:53,905 --> 00:06:57,402
I must say there's something
thrilling about its simplicity.

90
00:06:58,333 --> 00:06:58,984
Hey!

91
00:06:59,173 --> 00:07:01,314
I've had just about enough of your games,

92
00:07:01,388 --> 00:07:04,513
so take the money, and tell us
what we wanna know, you bastard!

93
00:07:04,921 --> 00:07:06,503
Take it down a notch, Polnareff.

94
00:07:06,528 --> 00:07:08,736
That's not the way you ask someone for a favor.

95
00:07:09,578 --> 00:07:12,244
Fine! If it'll make you shut up, I'll take the bet!

96
00:07:12,304 --> 00:07:14,239
The cat'll choose the piece of fish on the right!

97
00:07:14,264 --> 00:07:17,108
Okay. Now it's getting interesting.

98
00:07:17,133 --> 00:07:19,471
I'll be placing my bet on the left.

99
00:07:19,906 --> 00:07:21,181
Polnareff...

100
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:25,698
Say, Jotaro, are you getting a strange feeling from him?

101
00:07:25,943 --> 00:07:28,899
I am. He might be an enemy stand user,

102
00:07:29,690 --> 00:07:32,350
that, or he could just be a compulsive gambler.

103
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,483
If he does anything at all that seems suspicious,

104
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:37,943
you should immediately attack him with star platinum.

105
00:07:38,002 --> 00:07:38,863
Understood.

106
00:07:40,072 --> 00:07:41,245
Let's say I lose.

107
00:07:41,269 --> 00:07:44,104
It's fairly obvious that I'll
owe you a hefty amount of money,

108
00:07:44,129 --> 00:07:45,583
so would £100 do?

109
00:07:45,617 --> 00:07:47,158
I've no use for money,

110
00:07:47,978 --> 00:07:50,510
but what would you say to giving me your soul?

111
00:07:50,574 --> 00:07:52,044
That should do just fine.

112
00:07:53,206 --> 00:07:54,027
Huh?!

113
00:07:54,892 --> 00:07:57,431
Ugh! Now the bastard thinks he's a comedian.

114
00:07:57,798 --> 00:08:00,927
I wish we could get the hell out
of here and away from this freak.

115
00:08:01,183 --> 00:08:01,806
Well?

116
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,900
Yeah, yeah, that's fine with me.

117
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,473
We'll do things your way.

118
00:08:07,981 --> 00:08:11,980
Ah, it appears the cat has taken notice of the fish.

119
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,909
Like I thought.

120
00:08:14,315 --> 00:08:17,136
Hah! He's going after the one on the right.

121
00:08:17,776 --> 00:08:20,393
If I were a cat, I'd pick the bigger piece of meat,

122
00:08:20,657 --> 00:08:23,124
and lucky for me, that's the one on the right!

123
00:08:35,915 --> 00:08:37,155
And there you have it.

124
00:08:37,274 --> 00:08:40,692
Our feline friend took the left, then the right, then ran.

125
00:08:40,914 --> 00:08:42,542
I win this round, gentlemen.

126
00:08:42,567 --> 00:08:45,068
Boy, you've outdone yourself this time, Polnareff.

127
00:08:45,093 --> 00:08:46,248
I hope you're thrilled.

128
00:08:46,417 --> 00:08:50,626
How exactly are we going to get the information
on the building's whereabouts out of him now?

129
00:08:51,593 --> 00:08:56,100
Well, if there's nothing else, as
per our agreement, it's time to pay up.

130
00:08:56,178 --> 00:08:58,578
Huh? Pay? With what?

131
00:08:59,137 --> 00:09:00,917
Your soul, of course.

132
00:09:01,573 --> 00:09:04,839
Surely you didn't forget about our wager, Polnareff.

133
00:09:05,364 --> 00:09:06,693
I want your soul,

134
00:09:06,718 --> 00:09:09,796
as I'm a stand user who prides himself on stealing them.

135
00:09:11,011 --> 00:09:15,070
I find that it's far easier to take a
person's soul if they lose it in a bet,

136
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:18,871
which is when my stand's power
activates and collects what's mine.

137
00:09:23,314 --> 00:09:24,549
What the hell?!

138
00:09:24,635 --> 00:09:26,977
My god, what's happening?!

139
00:09:27,018 --> 00:09:27,972
Polnareff!

140
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:32,290
Now, now, I wouldn't be so
quick to lash out if I were you.

141
00:09:32,663 --> 00:09:37,632
I know you desperately want to kill me, but
if I die, Polnareff will meet the same end.

142
00:09:38,131 --> 00:09:38,979
Polnareff!

143
00:09:39,651 --> 00:09:40,891
No. No!

144
00:09:41,978 --> 00:09:43,950
H-he has no pulse.

145
00:09:44,401 --> 00:09:47,448
He's dead! Polnareff is dead!

146
00:09:48,642 --> 00:09:51,528
Polnareff!

147
00:10:08,919 --> 00:10:09,778
Have a look.

148
00:10:09,848 --> 00:10:11,950
Polnareff's soul resides in this.

149
00:10:12,117 --> 00:10:16,314
Now lord Dio has one less meddlesome
fool to interfere with his plans,

150
00:10:16,347 --> 00:10:18,516
and what a fool he was.

151
00:10:20,316 --> 00:10:22,720
Please allow me to introduce myself.

152
00:10:22,745 --> 00:10:28,270
My name is D'arby, d-a-r-b-y.

153
00:10:28,493 --> 00:10:30,722
There's an apostrophe after the "d."

154
00:10:31,972 --> 00:10:34,666
Gambler, stealer of defeated souls,

155
00:10:34,829 --> 00:10:37,075
and user of the Osiris stand.

156
00:10:41,272 --> 00:10:43,989
I believe you've had the pleasure of meeting my cat.

157
00:10:44,409 --> 00:10:46,293
What is this, you bastard?!

158
00:10:48,199 --> 00:10:49,500
You call that a bet?

159
00:10:49,525 --> 00:10:51,587
How dare you, you vile, cheating son of a...

160
00:10:51,612 --> 00:10:52,840
A cheater, you say?

161
00:10:53,082 --> 00:10:58,296
Have you considered Polnareff lost because he
lacked insight to consider all the possibilities?

162
00:10:59,489 --> 00:11:00,325
Hear me out.

163
00:11:00,502 --> 00:11:05,236
Gambling is nothing more than a simple
analogy for man's relationship with his brethren,

164
00:11:05,765 --> 00:11:08,604
a dance of deception where the loser cries first.

165
00:11:09,597 --> 00:11:12,676
Are you planning to kill me
with your own two hands, Avdol?

166
00:11:13,533 --> 00:11:17,063
Go right ahead, if you don't mind
your friend's soul being lost forever.

167
00:11:17,088 --> 00:11:19,045
The choice is completely up to you.

168
00:11:19,455 --> 00:11:23,633
Know this. We're not just going to
let you waltz out of here in one piece.

169
00:11:24,355 --> 00:11:29,080
Try to think back to September 22, 1984, 11:15 P.M.

170
00:11:29,167 --> 00:11:31,950
Remember what you were doing during that time and date?

171
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:33,699
What does that even mean?!

172
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:37,777
I remember it quite clearly.

173
00:11:39,837 --> 00:11:42,707
I was in California gambling against an American

174
00:11:42,767 --> 00:11:44,842
that went by the name of Stephen Moor.

175
00:11:45,169 --> 00:11:47,866
He said the same thing you just said a moment ago...

176
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:54,841
But now he's singing a more silent tune.

177
00:11:56,074 --> 00:12:00,029
The chip below him is his father,
and the one next to him is his wife.

178
00:12:01,309 --> 00:12:03,301
If you want Polnareff's soul back,

179
00:12:03,326 --> 00:12:06,020
you have no choice but to continue our game.

180
00:12:06,610 --> 00:12:08,649
How much is his life worth to you?

181
00:12:10,055 --> 00:12:12,171
This man is evil incarnate.

182
00:12:12,356 --> 00:12:15,234
So that's it. He wants to capture our souls.

183
00:12:17,161 --> 00:12:18,667
So what's it gonna be?

184
00:12:18,843 --> 00:12:20,997
You can leave if you're too scared to play.

185
00:12:21,239 --> 00:12:23,713
I'll hold Polnareff here for safekeeping.

186
00:12:25,941 --> 00:12:29,434
Why don't you fine gentlemen have
a drink and think things over a bit?

187
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,610
Care for a piece of chocolate?

188
00:12:41,466 --> 00:12:41,984
Hmm?

189
00:12:49,242 --> 00:12:50,802
What is this, Mr. Joestar?

190
00:12:51,103 --> 00:12:52,830
What are you trying to accomplish?

191
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:54,829
I'm curious.

192
00:12:54,854 --> 00:12:58,501
Do you have any idea what surface tension is, Barbie?

193
00:12:58,743 --> 00:13:01,833
My name's D'arby. You know it's not Barbie.

194
00:13:02,713 --> 00:13:07,776
And I assume you're referring to how the liquor
appears to almost overflow, but stays in the glass.

195
00:13:07,863 --> 00:13:10,338
So is there a point to all this build-up?

196
00:13:10,525 --> 00:13:11,819
We're playing a game.

197
00:13:12,037 --> 00:13:15,536
The rules are simple: We take
turns dropping coins into the glass.

198
00:13:16,042 --> 00:13:18,307
Whoever makes the liquor spill loses.

199
00:13:18,429 --> 00:13:19,193
Old man...

200
00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:21,750
Mr. Joestar, you're not going to...

201
00:13:23,758 --> 00:13:26,635
Exactly right! I'm going to bet my soul!

202
00:13:34,442 --> 00:13:37,325
Exactly right! I'm going to bet my soul!

203
00:13:37,468 --> 00:13:38,305
Okay.

204
00:13:38,478 --> 00:13:40,045
You've got to be kidding!

205
00:13:40,124 --> 00:13:42,195
You can't go through with it, Mr. Joestar!

206
00:13:42,248 --> 00:13:43,630
This man is a good-for-nothing cheater!

207
00:13:43,657 --> 00:13:45,125
He won't cheat me this time

208
00:13:45,186 --> 00:13:47,745
I decided on the rules myself, so I'll be fine.

209
00:13:47,941 --> 00:13:50,207
Jotaro, you watch for funny business.

210
00:13:51,399 --> 00:13:52,260
Okay.

211
00:13:52,417 --> 00:13:55,338
Since you're so determined, I'll accept your conditions.

212
00:13:55,699 --> 00:13:57,466
However, before we begin,

213
00:13:57,738 --> 00:14:00,492
would you mind if I inspect the glass and coins?

214
00:14:00,681 --> 00:14:02,201
Sure. Have at it.

215
00:14:02,635 --> 00:14:05,316
You have the right to ensure
that I'm playing on the up and up.

216
00:14:06,955 --> 00:14:09,121
Hmm. Hmm.

217
00:14:13,183 --> 00:14:14,113
A question...

218
00:14:14,244 --> 00:14:18,677
What guarantee do I have that you'll
return Polnareff's soul if you lose the game?

219
00:14:22,414 --> 00:14:25,453
You've my word as a gambler that I'll keep my promise.

220
00:14:25,513 --> 00:14:28,534
If I lose, I assure you that I will pay in full,

221
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:29,796
but I won't lose.

222
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,486
Well, in that case, you can go first.

223
00:14:33,511 --> 00:14:35,159
Go ahead, and drop a coin in.

224
00:14:35,184 --> 00:14:36,186
Please, stop!

225
00:14:36,419 --> 00:14:38,103
Just leave everything to me.

226
00:14:39,361 --> 00:14:42,624
The old coin-and-glass trick is one of my specialties.

227
00:14:42,905 --> 00:14:45,941
Surface tension is a surprisingly strong force.

228
00:14:46,318 --> 00:14:49,406
There's room for at least
eight or nine coins in the glass.

229
00:14:50,014 --> 00:14:53,469
I just have to stay calm and
make sure my fingers don't shake.

230
00:14:54,389 --> 00:14:58,043
Is it all right if I drop in
more than one coin at the same time?

231
00:14:58,167 --> 00:15:00,249
As long as they all go in at once.

232
00:15:00,293 --> 00:15:01,016
Well, then...

233
00:15:02,164 --> 00:15:03,886
What? Five coins?!

234
00:15:03,992 --> 00:15:05,732
Hey, that'll create a wave on the surface.

235
00:15:05,781 --> 00:15:06,752
Quiet, please.

236
00:15:09,225 --> 00:15:11,181
Take your hands off the table.

237
00:15:37,352 --> 00:15:38,987
It looks like it's your turn.

238
00:15:39,067 --> 00:15:43,030
It takes nerves of steel to put in five coins at once.

239
00:15:43,423 --> 00:15:46,874
I think I'll go with one coin. It's too close to call.

240
00:15:48,804 --> 00:15:49,221
Hmm?

241
00:15:52,566 --> 00:15:53,886
Typical old man.

242
00:15:54,506 --> 00:15:58,485
He's squeezing a cotton ball between his
finger and the coin to leak liquid into the glass.

243
00:15:59,007 --> 00:16:01,271
So that's how he's gonna make the glass overflow.

244
00:16:02,111 --> 00:16:04,117
And he told me to watch for cheating?

245
00:16:05,083 --> 00:16:07,358
Clever bastard. Not bad.

246
00:16:17,601 --> 00:16:19,375
The glass has reached its limit.

247
00:16:19,435 --> 00:16:21,672
One more coin, and the booze will spill.

248
00:16:21,711 --> 00:16:24,714
Victory is mine. Ha ha! It's like he said.

249
00:16:24,847 --> 00:16:27,872
We'll see which dance partner cries first.

250
00:16:28,352 --> 00:16:30,521
Ooh, man, that was a close one.

251
00:16:30,591 --> 00:16:32,464
I thought it was gonna spill for sure.

252
00:16:32,535 --> 00:16:35,296
Well, it's your turn. Good luck, Obi.

253
00:16:37,499 --> 00:16:40,257
It's D'arby. Don't make me say it again.

254
00:16:40,282 --> 00:16:42,784
I told you my name is D'arby. Understand?

255
00:16:42,850 --> 00:16:44,525
Not Obi, not Barbie!

256
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:47,111
Hmm? Apologies.

257
00:16:48,483 --> 00:16:51,992
He's screwing up his name on purpose to
get him riled up and throw off his game.

258
00:16:52,541 --> 00:16:55,286
I gotta hand it to the old man. He's a natural.

259
00:16:55,977 --> 00:16:57,756
So what do you say we keep playing?

260
00:16:58,094 --> 00:17:01,600
I believe it's your turn to drop a coin in, D'arby.

261
00:17:11,353 --> 00:17:14,007
The shadow makes it difficult to see from here.

262
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:17,253
I'll lower the coin in from the right side of the table.

263
00:17:17,459 --> 00:17:19,710
Drop it in from whatever angle you'd like.

264
00:17:20,168 --> 00:17:24,418
What he doesn't know is the glass is
already at its limit thanks to my little trick.

265
00:17:24,767 --> 00:17:27,477
There's no way the liquid could take another coin.

266
00:17:27,623 --> 00:17:30,187
Even the slightest touch will cause it to spill over.

267
00:17:38,787 --> 00:17:41,648
You're probably thinking the glass has reached its limit,

268
00:17:41,771 --> 00:17:44,703
that dropping in another coin would be impossible.

269
00:17:46,262 --> 00:17:48,333
Well, you'd be wrong about that.

270
00:17:56,846 --> 00:17:59,969
There's no way! How the hell did he do that?!

271
00:18:00,194 --> 00:18:01,736
Why didn't it spill over?!

272
00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:03,466
Your question's confusing.

273
00:18:03,491 --> 00:18:05,372
What do you mean, why didn't it spill?

274
00:18:05,562 --> 00:18:07,834
You saw the result with your own eyes.

275
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,801
As far as I know, he didn't do anything devious.

276
00:18:12,168 --> 00:18:14,068
I was watching him with Star Platinum.

277
00:18:14,729 --> 00:18:17,804
It's hard to believe, but he
dropped it in fair and square.

278
00:18:17,933 --> 00:18:18,946
There's no doubt.

279
00:18:19,728 --> 00:18:21,614
But how did he do it?

280
00:18:22,107 --> 00:18:26,559
I'm positive I added enough liquid to the
glass that one more coin would make it spill.

281
00:18:26,803 --> 00:18:29,906
I don't get it. There's no way it shouldn't have spilled.

282
00:18:30,166 --> 00:18:31,389
What's going on?

283
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:34,471
Make your move. It's your turn, Joestar.

284
00:18:34,703 --> 00:18:36,032
Hurry it up already,

285
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:39,022
or are you trying to wait until it evaporates?

286
00:18:50,466 --> 00:18:53,211
No, no, this can't be happening.

287
00:19:20,181 --> 00:19:21,834
Mr. Joestar!

288
00:19:28,116 --> 00:19:31,975
Deep in his heart of hearts, Joestar
had already come to the realization

289
00:19:32,048 --> 00:19:33,668
that he'd lost this game.

290
00:19:33,802 --> 00:19:36,203
That's why his soul emerged so easily.

291
00:19:36,432 --> 00:19:39,624
I, D'arby, have won this bet like all the others.

292
00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:43,972
Polnareff, I... I failed you.

293
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:48,944
Holly, I'm so sorry, my beautiful
girl, but daddy's let you down.

294
00:19:51,923 --> 00:19:52,931
Mr. Joestar!

295
00:19:52,982 --> 00:19:53,964
Old man, no!

296
00:20:02,444 --> 00:20:03,271
Two down.

297
00:20:03,351 --> 00:20:05,634
Now let's continue where we left off,

298
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:11,975
that is unless you two have decided to abandon your
friends and slink away with your tails between your legs.

299
00:20:12,601 --> 00:20:14,341
You bastard!

300
00:20:16,606 --> 00:20:18,146
You don't get it, do you?

301
00:20:18,299 --> 00:20:20,796
I keep trying to tell you that if you take my life,

302
00:20:20,861 --> 00:20:22,663
your friends will die with me.

303
00:20:22,984 --> 00:20:23,961
Damn you!

304
00:20:23,998 --> 00:20:25,249
Avdol, stand down!

305
00:20:25,295 --> 00:20:28,016
Hey, if you're gonna cause trouble,
then I'm gonna have to ask you to lea...

306
00:20:28,041 --> 00:20:30,287
Shut your mouth, and stay out of this!

307
00:20:30,312 --> 00:20:30,882
Right!

308
00:20:47,403 --> 00:20:50,032
You've noticed it too late, Jotaro.

309
00:20:50,106 --> 00:20:52,850
Eh, what? Something's wrong with the glass?

310
00:20:52,875 --> 00:20:55,772
This is the reason the coin
didn't make the booze spill over.

311
00:20:56,277 --> 00:21:00,418
If you look at the bottom of the glass, you'll
see that there's a tiny bit of chocolate on it.

312
00:21:01,155 --> 00:21:02,886
He must have found a way to stick it on

313
00:21:02,914 --> 00:21:06,231
when he was inspecting the glass and
coins at the very beginning of the game.

314
00:21:07,456 --> 00:21:09,444
Surely you know the rules by now.

315
00:21:09,491 --> 00:21:12,565
It doesn't count as cheating if
you never get caught in the act.

316
00:21:12,748 --> 00:21:14,435
What? I don't understand.

317
00:21:14,459 --> 00:21:17,568
How could a piece of chocolate
allow him to drop in an extra coin?

318
00:21:18,403 --> 00:21:20,069
Well, at this point, it's melted,

319
00:21:20,263 --> 00:21:23,413
but it used to be a solid chunk
stuck to the bottom of the glass,

320
00:21:24,266 --> 00:21:28,632
just enough to slightly tilt the glass, but
not quite enough for us to notice the change.

321
00:21:28,964 --> 00:21:30,776
Once the chocolate started to melt,

322
00:21:30,893 --> 00:21:32,771
the glass came to be level with the table.

323
00:21:33,768 --> 00:21:36,232
With the glass leveled out, the booze began to settle,

324
00:21:36,418 --> 00:21:38,557
which made enough room for another coin.

325
00:21:39,232 --> 00:21:40,872
W-What the hell?!

326
00:21:41,106 --> 00:21:42,825
B-but that doesn't make any sense!

327
00:21:42,858 --> 00:21:45,895
How could he have known the chocolate
would melt right when he needed it to?

328
00:21:47,115 --> 00:21:49,083
He influenced things by using the sun.

329
00:21:49,291 --> 00:21:50,613
It slipped my notice.

330
00:21:51,489 --> 00:21:55,828
When he moved to the right side of the table, he
allowed the sun to shine directly onto the chocolate,

331
00:21:55,905 --> 00:21:57,163
thereby melting it.

332
00:22:07,527 --> 00:22:08,413
All right.

333
00:22:09,018 --> 00:22:12,343
D'arby, get your cards, 'cause we're playin' my game.

334
00:22:12,441 --> 00:22:14,016
Hope you're ready for some poker.

335
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:15,002
Eh?

336
00:22:15,026 --> 00:22:15,904
Say what?!

337
00:22:16,387 --> 00:22:17,171
Jotaro!

338
00:22:18,694 --> 00:22:19,590
Interesting.

339
00:22:19,795 --> 00:22:23,889
You couldn't have possibly known this,
but poker is my absolute favorite game.

340
00:22:24,059 --> 00:22:25,617
Are you out of your mind?!

341
00:22:25,642 --> 00:22:28,545
You're playing poker with a
man who outsmarted Mr. Joestar.

342
00:22:28,604 --> 00:22:29,812
It's too dangerous!

343
00:22:29,945 --> 00:22:30,826
Yeah, I know.

344
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:34,035
Even though he doesn't use physical strength,

345
00:22:34,403 --> 00:22:37,232
he's the most dangerous stand user we've ever faced.

346
00:22:37,971 --> 00:22:38,731
So now...

347
00:22:44,252 --> 00:22:46,744
There's no turning back, and we're playing for keeps.
