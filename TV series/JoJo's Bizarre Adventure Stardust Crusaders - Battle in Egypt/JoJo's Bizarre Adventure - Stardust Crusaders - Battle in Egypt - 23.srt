1
00:00:24,064 --> 00:00:28,833
It seems I was right about The World's
speed and power exceeding that of Star Platinum,

2
00:00:29,163 --> 00:00:33,825
so there's nothing left to do
but bring this game to an end.

3
00:00:34,808 --> 00:00:39,519
It should have been done ages ago, but I'll
finally be rid of you Joestars once and for all.

4
00:00:40,844 --> 00:00:42,456
Using the power of my stand,

5
00:00:42,604 --> 00:00:44,710
I will send you all into oblivion!

6
00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:48,794
Now The World will stop time itself!

7
00:02:34,679 --> 00:02:40,651
Jotaro, your exasperating family line is
just moments away from being eradicated.

8
00:02:41,299 --> 00:02:44,536
My hundred-year struggle with the Joestars ends with you.

9
00:02:45,123 --> 00:02:45,904
Begone!

10
00:02:58,896 --> 00:03:00,268
He moved his finger.

11
00:03:00,665 --> 00:03:02,693
But how? What's going on?

12
00:03:03,117 --> 00:03:05,619
He shouldn't be able to think, let alone move.

13
00:03:07,512 --> 00:03:09,442
Wait. There's no way.

14
00:03:10,448 --> 00:03:11,715
Is his power...

15
00:03:14,245 --> 00:03:16,733
The same as The World's?

16
00:03:19,508 --> 00:03:22,767
Your stand has a lot in common with my Star Platinum.

17
00:03:23,396 --> 00:03:27,566
Did he mean The World and Star
Platinum are the same type of stand?

18
00:03:32,871 --> 00:03:33,537
Damn it.

19
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:36,425
Can you see me right now?

20
00:03:36,567 --> 00:03:40,171
Are you consciously moving,
or is it an involuntary twitch?

21
00:03:41,779 --> 00:03:43,294
Okay, time's up.

22
00:03:44,741 --> 00:03:46,025
Ora! Ora! Ora!

23
00:03:51,462 --> 00:03:53,598
Jotaro, could you see me?

24
00:03:56,968 --> 00:04:00,165
Must I repeat? I asked if you could follow my movements!

25
00:04:00,797 --> 00:04:03,239
See what? You're not making sense.

26
00:04:03,287 --> 00:04:05,035
Need to have your eyes checked, Dio?

27
00:04:14,065 --> 00:04:16,600
Just you wait. You can't run forever.

28
00:04:16,627 --> 00:04:20,230
Seeing me isn't going to do you
any good when time is standing still!

29
00:04:22,225 --> 00:04:25,178
If your stand does bear similarities to mine, prove it!

30
00:04:25,738 --> 00:04:28,546
I want to see just how much we have in common!

31
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:34,518
Yes, it's been six months since I
began to grasp the art of stopping time.

32
00:04:39,018 --> 00:04:41,486
To test The World's speed and power,

33
00:04:41,606 --> 00:04:46,216
I commanded my servant to take
aim point-blank right at my back.

34
00:04:46,743 --> 00:04:48,075
And for a moment,

35
00:04:48,126 --> 00:04:51,124
it looked as though time itself had stood still.

36
00:04:51,684 --> 00:04:54,063
I thought for sure I was hallucinating.

37
00:04:54,316 --> 00:04:58,821
It seemed like the vision a boxer has
when his opponent's punches linger in midair.

38
00:04:59,441 --> 00:05:01,845
That second felt like an eternity.

39
00:05:02,533 --> 00:05:04,848
But I wasn't simply imagining things.

40
00:05:05,075 --> 00:05:10,123
My stand was actually able to move between the
hovering bullets that were suspended in time...

41
00:05:13,139 --> 00:05:14,865
And it could grasp them.

42
00:05:18,964 --> 00:05:20,178
Yes, lord Dio.

43
00:05:20,211 --> 00:05:22,908
You are well on your way to being the master of time.

44
00:05:23,101 --> 00:05:27,240
The next step is willing yourself to
move through the realm of frozen time.

45
00:05:27,808 --> 00:05:30,121
It must happen as naturally as breathing

46
00:05:30,146 --> 00:05:34,375
or as nonchalantly as snapping a
pencil betwixt your mighty fingers.

47
00:05:34,492 --> 00:05:37,035
You must think of it as completely ordinary.

48
00:05:37,234 --> 00:05:40,202
The most important thing is having faith in yourself.

49
00:05:40,264 --> 00:05:44,255
It's imperative that you find the
mental fortitude to steel your mind.

50
00:05:45,984 --> 00:05:48,635
You are the one, true ruler of this world!

51
00:05:48,666 --> 00:05:51,797
Controlling time should be second nature to you!

52
00:05:54,773 --> 00:06:00,297
Then one day, I sensed the wheels of
time and The World interlock at long last.

53
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:04,086
Like a ray of clarity dispersing the shadows in my mind,

54
00:06:04,141 --> 00:06:06,017
a revelation befell me.

55
00:06:06,288 --> 00:06:12,300
I was Dio, and my destiny was to surpass
all living things, including stand users!

56
00:06:12,353 --> 00:06:17,103
I can stop time for five seconds, and
the time limit keeps extending by the day!

57
00:06:17,349 --> 00:06:21,221
Now, Jotaro, you're about to
experience just how weak you are!

58
00:06:21,561 --> 00:06:23,640
Time to make good on my promise!

59
00:06:24,515 --> 00:06:27,993
The world! Grind to a halt!

60
00:06:32,985 --> 00:06:33,573
Hmm?

61
00:06:58,439 --> 00:07:00,252
I see you planted a magnet.

62
00:07:01,383 --> 00:07:03,735
Must have been when we were exchanging blows.

63
00:07:03,915 --> 00:07:07,513
It looks like a wallet magnet or
one picked from a pocket planner.

64
00:07:09,545 --> 00:07:11,915
I have to admit you had me fooled.

65
00:07:11,943 --> 00:07:14,130
You're a clever boy indeed,

66
00:07:14,505 --> 00:07:15,212
but...

67
00:07:16,472 --> 00:07:22,040
If you have to resort to inane tricks like that, it only
proves that you can't move while time is standing still!

68
00:07:22,513 --> 00:07:25,479
You've only postponed the inevitable by a few seconds!

69
00:07:25,545 --> 00:07:26,619
This is the end!

70
00:07:26,998 --> 00:07:28,487
Die, Jotaro!

71
00:07:39,748 --> 00:07:40,383
What?!

72
00:07:43,353 --> 00:07:44,656
How the...

73
00:07:45,242 --> 00:07:47,717
He's moving. What nerve.

74
00:07:47,785 --> 00:07:50,056
Although, he can only do it briefly.

75
00:07:50,649 --> 00:07:52,890
The magnet wasn't meant to make me think he could move.

76
00:07:53,703 --> 00:07:55,570
It was made to make me think he couldn't.

77
00:07:55,722 --> 00:07:58,484
Damn it. It was a trap designed to lure me in,

78
00:07:58,823 --> 00:08:00,117
and I fell for it!

79
00:08:00,176 --> 00:08:03,916
The key is believing that your
power is completely ordinary.

80
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:07,879
Disgusting! To think that my domain could be invaded,

81
00:08:08,139 --> 00:08:12,278
and by the one of the Joestars, no less! It's infuriating!

82
00:08:24,201 --> 00:08:26,503
I was able to move for a second there.

83
00:08:26,538 --> 00:08:27,749
That's a good sign.

84
00:08:28,085 --> 00:08:31,184
Even so, that's not much.

85
00:08:31,503 --> 00:08:34,156
It would only give me enough time for a single punch.

86
00:08:44,017 --> 00:08:45,581
You there, woman...

87
00:08:46,839 --> 00:08:50,173
How about you make yourself useful and fetch me my leg?

88
00:08:52,004 --> 00:08:53,519
Bring it here this instant!

89
00:08:53,544 --> 00:08:58,703
Imagine you're a flight attendant bringing caviar to
a passenger in first class if it gets you here faster!

90
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:07,972
Well, that's good to know.

91
00:09:08,459 --> 00:09:11,854
Seems I'll have to blow your head
off to do any significant damage.

92
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:17,101
Bastard, you've already siphoned
off enough energy to heal yourself.

93
00:09:18,615 --> 00:09:22,203
It's like that gaping hole I opened
in your gut was never even there.

94
00:09:26,587 --> 00:09:29,692
Your eyes followed me even while time was frozen,

95
00:09:30,039 --> 00:09:34,232
which confirms that you can see my
movements. Isn't that right, Jotaro?

96
00:09:36,507 --> 00:09:38,197
Nervous yet, sweetheart?

97
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:41,334
Not at all. Kakyoin did you quite the favor.

98
00:09:41,587 --> 00:09:45,850
Because of his brilliant mind, he was
able to correctly deduce The World's secret,

99
00:09:45,909 --> 00:09:50,020
and because he passed that knowledge along,
you figured out that I could stop time at will

100
00:09:50,114 --> 00:09:52,646
and worked until you learned how to do it yourself.

101
00:09:53,325 --> 00:09:53,815
Hmm?

102
00:09:54,232 --> 00:09:57,165
Then again, you haven't had as much training as I have,

103
00:09:57,195 --> 00:10:01,347
so I'm curious to know exactly how
long you can move while time is frozen.

104
00:10:01,929 --> 00:10:03,960
Two seconds? Or maybe three?

105
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,698
Or perhaps you can move five seconds like me,

106
00:10:06,741 --> 00:10:11,118
but you're pretending you can't to
gain some kind of an advantage. Clever.

107
00:10:13,922 --> 00:10:15,028
Which is it?

108
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:17,027
This isn't good.

109
00:10:17,721 --> 00:10:21,004
I could probably move longer if I
was able to get some practice in,

110
00:10:21,615 --> 00:10:24,861
but as it stands, the best I can do is a second.

111
00:10:25,656 --> 00:10:27,844
If I was forced to make a guess,

112
00:10:28,295 --> 00:10:30,701
I'd say you could only move for a second.

113
00:10:30,986 --> 00:10:35,406
Be that as it may, you've still
managed to infiltrate my world.

114
00:10:35,457 --> 00:10:37,810
Only a fool would risk approaching you now.

115
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:41,622
And though I'm many things, a fool
wouldn't be considered one of them.

116
00:10:41,822 --> 00:10:45,621
While it's achingly clear that my
advantage over you is overwhelming...

117
00:10:46,686 --> 00:10:49,082
I've still devised a way to execute you,

118
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:53,688
so regardless of how long you can move in
my world, you'll never escape your demise!

119
00:10:54,732 --> 00:10:56,147
You're white as a sheet.

120
00:10:56,181 --> 00:10:57,922
Do these bring back memories?

121
00:10:57,962 --> 00:11:02,794
Do they remind you that you're going to die a
death even more horrific than your pathetic grandfather?

122
00:11:03,219 --> 00:11:04,847
Screw this bastard.

123
00:11:04,916 --> 00:11:07,015
How the hell does he come up with this kind of shit?

124
00:11:07,191 --> 00:11:08,439
I need to be careful.

125
00:11:11,836 --> 00:11:13,235
There is no escape.

126
00:11:14,172 --> 00:11:15,382
The world!

127
00:11:22,683 --> 00:11:24,079
Five seconds left.

128
00:11:28,984 --> 00:11:33,620
Do you think your Star Platinum can
deflect all of the knives once time resumes?

129
00:11:33,667 --> 00:11:38,326
If I were a betting man, I'd give that
plan a one-in-a-million chance of working.

130
00:11:38,859 --> 00:11:39,974
Four seconds!

131
00:11:42,869 --> 00:11:46,937
It must be terrifying to stare death
in the face and be helpless to stop it.

132
00:11:47,211 --> 00:11:49,164
Only three seconds remain.

133
00:11:50,246 --> 00:11:51,386
Ora!

134
00:11:57,433 --> 00:11:59,268
You're down to two seconds.

135
00:11:59,356 --> 00:12:01,708
Are you telling me that's the best you've got?

136
00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:07,552
That's just more evidence of your ineptitude
in the presence of one such as myself.

137
00:12:08,426 --> 00:12:10,212
One second left to go.

138
00:12:12,103 --> 00:12:13,398
Zero.

139
00:12:26,933 --> 00:12:28,273
It's over.

140
00:12:28,527 --> 00:12:30,661
But one can never be too careful.

141
00:12:36,452 --> 00:12:42,258
Now, to be perfectly honest, I'm relieved I
was able to do away with you so quickly, Jotaro.

142
00:12:43,693 --> 00:12:48,912
I have to say, I never would have thought that
you'd have the power to infiltrate my perfect world.

143
00:12:50,295 --> 00:12:51,461
Now let's see.

144
00:12:51,774 --> 00:12:57,575
A fitting analogy would be the automobile, useful
machines until the roads become clogged with them all.

145
00:13:00,523 --> 00:13:03,041
Sorry, but the mantle of master of time

146
00:13:03,364 --> 00:13:05,115
is reserved for me alone.

147
00:13:19,383 --> 00:13:20,965
Oh, good grief.

148
00:13:21,829 --> 00:13:23,594
He throw enough knives, or what?

149
00:13:24,130 --> 00:13:27,181
I mean, he turned my favorite uniform into Swiss cheese.

150
00:13:29,635 --> 00:13:32,766
Well, I'm glad I decided to
stuff my clothes with magazines.

151
00:13:33,559 --> 00:13:37,127
I figured it was only a matter of
time before he tried throwing weapons,

152
00:13:37,644 --> 00:13:39,559
but I didn't expect that many.

153
00:13:40,408 --> 00:13:43,060
My best bet right now is to play possum

154
00:13:43,449 --> 00:13:46,161
and wait for a chance to take Dio by surprise.

155
00:13:46,837 --> 00:13:48,385
Since he can regenerate,

156
00:13:48,618 --> 00:13:51,656
I've gotta bash his brains in, or else he'll never die.

157
00:13:52,218 --> 00:13:52,709
Eh?

158
00:13:59,591 --> 00:14:02,308
I believe I'll do one more check for good measure.

159
00:14:02,507 --> 00:14:05,380
The Joestars have a way of coming back from the dead,

160
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:08,777
and there's a chance Jotaro is putting on this death act.

161
00:14:10,695 --> 00:14:14,078
I need to make sure he's gone for good.

162
00:14:16,673 --> 00:14:18,106
I'll use this...

163
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:22,087
to sever that troublesome head of his!

164
00:14:28,696 --> 00:14:30,631
It's time for you to die...

165
00:14:32,195 --> 00:14:33,614
Jotaro!

166
00:14:44,768 --> 00:14:49,089
The only one dying here is you!

167
00:14:55,142 --> 00:14:56,695
You are the one who's gonna die!

168
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:57,412
Polnareff!

169
00:15:04,705 --> 00:15:06,324
Time has stopped.

170
00:15:06,527 --> 00:15:08,553
Let's get a good look at your face.

171
00:15:11,977 --> 00:15:14,396
I see. It's Polnareff.

172
00:15:16,452 --> 00:15:18,305
And now time will resume.

173
00:15:22,957 --> 00:15:24,505
What a shame, Polnareff.

174
00:15:24,546 --> 00:15:27,080
You were so close, but dropped the ball.

175
00:15:27,327 --> 00:15:30,168
If you'd lunged with more force behind your attack,

176
00:15:30,211 --> 00:15:34,005
you could have eviscerated my brain
beyond the point of regeneration.

177
00:15:35,458 --> 00:15:36,851
You bastard.

178
00:15:37,244 --> 00:15:38,830
It's not over yet.

179
00:15:40,145 --> 00:15:42,882
When will you all accept that you cannot kill me?

180
00:15:43,170 --> 00:15:46,719
You are nothing more than pawns
destined to be put in check.

181
00:15:47,079 --> 00:15:51,707
Your death brings about the end of
the Joestars's tragic Egyptian journey.

182
00:15:51,806 --> 00:15:52,546
Damn it.

183
00:15:52,897 --> 00:15:55,539
If I don't do something, Polnareff's as good as dead.

184
00:15:57,752 --> 00:16:01,928
I was gonna keep up this act until I had a
chance to catch him off guard and crush his skull,

185
00:16:02,944 --> 00:16:06,760
but saving Polnareff from this undead
freak is more important right now.

186
00:16:07,173 --> 00:16:08,780
It's not gonna be easy, though.

187
00:16:09,317 --> 00:16:12,390
He won't make the mistake of
crossing into Star Platinum's range,

188
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:15,333
so it'll just end up like the last time he trapped me.

189
00:16:16,035 --> 00:16:18,575
Whatever I do, I can't let him know I'm alive.

190
00:16:19,048 --> 00:16:22,364
As long as he thinks I'm dead,
I have the element of surprise,

191
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:24,679
which gives me a chance to get in close.

192
00:16:25,065 --> 00:16:27,334
Strange how things end up coming full circle.

193
00:16:28,027 --> 00:16:31,607
One minute, I'm trying to will myself
to move through a world of frozen time,

194
00:16:31,975 --> 00:16:35,090
and the next, I'm doing everything
I can to stay completely still.

195
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:38,566
Enjoy your journey to the afterlife!

196
00:16:43,789 --> 00:16:45,517
Damn you, Jotaro.

197
00:16:49,132 --> 00:16:50,798
Was he alive all along?

198
00:16:51,025 --> 00:16:53,587
At the very least, he seems to be coming to.

199
00:16:56,077 --> 00:16:58,513
Hold it! This is the police!

200
00:16:58,598 --> 00:17:00,882
You try anything funny, and we will shoot!

201
00:17:01,073 --> 00:17:03,135
Slowly put your hands in the air!

202
00:17:08,426 --> 00:17:10,888
Ah, what impeccable timing.

203
00:17:11,328 --> 00:17:12,414
If you wouldn't mind,

204
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:14,544
there's somebody I'd like for you to shoot.

205
00:17:14,645 --> 00:17:16,937
Do you see that man lying on the ground?

206
00:17:17,290 --> 00:17:19,419
Shoot his leg or torso.

207
00:17:21,636 --> 00:17:24,888
That's right. Line up the shot, and let the bullet fly.

208
00:17:28,376 --> 00:17:29,578
Hmm.

209
00:17:32,921 --> 00:17:38,371
I thought I heard Jotaro make a sound a moment
ago, but I guess my mind was playing tricks on me.

210
00:17:44,393 --> 00:17:46,291
Could he be any more demented?

211
00:17:46,930 --> 00:17:49,121
He's at least lost interest in Polnareff,

212
00:17:49,509 --> 00:17:51,463
but now that his attention's back on me,

213
00:17:51,864 --> 00:17:53,304
he's even more suspicious.

214
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:56,170
He's not gonna rest until he's sure I'm dead.

215
00:17:56,710 --> 00:17:58,209
Things just got a lot harder.

216
00:17:58,776 --> 00:18:01,293
I know. Why don't we check his breathing?

217
00:18:05,305 --> 00:18:08,151
No luck. He's not breathing.

218
00:18:08,737 --> 00:18:11,819
But there's no way to hide his heartbeat.

219
00:18:26,783 --> 00:18:28,283
Shit, this hurts.

220
00:18:28,615 --> 00:18:32,150
If I black out, everything we've
been through will have been for nothing.

221
00:18:32,617 --> 00:18:35,656
Dying because I used my own stand to stop my heart,

222
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:39,101
it'd be ironic in a morbid kind of way.

223
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:46,250
And sure enough, there's no heartbeat.

224
00:18:46,483 --> 00:18:51,484
What do you know? I suppose the thought of him
being alive was just a figment of my imagination.

225
00:18:53,051 --> 00:18:58,003
Though, stranger things have happened, so I
should still probably lop off his head to be sure.

226
00:18:58,896 --> 00:19:00,558
That's not a problem, is it?

227
00:19:13,396 --> 00:19:14,116
What?!

228
00:19:19,818 --> 00:19:20,631
Ora!

229
00:19:20,694 --> 00:19:23,865
I have to stop time again! The world!

230
00:19:25,966 --> 00:19:27,348
I gotta hand it to you.

231
00:19:27,448 --> 00:19:29,556
You really put me through hell back there.

232
00:19:29,843 --> 00:19:33,153
You're not stopping time or leaving
with your skull intact, got it?!

233
00:19:35,026 --> 00:19:38,113
No! This can't be happening to me!

234
00:19:38,154 --> 00:19:39,880
Ora!

235
00:19:44,689 --> 00:19:45,934
Took long enough.

236
00:19:46,489 --> 00:19:49,897
I finally got to run my fist
straight through his demented skull.

237
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:55,133
But that walking cesspool of evil lived
at the bottom of the sea for over a century.

238
00:19:55,897 --> 00:19:58,003
I can't be sure that attack killed him.

239
00:19:58,490 --> 00:20:00,992
It's a bit too early to take a victory lap.

240
00:20:06,581 --> 00:20:09,090
I will annihilate you.

241
00:20:11,490 --> 00:20:14,359
What the hell? I can't move.

242
00:20:14,465 --> 00:20:17,187
Jotaro, what did you do to me?

243
00:20:17,387 --> 00:20:19,500
I don't have control over my legs.

244
00:20:19,662 --> 00:20:21,198
I can't even stand.

245
00:20:23,392 --> 00:20:24,680
Agh! My head!

246
00:20:24,846 --> 00:20:26,533
The pain is unbearable.

247
00:20:27,441 --> 00:20:29,009
I think I'm going to vomit.

248
00:20:29,113 --> 00:20:30,956
This can't be happening to me.

249
00:20:31,302 --> 00:20:33,293
I'm the pinnacle of perfection!

250
00:20:34,021 --> 00:20:37,732
He actually damaged my brain and paralyzed my legs!

251
00:20:38,072 --> 00:20:39,780
Shit, shit, shit.

252
00:20:39,993 --> 00:20:42,028
I've gotta find a way out of here.

253
00:20:46,112 --> 00:20:48,930
I've doused you with gasoline so you can't hide.

254
00:20:49,230 --> 00:20:52,576
Normally, I would hate to kick
a guy when he's down on his luck,

255
00:20:52,804 --> 00:20:55,131
but with you, I don't give a damn.

256
00:20:55,465 --> 00:20:58,546
You killed my friends and countless innocent bystanders,

257
00:20:58,723 --> 00:21:00,506
so don't expect any mercy.

258
00:21:11,576 --> 00:21:14,868
Come forth, The World!

259
00:21:19,771 --> 00:21:20,772
If I can...

260
00:21:21,729 --> 00:21:24,879
Just make it a little farther.

261
00:21:30,061 --> 00:21:32,963
And now time will flow as usual.

262
00:21:37,655 --> 00:21:39,436
While he had his ear to the ground,

263
00:21:39,537 --> 00:21:42,011
he was also listening for any nearby cars.

264
00:21:42,098 --> 00:21:43,168
Clever, but...

265
00:21:43,584 --> 00:21:45,809
bastard's not getting away that easily!

266
00:21:54,181 --> 00:21:56,905
A-almost.

267
00:21:59,037 --> 00:22:00,098
Keep going.

268
00:22:01,031 --> 00:22:01,785
That's it.

269
00:22:02,307 --> 00:22:04,180
I'm almost there.

270
00:22:05,992 --> 00:22:07,774
And where do you think you're going?

271
00:22:07,946 --> 00:22:09,787
We've got unfinished business.

272
00:22:12,992 --> 00:22:15,529
It's over, Dio. Time to accept it.

273
00:22:27,121 --> 00:22:28,614
The world! Freez...

274
00:22:28,645 --> 00:22:36,873
Ora! Ora! Ora! Ora! Ora! Ora...

275
00:22:36,994 --> 00:22:37,781
Ora!

276
00:22:44,433 --> 00:22:46,244
You fell for it, Jotaro!

277
00:22:46,371 --> 00:22:48,939
Now my victory is all but assured!

278
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:52,547
Once again, my genius has triumphed over you!

279
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:55,195
Doesn't this street look familiar?

280
00:23:01,187 --> 00:23:02,204
This street.

281
00:23:03,649 --> 00:23:04,566
What have I done?

282
00:23:09,191 --> 00:23:10,611
You've failed.

283
00:23:10,737 --> 00:23:15,916
This was my escape route to your
grandfather, and now his blood is mine.

284
00:23:20,503 --> 00:23:21,525
Dio!

285
00:23:22,365 --> 00:23:23,453
You're dead!
