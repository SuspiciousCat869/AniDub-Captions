1
00:00:01,682 --> 00:00:04,368
Previously on "JoJo's Bizarre Adventure"...

2
00:00:07,483 --> 00:00:08,489
What the hell?!

3
00:00:08,831 --> 00:00:10,216
Hell, yeah!

4
00:00:12,615 --> 00:00:14,746
"'Now, Hol Horse, ' Mondatta instructed,"

5
00:00:14,797 --> 00:00:18,809
"'stick your fingers all the way up
Polnareff's nose, and then we'll win!'"

6
00:00:19,651 --> 00:00:21,626
"'They're out cold from losing all that blood.

7
00:00:21,791 --> 00:00:23,112
"'lucky you, Hol Horse!

8
00:00:23,137 --> 00:00:25,627
This is your chance to finish them off for good!'"

9
00:00:25,887 --> 00:00:28,762
So when is this so-called chance supposed to get here,

10
00:00:28,929 --> 00:00:30,492
and what do I do 'til then?

11
00:00:31,714 --> 00:00:34,035
Excuse me, Hol Horse.

12
00:00:34,234 --> 00:00:35,431
What the hell are you doing?

13
00:00:35,456 --> 00:00:38,061
You're not the only one who
wants the answer to that question.

14
00:00:38,086 --> 00:00:39,461
What's the matter, Polnareff?

15
00:00:40,269 --> 00:00:41,667
Shit! What now?!

16
00:00:41,764 --> 00:00:43,462
They're on me like white on rice!

17
00:00:43,487 --> 00:00:44,076
Damn it!

18
00:00:44,167 --> 00:00:47,454
How the hell do I make the rest
of this stupid prediction come true?

19
00:00:48,205 --> 00:00:51,542
Hey, Polnareff, did you find the person tailing us?

20
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:52,654
Say something.

21
00:00:53,087 --> 00:00:56,260
Avdol and the others, they'll be here soon.

22
00:01:02,071 --> 00:01:04,618
Damn it. How am I gonna get out of this one?

23
00:01:06,075 --> 00:01:07,285
Chario...

24
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:08,712
Hold it right there.

25
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:11,674
This is bad.

26
00:01:11,954 --> 00:01:15,010
I-I'm the... the fastest quick draw around.

27
00:01:15,088 --> 00:01:17,034
Now don't move, or you're dead.

28
00:01:17,059 --> 00:01:19,135
Hey, did you say something?

29
00:01:19,501 --> 00:01:20,322
Polnareff?

30
00:01:25,608 --> 00:01:26,406
Polnareff!

31
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:37,925
Huh?

32
00:01:37,949 --> 00:01:38,410
Hmm?

33
00:01:42,631 --> 00:01:43,446
Hang on.

34
00:01:43,546 --> 00:01:45,599
You've been here the entire time?

35
00:01:45,928 --> 00:01:46,680
What's wrong?

36
00:01:46,771 --> 00:01:48,898
Did you find someone
following us or not?

37
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:50,500
Well, uh...

38
00:01:52,082 --> 00:01:54,030
This is getting uglier by the second.

39
00:01:54,237 --> 00:01:55,685
They've backed me into a corner.

40
00:01:55,919 --> 00:01:57,853
According to that fool comic book,

41
00:01:57,878 --> 00:02:02,121
I was supposed to get my big chance
after I stuck my fingers up Polnareff's nose,

42
00:02:02,712 --> 00:02:04,702
but everything has gone south,

43
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:07,446
and I'm about to be in a whole world of trouble!

44
00:03:39,897 --> 00:03:41,936
Is everything all right, Polnareff?

45
00:03:42,386 --> 00:03:43,679
Uh, of course.

46
00:03:44,072 --> 00:03:46,338
Well, now I've really stepped in it.

47
00:03:46,427 --> 00:03:49,196
If Avdol finds me, I'm as good as dead.

48
00:03:49,534 --> 00:03:51,592
I think I'm gonna cry.

49
00:03:52,012 --> 00:03:54,106
Had I known something like this was gonna happen,

50
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:56,227
I would have just blown him away from a distance.

51
00:03:57,247 --> 00:03:58,288
Mondatta!

52
00:03:58,422 --> 00:04:00,282
This is all your fault. You know that?

53
00:04:00,538 --> 00:04:04,100
That fool Polnareff's sword
would have had nothing on my gun.

54
00:04:04,313 --> 00:04:04,947
Damn it!

55
00:04:05,988 --> 00:04:06,717
Polnareff?

56
00:04:06,741 --> 00:04:07,137
Hmm?

57
00:04:09,398 --> 00:04:11,040
You waiting for an invitation?

58
00:04:11,133 --> 00:04:12,260
Tell 'em to scram,

59
00:04:12,466 --> 00:04:14,195
because I swear to you, Polnareff,

60
00:04:14,248 --> 00:04:17,052
if I'm found out, I'm taking you down with me.

61
00:04:18,278 --> 00:04:21,102
I-I was wrong. No one was tailing us.

62
00:04:21,372 --> 00:04:23,337
Guess it was just my imagination.

63
00:04:23,502 --> 00:04:25,561
Hmm...

64
00:04:25,878 --> 00:04:26,724
I see.

65
00:04:27,144 --> 00:04:31,217
And is there any particular reason you're
nonchalantly standing in the corner like that?

66
00:04:35,494 --> 00:04:37,943
Tell 'em that you wanted to find a place to take a leak.

67
00:04:38,163 --> 00:04:40,139
Do it, or I'll put a bullet in your head.

68
00:04:41,129 --> 00:04:46,040
Oh, I had to take a whiz and couldn't
find a toilet, so what can you do?

69
00:04:46,385 --> 00:04:47,552
Are you serious?

70
00:04:47,577 --> 00:04:49,862
Come on. You were peeing in the street?

71
00:04:50,177 --> 00:04:53,575
Even after all this time, your lack of shame amazes me.

72
00:04:55,354 --> 00:04:56,300
For the love of...

73
00:04:56,413 --> 00:04:58,687
Stop jabbing that stupid gun into my head!

74
00:04:59,306 --> 00:05:01,559
Wait! I may have found a way out of this.

75
00:05:01,699 --> 00:05:04,522
I'll give them a signal and
hope to god they figure it out.

76
00:05:13,076 --> 00:05:13,524
Hmm?

77
00:05:13,548 --> 00:05:14,015
Huh?

78
00:05:14,162 --> 00:05:14,702
Hmm.

79
00:05:15,952 --> 00:05:17,952
Look while my tongue is pointing?

80
00:05:18,014 --> 00:05:19,297
Seriously, people?

81
00:05:19,321 --> 00:05:21,017
I'm trying to give you a sign!

82
00:05:21,175 --> 00:05:22,808
Look behind me!

83
00:05:23,067 --> 00:05:23,775
Hmm?

84
00:05:24,299 --> 00:05:26,025
Behind me, damn it!

85
00:05:26,142 --> 00:05:28,698
Look behind me!

86
00:05:31,103 --> 00:05:31,615
Hmm?

87
00:05:31,978 --> 00:05:32,674
Shit.

88
00:05:32,774 --> 00:05:33,932
Why'd they stop talking?

89
00:05:34,378 --> 00:05:39,135
Well, as you can see, there's nothing
strange going on here, so you can go on ahead.

90
00:05:39,354 --> 00:05:41,019
Hmm? All right.

91
00:05:41,292 --> 00:05:42,748
I was lying.

92
00:05:43,016 --> 00:05:44,389
How are you not catching on?

93
00:05:44,414 --> 00:05:46,568
My tongue. Look at my tongue.

94
00:05:46,616 --> 00:05:47,901
He's right behind me.

95
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:49,434
Please don't leave.

96
00:05:50,411 --> 00:05:51,924
Are you sure you're okay?

97
00:05:51,949 --> 00:05:53,399
You're making a creepy face.

98
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:55,134
Something wrong with your tongue?

99
00:05:55,941 --> 00:05:57,814
No. That's not it.

100
00:05:57,839 --> 00:06:00,089
He's trying to tell us that there's something behind...

101
00:06:00,997 --> 00:06:02,443
Shut your mouth.

102
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:04,116
You mean...

103
00:06:04,643 --> 00:06:05,847
Damn it, Polnareff,

104
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:08,142
you lowdown, dirty, son of a...

105
00:06:09,126 --> 00:06:10,367
You were cluing 'em in.

106
00:06:10,782 --> 00:06:13,218
You've pissed me off for the last time.

107
00:06:13,371 --> 00:06:16,413
I've had just about enough of you. Now die.

108
00:06:18,303 --> 00:06:18,956
What the...

109
00:06:23,939 --> 00:06:24,463
Huh?

110
00:06:25,376 --> 00:06:26,792
What's he doing here?

111
00:06:26,942 --> 00:06:28,071
W-Why?

112
00:06:28,535 --> 00:06:31,070
You idiot, you had to sneeze?

113
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,547
Everyone, watch out!

114
00:06:40,586 --> 00:06:44,666
Hol horse is back, and he's got a friend
hiding under the crate. So be careful!

115
00:06:44,986 --> 00:06:45,878
Blast it!

116
00:06:46,166 --> 00:06:47,790
This can't be happening.

117
00:06:48,018 --> 00:06:51,325
He sneezed, because I went and
jammed my fingers up his nose.

118
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:52,808
Damn, damn!

119
00:06:52,926 --> 00:06:54,452
If Polnareff hadn't sneezed,

120
00:06:54,499 --> 00:06:57,414
at the very least, I could
have gotten rid of him for good.

121
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:01,218
I should have known better than to
team up with the likes of you, Mondatta.

122
00:07:01,249 --> 00:07:02,623
Now they're gonna kill me.

123
00:07:04,045 --> 00:07:07,113
This is all happening because of that blasted premonition.

124
00:07:08,886 --> 00:07:10,910
Now I'm doomed!

125
00:07:12,416 --> 00:07:14,222
Hey, bro, you seeing what I'm seeing?

126
00:07:14,353 --> 00:07:16,708
It looks like that jackass that picked a fight with us.

127
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:20,205
That's him, all right.

128
00:07:20,818 --> 00:07:24,706
I'll never forget the face of
the bastard that blew my ear off!

129
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:27,434
I'll run him over like a piece of roadkill!

130
00:07:37,035 --> 00:07:37,566
What?!

131
00:07:41,403 --> 00:07:41,910
Huh?

132
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:47,963
S-seriously?

133
00:07:48,209 --> 00:07:49,747
It all happened so fast,

134
00:07:49,786 --> 00:07:53,412
they didn't have a chance to whip out their
stands and stop the truck from running 'em down.

135
00:07:53,652 --> 00:07:57,074
My fingers went up his nose, and the prediction came true.

136
00:07:57,816 --> 00:07:59,297
I can't believe this!

137
00:07:59,367 --> 00:08:01,228
I got all four of 'em at once!

138
00:08:01,587 --> 00:08:02,493
It's fate.

139
00:08:02,928 --> 00:08:05,078
My premonitions are always right.

140
00:08:05,486 --> 00:08:08,536
However, it's too soon for you to finish them off.

141
00:08:08,702 --> 00:08:11,978
We must wait for the next prediction to be revealed, yes.

142
00:08:12,489 --> 00:08:13,502
Okay!

143
00:08:22,249 --> 00:08:24,158
"'We did it!' They proclaimed.

144
00:08:24,183 --> 00:08:26,734
"The chance to finish off their enemies had arrived.

145
00:08:26,826 --> 00:08:28,275
"But be careful, you two.

146
00:08:28,395 --> 00:08:30,721
Don't rush in. Hide and wait."

147
00:08:35,301 --> 00:08:37,396
"'It's still too soon for us to move in.

148
00:08:37,912 --> 00:08:40,859
"'Three of 'em are knocked out, but Jotaro's still awake.

149
00:08:41,185 --> 00:08:43,160
He's gonna get up any second now.'"

150
00:08:54,903 --> 00:08:58,333
Jotaro wasn't hit head-on by the
truck like Joseph and the others were.

151
00:08:58,666 --> 00:08:59,779
That was close.

152
00:08:59,826 --> 00:09:02,794
If we'd tried creeping up to him,
there's a chance he could have laid us out.

153
00:09:03,323 --> 00:09:05,418
Great. He's lookin' for me,

154
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:10,708
probably wondering why I split instead of blowin' his
head clear off when I thought he was down for the count.

155
00:09:12,067 --> 00:09:14,726
We are gonna be able to beat these yahoos, right?

156
00:09:15,032 --> 00:09:17,007
We've made it this far, after all.

157
00:09:17,039 --> 00:09:19,653
I have to win, no matter what it takes. You got that?

158
00:09:20,058 --> 00:09:21,411
Are you with me, Mondatta?

159
00:09:21,856 --> 00:09:22,567
Yeah.

160
00:09:23,369 --> 00:09:25,201
We're so close, I can taste it!

161
00:09:25,847 --> 00:09:29,053
Mondatta, it's time to take
these guys out once and for all,

162
00:09:29,078 --> 00:09:30,397
so what's our next move?

163
00:09:30,504 --> 00:09:33,896
You've proven that your comic's
predictions are 100% accurate.

164
00:09:34,156 --> 00:09:37,907
I was wrong, but I believe in you
now, and I'll do whatever I must.

165
00:09:37,932 --> 00:09:40,316
Need me to stick my fingers up something, I will.

166
00:09:40,362 --> 00:09:42,973
Need me to eat crap, I'll do it without a second thought.

167
00:09:43,092 --> 00:09:45,670
I have to win this fight, no matter what.

168
00:09:46,791 --> 00:09:47,272
Oh!

169
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,229
Th-th-th-th-th-there it is!

170
00:09:49,256 --> 00:09:49,995
It's here!

171
00:09:50,202 --> 00:09:52,577
I-it finally appeared, yes!

172
00:09:52,923 --> 00:09:54,852
It's the final prediction!

173
00:09:54,941 --> 00:09:55,540
What?

174
00:09:56,003 --> 00:09:57,256
"The time has arrived."

175
00:09:57,356 --> 00:09:59,913
"Hol horse's next attack will be his last."

176
00:10:00,487 --> 00:10:04,765
"While waiting to strike, Hol Horse came
across two plumbers repairing drainpipes."

177
00:10:04,818 --> 00:10:09,137
"He saw the perfect opportunity to win
and paid them to open one of the pipes."

178
00:10:09,305 --> 00:10:15,020
"If Hol Horse were to fire every last one of his bullets
into that pipe exactly as the clock struck 12:00 noon..."

179
00:10:16,545 --> 00:10:17,931
Hey, check that out.

180
00:10:18,544 --> 00:10:20,651
Looks like there was a car accident around the corner.

181
00:10:20,884 --> 00:10:22,193
Who cares about that?

182
00:10:22,321 --> 00:10:23,953
Let's hurry and finish this thing.

183
00:10:24,632 --> 00:10:26,301
Here. Hold this pipe for me.

184
00:10:26,727 --> 00:10:27,434
Okay.

185
00:10:49,569 --> 00:10:53,581
W-What's exactly gonna happen if
I fire my gun into that pipe, huh?

186
00:10:58,473 --> 00:11:00,419
Come on! Turn the damn page, would you?!

187
00:11:00,599 --> 00:11:03,667
I know I fire my gun into the
pipe, but what happens after that?

188
00:11:04,571 --> 00:11:07,933
"Once they're fired, the bullets go
through the pipe and out the other end."

189
00:11:08,525 --> 00:11:13,462
"Ka-boom! Hol horse's bullets hit their
Mark and fly straight through Jotaro's skull,"

190
00:11:13,584 --> 00:11:15,995
"right smack in the middle of his forehead!"

191
00:11:16,108 --> 00:11:17,281
Yes. Yes!

192
00:11:17,795 --> 00:11:20,030
It's finally happening! Yes!

193
00:11:20,177 --> 00:11:22,026
Our time's come, yes!

194
00:11:22,051 --> 00:11:25,243
I've been waiting for this
since my brother's accident, yes!

195
00:11:26,084 --> 00:11:27,431
That's great, Mondatta.

196
00:11:28,493 --> 00:11:31,255
I mean, it looks great, but hold on a sec.

197
00:11:31,932 --> 00:11:32,420
Hmm?

198
00:11:32,452 --> 00:11:36,015
Let's make sure we give it a thorough
once-over so we don't get our bacon cooked.

199
00:11:36,526 --> 00:11:37,010
Huh?

200
00:11:37,447 --> 00:11:39,927
W-What's happening on this page?

201
00:11:40,454 --> 00:11:44,284
Hey, this is the prediction from when
your brother tried to wipe out Jotaro.

202
00:11:44,951 --> 00:11:48,192
But in the end, your brother was
the one who got himself blown up.

203
00:11:48,705 --> 00:11:53,106
Yeah, but my brother transformed himself
into Jotaro without giving it any thought.

204
00:11:53,146 --> 00:11:56,159
If he hadn't, the prediction would have come true, yes.

205
00:11:56,739 --> 00:12:02,177
B-b-but that's not going to happen to us,
because you and I can't transform ourselves, yes.

206
00:12:02,304 --> 00:12:04,107
Oh, yeah, you're right.

207
00:12:04,174 --> 00:12:05,895
I don't have changing powers,

208
00:12:06,156 --> 00:12:08,686
so I couldn't pretend to be Jotaro if I wanted to.

209
00:12:09,445 --> 00:12:11,342
Wait! Then does that mean...

210
00:12:11,682 --> 00:12:13,462
It does indeed, yes!

211
00:12:13,622 --> 00:12:16,543
At last I can avenge my brother, yes!

212
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:20,336
There's absolutely no way to
misinterpret this prophecy, yes.

213
00:12:20,396 --> 00:12:23,056
All you have to do is shoot your bullets into this pipe,

214
00:12:23,129 --> 00:12:26,627
and Jotaro will meet his maker, yes!

215
00:12:32,233 --> 00:12:33,338
Let's back up a bit.

216
00:12:33,891 --> 00:12:36,075
It gave us a specific time to do it, right?

217
00:12:36,488 --> 00:12:38,510
It's gotta be done by the stroke of noon.

218
00:12:38,964 --> 00:12:39,634
Hmm.

219
00:12:41,636 --> 00:12:42,405
Huh?!

220
00:12:42,743 --> 00:12:48,243
Hey! Your magic prediction comic book neglected to
mention we only have two minutes left before 12:00.

221
00:12:49,327 --> 00:12:51,018
D-don't panic!

222
00:12:51,876 --> 00:12:55,006
All you have to do is aim your gun and fire, yes.

223
00:12:55,059 --> 00:12:56,949
You have more than enough time, yes.

224
00:12:56,974 --> 00:12:59,540
Just believe in fate. It'll work itself out.

225
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:01,000
Yeah, I know. I know!

226
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:04,550
It's 100% I believe you. I really do, but...

227
00:13:07,176 --> 00:13:09,737
We're down to the wire, and time's against us.

228
00:13:10,275 --> 00:13:12,372
I've gotta haul ass!

229
00:13:12,741 --> 00:13:14,696
You there, worker guys, listen up!

230
00:13:14,932 --> 00:13:16,676
This is a matter of life and death.

231
00:13:16,964 --> 00:13:19,496
I need one of you to open that pipe on the double!

232
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:20,511
Hmm?

233
00:13:20,535 --> 00:13:21,456
Huh?

234
00:13:22,449 --> 00:13:24,084
Just do it, all right?

235
00:13:24,644 --> 00:13:27,575
Hey, who exactly do you think you're barking orders at?

236
00:13:27,621 --> 00:13:30,183
Who do think you are, pal? Take a hike.

237
00:13:30,629 --> 00:13:33,046
Open the pipe, or you can die!

238
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:38,211
Hol horse, you should know that ordinary people
don't have the ability to see your stand, yes.

239
00:13:38,236 --> 00:13:38,878
Huh?

240
00:13:39,211 --> 00:13:39,862
Huh?

241
00:13:40,968 --> 00:13:45,200
According to the premonition in the comic,
you're supposed to pay the workers, yes.

242
00:13:45,227 --> 00:13:46,487
Huh? Pay them?

243
00:13:48,693 --> 00:13:51,452
Only a minute, ten seconds left before showtime!

244
00:13:51,496 --> 00:13:54,154
All right, all right, sorry about the attitude.

245
00:13:54,202 --> 00:13:57,679
I'll pay you to open the pipe,
but you have to do it now! Please.

246
00:13:57,704 --> 00:14:00,076
Now you're gonna pay us? Weirdo.

247
00:14:00,356 --> 00:14:02,551
Why would you give us money to open the pipe?

248
00:14:02,611 --> 00:14:03,844
Does it really matter?

249
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:05,006
Hand over what you got.

250
00:14:05,303 --> 00:14:06,527
Yeah, okay.

251
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:11,619
Oh, no. Where is...

252
00:14:11,644 --> 00:14:13,492
Yo, what's the holdup, man?

253
00:14:14,499 --> 00:14:15,669
I'm flat broke!

254
00:14:15,965 --> 00:14:18,860
Oh, that's right. I left my wallet at the hotel!

255
00:14:18,954 --> 00:14:19,748
Huh?

256
00:14:19,773 --> 00:14:21,292
What's with this guy?

257
00:14:21,899 --> 00:14:22,809
Mondatta!

258
00:14:23,025 --> 00:14:26,066
Remember the money I gave to you
just in case you ended up getting lost?

259
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:29,627
Well, I need you to give it back
to me, so fork it over now, Mondatta!

260
00:14:29,834 --> 00:14:30,707
Right. Let's see.

261
00:14:31,845 --> 00:14:34,317
Crap! We've only got 40 seconds left.

262
00:14:34,342 --> 00:14:35,948
Move your ass!

263
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:38,916
I-I don't know if this is enough,

264
00:14:39,038 --> 00:14:40,381
but go ahead, and take it.

265
00:14:44,890 --> 00:14:48,068
Hey, I think I saw one of 'em roll behind the bricks.

266
00:14:48,828 --> 00:14:52,146
They're just coins, but there are a lot of 'em. Nice.

267
00:14:52,411 --> 00:14:54,190
Must be at least £20.

268
00:14:54,317 --> 00:14:56,087
Hey, man, watch your feet. You're steppin' on one.

269
00:14:56,118 --> 00:14:56,778
What's that?

270
00:14:57,479 --> 00:15:00,671
Pick the damn coins up later! You can have 'em all, okay?

271
00:15:00,919 --> 00:15:02,567
Here you go, boys.

272
00:15:02,727 --> 00:15:04,386
It's getting close to noon.

273
00:15:04,493 --> 00:15:08,565
I made you boys some tea, so take
a load off, and have some lunch.

274
00:15:08,596 --> 00:15:10,282
Oh, sounds good to me.

275
00:15:10,363 --> 00:15:13,428
Listen, granny! I found 'em first, so get lost!

276
00:15:13,613 --> 00:15:15,170
Thank you very much, ma'am.

277
00:15:17,114 --> 00:15:18,303
Put 'em down!

278
00:15:18,328 --> 00:15:20,340
I told you to hurry up and open the pipe!

279
00:15:20,364 --> 00:15:22,304
If you don't, I'll crack your skulls!

280
00:15:29,333 --> 00:15:30,660
There. It's open.

281
00:15:31,112 --> 00:15:31,793
Move it!

282
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:37,114
Now die, Jotaro!

283
00:15:40,059 --> 00:15:40,982
I won!

284
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:44,740
Just like the prediction said, I shot
the cocky bastard at the stroke of noon.

285
00:15:45,014 --> 00:15:46,115
Go get him.

286
00:15:54,459 --> 00:15:56,094
Old man, time to get up.

287
00:15:59,893 --> 00:16:02,754
Uh, I don't think there's any permanent damage.

288
00:16:03,748 --> 00:16:05,758
I only have cuts and bruises.

289
00:16:06,205 --> 00:16:08,080
But Polnareff, on the other hand...

290
00:16:08,578 --> 00:16:09,051
Hmm?

291
00:16:10,144 --> 00:16:12,141
Hey, don't mean to be a nuisance,

292
00:16:12,166 --> 00:16:15,072
but could someone get this damn thing off of me?

293
00:16:19,906 --> 00:16:20,726
I won.

294
00:16:21,026 --> 00:16:22,579
This is really gonna happen.

295
00:16:22,652 --> 00:16:24,532
Jotaro is right in front of that pipe.

296
00:16:36,731 --> 00:16:37,532
Ugh!

297
00:16:42,241 --> 00:16:43,324
What?!

298
00:16:45,934 --> 00:16:46,887
Watch it.

299
00:16:48,358 --> 00:16:49,994
Sorry about that, Jotaro.

300
00:16:50,168 --> 00:16:51,866
I don't know what Hol Horse was thinking,

301
00:16:51,891 --> 00:16:56,021
but he decided sticking his fingers up my nose
would be the perfect way to spend the evening.

302
00:16:56,119 --> 00:16:58,261
That guy is tres disgusting.

303
00:16:58,681 --> 00:17:00,340
Man, my nose still itches.

304
00:17:00,625 --> 00:17:01,931
So sorry again.

305
00:17:02,465 --> 00:17:04,464
But how's it possible?

306
00:17:04,919 --> 00:17:06,657
My bullets missed!

307
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:10,276
What the hell?!

308
00:17:10,342 --> 00:17:12,478
Were you trying to pull one over on me?

309
00:17:12,644 --> 00:17:14,509
What the hell is going on around here?!

310
00:17:14,554 --> 00:17:16,302
I have no idea, yes!

311
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:20,503
Like I said, m-my predictions always come true! It's fate!

312
00:17:20,596 --> 00:17:21,793
I can't believe it.

313
00:17:21,858 --> 00:17:26,214
Not once since I started using my
stand have my predictions ever been wrong!

314
00:17:26,315 --> 00:17:29,720
Well, clearly there's a first time for
everything, 'cause they're still alive.

315
00:17:29,807 --> 00:17:31,658
Not a single bullet hit its Mark.

316
00:17:31,877 --> 00:17:34,530
It's safe to say your prediction was totally wrong.

317
00:17:35,297 --> 00:17:36,117
Damn you!

318
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:39,287
Thanks for joining us for today's broadcast.

319
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:42,780
Be sure to tune in next time. Now for the 12:00 news.

320
00:17:44,423 --> 00:17:45,050
Huh?

321
00:17:48,507 --> 00:17:49,550
What the hell?

322
00:17:50,387 --> 00:17:52,813
There's no way in hell it's just now noon.

323
00:17:54,370 --> 00:17:55,718
I know what happened.

324
00:17:56,054 --> 00:17:57,789
M-my watch is...

325
00:17:59,593 --> 00:18:01,286
My watch is fast!

326
00:18:02,027 --> 00:18:06,208
And that means I ended up firing
off the bullets before it was time!

327
00:18:06,313 --> 00:18:07,759
But now it is noon.

328
00:18:08,046 --> 00:18:09,625
What's that mean for us, huh?

329
00:18:09,958 --> 00:18:10,704
Tell me.

330
00:18:11,216 --> 00:18:14,455
What the hell's gonna happen to
us now that we've gone off script?

331
00:18:15,782 --> 00:18:17,514
No, it can't be.

332
00:18:23,108 --> 00:18:24,565
But where did we get off track?

333
00:18:24,919 --> 00:18:28,630
It said the bullets would go right through
Jotaro's forehead at the stroke of noon.

334
00:18:28,655 --> 00:18:30,205
Hol Horse, the bullets are...

335
00:18:30,236 --> 00:18:31,103
Come on.

336
00:18:31,128 --> 00:18:33,303
All I need to know is what's gonna happen next.

337
00:18:44,045 --> 00:18:44,476
Hmm?

338
00:18:45,006 --> 00:18:48,975
Hey, tell me I'm not the only one
who heard that ear-piercing scream.

339
00:18:49,315 --> 00:18:52,776
I'm not clear on the details, but
there's something fishy going on here.

340
00:18:52,936 --> 00:18:54,878
But the bigger concern is this truck.

341
00:18:55,111 --> 00:18:58,022
I think we'd better get out of
here before the cops start showing up.

342
00:18:58,286 --> 00:18:59,354
Let's move, men.

343
00:18:59,379 --> 00:19:00,700
But before we go,

344
00:19:00,827 --> 00:19:02,927
I wanna know where Hol Horse ran off to.

345
00:19:03,227 --> 00:19:05,908
I don't know. He disappeared for some reason.

346
00:19:12,752 --> 00:19:16,321
Hey, if you don't get away from that
pipe, you're going to get soaking wet.

347
00:19:16,594 --> 00:19:18,140
You should try to be more careful.

348
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:18,946
Hmph.

349
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:26,079
Is he dead?

350
00:19:26,393 --> 00:19:28,006
No, but he's critical.

351
00:19:28,806 --> 00:19:32,258
I couldn't even begin to tell
you what transpired here today.

352
00:19:32,726 --> 00:19:37,503
They looked him over, and it seems as though the bullet
went through his forehead and out the top of his head.

353
00:19:37,803 --> 00:19:40,278
One centimeter lower, and he would have been a goner.

354
00:19:40,325 --> 00:19:43,841
Whew. Gotta say that is one lucky man.

355
00:19:48,769 --> 00:19:51,219
In the end, it seems my prediction was right,

356
00:19:52,183 --> 00:19:55,425
which means this was Hol Horse's fate all along.

357
00:19:56,466 --> 00:19:58,752
Jotaro is really something else.

358
00:19:59,079 --> 00:20:01,119
How lucky can one person be?

359
00:20:01,567 --> 00:20:04,759
Both my brother and Hol Horse were defeated by fate.

360
00:20:04,952 --> 00:20:07,845
At this point, we stand users are wasting our time.

361
00:20:07,878 --> 00:20:10,148
Master Dio's the only one who can defeat him.

362
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:14,283
You know what, Zenyatta?

363
00:20:14,723 --> 00:20:17,228
Hol Horse, that big buffoon of a man,

364
00:20:17,355 --> 00:20:20,406
taught me that revenge is
nothing more than a massive joke,

365
00:20:20,999 --> 00:20:24,074
so I'm going to forget about Jotaro.

366
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:26,317
I have a new path in life.

367
00:20:26,474 --> 00:20:30,210
I'll use my stand's powers to
help as many people as I can.

368
00:20:30,496 --> 00:20:32,882
I'll use them to bring happiness to everyone.

369
00:20:33,748 --> 00:20:35,787
Maybe people will start to like us,

370
00:20:35,894 --> 00:20:38,374
and just maybe our future will be brighter.

371
00:20:43,696 --> 00:20:45,194
I'm tired of being afraid.

372
00:20:45,218 --> 00:20:48,723
Today's the last day I spend
under a box cowering from everyone.

373
00:20:49,196 --> 00:20:50,806
I learned a lot from this battle,

374
00:20:50,864 --> 00:20:52,268
more than I thought I could.

375
00:20:52,719 --> 00:20:54,454
I'm coming home now, brother.

376
00:20:54,688 --> 00:20:57,271
I'm coming home to Aswan to join you.

377
00:20:59,437 --> 00:20:59,837
Eh?

378
00:21:01,221 --> 00:21:03,200
Oh, my gosh, I am so sorry!

379
00:21:03,263 --> 00:21:04,720
I kicked it without thinking.

380
00:21:05,624 --> 00:21:08,128
I didn't mean to hit you. Please forgive me.

381
00:21:08,621 --> 00:21:10,576
Hold on. This dog...

382
00:21:10,616 --> 00:21:12,167
He looks familiar.

383
00:21:12,312 --> 00:21:15,901
I pretty sure I've seen him before, but where?

384
00:21:18,167 --> 00:21:19,782
There's no way!

385
00:21:19,902 --> 00:21:21,030
It can't be!

386
00:21:22,037 --> 00:21:26,208
No!

387
00:21:26,838 --> 00:21:30,486
Hey, now that I think about
it, where'd our dumb-ass dog go?

388
00:21:30,866 --> 00:21:32,174
You talking about Iggy?

389
00:21:32,335 --> 00:21:34,816
I'm sure he's scrounging around for food somewhere.

390
00:21:34,931 --> 00:21:37,932
I've said from the beginning he
wouldn't help us when we needed him.

391
00:21:39,810 --> 00:21:42,224
"He should have known it wouldn't be so simple.

392
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:44,497
"If people could change that easily,

393
00:21:44,557 --> 00:21:45,950
life wouldn't be so hard."

394
00:21:47,085 --> 00:21:48,542
"So as fate would have it,

395
00:21:48,567 --> 00:21:50,895
"Mondatta joined Hol Horse in the hospital,

396
00:21:51,048 --> 00:21:54,061
only now he was meeker than ever before."

397
00:21:54,985 --> 00:21:56,563
Ba-dum-tss.
