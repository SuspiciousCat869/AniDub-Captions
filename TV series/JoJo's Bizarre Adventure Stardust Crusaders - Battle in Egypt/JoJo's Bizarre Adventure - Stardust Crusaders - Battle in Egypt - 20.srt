1
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:06,220
This room looks like it was on
the receiving end of a tornado.

2
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:10,174
I don't understand how this
hole could be perfectly spherical.

3
00:00:10,567 --> 00:00:12,213
What is going on?

4
00:00:12,659 --> 00:00:16,061
I'm not sure, but the destruction
spreads into the other room, too.

5
00:00:16,253 --> 00:00:20,002
It's safe to say Avdol and the
others made contact with the enemy.

6
00:00:20,684 --> 00:00:21,562
Here we go.

7
00:00:21,642 --> 00:00:24,294
Break down this door, Jotaro. We're going in.

8
00:00:24,745 --> 00:00:25,378
Roger.

9
00:00:26,853 --> 00:00:27,711
Ora!

10
00:02:05,043 --> 00:02:07,357
Au revoir, Iggy.

11
00:02:50,807 --> 00:02:57,301
Polnareff, the blood that stains my
body is Avdol's handiwork, not yours.

12
00:02:59,885 --> 00:03:03,150
My plan was to eradicate you both simultaneously,

13
00:03:03,201 --> 00:03:06,844
but due to Avdol's intervention,
your demise was postponed.

14
00:03:07,746 --> 00:03:10,404
Anyone else would have instinctively saved himself

15
00:03:10,458 --> 00:03:14,518
over risking life and limb to come
to the aid of an oblivious comrade.

16
00:03:14,586 --> 00:03:18,017
That alone makes him responsible for my injuries.

17
00:03:18,176 --> 00:03:23,073
He may have been able to injure me, but it'll
take far more than that to send me to the grave.

18
00:03:23,802 --> 00:03:26,709
Now I'll set my sights on the other interlopers.

19
00:03:26,778 --> 00:03:28,942
I'll kill them in the name of lord Dio.

20
00:03:33,961 --> 00:03:34,667
Damn it.

21
00:03:34,706 --> 00:03:39,182
I told you not to use your stand, Iggy,
but you just had to show off, didn't you?

22
00:03:40,597 --> 00:03:41,856
Stupid dog.

23
00:03:42,021 --> 00:03:43,391
Why'd you have to do it?

24
00:03:43,769 --> 00:03:44,591
Polnareff?

25
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:51,258
As far as Cool Ice was concerned, Iggy was nothing
more than a filthy stray without resolve or pride,

26
00:03:51,671 --> 00:03:55,539
but by its very nature, a stand
is a manifestation of the soul,

27
00:03:55,582 --> 00:04:00,418
and Iggy's had acted of its own volition
with something compelling it from deep within.

28
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:09,623
His sand, its spirit is gone.

29
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:11,954
How could this have happened?

30
00:04:12,178 --> 00:04:12,834
Damn it.

31
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:16,130
All that's left is a lifeless husk.

32
00:04:16,308 --> 00:04:18,132
The chill of death is in the air,

33
00:04:18,517 --> 00:04:21,360
and another life has been cut short far too soon.

34
00:04:22,027 --> 00:04:24,510
Why am I the only one who survived?

35
00:04:27,527 --> 00:04:28,095
Ig...

36
00:04:30,837 --> 00:04:32,050
Iggy!

37
00:04:36,064 --> 00:04:38,737
You're too slow for your own good, Cool Ice,

38
00:04:38,871 --> 00:04:40,010
but you know something?

39
00:04:40,446 --> 00:04:41,239
You're right.

40
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:43,297
I had some pretty selfless friends, huh?

41
00:04:43,476 --> 00:04:46,857
I was supposed to look out for
Iggy, but instead he saved my ass.

42
00:05:03,389 --> 00:05:04,138
Damn it.

43
00:05:05,195 --> 00:05:07,015
How could this be happening?

44
00:05:07,773 --> 00:05:10,599
I've only just begun to realize what he meant to me.

45
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:13,422
This is how it always is.

46
00:05:13,785 --> 00:05:15,924
I don't get it until after they're gone.

47
00:05:16,552 --> 00:05:18,929
You were a miserable little mutt from the start,

48
00:05:19,239 --> 00:05:23,113
but despite that, you never failed
to find new ways to impress me.

49
00:05:24,183 --> 00:05:27,709
You were a proud bastard who lived life by your own rules,

50
00:05:27,849 --> 00:05:31,454
and we were the ones who mistook
your self-respect as indifference.

51
00:05:32,214 --> 00:05:34,300
I told you not to save me.

52
00:05:36,133 --> 00:05:39,508
Damn it, flea bag, why'd you have to be so stubborn?

53
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:00,382
I knew it.

54
00:06:00,448 --> 00:06:03,442
I've figured out what you are, Cool Ice.

55
00:06:26,714 --> 00:06:29,020
I knew there was something was strange about you.

56
00:06:29,218 --> 00:06:30,367
You're an immortal.

57
00:06:30,726 --> 00:06:33,213
Dio somehow found a way to transform you.

58
00:06:41,704 --> 00:06:43,814
W-What the hell is this?

59
00:06:44,257 --> 00:06:46,583
What's happening to me?!

60
00:06:46,739 --> 00:06:50,952
Obviously your precious master made
the changes without your knowledge.

61
00:06:51,418 --> 00:06:53,466
He gave you his blood, didn't he?

62
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:56,834
Guess he left out the part
about you turning into a vampire.

63
00:06:57,807 --> 00:06:59,660
You're just like Dio now,

64
00:07:00,119 --> 00:07:02,788
a disgusting, soulless vampire.

65
00:07:03,822 --> 00:07:05,045
You bastard!

66
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:13,002
Since you're only feeling it now,

67
00:07:13,115 --> 00:07:15,759
the change must have started after I stabbed you.

68
00:07:16,139 --> 00:07:16,808
Come on.

69
00:07:17,258 --> 00:07:20,277
You made a vow to protect your lord and master, right?

70
00:07:20,419 --> 00:07:22,578
What are you waiting for? Bring it.

71
00:07:23,637 --> 00:07:25,537
Go on! Do your worst!

72
00:07:25,663 --> 00:07:28,444
Hey, what's the holdup, Cool Ice? I'm waiting.

73
00:07:28,469 --> 00:07:31,382
You're not going to defeat me!

74
00:07:32,257 --> 00:07:34,099
Now go to hell, asshole.

75
00:08:20,694 --> 00:08:22,580
A-Avdol, wait.

76
00:08:23,045 --> 00:08:24,266
I-Iggy!

77
00:08:33,198 --> 00:08:36,549
Was... was that my imagination?

78
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,477
Or was it really...

79
00:08:45,101 --> 00:08:47,408
I don't have time to sit and ponder.

80
00:08:47,949 --> 00:08:51,942
All that matters now is making
it upstairs and finding Dio.

81
00:08:52,451 --> 00:08:53,757
Mourning can wait.

82
00:08:54,266 --> 00:08:57,005
I can't fall apart after everything they sacrificed.

83
00:09:18,742 --> 00:09:24,062
Japan. 43 days had passed since JoJo and
the others began their journey to Egypt.

84
00:09:24,422 --> 00:09:26,012
Rosas, stop the car.

85
00:09:26,544 --> 00:09:28,262
Hit the brakes. I want to get out.

86
00:09:30,486 --> 00:09:33,045
Madame Joestar, I don't mean to overstep,

87
00:09:33,103 --> 00:09:35,731
but is now really the best time to stop at a soba stand?

88
00:09:35,805 --> 00:09:38,677
Well, of course. I haven't been to Japan in a while.

89
00:09:38,727 --> 00:09:41,659
I'd like to grab a quick bite
before visiting my little girl.

90
00:09:41,744 --> 00:09:44,464
Hon, would you be a dear and hold on to my turtle?

91
00:09:45,975 --> 00:09:47,601
Please, madam, you mustn't.

92
00:09:47,867 --> 00:09:50,473
Places such as these are for common businessmen.

93
00:09:50,513 --> 00:09:53,379
Ladies of your pedigree should
only dine at fine restaurants.

94
00:09:53,468 --> 00:09:55,885
I am begging you, madam. Don't go in there.

95
00:09:55,978 --> 00:09:57,439
Lighten up, Rosas.

96
00:09:57,464 --> 00:09:59,596
It's so quaint, I just have to record it.

97
00:09:59,702 --> 00:10:02,859
Oh, the local flavor is simply to die for.

98
00:10:02,932 --> 00:10:04,579
Oh, this'll be a good shot.

99
00:10:09,906 --> 00:10:10,984
Mr. Rosas.

100
00:10:11,016 --> 00:10:11,450
Huh?

101
00:10:11,774 --> 00:10:16,386
Judging by the madam's cavalier attitude, I
take it you've not told her about Holly's condition.

102
00:10:18,915 --> 00:10:20,927
Hey, what's the holdup, Rosas?

103
00:10:20,952 --> 00:10:21,879
Get over here!

104
00:10:21,904 --> 00:10:24,093
Oh, I'm right behind you, madam.

105
00:10:28,598 --> 00:10:31,537
No, I haven't uttered a single word.

106
00:10:31,736 --> 00:10:35,754
As far as she knows, her daughter is
battling a severe case of pneumonia.

107
00:10:36,824 --> 00:10:40,299
I've worked for the Joestar family for the past 30 years.

108
00:10:40,612 --> 00:10:44,558
As for Miss Holly, I've known her since
she was a little girl in grade school.

109
00:10:45,088 --> 00:10:48,035
Believe me, I know that I have to tell her the truth,

110
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:51,290
but I just don't have the heart.

111
00:10:51,394 --> 00:10:54,284
Even coming to Japan hasn't given me the courage.

112
00:10:54,751 --> 00:10:56,178
Holly doesn't have long.

113
00:10:56,202 --> 00:11:00,127
If she's not saved, she'll
likely die within the next few days.

114
00:11:00,183 --> 00:11:02,967
Would you prefer that I told Madam Joestar, sir?

115
00:11:03,297 --> 00:11:09,444
No, thank you, but I've made my bed with the falsehoods
I've told the madam, and now I have to lie in it.

116
00:11:10,168 --> 00:11:12,241
I have to be the one to inform her.

117
00:11:13,443 --> 00:11:18,862
Tell me, are you absolutely sure the curse
afflicting miss Holly will be lifted if Dio is killed?

118
00:11:18,908 --> 00:11:22,441
I am. Dio's demise will end this. Trust me.

119
00:11:24,153 --> 00:11:27,790
Holly's body is reacting to energy
from something known as a stand,

120
00:11:28,139 --> 00:11:31,207
but only people with said
stands can observe the phenomenon.

121
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:35,181
Put simply, Dio's dark energy is slowly destroying her,

122
00:11:35,788 --> 00:11:37,896
but madam cannot see the stands.

123
00:11:38,067 --> 00:11:42,250
Instead, she'll have to bear witness to
her only daughter in the throes of death.

124
00:11:42,419 --> 00:11:45,549
She must know. The time for secrets is over.

125
00:11:46,089 --> 00:11:48,087
Yes. Yes, you're right.

126
00:11:48,257 --> 00:11:49,707
There you are, Rosas.

127
00:11:49,732 --> 00:11:51,500
What are you still doing out here?

128
00:11:51,534 --> 00:11:54,666
Instead of sulking around, come have some curry udon.

129
00:11:57,757 --> 00:11:59,217
Please, listen, madam.

130
00:11:59,396 --> 00:12:00,829
There is something that I need to tell...

131
00:12:00,854 --> 00:12:06,418
Oh! Oh, I must get some footage of this
delightful little health-drink vending machine.

132
00:12:06,489 --> 00:12:07,989
Another good shot!

133
00:12:08,344 --> 00:12:10,304
Would you like me to get you one, Rosas?

134
00:12:10,339 --> 00:12:15,573
Wait! Madam Joestar, you have to stop this.
Despite appearances, those aren't drinks, madam!

135
00:12:15,796 --> 00:12:17,429
Please, you have to listen to me!

136
00:12:17,454 --> 00:12:19,115
My! What is it?

137
00:12:19,854 --> 00:12:23,034
Well, uh, it's about miss Holly.

138
00:12:23,078 --> 00:12:28,386
Ooh! Look at this Japanese man's
unique fashion sense. Very nice.

139
00:12:28,424 --> 00:12:29,816
Hi there. How are you?

140
00:12:29,876 --> 00:12:31,857
Give me a big smile, if you would.

141
00:12:31,931 --> 00:12:34,073
Huh? What the hell are you doin', lady?

142
00:12:34,189 --> 00:12:37,063
Who gave you permission to videotape me, huh?

143
00:12:38,283 --> 00:12:39,622
Please, madam, get in the car.

144
00:12:39,656 --> 00:12:40,908
Nice to meet you.

145
00:12:40,964 --> 00:12:42,206
Come back here, damn it!

146
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:43,647
We're not done!

147
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:46,220
I'll be taking that camera from you before you leave.

148
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:49,537
Who do you think you are?! You're just a damn foreign hag.

149
00:12:49,765 --> 00:12:52,639
You lookin' to see some blood today, you rich bitch? Huh?!

150
00:12:52,944 --> 00:12:54,820
All right, that's enough.

151
00:12:55,175 --> 00:12:57,928
I forbid you to lay another finger on madam.

152
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:04,510
Madam, you should try learning a
bit more about Japanese culture.

153
00:13:04,535 --> 00:13:05,423
Okay.

154
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:10,242
I couldn't do it.

155
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:13,450
I couldn't tell her Miss Holly only has a few days left.

156
00:13:13,543 --> 00:13:14,944
It would break her heart,

157
00:13:15,262 --> 00:13:17,511
and that's the last thing I would ever want to do.

158
00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:35,549
We've almost arrived, and I still haven't told her.

159
00:13:36,316 --> 00:13:38,089
I can't put this off any longer.

160
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:40,793
We'll soon be in sight of the Kujo house.

161
00:13:41,404 --> 00:13:43,379
She needs to hear this from me.

162
00:13:47,529 --> 00:13:48,477
It's okay.

163
00:13:48,757 --> 00:13:50,885
I know there's something you want to tell me.

164
00:13:51,647 --> 00:13:53,616
You don't need to pretend anymore.

165
00:13:53,862 --> 00:13:56,353
I'm well aware of what's troubling you, Rosas.

166
00:13:56,731 --> 00:13:59,345
My daughter's life is in grave danger, isn't it?

167
00:14:06,987 --> 00:14:09,409
I called Holly from New York a few times.

168
00:14:09,544 --> 00:14:12,891
She put on a brave face and
pretended to be cheerful and lively.

169
00:14:13,255 --> 00:14:16,751
She tried her best to convince me it was only a mild cold.

170
00:14:17,227 --> 00:14:21,437
Whenever Joseph phoned, he would tell
me his business trip kept him very busy,

171
00:14:21,704 --> 00:14:23,852
but that I had nothing to worry about,

172
00:14:24,824 --> 00:14:27,704
but I knew they were keeping something important from me.

173
00:14:28,263 --> 00:14:32,220
Deep down, I knew something terrible
was happening to my daughter and husband.

174
00:14:32,646 --> 00:14:35,397
I've been married to Joseph for 50 years now,

175
00:14:35,616 --> 00:14:38,329
and my sweet Holly is my own flesh and blood.

176
00:14:39,835 --> 00:14:44,041
I never pressed them for more information,
because I was afraid of what they'd say.

177
00:14:44,429 --> 00:14:47,262
I wanted nothing more than to see my precious daughter,

178
00:14:47,549 --> 00:14:50,515
but the thought of what I'd find here was almost too much.

179
00:14:51,479 --> 00:14:52,669
You know this much,

180
00:14:52,749 --> 00:14:54,931
so you also have the right to know the rest.

181
00:14:54,958 --> 00:14:58,142
As it stands, your daughter
only has a few days left to live.

182
00:14:58,187 --> 00:15:01,023
That's why Mr. Joestar and the others went to Egypt,

183
00:15:01,143 --> 00:15:02,849
to end the source of her illness,

184
00:15:03,254 --> 00:15:05,375
but there's been no news for a while.

185
00:15:05,894 --> 00:15:09,807
Please, can you find it in your
heart to forgive me for not telling you?

186
00:15:10,406 --> 00:15:12,642
There was nothing we could do for Miss Holly,

187
00:15:12,675 --> 00:15:15,299
so I wanted to spare you from the pain, but I was wrong.

188
00:15:15,338 --> 00:15:18,420
I should have told you. It was cruel of me not to.

189
00:15:20,049 --> 00:15:22,897
I don't want to hear any more of that foolishness, Rosas.

190
00:15:23,653 --> 00:15:27,495
No matter how grim things seem, there's
still one thing we can do for Holly.

191
00:15:50,801 --> 00:15:51,814
Hi, sweet girl.

192
00:16:00,516 --> 00:16:02,695
I'm so glad you're here.

193
00:16:04,066 --> 00:16:06,214
Listen to me very carefully, Rosas.

194
00:16:06,401 --> 00:16:10,424
Right now, the one thing we can
do for my daughter is have faith.

195
00:16:11,524 --> 00:16:13,944
I don't understand everything that's happening,

196
00:16:14,097 --> 00:16:15,817
but here's what I do know.

197
00:16:16,218 --> 00:16:21,378
Joseph and my grandson Jotaro are putting their
lives on the line in the hope of saving Holly,

198
00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:24,416
and I believe they will find a way to do just that.

199
00:16:24,615 --> 00:16:28,532
He's never failed me, not once
in the 50 years I have known him.

200
00:16:28,589 --> 00:16:32,052
He's kept every promise he's made
since the two of us met in Italy.

201
00:16:32,261 --> 00:16:36,664
Once he's made up his mind to do
something, nothing in this world can stop him.

202
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,698
Rest and believe in Jotaro and your father.

203
00:16:40,930 --> 00:16:42,908
You'll be better before you know it,

204
00:16:42,978 --> 00:16:45,294
and our family will be together once again.

205
00:16:46,375 --> 00:16:47,684
Thank you, mama.

206
00:16:50,899 --> 00:16:53,201
Madam Joestar, Miss Holly,

207
00:16:53,362 --> 00:16:54,941
please hang in there.

208
00:17:09,648 --> 00:17:12,158
That Cool Ice, Billie Jean,

209
00:17:12,190 --> 00:17:14,031
even Darby younger...

210
00:17:14,966 --> 00:17:17,836
I knew they were nothing but incompetent fools.

211
00:17:25,979 --> 00:17:27,123
I shouldn't laugh,

212
00:17:27,185 --> 00:17:31,169
but knowing they got what they
deserved feels so satisfying!

213
00:17:32,399 --> 00:17:35,161
That's what the fools get for calling me a loser.

214
00:17:35,404 --> 00:17:38,607
But at least now we know I wasn't one after all.

215
00:17:39,177 --> 00:17:40,454
Don't be absurd.

216
00:17:40,569 --> 00:17:44,164
You can't possibly defeat the
Joestars using that pathetic power.

217
00:17:44,193 --> 00:17:45,681
Out of the way, loser.

218
00:17:45,747 --> 00:17:47,632
Hey, but that's not fair!

219
00:17:47,678 --> 00:17:50,007
I want a chance to fight them, too!

220
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:52,552
You're merely an ordinary vampire.

221
00:17:52,638 --> 00:17:55,885
You'd best stay out of our way,
or we might end up killing you.

222
00:17:56,265 --> 00:17:58,913
Do try to behave yourself, loser.

223
00:18:02,225 --> 00:18:05,098
I'll be the one who finishes off Jotaro.

224
00:18:10,982 --> 00:18:11,542
Stop.

225
00:18:11,832 --> 00:18:13,388
There's something up ahead to the right.

226
00:18:24,899 --> 00:18:25,640
A woman.

227
00:18:27,525 --> 00:18:29,270
Please have mercy on me.

228
00:18:29,410 --> 00:18:31,823
I'm begging you, don't suck my blood!

229
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:33,071
Anything but that!

230
00:18:33,363 --> 00:18:33,838
Huh?

231
00:18:35,177 --> 00:18:37,230
I swear I'll do whatever you want.

232
00:18:37,255 --> 00:18:39,730
Just let me live. That's all I'm asking.

233
00:18:41,227 --> 00:18:42,860
Hey, easy now.

234
00:18:43,058 --> 00:18:44,455
You need to calm down.

235
00:18:44,752 --> 00:18:46,332
I won't run away anymore.

236
00:18:46,494 --> 00:18:48,640
You can trust me. Please have mercy.

237
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:53,208
Just breathe. We aren't Dio's minions,
and we're certainly not vampires.

238
00:18:53,309 --> 00:18:57,071
We're the good guys, so just
calm down, and let us help you.

239
00:18:57,990 --> 00:18:59,070
You're good guys?

240
00:19:00,643 --> 00:19:01,518
Good guys?

241
00:19:01,938 --> 00:19:04,535
You're really not those evil vampires?

242
00:19:04,688 --> 00:19:06,950
You're actually going to help me get away from here?

243
00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:09,190
That's right. We're good.

244
00:19:14,892 --> 00:19:15,830
Real good...

245
00:19:15,910 --> 00:19:17,516
At punchin' evil in the face.

246
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:22,369
If you still want help, we'll be happy to oblige.

247
00:19:22,438 --> 00:19:25,076
We'll help by sending you on a one-way trip to hell.

248
00:19:25,167 --> 00:19:26,666
Sound good, Kakyoin?

249
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:32,755
How? Damn it.

250
00:19:32,869 --> 00:19:35,515
How? Tell me. How? How?

251
00:19:36,346 --> 00:19:38,034
How did you figure it out?

252
00:19:38,299 --> 00:19:40,771
My power is impossible to crack!

253
00:19:41,058 --> 00:19:44,843
Would this power have anything to do with
the face of a woman on the back of your head?

254
00:19:44,868 --> 00:19:48,778
For future reference, when you flip your
head, you should make sure your hands match, too.

255
00:19:48,803 --> 00:19:49,505
Eh?

256
00:19:49,884 --> 00:19:50,438
Huh?

257
00:19:51,963 --> 00:19:52,543
Ah!

258
00:19:52,610 --> 00:19:53,909
Shit. You're right.

259
00:19:54,072 --> 00:19:56,602
I never noticed. I'm an idiot!

260
00:19:56,789 --> 00:19:58,450
No, you're a loser.

261
00:19:58,850 --> 00:20:01,085
Now where is Dio's room? Out with it.

262
00:20:01,487 --> 00:20:03,720
Jotaro, try not to knock him unconscious.

263
00:20:03,771 --> 00:20:04,971
He can take us to Dio.

264
00:20:06,721 --> 00:20:09,525
How dare you? Don't you call me that.

265
00:20:09,550 --> 00:20:11,431
You're just like those other guys,

266
00:20:11,546 --> 00:20:13,314
so you'll meet the same fate.

267
00:20:14,155 --> 00:20:15,519
I'll kill you!

268
00:20:15,544 --> 00:20:17,762
Lord Dio's power's made me immortal,

269
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:20,510
and I'll use all of it to rip you to pieces!

270
00:20:23,373 --> 00:20:23,987
Eh?

271
00:20:24,347 --> 00:20:27,234
So unless I heard wrong, you
just said you were an immortal,

272
00:20:27,653 --> 00:20:29,634
so you're a vampire like Dio,

273
00:20:30,454 --> 00:20:35,513
in which case, I can use you as a practice
dummy for when I fight against the real thing.

274
00:20:35,538 --> 00:20:37,332
Eh? Oh, my god.

275
00:20:49,239 --> 00:20:51,137
So you really are immortal.

276
00:20:51,312 --> 00:20:55,922
Vampire or not, we can still rip you into
little pieces and scatter them around the room.

277
00:20:56,205 --> 00:20:58,663
Well, are you takin' us to Dio or not?

278
00:20:58,907 --> 00:21:00,383
The sun is about to set.

279
00:21:00,675 --> 00:21:04,526
Okay, but can I at least ask you one thing?

280
00:21:04,551 --> 00:21:04,997
Hmm?

281
00:21:05,156 --> 00:21:09,133
How the hell did you know the other
stand users used to call me "loser"?

282
00:21:10,266 --> 00:21:12,055
Oh, man. Good grief.

283
00:22:49,588 --> 00:22:50,948
I gotta hand it to him.

284
00:22:51,186 --> 00:22:53,274
Dio's got some pretty nice curtains.

285
00:22:57,564 --> 00:23:01,081
All right, now I can walk and
even jump around if I need to.

286
00:23:01,785 --> 00:23:03,026
It still hurts a bit,

287
00:23:03,106 --> 00:23:05,506
but now's not the time to worry about a little pain.

288
00:23:06,435 --> 00:23:06,992
Hmm?

289
00:23:14,188 --> 00:23:16,849
Ah, greetings, Polnareff.

290
00:23:16,984 --> 00:23:18,843
What a pleasant surprise.

291
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:20,563
Dio.

292
00:23:21,477 --> 00:23:22,912
At last.
