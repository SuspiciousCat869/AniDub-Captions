1
00:00:00,375 --> 00:00:03,066
Previously on "JoJo's Bizarre Adventure"...

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:06,573
I don't think I'm gonna be able to help you folks.

3
00:00:06,598 --> 00:00:10,876
It's been my job to repair rooftops
in Cairo for around 40 years now,

4
00:00:11,166 --> 00:00:13,813
and I can't say that I've ever seen a place like this.

5
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:16,727
And my daughter's condition is much worse.

6
00:00:17,027 --> 00:00:19,353
At best, she has three or four days left.

7
00:00:20,886 --> 00:00:22,403
I can almost feel it.

8
00:00:22,476 --> 00:00:24,356
It's like Dio's right on top of us.

9
00:00:25,265 --> 00:00:26,342
We should get moving.

10
00:00:26,473 --> 00:00:28,702
We'll talk to everyone here until we find him.

11
00:00:36,332 --> 00:00:38,705
It's a real scorcher out here today.

12
00:00:39,545 --> 00:00:42,224
I haven't had a shower in almost two days.

13
00:00:42,424 --> 00:00:44,677
It's beginning to ruin my je ne sais quoi.

14
00:00:49,863 --> 00:00:50,326
Huh?

15
00:00:51,251 --> 00:00:52,361
Uh...

16
00:00:53,617 --> 00:00:54,616
Hmm.

17
00:00:58,711 --> 00:00:59,220
Hmm.

18
00:01:00,901 --> 00:01:01,356
Huh?

19
00:01:08,314 --> 00:01:08,830
Huh?

20
00:01:16,858 --> 00:01:18,729
What's the big idea, asshole?!

21
00:01:18,762 --> 00:01:20,144
You got some kind of problem with me?!

22
00:01:20,169 --> 00:01:21,972
I got a problem with where you're sitting!

23
00:01:21,997 --> 00:01:26,417
A cocky foreigner like you has no business
sitting here, pretending to be some kind of beggar!

24
00:01:26,442 --> 00:01:28,175
Don't you have a lick of common sense?!

25
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,817
Who said that you could sit here?!

26
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:30,477
Huh?

27
00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:33,427
Ah, you must be a beggar from a foreign land.

28
00:01:33,534 --> 00:01:36,017
I know this isn't much, but I hope it helps.

29
00:01:37,619 --> 00:01:38,985
Thanks, but...

30
00:01:39,278 --> 00:01:40,768
How dare you?!

31
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:41,993
Back off, pal!

32
00:01:42,033 --> 00:01:44,340
This is my turf, you poofy-haired blockhead!

33
00:01:44,365 --> 00:01:47,227
Huh? What's that supposed to...

34
00:01:47,535 --> 00:01:49,096
Hey, Polnareff!

35
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:51,668
Don't just sit there with your mouth agape.

36
00:01:51,982 --> 00:01:53,897
Give that money to him immediately.

37
00:01:55,278 --> 00:01:55,805
Huh?

38
00:01:56,478 --> 00:01:59,386
Oh, I get what's going on here. He's a beggar.

39
00:01:59,497 --> 00:02:01,987
You'll have to forgive my friend's obliviousness.

40
00:02:02,012 --> 00:02:04,151
He's not accustomed to the rules of this city.

41
00:02:04,545 --> 00:02:07,227
Why didn't you tell me you
were a beggar in the first place?

42
00:02:07,261 --> 00:02:09,340
It's called having a shtick, you numb-nut.

43
00:02:09,365 --> 00:02:11,432
People around here know me as a mute beggar.

44
00:02:11,637 --> 00:02:14,581
There's something known as a beggars association here.

45
00:02:14,641 --> 00:02:18,995
Beggars have their own areas where they're
paid to do nothing but sit around and beg all day.

46
00:02:19,165 --> 00:02:23,947
While it may seem strange to us, the rules they've
put in place help keep everything running smoothly.

47
00:02:24,401 --> 00:02:25,444
Get out.

48
00:02:25,893 --> 00:02:26,699
Yes,

49
00:02:26,724 --> 00:02:28,748
and that exchange from earlier has hurt my pride.

50
00:02:28,773 --> 00:02:29,157
Huh?

51
00:02:29,181 --> 00:02:33,065
I wonder if I'd make more money by
disguising myself as a foreign beggar.

52
00:02:33,473 --> 00:02:35,720
The hobos, the are a-changin'.

53
00:02:36,732 --> 00:02:39,852
Oh, by the way, I thought I recognized you from somewhere.

54
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:42,907
If I'm not mistaken, you're Avdol, the fortuneteller.

55
00:02:43,269 --> 00:02:46,590
Way I hear it, you got spooked and fled to Japan.

56
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,998
Apparently someone was lookin' to kill you.

57
00:02:49,276 --> 00:02:54,590
I'd rather discuss us needing a favor from the one
who knows everything there is to know about this area.

58
00:02:54,622 --> 00:02:56,463
You'll be well compensated.

59
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:59,084
Hmm. Ah!

60
00:03:00,144 --> 00:03:03,320
It's imperative that we find this
building as quickly as possible.

61
00:03:03,344 --> 00:03:04,671
We're running out of time.

62
00:03:04,785 --> 00:03:05,738
Ah.

63
00:03:16,578 --> 00:03:18,671
I've done enough work for one day.

64
00:03:21,206 --> 00:03:24,698
You gents have my word that I'll
find the mansion in three hours.

65
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:25,878
Just sit tight.

66
00:03:26,044 --> 00:03:26,504
Eh?

67
00:03:36,316 --> 00:03:39,807
By the way, did anyone see where Iggy ran off to?

68
00:06:58,304 --> 00:06:59,704
That's the place, all right.

69
00:07:00,138 --> 00:07:01,564
Mission accomplished.

70
00:07:03,034 --> 00:07:04,729
And it only took two hours.

71
00:07:05,047 --> 00:07:08,287
If it exists in this city, you
can bet your ass I'll find it.

72
00:07:08,734 --> 00:07:09,166
Huh?

73
00:07:24,597 --> 00:07:26,232
Iggy thought to himself...

74
00:07:26,292 --> 00:07:29,456
So that bird is a stand user, same as me.

75
00:07:30,103 --> 00:07:34,510
Given that it offed that guy with a giant
block of ice, it must be the guard around here.

76
00:07:35,048 --> 00:07:37,627
It'll kill anyone who approaches the mansion,

77
00:07:38,118 --> 00:07:41,088
which means that bird's next target

78
00:07:41,739 --> 00:07:43,601
is probably gonna be me.

79
00:07:50,109 --> 00:07:54,671
From early on, the ancient Egyptians
recognized the prowess of the noble falcon

80
00:07:54,711 --> 00:07:56,904
soaring high above the Nile valley.

81
00:07:57,057 --> 00:08:01,167
They trained the bird as a hunting partner
and considered it a symbol of Horus,

82
00:08:01,208 --> 00:08:03,340
guardian deity of the royal family.

83
00:08:04,697 --> 00:08:08,811
The falcon's vision is able to spot
prey from several kilometers away.

84
00:08:09,048 --> 00:08:12,246
Its oculus is forever represented by the eye of Horus,

85
00:08:12,278 --> 00:08:14,888
an emblem of protection and royal power.

86
00:08:15,943 --> 00:08:18,890
The falcon soaring through the air is called Pet Shop.

87
00:08:19,159 --> 00:08:22,830
It is the wielder of the stand Horus, god of the sky.

88
00:08:24,017 --> 00:08:25,607
Nervously, Iggy thought...

89
00:08:25,752 --> 00:08:26,548
Damn it.

90
00:08:26,686 --> 00:08:28,166
This is just my luck.

91
00:08:28,448 --> 00:08:30,472
Looks like I stumbled on Dio's mansion.

92
00:08:30,932 --> 00:08:34,005
Why'd I have to find this place
instead of one of the others?

93
00:08:34,707 --> 00:08:39,030
What's worse, that falcon can use
its stand to shoot giant chunks of ice.

94
00:08:39,339 --> 00:08:41,020
It's like a superpowered guard do...

95
00:08:41,649 --> 00:08:43,500
Actually, it's more like a guard bird.

96
00:08:53,159 --> 00:08:55,276
Come on. You gotta be kidding me.

97
00:08:55,328 --> 00:08:57,565
I couldn't care less about this Dio guy.

98
00:08:58,697 --> 00:09:04,265
I got dragged here against my will like some
pet and forced to be one of the Joestars' allies.

99
00:09:04,384 --> 00:09:06,111
Like hell, I'm gonna fight this thing.

100
00:09:06,851 --> 00:09:08,528
All I want is a little r & r,

101
00:09:08,569 --> 00:09:11,112
a girl of my own, some place to settle down.

102
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:14,406
Fighting someone else's battle
isn't on my list of things to do.

103
00:09:14,972 --> 00:09:18,520
Besides, even if I were to
throw down with tweety over there,

104
00:09:18,678 --> 00:09:19,986
what would I get in return?

105
00:09:20,178 --> 00:09:22,286
There's no way I'm putting my life on the line.

106
00:09:22,813 --> 00:09:25,237
Time to bring out that old "dumb dog" routine.

107
00:09:25,262 --> 00:09:27,736
That birdbrain will never suspect I'm with those guys.

108
00:09:55,395 --> 00:09:56,353
Those eyes.

109
00:09:56,702 --> 00:09:59,584
That's the thing about birds. You
can never tell what they're thinking!

110
00:10:00,714 --> 00:10:02,513
I bet my stand could take him,

111
00:10:02,825 --> 00:10:05,613
but then again, there's a reason
I'm making a fool out of myself here.

112
00:10:05,926 --> 00:10:08,911
I've got nothin' to do with Jotaro and those other guys.

113
00:10:08,995 --> 00:10:11,193
Go back to your mansion, you feathered freak.

114
00:10:17,317 --> 00:10:18,674
Huh? A bird?

115
00:10:21,234 --> 00:10:23,071
W-What's with this bird?

116
00:10:23,424 --> 00:10:25,504
Why isn't the damn thing moving?!

117
00:10:25,571 --> 00:10:28,083
No, it's too late. I'm gonna run it over!

118
00:10:38,965 --> 00:10:41,735
I've never seen anything like that bird in my life.

119
00:10:42,103 --> 00:10:44,960
How could it fly under a car so low to the ground?

120
00:10:45,562 --> 00:10:47,717
It didn't even try to dodge out of the way.

121
00:10:47,795 --> 00:10:49,996
It dove without giving it a second thought.

122
00:10:52,649 --> 00:10:53,962
Crazy bastard,

123
00:10:54,447 --> 00:10:57,783
but it seems like the freak's lost interest in me for now.

124
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,161
Apparently,

125
00:11:00,306 --> 00:11:04,079
it only goes on the offensive when people
try to make their way inside the mansion.

126
00:11:04,671 --> 00:11:08,841
Even so, if Jotaro and the others
ever end up finding this place,

127
00:11:09,117 --> 00:11:11,296
they'll have a hell of a time trying to get in.

128
00:11:12,598 --> 00:11:13,184
Oh, well.

129
00:11:13,434 --> 00:11:14,971
That's their problem to deal with.

130
00:11:15,462 --> 00:11:17,397
Buch! Tiny!

131
00:11:17,769 --> 00:11:20,570
Buch! Tiny! Where'd you guys go?!

132
00:11:22,362 --> 00:11:25,329
Hey, you haven't seen my dogs around, have you?

133
00:11:25,844 --> 00:11:28,264
Their names are Buch and Tiny if that helps at all.

134
00:11:28,501 --> 00:11:30,621
Get the hell out of my face.

135
00:11:30,695 --> 00:11:32,078
I'm a dog, pal.

136
00:11:32,289 --> 00:11:34,539
Even if I knew, it's not like I could answer.

137
00:11:34,729 --> 00:11:36,077
What are you, stupid?

138
00:11:39,612 --> 00:11:42,517
Oh, no! That collar looks like...

139
00:11:42,817 --> 00:11:44,777
I was right. It's Tiny's!

140
00:11:45,075 --> 00:11:47,782
I don't understand. Why's it under this gate?

141
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:49,923
And why is there blood on it?

142
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:51,457
Tiny and Buch?

143
00:11:51,624 --> 00:11:53,677
Is he talking about those big dogs?

144
00:11:54,327 --> 00:11:56,078
Tiny! Buch!

145
00:11:56,811 --> 00:11:58,004
What's that kid thinking?

146
00:11:58,184 --> 00:12:01,409
If he tries going under the gate,
he'll have to face the wrath of that bird.

147
00:12:01,634 --> 00:12:02,796
It'll murder him!

148
00:12:03,108 --> 00:12:05,682
Tiny! Buch! Are you there?

149
00:12:06,518 --> 00:12:08,499
Tiny! Buch!

150
00:12:11,087 --> 00:12:13,380
Tiny! Buch!

151
00:12:13,886 --> 00:12:15,700
Don't know why I'm getting so worked up.

152
00:12:16,172 --> 00:12:17,972
If some human kid bites the big one,

153
00:12:18,179 --> 00:12:19,493
it's not my problem.

154
00:12:19,992 --> 00:12:22,030
Survival of the fittest, as they say.

155
00:12:22,389 --> 00:12:25,824
The stupid die first... as do people who act recklessly.

156
00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:30,212
I'd rather stay out of this, so goodbye, kid.

157
00:12:31,524 --> 00:12:34,157
Tiny, Buch, come out! This isn't funny!

158
00:12:34,193 --> 00:12:35,869
I'm here to take you home!

159
00:12:50,005 --> 00:12:53,333
Holy sh-shit!

160
00:13:17,944 --> 00:13:19,188
Good grief.

161
00:13:19,719 --> 00:13:22,352
I have a soft spot for kid dog-lovers.

162
00:13:22,947 --> 00:13:23,929
Lucky for him.

163
00:13:34,041 --> 00:13:35,838
Tiny! Buch!

164
00:13:49,614 --> 00:13:51,327
I didn't wanna get involved, but...

165
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:53,955
It's up to me now!

166
00:14:00,842 --> 00:14:02,948
He had finally revealed his stand,

167
00:14:03,037 --> 00:14:07,609
confirming Pet Shop's suspicions about
Iggy's extraordinary canine abilities.

168
00:14:08,066 --> 00:14:09,437
Bring it, feather boy.

169
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:11,726
I can't wait to rip you to shreds.

170
00:14:13,463 --> 00:14:18,568
The falcon is known for its ability to
dive at speeds of over 300 kilometers per hour,

171
00:14:18,733 --> 00:14:21,169
making it the fastest animal on the planet.

172
00:14:21,545 --> 00:14:23,308
Even at its trademark speed,

173
00:14:23,357 --> 00:14:26,561
the falcon can spot its quarry with pinpoint accuracy.

174
00:14:26,861 --> 00:14:28,343
The prey, once discovered,

175
00:14:28,429 --> 00:14:31,813
faces a violent death by way of razor-sharp talons.

176
00:14:38,579 --> 00:14:39,070
Huh?

177
00:14:39,674 --> 00:14:42,243
What the... Did he just smirk at me?

178
00:14:42,972 --> 00:14:45,754
I could have sworn I saw the corners of its beak creep up.

179
00:14:46,006 --> 00:14:49,083
But birds can't smile, can they?

180
00:14:50,625 --> 00:14:53,391
Wait. What's going on here?

181
00:14:54,173 --> 00:14:56,493
The air, it's getting colder.

182
00:14:57,799 --> 00:14:58,277
Huh?

183
00:15:00,328 --> 00:15:02,482
Hmm! Ice is coming out of the ground!

184
00:15:02,596 --> 00:15:03,797
I'm such an idiot!

185
00:15:04,019 --> 00:15:07,567
I was so focused on the bird, I
didn't realize my feet were frozen over!

186
00:15:07,815 --> 00:15:09,595
My stand's feet froze, too!

187
00:15:12,231 --> 00:15:12,838
Shit.

188
00:15:14,708 --> 00:15:15,851
Icicles?!

189
00:15:45,351 --> 00:15:47,424
Come on. Give it to me straight, Avdol.

190
00:15:47,508 --> 00:15:51,570
Do you honestly believe that guy has
any chance of finding Dio's mansion?

191
00:15:51,599 --> 00:15:52,939
I certainly hope so,

192
00:15:52,963 --> 00:15:56,297
because if he can't find it, there's
no one left in this city who can.

193
00:15:56,651 --> 00:16:00,096
No one knows Cairo's complex
maze of streets better than him.

194
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,722
Try and have some faith.

195
00:16:01,755 --> 00:16:04,097
Faith is something I'm quickly running out of.

196
00:16:04,184 --> 00:16:07,876
We've been looking around this
godforsaken city for three days with no luck.

197
00:16:07,903 --> 00:16:11,286
I highly doubt some beggar will
find the mansion in three hours.

198
00:16:11,406 --> 00:16:13,894
You're starting to sound like a broken record, Polnareff.

199
00:16:13,919 --> 00:16:16,011
You could at least try to keep a level head.

200
00:16:16,069 --> 00:16:18,244
Listen up. We're all on edge right now.

201
00:16:18,353 --> 00:16:22,101
Until our friend gets back, all we
can do is try talking to the locals.

202
00:16:22,277 --> 00:16:23,524
Oh, brother.

203
00:16:23,685 --> 00:16:26,566
And to make matters worse, we haven't seen Iggy all day.

204
00:16:26,775 --> 00:16:29,197
Where the hell did that stupid mutt run off to?

205
00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:30,811
He better not be lost.

206
00:16:30,836 --> 00:16:34,183
For as long as I've known him,
Iggy's always been somewhat of a loner,

207
00:16:34,208 --> 00:16:36,623
so I'm sure he's just wandering around somewhere,

208
00:16:36,671 --> 00:16:38,656
killing time before coming back home.

209
00:16:39,671 --> 00:16:43,582
I used to think all dogs lit up and
wagged their tails when they saw humans.

210
00:16:43,725 --> 00:16:46,102
How'd we get stuck with that little cynic?

211
00:16:51,699 --> 00:16:53,973
I managed to get away from it somehow.

212
00:16:56,231 --> 00:16:59,372
Its stand's ice attack took the skin right off my paws.

213
00:17:00,431 --> 00:17:01,092
Damn it.

214
00:17:01,275 --> 00:17:03,978
I knew I should have let that
human kid fix his own problems.

215
00:17:04,417 --> 00:17:06,647
Its stand's power is nothing to sneeze at.

216
00:17:06,775 --> 00:17:08,471
That was no ordinary ice,

217
00:17:09,464 --> 00:17:11,666
and I bet he still has a few tricks.

218
00:17:12,787 --> 00:17:15,362
I'd better get out of here while the getting's good.

219
00:17:35,845 --> 00:17:37,612
Talk about holding a grudge.

220
00:17:58,458 --> 00:17:59,865
Iggy disappeared,

221
00:18:00,261 --> 00:18:02,282
but where could he have gone?

222
00:18:07,807 --> 00:18:09,724
Damn it. That hurt.

223
00:18:11,210 --> 00:18:13,210
The bastard doesn't hold anything back.

224
00:18:13,827 --> 00:18:16,758
He's strong for a dumb bird.

225
00:18:18,372 --> 00:18:20,790
This place reeks, but it'll have to do for now.

226
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:24,931
I have to keep quiet and hide
out down here until he gives up.

227
00:18:28,339 --> 00:18:31,173
What is this freaky bird's deal?!

228
00:18:49,289 --> 00:18:49,754
Hey!

229
00:18:53,574 --> 00:18:54,834
Surprise!

230
00:18:55,391 --> 00:18:56,777
Thought you had me, didn't you?

231
00:18:56,950 --> 00:19:00,258
But what you "killed" was my
shape-shifting stand, The Fool!

232
00:19:04,763 --> 00:19:08,243
Yeah! How do you like them apples, featherbrain?

233
00:19:15,044 --> 00:19:16,450
Might wanna keep still.

234
00:19:16,731 --> 00:19:18,706
Looks like you're losing a lot of blood there.

235
00:19:18,986 --> 00:19:20,934
But before this drags out any further,

236
00:19:20,987 --> 00:19:25,247
you should probably know I don't give a
rat's ass about you or your master Dio.

237
00:19:25,686 --> 00:19:27,843
What do you say we call this a draw?

238
00:19:28,262 --> 00:19:32,333
You got a few good hits in with those
ice missiles, so we're even, right?

239
00:19:36,758 --> 00:19:38,633
W-What the hell was that?

240
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:40,954
Who does this guy think he is, Bruce Lee?

241
00:19:41,472 --> 00:19:45,469
Hey, can't you hear?! I said I'll
stay away from your boss's mansion!

242
00:19:45,676 --> 00:19:47,588
Let's stop this, okay?

243
00:19:48,372 --> 00:19:49,052
Huh?

244
00:20:09,930 --> 00:20:11,610
That's what your stand looks like?

245
00:20:12,192 --> 00:20:13,843
What am I gonna do now?

246
00:20:19,514 --> 00:20:22,156
You stopped your wound from bleeding by freezing it?

247
00:20:22,236 --> 00:20:23,202
What the hell?!

248
00:20:24,394 --> 00:20:25,446
Blast it!

249
00:20:25,770 --> 00:20:27,997
Oh, no! The exit's blocked with ice,

250
00:20:28,096 --> 00:20:30,125
and more's coming this way!

251
00:20:31,832 --> 00:20:32,491
Shit!

252
00:20:34,555 --> 00:20:36,417
It's starting to cover the whole tunnel.

253
00:20:37,105 --> 00:20:39,304
I gotta find a way out of this deathtrap!

254
00:20:52,345 --> 00:20:54,640
No way! It blocked off this exit, too!

255
00:21:07,133 --> 00:21:09,310
Crap. It's got me in its crosshairs.

256
00:21:09,439 --> 00:21:10,890
This bird's insane!

257
00:21:11,492 --> 00:21:13,318
This is more than sheer determination.

258
00:21:13,482 --> 00:21:15,685
This creep's a frickin' killing machine,

259
00:21:15,996 --> 00:21:18,120
and if it catches me, it won't just kill me.

260
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:20,072
It'll eat me alive!

261
00:21:30,051 --> 00:21:30,684
What?!

262
00:21:32,854 --> 00:21:33,822
My paw!

263
00:21:35,792 --> 00:21:37,892
I can't pry my paw loose!
