1
00:00:00,773 --> 00:00:04,126
Jotaro, do you hear what you're saying right now?

2
00:00:06,602 --> 00:00:07,802
Of course I do.

3
00:00:08,414 --> 00:00:11,022
Finally starting to lose your hearing, old man?

4
00:00:11,758 --> 00:00:14,157
Obviously I just told him my next pitch.

5
00:00:14,810 --> 00:00:17,725
I'm gonna win with a high, outside fastball.

6
00:00:17,966 --> 00:00:20,417
Bu... But, Jotaro, you...

7
00:00:21,468 --> 00:00:22,679
Will you believe me,

8
00:00:23,272 --> 00:00:25,209
or will you doubt me instead?

9
00:00:26,993 --> 00:00:29,095
Not too bright, are you?

10
00:00:36,157 --> 00:00:41,593
My stand peers into your soul the same way a
thermal imager detects an object's radiation.

11
00:00:41,781 --> 00:00:44,593
Say what you will, your soul cannot lie.

12
00:00:44,898 --> 00:00:50,913
Regardless of what it is, by analyzing your
soul, I can see the answer to any yes-or-no question.

13
00:00:51,017 --> 00:00:53,294
Right or left? High or low?

14
00:00:53,319 --> 00:00:56,705
Outside or inside? Fastball or curveball?

15
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:59,275
My stand's perception is infallible.

16
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:34,959
Will your pitch be a high, outside fastball?

17
00:02:36,257 --> 00:02:37,550
Yes or no?

18
00:02:38,161 --> 00:02:41,200
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!

19
00:02:41,306 --> 00:02:43,952
Well, Jotaro's telling the truth, after all.

20
00:02:44,226 --> 00:02:47,310
He's really going to pitch a high, outside fastball.

21
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:48,956
What's he up to?

22
00:02:49,191 --> 00:02:51,437
It's true that he beat my brother by bluffing,

23
00:02:51,462 --> 00:02:55,293
but he's a fool if he thinks the
same, tired tactic will work with me.

24
00:02:55,955 --> 00:02:56,924
Here it comes.

25
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:07,083
For your sake, I hope you haven't forgotten that
you'll lose the game if you fall 11 runs behind.

26
00:03:11,756 --> 00:03:13,748
Was that a curve?

27
00:03:13,775 --> 00:03:14,893
Impossible.

28
00:03:15,022 --> 00:03:17,671
I thought he was going for a high, outside fastball.

29
00:03:17,696 --> 00:03:18,356
Eh?

30
00:03:19,524 --> 00:03:21,279
He hits, but it's a grounder.

31
00:03:21,352 --> 00:03:23,906
The ball is thrown to first, and out.

32
00:03:32,009 --> 00:03:33,757
T-there's just no way.

33
00:03:33,962 --> 00:03:37,264
Everything about him said he was
going to throw a high, outside fastball.

34
00:03:38,052 --> 00:03:41,969
His soul can't lie. No one's can, not a zen master,

35
00:03:42,002 --> 00:03:45,457
not even my brother, and he's
the world's greatest con man.

36
00:03:45,537 --> 00:03:48,296
Next up is another high, outside fastball.

37
00:03:49,927 --> 00:03:51,848
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!

38
00:03:52,779 --> 00:03:53,706
What the hell?

39
00:03:53,902 --> 00:03:55,146
He's telling the truth.

40
00:03:55,925 --> 00:03:59,185
Jotaro, you have the gall to cheat your way to victory?

41
00:03:59,238 --> 00:04:02,146
I do! I do! I do! I do! I do!

42
00:04:02,246 --> 00:04:04,905
What? He actually is cheating.

43
00:04:07,675 --> 00:04:09,348
A low, inside forkball.

44
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:13,138
It's a fly ball heading for the pitcher.

45
00:04:13,358 --> 00:04:13,885
Out.

46
00:04:14,898 --> 00:04:17,110
You must have cheated. Admit it!

47
00:04:17,269 --> 00:04:20,009
You bastard. You clearly tampered with the console.

48
00:04:20,041 --> 00:04:22,835
No! No! No! No! No! No!

49
00:04:22,909 --> 00:04:23,398
Wha...

50
00:04:23,722 --> 00:04:25,039
He's telling the truth?

51
00:04:30,804 --> 00:04:32,908
I know you're cheating me. You have to be.

52
00:04:33,172 --> 00:04:35,005
Would you just come clean already?

53
00:04:38,993 --> 00:04:40,108
No response.

54
00:04:40,364 --> 00:04:41,858
Damn it, that's right.

55
00:04:41,972 --> 00:04:45,353
I only have use of my power if
I ask him a yes-or-no question.

56
00:04:46,095 --> 00:04:47,988
Judging from your scared expression,

57
00:04:48,117 --> 00:04:50,572
your power requires a yes-or-no question.

58
00:04:51,762 --> 00:04:53,554
It's like your brother used to say.

59
00:04:53,859 --> 00:04:57,359
This is just a dance of deception
where the loser cries first.

60
00:04:57,712 --> 00:05:01,258
A dance, eh? So this is nothing but a game to you?

61
00:05:02,742 --> 00:05:04,435
How dare you?

62
00:05:04,505 --> 00:05:06,323
Are you taking me for a fool?

63
00:05:06,796 --> 00:05:08,813
Have you any idea who you're speaking to?

64
00:05:08,936 --> 00:05:11,164
Jotaro, pitch the ball!

65
00:05:11,433 --> 00:05:15,278
I'll figure out your little trick
and take your soul as my prize!

66
00:05:16,626 --> 00:05:19,088
All right, let's continue.

67
00:05:19,467 --> 00:05:23,000
For my next pitch, I'll throw a high, outside fastball.

68
00:05:26,021 --> 00:05:28,487
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!

69
00:05:29,037 --> 00:05:31,524
Once again, his soul says he's telling the truth.

70
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:34,772
He's really going to pitch a high, outside fastball.

71
00:05:35,384 --> 00:05:39,144
I've had about as much of this
as I can take. This ends now.

72
00:05:39,212 --> 00:05:42,311
I'll figure out how you're
cheating if it's the last thing I do.

73
00:05:45,357 --> 00:05:47,768
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!

74
00:05:47,949 --> 00:05:50,008
So Jotaro hasn't changed his mind.

75
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:52,829
He's still dead set on throwing that infernal pitch.

76
00:05:53,602 --> 00:05:54,544
It's coming.

77
00:05:54,601 --> 00:05:56,275
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!

78
00:05:56,349 --> 00:05:59,143
So far, it's still a fastball,
and his soul is saying, "Yes."

79
00:06:00,564 --> 00:06:03,781
It changed direction! A forkball!

80
00:06:03,852 --> 00:06:06,804
What?! It's a different pitch now!

81
00:06:06,841 --> 00:06:08,013
Yes! Yes! Yes!

82
00:06:09,691 --> 00:06:12,608
Out. That's three outs. Change.

83
00:06:16,908 --> 00:06:17,799
I don't get it.

84
00:06:18,073 --> 00:06:20,470
Why can't I figure out how he's cheating?

85
00:06:20,942 --> 00:06:23,385
Jotaro's soul kept saying he'd throw a fastball,

86
00:06:23,525 --> 00:06:26,223
but at the last second, it curved into a forkball.

87
00:06:26,927 --> 00:06:29,431
Th-this doesn't make any sense!

88
00:06:29,918 --> 00:06:33,206
How? How is this wretch deceiving me?!

89
00:06:35,696 --> 00:06:38,220
You're gonna lose this game, Darby.

90
00:06:38,527 --> 00:06:39,722
Shut your mouth!

91
00:06:40,068 --> 00:06:43,000
Come on. Tell me why you removed your stupid hat!

92
00:06:43,398 --> 00:06:45,100
I'm more perceptive than you think.

93
00:06:45,153 --> 00:06:47,499
I know you've been cheating ever since you took it off.

94
00:06:47,655 --> 00:06:50,420
Now move. I want to check your station and controller.

95
00:06:57,527 --> 00:06:58,649
There's nothing here.

96
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:01,462
Damn you! How did you do it?!

97
00:07:01,643 --> 00:07:04,195
It must have something to do with that hat of yours.

98
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:05,416
Isn't that right?

99
00:07:05,454 --> 00:07:07,340
No! No! No! No!

100
00:07:09,865 --> 00:07:12,178
There must be evidence around here somewhere.

101
00:07:12,219 --> 00:07:13,973
No! No! No! No!

102
00:07:13,998 --> 00:07:14,645
I get it.

103
00:07:14,676 --> 00:07:16,746
You're using star platinum to cheat, aren't you?

104
00:07:16,771 --> 00:07:18,632
No! No! No! No!

105
00:07:18,958 --> 00:07:21,476
Just admit it! You're doing something!

106
00:07:21,529 --> 00:07:23,965
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!

107
00:07:24,808 --> 00:07:25,553
Damn it.

108
00:07:25,881 --> 00:07:28,754
Damn it! I can clearly read Jotaro's thoughts,

109
00:07:28,847 --> 00:07:31,986
which means my stand's power
is still working as it should,

110
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:35,423
so how can his mind say one
thing, but his body do another?

111
00:07:35,448 --> 00:07:37,520
Hey, Jotaro, are you seeing this?

112
00:07:37,545 --> 00:07:39,680
Looks like he's losing his youthful glow.

113
00:07:39,962 --> 00:07:42,925
He definitely doesn't look like
a guy in his twenties anymore.

114
00:07:43,198 --> 00:07:46,215
Darby, it's your turn to pitch, so hurry.

115
00:07:46,328 --> 00:07:47,301
We don't have all day.

116
00:07:47,326 --> 00:07:48,321
It's four to three.

117
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:51,660
With only a one-point difference,
I might still have a chance.

118
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:55,103
I am a video game genius. I can't lose.

119
00:07:55,137 --> 00:07:57,006
I am a video game genius.

120
00:07:57,039 --> 00:07:58,385
I can't lose!

121
00:07:58,452 --> 00:08:00,389
I've won every game I've ever played.

122
00:08:00,503 --> 00:08:01,766
I'm invincible.

123
00:08:01,944 --> 00:08:04,132
A video game expert is an expert at life.

124
00:08:04,419 --> 00:08:07,422
Do you think you can shake my confidence so easily?

125
00:08:11,159 --> 00:08:12,940
Look at that. Another home run.

126
00:08:12,971 --> 00:08:15,140
That's another run for the Jaguars, folks.

127
00:08:15,575 --> 00:08:16,975
It's five to three.

128
00:08:23,579 --> 00:08:24,126
Eh?

129
00:08:27,545 --> 00:08:29,438
I-it can't be.

130
00:08:29,627 --> 00:08:32,513
I accidentally released his soul from the doll!

131
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:35,274
Look! His soul has returned to his body.

132
00:08:35,434 --> 00:08:37,184
He's regaining consciousness.

133
00:08:39,550 --> 00:08:40,883
N-no. I didn't.

134
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:42,708
I never once admitted defeat.

135
00:08:42,881 --> 00:08:44,080
It was an accident.

136
00:08:44,154 --> 00:08:46,709
I didn't mean to release his soul from the doll.

137
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:49,281
But the thing is you did release his soul.

138
00:08:49,905 --> 00:08:51,230
You know what that means.

139
00:08:52,288 --> 00:08:54,902
Your soul admitted defeat, and it's game over.

140
00:08:57,413 --> 00:08:58,803
Huh? Hold on.

141
00:08:58,975 --> 00:09:01,085
This is Joseph's stand?

142
00:09:01,558 --> 00:09:04,443
It was wrapped around the controller the entire time.

143
00:09:04,468 --> 00:09:07,543
Huh? Whoops. I guess I forgot to put this away.

144
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:10,319
How could something so stupid...

145
00:09:10,433 --> 00:09:12,330
No. You mean it was Joseph?

146
00:09:12,476 --> 00:09:14,300
He was the cheater all along?

147
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:16,789
Damn it. Jotaro was telling the truth.

148
00:09:17,106 --> 00:09:18,877
He really wasn't controlling it.

149
00:09:19,516 --> 00:09:21,470
It was you, Joseph Joestar!

150
00:09:21,557 --> 00:09:22,338
Hmm?

151
00:09:23,713 --> 00:09:25,904
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!

152
00:09:26,023 --> 00:09:27,310
That's right. Good boy.

153
00:09:27,537 --> 00:09:29,835
Too bad you're not your brother, 'cause if you were,

154
00:09:30,075 --> 00:09:32,199
you would have figured it out a long time ago.

155
00:09:37,091 --> 00:09:39,837
By the way, old man, you're pretty clever.

156
00:09:39,873 --> 00:09:43,078
I didn't expect you to catch on
to my idea as quickly as you did.

157
00:09:43,119 --> 00:09:46,073
Well, of course I did, my boy. I can read you like a book.

158
00:09:46,511 --> 00:09:48,357
You are my grandson, after all.

159
00:09:49,541 --> 00:09:51,248
Now up and at 'em, Kakyoin.

160
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,065
Damn.

161
00:09:53,495 --> 00:09:55,795
Joseph was controlling things from behind.

162
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:57,399
Before I forget...

163
00:09:58,482 --> 00:10:01,092
What to do with you, you button-mashing jerk?

164
00:10:01,125 --> 00:10:01,849
Oh, shit!

165
00:10:02,058 --> 00:10:03,602
Please, mercy! I beg you!

166
00:10:03,721 --> 00:10:06,210
I've already given you back Kakyoin's soul, haven't I?

167
00:10:06,242 --> 00:10:08,584
It's like they say, "no harm, no foul."

168
00:10:08,651 --> 00:10:11,077
We're good. Right? Right? Right?

169
00:10:11,198 --> 00:10:13,037
You wanna know whether I'll forgive you?

170
00:10:13,376 --> 00:10:16,211
Why don't you just do what you do best and read my mind?

171
00:10:17,594 --> 00:10:19,997
No! No! No! No! No!

172
00:10:21,812 --> 00:10:26,235
Answer this. Will I hit you with my right
fist or decide to deck you with my left?

173
00:10:26,381 --> 00:10:27,368
I'd love to know.

174
00:10:27,688 --> 00:10:30,834
Well, since you're asking, you'll use your right one?

175
00:10:30,967 --> 00:10:33,589
No! No! No! No! No!

176
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:35,630
Then your left?

177
00:10:35,943 --> 00:10:38,511
No! No! No! No! No!

178
00:10:38,915 --> 00:10:41,075
You're not gonna use both, are you?

179
00:10:41,661 --> 00:10:43,896
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!

180
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:45,547
Yes!

181
00:10:45,609 --> 00:10:47,893
Are you gonna do the "Ora! Ora!" thing?!

182
00:10:47,991 --> 00:10:51,685
Yes, yes, yes! Oh, my god.

183
00:10:56,466 --> 00:10:59,034
Darby younger, out of commission.

184
00:10:59,059 --> 00:11:00,383
Ora!

185
00:11:04,921 --> 00:11:05,812
How about that?

186
00:11:05,902 --> 00:11:07,570
We broke through some sort of wall.

187
00:11:07,744 --> 00:11:09,287
That's our ticket out of here.

188
00:11:09,432 --> 00:11:11,181
Jotaro. Kakyoin.

189
00:11:11,934 --> 00:11:13,267
Good grief.

190
00:11:21,917 --> 00:11:24,075
Forgive me for disturbing you,

191
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:27,892
but, your excellence, as I'm sure you're aware,

192
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:31,571
Joestar and his comrades have just infiltrated the manor.

193
00:11:31,921 --> 00:11:36,429
Regrettably, I must also inform
you that Darby has been defeated.

194
00:11:40,819 --> 00:11:43,654
Oh? But Darby was a genius.

195
00:11:43,887 --> 00:11:46,649
How could one as gifted as Darby fail me?

196
00:11:46,689 --> 00:11:49,290
Come. I'd like to hear your thoughts.

197
00:11:49,921 --> 00:11:53,001
You may enter, Cool Ice.

198
00:12:04,288 --> 00:12:05,696
As you wish.

199
00:12:11,284 --> 00:12:13,206
Always remember this.

200
00:12:13,433 --> 00:12:16,667
Whatever the obstacle, whatever the danger,

201
00:12:16,939 --> 00:12:22,126
the Joestars are prepared to sacrifice
their lives in order to save their family.

202
00:12:22,424 --> 00:12:24,407
Kakyoin and the other two...

203
00:12:24,868 --> 00:12:26,278
What were their names again?

204
00:12:26,676 --> 00:12:30,813
Ah, yes, I believe it's Avdol and Polnareff.

205
00:12:31,126 --> 00:12:35,586
They're willing to surrender their
lives for the eradication of yours truly.

206
00:12:36,615 --> 00:12:41,665
They believe fleeing from me is somehow
the same as running from themselves.

207
00:12:42,266 --> 00:12:44,326
Fools, one and all.

208
00:12:44,788 --> 00:12:45,912
Nonetheless,

209
00:12:45,983 --> 00:12:49,533
the fools find strength in this misguided belief.

210
00:12:49,833 --> 00:12:52,596
Darby swore his undying loyalty,

211
00:12:53,008 --> 00:12:57,600
but unfortunately he was not
prepared to actually die on my behalf,

212
00:12:58,368 --> 00:13:02,971
which is why, at the edge of glory,
victory slipped through his fingers.

213
00:13:03,597 --> 00:13:08,143
For the rest of eternity, Darby will remain in ignorance.

214
00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:09,994
Ice...

215
00:13:10,632 --> 00:13:12,935
have a look at the scar on my neck.

216
00:13:15,223 --> 00:13:18,187
Jonathan Joestar's body is still rejecting me,

217
00:13:18,247 --> 00:13:22,504
but I need the blood of one more soul
before this body truly becomes mine,

218
00:13:22,652 --> 00:13:25,247
and once that happens, the wound will heal.

219
00:13:26,374 --> 00:13:31,336
Ice, will you offer me the crimson
vigor coursing through your veins?

220
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,669
Yes. It'd be an honor.

221
00:13:47,527 --> 00:13:49,173
What is mine is yours.

222
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:12,551
Ah, you beheaded yourself.

223
00:14:12,785 --> 00:14:14,402
Most splendid.

224
00:14:14,431 --> 00:14:15,641
But, Cool Ice,

225
00:14:15,845 --> 00:14:19,070
I cannot accept the blood of such a loyal servant.

226
00:14:19,516 --> 00:14:21,253
My wound shall be healed,

227
00:14:21,305 --> 00:14:23,628
but it will be with the blood of another.

228
00:14:24,481 --> 00:14:26,576
For now, you must live,

229
00:14:26,915 --> 00:14:29,501
so awaken, and be reborn.

230
00:14:30,088 --> 00:14:32,047
Your steadfast resolve

231
00:14:32,093 --> 00:14:35,318
shall secure your victory over those who'd oppose me.

232
00:14:39,274 --> 00:14:42,298
I shall not fail you, my lord.

233
00:14:42,539 --> 00:14:45,379
No weapon can surpass one's own body.

234
00:14:45,588 --> 00:14:47,547
You are ready, Cool Ice.

235
00:14:47,859 --> 00:14:51,004
Now go, and attend to our unwanted guests.

236
00:14:52,856 --> 00:14:54,394
I swear, lord Dio,

237
00:14:55,067 --> 00:14:56,884
I will not let you down.

238
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:01,738
You have my word. I'll destroy them all.

239
00:15:18,619 --> 00:15:21,149
Well, I sincerely hope that for your sake,

240
00:15:21,251 --> 00:15:26,013
your next victim into the void will be
one of the Joestars and not my boudoir.

241
00:15:34,841 --> 00:15:36,573
The ten minutes he gave us are up.

242
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:40,159
I know that Mr. Joestar ordered
us to set the mansion on fire,

243
00:15:40,432 --> 00:15:43,000
but I say we go. We have to find them.

244
00:15:43,068 --> 00:15:43,934
Agreed.

245
00:15:45,098 --> 00:15:48,752
Polnareff, before we proceed,
there's something I need to tell you.

246
00:15:49,479 --> 00:15:50,355
Listen well.

247
00:15:50,833 --> 00:15:54,983
If you lose your way, get injured, or
can't go on, I won't come to your rescue.

248
00:15:55,630 --> 00:15:57,270
Make sure you understand that.

249
00:15:58,373 --> 00:15:59,602
Same for you, Iggy.

250
00:16:00,592 --> 00:16:02,225
I know that might sound cruel,

251
00:16:02,328 --> 00:16:05,845
but remember the reason we're here
is to defeat Dio once and for all.

252
00:16:06,171 --> 00:16:09,033
And of course the same rules must apply to me as well.

253
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:11,181
If I'm injured or separated from you,

254
00:16:11,223 --> 00:16:13,600
you have to promise you won't attempt to save me.

255
00:16:14,346 --> 00:16:17,437
Above all else, you must think of your own safety.

256
00:16:17,684 --> 00:16:20,631
We can't let ourselves get
killed trying to save one another.

257
00:16:20,816 --> 00:16:22,242
There's too much at stake.

258
00:16:24,404 --> 00:16:26,601
Oui. That's how it goes, then.

259
00:16:31,717 --> 00:16:35,196
If we get out of this alive, you're
treating me to one hell of a meal.

260
00:16:35,426 --> 00:16:36,942
I'll treat you both.

261
00:16:37,603 --> 00:16:39,048
All right, let's go.

262
00:16:41,433 --> 00:16:43,453
Do your thing, Silver Chariot!

263
00:17:08,073 --> 00:17:10,397
Hey, Avdol, what do we do now?

264
00:17:10,422 --> 00:17:12,457
This place looks like it goes on forever.

265
00:17:13,666 --> 00:17:16,957
I know Mr. Joestar told us to set the mansion on fire,

266
00:17:16,996 --> 00:17:22,453
but setting this immense labyrinth ablaze would
end up putting us all in danger, so instead...

267
00:17:22,641 --> 00:17:23,813
Magician's Red.

268
00:17:33,532 --> 00:17:35,700
These flames detect life-forms.

269
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:40,829
They can sense anything alive, detecting
even cutaneous respiration and minute movements.

270
00:17:41,314 --> 00:17:43,782
These flames can also sense a stand's energy,

271
00:17:43,849 --> 00:17:45,619
so we'll let them lead the way.

272
00:17:45,973 --> 00:17:48,434
Any particular reason there are six flames?

273
00:17:48,883 --> 00:17:52,293
There's one for each direction,
as well as for above and below.

274
00:17:52,871 --> 00:17:55,575
If there is anything hidden within 15 meters,

275
00:17:55,655 --> 00:18:00,031
regardless of its size, the flame will
detect its presence and alert us immediately.

276
00:18:01,384 --> 00:18:04,043
Mr. Joestar and the others were pulled below us.

277
00:18:04,177 --> 00:18:05,156
Let's head down.

278
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,035
The flames are picking up on something.

279
00:18:10,064 --> 00:18:12,018
Apparently it's in front of us to the left.

280
00:18:12,043 --> 00:18:12,733
What is?!

281
00:18:18,835 --> 00:18:19,915
The fool!

282
00:18:31,554 --> 00:18:32,544
What the hell?!

283
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:34,473
Who's this guy supposed to be?

284
00:18:35,403 --> 00:18:37,382
Look. Do you see what's happening, Polnareff?

285
00:18:37,457 --> 00:18:39,156
Huh? The maze,

286
00:18:39,258 --> 00:18:41,269
it's totally disappeared!

287
00:18:41,333 --> 00:18:45,529
I'm willing to bet the power of this
man's stand created the illusion of the maze.

288
00:18:45,578 --> 00:18:48,258
It dissipated as soon as Iggy slashed him.

289
00:18:49,436 --> 00:18:51,168
His name, Billie Jean.

290
00:18:51,203 --> 00:18:53,172
His fate, instant defeat.

291
00:18:53,814 --> 00:18:58,042
The mansion is back to normal now, so
we averted at least one potential crisis,

292
00:18:58,299 --> 00:19:01,154
and the flames don't seem to be sensing any danger.

293
00:19:01,479 --> 00:19:02,209
Hmm?

294
00:19:22,626 --> 00:19:24,372
The flames don't sense a thing,

295
00:19:24,618 --> 00:19:26,725
and Iggy hasn't picked up on anything either.

296
00:19:33,113 --> 00:19:36,720
My god, what is that abomination?

297
00:19:36,923 --> 00:19:40,663
Impossible! Neither my flames nor Iggy could sense it.

298
00:19:41,328 --> 00:19:42,704
Where did it come from?!

299
00:19:44,306 --> 00:19:47,074
Polnareff, Iggy, you have to get out of here now!

300
00:20:03,842 --> 00:20:05,979
Hey, where are you, Avdol?!

301
00:20:06,088 --> 00:20:06,868
The hell?

302
00:20:06,895 --> 00:20:09,618
W-What was that thing? Where did it...

303
00:20:13,981 --> 00:20:15,694
No, it can't be.

304
00:20:15,934 --> 00:20:16,958
Whose arms are...

305
00:20:17,376 --> 00:20:20,512
H-hey, Avdol, where did you go?!

306
00:20:20,986 --> 00:20:23,275
Avdol, where are you?!

307
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:25,404
Avdol!

308
00:20:26,211 --> 00:20:28,793
Come out, Avdol!

309
00:20:34,235 --> 00:20:36,781
W-What the hell is that thing?

310
00:20:37,141 --> 00:20:38,732
Where did it come from?!

311
00:20:39,307 --> 00:20:42,527
Weren't Avdol's flames supposed
to be able to sense anything?

312
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:46,256
Hey, Iggy, couldn't your nose pick up on this thing?!

313
00:20:46,570 --> 00:20:47,691
Answer me!

314
00:20:49,795 --> 00:20:51,848
Avdol, where are you?!

315
00:20:51,935 --> 00:20:53,448
Where the hell'd you go?!

316
00:20:55,214 --> 00:20:56,176
Avdol...

317
00:21:01,106 --> 00:21:03,582
Has been reduced to nothingness.

318
00:21:06,046 --> 00:21:08,641
Beyond my jaws lies an endless void,

319
00:21:08,694 --> 00:21:13,125
a dark dimension which harbors
things even I do not fully comprehend.

320
00:21:13,296 --> 00:21:17,360
Your ally is dead, but fret
not, as you will soon join him.

321
00:21:17,634 --> 00:21:20,813
You were arrogant enough to
believe you could defeat lord Dio,

322
00:21:21,079 --> 00:21:23,234
therefore you must be punished.

323
00:21:29,979 --> 00:21:31,219
One by one,

324
00:21:31,436 --> 00:21:33,356
each of you shall fall in line

325
00:21:33,809 --> 00:21:38,327
as I scatter your atomic fragments
across the deepest recesses of the void.

326
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,504
No, you're lying.

327
00:21:44,403 --> 00:21:45,677
It's impossible.

328
00:21:47,645 --> 00:21:49,693
There's no way you killed Avdol.

329
00:21:50,806 --> 00:21:53,492
How dare you lie to me?!
