1
00:00:23,095 --> 00:00:24,442
It's about time.

2
00:02:07,425 --> 00:02:07,825
Hmm?

3
00:02:07,985 --> 00:02:08,565
Hmm?

4
00:02:08,745 --> 00:02:11,164
Hey, do you hear that noise, too?

5
00:02:11,189 --> 00:02:12,385
They've arrived.

6
00:02:13,888 --> 00:02:15,216
It's a helicopter!

7
00:02:15,241 --> 00:02:17,207
Thanks for the update, captain obvious.

8
00:02:17,644 --> 00:02:21,257
They're here from the Speedwagon foundation,
and they're looking for somewhere to land.

9
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:23,512
Speedwagon foundation?

10
00:02:23,983 --> 00:02:27,709
Correct me if I'm wrong, but aren't they the
group that's looking after mom back in Japan?

11
00:02:27,734 --> 00:02:29,073
They're old friends of yours, right?

12
00:02:29,098 --> 00:02:30,706
Yep, that's them, all right.

13
00:02:32,084 --> 00:02:32,883
So, what?

14
00:02:33,292 --> 00:02:35,511
Are we taking a helicopter from here on out?

15
00:02:36,071 --> 00:02:36,923
Not quite.

16
00:02:36,947 --> 00:02:40,863
As much as I'd like to, the guys working
for the foundation aren't stand users,

17
00:02:40,887 --> 00:02:43,395
so we'd be putting them in
harm's way if we hitched a ride.

18
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:46,537
Well, if they're not here to give
us a ride, what's the occasion, then?

19
00:02:46,894 --> 00:02:48,901
They've brought us our new ally.

20
00:02:49,995 --> 00:02:52,269
Tu rigoles! An ally?

21
00:02:52,805 --> 00:02:55,088
I have to warn you, he's a bit of a handful,

22
00:02:55,218 --> 00:02:57,934
which is the primary reason it took so long to fetch him.

23
00:02:58,014 --> 00:02:59,369
Mr. Joestar!

24
00:02:59,501 --> 00:03:02,366
You aren't seriously considering
taking him with us, are you?

25
00:03:02,391 --> 00:03:04,206
His presence here would only hold us back.

26
00:03:04,231 --> 00:03:05,985
So he might actually harm us?

27
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:08,535
Correct, so be careful.

28
00:03:08,702 --> 00:03:09,983
Not so fast.

29
00:03:10,016 --> 00:03:13,476
This new ally of ours, are you
saying that he's a stand user, too?

30
00:03:13,869 --> 00:03:18,044
Yes, that's right, and his stand is
represented by the card known as the fool.

31
00:03:18,696 --> 00:03:19,525
The fool?

32
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,104
Wait. The fool?

33
00:03:24,831 --> 00:03:27,681
Sounds like a pretty stupid card if you want my opinion.

34
00:03:27,741 --> 00:03:30,464
You should count your blessings that he's on our side.

35
00:03:31,435 --> 00:03:32,888
You can't beat him.

36
00:03:33,812 --> 00:03:37,160
I'd suggest watching your mouth
if you know what's good for you, Avdol.

37
00:03:37,185 --> 00:03:38,633
It's true, Polnareff.

38
00:03:38,806 --> 00:03:40,793
Now move your hand. You're hurting me.

39
00:03:40,818 --> 00:03:42,348
Who died and made you the boss?!

40
00:03:42,373 --> 00:03:43,774
Enough, you two.

41
00:03:44,375 --> 00:03:45,658
The helicopter's here.

42
00:04:07,548 --> 00:04:09,805
Mr. Joestar. Good to see you.

43
00:04:10,091 --> 00:04:11,636
Thank you for bringing him here.

44
00:04:11,661 --> 00:04:12,705
Must have been rough.

45
00:04:12,991 --> 00:04:15,879
So which one of you is it?

46
00:04:15,904 --> 00:04:17,332
Who's the stand user?

47
00:04:17,357 --> 00:04:17,963
Hmm?

48
00:04:22,302 --> 00:04:24,295
Well, are you gonna answer me or not?

49
00:04:25,155 --> 00:04:26,071
Is it you?

50
00:04:26,096 --> 00:04:28,400
No, sir. Neither of us is the user.

51
00:04:28,753 --> 00:04:30,240
He's actually in the back.

52
00:04:35,087 --> 00:04:36,246
In the back, huh?

53
00:04:37,624 --> 00:04:39,077
I don't see anyone.

54
00:04:39,102 --> 00:04:40,489
No, he's there.

55
00:04:40,514 --> 00:04:42,724
Hey, hey, cut it out.

56
00:04:42,749 --> 00:04:44,964
Come on. Quit joking around.

57
00:04:45,064 --> 00:04:47,757
What's the deal? Is the guy really short or something?

58
00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:50,214
Come out, come out wherever you are!

59
00:04:50,253 --> 00:04:51,333
Hey, watch out!

60
00:04:52,833 --> 00:04:53,372
Huh?

61
00:04:53,672 --> 00:04:56,156
That's weird. What the hell is this stuff?

62
00:04:56,343 --> 00:04:57,617
Please, be careful!

63
00:04:57,689 --> 00:05:00,220
It was a rough copter ride, so he's in a foul mood!

64
00:05:00,245 --> 00:05:03,347
Step away! I've already told you this guy is trouble.

65
00:05:03,372 --> 00:05:06,060
Get back, Polnareff. You cannot beat him.

66
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:09,528
What's the big deal? All I'm doing is asking where he is.

67
00:05:09,627 --> 00:05:10,101
Huh?

68
00:05:14,066 --> 00:05:15,787
H-h-h-h-he's...

69
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:17,174
A dog.

70
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:19,045
Don't tell me this dog is...

71
00:05:19,112 --> 00:05:20,121
Mm-hmm.

72
00:05:21,138 --> 00:05:24,086
Yes, this dog possesses the stand of the fool.

73
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:28,658
His name is Iggy, and he's crazy about
ripping chunks of hair out of people's heads.

74
00:05:29,558 --> 00:05:32,059
To be honest with you, I'm not sure where he's from,

75
00:05:32,272 --> 00:05:36,119
but Avdol found him in New York after
none of the dogcatchers could wrangle him,

76
00:05:36,438 --> 00:05:39,426
and it's thanks to Avdol that
he's not roaming the streets now.

77
00:05:39,685 --> 00:05:42,313
Oh, there's something that I
probably should have mentioned.

78
00:05:42,394 --> 00:05:45,676
When he's in the middle of ripping
out someone's hair, he likes to, uh...

79
00:05:48,106 --> 00:05:49,668
Pass gas in their face.

80
00:05:49,693 --> 00:05:51,837
It's a disgusting habit, really.

81
00:05:56,854 --> 00:05:59,529
You little mutt! You're gonna pay for that!

82
00:05:59,902 --> 00:06:01,237
Damn you!

83
00:06:01,644 --> 00:06:03,252
Chariot!

84
00:06:22,245 --> 00:06:23,553
Holy cow!

85
00:06:23,578 --> 00:06:25,107
So that thing is the fool.

86
00:06:25,138 --> 00:06:29,335
When we were in Singapore, we fought
an orangutan stand user, but this is...

87
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:31,591
Who does this stupid mutt think he is?!

88
00:06:31,729 --> 00:06:34,925
Bastard. Don't make me turn you into dog meat!

89
00:06:36,616 --> 00:06:38,757
What the hell? It turned into sand!

90
00:06:39,117 --> 00:06:40,370
I can't cut him!

91
00:06:41,381 --> 00:06:44,951
Damn it! His stand has solidified
and grabbed hold of my rapier!

92
00:06:45,374 --> 00:06:46,208
Is that...

93
00:06:46,511 --> 00:06:49,676
Yes, the dog's stand is made entirely out of sand.

94
00:06:49,701 --> 00:06:54,370
Hmm. As simple as the design is, it's so
powerful, I'm not sure I could land a punch.

95
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:55,637
Guys!

96
00:06:55,751 --> 00:06:59,351
What are you doing?! Help! Get this dog off of me!

97
00:06:59,451 --> 00:07:03,692
I'm sorry, Polnareff, but if it's all
the same to you, I'd like to keep my hair.

98
00:07:03,717 --> 00:07:04,952
You monster!

99
00:07:05,714 --> 00:07:07,942
Did you happen to bring his favorite snack with you?

100
00:07:07,967 --> 00:07:09,068
Of course I did.

101
00:07:09,101 --> 00:07:10,668
He wouldn't have come with us otherwise.

102
00:07:10,693 --> 00:07:13,681
For the love of god, stop! Help me!

103
00:07:19,745 --> 00:07:22,296
The dog's sense of smell is simply incredible.

104
00:07:22,321 --> 00:07:23,024
And that is?

105
00:07:23,049 --> 00:07:24,822
It's coffee-flavored chewing gum,

106
00:07:24,847 --> 00:07:28,863
and Iggy will do just about anything
to savor this tasty little morsel.

107
00:07:29,123 --> 00:07:30,634
No, Mr. Avdol!

108
00:07:30,669 --> 00:07:32,831
Quickly, hide the packet before he...

109
00:07:33,926 --> 00:07:35,912
Blast it! He grabbed the whole thing!

110
00:07:40,542 --> 00:07:43,863
He can't get enough of his
coffee-flavored gum, as you can see.

111
00:07:43,888 --> 00:07:47,269
People, on the other hand, are
a different story, unfortunately.

112
00:07:47,669 --> 00:07:49,852
The least he can do is take the wrapping off.

113
00:07:49,877 --> 00:07:53,094
How is a gum-obsessed, feral dog supposed to help us?

114
00:07:53,214 --> 00:07:53,665
Good grief.

115
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:55,345
Damn that little menace!

116
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:58,426
He's completely ruined my picturesque hair!

117
00:07:58,583 --> 00:08:00,680
Petit con!

118
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,400
He'll be distracted while he's chewing his gum.

119
00:08:03,746 --> 00:08:05,030
Let's get the supplies.

120
00:08:09,333 --> 00:08:11,863
Here's the food and water you'll
be needing for your trip, sir.

121
00:08:11,906 --> 00:08:13,040
Oh, thank you.

122
00:08:13,381 --> 00:08:15,918
There are medical supplies and a change of clothes, too.

123
00:08:16,018 --> 00:08:19,395
We also took the Liberty of buying
a new camera to use with your stand.

124
00:08:19,468 --> 00:08:23,116
Yeah, I suppose it'll be a lot
easier than using a TV, right?

125
00:08:23,223 --> 00:08:26,081
Oh, I know. Look sharp, men!

126
00:08:26,112 --> 00:08:26,816
Hmm?

127
00:08:30,589 --> 00:08:33,435
Fantastic. This is a perfect memento.

128
00:08:37,852 --> 00:08:40,880
Avdol! Hurry up, and give the mutt the stupid gum!

129
00:08:41,488 --> 00:08:43,270
Now, why in the world would I do that

130
00:08:43,295 --> 00:08:46,618
when the two of you are already
such good friends, Polnareff?

131
00:08:49,846 --> 00:08:51,170
Well, if that's everything,

132
00:08:51,203 --> 00:08:53,948
I think we're going to be heading back now, Mr. Joestar.

133
00:08:54,506 --> 00:08:56,176
Answer this before you leave.

134
00:08:56,827 --> 00:08:59,062
It's regarding my daughter's condition.

135
00:09:00,632 --> 00:09:02,540
And I want you to be straight with me.

136
00:09:02,907 --> 00:09:04,780
How's my baby girl holding up?

137
00:09:07,148 --> 00:09:09,907
Well, to be perfectly frank with you, sir,

138
00:09:09,932 --> 00:09:11,555
it's not looking good right now.

139
00:09:12,162 --> 00:09:15,790
She's rapidly losing strength, and
nothing seems to help her condition.

140
00:09:17,023 --> 00:09:19,591
Our doctors at the Speedwagon foundation say

141
00:09:19,911 --> 00:09:21,697
she has two weeks at best.

142
00:09:25,198 --> 00:09:26,393
We're all out of time.

143
00:09:26,553 --> 00:09:28,048
This is bullshit.

144
00:09:28,248 --> 00:09:30,441
I also have some other information, sir.

145
00:09:30,667 --> 00:09:31,213
Hmm?

146
00:09:31,553 --> 00:09:33,924
Our investigators say that two days ago,

147
00:09:34,174 --> 00:09:36,079
nine unidentified men and women

148
00:09:36,104 --> 00:09:38,718
gathered in a building believed to be Dio's hideout.

149
00:09:39,036 --> 00:09:41,569
Apparently they came and left together.

150
00:09:43,037 --> 00:09:45,321
Dio has rounded up nine more people?!

151
00:09:45,366 --> 00:09:47,042
We have no clue who they are.

152
00:09:47,336 --> 00:09:49,869
The spy who reported this was killed shortly after,

153
00:09:50,231 --> 00:09:52,346
and the mansion where they met has been vacated.

154
00:09:52,872 --> 00:09:55,489
We've had no luck in locating these individuals.

155
00:09:56,211 --> 00:09:57,464
We thought about tailing them,

156
00:09:57,557 --> 00:10:01,151
but since our spies aren't stand users,
we decided it would be too dangerous.

157
00:10:01,176 --> 00:10:03,074
So these people are stand users?!

158
00:10:03,154 --> 00:10:03,786
Hold on.

159
00:10:04,305 --> 00:10:05,483
Think about it for a minute.

160
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:06,699
That would be impossible.

161
00:10:06,985 --> 00:10:09,174
Other than hol horse's stand, the emperor,

162
00:10:09,315 --> 00:10:11,965
the only tarot card that still remains is the world.

163
00:10:12,343 --> 00:10:14,503
I've been suspecting that one belongs to Dio,

164
00:10:14,528 --> 00:10:16,671
but now I'm not sure. Avdol?

165
00:10:16,716 --> 00:10:18,431
I... I don't know.

166
00:10:18,604 --> 00:10:20,610
I just can't wrap my head around this.

167
00:10:20,678 --> 00:10:22,490
Nine more stand users?

168
00:10:22,954 --> 00:10:28,866
From what I can gather, it seems that Dio's
head hasn't been able to adjust to his new body yet.

169
00:10:29,412 --> 00:10:31,738
But that monster would never run from us.

170
00:10:31,938 --> 00:10:34,415
He's far too conceited for something like that.

171
00:10:34,653 --> 00:10:37,983
He'll do everything within his
power to keep us out of Cairo.

172
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:40,112
Good freakin' grief.

173
00:10:40,183 --> 00:10:43,146
We have to take out nine stand users in two weeks, huh?

174
00:10:43,475 --> 00:10:46,044
Man, that is one hell of a whirlwind tour.

175
00:10:46,361 --> 00:10:48,269
Have a safe trip, Mr. Joestar.

176
00:10:48,674 --> 00:10:49,990
We await your return.

177
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:52,783
Thanks for your help. Look after my Holly.

178
00:11:16,691 --> 00:11:17,611
That mutt...

179
00:11:17,989 --> 00:11:21,404
So it sniffed out the great N'Doul from that far away?

180
00:11:40,339 --> 00:11:42,641
So close.

181
00:11:44,365 --> 00:11:46,955
What do you know? I almost caught it this time.

182
00:11:47,125 --> 00:11:48,822
Just a bit more practice.

183
00:11:50,219 --> 00:11:52,838
All of this because of the tsetse fly.

184
00:11:53,138 --> 00:11:54,914
If not for those insects,

185
00:11:54,939 --> 00:11:59,474
Joestar and his band of meddlers would
never have known master Dio was in Egypt.

186
00:12:26,877 --> 00:12:29,703
Mr. Joestar, why are you letting him get away with this?

187
00:12:29,728 --> 00:12:32,956
It's not fair he gets to be in the
back seat while we're stuck in the trunk!

188
00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:36,026
And in case you didn't know,
it's not exactly spacious back here.

189
00:12:36,063 --> 00:12:37,704
I'm gonna need a chiropractor!

190
00:12:37,729 --> 00:12:41,746
Look, I know it's not ideal, but you'll just
have to wait until the gum runs out of flavor.

191
00:12:42,188 --> 00:12:46,058
When it does, throw another stick of
gum into the trunk to lure him back there.

192
00:12:46,289 --> 00:12:48,322
Then you can all switch seats with him.

193
00:12:49,072 --> 00:12:52,028
All right, all right. Calm down already, flea bag.

194
00:12:52,149 --> 00:12:53,376
Damn, you're annoying.

195
00:12:58,019 --> 00:12:58,705
Whoa!

196
00:12:58,730 --> 00:13:00,267
What the hell was that?!

197
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:02,395
Hey, quickly, look over there!

198
00:13:04,154 --> 00:13:05,896
There! Do you see it?!

199
00:13:06,362 --> 00:13:07,709
It's the helicopter!

200
00:13:09,682 --> 00:13:12,411
The Speedwagon foundation helicopter went down.

201
00:13:12,436 --> 00:13:13,897
I can't believe what I'm seeing.

202
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:20,334
There's no sign of an explosion or gunfire.

203
00:13:20,441 --> 00:13:23,549
It seems like it just fell out
of the sky for no reason at all.

204
00:13:23,574 --> 00:13:24,521
Could it be...

205
00:13:24,612 --> 00:13:25,332
Careful, men!

206
00:13:25,706 --> 00:13:28,478
I'd bet my life it was attacked by an enemy stand!

207
00:13:28,503 --> 00:13:30,316
Over there, it's the pilot!

208
00:13:33,462 --> 00:13:34,866
He's already dead.

209
00:13:36,807 --> 00:13:39,254
Whatever happened to him... it wasn't pretty.

210
00:13:39,599 --> 00:13:41,561
Eh, the poor bastard.

211
00:13:42,034 --> 00:13:43,288
Approach carefully.

212
00:13:43,648 --> 00:13:46,329
Whatever did this could still be hiding in there.

213
00:13:55,353 --> 00:13:56,428
It's water.

214
00:14:04,435 --> 00:14:06,772
There's no way all that water is just from his mouth.

215
00:14:06,957 --> 00:14:08,747
It must be flowing from somewhere else.

216
00:14:08,917 --> 00:14:11,253
It must be from his lungs.

217
00:14:12,226 --> 00:14:13,690
And the fish would mean...

218
00:14:14,454 --> 00:14:15,961
He drowned in the desert!

219
00:14:16,213 --> 00:14:18,081
This is getting weirder and weirder!

220
00:14:18,228 --> 00:14:19,622
What is going on?

221
00:14:19,676 --> 00:14:20,749
H-hey!

222
00:14:20,995 --> 00:14:22,837
We found the other guy over here!

223
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:24,010
He's alive!

224
00:14:26,954 --> 00:14:28,949
Hang on! You have to talk to us!

225
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:30,246
Tell us what happened!

226
00:14:33,218 --> 00:14:34,503
Wa...

227
00:14:35,991 --> 00:14:37,948
Water.

228
00:14:37,981 --> 00:14:40,107
What? Are you saying you need water?

229
00:14:40,467 --> 00:14:42,524
Hurry, Polnareff, hand me the canteen!

230
00:14:42,584 --> 00:14:43,777
Huh? Oh, yeah.

231
00:14:45,544 --> 00:14:47,187
Here. You just hang in there.

232
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:48,420
Drink this.

233
00:14:48,799 --> 00:14:49,956
Drink it slowly.

234
00:14:57,749 --> 00:14:58,408
No!

235
00:14:58,433 --> 00:14:59,910
The water attacked us!

236
00:14:59,934 --> 00:15:00,472
What?!

237
00:15:06,108 --> 00:15:08,276
Men, watch yourselves! It's a stand!

238
00:15:08,301 --> 00:15:10,728
The enemy stand is inside the canteen!

239
00:15:13,189 --> 00:15:14,629
Eh, damn it all.

240
00:15:15,453 --> 00:15:17,515
They were just innocent bystanders.

241
00:15:17,739 --> 00:15:19,487
What reason did it have to kill them?

242
00:15:19,955 --> 00:15:22,792
Avdol, did you see what kind of stand we're dealing with?

243
00:15:22,817 --> 00:15:24,687
I just saw the shape of a hand,

244
00:15:24,712 --> 00:15:27,020
but I'd wager it's still inside the canteen.

245
00:15:27,257 --> 00:15:29,301
I don't believe I saw it leave.

246
00:15:30,176 --> 00:15:31,820
Who could the user be?

247
00:15:32,009 --> 00:15:36,124
The foundation members informed us Dio
had a meeting with nine men and women.

248
00:15:36,149 --> 00:15:38,861
Is it possible that one of them is the assassin?

249
00:15:39,161 --> 00:15:41,480
Hey, I need you to find the stand user.

250
00:15:41,505 --> 00:15:44,559
Yeah, I know. I'm already on it. That said...

251
00:15:50,541 --> 00:15:53,601
I don't see anything around us, let alone the stand user.

252
00:15:53,641 --> 00:15:57,544
When we duked it out with that sun stand, he
was hiding behind a mirror, but this time...

253
00:15:58,531 --> 00:16:02,494
The enemy seems to be so far away that
we'll never be able to find him from here.

254
00:16:14,861 --> 00:16:17,552
Polnareff, slice up the canteen, would you?

255
00:16:17,989 --> 00:16:18,891
Why me?

256
00:16:19,011 --> 00:16:19,891
Besides,

257
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:21,795
didn't you see what happened to the pilot?

258
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:25,201
His entire head got sucked
into that tiny, little container!

259
00:16:25,589 --> 00:16:29,099
Think about it! If I so much
as poke a hole in that thing...

260
00:16:30,296 --> 00:16:30,918
No way.

261
00:16:30,954 --> 00:16:32,758
Why don't you slice it up, Kakyoin?

262
00:16:32,816 --> 00:16:34,053
You're closer anyhow!

263
00:16:34,139 --> 00:16:37,312
You can just use your emerald
splash and call it a day, can't you?!

264
00:16:37,377 --> 00:16:38,827
Yes, but I don't want to.

265
00:16:39,543 --> 00:16:42,533
Don't make me do something just
because you don't want to do it!

266
00:16:42,633 --> 00:16:44,781
What the hell, man?! What's going on with you?!

267
00:16:44,908 --> 00:16:46,602
I've said no, and that's final.

268
00:16:46,627 --> 00:16:49,904
Well, like I said, I'm not gonna
attack the damn thing, either!

269
00:16:49,929 --> 00:16:50,891
Hmm?

270
00:16:57,586 --> 00:16:59,306
Th-that's the...

271
00:17:03,684 --> 00:17:05,766
K-Kakyoin!

272
00:17:06,563 --> 00:17:11,005
It's the water! The stand left the canteen
disguised as water and hid in the blood!

273
00:17:11,235 --> 00:17:12,376
No, that's wrong!

274
00:17:12,449 --> 00:17:15,077
The stand wasn't disguising itself as water at all!

275
00:17:15,268 --> 00:17:16,911
I think the stand is the water!

276
00:17:16,936 --> 00:17:18,671
No! It got Kakyoin!

277
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:22,012
It clawed out Kakyoin's eyes!

278
00:17:22,045 --> 00:17:24,931
Polnareff, panicking isn't going to help anything!

279
00:17:24,995 --> 00:17:26,791
Summon chariot for protection!

280
00:17:32,114 --> 00:17:34,364
Damn it. It'll get Polnareff, too!

281
00:17:47,467 --> 00:17:49,053
This doesn't make any sense.

282
00:17:49,078 --> 00:17:51,263
Why would it go after the pilot's corpse?

283
00:17:51,288 --> 00:17:54,974
It wasn't the corpse. The target was the watch.

284
00:17:55,456 --> 00:17:57,726
It attacked the watch because of the alarm.

285
00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:02,033
That's it! The stand stalks its victims by sound!

286
00:18:02,058 --> 00:18:03,193
You're kidding.

287
00:18:09,127 --> 00:18:10,351
Get out of there, Polnareff!

288
00:18:10,376 --> 00:18:12,005
It's coming after you now!

289
00:18:14,464 --> 00:18:15,903
Hurry, and get to the car!

290
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:27,293
It's so fast!

291
00:18:29,372 --> 00:18:30,829
Faster, Polnareff!

292
00:18:37,875 --> 00:18:39,318
I-it got me!

293
00:18:39,343 --> 00:18:41,743
Hermit purple!

294
00:18:49,542 --> 00:18:51,310
The stand disappeared into the ground!

295
00:18:51,335 --> 00:18:52,258
I see now.

296
00:18:52,283 --> 00:18:54,574
It detects sound through vibrations in the ground,

297
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:57,353
and it moves through the earth,
so there's no way to find it.

298
00:18:57,468 --> 00:18:59,547
That puts us at a major disadvantage.

299
00:18:59,643 --> 00:19:05,141
Since we can't see it, the stand has the ability to
attack from above or below at any moment it chooses.

300
00:19:06,216 --> 00:19:09,744
To make things worse, the stand
user could be kilometers away.

301
00:19:18,935 --> 00:19:21,863
So the prey has sought refuge atop the car.

302
00:19:22,254 --> 00:19:27,233
Seems they've realized N'Doul is using the power of sound
to hunt them down one by one.

303
00:19:29,445 --> 00:19:30,253
No matter.

304
00:19:30,278 --> 00:19:32,806
It won't be long before they're all eliminated.

305
00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:41,436
Hey, how's Kakyoin doing?

306
00:19:41,525 --> 00:19:44,669
Not good. From the looks of
things he may have been blinded.

307
00:19:45,355 --> 00:19:46,438
We have to get going.

308
00:19:46,463 --> 00:19:48,667
He needs to see a doctor as soon as possible.

309
00:19:48,756 --> 00:19:52,105
But if we try to move from this
spot, that stand will attack us.

310
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:54,975
We can't afford careless mistakes.

311
00:20:13,550 --> 00:20:15,331
What the hell?!

312
00:20:22,156 --> 00:20:24,062
Hmm? That sound...

313
00:20:24,189 --> 00:20:25,531
It's the dog.

314
00:20:25,637 --> 00:20:29,896
Interesting. It leapt out of
the car before I could attack.

315
00:20:30,067 --> 00:20:32,998
It anticipated what my stand was going to do.

316
00:20:33,023 --> 00:20:36,181
Seems like this dog is going to be quite the nuisance.

317
00:20:36,388 --> 00:20:37,767
The tires are in the water!

318
00:20:37,989 --> 00:20:39,187
Shit! What now?!

319
00:20:39,554 --> 00:20:41,357
The whole car's about to be pulled in!

320
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:43,150
I can't hold him for long!

321
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:45,383
Everyone, we have to move to the back!

322
00:20:45,408 --> 00:20:47,429
Hey, you good-for-nothing mongrel!

323
00:20:47,529 --> 00:20:49,832
Aren't you supposed to be helping us or something?!

324
00:20:51,661 --> 00:20:55,551
I see. That accursed dog is
too perceptive for his own good.

325
00:20:55,690 --> 00:20:58,725
It knows I'm four kilometers west of Joestar's group.

326
00:21:00,724 --> 00:21:02,173
What to do?

327
00:21:05,027 --> 00:21:08,071
Perhaps I should do away with the dog right now.

328
00:21:13,558 --> 00:21:15,800
Yeah, sleep while we fight to survive!

329
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,515
You're a bastard. You know that?

330
00:21:24,501 --> 00:21:27,130
Never mind. The dog is of no concern.

331
00:21:27,421 --> 00:21:30,764
Joestar and the others can't control that mongrel, anyway.

332
00:21:31,083 --> 00:21:33,557
The mutt's harmless if all it does is nap.

333
00:21:36,399 --> 00:21:37,563
Now for the kill.

334
00:21:39,838 --> 00:21:43,814
Son of a bitch! The water's sharp
enough to slash through our front tires!

335
00:21:43,907 --> 00:21:45,909
Move to the other side on the double!

336
00:21:46,034 --> 00:21:50,154
If it's trying to do what I think it is,
then we're gonna need to hang on for our lives!
