1
00:00:01,985 --> 00:00:04,156
Have your injuries improved any, Avdol?

2
00:00:04,181 --> 00:00:06,552
They have. As relieved as I am,

3
00:00:06,861 --> 00:00:09,262
I'm even more relieved knowing you're all right.

4
00:00:09,287 --> 00:00:13,129
Yes, well, I'm fortunate there was
no significant damage to my cornea.

5
00:00:13,434 --> 00:00:15,488
I'm expected to make a full recovery.

6
00:00:15,743 --> 00:00:17,534
This takes me back to middle school.

7
00:00:17,632 --> 00:00:22,337
During what should have been an ordinary game,
one of my classmates took a baseball to the eye.

8
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:24,474
He was good as new the next day,

9
00:00:24,726 --> 00:00:27,684
and as it turned out, his eye
had only lost a bit of fluid.

10
00:00:27,816 --> 00:00:29,123
Wait. Are you serious?

11
00:00:29,148 --> 00:00:30,181
No!

12
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:32,476
I'll get these bandages off in no time,

13
00:00:32,513 --> 00:00:34,502
and I'll catch up with you in a few days.

14
00:00:35,016 --> 00:00:37,916
In 800 kilometers are Cairo and Dio.

15
00:00:38,799 --> 00:00:41,553
Everyone, you must remain vigilant.

16
00:00:42,944 --> 00:00:44,199
Now let's see.

17
00:00:44,905 --> 00:00:48,109
What kind of language is this
hospital bill written in, anyway?

18
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:50,113
I guess it's supposed to be Arabic,

19
00:00:50,243 --> 00:00:52,366
but, man, if this crap isn't confusing.

20
00:00:52,574 --> 00:00:56,706
The zero is a five, the decimal
is a zero, and the seven is a six.

21
00:00:56,917 --> 00:01:00,134
And what the heck is this
wormy-looking thingamajig supposed to be?

22
00:01:00,166 --> 00:01:02,605
It's a four, so the amount we owe is...

23
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:05,531
46,350 Egyptian pounds?!

24
00:01:05,556 --> 00:01:06,964
That's insane!

25
00:01:07,715 --> 00:01:09,502
How adorable!

26
00:01:09,582 --> 00:01:10,591
What kind of dog is he?

27
00:01:10,634 --> 00:01:11,570
He's so funny-looking.

28
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:14,285
Look at that. Why in the world is he chewing gum?

29
00:01:14,582 --> 00:01:16,398
He must be waiting for someone.

30
00:01:16,423 --> 00:01:18,164
Such a good little doggie.

31
00:01:18,393 --> 00:01:20,832
And here I thought Iggy was waiting for us outside.

32
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:21,432
Good grief.

33
00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:23,446
Looks like he's a hit with the ladies.

34
00:01:23,578 --> 00:01:26,369
Should we tell him doggies don't usually chew gum?

35
00:01:26,433 --> 00:01:28,009
What a peculiar little puppy.

36
00:01:28,055 --> 00:01:29,110
Hello there, ladies.

37
00:01:29,197 --> 00:01:29,884
Hmm?

38
00:01:29,909 --> 00:01:32,429
Here's a little bit of friendly advice for you girls.

39
00:01:32,454 --> 00:01:34,456
Step away if you know what's good for you.

40
00:01:34,522 --> 00:01:37,532
I know he comes across as a charming fur ball at first,

41
00:01:37,585 --> 00:01:41,037
but deep in his soul, he harbors
an extreme hatred for people.

42
00:01:41,062 --> 00:01:43,237
If you're not careful, when you least expect...

43
00:01:44,355 --> 00:01:45,598
What the hell are you doing?!

44
00:01:45,623 --> 00:01:47,252
Get off of me, you damn mutt!

45
00:01:51,026 --> 00:01:52,227
Such a cutie!

46
00:01:52,328 --> 00:01:54,169
Aww. You get along so well.

47
00:01:54,214 --> 00:01:56,449
In your dreams! We don't get along at all!

48
00:01:56,477 --> 00:01:58,811
Damn it, Iggy! Would you get the hell off of me?!

49
00:01:58,836 --> 00:02:00,232
We'll catch you guys later.

50
00:02:00,261 --> 00:02:01,429
See you, lovebirds.

51
00:02:01,469 --> 00:02:03,389
Mr. Joestar, please help me!

52
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:05,267
Hey, hang on a minute, would you?!

53
00:02:07,197 --> 00:02:08,290
What the hell?!

54
00:02:08,943 --> 00:02:11,854
You nasty little mutt!

55
00:03:43,749 --> 00:03:45,930
In ancient times, Egyptians were in the habit

56
00:03:45,955 --> 00:03:49,395
of burying their dead on the west
bank of the Nile, where the sun sets.

57
00:03:50,077 --> 00:03:53,613
That's the reason Egyptian cities
stand on the east side of the Nile.

58
00:03:53,864 --> 00:03:59,312
On the West Side, however, you're likely to
find graves and mortuary temples scattered about.

59
00:04:00,018 --> 00:04:02,575
But our enemies don't care about east or west.

60
00:04:02,653 --> 00:04:05,806
They'll come from whatever direction is most advantageous.

61
00:04:10,417 --> 00:04:12,818
Look, I know you didn't ask for my opinion,

62
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:15,300
but your cows are far too lethargic.

63
00:04:15,366 --> 00:04:17,455
Although, they're strong. I'll give 'em that.

64
00:04:18,512 --> 00:04:20,947
Hey, Chaka, move your ass, boy!

65
00:04:20,994 --> 00:04:23,216
And would you stop dragging the rear already?!

66
00:04:25,717 --> 00:04:26,859
What a disgrace.

67
00:04:26,899 --> 00:04:28,145
Some man you are.

68
00:04:28,465 --> 00:04:29,945
How are you my son?

69
00:04:31,506 --> 00:04:34,037
Looks like your son and your cow have something in common.

70
00:04:34,986 --> 00:04:35,511
Uh...

71
00:04:39,351 --> 00:04:40,318
A sword?

72
00:04:42,526 --> 00:04:44,574
What's something like this doing out here?

73
00:04:44,913 --> 00:04:46,750
Hey, look! It's a sword!

74
00:04:47,106 --> 00:04:47,999
Give me that!

75
00:04:48,726 --> 00:04:50,753
Look at that. Must have been dropped.

76
00:04:50,778 --> 00:04:52,856
I can't believe no one's come back to claim it.

77
00:04:53,173 --> 00:04:56,568
Their loss is our gain, 'cause this
sword is probably worth a fortune.

78
00:04:56,635 --> 00:04:59,343
Hey, what if the owner's still in the area?

79
00:04:59,450 --> 00:05:01,852
Poor guy must be panicking right about now.

80
00:05:01,892 --> 00:05:06,143
On the off chance it's some kind of fancy-schmancy
artifact, shouldn't we give it to the police?

81
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:10,071
You idiot, this sword could be
the end of all of our money troubles!

82
00:05:10,577 --> 00:05:12,330
But I'm the one who found it.

83
00:05:12,496 --> 00:05:14,722
It won't be worth a damn thing if it's blunt.

84
00:05:14,747 --> 00:05:16,213
Pull it out so we can take a look.

85
00:05:16,246 --> 00:05:16,858
Right!

86
00:05:22,221 --> 00:05:22,938
What's wrong?

87
00:05:23,171 --> 00:05:25,079
The damn thing won't budge.

88
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:26,863
Why the hell won't it come out?

89
00:05:27,117 --> 00:05:28,167
That's weird.

90
00:05:28,192 --> 00:05:29,047
Let me try it.

91
00:05:29,072 --> 00:05:29,720
Take it.

92
00:05:30,606 --> 00:05:31,806
You hold this end.

93
00:05:32,005 --> 00:05:32,653
Right.

94
00:05:39,113 --> 00:05:40,464
It's no use.

95
00:05:40,528 --> 00:05:42,848
The blade hasn't moved a single centimeter.

96
00:05:43,123 --> 00:05:44,783
Father, let me have a go.

97
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:47,290
Ah, shut up! If I can't free it,

98
00:05:47,315 --> 00:05:49,201
what chance does an idiot like you have?!

99
00:05:49,408 --> 00:05:49,854
Huh?!

100
00:05:50,465 --> 00:05:51,934
M-my hand!

101
00:05:52,152 --> 00:05:53,642
What happened to my hand?!

102
00:05:56,091 --> 00:05:58,899
My hand, why is it spewing blood?!

103
00:06:00,475 --> 00:06:02,377
How the hell did the sword cut me?!

104
00:06:02,416 --> 00:06:04,954
We pulled on the damn thing,
but the blade wouldn't come out.

105
00:06:04,979 --> 00:06:07,060
All I did was grab it by the hilt!

106
00:06:07,104 --> 00:06:09,000
There's something strange about that sword.

107
00:06:09,057 --> 00:06:11,908
Hey, uh, you think now's a good time for me to try?

108
00:06:11,933 --> 00:06:13,194
You know what?! Fine!

109
00:06:13,219 --> 00:06:14,841
Go ahead, and try it if you want!

110
00:06:27,017 --> 00:06:29,198
It came out so easy.

111
00:06:29,867 --> 00:06:32,326
I didn't put the slightest bit of effort into it.

112
00:06:33,213 --> 00:06:35,470
What? I can hear it.

113
00:06:36,089 --> 00:06:37,469
This makes no sense.

114
00:06:37,679 --> 00:06:39,716
I can hear the blade ringing.

115
00:06:42,236 --> 00:06:45,858
I'm by no means an expert when it
comes to swords or things of that nature,

116
00:06:45,966 --> 00:06:48,792
but I don't think I've ever
encountered a blade this beautiful.

117
00:06:48,824 --> 00:06:50,719
It's like a rare Japanese katana.

118
00:06:50,752 --> 00:06:53,264
It glistens, like it's cloaked in ice-cold water.

119
00:06:53,289 --> 00:06:55,828
We've been graced with an amazing discovery!

120
00:06:55,895 --> 00:06:57,170
Hand it over, my boy!

121
00:06:57,195 --> 00:07:00,841
A dolt like you has no business
wielding such a valuable treasure!

122
00:07:04,472 --> 00:07:05,276
Oh, god!

123
00:07:05,572 --> 00:07:07,280
Chaka, why?

124
00:07:07,539 --> 00:07:10,795
Why would you do this to your own father?!

125
00:07:11,597 --> 00:07:12,794
I don't know what happened!

126
00:07:12,858 --> 00:07:13,965
You were standing behind me...

127
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:15,442
And before I knew it, the sword...

128
00:07:15,467 --> 00:07:17,266
It's not my fault, I swear!

129
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:18,973
Why are you just standing there?!

130
00:07:18,998 --> 00:07:21,910
We have to hurry and get him
to a doctor before it's too late!

131
00:07:27,721 --> 00:07:28,939
This sword is evil!

132
00:07:28,964 --> 00:07:31,795
It's almost as though the blade has a mind of its own!

133
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:38,418
Be calm.

134
00:07:39,706 --> 00:07:41,794
Still your heart, Chaka.

135
00:07:42,635 --> 00:07:46,953
Their deaths mean nothing, nothing whatsoever, Chaka.

136
00:07:48,014 --> 00:07:50,123
Just... just who are you?

137
00:07:50,764 --> 00:07:53,666
I can't see you, but I can hear your voice.

138
00:07:54,554 --> 00:07:57,257
I am the stand of the god Anubis,

139
00:07:57,483 --> 00:07:59,151
ruler of the underworld,

140
00:07:59,176 --> 00:08:02,222
deity of embalming, and lord of the dead.

141
00:08:02,954 --> 00:08:04,262
You have unsheathed me.

142
00:08:04,287 --> 00:08:05,296
You are my flesh!

143
00:08:05,321 --> 00:08:07,338
Thus you shall be my stand user.

144
00:08:07,363 --> 00:08:08,858
You are a virtuoso.

145
00:08:08,883 --> 00:08:11,310
So I shall make you master of the sword.

146
00:08:11,335 --> 00:08:12,696
No one in the world is stronger than you.

147
00:08:12,721 --> 00:08:15,524
You shall wield me, and you shall kill!

148
00:08:20,032 --> 00:08:23,879
Father and that man deserved to die, so
they should be thrilled that I killed them.

149
00:08:24,744 --> 00:08:27,323
I think I'll hack you to pieces while I'm on a roll.

150
00:08:27,348 --> 00:08:29,936
Wait a minute, Chaka! You don't really wanna do this!

151
00:08:29,961 --> 00:08:32,837
Please let me live, okay?! I don't wanna die!

152
00:08:38,018 --> 00:08:39,882
How the hell did he do that?!

153
00:08:40,457 --> 00:08:42,738
Somehow the cow's completely unharmed.

154
00:08:51,755 --> 00:08:53,642
Slaughter Joseph.

155
00:08:53,826 --> 00:08:55,719
Slice Polnareff.

156
00:08:55,990 --> 00:08:58,434
Cleave Jotaro in two.

157
00:08:58,511 --> 00:09:02,776
You are a fighting genius, a master of the sword.

158
00:09:02,835 --> 00:09:06,804
No one in the world is a match for your blade, no one!

159
00:09:10,269 --> 00:09:11,292
Kom ombo?

160
00:09:11,557 --> 00:09:14,723
Come on. Do we really have time
to lounge around in this place?

161
00:09:15,274 --> 00:09:16,796
Would you quit complaining?

162
00:09:16,829 --> 00:09:21,317
They've been kind enough to allow us passage
on their ferry, so we must show our respect.

163
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:25,790
I don't know about you guys, but I'm
starving, so let's get something to eat.

164
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:27,650
Wow, you never stop, do you?

165
00:09:27,973 --> 00:09:29,943
Here. This should tide you over for now.

166
00:09:30,383 --> 00:09:32,167
You know damn well that's Iggy's!

167
00:09:32,198 --> 00:09:34,434
Would you just take the gum, already?

168
00:09:35,382 --> 00:09:37,288
Hey, where's the bathroom, huh?

169
00:09:37,313 --> 00:09:38,696
Shall we look for it?

170
00:09:39,993 --> 00:09:41,511
Hey, mister, over here!

171
00:09:42,108 --> 00:09:43,624
Wanna buy some papyrus?

172
00:09:43,946 --> 00:09:45,942
This papyrus is the original paper.

173
00:09:45,986 --> 00:09:47,622
Want a piece of Egyptian history?

174
00:09:47,694 --> 00:09:50,853
Here. Take a look. This is 100% bona fide papyrus!

175
00:09:50,878 --> 00:09:52,156
Papyrus, huh?

176
00:09:52,181 --> 00:09:53,830
I'll give you a good price.

177
00:09:53,973 --> 00:09:56,082
Are you positive this is the real thing?

178
00:09:56,107 --> 00:10:01,176
Of course, my friend. I'll have you know a famous
Egyptian craftsman drew this, so it's quite genuine.

179
00:10:01,436 --> 00:10:02,076
Hmm.

180
00:10:04,804 --> 00:10:06,723
This crap is fake, and you know it.

181
00:10:06,748 --> 00:10:09,631
If this were actual papyrus, it wouldn't rip so easily.

182
00:10:09,655 --> 00:10:10,629
I'm no fool.

183
00:10:10,654 --> 00:10:12,680
You should try a little harder next time.

184
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:14,890
What the... for the love of...

185
00:10:14,915 --> 00:10:17,016
Where'd Mr. Joestar and the others go?

186
00:10:17,737 --> 00:10:18,230
Huh?

187
00:10:25,705 --> 00:10:26,831
Was that Iggy?!

188
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:29,793
Why you... get back here, you little mutt!

189
00:10:29,895 --> 00:10:32,509
Hey! What about my money?!

190
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:40,827
Stupid dog. He managed to get away.

191
00:11:20,306 --> 00:11:25,520
Gotta say, if my hunch is correct,
then you've got a lot of balls, my friend.

192
00:11:25,845 --> 00:11:30,077
Seems like you're planning to attack me
while we're in a crowd of innocent bystanders.

193
00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:32,416
Guys like you are a rare breed.

194
00:11:32,492 --> 00:11:37,044
Stand users don't usually show themselves,
let alone face their attacker head-on.

195
00:11:38,112 --> 00:11:39,434
It's kind of noble.

196
00:11:40,059 --> 00:11:42,091
I didn't think you guys had that trait.

197
00:11:42,829 --> 00:11:43,766
Tell me your name.

198
00:11:49,368 --> 00:11:50,759
My name is Chaka,

199
00:11:51,297 --> 00:11:55,118
and my stand is known as Anubis,
the one true ruler of the underworld.

200
00:11:56,222 --> 00:11:58,333
Now then, Jean Pierre Polnareff,

201
00:11:58,565 --> 00:12:00,723
prepare to surrender your life to me.

202
00:12:02,468 --> 00:12:04,267
You want me to surrender my life?

203
00:12:04,344 --> 00:12:07,510
Man, oh, man, you sure don't mince words, do you, Chaka?

204
00:12:07,535 --> 00:12:11,416
If nothing else, your confidence is
more impressive than your other companions.

205
00:12:20,225 --> 00:12:21,686
Give me your best shot.

206
00:12:21,902 --> 00:12:24,941
Let's see if your Anubis stand
is all it's cracked up to be.

207
00:12:38,091 --> 00:12:39,400
Come out, chariot.

208
00:12:44,363 --> 00:12:50,097
He's brandishing his sword, but is he really
planning to fight me with that instead of his stand?

209
00:12:55,267 --> 00:12:56,473
Something's off.

210
00:13:00,793 --> 00:13:03,531
His movements, his grip, his stance,

211
00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:05,723
they're the dead giveaways of an amateur,

212
00:13:05,748 --> 00:13:07,383
but that doesn't make sense.

213
00:13:08,181 --> 00:13:10,240
I need to keep my distance from him.

214
00:13:33,503 --> 00:13:35,213
What the hell is going on here?

215
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:37,842
His sword passed right through the pillar,

216
00:13:37,964 --> 00:13:39,319
and if that wasn't enough,

217
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:42,811
he cut me without leaving even a single tear in my shirt.

218
00:13:43,127 --> 00:13:46,203
If I hadn't stepped back when
I did, I would have been killed.

219
00:13:47,251 --> 00:13:49,065
You bastard! Chariot!

220
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:53,805
Damn it!

221
00:13:54,024 --> 00:13:58,136
Why don't you show yourself and face
me like a real fighter, you coward?!

222
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:04,862
Huh?

223
00:14:14,405 --> 00:14:15,292
Merde.

224
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,560
This can't be happening.

225
00:14:17,754 --> 00:14:18,774
I lost him.

226
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:21,995
He could be hiding behind any one of these pillars.

227
00:14:22,068 --> 00:14:23,541
Judging from his attacks,

228
00:14:23,566 --> 00:14:25,988
his sword can pass through solid objects.

229
00:14:26,137 --> 00:14:30,486
And unfortunately for me, my chariot's
striking range is only about one meter.

230
00:14:30,543 --> 00:14:33,291
Damn it. He's tougher than I thought he'd be.

231
00:14:33,511 --> 00:14:38,575
I honestly can't believe this asshole is actually
giving me a run for my money in a sword fight.

232
00:14:38,695 --> 00:14:40,300
But Mark my words.

233
00:14:40,334 --> 00:14:42,478
You won't have the upper hand for long.

234
00:14:45,162 --> 00:14:46,960
Hey, Chaka, are you listening?!

235
00:14:46,985 --> 00:14:49,756
I've got a nice view, so let's see what you've got!

236
00:14:49,781 --> 00:14:52,946
There's no way you can sneak up
on me if I'm not behind a pillar,

237
00:14:53,078 --> 00:14:55,561
unless you're planning on popping out of the ground.

238
00:15:08,617 --> 00:15:09,343
What the...

239
00:15:10,706 --> 00:15:12,020
He's behind the pillar?!

240
00:15:12,045 --> 00:15:14,373
My sword doesn't need to pass through objects!

241
00:15:14,445 --> 00:15:17,779
With the power of this blade, I
can cut through the pillar itself!

242
00:15:18,609 --> 00:15:20,429
Now die, Polnareff!

243
00:15:39,057 --> 00:15:41,043
Man, that was a close one.

244
00:15:41,796 --> 00:15:45,195
That technique is so secret that
not even Jotaro knows about it.

245
00:15:45,530 --> 00:15:47,590
Silver chariot can launch its rapier.

246
00:15:47,946 --> 00:15:50,380
The downside is I only get one shot.

247
00:15:50,595 --> 00:15:52,678
If my opponent dodges, I'm history.

248
00:15:52,857 --> 00:15:55,818
A last resort once I've exhausted my other options.

249
00:15:58,099 --> 00:16:00,059
While it's true I didn't kill you,

250
00:16:00,091 --> 00:16:03,116
I highly doubt you'll be
getting back up for another round.

251
00:16:04,034 --> 00:16:04,583
Hmm?

252
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:09,707
That's peculiar.

253
00:16:12,496 --> 00:16:15,366
How the heck did it get back into its scabbard?

254
00:16:15,612 --> 00:16:17,389
Did it slip in by chance?

255
00:16:31,856 --> 00:16:35,713
I didn't notice before, but now that I see it up close,

256
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,701
I fully appreciate the sword's beauty.

257
00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:40,887
I have to unsheathe it.

258
00:16:45,643 --> 00:16:46,150
Huh?

259
00:16:48,106 --> 00:16:49,341
Hey, there, Polnareff.

260
00:16:49,374 --> 00:16:50,462
Thought we'd lost you.

261
00:16:50,487 --> 00:16:53,163
We were worried when you up and vanished by yourself.

262
00:16:53,194 --> 00:16:55,564
We thought you'd been ambushed by the enemy.

263
00:17:00,134 --> 00:17:01,387
Wait. Are you okay?

264
00:17:01,465 --> 00:17:01,974
Huh?

265
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:05,531
Oh. Oh! It's you, Mr. Joestar.

266
00:17:05,869 --> 00:17:07,928
I'm so fuzzy, I can't think straight.

267
00:17:08,145 --> 00:17:09,894
Maybe it's from being tossed around

268
00:17:10,101 --> 00:17:12,111
or my injuries are worse than I thought.

269
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:18,347
Polnareff, why are you squatting like that?

270
00:17:18,396 --> 00:17:20,051
You didn't step in poop, did you?

271
00:17:20,271 --> 00:17:20,875
Huh?

272
00:17:21,353 --> 00:17:24,083
Polnareff, how did you come across that sword?

273
00:17:24,108 --> 00:17:25,725
Did something happen out here?

274
00:17:25,817 --> 00:17:26,326
Yeah.

275
00:17:26,778 --> 00:17:29,461
I had a showdown with some dirtbag that attacked me.

276
00:17:29,513 --> 00:17:31,208
What? An enemy stand user?!

277
00:17:31,233 --> 00:17:32,651
It's all over now.

278
00:17:32,919 --> 00:17:35,585
He said his stand was known as the god Anubis.

279
00:17:36,628 --> 00:17:41,996
It was able to literally phase through objects
and cut them once it had a target in its crosshairs.

280
00:17:42,573 --> 00:17:43,979
He was a strong foe.

281
00:17:44,282 --> 00:17:46,307
"But despite his formidable power,"

282
00:17:46,332 --> 00:17:49,873
"when all was said and done, he
was no match for the likes of me,"

283
00:17:49,898 --> 00:17:51,581
Polnareff reassured himself.

284
00:17:51,789 --> 00:17:53,892
He was using this sword as his weap...

285
00:17:53,916 --> 00:17:56,027
Where did it go?

286
00:17:57,175 --> 00:17:58,428
Where'd those rats come from,

287
00:17:58,453 --> 00:18:00,310
and why are they making off with the sword?!

288
00:18:00,335 --> 00:18:01,493
Get outta here!

289
00:18:02,688 --> 00:18:04,686
Jeez, talk about creepy.

290
00:18:05,085 --> 00:18:08,154
No one told me even the rats steal stuff in this place.

291
00:18:09,445 --> 00:18:12,690
If you guys wanna steal something, steal some cheese.

292
00:18:15,693 --> 00:18:17,023
That's unusual.

293
00:18:17,601 --> 00:18:19,288
The sword's stuck in the scabbard.

294
00:18:19,477 --> 00:18:21,310
It's jammed in here really tight.

295
00:18:21,425 --> 00:18:22,778
Hey, Polnareff,

296
00:18:23,101 --> 00:18:24,918
while I'm relieved that you're all right,

297
00:18:24,955 --> 00:18:27,378
don't ever run off by yourself again. Got it?

298
00:18:27,445 --> 00:18:28,402
It's dangerous.

299
00:18:28,433 --> 00:18:32,679
The enemy will find a way to attack you
even if you're just alone for a few seconds.

300
00:18:35,329 --> 00:18:36,904
Oh, crap, I forgot.

301
00:18:36,929 --> 00:18:39,357
That's the sound of our ship taking off without us.

302
00:18:39,382 --> 00:18:40,945
We need to hurry and get on board.

303
00:18:40,970 --> 00:18:42,271
We're heading to Edfu today.

304
00:18:42,316 --> 00:18:44,696
Wha... c-come on, guys. Wait for me!

305
00:18:52,975 --> 00:18:56,647
Polnareff, so you decided to
bring the sword with you after all?

306
00:18:56,741 --> 00:18:59,071
Yeah. I'm gonna turn it in to the police.

307
00:18:59,096 --> 00:19:01,177
This thing is a dangerous weapon, you know.

308
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,917
Hmm. That's a good plan.

309
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:06,511
Anyone could pick it up at those
ruins, so we can't take any chances.

310
00:19:06,536 --> 00:19:08,464
It's probably worth a small fortune.

311
00:19:10,763 --> 00:19:11,385
Huh?

312
00:19:14,656 --> 00:19:16,857
Quiet, Iggy. You can't make noise in here.

313
00:19:16,924 --> 00:19:19,176
If you keep this up, we could get kicked out.

314
00:19:20,958 --> 00:19:23,213
What the hell is wrong with that mutt, today?

315
00:19:23,481 --> 00:19:25,738
Ah, well, since the damn dog won't shut up,

316
00:19:25,763 --> 00:19:28,061
I guess I'll just take the sword to the cops now.

317
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:32,397
Polnareff, weren't you listening when
we told you not to go off on your own?

318
00:19:32,656 --> 00:19:35,001
Seriously, we talked about this earlier.

319
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:37,962
Jotaro, tag along, and keep him out of trouble, would you?

320
00:19:38,148 --> 00:19:38,933
Gotcha.

321
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:53,881
Hey, shouldn't our first stop
have been the police station?

322
00:19:54,446 --> 00:19:56,187
Oh, take it easy, Jotaro.

323
00:19:56,285 --> 00:19:59,571
A man's got to look his absolute best, as the saying goes.

324
00:19:59,603 --> 00:20:01,225
Oh, before I forget,

325
00:20:02,158 --> 00:20:04,811
old man, you mind putting this over there out of the way?

326
00:20:04,878 --> 00:20:05,485
Sure.

327
00:20:05,643 --> 00:20:07,548
That thing's a dangerous weapon.

328
00:20:08,379 --> 00:20:10,397
All right, back to what I saying earlier.

329
00:20:10,429 --> 00:20:13,987
I did a fair amount of rolling
around and ended up getting kinda dirty.

330
00:20:14,179 --> 00:20:17,015
Make this face gorgeous again, Mr. Barber.

331
00:20:17,048 --> 00:20:17,943
Will do.

332
00:20:19,163 --> 00:20:21,407
Ow! Ow!

333
00:20:21,485 --> 00:20:22,915
Hey, would you watch it?!

334
00:20:22,946 --> 00:20:25,401
In case you haven't noticed, that razor's dull!

335
00:20:25,461 --> 00:20:27,836
Come on, Mr. Barber! Sharpen that thing!

336
00:20:27,862 --> 00:20:30,840
This is supposed to be the
most relaxing part of the haircut!

337
00:20:30,981 --> 00:20:34,036
Oh, good grief. You're such a prima Donna.

338
00:20:34,914 --> 00:20:38,297
You're right, sir. My apologies.

339
00:20:59,497 --> 00:21:00,370
Mmm.

340
00:21:15,655 --> 00:21:18,258
Oh. Mm, better.

341
00:21:18,716 --> 00:21:19,702
Much better.

342
00:21:19,730 --> 00:21:21,629
Now that's a shave, Mr. Barber.

343
00:21:21,726 --> 00:21:23,255
That's what I'm talking about.

344
00:21:23,356 --> 00:21:24,239
Thank you.

345
00:21:25,152 --> 00:21:26,598
I'm glad to hear it.

346
00:21:27,311 --> 00:21:28,879
Tres bien, barber.

347
00:21:28,904 --> 00:21:30,506
Tres bien, man!

348
00:21:30,722 --> 00:21:33,287
And now if you wouldn't mind getting under my chin.

349
00:21:33,457 --> 00:21:34,454
Sure.

350
00:21:35,394 --> 00:21:36,807
Right here...

351
00:21:37,188 --> 00:21:39,268
Under your chin, yes?

352
00:21:39,293 --> 00:21:40,561
Mm? Huh?

353
00:21:44,087 --> 00:21:46,826
You did say under your chin, right, Polnareff?!

354
00:21:47,031 --> 00:21:48,334
What the hell?!

355
00:21:49,587 --> 00:21:51,220
Remember me, you fool?

356
00:21:51,245 --> 00:21:54,335
I'm the Anubis stand, and this time, you're going to die!
