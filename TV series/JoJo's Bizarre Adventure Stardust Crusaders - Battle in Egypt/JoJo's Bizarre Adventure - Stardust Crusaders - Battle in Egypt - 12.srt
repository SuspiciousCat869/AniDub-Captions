1
00:00:06,141 --> 00:00:07,668
Shit, it's dark in here.

2
00:00:07,754 --> 00:00:09,140
I can't see a damn thing.

3
00:00:09,842 --> 00:00:11,939
Where the hell is that bastard, anyway?

4
00:00:19,372 --> 00:00:23,019
It's the middle of the day, and I still
have to feel my way around this hovel.

5
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:24,480
This had better be worth it.

6
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:30,150
Okay, if I remember correctly,
I'll find Dio over in that room.

7
00:00:36,316 --> 00:00:37,777
Ugh! Disgusting.

8
00:00:37,977 --> 00:00:40,594
This little lady must be one of Dio's leftovers.

9
00:00:40,674 --> 00:00:42,955
Damn broads just throw themselves at the guy,

10
00:00:43,001 --> 00:00:45,968
like having their blood drank is the latest bedroom craze.

11
00:00:46,222 --> 00:00:48,288
The whole thing's nutty if you ask me,

12
00:00:48,462 --> 00:00:51,319
though girls do tend to go for the bad boys.

13
00:00:52,043 --> 00:00:53,252
But forget about that.

14
00:00:53,298 --> 00:00:55,226
I've never seen so much gold in my life.

15
00:00:55,278 --> 00:00:56,618
How'd he get all this?

16
00:00:57,967 --> 00:01:01,365
Seems like this guy can have and do just about anything.

17
00:01:07,699 --> 00:01:08,627
Hmm.

18
00:01:09,268 --> 00:01:10,603
Hol Horse...

19
00:01:11,731 --> 00:01:12,857
What is it?

20
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:23,596
It's master Dio.

21
00:01:30,584 --> 00:01:31,885
Son of a bitch.

22
00:01:31,974 --> 00:01:32,842
What is this?

23
00:01:33,027 --> 00:01:36,124
Just lookin' at him is enough
to send chills down my spine.

24
00:01:38,646 --> 00:01:40,193
Keep it together, Hol Horse.

25
00:01:40,294 --> 00:01:41,413
Don't let him spook you.

26
00:01:42,517 --> 00:01:44,150
He's nothin' to lose your cool over.

27
00:01:44,467 --> 00:01:46,956
Yeah, he's not even that much stronger than you.

28
00:01:48,162 --> 00:01:49,664
I'll ask you again.

29
00:01:50,099 --> 00:01:52,938
Did you want something, Hol Horse?

30
00:01:53,199 --> 00:01:55,043
Uh, well, yes, actually.

31
00:01:55,562 --> 00:01:57,289
There's somethin' I thought you oughta know.

32
00:01:57,388 --> 00:02:02,296
I received Intel that two of the nine great gods,
Mariah and Alessi, have been put out of commission.

33
00:02:02,836 --> 00:02:04,269
And your point is?

34
00:02:05,275 --> 00:02:06,664
Well, there's more.

35
00:02:06,777 --> 00:02:07,962
We've got trouble comin'.

36
00:02:08,356 --> 00:02:11,555
Turns out Joestar and his gang
will arrive in Cairo tomorrow,

37
00:02:11,622 --> 00:02:13,902
and only three of the nine gods are left.

38
00:02:13,993 --> 00:02:16,500
It seems you've misunderstood my question.

39
00:02:16,881 --> 00:02:19,673
I want to know what you're going to do, Hol Horse.

40
00:02:19,697 --> 00:02:20,197
Eh?!

41
00:02:20,291 --> 00:02:22,630
You seem to have been caught rather off guard.

42
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:26,222
I simply wish to know when
you're going kill them, Hol Horse.

43
00:02:26,656 --> 00:02:29,319
While it's true you've pledged your allegiance to me,

44
00:02:29,712 --> 00:02:33,098
you have yet to adequately prove yourself in battle.

45
00:02:34,035 --> 00:02:38,127
In this day and age, any
simpleton can deliver information.

46
00:02:38,389 --> 00:02:43,022
Twice you've failed me, and here you are crawling back.

47
00:02:56,210 --> 00:03:01,843
You couldn't know this, but my body once
belonged to a man by the name of Jonathan Joestar.

48
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:05,367
Jonathan was the grandfather of Joseph Joestar.

49
00:03:05,768 --> 00:03:06,991
Look closely.

50
00:03:07,303 --> 00:03:11,000
Notice how the left finger heals
at a slower rate than the right?

51
00:03:12,013 --> 00:03:14,625
The left side of this body is weak,

52
00:03:14,986 --> 00:03:18,291
which proves that it doesn't completely belong to me yet

53
00:03:18,697 --> 00:03:20,673
and that I am not yet immortal.

54
00:03:20,895 --> 00:03:25,007
I am ill-equipped to fight a
battle with Joestar and his friends.

55
00:03:29,314 --> 00:03:31,631
Now then, if there is nothing else,

56
00:03:31,771 --> 00:03:35,135
run along, and destroy my enemies on my behalf.

57
00:03:35,473 --> 00:03:39,674
Failure will most assuredly
result in your untimely demise.

58
00:03:39,727 --> 00:03:41,749
You're barkin' up the wrong tree, hoss.

59
00:03:41,889 --> 00:03:45,235
As if threats are gonna make me
roll over and do whatever you want.

60
00:03:46,601 --> 00:03:48,305
On your behalf, my ass.

61
00:03:48,832 --> 00:03:52,597
I'm no fool. I'm smart enough to
throw in with whoever's strongest.

62
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:55,469
Everything I've said has been lip service.

63
00:03:55,505 --> 00:03:58,666
I'd never swear my loyalty to you at the cost of my soul.

64
00:03:59,563 --> 00:04:02,383
Rat bastard, you're not so tough, are you?

65
00:04:02,736 --> 00:04:04,109
You're wide open.

66
00:04:04,275 --> 00:04:08,332
Guess having another person's body
attached to your head has made you go soft.

67
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:10,030
This is perfect.

68
00:04:10,156 --> 00:04:12,295
I don't have to fight Joseph and the other three,

69
00:04:12,468 --> 00:04:14,755
not when I've got Dio in my crosshairs.

70
00:04:15,155 --> 00:04:19,518
It'd be a hell of a lot easier to blow
his head to smithereens right here and now.

71
00:04:22,898 --> 00:04:25,238
If I do, his treasure's mine for the takin'.

72
00:04:25,392 --> 00:04:26,907
This'll be a piece of cake.

73
00:04:27,193 --> 00:04:30,067
He doesn't know Emperor's aimed point-blank at his skull.

74
00:04:30,186 --> 00:04:32,481
I could finish him off, and he'll be none the wiser.

75
00:04:33,055 --> 00:04:36,355
Just one pull of the trigger,
and this nightmare will be over.

76
00:04:37,034 --> 00:04:40,345
After all, Emperor was made for close-combat carnage.

77
00:04:40,496 --> 00:04:42,519
I can do this. I can do this.

78
00:04:43,198 --> 00:04:46,090
Is there a problem? You seem to be hesitating.

79
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:48,216
Eat lead, shit-bag!

80
00:04:48,445 --> 00:04:52,783
I'm about to splatter your
brains all over the floor, Mr. Dio!

81
00:04:52,928 --> 00:04:55,957
Are you positive you want to go through with shooting me?

82
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:00,731
Huh?

83
00:05:01,731 --> 00:05:02,631
He's gone!

84
00:05:05,228 --> 00:05:06,390
Fascinating.

85
00:05:06,769 --> 00:05:10,507
As you prepared to fire, your breathing was relaxed.

86
00:05:10,531 --> 00:05:12,346
You didn't even perspire.

87
00:05:12,536 --> 00:05:14,101
You were composed.

88
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:16,425
Very impressive, Hol Horse.

89
00:05:27,871 --> 00:05:29,673
This doesn't make a lick of sense.

90
00:05:29,886 --> 00:05:31,645
I didn't even see him move.

91
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:36,793
There's no way in hell he could have creeped up behind
me without breaking a single one of those spider webs.

92
00:05:37,413 --> 00:05:41,678
Fast or not, he shouldn't have been able to
sneak up to my rear without me noticing something.

93
00:05:42,112 --> 00:05:44,983
Was that the power of Dio's stand,

94
00:05:45,335 --> 00:05:46,854
the power of The World?

95
00:05:47,236 --> 00:05:49,344
Ill-equipped? Yeah, right.

96
00:05:50,239 --> 00:05:53,121
I-I finally understand, master Dio.

97
00:05:53,810 --> 00:05:57,393
I've got no choice but to
pledge my eternal loyalty to you.

98
00:05:57,968 --> 00:06:00,061
Y-you've got me beat.

99
00:07:35,913 --> 00:07:40,391
Ladies and gentlemen, we sincerely hope
you've enjoyed today's flight from Aswan.

100
00:07:40,535 --> 00:07:44,515
We'll be arriving on schedule at
Cairo international airport shortly.

101
00:07:59,023 --> 00:08:01,087
Whoops! Snooze, you loose, buddy!

102
00:08:01,721 --> 00:08:05,623
I hate to break it to you, cowboy,
but it looks like this is our cab now.

103
00:08:06,823 --> 00:08:08,410
No hard feelings?

104
00:08:08,916 --> 00:08:12,726
Huh? Don't tell me you're gonna
start cryin' like a baby! Hah!

105
00:08:18,296 --> 00:08:19,857
Shit! What the hell?!

106
00:08:23,354 --> 00:08:26,073
Giza Pronto, the mena house hotel.

107
00:08:33,047 --> 00:08:35,616
I'm gonna open up this suitcase and let you out.

108
00:08:35,646 --> 00:08:38,834
Unless you want some grade-a
pain, I suggest you keep calm.

109
00:08:38,858 --> 00:08:39,587
We clear?

110
00:08:39,612 --> 00:08:42,178
Huh? Did you, uh, say something just now, sir?

111
00:08:42,264 --> 00:08:45,948
If I did, it sure the hell wasn't to
you. Now shut up, and drive the cab!

112
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,576
Ehh! Yes, sir.

113
00:08:58,241 --> 00:08:59,207
Cut it out.

114
00:08:59,491 --> 00:09:01,268
You know, if you weren't makin' such a damn racket,

115
00:09:01,309 --> 00:09:04,964
I wouldn't have had to hogtie you and put
you on the plane like a piece of luggage!

116
00:09:05,246 --> 00:09:07,048
Don't be a baby, Mondatta.

117
00:09:07,137 --> 00:09:10,195
Your brother's got another month
in the hospital thanks to that bomb,

118
00:09:10,219 --> 00:09:11,718
so you and I are partners.

119
00:09:11,913 --> 00:09:15,191
Now make sure those big ears are
listening, 'cause here's what we're gonna do.

120
00:09:15,528 --> 00:09:18,135
We're gonna use your book of
premonitions and my assassin gun

121
00:09:18,181 --> 00:09:21,619
to stamp out Jotaro, Joseph, and the rest of those S.O.Bs!

122
00:09:21,721 --> 00:09:22,965
Got that, Mondatta?!

123
00:09:23,543 --> 00:09:25,398
I get that we haven't known each other long,

124
00:09:25,464 --> 00:09:29,643
but from what I've gathered, you're afraid of
just about anyone that's not your brother, Zenyatta.

125
00:09:30,304 --> 00:09:33,387
But don't you think this is the
perfect chance to avenge the guy?

126
00:09:33,547 --> 00:09:37,359
You don't wanna be a yellow-bellied
coward forever, right? That's no good.

127
00:09:37,678 --> 00:09:39,009
I'm out of options, too.

128
00:09:39,082 --> 00:09:40,824
We've got no choice but to fight.

129
00:09:41,417 --> 00:09:43,823
Time for us to get our revenge, Mondatta.

130
00:09:44,785 --> 00:09:50,239
I'm gonna let you loose now, but you have to swear to me
you won't carry on with all that infernal hollering, okay?

131
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,220
See that, son?

132
00:09:53,414 --> 00:09:54,579
I'm not so bad.

133
00:09:54,698 --> 00:09:56,344
Now try and settle down, eh?

134
00:09:56,504 --> 00:09:58,039
I don't need you gettin' sick on me,

135
00:09:58,925 --> 00:10:01,923
'cause believe it or not, I'm
on your side in this whole mess.

136
00:10:01,948 --> 00:10:03,274
So don't you worry.

137
00:10:03,298 --> 00:10:04,766
Just relax for now.

138
00:10:08,966 --> 00:10:09,561
Huh?

139
00:10:12,404 --> 00:10:14,953
Sir, why do you have a puking kid?!

140
00:10:14,978 --> 00:10:15,683
Shut up!

141
00:10:16,897 --> 00:10:17,822
I see.

142
00:10:18,053 --> 00:10:20,715
You got motion sickness from being on the plane.

143
00:10:20,831 --> 00:10:24,543
Mondatta, I-let's be pals from here on.

144
00:10:24,603 --> 00:10:25,892
How's that sound?

145
00:10:29,674 --> 00:10:30,875
"I'm Mondatta.

146
00:10:31,067 --> 00:10:32,400
"This is Hol Horse.

147
00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:34,560
"He's mean, and I don't like him!

148
00:10:35,074 --> 00:10:38,761
"While Mondatta was sleeping, Hol Horse
tied him up and stuffed him in a trunk.

149
00:10:38,795 --> 00:10:41,270
"Mondatta was taken from his brother, Zenyatta.

150
00:10:41,323 --> 00:10:42,413
"He was sad.

151
00:10:42,733 --> 00:10:45,179
"But even though Mondatta was scared out of his mind,

152
00:10:45,212 --> 00:10:46,943
"he wanted to avenge his brother,

153
00:10:47,021 --> 00:10:50,873
"so he decided to work up his courage
and become partners with Hol Horse."

154
00:10:51,351 --> 00:10:52,284
Hmm?

155
00:10:54,274 --> 00:10:55,254
Oh, come on!

156
00:10:55,414 --> 00:10:56,673
You won't even get near me?

157
00:10:56,760 --> 00:11:00,091
Well, I guess you're tryin', which
is all I can ask for at this point.

158
00:11:00,812 --> 00:11:02,496
And by the way, I gotta know.

159
00:11:02,574 --> 00:11:06,817
Does your stand really predict the
future, or is that just some cockamamie rumor?

160
00:11:07,071 --> 00:11:10,554
If that was all just a tall tale,
then I brought you here for nothin'.

161
00:11:10,654 --> 00:11:13,498
I mean, even with it, your
brother got blown to high heaven.

162
00:11:15,156 --> 00:11:17,129
Which is it, kid?! Are you a fraud?!

163
00:11:18,267 --> 00:11:18,885
Hmm?

164
00:11:20,357 --> 00:11:23,537
How'd a new comic appear on a
blank page from out of nowhere?

165
00:11:24,037 --> 00:11:27,453
"While Mondatta and Hol Horse" were
walking through the outskirts of Cairo,

166
00:11:27,511 --> 00:11:30,447
"they met a lady who was as pretty as the day was long.

167
00:11:30,788 --> 00:11:33,567
Then Hol Horse jump-kicked the lady in the neck!"

168
00:11:33,681 --> 00:11:34,267
Hmm?

169
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:39,627
"The pretty lady "was so overjoyed about the kick
that, "out of the blue, she gave Hol Horse her jewels.

170
00:11:39,667 --> 00:11:41,541
Yahoo! We're rich!"

171
00:11:43,015 --> 00:11:45,004
What the hell is this crap?!

172
00:11:45,824 --> 00:11:47,775
You must think I was born last night!

173
00:11:47,808 --> 00:11:49,615
You call this a prediction, Mondatta?!

174
00:11:49,722 --> 00:11:50,955
There's just no way!

175
00:11:51,109 --> 00:11:53,080
This crap has to be made up or somethin'.

176
00:11:53,114 --> 00:11:54,887
I'm telling the truth.

177
00:11:54,935 --> 00:11:58,708
My stand, Thoth, you just have to trust in its prophecies.

178
00:11:58,757 --> 00:12:01,805
Th-th-they're 100...

179
00:12:02,017 --> 00:12:04,205
They're 100% right every time.

180
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:06,162
They're right 100%?

181
00:12:06,202 --> 00:12:08,143
You tryin' to pull the wool over my eyes?!

182
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:12,338
There's no way some lady's gonna give me
her jewels after jump-kickin' her in the neck.

183
00:12:12,417 --> 00:12:15,339
You'd have to be off your
rocker to do somethin' like that.

184
00:12:15,364 --> 00:12:15,839
Hmm?

185
00:12:23,761 --> 00:12:24,987
Listen, Mondatta.

186
00:12:25,087 --> 00:12:28,473
I am proud to say that I'm a
gentleman and a proper gentleman at that.

187
00:12:28,612 --> 00:12:30,828
'Cause of that, I got girls all over the world.

188
00:12:31,014 --> 00:12:34,516
I might tell a white lie now and
again, but I'd never haul off and hit one.

189
00:12:34,814 --> 00:12:39,096
I respect all the ladies, the beauties,
the plain ones, and even the ugly ones.

190
00:12:41,061 --> 00:12:43,882
There's no way your prediction will ever come to pass.

191
00:12:43,976 --> 00:12:47,199
Come hell or high water, I swear I will never hit a woman.

192
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:51,585
She could pay me every dime, nickel, and quarter
she had. I still wouldn't put my hands on her.

193
00:12:51,728 --> 00:12:53,978
It's 100% true, yes.

194
00:13:01,331 --> 00:13:01,858
Hmph.

195
00:13:02,224 --> 00:13:02,918
See there?

196
00:13:02,976 --> 00:13:04,541
Your fancy prediction was wrong.

197
00:13:05,337 --> 00:13:05,801
Huh?

198
00:13:23,854 --> 00:13:25,270
Who the hell are you?!

199
00:13:30,405 --> 00:13:31,195
What in the...

200
00:13:31,388 --> 00:13:33,748
Th-there was a scorpion in your shawl!

201
00:13:34,514 --> 00:13:36,597
This thing's sting is a death sentence.

202
00:13:36,622 --> 00:13:37,272
What?!

203
00:13:39,113 --> 00:13:43,211
You spotted that wretched creature before
it had a chance to crawl into my clothes.

204
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:44,318
If you hadn't killed it,

205
00:13:44,452 --> 00:13:45,929
she would have been stung for sure.

206
00:13:48,382 --> 00:13:49,641
You saved my life.

207
00:13:49,883 --> 00:13:51,728
Oh, please, let me repay you.

208
00:13:52,045 --> 00:13:54,135
Would my necklace be a sufficient reward?

209
00:13:54,228 --> 00:13:55,160
It's yours.

210
00:13:58,283 --> 00:14:00,002
Boy, this is my lucky day.

211
00:14:00,174 --> 00:14:02,413
Mondatta and I are practically invincible.

212
00:14:02,438 --> 00:14:04,310
We'll be the unstoppable duo!

213
00:14:13,232 --> 00:14:15,691
I don't think I'm gonna be able to help you folks.

214
00:14:16,059 --> 00:14:20,278
It's been my job to repair rooftops
in Cairo for around 40 years now,

215
00:14:20,391 --> 00:14:23,027
and I can't say that I've ever seen a place like this.

216
00:14:23,141 --> 00:14:24,984
From the looks of the building's design,

217
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:27,446
the thing was built over a hundred years ago,

218
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:28,530
give or take.

219
00:14:28,674 --> 00:14:31,245
If I had to take a guess, based on the picture,

220
00:14:31,316 --> 00:14:33,640
I'd say you'd find it somewhere south of here.

221
00:14:33,865 --> 00:14:37,580
The buildings in Cairo get older
and older the farther south you travel.

222
00:14:37,873 --> 00:14:38,575
Huh?

223
00:14:38,904 --> 00:14:41,407
I'm sorry I don't have more to go on, Sonny.

224
00:14:41,533 --> 00:14:42,948
No, don't worry about it.

225
00:14:43,021 --> 00:14:43,988
Sorry to bother.

226
00:14:50,603 --> 00:14:53,242
All right, understood. Thanks for the update.

227
00:14:57,108 --> 00:14:59,216
I decided to make a call to Japan,

228
00:14:59,325 --> 00:15:01,517
and my daughter's condition is much worse.

229
00:15:01,674 --> 00:15:03,648
She's lost virtually all of her strength.

230
00:15:04,341 --> 00:15:06,589
At best, she has three or four days left.

231
00:15:13,074 --> 00:15:14,620
I can almost feel it.

232
00:15:14,955 --> 00:15:16,889
It's like Dio's right on top of us.

233
00:15:16,956 --> 00:15:19,795
I'd bet anything that he's hiding somewhere close by,

234
00:15:20,219 --> 00:15:23,122
but where could he be, and how do we find him?

235
00:15:23,782 --> 00:15:24,864
We should get moving.

236
00:15:24,957 --> 00:15:27,117
We'll talk to everyone here until we find him.

237
00:15:27,253 --> 00:15:29,751
Hmm. We've come this far.

238
00:15:29,943 --> 00:15:31,377
We have to keep going.

239
00:15:38,918 --> 00:15:40,422
Been a long time comin',

240
00:15:40,486 --> 00:15:42,407
but it's time for our grand reunion.

241
00:15:42,447 --> 00:15:44,072
I'm getting sick of those faces.

242
00:15:44,097 --> 00:15:46,798
I never thought they'd get so
close to master Dio's mansion,

243
00:15:46,864 --> 00:15:49,103
but they're on a collision course for his backyard.

244
00:15:49,397 --> 00:15:51,530
And by the way, listen, Mondatta!

245
00:15:58,425 --> 00:16:00,487
We need to chat about your latest prediction.

246
00:16:00,606 --> 00:16:02,704
You sure it's 100% foolproof?

247
00:16:03,335 --> 00:16:05,010
It's more than a little wacky.

248
00:16:05,063 --> 00:16:06,890
They're not dumb enough to fall for this.

249
00:16:08,255 --> 00:16:10,323
B-but my premonitions... ow!

250
00:16:10,377 --> 00:16:13,286
"My premonitions are always 100% accurate."

251
00:16:13,354 --> 00:16:14,842
Is that what you were gonna say?

252
00:16:14,873 --> 00:16:16,710
Well, they are, yes.

253
00:16:16,735 --> 00:16:17,695
Come on!

254
00:16:17,723 --> 00:16:20,123
You really expect me to buy this load of baloney?

255
00:16:20,206 --> 00:16:21,996
I think you've lost your touch, boy.

256
00:16:22,483 --> 00:16:24,564
"'We found them!' shouted Hol Horse.

257
00:16:24,828 --> 00:16:27,763
"'Joseph, Jotaro, Polnareff, and Avdol.

258
00:16:27,788 --> 00:16:29,463
"Darn it, ' Hol Horse fumed.

259
00:16:29,543 --> 00:16:32,484
"'They're a hop, skip, and a
jump "'away from master Dio's manor.

260
00:16:32,522 --> 00:16:35,648
Those nosy buffoons'll each
get a bullet between the eyes.'"

261
00:16:35,761 --> 00:16:38,047
"Hol Horse's mind was full of violent thoughts.

262
00:16:38,177 --> 00:16:40,037
"'You're gonna pay for my brother!'

263
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:43,048
"Mondatta was beside himself with anger.

264
00:16:43,117 --> 00:16:45,478
"But despite the pair wanting immediate payback,

265
00:16:45,551 --> 00:16:48,402
Hol Horse couldn't use his
gun, the Emperor, in the market."

266
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:52,977
"'Now, Hol Horse, ' Mondatta instructed,

267
00:16:53,003 --> 00:16:55,482
"'stick your fingers all the way up Polnareff's nose,

268
00:16:55,507 --> 00:16:57,003
"'and then we'll win!

269
00:16:57,916 --> 00:17:00,016
"'They're out cold from losing all that blood.

270
00:17:00,076 --> 00:17:01,349
"'lucky you, Hol Horse.

271
00:17:01,414 --> 00:17:03,899
This is your chance to finish them off for good.'"

272
00:17:04,667 --> 00:17:06,454
Like hell I'm gonna buy that!

273
00:17:07,162 --> 00:17:09,044
This is your big premonition?

274
00:17:09,077 --> 00:17:12,575
Sticking my calloused fingers up
Polnareff's booger-infested nose?

275
00:17:12,615 --> 00:17:15,929
The hell do you take me for? Well, speak, Mondatta!

276
00:17:16,056 --> 00:17:19,139
The part about killing 'em sounds
good to me, but the rest of it...

277
00:17:19,265 --> 00:17:21,809
You'd better not be planning anything funny, boy.

278
00:17:21,945 --> 00:17:23,299
I mean, come on!

279
00:17:23,330 --> 00:17:26,166
Even if I was supposed to stick
my fingers up Polnareff's nose,

280
00:17:26,239 --> 00:17:28,683
I'd have to somehow get close enough to him to do it.

281
00:17:30,547 --> 00:17:32,020
Instead of all that skullduggery,

282
00:17:32,045 --> 00:17:35,467
I think we should go with the direct
approach and put a bullet in him with Emperor!

283
00:17:35,491 --> 00:17:36,425
What do you say?

284
00:17:36,534 --> 00:17:39,513
Y-you're not gonna be able to fire a bullet, yes.

285
00:17:39,605 --> 00:17:41,988
E-even though you tried firing your stand,

286
00:17:42,013 --> 00:17:43,861
fate wouldn't let you, yes.

287
00:17:44,496 --> 00:17:45,963
You have to trust me, yes.

288
00:17:45,997 --> 00:17:47,399
I know from personal experience,

289
00:17:47,473 --> 00:17:50,509
I-If you try to go against the
comic, you'll suffer the consequences.

290
00:17:50,541 --> 00:17:54,487
It's fate, I tell you. It's
100% up to the whims of fate, yes.

291
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:55,511
Hang on!

292
00:17:55,855 --> 00:17:58,145
Your brother followed the comic and nearly died.

293
00:17:59,152 --> 00:18:01,848
M-my brother was trying to save himself,

294
00:18:01,901 --> 00:18:05,408
but he foolishly disguised himself
as Jotaro without thinking, yes.

295
00:18:05,747 --> 00:18:11,237
If he had trusted what he read and not disguised himself,
then the real Jotaro would have been blown up, yes.

296
00:18:11,537 --> 00:18:14,270
The premonition itself was correct, yes.

297
00:18:15,838 --> 00:18:16,918
Then what now?

298
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:18,169
Hmm?

299
00:18:18,273 --> 00:18:20,252
Wait! Where did Polnareff go?

300
00:18:20,979 --> 00:18:23,320
Hey, kid, Polnareff left the herd.

301
00:18:23,627 --> 00:18:24,893
Find out where he went.

302
00:18:26,386 --> 00:18:28,287
Shit! It can't be.

303
00:18:29,629 --> 00:18:30,948
Don't you move...

304
00:18:31,582 --> 00:18:33,482
Unless you'd like to be lanced.

305
00:18:34,168 --> 00:18:36,274
But... how the hell did you...

306
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:47,755
Imbecile! What exactly did you
think you were trying to pull just now?

307
00:18:47,848 --> 00:18:50,754
If you know what's good for you,
keep your hands where I can see them.

308
00:18:52,773 --> 00:18:56,590
I thought I noticed someone stalking
us like a desperate, starving hyena,

309
00:18:56,615 --> 00:19:00,756
and wouldn't you know, I was lucky enough
to stumble across our old friend, Hol Horse.

310
00:19:00,796 --> 00:19:04,877
It looks you're still trying to kill us,
which means you haven't learned your lesson yet.

311
00:19:05,663 --> 00:19:08,276
Say, thanks for all the fun back in India.

312
00:19:08,463 --> 00:19:10,910
You're very lucky Avdol survived our run-in,

313
00:19:11,030 --> 00:19:12,239
'cause if he hadn't,

314
00:19:12,472 --> 00:19:15,260
you, my friend, would already be dead.

315
00:19:16,562 --> 00:19:18,408
You here alone, Hol Horse?

316
00:19:18,850 --> 00:19:22,363
No way. A coward like you wouldn't come by himself.

317
00:19:22,734 --> 00:19:25,266
I'm sure he's hiding out nearby, right?

318
00:19:25,562 --> 00:19:27,263
Well, where's your partner?

319
00:19:27,496 --> 00:19:28,222
Crap!

320
00:19:28,308 --> 00:19:31,037
On the upside, though, he hasn't noticed Mondatta yet.

321
00:19:31,289 --> 00:19:32,507
I still have a chance.

322
00:19:36,605 --> 00:19:37,476
Shit!

323
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:39,598
He's gonna see the book and his fingers.

324
00:19:40,164 --> 00:19:42,712
On your own, you're not much of a threat, Hol Horse,

325
00:19:42,758 --> 00:19:46,218
but I'm well aware that you have a
special talent for picking allies.

326
00:19:46,558 --> 00:19:50,941
If you've found someone to work with like
before, that could make you a dangerous obstacle.

327
00:19:51,174 --> 00:19:53,300
Tell me, where did your partner go?

328
00:19:53,453 --> 00:19:55,688
Out with it. Where is the other stand user?

329
00:19:56,075 --> 00:19:57,155
Your fingers.

330
00:19:57,350 --> 00:19:59,558
Mondatta, hide your fingers.

331
00:19:59,765 --> 00:20:02,660
If he gets wise to where you are, it's all over.

332
00:20:03,317 --> 00:20:04,797
You have to believe.

333
00:20:04,949 --> 00:20:08,322
The reason you're in this situation
is because you tried using your gun.

334
00:20:08,726 --> 00:20:10,606
Trust me. Believe in fate.

335
00:20:10,739 --> 00:20:15,034
If you believe in the power of
fate, our victory is guaranteed, yes.

336
00:20:17,355 --> 00:20:17,692
Hmm?

337
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:18,230
Huh?

338
00:20:19,685 --> 00:20:23,506
I saw a hand go under the box,
which means my hunch was right.

339
00:20:23,531 --> 00:20:24,941
What's the word, Polnareff?

340
00:20:24,966 --> 00:20:27,003
Did you find the guy that was following us?

341
00:20:28,384 --> 00:20:31,464
Oh, no, it's Avdol, and he's headed straight for us.

342
00:20:32,211 --> 00:20:33,915
Believe, yes.

343
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:38,669
Put your faith in the book, and stick
your fingers up Polnareff's nose, yes!

344
00:20:38,789 --> 00:20:40,153
Are you serious?

345
00:20:40,524 --> 00:20:41,126
Damn it.

346
00:20:42,027 --> 00:20:42,784
Hmm?

347
00:20:43,443 --> 00:20:44,049
Hmm...

348
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:46,302
I've got no choice.

349
00:20:46,474 --> 00:20:47,554
Fine. I'll do it!

350
00:20:49,537 --> 00:20:51,550
You under the crate, show yourself!

351
00:20:51,803 --> 00:20:53,611
Now, while he's looking the other way!

352
00:20:53,636 --> 00:20:55,311
I know you're hiding under there!

353
00:20:59,348 --> 00:21:00,447
What the hell?!

354
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,306
Hell, yeah!

355
00:21:09,737 --> 00:21:11,815
"'Whoo-hoo! Everyone bled so much,

356
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:14,334
"'they all passed out! Lucky you, Hol Horse!

357
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:16,889
Now's your chance to finish them off!'"

358
00:21:17,424 --> 00:21:20,309
So when is this so-called chance supposed to get here,

359
00:21:20,518 --> 00:21:22,058
and what do I do 'til then?

360
00:21:22,936 --> 00:21:24,837
Excuse me, Hol Horse.

361
00:21:24,862 --> 00:21:26,772
Uh, what the hell are you doing?

362
00:21:26,843 --> 00:21:30,112
You're not the only one who wants
to know the answer to that question.

363
00:21:30,172 --> 00:21:32,704
I haven't the foggiest idea where to go from here.

364
00:21:33,064 --> 00:21:35,028
What am I supposed to do?

365
00:21:36,150 --> 00:21:38,153
Hey, what's the matter, Polnareff?

366
00:21:39,062 --> 00:21:40,675
He's not answering back.

367
00:21:40,715 --> 00:21:41,995
Something's off.

368
00:21:42,082 --> 00:21:43,492
Shit! What now?!

369
00:21:43,684 --> 00:21:45,379
They're on me like white on rice!

370
00:21:45,727 --> 00:21:46,296
Damn it!

371
00:21:46,455 --> 00:21:49,795
How the hell do I make the rest
of this stupid prediction come true?

372
00:21:50,787 --> 00:21:52,413
This is crazy.

373
00:21:52,538 --> 00:21:54,493
What am I supposed to do?!
