1
00:00:00,447 --> 00:00:02,806
Everyone, hold on!

2
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:05,213
Yaah!

3
00:00:05,386 --> 00:00:07,153
Oh, no!

4
00:00:19,362 --> 00:00:20,836
It sunk into the sand.

5
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:24,321
We should all be all right as long as
we don't move and don't make a sound.

6
00:00:27,608 --> 00:00:31,009
It's much too late to try hiding from me at this point.

7
00:00:31,363 --> 00:00:35,495
I know where each of you landed. There's no escaping now.

8
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:54,256
Four... no, five steps.

9
00:00:55,083 --> 00:00:58,304
I get it. You're walking quietly to avoid detection.

10
00:00:59,410 --> 00:01:01,151
But you can't hide from me.

11
00:01:01,833 --> 00:01:02,621
Tsk, tsk.

12
00:01:03,271 --> 00:01:06,290
It appears these "steps" have thrown him for a loop.

13
00:01:06,444 --> 00:01:08,310
Go ahead, you accursed water stand.

14
00:01:08,389 --> 00:01:10,040
Just try to attack us,

15
00:01:10,253 --> 00:01:12,192
because the moment you reveal yourself,

16
00:01:12,217 --> 00:01:15,124
I'll vaporize you with the power of my magician's red.

17
00:02:59,742 --> 00:03:00,498
He's here.

18
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:06,361
Hold on. What's this?

19
00:03:06,386 --> 00:03:08,361
He only moved five steps forward.

20
00:03:09,567 --> 00:03:10,506
How strange.

21
00:03:10,531 --> 00:03:12,320
Why has he suddenly stopped moving?

22
00:03:15,109 --> 00:03:15,827
Now!

23
00:03:17,903 --> 00:03:20,109
Magician's red!

24
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:23,250
What?!

25
00:03:26,142 --> 00:03:27,995
Avdol!

26
00:03:34,419 --> 00:03:35,957
How can he be so...

27
00:03:37,283 --> 00:03:38,377
So quick?

28
00:03:39,191 --> 00:03:40,302
Avdol!

29
00:03:41,937 --> 00:03:45,664
I have to admit that plan was
actually a stroke of brilliance.

30
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:49,136
I have to pay more attention
to their vibrations from now on.

31
00:03:50,233 --> 00:03:51,879
Those weren't footsteps at all.

32
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:54,776
It would seem as though he threw some kind of metal rings.

33
00:03:54,816 --> 00:03:56,631
And judging by these burns...

34
00:03:57,478 --> 00:03:59,444
I'd say Avdol did the deed.

35
00:04:00,931 --> 00:04:02,730
But c'est la vie.

36
00:04:06,253 --> 00:04:07,606
Farewell...

37
00:04:10,549 --> 00:04:12,036
Avdol.

38
00:04:14,421 --> 00:04:15,851
Hmm? What's this?

39
00:04:16,028 --> 00:04:17,345
Someone started running.

40
00:04:17,565 --> 00:04:19,033
Jotaro, what are you doing?!

41
00:04:19,058 --> 00:04:20,962
You know we can't just run around!

42
00:04:22,533 --> 00:04:25,022
His stride says he's about 190...

43
00:04:25,047 --> 00:04:28,232
No, 195 centimeters tall.

44
00:04:28,506 --> 00:04:31,827
There's a youthfulness in his stride, so he's not Joseph.

45
00:04:31,885 --> 00:04:35,709
It must be Jotaro then, but where exactly is he going?

46
00:04:37,355 --> 00:04:38,316
It dove in!

47
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:40,260
I think it's going after Jotaro!

48
00:04:40,285 --> 00:04:41,737
This can't be happening!

49
00:04:42,104 --> 00:04:45,115
I'm grateful he's not attacking Avdol anymore, but...

50
00:04:45,448 --> 00:04:48,187
Jotaro! He's catching up to you!

51
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:53,972
I hear Jotaro's star platinum is
the fiercest of the enemies' stands.

52
00:04:54,158 --> 00:04:58,515
Master Dio will be beside himself with
joy if I take care of him here and now.

53
00:04:58,859 --> 00:05:00,591
In the name of master Dio,

54
00:05:00,616 --> 00:05:04,445
I'll use every fiber of my
being to finally vanquish Jotaro.

55
00:05:10,933 --> 00:05:13,052
Hmm. If I heard correctly,

56
00:05:13,177 --> 00:05:15,697
Jotaro just picked something up off the sand.

57
00:05:16,076 --> 00:05:18,845
Let's see. What was at that location?

58
00:05:19,033 --> 00:05:20,753
Last I checked, it was...

59
00:05:21,452 --> 00:05:22,646
Wait. I remember!

60
00:05:23,005 --> 00:05:26,405
The dog! Jotaro grabbed the dog, which means he knows!

61
00:05:26,438 --> 00:05:28,364
I've finally figured you out, mutt.

62
00:05:28,524 --> 00:05:31,390
I know you jumped out of the
car before the stand attacked it.

63
00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:33,516
You can smell it, can't you?

64
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:35,648
You know where it's gonna be before it gets there.

65
00:05:38,681 --> 00:05:41,140
Gah! Don't stop moving, Jotaro!

66
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:44,251
Now, Iggy, I think it's time for you to earn your keep.

67
00:05:45,447 --> 00:05:48,283
Where's the stand coming from? Just show me, already.

68
00:05:48,687 --> 00:05:50,255
Show me, or we die,

69
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,304
and how would you get your gum then?

70
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:03,420
Huh?

71
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:10,899
Iggy!

72
00:06:12,252 --> 00:06:13,582
You've gotta be kidding me.

73
00:06:13,614 --> 00:06:16,168
He can fly, too? Not so fast.

74
00:06:20,058 --> 00:06:21,804
Go ahead, and pant all you want.

75
00:06:21,986 --> 00:06:23,615
You're not getting out of this one.

76
00:06:23,995 --> 00:06:26,260
Star platinum's as fast as they come.

77
00:06:26,707 --> 00:06:28,192
If you're thinking of dropping me,

78
00:06:28,217 --> 00:06:30,384
I'll snap your neck before you can blink.

79
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:32,864
What?

80
00:06:33,047 --> 00:06:35,401
It's like he jumped and suddenly disappeared.

81
00:06:35,707 --> 00:06:37,242
This is impossible.

82
00:06:37,315 --> 00:06:39,281
They must have landed somewhere.

83
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:42,232
That's brilliant.

84
00:06:42,862 --> 00:06:46,139
We can't move around, so to bypass that handicap,

85
00:06:46,251 --> 00:06:48,907
Jotaro's using Iggy to find the stand user.

86
00:06:48,994 --> 00:06:51,351
If we can find whoever's controlling the stand,

87
00:06:51,378 --> 00:06:53,908
we might actually have a chance of defeating him.

88
00:06:55,632 --> 00:06:56,885
He's vanished.

89
00:06:56,934 --> 00:06:59,329
I can't hear Jotaro's footsteps.

90
00:06:59,468 --> 00:07:01,516
Where is he? Where did he go?

91
00:07:01,541 --> 00:07:03,558
Why can't I hear his footsteps?

92
00:07:05,729 --> 00:07:07,579
Oh, no. They're flying lower and lower.

93
00:07:09,561 --> 00:07:11,084
This isn't gonna end well.

94
00:07:11,109 --> 00:07:13,644
It looks like the fool can't travel long distances.

95
00:07:13,784 --> 00:07:16,235
The damn thing is gliding like a paper airplane!

96
00:07:17,923 --> 00:07:19,998
My legs are about to touch the ground.

97
00:07:21,064 --> 00:07:21,899
Hey, mutt,

98
00:07:21,924 --> 00:07:23,310
quit tensing up like that.

99
00:07:23,335 --> 00:07:24,728
You're starting to fart again.

100
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:28,498
For your sake, you better not let out a big one.

101
00:07:30,278 --> 00:07:31,299
No choice.

102
00:07:31,656 --> 00:07:33,049
We need to get more air,

103
00:07:33,527 --> 00:07:35,833
and at this point, there's only one way to do it.

104
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:40,632
Ora!

105
00:07:43,845 --> 00:07:46,957
That kick got us a lot closer to our destination for sure,

106
00:07:47,477 --> 00:07:50,110
but the sound of it definitely gave away our strategy.

107
00:07:50,998 --> 00:07:53,812
Now the user will know that
we're flying to avoid detection.

108
00:07:53,888 --> 00:07:56,681
So that's why I wasn't able to locate them.

109
00:07:56,715 --> 00:07:59,318
The dog's stand has the ability to fly.

110
00:07:59,545 --> 00:08:01,566
But now I know what they're up to.

111
00:08:01,799 --> 00:08:03,681
They're headed directly for me.

112
00:08:03,926 --> 00:08:07,138
I have to eliminate Jotaro before he gets any closer!

113
00:08:08,906 --> 00:08:11,597
His stand's on the move, and it's going after Jotaro!

114
00:08:11,648 --> 00:08:13,889
He figured it out when Jotaro kicked off!

115
00:08:15,349 --> 00:08:17,128
There's nothing we can do about it.

116
00:08:17,548 --> 00:08:20,838
The only thing we can do now is trust Jotaro.

117
00:08:22,302 --> 00:08:23,342
He's coming.

118
00:08:24,065 --> 00:08:26,377
I know he was able to bring down a helicopter,

119
00:08:26,743 --> 00:08:30,960
but he shouldn't be able to find our exact
location since Iggy's stand barely makes a sound.

120
00:08:31,753 --> 00:08:35,598
I just have to get to the stand user
before landing, and it'll be lights out.

121
00:08:44,835 --> 00:08:45,739
There he is.

122
00:08:46,848 --> 00:08:49,448
The stand user's about 400 meters away.

123
00:08:53,986 --> 00:08:56,986
And from the looks of things, our enemy is blind.

124
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,200
Damn it. Sand's falling from the sky.

125
00:09:04,126 --> 00:09:07,578
Of course. The stand user must be trying to find us.

126
00:09:07,891 --> 00:09:11,579
He's using the sand bouncing off
the wings like a submarine uses sonar.

127
00:09:15,091 --> 00:09:18,039
Because of the falling sand, I can hear you now.

128
00:09:22,325 --> 00:09:26,728
And I've discovered your exact location, Jotaro!

129
00:09:41,846 --> 00:09:43,487
Time to die!

130
00:09:43,512 --> 00:09:45,033
Star platinum!

131
00:09:45,975 --> 00:09:46,942
Ora!

132
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:52,703
Star platinum's speed won't be of much use, I'm afraid!

133
00:09:52,918 --> 00:09:57,195
If you can't tell where my attack is
coming from, then my stand has the advantage!

134
00:10:00,036 --> 00:10:01,421
Here comes another!

135
00:10:05,743 --> 00:10:06,942
Iggy...

136
00:10:07,705 --> 00:10:09,162
Iggy...

137
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:12,595
Shit.

138
00:10:12,830 --> 00:10:13,949
You damn mutt!

139
00:10:15,867 --> 00:10:19,854
What a dog! He's dragging Jotaro right into my trap!

140
00:10:19,939 --> 00:10:22,511
It seems like he'll do anything to save his own hide!

141
00:10:23,631 --> 00:10:25,727
Even abandon his master!

142
00:10:28,185 --> 00:10:29,106
Bastard.

143
00:10:29,428 --> 00:10:30,882
Just you wait.

144
00:10:31,462 --> 00:10:35,567
That's what you get for relying
on such a fickle creature, Jotaro.

145
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:37,807
Your end has come,

146
00:10:38,208 --> 00:10:40,175
and now it's finally time

147
00:10:40,405 --> 00:10:42,607
to put you out of your misery.

148
00:10:47,770 --> 00:10:50,077
O...

149
00:10:51,404 --> 00:10:52,478
Ora!

150
00:10:55,111 --> 00:10:56,028
What's this?

151
00:10:56,053 --> 00:10:57,983
It feels like he just threw something at me!

152
00:10:58,282 --> 00:11:00,457
I can't make out what it is at that speed.

153
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:04,152
I tossed Iggy at you. Get a move on.

154
00:11:04,256 --> 00:11:09,893
You'd better use your stand to defend yourselves, or else
you two are gonna be closer than you ever wanted to be.

155
00:11:09,918 --> 00:11:11,961
Such insane velocity.

156
00:11:15,196 --> 00:11:16,681
Damn it! It's going to hit me!

157
00:11:23,202 --> 00:11:24,448
I can't believe it.

158
00:11:24,473 --> 00:11:26,239
He actually threw the dog.

159
00:11:27,696 --> 00:11:31,589
Blast it! I was so close to putting
an end to that wretch once and for all.

160
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:33,838
Huh?

161
00:11:36,773 --> 00:11:39,945
No. I was so busy worrying about that damn dog,

162
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:42,032
I completely lost Jotaro's location.

163
00:11:43,415 --> 00:11:45,708
Where? Where is he?

164
00:11:48,579 --> 00:11:52,060
It's like he vanished, and he's staying absolutely still.

165
00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:54,866
That must have been his plan.

166
00:11:55,930 --> 00:11:57,550
Where the hell are you?

167
00:11:58,055 --> 00:11:59,827
You can't hide forever.

168
00:12:00,168 --> 00:12:03,383
Show yourself, Jotaro!

169
00:12:06,685 --> 00:12:07,851
I'm right here.

170
00:12:20,187 --> 00:12:21,280
I see.

171
00:12:22,804 --> 00:12:25,361
I didn't realize you'd slink so close.

172
00:12:25,741 --> 00:12:29,367
If I hadn't had the foresight to
protect myself with this water shield,

173
00:12:29,392 --> 00:12:31,761
you would have already knocked me out from behind.

174
00:12:32,010 --> 00:12:35,907
I suppose I should count myself
lucky it makes for such a good defense.

175
00:12:36,228 --> 00:12:40,777
Given that we're now in such close proximity,
I no longer need this cane to hear you.

176
00:12:41,612 --> 00:12:46,180
However, I will require its use when I return home.

177
00:12:58,410 --> 00:13:00,142
Iggy. Iggy.

178
00:13:05,296 --> 00:13:06,476
Iggy.

179
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:13,713
Iggy. Iggy. Iggy.

180
00:13:15,733 --> 00:13:17,052
Iggy!

181
00:13:18,723 --> 00:13:20,074
Ora!

182
00:13:42,705 --> 00:13:46,524
It's hard to believe, but you
actually managed to knock off my hat.

183
00:13:46,824 --> 00:13:49,743
You can relax a little. I was holding back.

184
00:13:49,873 --> 00:13:51,440
You're not going to die.

185
00:13:56,219 --> 00:13:56,960
What the?!

186
00:13:57,068 --> 00:13:58,907
Why the hell would you use your stand to...

187
00:13:58,963 --> 00:14:01,537
Explain. Why did you do it?!

188
00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:04,263
Jotaro...

189
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:06,639
You... you thought you could...

190
00:14:07,113 --> 00:14:08,580
You thought you could manipulate me

191
00:14:08,612 --> 00:14:13,232
and force me to tell you information
regarding the other eight stand users, didn't you?

192
00:14:14,681 --> 00:14:16,236
I'm very well aware...

193
00:14:16,915 --> 00:14:19,216
That Joseph Joestar's hermit purple...

194
00:14:19,306 --> 00:14:21,444
Can view into the minds of others.

195
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:24,597
You'll never get inside my head,

196
00:14:25,097 --> 00:14:28,973
and I'll never tell you anything
that you could use against my master.

197
00:14:30,846 --> 00:14:31,733
Dio.

198
00:14:32,138 --> 00:14:34,598
I don't understand why you're so loyal to him.

199
00:14:34,765 --> 00:14:38,235
Are you honestly telling me that you'd die for him?

200
00:14:38,626 --> 00:14:40,996
Jotaro, you're right.

201
00:14:41,163 --> 00:14:42,438
You don't understand.

202
00:14:42,757 --> 00:14:45,346
Fear of death holds no place in my heart.

203
00:14:47,655 --> 00:14:49,653
Because of the power of my stand,

204
00:14:50,053 --> 00:14:55,128
I've always been able to live a life unencumbered
by such inconsequential fears like death.

205
00:14:55,536 --> 00:14:57,891
I could always win any fight.

206
00:14:58,163 --> 00:15:00,875
I could have and do whatever I wanted.

207
00:15:02,014 --> 00:15:05,387
Killing and stealing were absolutely meaningless to me.

208
00:15:06,462 --> 00:15:08,453
You should talk to the mutt about it.

209
00:15:08,535 --> 00:15:10,613
I'm sure he knows how I feel.

210
00:15:11,379 --> 00:15:13,167
Dio was the first person

211
00:15:13,253 --> 00:15:16,653
who was able to look deep within
my soul and find something more.

212
00:15:16,899 --> 00:15:19,689
He was the one who gave me a desire to live.

213
00:15:20,989 --> 00:15:23,222
That glorious force of nature...

214
00:15:23,353 --> 00:15:27,552
He was so strong, so wise, so beautiful.

215
00:15:28,178 --> 00:15:33,385
He was the one and only person in my
life to ever see a purpose for my existence.

216
00:15:37,226 --> 00:15:41,418
I waited such a long time for an opportunity to meet him.

217
00:15:42,938 --> 00:15:45,352
I will gladly die for my master's sake.

218
00:15:46,164 --> 00:15:49,550
But no matter what, I refuse to do
anything that would disappoint him.

219
00:15:51,645 --> 00:15:54,410
And after all, evil or not,

220
00:15:54,435 --> 00:15:56,925
a scoundrel needs someone to put his faith in.

221
00:16:00,335 --> 00:16:02,282
I'll tell you this before I go.

222
00:16:02,948 --> 00:16:05,401
You should know that my name is N'doul,

223
00:16:05,494 --> 00:16:09,287
and my stand hails from Egypt,
the birthplace of the tarot.

224
00:16:09,663 --> 00:16:14,074
It's referred to as one of the nine
gods of Egypt, Geb of the great ennead.

225
00:16:15,733 --> 00:16:17,933
We call it the god of the earth.

226
00:16:18,451 --> 00:16:19,912
Nine Egyptian gods?

227
00:16:20,211 --> 00:16:21,325
What does that mean?!

228
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:25,348
Sorry, but I'll only tell you about my stand.

229
00:16:26,514 --> 00:16:29,787
It's only fair, since you're
the one who ended up stopping me.

230
00:16:29,869 --> 00:16:33,224
But info on my compatriots goes with me to my grave.

231
00:17:07,606 --> 00:17:10,213
Dio brainwashes people like a cult leader.

232
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,725
Just who is this guy, exactly?

233
00:17:13,516 --> 00:17:16,115
And what's this crap about the nine gods of Egypt?

234
00:17:16,681 --> 00:17:18,053
It's all a mystery...

235
00:17:18,546 --> 00:17:21,030
But for now, we just have to keep moving forward.

236
00:17:26,294 --> 00:17:28,003
Hey, you don't have to be defensive.

237
00:17:28,062 --> 00:17:30,016
It's not like I'm angry with you or anything.

238
00:17:30,194 --> 00:17:31,796
Makes sense you'd be pissed.

239
00:17:32,057 --> 00:17:36,345
I doubt you wanted to be dragged out into
the desert and forced into some human crap.

240
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:38,435
Your position must suck ass.

241
00:17:38,754 --> 00:17:40,726
No one can blame you for being upset.

242
00:17:41,872 --> 00:17:44,016
Iggy, here. You want some gum?

243
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:51,036
Would you calm down already?
I'm trying to apologize.

244
00:17:51,382 --> 00:17:52,116
Take it.

245
00:17:54,899 --> 00:17:55,979
Good grief.

246
00:17:56,045 --> 00:17:57,923
That dog is a pain in the ass.

247
00:17:58,167 --> 00:18:00,755
You can stay out here in the desert for all I care.

248
00:18:02,783 --> 00:18:03,770
Iggy.

249
00:18:03,794 --> 00:18:04,261
Hmm?

250
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:09,339
Huh. Well, what do you know?

251
00:18:09,419 --> 00:18:11,241
You went back and fetched my hat for me.

252
00:18:15,093 --> 00:18:16,995
Maybe you're not so bad after all.

253
00:18:18,408 --> 00:18:19,099
Thanks.

254
00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:28,185
You put gum in here?

255
00:18:28,773 --> 00:18:30,093
You good-for-nothing, little...

256
00:18:30,786 --> 00:18:32,520
You're no ordinary mutt.

257
00:18:32,565 --> 00:18:33,972
Hey!

258
00:18:34,347 --> 00:18:35,652
Jotaro!

259
00:18:36,029 --> 00:18:36,398
Huh?

260
00:18:36,422 --> 00:18:37,415
Jotaro!

261
00:18:37,495 --> 00:18:38,964
Are you all right?

262
00:18:45,796 --> 00:18:46,849
Good grief.

263
00:20:25,752 --> 00:20:29,236
Ah, sweet! Hey, there. Is that a
comic book you're reading, little man?

264
00:20:29,282 --> 00:20:30,676
I've never seen one here.

265
00:20:30,701 --> 00:20:33,202
So Egyptians read comics just like the rest of us.

266
00:20:33,627 --> 00:20:34,922
You want some mini doughnuts?

267
00:20:37,910 --> 00:20:39,749
Hey, mind if I see your comic book?

268
00:20:39,853 --> 00:20:42,226
If you'll let me, I promise I'll be super careful with it.

269
00:20:42,355 --> 00:20:44,875
I'm a comic book artist who's searching for inspiration.

270
00:20:45,005 --> 00:20:48,642
Nothing gets me jazzed up more than
checking out rare books and comics.

271
00:20:48,678 --> 00:20:51,266
Let me borrow it, and you can use my binoculars.

272
00:20:51,701 --> 00:20:52,252
Hmm?

273
00:20:52,550 --> 00:20:54,607
What the? How peculiar.

274
00:20:54,632 --> 00:20:57,391
The story's about these two eerie-looking brothers?

275
00:20:57,838 --> 00:20:59,421
I don't see the creator's name.

276
00:21:01,241 --> 00:21:02,127
Wow!

277
00:21:02,268 --> 00:21:04,487
These are all such bizarre drawings.

278
00:21:04,744 --> 00:21:08,152
But this is fantastic print quality,
not to mention it's in full color!

279
00:21:08,594 --> 00:21:11,559
"There once lived two brothers who got along very well."

280
00:21:12,338 --> 00:21:13,725
"'My name is Zenyatta.'"

281
00:21:13,831 --> 00:21:15,539
"'My name is Mondatta.'"

282
00:21:15,949 --> 00:21:18,747
"Mondatta, the younger brother, was very shy"

283
00:21:18,772 --> 00:21:21,562
"and wouldn't do anything unless Zenyatta was with him."

284
00:21:21,587 --> 00:21:23,110
"He was always alone."

285
00:21:24,558 --> 00:21:27,486
"One day, while his big brother Zenyatta was away,

286
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:30,521
"Mondatta met a kind traveler near the side of the road.

287
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:35,084
"He gave Mondatta yummy snacks
and let him use his binoculars.

288
00:21:35,109 --> 00:21:37,961
Mondatta had more fun than he'd had in a long time."

289
00:21:37,986 --> 00:21:39,407
"'Oh, it's 10:30!'"

290
00:21:39,939 --> 00:21:43,119
"But unfortunately the very kind traveler

291
00:21:43,602 --> 00:21:47,361
was impaled on a telephone
pole and died a horrific death."

292
00:21:48,276 --> 00:21:49,877
Quite a weird comic you've got.

293
00:21:50,437 --> 00:21:53,164
Is this comic especially popular in this place?

294
00:21:53,579 --> 00:21:55,525
If you ask me, it's really strange.

295
00:21:55,935 --> 00:21:57,729
The other pages are all blank.

296
00:21:58,071 --> 00:21:59,861
It's like they forgot to print the rest.

297
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:01,419
Must be a dud.

298
00:22:03,229 --> 00:22:07,461
But somehow I feel as though I have a
connection to it. It's totally pulled me in.

299
00:22:08,059 --> 00:22:11,582
This is gonna sound crazy, but would it be
possible for me to buy this book from you?

300
00:22:11,607 --> 00:22:12,835
It's not for sale!

301
00:22:12,859 --> 00:22:13,319
Huh?

302
00:22:13,526 --> 00:22:14,928
Are you deaf or somethin'?

303
00:22:14,953 --> 00:22:16,869
My bro's book's not for sale!

304
00:22:17,496 --> 00:22:19,013
Now get out of my sight.

305
00:22:19,312 --> 00:22:20,684
This kid is your brother?

306
00:22:20,709 --> 00:22:22,426
I won't tell you again!

307
00:22:26,998 --> 00:22:29,844
Hey, what have I told you about talking to strangers?

308
00:22:30,110 --> 00:22:33,117
There's lots of bad people roaming
the world these days, you know?

309
00:22:33,467 --> 00:22:34,631
Last call!

310
00:22:34,881 --> 00:22:37,601
The bus for Aswan is getting ready to depart!

311
00:22:38,099 --> 00:22:39,065
That's us.

312
00:22:39,653 --> 00:22:44,192
They're on their way to the hospital in Aswan to
drop off their friend and have his injuries treated.

313
00:22:44,804 --> 00:22:45,299
Hmm?

314
00:22:46,987 --> 00:22:49,324
Ah. You don't say?

315
00:22:49,510 --> 00:22:50,773
If that's how it is,

316
00:22:50,831 --> 00:22:53,181
we'll just have to wait for the next bus.
