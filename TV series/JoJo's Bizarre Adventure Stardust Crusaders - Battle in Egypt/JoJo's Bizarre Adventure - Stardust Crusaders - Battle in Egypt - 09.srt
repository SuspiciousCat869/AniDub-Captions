1
00:00:01,634 --> 00:00:04,426
Previously on "Jojo's Bizarre Adventure"...

2
00:00:09,004 --> 00:00:09,717
What the?!

3
00:00:09,751 --> 00:00:11,971
Why am I a kid?!

4
00:00:12,103 --> 00:00:13,678
Pami!

5
00:00:14,012 --> 00:00:16,145
Little boy, are you all right there?

6
00:00:16,378 --> 00:00:19,129
I'll clean those wounds up and put some medicine on you.

7
00:00:24,883 --> 00:00:26,811
That's impossible!

8
00:00:27,419 --> 00:00:28,503
Chariot, help!

9
00:00:31,824 --> 00:00:33,615
Yes! Yes!

10
00:00:45,135 --> 00:00:47,327
I'm not strong enough to beat him like this.

11
00:00:48,633 --> 00:00:48,893
Pami!

12
00:00:48,918 --> 00:00:51,080
I don't see that nice lady anywhere.

13
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:54,203
Where'd she go? She couldn't have just vanished.

14
00:00:54,228 --> 00:00:55,923
She was sitting right behind me.

15
00:00:56,262 --> 00:00:59,370
I didn't even hear a scream. What'd he do to her?

16
00:01:01,807 --> 00:01:03,333
Where could she have gone?!

17
00:01:03,375 --> 00:01:05,773
Oh, Polnareff...

18
00:01:07,347 --> 00:01:11,038
As I recall, you said the shampoo stings your eyes,

19
00:01:11,063 --> 00:01:13,649
and since it looks like you've got some in there...

20
00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:20,349
Allow me to help you wash it out!

21
00:01:20,686 --> 00:01:23,048
Now this won't take long.

22
00:03:02,505 --> 00:03:03,585
C'est mauvais!

23
00:03:03,643 --> 00:03:06,770
Having pint-sized arms is gonna wind up getting me killed!

24
00:03:06,831 --> 00:03:09,997
If only these stupid arms of
mine were just a little longer,

25
00:03:10,035 --> 00:03:12,785
I'd be able to poke his eyes out and make a run for it.

26
00:03:15,992 --> 00:03:19,010
So, even in the face of death,
you thought to pull the plug!

27
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:20,876
However...

28
00:03:26,373 --> 00:03:31,843
With your hair clogging the water's only exit,
it'll take even longer for the tub to completely drain.

29
00:03:31,868 --> 00:03:34,629
I'd say you have five, maybe 10 minutes left.

30
00:03:38,034 --> 00:03:40,265
You may as well throw in the towel now.

31
00:03:41,026 --> 00:03:43,391
You're going down for a permanent nap!

32
00:03:43,486 --> 00:03:46,561
Good night! Horrid dreams, you little brat!

33
00:03:47,674 --> 00:03:49,849
Now die!

34
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:55,062
How does it feel knowing that
you're utterly helpless, Polnareff?

35
00:04:07,377 --> 00:04:08,010
Hmm?

36
00:04:08,616 --> 00:04:10,496
W-What the hell is that thing?

37
00:04:11,722 --> 00:04:12,770
It can't be!

38
00:04:12,795 --> 00:04:14,823
But from the shape and color, it looks like...

39
00:04:15,103 --> 00:04:16,087
There's no way!

40
00:04:16,447 --> 00:04:20,684
No one in their right mind would think
of doing something so downright disgusting!

41
00:04:26,055 --> 00:04:28,815
It's undeniable! The smell proves it!

42
00:04:29,075 --> 00:04:30,725
Ugh! How foul!

43
00:04:31,178 --> 00:04:33,325
You took a shit in the bathtub!

44
00:04:37,547 --> 00:04:39,442
Guess I'm not so helpless after all,

45
00:04:39,701 --> 00:04:41,706
you creepy, four-eyed asshole!

46
00:04:42,113 --> 00:04:44,155
How dare you do something like that?!

47
00:04:44,314 --> 00:04:48,633
Dear god! Isn't there a shred
of human decency in your body?!

48
00:04:48,747 --> 00:04:52,322
What kind of hero would ever stoop
to doing something so disturbing?!

49
00:04:52,524 --> 00:04:55,413
You are a bad boy, very bad!

50
00:04:55,446 --> 00:04:57,924
Shut up, and tell me what you did to that nice lady!

51
00:04:57,967 --> 00:04:59,493
I wanna know right now!

52
00:05:00,392 --> 00:05:01,439
Where are you?

53
00:05:02,179 --> 00:05:03,241
Where'd you go?!

54
00:05:03,431 --> 00:05:05,385
Lady, answer me!

55
00:05:06,349 --> 00:05:07,422
Hey, lady!

56
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:12,067
Come on. You that stupid?

57
00:05:12,807 --> 00:05:14,533
What do you think I did?

58
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:15,946
Whoa, there!

59
00:05:15,979 --> 00:05:19,453
It'd be wise for both of us to
watch where we step, Polnareff.

60
00:05:19,925 --> 00:05:24,065
One wrong move, and your lady friend
is likely to be squashed underfoot.

61
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:24,668
Huh?

62
00:05:36,871 --> 00:05:38,433
He... he wouldn't.

63
00:05:38,835 --> 00:05:42,284
There's no way. This can't be happening.

64
00:05:45,477 --> 00:05:47,384
No, it can't be.

65
00:05:47,641 --> 00:05:51,472
Anyone who's unfortunate enough
to come into contact with my stand

66
00:05:51,594 --> 00:05:54,005
experiences time in reverse.

67
00:05:54,065 --> 00:05:58,690
Luckily for you, you saw me coming and
jumped away from my shadow at the last second,

68
00:05:58,795 --> 00:06:01,634
buying yourself a few more
years than your friend down there,

69
00:06:01,751 --> 00:06:05,855
but she had the misfortune of
touching my shadow for several seconds,

70
00:06:05,948 --> 00:06:08,441
which is the reason she became a fetus!

71
00:06:10,938 --> 00:06:12,843
She's alive for the time being,

72
00:06:12,903 --> 00:06:14,473
but, if I'm being honest with you,

73
00:06:14,544 --> 00:06:18,136
she won't last long outside
the safety of her mother's womb.

74
00:06:19,193 --> 00:06:20,253
That's what she gets!

75
00:06:20,339 --> 00:06:23,750
She should have never tried to help
a pathetic piece of trash like you!

76
00:06:23,914 --> 00:06:25,256
What a moron.

77
00:06:28,082 --> 00:06:31,159
You are the worst kind of person on this planet!

78
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:40,401
Crap! You gotta be kidding me. I just...

79
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:46,100
Oops! Looks like you touched it again,

80
00:06:46,412 --> 00:06:48,787
which means you're going to get even younger.

81
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:53,556
This time, you'll probably regress to a
diminutive four-year-old version of yourself.

82
00:06:53,641 --> 00:06:54,796
Not again!

83
00:06:59,088 --> 00:07:00,201
This isn't good.

84
00:07:00,561 --> 00:07:02,436
I have to hurry and beat this guy,

85
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:04,156
or the nice lady will...

86
00:07:05,026 --> 00:07:05,953
At this rate,

87
00:07:06,087 --> 00:07:08,979
she only has a matter of minutes before she dies!

88
00:07:09,229 --> 00:07:11,882
I've gotta find a way to defeat this Alessi freak,

89
00:07:11,907 --> 00:07:13,426
and I've gotta do it fast!

90
00:07:17,143 --> 00:07:19,673
She took me in and fixed up all my wounds.

91
00:07:19,888 --> 00:07:21,213
She was so caring.

92
00:07:22,015 --> 00:07:23,190
I have to hurry!

93
00:07:23,464 --> 00:07:25,633
There's absolutely no time to waste.

94
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,351
Come here, little boy!

95
00:07:27,383 --> 00:07:28,770
Come here! Come here!

96
00:07:30,403 --> 00:07:32,116
Get over here, will you?!

97
00:07:32,223 --> 00:07:34,231
Where exactly do you think you're going?

98
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:37,013
You're not gonna get far cradling a dying fetus!

99
00:07:37,338 --> 00:07:38,936
Here's a fun idea.

100
00:07:39,136 --> 00:07:41,200
Let's turn you into a fetus!

101
00:07:42,786 --> 00:07:44,272
Damn it. Not this again!

102
00:07:44,352 --> 00:07:46,552
His dumb shadow keeps touching me!

103
00:07:50,093 --> 00:07:52,528
Oh, no! I'm getting even smaller!

104
00:07:52,633 --> 00:07:53,614
Yahoo!

105
00:07:53,814 --> 00:07:55,058
Oh, boy!

106
00:07:55,083 --> 00:07:57,493
There's no way in hell I'm gonna lose now!

107
00:07:57,578 --> 00:07:59,421
Judging from your appearance, Polnareff,

108
00:07:59,495 --> 00:08:01,610
you're what, three years old now?

109
00:08:01,683 --> 00:08:05,584
Before you know it, your intellect will
be that of a three-year-old's as well.

110
00:08:18,978 --> 00:08:21,693
Locking the door won't do you any good, little one.

111
00:08:30,276 --> 00:08:31,016
Made it.

112
00:08:31,125 --> 00:08:34,400
Huh? Damn it. The stupid bars are too close together!

113
00:08:35,126 --> 00:08:36,979
Even a kid can't slip through.

114
00:08:38,238 --> 00:08:43,508
But I have to find a way to get out of here,
or that freak show's gonna kill us both! Crap!

115
00:08:46,683 --> 00:08:48,203
I-I can't cut them.

116
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:53,081
This is just too good to be true.

117
00:08:53,127 --> 00:08:55,816
I see that your chariot has also become a toddler.

118
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:58,542
The bars are too tough for its baby rapier.

119
00:08:58,593 --> 00:09:00,448
I bet it's gotten slower, too.

120
00:09:02,235 --> 00:09:05,009
Ready or not, here I come.

121
00:09:21,388 --> 00:09:25,128
Oh, Polnareff, here comes Alessi!

122
00:09:25,481 --> 00:09:26,435
Huh?

123
00:09:31,384 --> 00:09:32,913
H-he's gone.

124
00:09:32,954 --> 00:09:35,321
Huh? Where did he go?

125
00:09:35,403 --> 00:09:38,426
That brat. He just vanished.

126
00:09:38,807 --> 00:09:43,107
Or maybe the little spunk monkey found a
way to slither through the bars in the window.

127
00:09:47,041 --> 00:09:49,794
Clever, Polnareff. Very clever.

128
00:09:49,851 --> 00:09:52,204
You're trying to pull a fast one, aren't you?

129
00:09:52,890 --> 00:09:57,105
You think if you trick me into believing you
slipped through the window, it'll distract me.

130
00:09:57,150 --> 00:10:00,402
You must be hiding somewhere,
waiting to get the drop on me.

131
00:10:02,073 --> 00:10:03,750
Not bad, runt.

132
00:10:04,237 --> 00:10:07,598
Quite cunning indeed, for a miserable little shit!

133
00:10:07,844 --> 00:10:11,173
Polnareff, come out, come out, wherever you are.

134
00:10:12,874 --> 00:10:17,284
You're so puny now, you could easily
be hiding in that drawer over there.

135
00:10:17,489 --> 00:10:21,315
Yeah, he's probably hiding in the bucket or the drawer,

136
00:10:21,362 --> 00:10:25,368
or maybe he's actually hiding
in that Teddy bear by the wall.

137
00:10:27,616 --> 00:10:29,017
Oh, where could he be?

138
00:10:29,090 --> 00:10:30,990
I've got a one-in-three chance.

139
00:10:31,383 --> 00:10:34,709
And, if at all possible, I'd
like to get him with one swing.

140
00:10:34,742 --> 00:10:37,800
I'll crack open his infantile skull with this ax!

141
00:10:42,937 --> 00:10:46,908
I've decided you're tucking away
in that tattered, old Teddy bear!

142
00:10:47,892 --> 00:10:50,153
But my second guess is...

143
00:10:50,273 --> 00:10:51,881
This grandfather clock,

144
00:10:51,995 --> 00:10:54,041
the perfect hiding spot for a coward!

145
00:10:57,818 --> 00:11:00,182
I guess I was wrong.

146
00:11:01,570 --> 00:11:03,371
Then maybe he's...

147
00:11:03,396 --> 00:11:05,669
Hiding in this rusty bucket!

148
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,230
But I...

149
00:11:10,214 --> 00:11:12,207
So you are in the bear!

150
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,590
Then how about the drawer?!

151
00:11:17,695 --> 00:11:18,741
Where is he?!

152
00:11:18,862 --> 00:11:20,988
Where is he?! Where is he?! Where is he?! Where is he?!

153
00:11:21,022 --> 00:11:22,342
Where is he?!

154
00:11:23,305 --> 00:11:25,798
H-he's gone! But how?

155
00:11:26,104 --> 00:11:28,671
There's no way he could have gotten out of here!

156
00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:31,461
The walls, floor, and ceiling are all stone.

157
00:11:31,485 --> 00:11:34,858
Even if they were one centimeter
thick, chariot couldn't break through.

158
00:11:34,951 --> 00:11:36,858
And those bars are too narrow for him.

159
00:11:36,917 --> 00:11:38,557
I saw it with my own eyes.

160
00:11:38,793 --> 00:11:40,930
This is insane. Where is he?

161
00:11:40,975 --> 00:11:42,420
Where did he go?

162
00:11:45,479 --> 00:11:46,030
Huh?

163
00:11:46,489 --> 00:11:49,450
So you were outsmarted by a toddler, huh...

164
00:11:49,475 --> 00:11:50,029
What the...

165
00:11:50,382 --> 00:11:52,695
Old man Alessi.

166
00:12:02,376 --> 00:12:03,736
What's going on here?

167
00:12:03,783 --> 00:12:05,633
The goldfish just disappeared.

168
00:12:08,536 --> 00:12:09,029
Huh?

169
00:12:26,894 --> 00:12:29,220
I was hiding in the fish tank the whole time

170
00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:31,733
and used this mirror for camouflage.

171
00:12:31,758 --> 00:12:35,354
A kid could have figured out my
plan, and you totally fell for it!

172
00:12:35,429 --> 00:12:38,299
I was worried that something so simple wasn't gonna work,

173
00:12:38,336 --> 00:12:41,279
but lucky for me, you're just as stupid as you are creepy!

174
00:12:44,024 --> 00:12:46,576
It doesn't matter if chariot's
stuck in his two-year-old form.

175
00:12:46,632 --> 00:12:48,996
He can still skewer your face, dumb-ass!

176
00:12:56,844 --> 00:12:59,337
Bad boy! Bad boy!

177
00:12:59,506 --> 00:13:01,241
Hey, get your ass back here!

178
00:13:01,266 --> 00:13:01,840
Pami!

179
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:02,631
Hey, wait!

180
00:13:02,697 --> 00:13:05,719
Until you break your stand's
spell, I'm gonna keep attacking!

181
00:13:07,475 --> 00:13:09,438
Bad boy! Bad boy!

182
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:12,327
You're such a bad boy!

183
00:13:12,527 --> 00:13:13,315
Of all the...

184
00:13:13,494 --> 00:13:15,490
That jerk jumped out the window!

185
00:13:19,453 --> 00:13:22,288
Bad boy. What a horrible boy.

186
00:13:22,313 --> 00:13:22,773
Eh?

187
00:13:27,023 --> 00:13:28,303
Jotaro.

188
00:13:28,476 --> 00:13:31,997
Crap. If he's here, then I'm done for.

189
00:13:32,232 --> 00:13:34,283
How'd he find us?

190
00:13:34,495 --> 00:13:35,401
Hmm.

191
00:13:43,944 --> 00:13:46,457
Someone falling from a window, covered in blood.

192
00:13:46,854 --> 00:13:48,310
You don't see that every day.

193
00:13:48,823 --> 00:13:51,160
Stay calm. Stay calm.

194
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:54,349
At times like this, the winner is the one who stays calm.

195
00:13:55,056 --> 00:13:56,678
Just think about it, Alessi.

196
00:13:56,718 --> 00:13:59,654
Jotaro must be looking for the adult version of Polnareff.

197
00:13:59,687 --> 00:14:01,334
He has no clue who I am.

198
00:14:01,987 --> 00:14:03,457
I'll do what I always do,

199
00:14:03,491 --> 00:14:05,022
play dumb until the last minute,

200
00:14:05,102 --> 00:14:07,073
then attack him when he least expects it.

201
00:14:10,665 --> 00:14:12,193
O-oh, no!

202
00:14:12,252 --> 00:14:16,397
My boss is going to be so very
angry with me when he finds out!

203
00:14:16,444 --> 00:14:20,253
There I was cleaning the window, and
I suddenly slipped and fell through!

204
00:14:20,997 --> 00:14:22,643
What am I going to do?

205
00:14:22,677 --> 00:14:25,813
What am I going to do? I am in so much trou...

206
00:14:25,847 --> 00:14:28,371
Hold it right there, you frizzy-haired freak show!

207
00:14:29,993 --> 00:14:31,972
Hey, mister! Uh...

208
00:14:32,418 --> 00:14:33,683
What was his name again?

209
00:14:33,734 --> 00:14:35,147
Come on. What was it?

210
00:14:36,863 --> 00:14:38,023
Now's my chance.

211
00:14:38,103 --> 00:14:41,083
I was waiting for Polnareff to
poke his annoying little head out.

212
00:14:41,201 --> 00:14:43,539
Gotcha now, Jotaro!

213
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:46,006
Mister, watch out for his shadow!

214
00:14:47,935 --> 00:14:49,795
I did it! I really did it.

215
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:52,489
I managed to touch Jotaro's shadow!

216
00:14:52,646 --> 00:14:53,795
Mister, no!

217
00:14:56,316 --> 00:15:00,606
So, Jotaro, how does it feel to be
placed under the spell of my stand?

218
00:15:03,107 --> 00:15:04,593
This feeling...

219
00:15:05,638 --> 00:15:06,784
This is...

220
00:15:07,877 --> 00:15:08,697
This is bad.

221
00:15:08,863 --> 00:15:11,105
He's turning into a kid just like I did!

222
00:15:11,398 --> 00:15:14,288
Oh, Jotaro, I heard through the grapevine

223
00:15:14,354 --> 00:15:17,648
that you've only recently
developed your stand, Star Platinum,

224
00:15:17,765 --> 00:15:22,593
and that means you didn't have the
ability to use your stand when you were a kid,

225
00:15:22,810 --> 00:15:25,352
so now you're nothing but ordinary!

226
00:15:29,901 --> 00:15:30,712
Oh, no!

227
00:15:30,737 --> 00:15:32,621
He's been turned into a little boy!

228
00:15:32,768 --> 00:15:35,902
It looks like he can't be any older than a seven-year-old!

229
00:15:37,671 --> 00:15:38,794
Guess I'm the winner.

230
00:15:38,846 --> 00:15:40,287
Hope you're watching, master Dio,

231
00:15:40,315 --> 00:15:42,267
'cause I'm about to kill Jotaro.

232
00:15:42,364 --> 00:15:45,530
You'd better give me a good reward
for everything I've gone through.

233
00:15:45,679 --> 00:15:49,163
Now, Jotaro, it's time to die!

234
00:15:51,131 --> 00:15:52,428
Whoa, what a hit.

235
00:15:52,552 --> 00:15:54,829
He decked him using only his little-kid fist!

236
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,306
Oh, good grief.

237
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:01,863
Don't underestimate me just 'cause I'm a kid.

238
00:16:07,728 --> 00:16:08,848
Ora! Ora!

239
00:16:08,873 --> 00:16:12,993
Ora!

240
00:16:16,290 --> 00:16:21,007
What?! You're seriously telling me that
Jotaro could kick ass even as a little kid?!

241
00:16:21,395 --> 00:16:22,708
I knew he was tough,

242
00:16:22,743 --> 00:16:25,325
but he was that strong as a kid? Badass!

243
00:16:39,139 --> 00:16:39,870
Huh?

244
00:16:49,470 --> 00:16:52,177
You got off easy, friend, but I can fix that.

245
00:17:05,832 --> 00:17:07,574
Attaboy!

246
00:17:07,598 --> 00:17:10,860
Stand: Set, god of chaos and storms.

247
00:17:10,891 --> 00:17:15,013
Alessi: 38 years old, single
and an unfortunate projectile.

248
00:17:15,407 --> 00:17:16,667
Out of commission!

249
00:17:32,886 --> 00:17:34,478
Was all of that a dream?

250
00:17:41,504 --> 00:17:43,310
This earring belongs to that boy,

251
00:17:44,064 --> 00:17:45,512
so it really did happen.

252
00:17:46,378 --> 00:17:47,581
I don't know why,

253
00:17:47,623 --> 00:17:50,246
but for some reason, I couldn't move my body.

254
00:17:50,984 --> 00:17:51,663
That's right.

255
00:17:52,343 --> 00:17:53,887
I may not have been able to move,

256
00:17:53,921 --> 00:17:55,556
but I remember everything.

257
00:17:56,211 --> 00:17:59,512
That sweet little boy devoted himself to protecting me

258
00:18:00,093 --> 00:18:02,906
and risked his life by fighting against a grown man.

259
00:18:03,405 --> 00:18:05,461
He had such a brave and heroic heart.

260
00:18:05,913 --> 00:18:07,516
Oh, where did that boy go?

261
00:18:08,168 --> 00:18:11,230
Where... where did my little knight run off to?

262
00:18:12,759 --> 00:18:15,155
Where did you go? Where are you?!

263
00:18:18,191 --> 00:18:20,915
I've never met such an amazing woman before,

264
00:18:21,051 --> 00:18:23,373
so kind, so genuine.

265
00:18:24,313 --> 00:18:25,415
That was a close one,

266
00:18:25,445 --> 00:18:27,766
but thankfully I'm back to my normal self.

267
00:18:28,542 --> 00:18:30,254
I wonder if she's okay.

268
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:31,449
Hmm?

269
00:18:36,754 --> 00:18:39,407
Uh, uh, I hate to bother you,

270
00:18:39,467 --> 00:18:43,995
but you didn't happen to see a sweet, little boy
leave my house in something of a hurry, did you?

271
00:18:44,414 --> 00:18:45,708
He has silver hair.

272
00:18:46,383 --> 00:18:48,929
Come to think of it, it looks exactly like yours.

273
00:18:57,846 --> 00:18:59,227
Pardon me for asking,

274
00:18:59,252 --> 00:19:01,241
but have the two of us met before?

275
00:19:06,368 --> 00:19:08,181
No, I didn't see a kid come through.

276
00:19:08,638 --> 00:19:10,103
Sorry I couldn't help you.

277
00:19:10,331 --> 00:19:11,656
Let's go, Jotaro.

278
00:19:14,562 --> 00:19:15,863
Come on. Hurry up.

279
00:19:16,117 --> 00:19:18,378
Uh, wa... please wait!

280
00:19:19,184 --> 00:19:20,064
Could you be...

281
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:22,077
That earring you're wearing...

282
00:19:24,001 --> 00:19:26,100
The two of us have never met before.

283
00:19:26,702 --> 00:19:27,910
It's not possible.

284
00:19:28,563 --> 00:19:32,590
My friend and I are travelers, so if you'll excuse us,

285
00:19:32,723 --> 00:19:34,598
there's another town we need to get to.

286
00:19:35,182 --> 00:19:36,448
We'll be going now.

287
00:19:41,915 --> 00:19:43,435
It was only a dream.

288
00:19:44,198 --> 00:19:45,108
Too bad.

289
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:54,605
Not a single word from you, Jotaro.

290
00:19:54,714 --> 00:19:56,013
I don't wanna hear it.

291
00:20:02,530 --> 00:20:05,509
Oh! Jotaro and Polnareff!

292
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:08,463
Where in the world have you two slackers been?!

293
00:20:08,601 --> 00:20:11,026
Ah! Mr. Joestar and Avdol!

294
00:20:12,027 --> 00:20:15,763
How many times have I told the two of
you not to go wandering off on your own?

295
00:20:15,795 --> 00:20:17,364
Oh, you're in a position to talk!

296
00:20:17,398 --> 00:20:19,258
You're the ones who just disappeared!

297
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:20,260
Eh...

298
00:20:20,303 --> 00:20:21,287
Now, now.

299
00:20:21,408 --> 00:20:23,663
Why don't we focus on getting something to eat?

300
00:20:24,083 --> 00:20:25,393
Huh? Hey, Iggy!

301
00:20:25,463 --> 00:20:27,396
Where the hell have you been all day long?!

302
00:20:40,349 --> 00:20:41,689
Can I take that for you?

303
00:20:44,339 --> 00:20:46,234
Yeah, thanks a million.

304
00:20:47,229 --> 00:20:49,717
Eh, it's about time.

305
00:20:49,751 --> 00:20:51,482
We're finally getting a bit of relief.

306
00:20:51,635 --> 00:20:53,383
It was quite the late breakfast,

307
00:20:53,408 --> 00:20:55,272
but I suppose it couldn't be helped.

308
00:20:55,572 --> 00:20:56,247
Yeah.

309
00:20:56,632 --> 00:20:58,604
Since we've almost made it to Cairo,

310
00:20:58,668 --> 00:21:01,596
I think it's time we figured out where Dio is hiding out.

311
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:05,220
Oh, we're doin' this?

312
00:21:05,493 --> 00:21:06,459
Will it appear?

313
00:21:06,529 --> 00:21:10,925
I'm not sure, but given that we're so
close, the results should be more precise.

314
00:21:11,225 --> 00:21:13,067
All right, here we go!

315
00:21:20,449 --> 00:21:23,066
Excuse me, sir. Is there a problem over here?

316
00:21:23,192 --> 00:21:25,390
Everything's fine. Mind your own business.

317
00:21:25,415 --> 00:21:27,011
Uh, yes, sir.

318
00:21:27,676 --> 00:21:30,019
Hmm.

319
00:21:31,001 --> 00:21:33,918
Old man, tell us. What is it?

320
00:21:34,229 --> 00:21:35,747
Just a little longer.

321
00:21:36,312 --> 00:21:39,874
I see something. It's getting clearer.

322
00:21:41,176 --> 00:21:41,749
Huh?

323
00:21:41,938 --> 00:21:43,162
Take a good look!

324
00:21:45,876 --> 00:21:48,529
There you have it, gentlemen, our final destination!
