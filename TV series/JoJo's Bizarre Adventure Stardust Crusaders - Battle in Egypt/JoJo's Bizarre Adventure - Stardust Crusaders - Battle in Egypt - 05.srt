1
00:00:07,582 --> 00:00:08,235
Hmm?

2
00:00:09,217 --> 00:00:12,129
You did say under the chin, right, Polnareff?

3
00:00:12,307 --> 00:00:13,219
What the hell?!

4
00:00:13,973 --> 00:00:15,719
Remember me, you fool?

5
00:00:15,752 --> 00:00:18,076
I'm the Anubis stand you fought earlier.

6
00:00:22,754 --> 00:00:24,816
Merde! What do I do now?

7
00:00:25,102 --> 00:00:27,995
Goodbye! I'm gonna shave your jaw clean off!

8
00:00:32,433 --> 00:00:32,860
Hmm?

9
00:00:33,459 --> 00:00:35,655
Who... who the hell are you, really?!

10
00:00:36,302 --> 00:00:38,165
And what have you done with the barber?!

11
00:00:43,265 --> 00:00:47,340
Wait. Could it possibly be that
the sword is actually the stand?

12
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:49,450
Could it be controlling the barber?

13
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:53,246
So the guy at Kom Ombo wasn't a real stand user!

14
00:00:53,279 --> 00:00:54,636
Polnareff!

15
00:00:59,279 --> 00:01:01,105
But in the end, it doesn't matter.

16
00:01:01,165 --> 00:01:03,491
I'm still way out of your league, buddy.

17
00:01:09,767 --> 00:01:12,477
What?! How are you so strong?!

18
00:01:12,502 --> 00:01:17,532
If you must know, I took the Liberty of
learning chariot's moves during our last fight.

19
00:01:17,851 --> 00:01:20,212
I won't lose twice to the same adversary.

20
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:22,050
Do you understand me?!

21
00:02:56,223 --> 00:02:57,969
That's it. You can do it.

22
00:02:58,673 --> 00:02:59,814
Ah, come on!

23
00:02:59,859 --> 00:03:00,994
You can't give up now.

24
00:03:01,019 --> 00:03:02,181
You've almost got it!

25
00:03:06,847 --> 00:03:07,436
Oh?

26
00:03:13,532 --> 00:03:15,339
Polnareff and Jotaro,

27
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,218
they should have returned by now.

28
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,674
Polnareff, what's going on?

29
00:03:24,917 --> 00:03:26,460
The barber's a stand user?

30
00:03:26,859 --> 00:03:28,495
Stay back, Jotaro!

31
00:03:29,088 --> 00:03:31,377
Th-the sword is the stand!

32
00:03:32,492 --> 00:03:37,330
Trust me. It's too dangerous to try using
Star Platinum's bare fists against this blade.

33
00:03:37,597 --> 00:03:39,712
The sword's sharp enough to slice through them.

34
00:03:40,165 --> 00:03:42,960
This barber isn't the stand user, he's just a puppet!

35
00:03:44,403 --> 00:03:46,363
And that's not even the worst part!

36
00:03:46,883 --> 00:03:49,496
The stand's even stronger than it was before!

37
00:03:50,809 --> 00:03:52,079
Bastard!

38
00:03:52,784 --> 00:03:53,754
Whoa, there!

39
00:03:58,543 --> 00:03:59,850
Too much for you?

40
00:04:02,183 --> 00:04:05,735
I suppose I should be grateful you've
shown me the limits of your defense.

41
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,935
Most kind of you.

42
00:04:08,607 --> 00:04:12,710
Now, then, let's see if you have
what it takes to survive my next attack,

43
00:04:13,642 --> 00:04:15,452
shall we, Polnareff?

44
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,675
Polnareff!

45
00:04:27,012 --> 00:04:30,049
His powers keep increasing with every strike!

46
00:04:30,586 --> 00:04:32,521
I can't keep parrying forever!

47
00:04:32,751 --> 00:04:34,518
Sooner or later, he's gonna get me!

48
00:04:38,665 --> 00:04:39,187
Huh?

49
00:04:39,331 --> 00:04:39,965
Now!

50
00:04:41,382 --> 00:04:42,602
Take this!

51
00:04:45,083 --> 00:04:46,026
How in the...

52
00:04:48,142 --> 00:04:50,720
In case you haven't realized the obvious,

53
00:04:50,745 --> 00:04:52,604
I know all your moves.

54
00:04:52,945 --> 00:04:55,134
It doesn't matter who my wielder is.

55
00:04:55,159 --> 00:04:58,033
As long as I've done battle with you at least once,

56
00:04:58,824 --> 00:05:00,105
I never, ever,

57
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:02,334
never, ever, never, ever,

58
00:05:02,366 --> 00:05:07,337
never, ever lose twice!

59
00:05:10,327 --> 00:05:12,611
I'm not gonna win this without my rapier.

60
00:05:13,459 --> 00:05:14,206
Oh, no!

61
00:05:14,259 --> 00:05:16,094
Jotaro, help me out here!

62
00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:17,734
Star platinum.

63
00:05:18,551 --> 00:05:19,071
Hmm?

64
00:05:24,137 --> 00:05:25,125
Ora!

65
00:05:27,352 --> 00:05:28,537
Think that finished him off?

66
00:05:28,562 --> 00:05:30,552
No. That punch was shallow,

67
00:05:30,926 --> 00:05:33,469
even though it took just about everything I had.

68
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:34,264
Hey, Khan.

69
00:05:34,288 --> 00:05:35,042
Shit.

70
00:05:35,067 --> 00:05:35,572
Are you all right?

71
00:05:35,596 --> 00:05:36,830
This guy's strong.

72
00:05:37,417 --> 00:05:41,129
It's been quite a while now since
we've seen a stand like this one.

73
00:05:41,154 --> 00:05:42,951
It only relies on strength.

74
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:47,752
Not bad, Star Platinum.

75
00:05:47,845 --> 00:05:49,920
The rumors of your speed were true.

76
00:05:50,712 --> 00:05:55,185
But now that I've seen it, I can easily defeat it.

77
00:06:00,939 --> 00:06:03,034
Hey, Khan, what's wrong with you?

78
00:06:03,349 --> 00:06:04,207
Stay back!

79
00:06:04,444 --> 00:06:06,081
Your friend is being controlled!

80
00:06:06,106 --> 00:06:09,192
If you don't wanna get sliced to
ribbons, go back inside, and hide!

81
00:06:13,653 --> 00:06:15,552
We're in major trouble, Jotaro.

82
00:06:15,675 --> 00:06:18,823
The more we fight this stand, the faster it gets,

83
00:06:20,635 --> 00:06:21,877
and its next attack

84
00:06:21,955 --> 00:06:24,330
will probably be its fastest and strongest yet.

85
00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:27,720
We have to be ready for whatever this
glorified butter knife throws at us!

86
00:06:32,338 --> 00:06:33,576
Move, Polnareff!

87
00:06:33,792 --> 00:06:35,476
I'm the one it's really after!

88
00:06:35,875 --> 00:06:37,615
Get out of there, Jotaro!

89
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:38,646
Die!

90
00:06:38,992 --> 00:06:39,932
Ora!

91
00:06:40,072 --> 00:06:41,209
Ah?!

92
00:06:42,241 --> 00:06:44,329
What? With his bare hands?!

93
00:06:44,417 --> 00:06:46,816
Ora!

94
00:06:49,355 --> 00:06:52,733
Amazing. For him to take that great of a risk...

95
00:06:53,927 --> 00:06:56,292
Now it's become abundantly clear.

96
00:06:56,642 --> 00:07:00,797
The true source of Star Platinum's
strength isn't its speed or precision.

97
00:07:00,966 --> 00:07:05,012
It's Jotaro's nerves of steel
and ability to make quick decisions.

98
00:07:05,879 --> 00:07:06,706
Yes.

99
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:09,339
Now I know it for sure.

100
00:07:20,786 --> 00:07:21,739
Is he dead?

101
00:07:23,789 --> 00:07:26,347
Hold on a second, Jotaro. He's just knocked out!

102
00:07:27,272 --> 00:07:29,471
Whatever you do, don't touch that sword.

103
00:07:29,876 --> 00:07:31,121
You snapped it in half,

104
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:33,554
but the stand's powers might still be lingering.

105
00:07:33,927 --> 00:07:36,773
It controls anyone who touches it while unsheathed.

106
00:07:37,226 --> 00:07:40,092
Let's get the blade back inside without touching the hilt.

107
00:07:50,327 --> 00:07:51,326
Now what?

108
00:07:51,351 --> 00:07:53,535
If someone draws it again, we're done for.

109
00:07:53,732 --> 00:07:56,565
This damn thing has already learned all of our abilities.

110
00:07:56,662 --> 00:07:59,271
I don't think we're gonna get any second chances.

111
00:08:00,666 --> 00:08:03,723
Why not toss it into the river
to rust at the bottom of the Nile?

112
00:08:04,289 --> 00:08:05,478
The Nile, huh?

113
00:08:05,538 --> 00:08:07,448
That sounds like a great plan to me.

114
00:08:07,473 --> 00:08:09,184
Hold it! This is the police!

115
00:08:09,209 --> 00:08:10,566
This is perfect timing!

116
00:08:10,596 --> 00:08:14,656
This guy needs a hospital! I have
multiple reports of a brawl at a barber shop!

117
00:08:14,868 --> 00:08:16,288
What are you doing with that sword?!

118
00:08:16,313 --> 00:08:16,781
Huh?

119
00:08:17,868 --> 00:08:19,445
Hand this weapon over immediately!

120
00:08:19,479 --> 00:08:21,098
Hey, stop it, would you?!

121
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:22,862
Don't pull it out!

122
00:08:33,546 --> 00:08:34,603
Polnareff!

123
00:08:36,581 --> 00:08:37,715
No, damn it.

124
00:08:39,324 --> 00:08:41,910
His eyes, that stare...

125
00:08:43,362 --> 00:08:45,966
Polnareff is being controlled by the sword's spell.

126
00:08:47,119 --> 00:08:50,105
Hey, you there! You drew the sword!

127
00:08:52,351 --> 00:08:54,213
I drew the sword, did I?

128
00:08:54,286 --> 00:08:59,043
Hmph. Officer, you should really be
more careful with your accusations,

129
00:08:59,143 --> 00:09:01,560
since you call yourself a servant of the law.

130
00:09:01,979 --> 00:09:04,059
Take it easy! What are you doing?

131
00:09:04,303 --> 00:09:07,576
I'm simply attacking the culprit who unsheathed the sword!

132
00:09:10,609 --> 00:09:13,147
I don't know who you are or where you're hiding,

133
00:09:13,578 --> 00:09:16,764
but I think it's safe to say
Polnareff is under your control.

134
00:09:17,406 --> 00:09:18,479
Come to think of it,

135
00:09:18,757 --> 00:09:21,365
I've never had to fight against Polnareff before.

136
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:21,902
Hmm?

137
00:09:22,673 --> 00:09:25,499
And I can't pull punches with chariot as an opponent.

138
00:09:27,025 --> 00:09:28,681
If I'm not smart about this,

139
00:09:29,121 --> 00:09:30,988
I could end up killing Polnareff.

140
00:09:33,853 --> 00:09:40,082
As I said before, at this point, I've already
witnessed Star Platinum's entire repertoire of moves,

141
00:09:40,387 --> 00:09:42,947
and if I've done battle with you once before,

142
00:09:43,101 --> 00:09:47,064
then I will never lose again!

143
00:09:51,404 --> 00:09:52,631
Ora!

144
00:09:54,998 --> 00:09:56,095
Hey, now.

145
00:10:03,812 --> 00:10:04,586
En garde!

146
00:10:04,618 --> 00:10:05,546
His speed,

147
00:10:06,397 --> 00:10:07,499
it's incredible!

148
00:10:08,347 --> 00:10:10,476
He's getting fast enough to outpace me!

149
00:10:11,289 --> 00:10:13,475
I have to find a way to stop that sword.

150
00:10:15,527 --> 00:10:16,728
I'll catch it again.

151
00:10:19,821 --> 00:10:20,708
It sped up!

152
00:10:20,733 --> 00:10:21,601
This time...

153
00:10:21,859 --> 00:10:23,332
I'll take your head!

154
00:10:23,958 --> 00:10:24,385
Wha...

155
00:10:25,451 --> 00:10:26,458
Ora!

156
00:10:34,913 --> 00:10:37,028
His speed and power are overwhelming.

157
00:10:37,993 --> 00:10:39,067
Without a doubt,

158
00:10:39,225 --> 00:10:41,500
this is the fastest stand I've ever faced.

159
00:10:42,421 --> 00:10:44,655
At the rate I'm going, this won't end well.

160
00:10:46,014 --> 00:10:48,549
I have to fight Polnareff with everything I've got,

161
00:10:49,234 --> 00:10:50,208
or I'm dead.

162
00:10:54,386 --> 00:10:58,582
So you head-butted the sword after
you realized you couldn't catch my blade.

163
00:10:58,763 --> 00:11:02,198
Honestly I didn't think you were
capable of something like that.

164
00:11:02,554 --> 00:11:04,233
I almost had you.

165
00:11:04,602 --> 00:11:05,642
But now...

166
00:11:07,439 --> 00:11:09,743
I've acquired that skill as well.

167
00:11:12,217 --> 00:11:13,173
Jotaro...

168
00:11:14,378 --> 00:11:19,478
I can tell that you're thinking the only way
to survive is to kill your friend, Polnareff.

169
00:11:21,386 --> 00:11:24,920
Even if you wanted to, it's
naive to think it'd be that easy.

170
00:11:25,419 --> 00:11:27,484
Take a close look, Jotaro.

171
00:11:27,757 --> 00:11:31,443
What I'm about to show you will
put an end to this once and for all.

172
00:11:32,758 --> 00:11:34,167
So, let's see...

173
00:11:36,226 --> 00:11:39,334
If you can beat this, Jotaro!

174
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:43,042
Feast your eyes on the silver chariot and Anubis

175
00:11:43,329 --> 00:11:45,023
two-sword technique!

176
00:12:28,094 --> 00:12:28,954
Damn it.

177
00:12:29,446 --> 00:12:30,673
This extra sword,

178
00:12:31,017 --> 00:12:32,893
coupled with his accelerating speed,

179
00:12:33,507 --> 00:12:35,495
even Star Platinum won't last long.

180
00:12:36,886 --> 00:12:40,444
What's the matter? Are you
feeling a little tired, Jotaro?!

181
00:12:42,794 --> 00:12:44,487
I'll stop him before he kills me.

182
00:12:44,566 --> 00:12:45,940
Star finger!

183
00:12:46,591 --> 00:12:47,037
Huh?

184
00:12:52,458 --> 00:12:54,918
My right arm is as light as a feather now.

185
00:12:55,961 --> 00:12:58,799
Interesting. I guess that was an option.

186
00:12:59,746 --> 00:13:01,456
Didn't see that coming, did you?!

187
00:13:01,641 --> 00:13:03,897
Round two! Armor release!

188
00:13:09,802 --> 00:13:14,083
You fool! Your ridiculous, "or a,
or a," is no match for two swords

189
00:13:14,183 --> 00:13:16,363
wielded by two master swordsmen!

190
00:13:24,714 --> 00:13:26,621
Your stomach is wide open!

191
00:13:28,247 --> 00:13:30,300
I've got you now!

192
00:13:33,314 --> 00:13:34,255
I did it!

193
00:13:34,287 --> 00:13:35,223
I win!

194
00:13:35,521 --> 00:13:38,591
Master Dio, I've exterminated Jotaro!

195
00:13:38,744 --> 00:13:41,663
I, Anubis, have finally put him down!

196
00:13:42,169 --> 00:13:44,102
Victory is mine!

197
00:13:51,989 --> 00:13:53,175
Just forget it.

198
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,576
You're not going to be able to pull out that blade.

199
00:13:55,735 --> 00:13:59,374
Give up already! I'm not sure
your tiny brain has realized it,

200
00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:01,364
but I've surpassed Star Platinum.

201
00:14:01,389 --> 00:14:03,512
And now the final thrust.

202
00:14:05,645 --> 00:14:07,794
The final thrust?

203
00:14:07,827 --> 00:14:09,597
Yes, precisely!

204
00:14:09,788 --> 00:14:13,162
Once I slice open your bowels, master Dio will rejoice!

205
00:14:13,249 --> 00:14:14,742
Please, stop this.

206
00:14:14,767 --> 00:14:16,662
Don't drive the blade any further.

207
00:14:17,096 --> 00:14:19,041
It... it'll be murder.

208
00:14:19,264 --> 00:14:22,851
Nice try, but you won't get any mercy from me!

209
00:14:22,876 --> 00:14:25,137
I can't wait to spill your guts!

210
00:14:36,641 --> 00:14:37,175
Ora!

211
00:14:39,099 --> 00:14:40,417
What the devil?!

212
00:14:40,539 --> 00:14:43,518
You're breaking me! I have to pull free!

213
00:14:44,535 --> 00:14:46,004
No! Stop!

214
00:14:49,476 --> 00:14:50,570
Maybe I'm wrong,

215
00:14:50,729 --> 00:14:53,358
but weren't you saying something about slicing me open?

216
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,126
I told you it'd be murder,

217
00:15:04,657 --> 00:15:07,854
but the murder I was talking about was yours, friend.

218
00:15:08,392 --> 00:15:11,531
You're a pretty easy target
when the sword isn't moving around.

219
00:15:15,867 --> 00:15:18,388
Damn it, what a pain in the ass.

220
00:15:18,859 --> 00:15:21,152
This was the toughest opponent I've faced.

221
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:24,067
That last attack took everything
I had in me and then some.

222
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:29,057
Luckily it was just enough to defeat him before he
could learn it like he did the rest of our attacks.

223
00:15:30,036 --> 00:15:31,163
This is new.

224
00:15:31,349 --> 00:15:33,244
I've never been so exhausted.

225
00:15:36,090 --> 00:15:39,196
I have to find Avdol and the old man.

226
00:15:43,996 --> 00:15:45,981
W-What in the world just happened?

227
00:15:49,970 --> 00:15:53,196
The sword didn't possess me like
it did all the other guys, did it?

228
00:15:53,925 --> 00:15:55,189
Yeah, it did,

229
00:15:55,407 --> 00:15:56,711
but it's over now.

230
00:15:56,924 --> 00:15:57,888
Forgive me.

231
00:15:58,757 --> 00:16:01,794
Just get the old man and Avdol.

232
00:16:02,141 --> 00:16:03,545
I'm too tired to walk.

233
00:16:04,946 --> 00:16:05,534
Huh?

234
00:16:08,126 --> 00:16:09,991
Wow, it's so shiny.

235
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:26,702
Now I've learned that trick.

236
00:16:27,018 --> 00:16:32,147
My original stand user was the sword
Smith who forged me 500 years ago.

237
00:16:32,731 --> 00:16:35,108
He may have perished centuries ago,

238
00:16:35,133 --> 00:16:38,072
but I survive as a stand with no master.

239
00:16:38,164 --> 00:16:42,648
Master Dio liberated me from the
gloomy shadows of a dusty museum.

240
00:16:44,618 --> 00:16:47,728
And speaking of master Dio, his stand,

241
00:16:47,753 --> 00:16:51,179
the world, is far more powerful than I.

242
00:16:51,551 --> 00:16:54,529
That's why I pledged my undying loyalty.

243
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:59,677
Jotaro, I swear on my life...

244
00:17:00,123 --> 00:17:03,144
I will murder you!

245
00:17:03,817 --> 00:17:06,332
I know your strength, your speed.

246
00:17:06,526 --> 00:17:09,549
You won't see it coming until it's too late to stop it!

247
00:17:09,668 --> 00:17:11,651
I'll stab you in the back!

248
00:17:13,788 --> 00:17:18,316
Now die, Jotaro!

249
00:17:20,203 --> 00:17:21,496
What just happened?!

250
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:24,238
Son of a... I missed!

251
00:17:24,383 --> 00:17:26,182
I was tripped by a dog?!

252
00:17:26,424 --> 00:17:28,653
Where the hell did that mutt come from?!

253
00:17:29,168 --> 00:17:31,430
Hey, Iggy, what are you eating?

254
00:17:31,464 --> 00:17:34,611
Wait a second. Is that a nasty, old sucker?

255
00:17:35,155 --> 00:17:38,439
Eating right off the ground again, you filthy mutt.

256
00:17:42,281 --> 00:17:45,088
You've gotta be kidding! It's the Nile river!

257
00:17:45,492 --> 00:17:48,185
Aah! No, this can't be happening!

258
00:17:48,487 --> 00:17:50,993
What did I do to deserve this cruel fate?!

259
00:17:51,076 --> 00:17:54,841
If I fall into the river, I'm done for! I'll rust away!

260
00:17:55,207 --> 00:17:57,273
Somebody stop me!

261
00:17:58,453 --> 00:18:00,195
Aah! Oh?!

262
00:18:00,445 --> 00:18:02,543
Aha! I'm heading for a wall!

263
00:18:02,608 --> 00:18:04,027
The wall will stop me!

264
00:18:04,403 --> 00:18:06,222
Lucky me!

265
00:18:06,712 --> 00:18:08,456
What the... shit!

266
00:18:08,908 --> 00:18:13,724
I was so panicked about falling into the water
that I accidentally phased right through the wall!

267
00:18:13,865 --> 00:18:15,292
I'm gonna fall in!

268
00:18:18,887 --> 00:18:20,000
Yes, it's a ship!

269
00:18:20,025 --> 00:18:21,073
I'm saved!

270
00:18:21,748 --> 00:18:25,883
If I wedge into those planks, that
guy's curiosity will make him pull me out,

271
00:18:26,297 --> 00:18:28,741
and then I'll take over his pathetic mind!

272
00:18:29,195 --> 00:18:31,232
Once I'm safely back on dry land,

273
00:18:31,324 --> 00:18:34,113
I'll use his body to take revenge on Jotaro!

274
00:18:37,896 --> 00:18:40,733
What?! A cow is on board?!

275
00:18:41,209 --> 00:18:44,264
Stop thrashing around! Hey, calm down!

276
00:18:44,370 --> 00:18:46,299
Would you cool it, you stupid cow?!

277
00:18:48,249 --> 00:18:50,737
I know! I'll take over the cow's mind!

278
00:18:50,817 --> 00:18:51,831
Then it'll be a cinch...

279
00:18:53,759 --> 00:18:57,331
I'm not gonna make it in time!

280
00:18:57,648 --> 00:18:58,759
Hey, over there!

281
00:18:58,817 --> 00:19:01,114
That cow's really rockin' the boat, don't you think?

282
00:19:01,139 --> 00:19:03,574
Oh, good grief. Who gives a damn?

283
00:19:03,682 --> 00:19:06,330
Just go and get the old man and Avdol, will you?

284
00:19:14,067 --> 00:19:18,129
Help me!

285
00:19:25,298 --> 00:19:26,919
Hey! Yoo-hoo!

286
00:19:26,944 --> 00:19:28,866
Oh, fishies, look down here!

287
00:19:30,356 --> 00:19:32,787
Come on. Swim over to me!

288
00:19:33,262 --> 00:19:34,915
Hey, wait! Where are you going?

289
00:19:36,676 --> 00:19:39,405
Hey, Mr. Crab, it's a pleasure to meet you.

290
00:19:39,471 --> 00:19:42,138
Would you mind doing me a favor and taking me ashore?

291
00:19:42,442 --> 00:19:44,151
I'll give you something yummy.

292
00:19:44,939 --> 00:19:47,796
Wait, Mr. Crab! You just can't leave me here!

293
00:19:47,821 --> 00:19:49,824
I'll be rusted through in a couple of days.

294
00:19:50,429 --> 00:19:51,751
Please, help me.

295
00:19:53,078 --> 00:19:56,167
Don't leave me here!

296
00:19:58,311 --> 00:20:00,595
I'm so alone!

297
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:16,618
Stupid mutt.

298
00:20:17,044 --> 00:20:18,354
What are you staring at?

299
00:20:18,379 --> 00:20:20,515
There's nothing to eat over there, flea bag.

300
00:20:25,445 --> 00:20:27,251
Why, you stinkin' little...

301
00:20:28,313 --> 00:20:29,146
Merde!

302
00:20:29,389 --> 00:20:31,568
What the hell have you been eating?!

303
00:20:31,978 --> 00:20:33,603
Come on, Polnareff.

304
00:20:33,847 --> 00:20:36,010
To think all of that happened without us.

305
00:20:36,035 --> 00:20:37,997
You fought the Anubis stand, huh?

306
00:20:38,176 --> 00:20:39,992
That must have been rough, Jotaro.

307
00:20:40,606 --> 00:20:41,829
Yeah, was.

308
00:20:43,863 --> 00:20:46,552
That's the last time I ever go anywhere with him.

309
00:20:49,028 --> 00:20:51,393
Stop it already, you stupid mutt!

310
00:20:51,616 --> 00:20:55,456
Get the hell off my face!

311
00:21:08,852 --> 00:21:13,719
The average tourist to Egypt is mostly
unaware of the country's rich ethnic diversity.

312
00:21:15,452 --> 00:21:19,482
For example, take this Egyptian
man wearing the traditional jellabiya

313
00:21:20,911 --> 00:21:22,777
or this Egyptian Nubian,

314
00:21:23,333 --> 00:21:26,251
and here is a Bedouin from Egypt's desert region.

315
00:21:27,504 --> 00:21:29,535
This gentleman hails from India.

316
00:21:31,374 --> 00:21:34,962
And as a random example, here's another Egyptian citizen.

317
00:21:37,536 --> 00:21:41,835
Hey! That fox has got some smokin'-hot
legs that are out of this world.

318
00:21:43,337 --> 00:21:45,223
I can't keep my eyes off her.

319
00:21:45,852 --> 00:21:49,527
Wow! Those puppies'll pull you right in, you know.
