1
00:00:00,187 --> 00:00:02,866
Previously on "jojo's bizarre adventure"...

2
00:00:04,238 --> 00:00:06,783
That's her! That woman there is the stand user!

3
00:00:08,542 --> 00:00:10,267
Ooh!

4
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:15,966
I do appreciate your forwardness, but you need
to work on your approach, you naughty, naughty man.

5
00:00:16,049 --> 00:00:16,825
Mwah!

6
00:00:17,205 --> 00:00:20,107
Oh, my god!

7
00:00:20,132 --> 00:00:25,427
I forgot to tell you. Whatever you do, it's imperative
that you refrain from touching any electrical outlets!

8
00:00:25,869 --> 00:00:26,217
Eh?

9
00:00:27,053 --> 00:00:29,371
I'm afraid I already did, Mr. Joestar.

10
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:30,264
What?!

11
00:00:31,779 --> 00:00:34,327
If what I know about magnets is true,

12
00:00:34,713 --> 00:00:36,852
we're being forced together!

13
00:00:39,733 --> 00:00:43,269
Mr. Joestar, I really hate saying this, but...

14
00:00:43,452 --> 00:00:44,326
Yeah, I know.

15
00:00:44,351 --> 00:00:46,904
We've gotten ourselves into a world of trouble.

16
00:02:28,337 --> 00:02:30,099
Hey! Wait a sec!

17
00:02:30,199 --> 00:02:31,206
Damn it all.

18
00:02:35,449 --> 00:02:37,593
Look! She's getting away! After her!

19
00:02:44,606 --> 00:02:46,756
Blast it! Now my body's a magnet!

20
00:02:46,816 --> 00:02:49,700
I can't believe we allowed
ourselves to play right into her hands!

21
00:02:49,732 --> 00:02:50,946
Calm down, Avdol.

22
00:02:51,014 --> 00:02:53,203
You getting hysterical isn't helping anything.

23
00:02:53,330 --> 00:02:56,463
Focus on figuring out how to overpower this blasted stand.

24
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:58,973
Damn it! Now where did that woman run off to?!

25
00:02:59,422 --> 00:03:00,757
I don't see her anywhere!

26
00:03:01,363 --> 00:03:03,549
Well, we can't keep rolling in the dirt forever!

27
00:03:03,633 --> 00:03:05,602
Why don't we try slowly standing up?

28
00:03:05,627 --> 00:03:06,517
Give it a go.

29
00:03:07,995 --> 00:03:08,748
Huh?

30
00:03:12,834 --> 00:03:14,057
All right, we did it.

31
00:03:14,221 --> 00:03:17,509
Now that we're upright, the next step
is to try pulling away from each other.

32
00:03:17,634 --> 00:03:20,025
However, I think it's going to be easier said than done,

33
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:23,730
since the magnetic force that's currently
holding us together has been doubled.

34
00:03:23,872 --> 00:03:27,290
But for now, let's use that fence to
try getting out of this predicament.

35
00:03:27,835 --> 00:03:31,906
We can do it, Avdol! Get those stomach
muscles ready, and make sure you stay in sync!

36
00:03:31,992 --> 00:03:33,844
Ready when you are, Mr. Joestar!

37
00:03:34,365 --> 00:03:36,567
One, two! One, two!

38
00:03:36,731 --> 00:03:40,205
One, two! One, two! One, two!

39
00:03:40,265 --> 00:03:41,651
One, two!

40
00:03:41,676 --> 00:03:42,249
Eh?

41
00:03:42,975 --> 00:03:47,219
Mr. Joestar, this is one of the most
embarrassing things I've ever done.

42
00:03:47,814 --> 00:03:49,462
What do you think you're looking at?!

43
00:03:49,598 --> 00:03:52,375
Can't you see that we're just practicing our dance moves?

44
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,243
It's true!

45
00:03:53,316 --> 00:03:56,676
What a perfect day for dancing outdoors!

46
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:59,284
Now run along! Get out of here, damn it!

47
00:04:02,738 --> 00:04:03,660
There we go!

48
00:04:03,765 --> 00:04:05,333
Almost got it, Avdol!

49
00:04:06,253 --> 00:04:08,797
And one, and two.

50
00:04:10,381 --> 00:04:11,174
We did it!

51
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,955
We made it, and we're still standing!

52
00:04:13,015 --> 00:04:14,762
Yes, a remarkable feat.

53
00:04:15,202 --> 00:04:17,274
Avdol, now that we've gotten over here,

54
00:04:17,321 --> 00:04:18,881
do you think you can slide off me?

55
00:04:20,543 --> 00:04:23,186
I think I might be able to.

56
00:04:23,439 --> 00:04:24,208
All right.

57
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:26,642
Here's what we're gonna do, so listen carefully.

58
00:04:26,668 --> 00:04:29,819
I'll hang on to the fence as
tightly as I can while you slide down.

59
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:32,374
Free yourself once you've gotten to the tip of my foot.

60
00:04:32,595 --> 00:04:36,295
Do you see how our faces are stuck
together as opposed to the other way around?

61
00:04:36,469 --> 00:04:40,003
Well, it's more than likely a sign that my
feet and your head should repel each other.

62
00:04:40,128 --> 00:04:42,613
Yes, that makes a lot of sense.

63
00:04:46,003 --> 00:04:48,290
That's the way, Avdol! Just keep moving!

64
00:04:54,645 --> 00:04:55,258
Hmm.

65
00:04:56,418 --> 00:04:59,526
Uh, hey, what's the matter with you, Avdol?

66
00:04:59,657 --> 00:05:02,492
D-don't you think this position is a little...

67
00:05:03,938 --> 00:05:06,199
This pose is highly suggestive, Mr. Joestar.

68
00:05:06,252 --> 00:05:08,898
If anyone were to see us, they
would be inclined to think that...

69
00:05:08,923 --> 00:05:10,909
Oh, come off it! No one's looking at us!

70
00:05:10,934 --> 00:05:12,353
Hurry up, and slide off my...

71
00:05:13,246 --> 00:05:14,379
Yaah!

72
00:05:14,544 --> 00:05:17,432
Those little brats came back and brought their friends!

73
00:05:17,811 --> 00:05:22,184
Why don't you take a hike?! There's nothing to see,
so knock it off with the staring, would you?!

74
00:05:22,224 --> 00:05:24,072
I said beat it, you little ankle biters!

75
00:05:24,146 --> 00:05:25,452
Get out of here! Take off!

76
00:05:25,508 --> 00:05:28,037
Avdol, hurry up, and get off
me before this gets any worse.

77
00:05:28,104 --> 00:05:30,097
I'm trying as hard as I can!

78
00:05:31,609 --> 00:05:33,736
I can't believe this is happening to me!

79
00:05:33,857 --> 00:05:35,325
The embarrassment!

80
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:37,237
All right, I'll be the one to move!

81
00:05:37,317 --> 00:05:40,043
Mr. Joestar, please slow down!

82
00:05:55,278 --> 00:05:59,128
Mr. Joestar, moving around like
that makes it seem as though we're...

83
00:06:01,825 --> 00:06:04,065
Oh, no! It's that old hag again!

84
00:06:05,044 --> 00:06:10,638
I come back expecting to find my handsome
man, and instead my eyes are assaulted with this?!

85
00:06:10,692 --> 00:06:15,379
How dare you toy with the fragile gift
of a maiden's heart, you filthy cheater?!

86
00:06:15,507 --> 00:06:17,702
For the love of god, hurry, Avdol!

87
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:20,907
She getting closer, and I can
already feel the tears coming!

88
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:23,164
Dirty, rotten scoundrel!

89
00:06:24,925 --> 00:06:27,642
Help me! Oh, my god!

90
00:06:27,682 --> 00:06:30,251
Please calm down! You've got it all wrong!

91
00:06:35,418 --> 00:06:36,548
We did it!

92
00:06:37,443 --> 00:06:40,192
We need to stay far apart from each other!

93
00:06:40,245 --> 00:06:43,273
Your magnetic pull is getting more powerful by the second!

94
00:06:43,399 --> 00:06:45,452
It serves you right, you damned fool!

95
00:06:45,477 --> 00:06:47,927
You and your boy toy, go to hell!

96
00:06:53,297 --> 00:06:53,990
What the...

97
00:06:55,096 --> 00:06:56,233
There she is!

98
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:57,484
We found her.

99
00:06:57,571 --> 00:07:00,206
Just look at her having her morning cigarette.

100
00:07:00,862 --> 00:07:03,142
Avdol, try going after her from that side.

101
00:07:03,245 --> 00:07:05,463
We can't let her get away from us this time.

102
00:07:05,944 --> 00:07:08,223
She's cunning, so this may be a trap.

103
00:07:13,302 --> 00:07:14,248
This can't be!

104
00:07:14,317 --> 00:07:18,672
Mr. Joestar, it would appear as though
we've already fallen right into her trap!

105
00:07:18,752 --> 00:07:19,365
Eh?

106
00:07:20,076 --> 00:07:20,684
Hmm.

107
00:07:22,022 --> 00:07:24,436
Ahh! They're railroad tracks!

108
00:07:24,576 --> 00:07:27,558
And I don't think we're going
to be able to get off that easily!

109
00:07:35,345 --> 00:07:36,641
Are you kidding me?!

110
00:07:36,673 --> 00:07:37,908
It would seem...

111
00:07:38,419 --> 00:07:41,011
That we're stuck together again!

112
00:07:45,461 --> 00:07:47,353
Son of a bi... eh?

113
00:07:56,893 --> 00:07:59,160
Mr. Joestar, something is coming.

114
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:01,422
That sound...

115
00:08:01,841 --> 00:08:04,831
Oh, no, we have to get the hell
out of here as fast as we can!

116
00:08:04,868 --> 00:08:08,121
Avdol, I need you to use magician's
red to burn through the tracks!

117
00:08:08,145 --> 00:08:09,410
We need to get out of here!

118
00:08:09,441 --> 00:08:11,660
But, Mr. Joestar, I don't think that would be...

119
00:08:12,178 --> 00:08:13,057
Eh?

120
00:08:17,814 --> 00:08:19,683
It's here! There's the train!

121
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:21,042
Hurry up, and melt those tracks!

122
00:08:21,067 --> 00:08:22,959
I tried telling you, Mr. Joestar!

123
00:08:23,239 --> 00:08:25,167
If I were to burn away these tracks...

124
00:08:26,415 --> 00:08:27,832
The train would derail,

125
00:08:27,917 --> 00:08:30,895
and innocent people would go tumbling to their deaths!

126
00:08:35,007 --> 00:08:35,701
Shit!

127
00:08:36,056 --> 00:08:38,802
That damn woman is pure, unadulterated evil!

128
00:08:46,725 --> 00:08:49,154
I'm almost positive my vines would be able to hold her,

129
00:08:49,186 --> 00:08:52,721
but at that distance, she's too far
out of range for them to even reach her,

130
00:08:52,746 --> 00:08:57,185
so our best bet is me trying to pull us free
from the tracks using that post as an anchor.

131
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,521
I-it's no use!

132
00:09:09,571 --> 00:09:12,407
The magnetic pull is even stronger than it was before!

133
00:09:12,461 --> 00:09:16,195
Mr. Joestar, it's life or death!
You can't stop pulling, no matter what!

134
00:09:16,488 --> 00:09:19,192
It's coming! You have to pull harder!

135
00:09:34,798 --> 00:09:36,291
That didn't work!

136
00:09:36,366 --> 00:09:37,784
I win.

137
00:10:05,645 --> 00:10:07,860
I took care of them for you, lord Dio.

138
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,062
Now that that's done,

139
00:10:09,095 --> 00:10:12,003
I'm going to do away with Jotaro and Polnareff.

140
00:10:15,061 --> 00:10:15,593
Eh?

141
00:10:17,068 --> 00:10:18,371
Good thinking, Avdol!

142
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:22,801
Only someone as clever as you would burn the
railroad tracks and dig a trench underneath!

143
00:10:22,875 --> 00:10:25,544
You see, Mr. Joestar, unlike that earlier incident,

144
00:10:25,612 --> 00:10:28,933
Mohammed Avdol does indeed have a decent modicum of class.

145
00:10:29,008 --> 00:10:31,495
Doing things this way is a little more my style.

146
00:10:33,238 --> 00:10:35,885
So you think you've outsmarted me?

147
00:10:36,622 --> 00:10:37,595
You...

148
00:10:37,984 --> 00:10:41,385
Obnoxious pieces of shit!

149
00:10:41,487 --> 00:10:43,548
Magician's red!

150
00:10:47,119 --> 00:10:48,892
Me, too! Hermit purple!

151
00:10:58,309 --> 00:10:59,602
Now we've got you.

152
00:10:59,786 --> 00:11:02,057
Unfortunately for you, young lady,

153
00:11:02,156 --> 00:11:04,753
I've got to keep a grip on your neck until you pass out,

154
00:11:04,778 --> 00:11:08,065
so you can count on being in the
hospital for at least a week or so.

155
00:11:08,350 --> 00:11:12,085
I can't just let you and your
magnetic power run free, can I?

156
00:11:20,393 --> 00:11:21,077
Hmm?

157
00:11:24,006 --> 00:11:26,347
Are your imaginations running wild?

158
00:11:26,394 --> 00:11:30,558
Sorry to disappoint, boys, but
my breasts aren't getting larger.

159
00:11:33,746 --> 00:11:38,422
But there's no need to worry yourselves,
because your magnetism's growing even stronger.

160
00:11:38,482 --> 00:11:42,685
And lucky for me I just happened
to stuff my bra with weapons.

161
00:11:43,047 --> 00:11:45,628
Mr. Joestar, we have incoming!

162
00:11:50,496 --> 00:11:51,689
Magician's red!

163
00:12:01,641 --> 00:12:04,112
Your magnetism will keep intensifying,

164
00:12:04,338 --> 00:12:08,108
well, at least until your
bodies are crushed to tiny pieces.

165
00:12:08,435 --> 00:12:09,901
She's getting away again!

166
00:12:09,942 --> 00:12:12,822
No, I don't think so. It's all part of her strategy.

167
00:12:12,847 --> 00:12:16,396
She's moving farther away from us
in order to maintain a safe distance.

168
00:12:16,683 --> 00:12:19,013
Remember, that woman's a stand user,

169
00:12:19,119 --> 00:12:21,272
so she needs to stay close to her target.

170
00:12:21,506 --> 00:12:24,067
If she gets too close to us, we'll be able to catch her,

171
00:12:24,144 --> 00:12:26,740
but if she's too far out of range, her power won't work.

172
00:12:26,855 --> 00:12:29,108
This magnetism is still just a stand.

173
00:12:29,215 --> 00:12:30,318
The normal rules apply,

174
00:12:30,343 --> 00:12:34,040
which means if she puts too much distance
between us, the magnetism should weaken.

175
00:12:34,074 --> 00:12:36,777
So what should we do? If we don't get free,

176
00:12:36,951 --> 00:12:39,718
the magnetic force will just continue to intensify.

177
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:41,982
Should we keep running until we're out of range?

178
00:12:42,015 --> 00:12:43,575
That might be our best bet.

179
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:49,122
No way. We might be able to get away from her powers for
a short amount of time, but the stand would still prevail.

180
00:12:49,404 --> 00:12:51,085
I've run away from fights before,

181
00:12:51,124 --> 00:12:54,372
but I've only done so when running
was part of the overall strategy.

182
00:12:54,687 --> 00:12:56,155
No matter how hopeless things look,

183
00:12:56,195 --> 00:12:58,509
Joseph Joestar never throws in the towel.

184
00:12:58,705 --> 00:13:01,795
The real showdown begins now!

185
00:13:02,207 --> 00:13:02,798
Hmm?

186
00:13:05,698 --> 00:13:07,213
I've drawn a map of the town.

187
00:13:07,593 --> 00:13:11,243
Here's our current position,
and here's where the woman's going.

188
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,418
As long as she continues moving down this road,

189
00:13:14,505 --> 00:13:16,957
she'll eventually loop around and head back this way.

190
00:13:17,095 --> 00:13:18,298
We'll split up, and...

191
00:13:18,944 --> 00:13:21,298
Right here is where we'll catch that witch.

192
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,263
It doesn't matter if she's a woman or not.

193
00:13:24,294 --> 00:13:27,829
When we catch her, she's getting a taste of my boot!

194
00:13:28,502 --> 00:13:29,608
Let's get going!

195
00:13:29,648 --> 00:13:30,615
Check it out.

196
00:13:30,866 --> 00:13:33,066
Oh, yeah. Someone's cut the rails.

197
00:13:33,625 --> 00:13:35,272
Good. The locals are here.

198
00:13:35,493 --> 00:13:39,321
I'm sure one of them will have the foresight
to notify the authorities about the tracks

199
00:13:39,346 --> 00:13:40,901
before the next train arrives.

200
00:13:41,661 --> 00:13:42,345
Come on!

201
00:13:50,586 --> 00:13:51,273
Huh?

202
00:13:51,586 --> 00:13:53,336
Something is definitely up.

203
00:13:53,361 --> 00:13:55,689
Hey! Did you hear someone cut the rail line?!

204
00:13:55,814 --> 00:13:57,190
What about all the trains?

205
00:13:57,289 --> 00:13:59,902
Luckily they've stopped running, at least for now.

206
00:13:59,939 --> 00:14:01,935
Someone actually cut the rail line?

207
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:04,356
People nowadays sure are sick, don't you think?

208
00:14:04,731 --> 00:14:07,547
Who in their right mind would do something so terrible?

209
00:14:07,601 --> 00:14:09,062
Major douche canoe.

210
00:14:10,252 --> 00:14:12,515
Jotaro, you wanna know what I think?

211
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:14,713
Rotten people always get what's coming to 'em.

212
00:14:14,738 --> 00:14:17,301
You Mark my words. They'll get theirs.

213
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:36,118
I saved three months' salary, all for this.

214
00:14:36,311 --> 00:14:37,428
Will you marry me?

215
00:14:37,453 --> 00:14:38,515
Oh, my!

216
00:14:39,957 --> 00:14:41,005
Huh? What the?

217
00:14:41,198 --> 00:14:42,502
Wait! Where did the...

218
00:14:42,568 --> 00:14:43,615
The ring!

219
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:53,846
Those morons are getting closer to me,

220
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:56,496
but at this rate, they'll never catch me.

221
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:02,389
Huh?

222
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:23,855
Almost there. Almost there.

223
00:15:24,336 --> 00:15:24,934
Hmm?

224
00:15:50,353 --> 00:15:53,181
I must say you're looking a little weighted down.

225
00:15:53,259 --> 00:15:56,183
But don't worry. The wild-goose chase ends here.

226
00:15:58,595 --> 00:16:03,914
Interestingly enough, it would seem that the two
of us are more familiar with this town than you are.

227
00:16:04,136 --> 00:16:05,989
You should take a look behind you.

228
00:16:08,422 --> 00:16:09,945
You're now caught between us,

229
00:16:10,031 --> 00:16:11,840
and there's nowhere for you to run.

230
00:16:11,891 --> 00:16:13,869
It may have taken a while to get here,

231
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:15,650
but the tables have turned.

232
00:16:27,011 --> 00:16:27,983
Hmm?

233
00:16:30,517 --> 00:16:32,608
So you think I have nowhere to go?

234
00:16:32,819 --> 00:16:35,477
You boys truly haven't realized it yet, have you?

235
00:16:35,803 --> 00:16:40,526
You only thought you were hunting me, when
really I was luring you here the entire time!

236
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:42,448
Look up, idiots!

237
00:16:43,465 --> 00:16:44,126
Huh?

238
00:16:46,633 --> 00:16:48,389
High-voltage power lines!

239
00:16:48,434 --> 00:16:50,403
Oh, no! The power lines are...

240
00:16:51,650 --> 00:16:52,501
That's right.

241
00:16:52,636 --> 00:16:54,916
Power lines are extremely magnetic!

242
00:16:59,776 --> 00:17:02,631
I'm afraid you're going to fry this time, Joestar!

243
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:05,310
Magician's red!

244
00:17:08,768 --> 00:17:10,684
Hermit purple!

245
00:17:12,684 --> 00:17:17,196
Avdol might be able to defend himself
for now with his flames, but not you.

246
00:17:17,257 --> 00:17:18,977
Time to die, Joestar.

247
00:17:19,025 --> 00:17:21,785
My stand, the goddess bast is the perfect trap,

248
00:17:21,854 --> 00:17:24,844
and it's also far more powerful than your hermit purple!

249
00:17:26,392 --> 00:17:29,266
Hope you've said your prayers, because it's time to die!

250
00:17:38,726 --> 00:17:39,619
Vile woman.

251
00:17:39,697 --> 00:17:42,172
My flames will burn you and your evil alive!

252
00:17:48,034 --> 00:17:51,175
My entire body is being pulled in another direction!

253
00:17:51,243 --> 00:17:53,303
I... I can't resist!

254
00:18:03,736 --> 00:18:06,828
My flames should be strong enough
to melt the steel without a problem,

255
00:18:07,058 --> 00:18:09,502
but I can't defend myself from every attack,

256
00:18:09,667 --> 00:18:12,523
and this weight is crushing me!

257
00:18:18,601 --> 00:18:20,827
I can't hold it any longer!

258
00:18:21,370 --> 00:18:24,942
Joseph Joestar, since you're going to die anyway,

259
00:18:25,209 --> 00:18:28,388
I can confess that I find you to be quite a catch.

260
00:18:28,587 --> 00:18:31,456
It's true that I only knew you for a short time,

261
00:18:31,493 --> 00:18:34,195
but you were so clever and hilarious,

262
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:38,129
not to mention your experience
would make younger men green with envy,

263
00:18:38,511 --> 00:18:40,362
plus you're very handsome.

264
00:18:41,224 --> 00:18:43,741
I know that you and I are decades apart,

265
00:18:43,952 --> 00:18:45,785
but if I'm being honest with myself,

266
00:18:45,911 --> 00:18:47,926
you would have made a splendid lover.

267
00:18:49,494 --> 00:18:52,376
Well, if that's how you truly feel about me,

268
00:18:52,869 --> 00:18:55,002
then what do you say you give me a hand?

269
00:18:55,088 --> 00:18:56,053
Hmm.

270
00:18:56,623 --> 00:19:01,669
I've seen the light and realize that your stand is
way more powerful than mine could ever hope to be!

271
00:19:02,211 --> 00:19:03,846
I can't hold it anymore!

272
00:19:04,164 --> 00:19:05,801
Please! I'm begging you!

273
00:19:05,826 --> 00:19:07,761
You have to turn off the magnetism!

274
00:19:08,227 --> 00:19:09,918
Well, I suppose I could...

275
00:19:12,366 --> 00:19:14,074
But, no, I don't think I will.

276
00:19:14,474 --> 00:19:18,946
While you are exceptionally handsome,
you're nowhere near as good-looking as lord Dio.

277
00:19:19,022 --> 00:19:23,216
So you're saying that you refuse
to turn off the power no matter what?

278
00:19:23,249 --> 00:19:24,475
Exactly right.

279
00:19:24,536 --> 00:19:26,608
Now don't you have some dying to do?

280
00:19:26,708 --> 00:19:28,743
Even though I'm groveling to you?

281
00:19:28,823 --> 00:19:30,990
I won't say it again, you idiot.

282
00:19:32,089 --> 00:19:33,904
If that's how you're going to be,

283
00:19:33,944 --> 00:19:35,743
then it's your loss, young lady.

284
00:19:35,768 --> 00:19:36,469
What?!

285
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:41,166
Shit! Shit!

286
00:19:48,348 --> 00:19:52,187
Weren't you listening to us earlier?
You've been caught between us the whole time.

287
00:19:52,404 --> 00:19:54,721
Magnets are attracted to each other, you know.

288
00:19:54,836 --> 00:19:57,091
It's too late to do anything about it now,

289
00:19:57,116 --> 00:19:59,563
but getting between us was your biggest blunder.

290
00:19:59,686 --> 00:20:02,176
There's no way she can hear you, Mr. Joestar.

291
00:20:02,287 --> 00:20:04,358
She's already lost consciousness.

292
00:20:04,506 --> 00:20:06,868
All the metal and magnetic force has crushed her,

293
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:10,892
and it's very likely that she's broken
more than a few bones in the process.

294
00:20:19,291 --> 00:20:20,006
Hmm.

295
00:20:25,597 --> 00:20:26,651
Hmm.

296
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:30,414
Hmm.

297
00:20:31,134 --> 00:20:32,049
All right,

298
00:20:32,171 --> 00:20:34,597
why don't we get that breakfast we were talking about?

299
00:20:35,546 --> 00:20:37,609
Yes, a wonderful idea.

300
00:20:37,757 --> 00:20:40,307
All this running around has made me rather hungry.

301
00:20:40,446 --> 00:20:42,171
Is it really only 9 A.M.?

302
00:20:42,608 --> 00:20:44,810
Damn, you pieces of shit...

303
00:20:58,539 --> 00:21:00,925
Those two are taking forever!

304
00:21:01,031 --> 00:21:05,556
As long as they've been in there, you'd think
they were putting on makeup and dressing for a gala.

305
00:21:06,503 --> 00:21:08,529
And it's almost 9 A.M.

306
00:21:10,402 --> 00:21:11,212
Hmm.

307
00:21:12,549 --> 00:21:15,174
They may have run into an enemy on the way here.

308
00:21:15,874 --> 00:21:18,106
You think we should see where they ran off to?

309
00:21:18,131 --> 00:21:20,488
I guess. Ah, good grief.

310
00:21:20,992 --> 00:21:22,563
It's time to go, Iggy.

311
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:26,761
Yeah, yeah, I know you're hungry.

312
00:21:26,786 --> 00:21:29,575
You're not the only one, believe me.

313
00:21:34,596 --> 00:21:35,976
Hmm.

314
00:21:38,269 --> 00:21:41,828
Josef and Avdol are in the
middle of doing battle with Mariah,

315
00:21:41,995 --> 00:21:46,978
so I, Alessi, shall take on the great
honor of killing Jotaro and Polnareff.
