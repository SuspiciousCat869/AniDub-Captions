1
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:13,724
What are you doing, Kakyoin?

2
00:00:14,079 --> 00:00:15,359
I understand now.

3
00:00:17,632 --> 00:00:20,946
I know now how to uncover the secret of Dio's stand.

4
00:00:20,987 --> 00:00:21,578
What?

5
00:00:41,027 --> 00:00:46,647
For Noriaki Kakyoin, Hierophant Green served
as a poignant reminder of a time long past.

6
00:00:49,662 --> 00:00:50,688
It's Noriaki.

7
00:00:50,924 --> 00:00:53,350
He doesn't attempt to socialize with the other children.

8
00:00:53,814 --> 00:00:57,822
It's not that he's disliked, per se.
He just seems a bit too reserved.

9
00:00:58,364 --> 00:01:00,987
As his teacher, I'm very concerned.

10
00:01:01,616 --> 00:01:03,376
I'm ashamed to say it, but...

11
00:01:03,629 --> 00:01:05,935
I'm afraid I don't understand it either.

12
00:01:07,373 --> 00:01:09,558
I always had the same thoughts.

13
00:01:10,991 --> 00:01:14,232
Life is full of interactions
where we meet all sorts of people,

14
00:01:14,922 --> 00:01:17,652
but how often do those meetings involve deeper thinking?

15
00:01:18,098 --> 00:01:20,837
How often do we make genuine human connections?

16
00:01:22,686 --> 00:01:26,658
All of my classmates have address
books filled with their friends' names.

17
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:31,146
Each of them must have a book of 50, no, 100 names.

18
00:01:32,087 --> 00:01:34,677
Mom has dad, and dad has mom.

19
00:01:34,824 --> 00:01:35,964
But I have no one.

20
00:01:36,123 --> 00:01:40,266
I'm sure rock stars and TV celebrities
have tens of thousands of friends.

21
00:01:40,313 --> 00:01:41,748
But I have no one.

22
00:01:42,347 --> 00:01:43,900
I'll never have any friends.

23
00:01:44,637 --> 00:01:46,310
No one will ever understand me.

24
00:01:47,407 --> 00:01:50,078
I'm the only one who can see Hierophant Green.

25
00:01:50,717 --> 00:01:54,410
How am I supposed to truly relate to
someone if they can't see the real me?

26
00:01:55,236 --> 00:01:56,175
It's impossible.

27
00:01:57,502 --> 00:01:59,279
That's how I used to think about life

28
00:01:59,472 --> 00:02:04,035
until I met Mr. Joestar, Jotaro, Polnareff, and Avdol.

29
00:02:05,862 --> 00:02:07,863
Whenever I think about Avdol and Iggy,

30
00:02:07,888 --> 00:02:11,127
it makes the hairs on the back of my neck stand on end.

31
00:02:11,551 --> 00:02:14,884
I'm sure it's because they were
the first to treat me like a friend.

32
00:02:15,905 --> 00:02:18,460
My friends and I were on a journey to defeat Dio,

33
00:02:18,778 --> 00:02:20,488
and while it may have been short-lived,

34
00:02:20,581 --> 00:02:22,826
they've understood me better than anyone.

35
00:02:25,539 --> 00:02:28,791
Looking at Hierophant Green
was a revelation for Kakyoin.

36
00:02:29,272 --> 00:02:32,640
I'll make Hierophant Green invisible
to everyone, like it used to be.

37
00:02:32,991 --> 00:02:35,268
I'll use its invisibility to my advantage

38
00:02:35,349 --> 00:02:38,390
and reveal Dio's secret before finishing him off for good!

39
00:04:11,763 --> 00:04:13,079
Hey, Jotaro!

40
00:04:16,549 --> 00:04:18,504
The truck is completely totaled.

41
00:04:18,638 --> 00:04:19,317
Up there!

42
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:23,154
I can sense the old man and
Dio racing across the rooftops.

43
00:04:27,538 --> 00:04:30,379
I've only dealt with Kakyoin and Joseph so far.

44
00:04:30,913 --> 00:04:34,329
Interesting. They're attempting to strike from both sides,

45
00:04:34,902 --> 00:04:39,590
which means Jotaro and Polnareff must be
waiting in the wings to attack me from behind.

46
00:04:40,922 --> 00:04:42,589
How futile.

47
00:04:47,025 --> 00:04:47,871
This is...

48
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:51,364
It's Kakyoin's Hierophant Green!

49
00:05:00,629 --> 00:05:02,229
He turned it into a web?

50
00:05:09,902 --> 00:05:10,435
Hmm?

51
00:05:20,978 --> 00:05:22,313
So you've laid a...

52
00:05:22,641 --> 00:05:23,414
That's right.

53
00:05:24,969 --> 00:05:28,150
Anything that touches this web is instantly fired upon,

54
00:05:28,417 --> 00:05:30,952
and you're surrounded for 20 meters on all sides.

55
00:05:31,845 --> 00:05:36,346
You're done, Dio! I've snared you and
your stand, and I can sense your every move.

56
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:52,315
Now die!

57
00:05:52,455 --> 00:05:55,216
20-meter-radius emerald splash!

58
00:05:57,551 --> 00:05:59,910
You're a fool, Kakyoin.

59
00:06:00,579 --> 00:06:03,600
With my stand, I have the ability to rule the world!

60
00:06:03,648 --> 00:06:06,679
What can you do in the face of such overwhelming power?

61
00:06:07,043 --> 00:06:08,974
All right, here it comes.

62
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:12,240
Behold, The World!

63
00:06:16,798 --> 00:06:17,967
Huh? What?

64
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,372
Kakyoin!

65
00:06:19,574 --> 00:06:22,117
He went flying through the air like a rag doll.

66
00:06:22,803 --> 00:06:23,723
But how?!

67
00:06:26,292 --> 00:06:27,462
Kakyoin!

68
00:06:30,395 --> 00:06:31,923
I don't understand.

69
00:06:32,822 --> 00:06:33,946
What just happened?

70
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:38,758
Did he really hit me?

71
00:06:41,886 --> 00:06:44,161
I can't even move a single finger.

72
00:06:45,312 --> 00:06:46,705
I can't speak, either.

73
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:49,318
It must have been a fatal blow.

74
00:06:53,614 --> 00:06:54,998
It's 5:15,

75
00:06:55,678 --> 00:06:58,382
which means that it's midnight back in Japan.

76
00:06:59,906 --> 00:07:02,345
I wonder what mom and dad are doing right now.

77
00:07:02,708 --> 00:07:05,609
Knowing them, I'm sure they're sound asleep.

78
00:07:06,345 --> 00:07:08,406
I'm sorry for worrying you.

79
00:07:10,041 --> 00:07:12,444
Despite his brief moment of reflection,

80
00:07:12,605 --> 00:07:16,119
Noriaki Kakyoin's last thoughts were not of his parents.

81
00:07:16,685 --> 00:07:20,683
His mind shifted and homed in on the
question weighing heaviest on his mind.

82
00:07:20,914 --> 00:07:24,584
He had to find an answer before nothingness took hold.

83
00:07:25,849 --> 00:07:30,328
I should be able to instantly sense any
movement within Hierophant Green's web,

84
00:07:30,961 --> 00:07:36,451
but somehow Dio managed to destroy
the entire web in the blink of an eye,

85
00:07:37,017 --> 00:07:39,099
and it wasn't one strand at a time.

86
00:07:39,772 --> 00:07:41,331
It was instantaneous,

87
00:07:42,058 --> 00:07:44,115
not even a split-second difference.

88
00:07:45,074 --> 00:07:48,920
How did he shatter a 20-meter-radius area all at once?

89
00:07:49,983 --> 00:07:50,764
How?

90
00:07:52,412 --> 00:07:54,243
There wasn't even a slight delay.

91
00:07:57,169 --> 00:07:58,821
What's his secret?

92
00:08:00,947 --> 00:08:01,822
Damn it.

93
00:08:02,794 --> 00:08:03,866
Kakyoin!

94
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:06,173
Shit. I've had enough of this!

95
00:08:06,493 --> 00:08:08,154
Hermit purpl... eh?

96
00:08:08,621 --> 00:08:09,194
Eh?

97
00:08:09,389 --> 00:08:12,216
You're next on the chopping block, Joseph.

98
00:08:14,571 --> 00:08:17,862
In order for Jonathan's body to become mine completely,

99
00:08:18,166 --> 00:08:22,777
I must drink the blood of a Joestar, and I
think now's as good a time as any to partake.

100
00:08:22,844 --> 00:08:24,570
Dio!

101
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:29,208
How did he destroy them all
without the slightest delay in time?

102
00:08:30,581 --> 00:08:31,428
Time.

103
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:33,806
Time.

104
00:08:35,233 --> 00:08:36,139
Time.

105
00:08:38,067 --> 00:08:39,041
The time!

106
00:08:43,910 --> 00:08:44,650
That's it.

107
00:08:45,377 --> 00:08:48,161
Something as outlandish as that doesn't seem possible,

108
00:08:48,699 --> 00:08:50,453
but there's no other explanation.

109
00:08:51,446 --> 00:08:53,405
I have to find a way to tell the others.

110
00:08:54,379 --> 00:08:57,697
They need to know the truth
behind such a terrifying ability.

111
00:08:58,679 --> 00:09:01,416
If I can't tell Mr. Joestar what I've learned...

112
00:09:03,282 --> 00:09:05,793
The friends I've come to love are going to die.

113
00:09:08,801 --> 00:09:11,058
You're gonna pay for what you've done.

114
00:09:11,204 --> 00:09:12,311
Just you wait!

115
00:09:12,345 --> 00:09:15,460
I'm taking that body back in the name of granny Erina.

116
00:09:15,533 --> 00:09:19,652
Erina? Ah, you mean that backwater shrew?

117
00:09:19,984 --> 00:09:21,179
Nonsense.

118
00:09:21,807 --> 00:09:25,326
I'm going to drink your blood, then eliminate you vermin.

119
00:09:45,396 --> 00:09:48,643
Now, Joseph Joestar, die!

120
00:09:56,242 --> 00:09:56,765
Huh?

121
00:09:56,908 --> 00:09:57,396
Hmm?

122
00:10:08,299 --> 00:10:11,368
That was my final emerald splash.

123
00:10:12,346 --> 00:10:13,529
Make it count.

124
00:10:15,666 --> 00:10:18,615
But why? That attack was utterly pointless.

125
00:10:18,878 --> 00:10:24,520
Well, I suppose you're now just a dying
hero longing to make his Mark on the world. Heh.

126
00:10:24,627 --> 00:10:29,407
As if! Kakyoin wouldn't waste the time
he has left with some meaningless attack.

127
00:10:29,904 --> 00:10:31,561
Why'd he go after the clock?

128
00:10:32,495 --> 00:10:34,148
Was it some kind of sign?

129
00:10:34,741 --> 00:10:36,518
Was he trying to tell me something?

130
00:10:39,633 --> 00:10:41,041
It's a message.

131
00:10:42,123 --> 00:10:44,938
I don't have the strength to give you another.

132
00:10:46,733 --> 00:10:48,054
Mr. Joestar...

133
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:51,065
You have to decipher it.

134
00:10:53,245 --> 00:10:56,445
You have to let the others know.

135
00:10:58,933 --> 00:11:00,804
Kakyoin.

136
00:11:04,818 --> 00:11:07,869
Noriaki Kakyoin has died.

137
00:11:15,108 --> 00:11:16,688
Hermit purple!

138
00:11:16,895 --> 00:11:18,125
Now take this!

139
00:11:18,193 --> 00:11:20,132
Hamon of the sun!

140
00:11:20,225 --> 00:11:21,445
You old fool!

141
00:11:21,483 --> 00:11:24,493
Out of all the stands I've seen, yours is the weakest!

142
00:11:26,412 --> 00:11:27,514
No, you don't!

143
00:11:36,789 --> 00:11:39,977
Kakyoin, why did you destroy the clock earlier?

144
00:11:40,318 --> 00:11:43,611
Wait. You were trying to send me a message, weren't you?

145
00:11:43,772 --> 00:11:46,170
But how does it relate to the clock tower?

146
00:11:48,517 --> 00:11:50,105
That was Mr. Joestar!

147
00:11:50,178 --> 00:11:51,605
And Dio's closing in.

148
00:11:52,142 --> 00:11:53,742
Where the hell is Kakyoin?!

149
00:11:58,025 --> 00:11:59,691
Could that be it, Kakyoin?

150
00:11:59,939 --> 00:12:03,496
Did you figure out the secret of his
stand's ability in your dying moments?

151
00:12:05,887 --> 00:12:08,582
You destroyed the clock with emerald splash...

152
00:12:09,947 --> 00:12:12,079
But you aimed for the hands...

153
00:12:13,586 --> 00:12:15,533
Which stopped the clock.

154
00:12:16,061 --> 00:12:16,588
Huh?!

155
00:12:17,041 --> 00:12:19,234
No way! That's impossible!

156
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:24,513
Dio's stand, The World, has the power to...

157
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:28,129
stop time whenever Dio commands it to!

158
00:12:29,769 --> 00:12:31,144
Now die!

159
00:12:31,262 --> 00:12:33,997
20-meter-radius emerald splash!

160
00:12:35,662 --> 00:12:37,984
Behold, The World!

161
00:13:05,491 --> 00:13:08,139
Now witness the power of the world.

162
00:13:08,558 --> 00:13:11,671
That's right. I've caused time to stop for you,

163
00:13:11,736 --> 00:13:14,979
which means you won't see or feel any of this.

164
00:13:17,906 --> 00:13:20,218
Now die, Kakyoin!

165
00:13:24,636 --> 00:13:27,256
You don't even realize you're about to die.

166
00:13:27,497 --> 00:13:29,071
In a way, you're lucky.

167
00:13:29,991 --> 00:13:31,799
You won't know what happened here,

168
00:13:31,903 --> 00:13:33,587
only that you're dying.

169
00:13:39,418 --> 00:13:41,518
I understand now, Kakyoin.

170
00:13:41,721 --> 00:13:44,286
That's what you were trying to tell me in your message.

171
00:13:44,684 --> 00:13:47,142
I'm not gonna waste this chance!

172
00:14:00,883 --> 00:14:02,751
Freezing time is bad enough,

173
00:14:02,996 --> 00:14:06,300
but Dio being able to move
around, too, is a deadly combo.

174
00:14:06,388 --> 00:14:07,504
Unbelievable.

175
00:14:07,596 --> 00:14:09,788
We might not have what it takes to beat it!

176
00:14:12,441 --> 00:14:15,326
Just calm down. Calm down, and think.

177
00:14:15,673 --> 00:14:17,942
I don't know the meaning of the word "panic."

178
00:14:18,238 --> 00:14:20,124
There has to be a way to beat him,

179
00:14:21,111 --> 00:14:23,650
and if anyone can find it, it's me.

180
00:14:26,185 --> 00:14:27,065
He's gone.

181
00:14:28,084 --> 00:14:28,640
Eh?

182
00:14:34,823 --> 00:14:36,573
Say, what's the matter?

183
00:14:36,853 --> 00:14:38,654
Aren't you gonna hit me, Dio?

184
00:14:38,873 --> 00:14:41,556
Or don't you care about drinking my blood anymore?

185
00:14:42,783 --> 00:14:47,535
You're running hamon through your body
to protect yourself, quite the strategy.

186
00:14:48,021 --> 00:14:50,107
You've wrapped your body with Hermit Purple,

187
00:14:50,132 --> 00:14:51,782
but you've infused it with hamon,

188
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:54,084
like a cloak of high-voltage wires.

189
00:14:55,079 --> 00:14:56,332
Very clever.

190
00:14:56,392 --> 00:14:58,447
A geriatric genius.

191
00:14:59,092 --> 00:15:01,551
Well, it seems I'm not the only clever one.

192
00:15:03,816 --> 00:15:05,316
It's just like you said.

193
00:15:05,574 --> 00:15:08,729
I've been using this little trick to protect myself.

194
00:15:09,726 --> 00:15:13,714
But thanks to Kakyoin's message,
I've learned something about your stand.

195
00:15:14,067 --> 00:15:16,632
Dio, you can bring time to a standstill,

196
00:15:16,971 --> 00:15:20,158
but there's a limit to the amount
of time you can use that power,

197
00:15:20,463 --> 00:15:22,869
only three to four seconds, I'd say.

198
00:15:23,512 --> 00:15:25,981
If you could do it for a longer period than that,

199
00:15:26,162 --> 00:15:30,897
instead of chasing us around town all night, you
would have wiped us all out back at the mansion.

200
00:15:31,173 --> 00:15:34,274
Tracking us down tells me everything that I need to know.

201
00:15:34,677 --> 00:15:36,811
So you've finally figured it out.

202
00:15:36,836 --> 00:15:38,933
That's an impressive accomplishment.

203
00:15:39,082 --> 00:15:41,451
Ha! Congratulations.

204
00:15:43,675 --> 00:15:45,882
You should congratulate Kakyoin.

205
00:15:46,229 --> 00:15:49,037
He gave his life to give us a fighting chance.

206
00:15:49,225 --> 00:15:51,449
So what? Am I supposed to care?

207
00:15:51,527 --> 00:15:54,248
It doesn't matter if you know my stand's ability.

208
00:15:54,442 --> 00:15:57,772
What can your pathetic hamon do against my power?!

209
00:15:58,818 --> 00:16:01,847
Hermit Purple and hamon!

210
00:16:01,968 --> 00:16:05,761
Idiot! I can kill you with or
without going through your hamon.

211
00:16:11,972 --> 00:16:12,814
Hmm?

212
00:16:13,632 --> 00:16:14,186
Eh?

213
00:16:14,608 --> 00:16:15,944
Hey, what's with him?

214
00:16:15,971 --> 00:16:18,988
I've heard of it raining men, but never old geezers!

215
00:16:19,021 --> 00:16:20,952
Hey, what if he's Santa Claus?

216
00:16:21,072 --> 00:16:23,143
The hell were you doin' on the roof?

217
00:16:23,252 --> 00:16:25,351
Spying on the pretty girls below?

218
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:33,066
Old man.

219
00:16:34,392 --> 00:16:35,966
It's Jotaro.

220
00:16:36,458 --> 00:16:37,535
Stay back!

221
00:16:37,573 --> 00:16:38,054
Mm?

222
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:40,109
You have to stay far away from me!

223
00:16:40,942 --> 00:16:43,723
Jotaro. What good timing.

224
00:16:44,981 --> 00:16:47,964
But he's staying outside of my stand's range,

225
00:16:48,357 --> 00:16:50,215
so Joseph goes first.

226
00:16:52,688 --> 00:16:57,593
Jotaro! Dio's stand, The World,
gives him the ability to control time!

227
00:16:57,626 --> 00:16:59,438
Whatever you do, stay out of it's ran...

228
00:16:59,508 --> 00:17:01,558
Once more, The World!

229
00:17:13,752 --> 00:17:18,788
When I began using this power, I was only
able to freeze time for the blink of an eye.

230
00:17:18,948 --> 00:17:22,456
That said, as my neck began the process of healing,

231
00:17:22,544 --> 00:17:26,798
I found that I could stop time
for two seconds and even three.

232
00:17:30,936 --> 00:17:33,626
Now I can stop time for five seconds.

233
00:17:33,651 --> 00:17:35,503
Then again, time is stopped,

234
00:17:35,595 --> 00:17:39,151
so from my perspective, it only feels like five seconds.

235
00:17:44,187 --> 00:17:47,826
Soon, I'll be able to stop
time for a minute, then an hour,

236
00:17:47,898 --> 00:17:50,501
and later, as long as I desire!

237
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:52,122
How amusing.

238
00:17:52,412 --> 00:17:55,753
I'll have the ability to stop time to my heart's content!

239
00:17:56,672 --> 00:17:58,372
Oh, I almost forgot.

240
00:17:58,473 --> 00:18:01,125
He's covered himself with hamon for protection.

241
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:04,561
A hundred years ago, hamon was a concern.

242
00:18:04,901 --> 00:18:08,367
Now, thanks to The World, it's
little more than an irritation.

243
00:18:12,161 --> 00:18:13,168
Muda! Muda! Muda! Muda!

244
00:18:13,202 --> 00:18:14,303
Muda! Muda! Muda! Muda! Muda!

245
00:18:14,336 --> 00:18:16,769
Muda! Muda! Muda! Muda!

246
00:18:20,276 --> 00:18:24,527
Joseph, grandson of Jonathan, your demise is at hand!

247
00:18:29,899 --> 00:18:31,493
One second left.

248
00:18:34,736 --> 00:18:35,632
Zero.

249
00:18:56,768 --> 00:18:57,730
Old man.

250
00:18:57,755 --> 00:18:59,710
Run away.

251
00:18:59,871 --> 00:19:03,512
G-get out of here, Jotaro.

252
00:19:04,076 --> 00:19:07,622
Don't even try to fight.

253
00:19:09,005 --> 00:19:14,340
Please keep your distance.

254
00:19:15,504 --> 00:19:18,932
Stay far away from him.

255
00:19:21,064 --> 00:19:23,991
He's invincible.

256
00:19:33,165 --> 00:19:35,078
Come now. Don't worry.

257
00:19:35,165 --> 00:19:37,180
At least he's joining Kakyoin.

258
00:19:38,199 --> 00:19:41,052
Polnareff must be hiding around here somewhere,

259
00:19:41,492 --> 00:19:43,667
though I guess it doesn't matter.

260
00:19:46,353 --> 00:19:48,178
You're next, Jotaro.

261
00:19:49,078 --> 00:19:50,612
Time to die.

262
00:19:54,651 --> 00:19:55,836
Damn you.

263
00:19:57,843 --> 00:19:58,531
Dio!

264
00:19:59,311 --> 00:20:01,873
Oh, so you still want to fight?

265
00:20:01,959 --> 00:20:05,061
It would appear pigheadedness runs in the family.

266
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:07,096
How ungrateful can you be?

267
00:20:07,201 --> 00:20:09,923
You're blatantly ignoring your grandfather's wishes,

268
00:20:10,003 --> 00:20:13,878
even after he gave his life to
tell you about the power of the world.

269
00:20:13,945 --> 00:20:17,618
Surely his pathetic pleas
warranted a bit of consideration.

270
00:20:17,852 --> 00:20:21,471
I have to move closer if I wanna
beat your sorry ass to a pulp.

271
00:20:21,504 --> 00:20:22,418
Really?

272
00:20:23,139 --> 00:20:26,161
Okay, then. By all means, come closer.

273
00:20:32,414 --> 00:20:33,521
Ora!

274
00:20:36,811 --> 00:20:38,423
You'll have to be faster.

275
00:20:38,530 --> 00:20:41,418
My stand is more powerful than any other.

276
00:20:41,506 --> 00:20:44,471
Even without the world's tremendous power and speed,

277
00:20:44,537 --> 00:20:47,517
it would still outclass your pitiful Star Platinum.

278
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:50,873
Your stand has a lot in common with my Star Platinum.

279
00:20:51,213 --> 00:20:52,923
We're not long-range fighters,

280
00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:55,238
but we have incredible power and precision.

281
00:20:55,318 --> 00:21:01,660
If I'm being honest, I've always had a desire to see how
much stronger the world is compared with Star Platinum,

282
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:05,191
but it seems pointless to compare them now.

283
00:21:05,258 --> 00:21:06,904
Wait. Are you serious?

284
00:21:07,011 --> 00:21:10,012
All you did was give me a love tap on the leg,

285
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:12,789
and you ripped my 20,000-yen pants.

286
00:21:13,348 --> 00:21:17,563
For the life of me, I can't figure
out why you Joestars are so stubborn.

287
00:21:17,863 --> 00:21:20,971
Fine. I shall accept your cheap provocation.

288
00:21:21,006 --> 00:21:22,982
Let our comparison resume.

289
00:21:30,001 --> 00:21:32,188
Ora! Ora!

290
00:21:39,230 --> 00:21:41,258
Comparing our punching speed?

291
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:43,853
Muda! Muda! Muda! Muda! Muda! Muda!

292
00:21:43,877 --> 00:21:48,342
Ora! Ora! Ora! Ora! Ora! Ora!...
