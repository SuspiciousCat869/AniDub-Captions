1
00:00:01,446 --> 00:00:01,866
Hey!

2
00:00:02,269 --> 00:00:03,753
Something's coming this way!

3
00:00:11,437 --> 00:00:14,152
I don't know who you are, but
you're definitely not normal!

4
00:00:14,218 --> 00:00:15,219
Polnareff, stop it!

5
00:00:15,251 --> 00:00:16,847
I'm gonna make short work of you.

6
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:22,696
Another playing card?

7
00:00:22,743 --> 00:00:25,269
Master Joestar, welcome to our abode.

8
00:00:25,369 --> 00:00:26,610
We've been expecting you.

9
00:00:27,138 --> 00:00:28,199
How rude of me.

10
00:00:28,519 --> 00:00:30,197
I am the Butler of this mansion.

11
00:00:31,065 --> 00:00:32,812
You may call me Darby.

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,020
Darby, huh?

13
00:00:35,246 --> 00:00:37,525
Yes. I am the younger Darby.

14
00:00:37,826 --> 00:00:42,508
It might interest you to know the Darby
whom you defeated upon your arrival was...

15
00:00:43,209 --> 00:00:44,591
My older brother.

16
00:00:45,958 --> 00:00:48,919
So there isn't just one filou in the Darby family!

17
00:00:48,974 --> 00:00:51,869
So I take it you're here to avenge your brother's defeat?

18
00:00:56,789 --> 00:00:58,320
No, not at all.

19
00:00:58,345 --> 00:01:00,275
Such a thing is beneath me.

20
00:01:01,041 --> 00:01:04,589
I would have assumed my brother
would share his motto with you...

21
00:01:04,942 --> 00:01:08,428
"It is the deceived, not the
deceiver, who holds the blame."

22
00:01:08,996 --> 00:01:10,805
I, too, live by this adage.

23
00:01:10,857 --> 00:01:13,318
My brother lost, so he is the wrongdoer.

24
00:01:13,713 --> 00:01:16,257
I harbor no ill will toward any of you.

25
00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:21,375
My brother is my brother, and I
am me, two different individuals.

26
00:01:21,621 --> 00:01:24,338
You see, my brother and I were born ten years apart,

27
00:01:24,391 --> 00:01:26,825
and while I did look up to him to a certain extent,

28
00:01:26,874 --> 00:01:29,571
he and I are of different generations.

29
00:01:29,844 --> 00:01:33,071
My brother tried to win via old-fashioned deception,

30
00:01:33,347 --> 00:01:37,837
but this method is only useful against
those who are outdated or inexperienced.

31
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:40,935
Master Dio realized this sad truth as well,

32
00:01:41,194 --> 00:01:44,334
which is why he kept me by
his side as his personal Butler.

33
00:01:45,682 --> 00:01:48,089
Hmm. Forgive me. Is something the matter?

34
00:01:49,342 --> 00:01:50,940
Here is my offer to you.

35
00:01:51,211 --> 00:01:52,702
If you wish to fight me,

36
00:01:53,266 --> 00:01:55,832
then I invite you to enter our manor.

37
00:01:56,068 --> 00:01:58,880
Stay on guard. He's even more
conniving than his brother.

38
00:01:58,918 --> 00:02:00,555
There's no time for games.

39
00:02:00,599 --> 00:02:02,248
Take us to Dio right now.

40
00:02:02,648 --> 00:02:04,429
Jotaro, stay on your guard!

41
00:02:04,454 --> 00:02:05,736
He's up to something!

42
00:02:06,417 --> 00:02:07,671
Darby younger.

43
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:12,058
His stand, hailing from the Egyptian pantheon, is Atum.

44
00:02:14,847 --> 00:02:17,463
Hey, guys, he just brought out his stand.

45
00:02:17,557 --> 00:02:19,583
It's been a while since we've seen one.

46
00:02:19,632 --> 00:02:22,432
Indeed. His stand is physically showing itself.

47
00:02:22,562 --> 00:02:25,928
I'll let you decide. Who shall be my first opponent?

48
00:02:26,005 --> 00:02:27,543
As if we'd listen to you.

49
00:02:27,717 --> 00:02:29,983
Jotaro, take this weirdo down.

50
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:35,363
Let's see.

51
00:02:35,508 --> 00:02:38,491
I'll wager that star platinum's first attack will...

52
00:02:38,765 --> 00:02:40,253
Be with his left arm.

53
00:02:43,327 --> 00:02:45,222
Oh, and it'll be a punch.

54
00:02:45,318 --> 00:02:47,106
How much would you care to bet?

55
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:48,412
Forget this.

56
00:02:48,436 --> 00:02:51,030
Which arm doesn't matter. One punch will finish it.

57
00:02:51,144 --> 00:02:51,816
Get him!

58
00:02:52,679 --> 00:02:54,920
Let him have it already, Jotaro!

59
00:02:55,482 --> 00:02:57,403
Ora!

60
00:02:59,458 --> 00:03:00,005
What?

61
00:03:00,286 --> 00:03:01,678
He was able to dodge it.

62
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:03,484
His speed is insane.

63
00:03:03,509 --> 00:03:04,637
Impossible.

64
00:03:08,307 --> 00:03:10,574
Well, that's a bit of bad luck.

65
00:03:10,804 --> 00:03:13,365
Regrettably, it appears as though I've lost the bet.

66
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:18,506
Like my brother, I also enjoy a round
of gambling, but luck is never on my side.

67
00:03:19,261 --> 00:03:22,994
Allow me to take you to a wonderful world to apologize.

68
00:03:24,524 --> 00:03:26,148
What? A pit?

69
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:28,525
Damn it! It was all subterfuge.

70
00:03:28,568 --> 00:03:30,634
Jotaro!

71
00:03:32,112 --> 00:03:34,046
He's falling into the abyss!

72
00:03:34,231 --> 00:03:36,439
We have to get him out of there!

73
00:03:38,374 --> 00:03:39,631
Have it your way.

74
00:03:39,891 --> 00:03:42,115
The more the merrier, and all that.

75
00:03:42,816 --> 00:03:45,294
Mr. Joestar, Kakyoin, no!

76
00:03:45,732 --> 00:03:47,822
It's too dangerous for us to follow.

77
00:03:47,993 --> 00:03:50,662
Avdol, can you hear me?!

78
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:54,797
If you don't hear from us in
ten minutes, torch the mansion!

79
00:03:54,847 --> 00:03:56,402
Do you understand me?!

80
00:03:56,755 --> 00:03:59,327
Burn it to the ground, Avdol!

81
00:03:59,393 --> 00:04:01,200
Mr. Joestar!

82
00:04:09,498 --> 00:04:10,506
Mm.

83
00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:12,006
Mm.

84
00:04:16,313 --> 00:04:17,955
Is this an illusion?

85
00:04:18,062 --> 00:04:20,994
Are we still aboveground, or did he pull us under?

86
00:04:21,407 --> 00:04:21,954
Huh?

87
00:04:23,605 --> 00:04:24,118
Huh?

88
00:04:25,415 --> 00:04:27,363
If this stuff is really an illusion,

89
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:30,695
they've got water down. This stuff feels so real.

90
00:04:30,807 --> 00:04:33,255
What the hell is this guy trying to accomplish here?

91
00:04:33,288 --> 00:04:33,807
Hmm?

92
00:04:33,924 --> 00:04:34,480
Eh?

93
00:04:42,568 --> 00:04:44,090
Old man, Kakyoin,

94
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:46,393
see if you can figure out his ability.

95
00:04:46,973 --> 00:04:47,916
His stand,

96
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:51,265
it knew without a doubt that I
would throw a right-handed punch.

97
00:04:51,945 --> 00:04:52,999
Do you know why?

98
00:04:53,391 --> 00:04:54,091
Hmm.

99
00:04:54,910 --> 00:04:58,344
If we can't figure it out soon, we're gonna lose.

100
00:04:58,438 --> 00:04:59,331
No doubt.

101
00:05:00,184 --> 00:05:02,108
Would you care to wet your whistle?

102
00:05:02,315 --> 00:05:04,861
They're real, and I assure you they're not poisoned.

103
00:05:05,147 --> 00:05:06,922
Cross my heart and hope to die.

104
00:05:06,947 --> 00:05:09,613
Just answer this. Are we inside the mansion?

105
00:05:09,653 --> 00:05:10,960
Yes, of course.

106
00:05:11,612 --> 00:05:13,334
Where in the mansion are we?

107
00:05:13,408 --> 00:05:14,962
I can't tell you that.

108
00:05:15,043 --> 00:05:16,091
The basement?

109
00:05:16,323 --> 00:05:17,370
Perhaps.

110
00:05:17,828 --> 00:05:18,404
Hmm.

111
00:05:21,014 --> 00:05:23,585
Is this illusion the work of a stand's power?

112
00:05:23,637 --> 00:05:24,846
Yes, it is.

113
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:27,341
Is all this the doing of your stand?

114
00:05:27,421 --> 00:05:28,682
No, it isn't.

115
00:05:28,776 --> 00:05:30,211
Is it Dio's stand?

116
00:05:30,236 --> 00:05:31,062
No, it isn't.

117
00:05:31,142 --> 00:05:32,352
Whose stand, then?!

118
00:05:32,414 --> 00:05:34,215
I would rather not reveal that.

119
00:05:34,688 --> 00:05:39,793
The Speedwagon Foundation has reported
there are two to three more stand users.

120
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,481
Is that accurate?

121
00:05:41,775 --> 00:05:43,856
I'd rather not reveal that either.

122
00:05:44,756 --> 00:05:48,191
Well, you're about as helpful as a cramp in a relay race.

123
00:05:48,275 --> 00:05:50,739
If it means so much, I could lie to you,

124
00:05:50,917 --> 00:05:55,580
but unlike my dearly defeated brother,
I'd prefer not to resort to petty trickery.

125
00:05:57,821 --> 00:05:59,823
Let me make sure I've got this straight.

126
00:05:59,866 --> 00:06:03,731
You're saying if we don't defeat you, we
won't be able to get back to the real world?

127
00:06:04,401 --> 00:06:06,716
Heh. Exactly right.

128
00:06:06,883 --> 00:06:08,874
You've pieced it together, good sir.

129
00:06:09,169 --> 00:06:13,363
That obnoxious, gentlemanly demeanor
is beginning to wear thin on my nerves.

130
00:06:13,911 --> 00:06:16,649
You seem to be forgetting that it's three against one.

131
00:06:16,674 --> 00:06:20,566
We're short on time, so you'll have to
deal with all of us attacking at once.

132
00:06:20,652 --> 00:06:22,974
Come now, friends. You should take a load off.

133
00:06:23,627 --> 00:06:26,466
Feast your eyes on what I have to show you.

134
00:06:27,855 --> 00:06:30,054
Say hello to my collection.

135
00:06:30,283 --> 00:06:31,500
Your collection?

136
00:06:41,797 --> 00:06:45,927
Much like my brother, I'm what you
might call a humble collector of sorts.

137
00:06:47,241 --> 00:06:52,263
My, thinking about it, all collectors must yearn
to share their treasures for that moment of praise.

138
00:06:52,349 --> 00:06:54,165
He's out of his mind.

139
00:06:54,191 --> 00:06:55,188
Why dolls?

140
00:06:55,625 --> 00:06:58,012
What could he possibly be doing with these toys?

141
00:06:58,045 --> 00:06:59,552
I don't think I wanna know.

142
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:04,013
Remember, this guy is Darby's brother, so
I'm guessing those aren't ordinary dolls.

143
00:07:09,719 --> 00:07:13,261
D-Darby.

144
00:07:13,475 --> 00:07:15,320
Talk to me. Please talk.

145
00:07:15,403 --> 00:07:18,520
Why won't you talk to me? Darby!

146
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,271
Talk to me.

147
00:07:23,436 --> 00:07:24,459
Help me.

148
00:07:24,544 --> 00:07:25,851
I'm trapped.

149
00:07:25,957 --> 00:07:28,110
Oh, my god.

150
00:07:28,251 --> 00:07:30,898
They're alive. How is that even possible?

151
00:07:31,007 --> 00:07:33,517
Bastard. You took their souls.

152
00:07:33,684 --> 00:07:36,436
Obviously, as making dolls is my hobby.

153
00:07:36,496 --> 00:07:41,057
But of course ordinary doll makers cannot
imbue their handiwork with human souls.

154
00:07:41,082 --> 00:07:44,872
I suppose I may be giving too much
away, but that's my stand's ability.

155
00:07:45,093 --> 00:07:50,756
Comparatively, my brother's collection of
simple coins made of souls is rather uninspired.

156
00:07:51,316 --> 00:07:55,054
With my collection, you can play
dress up and have actual chats.

157
00:07:55,175 --> 00:07:56,145
Let me show you.

158
00:07:56,850 --> 00:07:59,393
This little showstopper is named Sonia.

159
00:07:59,546 --> 00:08:02,669
She can wax poetic about her passionate love stories.

160
00:08:02,715 --> 00:08:05,130
Such exquisite skin.

161
00:08:05,349 --> 00:08:07,171
Anyone would be proud to own her.

162
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:11,679
Dr. Elliott is a serial killer
with a victim count of eight.

163
00:08:11,848 --> 00:08:15,341
He'll tell you all about the patients he's exterminated.

164
00:08:15,753 --> 00:08:17,966
I made the glasses and stethoscope myself.

165
00:08:18,294 --> 00:08:19,886
Oh, I nearly forgot.

166
00:08:20,192 --> 00:08:22,201
I'd like for you to meet Tatsuhiko.

167
00:08:22,412 --> 00:08:24,649
This one's a game expert from Japan.

168
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:29,894
This brilliant young man was a
formidable opponent with an I.IQ. Of 190.

169
00:08:30,209 --> 00:08:34,237
Let me tell you, it wasn't easy beating
this little guy and stealing his soul.

170
00:08:34,262 --> 00:08:36,763
You're just as messed up in the head as your brother.

171
00:08:36,816 --> 00:08:39,913
Actually, you're more sadistic than your brother ever was.

172
00:08:39,973 --> 00:08:41,862
I hate to see what your parents were like.

173
00:08:41,906 --> 00:08:44,858
I'm out of Patience with this sociopath's puppet show.

174
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:46,226
He makes me sick.

175
00:08:46,925 --> 00:08:47,766
By the way,

176
00:08:48,263 --> 00:08:51,312
I'm fairly certain you learned
this when you fought my brother,

177
00:08:51,345 --> 00:08:54,434
but the human soul can be a rather mysterious entity.

178
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:56,557
The moment a person admits defeat,

179
00:08:56,696 --> 00:08:58,314
their inner spirit dies,

180
00:08:58,627 --> 00:09:01,340
and the soul loses almost all vitality.

181
00:09:01,936 --> 00:09:05,714
At that moment, I have the power
to rip the soul from the body,

182
00:09:05,806 --> 00:09:09,213
and that's the fundamental mechanism of our stands!

183
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:10,549
I've heard enough!

184
00:09:10,968 --> 00:09:12,399
Show and tell is over!

185
00:09:12,526 --> 00:09:15,816
We're gonna beat you to a bloody
pulp and get the hell out of here!

186
00:09:15,916 --> 00:09:18,122
But first listen to what I have to say.

187
00:09:18,722 --> 00:09:22,919
Surely the fact that you're under
my control hasn't escaped your notice.

188
00:09:24,394 --> 00:09:30,484
Jotaro, as I recall, you were quite shocked when I
knew exactly which arm you were going to attack me with,

189
00:09:30,537 --> 00:09:34,079
and from where I'm standing, it
seems you still haven't figured it out.

190
00:09:34,272 --> 00:09:38,680
You were shaken by my prowess, and I was
able to give your soul a little love tap.

191
00:09:38,947 --> 00:09:41,694
What do you think I did when I touched your soul?

192
00:09:47,268 --> 00:09:48,608
W-What the...

193
00:09:49,063 --> 00:09:50,899
The hell'd you do to his arm?

194
00:09:51,059 --> 00:09:54,942
I've done nothing but embed
Atum's hand inside Jotaro's soul.

195
00:09:55,156 --> 00:09:59,901
I could crush your right arm with a thought
and, in doing so, make master Dio very happy,

196
00:10:00,447 --> 00:10:06,024
but if I did, I wouldn't be able to defend myself against
Kakyoin and Joseph and would most certainly perish.

197
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:10,022
Now, we wouldn't want that to happen, would we, gentlemen?

198
00:10:12,417 --> 00:10:14,029
So here's a suggestion.

199
00:10:14,054 --> 00:10:17,255
Everyone, let's play a game with our souls as collateral.

200
00:10:17,363 --> 00:10:17,862
What?

201
00:10:18,485 --> 00:10:19,677
If you defeat me,

202
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:22,372
I solemnly swear to release Jotaro's arm.

203
00:10:23,709 --> 00:10:25,042
Ah, good grief.

204
00:10:25,165 --> 00:10:27,981
So, according to you, I'm already under your control.

205
00:10:28,082 --> 00:10:30,751
Well, I have news for you, Darby.

206
00:10:30,891 --> 00:10:33,593
You're gonna regret picking a
fight with me and my friends.

207
00:10:33,754 --> 00:10:34,955
Let's end this!

208
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:38,133
Yes, yes, your righteous anger is all well and good,

209
00:10:38,157 --> 00:10:41,753
but I'd rather hear you say the
words, "I'll bet my soul on this game."

210
00:10:41,821 --> 00:10:44,927
By the way, I have another request, if you'd indulge me.

211
00:10:44,951 --> 00:10:45,365
Eh?

212
00:10:45,719 --> 00:10:46,449
Kakyoin...

213
00:10:46,611 --> 00:10:46,954
Hmm?

214
00:10:46,987 --> 00:10:48,620
You shall be my first opponent.

215
00:10:49,386 --> 00:10:51,499
Hey, what are you talking about?

216
00:10:51,638 --> 00:10:55,046
Your fight is with me, buddy, so
don't try and pass the buck to Kakyoin.

217
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:57,286
You and Mr. Joestar are family,

218
00:10:57,618 --> 00:11:00,034
but Kakyoin is decidedly not.

219
00:11:00,263 --> 00:11:02,773
I'd prefer Kakyoin not back out of our arrangement

220
00:11:02,798 --> 00:11:06,063
and attack me with his stand
after I've taken both of your souls,

221
00:11:06,088 --> 00:11:08,332
due to lack of familial attachment.

222
00:11:09,303 --> 00:11:11,268
I'm sick of this arrogant prick.

223
00:11:11,293 --> 00:11:14,143
He thinks this challenge is
gonna be a walk in the park for him.

224
00:11:14,768 --> 00:11:18,521
Very well. If that's what you
want, then I will be your opponent.

225
00:11:18,546 --> 00:11:19,246
Say what?

226
00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:20,214
Kakyoin.

227
00:11:20,745 --> 00:11:23,360
It's okay. I'm really not too concerned.

228
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:26,930
I've probably played more video
games than anyone else here.

229
00:11:28,098 --> 00:11:32,266
I officially accept your challenge
and choose "f-mega" as our game.

230
00:11:36,164 --> 00:11:37,996
And I'll wager my soul.

231
00:11:45,649 --> 00:11:47,795
And I'll wager my soul.

232
00:11:48,501 --> 00:11:49,734
Very good.

233
00:11:50,968 --> 00:11:51,903
Kakyoin, don't!

234
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:54,480
There's no need for you to take this guy on first.

235
00:11:54,858 --> 00:11:56,262
I have to do this.

236
00:11:56,452 --> 00:11:59,001
We still don't have a grasp on that spirit hand.

237
00:11:59,207 --> 00:12:01,234
It could hinder your game-playing ability.

238
00:12:01,514 --> 00:12:07,302
Darby, do I have your guarantee that you'll release
Jotaro from your stand's power if you lose the game?

239
00:12:09,948 --> 00:12:10,533
Huh?

240
00:12:32,563 --> 00:12:35,666
The TV, console, and game cartridges are all good.

241
00:12:35,927 --> 00:12:39,004
As far as I can tell, this is just an ordinary setup.

242
00:12:39,166 --> 00:12:42,691
I keep trying to tell you that
I'm not a cheater like my brother.

243
00:12:44,438 --> 00:12:46,126
If you're ready, let's begin.

244
00:12:46,986 --> 00:12:47,974
Let's do it.

245
00:12:56,299 --> 00:12:57,535
"F-mega"!

246
00:13:01,215 --> 00:13:02,674
Select your car.

247
00:13:03,253 --> 00:13:05,529
Go ahead, and select your vehicle.

248
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:06,735
Right.

249
00:13:10,366 --> 00:13:12,836
So you've decided to go with number 28.

250
00:13:12,862 --> 00:13:16,986
I suppose I'll be number 15,
as my birthday is January fifth.

251
00:13:19,318 --> 00:13:21,184
We can begin at your leisure.

252
00:13:21,238 --> 00:13:22,541
Enough with the courtesy.

253
00:13:22,618 --> 00:13:24,161
Start the game already.

254
00:13:28,331 --> 00:13:29,755
Race starts in...

255
00:13:29,946 --> 00:13:30,592
Five...

256
00:13:38,137 --> 00:13:41,091
He's button mashing the
accelerator at an incredible speed.

257
00:13:41,298 --> 00:13:42,976
He's going for a turbo start.

258
00:13:43,349 --> 00:13:44,015
Three...

259
00:13:44,721 --> 00:13:45,321
Damn.

260
00:13:45,568 --> 00:13:47,477
I don't have time to try the same tactic.

261
00:13:47,636 --> 00:13:50,397
He'll take the lead. What am I going to do now?

262
00:13:51,138 --> 00:13:51,666
One...

263
00:13:53,608 --> 00:13:54,754
Start!

264
00:14:15,262 --> 00:14:17,164
What? He just cut me off.

265
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:20,946
As long as I'm in the lead, he can't beat me,

266
00:14:21,024 --> 00:14:23,639
and I've made it impossible for him to pass.

267
00:14:24,281 --> 00:14:29,417
It's unfortunate, I know, but the simple
truth is I never make a mistake during a race.

268
00:14:29,498 --> 00:14:31,788
Victory will be mine, Kakyoin.

269
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:39,414
What the...

270
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:49,174
Kakyoin, you've played this game before, haven't you?

271
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:50,993
I'd rather not reveal that.

272
00:14:51,073 --> 00:14:53,857
Yes! This is your chance, Kakyoin.

273
00:14:53,928 --> 00:14:57,537
Get your machine back on course,
and start kicking this bastard's ass!

274
00:14:59,237 --> 00:15:00,272
That technique,

275
00:15:00,477 --> 00:15:03,787
one doesn't simply get those
skills by playing video games.

276
00:15:04,055 --> 00:15:09,396
Damn it all. I never could have imagined that someone
as measured as Kakyoin would make such a bold move.

277
00:15:18,995 --> 00:15:21,228
Yeah, that's the way to do it, neck and neck!

278
00:15:21,341 --> 00:15:23,467
No. Look carefully, old man.

279
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:24,816
Kakyoin's at the edge.

280
00:15:25,196 --> 00:15:26,762
When it comes to those turns,

281
00:15:26,855 --> 00:15:28,641
he's at a major disadvantage.

282
00:15:29,616 --> 00:15:31,341
355 k.M.H.

283
00:15:31,734 --> 00:15:33,146
Now it's 358...

284
00:15:33,333 --> 00:15:34,660
And now 360.

285
00:15:34,827 --> 00:15:36,620
Three seconds until the first turn,

286
00:15:36,799 --> 00:15:39,116
but there's no way I can make it going this fast.

287
00:15:39,449 --> 00:15:41,371
I'm entering the turn at full speed!

288
00:15:41,904 --> 00:15:43,586
Two, one!

289
00:15:52,702 --> 00:15:56,182
You seeing this? Those two are
hitting the turns the exact same way.

290
00:15:56,214 --> 00:15:57,483
It's too close to call.

291
00:15:57,508 --> 00:15:59,335
You've intrigued me, Kakyoin.

292
00:15:59,555 --> 00:16:04,741
With your soul on the line, you've conquered your
fear and become the picture of unwavering resolve.

293
00:16:05,234 --> 00:16:08,744
I dare say you'll make a worthy addition to my collection.

294
00:16:08,884 --> 00:16:11,336
All that's left is for me to win.

295
00:16:12,611 --> 00:16:14,464
Kakyoin thought to himself...

296
00:16:14,894 --> 00:16:17,399
So I've conquered my fears, have I?

297
00:16:18,697 --> 00:16:19,703
Why, thank you.

298
00:16:20,616 --> 00:16:21,822
It's been a long road.

299
00:16:22,342 --> 00:16:26,839
Six months ago, I had the unfortunate
experience of meeting your master, Dio.

300
00:16:27,412 --> 00:16:31,020
I was terrified when he implanted
one of his flesh buds in my brain.

301
00:16:32,121 --> 00:16:34,456
My memories of that day are as clear as ever.

302
00:16:35,001 --> 00:16:38,787
I remember the horror I felt in
my soul as I faced that monster.

303
00:16:39,102 --> 00:16:42,248
My legs wouldn't move. Every
hair on my body stood on end.

304
00:16:42,298 --> 00:16:43,776
It's like I was frozen.

305
00:16:44,173 --> 00:16:45,543
That's when I realized it.

306
00:16:45,764 --> 00:16:48,284
I was helpless, completely at his mercy.

307
00:16:48,564 --> 00:16:52,430
The mere sight of Dio was enough
to turn my own body against itself.

308
00:16:52,634 --> 00:16:53,985
My stomach was in knots.

309
00:16:54,009 --> 00:16:57,484
I was so close to vomiting,
I could taste bile in the back of my throat.

310
00:16:58,012 --> 00:16:59,596
Dio gazed down at me,

311
00:16:59,827 --> 00:17:03,571
and, as if tenderly calming a frightened child, he said...

312
00:17:03,717 --> 00:17:05,274
Easy, Kakyoin.

313
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:08,751
There is nothing for you to be afraid of.

314
00:17:09,176 --> 00:17:11,184
Let's be friends, shall we?

315
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:13,296
I still curse myself.

316
00:17:13,529 --> 00:17:15,231
I heard his words, and...

317
00:17:18,508 --> 00:17:21,207
and I felt all of my anxiety melt away.

318
00:17:21,507 --> 00:17:23,902
I was completely and utterly relieved.

319
00:17:24,347 --> 00:17:27,252
I thought, "I still have a chance to live."

320
00:17:28,343 --> 00:17:29,611
It was humiliating.

321
00:17:29,636 --> 00:17:31,646
I'll never forgive him for what he did,

322
00:17:32,154 --> 00:17:35,408
and I'll never forgive myself for
submitting to that bastard's will.

323
00:17:35,573 --> 00:17:38,384
My weakness will forever be my greatest failure.

324
00:17:39,206 --> 00:17:41,147
Jotaro saved me from that hell,

325
00:17:41,172 --> 00:17:42,934
which is why I've come on this journey.

326
00:17:43,212 --> 00:17:46,055
I will never again allow myself to be such a coward.

327
00:17:46,377 --> 00:17:51,181
And that, Darby, is why I'm able to fight
you, even with my very soul on the line.

328
00:17:53,794 --> 00:17:56,242
Three, two, one!

329
00:17:57,723 --> 00:17:59,098
They're neck and neck again,

330
00:17:59,451 --> 00:18:00,931
rounding the third corner!

331
00:18:01,371 --> 00:18:05,272
That is why on this day I vow that I, Noriaki Kakyoin,

332
00:18:05,332 --> 00:18:07,630
will never be controlled by my fears again.

333
00:18:08,478 --> 00:18:10,033
My word is my bond.

334
00:18:10,233 --> 00:18:12,387
All right! It's the fifth corner!

335
00:18:12,412 --> 00:18:13,660
They're back in sync!

336
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:15,680
Look! They're turning at the same speed!

337
00:18:15,915 --> 00:18:17,585
Damn you, Kakyoin.

338
00:18:17,944 --> 00:18:18,846
Damn you.

339
00:18:18,871 --> 00:18:20,996
The sixth corner is coming up fast.

340
00:18:21,623 --> 00:18:24,984
If I'm not mistaken, the speed
tunnel comes right after turn six.

341
00:18:25,871 --> 00:18:30,480
If you enter that tunnel, you're granted a
boost that can double your Max speed to 850 k.M.H.

342
00:18:30,687 --> 00:18:32,815
I have to make sure I get to that tunnel.

343
00:18:33,513 --> 00:18:36,771
But the thing is, the tunnel
is only wide enough for one car.

344
00:18:37,691 --> 00:18:38,832
This isn't good.

345
00:18:38,864 --> 00:18:42,374
If they try to enter the tunnel side
by side, one of them is gonna crash.

346
00:18:42,614 --> 00:18:43,939
It's the sixth turn,

347
00:18:44,072 --> 00:18:45,960
and they're still neck and neck!

348
00:18:48,844 --> 00:18:50,963
There it is! I see the tunnel!

349
00:18:52,889 --> 00:18:53,802
Kakyoin,

350
00:18:53,861 --> 00:18:55,242
push him out of the way!

351
00:18:56,504 --> 00:18:58,559
Haven't you realized it yet, Kakyoin?

352
00:18:58,912 --> 00:19:01,100
You don't have the power to push me aside.

353
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:04,760
If you don't believe me, why not
glance at your handy-dandy power meter?

354
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:05,320
Hmm?

355
00:19:07,556 --> 00:19:10,151
Kakyoin, you have less power than he does.

356
00:19:10,218 --> 00:19:14,597
You used up your power when you spun around
and blocked me back at the beginning of the race.

357
00:19:15,023 --> 00:19:17,075
That wasn't the best move on your part.

358
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:19,466
I bet you're regretting that decision now!

359
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:28,892
So close. Two seconds 'til the tunnel.

360
00:19:29,158 --> 00:19:30,567
You're gonna crash!

361
00:19:30,614 --> 00:19:32,249
You can let this fool have the lead!

362
00:19:32,282 --> 00:19:34,486
Get behind him to avoid crashing right now!

363
00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:35,792
I can't do that.

364
00:19:35,816 --> 00:19:37,392
If he makes it to the tunnel first,

365
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:39,867
my chances of winning go to absolute zero.

366
00:19:39,913 --> 00:19:41,492
One second left 'til victory.

367
00:19:41,529 --> 00:19:42,438
Kakyoin!

368
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:49,004
My god! He's got the car up on two wheels!

369
00:19:51,628 --> 00:19:54,659
How absurd. You're riding the tunnel walls?

370
00:19:54,754 --> 00:19:56,606
Yes. You've got this in the bag, Kakyoin.

371
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:59,463
Just hang on a little bit
further, and victory will be ours.

372
00:19:59,523 --> 00:20:00,834
Now push him aside!

373
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:02,771
Quiet. I'm concentrating.

374
00:20:07,491 --> 00:20:09,084
Watch out! He's slamming you!

375
00:20:09,789 --> 00:20:12,209
It makes no difference to me if I lose some power.

376
00:20:12,347 --> 00:20:15,832
My only concern is getting around
that turn faster than Kakyoin,

377
00:20:15,871 --> 00:20:18,142
even if it's only by a hundredth of a second,

378
00:20:18,468 --> 00:20:20,937
just one one-thousandth of a millimeter ahead.

379
00:20:23,054 --> 00:20:24,093
No radar.

380
00:20:24,908 --> 00:20:26,739
Hey, what's going on here?

381
00:20:26,819 --> 00:20:28,086
Can't see the cars!

382
00:20:28,304 --> 00:20:31,819
From here on out, we have to get through
the tunnel in almost absolute darkness.

383
00:20:31,843 --> 00:20:32,442
What?

384
00:20:32,813 --> 00:20:35,492
The problem is my radar will be completely useless,

385
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:37,886
and worse, there are eight turns,

386
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:41,672
a land mine, and a Cannon attack waiting
to put us through our paces up ahead.

387
00:20:41,772 --> 00:20:44,398
This area will remain dark until we make it out.

388
00:20:44,653 --> 00:20:46,644
One mistake, and I'll slam into the wall.

389
00:20:46,844 --> 00:20:50,507
But, fortunately for us, I already
know exactly where each turn is.

390
00:20:50,807 --> 00:20:52,087
Darby knows, too.

391
00:20:57,210 --> 00:20:59,118
The cars are beginning to turn.

392
00:21:13,783 --> 00:21:15,285
What's happening, Jotaro?!

393
00:21:15,310 --> 00:21:18,306
I can't tell who's ahead or where
they are in that blasted tunnel!

394
00:21:19,019 --> 00:21:19,456
Three...

395
00:21:19,481 --> 00:21:19,914
Eh?

396
00:21:20,474 --> 00:21:20,969
Two...

397
00:21:20,993 --> 00:21:21,430
Huh?

398
00:21:21,916 --> 00:21:23,815
And one! Cannon attack!

399
00:21:28,841 --> 00:21:29,766
Did you see that?

400
00:21:29,799 --> 00:21:32,046
For a second there, the blast lit up the cars.

401
00:21:32,319 --> 00:21:35,372
Yeah, I could see that Kakyoin is running slightly behind.

402
00:21:38,183 --> 00:21:38,964
Here we go.

403
00:21:39,231 --> 00:21:40,913
They're about to exit the tunnel!

404
00:21:45,631 --> 00:21:48,075
Oh, damn it! Darby was able to take the lead!

405
00:21:48,182 --> 00:21:50,188
He's ahead by a full car length!

406
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:52,170
Looks like I win.
