1
00:01:31,051 --> 00:01:32,738
Let's rewind a little bit.

2
00:01:33,514 --> 00:01:35,962
While Joseph and Avdol were battling Mariah,

3
00:01:36,108 --> 00:01:37,918
Jotaro and Polnareff were...

4
00:01:40,633 --> 00:01:42,142
And here's your drink, ma'am,

5
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:45,450
a super-duper tall glass of whiskey and soda on the rocks.

6
00:01:45,475 --> 00:01:46,363
Enjoy.

7
00:01:46,622 --> 00:01:48,538
It looks delicious.

8
00:01:49,058 --> 00:01:52,266
Gulp-gulp, gulp-gulp, gulp-gulp, gulp.

9
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:55,693
Oh, my. Somebody's dying to
quench her thirst early this morning.

10
00:01:55,717 --> 00:01:56,598
Scandalous.

11
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:58,491
Darling, how you do go on.

12
00:01:58,533 --> 00:02:02,474
My husband's gone away on a business
trip and won't return for another week.

13
00:02:03,776 --> 00:02:06,326
In that case, how about enjoying a piece of cake?

14
00:02:06,415 --> 00:02:08,041
Oh, don't trouble yourself, dear.

15
00:02:08,107 --> 00:02:09,433
I'm quite all right.

16
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:13,933
Kids are great, huh? So innocent.

17
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:16,027
Hey, it's almost 9 A.M.

18
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:20,943
The old man and Avdol are taking way too long.

19
00:02:21,097 --> 00:02:21,934
Mm.

20
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:24,420
They may have had a run-in with the enemy.

21
00:02:24,566 --> 00:02:26,813
You think we should see where they ran off to?

22
00:02:26,882 --> 00:02:29,235
I guess. Ah, good grief.

23
00:02:29,548 --> 00:02:31,122
It's time to go, Iggy.

24
00:02:33,269 --> 00:02:37,487
Yeah, yeah, I know you're hungry.
You're not the only one, believe me.

25
00:02:39,642 --> 00:02:42,163
Hey, Iggy,
where in the world do you think you're going?

26
00:02:42,188 --> 00:02:43,877
Jeez, what a stupid mutt.

27
00:02:44,345 --> 00:02:45,206
Let's go.

28
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:45,654
Hmm?

29
00:02:50,792 --> 00:02:51,766
Hey!

30
00:02:52,711 --> 00:02:55,533
Make some room, would you? I wanna play, too!

31
00:02:55,579 --> 00:02:58,118
No way we'd ever play with a jerk like you.

32
00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:00,371
Oh, yeah? You guys are the jerks around...

33
00:03:02,444 --> 00:03:05,208
Ah, man, that really hurt. Mm?

34
00:03:20,147 --> 00:03:21,371
Uh...

35
00:03:23,964 --> 00:03:26,867
Attaboy. You didn't shed a single tear.

36
00:03:26,892 --> 00:03:28,140
That's impressive.

37
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:30,085
You sure you're okay?

38
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:33,553
So, kid, how old are you?

39
00:03:34,452 --> 00:03:35,827
Uh... F...

40
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:38,074
Four years old, hmm?

41
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:40,673
Attaboy.

42
00:03:40,936 --> 00:03:43,650
What about your daddy? Where is he now?

43
00:03:44,763 --> 00:03:46,128
Uh, he's at work.

44
00:03:46,153 --> 00:03:47,116
I see.

45
00:03:47,149 --> 00:03:50,397
So your daddy's at work, is he? Attaboy to you.

46
00:03:50,619 --> 00:03:52,505
And where's your mommy?

47
00:03:52,681 --> 00:03:54,648
She's at home doing laundry.

48
00:03:55,131 --> 00:03:56,623
Attaboy.

49
00:03:56,730 --> 00:03:59,182
So you came here all by yourself?

50
00:03:59,355 --> 00:04:00,089
Mm-hmm.

51
00:04:01,481 --> 00:04:05,965
Good! Then there's no one around to stop me
from bashing your face in for ruining my pants!

52
00:04:06,025 --> 00:04:07,896
You gonna pay to get the mud cleaned off?!

53
00:04:07,921 --> 00:04:10,490
Or maybe you're gonna get a
job for the cash to pay me back,

54
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:12,837
because you think I have years
to wait for some little punk

55
00:04:12,911 --> 00:04:15,900
to work his way through debt! You little shit stain!

56
00:04:21,568 --> 00:04:23,083
Mommy!

57
00:04:28,072 --> 00:04:31,518
Joseph and Avdol are in the
middle of doing battle with Mariah,

58
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:36,958
so I, Alessi, shall take on
the great honor of killing Jotaro and Polnareff.

59
00:04:37,083 --> 00:04:41,675
They're tenacious, to be sure, but I'll
do whatever it takes to achieve victory.

60
00:04:43,243 --> 00:04:44,929
Attaboy, Alessi.

61
00:04:48,101 --> 00:04:49,741
Enemy's name... Alessi.

62
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:53,751
Stand: Set, god of storms and chaos.

63
00:04:54,013 --> 00:04:56,328
Favorite phrase: "Attaboy."

64
00:05:08,488 --> 00:05:10,582
Polnareff, keep your guard up.

65
00:05:10,917 --> 00:05:13,050
Have you forgotten who you're talking to?

66
00:05:19,818 --> 00:05:20,434
Hmm.

67
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:24,044
Seems Mr. Joestar and Avdol already left,

68
00:05:24,137 --> 00:05:26,421
and it doesn't really look like there was a struggle.

69
00:05:30,156 --> 00:05:32,293
Old man, Avdol, you here?

70
00:05:34,661 --> 00:05:35,927
Hey, Jotaro,

71
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,343
I'm starting to get a bad feeling about this.

72
00:05:38,736 --> 00:05:39,656
Me, too.

73
00:05:50,997 --> 00:05:53,132
Ah, that looks yummy.

74
00:05:53,172 --> 00:05:54,811
Come on. Let me have a bite.

75
00:05:54,836 --> 00:05:57,097
All right. Just leave me some.

76
00:06:01,031 --> 00:06:02,581
Th-that dog took my sandwich!

77
00:06:02,715 --> 00:06:05,489
Hey, get back here this instant, you mangy flea bag!

78
00:06:29,235 --> 00:06:31,157
So you think I have nowhere to go?

79
00:06:31,414 --> 00:06:34,069
You boys truly haven't realized it yet, have you?

80
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:39,370
You only thought you were hunting me, when
really I was luring you here the entire time!

81
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:43,886
I'm afraid you're going to fry this time, Joestar!

82
00:06:44,983 --> 00:06:46,492
Magician's red!

83
00:06:49,775 --> 00:06:51,676
Hermit purple!

84
00:06:53,472 --> 00:06:59,678
Avdol might be able to defend himself for now
with his flames, but not you. Time to die, Joestar.

85
00:06:59,942 --> 00:07:05,309
The goddess bast is the perfect trap, and it's
also far more powerful than your hermit purple!

86
00:07:14,974 --> 00:07:15,533
Hmm?

87
00:07:30,402 --> 00:07:31,526
Hmm.

88
00:07:33,688 --> 00:07:35,455
Oh, dear, that's not good.

89
00:07:35,509 --> 00:07:37,046
I dropped my change.

90
00:07:37,632 --> 00:07:40,535
Now, where'd it go? Not over here.

91
00:07:40,669 --> 00:07:43,926
I'd lose my own head if it
wasn't attached to my shoulders.

92
00:07:44,139 --> 00:07:46,241
Hey, what do you think you're doing?

93
00:07:46,373 --> 00:07:48,321
I can tell you're following us.

94
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:54,732
I can already see the evil in
your eyes, so don't lie. Got it?

95
00:07:54,772 --> 00:07:56,245
Hmm? Hmm?

96
00:07:58,715 --> 00:08:01,784
I am so sorry, my good man. Were you talking to me?

97
00:08:01,837 --> 00:08:05,183
I'm not sure I understand what you meant by "evil eyes."

98
00:08:05,425 --> 00:08:09,401
My loving, non-evil parents gave me these baby blues. Eh?

99
00:08:10,752 --> 00:08:13,593
Well, what do you know? It's the change I was looking for.

100
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,224
Is that so?

101
00:08:15,814 --> 00:08:17,237
Then prove it!

102
00:08:17,271 --> 00:08:19,920
It'll be easy to prove that you're not a stand user,

103
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:21,595
unless you really are one.

104
00:08:22,749 --> 00:08:23,697
Connard!

105
00:08:31,155 --> 00:08:32,801
Merde, that was a close one.

106
00:08:33,827 --> 00:08:36,369
So I was right, and you are a stand user!

107
00:08:43,922 --> 00:08:45,008
He's running?

108
00:08:45,392 --> 00:08:49,157
Hey, Jotaro, it's the enemy! I'm hot on his trail!

109
00:08:49,182 --> 00:08:49,649
Hmm?

110
00:08:51,932 --> 00:08:52,821
Polnareff.

111
00:08:55,485 --> 00:08:57,414
Polnareff, where did you go?

112
00:08:57,496 --> 00:08:59,074
Over here, Jotaro!

113
00:09:05,485 --> 00:09:06,926
Come back here, damn you!

114
00:09:09,636 --> 00:09:10,583
Wait!

115
00:09:13,118 --> 00:09:14,093
What the hell?!

116
00:09:14,407 --> 00:09:15,506
This guy is quick!

117
00:09:15,862 --> 00:09:17,350
How can he be so fast?!

118
00:09:17,919 --> 00:09:19,831
Man, he's already so far ahead.

119
00:09:21,013 --> 00:09:22,431
Huh? That's strange.

120
00:09:22,635 --> 00:09:24,006
What happened to my voice?

121
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:31,219
Ow!

122
00:09:37,253 --> 00:09:39,665
W-What the heck is up with my shoes?

123
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:41,232
They're ginormous.

124
00:09:41,945 --> 00:09:43,925
Hey, watch where you're going.

125
00:09:44,198 --> 00:09:47,872
Don't you know running around in the
street like that can get you hurt or worse?

126
00:09:47,897 --> 00:09:50,896
You're lucky I wasn't the front
end of some out-of-control car.

127
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:52,183
Shut up, idiot!

128
00:09:52,272 --> 00:09:55,477
Why don't you go and lecture someone
else with that big mouth of yours?

129
00:09:55,508 --> 00:09:56,743
Now out of my way!

130
00:09:56,789 --> 00:09:58,621
I'm in the middle of chasing someone!

131
00:09:59,546 --> 00:10:01,411
Hey! What do you think you're doin'?!

132
00:10:01,467 --> 00:10:02,558
Let go of me!

133
00:10:02,751 --> 00:10:04,948
What? It's really high up here!

134
00:10:05,674 --> 00:10:07,523
He's lifting me up with one arm?

135
00:10:07,548 --> 00:10:09,279
Just how tall is this guy?!

136
00:10:09,322 --> 00:10:12,385
His face and hands are huge. It's like he's a giant!

137
00:10:12,461 --> 00:10:15,019
All right, listen here, you pint-sized pissant!

138
00:10:15,087 --> 00:10:19,130
I'm gonna teach you to go around shooting
your ignorant little mouth off to adults that way!

139
00:10:23,571 --> 00:10:27,547
You think you're a big man just because
you're playing dress-up in adult clothes?

140
00:10:27,607 --> 00:10:30,233
Annoying, good-for-nothing brat. Hmph.

141
00:10:30,483 --> 00:10:31,900
You bastard.

142
00:10:31,925 --> 00:10:33,868
Agh! Wh-what the hell?!

143
00:10:35,445 --> 00:10:36,310
Move it, kid!

144
00:10:36,343 --> 00:10:37,378
Get out of the way!

145
00:10:39,913 --> 00:10:42,976
W-wait a minute. What the hell is going on here?

146
00:10:43,215 --> 00:10:45,353
Why does everyone look like giants?!

147
00:10:49,741 --> 00:10:50,477
What?!

148
00:11:06,104 --> 00:11:07,850
W-W-What the...

149
00:11:08,268 --> 00:11:10,492
Why am I a kid?!

150
00:11:17,746 --> 00:11:19,192
Is this really me?!

151
00:11:19,258 --> 00:11:21,006
I've been turned into a kid!

152
00:11:21,427 --> 00:11:24,663
How is something like this happening to me?!

153
00:11:32,567 --> 00:11:36,169
C-could this really be happening to me?

154
00:11:36,622 --> 00:11:39,349
There's no possible way this kid could really be...

155
00:11:39,483 --> 00:11:40,821
Could really be me!

156
00:11:41,036 --> 00:11:42,933
Oh, my god, this kid is me!

157
00:11:43,261 --> 00:11:44,907
I turned into a little kid!

158
00:11:47,017 --> 00:11:49,994
No way! No way! No way! No way!

159
00:11:51,287 --> 00:11:53,388
It must be his stand's power.

160
00:11:53,435 --> 00:11:57,301
That creeper must have found a way to
put a curse on me during our fight earlier.

161
00:11:57,439 --> 00:12:01,315
I have a sneaking suspicion it happened
when his shadow stand lunged at me.

162
00:12:01,755 --> 00:12:03,850
How did I let him do this to me?!

163
00:12:03,898 --> 00:12:07,628
Shit, this is bad! This is
really bad! What am I gonna do?!

164
00:12:07,934 --> 00:12:08,479
Eh?

165
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:09,850
Jo...

166
00:12:09,875 --> 00:12:10,315
Hmm?

167
00:12:10,902 --> 00:12:13,437
Jo, uh...

168
00:12:15,731 --> 00:12:19,037
Uh, J-Jo...

169
00:12:19,153 --> 00:12:21,280
Uh, n-no, Jay!

170
00:12:21,359 --> 00:12:22,446
Jackie! J...

171
00:12:22,997 --> 00:12:24,380
Uh...

172
00:12:24,833 --> 00:12:26,492
W-What was his name?

173
00:12:26,843 --> 00:12:28,720
I can't remember his name!

174
00:12:28,894 --> 00:12:30,172
But I know this guy.

175
00:12:30,294 --> 00:12:31,440
He can help me!

176
00:12:31,833 --> 00:12:33,790
So why can't I remember it?

177
00:12:33,904 --> 00:12:35,977
Why can't I remember his name?!

178
00:12:36,010 --> 00:12:37,216
Hey, there, little boy,

179
00:12:37,771 --> 00:12:41,230
you, uh, didn't happen to see a
French guy come through here, did you?

180
00:12:41,644 --> 00:12:43,184
This guy is about yea tall,

181
00:12:43,610 --> 00:12:46,062
and he's got the exact same haircut as you do.

182
00:12:46,358 --> 00:12:48,962
Yeah, you're talking about me! It's me! It's me!

183
00:12:51,025 --> 00:12:52,172
Ah, good grief.

184
00:12:52,199 --> 00:12:54,235
Asking a kid was an awful idea.

185
00:12:54,757 --> 00:12:56,199
Huh? Uh.

186
00:12:56,545 --> 00:12:58,123
Hey! Hold on!

187
00:13:01,122 --> 00:13:04,661
I take it you've realized that your
body has been changed into a kid's.

188
00:13:04,699 --> 00:13:06,805
Both your mind and your body have regressed,

189
00:13:06,878 --> 00:13:10,588
and soon you'll lose all of the memories
that you've built up during adulthood.

190
00:13:11,808 --> 00:13:15,727
He can't seriously be able to
erase everything I knew as an adult.

191
00:13:17,566 --> 00:13:18,480
It's true.

192
00:13:18,686 --> 00:13:20,401
It's all becoming a blur.

193
00:13:23,031 --> 00:13:24,684
Guess it's about time, huh?

194
00:13:25,325 --> 00:13:27,237
I love picking on the weak.

195
00:13:27,262 --> 00:13:29,070
It's so amusing.

196
00:13:29,264 --> 00:13:31,572
Attaboy, Alessi. Attaboy.

197
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:35,197
Uh-uh!

198
00:13:35,557 --> 00:13:38,570
You're not getting away, you brat!

199
00:13:43,966 --> 00:13:45,836
I can't say this too loudly,

200
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:50,309
but picking on the weak really
gets me going, maybe too much.

201
00:13:52,090 --> 00:13:55,718
I may be a bit sick in the head,
but, hey, c'est la vie. Am I right?

202
00:13:56,004 --> 00:13:57,490
It's like everyone says,

203
00:13:57,557 --> 00:14:01,774
"if you think you're a little loony upstairs,
then there's a good chance you're probably not."

204
00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:04,585
It's my confirmation that I'm totally sane,

205
00:14:04,686 --> 00:14:08,719
and you can't imagine how good it feels
to know that I'll never lose to some kid.

206
00:14:09,697 --> 00:14:10,253
Mister!

207
00:14:10,278 --> 00:14:11,578
Whatever your name is, you have...

208
00:14:14,024 --> 00:14:14,652
Hmm?

209
00:14:20,087 --> 00:14:20,899
Hmph.

210
00:14:26,594 --> 00:14:28,271
As you no doubt know,

211
00:14:28,419 --> 00:14:33,039
my mission is to wipe you and your
good-for-nothing cohorts from the face of the planet.

212
00:14:33,847 --> 00:14:35,153
Unfortunately...

213
00:14:37,258 --> 00:14:39,618
I don't have time to savor the fun.

214
00:14:43,118 --> 00:14:43,657
Heh.

215
00:14:48,956 --> 00:14:49,418
Huh?

216
00:14:53,426 --> 00:14:55,074
What do we have here?

217
00:14:55,109 --> 00:14:56,976
Silver chariot, eh?

218
00:14:57,231 --> 00:14:59,214
I should have expected as much.

219
00:14:59,239 --> 00:15:01,908
Seems you were able to summon your stand as a kid.

220
00:15:02,424 --> 00:15:03,297
But...

221
00:15:03,417 --> 00:15:04,897
Huh?!

222
00:15:05,033 --> 00:15:07,219
Just how strong is this stupid stand user?!

223
00:15:07,244 --> 00:15:09,265
Even silver chariot is a kid!

224
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:11,707
Pami!

225
00:15:12,067 --> 00:15:12,687
Pami!

226
00:15:13,081 --> 00:15:15,108
And he's just as weak as I am.

227
00:15:15,270 --> 00:15:17,736
He bent his sword blocking those bullets!

228
00:15:18,103 --> 00:15:21,204
My stand, Set, reverted you back to your childhood state,

229
00:15:21,277 --> 00:15:24,879
which means that all of your mental
abilities were reverted right along with you.

230
00:15:25,167 --> 00:15:27,623
Your stand has gone back to a child's stand,

231
00:15:27,648 --> 00:15:30,962
the form it had before you two
were fully attuned to each other!

232
00:15:33,787 --> 00:15:35,164
Do you get it now?

233
00:15:37,012 --> 00:15:39,320
Good. It seems like you understand.

234
00:15:40,133 --> 00:15:41,447
Attaboy, kid.

235
00:15:47,402 --> 00:15:51,170
But, as weak as it is, your
stand is still at your disposal,

236
00:15:51,249 --> 00:15:54,352
so I shall use my stand for your execution.

237
00:15:58,663 --> 00:16:00,737
Time to die, Polnareff!

238
00:16:01,427 --> 00:16:02,974
You're mine!

239
00:16:03,377 --> 00:16:05,655
Oh, no!

240
00:16:06,819 --> 00:16:08,132
It broke in two!

241
00:16:11,138 --> 00:16:11,560
Eh?

242
00:16:16,487 --> 00:16:17,598
Hurts, doesn't it?!

243
00:16:17,658 --> 00:16:18,867
I meant to do that!

244
00:16:18,912 --> 00:16:22,241
Ow! Ow! It hurts!

245
00:16:35,428 --> 00:16:37,228
Little boy, are you all right?

246
00:16:37,772 --> 00:16:39,118
Uh...

247
00:16:39,471 --> 00:16:40,831
H-he's gone.

248
00:16:41,203 --> 00:16:45,279
So that guy runs for the hills as
soon as there's another adult around.

249
00:16:45,667 --> 00:16:49,400
I'm safe for now, but that freak was off his rocker.

250
00:16:51,501 --> 00:16:53,194
Don't run off, little boy.

251
00:16:53,435 --> 00:16:55,881
It looks like you're hurt. What happened?

252
00:16:56,450 --> 00:16:57,937
Huh? I, uh...

253
00:16:58,168 --> 00:17:00,141
Well, the thing is, you see...

254
00:17:00,201 --> 00:17:01,849
What are you mumbling about?

255
00:17:02,733 --> 00:17:04,501
Those wounds need to be treated.

256
00:17:04,526 --> 00:17:07,637
Why don't you come with me to my
house, and I'll fix you up, okay?

257
00:17:11,524 --> 00:17:12,517
Should I go?

258
00:17:12,684 --> 00:17:16,172
If I don't defeat the stand user,
I won't turn back into an adult.

259
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:20,662
If the past is any indication, he
won't attack me with this lady around.

260
00:17:20,795 --> 00:17:22,932
I can use that time to think of a plan.

261
00:17:23,931 --> 00:17:25,025
Come on. Hurry up.

262
00:17:25,050 --> 00:17:25,753
Whoa.

263
00:17:27,103 --> 00:17:28,802
Oh, that's right.

264
00:17:29,883 --> 00:17:30,332
Huh?

265
00:17:30,357 --> 00:17:32,140
You're hurt, so climb on my back,

266
00:17:32,187 --> 00:17:33,935
but make sure you hang on tight.

267
00:17:34,284 --> 00:17:34,801
Uh...

268
00:17:42,509 --> 00:17:44,177
She smells good.

269
00:17:48,327 --> 00:17:50,455
This hurts like a bitch!

270
00:17:51,601 --> 00:17:53,483
Damn that little crotch-sniffer!

271
00:17:53,628 --> 00:17:56,484
I'm not going to take this from a snot-nosed kid!

272
00:17:56,765 --> 00:17:58,385
He'll pay dearly for this.

273
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:00,510
I swear I'll butcher that brat!

274
00:18:15,609 --> 00:18:16,769
From the looks of things,

275
00:18:16,822 --> 00:18:18,753
he doesn't seem to be coming after me.

276
00:18:19,453 --> 00:18:23,720
All right, little boy. We're going to take a
bath, so let's take those clothes off, shall we?

277
00:18:23,745 --> 00:18:24,219
Huh?!

278
00:18:24,592 --> 00:18:26,491
You're completely covered in grime.

279
00:18:26,671 --> 00:18:29,382
I'll clean those wounds up and put some medicine on you.

280
00:18:43,911 --> 00:18:45,666
What are you staring at, sweetie?

281
00:18:45,965 --> 00:18:47,225
Take your clothes off.

282
00:18:47,596 --> 00:18:49,889
Better yet, I'll take them off for you.

283
00:18:50,055 --> 00:18:51,686
Here. Raise your leg.

284
00:18:52,066 --> 00:18:55,027
Hey, wait! What are you doing, lady?!

285
00:18:55,314 --> 00:18:56,591
But what's wrong?

286
00:18:57,478 --> 00:18:59,115
Uh, nothing at all.

287
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:02,996
No, it is something.

288
00:19:03,316 --> 00:19:05,302
It most definitely is something.

289
00:19:05,609 --> 00:19:10,514
I don't know why, but I get the feeling that
I should be really embarrassed about all this.

290
00:19:11,201 --> 00:19:14,408
Wait. Oh, no. What if my...

291
00:19:14,659 --> 00:19:17,464
Agh! It's so small!

292
00:19:17,663 --> 00:19:20,562
I don't know why, but for some reason, that makes me sad!

293
00:19:21,897 --> 00:19:23,144
Hey, don't cry.

294
00:19:23,477 --> 00:19:26,864
After we get all that dirt off of
you, you'll be as good as new again.

295
00:19:28,038 --> 00:19:29,332
Here. Lift your leg.

296
00:19:34,319 --> 00:19:38,014
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

297
00:19:38,221 --> 00:19:41,511
I-I-I'm so happy!

298
00:19:41,536 --> 00:19:44,757
Are you positive it's okay for me to touch you like this?!

299
00:19:44,817 --> 00:19:46,634
Of course it's okay, silly.

300
00:19:46,687 --> 00:19:49,467
If we don't clean up those
wounds... They could get infected.

301
00:19:49,704 --> 00:19:52,286
Oh, you've got dirt on your wee-wee, too.

302
00:19:56,038 --> 00:19:58,411
Oh, boy! I can't explain why,

303
00:19:58,471 --> 00:20:00,426
but I'm just so happy all of a sudden!

304
00:20:00,552 --> 00:20:02,554
I guess it's all part of being a kid.

305
00:20:10,627 --> 00:20:13,144
All right. You be a good boy, okay?

306
00:20:13,267 --> 00:20:14,418
Okay!

307
00:20:22,013 --> 00:20:23,928
The fool's delirious.

308
00:20:24,042 --> 00:20:26,180
Enjoy your stupor while you can,

309
00:20:26,214 --> 00:20:29,043
because I'm going to chop your face in two!

310
00:20:46,725 --> 00:20:49,503
What could you be grinning about, you silly boy?

311
00:20:49,770 --> 00:20:52,025
Now, I think it's time we wash your hair.

312
00:20:52,232 --> 00:20:55,012
Huh? No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

313
00:20:55,059 --> 00:20:57,046
I hate using shampoo!

314
00:20:58,192 --> 00:20:58,838
It gets into my eyes, and I hate it!

315
00:20:58,891 --> 00:21:00,482
Rock-paper-scissors...

316
00:21:00,507 --> 00:21:00,935
Scissors!

317
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:05,357
Monkey, monkey, monkey, monkey,
monkey, monkey, Monkey, monkey do!

318
00:21:05,693 --> 00:21:07,136
Monkey, monkey do!

319
00:21:08,089 --> 00:21:09,393
I lost!

320
00:21:10,911 --> 00:21:12,674
All right, sit still.

321
00:21:22,722 --> 00:21:24,262
Does it sting?

322
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,532
Yeah, it stings a lot.

323
00:21:27,086 --> 00:21:29,677
Can you wash your hair all by yourself?

324
00:21:29,703 --> 00:21:32,284
