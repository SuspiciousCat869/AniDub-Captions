1
00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:03,293
What is that?

2
00:00:04,306 --> 00:00:07,530
Weren't Avdol's flames
supposed to be able to sense anything?

3
00:00:07,892 --> 00:00:09,965
Avdol, where are you?!

4
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:11,580
Avdol...

5
00:00:12,286 --> 00:00:14,809
Has been reduced to nothingness.

6
00:00:15,532 --> 00:00:18,999
You were arrogant enough
to believe you could defeat lord Dio.

7
00:00:19,465 --> 00:00:22,888
Allow me to demonstrate just how wrong you were.

8
00:00:27,531 --> 00:00:29,997
You'll fall in line one by one

9
00:00:30,711 --> 00:00:34,870
as I scatter your atomic fragments
across the recesses of the void.

10
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:42,765
It can't be.

11
00:00:44,011 --> 00:00:45,320
I don't believe you.

12
00:00:45,812 --> 00:00:47,195
Avdol's not dead.

13
00:00:48,792 --> 00:00:51,551
Don't you lie to me!

14
00:00:53,295 --> 00:00:54,259
W-What?!

15
00:00:55,343 --> 00:00:59,764
I never would have imagined Polnareff's
stand could attack this swiftly from so far away.

16
00:00:59,946 --> 00:01:01,866
An amazing feat, to be sure.

17
00:01:02,452 --> 00:01:03,436
Over here.

18
00:01:03,576 --> 00:01:05,945
I want you to look at me when I kill you.

19
00:02:47,939 --> 00:02:48,566
Hmm?

20
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:49,926
All right,

21
00:02:50,184 --> 00:02:52,420
now I'm sure something fishy's going on.

22
00:02:52,471 --> 00:02:55,763
Ever since we escaped the mirage,
I've heard the sounds of a battle.

23
00:02:55,889 --> 00:02:58,563
Blast it. Avdol and Polnareff are out there.

24
00:02:58,746 --> 00:02:59,271
Hmm?

25
00:02:59,844 --> 00:03:00,875
Mm.

26
00:03:03,483 --> 00:03:07,478
Damn that guy. I know I hit the
bastard, but it wasn't enough to kill him.

27
00:03:07,744 --> 00:03:10,852
He just swallowed himself again
so he could hide in that abyss.

28
00:03:10,974 --> 00:03:12,671
Damn that guy and his stand.

29
00:03:20,963 --> 00:03:23,624
Avdol, how could you do that?

30
00:03:23,824 --> 00:03:26,721
How could you break the one rule you gave us?

31
00:03:26,906 --> 00:03:29,642
Polnareff, Iggy, you have to get out of here now!

32
00:03:30,542 --> 00:03:33,063
You told us we had to watch our own backs,

33
00:03:33,332 --> 00:03:36,174
that you wouldn't save us, even if we were in danger.

34
00:03:36,681 --> 00:03:38,033
You liar.

35
00:03:39,981 --> 00:03:45,272
You've been meddling in other people's business
ever since the moment we set foot in India.

36
00:03:45,872 --> 00:03:47,054
Damn it, Avdol!

37
00:03:47,079 --> 00:03:50,682
Why couldn't you just leave me alone
and mind your own freaking business?!

38
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:57,053
If I hadn't ducked, I'd be a dead man right now.

39
00:03:57,946 --> 00:04:00,375
It's like fate is telling me to carry on.

40
00:04:00,742 --> 00:04:03,705
This must be Avdol's way of knocking some sense into me.

41
00:04:18,293 --> 00:04:20,002
It's way too dangerous in here.

42
00:04:20,908 --> 00:04:21,919
Let's get moving!

43
00:04:31,927 --> 00:04:34,469
Come on, Iggy. We have to make it upstairs!

44
00:04:34,682 --> 00:04:35,849
Don't fall behind!

45
00:04:44,772 --> 00:04:45,619
Look up ahead!

46
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,899
It's the exit! We're almost there!

47
00:04:49,467 --> 00:04:52,512
But I won't just turn tail and run away.

48
00:04:53,832 --> 00:04:57,789
Avdol sacrificed himself for us, and
I'll repay that debt, no matter what!

49
00:04:58,031 --> 00:05:01,701
He believed we had the power to
put an end to Dio once and for all.

50
00:05:01,888 --> 00:05:04,567
I can't betray his faith in us by letting him down.

51
00:05:04,667 --> 00:05:06,100
That is not an option.

52
00:05:08,205 --> 00:05:11,880
I refuse to take the easy way out like some common coward.

53
00:05:12,301 --> 00:05:14,919
I'm gonna see this fight through to the bitter end!

54
00:05:15,125 --> 00:05:18,267
The only place I'm running to is Dio's shadow den!

55
00:05:25,866 --> 00:05:27,960
So up the stairs we go!

56
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:39,065
I expected him to dash out the door.

57
00:05:40,106 --> 00:05:40,680
Pity.

58
00:05:43,577 --> 00:05:46,232
Impressive. He managed a hit.

59
00:05:46,725 --> 00:05:51,311
It seems Polnareff's mental fortitude
gives him the ability to conquer his fears

60
00:05:51,336 --> 00:05:52,924
in the face of imminent death.

61
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:56,811
You will soon be joining Avdol. Rest assured.

62
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:01,535
Your strength pales in comparison to
the harbinger of death that is my stand.

63
00:06:03,324 --> 00:06:04,802
If what he says is true,

64
00:06:04,912 --> 00:06:08,032
his stand's jaws are the
gateway to an alternate dimension,

65
00:06:08,199 --> 00:06:10,238
a dark, unimaginable abyss,

66
00:06:10,419 --> 00:06:14,558
one that allows him to move through our
realm without leaving any trace of himself.

67
00:06:17,047 --> 00:06:18,585
But how does he do it?

68
00:06:19,871 --> 00:06:22,342
And how the heck am I supposed to beat him?

69
00:06:29,183 --> 00:06:31,528
No, no, no! He's cut us off!

70
00:06:33,401 --> 00:06:34,394
He's nearby.

71
00:06:34,914 --> 00:06:36,188
But where exactly?

72
00:06:36,474 --> 00:06:38,443
Iggy, I need you to watch my back,

73
00:06:39,977 --> 00:06:42,010
and don't worry. I'll do the same for you.

74
00:06:58,890 --> 00:07:03,307
Okay, if he wants to reach us, then he's
gonna have to come out of that other realm.

75
00:07:03,671 --> 00:07:07,543
This is good. He has to come out
from the dark beyond at some point.

76
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:11,615
When he does, I'll take my chance
and attack him with everything I've got.

77
00:07:12,148 --> 00:07:14,816
All right, come at me, you demented pinball!

78
00:07:14,876 --> 00:07:16,485
I'll slice you in two!

79
00:07:16,752 --> 00:07:19,386
Now I'm pissed off, so my chariot's even faster!

80
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,090
I may have lost Avdol,

81
00:07:21,328 --> 00:07:24,685
but it'll be a cold day in hell before I let you get away.

82
00:07:27,619 --> 00:07:28,166
Huh?

83
00:07:41,848 --> 00:07:42,249
Eh?

84
00:07:43,449 --> 00:07:44,358
What the hell?!

85
00:07:44,392 --> 00:07:46,468
He... he was hiding under my foot?

86
00:07:46,914 --> 00:07:47,926
Chario...

87
00:07:57,337 --> 00:07:58,628
Aah! My foot!

88
00:07:59,635 --> 00:08:01,099
Now you can't run away.

89
00:08:02,405 --> 00:08:05,413
I got your foot so that you can't hide anymore.

90
00:08:09,763 --> 00:08:10,916
Eat silver.

91
00:08:11,531 --> 00:08:12,549
I'll pass.

92
00:08:26,647 --> 00:08:28,717
Mr. Joestar, a brawl's under way.

93
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:30,330
Avdol and Polnareff.

94
00:08:30,377 --> 00:08:33,679
Sounds like they came in after us and
wound up getting themselves into a fight.

95
00:08:34,016 --> 00:08:36,784
Come on, you two! We have to find them ASAP!

96
00:08:42,759 --> 00:08:45,668
You've managed to hide amid the chaos, Polnareff.

97
00:08:47,123 --> 00:08:51,009
How futile. You couldn't have gone far with that injury,

98
00:08:51,205 --> 00:08:53,592
which means you're hiding beneath the rubble.

99
00:08:58,541 --> 00:09:01,608
By now, you must have realized
you're helpless against me.

100
00:09:01,868 --> 00:09:03,818
You shall meet your end by my hand.

101
00:09:05,458 --> 00:09:08,350
Now then, where could you be, Polnareff?

102
00:09:08,523 --> 00:09:11,208
That's quite the ruckus, Cool Ice.

103
00:09:16,699 --> 00:09:18,185
L-lord Dio.

104
00:09:20,429 --> 00:09:22,002
Please be careful, my lord.

105
00:09:22,115 --> 00:09:25,736
I believe Polnareff and that
four-legged rodent are still hiding nearby.

106
00:09:26,283 --> 00:09:28,198
Allow me to handle the situation.

107
00:09:28,383 --> 00:09:31,337
You mustn't trouble yourself with such nonsense, master.

108
00:09:44,388 --> 00:09:47,530
A fake Dio made from the fool. We got him.

109
00:09:48,916 --> 00:09:52,702
You'd think I'd feel guilty about
attacking from behind like a coward,

110
00:09:53,357 --> 00:09:54,597
and you'd be wrong,

111
00:09:54,689 --> 00:09:57,187
because you pulled the same shit on Avdol.

112
00:09:57,398 --> 00:09:59,422
This is the death you deserve.

113
00:09:59,594 --> 00:10:01,653
Now, Iggy! Crucify him.

114
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:13,972
Now Iggy! Crucify him!

115
00:10:14,013 --> 00:10:15,532
Make him pay for what he did.

116
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:18,616
End his life in the same merciless way he did Avdol's.

117
00:10:18,762 --> 00:10:20,647
Send him straight to hell!

118
00:10:26,797 --> 00:10:27,651
You're kidding?!

119
00:10:27,857 --> 00:10:29,806
He knows. But how?!

120
00:10:30,606 --> 00:10:34,283
Because the windows to my left are
letting in the light from the sun.

121
00:10:34,996 --> 00:10:37,981
Lord Dio would never enter this room during the day.

122
00:10:39,316 --> 00:10:41,876
You'll suffer a thousand deaths for your deception.

123
00:10:42,649 --> 00:10:43,410
Iggy.

124
00:10:53,457 --> 00:10:56,995
I made a vow to lord Dio that
I would kill you interlopers.

125
00:10:57,020 --> 00:10:58,773
He entrusted me with that honor.

126
00:10:59,027 --> 00:11:00,913
Lord Dio's a man of his word.

127
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:03,765
He would never descend to the second floor for any reason.

128
00:11:03,844 --> 00:11:05,931
No. He's gonna kill Iggy.

129
00:11:06,199 --> 00:11:08,486
He's about to be swallowed by the abyss!

130
00:11:09,135 --> 00:11:11,488
Now die, you filthy, pathetic dog.

131
00:11:12,445 --> 00:11:16,282
Your incorrigible ruse forced
me to destroy lord Dio's likeness!

132
00:11:24,263 --> 00:11:26,376
D-did he really just hit him?

133
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:28,418
He didn't use the void.

134
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:31,222
Instead of killing Iggy, he went in for a punch!

135
00:11:33,696 --> 00:11:35,353
Do you know what you've done?

136
00:11:36,228 --> 00:11:37,968
I don't care if it was a fake.

137
00:11:38,037 --> 00:11:41,196
You forced me to destroy a figure in the form of lord Dio,

138
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:43,585
and you must answer for that crime.

139
00:11:45,143 --> 00:11:46,755
Your life is mine now!

140
00:11:46,932 --> 00:11:48,570
I will kick you to death!

141
00:11:52,506 --> 00:11:55,310
My dark abyss could swallow you whole in an instant,

142
00:11:55,428 --> 00:11:57,967
but a quick death wouldn't satiate my fury.

143
00:11:59,267 --> 00:12:00,240
This whole mess,

144
00:12:00,302 --> 00:12:01,635
it's all your fault!

145
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:04,465
This is what happens to those who anger me.

146
00:12:04,596 --> 00:12:06,293
Have you learned your lesson yet?!

147
00:12:06,873 --> 00:12:08,895
How 'bout it? Is this better?

148
00:12:09,028 --> 00:12:12,372
Tell me! Is it? Is it?! Is it?!

149
00:12:13,628 --> 00:12:15,437
Stop it! Leave him alone!

150
00:12:16,041 --> 00:12:18,265
It's like Cool Ice's brain has melted.

151
00:12:18,737 --> 00:12:23,010
Is he really going bat-shit because he
destroyed some pile of sand that looked like Dio?

152
00:12:24,070 --> 00:12:26,772
From over here, his soul is the murky abyss.

153
00:12:26,898 --> 00:12:31,313
It's a bottomless black hole that obliterates
any and every thing that gets in its way.

154
00:12:34,122 --> 00:12:35,916
I was warned about the humans.

155
00:12:35,981 --> 00:12:39,921
Lord Dio said the resolve in their
hearts must never be underestimated.

156
00:12:40,561 --> 00:12:43,447
But you, you're just a flea-bitten stray.

157
00:12:43,536 --> 00:12:45,035
You've never known resolve,

158
00:12:45,078 --> 00:12:47,357
and you certainly know nothing of pride.

159
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,386
Yeah? Grin at this!

160
00:12:53,566 --> 00:12:54,914
Leave him alone.

161
00:12:54,939 --> 00:12:56,825
You like that? Do you?!

162
00:12:57,358 --> 00:12:58,462
What did I say?

163
00:12:58,508 --> 00:13:00,879
Come on! Your suffering's just begun.

164
00:13:00,915 --> 00:13:03,833
Cool Ice! You're dealing with me now!

165
00:13:08,134 --> 00:13:10,430
I'm ending this, Polnareff.

166
00:13:17,776 --> 00:13:18,450
Damn it.

167
00:13:20,247 --> 00:13:21,220
He's gone!

168
00:13:21,454 --> 00:13:23,770
But more importantly, Iggy,

169
00:13:24,089 --> 00:13:26,572
our plan to trick Cool Ice may have fallen through,

170
00:13:26,679 --> 00:13:28,907
but your sand might have just saved us.

171
00:13:28,934 --> 00:13:31,990
Thanks to you, I think I found a way to find the bastard.

172
00:13:42,388 --> 00:13:43,752
Yeah, that's him, all right.

173
00:13:43,916 --> 00:13:45,696
I can see him moving around.

174
00:13:46,103 --> 00:13:48,702
Guess your stand power is a double-edged sword.

175
00:13:49,248 --> 00:13:53,885
When you move, your stand has no choice
but to absorb everything in your path.

176
00:13:54,332 --> 00:13:58,179
So choke on a mouthful of this,
and get over here, you piece of shit.

177
00:13:58,612 --> 00:14:02,820
As soon as you come out from behind
your stand's putrid teeth to attack me,

178
00:14:03,646 --> 00:14:06,266
I'll turn the tables and finish you off.

179
00:14:07,392 --> 00:14:10,104
Bull's-eye! Yeah, eat that!

180
00:14:10,823 --> 00:14:14,239
Well, would you look at that?
I found your weakness, Cool Ice.

181
00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:17,504
Any attempt to pinpoint my location leaves you vulnerable,

182
00:14:17,644 --> 00:14:22,885
which is probably a tad inconvenient, since you
can't see me without emerging from your dark dimension.

183
00:14:24,109 --> 00:14:25,302
It's over.

184
00:14:25,629 --> 00:14:28,815
Now suck on my sword and burn in hell, fils de pute!

185
00:14:28,995 --> 00:14:30,901
Hurry up, and die.

186
00:14:39,644 --> 00:14:42,022
W-What? How are you still alive?

187
00:14:42,295 --> 00:14:44,794
I skewered your throat and brainstem.

188
00:14:45,003 --> 00:14:46,607
Would you die, already?!

189
00:14:46,792 --> 00:14:48,573
No way you're getting out of it.

190
00:14:48,744 --> 00:14:50,990
Hurry up, and die!

191
00:14:53,246 --> 00:14:57,045
Stop making me repeat myself. Die!

192
00:15:00,379 --> 00:15:01,787
I cannot die.

193
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:04,842
My mission is far too important to feel any pain.

194
00:15:04,950 --> 00:15:07,205
I will not rest until I kill you.

195
00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:11,157
I'll swallow Iggy, the Joestars,
and anyone else who gets in my way.

196
00:15:11,236 --> 00:15:14,226
Only after your deaths will I allow myself to die.

197
00:15:21,459 --> 00:15:22,465
Bastard!

198
00:15:22,701 --> 00:15:23,898
There's a good boy.

199
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:25,573
You knew to withdraw your sword.

200
00:15:25,792 --> 00:15:28,226
I also know that you're about to die.

201
00:15:31,804 --> 00:15:32,991
This is the one,

202
00:15:33,078 --> 00:15:35,346
the vile arm you used to stab me.

203
00:15:41,887 --> 00:15:43,078
Knock it off!

204
00:15:44,170 --> 00:15:44,972
Damn it!

205
00:15:45,158 --> 00:15:47,496
I had no choice but to shove him away.

206
00:15:47,953 --> 00:15:48,766
No!

207
00:15:49,634 --> 00:15:51,492
Y-you're not going anywhere!

208
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:56,406
Did I get him? Ah, where'd he go now?

209
00:15:59,298 --> 00:16:02,673
Shit. He got my leg. I can't move.

210
00:16:03,222 --> 00:16:05,555
But I can't think about the pain right now.

211
00:16:05,732 --> 00:16:07,023
I was so close.

212
00:16:07,093 --> 00:16:09,587
I almost managed to land a killing blow,

213
00:16:09,770 --> 00:16:11,222
but he got away.

214
00:16:11,675 --> 00:16:15,019
This guy is different, fueled by pure vengeance.

215
00:16:15,147 --> 00:16:16,532
And he's not just nuts.

216
00:16:16,798 --> 00:16:19,295
His devotion to Dio is all-consuming.

217
00:16:19,488 --> 00:16:21,779
But I won't let him get the upper hand.

218
00:16:21,955 --> 00:16:23,632
You said you couldn't die yet?

219
00:16:23,769 --> 00:16:26,127
Well, I can't die until I kill you!

220
00:16:28,033 --> 00:16:29,759
Okay, here he comes.

221
00:16:30,056 --> 00:16:31,165
Take this!

222
00:16:33,079 --> 00:16:34,384
Shit, it's no use.

223
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:37,174
His stand just obliterated the tip of my sword,

224
00:16:37,202 --> 00:16:39,950
though it probably wouldn't
matter, even if it were intact.

225
00:16:39,993 --> 00:16:42,821
It's impossible to attack him
when he's hidden in the abyss.

226
00:16:42,852 --> 00:16:45,506
If I so much as touch that thing, it'll swallow me whole.

227
00:16:49,372 --> 00:16:52,969
Great, now he's absorbing the building at random. Merde!

228
00:16:55,794 --> 00:16:59,491
That's clever. He knows full well
I'll go after him if he shows himself,

229
00:16:59,516 --> 00:17:02,275
so he's blindly attacking to
prevent me from fighting back.

230
00:17:03,394 --> 00:17:04,923
He's not messing around.

231
00:17:04,976 --> 00:17:07,178
At this rate, he's gonna hit me for sure.

232
00:17:07,299 --> 00:17:09,621
I should pull back chariot and think of a plan.

233
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,975
Damn. This isn't good.

234
00:17:18,284 --> 00:17:21,067
Iggy's not gonna last long if he keeps losing blood.

235
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:25,159
From the state he's in, I'd say his
broken ribs must have punctured his lungs.

236
00:17:33,392 --> 00:17:35,678
And just when I thought this couldn't get any worse.

237
00:17:35,735 --> 00:17:37,862
Why the hell is he devouring the walls?

238
00:17:41,743 --> 00:17:44,360
Wait a second. I'm starting to think I was all wrong.

239
00:17:44,537 --> 00:17:45,786
This isn't random.

240
00:17:45,945 --> 00:17:48,203
It was all part of his plan from the beginning.

241
00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:51,029
He's been drawing circles around me,

242
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:54,003
and with every lap, he's getting closer and closer.

243
00:17:55,631 --> 00:17:57,291
The odds are stacked against me,

244
00:17:57,531 --> 00:17:58,813
but I have to do something.

245
00:17:58,951 --> 00:18:00,252
He's closing in.

246
00:18:00,946 --> 00:18:02,900
He still doesn't know our location,

247
00:18:03,015 --> 00:18:06,470
but with that rolling ball of death
hurtling toward us, it doesn't matter.

248
00:18:07,118 --> 00:18:09,131
He's got us right where he wants us.

249
00:18:09,622 --> 00:18:13,773
There's no way I'm gonna be able to
dodge an attack from him with this bum leg.

250
00:18:15,241 --> 00:18:18,038
I-I've got to try to escape through the floor.

251
00:18:21,539 --> 00:18:23,726
I don't have enough time to tunnel through!

252
00:18:24,107 --> 00:18:25,833
He's coming straight for us!

253
00:18:29,929 --> 00:18:31,443
Somehow, I dodged it.

254
00:18:31,862 --> 00:18:36,426
Not out of the woods. He's closing in on
me like a needle on an old record player.

255
00:18:36,502 --> 00:18:41,353
I only have about five more rounds before he
makes his way back here and finishes me off for good.

256
00:18:42,082 --> 00:18:44,579
So, the million-dollar question

257
00:18:44,745 --> 00:18:46,820
is how do I dodge with this injured leg?

258
00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:02,302
If I had it my way, I'd just pick option two,

259
00:19:02,374 --> 00:19:03,966
but I can't count on that.

260
00:19:03,991 --> 00:19:06,727
They only entered the mansion 10 minutes before us.

261
00:19:06,752 --> 00:19:11,992
As much as I'd love for them to swoop in out of thin
air and save the day like some American comic book hero,

262
00:19:12,227 --> 00:19:14,535
wishful thinking's not gonna save me now.

263
00:19:14,793 --> 00:19:17,679
There's no point hoping for an out-of-the-blue rescue.

264
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:21,577
For all I know, the others might be
in the middle of a fight themselves.

265
00:19:23,089 --> 00:19:24,063
All right then.

266
00:19:24,364 --> 00:19:26,320
Option one's our only choice.

267
00:19:30,215 --> 00:19:34,187
Okay, chariot, I need you to pull me
out of the circle as fast as you can.

268
00:19:40,055 --> 00:19:41,118
What are you doing?

269
00:19:41,388 --> 00:19:43,067
Pull me faster, chariot!

270
00:19:48,658 --> 00:19:50,431
I-it's no use.

271
00:19:52,365 --> 00:19:53,146
What do you know?

272
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:55,660
The answer ended up being option three.

273
00:19:56,269 --> 00:19:57,727
Life's a bitch.

274
00:20:00,133 --> 00:20:03,925
Silver chariot is a finesse-orientated
stand that fights with a saber.

275
00:20:04,344 --> 00:20:07,305
It simply doesn't have the power to pull my body weight,

276
00:20:07,330 --> 00:20:08,805
especially when I'm injured.

277
00:20:09,838 --> 00:20:11,053
I'm done for.

278
00:20:26,107 --> 00:20:29,504
You're holding on by a thread.
Stay down, you stupid mutt.

279
00:20:29,817 --> 00:20:32,565
If you keep moving or try using your stand's power,

280
00:20:32,792 --> 00:20:35,926
your broken ribs will sink
deeper into your lungs and kill you.

281
00:20:41,913 --> 00:20:44,482
Hey, you can drop the tough guy act, you idiot.

282
00:20:44,544 --> 00:20:47,938
The only thing this will accomplish
is you dying right along with me.

283
00:20:53,132 --> 00:20:55,980
Just you wait. I'm the one who's gonna save you.

284
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:59,933
You have to live on to tell Mr. Joestar
and the others about this bastard.

285
00:21:00,419 --> 00:21:02,507
You have to defeat him in my stead.

286
00:21:02,893 --> 00:21:06,537
Avdol might have saved me,
but you sure as hell better not!

287
00:21:06,704 --> 00:21:09,248
If we all die here, then what was the point of this?

288
00:21:12,852 --> 00:21:15,503
One more loop, and its lights out.

289
00:21:16,094 --> 00:21:17,627
So it's number three.

290
00:21:18,227 --> 00:21:20,262
Life can be a bitch sometimes.

291
00:21:21,598 --> 00:21:23,090
We both wanted to win.

292
00:21:23,729 --> 00:21:25,378
Guess he wanted it more.

293
00:21:29,890 --> 00:21:32,365
Au revoir, Iggy.
