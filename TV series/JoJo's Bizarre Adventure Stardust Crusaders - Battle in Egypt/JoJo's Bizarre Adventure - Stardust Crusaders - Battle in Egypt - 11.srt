1
00:00:01,187 --> 00:00:02,752
Before we get things started,

2
00:00:03,043 --> 00:00:04,573
there's something I wanna check.

3
00:00:05,137 --> 00:00:07,568
How about you go ahead and shuffle those cards?

4
00:00:19,987 --> 00:00:21,946
And shuffled, they are.

5
00:00:22,368 --> 00:00:24,830
What, pray tell, do you have in mind next?

6
00:00:25,358 --> 00:00:27,178
Now draw a card from the deck.

7
00:00:27,811 --> 00:00:30,759
Which one it is doesn't really
make a whole lot of difference,

8
00:00:31,178 --> 00:00:32,947
but don't show anyone.

9
00:00:35,582 --> 00:00:36,500
Very well.

10
00:00:37,199 --> 00:00:38,639
And now I'll call it.

11
00:00:38,739 --> 00:00:40,136
It's the six of hearts.

12
00:00:40,642 --> 00:00:43,062
Next, I think I'll name the cards from the top down.

13
00:00:43,134 --> 00:00:45,207
Five of spades, queen of diamonds,

14
00:00:45,232 --> 00:00:47,167
Jack of spades, ace of hearts,

15
00:00:47,233 --> 00:00:49,594
seven of diamonds, plus the six of clubs,

16
00:00:49,619 --> 00:00:51,679
king of clubs, and two of diamonds.

17
00:00:54,505 --> 00:00:55,772
He guessed them all!

18
00:00:56,135 --> 00:00:58,424
And that's after D'arby shuffled the deck!

19
00:00:58,449 --> 00:00:59,951
How did you do that?!

20
00:01:00,126 --> 00:01:02,885
I could rattle off the entire deck if I wanted to.

21
00:01:03,863 --> 00:01:05,504
Remember my request from earlier?

22
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:10,161
While you were shuffling the cards, Star
Platinum was busy memorizing their order in the deck.

23
00:01:11,225 --> 00:01:13,169
Quite the interesting strategy.

24
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:15,127
That said, defeating your plan

25
00:01:15,174 --> 00:01:19,198
is a simple matter of shuffling the cards in
a manner that obstructs your vision of them.

26
00:01:19,722 --> 00:01:21,075
Are you that dense?

27
00:01:21,261 --> 00:01:25,330
Cheating is gonna be damn near impossible
as long as you have me as an opponent.

28
00:01:25,865 --> 00:01:27,871
Just somethin' I thought you should be aware of.

29
00:01:29,182 --> 00:01:30,042
Okay.

30
00:01:42,702 --> 00:01:44,068
The security seal.

31
00:01:44,301 --> 00:01:49,758
An unbroken seal is an irrefutable confirmation
that the deck has not been tampered with in any way.

32
00:02:00,808 --> 00:02:02,529
Well, there's only one joker here.

33
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:04,176
Don't see anything unusual.

34
00:02:05,137 --> 00:02:06,404
It's a normal deck.

35
00:02:10,802 --> 00:02:12,877
The page number is 538.

36
00:02:13,231 --> 00:02:16,463
540. No, page 556.

37
00:02:18,585 --> 00:02:19,891
I've still got it.

38
00:02:20,247 --> 00:02:24,514
My ability to discern page
numbers by touch is as sharp as ever.

39
00:02:24,917 --> 00:02:29,310
It's true that Jotaro's Star
Platinum has incredible visual prowess,

40
00:02:29,576 --> 00:02:33,556
but I can remember the placement of
anything simply through the use of touch.

41
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:38,572
Shuffle them all you want. I still
know the exact location of every card.

42
00:02:45,646 --> 00:02:48,105
Okay, open the game.

43
00:02:51,104 --> 00:02:53,004
Looks like it's the ten of hearts.

44
00:02:53,186 --> 00:02:54,852
I drew the seven of cubs.

45
00:02:55,121 --> 00:02:57,122
Then it seems like I'll be dealing.

46
00:02:58,161 --> 00:02:58,821
All right.

47
00:02:59,071 --> 00:03:02,137
I need to shuffle so Star Platinum can't see.

48
00:03:08,454 --> 00:03:10,189
If you would cut the deck...

49
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:25,622
Thank you, and now I'll deal.

50
00:03:26,586 --> 00:03:29,071
One for Jotaro. One for me.

51
00:03:29,249 --> 00:03:31,627
One for Jotaro. One for me.

52
00:03:37,114 --> 00:03:40,162
Huh? I-I don't understand!

53
00:03:40,233 --> 00:03:41,276
What happened?!

54
00:03:42,014 --> 00:03:43,597
Jotaro, his finger!

55
00:03:43,737 --> 00:03:47,301
Why the devil would you use Star
Platinum to break D'arby's finger?

56
00:03:47,607 --> 00:03:48,560
Like I said,

57
00:03:48,936 --> 00:03:51,428
you're not gonna cheat while you're playing against me.

58
00:03:51,511 --> 00:03:53,272
Huh? He tried to cheat?

59
00:03:53,427 --> 00:03:55,772
But he was only dealing the cards, wasn't he?

60
00:03:55,949 --> 00:03:58,307
I didn't notice him do anything suspicious.

61
00:03:58,778 --> 00:04:02,710
That's what he wanted us to think, but
take a good look at the cards in his left hand.

62
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,207
Ahh! I see now!

63
00:04:05,232 --> 00:04:07,184
The second card is sticking out.

64
00:04:08,084 --> 00:04:09,843
That's the card he tried to deal me.

65
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:13,176
The entire time, he was pretending to deal the top card,

66
00:04:13,311 --> 00:04:16,312
but the truth is he was dealing
me the second card from the top.

67
00:04:17,534 --> 00:04:18,779
That being the case,

68
00:04:18,853 --> 00:04:20,979
it means the top card would have gone to him.

69
00:04:21,972 --> 00:04:23,646
If he'd gotten his hands on it,

70
00:04:23,765 --> 00:04:26,485
the cheating bastard would have had a total of three tens.

71
00:04:26,858 --> 00:04:29,582
This maneuver is known as the second deal,

72
00:04:30,292 --> 00:04:32,098
a devious sleight-of-hand technique

73
00:04:32,138 --> 00:04:35,045
involving the dealer throwing out
the second card in the deck,

74
00:04:35,138 --> 00:04:38,148
instead of dealing the top card as one would expect.

75
00:04:39,296 --> 00:04:41,731
When the technique is executed by a professional,

76
00:04:41,883 --> 00:04:44,735
the cheat is almost undetectable to the naked eye.

77
00:04:45,535 --> 00:04:46,755
And if that wasn't enough,

78
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:50,633
D'arby can discern the location
of every card in the deck by touch.

79
00:04:51,113 --> 00:04:55,381
You brutish imbecile! How dare you break my finger?

80
00:04:57,484 --> 00:04:59,456
I was playing nice with that attack.

81
00:04:59,481 --> 00:05:02,139
You should count yourself lucky I didn't rip it off.

82
00:05:03,146 --> 00:05:04,589
Ah, good grief.

83
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:06,944
I guess I can't let you cut the deck anymore.

84
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:10,581
Someone else is gonna do it from now on.

85
00:05:11,601 --> 00:05:13,611
That boy on the hill looks up to the job.

86
00:05:15,663 --> 00:05:17,001
Have it your way.

87
00:05:17,388 --> 00:05:19,309
Hey, Avdol, ask him over.

88
00:05:19,395 --> 00:05:20,226
Right away.

89
00:05:21,044 --> 00:05:22,232
Most impressive.

90
00:05:22,256 --> 00:05:22,851
Hmm?

91
00:05:23,119 --> 00:05:26,307
Successful cheating requires the element of surprise,

92
00:05:26,507 --> 00:05:29,542
and it takes more than sharp eyes to prevent that.

93
00:05:29,632 --> 00:05:33,482
It appears I underestimated you,
as you saw through my second deal.

94
00:05:34,002 --> 00:05:37,231
I'll accept my fractured finger as proper punishment.

95
00:05:37,597 --> 00:05:43,418
But from here on, I'll devote my full
concentration to winning the game, Jotaro.

96
00:05:44,365 --> 00:05:49,317
I've not done so since my
colossal gamble on may 17, 1986.

97
00:05:49,342 --> 00:05:53,266
I was playing against a Japanese
man known as Shozo Mayama.

98
00:05:53,318 --> 00:05:57,932
As the Victor, my spoils included
his eight Tokyo properties and his soul.

99
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:00,051
I will say this for Mayama.

100
00:06:00,274 --> 00:06:02,569
Wealth didn't dull his gambler's instincts.

101
00:06:05,267 --> 00:06:08,733
It's only fair that I warn you
I'm not here on behalf of lord Dio!

102
00:06:08,846 --> 00:06:11,936
I am here due to the simple fact that I am a born gambler!

103
00:06:13,428 --> 00:06:15,008
W-What do you think you're doing?

104
00:06:15,119 --> 00:06:17,647
Those souls are Mr. Joestar's and Polnareff's!

105
00:06:28,144 --> 00:06:31,754
I've done nothing more than split
their souls into six chips each.

106
00:06:31,801 --> 00:06:34,040
I'm sure you know this, but in poker,

107
00:06:34,102 --> 00:06:37,899
if you're on the verge of losing,
it's perfectly acceptable to fold.

108
00:06:38,574 --> 00:06:41,549
However, if you use up all the chips for the ante,

109
00:06:41,574 --> 00:06:44,227
there's no way to bet, and the game doesn't work.

110
00:06:44,269 --> 00:06:49,996
To put it plainly, winning back six chips is the
equivalent of winning the soul of one of your friends.

111
00:06:50,142 --> 00:06:51,209
Make sense?

112
00:06:52,299 --> 00:06:53,983
All right then, Jotaro.

113
00:06:54,202 --> 00:06:58,108
If you still want to play, you'll have
the opportunity to win back the chips,

114
00:06:58,289 --> 00:07:01,294
but before that, I need to hear you say the words.

115
00:07:04,553 --> 00:07:05,495
With pleasure.

116
00:07:05,762 --> 00:07:07,835
I'll bet my soul on the game's outcome.

117
00:07:08,205 --> 00:07:09,121
Okay.

118
00:07:09,573 --> 00:07:10,480
Jotaro!

119
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:17,936
The pure white chips in front of you
are a physical representation of your soul.

120
00:07:18,603 --> 00:07:21,186
Once I've procured all six of those chips,

121
00:07:21,431 --> 00:07:23,973
your soul will be added to my collection.

122
00:07:44,175 --> 00:07:47,842
For my opening action, I shall
bet one chip of Polnareff's soul.

123
00:07:50,358 --> 00:07:51,511
Let's begin.

124
00:07:52,043 --> 00:07:56,676
When beginning a new game of poker,
each player is dealt a total of five cards.

125
00:07:56,883 --> 00:07:59,937
Players can improve their hand by swapping out cards.

126
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:05,064
Though it seems straightforward on the surface,

127
00:08:05,144 --> 00:08:09,566
it's the betting aspect that makes poker
a game of determination and psychology.

128
00:08:11,169 --> 00:08:12,891
Now then, what to do?

129
00:08:13,244 --> 00:08:14,762
Ah, I think I'll raise.

130
00:08:17,023 --> 00:08:22,144
Jotaro, you should bear in mind that
those six chips beside you are your soul.

131
00:08:22,374 --> 00:08:25,523
Make sure you think carefully before making a move.

132
00:08:25,548 --> 00:08:26,182
Eh?

133
00:08:26,667 --> 00:08:27,391
Listen.

134
00:08:27,457 --> 00:08:29,831
It's okay if you don't understand what's going on.

135
00:08:29,995 --> 00:08:31,263
Don't worry yourself.

136
00:08:31,436 --> 00:08:34,807
You just focus your attention on
cutting and dealing the cards, all right?

137
00:08:34,879 --> 00:08:35,944
Uh, mm.

138
00:08:36,363 --> 00:08:37,901
Give me three cards.

139
00:08:45,566 --> 00:08:48,472
Would you look at that? Such a serious glare.

140
00:08:48,606 --> 00:08:51,472
Behind it must be an outstanding hand.

141
00:08:51,958 --> 00:08:55,624
I suppose I'll play it safe for
now and bet one more Polnareff.

142
00:08:55,810 --> 00:08:56,878
Call, one.

143
00:08:57,289 --> 00:09:00,768
If you don't fold, you'll need three
chips per game, at the very least.

144
00:09:01,793 --> 00:09:04,767
All right, bring it on, Jotaro.

145
00:09:07,392 --> 00:09:09,465
Two pair, with eights and nines.

146
00:09:09,906 --> 00:09:10,643
Hmm.

147
00:09:10,822 --> 00:09:12,111
That's too bad.

148
00:09:12,449 --> 00:09:14,814
Two pair, Jacks and queens.

149
00:09:17,022 --> 00:09:17,757
Oh, no!

150
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:19,435
My, that was a close one.

151
00:09:19,565 --> 00:09:21,883
I was on the verge of a crushing defeat.

152
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,887
But as it stands...

153
00:09:35,678 --> 00:09:37,658
H-he only has three left.

154
00:09:37,971 --> 00:09:39,210
Jotaro, what are you...

155
00:09:40,674 --> 00:09:43,123
Okay, next game. Deal the cards.

156
00:09:51,508 --> 00:09:53,645
You should be careful what you wish for.

157
00:09:53,892 --> 00:09:56,370
The next game may well be your last.

158
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:03,698
I'll change one card.

159
00:10:04,282 --> 00:10:04,849
Huh?

160
00:10:14,046 --> 00:10:14,580
Huh?

161
00:10:16,815 --> 00:10:18,834
What's the problem, Jotaro?

162
00:10:19,041 --> 00:10:23,730
Hurry up, and check your hand so you can make
a decision as to whether you'll change or fold.

163
00:10:23,868 --> 00:10:25,136
Hey, Jotaro?

164
00:10:27,412 --> 00:10:28,479
No, it's fine.

165
00:10:29,789 --> 00:10:30,997
These cards will do.

166
00:10:31,369 --> 00:10:31,911
Wha?!

167
00:10:31,936 --> 00:10:32,343
Eh?

168
00:10:33,372 --> 00:10:35,307
So sorry. Come again?

169
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:37,150
There must be some confusion.

170
00:10:37,290 --> 00:10:38,763
Perhaps I misheard you.

171
00:10:38,796 --> 00:10:41,655
I could have sworn I heard you say, "these cards will do."

172
00:10:41,786 --> 00:10:44,573
No, you heard right. I'm fine with these cards.

173
00:10:44,803 --> 00:10:46,592
I'll play the round with this hand.

174
00:10:47,361 --> 00:10:48,327
Obviously!

175
00:10:48,427 --> 00:10:53,493
What I'm trying to ask is do you intend to play
those cards without so much as glancing at them?!

176
00:10:54,524 --> 00:10:55,671
These cards will do.

177
00:10:56,567 --> 00:10:58,307
Enough subterfuge!

178
00:10:58,331 --> 00:10:59,066
Answer me!

179
00:10:59,126 --> 00:11:03,509
How can you play a round with any sort of confidence
if you don't even look at the cards in your hand?!

180
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:04,497
Need a favor.

181
00:11:05,011 --> 00:11:05,580
You in?

182
00:11:06,546 --> 00:11:07,277
Favor?

183
00:11:07,566 --> 00:11:09,814
Of course, but answer something first.

184
00:11:09,847 --> 00:11:12,304
Why are you hellbent on not looking at your cards?

185
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:15,174
Damn it, Jotaro! I demand that you answer me!

186
00:11:15,290 --> 00:11:17,625
Let's see now. Raise you another two.

187
00:11:21,708 --> 00:11:24,061
And while I'm at it, I'll throw in Avdol's soul.

188
00:11:24,249 --> 00:11:26,663
Argh! What?!

189
00:11:29,817 --> 00:11:32,779
I admit you're an impressive opponent, D'arby.

190
00:11:32,899 --> 00:11:35,402
Sure, you're no match for our stands physically,

191
00:11:35,706 --> 00:11:38,883
but under pressure, you can
be amazingly calm and clever.

192
00:11:38,950 --> 00:11:42,036
Suffice it to say, I'm not
much in terms of being a gambler.

193
00:11:42,068 --> 00:11:44,402
It'd be easy for you to read me like a book,

194
00:11:45,103 --> 00:11:47,168
so I could never defeat someone like you,

195
00:11:47,667 --> 00:11:50,282
but I have the utmost confidence in Jotaro.

196
00:11:50,593 --> 00:11:52,739
I don't know why he won't look at his cards,

197
00:11:52,770 --> 00:11:54,308
but that's none of my concern.

198
00:11:54,916 --> 00:11:58,584
If he asks for my soul, I won't
hesitate to put my life on the line.

199
00:11:58,778 --> 00:12:01,561
My soul is in Jotaro's more than capable hands.

200
00:12:02,354 --> 00:12:04,558
So that's how we're playing this.

201
00:12:07,466 --> 00:12:12,236
It's become apparent that the two of you have
succumbed to the pressure of our little game.

202
00:12:12,584 --> 00:12:15,206
You there, I believe you owe me another card.

203
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:16,439
Hurry, and deal me.

204
00:12:16,568 --> 00:12:17,828
Y-yes, sir.

205
00:12:23,268 --> 00:12:23,714
Hmm.

206
00:12:25,897 --> 00:12:28,702
I dealt just as you asked, master D'arby.

207
00:12:29,448 --> 00:12:32,319
His hand is worthless. There's no doubt about it.

208
00:12:32,618 --> 00:12:35,051
My skills as a dealer never fail.

209
00:12:35,858 --> 00:12:38,319
You've won. I know you have.

210
00:12:39,066 --> 00:12:42,620
Jotaro's under the assumption
the boy has nothing to do with this,

211
00:12:42,735 --> 00:12:47,768
but little does he know everyone in this cafe
and within sight of this place works for me...

212
00:12:48,814 --> 00:12:51,118
Even the bartender and those men.

213
00:12:51,496 --> 00:12:53,746
No matter what, I can't fail,

214
00:12:53,812 --> 00:12:57,240
as my directive is to make sure Jotaro's hand is weak.

215
00:12:57,265 --> 00:13:00,688
Still, not looking at the cards was a bold move.

216
00:13:00,738 --> 00:13:03,663
He caught me by surprise, albeit briefly.

217
00:13:04,202 --> 00:13:08,235
It's clearly a bluff. How dare he bluff against me?

218
00:13:08,339 --> 00:13:11,736
Does the fool really think I'll lie down and fold?

219
00:13:12,003 --> 00:13:13,658
Hah! Very well.

220
00:13:14,666 --> 00:13:15,926
If that's your game,

221
00:13:16,061 --> 00:13:19,476
I'll match you with six polnareffs, and...

222
00:13:19,531 --> 00:13:21,562
I raise you Joseph's soul.

223
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:25,685
What do you think? 15 chips total.

224
00:13:27,079 --> 00:13:28,453
What?! Hold on a minute!

225
00:13:28,478 --> 00:13:32,861
That's not fair! How can you raise your
ante when Jotaro doesn't have any more chips?

226
00:13:33,071 --> 00:13:34,620
He's out of chips, you say?

227
00:13:34,746 --> 00:13:36,537
There's an easy way to fix that.

228
00:13:36,784 --> 00:13:37,892
What do you mean?

229
00:13:37,917 --> 00:13:40,092
Rectifying your chip conundrum is simple

230
00:13:40,172 --> 00:13:43,008
as long as my stand has a written contract.

231
00:13:43,154 --> 00:13:46,441
Once the deal is done, it'll
have carte Blanche to take a soul.

232
00:13:46,472 --> 00:13:48,951
And exactly whose soul are you talking about?!

233
00:13:49,944 --> 00:13:51,518
Kakyoin's in the hospital.

234
00:13:51,733 --> 00:13:54,001
Why don't you simply bet his soul?

235
00:13:54,499 --> 00:13:55,074
What?!

236
00:13:55,466 --> 00:13:56,927
Panic, fool.

237
00:13:57,055 --> 00:13:59,090
Show me your doubt and fear.

238
00:13:59,115 --> 00:14:01,979
Let me see you lose that cool composure.

239
00:14:02,345 --> 00:14:04,409
How dare he try to bluff me?

240
00:14:04,742 --> 00:14:10,525
After I'm finished with him, that poker face
will be a contorted ball of anguish and misery.

241
00:14:10,881 --> 00:14:12,307
Sounds like a plan.

242
00:14:13,459 --> 00:14:15,457
I'll see your bet with Kakyoin's soul.

243
00:14:18,236 --> 00:14:19,916
Wait! Jotaro, you can't!

244
00:14:19,941 --> 00:14:22,748
Betting a man's soul without his knowledge is so uncouth!

245
00:14:23,314 --> 00:14:24,833
Well, it is kinda selfish.

246
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:31,015
Hey, Jotaro, what did you just do?!

247
00:14:31,442 --> 00:14:33,924
What did I just do? What do you mean by that?

248
00:14:34,345 --> 00:14:35,621
You lit a cigare...

249
00:14:38,566 --> 00:14:39,637
What's wrong with you?

250
00:14:39,827 --> 00:14:41,429
Not feeling well or something?

251
00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:46,836
Impertinent...

252
00:14:47,078 --> 00:14:48,918
Why is he so confident?

253
00:14:49,194 --> 00:14:50,196
Could he have...

254
00:14:50,441 --> 00:14:54,621
Could he have used Star Platinum
to swap the cards without my knowing?

255
00:15:12,422 --> 00:15:13,692
Stupid brat.

256
00:15:13,802 --> 00:15:15,108
What are you thinking?

257
00:15:15,146 --> 00:15:17,181
Don't look at me with that worried grimace

258
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:21,377
if Jotaro finds out you work for me, I'll murder you.

259
00:15:26,778 --> 00:15:29,953
Compose yourself. I have four kings.

260
00:15:30,059 --> 00:15:32,821
The only hands that could beat me are four aces,

261
00:15:32,931 --> 00:15:36,491
a straight flush, or a joker-led five of a kind.

262
00:15:37,724 --> 00:15:40,323
In order to get his mitts on any of those hands,

263
00:15:40,410 --> 00:15:43,126
Jotaro would have to switch all five cards,

264
00:15:43,266 --> 00:15:45,033
a challenge, indeed.

265
00:15:45,183 --> 00:15:49,151
With Star Platinum's speed, there's a
chance he could have switched a card,

266
00:15:49,221 --> 00:15:50,115
But five?

267
00:15:50,216 --> 00:15:54,426
Could he really do that right under my nose? Impossible.

268
00:15:55,722 --> 00:15:58,933
There's no way I could have missed him replacing all five.

269
00:15:59,267 --> 00:16:04,698
I'm the great D'arby, the king of
games, master at the art of gambling.

270
00:16:05,111 --> 00:16:07,200
I've had enough of this, Jotaro.

271
00:16:07,225 --> 00:16:08,970
Your time has come.

272
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:11,861
He lit that cigarette to psych me out,

273
00:16:11,924 --> 00:16:13,619
so now I know he's bluffing.

274
00:16:18,917 --> 00:16:20,449
Ah, you're kidding me?!

275
00:16:20,474 --> 00:16:21,755
You got a drink, too?!

276
00:16:22,085 --> 00:16:23,590
When did you have a chance to...

277
00:16:23,615 --> 00:16:26,174
You bastard! How dare you make fun of me?!

278
00:16:26,479 --> 00:16:27,795
Let's finish this!

279
00:16:27,911 --> 00:16:29,141
My hand is unbeata...

280
00:16:29,166 --> 00:16:29,821
Hold it!

281
00:16:31,041 --> 00:16:33,904
Why are you jumping the gun
when I haven't raised the pot yet?

282
00:16:38,712 --> 00:16:40,274
Raise the pot?! No!

283
00:16:40,354 --> 00:16:42,274
You don't have anything to raise it with!

284
00:16:46,019 --> 00:16:47,205
That's where you're wrong.

285
00:16:47,476 --> 00:16:49,475
I'll raise you with my mother's soul.

286
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:50,782
What?!

287
00:16:51,409 --> 00:16:52,828
Are you out of your mind?!

288
00:16:52,925 --> 00:16:55,432
Jotaro, why would you bet your mother's soul?!

289
00:17:00,184 --> 00:17:03,719
The entire reason I came to Egypt in
the first place was to save my mother,

290
00:17:03,805 --> 00:17:06,400
so if I end up losing here, she'll die anyway.

291
00:17:06,658 --> 00:17:08,193
She won't mind if I bet her soul.

292
00:17:08,746 --> 00:17:13,605
So then, D'arby, for your sake, I hope you have
something to bet that matches my mother's soul.

293
00:17:14,701 --> 00:17:15,514
I know.

294
00:17:16,603 --> 00:17:17,829
For your ante,

295
00:17:17,989 --> 00:17:20,529
I want you to tell me the secret of Dio's stand.

296
00:17:25,716 --> 00:17:27,153
Judging from his reaction,

297
00:17:28,234 --> 00:17:30,221
he indeed knows Dio's secret.

298
00:17:30,562 --> 00:17:31,746
Unfortunately for him,

299
00:17:31,897 --> 00:17:33,989
Dio doesn't take treason sitting down.

300
00:17:34,156 --> 00:17:36,282
If he tells us the information we want to know,

301
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:37,849
he's as good as dead.

302
00:17:40,658 --> 00:17:41,374
Jotaro,

303
00:17:41,745 --> 00:17:44,051
if you're confident enough to bet your mother's soul,

304
00:17:44,076 --> 00:17:45,961
you're sure your hand will win, aren't you?

305
00:17:46,876 --> 00:17:48,789
You wouldn't let us down, would you?

306
00:17:49,227 --> 00:17:50,884
You've got the winning hand, right?

307
00:17:51,376 --> 00:17:52,326
Jotaro?!

308
00:17:59,221 --> 00:17:59,955
Come on!

309
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:01,750
Are you gonna call my bluff or fold?!

310
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:04,142
Decision time! Spit it out already!

311
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:05,615
D'arby!

312
00:18:16,127 --> 00:18:17,030
I'll say it.

313
00:18:23,843 --> 00:18:26,231
I'll say it, damn it!

314
00:18:31,809 --> 00:18:32,823
I'll say it!

315
00:18:32,975 --> 00:18:34,964
I'm the world's greatest gambler!

316
00:18:34,989 --> 00:18:37,831
I can do this. I'll call!

317
00:18:40,374 --> 00:18:43,669
Call, call, call, call, call,

318
00:18:43,736 --> 00:18:46,639
call, call, call, call.

319
00:18:46,972 --> 00:18:50,872
I'm going to call!

320
00:18:50,996 --> 00:18:52,364
Ca...

321
00:18:56,502 --> 00:18:59,071
C-c-c-c-c-ca... ca...

322
00:19:04,226 --> 00:19:05,139
C-c...

323
00:19:12,309 --> 00:19:13,071
C-c...

324
00:19:16,804 --> 00:19:17,477
C-c...

325
00:19:18,097 --> 00:19:20,648
I can't do it! I'm petrified!

326
00:19:20,779 --> 00:19:23,402
I'm too terrified to say the words!

327
00:19:24,177 --> 00:19:26,077
C-c-c-ca...

328
00:19:26,907 --> 00:19:29,887
I... I can't... I can't breathe.

329
00:19:32,879 --> 00:19:33,886
C-c-c-c...

330
00:19:36,602 --> 00:19:37,080
Hmph.

331
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:39,773
Ca...

332
00:19:40,638 --> 00:19:41,995
That's unbelievable!

333
00:19:42,188 --> 00:19:44,336
His eyes rolled into the back of his head!

334
00:19:45,258 --> 00:19:48,588
How is it possible for someone to
faint while they're on their feet?

335
00:19:48,613 --> 00:19:50,055
He's completely lost it.

336
00:19:50,104 --> 00:19:51,620
The pressure was too much.

337
00:19:57,847 --> 00:20:02,140
Mr. Joestar and Polnareff's souls are
returning to their bodies! Thank heavens.

338
00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:07,611
Mentally, he's already forfeited the game.

339
00:20:08,343 --> 00:20:10,270
Deep down, he knew he had lost.

340
00:20:10,676 --> 00:20:12,390
That's why the souls were released.

341
00:20:13,403 --> 00:20:14,936
F-four kings?!

342
00:20:15,094 --> 00:20:17,675
Are you telling me he had four kings all along?

343
00:20:18,243 --> 00:20:22,669
Jotaro, I have to know what cards you
had in your hand to inspire such confidence.

344
00:20:26,879 --> 00:20:27,912
Like I thought...

345
00:20:29,956 --> 00:20:32,857
Your hand was shit, absolute shit!

346
00:20:33,341 --> 00:20:35,532
Even with Star Platinum's incredible speed,

347
00:20:35,598 --> 00:20:39,142
he wouldn't have been able to swap cards
in front of an expert gambler like D'arby.

348
00:20:39,251 --> 00:20:42,190
It's a good thing my bluff and intimidation worked so well

349
00:20:42,621 --> 00:20:44,283
with such a worthless hand.

350
00:20:44,418 --> 00:20:47,622
Good grief. Had I known it was
this crappy, I would have freaked.

351
00:20:47,666 --> 00:20:49,663
What? What do you mean you'd have freaked?!

352
00:20:49,688 --> 00:20:51,078
Jotaro, don't tell me

353
00:20:51,290 --> 00:20:53,771
that you bet our souls on that worthless hand!

354
00:20:53,985 --> 00:20:54,637
Eh?

355
00:21:10,399 --> 00:21:13,719
It would appear as though his
collection of souls has been released.

356
00:21:13,853 --> 00:21:17,772
Come on, everyone! Let's play a game of mahjong!

357
00:21:17,864 --> 00:21:20,087
Backgammon is a lot of fun, too!

358
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:24,120
Or we could play a game of
dice, even though I don't have any!

359
00:21:24,279 --> 00:21:26,979
D'arby of the Osiris stand, retired.

360
00:21:28,503 --> 00:21:32,191
I doubt that we'll be able to pry
Dio's secret out of him in this state.

361
00:21:32,491 --> 00:21:35,092
That's true. He was a formidable opponent.

362
00:21:35,507 --> 00:21:38,915
It's humbling to admit this, but he
almost took us all out singlehandedly.

363
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:40,846
The guy was a force to be reckoned with.

364
00:21:41,199 --> 00:21:43,580
Indeed, he was a fierce adversary.

365
00:21:43,987 --> 00:21:45,871
I feel like death warmed over.

366
00:21:46,915 --> 00:21:49,969
Well, I guess we can't be the heroes in every episode.
