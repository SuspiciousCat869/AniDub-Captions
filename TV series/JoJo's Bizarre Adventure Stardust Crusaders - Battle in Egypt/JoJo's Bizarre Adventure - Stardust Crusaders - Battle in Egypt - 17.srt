1
00:00:01,907 --> 00:00:03,952
They're about to exit the tunnel!

2
00:00:06,241 --> 00:00:08,794
No! Not good! Darby's ahead

3
00:00:08,988 --> 00:00:10,611
and by a full car length!

4
00:00:10,781 --> 00:00:12,571
Our speed is about to be doubled.

5
00:00:12,831 --> 00:00:14,506
It looks like I win!

6
00:00:15,693 --> 00:00:20,470
No! The fact of the matter is I
still have more speed than you, Darby.

7
00:00:22,113 --> 00:00:23,541
You're in for it now.

8
00:00:28,373 --> 00:00:30,134
I can't believe what I'm seeing!

9
00:00:30,885 --> 00:00:36,057
Kakyoin had enough power to spin his car around
and knock Darby's car clear off the racetrack!

10
00:00:36,421 --> 00:00:38,519
He used his speed to his advantage.

11
00:00:39,384 --> 00:00:41,147
He's out of there!

12
00:00:42,213 --> 00:00:44,935
And Kakyoin's car is safely on the ground.

13
00:00:45,182 --> 00:00:46,579
You did it!

14
00:00:47,167 --> 00:00:49,400
The weaker car loses in a collision.

15
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:52,956
Giving up power to ram me will
prove to be a costly mistake.

16
00:00:53,186 --> 00:00:56,795
Instead of gloating, you should have
paid more attention to my plan to stay behind

17
00:00:56,819 --> 00:00:59,026
and knock you off course with a spin attack.

18
00:00:59,904 --> 00:01:01,001
So you say,

19
00:01:01,266 --> 00:01:03,512
though the same could also be said of you.

20
00:01:04,344 --> 00:01:06,726
Losing power was not an accident.

21
00:01:07,206 --> 00:01:09,039
You're so self-righteous.

22
00:01:09,308 --> 00:01:13,288
In your hubris, you didn't realize I
planned for you to knock my car off course.

23
00:01:14,455 --> 00:01:16,743
Everything rests on this.

24
00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:20,367
Look closely. Do you see where my car is headed?

25
00:01:20,921 --> 00:01:21,748
Ohh!

26
00:01:21,773 --> 00:01:22,275
What?

27
00:01:30,425 --> 00:01:32,305
He landed on the other side,

28
00:01:32,351 --> 00:01:33,758
farther ahead, at that.

29
00:01:33,906 --> 00:01:34,938
Impossible.

30
00:01:35,293 --> 00:01:37,357
Yes, ordinarily.

31
00:01:37,597 --> 00:01:42,715
Even at one's top speed, a move like the
one I just did usually would result in a crash.

32
00:01:42,888 --> 00:01:45,297
You wouldn't make it by jumping over the curves,

33
00:01:45,712 --> 00:01:49,542
but it's another story completely
if you're catapulted over them.

34
00:01:50,282 --> 00:01:52,175
All I needed was your help.

35
00:01:53,185 --> 00:01:58,357
From the moment we left the tunnel, my plan
was to get you to hit me by sacrificing my power.

36
00:01:58,972 --> 00:02:02,678
That said, I think it's time we continued our race.

37
00:02:02,968 --> 00:02:04,205
Don't you?

38
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:07,581
Don't let this guy get to you, Kakyoin!

39
00:02:07,606 --> 00:02:08,570
Stay focused!

40
00:02:14,614 --> 00:02:15,847
Kakyoin!

41
00:02:15,987 --> 00:02:16,774
There.

42
00:02:16,941 --> 00:02:19,711
Now his soul belongs to me.

43
00:02:19,791 --> 00:02:22,201
The poor fool admitted defeat.

44
00:02:23,161 --> 00:02:26,807
He finally realized that it
was pointless to continue racing.

45
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:35,002
Still, I must say, you, Kakyoin, are the
first opponent to ever make me perspire like this.

46
00:02:41,466 --> 00:02:46,925
Given its source material, this doll will make a
most exquisite addition to my growing collection.

47
00:02:48,126 --> 00:02:51,925
He was the very first opponent to
muster up the courage to conquer his fears

48
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:55,032
and resist cracking under such colossal pressure.

49
00:02:57,690 --> 00:02:59,362
No. Kakyoin.

50
00:03:03,118 --> 00:03:06,757
I will treasure his good company always.

51
00:03:08,587 --> 00:03:09,367
Careful.

52
00:03:09,461 --> 00:03:14,104
It would be in the best interest of all
involved for you to keep your emotions in check.

53
00:03:14,252 --> 00:03:16,297
Harming me is out of the question.

54
00:03:16,468 --> 00:03:20,800
You see, dying is something I simply
can't do if you want your friend back.

55
00:03:20,866 --> 00:03:23,477
Slipping on a banana peel and hitting my head,

56
00:03:23,502 --> 00:03:28,680
choking on gum, or even suffering a heart
attack from the shock of popping a bag of popcorn,

57
00:03:29,122 --> 00:03:31,847
if any of those things sent me to heaven,

58
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,222
Kakyoin's soul would go, too.

59
00:05:18,987 --> 00:05:21,361
What the... Hey, Jotaro, wait!

60
00:05:21,461 --> 00:05:22,362
What's this?

61
00:05:22,387 --> 00:05:23,689
Hey, Jotaro,

62
00:05:23,833 --> 00:05:25,269
why the hell are you sitting down?

63
00:05:25,294 --> 00:05:27,263
We should be kicking Geppetto's ass.

64
00:05:27,288 --> 00:05:28,754
I'll play him next.

65
00:05:28,912 --> 00:05:29,825
Old man,

66
00:05:30,007 --> 00:05:32,402
have you ever actually played any of these games?

67
00:05:32,495 --> 00:05:34,782
If not, the odds wouldn't be in your favor.

68
00:05:37,894 --> 00:05:39,655
Stay out of it, old man.

69
00:05:39,788 --> 00:05:42,490
This isn't your average game of gin rummy, after all.

70
00:05:45,036 --> 00:05:46,558
We're playing baseball.

71
00:05:47,007 --> 00:05:50,561
That's the game I choose to settle this once and for all.

72
00:05:52,585 --> 00:05:54,693
As collateral, I'll bet my soul.

73
00:05:55,023 --> 00:05:58,557
All right. Then I would like to bet Kakyoin's soul.

74
00:06:00,838 --> 00:06:03,511
My stand Atum has released your arm.

75
00:06:03,606 --> 00:06:05,246
You may thank me at your leisure.

76
00:06:06,094 --> 00:06:08,716
Now that Kakyoin's soul is in my collection,

77
00:06:08,777 --> 00:06:12,711
there's no longer reason for me to
keep your arm in my stand's clutches.

78
00:06:12,875 --> 00:06:19,315
And suffice it to say I'd be at a bit of a
disadvantage if I faced you with my stand one-handed.

79
00:06:19,422 --> 00:06:23,312
I'm well aware of your Star Platinum's
incredible speed and precision.

80
00:06:25,392 --> 00:06:28,447
Really, out of all the games
you could have chosen to play...

81
00:06:30,435 --> 00:06:33,611
it's unfortunate for you that we're playing my specialty.

82
00:06:34,002 --> 00:06:35,980
Darby, just you wait.

83
00:06:36,005 --> 00:06:38,231
The moment Jotaro wipes the floor with you,

84
00:06:38,256 --> 00:06:41,884
I'll throttle the life out of your
pompous ass, and that is a promise.

85
00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:49,443
"Oh! That's a baseball!"

86
00:06:52,922 --> 00:06:55,349
Doesn't look like he's tampered with this game either.

87
00:06:55,522 --> 00:06:56,575
You're good to go.

88
00:06:57,739 --> 00:07:00,052
Before we begin, you'll need to pick your team.

89
00:07:03,204 --> 00:07:04,159
Jaguars.

90
00:07:04,453 --> 00:07:05,730
Jaguars!

91
00:07:06,934 --> 00:07:11,955
Yes, I see. You've decided to go with
a team that has a strong offense, eh?

92
00:07:12,053 --> 00:07:14,627
And two with a batting average over .400.

93
00:07:14,773 --> 00:07:18,101
If that's how you're going to
play it, I'll choose the Red Dragons.

94
00:07:18,126 --> 00:07:19,840
Red Dragons!

95
00:07:20,792 --> 00:07:22,298
Offense or defense?

96
00:07:22,338 --> 00:07:23,804
Go on. Take your pick.

97
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:26,133
Offense.

98
00:07:26,253 --> 00:07:27,317
In that case,

99
00:07:27,364 --> 00:07:29,666
the Jaguars will bat first.

100
00:07:30,762 --> 00:07:35,370
Next, you can begin designing your own
players by drawing their faces on the screen.

101
00:07:36,499 --> 00:07:39,624
This handsome devil is Star Platinum.

102
00:07:41,391 --> 00:07:44,250
Now that we've gotten the preparations out of the way,

103
00:07:44,956 --> 00:07:46,056
play ball?

104
00:07:48,815 --> 00:07:51,867
Jaguars versus Red Dragons!

105
00:07:52,394 --> 00:07:53,547
Play ball!

106
00:08:01,307 --> 00:08:03,871
I've chosen number 15 as my pitcher.

107
00:08:04,086 --> 00:08:06,459
January fifth is my birthday, you know.

108
00:08:09,767 --> 00:08:11,282
Now, here we go.

109
00:08:11,727 --> 00:08:13,350
The pitcher is winding up.

110
00:08:15,076 --> 00:08:16,538
The first pitch.

111
00:08:18,152 --> 00:08:18,997
What?!

112
00:08:21,085 --> 00:08:22,092
Strike one.

113
00:08:23,022 --> 00:08:25,173
Uh, hey, I don't get it.

114
00:08:25,353 --> 00:08:26,193
What's wrong?

115
00:08:26,228 --> 00:08:28,263
That was a pretty amateur move back there.

116
00:08:28,296 --> 00:08:32,700
It's great that you swung the bat and
all, but it was before he even threw the ball!

117
00:08:35,603 --> 00:08:36,065
Hmm?

118
00:08:39,713 --> 00:08:41,803
Hey, what's this all about?

119
00:08:42,097 --> 00:08:44,776
There's no need for you to practice your swing, is there?

120
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:50,828
Hang on. Jotaro, is this the very
first time you've ever played this?

121
00:08:51,147 --> 00:08:54,301
In fact, have you ever played a video game in your life?

122
00:08:55,317 --> 00:08:57,685
You answer me right now, Jotaro!

123
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:01,150
Relax. I already know how to play baseball.

124
00:09:01,417 --> 00:09:03,527
I'll figure out the game controls as I go.

125
00:09:03,641 --> 00:09:04,147
Huh?

126
00:09:04,528 --> 00:09:06,746
W-What are you saying?!

127
00:09:06,912 --> 00:09:09,888
In case you haven't noticed, your timing is totally off.

128
00:09:10,328 --> 00:09:11,908
Your swings are pathetic.

129
00:09:12,179 --> 00:09:14,803
Don't lie. This is your first time playing, isn't it?

130
00:09:24,589 --> 00:09:25,465
Strike two.

131
00:09:27,266 --> 00:09:30,913
And now you're actually swinging the
bat after the catcher has caught the ball.

132
00:09:31,079 --> 00:09:32,565
You don't know what you're doing!

133
00:09:32,686 --> 00:09:34,551
Damn it, Jotaro. I was right.

134
00:09:34,618 --> 00:09:36,993
You don't know a video game from a hole in the ground.

135
00:09:37,559 --> 00:09:39,170
Strike. Batter out.

136
00:09:40,589 --> 00:09:42,631
Jotaro, it's time to get serious!

137
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:45,119
Stop trying to act cool, and use your blasted head!

138
00:09:45,209 --> 00:09:50,171
You bet your soul on this game, so if you think you
can back out due to lack of experience, think again.

139
00:09:50,198 --> 00:09:51,264
Good grief.

140
00:09:51,476 --> 00:09:53,628
This is the worst pep talk I've ever heard.

141
00:09:53,938 --> 00:09:55,630
You should be more encouraging.

142
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:57,820
Try something like, "it's only the first inning.

143
00:09:57,875 --> 00:09:59,209
You can still make a comeback."

144
00:09:59,234 --> 00:10:01,257
What the hell's going through that head of yours?

145
00:10:01,366 --> 00:10:06,071
You can't possibly rely solely on Star
Platinum's reflexes to win this game, can you?

146
00:10:06,095 --> 00:10:06,868
Think about it.

147
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:09,088
You don't know the first thing about video games.

148
00:10:09,113 --> 00:10:10,568
How are you supposed to beat him?

149
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:13,478
What's your plan, Jotaro?

150
00:10:13,531 --> 00:10:14,788
Answer me, damn it!

151
00:10:14,813 --> 00:10:17,236
Do you have a way to beat this weirdo or not?

152
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:19,847
Jotaro...

153
00:10:19,907 --> 00:10:20,366
Hmm?

154
00:10:21,331 --> 00:10:25,231
Listen, if your strategy is to trick
me by pretending to be an amateur,

155
00:10:25,256 --> 00:10:27,789
let me inform you that it isn't going to work.

156
00:10:28,913 --> 00:10:31,626
I'd never be foolish enough to let my guard down.

157
00:10:31,737 --> 00:10:34,556
Even if you were a helpless child, it wouldn't happen.

158
00:10:34,726 --> 00:10:36,611
A soul is at stake.

159
00:10:37,621 --> 00:10:38,383
Old man.

160
00:10:38,408 --> 00:10:39,628
Eh? Huh?

161
00:10:39,932 --> 00:10:42,306
Since you wanted to know, I don't have a plan.

162
00:10:43,058 --> 00:10:45,516
However, if I did have one,

163
00:10:45,914 --> 00:10:47,124
the only thing it would involve

164
00:10:47,149 --> 00:10:51,993
would be knocking the nose straight off the face of
this condescending, over-inflated douche bag of a prick

165
00:10:52,027 --> 00:10:53,628
taking up space beside me.

166
00:10:54,092 --> 00:10:56,832
All I care about is getting Kakyoin's soul back.

167
00:10:57,395 --> 00:10:58,986
I'll do whatever it takes.

168
00:11:01,126 --> 00:11:02,579
You talk a big game,

169
00:11:02,685 --> 00:11:05,593
but it's still the top of the
first inning, and you have one out.

170
00:11:05,618 --> 00:11:07,417
The match is far from over.

171
00:11:07,659 --> 00:11:13,946
And since you haven't played before, you should know
that if you fall more than 11 points behind, you lose.

172
00:11:18,236 --> 00:11:20,709
Second batter, number 3.

173
00:11:24,601 --> 00:11:25,601
Strike.

174
00:11:26,158 --> 00:11:28,233
Damn, he's getting even worse.

175
00:11:28,259 --> 00:11:32,635
That time, he swung the bat over 40
centimeters above the ball. How's he so bad?

176
00:11:33,243 --> 00:11:34,429
Strike two.

177
00:11:34,839 --> 00:11:36,736
What? It wasn't even close.

178
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:42,933
Strike three. You're out.

179
00:11:44,930 --> 00:11:46,054
It's all over.

180
00:11:46,438 --> 00:11:49,038
Jotaro's no match for someone like Darby.

181
00:11:49,367 --> 00:11:53,154
This massacre is like being forced to
watch a group of high school baseball champs

182
00:11:53,179 --> 00:11:55,428
go head-to-head with kids from the knitting club!

183
00:11:56,133 --> 00:11:57,620
It's pathetic.

184
00:11:57,947 --> 00:11:58,924
Strike one.

185
00:11:59,029 --> 00:11:59,842
Strike two.

186
00:12:02,374 --> 00:12:04,249
So it wasn't a bluff.

187
00:12:04,308 --> 00:12:07,175
He really is a beginner. This is too easy.

188
00:12:07,343 --> 00:12:12,663
In the same way a judo pro can Gauge his opponent's
skill simply by looking at the way he wears his gi,

189
00:12:12,804 --> 00:12:14,709
I can read him like a book,

190
00:12:14,875 --> 00:12:18,762
and chapter one is called,
"Jotaro, the video game novice."

191
00:12:19,613 --> 00:12:22,753
All the same, I refuse to let my guard down.

192
00:12:23,652 --> 00:12:26,976
I'm aware of the weaknesses of every batter in this game.

193
00:12:27,401 --> 00:12:30,147
Next will be a low pitch to the outside.

194
00:12:30,522 --> 00:12:32,257
I'll throw my best pitch,

195
00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:35,188
the four-seam fast ball, and strike him out.

196
00:12:35,427 --> 00:12:36,669
It's the first inning.

197
00:12:36,786 --> 00:12:39,306
Two outs, two strikes, and no fouls.

198
00:12:39,408 --> 00:12:40,996
Here comes my next pitch.

199
00:12:41,021 --> 00:12:42,196
Go right ahead.

200
00:12:42,513 --> 00:12:45,422
I've pretty much gotten the hang
of batting with the controller.

201
00:12:46,524 --> 00:12:48,393
Wait. What did he just say?

202
00:12:48,533 --> 00:12:49,819
I must have heard him wrong.

203
00:12:51,141 --> 00:12:53,153
What does he mean, "got the hang of it"?

204
00:12:54,893 --> 00:12:56,677
Surely, he couldn't have...

205
00:12:58,718 --> 00:13:00,167
What is he talking about?

206
00:13:00,318 --> 00:13:01,640
What does he mean?

207
00:13:07,683 --> 00:13:08,518
What?!

208
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:10,090
Jotaro!

209
00:13:10,263 --> 00:13:13,140
All right. I'm really starting to enjoy this game.

210
00:13:13,474 --> 00:13:15,478
What in the... it can't be!

211
00:13:15,506 --> 00:13:18,897
It's going! The ball is still going!

212
00:13:18,923 --> 00:13:20,430
It just doesn't make sense.

213
00:13:20,906 --> 00:13:22,847
What did he mean by, "got the hang of it"?

214
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:26,373
"Got the hang of it"? "Got the hang of it"?

215
00:13:29,781 --> 00:13:31,351
He... he did it!

216
00:13:31,688 --> 00:13:34,350
I don't know how, but he did it!

217
00:13:36,174 --> 00:13:38,160
Home run!

218
00:13:44,889 --> 00:13:47,793
Home run! It's a home run!

219
00:13:50,798 --> 00:13:52,745
Jotaro, damn you.

220
00:14:03,001 --> 00:14:03,748
Jotaro...

221
00:14:04,023 --> 00:14:05,713
Did I really hear you correctly?

222
00:14:05,961 --> 00:14:09,957
Say something. It sounded like you'd,
"pretty much gotten the hang of batting."

223
00:14:10,437 --> 00:14:12,490
I don't feel like repeating myself.

224
00:14:15,071 --> 00:14:17,273
He was a beginner when we started this game,

225
00:14:17,306 --> 00:14:21,876
and yet he's claiming to have learned
proper swinging technique in only eight pitches.

226
00:14:22,875 --> 00:14:27,012
Jotaro Kujo has all the speed
and dexterity of Star Platinum.

227
00:14:27,665 --> 00:14:32,179
Now I know why master Dio finds him to
be problematic and why my brother lost.

228
00:14:37,838 --> 00:14:38,822
Interesting.

229
00:14:38,909 --> 00:14:41,370
I couldn't have asked for a more fitting opponent.

230
00:14:42,056 --> 00:14:44,713
But as naturally gifted as you may be,

231
00:14:44,765 --> 00:14:48,923
you made a critical mistake by revealing
your talents so early in the game,

232
00:14:49,933 --> 00:14:52,755
a mistake that will cost you dearly.

233
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:58,090
Let's resume the game, Jotaro.

234
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:04,994
Yes, he did it!

235
00:15:05,328 --> 00:15:06,721
That's my boy!

236
00:15:06,746 --> 00:15:09,044
Another home run right out of the park!

237
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:11,043
Talk about a comeback.

238
00:15:11,168 --> 00:15:12,808
Four runs in the first inning.

239
00:15:12,979 --> 00:15:15,476
Looks like you've got this game in the bag, Jotaro.

240
00:15:16,316 --> 00:15:18,745
Keep it up, and we'll be out of here in no time.

241
00:15:19,181 --> 00:15:22,231
Hey, Darby, you'll just ignore me,

242
00:15:22,343 --> 00:15:24,882
but I'll say it anyway, because I'm a nice guy.

243
00:15:25,155 --> 00:15:26,201
I'm giving you an out.

244
00:15:26,255 --> 00:15:28,760
All you have to do is return Kakyoin's soul

245
00:15:28,827 --> 00:15:30,887
and take us to Dio of your own volition.

246
00:15:31,124 --> 00:15:33,530
If you cooperate, no harm will befall you.

247
00:15:39,137 --> 00:15:39,651
Huh?

248
00:15:40,677 --> 00:15:43,814
For all his faults, my brother was a master gambler.

249
00:15:43,883 --> 00:15:46,229
He made conning people into an art form.

250
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:50,428
You'd think his younger brother
would be perfect to practice on,

251
00:15:50,835 --> 00:15:52,064
but you'd be wrong.

252
00:15:52,138 --> 00:15:54,644
He never asked me to play one game of poker.

253
00:15:54,841 --> 00:15:58,677
No, I was never asked to play any
games of the gambling persuasion.

254
00:15:59,047 --> 00:16:00,701
Any guesses why?

255
00:16:02,757 --> 00:16:07,931
When I was 15, I caught my brother putting
his oh-so-predictable moves on my girlfriend.

256
00:16:08,257 --> 00:16:11,244
He was ten years older, but I beat him to a bloody pulp.

257
00:16:11,484 --> 00:16:15,263
I broke his ribs and proceeded
to kick him until he spat blood.

258
00:16:15,389 --> 00:16:18,661
The last thing my brother said to me was how sorry he was.

259
00:16:18,874 --> 00:16:20,563
Any idea why?

260
00:16:20,869 --> 00:16:23,093
Would you please cut to the chase already?

261
00:16:23,149 --> 00:16:28,454
Even as kids, my brother had the good sense to
realize that he'd never have what it took to beat me.

262
00:16:28,568 --> 00:16:31,857
The reason for that is about to become abundantly clear.

263
00:16:32,918 --> 00:16:37,891
At this moment, you have a false sense
of confidence due to the home run you hit,

264
00:16:37,958 --> 00:16:42,390
but deep down, you feel a sense of
unease, not unlike what my brother felt.

265
00:16:42,697 --> 00:16:45,418
My prowess is beginning to worry you, isn't it?

266
00:16:45,658 --> 00:16:51,097
Right now you're coming to a daunting conclusion
about the game's outcome, aren't you, Jotaro?

267
00:16:51,144 --> 00:16:52,865
What the hell are you talking about?

268
00:16:55,366 --> 00:16:56,679
Changing pitchers!

269
00:16:56,807 --> 00:16:59,615
Number 15 is out, and number 77 is in.

270
00:17:00,061 --> 00:17:05,487
77 is a power pitcher with a Max
pitch speed of 165 kilometers per hour.

271
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:09,352
Also, I'll tell you the pitch I'll throw.

272
00:17:10,754 --> 00:17:12,915
Number 77 will throw a forkball,

273
00:17:13,155 --> 00:17:15,276
and he'll throw it right down the middle.

274
00:17:15,796 --> 00:17:16,908
What the hell?!

275
00:17:17,462 --> 00:17:19,287
Why would he declare what he's throwing?!

276
00:17:19,312 --> 00:17:22,293
A forkball is about to come barreling down center.

277
00:17:22,353 --> 00:17:24,240
But will you believe me or not?

278
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:27,832
Jotaro, he's just spouting
nonsense to shake your confidence.

279
00:17:27,859 --> 00:17:30,628
Do yourself a favor, and ignore everything he says.

280
00:17:31,304 --> 00:17:32,771
Throw it, Darby.

281
00:17:33,521 --> 00:17:36,019
Will you believe, or will you doubt?

282
00:17:41,983 --> 00:17:45,307
I knew it. It's a fastball, and it's coming right at you.

283
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:48,173
Let's see. Is the ball going to change direction?

284
00:17:48,533 --> 00:17:50,761
The suspense is driving me crazy!

285
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:53,060
You swung!

286
00:17:53,239 --> 00:17:55,683
You bought his act and bet on the forkball!

287
00:17:55,739 --> 00:17:59,200
It's still going. It actually is a fastball!

288
00:18:00,078 --> 00:18:02,400
Oh, great. He hit the bottom of the ball.

289
00:18:04,431 --> 00:18:05,198
Out.

290
00:18:05,784 --> 00:18:08,271
First inning, three outs. Change.

291
00:18:12,365 --> 00:18:14,059
Idiot. How could you?!

292
00:18:14,272 --> 00:18:16,516
Leave it to a rookie for something like that.

293
00:18:16,634 --> 00:18:19,001
I can't believe you swung for a forkball.

294
00:18:21,096 --> 00:18:21,636
No.

295
00:18:22,242 --> 00:18:26,111
He had already seen through me and
knew I would swing expecting a forkball,

296
00:18:26,437 --> 00:18:28,418
so he switched it up to a fastball.

297
00:18:28,918 --> 00:18:30,325
But he has a point, though.

298
00:18:30,504 --> 00:18:33,633
Something's been gnawing at me ever
since we stepped foot in this mansion.

299
00:18:34,299 --> 00:18:39,380
I'm not sure how, but he knew Star Platinum
would throw a right punch in our earlier skirmish.

300
00:18:39,819 --> 00:18:41,781
What? Impossible!

301
00:18:42,149 --> 00:18:44,376
Are you trying to tell me that he can read your mind?

302
00:18:44,462 --> 00:18:46,895
No offense, Jotaro, but that's crazy talk.

303
00:18:48,208 --> 00:18:49,868
Oh, would you look at that?

304
00:18:49,954 --> 00:18:51,440
It's my turn at bat.

305
00:18:59,492 --> 00:18:59,987
Eh?

306
00:19:01,186 --> 00:19:03,021
This is going to be a home run.

307
00:19:03,748 --> 00:19:07,745
Keep your eye on the birdie, as I'll be
hitting it into the left-field bleachers.

308
00:19:09,799 --> 00:19:14,293
Old man, are you absolutely sure the
game and console haven't been tampered with?

309
00:19:14,318 --> 00:19:15,922
Yeah, I'm positive it's clean,

310
00:19:16,242 --> 00:19:17,342
and that's not all.

311
00:19:17,515 --> 00:19:20,028
I haven't seen him make a single funny move either.

312
00:19:20,521 --> 00:19:23,094
Then his secret weapon has to be that stand of his.

313
00:19:23,213 --> 00:19:25,112
His stand doesn't just take souls.

314
00:19:25,499 --> 00:19:27,106
It must have some other ability.

315
00:19:29,790 --> 00:19:31,153
This'll be my target.

316
00:19:35,081 --> 00:19:36,862
Now I'll get to the bottom of this.

317
00:19:37,463 --> 00:19:38,962
Has he lost his mind?

318
00:19:39,203 --> 00:19:41,505
He's going to try to hit the batter on purpose?

319
00:19:41,985 --> 00:19:44,371
And where might you be aiming now, Jotaro,

320
00:19:44,575 --> 00:19:45,872
an inside pitch?

321
00:19:46,391 --> 00:19:49,430
Will you throw it high or low, perhaps?

322
00:19:49,524 --> 00:19:52,641
Or maybe you're planning some kind of underhanded trick?

323
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:53,501
Well?

324
00:20:02,139 --> 00:20:02,904
What the...

325
00:20:03,081 --> 00:20:05,263
He pulled back when Jotaro threw the ball!

326
00:20:09,233 --> 00:20:11,006
He predicted it.

327
00:20:11,466 --> 00:20:14,856
He knew exactly what would happen. But how?

328
00:20:15,217 --> 00:20:18,917
There's no way he could have seen that
pitch coming unless he read Jotaro's mind!

329
00:20:19,117 --> 00:20:20,545
Home run!

330
00:20:23,886 --> 00:20:24,843
That's one run.

331
00:20:25,619 --> 00:20:29,841
Damn this bastard. We've faced all
kinds of opponents on this journey,

332
00:20:30,076 --> 00:20:32,129
but never one who could read our minds.

333
00:20:32,278 --> 00:20:36,096
If he really can read minds, then it
doesn't matter how clever we think we are.

334
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:38,580
We won't stand a snowball's chance in hell.

335
00:20:39,099 --> 00:20:41,399
Jotaro, what are you going to do?

336
00:20:54,395 --> 00:20:55,555
Why, that...

337
00:20:55,635 --> 00:20:58,037
Damn, the punk's declaring another home run.

338
00:20:58,406 --> 00:21:01,351
Let's see. Heh. An outside pitch?

339
00:21:02,549 --> 00:21:04,374
Or maybe you're going to aim low?

340
00:21:04,618 --> 00:21:06,749
Or something in the vein of a fastball?

341
00:21:18,371 --> 00:21:19,771
Home run!

342
00:21:20,593 --> 00:21:21,893
Four to two.

343
00:21:24,178 --> 00:21:26,391
Damn. A person's body language

344
00:21:26,444 --> 00:21:30,924
and the surrounding environment go a long way
toward helping predict an opponent's next move,

345
00:21:30,951 --> 00:21:37,509
but there's no way to do it perfectly, and yet
his stand predicts Jotaro's pitch with 100% accuracy.

346
00:21:37,651 --> 00:21:39,611
And technically he's not cheating.

347
00:21:41,414 --> 00:21:42,654
Another home run!

348
00:21:42,803 --> 00:21:44,189
It's four to three.

349
00:21:44,691 --> 00:21:48,439
How are we supposed to stop
him from reading our minds? How?

350
00:21:52,359 --> 00:21:54,850
At this rate, I'll be in the lead in no time.

351
00:21:55,083 --> 00:22:00,351
Now what's next? An inside pitch, a
fastball, a high pitch, or maybe a curveball?

352
00:22:00,667 --> 00:22:02,195
What's up your sleeve?

353
00:22:04,751 --> 00:22:05,343
Huh?

354
00:22:06,973 --> 00:22:07,604
Your hat...

355
00:22:08,368 --> 00:22:09,331
You idiot.

356
00:22:09,448 --> 00:22:13,199
Do you honestly take me for a
cheat like my ne'er-do-well brother?

357
00:22:13,427 --> 00:22:15,020
Jotaro, you've got it wrong.

358
00:22:15,202 --> 00:22:16,979
Hiding your face is useless.

359
00:22:17,097 --> 00:22:21,434
I don't know what he's doing, but he's not
watching the reflection of the screen in your eyes.

360
00:22:21,474 --> 00:22:23,735
I get that it's hard not to go there now,

361
00:22:23,876 --> 00:22:27,576
but there's no way he can see what you're
pressing or what pitch you're choosing.

362
00:22:27,808 --> 00:22:30,134
Trust me. I've been watching him the entire time.

363
00:22:30,364 --> 00:22:32,339
That's not what's been going on here.

364
00:22:32,364 --> 00:22:34,499
I only took off my hat, because I'm sweating,

365
00:22:34,869 --> 00:22:35,880
no other reason.

366
00:22:35,904 --> 00:22:36,445
Huh?

367
00:22:36,470 --> 00:22:39,280
Could you throw your next pitch sometime this year?

368
00:22:40,787 --> 00:22:43,425
But I'm not going to be sweating anymore.

369
00:22:43,757 --> 00:22:45,374
I'll tell you my next pitch.

370
00:22:46,593 --> 00:22:48,984
I'm throwing a high, outside fastball.

371
00:22:49,335 --> 00:22:50,549
You're joking.

372
00:22:50,763 --> 00:22:53,722
Jotaro, do you hear what you're saying right now?

373
00:22:54,166 --> 00:22:55,350
Of course I do.

374
00:22:55,815 --> 00:22:58,128
Finally starting to lose your hearing, old man?

375
00:22:58,451 --> 00:23:00,767
Obviously I just told him my next pitch.

376
00:23:01,094 --> 00:23:03,926
A high, outside fastball, that's how I'm gonna win.

377
00:23:07,287 --> 00:23:09,887
Eh? Jotaro?

378
00:23:13,694 --> 00:23:16,676
Will you believe me, or will you doubt me?

379
00:23:19,933 --> 00:23:21,683
You're not too bright, are you?
