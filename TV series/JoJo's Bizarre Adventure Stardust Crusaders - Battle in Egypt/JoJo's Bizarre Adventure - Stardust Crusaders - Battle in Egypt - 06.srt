1
00:00:04,973 --> 00:00:06,408
Rise and shine, sir.

2
00:00:06,459 --> 00:00:09,738
Mr. Kakyoin, are you feeling any better today?

3
00:00:10,545 --> 00:00:11,956
To be perfectly honest,

4
00:00:11,981 --> 00:00:14,714
this new way of life isn't exactly agreeing with me.

5
00:00:15,128 --> 00:00:16,702
I'm feeling a little on edge.

6
00:00:16,736 --> 00:00:18,753
And have you had any discomfort?

7
00:00:19,118 --> 00:00:20,675
No, I haven't, actually.

8
00:00:20,727 --> 00:00:22,307
The painkillers must be working.

9
00:00:22,687 --> 00:00:24,676
Good. Excellent news.

10
00:00:24,829 --> 00:00:27,066
We're thrilled that you're feeling better.

11
00:00:27,213 --> 00:00:29,392
So, doctor, about these,

12
00:00:29,727 --> 00:00:31,334
how long will I have to keep them on?

13
00:00:32,091 --> 00:00:34,933
The thing is I can't afford to wait any longer.

14
00:00:37,063 --> 00:00:42,563
Look, Kakyoin, while your eyes will recover,
your condition is nothing to be taken lightly.

15
00:00:42,635 --> 00:00:45,978
You'll be in our care for quite
some time, so please be patient.

16
00:00:46,065 --> 00:00:50,063
The fact of the matter is we just don't
know how long you're going to remain here.

17
00:00:52,812 --> 00:00:53,923
Just kidding!

18
00:00:54,016 --> 00:00:54,599
Huh?

19
00:00:54,667 --> 00:00:57,941
It's true your body still needs
time to properly heal itself,

20
00:00:58,365 --> 00:00:59,938
but for some strange reason,

21
00:01:00,006 --> 00:01:04,508
doctors from the Speedwagon foundation
recently contacted us out of the blue,

22
00:01:04,544 --> 00:01:07,220
and they've asked that we
entrust your medical care to them,

23
00:01:07,313 --> 00:01:12,223
though I have little doubt their state-of-the-art
medical treatments will prove to be more than effective.

24
00:01:12,667 --> 00:01:15,800
But tell me, who are you behind that schoolboy facade?

25
00:01:16,095 --> 00:01:19,865
Surely you must know that foundation is world-famous.

26
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:24,086
I can't imagine they'd want anything to
do with an average high school student.

27
00:01:24,137 --> 00:01:28,101
Let's just say I'm fortunate
to have a very dependable friend.

28
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:32,961
Thank you for everything, Mr. Joestar.

29
00:01:33,909 --> 00:01:37,091
I suppose we'll be seeing each
other again sooner than we thought.

30
00:01:37,778 --> 00:01:41,712
Jotaro, Polnareff, Avdol, Iggy,

31
00:01:42,322 --> 00:01:43,577
just hang in there.

32
00:03:23,213 --> 00:03:26,351
Located in Southern Egypt is the city of Luxor.

33
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:29,398
To the ancient Egyptians, however,

34
00:03:29,471 --> 00:03:31,230
it was the site of Thebes,

35
00:03:31,715 --> 00:03:34,996
and it is in this location, on the west bank of the Nile,

36
00:03:35,085 --> 00:03:37,599
that the pharaohs of old were laid to rest.

37
00:03:38,673 --> 00:03:41,401
It is known as the valley of the kings.

38
00:03:42,232 --> 00:03:45,271
Have you heard of the tomb of the great king Tutankhamen?

39
00:03:45,302 --> 00:03:47,771
It lies here in the valley of the kings.

40
00:03:47,957 --> 00:03:50,401
Wow, this place is chock full of history.

41
00:03:51,063 --> 00:03:52,496
If what I've heard is true,

42
00:03:52,575 --> 00:03:56,779
some of the residents of this area still
dig beneath their houses in search of treasure

43
00:03:56,804 --> 00:03:58,646
without permission from the government.

44
00:03:59,002 --> 00:04:02,513
Think those ancient guys left
behind any undiscovered treasure?

45
00:04:02,699 --> 00:04:04,015
Perhaps they did.

46
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:07,578
You guys see where the old man ran off to?

47
00:04:08,125 --> 00:04:12,463
Oh, yes. To the bathroom, and he
took Iggy, since he can detect enemies.

48
00:04:12,502 --> 00:04:13,539
Is that so?

49
00:04:13,764 --> 00:04:14,886
Do you need to go?

50
00:04:14,971 --> 00:04:16,043
Hmm.

51
00:04:16,767 --> 00:04:19,069
I might, if it's a normal bathroom.

52
00:04:25,782 --> 00:04:28,852
Oh, my god!

53
00:04:32,088 --> 00:04:34,553
The climate in this place is so damn arid,

54
00:04:34,624 --> 00:04:37,479
the crap dries up, turns to dust, and blows away.

55
00:04:37,674 --> 00:04:41,463
Which means instead of using water,
this toilet relies solely on wind.

56
00:04:41,571 --> 00:04:43,524
And I don't see any toilet paper.

57
00:04:43,894 --> 00:04:45,701
Hmm? Is that...

58
00:04:49,979 --> 00:04:53,372
Exactly as I thought. Some sort of sand basin.

59
00:04:53,537 --> 00:04:55,127
So you wipe your ass...

60
00:04:55,158 --> 00:04:56,178
With sand?!

61
00:04:56,752 --> 00:04:59,539
Desert sand is as sterile as it gets.

62
00:04:59,682 --> 00:05:02,650
Oh, my god!

63
00:05:05,341 --> 00:05:08,819
I think I'll pull a Polnareff and
wait 'til we get back to the hotel.

64
00:05:09,006 --> 00:05:11,411
What's the point of a shack if you're going in a hole?

65
00:05:11,495 --> 00:05:14,226
You might as well just do your business behind a rock.

66
00:05:14,291 --> 00:05:17,168
This thing is weird, even for a place like Egypt.

67
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:18,300
Huh?

68
00:05:25,268 --> 00:05:28,280
Eh? Eh? Eh?

69
00:05:28,906 --> 00:05:29,582
Hmm.

70
00:05:29,886 --> 00:05:32,222
This doesn't make the slightest bit of sense.

71
00:05:32,569 --> 00:05:36,379
Who in their right mind would think
to put an electrical outlet in a rock?

72
00:05:36,767 --> 00:05:38,632
I wonder what it's used for.

73
00:05:39,155 --> 00:05:41,205
There's no electricity out here.

74
00:05:46,583 --> 00:05:48,889
The damn thing electrocuted me!

75
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:50,975
Mr. Joestar, is everything all right?

76
00:05:51,115 --> 00:05:52,830
We should probably get a move on.

77
00:05:53,574 --> 00:05:55,536
Huh? Oh, right.

78
00:05:56,366 --> 00:05:57,880
Just give me a second.

79
00:05:59,687 --> 00:06:01,929
That scared the living daylights out of me.

80
00:06:02,473 --> 00:06:04,426
I can't believe it's still live.

81
00:06:04,535 --> 00:06:07,260
I guess the cables must run underground or something.

82
00:06:07,924 --> 00:06:11,922
You can never tell with this place.
It's like traveling through a fantasy-land.

83
00:06:27,288 --> 00:06:29,041
Card of the goddess Bast.

84
00:06:29,221 --> 00:06:31,287
Stand user: Mariah.

85
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:38,956
Now how did that old saying go again?

86
00:06:39,469 --> 00:06:41,571
Curiosity killed the cat?

87
00:06:55,259 --> 00:06:57,742
We could make it to Cairo in two days,

88
00:06:57,795 --> 00:07:00,498
but since all of us are injured and exhausted,

89
00:07:00,615 --> 00:07:04,561
why don't we spend tonight and tomorrow
in Luxor and use that time to recuperate?

90
00:07:04,641 --> 00:07:06,338
Hmm. Hmm.

91
00:07:06,897 --> 00:07:08,119
Sounds good to me.

92
00:07:08,326 --> 00:07:09,972
Ever since we got to Egypt,

93
00:07:10,059 --> 00:07:12,931
the enemy stands have been getting stronger and stronger.

94
00:07:13,256 --> 00:07:16,024
We've been winning these battles by the skin of our teeth.

95
00:07:16,185 --> 00:07:16,946
Hmm.

96
00:07:17,609 --> 00:07:20,283
Hey, Mr. Joestar, is something wrong?

97
00:07:20,308 --> 00:07:21,127
I'm fine.

98
00:07:21,152 --> 00:07:23,467
My prosthetic hand is acting funny. That's all.

99
00:07:23,947 --> 00:07:27,175
It's nothing to worry about. I
probably just need to oil the joints.

100
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:31,375
Hey, there! Shopkeeper! Can you please
do something about that radio? It's busted.

101
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,735
Man, that's peculiar.

102
00:07:33,041 --> 00:07:35,740
It was made in Japan, and I just bought the darn thing.

103
00:07:36,406 --> 00:07:38,882
Well, it's just static now! Turn it off!

104
00:07:39,636 --> 00:07:40,301
Huh?

105
00:07:41,136 --> 00:07:42,229
Mr. Joestar?

106
00:07:42,338 --> 00:07:44,647
Hmm? Yeah, you're right.

107
00:07:45,008 --> 00:07:48,849
It'd probably be in our best interest
to rest up before heading to Cairo.

108
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:52,480
Remember, we can't let our guard down.

109
00:07:53,663 --> 00:07:55,490
Okay, let's find a hotel.

110
00:07:56,712 --> 00:07:58,012
What's going on?

111
00:07:58,555 --> 00:08:00,069
Thanks for the drinks, mister.

112
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:01,315
Uh, come again!

113
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,172
Hey, look at that.

114
00:08:26,197 --> 00:08:27,740
The radio's working again.

115
00:08:37,417 --> 00:08:38,231
What the...

116
00:08:38,402 --> 00:08:40,337
Why's the hammer suddenly so heavy?

117
00:08:40,362 --> 00:08:42,471
I can't... huh?

118
00:08:45,395 --> 00:08:46,795
What the hell?

119
00:08:53,836 --> 00:08:54,570
Hmm?

120
00:08:55,559 --> 00:08:57,092
Th-the nails!

121
00:08:57,206 --> 00:08:59,633
Ohh! Oh, god, it hurts!

122
00:08:59,662 --> 00:09:02,318
Hey, old man, did you bang your finger with the hammer?

123
00:09:02,343 --> 00:09:03,766
You gotta be more careful.

124
00:09:03,791 --> 00:09:07,062
You can't just go throwing hammers around. It's dangerous.

125
00:09:07,802 --> 00:09:08,697
Jeez.

126
00:09:14,017 --> 00:09:16,259
Mr. Joestar, it's time to wake up.

127
00:09:17,108 --> 00:09:18,572
Mr. Joestar.

128
00:09:18,597 --> 00:09:20,407
Hey, hurry it up in there!

129
00:09:22,132 --> 00:09:26,301
Polnareff is going on and on about the
four of us finding somewhere to eat breakfast.

130
00:09:26,326 --> 00:09:28,247
Hurry, and wake him up, Avdol!

131
00:09:28,338 --> 00:09:30,653
He's got five minutes before I come up there!

132
00:09:30,678 --> 00:09:33,852
You know, I thought old people
were supposed to get up early!

133
00:09:35,605 --> 00:09:37,038
Damn smart aleck.

134
00:09:37,132 --> 00:09:39,126
He has no respect for his elders.

135
00:09:39,575 --> 00:09:41,811
Tell him I'll be down in just a minute.

136
00:09:42,218 --> 00:09:42,880
Right.

137
00:09:44,401 --> 00:09:47,292
Well, that's bizarre. Why did my watch stop working?

138
00:09:48,172 --> 00:09:49,914
You know, Mr. Joestar...

139
00:09:50,267 --> 00:09:50,934
Hmm?

140
00:09:51,168 --> 00:09:54,570
You toss and turn in your sleep
quite a bit for a man your age.

141
00:09:54,595 --> 00:09:57,458
You haven't noticed yet, but you're facing the wrong way.

142
00:09:59,069 --> 00:10:02,576
You went to bed facing south, but
woke up northward like a compass.

143
00:10:02,601 --> 00:10:04,489
Glad you still have a youthful spirit.

144
00:10:05,082 --> 00:10:06,948
I'll be downstairs when you're ready.

145
00:10:07,284 --> 00:10:07,897
Hmm?

146
00:10:14,375 --> 00:10:15,690
Hmm.

147
00:10:16,573 --> 00:10:19,689
Something strange has been going
on ever since yesterday afternoon,

148
00:10:19,714 --> 00:10:22,373
and for some reason, my hand is still acting up.

149
00:10:24,942 --> 00:10:25,521
Hmm?

150
00:10:27,384 --> 00:10:27,886
Huh?

151
00:10:28,831 --> 00:10:29,468
Hmm?

152
00:10:41,418 --> 00:10:43,289
What is up with this freaky chair?

153
00:10:43,447 --> 00:10:45,426
The blasted thing's moving on its own.

154
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:50,566
If I didn't know any better, I'd guess
the floors in this place were slanted.

155
00:10:50,999 --> 00:10:55,058
For such a ritzy hotel,
it sure does seem like it was cheaply made.

156
00:10:58,108 --> 00:10:59,374
So where should we go today?

157
00:10:59,457 --> 00:11:03,627
Well, I had an amazing time looking
around Karnak, so I'd say something like that.

158
00:11:03,652 --> 00:11:03,904
Mm.

159
00:11:03,929 --> 00:11:06,398
How about the valley of the queens, instead?

160
00:11:09,436 --> 00:11:13,618
What the hell do you think you're
doing, you old pervert?! Jackass!

161
00:11:14,706 --> 00:11:17,468
I don't understand. What the hell just happened?

162
00:11:25,495 --> 00:11:27,046
Ooh!

163
00:11:32,102 --> 00:11:37,606
I do appreciate your forwardness, but you need
to work on your approach, you naughty, naughty man.

164
00:11:39,012 --> 00:11:43,333
But that said, you're just my t-y-p-e.

165
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:44,381
Mwah.

166
00:11:44,707 --> 00:11:47,829
Oh, my god!

167
00:11:49,004 --> 00:11:49,920
I was right!

168
00:11:49,945 --> 00:11:54,430
Something's wrong here, really wrong, and
it's been this way ever since yesterday afternoon!

169
00:11:55,912 --> 00:11:57,316
Ahh!

170
00:11:57,641 --> 00:11:58,961
Wait. What the...

171
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:01,499
Th-they're stuck to my hand!

172
00:12:01,947 --> 00:12:04,224
Hang on. It's all starting to make sense,

173
00:12:04,535 --> 00:12:08,106
the reason why all these metal
objects are suddenly attracted to me.

174
00:12:08,632 --> 00:12:11,223
But it can't be. That's impossible.

175
00:12:13,384 --> 00:12:14,764
Yaah!

176
00:12:15,106 --> 00:12:16,283
It looks like I was right!

177
00:12:16,773 --> 00:12:19,005
My body's turned into a magnet!

178
00:12:29,173 --> 00:12:32,129
I think this insanity might be the work of a stand.

179
00:12:32,463 --> 00:12:34,918
But if that's the case, why can't I see it?

180
00:12:35,362 --> 00:12:39,121
How could these knives and forks
fly at me if the stand isn't nearby?

181
00:12:42,332 --> 00:12:43,741
There's no way.

182
00:12:44,279 --> 00:12:49,236
Could this really be a side effect of the shock
I took from the socket on that rock yesterday?

183
00:12:49,776 --> 00:12:50,431
Hmm?

184
00:12:53,083 --> 00:12:54,596
I can't get out of it.

185
00:12:55,083 --> 00:12:59,326
Oh, no. It didn't even cross my mind
that the escalator's made of steel.

186
00:12:59,442 --> 00:13:00,826
This doesn't look good.

187
00:13:01,258 --> 00:13:03,967
The magnetic pull's getting stronger by the minute.

188
00:13:05,542 --> 00:13:06,233
Hmm?

189
00:13:12,105 --> 00:13:13,198
How the...

190
00:13:13,649 --> 00:13:17,237
You there, lady in the micro-miniskirt!
I need you to help me out!

191
00:13:17,262 --> 00:13:18,917
Please, miss, I'm beggin' you!

192
00:13:19,061 --> 00:13:21,530
Not to be rude, but your chain's wrapped around my body,

193
00:13:21,555 --> 00:13:24,818
and it'd be nice if you'd get it
off me before I'm shredded to pieces!

194
00:13:24,981 --> 00:13:29,028
There's not much time, so if you could push
the emergency stop button, that'd be swell!

195
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:30,842
Come on, lady!

196
00:13:30,914 --> 00:13:32,455
The chains are pulling me tighter!

197
00:13:32,489 --> 00:13:34,595
This thing's gonna rip off my hands and feet!

198
00:13:36,105 --> 00:13:37,440
What's the problem?!

199
00:13:37,546 --> 00:13:39,078
Are you even listening?!

200
00:13:42,699 --> 00:13:43,936
Hmm?

201
00:13:46,408 --> 00:13:49,782
Enjoy the ride, Joseph Joestar.

202
00:13:49,813 --> 00:13:50,856
What the hell?!

203
00:13:50,881 --> 00:13:52,365
You can't be serious!

204
00:13:52,596 --> 00:13:54,064
If you know who I am,

205
00:13:55,257 --> 00:13:57,754
that would make you the stand user!

206
00:14:06,329 --> 00:14:08,942
So it's you, damn it all.

207
00:14:09,002 --> 00:14:11,333
You were the stand user all along!

208
00:14:12,761 --> 00:14:17,984
Once you've made contact with the
magnetic field surrounding my stand, Bast,

209
00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:22,294
you've sealed your fate, as there's
no escape from its deadly power.

210
00:14:27,830 --> 00:14:29,427
Please, let me out!

211
00:14:29,878 --> 00:14:32,466
Someone stop this infernal escalator!

212
00:14:33,817 --> 00:14:34,963
Hey, that's it!

213
00:14:35,249 --> 00:14:37,183
I'll push the emergency stop button

214
00:14:37,345 --> 00:14:38,907
using my hermit purple!

215
00:14:43,837 --> 00:14:46,019
That doesn't make sense! Where is it?!

216
00:14:46,186 --> 00:14:50,542
The only reason that I'd have this much
trouble finding it would be if it didn't have one,

217
00:14:50,566 --> 00:14:52,174
but that can't be possible!

218
00:14:52,241 --> 00:14:54,709
What escalator doesn't have a shut-off button?!

219
00:14:59,809 --> 00:15:02,324
It's pulling me in!

220
00:15:03,536 --> 00:15:07,107
Yah! My neck! My neck!

221
00:15:07,133 --> 00:15:07,774
Hmm.

222
00:15:09,187 --> 00:15:11,295
It's gonna cut off my head!

223
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,859
I'm done for!

224
00:15:13,077 --> 00:15:13,572
Hmph.

225
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:16,706
Save me!

226
00:15:16,731 --> 00:15:18,264
Mr. Joestar, pay attention.

227
00:15:18,289 --> 00:15:20,193
I'm gonna die!

228
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:22,439
Hello! Mr. Joestar!

229
00:15:22,559 --> 00:15:25,366
Why decapitation?!

230
00:15:25,495 --> 00:15:28,306
Goodbye, cruel wor... uhh?

231
00:15:34,592 --> 00:15:36,654
The escalator stopped some time ago.

232
00:15:36,734 --> 00:15:39,084
I already pushed the emergency stop button.

233
00:15:39,264 --> 00:15:41,475
It's on the side instead of in the front.

234
00:15:41,548 --> 00:15:43,989
Uh, everything is a-okay!

235
00:15:44,115 --> 00:15:47,419
I just inspected this escalator,
and it's in working order!

236
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:50,413
You'll be happy to know the emergency button works fine!

237
00:15:50,556 --> 00:15:54,104
Hello, sir. You must be the owner of this establishment.

238
00:15:54,916 --> 00:15:58,424
If you don't mind, I'll be
needing your signature right here.

239
00:15:58,668 --> 00:15:59,337
Hmm?

240
00:15:59,465 --> 00:16:01,334
I'm lost, Mr. Joestar.

241
00:16:01,501 --> 00:16:02,539
What happened?

242
00:16:03,134 --> 00:16:04,200
A stand.

243
00:16:04,316 --> 00:16:06,819
An enemy stand managed to tag me yesterday.

244
00:16:06,978 --> 00:16:09,518
Now my body's turned into one big magnet.

245
00:16:12,714 --> 00:16:13,287
Hmm?

246
00:16:13,332 --> 00:16:15,786
You see? The user turned me into a magnet,

247
00:16:15,811 --> 00:16:17,606
and now metal is attracted to me.

248
00:16:17,676 --> 00:16:19,141
Would you pull this thing off of me?

249
00:16:19,172 --> 00:16:24,470
It looks like the magnetic pull is becoming
stronger the longer the stand's power remains in effect.

250
00:16:24,494 --> 00:16:25,028
Huh?

251
00:16:28,893 --> 00:16:29,693
That's her!

252
00:16:29,718 --> 00:16:31,516
That woman there is the stand user!

253
00:16:31,631 --> 00:16:33,466
We've gotta find a way to stop her!

254
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:36,323
And I have to get rid of this
insane magnetic pull somehow,

255
00:16:36,402 --> 00:16:38,501
or I won't be able to move my body at all!

256
00:16:38,684 --> 00:16:40,890
We should also get Jotaro and Polnareff!

257
00:16:41,382 --> 00:16:42,610
Uh, what?!

258
00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:45,640
It's so heavy!

259
00:16:45,665 --> 00:16:46,565
Not again!

260
00:16:46,738 --> 00:16:49,100
Avdol, there's no time to get the others!

261
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:50,738
Just look! She's getting away!

262
00:16:52,858 --> 00:16:54,566
Move away, Mr. Joestar!

263
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:55,664
Just run after her!

264
00:16:55,689 --> 00:16:56,719
Right! On it!

265
00:16:57,409 --> 00:16:59,689
I have to get a good look at her face.

266
00:17:03,156 --> 00:17:04,477
But this is...

267
00:17:05,910 --> 00:17:08,944
Clever. She went into the ladies' room. Now what?

268
00:17:09,902 --> 00:17:11,526
Mm...

269
00:17:13,796 --> 00:17:15,275
Guess I'm going in.

270
00:17:15,898 --> 00:17:17,533
My life is on the line here,

271
00:17:17,652 --> 00:17:20,332
so I guess I have to catch this Vixen no matter what.

272
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:29,800
What's the holdup?

273
00:17:32,093 --> 00:17:33,693
That's what I'd like to know.

274
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:37,720
Avdol went inside to find him,
but he hasn't come back either.

275
00:17:39,111 --> 00:17:39,964
Oh, no!

276
00:17:40,206 --> 00:17:41,943
What if those two snuck off?

277
00:17:42,008 --> 00:17:42,536
What?

278
00:17:43,569 --> 00:17:46,835
They're probably having an amazing breakfast as we speak!

279
00:17:48,701 --> 00:17:51,449
It's more likely he's taking his time in the bathroom,

280
00:17:51,829 --> 00:17:55,220
but if they don't show up in the next
five minutes, we'll go look for 'em.

281
00:17:55,656 --> 00:17:57,480
Yeah, the bathroom.

282
00:17:57,717 --> 00:17:59,163
Guess that makes sense.

283
00:17:59,804 --> 00:18:04,026
You know, come to think of it, the
bathrooms in this hotel are spotless.

284
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:10,891
So, Mr. Joestar, now that we're in here...

285
00:18:16,951 --> 00:18:18,585
It's just as I expected.

286
00:18:18,746 --> 00:18:20,466
We have a problem on our hands.

287
00:18:21,625 --> 00:18:22,460
Shh.

288
00:18:22,985 --> 00:18:24,845
Forgive me, but I...

289
00:18:24,952 --> 00:18:27,513
I haven't the foggiest clue which stall she's in.

290
00:18:27,618 --> 00:18:29,219
Do you have a way to find her?

291
00:18:30,046 --> 00:18:32,269
Well, for one, she's got amazing legs.

292
00:18:32,307 --> 00:18:33,516
Her legs?

293
00:18:33,547 --> 00:18:34,293
That's right.

294
00:18:34,333 --> 00:18:35,597
Just look for those legs.

295
00:18:35,631 --> 00:18:37,670
Believe me when I say you can't miss 'em.

296
00:18:37,864 --> 00:18:40,459
So we have to take a peek?

297
00:18:50,811 --> 00:18:52,645
No, she's not in this one.

298
00:18:53,739 --> 00:18:54,305
Nope.

299
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:56,134
No again.

300
00:19:05,084 --> 00:19:07,412
Mr. Joestar, I think I found her.

301
00:19:07,732 --> 00:19:09,927
Come over here. Are these her legs?

302
00:19:17,794 --> 00:19:19,095
Eh? Huh?

303
00:19:39,276 --> 00:19:42,806
Oh, my. You're that handsome fellow from before.

304
00:19:42,969 --> 00:19:45,117
You came all the way here to find me?

305
00:19:45,297 --> 00:19:48,536
You dirty boy, the heart wants what the heart wants.

306
00:19:48,561 --> 00:19:49,458
Mwah!

307
00:19:50,071 --> 00:19:51,099
Holy shit!

308
00:19:51,296 --> 00:19:53,681
It's... it's the hag from earlier,

309
00:19:53,706 --> 00:19:55,108
from the second floor!

310
00:19:55,427 --> 00:19:57,981
This is bad! We got the wrong person!

311
00:19:58,174 --> 00:20:00,740
But I thought for sure those
were the legs of the stand user!

312
00:20:00,773 --> 00:20:02,179
How could you screw that up?!

313
00:20:02,419 --> 00:20:03,381
Run, Avdol!

314
00:20:03,405 --> 00:20:03,759
What?!

315
00:20:05,354 --> 00:20:07,229
Pervs!

316
00:20:09,914 --> 00:20:12,413
I don't deserve to be treated like a peeping Tom!

317
00:20:12,438 --> 00:20:14,926
Polnareff's the one who should
be getting called a dirty pervert!

318
00:20:14,972 --> 00:20:16,026
Dirty old man!

319
00:20:16,051 --> 00:20:17,320
Disgusting!

320
00:20:17,345 --> 00:20:18,497
Perverts!

321
00:20:18,731 --> 00:20:21,511
Oh, no! He's scrumptious.

322
00:20:24,488 --> 00:20:26,861
Look, there she is! She's headed that way!

323
00:20:26,905 --> 00:20:27,589
Damn it!

324
00:20:27,733 --> 00:20:29,757
How did that harlot get so far away?!

325
00:20:29,817 --> 00:20:30,783
After her!

326
00:20:32,684 --> 00:20:33,987
I forgot to tell you.

327
00:20:34,011 --> 00:20:38,011
Whatever you do, it's imperative that you
refrain from touching any electrical outlets!

328
00:20:38,206 --> 00:20:39,720
It doesn't matter where they are!

329
00:20:39,871 --> 00:20:41,119
Stay away from them!

330
00:20:41,574 --> 00:20:43,691
She manifests her stand through the outlets!

331
00:20:43,716 --> 00:20:47,564
The moment you touch one, you'll get zapped,
and the magnetism will begin to take effect!

332
00:20:48,021 --> 00:20:51,343
Eh? I'm afraid I already did, Mr. Joestar.

333
00:20:51,377 --> 00:20:53,666
What?! Where did it happen?!

334
00:20:53,973 --> 00:20:57,528
I touched one when I pushed the
emergency stop button on the escalator.

335
00:20:57,801 --> 00:20:59,765
There was a socket directly beside it.

336
00:20:59,790 --> 00:21:01,342
If only I had known!

337
00:21:02,056 --> 00:21:03,969
Damn! That conniving minx.

338
00:21:04,176 --> 00:21:05,956
Excuse me, Mr. Joestar.

339
00:21:05,999 --> 00:21:07,767
Would you mind giving me some space?

340
00:21:07,799 --> 00:21:09,933
I can't run with you stuck to me like this!

341
00:21:10,079 --> 00:21:12,401
I was about to say the same to you, Avdol!

342
00:21:12,426 --> 00:21:14,083
What are you talking about, sir?

343
00:21:14,108 --> 00:21:16,056
You're the one who's running close to me!

344
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:20,208
If what I know about magnets is true,

345
00:21:20,290 --> 00:21:22,483
we're being forced together!

346
00:21:25,647 --> 00:21:29,328
I cannot believe she managed
to turn me into a magnet as well.

347
00:21:29,549 --> 00:21:32,972
Mr. Joestar, I really hate saying this, but...

348
00:21:33,078 --> 00:21:33,960
Yeah, I know!

349
00:21:33,985 --> 00:21:36,573
We've gotten ourselves into a world of trouble.

350
00:21:38,404 --> 00:21:40,064
This is ridiculous!

351
00:21:40,971 --> 00:21:42,799
I'm at a complete loss.

352
00:21:45,745 --> 00:21:47,660
She's so powerful!
