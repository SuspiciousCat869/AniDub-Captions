1
00:01:38,902 --> 00:01:43,122
[Sanzo] Our journey
West has been halted,
as the Prince of War begins

2
00:01:43,122 --> 00:01:46,722
to implement his plan to create
a new Heaven and Earth.

3
00:01:49,689 --> 00:01:53,656
Meanwhile, we have crashed
into Homura's stronghold,

4
00:01:53,756 --> 00:01:57,789
intent on reclaiming the
Maten Scripture that
was stolen from us.

5
00:01:59,589 --> 00:02:04,489
Then, in a desperate effort
to hold back an immortal
army of demons,

6
00:02:04,589 --> 00:02:08,189
Hakkai is forced to remove
his demon power limiter.

7
00:02:20,889 --> 00:02:22,756
[Gojyo] "My soul to keep."

8
00:02:29,489 --> 00:02:34,722
[God 1] There is absolutely
no doubt this is a clear
act of treason!

9
00:02:34,856 --> 00:02:37,822
But what do you suppose
we do about it? Well?

10
00:02:37,922 --> 00:02:40,622
We can't stand for this
kind of treachery!

11
00:02:40,722 --> 00:02:44,422
[God 3] I personally think
he should be should be stripped
of the title of War Prince.

12
00:02:44,522 --> 00:02:48,589
Let us find a god capable
of defeating Homura,
to take the job.

13
00:02:48,689 --> 00:02:50,222
All in favor?

14
00:02:50,322 --> 00:02:51,456
[Gods] Aye!

15
00:02:54,022 --> 00:02:57,056
[Goddess] I will admit that
removing Homura is all
well and good,

16
00:02:57,156 --> 00:02:59,722
but who do you expect
to take his place?

17
00:02:59,822 --> 00:03:01,722
Oh great, now you've done it.

18
00:03:01,822 --> 00:03:03,022
[God 1] Well, u-uh...

19
00:03:03,122 --> 00:03:05,589
Shut up. Nataku is a vegetable.

20
00:03:05,689 --> 00:03:08,956
And since he's no use to you,
who exactly do you have in mind?

21
00:03:09,056 --> 00:03:12,656
[God 2] Well, surely you don't
suggest we sit back and watch?

22
00:03:12,756 --> 00:03:15,089
That is exactly what
I'm suggesting.

23
00:03:15,189 --> 00:03:16,489
Why do you do this to me?

24
00:03:16,589 --> 00:03:18,789
That is completely insane.

25
00:03:18,889 --> 00:03:21,422
Oh, please. You'd
just screw things up.

26
00:03:22,722 --> 00:03:24,689
A god's duty...

27
00:03:24,789 --> 00:03:29,322
is to be an audience
to the show below.
[chuckles]

28
00:03:44,289 --> 00:03:45,622
We're done here.

29
00:03:53,389 --> 00:03:55,022
Shall we get started then?

30
00:03:55,856 --> 00:03:56,989
[Gairu] You're a...

31
00:03:59,156 --> 00:04:00,289
[Hakkai yells]

32
00:04:01,756 --> 00:04:03,889
[Pained grunting]

33
00:04:06,789 --> 00:04:10,489
[Hakkai yells]

34
00:04:13,956 --> 00:04:15,089
[Yelling]

35
00:04:18,156 --> 00:04:19,289
Huh?

36
00:04:20,722 --> 00:04:21,856
[Goku gasps]

37
00:04:26,922 --> 00:04:28,756
It's beautiful!

38
00:04:30,256 --> 00:04:32,089
It's obviously a trap.

39
00:04:32,189 --> 00:04:35,256
[Gojyo sighs]
Can you even try to
use that brain of yours?

40
00:04:35,356 --> 00:04:38,256
This four-star dinner doesn't
even make you suspicious?

41
00:04:38,356 --> 00:04:40,422
[Goku] I don't question
free food, man.

42
00:04:41,356 --> 00:04:43,489
We're not going to fall for it!

43
00:04:49,089 --> 00:04:51,956
Don't worry. The food's
not poisoned, I promise.

44
00:04:52,056 --> 00:04:56,656
Homura thought you fine
gentlemen might enjoy one
last meal before you die.

45
00:04:56,756 --> 00:04:59,789
Oh my, that's awfully
kind of him.

46
00:04:59,889 --> 00:05:01,356
Send him my regrets.

47
00:05:04,122 --> 00:05:05,422
Shit, they're gods.

48
00:05:07,189 --> 00:05:09,622
[Sanzo] I really
hate these guys.

49
00:05:09,722 --> 00:05:13,156
[Bodyguard 2] We are Lord
Homura's personal entourage.

50
00:05:13,256 --> 00:05:16,622
[Bodyguard 3] We go where
he goes, even if it
cost us our lives.

51
00:05:16,722 --> 00:05:21,889
[Bodyguard 4] Or leads us
down to this Hell hole,
as the case may be.

52
00:05:21,989 --> 00:05:26,456
[Gojyo] How very loyal of you.
Though that sort of thing never
really did impress me much.

53
00:05:26,556 --> 00:05:30,956
[Bodyguard 5] Surely you
can see Homura is a man
worthy of our devotion.

54
00:05:31,056 --> 00:05:33,989
[Bodyguard 1] Sit, and have
a drink with us. Who knows,

55
00:05:34,089 --> 00:05:37,422
you may find our cause is
not so disagreeable after all.

56
00:05:41,289 --> 00:05:42,422
Gojyo!

57
00:05:49,622 --> 00:05:52,589
Auuugh! I just knew
you were gonna do that!

58
00:05:52,689 --> 00:05:54,556
You coulda spared the meatbuns!

59
00:05:56,856 --> 00:05:59,289
[Gojyo] I really
hate guys like you.

60
00:05:59,389 --> 00:06:03,389
So willing to lay down your
lives at the order of some
self-serving despot,

61
00:06:03,489 --> 00:06:07,356
yet completely unable to life a
finger to stand up for yourself.

62
00:06:07,456 --> 00:06:10,089
[Bodyguard 1] Hmph. Is that so?

63
00:06:10,189 --> 00:06:12,656
You know, you coulda
hurt me, you jerk!

64
00:06:12,756 --> 00:06:15,522
Then maybe you should
just give me some room.

65
00:06:15,622 --> 00:06:17,722
You're just getting
in the way here.

66
00:06:17,822 --> 00:06:19,722
[Goku growls]
[Sanzo] Let's go, Goku!

67
00:06:21,022 --> 00:06:22,156
[Hakuryu squeaks]

68
00:06:22,856 --> 00:06:24,922
But... I just...

69
00:06:25,022 --> 00:06:28,256
[Gojyo] This won't be pretty,
and you know how vain I am.

70
00:06:31,589 --> 00:06:35,422
Don't expect me to chant any
sutras for you if you croak.

71
00:06:35,522 --> 00:06:40,789
Yes, Sir. I'd sure hate
for you to have to put
yourself out or anything.

72
00:06:42,089 --> 00:06:44,256
I guess we'll just go then.

73
00:06:44,356 --> 00:06:45,589
Stop right there!

74
00:06:45,689 --> 00:06:46,889
[Bodyguard 2 gasps]

75
00:06:49,222 --> 00:06:53,856
Sorry to disappoint you,
gentlemen, but you'll
be fighting me today.

76
00:06:53,956 --> 00:06:59,289
Oh, please. What can a measly
demon do against gods
such as us?

77
00:06:59,389 --> 00:07:03,689
It looks to me like...
these guys are going down.

78
00:07:03,789 --> 00:07:08,556
I don't know much about gods,
but I do know who I hate.

79
00:07:08,656 --> 00:07:09,889
And that's you.

80
00:07:25,989 --> 00:07:28,389
The first stage is now complete.

81
00:07:28,489 --> 00:07:31,056
It's time to move to stage two.

82
00:07:31,156 --> 00:07:34,256
[Zenon] So, do I have to
keep standing here or what?

83
00:07:34,389 --> 00:07:36,122
[Shien] You're free to move now.

84
00:07:36,222 --> 00:07:39,122
And these scriptures have
served their purpose well.

85
00:07:39,222 --> 00:07:40,356
All right.

86
00:07:41,556 --> 00:07:43,522
I've got a kink.

87
00:07:43,622 --> 00:07:47,156
Next time, can we do some
jumping jacks or something?

88
00:07:47,256 --> 00:07:49,656
[Shien] Things appear
to be going on schedule.

89
00:07:49,756 --> 00:07:54,656
The energy to generate
a new Heaven and Earth is
coalescing outside the tower.

90
00:07:54,756 --> 00:07:58,422
All we need now is the key to
open the door to the new world.

91
00:07:58,522 --> 00:08:01,156
[Homura] Our precious
little monkey.
[Shien] Indeed.

92
00:08:01,256 --> 00:08:04,189
Then I guess we'll just have
to get him, now won't we?

93
00:08:06,156 --> 00:08:07,289
[Homura] Right.

94
00:08:11,389 --> 00:08:13,789
I.... Impossible!

95
00:08:13,889 --> 00:08:17,222
You're just a measly,
half-breed demon!

96
00:08:17,956 --> 00:08:19,089
[Bodyguard 3 yells]

97
00:08:22,422 --> 00:08:23,689
All right!

98
00:08:23,789 --> 00:08:26,122
Which one of you
wants to go next?

99
00:08:26,222 --> 00:08:29,456
Can't be! This creature
is no ordinary demon!

100
00:08:29,556 --> 00:08:31,789
That technique...
There's only one person

101
00:08:31,889 --> 00:08:34,689
in the Heavens I know who could
fight like that, but he's...

102
00:08:34,789 --> 00:08:35,989
[Bodyguard 2 gasps]

103
00:08:47,689 --> 00:08:49,156
[All gasp]

104
00:08:49,256 --> 00:08:50,989
You can't be...

105
00:08:51,089 --> 00:08:52,356
It's not possible...

106
00:09:08,643 --> 00:09:10,884
[Gojyo] Come on, come on!

107
00:09:10,884 --> 00:09:15,084
You bunch of little god-babies
move like you learned to
fight in the playground.

108
00:09:16,017 --> 00:09:17,150
[Gods yell]

109
00:09:22,484 --> 00:09:23,617
[Gods yell]

110
00:09:37,017 --> 00:09:39,284
[God grunts, then yells]

111
00:09:47,517 --> 00:09:48,984
[Bodyguard 1] Y-you...

112
00:09:49,084 --> 00:09:50,817
are Kenren.

113
00:09:50,917 --> 00:09:52,050
[Gojyo] What?

114
00:09:53,617 --> 00:09:56,084
Who the hell is Kenren?

115
00:09:56,184 --> 00:09:58,050
[Door opens]
[Gojyo] Huh?

116
00:09:58,150 --> 00:10:00,184
[Hakkai] Oh, dear...

117
00:10:00,284 --> 00:10:02,784
Don't tell me it's over already?

118
00:10:02,884 --> 00:10:04,617
'Fraid so. You're late.

119
00:10:05,517 --> 00:10:07,850
[Hakkai] It would appear so.

120
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:08,784
Ah!

121
00:10:08,884 --> 00:10:10,684
[Gojyo] Hey, now.
Are you alright?

122
00:10:12,484 --> 00:10:13,450
I'm fine.

123
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:16,750
I'm afraid it's just
been so long since-ah!

124
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:18,084
GOJYO!

125
00:10:18,184 --> 00:10:19,317
What the-?!

126
00:10:20,417 --> 00:10:21,817
You may have beaten me,

127
00:10:21,917 --> 00:10:24,284
but I still won't
let you pass by.

128
00:10:24,417 --> 00:10:28,150
Let's see... if you're strong
enough to resist...

129
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:30,117
the Curse of Konzai!

130
00:10:30,217 --> 00:10:31,617
[Gojyo] Let go of me!

131
00:10:31,717 --> 00:10:32,950
[Bodyguard] It's too late.

132
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:37,584
Killing me won't stop it!
The curse has already been cast.

133
00:10:37,684 --> 00:10:39,784
Nothing can stop that now!

134
00:10:39,884 --> 00:10:44,150
You have just entered a war you
cannot possibly win, general.

135
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:47,484
You will soon see that even
the mightiest warrior's skills

136
00:10:47,584 --> 00:10:51,417
become useless when
battling his own past!

137
00:10:51,517 --> 00:10:52,450
Whatever!

138
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:54,417
I'm not even a general!

139
00:10:57,317 --> 00:10:58,650
[Stepmother] Gojyo...

140
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:01,484
That voice... can it really be?

141
00:11:01,584 --> 00:11:02,717
Huh?!

142
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:07,817
[Stepmother] Gojyo...

143
00:11:11,850 --> 00:11:12,984
Gojyo...

144
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:23,584
Gojyo...

145
00:11:29,484 --> 00:11:30,617
[Gojyo] Mother?

146
00:11:38,584 --> 00:11:40,350
It's gotten awfully quiet.

147
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:43,384
It was until you opened
up your big mouth.

148
00:11:43,484 --> 00:11:45,350
But there's nothing
to do around here!

149
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:48,484
And we haven't been attacked
in forever, f.y.i.

150
00:11:48,584 --> 00:11:51,384
That's a good thing.
Stop and think about it.

151
00:11:51,484 --> 00:11:53,184
What? Mmmm...

152
00:11:53,284 --> 00:11:55,950
You know, I don't know
why I even bother.

153
00:11:56,050 --> 00:11:59,650
Don't keep keeping me in
suspense, just tell me!

154
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:01,217
Well, alright, genius.

155
00:12:01,317 --> 00:12:03,850
If none of Homura's high
paid gophers are around,

156
00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:06,284
that must mean we're
in the inner sanctum.

157
00:12:06,384 --> 00:12:07,650
In other words...

158
00:12:09,584 --> 00:12:11,350
We're exactly where we wanna be.

159
00:12:14,484 --> 00:12:15,584
[Goku] Homura!

160
00:12:15,684 --> 00:12:17,550
[Shien] At last,
they've arrivied.

161
00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:19,250
[Zenon] What brings you here?

162
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:24,150
I was told you might have
something that belongs to
ME laying around here.

163
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:25,950
You mean the Scripture?

164
00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:28,284
My, my, you're a
quick one aren't you?

165
00:12:28,384 --> 00:12:30,717
If you want it, it's yours.

166
00:12:30,817 --> 00:12:33,850
Just give me... Goku in return.

167
00:12:33,950 --> 00:12:35,084
Huh?

168
00:12:42,050 --> 00:12:43,250
[Stepmother] Gojyo...

169
00:12:44,384 --> 00:12:46,417
[Gojyo] Uh... Mother?!

170
00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:51,784
What... are you doing here?

171
00:12:53,850 --> 00:12:54,984
Gojyo!

172
00:12:56,917 --> 00:12:59,184
It's an illusion! Gojyo!

173
00:12:59,284 --> 00:13:02,284
My guess is it's
the curse of Konzai!

174
00:13:02,384 --> 00:13:04,784
Yeah, I know. It's just so...

175
00:13:06,184 --> 00:13:08,850
Real. I remember her...

176
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:37,884
You shut up.

177
00:13:37,984 --> 00:13:39,550
You're just an illusion!

178
00:13:45,484 --> 00:13:46,617
Huh?

179
00:13:50,384 --> 00:13:52,517
<i>[Gojyo] What the</i>
<i>heck is love anyway?</i>

180
00:13:53,217 --> 00:13:54,684
<i>Not that I want it.</i>

181
00:13:55,817 --> 00:13:59,050
<i>Then, Mom was always crying...</i>

182
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:07,150
Look here, Mom.
Look what I got for you.

183
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:10,150
I brought these from the flower
shop. Aren't they pretty?

184
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:13,017
They're red too.
They remind me...

185
00:14:13,117 --> 00:14:14,384
OF BLOOD!

186
00:14:16,984 --> 00:14:18,984
[Kid Gojyo] Ow!
Ow, mom! Stop it!
[Stepmother] You bastard!

187
00:14:19,117 --> 00:14:22,284
[Kid Gojyo] Mom, that hurts!
Ow, stooop!
[Stepmother] Just like the blood
of that despicable woman!

188
00:14:22,384 --> 00:14:23,984
[Stepmother] How could
you be so thoughtless?
[Kid Gojyo expresses pain]

189
00:14:24,084 --> 00:14:26,917
What are you trying
to say to me?!

190
00:14:27,017 --> 00:14:28,784
You thoughtless...

191
00:14:28,884 --> 00:14:31,017
<i>[Gojyo] A love that</i>
<i>I couldn't win...</i>

192
00:14:31,117 --> 00:14:33,450
<i>soon vanished in</i>
<i>a sea of blood.</i>

193
00:14:35,584 --> 00:14:36,750
<i>[Hakkai] Gojyo!</i>

194
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:46,484
[Gojyo] Stop! I didn't mean to!

195
00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:50,284
Please stop it! STOP IT MOTHER!

196
00:14:51,784 --> 00:14:54,817
As I told you before,
that doesn't work on me.

197
00:14:57,050 --> 00:14:58,184
Huh?

198
00:15:01,384 --> 00:15:04,250
But you certainly do
keep me on my toes.

199
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:08,617
[Homura] Whoops.

200
00:15:08,717 --> 00:15:10,950
You need to be kept on a leash.

201
00:15:11,917 --> 00:15:13,050
[Hakuryu squeaks]

202
00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:14,850
You prick!

203
00:15:14,950 --> 00:15:16,250
As for you...

204
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:28,884
Cut that out!

205
00:15:28,984 --> 00:15:31,684
[Zenon] Might wanna take
a look over here, monkey boy.

206
00:15:54,984 --> 00:15:56,384
Staff extend!

207
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:03,017
[Zenon] He's... he's become...

208
00:16:03,117 --> 00:16:05,717
He's become much
stronger than before.

209
00:16:15,366 --> 00:16:16,999
[Homura] That's good.

210
00:16:17,099 --> 00:16:19,799
That strength is
just what I'm after.

211
00:16:26,132 --> 00:16:27,366
[Sanzo] Goku...

212
00:16:34,499 --> 00:16:35,999
You bastards!

213
00:16:36,132 --> 00:16:39,632
[Zenon] Man, we just barely
managed it with all three of us.

214
00:16:39,732 --> 00:16:42,566
[Shien] His powers are
increasing at an alarming rate.

215
00:16:42,666 --> 00:16:45,066
[Homura] You two can
handle it from here.

216
00:16:46,432 --> 00:16:48,366
You stupid monkey! Wake up!

217
00:16:48,466 --> 00:16:49,966
Wake up, damn you!

218
00:16:52,832 --> 00:16:53,899
[Hakuryu squeaks]

219
00:16:53,999 --> 00:16:55,832
You've hurt my feelings.

220
00:16:55,932 --> 00:17:00,332
So you're telling me I'm not
invited to watch you guys
restart creation?

221
00:17:02,432 --> 00:17:06,232
So I guess we should
also tell you our whole
plan while we're at it?

222
00:17:06,332 --> 00:17:11,732
I'm sorry, I feel much safer
keeping you where you won't
cause us any trouble.

223
00:17:11,832 --> 00:17:13,899
You think of us as roaches.

224
00:17:13,999 --> 00:17:17,832
Oh, no. Your whole party
fought with great courage.

225
00:17:17,932 --> 00:17:20,532
And enough to gain
our admiration.

226
00:17:22,999 --> 00:17:24,499
So long, buddy.

227
00:17:40,232 --> 00:17:42,266
Gyumaoh's son returns.

228
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:44,032
What is it you want?

229
00:17:44,132 --> 00:17:46,966
I am tired of losing
all the time.

230
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:51,299
And I have a few outstanding
debts to pay, as I recall.

231
00:17:51,399 --> 00:17:53,399
Little Lirin's here too, buddy!

232
00:17:55,532 --> 00:17:57,899
[Hakkai] Please
fight back, Gojyo!

233
00:17:58,832 --> 00:17:59,966
[Gojyo] I know!

234
00:18:01,832 --> 00:18:02,966
Damn it!

235
00:18:13,499 --> 00:18:15,132
<i>[Hakkai] How is it possible?</i>

236
00:18:15,266 --> 00:18:18,199
<i>Gojyo's mother was just</i>
<i>an ordinary demon.</i>

237
00:18:18,299 --> 00:18:20,866
<i>My attack should have</i>
<i>completely incinerated her.</i>

238
00:18:20,966 --> 00:18:23,066
<i>[Hakkai gasps] Gojyo!</i>

239
00:18:27,032 --> 00:18:30,299
<i>[Gojyo] Because my mother</i>
<i>saw something in me</i>
<i>that made her cry...</i>

240
00:18:30,399 --> 00:18:32,466
<i>The shadow of the man she</i>
<i>loved, perhaps,</i>

241
00:18:32,566 --> 00:18:36,399
<i>or the constant reminder of the</i>
<i>sins of the woman that bore me.</i>

242
00:18:36,499 --> 00:18:38,799
<i>I guess I believed if I died...</i>

243
00:18:38,899 --> 00:18:41,299
<i>then my mom's tears</i>
<i>would die with them.</i>

244
00:18:41,399 --> 00:18:42,799
<i>So I took it...</i>

245
00:18:42,899 --> 00:18:45,999
[Dokugakuji] Are you going to
make me do it again, Gojyo?!

246
00:18:46,099 --> 00:18:47,232
Huh?

247
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:52,199
[Gojyo] Bro?

248
00:18:52,299 --> 00:18:54,799
[Hakkai] Miss Yaone?
What are you doing here?

249
00:18:54,899 --> 00:18:58,566
We've been waiting for the
opportunity to come take
back the Seiten Scripture.

250
00:18:58,666 --> 00:19:00,366
Nice to see you, Mr. Hakkai.

251
00:19:00,466 --> 00:19:03,366
When you and your three little
friends assaulted the tower,

252
00:19:03,466 --> 00:19:05,866
it was as good an
opportunity as any.

253
00:19:06,699 --> 00:19:08,966
But this is sad.

254
00:19:09,066 --> 00:19:13,099
[Hakkai] A member of
Homura's entourage has
cast a spell of Konzai.

255
00:19:13,199 --> 00:19:17,066
The cursed is forced to battle
a past he cannot escape.

256
00:19:17,166 --> 00:19:18,632
There's no such thing.

257
00:19:18,732 --> 00:19:21,666
You always were a weakling,
little brother.

258
00:19:21,766 --> 00:19:23,966
[Gojyo] Say what?
[Dokugakuji] Sure,
the sins of your past

259
00:19:24,066 --> 00:19:27,632
may come after ya if you're
stupid enough to try and run
away from them.

260
00:19:27,732 --> 00:19:30,666
But if you face them head on,
you'll see they're nothing

261
00:19:30,766 --> 00:19:33,432
but an old bag of
powerless memories.

262
00:19:33,532 --> 00:19:36,132
They're nothing
to be afraid of.

263
00:19:36,232 --> 00:19:38,732
But didn't you... long ago?

264
00:19:38,832 --> 00:19:42,566
Yes, it's true. I once took
that woman's life from her.

265
00:19:42,666 --> 00:19:44,099
I can't deny it.

266
00:19:44,199 --> 00:19:48,999
And I will never ever turn
away from what I have done.

267
00:19:49,099 --> 00:19:51,166
I open up my eyes and look.

268
00:19:51,266 --> 00:19:53,732
I look at what my
past is made of!

269
00:19:58,166 --> 00:20:00,099
You have to be strong!

270
00:20:02,466 --> 00:20:05,799
[Hakkai] You thought it was okay
to let your mother kill you?

271
00:20:05,899 --> 00:20:08,066
That guilt is what
gives her strength.

272
00:20:10,299 --> 00:20:11,432
[Yaone] Look out!

273
00:20:13,599 --> 00:20:15,632
All right! That does it!

274
00:20:15,732 --> 00:20:17,099
I've had enough!

275
00:20:26,032 --> 00:20:27,166
My mother...

276
00:20:28,899 --> 00:20:31,566
was more beautiful
than that thing.

277
00:20:35,599 --> 00:20:37,632
Now then. Shall we?

278
00:20:41,499 --> 00:20:44,899
It's time to open the
door to the new world.
