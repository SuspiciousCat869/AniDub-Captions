1
00:01:35,334 --> 00:01:37,467
[Monkeys screech]

2
00:01:38,001 --> 00:01:39,134
[Demon yells]

3
00:01:42,683 --> 00:01:44,316
Man! They're tough!

4
00:01:44,416 --> 00:01:46,483
They're a hell of a lot
more than I bargained for!

5
00:01:47,483 --> 00:01:48,616
[Demon yells]

6
00:01:50,449 --> 00:01:52,083
What, are you blind?

7
00:01:52,183 --> 00:01:53,949
Do we look like ducks?

8
00:01:54,049 --> 00:01:57,049
Maybe one of us looks
like a monkey, but...

9
00:01:57,149 --> 00:01:59,449
At least I'm no water sprite!

10
00:01:59,549 --> 00:02:02,049
This wasn't the deal.

11
00:02:02,149 --> 00:02:03,416
[Hakkai] I apologize.

12
00:02:03,516 --> 00:02:06,183
I'm not usually this prone
to random acts of violence.

13
00:02:06,283 --> 00:02:08,783
But I'm afraid you caught
me on a really bad day.

14
00:02:12,283 --> 00:02:14,549
[Demon] A banishing gun!

15
00:02:14,649 --> 00:02:17,483
Why you're no...
no ordinary monk!

16
00:02:17,583 --> 00:02:19,249
They... they lied to us!

17
00:02:19,349 --> 00:02:20,483
[One lone gunshot]

18
00:02:20,583 --> 00:02:21,716
[Demon yells]

19
00:02:24,683 --> 00:02:26,916
<i>[Sanzo] A trick?</i>

20
00:02:27,016 --> 00:02:29,983
[Goku] They hardly
seemed worth the trouble.

21
00:02:30,083 --> 00:02:32,083
When it's that easy
to kick their ass,

22
00:02:32,183 --> 00:02:34,449
that's when I start to worry.

23
00:02:34,583 --> 00:02:38,483
They didn't really seem like
assassins, that's for sure.

24
00:02:38,583 --> 00:02:42,316
Could be some bandits
got a little more than
they bargained for.

25
00:02:45,649 --> 00:02:47,816
Whoa, you guys smell something?

26
00:02:47,916 --> 00:02:49,049
[Sanzo] Hm?

27
00:02:52,016 --> 00:02:55,683
Hey! Look guys! I found it!

28
00:02:55,783 --> 00:02:58,349
[Goku] Hey! I got it first,
you purple haired pansy!
[Gojyo] Why this is... grade A,

29
00:02:58,449 --> 00:02:59,616
[Gojyo] homebrewed...

30
00:02:59,716 --> 00:03:01,683
WIIIIIIINE!

31
00:03:07,783 --> 00:03:09,783
[Goku] "The Broken Promise".

32
00:03:17,916 --> 00:03:19,683
My sweet, sweet baby!

33
00:03:19,783 --> 00:03:23,483
Who do you think would ferment
wine in an old tree like that?

34
00:03:23,583 --> 00:03:24,616
[Hakkai chuckles]

35
00:03:24,716 --> 00:03:25,949
A monkey, that's who.

36
00:03:26,049 --> 00:03:29,949
Not you too, Hakkai!
What'd I do to you?

37
00:03:30,049 --> 00:03:34,783
Duuumbass. The monkey he's
referring to isn't you, dork.

38
00:03:34,883 --> 00:03:38,883
He meant monkeys, real monkeys
made the wine, not you.

39
00:03:39,916 --> 00:03:41,716
Oh please.

40
00:03:41,849 --> 00:03:47,183
[Hakkai] Monkeys sometimes
gather fruits into tree hollows,
that then ferment to make wine.

41
00:03:47,283 --> 00:03:49,883
They call it monkey wine,
I believe.

42
00:03:49,983 --> 00:03:52,283
Wow, that's so weird.

43
00:03:52,383 --> 00:03:53,783
[Gojyo chuckles]

44
00:03:53,883 --> 00:03:56,816
[Gojyo] So you see, real
monkeys are so much smarter.

45
00:03:56,916 --> 00:03:59,816
I don't recall you ever
making wine, so what
does that make you?

46
00:03:59,916 --> 00:04:03,049
[Gojyo] My talents come
later on in the process.
I'm a drinking specialist.

47
00:04:03,149 --> 00:04:06,449
[Goku] What's so special
about up-chucking?
[Sanzo] So now we're
stealing from monkeys.

48
00:04:06,549 --> 00:04:08,016
That's pathetic.

49
00:04:08,616 --> 00:04:10,483
That so?

50
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:11,716
So, you want some?

51
00:04:19,849 --> 00:04:25,349
You see? It's not so pathetic
to steal from monkeys when
it taste like that, eh?

52
00:04:25,449 --> 00:04:28,216
I'm only drinking what
the bartender gave me,

53
00:04:28,316 --> 00:04:31,049
so technically it's
not like I stole it.

54
00:04:31,149 --> 00:04:37,383
Aye aye aye. You monks aren't
more moral than us, you just
rationalize a lot better.

55
00:04:37,483 --> 00:04:42,916
[Sanzo] Hmph.
[Goku] Hey, Sanzo. Let
me have a sip, will ya?

56
00:04:43,016 --> 00:04:44,649
[Sanzo] No, you're just a kid.

57
00:04:45,983 --> 00:04:49,083
[Goku] Don't be such a hard-ass!
You drank when you were a kid!

58
00:04:49,183 --> 00:04:51,783
Holy temples do not
stock liquor, idiot.

59
00:04:51,883 --> 00:04:54,883
They only keep a supply
of spirits handy.

60
00:04:54,983 --> 00:04:56,849
[Hakkai chuckles]
[Gojyo] That's too good.

61
00:04:57,516 --> 00:04:59,349
What? What are spirits?

62
00:05:00,516 --> 00:05:03,383
Basically, it's just liquor.

63
00:05:05,283 --> 00:05:07,183
Then you WERE drinking,
you big liar!

64
00:05:07,283 --> 00:05:09,983
Shut up. You can call
it whatever you want,

65
00:05:10,083 --> 00:05:13,049
but I'm telling you, I didn't
drink when I was a little kid.

66
00:05:13,149 --> 00:05:14,716
He's lying.

67
00:05:14,816 --> 00:05:18,883
And little brats like you
should not be in a hurry
to start drinking.

68
00:05:33,383 --> 00:05:35,549
[Monks chuckling and having
a good time, loudly]

69
00:05:37,116 --> 00:05:38,749
[All] Kouryuu!

70
00:05:41,249 --> 00:05:44,649
So you're skipping
training to drink?

71
00:05:44,749 --> 00:05:48,449
But, we aren't drinking any
wine. This is spirits.

72
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:52,749
Calling it something else
won't change what it is.

73
00:05:55,383 --> 00:05:56,883
[Monk] No, wait, Kouryuu!

74
00:05:56,983 --> 00:05:58,349
Won't you have a drink with us?

75
00:06:01,349 --> 00:06:04,116
If you can't even handle
a simple drink, w-well then

76
00:06:04,216 --> 00:06:08,216
you're not strong enough to be
here with us. Isn't that right?

77
00:06:08,316 --> 00:06:11,649
Yes, yes! Don't you want to
be worthy, just like us?

78
00:06:11,749 --> 00:06:14,416
Like Priest Koumyou Sanzo?

79
00:06:14,516 --> 00:06:16,783
[Koumyou] So I'm only
worthy of a drunkard.

80
00:06:16,883 --> 00:06:18,783
[Monks gasp]

81
00:06:18,883 --> 00:06:20,616
[Monks fumbled out "Priest
Sanzo" and "Master Sanzo"]

82
00:06:20,716 --> 00:06:22,183
[Monk 1] I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
[Monk 2] Please forgive us!

83
00:06:25,349 --> 00:06:27,049
Master Sanzo...

84
00:06:31,216 --> 00:06:33,116
[Koumyou] Kouryuu.

85
00:06:33,216 --> 00:06:37,049
Do not be in too much of a
hurry to indulge in drinking.

86
00:06:39,983 --> 00:06:43,416
Drinking is much like
the wine itself.

87
00:06:43,516 --> 00:06:45,783
It can only be enjoyed
once the body and soul
have fully matured.

88
00:06:49,783 --> 00:06:54,716
If your body is young,
my dear, young apprentice,
the wine will eat away at it.

89
00:06:54,816 --> 00:06:59,816
And likewise if the soul
is too young, then the wine
will eat away at that too.

90
00:06:59,916 --> 00:07:03,149
A taste before the proper
age will be bitter.

91
00:07:04,649 --> 00:07:07,316
[Koymyou] Kouryuu...
[Kouryuu] Yes, sir?

92
00:07:07,416 --> 00:07:10,983
[Koumyou] Concentrate on
your studies and you will
become a man soon enough.

93
00:07:11,083 --> 00:07:12,549
And when that happens...

94
00:07:14,949 --> 00:07:18,249
Let us both have
a drink together.

95
00:07:18,349 --> 00:07:21,583
<i>[Sanzo] But before I could</i>
<i>reach adulthood, my master...</i>

96
00:07:23,049 --> 00:07:25,116
[Goku] Sanzo? Sanzo?

97
00:07:30,483 --> 00:07:31,549
I told you not to drink!

98
00:07:31,649 --> 00:07:34,616
Come on! I just want a taste!

99
00:07:34,716 --> 00:07:36,516
Is that right?

100
00:07:36,616 --> 00:07:37,916
[Gojyo] Hey man, what gives?

101
00:07:38,016 --> 00:07:40,349
Well, we'll just see about that.

102
00:07:40,449 --> 00:07:41,149
Bottoms up!

103
00:07:41,249 --> 00:07:42,816
[Goku & Gojyo] Heeey!

104
00:07:42,916 --> 00:07:47,083
Hey Sanzo, I don't suppose you
could please leave some for me.

105
00:07:51,583 --> 00:07:55,516
Well, looks like it's all gone.
It smelled so good too.

106
00:07:55,616 --> 00:07:58,683
Dammit, I was looking foward
to trying some homemade hooch.

107
00:08:00,549 --> 00:08:02,716
Well? What are we waiting for?

108
00:08:02,816 --> 00:08:06,416
We're in town, guys!
You know what that means!

109
00:08:06,516 --> 00:08:08,483
I can get some food!

110
00:08:08,583 --> 00:08:11,449
Oh well. Can't really
argue with that, can I?

111
00:08:11,549 --> 00:08:14,583
And I know I could sure use a
glass of wine with my dinner.

112
00:08:14,683 --> 00:08:18,516
Right? And I think you
should pay for it... Sanzo.

113
00:08:18,616 --> 00:08:19,783
If you say so.

114
00:08:19,883 --> 00:08:22,949
[Goku] C'mon guys!
Stop torturing me!

115
00:08:23,049 --> 00:08:24,716
[Goku] Let's go to town!
[Hakkai] Let's go!

116
00:08:24,816 --> 00:08:27,316
Somehow I doubt they'll
have monkey wine in stock.

117
00:08:27,416 --> 00:08:28,949
[Gojyo] The only reason
you didn't get any is

118
00:08:29,049 --> 00:08:31,049
because the temperance
of our fellow monk here.

119
00:08:31,149 --> 00:08:33,416
[Sanzo] Our teachings
compelled me to do it.

120
00:08:33,516 --> 00:08:34,683
[Gojyo] Is that so?

121
00:08:34,783 --> 00:08:35,916
[Sanzo] I did it for Goku.

122
00:08:36,016 --> 00:08:37,049
[Gojyo] Oh, give it up.

123
00:08:39,716 --> 00:08:42,416
Okay now, are there
any more contestants?

124
00:08:42,516 --> 00:08:46,983
Come on now! Celebrate
our grand opening with us!
All you can drink,

125
00:08:47,083 --> 00:08:49,149
[Goku] Sanzo! Look here!
[Owner] compliments
of the Yamatoya group.

126
00:08:49,249 --> 00:08:50,849
[Goku] Looks like they're
having some kind of contest.
[Owner] You think you
can handle your liquor?

127
00:08:50,949 --> 00:08:52,316
[Owner] Here's your
chance to prove it.

128
00:08:52,416 --> 00:08:53,549
[Hakkai] What is this?
[Owner carries on]

129
00:08:53,649 --> 00:08:55,983
It's a drinking contest
to promote the new tavern

130
00:08:56,083 --> 00:08:57,649
that just opened up in town.

131
00:08:57,749 --> 00:09:00,016
You can't enter unless you've
got a team together.

132
00:09:00,116 --> 00:09:04,649
But if you win, everybody
on the team receives a
year's supply of wine.

133
00:09:04,749 --> 00:09:07,249
That so?

134
00:09:07,349 --> 00:09:11,983
[Sanzo] Don't bother.
Any wine they give you is
bound to be the cheap stuff.

135
00:09:12,083 --> 00:09:15,383
[Fei Youngest] Yeah, yeah. You
just keep telling yourself that.

136
00:09:15,516 --> 00:09:19,849
You three losers couldn't out
drink the famous Fei brothers
even if you tried to.

137
00:09:19,949 --> 00:09:23,616
I believe all I said was
that it's cheap wine.

138
00:09:23,716 --> 00:09:28,316
Don't the little feather weights
always seem to come up with
the lamest excuses.

139
00:09:28,416 --> 00:09:31,549
These guys don't look like
much of a challenge to me.

140
00:09:31,649 --> 00:09:35,316
Are you three hayseeds actually
trying to pick a fight with us?

141
00:09:35,416 --> 00:09:40,983
I'm sorry! Forgive me.
Perhaps I wasn't obvious
enough, so let me be clearer.

142
00:09:41,083 --> 00:09:44,283
Not a single one of you
three panty-waisted pussies

143
00:09:44,383 --> 00:09:47,516
could handle a shot
glass of weak lemonade.

144
00:09:47,649 --> 00:09:50,416
A sissy who dyes his hair pink.

145
00:09:50,516 --> 00:09:53,083
Some dandy who uses a monocle?

146
00:09:53,183 --> 00:09:56,316
And Goldielocks, the
effeminate monk in a dress.

147
00:09:56,416 --> 00:09:58,749
[Fei Eldest laughs]
You gotta be kidding me.

148
00:09:58,849 --> 00:10:02,649
You three girls... might
want to stick with soda pop.

149
00:10:02,749 --> 00:10:04,083
Heh, sure is pretty.

150
00:10:04,183 --> 00:10:05,316
Oh yeah?

151
00:10:10,116 --> 00:10:12,249
Hm? Would you like to sign up?

152
00:10:12,349 --> 00:10:15,783
Yeah, but... Well, uh.
I was simply wondering if

153
00:10:15,883 --> 00:10:19,616
it would be possible if
we could use your best
wine for the contest.

154
00:10:19,716 --> 00:10:22,949
[Owner] You must be joking!
I'd go broke if I did that!

155
00:10:24,016 --> 00:10:25,716
Just put it on my tab.

156
00:10:25,816 --> 00:10:29,249
[Owner] What?!
[Fei Eldest] Whoo! Lucky for us!

157
00:10:29,349 --> 00:10:32,449
[Sanzo] But if I win,
it's on the Fei brothers.

158
00:10:32,549 --> 00:10:34,416
Is this actually for real?

159
00:10:34,516 --> 00:10:36,516
We can't afford to
pay for all that.

160
00:10:36,616 --> 00:10:39,649
What? What happened? Did I
miss something? Fill me in!

161
00:10:39,749 --> 00:10:45,283
Why thank you! Winning
will be twice as sweet
knowing you paid for it.

162
00:10:45,383 --> 00:10:47,649
Why don't you save it till
you've actually won?

163
00:10:47,749 --> 00:10:53,049
Oh boy. Sanzo. Look Hakuryu,
his eyes are already dilated.

164
00:10:53,149 --> 00:10:55,316
And he hasn't had
a drop to drink.

165
00:11:13,422 --> 00:11:14,842
[Owner] Alright!
Attention please!

166
00:11:14,842 --> 00:11:18,375
Everyone get ready! The drinking
contest is about to begin!

167
00:11:18,475 --> 00:11:22,075
Sanzo! Gojyo! Hakkai!
Good luck you guys!

168
00:11:23,009 --> 00:11:25,309
The contest rules are simple.

169
00:11:25,409 --> 00:11:31,642
Drink as much as possible,
and the last team with
someone left standing wins!

170
00:11:31,775 --> 00:11:34,209
Ready... set... begin!

171
00:11:34,309 --> 00:11:43,475
[Crowd cheers wildly]

172
00:11:43,575 --> 00:11:46,875
[Li] Wow, monk, you're
really knocking them back!

173
00:11:46,975 --> 00:11:49,842
So, did you learn to drink like
that in your little seminary?

174
00:11:49,942 --> 00:11:51,475
Tell me where to sign up!

175
00:11:51,575 --> 00:11:53,142
[Current opposing team laughs]

176
00:11:55,809 --> 00:12:00,842
Heeey, you know, my temple's
filled with a bunch of
old fuddy-duddies.

177
00:12:00,942 --> 00:12:02,975
Not like you guys. HURK!

178
00:12:04,875 --> 00:12:05,975
[Sanzo] Pitiful...

179
00:12:07,375 --> 00:12:09,142
That's too funny.

180
00:12:09,242 --> 00:12:12,375
And I haven't even
gotten started yet.
These guys are pathetic.

181
00:12:12,475 --> 00:12:14,909
I hope the others last until
I get a good buzz going.

182
00:12:15,009 --> 00:12:16,542
I need to get smashed.

183
00:12:16,642 --> 00:12:18,242
[Sanzo] We're in good shape.

184
00:12:18,342 --> 00:12:20,675
But we've still got
a long way to go.

185
00:12:20,775 --> 00:12:23,675
And we'll drink plenty by
the time the day's through.

186
00:12:23,775 --> 00:12:27,409
Heh! We'll I'll be damned.
That monk's not half bad.

187
00:12:27,509 --> 00:12:31,975
That's true. But he's not
nearly good enough to beat
the likes of us, man.

188
00:12:32,075 --> 00:12:33,209
You said it!

189
00:12:36,609 --> 00:12:40,009
Sanzo! Gojyo! Hakkai!
Hang in there!

190
00:12:41,809 --> 00:12:45,009
[Owner] Looks like we're down
to the real professionals now!

191
00:12:45,109 --> 00:12:50,209
We'll take a short break while
our staff clears away any
passed out participants!

192
00:12:52,275 --> 00:12:55,742
Full of a bunch of...
old fuddy-duddies...

193
00:12:55,842 --> 00:12:58,942
It looks like... things
have just started to...

194
00:12:59,042 --> 00:13:00,542
get interesting, folks!

195
00:13:00,642 --> 00:13:03,242
We're down to the
fabulous Fei brothers!

196
00:13:03,342 --> 00:13:05,509
And the Traveling Monk's Team!

197
00:13:05,609 --> 00:13:10,142
Who will be the first to pass
out? Let's find out, shall we?

198
00:13:10,242 --> 00:13:12,375
[Crowd cheers wildly]

199
00:13:15,242 --> 00:13:18,842
Sanzo! Gojyo! Hakkai!
Show 'em who's boss!

200
00:13:18,942 --> 00:13:21,775
I wish that stupid monkey
would just shut the hell up.

201
00:13:21,875 --> 00:13:24,975
[Gojyo] Hoo-ee, he's giving
me a pounding headache.

202
00:13:25,075 --> 00:13:27,242
Hey! C'mon! Bring on the booze!

203
00:13:27,342 --> 00:13:29,209
[Gojyo] Huh?

204
00:13:29,309 --> 00:13:33,042
Come to think of it,
I've never actually
seen Hakkai drunk before.

205
00:13:33,142 --> 00:13:35,042
[Sanzo] We might have
underestimated him.

206
00:13:35,142 --> 00:13:37,475
What's wrong? Your
hand looks shaky.

207
00:13:38,042 --> 00:13:39,742
Ha! Not at all.

208
00:13:39,842 --> 00:13:41,975
Why does your face
look so red then?

209
00:13:42,075 --> 00:13:45,509
Whatever. I noticed you guys
were swaying a little bit.

210
00:13:45,609 --> 00:13:48,042
Your vision's already blurry.

211
00:13:48,142 --> 00:13:50,275
[Crowd cheers]

212
00:14:03,275 --> 00:14:05,875
Hehe. What's wrong, Goldielocks?

213
00:14:05,975 --> 00:14:08,709
You look woozy.
That all you got?

214
00:14:10,775 --> 00:14:13,742
I didn't hurt yer feelins,
did I, pretty boy?

215
00:14:18,675 --> 00:14:19,709
[Hakkai] Sanzo?

216
00:14:19,809 --> 00:14:21,375
You dumb bastard.

217
00:14:21,475 --> 00:14:24,575
You actually have the
gall to mock me, do you?

218
00:14:24,675 --> 00:14:25,542
Maten-!

219
00:14:25,642 --> 00:14:26,675
PLEASE!

220
00:14:26,775 --> 00:14:28,042
Don't you think unleashing a

221
00:14:28,142 --> 00:14:31,009
scripture that controls Heaven
and Earth is a little severe?

222
00:14:31,642 --> 00:14:32,775
[Sanzo] Hakkai.

223
00:14:33,309 --> 00:14:34,042
[Hakkai] Yeah?

224
00:14:34,142 --> 00:14:35,675
It's all up to you now.

225
00:14:37,275 --> 00:14:38,409
[Hakkai] Sanzo!

226
00:14:40,409 --> 00:14:41,709
[Glass falls over]
[Hakkai] Huh?

227
00:14:41,809 --> 00:14:45,409
[Gojyo snores softly]

228
00:14:45,509 --> 00:14:48,475
Well then, it looks like
it's up to me and...

229
00:14:49,275 --> 00:14:50,675
[Snores]

230
00:14:50,775 --> 00:14:51,909
[Hakkai] Look at that.

231
00:14:53,542 --> 00:14:56,475
Listen! We have
ourselves a champion!

232
00:14:56,575 --> 00:14:58,642
The traveling monk's team wins!

233
00:14:58,742 --> 00:15:01,875
[Crowd cheers]

234
00:15:05,009 --> 00:15:06,842
Wow, they did it!

235
00:15:06,942 --> 00:15:09,009
Hakkai! Way to go!

236
00:15:11,775 --> 00:15:13,509
I... did...

237
00:15:13,609 --> 00:15:14,742
Okay.

238
00:15:26,042 --> 00:15:30,209
[Owner] Hahahaha! I gotta
hand it to you, you sure
can hold your liquor.

239
00:15:30,842 --> 00:15:31,975
Drink up!

240
00:15:32,075 --> 00:15:36,042
Yes, well, maybe just one
more drink, if you insist.

241
00:15:36,142 --> 00:15:39,442
Though, I should probably find
a place for them to sleep.

242
00:15:39,542 --> 00:15:44,342
Oh, well. If that's all you
four gentlemen are looking
for, than look no further!

243
00:15:44,442 --> 00:15:46,575
You're more than welcome
to stay here tonight.

244
00:15:46,675 --> 00:15:50,842
Are you sure? Why thank you!
Then just one more.

245
00:16:20,375 --> 00:16:21,642
[Owner chuckles]

246
00:16:21,742 --> 00:16:25,709
[Owner] You get to die, passed
out, drunk on good wine.

247
00:16:25,809 --> 00:16:27,475
More than you jerks deserve.

248
00:16:28,442 --> 00:16:29,575
What the-?

249
00:16:31,742 --> 00:16:32,942
Wha-what is this?!

250
00:16:33,042 --> 00:16:35,475
You cheap bastard.

251
00:16:35,575 --> 00:16:38,209
Attacking us while
we're passed out, huh?

252
00:16:38,309 --> 00:16:40,175
I bet chicks hate you.

253
00:16:40,275 --> 00:16:42,342
[Hakkai] Not very hospitable.

254
00:16:46,209 --> 00:16:49,875
[Gojyo] Hey, wake up. Your
family's here to see you.

255
00:16:51,675 --> 00:16:52,809
Cut that out.

256
00:16:53,742 --> 00:16:55,909
What the hell's going on here?!

257
00:16:56,009 --> 00:16:59,542
You knew I wanted you dead?
How did you know?

258
00:16:59,642 --> 00:17:03,609
Moron, your wine
was way too good.

259
00:17:03,709 --> 00:17:06,875
Some of the liquor you served
us, was the exact same monkey

260
00:17:06,975 --> 00:17:10,175
wine we found in the forest
on our way into town.

261
00:17:10,275 --> 00:17:12,009
That was what tipped us off.

262
00:17:12,109 --> 00:17:14,875
I had hoped that would
slip by all of you.

263
00:17:14,975 --> 00:17:17,142
We are connoisseurs.

264
00:17:17,242 --> 00:17:21,342
And I willing to place
a bet that you sent
those demons as well.

265
00:17:23,009 --> 00:17:25,242
I'm not terribly impressed.

266
00:17:25,342 --> 00:17:26,875
Damn it.

267
00:17:26,975 --> 00:17:29,809
You can call me Shin!
Shin Taijin!

268
00:17:29,909 --> 00:17:32,509
The one who will
kill all of you!

269
00:17:32,609 --> 00:17:34,009
Attack!

270
00:17:34,109 --> 00:17:37,109
Hey! You have monkeys do
your fighting for you?!

271
00:17:37,209 --> 00:17:41,542
Ha! That's all that I require
to take care of a bunch
of worthless drunks!

272
00:17:41,642 --> 00:17:44,042
Uck. I don't care for
your style, old man!

273
00:17:46,009 --> 00:17:48,175
There's not enough room
for us to fight in here!

274
00:17:48,275 --> 00:17:49,809
Let's take this outside!

275
00:17:51,075 --> 00:17:53,942
Something wrong?
Why are you staggering?

276
00:17:56,809 --> 00:17:58,475
Hey, listen monkeys!

277
00:18:00,175 --> 00:18:02,709
I'm about to teach you
degenerate primates the

278
00:18:02,809 --> 00:18:05,409
true meaning of the
little phrase for...

279
00:18:05,509 --> 00:18:06,942
"Let's take it outside"!

280
00:18:09,542 --> 00:18:12,942
Dammit to hell! These monkeys
sure are a pain in the ass!

281
00:18:13,042 --> 00:18:14,675
I resent that!

282
00:18:14,775 --> 00:18:16,509
You resemble that.

283
00:18:16,609 --> 00:18:19,875
Goku, remember those monkeys
are being manipulated.

284
00:18:19,975 --> 00:18:21,642
Please go easy on them.

285
00:18:21,742 --> 00:18:22,909
Roger!

286
00:18:23,009 --> 00:18:24,675
You guys really annoy me!

287
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:31,475
They really are drunk!

288
00:18:31,575 --> 00:18:35,009
What's going outside... what's
that suppose to accomplish?

289
00:18:35,942 --> 00:18:37,175
Huh?

290
00:18:37,275 --> 00:18:38,742
Impossible!

291
00:18:38,842 --> 00:18:40,275
Sorry we're late.

292
00:18:40,375 --> 00:18:43,475
How... could you...
kill them all?!

293
00:18:43,575 --> 00:18:44,975
We didn't.

294
00:18:45,109 --> 00:18:47,942
If there's one thing we know,
it's how to handle a monky.

295
00:18:48,609 --> 00:18:50,242
I'm no monkey!

296
00:18:50,842 --> 00:18:52,475
Handle this!

297
00:18:53,509 --> 00:18:55,142
Learn to heel!

298
00:19:02,409 --> 00:19:03,809
[Monkeys squeak]

299
00:19:03,909 --> 00:19:05,109
How cute!

300
00:19:05,209 --> 00:19:07,609
Hey you guys, look at the-

301
00:19:07,709 --> 00:19:09,742
Hey! Guys, get 'em off me!

302
00:19:09,842 --> 00:19:12,375
[Gojyo] Aw, look. Back
with his own kind.
[Goku] Get 'em off me! Guys!

303
00:19:12,475 --> 00:19:16,642
That was a pretty
mean trick you played.
Acting all drunk like that.

304
00:19:17,275 --> 00:19:19,209
No act...

305
00:19:19,309 --> 00:19:21,709
I'm completely plastered.

306
00:19:21,809 --> 00:19:26,809
But there's a very wise saying
I heard a long time ago.

307
00:19:26,909 --> 00:19:28,975
[Koumyou] Kouryuu, there's an
old saying that's been passed

308
00:19:29,075 --> 00:19:32,009
down from generation
to generation.

309
00:19:32,109 --> 00:19:34,309
It goes something like this.

310
00:19:34,409 --> 00:19:35,542
"Consume wine...

311
00:19:37,375 --> 00:19:40,109
[Koumyou & Sanzo] don't let
the wine consume you."

312
00:19:42,775 --> 00:19:46,742
Oooh my. How can they sleep in
the middle of a bar like that?

313
00:19:47,442 --> 00:19:48,575
Hey, Sanzo.

314
00:19:52,209 --> 00:19:53,842
What can you do?

315
00:20:08,057 --> 00:20:09,424
[Koumyou] Kouryuu!

316
00:20:10,791 --> 00:20:12,424
Kouryuu!

317
00:20:14,857 --> 00:20:16,591
[Kouryuu] Master...

318
00:20:16,691 --> 00:20:18,591
Shall we share a drink?

319
00:20:19,291 --> 00:20:21,224
Really? But I'm just...

320
00:20:43,124 --> 00:20:47,324
[Sanzo] Aaaaah. Wine
never tasted so good.
