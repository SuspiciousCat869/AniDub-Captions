1
00:01:34,787 --> 00:01:41,121
[Yaone] Sanzo and the betrayers
travel north by northwest, seven
kilometers from our location.

2
00:01:41,221 --> 00:01:43,921
[Dokugakauj] They rode in on a
dragon that turns into a jeep.

3
00:01:44,021 --> 00:01:46,654
They make shit time. We can head
'em off, no problem.

4
00:01:46,754 --> 00:01:48,754
[Kougaji] And what of
Mother's orders?

5
00:01:48,854 --> 00:01:51,021
[Doku] Send in more assassins,
of course.

6
00:01:51,121 --> 00:01:52,821
Bad idea if you ask me.

7
00:01:52,921 --> 00:01:54,654
[Kougaji] Of course it's a
bad idea!

8
00:01:54,754 --> 00:01:56,754
I'm sick of losing
my brothers!

9
00:01:56,854 --> 00:02:00,921
She throws warriors at them as
if they were sticks for a fire!

10
00:02:01,054 --> 00:02:02,521
[Doku] Relax. That's why we're
having this discussion, hothead.

11
00:02:05,354 --> 00:02:08,654
[Lirin] I'm over this already!
Why are we talking about this?!

12
00:02:08,754 --> 00:02:11,287
Let's just go and take care of
them ourselves!

13
00:02:11,387 --> 00:02:16,754
<i>She's right. If I want to save</i>
<i>Mother I have to fight myself.</i>

14
00:02:16,854 --> 00:02:17,987
<i>It's just...</i>

15
00:02:18,087 --> 00:02:21,854
[Doku] Kou, Lirin's right.
We can take them down.

16
00:02:21,954 --> 00:02:25,854
Or are you feeling a little
nervous about this bitch and
her little demonic revival?

17
00:02:25,954 --> 00:02:29,154
I'm just fine! I know what needs
to happen here.

18
00:02:30,921 --> 00:02:32,121
[Yaone] My Lord...

19
00:02:32,221 --> 00:02:33,687
You have something to say?

20
00:02:35,987 --> 00:02:39,654
Why don't you allow me to go
and kill them?

21
00:03:14,421 --> 00:03:15,454
[Yaone] I have an idea.

22
00:03:15,554 --> 00:03:17,221
[Kougaiji] No, it's
too dangerous.

23
00:03:17,321 --> 00:03:18,887
[Yaone] You're being stubborn.

24
00:03:18,987 --> 00:03:23,254
Let me do this. Think of it as a
pay back for the time you were
there for me.

25
00:03:23,354 --> 00:03:24,821
[Kougaiji] I said no.

26
00:03:24,921 --> 00:03:30,154
[Yaone] Then look at it
this way, I am your own
personal apothecary.

27
00:03:30,254 --> 00:03:35,821
I've got a way with powders and
powers. I can use them to
heal... or to kill.

28
00:03:39,287 --> 00:03:40,487
Okay. You win.

29
00:03:40,621 --> 00:03:42,021
No way! So you'll let me?

30
00:03:42,121 --> 00:03:45,621
Hold it! I don't want you to go
yet, you need to listen to
me, Yaone.

31
00:03:45,721 --> 00:03:47,521
I know they look like the
biggest bunch of dumbasses,

32
00:03:48,287 --> 00:03:50,054
but they're very powerful.

33
00:03:50,154 --> 00:03:51,921
Don't take any risks.

34
00:03:52,021 --> 00:03:54,587
I won't. I've got a plan.

35
00:03:57,287 --> 00:04:00,054
I know where they are. They've
got to stop and eat sometime.

36
00:04:00,154 --> 00:04:04,087
I'll set up at a tavern, get a
job and wait.

37
00:04:04,187 --> 00:04:07,487
And when they show up I'll
suggest the blue plate,

38
00:04:07,587 --> 00:04:12,787
and they'll never know just what
ingredient makes it special
until it's too late.

39
00:04:12,887 --> 00:04:15,154
Miss, another plate of
xiaolongbao, please!

40
00:04:15,254 --> 00:04:16,921
Another beer when you get a
minute, honey!

41
00:04:17,021 --> 00:04:19,954
Yaone, don't forget table 20 and
that pork chop!

42
00:04:21,621 --> 00:04:23,787
<i>Me and my bright ideas.</i>

43
00:04:28,487 --> 00:04:30,521
Hey! That is not on the menu!

44
00:04:30,621 --> 00:04:34,354
Oh, come on! Look, I'm a really
big tipper.

45
00:04:36,754 --> 00:04:38,121
OW!

46
00:04:38,221 --> 00:04:39,721
What the hell did you do
that for?!

47
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:43,054
Who did it?! Did you see?
Who did it?

48
00:04:43,154 --> 00:04:45,221
Who threw the damn ashtray?!

49
00:04:46,354 --> 00:04:47,321
<i>There they are!</i>

50
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:50,554
Okay miss, we're all ready to
order now.

51
00:04:50,654 --> 00:04:52,154
Yeah, I'll be right there!

52
00:04:52,254 --> 00:04:53,887
[Goku] Gimme the sweet-and-
sour pork,
[Gojyo] A bottle of import,

53
00:04:53,987 --> 00:04:55,187
[Goku] liver and scallions,
and the
[Gojyo] uh, some crab cakes,

54
00:04:55,287 --> 00:04:56,487
[Goku] prawns in chili sauce,
[Gojyo] fried noodles

55
00:04:56,587 --> 00:04:57,721
[Goku] Let's see what else?
[Sanzo] Will you shut up?!

56
00:04:57,821 --> 00:04:59,987
Great! But can I reccomend the
blue plate special?

57
00:05:00,087 --> 00:05:02,787
[Gojyo] Sure, we'll have one
of those and an ashtray.

58
00:05:05,654 --> 00:05:08,154
<i>They're the ones who threw</i>
<i>the ashtray?</i>

59
00:05:09,487 --> 00:05:13,987
<i>Hmph, the one they save is the</i>
<i>one to slay them.</i>

60
00:05:14,087 --> 00:05:15,287
<i>How ironic.</i>

61
00:05:17,054 --> 00:05:18,721
[Sanzo] So, what do you think?

62
00:05:18,821 --> 00:05:21,621
[Gojyo] About what? What are you
talking about?

63
00:05:21,721 --> 00:05:24,821
[Sanzo] It's been over a month
since we left Chang'an.

64
00:05:24,921 --> 00:05:28,754
Iced as many demons as there are
stars in the sky,

65
00:05:28,854 --> 00:05:30,121
and almost all of them assassins
sent by Gyumaoh's number one
son Kougaiji.

66
00:05:34,521 --> 00:05:40,054
You know demons, there about as
fond of taking orders as Goku's
fond of you.

67
00:05:40,154 --> 00:05:44,454
Yet, the demons seem willing
to follow Kougaiji to their
own graves.

68
00:05:44,554 --> 00:05:47,187
[Gojyo] Just don't get sloppy
or distracted.

69
00:05:47,287 --> 00:05:50,387
They'll keep coming all the way
till we get there.

70
00:05:50,487 --> 00:05:53,621
[Hakkai] I'm not so concerned
about why they follow Kougaiji.

71
00:05:53,721 --> 00:05:57,887
What I want to know is who
Kougaiji's taking orders from.

72
00:05:57,987 --> 00:05:59,821
[Yaone] Here it is!

73
00:05:59,921 --> 00:06:02,921
You're gonna love it! It's to
die for.

74
00:06:03,021 --> 00:06:04,154
Yeah!

75
00:06:06,021 --> 00:06:09,487
It looks like this is the whole
menu. You think we ordered
enough food?

76
00:06:09,587 --> 00:06:11,621
For Goku I wouldn't bet on it.

77
00:06:11,721 --> 00:06:14,354
[Goku] Let's eat! I'm starvin'
to death!

78
00:06:17,287 --> 00:06:20,021
<i>Well, you've got the death</i>
<i>part right.</i>

79
00:06:22,421 --> 00:06:24,187
Alright everybody, dig in!

80
00:06:24,287 --> 00:06:24,887
[Tray hits the floor]

81
00:06:24,987 --> 00:06:26,754
[Yaone][startled yelp]

82
00:06:26,854 --> 00:06:29,921
You're right man, I think the
service could be much
better here.

83
00:06:30,021 --> 00:06:33,154
Stop! Let go! I've got tables to
wait on!

84
00:06:33,254 --> 00:06:37,021
<i>I could kill him in a second.</i>
<i>God, I hate undercover work!</i>

85
00:06:37,121 --> 00:06:39,054
Ow! Ow! Ah!

86
00:06:39,154 --> 00:06:43,587
You don't like the service here?
Maybe you should order some
thing else.

87
00:06:43,687 --> 00:06:46,754
[Bandana] Buddy, you better let
him go, nice and easy.

88
00:06:46,854 --> 00:06:49,954
Shut up, or I'm gonna nail
you with another ashtray.

89
00:06:50,054 --> 00:06:51,487
Right here, bang.

90
00:06:51,587 --> 00:06:54,521
You did it?! Well it's about
time you came clean!

91
00:06:58,454 --> 00:07:00,854
Oh, thanks a lot, jerk.

92
00:07:00,954 --> 00:07:08,454
[Goku cries dramaticly]

93
00:07:09,721 --> 00:07:12,654
You! What kind of monster
are you?!

94
00:07:12,754 --> 00:07:15,387
I believe I feel a food fight
coming on.

95
00:07:15,487 --> 00:07:16,754
Loser picks up the check.

96
00:07:16,854 --> 00:07:19,654
Bring it on, litte brat! I'll
kick your ass!

97
00:07:19,754 --> 00:07:20,487
Oh yeah?!

98
00:07:20,587 --> 00:07:21,621
Yeah! Get 'em!

99
00:07:21,721 --> 00:07:26,821
[Fighting sounds]

100
00:07:26,921 --> 00:07:29,687
I find it mildly disconcerting
that they're fighting the very

101
00:07:29,787 --> 00:07:31,654
same people we're supposed to
be protecting.

102
00:07:31,754 --> 00:07:33,587
I'm not getting stuck with the
check again.

103
00:07:33,687 --> 00:07:36,921
You're friends of theirs aren't
you? Get up and fight like
a man!

104
00:07:40,021 --> 00:07:41,654
Face flat on the floor.

105
00:07:41,754 --> 00:07:44,621
I think these boys have had
quite enough to drink.
Don't you?

106
00:07:44,721 --> 00:07:46,387
[Both drunks] We're just getting
this party started.

107
00:07:46,487 --> 00:07:47,521
So let's do this.

108
00:07:47,621 --> 00:07:49,521
[Fighting continues]

109
00:07:49,621 --> 00:07:53,287
[Owner] Stop it! Gentlemen!
Please, stop it!

110
00:07:53,387 --> 00:07:59,887
[Fighting continues]

111
00:07:59,987 --> 00:08:03,887
<i>Kougaiji said not to trust</i>
<i>them, that they're the enemy.</i>

112
00:08:03,987 --> 00:08:08,454
<i>He said not to take any risks.</i>
<i>Is this some kind of trick?</i>

113
00:08:08,587 --> 00:08:12,554
<i>It's just that... they're</i>
<i>different. Different than</i>
<i>I thought they'd be.</i>

114
00:08:12,654 --> 00:08:14,054
[Hakkai] I'm sorry about
all this.

115
00:08:14,154 --> 00:08:16,987
I know sometimes our methods can
be extreme.

116
00:08:17,087 --> 00:08:18,321
[Yaone] It's not that.

117
00:08:23,087 --> 00:08:26,421
We're just trying to save a
pretty lady from an ugly thing.

118
00:08:38,054 --> 00:08:41,954
[Kougaiji] You there. Stop.
What are you doing?

119
00:08:42,054 --> 00:08:43,487
[Servant] Your Highness!

120
00:08:43,587 --> 00:08:46,221
Apparently she is daughter
of a medicine merchant,

121
00:08:46,321 --> 00:08:50,187
because of her beauty, she is to
be presented to Hyakugan Maoh.

122
00:08:55,287 --> 00:08:58,587
Well there's a change in plan,
she's mine now.

123
00:08:58,687 --> 00:08:59,854
Come with me.

124
00:08:59,954 --> 00:09:01,854
But... Y-Your Highness...

125
00:09:04,454 --> 00:09:09,487
[Kougaiji] Maoh has this little
habbit of treating beautiful
women like playthings,

126
00:09:09,587 --> 00:09:11,921
then eats them when he becomes
bored with them.

127
00:09:13,454 --> 00:09:14,454
Don't get me wrong now.

128
00:09:14,587 --> 00:09:16,754
I didn't save you for any
romantic notions.

129
00:09:16,854 --> 00:09:19,954
But from here on out you're
working for me.

130
00:09:20,054 --> 00:09:23,754
As an apothecary, of course.
Do you understand?

131
00:09:30,654 --> 00:09:33,687
Yes, I understand.

132
00:09:37,687 --> 00:09:38,821
Thank you.

133
00:09:40,321 --> 00:09:45,054
<i>And he kept is his word.</i>
<i>He never asked anything</i>
<i>more of me.</i>

134
00:09:45,154 --> 00:09:48,121
<i>Why do I feel so hesitant?</i>

135
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:52,554
<i>Is this how I repay him for</i>
<i>his kindness? With betrayl?</i>

136
00:09:52,654 --> 00:09:57,487
<i>These men are the enemy and</i>
<i>Kougaiji's enemies are</i>
<i>my enemies.</i>

137
00:10:00,621 --> 00:10:03,587
Wow. So you want some more?

138
00:10:03,687 --> 00:10:06,154
Okay then, come on.

139
00:10:06,254 --> 00:10:11,054
You asshole! You won't be nearly
as cocky when my friends and I
get through with you.

140
00:10:21,387 --> 00:10:23,121
Damn, my eyes are on fire.

141
00:10:23,221 --> 00:10:25,554
Something's happening.
I can't breathe.

142
00:10:25,654 --> 00:10:27,354
Smells like medicine.

143
00:10:27,454 --> 00:10:29,487
Cover your mouth, don't
breathe in!

144
00:10:38,554 --> 00:10:41,654
Gojyo! Aw no you don't, man.
Wake up!

145
00:10:42,787 --> 00:10:44,421
[Hakkai] Sanzo! Goku!

146
00:10:46,587 --> 00:10:49,121
Still breathing. He's not dead.

147
00:10:50,587 --> 00:10:54,121
[Yaone] No, he's not. It's just
sleeping powder.

148
00:10:54,254 --> 00:10:58,887
We don't want to be dragging
outsiders into our private
affair. I'm sure you agree.

149
00:10:58,987 --> 00:11:01,321
You did this? It was you!

150
00:11:01,421 --> 00:11:04,621
And you, you shouldn't have held
your breath.

151
00:11:07,321 --> 00:11:10,321
You know, I really was hoping
you were going to sleep
through this.

152
00:11:10,421 --> 00:11:11,954
But... oh well.

153
00:11:14,921 --> 00:11:17,521
Her bracelet, it's a
power limiter.

154
00:11:29,554 --> 00:11:33,821
You're an assassin. You're a
demon sent by Kougaiji!

155
00:11:35,554 --> 00:11:38,587
You must be the smart one of
the group.

156
00:11:38,687 --> 00:11:43,054
My name's Yaone. I kinda figured
you might want to know my name.

157
00:11:43,154 --> 00:11:45,787
Because I'm going to kill
you, traitor.

158
00:11:45,887 --> 00:11:48,021
You're going to wish you'd
fallen asleep.

159
00:11:58,109 --> 00:11:59,743
[Hakkai] Why are you doing this?

160
00:11:59,843 --> 00:12:02,809
[Yaone] I was wrong.

161
00:12:02,909 --> 00:12:04,609
You're not the smart one.

162
00:12:06,376 --> 00:12:07,109
En garde!

163
00:12:07,209 --> 00:12:08,809
Hey! Take it easy!

164
00:12:10,476 --> 00:12:11,743
Stand still!

165
00:12:15,909 --> 00:12:17,043
Just die!

166
00:12:25,009 --> 00:12:27,409
Stop. You don't want to kill me.

167
00:12:31,276 --> 00:12:32,409
Maybe she does!

168
00:12:35,076 --> 00:12:36,843
Shit. He's got powers.

169
00:12:36,943 --> 00:12:38,876
Will you please stop this?

170
00:12:44,909 --> 00:12:46,043
Huh?

171
00:12:46,976 --> 00:12:50,443
Sanzo! Get up! Gojyo!

172
00:12:50,543 --> 00:12:52,176
Oh man...

173
00:12:53,276 --> 00:12:55,943
Where's Hakkai? Why's Hakkai
not here?

174
00:12:56,043 --> 00:12:58,176
Well, because he's...

175
00:12:58,276 --> 00:13:00,843
Because he's outside fighting
the waitress.

176
00:13:02,509 --> 00:13:04,343
[Yaone] Why won't you just die?

177
00:13:05,676 --> 00:13:07,209
Aw shit!

178
00:13:07,309 --> 00:13:10,743
I want you to know that you're
the one who forced it to turn
out this way.

179
00:13:10,843 --> 00:13:14,609
When I blow up that tavern all
that blood is going to be on
your hands.

180
00:13:15,576 --> 00:13:17,909
I'm sorry about this,
I really am.

181
00:13:25,443 --> 00:13:28,743
Eeeh, that would be my doing.

182
00:13:28,843 --> 00:13:33,909
My bad. I just saw this bomb
lying around and just defused
so no one got hurt.

183
00:13:37,143 --> 00:13:41,276
<i>I've lost. Kougaiji is going to</i>
<i>kill me.</i>

184
00:13:41,376 --> 00:13:46,609
And he should. I'm not worthy to
serve him. I'm a detrament to
the cause.

185
00:13:47,876 --> 00:13:52,276
[Hakkai] I'm sorry. I mean that,
I'm really sorry.

186
00:13:52,376 --> 00:13:54,443
I wish none of this had
to happen.

187
00:13:59,409 --> 00:14:00,676
[Yaone] Don't touch me!

188
00:14:01,609 --> 00:14:03,043
I thought you were hurt.

189
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:08,576
[Yaone] God don't make it worse,
don't help me. Kill me.

190
00:14:09,843 --> 00:14:10,976
He will.

191
00:14:15,409 --> 00:14:18,109
And he has every right to do so.

192
00:14:18,209 --> 00:14:19,709
I'm worthless!

193
00:14:20,409 --> 00:14:20,943
Wait!

194
00:14:21,043 --> 00:14:22,443
[Yaone] Get back!

195
00:14:22,543 --> 00:14:24,476
I'm sorry, Kougaiji,

196
00:14:24,576 --> 00:14:28,309
I wasn't able to repay you.
I'm so sorry.

197
00:14:32,076 --> 00:14:34,176
Hey! What are you doing?!

198
00:14:37,309 --> 00:14:38,743
[Kanan] Gonou...

199
00:14:38,843 --> 00:14:41,176
Gonou, listen to me.

200
00:14:41,276 --> 00:14:46,443
How can I let this child be
born? You know what a monster
his father is.

201
00:14:49,409 --> 00:14:50,476
[Hakkai] Kanan...

202
00:14:51,243 --> 00:14:53,843
Goodbye, Gonou. Goodbye.

203
00:14:56,176 --> 00:14:58,676
Kougaiji, I'm so sorry.

204
00:14:58,776 --> 00:14:59,909
STOP!

205
00:15:14,643 --> 00:15:16,543
You... You saved me...

206
00:15:17,943 --> 00:15:20,776
<i>[Sanzo] That's him... Kougaiji!</i>

207
00:15:26,743 --> 00:15:29,076
So this is the Sanzo party?
Not impressed.

208
00:15:30,743 --> 00:15:32,843
Me neither.

209
00:15:32,943 --> 00:15:35,443
[Kougaiji] I've come to retrieve
my associate.

210
00:15:35,543 --> 00:15:36,709
That's all.

211
00:15:39,309 --> 00:15:42,276
I have a feeling we'll be seeing
eachother again.

212
00:15:42,376 --> 00:15:46,209
I suggest you try staying alive
until then, if you can.

213
00:15:46,309 --> 00:15:49,343
Don't go. Stick around awhile.

214
00:16:00,809 --> 00:16:02,143
Goku! No!

215
00:16:09,709 --> 00:16:11,776
Stop it. It's embarassing.

216
00:16:11,876 --> 00:16:14,476
[mocking] "Stop it." I hate
this guy.

217
00:16:15,676 --> 00:16:17,843
And before you try anything...

218
00:16:29,776 --> 00:16:31,243
That's enough.

219
00:16:35,409 --> 00:16:38,076
[Kougaiji] How nice of you to
come up here and join us.

220
00:16:38,176 --> 00:16:40,309
[Sanzo] Yeah well I'm all
about service.

221
00:16:40,409 --> 00:16:43,743
You know what's pressing against
the back of your head right?

222
00:16:43,843 --> 00:16:45,876
Yeah, I know what it is, priest.

223
00:16:47,543 --> 00:16:51,309
I've got a lot of questions for
you, Your Highness.

224
00:16:51,409 --> 00:16:55,376
I'll bet you do, and believe me
I got all your answers.

225
00:16:55,476 --> 00:16:59,643
But if you want 'em, you're
gonna have to take them and
that could make things messy.

226
00:16:59,743 --> 00:17:02,909
[Kougaiji] You know, you've all
been pretty luck so far.

227
00:17:03,009 --> 00:17:06,876
But you and your little friends
might want to ask yourselves
a question,

228
00:17:06,976 --> 00:17:09,743
namly how long you think that
luck is going to last.

229
00:17:09,843 --> 00:17:15,409
Look, hair-do, I'm in a bad mood
so if you could just cut to the
chase, I'd appreciate it.

230
00:17:16,943 --> 00:17:18,543
Let the chase begin.

231
00:17:22,243 --> 00:17:24,043
Goddamnit!

232
00:17:24,143 --> 00:17:26,043
<i>I should have just shot him.</i>

233
00:17:29,909 --> 00:17:32,143
Are you all right, Goku?

234
00:17:33,509 --> 00:17:35,676
[Goku] He's powerful!

235
00:17:35,776 --> 00:17:40,209
He's super powerful! Oh shit,
this kicks ass!

236
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:41,843
He's smiling...

237
00:17:41,943 --> 00:17:45,209
Looks like monkey boy's happy
to finally have met our
little playmate.

238
00:17:45,309 --> 00:17:47,743
Now we have a face to match
the name.

239
00:17:47,843 --> 00:17:52,209
Yep. I can't wait to see that
face again and wipe that smirk
right off.

240
00:17:52,309 --> 00:17:55,743
Let's hope our next little
meeting provides more
information.

241
00:17:55,843 --> 00:17:59,376
Well, I think we found out what
we need to know now.

242
00:18:01,109 --> 00:18:04,209
It's no wonder the demons follow
him he's incredibly powerful,

243
00:18:04,309 --> 00:18:07,009
and he'll risk his life to save
one of his own.

244
00:18:10,109 --> 00:18:11,809
[Kougaiji] Are you hurt?

245
00:18:11,943 --> 00:18:15,309
[Yaone] No, I am all right.

246
00:18:15,409 --> 00:18:18,843
I'm so very sorry, my lord!
I failed you.

247
00:18:20,409 --> 00:18:23,843
This was my idea and I failed,
and now they know who you are.

248
00:18:25,476 --> 00:18:29,476
I'm a weakling. I don't know
why you save me, you should
have just-

249
00:18:29,576 --> 00:18:31,276
[Kougaiji] Shut up!

250
00:18:31,376 --> 00:18:34,109
When I enlisted you in my
service I don't recall you being

251
00:18:34,209 --> 00:18:37,343
stupid enough to throw you
life away!

252
00:18:37,443 --> 00:18:40,776
You promised me you'd follow me
to the ends of the Earth.

253
00:18:40,876 --> 00:18:42,976
Are you going to keep your word
or not?

254
00:18:45,376 --> 00:18:50,443
Of course. I will follow you
forever, to the ends of
the Earth.

255
00:18:52,043 --> 00:18:53,743
<i>Till the day I die.</i>

256
00:19:04,525 --> 00:19:05,825
[Sanzo] It's cold tonight.

257
00:19:06,958 --> 00:19:11,558
A little. It is a little.

258
00:19:13,025 --> 00:19:17,325
[Hakkai] It was cold the night I
met you, three years ago.

259
00:19:17,425 --> 00:19:20,225
Three years? I can't believe
it's only been three.

260
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:23,358
No offence, but it feels like
it's been a hell of a lot
longer than that.

261
00:19:23,458 --> 00:19:24,891
[Hakkai chuckles]

262
00:19:24,991 --> 00:19:26,425
None taken.

263
00:19:27,691 --> 00:19:31,091
A lot of shit's happened that
makes the years seem longer.

264
00:19:31,191 --> 00:19:34,891
And to be honest there's a lot
of shit I'd just as soon forget.

265
00:19:34,991 --> 00:19:39,058
Hakkai, if you feel you have
to go take care of some
unfinished business,

266
00:19:39,158 --> 00:19:43,158
I want you to go do what you
have to do and don't look back.
I mean that.

267
00:19:43,258 --> 00:19:47,425
You don't have to go with us.
You follow your own path.

268
00:19:47,525 --> 00:19:51,291
Just make sure revenge is a
path you want to take.

269
00:19:51,391 --> 00:19:55,458
I want to be here. I have no
idea where this road is going,

270
00:19:55,591 --> 00:19:57,958
but I know that I'm meant to be
on it.

271
00:19:58,058 --> 00:19:58,625
You know?

272
00:19:58,725 --> 00:19:59,725
[Door slams open]

273
00:19:59,825 --> 00:20:02,991
Sanzo, grab your shit! We're
changing rooms!

274
00:20:03,091 --> 00:20:06,491
Him! He drew picture on my feet
while I was sleeping!

275
00:20:06,591 --> 00:20:10,025
I couldn't sleep with your
snoring. What else was I
suppose to do?

276
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:13,225
[Goku] Don't ever touch my feet!
No, don't touch any part of me!

277
00:20:13,325 --> 00:20:14,891
[Gojyo] Touch you? Dude, I don't
wanna be in the same room
with you!

278
00:20:15,925 --> 00:20:17,591
[Goku] You're no dream date
either, Violet.

279
00:20:17,691 --> 00:20:19,791
[Gojyo] I could maybe put up
with the snoring but you fart
in your sleep too.

280
00:20:19,891 --> 00:20:21,425
[Sanzo] That's it!
That's enough!
[Goku] That's a lie!

281
00:20:21,525 --> 00:20:24,258
I'm not changing rooms with
anyone, so shut up!

282
00:20:24,358 --> 00:20:26,191
And if you don't shut up,
I'll shut you up!

283
00:20:26,291 --> 00:20:28,758
[Both] [mocking] Oh no! We're
so scared!

284
00:20:28,891 --> 00:20:31,458
[Hakkai] OK, I'll stay, but I
want you to know that
[Goku] What's that smell?!
Gross! You stink!

285
00:20:31,558 --> 00:20:33,625
[Hakkai] I reserve the right to
walk at any time I deem fit.
[Goku] Why don't you ever take
a bath?!

286
00:20:33,725 --> 00:20:35,391
[Gojyo] I take baths!
[Goku] No you don't! I've never
seen you!

287
00:20:35,491 --> 00:20:37,391
[Sanzo] Just take me with you.
[Goku] Bet I know why!

288
00:20:37,491 --> 00:20:38,458
[Gojyo] No you don't!

289
00:20:38,558 --> 00:20:40,558
[Goku] Oh yes I do! You're a
water sprite,

290
00:20:40,658 --> 00:20:43,225
and you're afriad of the water!
You can't even swim!

291
00:20:43,325 --> 00:20:45,825
[Gojyo] Shut up!
[Goku] Oh that's so lame,
you suck!

292
00:20:45,925 --> 00:20:47,525
[Goku] Really dude,
you just suck!

293
00:20:47,625 --> 00:20:48,791
[Gojyo] I'm gonna kick your ass.

294
00:20:48,891 --> 00:20:50,925
[Hakkai] Ladies, ladies please.

295
00:22:27,825 --> 00:22:31,958
[Goku] I'd love to tell you
that as our journey west
continues things get
easier for us.

296
00:22:32,058 --> 00:22:37,091
Not the case, I'm afraid. And
if having to fight pissed off
demons wasn't bad enough,

297
00:22:37,191 --> 00:22:40,058
we find out we might not even be
able to trust our friends.

298
00:22:40,158 --> 00:22:44,591
Although, to be honest, it's
not like we have a lot of those
in the first place.

299
00:22:44,691 --> 00:22:49,158
No matter. Just be sure not
to miss the next adventure
of Saiyuki!
