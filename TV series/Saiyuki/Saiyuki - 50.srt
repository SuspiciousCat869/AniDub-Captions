1
00:01:40,281 --> 00:01:41,147
[Goku] Sanzo...

2
00:01:45,947 --> 00:01:48,181
I want to be the
one to defeat him.

3
00:01:57,147 --> 00:01:58,447
Thanks, Sanzo.

4
00:02:06,614 --> 00:02:10,514
[Homura] Even now, you can't see
the beauty of what I'm doing.

5
00:02:23,681 --> 00:02:25,214
You're going down!

6
00:02:26,414 --> 00:02:27,347
Aaaaagh!

7
00:02:32,347 --> 00:02:33,381
You're mine!

8
00:02:35,414 --> 00:02:36,181
My god...

9
00:02:40,214 --> 00:02:40,914
Yeah!

10
00:02:48,181 --> 00:02:52,481
[Homura] <i>Good thing I turned</i>
<i>my head. A direct punch would</i>
<i>have been the end of me.</i>

11
00:02:52,581 --> 00:02:55,614
[Goku] <i>Nice dodge,</i>
<i>chakra boy. [laughs]</i>

12
00:02:58,247 --> 00:03:02,147
I see that you've been
working on that right.

13
00:03:02,247 --> 00:03:05,247
Well... you'll be
some fun after all!

14
00:03:06,514 --> 00:03:07,414
[Goku] Hah!

15
00:03:13,281 --> 00:03:14,947
[Goku] "Forever Westward"

16
00:03:25,547 --> 00:03:26,781
[Gojyo] How you doing, buddy?

17
00:03:30,414 --> 00:03:33,047
[Hakkai] I'm just
managing to stay conscious.

18
00:03:33,147 --> 00:03:35,981
[Gojyo] Don't think I'm
carrying you if you faint on me.

19
00:03:36,081 --> 00:03:38,814
I'll leave you behind
like I did my brother.

20
00:03:38,914 --> 00:03:40,614
[Hakkai] Believe me, I know.

21
00:03:42,114 --> 00:03:44,114
[Hakkai] By the way...

22
00:03:44,214 --> 00:03:49,314
I'm willing to bet
I'm the first guy you've
ever held in your arms.

23
00:03:49,414 --> 00:03:51,514
That's right.
Never again.

24
00:03:54,847 --> 00:03:58,947
Well then... I guess
we better be on our way.

25
00:04:01,447 --> 00:04:03,614
[Gojyo] Save the
world and all that...

26
00:04:12,347 --> 00:04:13,014
Son Goku...

27
00:04:14,147 --> 00:04:17,214
It's time to close the book...

28
00:04:18,647 --> 00:04:21,081
on your little fantasy!

29
00:04:29,414 --> 00:04:32,881
Ha! You've got the
wrong ending, pal!

30
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:41,914
Huh!?

31
00:04:48,081 --> 00:04:48,881
Ahh...!

32
00:05:12,581 --> 00:05:13,681
[Pants]

33
00:05:19,747 --> 00:05:21,147
[Sanzo] Did you have fun?

34
00:05:22,014 --> 00:05:23,014
[Goku sighs heavily]

35
00:05:27,014 --> 00:05:30,081
Ah, man, am I starving!

36
00:05:30,181 --> 00:05:34,247
[Sanzo] Heh, I'll buy you a
meat bun once we're out of here.

37
00:05:34,347 --> 00:05:36,314
[Hakkai] It seems
I'm late again.

38
00:05:36,414 --> 00:05:37,714
[Goku] Huh?

39
00:05:37,814 --> 00:05:41,414
Don't tell me I
missed all the fireworks...

40
00:05:41,514 --> 00:05:44,481
That must have been one
hell of a fight, Goku.

41
00:05:44,581 --> 00:05:46,447
[Goku] Gojyo! Hakkai!

42
00:05:46,547 --> 00:05:49,747
[Gojyo] Heh, I would
have made it if I wasn't
hauling your ass around.

43
00:05:49,847 --> 00:05:54,281
[Hakkai] Sanzo... we
can't just leave things
as they are, can we?

44
00:05:55,881 --> 00:05:57,014
I guess not.

45
00:06:04,481 --> 00:06:07,314
I'm putting an
end to this right now.

46
00:06:43,981 --> 00:06:45,047
Let's go.

47
00:06:45,681 --> 00:06:46,314
[Homura] Wait...

48
00:06:46,414 --> 00:06:47,081
[Goku] Huh!?

49
00:06:49,214 --> 00:06:54,114
[Homura laughs] Don't
be in such a hurry.

50
00:06:55,281 --> 00:06:57,347
It's not over just yet...

51
00:07:01,014 --> 00:07:03,614
[Sanzo] <i>Damn it.</i>
<i>That bastard's smiling.</i>

52
00:07:08,014 --> 00:07:09,447
You will all pay...

53
00:07:11,647 --> 00:07:15,014
for the sin of
destroying my future.

54
00:07:17,547 --> 00:07:18,247
What?!

55
00:07:19,581 --> 00:07:22,347
I've been restrained
for far too long now.

56
00:07:23,147 --> 00:07:26,514
Are you ready, Son Goku?

57
00:07:26,614 --> 00:07:29,981
Yeah. Everybody stand back!

58
00:07:30,081 --> 00:07:31,314
Goku...?

59
00:07:31,414 --> 00:07:33,881
I won't let you
hog all the glory!

60
00:07:34,014 --> 00:07:35,014
[Sanzo] Oh, shove it.

61
00:07:35,981 --> 00:07:37,881
You'll just slow Goku down.

62
00:07:38,981 --> 00:07:41,314
You may be right, Sanzo, but...

63
00:07:41,414 --> 00:07:42,581
Have it your way.

64
00:07:56,614 --> 00:08:00,614
Are you ready
for your atonement?

65
00:08:30,222 --> 00:08:30,922
[Roars] Hyahhh...!

66
00:08:33,588 --> 00:08:35,088
[Homura laughs]

67
00:08:57,588 --> 00:08:58,522
[Goku] Aauh...!

68
00:09:00,008 --> 00:09:03,642
[Hamura] Don't die on me.
I haven't even started.

69
00:09:10,375 --> 00:09:11,275
[Laughs]

70
00:09:12,375 --> 00:09:13,542
Goku!

71
00:09:13,642 --> 00:09:17,475
Hey, guys, maybe we
should help him out...

72
00:09:17,608 --> 00:09:22,442
I see. So this is
the kind of power a
War God is capable of.

73
00:09:22,542 --> 00:09:24,375
Nope. That's coming.

74
00:09:26,742 --> 00:09:28,508
[Homura grunts]

75
00:09:30,475 --> 00:09:36,175
[Laughs] See? Isn't this
fun, Son Goku? I could keep
going like this forever!

76
00:09:37,975 --> 00:09:39,442
[Homura] Nngh! Hm?

77
00:09:44,408 --> 00:09:45,308
[Homura groans]

78
00:09:47,175 --> 00:09:49,875
Homura...are... you okay?

79
00:10:04,275 --> 00:10:05,675
[Goku] San... Sanzo...

80
00:10:07,508 --> 00:10:11,342
So tell me. What are you
holding yourself back for?

81
00:10:14,942 --> 00:10:16,575
[Hamura groans] Holding back...?

82
00:10:17,808 --> 00:10:20,242
[Sanzo] Why not give
him exactly what he wants?

83
00:10:21,975 --> 00:10:22,808
What's that?

84
00:10:26,775 --> 00:10:30,775
So what do you think
he means by that?

85
00:10:30,875 --> 00:10:33,275
Sanzo... you don't think...

86
00:10:34,042 --> 00:10:35,375
[Hakkai] Hamura is...

87
00:10:39,975 --> 00:10:44,608
[Homura] <i>Damn it, not</i>
<i>yet! Not yet! I'm not</i>
<i>through with him yet.</i>

88
00:10:53,875 --> 00:10:54,808
Hey, Sanzo!

89
00:10:56,242 --> 00:10:59,208
Don't worry... He's looking for
a place to die.

90
00:10:59,308 --> 00:11:00,775
Place to die?

91
00:11:00,875 --> 00:11:03,608
Hmph! I'm ready
for you, Goku.

92
00:11:07,508 --> 00:11:10,875
Alright! Give me your
all! Don't hold back!

93
00:11:31,708 --> 00:11:34,942
A worthy opponent
after all...

94
00:11:36,442 --> 00:11:37,342
[Groans]

95
00:11:39,775 --> 00:11:40,442
...that's good.

96
00:11:40,542 --> 00:11:41,275
[gasps]

97
00:11:44,442 --> 00:11:45,408
What's that!?

98
00:11:47,908 --> 00:11:49,175
Now die, Konzen!

99
00:11:49,275 --> 00:11:50,175
Nooo...!

100
00:12:09,408 --> 00:12:10,475
[Goku] Homura!

101
00:12:12,508 --> 00:12:16,775
Why you bastard! You didn't
dodge that on purpose!

102
00:12:16,875 --> 00:12:20,742
No... you defeated
me fair and square.

103
00:12:23,342 --> 00:12:28,008
And I... must admit that
I... enjoyed the fight.

104
00:12:29,108 --> 00:12:30,142
You liar!

105
00:12:32,242 --> 00:12:35,708
I'm grateful, Son Goku.

106
00:12:38,075 --> 00:12:39,308
[Goku] Don't die!

107
00:12:44,042 --> 00:12:44,842
Homura...

108
00:12:47,408 --> 00:12:48,342
[Homura] Konzen...

109
00:12:53,208 --> 00:12:54,142
[Homura] It's over.

110
00:12:56,608 --> 00:12:57,542
[Homura] All of it.

111
00:12:59,875 --> 00:13:03,075
[Homura] I wanted so badly to
see it happen before I died.

112
00:13:05,842 --> 00:13:09,175
[Homura] But the human blood in
my veins caught up with me.

113
00:13:10,542 --> 00:13:12,242
You're part human!?

114
00:13:12,975 --> 00:13:15,108
So you are a mortal!

115
00:13:15,208 --> 00:13:17,442
That's right...

116
00:13:17,542 --> 00:13:23,042
I'm a heretical being. I'm an
outcast in the heavens.

117
00:13:25,642 --> 00:13:29,575
[Homura] There was no
way I'd let myself die
in that miserable place.

118
00:13:31,242 --> 00:13:33,842
[Homura] But I... am
still a War God.

119
00:13:35,408 --> 00:13:37,675
And I will die in battle.

120
00:13:37,775 --> 00:13:40,875
That's why I picked you.

121
00:13:40,975 --> 00:13:45,708
If I... was to fall, I wanted it
to be by your hand.

122
00:13:47,808 --> 00:13:51,542
It's an honor... Son Goku.

123
00:13:53,375 --> 00:13:58,608
[Homura] You are the only
warrior I found worthy of
besting a War God.

124
00:14:01,942 --> 00:14:02,708
Homura...

125
00:14:04,142 --> 00:14:06,008
[Homura] Konzen...

126
00:14:06,108 --> 00:14:11,808
[Homura] Konzen, I know
I'm in no position to ask
you for anything...

127
00:14:14,475 --> 00:14:18,208
but I would like my body to
be sealed away in here...

128
00:14:19,575 --> 00:14:23,442
so that it may travel on with
the passing of this world.

129
00:14:24,742 --> 00:14:25,675
You know...

130
00:14:27,208 --> 00:14:31,608
when you left... five hundred
years ago,many of us...

131
00:14:32,742 --> 00:14:35,508
yearned to have made
the voyage with you.

132
00:14:39,375 --> 00:14:42,475
Ugh... Knowing that
you'll die some day...

133
00:14:43,642 --> 00:14:47,175
gives you the courage
to live your own life.

134
00:14:49,575 --> 00:14:52,642
[Homura] Since I've come
down to the Lower World,

135
00:14:52,742 --> 00:14:56,475
I'd like to think that,
for however briefly,

136
00:14:56,575 --> 00:14:59,075
I lived the way you guys have...

137
00:15:00,575 --> 00:15:02,208
without regrets.

138
00:15:12,008 --> 00:15:13,442
[Exhales]

139
00:15:38,542 --> 00:15:41,108
I've been wanting to
beat him for so long.

140
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:48,008
But now... I feel... like
I'm the one who lost.

141
00:15:48,108 --> 00:15:52,508
[Hakkai] Actually, you could say
he did win, in a way.

142
00:15:52,608 --> 00:15:58,342
I mean, everything turned out
exactly the way Hamura wanted
it to turn out, didn't it?

143
00:16:00,375 --> 00:16:06,075
[Goku] No... no! No, no, no, no!

144
00:16:06,175 --> 00:16:09,575
[Goku] No, no, no!
[Sanzo] Goku, calm down
and look at him...

145
00:16:10,842 --> 00:16:12,742
Huh?

146
00:16:12,842 --> 00:16:15,642
[Gojyo] He looks so...
peaceful, doesn't he?

147
00:16:15,742 --> 00:16:18,908
[Sanzo] If you see the
Buddha, kill the Buddha.

148
00:16:19,008 --> 00:16:21,308
[Sanzo] If you meet your
father, kill your father.

149
00:16:22,575 --> 00:16:27,808
Free of everything, you
are bound by nothing.

150
00:16:27,908 --> 00:16:30,008
[Sanzo] Live the life
that is given to you.

151
00:16:36,142 --> 00:16:37,175
[Goku] Right...

152
00:16:41,108 --> 00:16:45,008
I don't get it... but I do!

153
00:16:45,108 --> 00:16:47,442
[Gojyo] Come again?
[Hakkai chuckles]

154
00:16:47,542 --> 00:16:49,742
What's so funny? I don't get it!

155
00:16:55,675 --> 00:16:56,842
Sanzo!

156
00:16:56,942 --> 00:17:04,675
[Whispering inaudible chants]

157
00:17:06,175 --> 00:17:08,642
[Sanzo] Makai Tenjou!

158
00:17:22,575 --> 00:17:24,775
[Jiroushin] So,
it's finally over.

159
00:17:24,875 --> 00:17:26,742
[Merciful Goddess] Whatever
do you mean, Jiroushin?

160
00:17:26,842 --> 00:17:28,642
[Jiroushin] Lady?

161
00:17:28,742 --> 00:17:31,508
[Merciful Goddess]
Sanzo and his party are
still heading westward.

162
00:17:32,742 --> 00:17:34,542
Yes, I forgot.

163
00:17:36,408 --> 00:17:39,575
[Merciful Goddess] <i>The</i>
<i>journey of life never</i>
<i>really ends, does it?</i>

164
00:17:39,708 --> 00:17:43,275
<i>Just as sure as nothing ever</i>
<i>changes in the heavens...</i>

165
00:17:43,375 --> 00:17:47,842
<i>So, Sanzo and his ragtag crew</i>
<i>will continue heading West,</i>

166
00:17:47,942 --> 00:17:53,008
<i>with only their strength</i>
<i>and will to guide them as they</i>
<i>carve out their own destiny.</i>

167
00:18:05,342 --> 00:18:09,475
Isn't that right? Hm, Nataku?

168
00:18:09,575 --> 00:18:13,008
[Merciful Goddess] Life is about
the voyage, not the destination.

169
00:18:21,608 --> 00:18:23,675
I got the scripture back...

170
00:18:23,775 --> 00:18:25,775
Uh, woah, what're you doing?

171
00:18:28,642 --> 00:18:30,108
What, do you want a medal?

172
00:18:37,642 --> 00:18:40,208
[Koushu] Find me a
way to revive Gyumaoh.

173
00:18:40,308 --> 00:18:44,208
[Huang] All the equipment
is damaged. It takes time.

174
00:18:44,308 --> 00:18:49,375
[Wang laughs] After all,
it's been turned off for
quite a while now.

175
00:18:49,475 --> 00:18:53,575
[Ni] It could take... much
longer than anticipated.

176
00:18:59,775 --> 00:19:02,642
Ha! You can't catch me! Tee-hee!

177
00:19:04,908 --> 00:19:08,542
Hey, come back here!
You aren't supposed to
be outside the castle!

178
00:19:09,242 --> 00:19:10,375
[Lirin] Slow poke!

179
00:19:12,175 --> 00:19:13,308
[Yawns]

180
00:19:40,969 --> 00:19:42,703
Can't get to sleep, eh?

181
00:19:42,803 --> 00:19:44,036
You kidding?

182
00:19:45,703 --> 00:19:48,103
When the stars look like this?

183
00:19:48,203 --> 00:19:50,436
Yeah, you're right.

184
00:19:50,536 --> 00:19:52,969
I just saw the first
shooting star of my life,

185
00:19:53,069 --> 00:19:55,503
and if I was asleep I
would have missed it.

186
00:19:55,636 --> 00:19:58,969
Please don't make a
wish. That's so lame.

187
00:19:59,069 --> 00:20:00,469
Aw, come on...

188
00:20:00,569 --> 00:20:04,503
I wish I may, I wish
I might... Did it work?

189
00:20:04,603 --> 00:20:06,803
I dunno. Did you
wish I hated you?

190
00:20:06,903 --> 00:20:10,669
[Goku mutters] Hold me...
sweet meat bun...

191
00:20:10,769 --> 00:20:15,769
[Gojyo] Geeze... can you
believe this guy? He's even
annoying when he's sleeping!

192
00:20:15,869 --> 00:20:19,336
I wish the little
bastard's pea-sized brain
came with an off switch.

193
00:20:19,436 --> 00:20:21,736
Now, don't you go waking him...

194
00:20:21,836 --> 00:20:25,636
[Gojyo] As if that's
even possible.
[Goku snores loudly]

195
00:20:25,736 --> 00:20:29,403
Y'know, Gojyo, my old friend,
I really envy people who can

196
00:20:29,503 --> 00:20:32,336
come up with something
to wish for on the spot.

197
00:20:32,436 --> 00:20:35,369
I can't think of a single
thing I'm yearning for.

198
00:20:37,969 --> 00:20:39,703
That's just, you know...

199
00:20:45,769 --> 00:20:49,269
because you've already got
everything that you want.

200
00:21:15,703 --> 00:21:18,436
[Hakkai] Y'know Gojyo,
I guess you're right.

201
00:21:26,936 --> 00:21:31,736
Augh! You ate my
emergency food rations!
You cruel, evil bastard!

202
00:21:31,836 --> 00:21:33,569
I didn't see your name on it!

203
00:21:33,669 --> 00:21:37,569
[Goku] How do you put your name
on freeze dried squid, dumbass!?

204
00:21:37,669 --> 00:21:39,536
[Gojyo] If there was
any left, I'd show you!

205
00:21:39,636 --> 00:21:42,536
[Goku] How 'bout I cram
my fist down your throat
and get them back!?

206
00:21:42,636 --> 00:21:44,603
[Gojyo] Just you try!
I'll bite your arm off!

207
00:21:44,703 --> 00:21:48,769
[Goku] Yeah, that's
right! Bite me, you big
purple-haired stupid head!

208
00:21:48,869 --> 00:21:51,203
[Goku] I mean it!
I'll kick your ass!
[Sanzo] Shut up!

209
00:21:51,303 --> 00:21:53,169
[Gojyo] You talking to me?
He's the one who's yelling!

210
00:21:53,269 --> 00:21:55,869
[Goku yelling] I am not!
[Gojyo] Are too!

211
00:21:55,969 --> 00:21:58,536
[Sanzo yelling] No, I
am! You want to die!?

212
00:21:58,636 --> 00:22:00,203
[Goku] Stop it, Gojyo!
[Hakkai laughing]

213
00:22:00,303 --> 00:22:01,303
[Gojyo] That was Sanzo!

214
00:22:01,403 --> 00:22:02,903
[Goku] Stop blaming it on him!

215
00:22:03,003 --> 00:22:04,503
[Gunshot]

216
00:22:04,603 --> 00:22:06,203
[Sanzo] Knock it off!
