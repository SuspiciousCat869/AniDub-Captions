1
00:01:50,462 --> 00:01:52,128
I'm so stuffed!

2
00:01:53,895 --> 00:01:58,795
I never thought I'd live to
hear those words pass
through your lips, Goku.

3
00:01:58,895 --> 00:02:01,828
It's been a while since we
had a proper meal.

4
00:02:01,928 --> 00:02:05,428
Well I'm full. What do we
do now, huh?

5
00:02:05,528 --> 00:02:10,095
We'll find somewhere to stay for
tonight and then we'll head out
first thing in morning.

6
00:02:10,195 --> 00:02:12,295
Then first, we should look for
a hotel.

7
00:02:12,395 --> 00:02:17,595
We're in luck, I believe there's
a very nice one in the back of
this very restaurant.

8
00:02:17,695 --> 00:02:19,195
Well then...

9
00:02:19,895 --> 00:02:21,795
Gojyo, something wrong?

10
00:02:21,895 --> 00:02:25,095
[Gojyo] We don't leave till
tomorrow, we've already picked
an inn.

11
00:02:25,195 --> 00:02:27,462
So there's only one thing left
to do.

12
00:02:27,562 --> 00:02:29,662
Eat a meal.

13
00:02:31,528 --> 00:02:33,662
Fool! Damn moronic monkey!

14
00:02:33,795 --> 00:02:37,762
Can't you ever talk about
anything else?! You're
driving me crazy!

15
00:02:38,862 --> 00:02:44,495
Cruisin'... Cruisin' for chicks.

16
00:02:47,262 --> 00:02:49,395
"Sweet Child of Mine."

17
00:02:55,962 --> 00:02:57,262
[Hakkai] You're just letting
him go?

18
00:02:57,362 --> 00:02:59,228
Yeah sure, why shouldn't I?

19
00:02:59,328 --> 00:03:04,095
Hey, Hakkai, why don't we use
our night off to go shopping?

20
00:03:04,195 --> 00:03:05,628
[Hakkai] That Sounds good.

21
00:03:05,728 --> 00:03:09,162
We've needed to pick up some
more supplies for awhile
now, let's go.

22
00:03:09,262 --> 00:03:11,362
Woohoo!

23
00:03:11,462 --> 00:03:15,628
Hey, I'm running low on
cigarettes, so why don't you
pick up a carton for me?

24
00:03:15,728 --> 00:03:19,162
And just because this a borrowed
ATM card,

25
00:03:19,262 --> 00:03:22,295
doesn't mean you should waste it
on getting food for Goku.

26
00:03:22,395 --> 00:03:23,662
Tightass!

27
00:03:25,828 --> 00:03:28,995
[Gojyo] Let's see if any women
meet my standards.

28
00:03:32,062 --> 00:03:35,862
Classy... But she'd expect a
call in the morning.

29
00:03:35,962 --> 00:03:39,428
No bad, dig the attitude, file
her under maybe.

30
00:03:41,828 --> 00:03:48,395
Oh boy, you will pay for the
privlage of having those jewels
hang around your neck in public.

31
00:03:48,495 --> 00:03:51,962
They'd expect you to pay for
this and that, and then
what happens?

32
00:03:52,062 --> 00:03:55,595
They act all high and mighty
and boss you around.

33
00:03:58,895 --> 00:04:00,462
What the hell is that?!

34
00:04:00,562 --> 00:04:02,628
Do they think they look cute
dressed that way?

35
00:04:02,728 --> 00:04:05,628
They're the type that put
sugar in your gas tank if
you dump them.

36
00:04:05,728 --> 00:04:06,895
I hate that.

37
00:04:10,328 --> 00:04:11,895
I wish I hadn't thought
about that.

38
00:04:13,962 --> 00:04:15,228
Oops, sorry, man.

39
00:04:15,895 --> 00:04:17,662
Hold it right there.

40
00:04:20,262 --> 00:04:22,728
Hey look a fight!

41
00:04:22,828 --> 00:04:25,695
[Man 1] The skinny guy's about
to get his ass kicked. Come on!

42
00:04:28,662 --> 00:04:30,428
[Thug] I can't believe it.

43
00:04:30,528 --> 00:04:33,028
You bumped into me on purpose.

44
00:04:33,128 --> 00:04:35,662
I think you broke my arm.

45
00:04:36,762 --> 00:04:40,228
[Gojyo] Oh man, you've got to be
kidding me.

46
00:04:40,328 --> 00:04:44,195
That's best excuse you can up
with to pick a fight?

47
00:04:44,295 --> 00:04:48,895
Heh. I like you, I just may let
you walk out of here.

48
00:04:48,995 --> 00:04:53,128
With some broken bones, if you
give me all your money.

49
00:04:53,228 --> 00:04:56,095
[Gojyo] Aw come on now, are we
going to do this or what?

50
00:04:56,195 --> 00:05:00,128
Look, stop your blabbing will
ya? I'm sort of in a hurry.

51
00:05:02,628 --> 00:05:06,195
No one... makes fun of me!

52
00:05:07,262 --> 00:05:08,828
Too slow, baldy!

53
00:05:13,462 --> 00:05:16,962
[Gojyo] I've got no time to
waste on educating meat heads.

54
00:05:31,928 --> 00:05:33,062
[Gojyo] What the?

55
00:05:35,295 --> 00:05:36,428
Hello there!

56
00:05:46,595 --> 00:05:49,695
[Gojyo] Look, I'm sure you're
very nice and all but,

57
00:05:49,795 --> 00:05:55,028
you see, I'm just not ready for
that level commitment at the
moment. Okay?

58
00:05:55,595 --> 00:05:57,428
Okay.

59
00:05:57,528 --> 00:06:00,295
[Gojyo] I'm glad we can both be
adults about this.

60
00:06:00,395 --> 00:06:01,228
So long!

61
00:06:01,328 --> 00:06:02,962
Hey, wait a second, Mister!

62
00:06:03,062 --> 00:06:04,928
I have something important to
tell you.

63
00:06:07,762 --> 00:06:09,828
I really like you.

64
00:06:29,628 --> 00:06:34,862
<i>What luck. First I run into</i>
<i>some moron and now I got this</i>
<i>bugar eater chasing after me.</i>

65
00:06:34,962 --> 00:06:36,595
<i>Could it get any worse?</i>

66
00:06:37,895 --> 00:06:40,028
Will you please stop
following me?!

67
00:06:40,128 --> 00:06:44,728
Nuh-uh! I'm going to follow you
around all day until you listen
to what I have to say!

68
00:06:47,895 --> 00:06:49,028
Hey!

69
00:06:51,362 --> 00:06:53,628
<i>Just how am I suppose to</i>
<i>pick up chicks with that</i>
<i>baggage around?</i>

70
00:06:53,728 --> 00:06:55,195
[Meihou] Wait!

71
00:06:55,528 --> 00:06:56,295
Wait!

72
00:06:56,395 --> 00:06:58,262
Wait for me!
[crashing]

73
00:06:58,362 --> 00:06:59,362
[Gojyo] Go away!

74
00:06:59,462 --> 00:07:00,495
[Meihou] Where are you going?

75
00:07:00,628 --> 00:07:01,762
[Gojyo] Away from you?

76
00:07:01,862 --> 00:07:03,262
[Meihou] What are you doing
in there?

77
00:07:03,362 --> 00:07:04,662
[Gojyo] For crying out loud!

78
00:07:04,762 --> 00:07:06,028
[Meihou] I can see you!

79
00:07:06,128 --> 00:07:07,228
[Gojyo] Ah!
[crashing]

80
00:07:07,328 --> 00:07:10,495
[Meihou] Wait! Wait, come back!

81
00:07:10,595 --> 00:07:12,728
[Gojyo running into something]

82
00:07:12,828 --> 00:07:14,095
Come back here!

83
00:07:18,962 --> 00:07:20,695
Looks like I gave her the slip.

84
00:07:25,395 --> 00:07:26,862
Hey there!

85
00:07:30,495 --> 00:07:32,328
Look here, missy...

86
00:07:32,428 --> 00:07:35,295
I'm not a missy. I'm Meihou.

87
00:07:35,395 --> 00:07:40,162
All right, Meihou, I'm going
to try asking you nicely,
like this,

88
00:07:40,262 --> 00:07:44,195
for the love of god, will you
please go and try to find
someone else to play with?

89
00:07:44,295 --> 00:07:45,828
Nuh-uh!

90
00:07:45,928 --> 00:07:48,862
Look, your Big Brother has
some really important business

91
00:07:48,962 --> 00:07:51,928
that he need to attend to
right away. Okay?

92
00:07:52,028 --> 00:07:55,095
What kind of business is it?

93
00:07:55,195 --> 00:07:57,762
I sort of have to find me
a date.

94
00:07:59,462 --> 00:08:02,628
I got an idea. Why don't I go on
a date with you!

95
00:08:03,595 --> 00:08:05,995
Maybe when you're just a little
bit older.

96
00:08:11,528 --> 00:08:12,962
[Goku] That's Gojyo...

97
00:08:17,562 --> 00:08:20,928
Why'd you stop here? What's the
big hold up?

98
00:08:21,028 --> 00:08:25,062
Go-Gojyo's gotten so desperate
he's resorted to picking up
underaged girls!

99
00:08:25,162 --> 00:08:26,795
Gojyo?

100
00:08:29,128 --> 00:08:29,728
Where?

101
00:08:29,828 --> 00:08:30,462
What the?

102
00:08:31,328 --> 00:08:32,395
You're crazy, nobody's there.

103
00:08:32,495 --> 00:08:35,428
I swear I saw him with a girl
about yea big.

104
00:08:35,528 --> 00:08:38,528
And they were walking together
holding hands.

105
00:08:38,628 --> 00:08:40,528
I just don't buy it.

106
00:08:40,662 --> 00:08:43,928
Look, he may not appear it, but
he's normal.

107
00:08:44,028 --> 00:08:45,462
You sure?

108
00:08:49,762 --> 00:08:52,195
Looks good!

109
00:08:52,295 --> 00:08:56,328
Here's the deal. You go home
as soon as you're done with
that, you got it?

110
00:08:56,428 --> 00:08:58,928
Okay, then I won't eat anymore!

111
00:08:59,028 --> 00:09:01,462
Aw come on!

112
00:09:07,128 --> 00:09:08,895
Oh, all right.

113
00:09:08,995 --> 00:09:10,795
Go ahead and eat it, it's okay.

114
00:09:11,262 --> 00:09:12,395
Yay!

115
00:09:19,195 --> 00:09:20,595
[Meihou] Hey, Mister?

116
00:09:22,195 --> 00:09:24,262
You never told me what your
name was.

117
00:09:24,362 --> 00:09:27,762
That so? My name is Gojyo.

118
00:09:27,862 --> 00:09:30,895
Gojyo, I'm Sha Gojyo.

119
00:09:35,128 --> 00:09:36,628
I don't like that name.

120
00:09:41,395 --> 00:09:42,762
[Meihou] Say, Gojyo?

121
00:09:45,695 --> 00:09:48,162
I want to ask you something
important, okay?

122
00:09:55,995 --> 00:09:58,162
Alright, you win.

123
00:09:58,262 --> 00:09:59,995
You'll listen?

124
00:10:00,095 --> 00:10:03,062
I don't think I have much of a
choice, do I?

125
00:10:04,628 --> 00:10:06,295
Here goes...

126
00:10:06,395 --> 00:10:09,562
I would like to hire your
services for a night, okay?

127
00:10:19,907 --> 00:10:23,307
Gojyo, I want to hire you for
the night, okay?

128
00:10:26,141 --> 00:10:29,041
[Gojyo] Do you even know what
that means?

129
00:10:29,141 --> 00:10:31,674
Gojyo, you are strong,
aren't you?

130
00:10:31,774 --> 00:10:34,874
Yeah, I do my best to stay
in shape.

131
00:10:34,974 --> 00:10:37,341
And that's exactly why I'd like
to hire you.

132
00:10:37,774 --> 00:10:39,107
Oh my god.

133
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:43,307
A guy like me isn't
cheap, honey.

134
00:10:45,407 --> 00:10:49,107
[Meihou] Okay, so I don't
have much,

135
00:10:49,207 --> 00:10:50,674
but I can give you this.

136
00:10:50,774 --> 00:10:53,074
But this is just a worthless
piece of-

137
00:10:58,874 --> 00:11:00,874
Okay, tell me what you want.

138
00:11:05,907 --> 00:11:08,074
[Meihou] Say, Mother?

139
00:11:08,174 --> 00:11:12,407
How long will it be before
we can stop at a town where
there are no demons?

140
00:11:12,507 --> 00:11:18,474
Hush. Don't worry, I'm sure
we'll find a safe place any
day now, baby.

141
00:11:18,574 --> 00:11:20,874
That's right, Meihou. So, let's
get some sleep.

142
00:11:21,374 --> 00:11:26,541
[Strange noises]

143
00:11:35,607 --> 00:11:38,574
[Mom] Don't come out of there,
understand?

144
00:11:38,674 --> 00:11:40,074
I understand.

145
00:11:40,174 --> 00:11:41,374
Don't make any noise.

146
00:11:41,474 --> 00:11:44,507
And in the morning, head into
town and don't look back.

147
00:11:44,607 --> 00:11:46,541
What about you?

148
00:11:46,641 --> 00:11:48,541
[Mom] I love you.
[Meihou] Mother!

149
00:11:48,641 --> 00:11:50,174
[Meihou] Mother!

150
00:12:09,641 --> 00:12:12,541
[Meihou] I told the townspeople,
but they didn't believe me.

151
00:12:12,641 --> 00:12:14,074
I don't know if it's because
I'm a kid,

152
00:12:14,174 --> 00:12:18,441
or because they're scared of
demons but they wouldn't
listen to me.

153
00:12:18,541 --> 00:12:21,974
I see now, why you were
so persistent.

154
00:12:23,241 --> 00:12:25,307
[Gojyo] Then shall we get going?

155
00:12:25,407 --> 00:12:28,241
You just bought yourself one
demon ass kicker.

156
00:12:31,407 --> 00:12:32,507
[Goku & Hakkai] We're back.

157
00:12:32,607 --> 00:12:35,607
Wow look, Gojyo still hasn't
made it back here yet.

158
00:12:35,707 --> 00:12:37,607
[Hakkai] Forgive us for being
so late.

159
00:12:37,741 --> 00:12:42,874
Goku's nagging me so much I
finally broke down and went
on a bit of a spending spree.

160
00:12:42,974 --> 00:12:44,907
That's okay. It's not my money.

161
00:12:47,541 --> 00:12:49,974
But more importantly, what did
you make of the place?

162
00:12:50,074 --> 00:12:53,374
[Hakkai] Seems peaceful enough,
lively too, but...

163
00:12:53,474 --> 00:12:54,307
But?

164
00:12:54,407 --> 00:12:56,574
[Hakkai] I did hear one rumor.

165
00:12:56,674 --> 00:12:58,807
[Sanzo] What rumor's that?

166
00:12:58,907 --> 00:13:00,807
[Hakkai] It sounds like some
demons have taken residence

167
00:13:00,907 --> 00:13:04,407
in the forest just a little west
of town.

168
00:13:04,507 --> 00:13:08,207
There's been quite a few reports
of some missing relatives.

169
00:13:08,307 --> 00:13:10,974
I'm betting it's the work of our
old friends.

170
00:13:11,074 --> 00:13:15,174
The dissapearences seem
to be occuring with greater
frequency I'm afraid.

171
00:13:15,274 --> 00:13:19,474
Hey! I saw something even
more disturbing!

172
00:13:19,574 --> 00:13:24,007
Gojyo was on a date with an itty
bitty girl this big!

173
00:13:24,741 --> 00:13:26,707
[Sanzo] Get out of here.

174
00:13:26,807 --> 00:13:29,707
I'm not passing judgement,
I'm just saying.

175
00:13:29,807 --> 00:13:31,741
What should we do?

176
00:13:31,841 --> 00:13:33,907
[Sanzo] The forest is
directly in our path.

177
00:13:34,007 --> 00:13:36,474
So we'll find out either way.

178
00:13:36,574 --> 00:13:38,974
Why don't I go out and ask
around a little more?

179
00:13:39,074 --> 00:13:40,241
See what I can find.

180
00:13:41,407 --> 00:13:42,541
[Sanzo] You do that.

181
00:13:44,374 --> 00:13:45,741
[Meihou] This is the place.

182
00:13:45,841 --> 00:13:48,274
The townspeople say this forest
is haunted by spirits,

183
00:13:48,374 --> 00:13:50,874
and no one dares to come
near it.

184
00:13:50,974 --> 00:13:55,474
[Gojyo] Spirits and demons, I
gotta tell ya, they're all the
same to me, honey.

185
00:13:56,407 --> 00:13:58,374
[Meihou] Gojyo...

186
00:13:58,474 --> 00:14:00,641
[Gojyo] So this is where your
family was attacked.

187
00:14:02,241 --> 00:14:03,941
I know you're here.

188
00:14:04,041 --> 00:14:04,941
What?

189
00:14:05,041 --> 00:14:06,707
Just talking to myself.

190
00:14:06,807 --> 00:14:08,141
Come on, let's go.

191
00:14:08,241 --> 00:14:10,741
But where are we going?

192
00:14:10,841 --> 00:14:12,707
Demon hideout.

193
00:14:19,107 --> 00:14:22,007
Are you ready to go take
a look, princess?

194
00:14:22,107 --> 00:14:23,907
Uh, I guess.

195
00:14:25,207 --> 00:14:27,607
[Gojyo] Hello? Anybody home?

196
00:14:27,707 --> 00:14:29,507
[Meihou] It looks abandoned.

197
00:14:35,841 --> 00:14:37,007
Wh-What is it?

198
00:14:37,107 --> 00:14:38,541
Something's not right.

199
00:14:38,641 --> 00:14:39,874
What's not right?

200
00:14:41,907 --> 00:14:46,074
<i>At first glance, it has all the</i>
<i>trappings of an ordinary home,</i>

201
00:14:46,174 --> 00:14:49,607
<i>but I feel like we've</i>
<i>been thrown into a</i>
<i>miniature dollhouse.</i>

202
00:14:49,707 --> 00:14:51,541
<i>And that demonic aura...</i>

203
00:14:51,674 --> 00:14:55,807
<i>It's reverberating through the</i>
<i>entire place so that I can't</i>
<i>locate it.</i>

204
00:14:57,341 --> 00:15:00,241
[Meihou] Gojyo, I'm scared.

205
00:15:01,441 --> 00:15:02,741
[Gojyo] Beyond the door?

206
00:15:05,541 --> 00:15:07,274
What the hell is that?!

207
00:15:07,374 --> 00:15:08,274
Let's go!

208
00:15:08,374 --> 00:15:14,574
[Demonic chuckling]

209
00:15:14,674 --> 00:15:15,774
[Meihou] It's them!
[Gojyo] No!

210
00:15:15,874 --> 00:15:18,341
[Meihou] Let me go!
[Gojyo] Calm down, Meihou!

211
00:15:18,441 --> 00:15:21,407
Check this out! Ah ha!

212
00:15:23,007 --> 00:15:27,074
[Demonic chuckling]

213
00:15:27,174 --> 00:15:30,141
Well, it looks like we're in the
whale's stomach so to speak.

214
00:15:30,241 --> 00:15:33,207
But first we have to find a way
out of here. You with me?

215
00:15:36,907 --> 00:15:38,041
[Meihou screams]

216
00:15:38,141 --> 00:15:39,507
This, I don't need.

217
00:15:39,607 --> 00:15:40,741
Move it!

218
00:15:43,774 --> 00:15:44,907
Get back!

219
00:15:46,641 --> 00:15:47,907
Eat this!

220
00:15:50,641 --> 00:15:52,907
Okay get ready to jump. Now!

221
00:15:57,774 --> 00:15:59,907
Man this thing is persistent!

222
00:16:00,007 --> 00:16:01,141
Look, Gojyo!

223
00:16:01,907 --> 00:16:03,074
[Meihou] he door!

224
00:16:03,174 --> 00:16:04,307
Damn!

225
00:16:07,607 --> 00:16:09,641
Gojyo, hurry!

226
00:16:09,741 --> 00:16:12,141
That's not very likely.

227
00:16:14,341 --> 00:16:15,141
Gojyo!

228
00:16:15,241 --> 00:16:16,174
Stand back!

229
00:16:16,274 --> 00:16:18,141
You'll just get swallowed
up too!

230
00:16:18,241 --> 00:16:21,374
But if you don't leave with me
you're going to die!

231
00:16:23,474 --> 00:16:26,641
You're not going to get rid of
me that easily, Meihou.

232
00:16:27,507 --> 00:16:30,174
[Meihou] No! GOJYO!

233
00:16:31,441 --> 00:16:33,107
Did you hear that?

234
00:16:33,207 --> 00:16:35,874
See? I told you they were
an item!

235
00:16:37,141 --> 00:16:40,007
[Demonic laughter]

236
00:16:41,341 --> 00:16:42,941
[Demon] What good fortune.

237
00:16:43,041 --> 00:16:47,041
I never expected anyone would
willing show up here to
be eaten.

238
00:16:47,141 --> 00:16:50,974
Your hospitality sure leaves
something to be desired
there, buddy.

239
00:16:51,074 --> 00:16:55,041
[Demon] A smartass. I usually
find them difficult to stomach.

240
00:16:55,141 --> 00:16:57,641
I always did have a
sharp tongue.

241
00:16:58,241 --> 00:16:59,541
[Demon] Who are you?

242
00:16:59,641 --> 00:17:00,874
No one.

243
00:17:00,974 --> 00:17:03,874
Fine, sometimes it's better not
to know what you're eating

244
00:17:03,974 --> 00:17:06,174
So, do you mind if I ask
you something?

245
00:17:06,274 --> 00:17:08,941
Do you keep those alive
over there?

246
00:17:09,041 --> 00:17:11,974
I like my food to be
freshly picked.

247
00:17:12,074 --> 00:17:14,374
Well thanks. That's good
to know.

248
00:17:14,474 --> 00:17:17,774
But I'm afraid I'm going to have
to eat you right away.

249
00:17:17,874 --> 00:17:21,541
Ooh, scary. Do tell me,
why is that?

250
00:17:21,641 --> 00:17:24,441
Because I can smell
you're dangerous!

251
00:17:29,441 --> 00:17:32,407
Well, well, that was
perfect timing.

252
00:17:32,507 --> 00:17:35,307
You know, you really add some
color to the place.

253
00:17:35,407 --> 00:17:38,341
Yeah, yeah, just get me down.

254
00:17:38,441 --> 00:17:40,641
I think we should take
photograph.

255
00:17:40,741 --> 00:17:42,507
Anything but that.

256
00:17:42,607 --> 00:17:44,841
Aw don't be shy now.

257
00:17:48,807 --> 00:17:50,774
I'm not finished with you!

258
00:17:59,074 --> 00:18:00,807
You just get back, Goku!

259
00:18:00,907 --> 00:18:02,141
Thank you!

260
00:18:02,241 --> 00:18:04,141
Damn! It's everywhere!

261
00:18:05,341 --> 00:18:08,374
Hakkai, isn't there something
you can do?!

262
00:18:08,474 --> 00:18:10,407
That's real easy for you
to say...

263
00:18:14,841 --> 00:18:16,841
You might want to try aiming
for that?

264
00:18:16,941 --> 00:18:19,407
It kind of looks like
a weakness.

265
00:18:19,507 --> 00:18:21,607
Really? You don't say?

266
00:18:21,707 --> 00:18:24,441
I'm gonna say we bet on
Hakkai's intuition.

267
00:18:24,541 --> 00:18:27,174
I agree. He is a gambler
after all.

268
00:18:27,874 --> 00:18:28,974
Here we go!

269
00:18:29,074 --> 00:18:30,707
Oh, no, you're not!

270
00:18:33,707 --> 00:18:35,407
And now, you're unarmed.

271
00:18:36,941 --> 00:18:40,374
Know what? I always prefer to
pull weeds...

272
00:18:40,474 --> 00:18:41,974
...with my hands

273
00:18:44,807 --> 00:18:45,974
Take that!

274
00:19:11,383 --> 00:19:14,049
It's Mother and- and Father!

275
00:19:17,616 --> 00:19:19,016
[Meihou] Mother!

276
00:19:20,949 --> 00:19:22,083
Meihou!

277
00:19:28,649 --> 00:19:30,083
[Meihou] Gojyo!

278
00:19:32,849 --> 00:19:34,349
[Gojyo] I'm happy for
you, Meihou.

279
00:19:35,049 --> 00:19:36,949
[Meihou] Thank you, Gojyo...

280
00:19:37,049 --> 00:19:38,916
[Gojyo] Yeah well, so long.

281
00:19:40,016 --> 00:19:42,116
Oh, I almost forgot.

282
00:19:42,216 --> 00:19:43,483
this looks better on you anyway.

283
00:19:43,583 --> 00:19:47,316
But Gojyo, I haven't give you
anything as payment, nothing!

284
00:19:49,916 --> 00:19:52,416
I'll look you up in about
ten years.

285
00:19:52,516 --> 00:19:55,583
Until then, they pendant will be
the way that I find you.

286
00:19:56,716 --> 00:19:58,716
I'll sure sweet-talk you good
and proper then.

287
00:19:58,816 --> 00:20:01,649
That's a promise.

288
00:20:01,749 --> 00:20:03,649
Gojyo, I can't wait!

289
00:20:10,816 --> 00:20:12,149
<i>Ten years, huh?</i>

290
00:20:13,416 --> 00:20:15,016
By the way, I don't get it,

291
00:20:15,116 --> 00:20:18,283
how did you three morons ever
figure out where you could
find me, huh?

292
00:20:18,383 --> 00:20:21,783
We wanted to get a look at that
girlfriend of yours.

293
00:20:21,883 --> 00:20:24,449
We kept hearing all these
strange rumors.

294
00:20:24,549 --> 00:20:27,616
Someone fitting your
description had rampaged
through town,

295
00:20:27,716 --> 00:20:30,816
then took off into the woods
with a little girl. What do
you make of that?

296
00:20:30,916 --> 00:20:32,549
That little girl was
pretty cute.

297
00:20:32,649 --> 00:20:35,449
Though I had no idea you had
such peculiar tastes.

298
00:20:35,549 --> 00:20:37,283
Do you wanna die, monkey?!

299
00:20:37,383 --> 00:20:40,583
What? It's the truth, isn't it?
You cradle-robbing water sprite.

300
00:20:40,683 --> 00:20:42,349
That's it!

301
00:20:42,449 --> 00:20:43,649
You're so dead!

302
00:20:44,916 --> 00:20:47,316
[Sanzo] Shut up! Or I'll kill
you both!

303
00:22:30,316 --> 00:22:33,583
[Sanzo] Three companions come
together in the steady rain,

304
00:22:33,683 --> 00:22:36,349
each with their own wounds
to heal.

305
00:22:36,449 --> 00:22:39,283
The pursuer and the pursued.

306
00:22:39,383 --> 00:22:43,283
Then the wheels of fate slowly
began to turn.

307
00:22:43,416 --> 00:22:48,283
Who knows what the future holds
when a man's past comes back to
haunt him.

308
00:22:48,383 --> 00:22:51,916
"The Storm of Fate" Next time
on Saiyuki.
