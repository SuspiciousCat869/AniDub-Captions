1
00:01:37,348 --> 00:01:38,482
[Goku] This sucks.

2
00:01:40,415 --> 00:01:43,048
[Gojyo] When did you become
such a slow poke, Hakkai?

3
00:01:43,148 --> 00:01:47,282
[Hakkai] I'm sorry, but
this is as fast as I can
go on this narrow road.

4
00:01:47,382 --> 00:01:49,648
Come on. Step on it, will ya?

5
00:01:49,748 --> 00:01:52,048
I'm about to go
insane over here.

6
00:01:53,682 --> 00:01:57,448
I guess you wouldn't be
so bored if I decided
to drive off that cliff.

7
00:01:57,548 --> 00:01:58,415
Tch.

8
00:01:58,515 --> 00:02:00,782
[Goku] When are we gonna eat?

9
00:02:00,882 --> 00:02:02,315
[Sanzo] Shut up.

10
00:02:02,415 --> 00:02:07,115
Come on! Show a little
pity! My poor stomach's
all tied up in knots!

11
00:02:08,848 --> 00:02:13,115
[Sanzo] Well, I could always
unravel some of those knots
for you, if you like.

12
00:02:13,215 --> 00:02:14,848
[Goku's stomach growls loudly]

13
00:02:17,382 --> 00:02:18,882
No need for that!

14
00:02:20,682 --> 00:02:23,948
[Sanzo] If you're so hungry,
eat the grass on the side
of the road or something.

15
00:02:24,648 --> 00:02:26,415
What?! Where is it?!

16
00:02:26,515 --> 00:02:28,215
I don't see any grass!

17
00:02:28,315 --> 00:02:29,448
[Loud rumbling]

18
00:02:41,682 --> 00:02:43,948
[Goku] "The Arrogance
of the Gods."

19
00:02:49,382 --> 00:02:52,282
[Jiroushin] Merciful Goddess!
Merciful Goddess!

20
00:02:52,382 --> 00:02:54,715
Souto... Souto has taken
his subordinates and-

21
00:02:54,815 --> 00:02:57,948
[Goddess] Relax, I know.

22
00:02:58,048 --> 00:03:03,015
It looks to me like
Homura's not the only
one bored with this place.

23
00:03:03,115 --> 00:03:06,448
How can you sit there?
If you knew that Homura
was going to do this,

24
00:03:06,548 --> 00:03:08,882
shouldn't you at least
be trying to bring him
back to the heavens?

25
00:03:08,982 --> 00:03:13,082
Why waste my time? You
know what he's like when
he's all wound up like that.

26
00:03:15,048 --> 00:03:20,982
Besides, Souto's little band
of mercenaries has already
joined forces with Homura.

27
00:03:21,082 --> 00:03:24,082
But Merciful Goddess, you know
what Souto's soldiers can do!

28
00:03:24,182 --> 00:03:29,282
They were able to easily
defeat a force ten times their
size in the last mock battle.

29
00:03:29,382 --> 00:03:32,615
Believe me, you do not want
these men as your enemy.

30
00:03:32,715 --> 00:03:35,248
But as talented as they are,
they're still just common

31
00:03:35,348 --> 00:03:38,115
soldiers lead by an
incompetent general.

32
00:03:39,315 --> 00:03:42,748
Lesser men have tried, and
greater men have failed.

33
00:03:42,848 --> 00:03:45,315
But, Merciful Goddess...

34
00:03:46,582 --> 00:03:48,315
Besides, who can blame him?

35
00:03:48,415 --> 00:03:50,982
Seeing how he's been
treated up here.

36
00:03:51,082 --> 00:03:54,748
I suspect many more will seek
to serve Homura in the future.

37
00:03:54,848 --> 00:03:57,048
[Jiroushin] You
can't be serious!

38
00:03:57,148 --> 00:04:01,682
[Goddess] Still, I didn't really
think he was such a fool.

39
00:04:11,382 --> 00:04:13,348
Souto's boys, eh?

40
00:04:15,548 --> 00:04:17,682
I have heard the stories.

41
00:04:17,782 --> 00:04:22,348
Your highness, I am sure
we can complete any
mission you ask of us.

42
00:04:22,448 --> 00:04:25,248
Please, my lord. Let us
serve your high purpose.

43
00:04:27,115 --> 00:04:28,115
We're yours.

44
00:04:28,215 --> 00:04:29,348
[All] Yes, Sir!

45
00:04:30,948 --> 00:04:32,982
[Shien] Homura...

46
00:04:33,082 --> 00:04:36,115
Tell me, have you ever
heard of the Sanzo party?

47
00:04:37,282 --> 00:04:38,148
[Souto] Yes.

48
00:04:38,248 --> 00:04:39,582
I want you to destroy them,

49
00:04:39,682 --> 00:04:41,982
and bring to me
the Maten Scripture.

50
00:04:43,548 --> 00:04:46,215
If you do that,
I'll consider it.

51
00:04:46,315 --> 00:04:47,448
[All] Aye!

52
00:04:48,382 --> 00:04:50,648
I promise, we will not fail you.

53
00:04:56,782 --> 00:04:58,448
So what is their status?

54
00:05:00,182 --> 00:05:01,315
Aye.

55
00:05:10,215 --> 00:05:12,782
Commander, I've spotted
some clothing.

56
00:05:12,882 --> 00:05:15,648
They appear to be
Goku's and Gojyo's.

57
00:05:15,748 --> 00:05:17,715
[Souto] I see.

58
00:05:17,815 --> 00:05:21,182
Never the less, we still
don't know if we got them all.

59
00:05:21,282 --> 00:05:23,548
Some still might have escaped.

60
00:05:23,648 --> 00:05:26,715
But even if they did
manage to get away,

61
00:05:26,815 --> 00:05:30,382
I seriously doubt
they'll survive the
traps we set for them.

62
00:05:30,482 --> 00:05:32,915
They will die... for our future!

63
00:05:37,382 --> 00:05:39,782
Commander, I've found
two sets of footprints.

64
00:05:39,882 --> 00:05:41,715
Two of them must have escaped.

65
00:05:42,248 --> 00:05:43,315
[Souto] Jikoku!

66
00:05:43,415 --> 00:05:44,548
Yeah.

67
00:05:45,148 --> 00:05:45,948
[Souto] Ryokusho!

68
00:05:46,048 --> 00:05:47,448
Yes, Sir!

69
00:05:47,548 --> 00:05:48,482
[Souto] Sekieki!

70
00:05:48,582 --> 00:05:49,382
Aye!

71
00:05:49,482 --> 00:05:51,248
[Souto] Go!
[All] Yes, Sir!

72
00:05:55,982 --> 00:05:59,115
[Hakkai] First a boulder
lands on us, and now this.

73
00:06:01,782 --> 00:06:04,048
Just a little
coincidence, right?

74
00:06:05,182 --> 00:06:07,215
Sure it is.

75
00:06:07,315 --> 00:06:10,082
It's all the work of some
out of control fur trapper.

76
00:06:10,182 --> 00:06:13,415
[Hakkai] Somehow I don't
believe that's the case.

77
00:06:13,515 --> 00:06:15,715
What do you think? You
think those two made it?

78
00:06:15,815 --> 00:06:20,148
I'm afraid we can't get rid of
dear Gojyo and pain in my ass
monkey boy that easily.

79
00:06:30,715 --> 00:06:33,548
35, 36, 37...

80
00:06:34,748 --> 00:06:36,648
That's it. They're
in the minefield.

81
00:06:40,082 --> 00:06:42,515
How can he be so stupid?!

82
00:06:42,615 --> 00:06:46,982
The fool has allowed us to
pinpoint his exact location.

83
00:06:47,082 --> 00:06:50,648
It won't be long before Jikoku
and the others find them.

84
00:06:55,048 --> 00:06:56,282
[Outo] Shall I take a look?

85
00:06:56,382 --> 00:06:57,882
Leave them. For now.

86
00:06:57,982 --> 00:07:00,748
The Scripture is
our first priority.

87
00:07:03,582 --> 00:07:08,082
<i>[Souto] You can't hide from</i>
<i>Jikoku forever, Genjo Sanzo.</i>

88
00:07:09,748 --> 00:07:11,215
[Hakkai] Sanzo?

89
00:07:11,315 --> 00:07:13,848
[Sanzo] Yeah, I know.

90
00:07:13,948 --> 00:07:19,548
[Sekieki] Impressive.
They've evaded every
single one of our traps.

91
00:07:19,648 --> 00:07:24,615
Heh, I gotta be honest here. It
wouldn't be any fun if we could
get rid of them that easily.

92
00:07:24,715 --> 00:07:26,415
Now would it, gentlemen?

93
00:07:26,515 --> 00:07:28,815
Let's all remember why
we're here, gentlemen.

94
00:07:28,915 --> 00:07:30,315
This is no joy ride.

95
00:07:30,415 --> 00:07:32,348
We're after that
sacred scripture.

96
00:07:32,448 --> 00:07:34,115
[Jikoku] Sekieki!
[Sekieki] Yeah?

97
00:07:34,248 --> 00:07:36,882
Listen here. Do try
to restrain yourself.

98
00:07:36,982 --> 00:07:39,882
The Maten Scripture's no
good to any of us burned up.

99
00:07:40,382 --> 00:07:41,515
[Sekieki] Hmph.

100
00:07:46,448 --> 00:07:47,882
Here goes.

101
00:07:47,982 --> 00:07:49,515
Sure looks that way.

102
00:07:56,482 --> 00:07:58,082
That was close!

103
00:07:58,182 --> 00:08:00,182
Now where the hell do
you think you're going?

104
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:04,615
Say your prayers, demon!

105
00:08:07,115 --> 00:08:08,248
A god?!

106
00:08:09,448 --> 00:08:10,315
You got that right!

107
00:08:10,415 --> 00:08:12,082
And you should be praying to us!

108
00:08:13,815 --> 00:08:17,082
<i>[Sanzo] "Us" huh? So</i>
<i>he's not working alone.</i>

109
00:08:29,448 --> 00:08:34,382
<i>That man bore a chakra on his</i>
<i>forehead, the sign of a god.</i>

110
00:08:36,748 --> 00:08:38,648
<i>Just my luck.</i>

111
00:08:40,148 --> 00:08:44,615
[Outo] Commander, the
team has made contact and
engaged the Sanzo party.

112
00:08:44,715 --> 00:08:48,248
Well done. He used a smoke
screen to confuse them,

113
00:08:48,348 --> 00:08:52,248
then he split them up
and attacked each of
them individually.

114
00:08:52,348 --> 00:08:55,715
It was truly a textbook
maneuver, my friend.

115
00:08:57,915 --> 00:08:59,048
[Hakkai] Sanzo?

116
00:08:59,915 --> 00:09:01,048
Sanzo?

117
00:09:12,482 --> 00:09:14,182
[Ryokusho] Too slow!

118
00:09:18,815 --> 00:09:22,482
How sad to have traveled
all this way just to die.

119
00:09:22,582 --> 00:09:24,215
Ow! [pained groaning]

120
00:09:28,415 --> 00:09:31,748
[Ryokusho] I usually kill people
much more gracefully than this,

121
00:09:31,848 --> 00:09:36,015
but we're in kind of a hurry,
so this will have to do.

122
00:09:37,282 --> 00:09:38,582
Now die!

123
00:09:48,615 --> 00:09:52,748
It's not so subtle, but it
certainly gets the job done!

124
00:10:01,082 --> 00:10:05,082
Commander, it looks
like Ryokusho took
care of Cho Hakkai.

125
00:10:05,182 --> 00:10:07,182
He's gone to regroup
with the others.

126
00:10:08,182 --> 00:10:10,148
I see.

127
00:10:10,248 --> 00:10:12,048
So that leaves just one.

128
00:10:12,548 --> 00:10:14,182
Genjo Sanzo!

129
00:10:26,256 --> 00:10:27,456
A spry one.

130
00:10:27,556 --> 00:10:30,023
Sekieki, don't just stand
there, do something, will ya?!

131
00:10:30,923 --> 00:10:32,723
Ha! Thought you'd never ask.

132
00:10:53,423 --> 00:10:57,356
Damn Sekieki. I
told him no bombs.

133
00:10:57,456 --> 00:11:00,323
Commander, with all those
explosions, won't he be making

134
00:11:00,423 --> 00:11:02,823
the others vulnerable
to friendly fire?

135
00:11:02,923 --> 00:11:05,656
You're right. I'll
go reign him in.

136
00:11:05,756 --> 00:11:08,889
Outo, you continue your
surveillance, just to be safe.

137
00:11:08,989 --> 00:11:10,123
Right.

138
00:11:18,189 --> 00:11:20,189
Sekieki, hold back!

139
00:11:20,289 --> 00:11:23,123
Scripture's no good to us
if you burn the damn thing!

140
00:11:23,223 --> 00:11:24,989
Looks like you need all
the help you can get.

141
00:11:25,089 --> 00:11:28,323
Don't blame me if
things get out of hand.

142
00:11:28,423 --> 00:11:31,189
<i>[Sanzo] Good. They're</i>
<i>fighting amongst themselves.</i>

143
00:11:33,656 --> 00:11:34,789
[Jikoku] Got him!

144
00:11:48,356 --> 00:11:50,089
[Sekieki] You aren't
getting away from me!

145
00:12:03,023 --> 00:12:04,489
[Jikoku] Commander!

146
00:12:04,623 --> 00:12:06,056
[Souto laughs]

147
00:12:06,156 --> 00:12:07,689
[Souto] Having a hard time?

148
00:12:07,789 --> 00:12:10,656
Sanzo has earned his reputation.

149
00:12:10,756 --> 00:12:12,989
But the legend dies right here.

150
00:12:13,089 --> 00:12:15,289
He can't evade us forever.

151
00:12:15,389 --> 00:12:16,856
[All] Yes, Sir!

152
00:12:39,589 --> 00:12:41,989
Damn, out of fuel.

153
00:12:42,856 --> 00:12:44,356
This sucks.

154
00:12:46,189 --> 00:12:48,923
Whaddya know, if it
isn't another one.

155
00:12:50,223 --> 00:12:52,989
I thought they taught you monks
a respect for mother nature,

156
00:12:53,089 --> 00:12:56,089
or did you skip holy
class that day?

157
00:12:56,189 --> 00:12:57,556
You know, that's funny.

158
00:12:57,656 --> 00:13:01,056
All this time I thought
tobacco was a part of nature.

159
00:13:03,556 --> 00:13:05,956
Keep blowin' smoke.
You're gonna burn.

160
00:13:07,789 --> 00:13:11,856
Just you try it. You
won't get away with it
this time, Priest Sanzo.

161
00:13:11,989 --> 00:13:14,089
[Souto and company laugh]

162
00:13:18,323 --> 00:13:21,856
Hehe, well it looks like
we finally got him.

163
00:13:21,956 --> 00:13:23,256
Let's see...

164
00:13:26,223 --> 00:13:28,056
Oh shit!

165
00:13:28,156 --> 00:13:30,189
There's no point in fighting.

166
00:13:30,289 --> 00:13:33,456
Hand over the Maten
Scripture and we'll go.

167
00:13:34,289 --> 00:13:36,323
I don't think so.

168
00:13:36,423 --> 00:13:39,823
Do you really want to join
your friends so badly?

169
00:13:39,923 --> 00:13:41,356
My friends, huh?

170
00:13:41,456 --> 00:13:45,589
I don't think I've ever
thought of any of those
guys as my friends.

171
00:13:47,289 --> 00:13:49,123
What the hell are
we waiting for?

172
00:13:49,223 --> 00:13:51,089
Let's kill the bastard already!

173
00:13:51,189 --> 00:13:52,489
Quiet!

174
00:13:52,589 --> 00:13:55,723
You know, I could put in a
good word with Homura for you,

175
00:13:55,823 --> 00:13:59,823
and he just might spare
your miserable life.

176
00:13:59,923 --> 00:14:03,189
I have no intention of spending
the rest of my life as his

177
00:14:03,289 --> 00:14:06,489
little hunting
dog like you guys.

178
00:14:06,589 --> 00:14:10,989
Shut up! Don't be such a smart
ass! It'll get you killed!

179
00:14:11,089 --> 00:14:15,023
I'm not not so sure.
I'm still here, aren't I?

180
00:14:16,723 --> 00:14:18,889
We can take care of
that soon enough!

181
00:14:23,389 --> 00:14:25,989
I believe you mentioned
my friends earlier.

182
00:14:26,089 --> 00:14:29,589
You wouldn't happen to know
where they might be hiding,
would you?

183
00:14:29,689 --> 00:14:32,389
Oh, you'll be seeing them soon.

184
00:14:32,489 --> 00:14:34,023
Perhaps you'd like to...

185
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:37,123
join your friends in
the great world beyond!

186
00:14:37,223 --> 00:14:39,023
See if you can dodge this!

187
00:14:43,056 --> 00:14:44,189
What the-?!

188
00:14:46,356 --> 00:14:47,456
That looks like...

189
00:14:47,556 --> 00:14:48,823
[Sekieki] It can't be!

190
00:14:48,923 --> 00:14:50,389
Son Goku!

191
00:14:50,489 --> 00:14:55,056
Tell me, is this "the great
world beyond" you mentioned?

192
00:14:55,156 --> 00:14:57,889
[Jikoku] Impossible! Gah!

193
00:14:59,389 --> 00:15:01,189
[Sanzo] Sure took
you long enough.

194
00:15:01,289 --> 00:15:02,423
I'm sorry!

195
00:15:06,656 --> 00:15:09,889
<i>[Outo] It's not exactly</i>

[Gojyo] You're not
too quick, are ya?

199
00:15:22,589 --> 00:15:24,456
I thought I'd die of boredom.

200
00:15:24,589 --> 00:15:26,156
[Outa] Sha Gojyo!

201
00:15:26,256 --> 00:15:29,089
That's right. My
name gets around.

202
00:15:29,189 --> 00:15:32,223
It looks like you're... a god.

203
00:15:32,323 --> 00:15:34,623
Looks like I won't
be bored after all.

204
00:15:36,056 --> 00:15:39,623
I-I can't believe I fell
for this obvious trick.

205
00:15:39,723 --> 00:15:45,856
It's common for tacticians like
you to plan too well and miss
seeing the bigger picture.

206
00:15:47,189 --> 00:15:50,323
[Souto] Jikoku may be dead,
but we still have the numbers.

207
00:15:50,423 --> 00:15:51,623
Hold your ground!

208
00:15:51,723 --> 00:15:55,689
[Hakkai] I'm sorry. I'm afraid
that's no longer the case.

209
00:15:56,723 --> 00:15:59,423
[Souto] If it isn't Cho Hakkai!

210
00:15:59,523 --> 00:16:01,889
How do you explain this?!

211
00:16:01,989 --> 00:16:04,989
Uh, I was sure that
I had killed him!

212
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:07,889
You know wha they say, if you
ever meet a giant grizzly bear

213
00:16:07,989 --> 00:16:10,489
in the forest you should just
roll over and play dead.

214
00:16:10,589 --> 00:16:11,689
Least that's what I did.

215
00:16:11,789 --> 00:16:13,423
Hold on! If you're not dead,

216
00:16:13,523 --> 00:16:16,356
you sure did scream like
you're a little girl!

217
00:16:16,456 --> 00:16:21,923
I'm sorry, but my entire plan
hinged on giving you a totally
convincing performance.

218
00:16:22,023 --> 00:16:28,156
[Souto] Don't tell me the whole
thing was all a hoax so you
could assess the enemy!

219
00:16:28,256 --> 00:16:31,389
[Hakkai] Well... Hakuryu
and I might have taken
a little look around.

220
00:16:31,489 --> 00:16:34,989
Correct me if I'm wrong,
but it looks as though
there were only five of you.

221
00:16:35,089 --> 00:16:39,923
Oh haha, that's right. We
killed one, so that leaves four.

222
00:16:40,023 --> 00:16:41,656
[Gojyo] I'm afraid not.

223
00:16:44,656 --> 00:16:46,423
[Goku] Gojyo!

224
00:16:46,523 --> 00:16:49,623
I just killed that greenhorn
back at the cliff, so...

225
00:16:49,723 --> 00:16:53,189
if my math is right,
that just leaves three.

226
00:16:53,289 --> 00:16:56,556
[Souto] Outo is dead too?

227
00:16:56,656 --> 00:17:01,623
Ooh? So the asanine
assassins didn't kill you
after all, did they, monk?

228
00:17:01,723 --> 00:17:05,856
You bastards. You had me running
all over this stupid forest.

229
00:17:06,989 --> 00:17:09,123
You got a little
winded, didn't you?

230
00:17:09,223 --> 00:17:12,256
That's because you
smoke way too much.

231
00:17:12,356 --> 00:17:13,956
I'll snuff you out.

232
00:17:14,056 --> 00:17:16,123
[Hakkai] That's not very
nice. Apologize to Gojyo.

233
00:17:16,223 --> 00:17:18,456
<i>[Ryokusho] What is</i>
<i>it with these guys?</i>

234
00:17:18,556 --> 00:17:20,623
<i>It's like we're not even here.</i>

235
00:17:20,723 --> 00:17:22,689
[The Sanzo party continues
to casually chat]

236
00:17:22,789 --> 00:17:26,889
<i>[Ryokusho] I'll get</i>
<i>their attention!</i>

237
00:17:26,989 --> 00:17:30,256
I'll make sure
you die this time!

238
00:17:30,356 --> 00:17:32,223
[Souto & Sekieki] Ryokusho!

239
00:17:32,323 --> 00:17:34,056
Don't take this the wrong way,

240
00:17:34,156 --> 00:17:37,023
but I don't intend to let
myself die in your arms!

241
00:17:42,156 --> 00:17:43,356
Ryokusho.

242
00:17:47,422 --> 00:17:51,123
Okay, I guess that's
Hakkai: 2, Grizzly bear: 0.

243
00:17:51,123 --> 00:17:56,256
Damn it. And I really
wanted to waste that stupid
guy for making me run so much.

244
00:17:56,356 --> 00:17:58,623
Looks like I'm left with
the crumbs as usual.

245
00:17:58,723 --> 00:18:01,689
[Sekieki] Crumbs? Don't
underestimate me.

246
00:18:08,923 --> 00:18:10,056
[Sekieki screams]

247
00:18:12,923 --> 00:18:15,656
Hmph. That'll teach you
to overestimate yourself.

248
00:18:15,756 --> 00:18:18,223
Se-Sekieki...

249
00:18:18,323 --> 00:18:22,556
Uh-oh, looks like all of your
trusty little friends are gone.

250
00:18:22,656 --> 00:18:25,689
You should see when
Sanzo gets really mad.

251
00:18:25,789 --> 00:18:29,489
I think it's best for all
concerned to surrender quietly.

252
00:18:33,289 --> 00:18:35,356
[Souto] Tell me, Genjo Sanzo,

253
00:18:35,456 --> 00:18:38,089
if your friends had
truly been dead,

254
00:18:38,189 --> 00:18:41,989
would you still have turned
down my offer to join Homura?

255
00:18:43,656 --> 00:18:45,356
[Sanzo] Yes.

256
00:18:45,456 --> 00:18:47,223
[Souto] So be it.

257
00:18:47,323 --> 00:18:49,689
We were far too ambitious.

258
00:18:49,789 --> 00:18:53,856
But we could no longer
serve the incompetent
heavens in good conscience.

259
00:18:53,956 --> 00:18:55,589
We served Homura...

260
00:18:55,689 --> 00:18:57,823
to seek our fortune!

261
00:18:57,923 --> 00:18:59,589
I'm not going back!

262
00:18:59,689 --> 00:19:03,456
I'll get that Scripture
if I have to kill every
last one of you!

263
00:19:03,556 --> 00:19:04,689
Goku!

264
00:19:06,389 --> 00:19:07,589
I'm on it!

265
00:19:16,223 --> 00:19:18,456
Wipe that damn smile
off your face!

266
00:19:18,556 --> 00:19:20,123
What smile's that?

267
00:19:22,889 --> 00:19:24,023
[Souto] Damn you!

268
00:19:26,056 --> 00:19:27,456
Stupid chimp.

269
00:19:27,556 --> 00:19:29,089
What to do with him?

270
00:19:29,956 --> 00:19:31,889
Heh. He's sure having fun.

271
00:19:40,923 --> 00:19:42,889
But... but why?

272
00:19:42,989 --> 00:19:47,923
Unlike you, I know when
it comes my time to die.

273
00:19:48,023 --> 00:19:51,423
In the Heavens, we
had never known defeat.

274
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:53,089
So you must tell me...

275
00:19:53,189 --> 00:19:57,723
How were you able to beat us?
What power do you have...

276
00:19:57,823 --> 00:20:00,856
that allows you to
outmaneuver heaven?

277
00:20:03,923 --> 00:20:06,156
All the battles
we've survived...

278
00:20:08,156 --> 00:20:10,156
The fact that we're alive...

279
00:20:12,789 --> 00:20:14,489
And we don't believe.

280
00:20:15,156 --> 00:20:16,789
Now I see...

281
00:20:21,289 --> 00:20:22,689
How stupid.

282
00:20:26,223 --> 00:20:29,456
They should have known they
didn't stand a chance
against them.

283
00:20:29,556 --> 00:20:34,123
It would have been considerably
worse for them to keep rotting
away in heaven.

284
00:20:34,223 --> 00:20:38,123
I admire their tenacious
determination to change
their fate.

285
00:20:38,223 --> 00:20:43,589
It's so much better that they
died this way, don't you think?

286
00:20:43,689 --> 00:20:47,889
I'd say they did remarkably
well for common soldiers.
