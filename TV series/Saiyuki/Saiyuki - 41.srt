1
00:01:46,818 --> 00:01:48,485
Uh, sorry.

2
00:01:52,451 --> 00:01:53,985
<i>[Kenren] Golden eyes...</i>

3
00:01:54,818 --> 00:01:55,918
[Goku] See ya!
[Kenren] Wait a sec.

4
00:01:57,018 --> 00:01:58,985
What didja go and do that for?!

5
00:01:59,085 --> 00:02:04,385
You wouldn't happen to be
the Goku that Tenpou was
talking about, would you?

6
00:02:04,485 --> 00:02:08,485
Wha... What, are you a good
friend of Tenpy's, mister?

7
00:02:08,585 --> 00:02:11,551
I'm no mister! I'm not that old.

8
00:02:12,751 --> 00:02:14,418
General Kenren!

9
00:02:14,518 --> 00:02:16,418
[Kenren] Hm?
[Subordinate 2] General Kenren.

10
00:02:16,518 --> 00:02:17,951
[Subordinate 2] That child
has been wandering through

11
00:02:18,051 --> 00:02:20,351
the Emperor's castle
without permission.

12
00:02:20,451 --> 00:02:23,018
There's no telling
how he got in here.

13
00:02:23,118 --> 00:02:25,151
[Kenren] It's okay.
He's with me.

14
00:02:25,251 --> 00:02:28,085
[Subordinate 2] What?
So you know him, General?

15
00:02:28,185 --> 00:02:30,018
[Kenren] You could say that...

16
00:02:31,618 --> 00:02:33,218
He's my bastard son.

17
00:02:33,718 --> 00:02:34,851
[Both] Son?

18
00:02:36,018 --> 00:02:37,651
[Kenren chuckles, amused]

19
00:02:40,585 --> 00:02:43,451
[Goddess] Things that
don't change are so lame.

20
00:02:49,618 --> 00:02:51,551
[Goku] "Defying the Gods."

21
00:02:56,718 --> 00:02:59,251
[Kenren] Why'd you
sneak in there anyway?

22
00:02:59,351 --> 00:03:02,518
The castle's not connected
to the Goddess's palace.

23
00:03:02,618 --> 00:03:07,985
Well, that's where I met my new
bestest friend in the whole
world, Nataku, the other day.

24
00:03:08,085 --> 00:03:09,151
[Kenren] Nataku?

25
00:03:09,251 --> 00:03:11,785
[Goku] Yeah! I came
back to look for him.

26
00:03:11,885 --> 00:03:13,351
Hey, wait a minute.

27
00:03:13,451 --> 00:03:15,985
You can't mean the
War Prince Nataku.

28
00:03:16,085 --> 00:03:18,385
Mmhmm! That's him, alright!

29
00:03:18,485 --> 00:03:20,385
Now that I finally
got myself a name,

30
00:03:20,485 --> 00:03:22,018
I wanted to tell
him what it was.

31
00:03:22,118 --> 00:03:23,718
'Cause it's a really cool one!

32
00:03:23,818 --> 00:03:24,818
<i>[Kenren] Whaddya know?</i>

33
00:03:24,918 --> 00:03:27,818
<i>The puppet assassin</i>
<i>has a friend.</i>

34
00:03:27,918 --> 00:03:28,585
What?

35
00:03:28,685 --> 00:03:31,185
[Kenren] Oh, nothing.

36
00:03:31,285 --> 00:03:34,118
Nataku's kind of busy right now.

37
00:03:34,218 --> 00:03:35,451
[Goku] He's not here?

38
00:03:36,651 --> 00:03:38,851
[Kenren] He's got stuff
to do in the Lower World.

39
00:03:38,951 --> 00:03:40,485
He should be back in a few days.

40
00:03:40,618 --> 00:03:41,618
[Goku] I'll come by then.

41
00:03:44,351 --> 00:03:46,951
Oh man, you are really heavy.

42
00:03:47,051 --> 00:03:49,718
[Goku] Huh? Oh, yeah.

43
00:03:49,818 --> 00:03:52,651
That's 'cause I have these on.

44
00:03:52,751 --> 00:03:55,251
<i>[Kenren] Wow.</i>

45
00:03:55,351 --> 00:03:57,718
<i>These manacles as</i>
<i>heavy as boulders,</i>

46
00:03:57,818 --> 00:04:01,385
<i>yet he moves around</i>
<i>like they're nothing.</i>

47
00:04:01,485 --> 00:04:05,585
<i>How dangerous does this kid</i>
<i>have to be to warrant such</i>
<i>drastic measures?</i>

48
00:04:07,918 --> 00:04:09,351
[Kenren] You're something else.

49
00:04:09,451 --> 00:04:12,185
[Subordinate] General Kenren!
[Kenren] What's up?

50
00:04:12,285 --> 00:04:15,551
[Subordinate] Prince Nataku
has just returned from
the Lower World!

51
00:04:15,651 --> 00:04:17,285
What? Really?

52
00:04:18,718 --> 00:04:19,951
There a problem?

53
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:22,418
[Subordinate] No, Nataku
defeated Gyumaoh...

54
00:04:22,518 --> 00:04:25,151
But I'm afraid the battle
has taken it's toll on him.

55
00:04:40,885 --> 00:04:42,785
[Attendant] Are you
all right, Lord-

56
00:04:44,051 --> 00:04:45,185
Hands off!

57
00:04:46,151 --> 00:04:47,951
[Goku] Nataku!

58
00:04:48,051 --> 00:04:49,651
Nataku, are you alright?

59
00:04:49,751 --> 00:04:51,018
Nataku!

60
00:04:51,118 --> 00:04:53,651
You're the... guy I met...

61
00:04:57,551 --> 00:04:59,418
[Goku] Nataku!

62
00:04:59,518 --> 00:05:01,118
Nataku!

63
00:05:01,218 --> 00:05:03,218
Nataku!

64
00:05:03,318 --> 00:05:05,685
Hey, Tenpou.

65
00:05:08,085 --> 00:05:10,418
Daydreaming again, eh Tenpou?

66
00:05:12,318 --> 00:05:13,918
You there, Tenpou?

67
00:05:15,918 --> 00:05:19,018
Sheesh, I just helped you
organize this place a month ago.

68
00:05:21,185 --> 00:05:22,918
Hey! Where are you?

69
00:05:23,551 --> 00:05:24,685
Hello.

70
00:05:27,151 --> 00:05:31,351
[Kenren] "Hello?" That all
you have to say after all the
times I called out to you?

71
00:05:31,451 --> 00:05:34,818
[Tenpou] Augh, sorry.
I guess I didn't hear you.

72
00:05:34,918 --> 00:05:37,451
[Kenren] I was screaming
at the top of my lungs.

73
00:05:37,551 --> 00:05:39,351
[Tenpou] I must have gotten
absorbed in this book on

74
00:05:39,451 --> 00:05:42,218
the military history
of the Lower World.

75
00:05:42,318 --> 00:05:45,951
This is amazing. You would
think that peace would
not be possible,

76
00:05:46,051 --> 00:05:49,051
for a race that refuses
to believe in ideology.

77
00:05:49,151 --> 00:05:51,385
But they seem to have
found their own way.

78
00:05:51,485 --> 00:05:56,385
I do believe this strange race
has stumbled upon a way to
achieve a balance.

79
00:05:56,485 --> 00:06:01,385
[Kenren] You know, I don't
think it's possible for
me to care any less.

80
00:06:01,485 --> 00:06:02,618
Oh?

81
00:06:04,551 --> 00:06:08,951
Thought you should know,
Nataku is back from his mission.

82
00:06:09,051 --> 00:06:10,751
That sure didn't take very long.

83
00:06:10,851 --> 00:06:14,385
I mean, after all the
administration's hand wringing.

84
00:06:14,485 --> 00:06:19,651
Looks to me like the great
Prince Nataku didn't exactly
escape unscathed this time.

85
00:06:19,751 --> 00:06:21,951
They say he's unconscious.

86
00:06:22,051 --> 00:06:27,151
There's one thing that
still bothers me...
about those soldiers.

87
00:06:30,985 --> 00:06:36,451
Every one of them came
back without so much
as a scratch on them.

88
00:06:36,551 --> 00:06:41,385
Meaning they all just stood
by and watched the battle?
That bothers me too.

89
00:06:41,485 --> 00:06:46,385
Hm, by the way, I happened
to run into that little
pipsqueak friend of yours.

90
00:06:46,485 --> 00:06:47,818
[Tenpou] Oh? Goku?

91
00:06:47,918 --> 00:06:51,151
[Kenren] That's the first
time I've seen golden eyes,

92
00:06:51,251 --> 00:06:55,418
yet that little monkey didn't
seem much like a heretic to me.

93
00:06:56,718 --> 00:07:01,385
He acted like such a
harmless little goofball.

94
00:07:01,518 --> 00:07:03,885
Are those shackles
really necessary?

95
00:07:03,985 --> 00:07:08,385
Immortals don't really care very
much for heretics, now do they?

96
00:07:08,485 --> 00:07:13,518
You know the real reason they
chain him, only because they
can't eliminate him.

97
00:07:13,618 --> 00:07:16,618
In that sense, he's very
much like Prince Nataku.

98
00:07:21,885 --> 00:07:25,218
[Old God] You are a heretic!

99
00:07:25,318 --> 00:07:29,051
[Nataku's mother] How could
I have given birth to such
a horrible monster?!

100
00:07:29,151 --> 00:07:30,751
It's disgusting!

101
00:07:30,851 --> 00:07:33,085
[Touten] You were
born only to fight.

102
00:07:33,185 --> 00:07:35,751
No one will grieve if you die.

103
00:07:35,851 --> 00:07:37,385
Stop it! Stop it!

104
00:07:37,485 --> 00:07:39,285
JUST STOP IT!

105
00:07:39,385 --> 00:07:40,751
[Goku] Nataku!
[Nataku] Huh?!

106
00:07:42,985 --> 00:07:44,551
Good, you're awake!

107
00:07:45,118 --> 00:07:47,351
[Nataku] It's you...

108
00:07:47,451 --> 00:07:50,185
[Goku] I was starting to wonder
if you'd ever wake up at all.

109
00:07:52,051 --> 00:07:53,951
You alright, Nataku?

110
00:07:54,585 --> 00:07:55,751
Yeah.

111
00:07:56,151 --> 00:07:58,085
I guess...

112
00:07:58,185 --> 00:08:00,518
I remember battling Gyumaoh...

113
00:08:00,618 --> 00:08:02,285
Now I'm here.

114
00:08:02,385 --> 00:08:04,451
Jerks. Look at this place!

115
00:08:04,551 --> 00:08:07,851
You fight that guy,
then they go and stick
you in a place like this?

116
00:08:07,951 --> 00:08:09,418
It's like a prison!

117
00:08:11,918 --> 00:08:15,151
[Nataku] It's okay.
I'm expendable.

118
00:08:15,251 --> 00:08:17,351
No one cares what happens to me.

119
00:08:18,651 --> 00:08:21,551
[Goku] And just what's
that suppose to mean?

120
00:08:21,651 --> 00:08:24,185
I certainly don't think so.

121
00:08:24,285 --> 00:08:26,385
I'm here, aren't I?

122
00:08:26,485 --> 00:08:29,918
You're the only person who
hasn't treated me like
some kind of heretic.

123
00:08:30,018 --> 00:08:33,551
I mean, you even like the
fact that I'm different
than everybody else.

124
00:08:35,785 --> 00:08:37,851
I see.

125
00:08:37,951 --> 00:08:40,751
Let's say, as soon as I'm
healed and feeling better,

126
00:08:40,851 --> 00:08:44,651
I'll show you around some.
I know lots of good
places to hide,

127
00:08:44,751 --> 00:08:47,685
where we can pick berries
or whatever you want.

128
00:08:47,785 --> 00:08:48,818
I'm there!

129
00:08:48,918 --> 00:08:50,151
That would be just great!

130
00:08:51,285 --> 00:08:53,085
You don't look so good.

131
00:08:53,185 --> 00:08:55,185
Uh... I'll go get someone.

132
00:08:55,518 --> 00:08:56,651
Huh?

133
00:08:57,785 --> 00:08:59,785
Please don't go. I'll be fine.

134
00:09:04,851 --> 00:09:07,485
Lord Konzen, I humbly
beg your forgiveness.

135
00:09:07,585 --> 00:09:10,551
I'm sorry, we had no
idea you were his guardian.

136
00:09:10,651 --> 00:09:12,685
I'm not his guardian.

137
00:09:12,785 --> 00:09:14,018
I'm his owner.

138
00:09:14,151 --> 00:09:16,118
[Attendant] What?

139
00:09:16,218 --> 00:09:18,085
[Konzen] Sorry if he troubled
you. I'll take him home.

140
00:09:19,685 --> 00:09:21,718
[Konzen] Hey, monkey,
get your butt over here.

141
00:09:29,385 --> 00:09:30,885
Oh great.

142
00:09:30,985 --> 00:09:32,418
Now there's two of them.

143
00:09:39,902 --> 00:09:41,535
[Goku] Hey, Konzen.

144
00:09:41,635 --> 00:09:44,869
What are all those people out
there for? What are they doing?

145
00:09:44,969 --> 00:09:46,935
It's a festival... for
the Jade Emperor's birthday.

146
00:09:49,235 --> 00:09:50,502
A festival?

147
00:09:50,635 --> 00:09:53,535
Believe me, it's not
as fun as it sounds.

148
00:09:53,635 --> 00:09:56,302
I've got an idea, why don't you
just stay here for tonight?

149
00:09:59,369 --> 00:10:00,802
Do what you want.

150
00:10:00,902 --> 00:10:04,469
[Goku] Yaaaaaay! A festival!

151
00:10:04,569 --> 00:10:07,802
[Goku yells in frustration]
[Konzen] Damn it!
What the hell is it now?!

152
00:10:07,902 --> 00:10:12,102
My name! I totally forgot to
tell Nataku my name yesterday!

153
00:10:12,202 --> 00:10:14,369
And after all that trouble too!

154
00:10:14,469 --> 00:10:18,269
What's the problem?
Can't you just tell him
the next time you see him?

155
00:10:20,269 --> 00:10:21,402
You're buddies, right?

156
00:10:23,135 --> 00:10:24,335
Yeah! That's right!

157
00:10:27,102 --> 00:10:29,469
[Touten] Do you think
we're in any danger?

158
00:10:29,569 --> 00:10:31,569
[Administrator 1] It is true,
there have been some grumblings

159
00:10:31,669 --> 00:10:34,669
of dissatisfaction with
the administration.

160
00:10:34,769 --> 00:10:36,869
[Administrator 2] They are
only rumors at this point.

161
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:39,735
I don't believe it's gone too
far up the chain of command.

162
00:10:39,835 --> 00:10:43,002
But it could interfere
with our plan.

163
00:10:43,102 --> 00:10:47,469
[Touten] Fine, dispose of them
as soon as you've located
these conspirators.

164
00:10:47,569 --> 00:10:48,802
[Administrator 2] As you wish.

165
00:10:48,902 --> 00:10:52,335
[Administrator 1] I think Nataku
could be a problem for us.

166
00:10:52,435 --> 00:10:55,835
He is unusually disobedient.

167
00:10:55,935 --> 00:10:59,569
[Touten] Like all good warriors,
he is somewhat brash
and arrogant.

168
00:10:59,669 --> 00:11:01,335
And headstrong at times.

169
00:11:04,069 --> 00:11:07,469
But he would never
dare oppose my will.

170
00:11:08,169 --> 00:11:10,235
He is a dutiful son.

171
00:11:39,702 --> 00:11:41,869
Wow, so cool!

172
00:11:41,969 --> 00:11:45,435
This little soiree is the most
popular festival we have.

173
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:47,202
You could get lost in a crowd.

174
00:11:48,069 --> 00:11:50,035
Which means, don't wander off!

175
00:11:53,935 --> 00:11:56,735
[Yawning loudly]

176
00:11:56,835 --> 00:11:59,869
Merciful Goddess,
someone might see you!

177
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:02,535
But I'm so freaking bored.

178
00:12:02,635 --> 00:12:05,935
Do you think I want to
be at this old geezer's
birthday party?

179
00:12:06,035 --> 00:12:08,702
I've got better things
to do with my time.

180
00:12:08,802 --> 00:12:10,969
He's immortal,
for crying out loud.

181
00:12:11,069 --> 00:12:17,469
The only reason we have to
be here is to demonstrate our
loyalty to him, year after year.

182
00:12:17,569 --> 00:12:21,135
And what's that prove,
since attendance is
mandatory anyway?

183
00:12:21,902 --> 00:12:24,602
Ah! But then again, this year...

184
00:12:24,702 --> 00:12:25,769
Lady?

185
00:12:25,869 --> 00:12:29,835
We might get a shake up
of the same old routine.

186
00:12:29,935 --> 00:12:31,335
[Merciful Goddess chuckles]

187
00:13:06,069 --> 00:13:07,202
[Goku] Huh?

188
00:13:09,069 --> 00:13:10,535
Where's Konzen?

189
00:13:10,635 --> 00:13:12,935
Attention! Attention!

190
00:13:13,035 --> 00:13:15,702
May I have your
attention, please!

191
00:13:15,802 --> 00:13:19,335
Goku, don't you even think
about talking during the
Emperor's speech.

192
00:13:22,302 --> 00:13:25,335
Now where the hell did he...
run off to this time?!

193
00:13:40,569 --> 00:13:42,035
<i>[Nataku] Look at</i>
<i>all those posers.</i>

194
00:13:42,969 --> 00:13:44,935
<i>Acting like they</i>
<i>want me to be there.</i>

195
00:13:45,769 --> 00:13:47,802
<i>It disgusts me.</i>

196
00:13:47,902 --> 00:13:50,069
[Touten] You look bored, Nataku.

197
00:13:51,702 --> 00:13:55,402
Uh, no. I'm just tired,
that's all... father.

198
00:13:55,502 --> 00:13:59,235
Listen son, I want
you to know something.

199
00:13:59,335 --> 00:14:02,735
One day, I will be
the Jade Emperor.

200
00:14:02,835 --> 00:14:06,635
And you will be my
shining successor.

201
00:14:06,735 --> 00:14:09,469
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

202
00:14:10,502 --> 00:14:12,102
Well?

203
00:14:12,202 --> 00:14:14,102
[Nataku] Yes, father.

204
00:14:14,202 --> 00:14:19,269
<i>[Nataku] Sometimes...</i>
<i>I see danger looming</i>
<i>in my father's eyes.</i>

205
00:14:20,435 --> 00:14:24,002
I have ruled a period
of unprecedented peace.

206
00:14:24,102 --> 00:14:27,635
But now I must call on you
to destroy the demon race!

207
00:14:27,735 --> 00:14:30,102
Heaven needs your service!

208
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:32,602
Oh man, where did he go now?

209
00:14:32,702 --> 00:14:34,902
I bet he's really
gonna be mad at me.

210
00:14:36,002 --> 00:14:37,569
Maybe he's over this way.

211
00:14:38,935 --> 00:14:41,869
[Attendee 1] Now who let
this animal off it's leash?

212
00:14:41,969 --> 00:14:44,302
You should watch where
you're going, punk.

213
00:14:44,402 --> 00:14:48,435
What the hell? You're the
one who ran into me, you jerk!

214
00:14:48,535 --> 00:14:52,302
[Attendee 2] What?
[Attendee 1] Hey look.
The boy has golden eyes.

215
00:14:53,435 --> 00:14:56,302
Yeah, you're right.
So this is the guy.

216
00:14:56,402 --> 00:15:01,935
[Attendee 1] Yes it is. That
vile heretic they dug up from
the lower world. Disgusting.

217
00:15:02,035 --> 00:15:05,402
[Attendee 2] You know,
for as much of an antisocial
hermit as Konzen is,

218
00:15:05,502 --> 00:15:08,169
he sure dotes over this creature
like an old mother hen.

219
00:15:08,269 --> 00:15:12,069
I think we may have
finally found out why
he doesn't like women.

220
00:15:12,169 --> 00:15:14,235
He likes little boys!

221
00:15:14,335 --> 00:15:15,669
[Attendee 1 laughs]

222
00:15:17,835 --> 00:15:21,069
Did you just say something
bad about my friend, Konzen?

223
00:15:21,169 --> 00:15:22,902
I won't let you get
away with that!

224
00:15:23,002 --> 00:15:25,202
Now take it back, right now!

225
00:15:25,302 --> 00:15:26,669
You'll pay for this!

226
00:15:28,402 --> 00:15:32,835
Don't tell me this
is the way you always
discipline little boys.

227
00:15:32,935 --> 00:15:34,802
[Goku] Hey! Tenpy!

228
00:15:35,602 --> 00:15:36,935
Wh-why aren't you...

229
00:15:37,035 --> 00:15:40,569
Well, if it isn't that
Field Marshal Tenpou.

230
00:15:40,669 --> 00:15:42,935
You two might try
growing up some,

231
00:15:43,035 --> 00:15:47,502
rather than going around
picking on little children,
who are half your size.

232
00:15:47,602 --> 00:15:50,869
Ha! Those are awfully big
words for a foot soldier.

233
00:15:50,969 --> 00:15:52,735
What's all of this ruckus?!

234
00:15:52,835 --> 00:15:57,035
Who in the name of the
Heavens dares to disrupt
the Emperor's speech?

235
00:15:57,135 --> 00:15:59,469
[Soldier 1] One side, one side!
[Soldier 2] Out of the way!

236
00:15:59,569 --> 00:16:02,869
Alright now! What the hell
is all this racket about?!

237
00:16:02,969 --> 00:16:05,602
What's this!? Get rid of
this disgusting creature!

238
00:16:05,702 --> 00:16:06,802
On the double!

239
00:16:06,902 --> 00:16:09,335
[Soldier 2] Yes, Sir!
[Goku] Ugh! Don't touch me!

240
00:16:12,569 --> 00:16:13,969
Moron!

241
00:16:14,069 --> 00:16:15,569
Catch that runt!

242
00:16:15,669 --> 00:16:17,402
Wait, that child is...

243
00:16:17,502 --> 00:16:18,702
[Soldier] Hyah!

244
00:16:18,802 --> 00:16:20,169
Take that.

245
00:16:20,269 --> 00:16:21,769
Okay, that was funny.

246
00:16:21,869 --> 00:16:23,035
Kenren...

247
00:16:23,135 --> 00:16:27,335
This looks like a lot more
fun than that boring speech.

248
00:16:27,435 --> 00:16:29,335
May I join you?

249
00:16:29,435 --> 00:16:34,102
Oooh boy. Looks to me like
things just took a big
fat turn for the worse.

250
00:16:34,202 --> 00:16:39,169
Even a four-star general would
be punished for this moral
outrage and disrespect!

251
00:16:39,269 --> 00:16:45,069
Heh. Believe me, I should be
rewarded for disrupting
that boring old thing.

252
00:16:46,135 --> 00:16:47,602
So, come on guys!

253
00:16:47,702 --> 00:16:51,035
If you've been wanting a piece
of me, here's your chance.

254
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:52,935
[Kenren chuckles]

255
00:16:53,035 --> 00:16:56,035
[Tenpou] You just had to
rile them up, didn't you?

256
00:16:56,769 --> 00:16:57,769
[Attendee 1] Get him!

257
00:16:57,869 --> 00:16:59,702
It's about damn time too!

258
00:17:03,069 --> 00:17:05,035
[Kenren laughs]

259
00:17:06,435 --> 00:17:08,069
This is too much fun.

260
00:17:08,169 --> 00:17:12,102
You've sure made a lot of
enemies lately, haven't you?

261
00:17:12,202 --> 00:17:13,769
You realize...

262
00:17:13,869 --> 00:17:18,369
that they only hate me because
I happen to work with you.

263
00:17:18,469 --> 00:17:21,402
Oh? I'm sorry, I didn't
realize it was like that.

264
00:17:21,502 --> 00:17:22,635
In that case...

265
00:17:24,169 --> 00:17:25,935
I'll lend you a hand.

266
00:17:26,035 --> 00:17:27,502
<i>[Goku] Nailed him...</i>

267
00:17:27,602 --> 00:17:31,002
<i>Wow, what a punch!</i>
<i>These guys are awesome!</i>

268
00:17:31,335 --> 00:17:32,269
Uh oh!

269
00:17:32,369 --> 00:17:33,835
Look out, Tenpy!

270
00:17:35,835 --> 00:17:38,302
Whoo! Not bad for
a little monkey.

271
00:17:39,202 --> 00:17:40,769
Don't call me a monkey!

272
00:17:40,869 --> 00:17:42,269
[Jade Emperor continues
with his speech]
[Attendant 1] Quiet down there!

273
00:17:42,369 --> 00:17:44,969
We are trying to listen!

274
00:17:45,069 --> 00:17:49,069
[Emperor] -in the name of
peace, we must root them out!
<i>[Gojun] Him again.</i>

275
00:17:49,169 --> 00:17:51,402
[Touten] What is it?
[Lady] My lord, I'm afraid

276
00:17:51,502 --> 00:17:54,569
something appears to be causing
a commotion in the square.

277
00:17:57,135 --> 00:17:58,702
<i>[Nataku] It's him!</i>

278
00:17:58,802 --> 00:18:00,569
[Touten] Disgusting.

279
00:18:00,669 --> 00:18:06,002
It disturbs me to hear
of men of such poor and
degenerate characteristics.

280
00:18:08,202 --> 00:18:10,435
Don't you agree, Nataku?

281
00:18:10,535 --> 00:18:11,935
[Nataku] Yes, father.

282
00:18:12,069 --> 00:18:14,435
<i>[Nataku] Freedom lies just</i>
<i>beyond this railing...</i>

283
00:18:14,535 --> 00:18:17,069
<i>and I am too weak</i>
<i>to reach for it.</i>

284
00:18:20,894 --> 00:18:22,574
Hey! What's all this racket?!

285
00:18:22,574 --> 00:18:25,040
Do you hear me?! Be quiet!

286
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:27,107
[Merciful Goddess chuckles]

287
00:18:27,207 --> 00:18:30,374
See, Jiroushin? Don't
you find this amusing?

288
00:18:30,474 --> 00:18:33,440
I cannot help but feel
sorry for the Emperor.

289
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:35,907
Oh, I think he'll survive.

290
00:18:36,007 --> 00:18:39,574
Fire and fights will be
the highlights of Edo.

291
00:18:39,674 --> 00:18:42,140
To be honest, madam,
I've never heard of it.

292
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:45,340
[Konzen] Goku! Goku!

293
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:48,174
What did you do
this time, monkey?!

294
00:18:48,307 --> 00:18:52,040
[Kenren] Hm?
[Tenpou] Ah! Looks like
your owner's arrived.

295
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:54,107
Hey, Konzen!

296
00:18:54,207 --> 00:18:56,474
Ah ha.

297
00:18:56,574 --> 00:18:59,607
So this is the guy, huh?

298
00:18:59,707 --> 00:19:01,340
[Konzen] Dammit!

299
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,040
I told you to stay close!

300
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:05,707
[Goku] I didn't mean to!

301
00:19:05,807 --> 00:19:09,540
Hey, give the kid a break.
Kids tend to wander off.

302
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:11,040
Hey, that happens.

303
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:13,140
Don't touch me!

304
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:14,574
Now who are you?

305
00:19:14,674 --> 00:19:16,840
I'm the unruly General.

306
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:20,407
The one with no command of
his groin or his liquor.

307
00:19:20,507 --> 00:19:23,040
So you're Kenren. Hmph.

308
00:19:23,874 --> 00:19:25,807
There you are, my lord Konzen!

309
00:19:25,907 --> 00:19:29,840
I was so very worried when
I couldn't find you at
your appointed seat!

310
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:32,574
Please return to
your place at once!

311
00:19:32,674 --> 00:19:33,707
[Konzen] Hmph.
[Attendant] Huh?

312
00:19:33,807 --> 00:19:35,707
I fear these three are with me,

313
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:39,907
so it looks like you'll
have to throw all four
of us out of this party.

314
00:19:40,007 --> 00:19:41,207
[Attendant] B-b-b-but, sir...

315
00:19:41,307 --> 00:19:42,674
Let's go.

316
00:19:42,774 --> 00:19:44,507
This was our fault.

317
00:19:44,607 --> 00:19:47,840
You don't need to be tied
up with us, you're innocent.

318
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:49,640
Hmph. On the bright side,

319
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:52,007
at least now I don't
have to be here.

320
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:03,807
<i>[Gojun] These four</i>
<i>are dangerous...</i>

321
00:20:07,207 --> 00:20:11,007
<i>[Goddess] Haha. Now you've</i>
<i>gone and done it, Konzen.</i>

322
00:20:11,107 --> 00:20:15,707
<i>You'll be tied up with</i>
<i>these three misfits</i>
<i>for some time to come.</i>

323
00:20:15,807 --> 00:20:19,407
<i>I can't wait to see what</i>
<i>kind of trouble you'll cause.</i>
