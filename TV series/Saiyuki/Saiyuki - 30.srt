1
00:01:44,108 --> 00:01:45,508
Looks like he's arrived.

2
00:01:56,442 --> 00:01:58,542
[Homura] Remove his shackles.

3
00:01:58,642 --> 00:02:00,742
But... but you can't be serious.

4
00:02:01,742 --> 00:02:03,575
[Homura] Just do it.

5
00:02:03,675 --> 00:02:05,208
[Both] Aye.

6
00:02:06,475 --> 00:02:09,675
I'm not quite sure if I
should thank you or not.

7
00:02:09,775 --> 00:02:12,475
Please don't. There's
no need for that.

8
00:02:12,575 --> 00:02:14,575
Then I apologize.

9
00:02:14,675 --> 00:02:16,608
Because although I am grateful,

10
00:02:16,708 --> 00:02:22,642
I'm afraid I'm going to
have to kill you and your
charming little companions.

11
00:02:22,742 --> 00:02:24,742
[Undertaker] Why
are you laughing?

12
00:02:24,842 --> 00:02:27,475
Why do you think we're
laughing, you moron?

13
00:02:27,575 --> 00:02:30,608
We're all laughing
because you're a joke.

14
00:02:30,708 --> 00:02:32,542
Oh, I'll show you funny.

15
00:02:32,642 --> 00:02:35,408
Well he does seem to
have spirit, Zenon.

16
00:02:35,908 --> 00:02:38,242
I tell you what.

17
00:02:38,342 --> 00:02:42,975
I'll make you a deal. If you
can touch us, we'll let you go.

18
00:02:43,075 --> 00:02:45,275
Okay, but be forewarned.

19
00:02:45,375 --> 00:02:47,808
I don't intend to
spare any of you.

20
00:02:50,075 --> 00:02:52,942
I won't show any mercy
once you're dead.

21
00:03:04,142 --> 00:03:06,342
[Shien] You shall now be reborn
as a holy demon in our service.

22
00:03:10,042 --> 00:03:12,675
Confer divinity.

23
00:03:14,875 --> 00:03:16,008
So it is done.

24
00:03:21,875 --> 00:03:23,842
You have but one command.

25
00:03:23,942 --> 00:03:28,108
To obtain the Maten Scripture
priest Genjo Sanzo wears.

26
00:03:28,975 --> 00:03:30,108
Go.

27
00:03:31,042 --> 00:03:32,675
Yes. Your wish is my command.

28
00:03:36,842 --> 00:03:39,808
You really think he
can pull it off?

29
00:03:39,908 --> 00:03:43,242
He's been strengthened,
but that's no guarantee.

30
00:03:43,342 --> 00:03:44,808
We shall see.

31
00:03:44,908 --> 00:03:48,142
It seems like a decent
place to start.

32
00:03:48,242 --> 00:03:50,275
<i>Isn't that right, Son Goku?</i>

33
00:03:56,242 --> 00:03:58,542
[Goku] "An Invitation to Hell."

34
00:04:05,242 --> 00:04:06,542
[Gojyo] I'm exhausted.

35
00:04:06,642 --> 00:04:10,008
I can't even muster enough
energy to punch Goku.

36
00:04:10,108 --> 00:04:13,175
[Goku] That would piss me off
if I weren't so damn hungry.

37
00:04:13,275 --> 00:04:16,642
Hold tight. We'll be
in town soon enough.

38
00:04:16,742 --> 00:04:18,908
So just be a little
patient, okay?

39
00:04:19,008 --> 00:04:20,542
[Gojyo & Goku] Alright.

40
00:04:21,508 --> 00:04:23,275
[Sanzo] You guys wear me out.

41
00:04:25,608 --> 00:04:28,375
[Gojyo] I don't know, this
town's a little too quiet.

42
00:04:29,442 --> 00:04:31,942
I don't understand,
where are all the people?

43
00:04:32,042 --> 00:04:35,108
Maybe everybody's
just on vacation.

44
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:36,675
Yeah, right!

45
00:04:36,775 --> 00:04:40,242
That hurt! I was serious!

46
00:04:40,342 --> 00:04:42,642
I know you were.

47
00:04:42,742 --> 00:04:44,975
Something here is wrong.

48
00:04:45,075 --> 00:04:46,475
I think you're right, Sanzo.

49
00:04:46,575 --> 00:04:48,775
I don't even see any
animals around here.

50
00:04:50,275 --> 00:04:52,875
Look there! See?

51
00:04:52,975 --> 00:04:55,375
Got a problem with wells, dude?

52
00:04:55,475 --> 00:04:57,408
There's no water, Goku.

53
00:04:57,508 --> 00:05:00,575
Don't you see? Even the
ditches have all dried up.

54
00:05:00,675 --> 00:05:04,642
And not a single plant to
be found anywhere. Nothing.

55
00:05:04,742 --> 00:05:07,342
At the very least, you
ought to see a weed.

56
00:05:07,442 --> 00:05:09,108
Must be a ghost town.

57
00:05:09,208 --> 00:05:11,075
[Sanzo] Wrong.

58
00:05:11,175 --> 00:05:13,742
The buildings look as
if they're brand new.

59
00:05:13,842 --> 00:05:15,542
They're all on vacation.

60
00:05:25,008 --> 00:05:26,175
[Gojyo] Is this a joke?

61
00:05:26,275 --> 00:05:28,142
[Hakkai] They look like coffins.

62
00:05:29,675 --> 00:05:32,175
I don't like this.

63
00:05:32,275 --> 00:05:35,342
[Undertaker] Welcome
to my little utopia.

64
00:05:39,675 --> 00:05:42,142
Do you like them?

65
00:05:42,242 --> 00:05:45,908
I made them especially for
you four fine gentlemen.

66
00:05:47,108 --> 00:05:49,742
I do hope I got the sizes right.

67
00:05:51,542 --> 00:05:52,675
Why you-!

68
00:05:53,542 --> 00:05:55,942
Where are the townspeople?

69
00:05:56,042 --> 00:05:58,075
Washed away.

70
00:05:58,175 --> 00:06:00,242
"Washed away?"

71
00:06:00,342 --> 00:06:02,975
They made such a
clutter, you see.

72
00:06:03,075 --> 00:06:06,675
So I thought I'd just tidy
up the place a little bit.

73
00:06:06,775 --> 00:06:08,942
What's his deal? Weirdo.

74
00:06:09,042 --> 00:06:10,575
Oh, who knows?

75
00:06:10,675 --> 00:06:14,575
Hey, maybe the heat's
fried his brain, ya think?

76
00:06:14,675 --> 00:06:17,575
[Undertaker] I'm afraid your
bravado will not save you.

77
00:06:17,675 --> 00:06:18,775
Why?

78
00:06:18,875 --> 00:06:22,875
Because it is your fate
to die by my hand.

79
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:24,375
Afraid not!

80
00:06:26,875 --> 00:06:29,442
If you will allow me...

81
00:06:29,542 --> 00:06:31,875
to introduce myself.

82
00:06:31,975 --> 00:06:34,275
I am the Undertaker.

83
00:06:34,375 --> 00:06:36,242
That's what my friends call me.

84
00:06:36,342 --> 00:06:38,475
But you can call
me what you like.

85
00:06:38,575 --> 00:06:41,342
You'll still end up
in these coffins.

86
00:06:41,442 --> 00:06:43,742
Until then, enjoy your stay.

87
00:07:15,142 --> 00:07:17,642
So, what do we do?

88
00:07:17,742 --> 00:07:21,942
Mr. Six-Feet-Under does seem
pretty intent on killing us.

89
00:07:22,042 --> 00:07:25,475
[Sanzo] I won't let
him ruin my pool game.

90
00:07:25,575 --> 00:07:28,108
Besides, he knows
where to find us.

91
00:07:28,208 --> 00:07:30,008
No doubt about that.

92
00:07:30,108 --> 00:07:32,275
What do you think happened
to all those villagers?

93
00:07:32,375 --> 00:07:34,842
That's the one question
I'd like answered.

94
00:07:34,942 --> 00:07:37,542
[Goku] He killed them.

95
00:07:37,642 --> 00:07:39,742
I can smell their blood.

96
00:07:41,408 --> 00:07:46,642
Now what kind of bar
doesn't serve any alcohol?

97
00:07:46,742 --> 00:07:48,542
Not very hospitable, is it?

98
00:07:58,075 --> 00:08:00,608
[Goku] Why isn't there any food?

99
00:08:00,708 --> 00:08:02,742
Not even on the ground! Man...

100
00:08:07,308 --> 00:08:09,008
Found some!

101
00:08:09,108 --> 00:08:10,608
There's no way.

102
00:08:14,775 --> 00:08:17,342
Yum! Here I come!

103
00:08:21,208 --> 00:08:23,708
[Undertaker] You'll be a simple
one to catch, won't you?

104
00:08:26,775 --> 00:08:30,108
Your appetites make it
so easy to ensnare you.

105
00:08:32,842 --> 00:08:35,908
That little... The next time
I see him, I'm gonna...!

106
00:08:38,308 --> 00:08:42,542
I won't stop looking
until I find some food!

107
00:08:42,642 --> 00:08:45,242
Oh, you will, huh? What's new?

108
00:08:47,508 --> 00:08:50,842
So are we having fun yet?

109
00:08:50,942 --> 00:08:53,742
You bet. This is
the time of my life.

110
00:08:53,842 --> 00:08:57,142
Is that right? So
glad to hear it.

111
00:08:57,242 --> 00:09:01,108
So tell me, do you kill people
by annoying them to death?

112
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:02,675
You stupid retard!

113
00:09:04,042 --> 00:09:07,675
I told you, I like
to keep things tidy.

114
00:09:07,775 --> 00:09:12,142
So I rid of anything that marred
this town's perfect beauty.

115
00:09:12,242 --> 00:09:17,042
But don't fret. You and
your friends will all be
joining them soon enough.

116
00:09:17,142 --> 00:09:19,308
That so?

117
00:09:19,408 --> 00:09:24,108
[Undertaker] Don't
even think about it!

118
00:09:24,208 --> 00:09:26,975
Ah, that was my last pack!

119
00:09:27,075 --> 00:09:28,942
Oh relax, pinky.

120
00:09:29,042 --> 00:09:30,942
You know it's your
health I'm worried about.

121
00:09:31,042 --> 00:09:32,808
You should thank me.

122
00:09:33,608 --> 00:09:34,908
Listen.

123
00:09:35,008 --> 00:09:38,375
Four people before you
asked me to quit smoking.

124
00:09:38,475 --> 00:09:41,175
Do you wanna know
what happened to them?

125
00:09:41,275 --> 00:09:42,908
No.

126
00:09:43,008 --> 00:09:45,475
I killed every last one.

127
00:09:49,008 --> 00:09:53,375
That's enough. I told you
once before, I like to
keep things tidy.

128
00:09:53,475 --> 00:09:54,508
Don't push it.

129
00:09:54,608 --> 00:09:56,342
[Gojyo] You crossed the line.

130
00:09:58,642 --> 00:09:59,908
[Sanzo] What do you think?

131
00:10:00,008 --> 00:10:02,575
[Hakkai] I haven't really
formed an opinion yet.

132
00:10:02,675 --> 00:10:06,708
It's one thing to try to use
your lightning quick wit, but...

133
00:10:06,808 --> 00:10:11,042
You don't like his
theatrics, do you?

134
00:10:11,142 --> 00:10:12,075
That's right.

135
00:10:14,342 --> 00:10:16,042
Sanzo, look!

136
00:10:19,442 --> 00:10:22,208
Looks like the funeral
preparations are underway.

137
00:10:22,308 --> 00:10:24,175
This guy annoys me.

138
00:10:24,275 --> 00:10:25,842
[Undertaker] What's the matter?

139
00:10:25,942 --> 00:10:29,575
Doesn't my captive audience
like my little performance?

140
00:10:29,675 --> 00:10:30,575
He's back.

141
00:10:30,675 --> 00:10:32,508
We're on schedule.

142
00:10:32,608 --> 00:10:35,908
Come morning, your funeral
will start as planned.

143
00:10:36,008 --> 00:10:39,975
Sorry, but I was never
very big on these kinds
of formal affairs.

144
00:10:40,075 --> 00:10:42,808
Never was one to keep
schedules either.

145
00:10:47,775 --> 00:10:50,242
[Undertaker] Ah-ah-ah!
Not so fast.

146
00:10:57,508 --> 00:10:58,842
[Hakkai] Hakuryu!

147
00:10:58,942 --> 00:11:00,742
[Undertaker] You let
your guard down.

148
00:11:13,742 --> 00:11:15,675
[Hakkai] Are you all right?!

149
00:11:15,775 --> 00:11:18,142
[Hakuryu squeaks pitifully]

150
00:11:22,207 --> 00:11:24,888
[Hakkai] Hakuryu!
Are you all right?

151
00:11:24,888 --> 00:11:26,521
Hakuryu!

152
00:11:27,621 --> 00:11:29,255
I'm was so...

153
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:30,888
stupid for not seeing that move.

154
00:11:37,755 --> 00:11:40,321
Thank God. At least
it's not serious.

155
00:11:41,688 --> 00:11:45,755
But to attack a poor,
defenseless creature
like that... man.

156
00:11:45,855 --> 00:11:47,488
I know.

157
00:11:50,388 --> 00:11:55,388
So they don't have water,
or people, but how can
a town have no food?!

158
00:11:55,488 --> 00:11:59,921
There are no cigarettes,
no liquor, and no women.

159
00:12:00,021 --> 00:12:03,688
Augh! That's it! I
say we blow this town!

160
00:12:03,788 --> 00:12:04,455
Don't wanna.

161
00:12:04,555 --> 00:12:05,555
Why not?!

162
00:12:05,655 --> 00:12:07,588
You've got to be joking, man.

163
00:12:07,688 --> 00:12:11,088
You want us to take off after
the way he mocked us?

164
00:12:11,188 --> 00:12:12,055
Right, monk?

165
00:12:12,155 --> 00:12:14,388
Huh. You got that right.

166
00:12:14,488 --> 00:12:16,588
Besides, he's no moron.

167
00:12:16,688 --> 00:12:21,055
I'm sure he's taken care
of that contingency already.

168
00:12:21,155 --> 00:12:26,055
At the very least, I bet he
put up a wall or something
to keep us here in this town.

169
00:12:28,021 --> 00:12:30,421
It's such an eerie
feeling though.

170
00:12:30,521 --> 00:12:34,055
How he actually seems to
anticipate our every move.

171
00:12:34,155 --> 00:12:36,255
That's not hard with these two.

172
00:12:36,355 --> 00:12:37,821
[Gojyo & Goku] What did
you say?!

173
00:12:42,755 --> 00:12:45,488
They're so unbelievably
predictable.

174
00:12:45,588 --> 00:12:48,955
But the show is far from over.

175
00:12:49,055 --> 00:12:52,321
The curtain has just
raised on my little play.

176
00:12:58,888 --> 00:13:00,521
Hey, Sanzo.

177
00:13:01,455 --> 00:13:03,088
Lend me a smoke, will ya?

178
00:13:03,188 --> 00:13:04,155
No way.

179
00:13:04,255 --> 00:13:05,655
Don't be such a Scrooge!

180
00:13:05,755 --> 00:13:07,755
I've gotta have my fix, man!

181
00:13:07,855 --> 00:13:09,888
If memory serves me correctly,

182
00:13:09,988 --> 00:13:13,955
I seem to recall someone saying
my smokes tasted like shit.

183
00:13:14,055 --> 00:13:17,688
I need nicotine right
now! Cough 'em up!

184
00:13:17,788 --> 00:13:22,821
Let go of me. That is,
if you want to live,
you red-haired fairy.

185
00:13:22,921 --> 00:13:25,355
I NEED NICOTINE!

186
00:13:25,455 --> 00:13:28,855
Okay, I think it's time to
give it a rest, you guys.

187
00:13:30,855 --> 00:13:33,455
This is exactly what
he wants us to do.

188
00:13:37,855 --> 00:13:40,121
You bastard!

189
00:13:40,688 --> 00:13:42,621
You son of a...

190
00:13:42,721 --> 00:13:45,655
Hey, you guys. I think
I may be hallucinating.

191
00:13:45,788 --> 00:13:49,288
I see a plate of meatbuns
right there in front of me.

192
00:13:49,388 --> 00:13:52,755
You're not nuts. We all
see it there too, Goku.

193
00:13:52,855 --> 00:13:54,288
Hey! So it is real!

194
00:13:54,388 --> 00:13:56,055
Oh, I didn't say that.

195
00:13:56,155 --> 00:13:57,588
Look around.

196
00:13:59,221 --> 00:14:00,955
[Goku] What is this?

197
00:14:01,055 --> 00:14:03,188
[Gojyo] It's just another
one of his magic tricks.

198
00:14:03,288 --> 00:14:05,121
A rather elaborate one at that.

199
00:14:05,588 --> 00:14:06,721
[Goku] Hmm.

200
00:14:08,055 --> 00:14:09,621
Alright! Look alive, barkeep!

201
00:14:09,721 --> 00:14:12,388
Just serve me anything,
so long as I can eat it!

202
00:14:12,488 --> 00:14:14,688
It's not real, stupid monkey!

203
00:14:29,521 --> 00:14:31,021
It's you!

204
00:14:31,121 --> 00:14:33,455
[Sanzo] Don't, they're
an illusion too.

205
00:14:49,121 --> 00:14:52,221
[Goku] Stop it!
Stop it! Stop it!

206
00:14:52,921 --> 00:14:54,688
Hm. That's quite a show.

207
00:14:54,788 --> 00:14:57,755
It is, but I don't care much
for his ubject matter.

208
00:14:57,855 --> 00:15:00,788
That's way too gory for me.

209
00:15:00,888 --> 00:15:02,888
Ah-huh. I don't know
about you gentlemen,

210
00:15:02,988 --> 00:15:05,855
but I say we close the curtains
on this three-penny opera.

211
00:15:05,955 --> 00:15:07,721
But how do we do that?

212
00:15:07,821 --> 00:15:10,555
That's my job.
Mr. Six-Feet-Under's

213
00:15:10,655 --> 00:15:13,321
not the only one who can
play games around here.

214
00:15:15,821 --> 00:15:22,355
[Goku] "With My Compliments".

215
00:15:22,455 --> 00:15:24,055
The tables turn.

216
00:15:24,155 --> 00:15:27,588
Wait till that neat
freak gets a load of
this little embellishment.

217
00:15:27,688 --> 00:15:30,921
[Hakkai hums as he
defaces property]

218
00:15:31,021 --> 00:15:34,521
Hey, Sanzo. Tell me, do you
think he'll really come?

219
00:15:34,621 --> 00:15:37,821
Oh yeah. This is his
town, after all.

220
00:15:39,288 --> 00:15:40,921
[Undertaker] Stop it!

221
00:15:42,221 --> 00:15:43,255
[Sanzo] Told you.

222
00:15:43,355 --> 00:15:44,688
[Goku] That was quick.

223
00:15:49,355 --> 00:15:52,088
Stop it! You've
ruined my village!

224
00:15:52,188 --> 00:15:54,921
Ruined it! You ruined it!

225
00:15:55,021 --> 00:15:57,755
[Sanzo] Why don't you come
down here and make us stop?!

226
00:16:03,688 --> 00:16:07,288
Yeah, and you better hurry.
There won't be much of
your village left.

227
00:16:10,655 --> 00:16:15,555
Just stop it. This is my
village. This is my utopia.

228
00:16:19,155 --> 00:16:20,455
Alright then.

229
00:16:20,555 --> 00:16:24,421
If that's the way you little
boys want it, I'll clean house.

230
00:16:33,421 --> 00:16:35,088
I think he heard.

231
00:16:35,188 --> 00:16:37,755
This time for real, I hope.

232
00:16:37,855 --> 00:16:42,421
No need to worry. It's
really me this time.

233
00:16:42,521 --> 00:16:45,888
I sure hope those coffins
come in your size!

234
00:16:45,988 --> 00:16:48,721
[Undertaker] You couldn't
kill me, little one.

235
00:16:48,821 --> 00:16:52,821
I say it's time we show this
guy who he picked a fight with.

236
00:16:52,921 --> 00:16:56,288
He's going to regret
this, I guarantee it.

237
00:16:56,388 --> 00:16:59,021
You're going to be the
ones who'll be sorry.

238
00:16:59,121 --> 00:17:03,588
You could have had the
chance to at least live
until the morning.

239
00:17:03,688 --> 00:17:05,355
[Goku] We'll live
longer than that!

240
00:17:12,855 --> 00:17:16,988
Looks like you're pretty good
at hopping around, little bunny.

241
00:17:17,088 --> 00:17:18,221
Dodge this!

242
00:17:22,155 --> 00:17:25,121
[Undertaker] You're
so thick headed.

243
00:17:25,221 --> 00:17:28,055
Who're you calling thick
headed, you jerk?!

244
00:17:28,155 --> 00:17:29,955
[Undertaker] Why you, of course.

245
00:17:31,821 --> 00:17:32,955
[Gojyo cries out in pain]

246
00:17:36,955 --> 00:17:38,288
Bastard!

247
00:17:38,388 --> 00:17:42,188
Don't bother. You can't hit me.

248
00:17:42,288 --> 00:17:45,455
I'm much too fast for
you and your friends.

249
00:17:47,455 --> 00:17:51,621
I know every move you're going
to make before you even make it.

250
00:17:51,721 --> 00:17:53,555
And I know what you're thinking-

251
00:17:55,221 --> 00:17:58,088
I've had about enough of
your self-promotional crap.

252
00:17:58,188 --> 00:18:02,288
Taking advantage of a bunch
of traveling morons is
nothing to brag about.

253
00:18:02,388 --> 00:18:05,821
[Undertaker] You tore my jacket.

254
00:18:05,921 --> 00:18:09,388
I'll kill you. I'll kill you!

255
00:18:09,488 --> 00:18:11,488
I'll kill you!

256
00:18:14,955 --> 00:18:16,455
[Sanzo] Nice job.
[Hakkai] Thanks.

257
00:18:16,555 --> 00:18:19,655
These stupid coffins are
beginning to annoy me.

258
00:18:19,755 --> 00:18:22,221
[Sanzo] He can use them as
either shields or weapons.

259
00:18:22,321 --> 00:18:23,488
Rather troublesome.

260
00:18:24,455 --> 00:18:26,321
Which means we should...

261
00:18:28,155 --> 00:18:29,288
Here goes!

262
00:18:32,588 --> 00:18:33,988
[Sanzo] There's my opening!

263
00:18:40,121 --> 00:18:44,221
I told you I knew what
you were thinking before
you even thought it.

264
00:18:44,321 --> 00:18:47,921
Goku, Gojyo, can either of
you destroy those coffins?!

265
00:18:48,021 --> 00:18:50,755
[Gojyo] Right, he'll have
nothing to protect him then.

266
00:18:50,855 --> 00:18:53,021
[Goku] Then let's
get to it, Gojyo!

267
00:18:55,121 --> 00:18:58,321
Good luck. They won't
break that easily.

268
00:18:58,421 --> 00:18:59,555
[Undertaker gasp]

269
00:19:00,955 --> 00:19:02,588
It's my turn.

270
00:19:05,721 --> 00:19:06,888
<i>[Undertaker] Impossible!</i>

271
00:19:06,988 --> 00:19:09,455
Time for a little
spring cleaning.

272
00:19:09,555 --> 00:19:13,221
No, don't! Stay back!
Keep away from me!

273
00:19:13,321 --> 00:19:14,788
And this one is for...

274
00:19:14,888 --> 00:19:16,855
not having any food, jackass!

275
00:19:23,321 --> 00:19:24,888
And this one...

276
00:19:24,988 --> 00:19:27,521
is for your no smoking policy.

277
00:19:31,921 --> 00:19:34,488
[Hakkai] It's okay. I'm
not holding a grudge.

278
00:19:38,821 --> 00:19:41,155
[Sanzo] Looks like I'm next.

279
00:19:41,255 --> 00:19:47,088
Maten Scripture, I call upon
you to use your power to
cast my enemy back into...

280
00:19:47,188 --> 00:19:48,688
OBLIVION!

281
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:51,455
[Undertaker] HOMURA!

282
00:19:51,555 --> 00:19:53,955
[Sanzo] You messed
with the wrong guys.

283
00:19:58,588 --> 00:19:59,588
What did he say?!

284
00:19:59,688 --> 00:20:01,588
Homura! He said Homura!

285
00:20:11,042 --> 00:20:13,083
Is it still bothering
you, Sanzo?

286
00:20:13,083 --> 00:20:14,750
A little.

287
00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:16,850
Man, talk about a shithole.

288
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:19,983
I thought I was going to go
crazy in that stupid dump.

289
00:20:20,083 --> 00:20:23,350
Same here. That place
was pure hell, man.

290
00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:26,083
It was a dry county, and no
smoking section to be found.

291
00:20:27,383 --> 00:20:29,450
Maybe that's exactly
what Heaven's like.

292
00:20:29,550 --> 00:20:33,417
No way! Then I'd rather
have a table downstairs.

293
00:20:33,517 --> 00:20:34,650
[Sanzo] Too late.

294
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:37,317
I know exactly where
we're all going.

295
00:20:37,417 --> 00:20:41,050
So, it's Hell after
all then, eh?

296
00:20:41,150 --> 00:20:42,383
Nope.

297
00:20:44,583 --> 00:20:45,717
West!
