1
00:01:36,573 --> 00:01:40,436
[Sanzo] If you meet the
Buddha, kill the Buddha.

2
00:01:40,436 --> 00:01:44,614
If you meet your father,
kill your father.

3
00:01:44,614 --> 00:01:47,414
Free of everything, you
are bound by nothing.

4
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:51,214
Live the life that
is given to you.

5
00:02:09,647 --> 00:02:11,614
Sanzo, can you give me a light?

6
00:02:14,047 --> 00:02:14,747
Thank you.

7
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,414
Wise guy.

8
00:02:18,514 --> 00:02:19,280
Something wrong?

9
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:20,747
It's not working!

10
00:02:20,847 --> 00:02:23,414
Yeah, well, it doesn't
have a flint.

11
00:02:23,514 --> 00:02:27,080
What?! Then it's absolutely
useless to me!

12
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:29,347
That's why I gave it to you.

13
00:02:29,447 --> 00:02:31,114
Oh yeah, that's real funny.

14
00:02:31,214 --> 00:02:35,247
Now, now, we'll pick up a new
lighter at the next store.

15
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:39,414
Then wake up Hakuryu will
you, so we can get moving.

16
00:02:39,514 --> 00:02:42,947
I would love to, but I'm
afraid Hakuryu needs his rest.

17
00:02:47,547 --> 00:02:49,480
Will you stop snoring? Brat.

18
00:02:54,914 --> 00:02:56,714
A shooting star.

19
00:03:04,547 --> 00:03:07,380
[Goku] " Descends,
the Prince of War".

20
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:42,680
[Driver] Is everyone okay?!

21
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:44,614
[Man] I think so...

22
00:03:46,314 --> 00:03:47,947
What the hell is that?

23
00:03:55,347 --> 00:03:57,880
[Zenon] Heh. Look at how
frightened they are.

24
00:03:57,980 --> 00:03:59,114
[Shien] As expected.

25
00:04:02,914 --> 00:04:06,180
[Zenon] Hey, we got
a question for you.

26
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:09,247
We're on the lookout for
four men, you seen 'em?

27
00:04:11,947 --> 00:04:14,480
You don't say?
Sorry to hear that.

28
00:04:30,147 --> 00:04:32,414
You are so brutal.

29
00:04:32,514 --> 00:04:36,714
What's your problem? That
worthless group of migrants
is nothing, man.

30
00:04:36,814 --> 00:04:39,347
Compared to the number
we're gonna kill.

31
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,280
I'll be.

32
00:04:48,414 --> 00:04:50,714
Those guys sure had some nerve.

33
00:04:50,814 --> 00:04:54,647
I seriously doubt they had any
idea who they were messing with.

34
00:04:59,814 --> 00:05:03,547
Problem with Chinese
food is that you're
hungry a minute later.

35
00:05:05,414 --> 00:05:08,614
We're lucky we could even find
a place that was open this late.

36
00:05:08,714 --> 00:05:11,214
Lucky? This food sucks.

37
00:05:11,314 --> 00:05:13,080
If everyone's done.

38
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:16,114
I vote we all leave
this loser dive.

39
00:05:16,214 --> 00:05:19,047
Hey. What are you calling
a "dive", you asshole?

40
00:05:19,147 --> 00:05:21,514
I was referring to this place.

41
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:25,147
It's all friends and family.

42
00:05:25,247 --> 00:05:26,880
Who else would eat here?

43
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,514
Oh no, here we go again.

44
00:05:31,614 --> 00:05:34,614
And what exactly is
wrong with my place?

45
00:05:34,714 --> 00:05:38,147
[Sanzo] For starters, I'd
have to say it's the smell.

46
00:05:38,247 --> 00:05:39,380
What smell is that?

47
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:42,514
Can't tell if it's
the food or the company.

48
00:05:42,614 --> 00:05:45,314
Alright smartass! I've had
just about enough of you!

49
00:05:45,414 --> 00:05:46,547
[Restaurant door opens]

50
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,114
[Restaurant door closes]

51
00:06:03,047 --> 00:06:04,847
<i>[Sanzo] Those two...</i>

52
00:06:06,147 --> 00:06:08,147
[Zenon] A shot
of your strongest.

53
00:06:08,247 --> 00:06:09,414
[Shien] Oolong tea.

54
00:06:09,514 --> 00:06:10,747
Right away

55
00:06:10,847 --> 00:06:12,180
Looks like them

56
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,914
It appears that way.

57
00:06:19,047 --> 00:06:21,914
Hey man, I don't suppose
you could give me a light?

58
00:06:22,947 --> 00:06:24,714
Yeah, sure. What the hell?

59
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:30,814
You're a real pal

60
00:06:30,914 --> 00:06:33,847
It just ain't the same without
my after-dinner smoke.

61
00:06:33,947 --> 00:06:36,014
Well, let's hit the roar

62
00:06:36,114 --> 00:06:37,214
Yeah, let's.

63
00:06:37,314 --> 00:06:38,480
[Owner] Not so fast!

64
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:40,480
So how much?

65
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:45,447
I might not have been
able to eat that crap,
but I always pay my bills.

66
00:06:45,547 --> 00:06:50,747
You got that right! You're
gonna pay for it alright,
and I mean big time!

67
00:06:50,847 --> 00:06:54,414
What the hell kind of place
are you running here?

68
00:06:54,514 --> 00:06:58,514
Can't a guy have a drink
without having to listen
to all this bullshit?

69
00:06:58,614 --> 00:07:00,547
[Owner] Butt out! This
doesn't concern you.

70
00:07:00,647 --> 00:07:03,114
[Zenon] Doesn't concern us?

71
00:07:03,214 --> 00:07:05,814
Why, everything concerns us.

72
00:07:05,914 --> 00:07:09,114
And I don't particularly care
for demons stench either.

73
00:07:09,214 --> 00:07:10,880
Who the hell do
you think you are?!

74
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,980
Why, I think we're gods.

75
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,580
That dude's a god?

76
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,180
[Gojyo] If he says so.

77
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,847
Gods, he says!

78
00:07:24,947 --> 00:07:26,347
This guy's killing me!

79
00:07:26,447 --> 00:07:28,747
Talk about your delusions
of grandeur.

80
00:07:28,847 --> 00:07:33,580
My only delusions was thinking
I could drink this after
seeing your face.

81
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,880
What?

82
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:38,814
Goku, he can't help
how he looks.

83
00:07:38,914 --> 00:07:42,514
I was wondering why there were
no women around here, yanno?

84
00:07:42,614 --> 00:07:44,147
I don't think I like them.

85
00:07:45,247 --> 00:07:46,414
That isn't good.

86
00:07:46,514 --> 00:07:48,214
You asked for it!

87
00:07:57,114 --> 00:07:58,414
That does it!

88
00:07:59,647 --> 00:08:03,247
Striking. You should try that
look a little more often.

89
00:08:06,214 --> 00:08:09,114
You're gonna regret
you did that.

90
00:08:09,247 --> 00:08:12,747
[Zenon] So you keep tellin'
me. Let's get on with it.

91
00:08:12,847 --> 00:08:19,147
Word of warning. Something
about demons always rubbed
me the wrong way.

92
00:08:19,247 --> 00:08:21,414
Every time I see one...

93
00:08:21,514 --> 00:08:24,747
all I want to do is send
'em straight to hell!

94
00:08:26,414 --> 00:08:28,014
What the hell is he?

95
00:08:28,114 --> 00:08:32,547
He sure doesn't act like
a demon, that's for sure.
I can tell you that much.

96
00:08:32,647 --> 00:08:35,780
So I guess he is a
real god then, right?

97
00:08:38,247 --> 00:08:39,880
[Shien] Another cup, please.

98
00:08:41,114 --> 00:08:43,814
I said pour me another cup.

99
00:08:43,914 --> 00:08:44,880
[Bartender] Yes, Sir.

100
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:47,047
Aren't these two
guys just assassins?

101
00:08:47,147 --> 00:08:49,514
I feel like we should
be helping them.

102
00:08:49,614 --> 00:08:53,180
I do to, but it looks like
to me like these two can

103
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:55,747
handle this whole bar of
demons without our help.

104
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:01,080
[Sanzo] Let's go.

105
00:09:03,914 --> 00:09:05,047
[Gojyo] Huh?

106
00:09:06,314 --> 00:09:09,480
Well, if it isn't Genjo Sanzo.

107
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:10,947
Time to die!

108
00:09:11,047 --> 00:09:13,814
[Hakkai] They didn't
drive all this way just
to see us, did they?

109
00:09:13,914 --> 00:09:18,447
I'm not so sure that
truck is road worthy.

110
00:09:18,547 --> 00:09:22,280
How much do you want to
bet they had to push that
thing all the way here?

111
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:24,914
I thought we ditched this crowd.

112
00:09:25,014 --> 00:09:27,847
I could use a little
after-dinner workout!

113
00:09:28,614 --> 00:09:30,280
Do we have to?

114
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:33,147
C'mon. It'll aid the digestion.

115
00:09:33,247 --> 00:09:35,380
[Rapid gunfire]

116
00:09:44,714 --> 00:09:46,480
Hmph. Too easy.

117
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:50,747
Are you quite finished? We have
more important task, Zenon.

118
00:09:51,647 --> 00:09:54,880
Huh. Don't worry, I
haven't forgotten.

119
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:59,280
You're the one, who takes care
of them in the end, am I right?

120
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:01,014
That's true.

121
00:10:24,714 --> 00:10:26,347
What foolishness.

122
00:10:33,447 --> 00:10:34,980
Go get them!

123
00:10:44,114 --> 00:10:45,714
What's going on here?

124
00:11:08,947 --> 00:11:10,280
[Zenon] He has arrived.

125
00:11:20,714 --> 00:11:22,214
How I've waited for this.

126
00:11:27,247 --> 00:11:31,014
So nice to see
you again, Konzen.

127
00:11:40,241 --> 00:11:43,075
It's been such a long
time, hasn't it?

128
00:11:53,708 --> 00:11:56,041
Konzen, have you
forgotten your time...

129
00:11:57,075 --> 00:11:58,808
in Heaven?

130
00:12:03,875 --> 00:12:05,441
That name...

131
00:12:05,575 --> 00:12:10,808
<i>I've heard that name</i>
<i>before. The night Sanzo</i>
<i>was struck down by Rikudo.</i>

132
00:12:10,908 --> 00:12:16,875
When Goku broke his golden
coronet, we were unable to
stop his murderous rampage.

133
00:12:16,975 --> 00:12:21,241
Then the Merciful Goddess
descended upon us. I
remember her speaking.

134
00:12:23,708 --> 00:12:27,808
Well.

135
00:12:27,908 --> 00:12:31,275
You aren't going to like
this, Konzen Douji.

136
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:34,608
Or should I call you
Genjo Sanzo, now?

137
00:12:36,975 --> 00:12:40,141
<i>[Hakkai] Yes. that's the</i>
<i>name she used, all right.</i>

138
00:12:40,241 --> 00:12:44,108
<i>I'm sure of it. She called</i>
<i>him "Konzen Douji."</i>

139
00:12:47,675 --> 00:12:49,308
His right eye...

140
00:12:50,375 --> 00:12:51,875
It's just like mine.

141
00:12:54,408 --> 00:13:01,141
It's true. In ancient times
those with golden eyes were
said to be a source of fortune.

142
00:13:01,241 --> 00:13:04,841
It appears that you and I
are heretics, so in a way,

143
00:13:04,941 --> 00:13:08,075
we are brothers, my dear Goku.

144
00:13:08,175 --> 00:13:11,808
Well. You sure do dish
out a lot of crap, man.

145
00:13:11,941 --> 00:13:14,508
Now tell us, who
the hell are you?

146
00:13:14,608 --> 00:13:16,608
I am the War Prince, Homura.

147
00:13:16,708 --> 00:13:19,175
[Homura] At your service.
<i>[Sanzo] War Prince?</i>

148
00:13:19,275 --> 00:13:23,708
I'm hurt that you would forget
me so soon, General Kenren.

149
00:13:23,808 --> 00:13:25,908
What the hell did you call me?

150
00:13:26,008 --> 00:13:30,775
Are you and your friends
in any way related to
the Merciful Goddess?

151
00:13:30,875 --> 00:13:36,208
Well, well. At least
you have not completely
forgotten your past...

152
00:13:36,308 --> 00:13:38,408
Eh, Field Marshal Tenpou?

153
00:13:41,908 --> 00:13:46,275
[Zenon] Homura. When are you
going to quit babbling and
tell them why you're here?

154
00:13:47,241 --> 00:13:48,808
As you wish.

155
00:13:48,908 --> 00:13:50,175
I'm listening.

156
00:13:50,275 --> 00:13:52,841
Well my friend, it is now time.

157
00:13:52,941 --> 00:13:57,841
So please, hand over what you
posses. The Maten scripture.

158
00:13:59,075 --> 00:14:00,475
[Sanzo] Not likely.

159
00:14:00,575 --> 00:14:01,875
[Homura] Then I'll kill you.

160
00:14:01,975 --> 00:14:03,775
Huh. You're welcome to try.

161
00:14:05,041 --> 00:14:07,908
How did I know you'd say that?

162
00:14:18,541 --> 00:14:19,875
<i>[Gojyo] He's fast.</i>

163
00:14:19,975 --> 00:14:21,575
No! Sanzo!

164
00:14:24,508 --> 00:14:25,841
This is not your fight.

165
00:14:25,941 --> 00:14:27,841
<i>[Goku] What...</i>

166
00:14:27,941 --> 00:14:30,408
<i>How could I have not</i>
<i>felt his presence?</i>

167
00:14:31,641 --> 00:14:33,275
Same goes for you guys.

168
00:14:35,608 --> 00:14:39,108
What do you plan to do
with the Scripture?!

169
00:14:39,208 --> 00:14:41,241
I'm going to
destroy the Heavens.

170
00:14:41,341 --> 00:14:45,141
The pampered palace where
those incompetent fools reside.

171
00:14:45,241 --> 00:14:46,541
Don't think so.

172
00:14:48,775 --> 00:14:49,908
Goodbye!

173
00:14:55,275 --> 00:14:58,675
[Sanzo] What?!
[Homura] You didn't really think
that gun would hurt me, did you?

174
00:14:59,341 --> 00:15:00,675
So you are...

175
00:15:00,775 --> 00:15:04,075
Oh, you're going to have to do a
lot better than that, my friend.

176
00:15:04,875 --> 00:15:07,041
So go ahead and shoot me.

177
00:15:07,141 --> 00:15:08,941
My heart's right here.

178
00:15:12,375 --> 00:15:14,941
Well, if you're too
cowardly, then...

179
00:15:15,041 --> 00:15:17,875
Zenon! Fire away.

180
00:15:21,675 --> 00:15:23,308
Sure thing, boss.

181
00:15:25,108 --> 00:15:27,775
<i>[Gojyo] He shouldn't stand a</i>
<i>chance against a gun like that.</i>

182
00:15:35,041 --> 00:15:40,341
So you see, it's not
so easy to kill gods.

183
00:15:40,441 --> 00:15:45,408
How very god-like of you. Wow.
To demonstrate your great power,

184
00:15:45,508 --> 00:15:48,375
then expect us to hand over
the scriptures to you.

185
00:15:48,475 --> 00:15:52,175
So why don't you kneel?
Kneel before me now.

186
00:15:52,941 --> 00:15:54,475
No thank you.

187
00:15:57,608 --> 00:16:01,275
Have faith only in what you
see with your own eyes.

188
00:16:01,375 --> 00:16:05,441
Feel with your own heart and
prove by your own strength.

189
00:16:05,541 --> 00:16:09,275
That is something I have
always admired about you.

190
00:16:09,375 --> 00:16:13,708
But to remain so defiant
now is plain vanity.

191
00:16:13,808 --> 00:16:18,741
Surely you don't think you could
have gotten this far unless it
was the will of the gods.

192
00:16:20,541 --> 00:16:23,208
It is time you
learned your place.

193
00:16:23,308 --> 00:16:25,208
Now hand over the scripture!

194
00:16:25,308 --> 00:16:28,675
Don't waste your
breath! I won't budge.

195
00:16:28,775 --> 00:16:30,875
Then I won't ask again.

196
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:33,775
But the next time
I draw my sword...

197
00:16:33,875 --> 00:16:35,308
I won't hold back!

198
00:16:35,408 --> 00:16:36,675
Sanzo!

199
00:16:46,275 --> 00:16:47,375
Stupid chimp!

200
00:16:49,308 --> 00:16:51,675
[Hakkai] I'll be.
[Gojyo] God damn.

201
00:16:51,775 --> 00:16:55,675
The little one, he... does not
seem to move as he did before.

202
00:16:55,775 --> 00:16:59,208
I don't get it why you
guys need the Scripture!

203
00:16:59,308 --> 00:17:01,808
[Homura] Stand back!
[Goku] I will not!

204
00:17:01,908 --> 00:17:04,708
<i>[Homura] Innocent eyes,</i>
<i>pure intentions...</i>

205
00:17:04,841 --> 00:17:08,941
<i>But this boy is also a</i>
<i>heretic, just like me.</i>

206
00:17:09,041 --> 00:17:12,875
<i>Seiten Taisei, Son Goku.</i>

207
00:17:12,975 --> 00:17:19,908
I'm afraid that none of you
gentlemen are quite at the
level to be of use to me.

208
00:17:20,008 --> 00:17:22,441
Hey, what's up with that?

209
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:25,808
[Hakkai] What's that about?
[Gojyo] Got me.

210
00:17:25,908 --> 00:17:27,675
You'll soon find out.

211
00:17:31,741 --> 00:17:33,575
Now what's going on?

212
00:17:34,575 --> 00:17:36,841
Hmph. Well if it isn't
the tour group.

213
00:17:36,941 --> 00:17:39,275
Aw man, not again!

214
00:17:39,408 --> 00:17:41,375
They sure as hell
sent a lot of them.

215
00:17:44,775 --> 00:17:46,841
[Demon 1] Hey look, he's
here. It's Genjo Sanzo.

216
00:17:48,541 --> 00:17:50,475
Hmph. Worthless scum.

217
00:18:05,541 --> 00:18:08,941
All those demons in the
blink of an eye? Shit.

218
00:18:09,041 --> 00:18:10,875
Gone, in an instant.

219
00:18:14,808 --> 00:18:16,675
Zenon, Shien!

220
00:18:16,775 --> 00:18:18,475
Yes?

221
00:18:19,708 --> 00:18:22,108
[Homura] Let's go.
[Zenon] You sure?

222
00:18:22,208 --> 00:18:23,875
[Homura] We will
withdraw for now.

223
00:18:24,908 --> 00:18:27,608
[Zenon] If you say so.
[Shien] I understand.

224
00:18:29,841 --> 00:18:31,341
Later guys.

225
00:18:31,441 --> 00:18:33,075
Hey, hold up.

226
00:18:34,275 --> 00:18:36,975
You got a light?

227
00:18:37,075 --> 00:18:41,975
Keep it. A little gift from
the gods. Take good care of it.

228
00:18:45,175 --> 00:18:46,841
No thanks.

229
00:18:56,408 --> 00:18:57,741
So long.

230
00:19:05,041 --> 00:19:06,675
Don't like them.

231
00:19:20,009 --> 00:19:22,490
Hey, wait! How did
you light that?!

232
00:19:22,490 --> 00:19:24,590
Where the hell's the lighter?!

233
00:19:24,690 --> 00:19:27,590
Remember? My lighter
didn't have a flint.

234
00:19:27,690 --> 00:19:32,190
So I used the one that
was in yours. You should
have thought of that.

235
00:19:32,290 --> 00:19:34,657
You took my lighter,
you asshole.

236
00:19:34,757 --> 00:19:38,190
No, remember you gave it back
because it wasn't working.

237
00:19:38,290 --> 00:19:39,923
You looking for a fight?

238
00:19:40,023 --> 00:19:42,023
I'm just telling the truth.

239
00:19:42,757 --> 00:19:45,223
[Gojyo] Damn smartass.

240
00:19:45,323 --> 00:19:46,490
[Sanzo] Idiots.
[Goky] What are you
talking about? I saw you.

241
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:47,857
[Gojyo] Did not!

242
00:19:47,957 --> 00:19:51,390
[Hakkai] You think-
[Sanzo] You shut up
and don't say it.

243
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:53,623
[Gojyo] God! What'd you
have to bring that up for?!

244
00:19:53,723 --> 00:19:54,823
Yes, Sir.

245
00:20:08,223 --> 00:20:11,157
Do you think this is wise?

246
00:20:11,257 --> 00:20:15,157
They can wait. There are
still the other Scriptures.

247
00:20:15,257 --> 00:20:16,623
Isn't that correct?

248
00:20:17,657 --> 00:20:20,490
Yes, that is true.

249
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:24,157
But Konzen's scripture
will be mine soon enough.

250
00:20:24,257 --> 00:20:27,690
As well as the boy's
infinite strength.

251
00:20:27,790 --> 00:20:29,623
[Goku] Water sprite!
[Gojyo] Monkey!

252
00:20:29,723 --> 00:20:31,190
[Goku] Roach!
[Gojyo] Chimp!

253
00:20:31,290 --> 00:20:32,423
[Goku] Carrothead!

254
00:20:33,257 --> 00:20:34,357
[Homura] Konzen,

255
00:20:34,457 --> 00:20:37,123
the next time we meet
will be your last.

256
00:20:37,223 --> 00:20:40,257
I won't let anyone
stand in my way.

257
00:20:40,357 --> 00:20:42,990
Not even you, Son Goku.

258
00:20:43,090 --> 00:20:45,923
[Sanzo] For the love of god!
[Gojyo & Goku] What?
