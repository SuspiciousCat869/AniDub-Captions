1
00:01:33,462 --> 00:01:34,662
[laughter]

2
00:01:36,262 --> 00:01:38,228
[narrator] Previously,
on Saiyuki...
[puppet] Hello. Hello.

3
00:01:38,328 --> 00:01:40,095
[narrator] A puppet approached
the Sanzo party.

4
00:01:40,195 --> 00:01:43,762
[puppet] Cho Gonou,
you are going to die.

5
00:01:43,862 --> 00:01:47,862
Why does that toy call
you by your old name?!

6
00:01:49,195 --> 00:01:52,428
[narrator] The puppet was
a shikigami sent from
Chin Yisou,

7
00:01:52,528 --> 00:01:55,795
a mysterious fortune-teller
from Hakkai's past.

8
00:01:58,028 --> 00:02:00,328
[gasp]
Hey Gojyo, look out!

9
00:02:03,162 --> 00:02:04,462
[Hakkai] Gojyo!

10
00:02:04,562 --> 00:02:05,962
[Gojyo] Ya little...

11
00:02:07,395 --> 00:02:08,328
Tru-

12
00:02:09,662 --> 00:02:12,095
[Sanzo] Come on out, Chin Yisou.

13
00:02:14,962 --> 00:02:17,262
Well my goodness.

14
00:02:17,362 --> 00:02:19,328
Don't we look dashing?

15
00:02:22,428 --> 00:02:25,528
[narrator] Chin Yisou did
not aim to kill Hakkai,

16
00:02:25,628 --> 00:02:27,928
but to destroy his spirit.

17
00:02:29,262 --> 00:02:31,462
Hey, that's really low!

18
00:02:39,795 --> 00:02:45,095
Because next time, he really is
going to lose some of his little
play buddies.

19
00:02:47,428 --> 00:02:49,195
You just try it.

20
00:02:53,395 --> 00:02:55,328
[Goku] Battle Against Darkness

21
00:03:03,595 --> 00:03:04,928
[Goku] What's going on?

22
00:03:05,028 --> 00:03:07,195
Why isn't either one
of them moving?

23
00:03:07,328 --> 00:03:09,195
[Sanzo] They're both
looking for an opening.

24
00:03:10,695 --> 00:03:13,528
[Goku] Hey, you dirty
old bastard!

25
00:03:13,628 --> 00:03:14,395
[Chin] Hmm?

26
00:03:14,495 --> 00:03:15,762
[Goku] Yeah, you!

27
00:03:16,795 --> 00:03:19,928
You just try and do
something to Sanzo!

28
00:03:20,462 --> 00:03:21,995
My compliments,

29
00:03:22,095 --> 00:03:24,562
your pet is quite
a loyal companion,

30
00:03:24,662 --> 00:03:25,828
I have to say.

31
00:03:25,928 --> 00:03:27,828
Goku, stand back!

32
00:03:27,928 --> 00:03:30,395
He howls too much for my tastes.

33
00:03:34,128 --> 00:03:40,428
Awful lot of bark for a mutt
who can barely stand up
on his own two paws.

34
00:03:41,462 --> 00:03:43,528
[Gojyo] Dude, you really
have a broken leg?

35
00:03:43,628 --> 00:03:45,028
[Goku] I told you that already!

36
00:03:45,128 --> 00:03:47,928
[Hakkai] Sanzo, let's split
up while he's not looking.

37
00:03:48,028 --> 00:03:49,595
Yes, good idea.

38
00:03:49,695 --> 00:03:52,095
Gojyo's probably hasn't
fully recovered yet and

39
00:03:52,195 --> 00:03:55,062
I'm betting Goku isn't
at his best either.

40
00:03:58,862 --> 00:03:59,795
Ready?

41
00:03:59,895 --> 00:04:00,828
Go!

42
00:04:01,328 --> 00:04:02,428
Cowards!

43
00:04:02,528 --> 00:04:05,462
Attacking me while
my back is turned!

44
00:04:05,562 --> 00:04:07,828
All right, so it's my turn now!

45
00:04:10,628 --> 00:04:11,828
We're going after him!

46
00:04:11,928 --> 00:04:13,795
Gojyo, you stay here with Goku.

47
00:04:13,928 --> 00:04:15,062
[Gojyo] Wait a minute!

48
00:04:16,295 --> 00:04:18,295
I can't believe those
bastards ditched us!

49
00:04:18,395 --> 00:04:20,095
[Goku] Are we going
to take that from them?

50
00:04:20,195 --> 00:04:22,495
[Gojyo] It won't be easy
to defeat that guy on their own.

51
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:23,528
Let's go after them!

52
00:04:23,628 --> 00:04:25,295
[Goku] I'm right behind you!

53
00:04:26,695 --> 00:04:29,895
I take it your wound's
not completely healed yet?

54
00:04:30,795 --> 00:04:32,128
Useless bastard.

55
00:04:32,228 --> 00:04:35,362
Oh, you're sure one to talk,
you stupid one-legged monkey!

56
00:04:35,462 --> 00:04:38,195
Quit calling me a monkey,
water sprite!

57
00:04:42,762 --> 00:04:44,928
We haven't lost sight
of him, have we?

58
00:04:45,028 --> 00:04:47,428
No, I'm sensing something else.

59
00:04:48,928 --> 00:04:51,195
[Hakkai] Chin Yisou,
if you want to kill me,

60
00:04:51,295 --> 00:04:53,395
you'll have to show
yourself eventually!

61
00:04:56,962 --> 00:04:59,062
[Sanzo] He's sure to be around
here somewhere.

62
00:05:00,295 --> 00:05:02,728
At the moment, he's planning
to have you watch me die

63
00:05:02,828 --> 00:05:04,528
right in front of your eyes.

64
00:05:05,295 --> 00:05:06,462
[Hakkai] No.

65
00:05:09,095 --> 00:05:10,928
That's not what he's after.

66
00:05:11,028 --> 00:05:13,962
He wants to destroy
my soul, Sanzo.

67
00:05:14,062 --> 00:05:16,495
[Chin] I'm so happy for you.

68
00:05:19,395 --> 00:05:23,195
Her suffering has finally
come to an end.

69
00:05:25,828 --> 00:05:29,362
My goodness,
what a terrifying look.

70
00:05:31,128 --> 00:05:32,728
You must...

71
00:05:32,828 --> 00:05:37,028
[choking]

72
00:05:37,128 --> 00:05:41,962
be desiring to murder me
with all your heart and soul.

73
00:05:44,728 --> 00:05:51,195
[Chin] How proud you must be
to have slayed ever demon in
this castle all by yourself.

74
00:05:51,295 --> 00:05:55,428
No human could have accomplished
a feat like that all alone.

75
00:05:56,262 --> 00:05:57,628
[Chin] Then again...

76
00:05:57,728 --> 00:06:00,562
it is only a legend, but it says

77
00:06:00,662 --> 00:06:03,962
a human who has bathed in the
blood of a thousand demons

78
00:06:04,062 --> 00:06:06,528
shall become a demon himself.

79
00:06:07,062 --> 00:06:09,328
Isn't that ironic?

80
00:06:10,195 --> 00:06:12,195
[Hakkai] B-Bastard!

81
00:06:13,562 --> 00:06:16,695
I was sure I had killed
him that night.

82
00:06:16,795 --> 00:06:19,762
But there's no mistaking
those eyes.

83
00:06:22,328 --> 00:06:23,562
[clink]

84
00:06:31,328 --> 00:06:32,728
Sanzo...

85
00:06:33,762 --> 00:06:34,862
[Sanzo] What is it?

86
00:06:34,962 --> 00:06:36,895
Ask me something stupid,
and I'll kill you.

87
00:06:36,995 --> 00:06:39,262
[Hakkai] Okay,
maybe I shouldn't, then.

88
00:06:39,362 --> 00:06:41,328
[Sanzo] Are you trying
to annoy me?

89
00:06:44,062 --> 00:06:45,862
Do you think...

90
00:06:45,962 --> 00:06:48,828
it's really okay
for me to be here?

91
00:06:52,728 --> 00:06:54,862
[Sanzo] See? That was stupid.

92
00:06:54,962 --> 00:06:56,262
Now I have to kill you.

93
00:06:56,362 --> 00:06:57,628
[Hakkai] Is it really?

94
00:07:03,295 --> 00:07:05,595
[Sanzo] I know you
would never betray me.

95
00:07:10,862 --> 00:07:12,495
Am I right?

96
00:07:14,362 --> 00:07:17,462
That's not a fair
question, it is?

97
00:07:19,195 --> 00:07:22,128
[Hakkai] I've never really been
in a position to find out.

98
00:07:23,362 --> 00:07:25,962
[Goku] Arg, that branch
just hit me in the face!

99
00:07:26,062 --> 00:07:27,495
[Gojyo] Will you stop
struggling?

100
00:07:27,595 --> 00:07:30,062
You can't even
stand by yourself!

101
00:07:30,162 --> 00:07:31,595
[Goku] Can't you go any faster?

102
00:07:31,695 --> 00:07:33,128
[Gojyo] Stop your whining!

103
00:07:33,228 --> 00:07:35,228
I need to concentrate
on where I'm going.

104
00:07:35,328 --> 00:07:37,328
[Goku] In circles,
it looks like.

105
00:07:37,428 --> 00:07:40,662
Do we even know that Hakkai
and Sanzo went this way?

106
00:07:42,262 --> 00:07:44,695
It's Hakkai's mental state
I'm worried about.

107
00:07:46,862 --> 00:07:50,428
Oh, I'm sure
he'll be all right, man.

108
00:07:50,528 --> 00:07:53,728
[Goku] He told me that as long
as there are people out there
who believe in him,

109
00:07:53,828 --> 00:07:55,662
he'll find a way to survive.

110
00:07:55,762 --> 00:07:59,062
He'll do anything within his
power not to let them down.

111
00:07:59,162 --> 00:08:03,162
[Gojyo] Yeah, but he said that
before he had a crazy fortune
teller trying to kill him.

112
00:08:03,928 --> 00:08:05,762
I'm sure he'll be all right.

113
00:08:09,795 --> 00:08:12,062
[Gojyo] Hold on,
I'm speeding up, money-boy!

114
00:08:12,162 --> 00:08:14,862
[Goku] Stop calling
me that, water sprite!

115
00:08:26,628 --> 00:08:28,362
He's on the move now.

116
00:08:36,962 --> 00:08:37,828
Up there!

117
00:08:37,928 --> 00:08:41,428
[Chin] Heh, heh, heh. How sweet.

118
00:08:41,562 --> 00:08:44,528
A little heart-to-heart
before the big farewell.

119
00:08:44,628 --> 00:08:47,728
I'm through with playing this
game of hide-and-seek with you.

120
00:08:47,828 --> 00:08:49,195
Come down here!

121
00:08:49,295 --> 00:08:50,762
Is that so, monk?

122
00:08:50,862 --> 00:08:55,295
Then I'll take as little
of your time as possible.

123
00:08:55,395 --> 00:08:57,728
This will all be over quickly.

124
00:08:58,795 --> 00:08:59,928
[Chin] Cho Gonou,

125
00:09:00,028 --> 00:09:04,028
you killed my entire clan
for the sake of one woman.

126
00:09:04,128 --> 00:09:05,895
I hope she was worth it.

127
00:09:05,995 --> 00:09:09,395
For one single woman who
was my entire other life.

128
00:09:09,495 --> 00:09:12,295
[Chin] Not only did you
kill my entire clan,

129
00:09:12,395 --> 00:09:16,028
but you had the audacity
to kill my father.

130
00:09:16,128 --> 00:09:18,862
He died by your hands, no?

131
00:09:18,962 --> 00:09:20,362
You're breaking my heart.

132
00:09:20,462 --> 00:09:25,295
[Chin] Oh, what a forgiving
friend you have there,
Cho Gonou.

133
00:09:25,395 --> 00:09:28,128
I can't tell you how
happy it makes me to see

134
00:09:28,228 --> 00:09:30,095
that you have found
another companion

135
00:09:30,195 --> 00:09:32,795
who you would just
hate to see die.

136
00:09:32,895 --> 00:09:37,528
I'm the one you're after,
so go ahead and try to do
whatever you can to me,

137
00:09:37,628 --> 00:09:38,695
but him...

138
00:09:40,262 --> 00:09:44,695
I will personally see to
it that you never lay
a finger on him!

139
00:09:45,262 --> 00:09:47,095
Heh, heh, heh.

140
00:09:47,228 --> 00:09:50,395
I can't lay a finger
on the monk, you say?

141
00:09:50,495 --> 00:09:52,395
[laughter]

142
00:09:52,495 --> 00:09:56,495
[Chin] But how will I kill him?
Oh, what to do? What to do?

143
00:09:56,595 --> 00:09:59,095
Quite a predicament.

144
00:09:59,195 --> 00:10:00,628
Tell you what...

145
00:10:03,962 --> 00:10:08,495
[Chin] Hakkai, you do take
care of the monk for me.

146
00:10:09,695 --> 00:10:11,995
I want to see your face...

147
00:10:13,428 --> 00:10:19,028
[Chin] Show me the agony
you suffer at witnessing
your own crime!

148
00:10:19,128 --> 00:10:21,728
[Hakkai] No, this can't be...

149
00:10:22,495 --> 00:10:25,328
[screaming]

150
00:10:25,428 --> 00:10:26,728
What is it?

151
00:10:27,762 --> 00:10:29,428
[Hakkai] Stay back.

152
00:10:29,528 --> 00:10:31,662
Please, don't come near me.

153
00:10:34,662 --> 00:10:36,495
[Sanzo] Hakkai! Hakkai-

154
00:10:40,928 --> 00:10:42,228
Hakkai...

155
00:10:44,428 --> 00:10:46,695
[Hakkai] I can't control my arm.

156
00:10:46,795 --> 00:10:48,962
[Chin] What a frail
creature you are.

157
00:10:49,062 --> 00:10:53,562
How easily I was able to work
my way into the crevices
of your heart.

158
00:10:53,662 --> 00:10:56,762
Now, hurry up and put him
out of his misery.

159
00:10:56,862 --> 00:10:58,228
[Hakkai] Never!

160
00:10:59,095 --> 00:11:00,662
Why on Earth not?

161
00:11:00,762 --> 00:11:04,428
Can't you see that the poor
boy is suffering because of you?

162
00:11:04,528 --> 00:11:07,662
[Chin] It should be easy. Think
of all the practice you've had.

163
00:11:07,762 --> 00:11:13,128
Just let go and do as you've
done so many times before!

164
00:11:14,262 --> 00:11:17,228
What's one more death
considering all the others

165
00:11:17,328 --> 00:11:20,762
who have died at your hands?

166
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:31,267
[screaming]

167
00:11:31,629 --> 00:11:32,668
Hakkai!

168
00:11:32,668 --> 00:11:34,401
What the hell's going on?!

169
00:11:37,201 --> 00:11:39,468
[Gojyo] Hey,
don't over exert yourself-

170
00:11:39,568 --> 00:11:41,068
Hey, I'll pull my weight!

171
00:11:42,435 --> 00:11:43,768
That'll be a change.

172
00:11:43,868 --> 00:11:45,668
[Chin] Ah, the memories.

173
00:11:45,768 --> 00:11:49,801
I can't tell you how nice it is
for us to reminisce like this.

174
00:11:49,901 --> 00:11:52,368
Surely you remember the night...

175
00:11:53,735 --> 00:11:55,468
I died?

176
00:11:58,935 --> 00:12:00,201
So...

177
00:12:01,335 --> 00:12:04,435
Now you truly have...

178
00:12:07,201 --> 00:12:11,201
become a demon like us.

179
00:12:14,401 --> 00:12:17,168
[screaming]

180
00:12:19,568 --> 00:12:21,235
[Hakkai] How can you be alive?

181
00:12:21,335 --> 00:12:24,435
I killed him! I know I did!

182
00:12:24,535 --> 00:12:27,501
Yes, you did a fine job
of slicing into me.

183
00:12:27,601 --> 00:12:30,068
You must have had quite
a bit of practice,

184
00:12:30,168 --> 00:12:36,035
being the man who became one
of us by bathing in the blood
of a thousand demons you slayed.

185
00:12:38,801 --> 00:12:44,635
But that night, as I breathed
my last, I took this life piece,

186
00:12:44,735 --> 00:12:48,468
and buried it deep inside
my dying body

187
00:12:48,568 --> 00:12:52,568
through the opening you
carved into my gut.

188
00:12:53,068 --> 00:12:54,368
[Hakkai] My gut?

189
00:12:54,468 --> 00:12:58,201
This psycho turned his own
corpse into a shikigami!

190
00:12:58,301 --> 00:13:03,701
[Chin] Do you know what posessed
me to do such a terrible thing
to myself?

191
00:13:06,068 --> 00:13:10,668
I did it so that one day,
I could make you suffer.

192
00:13:12,268 --> 00:13:16,068
So that one day,
you could feel the pain I felt.

193
00:13:16,168 --> 00:13:17,501
It can't be...

194
00:13:17,601 --> 00:13:20,335
[Chin] Lose a little bit
of what I lost...

195
00:13:20,435 --> 00:13:21,868
[Hakkai] No!

196
00:13:21,968 --> 00:13:26,035
[Chin] ...until I take away
everything you cared for.

197
00:13:26,668 --> 00:13:31,235
[screaming]

198
00:13:37,968 --> 00:13:39,168
[Hakkai] Sanzo...

199
00:13:44,168 --> 00:13:45,335
Sanzo!

200
00:13:46,401 --> 00:13:48,535
Sanzo! Sanzo!

201
00:13:49,135 --> 00:13:50,301
Sanzo!

202
00:13:55,868 --> 00:13:59,068
[screaming]

203
00:14:03,235 --> 00:14:05,135
See how easy that was?

204
00:14:05,235 --> 00:14:08,368
And I didn't even have
to lift a finger.

205
00:14:09,268 --> 00:14:10,368
[Goku] Sanzo!

206
00:14:10,468 --> 00:14:12,535
[Chin] Look, your friends
have arrived.

207
00:14:12,635 --> 00:14:16,868
I guess you'll have a hard
time explaining what you did.

208
00:14:16,968 --> 00:14:20,068
Not much longer, now.

209
00:14:20,168 --> 00:14:23,601
[Chin] Soon, you will
have nothing left.

210
00:14:29,601 --> 00:14:31,068
[Goku] What's happened here?

211
00:14:31,435 --> 00:14:33,001
Sanzo?

212
00:14:33,101 --> 00:14:34,268
[Gojyo] Is he all right?

213
00:14:35,168 --> 00:14:36,801
We aren't too late, are we?

214
00:14:36,901 --> 00:14:38,635
What did that bastard do?

215
00:14:38,735 --> 00:14:39,868
[Hakkai] I did it.

216
00:14:40,335 --> 00:14:41,768
[Goku] What?!

217
00:14:41,868 --> 00:14:42,968
[Gojyo] Come again?

218
00:14:45,101 --> 00:14:46,435
[Hakkai] I did it!

219
00:14:48,068 --> 00:14:49,068
Look out!

220
00:14:50,235 --> 00:14:52,135
What're you doing, Hakkai?!

221
00:14:54,068 --> 00:14:55,635
It's really no use.

222
00:14:55,735 --> 00:14:58,801
He might as well be
my own personal puppet.

223
00:14:58,901 --> 00:15:00,935
Stop it! Hakkai!

224
00:15:03,568 --> 00:15:05,101
Get out of the way, Goku!

225
00:15:09,535 --> 00:15:10,568
[Chin] Hrg!

226
00:15:11,501 --> 00:15:12,735
No!

227
00:15:21,401 --> 00:15:24,968
It was all part
of some stupid act?

228
00:15:26,835 --> 00:15:29,401
Don't play us for fools, moron.

229
00:15:31,268 --> 00:15:34,535
Wait a sec... you were just
faking the whole time?

230
00:15:34,635 --> 00:15:36,968
I should've known after
that performance.

231
00:15:37,068 --> 00:15:38,735
Don't quit your day job.

232
00:15:38,835 --> 00:15:40,235
[Sanzo] Bite me.

233
00:15:40,335 --> 00:15:42,035
[Hakkai] Didn't mean
to scare you.

234
00:15:42,135 --> 00:15:45,535
I have to admit, I actually
kind of enjoyed the show.

235
00:15:45,635 --> 00:15:50,335
[Chin] I have to agree,
quite a spectacle.

236
00:15:50,435 --> 00:15:53,601
Hakkai would probably rather
bite off his own tongue

237
00:15:53,701 --> 00:15:56,235
than strangle me to death.

238
00:15:56,335 --> 00:15:59,901
You said it was easy to find
the crevices in my heart?

239
00:16:00,001 --> 00:16:02,335
[Hakkai] Well, my heart isn't
big enough for crevices.

240
00:16:04,468 --> 00:16:07,135
You would think you would've
learned after the last time
I killed you,

241
00:16:07,235 --> 00:16:10,701
not to underestimate me,
fortune teller.

242
00:16:10,801 --> 00:16:14,068
The only difference between
you and the rest of your clan...

243
00:16:17,901 --> 00:16:20,101
is that I get to kill you twice.

244
00:16:21,268 --> 00:16:24,501
[laughter]

245
00:16:24,601 --> 00:16:26,001
[Gojyo] What's so damn funny?!

246
00:16:26,101 --> 00:16:27,968
[Chin] I don't mind dying,

247
00:16:28,068 --> 00:16:32,001
but do you actually think
you can defeat me with
Qigong techniques?

248
00:16:33,668 --> 00:16:35,101
Do you?

249
00:16:36,735 --> 00:16:38,368
[Chin] Or perhaps...

250
00:16:38,468 --> 00:16:42,435
you are brave enough
to fight without your
demon power limiters,

251
00:16:42,535 --> 00:16:43,901
as you did then?!

252
00:16:44,001 --> 00:16:46,201
I see no need for
something so rash.

253
00:16:46,301 --> 00:16:47,135
Oh?!

254
00:16:50,168 --> 00:16:52,935
[Chin] Have you lost your mind?!

255
00:16:57,368 --> 00:17:00,001
[Hakkai] It was right
about here, wasn't it?

256
00:17:00,101 --> 00:17:02,801
Where I stabbed you
all those years ago.

257
00:17:07,235 --> 00:17:11,401
Your Qigong is not powerful
enough to hurt me...

258
00:17:11,501 --> 00:17:14,401
[Hakkai] Oh, I don't know.
You'd be surprised.

259
00:17:14,501 --> 00:17:17,701
Qigong can actually
be quite versitle.

260
00:17:30,468 --> 00:17:33,735
[Chin] I'm so
disappointed in you.

261
00:17:33,835 --> 00:17:39,868
I expected you to provide much
more entertainment than you did.

262
00:17:39,968 --> 00:17:41,735
[Hakkai] Thank you very much.

263
00:17:41,835 --> 00:17:45,301
Guess I didn't do a very good
job of following your script.

264
00:17:45,401 --> 00:17:48,435
[Chin] Cho Gonou...

265
00:17:48,535 --> 00:17:49,501
[Hakkai] No...

266
00:17:51,301 --> 00:17:53,368
[groan]

267
00:17:53,468 --> 00:17:56,701
My name is Cho Hakkai.

268
00:17:58,101 --> 00:18:03,035
How every ounce
of my being despises you.

269
00:18:04,701 --> 00:18:08,735
[Chin] Even in the end,
I hate you.

270
00:18:08,835 --> 00:18:13,401
What a coincidence. I feel
the exact same way about you.

271
00:18:20,201 --> 00:18:22,801
[Hakkai] At least I'm not
a creature like you,

272
00:18:22,901 --> 00:18:25,101
without a past or a future.

273
00:18:34,235 --> 00:18:36,135
[Goku] You pervery
water sprite!

274
00:18:36,235 --> 00:18:37,501
What do you think you're doing?!

275
00:18:37,601 --> 00:18:38,468
Cut it out!

276
00:18:38,568 --> 00:18:41,268
[Gojyo] Ooh, I like it.

277
00:18:41,368 --> 00:18:43,201
[Goku] I can't walk around
with all this graffiti!

278
00:18:43,301 --> 00:18:44,301
It's insulting!

279
00:18:44,401 --> 00:18:45,501
[Sanzo] Will you shut up?!

280
00:18:45,635 --> 00:18:48,368
Can you at least just be quiet
while we set you leg?!

281
00:18:49,135 --> 00:18:52,035
[Goku] Now my head bone's broke!

282
00:18:52,135 --> 00:18:53,501
Try breaking his jaw bone, huh?

283
00:18:53,601 --> 00:18:55,968
I'm already one step
ahead of you, my man.

284
00:18:56,068 --> 00:18:58,268
[Goku] Don't even joke about it!

285
00:18:58,368 --> 00:18:59,735
[Gojyo] Heh, heh, heh.

286
00:19:04,383 --> 00:19:05,743
You know, I enjoyed that.

287
00:19:05,743 --> 00:19:07,443
You're awfully energetic.

288
00:19:07,543 --> 00:19:10,409
Shouldn't you be recovering
from your injuries?

289
00:19:10,509 --> 00:19:12,109
You're sure one to talk.

290
00:19:12,209 --> 00:19:14,743
You look as though a weight's
been lifted off your shoulders.

291
00:19:14,843 --> 00:19:16,043
I suppose.

292
00:19:16,143 --> 00:19:17,376
You know, in a funny way,

293
00:19:17,476 --> 00:19:19,809
that fortune teller did
me a huge favor.

294
00:19:24,676 --> 00:19:27,609
[Hakkai] I've been carrying my
past around with me so long.

295
00:19:29,043 --> 00:19:31,009
I suppose it was only
a matter of time...

296
00:19:31,109 --> 00:19:33,943
before I had to confront
that part of myself again.

297
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:41,643
Right now, I'm wishing my
lifeline was just a teensy
bit longer

298
00:19:41,743 --> 00:19:43,043
than it is at the moment.

299
00:19:43,143 --> 00:19:44,209
Yeah?

300
00:19:45,276 --> 00:19:46,909
Guess that means that

301
00:19:47,009 --> 00:19:49,776
I just have to get used
to the idea

302
00:19:49,876 --> 00:19:53,309
that I'm going to have to make
the most of the short time
that I have left.

303
00:19:53,409 --> 00:19:55,609
[Goku] No.
I've got a better idea!

304
00:19:55,709 --> 00:19:56,876
Try this!

305
00:19:58,276 --> 00:19:59,176
Yeah?

306
00:20:01,809 --> 00:20:04,843
Dumbass. Can't you at least
pick up after yourself?

307
00:20:04,943 --> 00:20:06,309
[Goku] That hurt!

308
00:20:06,409 --> 00:20:08,576
[Gojyo] Heh, heh, heh.
Do it again.

309
00:20:09,609 --> 00:20:12,376
[Hakkai] Kanan, I'd like
to live for myself

310
00:20:12,476 --> 00:20:14,209
just a little while longer.

311
00:20:16,676 --> 00:20:18,209
[Hakkai] Ah...

312
00:20:18,309 --> 00:20:19,109
[Gojyo] Huh?

313
00:20:19,209 --> 00:20:21,076
[Hakkai] This is permanent ink.

314
00:20:21,176 --> 00:20:23,543
[Gojyo] Yup, permanent ink.

315
00:20:23,643 --> 00:20:26,276
[Hakkai] Will you look at that?
It's not going to come off.

316
00:20:29,376 --> 00:20:31,309
Nope, not coming off.

317
00:20:35,576 --> 00:20:37,709
I guess that's all right.

318
00:20:37,809 --> 00:20:39,943
[Sanzo] Everybody,
let's move out!

319
00:20:40,043 --> 00:20:41,276
[Gojyo] Right with you!

320
00:20:41,376 --> 00:20:44,143
[Goku] Maybe if we had steak,
my bones would heal quicker?

321
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:45,909
[Sanzo] Like hell they would!

322
00:22:27,176 --> 00:22:29,976
[Goku] You've heard the
saying that you shouldn't
trust anybody,

323
00:22:30,076 --> 00:22:33,843
but does that mean we should
even be suspicious of the people
we're close to?

324
00:22:33,943 --> 00:22:35,143
I can't do that!

325
00:22:35,243 --> 00:22:37,409
Even if others
do think I'm stupid,

326
00:22:37,509 --> 00:22:39,243
you've got to have
faith in people!

327
00:22:39,343 --> 00:22:41,909
Otherwise, how can you
have faith in yourself?

328
00:22:42,043 --> 00:22:43,176
Or the future?

329
00:22:43,276 --> 00:22:46,376
Trust is put to the test
in "The Forbidden Fruit",

330
00:22:46,476 --> 00:22:48,376
next time on "Saiyuki".
