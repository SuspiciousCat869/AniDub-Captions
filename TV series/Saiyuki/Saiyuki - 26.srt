1
00:01:35,155 --> 00:01:37,254
[Hakkai] It's been three
months since we left Chang'an,

2
00:01:37,254 --> 00:01:40,062
yet we still have
a long way to go.

3
00:01:40,062 --> 00:01:44,162
And you're forgetting we still
know very little about the
experiments to revive Gyumaoh.

4
00:01:44,262 --> 00:01:47,629
We have no time to
waste on fool's errands.

5
00:01:47,729 --> 00:01:52,129
And yet I don't feel any part
of this journey has been
wasted, you know what I mean?

6
00:01:52,229 --> 00:01:53,795
I guess...

7
00:01:53,895 --> 00:01:57,729
[Gojyo] Hey, guys.
Check this out.

8
00:01:57,829 --> 00:01:59,729
Isn't it somethin'?

9
00:01:59,829 --> 00:02:02,329
[Goku] It's more
beautiful than a meat bun!

10
00:02:02,429 --> 00:02:04,762
[Gojyo] That's quite
an endorsement.

11
00:02:04,862 --> 00:02:10,062
[Hakkai] Come to think of it,
we're always heading towards
the setting sun, aren't we?

12
00:02:10,162 --> 00:02:11,695
Ah, sweet youth!

13
00:02:11,795 --> 00:02:14,062
[Gojyo begins laughing
hysterically]

14
00:02:14,162 --> 00:02:16,829
[Gojyo] Ah, sweet youth!

15
00:02:16,929 --> 00:02:18,795
It wasn't that bad, now was it?

16
00:02:20,695 --> 00:02:23,029
<i>[Sanz] No time has</i>
<i>been wasted, huh?</i>

17
00:02:24,929 --> 00:02:25,929
[Sanzo] Everyone, let's go!

18
00:02:26,029 --> 00:02:27,395
[Hakkai] Yes, let's.
[Gojyo] In we go!

19
00:02:27,495 --> 00:02:28,629
[Goku] Yippee!

20
00:02:31,162 --> 00:02:34,129
We can see sunsets everyday.

21
00:02:34,262 --> 00:02:37,062
[Goddess] For as
long as you live.

22
00:02:37,162 --> 00:02:39,695
But I wonder, are
you still alive?

23
00:02:39,795 --> 00:02:41,429
Your blood flows, you breathe,

24
00:02:41,529 --> 00:02:44,462
but without emotion, you are
nothing but an empty shell.

25
00:02:44,562 --> 00:02:47,495
As soulless as a
cold, dead corpse.

26
00:02:48,695 --> 00:02:51,895
How long can you live
like this, Nataku?

27
00:02:51,995 --> 00:02:54,762
The memories of that brat's
crimes were sealed away

28
00:02:54,862 --> 00:02:58,862
in the vaults of Heavens
more than 500 years ago.

29
00:02:58,962 --> 00:03:02,995
He can't remember
Tenpou or Kenren.

30
00:03:03,095 --> 00:03:05,962
Or Konzen. Nor even you or me.

31
00:03:08,062 --> 00:03:12,429
Well, you asked for this
cruel fate, but I wonder
just how long you can wait.

32
00:03:13,995 --> 00:03:16,462
Now that you have turned
into this blank slate.

33
00:03:16,562 --> 00:03:19,062
Your soul lives alone.

34
00:03:19,162 --> 00:03:22,962
All alone and condemned to
live enternally in the past.

35
00:03:26,395 --> 00:03:28,295
[Goku] "Silent Cry".

36
00:03:36,095 --> 00:03:37,995
I'm so bored!

37
00:03:38,095 --> 00:03:42,495
Come to think of it,
we haven't run into a
demon for some time now.

38
00:03:42,595 --> 00:03:45,829
Yeah, and I'm totally
out of shape!

39
00:03:45,929 --> 00:03:48,562
How about I give
you a refresher course,

40
00:03:48,662 --> 00:03:50,429
[Gojyo] how's that, huh?!
[Goku] Shut up!

41
00:03:50,529 --> 00:03:53,429
How inane can an
argument possibly get?

42
00:03:53,529 --> 00:03:54,629
Lighten up. They're just
keeping themselves occupied.

43
00:03:58,129 --> 00:03:59,062
What the-?!

44
00:03:59,162 --> 00:04:00,729
Aw man, did we
run over somebody?

45
00:04:00,829 --> 00:04:04,962
You said you were
looking for some action,
I think we found it.

46
00:04:09,295 --> 00:04:11,829
The notorious Sanzo
company, I presume?

47
00:04:11,929 --> 00:04:13,495
So what if we are?

48
00:04:13,595 --> 00:04:17,195
Then standing before you
is the Armored Demon Corps,

49
00:04:17,295 --> 00:04:18,762
under the Kougaiji's command.

50
00:04:18,862 --> 00:04:20,795
Why should I care?

51
00:04:20,895 --> 00:04:25,562
Because my Lord has ordered
me to let you state my steel!

52
00:04:25,662 --> 00:04:27,329
Ready men?!

53
00:04:27,429 --> 00:04:28,562
Attack!

54
00:04:29,562 --> 00:04:31,062
[Goku] Bring it on!

55
00:04:32,562 --> 00:04:34,195
[Kougaiji] What's
the meaning of this?!

56
00:04:34,295 --> 00:04:36,162
How dare you send an
Armored Demon Corps

57
00:04:36,262 --> 00:04:39,295
after the Sanzo party
without even consulting me?!

58
00:04:39,395 --> 00:04:41,929
[Koshu] I didn't expect to
see you after that pathetic

59
00:04:42,029 --> 00:04:43,895
performance in your
last encounter.

60
00:04:43,995 --> 00:04:46,795
I'm surprised you can
even show your face.

61
00:04:47,862 --> 00:04:50,862
I do hope your wounds
are healing nicely.

62
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:54,995
[Kougaiji] But they'll be
slaughtered, and for what?

63
00:04:55,095 --> 00:04:59,529
[Koshu] Why not? What did those
fools have to live for anyway?

64
00:04:59,629 --> 00:05:02,629
I did them a favor,
if you ask me.

65
00:05:02,729 --> 00:05:04,629
And besides, take a look.

66
00:05:04,729 --> 00:05:08,762
Our efforts to revive Gyumaoh
have entered a new phase.

67
00:05:08,862 --> 00:05:13,895
<i>[Kougaiji] Come to think</i>
<i>of it, this equipment</i>
<i>wasn't here than before.</i>

68
00:05:13,995 --> 00:05:15,262
<i>Amazing...</i>

69
00:05:15,362 --> 00:05:18,195
<i>How I never get use</i>
<i>to the sight of him.</i>

70
00:05:19,829 --> 00:05:22,262
[Koshu] I think your talents
might be put to better use if

71
00:05:22,362 --> 00:05:27,562
you focused your energies
on searching for the
scriptures, don't you?

72
00:05:27,662 --> 00:05:33,262
So, in other words, I don't want
you wasting any more time on
the Sanzo party. Are we clear?

73
00:05:33,362 --> 00:05:38,495
[Kougaiji] That's absurd!
[Koshu] Don't make me remind
you that Gyumaoh can only be

74
00:05:38,595 --> 00:05:41,729
awakened if we obtain the five
Scriptures of Heaven and Earth

75
00:05:41,829 --> 00:05:44,795
the gods used for the
creation of the world.

76
00:05:46,762 --> 00:05:50,395
I want you to find
them, Kougaiji.

77
00:05:50,495 --> 00:05:54,829
The Seiten Scripture of Koumyou
Sanzo that governs evolution.

78
00:05:54,962 --> 00:06:00,662
The Maten Scripture of
Genjo Sanzo that consigns
all power to oblivion.

79
00:06:00,762 --> 00:06:04,462
And the other three
scattered about the globe.

80
00:06:04,562 --> 00:06:07,129
Find them all, and
bring them to me.

81
00:06:08,495 --> 00:06:12,295
Oh? What's wrong? I thought
you would be pleased.

82
00:06:12,395 --> 00:06:14,595
[Kougaiji] Pleased?!
[Koshu] Yes.

83
00:06:14,695 --> 00:06:17,695
[Koshu] It means you'll
be able to free your
mother that much sooner.

84
00:06:17,795 --> 00:06:21,429
Depending, of course, on how
quickly you complete your task.

85
00:06:21,529 --> 00:06:23,129
That had better be the truth.

86
00:06:23,229 --> 00:06:26,429
Who knows? You can register
any complaints you might

87
00:06:26,529 --> 00:06:28,462
have when the mission's
finally completed.

88
00:06:30,029 --> 00:06:32,295
Hurry on now. And by the way.

89
00:06:34,129 --> 00:06:37,462
Do keep Lirin from venturing
outside the castle too much.

90
00:06:37,562 --> 00:06:41,129
She is our one and
only daughter after
all, isn't that right?

91
00:06:41,229 --> 00:06:47,429
I mean, we can't be too
careful. That makes her
very precious indeed.

92
00:06:49,162 --> 00:06:51,429
We're no longer allowed
to pursue Sanzo?

93
00:06:51,529 --> 00:06:55,195
This can't be for real.

94
00:06:55,295 --> 00:07:00,395
She has ordered us to locate
the other Sanzos and get hold
of their scriptures first.

95
00:07:00,495 --> 00:07:05,162
From now on, all our efforts are
supposed to be focused there.

96
00:07:05,262 --> 00:07:07,595
If this turns out to be
the quickest way to end

97
00:07:07,695 --> 00:07:11,462
this idiotic experiment,
then so be it.

98
00:07:11,562 --> 00:07:16,762
[Dokugakuji] And what? Are
we going to just jump and do
exactly what the she-fox says?

99
00:07:16,862 --> 00:07:21,062
Don't get me wrong. I'm not so
keen on following orders either.

100
00:07:21,162 --> 00:07:23,929
But if we don't do this,
even more people will die.

101
00:07:24,029 --> 00:07:25,095
You're right.

102
00:07:25,195 --> 00:07:26,595
[Kougaiji] Yaone.

103
00:07:26,695 --> 00:07:29,029
I want you to stay
here with Lirin.

104
00:07:29,129 --> 00:07:30,929
What for?

105
00:07:31,029 --> 00:07:32,962
[Kougaiji] I've got
a bad feeling.

106
00:07:33,062 --> 00:07:36,729
I don't want you to leave
her side, understand?

107
00:07:36,829 --> 00:07:37,695
[Yaone] Yes, My Lord.

108
00:07:37,795 --> 00:07:39,429
[Dokugakuji] Wait, are you...

109
00:07:39,529 --> 00:07:42,562
Are we really giving up
on going after Sanzo?

110
00:07:42,662 --> 00:07:44,095
[Kougaiji] Only in appearance.

111
00:07:44,195 --> 00:07:47,995
Don't worry. They won't
be so easy to kill.

112
00:07:48,095 --> 00:07:51,462
I will not allow anyone else
to have my revenge for me.

113
00:07:51,562 --> 00:07:53,829
I still have a lot of payback.

114
00:07:55,562 --> 00:07:58,562
And I want to be the
one to give it to them.

115
00:07:58,662 --> 00:08:00,029
It's not over.

116
00:08:00,895 --> 00:08:02,529
This one's mine!

117
00:08:06,829 --> 00:08:08,529
Aw man, this is too easy!

118
00:08:10,762 --> 00:08:12,562
Don't be so selfish, Goku!

119
00:08:12,662 --> 00:08:14,929
Be sure to save some
for me now, will ya?

120
00:08:15,629 --> 00:08:16,762
My turn!

121
00:08:22,095 --> 00:08:23,829
You better watch
your ass, Goku.

122
00:08:23,929 --> 00:08:26,829
A few more moves like that and
I just might catch up with you.

123
00:08:26,929 --> 00:08:29,295
I sure like your style, Hakkai.

124
00:08:35,262 --> 00:08:39,195
<i>[Gojyo] Hm. Sanzo's gun seems</i>
<i>to disintegrate their armor.</i>

125
00:08:46,529 --> 00:08:47,729
Got 'em all!

126
00:08:50,429 --> 00:08:54,062
<i>[Rashu] They're even more</i>
<i>powerful than the legends say!</i>

127
00:08:54,162 --> 00:08:56,729
[Hakkai] Hey big guy!
So what's it going to be?

128
00:08:56,829 --> 00:08:59,362
I think you ought to call
it a day, don't you?

129
00:08:59,462 --> 00:09:00,962
I've no need...

130
00:09:01,562 --> 00:09:03,195
...of mercy!

131
00:09:05,329 --> 00:09:07,095
Sanzo!

132
00:09:10,929 --> 00:09:13,062
You okay, Sanzo?!

133
00:09:13,162 --> 00:09:15,329
Well, that was overkill.

134
00:09:18,829 --> 00:09:21,062
Boy, we sure did leave a mess.

135
00:09:21,162 --> 00:09:24,162
[Gojyo] And trash pickup
isn't until Thursday.

136
00:09:24,262 --> 00:09:25,329
[Sanzo] Leave it.

137
00:09:25,429 --> 00:09:27,062
I'm sure some idiot
will pick it up.

138
00:09:28,329 --> 00:09:30,462
Awesome! What a cool helmet!

139
00:09:30,562 --> 00:09:33,695
I bet we could trade
it for some meat buns.

140
00:09:33,795 --> 00:09:35,229
[Sanzo] Put that down!

141
00:09:35,329 --> 00:09:36,862
Okay, so how do I look?

142
00:09:38,495 --> 00:09:39,862
Loser.

143
00:09:39,962 --> 00:09:42,095
[Rashu begins
laughing maniacally]

144
00:09:48,029 --> 00:09:49,429
Get it off me!

145
00:09:50,029 --> 00:09:51,229
What did he do now?!

146
00:09:51,329 --> 00:09:52,429
Oh no!

147
00:09:52,529 --> 00:09:53,562
That little idiot!

148
00:09:53,662 --> 00:09:55,295
Help Sanzo!

149
00:09:55,395 --> 00:09:56,995
Goku!

150
00:09:59,829 --> 00:10:02,429
[Rashu] I have you now, Sanzo!

151
00:10:02,529 --> 00:10:04,629
What the-?!

152
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:06,729
What-what's happening?!

153
00:10:14,329 --> 00:10:15,695
[Gojyo] Holy shit!

154
00:10:26,983 --> 00:10:30,523
<i>Where the hell am I?</i>

155
00:10:30,523 --> 00:10:33,684
[Rashu] I see you
are finally awake.

156
00:10:33,684 --> 00:10:35,651
[Sanzo] So you didn't die?

157
00:10:35,751 --> 00:10:38,484
[Rashu] My physical
body was destroyed, yes.

158
00:10:38,584 --> 00:10:42,317
What you see before you is the
entrance to the world beyond.

159
00:10:42,417 --> 00:10:45,351
Please don't continue on
your way on my account.

160
00:10:45,451 --> 00:10:49,284
My orders are to take the Maten
Scripture you carry and deliver

161
00:10:49,384 --> 00:10:53,984
it immdediately to Houtou
Castle, and I intend to.

162
00:10:54,084 --> 00:10:57,117
But unfortunately, it has taken
all the energy I have to

163
00:10:57,217 --> 00:11:01,051
lock you away in this place,
so that will have to wait.

164
00:11:02,251 --> 00:11:03,984
My, that is a real bummer.

165
00:11:04,084 --> 00:11:08,017
Excuse me if I'm not impressed
by your loyal service.

166
00:11:08,117 --> 00:11:10,551
I'm not finished with you yet.

167
00:11:10,651 --> 00:11:14,651
My soul still lives.
I could easily take
control of your body,

168
00:11:14,751 --> 00:11:18,851
and there's nothing you
could do to prevent me from
carrying the scriptures back

169
00:11:18,951 --> 00:11:22,617
to Houtou Castle on
your own two feet.

170
00:11:23,384 --> 00:11:25,517
Ha! How absurd!

171
00:11:25,617 --> 00:11:27,917
I'd like to see you try.

172
00:11:28,484 --> 00:11:29,617
[Rashu laughs]

173
00:11:30,151 --> 00:11:32,584
[Goku] Sanzo!

174
00:11:32,684 --> 00:11:34,817
Damn it! Why can't he hear me?!

175
00:11:34,917 --> 00:11:37,317
Hey Sanzo!

176
00:11:38,984 --> 00:11:41,751
[Gojyo] It looks
like a giant turd.

177
00:11:41,851 --> 00:11:44,384
You are so grossing
me out, you know that?

178
00:11:44,484 --> 00:11:46,317
[Goku] Sanzo!

179
00:11:46,417 --> 00:11:48,117
[Gojyo] Did you...?
[Hakkai] I heard it too!

180
00:11:48,217 --> 00:11:51,151
Goku's definitely
inside that thing.

181
00:11:51,251 --> 00:11:53,484
How the hell do we get in there?

182
00:11:53,584 --> 00:11:56,151
Do you think we should
try to destroy it?

183
00:11:56,251 --> 00:11:57,951
We might hurt whoever's inside.

184
00:11:58,051 --> 00:12:00,417
[Gojyo] What choice do we have?

185
00:12:00,517 --> 00:12:02,584
[Rashu] Very good, Sanzo.

186
00:12:02,684 --> 00:12:04,617
You have a strong mind.

187
00:12:04,751 --> 00:12:07,384
But in the end, you
can not stop it.

188
00:12:07,484 --> 00:12:12,151
Finding your weakness will
simply be a matter of time.

189
00:12:12,251 --> 00:12:15,951
Sorry, but I don't recall
having any weakness.

190
00:12:16,051 --> 00:12:20,084
Perhaps not now, but
what of your past?

191
00:12:20,184 --> 00:12:24,617
What do you think I'd find if I
probed deep into your memories?

192
00:12:24,717 --> 00:12:26,451
I do wonder.

193
00:12:26,551 --> 00:12:29,417
I'll bet that's where
I'll find your weakness.

194
00:12:29,517 --> 00:12:31,884
Don't... be...

195
00:12:36,584 --> 00:12:37,884
<i>[Sanzo] Koumyouo...</i>

196
00:12:49,717 --> 00:12:52,817
[Kouryou] Excuse me, master.
[Koumyoou] What is it?

197
00:12:52,917 --> 00:12:57,951
I don't understand. Why are
you smoking out here in the open
where someone's sure to see you?

198
00:12:58,051 --> 00:13:02,384
I guess, it's just such
a lovely autumn day.

199
00:13:02,484 --> 00:13:04,884
Yes it is, but what does that
have to do with anything?

200
00:13:04,984 --> 00:13:08,817
There's really no harm done,
as long as nothing burns.

201
00:13:08,917 --> 00:13:14,484
Yeah, I guess. But if you
burn all these leaves for me,
I won't have to rake them.

202
00:13:14,584 --> 00:13:20,117
Kouryuu, the river rat. That's
what they call you, isn't it?

203
00:13:20,217 --> 00:13:22,317
It's not a very nice name.

204
00:13:22,417 --> 00:13:25,951
Anyone who calls you that
is a monk in name only.

205
00:13:26,051 --> 00:13:27,851
He is not your friend.

206
00:13:27,951 --> 00:13:29,984
[Kouryou] It's alright.
It doesn't bother me.

207
00:13:30,084 --> 00:13:32,484
I'm used to being called
things like that.

208
00:13:32,584 --> 00:13:38,984
And besides, to be honest, I
actually kind of like my name.

209
00:13:39,084 --> 00:13:43,551
[Sanzo] Kouryuu,
a name referring to
the Changjiang river.

210
00:13:43,651 --> 00:13:47,784
How could I take offense to
being compared to something
so grand and majestic.

211
00:13:47,884 --> 00:13:50,617
I don't understand you
at all, not in the least.

212
00:13:50,717 --> 00:13:54,417
I know that the Buddha
extols the Heavenly virtues
of preserving all life,

213
00:13:54,517 --> 00:13:59,384
but you not only risked
your own life to save me
from that raging river,

214
00:13:59,484 --> 00:14:02,417
but you took me in,
and kept me at your side.

215
00:14:02,517 --> 00:14:04,817
It was because of the
sound of your voice.

216
00:14:04,917 --> 00:14:08,684
[Kouryou] Huh?
[Koumyou] You called out
to me, repeatedly.

217
00:14:08,784 --> 00:14:14,817
You called out so many
times. I had never seen
such will in a child before.

218
00:14:14,917 --> 00:14:19,551
[Sanzo] I cried out to
him, and he heard me.

219
00:14:20,751 --> 00:14:22,917
You were so noisy, I
had to take you with me.

220
00:14:23,017 --> 00:14:25,084
You were driving me crazy.

221
00:14:25,184 --> 00:14:27,517
I'm sorry, I don't
quite understand.

222
00:14:27,617 --> 00:14:30,984
One day, Kouryou, you will
hear a voice all out to you.

223
00:14:31,084 --> 00:14:33,517
Then you will understand.

224
00:14:33,617 --> 00:14:35,217
[Kouryou] If I ever
did hear that voice,

225
00:14:35,317 --> 00:14:37,517
I would take him in, too.

226
00:14:37,617 --> 00:14:40,517
I would teach him discipline
and obedience with my fan.

227
00:14:48,517 --> 00:14:50,151
I could save him.

228
00:14:58,917 --> 00:15:02,817
Man, this giant shit pile ain't
easy to break into. It's tough.

229
00:15:02,917 --> 00:15:05,184
Those soldiers might have
been easy to defeat.

230
00:15:05,284 --> 00:15:08,651
Their armor on the
other hand seems to
be a whole nother story.

231
00:15:08,751 --> 00:15:11,684
[Gojyo] Actually, there was one
of us who was able to do it.

232
00:15:16,517 --> 00:15:18,384
If that's the case, then...

233
00:15:18,484 --> 00:15:21,451
[Gojyo] The only person
who can save Sanzo is Sanzo.

234
00:15:23,084 --> 00:15:25,117
Then I'll guess we
just have to wait.

235
00:15:32,084 --> 00:15:35,784
[Abbott] You say burglars
broke into Master Sanzo's
room last night,

236
00:15:35,884 --> 00:15:38,717
murdered him, and took
the Seiten Scripture?

237
00:15:38,817 --> 00:15:40,984
Is this what you're saying?

238
00:15:41,084 --> 00:15:43,151
Speak. Speak up child.

239
00:15:43,251 --> 00:15:45,851
[Kouryou] Yes, that's
how it happened.

240
00:15:45,951 --> 00:15:49,317
Abbott, please allow me to
make up for my negligence by

241
00:15:49,417 --> 00:15:55,984
granting me leave so that
I may avenge my master and
reclaim the Seiten Scripture.

242
00:15:56,084 --> 00:16:01,184
Last night, my master bestowed
the holy name right before
he passed away.

243
00:16:03,984 --> 00:16:08,084
Genjo Sanzo, that is my
name from this day forth.

244
00:16:10,117 --> 00:16:13,617
Then this must be Buddha's will.

245
00:16:13,717 --> 00:16:18,651
With Koumyou Sanzo's gold
crown, I hereby recognize you

246
00:16:18,751 --> 00:16:23,117
as Priest Toua Genjo
Sanzo the thirty first,

247
00:16:23,217 --> 00:16:26,751
formal heir to the Seiten
and Maten Scriptures,

248
00:16:26,851 --> 00:16:30,717
two of the five founding
parchments of heaven and earth.

249
00:16:32,317 --> 00:16:36,484
All kinds of monsters and evil
spirits inhabit these mountains.

250
00:16:36,584 --> 00:16:39,751
It's too dangerous for you
to travel unarmed. But that,

251
00:16:39,851 --> 00:16:42,617
at least, can
easily be rectified.

252
00:16:46,017 --> 00:16:47,484
[Kouryou] What is this is?

253
00:16:47,584 --> 00:16:51,651
[Abbott] It is the
temple armory. You may
take whatever you like.

254
00:16:51,751 --> 00:16:57,384
Choose well, and remember,
the most terrify beings
often walk the earth as men.

255
00:17:01,417 --> 00:17:03,451
This is all I need.

256
00:17:03,551 --> 00:17:06,351
[Abbott] As you wish.

257
00:17:06,451 --> 00:17:10,584
[Sanzo] A weapon small
enough to aim at my own
temple. If it came to that.

258
00:17:12,217 --> 00:17:13,717
I found it!

259
00:17:13,817 --> 00:17:18,017
The losing the master you
loved and revered, you
fled down the mountain.

260
00:17:18,117 --> 00:17:21,751
Frightened, uncertain,
and alone! You murdered
countless others,

261
00:17:21,851 --> 00:17:29,217
until you eventually found
yourself unable to see the value
in any life, including yours!

262
00:17:32,017 --> 00:17:34,384
[Goku] Sanzo!

263
00:17:34,484 --> 00:17:38,017
No! I-I can't reach him!

264
00:17:38,584 --> 00:17:39,684
Sanzo...

265
00:17:41,551 --> 00:17:43,151
Not again!

266
00:17:43,251 --> 00:17:45,784
I'm trapped and
I can't reach him!

267
00:17:55,017 --> 00:17:58,817
[Rashu] A monk of the order,
with his hands stained in blood.

268
00:17:58,917 --> 00:18:02,817
Hypocrite. How many of Buddha's
teachings have you perverted?

269
00:18:02,917 --> 00:18:07,151
What sacred writing have you
twisted to justify your sins?

270
00:18:07,251 --> 00:18:09,517
How do you keep living?!

271
00:18:31,217 --> 00:18:33,617
I can hear a voice.

272
00:18:33,717 --> 00:18:35,351
What?!

273
00:18:41,917 --> 00:18:45,484
[Sanzo] Do you have
anything more to say?

274
00:18:45,617 --> 00:18:49,684
No matter how red my
hands become, blood
can be washed away.

275
00:18:56,017 --> 00:18:58,384
That is how we continue living.

276
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:17,073
[Hakkai] Sanzo?!
[Gojyo] Goku?

277
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:20,440
You found a way out!

278
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:22,906
After some silly psychoanalysis.

279
00:19:23,006 --> 00:19:25,406
What were you guys
doing in there?

280
00:19:25,506 --> 00:19:26,640
Listening.

281
00:19:28,073 --> 00:19:30,406
Listening for a voice.

282
00:19:30,506 --> 00:19:33,640
[Koumyou] One day,
Kouryou, you will hear
a voice call out to you.

283
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:35,440
Then you will understand.

284
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:38,373
What are you looking at?

285
00:19:40,773 --> 00:19:44,340
[Sanzo] How could I possibly
ignore someone so noisey?

286
00:19:46,006 --> 00:19:51,106
[Goddess] If people must
kill in order to live, the
blood can be washed away.

287
00:19:51,206 --> 00:19:55,506
How, Merciful Goddess, do
they survive with such a
warped sense of morality?

288
00:19:55,640 --> 00:20:01,940
Jiroushin, do you know why we,
the gods, exist here in Heaven?

289
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:06,640
It's not to look down on them,
but to watch over them.

290
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:09,140
To watch over those
who were born to live!

291
00:20:18,873 --> 00:20:21,506
[Jiroushin] So do you approve
of how things are going?

292
00:20:21,606 --> 00:20:25,473
I just told you that
I'm not here to sit
in judgment, Jiroushin.

293
00:20:25,573 --> 00:20:28,506
I could never change who
they are in a million years.

294
00:20:28,606 --> 00:20:30,640
Isn't that right, Nataku?

295
00:20:31,906 --> 00:20:35,273
They have no shortage of
challenges ahead of them.

296
00:20:35,373 --> 00:20:40,406
So ride west, Sanzo.
No matter what you may
run into along the way.

297
00:20:40,506 --> 00:20:44,706
Head west, even if you
leave behind a trail corpses.

298
00:22:25,006 --> 00:22:27,040
[Sanzo] To live in the moment.

299
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:29,373
To protect the ones we love.

300
00:22:29,473 --> 00:22:31,673
To change the future.

301
00:22:31,773 --> 00:22:34,940
Those are the reason these
