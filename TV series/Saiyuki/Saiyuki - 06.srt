1
00:01:36,724 --> 00:01:38,883
[Sanzo] Shit, it looks
like rain.

2
00:01:38,883 --> 00:01:41,083
[Gojyo] There's got to be an inn
around here somewhere.

3
00:01:41,183 --> 00:01:44,483
[Sanzo] I've got a 1000 yen
that says it starts pouring
before we find a place.

4
00:01:44,583 --> 00:01:45,616
[Gojyo] You're on.

5
00:01:45,716 --> 00:01:47,083
[Hakkai] That's a sissy bet.

6
00:01:47,183 --> 00:01:49,316
Let's put some real money on it.

7
00:01:49,416 --> 00:01:52,749
What's wrong, Goku? Have to take
a piss?

8
00:01:52,849 --> 00:01:54,116
No, it's just...

9
00:01:54,216 --> 00:01:56,283
I smell something weird.

10
00:01:56,383 --> 00:01:58,949
[Sanzo] Yeah, something's
not right.

11
00:01:59,049 --> 00:02:00,183
[Goku] Stop!

12
00:02:06,449 --> 00:02:08,449
What the hell happened here?

13
00:02:12,283 --> 00:02:13,916
Those talismans...

14
00:02:29,183 --> 00:02:31,249
[Hakkai] Looks like I owe you a
1000 yen.

15
00:02:33,149 --> 00:02:35,949
Here, I've brought everyone some
hot tea!

16
00:02:36,049 --> 00:02:37,149
[Hakkai] Over there please.

17
00:02:37,249 --> 00:02:40,249
You're lucky I had a last minute
vacancy, you know.

18
00:02:40,349 --> 00:02:42,283
[Gojyo] This is a dump.

19
00:02:42,383 --> 00:02:45,449
[Sanzo] And I thought those
demon corpses would be the
low point of the evening.

20
00:02:45,549 --> 00:02:48,349
Oh, that must be Rikudo again.

21
00:02:48,449 --> 00:02:50,249
[Hakkai] Rikudo?
[Goku] Who's that?

22
00:02:50,349 --> 00:02:53,316
[Lady] Who's Rikudo? You guys
must be from the East,

23
00:02:53,416 --> 00:02:57,583
we don't know much about him
but he's considered a savior
around here.

24
00:02:57,683 --> 00:03:02,149
They say he's a monk who wanders
the country side slaying demons.

25
00:03:02,249 --> 00:03:04,116
Few have ever actually seen him,

26
00:03:04,216 --> 00:03:08,849
but those who have say he's 7ft
tall with talismans all over
his body.

27
00:03:08,949 --> 00:03:11,716
Capable of destroying a hundred
demons at a pop.

28
00:03:11,816 --> 00:03:14,649
Now if you'll excuse me, I've
got some cookies in the oven.

29
00:03:14,749 --> 00:03:17,316
I'll bring you some.

30
00:03:17,416 --> 00:03:20,583
[Hakkai] That'd explain the
talismans we saw on those
corpses.

31
00:03:24,583 --> 00:03:29,549
<i>[Sanzo] Those talismans, I've</i>
<i>seen them somewhere before.</i>

32
00:03:31,116 --> 00:03:33,449
<i>That man?</i>

33
00:03:33,549 --> 00:03:35,049
<i>No, it can't be.</i>

34
00:03:35,149 --> 00:03:38,183
[Gojyo] So you live here too?
Where's your room?

35
00:03:38,283 --> 00:03:40,583
[Lady] Hmm, I'm not sure I
should tell you.

36
00:03:40,716 --> 00:03:42,883
[Gojyo] That's okay. Ever done
it in the rain?

37
00:03:42,983 --> 00:03:44,983
[Lady] [nervous] Oh, you.

38
00:03:47,149 --> 00:03:51,183
[Sanzo] Shit, Gojyo! Can't I
leave you alone for one minute
without you chasing after
some tart?

39
00:03:51,283 --> 00:03:53,849
[Gojyo] Don't take out your
sexual frustrations on
me, cleric!

40
00:03:53,949 --> 00:03:56,916
[Sanzo] Remember the mess
you got us in after your
ast escapade?

41
00:03:57,016 --> 00:03:59,083
[Gojyo] What kind of faggot
fights with a fan anyway?

42
00:03:59,183 --> 00:04:01,116
[Sanzo] The kind that can kick
your ass!

43
00:04:01,216 --> 00:04:03,449
How nice of you to let us stay
here for the night.

44
00:04:03,549 --> 00:04:06,216
And thanks again so much for the
wonderful tea.

45
00:04:06,316 --> 00:04:09,083
I promise you'll hardly even
know we're here at all.

46
00:04:12,683 --> 00:04:13,849
<i>That rain.</i>

47
00:04:14,816 --> 00:04:16,583
<i>So familar.</i>

48
00:04:16,683 --> 00:04:18,583
<i>[Koumyou] Rain is the bringer</i>
<i>of life,</i>

49
00:04:18,683 --> 00:04:22,583
<i>yet it becomes dispiriting when</i>
<i>it carries on like this,</i>
<i>eh, Kouryuu?</i>

50
00:04:22,683 --> 00:04:26,716
<i>[Kouryuu] I'm sure it will let</i>
<i>up soon, Master Sanzo.</i>
<i>It always does.</i>

51
00:04:30,683 --> 00:04:32,216
[Sanzo] Kouryuu, river orphen,
that's what they called me then.

52
00:04:37,249 --> 00:04:39,049
[Monk 1] Here he comes again.

53
00:04:39,149 --> 00:04:43,083
[Monk 2] His parents cast him
into the river the instant he
was born,

54
00:04:43,183 --> 00:04:46,083
now he struts around like he
thinks he's the star pupil.

55
00:04:46,183 --> 00:04:51,583
[Monk 3] I don't care how good
he is at meditation and martial
arts he'll always be a
river rat.

56
00:04:51,683 --> 00:04:55,016
[Monk 1] Master always had
soft spot for lost causes.

57
00:04:55,116 --> 00:04:58,383
[Monk 2] If it rains long enough
maybe we can toss him in the
water again.

58
00:04:58,483 --> 00:04:59,283
See if he floats.

59
00:04:59,383 --> 00:05:01,383
[Monks laugh]

60
00:05:01,483 --> 00:05:03,349
[Monk 1] Owowowowow!

61
00:05:03,449 --> 00:05:07,749
Shouldn't you two be attending
to your chores? Rather than
sitting around chit chatting?

62
00:05:07,849 --> 00:05:09,016
Clerk Abbot!

63
00:05:09,116 --> 00:05:11,183
Maybe you guys would like
to focus some of that energy

64
00:05:11,283 --> 00:05:13,116
on cleaning the outhouses.

65
00:05:13,216 --> 00:05:14,349
[Monk 1] Yes sir.

66
00:05:16,616 --> 00:05:19,616
You haven't changed, Shuei.

67
00:05:19,716 --> 00:05:22,016
Neither have you, river rat.

68
00:05:23,316 --> 00:05:25,983
So, I hear your Master Sanzo's
star pupil,

69
00:05:26,083 --> 00:05:30,516
one of our highest-ranking
monks, and capable of routing
a full-grown man to boot.

70
00:05:30,616 --> 00:05:33,449
[Kouryuu] You should see the
weaklings they pit me against.

71
00:05:33,549 --> 00:05:35,283
[Shoei] And full of
confidence too.

72
00:05:35,383 --> 00:05:37,316
No wonder they're all green
with envy.

73
00:05:37,416 --> 00:05:39,583
Not that you should let
that bother you.

74
00:05:39,683 --> 00:05:44,916
But knowing you, it probably
doesn't at all.

75
00:05:45,016 --> 00:05:47,183
Boy am I glad I'm the
Clerk Abbot.

76
00:05:47,283 --> 00:05:50,149
Otherwise I might have to spar
you in practice.

77
00:05:50,249 --> 00:05:51,883
[Kouryuu] Yeah, whatever.

78
00:05:51,983 --> 00:05:57,449
Shuei the talisman user, the
man who went directly from
apprentice to Clerk Abbot.

79
00:05:57,549 --> 00:06:00,583
There's not a monk who
doesn't know about your
talismanic powers.

80
00:06:00,683 --> 00:06:03,783
Aw, flatterer.

81
00:06:03,883 --> 00:06:08,649
[Shuei] Which reminds me, I hear
you're being given a holy name.
Congratulations.

82
00:06:08,749 --> 00:06:10,216
[Kouryuu] It's about time.

83
00:06:10,316 --> 00:06:12,716
Anything's better that Kouryuu
the river rat.

84
00:06:12,816 --> 00:06:14,449
Kouryuu the river orphen.

85
00:06:14,549 --> 00:06:17,683
[Shuei] Kouryuu the drift wood.

86
00:06:17,783 --> 00:06:23,049
But why would you take on a holy
name if you have no intention
of ever embracing the faith?

87
00:06:23,149 --> 00:06:26,016
[Kouryuu] I reserve all my faith
for Master Sanzo.

88
00:06:27,683 --> 00:06:29,549
I have no place for gods.

89
00:06:31,916 --> 00:06:36,549
Though I can not believe in
deities, I do believe in myself.

90
00:06:36,649 --> 00:06:43,183
Master Sanzo saved my life
taking me in, but my reasons
for embracing him are not
so petty.

91
00:06:43,283 --> 00:06:46,716
Sanzo is the only person I will
ever call Master.

92
00:06:47,783 --> 00:06:49,216
[Shuei] How very like you.

93
00:06:52,183 --> 00:06:54,883
Clerk Abbot! I've been looking
all over for you!

94
00:06:54,983 --> 00:06:56,183
[Shuei] What is it?

95
00:06:56,283 --> 00:06:57,783
[Monk] An enormous bear has
broken inside the compound!

96
00:06:57,883 --> 00:07:03,416
It must be mad! No one is able
to stop it! What are we going
to do!

97
00:07:07,683 --> 00:07:09,783
[Monk] The eyes! Aim for
the eyes!

98
00:07:10,749 --> 00:07:13,716
It's fixing to attack! Get back!
Get back!

99
00:07:15,249 --> 00:07:16,316
Get him out of there!

100
00:07:16,416 --> 00:07:19,283
Our spears are just like twigs
against that thing

101
00:07:19,383 --> 00:07:21,349
Damn it! Then I'll stop him!

102
00:07:24,549 --> 00:07:25,683
[Shuei] Kouryuu?

103
00:07:28,583 --> 00:07:30,916
Be calm. I can take care
of this.

104
00:07:38,283 --> 00:07:41,816
Turn back. There is no food for
you here.

105
00:07:48,783 --> 00:07:52,816
[Kouryuu] Listen to me, my
friend, go back and never
come back.

106
00:07:52,916 --> 00:07:56,516
And we in turn will never
violate your territory.

107
00:07:57,783 --> 00:08:01,149
Let us make this promise so that
we may coexisist.

108
00:08:01,249 --> 00:08:02,449
Understand?

109
00:08:03,249 --> 00:08:04,583
Do you understand?

110
00:08:13,483 --> 00:08:16,183
[quietly] The boy's not a river
rat, he's a demon.

111
00:08:16,283 --> 00:08:20,883
Only an evil spirit could
have that kind of super
natural power.

112
00:08:20,983 --> 00:08:23,516
[Monk] Is something wrong,
Master Sanzo?

113
00:08:23,616 --> 00:08:25,849
Nothing that wasn't expected.

114
00:08:27,749 --> 00:08:28,949
[Knock at the door]

115
00:08:29,049 --> 00:08:30,616
[Shuei] I'm coming in, Kouryuu.

116
00:08:30,716 --> 00:08:33,583
Master Sanzo wants to see you.

117
00:08:42,683 --> 00:08:45,749
Sorry, I must have spaced out
there. Say again?

118
00:08:45,849 --> 00:08:49,016
I said, Master Sanzo is calling
for you.

119
00:08:50,249 --> 00:08:51,449
Yes, of course.

120
00:08:53,483 --> 00:08:55,483
[Shuei] Someone said you were an
evil spirit,

121
00:08:55,583 --> 00:09:01,716
but just now, sitting in the
window, you looked like
something else.

122
00:09:01,816 --> 00:09:05,316
The way the moon created a halo
around your golden hair,

123
00:09:05,416 --> 00:09:08,983
and your eyes violet,
just like...

124
00:09:09,083 --> 00:09:10,383
[Kouryuu] Shuei.

125
00:09:10,483 --> 00:09:12,316
I have something for you.

126
00:09:13,816 --> 00:09:18,049
[Shuei] But these are the beads
they found on you in the river.

127
00:09:18,149 --> 00:09:19,483
Are you sure?

128
00:09:21,183 --> 00:09:22,783
[Kouryuu] I've never given
anyone anything before.

129
00:09:22,883 --> 00:09:25,683
I'm sure, but guard them well.

130
00:09:33,049 --> 00:09:34,216
I promise.

131
00:09:37,883 --> 00:09:41,916
[Sanzo Narrating] And so the
tranquility of the night faded.

132
00:09:42,016 --> 00:09:46,516
And in the morning we woke to
a nightmare.

133
00:09:46,616 --> 00:09:48,216
[Monk] Master Sanzo!

134
00:09:58,149 --> 00:10:00,749
<i>I haven't thought about that</i>
<i>day in years.</i>

135
00:10:02,316 --> 00:10:03,783
You had a bad dream?

136
00:10:04,449 --> 00:10:05,349
[Sanzo] Yes.

137
00:10:05,449 --> 00:10:07,449
I heard you wake up from the
next room.

138
00:10:07,549 --> 00:10:09,083
[Sanzo] Sorry...
[Hakkai] No,

139
00:10:09,183 --> 00:10:12,683
the rain also gives me a
little trouble sleeping.

140
00:10:12,783 --> 00:10:14,149
[Sanzo] That's what it is then.

141
00:10:15,616 --> 00:10:18,016
It's... because of the rain.

142
00:10:19,216 --> 00:10:21,049
[Lady screams]

143
00:10:21,183 --> 00:10:22,183
[Hakkai] It came from
he kitchen!

144
00:10:22,283 --> 00:10:23,416
[Lady] Help!

145
00:10:25,749 --> 00:10:26,316
[Gojyo] What's wrong?!

146
00:10:26,416 --> 00:10:27,549
[Lady] A demon!

147
00:10:28,483 --> 00:10:37,916
[Demon breathing loudly,
growling]

148
00:10:38,016 --> 00:10:40,016
Why you bastard! How could you?!

149
00:10:41,616 --> 00:10:44,183
You ate all the cookies!

150
00:10:44,283 --> 00:10:45,849
Goku, look out behind you!

151
00:10:47,449 --> 00:10:48,749
Eat this!

152
00:10:52,416 --> 00:10:55,216
You know, I've never seen you
this active in the morning.

153
00:10:55,316 --> 00:10:56,983
I have my days.

154
00:10:57,083 --> 00:10:59,783
Kicking demon ass is better than
coffee for me.

155
00:11:06,716 --> 00:11:08,716
That is so disgusting, man.

156
00:11:08,816 --> 00:11:11,249
[Rikudo] I draw upon the power
of the talisman to banish these
demons from the world...

157
00:11:11,349 --> 00:11:13,483
<i>[Sanzo] That voice!</i>
[Rikudo] <i>of the living</i>

158
00:11:13,583 --> 00:11:15,983
[Rikudo] nd send them back
where they came from.

159
00:11:16,083 --> 00:11:19,316
[Rikudo] Hear my name, demons,
I am Rikudo.

160
00:11:19,416 --> 00:11:22,749
And I will rid the earth of
every last one of you.

161
00:11:22,849 --> 00:11:25,049
<i>I'd recognize those</i>
<i>beads anywhere.</i>

162
00:11:26,516 --> 00:11:27,616
<i>Shuei!</i>

163
00:11:35,517 --> 00:11:37,216
[Lady] How can we ever thank you
so much, Master Rikudo!

164
00:11:37,216 --> 00:11:40,016
[Rikudo] Slaying demons is my
only reward.

165
00:11:40,682 --> 00:11:42,349
[Gojyo] This guy's Rikudo?

166
00:11:45,449 --> 00:11:47,849
<i>[Sanzo] So Shuei is the</i>
<i>demon slayer.</i>

167
00:11:48,949 --> 00:11:51,649
<i>But something's changed in him.</i>

168
00:11:51,749 --> 00:11:55,216
<i>It's as if he's suddenly taken</i>
<i>on an evil presence.</i>

169
00:11:55,349 --> 00:11:57,982
Whoever he is, he sure took care
of that problem for us.

170
00:11:58,082 --> 00:12:00,182
That's right. Back to bed!

171
00:12:00,282 --> 00:12:02,182
[Rikudo] Wait.

172
00:12:02,282 --> 00:12:04,749
[Rikudo] Not all of you
are human.
[Gojyo] What?

173
00:12:04,849 --> 00:12:08,482
[Hakkai] So tell me, Mr.
Brainstorm, whatever gave
you that idea?

174
00:12:08,582 --> 00:12:12,816
[Rikudo] I can smell you. I can
smell your stench from here.

175
00:12:12,916 --> 00:12:15,182
[Goku] You're no better roses
either, pal.

176
00:12:17,649 --> 00:12:21,782
[Rikudo] You... I made a vow to
destroy ALL demon kind!

177
00:12:21,882 --> 00:12:25,216
I don't think that's very nice,
you could at least get to
know us.

178
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:39,082
[Sanzo] Shuei...

179
00:12:40,116 --> 00:12:42,949
Is that anyway to greet
a friend?

180
00:12:45,882 --> 00:12:47,149
It can't be!

181
00:12:47,949 --> 00:12:49,216
Certainly there's no point in

182
00:12:49,316 --> 00:12:52,049
wasting your talent offing
these pussies.

183
00:12:52,149 --> 00:12:54,082
Wait! You know him?!

184
00:12:54,182 --> 00:12:58,782
[Rikudo laughs]

185
00:12:58,882 --> 00:13:04,516
Funny I heard a rumor about a
renegade Sanzo priest
heading west,

186
00:13:04,616 --> 00:13:09,916
never thought I'd find him and
his band of demon misfits in a
place like this.

187
00:13:10,016 --> 00:13:13,949
So Kouryuu! Or I should say,
Genjo Sanzo!

188
00:13:14,049 --> 00:13:18,249
Did you forget that it was
vile like that that killed
your predecessor?

189
00:13:18,349 --> 00:13:20,716
Are enemies now friends?

190
00:13:20,816 --> 00:13:23,549
Well, Shuei, if that's still
your name.

191
00:13:23,649 --> 00:13:26,882
Did you forget what it means to
be a holy man of faith?

192
00:13:26,982 --> 00:13:28,582
Shuei didn't forget!

193
00:13:28,682 --> 00:13:32,416
Shuei died the day you left the
temple ten years ago!

194
00:13:36,749 --> 00:13:37,882
[Shuei] Let me through!

195
00:13:40,482 --> 00:13:41,649
Priest Sanzo!

196
00:13:43,282 --> 00:13:44,949
Kouryuu!

197
00:13:45,049 --> 00:13:46,182
What happened?!

198
00:13:51,982 --> 00:13:53,382
I couldn't save him.

199
00:14:00,949 --> 00:14:04,649
[Abbot] You say burglars broke
into Master Sanzo's room
last night,

200
00:14:04,749 --> 00:14:07,482
murdered him and took the
Seiten Scripture?

201
00:14:07,582 --> 00:14:12,349
Is this what you're saying?
Speak. Speak up child.

202
00:14:12,449 --> 00:14:14,249
[Kouryuu] Yes, that's how
it happened.

203
00:14:14,349 --> 00:14:18,816
My master was able to save the
Maten Scripture but it cost him
his life.

204
00:14:18,916 --> 00:14:23,616
Judging from their appearence I
can only assume they were,
well, a group of demons.

205
00:14:23,716 --> 00:14:25,549
[Monk A] You can't be serious!

206
00:14:25,649 --> 00:14:29,049
You don't actually expect us to
believe a story like that?

207
00:14:29,149 --> 00:14:31,982
More likely you killed Master
Sanzo and took the scripture
for yourself!

208
00:14:33,349 --> 00:14:35,449
How dare you say something
like that!

209
00:14:35,549 --> 00:14:37,882
[Kouryuu] No Shuei, it's true.

210
00:14:37,982 --> 00:14:42,982
Master Sanzo is dead and one of
the temple's sacred relics,
has been stolen.

211
00:14:43,082 --> 00:14:45,916
There's no excuse.

212
00:14:46,016 --> 00:14:50,116
Abbott, please allow me to make
up for my negligence by granting
me leave,

213
00:14:50,216 --> 00:14:53,716
so that I may avenge my master
and reclaim the Seiten
Scripture. I beg you.

214
00:14:55,816 --> 00:14:59,549
[Monk A] You better not be
trying to smooth talk your way
out of this!

215
00:15:02,416 --> 00:15:07,449
I admire your courage, but
everyone of use was responcible
for protecting the scriptures

216
00:15:07,549 --> 00:15:10,149
while they were within the
Kinzan Temple walls.

217
00:15:10,249 --> 00:15:13,649
Reclaiming them is not a burden
you should bear alone, my son.

218
00:15:13,749 --> 00:15:17,982
No Abbot. I'm afraid those
sacred scriptures belong
to me now.

219
00:15:18,749 --> 00:15:19,749
[Abbot] Explain.

220
00:15:19,849 --> 00:15:22,349
Last night, my master bestowed
the holy name

221
00:15:22,449 --> 00:15:24,316
right before he passed away.

222
00:15:27,649 --> 00:15:32,049
Genjo Sanzo, that is my name
from this day forth!

223
00:15:32,149 --> 00:15:33,782
[Monk A] That can't be!

224
00:15:33,882 --> 00:15:36,116
He bears the crimson chakra on
his forehead,

225
00:15:36,216 --> 00:15:41,749
a symbol passed down from Sanzo
to Sanzo. Only the one chosen by
Heaven may wear it.

226
00:15:44,082 --> 00:15:46,016
Then this must be Buddha's will.

227
00:15:46,116 --> 00:15:47,816
[Monk A] Abbott!

228
00:15:47,916 --> 00:15:50,716
[Abbot] With Koumyou Sanzo's
gold crown.

229
00:15:50,816 --> 00:15:57,149
I hereby recognize you as
Priest Toua Genjo Sanzo
the 31st,

230
00:15:57,249 --> 00:16:00,949
formal heir to the Seiten and
Maten Scriptures,

231
00:16:01,049 --> 00:16:05,682
two of the five Founding
Parchments of Heaven and Earth.

232
00:16:05,782 --> 00:16:11,149
[Rikudo] In the morning, you
descended the mountain to
exact your revenge.

233
00:16:11,249 --> 00:16:14,549
But that night, the demon
burglars attacked again

234
00:16:14,649 --> 00:16:18,049
for the Maten Scriptures they
failed to seize before,

235
00:16:18,149 --> 00:16:21,249
not knowing you had taken them
with you.

236
00:16:21,349 --> 00:16:24,282
If they could defeat you and
Master Sanzo,

237
00:16:24,382 --> 00:16:28,816
you can imagine what they did
to those defencless monks.

238
00:16:28,916 --> 00:16:35,182
I had no choice but to use a
forbidden talisman to cast a
curse upon myself.

239
00:16:35,282 --> 00:16:39,749
And acquire the power to
destroy all demons!

240
00:16:39,849 --> 00:16:42,182
You- You used the Spell
of Araya?!

241
00:16:42,282 --> 00:16:46,849
Of course! But once cast the
Spell of Araya can never
be reversed

242
00:16:46,949 --> 00:16:50,349
and I will never again
know mercy.

243
00:16:53,749 --> 00:16:56,549
The talisman starves for
the blood of demons.

244
00:16:56,682 --> 00:17:03,182
Only the devouring of their dark
souls can satisfy it and ease
my suffering.

245
00:17:03,282 --> 00:17:06,849
<i>That thing has complete</i>
<i>control over him.</i>

246
00:17:06,949 --> 00:17:11,949
I will know only pain so long
as demons walk upon the face
of the earth.

247
00:17:12,049 --> 00:17:16,516
For ten years I have murdered
their kind, innocent
or otherwise.

248
00:17:16,616 --> 00:17:19,316
But now that the demons have
started attacking humans,

249
00:17:19,416 --> 00:17:23,782
people have begun revering me as
some kind of hero!

250
00:17:23,882 --> 00:17:26,982
[Rikudo laughs maniacally]

251
00:17:27,082 --> 00:17:29,416
[Rikudo] Isn't that delicious?!

252
00:17:29,549 --> 00:17:31,749
He's just crackin' himself up.

253
00:17:31,849 --> 00:17:33,782
Yeah, and he calls us demons.

254
00:17:35,449 --> 00:17:38,016
Shuei...

255
00:17:38,116 --> 00:17:41,582
Surely you can see the talisman
has turned you into some kind
of a monster.

256
00:17:41,682 --> 00:17:44,782
I'll show you just what kind of
monster I am!

257
00:17:44,882 --> 00:17:46,916
[Hakkai] I think it's about time
to go.

258
00:17:47,016 --> 00:17:48,149
[Goku] But it's raining!

259
00:17:48,249 --> 00:17:49,682
[Gojyo] Yeah, yeah and your
point is?

260
00:17:54,814 --> 00:17:56,454
[Gojyo] Man, this rain sucks!

261
00:17:56,454 --> 00:17:58,020
I can't see a thing.

262
00:17:58,120 --> 00:17:59,887
[Goku] Hakkai, behind you!

263
00:17:59,987 --> 00:18:01,120
What?

264
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:11,820
[Rikudo] I wouldn't try that. I
can dissolve you by the mere
touch of my hand.

265
00:18:13,154 --> 00:18:15,020
Let go of him, prune face!

266
00:18:16,987 --> 00:18:18,654
Whoa this ground is slick.

267
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:22,520
[Goku] Well don't just
stand there.

268
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:23,987
[Rikudo] Yes, aren't you going
to help your demon friends?

269
00:18:26,287 --> 00:18:30,420
No I'm not. Because you know it
doesn't really matter if I help
these guys or not,

270
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:32,820
believe me they won't
die anyway.

271
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:34,220
That's true enough.

272
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:37,520
Besides, he probably wouldn't be
praying for our souls anyway.

273
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:40,354
We'll see about that!

274
00:18:40,454 --> 00:18:43,954
<i>[Sanzo] But as great as they</i>
<i>are, one was greater.</i>

275
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:46,654
[Kouyruu] What are you
doing, Master?

276
00:18:46,754 --> 00:18:48,320
Shouldn't you be teaching?

277
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:53,920
Right now, I'm making
paper airplanes.

278
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:57,520
It's about the only skill I have
worth passing on to others, in
my opinion.

279
00:18:59,354 --> 00:19:01,587
All I ever need to know,

280
00:19:01,687 --> 00:19:03,754
I learned by folding
paper airplanes.

281
00:19:05,354 --> 00:19:07,087
[Koumyou] Isn't it marvelous?

282
00:19:07,187 --> 00:19:11,120
The way the orange accents the
blue and vise versa.

283
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:16,120
Because these color are
opposites each enhances what
is distinctive about the other.

284
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:22,787
Ah, a trifling thing I suppose.

285
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:25,487
[Kouryuu] Not at all.

286
00:19:26,154 --> 00:19:27,687
It's beautiful.

287
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:34,720
<i>[Sanzo] He gave me something</i>
<i>that day, something I wanted</i>
<i>to protect.</i>

288
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:38,554
<i>And when it was taken from me,</i>
<i>I learned how small I was.</i>

289
00:19:38,654 --> 00:19:42,254
<i>I vowed to never again care for</i>
<i>someone so much.</i>

290
00:19:42,354 --> 00:19:44,087
<i>I couldn't bear to lose them.</i>

291
00:19:45,554 --> 00:19:47,820
All of our spells are useless
against this guy.

292
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:50,520
None of my attacks have worked.
Any of you guys got any
bright ideas?

293
00:19:51,654 --> 00:19:53,287
[Hakkai] Have we tried running
away yet?

294
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:54,954
[Sanzo] Shuei...

295
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,587
Your avenging days are over.

296
00:19:58,687 --> 00:20:02,820
You know there is only one way
to end this curse.

297
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:04,020
[Goku] No!

298
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,387
[Sanzo] Get out of my way!

299
00:20:05,487 --> 00:20:08,920
How can you just go and kill him
like that without thinking?

300
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:10,554
Isn't he your friend?

301
00:20:14,954 --> 00:20:16,720
[Rikudo] You make me sick.

302
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:17,954
[Rikudo attacks]

303
00:20:25,387 --> 00:20:27,987
[Goku] Wait... Sanzo?

304
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:35,120
[Goku] Sanzo!

305
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:37,454
Sanzo, wake up! Sanzo, wake up!

306
00:20:37,554 --> 00:20:40,854
You weren't meant to die like
this! Just hold on man!

307
00:20:40,954 --> 00:20:44,120
[Sanzo] At least now I know.

308
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:45,854
He can't be redeemed.

309
00:20:45,954 --> 00:20:47,687
[Goku] Sanzo!

310
00:22:27,887 --> 00:22:31,920
[Goku] Sanzo! I can't believe he
did this to you!

311
00:22:33,687 --> 00:22:36,054
Sanzo! No!

312
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:41,120
Sanzo!

313
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:44,220
Sanzo!

314
00:22:45,487 --> 00:22:47,320
SANZO!
