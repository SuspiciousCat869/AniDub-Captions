1
00:02:02,428 --> 00:02:06,028
<i>[Shunhua] I'm sorry. We always</i>
<i>knew this would happen.</i>

2
00:02:09,428 --> 00:02:12,062
<i>[Xiahua] No one sought</i>
<i>this battle.</i>

3
00:02:16,262 --> 00:02:18,695
[Quihua] But...

4
00:02:18,795 --> 00:02:21,362
[The girls yell in distress]

5
00:02:23,195 --> 00:02:25,462
<i>[Donghua] We have no</i>
<i>choice but to fight.</i>

6
00:02:49,428 --> 00:02:50,962
[Shunhua] En garde!

7
00:03:04,962 --> 00:03:06,962
[Goku] Come on, Gojyo, can I?

8
00:03:07,062 --> 00:03:08,395
[Gojoy] It's not
for kids like you.

9
00:03:08,528 --> 00:03:10,962
Wouldn't you rather be sucking
on a pacifier or something?

10
00:03:11,062 --> 00:03:13,595
[Goku] Come on! Just
a little beer snack!

11
00:03:13,695 --> 00:03:15,795
You're such an alchy, I swear.

12
00:03:15,895 --> 00:03:18,795
[Gojyo] Just keep on
babbling, little one.

13
00:03:21,295 --> 00:03:22,795
Babes?

14
00:03:42,662 --> 00:03:45,162
[Shunhua] You've all
been such a huge help.

15
00:03:45,262 --> 00:03:47,262
I don't know how I
could ever thank you.

16
00:03:47,362 --> 00:03:49,695
[Goku] So, you girls
are sisters?

17
00:03:49,795 --> 00:03:52,728
That's right, but we're actually
pretty good friends as well.

18
00:03:52,828 --> 00:03:56,462
So tell me, are you guys on
some kind of religious quest?

19
00:03:56,562 --> 00:03:59,995
Actually, it's more along the
lines of a secular fieldtrip.

20
00:04:00,095 --> 00:04:03,428
I bet you gentlemen have seen
your fair share of adventure.

21
00:04:03,528 --> 00:04:04,928
It's not so bad.

22
00:04:05,028 --> 00:04:06,862
Sometimes Goku's feet smell,

23
00:04:06,962 --> 00:04:09,328
and that hothead monk's always
firing his gun off,

24
00:04:09,428 --> 00:04:10,495
but otherwise it's all right.

25
00:04:10,595 --> 00:04:13,195
And sometimes demons attack us.

26
00:04:28,262 --> 00:04:30,195
So, how do you like the food?

27
00:04:33,895 --> 00:04:37,928
I... heard this was the
best restaurant in town.

28
00:04:47,095 --> 00:04:48,962
[Shunhua] Well, I guess
we should be going now.

29
00:04:49,062 --> 00:04:50,595
[Xiahua] You're such lifesavers.

30
00:04:50,695 --> 00:04:53,462
[Quihua] We can't
thank you enough.

31
00:04:55,562 --> 00:04:58,095
Nice to meet you!

32
00:04:58,195 --> 00:05:00,062
[Goku] There they go.

33
00:05:00,162 --> 00:05:02,462
Goku, you have a crush on them?

34
00:05:02,562 --> 00:05:03,595
Don't be ridiculous!

35
00:05:03,695 --> 00:05:05,562
At least I don't chase
skirts around all year,

36
00:05:05,662 --> 00:05:08,162
unlike some people, you
perverted water sprite.

37
00:05:08,262 --> 00:05:10,828
[Gojyo] You don't have to chase
what doesn't run, geek!

38
00:05:10,928 --> 00:05:12,428
[Goku] Shut up, glamour boy!

39
00:05:12,528 --> 00:05:15,295
[Gojyo] Glamour boy?!
I'll show you stars!

40
00:05:15,395 --> 00:05:15,928
[Sanzo] Let's go.

41
00:05:16,028 --> 00:05:17,162
[Goku] Huh?

42
00:05:21,862 --> 00:05:26,862
What's eating you, Sanzo?
You look as if something's
bothering you.

43
00:05:28,128 --> 00:05:30,528
Don't get involved
with those girls.

44
00:05:30,628 --> 00:05:31,762
What?

45
00:05:36,495 --> 00:05:39,662
What did I tell you?
Those women are bad news.

46
00:05:39,762 --> 00:05:40,362
You don't...

47
00:05:40,462 --> 00:05:41,895
[Gojyo] Are you sure?

48
00:05:41,995 --> 00:05:46,728
I don't think those dames
had anything to do with
this. Right, Goku?

49
00:05:49,228 --> 00:05:50,462
[Sanzo] Still think
it's a coincidence?

50
00:05:50,562 --> 00:05:52,628
[Gojyo] Eh.

51
00:05:56,295 --> 00:05:58,328
Idiots.

52
00:06:01,328 --> 00:06:03,528
[Hakkai] Sanzo, look out!

53
00:06:11,128 --> 00:06:11,962
[Gojyo & Goku] Sanzo?

54
00:06:15,562 --> 00:06:18,162
You call THAT a coincidence?

55
00:06:18,262 --> 00:06:19,828
This shit happens.

56
00:06:19,928 --> 00:06:23,295
When someone's cooking, during
scientific experiments.

57
00:06:24,328 --> 00:06:26,195
Do what you want.

58
00:06:26,295 --> 00:06:28,695
I believe I'll do that.

59
00:06:29,428 --> 00:06:30,562
Gojyo, where...

60
00:06:30,662 --> 00:06:31,762
are you going?

61
00:06:31,862 --> 00:06:36,195
[Gojyo] I'm going to go
win me some pocket change.

62
00:06:36,295 --> 00:06:39,795
[Sanzo] We leave tomorrow.
You better not be late either.

63
00:06:51,662 --> 00:06:53,862
[Daiki] What took
you so long?

64
00:06:53,962 --> 00:06:57,128
You've had more than
enough time to kill them.

65
00:06:57,228 --> 00:07:00,428
Aren't we the ones
to decide that?

66
00:07:00,528 --> 00:07:02,428
We'll take care of them in time.

67
00:07:08,495 --> 00:07:12,495
You bitch! Do you
mean to defy me?!

68
00:07:12,595 --> 00:07:15,762
No, of course I don't...

69
00:07:15,862 --> 00:07:22,062
I could kill you and your
darling little sisters right
now. Is that what you want?

70
00:07:22,162 --> 00:07:23,595
You promised me
that you wouldn't!

71
00:07:23,695 --> 00:07:26,728
Do what you want with me, just
leave my sisters out of this!

72
00:07:26,828 --> 00:07:32,062
Then you better watch your
tone of voice with me.

73
00:07:32,162 --> 00:07:33,662
[Daiki] Don't worry.

74
00:07:33,762 --> 00:07:36,495
Once you get rid of Sanzo
and his companions,

75
00:07:36,595 --> 00:07:40,028
I'll leave your body.
Just like I promised.

76
00:07:40,128 --> 00:07:44,062
Then I'll let you and your
darling sisters free.

77
00:07:44,162 --> 00:07:47,562
I'm sure they'll be out of their
pretty little heads with joy.

78
00:07:47,662 --> 00:07:50,528
But that's only IF
you can kill them.

79
00:08:00,362 --> 00:08:02,128
Hey, Donghua!

80
00:08:02,228 --> 00:08:04,428
Hey!

81
00:08:06,962 --> 00:08:09,262
Hey there, handsome.

82
00:08:11,095 --> 00:08:12,495
You busy?

83
00:08:12,595 --> 00:08:13,228
[Gojyo] Not too busy for you.

84
00:08:17,695 --> 00:08:19,728
You guys are such a big help.

85
00:08:19,828 --> 00:08:21,895
It's not too heavy?

86
00:08:21,995 --> 00:08:23,228
Hello?

87
00:08:23,328 --> 00:08:28,062
Oh, no. Please don't mind us.
Light as a feather, really.

88
00:08:28,162 --> 00:08:29,562
Right, Goku?

89
00:08:29,662 --> 00:08:30,928
Speak for yourself.

90
00:08:31,028 --> 00:08:32,862
It's not too heavy, is it?

91
00:08:32,962 --> 00:08:35,895
Are you kidding? This is nothing
compared to my usual chores.

92
00:08:35,995 --> 00:08:38,495
You sure?

93
00:08:38,595 --> 00:08:40,095
Yeah.

94
00:08:42,362 --> 00:08:44,528
Money, money, money.

95
00:08:44,628 --> 00:08:47,728
What can I say? Sorry fellas.

96
00:08:50,128 --> 00:08:51,995
How's it going?

97
00:08:52,095 --> 00:08:53,828
Need I say anything?

98
00:08:53,928 --> 00:08:57,528
Looks like the goddess
of victory by my side.

99
00:09:01,362 --> 00:09:02,228
Hey, what's that?!

100
00:09:02,328 --> 00:09:03,895
Huh?

101
00:09:03,995 --> 00:09:06,995
[Donghua] Ha, ha, made you look!
You really are a stupid monkey.

102
00:09:07,095 --> 00:09:09,495
[Goku] Yeah! With
big, sharp teeth!

103
00:09:18,128 --> 00:09:20,562
[Gojyo] Shit. Should
I call, or...

104
00:09:20,662 --> 00:09:22,728
Time to call.

105
00:09:24,862 --> 00:09:27,795
How can I argue with the goddess
of victory?

106
00:09:27,895 --> 00:09:29,895
[Gojyo] Call!

107
00:09:31,862 --> 00:09:33,362
[Man] Shit.

108
00:09:52,662 --> 00:09:54,962
[Knocking. Door opens]

109
00:09:55,062 --> 00:09:59,962
I hope you don't mind.
I heard you were staying
at the same inn as us,

110
00:10:00,062 --> 00:10:02,995
so I took the liberty
of dropping by.

111
00:10:03,095 --> 00:10:04,628
So what do you want?

112
00:10:04,728 --> 00:10:07,128
I ran across a rather
rare bottle of wine,

113
00:10:07,228 --> 00:10:10,162
so I thought I might repay
you for being so kind.

114
00:10:55,864 --> 00:10:57,764
[Hakkai] Is something wrong?

115
00:10:59,397 --> 00:11:01,464
[Quihua] N-no.

116
00:11:04,764 --> 00:11:07,597
U-um, a-actually...

117
00:11:07,697 --> 00:11:12,330
[Hakkai] Would you share
a drink with me?

118
00:11:12,430 --> 00:11:16,264
You won't regret it. Promise.

119
00:11:16,364 --> 00:11:18,697
Sure.

120
00:11:34,964 --> 00:11:37,797
[Gojyo] Xiahua, go home.

121
00:11:37,897 --> 00:11:39,397
What?

122
00:11:41,964 --> 00:11:44,897
I'm not enough of a dog to take
a woman who's not interested.

123
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:51,064
Gojyo...

124
00:11:58,230 --> 00:12:02,564
Are you just going to sit there,
staring at me like that?

125
00:12:02,664 --> 00:12:06,430
Tell me why you approached us.

126
00:12:06,530 --> 00:12:09,397
I don't know what you're
up to, but don't do it.

127
00:12:09,497 --> 00:12:12,297
It's for your own good.

128
00:12:12,397 --> 00:12:13,897
Leave before tomorrow morning

129
00:12:13,997 --> 00:12:19,164
and never show your face to
me or any of my party again.

130
00:12:19,264 --> 00:12:23,097
[Shunhua] Sanzo, you don't
understand. We have no choice.

131
00:12:23,197 --> 00:12:26,264
My sisters and I have been
given one task to follow.

132
00:12:26,364 --> 00:12:29,664
Terrible things will
happen to us if we don't.

133
00:12:29,764 --> 00:12:32,697
I'm not sure if that's the right
thing to do or not, but...

134
00:12:34,764 --> 00:12:36,664
[Sanzo] What utter nonsense.

135
00:12:40,197 --> 00:12:43,830
What makes you think there
is only one path to take?

136
00:12:49,497 --> 00:12:52,197
You're right.

137
00:12:52,297 --> 00:12:55,064
You're right, of course.

138
00:12:55,164 --> 00:12:57,864
Thank you, Master Sanzo.

139
00:13:02,997 --> 00:13:05,330
But I would like to
ask you something.

140
00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:09,897
If this path before me should
disappear, would you...

141
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:13,330
Nevermind, it's nothing.

142
00:13:16,664 --> 00:13:18,864
<i>Chunhua...</i>

143
00:13:20,330 --> 00:13:22,997
[Daiki] How dare you?
You betrayed me!

144
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:31,397
Maybe you don't care about
your own life, but what about
the lives of your sisters?

145
00:13:31,497 --> 00:13:34,430
I will keep my promise, but
only on my own terms.

146
00:13:43,964 --> 00:13:45,364
[Quihua] Sister, I...

147
00:13:45,497 --> 00:13:48,330
I just can't believe
these four are villains.

148
00:13:48,430 --> 00:13:50,230
I'm afraid.

149
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:53,130
Afraid? Afraid of what?

150
00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:56,464
I'm afraid that I care for him.

151
00:13:56,564 --> 00:13:59,130
[Xiahua] Don't say that!

152
00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:02,530
There's nothing that either
of us can do about it.

153
00:14:04,930 --> 00:14:07,730
[Shunhua] I don't care what
happens to me, but please!

154
00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:10,030
Don't hurt my sisters!

155
00:14:10,130 --> 00:14:12,364
[The girls yell in distress]

156
00:14:15,064 --> 00:14:17,397
You and I both know that
demon promised he would

157
00:14:17,497 --> 00:14:22,130
leave Shunhua's body as
soon as we killed these
four people for him,

158
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:25,764
but how can we know for sure
that he will do anything
he has promised to do?

159
00:14:25,864 --> 00:14:28,464
[Donghua] That doesn't matter.

160
00:14:28,564 --> 00:14:33,830
The only reason you're alive now
is because Shunhua was willing
to sacrifice her life for us.

161
00:14:33,930 --> 00:14:37,764
I, for one, will do whatever
that demon wants to save her.

162
00:14:40,264 --> 00:14:41,864
<i>[Shunhua] The three</i>
<i>of you... run away.</i>

163
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:48,230
<i>Forget about me. We don't have</i>
<i>to let him control us anymore.</i>

164
00:14:48,330 --> 00:14:50,330
<i>You're free to</i>
<i>choose a new path.</i>

165
00:14:50,964 --> 00:14:52,930
[Quihua] Oh, sister...

166
00:14:56,264 --> 00:14:57,997
[Sanzo] Let's go, Goku.

167
00:14:58,097 --> 00:14:59,997
Uh, right.

168
00:15:08,664 --> 00:15:10,564
Huh?

169
00:15:15,330 --> 00:15:20,264
Genjo Sanzo, it's
time for you to die.

170
00:15:20,364 --> 00:15:22,897
Are you sure this
is what you want?

171
00:15:22,997 --> 00:15:24,897
[Quihua] It's what we ALL want.

172
00:15:26,897 --> 00:15:29,297
[Shunhua] I thought
I told you to run?!

173
00:15:29,397 --> 00:15:31,230
We're sorry, sister, but...

174
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:34,797
This is the path that we have
chosen to take together.

175
00:15:55,852 --> 00:15:58,786
[Goku] I don't understand...
What the hell is going on here?

176
00:16:07,052 --> 00:16:08,852
[Shunhua] En garde!

177
00:16:12,286 --> 00:16:14,852
My dates always end like this.

178
00:16:16,286 --> 00:16:19,652
I don't get it! Why do we always
have to fight each other?!

179
00:16:22,452 --> 00:16:23,019
Please! Stop it!

180
00:16:27,452 --> 00:16:28,819
<i>[Sanzo] Just as I thought...</i>

181
00:16:31,052 --> 00:16:32,886
[Hakkai] It's a scar
of a parasite demon.

182
00:16:32,986 --> 00:16:34,919
[Gojyo] Huh. So for
once, it wasn't me.

183
00:16:35,019 --> 00:16:40,652
I don't get it! What's
this all about?!

184
00:16:40,752 --> 00:16:43,586
She bares the scar
of a parasite demon.

185
00:16:43,686 --> 00:16:48,119
I'm afraid to say there's
probably a demon dwelling
inside her body.

186
00:16:48,219 --> 00:16:49,552
No way!

187
00:16:49,652 --> 00:16:53,219
Then if we kill the
whatchamacallit demon
inside her, then...

188
00:16:53,319 --> 00:16:55,752
[Hakkai] I'm afraid
that's impossible.

189
00:16:55,852 --> 00:17:00,886
[Hakkai] The demon has
probably assimilated all
her internal organs by now.

190
00:17:00,986 --> 00:17:04,319
Their two bodies are
indistinguishable from
one another.

191
00:17:04,419 --> 00:17:05,519
If we kill the parasite,
we kill the host.

192
00:17:09,019 --> 00:17:10,352
My god...

193
00:17:10,452 --> 00:17:13,419
[Donghua] Sister...

194
00:17:13,519 --> 00:17:14,986
You bastard!

195
00:17:15,086 --> 00:17:16,419
[Shunhua] Then he will die!

196
00:17:16,519 --> 00:17:19,086
And so will I!

197
00:17:20,519 --> 00:17:22,586
[All] Don't do it!

198
00:17:24,819 --> 00:17:29,619
[Daiki] Ah ah ah, not so fast,
my precious little host.

199
00:17:29,719 --> 00:17:30,919
You bastard.

200
00:17:31,019 --> 00:17:32,619
[Daiki] What fools.

201
00:17:32,719 --> 00:17:35,486
If you hadn't gone babbling
where you weren't wanted,

202
00:17:35,586 --> 00:17:38,952
these sweet girls wouldn't
have to go... changing.

203
00:17:39,052 --> 00:17:40,752
[Goyjo] What are you saying?

204
00:17:45,986 --> 00:17:47,586
Not Donghua!

205
00:17:47,686 --> 00:17:52,152
That bastard must have
planted seeds into all
Shunhua's sisters as well.

206
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:58,652
[Daiki] Did you actually
believe I could leave such
fertile host barren?

207
00:17:58,752 --> 00:18:02,686
You're not going to get
away with it, eyeball!

208
00:18:02,786 --> 00:18:05,719
[Daiki] Oh really? Are you
sure you could being yourself
to harm these lovely faces? Hm?

209
00:18:10,952 --> 00:18:13,486
Get them!

210
00:18:15,586 --> 00:18:18,419
[Hakkai] Goku, I could
use a little help here!

211
00:18:18,519 --> 00:18:22,052
But... I can't harm Donghua!

212
00:18:22,152 --> 00:18:23,452
[Hakkai] Goku!

213
00:18:23,552 --> 00:18:26,586
[Daiki] Kill me and the
lovely ladies die with me.

214
00:18:26,686 --> 00:18:29,919
Which one of you could
strike down such a beauty?

215
00:18:30,019 --> 00:18:32,786
You don't have the
balls to do it!

216
00:18:32,886 --> 00:18:36,186
[Shunhua] I would like
to ask you something.

217
00:18:36,286 --> 00:18:40,952
If this path before me should
disappear, would you...

218
00:18:42,552 --> 00:18:44,152
[Sanzo] So this
is what you want.

219
00:18:44,252 --> 00:18:46,452
[Daiki] What?!

220
00:18:46,552 --> 00:18:49,486
Demon who has taken up this
host, prepare to be bound!

221
00:19:00,752 --> 00:19:02,652
This is all over.

222
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:05,886
[Daiki] No, no please!

223
00:19:05,986 --> 00:19:07,752
Sanzo! Noooo!

224
00:19:07,852 --> 00:19:08,952
What's he doing?

225
00:19:09,052 --> 00:19:10,952
Don't do it, Sanzo!

226
00:19:11,052 --> 00:19:12,986
Let go of my hand, Goku!

227
00:19:13,086 --> 00:19:15,219
[Goku] Never!

228
00:19:15,319 --> 00:19:16,552
[Sanzo] Just let go!

229
00:19:16,652 --> 00:19:19,952
[Goku] I won't let go!
I'll never do it!

230
00:19:20,052 --> 00:19:25,252
That's Shunhua up there!
And Xiahua and Qiuhua!

231
00:19:25,352 --> 00:19:29,986
And Donghua! I just got
to know her, Sanzo!

232
00:19:30,086 --> 00:19:32,986
Why does it have
to end like this?!

233
00:19:33,086 --> 00:19:35,752
Stop it, Goku. I have to.

234
00:20:06,819 --> 00:20:08,752
[Donghua] Goku.

235
00:20:17,086 --> 00:20:19,886
So there was another
path to take.

236
00:20:29,286 --> 00:20:32,986
We've finally been freed from
all our pain and suffering.

237
00:20:36,019 --> 00:20:38,252
Thank you all so much.

238
00:22:26,019 --> 00:22:28,152
[Goku] What on earth was Sanzo
thinking, coming all the way

239
00:22:28,252 --> 00:22:32,052
out into the stinking desert,
looking for a demon hideout?

240
00:22:32,152 --> 00:22:34,252
We don't need to be
looking for trouble.

241
00:22:34,352 --> 00:22:35,686
Wait a minute.

242
00:22:35,786 --> 00:22:39,586
What's the deal with this sand?
Oh no, my feet are sinking!

243
00:22:39,686 --> 00:22:40,786
Could this be...

244
00:22:40,886 --> 00:22:43,619
Get sucked into,
"The Quicksand Trap".

245
00:22:43,719 --> 00:22:45,619
Next time on Saiyuki!
