1
00:01:38,554 --> 00:01:39,887
Merciful Goddess...

2
00:01:39,987 --> 00:01:42,934
What now? Your move was final.

3
00:01:42,934 --> 00:01:47,568
I was thinking of the
Sanzo party. Don't take
this the wrong way,

4
00:01:47,668 --> 00:01:50,401
but at first I thought you were
crazy to choose those four.

5
00:01:50,501 --> 00:01:52,001
[Merciful Goddess] Hm.
[Jiroushin] but I'm finally

6
00:01:52,101 --> 00:01:55,668
starting to see why you chose
that band of walking heretics.

7
00:01:55,768 --> 00:01:58,134
There is an eloquence to
the way they live that can

8
00:01:58,234 --> 00:02:01,734
teach more about life
than any holy lecture.

9
00:02:01,834 --> 00:02:04,968
I truly believe that.

10
00:02:05,068 --> 00:02:09,668
Honestly, it's not as deep as
all that. It's just that they...

11
00:02:09,768 --> 00:02:12,868
...choose to live
in the here and now.

12
00:02:17,834 --> 00:02:19,901
"The Quicksand Trap"

13
00:02:26,501 --> 00:02:28,934
[Goku] Uuuugh, I'm dyin'.

14
00:02:29,034 --> 00:02:33,268
It's hot enough out here
without having to wear these
stupid monk outfits.

15
00:02:33,368 --> 00:02:36,268
Go ahead and take it off if
you wanna get covered in sand.

16
00:02:36,368 --> 00:02:39,201
Now stop making me talk.
I'm getting sand in my mouth.

17
00:02:39,301 --> 00:02:42,634
Don't sit so close to
me. It's hot enough!

18
00:02:42,734 --> 00:02:46,268
Then stop crowding me,
you jerk. You're taking
up the whole backseat.

19
00:02:46,368 --> 00:02:49,334
You're clearly sitting on my
side of the seat, now move over!

20
00:02:49,434 --> 00:02:50,668
Wanna make me?!

21
00:02:51,934 --> 00:02:54,234
How badly do you
two want to be iced?

22
00:02:54,334 --> 00:02:56,268
[Both] Uh, not that badly.

23
00:02:56,368 --> 00:02:58,001
Please don't do it, Sanzo.

24
00:02:58,101 --> 00:03:01,001
They'll probably rot before
they get a chance to cool down.

25
00:03:01,101 --> 00:03:04,868
[Sanzo] It's a sea of
sand and desert as far
as the eye can see.

26
00:03:04,968 --> 00:03:07,668
[Hakkai] Telling some
ghost stories might
give us some chills.

27
00:03:07,801 --> 00:03:10,034
I know some without
demons in them.

28
00:03:10,134 --> 00:03:15,234
Ew, I think the last person
I want to hear horror stories
from is you, Hakkai.

29
00:03:15,334 --> 00:03:16,834
Huh?

30
00:03:16,934 --> 00:03:20,001
[Goku] Hey, I think
I see someone.

31
00:03:20,101 --> 00:03:22,234
Hey! Listen kid,

32
00:03:22,334 --> 00:03:25,568
how much further do we
need to go to get out
of this stinking desert?

33
00:03:25,668 --> 00:03:28,434
You've still got a long
way to go. It'll probably

34
00:03:28,534 --> 00:03:31,401
take you the whole night to
drive out of this desert.

35
00:03:31,501 --> 00:03:33,034
Ugh... for real?

36
00:03:33,134 --> 00:03:36,068
I was so hoping he had
better news than that.

37
00:03:36,168 --> 00:03:38,801
My village where I live is
close by. Why don't you guys
stay there for the night?

38
00:03:40,701 --> 00:03:42,134
[Goku] WOOHOO!!

39
00:03:43,168 --> 00:03:45,434
[Hakkai] You are a lifesaver.

40
00:03:45,534 --> 00:03:49,168
Oh, don't mention it.
You gentlemen are lucky
my son found you.

41
00:03:49,268 --> 00:03:52,968
This desert is vast. Travelers
do tend to get lost there.

42
00:03:53,068 --> 00:03:56,568
I'm surprised to find a village
all the way out here. Strange.

43
00:03:56,668 --> 00:04:01,534
Well, I'm afraid this
place was not always as
secluded as it is today.

44
00:04:01,634 --> 00:04:04,934
This was a respectable town
until the desert suddenly
expanded a year ago.

45
00:04:07,768 --> 00:04:10,368
Yes, I see.

46
00:04:10,468 --> 00:04:14,601
<i>So the chaos in Shangri-la</i>
<i>is manifesting itself</i>
<i>in other ways too.</i>

47
00:04:17,834 --> 00:04:20,034
[Man] Those clothes...
You're not...

48
00:04:20,134 --> 00:04:22,568
Why, you're not a...
Sanzo Priest?!

49
00:04:24,968 --> 00:04:26,734
I'm sorry, but you
can't stay here!

50
00:04:26,834 --> 00:04:29,701
You must leave immediately!

51
00:04:29,801 --> 00:04:31,934
Boy, take them somewhere else!

52
00:04:32,034 --> 00:04:33,668
Wait! Don't go!

53
00:04:36,334 --> 00:04:39,201
I have a feeling you know
what's going on here.

54
00:04:39,301 --> 00:04:42,501
I don't suppose you could tell
me what this is all about.

55
00:04:44,334 --> 00:04:47,768
About a year ago, when this
area was still a part of town,

56
00:04:47,901 --> 00:04:51,901
a Sanzo Priest came
in from the desert.

57
00:04:52,001 --> 00:04:56,968
Like you, his party was simply
stopping by to get a rest
from their long journey.

58
00:04:57,068 --> 00:05:01,934
As you can imagine, the
town was happy to welcome
as great a monk as him.

59
00:05:02,034 --> 00:05:04,934
But then a demon living in
the desert got wind of it it

60
00:05:05,034 --> 00:05:07,401
and came to eat him up.

61
00:05:07,501 --> 00:05:10,668
Why would a demon come all
that way just to eat a Sanzo?

62
00:05:10,768 --> 00:05:12,834
Are Sanzos that tasty?

63
00:05:12,934 --> 00:05:16,368
Now don't you go getting
any funny ideas, hear me?

64
00:05:18,068 --> 00:05:20,101
[Sanzo] I seem to recall...

65
00:05:20,201 --> 00:05:24,134
The spider woman saying
something about eating
holy monks. Interesting.

66
00:05:24,234 --> 00:05:28,401
Apparently a healthy serving
of monk helps you live longer.

67
00:05:28,501 --> 00:05:31,534
So eating a high ranking
monk like a Sanzo is as

68
00:05:31,634 --> 00:05:37,034
good as eating your fruits
and vegetables when you're
a demon, is that it?

69
00:05:37,134 --> 00:05:37,634
You have got to be shittin' me.

70
00:05:37,734 --> 00:05:39,201
Ha, who knows?

71
00:05:39,301 --> 00:05:42,701
I've never been eaten by a
demon, so I couldn't say.

72
00:05:42,801 --> 00:05:44,568
So, what happened to him?

73
00:05:44,668 --> 00:05:46,601
He got gobbled up.
Just like that.

74
00:05:46,701 --> 00:05:49,268
Just like that? He was a Sanzo?

75
00:05:49,368 --> 00:05:53,901
Being a Sanzo doesn't
necessarily make you
as strong as a demon.

76
00:05:54,001 --> 00:05:59,701
He was probably a proper,
serious, ordinary,
very devout Sanzo.

77
00:05:59,801 --> 00:06:02,068
[Goku & Gojyo] Oh right. Gotcha.

78
00:06:02,168 --> 00:06:04,168
[Sanzo] What do
you mean by that?

79
00:06:04,268 --> 00:06:07,301
Alright. Basically what you're
saying is that if we wait here,

80
00:06:07,401 --> 00:06:11,134
that demon could attack
at any moment, is tha
t what you're telling me?

81
00:06:11,234 --> 00:06:12,701
I'm so sorry.

82
00:06:12,801 --> 00:06:15,768
[Goku] It's not your
fault what demons eat.

83
00:06:15,868 --> 00:06:20,501
[Hakkai] In that case, it
appears that we should get
out of here as soon as possible.

84
00:06:20,601 --> 00:06:23,901
Is something the matter? Sanzo?

85
00:06:24,001 --> 00:06:25,401
[Sanzo] Just thinking.

86
00:06:25,501 --> 00:06:26,568
Hey, kid.

87
00:06:26,668 --> 00:06:30,434
Could you point me to this
desert demon of yours?

88
00:06:30,534 --> 00:06:34,101
Uh, I think I know
the general area.

89
00:06:34,201 --> 00:06:35,701
Good. Show me.

90
00:06:35,801 --> 00:06:37,301
[Goku] What?!
[Gojyo] Hey! Wait a minute!

91
00:06:37,401 --> 00:06:40,468
What do you want to go hunting
some damn demon for anyway?

92
00:06:40,568 --> 00:06:45,601
I mean, it's not like we're
some champions of justice or
anything, are we, Goku?

93
00:06:45,701 --> 00:06:48,568
That's right! Leave him alone!

94
00:06:48,668 --> 00:06:52,001
Am I correct to assume you have
something in mind, Sanzo?

95
00:06:53,468 --> 00:06:54,734
Yeah.

96
00:07:00,934 --> 00:07:03,134
[Ni] Going out, Your Highness?

97
00:07:06,434 --> 00:07:08,834
<i>Just my luck.</i>

98
00:07:08,934 --> 00:07:11,301
Ni Jenyi!

99
00:07:11,401 --> 00:07:12,568
Hello!

100
00:07:12,668 --> 00:07:15,034
[Kougaiji] I don't have time
for your practical jokes.

101
00:07:15,134 --> 00:07:17,234
Now if you'll excuse me.

102
00:07:17,334 --> 00:07:18,834
Off to kill the Sanzo party...

103
00:07:20,734 --> 00:07:22,868
Again?

104
00:07:22,968 --> 00:07:24,801
We heard that one of the
Founding of Heaven and

105
00:07:24,901 --> 00:07:26,968
Earth scriptures is
to the East of here.

106
00:07:27,068 --> 00:07:29,101
If we're planning to
resurrect Gyumaoh,

107
00:07:29,201 --> 00:07:31,801
then we're going to need every
one of those scriptures.

108
00:07:31,901 --> 00:07:35,334
That has to take priority over
killing the Sanzo party.

109
00:07:35,468 --> 00:07:39,334
But don't you worry, once
I get those scriptures
I'll take care of them.

110
00:07:39,434 --> 00:07:43,334
[Ni] And you do all this
for the sake of your poor
mother? How touching.

111
00:07:44,068 --> 00:07:45,368
[Ni imitates crying]

112
00:07:45,468 --> 00:07:47,468
Ah, ignore him, Kou.

113
00:07:47,568 --> 00:07:49,801
[Ni] What's precious to you...

114
00:07:49,901 --> 00:07:53,668
You should never let go of
what's precious to you,

115
00:07:53,768 --> 00:07:55,068
Your Highness.

116
00:07:55,168 --> 00:07:56,868
What're you getting at?

117
00:07:56,968 --> 00:07:58,668
Just a little advice.

118
00:07:58,768 --> 00:08:01,534
And a warning to you.

119
00:08:01,634 --> 00:08:02,934
Now if you'll excuse me.

120
00:08:07,468 --> 00:08:08,834
[Lirin] Kougaiji!

121
00:08:08,934 --> 00:08:12,301
Yaone told me you were
going to take off and
leave me behind again!

122
00:08:12,401 --> 00:08:14,934
It's no fair having
fun without Lirin!

123
00:08:15,034 --> 00:08:18,034
[Yaone] Please forgive me, Lord
Kougaiji, it just slipped out.

124
00:08:18,134 --> 00:08:20,268
Listen to me, Lirin. I
have strict orders from

125
00:08:20,368 --> 00:08:23,568
Gyokumen Koushu herself
not to let you outside
the castle walls.

126
00:08:23,668 --> 00:08:24,868
WHAT?!

127
00:08:24,968 --> 00:08:28,334
But I promise I'll bring you
back something tasty. Okay?

128
00:08:30,901 --> 00:08:34,201
<i>[Ni] You should never let go</i>
<i>of what's precious to you.</i>

129
00:08:35,834 --> 00:08:38,434
<i>[Kougaiji] I don't need</i>
<i>to be told that, Ni.</i>

130
00:08:38,534 --> 00:08:42,701
<i>Taking care of Lirin and</i>
<i>Yaone is what I live for.</i>

131
00:08:42,801 --> 00:08:45,801
<i>Take care of Lirin</i>
<i>for me, Yanone.</i>

132
00:08:45,901 --> 00:08:48,234
Yes, Lord Kougaiji.

133
00:08:50,234 --> 00:08:52,201
[Goku] Are you sure
this is the place?

134
00:08:52,301 --> 00:08:55,734
[Hakkai] That boy said
it was five kilometers
to the north-northeast,

135
00:08:55,834 --> 00:08:57,534
so it should be around
here somewhere.

136
00:08:57,634 --> 00:09:00,001
[Goyjo] He said the demon
that ate the serious Sanzo

137
00:09:00,101 --> 00:09:03,101
has a castle in the
sand too. Pretty cool.

138
00:09:03,201 --> 00:09:05,201
[Goku] Then how're we
supposed to get inside?

139
00:09:05,301 --> 00:09:09,934
Yeah, so Sanzo. What's with
you and this demon anyway, huh?

140
00:09:10,034 --> 00:09:13,701
Each Sanzo is suppose to
guard a Founding of Heaven
and Earth scripture.

141
00:09:13,801 --> 00:09:18,968
If that Sanzo Priest really died
here, then I'm willing to bet
that that scripture is still

142
00:09:19,068 --> 00:09:21,768
hiding around here in
the desert somewhere.

143
00:09:21,868 --> 00:09:26,434
[Hakkai] Of course you realize
that the Gyumaoh team is
after these scriptures.

144
00:09:26,534 --> 00:09:28,968
[Sanzo] Then we better
not waste any time.

145
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:30,201
[Goku] Hm?

146
00:09:30,301 --> 00:09:32,634
What's the matter?

147
00:09:32,734 --> 00:09:34,868
What the hell is this shit?!

148
00:09:35,968 --> 00:09:37,501
Will you cut that out?!

149
00:09:37,601 --> 00:09:40,001
Hey, a little help here! Guys!

150
00:09:40,101 --> 00:09:42,634
[Sanzo] Goku! Gojyo!
[Goku] Sanzo, what's
happening to me?!

151
00:09:42,734 --> 00:09:43,834
It's a trap!

152
00:09:43,934 --> 00:09:45,501
It looks that way!

153
00:09:48,368 --> 00:09:50,634
Goku! Gojyo!

154
00:09:50,734 --> 00:09:51,934
Sanzo!

155
00:09:54,834 --> 00:09:57,668
Cut that out! You'll get
dragged down too! Let go!

156
00:10:02,734 --> 00:10:05,868
[Hakuryu cries in distress]

157
00:10:20,989 --> 00:10:23,330
[Yaone] So this is where
you've been hiding.

158
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:25,130
Lady Gyokumen Koushu's
been looking for you.

159
00:10:26,964 --> 00:10:29,264
[Lirin] Hey, Yaone?
[Yaone] Yes?

160
00:10:29,364 --> 00:10:33,830
I was wondering what kind of
woman was Kougaiji's mother.

161
00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:39,164
She must have been awfully nice,
otherwise Kougaiji wouldn't
love her as much as he does.

162
00:10:39,264 --> 00:10:41,930
My mother seems to hate me,
but...

163
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:46,064
I don't suppose Kougaiji's
mother could ever love
a demon child like me.

164
00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:48,497
Lady Lirin...

165
00:10:52,530 --> 00:10:55,997
Sure she would. Your brother,
Lord Kougaiji and I both love

166
00:10:56,097 --> 00:10:58,797
you, so how could she
not adore you as well?

167
00:11:00,264 --> 00:11:03,797
Well, I love you and
Kougaiji too! A lot!

168
00:11:16,197 --> 00:11:18,364
[Kouryuu] I just can't, Master.

169
00:11:18,464 --> 00:11:20,597
I am grateful you think
so highly of me,

170
00:11:20,697 --> 00:11:24,430
but I'm just not worthy
to be a Sanzo Priest.

171
00:11:24,530 --> 00:11:29,064
[Koumyou] Kouryuu, we have no
set criteria to select a Sanzo.

172
00:11:31,930 --> 00:11:34,997
Watching you these thirteen
years, I have come to believe

173
00:11:35,097 --> 00:11:37,830
that the position of Sanzo
Priest would best be served

174
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:40,097
by your strong body and
even stronger heart.

175
00:11:44,330 --> 00:11:48,064
Just continue being
strong in body and soul,
Priest Genjo Sanzo.

176
00:11:49,797 --> 00:11:53,030
[Kouryuu] That was the last
time I ever saw him smile.

177
00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:54,830
They were his final words to me.

178
00:11:54,930 --> 00:11:56,797
And his final wish.

179
00:11:56,897 --> 00:11:59,364
I have vowed to
never let him down.

180
00:11:59,464 --> 00:12:04,064
Koumyou Sanzo, my
master, my father...

181
00:12:04,197 --> 00:12:07,330
The only Sanzo Priest I
have ever acknowledged.

182
00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:10,830
I have been striving
ever since...

183
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:13,630
[Kouryuu & Sanzo] ...to never
be weak, so that I...

184
00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:16,630
[Sanzo] ...can live up
to the name of Sanzo.

185
00:12:26,864 --> 00:12:28,397
<i>[Sanzo] Where am I?</i>

186
00:12:28,497 --> 00:12:30,030
<i>Oh, right.</i>

187
00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:33,564
<i>We stepped into a sand trap</i>
<i>and fell into a demon's lair.</i>

188
00:12:33,664 --> 00:12:35,197
<i>Figures.</i>

189
00:12:35,297 --> 00:12:39,830
<i>My arm... No, my entire</i>
<i>body is paralyzed.</i>

190
00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:43,430
<i>Must be a black magic</i>
<i>binding spell. Great.</i>

191
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:45,697
<i>[Footsteps approaching]</i>

192
00:12:48,364 --> 00:12:53,597
[Woman] I see we're finally
awake. Don't bother getting up.

193
00:12:53,697 --> 00:12:57,230
Permit me to introduce myself.

194
00:12:57,330 --> 00:13:00,030
I'm the castle mistress, Renli.

195
00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:01,897
How do you do, Priest?

196
00:13:01,997 --> 00:13:04,897
Fine. I feel a little stiff.

197
00:13:04,997 --> 00:13:07,264
I'm sorry to hear that.

198
00:13:07,364 --> 00:13:08,764
[Sanzo] Where are the others?

199
00:13:08,864 --> 00:13:12,830
They're getting to know
our hospitality in
their seperate rooms.

200
00:13:12,930 --> 00:13:14,564
But you ARE a surprise.

201
00:13:14,664 --> 00:13:17,930
Did you know you're the second
Sanzo to drop by here?

202
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:19,764
Did you eat the Sanzo?

203
00:13:19,864 --> 00:13:24,330
He was delicious with a little
teriyaki sauce and some lime.

204
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:27,064
You don't look too
worried. Why not?

205
00:13:27,164 --> 00:13:28,330
No reason.

206
00:13:28,430 --> 00:13:30,964
[Renli] The first Sanzo kept
trembling and chanting all

207
00:13:31,064 --> 00:13:37,164
sorts of sutras. Terribly
unappetizing. I assumed you
were all uptight geezers.

208
00:13:37,264 --> 00:13:40,397
I didn't think they came in
such fresh, pretty packages.

209
00:13:40,497 --> 00:13:41,497
What a dish.

210
00:13:41,597 --> 00:13:43,730
You already obtained
eternal youth,

211
00:13:43,830 --> 00:13:46,430
so what's the point
of eating two Sanzos?

212
00:13:46,530 --> 00:13:49,330
A fine cut of meat just
landed on my plate,

213
00:13:49,430 --> 00:13:51,664
how could I not
have a little taste?

214
00:13:51,764 --> 00:13:54,097
Why did you seek
eternal youth then?

215
00:13:54,197 --> 00:13:57,230
My god, you don't understand
women at all, do you?

216
00:13:57,330 --> 00:14:01,997
What sort of woman wouldn't
want to stay young and
beautiful forever.

217
00:14:02,097 --> 00:14:05,430
[Sanzo] Heh. Don't make
me laugh, you old hag.

218
00:14:05,530 --> 00:14:07,330
What did you say to me?

219
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:11,830
Please tell me you don't think a
little make-up's going to hide
all those wrinkles, grandma.

220
00:14:11,930 --> 00:14:13,630
You make me puke.

221
00:14:13,730 --> 00:14:15,864
[Renli] Take that back!

222
00:14:15,964 --> 00:14:19,330
You don't seem to realize
the situation you're in!

223
00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:21,930
Your life's in my hands now!

224
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:23,597
[Sanzo] Do what you want.

225
00:14:23,697 --> 00:14:28,597
But it sure is a pity
you'll be stuck with for
all eternity with THAT face.

226
00:14:30,030 --> 00:14:34,397
[Goku] Hey! Let us out! Come on!

227
00:14:34,497 --> 00:14:36,397
Did you hear me?!

228
00:14:37,697 --> 00:14:41,064
Will you give it a rest? You're
just wasting your energy.

229
00:14:41,164 --> 00:14:44,197
I doubt they'd let us out
even if they heard you.

230
00:14:44,297 --> 00:14:49,430
Besides, this cell is a little
sturdier than the last one we
had. It's built by demons.

231
00:14:49,530 --> 00:14:51,264
But Sanzo's in big trouble!

232
00:14:51,397 --> 00:14:55,364
He'll be eaten if we don't
find him! We've gotta escape!

233
00:14:55,464 --> 00:14:58,197
Relax. He's not the
type to get eaten.

234
00:14:58,297 --> 00:15:01,697
I doubt they'll bother eating
us, but we probably won't like

235
00:15:01,797 --> 00:15:04,730
whatever they have in store
for us. So we might as well

236
00:15:04,830 --> 00:15:06,330
start thinking about a
way to get out of here.

237
00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:09,864
[Goku] Man, I'm so hungry.

238
00:15:10,797 --> 00:15:12,764
Goku's going to starve to death.

239
00:15:12,864 --> 00:15:15,064
Long before Sanzo
gets eaten, I bet.

240
00:15:17,364 --> 00:15:19,897
[Goku] Hm? What's that sound?

241
00:15:19,997 --> 00:15:22,030
[Gojyo] The hunger's making
you hallucinate already?

242
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:25,130
[Goku] It sounds like paper
rustling or something.

243
00:15:28,464 --> 00:15:29,964
[Goku] Scorpion!

244
00:15:30,897 --> 00:15:32,430
God, I hate these.

245
00:15:32,530 --> 00:15:36,164
This is a desert. I guess
you should expect to see
the occasional scorpion.

246
00:15:36,264 --> 00:15:39,564
Maybe one or two of these
critters, I can understand.

247
00:15:42,964 --> 00:15:45,397
[Gojyo] But this can't
be natural, can it?

248
00:15:51,530 --> 00:15:54,664
Ha! You're way too full
of yourself, meathead!

249
00:15:56,530 --> 00:16:00,830
[Koumyou] Just continue
being strong in body and
soul, Priest Genjo Sanzo.

250
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:05,230
<i>[Sanzo] Master, I will try...</i>

251
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:08,964
[Renli] I don't like
the way you look at me.

252
00:16:09,064 --> 00:16:11,364
So what if you are a Sanzo?

253
00:16:11,464 --> 00:16:15,864
In the end, you're just a weak
human who chants silly sutras!

254
00:16:15,964 --> 00:16:17,430
Maybe I am.

255
00:16:19,164 --> 00:16:20,864
[Kouryuu] I couldn't
protect him.

256
00:16:22,397 --> 00:16:24,097
You're nothing but beefsteak!

257
00:16:27,964 --> 00:16:30,897
Wha- You're not paralyzed?!

258
00:16:30,997 --> 00:16:34,197
[Sanzo] Slapping me around
like that broke me out of
the black magic trance.

259
00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:39,197
You're right. Maybe we are
nothing more than humans.

260
00:16:39,297 --> 00:16:42,197
But that's why we're
capable of killing people.

261
00:16:42,297 --> 00:16:46,397
Much less measly demons
like yourself.

262
00:16:46,497 --> 00:16:51,130
[Goku] Take that! And that!
And that! And that! And that!

263
00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:52,430
[Gojyo] Any suggestions?

264
00:16:52,530 --> 00:16:53,830
[Goku] We have to break
through those walls!

265
00:17:00,830 --> 00:17:02,064
Just our luck.

266
00:17:02,164 --> 00:17:05,964
Hakkai, stop standing around
and give us a hand, will ya?!

267
00:17:06,064 --> 00:17:08,530
If you say so.

268
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:11,964
[Hakkai] This is the wall
we have to go through if
we want to escape.

269
00:17:12,064 --> 00:17:14,564
Oh, just hurry up
and knock it down!

270
00:17:14,664 --> 00:17:18,497
Uuuh, I don't know. I think it
would be better if we didn't.

271
00:17:18,597 --> 00:17:21,330
[Gojyo] Anything's better
than getting stung to death!

272
00:17:21,430 --> 00:17:23,064
[Goku] Hakkai, hurry!

273
00:17:23,164 --> 00:17:26,430
If you say so. Break!

274
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:29,697
[Goku] Nice job!

275
00:17:29,797 --> 00:17:31,230
[Gojyo] Uh, let's
get out of here!

276
00:17:35,130 --> 00:17:37,164
What's the hold up?
Let's get moving!

277
00:17:37,264 --> 00:17:38,130
Move your ass!

278
00:17:38,264 --> 00:17:39,997
[Hakkai] Yeah! Right.

279
00:17:45,271 --> 00:17:48,031
[Renli] You're going to kill me?

280
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:51,932
I already ate a Sanzo,
so I'm immortal now.

281
00:17:51,932 --> 00:17:53,332
Or have you forgotten?

282
00:17:53,432 --> 00:17:54,598
[Sanzo] How ludicrous.

283
00:17:54,698 --> 00:17:56,798
Don't tell me you actually
believe that old wives tale?

284
00:17:56,898 --> 00:17:58,332
What tale?!

285
00:17:58,432 --> 00:17:59,598
Do you seriously believe

286
00:17:59,698 --> 00:18:02,498
that you can become immortal
simply by eating a human?

287
00:18:03,632 --> 00:18:06,532
What proof do you have that
you're immortal now?

288
00:18:08,765 --> 00:18:10,698
Shall we test it?

289
00:18:11,398 --> 00:18:12,532
[Renli] No, please!

290
00:18:14,798 --> 00:18:16,365
Why you...

291
00:18:16,465 --> 00:18:21,565
[Sanzo] Well well well.
It looks like you can still
feel pain as an immortal.

292
00:18:21,665 --> 00:18:25,765
I bet it will hurt a lot more
with a bullet in your skull.

293
00:18:28,965 --> 00:18:33,532
<i>[Sanzo] This is stupid.</i>
<i>This is so stupid!</i>

294
00:18:33,632 --> 00:18:36,265
Hey! What're you doing, Sanzo?!

295
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:40,332
[Gojyo] I don't think I've
ever seen you so... brutal.
It's not like you.

296
00:18:40,432 --> 00:18:41,898
It's not like me, eh?

297
00:18:41,998 --> 00:18:43,932
Then what exactly am I like?

298
00:18:44,832 --> 00:18:47,532
Sanzo...

299
00:18:47,632 --> 00:18:49,232
Goku!

300
00:18:52,165 --> 00:18:55,098
[Sanzo] Ow! That hurt!
What'd you do that for?!

301
00:18:55,198 --> 00:18:56,665
Berate me.

302
00:18:56,765 --> 00:18:59,832
Go ahead and strike me with
your little paper fan.

303
00:18:59,932 --> 00:19:03,065
That's what the Sanzo
Priest I know would do.

304
00:19:06,898 --> 00:19:09,832
<i>[Hakkai] Sanzo's rage</i>
<i>vanished instantly.</i>

305
00:19:09,932 --> 00:19:13,232
<i>The Sanzo Priest was really no</i>
<i>match for the monkey's wit.</i>

306
00:19:14,965 --> 00:19:17,632
Hey, there's something
I want you to tell me.

307
00:19:17,732 --> 00:19:20,198
You know those holy scriptures
you were talking about?

308
00:19:20,298 --> 00:19:23,498
The ones that me and the other
Sanzo priest were wearing?

309
00:19:23,598 --> 00:19:25,065
Where are they now?

310
00:19:25,165 --> 00:19:26,565
Scriptures?

311
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:29,732
You might... you might be able
to find the first scripture

312
00:19:29,832 --> 00:19:33,532
laying around here
in the castle somewhere
if you look long enough.

313
00:19:33,632 --> 00:19:35,932
Yours is on the
shelf behind you.

314
00:19:40,365 --> 00:19:41,965
Watch out! Sanzo!

315
00:19:46,898 --> 00:19:48,465
Sanzo, nooo!

316
00:19:50,065 --> 00:19:52,032
[Gojyo] Quick! Close
his wound, Hakkai!

317
00:19:53,032 --> 00:19:55,065
I'm already on it!

318
00:19:55,732 --> 00:19:56,698
No...

319
00:19:56,798 --> 00:20:00,298
My nails possess the
deadly scorpion venom!

320
00:20:00,398 --> 00:20:02,732
Say your final farewells.

321
00:20:06,165 --> 00:20:07,498
Damn bitch!

322
00:20:09,098 --> 00:20:11,232
You are gonna pay!

323
00:20:14,032 --> 00:20:16,265
[Dokugaku] Goddamn, it's hot!

324
00:20:16,365 --> 00:20:19,198
Now this is odd. The castle
where that demon is keeping

325
00:20:19,298 --> 00:20:22,298
one of the Foundation scriptures
should be right here.

326
00:20:22,398 --> 00:20:25,365
[Dokugaku] Huh?
[Kougaiji] What's
wrong? Dokugakuji?

327
00:20:25,465 --> 00:20:27,898
I think I spotted something
here in the sand.

328
00:20:32,332 --> 00:20:34,365
[Dokugaku] You better come
take a look at this.

329
00:20:44,832 --> 00:20:46,765
Hey, wait a sec.

330
00:20:46,865 --> 00:20:48,832
It's not fair taking back moves.

331
00:22:28,998 --> 00:22:31,219
[Goku] I wanna save Sanzo,

332
00:22:31,219 --> 00:22:33,279
and I'm willing to
do whatever it takes!

333
00:22:33,279 --> 00:22:36,745
But it doesn't look
like I can beat Kougaiji
in my present form.

334
00:22:36,845 --> 00:22:43,045
Okay, so Hakkai, Gojyo, once I
get started you have to find a
way to make me stop, you got it?

335
00:22:43,145 --> 00:22:44,612
I'm counting on you guys!

336
00:22:44,712 --> 00:22:47,979
Because I'm going to be
"Berserking Towards Destruction"

337
00:22:48,079 --> 00:22:50,412
Next time on Saiyuki!
