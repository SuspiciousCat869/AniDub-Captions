1
00:02:09,687 --> 00:02:12,554
[Goku] "The Fall
of Houtou Castle."

2
00:02:53,949 --> 00:02:55,083
You ready?

3
00:02:55,183 --> 00:02:56,949
Yeah.

4
00:02:57,049 --> 00:02:59,749
What's wrong? What's
going on here?

5
00:02:59,849 --> 00:03:01,649
[Attendants] Lady Koushu!

6
00:03:01,749 --> 00:03:04,683
[Koushu] Tell me. What's
causing that alarm?

7
00:03:04,783 --> 00:03:06,483
[Attendant 1] You must
leave! There's no time!

8
00:03:06,583 --> 00:03:07,783
[Attendant 2] We're
under attack!

9
00:03:07,883 --> 00:03:09,649
What... What did you say?!

10
00:03:11,416 --> 00:03:15,183
[Captain] Halt! You're
completely surrounded!

11
00:03:15,283 --> 00:03:17,416
Who the hell are you and
how did you get in here?

12
00:03:18,316 --> 00:03:19,683
Answer me.

13
00:03:19,783 --> 00:03:21,383
I said answer me!

14
00:03:21,483 --> 00:03:23,349
Why? What's the matter?

15
00:03:26,649 --> 00:03:28,383
Isn't it obvious?

16
00:03:29,983 --> 00:03:31,583
We are your gods!

17
00:03:45,783 --> 00:03:47,716
<i>[Kougaiji] Careless.</i>

18
00:03:47,816 --> 00:03:51,749
<i>I should have been prepared</i>
<i>for a late-night raid.</i>

19
00:03:51,849 --> 00:03:56,183
[Yaone] Lord Kougaiji, I have
gathered our forces in Block
Three for a counterattack.

20
00:03:56,283 --> 00:03:59,883
[Kougaiji] Good! We'll ambush
these intruders there.

21
00:03:59,983 --> 00:04:01,483
[Yaone] Aye.

22
00:04:01,583 --> 00:04:04,683
Kougaiji! They've wiped
out the security detail!

23
00:04:04,783 --> 00:04:05,549
Wiped out?!

24
00:04:05,649 --> 00:04:06,383
I just heard.

25
00:04:06,483 --> 00:04:07,983
All of them destroyed!

26
00:04:08,083 --> 00:04:10,449
That's impossible!
Are you sure?!

27
00:04:10,549 --> 00:04:11,849
I'm sure.

28
00:04:11,949 --> 00:04:15,816
<i>[Kougaiji] Who could destroy</i>
<i>an entire detail so fast?</i>

29
00:04:15,916 --> 00:04:17,983
[Dokugakuji] According to
the few who managed to escape,

30
00:04:18,083 --> 00:04:20,716
the intruders all bore
chakras on their foreheads,

31
00:04:20,816 --> 00:04:22,783
and boasted about being gods.

32
00:04:24,683 --> 00:04:30,149
<i>[Kougaiji] Chakras, huh? So</i>
<i>if they aren't gods, they're</i>
<i>close enough to worry about.</i>

33
00:04:30,249 --> 00:04:33,316
<i>But what would the gods</i>
<i>want with Houtou Castle?</i>

34
00:04:33,416 --> 00:04:37,949
Ha! Bring them on!
They'll be dead meat
once I get ahold of them!

35
00:04:38,049 --> 00:04:38,849
Yaone!

36
00:04:38,949 --> 00:04:39,949
Yes, sir?

37
00:04:40,049 --> 00:04:41,183
Will you watch over her?

38
00:04:41,283 --> 00:04:42,483
Yes, of course.

39
00:04:42,583 --> 00:04:44,316
But I wanna fight.

40
00:04:44,416 --> 00:04:46,083
[Kougaiji] Do as I say, Lirin!

41
00:04:54,449 --> 00:04:56,083
Let's go, Dokugakuji.

42
00:04:59,749 --> 00:05:01,816
No! Don't leave!

43
00:05:05,383 --> 00:05:09,049
Homura, I believe the Gyumaoh
can be found in the basement.

44
00:05:09,149 --> 00:05:11,116
Then the Scripture
should be there.

45
00:05:11,216 --> 00:05:12,983
Yep. No doubt about it.

46
00:05:13,583 --> 00:05:15,216
What's the plan?

47
00:05:17,849 --> 00:05:21,016
[Homura] I'm going down
below. As for you guys...

48
00:05:21,116 --> 00:05:22,649
[Zenon] I hear ya.

49
00:05:22,749 --> 00:05:26,116
We get to have some
target practice until
you get back, right?

50
00:05:27,049 --> 00:05:28,849
You guys have fun now.

51
00:05:29,883 --> 00:05:31,283
I won't be long.

52
00:05:31,383 --> 00:05:33,349
Take your time.

53
00:05:33,449 --> 00:05:35,816
[Shien] Homura?
[Homura] Yes?

54
00:05:35,916 --> 00:05:37,516
Please be careful.

55
00:05:37,616 --> 00:05:38,783
Right.

56
00:05:38,883 --> 00:05:40,183
[Gunshots and men yelling]

57
00:05:41,749 --> 00:05:44,783
[Explosions in the distance]

58
00:05:44,883 --> 00:05:46,049
Sure is loud.

59
00:05:46,149 --> 00:05:47,516
Isn't it?

60
00:05:47,616 --> 00:05:48,749
[Huang] Dr. Ni!

61
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:50,516
We are under attack!

62
00:05:50,616 --> 00:05:53,383
We all have to get out
of here immediately!

63
00:05:53,483 --> 00:05:56,283
Now what's got your
panties in a wad?

64
00:05:56,383 --> 00:05:57,783
Can't you hear all that racket?

65
00:05:57,883 --> 00:06:01,516
The enemy is approaching!
We are under attack, Doctor!

66
00:06:02,749 --> 00:06:06,216
[Ni] What enemy is
that? I have so many.

67
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:08,183
Are you insane?!

68
00:06:08,283 --> 00:06:13,316
As far as I'm concerned,
everyone is my enemy
except for me,

69
00:06:13,416 --> 00:06:16,583
the Sanzo Party, and his
holy, royal highness.

70
00:06:16,683 --> 00:06:19,516
And especially you, Miss Huang.

71
00:06:19,616 --> 00:06:21,783
What makes you think
that I am your enemy?!

72
00:06:21,883 --> 00:06:24,849
We're both in love with
Lady Koushu, aren't we?

73
00:06:24,949 --> 00:06:26,349
[Huang] What?!
[Ni] Do you deny it?

74
00:06:26,449 --> 00:06:28,049
Are you nuts?!

75
00:06:28,149 --> 00:06:31,016
This isn't the time or
place for this nonsense!

76
00:06:31,116 --> 00:06:36,516
It's precisely times like
these that we should be
aware of our biases.

77
00:06:37,883 --> 00:06:40,249
Well, then, I guess
I'll be leaving now.

78
00:06:41,149 --> 00:06:42,649
[Wang] Where are you going?

79
00:06:44,849 --> 00:06:47,416
[Ni] To work as hard
as I'm paid to.

80
00:06:51,616 --> 00:06:54,983
Doctor! The evacuation
block is the other way!

81
00:06:55,083 --> 00:06:58,549
[Ni] I know, Miss Huang. I know.

82
00:07:01,716 --> 00:07:02,716
Damn thing.

83
00:07:02,816 --> 00:07:04,016
[Dokugakuji] Kougaiji!

84
00:07:04,116 --> 00:07:06,016
The invaders have just
split up into groups.

85
00:07:06,116 --> 00:07:09,549
I'm afraid some of them are
making their way to the
basement right now.

86
00:07:09,649 --> 00:07:11,049
Then it is true.

87
00:07:11,149 --> 00:07:12,183
What is?

88
00:07:12,283 --> 00:07:14,649
If these guys truly are gods,

89
00:07:14,749 --> 00:07:18,116
then they can only
be after one thing.

90
00:07:18,216 --> 00:07:19,483
What is that?

91
00:07:19,583 --> 00:07:22,349
My father! Now let's
get out of here!

92
00:07:22,449 --> 00:07:23,849
[Dokugakuji] Right!

93
00:07:23,949 --> 00:07:25,649
[Homura] The lowest level.

94
00:07:25,749 --> 00:07:29,983
Where the very gates of
Hell shall soon be opened.

95
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:35,916
Son Goku, not even you have
known the pains of that place.

96
00:07:36,016 --> 00:07:40,916
So watch closely, my
friend. Learn well.

97
00:07:41,016 --> 00:07:44,649
I am doing this partly
for you, after all.

98
00:07:57,949 --> 00:08:00,383
I don't see the
she-fox anywhere.

99
00:08:00,483 --> 00:08:02,983
Crazy bitch must have escaped
when she had the chance.

100
00:08:03,083 --> 00:08:06,283
Yeah, well. I can't
say I'm surprised.

101
00:08:06,383 --> 00:08:09,349
<i>[Kougaiji] But I... never</i>
<i>expected she'd take the</i>

102
00:08:09,449 --> 00:08:12,516
<i>Seiten Scripture and</i>
<i>leave my father behind.</i>

103
00:08:12,616 --> 00:08:14,683
Kou, we have to do something.

104
00:08:14,783 --> 00:08:19,449
We will later. But the first
thing you and I have to do is
take care of those intruders.

105
00:08:20,383 --> 00:08:22,583
And this is where
they're headed.

106
00:08:25,616 --> 00:08:27,216
[Attendant 1] This way,
Lady Koushu!

107
00:08:27,316 --> 00:08:28,716
[Koushu] Alright.

108
00:08:30,416 --> 00:08:32,816
<i>This is unbelievable.</i>

109
00:08:32,916 --> 00:08:34,483
<i>Of all the things</i>
<i>that could go wrong,</i>

110
00:08:34,583 --> 00:08:37,483
<i>I never expected an</i>
<i>attack from heaven.</i>

111
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:39,749
<i>Talk about out of left field.</i>

112
00:08:51,616 --> 00:08:57,149
[Shien] To think, this
is where Nataku imprisoned
Gyumaoh five hundred years ago.

113
00:08:57,249 --> 00:09:03,483
As I recall, the castle's
defenses were not as
pathetic back then.

114
00:09:03,583 --> 00:09:07,549
[Zenon] All their
energy has been devoted
to resurrecting Gyumaoh.

115
00:09:07,649 --> 00:09:11,049
Bet they wish that
rethought that strategy.

116
00:09:11,149 --> 00:09:14,816
Regardless, they couldn't have
attacked us head on like this.

117
00:09:14,916 --> 00:09:16,783
I expected more from them.

118
00:09:16,883 --> 00:09:18,149
[Zenon] They can't help it.

119
00:09:18,249 --> 00:09:22,049
The surprise attack rattled
their common sense.

120
00:09:28,316 --> 00:09:29,949
Impossible!

121
00:09:34,516 --> 00:09:36,116
[Kougaiji] It took
you long enough.

122
00:09:36,216 --> 00:09:38,116
Awful slow, for a god.

123
00:09:39,549 --> 00:09:41,683
You must be Gyumaoh's kid.

124
00:09:41,783 --> 00:09:43,616
My name is Kougaiji.

125
00:09:43,716 --> 00:09:47,716
And I am the swordsman sworn
into his service. And you are?

126
00:09:47,816 --> 00:09:50,149
I am the Prince of War.

127
00:09:50,249 --> 00:09:51,549
The Prince of War?

128
00:09:51,649 --> 00:09:54,349
I am the successor to
War Prince Nataku,

129
00:09:54,449 --> 00:09:56,749
who once subjugated your father.

130
00:09:56,849 --> 00:10:01,516
So, I was right. This invasion
has all been about my father.

131
00:10:01,616 --> 00:10:04,516
The Heavens certainly are
growing impatient, aren't they?

132
00:10:04,616 --> 00:10:07,649
You can't even wait
until he's been awakened.

133
00:10:07,749 --> 00:10:11,783
I could care less if your father
will be resurrected or not.

134
00:10:11,883 --> 00:10:14,883
I'm only after the
Seiten Scripture.

135
00:10:14,983 --> 00:10:16,249
What?!

136
00:10:16,349 --> 00:10:17,783
[Homura] But I
don't see it here.

137
00:10:17,883 --> 00:10:20,516
It must be hidden
away somewhere.

138
00:10:21,616 --> 00:10:23,249
A secret passageway.

139
00:10:27,683 --> 00:10:30,616
Hold it right there, cape
boy. That's far enough.

140
00:10:31,316 --> 00:10:32,983
You're in my way.

141
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:39,349
[Homura] You lack skill.
[Dokugakuji] Oh yeah?!

142
00:10:39,449 --> 00:10:42,049
That's not the way you
handle a sword, demon.

143
00:10:47,916 --> 00:10:49,583
[Kougaiji] Dokugakuji!

144
00:10:51,849 --> 00:10:54,183
[Homura] That's how
you handle a sword.

145
00:10:54,316 --> 00:10:56,583
Sorry, but I won't...

146
00:10:56,683 --> 00:10:58,816
let anyone stand in my way.

147
00:11:13,507 --> 00:11:14,340
[Sanzo] Who are you?!

148
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,307
Don't look so surprised, Konzen.

149
00:11:16,407 --> 00:11:19,540
Oh, I'm sorry. I mean
Genjo Sanzo, of course.

150
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:21,640
I asked you who you were.

151
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:23,140
A goddess.

152
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,940
Please, not another one.

153
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:27,573
Step outside. You
and I need to talk.

154
00:11:27,673 --> 00:11:29,707
Huh, I'm not going anywhere-

155
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:37,507
You know it's virtually
impossible to resist me,
don't you, Genjo Sanzo?

156
00:11:37,607 --> 00:11:38,840
A bodhisattva?

157
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:39,840
That's me.

158
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:41,973
Not so irresistible.

159
00:11:42,073 --> 00:11:43,807
There's no need
to get so hostile.

160
00:11:43,907 --> 00:11:47,207
After all, we shared
a kiss once, remember?

161
00:11:47,307 --> 00:11:50,873
You'll need a bigger gun
than that to impress me.

162
00:11:50,973 --> 00:11:55,040
[Sanzo] I've had just
about enough of following
your stupid orders.

163
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:58,840
[Goddess] You think
preventing the revival
of Gyumaoh is stupid?

164
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:04,873
It was you. You who made me
take Gojyo, Hakkai and Goku
on this trek, didn't you?

165
00:12:04,973 --> 00:12:07,740
You bet. Aren't
they so much fun?

166
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,407
[Sanzo] They're a
pain in the ass.

167
00:12:09,507 --> 00:12:11,940
I could have finished this
task without them by now.

168
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:13,573
[Goddess] I suppose that's true.

169
00:12:13,673 --> 00:12:18,773
But you see, I've loved
the four of you for
such a long, long time.

170
00:12:18,873 --> 00:12:21,140
I couldn't leave anyone behind.

171
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,507
Die, you damn hag!

172
00:12:26,773 --> 00:12:29,373
You haven't changed
a bit, have you?

173
00:12:34,873 --> 00:12:37,740
[Homura] Well, you are
fast, I'll give you that.

174
00:12:43,607 --> 00:12:46,340
Say your prayers, Prince of War!

175
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:50,440
Eye of flame, pillar of light,
I call you here from the
netherworld to do my bidding.

176
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:52,673
[Repeats the chant]

177
00:12:53,873 --> 00:12:56,140
Cute. Summoning a fiend.

178
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,007
You may be some
fun after all, boy.

179
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:02,307
Come and grant me
the power of fire!

180
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:19,340
Hmph. This is your best?

181
00:13:21,173 --> 00:13:23,340
<i>[Kougaiji] That sword has</i>
<i>the power to part fire?!</i>

182
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:27,773
You're not too bad. But you've
still got a long way to go, kid.

183
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:43,440
<i>[Kougaiji] Oh shit...</i>

184
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:45,840
<i>The fiend didn't even slow him.</i>

185
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:53,507
[Homura] You need to learn.
There is no such thing as
absolute good or absolute evil.

186
00:13:53,607 --> 00:13:57,640
There is only power.
Power rules the heavens,

187
00:13:57,740 --> 00:14:01,707
just as the powerful
rule in the Lower World.

188
00:14:01,807 --> 00:14:02,773
You shut up!

189
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:10,307
[Dokugakuji] Kou!

190
00:14:10,407 --> 00:14:13,073
D-Dokugakuji, you're alive?

191
00:14:13,173 --> 00:14:14,807
Yeah, just barely.

192
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:17,040
Looks like he beat us.

193
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:19,840
Yeah, I've got a huge debt now.

194
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:22,373
I'll pay him back with interest.

195
00:14:25,907 --> 00:14:28,073
So this is where you've
been hiding, huh?

196
00:14:28,173 --> 00:14:30,740
[Souei] Long time no see, Zenon.

197
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:32,007
[Zenon] Souei.

198
00:14:32,107 --> 00:14:38,340
Yes, the same demon child
who once worked under you.

199
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:42,740
[Voice] Zenon, this is the
Jade Emperor's decree.

200
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:49,040
having sired a bastard child,
you are hereby banished
to the Lower World.

201
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:53,773
If you can fraternize with
humans, then you can
live among them.

202
00:14:53,873 --> 00:14:57,840
[Zenon] Fine by me.
I was growing bored
of this place anyway.

203
00:14:57,940 --> 00:15:00,973
Living a lazy life with a wife
and kids on Earth may be just-

204
00:15:04,973 --> 00:15:06,607
Mirei!

205
00:15:09,707 --> 00:15:11,473
You bastard!

206
00:15:11,573 --> 00:15:13,940
[Souei] Here's your
lovely wife back.

207
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:16,540
A fighter to the very end.

208
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:18,973
It's her fault for
not listening to me!

209
00:15:19,073 --> 00:15:21,207
You will pay for
what you have done!

210
00:15:21,307 --> 00:15:23,973
You would never
kill me, would you?

211
00:15:24,073 --> 00:15:27,173
Gods are forbidden
to take a life.

212
00:15:27,273 --> 00:15:28,407
[Zenon] Bastard!

213
00:15:28,507 --> 00:15:29,540
An illusion?!

214
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:31,640
[Souei chuckles amusedly]

215
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:35,407
[Souei] Kind of hard to
catch me when I'm not
even here, isn't it?

216
00:15:35,507 --> 00:15:38,240
I wish you the best,
Zenon. Farewell.

217
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:41,773
I was wondering where you
had run off to, Souei.

218
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:46,840
It looks to me as though you've
taken a liking to killing.

219
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:51,507
You wouldn't be after my
old job now, or are you
through with the god gig?

220
00:15:51,607 --> 00:15:54,607
First you decide to take
a human wife and now,

221
00:15:54,707 --> 00:15:59,107
as if that wasn't sacrilegious
enough, you've taken
to killing people.

222
00:15:59,207 --> 00:16:01,440
That's quite a fall from grace.

223
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:05,707
Afraid not. My problem
is with the management.

224
00:16:05,807 --> 00:16:08,807
But things will change
once we're in charge!

225
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:14,207
Don't tell me you plan to
overthrow the Heavens?

226
00:16:14,307 --> 00:16:16,807
Sure, I guess you
could say that.

227
00:16:16,907 --> 00:16:21,907
[Souei] You guys in charge of
heaven. That, I'd like to see.

228
00:16:22,007 --> 00:16:25,607
Explains why you're after
the Seiten Scripture.

229
00:16:25,707 --> 00:16:27,873
[Zenon] As perceptive as always.

230
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:31,107
Now let me guess...

231
00:16:31,207 --> 00:16:34,040
Your body is really
your shadow, right?

232
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:36,540
Well, this time you will die!

233
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:40,540
No, please. Don't do it.
I want to serve you again!

234
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:42,907
[Zenon] Save your regrets
for the next world!

235
00:16:46,007 --> 00:16:51,807
My only regret is having
made you my servant.

236
00:16:53,307 --> 00:16:54,573
So it's over?

237
00:16:54,673 --> 00:16:56,940
Nah, it's just the beginning.

238
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:00,273
[Soldier] Lord Shien, we
have control of the castle.

239
00:17:00,407 --> 00:17:03,407
Then there is only
one thing left...

240
00:17:03,507 --> 00:17:05,440
[Zenon] Aah, yes. That.

241
00:17:12,021 --> 00:17:13,654
[Attendant 1] I think
we got away.

242
00:17:13,754 --> 00:17:16,621
[Attendant 2] You'll be
clear, once we get you
to a flying dragon.

243
00:17:24,188 --> 00:17:25,154
[Sanzo] So?

244
00:17:25,254 --> 00:17:27,188
Tell me what you want, lady.

245
00:17:27,288 --> 00:17:30,621
I thought I'd remind
you of something.

246
00:17:30,721 --> 00:17:32,388
[Sanzo] What's that?

247
00:17:32,488 --> 00:17:37,921
The one important lesson
your master, Koumyou Sanzo,
passed down to you.

248
00:17:38,021 --> 00:17:40,254
To hold nothing.

249
00:17:40,354 --> 00:17:42,921
[Sanzo] "If you meet the
Buddha, kill the Buddha.

250
00:17:43,021 --> 00:17:45,688
If you meet your father,
kill your father.

251
00:17:45,788 --> 00:17:48,121
Free of everything, you
are bound by nothing.

252
00:17:48,221 --> 00:17:51,188
Live the life that
is given to you."

253
00:17:51,288 --> 00:17:52,854
I could never forget
those words.

254
00:17:52,954 --> 00:17:54,554
Is that so?

255
00:17:54,654 --> 00:17:57,221
Then I'm proud of you.

256
00:17:57,321 --> 00:18:01,154
The road you travel upon
will only become more
treacherous as you go.

257
00:18:01,254 --> 00:18:04,321
And believe me, the time will
come when only that teaching

258
00:18:04,421 --> 00:18:07,254
will provide you with the
hope you need to carry on.

259
00:18:07,354 --> 00:18:10,788
Never forget.

260
00:18:10,888 --> 00:18:12,421
Don't disappoint me.

261
00:18:12,521 --> 00:18:16,354
Watching you four boys is
the only entertainment I
can count on these days.

262
00:18:20,788 --> 00:18:23,321
Lady Gyokumen Koushu,
you must flee!

263
00:18:23,421 --> 00:18:25,521
We'll take care of this, madam.

264
00:18:25,621 --> 00:18:26,521
[Ni] Oh, enough already.

265
00:18:29,388 --> 00:18:31,921
Don't you know a god
when you see one?

266
00:18:32,021 --> 00:18:34,521
You wouldn't stand a
chance against him.

267
00:18:34,621 --> 00:18:36,821
[Koushu] Ni.
[Ni] Lady Koushu,

268
00:18:36,921 --> 00:18:40,588
[Ni] I would advise you to
hand over the Seiten Scripture.

269
00:18:40,688 --> 00:18:43,821
Why make this any more
difficult for yourselves?

270
00:18:43,954 --> 00:18:48,588
He may be merciful on
us and let us escape
with our lives, perhaps.

271
00:18:48,688 --> 00:18:53,854
Hmph. That's fine so long
as I walk out of here with
the Seiten Scripture.

272
00:18:53,954 --> 00:18:56,288
Give me one good reason why
I should believe that crap.

273
00:18:56,388 --> 00:19:00,521
It doesn't matter what
YOU believe, he has our
lives in his hands.

274
00:19:00,621 --> 00:19:04,754
We have no choice. Besides, they
say all believers are saved.

275
00:19:04,854 --> 00:19:06,254
Huh?

276
00:19:06,354 --> 00:19:10,954
[Ni] And it is also said
that tomorrow brings
its own fortunes.

277
00:19:11,054 --> 00:19:13,954
Do you have a reason
to live, Doctor?

278
00:19:15,221 --> 00:19:17,054
Several.

279
00:19:17,188 --> 00:19:22,321
[Homura] Then what fortune does
tomorrow bring that makes your
life so worth saving?

280
00:19:22,421 --> 00:19:25,154
[Ni] Come to think of it,
there probably isn't any.

281
00:19:29,821 --> 00:19:33,821
Ni, can you explain
yourself to me?

282
00:19:33,921 --> 00:19:39,988
Oh, please, it was all
I could do to save your
precious life, Lady Koushu.

283
00:19:40,088 --> 00:19:42,788
After all, I work as
hard as I'm paid to.

284
00:19:50,221 --> 00:19:52,254
Ah, what a morning!

285
00:19:52,354 --> 00:19:53,454
You think so?

286
00:19:53,554 --> 00:19:55,021
Ooh, there you are.

287
00:19:55,121 --> 00:19:58,288
I was wondering where
you crashed out.

288
00:19:58,388 --> 00:20:00,521
Was it so we couldn't
hear you snoring?!

289
00:20:00,621 --> 00:20:02,288
Lay down and... shut up!

290
00:20:02,388 --> 00:20:06,588
Well, looks like Sanzo sure
does need some anger management.

291
00:20:06,688 --> 00:20:10,221
If you don't move your ass,
I'll show you anger management.

292
00:20:10,321 --> 00:20:13,088
But we haven't had
breakfast yet.

293
00:20:13,188 --> 00:20:15,788
[Sanzo] We don't have
time! Now MOVE!

294
00:20:15,888 --> 00:20:16,754
Yes, Sir.

295
00:20:16,854 --> 00:20:18,688
You're sure in a bad mood.

296
00:20:18,788 --> 00:20:20,221
What's your problem?

297
00:20:21,421 --> 00:20:23,588
[Sanzo] I just had
a rude awakening.

298
00:20:29,388 --> 00:20:30,888
[Homura] Are you sure?

299
00:20:30,988 --> 00:20:34,754
You've already done everything
you planned to do in
the Lower Worlds.

300
00:20:34,854 --> 00:20:38,388
That may be, but we're
only just beginning.

301
00:20:38,488 --> 00:20:41,388
I want to see this
through to the end.

302
00:20:43,621 --> 00:20:47,821
[Homura] Then it's time to
obtain Konzen's Maten Scripture.
