1
00:01:37,421 --> 00:01:39,002
[Goddess] Eternity is
so unbearably boring.

2
00:01:39,002 --> 00:01:40,136
Don't you think?

3
00:01:40,869 --> 00:01:43,336
Nothing ever changes.

4
00:01:43,436 --> 00:01:46,202
Five hundred years ago,
everyone shone the brightest.

5
00:01:46,302 --> 00:01:48,069
And you were brilliant.

6
00:01:49,302 --> 00:01:50,702
And Konzen too.

7
00:01:51,769 --> 00:01:54,002
Yes, Konzen.

8
00:01:57,636 --> 00:01:59,402
[Goku] "The Furious Sun."

9
00:02:03,402 --> 00:02:06,869
[Goku] Let go! You're
hurting me! Stop it!

10
00:02:06,969 --> 00:02:10,569
You said you'd give me
something to eat! Damn liar.

11
00:02:15,136 --> 00:02:18,269
[Goku] Wow...

12
00:02:18,369 --> 00:02:19,102
[Konzen] What is it?

13
00:02:19,202 --> 00:02:20,669
Your hair...

14
00:02:20,769 --> 00:02:22,669
It looks just like the sun!

15
00:02:23,169 --> 00:02:24,669
The sun?

16
00:02:24,769 --> 00:02:26,569
Please forgive his
transgression, my lord!

17
00:02:26,669 --> 00:02:28,502
He doesn't know what he's doing!

18
00:02:28,602 --> 00:02:30,169
[Pulling and ripping sounds]

19
00:02:33,536 --> 00:02:34,669
I'm sorry.

20
00:02:39,002 --> 00:02:41,469
What the hell did you do that
for, you damn monkey?!

21
00:02:41,569 --> 00:02:42,569
[Konzen] Don't you
know who I am?!
[Goku] I didn't mean it!

22
00:02:42,669 --> 00:02:44,269
[Goku] I said I was sorry!

23
00:02:44,369 --> 00:02:47,769
Oh no! This is so embarassing!

24
00:02:47,869 --> 00:02:49,336
[Goddess] Egan.
[Egan] Huh?

25
00:02:49,436 --> 00:02:50,469
He's so charming.

26
00:02:50,569 --> 00:02:52,936
And they get along so well,
don't you think?

27
00:02:53,036 --> 00:02:56,469
I think we'll keep him...
with us, here.

28
00:02:56,569 --> 00:02:59,702
What in the name of the
Heavens are you saying,
Merciful Goddess?!

29
00:02:59,802 --> 00:03:03,069
You've never even kept
so much as a houseplant
without killing it!

30
00:03:03,169 --> 00:03:06,769
[Goddess] Silence! Did I say
"I" was going to keep him?

31
00:03:07,336 --> 00:03:09,369
Huh?

32
00:03:09,469 --> 00:03:13,402
[Goddess] He shall remain in
the care of my nephew, Konzen.

33
00:03:13,502 --> 00:03:14,836
Huh?!

34
00:03:14,936 --> 00:03:17,036
Why you worthless old hag!

35
00:03:17,136 --> 00:03:19,402
This is the Merciful
Goddess's mandate.

36
00:03:19,502 --> 00:03:22,702
Now, go have fun with your
new pet. Go on, run along.

37
00:03:23,902 --> 00:03:26,502
Hair like the sun...

38
00:03:26,602 --> 00:03:30,736
What a truly perfect
pickup line. The sun.

39
00:03:31,769 --> 00:03:33,902
[People laughing and talking]

40
00:03:36,802 --> 00:03:38,136
[Subordinate] General!

41
00:03:38,236 --> 00:03:39,702
General Kenren!

42
00:03:40,702 --> 00:03:43,236
Now where the hell
did he run off to?

43
00:03:48,902 --> 00:03:51,669
[Tenpou] You snuck away from the
banquet to drink by yourself?

44
00:03:52,502 --> 00:03:53,602
Yeah, so?

45
00:03:53,702 --> 00:03:55,702
Those poor subordinates
of yours are searching

46
00:03:55,802 --> 00:03:57,769
all over the place for you.

47
00:03:58,569 --> 00:04:00,436
[Kenren] Give me a break.

48
00:04:00,536 --> 00:04:04,336
The last thing I want to do is
suck up to those old geezers.

49
00:04:04,436 --> 00:04:07,136
Granted I won't disagree
with you on that point,

50
00:04:07,236 --> 00:04:10,036
but you should still show a
little respect for your elders.

51
00:04:10,136 --> 00:04:12,736
Need I remind you,
they are gods...

52
00:04:12,836 --> 00:04:14,902
General Kenren.

53
00:04:15,036 --> 00:04:18,736
Speaking of which, shouldn't you
be making an appearance for me?

54
00:04:18,836 --> 00:04:24,136
Tenpou, it's the adjutant's job
to attend official functions
in the General's absence.

55
00:04:24,236 --> 00:04:26,036
No thank you.

56
00:04:26,136 --> 00:04:27,569
I've got better things to do.

57
00:04:27,669 --> 00:04:28,802
That so?

58
00:04:30,269 --> 00:04:32,002
Flowers are great.

59
00:04:32,102 --> 00:04:34,036
Women are better.

60
00:04:34,136 --> 00:04:38,402
But I tell you, a glass of good
rice wine is just heavenly.

61
00:04:38,502 --> 00:04:40,336
[Tenpou] Kenren...
[Kenren] Yeah?

62
00:04:40,436 --> 00:04:46,802
I guess you really have no clue
at all what it is like to be
positively bored to death.

63
00:04:46,936 --> 00:04:48,336
What do you mean by that?

64
00:04:48,436 --> 00:04:50,436
I know someone like that.

65
00:04:50,536 --> 00:04:52,836
Someone who cannot
appreciate flowers,

66
00:04:52,936 --> 00:04:57,336
or know the pleasure of a woman,
or enjoy a good bottle of wine.

67
00:04:59,069 --> 00:05:01,002
[Kenren] No wonder he's bored.

68
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:04,336
[Konzen] Merciful my ass!

69
00:05:04,436 --> 00:05:06,869
She's dumping all
her problems on me!

70
00:05:06,969 --> 00:05:09,836
Where the hell did that
midget run off to now?!

71
00:05:09,936 --> 00:05:13,036
[Attendant] What is it? What
did he do this time, my lord?
[Konzen] That... little... brat!

72
00:05:13,136 --> 00:05:15,502
[Konzen] He made origami
out of all of my documents.

73
00:05:15,602 --> 00:05:16,936
Go look for yourself!

74
00:05:17,036 --> 00:05:18,669
[Both] Yes, Sir!

75
00:05:18,769 --> 00:05:21,602
[Konzen] I won't go easy
on him this time. I swear
if I find that little pest,

76
00:05:21,702 --> 00:05:23,502
[Goku] Scary...
[Konzen] I'll skin him alive!

77
00:05:26,602 --> 00:05:28,802
He sure is pretty,
I'll give him that.

78
00:05:28,902 --> 00:05:31,902
Then again, he yells a lot.

79
00:05:32,002 --> 00:05:33,702
And hits me sometimes.

80
00:05:38,469 --> 00:05:41,236
<i>I guess I could go hide.</i>

81
00:05:41,336 --> 00:05:45,236
<i>These chains are kind of heavy,</i>
<i>and... cold and they hurt.</i>

82
00:05:46,036 --> 00:05:47,636
<i>But I don't mind all that.</i>

83
00:05:47,736 --> 00:05:51,336
<i>Even if they get in</i>
<i>the way sometimes.</i>

84
00:05:51,436 --> 00:05:56,636
<i>I don't really understand,</i>
<i>but... maybe I was wrong</i>
<i>to be there.</i>

85
00:05:56,736 --> 00:06:00,769
<i>The sky was blue</i>
<i>and lots of green.</i>

86
00:06:00,869 --> 00:06:05,536
<i>There the water was cool...</i>
<i>and the breeze was warm.</i>

87
00:06:05,636 --> 00:06:08,569
<i>All the people</i>
<i>were alright too.</i>

88
00:06:08,669 --> 00:06:10,336
<i>Not like here...</i>

89
00:06:10,436 --> 00:06:12,269
<i>where everyone's so lifeless.</i>

90
00:06:14,136 --> 00:06:16,902
<i>Everyone except the gold one.</i>

91
00:06:17,002 --> 00:06:18,569
<i>He's like the sun.</i>

92
00:06:33,102 --> 00:06:34,836
<i>[Rinrei] I wish...</i>

93
00:06:34,936 --> 00:06:38,902
<i>I wish it could stay like</i>
<i>this forever, my darling.</i>

94
00:06:39,002 --> 00:06:41,669
<i>I'm still... a little girl.</i>

95
00:06:42,602 --> 00:06:44,969
<i>Grasping at fairytales.</i>

96
00:06:54,502 --> 00:06:56,469
I could hide in here, I guess.

97
00:06:58,202 --> 00:07:00,469
I wonder what this
room is used for?

98
00:07:04,102 --> 00:07:05,236
[Nataku] Hey!

99
00:07:06,002 --> 00:07:07,669
What are you doing here?

100
00:07:11,536 --> 00:07:13,736
<i>[Goku] A kid about my age?</i>

101
00:07:14,736 --> 00:07:17,902
Answer me. Tell me,
boy, who you are.

102
00:07:21,902 --> 00:07:23,669
<i>[Goku] Who am I?</i>

103
00:07:23,769 --> 00:07:25,702
[Attendant 1] Lord Nataku?!
[Attendant 2] Hey kid,
where are you?
[Nataku] Crap!

104
00:07:25,802 --> 00:07:27,936
[Nataku] Nevermind! Over here!

105
00:07:28,036 --> 00:07:29,002
[Attendant 2] Where
are you hiding?!

106
00:07:29,102 --> 00:07:30,302
[Attendant 1] Did you find him?

107
00:07:30,402 --> 00:07:31,369
Where the hell is he?

108
00:07:31,469 --> 00:07:33,836
[Attendant 2] Lord Nataku,
are you in here?

109
00:07:33,969 --> 00:07:36,369
Aaaah. I don't see him.

110
00:07:36,469 --> 00:07:38,436
Now where could that
little brat be?

111
00:07:42,002 --> 00:07:45,536
Haha. Morons.

112
00:07:45,636 --> 00:07:48,936
You musta gotten in trouble too.
What'd you do?

113
00:07:49,036 --> 00:07:50,836
It wasn't that big a deal.

114
00:07:50,936 --> 00:07:53,369
The Jade Emperor's
always so stuck up,

115
00:07:53,469 --> 00:07:58,369
so while he was sleeping, I
drew some nose hairs on him.

116
00:07:58,469 --> 00:08:01,836
[Goku laughs] That's great!
[Nataku] Really think so?!

117
00:08:01,936 --> 00:08:04,202
[Goku] I wish I could have
been there to see that.

118
00:08:04,302 --> 00:08:07,202
Aaaah, I should have
taken a picture of it!

119
00:08:08,002 --> 00:08:10,102
I think you're alright, kid.

120
00:08:10,202 --> 00:08:12,102
I'm Nataku. Who are you?

121
00:08:13,602 --> 00:08:16,102
I guess... I don't...

122
00:08:16,202 --> 00:08:17,936
I really don't have a name yet.

123
00:08:18,036 --> 00:08:22,569
I didn't have anyone to
give me one, so... I'm weird.

124
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:26,002
They think I'm a heretic
'cause I was born from a rock.

125
00:08:26,102 --> 00:08:28,002
And my gold eyes scare
the hell outta 'em.

126
00:08:28,102 --> 00:08:31,636
I think that's why I have to
be kept locked up in here.

127
00:08:31,736 --> 00:08:35,602
Wow. That is absolutely amazing.

128
00:08:35,702 --> 00:08:36,836
Huh?

129
00:08:36,936 --> 00:08:39,736
[Nataku] You say in
the whole entire world,

130
00:08:39,836 --> 00:08:42,969
there's no one else like
you? Is that right?

131
00:08:43,069 --> 00:08:45,769
That's just amazing.

132
00:08:45,869 --> 00:08:47,902
So that's where
you've been hiding!

133
00:08:48,002 --> 00:08:49,569
Let me tell you!

134
00:08:49,669 --> 00:08:53,169
The Jade Emperor is not too
happy with you right now.

135
00:08:53,269 --> 00:08:55,469
[Nataku sighs] I'm coming.

136
00:08:56,136 --> 00:08:57,202
[Goku] Nataku!

137
00:08:57,302 --> 00:08:59,536
Hey, can we play again sometime?

138
00:09:00,236 --> 00:09:02,136
Yeah, that'd be awesome!

139
00:09:10,782 --> 00:09:12,983
[Konzen] So, you made a friend?

140
00:09:12,983 --> 00:09:15,849
[Goku] Yeah, he's kind
of bossy, but I like him.

141
00:09:15,949 --> 00:09:17,716
[Konzen] Maybe you can
stay out of trouble.

142
00:09:17,849 --> 00:09:19,049
[Goku] Meh. I'll try.

143
00:09:19,149 --> 00:09:22,649
<i>[Konzen] About the only kid</i>
<i>his age around here is...</i>

144
00:09:22,749 --> 00:09:25,083
<i>No way.</i>

145
00:09:25,183 --> 00:09:26,316
What is it?

146
00:09:26,416 --> 00:09:28,316
Hey, Konzen.

147
00:09:28,416 --> 00:09:30,383
Could you give me a name?

148
00:09:32,283 --> 00:09:34,716
[Konzen] What brought this on?
[Goku] Because the
next time I see him,

149
00:09:34,816 --> 00:09:36,049
I want to give him my name!

150
00:09:36,149 --> 00:09:40,116
Don't you understand?!
I don't want to be some nobody!

151
00:09:40,216 --> 00:09:41,483
That's why!

152
00:09:42,383 --> 00:09:43,616
[Konzen] I'll get around to it.

153
00:09:43,716 --> 00:09:47,116
Come on! Name me now! What am I?

154
00:09:47,216 --> 00:09:50,449
How 'bout "Monkey" if
you're going to be
so insistent about it.

155
00:09:51,783 --> 00:09:54,316
Damn you! Do you wanna die?!

156
00:09:59,949 --> 00:10:01,116
[Konzen] Goku.
[Goku] Huh?

157
00:10:01,216 --> 00:10:02,716
[Konzen] Your name is Goku.

158
00:10:02,816 --> 00:10:04,249
It's short and simple enough.

159
00:10:04,349 --> 00:10:06,716
Even a monkey like
you can remember it.

160
00:10:07,416 --> 00:10:09,449
Goku...

161
00:10:09,549 --> 00:10:12,449
That's not too bad.
Gotta nice ring to it.

162
00:10:12,549 --> 00:10:15,216
Hey, what's it mean?
What's it mean?!

163
00:10:15,316 --> 00:10:17,316
[Konzen] Will you
stop pestering me?!

164
00:10:17,416 --> 00:10:18,649
[Goku] Tell me!

165
00:10:24,649 --> 00:10:25,849
Zenon.

166
00:10:25,949 --> 00:10:27,816
Yeah, Shien?

167
00:10:27,916 --> 00:10:29,949
I've just heard a rumor.

168
00:10:30,049 --> 00:10:31,249
[Zenon] That so?

169
00:10:31,349 --> 00:10:35,249
Is it true you've been spending
time in the Lower World?

170
00:10:35,349 --> 00:10:38,783
I have. S'not all that bad.

171
00:10:41,283 --> 00:10:43,749
Better than this stupid place.

172
00:10:43,849 --> 00:10:48,583
Turns out the futile struggle
of mortal life suits me.

173
00:10:48,683 --> 00:10:52,749
I see. So that is how
you've been coping.

174
00:10:55,216 --> 00:10:58,516
Naw, it's just that
I hate the Heavens.

175
00:10:58,616 --> 00:11:02,316
I'll get banished from
here too, just you watch.

176
00:11:03,383 --> 00:11:04,649
[Glass shattering]

177
00:11:06,316 --> 00:11:09,549
[Soldier] Rinrei!
You're coming with us.

178
00:11:09,649 --> 00:11:12,349
[Man 1] Did you hear?
Rinrei's been incarcerated.

179
00:11:12,449 --> 00:11:15,549
[Woman] I hear she was fooling
around with that Homura fellow.

180
00:11:15,649 --> 00:11:17,516
[Man 2] You're kidding me!

181
00:11:18,716 --> 00:11:20,116
<i>[Homura] Rinrei...</i>

182
00:11:20,216 --> 00:11:23,449
[Goku] Hey! Is it okay
if I pick some flowers?

183
00:11:23,549 --> 00:11:25,083
Uh, yeah. Sure.

184
00:11:25,183 --> 00:11:26,549
Go right ahead, if you want.

185
00:11:27,316 --> 00:11:29,316
[Goku] Thanks!

186
00:11:29,416 --> 00:11:31,949
<i>[Homura] There's no one</i>
<i>to share these with now.</i>

187
00:11:34,583 --> 00:11:36,483
<i>Chains?</i>

188
00:11:36,583 --> 00:11:38,616
<i>He must be a criminal.</i>

189
00:11:38,716 --> 00:11:41,983
<i>Or perhaps, he's just like me.</i>

190
00:11:42,083 --> 00:11:46,116
Hey, my name is Goku.
Ha. How 'bout you?

191
00:11:50,416 --> 00:11:53,283
Man, what is his problem?

192
00:11:54,983 --> 00:11:59,516
[Tenpou] Wow, it's certainly
become more active since the
last time I've been here.

193
00:12:00,516 --> 00:12:01,883
[Konzen] You could say that.

194
00:12:01,983 --> 00:12:03,516
[Goku] Konzen!

195
00:12:03,616 --> 00:12:05,716
Oh, I'm sorry.

196
00:12:05,816 --> 00:12:07,316
[Tenpou] It's quite alright.

197
00:12:07,416 --> 00:12:08,416
Come in.

198
00:12:08,516 --> 00:12:12,749
I'm Goku! What about you?
Are you Mister...?

199
00:12:12,849 --> 00:12:14,916
Mister's far too formal.

200
00:12:15,016 --> 00:12:18,616
Since Konzen and I are such
old friends, just call me Tenpy.

201
00:12:18,716 --> 00:12:20,616
Only my friends
can call me that.

202
00:12:20,716 --> 00:12:23,816
Ha! That's too funny!

203
00:12:23,916 --> 00:12:26,883
[Konzen] What's up with
this "Tenpy" crap?

204
00:12:26,983 --> 00:12:30,749
Since when did the Field
Marshal of the army...

205
00:12:30,849 --> 00:12:34,116
start taking a liking to
spoiled little brats?

206
00:12:34,216 --> 00:12:38,183
You know, I don't think
I've ever seen you this
lively and charming before.

207
00:12:38,983 --> 00:12:39,916
Huh?

208
00:12:40,016 --> 00:12:42,783
Goku, is it? You've
got a good name.

209
00:12:43,483 --> 00:12:45,916
Huh? Wow...

210
00:12:46,016 --> 00:12:50,349
[Tenpou] Goku. One who sees
the ephemeral nature of life.

211
00:12:52,216 --> 00:12:54,549
[Konzen] Oh please.

212
00:12:54,649 --> 00:12:57,816
Don't you already have
yourselves a troublemaker
in the army?

213
00:12:59,149 --> 00:13:01,483
Oh, I believe so.

214
00:13:01,583 --> 00:13:04,283
And he's much bigger
than this little one here.

215
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:06,583
It's Kenren, I believe.

216
00:13:06,683 --> 00:13:10,916
I hear he gives the war gods a
real run for their money. Hm?

217
00:13:11,016 --> 00:13:14,183
He has a sharp mind, but
to his detriment or credit,

218
00:13:14,283 --> 00:13:16,516
he does whatever he pleases.

219
00:13:16,616 --> 00:13:18,449
That's made him a few enemies.

220
00:13:19,883 --> 00:13:23,216
[Konzen] Some of them belong to
the upper ranks of the military.

221
00:13:23,316 --> 00:13:27,016
Yes, he has, but that's
only because they have
something to hide.

222
00:13:27,649 --> 00:13:29,649
You've noticed it too?

223
00:13:30,483 --> 00:13:32,383
[Tenpou] You could say that.

224
00:13:32,483 --> 00:13:35,949
All these military actions
seem a little contrived.

225
00:13:38,883 --> 00:13:42,716
Here in Heaven, we don't know
the sting of death during war.

226
00:13:42,816 --> 00:13:48,283
The Heavenly Army is used only
to supress rebellion when it
arises in the Lower World.

227
00:13:49,549 --> 00:13:52,416
I fear that war has
become merely a tool...

228
00:13:55,016 --> 00:13:59,016
that the gods use to
impose their ideology
and power over others.

229
00:14:00,583 --> 00:14:03,516
Well, I don't know why I'm
boring you with all this.

230
00:14:04,116 --> 00:14:05,649
We'll talk more later.

231
00:14:05,749 --> 00:14:07,783
[Konzen] Tenpou!
[Tenpou] Yes?

232
00:14:07,883 --> 00:14:11,049
I believe a Field Marshal
outranks a General.

233
00:14:11,149 --> 00:14:14,416
Why exactly are you
content as an adjutant?

234
00:14:14,516 --> 00:14:16,383
I don't like the spotlight.

235
00:14:16,483 --> 00:14:18,583
[Goku] Are you going
home now, Tenpy?

236
00:14:18,683 --> 00:14:20,249
Yeah. You take care.

237
00:14:21,316 --> 00:14:24,449
Okay, bye-bye.

238
00:14:24,549 --> 00:14:26,516
<i>[Konzen] It's not all</i>
<i>clear to me yet,</i>

239
00:14:26,616 --> 00:14:29,349
<i>but there's something</i>
<i>sinister at play here.</i>

240
00:14:29,449 --> 00:14:33,683
<i>I wonder if he's letting</i>
<i>the General loose to</i>
<i>provoke the upper ranks?</i>

241
00:14:33,783 --> 00:14:36,616
<i>If he is, talk about your</i>
<i>brilliant strategist.</i>

242
00:14:39,883 --> 00:14:43,583
[Emperor] War Prince Nataku,
step forward!

243
00:14:43,683 --> 00:14:44,949
[Nataku] Yes, Sir.

244
00:14:50,249 --> 00:14:52,383
[Lower God 1] Here he comes.
Just look at him.

245
00:14:52,516 --> 00:14:56,749
[Lower God 2] How did such
a sassy brat ever reach
the rank of war god?

246
00:14:56,849 --> 00:15:00,716
[Lower God 3] I hear he can slay
a monster eight times his size
with a single blow.

247
00:15:00,816 --> 00:15:03,449
[Lower God 1] It's the work
of the devil, if you ask me.

248
00:15:03,549 --> 00:15:06,049
[Lower God 2] True, who
knows what gave birth t-

249
00:15:06,149 --> 00:15:09,649
If you've got something to say,
then speak up, pal.

250
00:15:11,449 --> 00:15:15,583
Nataku, you are here
for only one reason.

251
00:15:15,683 --> 00:15:19,783
Look at that. You can still
see some nose hairs on you.

252
00:15:19,883 --> 00:15:21,716
That's enough!

253
00:15:21,816 --> 00:15:26,083
We'll have no more of your
foolish insubordination.

254
00:15:26,183 --> 00:15:28,383
I have an important
task for you.

255
00:15:28,483 --> 00:15:34,283
A great demon is terroizing
the Lower World, devouring
humans as he pleases.

256
00:15:35,583 --> 00:15:39,849
You shall go there,
and stop the demon Gyumaoh!

257
00:15:39,949 --> 00:15:41,849
As you wish, my Lord, of course.

258
00:15:41,949 --> 00:15:44,349
We hereby gratefully
accept this task.

259
00:15:44,449 --> 00:15:46,049
<i>[Nataku] What a suck-up...</i>

260
00:15:46,149 --> 00:15:48,649
[Emperor] Gyumaoh possesses
great strength.

261
00:15:48,749 --> 00:15:52,383
Some have even gone so
far as to call him
the God of Destruction.

262
00:15:52,483 --> 00:15:55,149
But he should be nothing
compared to your powers.

263
00:15:55,249 --> 00:15:59,649
We pale next to you lord, but
never fear. We shall prevail.

264
00:15:59,749 --> 00:16:03,316
Do you accept this task,
Prince Nataku?

265
00:16:03,416 --> 00:16:07,816
<i>[Nataku] So in the end,</i>
<i>I'm nothing more than</i>
<i>your hired assassin.</i>

266
00:16:08,449 --> 00:16:09,583
Yes, sir.

267
00:16:10,916 --> 00:16:12,649
<i>[Nataku] I will never grow up.</i>

268
00:16:12,749 --> 00:16:15,249
<i>Not if it means</i>
<i>becoming like you.</i>

269
00:16:17,349 --> 00:16:19,549
[Li] Am I understood?

270
00:16:19,649 --> 00:16:23,316
Prince Nataku is to fight Lord
Gyumaoh without interference.

271
00:16:23,416 --> 00:16:26,783
Then why send us if
we're just a stand by?

272
00:16:27,649 --> 00:16:30,149
You will do exactly as I say!

273
00:16:30,249 --> 00:16:32,349
It is not your place
to question!

274
00:16:33,583 --> 00:16:34,716
Aye.

275
00:16:49,171 --> 00:16:50,305
Hey!

276
00:16:51,171 --> 00:16:52,271
Have you no eyes?

277
00:16:52,371 --> 00:16:54,671
Do you not recognize
your superior officer?

278
00:16:56,038 --> 00:16:58,538
Yeah. Sorry about that.

279
00:16:58,638 --> 00:17:00,238
How's it goin', man?

280
00:17:01,438 --> 00:17:02,138
Later.

281
00:17:02,238 --> 00:17:04,105
[Gojun] General Kenren.

282
00:17:04,205 --> 00:17:08,538
What is it now, soldier boy?
I gotta go. Make it quick.

283
00:17:08,671 --> 00:17:11,538
Is that a wine flask
attached to your belt?

284
00:17:11,638 --> 00:17:14,171
[Kenren] What, this?
This is fuel.

285
00:17:14,271 --> 00:17:17,105
You know if it weren't
for your good friend Tenpou,

286
00:17:17,205 --> 00:17:20,071
you would have been gone
from here a long time ago.

287
00:17:20,171 --> 00:17:23,805
You should be grateful you
have such good friends.

288
00:17:23,905 --> 00:17:29,405
Haha. Speaking of friends, you
should keep that hound of yours
on a leash. Know what I mean?

289
00:17:29,505 --> 00:17:30,671
Is that so?

290
00:17:30,771 --> 00:17:34,005
See ya around.

291
00:17:34,105 --> 00:17:36,505
<i>[Kenren] Dragon King</i>
<i>of the Western Seas,</i>

292
00:17:36,605 --> 00:17:39,305
<i>more like a pompous ass to me.</i>

293
00:17:39,405 --> 00:17:43,238
<i>I don't care if he does come</i>
<i>from an elite clan of war gods.</i>

294
00:17:43,338 --> 00:17:44,605
<i>That white skin and red eyes...</i>

295
00:17:44,705 --> 00:17:47,505
<i>I just can't take</i>
<i>a liking to him.</i>

296
00:17:49,805 --> 00:17:51,071
[Konzen] Here you go.

297
00:17:51,171 --> 00:17:52,405
[Goddess] What's this?

298
00:17:52,505 --> 00:17:54,205
A late document.

299
00:17:54,305 --> 00:17:57,838
That damn monkey's nothing
but a constant distraction.

300
00:17:57,938 --> 00:18:00,905
Assign him to someone else,
will you please?

301
00:18:02,171 --> 00:18:04,738
When you're having so much fun?

302
00:18:04,838 --> 00:18:08,205
Don't you have anything better
to do than torture me?!

303
00:18:08,305 --> 00:18:11,005
[Goddess] And you make
such a wonderful daddy.

304
00:18:11,105 --> 00:18:12,971
Real funny.

305
00:18:13,071 --> 00:18:16,371
By the way, have you ever
heard of Field Marshal Tenpou?

306
00:18:16,505 --> 00:18:20,538
Yeah, he's a real pretty boy,
but a bit of an eccentric
from what I hear.

307
00:18:21,438 --> 00:18:22,871
And why do you ask?

308
00:18:22,971 --> 00:18:26,938
[Konzen] Let's just say he
questions the motives
of those in charge.

309
00:18:27,038 --> 00:18:29,305
He's a lot shrewder
than he looks.

310
00:18:29,405 --> 00:18:32,971
I wouldn't be surprised if
he mucks things up around
here a little bit.

311
00:18:33,071 --> 00:18:35,371
I thought he was a
friend of yours?

312
00:18:35,471 --> 00:18:38,538
Are you sure you wanna snitch?

313
00:18:38,638 --> 00:18:40,238
You can call it what you will.

314
00:18:40,338 --> 00:18:42,171
You're the only one
I'm telling this to.

315
00:18:42,271 --> 00:18:46,005
This has got absolutely
nothing to do with me.

316
00:18:46,105 --> 00:18:48,671
But the recent unrest
must be obvious,

317
00:18:48,771 --> 00:18:51,238
even to you guys upstairs.

318
00:18:51,338 --> 00:18:54,405
Some things even I
don't catch wind of.

319
00:18:55,638 --> 00:18:57,138
However...

320
00:18:57,238 --> 00:18:58,305
However?

321
00:18:58,405 --> 00:19:00,971
Nevermind. It's
probably no big deal.

322
00:19:01,071 --> 00:19:03,538
Well, that's neither here
nor there. But I'll be more

323
00:19:03,638 --> 00:19:06,971
careful in the future when
disciplining my hounds.

324
00:19:07,071 --> 00:19:08,038
[Konzen] Sure.

325
00:19:08,138 --> 00:19:09,171
[Goddess] What's this?

326
00:19:09,271 --> 00:19:12,005
Just a little something
that monkey put there.

327
00:19:12,105 --> 00:19:14,405
Some sort of a decoration,
I think.

328
00:19:14,505 --> 00:19:17,405
My, they certainly are pretty.

329
00:19:18,738 --> 00:19:20,405
I guess so.

330
00:19:23,605 --> 00:19:26,905
You have changed... Konzen.

331
00:19:27,005 --> 00:19:29,471
I have not! Now get outta here!

332
00:19:29,571 --> 00:19:31,171
What's wrong with that?

333
00:19:31,271 --> 00:19:34,438
Things that never
change are so lame.

334
00:19:34,538 --> 00:19:36,305
Don't you think?

335
00:19:40,871 --> 00:19:42,205
[Konzen] I suppose so.

336
00:20:36,271 --> 00:20:41,971
[Goddess] And time passed
quietly as the wheels of
fate slowly began to turn.
