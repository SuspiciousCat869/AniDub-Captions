1
00:01:46,847 --> 00:01:48,547
Looks like another dead end.

2
00:01:48,547 --> 00:01:50,547
AUGH! Are you getting it?!

3
00:01:50,647 --> 00:01:53,913
It looks like this stupid
forest is trying to get
us, or something.

4
00:01:54,013 --> 00:01:55,513
Hey, listen... You guys...

5
00:01:55,613 --> 00:01:57,813
Don't even say it, stupid chimp.

6
00:02:00,147 --> 00:02:04,013
It shouldn't have taken us
more than an hour to get
through this forest.

7
00:02:04,113 --> 00:02:06,613
Why don't you just admit
that you're lost?

8
00:02:08,413 --> 00:02:09,980
I won't say it.

9
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,280
With this fog, we should
probably just stop right here.

10
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:16,180
What if the fog doesn't clear?
Did you ever think of that?

11
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:20,047
What do you think we
should do? Rough it.

12
00:02:20,147 --> 00:02:21,280
Rough it, huh?

13
00:02:24,813 --> 00:02:26,880
Where do you think you're goin'?

14
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:29,913
[Gojyo] I'm not sleeping
tonight, unless there's
a woman beside me.

15
00:02:30,013 --> 00:02:31,747
Meet up with you guys later.

16
00:02:31,847 --> 00:02:33,413
Wait for me!

17
00:02:37,113 --> 00:02:39,013
Slow down! Gojyo!

18
00:02:39,113 --> 00:02:40,480
Sanzo...

19
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:42,213
What do I care?

20
00:02:46,513 --> 00:02:48,013
[Goku] "The Bond of Brothers."

21
00:03:00,413 --> 00:03:03,413
[Goku] I could have sworn I
smelled barbeque over there.

22
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:13,347
Will you help look for a way
out of this stupid forest?

23
00:03:13,447 --> 00:03:15,447
You and I can worry
about food later.

24
00:03:15,547 --> 00:03:18,580
[Goku] I can't walk around
on an empty stomach!

25
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,380
Hey! That smells edible.

26
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:21,880
Stupid brat.

27
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:32,713
Huh?

28
00:03:54,613 --> 00:03:56,847
Red flowers...

29
00:03:56,947 --> 00:03:59,713
Look here, mom! Look
what I got for you!

30
00:03:59,813 --> 00:04:02,680
I brought these from the flower
shop. Aren't they pretty?

31
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:04,180
So red too.

32
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,547
They remind me...

33
00:04:05,647 --> 00:04:06,780
OF BLOOD!

34
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,447
[Young Gojyo] Ow, mom! Stop it!
[Stepmom] You bastard!

35
00:04:11,547 --> 00:04:14,880
[Stepmom] Just like the blood
of that despicable woman!
[Young Gojyo] Mom, that hurts!

36
00:04:15,013 --> 00:04:16,513
[Stepmom] How could you
be so thoughtless?!
[Young Gojyo] Ow, stop! Ow, ow!

37
00:04:16,613 --> 00:04:19,113
[Stepmom] What are you
trying to say to me?
[Door opens]

38
00:04:19,213 --> 00:04:22,580
[Stepmom] You thoughtless
boy! How could you?!
[Jien] Mom?!

39
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,947
[Jien] You're hurting him!
[Stepmom] How could you?!

40
00:04:25,047 --> 00:04:26,580
[Stepmother sobs] Oh, Jien!

41
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:30,313
Gojyo... Gojyo, go to your room.

42
00:04:30,413 --> 00:04:34,647
[Stepmom] Jien, you're the
only reason I can survive
that evil child.

43
00:04:38,947 --> 00:04:41,780
<i>Man, that sure brings</i>
<i>up some memories.</i>

44
00:04:42,547 --> 00:04:43,680
Huh?

45
00:04:47,747 --> 00:04:51,080
Talk about your
shit luck. Damn it.

46
00:05:06,513 --> 00:05:08,280
<i>A breeze?</i>

47
00:05:10,847 --> 00:05:12,980
<i>I wonder where this leads.</i>

48
00:05:21,513 --> 00:05:22,980
<i>I've got time to kill.</i>

49
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,313
Goku!

50
00:05:25,413 --> 00:05:28,147
Hey, check this out!
I found a noodle stand!

51
00:05:28,247 --> 00:05:29,747
Free meat buns, buddy!

52
00:05:31,913 --> 00:05:33,613
That answers that.

53
00:05:53,847 --> 00:05:55,680
Which way should I go?

54
00:05:57,613 --> 00:06:00,047
Heads, I go right,
tails, I go left.

55
00:06:08,213 --> 00:06:09,347
Tails it is.

56
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,880
And you can be my bread crumb.

57
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:16,213
So no one better think
about taking you.

58
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,380
Not again.

59
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:45,213
I kind of thought it was
a good idea at the time,

60
00:06:45,313 --> 00:06:47,580
but I'll be in the
poor house at this rate.

61
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:55,180
I got tails the first time.

62
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,413
Huh?

63
00:06:57,747 --> 00:06:59,347
What's going on here?

64
00:07:05,247 --> 00:07:09,780
Hey! What's the big idea of
going out on me at a time like
this, you stupid lighter?!

65
00:07:12,313 --> 00:07:13,447
Piece of shit!

66
00:07:17,147 --> 00:07:18,680
<i>Now, what'll I do?</i>

67
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:20,347
<i>Man, this sucks.</i>

68
00:07:21,047 --> 00:07:23,547
[Footsteps approach]

69
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,613
Huh?!

70
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,213
My brother?

71
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:49,047
[Yaone] Sure is taking a while.
I wonder what he's doing.

72
00:07:50,613 --> 00:07:53,580
Probably waiting out the
rain, like the rest of us.

73
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,380
I'm sure he's fine.

74
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,613
Yes.

75
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:05,480
<i>Still, there's something</i>
<i>about this forest that</i>
<i>doesn't feel right.</i>

76
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:07,713
<i>First the fog and</i>
<i>now this rain.</i>

77
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,347
Is something... wrong?

78
00:08:11,647 --> 00:08:13,380
No, not at all.

79
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:15,513
You know what you
are, Big Brother.

80
00:08:15,613 --> 00:08:16,747
A worry wart.

81
00:08:17,613 --> 00:08:18,747
I am not.

82
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:23,647
<i>Actually, I hope I</i>
<i>am just worrying.</i>

83
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:30,980
[Gojyo] What are the odds
of both of us getting lost
in the same forest?

84
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,947
Oh man, you're telling me.

85
00:08:33,047 --> 00:08:36,713
By the way, I wouldn't be
so friendly if we weren't
trapped here together.

86
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,413
[Gojyo] What is it?

87
00:08:41,747 --> 00:08:44,280
I made that mark when
I came by here.

88
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:46,680
I guess that settles it then.

89
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:49,980
Someone blocked the
way out of here.

90
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,580
Now you level with me.

91
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:55,113
This wasn't you guys, was it?

92
00:08:55,213 --> 00:08:59,680
If it was, I wouldn't lock
myself up alone with you,
that's for sure.

93
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:02,280
[Gojyo] What did you say?!
[Dokugakuji] And to think,

94
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:05,713
I thought my luck was
finally gonna change
when I found this.

95
00:09:05,813 --> 00:09:07,013
Hey! That's my change!

96
00:09:07,113 --> 00:09:08,947
It was on the ground.

97
00:09:09,047 --> 00:09:12,113
[Gojyo] I was leaving a
trail, you idiot! Give-

98
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:13,780
Not my problem!

99
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,380
You give them back!

100
00:09:17,447 --> 00:09:18,613
[Younger Gojyo] Those are mine!

101
00:09:18,713 --> 00:09:20,913
No way! You'll just spend
it all on dice or something!

102
00:09:21,013 --> 00:09:22,247
I'll hold onto it for you.

103
00:09:22,347 --> 00:09:23,680
[Younger Gojyo] Give it!
[Jien] No!

104
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:25,680
You'll just spend it on
something for yourself!

105
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:27,280
Now give it back to me!

106
00:09:29,113 --> 00:09:30,613
Stop being an asshole!

107
00:09:33,613 --> 00:09:36,180
You never could keep your
money, you little shithead.

108
00:09:40,247 --> 00:09:42,880
Hand it to me next
time, asshole!

109
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:45,780
Thanks a lot. Now I can't
see where they rolled to.

110
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:48,347
You always were a dick.

111
00:09:50,113 --> 00:09:52,880
Damn it. Now I'm missing one.

112
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:57,313
[Dokugakuji] Listen, Gojyo...
[Gojyo] Huh?

113
00:09:57,413 --> 00:10:00,847
If we ever decide to
end this feud of ours...

114
00:10:00,947 --> 00:10:03,513
[Gojyo] Hey. Will ya look at
that.

115
00:10:03,613 --> 00:10:04,847
[Dokugakuhi] What is it?

116
00:10:06,813 --> 00:10:08,147
A talisman?

117
00:10:08,247 --> 00:10:10,880
Looks like we found the
source of our blockade.

118
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:12,613
Damn troublemaker.

119
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,780
Wait, don't touch it!

120
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,013
[Gojyo] Why?

121
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,880
[Evil, bemused chuckling]

122
00:10:22,013 --> 00:10:25,780
[Voice] Idiots. You've hastened
your own deaths.

123
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:31,213
[Gojyo] Oh yeah?
[Yousui] I'm Yousui, your
chauffeur to the world beyond.

124
00:10:31,313 --> 00:10:33,413
Homura's boy.

125
00:10:33,513 --> 00:10:35,880
[Yousui] I suppose
you could say that.

126
00:10:37,047 --> 00:10:38,847
Show yourself!

127
00:10:38,947 --> 00:10:43,247
[Yousui] Now why would
I do that, if I can kill
you from the shadows?

128
00:10:44,247 --> 00:10:46,680
Welcome... to your tomb.

129
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:52,313
[Gojyo and Dokugakuji scream]

130
00:11:19,761 --> 00:11:23,602
[Hakkai] The rain finally lets
up, and we're back to fog again.

131
00:11:23,602 --> 00:11:27,202
[Sanzo] It would seem
that someone doesn't want
us to leave the forest.

132
00:11:28,302 --> 00:11:30,068
So you think all
this could be...

133
00:11:32,435 --> 00:11:34,102
Who would want to
leave this place?

134
00:11:34,202 --> 00:11:37,202
There's so much
food around here!

135
00:11:37,302 --> 00:11:39,568
Think with your brain for
once in your life, will you?!

136
00:11:39,668 --> 00:11:42,368
It's hard with a concussion!

137
00:11:42,468 --> 00:11:45,168
Sanzo... you think
something happened?

138
00:11:45,268 --> 00:11:49,402
It's hard to say. All
we can do right now...

139
00:11:49,502 --> 00:11:55,102
is conserve our strength.
So we'll just have to be
prepared when it comes after us.

140
00:12:13,235 --> 00:12:15,235
[Dokugakuji] Ooow!

141
00:12:15,335 --> 00:12:19,235
[Gojyo] Can't say anyone's
tried to do me in with
a ceiling before.

142
00:12:20,468 --> 00:12:23,435
I seriously doubt he thinks
he killed us that easily.

143
00:12:23,535 --> 00:12:27,668
It's sure nice to be
held in such high esteem.

144
00:12:27,768 --> 00:12:31,035
Do you have to be so careless,
you little dumbass?!

145
00:12:31,135 --> 00:12:34,135
That talisman was an obvious
trap set for both of us!

146
00:12:34,235 --> 00:12:36,202
A goddamn blind man
could see that!

147
00:12:36,302 --> 00:12:39,135
It's my nature, I can't
help peeling off things.

148
00:12:39,235 --> 00:12:41,468
Chick's blouses, or talismans.

149
00:12:41,568 --> 00:12:44,035
You don't change. Still a brat.

150
00:12:44,135 --> 00:12:46,302
You were once a
brat too, you know!

151
00:12:46,402 --> 00:12:47,535
Smartass.

152
00:12:48,702 --> 00:12:50,535
What's the matter? You alright?

153
00:12:50,635 --> 00:12:52,335
Don't worry, I'll get over it.

154
00:13:01,702 --> 00:13:03,768
You know, that use to be me...

155
00:13:03,868 --> 00:13:06,035
who always wrapped the bandages.

156
00:13:09,568 --> 00:13:13,968
You were always tagging along
behind me, always getting hurt.

157
00:13:14,068 --> 00:13:16,335
[Gojyo] You were nicer then.

158
00:13:16,435 --> 00:13:20,535
[Dokugakuji] I guess I got tired
of patching up your wounds.

159
00:13:20,635 --> 00:13:26,068
Now I know. That's why you
keep that stupid bandana around
your head, for emergencies.

160
00:13:26,168 --> 00:13:27,868
Hmph. Whatever.

161
00:13:32,768 --> 00:13:35,535
[Gojyo] Ah, jeez.
This is hardly original.

162
00:13:35,635 --> 00:13:38,535
But effective. Why
mess with the classics?

163
00:13:38,635 --> 00:13:40,435
It may work with most people...

164
00:13:40,535 --> 00:13:41,935
but not with me!

165
00:13:43,568 --> 00:13:46,535
Damn it. That idea worked
out better in my head.

166
00:13:46,635 --> 00:13:49,602
You can knock all you want,
I don't think anybody's home.

167
00:13:49,702 --> 00:13:54,702
Shhh, be quiet! I'm trying to
probe the wall for a weakness
of some sort, you idiot.

168
00:13:54,802 --> 00:13:56,935
[Gojyo] And knocking's
going to find it?

169
00:13:57,035 --> 00:13:58,535
I said be quiet!

170
00:13:58,635 --> 00:14:00,802
I'm so sick of you and
your big brother act!

171
00:14:04,102 --> 00:14:05,735
Okay, smart guy.

172
00:14:05,835 --> 00:14:09,068
Do it quick, 'cause this is
getting too cozy for my blood.

173
00:14:11,435 --> 00:14:12,868
I found it!

174
00:14:12,968 --> 00:14:14,568
Well, it's about time!

175
00:14:26,002 --> 00:14:27,768
[Yousui chuckles]

176
00:14:27,868 --> 00:14:30,002
[Yousui] Resourceful.

177
00:14:30,102 --> 00:14:32,002
Just as I'd hoped they would be.

178
00:14:33,035 --> 00:14:36,102
But not nearly
resourceful enough.

179
00:14:36,202 --> 00:14:37,968
[Yousui chuckles]

180
00:14:44,302 --> 00:14:45,535
[Gojyo] A hallway.

181
00:14:45,635 --> 00:14:48,402
It's a lot newer than the
other corridor we were in.

182
00:14:50,402 --> 00:14:53,068
Hey, doesn't this floor
look sloped to you?

183
00:14:53,168 --> 00:14:54,535
[Wall breaking]

184
00:14:56,835 --> 00:14:57,968
[Rushing water]

185
00:15:10,635 --> 00:15:13,068
Oh, now it's the
rising water bit!

186
00:15:13,168 --> 00:15:16,535
Whoever he is, he hasn't been
taking us too seriously.

187
00:15:16,635 --> 00:15:20,068
[Yousui] I'd hate for
you to think I don't
appreciate your talent.

188
00:15:32,935 --> 00:15:34,435
Dokugakuji!

189
00:15:37,302 --> 00:15:41,335
[Yousui] My talent is the
ability to conjure water beasts.

190
00:15:41,435 --> 00:15:42,968
You like?

191
00:15:43,068 --> 00:15:47,102
If you prefer, drowning
is always an option.

192
00:15:51,002 --> 00:15:51,935
Are you okay?

193
00:15:52,035 --> 00:15:53,768
He didn't hurt you bad, did he?

194
00:15:53,868 --> 00:15:54,735
Nah.

195
00:15:54,835 --> 00:15:55,968
Get ready.

196
00:16:02,335 --> 00:16:05,535
Hey! What're you doin'?! Let go!

197
00:16:05,635 --> 00:16:07,635
I think it's rather obvious.

198
00:16:07,735 --> 00:16:11,268
I figure since you and
I are mortal enemies...

199
00:16:12,735 --> 00:16:15,702
We might as well settle the
small matter between us

200
00:16:15,802 --> 00:16:18,602
before they do it for us.

201
00:16:18,702 --> 00:16:20,102
Bastard...

202
00:16:20,202 --> 00:16:24,002
[Yousui] Interesting. You plan
to save me the trouble, eh?

203
00:16:24,102 --> 00:16:25,235
Very well.

204
00:16:26,935 --> 00:16:28,902
Are you... ready, Jien?

205
00:16:35,702 --> 00:16:36,935
You asshole!

206
00:16:47,335 --> 00:16:48,402
Gojyo!

207
00:16:48,502 --> 00:16:50,502
[Yousui] Nice job. Of course,

208
00:16:50,602 --> 00:16:52,902
I still have to kill you!

209
00:17:16,002 --> 00:17:18,302
Let's see how long
your breath can last.

210
00:17:19,168 --> 00:17:20,668
[Knocking sound]

211
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:26,302
[Yousui] What?!

212
00:17:26,402 --> 00:17:27,635
Well, hello there.

213
00:17:27,735 --> 00:17:30,168
Whaddya know? Jien was right.

214
00:17:30,268 --> 00:17:32,902
You can find an exit
just by knocking.

215
00:17:33,002 --> 00:17:35,302
But you... you were
killed by the other man!

216
00:17:35,402 --> 00:17:36,835
That's impossible!

217
00:17:36,935 --> 00:17:39,502
[Gojyo] Yeah, I guess it did
look that way, didn't it?

218
00:17:39,602 --> 00:17:41,668
[Yousui] It was all...
a monkey show!

219
00:17:41,768 --> 00:17:44,702
I left the monkey back in
the forest, if you must know.

220
00:17:46,102 --> 00:17:47,235
Water beasts!

221
00:17:51,235 --> 00:17:52,868
You're all wet!

222
00:17:59,468 --> 00:18:03,668
I fear your friend would have
run out of air long before now.

223
00:18:03,768 --> 00:18:06,335
I will face Homura
without shame.

224
00:18:08,268 --> 00:18:09,402
[Yousui screams]

225
00:18:10,402 --> 00:18:11,535
[Gojyo] Jien!

226
00:18:37,802 --> 00:18:38,935
Jien!

227
00:19:04,077 --> 00:19:07,556
I think I'll stay clear
of red flowers from now on.

228
00:19:07,556 --> 00:19:10,656
They only seem to
bring bad luck.

229
00:19:10,756 --> 00:19:13,523
I actually kind of like
red flowers, myself.

230
00:19:15,256 --> 00:19:16,956
You're such a pansy.

231
00:19:18,456 --> 00:19:20,489
[Hakkai] Gojyo!

232
00:19:20,589 --> 00:19:22,823
[Goku] Where have you
been, water sprite?

233
00:19:24,656 --> 00:19:26,789
Well, looks like
your ride's here.

234
00:19:26,889 --> 00:19:29,056
I was here! Waiting for you!

235
00:19:31,556 --> 00:19:34,156
I will withdraw our
little rivalry for today.

236
00:19:34,256 --> 00:19:36,323
You and I will
settle this later.

237
00:19:38,423 --> 00:19:39,589
Sure.

238
00:19:46,756 --> 00:19:48,689
<i>Wait a second...</i>

239
00:19:48,789 --> 00:19:51,256
<i>I never found that coin.</i>

240
00:19:51,356 --> 00:19:53,856
<i>I guess I'll swipe</i>
<i>one from the monkey.</i>

241
00:19:55,423 --> 00:19:56,956
[Yaone] There he is!

242
00:20:01,989 --> 00:20:03,589
Where have you been?!

243
00:20:03,689 --> 00:20:06,456
I about starved to
death looking for you!

244
00:20:07,156 --> 00:20:09,723
Tell me... what happened?

245
00:20:09,823 --> 00:20:11,123
Well, I got caught in the rain.

246
00:20:13,089 --> 00:20:16,056
And then, to be honest, I took
a little trip down memory lane.

247
00:20:22,589 --> 00:20:24,689
Look, guys! The
exit's right there!

248
00:20:24,789 --> 00:20:27,489
I wonder why we couldn't
find it before?

249
00:20:27,589 --> 00:20:28,923
It was because...

250
00:20:29,056 --> 00:20:32,023
You just didn't look hard
enough, you big dumbass.

251
00:20:32,123 --> 00:20:34,323
You were looking too, Gojyo!

252
00:20:34,423 --> 00:20:37,523
It's 'cause you only think
with your stupid stomach!

253
00:20:37,623 --> 00:20:40,723
It's your fault for not
figuring that out by now!

254
00:20:40,823 --> 00:20:41,756
[Hakkai laughs]

255
00:20:41,856 --> 00:20:43,789
[Hakkai] You know,
he has a point, Gojyo.
