1
00:01:38,447 --> 00:01:42,967
[Narrator] It was a time
when Heaven and Earth
coexsisted peacefully.

2
00:01:42,967 --> 00:01:47,134
Where demon and man were
more than neighbors.
They were brothers.

3
00:01:49,767 --> 00:01:52,901
Here civilization and faith
were born, the foundations
of man.

4
00:01:53,001 --> 00:01:54,634
It was Shangri-La.

5
00:01:56,701 --> 00:02:00,934
But then, the brotherhood of man
and demon turned.

6
00:02:01,034 --> 00:02:04,567
Man became Abel to demon's Cain.

7
00:02:09,467 --> 00:02:14,834
They grew angry, and powerful
and hungry.

8
00:02:14,934 --> 00:02:20,934
And they convened far to the
west under the command of one.

9
00:02:34,067 --> 00:02:35,534
[Monk 1] How dare you! Get down!

10
00:02:35,634 --> 00:02:38,801
[Monk 2] This tree does not bear
fruit for one such as you.

11
00:02:39,734 --> 00:02:42,201
[Goku] Relax! This bush
is loaded.

12
00:02:42,301 --> 00:02:45,934
There's plenty to go around, and
I'm starvin'!

13
00:02:49,334 --> 00:02:51,967
What is it now? What's he done
this time?

14
00:02:52,067 --> 00:02:56,034
Your companion feels entitled
to partake in some of the
local produce.

15
00:02:56,134 --> 00:02:59,967
These peaches are offerings to
the Merciful Goddess! Get him
down now!

16
00:03:00,067 --> 00:03:03,567
A peach is a peach, is a peach.
Get over it!

17
00:03:03,667 --> 00:03:04,934
He's not mcompanion!

18
00:03:05,034 --> 00:03:07,567
It's guilt by association and
that's all!

19
00:03:07,667 --> 00:03:08,967
If you say...

20
00:03:09,067 --> 00:03:11,167
Get down, Goku!

21
00:03:11,267 --> 00:03:13,167
[Sanzo] Dinner's over, let's go.

22
00:03:13,934 --> 00:03:14,867
Go where?

23
00:03:14,967 --> 00:03:16,334
You gonna take me to a real
restaurant?

24
00:03:16,434 --> 00:03:20,867
Huh? are you? Huh? Huh? Hey!
Huh? Huh? Hey! Huh? Huh? Hey!

25
00:03:21,401 --> 00:03:22,467
Shut up!

26
00:03:22,567 --> 00:03:24,801
Ow! What the did you do
that for?!

27
00:03:24,901 --> 00:03:27,134
[Sanzo] Just shut up and get
changed or I'll do it again!

28
00:03:27,234 --> 00:03:30,101
And if you don't move it now,
I'm leaving you behind!

29
00:03:30,201 --> 00:03:32,201
Alright, fine. I'm going.

30
00:03:32,301 --> 00:03:35,067
He is no better than an
unruly child.

31
00:03:35,167 --> 00:03:37,634
Why would a priest with a
spiritual heritage so

32
00:03:37,734 --> 00:03:41,267
respectable as Sanzo travel with
such a frivilous degenerate?

33
00:03:41,367 --> 00:03:43,101
For this I have no answer.

34
00:03:45,701 --> 00:03:47,867
Don't act like I'm not here.

35
00:03:47,967 --> 00:03:52,034
Besides, what I pick up or I
throw away is none of
your business.

36
00:03:52,134 --> 00:03:54,567
Pick up? What do you mean, like
a disease?

37
00:03:54,667 --> 00:03:57,134
Shut your mouth and move
your ass!

38
00:03:59,167 --> 00:04:01,801
<i>Why did I pick him up?</i>

39
00:04:01,901 --> 00:04:03,567
<i>That's what I'd like to know.</i>

40
00:04:06,601 --> 00:04:09,834
<i>[Sanzo] You, are you the one</i>
<i>who's been calling to me?</i>

41
00:04:09,934 --> 00:04:14,567
<i>[Goku] Huh? No, I haven't been</i>
<i>calling to anyone at all.</i>

42
00:04:14,667 --> 00:04:16,501
<i>Wh-Who are you?</i>

43
00:04:16,601 --> 00:04:17,901
<i>Look kid, don't lie to me.</i>

44
00:04:18,001 --> 00:04:20,934
<i>I've heard you calling out to</i>
<i>me for years.</i>

45
00:04:21,034 --> 00:04:24,234
<i>It's annoying, and I'm heard</i>
<i>now so you can quit calling.</i>

46
00:04:26,467 --> 00:04:30,467
<i>Come on. You're coming with me,</i>
<i>it's fate.</i>

47
00:04:34,901 --> 00:04:36,201
[Goku] Wait up!

48
00:04:36,301 --> 00:04:40,701
Hey, come on man, tell me where
we're going! Come on! Tell me!

49
00:04:40,801 --> 00:04:43,001
Hey? Hey, hey? Come on tell me!
Come on, Tell me!

50
00:04:43,101 --> 00:04:45,067
Sanzo, tell me where, man!
Huh? Huh? Huh?

51
00:04:45,167 --> 00:04:47,434
One more sound and I'm going to
kill you!

52
00:04:47,567 --> 00:04:49,667
[Goku] Come on, at least tell me
where we're going!

53
00:04:49,767 --> 00:04:51,434
I promise I'll keep it a secret.

54
00:04:51,534 --> 00:04:55,001
We're going to look for Hakkai
and Gojyo.

55
00:04:55,101 --> 00:04:57,767
We find them and go.

56
00:04:57,867 --> 00:04:59,034
Go where?

57
00:05:25,767 --> 00:05:27,967
[Woman 1] Good luck, Gojyo!

58
00:05:28,067 --> 00:05:30,234
[Woman 2] Come on, you can
do it.

59
00:05:30,334 --> 00:05:32,501
[Soushi] Don't bet on it.

60
00:05:32,601 --> 00:05:36,001
Two pairs, two pairs jacks
over kings.

61
00:05:37,701 --> 00:05:41,534
Wow what a coincidence, I've got
two pairs too.

62
00:05:41,634 --> 00:05:45,734
A pair of queens and another
pair of queens.

63
00:05:45,834 --> 00:05:48,434
I believe the term is four of
a kind.

64
00:05:48,534 --> 00:05:50,434
[Woman 1] Oh, nice!

65
00:05:50,534 --> 00:05:52,067
[Woman 2] Very nice.

66
00:05:52,167 --> 00:05:54,701
Damn it! Just take it all!

67
00:05:54,801 --> 00:05:56,601
[Soushi] Take all of it!

68
00:05:56,701 --> 00:05:58,701
Sorry about that, Soushi.

69
00:05:58,801 --> 00:06:01,367
Believe me, these three queens
around me,

70
00:06:01,467 --> 00:06:03,734
are more important than the four
on the table.

71
00:06:12,334 --> 00:06:13,567
Stop it!

72
00:06:16,467 --> 00:06:19,801
<i>He's lost it. What going on?</i>

73
00:06:25,301 --> 00:06:26,967
I said knock it off!

74
00:06:38,067 --> 00:06:39,634
Step down, Soushi.

75
00:06:39,734 --> 00:06:42,201
It was just a friendly little
game of cards.

76
00:06:44,234 --> 00:06:47,667
Alright then. You can have it
your way.

77
00:06:57,101 --> 00:07:01,467
That sucks. I always made money
off of that guy too.

78
00:07:12,934 --> 00:07:15,767
God, I need a katana to see
through this shit.

79
00:07:15,867 --> 00:07:17,734
Hakuryu, hit the fog lights,
will you?

80
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:23,801
Holy shit!

81
00:07:25,834 --> 00:07:28,701
Look out kid! Get out of the
way! Hakuryu, transform!

82
00:07:34,667 --> 00:07:36,467
Geeze kid, that was too close.

83
00:07:37,834 --> 00:07:39,101
Are you alright, kid?

84
00:07:45,034 --> 00:07:46,567
You're just a little shaken up.

85
00:07:46,667 --> 00:07:49,534
Come on kid, let's get up and
I'll help you find your
parents. Okay?

86
00:07:53,301 --> 00:07:56,267
My name's Hakkai. Who are you?

87
00:07:59,534 --> 00:08:04,234
Oh? Come on kid, don't be afraid
I'm not gonna hurt you,
I promise.

88
00:08:12,201 --> 00:08:14,834
Don't do that. We're
practically family.

89
00:08:14,934 --> 00:08:17,134
That's right man, I'm just
like you.

90
00:08:18,601 --> 00:08:21,101
Well, maybe I've got a little
more self control.

91
00:08:21,201 --> 00:08:23,534
But what happened? Where are
your power limiters?

92
00:08:27,067 --> 00:08:28,901
[Hakkai] Don't worry, I'll help
you find them.

93
00:08:36,067 --> 00:08:37,734
That settles that.

94
00:08:37,834 --> 00:08:40,401
This kid didn't lose his power
limiter he took the damn
thing off

95
00:08:40,501 --> 00:08:42,034
and he doesn't want it back.

96
00:08:42,134 --> 00:08:43,301
It's time to go!

97
00:09:00,767 --> 00:09:05,034
Whoa! And here I was worried
that you'd be out here all
alone and defencless.

98
00:09:05,134 --> 00:09:08,167
Come on Hakuryu, let's just
leave these boys alone.

99
00:09:08,267 --> 00:09:10,201
They're not going to need
my protection.

100
00:09:15,667 --> 00:09:18,467
Yeah I know, I felt it too.

101
00:09:18,567 --> 00:09:21,201
Dark and hungry.

102
00:09:21,301 --> 00:09:24,301
There's some serious spiritual
shit going down.

103
00:09:24,401 --> 00:09:26,667
Do you can drive a little faster
if you want.

104
00:09:44,382 --> 00:09:46,982
[Goku] Man, I'm hungry!

105
00:09:47,082 --> 00:09:49,248
Come on Sanzo, how long until we
get there, man?

106
00:09:49,348 --> 00:09:53,482
I'm sick of walking and I'm
getting tired of waiting
for lunch!

107
00:09:53,582 --> 00:09:55,548
Hey! I'm talking to you!

108
00:09:55,648 --> 00:09:57,482
And I'm sick of it!

109
00:09:57,582 --> 00:10:00,482
We'll never get there if you
keep taking breaks ever
five minutes!

110
00:10:00,582 --> 00:10:04,182
Why the hell are you being such
a hardass? I'm hungry!

111
00:10:04,282 --> 00:10:06,382
You're a preist, how about a
little compassion!

112
00:10:06,482 --> 00:10:10,482
Look, you and I both know it
isn't possible for you to
starve to death.

113
00:10:10,582 --> 00:10:12,515
Yeah, well you don't know that
for a fact.

114
00:10:12,615 --> 00:10:13,748
Yes I do.

115
00:10:13,848 --> 00:10:15,815
Well instead of turning this
into a death march,

116
00:10:15,915 --> 00:10:18,448
you could've just had Hakkai
pick us up in the jeep!

117
00:10:18,548 --> 00:10:20,615
Shut up and get up!

118
00:10:20,715 --> 00:10:24,915
And what you're sudden buring
desire to go hook up with Hakkai
and Gojyo anyway?

119
00:10:26,382 --> 00:10:28,482
Yeah, I thought that'd getcha.

120
00:10:30,215 --> 00:10:32,748
There's something I need
to confirm.

121
00:10:32,848 --> 00:10:35,148
What do you mean? What do you
need to confirm?

122
00:10:36,782 --> 00:10:40,848
Yesterday, I was summoned to the
Temple of the Setting Sun
in Chang'an.

123
00:10:45,315 --> 00:10:50,548
[Sanzo] Servant of the Northern
God of Heaven, Genjo Sanzo,
humbly presents himself.

124
00:10:57,082 --> 00:11:00,715
[Sanbutsushin 1] It was good of
you to come, Genjo Sanzo.

125
00:11:00,815 --> 00:11:01,882
Sire...

126
00:11:01,982 --> 00:11:04,248
[Sanbutsushin 1] Time is of
the essence.

127
00:11:04,348 --> 00:11:05,948
Pardon us for pressing you.

128
00:11:06,048 --> 00:11:08,648
Of course.

129
00:11:08,748 --> 00:11:14,782
Surely you can sense it, the
dark disturbance that gnaws
at this world.

130
00:11:14,882 --> 00:11:21,115
From the west to east, the
affliction now spans all
of Shangri-La.

131
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:23,248
[Sanbutsushin 3] The day of
brotherhood is fading.

132
00:11:23,348 --> 00:11:27,448
Demons who once walked in peace
with man grow now savage.

133
00:11:27,548 --> 00:11:29,748
Yes, I have seen it.

134
00:11:29,848 --> 00:11:32,848
[Sanzo] Humans now cower
before demons,

135
00:11:32,948 --> 00:11:35,082
they live their days in terror.

136
00:11:35,182 --> 00:11:41,415
Shangri-La is but a name or
memory. Now it is the very
picture of Hell.

137
00:11:41,515 --> 00:11:44,382
Tell me, do you know what
has caused this abomination?

138
00:11:44,482 --> 00:11:48,048
Have you ever heard whispers
of Gyumaoh?

139
00:11:50,215 --> 00:11:51,348
Gyumaoh!

140
00:11:59,915 --> 00:12:02,948
Tell us, what do you know of
this Gyumaoh?

141
00:12:03,048 --> 00:12:05,048
Gyumaoh...

142
00:12:05,182 --> 00:12:10,415
They say he is the great demon
who refused to coexist with
humans and devoured them.

143
00:12:10,515 --> 00:12:13,982
He devoured them as was
his pleasure.

144
00:12:14,082 --> 00:12:15,315
[Sanbutsushin] Go on.

145
00:12:15,415 --> 00:12:18,115
But Gyumaoh was put to rest in
the Houtou Castle

146
00:12:18,215 --> 00:12:21,448
by the war god, they say that
the Crown Prince Nataku,

147
00:12:21,548 --> 00:12:26,715
defeated the demon in the land
of India far west of here,
more than 500 years ago.

148
00:12:26,815 --> 00:12:29,182
[Sanbutsushin 1] But now,
Gyumaoh may breath again.

149
00:12:29,282 --> 00:12:33,682
He is being revived by someone.

150
00:12:33,782 --> 00:12:36,548
If unopposed this person
will succeed.

151
00:12:36,648 --> 00:12:40,048
Using science from another time
and forbidden magic.

152
00:12:40,148 --> 00:12:42,348
That sounds bad.

153
00:12:42,448 --> 00:12:43,882
Real bad.

154
00:12:44,915 --> 00:12:47,515
No one can predict what will
happen, Goku.

155
00:12:51,282 --> 00:12:55,148
[Sanbutsushi 3] Science and
black magic are diometrically
opposed to one another.

156
00:12:55,248 --> 00:13:00,782
As forbidden as the joining with
humans the negative aura will
destroy a delicate balance.

157
00:13:00,882 --> 00:13:05,382
That which must always maintain
separation can never be
brought together.

158
00:13:05,482 --> 00:13:08,082
And it is this spiritual
imbalance that is causing

159
00:13:08,182 --> 00:13:10,815
the savagery of the
demons unto humankind.

160
00:13:11,915 --> 00:13:13,015
[Sanbutsushin 1] Yes.

161
00:13:16,482 --> 00:13:19,848
And that is why we are forced
to make this demand of you.

162
00:13:19,948 --> 00:13:26,615
You have those with whom you
share a past, Goku, Gojyo,
and Hakkai.

163
00:13:26,715 --> 00:13:32,248
You four must travel India in
the far west, to the root of
this evil!

164
00:13:32,348 --> 00:13:38,348
[Sanbutsushin 2] Discover who is
conducting these experiments to
revive Gyumaoh and why.

165
00:13:38,448 --> 00:13:41,215
You cannot allow the monster to
be resurrected!

166
00:13:41,315 --> 00:13:44,215
So the demons can be recalled
to themselves.

167
00:13:44,315 --> 00:13:49,248
Then Shangri-La can once again
be restored to a land of peace
and tranquility.

168
00:13:50,215 --> 00:13:51,382
As you wish.

169
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:56,115
So, we hook it to this India
place, where ever that is,

170
00:13:56,215 --> 00:13:59,615
find out who's messing with
magic, make sure this Gyumaoh
guy stays dead,

171
00:13:59,715 --> 00:14:03,182
you look good for the three
heads and the demons go back
to being our buddies! Right?

172
00:14:03,282 --> 00:14:04,415
Let's do it!

173
00:14:06,115 --> 00:14:07,848
It's not as easy as all that.

174
00:14:07,948 --> 00:14:09,582
You worry too much.

175
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:12,448
It'll be a piece of cake,
Sanzo. Relax!

176
00:14:12,548 --> 00:14:13,848
[Sanzo] You don't get it.

177
00:14:13,948 --> 00:14:15,148
Sounds like a done deal to me.

178
00:14:15,248 --> 00:14:17,282
What do you need Hakkai and
Gojyo for?

179
00:14:17,382 --> 00:14:19,548
[Sanzo] Because, monkey boy, we-
[Rustling in the bushes]

180
00:14:21,815 --> 00:14:23,082
Oh shit!

181
00:14:36,115 --> 00:14:37,248
Watch your back.

182
00:14:40,315 --> 00:14:41,448
Freeze!

183
00:14:42,815 --> 00:14:46,815
Ha! Do you honestly believe a
puny little pistol

184
00:14:46,915 --> 00:14:48,982
will have any effect on a demom
such as I?

185
00:14:49,082 --> 00:14:51,082
Actually, no I don't.

186
00:14:51,182 --> 00:14:54,515
But this isn't just a puny
little pistol.

187
00:14:54,615 --> 00:14:57,182
It's a banishing gun.
Ever heard of it?

188
00:14:59,082 --> 00:15:00,015
Thought so.

189
00:15:00,115 --> 00:15:01,415
No! No, wait!

190
00:15:08,082 --> 00:15:12,415
You know they never listen.
Why don't they ever just
listen to me?

191
00:15:13,848 --> 00:15:15,115
[Goku] Uh Sanzo!

192
00:15:17,515 --> 00:15:19,882
So all these guys are friends
of Gyumaoh?

193
00:15:19,982 --> 00:15:22,848
Took off their power limiters
and switched to the other side.

194
00:15:23,248 --> 00:15:24,348
I smell...

195
00:15:24,448 --> 00:15:24,982
...human.

196
00:15:25,082 --> 00:15:26,548
I'm hungry.

197
00:15:27,448 --> 00:15:28,748
<i>There are too many of them.</i>

198
00:15:28,848 --> 00:15:31,115
This journey's not startin' out
too good.

199
00:15:37,248 --> 00:15:40,448
[Gojyo] So, things are bad
all over.

200
00:15:40,548 --> 00:15:44,048
You know, it looks to me like
Shangri-La's going to hell
in a handbasket.

201
00:15:44,148 --> 00:15:46,948
But I'm betting you guys have a
good idea how to get it back.

202
00:15:49,482 --> 00:15:51,882
It's Gojyo! And look Hakkai!

203
00:15:51,982 --> 00:15:53,715
Long time no see, Goku.

204
00:15:57,548 --> 00:16:00,682
Nice to see you both, even you,
you stupid monkey.

205
00:16:00,782 --> 00:16:03,315
Listen, water wimp, why don't
you watch your mouth, huh?

206
00:16:03,415 --> 00:16:05,648
Hey! You wanna start something?
Come on!

207
00:16:05,748 --> 00:16:08,082
[Goku] Oh pee-yuu, your breath
smells like ass!

208
00:16:08,182 --> 00:16:09,115
[Goku and Gojyo continue
arguing]
Oh boy.

209
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:10,648
[Goku and Gojyo continue
arguing]

210
00:16:10,748 --> 00:16:12,082
[Sanzo] How did you find us?

211
00:16:12,182 --> 00:16:15,782
[Hakkai] The demonic aura is
strong, I followed its
scent here.

212
00:16:17,882 --> 00:16:22,348
Unfortunatly, Gojyo and I have
witnessed scences like what
you've just experienced.

213
00:16:22,448 --> 00:16:25,848
Gojyo, Goku, and I are the only
demons who seem in control.

214
00:16:25,948 --> 00:16:27,982
Die! All of you, die!

215
00:16:35,815 --> 00:16:39,282
Kinda sad. Had all the attitude
in the world.

216
00:16:39,382 --> 00:16:41,248
But not a goddamn clue how to
use it.

217
00:16:41,348 --> 00:16:42,615
[Demon] Get him!

218
00:16:42,715 --> 00:16:44,548
[Hakkai] Hakuryu, gimme a
second will you?

219
00:16:44,648 --> 00:16:45,782
[Demon] The easy one!

220
00:16:58,082 --> 00:17:01,182
Man that was great, but what the
hell was that?

221
00:17:01,282 --> 00:17:03,982
Actually that was the first
time I used it.

222
00:17:04,082 --> 00:17:06,715
I wasn't sure I could pull
it off.

223
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:09,882
Okay, I kinda copied a move from
someone else.

224
00:17:09,982 --> 00:17:11,982
So you basically stole it
from someone.

225
00:17:12,082 --> 00:17:15,048
He has ear cuffs and the other
wears a band!

226
00:17:16,782 --> 00:17:18,848
They limit their powers
by choice!

227
00:17:18,948 --> 00:17:21,348
[Demon] You are demons,
are you not?!

228
00:17:22,348 --> 00:17:23,715
And if we are?

229
00:17:23,815 --> 00:17:26,215
You are our kind! Why do you
fight against us?!

230
00:17:26,315 --> 00:17:27,482
[Goku] Good question.

231
00:17:41,376 --> 00:17:45,376
<i>My Lords, I have one question I</i>
<i>wish to ask, if I may.</i>

232
00:17:47,176 --> 00:17:51,310
Why have you appointed these
three to be my companions?
They are demons.

233
00:17:51,410 --> 00:17:56,476
They are demons this is true,
but they are also human.

234
00:17:56,576 --> 00:18:02,410
This is why they can maintain
their sense of self and not
give in to the darker aura.

235
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:07,376
[Sanbutsushin 2] You have lived
long, Genjo Sanzo, so you should
know this well.

236
00:18:07,476 --> 00:18:12,143
Ironic yes, that the scars each
of them bears from their pasts

237
00:18:12,243 --> 00:18:15,276
are what form the web that
connects you all.

238
00:18:16,576 --> 00:18:20,376
[Goku] We're against you, cause
we're not like you!

239
00:18:20,476 --> 00:18:21,810
[Hakkai] Not technically!

240
00:18:21,910 --> 00:18:23,176
[Gojyo] Like you can talk!

241
00:18:23,276 --> 00:18:26,510
[Sanbutsushin 1] They have a
power and a spiritual strength.

242
00:18:26,610 --> 00:18:31,443
They are the trump cards in your
hand. Remember this.

243
00:18:31,543 --> 00:18:35,310
It is true that I cannot deny
their unique abilities.

244
00:18:35,410 --> 00:18:38,576
But nor can I forget that
demonic blood that flows
within their veins,

245
00:18:38,676 --> 00:18:44,510
My lord, can we truly devine
that this blood could never
gain supremacy, over
their souls?

246
00:18:44,610 --> 00:18:48,910
To place our faith blindly in
a lot such as this would be
foolish, perhaps fatal

247
00:18:49,043 --> 00:18:54,376
[Sanbutsushin 2] Your concern
has been noted. Still, this
does not change what is true.

248
00:18:54,476 --> 00:18:56,876
They are to be your companions.

249
00:18:56,976 --> 00:19:01,976
And it was not the Sanbutsushin
who has appointed these demons
to be your missionaries.

250
00:19:02,076 --> 00:19:06,076
The Merciful Goddess of the
Heavens has decreed it to you.

251
00:19:06,176 --> 00:19:08,110
The Merciful Goddess?!

252
00:19:14,043 --> 00:19:16,043
With all due respect,
I must confess,

253
00:19:16,143 --> 00:19:19,643
the only one I can trust in this
world is myself.

254
00:19:19,743 --> 00:19:24,310
Ever since I lost what was
dearest to me, my heart has
believed this.

255
00:19:24,410 --> 00:19:26,510
That cannot change.

256
00:19:26,610 --> 00:19:31,410
Things can appear differently
if you look with the eyes of
your heart, Genjo Sanzo.

257
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:34,176
I'm sorry, I don't understand.

258
00:19:34,276 --> 00:19:38,843
[Sanbutsushin] Go and meet them
and perhaps you will see for
yourself.

259
00:19:38,943 --> 00:19:44,643
Confirm that what you believe
now is actually true. And look
with different eyes.

260
00:19:45,276 --> 00:19:46,176
What's done...

261
00:19:46,276 --> 00:19:47,743
...is done!

262
00:19:47,843 --> 00:19:51,110
<i>Confrim what is true...</i>

263
00:19:51,210 --> 00:19:57,110
Traitors you would take the
side of the powerless and
arrogant humans!

264
00:19:57,210 --> 00:20:01,643
That is not where you belong!
Do not betray your own kind!

265
00:20:01,743 --> 00:20:05,943
Join us and raise your
voices with ours!

266
00:20:06,043 --> 00:20:08,910
Long live the demon kingdom
of Gyumaoh!

267
00:20:16,643 --> 00:20:18,243
[Gojyo] What a load of crap.

268
00:20:18,343 --> 00:20:20,910
Taking sides with the humans?

269
00:20:21,010 --> 00:20:24,476
Ha! From when I was born, til
the day I die,

270
00:20:24,576 --> 00:20:26,710
the only side I'm on, is mine.

271
00:20:27,910 --> 00:20:29,476
<i>The eye of the heart.</i>

272
00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:32,543
Goku?

273
00:20:34,343 --> 00:20:35,576
Gojyo?

274
00:20:35,676 --> 00:20:37,410
Yeah?

275
00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:38,710
Hakkai?

276
00:20:38,810 --> 00:20:40,110
Yes...

277
00:20:40,776 --> 00:20:42,476
We go... there!

278
00:20:44,843 --> 00:20:45,976
To the west.

279
00:22:29,210 --> 00:22:30,876
[Goku] Well that didn't take
long, just a couple of days
into our trip

280
00:22:30,976 --> 00:22:35,076
and they're already sending
assassins after us. I hate
this job.

281
00:22:35,176 --> 00:22:41,110
Oh yeah, and this bunch of
freaks is led by some nasty
spider skank. Not pretty.

282
00:22:41,210 --> 00:22:44,410
Then, of course, there's the
usual dilemma about dinner.

283
00:22:44,510 --> 00:22:46,210
Look at him - I hate that dude!

284
00:22:46,310 --> 00:22:48,210
[Gojyo] Ah bite me.
[Goku] You wish!

285
00:22:48,310 --> 00:22:50,110
[Goku] Stay tuned for the
next episode!
