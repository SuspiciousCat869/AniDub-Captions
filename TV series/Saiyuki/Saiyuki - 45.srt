1
00:02:12,641 --> 00:02:14,507
This is really pathetic.

2
00:02:17,474 --> 00:02:19,541
[Hakuryu whines]
[Door opens]

3
00:02:20,169 --> 00:02:22,769
Hey, hey, hey! Who's the man?

4
00:02:22,869 --> 00:02:25,036
Check out the catch I got,
you guys!

5
00:02:25,136 --> 00:02:27,969
[Goku] Oooh! We're gonna
eat tonight, fellas!
[Gojyo] Dumbass...

6
00:02:28,069 --> 00:02:33,336
[Goku] One, two, three, four...

7
00:02:33,436 --> 00:02:40,003
Five, six, seven, eight...

8
00:02:40,103 --> 00:02:43,836
Nine, ten...

9
00:02:43,936 --> 00:02:45,069
Eleven!

10
00:02:47,436 --> 00:02:49,269
There, that makes two each.

11
00:02:49,369 --> 00:02:52,336
But wait a minute. That still
leaves me with one extra.

12
00:02:52,436 --> 00:02:54,636
I think I should get that
one since I caught them all.

13
00:02:54,736 --> 00:02:57,036
That's fair. Yeah,
that's totally fair.

14
00:02:57,136 --> 00:03:00,503
Move over, Hakuryu, I need some
salt. Salt... there it is!

15
00:03:00,603 --> 00:03:01,803
[Goku] I could get
some if you stopped-
[Hakuryu squeaks]

16
00:03:01,903 --> 00:03:04,569
What the hell do you mean...
you get the extra one?!

17
00:03:04,669 --> 00:03:07,736
[Gojyo] We always
settle our disputes with
rock-paper-scissor, remember?
[Hakkai] My, my.

18
00:03:07,869 --> 00:03:08,936
[Hakkai] You do have some
tasty looking trout here.

19
00:03:09,036 --> 00:03:10,736
[Goku] It's okay.
I'll eat it, really.

20
00:03:10,836 --> 00:03:12,469
Hey! You're taking
the biggest one!

21
00:03:12,569 --> 00:03:14,336
[Gojyo] That's only fair
if you get the extra one.

22
00:03:14,436 --> 00:03:17,736
[Goku] I caught them!
So I get to decide who
gets what! Now hand it over!

23
00:03:17,836 --> 00:03:19,636
[Gojyo] That's only because
we let you catch them!

24
00:03:19,736 --> 00:03:21,636
Hakkai! Are you trying
to cut ahead of us?!

25
00:03:24,903 --> 00:03:26,369
[Goku] "Fighting the system."

26
00:03:45,169 --> 00:03:46,636
Having trouble sleeping?

27
00:03:52,503 --> 00:03:55,203
Will Sanzo... be alright?

28
00:03:55,303 --> 00:03:57,003
I'm sure he'll pull through.

29
00:04:13,336 --> 00:04:16,236
[Goku] Konzen!
Where are you going?

30
00:04:16,336 --> 00:04:18,736
Where are you going?
Tenpy's place is this way!

31
00:04:18,836 --> 00:04:20,936
Come on! I'll show
you a short cut!

32
00:04:22,969 --> 00:04:24,403
Tenpy's...? Why you...

33
00:04:24,503 --> 00:04:25,636
[Goku] Hurry, hurry!

34
00:04:26,703 --> 00:04:27,836
[Konzen] Damn.

35
00:04:32,403 --> 00:04:35,236
[Goku] Hurry! Hurry!
[Goddess] Hmph. Take a
look at this, Jiroushin.

36
00:04:35,336 --> 00:04:38,569
[Goddess] Now that's something
you don't see everyday.
[Goku] See? I told you
this way was quicker!

37
00:04:38,669 --> 00:04:41,736
[Jiroushin] Well, whaddya know?
[Goddess] Did you ever...
[Goku] Hey, keep up! I know lots

38
00:04:41,836 --> 00:04:45,403
[Goddess] think you'd see
someone leading HIM by the hand?
[Goku] of ways to get around!
C'mon, I'll show you!

39
00:04:45,503 --> 00:04:47,336
[Jiroushin] Well, I'll be...
[Goku] I can't wait.

40
00:04:47,469 --> 00:04:50,903
[Goku] Oh, I can't
wait to get there!
<i>[Goddess] That little</i>
<i>runt is something else.</i>

41
00:04:51,003 --> 00:04:54,436
Tenpy, hey! Where should
I put these things?

42
00:04:54,536 --> 00:04:58,069
Oh those? Just put them on
the back bookshelf somewhere.

43
00:04:58,169 --> 00:05:02,136
It sure is great to have someone
with your strength around, Goku.

44
00:05:02,236 --> 00:05:03,736
[Konzen] Gadnabbit.

45
00:05:03,836 --> 00:05:07,269
I only came here because
Goku badgered me into it.

46
00:05:07,369 --> 00:05:11,703
I don't see why I should clean
your room for you, you lazy,
manipulative bastard.

47
00:05:11,803 --> 00:05:15,069
[Tenpou laughs]
But it suits you so well.

48
00:05:16,869 --> 00:05:20,403
Hey. Why isn't Ken here?
Where is he?

49
00:05:20,536 --> 00:05:25,336
He had to report to the
main palace for a military
roll call, I'm afraid.

50
00:05:25,436 --> 00:05:27,069
And you didn't?

51
00:05:27,169 --> 00:05:30,669
[Tenpou] The order was issued
to Prince Nataku's army,
fortunately.

52
00:05:30,769 --> 00:05:34,903
Well, that's strange. Isn't
Nataku still recovering?

53
00:05:35,003 --> 00:05:39,369
Yes, but I'm sure
the administration doesn't
care at all about that tidbit.

54
00:05:40,403 --> 00:05:43,136
He's just their puppet,
after all.

55
00:05:43,236 --> 00:05:45,669
Awesome! Can I borrow this?!

56
00:05:45,769 --> 00:05:47,903
Can I?! Can I, please?!

57
00:05:48,003 --> 00:05:49,203
Of course you can.

58
00:05:49,303 --> 00:05:51,003
[Goku] Woo-hoo!

59
00:05:51,103 --> 00:05:54,469
I'll be, so the chimp
can read, can he?

60
00:05:54,603 --> 00:05:59,536
I love this one! It's about the
crime fighting meat bun of doom
and his band of friends:

61
00:05:59,636 --> 00:06:03,569
Pizza Pocket, Curry Curtis and
the sweet Madam Bean-Jam.

62
00:06:03,669 --> 00:06:06,303
Isn't it delicious?!

63
00:06:06,403 --> 00:06:07,703
Sorry I asked.

64
00:06:07,803 --> 00:06:09,836
[Tenpou chuckles]
It didn't take him long

65
00:06:09,936 --> 00:06:13,403
to master the fundamentals
of reading and writing,
that's good.

66
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:16,803
He picks things up pretty
quickly if it's something
he's interested in.

67
00:06:22,503 --> 00:06:25,769
Tell me, how well-stocked
is your library?

68
00:06:25,869 --> 00:06:30,303
Oooh, I keep a little bit
of everything, to be
honest with you.

69
00:06:30,403 --> 00:06:35,136
Tell you what, why don't
you lend me one of your
favorite titles sometime?

70
00:06:37,469 --> 00:06:39,203
I just might do that.

71
00:06:51,669 --> 00:06:54,336
[Nataku] I can show you all the
short cuts and hiding places.

72
00:06:54,436 --> 00:06:58,336
I know one spot where you
can stuff yourself with
raspberries until you puke.

73
00:06:58,436 --> 00:06:59,769
Come on, I'll show you!

74
00:06:59,869 --> 00:07:01,169
[Goku laughing]

75
00:07:02,669 --> 00:07:04,269
[Maiden] Lord Nataku...

76
00:07:04,369 --> 00:07:07,003
Time to get up. Your
father is waiting for you.

77
00:07:14,603 --> 00:07:17,236
[Crowd chatting]

78
00:07:17,336 --> 00:07:21,136
Not another campaign.
This is a perpetual war.

79
00:07:21,236 --> 00:07:24,803
[Soldier] What's the point of
having a War Prince around
if you don't use him?

80
00:07:24,903 --> 00:07:27,769
All we have to do is sit back
and watch the fireworks.

81
00:07:29,936 --> 00:07:31,136
Attention!

82
00:07:35,903 --> 00:07:38,036
Prince Nataku, come forward.

83
00:07:41,269 --> 00:07:43,936
Your Emperor requires
your service.

84
00:07:44,036 --> 00:07:45,869
I need you in the field.

85
00:07:47,303 --> 00:07:48,536
Yes.

86
00:07:48,636 --> 00:07:50,236
[Kenren] Excuse me,
your highness.

87
00:07:52,136 --> 00:07:54,369
[Official] Who speaks?!
[Kenren] Humble subordinate

88
00:07:54,469 --> 00:07:57,103
to the Dragon of
the Western Seas,

89
00:07:57,203 --> 00:07:59,436
General Kenren, Sire.

90
00:07:59,536 --> 00:08:02,736
General! What is the reason
for your disruption?

91
00:08:02,836 --> 00:08:05,603
Forgiveness, sire, but I
could not help but notice

92
00:08:05,703 --> 00:08:08,836
that Nataku's wounds are
not yet fully healed.

93
00:08:08,936 --> 00:08:13,003
So in honor of the courage
Nataku showed serving
the Emperor...

94
00:08:13,103 --> 00:08:18,703
I humbly request that you please
allow my army to fight in
Prince Nataku's place.

95
00:08:18,803 --> 00:08:21,903
[The crowd murmurs]

96
00:08:22,003 --> 00:08:24,703
Be quiet. Surely you
do not honestly believe

97
00:08:24,803 --> 00:08:28,236
that your army can
replace Prince Nataku.

98
00:08:28,336 --> 00:08:31,003
I'd like to think we'd
do better than all these

99
00:08:31,103 --> 00:08:34,403
coddled infants who don't like
to get their hands dirty.

100
00:08:34,503 --> 00:08:37,103
What are you implying,
General Kenren?!

101
00:08:37,203 --> 00:08:39,136
You're way outta line, General!

102
00:08:39,236 --> 00:08:43,436
General Kenren, I won't
let you disparage my son.

103
00:08:43,536 --> 00:08:45,269
NOT in this manner.

104
00:08:45,369 --> 00:08:48,269
He is the best warrior
in the Heavens, bar none.

105
00:08:48,369 --> 00:08:51,169
And his patriotism
is beyond reproach.

106
00:08:51,269 --> 00:08:55,669
If he is called to serve,
he will take the field
as duty dictates.

107
00:08:56,403 --> 00:08:58,136
Son... am I right?

108
00:08:59,069 --> 00:09:00,203
[Nataku] Yes, father.

109
00:09:03,769 --> 00:09:06,036
You make me proud, Nataku.

110
00:09:18,936 --> 00:09:20,236
[Nataku, softly] Thank you.

111
00:09:32,069 --> 00:09:33,569
As you know, General...

112
00:09:33,669 --> 00:09:36,669
defying the emperor
is a sacrilege.

113
00:09:36,769 --> 00:09:38,969
You're confined to quarters.

114
00:09:44,469 --> 00:09:48,136
Aaaw! I'm still not
allowed to see Nataku?

115
00:09:48,236 --> 00:09:51,303
I haven't been able to talk
to him since he got back!

116
00:09:51,403 --> 00:09:54,103
He must be hurt really bad.

117
00:09:54,203 --> 00:09:58,503
I know, and I don't like turning
you away every day, either.

118
00:09:58,603 --> 00:10:02,203
That's okay. After all, it's
not your fault he's been hurt.

119
00:10:02,303 --> 00:10:05,969
Take this! Give it to Nataku
for me. Will you do that?

120
00:10:06,069 --> 00:10:08,269
Of course. I can do that.

121
00:10:13,303 --> 00:10:15,703
"Confined to quarters", my ass!

122
00:10:15,803 --> 00:10:19,069
Feels more like toture and
imprisonment if you ask me!

123
00:10:19,169 --> 00:10:21,536
You should have
consulted with me.

124
00:10:21,669 --> 00:10:25,136
I would have passed on
your concerns to the
good Emperor myself.

125
00:10:25,236 --> 00:10:28,569
It was more fun this way,
you have to agree.

126
00:10:28,669 --> 00:10:30,703
Looks to me like
you had a blast.

127
00:10:30,803 --> 00:10:32,836
Oh please, this was nothing.

128
00:10:37,236 --> 00:10:41,336
Nataku's playful little
nudge hurt more than this.

129
00:10:41,436 --> 00:10:44,603
If you wanna know what
tortures me, man...

130
00:10:44,703 --> 00:10:47,836
it's seeing the way this
place treats that kid.

131
00:10:49,636 --> 00:10:52,669
But even that can't compare
to the pain of knowing...

132
00:10:52,769 --> 00:10:54,869
the brat can't even
admit it hurts.

133
00:10:55,969 --> 00:10:57,203
[Jiroushin] Merciful Goddess...

134
00:10:58,503 --> 00:11:00,103
About this document...

135
00:11:00,203 --> 00:11:01,403
[Jiroushin gasps]

136
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:03,336
What the-?!

137
00:11:03,436 --> 00:11:05,036
Don't you love it?

138
00:11:05,136 --> 00:11:07,903
I wouldn't have thought...
Uh, did you make it?

139
00:11:08,003 --> 00:11:09,903
You've got to be kidding me.

140
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:11,303
I just picked it up.

141
00:11:11,403 --> 00:11:12,403
[Jiroushin] Picked it up?

142
00:11:12,503 --> 00:11:13,603
That's right.

143
00:11:13,703 --> 00:11:16,069
[Goku] What?! Nataku's
still not better?

144
00:11:16,169 --> 00:11:18,403
[Maiden] Yes, I'm afraid you
won't be able to see him again.

145
00:11:18,503 --> 00:11:20,969
[Goddess] Flowers, disregarded
and forgotten.

146
00:11:21,069 --> 00:11:23,169
Like the one they
were intended for.

147
00:11:30,238 --> 00:11:31,438
[Kenren] Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

148
00:11:31,438 --> 00:11:33,771
That hurt, you
stupid little runt!

149
00:11:33,871 --> 00:11:35,738
Don't you listen to him, Goku.

150
00:11:35,838 --> 00:11:37,638
You just make it as
tight as you can,

151
00:11:37,738 --> 00:11:39,538
so it won't come loose, okay?

152
00:11:39,638 --> 00:11:42,571
What have you got against me,
mullet head?

153
00:11:42,671 --> 00:11:44,871
Hm. I don't even
know where to begin.

154
00:11:44,971 --> 00:11:47,338
The way you embarrassed
the Jade Emperor.

155
00:11:47,438 --> 00:11:48,505
[Kenren] Huh?

156
00:11:48,605 --> 00:11:50,338
[Tenpou] You got yourself
thrown into prison,

157
00:11:50,438 --> 00:11:55,271
and interrogated as a suspected
insurgent, and you're still
cracking jokes about it.

158
00:11:55,371 --> 00:11:58,371
I feel sorry for whoever has
to follow your orders.

159
00:11:58,471 --> 00:12:02,438
Please tell me, what did I
do to deserve this suffering?

160
00:12:02,538 --> 00:12:06,938
Yeah, yeah, I can't help myself.
It's in my nature.

161
00:12:07,038 --> 00:12:08,738
Oh, I know it is.

162
00:12:08,838 --> 00:12:12,338
But it was idiotic of you to
make Li Touten your enemy.

163
00:12:12,438 --> 00:12:15,338
He has had you dismissed
from your military duties.

164
00:12:17,105 --> 00:12:18,471
So?

165
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:20,838
[Tenpou] Don't you "so" me.

166
00:12:20,938 --> 00:12:24,571
I'm sorry, but things don't
roll off my back as easily
as they do yours.

167
00:12:25,871 --> 00:12:28,505
I'll have you know this
makes it difficult for me.

168
00:12:28,605 --> 00:12:30,505
I can't work for anyone.

169
00:12:31,338 --> 00:12:33,571
[Door opens]
[Kenren] Hey, now!

170
00:12:33,671 --> 00:12:35,405
I'm going out for a little walk.

171
00:12:35,505 --> 00:12:38,638
I've done all I can to
patch things up here.

172
00:12:38,738 --> 00:12:41,271
Goku, keep him out
of trouble, will ya?

173
00:12:41,371 --> 00:12:43,105
[Goku] Have a good time!

174
00:12:43,205 --> 00:12:46,571
Hey! What if I have
to take a wizz?!

175
00:12:46,671 --> 00:12:49,405
[Tenpou] I'll mop up after
you when I get back.

176
00:12:56,238 --> 00:13:00,038
Hey, Goku, would you mind
going after Tenpou for me?

177
00:13:00,138 --> 00:13:01,705
I'm on watch duty.

178
00:13:01,805 --> 00:13:04,138
Listen to me!

179
00:13:04,238 --> 00:13:08,138
He may not look it, but Tenpou
can be more impulsive than I am.

180
00:13:09,705 --> 00:13:13,171
[Goku] What's "impulsive" mean?
[Kenren] It means...

181
00:13:13,271 --> 00:13:16,371
[Door opens]
[Kenren] you don't want
to see him lose his temper.

182
00:13:18,505 --> 00:13:22,305
[Touten] Field Marshal Tenpou.
To what do I owe the pleasure?

183
00:13:22,405 --> 00:13:25,405
[Tenpou] I don't have
much patience for
pleasantries right now,

184
00:13:25,505 --> 00:13:27,671
so let's get right to
the point, shall we?

185
00:13:27,771 --> 00:13:30,738
I demand you reinstate
General Kenren at once.

186
00:13:32,171 --> 00:13:36,405
I thought you would come.
Please, have a seat.

187
00:13:36,505 --> 00:13:38,538
Now, I don't want to
appear rude here,

188
00:13:38,638 --> 00:13:42,805
but since when have you been in
a position to offer me a seat?

189
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:47,671
As I recall, you have
no affiliation with the
Heavenly Army whatsoever.

190
00:13:47,771 --> 00:13:53,405
Unless I'm mistaken, that gives
you no authority to meddle in
military affairs at all.

191
00:13:53,505 --> 00:13:56,738
[Touten chuckles] The Jade
Emperor has seen fit to

192
00:13:56,838 --> 00:13:59,538
entrust all military
matters to me.

193
00:14:01,738 --> 00:14:04,938
I speak with the
emperor's authority.

194
00:14:05,038 --> 00:14:06,871
You have absolutely no shame.

195
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:11,738
To sacrifice your own son,
Nataku, for the purpose of
advancing your own career?

196
00:14:11,838 --> 00:14:13,071
You make me sick.

197
00:14:14,338 --> 00:14:17,171
[Touten] You have
a pretty face.

198
00:14:17,305 --> 00:14:20,605
I'm sure there are lots
of other jobs for you,

199
00:14:20,705 --> 00:14:23,638
and your red haired boyfriend,
to pursue.

200
00:14:24,505 --> 00:14:25,638
Ya think?

201
00:14:27,805 --> 00:14:29,071
My lord, are you alright?!

202
00:14:29,171 --> 00:14:31,005
You bastard! Seize him!

203
00:14:32,038 --> 00:14:33,171
[Tenpou gives a small shout]

204
00:14:36,305 --> 00:14:39,838
[Touten] This is too precious.
What a sight.

205
00:14:39,938 --> 00:14:44,505
Now do you see? They no longer
follow orders from you.

206
00:14:44,605 --> 00:14:47,005
And they never will again.

207
00:14:47,105 --> 00:14:48,671
I am in charge.

208
00:14:51,338 --> 00:14:53,505
You know what?

209
00:14:53,605 --> 00:14:56,671
I think this calls
for an interrogation.

210
00:14:56,771 --> 00:14:58,705
Don't you...

211
00:14:58,805 --> 00:15:00,338
pick on him!

212
00:15:00,438 --> 00:15:01,738
Who the hell is this brat?!

213
00:15:01,838 --> 00:15:04,671
Goku?! Wha-why are you...

214
00:15:04,771 --> 00:15:06,838
General Kenren told me
to come and get you.

215
00:15:06,938 --> 00:15:09,471
He said you'd probably
be in big trouble.

216
00:15:10,238 --> 00:15:11,771
[Tenpou] Hmph. Did he now?

217
00:15:13,905 --> 00:15:15,738
What in the...

218
00:15:15,838 --> 00:15:18,305
Don't you dare lay
a hand on Tenpy.

219
00:15:18,405 --> 00:15:19,905
Do you understand me?

220
00:15:21,038 --> 00:15:23,438
Come on, Tenpy. Let's rock.

221
00:15:24,638 --> 00:15:26,538
Yeah, let's... rock.

222
00:15:26,638 --> 00:15:29,571
[Door opens and closes]

223
00:15:29,671 --> 00:15:32,038
Should we just let 'em
walk away, my lord?

224
00:15:32,138 --> 00:15:35,338
Stand down. It won't
change anything.

225
00:15:38,471 --> 00:15:42,538
[Konzen] Tell me, are you and
Kenren sharing the same stylist?

226
00:15:42,638 --> 00:15:47,038
Yes, and I think the fashion is
bound to catch on, eventually.

227
00:15:47,138 --> 00:15:48,771
Don't I look more rugged?

228
00:15:48,871 --> 00:15:52,671
You're full of it.
You better not have
gotten into trouble again.

229
00:15:52,771 --> 00:15:55,371
[Konzen] Goku.
[Goku] Huh?

230
00:15:55,471 --> 00:15:58,571
Let me see... I can't
remember, it's a secret.

231
00:15:58,671 --> 00:16:01,505
[Kenren whistles]

232
00:16:01,605 --> 00:16:06,405
[Konzen sighs] Oh, whatever.
Just don't drag Goku into
anything too weird.

233
00:16:06,505 --> 00:16:09,138
He's already hated enough
around here as it is.

234
00:16:09,238 --> 00:16:13,071
Well, I assume you're not here
to show off your bruised faces.

235
00:16:13,171 --> 00:16:14,638
Now what is it?

236
00:16:14,738 --> 00:16:17,371
They've called for another
military intervention.

237
00:16:17,471 --> 00:16:20,571
They're gonna send Nataku
back to the Lower World.

238
00:16:21,438 --> 00:16:23,305
Let's all welcome him home.

239
00:16:23,405 --> 00:16:24,905
Ah! I'll go!

240
00:16:26,638 --> 00:16:28,438
[Kenren] You coming?
[Konzen] No, I'm afraid

241
00:16:28,538 --> 00:16:31,371
[Konzen] I have to deliver
this document to the old hag.

242
00:16:31,505 --> 00:16:34,338
[Goku] Let's go, let's go!
[Kenren] Hold on.

243
00:16:34,438 --> 00:16:36,471
[Goku] I finally
get to see Nataku!
[Konzen] Tenpou...

244
00:16:36,571 --> 00:16:41,338
I know, Konzen. Goku shouldn't
get too attached to Nataku.

245
00:16:41,438 --> 00:16:44,171
That's what's bothering
you, right?

246
00:16:44,271 --> 00:16:47,505
Li Touten's son may very
well become a casualty of

247
00:16:47,605 --> 00:16:50,205
his unquenchable
thirst for power.

248
00:16:50,305 --> 00:16:55,205
Yet none of us can seem to help
wanting to see it, for just
a little while longer.

249
00:16:58,305 --> 00:16:59,805
That innocent smile...

250
00:17:02,671 --> 00:17:04,471
[Konzen] You can't be serious.

251
00:17:04,605 --> 00:17:07,505
Kenren is no longer the general?

252
00:17:07,605 --> 00:17:12,805
They kept their jobs, but not
without some heavy duty lobbying
from your friend, Tenpou.

253
00:17:14,205 --> 00:17:16,771
But Li Touten is vindictive.

254
00:17:16,871 --> 00:17:19,071
It will come at a heavy price.

255
00:17:19,171 --> 00:17:21,071
Then what about their injuries?

256
00:17:23,105 --> 00:17:24,905
[Goddess] Injuries?

257
00:17:25,005 --> 00:17:27,405
[Konzen] They never told
me about any of this.

258
00:17:27,505 --> 00:17:31,338
[Goddess] Hmph. I'm sure they
didn't think it was worth
bothering you about.

259
00:17:31,438 --> 00:17:35,305
[Konzen] Why am I always the
last to know what's going on
inside the administration?

260
00:17:36,805 --> 00:17:38,238
It makes me sick!

261
00:17:39,405 --> 00:17:40,538
Oh, please.

262
00:17:42,071 --> 00:17:44,171
How long have you
been here anyway?

263
00:17:44,271 --> 00:17:48,371
You would think you'd figure out
that you only know what you
find out for yourself.

264
00:17:49,471 --> 00:17:51,605
[Crowds cheering loudly]

265
00:18:02,238 --> 00:18:04,338
[Goku] Nataku! Nataku!

266
00:18:05,438 --> 00:18:07,138
Over here!

267
00:18:07,238 --> 00:18:08,871
I'm really glad you're back!

268
00:18:09,771 --> 00:18:10,905
It's you!

269
00:18:16,438 --> 00:18:18,905
Nataku?! Nataku!

270
00:18:19,005 --> 00:18:21,471
It's me! Don't you remember?!

271
00:18:21,571 --> 00:18:23,038
I'm your friend!

272
00:18:23,138 --> 00:18:24,571
What's wrong with you?!

273
00:18:25,305 --> 00:18:27,205
Can't you see me?!

274
00:18:27,305 --> 00:18:28,438
Nataku!

275
00:18:29,371 --> 00:18:31,071
[Goddess] I wonder...

276
00:18:31,171 --> 00:18:33,171
Will you still be his sun?

277
00:19:27,113 --> 00:19:28,247
[Goku] Sanzo?

278
00:19:38,029 --> 00:19:39,362
What's the matter?

279
00:19:39,462 --> 00:19:41,495
Did you have a nightmare
or something?

280
00:19:48,929 --> 00:19:51,095
What's with me?

281
00:19:51,195 --> 00:19:52,829
It's so weird.

282
00:19:52,929 --> 00:19:54,595
I don't cry.

283
00:19:54,695 --> 00:19:56,495
What's all the tears for?

284
00:19:57,262 --> 00:19:59,295
I... caught us some fish.

285
00:20:00,295 --> 00:20:01,029
Huh?

286
00:20:01,129 --> 00:20:02,229
Real nice ones.

287
00:20:02,329 --> 00:20:04,229
I wanted to share
them with everyone,

288
00:20:04,329 --> 00:20:08,629
but you... but you wouldn't
wake up, so I guess I just...

289
00:20:10,362 --> 00:20:14,262
I just... wanted...
to eat them together.

290
00:20:14,362 --> 00:20:15,495
And I...!

291
00:20:17,062 --> 00:20:20,362
It's just dinner, man.
You're such an idiot.

292
00:20:21,195 --> 00:20:22,329
I know.

293
00:20:23,129 --> 00:20:24,262
[Sanzo] Let's go!

294
00:20:25,095 --> 00:20:26,229
Yeah!
