1
00:01:40,735 --> 00:01:42,002
[Ni] Ow...

2
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:44,402
[Wang] Did the old lady leave
claw marks on your back?

3
00:01:45,702 --> 00:01:47,368
Aren't you a sharp one?

4
00:01:47,468 --> 00:01:50,735
I can think of worst ways
to serve one's master.

5
00:01:52,402 --> 00:01:53,835
Disgusting.

6
00:01:53,935 --> 00:01:57,502
I can't imagine what Gyokumen
Koushu possibly sees in you.

7
00:01:59,668 --> 00:02:03,702
Do I detect a note of
jealously in your voice?

8
00:02:03,802 --> 00:02:07,035
You know, you could
always join us.

9
00:02:10,368 --> 00:02:12,702
[Ni] May I ask you something?

10
00:02:15,202 --> 00:02:19,202
Who's the one you're living for?

11
00:02:25,335 --> 00:02:27,735
[Goku] "Berserking
Towards Destruction"

12
00:02:50,768 --> 00:02:53,235
[Goku] Sanzo! Sanzo!

13
00:02:53,335 --> 00:02:56,302
Sanzo! Hang in there!
You hear me, Sanzo?!

14
00:02:56,402 --> 00:03:02,468
How.. could... I... not,
with you... screaming
in my ear like that.

15
00:03:04,035 --> 00:03:06,935
Dumb bitch! I've had just
about enough of your bullshit!

16
00:03:07,068 --> 00:03:08,968
You give us the goddamn
antidote now!

17
00:03:09,068 --> 00:03:11,302
[Renli] HA! In your dreams.

18
00:03:11,402 --> 00:03:13,202
I will kill you!

19
00:03:13,302 --> 00:03:14,868
As if you could.

20
00:03:14,968 --> 00:03:19,302
I've eaten a Sanzo,
remember? I'm immortal.

21
00:03:19,402 --> 00:03:20,602
You'll be dead.

22
00:03:22,568 --> 00:03:26,902
And now it's your turn
to taste my venom!

23
00:03:27,002 --> 00:03:28,135
[A gunshot rings out]

24
00:03:32,668 --> 00:03:36,668
No, th-that's impossible.
How could you kill me?!

25
00:03:36,768 --> 00:03:39,535
I'm an... an immortal!

26
00:03:42,768 --> 00:03:46,635
I swear, you guys need
so much looking after.

27
00:03:47,468 --> 00:03:48,902
[Goku] Sanzo!

28
00:03:49,002 --> 00:03:53,035
Calm down, he's
just unconscious.

29
00:03:53,135 --> 00:03:58,402
I'm afraid without the scorpion
woman here, finding an antidote
won't be an easy task.

30
00:03:58,502 --> 00:04:03,468
"You can't kill me, I'm
immortal." Stupid slut.

31
00:04:03,568 --> 00:04:05,435
If nothing else, it looks
like we might have laid that

32
00:04:05,535 --> 00:04:08,868
old immortality
fairytale to rest.

33
00:04:15,335 --> 00:04:18,168
You don't think...

34
00:04:18,268 --> 00:04:20,435
he's going to go
berserk again, do you?

35
00:04:24,402 --> 00:04:28,168
This is an awfully similiar
situation to the day we
fought with Rikudo.

36
00:04:29,035 --> 00:04:30,168
Goku...

37
00:04:34,202 --> 00:04:35,435
Hakkai, what...

38
00:04:37,868 --> 00:04:42,068
should we do? What can any
of us do to save Sanzo's life?

39
00:04:45,502 --> 00:04:50,202
Don't you remember what Sanzo
said about us? He told us
that we wouldn't die.

40
00:04:50,302 --> 00:04:54,068
We should be careful not to
do anything too wreckless.

41
00:04:54,168 --> 00:04:57,735
So that we can see this
mission through to the end.

42
00:04:57,835 --> 00:05:01,135
You're right, yes. Be strong.

43
00:05:04,302 --> 00:05:08,968
I'm not about ready to
give up hope. Don't worry,

44
00:05:09,068 --> 00:05:13,468
[Hakkai] Sanzo has never
been the type to die easily.
[Goku] Yeah.

45
00:05:13,568 --> 00:05:17,402
Right now, we should be
worrying about how to get
back up to the surface.

46
00:05:17,502 --> 00:05:20,435
You're right. We should try
heading back to the village.

47
00:05:20,568 --> 00:05:23,735
They would probably have some
serum there. I'm sure scorpion

48
00:05:23,835 --> 00:05:26,735
bites are very common in
the desert area like this,

49
00:05:26,835 --> 00:05:29,168
and they're bound to
have something on hand.

50
00:05:29,268 --> 00:05:33,935
But how are we going to find
an exit if we don't even know
how we got in this stupid place?

51
00:05:48,302 --> 00:05:49,735
Guys, what's going on?!

52
00:05:49,835 --> 00:05:52,768
It sounded like something big
collapsed in the tunnels!

53
00:05:52,868 --> 00:05:54,068
No, it can't be...

54
00:05:54,802 --> 00:05:57,035
We're underground, right?

55
00:05:57,135 --> 00:05:59,235
[Both] Uh huh, so?

56
00:05:59,335 --> 00:06:02,868
And do you remember we
broke ourselves out of
the prison just now?

57
00:06:02,968 --> 00:06:05,568
[Both] By breaking
through the wall?

58
00:06:05,668 --> 00:06:09,402
And if the central wall
to an underground passage
were destroyed,

59
00:06:09,502 --> 00:06:11,002
what do you think would happen?

60
00:06:11,102 --> 00:06:12,302
Don't know.

61
00:06:12,402 --> 00:06:15,102
I guess the weight of the
desert above might collaspe-

62
00:06:19,035 --> 00:06:22,068
A fine time... to
tell me these things!

63
00:06:22,168 --> 00:06:25,168
[Hakkai] And if you'll remember,
I was against it all along.

64
00:06:28,235 --> 00:06:33,368
Well, we can't go out that
way. I'd say our options are
starting to look pretty thin.

65
00:06:33,468 --> 00:06:36,668
Did any of you see a ventilation
duct or something we can
climb through?

66
00:06:40,368 --> 00:06:42,735
<i>[Hakkai] That's right!</i>
<i>I'd forgotten!</i>

67
00:06:42,835 --> 00:06:45,268
[Gojyo] Where the hell do
you think you're going?

68
00:06:45,368 --> 00:06:46,902
[Hakkai] The Scriptures!

69
00:06:47,002 --> 00:06:49,102
[Hakkai] There was a Maten
Scripture, and then there was

70
00:06:49,202 --> 00:06:52,235
the Scripture carried
by the other Sanzo.

71
00:06:52,335 --> 00:06:56,235
<i>[Hakkai] Bingo! Dammit,</i>
<i>it's the Maten Scripture.</i>

72
00:06:59,935 --> 00:07:02,135
Uh, excuse me gentlemen...

73
00:07:02,235 --> 00:07:04,302
The ceiling starting to cave in!

74
00:07:04,402 --> 00:07:05,868
[Hakkai] Gojyo,
hold this for me!

75
00:07:09,268 --> 00:07:10,402
[Goku] What the-?!

76
00:07:22,768 --> 00:07:24,268
What the-?

77
00:07:25,268 --> 00:07:26,835
[Goku] Hakkai!

78
00:07:26,935 --> 00:07:30,635
I'm afraid I can only shield
us from above, so please be

79
00:07:30,735 --> 00:07:33,268
careful that you don't
get buried from below!

80
00:07:33,368 --> 00:07:34,935
But what about you?

81
00:07:36,835 --> 00:07:38,935
You're gonna be buried alive!

82
00:08:00,402 --> 00:08:02,968
<i>[Gojyo] Crap! Of all the</i>
<i>things, I never thought</i>

83
00:08:03,068 --> 00:08:06,202
<i>sand would be what did</i>
<i>me in. How lame is that?</i>

84
00:08:11,102 --> 00:08:13,668
Just give it up, Hakkai! You're
going to wind up giving yourself

85
00:08:13,768 --> 00:08:16,068
an aneurism if keep fighting
against it like that!

86
00:08:16,168 --> 00:08:20,468
I'd choose that over
getting buired alive
in this place anyday!

87
00:08:23,135 --> 00:08:24,968
[Hakkai] I can't hold it!

88
00:08:25,535 --> 00:08:27,035
[Gojyo] Crap!

89
00:08:45,735 --> 00:08:46,935
[Hakkai] A wind-like fire?

90
00:08:57,302 --> 00:08:58,902
[Goku] It... it stopped.

91
00:08:59,002 --> 00:09:00,135
[Gojyo] Is everyone okay?

92
00:09:02,935 --> 00:09:04,735
[Hakkai] What the hell
just happened in there?

93
00:09:06,735 --> 00:09:07,902
[Hakuryu squeaks pitifully]

94
00:09:09,035 --> 00:09:10,668
[Hakkai] Hakuryu!

95
00:09:13,602 --> 00:09:17,202
Were you waiting here all
this time, little fella?

96
00:09:17,302 --> 00:09:20,702
Alone in the scorching hot
sun? You're a real trooper.

97
00:09:25,235 --> 00:09:29,002
He looks awfully weak.
In this condition, I...

98
00:09:29,102 --> 00:09:33,735
Yes, I doubt he'd be
able to carry us anywhere
when he's like this.

99
00:09:33,835 --> 00:09:37,368
But... what about-?

100
00:09:37,468 --> 00:09:38,902
What about Sanzo?!

101
00:09:43,002 --> 00:09:44,835
[Gojyo] Hakkai!

102
00:09:44,935 --> 00:09:48,535
Next time don't go pulling
those kinds of heroics
to show off, hear me?

103
00:09:50,102 --> 00:09:51,235
I'm sorry.

104
00:09:54,435 --> 00:09:56,802
It just makes me
feel so pathetic.

105
00:09:59,402 --> 00:10:00,568
<i>Gojyo...</i>

106
00:10:01,635 --> 00:10:03,402
[Kougaiji] I should have
know it was you clowns.

107
00:10:03,502 --> 00:10:04,635
[All] Huh?!

108
00:10:08,535 --> 00:10:09,668
[Goku] Kougaiji!

109
00:10:25,869 --> 00:10:29,089
I'd say, you never know
who's going to change.

110
00:10:29,089 --> 00:10:32,055
Take Goku, for instance.

111
00:10:32,155 --> 00:10:35,322
When the boy was brought before
us five hundred years ago,

112
00:10:35,422 --> 00:10:37,689
he was nothing more
than a monkey.

113
00:10:37,789 --> 00:10:39,922
But now look at him.

114
00:10:42,722 --> 00:10:46,989
[Goddess] That's what
makes living creatures so
fascinating, don't you think?

115
00:10:47,089 --> 00:10:48,689
It is.

116
00:10:48,789 --> 00:10:52,889
Things that are incapable of
change, are... just so boring.

117
00:10:52,989 --> 00:10:57,422
Then again, I believe
I've said all this before.

118
00:11:00,555 --> 00:11:01,689
Kougaiji!

119
00:11:04,855 --> 00:11:09,389
Tell me. What brings you guys
all the way out here, hm?

120
00:11:09,489 --> 00:11:12,855
Am I right to assume those
fireworks were your doing?

121
00:11:14,655 --> 00:11:17,022
[Goku] That was
you guys? Thanks.

122
00:11:17,122 --> 00:11:21,222
[Kougaiji] Don't get all
mushy on me. I was just
passing through.

123
00:11:21,322 --> 00:11:24,322
[Goku] Oh, that's right! I
forgot! Sanzo's been poisoned

124
00:11:24,422 --> 00:11:26,622
by a scorpion lady, and
you've gotta help us!

125
00:11:26,722 --> 00:11:27,955
You don't say.

126
00:11:28,055 --> 00:11:31,422
Isn't that apothecary chick of
yours around here somewhere?

127
00:11:31,555 --> 00:11:33,789
Yaone won't be joining us today.

128
00:11:33,889 --> 00:11:37,122
So you guys ran into the
demon lady of the desert?

129
00:11:37,222 --> 00:11:39,555
Yeah, but I'm afraid
we had to kill her.

130
00:11:39,655 --> 00:11:42,255
Hey, that demon was suppose
to have one of the Founding

131
00:11:42,355 --> 00:11:44,922
Scriptures of Heaven and
Earth on her, you know.

132
00:11:45,022 --> 00:11:47,422
Well then, the bitch shouldn't
have gone and pissed us off.

133
00:11:47,522 --> 00:11:52,122
And if it's the Scriptures
your after, then I'm afraid
they're buried under....

134
00:11:52,222 --> 00:11:54,022
...a hundred tons of sand.

135
00:11:54,689 --> 00:11:56,955
Better start digging now.

136
00:11:57,055 --> 00:12:00,355
[Hakkai] We were able to
recover the Maten Scripture.

137
00:12:00,455 --> 00:12:05,255
<i>[Kougaiji] Just my luck.</i>
<i>The second I'm assigned</i>
<i>to hunt down Scriptures,</i>

138
00:12:05,389 --> 00:12:10,889
<i>I run into these guys, only</i>
<i>to find out they went and</i>
<i>buried it beneath the desert..</i>

139
00:12:12,022 --> 00:12:15,789
<i>Then again. There's</i>
<i>is another Scripture.</i>

140
00:12:26,522 --> 00:12:29,222
Just what do you think
you're doing, huh?

141
00:12:29,322 --> 00:12:31,089
[Goku] I'm carrying
Sanzo to safety.

142
00:12:31,189 --> 00:12:36,322
Are you nuts? Just how far do
you think you'll get in this
desert heat? Think about it.

143
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:38,922
What choice do I have?

144
00:12:39,022 --> 00:12:40,622
We're stuck in the middle
of the desert...

145
00:12:40,722 --> 00:12:44,955
And Hakuryu's no use.
There's no time!

146
00:12:45,055 --> 00:12:46,355
I won't let Sanzo die!

147
00:12:50,422 --> 00:12:52,289
[Ni] Precious to you...

148
00:12:52,389 --> 00:12:55,789
You should never let go
of what's precious to you.

149
00:13:03,455 --> 00:13:07,289
<i>[Kougaiji] Yeah, I hear</i>
<i>ya. Stupid quack.</i>

150
00:13:08,589 --> 00:13:10,922
<i>Too late to go back now.</i>

151
00:13:13,389 --> 00:13:14,955
Hold up, Goku.

152
00:13:16,122 --> 00:13:20,355
I just happen to have a
flying dragon parked near by.

153
00:13:20,455 --> 00:13:24,455
And I'd be more than
happy to let you borrow
it, on one condition.

154
00:13:25,289 --> 00:13:27,555
You have to kill ME first.

155
00:13:27,655 --> 00:13:31,689
Here's the deal. If we win,
we get the Maten Scripture.

156
00:13:35,655 --> 00:13:39,122
If you win, the dragon's
yours. No questions asked.

157
00:13:39,222 --> 00:13:42,955
Now let's finish this
little rivalry of ours
once and for all.

158
00:13:44,589 --> 00:13:46,555
So do we have a deal?

159
00:14:05,722 --> 00:14:07,389
What's with you?

160
00:14:07,489 --> 00:14:09,789
You're acting... crazy!

161
00:14:10,589 --> 00:14:12,055
Why are you doing this?!

162
00:14:12,855 --> 00:14:14,655
Goku, look out!

163
00:14:24,955 --> 00:14:26,955
What's the hang up?

164
00:14:27,055 --> 00:14:28,755
[Goku] I won't do it.

165
00:14:28,855 --> 00:14:30,522
Let's get this straight.

166
00:14:30,622 --> 00:14:32,889
You and I are... enemies.

167
00:14:32,989 --> 00:14:34,122
Wha-?

168
00:14:38,755 --> 00:14:39,855
If you've got no stomach
for a fight, little man,

169
00:14:39,955 --> 00:14:41,522
then I'll just take
the Scripture.

170
00:14:47,955 --> 00:14:49,822
[Goku] Don't you
lay a hand on him!

171
00:14:53,089 --> 00:14:55,122
[Goku] Is he alright?!

172
00:14:55,222 --> 00:15:00,722
Goku, why don't you just let
me worry about Sanzo, okay?

173
00:15:00,822 --> 00:15:02,355
Whatever it is Kougaiji
is fighting for, I know

174
00:15:02,455 --> 00:15:07,689
he is not going to back down,
no matter what you say to him.

175
00:15:08,922 --> 00:15:11,789
I don't know what it is
they're holding over him,

176
00:15:11,889 --> 00:15:16,389
but I'm sure you understand
what it means to fear losing
something close to you.

177
00:15:20,489 --> 00:15:23,555
[Dokugakuji] Kougaiji, are you
sure that you want to do this?

178
00:15:24,855 --> 00:15:27,189
I have no room for
regrets, my friend.

179
00:15:29,489 --> 00:15:33,689
Okay. Then I won't
stop you either.

180
00:15:35,122 --> 00:15:36,255
What the hell?!

181
00:15:40,555 --> 00:15:44,589
Stop ignoring me, brother,
and lets get this show
on the road, alright?

182
00:15:45,989 --> 00:15:47,655
I'm feeling neglected.

183
00:15:49,755 --> 00:15:52,355
[Dokugakuji] You always wanted
to be the center of attention.

184
00:15:53,455 --> 00:15:55,922
How about it, big brother?

185
00:15:56,022 --> 00:15:58,489
Let's spar... like old times!

186
00:16:01,489 --> 00:16:04,522
I'll take care of
this one, Kougaiji!

187
00:16:26,655 --> 00:16:28,422
Hey, Hakkai.

188
00:16:29,755 --> 00:16:31,722
Will you stop once...
once it starts?

189
00:16:32,389 --> 00:16:34,289
Goku, you're not...

190
00:16:34,389 --> 00:16:36,722
I... can't kill him like...

191
00:16:36,822 --> 00:16:40,022
I am... I just can't, but...

192
00:16:41,355 --> 00:16:43,689
But I can't lose either, so...

193
00:16:47,955 --> 00:16:49,422
I'm counting on you.

194
00:16:51,689 --> 00:16:53,322
What the hell?!

195
00:16:53,422 --> 00:16:55,522
That stupid monkey!

196
00:17:18,336 --> 00:17:23,236
[Goku] He's the one who saved me
from the prison of darkness...

197
00:17:23,236 --> 00:17:28,002
And the one who showed
me the light of the world,
far brighter than the sun.

198
00:17:29,469 --> 00:17:32,469
Why is it that I remember
everything so clearly?

199
00:17:34,902 --> 00:17:36,569
I have...

200
00:17:36,669 --> 00:17:38,602
this feeling...

201
00:17:38,702 --> 00:17:43,936
...that's stayed with me from
a time... long, long ago.

202
00:17:45,469 --> 00:17:47,802
I just want to hold onto it!

203
00:18:00,769 --> 00:18:01,902
Could this...

204
00:18:06,336 --> 00:18:07,969
...be his... true form?

205
00:18:11,736 --> 00:18:12,936
It's Son Goku!

206
00:18:14,302 --> 00:18:15,536
Wh-where'd he go?!

207
00:18:22,869 --> 00:18:24,836
What the hell was that?!

208
00:18:24,936 --> 00:18:29,402
He must've moved so fast that
it looked like he vanished.

209
00:18:32,169 --> 00:18:33,802
There's no way...

210
00:18:33,902 --> 00:18:37,202
<i>I stand a chance fighting</i>
<i>against that thing.</i>

211
00:18:37,302 --> 00:18:38,669
<i>He's just too fast!</i>

212
00:18:39,869 --> 00:18:42,502
<i>Let's see if he's</i>
<i>fast enough...</i>

213
00:18:42,602 --> 00:18:47,002
<i>...to dodge this!</i>

214
00:18:47,102 --> 00:18:50,369
Spirit of the desert, as weather
broke you down from rock to

215
00:18:50,469 --> 00:18:54,169
sand, I call upon your old
strength. Hear my voice!

216
00:18:54,269 --> 00:18:57,902
Rise up, fiend, and do
your work on my enemy!

217
00:18:58,936 --> 00:19:00,069
RISE!

218
00:19:23,302 --> 00:19:24,436
[Gojyo & Hakkai] Goku!

219
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:33,602
<i>[Kougaiji] He banished</i>
<i>the fiend I summoned?!</i>

220
00:19:48,902 --> 00:19:50,036
Oh shit!

221
00:19:51,769 --> 00:19:52,902
I'll say.

222
00:20:01,336 --> 00:20:03,636
He doesn't seem to
act like he's fighting.

223
00:20:04,736 --> 00:20:07,836
It's like... he's
really enjoying it.

224
00:20:12,569 --> 00:20:14,136
I wonder...

225
00:20:16,236 --> 00:20:18,536
What would you say, Sanzo...

226
00:20:18,636 --> 00:20:20,002
...if you could see this?

227
00:20:29,402 --> 00:20:31,236
[Huang] Who am I living for?

228
00:20:32,402 --> 00:20:35,969
[Ni] I can answer the question
for you, if you like.

229
00:20:36,069 --> 00:20:41,069
Everyone tries to claim they're
living someone else's sake,

230
00:20:41,169 --> 00:20:45,969
but the truth is, everyone's
just really looking out for...

231
00:20:46,069 --> 00:20:47,202
...themselves.

232
00:22:30,136 --> 00:22:32,258
[Goku] What's happening to me?

233
00:22:32,258 --> 00:22:34,892
I feel like I'm split in two!

234
00:22:34,992 --> 00:22:37,192
It's like there's someone
else living inside me of
me that I can't control!

235
00:22:37,292 --> 00:22:41,592
My mind's telling me I
don't want to hurt anyone,

236
00:22:41,692 --> 00:22:43,958
yet all my body wants
to do is kill!

237
00:22:44,058 --> 00:22:46,225
Will somebody please stop me?!

238
00:22:46,325 --> 00:22:48,125
There's no telling what I'll do!

239
00:22:48,225 --> 00:22:52,658
Next time on Saiyuki,
"The Battle Ends".
