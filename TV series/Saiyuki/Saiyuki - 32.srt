1
00:01:38,768 --> 00:01:40,588
[Hakkai] What's with
everyone today?

2
00:01:40,588 --> 00:01:42,721
I don't think I've ever
seen you so quiet.

3
00:01:42,821 --> 00:01:46,188
[Gojyo] Come on, we've had our
share of downtimes, haven't we?

4
00:01:46,288 --> 00:01:48,221
[Hakkai] If you've suddenly
decided to play the part

5
00:01:48,321 --> 00:01:51,021
of the brooding artist,
it doesn't suit you.

6
00:01:51,121 --> 00:01:54,321
[Gojyo] Stop it. You're making
me feel all fuzzy inside.

7
00:01:54,421 --> 00:01:58,121
[Hakkai] You know, if
you insist on keeping this
somber attitude of yours,

8
00:01:58,221 --> 00:02:00,588
that neighbor of yours
is going to get bored.

9
00:02:00,688 --> 00:02:02,654
Isn't that right, Goku?

10
00:02:02,754 --> 00:02:03,488
Goku?

11
00:02:03,588 --> 00:02:04,888
What's wrong?

12
00:02:04,988 --> 00:02:06,954
You eat something that
didn't agree with you?

13
00:02:14,021 --> 00:02:15,988
I'll be damned...

14
00:02:16,088 --> 00:02:18,454
He's sleeping with
his eyes open.

15
00:02:19,654 --> 00:02:22,154
That's just too goddamn creepy!

16
00:02:22,254 --> 00:02:23,854
[Sanzo] Shut up
or I'll kill you!

17
00:02:28,721 --> 00:02:30,388
That's too weird.

18
00:02:30,488 --> 00:02:32,521
Sanzo shouts in his sleep.

19
00:02:44,954 --> 00:02:46,954
[Goku] "The Real Imposters."

20
00:02:51,688 --> 00:02:54,488
[Fake Sanzo] Welcome!
How would you like to
try some tasty noodles?

21
00:02:54,588 --> 00:02:56,488
[Customer 1] Oh, great!
Uh, three orders please!

22
00:02:56,588 --> 00:02:58,888
[Fake Hakkai] Thanks for
waiting. Would you like
some stir fried cabbage?

23
00:02:58,988 --> 00:03:01,221
[Customer 2] Oh that sounds
good. Let me have two orders
of that on the side.

24
00:03:01,321 --> 00:03:02,688
[Fake Sanzo] Thank you!
Please come again!

25
00:03:02,788 --> 00:03:03,954
Welcome, welcome!

26
00:03:04,054 --> 00:03:05,721
Thank you! Be with you in a sec!

27
00:03:05,821 --> 00:03:07,454
Uuh, what would you like?

28
00:03:15,321 --> 00:03:18,288
So how long have we been here?

29
00:03:18,388 --> 00:03:20,254
Three months now?

30
00:03:20,354 --> 00:03:23,188
Yeah. Two months and
twenty-seven days since

31
00:03:23,288 --> 00:03:25,688
you and I started
this stupid job.

32
00:03:27,588 --> 00:03:32,588
Can you believe it's
been that long since we
impersonated the Sanzo party?

33
00:03:32,688 --> 00:03:34,588
Do you remember that?

34
00:03:39,988 --> 00:03:43,321
[Fake Sanzo] Running into
the real Sanzo party was
especially horrible.

35
00:03:45,621 --> 00:03:49,321
[Fake Hakkai] Yeah, it's
a miracle we're alive.

36
00:03:57,321 --> 00:04:01,254
But now, you and I
are working real jobs.

37
00:04:01,354 --> 00:04:04,488
Aren't we the luckiest
guys in the whole world?

38
00:04:04,588 --> 00:04:08,188
Nothing can beat a good day's
hard, honest labor, can it?

39
00:04:08,288 --> 00:04:11,354
You know, you and I did some
reckless things in our day.

40
00:04:11,454 --> 00:04:14,854
It's kinda hard to believe
how much we've settled down.

41
00:04:17,388 --> 00:04:19,354
[Goku] Excuse me!

42
00:04:19,454 --> 00:04:21,854
Four noodles, please.
Make it quick!

43
00:04:21,954 --> 00:04:23,421
Yes, right away, sir!

44
00:04:26,188 --> 00:04:27,554
What's your problem?

45
00:04:31,421 --> 00:04:33,588
[Fake Sanzo] I could
never forget those faces!

46
00:04:33,688 --> 00:04:36,221
[Fake Hakkai] They've come
back to finish the job!

47
00:04:36,321 --> 00:04:37,988
[Fake Sanzo] Please
don't kill us!

48
00:04:38,088 --> 00:04:40,688
[Fake Hakkai] We make an
honest living now! Honest!

49
00:04:41,754 --> 00:04:43,888
They're sure acting strangely.

50
00:04:43,988 --> 00:04:46,854
I wonder what has
them so spooked.

51
00:04:46,988 --> 00:04:50,388
Excuse me, but I believe you are
supposed to great your guest.

52
00:04:50,488 --> 00:04:51,288
Am I right?

53
00:04:51,388 --> 00:04:53,021
[Both Fakes] O-of course!

54
00:04:53,121 --> 00:04:56,188
Hey. You don't think
they... don't know...

55
00:04:56,288 --> 00:04:58,921
Who we are? I hope not.

56
00:04:59,021 --> 00:05:00,488
Fried noodles! Right now!

57
00:05:00,588 --> 00:05:02,021
[Both Fakes] Right!

58
00:05:02,121 --> 00:05:03,921
It's yours! Free!

59
00:05:06,221 --> 00:05:08,954
[Gojyo] Hey.
[Fake Sanzo] Y-yes?

60
00:05:09,054 --> 00:05:13,521
[Gojyo] You're not planning
to serve us those reheated
noodles, right?

61
00:05:21,488 --> 00:05:27,421
You're not really planning
to serve us these reheated
noodles, am I right?

62
00:05:27,521 --> 00:05:31,821
[Fake Sanzo] Uh, wh-what are you
talking about? I made these just
a moment ago. Honestly!

63
00:05:31,921 --> 00:05:35,588
[Gojyo] You're not planning
to serve us these reheated
noodles, right?!

64
00:05:36,721 --> 00:05:40,154
No way! L-look here!
A fresh batch! Right?

65
00:05:40,254 --> 00:05:41,521
Ah-huh, ah-huh!

66
00:05:41,621 --> 00:05:44,321
I-I was just moving those
boxes to make room, honest!

67
00:05:44,421 --> 00:05:46,788
[Goku] Oh, I want
an extra serving!

68
00:05:46,888 --> 00:05:49,721
[Gojyo] And make the noodles
a bit on the firm side.

69
00:05:49,821 --> 00:05:52,388
[Hakkai] And go heavy
on the wasabi, please!

70
00:05:52,488 --> 00:05:54,954
[Sanzo] I don't care how you
make them, just hurry up!

71
00:05:58,388 --> 00:06:00,954
[Fake Hakkai] H-here you
go. Thanks for waiting!

72
00:06:01,054 --> 00:06:03,988
Noodles, noodles, noodles!

73
00:06:04,088 --> 00:06:06,954
Thanks, I'm so glad you like
them. Please come again.

74
00:06:09,188 --> 00:06:11,221
[Sanzo] Hey.
[Fake Hakkai] Yes, Sir?

75
00:06:11,321 --> 00:06:12,688
I am assuming...

76
00:06:12,788 --> 00:06:14,321
ginger comes with that?

77
00:06:16,154 --> 00:06:18,021
[Goku] This isn't bad!
[Gojyo] Can't you wait

78
00:06:18,121 --> 00:06:19,954
[Gojyo] until we get back
before you start eating?

79
00:06:20,054 --> 00:06:21,388
[Goku] I can eat when I want to!

80
00:06:21,488 --> 00:06:23,188
[Gojyo] Doesn't make
you any less stupid.

81
00:06:24,321 --> 00:06:25,654
Safe at last.

82
00:06:26,788 --> 00:06:29,021
We can both relax now.

83
00:06:29,121 --> 00:06:31,021
It looks like they're leaving.

84
00:06:35,854 --> 00:06:39,588
I can't believe the absolutely
incredible deal I found on
fajita skirt steak.

85
00:06:39,688 --> 00:06:42,021
I think the guys're gonna be
really excited about it.

86
00:06:43,888 --> 00:06:45,821
Hey, jackass! Look
where you're going!

87
00:06:45,921 --> 00:06:48,688
I'm sorry! I hope you're
not hurt or anything.

88
00:06:50,721 --> 00:06:53,021
Oops, looks like
you dropped this.

89
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:56,288
Here you go. You need any
help carrying them home?

90
00:06:56,388 --> 00:06:59,088
Ah... ah.... ah... ah...

91
00:07:04,554 --> 00:07:06,654
What's with that guy?

92
00:07:06,754 --> 00:07:09,388
Uh, well. I'm not sure.

93
00:07:13,688 --> 00:07:15,854
[Fake Goku] So, doing
anything later?

94
00:07:15,954 --> 00:07:18,021
Whaddya say we go out tonight?

95
00:07:18,121 --> 00:07:20,321
[Lady] Sorry, I have plans.

96
00:07:20,421 --> 00:07:23,688
In that case, how
about tomorrow?

97
00:07:23,788 --> 00:07:26,221
[Lady] I'm sorry, I don't think
you heard me the first time.

98
00:07:26,321 --> 00:07:27,721
I have plans.

99
00:07:27,821 --> 00:07:30,788
There must be some
time that you're free.

100
00:07:30,888 --> 00:07:34,988
[Lady] Why don't you put some of
that energy into actually doing
some work around here?

101
00:07:35,088 --> 00:07:38,754
What's the point? No one ever
checks into this place. Huh?!

102
00:07:38,854 --> 00:07:40,488
Hey! Any rooms?

103
00:07:40,588 --> 00:07:41,854
[Lady] Sure do!

104
00:07:41,954 --> 00:07:44,321
Can you show these
four gentlemen...

105
00:07:44,421 --> 00:07:45,554
Hello?

106
00:07:47,321 --> 00:07:49,054
Now where did he run off to?

107
00:07:50,154 --> 00:07:52,521
Looks like I'll be
registering you today.

108
00:07:52,621 --> 00:07:55,021
If you could, just sign
here in the guestbook.

109
00:07:58,388 --> 00:08:01,454
What are they doing here?

110
00:08:03,654 --> 00:08:07,321
[Fake Sanzo is throwing a
fit, while Fake Hakkai and
Fake Gojyo try to restrain him]

111
00:08:11,588 --> 00:08:13,554
What the hell's
going on in here?!

112
00:08:13,654 --> 00:08:15,854
Well it's about damn
time you got back!

113
00:08:15,954 --> 00:08:17,288
Get your ass over here!

114
00:08:17,388 --> 00:08:20,854
They're back! They've come
back! Please don't hurt me!

115
00:08:20,954 --> 00:08:24,254
[Fake Goku] Don't tell me
you saw the four horsemen
of the apocalypse!

116
00:08:24,354 --> 00:08:25,954
[Fake Gojyo] You saw them too?!

117
00:08:26,054 --> 00:08:30,621
Please don't hurt me. Why
are you doing this to me?

118
00:08:30,721 --> 00:08:33,688
I must have done something
terribly, terribly wrong.

119
00:08:33,788 --> 00:08:35,554
Is it because I'm worthless?

120
00:08:35,654 --> 00:08:37,788
That's it. That's
the reason for it.

121
00:08:37,888 --> 00:08:41,821
They forced him to make
fried noodles and they
didn't even pay.

122
00:08:41,921 --> 00:08:44,121
You should have been
there, it was awful.

123
00:08:44,221 --> 00:08:47,288
Poor guy. I guess it was
just too much for him to
handle. He just snapped.

124
00:08:47,388 --> 00:08:52,188
I haven't seen anybody lose
it like this since my brother
told my mother he was gay.

125
00:08:52,288 --> 00:08:55,788
[Fake Hakkai] I'm not sure
I could ever cook again
if they did that to me.

126
00:08:55,888 --> 00:08:57,821
[Fake Gojyo] Listen you
guys, I've been thinking.

127
00:08:57,921 --> 00:09:00,854
It's probably a good idea to
lay low for a couple of days.

128
00:09:00,954 --> 00:09:03,688
[Fake Hakkai] Yeah, there's
no point in tempting fate.

129
00:09:06,054 --> 00:09:09,121
I can't believe you!

130
00:09:09,221 --> 00:09:12,054
Don't tell me you're gonna
let them get away with this!

131
00:09:12,154 --> 00:09:13,788
We have no choice.

132
00:09:13,921 --> 00:09:16,321
What would you have us
do? Fight them head on?

133
00:09:16,421 --> 00:09:17,721
We'll get our asses kicked.

134
00:09:17,821 --> 00:09:20,354
There's no way in hell
we could ever beat them.

135
00:09:20,454 --> 00:09:24,888
What is this?! Don't you
guys have any self-esteem?!

136
00:09:24,988 --> 00:09:28,688
Once upon a time, the four of
us were a first rate imposters!

137
00:09:28,788 --> 00:09:30,421
Now look what we've become!

138
00:09:30,521 --> 00:09:34,788
A bunch of sniveling
dead beat, self-pitying
losers, that's what!

139
00:09:34,888 --> 00:09:36,954
They're too strong...

140
00:09:37,054 --> 00:09:39,021
You can count me out...

141
00:09:39,121 --> 00:09:41,254
I can't...

142
00:09:41,354 --> 00:09:43,054
[Fake Goku] Okay, fine.

143
00:09:46,721 --> 00:09:49,121
If that's the way you're
going to be about it...

144
00:10:01,721 --> 00:10:03,454
I'll do it by myself.

145
00:10:21,429 --> 00:10:23,690
This rice is absolutely awesome!

146
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:26,790
The soup was good, but the
noodles are just pure heaven!

147
00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:28,023
This meal's the best!

148
00:10:28,123 --> 00:10:30,290
How would I know? You pig.

149
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:35,056
You gobbled up every single
one of the dishes before
I got to try any of them.

150
00:10:38,023 --> 00:10:41,156
Fine, don't talk to me. I didn't
want to talk to you anyway.

151
00:10:41,256 --> 00:10:42,923
[Gojoy] Hey, gimme
back my dumpling!

152
00:10:43,023 --> 00:10:45,223
[Gojyo] If you got the noodles,
then I get the dumplings!

153
00:10:45,323 --> 00:10:49,490
[Goku[ No way! I was saving
them for last! Hand them over!
You thieving water sprite!

154
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:51,923
[Gojyo] If you want it so
bad, why don't you come
over here and take it!

155
00:10:52,023 --> 00:10:55,256
[Goku] Okay, I will!
EW, gross! You licked it!

156
00:10:55,356 --> 00:10:56,223
[Gojyo] Still want it?

157
00:10:56,323 --> 00:10:57,290
[Goku spits on the dumplings]

158
00:10:57,423 --> 00:10:58,223
[Goku] There, now
it's all yours!

159
00:10:58,323 --> 00:10:59,323
[Gojyo] You spit
on my dumplings!

160
00:10:59,423 --> 00:11:00,823
[Goku] Now neither
of us get any!

161
00:11:00,923 --> 00:11:02,356
[Gojyo] Great. Now we paid
all that money for nothing!

162
00:11:02,456 --> 00:11:03,956
I'm so worthless.

163
00:11:05,256 --> 00:11:07,356
How about I shove it
down your throat?!

164
00:11:07,456 --> 00:11:09,256
[Goku] Might be difficult
with my staff up your ass!

165
00:11:09,356 --> 00:11:11,156
[Sanzo] Do you wanna see
what it's like to die?!

166
00:11:11,256 --> 00:11:12,790
I'll pass on that one.

167
00:11:14,223 --> 00:11:15,356
[Sanzo] What's wrong?

168
00:11:15,456 --> 00:11:18,190
Huh? Oh. Nothing.

169
00:11:19,756 --> 00:11:23,356
<i>Where have I seen</i>
<i>those guys before?</i>

170
00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:42,623
How strange. The sky
seems so enormous today.

171
00:11:48,756 --> 00:11:51,556
Why does this town
seem so surreal?

172
00:11:56,090 --> 00:12:01,390
I work and I work, but what
do I have to show for it?

173
00:12:03,656 --> 00:12:06,723
Life sure was easier back then.

174
00:12:13,856 --> 00:12:16,723
My goodness. Sure
brings me back.

175
00:12:22,423 --> 00:12:25,390
[All chatting away]

176
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:34,590
[Fake Sanzo] Get it away!
Get it away! I hate frogs!

177
00:12:35,923 --> 00:12:38,290
[The frog croaks]

178
00:12:38,423 --> 00:12:41,723
I hereby give blessings
on all you good people.

179
00:13:15,923 --> 00:13:20,390
Oh boy. I told myself
I'd never do this again.

180
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:32,690
Okay then...

181
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:34,990
At least I'll go out
with a little...

182
00:13:35,090 --> 00:13:37,390
pizzazz. A little style.

183
00:13:37,823 --> 00:13:38,956
Yeah.

184
00:13:54,323 --> 00:13:57,490
Look here, if it isn't
the big show off.

185
00:14:06,490 --> 00:14:07,623
What's up, man?

186
00:14:08,223 --> 00:14:09,390
Gojyo!

187
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:11,623
[Fake Hakkai] I couldn't have
you forgetting about me.

188
00:14:13,423 --> 00:14:16,623
Mmmm. Tasty.

189
00:14:16,723 --> 00:14:18,556
Hakkai...

190
00:14:18,656 --> 00:14:20,356
[Fake Sanzo] Looks
like everyone's here.

191
00:14:20,456 --> 00:14:22,256
I have to be honest
just a little.

192
00:14:22,356 --> 00:14:25,523
Been so long, I'd almost
forgot how to wear these.

193
00:14:25,623 --> 00:14:27,990
Sa-Sanzo?!

194
00:14:32,690 --> 00:14:34,556
Hey, hey, hey. Don't cry.

195
00:14:36,456 --> 00:14:38,723
It seems we're just not
comfortable as ourselves,

196
00:14:38,823 --> 00:14:41,290
unless we're posing
as someone we're not.

197
00:14:41,390 --> 00:14:44,456
[Fake Hakkai] Let's go and show
them who the real imposters are!

198
00:14:44,556 --> 00:14:46,023
Let me speak!

199
00:14:46,823 --> 00:14:49,490
I know... now that it...

200
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:54,790
it would have been a suicidal
mission to go up against them
and face them alone.

201
00:14:54,890 --> 00:14:58,556
But I know together.. that
we can find a way to defeat

202
00:14:58,656 --> 00:15:01,723
those self-righteous bastards.

203
00:15:01,823 --> 00:15:04,423
Listen, I have an idea.

204
00:15:10,423 --> 00:15:13,390
Yanno, it's just crazy
enough to work.

205
00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:16,156
I really think you're
onto something there.

206
00:15:16,256 --> 00:15:19,556
And then what we do
for the grand finale...

207
00:15:19,656 --> 00:15:22,390
It's a completely airtight
plan, if ya ask me.

208
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:24,090
[Fake Goku] Everyone,
take your positions!

209
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:26,123
[All] Go!

210
00:15:48,523 --> 00:15:50,356
[Gojyo] Sanzo...

211
00:15:51,656 --> 00:15:53,623
It appears we have guests.

212
00:15:53,723 --> 00:15:57,456
They attack in the dead of
night, so our guard's down.

213
00:15:57,590 --> 00:16:00,023
The same ol' song and dance.

214
00:16:07,056 --> 00:16:09,256
Sounds like there's more
than one of them this time.

215
00:16:09,356 --> 00:16:13,123
[Gojyo] I was dreaming about
that girl. They are so dead.

216
00:16:17,523 --> 00:16:20,390
Three little...
meat dumplings...

217
00:16:21,956 --> 00:16:23,723
Hold it right
there, Sanzo party!

218
00:16:23,823 --> 00:16:24,990
Pay your ticket!

219
00:16:25,090 --> 00:16:26,923
Grow up, you lazy shoplifters!

220
00:16:27,023 --> 00:16:29,956
That one looked up my skirt!

221
00:16:30,056 --> 00:16:32,556
[The crowd complains further]

222
00:16:33,823 --> 00:16:36,123
What is this crap?

223
00:16:36,223 --> 00:16:39,490
I believe they must have
mistaken us for someone else.

224
00:16:39,590 --> 00:16:43,156
Come back, my sweet
little dumpling...

225
00:16:43,256 --> 00:16:45,690
[Sanzo] Wake up,
you stupid monkey!

226
00:16:49,097 --> 00:16:51,763
[The Fake Sanzo party
laughs triumphantly]

227
00:16:53,017 --> 00:16:55,277
[Fake Sanzo] It couldn't
have gone better!

228
00:16:55,277 --> 00:16:59,777
I bet they're getting their
asses beat in jail right now.

229
00:16:59,877 --> 00:17:04,044
[Fake Gojyo laughs] No matter
what mischief we get into,
they get to pay for it.

230
00:17:04,144 --> 00:17:05,444
How do you like that?!

231
00:17:05,544 --> 00:17:09,177
[Fake Sanzo] I feel like we're
getting to start all over again.

232
00:17:09,277 --> 00:17:11,377
You know, it's too bad we
can't go back and eat at

233
00:17:11,477 --> 00:17:14,344
that absolutely scrumptious
noodle house again.

234
00:17:14,444 --> 00:17:17,011
Their dumplings were superb,
best I ever tasted.

235
00:17:17,111 --> 00:17:20,211
[Goku] Damn it! I wanted
to eat those dumplings!

236
00:17:23,177 --> 00:17:24,944
[All] Oh my god! It's them!

237
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:26,377
But how did they...?!

238
00:17:26,477 --> 00:17:28,411
You four idiots
speak so loudly,

239
00:17:28,511 --> 00:17:30,411
we could hear you all
the way from town.

240
00:17:30,511 --> 00:17:34,344
We've told you. It's pretty
dangerous to be the Sanzo party.

241
00:17:34,444 --> 00:17:36,844
How dare you losers
try to frame us?

242
00:17:36,944 --> 00:17:39,111
You're really asking for it.

243
00:17:39,211 --> 00:17:41,177
[All] Oh please! Have mercy!

244
00:17:41,277 --> 00:17:43,077
You fakers!

245
00:17:43,177 --> 00:17:46,044
[Sounds of the Fake Sanzo
party being beaten to a pulp]

246
00:17:48,544 --> 00:17:51,611
[Gojyo] Beating up weaklings
leaves a bad taste in my mouth.

247
00:17:51,711 --> 00:17:53,044
I feel like a bully.

248
00:17:53,144 --> 00:17:56,244
[Goku] I could've enjoyed it
more if I weren't so hungry.

249
00:17:58,511 --> 00:18:00,077
Am I alive?

250
00:18:00,177 --> 00:18:03,111
I guess that the gods do exist.

251
00:18:03,211 --> 00:18:06,177
I thought that we were
all goners for sure.

252
00:18:06,277 --> 00:18:09,844
That's it for me. I'm
praying from now on.

253
00:18:09,944 --> 00:18:14,044
Yanno, you guys, it's not so
bad the second time. Ah ha.

254
00:18:14,144 --> 00:18:16,311
[Man] Don't think you
can get off that easy!

255
00:18:19,777 --> 00:18:22,111
I'm telling you for
the last time, pay up!

256
00:18:23,711 --> 00:18:27,544
[Storekeeper] You're paying
for everything you stole
from me, ya got that?!

257
00:18:27,644 --> 00:18:30,177
Do ya know what we do
to perverts like you?!

258
00:18:30,277 --> 00:18:33,077
[All] Oh please, have mercy!

259
00:18:33,177 --> 00:18:38,544
[Sounds of the Fake Sanzo party
getting beaten to a bigger pulp]

260
00:18:38,644 --> 00:18:41,044
[Man] That'll be the last
time they show their ugly
mugs around here.

261
00:18:41,144 --> 00:18:42,477
[Cook] We won't go
so easy on them.

262
00:18:42,577 --> 00:18:44,944
[The villager's chatting
begins to fade out]

263
00:18:47,277 --> 00:18:50,644
Are you... guys still alive?

264
00:18:50,744 --> 00:18:52,577
I'm not sure...

265
00:18:52,677 --> 00:18:56,144
I think I broke something
really important.

266
00:18:56,244 --> 00:19:01,577
Yes, but... don't you guys
feel like you were yourselves
again? I know I do.

267
00:19:01,677 --> 00:19:03,677
I'll have to agree
with ya there.

268
00:19:03,777 --> 00:19:09,277
I have to tell ya. I think in
the end, doing an honest day's
work just doesn't suit us.

269
00:19:09,377 --> 00:19:14,544
I guess life is more fun when
there's some element of risk
involved, don't you think?

270
00:19:14,644 --> 00:19:20,577
No matter how petty you
think your life is, you can
never lose your inner pride.

271
00:19:20,677 --> 00:19:28,311
I know I will always be just an
imposter, but I'm as proud as
the real Hakkai could ever be.

272
00:19:29,344 --> 00:19:31,044
What the hell was that for?!

273
00:19:31,144 --> 00:19:34,344
I was just starting to
feel better, ya jerk!

274
00:19:34,444 --> 00:19:37,477
[Kougaiji] Sorry, I didn't see
you lying there in the dark.

275
00:19:37,577 --> 00:19:40,511
Yeah right, that's
real funny, man.

276
00:19:40,611 --> 00:19:43,711
You should watch where
you're going, jackass.

277
00:19:43,811 --> 00:19:45,644
We're the legendary Sanzo party.

278
00:19:45,744 --> 00:19:49,177
Demons run fleeing, barefoot
at the mere sound of our name.

279
00:19:49,277 --> 00:19:50,511
Scared now?

280
00:19:50,611 --> 00:19:53,877
So... Sanzo party, huh?

281
00:19:53,977 --> 00:19:56,444
[All] Uh-have mercy!

282
00:19:56,544 --> 00:19:58,511
[Sounds of the Fake Sanzo party
being beaten to a final pulp]

283
00:20:00,377 --> 00:20:02,777
What a waste of my time.

284
00:20:02,877 --> 00:20:04,711
That's so weird!

285
00:20:04,811 --> 00:20:08,977
I could have sworn I smelled
the real Sanzo around here.

286
00:20:09,077 --> 00:20:10,111
[Kougaiji] Hurry yp.

287
00:20:10,211 --> 00:20:12,577
Their idiocy may be contagious.

288
00:20:14,177 --> 00:20:15,611
It...

289
00:20:15,711 --> 00:20:18,011
hurts so much...

290
00:20:18,111 --> 00:20:22,311
I almost don't care
about pride anymore.

291
00:20:22,411 --> 00:20:25,811
Given the choice between
life and pride, life.

292
00:20:25,911 --> 00:20:27,644
Life is more important.

293
00:20:27,777 --> 00:20:31,077
It's better to be alive.

294
00:20:31,777 --> 00:20:35,311
Hakkai, you okay?

295
00:20:35,411 --> 00:20:38,611
Ugh... If I make it
through this time...

296
00:20:39,844 --> 00:20:42,844
I say we don't dress
up like this...

297
00:20:42,944 --> 00:20:45,011
ever again.

298
00:20:45,111 --> 00:20:47,477
[All] Agreed.
