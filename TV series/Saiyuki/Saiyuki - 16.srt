1
00:01:45,587 --> 00:01:50,187
Well I'll be. I hate to tell
you this, but that guy's
still following us.

2
00:01:50,287 --> 00:01:53,508
Look, just keep walking.

3
00:01:53,608 --> 00:01:55,208
I'm just saying.

4
00:01:55,308 --> 00:01:57,208
[Sanzo] Will you just shut
up and walk?

5
00:01:57,575 --> 00:01:58,708
Okay...

6
00:02:04,308 --> 00:02:08,208
You realize I will always
be grateful to you for
saving my life.

7
00:02:10,875 --> 00:02:13,375
Perhaps this is my act
of penitence.

8
00:02:13,475 --> 00:02:17,308
The crimson color of your hair
and eyes reminds me of...

9
00:02:17,408 --> 00:02:19,742
...the color of all the blood
I have spilled.

10
00:02:22,875 --> 00:02:27,275
The crimson that stains my hands
is what keeps me grounded
in reality,

11
00:02:27,375 --> 00:02:30,842
even as I attempt to escape
the weight of my sins.

12
00:02:30,942 --> 00:02:35,175
Your hair and your eyes
are the only things that
admonish me, Gojyo.

13
00:02:36,908 --> 00:02:38,242
Remember that.

14
00:02:41,842 --> 00:02:44,608
<i>I'm such a... an asshole.</i>

15
00:02:45,308 --> 00:02:46,275
[Gojyo] Wake up, slowpoke!

16
00:02:46,375 --> 00:02:48,408
[Goku] Bastard! Come back here!

17
00:02:50,775 --> 00:02:51,908
Idiots.

18
00:02:56,875 --> 00:02:59,008
<i>Just you wait, Cho Gonou.</i>

19
00:02:59,108 --> 00:03:02,908
<i>This hair and these eyes may</i>
<i>just be able to save you one</i>
<i>more time.</i>

20
00:03:03,742 --> 00:03:05,475
<i>I won't let you down.</i>

21
00:03:11,275 --> 00:03:13,075
"An Ode to the Living"

22
00:03:21,642 --> 00:03:24,075
<i>My wound has opened again.</i>

23
00:03:24,908 --> 00:03:26,842
<i>I don't know why I'm surprised.</i>

24
00:03:32,208 --> 00:03:34,842
<i>I hope Gojyo is okay.</i>

25
00:03:34,942 --> 00:03:38,342
<i>I caused him trouble all the</i>
<i>way to the very end.</i>

26
00:03:40,675 --> 00:03:43,008
<i>I don't know why I brought</i>
<i>the gun with me.</i>

27
00:03:44,208 --> 00:03:46,908
<i>I suppose it's too late</i>
<i>to return it now.</i>

28
00:03:50,808 --> 00:03:52,208
<i>Kanan...</i>

29
00:03:53,475 --> 00:03:56,042
<i>Kanan, if I could...</i>

30
00:04:15,408 --> 00:04:18,442
<i>If I could only hold your body</i>
<i>in my arms...</i>

31
00:04:24,575 --> 00:04:25,708
What is... That's...

32
00:04:26,908 --> 00:04:30,375
[Crowman] That's my older
brother, and you killed him!

33
00:04:30,475 --> 00:04:33,108
I've been looking for you,
Cho Gonou!

34
00:04:33,208 --> 00:04:35,342
So that I could give you this!

35
00:04:38,042 --> 00:04:39,075
What is it?

36
00:04:39,175 --> 00:04:40,608
Nothing.

37
00:04:40,708 --> 00:04:42,575
<i>At least I hope it was.</i>

38
00:04:49,408 --> 00:04:52,775
[Goku] Sanzo, are you sure this
is the right direction?

39
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:57,142
I think I can make a fairly
educated guess as to where
Cho Gonou's headed.

40
00:04:57,242 --> 00:04:59,942
I'm betting Hyakugan
Maoh's place

41
00:05:00,042 --> 00:05:02,275
Hyakugan Maoh?

42
00:05:02,375 --> 00:05:05,475
It's where Cho Gonou
committed his mass murder.

43
00:05:06,642 --> 00:05:09,308
Hey...

44
00:05:09,408 --> 00:05:12,775
So what'll happen to him if
you catch him?

45
00:05:14,208 --> 00:05:16,675
You seem quite devoted to him.

46
00:05:16,775 --> 00:05:20,142
I did go through all that
trouble of saving his life,
you know.

47
00:05:20,275 --> 00:05:22,975
It would be such a waste
to have him die.

48
00:05:26,075 --> 00:05:29,075
[Sanzo] I don't know how Cho
Gonou will be dealt with either.

49
00:05:29,175 --> 00:05:32,075
The Sanbutsushin have sole
authority over that.

50
00:05:32,975 --> 00:05:34,442
[Gojyo] Hey...

51
00:05:34,542 --> 00:05:38,675
A high ranking monk like
yourself should know
what I am.

52
00:05:38,775 --> 00:05:41,408
From the color of my hair
and eyes alone.

53
00:05:42,275 --> 00:05:43,875
[Sanzo] You're a half-breed.

54
00:05:43,975 --> 00:05:47,542
Born of the unholy union between
man and demon.

55
00:05:47,642 --> 00:05:51,142
It is said their children have
crimson eyes and hair.

56
00:05:52,475 --> 00:05:54,475
Eyes the color of blood.

57
00:05:54,575 --> 00:05:57,442
He said he found penitence
in these eyes.

58
00:06:01,275 --> 00:06:03,042
I won't let you kill him.

59
00:06:03,142 --> 00:06:07,442
Even if this is just my vanity,
I won't let you kill him!

60
00:06:08,242 --> 00:06:09,508
This is so stupid.

61
00:06:09,608 --> 00:06:10,975
Excuse me?

62
00:06:11,075 --> 00:06:12,808
[Sanzo] What are you getting
out of this?

63
00:06:13,942 --> 00:06:15,842
I don't care how you
were concieved.

64
00:06:15,942 --> 00:06:20,875
Do you seriously believe that
the only red thing in the
entire world is blood?

65
00:06:20,975 --> 00:06:24,808
If you do, then you may as well
just shave your head right now.

66
00:06:24,908 --> 00:06:27,375
I know a temple you can join.

67
00:06:27,475 --> 00:06:29,042
I believe I'll pass.

68
00:06:30,642 --> 00:06:33,175
[Gojyo] Ow! You stupid monkey!
That hurts!

69
00:06:33,275 --> 00:06:35,808
Aw, your hair's cold after all.

70
00:06:35,908 --> 00:06:36,775
What?

71
00:06:36,875 --> 00:06:37,775
Your hair's so red,

72
00:06:37,875 --> 00:06:39,775
I thought you'd be burning up.

73
00:06:39,875 --> 00:06:42,608
But it's not hot at all.
You're just a fake.

74
00:06:45,175 --> 00:06:47,008
<i>What are you getting</i>
<i>out of this?</i>

75
00:06:48,375 --> 00:06:50,408
<i>I let my hair grow long,</i>

76
00:06:50,508 --> 00:06:53,808
<i>and now I'm trying to save</i>
<i>someone who needs me.</i>

77
00:06:53,908 --> 00:06:56,608
<i>But the one who wants to be</i>
<i>saved is me.</i>

78
00:06:58,575 --> 00:06:59,642
[Sanzo] What's wrong, Goku?

79
00:06:59,742 --> 00:07:01,175
[Goku] I smell blood.

80
00:07:02,708 --> 00:07:04,008
Which direction?

81
00:07:04,108 --> 00:07:06,475
[Goku] Let's see... This way!

82
00:07:06,575 --> 00:07:08,242
[Sanzo] Let's hurry!

83
00:07:08,342 --> 00:07:10,342
[Crowman] Do you remember
the dead faces

84
00:07:10,442 --> 00:07:12,875
of my clan, that you murdered?

85
00:07:12,975 --> 00:07:18,175
Do you remember the look in the
eyes of my family as you drove
in your blade?

86
00:07:18,275 --> 00:07:21,575
We of the Dark Crow had no
quarrel with you,

87
00:07:21,675 --> 00:07:25,508
it was Hyakugan Maoh who forced
us to abduct your lover.

88
00:07:25,608 --> 00:07:28,575
The sacrifice of one woman,
could have saved us!

89
00:07:28,675 --> 00:07:32,342
But you selfishly killed
them all for the sake of
your revenge!

90
00:07:32,442 --> 00:07:34,975
Now I seek revenge of my own!

91
00:07:49,375 --> 00:07:54,008
Let's see if you think
your woman was worth
all this bloodshed.

92
00:07:54,108 --> 00:07:57,742
Once you get a small taste
of what my clan has suffered!

93
00:07:57,842 --> 00:08:02,442
[Cho] So, you wish to have your
revenge that badly, eh?

94
00:08:02,542 --> 00:08:06,675
Well right then, fine, it's
not a life I would miss
that much anyway.

95
00:08:09,608 --> 00:08:13,708
I'll make a deal with you.
First I'll give you my
right eye.

96
00:08:13,808 --> 00:08:16,175
After that, you can have
my left.

97
00:08:16,275 --> 00:08:17,742
Then my ear.

98
00:08:17,842 --> 00:08:19,308
The my nose...

99
00:08:19,408 --> 00:08:20,708
Then my face...

100
00:08:20,808 --> 00:08:22,042
[Goku] Stop it!

101
00:08:25,375 --> 00:08:27,142
[Goku] Your eye! Is your eye...

102
00:08:29,408 --> 00:08:31,542
What on earth were
you thinking?!

103
00:08:32,708 --> 00:08:36,908
There's absolutely nothing
wrong with your eyes!

104
00:08:37,008 --> 00:08:40,342
I heard that you believe that
red was the color of penitence.

105
00:08:40,442 --> 00:08:43,075
Penitence to what? The gods?

106
00:08:45,042 --> 00:08:47,042
The gods do not save anyone.

107
00:08:47,142 --> 00:08:51,075
You alone are responcible for
saving your life.

108
00:08:51,175 --> 00:08:54,375
You could kill yourself if you
want to escape that way.

109
00:08:54,475 --> 00:08:57,508
Killing yourself will not
accomplish anything.

110
00:08:57,608 --> 00:09:00,975
But there are some things you
can do if you're still alive.

111
00:09:03,642 --> 00:09:06,308
[Crowman] Who the hell are you?!
His friends?!

112
00:09:06,975 --> 00:09:08,575
[Gojyo] No...

113
00:09:08,675 --> 00:09:12,242
If you want to kill him, well
then you go right ahead.

114
00:09:12,342 --> 00:09:17,008
But I should warn you that,
those who take it apon
themselves to kill others

115
00:09:17,108 --> 00:09:21,608
have to be prepared to have
others try to kill them
in return.

116
00:09:21,708 --> 00:09:25,375
That's what they call the law
of consequences. my friend.

117
00:09:25,475 --> 00:09:28,542
It was some cranky old monk that
once told me that.

118
00:09:28,642 --> 00:09:30,442
Don't mess with my head!

119
00:09:38,575 --> 00:09:41,542
These demons can be such
bird brains.

120
00:09:41,642 --> 00:09:43,175
Can you walk?

121
00:09:43,275 --> 00:09:44,442
[Cho] I can manage.

122
00:09:46,142 --> 00:09:47,442
[Sanzo] Hey!

123
00:09:47,542 --> 00:09:49,108
You are going, right?

124
00:09:51,642 --> 00:09:53,808
Hyakugan Maoh's castle.

125
00:09:54,808 --> 00:09:56,142
[Goku] Here!

126
00:09:56,242 --> 00:09:57,542
It's yours, isn't it?

127
00:09:59,275 --> 00:10:00,442
<i>Kanan...</i>

128
00:10:01,442 --> 00:10:02,442
[Sanzo] Let's go!

129
00:10:02,542 --> 00:10:03,708
Yes sir.

130
00:10:04,942 --> 00:10:06,175
I am in your debt.

131
00:10:19,336 --> 00:10:20,969
My god...

132
00:10:22,336 --> 00:10:24,898
This was Hyakugan Maoh's castle.

133
00:10:25,031 --> 00:10:28,698
It's been torched by someone,
just a couple days ago.

134
00:10:30,264 --> 00:10:31,864
I doubt anyone survived.

135
00:10:33,431 --> 00:10:34,798
[Cho] I see.

136
00:10:36,064 --> 00:10:38,864
Yet again, I wasn't able
to save her.

137
00:10:42,498 --> 00:10:47,098
Hey, chant the sutra for
her, you dumb monk.

138
00:10:47,198 --> 00:10:50,998
I doubt doing a chant would
ease his conscience any.

139
00:10:51,098 --> 00:10:54,298
That stuff's not really about
being logical, you know?

140
00:10:58,031 --> 00:11:00,631
I don't chant sutras for
the dead.

141
00:11:00,731 --> 00:11:01,864
You got that?

142
00:13:22,231 --> 00:13:27,764
[Gojyo] Sazno spoke in a
voice so clear it dispeled
any and all doubt.

143
00:13:38,498 --> 00:13:39,864
And it seemed for a moment...

144
00:13:41,598 --> 00:13:46,498
...we could all see again as we
gathered around this golden,
luminous light.

145
00:13:55,764 --> 00:13:56,898
What is this?

146
00:13:56,998 --> 00:13:58,864
[Monk] But...

147
00:13:58,964 --> 00:14:01,464
It's all right. Please put
them on me.

148
00:14:10,864 --> 00:14:12,864
[Sanbutsushin A] Priest Sanzo...

149
00:14:12,964 --> 00:14:15,598
Sinner Cho Gonou...

150
00:14:15,698 --> 00:14:17,864
You may now enter.

151
00:14:21,931 --> 00:14:24,931
<i>[Goku] Your hair's so red, I</i>
<i>thought you'd be burning up.</i>

152
00:14:26,464 --> 00:14:30,231
<i>[Gojyo] They all just say</i>
<i>whatever they feel like.</i>

153
00:14:30,331 --> 00:14:34,998
<i>[Sanzo] Do you seriously</i>
<i>believe that the only red thing</i>
<i>in the entire world is blood?</i>

154
00:14:35,098 --> 00:14:37,464
<i>[Gojyo] Of course not,</i>
<i>I know that.</i>

155
00:14:38,631 --> 00:14:40,464
<i>[Cho] They're an admonishment</i>
<i>to me.</i>

156
00:14:40,564 --> 00:14:42,631
<i>[Gojyo] Then, I'll just</i>
<i>cut it off.</i>

157
00:14:42,731 --> 00:14:45,764
<i>But the one who wants to be</i>
<i>saved is me.</i>

158
00:14:47,564 --> 00:14:50,231
<i>It was some old monk who</i>
<i>once told me that.</i>

159
00:14:52,364 --> 00:14:53,664
[Gojyo] What are you saying?!

160
00:14:53,764 --> 00:14:55,864
Cho Gonou is dead.

161
00:14:55,964 --> 00:14:58,131
What are you talking about?!

162
00:14:58,231 --> 00:15:01,998
Why'd you convince him not to
kill himself if you were going
to let him die?

163
00:15:03,598 --> 00:15:06,198
I said the gods save no one.

164
00:15:06,298 --> 00:15:09,764
No one is able to avoid the
fate they have chosen for
themselves.

165
00:15:09,864 --> 00:15:11,831
No one can. Not even you.

166
00:15:13,531 --> 00:15:18,198
[Gojyo] Man, that's the second
time a pretty face dumped me.

167
00:15:18,298 --> 00:15:20,698
You are truly vain.

168
00:15:20,798 --> 00:15:22,398
[Gojyo] Yeah, I guess I am.

169
00:15:29,348 --> 00:15:30,482
[Woman A] Gojyo?

170
00:15:32,315 --> 00:15:33,615
Yo!

171
00:15:33,715 --> 00:15:35,948
[Woman C] What's up with
the haircut?

172
00:15:36,048 --> 00:15:37,782
Oh, I needed a change.

173
00:15:37,882 --> 00:15:41,215
I haven't seen you around
the bar lately.

174
00:15:41,315 --> 00:15:43,248
I can't stay away.

175
00:15:43,348 --> 00:15:45,982
Gambling is the only way I know
how to make a living.

176
00:15:46,082 --> 00:15:48,015
[Woman A] Did you hook up
with someone?

177
00:15:48,115 --> 00:15:51,215
[Woman C] What's going on?
Are you settling down?

178
00:15:51,315 --> 00:15:53,815
Not this guy.

179
00:15:53,915 --> 00:15:57,848
Though I did spend some time
with a tall, dysfunctional
blonde,

180
00:15:57,948 --> 00:16:00,515
an impulsive excitable little
air head,

181
00:16:00,648 --> 00:16:02,948
and I had an emotionally
unstable, head case

182
00:16:03,048 --> 00:16:05,415
with a pretty face shack up with
me for awhle.

183
00:16:05,515 --> 00:16:08,282
[gasps] What are you telling me?

184
00:16:08,382 --> 00:16:09,515
[Gojyo] Later girls.

185
00:16:09,615 --> 00:16:13,448
[All three] Oh, don't go,
Gojyo! Hey!

186
00:16:13,548 --> 00:16:16,115
<i>[Gojyo] Nothing's changed.</i>

187
00:16:16,215 --> 00:16:18,582
<i>No matter how many times</i>
<i>I cut it,</i>

188
00:16:18,682 --> 00:16:21,082
<i>my hair's still red when it</i>
<i>grows back.</i>

189
00:16:21,182 --> 00:16:24,515
<i>And my eyes are always crimson</i>
<i>when I look in the mirror.</i>

190
00:16:24,615 --> 00:16:26,482
<i>But I'm starting to be</i>
<i>okay with that.</i>

191
00:16:27,415 --> 00:16:29,915
Hey buddy, I'll take me
one of these.

192
00:16:30,015 --> 00:16:31,882
[Clerk] You got it!

193
00:16:31,982 --> 00:16:35,348
[Hakkai] They're a beautiful
red, aren't they, Gojyo?

194
00:16:40,248 --> 00:16:43,048
[Gojyo] On second thought, I'll
take four of 'em.

195
00:16:46,182 --> 00:16:49,148
I'll be damned! It's been
a while!

196
00:16:49,248 --> 00:16:51,182
I'm afraid I was delayed.

197
00:16:51,282 --> 00:16:54,915
What the hell happened to your
head? You look like a pirate!

198
00:16:55,015 --> 00:16:57,848
You look like a chimp,
here have a few.

199
00:16:57,948 --> 00:16:59,682
[Goku] Oh, thank you!

200
00:16:59,782 --> 00:17:02,048
Hey, apples! Fantastic!

201
00:17:03,415 --> 00:17:08,448
Dumb monk, what's the big idea?
You said he died.

202
00:17:08,548 --> 00:17:09,748
[Sanzo] What're you
talking about?

203
00:17:09,848 --> 00:17:13,015
What do you mean "What am I
talking about?"

204
00:17:13,115 --> 00:17:15,382
Buddhism forbids taking a life.

205
00:17:15,482 --> 00:17:19,682
He may be a criminal but you
didn't think we'd actually
kill him did you?

206
00:17:19,782 --> 00:17:21,115
Just use your head.

207
00:17:22,048 --> 00:17:24,682
<i>I should kill you.</i>

208
00:17:26,115 --> 00:17:28,482
So, they did set you free, huh?

209
00:17:28,582 --> 00:17:33,015
Uh-huh, though it wouldn't have
happened without Mr. Sanzo's
full support.

210
00:17:33,115 --> 00:17:35,948
He was nice enough to interceded
with the Sanbutsushin,

211
00:17:36,048 --> 00:17:40,015
to allow me to discard the
name of Cho Gonou and start
a new life.

212
00:17:40,115 --> 00:17:42,215
Well then, what should I call
you from now on?

213
00:17:43,082 --> 00:17:46,382
Hakkai, it's Cho Hakkai.

214
00:17:46,482 --> 00:17:51,382
Cho Hakkai... Yeah, that fits
you much better than the old
one did!

215
00:17:51,482 --> 00:17:53,715
You think so?

216
00:17:53,815 --> 00:17:56,448
You sure that's not too much
for your puny monkey brain
to remember?

217
00:17:56,548 --> 00:18:00,082
I can too remember!
It's Hakkai! Hakkai!

218
00:18:00,182 --> 00:18:03,182
Hakkai! Hakkai! Hakkai! Hakkai!
Hakkai! Hakkai!

219
00:18:03,282 --> 00:18:05,248
You know I think Goku's
on to something.

220
00:18:05,348 --> 00:18:08,915
Say it a few more times and he
might actually have it down.

221
00:18:09,015 --> 00:18:09,982
How many?

222
00:18:10,082 --> 00:18:11,748
Thousand.

223
00:18:11,848 --> 00:18:13,848
So, what do you have planned for
your new life?

224
00:18:13,948 --> 00:18:18,048
Gojyo and I get alone all right,
so I thought I might room with
him for a little while.

225
00:18:18,148 --> 00:18:21,915
Besides the poor guy can't even
remember what day they come to
pick up the trash.

226
00:18:22,015 --> 00:18:24,615
He'd be absolutely hopeless
without me.

227
00:18:24,715 --> 00:18:26,382
[Sanzo] Try living with a chimp.
[Gojyo] You shut up!

228
00:18:26,482 --> 00:18:28,015
[Hakkai] It's funny.
[Goku] Don't tell me what to do,

229
00:18:28,115 --> 00:18:29,315
[Goku] you purple head
shit head!
[Hakkai] I've sought death for
so long.

230
00:18:29,415 --> 00:18:30,548
[Gojyo] Okay, that's it!

231
00:18:30,648 --> 00:18:32,815
[Gojyo] Now you're gonna get it!
[Hakkai] But now...

232
00:18:32,915 --> 00:18:36,148
There's nothing more valuable
in this world to me than life.

233
00:18:36,248 --> 00:18:39,182
Hakkai, I just got your new
name memorized,

234
00:18:39,282 --> 00:18:41,182
so you better not change it!

235
00:18:42,248 --> 00:18:43,382
All right.

236
00:18:45,448 --> 00:18:49,648
So? Is this haircut suppose to
be a way of putting your past
behind you?

237
00:18:49,748 --> 00:18:53,082
Not really, I'm probably just
the same as him.

238
00:18:53,182 --> 00:18:55,115
Engaged in a futile struggle.

239
00:18:55,215 --> 00:18:58,848
Life is basically a futile
struggle until you die anyway.

240
00:18:59,815 --> 00:19:01,515
Problem?

241
00:19:01,615 --> 00:19:03,782
Does the look suit me?

242
00:19:03,882 --> 00:19:06,815
Anything's better than that
nasty long hair.

243
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:10,582
[Gojyo] Then it's settled,
I'll grow it out again.

244
00:19:10,682 --> 00:19:11,948
Shouldn't take too long.

245
00:19:13,182 --> 00:19:15,048
[Sanzo] Are you trying to
pick a fight?!

246
00:19:15,882 --> 00:19:16,915
All right!

247
00:19:17,015 --> 00:19:18,082
What?!

248
00:19:18,182 --> 00:19:19,448
What do you say we all go eat?

249
00:19:19,548 --> 00:19:22,715
[Goku] Ahaha! You said it!
Food! Food!

250
00:19:22,815 --> 00:19:24,082
[Sanzo] You're so noisy.
Will you shut up?

251
00:19:24,882 --> 00:19:26,515
Can we go, Sanzo?

252
00:19:26,615 --> 00:19:28,882
Are you kidding? There's no
way that-

253
00:19:32,148 --> 00:19:33,715
You better be treating.

254
00:19:37,715 --> 00:19:40,182
[Hakkai] Oh, what
wonderful weather!

255
00:19:40,282 --> 00:19:41,615
[Gojyo] Perfect day for
a field trip, eh?

256
00:19:41,715 --> 00:19:44,015
[Hakkai] There you go, let's
make it a picnic.

257
00:19:44,115 --> 00:19:46,615
[Goku] Sanzo, are the bananas
for snack time?

258
00:19:46,715 --> 00:19:50,848
[Sanzo] Will you cut it out? I
wouldn't go on a trip with you
fools if you paid me.

259
00:19:56,782 --> 00:19:59,315
<i>[Gojyo] That's what Sanzo said</i>
<i>three years ago,</i>

260
00:19:59,415 --> 00:20:01,248
<i>and we're still driving.</i>

261
00:20:01,348 --> 00:20:06,182
You're probably able to rest
easier now that the rain has
let up, eh Sanzo?

262
00:20:06,282 --> 00:20:11,048
What makes you think I would?
You're the one who gets uneasy
every time it's raining.

263
00:20:12,482 --> 00:20:13,515
Yes that's true.

264
00:20:13,615 --> 00:20:15,482
So tell me, why do you guys
hate rain so much?

265
00:20:15,582 --> 00:20:17,115
Is there something you two
aren't telling me?

266
00:20:17,215 --> 00:20:20,115
Come on! I want to know. What is
it? What is it? Huh?

267
00:20:20,215 --> 00:20:21,982
[Goku] Ow! What was that for?!
[Sanzo] Shut up!

268
00:20:22,082 --> 00:20:25,182
[Gojyo] Sit down and shut up.
You're not old enough to
understand yet.

269
00:20:25,282 --> 00:20:26,982
[Goku] What are you
talking about?

270
00:20:27,082 --> 00:20:28,748
[Gojyo] See? I told you.

271
00:20:31,915 --> 00:20:35,482
<i>[Gojyo] I guess the best way</i>
<i>to put it is we're stuck with</i>
<i>each other.</i>

272
00:20:35,582 --> 00:20:40,315
<i>Our origins, our missions,</i>
<i>our past. None of that</i>
<i>really matters.</i>

273
00:20:40,415 --> 00:20:44,015
<i>We're just living, so that one</i>
<i>day we can die laughing.</i>

274
00:20:44,115 --> 00:20:49,248
And it's not looking as if this
little fieldtrip of ours is
going to be ending anytime soon.

275
00:22:28,448 --> 00:22:30,715
[Goku] When we meet a mysterious
lady in the desert,

276
00:22:30,815 --> 00:22:33,248
she leads us to the village
of Tofugai.

277
00:22:33,348 --> 00:22:36,648
But when we arrive we find out
that it's an abandoned
ghost town!

278
00:22:36,748 --> 00:22:40,815
Not to mention the weird demon
shaped statues sitting around
everywhere.

279
00:22:40,915 --> 00:22:43,982
Hey wait a second! Why are my
feet turning to stone!

280
00:22:44,082 --> 00:22:48,115
What's going on here?! Does
that woman have something
to do with this?

281
00:22:48,215 --> 00:22:51,815
Find out next time on Saiyuki
in "Eternal Paradise".
