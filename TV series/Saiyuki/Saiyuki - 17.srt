1
00:01:34,941 --> 00:01:38,741
[Goku] I'm hot!
[Gojyo] Shut up, you
stupid monkey!

2
00:01:38,741 --> 00:01:40,441
Your hot air ain't making
it any cooler around here!

3
00:01:40,541 --> 00:01:44,275
[Goku] Your overgrown hair
is far more obnoxious,
you carrot head!

4
00:01:44,375 --> 00:01:45,841
Why don't you cut
that stuff off?

5
00:01:45,941 --> 00:01:47,108
[Gojyu] You say that to my face.

6
00:01:47,208 --> 00:01:49,975
[Sanzo] Hakkai, how much further
before the next town?

7
00:01:50,075 --> 00:01:53,308
[Hakkai] According to the map,
we should come up on the village
of Tofugai any minute now.

8
00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:56,208
[Goku] Hakkai, if we don't get
the pervy water sprite into
town, he's going to dry up.

9
00:01:59,708 --> 00:02:02,775
[Hakkai] I'm afraid
we're out of water.

10
00:02:02,875 --> 00:02:06,675
[Goyjo] Yeah, yeah. We had
this conversation yesterday.

11
00:02:06,775 --> 00:02:07,908
[Hakkai gasp]

12
00:02:17,241 --> 00:02:19,575
What, did a cat jump in front of
the jeep or something?!

13
00:02:19,675 --> 00:02:22,841
Maybe you should get that other
eye checked out as well, huh?!

14
00:02:22,941 --> 00:02:24,075
[Gojyo & Goku] Huh?

15
00:02:30,908 --> 00:02:32,941
[Gojyo] A woman. And she's...

16
00:02:33,041 --> 00:02:35,141
[Hakkai] She's a demon.

17
00:02:35,241 --> 00:02:37,341
Please, I beg you...

18
00:02:37,441 --> 00:02:40,441
You must take me to
the desert town of...

19
00:02:40,541 --> 00:02:42,675
Tofugai.

20
00:02:51,541 --> 00:02:53,741
[Goku] "Eternal Paradise"

21
00:02:57,808 --> 00:03:02,008
[Gojyo] Here we are saving some
demon we hardly even know.

22
00:03:02,108 --> 00:03:05,208
Sometimes I just don't
get what goes on in that
thick monk head of his.

23
00:03:05,308 --> 00:03:09,275
Why not? We were all headed on
our way into Tofugai anyway.

24
00:03:09,375 --> 00:03:10,841
[Gojyo] That's not the point!

25
00:03:10,941 --> 00:03:14,041
Are you absolutely sure
about this, Sanzo?

26
00:03:14,141 --> 00:03:18,575
I do not sense any evil or
hostility from that woman.

27
00:03:18,675 --> 00:03:23,108
We'll just have to take her
with us to Tofugai and then
see what happens to her there.

28
00:03:23,208 --> 00:03:26,675
Yeah... What could be
the harm in that?

29
00:03:30,141 --> 00:03:32,775
[Goku] Wow, what is this place?!

30
00:03:32,875 --> 00:03:37,341
My town of Tofugai will
be found at the very
bottom of this gorge.

31
00:03:39,275 --> 00:03:40,008
You were... awake all along?

32
00:03:40,141 --> 00:03:42,075
In return for saving my life,

33
00:03:42,175 --> 00:03:44,708
I am offering my services
as your guide.

34
00:03:45,975 --> 00:03:46,975
Let's go.

35
00:03:47,075 --> 00:03:48,541
[All] Huh?!

36
00:03:48,641 --> 00:03:51,408
Pardon me, but Sanzo...

37
00:03:51,508 --> 00:03:54,775
Hakuryu is unable to fly
in his current form.

38
00:03:54,875 --> 00:03:56,841
And it's a long way
down this gorge.

39
00:03:56,941 --> 00:03:58,508
[Sanzo] Who asked him to fly?

40
00:03:58,608 --> 00:04:00,775
I just want him to go down.

41
00:04:00,875 --> 00:04:03,875
Okay, I guess I have
no choice then.

42
00:04:03,975 --> 00:04:07,041
Hakkai, don't you dare even
think about doing it!

43
00:04:07,141 --> 00:04:08,908
Everyone hold on!

44
00:04:10,775 --> 00:04:12,475
Don't fail me, Hakuryu!

45
00:04:20,108 --> 00:04:24,275
Oh my god! It's completely
dark down there! I can't
see a single thing!

46
00:04:27,141 --> 00:04:28,808
<i>This mist...</i>

47
00:04:30,775 --> 00:04:32,341
Hakkai, you bastard!

48
00:04:32,441 --> 00:04:34,741
Don't you ever pull
a stunt like that again!

49
00:04:34,841 --> 00:04:37,475
This mist... is as
thick as pudding.

50
00:04:37,575 --> 00:04:39,441
Wha's up with this place?

51
00:04:39,541 --> 00:04:41,341
I don't know.

52
00:04:42,675 --> 00:04:45,208
Woman, where did you lead us?

53
00:04:47,108 --> 00:04:48,808
[Goku] What?
[Gojyo] Earthquake?

54
00:04:48,908 --> 00:04:52,375
[Kouran] This town is on the
verge of being swallowed up.

55
00:04:52,475 --> 00:04:54,508
[Sanzo] Swallowed up? By what?

56
00:04:54,608 --> 00:04:55,908
[Kouran] I do not know.

57
00:04:56,008 --> 00:04:57,808
I am only your guide.

58
00:04:57,908 --> 00:05:01,041
Please wait here while
I open the gates for you.

59
00:05:11,875 --> 00:05:16,541
[Kouran] Once I have
opened the gates, please
go to the tower.

60
00:05:16,641 --> 00:05:18,208
I will wait for you there.

61
00:05:20,641 --> 00:05:22,408
Don't be late.

62
00:05:24,475 --> 00:05:26,908
Who's bright idea... was this?

63
00:05:27,008 --> 00:05:30,741
We can't go back now. Whatever's
going to happen, will happen.

64
00:05:30,841 --> 00:05:36,008
And all this time I thought he
was saving her out of some sense
of mercy and compassion,

65
00:05:36,108 --> 00:05:39,075
but now it turns out that he-

66
00:05:39,175 --> 00:05:43,475
Hey! Those things are
for smacking people with,
not for throwing!

67
00:05:50,175 --> 00:05:52,575
Where's that light coming from?

68
00:05:52,675 --> 00:05:57,275
I can't say, but I sense
no danger or evil from it.

69
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:59,841
[Hakkai] In that case,
shall we go?

70
00:06:03,441 --> 00:06:06,175
[Ni] Lady Koushu, how are you?

71
00:06:06,275 --> 00:06:09,341
I trust you're in
excellent health?

72
00:06:09,441 --> 00:06:13,641
[Koushu] Nevermind the
formalities just tell me
why you're here. I'm busy.

73
00:06:13,741 --> 00:06:19,475
[Ni] A thousand pardons,
my lady. I shall deliver
my report right away then.

74
00:06:23,108 --> 00:06:24,308
Did you tell her?

75
00:06:24,408 --> 00:06:28,641
I'm afraid Lady Koushu is
extremely busy at the moment.

76
00:06:30,575 --> 00:06:35,041
She does not wish to be bothered
about some insignificant
town in the desert.

77
00:06:35,141 --> 00:06:38,508
[Huang] "Insignificant"?!
Tofugai is running with demons

78
00:06:38,608 --> 00:06:41,208
that have managed to maintain
their sense of self.

79
00:06:41,308 --> 00:06:43,641
[Huang] That added to the fact-
[Ni] Temper, temper.

80
00:06:43,741 --> 00:06:48,308
Getting angry will only
irritate your skin, on top
of which, you'll have pimples.

81
00:06:48,841 --> 00:06:50,208
Don't you mock me!

82
00:06:50,308 --> 00:06:54,841
Need I remind you that
a particular party will
pass by that town?

83
00:06:54,941 --> 00:06:58,708
[Ni] It appears that our
dear Lady Koushu simply cannot

84
00:06:58,808 --> 00:07:03,175
be interested in such a
localized little village.

85
00:07:03,275 --> 00:07:08,708
You wouldn't be suggesting that
you disapprove of the Lady's
inclinations, would you?

86
00:07:12,141 --> 00:07:15,975
[Ni] Doctor Huang,
you aren't considering
offering counsel yourself?

87
00:07:17,108 --> 00:07:18,808
[Huang] I'm going
to the bathroom!

88
00:07:18,908 --> 00:07:22,141
[Ni] Ah, down the hallway
to your left, on the
right-hand side.

89
00:07:22,241 --> 00:07:23,475
I know that!

90
00:07:31,541 --> 00:07:33,641
[Goku] I don't see
a soul anywhere.

91
00:07:33,741 --> 00:07:35,675
It's like a... a ghost town.

92
00:07:35,775 --> 00:07:36,908
Huh?

93
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:41,075
[Goku] Sanzo, look!

94
00:07:44,875 --> 00:07:48,108
Is everyone who lives in this
town a sculptor or what?

95
00:07:48,208 --> 00:07:49,841
What awful taste!

96
00:07:49,941 --> 00:07:53,808
I suggest we turn back now.

97
00:07:55,008 --> 00:07:57,641
[Sanzo] It seems we have no
choice but to go by foot.

98
00:08:02,175 --> 00:08:06,541
Gentlemen. These are no ordinary
statues we have here.

99
00:08:06,641 --> 00:08:10,375
Oh? What exactly
are you sensing?

100
00:08:10,475 --> 00:08:14,641
These statues must be
what became of the
town's inhabitants.

101
00:08:14,741 --> 00:08:18,408
It's possible they turned
themselves into stone
for some reason.

102
00:08:18,508 --> 00:08:23,741
Or maybe they were petrified
by someone else. But there is
something living inside them.

103
00:08:31,141 --> 00:08:32,275
Sanzo...

104
00:08:32,375 --> 00:08:34,675
Okay. That was weird.

105
00:08:36,775 --> 00:08:38,541
[Sanzo] Let's head
for the tower.

106
00:08:38,641 --> 00:08:40,841
That woman knows what's
going on here.

107
00:08:43,641 --> 00:08:45,608
[Goyjo] Where the hell
are you, lady?

108
00:08:45,708 --> 00:08:47,608
We came here, just like
you told us to

109
00:08:49,575 --> 00:08:51,941
[Sanzo] Come out here!
Show yourself!

110
00:08:52,041 --> 00:08:57,041
[Kouran] Sanz. I must insist
that you not kill anymore
of our townspeople.

111
00:08:57,141 --> 00:08:58,541
Come again?

112
00:08:58,641 --> 00:09:02,241
[Kouran] They are weak
and unable to withstand
your energies.

113
00:09:02,341 --> 00:09:03,675
You must not touch.

114
00:09:03,775 --> 00:09:05,875
I want to know the
meaning of all this?

115
00:09:05,975 --> 00:09:08,675
What is your purpose
for bringing here?

116
00:09:09,308 --> 00:09:11,608
[Kouran] To test you.

117
00:09:11,708 --> 00:09:13,241
A test?

118
00:09:13,341 --> 00:09:17,908
[Kouran] I shall reveal
all to the chosen ones
who can complete the trial.

119
00:09:18,008 --> 00:09:20,841
Aw shucks. Flattery'll
get you nowhere.

120
00:09:20,941 --> 00:09:23,208
[High pitched sound begins]

121
00:09:24,541 --> 00:09:25,441
My ears!

122
00:09:26,241 --> 00:09:27,008
What's wrong?!

123
00:09:27,108 --> 00:09:28,241
[Goku] I don't know!

124
00:09:31,241 --> 00:09:33,408
I'm turning into a statue!

125
00:09:33,508 --> 00:09:35,408
This isn't funny!

126
00:09:35,508 --> 00:09:37,441
Sanzo, it's a trap!
Get out of here!

127
00:09:37,875 --> 00:09:38,941
I'm coming!

128
00:09:41,708 --> 00:09:45,041
<i>Wait. If I touch them, they</i>
<i>might disintegrate also.</i>

129
00:09:47,075 --> 00:09:51,175
<i>She lured us here so that</i>
<i>she could snare us like</i>
<i>the rest of them.</i>

130
00:09:53,641 --> 00:09:55,808
You've got some nerve.

131
00:09:58,541 --> 00:10:00,075
So, you finally show yourself?

132
00:10:00,175 --> 00:10:03,108
[Kouran] Now I know the true
nature of your friends.

133
00:10:03,208 --> 00:10:07,408
It looks like you're the
only one who was immune
to the petrification.

134
00:10:07,508 --> 00:10:12,141
This is no concern of
yours. Now turn them back.

135
00:10:12,241 --> 00:10:13,541
I have no time for
your stupid games!

136
00:10:14,575 --> 00:10:17,575
The name I go by is Kouran.

137
00:10:17,675 --> 00:10:21,841
This is all in accordance
with Master Wuhan's wishes.

138
00:10:28,421 --> 00:10:32,222
[Kouran] It is said, "one day
four holy men will arrive.

139
00:10:32,222 --> 00:10:36,055
If they be demon, they will
turn to stone in the city.

140
00:10:36,155 --> 00:10:39,389
If they be human, they
will surely help us."

141
00:10:39,489 --> 00:10:41,755
This is Master Wuhan's prophecy.

142
00:10:41,855 --> 00:10:43,422
Wu-Wuhan?

143
00:10:48,055 --> 00:10:53,489
Accordig to Master Wuhan's
will, I was to bring these
four holy men here.

144
00:10:53,589 --> 00:10:57,555
Perhaps I was mistaken. You
are not the four I seek.

145
00:10:57,689 --> 00:10:59,989
[Kouran] Such villainous...
[Sanzo] You dumb slut.

146
00:11:01,355 --> 00:11:02,922
You're not getting away!

147
00:11:07,622 --> 00:11:09,989
What is that woman up to?

148
00:11:26,255 --> 00:11:27,922
Who are these people?

149
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:06,389
What a minute. What's
going on here?

150
00:12:09,989 --> 00:12:12,755
They can see the energy
within you too.

151
00:12:12,855 --> 00:12:16,755
[Sanzo] Explain.
[Kouran] The energy of the
chosen is so strong that

152
00:12:16,855 --> 00:12:20,822
it would even be able to destroy
the demons living here.

153
00:12:20,922 --> 00:12:25,189
[Sanzo] The chosen one? Energy?
What are you talking about?

154
00:12:25,289 --> 00:12:28,455
[Kouran] You are chosen,
selected by Master Wuhan.

155
00:12:28,555 --> 00:12:30,722
[Sanzo] Who is this Master
Wuhan?

156
00:12:30,822 --> 00:12:33,389
[Kouran] Master Wuhan was
everything to us.

157
00:12:33,489 --> 00:12:40,355
His prophecies brought us wealth
and allowed us to live in peace
until that fateful day.

158
00:12:40,455 --> 00:12:45,122
The day the mist descended
on the gorge. Our fellow
townspeople working

159
00:12:45,222 --> 00:12:51,155
the fields were suddenly
overcome by a murderous
rage and attacked us.

160
00:12:51,255 --> 00:12:55,389
[Sanzo] The aura that rules
demons blanketing all of
Shangri-la...

161
00:12:55,489 --> 00:13:00,222
Someone is attempting to
use the mist to try to
resurrect the Gyumaoh.

162
00:13:00,322 --> 00:13:04,155
[Kouran] You are fighting
the people responsible
for this madness?

163
00:13:04,255 --> 00:13:06,955
I'm just... on a
fieldtrip westward.

164
00:13:07,055 --> 00:13:12,455
Is that the case? Won't
you please come and speak
with my Master Wuhan,

165
00:13:12,555 --> 00:13:14,989
so that you may help us
save this town.

166
00:13:15,089 --> 00:13:18,522
So I finally get to meet
the man himself, huh?

167
00:13:33,689 --> 00:13:35,955
[Sanzo] There's one thing I
still don't understand.

168
00:13:36,055 --> 00:13:37,755
And what might that be?

169
00:13:37,855 --> 00:13:39,355
You're a demon just like
the others,

170
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:43,422
so how is it you were able
to keep your sanity when
the others weren't?

171
00:13:43,522 --> 00:13:46,889
I wear special vestments
that can protect me from
the aura,

172
00:13:46,989 --> 00:13:49,022
made by Master Wuhan himself.

173
00:13:49,122 --> 00:13:53,222
It was only Master Wuhan's
holy powers, that allowed

174
00:13:53,322 --> 00:13:57,022
this town of Tofugai to
remain a Paradise on Earth.

175
00:14:03,055 --> 00:14:08,222
He bestowed these vestments
upon me and evacuated the
children and elderly.

176
00:14:08,322 --> 00:14:13,089
[Sanzo] Wrong. The aura that
controls demons was probably
just slow to reach this place.

177
00:14:13,189 --> 00:14:16,322
Wuhan had nothing to do with it.

178
00:14:16,422 --> 00:14:21,289
[Kouran] Master Wuhan forsaw
that a savior would one day
arrive in this land.

179
00:14:21,389 --> 00:14:25,855
Those who've been turned
into stone have been waiting
a long time for that day.

180
00:14:26,889 --> 00:14:28,155
[Sanzo] How arbitrary.

181
00:14:28,255 --> 00:14:31,522
He used magic to turn those
inconvenient to him into stone,

182
00:14:31,622 --> 00:14:34,589
and rule over the helpless
with threats.

183
00:14:34,689 --> 00:14:37,689
How dare you say that?!
Master Wuhan is absolute!

184
00:14:37,789 --> 00:14:39,289
Even now, he's devoting
his ti-

185
00:14:39,389 --> 00:14:41,355
Take a look and see what's
in their hearts!

186
00:14:41,455 --> 00:14:44,889
Robbed of their freedom,
they'll go insane, and
suffer for eternity!

187
00:14:44,989 --> 00:14:46,589
That is...

188
00:14:46,689 --> 00:14:50,289
That is certainly not the
outcome that Master Wuhan
had intended for us.

189
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:53,689
The only thing he wishes is to
provide for peace in this town.

190
00:14:53,789 --> 00:14:57,155
A peace he only keeps
by force. Pshaw.

191
00:15:07,122 --> 00:15:10,822
[Kouran] Master Wuhan, I have
brought the man called Sanzo.

192
00:15:11,822 --> 00:15:14,755
Please Master, I want
you to wake up.

193
00:15:17,722 --> 00:15:23,622
<i>A mummified monk? He died</i>
<i>while meditating, preserving</i>
<i>him instantly.</i>

194
00:15:24,522 --> 00:15:26,289
<i>What in the world...</i>

195
00:15:29,189 --> 00:15:32,489
[Wuhan] Sanzo, it is
good of you to come.

196
00:15:32,589 --> 00:15:34,889
You may call me Wuhan.

197
00:15:34,989 --> 00:15:36,922
I protect the town of Tofugai,

198
00:15:37,022 --> 00:15:41,322
and and make sure the people
go down the right path.

199
00:15:41,422 --> 00:15:45,655
[Sanzo] Heh, funny. You
just look like some ole
dead geezer to me.

200
00:15:45,755 --> 00:15:49,655
What's would some old fossil
want with a monk like me?

201
00:15:53,789 --> 00:15:55,489
[Wuhan] There's no time.

202
00:15:55,589 --> 00:15:58,422
Soon, the effects of my spell
will wear off,

203
00:15:58,522 --> 00:16:00,622
and the town will collapse.

204
00:16:00,722 --> 00:16:02,955
Then the demons will...

205
00:16:03,055 --> 00:16:04,022
Hmph.

206
00:16:04,122 --> 00:16:06,555
[Wuhan] Won't you protect
my town? Surely

207
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:10,555
it means something that you
appeared in my final moments.

208
00:16:10,655 --> 00:16:12,755
That can't be a coincidence.

209
00:16:12,855 --> 00:16:15,289
You say this is your town?
It's your town?

210
00:16:15,389 --> 00:16:17,755
Just who in the hell do you
think you're talking to, sir?

211
00:16:17,855 --> 00:16:20,289
I bet you feel like a saint
taking pity on these poor,

212
00:16:20,389 --> 00:16:23,189
helpless townspeople even
after you're dead.

213
00:16:23,289 --> 00:16:26,089
[Wuhan] You refuse to fight
because you believe

214
00:16:26,189 --> 00:16:30,122
the one ruling the demons
is an unforgiving tyrant?

215
00:16:30,222 --> 00:16:32,889
You're the one ruling the
people of this town!

216
00:16:36,155 --> 00:16:37,989
[Wuhan] You are our only hope.

217
00:16:46,155 --> 00:16:49,222
What you're doing is just
for your own satisfaction!

218
00:16:49,322 --> 00:16:51,522
Don't blame others!

219
00:16:51,622 --> 00:16:54,822
Wake up! This place
is falling apart!

220
00:16:54,922 --> 00:16:57,855
Master... Wuhan...

221
00:17:00,355 --> 00:17:03,755
[Huang] Doctor Ni. Tofugai
is being... swallowed up.

222
00:17:03,855 --> 00:17:05,522
I told you, didn't I?

223
00:17:05,622 --> 00:17:07,322
All we had to do was wait.

224
00:17:07,422 --> 00:17:12,922
I won't go! I must stay here and
protect Master Wuhan from bein-!

225
00:17:13,022 --> 00:17:16,155
Now wake up. Will you forget
about that old mummy's

226
00:17:16,255 --> 00:17:19,155
elaborate speeches and take
a look around you?

227
00:17:23,989 --> 00:17:26,289
It's collapsing! We have
to get out!

228
00:17:26,389 --> 00:17:29,555
No we can't! If we leave then
they'll all turn into stone!

229
00:17:29,655 --> 00:17:35,989
Into stone?! Try again!
What's waiting them is far
more terrifying of a fate!

230
00:17:36,089 --> 00:17:37,622
It's much, much worse!

231
00:17:43,589 --> 00:17:44,922
This is...

232
00:17:46,489 --> 00:17:49,422
[Sanzo] This is what's happening
to Shangri-la right now.

233
00:17:50,255 --> 00:17:52,089
Everyone, listen to me!

234
00:17:52,189 --> 00:17:53,755
Have you forgotten
Wuhan's will?!

235
00:17:53,855 --> 00:17:55,655
[fighting beginning]

236
00:17:58,322 --> 00:18:01,789
Now stop this! We are
fellow townspeople!

237
00:18:08,589 --> 00:18:12,155
Are you still not see what's
happening to these people?

238
00:18:12,289 --> 00:18:16,289
They are only capable of seeing
us as beings to be destoryed.

239
00:18:35,189 --> 00:18:36,722
Kouran...

240
00:18:36,822 --> 00:18:39,889
Sanzo, we will continue living.

241
00:18:39,989 --> 00:18:44,622
But we can not continue living
in the world as it is now.

242
00:18:44,755 --> 00:18:49,255
We will wait for the day when
peace will return to us.

243
00:18:49,355 --> 00:18:50,922
Do what you want.

244
00:18:51,022 --> 00:18:54,222
But you better return here
as my companions.

245
00:18:54,322 --> 00:18:56,722
[Kouran] Those who choose
to live, gather round.

246
00:18:56,822 --> 00:18:59,689
We don't know when, but one
day we will be resurrected!

247
00:18:59,789 --> 00:19:06,989
[Townspeople mumbling] I want
to live! I don't want to die!

248
00:19:10,922 --> 00:19:14,489
O Tofugai, I seal thee!

249
00:19:26,189 --> 00:19:30,389
[Kouran] Sanzo, thank you
for showing me the truth.

250
00:19:42,944 --> 00:19:46,911
<i>Peace... within a</i>
<i>tiny glass globe.</i>

251
00:19:51,077 --> 00:19:53,777
[Goku] I'm hot!
[Gojyo] Shut up, you
stupid monkey!

252
00:19:53,877 --> 00:19:56,244
Your hot air ain't making
it any cooler around here!

253
00:19:56,377 --> 00:19:59,544
[Goku] Your overgrown hair
is far more obnoxious,
you carrot head!

254
00:19:59,644 --> 00:20:01,177
Why don't you cut
that stuff off?

255
00:20:01,277 --> 00:20:02,911
[Gojyo] You say that to my face!

256
00:20:03,011 --> 00:20:05,377
[Goku] Hakkai, how much further
before this town?

257
00:20:05,477 --> 00:20:09,644
[Hakkai] According to the map,
we should come up on the village
of Tofugai any minute now.

258
00:20:09,744 --> 00:20:12,011
Hakkai, if we don't get
this pervy water sprite

259
00:20:12,111 --> 00:20:14,811
to town soon,he's going
to dry up and blow away.

260
00:20:16,244 --> 00:20:17,844
I'm afraid we're out of water.

261
00:20:17,944 --> 00:20:21,311
Yeah, yeah, we had this
conversation yesterday,
didn't we?

262
00:20:21,911 --> 00:20:24,144
[All three] Huh?

263
00:20:24,244 --> 00:20:27,811
Hold on, didn't we have
this conversation the day
before yesterday too?

264
00:20:27,911 --> 00:20:29,511
Hey, Sanzo?

265
00:20:29,611 --> 00:20:31,444
[Gojyo] Shut up, you
stupid monkey!

266
00:20:31,544 --> 00:20:33,377
Hey, don't call me stupid!

267
00:20:33,477 --> 00:20:35,544
[Gojyo] Stop shouting! You're
just making it hotter, dumbass!

268
00:20:35,644 --> 00:20:38,077
[Goku] For a water sprite,
you're not so cool yourself!

269
00:20:38,177 --> 00:20:40,611
[Gojyo] Eat my banana, monkey!
That'll cool you off.

270
00:20:40,711 --> 00:20:43,177
[Goku] That's it! C'mon! We'll
settle this once and for all!

271
00:20:43,277 --> 00:20:45,177
[Sanzo] Shut up, or I'll turn
you all into stone!

272
00:20:45,277 --> 00:20:46,911
[All three] Huh?!

273
00:22:26,177 --> 00:22:29,511
[Goku] Yaone's been captured
by a Special Anti-Demon Unit.

274
00:22:29,611 --> 00:22:32,711
A bounty-hunting team that
specializes in killing demons.

275
00:22:32,811 --> 00:22:34,477
We have to save her!

276
00:22:34,577 --> 00:22:36,477
But if we go rescue Yaone,

277
00:22:36,577 --> 00:22:41,277
we might have to fight an old
friend of Gojyo and Hakkai, who
just joined the bounty hunters.

278
00:22:41,377 --> 00:22:43,211
Well that should make
things interesting.

279
00:22:43,344 --> 00:22:45,977
Found out what happens in,
"The Truth of Justice"

280
00:22:46,077 --> 00:22:49,044
Next time on Saiyuki!
