1
00:01:35,042 --> 00:01:37,802
[Kougaiji] A rumor?
[Yaone] Yes. For the past few
weeks, we have heard the exact

2
00:01:37,802 --> 00:01:40,981
same story coming from several
completely different sources.

3
00:01:40,981 --> 00:01:43,914
Furthermore, we have confirmed
that thirty demons have indeed

4
00:01:44,014 --> 00:01:46,747
gone missing as the rumors
suggest. And just the other

5
00:01:46,847 --> 00:01:50,447
day, eight more demons suddenly
vanished overnight.

6
00:01:50,547 --> 00:01:55,647
[Kougaiji] Eight? Overnight?

7
00:01:55,747 --> 00:01:57,847
Please. Tell me this rumor

8
00:02:01,481 --> 00:02:04,281
[Goku] "The Truth of Justice"

9
00:02:16,781 --> 00:02:18,914
[Man] Help me! Ahhhh!

10
00:02:25,381 --> 00:02:27,781
[Kazuki] Don't look so sad.

11
00:02:27,881 --> 00:02:32,481
The stronger much always
root out the weaker.

12
00:02:32,581 --> 00:02:34,047
It's the natural order.

13
00:02:40,147 --> 00:02:41,347
[Demon] She's a real look-er.

14
00:02:43,447 --> 00:02:44,947
She's got nice legs.

15
00:02:45,047 --> 00:02:46,881
It's not just the legs, it's

16
00:02:46,981 --> 00:02:49,114
the curve from her
neck to her shoul-

17
00:02:59,414 --> 00:03:00,881
Hey!

18
00:03:09,381 --> 00:03:12,214
[Kougaiji] So, what
does this mean?

19
00:03:12,314 --> 00:03:15,981
[Yaone] Lord Kougaiji, I'll
go investigate the matter.

20
00:03:16,081 --> 00:03:19,514
[Kougaiji] No.
[Dokugakuji] Here we go again,
you're so over-protective.

21
00:03:19,614 --> 00:03:22,814
[Kougaiji] I am not!
[Lirin] You never change,
do you, Kougaiji?

22
00:03:24,547 --> 00:03:27,647
At any rate, I think someone
should look into this.

23
00:03:27,747 --> 00:03:32,181
I'm willing to go down and
scout it out, if you'd like.

24
00:03:32,281 --> 00:03:33,847
Check it out, but that's it!

25
00:03:33,947 --> 00:03:39,114
Return as soon as you
find the cause. Reporting
back is your first priority!

26
00:03:39,214 --> 00:03:40,114
I...

27
00:03:40,247 --> 00:03:42,181
[Dokugakuji] Good grief.

28
00:03:46,414 --> 00:03:48,947
It's hot! It's hot! It's hot!

29
00:03:49,047 --> 00:03:51,314
C'mon, when are we going
to get there Hakkai?

30
00:03:51,414 --> 00:03:53,081
[Hakkai] Just a little longer.

31
00:03:53,181 --> 00:03:55,414
A town should be
coming into view soon.

32
00:03:55,514 --> 00:04:00,114
You keep saying that, but
I'm gonna turn into jerky
by the time we get there!

33
00:04:00,214 --> 00:04:04,147
And I doubt anyone would
buy stringy monkey jerky.

34
00:04:04,247 --> 00:04:05,681
Take that back!

35
00:04:05,781 --> 00:04:09,181
How long are we going to be
stuck with this drab view?

36
00:04:09,281 --> 00:04:12,314
Just sky and sand as
far as the eye can see.

37
00:04:12,414 --> 00:04:13,547
Huh?

38
00:04:15,347 --> 00:04:16,981
What the heck is that?

39
00:04:21,614 --> 00:04:25,947
[Gojyo] Boy, you've got
to be devoted to wear that
armor in this weather.

40
00:04:26,047 --> 00:04:28,614
[Goku] Hey, Sanzo, what do
you think they're up to?

41
00:04:28,714 --> 00:04:30,681
[Sanzo] How the
hell should I know?

42
00:04:30,781 --> 00:04:32,714
[Gojyo] Who are
these guys anyway?

43
00:04:32,814 --> 00:04:35,347
They're a sorry-looking
bunch, if you ask me.

44
00:04:35,447 --> 00:04:38,781
They're the Special Anti-
Demon Unit, Huanglong.

45
00:04:38,881 --> 00:04:40,547
[Gojyo] Huanglong?

46
00:04:40,647 --> 00:04:45,181
A private human army that
specializes in fighting demons.

47
00:04:45,281 --> 00:04:48,747
Well, I suppose they're
more like bounty
hunters than an army.

48
00:04:48,847 --> 00:04:51,147
They're a group of mercenaries
who hire out their services

49
00:04:51,247 --> 00:04:52,647
to towns and villages to
solve their demon problems
for them. For a price.

50
00:04:58,547 --> 00:05:00,247
Well let's go. The
marching band's got
nothing to do with us.

51
00:05:01,714 --> 00:05:03,081
We're wasting our time.

52
00:05:03,181 --> 00:05:04,847
[Gojyo & Goku] Okay.

53
00:05:04,947 --> 00:05:09,447
[Tongpu] Hey, Hakkai! Gojyo!

54
00:05:09,547 --> 00:05:11,414
[Goku] Who's that?
[Gojyo] Couldn't say.

55
00:05:11,514 --> 00:05:14,681
They're not the kind of crowd
I usually hang out with, yanno.

56
00:05:14,781 --> 00:05:19,914
Hey guys! Remember me? It's
Tongpu! We used to live
in the same town together!

57
00:05:20,047 --> 00:05:22,714
Tongpu! Is that really
you, my old friend?

58
00:05:22,814 --> 00:05:24,514
Of course it's me, you dope!

59
00:05:24,614 --> 00:05:28,514
Tongpu! You used to play a mean
game of mah-jongg at the parlor!

60
00:05:28,614 --> 00:05:31,481
[Tongpu] Yeah, I'm the one! I'm
glad you guys still remember me!

61
00:05:34,281 --> 00:05:38,214
[Hakkai] So Tongpu, what are
you doing wandering around
the middle of the desert?

62
00:05:38,314 --> 00:05:40,781
After a few thousand games
of mah-jongg, I realized

63
00:05:40,881 --> 00:05:43,114
I didn't want to be stuck
out in the boondocks forever.

64
00:05:43,214 --> 00:05:45,414
Ah yes. Same here.

65
00:05:45,514 --> 00:05:49,147
[Tongpu] I suppose I wanted to
do my part and straighten out
the shit that's been happening.

66
00:05:49,247 --> 00:05:53,114
Maybe make a few bucks too. So I
signed up and joined Huanglong.

67
00:05:53,214 --> 00:05:55,414
I haven't been with
them long, though.

68
00:05:55,514 --> 00:05:58,247
[Soldier] Tongpu, fall
back in formation!

69
00:05:58,347 --> 00:05:59,914
Uh. Yes, Sir!

70
00:06:03,547 --> 00:06:06,147
[Tongpu] Hey, we've still've
a lot of catching up to do,

71
00:06:06,247 --> 00:06:08,647
so how about we get together
tomorrow and do it properly?

72
00:06:08,747 --> 00:06:10,247
It'll be just like the old days!

73
00:06:10,347 --> 00:06:12,481
If I can get some time off.

74
00:06:12,581 --> 00:06:16,847
I know a bar in the next town
with some good home-brewed sake!

75
00:06:16,947 --> 00:06:18,947
[Gojyo] I'm all about that.

76
00:06:19,047 --> 00:06:20,514
[Tongpu] See you tomorrow!

77
00:06:20,614 --> 00:06:22,447
[Gojyo] You bet!

78
00:06:27,314 --> 00:06:31,314
[Goku] Huanglong, huh? They
could have come up with
a better name than that.

79
00:06:31,414 --> 00:06:34,347
[Gojyo] Boy, he sure
hasn't changed at all.

80
00:06:34,447 --> 00:06:35,814
Has he, Hakkai?

81
00:06:35,914 --> 00:06:37,314
[Hakkai] Do you think so?

82
00:06:37,414 --> 00:06:41,614
He never stuck me as the
type who would join a
mercenary outfit.

83
00:06:41,714 --> 00:06:43,981
[Gojyo] You say it like
it's a bad thing.

84
00:06:44,081 --> 00:06:49,114
It's a respectable enough
profession, but it's too much
discipline for my taste though.

85
00:06:50,581 --> 00:06:53,381
So you don't have any
problem with them?

86
00:06:53,481 --> 00:06:56,981
[Sanzo] It just means that
humans aren't going to
take this lying down.

87
00:07:16,581 --> 00:07:18,347
This looks right.

88
00:07:33,547 --> 00:07:35,014
[Yaone gasp]

89
00:07:38,647 --> 00:07:41,847
[Commander] So how do
you like the view?

90
00:07:41,947 --> 00:07:46,247
You've got a lot of guts
coming all the way out here
by yourself, demon woman.

91
00:07:46,347 --> 00:07:50,914
But I'm afraid you ought
to have taken us...
a lot more seriously.

92
00:07:53,747 --> 00:07:58,481
Then again, that might
be too much to ask of
your puny demon brain.

93
00:08:00,047 --> 00:08:04,414
So you are the ones killing
demons that I've been
hearing about.

94
00:08:04,514 --> 00:08:08,981
[Commander] At your service.
We never go hungry, with all
you demons around to slay.

95
00:08:11,181 --> 00:08:14,947
I will not allow you to
get away with this madness.

96
00:08:15,047 --> 00:08:16,281
Get her!

97
00:08:18,181 --> 00:08:19,614
[Yaone] Noooo!

98
00:08:56,847 --> 00:09:00,814
[Footsteps approaching]

99
00:09:00,914 --> 00:09:03,814
[Commander] Awake, are we?

100
00:09:03,914 --> 00:09:06,581
You bastard!

101
00:09:06,681 --> 00:09:08,447
Yes, there you go.

102
00:09:08,547 --> 00:09:11,781
You just struggle all you want.

103
00:09:11,881 --> 00:09:14,647
Talk! I want to know
who you really are!

104
00:09:14,781 --> 00:09:22,247
I can tell just by
looking at you, you're
not just any demon!

105
00:09:22,347 --> 00:09:26,614
Fine. Have it your way.

106
00:09:26,714 --> 00:09:30,147
I would have been disappointed
if you had talked before I got
a chance to have my fun.

107
00:09:33,881 --> 00:09:36,514
[Yaone] Lord Kougaiji...

108
00:09:36,614 --> 00:09:39,614
<i>[Dokugakuji] It's way past</i>
<i>time for her to report</i>
<i>in, what's keeping her?</i>

109
00:09:39,714 --> 00:09:44,381
[Lirin] Kougaiji, do you
think something has happened
to Yaone? Kougaiji!

110
00:09:44,481 --> 00:09:48,614
[Dokugakuji] Hey.

111
00:09:48,714 --> 00:09:52,514
[Kougaiji] Dokugakuji, saddle up
the flight dragon!

112
00:09:58,510 --> 00:10:01,809
[Gojyo] Well then, here's
to a memorable reunion.

113
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:03,709
[Everyone] Cheers!

114
00:10:05,542 --> 00:10:07,509
[Goku] This looks
good! Let's eat!

115
00:10:07,609 --> 00:10:09,809
[Tongpu] So what's it
been now, three years?

116
00:10:09,909 --> 00:10:13,009
[Gojyo] Boy, has it? So, what
have you been up to, Tongpu?

117
00:10:13,109 --> 00:10:16,264
Do you enjoy playing the
proper champion of justice?

118
00:10:16,264 --> 00:10:18,764
[Tongpu] I don't have any
actual combat experience yet.

119
00:10:18,864 --> 00:10:22,864
But, I train everyday.
And they work us like dogs.

120
00:10:22,964 --> 00:10:24,398
Sounds like hard work.

121
00:10:24,531 --> 00:10:26,764
Don't you ever worry that
there are some demons out

122
00:10:26,864 --> 00:10:29,698
there that you don't even
stand a chance against?

123
00:10:29,798 --> 00:10:32,064
No, that's what our
training is for.

124
00:10:32,164 --> 00:10:34,298
Besides, I heard...

125
00:10:34,398 --> 00:10:37,898
I heard a rumor that the
higher-ups have gotten
hold of... something.

126
00:10:37,998 --> 00:10:40,931
A some sort of top
secret weapon.

127
00:10:41,031 --> 00:10:43,898
A top secret weapon, huh?

128
00:10:43,998 --> 00:10:47,198
We're definitely seeing a lot
more demons around here lately.

129
00:10:47,298 --> 00:10:51,198
As a matter of fact, one
demon attacked the camp
just the other evening.

130
00:10:51,298 --> 00:10:53,664
A good looking one too.

131
00:10:53,764 --> 00:10:58,098
But here's the weird
thing. She was walking
through the camp alone.

132
00:10:58,198 --> 00:11:00,298
[Hakkai] Alone?
[Tongpu] Yeah.

133
00:11:00,398 --> 00:11:03,231
She attacked us with
spears and bombs.

134
00:11:03,331 --> 00:11:06,464
Capturing her wasn't
easy, let me tell you.

135
00:11:06,564 --> 00:11:11,998
[Gojyo] Spears and bombs, huh?

136
00:11:12,098 --> 00:11:13,964
[Tongpu] What's wrong?
[Hakkai] Nothing.

137
00:11:14,064 --> 00:11:16,898
I was just wondering what
happened to her. That's all.

138
00:11:16,998 --> 00:11:21,064
[Tongpu] I believe they
took her to a cell somewhere.
Why? Does that bother you?

139
00:11:21,164 --> 00:11:23,731
Well no, not in principle.

140
00:11:23,831 --> 00:11:24,664
[Tongpu] Good, you had me
worried there for a minute.

141
00:11:24,764 --> 00:11:25,764
[Sanzo] Let's get moving.

142
00:11:25,864 --> 00:11:27,498
Hey! I'm not finished yet!

143
00:11:27,598 --> 00:11:29,331
[Gojyo] Just finish
your octopus.

144
00:11:29,431 --> 00:11:31,064
[Goku] That's what I was doing!

145
00:11:31,164 --> 00:11:34,331
[Hakkai] Well it's
been fun, as always.

146
00:11:34,431 --> 00:11:36,398
[Gojyo] It's good to
see you again, Tongpu.

147
00:11:36,498 --> 00:11:38,164
[Tongpu] You're still
gonna be in town, right?

148
00:11:38,264 --> 00:11:40,231
[Gojyo] Yeah, I'll
see you around.

149
00:11:46,264 --> 00:11:48,431
[Gojyo] Yaone, right?

150
00:11:48,531 --> 00:11:50,231
[Sanzo] Undoubtedly.

151
00:11:50,331 --> 00:11:52,231
[Goku] What? Really?!

152
00:11:52,331 --> 00:11:54,231
[Gojyo] Moron. Where
have you been?

153
00:11:54,331 --> 00:11:57,764
[Goku] I'm sorry! I can't
help it! I didn't notice!

154
00:11:57,864 --> 00:11:59,864
[Gojyo] That's why
you're a monkey.

155
00:11:59,964 --> 00:12:02,764
[Goku] What's that
supposed to mean?

156
00:12:05,331 --> 00:12:09,098
[Sanzo] You're going, aren't
you? You do realize that if you

157
00:12:09,198 --> 00:12:12,064
go, you might end up having
to fight your friend.

158
00:12:16,498 --> 00:12:19,764
[Hakkai] I'm not sure
what I'm going to do.

159
00:12:19,864 --> 00:12:23,631
I know Yaone is technically
our enemy, and perhaps it

160
00:12:23,731 --> 00:12:26,164
isn't my place to get
involved in this.

161
00:12:26,264 --> 00:12:28,164
But...

162
00:12:29,998 --> 00:12:34,531
I couldn't live with myself if
I left without doing something.

163
00:12:34,631 --> 00:12:39,064
Besides, if I go, there's
no guarantee that I'd
have to fight Tongpu.

164
00:12:39,164 --> 00:12:43,731
[Hakkai] And so...
[Gojyo] You want us to
come with you, right?

165
00:12:43,831 --> 00:12:47,531
[Goku] Isn't that right, Hakkai?

166
00:12:47,631 --> 00:12:51,131
[Hakkai] Right!
[Gojyo] Well, now
that's decided.

167
00:12:51,231 --> 00:12:52,331
Let's go raid us a camp.

168
00:12:52,431 --> 00:12:53,264
[Sanzo] Wait.

169
00:12:53,364 --> 00:12:56,498
[Goku] What? Sanzo...

170
00:12:58,098 --> 00:13:00,364
I think we should
sneak in at night.

171
00:13:00,464 --> 00:13:05,664
Best not to take any
unnecessary chances with
these two idiots in tow.

172
00:13:05,764 --> 00:13:07,331
Right.

173
00:13:07,431 --> 00:13:10,098
[Gojyo] Haha, you hear that?
He called you an idiot.

174
00:13:10,198 --> 00:13:11,998
[Goku] He called you one too!

175
00:13:12,131 --> 00:13:14,931
[Gojyo] What?! Hey Sanzo, what
do you mean TWO idiots?!

176
00:13:15,031 --> 00:13:15,998
[Sanzo] Exactly what
it sounds like.

177
00:13:22,431 --> 00:13:25,831
I believe this is
the place, huh?

178
00:13:25,931 --> 00:13:28,298
[Gojyo] Quite an operation
they got going here.

179
00:13:28,398 --> 00:13:30,931
It won't be easy tracking
down one person.

180
00:13:31,031 --> 00:13:32,498
[Goku] So, what's the plan?

181
00:13:32,598 --> 00:13:34,264
[Hakkai] Let's split
up and search for her.

182
00:13:34,364 --> 00:13:36,531
We won't stand out
so much that way.

183
00:13:36,631 --> 00:13:39,264
[Gojyo] Okay. I'll check
you guys later.

184
00:13:41,531 --> 00:13:42,198
[Goku] Shit!

185
00:13:42,298 --> 00:13:43,264
[Soldier] Who's there?!

186
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:46,698
[Loud thud]

187
00:13:46,798 --> 00:13:50,864
[Gojyo] Hey, monkey. The
idea was to sneak in here,

188
00:13:50,964 --> 00:13:53,698
not barge in and cause a ruckus.

189
00:13:53,798 --> 00:13:55,398
Do you comprende?

190
00:13:55,498 --> 00:13:57,331
[Goku] I know that!

191
00:13:57,431 --> 00:13:59,598
[Gojyo] You know what,
I don't think you do.

192
00:13:59,698 --> 00:14:01,698
[Goku] Look, I don't need
to hear it from you!

193
00:14:04,364 --> 00:14:08,631
[Tongpu] Hakkai?

194
00:14:08,731 --> 00:14:10,464
[Hakkai] Tongpu...

195
00:14:10,564 --> 00:14:13,164
[Tongpu] What're you doing here?

196
00:14:13,264 --> 00:14:16,531
[Hakkai] I, uh...

197
00:14:16,631 --> 00:14:18,331
[Tongpu] You're not here to...
[Hakkai] To what?

198
00:14:27,198 --> 00:14:29,931
[Hakkai] Sorry friend, but
I'm in a hurry. I'm sorry.

199
00:14:42,064 --> 00:14:43,964
Yaone!

200
00:14:57,698 --> 00:15:00,431
[Dokugakuji] Kou, be
careful. These guys know
what they're doing.

201
00:15:01,698 --> 00:15:03,598
[Kougaiji] Yaone!

202
00:15:09,831 --> 00:15:13,264
[Yaone] What are you doing here?

203
00:15:13,364 --> 00:15:16,864
We can talk later. Right
now, let's get out of here.

204
00:15:21,431 --> 00:15:23,464
This... This is...

205
00:15:23,564 --> 00:15:24,898
Horrible.

206
00:15:28,098 --> 00:15:30,398
[Goku] Hey... Kougaiji!

207
00:15:30,498 --> 00:15:32,131
[Gojyo] What?

208
00:15:38,031 --> 00:15:40,231
Take me to Yaone.

209
00:15:40,331 --> 00:15:41,831
[Commander] I don't
know who that is.

210
00:15:41,931 --> 00:15:46,331
That's too bad for you. Now I
have no use for you anymore.

211
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:48,031
[Hakkai] Yaone is right here.

212
00:15:53,331 --> 00:15:54,631
[Dokugakuji] Not you again.

213
00:15:54,731 --> 00:15:56,064
[Kougaiji] Yaone?

214
00:15:56,164 --> 00:16:00,031
[Sanzo] I believe you came
here for Yaone. Here she is.

215
00:16:00,131 --> 00:16:01,964
[Kougaiji] Why if
it isn't Sanzo.

216
00:16:02,064 --> 00:16:03,964
[Lirin] And the
droopy-eyed monkey!

217
00:16:04,064 --> 00:16:08,298
[Sanzo] If you want
her, take her. This fight
is as good as over.

218
00:16:08,398 --> 00:16:11,264
It appears we like to
frequent the same hangouts.

219
00:16:11,364 --> 00:16:15,098
Very well then. I suggest you
hand Yaone over right now!

220
00:16:15,198 --> 00:16:18,564
Okay. I'm coming. Let's
just take this slow and-

221
00:16:30,598 --> 00:16:32,498
T-Tongpu...

222
00:16:34,731 --> 00:16:36,298
This is all your fault!

223
00:16:36,398 --> 00:16:38,798
Tongpu, you damn bastard!

224
00:16:38,898 --> 00:16:40,731
You're dead meat, buddy!

225
00:16:40,831 --> 00:16:42,698
[Hakkai] It's all right!

226
00:16:42,798 --> 00:16:44,731
[Goku] Ha-Hakkai...

227
00:16:44,831 --> 00:16:46,498
I'm so sorry...

228
00:16:48,331 --> 00:16:51,698
[Tongpu] What the hell
is wrong with you guys?!
Helping demon scum?!

229
00:16:51,798 --> 00:16:55,264
Just whose side you think
you're on anyway?!

230
00:16:56,431 --> 00:16:58,498
We don't fight for either side.

231
00:16:58,598 --> 00:17:01,264
I... was just..

232
00:17:01,364 --> 00:17:04,898
I was just trying to
help a dear friend of
mine who was in trouble.

233
00:17:08,931 --> 00:17:10,398
[Goku] Hakkai!

234
00:17:10,498 --> 00:17:14,864
[Hakkai] Kougaiji, I believe
I have returnedYaone to you.

235
00:17:15,998 --> 00:17:17,464
Yeah.

236
00:17:19,431 --> 00:17:20,931
[Gojyo] Uh oh.

237
00:17:26,698 --> 00:17:29,164
Did you know the one who's
been bathed in the blood

238
00:17:29,264 --> 00:17:33,331
of a thousand demons becomes
a demon himself?! It doesn't

239
00:17:33,431 --> 00:17:36,864
matter how much! Bathe in
it and this is what you get!

240
00:17:38,864 --> 00:17:40,064
Say your prayers!

241
00:17:40,564 --> 00:17:41,998
He's a monster!

242
00:17:42,098 --> 00:17:44,031
Who's the demon now?

243
00:17:44,131 --> 00:17:47,798
It's your own fault
for being too soft and
weak to finish me off.

244
00:17:47,898 --> 00:17:50,831
Now you can all prepare
to join each other in hell!

245
00:17:55,998 --> 00:17:57,531
He's gone insane.

246
00:17:57,631 --> 00:17:59,464
Goku, Gojyo, let's go!

247
00:17:59,564 --> 00:18:03,531
You guys stand back. We can take
care of this guy, no problem.

248
00:18:03,631 --> 00:18:05,698
What're you planning?

249
00:18:05,798 --> 00:18:08,764
I intend to repay an old debt.

250
00:18:08,864 --> 00:18:10,364
[Goku] You gotta be joking!

251
00:18:10,464 --> 00:18:12,531
[Gojyo] And let you
guys have all the fun?

252
00:18:20,164 --> 00:18:22,064
Eugh, melting stuff?!

253
00:18:27,931 --> 00:18:29,398
[Goku] Damn it!

254
00:18:29,498 --> 00:18:31,564
[Gojyo] Don't let down
your guard, Monkey!

255
00:18:31,664 --> 00:18:33,564
[Lirin] That's why we told
you to leave it to us!

256
00:18:34,564 --> 00:18:36,064
Hiiiiiiii-yah!

257
00:18:50,098 --> 00:18:53,464
[Tongpu] Hakkai...
Why did you save me?

258
00:18:53,564 --> 00:18:58,431
I though I told you.
I don't fight on the
side of humans or demons.

259
00:18:58,531 --> 00:19:04,564
Besides you... were kind enough
not to hit anything vital.

260
00:19:04,664 --> 00:19:07,364
Now, shall we settle this?

261
00:19:14,264 --> 00:19:15,998
[Sanzo] Hakkai!

262
00:19:16,098 --> 00:19:19,131
Will you please return to
the darkness so that you

263
00:19:19,264 --> 00:19:22,464
can be with the souls of
all the demons you killed!

264
00:19:40,772 --> 00:19:42,452
[Yaone] There, that
ought to do it.

265
00:19:42,452 --> 00:19:45,286
You should be fine by next week.

266
00:19:45,386 --> 00:19:48,386
[Hakkai] Thank you so much.
[Yaone] Not problem.

267
00:19:48,486 --> 00:19:52,286
I'll thank you for what
you did today, but the
next time we meet again-

268
00:19:52,386 --> 00:19:56,252
[Gojyo] We know, we know, we're
tired of hearing that already.

269
00:19:56,352 --> 00:19:59,152
[Goku] Fighting would be
awkward right now anyway.

270
00:19:59,252 --> 00:20:01,419
[Dokugakuji] Yeah, it just
wouldn't feel right.

271
00:20:01,519 --> 00:20:04,686
[Lirin] Hey, droopy-eyes,
we'll play again later, okay?

272
00:20:04,786 --> 00:20:07,986
[Sanzo] Will you go home
already, you little brat.

273
00:20:08,086 --> 00:20:11,119
Yaone, it's time to go!

274
00:20:11,219 --> 00:20:14,252
[Yaone] Thank you, Hakkai.

275
00:20:14,352 --> 00:20:16,086
My pleasure, Yaone.

276
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:21,952
[Sanzo] Come on, let's go!

277
00:20:25,319 --> 00:20:27,152
[Sanzo] You shouldn't listen
to other people who tell you

278
00:20:27,252 --> 00:20:31,386
who your friends and
enemies are. Much less
let them decide for you.

279
00:20:31,486 --> 00:20:34,452
It's hard enough figuring
out that for yourself.

280
00:20:34,552 --> 00:20:36,452
Don't you think?

281
00:22:25,752 --> 00:22:27,686
[Sanzo] A sorrowful encounter.

282
00:22:27,786 --> 00:22:30,052
A future that cannot be changed.

283
00:22:30,152 --> 00:22:33,519
A past that cannot
be taken back.

284
00:22:33,619 --> 00:22:36,586
There is but one small
uncertain hope for us
to put our faith into.

285
00:22:38,419 --> 00:22:42,219
Does the path lead
to light or darkness?

286
00:22:42,352 --> 00:22:44,986
There's only one way
to know for sure.

287
00:22:45,086 --> 00:22:47,019
Watch "Maidens of Sorrow",
next time on Saiyuki.
