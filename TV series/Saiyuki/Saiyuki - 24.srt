1
00:01:40,368 --> 00:01:43,968
[Ni] I see why you're
so cold, Dr. Huang.

2
00:01:43,968 --> 00:01:46,968
You get all your
sexual gratification
from your computer.

3
00:01:48,135 --> 00:01:49,768
Where else would I find it?

4
00:01:52,902 --> 00:01:55,635
Are you going to tell me
what's in the box or what?

5
00:01:55,735 --> 00:02:00,368
Just something my brain came up
to play with people's hearts.

6
00:02:00,468 --> 00:02:01,835
If they do have them.

7
00:02:07,435 --> 00:02:08,902
[Goku] "Blood Bond."

8
00:02:27,135 --> 00:02:29,535
[Gojyo] Finally. I thought
we'd never get there.

9
00:02:29,635 --> 00:02:32,102
[Goku] And you know
what that means. Food!

10
00:02:32,202 --> 00:02:36,202
[Hakkai] I'm afraid it's
not dinner time yet, but our
legs could all use a stretch.

11
00:02:36,302 --> 00:02:39,302
[Goku] Please! I'm
dying over here!

12
00:02:39,402 --> 00:02:42,635
[Gojyo] You, dying of hunger?
That I'd like to see.

13
00:02:44,068 --> 00:02:45,802
What's wrong? Goku?

14
00:02:50,002 --> 00:02:50,968
Goku!

15
00:02:51,068 --> 00:02:52,702
I'll go get you some
food right away!

16
00:02:52,802 --> 00:02:55,868
Just hold on! Don't
die on me, monkey!

17
00:02:57,902 --> 00:03:00,968
In that case, I'll
take some pot stickers!

18
00:03:05,235 --> 00:03:06,735
[Huang] Dr. Ni...

19
00:03:06,868 --> 00:03:08,935
I admit that you
are a great scientist,

20
00:03:09,035 --> 00:03:12,002
perhaps even one of the
greatest in the world...

21
00:03:12,102 --> 00:03:16,335
Hear that, bunny?
She really likes us.

22
00:03:16,435 --> 00:03:19,968
[Huang] But we are in the
service of Lady Gyokumen Koushu.

23
00:03:20,068 --> 00:03:21,635
To act on our own would be...

24
00:03:21,735 --> 00:03:27,168
Is it true you were
class president of
your elementary school?

25
00:03:27,268 --> 00:03:28,602
I don't understand.

26
00:03:30,668 --> 00:03:32,302
A bull's eye.

27
00:03:32,402 --> 00:03:35,102
A spring of knowledge
that bubbles up in a

28
00:03:35,202 --> 00:03:38,002
desert of incompetence,
chaos, and ignorance,

29
00:03:38,102 --> 00:03:42,868
[Ni] will eventually be
swallowed up by the dry sand.
[Huang] Pardon?

30
00:03:42,968 --> 00:03:48,535
Even if a single woman should
try desperately to drink some
of that superior knowledge,

31
00:03:48,635 --> 00:03:52,168
that spring would have to
conserve some of it's water

32
00:03:52,268 --> 00:03:55,768
for all the others who
are dying of thirst.

33
00:03:55,868 --> 00:03:57,635
Oh, for crying out loud!

34
00:03:57,735 --> 00:04:00,802
Are you the spring
in this scenario?

35
00:04:00,902 --> 00:04:06,502
[Ni] All I'm saying is that
I don't want to be sucked into
the desert without reason.

36
00:04:06,602 --> 00:04:08,668
May I present my queen bee.

37
00:04:08,768 --> 00:04:11,968
A little hobby I've been
working on during my off hours.

38
00:04:13,302 --> 00:04:17,035
You aren't intending to
use that on Genjo Sanzo...

39
00:04:17,135 --> 00:04:19,202
without proper approval?

40
00:04:19,302 --> 00:04:21,768
Are you always such
a fuddy-duddy?

41
00:04:23,235 --> 00:04:26,835
Okay! It's time for you to go
round up your worker buddies.

42
00:04:28,302 --> 00:04:29,435
Bye-bye.

43
00:04:41,202 --> 00:04:45,868
[Hakkai] Bad news. It doesn't
look like this inn serves meals.
[Goku] What?!

44
00:04:45,968 --> 00:04:49,268
[Hakkai] A drought has
apaprently put this village
into a nasty famine.

45
00:04:51,035 --> 00:04:54,135
Hey, Gojyo. Why don't you
make yourself useful and
get us something to eat.

46
00:04:54,235 --> 00:04:56,535
What? And why me?!

47
00:04:56,635 --> 00:05:00,402
[Sanzo] Didn't I hear you tell
Goku a little while ago that
you'd go get us some food?

48
00:05:00,502 --> 00:05:02,102
[Goku] Yeah!

49
00:05:02,202 --> 00:05:05,168
But only because that
little monkey tricked me!

50
00:05:05,268 --> 00:05:06,868
[Sanzo] A real man never
goes back on his word.

51
00:05:07,702 --> 00:05:08,502
You're serious.

52
00:05:08,602 --> 00:05:09,602
So long, Gojyo.

53
00:05:11,435 --> 00:05:13,002
[Gojyo] Fine, I'll do it.

54
00:05:14,802 --> 00:05:16,168
And you're going with me!

55
00:05:25,268 --> 00:05:28,035
Man, I tell you. This
place is one big hellhole.

56
00:05:37,902 --> 00:05:40,735
[Yanming] Please, just
a little? That's all I ask!

57
00:05:40,835 --> 00:05:45,068
[Shopkeep] Go home! I have
nothing I'm willing to sell
to the likes of you!

58
00:05:45,168 --> 00:05:47,168
[Yanming] But I could give you
this! Please! It's all I have-

59
00:05:48,002 --> 00:05:48,668
[Shopkeep] GET OUT!

60
00:05:51,335 --> 00:05:54,968
I'd sooner give food to the
dogs than sell any to you!

61
00:05:55,068 --> 00:05:57,202
I beg you! Please help me!

62
00:05:57,302 --> 00:06:00,468
[Gojyo] Hey, Mister, that's
no way to woo a lady.

63
00:06:01,335 --> 00:06:02,835
You get-!

64
00:06:04,335 --> 00:06:07,935
Your hair... The
color... of your eyes...

65
00:06:08,035 --> 00:06:09,168
[Goyjo] Huh?

66
00:06:13,402 --> 00:06:14,902
[Shopkeep] Here! Go!

67
00:06:17,568 --> 00:06:19,402
What the...?

68
00:06:19,502 --> 00:06:21,568
It looks like it's
free today, beautiful.

69
00:06:29,835 --> 00:06:31,868
Truth now. Are my looks
that intimidating?

70
00:06:31,968 --> 00:06:34,302
Yeah, like you're
after something.

71
00:06:34,402 --> 00:06:36,802
Ah, dammit. Was I
thought obvious?

72
00:06:37,968 --> 00:06:39,268
[Goku] What now?

73
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:44,802
I guess we just move on.

74
00:06:54,035 --> 00:06:57,035
[Ni] Oh, very nice!

75
00:06:57,135 --> 00:07:01,002
This village is a virtual
hotbed of hatred and fear.

76
00:07:01,135 --> 00:07:03,102
My kind of town.

77
00:07:09,535 --> 00:07:13,302
[Goku] There's gotta
be some place around
here with some food.

78
00:07:13,402 --> 00:07:14,902
I'm famished!

79
00:07:15,002 --> 00:07:16,168
[Goyjo] Get a hold of
yourself, will ya?

80
00:07:18,102 --> 00:07:19,768
What is it?

81
00:07:29,835 --> 00:07:33,035
I'll be. That lady again.

82
00:07:33,135 --> 00:07:35,235
Do I still look intimidating?

83
00:07:35,335 --> 00:07:37,002
You do.

84
00:07:37,502 --> 00:07:38,968
Sweet.

85
00:07:40,968 --> 00:07:43,868
I'm sorry for how
I acted before.

86
00:07:43,968 --> 00:07:47,302
No biggie. Though I'm not use
to chicks running away from me.

87
00:07:47,402 --> 00:07:51,835
When I saw you, I was so
stunned. I wasn't able
to think very clearly.

88
00:07:51,935 --> 00:07:55,835
You know, I felt the
exact same way when I
saw your beautiful eyes.

89
00:07:55,935 --> 00:07:57,168
What's your name?

90
00:07:57,268 --> 00:07:58,935
Yanming...

91
00:07:59,035 --> 00:08:02,368
Well Yanming, call me Gojyo.

92
00:08:02,468 --> 00:08:05,768
Jeez. Get a room
for crying out loud.

93
00:08:14,602 --> 00:08:17,335
[Yanming] Burning red...
the color of...

94
00:08:18,402 --> 00:08:20,202
A mongrel birth.

95
00:08:22,268 --> 00:08:25,335
Your hair and eyes betray
the forbidden union of

96
00:08:25,435 --> 00:08:28,068
one parent human,
the other demon.

97
00:08:50,968 --> 00:08:53,302
[Shopkeep] I tell
you, I saw him!

98
00:08:53,402 --> 00:08:55,935
[Innkeep] That witch
has brought in others?!

99
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:57,702
We can't allow this to happen!

100
00:08:57,802 --> 00:08:59,635
There's no telling
what they'll do!

101
00:09:00,202 --> 00:09:01,668
Half-breeds!

102
00:09:01,768 --> 00:09:03,468
Go gather the others.

103
00:09:03,568 --> 00:09:05,168
[Shopkeep] Don't you
have any customers?

104
00:09:05,268 --> 00:09:07,202
[Innkeep] Just a shady
monk and his party.

105
00:09:07,302 --> 00:09:08,535
Nothing to worry
about. Let's go!

106
00:09:10,768 --> 00:09:12,968
You think something happened?

107
00:09:13,068 --> 00:09:15,868
Who knows? They sure are taking
their sweet time about it.

108
00:09:17,168 --> 00:09:21,202
Knowing Gojyo, he's probably
using Goku to pick up women.

109
00:09:21,302 --> 00:09:23,802
He'd be better off
with a dog. Woof.

110
00:09:25,268 --> 00:09:27,568
I'm so starving.

111
00:09:27,668 --> 00:09:30,135
[Hakkai] What do you
know? Welcome back.

112
00:09:30,235 --> 00:09:31,868
[Sanzo] Where's Gojyo?

113
00:09:41,468 --> 00:09:44,802
[Gojyo] So, it had nothing to do
with my piercing good looks, eh?

114
00:09:46,668 --> 00:09:47,935
I'll get over it.

115
00:09:48,035 --> 00:09:51,168
[Yanming] I'm sorry, but
seeing you did give me hope

116
00:09:51,268 --> 00:09:55,335
my child could grow
up to be respectable.

117
00:09:55,435 --> 00:09:57,635
Respectable, huh? Yeah.

118
00:09:59,935 --> 00:10:02,135
I don't know about that.

119
00:10:02,235 --> 00:10:05,668
I am alive, I suppose.
And that's something.

120
00:10:09,768 --> 00:10:12,302
So, where's the boyfriend, huh?

121
00:10:12,402 --> 00:10:15,835
Things were fine,
until one day, he...

122
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:18,702
he just changed into a madman!

123
00:10:18,802 --> 00:10:21,235
[Gojyo] So it's the
same here too.

124
00:10:21,368 --> 00:10:25,468
One day, he just left.
And that's the last
we ever saw of him.

125
00:10:25,568 --> 00:10:30,902
I'm... I just really don't
know why. At first, the
others were kind to me.

126
00:10:31,002 --> 00:10:33,368
And they told me
it wasn't my fault.

127
00:10:34,535 --> 00:10:36,868
But I was with child...

128
00:10:38,802 --> 00:10:40,602
And I knew there was no
way they could accept him.

129
00:10:40,702 --> 00:10:44,268
A baby with eyes
as red as the sunset.

130
00:10:44,368 --> 00:10:50,435
But I also knew that... that I
could never give up such a...

131
00:10:50,535 --> 00:10:54,502
beautiful, beautiful child.

132
00:10:54,635 --> 00:10:56,535
[Gojyo] I can't stand
to see a woman cry.

133
00:10:58,702 --> 00:11:01,635
Everytime my mother
saw me, she cried too.

134
00:11:09,568 --> 00:11:11,435
Why not just leave?

135
00:11:11,535 --> 00:11:14,968
I can't. I've never known
any place else.

136
00:11:15,068 --> 00:11:16,802
Besides, I must wait for him.

137
00:11:19,068 --> 00:11:20,468
[Innkeep] There she is!

138
00:11:20,568 --> 00:11:23,768
[Shopkeep] I told you
if we let her stay here,
others would follow!

139
00:11:23,868 --> 00:11:25,435
[Innkeep] They're not
welcome here.

140
00:11:26,568 --> 00:11:28,302
I wonder what they want?

141
00:11:29,335 --> 00:11:32,635
<i>[Gojyo] Oh boy, this</i>
<i>sure brings me back.</i>

142
00:11:39,844 --> 00:11:42,510
[The townspeople
mutter in disgust]

143
00:11:55,844 --> 00:11:56,877
I'll be...

144
00:11:56,977 --> 00:12:00,377
the perfect intersection
of sorrow and hatred.

145
00:12:00,477 --> 00:12:03,044
Hurry, queen bee.
Show them your sting.

146
00:12:12,644 --> 00:12:13,677
Hungry...

147
00:12:13,777 --> 00:12:16,310
I think Gojyo's set
a new record.

148
00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:18,444
His relationships
never last this long.

149
00:12:18,544 --> 00:12:21,844
Let's go. I'm out of cigarettes.

150
00:12:21,944 --> 00:12:26,344
[Innkeep] She's
improving. At least now
she's dating half humans.

151
00:12:26,444 --> 00:12:28,944
[Villager] Show them a little
kindness, and they take
advantage of you!

152
00:12:29,044 --> 00:12:31,310
[Shopkeep] We won't make
that mistake again!

153
00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:35,310
<i>What a bunch of assholes.</i>

154
00:12:35,444 --> 00:12:37,910
You're all wrong! He's
not here because of me!

155
00:12:38,010 --> 00:12:40,577
[Innkeep] We're not going
to fall for it, demon lover!

156
00:12:40,677 --> 00:12:43,044
[Villager] We won't let
you run us out of town!

157
00:12:43,144 --> 00:12:45,744
Ever since you gave
birth to that monster,

158
00:12:45,844 --> 00:12:50,010
our village hasn't seen
a single drop of rain!
Our wells dried up!

159
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:54,944
Nearby villagers are too afraid
of the curse of the red-eyed
baby to come near us!

160
00:12:55,044 --> 00:12:56,677
This is all because of you!

161
00:12:56,777 --> 00:12:58,510
But you've got it all wrong!

162
00:12:58,610 --> 00:13:02,277
It's not you, disasters are
happening all around Shangri-La.

163
00:13:02,377 --> 00:13:05,444
[Villager] Like we're going to
believe a demon spawn like you!

164
00:13:05,544 --> 00:13:06,944
[Gojyo] Real bright, numb-nuts.

165
00:13:07,044 --> 00:13:09,244
[Innkeep] You going to fight
or what?! Enough talk!

166
00:13:09,377 --> 00:13:10,377
[Villager] Get out
of our village!

167
00:13:10,477 --> 00:13:13,244
Stop it! What have we ever
done to hurt you?!

168
00:13:16,544 --> 00:13:22,010
You see, sorrow is hatred my
pet. Two sides of a coin.

169
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:25,077
Release the pain that's
festering in you.

170
00:13:26,677 --> 00:13:28,510
What's going on, Yanming?

171
00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:30,177
What is it? What?

172
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:33,577
Yanming!

173
00:13:45,844 --> 00:13:49,010
I feel as if I have been reborn.

174
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:50,244
Huh?!

175
00:13:52,310 --> 00:13:53,544
Yanming!

176
00:13:53,644 --> 00:13:54,544
[Villager] What is it?!

177
00:13:54,644 --> 00:13:57,010
So she really was a
demon, a monster.

178
00:13:58,677 --> 00:14:01,044
You will pay for what
you have done to me!

179
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:06,477
Yanming, that's enough!

180
00:14:06,577 --> 00:14:07,277
No it's not!

181
00:14:07,377 --> 00:14:08,944
Eat this, you bitch!

182
00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:12,210
Idiots! Cease fire!

183
00:14:16,377 --> 00:14:17,510
Dammit!

184
00:14:22,577 --> 00:14:23,877
Goku, stop!

185
00:14:23,977 --> 00:14:26,144
Where's my dinner, you slut?

186
00:14:26,244 --> 00:14:27,810
Can I bum a smoke?

187
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:29,144
If you're through
cracking jokes,

188
00:14:29,244 --> 00:14:30,410
I could use a little help.

189
00:14:31,610 --> 00:14:34,644
[Goku] Hey! Is that the
same woman from before?!

190
00:14:34,744 --> 00:14:36,810
Gojyo, what's happening?!

191
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:40,110
I don't know, but she must be
human because I never sensed

192
00:14:40,210 --> 00:14:42,644
any kind of demon
aura coming from her.

193
00:14:42,744 --> 00:14:46,010
Mess with me and
I'll destroy you too!

194
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:48,710
Sounds fun, lady!
Wanna wrastle?

195
00:14:48,810 --> 00:14:51,410
[Gojyo] Stay out of this!
Listen! Attacking the

196
00:14:51,510 --> 00:14:53,910
villagers isn't going to
solve your problems!

197
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:57,144
Demon halfbreed!

198
00:14:57,244 --> 00:14:59,344
You more than anybody
should know the kind of

199
00:14:59,444 --> 00:15:02,177
existence in store
for a mongrel!

200
00:15:07,477 --> 00:15:09,110
A baby?

201
00:15:10,644 --> 00:15:12,310
<i>[Sanzo] So that's it?</i>

202
00:15:12,410 --> 00:15:16,277
That baby is the reason
for their hatred of me!

203
00:15:16,377 --> 00:15:18,610
If only he never existed!

204
00:15:28,877 --> 00:15:30,510
If he never existed!

205
00:15:33,277 --> 00:15:35,344
You know that isn't true !

206
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:41,544
Gojyo, what're you doing?!

207
00:15:42,077 --> 00:15:43,710
Sanzo!

208
00:15:47,344 --> 00:15:48,710
Out of the way!

209
00:15:48,810 --> 00:15:51,977
[Gojyo] Stop it! I've suffered
enough for the two of us!

210
00:15:56,944 --> 00:16:00,110
No mother ever thinks
their own child is ugly.

211
00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:03,244
Isn't that right?!

212
00:16:15,844 --> 00:16:17,477
Gojyo, please. I...

213
00:16:18,777 --> 00:16:21,477
[Gojyo] Isn't that
right, Yanming?

214
00:16:21,577 --> 00:16:23,344
[Yanming] Please run, Gojyo!

215
00:16:24,144 --> 00:16:25,344
[Gojyo] Yanming.

216
00:16:25,444 --> 00:16:27,644
[Yanming] There's nothing
I can do anymore!

217
00:16:28,377 --> 00:16:29,910
Don't be stupid!

218
00:16:30,044 --> 00:16:32,944
[Yanming] I don't
want to hurt my baby!

219
00:16:33,044 --> 00:16:37,844
But I can't control my hatred!
My body has a will of its own!

220
00:16:39,277 --> 00:16:40,410
That's it!

221
00:16:41,310 --> 00:16:42,710
[Gojyo] You can fight it!

222
00:16:42,810 --> 00:16:45,810
[Yanming] I... I...

223
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:49,644
I will kill everyone who
tries to stand in my way.

224
00:16:49,744 --> 00:16:50,877
[Gojyo] Oh no.

225
00:16:54,777 --> 00:16:57,444
Gojyo! So what do we do?

226
00:16:57,544 --> 00:16:59,477
We have to kill her!

227
00:16:59,577 --> 00:17:00,877
[Gojyo] Stay out of this!

228
00:17:03,077 --> 00:17:06,144
I won't let you hurt her!

229
00:17:06,244 --> 00:17:08,944
Yanming is the only
mother he has!

230
00:17:09,044 --> 00:17:12,210
I won't let this baby
suffer the way I suffered!

231
00:17:12,310 --> 00:17:15,944
Who else would take care
of a mongrel baby like this,
if not his own mother?

232
00:17:16,044 --> 00:17:17,544
His own mother!

233
00:17:22,777 --> 00:17:24,410
Nice try!

234
00:17:30,344 --> 00:17:31,477
Look out!

235
00:17:38,444 --> 00:17:40,110
What's happening?!

236
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:43,344
I can't tell...

237
00:17:51,144 --> 00:17:52,777
[Goku] Gojyo!

238
00:18:11,877 --> 00:18:15,077
[Goku] Gojyo! Are
you alright? Gojyo!

239
00:18:15,177 --> 00:18:17,310
It's okay. He's alive.

240
00:18:19,677 --> 00:18:22,477
So you did notice it.

241
00:18:22,577 --> 00:18:25,044
Looks like it.

242
00:18:25,144 --> 00:18:28,544
Am I the only one who
hasn't figured out
what's going on here?

243
00:18:28,644 --> 00:18:29,677
Look here.

244
00:18:29,777 --> 00:18:32,710
This is what has been
controlling Yanming.

245
00:18:32,810 --> 00:18:35,010
[Goku] Oooh.

246
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:38,010
[Hakkai] By luring her to
attack him, it provided Gojyo

247
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:40,344
with the opportunity
to grab it from her neck.

248
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:46,144
That's so smart!

249
00:18:46,244 --> 00:18:52,277
I have to agree. It goes to
show you, you can't judge
a book by its cover.

250
00:19:01,044 --> 00:19:03,244
Non-perishables go there.

251
00:19:03,344 --> 00:19:05,510
Aye, aye, miss president.

252
00:19:05,610 --> 00:19:07,944
And please stop calling me that!

253
00:19:18,306 --> 00:19:20,146
[Gojyo] Guess this
is goodbye, beautiful.

254
00:19:20,146 --> 00:19:22,146
[Goku] Are you going
to be alright by yourself?

255
00:19:22,246 --> 00:19:26,246
I won't ever be alone.
Not if I have him.

256
00:19:26,346 --> 00:19:29,412
Are you sure now? It's
a harsh world out there.

257
00:19:29,512 --> 00:19:35,712
[Yanming] Maybe so, but the
best way to prepare him for
that is to be strong myself.

258
00:19:35,812 --> 00:19:38,246
What kind of mother would I
be if I taught him to be afraid?

259
00:19:38,346 --> 00:19:44,279
I'm sad to be leaving my
village, but it would be best
for my son if I find his father.

260
00:19:44,379 --> 00:19:46,679
[Goku] You realize
that in Shangri-La...

261
00:19:46,779 --> 00:19:50,246
Push come to shove, and I'll
turn into the bee woman again.

262
00:19:50,346 --> 00:19:53,412
Huh? Those stingers really hurt.

263
00:19:53,979 --> 00:19:55,612
I'm sorry.

264
00:20:03,179 --> 00:20:05,379
[Koushu] Ni! I know
you're around here!

265
00:20:06,412 --> 00:20:09,079
Yes, Lady Gyokumen Koushu?

266
00:20:09,179 --> 00:20:10,179
There you are.

267
00:20:10,279 --> 00:20:14,379
[Ni] You're always in
my thoughts, My Lady.

268
00:20:14,479 --> 00:20:16,912
I'm bored, Ni. So bored.

269
00:20:17,012 --> 00:20:20,212
[Ni] My, that IS a
problem now, isn't it?

270
00:20:20,312 --> 00:20:23,246
Do you have something
to amuse me?

271
00:20:23,346 --> 00:20:26,679
Uh... I'm afraid I have
not time for frivolities

272
00:20:26,779 --> 00:20:30,046
since I devote myself to
serving you, your highness.

273
00:20:30,146 --> 00:20:32,912
Well then, I have
a favor to ask you.

274
00:20:33,779 --> 00:20:35,379
I'm feeling a little parched.

275
00:20:35,479 --> 00:20:38,446
Then I'll go fetch
you something.

276
00:20:38,546 --> 00:20:42,212
[Koushu] Yes, this dry desert of
ignorance would love a chance to

277
00:20:42,312 --> 00:20:45,212
lap at your fountain.

278
00:20:45,312 --> 00:20:46,946
Thirsty girl.

279
00:22:26,012 --> 00:22:29,012
[Goku] It seems like someone's
always trying to kill us.

280
00:22:29,112 --> 00:22:33,246
So what else is new? But there's
something different about this
new group of assassins on

281
00:22:33,346 --> 00:22:36,912
our tail. I get the feeling t
hat they're bad news.

282
00:22:37,012 --> 00:22:39,846
Hey, you guys, can
we fight 'em? Okay?

283
00:22:39,979 --> 00:22:44,879
Next time on Saiyuki, we
face "The Mightiest Foe."
