1
00:01:38,327 --> 00:01:41,727
[Goku] We aren't really going to
camp out here, are we?

2
00:01:41,827 --> 00:01:45,327
At least we'll be able to get
out of the rain for a few hours.

3
00:01:45,427 --> 00:01:47,461
[Hakkai] Come on, pull it tight.

4
00:01:47,561 --> 00:01:48,694
[Goku] Damn.

5
00:01:54,861 --> 00:01:58,227
<i>The rain always puts Sanzo</i>
<i>in a bad mood.</i>

6
00:01:58,327 --> 00:02:02,294
<i>I think Hakkai told me why</i>
<i>once, but I've forgotten.</i>

7
00:02:02,394 --> 00:02:05,761
<i>Well, that's got nothing to do</i>
<i>with me anyway.</i>

8
00:02:05,861 --> 00:02:08,594
<i>I don't hate rain that much.</i>

9
00:02:08,694 --> 00:02:11,961
<i>It was my past that always</i>
<i>poured down on me in droves.</i>

10
00:02:13,861 --> 00:02:16,461
<i>I never minded getting</i>
<i>little muddy.</i>

11
00:02:16,561 --> 00:02:20,761
<i>Then again, maybe I convinced</i>
<i>myself the rain could wash</i>
<i>the memories away.</i>

12
00:02:20,861 --> 00:02:23,127
<i>I had been unwilling</i>
<i>to forget.</i>

13
00:02:23,227 --> 00:02:25,161
<i>I use to think like that.</i>

14
00:02:25,261 --> 00:02:28,294
<i>But I'm not the only one here</i>
<i>with scars to heal.</i>

15
00:02:28,394 --> 00:02:31,461
<i>You couldn't severe the bond</i>
<i>between us, even if you tried.</i>

16
00:02:33,261 --> 00:02:37,394
<i>Now that I think about it,</i>
<i>that night three years ago,</i>

17
00:02:37,494 --> 00:02:38,961
<i>it rained like this too.</i>

18
00:02:42,661 --> 00:02:44,527
"The Storm of Fate"

19
00:02:53,727 --> 00:02:56,594
[Gojyo] Aces, four of a kind.

20
00:02:56,694 --> 00:02:59,127
[Girl 1] Yeah!
[Girl 2] You're amazing!

21
00:02:59,227 --> 00:03:02,494
Hey, come on, Gojyo, give me a
break already, will ya?

22
00:03:02,594 --> 00:03:04,861
It's too early to start
complaining, Tongpu.

23
00:03:04,961 --> 00:03:07,494
You still have a few bucks I
haven't won yet.

24
00:03:07,627 --> 00:03:08,594
[Girl 1] That's right.

25
00:03:08,694 --> 00:03:10,261
[Girl 2] The night's
still young.

26
00:03:10,361 --> 00:03:14,194
Tell you what, if I win this
hand here, the next round is
on me, girls.

27
00:03:15,027 --> 00:03:16,594
[All Three] You can do
it, Gojyo!

28
00:03:16,694 --> 00:03:17,861
Wait a minute, is every woman
in this place rooting for
you, Gojyo?

29
00:03:20,194 --> 00:03:22,861
[Girl 4] Of course we are.

30
00:03:22,961 --> 00:03:26,261
You do have the most fantastic
mane of hair.

31
00:03:26,361 --> 00:03:29,261
You must tell me who dyes it?

32
00:03:29,361 --> 00:03:32,827
And you have the most
beautiful eyes too.

33
00:03:32,927 --> 00:03:34,927
[Gojyo] On second thought, let's
call it a night.

34
00:03:35,027 --> 00:03:37,961
[Girl 1] What?
[Gojyo] Bartender, put the
drinks on my tab.

35
00:03:38,061 --> 00:03:40,194
[Girl 2] Gojyo, no wait!

36
00:03:40,327 --> 00:03:41,594
See you later.

37
00:03:41,694 --> 00:03:44,394
[Girl 3] You idiot, he's super
sensitive about his hair.

38
00:03:44,494 --> 00:03:46,661
You can't so much as mention
it around him.

39
00:03:46,761 --> 00:03:48,461
[Girl 4] What?! Why?!

40
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:49,827
[Girl 3] No one knows.

41
00:03:52,894 --> 00:03:56,327
<i>I get through my days living</i>
<i>off my winnings in cards,</i>

42
00:03:56,427 --> 00:04:00,861
<i>and survive the nights by</i>
<i>seducing women with</i>
<i>cheap words.</i>

43
00:04:00,961 --> 00:04:04,094
<i>In a way, living is</i>
<i>disgustingly easy.</i>

44
00:04:06,561 --> 00:04:09,927
<i>That is, so long as I never</i>
<i>have to look anyone in</i>
<i>the eyes.</i>

45
00:04:10,027 --> 00:04:13,761
Pretty hair she says, I don't
know about that.

46
00:04:13,861 --> 00:04:15,561
To me, it looks rather...

47
00:04:29,927 --> 00:04:31,194
What's up with this guy?

48
00:04:34,727 --> 00:04:37,327
[Gojyo] Hello? You dead?

49
00:04:38,861 --> 00:04:40,927
Huh, hey, you're alive!

50
00:04:49,394 --> 00:04:50,794
<i>He looked at me.</i>

51
00:04:53,861 --> 00:04:57,761
<i>And it almost looked as if</i>
<i>he laughed at me too.</i>

52
00:05:01,394 --> 00:05:04,427
Are you saying it was
a mass murder?

53
00:05:04,527 --> 00:05:08,527
[Sanbutsushin A] Yes, two months
ago, the Dark Crow Clan.

54
00:05:08,627 --> 00:05:13,861
Then just a short time ago,
the Hyakugan Maoh's Clan
met the same fate.

55
00:05:13,961 --> 00:05:14,094
A thousand we lost.

56
00:05:16,894 --> 00:05:19,194
[Sanzo] A thousand, you say?

57
00:05:19,294 --> 00:05:21,661
[Sabbutsushin B] Genjo Sanzo...
[Sanzo] Yes.

58
00:05:21,761 --> 00:05:26,794
We call on you to track down
the atrocious criminal who
has done this.

59
00:05:26,894 --> 00:05:30,661
Cho Gonou, a youth who is no
longer human.

60
00:05:32,094 --> 00:05:33,594
Cho Gonou...

61
00:05:48,694 --> 00:05:53,261
If this is Hell, it all looks
rather commonplace.

62
00:05:54,461 --> 00:05:58,161
Well, excuse me for keeping the
place so plain.

63
00:05:58,261 --> 00:06:00,894
You sure took your sweet time
waking up.

64
00:06:00,994 --> 00:06:06,594
Sheesh, the doctor said you
needed to rest and wouldn't
let me smoke around you.

65
00:06:06,694 --> 00:06:10,927
But I'm smoking now! Believe me!
You got that?

66
00:06:11,694 --> 00:06:14,294
Oh, of course, you go ahead.

67
00:06:16,527 --> 00:06:18,161
Aw, forget it.

68
00:06:20,227 --> 00:06:23,761
Tell me, were you the one
ho saved me?

69
00:06:26,661 --> 00:06:29,527
[Gojyo] You know, it too bad.
[Cho] What?

70
00:06:29,627 --> 00:06:32,461
You might have been much better
off if you were in Hell.

71
00:06:34,661 --> 00:06:36,094
[Gojyo] Do you wish you
were dead?

72
00:06:37,961 --> 00:06:40,094
[Tea kettle whistles]

73
00:06:41,727 --> 00:06:46,394
[Cho] No, to be honest, I think
it's better that it turned out
this way.

74
00:06:46,494 --> 00:06:48,961
I'm grateful that you saved me.

75
00:06:49,061 --> 00:06:52,761
You were comatose for about a
week. I stuffed most of your
innards in back myself.

76
00:06:52,861 --> 00:06:54,927
But you should be okay. I hope.

77
00:06:57,194 --> 00:06:59,694
[Gojoy] I wouldn't try any sit
ups for a while if I were you.

78
00:07:01,194 --> 00:07:02,294
Alright.

79
00:07:04,227 --> 00:07:08,661
I'm out of beans I'm afraid,
you'll have to make do
with instant.

80
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:12,194
[Cho] Thank you.
[Gojyo] I also had a doctor
friend of mine take a look
at you.

81
00:07:12,294 --> 00:07:15,661
He said you'll be up to speed
in about a month or two.

82
00:07:15,761 --> 00:07:18,494
So, just make sure and rest
for now.

83
00:07:18,594 --> 00:07:24,461
Oh yeah, for your information,
this is the one and only time
I take a man to bed, you got it?

84
00:07:25,027 --> 00:07:26,161
I do.

85
00:07:29,094 --> 00:07:30,694
[Monk A] Master Sanzo
is here!

86
00:07:30,794 --> 00:07:32,594
[Monk B] Thank the gods.

87
00:07:32,694 --> 00:07:34,861
[Sanzo] What's all the
commotion about?

88
00:07:34,961 --> 00:07:37,027
It's just... that boy.

89
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:39,461
[Goku] Oh, Sanzo!

90
00:07:39,561 --> 00:07:41,661
Welcome back!

91
00:07:41,761 --> 00:07:45,261
He let some filthy stray dog
into the compound.

92
00:07:45,361 --> 00:07:49,527
They've been knocking over altar
articles, it's completely out
of control.

93
00:07:54,194 --> 00:07:55,894
[Goku] Look, Sanzo.

94
00:07:55,994 --> 00:07:57,294
[Sanzo] Why you...

95
00:07:57,927 --> 00:07:58,894
...dumb monkey.

96
00:07:58,994 --> 00:08:00,161
[Goku] That hurt!

97
00:08:00,261 --> 00:08:02,261
What'd you do that for, Sanzo?!

98
00:08:02,361 --> 00:08:03,694
[Sanzo] You know damn well what
I did that for.

99
00:08:03,794 --> 00:08:05,861
That boy is becoming such
a burden.

100
00:08:05,961 --> 00:08:08,694
[Monk A] Why Master would ever
take in such a troublesome child
I will never
[Goku] It looked so hungry!

101
00:08:08,827 --> 00:08:11,327
[Monk A] understand. I just
doesn't make any sense to me.
[Sanzo] Get washed and
changed, now!

102
00:08:11,427 --> 00:08:13,261
[Monk B] I totall agree.
[Goku] I'm going, I'm going!

103
00:08:15,761 --> 00:08:17,861
[Monk A] I'm sorry, Master,
Please forgive us!

104
00:08:19,894 --> 00:08:22,994
<i>Sometimes I wonder why I ever</i>
<i>bothered with him.</i>

105
00:08:23,094 --> 00:08:25,661
<i>It was so damn noisy for</i>
<i>one thing.</i>

106
00:08:25,761 --> 00:08:30,861
His voice kept calling out, it
really grated on my nerves.

107
00:08:30,961 --> 00:08:34,061
When I had enough I went over
to smack him one.

108
00:08:34,161 --> 00:08:38,461
<i>But then he looked up at me</i>
<i>with that stupid look on</i>
<i>his face,</i>

109
00:08:38,561 --> 00:08:40,961
<i>I lost my will to strike.</i>

110
00:08:45,894 --> 00:08:48,161
What's with the piece, you
going somewhere?

111
00:08:48,261 --> 00:08:53,927
Afraid so. Unfortunatly, I've
been given the task of tracking
down a certain someone.

112
00:08:55,394 --> 00:08:56,994
[Goku] Let me go with you!

113
00:08:57,094 --> 00:09:01,127
[Sanzo] I refuse. Why should I
take some troublesome animal
with me?

114
00:09:01,227 --> 00:09:02,794
[Goku] Who're you calling
an animal?!

115
00:09:02,894 --> 00:09:06,161
That'd be you. Don't you know
who you are?

116
00:09:06,261 --> 00:09:10,194
Aw come on, I don't wanna be
left behind here with the monks!

117
00:09:10,294 --> 00:09:14,194
[Monk A] Why Master would ever
take in such a troublesome child
I will never understand.

118
00:09:14,861 --> 00:09:16,561
[Goku] Please, Sanzo!

119
00:09:19,161 --> 00:09:21,961
[Sanzo] You really are a pain
in the ass.

120
00:09:24,994 --> 00:09:27,894
Hurry up, you little monkey.
Let's get moving.

121
00:09:31,627 --> 00:09:33,027
[Goku] Wait up, Sanzo!

122
00:09:34,927 --> 00:09:36,794
[Cho] Full house...

123
00:09:36,894 --> 00:09:38,327
[Gojyo] Not bad at all.

124
00:09:38,427 --> 00:09:41,694
And here I was going easy on
you because you're an invalid.

125
00:09:41,794 --> 00:09:42,827
As far as you know.

126
00:09:42,927 --> 00:09:45,194
Oh, sorry about that.

127
00:09:45,294 --> 00:09:47,227
[Cho] You never ask anything
about me.

128
00:09:48,594 --> 00:09:51,561
You know, I'm not all that
interested, frankly.

129
00:09:51,661 --> 00:09:53,794
[Cho] Since I've already
troubled you so much,

130
00:09:53,894 --> 00:09:58,161
would you mind terribly if
I stayed until I'm able
to get around?

131
00:09:58,261 --> 00:10:00,161
Got anywhere to go?

132
00:10:00,261 --> 00:10:04,994
No, but I do have one piece of
unfinished business.

133
00:10:05,094 --> 00:10:07,994
How about that? Now I have the
full house this time!

134
00:10:08,094 --> 00:10:11,294
Oh, I'm sorry, but I happen to
have a straight flush.

135
00:10:11,394 --> 00:10:17,161
Okay, what's the deal? I do
his for a living, you know.
Are you a professional?

136
00:10:17,261 --> 00:10:20,227
For some reason these things
just come easily to me.

137
00:10:21,727 --> 00:10:24,461
But even if I can read the flow
of the game,

138
00:10:24,561 --> 00:10:27,294
I still need a lot of luck on my
side to win.

139
00:10:28,361 --> 00:10:30,427
Guess I'm not making much sense.

140
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:33,361
[Gojyo] You're one of those
clever poor guy types,
aren't you?

141
00:10:33,461 --> 00:10:34,627
[Cho] I guess I am.

142
00:10:35,894 --> 00:10:37,061
I am too.

143
00:10:52,622 --> 00:10:57,722
Sanzo, I'm thinking if this
Cho Gonou guy killed a
thousand demons,

144
00:10:57,855 --> 00:11:03,155
and became a demon himself, he's
a real bad dude, right?

145
00:11:03,255 --> 00:11:05,155
[Sanzo] Who can say?

146
00:11:05,255 --> 00:11:08,455
<i>Something about this mission</i>
<i>just doesn't seem right.</i>

147
00:11:08,555 --> 00:11:12,288
<i>I know nothing about this man</i>
<i>beyond a physical description.</i>

148
00:11:12,388 --> 00:11:17,322
<i>Why did the Sanbutsushin send</i>
<i>me to pursue an ordinary</i>
<i>demon murderer?</i>

149
00:11:18,488 --> 00:11:20,355
[Woman A] Something's wrong with
Gojyo.

150
00:11:20,455 --> 00:11:24,622
[Woman B] You're telling me,
he didn't try to hit on me
once yesterday.

151
00:11:24,722 --> 00:11:28,522
[Man A] Didn't he say something
about taking in some wounded
guy about a month ago?

152
00:11:28,622 --> 00:11:32,788
Someone with green eyes and
pretty face, that's when
it started.

153
00:11:35,288 --> 00:11:36,922
Sanzo?

154
00:11:37,022 --> 00:11:41,155
I'd like to more about this
wounded man your friend has
taken in.

155
00:11:41,255 --> 00:11:43,355
Why look for a wounded man at my
friends house,

156
00:11:43,455 --> 00:11:46,555
when there's a perfectly
healthy, totally hot number
right here?

157
00:11:46,655 --> 00:11:49,855
I'll be you all carry big guns
in your robes.

158
00:11:51,588 --> 00:11:54,755
The sterotype happens
to be true.

159
00:11:56,688 --> 00:11:58,822
Do you happen to have a moment?

160
00:11:58,922 --> 00:12:01,055
Sure, are you leaving?

161
00:12:01,155 --> 00:12:02,822
I am.

162
00:12:02,922 --> 00:12:06,388
But there is something I want
to tell you before I go.

163
00:12:06,522 --> 00:12:13,022
I've killed so many with the
blade of my ego, and I murdered
everyone of them in the name
of revenge.

164
00:12:13,122 --> 00:12:18,188
I have one thing left to do then
I intend to accept whatever
punishment I have coming.

165
00:12:18,288 --> 00:12:21,988
I am truly grateful to you for
saving my life that night.

166
00:12:26,188 --> 00:12:28,155
Perhaps this is my act
of penitence.

167
00:12:28,255 --> 00:12:29,788
Penitence?

168
00:12:29,888 --> 00:12:33,555
The color of your hair and eyes
remind me of...

169
00:12:33,655 --> 00:12:36,355
...the color of the blood that
I have spilled.

170
00:12:40,388 --> 00:12:44,588
[Cho] The crimson that stains my
hands is what keeps me grounded
in reality,

171
00:12:44,688 --> 00:12:48,922
even as I attampt to escape the
weight of my sins.

172
00:12:49,022 --> 00:12:54,255
Your hair and your eyes are
the only things that admonish
me, Gojyo.

173
00:13:00,022 --> 00:13:01,088
I see.

174
00:13:01,188 --> 00:13:03,088
[Cho] Well, I'll be going now.

175
00:13:04,555 --> 00:13:06,988
[Gojoy] Sure...

176
00:13:07,088 --> 00:13:09,388
<i>[Gojyo] Maybe what I wanted was</i>
<i>someone who could only</i>
<i>see blood</i>

177
00:13:09,488 --> 00:13:12,288
<i>in this crimson color,</i>
<i>just like I do.</i>

178
00:13:14,555 --> 00:13:16,222
[Gojyo] Say...

179
00:13:17,455 --> 00:13:19,655
I still don't know your name.

180
00:13:20,655 --> 00:13:22,588
My name is-
[knock at the door]

181
00:13:23,988 --> 00:13:25,088
Hold on a sec.

182
00:13:27,255 --> 00:13:28,922
[Gojyo] Yeah, yeah, who is it?

183
00:13:31,322 --> 00:13:33,122
[Sanzo] Sorry to disturb you
so late,

184
00:13:33,222 --> 00:13:36,155
but I'm on a hunt for a
diabolical criminal,

185
00:13:36,255 --> 00:13:38,122
who has commited mass murder.

186
00:13:39,422 --> 00:13:42,822
[Sanzo] A young man in his
twenties with green eyes.

187
00:13:42,922 --> 00:13:45,188
He goes by the name
of Cho Gonou.

188
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:49,288
Really? Don't know him.

189
00:13:49,388 --> 00:13:54,722
Don't play dumb. I know for a
fact that you took this mad
man into your own home.

190
00:13:54,822 --> 00:13:57,155
[Gojyo] And I'm telling you I've
never heard of him.

191
00:13:57,255 --> 00:13:58,655
Who the hell are you anyway?

192
00:13:58,755 --> 00:14:01,188
What kind of a monk goes around
hunting murderers?

193
00:14:06,522 --> 00:14:08,088
Let me go.

194
00:14:08,188 --> 00:14:09,988
[Gojyo] What if I say no?

195
00:14:15,622 --> 00:14:16,855
[Gojyo] Bastard!

196
00:14:23,288 --> 00:14:26,922
You'll pay for that.
You're a dead man.

197
00:14:27,022 --> 00:14:29,955
What denomination did you say
you were, Buddah?

198
00:14:30,055 --> 00:14:32,922
The kind that doesn't forbid my
kicking your ass.

199
00:14:33,022 --> 00:14:37,388
Just because you belong to an
order, doesn't mean I have to
follow yours.

200
00:14:37,488 --> 00:14:40,255
You want to die that
badly, do ya?

201
00:14:40,355 --> 00:14:42,088
I don't die easily.

202
00:14:43,188 --> 00:14:44,322
[Gunshot]

203
00:14:46,322 --> 00:14:48,555
You damn Buddah thumper.

204
00:14:48,655 --> 00:14:53,222
Now I don't want to have
to bloody up those luscious
locks of yours, pretty boy.

205
00:14:53,322 --> 00:14:54,788
Stop it, Gojyo!

206
00:14:54,888 --> 00:14:57,022
You stay inside now!

207
00:14:57,122 --> 00:14:58,288
So you're Cho Gonou?

208
00:15:06,255 --> 00:15:07,388
[Sanzo] You bastard...

209
00:15:07,488 --> 00:15:10,522
I always did do better when
I'm on top.

210
00:15:10,622 --> 00:15:11,788
[Gojyo] Hurry up and run!

211
00:15:13,455 --> 00:15:14,855
I said go!

212
00:15:16,455 --> 00:15:17,588
Goku!

213
00:15:19,055 --> 00:15:21,022
[Gojyo] So you brought a
friend with you?

214
00:15:23,388 --> 00:15:26,155
I just have to beat this guy,
am I right?

215
00:15:26,255 --> 00:15:27,388
Damn...

216
00:15:37,855 --> 00:15:40,288
<i>He actually managed to block</i>
<i>Goku's attack!</i>

217
00:15:44,088 --> 00:15:48,555
Sanzo, this guy might actually
be pretty good!

218
00:15:48,655 --> 00:15:50,655
[Sanzo] Don't act so happy!

219
00:15:50,755 --> 00:15:52,788
Then I'll take it seriously now!

220
00:15:59,088 --> 00:16:01,522
<i>What is that brat on?</i>
<i>He's fast!</i>

221
00:16:08,222 --> 00:16:09,655
No fair.

222
00:16:09,755 --> 00:16:10,288
[Sanzo] Goku!

223
00:16:10,388 --> 00:16:11,255
Please don't move,

224
00:16:11,355 --> 00:16:12,988
and just listen to me.

225
00:16:14,655 --> 00:16:19,388
[Cho] Don't blame him for any
of this. He has nothing to
do with me.

226
00:16:20,555 --> 00:16:24,088
It's true that I have committed
henious sins.

227
00:16:24,188 --> 00:16:26,722
But there is just one thing
I have left to do.

228
00:16:28,555 --> 00:16:30,088
Time...

229
00:16:30,188 --> 00:16:32,888
I just need to have a little
more time.

230
00:16:34,155 --> 00:16:36,655
I apologize for everything.

231
00:16:38,188 --> 00:16:39,322
[Goku] Hey!

232
00:16:42,588 --> 00:16:46,988
<i>[Cho] In all honesty, I've</i>
<i>desired to be condemned</i>
<i>to Hell,</i>

233
00:16:47,088 --> 00:16:49,788
<i>ever since I lost what was</i>
<i>precious to me.</i>

234
00:16:51,755 --> 00:16:52,822
Which is?

235
00:16:52,922 --> 00:16:54,622
To me, she was my true love,

236
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:57,588
but in someways was also
like my older sister.

237
00:16:57,688 --> 00:17:00,088
She gently embraced everything.

238
00:17:00,188 --> 00:17:03,555
I did love the way she was so
open to the world.

239
00:17:03,655 --> 00:17:06,555
I made a promise that I would
always protect her,

240
00:17:06,655 --> 00:17:09,955
that I would always be with her
no matter what happened.

241
00:17:10,055 --> 00:17:14,122
But... You know how people
often talk about premonitions?

242
00:17:14,222 --> 00:17:20,155
Well, when all those terrible
things were happening to her,
I was completely oblivious.

243
00:17:20,255 --> 00:17:23,455
It was just another day working
with my students.

244
00:17:23,555 --> 00:17:27,022
I couldn't sense it.
Why couldn't I know
what was happening,

245
00:17:27,122 --> 00:17:30,188
and run to protect her when she
needed me the most?

246
00:17:31,188 --> 00:17:34,588
[Gojyo] That's the way life
is, isn't it?

247
00:17:34,688 --> 00:17:38,122
It doesn't mean you didn't love
her, so don't blame yourself.

248
00:17:38,222 --> 00:17:39,955
No that I'm in a position
to say.

249
00:17:41,888 --> 00:17:45,355
I don't have anything that's
precious to me, so I
wouldn't know.

250
00:17:45,455 --> 00:17:47,088
What the heck is love anyway?

251
00:17:47,188 --> 00:17:48,322
Not that I want it.

252
00:17:52,455 --> 00:17:55,022
<i>[Gojyo] I let my hair grow out</i>
<i>as a lesson to myself,</i>

253
00:17:55,122 --> 00:17:59,522
<i>and to hide the scars from when</i>
<i>my mother almost killed me.</i>

254
00:18:01,388 --> 00:18:04,488
<i>The color of blood that's</i>
<i>like admonishment...</i>

255
00:18:04,588 --> 00:18:06,888
<i>I thought I was the only one</i>
<i>who saw it that way.</i>

256
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:11,722
<i>So it appears that love was the</i>
<i>source of both our pain.</i>

257
00:18:11,855 --> 00:18:16,022
<i>The love that I couldn't</i>
<i>win, the love that he</i>
<i>couldn't protect.</i>

258
00:18:16,122 --> 00:18:20,188
<i>That night as we both</i>
<i>blamed ourselves for</i>
<i>being so powerless,</i>

259
00:18:20,288 --> 00:18:23,722
<i>the phantoms of our memories</i>
<i>vanished in a sea of blood.</i>

260
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:31,584
So he's called Cho Gonou?

261
00:18:31,684 --> 00:18:33,750
That name really doesn't
fit him.

262
00:18:33,850 --> 00:18:36,617
And you're telling me he never
told you anything?

263
00:18:36,717 --> 00:18:38,484
[Gojyo] That's what I've been
saying all along.

264
00:18:38,584 --> 00:18:40,850
I don't know why you haven't
been listening to me.

265
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:45,050
And another thing, I don't
see why I'm responcible
for feeding your pet.

266
00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:46,784
You're pushing your luck.

267
00:18:46,884 --> 00:18:51,084
Hey, this is really good!
Can I finish it? Can I?

268
00:18:51,184 --> 00:18:54,384
You trying to eat me out
of house and home, you
stupid monkey?!

269
00:18:54,484 --> 00:18:57,817
I'm not a monkey! My name's
Goku, you deginerate!

270
00:18:57,917 --> 00:19:00,817
Well I think stupid monkey is
the most accurate.

271
00:19:00,917 --> 00:19:04,117
Well, he did go without eating
for about five hundred years.

272
00:19:04,217 --> 00:19:06,784
So his body must be trying to
make up for it.

273
00:19:06,884 --> 00:19:08,650
[Gojyo] What's up with that?

274
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:10,950
You certainly are eccentric.

275
00:19:11,050 --> 00:19:14,484
Why did you take him in if you
knew it would cause problems
for you?

276
00:19:15,884 --> 00:19:19,284
[Gojyo] Good question. I'm not
sure I know the answer.

277
00:19:19,384 --> 00:19:22,717
[Goku] Hey, Sanzo, is he really
a bad guy?

278
00:19:22,817 --> 00:19:24,017
Why do you ask?

279
00:19:24,117 --> 00:19:28,184
For some reason he just didn't
seem like a bad guy to me.

280
00:19:28,284 --> 00:19:30,884
Murder doesn't necessarily
mean evil, right?

281
00:19:30,984 --> 00:19:35,517
The world being what it is a lot
of people out there deserve to
die, don't they?

282
00:19:35,617 --> 00:19:42,217
But those who do take it apon
themselves to kill others have
to be prepared to have others
try to kill them as well.

283
00:19:42,317 --> 00:19:46,417
And that's what they call the
law of karma, my friends.

284
00:19:46,517 --> 00:19:50,117
That's why, good or bad, the
ones who are going to be
left standing

285
00:19:50,217 --> 00:19:53,184
are those with the strongest
wills to survive.

286
00:19:59,350 --> 00:20:01,717
Will to live, huh? Too bad
you're a monk.

287
00:20:01,817 --> 00:20:03,584
And what is that supposed
to mean?

288
00:20:03,684 --> 00:20:07,384
So where does that leave us?

289
00:20:07,484 --> 00:20:09,084
What are we going to do now?
Do we just let him go?

290
00:20:09,184 --> 00:20:12,817
Listen, I may not like it,
but this is still my
assigned mission.

291
00:20:12,917 --> 00:20:15,117
Even if it is a pain in the ass.

292
00:20:15,217 --> 00:20:17,017
[Gojyo] I'm afraid you're
wasting your time.

293
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:21,584
I don't know what kind of
unfinished business he has,

294
00:20:21,684 --> 00:20:25,184
but whatever it is,
he's gonna do it.

295
00:20:25,284 --> 00:20:28,484
And then he'll probably die.

296
00:20:28,617 --> 00:20:30,617
That's just the kind of guy
he is.

297
00:20:30,717 --> 00:20:35,450
[Sanzo] If that's true, that's
even more reason for me to
find him.

298
00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:40,817
My instructions are to capture
Cho Gonou and bring him to the
Palace of the Setting Sun alive.

299
00:20:40,917 --> 00:20:44,017
I can't have him dying at his
own convenience!

300
00:20:44,117 --> 00:20:46,584
Sorry to bother you.

301
00:20:46,684 --> 00:20:48,017
Hey...

302
00:20:49,184 --> 00:20:50,317
Count me in.

303
00:22:29,217 --> 00:22:32,784
[Sanzo] As the rain continues,
it washes away everything.

304
00:22:32,884 --> 00:22:36,384
The sorrows, the pain,
the regrets.

305
00:22:36,484 --> 00:22:38,250
Yes, even the sins.

306
00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:41,950
As the crimson of blood turns
into the crimson of sunrise.

307
00:22:42,084 --> 00:22:47,584
There is a new dawn of hope,
a ray of light that only
the living can see.

308
00:22:47,684 --> 00:22:51,384
