1
00:01:37,874 --> 00:01:40,103
Wait! Don't do it, Kougaiji.

2
00:01:40,103 --> 00:01:41,503
Out of my way!

3
00:01:43,836 --> 00:01:45,336
Kou, stop!

4
00:01:47,336 --> 00:01:48,869
Lord Kougaiji...

5
00:01:51,269 --> 00:01:54,603
I never thought the day would
come when I would use this.

6
00:01:55,269 --> 00:01:56,036
Then don't.

7
00:01:56,136 --> 00:01:57,469
Are you sure it's...

8
00:01:57,569 --> 00:01:59,303
it's wise?

9
00:01:59,403 --> 00:02:03,503
I know. It's been locked
away for such a long time.

10
00:02:03,603 --> 00:02:05,936
<i>But without a fiend</i>
<i>this strong...</i>

11
00:02:06,036 --> 00:02:11,436
<i>There's no way I'll</i>
<i>ever be able to defeat</i>
<i>those... those gods.</i>

12
00:02:11,536 --> 00:02:16,403
But Kou, that fiend has
been sealed up tight for
several hundreds of years.

13
00:02:16,503 --> 00:02:19,036
You know how many demonic
sacrifices you'd have to

14
00:02:19,136 --> 00:02:22,536
make for it to reach its
full and powerful potential?

15
00:02:22,636 --> 00:02:24,803
[Kougaiji] That's been
taken care of.

16
00:02:24,903 --> 00:02:27,103
You have sacrifices?

17
00:02:27,203 --> 00:02:28,136
[Kougaiji] Yes.

18
00:02:28,236 --> 00:02:30,936
There were many who volunteered.

19
00:02:31,036 --> 00:02:33,069
This isn't like you, Kou.

20
00:02:33,169 --> 00:02:35,336
You realize what
you're purposing?

21
00:02:35,436 --> 00:02:39,369
Are you sure Homura's defeat is
worth the lives of thousands?

22
00:02:39,469 --> 00:02:45,469
I am. If I don't defeat him,
and revive Gyumaoh, then...

23
00:02:45,569 --> 00:02:48,836
I see. Well, if you're
that determined,

24
00:02:48,936 --> 00:02:51,736
then I'll say no more
about it, I promise.

25
00:02:53,236 --> 00:02:55,069
<i>[Kougaiji] I have no choice.</i>

26
00:02:56,603 --> 00:02:58,636
<i>This is the only way.</i>

27
00:03:05,103 --> 00:03:07,869
[Goku] "Struggle in solitude."

28
00:03:26,036 --> 00:03:29,336
I don't know. This doesn't
look good, if you ask me.

29
00:03:30,069 --> 00:03:31,803
Is this the only way?

30
00:03:31,903 --> 00:03:33,603
I'm afraid so.

31
00:03:33,703 --> 00:03:35,803
It's been raining cats
and dogs for days.

32
00:03:35,903 --> 00:03:39,103
With our luck, it's probably
flooded the entire river.

33
00:03:39,203 --> 00:03:41,003
[Goku] What're we gonna do?
[Goku's stomach growls]

34
00:03:41,103 --> 00:03:42,803
I haven't even had lunch yet.

35
00:03:43,603 --> 00:03:44,969
Damn.

36
00:03:45,069 --> 00:03:47,336
[Kids] Kouryuu, the river rat!

37
00:03:47,436 --> 00:03:49,736
Kouryuu, the river rat!

38
00:03:49,836 --> 00:03:52,336
Kouryuu, the river rat!

39
00:03:57,269 --> 00:03:59,669
Well then. Let's go
look for an inn.

40
00:03:59,769 --> 00:04:01,703
[Goku] Yeah!
[Hakkai] I'm with you. The four

41
00:04:01,803 --> 00:04:05,603
of us can't continue our
little journey west without
crossing that river.

42
00:04:07,003 --> 00:04:09,636
[Sanzo] Let's go.
[Hakkai] But...

43
00:04:09,736 --> 00:04:14,069
There's bound to be another road
with another bridge upstream.

44
00:04:14,203 --> 00:04:15,336
Find it.

45
00:04:15,436 --> 00:04:18,136
Yeah, but Sanzo, we could
travel miles out of our

46
00:04:18,236 --> 00:04:20,203
way just to find any bridge.

47
00:04:20,303 --> 00:04:22,403
If we wait for the river to go
down...

48
00:04:22,503 --> 00:04:25,603
[Sanzo] Then wait.
I'll cross alone.

49
00:04:30,769 --> 00:04:32,003
What the hell.

50
00:04:32,103 --> 00:04:34,936
We might as well just humor
him a little while, you guys.

51
00:04:36,636 --> 00:04:38,136
I guess.

52
00:04:42,003 --> 00:04:45,103
<i>Damn it for making me</i>
<i>remember stupid things.</i>

53
00:04:51,703 --> 00:04:56,169
[Zenon] Hey, Shien.
What happened to Homura?

54
00:04:56,269 --> 00:04:58,503
He's off doing his usual errand.

55
00:04:59,569 --> 00:05:00,836
[Zenon] Usual?

56
00:05:00,936 --> 00:05:02,869
Oh, of course.

57
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:06,803
He still hasn't found
that stupid grave of
hers yet, has he?

58
00:05:06,903 --> 00:05:08,503
Sure is taking a while.

59
00:05:08,603 --> 00:05:11,769
That's true. It is.

60
00:05:11,869 --> 00:05:15,369
But he did tell me he had
a promising lead on it.

61
00:05:15,469 --> 00:05:19,403
Is that so? Searching around
for this grave is taking a

62
00:05:19,503 --> 00:05:23,303
hell of a lot longer than
any of us anticipated.

63
00:05:23,403 --> 00:05:24,636
[Shien] That is true.

64
00:05:24,736 --> 00:05:27,503
I think it's time
this party moves on.

65
00:05:27,603 --> 00:05:30,336
It's not like Rinrei's
coming back or anything.

66
00:05:30,436 --> 00:05:31,369
[Shien chuckles]

67
00:05:31,469 --> 00:05:34,436
I don't think you can
complain about it.

68
00:05:34,536 --> 00:05:36,703
[Zenon] No?
[Shien] I believe you were the

69
00:05:36,803 --> 00:05:38,536
one who dragged your feet...

70
00:05:38,636 --> 00:05:41,803
on the whole issue of
Mirei, were you not?

71
00:05:41,903 --> 00:05:43,769
That may be...

72
00:05:43,869 --> 00:05:45,703
But I still don't like it.

73
00:05:52,069 --> 00:05:53,336
Here it is.

74
00:05:54,703 --> 00:05:56,669
It looks like this is the place.

75
00:05:57,669 --> 00:05:58,803
Finally.

76
00:06:03,003 --> 00:06:06,036
There's not even a
trace of her left here.

77
00:06:19,836 --> 00:06:20,636
Rinrei...

78
00:06:20,736 --> 00:06:21,903
<i>[Rinrei] I wish...</i>

79
00:06:24,003 --> 00:06:26,969
I wish it could stay like
this forever, my darling.

80
00:06:28,436 --> 00:06:33,303
Rinrei, I'm here with
you. I'll never leave.

81
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:37,069
[Rinrei] Aren't the
flowers beautiful?

82
00:06:37,169 --> 00:06:38,969
[Homura] Yes, they are.

83
00:06:40,303 --> 00:06:42,569
I'm still... a little girl.

84
00:06:43,769 --> 00:06:45,736
Grasping at fairy tales.

85
00:06:48,436 --> 00:06:52,336
I know it... can never
last between us.

86
00:06:52,436 --> 00:06:55,036
But I still cling to some hope.

87
00:06:55,136 --> 00:06:56,903
<i>[Homura] What would I wish for?</i>

88
00:06:57,003 --> 00:07:00,536
<i>In this... city of</i>
<i>perpetual darkness,</i>

89
00:07:00,636 --> 00:07:02,903
<i>where tomorrow never comes.</i>

90
00:07:03,003 --> 00:07:06,203
<i>Here, I alone grow old.</i>

91
00:07:06,303 --> 00:07:11,503
<i>And Rinrei, the girl I</i>
<i>was forbidden to love,</i>
<i>would live forever.</i>

92
00:07:11,603 --> 00:07:16,636
<i>I could never tell her how,</i>
<i>secretly, I resented her</i>
<i>unchanging existance.</i>

93
00:07:19,969 --> 00:07:23,069
[Emperor] Homura, have you
fallen in love with this woman?

94
00:07:23,169 --> 00:07:26,169
No, sir! On what basis do
you make such an allegat-

95
00:07:26,269 --> 00:07:29,669
Silence! I will not
stand for your lies!

96
00:07:30,936 --> 00:07:33,803
You are a troublesome young man.

97
00:07:33,903 --> 00:07:37,036
You're not content
merely being a heresy,

98
00:07:37,136 --> 00:07:40,636
born of an immortal and human.

99
00:07:40,736 --> 00:07:43,836
You must commit this
crime as well.

100
00:07:43,936 --> 00:07:46,136
My mother...

101
00:07:46,236 --> 00:07:49,969
I wonder what has happened to my
mother since she committed the

102
00:07:50,069 --> 00:07:54,469
sacreligious obscenity that gave
birth to an abomination like me.

103
00:07:55,803 --> 00:07:59,836
I have decided to
reincarnate Rinrei.

104
00:07:59,936 --> 00:08:01,936
What for?

105
00:08:02,036 --> 00:08:05,969
Your beloved Rinrei is
a pureblood immortal.

106
00:08:06,069 --> 00:08:11,036
And that power means she
can still be reincarnated
into the Lower World.

107
00:08:11,136 --> 00:08:17,736
And it is there she will live a
short life, as punishment for
her blasphemy.

108
00:08:17,836 --> 00:08:20,836
What for?! It wasn't
her, it was me!

109
00:08:20,936 --> 00:08:23,769
I should be the one to
recieve any punishment!

110
00:08:23,869 --> 00:08:28,703
As for you, the post of War
Prince has been left vacant.

111
00:08:29,736 --> 00:08:31,369
[Homura] You don't mean...

112
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:36,903
You are my choice for the spot
left open by Prince Nataku.

113
00:08:37,003 --> 00:08:39,369
You are the War Prince Homura!

114
00:08:49,925 --> 00:08:54,624
<i>[Homura] It wasn't long before</i>
<i>I discovered the hypocrisies...</i>

115
00:08:54,624 --> 00:08:59,991
<i>Of a heaven concerned only</i>
<i>with its own self interests.</i>

116
00:09:00,091 --> 00:09:05,991
<i>Where gods lived on the</i>
<i>sweat of beings forced</i>
<i>to do their dirty work.</i>

117
00:09:06,091 --> 00:09:09,391
<i>By the time I discovered I was</i>
<i>merely their pawn...</i>

118
00:09:11,291 --> 00:09:12,824
<i>it was too late.</i>

119
00:09:15,358 --> 00:09:19,758
[Homura] I'm sorry, Rinrei.
I could not hear your cries.

120
00:09:20,491 --> 00:09:23,458
But I promise you, soon...

121
00:09:23,558 --> 00:09:25,891
Everyone will see
the ugliness...

122
00:09:25,991 --> 00:09:30,891
festering beneath the marble
floors... of paradise.

123
00:09:40,524 --> 00:09:43,191
[Homura] Let me guess.
The demon woman sent you?

124
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:44,258
[Demon 1] No!

125
00:09:44,358 --> 00:09:46,491
[Demon 2] We serve
Lord Kougaiji!

126
00:09:46,591 --> 00:09:48,458
Well, fine. Whatever.

127
00:09:48,558 --> 00:09:52,091
Now go. I'm in no mood
to kill you today.

128
00:09:52,191 --> 00:09:53,724
Then let me help you!

129
00:10:02,791 --> 00:10:04,191
Do you see what I mean now?

130
00:10:04,291 --> 00:10:06,558
I have other things on
my mind at the moment,

131
00:10:06,658 --> 00:10:08,091
so don't make me mad.

132
00:10:08,191 --> 00:10:11,191
[Kougaiji] Well, I had no idea
you were such a gentleman.

133
00:10:15,924 --> 00:10:17,391
[Homura] Kougaiji?

134
00:10:17,491 --> 00:10:20,991
You know, I do not particularly
dislike you, my friend.

135
00:10:21,091 --> 00:10:23,358
So please don't
make me kill you.

136
00:10:23,458 --> 00:10:26,424
I'm afraid you caught
me on a bad day.

137
00:10:26,524 --> 00:10:29,124
Why don't you try
me some other time?

138
00:10:29,224 --> 00:10:30,891
I'm in a little bit of a hurry.

139
00:10:35,158 --> 00:10:37,424
[Homura] Do you
absolutely insist?

140
00:10:37,524 --> 00:10:39,691
That's right! I do!

141
00:10:39,791 --> 00:10:41,491
If that's what you want,

142
00:10:41,591 --> 00:10:44,291
then you will not live to
rue this day, Kougaiji!

143
00:10:47,091 --> 00:10:48,524
[Kougaiji] That's my line!

144
00:10:48,624 --> 00:10:51,291
Your bad day just got worse!

145
00:10:51,391 --> 00:10:54,391
Rise, rise, dragon of light,
consume the life force of

146
00:10:54,491 --> 00:10:57,524
those who give their lives for
your cause. Fiend of lightning,

147
00:10:57,658 --> 00:11:00,724
wings of flame, breath
of thunder, rise, rise!

148
00:11:00,824 --> 00:11:02,824
Lightning dragon, attack!

149
00:11:16,224 --> 00:11:18,858
[Demons scream]

150
00:11:20,324 --> 00:11:23,624
Are you absolutely certain
that you want to do this?

151
00:11:25,191 --> 00:11:26,658
Lightning dragon!

152
00:11:30,791 --> 00:11:33,124
And now, you will suffer.

153
00:11:33,224 --> 00:11:35,791
Suffer for what you did to me!

154
00:11:35,891 --> 00:11:38,991
[Goku] What... kind of...
road is this, Hakkai?!

155
00:11:39,091 --> 00:11:42,458
Don't... talk, Goku. Or you're
gonna... bite your tongue.

156
00:11:42,558 --> 00:11:46,624
I swear, the things we do
because someone is a spoiled
rotten, whiny brat.

157
00:11:46,724 --> 00:11:49,258
Don't blame me!
This was your idea!

158
00:11:49,358 --> 00:11:54,124
Why you little...! It wasn't
me! It was Sanzo! Sanzo-ouch!

159
00:11:54,224 --> 00:11:55,691
I bit my tongue.

160
00:11:55,791 --> 00:11:57,424
What? You're kidding.

161
00:11:58,391 --> 00:12:00,624
Ow! I bit my tongue!

162
00:12:00,724 --> 00:12:04,858
<i>[Hakkai] Good grief,</i>
<i>why doesn't anyone</i>
<i>ever listen to me?</i>

163
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:07,591
[Goku] Sanzo, I bit my tongue!

164
00:12:07,691 --> 00:12:11,224
How 'bout... I make
you bite it off?

165
00:12:11,324 --> 00:12:14,191
[Goku] But how will
I taste my food then?

166
00:12:14,291 --> 00:12:16,424
[Sanzo] You'll be tasting
lead pretty soon!

167
00:12:21,258 --> 00:12:23,124
Ready, War Prince?

168
00:12:23,224 --> 00:12:26,958
As you wish. I'll face
your dragon with a dragon.

169
00:12:31,891 --> 00:12:34,291
Go, Lightning dragon!

170
00:12:44,291 --> 00:12:46,258
[Kougaiji laughs]

171
00:12:46,358 --> 00:12:49,424
[Kougaiji] You tried that
little trick on me once before.

172
00:13:05,491 --> 00:13:09,158
The Lightning dragon is not
a common fiend like yours.

173
00:13:09,258 --> 00:13:14,024
It's merges with its
summoner to form a single,
unstoppable beast!

174
00:13:18,224 --> 00:13:20,691
You said it yourself, Homura.

175
00:13:20,791 --> 00:13:25,824
There is no such thing as good
or evil! There is only power!

176
00:13:27,624 --> 00:13:29,124
Exactly.

177
00:13:29,224 --> 00:13:32,691
That is why only those with
power shall control the world.

178
00:13:32,791 --> 00:13:36,591
Then I guess that means
I control the world!

179
00:13:36,691 --> 00:13:37,824
[Homura] Afraid not.

180
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:40,924
The power you have there...

181
00:13:41,024 --> 00:13:42,824
has been given to you.

182
00:13:44,424 --> 00:13:49,391
Anyone who has to borrow
their power from others
is not worth my time.

183
00:13:49,491 --> 00:13:55,024
Shut up! The one thing
that matters is that
I will destroy you!

184
00:13:55,124 --> 00:14:00,324
Don't lose sight of yourself for
such a small thing, Kougaiji.

185
00:14:07,591 --> 00:14:09,358
What the-?!

186
00:14:09,458 --> 00:14:10,591
[Homura] Behind you.

187
00:14:12,191 --> 00:14:13,624
[Homura] Stop this foolishness!

188
00:14:13,724 --> 00:14:15,691
<i>[Kougaiji] What? I didn't...</i>

189
00:14:15,791 --> 00:14:19,258
[Homura] I don't wish to
fight you until you are ready.

190
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:20,958
[Kougaiji] Are you
running away?!

191
00:14:21,058 --> 00:14:22,124
[Tires screeching]

192
00:14:22,224 --> 00:14:24,358
[Sanzo party yelling]

193
00:14:27,791 --> 00:14:31,791
The good news is I finally
found a smoother road
to drive on.

194
00:14:31,891 --> 00:14:35,658
[Goyjo] And landed right
in the middle of another
rocky predicament.

195
00:14:35,758 --> 00:14:38,624
[Homura] Well...
[All] Hm?

196
00:14:38,724 --> 00:14:40,358
Glad you could drop in.

197
00:14:40,458 --> 00:14:41,958
Stop the pleasantries.

198
00:14:42,058 --> 00:14:44,191
It's not like this was
planned or anything.

199
00:14:44,291 --> 00:14:45,291
[Homura] Son Goku.

200
00:14:45,391 --> 00:14:46,791
What is it?

201
00:14:47,424 --> 00:14:48,858
Put your hands up.

202
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:51,091
[Goku] Huh? Like this?

203
00:14:53,524 --> 00:14:55,458
Wha-what was that for?

204
00:14:55,558 --> 00:14:57,524
[Homura] Now it's your turn.

205
00:14:57,624 --> 00:14:58,958
Listen, Homura.

206
00:14:59,991 --> 00:15:03,224
That was pretty cheap.
Even for a god.

207
00:15:03,324 --> 00:15:06,258
Heh. Even I have
my limits, priest.

208
00:15:06,358 --> 00:15:11,058
And who knows? You and your
little band of heroes might
even be able to save him.

209
00:15:11,158 --> 00:15:13,058
[Kougaiji] Damn. Come back here!

210
00:15:13,158 --> 00:15:14,658
[Goku] Wow!

211
00:15:14,758 --> 00:15:16,091
He packs a punch!

212
00:15:19,424 --> 00:15:21,858
Where's Homura? Did he kill him?

213
00:15:21,958 --> 00:15:26,624
I doubt it. I'm going to
assume you can't get rid
of a god that easy.

214
00:15:26,724 --> 00:15:30,324
Then that crazy jerk
god did run away.

215
00:15:33,391 --> 00:15:35,024
So that's it.

216
00:15:40,858 --> 00:15:43,658
Okay... What's wrong with him?

217
00:15:47,824 --> 00:15:49,458
Hey, Kougaiji?!

218
00:15:55,691 --> 00:15:58,758
Oh boy. He got himself in
a real mess this time.

219
00:15:58,858 --> 00:16:01,691
If you ask me,
it would appear...

220
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:04,991
that our friend has
taken extreme measures
to deal with Homura.

221
00:16:05,091 --> 00:16:07,458
What's the plan, huh? Sanzo!

222
00:16:13,324 --> 00:16:15,224
Guess we just have to fight him!

223
00:16:16,791 --> 00:16:17,924
What?!

224
00:16:24,391 --> 00:16:25,524
Extend!

225
00:16:28,091 --> 00:16:31,424
Stop it! Kougaiji, you
didn't need to do this!

226
00:16:31,558 --> 00:16:34,991
You were strong enough before,
even when you weren't like this!

227
00:16:39,624 --> 00:16:40,758
Why?!

228
00:16:42,024 --> 00:16:43,324
<i>[Kougaiji] Why?</i>

229
00:16:43,424 --> 00:16:46,191
<i>Why did I become like this?</i>

230
00:16:46,291 --> 00:16:47,424
<i>What was it all for?</i>

231
00:16:47,524 --> 00:16:51,458
<i>To fight Goku?</i>
<i>To defeat Homura?</i>

232
00:16:51,558 --> 00:16:53,391
<i>No, that's not it either.</i>

233
00:16:54,191 --> 00:16:55,624
<i>Mother!</i>

234
00:16:55,724 --> 00:16:59,391
<i>You're the reason I fight.</i>
<i>I've become so focused on</i>

235
00:16:59,491 --> 00:17:03,291
<i>revenge that I sought power</i>
<i>alone. I couldn't see the</i>

236
00:17:03,391 --> 00:17:07,091
<i>power without purpose would</i>
<i>only bring me a hollow victory!</i>

237
00:17:10,424 --> 00:17:11,558
Tch. How stupid.

238
00:17:12,458 --> 00:17:14,591
Are you sure you're
all right? Goku!

239
00:17:14,691 --> 00:17:16,458
I feel a little numb.

240
00:17:16,558 --> 00:17:18,824
That sure was some... fireworks.

241
00:17:18,924 --> 00:17:20,358
[Sanzo] Hakkai?
[Hakkai] Yes, sir?

242
00:17:20,458 --> 00:17:24,291
If you've got any idea what's
transformed him, let's hear it.

243
00:17:24,391 --> 00:17:27,024
I'll make a bet it has
something to do with that

244
00:17:27,124 --> 00:17:29,958
strange blue crystal that's
hanging around his neck.

245
00:17:31,291 --> 00:17:34,358
It must be what's linking him
to the fiend he summoned.

246
00:17:35,291 --> 00:17:38,224
Exactly how did you
figure that out?

247
00:17:38,358 --> 00:17:41,124
Because, frankly, he's
not that trendy.

248
00:17:41,224 --> 00:17:43,891
Even if he were, that's not
his kind of accessory.

249
00:17:43,991 --> 00:17:46,324
Really doesn't go with his eyes.

250
00:17:46,424 --> 00:17:48,224
I'll be. You nailed it.

251
00:17:50,758 --> 00:17:53,524
[Sanzo] Goku! I'll restrain him.

252
00:17:53,624 --> 00:17:55,991
You shatter that crystal
when I give you the chance.

253
00:17:56,091 --> 00:17:57,558
I got it.

254
00:17:57,658 --> 00:17:59,458
I swear, you screw this up...

255
00:17:59,558 --> 00:18:00,958
I said I got it.

256
00:18:02,924 --> 00:18:05,391
<i>[Sanzo] I know this</i>
<i>isn't like me, but...</i>

257
00:18:07,091 --> 00:18:10,158
Maten Scripture.
Binding force of both...

258
00:18:10,258 --> 00:18:14,658
"Kouryuu, the river rat."
It's not a very nice name.

259
00:18:18,958 --> 00:18:21,758
Where light is darkness and
darkness is light...

260
00:18:21,858 --> 00:18:23,391
<i>[Koumyou] It was</i>
<i>because of your voice.</i>

261
00:18:23,491 --> 00:18:25,724
<i>[Homura] You and your little</i>
<i>band of heroes might even</i>

262
00:18:25,824 --> 00:18:26,924
<i>be able to save him.</i>

263
00:18:27,024 --> 00:18:29,358
Where light is darkness
and darkness is light,

264
00:18:29,458 --> 00:18:32,558
I call upon you to use
your power to cast my enemy

265
00:18:32,658 --> 00:18:34,824
BACK INTO OBLIVION!

266
00:18:37,924 --> 00:18:40,058
<i>[Homura] This is the</i>
<i>way it should be.</i>

267
00:18:40,158 --> 00:18:44,224
<i>You should've been able to</i>
<i>hear Kougaiji's soul cry out.</i>

268
00:18:44,358 --> 00:18:47,491
<i>That's why you are the</i>
<i>only ones who can save him.</i>

269
00:18:47,591 --> 00:18:53,224
<i>I cannot. I cannot hear the</i>
<i>voices, even if I wanted to.</i>

270
00:18:53,958 --> 00:18:55,124
Goku!

271
00:18:55,758 --> 00:18:56,891
Got it!

272
00:18:59,724 --> 00:19:00,858
I told you.

273
00:19:06,891 --> 00:19:08,024
Let's go.

274
00:19:08,591 --> 00:19:09,858
Wait, Sanzo...

275
00:19:09,958 --> 00:19:11,491
No need to thank us.

276
00:19:11,591 --> 00:19:13,691
Like I even considered it.

277
00:19:30,853 --> 00:19:31,986
[Zenon] Well, good news.

278
00:19:32,853 --> 00:19:34,453
So you found the spot?

279
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:38,753
That's great-

280
00:19:42,553 --> 00:19:43,686
Okay.

281
00:19:45,186 --> 00:19:47,120
<i>[Homura] There are</i>
<i>days like this too.</i>

282
00:19:48,186 --> 00:19:49,953
<i>Right, Son Goku?</i>

283
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:56,253
Hey, Sanzo, why did you
help Kougaiji anyway?

284
00:19:56,353 --> 00:19:59,420
[Gojyo] Yeaaah, when did you
develop such a soft spot?

285
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,586
It's like you're a
monk or something.

286
00:20:01,686 --> 00:20:02,820
[Sanzo] Shut up.

287
00:20:04,886 --> 00:20:06,120
A voice...

288
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:07,520
[Gojyo & Goku] What?

289
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:09,553
[Sanzo] I thought
I heard a voice.

290
00:20:09,653 --> 00:20:10,786
[Gojyo] Sanzo...

291
00:20:12,286 --> 00:20:13,920
[Sanzo] The river was nearby.

292
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:20,253
And I tend to hear voices
when the river is close.

293
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:27,353
[Goku] What the heck
are you talking about?

294
00:20:27,453 --> 00:20:30,153
[Gojyo] Aren't you monks suppose
to be teachers or something?

295
00:20:30,253 --> 00:20:31,653
Explain yourself better!

296
00:20:31,753 --> 00:20:34,653
[Sanzo] Shut up! You make me say
one more word and I'll kill you!

297
00:20:34,753 --> 00:20:37,020
[Gojyo] See? Now that's
the Sanzo I know.

298
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,253
[Sanzo] Bastard!
