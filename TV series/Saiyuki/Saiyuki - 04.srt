1
00:01:35,201 --> 00:01:37,021
[Goku] Gojyo, you son of a
bitch! You cheated!

2
00:01:37,021 --> 00:01:40,721
[Gojyo] The more stupid they
are, the more they try to
blame it on somebody else.

3
00:01:40,821 --> 00:01:46,288
Oh yeah? Well answer me this,
fat had! How do you get four
aces three times in a row?!

4
00:01:46,388 --> 00:01:47,455
How?!

5
00:01:47,555 --> 00:01:50,188
How?! By cheating, that's how!

6
00:01:50,288 --> 00:01:52,888
[Gojyo] Look, don't blame me
because you're stupid.

7
00:01:52,988 --> 00:01:55,021
[Goku] I'm stupid for playing
cards with you.
[Sanzo] God, I wish you and I
could just do this alone!

8
00:01:55,121 --> 00:01:56,821
[Gojyo] No you're just stupid!

9
00:01:56,921 --> 00:01:59,288
[Goku] That's it, I'm kicking
your ass!
[Gojyo] Well, if you think you
can do that

10
00:01:59,388 --> 00:02:01,621
[Hakkai] Uh-huh, but then it
wouldn't be nearly as much fun.
[Gojyo] then you're more stupid
than I thought you were!

11
00:02:13,755 --> 00:02:15,721
Holy shit that's cold!

12
00:02:15,821 --> 00:02:19,621
Look dragon, next time watch
where you're going, will ya?!

13
00:02:19,721 --> 00:02:21,588
[Gojyo] Help! I'm gonna drown!

14
00:02:21,688 --> 00:02:24,488
[Goku] Wow, take a look at you.
[Gojyo] Come on, don't just
stand there!

15
00:02:24,588 --> 00:02:27,921
[Gojyo] Help me, asshole!
[Goku] I've never seen you move
with this much energy ever.

16
00:02:28,021 --> 00:02:31,055
Oh I move just like this all the
time, in the bed.

17
00:02:31,155 --> 00:02:32,855
In bed, eh?

18
00:02:32,955 --> 00:02:35,855
You mean like a water bed!

19
00:02:35,955 --> 00:02:37,655
[Gojyo and Goku clamoring to be
let out from under the water]

20
00:02:37,755 --> 00:02:43,155
[Shunrei laughs]

21
00:02:43,255 --> 00:02:45,888
Oh gosh, I'm so sorry.

22
00:02:45,988 --> 00:02:50,755
It's just that it's been a long
time since I've seen grown men
acting like little boys.

23
00:02:50,855 --> 00:02:54,088
You jerks damage my
reputation daily.

24
00:02:54,188 --> 00:02:57,455
[Shunrei] You're soaking wet.
You can come dry off at
my place.

25
00:02:57,555 --> 00:03:01,855
I've got food, hot tea, and more
importantly for you, I've
got towels.

26
00:03:16,355 --> 00:03:18,788
Wow, they fit just perfectly.

27
00:03:18,888 --> 00:03:21,355
Yes, thank you.

28
00:03:21,455 --> 00:03:23,988
Yeah, thanks a lot. Hope you let
me keep 'em.

29
00:03:24,088 --> 00:03:27,521
You can't keep them. You will
happily return them when your
clothes are dry.

30
00:03:27,621 --> 00:03:31,755
No, really, it's actually
nice to see someone wearing
them again.

31
00:03:32,555 --> 00:03:34,921
[Han] Oh all right, enough talk.

32
00:03:35,021 --> 00:03:36,855
Oh thank you. It looks great.

33
00:03:36,955 --> 00:03:39,988
Please sit down and eat before
everything gets cold.

34
00:03:40,888 --> 00:03:44,855
No way! Auntie, you know how
to cook!

35
00:03:44,955 --> 00:03:46,721
[Han] Why thank you!

36
00:03:46,821 --> 00:03:49,188
No, thank you!

37
00:03:49,288 --> 00:03:50,888
[Gojyo] Put it on a plate
first, pig!

38
00:03:50,988 --> 00:03:52,088
[Goku] Mind your own business!

39
00:03:53,521 --> 00:03:55,388
[Hakkai] Thank you so much for
you hospitality.

40
00:03:55,488 --> 00:03:56,955
[Sanzo] Goku, don't make a mess.

41
00:03:57,055 --> 00:03:58,955
[Gojyo] Hey shit head, what
about the rest of us?

42
00:03:59,055 --> 00:04:01,555
[Sanzo] They're not my friends,
I just want to go on record.

43
00:04:01,655 --> 00:04:03,855
[Han] I'm so glad all of you
are here.

44
00:04:05,121 --> 00:04:08,121
It's nice to see Shunrei
smile again.

45
00:04:08,221 --> 00:04:12,221
She's been alone for so
long now.

46
00:04:12,321 --> 00:04:13,221
[Goku] Really?

47
00:04:13,321 --> 00:04:17,788
She was in love once, a long
time ago.

48
00:04:17,888 --> 00:04:19,288
Really?

49
00:04:19,388 --> 00:04:21,155
[Han] He was a demon.

50
00:04:21,255 --> 00:04:26,521
About a year ago, a change came
over him, just like it did all
the others.

51
00:04:26,621 --> 00:04:32,755
But he left, before he became
like the others, angry, hungry.

52
00:04:32,855 --> 00:04:37,988
Shunrei still looks off hoping
he will come back some day.

53
00:04:38,088 --> 00:04:41,888
She goes down to river to wash
once a week, like a ritual,

54
00:04:41,988 --> 00:04:44,655
cleaning clothes that haven't
been worn in months.

55
00:04:44,755 --> 00:04:49,388
I think she wakes everday
thinking this is the day
he will return.

56
00:04:49,488 --> 00:04:51,821
<i>Damn and she looks hot too.</i>

57
00:04:51,921 --> 00:04:54,355
<i>Don't even think about it.</i>

58
00:04:54,455 --> 00:04:59,088
Then these clothes, they
belonged to him then,
didn't they?

59
00:04:59,188 --> 00:05:03,188
Well, they certainly aren't
mine, are they?

60
00:05:03,288 --> 00:05:06,455
I wish I had someone who would
do this for me every week.

61
00:05:08,255 --> 00:05:10,588
Wow, it smells so clean!

62
00:05:10,688 --> 00:05:12,855
These things must mean a great
deal to her.

63
00:05:12,955 --> 00:05:16,121
I'm a little surprised she would
let us wear them.

64
00:05:16,221 --> 00:05:18,255
I'm sure it's just a way to
thank you,

65
00:05:18,355 --> 00:05:21,655
perhaps for giving her something
to smile about for once.

66
00:05:21,755 --> 00:05:25,821
Oh my heavens, it may just be
the fact that each of you boys
are every bit as handsome

67
00:05:25,921 --> 00:05:27,355
as her boyfriend was.

68
00:05:27,455 --> 00:05:29,821
Jien was a very good looking
man, you know.

69
00:05:29,921 --> 00:05:30,788
<i>Jien?!</i>

70
00:05:30,888 --> 00:05:32,188
What's up? You know him?

71
00:05:32,288 --> 00:05:34,688
It's a common name.
Probably not.

72
00:05:37,721 --> 00:05:42,388
A common name? He's full of
shit? What's going on?
What's he hiding?

73
00:05:43,521 --> 00:05:45,321
[Goku] Don't patronize me!

74
00:05:45,421 --> 00:05:47,355
I don't have any secrets!

75
00:05:47,455 --> 00:05:49,721
Well not big ones anyway.

76
00:05:49,821 --> 00:05:51,888
Okay let's change the subject.

77
00:05:57,088 --> 00:05:58,488
[Gojyo] Hey...

78
00:05:58,588 --> 00:05:59,921
Oh hello.

79
00:06:00,021 --> 00:06:02,821
I don't suppose you got a
picture of this boyfriend
of yours?

80
00:06:03,788 --> 00:06:06,221
I can see my aunt has been
talking again.

81
00:06:06,321 --> 00:06:08,221
Why do you want to see a
picture of him?

82
00:06:08,321 --> 00:06:13,055
Just curious to see the guy who
would cause a nice girl like you
so much saddness, that's all.

83
00:06:13,155 --> 00:06:15,855
No, I don't have any pictures.

84
00:06:16,821 --> 00:06:19,621
He was a demon, wasn't
he, Shunrei?

85
00:06:24,021 --> 00:06:27,421
Yes. Do you think there's
something wrong with that?

86
00:06:27,555 --> 00:06:30,821
He was one of the most wonderful
men I've ever met.

87
00:06:30,921 --> 00:06:33,055
Not a day goes by that I don't
think of him.

88
00:06:33,788 --> 00:06:35,088
I believe in him.

89
00:06:35,188 --> 00:06:36,888
And I believe he'll come back
to me.

90
00:06:36,988 --> 00:06:41,388
That's why I clean this empty
room and wash clothes that no
one wears.

91
00:06:41,488 --> 00:06:44,621
It's foolish, but it gives
me hope. Do you understand?

92
00:06:45,955 --> 00:06:49,021
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to hurt
your feelings.

93
00:06:51,388 --> 00:06:53,855
No you didn't. Honestly.

94
00:06:54,821 --> 00:06:56,955
Listen to me.

95
00:06:57,055 --> 00:06:59,521
Your boyfriend and I have a lot
in common.

96
00:07:03,855 --> 00:07:08,055
Okay I give. I can't take it
anymore. Who is this Jien guy?

97
00:07:08,155 --> 00:07:11,088
Relax will you? It's not like
Gojyo's keeping it a secret.

98
00:07:11,188 --> 00:07:16,288
But even though it's not a big
secret exactly, I wouldn't bring
it up if I were you, my friend.

99
00:07:16,388 --> 00:07:18,388
Jien is Gojyo's half-brother.

100
00:07:23,688 --> 00:07:27,321
[Gojyo] What I'm try to say is,
I'm a demon too.

101
00:07:27,421 --> 00:07:28,721
Half-breed, actually.

102
00:07:30,621 --> 00:07:33,021
What's the matter, Shunrei?
Don't you believe me?

103
00:07:34,221 --> 00:07:35,655
<i>[Shein] Don't you believe me?</i>

104
00:07:37,888 --> 00:07:41,255
It's not that. I do.

105
00:07:41,355 --> 00:07:43,888
And I want to thank you for
telling me.

106
00:07:43,988 --> 00:07:47,988
It's just... I haven't talked
about him in a long time.
That's all.

107
00:07:48,088 --> 00:07:49,855
Come on, don't cry.

108
00:07:49,955 --> 00:07:52,521
You know, it's not fair to turn
on the tears like that.

109
00:07:53,821 --> 00:07:54,955
What do you mean?

110
00:07:56,255 --> 00:07:57,988
It makes me want to kiss you.

111
00:07:59,388 --> 00:08:00,521
[Shunrei] You're weird.

112
00:08:03,821 --> 00:08:05,221
[Goku] Okay now I got it!

113
00:08:05,321 --> 00:08:08,521
Gojyo's mother is human and
Jien's mother is a demon, right?

114
00:08:08,655 --> 00:08:14,155
Yes, Jien is Gojyo's older
brother, and a full-blooded
demon, because his father
was also a demon.

115
00:08:14,255 --> 00:08:16,721
You're not all that good at
geneology, are you?

116
00:08:16,821 --> 00:08:19,221
Gojyo didn't have it easy, not
as a kid.

117
00:08:19,321 --> 00:08:24,055
All because he was born of mixed
heritage of a father who was a
demon and a human mother.

118
00:08:24,155 --> 00:08:25,588
[Goku] Why?

119
00:08:25,688 --> 00:08:27,621
Because most people believe a
child born

120
00:08:27,721 --> 00:08:31,755
from both demon and man will
bring nothing but misfortune
and pain.

121
00:08:31,855 --> 00:08:33,155
That sucks!

122
00:08:33,255 --> 00:08:35,488
[Gojyo] It does.

123
00:08:35,588 --> 00:08:39,021
But you know what Hakkai didn't
tell you? That it's true.

124
00:08:39,121 --> 00:08:41,088
Yep, I'm gonna bring you pain.

125
00:08:41,221 --> 00:08:43,421
[Goku] Aw knock it off,
you freak!

126
00:08:52,288 --> 00:08:54,955
My god, are those guys going to
sleep all day?

127
00:09:00,188 --> 00:09:02,655
Well, Shunrei, good morning!

128
00:09:02,755 --> 00:09:05,688
[Shunrei] Oh hello! And good
morning to you too.

129
00:09:05,788 --> 00:09:08,021
Oh if you're looking for my
aunt, she's around back.

130
00:09:08,121 --> 00:09:09,255
Thakn you.

131
00:09:11,755 --> 00:09:13,021
Good morning, Han.

132
00:09:13,121 --> 00:09:16,288
Good morning! So what do you
have for me today?

133
00:09:16,388 --> 00:09:19,188
That's just it, I don't have
much for you today.

134
00:09:19,288 --> 00:09:23,688
Demons attacked yesterday in the
woods to the west. I've been
afraid to go out.

135
00:09:23,788 --> 00:09:25,555
Oh no, that's just terrible.

136
00:09:25,655 --> 00:09:28,588
These bastards were smart,
attacked in a pack.

137
00:09:28,688 --> 00:09:33,521
I heard they were lead by one
with silver-hair, mean son of
a bitch. Killed most of them.

138
00:09:33,621 --> 00:09:35,155
[Han] Oh no.

139
00:09:40,955 --> 00:09:43,455
Shunrei! Shunrei!

140
00:09:44,355 --> 00:09:45,655
Wake up!

141
00:09:45,755 --> 00:09:48,855
Oh good morning, to you too.
Time for breakfast?

142
00:09:48,955 --> 00:09:51,421
[Han] No! It's Shunrei,
she's gone!

143
00:09:51,521 --> 00:09:52,721
Where would she go?

144
00:09:52,821 --> 00:09:55,188
She went to the forest, to the
woods to the west of here!

145
00:09:55,288 --> 00:09:59,355
One of the farmers told me about
a pack of demons that attacked
in the woods.

146
00:09:59,455 --> 00:10:03,455
Shunrei heard him say they
were lead by a demon with
silver hair.

147
00:10:03,555 --> 00:10:04,988
And she think it's Jien.

148
00:10:06,421 --> 00:10:09,155
You've got to go after her and
bring her back.

149
00:10:11,888 --> 00:10:13,288
<i>Jien...</i>

150
00:10:13,388 --> 00:10:14,655
<i>Jien!</i>

151
00:10:14,755 --> 00:10:18,521
Yes. We'll go get her and bring
her back, don't you worry.

152
00:10:18,621 --> 00:10:20,688
<i>Hopefully bring her back alive.</i>

153
00:10:31,976 --> 00:10:34,842
<i>Jien, Jien, where are you?</i>

154
00:10:39,037 --> 00:10:42,477
I can't believe she ran out
alone! What the hell was
she thinking?!

155
00:10:42,477 --> 00:10:44,710
You'd run a lot faster if your
mouth was closed.

156
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:46,943
She couldn't have gotten that
much of a head start on us.

157
00:10:47,043 --> 00:10:48,677
She's gotta be close by!

158
00:10:48,777 --> 00:10:51,677
She better be, because I don't
know about you guys,

159
00:10:51,777 --> 00:10:55,243
but the last time I checked,
none of us happened to have
a bloodhound handy.

160
00:10:57,277 --> 00:11:00,043
Gojyo's right. We'll never find
her in these woods.

161
00:11:00,143 --> 00:11:03,510
You should have brought that
stupid dragon. Your bad.

162
00:11:03,610 --> 00:11:04,977
[Hakkai] You're not helping.

163
00:11:05,077 --> 00:11:05,977
We split up.

164
00:11:06,077 --> 00:11:07,743
Gojyo and Hakkai, go west.

165
00:11:07,843 --> 00:11:09,610
Goku and I will take the
east side.

166
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:10,710
[Goku] Got it.
[Gojyo] Let's go.

167
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:13,810
<i>Jien! Jein...</i>

168
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:18,577
I heard they were lead by one
with silver hair. Mean son of
a bitch. Killed most of them.

169
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:25,743
Oh God please, don't let it be
you, Jien. Please.

170
00:11:30,443 --> 00:11:31,677
[Shunrei] Jien?

171
00:11:33,477 --> 00:11:35,143
Well? Anything?

172
00:11:35,243 --> 00:11:37,843
Well I take it as a compliment
you think my nose is so good,

173
00:11:37,943 --> 00:11:40,710
but no I can't smell a thing.

174
00:11:40,810 --> 00:11:43,010
We've got to find her and fast.

175
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:47,843
<i>I hope Gojyo and Hakkai are</i>
<i>having better luck than we</i>
<i>are. For Shunrei's sake.</i>

176
00:11:47,943 --> 00:11:51,210
[Hakkai] Shunrei! Shunrei!?

177
00:11:52,577 --> 00:11:54,310
Shunrei why did you do this?

178
00:11:55,877 --> 00:11:58,743
<i>You'd think I'd be use to</i>
<i>women crying.</i>

179
00:12:00,777 --> 00:12:01,943
<i>I grew up with it.</i>

180
00:12:06,143 --> 00:12:07,310
<i>Mother...</i>

181
00:12:11,210 --> 00:12:13,043
<i>...she was a river of tears.</i>

182
00:12:14,243 --> 00:12:18,843
<i>And I... I was its source.</i>

183
00:12:18,943 --> 00:12:25,643
<i>Maybe it wasn't just me. Maybe</i>
<i>she just saw the shadow of the</i>
<i>man she loved in me.</i>

184
00:12:28,210 --> 00:12:30,377
<i>and the ghost of the woman who</i>
<i>bore me.</i>

185
00:12:33,977 --> 00:12:36,843
<i>What kind of woman would try to</i>
<i>kill her own son?</i>

186
00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:42,577
<i>Would the pain have ceased?</i>

187
00:12:46,843 --> 00:12:49,710
<i>Would my death have stopped all</i>
<i>those tears?</i>

188
00:12:52,943 --> 00:12:56,910
<i>Would they have stopped</i>
<i>my brothers?</i>

189
00:13:03,843 --> 00:13:05,777
Gojyo, are you alright?

190
00:13:06,443 --> 00:13:08,310
Get your hands off me!

191
00:13:08,410 --> 00:13:09,843
What's the matter with you?

192
00:13:09,943 --> 00:13:12,443
You're not made that I told
everybody about your brother,
are you?

193
00:13:12,543 --> 00:13:15,410
If it was suppose to be a secret
I'm sorry.

194
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:16,943
No dude, it's cool

195
00:13:17,043 --> 00:13:20,577
[Hakkai] It's just that Goku was
just all bent out of shape
about it.

196
00:13:20,677 --> 00:13:25,410
Sometimes it's hard in this
group, you feel kind of left
out. I'm sorry, really.

197
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:30,510
[Gojyo] Tch, he really is just a
noisy little bastard, isn't
he? Jerk.

198
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:33,877
Well I wouldn't go that far, but
you're entitled to your opinion.

199
00:13:33,977 --> 00:13:36,443
Aw, come on you know, he's such
a brat.

200
00:13:36,543 --> 00:13:38,977
Actually, I was talking
about me.

201
00:13:40,510 --> 00:13:43,243
I'm sorry, I thought I
was clear.

202
00:13:43,343 --> 00:13:47,310
<i>Damn, these guys are making me</i>
<i>look like the san one.</i>

203
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:48,543
[Shunrei screams]

204
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:58,643
Damnit, I hate it when they
make noise.

205
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:04,710
I don't know man, I kind of
like it.

206
00:14:07,743 --> 00:14:10,477
Take it easy guys, you're gonna
scare her.

207
00:14:12,210 --> 00:14:13,343
HELP!

208
00:14:13,943 --> 00:14:15,077
[Both] No!

209
00:14:25,343 --> 00:14:29,543
Well done! We couldn't have
done better if we had done
it ourselves,

210
00:14:29,643 --> 00:14:31,643
and believe me we wanted to.

211
00:14:33,610 --> 00:14:35,210
Shunrei, are you all right?

212
00:14:35,310 --> 00:14:37,077
I am, I'm fine.

213
00:14:37,177 --> 00:14:41,277
Okay she's fine, I say these
weasles still pay for what they
tried to do to her!

214
00:14:41,377 --> 00:14:43,810
Oh is that right? Well then
tell me,

215
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:46,243
who are you that you think you
can make ME pay?

216
00:14:46,343 --> 00:14:51,043
So you don't know. You don't
know who we are or why we
came here?

217
00:14:51,143 --> 00:14:54,477
Somehow I don't think they
weren't sent by Kougaiji.

218
00:14:54,577 --> 00:14:58,310
Who cares who sent them.
They still need to be
taught some manners.

219
00:14:58,410 --> 00:14:59,510
Amen!

220
00:14:59,610 --> 00:15:00,677
[Demon 1] Alright, that's it!
[Demon 2] That's it!

221
00:15:00,777 --> 00:15:03,143
You guys are nothing but food
to us!

222
00:15:06,377 --> 00:15:09,543
It's very flattering, guys, but
we're not interested.

223
00:15:09,643 --> 00:15:12,210
Hey, why are we still talking to
these assholes?

224
00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:14,643
No wait! Haven't you seen him?

225
00:15:14,743 --> 00:15:18,977
I'm looking for someone, his
name is Jien. He has silver
hair, just like you!

226
00:15:19,877 --> 00:15:22,277
<i>Jien? Silver hair?</i>

227
00:15:26,877 --> 00:15:30,610
What do I look like? A freakin'
information service?
I don't know!

228
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:34,943
I've never seen anyone with my
hair color anywhere, like it's
any of your business!

229
00:15:35,743 --> 00:15:38,777
<i>It wasn't Jien. He's not here.</i>

230
00:15:40,977 --> 00:15:42,443
[Goku] Shunrei! Are you okay?!

231
00:15:42,543 --> 00:15:45,277
[Hakkai] She's okay, Goku. It's
just been too much for her.

232
00:15:45,377 --> 00:15:48,143
She'll be alright. We just need
to take her home.

233
00:15:48,243 --> 00:15:48,764
Yep. Sounds like a plan to me. I
say we get the hell out of here.

234
00:15:51,977 --> 00:15:54,143
[Hakkai] Her aunt must be
worried. We need to get back.

235
00:15:54,243 --> 00:15:55,477
[Goku] Yeah I bet.

236
00:15:55,577 --> 00:15:58,410
[Silver] Hey! You think you can
just walk away like that?!

237
00:15:58,510 --> 00:16:01,010
We're not so easy to ignore,
you know!

238
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:04,277
Especially you, headband, you
should stay.

239
00:16:04,377 --> 00:16:07,910
Maybe you'd like to hear about a
half breed me and my friends
have heard about.

240
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:11,410
It's a guy with red hair and
eyes who looks a lot like you.

241
00:16:17,043 --> 00:16:19,010
[Silver] You listening to me?!

242
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:22,977
I wonder if you're a true
red head! Down below I mean.

243
00:16:23,077 --> 00:16:26,010
Ha! Why don't you come show us?

244
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:28,277
Oh man, I wouldn't go there if I
were you.

245
00:16:28,377 --> 00:16:30,043
They should mind their
own business.

246
00:16:30,143 --> 00:16:32,477
Let's teach these guys
some manners.

247
00:16:38,636 --> 00:16:41,503
Aw don't worry about it, Goku.
I'm flattered.

248
00:16:48,103 --> 00:16:50,803
<i>[Shunrei] Thanks for being</i>
<i>honest with me.</i>

249
00:16:50,903 --> 00:16:54,403
<i>You know, I hope the day will</i>
<i>come soon when humans</i>
<i>and demons,</i>

250
00:16:54,503 --> 00:16:59,636
<i>well I'd like things to be...</i>
<i>someday as they were, if</i>
<i>not better.</i>

251
00:16:59,736 --> 00:17:03,570
<i>And if I had a child, he'd be</i>
<i>happy, accepted.</i>

252
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:06,070
That's it! I'm tired of your
attitude, red head!

253
00:17:06,170 --> 00:17:09,236
Now we're gonna waste you like
we did those humans yesterday!

254
00:17:09,336 --> 00:17:11,570
You spilled blood?

255
00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:13,436
Yes and we'll spill more!

256
00:17:15,936 --> 00:17:19,770
So yeah, wanna see if the carpet
matches the drapes, do yeah?

257
00:17:27,136 --> 00:17:28,670
Sorry guys,

258
00:17:31,170 --> 00:17:33,936
only the best looking girls get
to find that out.

259
00:17:40,570 --> 00:17:41,703
[Shunrei] Han?

260
00:17:43,236 --> 00:17:45,836
Yes, Shunrei, I'm right here.

261
00:17:45,936 --> 00:17:50,436
What happened to me? All I
remember was going to the
woods to look for Jien,

262
00:17:50,536 --> 00:17:52,903
then they came to help me and...

263
00:17:53,003 --> 00:17:56,136
Oh my god, Auntie are they
alright? Please tell me!

264
00:17:56,236 --> 00:17:59,303
Oh they're fine, dear, and they
went about on their way.

265
00:17:59,403 --> 00:18:03,236
I tried to get them to stay
until you woke, but they
couldn't.

266
00:18:04,636 --> 00:18:06,403
Oh no...

267
00:18:06,503 --> 00:18:09,803
I- I didn't even get a chance to
thank them.

268
00:18:09,903 --> 00:18:14,770
They know dear, I think they do
know how you feel about them.

269
00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:19,936
They said they were on a journey
to set things right.

270
00:18:20,036 --> 00:18:23,970
To return things to the way they
once were.

271
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:27,603
When we all lived together
as one.

272
00:18:27,703 --> 00:18:36,670
The red haired one, he told me
to tell you that Jien would come
back to you someday.

273
00:18:36,770 --> 00:18:37,703
[Shunrei] Oh god look at me.

274
00:18:37,803 --> 00:18:39,136
[Han] What's wrong, Shunrei?

275
00:18:40,303 --> 00:18:42,003
[Shunrei] Nothing.
It's just that...

276
00:18:44,203 --> 00:18:46,503
I'm glad Gojyo can't see
me crying.

277
00:18:50,236 --> 00:18:54,836
[Goku] Okay, so the guy Shunrei
likes isn't your brother? Did I
get that right?

278
00:18:54,936 --> 00:18:58,903
That's right, my brother doesn't
have silver hair.

279
00:18:59,003 --> 00:19:00,903
There's another missed
opportunity.

280
00:19:02,170 --> 00:19:04,036
Come again?

281
00:19:04,136 --> 00:19:07,736
She's not my sister-in-law, we
could've had some fun.

282
00:19:07,836 --> 00:19:11,303
Gah, you never fail to
dissapoint me, you know that?

283
00:19:12,303 --> 00:19:15,570
And you know what, Hakkai?
I hope I never do.

284
00:19:15,670 --> 00:19:18,936
[Sanzo] We've got a job to do.
Tell Hakuryu to step on it.

285
00:19:32,703 --> 00:19:36,770
Why are you looking at me like
that? It's not too much to ask.

286
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:38,870
Right? You know what I want.

287
00:19:41,836 --> 00:19:42,970
The world?

288
00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:46,636
The world?

289
00:19:46,736 --> 00:19:49,403
What an insignificant part of
the plan.

290
00:19:49,503 --> 00:19:51,470
Oh, I couldn't care less.

291
00:19:55,436 --> 00:19:59,436
What is the world compaired to
you, my beloved, Gyumaoh?

292
00:19:59,536 --> 00:20:03,370
To have you return to us again,
that is my desire!

293
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:07,936
And the world will be mine once
your resurection is complete!

294
00:20:08,036 --> 00:20:13,603
You can allow no one to get in
my way! No one, not even those
that call themselves gods!

295
00:20:13,703 --> 00:20:15,736
I believe I've made
myself clear.

296
00:20:15,836 --> 00:20:18,003
Yes, I guarentee it.

297
00:20:20,270 --> 00:20:23,636
Good. Spoken like a true son and
heir of Gyumaoh.

298
00:20:23,736 --> 00:20:26,770
Son to him, as you are now son
to me.

299
00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:29,903
And if your real mother
was released from her
pillaresque prison,

300
00:20:30,003 --> 00:20:35,103
I'm sure her voice would
accompany mine in both wish and
devotion, my young protege.

301
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:38,603
Yes, Mother.

302
00:20:38,703 --> 00:20:40,770
I will do exactly as
you command.

303
00:20:40,870 --> 00:20:45,403
As long as my true mother is
imprisoned, I'm yours.
This I vow.

304
00:20:45,503 --> 00:20:51,803
<i>Yet I promise you, true mother,</i>
<i>that I will fight any demon,</i>
<i>any man, to free you!</i>

305
00:22:29,403 --> 00:22:33,836
[Goku] Well, it seems this
Kougaiji wimp is too chickenshit
to come after us himself.

306
00:22:33,936 --> 00:22:37,903
So instead, he sends this girl
to fight us. How lame is that?

307
00:22:38,003 --> 00:22:42,903
I mean, she's kinda cute and
all, but does she really think
she can take down the four
of us?

308
00:22:43,036 --> 00:22:45,770
Well, she could probably take
down Gojyo cause he's lame.

309
00:22:45,870 --> 00:22:47,336
[Gojyo] I'm so gonna kick
your ass.

310
00:22:47,436 --> 00:22:48,736
[Goku] Haha, yeah.

311
00:22:48,836 --> 00:22:52,436
Anyway, check out this next
