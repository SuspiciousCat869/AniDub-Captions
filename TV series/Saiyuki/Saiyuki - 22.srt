1
00:01:44,681 --> 00:01:48,762
He doesn't seem... to
act like he's fighting.

2
00:01:48,762 --> 00:01:51,029
It's like... he's really
enjoying himself.

3
00:01:53,129 --> 00:01:54,962
Sanzo...

4
00:01:55,062 --> 00:01:56,496
What would you say...

5
00:01:56,596 --> 00:01:58,529
...if you could see this?

6
00:02:06,296 --> 00:02:07,896
Damn it!

7
00:02:08,329 --> 00:02:10,062
Kou!

8
00:02:10,162 --> 00:02:11,296
Kou!

9
00:02:25,062 --> 00:02:26,796
[Goku] "The Battle Ends"

10
00:02:35,996 --> 00:02:37,196
<i>I don't... stand a chance.</i>

11
00:02:39,596 --> 00:02:42,196
<i>Not against a monster like him.</i>

12
00:02:46,929 --> 00:02:48,762
This is no joke.

13
00:02:48,862 --> 00:02:51,729
He defeated Dokugakuji
with just one kick.

14
00:02:52,262 --> 00:02:53,762
This is insane.

15
00:02:56,496 --> 00:03:00,262
I fear... the insane
part is about to begin.

16
00:03:01,362 --> 00:03:03,696
Any idea how to stop him?

17
00:03:03,796 --> 00:03:06,329
Stop him? Oh brother.

18
00:03:07,529 --> 00:03:09,429
What were you thinking, Goku?

19
00:03:13,562 --> 00:03:16,429
All right, monkey. Let's
get this over with.

20
00:03:34,062 --> 00:03:35,196
Not again!

21
00:03:38,862 --> 00:03:41,029
Now I'm really angry!

22
00:03:55,962 --> 00:03:59,129
Stop... acting like
you're... enjoying it...

23
00:04:20,296 --> 00:04:23,529
Look. That's enough now, Goku.

24
00:04:25,229 --> 00:04:31,362
Sanzo was poisoned a half
hour ago. He'll die if
we don't help him soon.

25
00:04:31,462 --> 00:04:33,262
The only one who's going
to be hurt if you don't

26
00:04:33,362 --> 00:04:38,162
stop this rampage...
is you, Goku.

27
00:04:39,496 --> 00:04:42,096
<i>I'm not getting through</i>
<i>to him. Uh-oh.</i>

28
00:04:46,229 --> 00:04:47,362
Goku!

29
00:04:49,329 --> 00:04:51,762
<i>It's taking everything I've</i>
<i>got just to dodge him.</i>

30
00:04:59,629 --> 00:05:01,729
Gojyo, get his coronet! Quick!

31
00:05:15,229 --> 00:05:16,362
Gojyo...

32
00:05:18,929 --> 00:05:20,862
Who are we kidding?

33
00:05:21,429 --> 00:05:23,196
He's just too much.

34
00:05:25,629 --> 00:05:31,229
What the hell is that thing?
Whatever it is, it's no demon.

35
00:05:31,329 --> 00:05:33,296
It's a monster.

36
00:05:33,396 --> 00:05:36,596
Yes, but it's still Goku.

37
00:05:50,929 --> 00:05:52,562
[Hakkai] Goku...

38
00:05:57,762 --> 00:05:58,896
[Gun fires]

39
00:06:11,762 --> 00:06:15,929
Pull yourself together,
you stupid monkey.

40
00:06:17,162 --> 00:06:18,796
Sanzo!

41
00:06:18,896 --> 00:06:23,429
<i>It can't be. He's</i>
<i>lucky to even be alive.</i>

42
00:06:23,529 --> 00:06:26,929
<i>Moving around like that</i>
<i>would just make the</i>
<i>poison spread quicker.</i>

43
00:06:29,762 --> 00:06:33,296
Go ahead. Kill me
if you can. Try it.

44
00:06:38,129 --> 00:06:39,762
You wouldn't...

45
00:06:44,129 --> 00:06:45,762
Come on.

46
00:07:14,496 --> 00:07:18,929
I'm afraid I've got
no bullets to waste on
you, you damn monkey.

47
00:07:54,096 --> 00:07:56,762
[Sanzo] Return now
to your human form.

48
00:08:23,096 --> 00:08:25,396
<i>[Hakkai] He's</i>
<i>returned to normal.</i>

49
00:08:32,629 --> 00:08:34,262
Stupid chimp...

50
00:08:52,778 --> 00:08:55,144
<i>Neither of them look too good.</i>

51
00:08:57,478 --> 00:09:02,011
[Dokugakuji] Kou!
Wake up, Kou! Oh no.

52
00:09:03,144 --> 00:09:05,878
Is he all right?

53
00:09:05,978 --> 00:09:12,578
[Dokugakuji] As much as I'd
to finisht his, I am going to
withdraw for the time being.

54
00:09:12,678 --> 00:09:18,178
I know we've been enemies,
but I mistook you guys
for men of honor.

55
00:09:18,311 --> 00:09:22,911
This wasn't about who had
the better skill, but who
could tear the other down.

56
00:09:23,011 --> 00:09:24,544
so I'll admit...
We lost this fight.

57
00:09:27,078 --> 00:09:29,978
But know that I will never
forgive you for this.

58
00:09:33,311 --> 00:09:36,378
No, I suppose you won't.

59
00:09:47,844 --> 00:09:52,211
Hakuryu, I see you're
feeling better.

60
00:09:52,311 --> 00:09:55,778
If you don't mind, could you
turn back into our jeep?

61
00:09:57,978 --> 00:10:02,211
Many thanks. Where
would we be without you?

62
00:10:06,044 --> 00:10:11,178
Pathetic, isn't it, Kou?

63
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:12,711
<i>First we lose the fight.</i>

64
00:10:12,811 --> 00:10:16,111
<i>Then I renege on your bet</i>
<i>by taking the flying</i>
<i>dragon anyway.</i>

65
00:10:18,678 --> 00:10:27,111
I'm afraid... we have no choice
friend. If you live, you can
complain to me all you want to.

66
00:10:30,578 --> 00:10:33,878
[Hakkai] Hang in there, Hakuryu.

67
00:10:33,978 --> 00:10:37,744
Sanzo's in even worse shape
than you are little buddy.

68
00:10:37,844 --> 00:10:42,311
Best thing for both
of you, is to reach the
village before sundown.

69
00:10:42,411 --> 00:10:43,544
[Hakuryu cries in response]

70
00:10:47,344 --> 00:10:52,278
<i>My vision's getting blurry. I</i>
<i>might be bleeding internally.</i>

71
00:10:52,378 --> 00:10:54,511
<i>I'm not sure if I can make it.</i>

72
00:11:06,844 --> 00:11:08,878
Gojyo?

73
00:11:08,978 --> 00:11:12,278
Let me drive, Hakkai.

74
00:11:12,378 --> 00:11:14,544
[Hakkai] Please, go lie down.

75
00:11:14,644 --> 00:11:18,278
You're in no condition to
do anything. Look at you.

76
00:11:19,278 --> 00:11:20,711
Hold on.

77
00:11:21,911 --> 00:11:23,544
Just go.

78
00:11:24,078 --> 00:11:25,944
Gojyo...

79
00:11:26,044 --> 00:11:28,778
[Gojyo] Don't go pulling
those kind of heroics
to show off, hear me?

80
00:11:30,311 --> 00:11:32,144
Makes me feel so pathetic.

81
00:11:36,411 --> 00:11:38,044
[Hakkai] It's all yours.

82
00:11:42,744 --> 00:11:44,744
[Renli] So what if
you are a Sanzo?!

83
00:11:44,844 --> 00:11:48,944
In the end, you're just a weak
human who chants silly sutras!

84
00:11:49,044 --> 00:11:50,678
Maybe I am.

85
00:11:54,478 --> 00:11:57,278
Hey! What're you doing, Sanzo?!

86
00:11:57,378 --> 00:12:01,278
[Gojyo] I don't think I've
ever seen you so brutal.

87
00:12:01,378 --> 00:12:05,678
It's not like me, eh?
What exactly am I like?

88
00:12:05,811 --> 00:12:10,411
Go ahead. Strike me with
your stupid paper fan.

89
00:12:10,511 --> 00:12:13,711
That's what the Sanzo
I know would do to me.

90
00:12:13,811 --> 00:12:17,878
You just continue being
strong, Priest Genjo Sanzo.

91
00:12:31,778 --> 00:12:33,611
[Sanzo] But I am not strong.

92
00:12:35,111 --> 00:12:36,944
[Hakkai] We know that.

93
00:12:37,044 --> 00:12:42,978
But that's not necessarily the
same thing as being weak, is it?

94
00:12:43,078 --> 00:12:45,544
On that note, how
are you feeling?

95
00:12:46,978 --> 00:12:48,611
I feel like shit.

96
00:12:51,244 --> 00:12:56,244
I can't say that I'm surprised.
You were unconscious for three
whole days. I take the fact

97
00:12:56,344 --> 00:12:59,111
that you're cursing again
as a positive sign, though.

98
00:13:02,111 --> 00:13:04,844
Have I really been
out that long?

99
00:13:06,611 --> 00:13:10,044
[Hakkai] After moving
around like you did with
a dose of lethal poison

100
00:13:10,144 --> 00:13:15,211
coursing through your veins,
you're lucky you woke up at all.

101
00:13:15,311 --> 00:13:19,511
You're a very fortunate man.

102
00:13:19,611 --> 00:13:25,078
Truth is, none of us remember
how we got back to the village.

103
00:13:25,178 --> 00:13:27,544
Lord knows, we would have
shriveled up out there in

104
00:13:27,644 --> 00:13:30,478
the desert if that boy
hadn't found us when he did.

105
00:13:33,644 --> 00:13:36,578
What happened to Kougaiji?

106
00:13:36,678 --> 00:13:40,411
Dokugakuji carried
him back home.

107
00:13:40,511 --> 00:13:43,644
But I fear he carried
a grudge with him.

108
00:13:46,344 --> 00:13:49,378
To be honest, I can't say
I blame him for it though.

109
00:13:51,511 --> 00:13:53,144
I see.

110
00:13:54,744 --> 00:13:59,311
Listen to me, if you're
worried about Goku, he's
just in the other room.

111
00:14:01,244 --> 00:14:03,544
C'mon. Was I wrong?

112
00:14:04,144 --> 00:14:05,411
Who cares about him?

113
00:14:06,978 --> 00:14:09,344
[Hakkai] I seem to remember
that you once told me you

114
00:14:09,444 --> 00:14:13,811
never take any excess baggage
with you. Isn't that so?

115
00:14:16,911 --> 00:14:19,478
My bad. Sorry.

116
00:14:19,578 --> 00:14:24,944
I'll have you know, you're
quite a handful yourself,
Sanzo. So be that way.

117
00:14:25,044 --> 00:14:29,144
When did you become
so... annoying?

118
00:14:29,244 --> 00:14:33,644
Am I? I suppose, I'm
lashing out at you.

119
00:14:36,478 --> 00:14:39,378
I didn't know what fear was
until I faced Goku in his

120
00:14:39,478 --> 00:14:43,978
berserk mode. He had entrusted
me with bringing him back.

121
00:14:44,078 --> 00:14:52,278
ME, but I was powerless to stop
him. I have never felt so weak.

122
00:14:52,411 --> 00:14:56,344
But I can't help but be a
little bitter at myself for it.

123
00:14:56,444 --> 00:15:02,111
What's worse... by letting him
down, the results of what he's
done will hurt him even more.

124
00:15:02,211 --> 00:15:03,811
It's just so sad.

125
00:15:03,911 --> 00:15:05,411
[Gojyo] Ow ow ow ow ow!

126
00:15:07,344 --> 00:15:09,878
Dammit man, could you wrap
that thing any tighter?!

127
00:15:09,978 --> 00:15:13,144
Stop your whining! You're
such a baby, I swear.

128
00:15:13,244 --> 00:15:17,344
If it hurts so damn much, have
Hakkai do it next time! Sheesh.

129
00:15:17,444 --> 00:15:21,644
You're the one who did
this to me so deal with
it, stupid monkey!

130
00:15:21,744 --> 00:15:26,211
What's the big deal? It's not
like it was that serious anyway.

131
00:15:26,344 --> 00:15:30,611
Your damn rampage broke
three of my ribs. If that's
not serious, then what is?

132
00:15:30,711 --> 00:15:32,111
Huh?!

133
00:15:32,211 --> 00:15:35,411
[Goku] I SAID I was sorry! Jeez!

134
00:15:35,511 --> 00:15:38,844
It didn't make me feel any
better when you went and took

135
00:15:38,944 --> 00:15:42,911
a quiet nap right afterwards,
as if nothing had happened.

136
00:15:44,478 --> 00:15:45,811
[Goku] I'm sorry.

137
00:15:46,978 --> 00:15:49,011
I feel... awful.

138
00:15:55,811 --> 00:15:58,611
Oh man, I'm just giving
you a hard time.

139
00:16:01,044 --> 00:16:03,611
You didn't do anything wrong.

140
00:16:03,711 --> 00:16:08,244
I doubt we could have
saved Sanzo if you hadn't...
gone berserk like that.

141
00:16:11,211 --> 00:16:13,911
Everything worked out okay.

142
00:16:14,011 --> 00:16:15,144
Didn't it?

143
00:16:15,944 --> 00:16:17,078
[Goku] I suppose...

144
00:16:18,078 --> 00:16:19,878
But I...

145
00:16:19,978 --> 00:16:22,211
can't remember what I did...

146
00:16:22,311 --> 00:16:28,111
These hands... they nothing
else but the death of others.

147
00:16:28,211 --> 00:16:30,911
And I don't just mean Kougaiji.

148
00:16:31,011 --> 00:16:35,311
It could have been you
or Hakkai, or Sanzo.

149
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:37,744
I... could have killed you all.

150
00:16:40,944 --> 00:16:42,611
What'd you do that for?!

151
00:16:42,711 --> 00:16:44,844
Let's get something
straight, shall we?

152
00:16:44,944 --> 00:16:47,944
There is no way you
could kill me, no matter
what form you take.

153
00:16:48,044 --> 00:16:52,478
Whether you turn into your
long haired hippie demon
self, or some uglier monster.

154
00:16:52,578 --> 00:16:57,544
You'll never beat me.
Never ever. You got that?

155
00:16:57,644 --> 00:17:01,611
Besides, I've already decided
the why I'm gonna die.

156
00:17:01,711 --> 00:17:06,144
And that's my friend, is in
the arms of some hot babe.
Do you understand me?

157
00:17:06,278 --> 00:17:09,678
I'm not gonna let you or anybody
else keep me from that, got it?

158
00:17:10,411 --> 00:17:12,744
You do that again and I will!

159
00:17:13,811 --> 00:17:16,111
My goodness, do you
mind keeping it down?

160
00:17:16,211 --> 00:17:18,378
I could hear you guys
all the way out here.

161
00:17:19,244 --> 00:17:23,044
Sanzo... appears
to be awake now.

162
00:17:23,144 --> 00:17:28,011
Well, then maybe we should
take a look at his ugly face.

163
00:17:28,111 --> 00:17:29,744
Slow down, monkey.

164
00:17:29,844 --> 00:17:31,911
Let me go! Let me go!

165
00:17:32,011 --> 00:17:35,278
Sanzo's probably really pissed
at me now for what I did!

166
00:17:35,378 --> 00:17:38,411
He's just gonna wop me
with his stupid fan again!

167
00:17:38,511 --> 00:17:43,311
My word, you were pacing
around more anxiously than
any of us just a moment ago.

168
00:17:43,744 --> 00:17:45,444
Yeah, but...

169
00:17:45,544 --> 00:17:49,711
I think you'll find that
Sanzo is a little more
forgiving than that.

170
00:17:49,811 --> 00:17:51,278
Probably...

171
00:17:51,378 --> 00:17:52,611
Yeah but...

172
00:17:52,711 --> 00:17:57,244
You don't really think you can
just run away, do you, Goku?

173
00:17:59,178 --> 00:18:00,811
I guess not...

174
00:18:04,178 --> 00:18:05,978
Uh, hey. What's up?

175
00:18:07,178 --> 00:18:09,944
What do ya know? Your
owner's here, Goku.

176
00:18:10,044 --> 00:18:14,611
He never behaves himself
this much when I'm
around, now does he?

177
00:18:19,853 --> 00:18:21,486
[Sanzo] Goku...

178
00:18:22,086 --> 00:18:23,820
Yes sir?

179
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:27,853
Could you possibly...
grab a beer for me?

180
00:18:27,953 --> 00:18:29,086
[Goku] Uh, sure.

181
00:18:30,986 --> 00:18:32,786
Here you go.

182
00:18:46,153 --> 00:18:47,253
Thanks.

183
00:18:47,353 --> 00:18:48,886
What were you thinking?!

184
00:18:48,986 --> 00:18:50,453
Ow, my head!

185
00:18:50,553 --> 00:18:52,653
Could you be anymore stupid?!

186
00:18:52,753 --> 00:18:56,720
Aren't I always telling
you to think before act,
you stupid monkey!

187
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:58,353
Will you never learn?!

188
00:18:58,453 --> 00:19:03,053
Hakkai, you said Sanzo would
be forgiving, but he isn't!

189
00:19:03,153 --> 00:19:06,320
That's why I added
the "probably."

190
00:19:13,153 --> 00:19:14,286
Oh man...

191
00:19:17,886 --> 00:19:19,353
What are you giggling about?

192
00:19:19,953 --> 00:19:23,386
I'm not giggling.

193
00:19:23,486 --> 00:19:25,553
You're so creepy.

194
00:19:25,653 --> 00:19:28,653
I think Sanzo's starting
to warm up a little.

195
00:19:28,753 --> 00:19:30,920
He can be twisted at times
but... it's kind of nice
to see his feminine side.

196
00:19:36,286 --> 00:19:40,286
I hope you don't mind.
I brought you guys some
fresh bandages here.

197
00:19:40,386 --> 00:19:42,953
[Gojyo] You know you
can poke someone's eye
out with that thing!

198
00:19:43,053 --> 00:19:45,853
[Sanzo] Only if they aren't
behaving themselves.

199
00:19:45,953 --> 00:19:47,386
[Gojyo] You're one to talk
Mr. High-and-Mighty!

200
00:19:47,486 --> 00:19:48,920
How very kind of you.

201
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:50,253
[Sanzo] Go ahead and try it.

202
00:19:50,353 --> 00:19:53,186
[Gojyo] You know, maybe I
will-hey, what's the big idea?!

203
00:19:53,286 --> 00:19:55,386
[Goku] I won't
let you hurt Sanzo!

204
00:19:55,520 --> 00:20:00,553
Why you stupid monkey!
This doesn't concern you,
now step aside! NOW!

205
00:20:00,653 --> 00:20:01,853
You bastard!

206
00:20:01,953 --> 00:20:04,753
Go ahead and call me
a monkey all you want!

207
00:20:04,853 --> 00:20:07,753
It's better than being a
big red roach like you!

208
00:20:07,853 --> 00:20:10,386
[Gojyo] "Red roach?" Where
on earth did you come
up with that?!

209
00:20:10,486 --> 00:20:13,553
[Goku] If you're not a
roach, then what are
those antennas for?

210
00:20:13,653 --> 00:20:15,953
[Boy] You're friends are weird.
[Gojyo] OW! Stop pulling them!

211
00:20:16,053 --> 00:20:19,586
Yeah, you're right, and you
don't know the half of it.

212
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,653
And for that, you
should be thankful.

213
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:27,186
[Dokugakuji] We made it, Kou.

214
00:20:30,286 --> 00:20:32,586
Yaone will fix
you right up, man.

215
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:39,053
Welcome back.

216
00:22:30,286 --> 00:22:35,086
[Hakkai] It hasn't been
easy, living when the one
dearest to me has died.

217
00:22:35,186 --> 00:22:40,886
In her last breath, she said
she had forgiven me for not
being able to save her...

218
00:22:40,986 --> 00:22:44,320
but I have not been
able to forgive myself.

219
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:48,120
So what would I do if I met
someone who reminded me of her?

220
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:52,920
Would I... could I...
Next time on Saiyuki,

221
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:56,420
I learn "The Price of Devotion."
