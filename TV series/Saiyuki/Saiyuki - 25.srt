[Sanzo] When the walls
seperating the heavens
and earth fell,

00:01:37,894 --> 00:01:42,254

to bring stability to
certain times.

One by one, demons
came to defeat us.

8

And one by one, they fell.

9
00:01:55,887 --> 00:02:01,654
Even the great Kougaiji
in the end, proved to be no
match for the Sanzo party.

10
00:02:01,754 --> 00:02:05,854
But we had yet to face the
greatest of all assassins.

You're hungry!

16

Wow! How did YOU know?!

That's all you ever do say.

Why don't you try saying
something else for a change, you
predictible little chimp. Eh?

same things over and over, huh?

dare you!

dog is without take-backs!

25

[Sanzo] Don't they know they're
just stuck in another rut?

26
00:02:59,487 --> 00:03:01,054
So what else is new?

27
00:03:08,487 --> 00:03:09,887
[Goku] What the hell is that?

28
00:03:09,987 --> 00:03:11,754
[Gojyo] Don't you know a
boulder when you see one?

29

don't you try eating it?

30

Lookit, Sanzo has a little pet!

35
00:03:24,254 --> 00:03:25,654
[Sanzo] Peeve. Pet peeve.

36
00:03:25,754 --> 00:03:26,887
I hate her.

37

play again you guys?

38

Whoopee!

39

[Sanzo] Can't she find
someone else to pester?

40
00:03:37,387 --> 00:03:40,220
I think that one spells
trouble for all of us.

41

Hey, baldy! I'm gonna
make you cry uncle,
so you better get ready!

you play the game!

You're so noisey! Stupid dragon.

I should've known better than to
trust that no good Sanzo party.

48

them before they get cold, okay?

more concerned about your own
safety, little girl. See?

00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:55,276
Weakness?

161
00:10:57,543 --> 00:11:00,276
[Hakkai] Today's been a bit
out of the ordinary, hasn't it?

162
00:11:00,376 --> 00:11:03,610
[Sanzo] Annoying is actually
the term I'd use to describe it.

163
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:05,476
My stomach's growling.

164
00:11:05,576 --> 00:11:07,476
You're hungry already?!

165
00:11:07,576 --> 00:11:09,210
[Spot] Eek! Demons!

166
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:14,176
[Spot] Woe is me!
Save us from them!

167
00:11:14,276 --> 00:11:18,443
Get us away from
those awful demons!

168
00:11:20,276 --> 00:11:22,443
Those demons are going
to destory the village!

169
00:11:22,543 --> 00:11:26,610
There must be some big,
strong men around around
to save us, aren't there?

170
00:11:26,710 --> 00:11:28,943
Oh, but where will
we find them?!

171
00:11:31,776 --> 00:11:33,376
[Gojyo] You've gotta be kidding.

172
00:11:33,476 --> 00:11:36,176
[Goku] Those disguises
wouldn't fool anybody!

173
00:11:36,276 --> 00:11:38,143
[Sanzo] You didn't
even shave your legs.

174
00:11:38,243 --> 00:11:41,143
[Hakkai] Poor guys. We
have to punish you again.

175
00:11:41,243 --> 00:11:44,443
But wait! We were told you
guys would never be able to

176
00:11:44,543 --> 00:11:47,010
resist poor, helpless
damsels in distress!

177
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:49,410
[Gojyo] Come back when
you find some, dumbasses!

178
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:51,610
Yum! Ooh!

179
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:53,276
[Trio] Master!

180
00:11:55,043 --> 00:11:57,010
What the hell is going on here?!

181
00:11:59,776 --> 00:12:01,476
Hey, it's you guys!

182
00:12:01,576 --> 00:12:04,943
So hurry up and
tell me how it went!

183
00:12:05,076 --> 00:12:06,976
I'm afraid there's
not much to tell.

184
00:12:07,076 --> 00:12:10,510
Despite my flawless
performance, they simply
didn't buy the others.

185
00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:12,110
No! It was your dumb disguise!

186
00:12:12,210 --> 00:12:15,410
It was because you two bozos
couldn't get into character!

187
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:19,676
It was because you weren't
in the moment! Don't even
try to lay this all on me!

188
00:12:19,776 --> 00:12:23,010
Oh yeah?! What what was
your movtivation?! I bet
you can't even tell me!

189
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:26,710
It was all you two's fault!

190
00:12:26,810 --> 00:12:30,910
Why can't you just lure them
outside?! For god's sake.

191
00:12:31,010 --> 00:12:33,443
[Porky] Pardon me, master?
[Lirin] What is it?

192
00:12:33,543 --> 00:12:36,243
Maybe trying to flush them
outside is the problem.

193
00:12:36,343 --> 00:12:39,443
Why don't we just wait and
ambush them instead? Huh?

194
00:12:39,543 --> 00:12:44,043
I already tried that! But they
just run away when they see me!

195
00:12:44,143 --> 00:12:46,710
I think you're forgetting
your new advantage.

196
00:12:46,810 --> 00:12:49,743
This time you have us
to assist you, master.

197
00:12:49,843 --> 00:12:51,943
And you know what that means.

198
00:12:52,043 --> 00:12:54,043
[Trio] We can attack
from all sides!

199
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:56,210
[Lirin] Attack from all sides?
[Trio] Yes!

200
00:12:56,310 --> 00:12:57,276
[Porky] Attack from all sides!

201
00:12:57,376 --> 00:12:58,343
[Spot] Attack from all sides!

202
00:12:58,443 --> 00:13:00,310
[Fluffy] Attack from all sides!

203
00:13:00,410 --> 00:13:02,110
Attack from all sides!

204
00:13:02,210 --> 00:13:03,843
I can't believe it!

205
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:07,310
Attack...

206
00:13:07,410 --> 00:13:08,243
From...

207
00:13:08,343 --> 00:13:09,710
All sides!

208
00:13:09,810 --> 00:13:13,643
Spot! Fluffy! Porky!

209
00:13:13,743 --> 00:13:15,210
[Trio] Master!

210
00:13:15,310 --> 00:13:17,343
[Lirin] I'm so happy!

211
00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:20,843
[Tiro] Let's get this
over with and go home.

212
00:13:20,943 --> 00:13:22,910
Why can't we stay
in the village?

213
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:26,510
Because I've had it up to here
with that little brat, Lirin.

214
00:13:29,843 --> 00:13:31,776
Man. What are the odds?

215
00:13:31,876 --> 00:13:34,876
We'll never be able to get
through driving this way.

216
00:13:34,976 --> 00:13:36,743
I guess we should
just head back.

217
00:13:38,976 --> 00:13:41,176
Okay. Well I'm
fresh out of ideas.

218
00:13:42,176 --> 00:13:43,976
Now this surely can't be good.

219
00:13:44,076 --> 00:13:45,276
Why not?

220
00:13:45,410 --> 00:13:48,543
I think that little girl's
a lot smarter than you, Goku.

221
00:13:48,643 --> 00:13:50,543
[Goku] Don't lump me together
with that little brat!

222
00:13:50,643 --> 00:13:52,143
[The Trio laughs manically]

223
00:13:57,476 --> 00:13:59,376
Not those guys again.

224
00:13:59,476 --> 00:14:03,343
I might actually get tired of
beating them up before they do.

225
00:14:03,443 --> 00:14:06,243
[Spot] How dare you
pulverize us before!

226
00:14:06,343 --> 00:14:08,010
[Fluffy] Yeah! It really hurt!

227
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:09,976
[Porky] We'll teach
you to do that!

228
00:14:12,243 --> 00:14:14,176
[Trio] ♪Dun dun dun dun!♪

229
00:14:14,276 --> 00:14:16,776
Lirin henchman number one, Spot!

230
00:14:16,876 --> 00:14:19,843
Lirin henchman
number two, Fluffy!

231
00:14:19,943 --> 00:14:22,610
Lirin henchman
number three, Porky!

232
00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:24,043
[Trio] Now get ready!

233
00:14:24,143 --> 00:14:26,876
It's time to meet your doom!

234
00:14:26,976 --> 00:14:28,243
Check 'em out.

235
00:14:28,343 --> 00:14:30,010
What funny names!

236
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:31,710
Don't make fun of us!

237
00:14:31,810 --> 00:14:35,110
We're not the ones responsible
for our stupid names!

238
00:14:35,210 --> 00:14:37,176
Yeah, that hurts our feelings!

239
00:14:37,276 --> 00:14:40,876
Yeah, but we can't really expect
them not to laugh at us, can we?

240
00:14:40,976 --> 00:14:42,310
[Spot & Porky] No.

241
00:14:44,810 --> 00:14:46,310
[Lirin laughs]

242
00:14:48,543 --> 00:14:52,943
Looks like I've caught
you, Mr. Baldy! You're
not getting away this time!

243
00:14:53,043 --> 00:14:54,643
What a persistent little...

244
00:14:56,443 --> 00:14:58,343
I envy you, man.

245
00:14:58,443 --> 00:15:01,676
Why don't the chicks persue
me like this, Sanzo?

246
00:15:02,643 --> 00:15:04,343
[Sanzo] I will kill you.

247
00:15:05,476 --> 00:15:07,643
Sanzo! Say your prayers!

248
00:15:08,976 --> 00:15:09,643
Sa...

249
00:15:09,743 --> 00:15:10,410
An...

250
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:11,643
Zo?

251
00:15:14,743 --> 00:15:18,843
[Spot] Not THE Sanzo who
travels the countryside with his
friends, slaughtering demons?!

252
00:15:18,943 --> 00:15:22,010
[Porky] Oh it can't
be! It just can't be!

253
00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:23,876
This isn't funny, you guys.

254
00:15:23,976 --> 00:15:28,176
A hundred million lives
isn't enough to save us
from the likes of them.

255
00:15:28,276 --> 00:15:29,243
Let's get out of here!

256
00:15:29,343 --> 00:15:30,643
Yeah!

257
00:15:30,743 --> 00:15:32,910
[Lirin] Where do you
think you're going?!
[Trio] Uh-oh...

258
00:15:33,010 --> 00:15:34,843
Don't even think about it!

259
00:15:34,943 --> 00:15:36,843
[Trio] No fair!

260
00:15:42,376 --> 00:15:44,010
STOP CRYING!

261
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:46,676
Hey fellas, listen to me.
I think I've got an idea.

262
00:15:46,776 --> 00:15:48,276
Here's what we do.

263
00:15:48,376 --> 00:15:49,676
[Fluffy & Porky] I'm listening.

264
00:15:49,776 --> 00:15:51,910
[Spot whispering inaudibly]

265
00:15:52,010 --> 00:15:53,843
[Trio] Yeah!
[Porky] I never thought of that!

266
00:15:53,943 --> 00:15:56,976
I just can't believe we
didn't come up with it sooner.

267
00:15:57,076 --> 00:15:58,743
Well, let's get going!

268
00:16:01,543 --> 00:16:04,276
[Trio] Save us, Sanzo!

269
00:16:06,410 --> 00:16:07,543
[Spot] Nailed it!

270
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:12,976
We never wanted to do
it, Mr. Sanzo. I swear
on my mother's grave.

271
00:16:13,076 --> 00:16:16,676
The evil witch totured us and
forced us to do what she wanted.

272
00:16:16,776 --> 00:16:20,176
We're one of you guys.
Please! Save us! We're
all at your mercy!

273
00:16:20,276 --> 00:16:21,610
I refuse.

274
00:16:21,710 --> 00:16:23,943
[Gojyo & Goku] Now go away!

275
00:16:27,943 --> 00:16:30,076
[Lirin] Spot, Fluffy, Porky!

276
00:16:30,176 --> 00:16:35,943
How dare you even THINK
about betraying me!

277
00:16:37,876 --> 00:16:40,943
I swear it was a mistake!
It was a mistake!

278
00:16:41,043 --> 00:16:43,943
It was all part of
our grand strategy!

279
00:16:44,043 --> 00:16:45,343
It was?

280
00:16:45,443 --> 00:16:48,876
Oh come on! That was all just
an ingenious part of our clever

281
00:16:48,976 --> 00:16:51,310
ruse to trick them into
putting down their guard.

282
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:55,143
Right now we have those fools
exactly where we want them.

283
00:16:55,243 --> 00:16:58,676
You know we're telling
the truth. Just look at
these innocent eyes!

284
00:16:58,776 --> 00:17:00,010
[Trio] You see?!

285
00:17:02,143 --> 00:17:03,976
[Trio] Do our eyes lie?

286
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:10,810
Wow! What a brilliant idea!

287
00:17:10,910 --> 00:17:12,043
Love it!

288
00:17:13,810 --> 00:17:17,843
Stand back while I go
defeat the Sanzo party!

289
00:17:17,943 --> 00:17:19,376
Bye-bye!

290
00:17:19,476 --> 00:17:21,976
[Trio] See ya later!

291
00:17:22,076 --> 00:17:24,743
We make a break for it
the first chance we get.

292
00:17:24,843 --> 00:17:26,343
[Both] Way ahead of ya.

293
00:17:29,596 --> 00:17:32,329
Okay, bald-Sanzo! Here I come!

294
00:17:32,429 --> 00:17:34,396
Goku, you fight her.

295
00:17:34,496 --> 00:17:36,029
Oh, kick ass!

296
00:17:36,129 --> 00:17:37,529
Why'd you choose me?

297
00:17:37,629 --> 00:17:39,963
Makes sense. She's your size.

298
00:17:40,063 --> 00:17:43,063
But Hakkai's the one
who's good with children.

299
00:17:43,163 --> 00:17:46,496
No, no, Gojyo's the one
that's good with women.

300
00:17:46,596 --> 00:17:49,429
Yeah but she's... she's
Sanzo's girlfriend.

301
00:17:49,529 --> 00:17:51,663
You're asking for it.

302
00:17:51,763 --> 00:17:54,429
Now you four jerks
are going to die!

303
00:17:54,529 --> 00:17:56,063
Just like this!

304
00:17:57,996 --> 00:17:59,296
Fine! I'll fight her!

305
00:17:59,396 --> 00:18:00,663
Oh, go cry!

306
00:18:02,829 --> 00:18:03,963
Got ya!

307
00:18:05,063 --> 00:18:06,929
Hey, she kicks ass!

308
00:18:07,029 --> 00:18:11,363
Someone with moves like
that might even be able
to defeat Sanzo party.

309
00:18:11,463 --> 00:18:13,996
If we can help her
do that, we'd be...

310
00:18:15,529 --> 00:18:17,363
[Trio] Be heroes!

311
00:18:17,463 --> 00:18:20,796
Yes! We won't have to
do anything that will
put any of us at risk!

312
00:18:20,896 --> 00:18:22,429
[Both] Right on!

313
00:18:23,063 --> 00:18:24,463
[Trio] After them!

314
00:18:28,896 --> 00:18:30,163
Nailed it again!

315
00:18:33,829 --> 00:18:37,629
Did you see Lirin's moves?
You'll be the ones asking
for mercy now!

316
00:18:37,729 --> 00:18:42,496
We could beat the lot of you
with one of Lirin's little
pinkies! Give up now!

317
00:18:42,596 --> 00:18:45,896
It's futile! Don't
even try to resist!

318
00:18:48,263 --> 00:18:50,096
[Alarm clock rings]

319
00:18:50,196 --> 00:18:52,163
Oh no! Just look at the time!

320
00:18:52,263 --> 00:18:55,063
I better go home before
Yaone gets mad at me!

321
00:18:55,163 --> 00:18:56,829
[Trio] What?!

322
00:18:56,929 --> 00:18:59,663
I have to go now! Bye!

323
00:19:02,096 --> 00:19:04,363
[Lirin] Upsie daisy!

324
00:19:04,463 --> 00:19:06,563
Bye-bye, bald-Sanzo!

325
00:19:06,663 --> 00:19:09,896
I promise we'll play again
real soon, okay guys?

326
00:19:14,929 --> 00:19:18,463
And as you were
saying, guys? Well?

327
00:19:18,563 --> 00:19:21,529
Something about us
asking for mercy.

328
00:19:21,629 --> 00:19:24,263
Oh, no, you got it all wrong!

329
00:19:24,363 --> 00:19:27,196
It was all part of
his grand strategy.

330
00:19:27,296 --> 00:19:29,529
Don't point your
finger at me, dork!

331
00:19:29,629 --> 00:19:33,496
The real brains behind
the grand strategy is
sitting right over there!

332
00:19:33,596 --> 00:19:38,463
That's not true! It's all your
fault for trying to steal those
meat buns in the first place!

333
00:19:38,563 --> 00:19:39,729
It's my fault?!

334
00:19:41,929 --> 00:19:44,163
I've had just about
enough of you.

335
00:19:47,763 --> 00:19:50,463
[Hakkai] This certainly
was no ordinary day.

336
00:19:50,563 --> 00:19:53,163
[Gojyo] So, where are
we staying tonight?

337
00:19:53,263 --> 00:19:56,529
[Goku] I'm hungry. Hey, Sanzo-
[Sanzo] No way.

338
00:19:56,629 --> 00:19:59,363
Hey, calm down! I
just want some food!

339
00:19:59,463 --> 00:20:02,263
We don't want to waste
any more time, Goku.

340
00:20:02,363 --> 00:20:05,063
Man, what the hell?!
You're such a cheapskate!

341
00:20:05,163 --> 00:20:07,329
I know something he
can eat if he wants.

342
00:20:07,429 --> 00:20:10,096
Shut up!

343
00:20:10,196 --> 00:20:13,763
Hey, I wonder how those
three weirdos are holding up?

344
00:20:13,863 --> 00:20:15,863
Who cares?

345
00:20:15,963 --> 00:20:19,763
Tell me again. How did
we get into this mess
in the first place?

346
00:20:19,863 --> 00:20:23,529
All I got out of today
was some bruises.

347
00:20:23,629 --> 00:20:27,029
And I didn't even get
one little meat bun.

348
00:20:27,129 --> 00:20:29,463
[Spot] Hey! I never
got any either!

349
00:20:29,563 --> 00:20:32,729
[Fluffy] I tell you! If I ever
see that little witch again,

350
00:20:32,829 --> 00:20:35,629
I'm going to demand
she treat us to some!

351
00:20:35,729 --> 00:20:38,729
[Porky & Spot] That's right!
She owes us some meat buns!

352
00:20:43,829 --> 00:20:46,629
[Trio] Man, does our life SUCK.

353
00:22:25,229 --> 00:22:28,829
[Goku] Man, what is this,
a tourist group or something?

354
00:22:28,929 --> 00:22:33,729
Nope, it's an armored corps
of demons. Like that's
going to protect them.

355
00:22:33,829 --> 00:22:35,963
Hey, if we beat them
up and strip them,

356
00:22:36,063 --> 00:22:39,529
maybe we could sell their
shields for scrap and
get something to eat!

357
00:22:39,629 --> 00:22:42,529
Any takers? Come on, I'm hungry!

358
00:22:42,663 --> 00:22:47,163
Next time on Saiyuki, we're
"Shielded From our Enemies."
