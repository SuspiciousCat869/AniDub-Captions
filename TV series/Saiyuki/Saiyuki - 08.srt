1
00:01:49,228 --> 00:01:51,495
Where the hell did you guys
come from?!

2
00:01:55,528 --> 00:01:57,128
This is getting old fast!

3
00:02:02,095 --> 00:02:05,528
Hey, what is this? Kill 1 demon
fight 4 more for free?

4
00:02:05,628 --> 00:02:11,295
I'm still waiting for my prize.
After all, we've been at it for
three days!

5
00:02:22,695 --> 00:02:25,462
Somebody out there must be
selling demons by the dozen.

6
00:02:25,562 --> 00:02:27,862
And you know there's not a
single looker in the bunch.

7
00:02:27,962 --> 00:02:30,395
Hey, don't these give-a-ways
usually have free food?

8
00:02:30,495 --> 00:02:33,895
If that's the case then this is
turning out to be an All-You-Can
-Eat Buffet

9
00:02:33,995 --> 00:02:35,728
Now that's my kind of sale!

10
00:02:35,828 --> 00:02:39,362
I know, but it's a little much,
even for you.

11
00:02:40,728 --> 00:02:43,762
Okay, it looks like we each take
about ten a piece.

12
00:02:43,862 --> 00:02:45,162
Well let's go!

13
00:02:50,495 --> 00:02:53,528
[Koushu] Why is it taking so
long to kill these rodents?

14
00:02:54,962 --> 00:02:56,595
Well? Out with it.

15
00:02:59,262 --> 00:03:01,128
You don't get it do you?

16
00:03:01,228 --> 00:03:06,095
Right now they're fighting
reanimated corpses controlled
by demonic powers.

17
00:03:06,195 --> 00:03:10,428
They're wasting their energy
and I'm wearing them down.

18
00:03:10,528 --> 00:03:12,995
[Koushu] Just tell me when you
have the scripture.

19
00:03:15,062 --> 00:03:16,095
Scripture?

20
00:03:16,195 --> 00:03:18,162
Yes, scripture.

21
00:03:23,495 --> 00:03:24,895
"The Death Sear"

22
00:03:31,795 --> 00:03:35,128
Notice anything strange about
these guys?

23
00:03:35,228 --> 00:03:39,528
You mean the fact that everytime
we kill them, they come back to
life like zombies?

24
00:03:41,595 --> 00:03:43,595
By the power of the scripture...

25
00:03:44,828 --> 00:03:46,995
the dead be gone!

26
00:03:52,762 --> 00:03:55,562
[Goku] Boy I gotta get me one
of those.

27
00:03:55,662 --> 00:04:00,062
Defeating those demonic nitwits
is nothing for a scripture of
this power.

28
00:04:02,595 --> 00:04:04,562
[Koushu] I need that scripture.

29
00:04:04,662 --> 00:04:07,128
Our need grows more dire by
the minute.

30
00:04:08,028 --> 00:04:09,062
How so?

31
00:04:09,162 --> 00:04:11,195
[Koushu] Surely you understand
the importance

32
00:04:11,295 --> 00:04:16,128
of the Seiten Scripture. Or have
I forgotten to tell you?

33
00:04:16,228 --> 00:04:19,395
It was used by the gods when
they created this world.

34
00:04:19,495 --> 00:04:22,895
One of the founding scriptures
of Heaven and the Earth.

35
00:04:22,995 --> 00:04:26,695
It governs the evolution of all
life. Everything.

36
00:04:26,795 --> 00:04:28,162
So your point would be?

37
00:04:28,262 --> 00:04:29,562
[Koushu] So impatient.

38
00:04:29,662 --> 00:04:31,262
Somehow I thought you'd enjoy
our conversations more.

39
00:04:32,462 --> 00:04:35,528
Enough with the chit-chat.
Get on with it.

40
00:04:35,628 --> 00:04:37,895
Pay attention, this
is important.

41
00:04:37,995 --> 00:04:40,995
The guardian of each one of
these five founding scriptures

42
00:04:41,095 --> 00:04:43,728
is given the title of
Sanzo Priest.

43
00:04:43,828 --> 00:04:45,395
<i>Sanzo?!</i>

44
00:04:45,495 --> 00:04:48,562
<i>So the little bastard is</i>
<i>a priest.</i>

45
00:04:48,662 --> 00:04:51,462
And our very esteemed
researcher, Doctor Ni,

46
00:04:51,562 --> 00:04:54,262
has just made a
startling discovery.

47
00:04:54,362 --> 00:04:57,262
Doctor Ni, join us.

48
00:04:57,362 --> 00:05:03,595
[Ni] Why thank you. Lord
Kougaiji, I must say you're
exactly the way I pictured you.

49
00:05:03,695 --> 00:05:07,262
But enough with the
pleasentries, I believe my
presence has been requested

50
00:05:07,362 --> 00:05:11,595
to elaborate on procedures
regarding Lady Koushu's lover.

51
00:05:11,695 --> 00:05:17,295
[Ni] Oh. Oh yes, he's also
your father, isn't he?

52
00:05:17,395 --> 00:05:18,628
[Ni chuckles darkly]

53
00:05:18,728 --> 00:05:22,762
So sorry. At any rate, with the
Seiten Scripture in hand,

54
00:05:22,862 --> 00:05:30,295
all we need to revive Lord
Gyumaoh is obtain the Maten
Scripture, Genjo Sanzo
is carrying.

55
00:05:30,395 --> 00:05:33,728
[Koukaiji] So all I have to do
is get the Maten Scripture,

56
00:05:33,828 --> 00:05:37,262
and then the great Gyumaoh can
finally be awakened?

57
00:05:37,362 --> 00:05:42,695
[Koushu] And then your mother
will be freed. That's what you
really want to know, isn't it?

58
00:05:42,795 --> 00:05:44,595
That's right.

59
00:05:44,695 --> 00:05:49,195
Why don't you ask me again when
you have the scripture in
your possesion?

60
00:05:51,828 --> 00:05:55,295
Oh, that really pisses me off!

61
00:05:55,395 --> 00:05:57,562
And I don't care if she is
my real mother!

62
00:05:57,662 --> 00:06:02,428
Hey, getting ahold of one of
those scrolls or whatever is
she calls them,

63
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:05,228
Would sure teach that greedy
bitch a lesson.

64
00:06:08,662 --> 00:06:10,628
[Sanzo] Shall we go?

65
00:06:10,728 --> 00:06:14,428
Okay, somebody had to be
manipulating these guys

66
00:06:14,528 --> 00:06:17,928
Could it be Kougaiji?

67
00:06:18,028 --> 00:06:19,462
Perhaps.

68
00:06:23,828 --> 00:06:25,495
[Goku] Hey, Sanzo.

69
00:06:25,595 --> 00:06:27,762
You know that vest you're
always wearing?

70
00:06:27,862 --> 00:06:29,328
What are you talking about?

71
00:06:29,428 --> 00:06:30,995
He means the Maten Scripture.

72
00:06:31,095 --> 00:06:34,362
Um, yeah! If you don't mind me
saying so,

73
00:06:34,462 --> 00:06:36,495
that scripture kicked some
serious ass.

74
00:06:36,595 --> 00:06:39,295
All those zombies in one
shot? Whoa!

75
00:06:40,928 --> 00:06:43,762
[Sanzo] Yes, Goku.

76
00:06:43,862 --> 00:06:47,495
[Sanbutsushin B] The sudden
rise of the demons that is
wreaking havoc across the globe

77
00:06:47,595 --> 00:06:51,962
can only be caused by the
combining of science and
black magic.

78
00:06:54,595 --> 00:06:59,062
Whoever is trying to revive
Gyumaoh has created a negative

79
00:06:59,162 --> 00:07:01,562
energy that has spread
throughout Shangri-la.

80
00:07:01,695 --> 00:07:04,728
And now, it is eating
away at this world.

81
00:07:04,828 --> 00:07:08,762
I command you to find out who is
behind the revival of Gyumaoh,

82
00:07:08,862 --> 00:07:12,328
and stop them before they have
brought destruction to
this world.

83
00:07:12,428 --> 00:07:15,028
Do you understand?

84
00:07:15,128 --> 00:07:18,062
<i>The evil demon that devoured</i>
<i>humans whenever it pleased him</i>

85
00:07:18,162 --> 00:07:20,795
<i>until the war god, Crown</i>
<i>Prince Nataku,</i>

86
00:07:20,895 --> 00:07:25,028
<i>imprisoned him in Houtou Castle</i>
<i>centuries ago.</i>

87
00:07:25,128 --> 00:07:26,195
<i>Gyumaoh!</i>

88
00:07:26,295 --> 00:07:28,495
The disturbance is in India!

89
00:07:28,595 --> 00:07:31,628
Head west, and all is answered!

90
00:07:31,728 --> 00:07:32,862
As you wish.

91
00:07:32,962 --> 00:07:34,895
[Sanbutsushin C] Be forewarned

92
00:07:35,028 --> 00:07:38,162
We sense that your master's
keep sake, the Seiten Scripture,

93
00:07:38,262 --> 00:07:40,495
is being used for
the resurection.

94
00:07:40,595 --> 00:07:43,628
If they came into possession
of yours as well...

95
00:07:45,728 --> 00:07:50,862
<i>The Maten Scripture in my</i>
<i>possession has the ability</i>
<i>to shatter darkness.</i>

96
00:07:50,962 --> 00:07:55,895
<i>The Seiten Scripture of my</i>
<i>master has power to</i>
<i>create light.</i>

97
00:07:55,995 --> 00:07:58,795
<i>That night I descended from</i>
<i>the mountain,</i>

98
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:01,795
<i>when the was stolen in</i>
<i>the attack.</i>

99
00:08:01,895 --> 00:08:05,262
[Goku] Sanzo! Sanzo, take a
look at that!

100
00:08:10,728 --> 00:08:13,528
All that zombie killing's made
me hungry.

101
00:08:13,628 --> 00:08:15,962
[Gojyo] If we stop we might run
into more of them though.

102
00:08:16,062 --> 00:08:18,895
[Goku] I'm starving!
[Gojyo] Tough shit.

103
00:08:18,995 --> 00:08:21,762
Look I'm so hungry I'll eat you
if we don't get a burger now!

104
00:08:21,862 --> 00:08:24,362
You're damn right you can eat
me, you little twisted
monkey faggot!

105
00:08:24,462 --> 00:08:26,528
You're the one with the
girly hair!

106
00:08:26,628 --> 00:08:31,062
[Goku and Gojyo keep fighting]
When they get like this I
usually just like to go to my
own happy place.

107
00:08:31,162 --> 00:08:32,595
[Goku and Gojyo keep fighting]

108
00:08:32,695 --> 00:08:35,362
[Goku and Gojyo keep fighting]
Are you really able to tune
them out?

109
00:08:35,462 --> 00:08:38,362
[Goku and Gojyo keep fighting]
Hmmm. Nope.

110
00:08:49,462 --> 00:08:54,028
[Koushu] Dealing with people who
are in no position to make
demands would be comical.

111
00:08:54,128 --> 00:08:56,595
If it didn't piss me off
so much.

112
00:08:58,262 --> 00:09:02,695
If I may be so bold as to say
so, it's not everyday you
run into someone willing

113
00:09:02,795 --> 00:09:05,828
to destroy the world for their
own personal gain.

114
00:09:05,928 --> 00:09:09,128
Doctor, is that supposed to be
a compliment?

115
00:09:09,228 --> 00:09:12,628
Well if you don't like that one,
I could come up with another.

116
00:09:14,362 --> 00:09:16,562
Hold it right there!

117
00:09:16,662 --> 00:09:21,462
[Koushu] I will return your
mother to you as we agreed.

118
00:09:21,562 --> 00:09:22,962
But remember...

119
00:09:24,128 --> 00:09:26,495
Your father Gyumaoh belongs
to me.

120
00:09:26,595 --> 00:09:28,962
He is to become his
formal husband.

121
00:09:29,828 --> 00:09:32,295
I believe I've made
myself clear?

122
00:09:33,028 --> 00:09:35,595
Yes, I beleive I have.

123
00:09:41,095 --> 00:09:45,528
<i>Oh Mother, I could probably</i>
<i>defeat even Sanzo and</i>
<i>his group.</i>

124
00:09:45,628 --> 00:09:47,728
<i>But during our first</i>
<i>encounter...</i>

125
00:09:47,862 --> 00:09:50,562
<i>I knew there was something</i>
<i>different about them.</i>

126
00:09:50,662 --> 00:09:53,062
<i>But why do I hesitate?</i>

127
00:09:53,162 --> 00:09:54,828
<i>Is it simply fear?</i>

128
00:09:56,495 --> 00:10:01,528
That's right! Could it be
true? Somehow in my heart
of hearts,

129
00:10:01,628 --> 00:10:03,662
I know just how futile this
battle is!

130
00:10:03,762 --> 00:10:07,762
Nothing is going to change even
if I'm able to defeat them.

131
00:10:07,862 --> 00:10:12,228
But I promise you this, I will
save you, darling Mother!

132
00:10:12,328 --> 00:10:14,895
Even if it means the destruction
of this world.

133
00:10:14,995 --> 00:10:18,862
I will do everything within my
power to bring you back to life.

134
00:10:18,962 --> 00:10:22,262
Even if it means sending
everything into chaos!

135
00:10:27,028 --> 00:10:29,862
My Lord! Lirin's gone!

136
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:32,628
I looked everywhere in the
castle and I can't find
her anywhere!

137
00:10:32,728 --> 00:10:34,228
How strange.

138
00:10:34,328 --> 00:10:37,228
Hey I don't suppose you guys
have any idea

139
00:10:37,328 --> 00:10:40,062
who might have stolen a flying
dragon, do you?

140
00:10:40,162 --> 00:10:43,128
She didn't steal a dragon.

141
00:10:43,228 --> 00:10:44,362
Did she?

142
00:10:46,595 --> 00:10:47,728
That bitch!

143
00:10:48,628 --> 00:10:50,295
What was she thinking?!

144
00:11:08,063 --> 00:11:12,484
[Goku] Wow! Do you know how
long it's been since we've
been shopping?

145
00:11:12,484 --> 00:11:14,718
[Gojyo] I'm actually relaxed.
[Sanzo] Good.

146
00:11:14,818 --> 00:11:18,451
I'd forgoten what it was like
without demons around causing
trouble.

147
00:11:21,184 --> 00:11:24,984
Wooooow! They're beautiful!

148
00:11:25,084 --> 00:11:27,651
Hey Sanzo, I want you to buy be
some of these!

149
00:11:27,751 --> 00:11:29,018
[Sanzo] Nu-uh.
[Goku] Why not?!

150
00:11:29,118 --> 00:11:30,651
[Sanzo] Not listening.
[Goku] I'm not fasting!

151
00:11:30,751 --> 00:11:33,051
Ah just give the kid a meat
bun, will ya?

152
00:11:33,151 --> 00:11:36,318
Brats only whine because they
know you'll give them what
they want.

153
00:11:36,418 --> 00:11:41,351
My, my, my look at how quickly
the droopy eyed priest has
become the mother around here.

154
00:11:41,451 --> 00:11:42,984
Want to say that again?

155
00:11:43,084 --> 00:11:46,618
[Chin] Excuse me gentlemen
over here.

156
00:11:46,718 --> 00:11:49,884
You are all travelers, yes?

157
00:11:49,984 --> 00:11:54,518
Come here, sit and I will tell
you what awaits you on
your journey.

158
00:11:54,618 --> 00:11:58,884
[Gojyo] Heh, we've got no time
to listen to you and your
fortunes, buddy.
[Goku] Please, Sanzo!

159
00:11:58,984 --> 00:12:02,518
Can't I have one little bun?
One little bun!

160
00:12:02,618 --> 00:12:03,551
Shut up!

161
00:12:03,651 --> 00:12:05,951
[Chin laughs]

162
00:12:06,051 --> 00:12:11,718
Tell me now, do you know how
closely you walk with death?

163
00:12:13,584 --> 00:12:15,984
Hey, mind your own business.

164
00:12:16,084 --> 00:12:23,018
[Chin] Yes yes, no need to
answer. I see it in your face.

165
00:12:23,118 --> 00:12:24,851
[Sanzo] Who are you?

166
00:12:24,951 --> 00:12:29,584
[Chin] eath walks especially,
with you.

167
00:12:29,684 --> 00:12:32,584
You can deceive the others with
those pretty boy looks,

168
00:12:32,684 --> 00:12:35,918
but I can see the darkness
behind those eyes.

169
00:12:36,018 --> 00:12:38,784
Sins beyond atonement!

170
00:12:38,884 --> 00:12:43,451
And a scar, yes, a scar on
your belly.

171
00:12:45,384 --> 00:12:47,584
You freak! You're just a
con artist!

172
00:12:47,684 --> 00:12:51,684
Why young sir, I only say
this out of concern for
you gentlemen.

173
00:12:51,784 --> 00:12:55,118
Who am I but just a silly man
who likes to tell fortunes?

174
00:12:55,218 --> 00:12:59,118
Perhaps you would prefer to look
at my mah-jongg pieces.

175
00:12:59,218 --> 00:13:00,951
Mah-jongg pieces?

176
00:13:01,051 --> 00:13:06,384
[Chin] Yes, my pieces tell
people's fates. See?

177
00:13:07,284 --> 00:13:10,051
Things do not look good for you.

178
00:13:10,918 --> 00:13:12,284
Hey, how'd you do that?!

179
00:13:12,384 --> 00:13:13,518
[Explosion]

180
00:13:13,618 --> 00:13:14,751
What the?!

181
00:13:17,418 --> 00:13:18,684
What the hell is that?!

182
00:13:24,684 --> 00:13:28,984
Well Goku, looks like you got
your wish. That there's one hell
of a meat bun.

183
00:13:29,084 --> 00:13:31,018
Looks a littel tough to me.
You try.

184
00:13:31,118 --> 00:13:33,384
Hey guys, take a look at its
breast plate.

185
00:13:35,818 --> 00:13:36,951
It's Sanskrit.

186
00:13:37,051 --> 00:13:38,918
It looks like a shikigami.

187
00:13:39,018 --> 00:13:41,984
He's right, that means it was
created by using black magic

188
00:13:42,084 --> 00:13:44,418
to seal an evil script inside
its chest.

189
00:13:44,551 --> 00:13:47,684
Whatever it is, it hardly seems
fair to send something that big.

190
00:13:47,784 --> 00:13:49,318
It's just inhuman.

191
00:13:50,251 --> 00:13:51,918
<i>That man...</i>

192
00:13:52,018 --> 00:13:54,718
<i>But I can see the darkness</i>
<i>behind those eyes.</i>

193
00:13:54,818 --> 00:13:57,418
<i>Sins beyond atonement!</i>

194
00:13:57,518 --> 00:14:00,718
<i>This shikigami could be one</i>
<i>of his.</i>

195
00:14:00,818 --> 00:14:03,118
<i>[Sanzo] Is he one of Kougaiji's</i>
<i>assassins?</i>

196
00:14:03,218 --> 00:14:04,684
<i>Something doesn't fit.</i>

197
00:14:08,184 --> 00:14:10,018
Boy he doesn't hold back.

198
00:14:10,118 --> 00:14:12,051
Whatever should we do?

199
00:14:12,151 --> 00:14:13,718
What we always do!

200
00:14:13,818 --> 00:14:15,518
Kick its ass!

201
00:14:15,618 --> 00:14:19,684
I don't know if any of you guys
are hungry but I'm gonna serve
up some...

202
00:14:20,251 --> 00:14:21,484
...crab stew!

203
00:14:24,284 --> 00:14:26,484
When are these gonna learn?

204
00:14:26,584 --> 00:14:28,718
Don't mess with me when
I'm shopping!

205
00:14:52,951 --> 00:14:56,151
[Koujaiji] I can't believe she
just left it sitting here.

206
00:14:56,251 --> 00:14:59,251
[Yaone] That's not like her, she
must be close by.

207
00:15:00,018 --> 00:15:02,451
When I get my hands on her...

208
00:15:04,418 --> 00:15:07,718
What's with the act? We all know
that you're worried about her.

209
00:15:07,818 --> 00:15:09,484
Huh, big brother?

210
00:15:09,584 --> 00:15:14,151
No... What is this? I don't need
to listen to this crap.

211
00:15:14,251 --> 00:15:15,951
Some of us have families.

212
00:15:16,751 --> 00:15:19,284
[Doku] Stop being so sensitive.

213
00:15:19,384 --> 00:15:21,518
I understand more than
you know.

214
00:15:23,618 --> 00:15:25,751
My old man had a mistress too.

215
00:15:25,851 --> 00:15:28,251
And he gave me a kid brother.

216
00:15:28,351 --> 00:15:30,251
But by a different mother.

217
00:15:30,351 --> 00:15:33,918
But he was dear to me, as much
of a brat as he was.

218
00:15:34,884 --> 00:15:36,718
My mother suffered terribly.

219
00:15:38,084 --> 00:15:41,118
But in the end I couldn't
save her.

220
00:15:42,451 --> 00:15:45,584
Yes, I see a lot of me in
you, Koukaiji.

221
00:15:48,384 --> 00:15:50,618
[Koukaiji] I'm sorry,
I didn't know.

222
00:15:50,718 --> 00:15:53,684
Don't sweat it, man.

223
00:15:53,784 --> 00:15:55,751
I'm not looking for sympathy.

224
00:16:00,251 --> 00:16:02,851
I have my reasons for
being here.

225
00:16:02,951 --> 00:16:04,518
What reasons?

226
00:16:04,618 --> 00:16:09,651
When I came to the castle that
day you had no idea who I was,

227
00:16:09,751 --> 00:16:13,151
but you took me without any
questions asked.

228
00:16:13,251 --> 00:16:17,151
And that's when I vowed to
dedicate my life to serving you.

229
00:16:20,684 --> 00:16:22,851
I understand.

230
00:16:22,951 --> 00:16:25,751
You listen to me, my friend.

231
00:16:25,851 --> 00:16:29,818
I'm with you because you always
follow your own path.

232
00:16:29,918 --> 00:16:33,884
And wherever that road may take
you I promise we will be there.

233
00:16:33,984 --> 00:16:36,218
You are our one true
lord, Koukaiji.

234
00:16:37,018 --> 00:16:38,351
We won't let you down.

235
00:16:44,884 --> 00:16:47,818
Alright! Who wants a piece
of me?!

236
00:16:47,918 --> 00:16:53,118
Listen to me you bunch of
do-gooders, prepar to meet
your doom!

237
00:16:54,884 --> 00:16:58,651
I'm not really up for this, why
don't you guys take her?

238
00:16:58,751 --> 00:17:01,218
Maybe we should just ignore her.

239
00:17:01,318 --> 00:17:04,918
Hey, Hakkai, doesn't she kind
of remind you of somebody
that we know?

240
00:17:05,018 --> 00:17:07,318
You know, she is a little
like Goku.

241
00:17:07,418 --> 00:17:09,151
Goku, you go play with her.

242
00:17:09,251 --> 00:17:10,551
Aw!

243
00:17:10,651 --> 00:17:12,884
Damnit! You guys aren't taking
me seriously!

244
00:17:12,984 --> 00:17:14,618
I'm not a little girl!

245
00:17:17,684 --> 00:17:20,784
Let me down! Let me down!
Let me down! Let me down!

246
00:17:20,884 --> 00:17:22,584
[Sanzo] Shut up and eat.

247
00:17:22,684 --> 00:17:23,818
Okay!

248
00:17:25,518 --> 00:17:30,451
Oh my. He sure is good a
taming wild animals.

249
00:17:30,551 --> 00:17:31,651
[Koukaiji] Put her down!

250
00:17:31,751 --> 00:17:33,584
What?!

251
00:17:33,684 --> 00:17:35,651
[Kougaiji] Well if it
isn't Sanzo.

252
00:17:36,818 --> 00:17:38,051
[Sanzo] Kougaiji.

253
00:17:38,184 --> 00:17:40,884
You hand over my little sister,
right now!

254
00:17:40,984 --> 00:17:43,451
Please come down and take her,
by all means.

255
00:17:43,551 --> 00:17:45,684
Hi there! It's good to see ya!

256
00:17:47,084 --> 00:17:49,551
You idiot! Get ass up here!

257
00:17:49,651 --> 00:17:53,551
Oh, so you think you're getting
out of here that easily do ya?

258
00:17:53,651 --> 00:17:54,784
[Goku] I'm waiting!

259
00:17:56,784 --> 00:17:58,018
Be right there.

260
00:17:58,118 --> 00:18:01,918
That's better! Let's finish what
we started the last time!

261
00:18:07,384 --> 00:18:08,518
Hello.

262
00:18:09,984 --> 00:18:11,018
What's up?

263
00:18:11,151 --> 00:18:13,618
I was wondering, if you're not
doing anything,

264
00:18:13,718 --> 00:18:17,551
would you consider maybe being
my oppenent? If you want to.

265
00:18:19,384 --> 00:18:21,918
[Hakkai] Why, I would
be honored.

266
00:18:23,084 --> 00:18:25,218
[Hakkai and Yaone fighting]

267
00:18:34,525 --> 00:18:39,092
So it looks like it's just you
and me, Shoulder Pad.

268
00:18:39,192 --> 00:18:40,725
[Doku] Gojyo?

269
00:18:41,725 --> 00:18:43,225
Huh, it is you.

270
00:18:43,325 --> 00:18:47,125
You know I wasn't 100% sure
until I saw you face to face.

271
00:18:47,225 --> 00:18:48,359
It can't be...

272
00:18:49,892 --> 00:18:51,025
Yeah.

273
00:19:06,325 --> 00:19:09,392
It is you, Brother.

274
00:19:09,492 --> 00:19:12,225
But why did you come back after
all this time, huh?

275
00:19:15,592 --> 00:19:17,725
Sorry for the late introduction.

276
00:19:17,825 --> 00:19:21,159
But I'm afraid I've give my
alliegence to Kougaiji.

277
00:19:23,659 --> 00:19:26,692
And once I've made a promise.

278
00:19:26,792 --> 00:19:32,425
No man, enemy or brother, can
ever make me break it.

279
00:19:36,925 --> 00:19:38,392
Well that's too bad...

280
00:19:38,492 --> 00:19:40,325
...because I don't break
them either!

281
00:19:44,259 --> 00:19:45,925
Turn around, genius!

282
00:19:46,025 --> 00:19:48,492
Why you arrogant little nimph!

283
00:20:02,725 --> 00:20:03,892
Nailed him.

284
00:20:03,992 --> 00:20:05,592
[Goku] Not quite, pixie!

285
00:20:19,225 --> 00:20:21,259
<i>He's only gotten stronger.</i>

286
00:20:23,859 --> 00:20:24,330
But so have I.

287
00:20:25,525 --> 00:20:26,992
[Goku] Ready for more?

288
00:20:28,425 --> 00:20:31,759
[Kougaiji] Well what have
we here?

289
00:20:31,859 --> 00:20:33,825
That was quite a move you
had there.

290
00:20:35,825 --> 00:20:37,459
Got anymore?

291
00:20:37,559 --> 00:20:40,025
Aw, that's nothing!

292
00:20:40,125 --> 00:20:41,559
Watch this!

293
00:20:41,659 --> 00:20:42,825
You got it.

294
00:22:31,325 --> 00:22:36,192
[Goku] If you want to take me
on, you can't be distracted
thinking about who you're
fighting for,

295
00:22:36,292 --> 00:22:43,692
or what you're protecting. The
only way to have the strength
to defeat me is if you fight
for yourself!

296
00:22:43,792 --> 00:22:48,925
Hear that, Kougaiji? You're
going to need all the help
you can get.

297
00:22:49,025 --> 00:22:51,692
"Fight Party," on the
next Saiyuki.
