Sanzo! Sanzo!

00:01:43,167 --> 00:01:44,434

[Shuei] No please! Please don't!
Please don't erase me!

9

Serves you right!

10
00:02:17,334 --> 00:02:19,367
That's what you get for
betraying your own kind

11

to take the side of demons you
weak pathetic preist!

12

13

[Gojyo] What's wrong, Goku?

14
00:02:29,501 --> 00:02:31,034
[Hakkai] You don't look so good.

15
00:02:39,701 --> 00:02:42,034
[Gojyo] Goku!
[Hakkai] Will you get a hold
of yourself!?

16
00:02:53,934 --> 00:02:55,367
[Hakkai] His power limiter!

17
00:02:55,467 --> 00:02:56,367
[Gojyo] It broke off!

18
00:02:56,467 --> 00:03:05,601
[Goku screams]

19
00:03:05,701 --> 00:03:06,701
Goku!

20
00:03:06,801 --> 00:03:08,301
Gojyo, get back!

21
00:03:12,567 --> 00:03:14,534
Goku? Is that...

22
00:03:14,634 --> 00:03:19,801
Yes it is. Without the limiter
he's reverted to his
original form.

23
00:03:19,901 --> 00:03:24,267
A creature conceived in a giant
stone where the earthly
auras gathered.

24
00:03:24,367 --> 00:03:26,667
A great sage; Goku!

25
00:03:32,067 --> 00:03:34,534
At last your true form
is revealed!

26
00:03:34,634 --> 00:03:37,401
Looks like you're the demons
after all!

27
00:03:41,601 --> 00:03:42,901
<i>Such speed.</i>

28
00:03:43,001 --> 00:03:44,167
<i>Goku!</i>

29

<i>He's strong enough to</i>
<i>resist talismans?!</i>

30
00:04:14,534 --> 00:04:19,801
Sanzo told me Goku could get
pretty insane, but I had
no idea.

31
00:04:21,334 --> 00:04:22,901
You can be impressed later!

32
00:04:23,001 --> 00:04:25,467
We've still got a chance to
save Sanzo.

33
00:04:27,034 --> 00:04:29,834
I think the spear missed his
vital organs.

34
00:04:29,934 --> 00:04:31,867
We've got to get him out of
the rain.

35
00:04:31,967 --> 00:04:35,301
Inside I may be able to stop
the bleeding.

36

[Gojyo] Missed his
vital organs?!

37
00:04:37,234 --> 00:04:40,867
So there's still an unconscious
part in him that's still...

38
00:04:40,967 --> 00:04:42,701
[Hakkai] I'll find someway to
take care of Sanzo.

39
00:04:42,801 --> 00:04:45,267
Right now you've got to
stop Goku!

40
00:04:47,867 --> 00:04:50,201
Thanks. Nice of you to give me
the easy job.

41
00:04:50,301 --> 00:04:53,467
Well genius, if Sanzo were
concious I'd ask him.

42
00:04:53,567 --> 00:04:58,101
But if we don't find a way to
reign in Goku quick there won't
be a building left standing
around here.

43
00:04:58,201 --> 00:05:01,101
So you just better figure
something out. Now do it!

44
00:05:23,667 --> 00:05:24,801
He got away!

45
00:05:27,334 --> 00:05:32,034
[Rikudo] I'm not running! I will
return and when I do,

46
00:05:32,134 --> 00:05:38,101
all of you demons better prepare
to feast on my talismans!

47
00:05:38,201 --> 00:05:43,034
<i>See? That's what happens when</i>
<i>you let your talisman do all</i>
<i>the thinking for you.</i>

48
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:47,801
<i>I'm sure he'll be back.</i>
<i>At least I was able to</i>
<i>lose Sanzo's wound.</i>

49
00:05:47,901 --> 00:05:50,334
For now all we have left to
worry about is...

50

[Gojyo] Goku...

51

Hey, you all right?

52
00:05:59,234 --> 00:06:02,867
Get back, Gojyo! In this state
he'll strike out at anything
that moves!

53
00:06:02,967 --> 00:06:04,201
Now he tells me!

54
00:06:06,401 --> 00:06:08,401
Shit! He's not playing around.

55
00:06:09,267 --> 00:06:10,901

56
00:06:11,001 --> 00:06:12,134
Gojyo no!

57
00:06:14,234 --> 00:06:17,734
It's just a figure of speach!
Now let go of my arm!

58
00:06:18,867 --> 00:06:19,701
Ouch!

59

him still!

like this!

I'll kill them! I'll kill every
last one of them!

70

You're journey has hardly begun
and your little gang is already
in utter chaos.

[Jiroushin] You, show
some respect!

73

You're speaking to the
embodiment of benevolence her
highness, the Merciful Goddess!

74

One of only Five Bodhisattvas
who rule the Heavens.

75

[Gojyo] She's the Merciful
Goddess?

76
00:07:56,267 --> 00:08:00,167
You must be the one responcible
for placing on Goku's
power limiter.

77
00:08:00,267 --> 00:08:07,567
[Merciful] Yes, that would be
me. And that little runt doesn't
require any regular coronet
either. I might add.

Only the gods have the ability
to forge a limiter

restraining Goku's powers.

eye on this one.

[Goku] I remember the blood
gushing from Sanzo's stomach,

all sorts of ideas started
spinning through my head.

who that was?

longing for.

savior, even though I can do
anything to save him.

Well, I think the one thing you
can do for him,

133
00:11:48,590 --> 00:11:50,690
is to be sure to never let
him down.

134

Don't you remember what Sanzo
told us? He said that we would
never die.

135
00:11:57,690 --> 00:12:04,056
We should take care not to do
anything reckless, so that we
can see this mission through
to the end.

only person who could've gotten
Goku that depressed.

151
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:24,490
Well if you are then feel free
to just go through the window
in there.

152
00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:29,123
They told me to keep an eye on
you, but who am I to get in
your way, right?

153
00:13:29,223 --> 00:13:33,023
Man, I can't get away with
anything when you guys are
around, huh?

154
00:13:33,123 --> 00:13:37,790
With an attitude like that,
maybe I should come in there
and stop you.

155
00:13:37,890 --> 00:13:40,056
Ah relax, I'm just
kiddin' around.

156
00:13:40,156 --> 00:13:44,656
So those prayer beads around
Rikudo's neck, would those
be yours?

157
00:13:44,756 --> 00:13:46,123
So what if they are?

158
00:13:46,223 --> 00:13:47,623
I thought so.

159
00:13:47,723 --> 00:13:51,056
They lit up, as if they were
some forcefield trying to
protect him.

160
00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:56,823
That necklace is probably
what's keeping the last
piece of Shuei alive.

161
00:13:58,723 --> 00:14:02,290
Once the talisman becomes
powerful enough there won't
be any Shuei left to save.

162
00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:06,490
Well, not that I care what
happens to you,

163
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:10,756
but the other two tend to get
a little sentimental about
things, you know.

164
00:14:10,856 --> 00:14:13,056
You're a popular guy, Sanzo.

165
00:14:14,490 --> 00:14:16,690
[sarcasticly] Yep, everybody
loves me.

166
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:18,323
[Gojyo] See you around, pal.

167
00:14:30,756 --> 00:14:34,490
[Rikudo] The prayer beads are
sensing something in the forest,

168
00:14:34,590 --> 00:14:37,290
as if I'm being drawn there.

169
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:38,623
By someone!

170
00:14:40,456 --> 00:14:41,856
Some one I know!

171
00:14:51,123 --> 00:14:52,256
[Rikudo] Kouryuu!

172
00:14:52,356 --> 00:14:55,456
I'll be... You managed
to survive.

173
00:14:55,556 --> 00:14:59,690
Did you crawl back so I could
finish the job, is that it?

174
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:03,423
No, I came to kill you with my
own two hands.

175
00:15:03,523 --> 00:15:05,056
I thought as much.

176
00:15:05,156 --> 00:15:07,923
<i>[Kouryuu] Shuei, I have</i>
<i>something for you.</i>

177
00:15:08,023 --> 00:15:10,890
<i>[Shuei] But these are the beads</i>
<i>they found on you in the river.</i>

178
00:15:10,990 --> 00:15:12,223
<i>Are you sure?</i>

179
00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:17,056
Try and kill me if you
can, Kouryuu!

180
00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:24,990
[Rikudo] Now you will know
some of the suffering I have
had to endure!

181
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:27,956
Because you fled the temple like
a coward!

182
00:15:28,056 --> 00:15:29,690
Repent!

183
00:15:39,656 --> 00:15:44,323
My mistake for thinking you were
able to take care of yourself.

184
00:15:44,423 --> 00:15:48,323
What makes you think you'll do
any better defending yourself
against me?

185
00:15:48,423 --> 00:15:49,956
I'm not a demon.

186
00:15:53,190 --> 00:15:55,156
I just figured it out.

187
00:15:55,256 --> 00:15:57,956
I know what the talisman
hungers for.

188
00:15:58,723 --> 00:16:02,723
Your soul, Kouryuu! Your soul!

189
00:16:02,823 --> 00:16:04,656
[Rikudo] Your aim is off too.

190
00:16:04,756 --> 00:16:07,923
That wound I gave you
must be aching.

191
00:16:10,623 --> 00:16:14,656
[Sanzo] When you struck it
wasn't Goku I was trying
to protect.

192
00:16:14,756 --> 00:16:18,690
It was another wound that has
yet to heal.

193
00:16:19,956 --> 00:16:23,290
I'd really hate for you and I to
be left with the same scars.

194
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:27,590
But the other two tend to get
a little sentimental about
things, you know.

195
00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:30,023
Yeah. Be strong.

196
00:16:31,356 --> 00:16:33,823
<i>Willing to die for no one,</i>

197
00:16:33,923 --> 00:16:37,190
<i>living for no one</i>
<i>except myself.</i>

198
00:16:37,290 --> 00:16:43,356
<i>Vowing to never again care for</i>
<i>someone so much I couldn't</i>
<i>bear to lose them.</i>

199
00:16:43,456 --> 00:16:46,556
<i>This is my mantra.</i>

200
00:16:46,656 --> 00:16:51,323
Great spirits, bring winter's
chill to my enemy's bones,

201
00:16:51,423 --> 00:16:54,923
make his body turn from flesh
to stone,

202
00:16:55,023 --> 00:17:00,956
he who would do harm to me, hold
him fast! Make him freeze!

203
00:17:06,156 --> 00:17:07,556
<i>That chant...</i>

204
00:17:07,656 --> 00:17:10,490
<i>It's a spell that works on</i>
<i>humans and spirits!</i>

205
00:17:10,590 --> 00:17:11,823
<i>I'm paralized.</i>

206
00:17:14,397 --> 00:17:17,797
My, my, this is just
too precious.

207
00:17:17,797 --> 00:17:21,377
I get to kill you as easily as
tearing the wings off a bird!

208
00:17:23,997 --> 00:17:29,064
[Rikudo] Feel your life slipping
away? This is what it's been
like for me since you left!

209
00:17:29,164 --> 00:17:32,597
I've waited so long for you to
share my nightmare!

210
00:17:32,697 --> 00:17:34,130
No thanks, Shuei.

211
00:17:34,230 --> 00:17:35,797
Maybe I left Kinzan Temple,

212
00:17:35,897 --> 00:17:38,864
but as for the talisman
you carry,

213
00:17:38,964 --> 00:17:41,864
you let it control you because
you're weak!

214
00:17:41,964 --> 00:17:43,364
You're weak!

215
00:17:44,864 --> 00:17:47,097
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

216
00:17:47,197 --> 00:17:50,530
I wish your sorry soul had
never existed!

217
00:18:04,064 --> 00:18:05,230
<i>Shuei...</i>

218
00:18:06,297 --> 00:18:08,364
<i>Araya's Spell is too strong.</i>

219
00:18:08,464 --> 00:18:12,530
<i>In a few moments the talisman</i>
<i>will have consumed the last</i>
<i>bit of him.</i>

220
00:18:12,664 --> 00:18:15,930
<i>Nothing can stop that now.</i>
<i>Nothing.</i>

221
00:18:17,497 --> 00:18:18,730
[Rikudo] K-Kouryuu...

222
00:18:20,664 --> 00:18:22,764
[Shuei] Someone said you were an
evil spirit,

223
00:18:22,864 --> 00:18:28,230
but just now, sitting in the
window, you looked like
something else.

224
00:18:28,330 --> 00:18:30,264
[Kouryuu] Did I? What was that?

225
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:37,830
<i>If only you had never</i>
<i>existed Kouryuu,</i>

226
00:18:37,930 --> 00:18:40,297
<i>Then I could have let</i>
<i>go sooner!</i>

227
00:18:41,930 --> 00:18:43,264
Shuei...

228
00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:54,697
[Kouryuu] I have no place
for gods.

229
00:18:56,364 --> 00:19:00,564
Though I cannot believe in
deities, I do believe in myself.

230
00:19:00,664 --> 00:19:02,164
[Shuei] How very like you.

231
00:19:02,264 --> 00:19:05,464
[Kouryuu] I've never given
anyone anything before now,

232
00:19:05,564 --> 00:19:07,830
so yes, I'm sure.

233
00:19:07,930 --> 00:19:09,197
Guard them well.

234
00:19:10,964 --> 00:19:12,097
[Gunshot]

235
00:19:18,464 --> 00:19:19,997
[Shuei] Thank you.

236
00:19:26,692 --> 00:19:31,459
Oh, look, Kouryuu, it seems
that the birds are returning
to the North.

237
00:19:32,647 --> 00:19:38,613
I wonder, who do you think it
was that decided that the birds
are actually free?

238
00:19:38,713 --> 00:19:41,313
Even if they can fly where
they please,

239
00:19:41,413 --> 00:19:43,847
however, if they find there is
no end to their journey

240
00:19:43,947 --> 00:19:46,413
or no safe place to rest their
weary wings,

241
00:19:46,513 --> 00:19:48,713
they may regret having those
wings at all.

242
00:19:49,713 --> 00:19:51,713
Perhaps true freedom...

243
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:57,980
Perhaps true freedom is having a
home to return to.

244
00:20:02,847 --> 00:20:04,813
Anybody looking for a ride?

245
00:20:04,913 --> 00:20:07,280
It'll only cost you 10,000 yen.

246
00:20:12,013 --> 00:20:15,313
[Sanzo] You wouldn't happen to
be heading West?

247
00:20:15,413 --> 00:20:18,913
I'm crashing. Anyone who wakes
me up I'll cut their nuts off.

248
00:20:19,013 --> 00:20:21,180
[Hakkai chuckles]
[Hakkai] Go to sleep.

249
00:20:24,147 --> 00:20:29,213
And so, our little band of
misfits continues their
journey to the West.

250
00:20:29,347 --> 00:20:32,213
Theses guys would rather bite
their own tongues off,

251
00:20:32,313 --> 00:20:35,747
than be forced to dance to
someone else's tune.

252
00:20:35,847 --> 00:20:39,413
Some people don't change in five
hundred years.

253
00:20:39,513 --> 00:20:42,113
No matter how many times
they die...

254
00:20:42,213 --> 00:20:45,113
No matter how many times
they're reborn...

255
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:26,080
[Goku] He's got a vague way of
saying things.

256
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:28,813
And the looks of a snake that's
about to strike.

257
00:22:28,913 --> 00:22:32,813
And he really pisses me off!
He better no mess with me.

258
00:22:32,913 --> 00:22:35,980
Who is this "fortune-teller"
named Chin Yisou?

259
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:39,380
Who knows. But I hope
he's dangerous.

260
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:42,547
Next time on Saiyuki:
"The Death Sear"

261
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:44,147
Let's rumble!
