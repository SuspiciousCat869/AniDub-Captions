1
00:01:38,487 --> 00:01:42,954
[Koushu] You do understand
that I'm counting on you people.

2
00:01:43,054 --> 00:01:46,054
Do try not to disappoint
me again.

3
00:01:47,487 --> 00:01:51,854
How one measly monk can cause
you so much trouble is
beyond me.

4
00:01:54,221 --> 00:01:57,687
You wouldn't say that if you ver
tried fighting Sanzo yourself.

5
00:01:57,787 --> 00:01:59,721
Really?

6
00:01:59,854 --> 00:02:04,421
Then I take it you have no
objections to my trying a
more hands on approach.

7
00:02:04,521 --> 00:02:06,787
[Kougaji] You're always welcome
to try.

8
00:02:08,187 --> 00:02:10,287
[Ni] Lady Koushu,

9
00:02:10,387 --> 00:02:13,054
perhaps I could interest you in
a rare piece of fruit.

10
00:02:13,754 --> 00:02:14,887
[Koushu] Show me.

11
00:02:21,354 --> 00:02:23,921
It might help wash away some
of the bitterness

12
00:02:24,021 --> 00:02:27,454
and replace it with the sweet
taste of revenge.

13
00:02:33,821 --> 00:02:35,587
"The Forbidden Fruit"

14
00:02:40,721 --> 00:02:42,321
[Goku] I'm starving!

15
00:02:42,421 --> 00:02:44,787
[Gojyo] We just ate for crying
out loud!

16
00:02:44,887 --> 00:02:47,754
[Goku] You call that eating?
Nibbling more like.

17
00:02:47,854 --> 00:02:49,287
Got some bad news.

18
00:02:49,387 --> 00:02:51,921
We seem to have run out of all
our supplies.

19
00:02:52,021 --> 00:02:53,454
What?!

20
00:02:53,554 --> 00:02:56,021
For pete's sake, here, eat this.

21
00:02:56,121 --> 00:02:58,421
Are you sure? Thank you!

22
00:02:59,987 --> 00:03:01,587
Blagh! What is this?!

23
00:03:01,687 --> 00:03:02,821
Used klenex.

24
00:03:02,921 --> 00:03:04,221
Asswipe!

25
00:03:04,321 --> 00:03:06,654
It's your fault for being so
patheticly gullible.

26
00:03:06,787 --> 00:03:08,921
[Goku] This time you've really
done it!

27
00:03:09,021 --> 00:03:10,121
[Gojyo] You did it to yourself.

28
00:03:10,221 --> 00:03:11,654
[Goku] Eat this, dickwad!

29
00:03:11,754 --> 00:03:12,887
[Gojyo] Bite me!

30
00:03:15,587 --> 00:03:17,721
Something smells delicious!

31
00:03:17,821 --> 00:03:19,621
[Sanzo] You've got to be joking.

32
00:03:19,721 --> 00:03:21,754
[Goku] Quick, turn right here!

33
00:03:21,854 --> 00:03:23,487
[Hakkai] Whoa! Let go of the
steering wheel!

34
00:03:27,954 --> 00:03:29,687
[Lirin's stomach growls]

35
00:03:29,787 --> 00:03:31,121
Now I'm famished.

36
00:03:31,221 --> 00:03:33,854
Nature walks sure make
me hungry.

37
00:03:35,387 --> 00:03:37,621
I smell something tasty!

38
00:03:42,554 --> 00:03:44,054
[Lirin] Mount Dumpling.

39
00:03:45,654 --> 00:03:47,521
That sounds promising.

40
00:03:47,621 --> 00:03:50,187
I bet they have food up
there somewhere.

41
00:03:50,987 --> 00:03:53,287
[Lirin] Ah! Not you guys again!

42
00:03:53,387 --> 00:03:55,087
Prepare to meet your doom!

43
00:03:55,187 --> 00:03:57,921
What the hell do you think
you're doing here?

44
00:03:58,021 --> 00:03:59,221
[Lirin] What are YOU doing here?

45
00:03:59,321 --> 00:04:00,487
[Goku and Lirin's
stomaches growl]

46
00:04:03,854 --> 00:04:05,121
[Goku] I smelled it first!

47
00:04:05,221 --> 00:04:06,821
[Lirin] I was here before you!

48
00:04:09,521 --> 00:04:12,254
I swear, they have the exact
same behavior.

49
00:04:12,354 --> 00:04:17,387
If I didn't know any better, I'd
say she was Goku's little
sister than Kougaiji's.

50
00:04:18,821 --> 00:04:20,854
[Lirin] Yipee! What a
huge tree!

51
00:04:21,787 --> 00:04:22,754
[Goku] Out of my way!

52
00:04:22,854 --> 00:04:23,721
[Lirin] Hey, not fair!

53
00:04:23,821 --> 00:04:25,187
Ow!

54
00:04:25,287 --> 00:04:27,687
Ow! This tree branch stung me!

55
00:04:27,787 --> 00:04:29,621
[Goku] What a weird tree.

56
00:04:29,721 --> 00:04:30,854
Oh, well.

57
00:04:32,087 --> 00:04:34,521
What the hell's going on here?

58
00:04:35,521 --> 00:04:36,654
That's mine!

59
00:04:37,554 --> 00:04:39,654
What the? Now it's bad.

60
00:04:43,787 --> 00:04:45,854
Man, what a mean tree!

61
00:04:45,954 --> 00:04:47,554
[to the tree] Will you stop
teasing me?

62
00:04:47,654 --> 00:04:49,054
[Sanzo] You idiots!

63
00:04:50,854 --> 00:04:52,087
What's the big idea?!

64
00:04:52,187 --> 00:04:54,254
You two are trespassing in here.

65
00:04:54,354 --> 00:04:58,287
You know, he's right. You should
ask the people in the temple for
permission first.

66
00:04:58,387 --> 00:04:59,821
But what if they say no?

67
00:04:59,921 --> 00:05:02,454
Can't you see I'm freakin'
starve to death over here?

68
00:05:02,554 --> 00:05:07,687
Yeah! Besides we already tried
to eat them, but all the fruit
are rotten!

69
00:05:09,387 --> 00:05:13,121
[Goku] And they smell so
tasty too.

70
00:05:13,221 --> 00:05:16,021
[Gojyo] What are you wasting
your time for if they're not
even edible?

71
00:05:16,121 --> 00:05:18,254
Besides, where is everybody?

72
00:05:19,887 --> 00:05:22,321
[Hakkai] Hello?!
Is anybody here?!

73
00:05:27,521 --> 00:05:29,354
Who are you?

74
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:33,554
[Hakkai] Just travelers are on
our way West, no one to be
suspicious about.

75
00:05:33,654 --> 00:05:34,887
Despite how we look.

76
00:05:34,987 --> 00:05:37,021
Don't you look at me when you
say that.

77
00:05:37,121 --> 00:05:39,221
Hey, do you have anything to
eat around here?

78
00:05:39,321 --> 00:05:41,421
We're really very hungry.

79
00:05:43,054 --> 00:05:44,654
[Chinpu] You are travelers?

80
00:05:44,754 --> 00:05:45,887
Twins?

81
00:05:46,454 --> 00:05:48,621
Excuse me, are you?

82
00:05:48,721 --> 00:05:52,454
You couldn't possibly be the
legenday monk Sanzo, could you?

83
00:05:52,554 --> 00:05:54,321
No, you have the wrong guy.

84
00:05:54,454 --> 00:05:57,321
I don't get it. Just tell them
who you are, Sanzo.

85
00:05:57,421 --> 00:05:58,787
What have you got to hide?

86
00:05:58,887 --> 00:06:00,221
You two are dead.

87
00:06:00,321 --> 00:06:03,521
Now, now, all you have to do is
do is something Sanzo-like.

88
00:06:03,621 --> 00:06:05,421
And we get free room and board.

89
00:06:05,521 --> 00:06:10,321
You can put up with a little
hero worship for us, can't you,
oh elusterious one?

90
00:06:10,421 --> 00:06:12,554
No, I can't.

91
00:06:14,721 --> 00:06:18,454
[Chinpu] My name is Chinpu. I am
an apprentice here at Gosoukan.

92
00:06:18,554 --> 00:06:22,187
[Mingetsu] I am Mingetsu.
Please come in, Priest Sanzo.

93
00:06:22,287 --> 00:06:24,221
[Sanzo] [quietly] What a pain in
the ass.

94
00:06:24,321 --> 00:06:26,854
[Chinpu] As you can see we
live modestly.

95
00:06:26,987 --> 00:06:29,621
[Mingetsu] But please, take
what we can offer you.

96
00:06:30,887 --> 00:06:32,154
What's this?

97
00:06:33,521 --> 00:06:36,287
[Chinpu] It is called soukantan.

98
00:06:36,387 --> 00:06:38,421
Made from ninjinka seeds.

99
00:06:38,521 --> 00:06:40,821
Two are enough to make you
full. Eat.

100
00:06:40,921 --> 00:06:44,687
I'm sorry, but I'm afraid this
is all we have to offer you.

101
00:06:46,021 --> 00:06:48,487
Well, I guess if they'll fill
me up, bon appitete.

102
00:06:48,587 --> 00:06:50,021
Down the hatch!

103
00:06:50,554 --> 00:06:52,587
No! Don't eat!

104
00:06:52,687 --> 00:06:55,154
Why the hell not?!

105
00:06:55,254 --> 00:06:58,387
So why don't I see anyone else
at this temple, huh?

106
00:06:58,487 --> 00:07:02,821
Well, usually our senior
disciples are here but they...

107
00:07:02,921 --> 00:07:07,887
They all left on with our
master about a month or so
ago to set off on some journey.

108
00:07:12,487 --> 00:07:15,454
And you two have been watching
the temple alone all this time?

109
00:07:15,554 --> 00:07:17,721
[Chinpu] Yes.
[Gojyo] I'm just surprised

110
00:07:17,821 --> 00:07:21,021
you haven't been attacked by
burglars or demons since then.

111
00:07:22,854 --> 00:07:26,121
That is probably only because we
have the holy powers of the

112
00:07:26,221 --> 00:07:29,154
ninjinka here to protect us
from harm.

113
00:07:29,254 --> 00:07:31,554
[Goku] Speaking of which, why
can't you eat them?

114
00:07:31,654 --> 00:07:33,987
[Lirin] They rotted the second
we touched 'em.

115
00:07:34,121 --> 00:07:37,721
You need special tools, called
kingekishi and tanban,

116
00:07:37,821 --> 00:07:40,287
if you want to be able to pick
the fruit from the tree.

117
00:07:40,387 --> 00:07:44,154
Besides, the fruit of the
ninjinka are not yet ripe
to pick.

118
00:07:44,254 --> 00:07:47,121
[Goku] I figured that much out.

119
00:07:47,221 --> 00:07:49,487
Thank you, but we must go.

120
00:07:49,587 --> 00:07:53,287
You wouldn't dare make us go
without eating at least a
snack, would you?

121
00:07:53,387 --> 00:07:54,454
[Sanzo] Yes, I would.

122
00:07:54,554 --> 00:07:55,487
But can't we just.

123
00:07:55,587 --> 00:07:57,921
[Sanzo] Never mind, let's go!

124
00:07:58,021 --> 00:08:01,321
Well, I'm not in a hurry, so
I'm going to try one!

125
00:08:02,754 --> 00:08:04,721
Guh tastes like puke!

126
00:08:08,087 --> 00:08:10,621
[Lirin] Bye! See ya later!

127
00:08:10,721 --> 00:08:13,354
What the hell is that little
girl on?

128
00:08:13,454 --> 00:08:14,554
Let's go.

129
00:08:14,654 --> 00:08:15,787
[Chinpu] Wait.

130
00:08:16,721 --> 00:08:17,954
Please take this.

131
00:08:18,054 --> 00:08:21,587
It will help to ease your hunger
while on your journey.

132
00:08:21,687 --> 00:08:23,554
[Goku] Thank you! You're the
greatest!

133
00:08:23,654 --> 00:08:26,487
We have not had guests in so
long. It's too bad.

134
00:08:26,587 --> 00:08:30,021
We would have liked you to
stay with us until our
master returned.

135
00:08:30,121 --> 00:08:31,621
But we understand.

136
00:08:32,821 --> 00:08:34,587
[Sanzo] Goku, what's the
hold up?

137
00:08:34,687 --> 00:08:35,954
[Gojyo] Will you get down
here, monkey!

138
00:08:36,054 --> 00:08:38,054
Don't call me that!

139
00:08:38,154 --> 00:08:40,987
[Goku] You two wait here for
a moment! I'll be right back.

140
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:42,821
You sensed it?

141
00:08:42,921 --> 00:08:45,454
Yeah, they're definitely demons.

142
00:08:45,554 --> 00:08:48,521
What do you think? Should we
go back there and take 'em out?

143
00:08:48,621 --> 00:08:52,254
Who do you think we are?
Some champions of justice
or something?.

144
00:08:52,354 --> 00:08:54,854
I'd just as soon not get
involved with those two.

145
00:08:54,954 --> 00:08:57,987
Hey, guys! Those poor kids said
they're lonely!

146
00:08:58,087 --> 00:09:00,521
Let's stay with them just a
little while!

147
00:09:00,621 --> 00:09:04,021
Let's go. There's something
that's just not right about
those two.

148
00:09:04,121 --> 00:09:05,421
[Goku] What do you mean?

149
00:09:05,521 --> 00:09:07,254
Can't you see that the ninjinka

150
00:09:07,354 --> 00:09:10,187
allows them both to cover up
their demon scent?

151
00:09:10,287 --> 00:09:12,587
But take a look at what they
gave me.

152
00:09:12,687 --> 00:09:14,887
Isn't it possible they're
good demons?

153
00:09:15,021 --> 00:09:19,687
Goku, I don't think it's safe
to put too much faith in other
people right now.

154
00:09:19,787 --> 00:09:22,587
Why should I have to
distrust people?

155
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:25,354
[Sanzo] Enough, it's pointless
trying to reason with him.

156
00:09:25,454 --> 00:09:27,954
[Goku] Hey, you give that back!
It's mine!

157
00:09:28,054 --> 00:09:30,754
You shut up! Your idiocy
is breath taking.

158
00:09:30,854 --> 00:09:33,754
Okay, so I'm an idiot! What's
wrong with that huh?

159
00:09:35,087 --> 00:09:36,887
[Gojyo] Just where in the hell
do you think you're going?

160
00:09:36,987 --> 00:09:41,487
I'm going back! To prove you're
wrong about those guys!

161
00:09:41,587 --> 00:09:43,287
[Hakkai] Come on, Goku!

162
00:09:43,387 --> 00:09:45,587
Ugh. Should we go after him?

163
00:09:45,687 --> 00:09:47,854
No. We should probably just
let him go.

164
00:09:47,954 --> 00:09:48,654
It'll be useless to try and talk
to him anyway.

165
00:09:50,487 --> 00:09:54,321
I'm afraid some lessons can only
be learned by living with
our mistakes.

166
00:09:55,221 --> 00:09:57,487
Fine, so I may be an idiot,

167
00:09:57,587 --> 00:10:01,221
but if I can never trust anyone

168
00:10:01,321 --> 00:10:04,487
...I'd rather be stupid than go
on living like that.

169
00:10:08,654 --> 00:10:12,487
I'm not feeling so good.

170
00:10:25,887 --> 00:10:29,787
[Mingetsu] It was truly good of
you to come back. Please eat.

171
00:10:29,887 --> 00:10:31,687
Right, okay, here goes!

172
00:10:35,554 --> 00:10:37,587
Those are truly awful!

173
00:10:38,187 --> 00:10:40,054
But I feel just dandy.

174
00:10:40,154 --> 00:10:43,154
I just knew that Sanzo had
pegged you guys all wrong.

175
00:10:45,921 --> 00:10:47,254
[Mingetsu] He ate it.

176
00:10:47,354 --> 00:10:49,454
[Chinpu] Yes. We did well.

177
00:10:49,554 --> 00:10:52,221
[Mingetsu] Too bad we let Sanzo
and the others get away.

178
00:10:52,321 --> 00:10:56,354
Luckily we already collected his
DNA data. That should be enough.

179
00:10:58,021 --> 00:10:59,154
Well thank you!

180
00:11:04,021 --> 00:11:05,454
[Goku] I'll be going now.

181
00:11:14,087 --> 00:11:15,221
You guys...

182
00:11:19,354 --> 00:11:21,421
[Goku] You really are the
bad guys.

183
00:11:32,189 --> 00:11:34,509
[Hakkai] Goku's certainly been
gone awhile.

184
00:11:34,509 --> 00:11:37,775
[Gojyo] I suppose that means
we have to camp out in this
place, huh?

185
00:11:37,875 --> 00:11:41,742
I don't mean this as an omage or
anything but I'm hungry.

186
00:11:43,075 --> 00:11:45,609
Hey, look here.

187
00:11:45,709 --> 00:11:48,809
[Lirin] I have to go there.
I have to go there.

188
00:11:48,909 --> 00:11:52,209
I have to go there.
I have to go there.

189
00:11:52,309 --> 00:11:53,842
[Hakkai] Lirin, where are
you going?

190
00:11:55,375 --> 00:11:56,575
Lirin!

191
00:12:01,509 --> 00:12:05,009
[Lirin] I have to go there.
I have to go there.

192
00:12:05,109 --> 00:12:05,942
I have to go there.

193
00:12:06,042 --> 00:12:07,275
What do you make of that?

194
00:12:09,342 --> 00:12:11,909
I'd say it means that...

195
00:12:12,009 --> 00:12:13,775
...we should never eat these.

196
00:12:17,242 --> 00:12:18,742
What's the matter?

197
00:12:18,842 --> 00:12:20,475
Considering how many
seeds he ate,

198
00:12:20,575 --> 00:12:24,442
the ninjinka buds should have
burst through his body long
before now.

199
00:12:24,542 --> 00:12:26,642
It's the demon limiter.

200
00:12:26,742 --> 00:12:29,442
It's suppressing the power of
the seeds.

201
00:12:30,975 --> 00:12:32,909
Then if we take this
thing off...

202
00:12:33,009 --> 00:12:34,309
Get away!

203
00:12:34,409 --> 00:12:37,642
How dare you trick me?!
I trusted you!

204
00:12:37,775 --> 00:12:40,442
[Goku] I promise, you'll pay
dearly for this!

205
00:12:46,709 --> 00:12:49,375
And I keep my word!

206
00:12:56,175 --> 00:12:58,875
[Gojyo] I had no idea it was
like this behind the mountain.

207
00:12:58,975 --> 00:13:02,275
[Hakkai] So, you think maybe we
should stop her?

208
00:13:02,375 --> 00:13:03,542
[Sanzo] How?

209
00:13:03,642 --> 00:13:04,775
[Hakkai] Good point.

210
00:13:07,309 --> 00:13:09,375
[Sanzo] So those are the roots
of the ninjinka.

211
00:13:14,309 --> 00:13:15,642
[Hakkai] Will you look at that.

212
00:13:15,742 --> 00:13:17,742
[Sanzo] I see, human bulbs.

213
00:13:17,842 --> 00:13:20,709
[Hakkai] The plant is using
these people as fertilizer.

214
00:13:20,809 --> 00:13:21,809
[Gojyo] I'm seeing double.

215
00:13:21,909 --> 00:13:24,842
Then, who were the two in
the temple?

216
00:13:24,942 --> 00:13:28,475
[Chingenshi] Pardon me. Could
you be Priest Sanzo?

217
00:13:28,575 --> 00:13:29,575
[Sanzo] And you are?

218
00:13:29,675 --> 00:13:33,042
You must pardon my manners.
I am Chingenshi.

219
00:13:33,909 --> 00:13:36,675
Who serves as the head
of Gosoukan.

220
00:13:36,775 --> 00:13:38,442
Truly impressive.

221
00:13:38,542 --> 00:13:42,509
How do you maintain
consciousness with this
thing draining all your chi?

222
00:13:42,609 --> 00:13:45,409
Oh I doubt I'll last
much longer.

223
00:13:45,509 --> 00:13:50,842
The ninjinka's super natural
powers increase by the day.

224
00:13:50,942 --> 00:13:52,709
Tell me what happened here.

225
00:13:53,375 --> 00:13:54,875
[Goku yells]

226
00:13:54,975 --> 00:13:56,642
This guy's a monster.

227
00:13:56,742 --> 00:13:59,675
Someone needs to teach him when
it's time to give up!

228
00:14:04,742 --> 00:14:08,775
Look, the seeds are finally
begining to take root.

229
00:14:08,875 --> 00:14:15,075
[Goku] Damnit! You'll both be
fertilizer before it takes
control of me!

230
00:14:15,175 --> 00:14:20,075
Various items are are often
brought here, to the temple as
religious offerings.

231
00:14:20,175 --> 00:14:24,675
One day, a small sapling was
delivered my a man in glasses.

232
00:14:24,775 --> 00:14:26,809
We planted it out in the yard,

233
00:14:26,909 --> 00:14:32,942
but we could see immediately
that this was no ordinary tree.

234
00:14:33,042 --> 00:14:36,709
It grew at such an alarming rate
that we feared the ninjinka

235
00:14:36,809 --> 00:14:40,375
was created by some form of
black magic.

236
00:14:40,475 --> 00:14:44,409
We tried to cut it down, but
blades could not scratch it,

237
00:14:44,509 --> 00:14:47,775
and its bark was impervious
to fire.

238
00:14:47,875 --> 00:14:52,575
Not knowing what else to do,
when the tree eventually
bore fruits,

239
00:14:52,675 --> 00:14:59,642
I forbid my pupils to eat them,
But Chinpu and Mingetsu
disobeyed me.

240
00:14:59,742 --> 00:15:02,742
Two clones were created,
and without knowing it,

241
00:15:02,842 --> 00:15:05,875
they served the fruit to
us, and we wound up here.

242
00:15:06,975 --> 00:15:08,542
[Mingetsu] Think you can
defeat us...

243
00:15:08,642 --> 00:15:10,275
[Chinpu] ...in your
current state?

244
00:15:10,375 --> 00:15:13,742
[Goku] Shut up! Will you please
stand still?!

245
00:15:13,842 --> 00:15:16,575
His movements have grown
quite sluggish.

246
00:15:16,675 --> 00:15:20,242
We might still have to wait
a while before he becomes
a bulb.

247
00:15:20,342 --> 00:15:22,542
It's time for the next step.

248
00:15:22,642 --> 00:15:25,042
Yes, we may have to use these.

249
00:15:25,142 --> 00:15:27,042
What are those? Weapons?!

250
00:15:27,142 --> 00:15:28,909
No, these are tools.

251
00:15:29,009 --> 00:15:30,209
A kingekishi...

252
00:15:30,309 --> 00:15:31,942
...and tanban.

253
00:15:32,042 --> 00:15:33,275
[Hakkai] Hold it a second.

254
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:36,742
Where did you say Mingetsu
and Chinpu come from?

255
00:15:36,842 --> 00:15:39,375
[Gosoukan] They are
ninjinka fruits.

256
00:15:39,475 --> 00:15:42,375
It steals people's genetic codes

257
00:15:42,475 --> 00:15:46,209
The grows an exact duplicate out
of their seeds.

258
00:15:46,309 --> 00:15:48,609
Identical replicas.

259
00:15:50,542 --> 00:15:53,175
They're clones.

260
00:15:53,275 --> 00:15:56,342
When Goku and Lirin tried to
pick those fruits they...

261
00:15:56,442 --> 00:16:00,542
It took a sample when they were
pricked by the ninjinka vines.

262
00:16:00,642 --> 00:16:05,009
[Sanzo] If that's the case, then
even he may havemet his match.

263
00:16:06,142 --> 00:16:07,409
[Goku] What?!

264
00:16:07,509 --> 00:16:09,642
[Chinpu] If we had allowed her
to fully ripen,

265
00:16:09,742 --> 00:16:12,375
she would have become conscious
like us.

266
00:16:17,542 --> 00:16:19,709
[Mingetsu] But her powers are
the same as the real thing!

267
00:16:19,809 --> 00:16:21,242
She should defeat you!

268
00:16:21,342 --> 00:16:25,275
Hey, lay off of me and let's
get to the real root of
the problem!

269
00:16:31,242 --> 00:16:32,342
Bitch!

270
00:16:38,542 --> 00:16:41,442
You're not nearly as cute as
the real one!

271
00:16:47,142 --> 00:16:48,309
Damn him!

272
00:16:48,409 --> 00:16:51,175
Let's see if he fights as well
against large numbers!

273
00:17:00,209 --> 00:17:02,675
Uh, this isn't good.

274
00:17:02,775 --> 00:17:05,675
[Chinpu] No one can be stronger
than themselves.

275
00:17:05,775 --> 00:17:08,975
[Mingetsu] Will you give up now
and become a pod-person?

276
00:17:13,742 --> 00:17:15,309
It's finally sprouted.

277
00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:17,409
Yes, let's seize him!

278
00:17:17,509 --> 00:17:18,575
[Sanzo] Stop!

279
00:17:22,775 --> 00:17:26,409
Sheesh, I thought one Goku was
bad enough.

280
00:17:26,509 --> 00:17:29,675
You should think of all the
trouble they'll cause
other folks.

281
00:17:29,775 --> 00:17:33,075
Besides, illegal copies are an
infringement of copyright.

282
00:17:33,175 --> 00:17:38,142
S-Sanzo... Gojyo... Hakkai...

283
00:17:38,275 --> 00:17:40,809
We knew you guys would come
back here for your friend.

284
00:17:40,909 --> 00:17:43,509
You saved us the trouble of
chasing after you.

285
00:17:43,609 --> 00:17:46,542
So these guys must be
Kougaiji's assassins?

286
00:17:46,642 --> 00:17:50,442
His own sister has become root
bait. I find that unlikely.

287
00:17:50,542 --> 00:17:54,642
In that case, then it's the
mastermind who's pulling all
of Kougaiji's strings.

288
00:17:54,742 --> 00:17:59,375
That makes sense. The twisted
personalities seem to point in
that direction.

289
00:17:59,475 --> 00:18:01,309
Ha! Useless babble.

290
00:18:01,409 --> 00:18:02,542
Kill at will.

291
00:18:04,242 --> 00:18:05,909
Now you're composte heap.

292
00:18:08,742 --> 00:18:12,975
Ha! I like this. Beating up
a gang of monkeys feels
pretty good!

293
00:18:13,075 --> 00:18:17,575
[Hakkai chuckles] I know it's
hard, but do try not to destroy
the original, will you?

294
00:18:19,309 --> 00:18:23,142
For some reason, it bothers me
they're having this much fun
defeating me!

295
00:18:23,242 --> 00:18:25,275
Just whose side are they
on anyway!

296
00:18:25,375 --> 00:18:26,942
[Mingetsu] What?!
[Chinpu] I don't understand!

297
00:18:27,042 --> 00:18:28,942
They should have the same
powers as Goku!

298
00:18:29,042 --> 00:18:32,609
Don't underestimate us. Goku may
be nutty but he ain't no fruit!

299
00:18:32,709 --> 00:18:35,475
The Goku we know is much
more daft!

300
00:18:39,842 --> 00:18:42,709
Next time you take a DNA sample
from Goku,

301
00:18:42,809 --> 00:18:45,975
you might want to make sure he's
not hungry first.

302
00:18:46,075 --> 00:18:50,342
They may hang from trees but
they sure make pathetic excuses
for monkeys.

303
00:18:52,075 --> 00:18:53,909
[Sanzo] Looks like you're out
of tricks.

304
00:18:56,709 --> 00:18:58,475
Now end this game.

305
00:18:58,575 --> 00:18:59,009
No!

306
00:18:59,109 --> 00:19:00,242
Don't shoot!

307
00:19:12,775 --> 00:19:16,542
What the hell? Why didn't you do
that from the very begining,

308
00:19:16,642 --> 00:19:18,675
instead of having to fight
them all?

309
00:19:18,809 --> 00:19:20,742
That wouldn't have
been satisfying.

310
00:19:20,842 --> 00:19:24,542
[Goku] What?
[Sanzo] For you, I mean.

311
00:19:24,642 --> 00:19:26,875
Now hurry up and finish the job.

312
00:19:27,909 --> 00:19:29,375
Listen up, ninjinka!

313
00:19:29,475 --> 00:19:32,709
You tasted like puke! Now you're
saw dust!

314
00:19:42,675 --> 00:19:43,809
Yes!

315
00:19:49,009 --> 00:19:51,609
[Gosoukan] We've been saved.

316
00:19:51,709 --> 00:19:52,909
Huh? Where am I?!

317
00:19:53,009 --> 00:19:56,742
And why is it snowing all
these crystals?

318
00:20:00,079 --> 00:20:02,420
[Gosoukan] We are
eternally grateful.

319
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:05,886
We shall be more wary of our
offerings from now on.

320
00:20:05,986 --> 00:20:07,853
[Chinpu] You have done so much
for us.

321
00:20:07,953 --> 00:20:10,386
[Mingetsu] How can we show you
our thanks?

322
00:20:10,486 --> 00:20:13,286
[Goku] You don't need to thank
us, but got any food?

323
00:20:14,586 --> 00:20:17,086
Perhaps this will meet
your approval.

324
00:20:18,553 --> 00:20:19,953
That'sll do.

325
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:21,820
Let's move.

326
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,053
Sure thing!

327
00:20:25,953 --> 00:20:27,720
[Goku] Hey, Sanzo.

328
00:20:27,853 --> 00:20:28,620
[Sanzo] What is it?

329
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:29,920
I'm sorry.

330
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:31,520
[Sanzo] Sorry? What for?

331
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:34,453
I'm sorry I'm such an idiot.

332
00:20:34,553 --> 00:20:37,986
[Sanzo] Don't let that bother
you. You're in good company.

333
00:20:38,086 --> 00:20:39,253
Got that right.

334
00:20:39,353 --> 00:20:40,953
We wouldn't be going on
this journey

335
00:20:41,053 --> 00:20:43,353
unless we were all a bunch
of idiots.

336
00:22:25,453 --> 00:22:28,153
[Goku] What the heck is up
with Gojyo?

337
00:22:28,253 --> 00:22:30,920
Why's he hanging around such a
little girl?

338
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:33,486
He sure is picking them young
these days.

339
00:22:33,586 --> 00:22:36,186
He seems like the type who
tends to look after people,

340
00:22:36,286 --> 00:22:39,720
then again maybe he's just
gotten himself into trouble.

341
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:43,086
So what else is new.
"Sweet Child of Mine."

342
00:22:43,186 --> 00:22:45,120
Next time on Saiyuki.
