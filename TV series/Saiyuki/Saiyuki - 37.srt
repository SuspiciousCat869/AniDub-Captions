1
00:01:36,394 --> 00:01:37,927
[Goku sneezes]

2
00:01:38,027 --> 00:01:39,555
[Goku] It's freezing out here.

3
00:01:39,555 --> 00:01:42,855
[Gojyo] Yeah, it's not
even snowing and I
swear I've got a cold.

4
00:01:42,955 --> 00:01:44,722
Is there some way to put
a roof on this thing?

5
00:01:44,822 --> 00:01:46,688
[Goku] I wish it was warmer...

6
00:01:46,788 --> 00:01:49,855
[Gojyo] Weren't you the one
complaining about it being
too hot a few days ago?

7
00:01:49,955 --> 00:01:53,188
[Goku] Yeah. So I can hate
the cold too, can't I?!

8
00:01:54,255 --> 00:01:57,288
Hey, Hakkai, when are we...

9
00:01:59,955 --> 00:02:00,722
Hakkai?

10
00:02:00,855 --> 00:02:03,955
Huh? Oh, sorry, don't worry.

11
00:02:04,055 --> 00:02:05,355
It's not that much further.

12
00:02:05,455 --> 00:02:09,455
See? Look Goku, it's
just over that next hill.

13
00:02:09,555 --> 00:02:12,088
[Goku] How do you know?
You been there before?

14
00:02:13,055 --> 00:02:14,922
Uh, well...

15
00:02:15,022 --> 00:02:19,055
[Goku] Ya have? What's it like?
Any good places to eat?

16
00:02:19,155 --> 00:02:21,288
There's not much to see.

17
00:02:26,822 --> 00:02:30,255
<i>[Hakkai] That's right.</i>
<i>It was always an empty place.</i>

18
00:02:36,455 --> 00:02:38,955
[Goku] "The Boy
Who Couldn't Smile".

19
00:02:47,122 --> 00:02:48,255
[Goku] Oh, man...

20
00:02:51,588 --> 00:02:53,455
[Sanzo] Looks like
the work of demons.

21
00:03:00,755 --> 00:03:02,988
This is... nasty.

22
00:03:03,088 --> 00:03:05,055
They didn't burn all the
restaurants, did they?

23
00:03:10,055 --> 00:03:11,722
[Hakkai] I'm sorry! I'll be
right back!

24
00:03:11,822 --> 00:03:12,955
[Gojyo] Hey, Hakkai!

25
00:03:22,422 --> 00:03:24,788
<i>[Hakkai] Let's see, right here.</i>

26
00:03:24,888 --> 00:03:27,022
<i>Around this corner,</i>
<i>about three blocks up.</i>

27
00:03:32,722 --> 00:03:37,522
[Bells chime]

28
00:03:49,255 --> 00:03:52,755
Ah, thank goodness. It's safe.

29
00:03:55,122 --> 00:03:56,755
Oh, hey guys.

30
00:03:56,855 --> 00:03:58,855
So what's up? Hakkai?

31
00:03:58,955 --> 00:04:01,688
It, uh, was nothing.

32
00:04:01,788 --> 00:04:04,655
[Woman] Gonou?
Is that you, Gonou?

33
00:04:04,755 --> 00:04:05,888
[All] Huh?

34
00:04:14,388 --> 00:04:16,522
[Hakkai] Oh my god... Shaohei!

35
00:04:16,622 --> 00:04:19,655
It really is you!
Oh my gosh, Gonou!

36
00:04:27,388 --> 00:04:32,255
[Goku] That lady called Hakkai,
Gonou. I wonder...

37
00:04:32,355 --> 00:04:35,488
That means they were school
mates or something.

38
00:04:35,588 --> 00:04:38,288
[Gojyo] You can be so
naive sometimes, Goku.

39
00:04:38,388 --> 00:04:40,222
They were a little
more than that.

40
00:04:40,322 --> 00:04:42,688
I think ol' one-eye was getting
some nun action, if you know-

41
00:04:42,788 --> 00:04:45,222
[Sanzo] ENOUGH!

42
00:04:45,322 --> 00:04:47,222
If you want something
to speculate about,

43
00:04:47,355 --> 00:04:50,388
why don't you figure out where
we're going to sleep tonight?!

44
00:04:50,488 --> 00:04:51,622
[Gojyo & Goku] Huh?

45
00:04:54,222 --> 00:04:56,122
[Hakkai] Aren't you
evacuating with them?

46
00:04:56,222 --> 00:04:59,088
[Shaohei] It's not like I
have any other place to go.

47
00:04:59,188 --> 00:05:02,822
I think I feel safer
here than any place else.

48
00:05:02,922 --> 00:05:07,355
[Hakkai] This is such a
surprise. I never thought I'd
see you wearing a nun's hat.

49
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:09,955
[Shaohei] I left the orphanage
soon after you did.

50
00:05:10,055 --> 00:05:12,322
But I couldn't stay
away for long.

51
00:05:12,422 --> 00:05:15,622
You know, I never could bring
myself to leave this place.

52
00:05:15,722 --> 00:05:17,055
How come?

53
00:05:17,155 --> 00:05:19,355
I couldn't find myself a man.

54
00:05:20,588 --> 00:05:21,922
Huh?

55
00:05:22,022 --> 00:05:24,922
[Shaohei] Just kidding!
Sister asked me back.

56
00:05:25,022 --> 00:05:28,322
And I like children.
So I guess the habit stuck.

57
00:05:28,422 --> 00:05:31,555
Taking care of others was
always important to you.

58
00:05:31,655 --> 00:05:32,788
Your strong suit.

59
00:05:34,388 --> 00:05:36,288
A smile...

60
00:05:36,388 --> 00:05:39,055
You have changed, Gonou.

61
00:05:39,155 --> 00:05:41,788
Yes, I suppose so.

62
00:05:41,888 --> 00:05:43,822
I like you better this way.

63
00:05:43,922 --> 00:05:45,688
[Hakkai] Oh?
[Shaohei] Yeah.

64
00:05:45,788 --> 00:05:48,755
Don't you remember how
you were as a little boy?

65
00:05:48,855 --> 00:05:51,855
You were just so... so sullen.

66
00:05:51,955 --> 00:05:54,688
Yes, I remember that very well.

67
00:05:55,622 --> 00:05:57,755
[Children laughing and playing]

68
00:06:08,122 --> 00:06:10,955
[Kid Shaohei] Please let someone
else go on safety patrol!

69
00:06:11,055 --> 00:06:14,488
[Sister] What is it? This
isn't like you, Shaohei.

70
00:06:14,588 --> 00:06:18,155
[Kid Shaohei] I don't like
being on duty with Gonou.

71
00:06:18,255 --> 00:06:21,522
Why not? He's a smart
boy, just quiet.

72
00:06:21,622 --> 00:06:25,155
He's scary! I don't... like him.

73
00:06:25,255 --> 00:06:27,188
I've never seen him smile.

74
00:06:29,788 --> 00:06:31,722
Now you listen to me.

75
00:06:31,822 --> 00:06:35,255
I don't want to ever hear you
say such things like that.

76
00:06:41,655 --> 00:06:42,822
[Sister] Gonou...

77
00:06:43,822 --> 00:06:45,455
Let's have a talk.

78
00:06:47,955 --> 00:06:52,122
A number of schools have been
asking for you to apply.

79
00:06:52,222 --> 00:06:54,988
I know you'll do
well academically,

80
00:06:55,088 --> 00:06:59,355
but... can you handle
being away from here?

81
00:06:59,455 --> 00:07:03,922
Love those around you, and
God will watch over you.

82
00:07:04,022 --> 00:07:07,822
But if you close off your
heart as you do now...

83
00:07:07,922 --> 00:07:10,022
[Gonou] If God really exists,

84
00:07:10,122 --> 00:07:11,255
he is a fool.

85
00:07:14,255 --> 00:07:15,688
[Sister] Gonou...

86
00:07:15,788 --> 00:07:17,855
You must want to be loved.

87
00:07:17,955 --> 00:07:19,222
Poor child.

88
00:07:25,722 --> 00:07:29,455
[Kid Shaohei] Hey, why
don't you smile, Gonou?

89
00:07:32,488 --> 00:07:35,422
Question is, why
do you choose to?

90
00:07:43,955 --> 00:07:47,122
[Shaohei] Do you remember?
Do you remember that day?

91
00:07:47,222 --> 00:07:48,355
[Hakkai] Yes...

92
00:07:48,455 --> 00:07:51,155
What on Earth was going
through your mind back then?

93
00:07:51,255 --> 00:07:55,155
Why? What's the point in asking
that now? It's the past.

94
00:07:55,255 --> 00:07:59,688
Another boy... has said
that very same thing to me.

95
00:07:59,788 --> 00:08:00,722
Huh?

96
00:08:00,822 --> 00:08:02,188
[Man 1] Hey, bring
that pier over here.

97
00:08:02,288 --> 00:08:03,855
[Man 2] Gotta go up straight.
A little more to the right.

98
00:08:03,955 --> 00:08:05,122
[The men carry on
their construction]

99
00:08:05,222 --> 00:08:07,022
[Gojyo] What are you gawking at?
[Goku] Hmm?

100
00:08:07,122 --> 00:08:08,822
What's that? Over there.

101
00:08:08,922 --> 00:08:12,555
It's called working. You
should try it sometime, huh?

102
00:08:12,655 --> 00:08:15,455
Not that! I mean
those stone things!

103
00:08:18,622 --> 00:08:20,288
They're statues.

104
00:08:22,022 --> 00:08:26,488
Hey buddy, what's the story with
those little cement ladies?

105
00:08:26,588 --> 00:08:28,255
What? Those things? Oh, those

106
00:08:28,355 --> 00:08:31,488
are those are goddess statues
everybody's talking about.

107
00:08:31,588 --> 00:08:33,722
You see, we put them
there to protect us.

108
00:08:33,822 --> 00:08:36,755
They're suppose to be imbued
with some kind of holy power
that subdues demons.

109
00:08:38,122 --> 00:08:40,788
I hear they're planning to put
them around the entire city.

110
00:08:44,322 --> 00:08:48,155
Oooh. How do... you
turn these things on?

111
00:08:48,255 --> 00:08:51,455
They don't appear to be
working so well on us.

112
00:08:51,555 --> 00:08:53,922
Hmph. I'm sure they'll
provide them with some
comfort. Let's go.

113
00:08:56,022 --> 00:08:57,155
Hey! Wait up!

114
00:08:58,755 --> 00:09:02,455
[Sister] My... how you've grown!

115
00:09:02,555 --> 00:09:06,122
[Hakkai] With all the
kids you've helped, I'm
surprised you remember me.

116
00:09:07,455 --> 00:09:10,188
I remember all of them, Gonou.

117
00:09:10,488 --> 00:09:11,988
Yes.

118
00:09:12,088 --> 00:09:13,788
Will you be staying?

119
00:09:13,888 --> 00:09:18,355
Not long. I'm just on my way
west with some friends of mine.

120
00:09:18,455 --> 00:09:22,955
[Sister] Surely you can
stay and have a cup of
tea with us, can't you?

121
00:09:23,055 --> 00:09:25,455
[Hakkai] I think I can
spare the time for that.

122
00:09:26,155 --> 00:09:27,522
Come on, Sister!

123
00:09:27,622 --> 00:09:31,422
Hurry, hurry! You said you were
gonna draw pictures with us!

124
00:09:31,522 --> 00:09:32,788
Yes, children.

125
00:09:32,888 --> 00:09:36,755
You don't mind. I'll
join you in just a moment.

126
00:09:36,855 --> 00:09:37,988
Sure.

127
00:09:39,022 --> 00:09:42,522
It is good tea,
so you be waiting.

128
00:09:42,622 --> 00:09:43,755
'Kay.

129
00:09:44,588 --> 00:09:46,422
[Door shuts]

130
00:09:46,522 --> 00:09:49,588
She hasn't changed...
all this time.

131
00:09:51,488 --> 00:09:55,422
By the way, where can I
find that boy you were
talking to me about?

132
00:09:55,522 --> 00:09:57,955
Yes, I'll take you
to where he is.

133
00:10:24,076 --> 00:10:25,397
[Hakkai] You must be Linchei.

134
00:10:25,397 --> 00:10:27,530
How are you?

135
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:30,264
[Linchei] I don't know
what Sister told you,

136
00:10:30,364 --> 00:10:32,464
but you're wasting your time.

137
00:10:34,297 --> 00:10:36,930
I will never believe in God.

138
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:41,897
Is that so? I've had my
share of problems with
Gods too, believe me.

139
00:10:50,264 --> 00:10:53,764
[Hakkai] You know, I spent
some time here myself.

140
00:10:53,864 --> 00:10:58,130
And like you, I always felt
out of place. Disjointed.

141
00:10:58,264 --> 00:11:02,097
It seems no one else shared my
frustrations with the world.

142
00:11:02,197 --> 00:11:07,830
I look into your eyes, Linchei,
and I see myself as a child.

143
00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:09,964
No one's like me.

144
00:11:10,064 --> 00:11:12,164
[Hakkai] Always hating
everyone's refusal to

145
00:11:12,264 --> 00:11:15,097
see the ugliness in
front of their faces.

146
00:11:15,197 --> 00:11:20,264
The Sisters' charity that barely
conceals their true hypocrisy.

147
00:11:20,364 --> 00:11:24,830
And then there's all the
other children, who harbor
no doubts whatsoever.

148
00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:28,730
But most of all, yourself,
for having to depend
on their charity.

149
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:31,264
The kindness of strangers.

150
00:11:31,397 --> 00:11:34,597
Sometimes, you wish
it all would just...

151
00:11:34,697 --> 00:11:37,797
fall into ruin, don't you?

152
00:11:37,897 --> 00:11:42,130
I understand why you
are so self destructive.

153
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:46,330
Everyone who comes here has
some source of unhappiness.

154
00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:48,664
[Hakkai] But...
[Linchie] But?

155
00:11:48,764 --> 00:11:50,930
You make me sick!
You're just like them!

156
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:52,597
You're as bad as the Sisters!

157
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:55,197
Listen to me. Linchei.

158
00:11:55,297 --> 00:11:58,130
You shut up! You let
them brainwash you!

159
00:11:58,230 --> 00:11:59,297
Linchei!

160
00:11:59,397 --> 00:12:00,797
I hate them all.

161
00:12:00,897 --> 00:12:04,197
The town, the Sisters...
I want them gone.

162
00:12:04,330 --> 00:12:08,764
And even if they were gone,
it would not make the world
what you want it to be.

163
00:12:08,864 --> 00:12:11,264
Anything is better
than this world!

164
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:17,164
Huh?

165
00:12:18,297 --> 00:12:19,397
Gonou...

166
00:12:19,497 --> 00:12:21,130
Shaohei...

167
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:25,264
[Hakkai] So you were
listening the whole time?

168
00:12:25,364 --> 00:12:28,097
[Shaohei] I'm-I'm sorry.

169
00:12:28,197 --> 00:12:31,397
[Hakkai] It's all right.
It makes us even now.

170
00:12:31,497 --> 00:12:32,797
[Shaohei] Even?

171
00:12:32,897 --> 00:12:34,130
[Hakkai] Nothing.

172
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:35,330
Talking to myself.

173
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:37,797
Uh, Gonou...

174
00:12:37,897 --> 00:12:38,497
[Hakkai] Yes?

175
00:12:38,597 --> 00:12:39,697
Is that what...

176
00:12:39,797 --> 00:12:41,497
you used to think back then?

177
00:12:44,464 --> 00:12:47,964
Well, I suppose so,
but in a general way.

178
00:12:48,064 --> 00:12:50,630
I think that this case is...

179
00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:52,897
very, very different somehow.

180
00:12:52,997 --> 00:12:54,064
Then what should I do?

181
00:12:54,164 --> 00:12:56,064
Please show me how
to help him, Gonou.

182
00:12:56,164 --> 00:13:00,697
So he can learn... how to
smile again. As you have.

183
00:13:08,297 --> 00:13:10,197
[Hakkai] I'm not sure
what to tell you.

184
00:13:10,297 --> 00:13:13,297
[Shaohei] Please try.
I have to save him.

185
00:13:13,397 --> 00:13:17,130
You have to be sincere
in your motives.

186
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:21,464
[Shaohei] What?
[Hakkai] You must approach
him with an honest heart.

187
00:13:21,564 --> 00:13:23,797
That's all I can
tell you, Shaohei.

188
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:29,530
Don't worry, I'm sure we can
figure something out together.

189
00:13:31,130 --> 00:13:32,764
I hope so.

190
00:13:34,997 --> 00:13:36,830
[Goku] Hakkai! Where ya been?

191
00:13:37,597 --> 00:13:38,930
[Hakkai] Sorry I'm late.

192
00:13:39,997 --> 00:13:42,830
So, finished your business?

193
00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:44,830
Yes, for today.

194
00:13:44,930 --> 00:13:46,997
[Sanzo] I see.

195
00:13:47,097 --> 00:13:50,697
<i>[Hakkai] Strange. I wonder</i>
<i>why Sanzo looks so concerned.</i>

196
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:53,297
So! Shall we eat then?

197
00:13:53,397 --> 00:13:56,597
You bet! How did you
know I was hungry?

198
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:16,897
<i>[Linchie] I just wanted</i>
<i>to meet someone.</i>

199
00:14:18,064 --> 00:14:19,664
<i>Someone I could open up to.</i>

200
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:25,697
<i>But... they all have no faces.</i>

201
00:14:31,264 --> 00:14:32,964
<i>I'm all alone.</i>

202
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:41,164
[Linchie] Snow...

203
00:14:46,330 --> 00:14:48,530
[Goku] Boy, am I stuffed!

204
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:49,797
[Shaohei] Gonou!

205
00:14:49,897 --> 00:14:51,030
[Goky & Gojyo] Huh?

206
00:14:51,497 --> 00:14:53,164
Shaohei!

207
00:14:53,264 --> 00:14:55,064
Disappeared?!

208
00:14:55,164 --> 00:14:58,464
[Shaohei] I checked all
the rooms, but he's not
at the orphanage.

209
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:00,664
[Hakkai] You have no
idea where he could be?

210
00:15:02,530 --> 00:15:06,130
Listen. Wait for me at
the church. I promise you,

211
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:07,864
I will find Linchei.

212
00:15:07,964 --> 00:15:08,830
But I...

213
00:15:08,930 --> 00:15:11,597
I know. But please
leave this to me.

214
00:15:24,097 --> 00:15:25,230
Huh?

215
00:15:39,064 --> 00:15:40,430
[Hakkai] That won't
solve anything.

216
00:15:42,497 --> 00:15:47,130
Destroying what you hate,
will not create the world
you long for. I promise.

217
00:15:48,064 --> 00:15:49,964
The world I long for?!

218
00:15:50,064 --> 00:15:53,197
The world I want
is a waste land!

219
00:15:53,297 --> 00:15:56,997
[Hakkai] Having demons destroy
this town is not hypocritical?

220
00:15:59,564 --> 00:16:02,330
Let me tell you something,
Linchei. This is not the way.

221
00:16:04,264 --> 00:16:07,097
If you want to do something,
don't weaken others,

222
00:16:07,197 --> 00:16:08,797
but strengthen yourself.

223
00:16:08,897 --> 00:16:10,464
[Linchie] Leave me alone!

224
00:16:10,564 --> 00:16:12,064
I can't keep living like this...

225
00:16:12,164 --> 00:16:13,097
I just can't!

226
00:16:13,197 --> 00:16:15,664
If you really wanna
die, then die.

227
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:21,997
Don't add to the hypocrisy
and misery of the world
with your own selfishness.

228
00:16:23,230 --> 00:16:27,264
[Linchie] Shut up.
Shut up. Shut up!

229
00:16:27,364 --> 00:16:28,497
SHUT UP!

230
00:16:41,545 --> 00:16:42,778
[Hakkai] Do you feel better now?

231
00:16:50,112 --> 00:16:54,378
Lookie here. It seems the demons
have been waiting for that.

232
00:16:55,645 --> 00:16:57,378
Now where are you going?

233
00:16:58,378 --> 00:17:00,078
You got your wish.

234
00:17:03,612 --> 00:17:05,912
Hey, thanks a lot
for the help, kid.

235
00:17:06,012 --> 00:17:08,378
Those stupid statues
sure gave us trouble.

236
00:17:08,478 --> 00:17:10,345
Now this town's gonna burn!

237
00:17:13,478 --> 00:17:16,978
I'm going to assume you're quite
terrified right about now.

238
00:17:18,245 --> 00:17:21,045
Feel it? You feel how
powerless you are?

239
00:17:24,945 --> 00:17:26,912
Then grow stronger.

240
00:17:27,012 --> 00:17:31,178
Stop sulking about it, you
big baby, and grow stronger!

241
00:17:31,878 --> 00:17:33,512
Stronger...

242
00:17:33,612 --> 00:17:38,512
Boy, you may have helped us,
but we'll still kill you,
all the same!

243
00:17:38,612 --> 00:17:40,745
[Hakkai] I'm sorry, could
you guys hold on a minute.

244
00:17:43,245 --> 00:17:46,312
What? Why you... I... Attack!

245
00:17:46,412 --> 00:17:48,545
[Demons give battle cries]

246
00:17:53,612 --> 00:17:54,978
Do you see now?

247
00:17:55,078 --> 00:17:58,212
Facing your own death is
not such a simple matter.

248
00:18:02,012 --> 00:18:03,812
Alrighty, that's it then.

249
00:18:03,912 --> 00:18:05,912
Guess I'll handle
this one on my own.

250
00:18:19,112 --> 00:18:21,578
This is getting exhausting.
How many of these
guys are there?

251
00:18:21,678 --> 00:18:23,478
[Linchie screams]
[Hakkai] Linchie!

252
00:18:23,578 --> 00:18:28,678
Hehehehe, at least I'll take you
to Hell with me before I die.

253
00:18:35,878 --> 00:18:37,478
[Shaohei] Get back!

254
00:18:37,578 --> 00:18:38,578
[Hakkai] Shaohei!

255
00:18:38,678 --> 00:18:39,812
[Linchie] Sister?

256
00:18:46,812 --> 00:18:48,478
Gojyo! About time.

257
00:18:50,778 --> 00:18:55,078
Well I'll be. I go out
for a little night air,

258
00:18:55,178 --> 00:18:57,945
and low and behold, look
what I stumble across.

259
00:18:58,045 --> 00:19:00,112
I just wanted to go for a snack.

260
00:19:00,212 --> 00:19:01,845
I went for a smoke.

261
00:19:09,512 --> 00:19:11,278
Sister...

262
00:19:12,712 --> 00:19:14,278
Well then, shall we?

263
00:19:14,378 --> 00:19:16,678
Let's get this thing
over with, okay?

264
00:19:17,612 --> 00:19:18,745
Right on!

265
00:19:30,112 --> 00:19:33,412
[Hakkai] I'm sorry. I'm sorry
if I put any of you in danger.

266
00:19:33,512 --> 00:19:38,645
[Shaohei] I've never heard of
anyone apologizing for saving
an entire town before.

267
00:19:38,745 --> 00:19:41,312
[Hakkai] Yes, but I
shouldn't have had to.

268
00:19:41,412 --> 00:19:44,112
Gonou, you've done so much.

269
00:19:44,212 --> 00:19:45,512
[Hakkai] All the same.

270
00:19:45,612 --> 00:19:47,412
But what about the boy?

271
00:19:47,512 --> 00:19:53,312
He'll be just fine. If he has
you around, I'm sure he'll
learn to smile once more.

272
00:19:53,412 --> 00:19:54,545
[Shaohei] I hope so...

273
00:19:55,845 --> 00:19:57,912
[Hakkai] Have faith.

274
00:19:58,012 --> 00:20:00,878
What you did last night
was utterly sincere.

275
00:20:00,978 --> 00:20:05,012
And I know... I know Linchei can
see that it was too, Shaohei.

276
00:20:05,845 --> 00:20:06,978
You do?

277
00:20:08,412 --> 00:20:09,912
[Hakkai] Take good
care of him for me.

278
00:20:10,012 --> 00:20:11,645
[Shaohei] I will.

279
00:20:13,445 --> 00:20:15,978
That's some snow we had, eh?

280
00:20:16,078 --> 00:20:20,045
And by the way, I just thought
I'd mention to you that...

281
00:20:20,145 --> 00:20:21,978
I changed my name.

282
00:20:22,078 --> 00:20:24,278
I'm no longer called Cho Gonou.

283
00:20:25,045 --> 00:20:26,745
I am Cho Hakkai.

284
00:20:37,212 --> 00:20:38,945
Thanks, Hakkai.
