1
00:01:40,647 --> 00:01:43,868
I'm starving.
When can we stop to eat?

2
00:01:43,868 --> 00:01:46,735
Is that all you ever say,
you stupid monkey?!

3
00:01:46,835 --> 00:01:49,102
And is that all you ever say?

4
00:01:49,202 --> 00:01:51,702
Oh, dear god. Here we go again.

5
00:01:51,802 --> 00:01:52,935
[Hakkai gasps in surprise]

6
00:01:54,568 --> 00:01:56,168
What'd you do that for?

7
00:01:56,268 --> 00:01:59,402
There are better ways to break
up the monotony, you know.

8
00:01:59,502 --> 00:02:01,068
[Hakkai] I didn't have to.

9
00:02:01,168 --> 00:02:02,302
[Gojyo & Goku] Huh?

10
00:02:07,602 --> 00:02:09,068
[Gojyo] Come to think of it...

11
00:02:09,168 --> 00:02:12,302
Cleaning up after demons
is one of our routines.

12
00:02:12,402 --> 00:02:14,035
I don't think demons
could do all this.

13
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:17,802
[Goku] What a senseless
thing to do...

14
00:02:17,902 --> 00:02:20,068
I know. Shouldn't there
be more corpses?

15
00:02:20,168 --> 00:02:21,235
Yeah.

16
00:02:21,335 --> 00:02:22,835
[Goku yells]

17
00:02:22,935 --> 00:02:23,602
What now?

18
00:02:23,702 --> 00:02:24,902
Is he alive?

19
00:02:27,935 --> 00:02:29,168
Just barely.

20
00:02:29,268 --> 00:02:33,168
Our... our caravan was
ambushed by demons.

21
00:02:34,135 --> 00:02:35,602
[Goku] Huh?

22
00:02:35,702 --> 00:02:38,435
You must... help me save them.

23
00:02:38,535 --> 00:02:41,035
<i>[Sanzo] Another distraction</i>
<i>I don't need.</i>

24
00:02:45,435 --> 00:02:47,035
[Goku] "The second son".

25
00:02:54,702 --> 00:02:58,102
[Zenon] Surely a Founding
Scripture did not end up there.

26
00:02:59,468 --> 00:03:02,435
[Shien] I would not put too
much stock in this rumor.

27
00:03:03,968 --> 00:03:06,168
[Zenon] It's idle chatter
overheard from demons.

28
00:03:06,268 --> 00:03:08,868
[Homura] How likely
is it, Shien?

29
00:03:08,968 --> 00:03:12,735
I'd say it's about as likely
as winning the lottery.

30
00:03:12,835 --> 00:03:14,435
But we coud take a look.

31
00:03:15,268 --> 00:03:16,902
That bad, huh?

32
00:03:18,968 --> 00:03:20,002
[Zenon] What the hell?

33
00:03:20,102 --> 00:03:22,102
It's not like I've got
something better to do.

34
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:23,702
[Shien] Zenon?

35
00:03:23,802 --> 00:03:26,635
[Zenon] You can't win
if you don't play, right?

36
00:03:26,735 --> 00:03:31,168
If I hit the jackpot, I expect
you to throw me a big party.

37
00:03:31,268 --> 00:03:32,468
<i>[Shien] Honestly.</i>

38
00:03:46,502 --> 00:03:48,135
So this is it.

39
00:03:48,935 --> 00:03:50,168
<i>I'll be...</i>

40
00:03:54,502 --> 00:03:57,668
[Demons yelling and
villagers panicking]

41
00:04:00,968 --> 00:04:06,035
[Demon laughs deviously]

42
00:04:06,135 --> 00:04:08,768
[Demon 1] What the-?!
[Bald demon] Whoever did that
better come out right now!

43
00:04:11,735 --> 00:04:16,268
Sorry, ladies. But I
can't have you torchin'
up the whole place, now can I?

44
00:04:19,268 --> 00:04:20,402
[Bald demon yells]

45
00:04:21,435 --> 00:04:22,568
[Demon yells]

46
00:04:23,302 --> 00:04:25,202
Ah! A banishing rifle...

47
00:04:25,302 --> 00:04:26,868
I'm outta here!

48
00:04:26,968 --> 00:04:29,135
[Demons panic as
they try to leave]

49
00:04:36,968 --> 00:04:38,502
[Demons yell]

50
00:04:38,602 --> 00:04:42,168
Come on guys, that's no
way to greet visitors.

51
00:04:42,268 --> 00:04:44,102
You could at least say "hello".

52
00:04:44,202 --> 00:04:45,668
You get out of our way!

53
00:04:45,768 --> 00:04:47,968
[Gojyo] We don't like
to move around too much.

54
00:04:48,068 --> 00:04:50,502
[Goku] Yeah. Too much effort.

55
00:04:50,602 --> 00:04:52,068
[Demons shout in frustration]

56
00:04:52,168 --> 00:04:53,768
I give up!

57
00:04:53,868 --> 00:04:56,002
[Demons panicking]

58
00:04:57,135 --> 00:04:58,802
Hey! Come back here!

59
00:04:58,902 --> 00:05:00,202
Hold up, Goku.

60
00:05:00,635 --> 00:05:01,768
Hm?

61
00:05:06,168 --> 00:05:07,502
Whattya know...

62
00:05:07,602 --> 00:05:09,102
Why, you're Zenon.

63
00:05:09,202 --> 00:05:11,435
So these guys are your minions?

64
00:05:12,268 --> 00:05:13,435
[Dense demon] YAH!

65
00:05:13,535 --> 00:05:14,935
[Dense demon yells]

66
00:05:15,035 --> 00:05:17,035
Guess I spoke too soon.

67
00:05:17,135 --> 00:05:20,568
[Zenon] You guys heard about
the Scripture too, eh?

68
00:05:20,702 --> 00:05:22,535
[Gojyo] What?
[An old women yells]

69
00:05:22,635 --> 00:05:25,335
[Goku] Huh?
[Old Lady] Oh Shunei!
Please don't hurt him!

70
00:05:30,002 --> 00:05:34,435
Hand over your money.
And I'll take whatever
food you got layin' around.

71
00:05:35,468 --> 00:05:38,135
Don't come any closer
or the kid gets it!

72
00:05:38,235 --> 00:05:40,835
First you pillage,
then on to hostages.

73
00:05:40,935 --> 00:05:43,135
You losers are all the same.

74
00:05:43,235 --> 00:05:45,535
Should I take care of this?

75
00:05:45,635 --> 00:05:48,968
[Zenon] I don't think
that's a wise idea.

76
00:05:49,068 --> 00:05:52,302
Better leave this one to me.
Hmph.

77
00:05:52,402 --> 00:05:54,768
What...? You arrogant...!

78
00:05:54,868 --> 00:05:56,668
Why should YOU get to save him?

79
00:05:56,768 --> 00:05:59,535
[Zenon] Because you'll just
get the hostage killed.

80
00:05:59,635 --> 00:06:01,835
[Demon] I told you not
to come any closer!

81
00:06:01,935 --> 00:06:04,768
Is that right?! Well
we'll just see about that!

82
00:06:08,068 --> 00:06:10,302
[Demon shouts in surprise]
[Zenon] Get down, kid!

83
00:06:13,135 --> 00:06:14,268
[Demon yells]

84
00:06:15,968 --> 00:06:19,268
He's right. You would
have killed him with
a shot like that.

85
00:06:19,368 --> 00:06:21,435
We planned it that way,
you moron!

86
00:06:22,735 --> 00:06:23,868
[Zenon] Can you stand?

87
00:06:29,368 --> 00:06:30,702
You bet!

88
00:06:30,802 --> 00:06:32,935
[Owl hooting]

89
00:06:36,968 --> 00:06:39,135
I'm afraid we don't
have much to offer,

90
00:06:39,235 --> 00:06:41,735
but please make
yourselves at home.

91
00:06:42,202 --> 00:06:44,268
Let's dig in!

92
00:06:44,368 --> 00:06:49,335
So, what is one of Homura's
henchmen doing around
these parts?

93
00:06:49,435 --> 00:06:53,768
It seemed like a nice place
to get some fresh air.

94
00:06:53,868 --> 00:06:57,135
Really? Because I thought
you said something
about a Scripture.

95
00:06:58,268 --> 00:07:01,635
I don't recall that.
Are you sure?

96
00:07:04,102 --> 00:07:06,102
And what brings you here?

97
00:07:06,202 --> 00:07:08,468
I didn't think the four of
you could bear to be outside

98
00:07:08,568 --> 00:07:10,702
the presence of each
other's company.

99
00:07:10,802 --> 00:07:13,502
You think we'd be together
if we didn't have to be?

100
00:07:17,868 --> 00:07:20,368
[Gojyo] So, Sanzo and Hakkai
said they'd catch up as soon

101
00:07:20,468 --> 00:07:22,568
as they dropped the
guy off at a doctor.

102
00:07:22,668 --> 00:07:27,168
I expect they'll show up
sometime tomorrow if they
don't do any sightseeing.

103
00:07:27,268 --> 00:07:29,835
So, you think demons
are responsible?

104
00:07:29,935 --> 00:07:34,835
It's not really their style.
You didn't have anything to
do with this, did you?

105
00:07:34,935 --> 00:07:37,068
Give me some credit now,
will ya?

106
00:07:37,168 --> 00:07:40,602
Okay then, maybe Gyumaoh's
side is behind it.

107
00:07:40,702 --> 00:07:43,835
So does that mean we should
put off our own showdown?

108
00:07:46,002 --> 00:07:47,268
[Goku] More please!

109
00:07:47,368 --> 00:07:49,768
Augh! You've ruined my
big, dramatic pause!

110
00:07:49,868 --> 00:07:51,002
Hm?

111
00:07:52,935 --> 00:07:54,068
It's right this way.

112
00:07:58,135 --> 00:08:01,368
If there's anything at all
you need, just let me know.

113
00:08:01,468 --> 00:08:04,935
Hey, you're that little kid that
was taken hostage, aren't you?

114
00:08:05,035 --> 00:08:06,835
Thank you so much for saving me.

115
00:08:06,935 --> 00:08:09,968
That mean ol' demon would
have killed me for sure.

116
00:08:11,535 --> 00:08:14,402
<i>[Zenon] My son would have</i>
<i>been about this age now.</i>

117

118
00:08:20,468 --> 00:08:23,502
Hello? Is there
something you want?

119
00:08:23,602 --> 00:08:27,235
Huh? Sorry... No thanks.
I'm fine.

00:08:47,102 --> 00:08:49,235
[Man 1] This one!
[Man 2] Ack! You
dropped it on my foot.

123
00:08:49,335 --> 00:08:50,502
[Man 3] Hey, tell him
to give me a hand!

[Villager] No, I can't say
that I have, but, ah,

125
00:08:55,568 --> 00:08:58,468
can I interest you in some
calligraphy scrolls?

126
00:08:58,568 --> 00:09:00,468
That's alright. So long.

127

129
00:09:09,968 --> 00:09:12,335
[Jerk kid 1] What's the
matter, Shunei? You fall?

130
00:09:12,435 --> 00:09:14,735
You should watch
where you're going!

131
00:09:14,868 --> 00:09:17,968
Yeah, then maybe we wouldn't
knock you down so much!

132
00:09:21,435 --> 00:09:22,568
[Zenon] What a mess.

133
00:09:28,668 --> 00:09:31,835
[Zenon] You sure must like
getting pushed around like that.

134
00:09:31,935 --> 00:09:33,835
[Shunei] What makes
you say that?

135
00:09:33,935 --> 00:09:37,502
Because you don't do
anything about it.

136
00:09:37,602 --> 00:09:42,668
I don't see any point.
I could never beat up those
bunch of jerks anyway.

137
00:09:42,768 --> 00:09:46,035
Then you've lost
before you started.

138
00:09:46,135 --> 00:09:50,702
If I were your father,
I'd beat you up for not
standing up to those kids.

139
00:09:50,802 --> 00:09:55,735
Well, so you live at that
inn with your grandparents,
is that right?

140
00:09:55,835 --> 00:09:59,035
[Shunei] Mmhmm.
[Zenon] What happened
to your parents?

141
00:10:00,968 --> 00:10:03,935
I'm an orphan.
Demons killed them.

142
00:10:05,835 --> 00:10:10,435
They're both gone, because
those damn demons keep coming.

143
00:10:10,535 --> 00:10:14,335
Each time they come and each
time more people are killed.

It's her fault for
not listening to me!

You will pay for
what you have done!

You would never kill me,
would you?

154
00:10:38,968 --> 00:10:41,668
Gods are forbidden
to take a life.

00:10:43,468 --> 00:10:45,335
[Zenon] An illusion?!
[Souei chuckles]

157
00:10:45,435 --> 00:10:49,135
[Souei] Kind of hard to
catch me when I'm not
even here, isn't it?

158
00:10:49,235 --> 00:10:52,168
I wish you the best, Zenon.
Farewell.

159
00:11:11,396 --> 00:11:14,196
[Zenon] Now... come at me.

160
00:11:14,296 --> 00:11:19,763
Don't hold back. You just try to
imagine that I'm the demon who
killed your parents.

161
00:11:21,196 --> 00:11:22,329
[Shunei gives a battlecry]

162
00:11:27,463 --> 00:11:29,363
Come on now, try harder.

163
00:11:29,463 --> 00:11:31,729
You won't stop those
bullies with that swing.

164
00:11:33,163 --> 00:11:35,029
[Wood clanking
against metal loudly]

165
00:11:35,129 --> 00:11:38,296
Who the hell would be making
a racket this early?

166
00:11:38,396 --> 00:11:40,396
It's noon already, moron.

167
00:11:40,496 --> 00:11:43,029
[Goku] You mean...
I missed breakfast?!

168
00:11:45,329 --> 00:11:48,163
I wouldn't of guessed
he liked kids.

169
00:11:48,263 --> 00:11:51,196
[Goku] Huh?
[Gojyo] Nothing,
let's get lunch!

170
00:11:52,629 --> 00:11:53,763
[Goku] Yeah!

171
00:11:54,429 --> 00:11:56,263
[Shunei breathes heavily]

172
00:11:56,363 --> 00:11:58,729
You're starting to
get the hang of it.

173
00:11:58,829 --> 00:12:02,029
It won't be too long before
you're takin' on demons.

174
00:12:03,629 --> 00:12:04,763
Hm!

175
00:12:07,563 --> 00:12:10,129
There's not much of
a village left.

176
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:13,463
You might have to move some
place else pretty soon, kid.

177
00:12:14,196 --> 00:12:16,796
We can't leave this place.

178
00:12:16,896 --> 00:12:19,429
I once overheard
my dad say that.

179
00:12:19,529 --> 00:12:22,996
He said there's something
in the village that we
have to protect.

180
00:12:23,096 --> 00:12:26,429
[Zenon] Huh?
[Shunei] It's a magical
treasure that must be kept

181
00:12:26,529 --> 00:12:29,063
from falling into
the wrong hands.

182
00:12:29,163 --> 00:12:32,029
My dad showed it to me
once before he died.

183
00:12:33,029 --> 00:12:35,029
So this magic treasure...

184
00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:38,296
wouldn't happen to be a
certain scroll, would it?

185
00:12:38,396 --> 00:12:40,929
[Shunei] Uh, yeah.
How did you know?

186
00:12:41,029 --> 00:12:43,696
I believe I just
hit the jackpot.

187
00:12:48,163 --> 00:12:49,563
[Goku] Can I have some more?

188
00:12:49,663 --> 00:12:51,329
Oh, of course you can!

189
00:12:51,429 --> 00:12:53,263
Don't be such a pig, you pig.

190
00:12:53,363 --> 00:12:55,696
[Goku] I can't help it
I didn't have breakfast!

191
00:12:55,796 --> 00:12:59,629
You're one to talk, drinking all
their wine in the middle of the
afternoon, you big lush.

192
00:12:59,729 --> 00:13:03,696
Hey, I have to make up for
lost time before those
two prudes get here.

193
00:13:03,796 --> 00:13:05,929
Get off my back.

194
00:13:06,029 --> 00:13:10,329
[Hakkai] We came all this way
and still couldn't save him.

195
00:13:10,429 --> 00:13:12,396
[Sanzo] People die
when they die.

196
00:13:12,529 --> 00:13:15,729
There's no point in trying
to make sense out of it.

197
00:13:15,829 --> 00:13:18,429
Master Sanzo, I'm sorry
you couldn't save him.

198
00:13:18,529 --> 00:13:22,396
But I found someone with
information that might
save others.

199
00:13:22,496 --> 00:13:25,996
If large number of people are
being kidnapped at one time,

200
00:13:26,096 --> 00:13:28,696
then it sounds like
the work of Ikaku.

201
00:13:28,796 --> 00:13:29,896
Ikaku?

202
00:13:29,996 --> 00:13:32,963
He is a demon that
feasts on human souls.

203
00:13:33,063 --> 00:13:35,863
But once their spirits
have been devoured,

204
00:13:35,963 --> 00:13:39,463
he keeps the human bodies alive
to use for his amusement.

205
00:13:41,896 --> 00:13:44,496
And where is this Ikaku now?

206
00:13:44,629 --> 00:13:48,696
[Man] I've heard rumors that
he's using the village of Koton
as his base of operations.

207
00:13:50,696 --> 00:13:52,863
[Mayor] Is something wrong?

208
00:13:52,963 --> 00:13:57,096
It's just that... that's
where we're supposed to
meet up with our friends.

209
00:14:09,763 --> 00:14:11,396
That's the place.

210
00:14:16,029 --> 00:14:18,196
I'll find it in there, huh?

211
00:14:27,429 --> 00:14:29,596
[Zenon] Listen Shunei...
[Shunei] Yes?

212
00:14:29,696 --> 00:14:34,396
You know, years ago I
lost my family to a demon.

213
00:14:34,496 --> 00:14:39,163
A wife and a son.
He'd be about your age
if he hadn't been killed.

214
00:14:42,763 --> 00:14:43,896
[Mirei screams]

215
00:14:52,563 --> 00:14:55,929
[Souei chuckles]
[Zenon] My god! Mirei!

216
00:14:58,763 --> 00:15:00,496
I could not save her.

217
00:15:02,463 --> 00:15:04,896
Don't ever let them
kill you, Shunei.

218
00:15:04,996 --> 00:15:08,596
If you let them, a lot
of people will be hurt.

219
00:15:13,296 --> 00:15:14,429
[Zenon] Is it in here?

220
00:15:16,463 --> 00:15:17,596
[Shunei] Yes...

221
00:15:25,696 --> 00:15:26,829
Well then...

222
00:15:29,863 --> 00:15:31,229
By the way, kid.

223
00:15:31,329 --> 00:15:33,463
Uh, yeah?

224
00:15:33,563 --> 00:15:39,029
It's alright. I won't hate you
if you lied to me about the
scripture being here.

225
00:15:45,396 --> 00:15:48,663
[Gojyo] Zenon, wait!
It's a trap!
[Shunei gasps]

226
00:15:48,763 --> 00:15:52,429
The old lady at the inn
finally fessed up when
we questioned them!

227
00:15:52,529 --> 00:15:54,363
All these people were kidnapped.

228
00:15:54,463 --> 00:15:57,529
They're being held against their
will by a demon named Ikaku.

229
00:15:57,663 --> 00:16:00,296
It's all just an elaborate
trap to ensnare you.

230
00:16:00,396 --> 00:16:02,063
Even this kid!

231
00:16:02,163 --> 00:16:03,496
You keep your hands off!

232
00:16:07,963 --> 00:16:09,029
What happened?!

233
00:16:09,129 --> 00:16:12,163
You've gotta help Zenon!
You just gotta help him!

234
00:16:12,263 --> 00:16:13,529
But you just...

235
00:16:13,629 --> 00:16:16,496
I didn't want him to die!

236
00:16:16,596 --> 00:16:21,096
[Ikaku] I doubt even a god could
have survived getting crushed
and skewered like that.

237
00:16:22,196 --> 00:16:23,529
[Goku] Who's talking?!

238
00:16:23,629 --> 00:16:25,029
[Gojyo] Is that Ikaku?!

239
00:16:25,129 --> 00:16:28,296
[Ikaku] I was only ordered to
take care of Homura's henchman,

240
00:16:28,396 --> 00:16:31,596
but since you're here,
I might as well rack
up some brownie points.

241
00:16:31,729 --> 00:16:33,829
[Loud crashing sound]

242
00:16:34,663 --> 00:16:35,896
[Shunei] What about Zenon?!

243
00:16:35,996 --> 00:16:37,829
[Gojyo] We hafta get outta here!
[Shunei] Zenon!

244
00:16:43,563 --> 00:16:44,763
[Ikaku] Hold it right there!

245
00:16:45,396 --> 00:16:47,529
[Demons growling]

246
00:16:52,363 --> 00:16:55,129
Let me guess...
Ikaku, am I right?

247
00:16:55,229 --> 00:16:58,396
[Ikaku] You'll be put to rest,
just like that friend of yours!

248
00:16:58,496 --> 00:17:00,363
But I'm not sleepy yet!

249
00:17:00,463 --> 00:17:01,929
Prepare for their destruction!

250
00:17:02,029 --> 00:17:03,129
[Mom] No!

251
00:17:03,229 --> 00:17:04,196
Please, please I beg you!

252
00:17:04,296 --> 00:17:06,496
Don't attack while
my son is down there!

253
00:17:06,596 --> 00:17:11,329
But you promised you wouldn't
hurt our little boy if we did
everything you told us to do!

254
00:17:11,429 --> 00:17:14,496
[Shunei] Mom! Dad!
[Mom & Dad] Shunei!

255
00:17:14,596 --> 00:17:16,896
[Gojyo] So the little tyke's
not an orphan either.

256
00:17:16,996 --> 00:17:19,896
I'm afraid these two boys
are not to be trifled with.

257
00:17:19,996 --> 00:17:23,796
We're going to need
every advantage we
have to defeat them.

258
00:17:23,896 --> 00:17:26,263
Just hope that luck
will be on your side.

259
00:17:26,363 --> 00:17:27,329
[Both] Please no!

260
00:17:27,429 --> 00:17:28,563
Fire away!

261
00:17:29,063 --> 00:17:30,196
[Demon yells]

262
00:17:31,296 --> 00:17:32,429
[Demon 2 yells]

263
00:17:33,763 --> 00:17:34,696
Why that was...

264
00:17:34,796 --> 00:17:36,063
A machinegun!

265
00:17:36,163 --> 00:17:37,796
Impossible!

266
00:17:38,363 --> 00:17:39,496
[Shunei] Zenon!

267
00:17:43,029 --> 00:17:45,396
I'm sorry! Forgive me!

268
00:17:45,496 --> 00:17:47,729
[Zenon] I knew.

269
00:17:47,829 --> 00:17:49,963
Those tears I saw you shed...

270
00:17:50,063 --> 00:17:54,529
They were not the tears
of someone who had lost
their loved ones.

271
00:17:54,629 --> 00:17:59,229
They were the tears of someone
who was about to lose them.

272
00:17:59,329 --> 00:18:01,463
Fire! Mow them all down!

273
00:18:02,529 --> 00:18:03,729
[Goku] Missed me!

274
00:18:06,396 --> 00:18:07,529
[Gojyo] Here we go!

275
00:18:09,829 --> 00:18:11,763
Stick close to me, you got it?

276
00:18:11,863 --> 00:18:12,996
Yeah...

277
00:18:24,963 --> 00:18:26,096
[Demon yells]

278
00:18:28,029 --> 00:18:29,196
[Zenon] You catch on quick, kid.

279
00:18:29,296 --> 00:18:31,863
You were right!
That move really works!

280
00:18:36,429 --> 00:18:37,696
Stop goofing around!

281
00:18:37,796 --> 00:18:40,496
I told you to kill
these guys already!

282
00:18:40,596 --> 00:18:42,029
Would you shut him up?!

283
00:18:42,129 --> 00:18:43,263
Would I?!

284
00:18:46,463 --> 00:18:48,063
Wait! Don't kill him, Goku!

285
00:18:52,096 --> 00:18:54,529
How dare you mess
with people's hearts?

286
00:18:55,029 --> 00:18:56,163
[Ikaku yells]

287
00:18:58,696 --> 00:19:00,263
[Dad grunts, mom yells in pain]

288
00:19:00,363 --> 00:19:01,829
[Shunei grunts in pain]

289
00:19:01,929 --> 00:19:03,963
[Zenon] Shunei!
[Gojyo] What is this?

290
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:07,163
The dirty bastard carried around
their souls in his stomach.

291
00:19:08,896 --> 00:19:11,596
When you killed Ikaku...
You killed all of the

292
00:19:11,696 --> 00:19:14,629
townspeople he had devoured
and kept inside him.

293
00:19:14,729 --> 00:19:16,463
We can't save them now.

294
00:19:39,229 --> 00:19:42,263
It can't be... Speak to me!

295
00:19:42,363 --> 00:19:46,363
Shunei! Open your eyes, Shunei!

296
00:19:46,463 --> 00:19:48,996
I told you not to die, didn't I?

297
00:19:51,296 --> 00:19:54,429
<i>[Shunei] This is what I get</i>
<i>for lying to you, Zenon.</i>

298
00:19:54,529 --> 00:19:55,929
<i>When I go to the world beyond,</i>

299
00:19:56,029 --> 00:19:58,563
<i>I wonder if I'll meet</i>
<i>your son there...</i>

300
00:20:00,463 --> 00:20:02,463
<i>I can't wait to meet him...</i>

301
00:20:02,563 --> 00:20:04,829
<i>I know that we'll be friends...</i>

302
00:20:04,929 --> 00:20:07,596
[Zenon] No, not again. Shunei...

303
00:20:08,863 --> 00:20:10,996
[Zenon screams in frustration]

304
00:20:35,337 --> 00:20:39,758
<i>[Zenon] Shunei... Say hi</i>

306
00:20:42,758 --> 00:20:45,291
