1
00:01:39,021 --> 00:01:40,421
[Hakkai] Hold in there, Hakuryu.

2
00:01:40,421 --> 00:01:43,221
We need to make it through this
pass by the end of the day.

3
00:01:43,321 --> 00:01:45,654
[Hakuryu squeaks, while
Goku's stomach rumbles loudly]

4
00:01:45,754 --> 00:01:53,721
[Goku] I'm hungry. I'm hungry.
I'm freezing and hungry.

5
00:01:53,821 --> 00:01:55,354
I'm freezing and hungry,

6
00:01:55,454 --> 00:01:56,721
and freezing and hungry,

7
00:01:56,821 --> 00:01:58,321
and freezing and hungry!

8
00:01:58,421 --> 00:02:01,888
Freezing and hungry, freezing
and hungry, freezing and hungry.

9
00:02:04,554 --> 00:02:08,388
Shut the hell up. You're
just making things worse.

10
00:02:08,488 --> 00:02:11,554
You're the one who said
to go this way, you
non-directional jackass!

11
00:02:11,654 --> 00:02:14,621
Let's not go digging
up the past, shall we?

12
00:02:14,721 --> 00:02:17,321
[Mocking Gojyo] Ooh,
let's go this way, guys!

13
00:02:20,321 --> 00:02:22,054
Shut up, stupid monkey.

14
00:02:29,888 --> 00:02:34,054
[Goku] What the hell's going
on?! Why aren't we moving?!

15
00:02:34,188 --> 00:02:37,054
It looks like this is as far
as Hakuryu's going to go.

16
00:02:37,154 --> 00:02:38,554
You're joking!

17
00:02:40,254 --> 00:02:41,721
[Hakuryu squeaks]

18
00:02:48,654 --> 00:02:50,621
[Goku] "Shed No Tears".

19
00:02:57,521 --> 00:03:02,621
[Gojyo] Whatever I
did to deserve this
misery, I apologize.

20
00:03:07,054 --> 00:03:09,388
I hope you're warm enough.

21
00:03:09,488 --> 00:03:10,954
[Hakuryu squeaks in reply]

22
00:03:12,554 --> 00:03:15,221
[Goku] I'm exhausted.

23
00:03:15,321 --> 00:03:17,221
Get up or I'll stomp you.

24
00:03:18,421 --> 00:03:20,354
So tired.

25
00:03:20,454 --> 00:03:25,221
Will you stop fooling
around and get the
hell up, ya lazy bum?!

26
00:03:25,321 --> 00:03:26,854
[Hakkai] This is strange.
[Gojyo] Huh?

27
00:03:29,188 --> 00:03:34,488
You must mean the fact that he's
complaining about something
besides being hungry.

28
00:03:34,588 --> 00:03:37,788
[Hakkai] No. It's this blizzard.

29
00:03:37,888 --> 00:03:43,421
It seems unseasonably
harsh for this time of
year. Don't you think so?

30
00:03:43,521 --> 00:03:46,354
So it's an ambush,
is it? How quaint.

31
00:03:46,454 --> 00:03:48,554
I know I could use
a little warm up.

32
00:03:50,988 --> 00:03:52,721
[Shoryu] Took you
guys long enough.

33
00:03:52,821 --> 00:03:55,154
I've been waiting all day.

34
00:03:55,254 --> 00:03:57,388
[Gojyo] I'm sorry, did
we have an appointment?

35
00:03:58,821 --> 00:04:01,888
It would have been better
if you died in the blizzard.

36
00:04:01,988 --> 00:04:03,754
Since you've come this far...

37
00:04:03,854 --> 00:04:05,854
Oh well, I guess I'll
have to use force.

38
00:04:07,154 --> 00:04:09,021
Why would that be?

39
00:04:09,121 --> 00:04:13,188
[Shoryu] Because, I intend
to take the Maten Scripture.

40
00:04:13,288 --> 00:04:15,621
[Hakkai] I assume this
storm is your doing as well?

41
00:04:16,921 --> 00:04:18,688
More or less.

42
00:04:23,554 --> 00:04:25,188
Did I hit you too hard?

43
00:04:25,288 --> 00:04:27,154
It's a little trick
I've been working on.

44
00:04:27,254 --> 00:04:28,388
Haven't used it much.

45
00:04:30,521 --> 00:04:33,721
Awesome! That kicked ass!

46
00:04:33,821 --> 00:04:35,688
Tell me! What's your name?

47
00:04:37,954 --> 00:04:39,354
It's Shoryu.

48
00:04:39,454 --> 00:04:42,821
And the next time,
I'll hit you harder.

49
00:05:15,154 --> 00:05:16,821
Huh?! What the-?!

50
00:05:23,021 --> 00:05:25,588
What did ya do, ya brat?!

51
00:05:25,688 --> 00:05:27,821
Just giving you
the cold shoulder.

52
00:05:27,921 --> 00:05:32,621
Using some kind of weirdass
voodoo aren't ya, ya
little son of a bitch?

53
00:05:32,721 --> 00:05:35,454
Well, you're gonna regret it!

54
00:05:35,554 --> 00:05:37,688
Why would I regret it?

55
00:05:37,788 --> 00:05:40,454
I have no place in my life
for such things as regret.

56
00:05:42,388 --> 00:05:43,321
That's not good.

57
00:05:43,421 --> 00:05:46,121
Awesome! Check those out!

58
00:05:53,421 --> 00:05:56,121
Dumb brat, you need
some discipline.

59
00:05:56,221 --> 00:05:58,121
I need the Scripture.

60
00:05:58,221 --> 00:06:01,188
All you're getting from
me, spike boy, is lead.

61
00:06:02,521 --> 00:06:03,654
What?!

62
00:06:22,154 --> 00:06:23,454
[Koushu] So, how
are you feeling?

63
00:06:33,754 --> 00:06:35,954
I so adore willful children.

64
00:06:37,721 --> 00:06:40,288
I have a favor to ask.

65
00:06:40,388 --> 00:06:44,121
You don't mind running a little
errand for me, do you, darling?

66
00:06:45,788 --> 00:06:49,321
I want the Maten and
Seiten Scripture.

67
00:06:49,421 --> 00:06:50,554
You got that?

68
00:06:52,721 --> 00:06:55,021
Such a good boy.

69
00:06:55,121 --> 00:06:56,654
Now get going.

70
00:06:59,288 --> 00:07:00,421
[Sanzo] Brat!

71
00:07:23,088 --> 00:07:25,088
Damn, I can't believe
I missed him!

72
00:07:33,988 --> 00:07:39,588
If you're a good little boy
and you do exactly what I
say, I'll set you free.

73
00:07:41,354 --> 00:07:46,821
Hahaha. And because I like
you so much, I'll even give
you a good luck charm.

74
00:07:47,654 --> 00:07:50,588
[Shoryu screams in pain]

75
00:08:06,354 --> 00:08:09,688
That should make you brave,
and don't come back here...

76
00:08:09,788 --> 00:08:12,588
until you've finished
your chores.

77
00:08:22,688 --> 00:08:24,021
[Gojyo] Think we got 'em?

78
00:08:24,121 --> 00:08:25,288
[Sanzo] No.

79
00:08:25,388 --> 00:08:27,688
[Hakkai] What do you think
made him heistate like that?

80
00:08:35,388 --> 00:08:38,054
Oh wow, did you see
'em? Those blades?

81
00:08:38,154 --> 00:08:40,788
Shit man, those
are awesome! Sweet!

82
00:08:45,221 --> 00:08:46,721
[Sanzo] Stupid monkey.

83
00:08:46,821 --> 00:08:48,854
Boy, that smarts!

84
00:08:48,954 --> 00:08:50,888
What'd he do that for?

85
00:08:50,988 --> 00:08:54,154
Those blades are not to
be admired. Not at all.

86
00:08:54,254 --> 00:08:55,221
Huh?

87
00:08:55,321 --> 00:08:56,521
That boys' blades...

88
00:08:56,621 --> 00:08:58,988
are forbidden magic, Goku.

89
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:19,833
[Koushu] Aah Shoen, you have no
idea how much trouble I went
through to get that charm.

90
00:09:19,933 --> 00:09:21,100
My brother...

91
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,000
I'm sure that he will
succeed, my lady.

92
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:25,667
[Koushu] You think so, huh?

93
00:09:25,767 --> 00:09:27,067
I do.

94
00:09:27,167 --> 00:09:29,600
[Koushu] My, aren't
you a smart one?

95
00:09:31,233 --> 00:09:33,500
[Shoen] Forgive me! I
did not mean to sound...

96
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,067
It's quite alright.

97
00:09:35,167 --> 00:09:38,067
Honestly, I wasn't talking
about him anyway.

98
00:09:38,167 --> 00:09:40,233
But we three are like family.

99
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,800
Don't you worry. I
have plans for Shoryu.

100
00:09:56,900 --> 00:10:00,667
And after all I've done
for the both of you...

101
00:10:00,767 --> 00:10:04,500
I expect you'll be
indebted to me for life.

102
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:05,967
But master...

103
00:10:06,067 --> 00:10:07,667
[Koushu] What is it?

104
00:10:07,767 --> 00:10:08,933
[Shoen] You promised...

105
00:10:09,033 --> 00:10:11,067
[Koushu] Oh, please!

106
00:10:12,067 --> 00:10:15,067
You didn't actually
believe me, did you?

107
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:17,467
I was obviously joking.

108
00:10:17,567 --> 00:10:19,033
What a fool.

109
00:10:22,633 --> 00:10:25,967
You know how much technology
I've invested in you?

110
00:10:27,733 --> 00:10:29,933
How charmingly naive.

111
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,333
Well then.

112
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:39,133
Since Shoryu seems to be
having such a hard time of it,

113
00:10:39,233 --> 00:10:42,000
perhaps I'll send you to Homura.

114
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,567
If I may, please...

115
00:10:47,667 --> 00:10:51,867
I would very much like to have a
charm like Shoryu, Lady Koushu.

116
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:58,067
[Koushu] No. One charm
is more than adequate.

117
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,767
Believe me, it works
better that way.

118
00:11:19,267 --> 00:11:23,933
You two. Tell me,
what are your names?

119
00:11:24,033 --> 00:11:29,167
Shy, are we? Then I'll
just have to come up with
names for you on my own.

120
00:11:29,267 --> 00:11:31,867
You are my very own
children now, after all.

121
00:11:43,167 --> 00:11:44,633
[Homura] Not here either.

122
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,600
What is it?

123
00:11:51,833 --> 00:11:54,067
I'm busy.

124
00:11:54,167 --> 00:11:57,433
You are the War Prince,
are you not?

125
00:11:57,533 --> 00:11:59,900
Did no one ever
teach you manners?

126
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,633
You must introduce yourself
to me first, my dear.

127
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:07,533
[Shoen] I have no
need for a name.

128
00:12:08,767 --> 00:12:12,100
Do you have some
business with me?

129
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:14,967
[Shoen] My business is
with the Seiten Scripture.

130
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,167
That is impossible.

131
00:12:18,267 --> 00:12:19,633
All the same.

132
00:12:20,233 --> 00:12:21,367
Try it.

133
00:12:30,233 --> 00:12:31,500
[Hakkai] That power...

134
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:35,133
Do you think it could really
be forbidden magic after all?

135
00:12:35,233 --> 00:12:36,867
[Sanzo] Possibly.

136
00:12:36,967 --> 00:12:40,300
Tell me, tell me!
What is this magic?

137
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:43,500
Goku, I know that you've
heard about this before.

138
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,467
There's certain types of magic
that are strictly forbidden.

139
00:12:46,567 --> 00:12:47,400
[Goku] But why?

140
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:50,733
Well, that's because... Uh...

141
00:12:52,467 --> 00:12:54,133
Shut up and walk.

142
00:12:54,233 --> 00:12:56,900
Try moving your legs instead
of your mouth, huh?

143
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,167
What's the deal?! Why
can't you answer me, huh?

144
00:13:00,267 --> 00:13:03,500
It's just a stupid question.

145
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:07,533
[Hakkai] Hmm.
[Sanzo] Sure is a
persistant little tyke.

146
00:13:07,633 --> 00:13:08,767
[Hakkai & Gojyo] Huh?

147
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,167
[Gojyo] You...

148
00:13:12,267 --> 00:13:14,633
And quite a little
trouble maker.

149
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:18,167
Oh, I've just begun
making trouble.

150
00:13:18,267 --> 00:13:21,700
[Sanzo] What do you want the
Maten Scripture for anyway?

151
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:24,133
[Shoryu] That's for me to
know and you to find out.

152
00:13:24,233 --> 00:13:26,667
You'll hand it over if you
know what's good for you.

153
00:13:26,767 --> 00:13:28,100
[Gojyo] Don't be stupid.

154
00:13:29,133 --> 00:13:30,567
Pick a fight with us...

155
00:13:30,667 --> 00:13:33,800
And we'll kick your ass!
Even if you are a kid!

156
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:47,733
Well, that wasn't
much fun at all.

157
00:13:52,633 --> 00:13:54,800
[Homura] Now, I like you.

158
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:56,933
That's quite a spell
you have there.

159
00:13:57,033 --> 00:13:58,433
Tell me, what's your name?

160
00:14:00,633 --> 00:14:03,033
I believe I asked
you a question.

161
00:14:06,367 --> 00:14:07,800
My name is...

162
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:08,800
Stand back!

163
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:10,633
Will you serve me?

164
00:14:10,733 --> 00:14:11,700
Serve you?

165
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:14,700
I could certainly use
a spell like that.

166
00:14:15,533 --> 00:14:17,867
Why don't you fight on my side?

167
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,733
[Koushu] Poor things.

168
00:14:29,833 --> 00:14:32,767
You should have listened to me.

169
00:14:32,867 --> 00:14:37,633
You know what happens
to children who won't
obey, don't you?

170
00:14:37,733 --> 00:14:40,200
I'm sure you'll both
be good from now on.

171
00:14:41,733 --> 00:14:45,333
Don't you dare leave here
again without my permission.

172
00:14:48,033 --> 00:14:51,633
There. Understand me?
Because you better.

173
00:15:07,633 --> 00:15:11,433
Jeez... This little
kid is powerful!

174
00:15:11,533 --> 00:15:12,867
[Hakkai] Sanzo...

175
00:15:12,967 --> 00:15:15,100
[Hakuryu squeaks]

176
00:15:19,867 --> 00:15:21,867
Why do you persist on fighting?

177
00:15:27,033 --> 00:15:30,100
The Maten Scripture
isn't worth crap to you.

178
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,200
[Shoryu] I don't
care what it's for.

179
00:15:34,667 --> 00:15:36,500
Then why do you want it?

180
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:38,800
So I can be free again.

181
00:15:46,071 --> 00:15:48,471
Now tell me what you're
here for, my friend.

182
00:15:49,534 --> 00:15:50,934
Answer me!

183
00:15:57,534 --> 00:15:58,934
[Shoen] I won't...

184
00:16:02,101 --> 00:16:04,801
I WON'T!

185
00:16:12,934 --> 00:16:16,968
It would be a shame to kill
a child of such promise.

186
00:16:17,068 --> 00:16:18,934
No matter who you serve.

187
00:16:20,168 --> 00:16:23,134
Begone, and I'll overlook this.

188
00:17:05,034 --> 00:17:06,234
[Shoryu] It'll be okay!

189
00:17:06,968 --> 00:17:08,668
I'll be back soon!

190
00:17:08,768 --> 00:17:10,068
I promise!

191
00:17:16,834 --> 00:17:19,068
[Shoryu] Stop laughing!

192
00:17:19,168 --> 00:17:22,134
[Sanzo] Not only are you a brat,
but you're a fool on top of it.

193
00:17:23,101 --> 00:17:25,268
Open your eyes.

194
00:17:25,368 --> 00:17:27,001
Shut up!

195
00:17:43,801 --> 00:17:46,201
It's... already too late.

196
00:17:57,968 --> 00:18:00,001
[Homura] You won't
get a second chance.

197
00:18:03,601 --> 00:18:06,634
If only I had acted earlier...

198
00:18:06,734 --> 00:18:10,034
If only I had acted earlier
before it was too late.

199
00:18:10,568 --> 00:18:12,368
[Shoen screams]

200
00:18:14,268 --> 00:18:20,368
Dumbass. What you're searching
so hard for is not someone
else's to give, I'm afraid.

201
00:18:21,901 --> 00:18:23,734
I don't know what
you're talking about.

202
00:18:23,834 --> 00:18:27,168
I never had anyone around to
teach me things like that.

203
00:18:27,268 --> 00:18:30,801
Of course you didn't. Now
stop whining, you crybaby.

204
00:18:40,901 --> 00:18:42,768
Enough of this.

205
00:18:42,868 --> 00:18:45,434
I'm through playing
around with you, kid.

206
00:18:47,201 --> 00:18:49,034
You want your freedom?

207
00:18:50,834 --> 00:18:51,968
Then live.

208
00:19:24,668 --> 00:19:27,801
[Shoryu crying]

209
00:19:44,734 --> 00:19:45,701
[Hakkai] Sanzo...

210
00:19:45,801 --> 00:19:47,701
[Goku] Did he...

211
00:19:47,801 --> 00:19:50,634
What did that little
brat do this time, huh?

212
00:19:52,601 --> 00:19:56,101
I guess... he chose to be free.

213
00:19:57,501 --> 00:19:59,301
He must think...

214
00:20:01,668 --> 00:20:04,701
eternal freedom can
be found in Heaven.

215
00:20:14,201 --> 00:20:16,601
I told you he was a stupid brat.

216
00:20:21,268 --> 00:20:23,268
[Koushu] Where are they?

217
00:20:23,368 --> 00:20:25,534
I guess I wasn't strict
enough with them.

218
00:20:26,834 --> 00:20:28,968
Oh well. I'll change that.

219
00:20:31,401 --> 00:20:32,534
Shoen!

220
00:20:37,334 --> 00:20:39,401
Hello?! Anyone here?!

221
00:20:40,201 --> 00:20:42,834
Why won't anyone answer ME?!
