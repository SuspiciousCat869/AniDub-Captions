1
00:01:33,955 --> 00:01:36,388
[Nataku groans in
pain and coughs]

2
00:01:41,589 --> 00:01:43,489
[Shien] Well fought,
Prince Nataku.

3
00:01:43,589 --> 00:01:45,056
It's time to go home now.

4
00:01:45,156 --> 00:01:46,889
[Nataku] Leave me alone!

5
00:01:46,989 --> 00:01:48,723
I wanna see this...

6
00:01:48,823 --> 00:01:50,289
just a little longer.

7
00:01:50,389 --> 00:01:51,156
[Shien] But why?

8
00:01:51,256 --> 00:01:53,289
[Nataku] I wanna stay here!

9
00:01:53,389 --> 00:01:55,756
I'll be fine!

10
00:01:55,856 --> 00:01:58,623
Just leave me be!

11
00:01:58,723 --> 00:02:01,556
<i>[Shien] What did you see</i>
<i>that day, Lord Nataku?</i>

12
00:02:01,656 --> 00:02:03,856
<i>What did you see?</i>

13
00:02:10,623 --> 00:02:12,756
[Goku] "Ugly beautiful."

14
00:02:20,356 --> 00:02:22,889
[Gojyo] Hey, leggo my egg roll.

15
00:02:22,989 --> 00:02:25,389
[Goku] Ooh, no, not today!

16
00:02:25,489 --> 00:02:28,923
[Gojyo] This is human food.
Go find a banana or something.

17
00:02:29,023 --> 00:02:31,689
[Goku] Why don't you find a
cucumber, water sprite?!

18
00:02:33,789 --> 00:02:37,289
Oooh. Now you've
done it, primate.

19
00:02:37,389 --> 00:02:41,756
Yeah well, they're both about
the right size to satisfy
a pervert like you.

20
00:02:41,856 --> 00:02:46,556
You had better learn to heel,
monkey, or I will rub
your nose in it.

21
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:51,089
I'm just getting started,
but I think it's about
time we settle this.

22
00:02:51,189 --> 00:02:54,589
[Gojyo] Let's finish it!
[Goku] Any time,
any place, fool!

23
00:02:55,989 --> 00:02:57,123
[Gojyo] Uh...

24
00:03:01,156 --> 00:03:03,289
[Hakuyru squeaks happily]

25
00:03:05,323 --> 00:03:06,589
[The patrons laugh]

26
00:03:06,689 --> 00:03:08,456
It's so peaceful.

27
00:03:08,556 --> 00:03:10,889
Hmph. It's about time.

28
00:03:10,989 --> 00:03:12,256
No, not them.

29
00:03:12,356 --> 00:03:14,023
I meant the village, Sanzo.

30
00:03:14,123 --> 00:03:15,289
Hm?

31
00:03:15,389 --> 00:03:18,889
I couldn't help but notice
it when we arrived in town.

32
00:03:18,989 --> 00:03:22,856
It's nice to finally find
a place where we haven't
run into any demons.

33
00:03:22,956 --> 00:03:24,823
Everyone's so lively.

34
00:03:24,923 --> 00:03:28,723
Bet they're gearing up for
some kind of celebration.

35
00:03:28,823 --> 00:03:32,089
[Waitress] I'm so sorry. I
thought you guys knew about it.
[Hakkai] Huh?

36
00:03:32,189 --> 00:03:35,489
I just assumed you guys came
for the God Festival like
everybody else.

37
00:03:35,589 --> 00:03:37,089
The God Festival?

38
00:03:37,189 --> 00:03:41,156
Yep. Every year around
this time, a god descends
to the land of Saika.

39
00:03:43,289 --> 00:03:44,989
[Hakkai] A god?

40
00:03:45,089 --> 00:03:48,489
[Waitress] That's right.
It's what has kept the peace
here for all these years.

41
00:03:48,589 --> 00:03:52,556
And today is the day we
have chosen to express our
gratitude to the heavens.

42
00:03:52,656 --> 00:03:55,556
How cool!
A god is coming to town?

43
00:03:55,656 --> 00:03:58,156
Have you ever seen
what he looks like?

44
00:03:58,256 --> 00:04:01,189
Oh, come on.
You can't see a god.

45
00:04:01,289 --> 00:04:03,023
I thought everybody knew that.

46
00:04:03,123 --> 00:04:04,223
That's not true, I-

47
00:04:04,323 --> 00:04:06,589
Ah! Of course we did!

48
00:04:06,689 --> 00:04:08,789
What's this god's name?

49
00:04:08,889 --> 00:04:10,556
His name?

50
00:04:10,656 --> 00:04:13,423
Why it's Lord Shien, of course.

51
00:04:13,789 --> 00:04:15,489
Shien?

52
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:16,723
[Waitress] I kinda like it.

53
00:04:18,823 --> 00:04:20,656
[Zenon] Not that it's
any of my business,

54
00:04:20,756 --> 00:04:22,689
but where were you off to?

55
00:04:22,789 --> 00:04:24,789
Just out for some air.

56
00:04:24,889 --> 00:04:27,223
I could use a little
bit of exercise.

57
00:04:27,323 --> 00:04:28,389
[Zenon laughs]

58
00:04:28,489 --> 00:04:30,723
Man, you're a terrible liar.

59
00:04:30,823 --> 00:04:33,856
How long have I known you?
Five hundred years?

60
00:04:33,956 --> 00:04:36,556
And every year
it's the same thing.

61
00:04:36,656 --> 00:04:41,523
You go back on down there
to reminisce about Nataku.

62
00:04:41,623 --> 00:04:43,089
And what for?

63
00:04:43,189 --> 00:04:47,089
[Shien] Like I said.
I need the exercise.

64
00:04:47,223 --> 00:04:51,456
Why do you insist on continuing
to sulk about it is beyond me.

65
00:04:51,556 --> 00:04:55,323
It's not like it's your fault
Nataku ended up that way.

66
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:56,956
Get over it, man.

67
00:04:57,056 --> 00:04:58,623
It's ancient history.

68
00:04:58,723 --> 00:05:03,589
To be honest, I'm not
quite sure what is true
in this world anymore.

69
00:05:05,123 --> 00:05:06,889
[Zenon] Huh?

70
00:05:06,989 --> 00:05:08,923
What a caring young man.

71
00:05:09,689 --> 00:05:11,923
It is Shien, isn't it?

72
00:05:12,023 --> 00:05:14,623
Aw man. So it's not Homura?

73
00:05:14,723 --> 00:05:17,623
As much as I don't like
having demons around,

74
00:05:17,723 --> 00:05:20,423
gods bring their own set
of problems with them.

75
00:05:20,556 --> 00:05:23,756
Regardless, there's no
reason to stick around.

76
00:05:23,856 --> 00:05:29,423
[Hakkai] Yep. I'll feel better
as soon as we put some distance
between us and this place.

77
00:05:30,423 --> 00:05:32,656
<i>[Huang] Lirin?! Lirin!</i>

78
00:05:35,823 --> 00:05:38,723
[Huang] Where could that
brat have run off to?!

79
00:05:38,823 --> 00:05:41,656
Did you lose something,
Dr. Huang?

80
00:05:41,756 --> 00:05:44,456
[Huang] That little monster
took off in the middle
of my experiment!

81
00:05:44,556 --> 00:05:47,123
What am I suppose to do now?!
I need that data!

82
00:05:47,223 --> 00:05:50,689
No need to get your panties
all in a bunch over it.

83
00:05:50,789 --> 00:05:55,623
Besides, I seem to recall you
were against experimenting
on our little princess.

84
00:05:55,723 --> 00:05:58,623
But once the Lady has
given an order, I obey!

85
00:05:58,723 --> 00:06:02,923
I was just upset
about my evaluation,
if it's any of your business.

86
00:06:03,023 --> 00:06:04,156
Oh, you don't say?

87
00:06:05,423 --> 00:06:07,889
[Huang growls]
<i>Don't let him get to you.</i>

88
00:06:07,989 --> 00:06:09,823
[Huang] Lirin, you
can come out now!

89
00:06:09,923 --> 00:06:11,623
I've got some candy!

90
00:06:11,723 --> 00:06:13,156
Aye yi.

91
00:06:13,256 --> 00:06:14,656
[Lirin] Is the coast clear?

92
00:06:14,756 --> 00:06:17,289
Yes, you can come out now.

93
00:06:17,389 --> 00:06:19,556
Yippie! I'm free at last!

94
00:06:19,656 --> 00:06:20,689
You're welcome.

95
00:06:20,789 --> 00:06:24,356
I swear, that woman is
so persistent, sheesh.

96
00:06:24,456 --> 00:06:25,689
Agreed.

97
00:06:25,789 --> 00:06:28,723
I still don't understand why
you helped me hide from her.

98
00:06:28,823 --> 00:06:30,489
I wasn't doing anything.

99
00:06:30,589 --> 00:06:35,289
And I'd thwart Ms. Huang even
if the Gyumaoh project
wasn't stalled.

100
00:06:35,389 --> 00:06:37,156
[Lirin] Is that so?
[Ni] Yep.

101
00:06:37,256 --> 00:06:40,989
I'm afraid the Seiten Scripture
has been stolen from us.

102
00:06:41,089 --> 00:06:42,623
What?!

103
00:06:42,723 --> 00:06:45,256
The Seiten Scripture
has been stolen?!

104
00:06:45,356 --> 00:06:47,656
I'm sorry, I thought you knew.

105
00:06:47,756 --> 00:06:52,256
I'm afraid our pompous
little prince picked a
fight with a god and lost.

106
00:06:52,356 --> 00:06:54,589
And it cost us the scripture.

107
00:06:55,356 --> 00:06:57,656
He beat my brother?

108
00:06:57,756 --> 00:07:04,389
[Ni] You can't really blame
him. The Prince did fight
a god, after all.

109
00:07:04,489 --> 00:07:07,723
But perhaps the
Princess could win.

110
00:07:07,823 --> 00:07:12,356
This god fella, take me
to him and I'll show him!

111
00:07:12,456 --> 00:07:16,589
Let's just do a quick little
search on gods, shall we?

112
00:07:16,689 --> 00:07:23,056
Ooh! It looks like we know the
exact location of where a god
will be showing up today.

113
00:07:23,156 --> 00:07:24,723
You do? Show me!

114
00:07:24,823 --> 00:07:27,589
Saika, huh? You're toast, buddy!

115
00:07:34,689 --> 00:07:36,589
[Ni] You show him, princess.

116
00:07:36,689 --> 00:07:38,656
Teach that god who's boss,

117
00:07:38,756 --> 00:07:41,689
so I can collect
some wonderful data.

118
00:07:42,623 --> 00:07:44,789
[Sounds of Gyumaoh
and Nataku battling]

119
00:07:46,756 --> 00:07:49,123
[Soldier 1] Lord Shien,
you have to let us attack!

120
00:07:49,223 --> 00:07:51,489
[Soldier 2] Nataku can't
fight Gyumaoh on his own!
It's suicide!

121
00:07:51,589 --> 00:07:54,323
I don't care if he is a war god!

122
00:07:54,423 --> 00:07:56,889
Do you really intend
to just stand there?

123
00:07:56,989 --> 00:08:00,089
I'm afraid I can't
allow you to engage.

124
00:08:00,189 --> 00:08:05,389
Li Touten has given us strict
orders that this is to be
between Gyumaoh and Nataku.

125
00:08:05,489 --> 00:08:07,923
But lord! For the soldiers
of the Heavenly Army to

126
00:08:08,056 --> 00:08:10,523
just stand by and watch
as one of our own...

127
00:08:10,623 --> 00:08:15,589
Is humiliating, isn't it?
I agree.

128
00:08:15,689 --> 00:08:18,723
But I would not be so eager
to kill if I were you.

129
00:08:18,823 --> 00:08:23,089
Are you really so eager to get
demon blood on your hands?

130
00:08:24,589 --> 00:08:27,389
<i>Now that the Emperor</i>
<i>has found his scapegoat,</i>

131
00:08:27,489 --> 00:08:31,256
<i>perhaps you think wiping</i>
<i>them out will curry you</i>
<i>favor somehow.</i>

132
00:08:31,356 --> 00:08:36,156
<i>But you'll gain nothing by</i>

133
00:08:36,256 --> 00:08:42,089
<i>No, we shall wait here until</i>

[Birds chirp in the distance]

135
00:09:24,123 --> 00:09:27,523
<i>[Shien] Why Nataku preferred</i>
<i>this mundane scenery to the</i>

144
00:10:03,323 --> 00:10:04,923
I've found you, god!

[Lirin yells]

00:10:15,856 --> 00:10:19,956
My goodness! You're too
powerful! I give up!

147
00:10:20,056 --> 00:10:22,256
Stop playing around and get up.

148
00:10:22,356 --> 00:10:24,856
Hehe, was I that obvious?

149
00:10:34,096 --> 00:10:37,396
[Lirin] Hey you! Bad god guy!

150
00:10:37,396 --> 00:10:41,162
Yeah you! You'll pay
for beating my brother!

151

Prepare to totally get your
ass kicked and hand over

You're... Gyumaoh's
daughter, aren't you?

00:10:51,229 --> 00:10:53,529
Hey! Stop running away!

154
00:10:53,629 --> 00:10:55,062
[Shien] Run away?

155
00:10:55,162 --> 00:10:56,829
The very idea...

156
00:10:56,929 --> 00:10:59,129
This should be about far enough.

157
00:10:59,229 --> 00:11:01,362
Very well. Shall we?

158
00:11:01,462 --> 00:11:05,129
Hehe! Not nearly
far enough, mister!

159
00:11:05,229 --> 00:11:07,229
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, YEAH!

160
00:11:11,729 --> 00:11:14,829
Nyah, nyah! You missed me!

161
00:11:14,929 --> 00:11:19,929
[Shien] Of course I did. I stood
far enough back so you'd have
time to dodge my attack.

162
00:11:20,896 --> 00:11:22,862
[Lirin yells]

163
00:11:22,962 --> 00:11:26,029
<i>[Lirin] That was just a</i>
<i>shockwave of his whip!</i>

164
00:11:26,129 --> 00:11:30,329
<i>Better not get close</i>
<i>enough to see what the</i>
<i>real thing feels like.</i>

165
00:11:30,429 --> 00:11:34,329
<i>I know. I'll do little</i>
<i>Lirin fireballs instead!</i>

166
00:11:36,729 --> 00:11:41,662
<i>[Shien] A cute trick.</i>
<i>But a bit outside your</i>
<i>age group, don't you think?</i>

167
00:11:41,762 --> 00:11:45,362
<i>It's about time you children</i>
<i>learned not to play with fire.</i>

168
00:11:48,929 --> 00:11:51,596
[Gojyo growls]
[Goku] What the hell, Hakkai?!

169
00:11:51,696 --> 00:11:52,862
Huh?

170
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:54,062
[Hakkai] Miss Yaone?

171
00:11:54,162 --> 00:11:55,329
Why, it's you.

172
00:11:55,429 --> 00:11:57,896
You should be more careful.
Watch where you're going.

173
00:11:57,996 --> 00:12:00,196
[Yaone] I'm sorry, but I'm
a little frantic right now.

174
00:12:00,296 --> 00:12:02,329
I can't seem to
find Lirin anywhere.

175
00:12:02,429 --> 00:12:03,629
Is she lost?

176
00:12:03,729 --> 00:12:05,662
[Yaone] She snuck out
of the castle last night,

177
00:12:05,796 --> 00:12:08,529
so I was hoping I might
find her here with you guys.

178
00:12:08,629 --> 00:12:10,096
Have you seen her?

179
00:12:10,196 --> 00:12:13,262
Yeah, Sanzo. Have YOU seen her?

180
00:12:13,362 --> 00:12:14,529
Why are you asking me?

181
00:12:14,629 --> 00:12:17,729
Well, she is your
play pal, isn't sh-

182
00:12:17,829 --> 00:12:18,929
Please continue.

183
00:12:19,029 --> 00:12:20,396
Mommy...

184
00:12:20,496 --> 00:12:22,962
Where in the world could
she have run off to?

185
00:12:23,062 --> 00:12:25,662
And you've seen absolutely
no sign of her?

186
00:12:25,762 --> 00:12:29,296
Well, yes. I've found one
of the flying dragons nearby.

187
00:12:30,696 --> 00:12:31,829
You don't think she...

188
00:12:32,696 --> 00:12:33,829
It's Shien.

189
00:12:34,162 --> 00:12:34,962
What?

190
00:12:35,062 --> 00:12:36,196
[Loud explosion in the distance]

191
00:12:37,329 --> 00:12:40,062
That looks like his
handiwork to me alright.

192
00:12:40,162 --> 00:12:41,162
Oh, no! Lirin!

193
00:12:41,262 --> 00:12:42,562
Wait! Yaone!

194
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:44,396
Whoa!

195
00:12:45,029 --> 00:12:46,062
[Hakkai] We'll take you.

196
00:12:46,162 --> 00:12:47,829
Dammit, Hakkai!

197
00:12:47,929 --> 00:12:48,962
I know, I know.

198
00:12:49,062 --> 00:12:51,796
But we can't just leave
her like this, can we?

199
00:12:51,896 --> 00:12:53,029
Tch.

200
00:12:54,696 --> 00:12:57,462
[Lirin] Die, will you!

201
00:12:57,562 --> 00:13:01,929
<i>[Shien] So I fight the daughter</i>
<i>of the demon I refused to</i>
<i>face so long ago.</i>

202
00:13:02,029 --> 00:13:03,796
<i>Perhaps this was meant to be.</i>

203
00:13:04,496 --> 00:13:06,629
[Lirin gasp, then yells]

204
00:13:12,096 --> 00:13:15,729
[Shien] You should know we
gods are very egalitarian.

205
00:13:15,829 --> 00:13:18,096
We never discriminate.

206
00:13:18,196 --> 00:13:22,196
Demons, women and children
all have a chance...

207
00:13:22,296 --> 00:13:25,929
to join us or die,
however they see fit.

208
00:13:28,262 --> 00:13:31,529
Tell me, which do you choose?

209
00:13:34,796 --> 00:13:36,396
[Yaone] I'm coming, Lirin!

210
00:13:47,529 --> 00:13:49,996
Not a wise choice.

211
00:13:50,096 --> 00:13:52,896
[Lirin] Wow, Yaone. What are
you doing with the bald monk?

212
00:13:52,996 --> 00:13:54,362
I thought they
were the bad guys?

213
00:13:54,462 --> 00:13:56,396
Trust me, it's only temporary.

214
00:13:56,496 --> 00:13:59,296
[Goku] What are we running for?
We can take him, easy.

215
00:13:59,396 --> 00:14:03,096
[Gojyo] For once,
I agree with the monkey.
He's alone this time.

216
00:14:03,196 --> 00:14:06,996
[Hakkai] We shouldn't run
headlong into battle with
a god, alone or not.

217
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:08,562
[Goku] But he's right there!

218
00:14:08,662 --> 00:14:11,496
[Sanzo] Shut up and walk. We
get in enough fixes on our own.

219
00:14:12,496 --> 00:14:14,562
[Gojyo] What the...?!

220
00:14:14,662 --> 00:14:17,662
[Hakkai] Looks like Shien
found the trap that Yaone set.

221
00:14:17,796 --> 00:14:21,196
Though I'm willing to bet it
didn't slow him down much.

222
00:14:21,296 --> 00:14:23,929
[Yaone] No, but at least
we know where he is now.

223
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:25,796
Pretty close from
the looks of it.

224
00:14:25,896 --> 00:14:27,729
I give up.

225
00:14:27,829 --> 00:14:30,429
Hey, where do ya
think you're going?

226
00:14:30,529 --> 00:14:32,296
[Hakkai] To see
if I can stall him.

227
00:14:32,396 --> 00:14:35,096
You guys find a way out of here.
I'll catch up with you later.

228
00:14:35,196 --> 00:14:36,896
I wanna go too!

229
00:14:36,996 --> 00:14:39,962
The only one who's allowed
to beat you up is me.

230
00:14:40,062 --> 00:14:41,496
So let me take 'em.

231
00:14:41,596 --> 00:14:43,262
Listen, Hakkai...

232
00:14:43,362 --> 00:14:45,496
Are you sure about this?

233
00:14:45,596 --> 00:14:51,196
Yes. If Shien's after anything,
it's either Lirin or your
Maten Scripture, so...

234
00:14:51,296 --> 00:14:54,596
[Hakuryu squeaks sadly]

235
00:14:54,696 --> 00:14:57,196
[Hakkai] Please take
care of Hakuryu for me.

236
00:14:57,296 --> 00:14:58,329
All right.

237
00:14:58,429 --> 00:15:00,596
All right?! That's it?!

238
00:15:00,696 --> 00:15:02,196
You're going to leave them?!

239
00:15:02,296 --> 00:15:04,729
That's right. Let's go.

240
00:15:04,829 --> 00:15:08,596
How can you just abandon your
friends like that? I swear!

241
00:15:08,696 --> 00:15:10,096
Step aside!

242
00:15:10,196 --> 00:15:12,529
[Sanzo growls]
[Lirin gasp]

243
00:15:13,962 --> 00:15:15,696
[Sanzo] What a pain in the ass.

244
00:15:15,796 --> 00:15:20,829
Master Sanzo, I know that you've
done an awful lot for me.

245
00:15:20,929 --> 00:15:23,862
So I feel I should
tell you next time...

246
00:15:23,962 --> 00:15:27,429
I will be forced to take the
Maten Scripture from you.

247
00:15:27,529 --> 00:15:31,529
[Sanzo] Hmph.
[Yaone] Please take good
care of Lirin for me.

248
00:15:31,629 --> 00:15:33,596
[Sanzo] I'm dumping
her outside the forest.

249
00:15:33,696 --> 00:15:36,196
Thanks. That's all I ask.

250
00:15:48,229 --> 00:15:51,629
[Shien] My...
Three demons against me.

251
00:15:51,729 --> 00:15:54,229
No. Make that four.

252
00:15:54,329 --> 00:15:57,696
[Hakkai] Yaone!
[Yaone] Don't mind if I
crash the boys club, do you?

253
00:15:57,829 --> 00:15:59,296
[Hakkai] But...
[Yaone] Well, do you?

254
00:15:59,396 --> 00:16:02,396
[Gojyo] What the hell.
I'm always looking for
some female companionship.

255
00:16:02,496 --> 00:16:05,562
I guess it's your choice.

256
00:16:05,662 --> 00:16:07,029
Do you mind?

257
00:16:07,129 --> 00:16:11,029
To be honest, it's not my habit
to gang up on someone like this.

258
00:16:11,129 --> 00:16:13,362
It's quite alright.
I don't mind.

259
00:16:13,462 --> 00:16:17,762
I should tell you, I think
we have the better hand, chump.

260
00:16:17,862 --> 00:16:20,162
He said it's fine. Let's go!

261
00:16:21,662 --> 00:16:23,162
That's true.

262
00:16:23,262 --> 00:16:26,562
It looks like I'll get that
work out I was looking for.

263
00:16:38,162 --> 00:16:39,296
Stand back!

264
00:16:45,962 --> 00:16:47,096
Got him?

265
00:16:52,396 --> 00:16:53,362
<i>[Shien] Tenpou...</i>

266
00:16:53,462 --> 00:16:54,596
[Gojyo] Hakkai!

267
00:17:07,362 --> 00:17:09,162
[Goku, growling] You're mine!

268
00:17:26,562 --> 00:17:29,929
Son Goku...

269
00:17:37,496 --> 00:17:39,062
[Goku] Can't tie me up!

270
00:17:44,462 --> 00:17:47,096
<i>[Shien] I see your</i>
<i>skills are improving.</i>

271
00:17:51,296 --> 00:17:52,362
[Shien chuckles]

272
00:17:52,462 --> 00:17:53,396
Huh?!

273
00:17:53,496 --> 00:17:55,196
[Shien] Thanks for the work out.

274
00:17:55,296 --> 00:17:59,962
I shall keep you in mind for
the next time I'm in need
of a good sparring partner.

275
00:18:00,062 --> 00:18:03,496
What the hell?!
We just got started!

276
00:18:03,596 --> 00:18:06,462
Get yer butt back heeere!

277
00:18:15,697 --> 00:18:17,919
<i>[Nataku] But Shien,</i>
<i>I promised to show him</i>

278
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:21,752
<i>around the Heavens as soon</i>
<i>as my wounds were healed!</i>

279
00:18:21,852 --> 00:18:23,086
<i>I have to!</i>

280
00:18:23,186 --> 00:18:26,752
<i>[Shien] Prince Nataku,</i>
<i>who are you referring to?</i>

281
00:18:26,852 --> 00:18:31,819
<i>[Nataku] I don't know.</i>
<i>He said he didn't have a name.</i>

282
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:36,419
[Shien] Prince Nataku,
perhaps one day I too
will be able to see

283
00:18:36,519 --> 00:18:38,552
what you saw in that place.

284
00:18:39,619 --> 00:18:41,952
[Footsteps approaching]

285
00:18:42,052 --> 00:18:43,019
[Homura] How'd it go?

286
00:18:43,119 --> 00:18:45,952
[Shien] Actually, it
was quite productive.

287
00:18:47,719 --> 00:18:49,086
[Zenon] Are those your whips?

288
00:18:49,186 --> 00:18:51,252
Did Goku do this?!

289
00:18:51,352 --> 00:18:53,052
He did.

290
00:18:53,152 --> 00:18:55,586
I think it's time, don't you?

291
00:18:59,719 --> 00:19:02,252
[Homura] It certainly
appears that way.

292
00:19:04,286 --> 00:19:06,686
[Lirin] I got it!
It's mine, it's mine!

293
00:19:06,786 --> 00:19:09,152
[Yaone] Lirin, stop it!
You're acting like a child!
[Lirin] Yippie! Yippie! Yippie!

294
00:19:09,252 --> 00:19:10,986
She got you good, Sanzo.

295
00:19:11,086 --> 00:19:12,586
[Lirin] Heh!
[Goku] Hey!

296
00:19:12,686 --> 00:19:15,552
[Sanzo] Tell me... why
is this brat still around?
[Goku and Lirin argue]

297
00:19:15,652 --> 00:19:17,119
[Hakkai] Put down the gun.

298
00:19:17,219 --> 00:19:20,886
Since we were here,
I figured that maybe
we would enjoy the festival.

299
00:19:20,986 --> 00:19:21,986
[Goku] Give it back!

300
00:19:22,086 --> 00:19:23,819
[Hakki] Now that
I've faced him...

301
00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:26,752
I understand him so much better.

302
00:19:26,852 --> 00:19:31,552
I've never fought anyone
with such utter conviction
and determination.

303
00:19:31,652 --> 00:19:34,686
You know, I know
exactly what you mean.

304
00:19:34,786 --> 00:19:37,386
His strength is entirely
different from Homura's

305
00:19:37,486 --> 00:19:40,686
or Zenon's on a strictly
fundamental level.

306
00:19:40,786 --> 00:19:42,652
If that's true then...

307
00:19:42,752 --> 00:19:44,586
he may be plagued
with self doubt or

308
00:19:44,686 --> 00:19:47,052
questioning his purpose,
if you know what I mean.

309
00:19:48,852 --> 00:19:53,986
If you probe deeply enough,
you'll find most tough guys
are all the same way.

310
00:19:54,086 --> 00:19:56,619
[Hakkai] You really think so?

311
00:19:56,719 --> 00:20:00,586
You're telling me you don't
sense it in yourselves?

312
00:20:00,686 --> 00:20:04,419
Inside your heart of hearts,
you're plagued with doubt
and uncertainty,

313
00:20:04,519 --> 00:20:08,686
so you fight to feel like you
have control of your own lives.

314
00:20:08,786 --> 00:20:12,119
Because in the struggle,
you can find your purpose.

315
00:20:12,219 --> 00:20:14,519
Hmph. Maybe so.

316
00:20:14,619 --> 00:20:17,252
That goes for you to, I suppose.

317
00:20:19,119 --> 00:20:20,852
You ate it all, didn't you?!

318
00:20:20,952 --> 00:20:22,819
You're gonna pay for this!

319
00:20:22,919 --> 00:20:25,852
[Lirin] Yum, yum! Hehe!
[Goku] You're so dead!

320
00:20:25,952 --> 00:20:30,952
Do you think those gods
stand a chance against
such insecure guys?

321
00:20:31,052 --> 00:20:32,052
Probably not.

322
00:20:32,152 --> 00:20:33,919
[Goku] Get back here!
[Lirin laughs]

323
00:20:38,252 --> 00:20:41,419
He he. Look here, Snoogums.

324
00:20:41,519 --> 00:20:44,552
What interesting data we have.
