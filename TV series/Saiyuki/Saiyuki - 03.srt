1
00:01:42,168 --> 00:01:43,835
[Jiroushin] Pardon me, Goddess,

2
00:01:43,935 --> 00:01:47,835
but why did you send the choosen
four on an earthbound path?

3
00:01:47,935 --> 00:01:51,802
Their journey west would be far
faster if you would have allowed
them Heavenly travel.

4
00:01:51,902 --> 00:01:54,168
[Merciful] Geographical
arrival's not the only goal.

5
00:01:54,268 --> 00:01:57,668
Currently, they are painfully
lacking in both the ability
and the solidarity

6
00:01:57,768 --> 00:02:00,968
that will be necessary for them
to accomplish our true goal.

7
00:02:01,102 --> 00:02:06,435
They're not only traveling to a
physical destination but a
spiritual one as well.

8
00:02:06,535 --> 00:02:10,768
Of course. I'm sorry, I should
not have doubted your methods.

9
00:02:10,868 --> 00:02:14,502
I'm kidding. It's just that it's
so much more interesting this
way. Don't you think?

10
00:02:26,868 --> 00:02:28,902
[Goku] 996...

11
00:02:29,002 --> 00:02:34,602
997, 998, 999...

12
00:02:34,702 --> 00:02:36,135
One thousand!

13
00:02:37,868 --> 00:02:39,568
That's it I'm done!

14
00:02:39,668 --> 00:02:42,802
Time to throw 'em down and have
one of you guys pick up
the pack!

15
00:02:45,668 --> 00:02:48,802
[Everyone] One, two, three...

16
00:02:48,902 --> 00:02:53,202
This is bullshit! Next time
we're gonna draw straws or
something like that!

17
00:02:53,302 --> 00:02:55,335
He'll be carrying that pack all
the way to India.

18
00:02:55,435 --> 00:02:59,668
He always throws down scissors.
You'd think he'd catch on
by now.

19
00:02:59,768 --> 00:03:01,368
Pick it up, let's go.

20
00:03:01,468 --> 00:03:04,268
Ugh, how much farther do we have
to walk?!

21
00:03:04,368 --> 00:03:07,068
[Hakkai] As long as the path is
impassable by jeep.

22
00:03:10,035 --> 00:03:13,602
God you suck! I know you can
turn into something other than
a jeep!

23
00:03:13,702 --> 00:03:17,202
You just don't want to give us
a ride!

24
00:03:17,302 --> 00:03:22,035
Sanzo, I believe it's time to
put your animal and Hakkai's
animal in seperate cages.

25
00:03:25,168 --> 00:03:27,068
At this break neck pace it
doesn't look like we're going

26
00:03:27,168 --> 00:03:29,635
to get past the mountain range
by sunset.

27
00:03:29,735 --> 00:03:34,568
All right, then. I suggest
accommodations at this humble
little establishment.

28
00:03:44,002 --> 00:03:45,135
Aw man!

29
00:03:45,235 --> 00:03:47,635
Now this is my kind of humble
little establishment.

30
00:03:47,735 --> 00:03:48,868
Excuse me!

31
00:03:50,302 --> 00:03:52,002
What is it that you want?

32
00:03:52,102 --> 00:03:54,535
[Hakkai] We're traveling west
and it grows dark.

33
00:03:54,635 --> 00:03:57,068
We humbly request accomedations
for the night.

34
00:03:57,168 --> 00:04:00,335
This is a sacred temple, and
none but the holy and
the blessed

35
00:04:00,435 --> 00:04:03,202
may enter this door way or
reside within these walls.

36
00:04:03,302 --> 00:04:05,402
Shit! What the hell's up
with that?!

37
00:04:05,502 --> 00:04:09,668
Monks! They're all religious
hypocrites too busy praying to
practice what they preach!

38
00:04:09,768 --> 00:04:11,002
[Sanzo] Watch your mouth.

39
00:04:11,102 --> 00:04:12,835
[Hakkai] Yeah. Hold it down.

40
00:04:12,935 --> 00:04:15,368
Man! I'm hungry do something

41
00:04:15,468 --> 00:04:16,668
Sanzo!

42
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:19,068
By the goddess, he said Sanzo!

43
00:04:19,168 --> 00:04:22,935
[Monk A] Yes, he wears the robes
of the late Koumyou Sanzo.

44
00:04:23,035 --> 00:04:27,735
The Founding Scripture of
Heaven and Earth they adorn
his shoulders.

45
00:04:27,835 --> 00:04:32,635
The crimson chakra upon his
brow, the mark of one close
to the gods.

46
00:04:34,702 --> 00:04:36,335
Forgive us, Genjo Sanzo!

47
00:04:36,435 --> 00:04:39,168
Sanzo! I will go and tell the
others he's here!

48
00:04:39,268 --> 00:04:41,402
I will be right down to let
you inside!

49
00:04:49,802 --> 00:04:53,335
Priest Sanzo, you honor this
old temple with your presence.

50
00:04:53,435 --> 00:04:55,435
You will be extended
every courtesy.

51
00:04:55,535 --> 00:04:57,868
We are grateful for
your welcome.

52
00:04:57,968 --> 00:05:01,235
Okay, so just how much of
a big shot is he anyway?

53
00:05:01,335 --> 00:05:04,835
Sanzo isn't his name, Gojyo,
it's more a title he's
been given.

54
00:05:04,935 --> 00:05:08,768
There are five sacred scriptures
in the world called the Founding
of Heaven and Earth,

55
00:05:08,868 --> 00:05:14,068
and if I've got this right, the
title of Sanzo is one given to
the guardians of each of
these scriptures.

56
00:05:14,168 --> 00:05:16,768
Among those who hold to the
tenents of the Buddhist faith,

57
00:05:16,868 --> 00:05:19,402
they are revered as the most
holy of all monks.

58
00:05:19,502 --> 00:05:23,768
So the entire baldy
consortium has no clue
he's a complete dickhead.

59
00:05:23,868 --> 00:05:26,168
They're putting us up for the
night. Shut up.

60
00:05:26,268 --> 00:05:28,035
[Abbot] You know, Priest
Koumyou Sanzo

61
00:05:28,135 --> 00:05:32,935
also graced this temple with
his presence almost thirteen
years ago.

62
00:05:33,035 --> 00:05:36,402
His majesty was second only to
his humility.

63
00:05:36,502 --> 00:05:39,702
His presence is still fresh in
my memory.

64
00:05:39,802 --> 00:05:44,568
If I may say so, you greatly
resemble Master Koumyou.

65
00:05:44,668 --> 00:05:47,702
I heard news of Master
Koumyou's passing,

66
00:05:47,802 --> 00:05:51,002
shortly there after I learned
that his favorite student,

67
00:05:51,102 --> 00:05:56,668
had taken up his mantle, I am
pleased for you. Proud of you.

68
00:05:56,768 --> 00:06:00,835
Your praise is appreciated. It
would be too dangerous to pass
these mountains in the dark,

69
00:06:00,935 --> 00:06:03,635
so we are grateful you are
allowing us to stay the night.

70
00:06:03,735 --> 00:06:07,702
We would be happy to allow you
to stay, it's just...

71
00:06:07,802 --> 00:06:08,835
Just what?

72
00:06:08,935 --> 00:06:11,102
It's just that this temple
is sacred,

73
00:06:11,202 --> 00:06:14,502
and our order does not allow
outsiders to pass through
our doors.

74
00:06:14,602 --> 00:06:19,035
And these three gentlemen over
there hardly seem to be either
devout or contrite.

75
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:22,435
You'll let the monk stay, but
you're going to let us sleep
outside on the rocks?!

76
00:06:22,535 --> 00:06:24,902
I wouldn't stay here if you got
on your knees and begged me!

77
00:06:25,002 --> 00:06:26,168
[Hakkai] Speak for yourself.

78
00:06:26,268 --> 00:06:27,902
You can sleep where you want.

79
00:06:28,002 --> 00:06:29,968
I don't want to sleep on
the rocks.

80
00:06:30,068 --> 00:06:33,868
Remember that these monks are of
a very devout order, Gojyo.

81
00:06:33,968 --> 00:06:36,335
Yeah the order of
judgmental assholes.

82
00:06:36,435 --> 00:06:38,802
[Monk C] Are they your pupils
Genjo Sanzo?

83
00:06:38,902 --> 00:06:40,102
[Sanzo] No.

84
00:06:40,202 --> 00:06:41,402
They're my servants.

85
00:06:41,502 --> 00:06:44,335
[Gojyo and Goku throw a fit
about being called servants]

86
00:06:50,735 --> 00:06:53,568
You even think about touching my
plate, I'm going to cut your
hand off.

87
00:06:53,668 --> 00:06:55,202
I'm hungry and you've
got plenty!

88
00:06:55,302 --> 00:06:56,635
You try it, you die!

89
00:06:56,735 --> 00:06:57,935
[Hakkai] Will you knock it off?

90
00:07:01,635 --> 00:07:04,702
Man, those monks kick ass in
the kitchen!

91
00:07:04,802 --> 00:07:06,768
And the accomedations aren't
that bad either.

92
00:07:06,868 --> 00:07:11,035
My goodness, how will we ever
repay you for graciousness to
include us, your highness.

93
00:07:11,135 --> 00:07:13,135
I'm going to kill you.

94
00:07:13,235 --> 00:07:15,002
Have you found the room to
your liking?

95
00:07:17,668 --> 00:07:21,935
My name is Yo, and I have
been given the high honor of
attending to all your needs.

96
00:07:22,035 --> 00:07:24,302
Simply ask and I will provide
it for you.

97
00:07:24,402 --> 00:07:28,068
Dude, I seriously doubt you
could provide for any of
my needs.

98
00:07:28,168 --> 00:07:29,935
Not unless you got an
older sister.

99
00:07:30,035 --> 00:07:35,035
You better watch your mouth!
Women are positively forbidden
in this temple.

100
00:07:35,135 --> 00:07:37,002
Isn't that right, Master Sanzo?

101
00:07:37,868 --> 00:07:39,668
Why are you doing this to me?

102
00:07:39,768 --> 00:07:44,202
I have to confess, this is the
highest honor ever bestowed
upon me, Master Sanzo.

103
00:07:44,302 --> 00:07:48,002
I've never met a holy man
chosen by Buddha himself!

104
00:07:48,102 --> 00:07:52,368
It's men like you who are the
reason I've dedicated my life
to the Buddhist faith!

105
00:07:52,468 --> 00:07:54,868
I cannot tell you what this
moment means to me!

106
00:07:54,968 --> 00:07:59,502
I promise you, I will put my
heart and soul into making your
stay here a pleasant one!

107
00:07:59,602 --> 00:08:03,835
If there is anything you need
at all, Don't hesitate to call
my name. Really!

108
00:08:08,302 --> 00:08:10,102
You? A holy man!? Yeah right!

109
00:08:10,202 --> 00:08:13,902
[mockingly] "I cannot tell you
what this means to me! Do not
hesitate to call my name!"

110
00:08:14,002 --> 00:08:15,702
You know what this means,
don't you?

111
00:08:15,802 --> 00:08:17,468
[All three] He doesn't know you
very well.

112
00:08:22,968 --> 00:08:26,302
You guys, I'm still hungry!

113
00:08:26,402 --> 00:08:30,635
And I've got gas like you
wouldn't believe, all these
vegetables and beans. Blech.

114
00:08:30,735 --> 00:08:35,002
They're Buddhists so they're
vegetarians and if you think
about farting, I'll kill you.

115
00:08:35,102 --> 00:08:38,668
His farts would almost be better
than all this nasty incense.

116
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:40,868
You can all put up with it for
one night.

117
00:08:45,668 --> 00:08:48,235
Last piece... call.

118
00:08:48,335 --> 00:08:50,668
Call, all triple straights.

119
00:08:50,768 --> 00:08:52,768
What's going on? What are
you doing?!

120
00:08:52,868 --> 00:08:54,735
[All four] It's Mah-jongg!

121
00:08:54,835 --> 00:08:55,902
Damn it!

122
00:08:56,002 --> 00:08:57,635
So you were waiting for the
"five of wan" tile.

123
00:08:57,735 --> 00:09:00,235
[Yo] No drinking! No smoking!

124
00:09:06,535 --> 00:09:08,968
We are confiscating all
of this!

125
00:09:09,068 --> 00:09:09,735
Man...

126
00:09:09,835 --> 00:09:11,268
Do not "man" me!

127
00:09:11,368 --> 00:09:13,368
We are in a sacred temple!
Act like it!

128
00:09:13,468 --> 00:09:17,102
I don't understand how none of
you seem to know anything about
the ways of the Buddha!

129
00:09:17,202 --> 00:09:21,368
It's like each of you are asking
for Buddha's retribution to come
raining down on upon you!

130
00:09:21,468 --> 00:09:23,068
Just go to bed.

131
00:09:23,168 --> 00:09:25,835
[Goku] Sanzo, toss me the comics
when you're finished with the
paper, will ya?

132
00:09:25,935 --> 00:09:27,668
[Sanzo] Yeah, sure man,
no sweat.

133
00:09:27,768 --> 00:09:31,768
Aah! Are you guys even listening
to me?!

134
00:09:31,868 --> 00:09:32,935
[All three] Uh no.

135
00:09:37,335 --> 00:09:42,068
Tell me, has this temple
suffered from any unusual
demonic activity recently?

136
00:09:42,168 --> 00:09:43,968
No, of course not.

137
00:09:44,068 --> 00:09:46,568
It is said that by the Lord
Buddha's protection,

138
00:09:46,668 --> 00:09:49,402
this temple is warded from such
worldly things.

139
00:09:49,502 --> 00:09:53,635
Because our deep devotion has
been communicated to the
Lord Buddha.

140
00:09:53,735 --> 00:09:57,668
Well what are you gonna do if
they do attack you? What then,
Mini Monk?

141
00:09:57,768 --> 00:10:02,502
That would never happen in a
million years, but if it did
the Merciful Goddess would
protect us.

142
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:05,402
Right, but if she didn't you got
guns and shit right?

143
00:10:05,502 --> 00:10:10,102
Of course we don't, killing goes
against everything Buddha
stands for.

144
00:10:10,202 --> 00:10:12,035
Good god, kid, you're
killing me.

145
00:10:12,135 --> 00:10:14,568
Then that's all the more reason
we should probably keep

146
00:10:14,668 --> 00:10:17,202
the duration of our little visit
here short.

147
00:10:23,902 --> 00:10:27,868
[Goku] Beef, pork,
chicken, fish.

148
00:10:27,968 --> 00:10:32,968
[Gojyo] Women, liquor, smokes.

149
00:10:33,068 --> 00:10:35,335
Okay, you both are
just pathetic.

150
00:10:35,435 --> 00:10:36,702
Where's Sanzo?

151
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:40,102
Our little helper came and said
the Abbot wanted to see him.

152
00:10:40,202 --> 00:10:41,402
This late at night?

153
00:10:44,702 --> 00:10:45,835
What is it?

154
00:10:58,735 --> 00:11:00,502
I think we've got company.

155
00:11:01,635 --> 00:11:04,602
No way! Another assassin?!

156
00:11:04,702 --> 00:11:06,868
We'll be lucky if it's just one.

157
00:11:26,668 --> 00:11:31,368
Come out, come out where ever
you are, Genjo Sanzo!

158
00:11:31,468 --> 00:11:34,702
I have orders from Lord
Kougaiji himself.

159
00:11:35,902 --> 00:11:38,635
I have come to take your life!

160
00:11:52,104 --> 00:11:56,737
Oh my, I do so love the taste of
tender monk flesh.

161
00:11:57,404 --> 00:11:58,270
A demon!

162
00:11:58,370 --> 00:11:59,670
To temple!

163
00:12:16,137 --> 00:12:17,637
Do not panic!

164
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:21,037
Use the signs! Form the signs
and chant the scriptures!

165
00:12:21,137 --> 00:12:24,037
By the power of the Merciful
Goddess be gone demon!

166
00:12:24,137 --> 00:12:27,437
Your evil has no place in this
most holy of temple! Go!

167
00:12:27,537 --> 00:12:28,804
Now you die!

168
00:12:28,904 --> 00:12:29,937
We begin!

169
00:12:30,037 --> 00:12:33,170
[Monks chanting]

170
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:40,837
He dies. It's working!

171
00:12:44,437 --> 00:12:46,537
No, it's not!

172
00:12:46,637 --> 00:12:48,970
Your chanting is just noise
to me!

173
00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:50,337
You're pathetic!

174
00:12:58,937 --> 00:13:03,537
<i>Merciful Goddess please</i>
<i>save us! Please! Please!</i>

175
00:13:03,637 --> 00:13:06,004
Yes? Why did you call me here?

176
00:13:06,104 --> 00:13:08,637
Though we do not know your
plans Genjo Sanzo,

177
00:13:08,737 --> 00:13:13,137
we wish to ask you to consider
prolonging your stay here at
our temple.

178
00:13:13,237 --> 00:13:16,204
I'm afraid my journey is
urgency makes that impossible.

179
00:13:16,304 --> 00:13:20,104
[Priest B] For just a month,
please! A week at least! Sure
you can remain a week.

180
00:13:20,204 --> 00:13:23,270
Your visititation to this place
is a sign we have been
searching for,

181
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:27,837
and surely you yourself can feel
the hand of the lord Buddah in
bringing you here.

182
00:13:27,937 --> 00:13:32,804
It would be a great honor to
all of us if you would bless
us with your wise teaching,
Genjo Sanzo.

183
00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:37,470
Perhaps not. Tell me, did you
ask the same request

184
00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:39,470
of Koumyou Sanzo when he
came here?

185
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:44,937
We did, but disappointingly,
he did not comply with our
sincere request.

186
00:13:45,070 --> 00:13:48,370
I have the feeling you would
not have liked his sermons as
much as you think.

187
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:50,370
[Priest B] Why would you
say that?
[Priest C] Of course we would!

188
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:53,604
Perhaps you would like me to
deliver the message that
Koumyou Sanzo

189
00:13:53,704 --> 00:13:55,904
was too polite or forgiving
to give you?

190
00:13:57,870 --> 00:14:02,004
That all of you are spoiled,
and frankly you're a bunch of
old farts. There.

191
00:14:02,104 --> 00:14:04,104
How dare you address me
this way!

192
00:14:04,204 --> 00:14:07,304
[Priest B] Yes! Y-You go
too far!

193
00:14:07,404 --> 00:14:09,170
Great One, you must
come quickly!

194
00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:13,704
A demon has entered the temple
and demands we surrender Genjo
Sanzo and his companions,

195
00:14:13,804 --> 00:14:17,637
and he vows he will slay us all
until they are given to him!

196
00:14:17,770 --> 00:14:18,870
[Sanzo] What?!

197
00:14:22,704 --> 00:14:24,737
Come on, Genjo Sanzo!

198
00:14:24,837 --> 00:14:29,304
I've had my fill of monks and
I'm ready to move on to
tastier fair!

199
00:14:34,504 --> 00:14:39,737
Tell me child, do you have a
name selected? The one you will
take on in the after life?

200
00:14:41,270 --> 00:14:43,670
[Gojyo] Damn, this is a big
let down.

201
00:14:43,770 --> 00:14:47,404
I can't believe this is their
second try.

202
00:14:47,504 --> 00:14:52,470
I mean they might have sucked
but at least their first go
around was pretty to look at.

203
00:14:52,604 --> 00:14:56,304
I know you! You're the three
demons who have betrayed us!

204
00:14:56,404 --> 00:14:59,604
I'm going to enjoy tearing the
three of you apart!

205
00:14:59,704 --> 00:15:02,237
One at a time or all together!

206
00:15:02,337 --> 00:15:06,004
Yes! I'll even let you decide
the order in which you all die!

207
00:15:06,104 --> 00:15:07,904
[Axe Demon laughs]

208
00:15:08,004 --> 00:15:09,704
So, what do you think, Goku?

209
00:15:09,804 --> 00:15:13,404
Seems like an asshole and he's
got bad hair. I say -20 points.

210
00:15:13,504 --> 00:15:16,837
Take off another 15. His clothes
are lame and he smells.

211
00:15:18,404 --> 00:15:21,204
How dare you! How dare you
mock me!

212
00:15:21,304 --> 00:15:24,470
Aw dude, bad teeth take off
another 5!

213
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:30,837
Bad aim, that's another 10.

214
00:15:39,570 --> 00:15:43,337
<i>No! They're fast!</i>
<i>This is impossible!</i>

215
00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:50,537
<i>They are no ordinary demons!</i>

216
00:15:50,637 --> 00:15:52,637
Okay, that didn't take any time
at all!

217
00:15:52,737 --> 00:15:55,604
Maybe this is just his way of
making us think he's got
us whipped

218
00:15:55,704 --> 00:15:58,570
before he brings out the
big guns.

219
00:15:58,670 --> 00:16:00,770
How very perceptive of you.

220
00:16:06,437 --> 00:16:07,570
[Hakkai] Oh please.

221
00:16:09,370 --> 00:16:11,870
Oh, he resists me!

222
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:14,437
[Goku] You're getting the hang
of this!

223
00:16:14,537 --> 00:16:19,370
Yeah, I kinda thought of it
when taking out that little
spider lady the other day.

224
00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:23,537
Materialize a little chi. Make a
barrier wall. Not bad, eh?

225
00:16:23,637 --> 00:16:27,737
<i>His powers are immense!</i>
<i>I was not told!</i>

226
00:16:27,837 --> 00:16:31,070
Awesome! Come on dude, hook me
up with a few tricks like that,
will ya?

227
00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:35,170
You have to be able to
concentrate, and that's
not really your strong suit.

228
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:38,704
<i>These demons still wear their</i>
<i>power limiters!</i>

229
00:16:38,804 --> 00:16:43,204
<i>What would happen if they took</i>
<i>those chains of magic off?!</i>

230
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:46,937
Let's find out!

231
00:16:47,037 --> 00:16:51,504
Why don't I show my demon
brethren the true extent
of my powers?

232
00:16:55,704 --> 00:16:59,304
So that's why his little
ensemble is missing the
right sleeve.

233
00:16:59,404 --> 00:17:02,737
And I thought it was just a
really bad fashion statement.

234
00:17:02,837 --> 00:17:05,970
And that will be the last
statement you'll ever make!

235
00:17:06,070 --> 00:17:07,570
We'll see about that!

236
00:17:13,570 --> 00:17:15,770
He's strong. Strong as
he smells.

237
00:17:15,870 --> 00:17:18,237
And that's saying something,
coming from you.

238
00:17:18,337 --> 00:17:21,737
You'll never win! So you can die
now or later.

239
00:17:29,037 --> 00:17:32,470
And you're not all that bright
either. Take away another 45.

240
00:17:32,570 --> 00:17:33,737
Nice shot!

241
00:17:33,837 --> 00:17:37,437
With that many point he's
definitley out of the game.

242
00:17:37,537 --> 00:17:41,237
You know, your penchant for
dramatic entrances is getting
kinda obvious.

243
00:17:41,337 --> 00:17:44,504
I could've taken care him all by
myself, thank you very much.

244
00:17:44,604 --> 00:17:46,204
Of this I'm sure.

245
00:17:47,604 --> 00:17:50,370
If you're an example of the
caliber of assasins he's sending

246
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:56,237
this Lord Kougaiji of yours,
well he must painfully
underestimate our potential.

247
00:17:56,337 --> 00:17:59,270
What is the real purpose of the
experiments to revive Gyumaoh?

248
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:01,704
Tell me who is behind all
of this?

249
00:18:01,804 --> 00:18:04,370
You. You stink of human blood.

250
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:07,437
How many people's blood have you
been splattered with?

251
00:18:07,537 --> 00:18:09,870
You shame your own faith!

252
00:18:09,970 --> 00:18:13,770
For that, I'm taking another 20.
And that's it game over.

253
00:18:13,870 --> 00:18:16,137
I don't think so.

254
00:18:16,237 --> 00:18:17,837
I've got another hand!

255
00:18:22,104 --> 00:18:23,437
By the powers of heaven...

256
00:18:23,537 --> 00:18:24,904
Be gone!

257
00:18:34,170 --> 00:18:36,604
You only get one
continue, buddy.

258
00:18:46,641 --> 00:18:50,741
[Hakkai] So there you are!
Are you okay? Are you hurt.

259
00:18:50,741 --> 00:18:53,008
Who- Who are you people?

260
00:18:57,808 --> 00:19:00,574
I heard it say you've been
splattered by the blood of many!

261
00:19:00,674 --> 00:19:04,941
If you've killed so many how are
you better than any demon?

262
00:19:05,041 --> 00:19:07,508
[Goku] Look you stupid little
jerk, if we wouldn't have
stopped him

263
00:19:07,608 --> 00:19:09,974
he would have eaten your happy
ass too.

264
00:19:10,074 --> 00:19:13,608
[Hakkai] We don't want to kill,
but I'm afraid they leave us
little choice.

265
00:19:13,708 --> 00:19:15,774
But you always have a choice!

266
00:19:15,874 --> 00:19:18,374
The act of taking a life, no
matter whose live it is,

267
00:19:18,474 --> 00:19:20,874
is blasphemy against the
teachings of the Lord Buddha!

268
00:19:20,974 --> 00:19:24,841
Tell me, do you really believe
what you're saying?

269
00:19:24,941 --> 00:19:28,874
Do you still mean that after
you've just seen the slaughter
of your own brothers?

270
00:19:30,808 --> 00:19:34,608
If you want to be so close to
the gods so badly perhaps you
should join them.

271
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:39,274
Everyone becomes closer to
Buddha when they stop breathing.

272
00:19:39,374 --> 00:19:41,774
It's harder to be close while
you still are.

273
00:19:45,374 --> 00:19:47,341
You're right.

274
00:19:47,441 --> 00:19:50,041
You're alive. Think about
that, kid.

275
00:19:54,274 --> 00:19:57,741
We're all alive for a reason.
Find out why.

276
00:20:16,741 --> 00:20:17,808
What is it?

277
00:20:17,908 --> 00:20:19,974
Master, when you and your
friends come this way

278
00:20:20,074 --> 00:20:21,441
after your journey is over,

279
00:20:21,541 --> 00:20:23,708
would you come visit our
emple again?

280
00:20:23,808 --> 00:20:26,908
Because I'd... Because I'd
really like you teach me

281
00:20:27,008 --> 00:20:29,908
how to play mah-jongg, if you
would please.

282
00:20:30,008 --> 00:20:31,674
I'd like that very much.

283
00:20:38,308 --> 00:20:41,774
<i>Bless them on their journey,</i>
<i>Lord Buddah. Bless them.</i>

284
00:22:27,941 --> 00:22:32,041
[Goku] Does the name Jien mean
anything to you? No? Well,
me neither.

285
00:22:32,141 --> 00:22:35,341
But apparently to Gojyo and
this chick who really gets
off doing laundry

286
00:22:35,441 --> 00:22:39,174
that name means a lot. What, you
ask? Hell, I don't know.

287
00:22:39,274 --> 00:22:41,074
They don't tell me nothing
around here.

288
00:22:41,174 --> 00:22:45,208
All I know is this need-to-know
basis for old Goku's getting on
my nerves!

289
00:22:45,308 --> 00:22:46,774
[Gojyo] God, dude, quit
your whining.

290
00:22:46,874 --> 00:22:48,408
[Goku] I'm not whining!

291
00:22:48,508 --> 00:22:51,008
Stay tuned for "Crimson Tears."
