1
00:01:40,328 --> 00:01:43,762
[Elder] It is an age of
suffering and dispair.

2
00:01:43,862 --> 00:01:47,595
Demons appear out of the
darkness to terrorize the land.

3
00:01:47,695 --> 00:01:53,095
And people search for escape,
as the Earth plunges into chaos.

4
00:01:53,195 --> 00:02:00,262
But just when all hope appears
to be lost, a single shaft of
light shines from the East,

5
00:02:00,395 --> 00:02:06,762
and a young man appears with a
holy scripture draped around
his shoulders as a vestment

6
00:02:06,862 --> 00:02:10,395
and s crimson chakra upon
his brow.

7
00:02:10,495 --> 00:02:15,128
With three friends at his side,
he combats demons.

8
00:02:15,228 --> 00:02:18,962
And fights to restore
tranquility to this world.

9
00:02:23,695 --> 00:02:28,828
This is an ancient legend passed
down through the ages.

10
00:02:28,928 --> 00:02:31,828
[Kid A] What is the
savior's name?

11
00:02:31,928 --> 00:02:36,628
The name of the man is
Priest Sanzo.

12
00:02:36,728 --> 00:02:37,828
Sanzo?

13
00:02:37,928 --> 00:02:40,828
He is the one who read from the
holy scripture

14
00:02:40,928 --> 00:02:47,295
that defeated the demons
plaguing the villagers,
those many years ago.

15
00:02:49,428 --> 00:02:54,695
Do you think maybe- Do you think
the man might ever come to our
village again?

16
00:02:54,795 --> 00:03:01,062
If our village were ever to fall
into trouble anew, I have a
feeling he will return.

17
00:03:07,928 --> 00:03:10,528
[Fake Hakkai] They're like puddy
in our hands.

18
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:16,562
"Fake Saviors"

19
00:03:22,495 --> 00:03:24,595
[Goku] Sanzo, I'm hungry!

20
00:03:24,695 --> 00:03:30,262
[Gojyo] Day in and day out,
it's always the same thing,
"I'm hungry, I'm hungry."

21
00:03:30,362 --> 00:03:32,928
Can't you say anything else, you
one trick monkey?

22
00:03:33,028 --> 00:03:34,862
Hey you lay off, long hair!

23
00:03:34,962 --> 00:03:38,762
At least I don't have a grotto
for brains, you sissy
water sprite!

24
00:03:38,862 --> 00:03:41,728
Grotto, huh? That's a pretty big
word for a monkey!

25
00:03:41,828 --> 00:03:44,128
I bet you don't even know what
it means.

26
00:03:44,228 --> 00:03:46,428
[Goku] I do too know what
it means!

27
00:03:46,528 --> 00:03:51,028
Oh, really? Then let's hear it.
Well? Come on.

28
00:03:52,662 --> 00:03:54,028
I'm listening.

29
00:03:55,395 --> 00:03:57,128
Sanzo...

30
00:03:57,228 --> 00:03:59,028
Please, just kill me.

31
00:03:59,128 --> 00:04:01,462
What? What are you doing? Are
you saying something behind
my back?

32
00:04:01,562 --> 00:04:02,795
[Sanzo] I'm staying out of this.

33
00:04:02,895 --> 00:04:07,028
[Goku] But Sazno! You said Gojyo
had a brain like a grotto.

34
00:04:07,128 --> 00:04:08,928
[Gojyo] And you call yourself
a monk.

35
00:04:09,028 --> 00:04:11,395
[Sanzo] I meant it in the nicest
possible way.
[Hakkai] Hey we're coming up
on village.

36
00:04:11,495 --> 00:04:14,195
[Hakkai] So could you be on your
best behavior? Please?
[Goku] and so when you called
him a troglodyte, that meant...

37
00:04:14,295 --> 00:04:15,962
[Gojyo] That does it!
Now I'm angry!

38
00:04:16,062 --> 00:04:18,862
[Goku and Gojyo fighting]

39
00:04:23,862 --> 00:04:27,962
[Goku] Food, food! Every where
I look it's food!

40
00:04:28,062 --> 00:04:30,628
[Goku] I'm gonna eat that
and that!
[Hakkai] We ought to be able to
find a place

41
00:04:30,728 --> 00:04:32,928
[Goku] And that! And that!
[Hakkai] to sleep around here
no problem.

42
00:04:33,028 --> 00:04:36,628
And then it's just a matter of
finding someone to sleep
around with.

43
00:04:37,495 --> 00:04:38,628
[Kid] Ow!

44
00:04:40,562 --> 00:04:45,528
I'm sorry. We were just playing
tag and I guess I just
fell dow-...

45
00:04:45,628 --> 00:04:49,662
[Hakkai] Are you okay? You know,
you should really be careful.

46
00:04:49,762 --> 00:04:54,062
<i>He's dressed in white, with a</i>
<i>scripture draped around</i>
<i>his shoulders...</i>

47
00:04:54,162 --> 00:04:56,262
<i>And clear, blue eyes...</i>

48
00:04:57,495 --> 00:05:00,628
Oh my god! You're Priest Sanzo!

49
00:05:14,162 --> 00:05:16,028
[Cheif] Quiet everyone.

50
00:05:16,128 --> 00:05:22,695
Oh Priest Sanzo, I can't tell
you how pleased we are that you
came back to you humble village.

51
00:05:22,795 --> 00:05:26,095
[Hakkai] Excuse me, I'm sorry,
but what are you talking about?

52
00:05:26,195 --> 00:05:28,228
Oh yes, uh let me explain.

53
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:32,162
It was your friend Sanzo who
came to save our village,
let's see uh...

54
00:05:32,862 --> 00:05:35,628
Some four hundred years ago.

55
00:05:35,728 --> 00:05:39,228
And now to our great delight,
he has returned.

56
00:05:39,328 --> 00:05:42,428
You honor us with your presence.

57
00:05:42,528 --> 00:05:45,962
That's funny, I would have
guessed you were much younger
than that.

58
00:05:46,062 --> 00:05:48,028
That's because I am.

59
00:05:48,128 --> 00:05:52,528
The name Sanzo has been passed
down from generation to
generation, Goku.

60
00:05:52,628 --> 00:05:56,095
We were not able to thank Priest
Sanzo properly back then,

61
00:05:56,195 --> 00:06:00,495
and we vowed that we would make
it up to him if he ever returned
to our village.

62
00:06:00,595 --> 00:06:04,862
So please, anything our people
can offer you is yours.

63
00:06:04,962 --> 00:06:08,162
I see. I understand
your gratitude.

64
00:06:08,262 --> 00:06:09,328
Well then...

65
00:06:09,428 --> 00:06:11,828
But, while this all very kind
of you-

66
00:06:11,928 --> 00:06:14,728
The Great Sanzo says he
welcomes your hospitality.

67
00:06:14,828 --> 00:06:17,595
And the priest is
awfully hungry!

68
00:06:17,695 --> 00:06:19,095
[muffled] Greedy bastards.

69
00:06:19,862 --> 00:06:22,028
Yes, why of course, sir.

70
00:06:22,128 --> 00:06:23,428
[Goku & Gojyo] Hold it!

71
00:06:23,528 --> 00:06:24,828
Uh is there more?

72
00:06:24,928 --> 00:06:27,795
Sanzo wants steak and plenty
of alcohol!

73
00:06:27,928 --> 00:06:31,262
And to be waited on by pretty
young virgin maidens. Oh yeah.

74
00:06:31,362 --> 00:06:35,362
Oh, and seems to be asking for a
nice warm bed too.

75
00:06:35,462 --> 00:06:36,862
[Sanzo] [muffled] I'll
kill them!

76
00:06:36,962 --> 00:06:39,662
[Chief] Of course, we will take
care of it right away.

77
00:06:47,595 --> 00:06:50,162
Boy, you really look upset.

78
00:06:50,262 --> 00:06:56,095
Relax. Think of all the guilt
these people no longer have to
live with for not having
thanked you properly.

79
00:06:56,195 --> 00:06:57,495
[Sanzo] Damn narcissists.

80
00:06:57,595 --> 00:07:01,295
Sure, this is nice for a while
but then there's the aftermath.

81
00:07:01,428 --> 00:07:03,495
Oh such as?

82
00:07:03,595 --> 00:07:07,395
[Sanzo] The nagging. The begging
for me to give them advice and
counsel them,

83
00:07:07,495 --> 00:07:10,695
all for a measley meal and a
decent night's rest.

84
00:07:13,528 --> 00:07:17,495
Sure, that's bad for you, but I
fail to see the downside for
the rest of us.

85
00:07:17,595 --> 00:07:19,028
[Door opens]

86
00:07:19,128 --> 00:07:24,495
Hey! Listen up, imposters, your
little charade is finished!

87
00:07:24,595 --> 00:07:30,828
Stop this silly game of yours,
because the real and authentic
Sanzo party has arrived!

88
00:07:32,928 --> 00:07:34,062
[Fake Hakkai] Well?!

89
00:07:35,728 --> 00:07:37,795
[All three laugh]

90
00:07:37,895 --> 00:07:39,362
Hey stop laughing!

91
00:07:39,462 --> 00:07:41,762
Do you have any idea who
this is?!

92
00:07:41,862 --> 00:07:44,695
It's none other than the famous
and legendary Sanzo!

93
00:07:44,795 --> 00:07:45,762
Show some respect!

94
00:07:45,862 --> 00:07:49,762
[Laughter continues]

95
00:07:49,862 --> 00:07:55,095
I can't breathe! Make them stop!
Make them stop!

96
00:07:55,195 --> 00:07:59,495
Will you get a load of this guy?
He's hilarious!

97
00:08:00,662 --> 00:08:03,128
Look two Hakkai's but
three chins.

98
00:08:05,028 --> 00:08:08,395
I don't know, this one looks
more like a princess than
a priest.

99
00:08:10,762 --> 00:08:15,395
Stop making fun of us you fakes!
You're the real imposters!

100
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:18,328
Excuse me? Who's the half-
assed knockoff?

101
00:08:18,428 --> 00:08:20,862
Alright, let's see who's
the fake!

102
00:08:20,962 --> 00:08:22,162
[Sanzo] Don't!

103
00:08:22,262 --> 00:08:24,328
It's not worth the effort,
my friend.

104
00:08:26,528 --> 00:08:31,162
I-I- don't understand. Wh-What
the hell's going on in here?

105
00:08:31,262 --> 00:08:32,895
Two Sanzos?

106
00:08:37,995 --> 00:08:39,495
What just happened?

107
00:08:39,595 --> 00:08:43,762
Well, apparently it looks we
didn't do a very good job of
being ourselves.

108
00:08:43,862 --> 00:08:46,228
I didn't even get my dinner.

109
00:08:46,328 --> 00:08:50,428
At least they won't be pestering
me to solve all of their
problems for them.

110
00:08:50,528 --> 00:08:53,262
Come on! You just can't admit
you're the one who screwed
this up.

111
00:08:53,362 --> 00:08:54,828
This is your fault!

112
00:08:54,928 --> 00:08:56,162
Say that again.

113
00:08:56,262 --> 00:08:59,862
Calm down! I mean what's the use
in fighting about it now?

114
00:08:59,962 --> 00:09:03,262
At least we have beds to
sleep on.

115
00:09:03,362 --> 00:09:04,495
[All three] Beds huh?

116
00:09:10,362 --> 00:09:14,595
[Cheif] I am so sorry. Those
imposters nearly fooled us.

117
00:09:14,728 --> 00:09:18,795
How we could have mistaken
such a sorry lot for you
fine gentlemen,

118
00:09:18,895 --> 00:09:21,862
it simply defies all
explination.

119
00:09:21,962 --> 00:09:24,695
We will execute them imediatly
for their crimes!

120
00:09:27,795 --> 00:09:30,228
Oh, no, that's not necessary.

121
00:09:30,328 --> 00:09:33,595
It happens all the time, you
wouldn't believe.

122
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:37,228
My goodness, Priest Sanzo,
that's so forgiving.

123
00:09:37,328 --> 00:09:41,162
I sure wish those charlatans
could witness your fine
generostiy.

124
00:09:41,262 --> 00:09:43,128
[stomach growls]

125
00:09:43,228 --> 00:09:46,262
[quietly] Geeze! Can't you put
a lid on that stomach of yours?

126
00:09:46,362 --> 00:09:48,928
You'll blow our cover!

127
00:09:49,028 --> 00:09:53,228
You know, it might be a good
idea to pick it up a bit.
Cut to the chase.

128
00:09:53,328 --> 00:09:55,995
[quietly] Mhm, got it.
[Clears throat]

129
00:09:56,095 --> 00:10:01,295
Chief, considering the long and
difficult journey my comrades
and I have embarked on...

130
00:10:01,395 --> 00:10:02,362
I was wondering.

131
00:10:02,462 --> 00:10:04,762
Oh, yes of course!

132
00:10:04,862 --> 00:10:08,795
We have prepared the ultimate
feast in honor of your arrival.

133
00:10:08,895 --> 00:10:11,495
If you can be patient.

134
00:10:11,595 --> 00:10:15,262
Yes, of course. No problem.
Take your time.

135
00:10:17,262 --> 00:10:21,728
You've got to admit it. Those
guys got us pretty good though,
eh fellas?

136
00:10:21,862 --> 00:10:25,162
[Hakkai] I never would have
thought we were worth
impersonating.

137
00:10:25,262 --> 00:10:29,062
Hey, Sanzo, I'm hungry.

138
00:10:29,162 --> 00:10:31,128
How would you like to eat dirt?

139
00:10:31,228 --> 00:10:32,895
All right, knock it off!

140
00:10:32,995 --> 00:10:37,228
Hey, buddy, I don't suppose you
could slip me something to
eat here.

141
00:10:37,328 --> 00:10:40,695
You know you make a lot of
demands for a criminal. Shut up!

142
00:10:40,795 --> 00:10:44,262
I promise I'll be quiet just as
soon as you bring me something
to eat.

143
00:10:44,362 --> 00:10:48,962
What do you think this is?
A hotel? I wouldn't feed
you if I had any food!

144
00:10:49,062 --> 00:10:52,895
Okay. In that case, I'll just
get it myself.

145
00:10:52,995 --> 00:10:54,795
Now that I'd like to see.

146
00:10:54,928 --> 00:10:57,228
Do you have any idea who you're
messing with?

147
00:10:59,095 --> 00:11:01,395
[Goku] Food... Food!

148
00:11:04,162 --> 00:11:06,928
[Guard screams]

149
00:11:07,028 --> 00:11:09,695
Nah-ah-ah-ah. Not so fast.

150
00:11:09,795 --> 00:11:13,762
Honestly how do you expect to
keep an eye on us if you're
running off like that?

151
00:11:13,862 --> 00:11:14,995
[Guard continues screaming]

152
00:11:18,862 --> 00:11:20,462
[Gojyo] Let's see now.

153
00:11:22,562 --> 00:11:25,128
[screams]

154
00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:36,086
[Gojyo] Guard! Does this look
empty to you?

155
00:11:36,186 --> 00:11:37,719
[Guard] Coming, sir!

156
00:11:40,086 --> 00:11:41,519
The sake's not bad.

157
00:11:45,486 --> 00:11:46,452
Where's my beer?

158
00:11:46,552 --> 00:11:47,652
Right here, Sir!

159
00:12:04,186 --> 00:12:05,586
Hey, what is this?

160
00:12:05,686 --> 00:12:10,052
As you can see, a vegetarian
meal fit for a king.

161
00:12:10,152 --> 00:12:13,352
<i>It looks like it's more fit</i>
<i>for rabbits.</i>

162
00:12:13,452 --> 00:12:17,419
What is this? I've had hors
dourves that are more
filling than this.

163
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:21,186
[Chief] Our village is renown
for its vegetarian cuisine,

164
00:12:21,286 --> 00:12:24,986
and what you have before you is
the finest we have to offer.

165
00:12:25,086 --> 00:12:28,086
Oh, oh my. How very kind of you.

166
00:12:37,952 --> 00:12:42,686
Oh my god! I'm already hungry
again! I thought they'd never
let me stop lecturing.

167
00:12:42,786 --> 00:12:45,086
I've never made up so much
philosophy in my life!

168
00:12:45,186 --> 00:12:48,719
Well we wouldn't eat at all if
we didn't have that famous guy
to imitate.

169
00:12:48,819 --> 00:12:50,486
Consider yourself lucky.

170
00:12:50,586 --> 00:12:53,152
Oh boy, ain't that the truth.

171
00:12:53,252 --> 00:12:55,552
[Fake Hakkai] Could you believe
the nerve of those other guys?

172
00:12:55,652 --> 00:12:57,786
I know! Who were they trying
to fool?

173
00:12:57,886 --> 00:12:59,686
Oh boy! No kidding!

174
00:12:59,786 --> 00:13:02,086
Those were the worst imposters
I've ever seen.

175
00:13:02,186 --> 00:13:04,552
Absolutely no grace or dignity.

176
00:13:04,652 --> 00:13:11,119
By the way, has it every occured
to you guys that this might be
the real Sanzo party?

177
00:13:11,219 --> 00:13:12,652
No way!

178
00:13:12,752 --> 00:13:14,852
It never occured to me either!

179
00:13:14,952 --> 00:13:17,819
[All laugh]

180
00:13:30,286 --> 00:13:31,952
[Fake Sanzo] I say we
leave soon.

181
00:13:32,052 --> 00:13:35,652
[Fake Hakkai] Yeah I can't eat
another morsel of this
vegetarian crap.

182
00:13:35,752 --> 00:13:36,952
[Fake Goku] You got that right.

183
00:13:37,052 --> 00:13:38,086
[Akatsuki] Not so fast!

184
00:13:38,186 --> 00:13:40,652
[All four] What? Who? Huh?

185
00:13:40,752 --> 00:13:44,086
[Akatsuki] I have a matter of
some importance to discuss
with you.

186
00:13:44,186 --> 00:13:46,452
Wait! That's a demon!

187
00:13:46,552 --> 00:13:48,219
That's not possible!

188
00:13:51,119 --> 00:13:53,186
Oh it's very possible.

189
00:14:07,419 --> 00:14:08,719
[Hakkai] Heads up.

190
00:14:08,819 --> 00:14:11,752
Looks like we've got another
assassin in our midst,
gentlemen.

191
00:14:14,052 --> 00:14:15,952
[Gojyo] Hey Goku, wake up.

192
00:14:17,586 --> 00:14:19,286
Breakfast already?

193
00:14:19,852 --> 00:14:21,552
It's comeing!

194
00:14:21,652 --> 00:14:24,519
Oh nice, you ordered out
this time.

195
00:14:29,619 --> 00:14:32,352
Oh god not another one!

196
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:39,252
You know, these guys are looking
a little blue in the face.

197
00:14:45,219 --> 00:14:47,919
Looks like these are the guys
that are after us.

198
00:14:48,019 --> 00:14:49,719
I'm quaking in my boots.

199
00:14:52,652 --> 00:14:54,086
[Gojyo] Wake up!

200
00:14:58,752 --> 00:15:01,552
They sure move awfully fast for
fakes, don't they?

201
00:15:01,652 --> 00:15:05,286
Someone's manipulating our
little impersonators from
somewhere else.

202
00:15:06,319 --> 00:15:08,652
Time for our morning exercise.

203
00:15:11,152 --> 00:15:13,352
Elder! We've got trouble!

204
00:15:13,452 --> 00:15:15,786
What now? Can't you see
I'm busy.

205
00:15:15,886 --> 00:15:19,919
I'm in the middle of chanting
holy scriptures.

206
00:15:29,119 --> 00:15:30,686
So, what's the plan?

207
00:15:30,786 --> 00:15:34,319
They may be being manipulated,
but they're still human beings.

208
00:15:34,419 --> 00:15:36,252
And we should probably go easy
on them.

209
00:15:38,152 --> 00:15:39,519
What? What's the matter?

210
00:15:39,619 --> 00:15:41,719
[Gojyo] Goku, you stand back.

211
00:15:41,819 --> 00:15:43,152
How come?

212
00:15:43,252 --> 00:15:46,686
Because you can't go easy on
anybody, can ya?

213
00:15:46,786 --> 00:15:50,219
This is no time for chitchat,
now is it?

214
00:15:50,319 --> 00:15:53,752
You're all as good as dead
anyways! So get ready to die!

215
00:15:55,019 --> 00:15:56,419
Aw shit!

216
00:16:03,319 --> 00:16:04,852
What is this?

217
00:16:11,952 --> 00:16:15,219
Master Sanzo is fighting
Master Sanzo!

218
00:16:15,319 --> 00:16:17,419
And he's pretty good at it too.

219
00:16:19,919 --> 00:16:22,186
Man, these guys aren't
push overs.

220
00:16:25,086 --> 00:16:28,686
Whoever's controling them must
have an enormus amount of power.

221
00:16:28,786 --> 00:16:32,919
If this drags on the strain will
eventualy destroy their
human hosts.

222
00:16:37,286 --> 00:16:39,419
Damn, then what're we supposed
to do?

223
00:16:40,486 --> 00:16:41,752
What do you think?

224
00:16:43,086 --> 00:16:45,786
Knock them out so he can't
control them anymore.

225
00:16:59,152 --> 00:17:01,186
The bigger they are the harder
they fall.

226
00:17:06,219 --> 00:17:07,486
That everyone?

227
00:17:07,586 --> 00:17:08,619
We got four!

228
00:17:08,719 --> 00:17:10,986
Yep, that was a pretty
good workout.

229
00:17:11,086 --> 00:17:13,252
We'll let Sanzo do the cleaning
up part.

230
00:17:21,286 --> 00:17:24,419
Good grief, that sure didn't
last very long.

231
00:17:24,519 --> 00:17:28,386
Oh well, I didn't care much
which side ended up dead anyway.

232
00:17:28,486 --> 00:17:30,252
[Sanzo] They're all
enemies, right?

233
00:17:30,352 --> 00:17:33,319
Yes, it's so much simpler to
have them killing each other

234
00:17:33,452 --> 00:17:35,619
rather than messing with
them yourself.

235
00:17:35,719 --> 00:17:37,052
What the?!

236
00:17:37,152 --> 00:17:39,486
Sanzo?! How did you find me?!

237
00:17:39,586 --> 00:17:41,119
What are you, a moron?

238
00:17:41,219 --> 00:17:44,786
Someone had to be using their
powers to manipulate them.

239
00:17:44,886 --> 00:17:47,452
All I had to do was follow
the smell.

240
00:17:48,219 --> 00:17:49,919
Very good, Sanzo,

241
00:17:50,019 --> 00:17:52,852
but now, how good are your
other senses?!

242
00:17:55,752 --> 00:17:58,419
Aw, Sanzo's just showing off.

243
00:17:58,519 --> 00:17:59,652
Good luck up there!

244
00:18:00,719 --> 00:18:02,319
You are a moron.

245
00:18:03,719 --> 00:18:05,419
Now you're asking for it!

246
00:18:05,519 --> 00:18:07,686
Sanzo, your life is mine!

247
00:18:16,552 --> 00:18:19,852
By the dawn of day, I use your
light to propel the darkness,

248
00:18:19,952 --> 00:18:21,686
the sun rises, the night falls

249
00:18:21,786 --> 00:18:22,619
holy scripture...

250
00:18:22,719 --> 00:18:24,619
Send him back!

251
00:18:31,152 --> 00:18:32,086
Hey look!

252
00:18:32,186 --> 00:18:34,419
It is the true savior!

253
00:18:34,519 --> 00:18:37,486
Exactly as the legend describes.

254
00:18:37,586 --> 00:18:39,886
It's him! It's really him!

255
00:18:39,986 --> 00:18:44,652
[Elder] Yes, there can be no
doubt, it is Sanzo!

256
00:18:59,921 --> 00:19:03,121
Every inch of my body feels like
it's burning.

257
00:19:03,121 --> 00:19:05,188
I feel like hell.

258
00:19:05,288 --> 00:19:08,421
Oh god does my head hurt.

259
00:19:10,821 --> 00:19:14,388
How do you like fighting real
demons, you fake bastards?

260
00:19:14,488 --> 00:19:17,155
Boy, you guys got a long way to
go to be like us.

261
00:19:17,255 --> 00:19:20,121
Being a member of the
Sanzo party can get a
little dangerous,

262
00:19:20,221 --> 00:19:22,321
so I would advise finding
other work.

263
00:19:23,221 --> 00:19:25,055
[Sanzo] Well fellas.

264
00:19:25,155 --> 00:19:27,788
W-What is it, sir?

265
00:19:27,888 --> 00:19:30,721
Dress up day is over, now get
the hell out of here.

266
00:19:30,821 --> 00:19:33,588
[Both] Yes, Sir!

267
00:19:33,688 --> 00:19:35,155
[Fake Goku] Wait for me!
[Fake Hakkai] Don't leave me!

268
00:19:35,255 --> 00:19:40,755
Yet again, Master Sanzo has
saved our village from the
demon threat.

269
00:19:40,855 --> 00:19:44,321
It's not like we went out of
our way to save you guys.

270
00:19:44,421 --> 00:19:48,155
To be honest, we only fought
them for our own personal
reasons.

271
00:19:48,255 --> 00:19:51,055
Still you are worthy of
our admiration.

272
00:19:51,155 --> 00:19:56,721
You must have worked quite hard
to develope those abilities we
all witnessed here.

273
00:19:56,821 --> 00:19:58,055
Are you kidding?

274
00:19:59,921 --> 00:20:03,255
I hate hard work more than
anything in the world.

275
00:20:03,355 --> 00:20:05,421
I will never forget this.

276
00:20:05,521 --> 00:20:08,088
Those bastards sure made fools
out of us!

277
00:20:09,388 --> 00:20:12,221
Hey who the hell are you guys?

278
00:20:12,321 --> 00:20:14,555
I was just about to ask you the
same thing.

279
00:20:14,655 --> 00:20:18,655
Don't you recognize the great
Master Sanzo when you
see him?

280
00:20:18,755 --> 00:20:20,888
You should show some respect you
stupid, jerk!

281
00:20:20,988 --> 00:20:26,155
Surely you've heard of us.
Our powers are the stuff
of legends.

282
00:20:26,255 --> 00:20:29,055
Really? YOU'RE the Sanzo Party?

283
00:20:30,855 --> 00:20:32,688
Well that didn't take long,
let's go.

284
00:20:36,221 --> 00:20:38,355
[Fake Goku] Let's not dress like
this anymore.

285
00:20:38,455 --> 00:20:39,455
[Fake Sanzo] I agree...

286
00:20:39,555 --> 00:20:41,621
[Fake Goku] Nothing good
ever happens to us.

287
00:20:42,321 --> 00:20:43,455
[Fake Gojyo] No kidding.

288
00:22:27,555 --> 00:22:33,988
[Goku] A mysterious mechanical
doll suddenly appears out of
nowhere and fires a beam that
wounds Gojyo

289
00:22:34,088 --> 00:22:39,055
Now, something's moving inside
his body! What the hell is that
thing, anyway?

290
00:22:39,155 --> 00:22:44,055
Wait, Sanzo, what are youdoing?
But if you do that, what'll
happen to Gojyo?

291
00:22:44,155 --> 00:22:48,588
Find out next time in
"The Laughing Grim Reaper,"
on Saiyuki.

292
00:22:48,688 --> 00:22:49,821
Don't miss it!
