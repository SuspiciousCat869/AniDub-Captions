1
00:01:55,447 --> 00:01:58,908
[Sanzo] You know, I have
to admit I'm really not
up for this today.

2
00:01:58,908 --> 00:02:02,208
[Hakkai] You'd think they'd
realize it's pointless by now.

3
00:02:02,308 --> 00:02:04,774
[Demons growling]

4
00:02:04,874 --> 00:02:06,908
[Gojyo] Maybe we could
make a game out of it.

5
00:02:07,008 --> 00:02:09,608
Help hold our interest
a little bit.

6
00:02:09,708 --> 00:02:13,341
[Sanzo] I bet I could knock out
the next wave before they
reach the halfway mark.

7
00:02:13,441 --> 00:02:16,741
I never knew you had a
playful side to you, monk.

8
00:02:17,508 --> 00:02:19,141
[Demons yell and growl]

9
00:02:31,741 --> 00:02:34,041
That's a good way
to relieve stress.

10
00:02:34,674 --> 00:02:36,374
You need that, too.

11
00:02:36,474 --> 00:02:39,474
[Hakkai chuckles]
What's keeping Goku anyway?

12
00:02:39,574 --> 00:02:40,908
He's missing all the fun.

13
00:02:51,408 --> 00:02:52,974
Did ya miss me?

14
00:02:57,274 --> 00:02:59,141
[Goku] "Scripture Raiders."

15
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:29,841
Oh no...

16
00:03:33,274 --> 00:03:37,074
<i>[Homura] I was bound and</i>
<i>tortured for being a heretic.</i>

17
00:03:38,641 --> 00:03:42,241
<i>A little splotch in their</i>
<i>white-washed paradise.</i>

18
00:03:46,474 --> 00:03:51,241
<i>And then, the one I</i>
<i>loved was taken from me.</i>

19
00:03:51,341 --> 00:03:55,774
<i>So I rebelled against</i>
<i>the Heavens with the</i>
<i>same scorn they showed me.</i>

20
00:03:56,974 --> 00:03:58,141
<i>And what have I gained?</i>

21
00:04:00,141 --> 00:04:01,874
<i>Why do I wage this war?</i>

22
00:04:04,208 --> 00:04:06,541
<i>To create a new</i>
<i>Heaven and Earth?</i>

23
00:04:07,608 --> 00:04:08,774
<i>Or is it...</i>

24
00:04:09,574 --> 00:04:10,741
<i>something else?</i>

25
00:04:38,241 --> 00:04:39,908
[Zenon] You're finally ready,
aren't you?

26
00:04:41,441 --> 00:04:42,341
[Homura] Yeah.

27
00:04:44,041 --> 00:04:47,774
So, the time has come.

28
00:04:47,874 --> 00:04:49,241
[Zenon] No explanations.

29
00:04:49,341 --> 00:04:51,541
No motivational speeches.

30
00:04:51,641 --> 00:04:53,541
Just say the word, man.

31
00:04:53,641 --> 00:04:56,541
[Shien] If you're ready,
there's only one thing we
need to hear from you.

32
00:04:58,374 --> 00:05:00,341
[Homura] Zenon...
[Zenon] Yo.

33
00:05:00,441 --> 00:05:01,908
[Homura] Shien...
[Shien] Yes.

34
00:05:03,608 --> 00:05:05,641
[Homura] Let's go. It's time.

35
00:05:11,974 --> 00:05:13,108
[Demon yells]

36
00:05:18,408 --> 00:05:19,841
Beat that, guys!

37
00:05:21,408 --> 00:05:26,374
Did I just see that? All
those demons in five minutse?

38
00:05:26,474 --> 00:05:30,208
I don't know why we bother
fighting at all anymore.

39
00:05:30,308 --> 00:05:34,008
Pretty soon we'll just sit back
and let him do all the work.

40
00:05:34,108 --> 00:05:37,541
Soon he won't need
us at all. Freaky.

41
00:05:39,874 --> 00:05:41,841
Hey, are you alright?

42
00:05:41,941 --> 00:05:43,074
Sanzo?

43
00:05:43,874 --> 00:05:45,474
[Sanzo] Yeah. Sure.

44
00:05:46,774 --> 00:05:48,041
SO, how did I do?

45
00:05:48,141 --> 00:05:49,674
Did I win? Did I?

46
00:05:57,074 --> 00:06:00,508
What should we get? Eggrolls?
Lo Mein? Peking duck?

47
00:06:00,608 --> 00:06:03,674
Or how about I nice big Tianjin
bowl, with a side of meat buns?

48
00:06:03,774 --> 00:06:06,674
[Goku] Yeah!
[Gojyo] Everything you
listed is Chinese food.

49
00:06:06,774 --> 00:06:08,774
[Goku] Huh? You're kidding.

50
00:06:08,874 --> 00:06:10,774
[Gojyo] Good grief.

51
00:06:10,874 --> 00:06:15,274
[Hakkai] What does it matter?
At this point, I could eat just
about anything.

52
00:06:15,374 --> 00:06:16,674
[Sanzo] Moron.

53
00:06:16,774 --> 00:06:20,141
[Hakkai] What?
No paper fan today?

54
00:06:20,241 --> 00:06:23,641
[Sanzo] Hmph. I don't
have the energy.

55
00:06:23,741 --> 00:06:26,974
[Hakkai] Look, Sanzo
, you're going to totally
look like an old man

56
00:06:27,108 --> 00:06:28,974
if you're tense all the time.

57
00:06:29,074 --> 00:06:31,508
You should learn to relax a
little bit. It wouldn't kill ya.

58
00:06:34,808 --> 00:06:37,908
I could never afford to let
my guard down for a minute.

59
00:06:38,008 --> 00:06:38,574
Huh?

60
00:06:38,674 --> 00:06:39,474
[Goku] Huh?

61
00:06:46,608 --> 00:06:47,874
Not again.

62
00:06:48,641 --> 00:06:50,141
[Zenon] So how's it gonna be?

63
00:06:50,241 --> 00:06:54,841
If we throw down here, we might
destroy the entire city.

64
00:06:54,941 --> 00:06:58,708
Well, not that it matters
to us either way, right?

65
00:06:58,808 --> 00:07:02,308
[Gojyo] Hey buddy, your pick.
It doesn't matter to us either.

66
00:07:02,408 --> 00:07:03,974
[Sanzo] What is it
you want this time?

67
00:07:04,074 --> 00:07:07,908
[Hakkai] Or is it too
presumptuous to assume
that this isn't a coincidence?

68
00:07:08,008 --> 00:07:10,941
[Homura] Toying with you
guys doesn't amuse me anymore.

69
00:07:12,041 --> 00:07:14,041
So...

70
00:07:14,141 --> 00:07:18,641
this will be your last chance to
hand over the Maten Scripture...

71
00:07:18,741 --> 00:07:19,841
without incident.

72
00:07:19,941 --> 00:07:22,208
[Sanzo] Is that so?
[Homura] You should know...

73
00:07:22,308 --> 00:07:26,074
[Homura] If it comes to
a fight, there'll be no
mercy for you this time.

74
00:07:26,174 --> 00:07:28,374
[Sanzo] So, you've finally
decided to get serious?

75
00:07:28,474 --> 00:07:32,841
[Goku] Let's hop to it! I want
to get this over before the
restaurants close!

76
00:07:35,208 --> 00:07:36,708
You have until morning.

77
00:07:38,141 --> 00:07:40,674
Oh boy, here we go.

78
00:07:42,441 --> 00:07:45,708
I expect your answer
first thing tomorrow.

79
00:07:45,808 --> 00:07:49,574
Stop your stalling. You already
know our answer to that.

80
00:07:52,474 --> 00:07:55,774
Please, take your time.
Sleep on it.

81
00:07:55,874 --> 00:07:59,541
By the way, there's something
I've been meaning to tell you.

82
00:07:59,641 --> 00:08:00,941
What's that?

83
00:08:01,041 --> 00:08:05,108
This superiority act of yours...
is pissing me off.

84
00:08:06,541 --> 00:08:08,908
Has it been so long...

85
00:08:09,008 --> 00:08:10,941
that you've forgotten, Konzen?

86
00:08:11,941 --> 00:08:14,141
What do you mean?

87
00:08:14,241 --> 00:08:15,974
[Homura chuckles]

88
00:08:16,074 --> 00:08:19,508
Surely you must remember
what Heaven is like.

89
00:08:19,608 --> 00:08:23,508
When you're stuck up there,
you've got all the time
in the universe.

90
00:08:24,741 --> 00:08:28,074
You don't want the fun to
be over with too quickly.

91
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:29,441
Especially when the game
just got interesting.

92
00:08:32,041 --> 00:08:34,574
[Gojyo] Don't wait around
for us too long tomorrow.

93
00:08:34,674 --> 00:08:36,874
We re pretty bad about
keeping our appointments.

94
00:08:38,574 --> 00:08:41,108
[Shien] Are you planning to run?

95
00:08:41,208 --> 00:08:42,374
[Gojyo] Excuse me?

96
00:08:42,474 --> 00:08:44,541
[Shien] It sounded
as if you just said

97
00:08:44,641 --> 00:08:46,741
you were planning
to run from us.

98
00:08:46,841 --> 00:08:48,341
[Gojyo] The hell I am.

99
00:08:48,441 --> 00:08:51,674
[Hakkai] I, for one, am planning
to sleep in late tomorrow.

100
00:08:53,341 --> 00:08:58,341
[Homura] Don't worry, you'll
rest in peace for a long, long
time, sleepy head.

101
00:08:58,441 --> 00:09:01,308
[Gojyo] You could use a little
beauty rest yourself, cyclops.

102
00:09:01,408 --> 00:09:05,374
[Zenon] I assure you I will
have no trouble sleeping
tonight.

103
00:09:05,474 --> 00:09:08,708
Dreaming up ways to make
the moment last.

104
00:09:08,808 --> 00:09:11,908
I might just perm that
pretty mane of yours.

105
00:09:12,008 --> 00:09:16,874
Sleep tight fellas. This is
gonna be your last night
on Earth.

106
00:09:16,974 --> 00:09:18,641
[Homura] I'm looking
forward to it.

107
00:09:31,307 --> 00:09:33,247
[Gojyo] This does not
sit well with me.

108
00:09:33,247 --> 00:09:35,614
[Goku] What do you mean?
It's delicious!

109
00:09:35,714 --> 00:09:39,080
[Gojyo] Will you just shut
up and eat! I'm talking
about Hamura!

110
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:42,147
[Goku] Hey! You don't
have to ask me twice.

111
00:09:42,247 --> 00:09:46,147
[Hakkai] I feel like the mouse
the cat plays with before
it's going to kill it.

112
00:09:46,247 --> 00:09:48,180
Why don't they just
take what they want?

113
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:51,514
It should be easy enough for
someone with their powers.

114
00:09:51,614 --> 00:09:56,780
[Gojyo] Either they're really
confident, really polite,

115
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,914
or really bored...

116
00:09:59,014 --> 00:10:02,247
[Hakkai] I'm gonna go out
on a limb here and say
all of the above.

117
00:10:02,347 --> 00:10:05,814
[Gojyo] Or this could be their
way of flirting with one of us.

118
00:10:05,914 --> 00:10:09,147
[Hakkai] We know they're after
the Maten Scripture.

119
00:10:09,247 --> 00:10:12,780
That gives us a foundation from
which to build our defenses.

120
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:16,480
[Gojyo] Defenses? More like
defenseless, if you ask me.

121
00:10:19,047 --> 00:10:21,414
I don't care if they are gods.

122
00:10:21,514 --> 00:10:25,847
We eliminate anyone who's stupid
enough to stand in our way.

123
00:10:25,947 --> 00:10:27,980
That's all there is to it!

124
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:30,080
[Goku] Hey, where
you going, Sanzo?

125
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,214
Sanzo!

126
00:10:35,614 --> 00:10:38,480
[Goku] Come on! Why won't you
tell me what's bothering you?

127
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:40,580
[Sanzo] Do you have
to be such a pest?

128
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:44,980
[Goku] See? This is the way you
always act when something's
wrong. I can tell.

129
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,380
[Sanzo] Oh? Is that right?

130
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,614
[Goku] Look, I'll stop pestering
you if you buy me a meat bun!

131
00:10:49,714 --> 00:10:52,480
[Sanzo] We just ate,
for crying out loud!

132
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:55,347
[Goku] I can't help it,
walking give me an appetite.

133
00:10:55,447 --> 00:10:58,114
Please! Just a little one?

134
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:05,380
[Sazno] [irritated sigh] But I
just gave you... Damn.

135
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:08,647
[Goku] Yay! Meat bun! Meat bun!

136
00:11:12,247 --> 00:11:13,314
[Gojyo] Hey, Hakkai.

137
00:11:13,414 --> 00:11:15,647
[Hakkai] Yeah?

138
00:11:15,747 --> 00:11:18,547
[Gojyo] Ah, it's nothing.

139
00:11:18,647 --> 00:11:22,314
[Hakkai] Please just say it.
Otherwise I'll be wondering
about it all night.

140
00:11:23,914 --> 00:11:26,914
[Gojyo] It's just... Do you
think we can take these guys?

141
00:11:28,647 --> 00:11:33,780
Who knows? It sure felt like we
were outmatched in our last
encounter, if you ask me.

142
00:11:38,447 --> 00:11:40,347
We'll find out, won't we?

143
00:11:42,947 --> 00:11:43,847
Huh?

144
00:11:43,947 --> 00:11:45,080
[gasps]

145
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:02,714
Damn you!

146
00:12:02,814 --> 00:12:04,980
Not so fast, Gojyo.

147
00:12:05,114 --> 00:12:09,347
It appears as if they're just
here for a drink like we are.

148
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:12,447
[Zenon] A shot of
your strongest.

149
00:12:12,547 --> 00:12:14,780
[Shein] Oolong tea please.

150
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,580
[Zenon] And a round for our
friends over there.

151
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:19,447
[Gojyo] I don't like the crowd
here, Hakkai!

152
00:12:19,547 --> 00:12:22,747
Let's find some place that
doesn't leave a bad taste
in my mouth.

153
00:12:22,847 --> 00:12:27,280
[Zenon] Ease back on the
testosterone. The fight's
tomorrow remember?

154
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:29,847
[Gojyo] I've never
been very patient.

155
00:12:29,947 --> 00:12:31,614
[Shein] What an oaf.

156
00:12:31,714 --> 00:12:32,747
[Gojyo] Say what?

157
00:12:32,847 --> 00:12:36,447
I knew someone who often
spoke like that.

158
00:12:42,214 --> 00:12:46,147
[Kenren] Flowers are great.
Women are better.

159
00:12:50,447 --> 00:12:52,947
But a glass of good
rice win is heaven.

160
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:08,047
[Shein] I can never know the
pleasures of a good wine,

161
00:13:08,147 --> 00:13:11,080
but I do think I know what that
man was trying to say.

162
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:14,614
[Gojyo] Hmph. I'd like to meet
this guy sometime.

163
00:13:14,714 --> 00:13:19,880
So, any chance of introducing
an oaf like me to some of these
women you've been talking about,

164
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:22,114
oh illustrious one?

165
00:13:22,214 --> 00:13:27,614
[Shein] I'm afraid I don't know
any women, but there are some
flowers right there.

166
00:13:27,714 --> 00:13:30,147
[Gojyo] Pretty neat trick.
What is this?

167
00:13:30,247 --> 00:13:33,014
Fattening the bird before
sending him to the slaughter?

168
00:13:33,114 --> 00:13:34,914
[Hakkai] It doesn't matter.

169
00:13:35,014 --> 00:13:38,747
This little situation will all
be settled in the morning.

170
00:13:38,847 --> 00:13:40,614
Isn't that right?

171
00:13:40,714 --> 00:13:44,147
[Zenon] Well put, my friend.
Well put indeed.

172
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,747
[Goyjo] That about sums it.

173
00:13:45,847 --> 00:13:48,014
[Zenon] Who know what the new
day brings.

174
00:13:48,114 --> 00:13:49,280
[Gojyo] I'll drink to that.

175
00:14:10,614 --> 00:14:13,480
Damnit. It's no use.
I can't sleep.

176
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:27,014
Tomorrow.

177
00:14:27,114 --> 00:14:30,080
Tomorrow's the big day.

178
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:31,314
[Sanzo] Can't sleep?

179
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:37,580
[Goku] No.

180
00:14:38,547 --> 00:14:40,947
[Goku] Say, Sanzo.

181
00:14:41,047 --> 00:14:43,647
You think the weather will
be good tomorrow?

182
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:47,014
[Sanzo] That settles it.
You are an idiot.

183
00:14:47,114 --> 00:14:49,380
[Goku] Why am I an idiot?
I was just...

184
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:51,614
[Sanzo] Just what?

185
00:14:51,747 --> 00:14:53,614
[Goku] I just can't wait.

186
00:14:53,714 --> 00:14:57,614
All I can think about is bashing
Homura's face in tomorrow.

187
00:14:57,714 --> 00:14:59,347
[Goku] I'm going crazy.

188
00:14:59,447 --> 00:15:01,714
[Sanzo] It's not like it's your
birthday, you know.

189
00:15:05,914 --> 00:15:10,014
I know that. It's just, I
think I can really beat him.

190
00:15:11,514 --> 00:15:13,114
Just go to sleep, will ya?

191
00:15:19,947 --> 00:15:24,514
Judging by the evening sky,
it looks like it should be
a nice day tomorrow.

192
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:31,747
Homura, the day is mine.

193
00:15:59,596 --> 00:16:00,729
[Homura] I'm waiting.

194
00:16:02,877 --> 00:16:04,077
What is you reply?

195
00:16:05,645 --> 00:16:08,545
[Sanzo] Go shopping for
scriptures elsewhere, scum.

196
00:16:10,814 --> 00:16:13,247
[Homura] Are you sure this
is how you want it?

197
00:16:13,347 --> 00:16:15,314
Well it's your show, Goku.

198
00:16:15,414 --> 00:16:18,581
Remember that it's the Maten
Scripture they're after.

199
00:16:18,681 --> 00:16:23,014
So what that means is, I have
to get them before they get
us. Right?

200
00:16:23,114 --> 00:16:26,014
That's about what it comes
down to, yes.

201
00:16:26,114 --> 00:16:29,381
That's what it always comes
down to, isn't it?

202
00:16:29,481 --> 00:16:32,247
What ever happens,
happens. Fine.

203
00:16:32,347 --> 00:16:35,747
[Zenon] So, can we get this
little party started now?

204
00:16:35,881 --> 00:16:38,514
[Shein] I think we have delayed
for long enough.

205
00:16:41,881 --> 00:16:43,347
Let the battle begin.

206
00:16:56,114 --> 00:16:58,747
<i>I haven't forgotten our</i>
<i>last meeting, Homura.</i>

207
00:16:59,414 --> 00:17:00,714
Grow stronger...

208
00:17:02,181 --> 00:17:05,114
You must grow stronger,
Son Goku.

209
00:17:06,847 --> 00:17:08,781
<i>Well, Homura, today you get</i>
<i>your wish.</i>

210
00:17:11,247 --> 00:17:14,014
<i>Let's see how strong</i>
<i>I really am!</i>

211
00:17:15,614 --> 00:17:17,047
Come and get me!

212
00:17:17,414 --> 00:17:18,981
Homura!

213
00:17:22,381 --> 00:17:23,681
Ready to rumble?

214
00:17:23,781 --> 00:17:25,347
We're coming for you now.

215
00:17:26,014 --> 00:17:27,214
Eat lead!

216
00:17:29,647 --> 00:17:32,647
[Hakkai] Aw come on. You're
gonna have to do better
than that.

217
00:17:33,381 --> 00:17:35,181
I will.

218
00:17:36,847 --> 00:17:41,347
Don't forget about the rest
of us standing over here,
you morons.

219
00:17:41,447 --> 00:17:45,847
<i>[Homura] Such speed and</i>
<i>power, his skills have</i>
<i>certainly improved.</i>

220
00:17:45,947 --> 00:17:47,947
<i>It's as if he's a completely</i>
<i>different person.</i>

221
00:17:49,081 --> 00:17:51,381
<i>Son Goku, with this...</i>

222
00:17:52,314 --> 00:17:54,914
[Goku] Homura, what are
you looking at?!

223
00:17:58,714 --> 00:17:59,847
What?!

224
00:18:00,481 --> 00:18:01,747
It's over!

225
00:18:05,947 --> 00:18:11,714
Now now. What kind of loyal,
trusted henchman would I be if I
let you touch him that easily?

226
00:18:19,214 --> 00:18:20,714
Homura!

227
00:18:24,247 --> 00:18:24,814
Goku!

228
00:18:24,914 --> 00:18:25,814
[Both] Homura!

229
00:18:25,914 --> 00:18:27,347
I- I hit him.

230
00:18:34,814 --> 00:18:37,747
Looks like you pass the test.

231
00:18:50,847 --> 00:18:52,381
Not so fast!

232
00:18:52,481 --> 00:18:54,614
[Zenon] That's my line.

233
00:18:54,714 --> 00:18:56,581
This'll slow him down!

234
00:18:56,681 --> 00:18:57,814
That won't do.

235
00:19:00,214 --> 00:19:01,381
<i>Konzen!</i>

236
00:19:03,447 --> 00:19:04,914
[Sanzo] I've had enough of this!

237
00:19:13,214 --> 00:19:14,581
<i>Damn!</i>

238
00:19:17,381 --> 00:19:18,514
Sanzo!

239
00:19:22,314 --> 00:19:23,847
You're still resisting?

240
00:19:24,714 --> 00:19:26,347
That I am.

241
00:19:26,447 --> 00:19:27,581
In that case...

242
00:19:39,314 --> 00:19:41,114
So it comes to an end.

243
00:19:52,181 --> 00:19:55,347
I'll take this if you
don't mind, Konzen.

244
00:19:55,481 --> 00:19:59,514
And, General Kenren,
be sure to let Goku know,

245
00:19:59,614 --> 00:20:05,014
if he wants the Maten Scripture
it will be waiting for him in
the Tower of Konran.

246
00:20:05,114 --> 00:20:06,247
That so?!

247
00:20:08,047 --> 00:20:09,181
I'll be waiting.

248
00:20:11,214 --> 00:20:12,347
[Sanzo] Homura!

249
00:20:13,047 --> 00:20:15,347
You... bastard...

250
00:20:15,447 --> 00:20:16,581
You!

251
00:20:26,914 --> 00:20:28,047
Son of a...

252
00:20:28,514 --> 00:20:29,314
...bitch.

253
00:20:29,914 --> 00:20:31,047
Sanzo!

254
00:20:34,614 --> 00:20:37,081
That's what I like about
you, Konzen.

255
00:20:38,247 --> 00:20:40,581
Zenon, Shien, let's go.

256
00:20:43,114 --> 00:20:44,514
Sanzo!

257
00:20:44,614 --> 00:20:45,747
[Gojyo] Sanzo!

258
00:20:46,614 --> 00:20:47,881
Sanzo!
