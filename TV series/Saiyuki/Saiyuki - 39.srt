1
00:01:38,868 --> 00:01:40,808
[Hakkai] Goku,
please be careful.

2
00:01:40,808 --> 00:01:42,441
I don't want you
dropping our food.

3
00:01:42,541 --> 00:01:44,908
[Goku] Stop worrying, Hakkai.

4
00:01:45,008 --> 00:01:46,141
Gyah!

5
00:01:48,408 --> 00:01:50,075
[Gojyo] Dumbass.

6
00:01:50,175 --> 00:01:51,508
[Hakkai] Don't be
too hard on him.

7
00:01:51,608 --> 00:01:53,475
He's probably just
worried about Sanzo.

8
00:01:55,375 --> 00:01:57,541
Devil meets his match, eh?

9
00:02:00,008 --> 00:02:02,008
[Hakkai] This is a long rain...

10
00:02:09,008 --> 00:02:10,908
[Goku] "Waiting out the storm."

11
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:23,275
[Door opens]

12
00:02:23,375 --> 00:02:24,575
[Goku] You still awake?

13
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:27,775
Why don't you lie down, Sanzo?

14
00:02:27,875 --> 00:02:30,675
It might help if you laid off
the cigarettes for a while.

15
00:02:32,341 --> 00:02:34,108
I bought you some cough drops.

16
00:02:34,241 --> 00:02:35,341
And a mask!

17
00:02:36,375 --> 00:02:38,108
And a can of peaches.

18
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:40,375
If you want, I'll
open it for ya.

19
00:02:42,708 --> 00:02:43,808
[Sanzo] I'm not sick.

20
00:02:43,908 --> 00:02:45,475
What?

21
00:02:46,408 --> 00:02:49,875
But... I can tell
something's not right.

22
00:02:57,175 --> 00:03:00,141
I told you! You shouldn't smoke.

23
00:03:00,241 --> 00:03:01,775
C'mere.

24
00:03:01,875 --> 00:03:03,008
No fever.

25
00:03:12,908 --> 00:03:15,275
I told you, I'm not sick.

26
00:03:16,675 --> 00:03:18,841
[Goku] Then what is it? Tell me!

27
00:03:18,941 --> 00:03:22,508
You don't eat, you don't talk,
you've been acting all weird.

28
00:03:22,608 --> 00:03:25,508
There must be some reason
you're acting this way.

29
00:03:25,608 --> 00:03:27,375
[Goku] It's got nothing
to do with you.

30
00:03:29,041 --> 00:03:30,141
[Goku] Yes, it does!

31
00:03:33,941 --> 00:03:35,208
Come on. Sanzo, tell me.

32
00:03:36,775 --> 00:03:38,108
What's wrong with you?

33
00:03:39,541 --> 00:03:40,741
Shut up.

34
00:03:40,841 --> 00:03:42,975
What? What did-

35
00:03:48,375 --> 00:03:49,508
[Sanzo] Get out.

36
00:03:50,608 --> 00:03:54,108
Sanzo... you really got
me worried about you.

37
00:03:55,641 --> 00:03:57,408
Why are you here?

38
00:03:58,541 --> 00:03:59,975
I told you to get out!

39
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:11,675
Goku?

40
00:04:19,275 --> 00:04:21,041
[Gojyo] Hey! Where
ya goin' monkey?

41
00:04:21,141 --> 00:04:22,275
[Hakkai] Goku!

42
00:04:37,975 --> 00:04:41,608
[Gojyo] Don't get so worked up.
He always gets like this.

43
00:04:43,741 --> 00:04:45,875
I had thought of that as well.

44
00:04:45,975 --> 00:04:47,108
Damn...

45
00:04:48,841 --> 00:04:51,608
[Hakkai] We can't leave him
alone like this either.

46
00:05:00,108 --> 00:05:01,408
[Knocking at the door]

47
00:05:01,508 --> 00:05:02,641
[Door opens]

48
00:05:04,575 --> 00:05:08,375
If only... the rain
would let up soon.

49
00:05:08,475 --> 00:05:11,308
Then you would
feel better... right?

50
00:05:11,408 --> 00:05:13,675
Don't treat me like I'm sick.

51
00:05:14,875 --> 00:05:16,241
[Hakkai] I know this because...

52
00:05:16,341 --> 00:05:17,975
rain does this to me too.

53
00:05:27,841 --> 00:05:29,675
<i>[Goku] What's with</i>
<i>the attitude?</i>

54
00:05:29,775 --> 00:05:31,541
<i>What am I? Just a-</i>

55
00:05:33,008 --> 00:05:35,308
All alone, Son Goku?

56
00:05:35,941 --> 00:05:36,975
Go away.

57
00:05:37,075 --> 00:05:38,541
I'm in a really bad mood, okay?

58
00:05:38,641 --> 00:05:40,208
So leave me alone.

59
00:05:40,308 --> 00:05:41,608
That so?

60
00:05:44,841 --> 00:05:48,175
I swear I'll kill you.
I'm warning you!

61
00:05:48,275 --> 00:05:51,641
What's the matter, Goku?
Someone picking on you?

62
00:05:52,875 --> 00:05:54,008
Damn you!

63
00:06:11,175 --> 00:06:13,441
[Hakkai] If you feel you can
eat something, please do so.

64
00:06:14,941 --> 00:06:16,275
I'll be by later to
pick up the dishes.

65
00:06:49,141 --> 00:06:50,508
[Homura] You're still weak.

66
00:06:50,608 --> 00:06:52,141
Far too weak.

67
00:06:52,241 --> 00:06:54,075
I'll kill YOU!

68
00:06:59,875 --> 00:07:02,108
[Homura] What's the
matter, Son Goku?

69
00:07:02,208 --> 00:07:04,808
You use to be so much
stronger than this.

70
00:07:10,075 --> 00:07:13,841
You want me?
Recall your true form.

71
00:07:13,941 --> 00:07:16,408
Seiten Taisei Son Goku.

72
00:07:17,441 --> 00:07:19,175
[Bones popping,
Goku yells in pain]

73
00:07:33,708 --> 00:07:36,375
[Gojyo] So the monkey
never came back?

74
00:07:37,608 --> 00:07:39,375
It looks that way.

75
00:07:41,641 --> 00:07:43,241
[Gojyo] It's not letting up.

76
00:07:46,408 --> 00:07:47,341
[Hakkai] Where you going?

77
00:07:47,441 --> 00:07:48,541
[Gojyo] Cigarettes.

78
00:07:48,641 --> 00:07:50,308
[Hakkai] But we
still have plenty.

79
00:07:50,408 --> 00:07:52,708
[Gojyo] I'm particular
about my brands.

80
00:08:44,441 --> 00:08:46,975
<i>[Goku] If this place were</i>
<i>deep within the earth...</i>

81
00:08:51,775 --> 00:08:54,875
<i>I would not yearn for</i>
<i>a sun I never knew.</i>

82
00:09:03,475 --> 00:09:05,108
[Homura] Are you awake?

83
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:12,575
You bastard!

84
00:09:24,375 --> 00:09:26,275
[Homura] Be sure to
grit your teeth now.

85
00:09:27,441 --> 00:09:29,608
[Bone popping]
[Goku] Oooow!

86
00:09:31,775 --> 00:09:34,708
Damn... you!

87
00:09:34,808 --> 00:09:36,241
What do you want?

88
00:09:37,608 --> 00:09:38,775
Nothing.

89
00:09:38,875 --> 00:09:41,775
Why don't you just
kill me? Why the-

90
00:09:42,608 --> 00:09:44,441
Hey, Homura!

91
00:09:49,175 --> 00:09:52,375
Damn it! Let me go, you bastard!

92
00:10:07,317 --> 00:10:08,997
[Gojyo] Looks like
he got in a scuffle.

93
00:10:08,997 --> 00:10:10,864
[Zenon] You lookin'
for that pipsqueak?

94
00:10:14,197 --> 00:10:15,730
Give it up.

95
00:10:15,830 --> 00:10:16,997
[Gojyo] What'd you say?

96
00:10:17,097 --> 00:10:21,397
You're not gonna get him back.
Homura's got him now.

97
00:10:21,497 --> 00:10:24,397
[Gojyo] But his highness
already has you blokes.

98
00:10:24,530 --> 00:10:26,097
What's he need another pet for?

99
00:10:26,197 --> 00:10:28,097
[Zenon] You're a funny guy.

100
00:10:28,197 --> 00:10:29,464
[Gojyo] Tell me what
you did with him!

101
00:10:29,564 --> 00:10:30,697
[Zenon chuckles]

102
00:10:31,397 --> 00:10:32,530
Tell me!

103
00:10:43,697 --> 00:10:45,730
[Hakkai] Did he say
Homura has him?

104
00:10:45,830 --> 00:10:48,497
[Gojyo] Huh? Yeah. Why?

105
00:10:48,597 --> 00:10:50,697
[Hakkai] Sounds like he's
still alive at least.

106
00:10:52,197 --> 00:10:54,430
Probably, but...

107
00:10:54,530 --> 00:10:56,664
What are we going to
do about it, Sanzo?

108
00:10:56,764 --> 00:11:00,597
We can't just let people
come and take our monkey
whenever they feel like it.

109
00:11:00,697 --> 00:11:02,697
Not without paying
for it, anyway.

110
00:11:06,397 --> 00:11:07,530
[Hakkai] Sanzo.

111
00:11:09,564 --> 00:11:10,564
[Sanzo] Leave it be.

112
00:11:10,664 --> 00:11:12,097
[Hakkai] What?

113
00:11:12,197 --> 00:11:14,997
I see no reason to get him back.

114
00:11:15,097 --> 00:11:16,197
[Gojyo] What's up with that?

115
00:11:16,297 --> 00:11:19,697
You don't actually think
Goku betrayed us, do you?

116
00:11:20,564 --> 00:11:21,597
[Sanzo] Betrayed?

117
00:11:21,697 --> 00:11:25,164
It's not like Goku actually
owes us anything.

118
00:11:25,264 --> 00:11:26,597
[Gojyo] Hey, now...

119
00:11:26,697 --> 00:11:29,564
[Hakkai] Do what you want.
We're going to look for Goku.

120
00:11:29,664 --> 00:11:30,997
[Gojyo] We are? Hey!

121
00:11:31,130 --> 00:11:33,897
[Hakkai] Sanzo, please wait
here in case Goku returns.

122
00:11:33,997 --> 00:11:36,730
And I do understand why
you're acting this way.

123
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:39,264
You may not admit
it to yourself now,

124
00:11:39,364 --> 00:11:44,697
but you probably feel pretty
bad for how you lashed out
at poor Goku earlier.

125
00:11:44,797 --> 00:11:48,197
But this isn't going to solve
anything either, you know that.

126
00:12:00,197 --> 00:12:01,497
How's the shoulder?

127
00:12:04,864 --> 00:12:06,630
You look a little hungry.

128
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:10,864
Look here.

129
00:12:12,197 --> 00:12:14,297
This is for you.

130
00:12:15,830 --> 00:12:19,597
Don't be stubborn.
Why are you so afraid?

131
00:12:19,697 --> 00:12:21,064
[Goku] I'm not afraid!

132
00:12:21,164 --> 00:12:24,064
It isn't Sanzo that
you fear, is it?

133
00:12:24,164 --> 00:12:27,864
[Goku] I'm no one's slave!
I'm not afraid of anything!

134
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:30,164
[Homura chuckles]

135
00:12:30,597 --> 00:12:31,897
Is that so?

136
00:12:36,264 --> 00:12:38,864
What about on that
mountain, Goku?

137
00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:42,197
Did you laugh at your prison?

138
00:12:42,297 --> 00:12:45,930
Did you curse the petty
gods who put you there?

139
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:49,664
Are you pleased to have
your memories locked away?

140
00:13:07,097 --> 00:13:08,930
[Goku] Bastard...

141
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:11,664
[Homura] Don't you wanna
have your powers back?

142
00:13:11,797 --> 00:13:14,930
[Goku] I can do it myself.
I don't need you for that!

143
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:17,797
[Homura] What if you can't?
Remember...

144
00:13:17,897 --> 00:13:21,330
You are a heresy, just as I am.

145
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:24,930
A solitary, abominable
existence.

146
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:26,730
[Goku] No, I'm...

147
00:13:26,830 --> 00:13:29,597
[Homura] That's why
you cling to Sanzo.

148
00:13:29,697 --> 00:13:32,264
Because he validates
your existence.

149
00:13:32,364 --> 00:13:34,030
[Goku] No!

150
00:13:34,797 --> 00:13:36,830
What about Sanzo?

151
00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:41,030
Does he... need you?

152
00:13:41,130 --> 00:13:44,897
Have you ever been anything
other than his... servant?

153
00:13:45,930 --> 00:13:47,730
Just shut up.

154
00:13:48,797 --> 00:13:51,964
[Homura] You're far more
important than that.

155
00:13:52,064 --> 00:13:54,797
I can see that you sense it too.

156
00:13:54,897 --> 00:13:58,430
How lonely you must feel.

157
00:13:58,530 --> 00:14:00,197
[Goku] I don't understand...

158
00:14:00,297 --> 00:14:01,897
What do you want me to do?!

159
00:14:03,330 --> 00:14:06,297
[Homura] You don't
have to do anything.
[Goku] But!

160
00:14:06,397 --> 00:14:08,430
Let me protect you.

161
00:14:08,530 --> 00:14:09,397
Protect me?!

162
00:14:09,497 --> 00:14:12,397
I'll give you everything
you desire.

163
00:14:12,497 --> 00:14:15,464
All you have to do
is come with me.

164
00:14:15,564 --> 00:14:17,764
You're crazy! Like hell!

165
00:14:17,864 --> 00:14:19,330
Like hell I will!

166
00:14:26,597 --> 00:14:27,930
But... why?

167
00:14:28,764 --> 00:14:32,364
You are coming... Son Goku?

168
00:14:39,897 --> 00:14:43,097
[Gojyo] Damn that monkey
for making us hunt for
him in the rain.

169
00:14:44,797 --> 00:14:46,097
What is it?

170
00:14:46,197 --> 00:14:48,730
So I guess you don't
have any doubts.

171
00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:49,830
What?

172
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:52,930
About why Goku hasn't come back.

173
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:56,464
You don't think Goku's in
cahoots with Homura, do you?

174
00:14:56,564 --> 00:14:59,164
No. Then again...

175
00:14:59,264 --> 00:15:01,330
[Gojyo] What's there
to think about?

176
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:05,664
The one thing that primate
doesn't have the stomach
for is betrayal.

177
00:15:05,764 --> 00:15:07,930
Not to mention the brains.

178
00:15:08,964 --> 00:15:10,530
[Zenon laughing]

179
00:15:10,630 --> 00:15:11,630
Up there!

180
00:15:11,730 --> 00:15:14,530
[Zenon] Their playful
banter is so adorable.

181
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:17,130
[Shien] You shouldn't mock
the poor things, Zenon.

182
00:15:17,230 --> 00:15:20,430
[Gojyo] Stop screwing around!
What'd you do with Goku?!

183
00:15:20,530 --> 00:15:22,430
Nothin'.

184
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:26,697
I thought I told you guys...

185
00:15:26,797 --> 00:15:30,564
Homura's got 'im. Get over it.

186
00:15:30,664 --> 00:15:33,830
We'll just keep looking
for him, if you don't mind.

187
00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:36,130
How very laudable of you.

188
00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:51,264
Shit.

189
00:16:07,930 --> 00:16:10,397
[Shien] So they are
persistent, aren't they?

190
00:16:10,497 --> 00:16:13,897
[Hakkai] I've been told it's
one of my finer virtues.

191
00:16:13,997 --> 00:16:17,830
[Zenon] There's not much virture
in being dead now, is there?

192
00:16:17,930 --> 00:16:22,997
[Gojyo] I'm afraid dying
has never been one of
my strong suits.

193
00:16:23,097 --> 00:16:28,197
[Homura] You'll only fight this
valiantly so you can keep Goku's
power all to yourselves.

194
00:16:34,164 --> 00:16:35,530
Power?

195
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:38,930
Come on, don't be silly.
He's just a stupid monkey.

196
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:41,930
Besides, if you guys
take him away from us...

197
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:45,030
then we can't play mah-jongg.

198
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:47,730
Tell me what you did with Goku!

199
00:16:47,830 --> 00:16:50,430
[Homura] That is none
of your business!

200
00:16:51,530 --> 00:16:52,797
[Hakkai] What did you say?!

201
00:16:56,564 --> 00:16:57,997
Gojyo!

202
00:16:58,097 --> 00:16:59,397
AAAH!

203
00:16:59,497 --> 00:17:00,630
Hakkai!

204
00:17:18,864 --> 00:17:20,464
[Hakkai] Sanzo!

205
00:17:23,597 --> 00:17:25,597
I couldn't sleep.

206
00:17:27,030 --> 00:17:29,597
Lonely without your Goku, eh?

207
00:17:33,697 --> 00:17:35,330
[Sanzo] An idle spectator?

208
00:17:36,297 --> 00:17:37,764
What a nuisance.

209
00:17:47,364 --> 00:17:50,297
<i>[Goku] If this place had been</i>
<i>deep within the earth...</i>

210
00:17:50,397 --> 00:17:54,197
<i>I never would have had to know</i>
<i>freedom... and loneliness.</i>

211
00:17:57,030 --> 00:17:58,430
Come back here!

212
00:17:59,564 --> 00:18:01,630
Sanzo, you're the mean one!

213
00:18:01,730 --> 00:18:03,797
You don't care about me at all!

214
00:18:03,897 --> 00:18:06,864
What's wrong if I worry about
you every once in a while?!

215
00:18:06,964 --> 00:18:09,697
If I knew it was going to be
like this when I got out,

216
00:18:09,797 --> 00:18:11,764
I would have asked you
to leave me there!

217
00:18:22,197 --> 00:18:26,930
I'm always causing you nothing
but trouble. I hate that...

218
00:18:27,564 --> 00:18:30,330
What am I to you?

219
00:18:30,430 --> 00:18:33,297
I really wanna know...
Just tell me.

220
00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:38,464
Hey, what the hell did
you say to him, anyway?

221
00:18:39,097 --> 00:18:41,664
Nothing.

222
00:18:41,764 --> 00:18:46,630
<i>[Homura] Sanzo, Son Goku needs</i>
<i>the light of your wisdom.</i>

223
00:18:46,730 --> 00:18:50,797
<i>'Cause it appears that</i>
<i>I cannot be his sun.</i>

224
00:18:52,197 --> 00:18:56,064
When I come again,
I will take him by force.

225
00:18:56,164 --> 00:18:57,364
Farewell.

226
00:19:00,397 --> 00:19:01,597
Later.

227
00:19:05,897 --> 00:19:08,864
[Sanzo] I'm in a bad mood
because of the rain.

228
00:19:08,964 --> 00:19:11,097
The rest you'll have to
figure out for yourself.

229
00:19:13,164 --> 00:19:14,297
Sanz...

230
00:19:18,197 --> 00:19:20,897
<i>[Goku] He led me out</i>
<i>of the darkness...</i>

231
00:19:20,997 --> 00:19:24,997
<i>He showed me a world... much...</i>

232
00:19:25,097 --> 00:19:27,230
<i>much brighter than the sun.</i>

233
00:19:42,064 --> 00:19:44,297
[Sanzo] I never wanted
you to be a servant.

234
00:20:01,986 --> 00:20:03,752
[Hakkai] Shall we get going?

235
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:15,540
[Gojyo] How far
are we going today?

236
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:19,373
[Hakkai] I could use something
to snack on if we're gonna
be on the road for a while.

237
00:20:19,473 --> 00:20:23,673
[Sanzo] Hey. Go buy some
pickled kelp and frozen
mandarin oranges.

238
00:20:23,773 --> 00:20:25,640
[Goku] Why do I have
to go get 'em?

239
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:27,807
[Sanzo] Because I'll kill
you if you don't do it.

240
00:20:27,907 --> 00:20:30,140
[Goku] I thought you said
I wasn't your servant?

241
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:32,973
[Goku yells] I'm going,
I'm going!

242
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,207
[Gojyo] Man, you
are so twisted.

243
00:20:39,307 --> 00:20:40,507
[Sanzo] Who you calling twisted?

244
00:20:40,607 --> 00:20:42,373
[Gojyo] No one! Watch it!

245
00:20:42,473 --> 00:20:46,973
[Hakkai laughs] Glad to see
everyone's in a good mood
now that the sun's out.
