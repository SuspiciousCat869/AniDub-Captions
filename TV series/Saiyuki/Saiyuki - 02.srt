1
00:01:35,155 --> 00:01:38,536
[Narrator] And so, to prevent
the resurrection of the grand
demon Gyumaoh,

2
00:01:38,536 --> 00:01:45,936
the most high Merciful Goddess
sent Sanzo, Goku, Hakkai, and
Gojyo to India, far to the west.

3
00:01:58,903 --> 00:02:00,903
Goddamnit, this one's hot.

4
00:02:01,003 --> 00:02:02,370
Goku, get me another beer.

5
00:02:03,236 --> 00:02:05,203
Get your own beer, jerkoff!

6
00:02:06,203 --> 00:02:07,970
Okay. You're going to get me
another beer

7
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:10,836
or I'm going to take this can
and shove it up your whiny
little ass! You got that?

8
00:02:10,936 --> 00:02:13,436
You just try and see what
happens you shit head!

9
00:02:13,536 --> 00:02:14,836
Oh yeah?!

10
00:02:14,936 --> 00:02:17,570
You're just looking for an
excuse to touch my ass,
aren't ya?

11
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:19,103
[Sanzo] [exsaperated] Please.
[Gojyo] You little fag!

12
00:02:19,203 --> 00:02:20,403
Don't project your fantasies
on me!

13
00:02:20,503 --> 00:02:23,303
Alright, that's it! Pull over,
I'm taking him out!

14
00:02:23,403 --> 00:02:26,303
Your little unrequited love
affair is starting to get on
my nerves!

15
00:02:26,403 --> 00:02:28,270
Get a room!

16
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:31,070
[Hakkai] Good move there,
uh Sanzo.

17
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:32,370
I thought so, thanks.

18
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:36,303
Oh my, awful quiet back there
guys. Are you making out?

19
00:02:36,403 --> 00:02:37,803
[Gojyo] Shut up, Hakkai.

20
00:02:37,903 --> 00:02:39,303
[Goku] Yeah, shut up.

21
00:02:42,636 --> 00:02:45,303
<i>[Merciful Goddess] West</i>
<i>and East.</i>

22
00:02:45,403 --> 00:02:48,003
<i>Each has begun to stir.</i>

23
00:02:48,103 --> 00:02:50,936
<i>To where the sun rises.</i>

24
00:02:51,036 --> 00:02:53,270
<i>And beyond where it sun sets.</i>

25
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:55,270
[Door opens]

26
00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:57,670
[Jiroushin] I have a report from
the Sanbutsushin.

27
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:02,903
It has finally happened.

28
00:03:03,003 --> 00:03:05,303
The motions for which began
long ago.

29
00:03:05,403 --> 00:03:06,536
[Jiroushin] Pardon?

30
00:03:10,403 --> 00:03:12,803
<i>Five hundred years ago...</i>

31
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:15,103
Since that moment!

32
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:32,203
[Goku] God! This food
is awesome!

33
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:38,036
[Goku] Hey, you H2O asshole, get
your hands off! That's mine!

34
00:03:38,136 --> 00:03:39,403
[Goku] Give it back!
[Gojyo] Come on...

35
00:03:39,503 --> 00:03:40,536
[Goku] Come on, jerkoff!
Give it!
[Gojyo] Yep, that's it.

36
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:45,603
[The two continue fighting over
the food.]

37
00:03:45,703 --> 00:03:48,303
God! Give him his damn chicken
and order your own!

38
00:03:48,403 --> 00:03:49,870
That poor little guy.

39
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:52,203
[Hakkai] Ah don't feel sorry
for him.

40
00:03:52,303 --> 00:03:55,136
By the way, are you the magician
in the kitchen?

41
00:03:55,236 --> 00:03:57,103
Yes. Do you like it?

42
00:03:57,203 --> 00:03:58,203
[Goku] Wow, you're amazing!

43
00:03:58,303 --> 00:04:00,703
I've never eaten this good in my
life, ever!

44
00:04:00,803 --> 00:04:02,503
I'm mean it, thanks!

45
00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:08,436
You're welcome. I'm glad you
like it.

46
00:04:08,536 --> 00:04:10,203
Yeah, yeah right the food's
4 stars.

47
00:04:10,303 --> 00:04:12,703
How's the demonic clientel
acting lately?

48
00:04:12,803 --> 00:04:15,303
What's to say? They're scum.

49
00:04:15,403 --> 00:04:20,670
Always were. One day they
started acting like their
true nature.

50
00:04:20,770 --> 00:04:26,870
Ugly. Killed ten people in our
town then they just dissapeared.

51
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:31,136
<i>So they congregate, attack,</i>
<i>then the group leaves.</i>

52
00:04:31,236 --> 00:04:34,403
<i>Someone calls them, but to what</i>
<i>gathering place?</i>

53
00:04:34,503 --> 00:04:38,603
<i>It's like a summoning that</i>
<i>grows louder. And they</i>
<i>follow it.</i>

54
00:04:38,703 --> 00:04:41,403
[Houmei] I wish every demons
would just disappear!

55
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:44,270
What they've done...

56
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:46,603
The things they've done!

57
00:04:46,703 --> 00:04:49,570
They're monsters, all of
them monsters!

58
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:50,803
[Man] Houmei!

59
00:04:58,236 --> 00:05:02,670
I'm sorry, one of those killed
was a dear friend of hers.

60
00:05:03,536 --> 00:05:04,703
Will that be all?

61
00:05:06,636 --> 00:05:12,470
[Hakkai] Too many crimes. The
humans die the survivors grieve.

62
00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:14,036
They grow angry. Who could
blame them?

63
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:17,636
[Sanzo] They don't know the real
reason for what's happening,

64
00:05:17,736 --> 00:05:19,336
it justifies their prejudice.

65
00:05:19,436 --> 00:05:23,603
They're just humans. They're
stupid and judjmental what's
the mystery?

66
00:05:23,703 --> 00:05:25,970
Their prejudice might not
threaten you,

67
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:28,303
but Goku and I have to wear
these little restraints,

68
00:05:28,403 --> 00:05:31,936
and not everyone in town may
look at it as just fashion.

69
00:05:32,036 --> 00:05:34,936
Huh. Speaking of him, where is
monkey boy?

70
00:05:35,036 --> 00:05:37,803
[Sanzo] Eating out doggy bags.
You can bet on it.

71
00:05:44,436 --> 00:05:46,270
[Houmei] Thanks for the help.
You're sweet.

72
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:49,970
[Goku] No problem. Sanzo's
fat butt means I get a lot
of practice.

73
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:53,436
[Houmei] I've had to do
everything by myself
since Ekitoku-

74
00:05:53,536 --> 00:05:54,703
Ekitoku?

75
00:05:56,003 --> 00:05:58,370
We've known each other since we
were kids.

76
00:06:00,036 --> 00:06:02,903
He was killed by a demon.

77
00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:11,703
Humans and demons should never
have been living together in the
first place!

78
00:06:11,803 --> 00:06:15,736
It's not natural! Just look at
everything that's happened!

79
00:06:15,836 --> 00:06:18,603
You agree with me, don't
you, Goku?!

80
00:06:18,703 --> 00:06:21,570
You know... uh... I- I don't
think... I mean...

81
00:06:24,603 --> 00:06:27,636
They're evil! Disgusting!

82
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:30,103
We should find a way to kill
every last one of them!

83
00:06:30,203 --> 00:06:31,136
Don't you think so?

84
00:06:31,236 --> 00:06:34,803
Um... Yeah.

85
00:06:37,936 --> 00:06:41,536
[Hakkai] Goku, you didn't tell
her anything, did you?

86
00:06:41,636 --> 00:06:43,903
I don't know if she'd handle it
all that well.

87
00:06:44,003 --> 00:06:46,103
I hear that.

88
00:06:46,203 --> 00:06:49,170
[Goku] Aw great the carnival's
in town.

89
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:51,470
[Gojyo] Oooh yeah.

90
00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:55,136
I'd like to show a couple of
those little carnival hotties

91
00:06:55,236 --> 00:06:57,570
what kind of action's going on
under my big top.

92
00:06:57,670 --> 00:06:58,770
[Hakkai blows a whistle]

93
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:00,703
Too much information!

94
00:07:07,636 --> 00:07:10,336
[Goku] The hotel's booked,
preacher man.

95
00:07:10,436 --> 00:07:14,670
But I had the foresight to book
a couple of vacant singles. So
you can say thank you now.

96
00:07:15,803 --> 00:07:17,870
"Thank you now"

97
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:21,570
I say we all stick together
tonight just in case the local
demon contingency

98
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:24,870
gets antsy and decides to go
for a midnight snack.

99
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:26,870
And if we do have to stick
together tonight,

100
00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:30,503
I'm afraid I'll need a little
"me time" before bed. Later.

101
00:07:30,603 --> 00:07:32,103
I can't wait.

102
00:07:32,203 --> 00:07:35,736
It warms my heart to see all of
us getting along with eachother
so well.

103
00:07:35,836 --> 00:07:36,970
Good times.

104
00:07:41,603 --> 00:07:44,536
[Yaone] I have news, Lord
Kougaiji, movement in the East.

105
00:07:44,636 --> 00:07:47,236
[Kougaiji] I know. Don't worry
about it.

106
00:07:47,336 --> 00:07:50,403
I've already sent someone to
take care of the little matter.

107
00:07:50,503 --> 00:07:52,903
Dispatched assasins,
I'm impressed.

108
00:07:54,936 --> 00:07:57,003
[Kougaiji] I'm doing this for
you, Mother.

109
00:07:57,103 --> 00:07:59,870
Don't worry, I'll release you
from this spell.

110
00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:02,170
I promise!

111
00:08:06,336 --> 00:08:09,470
[Goku snoring obnoxiously]

112
00:08:18,703 --> 00:08:21,636
[Man] Houmei, let me get the
rest. You go on to bed.

113
00:08:21,736 --> 00:08:23,403
Oh, I'm almost done.

114
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:27,803
[Man] Augh!

115
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:32,803
[Door opens]

116
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:55,003
Bastard, I'll kill you!

117
00:08:55,103 --> 00:08:56,803
[Sanzo] I don't think so.

118
00:08:56,903 --> 00:08:59,003
Pointed ears, a symbol
shamped birthmark...

119
00:08:59,103 --> 00:09:02,903
I'm gonna go out on a limb here
and say your pumps a little bit
darker than mine.

120
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:04,770
[Sanzo] o you know what this is?

121
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:06,503
A banishing gun!

122
00:09:06,603 --> 00:09:08,703
Well, it looks like word's
starting to get around.

123
00:09:08,803 --> 00:09:11,103
You guys are a little more
organized than I thought
you were.

124
00:09:11,203 --> 00:09:15,103
Alright then, if you know what
this then you know what it can
do. Right?

125
00:09:15,236 --> 00:09:19,003
You've got ten whole seconds
to tell me who's violated the
forbidden tenent,

126
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:21,936
and who's responcible for this
bloody little uprising.

127
00:09:22,603 --> 00:09:23,736
Too slow!

128
00:09:25,403 --> 00:09:28,503
You said ten seconds, that was
only two!

129
00:09:28,603 --> 00:09:31,603
I suck at math. Now tell me.

130
00:09:31,703 --> 00:09:35,536
I swear to the goddess, I don't
know who's behind this! I don't
know what you're talking about!

131
00:09:35,636 --> 00:09:38,870
I'm just following Kougaiji's
orders! I don't know anything!

132
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:40,136
<i>Kougaiji?!</i>

133
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:44,803
<i>Gyumaoh and Rasetsunyo's son.</i>

134
00:09:44,903 --> 00:09:47,436
<i>But when then Gyumaoh was put</i>
<i>down Kougaiji was supposed to</i>

135
00:09:47,570 --> 00:09:50,970
<i>be sealed away in India,</i>
<i>Houtou Castle.</i>

136
00:09:51,070 --> 00:09:53,103
<i>Who broke the seal and</i>
<i>freed him?</i>

137
00:09:53,203 --> 00:09:57,570
<i>Whoever broke that seal,</i>
<i>whoever freed him, that's</i>
<i>who's behind this.</i>

138
00:09:58,103 --> 00:09:59,770
Who is it?

139
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:02,336
You sure you want to waste all
this time trying to figure
it out?

140
00:10:03,836 --> 00:10:06,836
By the time you put it all
together your friends will
be dead!

141
00:10:06,936 --> 00:10:08,836
That is if they're not
dead already.

142
00:10:08,936 --> 00:10:12,470
Look you're being to generous in
assuming I care about their
safety that is.

143
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:15,770
They can take care of
themselves, I don't really
need to worry about- ugh!

144
00:10:22,503 --> 00:10:25,836
[Spider] I suppose you should be
less concerned with your friends

145
00:10:25,936 --> 00:10:28,803
and spend that time worry
about yourself.

146
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:32,803
[Sanzo] Houmei!

147
00:10:32,903 --> 00:10:37,403
I understand you're headed west,
well there's been a change
of plans,

148
00:10:37,503 --> 00:10:41,703
for you and your friends.
Now you're going south!

149
00:10:49,427 --> 00:10:50,560
[Knock at the door]

150
00:10:52,027 --> 00:10:53,627
Go away.

151
00:10:53,727 --> 00:10:56,693
I was hoping for a little
warmer welcome.

152
00:10:56,793 --> 00:10:59,360
Got room in that bed for two?

153
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:01,427
Yeah I think I can fit you in.

154
00:11:01,527 --> 00:11:02,193
[Glass breaking]

155
00:11:02,293 --> 00:11:03,893
A little noisy next door.

156
00:11:03,993 --> 00:11:07,293
Not nearly as noisy as it's
going to be in here.

157
00:11:07,393 --> 00:11:08,927
I can get pretty loud.

158
00:11:09,027 --> 00:11:10,727
Not a problem.

159
00:11:10,827 --> 00:11:15,560
[Gojoy] But I gotta ask you a
favor, can you maybe trim those
nails a little bit?

160
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,593
How did you know?!

161
00:11:22,693 --> 00:11:27,027
I was told you'd be to busy
trying to get laid to figure
out who I was.

162
00:11:27,127 --> 00:11:30,893
Sweetheart, when it comes to
my women...

163
00:11:30,993 --> 00:11:32,327
...I'm picky.

164
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:33,560
That's pretty lame,

165
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:35,093
you did everything but knock
over a vase

166
00:11:35,193 --> 00:11:36,593
to let me know you were coming.

167
00:11:36,693 --> 00:11:38,093
[Gojyo] Hakkai, you alright?

168
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:42,593
Mine was a little better looking
at least.

169
00:11:42,693 --> 00:11:44,693
[Hakkai] Whatever, did you
check Sanzo and Goku?

170
00:11:44,793 --> 00:11:46,960
Goku's next door. We check on
him first.

171
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:52,127
Are you all right, Goku?!

172
00:11:52,227 --> 00:11:55,493
What? I'm fine. I had the
weirdest dream.

173
00:11:55,593 --> 00:11:57,860
More like a nightmare,
my friend.

174
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:01,593
He did this in his sleep?
That's bullshit.

175
00:12:01,693 --> 00:12:06,093
I have to tell you, no one
has ever escaped from the
Dark Spider Clan.

176
00:12:06,193 --> 00:12:08,960
Not even priests I'm afraid.

177
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:13,327
<i>Black magic, illusions, I</i>
<i>should have seen her coming</i>
<i>a mile away.</i>

178
00:12:13,427 --> 00:12:14,860
<i>I'm getting lazy.</i>

179
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:19,427
Stop struggling and be a
good boy.

180
00:12:19,527 --> 00:12:22,227
And I just might let this
girl live.

181
00:12:22,327 --> 00:12:24,327
[Sanzo] You hurt her, you die.

182
00:12:29,393 --> 00:12:33,560
[Spider] Such spirit, seems
wasted on a human.

183
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:38,027
Legend has it that if you
consume a priest of high
virtue, you'll live longer.

184
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:42,560
Prehaps one ranked as high
as Sanzo could provide life
ever lasting.

185
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:45,293
Give or take a decade or two.

186
00:12:45,393 --> 00:12:50,860
To human women you must look
very handsome but to me,
you're dinner.

187
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:53,760
Up close like this you look
different, uglier.

188
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:56,127
I'll destroy you!

189
00:12:56,227 --> 00:12:59,227
I'll tear you into such tiny
little pieces, you won't be ab-

190
00:13:03,393 --> 00:13:07,327
I'd rethink the menu, honey.
That dish is a little sour.

191
00:13:07,427 --> 00:13:10,160
I think she's bitten off more
than she can chew.

192
00:13:12,327 --> 00:13:13,527
[Goku yawns]

193
00:13:13,627 --> 00:13:15,293
[Sanzo] If you're looking for a
thank you, keep searching.

194
00:13:15,393 --> 00:13:17,027
Wasn't really planning on it.

195
00:13:17,127 --> 00:13:20,493
But would you like a little help
taking her down?

196
00:13:20,593 --> 00:13:22,027
The more the merrier.

197
00:13:22,127 --> 00:13:23,393
Go ahead and try it!

198
00:13:23,493 --> 00:13:26,427
I'll spilt your little friend in
two before you take a step!

199
00:13:27,027 --> 00:13:28,160
Hmm...

200
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:31,960
Sounds like a challenge to me.

201
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:36,860
You're too slow lady, and
now that we have your
barganing chip...

202
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:39,393
How about you just surrender and
give up?

203
00:13:42,393 --> 00:13:43,593
Kill them all!

204
00:13:43,693 --> 00:13:45,793
Come on! I'm ready to end
this bullshit!

205
00:13:45,893 --> 00:13:48,093
Cause I'm sick of looking at
your ugly ass!

206
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:57,493
Nice job there, monkey boy.

207
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,393
Almost as nice as mine.

208
00:14:04,393 --> 00:14:06,493
And now... my turn.

209
00:14:17,993 --> 00:14:20,160
I'll kill you all one by one!

210
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,160
Well is that it? Huh?

211
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:27,393
Haven't you had enough?

212
00:14:27,493 --> 00:14:30,160
Oh I'm just getting started!

213
00:14:35,493 --> 00:14:36,527
Oh shit!

214
00:14:36,627 --> 00:14:38,027
Oh she's chaning!

215
00:14:43,227 --> 00:14:45,527
Eww! That's gross!

216
00:14:45,627 --> 00:14:48,360
Yeah, kinda hard to tell which
one of her is uglier.

217
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,127
Augh! This is nasty! Get this
shit off me!

218
00:14:54,227 --> 00:14:57,193
Her powers are increasing now
that she's changed into
another form.

219
00:15:01,593 --> 00:15:04,560
Wow, you're awake.
By timing, my dear.

220
00:15:07,893 --> 00:15:09,527
[Houmei screams]

221
00:15:12,627 --> 00:15:13,760
We're free.

222
00:15:15,927 --> 00:15:17,060
Houmei!

223
00:15:18,293 --> 00:15:19,427
Dad!

224
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,093
Oh dad!

225
00:15:21,993 --> 00:15:24,127
[Man] I believe this belongs
to you.

226
00:15:24,227 --> 00:15:27,260
Well I guess I owe you a
finder's fee then.

227
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,993
[Spider] Oh you'll pay!

228
00:15:29,093 --> 00:15:30,960
You'll all pay!

229
00:15:35,527 --> 00:15:36,960
Houmei, don't look at it!

230
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:44,327
Oh god! She's eating
her friends!

231
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:48,593
She's healing her wounds by
consuming their power.

232
00:15:52,593 --> 00:15:55,793
She likes to eat men.
She really is a spider.

233
00:15:59,793 --> 00:16:01,827
Come here little girl!

234
00:16:01,927 --> 00:16:03,127
[Goku] Back off!

235
00:16:03,227 --> 00:16:04,427
[Houmei] Goku no!

236
00:16:06,793 --> 00:16:11,627
Stop it! Why do you insist on
protecting them?! They're weak!

237
00:16:11,727 --> 00:16:15,560
You are of my kind! We are
the same!

238
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:16,793
What?

239
00:16:18,027 --> 00:16:23,127
<i>That can't be! He- He can't be!</i>

240
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,160
Goku, she's lying, right?

241
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:30,493
[Goku] What? Uh well, uh...
she's kinda on the level on
this one...

242
00:16:30,593 --> 00:16:34,293
So she's tell the truth. Liar.

243
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:39,427
You liar! How could you lie to
me, knowing how I feel?!

244
00:16:39,527 --> 00:16:40,660
Don't say that, Houmei!

245
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:43,427
Get away from me, you monster!

246
00:16:46,393 --> 00:16:47,527
[Sanzo] Goku!

247
00:16:56,793 --> 00:16:58,393
Everybody get back!

248
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:07,227
Stop this madness and join
forces with me!

249
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:12,593
We can rule the world with
Gyumaoh forever!

250
00:17:12,693 --> 00:17:14,060
[Goku] Not interested!

251
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:17,327
And stop looking at them like
they're different or
we're better!

252
00:17:17,427 --> 00:17:19,927
We're all the same! All of us!

253
00:17:20,027 --> 00:17:23,427
Well, except for the little fact
that they cook better than I do.

254
00:17:23,527 --> 00:17:25,160
<i>I mean it, thanks.</i>

255
00:17:26,027 --> 00:17:27,227
Oh Goku...

256
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:31,160
A little help here, come on
you guys!

257
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:33,493
[Sanzo] Hakkai, take care of
Houmei and her father.

258
00:17:33,593 --> 00:17:36,027
Gojyo, you help Goku, buy me
some time.

259
00:17:36,593 --> 00:17:37,627
[Gojyo] Done.

260
00:17:38,727 --> 00:17:41,727
A seal. Let's take her down.

261
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:45,360
Bring it on, spider lady!

262
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:48,093
You know, Houmei and her dad run
a really nice place here.

263
00:17:48,193 --> 00:17:49,793
except for the pest problem.

264
00:17:53,393 --> 00:17:55,793
[Houmei] Who are you?

265
00:17:55,893 --> 00:17:57,160
What are you?

266
00:17:57,260 --> 00:17:58,660
Houmei, the demons through out
the land

267
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:01,660
aren't doing these terrible
things for the thrill of it all.

268
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:04,460
Something is making them act
this way.

269
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:09,227
Some of them, anyway. You're
young becareful of blanket
judgements.

270
00:18:21,727 --> 00:18:24,293
Now's your chance man,
go get her!

271
00:18:24,393 --> 00:18:25,893
It's about time!

272
00:18:29,127 --> 00:18:31,693
Now maybe she'll get me point!

273
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:49,460
[Man] Leaving so soon?

274
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:52,760
[Hakkai] Yes. We've got a long
way to go.

275
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:56,493
I guess Houmei's not coming to
see us off.

276
00:18:56,593 --> 00:18:59,427
Probably not, not after
what happened yesterday.

277
00:18:59,893 --> 00:19:01,327
You're a liar!

278
00:19:01,427 --> 00:19:06,660
How could you do this me knowing
how I feel?! Liar! Liar!

279
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,393
[Houmei] Goku, wait!

280
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:17,593
Hey you're here!

281
00:19:17,693 --> 00:19:21,193
It's not much. Just a little
something to say I'm sorry.

282
00:19:21,293 --> 00:19:24,793
Goku, please forgive me if
you can.

283
00:19:24,893 --> 00:19:28,993
I'm sorry, I was wrong about
you. Do you forgive me?

284
00:19:29,093 --> 00:19:30,493
[Goku] Yeah!

285
00:19:31,793 --> 00:19:32,927
Thank you!

286
00:19:39,293 --> 00:19:44,827
Father, I was so wrong. Do you
think the others will be able to
forgive me?

287
00:19:44,927 --> 00:19:49,193
Of course, but not until you're
able to forgive yourself.

288
00:19:49,293 --> 00:19:52,960
It's hard to accept those who
are differnt from ourselves.

289
00:19:53,093 --> 00:19:56,360
<i>[Goku] And stop looking at them</i>
<i>like they're different or</i>
<i>we're better!</i>

290
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:59,027
<i>We're all the same! All of us!</i>

291
00:20:04,993 --> 00:20:09,560
[Man] Maybe one day we will all
be able to live as brothers.

292
00:20:15,374 --> 00:20:18,574
You know what this means. They
know what are plans are.

293
00:20:18,674 --> 00:20:21,741
Stop the resurrection, and this
Kougaiji guy.

294
00:20:21,841 --> 00:20:25,408
Seems like we've got enemies
being freed and resurrected
all over the place.

295
00:20:25,508 --> 00:20:27,774
[Gojyo] Yeah, this stuff
aint bad.
[Goku] Hey get your hands off!

296
00:20:27,874 --> 00:20:29,608
[Sanzo] I'm sorry I can't
concentrate.
[Goku] This isn't for you!
[Gojyo] Like hell it's not!

297
00:20:29,708 --> 00:20:30,908
[Gojyo] She gave it to all
of us!
[Sanzo] Not with those two
morons in the back.

298
00:20:31,008 --> 00:20:31,708
[Goku] No she didn't! She gave
it to me!

299
00:20:31,808 --> 00:20:33,708
I'm trying to ignore them.

300
00:20:33,808 --> 00:20:35,708
[Sanzo] Really? How's it going?

301
00:20:35,808 --> 00:20:36,608
[Hakkai] Not so good.

302
00:20:36,708 --> 00:20:37,908
[Goku] Give it back!
That's mine!

303
00:20:38,008 --> 00:20:40,241
[Gojyo] You know you're a real
selfish pain in the ass.

304
00:20:40,341 --> 00:20:42,774
[Goku] Hahahaha! Suck it!

305
00:22:25,808 --> 00:22:27,908
[Goku] OK, this is bullshit!
There's no meat,

306
00:22:28,008 --> 00:22:30,741
there's no fish, we have to
bring our own beer!

307
00:22:30,841 --> 00:22:33,141
This trip is getting worse
and worse!

308
00:22:33,241 --> 00:22:37,574
Last time it's a hotel crawling
with demons, this time it's a
bunch of stuffy monks!

309
00:22:37,674 --> 00:22:41,108
I don't know what's worse:
what's in here, or what's
out there.

310
00:22:41,208 --> 00:22:42,708
[Gojyo] Shut up and tell 'em
the title.

311
00:22:42,808 --> 00:22:45,574
[Goku] "His God, My God." Happy?

312
00:22:45,674 --> 00:22:46,908
[Gojyo] Delirious.
