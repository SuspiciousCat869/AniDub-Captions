1
00:02:05,074 --> 00:02:07,074
[Goku] "The Price of Devotion."

2
00:02:13,874 --> 00:02:15,341
[Gojyo] Man, what
a pathetic town.

3
00:02:15,441 --> 00:02:18,341
[Goku] You think we'll find
anything to eat around here?

4
00:02:20,141 --> 00:02:23,707
[Hakkai] Hey, is it just
me or does that castle give
anyone else the creeps?

5
00:02:24,574 --> 00:02:27,241
[Gojyo] What's going
on over there?

6
00:02:27,341 --> 00:02:29,341
[Hakkai] Looks like
some kind of ceremony.

7
00:02:29,441 --> 00:02:32,307
[Gojyo] Maybe we'll get
to see a nice bon dance
tonight then, huh?

8
00:02:32,407 --> 00:02:36,541
[Goku] Ooh! And I'll
bet they'll have food
stands too! I'm hungry!

9
00:02:36,641 --> 00:02:39,241
[Gojyo] I could use some
fried noodles right about now.

10
00:02:39,341 --> 00:02:42,107
You are outsiders.

11
00:02:43,807 --> 00:02:47,207
We are just simple travelers
on our way to the west.

12
00:02:47,307 --> 00:02:49,341
So what is this procession?

13
00:02:49,441 --> 00:02:53,274
[Old Man] It is the final
farewell to the woman
who will be sacrificed.

14
00:02:54,141 --> 00:02:55,674
Sacrificed?!

15
00:02:55,774 --> 00:02:58,007
You see that castle there?

16
00:02:58,107 --> 00:03:03,507
Every year, the town offers
someone to the demon who
lives in that dark place.

17
00:03:03,607 --> 00:03:05,007
[Goku] What's up with that?

18
00:03:05,107 --> 00:03:08,207
[Gojyo] I thought human
sacrifices went out of
style some time ago.

19
00:03:08,307 --> 00:03:12,041
[Old Man] Surely you
can see the large cannon
staring down at us.

20
00:03:12,141 --> 00:03:15,041
They can wipe out this town
in the blink of an eye.

21
00:03:15,141 --> 00:03:18,441
We have no choice but
to submit to their demands.

22
00:03:18,541 --> 00:03:20,941
Why don't you just move away?

23
00:03:21,041 --> 00:03:23,807
It's the water.

24
00:03:23,907 --> 00:03:27,507
Surrounded by desert, they
can't leave without the water.

25
00:03:27,607 --> 00:03:31,107
That beast controls the only
source of water in our little

26
00:03:31,207 --> 00:03:35,974
town. With that cannon, and
nothing but sand stretching

27
00:03:36,074 --> 00:03:39,474
for miles in every direction,
we live in a prison.

28
00:03:39,574 --> 00:03:43,241
How stupid! You can
get rid of a demon.

29
00:04:22,507 --> 00:04:25,307
Goodbye, Gonou.

30
00:04:25,407 --> 00:04:28,774
[Goku] Hakkai? Hello! You there?

31
00:04:32,874 --> 00:04:34,974
[Woman] Mind your own business.

32
00:04:35,074 --> 00:04:37,341
[Townspeople chatter
irritatedly in the background]

33
00:04:39,974 --> 00:04:42,274
I'm sorry to be like this
everyone, but I can't let you
take this woman any further.

34
00:04:45,974 --> 00:04:46,941
[Man] What the hell?

35
00:04:47,074 --> 00:04:50,907
[More disgruntled speaking
from the crowds]

36
00:04:51,007 --> 00:04:54,674
I can't let you go through with
this stupid act of cruelty.

37
00:04:54,774 --> 00:04:59,207
I know all too well what
it means to have someone
you love sacrificed.

38
00:04:59,307 --> 00:05:01,941
Dumbass! Move! Get
out of the way!

39
00:05:02,974 --> 00:05:04,607
Or else what?

40
00:05:05,174 --> 00:05:07,074
That does it!

41
00:05:07,174 --> 00:05:08,307
[Sanzo fires his gun]

42
00:05:12,907 --> 00:05:14,907
Okay gentlemen.

43
00:05:15,007 --> 00:05:16,707
Who's in charge here?

44
00:05:19,341 --> 00:05:21,607
[Mayor] That is NOT the
issue here, gentlemen.

45
00:05:21,707 --> 00:05:23,941
You see, I understand
what you're getting at.

46
00:05:24,041 --> 00:05:25,007
[Hakkai] Great. Then...

47
00:05:25,107 --> 00:05:27,374
The answer's still no.

48
00:05:27,474 --> 00:05:29,407
Jeez, who elected this wuss?

49
00:05:29,507 --> 00:05:32,774
We're in a village
full of total losers.

50
00:05:33,441 --> 00:05:35,074
[Hakkai] May I ask why?

51
00:05:35,174 --> 00:05:39,207
[Mayor] No one forced Houfa
into this. She willingly chose

52
00:05:39,307 --> 00:05:43,074
to give her life for the sake
of everyone else living here.

53
00:05:43,174 --> 00:05:46,307
And I intend to honor her
wishes. It's the least I

54
00:05:46,407 --> 00:05:50,807
can do for a brave soul such
as hers. Please understand.

55
00:05:50,907 --> 00:05:54,974
I have the welfare of the
entire community to consider.

56
00:05:55,074 --> 00:05:58,841
I see then. I've
heard quite enough.

57
00:05:58,941 --> 00:06:04,674
You all are despicable.
How can you let a woman
die to save yourselves?

58
00:06:04,774 --> 00:06:07,474
At least that bastard in the
castle knows he's a demon!

59
00:06:07,574 --> 00:06:10,507
How dare you! I'm only
thinking of the townspeople.

60
00:06:10,607 --> 00:06:16,874
You're thinking of yourself!
If you really care so much for
your townspeople, mayor...

61
00:06:16,974 --> 00:06:21,141
then why are you so eager to
send one of them to their
grave, you hipocrite!

62
00:06:21,241 --> 00:06:24,941
Bastard! Who are you
to sit in judgment?

63
00:06:25,041 --> 00:06:30,274
Do you honestly believe I
want to hand my fiance over to
that monster any less than you?

64
00:06:30,374 --> 00:06:33,641
Do you really think I'd do that
if there were any other way?

65
00:06:33,741 --> 00:06:41,274
Do you?! You have no idea
how strong they are. We're
all just trying to stay alive.

66
00:06:43,307 --> 00:06:47,541
Oh really? You would gladly hand
your fiance over to that demon,

67
00:06:47,641 --> 00:06:50,541
and you still have the gall
to call yourself alive?

68
00:06:51,907 --> 00:06:53,174
How dare you!

69
00:06:53,274 --> 00:06:54,674
Will you please stop it?!

70
00:06:58,174 --> 00:07:01,874
Just cut it out, please.
I can't take it.

71
00:07:07,207 --> 00:07:11,507
[Gobku] Hey, what's the
matter, Hakkai? You've
been acting weird lately.

72
00:07:12,374 --> 00:07:14,174
Hello? Hakkai!

73
00:07:14,274 --> 00:07:17,341
[Gojyo] Will you please shut up.
[Goku] What for?

74
00:07:17,441 --> 00:07:21,241
Because sometimes grown-ups have
uh, grown-up issues, that's why.

75
00:07:21,341 --> 00:07:23,307
Issues? What's that?

76
00:07:23,407 --> 00:07:25,607
It's a reason for you
to shut your trap.

77
00:07:25,707 --> 00:07:28,941
Now what's your problem, Sanzo?

78
00:07:29,041 --> 00:07:32,907
[Hakkai] Goku's right.
It isn't like me, is it?

79
00:07:33,841 --> 00:07:35,341
So what's wrong?

80
00:07:37,041 --> 00:07:41,374
She looked like... my Kanan.

81
00:07:45,707 --> 00:07:48,441
Who's Kanan?

82
00:07:48,541 --> 00:07:50,274
[Gojyo] So, what're
you going to do, huh?

83
00:07:51,774 --> 00:07:55,374
C'mon, man. You've got to have
something cooking, am I right?

84
00:07:55,474 --> 00:07:57,107
Let me in on it.

85
00:07:57,207 --> 00:07:59,107
Me too! Me too!

86
00:08:00,907 --> 00:08:02,974
Everyone...

87
00:08:03,074 --> 00:08:05,874
You guys are just
too much, I swear.

88
00:08:29,607 --> 00:08:30,741
[Fiance] Houfa...

89
00:08:31,641 --> 00:08:32,774
Houfa...

90
00:08:34,174 --> 00:08:35,307
I just...

91
00:09:04,107 --> 00:09:08,474
[Hakkai] Kind of
chilly, isn't it?

92
00:09:08,574 --> 00:09:12,107
I was wondering, would it
be too presumptuous of me...

93
00:09:12,207 --> 00:09:15,974
to ask you... to ask you to
come run away with me now?

94
00:09:16,807 --> 00:09:18,741
I can't do that.

95
00:09:18,841 --> 00:09:21,807
I'm afraid someone else will
just have to take my place.

96
00:09:21,907 --> 00:09:24,907
That's what I thought.
And that's why I've already

97
00:09:25,007 --> 00:09:28,441
come up with a plan
to fix everything.

98
00:09:28,541 --> 00:09:30,707
[Houfa] This is not
your concern, so please,

99
00:09:30,807 --> 00:09:33,107
just be on your
way. Don't worry,

100
00:09:33,207 --> 00:09:35,207
I don't intend to go
down without a fight.

101
00:09:36,841 --> 00:09:39,574
[Hakkai] Please trust us.
Together we have a much

102
00:09:39,674 --> 00:09:42,674
better chance than anything you
could try to do on your own.

103
00:09:43,341 --> 00:09:45,607
[Houfa] But...

104
00:09:45,707 --> 00:09:49,941
[Hakkai] We may not look it,
but we can put up a pretty
good fight, you know.

105
00:09:50,041 --> 00:09:52,241
Why would you bother to help me?

106
00:09:52,341 --> 00:09:54,074
Why does it matter?

107
00:09:54,174 --> 00:09:56,507
Trust me, I have my reasons.

108
00:09:56,607 --> 00:09:58,541
There's no way I could let you.

109
00:09:59,574 --> 00:10:01,307
You are just like her.

110
00:10:02,374 --> 00:10:07,974
I swear. This is just how
it happened with her.

111
00:10:08,074 --> 00:10:13,041
How I tried. I did things,
horrible things to save her.

112
00:10:13,141 --> 00:10:17,007
But in the end, I just
couldn't be strong enough.

113
00:10:17,107 --> 00:10:22,974
So that's why... I'm
sorry. I didn't know.

114
00:10:23,074 --> 00:10:28,007
Yep. Now you know it's
all about me, and my big
bruised male ego-

115
00:10:34,307 --> 00:10:37,174
[Houfa] I may not understand
everything you've been through,

116
00:10:37,274 --> 00:10:40,241
but I do know this.

117
00:10:40,341 --> 00:10:42,107
You've saved me.

118
00:10:43,241 --> 00:10:44,641
You've saved me.

119
00:10:47,507 --> 00:10:48,807
Kanan...

120
00:10:54,907 --> 00:10:59,307
Oh yeah, by the way.
I don't suppose you're
any good at cooking?

121
00:10:59,407 --> 00:11:01,041
[Houfa] I suppose...

122
00:11:01,141 --> 00:11:02,574
Oh, thank goodness!

123
00:11:02,674 --> 00:11:05,541
We haven't had anything to
eat in quite a few days,

124
00:11:05,641 --> 00:11:10,474
so... if you wouldn't mind
feeding us as soon as this is
all over, that would be great.

125
00:11:10,574 --> 00:11:12,541
[Houfa] Yes, gladly!

126
00:11:12,641 --> 00:11:14,941
I'll take a fat steak!

127
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:17,407
[Gojyo] Good job, primate!
You blew our cover!

128
00:11:18,074 --> 00:11:19,207
[Sanzo] My turn.

129
00:11:19,774 --> 00:11:20,907
[Goku screams]

130
00:11:21,707 --> 00:11:23,341
How embarassing.

131
00:11:26,007 --> 00:11:27,874
It's quite alright.

132
00:11:29,941 --> 00:11:34,341
<i>[Hakkai] Watch out up there.</i>
<i>I don't plan to fail twice.</i>

133
00:12:17,875 --> 00:12:19,675
Now that's eye catching.

134
00:12:36,142 --> 00:12:37,975
Here she is.

135
00:12:43,508 --> 00:12:46,342
[Goon 1] I hear the latest
sacrifice is a real hottie.

136
00:12:46,442 --> 00:12:50,242
[Goon 2] Who cares? Like any
of us will ever get any of that.

137
00:12:50,342 --> 00:12:51,975
[Goon 1] Oh, you
can say that again.

138
00:12:53,575 --> 00:12:56,375
What do we have here?

139
00:12:56,475 --> 00:12:58,042
[Goon 2] What is it?

140
00:12:58,142 --> 00:13:05,475
[Goon 1] Wait a sec. He's got a
scripture, and a crimson chakra.

141
00:13:05,575 --> 00:13:08,908
Oh shit. Genjo Sanzo.

142
00:13:12,075 --> 00:13:14,975
[Baron] I've been waiting
for little lady.

143
00:13:19,808 --> 00:13:23,775
[Sanzo] Aw, shucks. All
these people here to see me?

144
00:13:23,875 --> 00:13:25,608
What would you say? A hundred?

145
00:13:25,708 --> 00:13:28,275
Awesome! Awesome!

146
00:13:28,375 --> 00:13:30,008
Ay yai yai.

147
00:13:34,008 --> 00:13:40,142
Come. Don't be shy.
Let's get a look at that
pretty little face of yours.

148
00:13:46,675 --> 00:13:49,908
Don't tell me you didn't see
this one coming. Oh well.

149
00:13:50,008 --> 00:13:53,042
So how about it, tall, dark,
handsome, and horrible?

150
00:13:53,142 --> 00:13:55,275
I do hope you're
into the rough stuff!

151
00:13:55,375 --> 00:13:58,442
I can't believe you're all
just going to sit in here!

152
00:13:58,542 --> 00:14:01,608
While these others do
all the fighting for you!

153
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:03,708
Well, I guess that's
one way to look at it.

154
00:14:03,808 --> 00:14:05,875
[Man] They're probably
dead now anyway.

155
00:14:18,775 --> 00:14:20,842
[Mayor] One of them could
be related to someone here,

156
00:14:20,942 --> 00:14:23,875
so in a sense, townspeople
are doing the fighting.

157
00:14:23,975 --> 00:14:27,208
That does it! I'll go
fight them on my own!

158
00:14:29,275 --> 00:14:30,942
Hold it.

159
00:14:37,508 --> 00:14:39,675
I won't let those
strangers show me up.

160
00:14:43,175 --> 00:14:47,675
[Baron] What were they
thinking, sending a man
to do a woman's job?

161
00:14:47,775 --> 00:14:51,975
Very well, time to
learn obedience!

162
00:14:57,342 --> 00:15:00,142
[Gojyo] My, my. They sure
are having a good time.

163
00:15:01,475 --> 00:15:04,075
Okay then...

164
00:15:04,175 --> 00:15:08,475
Gojyo, I would like you you
to destroy the castle battery.

165
00:15:08,575 --> 00:15:14,442
But since stealth is required,
I need you to reach the cannon
without being detected.

166
00:15:14,542 --> 00:15:18,142
[Gojyo] Problem is, I'm
a hard guy not to notice.

167
00:15:18,242 --> 00:15:22,975
Sanzo and Goku, you two are the
decoys. The way I figure it is,

168
00:15:23,075 --> 00:15:25,008
when they see a
Sanzo approaching,

169
00:15:25,108 --> 00:15:27,108
they'll be too focused on
fighting you to use the

170
00:15:27,208 --> 00:15:29,675
cannon to level the
town. Now let's do this!

171
00:15:33,875 --> 00:15:35,808
How did I get talked into this?

172
00:15:40,075 --> 00:15:42,275
Sanzo, how many ya got?

173
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:43,842
That makes eighteen.

174
00:15:43,942 --> 00:15:46,408
Beat you! I got twenty!

175
00:15:46,508 --> 00:15:49,242
Sixty more. Better get on it.

176
00:15:49,342 --> 00:15:50,975
You got it!

177
00:16:02,108 --> 00:16:05,508
Well then, I guess I'll just
take care of this thing.

178
00:16:05,608 --> 00:16:07,775
[Baron Jr.] Not so
fast there, pea.

179
00:16:13,075 --> 00:16:15,042
You're all such amateurs.

180
00:16:15,142 --> 00:16:19,908
Any fool can figure out
that ruckus outside was
only meant to be a diversion.

181
00:16:20,008 --> 00:16:22,208
Huh, your mistake is...

182
00:16:22,308 --> 00:16:25,475
to think you can face
me all by yourself.

183
00:16:25,575 --> 00:16:26,775
Is that so?

184
00:16:26,875 --> 00:16:28,008
Don' worry about it.

185
00:16:28,108 --> 00:16:31,542
You won't be the
first or the last.

186
00:16:31,642 --> 00:16:32,908
We'll see about that!

187
00:16:36,508 --> 00:16:38,975
Come on. You call that a hit?

188
00:16:39,075 --> 00:16:43,475
But I'm too hungry to
put any strength into it.

189
00:16:43,575 --> 00:16:45,742
Oh, come on, pussy boy.

190
00:16:52,475 --> 00:16:53,608
Hey!

191
00:17:02,442 --> 00:17:04,408
[Goon 1] Your highness!
[Goon 2] Who is that?!

192
00:17:04,508 --> 00:17:07,708
The cannon, get on it
and blast the town.

193
00:17:07,808 --> 00:17:08,942
Uh oh...

194
00:17:11,975 --> 00:17:13,508
[Baron Jr.] You're
not going anywhere.

195
00:17:13,608 --> 00:17:16,242
[Gojyo] I never said I was.

196
00:17:16,342 --> 00:17:18,742
[Goon 1] Ready to
fire, your highness!

197
00:17:18,842 --> 00:17:20,575
Then start firing!

198
00:17:26,808 --> 00:17:28,975
So, what's up, longhair?

199
00:17:29,075 --> 00:17:30,942
Well, what do you know?

200
00:17:31,042 --> 00:17:37,042
It looks like the people of
this town are alive afterall.

201
00:17:37,142 --> 00:17:41,275
[Baron Jr.] You foolish
morons! You only brought
death to you all!

202
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:44,142
Didn't I tell you
you couldn't beat me?!

203
00:17:47,642 --> 00:17:50,575
Ha! Idiot! You missed
me by a mile!

204
00:17:58,742 --> 00:18:02,208
And that, my friend, is that.

205
00:18:25,389 --> 00:18:27,556
<i>[Sanzo] Now it's all</i>
<i>up to you, Hakkai.</i>

206
00:18:29,923 --> 00:18:33,423
[Baron] Don't tell me you're
worn out already, boy?

207
00:18:36,856 --> 00:18:39,356
[Hakkai] Listen. You hear that?
[Baron] So what?

208
00:18:39,456 --> 00:18:42,589
[Hakkai] That's the sound
of your impending doom.

209
00:18:42,689 --> 00:18:44,623
Your cannon has been destroyed.

210
00:18:44,723 --> 00:18:49,789
And at this very moment,
the townspeople approaching,
seeking their revenge.

211
00:18:49,889 --> 00:18:52,789
And now, you are
all that's left!

212
00:18:54,156 --> 00:18:55,889
I will kill you all!

213
00:18:55,989 --> 00:18:57,489
Die!

214
00:19:09,723 --> 00:19:12,356
[Baron] You can't defeat me!

215
00:19:14,623 --> 00:19:17,323
[Hakkai] You've lived
for far too long!

216
00:19:18,889 --> 00:19:20,123
And now you die!

217
00:19:31,123 --> 00:19:34,489
[Mayor] I thank you all.
We had become so accustomed

218
00:19:34,589 --> 00:19:38,856
to obeying that we had forgotten
that we choose our own fates.

219
00:19:38,956 --> 00:19:41,656
And it's about time, mayor.

220
00:19:41,756 --> 00:19:46,089
Yeah, because you won't
always have us around
to bail you out of trouble.

221
00:19:47,656 --> 00:19:50,323
[Houfa] You risked
so much fight for us.

222
00:19:52,023 --> 00:19:54,156
But I...

223
00:19:54,256 --> 00:19:56,823
Sure am so glad
you did choose to.

224
00:19:56,923 --> 00:20:01,123
Yeah. Well, I didn't
realize he'd be so tough.

225
00:20:01,223 --> 00:20:03,689
[Fiance] And I didn't
realize he was so weak.

226
00:20:03,789 --> 00:20:08,023
I see now that we defeated
ourselves by not even
tying to fight back.

227
00:20:08,123 --> 00:20:12,023
No one's going to take you
away from me again without
a fight, I promise.

228
00:20:15,889 --> 00:20:17,923
[Goku] Hungry...

229
00:20:18,989 --> 00:20:21,023
I'm so damn hungry.

230
00:20:21,123 --> 00:20:22,989
Must have food.

231
00:20:25,023 --> 00:20:28,689
Control yourself! Glutton!

232
00:20:28,789 --> 00:20:32,523
All right. I will
fix you a feast.

233
00:20:32,623 --> 00:20:35,156
[Goku] Steak! I want steak!

234
00:20:35,256 --> 00:20:38,756
[Gojyo] How about grilled
monkey? I can fillet
you one real cheap.

235
00:20:38,856 --> 00:20:41,756
[Goku] Did you say something,
water sprite? I can't hear you!

236
00:20:41,856 --> 00:20:43,889
[Gojyo] He plays with
himself in his sleep!

237
00:20:43,989 --> 00:20:45,156
[Goku] I do not!

238
00:20:45,256 --> 00:20:47,056
[Gojyo] Seems to
hear alright to me!

239
00:20:47,156 --> 00:20:48,289
[Sanzo] Enough!

240
00:22:26,123 --> 00:22:28,823
[Gojyo] I can't stand
to see a woman cry.

241
00:22:28,923 --> 00:22:31,623
It always reminds of
the one who raised me.

242
00:22:31,723 --> 00:22:35,489
Tears she shed as she cradled
a tiny baby in her arms.

243
00:22:35,589 --> 00:22:39,623
Her eyes lowered, the look
of sorrow in her eyes.

244
00:22:39,723 --> 00:22:43,023
What did she see when she looked
down at that innocent child?

245
00:22:43,123 --> 00:22:47,356
Next time on Saiyuki,
discover my "Blood Bond."
