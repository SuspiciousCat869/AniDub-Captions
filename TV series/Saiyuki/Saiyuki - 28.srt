1
00:01:41,755 --> 00:01:46,874
[Goku] Hey! Did you eat my
potsticker without asking me?!

2
00:01:46,874 --> 00:01:48,574
[Gojyo] No, I didn't.

3
00:01:48,674 --> 00:01:51,974
Does a low IQ affect
your eyesight as well?

4
00:01:52,074 --> 00:01:54,241
What did you say, dumb elf?!

5
00:01:54,341 --> 00:01:56,708
It's not like I need
your permission.

6
00:01:56,808 --> 00:02:01,074
That potsticker belongs to
everyone who is sitting
at this table, yanno.

7
00:02:01,208 --> 00:02:04,841
Don't give me that bullshit!
That was the last one!

8
00:02:04,941 --> 00:02:07,474
I was saving it! It was
right here on my plate!

9
00:02:07,574 --> 00:02:09,874
[Gojyo] I didn't see
your name written on it.

10
00:02:09,974 --> 00:02:12,474
It's fair game until you
put it in your mouth.

11
00:02:12,574 --> 00:02:13,574
[Goku growls]

12
00:02:13,674 --> 00:02:15,474
So, you DID take my potsticker!

13
00:02:15,574 --> 00:02:17,708
ALRIGHT! Outside!

14
00:02:17,808 --> 00:02:21,441
[Gojyo] Oh, so you want
a piece of me? I'll make
you cry like a baby.

15
00:02:21,541 --> 00:02:24,041
That sure is a rowdy
group over there.

16
00:02:24,141 --> 00:02:26,041
Man. They must be brothers.

17
00:02:26,141 --> 00:02:27,874
They sure as hell
don't look alike.

18
00:02:27,974 --> 00:02:31,974
[Sanzo fires his gun]

19
00:02:32,074 --> 00:02:34,908
Will you two shut up?!
Do you want to die?!

20
00:02:38,141 --> 00:02:41,108
Now, if you are quite finished,
will you sit down?

21
00:02:41,208 --> 00:02:43,074
[Goku] But Sanzo!
[Gojyo] This monkey...

22
00:02:43,174 --> 00:02:44,541
Shut up.

23
00:02:48,708 --> 00:02:51,741
Hey, isn't that a monk's
robe he's got on?

24
00:02:51,841 --> 00:02:52,741
Yeah.

25
00:02:52,841 --> 00:02:54,708
[Man] And he just
fired a gun, right?

26
00:02:54,808 --> 00:02:55,241
Yeah.

27
00:02:55,241 --> 00:02:56,374
Hello.

28
00:02:57,141 --> 00:02:58,941
Wha-wha-what do you want?!

29
00:02:59,041 --> 00:03:03,141
Pardon me for interupting,
I just wanted to make sure
we didn't shoot anyone.

30
00:03:03,241 --> 00:03:05,008
[Man 2] Uh no, w-we're fine.

31
00:03:05,108 --> 00:03:09,474
I'm so glad to hear that.
Thanks for your understanding.

32
00:03:09,574 --> 00:03:11,874
People can be so
uptight these days.

33
00:03:13,341 --> 00:03:15,308
[Sanzo] Come on, we're leaving.

34
00:03:15,941 --> 00:03:17,074
Ciao!

35
00:03:21,641 --> 00:03:24,808
[Goku] But there's still
some spring rolls left!
[Gojyo] Beer!

36
00:03:24,908 --> 00:03:27,608
[Hakkai] Yes, yes, I know.
But if we don't hurry,

37
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:29,108
Sanzo really will shoot us.

38
00:03:29,208 --> 00:03:29,974
[Goku] Spring rolls!

39
00:03:30,074 --> 00:03:31,308
[Gojyo] Beer!

40
00:03:31,408 --> 00:03:32,241
[Sanzo] Slow pokes!

41
00:03:32,341 --> 00:03:34,608
[Sanzo shoots his
gun repeatedly]

42
00:03:34,708 --> 00:03:36,208
[Jeep drives away]

43
00:03:39,008 --> 00:03:40,941
Okay. That was weird.

44
00:03:52,774 --> 00:03:56,774
Heh. Not too bad as far as
demon architecture goes.

45
00:03:56,874 --> 00:04:01,508
I'm willing to bet this is
the central stronghold for
the entire demon movement.

46
00:04:01,608 --> 00:04:06,008
I don't see what's so
special about it. It's
in the middle of nowhere.

47
00:04:06,108 --> 00:04:08,574
Homura seems to
like it just fine.

48
00:04:08,674 --> 00:04:12,808
Yeah, well, I can't say I always
agree with the man's tastes.

49
00:04:12,908 --> 00:04:14,874
[Soldier] Lord Zenon!

50
00:04:15,008 --> 00:04:20,008
Special Forces Earth Detachment
of the Heavenly Army, ready to
storm the castle, sir.

51
00:04:20,108 --> 00:04:22,541
I'm afraid we won't
be needing you.

52
00:04:22,641 --> 00:04:23,474
[Soldier] Sir?

53
00:04:23,574 --> 00:04:25,808
Homura will storm it alone.

54
00:04:25,908 --> 00:04:28,274
[Soldier] Alone?! Surely
he can't expect to take

55
00:04:28,374 --> 00:04:31,308
the entire castle without
some assistance.

56
00:04:31,408 --> 00:04:35,574
You should know, the Prince
of War has always fought
his own battles.

57
00:04:35,674 --> 00:04:39,374
Just as Lord Nataku
fought alone before him.

58
00:04:39,474 --> 00:04:40,774
[Soldier] But sir, we...

59
00:04:40,874 --> 00:04:43,008
Shut up and watch, will ya?

60
00:04:43,108 --> 00:04:44,841
[Soldier] Uh, yes sir.

61
00:04:58,174 --> 00:05:00,474
[Goku] "The Rise
of the Rebellion."

62
00:05:20,641 --> 00:05:24,541
Well look. You can see Mount
Ryokai all the way from here.

63
00:05:24,641 --> 00:05:27,608
And then look east,
and you can see Ch'ang.

64
00:05:27,708 --> 00:05:31,208
That is quite a view
you have here, demon.

65
00:05:31,308 --> 00:05:35,308
And what exactly does
the War God want with us?

66
00:05:35,408 --> 00:05:40,841
[Homura] Houtou Castle, it
must be that way. Too bad
you can't see it from here.

67
00:05:40,941 --> 00:05:46,408
You are a god. Tell me what
business you have meddling in
the lower affairs of the Earth.

68
00:05:46,508 --> 00:05:50,074
If you're not here to
enslave us, then what
precisely do you want?

69
00:05:50,174 --> 00:05:52,441
This is quite a
tower you've built.

70
00:05:52,541 --> 00:05:59,774
Does it make you feel
more like gods, sitting
so close to heaven, demon?

71
00:05:59,874 --> 00:06:02,808
Touching, in its own way,
how you grovel around,

72
00:06:02,908 --> 00:06:05,508
striving to reach
for the unattainable.

73
00:06:05,608 --> 00:06:07,308
I really feel for you.

74
00:06:07,408 --> 00:06:09,541
What is it you want?

75
00:06:09,641 --> 00:06:16,341
What do I want? Why I want
nothing more than to help you
achieve your dreams, Gairu.

76
00:06:16,441 --> 00:06:18,408
To achieve our dreams?

77
00:06:18,508 --> 00:06:21,941
That's right. I want
to make you all gods.

78
00:06:22,941 --> 00:06:24,941
What? Have you gone mad?

79
00:06:25,041 --> 00:06:27,241
[Homura] Yes, perhaps I have.

80
00:06:27,374 --> 00:06:29,641
Sorry to have bothered
you. I'll be on my way.

81
00:06:29,741 --> 00:06:32,408
Wait. Do you mean what
you say? Do you?

82
00:06:34,408 --> 00:06:37,641
[Homura] I guess you have
no way of knowing, do you?

83
00:06:37,741 --> 00:06:40,708
You truly can transform
us into gods?

84
00:06:40,808 --> 00:06:43,974
[Homura] I can.
On one condition.

85
00:06:44,074 --> 00:06:45,408
[Gairu] Name it.

86
00:06:45,508 --> 00:06:49,741
You must promise to be
my faithful subjects.

87
00:06:49,841 --> 00:06:53,774
So we would all become
servants of the War Prince?

88
00:06:53,874 --> 00:06:56,108
[Homura] Do not make
this decision lightly.

89
00:06:56,208 --> 00:06:59,941
There is no turning back
from this road once you
have started down it.

90
00:07:00,041 --> 00:07:03,808
If you agree, you will
never be yourselves again.

91
00:07:07,508 --> 00:07:10,408
What? What kind of army
would surround us?

92
00:07:13,741 --> 00:07:16,574
I see that you drive
a hard bargain.

93
00:07:16,674 --> 00:07:19,074
Alright, we will
accept your offer.

94
00:07:20,908 --> 00:07:22,541
As you wish.

95
00:07:32,141 --> 00:07:33,774
Confer divinity.

96
00:07:51,508 --> 00:07:54,041
I think I respected
you more before.

97
00:07:54,141 --> 00:08:00,041
At least then you were living
on your own terms even as you
were seeking your divinity.

98
00:08:00,141 --> 00:08:04,308
It's better to be free on Earth
than slaves in the heavens.

99
00:08:04,408 --> 00:08:08,174
I'm afraid you'll learn
that soon enough.

100
00:08:08,308 --> 00:08:13,141
So, my fellow immortals,
now not even death...

101
00:08:13,241 --> 00:08:15,941
can break you out
of this prison.

102
00:08:19,008 --> 00:08:20,741
Well don't just stand there.

103
00:08:20,841 --> 00:08:24,208
It's time to bow down
before your god.

104
00:08:29,341 --> 00:08:30,874
Well that's that.

105
00:08:30,974 --> 00:08:33,508
I wonder what took him so long?

106
00:08:33,608 --> 00:08:36,274
Ah, he probably let
them choose again.

107
00:08:36,374 --> 00:08:41,841
How wasteful. No one
has ever choosen any
differently, so why delay?

108
00:08:41,974 --> 00:08:46,108
He may not look it, but
he's a very benevolent god.

109
00:08:47,174 --> 00:08:49,541
Hmm. How very true.

110
00:09:05,474 --> 00:09:08,908
[Goddess] So, it
has finally begun.

111
00:09:09,008 --> 00:09:13,008
[Jirousin] Merciful Goddess,
how can you be calm
after what they've done?

112
00:09:13,108 --> 00:09:14,508
[Goddess] What do you mean?

113
00:09:14,641 --> 00:09:17,441
Surely you aren't planning
to just sit here like this?

114
00:09:17,541 --> 00:09:22,208
There has to be something
that we can do. You must
inform the Jade Emperor!

115
00:09:22,308 --> 00:09:27,074
Jiroushin, inform the Jade
Emperor? Are you joking?

116
00:09:27,174 --> 00:09:28,941
What do you mean "joking?"

117
00:09:29,041 --> 00:09:34,308
[Goddess] Tell me, what makes
you think the Jade Emperor would
be opposed to any of this?

118
00:09:34,408 --> 00:09:38,941
The Heavenly Army's duty
is to keep the Lower World
from disrupting the heavens.

119
00:09:39,041 --> 00:09:42,774
That's exactly what they've
done, at least in appearance.

120
00:09:42,874 --> 00:09:48,474
No, I expect to see the Jade
Emperor very pleased to see
these demons subjugated,

121
00:09:48,574 --> 00:09:51,674
and he will order no
actions against them.

122
00:09:51,774 --> 00:09:54,574
Not to mention, the Prince
of War is his kin.

123
00:09:54,674 --> 00:09:59,074
Even if he does happen to be
half immortal and half human.

124
00:10:00,041 --> 00:10:01,274
Why yes, but...

125
00:10:01,374 --> 00:10:04,408
Children born of gods and
humans are still as taboo

126
00:10:04,508 --> 00:10:07,274
as demon half-breeds, remember?

127
00:10:07,374 --> 00:10:10,574
And so Homura has had to do
some of heaven's dirty work,

128
00:10:10,674 --> 00:10:15,874
just like Nataku was forced to
do. That role was given to them.

129
00:10:15,974 --> 00:10:21,608
And I suspect the Jade Emperor
will be as inclined as everyone
else to look the other way.

130
00:10:21,741 --> 00:10:24,208
But Goddess! Surely they
can see it is inevitable.

131
00:10:24,308 --> 00:10:27,341
These fiends will eventually
rise up against us!

132
00:10:27,441 --> 00:10:31,541
I fear peace has made
the gods complacent.

133
00:10:31,641 --> 00:10:35,174
They can't allow
themselves to see it.

134
00:10:35,274 --> 00:10:40,941
They've grown far too fat and
comfortable with how things are.

135
00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:46,108
So act then! If others won't,
then can't you can do something
to stop these renegades?

136
00:10:46,208 --> 00:10:52,708
You must be kidding. Why would
I want to stop anything that's
going to be this much fun?

137
00:10:52,808 --> 00:10:57,408
No I think I'll just
sit back and enjoy this.

138
00:10:57,508 --> 00:10:58,841
You're not serious?

139
00:11:00,341 --> 00:11:02,274
Well, I'll tell you one thing.

140
00:11:02,374 --> 00:11:04,341
I won't be bored for a while.

141
00:11:19,382 --> 00:11:22,543
[Goku] What? You're
completely booked?!

142
00:11:22,543 --> 00:11:26,343
I'm sorry. I'm afraid all
I have is a single room.

143
00:11:26,443 --> 00:11:27,976
[Sanzo] That's fine.
We'll take it.

144
00:11:28,076 --> 00:11:31,276
Take it? But we can't
all share one bed.

145
00:11:31,376 --> 00:11:33,343
That's why you're
camping outside.

146
00:11:33,443 --> 00:11:35,843
Why should you get it?! Huh?!

147
00:11:35,943 --> 00:11:38,776
It's simple. I paid
for the damn room.

148
00:11:38,876 --> 00:11:41,443
No, the three floating
heads paid for it.

149
00:11:41,543 --> 00:11:42,710
I have a gun.

150
00:11:43,876 --> 00:11:45,776
I know, I have an idea.

151
00:11:45,876 --> 00:11:48,343
How about I lay a bunch of
blankets out for you guys,

152
00:11:48,443 --> 00:11:50,376
and you could all
sleep together?

153
00:11:52,876 --> 00:11:54,210
[All] Sleep together?!

154
00:12:09,576 --> 00:12:11,276
You're leaving?

155
00:12:12,376 --> 00:12:14,810
Which way? Westward, I assume.

156
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:18,176
We are not ready to go east yet.

157
00:12:18,276 --> 00:12:20,076
So we...?

158
00:12:20,176 --> 00:12:23,776
Westward. We go
to Houtou Castle.

159
00:12:26,443 --> 00:12:27,943
Where we shall obtain...

160
00:12:29,443 --> 00:12:31,376
the Seiten Scripture.

161
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:36,710
This is not good.

162
00:12:36,810 --> 00:12:39,843
We only have one bed,
but there are four of us.

163
00:12:39,943 --> 00:12:43,576
Which means three of us will
be sleeping on the floor.

164
00:12:43,676 --> 00:12:45,943
Quite the conundrum.

165
00:12:46,043 --> 00:12:49,576
You better not be expecting
me to sleep down there.

166
00:12:49,676 --> 00:12:53,543
It's been five days since I've
slept in a real bed! It's mine!

167
00:12:53,643 --> 00:12:56,710
I don't like waking up
next to familiar faces.

168
00:12:56,810 --> 00:12:57,943
A wager, then?

169
00:12:58,843 --> 00:13:00,076
Okay.

170
00:13:00,176 --> 00:13:01,643
Get the cards.

171
00:13:03,443 --> 00:13:06,676
Okay. Let's just keep
this nice and simple.

172
00:13:06,776 --> 00:13:10,376
Whoever draws the highest card
will get to sleep in luxury.

173
00:13:12,810 --> 00:13:13,710
[Goku] Kick ass!

174
00:13:13,810 --> 00:13:14,943
[Hakkai] I'll take this one.

175
00:13:15,043 --> 00:13:16,610
[Hakuryu squeaks loudly]

176
00:13:16,710 --> 00:13:18,776
Huh? What's up with the parrot?

177
00:13:18,876 --> 00:13:21,810
Hakuryu says that he would
like to draw a card too.

178
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:25,776
Huh? But you're just a car! What
the hell do you want a bed for?

179
00:13:27,410 --> 00:13:30,810
Come on, it wouldn't be
nice to leave him out.

180
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:33,676
Augh, alright. Take
one, you stupid bird.

181
00:13:36,276 --> 00:13:40,943
Ha! In your face, buckos!
I got me a King!

182
00:13:41,043 --> 00:13:45,376
My gosh, you're right.
There's no way you
could ever beat a king.

183
00:13:45,476 --> 00:13:46,910
Unless you've got an ace.

184
00:13:47,010 --> 00:13:48,310
Ah, shit!

185
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:50,843
Especially if it's
an ace of spades.

186
00:13:51,843 --> 00:13:53,643
Will you look at that.

187
00:13:54,943 --> 00:13:56,610
Ah, dammit!

188
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:58,110
Pardon me.

189
00:14:00,210 --> 00:14:02,843
But we both drew
jokers. Good night.

190
00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:10,943
No way! I don't
care what you drew!

191
00:14:11,043 --> 00:14:13,410
[Goku] It's mine! Mine!
[Gojyo] Will you stop
acting like a child?

192
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:15,010
I AM a child, doofus!

193
00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:18,276
Oh, grow up! Get off!

194
00:14:18,410 --> 00:14:21,443
[Gojyo] Get off!
[Goku] I don't wanna, I
don't wanna, I don't wanna!

195
00:14:21,543 --> 00:14:22,410
[Gojyo] Wanna die?!

196
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:23,676
I'm starting to think getting

197
00:14:23,776 --> 00:14:26,543
the room was a bad
idea in the first place.

198
00:14:26,643 --> 00:14:29,610
How will any of us sleep
with all this noise?

199
00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:33,476
Hakuryu, colored joker beats
mine, so the bed is yours.

200
00:14:33,576 --> 00:14:34,476
[Hakuryu squeaks questioningly]

201
00:14:34,576 --> 00:14:36,410
Ow! Ow ow ow! Ow!

202
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:39,643
If you want up, say you're
sorry! Say you're sorry!

203
00:14:39,743 --> 00:14:41,310
[Goku] You're the one
who dealt those cards!

204
00:14:41,410 --> 00:14:42,843
[Lady] Everyone!
[Gojyo] Apologize!

205
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:45,376
[Lady] I've brought
you something to-
[Goku] You're heavy, Gojyo!

206
00:14:51,743 --> 00:14:54,543
[Lady] Oh, sorry. I'll just
leave this right here!

207
00:14:57,743 --> 00:15:00,410
I-I swear I didn't see
anything! Enjoy your stay!

208
00:15:03,076 --> 00:15:06,610
[Gojyo] Be honest with me
fellas. Does this look bad?

209
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:08,910
[Goku] Huh? What? Why?

210
00:15:09,010 --> 00:15:12,943
[Sanzo] Depends on how
you define "bad," but yes.

211
00:15:13,043 --> 00:15:17,376
[Hakkai] Nevermind, Goku.
Now please get off my
bed. I'm turning in.

212
00:15:17,476 --> 00:15:19,643
[Gojyo] I don't want her
getting the wrong idea about me!

213
00:15:19,743 --> 00:15:21,010
Maybe I should go after her.

214
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:22,076
[Goku snores]

215
00:15:22,176 --> 00:15:24,876
[Gojyo] HEY! That's my
spot, stupid monkey!

216
00:15:25,010 --> 00:15:28,543
[Gojyo] Move over!
You had the lowest card.
[Goku continues snoring]

217
00:15:28,643 --> 00:15:31,776
[Gojyo] I said wake up! Wake up!

218
00:15:31,876 --> 00:15:36,343
I had dibs! And will you
stop that infernal snoring?!

219
00:15:36,443 --> 00:15:37,010
[Single gunfire]

220
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:38,376
[Sanzo] Now shut up!

221
00:15:59,943 --> 00:16:05,243
[Homura] I'll say this for
it, Konzen. If nothing else,

222
00:16:05,343 --> 00:16:09,610
the lower world is
not predictable.

223
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:15,643
I don't blame you for
forgetting all about the
heavens once you were reborn.

224
00:16:15,743 --> 00:16:18,910
That place must have
bored you to death.

225
00:16:30,143 --> 00:16:33,943
[Konzen] I forget
who it was that said
monotony could kill a man.

226
00:16:34,043 --> 00:16:36,443
Someone from the
Lower World, I believe.

227
00:16:36,543 --> 00:16:39,076
But here, death
doesn't even exist.

228
00:16:39,176 --> 00:16:42,776
Your brain just melts away at
room temperature for eternity.

229
00:16:48,176 --> 00:16:51,410
[Goddess] Ah-hem. I can see
the boredom on your face.

230
00:16:54,643 --> 00:16:56,843
And what of it?

231
00:16:56,943 --> 00:17:00,010
[Goddess] I see the
tedium hasn't mellowed
your temperament any.

232
00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:03,776
Remember, you are addressing
the Merciful Goddess.

233
00:17:03,876 --> 00:17:06,343
You're not that merciful.

234
00:17:06,443 --> 00:17:08,543
And if you've come
to taunt me, don't.

235
00:17:08,643 --> 00:17:12,610
All those documents you
have to stamp without
even looking at them.

236
00:17:14,243 --> 00:17:16,943
Come with me. The Ascetic Egan,

237
00:17:17,043 --> 00:17:21,010
it seems he has brought a new
animal up from the Lower World.

238
00:17:21,110 --> 00:17:22,310
An animal, eh?

239
00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:25,676
[Goddess] Yes. And ferocious
too, for it's size.

240
00:17:25,776 --> 00:17:28,210
And it's got the
most golden eyes.

241
00:17:34,897 --> 00:17:37,458
[Egan] It has been too
long, oh Merciful Goddess.

242
00:17:37,458 --> 00:17:39,025
It is so kind of you to see me.

243
00:17:39,925 --> 00:17:41,458
Enough chitchat.

244
00:17:41,558 --> 00:17:44,525
I believe you said you had a
youngling from the Lower World?

245
00:17:44,625 --> 00:17:48,325
True. My lady, he's a monstrous,
heretical being born from a

246
00:17:48,425 --> 00:17:53,958
mystical rock at the heart of
Mount Kaka in the Hourai Kingdom
in the land of Toushoushin.

247
00:17:54,058 --> 00:17:56,158
That's quite a rough birth.

248
00:17:56,258 --> 00:17:59,291
So, he is neither
a demon nor a human.

249
00:17:59,391 --> 00:18:01,358
He is born of the earth.

250
00:18:01,458 --> 00:18:04,925
I must warn you. I believe
him to be very dangerous.

251
00:18:05,025 --> 00:18:06,158
[Goku] Let me go!

252
00:18:06,258 --> 00:18:08,358
You're hurting me!
This hurts my wrist!

253
00:18:10,758 --> 00:18:13,091
Quiet! Behave, you little beast!

254
00:18:15,625 --> 00:18:19,791
You said I'd get something
to eat! You damn liar!

255
00:18:19,891 --> 00:18:21,891
<i>[Konzen] He is an</i>
<i>animal, all right.</i>

256
00:18:21,991 --> 00:18:23,591
<i>Like a wild monkey.</i>

257
00:18:36,391 --> 00:18:40,825
[Homura] And so Son Goku and
Konzen Douji were united.

258
00:18:59,325 --> 00:19:01,825
The reformation of earth begins.

259
00:19:49,491 --> 00:19:50,891
So, my friend.

260
00:19:50,991 --> 00:19:53,825
What do you think of
your successor now?

261
00:19:53,925 --> 00:19:57,091
Is this what you would
have done, before you
became like that?

262
00:19:59,491 --> 00:20:04,358
He is a heretic just like
you, used by the heavens
to do their dirty work.

263
00:20:04,458 --> 00:20:10,691
Another "unclean being" exempted
from the divine laws against
the taking of human life.

264
00:20:10,791 --> 00:20:15,425
It always pained me to see
what they had done to you.

265
00:20:15,525 --> 00:20:18,658
But this war prince
is a sad case too.

266
00:20:18,758 --> 00:20:21,391
Another tool, used by the gods.

267
00:20:23,625 --> 00:20:26,925
Oh, yes. I feel for him, too.
