1
00:01:31,666 --> 00:01:35,500
[Homura taking deep breaths]

2
00:02:01,135 --> 00:02:02,435
[Gojyo] This must be the place.

3
00:02:03,268 --> 00:02:05,368
No doubt about it.

4
00:02:05,468 --> 00:02:07,235
So that's the Tower of Konran.

5
00:02:07,335 --> 00:02:09,568
So that's where I'll
find those gods, right?

6
00:02:12,502 --> 00:02:13,635
Let's go!

7
00:02:17,235 --> 00:02:18,735
So they're here.

8
00:02:25,602 --> 00:02:28,202
[Goku] "Showdown at
the Tower of Konran."

9
00:02:35,835 --> 00:02:39,202
[Shien] Destroying this world
to make way for a new one...

10
00:02:40,235 --> 00:02:43,102
That is why I am here.

11
00:02:43,202 --> 00:02:45,768
But still, I can't help but...

12
00:02:45,868 --> 00:02:49,368
wonder if the universe we
create will be any better.

13
00:02:49,468 --> 00:02:51,468
But it's useless
to second guess.

14
00:02:54,968 --> 00:02:57,868
<i>I made my choice</i>
<i>a long time ago...</i>

15
00:02:57,968 --> 00:03:01,435
<i>and there's no deviating</i>
<i>from this path once</i>
<i>I've set upon it.</i>

16
00:03:05,335 --> 00:03:08,968
<i>Yes, I chose to put all my</i>
<i>faith in Homura then...</i>

17
00:03:09,068 --> 00:03:13,635
<i>when I saw the horrible</i>
<i>things we'd done to you,</i>
<i>in the name of Heaven.</i>

18
00:03:16,202 --> 00:03:20,368
<i>Nataku... this life has</i>
<i>been so cruel to you.</i>

19
00:03:20,468 --> 00:03:24,968
<i>You are the only one who</i>
<i>could stop us, if you had</i>
<i>not locked your heart away.</i>

20
00:03:27,435 --> 00:03:29,902
<i>Once the weight of</i>
<i>the world is gone,</i>

21
00:03:30,002 --> 00:03:32,235
<i>then maybe you can</i>
<i>open it up again.</i>

22
00:03:33,535 --> 00:03:35,268
<i>We shall see.</i>

23
00:03:35,368 --> 00:03:38,668
<i>At least in the next world,</i>
<i>there is hope.</i>

24
00:04:02,868 --> 00:04:04,835
It is time.

25
00:04:04,935 --> 00:04:06,602
I'm ready for them.

26
00:04:11,902 --> 00:04:14,435
<i>Konzen Douji...</i>

27
00:04:14,568 --> 00:04:17,102
<i>Field Marshal Tenpou...</i>

28
00:04:17,202 --> 00:04:18,635
<i>General Kenren,</i>

29
00:04:18,735 --> 00:04:19,902
<i>and Son Goku.</i>

30
00:04:20,968 --> 00:04:23,968
<i>Have you not suffered</i>
<i>as we have?</i>

31
00:04:24,068 --> 00:04:27,602
<i>Are your hearts not also</i>
<i>filled with sorrow?</i>

32
00:04:27,702 --> 00:04:30,702
<i>Then, why do you oppose us?</i>

33
00:04:30,802 --> 00:04:34,168
<i>Can't you see that the only way</i>
<i>to get rid of the pain...</i>

34
00:04:34,268 --> 00:04:36,468
<i>is by destroying everything?</i>

35
00:04:41,535 --> 00:04:43,002
Break through the door, Hakkai!

36
00:04:43,102 --> 00:04:45,468
I'm one step ahead of you,
Sanzo!

37
00:04:45,568 --> 00:04:46,702
[Goku] Do it!

38
00:04:47,702 --> 00:04:49,702
I'll say... one thing for ya!

39
00:04:50,635 --> 00:04:52,668
You'll... make a big entrance!

40
00:04:53,302 --> 00:04:55,335
You got that... right!

41
00:04:56,435 --> 00:04:57,568
[Hakuryu squeaks]

42
00:05:13,235 --> 00:05:14,835
[Hakkai] Funny.

43
00:05:14,935 --> 00:05:18,102
I was expecting more
of a welcome than this.

44
00:05:18,202 --> 00:05:20,168
[Gojyo] Not very good
hosts, are they?

45
00:05:20,302 --> 00:05:24,802
It doesn't matter... whether
it is a trap or it isn't...

46
00:05:24,902 --> 00:05:26,702
We have to get moving.

47
00:05:26,802 --> 00:05:28,135
Got that right!

48
00:05:32,268 --> 00:05:33,302
[Sanzo] Here they come now.

49
00:05:33,402 --> 00:05:35,202
[Goku] I don't sense
Homura or the others.

50
00:05:35,302 --> 00:05:36,435
Are you sure?

51
00:05:37,535 --> 00:05:41,268
[Male voice] So good of
you to come, Genjo Sanzo.

52
00:05:41,368 --> 00:05:44,068
I don't believe we've ever met.

53
00:05:45,435 --> 00:05:49,502
[Male voice] I'm Gairu,
leader of the Holy Demon Army.

54
00:05:49,602 --> 00:05:52,968
By Lord Homura's will,
I shall give you death.

55
00:05:53,068 --> 00:05:57,902
No thank you. The only presents
I accept are from the ladies.

56
00:05:58,002 --> 00:05:59,535
But I insist.

57
00:06:05,268 --> 00:06:07,702
Believe me, it will
be no trouble at all.

58
00:06:07,802 --> 00:06:11,302
I'm sick and tired of your
delusions of grandeur!

59
00:06:11,402 --> 00:06:15,002
Why don't you try us again in
about ten billion years or so?

60
00:06:15,102 --> 00:06:19,668
And, for your information,
I can be a giving
person as well!

61
00:06:19,768 --> 00:06:23,235
[Sanzo] Stop wasting our time.
Our business is with Homura.

62
00:06:23,335 --> 00:06:24,602
Step aside!

63
00:06:24,702 --> 00:06:26,768
[Gairu] What if I don't want to?

64
00:06:28,168 --> 00:06:29,935
[Sanzo] Then you die.

65
00:06:30,035 --> 00:06:31,068
Get them!

66
00:06:31,168 --> 00:06:32,302
[Demons growling and snarling]

67
00:06:52,635 --> 00:06:54,468
It can't be!

68
00:07:03,368 --> 00:07:06,868
It looks like I'm
running out... of time.

69
00:07:09,902 --> 00:07:12,435
[Zenon] You look worried.
Is something wrong?

70
00:07:12,535 --> 00:07:13,835
[Homura] No.

71
00:07:30,902 --> 00:07:33,968
[Homura] They are curious
though, aren't they?

72
00:07:34,102 --> 00:07:37,868
At first glance, they appear to
have nothing at all in common.

73
00:07:37,968 --> 00:07:40,635
Yet they work together
in perfect harmony,

74
00:07:40,735 --> 00:07:43,502
each one's strength making
up for the other's weakness.

75
00:07:43,602 --> 00:07:47,702
Genjo Sanzo...

76
00:07:47,802 --> 00:07:49,435
[Shien] Cho Hakkai...

77
00:07:51,568 --> 00:07:53,435
[Zenon] Sha Gojyo...

78
00:07:54,402 --> 00:07:56,602
[Homura] And...

79
00:07:56,702 --> 00:07:58,168
Son Goku.

80
00:07:59,635 --> 00:08:03,802
A creature born from
a rock on Mount Kaka.

81
00:08:03,902 --> 00:08:07,435
Your individuality
makes you invincible.

82
00:08:07,568 --> 00:08:12,468
A heretic with golden
eyes. He is the secret.

83
00:08:12,568 --> 00:08:15,768
Son Goku must be captured.

84
00:08:15,868 --> 00:08:17,302
[Shien gives a short chuckle]

85
00:08:17,402 --> 00:08:21,468
This is exactly what we've been
preparing for all this time.

86
00:08:21,568 --> 00:08:26,468
So, you need the monkey
to create a new Heaven
and Earth, is that it?

87
00:08:28,202 --> 00:08:30,802
Well, you get the prize.

88
00:08:30,902 --> 00:08:36,135
[Shien] The Holy Army is
reporting that Sanzo and party
have already breached the tower.

89
00:08:36,235 --> 00:08:40,102
[Zenon] I have a feeling Goku
won't need any help finding us.

90
00:08:40,202 --> 00:08:44,602
But, it won't do us any good if
he gets killed, now will it?

91
00:08:44,702 --> 00:08:49,102
He's not much good to
us if he can't even get
this far, now is he?

92
00:08:49,202 --> 00:08:52,002
Don't you worry. He'll be here.

93
00:08:55,035 --> 00:08:56,502
I have no doubt.

94
00:08:59,435 --> 00:09:01,602
<i>[Homura] I have no doubt.</i>

95
00:09:01,702 --> 00:09:07,035
<i>Son Goku, the only being</i>
<i>capable of seeing the</i>
<i>ephemerality of life.</i>

96
00:09:07,135 --> 00:09:10,602
<i>I will possess you...</i>
<i>no matter what.</i>

97
00:09:17,268 --> 00:09:18,402
[Demon yells]

98
00:09:20,135 --> 00:09:24,802
Heh. Somehow I was expecting
a little more from
Homura's minions.

99
00:09:24,902 --> 00:09:29,168
No joke. Taking these guys
out was almost too easy.

100
00:09:29,268 --> 00:09:32,502
Well then, it looks to me
like we're all done here.

101
00:09:33,368 --> 00:09:35,002
[Sanzo] I guess...

102
00:09:35,102 --> 00:09:37,035
that leaves you.

103
00:09:37,135 --> 00:09:39,202
[Gairu] Oh, I beg to differ.

104
00:09:39,302 --> 00:09:40,435
What?!

105
00:09:42,468 --> 00:09:45,768
[Demons growling]

106
00:09:54,702 --> 00:09:56,802
No way! They're dead!

107
00:09:56,902 --> 00:09:59,368
Okay, I never expected this.

108
00:09:59,468 --> 00:10:01,302
That's why they're so weak.

109
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:10,835
The benevolent Homura has
granted us, eternal life
and the very power of the gods!

110
00:10:10,935 --> 00:10:14,035
I do hope you're not in a hurry.
This could take a while,

111
00:10:14,135 --> 00:10:16,168
and we've got all
the time in the world!

112
00:10:16,268 --> 00:10:18,468
[Gairu laughs triumphantly]

113
00:10:18,568 --> 00:10:21,168
I never was the
very patient type.

114
00:10:21,302 --> 00:10:23,635
[Hakkai] This could turn
out to be rather tedious.

115
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:37,410
[Homura] Behold, gentlemen.

116
00:10:39,544 --> 00:10:45,210
The pentagram... with the power
to create Heaven and Earth.

117
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:49,377
The Maten Scripture occupies
this point of the star.

118
00:10:49,477 --> 00:10:52,844
The Seiten Scripture occupies
the other.

119
00:10:52,944 --> 00:10:56,277
As we take the place of the
three remaining scriptures,

120
00:10:56,377 --> 00:10:59,777
the five points of
the star are completed.

121
00:11:09,144 --> 00:11:11,177
[Shien] What incredible power.

122
00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:14,677
Just look at it...

123
00:11:14,777 --> 00:11:21,144
All that power resonating from
the five corner points is
collecting in the middle.

124
00:11:21,244 --> 00:11:24,477
But it's not only
our powers collecting.

125
00:11:24,577 --> 00:11:29,110
It feels like all the spiritual
power of the entire world...

126
00:11:29,210 --> 00:11:32,510
is being transmitted through
us towards the center.

127
00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:34,544
[Zenon] It's amazing, isn't it?

128
00:11:34,644 --> 00:11:37,310
All we've done is
stand in our places.

129
00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:39,544
[Shien] I can't
say I'm surprised.

130
00:11:39,644 --> 00:11:45,410
We are talking about harnessing
enough energy to recreate the
universe, after all.

131
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:49,044
[Homura] But I'm afraid
it's still incomplete.

132
00:11:49,144 --> 00:11:52,910
Only by placing Son Goku in
the center of the pentagram,

133
00:11:53,010 --> 00:12:00,277
will we be able to conjure up
the power necessary to replace
Shangri-La with a new world.

134
00:12:00,377 --> 00:12:01,744
He is the key.

135
00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:05,510
<i>[Homura] Hurry, Son Goku.</i>

136
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:07,810
<i>Come to claim...</i>

137
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:09,410
<i>your destiny!</i>

138
00:12:09,944 --> 00:12:11,077
[Gods panicking]

139
00:12:14,277 --> 00:12:20,177
Reporting in! We are reading
an enormous power surge from
the Tower of Konran, my lord!

140
00:12:20,277 --> 00:12:23,510
This smells like Homura's
deceitful treachery to me, sire.

141
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:26,110
His blasphemous scheme is
on a scale that could restart

142
00:12:26,210 --> 00:12:28,977
creation, and form
a new Heaven and Earth.

143
00:12:29,077 --> 00:12:32,710
But why?! Tell me why this fact
was not reported to me earlier!

144
00:12:33,577 --> 00:12:34,744
An emergency summons!

145
00:12:34,844 --> 00:12:37,244
Gather all the members of
the high council at once!

146
00:12:40,144 --> 00:12:44,144
[Goddess] They're panicking
right on schedule. Heh.

147
00:12:44,244 --> 00:12:46,710
That sure takes some of
the excitement out of it.

148
00:12:49,577 --> 00:12:51,444
Merciful Goddess,
what are you doing here?!

149
00:12:51,544 --> 00:12:54,444
Don't you know what's
happening down there?!

150
00:12:54,544 --> 00:12:56,944
Isn't it obvious?

151
00:12:57,044 --> 00:13:01,244
I just want to see...
what life brings their way.

152
00:13:01,344 --> 00:13:02,844
[Jiroushin] What kind
of nonsense is that?

153
00:13:02,944 --> 00:13:04,610
Can't you see how
serious this is?

154
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:07,444
We're talking about the complete
destruction of Heaven!

155
00:13:07,544 --> 00:13:09,310
But of course.

156
00:13:09,410 --> 00:13:12,310
Let me remind you, Jiroushin,
that of all the gods,

157
00:13:12,410 --> 00:13:15,577
only I could see this coming
from a mile away.

158
00:13:15,677 --> 00:13:17,877
And it doesn't BOTHER you?

159
00:13:17,977 --> 00:13:21,844
This by-the-number script
was written for us long ago.

160
00:13:21,944 --> 00:13:24,244
Why should I complain
about my part in it now?

161
00:13:24,344 --> 00:13:26,477
That won't accomplish anything.

162
00:13:26,577 --> 00:13:28,910
But... u-uh...

163
00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:32,010
[Goddess] It was inevitable.
How foolish of us to think men

164
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:35,010
like that could waste away
in this prison forever.

165
00:13:36,877 --> 00:13:38,310
[Goddess sighs]

166
00:13:38,410 --> 00:13:41,010
I am just so envious.

167
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:43,177
Um, please forgive me...

168
00:13:43,277 --> 00:13:45,077
Yes, I know.

169
00:13:45,177 --> 00:13:46,644
They've called a meeting, right?

170
00:13:46,744 --> 00:13:47,977
[Messenger God] Ah, yes.

171
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:51,310
[Goddess] Let's go, Jiroushin.
It's time to watch some gods

172
00:13:51,410 --> 00:13:55,577
bicker endlessly as their
kingdom crumbles beneath them.

173
00:13:55,677 --> 00:13:59,010
The things you say!
What am I going to do with you?!

174
00:14:00,577 --> 00:14:02,910
<i>[Goddess] I will</i>
<i>do my part, Konzen.</i>

175
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:05,510
<i>You just do what you do best.</i>

176
00:14:05,610 --> 00:14:08,177
<i>Handle things in your own way.</i>

177
00:14:08,277 --> 00:14:09,410
[Demons yelling]

178
00:14:10,610 --> 00:14:12,644
Hey, you say something?

179
00:14:12,744 --> 00:14:14,410
No, nothing.

180
00:14:14,510 --> 00:14:16,477
You'd better rest up, monk.

181
00:14:16,577 --> 00:14:19,144
All this demon shooting
must be starting to really

182
00:14:19,244 --> 00:14:22,310
affect your hearing.
You hear what I'm saying?

183
00:14:22,410 --> 00:14:23,577
I'll shoot you.

184
00:14:27,477 --> 00:14:30,444
You asshole! You could
have accidentally shot me!

185
00:14:30,544 --> 00:14:33,910
Did you say something to me?
I must be hearing things.

186
00:14:34,010 --> 00:14:38,510
CAN YA HEAR ME NOW, ya blonde,
himbo, wannabe bastard!

187
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:41,677
[Demons growling]
[Sanzo] What did you call me?

188
00:14:41,777 --> 00:14:44,744
Gentlemen, gentlemen.
The demons?

189
00:14:47,010 --> 00:14:48,977
Make me do all of the work!

190
00:14:49,077 --> 00:14:52,544
What are we going
to do about them?!

191
00:14:52,644 --> 00:14:56,044
Our usual methods don't seem
to be effective this time.

192
00:14:58,210 --> 00:15:01,844
[Sanzo] We could chop them
up until they can't be
resurrected again.

193
00:15:01,944 --> 00:15:05,544
[Hakkai] Or find a way to
vaporize them into molecules.

194
00:15:05,644 --> 00:15:08,977
That's one way we could
buy us a little time.

195
00:15:09,077 --> 00:15:10,677
That Homura...

196
00:15:12,544 --> 00:15:15,044
sure is a cunning
bastard, all right!

197
00:15:18,644 --> 00:15:20,910
<i>[Homura] Just look</i>
<i>at it, Rinrei.</i>

198
00:15:22,044 --> 00:15:23,877
<i>It's what we always wanted.</i>

199
00:15:27,610 --> 00:15:29,910
<i>A place where we</i>
<i>can truly be free.</i>

200
00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:34,377
<i>Out here, there is</i>
<i>no heresy or taboos.</i>

201
00:15:37,010 --> 00:15:41,444
<i>And a love as pure as ours...</i>
<i>would never be forbidden.</i>

202
00:15:43,544 --> 00:15:44,910
Let us begin.

203
00:16:05,344 --> 00:16:06,444
What is that?!

204
00:16:06,544 --> 00:16:10,444
Look up there! <i>Even from</i>
<i>all the way down here,</i>

205
00:16:10,544 --> 00:16:13,077
<i>I can sense an</i>
<i>enormous flow of chi.</i>

206
00:16:13,177 --> 00:16:16,044
<i>Just what in the hell</i>
<i>are those guys up to?</i>

207
00:16:16,144 --> 00:16:18,510
[Demons yell]

208
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:23,577
[Sanzo] I guess they weren't
joking when they said they
wanted to wreck the Heavens.

209
00:16:23,677 --> 00:16:25,877
You're right. This isn't funny.

210
00:16:25,977 --> 00:16:29,310
Looks to me like we better
kick things up a notch.

211
00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:30,077
Right.

212
00:16:30,177 --> 00:16:31,544
Pay attention!

213
00:16:31,677 --> 00:16:33,710
We are coming for you!

214
00:16:33,810 --> 00:16:34,677
[Demons growling]

215
00:16:34,777 --> 00:16:36,244
[Both] Will you shut up?!

216
00:16:44,377 --> 00:16:46,710
Why won't these guys ever learn?

217
00:16:46,810 --> 00:16:49,177
It's going to hurt every
time we kill 'em.

218
00:16:49,277 --> 00:16:52,110
It's like we're caught
in an endless loop, man!

219
00:16:52,210 --> 00:16:54,244
Boy, you're a quick one.

220
00:16:54,344 --> 00:16:57,477
Sanzo, I believe I may
have a way out of this.

221
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:02,444
I just need you to head
upstairs for a moment.

222
00:17:02,544 --> 00:17:04,177
It shouldn't take too long.

223
00:17:04,277 --> 00:17:05,677
[Both] Huh?!

224
00:17:05,777 --> 00:17:08,410
Why didn't I think of that?

225
00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:11,510
[Hakkai] You like it?
I came up with it myself.

226
00:17:12,877 --> 00:17:15,644
[Sanzo] Are you
absolutely serious?

227
00:17:15,744 --> 00:17:18,810
[Hakkai] I wasn't entirely
joking about it, no.

228
00:17:18,910 --> 00:17:21,477
[Sanzo] Hakkai, you
aren't planning to...

229
00:17:25,644 --> 00:17:27,177
Please, there's no time.

230
00:17:27,277 --> 00:17:30,710
I know what I'm doing, Sanzo.
You just go on without me.

231
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:35,010
[Sanzo] I suppose there's
no talking you out of it.

232
00:17:36,477 --> 00:17:39,677
Got that? You come with me.

233
00:17:39,777 --> 00:17:42,277
We aren't going to just
leave him here, are we?

234
00:17:42,377 --> 00:17:45,944
You nuts? What makes you
think you can do it alone?

235
00:17:46,044 --> 00:17:47,444
Don't you worry.

236
00:17:47,544 --> 00:17:50,410
I'll be more than enough
for them. Promise.

237
00:17:51,910 --> 00:17:54,077
You're not actually going to...

238
00:17:54,177 --> 00:17:59,344
Gojyo, Goku, trust
me on this, okay?

239
00:17:59,444 --> 00:18:02,677
[Sanzo] Move out.
[Goku] Wait a minute!
Sanzo, you can't!

240
00:18:02,777 --> 00:18:05,910
[Gojyo] Aaah, hell.
We'll do it your way this once.

241
00:18:06,010 --> 00:18:09,744
[Hakkai chuckles]
Thanks. Oh, Gojyo!

242
00:18:09,844 --> 00:18:12,744
Could you take care
of Hakuryu for me?

243
00:18:12,844 --> 00:18:15,677
<i>[Hakkai] I couldn't forgive</i>
<i>myself if he got hurt in here.</i>

244
00:18:17,944 --> 00:18:18,844
Don't die.

245
00:18:18,944 --> 00:18:20,777
I don't plan to, believe me.

246
00:18:20,877 --> 00:18:21,877
You can't leave!

247
00:18:21,977 --> 00:18:24,610
Looks like I'm your
only opponent left.

248
00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:28,644
If you want to stop them, you'll
have to get through me first.

249
00:18:36,817 --> 00:18:38,677
[Goku] Maybe we should
go back and check on him.

250
00:18:38,677 --> 00:18:39,977
[Sanzo] Will you be quiet?

251
00:18:40,077 --> 00:18:41,877
[Goku] But Sanzo! He-

252
00:18:41,977 --> 00:18:43,477
[Gojyo] There it is.

253
00:18:43,577 --> 00:18:45,644
[Sanzo] After you.
[Goku] Hold it!

254
00:18:45,744 --> 00:18:47,011
What's your problem?

255
00:18:47,111 --> 00:18:48,311
I can't believe that...

256
00:18:48,444 --> 00:18:51,477
that you would just go and
leave Hakkai behind like that!

257
00:18:51,577 --> 00:18:54,011
None of us forced
him to stay behind.

258
00:18:54,111 --> 00:18:55,477
That's not the point!

259
00:18:55,577 --> 00:18:56,911
I've had enough!

260
00:18:58,244 --> 00:19:02,011
Weren't you listening? Did you
not hear one word Hakkai said?

261
00:19:03,511 --> 00:19:08,577
Gojyo, Goku, trust
me on this one, okay?

262
00:19:10,111 --> 00:19:12,311
[Gojyo] Cheer up, Goku.

263
00:19:12,411 --> 00:19:14,777
Hakkai did say that he...

264
00:19:14,877 --> 00:19:17,377
didn't plan to die, yanno.

265
00:19:17,477 --> 00:19:18,611
Leave him.

266
00:19:19,211 --> 00:19:20,811
Hakkai...

267
00:19:24,944 --> 00:19:26,577
[Demons growling and snarling]

268
00:19:28,577 --> 00:19:32,977
<i>[Hakkai] I don't normally</i>
<i>like to be this pushy, but...</i>

269
00:19:33,077 --> 00:19:35,577
[Gairu] Have you
lost your senses?

270
00:19:35,677 --> 00:19:37,744
The four of you
couldn't handle us.

271
00:19:37,844 --> 00:19:40,877
So what makes you think you
can do it any better alone?

272
00:19:42,911 --> 00:19:45,511
You'll find out soon enough.

273
00:19:45,611 --> 00:19:47,344
Of course...

274
00:19:47,444 --> 00:19:50,377
By that time, it'll be
too late to beg for mercy.

275
00:19:51,077 --> 00:19:53,277
Beg for mercy?

276
00:19:53,377 --> 00:19:56,911
I think you may have things
backward, my friend.

277
00:19:57,011 --> 00:20:00,777
Take one more step,
and you will die.

278
00:20:01,977 --> 00:20:03,344
Well then...

279
00:20:05,411 --> 00:20:06,777
Shall we get started?

280
00:20:08,011 --> 00:20:09,244
Kill him!

281
00:20:09,344 --> 00:20:12,311
[Demons yell and growl]

282
00:20:33,877 --> 00:20:35,011
[Hakkai yells]

283
00:20:39,744 --> 00:20:40,877
[Hakkai grunts in pain]

284
00:20:41,377 --> 00:20:45,044
[Pained yelling]
