1
00:01:42,655 --> 00:01:44,315
[Sanzo Narrating] On our
journey West,

2
00:01:44,315 --> 00:01:48,781
we come apon a fortune-teller,
Chin Yisou...

3
00:01:48,881 --> 00:01:53,715
Who gives us a grim warning and
points an accusing finger
at Hakkai.

4
00:01:57,581 --> 00:02:01,381
Then the strange fortune
teller vanishes,

5
00:02:01,481 --> 00:02:04,048
and we are attacked by
a Shikigami,

6
00:02:04,148 --> 00:02:08,315
a giant crab-like creature from
the depths of hell.

7
00:02:08,415 --> 00:02:11,081
Was this one of
Kougaiji's assassins?

8
00:02:14,081 --> 00:02:20,915
Then Kougaiji's little sister
suddenly arrives and it is her
who finally defeats the beast.

9
00:02:21,015 --> 00:02:22,848
Much to our surprise.

10
00:02:25,715 --> 00:02:29,848
When Kougaiji's band appears to
reclaim the little tyke,

11
00:02:29,948 --> 00:02:32,181
that's when the real
brawl begins.

12
00:02:42,315 --> 00:02:43,448
[Goku] "Fight Party"

13
00:03:03,648 --> 00:03:07,981
<i>That little bastard's</i>
<i>definitely gotten stronger</i>
<i>since last time.</i>

14
00:03:08,081 --> 00:03:09,848
<i>[Koukaji] How?</i>
[Goku] Hey!

15
00:03:09,948 --> 00:03:12,715
Don't tell me that's the best
you can do there, wood elf.

16
00:03:12,815 --> 00:03:13,948
Come on!

17
00:03:14,381 --> 00:03:16,015
Alright!

18
00:03:19,515 --> 00:03:20,515
Shit!

19
00:03:20,615 --> 00:03:23,081
[Goku] Next time put some effor
into it.

20
00:03:36,015 --> 00:03:37,515
[Goku] What do you think
you're doing?!

21
00:03:38,248 --> 00:03:39,781
At least fight back!

22
00:03:48,015 --> 00:03:50,481
<i>Why can't I defend myself?</i>

23
00:03:50,581 --> 00:03:52,381
No more playing around!

24
00:04:00,081 --> 00:04:02,315
<i>Who's playing around?</i>

25
00:04:02,415 --> 00:04:07,015
<i>You're just on some aimless</i>
<i>journey. What do you have</i>
<i>to lose?</i>

26
00:04:08,048 --> 00:04:10,448
<i>I have everything on the line.</i>

27
00:04:10,548 --> 00:04:11,748
<i>I coulde lose...</i>

28
00:04:16,715 --> 00:04:17,881
<i>My Mother...</i>

29
00:04:31,481 --> 00:04:32,648
<i>Oh mother...</i>

30
00:04:38,948 --> 00:04:40,881
<i>I would do anything for you.</i>

31
00:04:50,481 --> 00:04:51,615
Anything.

32
00:04:54,581 --> 00:04:55,815
<i>Damn you!</i>

33
00:05:00,215 --> 00:05:04,581
<i>This is one battle I can't</i>
<i>afford to lose!</i>

34
00:05:06,481 --> 00:05:08,348
No matter who I'm fighting!

35
00:05:08,448 --> 00:05:11,048
This one's for my mother!

36
00:05:18,048 --> 00:05:19,715
<i>That bastard's...</i>

37
00:05:22,315 --> 00:05:23,515
<i>...smiling!</i>

38
00:05:27,981 --> 00:05:28,615
Goku!

39
00:05:28,715 --> 00:05:29,448
That's one down.

40
00:05:29,548 --> 00:05:30,681
Holy shit!

41
00:05:53,148 --> 00:05:54,281
What?!

42
00:06:01,115 --> 00:06:04,181
So you can still land a punch!

43
00:06:05,315 --> 00:06:07,781
Can you still take one?

44
00:06:12,915 --> 00:06:14,681
That wasn't half bad.

45
00:06:14,781 --> 00:06:17,681
[Sanzo] Here, take another one.
I'm got plenty.

46
00:06:17,781 --> 00:06:18,915
Thanks!

47
00:06:31,715 --> 00:06:34,848
Go back. This is not your
battle, little man.

48
00:06:37,248 --> 00:06:38,515
<i>What's with him?</i>

49
00:06:42,948 --> 00:06:46,548
This is all nothing more than a
game to you. Is that it?

50
00:06:48,081 --> 00:06:50,915
<i>How has he become so strong?!</i>

51
00:06:51,015 --> 00:06:55,581
Why do you keep fighting if
you have nothing at stake
here?! Why?!

52
00:06:55,681 --> 00:06:59,348
[Goku] God, dude, what do you
keep talking about?

53
00:07:00,048 --> 00:07:03,215
I fight for myself! Me!

54
00:07:05,381 --> 00:07:07,048
That's reason enough.

55
00:07:08,415 --> 00:07:09,848
To take you down.

56
00:07:09,948 --> 00:07:11,081
Eat dirt!

57
00:07:12,515 --> 00:07:15,248
<i>[Kougaiji] Oh, I see.</i>

58
00:07:16,148 --> 00:07:19,281
<i>That's the source of</i>
<i>your strength.</i>

59
00:07:19,381 --> 00:07:24,015
<i>How strange. Could it really be</i>
<i>as simple as that?</i>

60
00:07:27,148 --> 00:07:28,215
Lord Kougaiji!

61
00:07:28,315 --> 00:07:29,881
My lord, are you alright?!

62
00:07:31,781 --> 00:07:36,048
<i>When I fought you that first</i>
<i>time, friend,</i>

63
00:07:36,148 --> 00:07:40,981
<i>I realized you possesed</i>
<i>something I didn't have.</i>

64
00:07:41,081 --> 00:07:46,148
<i>Freedom... Confidence...</i>
<i>Independence.</i>

65
00:07:46,248 --> 00:07:48,881
<i>That's what makes you strong.</i>

66
00:07:48,981 --> 00:07:52,048
<i>With those things,</i>
<i>anyone becomes...</i>

67
00:07:52,148 --> 00:07:53,315
<i>...invincible.</i>

68
00:07:55,648 --> 00:07:59,581
<i>[Internal laughter]</i>

69
00:07:59,681 --> 00:08:01,181
Get up, Kougaiji!

70
00:08:01,281 --> 00:08:04,015
Don't worry, Yaone, I'll take
care of him!

71
00:08:04,115 --> 00:08:05,248
[Kougaiji] No!

72
00:08:06,248 --> 00:08:09,581
This one is my opponent and
mine alone.

73
00:08:09,681 --> 00:08:14,181
And I always make sure to give
as good as I've gotten!

74
00:08:14,281 --> 00:08:17,315
That's great! Becuase I don't
like giving something up

75
00:08:17,415 --> 00:08:19,881
unless I can be sure to get
something in return.

76
00:08:19,981 --> 00:08:23,548
[Kougaiji] Just don't come
crying to me if you don't
like your present!

77
00:08:23,648 --> 00:08:25,681
[Goku] I can always give
it back!

78
00:08:26,815 --> 00:08:28,348
[Chin] My, my.

79
00:08:28,448 --> 00:08:32,048
They seem to be having so
much fun.

80
00:08:32,148 --> 00:08:35,548
But our little party hasn't
gotten going yet.

81
00:08:35,648 --> 00:08:40,348
Why don't I liven things up
a bit?

82
00:08:40,448 --> 00:08:45,948
To whom should I lend a
helping hand? Hakkai?

83
00:08:46,048 --> 00:08:48,915
Yes, to you Cho Gonou!

84
00:08:51,748 --> 00:08:55,081
[Chin] I'm sending this out to
you, Cho Gonou!

85
00:08:59,048 --> 00:09:01,648
With all my love.

86
00:09:13,148 --> 00:09:14,481
Goku...

87
00:09:14,581 --> 00:09:15,481
Watch your back!

88
00:09:15,581 --> 00:09:16,415
What?!

89
00:09:16,515 --> 00:09:17,648
What the?

90
00:09:25,948 --> 00:09:29,448
[Chin] Looks like the party has
just gotten started.

91
00:09:30,581 --> 00:09:40,748
[Chin laughs evily]

92
00:09:58,503 --> 00:10:00,083
Goku...

93
00:10:00,083 --> 00:10:00,850
Watch your back!

94
00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:01,850
What?!

95
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:03,083
What the?

96
00:10:12,183 --> 00:10:13,550
[Both] Holy shit!

97
00:10:17,017 --> 00:10:19,050
[Hakkai] Goku!
[Yaone] Lord Kougaiji!

98
00:10:35,383 --> 00:10:36,517
[Goku] Gojyo!

99
00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:44,183
Are you hurt? Yaone, are
you alright?

100
00:10:44,283 --> 00:10:45,417
Yes...

101
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:48,150
[Goku] You can't hold
it forever!

102
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:50,683
[Gojyo] Just get out of here!

103
00:10:50,783 --> 00:10:52,683
I can't! I won't leave
you behind.

104
00:10:52,783 --> 00:10:54,317
I said go, goddamnit!

105
00:10:54,417 --> 00:10:58,350
I told you I don't think I
can hold this thing back
much longer!

106
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:06,083
Thanks, I guess I owe you
one, Bro.

107
00:11:06,183 --> 00:11:09,050
But there's no need to thank me.

108
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:13,550
[Gojyo] Yeah
[Doku] It's no fun fighting you
with all these outside demonic
distractions.

109
00:11:13,650 --> 00:11:15,350
This is just a truce, man.

110
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:19,917
Oh what's the big deal?

111
00:11:20,017 --> 00:11:23,050
I kicked this guys ass with
no problem.

112
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:24,350
Listen.

113
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:25,783
Okay.

114
00:11:25,883 --> 00:11:28,283
What do you think
you're doing?

115
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:29,950
I'm sitting.

116
00:11:30,050 --> 00:11:31,383
Get off.

117
00:11:31,517 --> 00:11:33,483
Weenie!

118
00:11:33,583 --> 00:11:35,817
Oh boy are you gonna get it.

119
00:11:35,917 --> 00:11:39,017
A shikigami, and such a
fine specimen.

120
00:11:39,117 --> 00:11:43,083
[Hakkai] Wait a minute. So you
weren't the ones who summoned
it, to destroy us?

121
00:11:46,783 --> 00:11:48,250
<i>Then who did?</i>

122
00:11:49,217 --> 00:11:51,817
<i>Not that fortune-teller?</i>

123
00:11:51,917 --> 00:11:56,617
I did sense something icy,
something bloodthirsty
about him.

124
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:00,417
[Hakkai] Gojyo!

125
00:12:00,517 --> 00:12:02,217
[Gojyo] Well that didn't work.

126
00:12:03,783 --> 00:12:07,750
[Sanzo] Damn, cutting off a leg
or two doesn't appear to
do anything.

127
00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:12,083
The only way to kill that thing
is to disintigrate it.

128
00:12:12,183 --> 00:12:13,883
[Kougaiji] Leave that to me.

129
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:15,983
[Sanzo] You can't fight that
thing alone.

130
00:12:16,083 --> 00:12:17,750
Just watch and learn!

131
00:12:20,017 --> 00:12:21,550
Somebody help me!

132
00:12:21,650 --> 00:12:22,883
[Yaone screams]

133
00:12:22,983 --> 00:12:24,817
Yaone!

134
00:12:24,917 --> 00:12:27,017
Can you hear me?

135
00:12:27,117 --> 00:12:28,250
[Hakkai] Yaone!

136
00:12:32,783 --> 00:12:34,183
[Kougaiji] Oh no.

137
00:12:34,283 --> 00:12:36,583
Hakkai, you take care of her.

138
00:12:47,450 --> 00:12:48,583
[Kougaiji] Alright.

139
00:12:48,683 --> 00:12:49,983
Alright what?

140
00:12:50,083 --> 00:12:52,917
Is there any way you can keep
that thing from going anywhere?

141
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:56,317
[Kougaiji] If you can buy me
some time,

142
00:12:56,417 --> 00:12:59,650
I might be able to summon a
beast from the demon plane.

143
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:03,217
Then we just might be able to
put a stop to that thing.

144
00:13:04,483 --> 00:13:05,750
[Goku] Okay! You got it!

145
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:06,983
[Kougaiji] Monkey!

146
00:13:11,517 --> 00:13:14,283
I will only fight for my
own sake!

147
00:13:14,383 --> 00:13:16,217
No one will get in my way!

148
00:13:17,417 --> 00:13:20,650
Heheh! I wouldn't have it any
other way, hairdo.

149
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:23,417
I only need that thing
stationary for a moment!

150
00:13:23,517 --> 00:13:25,183
So don't screw it up!

151
00:13:25,283 --> 00:13:28,150
You must hold the beast in
one place.

152
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:31,517
I'll do my job, you do yours.

153
00:13:34,117 --> 00:13:37,983
Oh yeah, be sure and stay clear
of the blast.

154
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:41,950
Right! And you be sure not
miss the thing, okay?

155
00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:44,350
Will you just get on with
it, monkey!

156
00:13:44,483 --> 00:13:46,217
Oh alright!

157
00:13:54,717 --> 00:13:58,550
[Sanzo] Pardon me, but don't
these guys know they're suppose
to be our enemies?

158
00:13:58,650 --> 00:14:02,450
Yeah, so what do you call that
thing on your shoulders, huh?

159
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:06,083
Hey, come on guys, I want to
fight the big crab monster too!

160
00:14:06,183 --> 00:14:10,050
After all, wasn't I the one who
defeated him the last time!

161
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:12,950
Actually, this one looks
different from the last one.

162
00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:14,017
So what?

163
00:14:14,117 --> 00:14:15,417
[Sanzo] Will you get off?

164
00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:19,883
No, it's time to give your
brother a shot at it.

165
00:14:21,917 --> 00:14:26,683
Evil spirit, wake! Rise from
your slumber in the demon plane
and be made manifest.

166
00:14:26,783 --> 00:14:31,517
I summon you from your sleep to
wake in this world and protect
the souls of the living.

167
00:14:34,083 --> 00:14:38,683
Well, well, how are we all
enjoying my little celebration?

168
00:14:46,517 --> 00:14:49,483
Oh my, your friend
is certainly...

169
00:14:52,317 --> 00:14:54,283
...quite energetic.

170
00:14:55,783 --> 00:14:57,317
Cho Gonou!

171
00:14:58,517 --> 00:15:01,650
Come! Fiends of flame,
fires of hell, I call on you!

172
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:05,617
Inhabitants in the other world,
I draw upon your power in
this one.

173
00:15:05,717 --> 00:15:10,117
Show me your strength in light!
I conjure up your presence in a
mighty flame,

174
00:15:10,217 --> 00:15:13,417
so that I may send my enemies
back from where they came!

175
00:15:16,083 --> 00:15:20,350
[Chin] Enjoy it while you can,
bumbling travelers.

176
00:15:20,450 --> 00:15:23,850
For you are all fated to die.

177
00:15:25,983 --> 00:15:28,083
Say, Cho Gonou,

178
00:15:28,183 --> 00:15:31,783
it seems that the more we have,

179
00:15:31,883 --> 00:15:35,950
the more precious things we have
to lose.

180
00:15:36,050 --> 00:15:38,183
Come on! Do it already!

181
00:15:39,383 --> 00:15:40,783
You get ready to dodge!

182
00:15:40,883 --> 00:15:44,517
You don't want to be near this
thing when it goes off.

183
00:15:44,617 --> 00:15:49,783
I am sick and tired of fighting
other people's battles for them.
I'm no one's stooge.

184
00:15:49,883 --> 00:15:54,017
I can never be strong enough as
long as I'm doing the biddings
of others!

185
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:59,683
From now on, I fight only
for myself!

186
00:15:59,783 --> 00:16:01,517
Will you shut up?

187
00:16:01,617 --> 00:16:03,117
Just throw it!

188
00:16:11,583 --> 00:16:13,417
Hurry up, you jerk!

189
00:16:13,517 --> 00:16:18,917
I command you! Come forth,
Flaming Fiends of Hell!

190
00:16:57,383 --> 00:17:01,750
[Koushu] I sense a disturuption
of demonic power in the East.
Explain.

191
00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:06,583
Yes, I'm afraid it seems Lord
Kougaiji decided to summon
a friend.

192
00:17:06,683 --> 00:17:08,683
Has he?

193
00:17:08,783 --> 00:17:11,017
You don't seem very concerned.

194
00:17:11,117 --> 00:17:15,283
And exactly why should I be
concenred, Ni?

195
00:17:15,383 --> 00:17:17,083
I don't know.

196
00:17:17,183 --> 00:17:20,417
It doesn't really matter to me
either way.

197
00:17:21,783 --> 00:17:24,517
Tell me, is Lirin safe?

198
00:17:24,617 --> 00:17:30,683
[Wang] What's this? The Lady
Koushu showing concern for her
daughter's well being?

199
00:17:30,783 --> 00:17:33,783
Spare me. I need her to
revive Gyumaoh.

200
00:17:33,883 --> 00:17:37,583
That is what Professor Ni tells
me is to be believed.

201
00:17:38,817 --> 00:17:40,550
Isn't that right, doctor?

202
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:47,650
I do recall you making such a
claim to me.

203
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:53,650
No, I am a scientist I report
what my research tell me but
never advocate.

204
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:55,317
Whatever, it doesn't matter.

205
00:17:55,417 --> 00:18:00,417
I'll revive Gyumaoh with my own
two hands if I have to.

206
00:18:00,517 --> 00:18:04,150
No obstical is so great it will
keep me from you, my love.

207
00:18:27,139 --> 00:18:29,419
Did we get him?

208
00:18:29,419 --> 00:18:30,552
[Gojyo] I hope so.

209
00:18:32,519 --> 00:18:34,486
[Goku] What are you looking at?

210
00:18:34,586 --> 00:18:38,119
I believe that's enough fighting
for one day, gentlemen.

211
00:18:38,219 --> 00:18:40,986
If you'll excuse us, we'll
be off.

212
00:18:44,519 --> 00:18:48,786
It was rude of me to have sought
you out before I knew what I was
fighting for.

213
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:52,052
Next time it will be different.

214
00:18:52,152 --> 00:18:55,686
I will hit you with everything
I have.

215
00:18:55,786 --> 00:18:59,586
On my own terms. So...

216
00:19:02,652 --> 00:19:04,152
Better watch your back, boy.

217
00:19:04,252 --> 00:19:07,119
If I remember correctly you
still owe my a couple of licks.

218
00:19:07,219 --> 00:19:09,786
Put it on my tab. You know I'm
good for it.

219
00:19:09,886 --> 00:19:13,852
Sanzo, I have to go now, but
we'll play together real
soon, okay?

220
00:19:13,952 --> 00:19:16,086
Why don't you go play with
someone your own age?

221
00:19:16,186 --> 00:19:18,786
Next time remember to bring
a souvenir, okay?

222
00:19:18,886 --> 00:19:21,386
The least you could do is buy me
a drink, man.

223
00:19:21,486 --> 00:19:23,719
I'm just glad I wasn't the one
who injured you.

224
00:19:23,819 --> 00:19:26,219
You're the cutes guy I ever
tried to kill.

225
00:19:30,752 --> 00:19:34,486
For bad guys, they're not so bad
after all.

226
00:19:34,586 --> 00:19:38,852
First they try to kill us, then
they try to help us. Makes
you wonder.

227
00:19:38,952 --> 00:19:41,086
They're probably someone
else's pawns.

228
00:19:41,186 --> 00:19:45,752
As far as I'm concerned our main
quarrel is with someone else.

229
00:19:45,852 --> 00:19:49,919
[Sanzo] I have a feeling they
work for the fools who are
trying to resurrect gyumaoh.

230
00:19:51,786 --> 00:19:53,752
And bring chaos to the world.

231
00:19:54,552 --> 00:19:57,352
That is our true enemy.

232
00:19:57,452 --> 00:20:00,219
At any rate, I suggest we blow
this town.

233
00:20:00,319 --> 00:20:01,686
[Gojyo] What's left of it.

234
00:20:05,886 --> 00:20:08,186
<i>[Hakkai] Is this the heart of</i>
<i>the shikigami?</i>

235
00:20:24,386 --> 00:20:28,386
But I can see the darkness
behind those eyes!

236
00:20:30,519 --> 00:20:32,786
What's the matter? What the
hell's wrong with you?

237
00:20:33,986 --> 00:20:35,319
[Hakkai] It- It's nothing.

238
00:20:43,219 --> 00:20:47,252
<i>Those eyes... I've seen them</i>
<i>somewhere before.</i>

239
00:20:47,352 --> 00:20:48,519
<i>But where?</i>

240
00:22:29,152 --> 00:22:32,486
[Goku] He wears a religious
scripture around his shoulders
like a vest.

241
00:22:32,586 --> 00:22:35,319
And dons the crimson chakra on
his brow.

242
00:22:35,419 --> 00:22:38,619
He fights demons with three
warriors at his side.

243
00:22:38,719 --> 00:22:41,686
Hey, this sounds like I'm
describing Sanzo, right?

244
00:22:41,786 --> 00:22:44,519
So why did it also happen 400
years ago?

245
00:22:44,619 --> 00:22:49,086
Hmmm? "Fake Saviors,"
next time on Saiyuki.
