1
00:01:52,374 --> 00:01:55,107
[Zenon] Is the squad
already on the move?

2
00:01:59,907 --> 00:02:05,374
[Shien] Yes. I have sent
two of our best Special
Forces operatives.

3
00:02:06,541 --> 00:02:07,674
[Zenon] Two?

4
00:02:08,707 --> 00:02:10,374
[Shien] Any more would be...

5
00:02:10,474 --> 00:02:12,774
over doing it. Don't you think?

6
00:02:12,874 --> 00:02:14,574
[Zenon] That's true.

7
00:02:14,674 --> 00:02:17,207
Any signs yet of demon activity?

8
00:02:17,307 --> 00:02:20,674
[Shien] I haven't received
any reports as of yet.

9
00:02:21,774 --> 00:02:23,341
Besides...

10
00:02:23,441 --> 00:02:24,841
[Zenon] Besides?

11
00:02:24,941 --> 00:02:28,807
[Shien] I wouldn't think they'd
be anything to worry about.

12
00:02:28,907 --> 00:02:30,707
Do you?

13
00:02:30,807 --> 00:02:34,807
[Zenon] Hmph. Which means
there's nothing for us to
do but just sit here.

14
00:02:36,407 --> 00:02:37,774
[Homura] Not necessarily.

15
00:02:43,507 --> 00:02:44,641
Let's go.

16
00:02:47,674 --> 00:02:50,474
[Zenon] Go? Go where?

17
00:02:56,174 --> 00:02:57,907
To watch them.

18
00:03:02,907 --> 00:03:04,974
[Goku] "The War Prince Returns."

19
00:03:23,641 --> 00:03:29,241
[Gojyo sighs] You know, it feels
like forever since we've had a
chance to relax like this.

20
00:03:29,341 --> 00:03:32,207
[Sanzo] That must mean you have
a really good hand, Gojyo.

21
00:03:32,307 --> 00:03:33,441
[Gojyo] Dagnabit.

22
00:03:34,907 --> 00:03:37,607
You know, come to think of
it, Gojyo's absolutely right.

23
00:03:37,707 --> 00:03:39,641
Seems like any day we
didn't run into a demon,

24
00:03:39,741 --> 00:03:42,874
we ran into a gang of angry,
murderous gods instead.

25
00:03:42,974 --> 00:03:46,541
Ah, excellent!
I'll take that one.

26
00:03:46,641 --> 00:03:49,474
[Goku] Hey, Homura's
a god, isn't he?

27
00:03:49,574 --> 00:03:52,441
What would a god
want with us anyway?

28
00:03:53,807 --> 00:03:56,307
Who knows? He's not nearly as

29
00:03:56,407 --> 00:03:59,441
cute as the babe we ran into
a few months before, huh?

30
00:04:03,541 --> 00:04:06,074
Nor as friendly.

31
00:04:06,174 --> 00:04:09,574
Sanzo, what is your take
on this Homura character?

32
00:04:09,674 --> 00:04:10,807
[Sanzo] Hard to say.

33
00:04:12,174 --> 00:04:15,174
It doesn't change anything.
Whatever their motivations are,

34
00:04:15,274 --> 00:04:18,774
our objective remains the same.

35
00:04:18,874 --> 00:04:20,541
[Gojyo] Keep heading west.

36
00:04:21,307 --> 00:04:22,974
[Sanzo] That's right.

37
00:04:23,074 --> 00:04:24,541
[Goku] West, huh?
[Hakuryu squeaks]

38
00:04:24,641 --> 00:04:27,174
[Goku] I wonder what
Kougaiji's up to?

39
00:04:27,274 --> 00:04:31,107
[Gojyo] Heh. They wouldn't
die if you killed them.

40
00:04:31,207 --> 00:04:33,174
[Goku] Yeah, but...

41
00:04:35,107 --> 00:04:39,541
[Hakkai] There's no use
worrying. What happens happens.

42
00:04:39,641 --> 00:04:41,641
[Sanzo] That pretty
much sums it up.

43
00:04:41,741 --> 00:04:44,841
Anticipating someone else's
move can cost you dearly.

44
00:04:47,407 --> 00:04:49,274
[Sanzo] Kong! I win.

45
00:05:01,774 --> 00:05:02,907
[Sanzo] Damn.

46
00:05:05,741 --> 00:05:07,607
[Goku] Where ya goin', Sanzo?

47
00:05:07,707 --> 00:05:09,007
I wanna go too!

48
00:05:10,441 --> 00:05:12,074
[Sanzo] Do what you want.

49
00:05:13,441 --> 00:05:14,641
I'm not getting food.

50
00:05:15,641 --> 00:05:16,774
[Goku] Aaaaw.

51
00:05:20,574 --> 00:05:22,507
[Hakkai] Where did
those two run off to?

52
00:05:24,441 --> 00:05:27,274
[Gojyo] I think he ran out
to get some cigarettes.

53
00:05:27,374 --> 00:05:29,074
[Hakkai] You think that's wise?

54
00:05:30,107 --> 00:05:31,474
Like Sanzo just said.

55
00:05:31,574 --> 00:05:35,274
None of us know what's waiting
for us just around the corner.

56
00:05:35,374 --> 00:05:38,274
[Gojyo] He can take care
of himself, so let it go.

57
00:05:39,341 --> 00:05:41,874
[Hakkai] I suppose you're right.

58
00:05:41,974 --> 00:05:44,874
How 'bout a game of cards in the
meantime?

59
00:05:45,641 --> 00:05:47,374
[Gojyo] You read my mind.

60
00:05:49,507 --> 00:05:50,674
[Goku] Hey, Sanzo.

61
00:05:51,207 --> 00:05:52,641
[Sanzo] No.

62
00:05:52,741 --> 00:05:53,841
[Goku] Come on, Sanzo!

63
00:05:53,941 --> 00:05:54,874
[Sanzo] Be quiet.

64
00:05:54,974 --> 00:05:55,774
Sanzo!

65
00:05:55,874 --> 00:05:56,841
Shut up.

66
00:05:56,941 --> 00:05:58,141
But Sanzo!

67
00:05:58,241 --> 00:06:00,107
You don't know
what I'll ask you!

68
00:06:00,207 --> 00:06:05,107
Okay then. Just don't ask
something stupid, you got that?

69
00:06:05,207 --> 00:06:06,707
There's a ramen stand over-

70
00:06:07,807 --> 00:06:10,341
See there? That was
a dumb question!

71
00:06:10,441 --> 00:06:11,807
Ow...

72
00:06:14,174 --> 00:06:16,574
[Soldier 1] Genjo
Sanzo, I presume.

73
00:06:28,707 --> 00:06:30,441
Are you all right, Gojyo?

74
00:06:32,741 --> 00:06:34,641
[Gojyo] Yeah, just barely.

75
00:06:35,974 --> 00:06:37,874
Bit excessive, don't you think?

76
00:06:37,974 --> 00:06:40,707
Blowing up an entire
inn like that?

77
00:06:40,807 --> 00:06:43,807
[Gojyo] Sheesh. And I
had a killer hand too.

78
00:06:45,074 --> 00:06:46,207
[Gojyo] Up there!

79
00:06:49,374 --> 00:06:50,941
Is that a demon?

80
00:06:51,041 --> 00:06:53,774
[Hakkai] I believe that's a god.

81
00:06:53,874 --> 00:06:55,741
I'll take care of the sidekicks.

82
00:06:58,307 --> 00:06:59,441
Whoa, shit.

83
00:07:06,707 --> 00:07:07,874
<i>[Sanzo] Damn!</i>

84
00:07:12,407 --> 00:07:15,541
What the-?! Is he taking
the town with us or what?!

85
00:07:15,641 --> 00:07:16,774
[Soldier 1] That's right!

86
00:07:17,241 --> 00:07:18,374
Die!

87
00:07:22,907 --> 00:07:26,474
Hey, Hakkai, what are
we running for anyway?

88
00:07:26,574 --> 00:07:29,674
We've got to try to draw his
fire away from the village.

89
00:07:29,774 --> 00:07:30,907
Besides...

90
00:07:31,974 --> 00:07:34,574
Damn, they mean business too.

91
00:07:35,307 --> 00:07:36,674
Besides, what?

92
00:07:36,774 --> 00:07:39,174
[Hakkai] I'm worried
about Sanzo and Goku.

93
00:07:39,274 --> 00:07:42,207
[Gojyo] What for?

94
00:07:42,307 --> 00:07:47,374
Well, I'm afraid those two
just might destroy the
entire village.

95
00:07:47,474 --> 00:07:49,574
I didn't get supplies yet.

96
00:07:50,007 --> 00:07:51,607
Uh oh.

97
00:07:51,707 --> 00:07:53,274
Buckle your seatbelt.

98
00:07:53,374 --> 00:07:56,107
I'm gonna have to start
hauling serious ass.

99
00:08:01,174 --> 00:08:01,974
[Soldier 1] This is it?

100
00:08:02,074 --> 00:08:04,207
Is what it?!

101
00:08:04,307 --> 00:08:08,374
I expected so much more from
you four so-called heroes.

102
00:08:08,507 --> 00:08:12,874
It appears that we have
gravely overestimated the
legendary Sanzo party.

103
00:08:12,974 --> 00:08:14,907
[Sanzo] Oh, you did, did you?

104
00:08:15,007 --> 00:08:16,474
Estimate this!

105
00:08:31,841 --> 00:08:33,974
Good job!

106
00:08:34,074 --> 00:08:36,041
[Sanzo] You're one of
Homura's thugs, aren't you?

107
00:08:39,007 --> 00:08:42,074
Talk! What are they after?

108
00:08:55,007 --> 00:08:56,307
[Goku & Sanzo] What?!

109
00:08:59,307 --> 00:09:00,774
[Goku] What'd you do that for?!

110
00:09:00,874 --> 00:09:02,841
Isn't he one of your comrades?!

111
00:09:02,941 --> 00:09:07,607
Any one of us would gladly give
up our lives for Lord Homura.

112
00:09:07,707 --> 00:09:12,341
One life is meaningless
when compared to Homura's
greater cause.

113
00:09:15,241 --> 00:09:18,174
[Soldier 2 yells in pain]

114
00:09:24,141 --> 00:09:29,707
Moron. That's what you get for
pausing in the middle of battle
to make pretty speeches.

115
00:09:32,474 --> 00:09:34,441
I hope you two weren't hurt.

116
00:09:34,541 --> 00:09:36,507
[Goku] Yeah, we're okay.

117
00:09:36,607 --> 00:09:37,507
[Hakkai chuckles]

118
00:09:37,607 --> 00:09:38,741
[Hakkai] You know,
come to think of it,

119
00:09:38,841 --> 00:09:40,841
it had been too
quiet lately.

120
00:09:40,941 --> 00:09:44,207
[Gojyo] People just don't tire
of trying to kill us, do they?

121
00:09:44,307 --> 00:09:48,174
[Gojyo sighs deeply]
[Hakkai] It's not easy
being a celebrity.

122
00:09:48,307 --> 00:09:51,474
[Sanzo] And the real stalkers
have yet to make an appearance.

123
00:09:51,574 --> 00:09:52,707
[Gojyo & Hakkai] Huh?

124
00:10:00,207 --> 00:10:01,341
[Goku] Homura!

125
00:10:17,408 --> 00:10:20,609
[Jiroushin] You're not observing
the Lower World again, are you?

126
00:10:20,609 --> 00:10:24,376
[Goddess] Of course.
Can you think of a better
way to pass the time?

127
00:10:24,509 --> 00:10:28,809
Sure beats the
drudgery that passes
for entertainment up here.

128
00:10:28,909 --> 00:10:32,943
Be more careful. It's extremely
dangerous to say such things.

129
00:10:34,943 --> 00:10:36,309
[Goddess] It's starting.

130
00:10:36,409 --> 00:10:37,543
[Jiroushin] Lady?

131
00:10:39,076 --> 00:10:42,809
The sequel to the battle between
outlaws and misfits has begun.

132
00:10:42,909 --> 00:10:45,876
Wouldn't you like
a ringside seat?

133
00:10:45,976 --> 00:10:48,843
[Jiroushin] My Lady...
To say such things.

134
00:10:53,309 --> 00:10:55,976
[Goddess] I can't wait
to see what happens next.

135
00:10:59,776 --> 00:11:01,409
Long time no see.

136
00:11:02,276 --> 00:11:03,709
Not long enough.

137
00:11:03,809 --> 00:11:08,709
I'm just watching. I wanted
to see you guys fight.

138
00:11:08,809 --> 00:11:13,009
Looks like you got what you
came for. You can go now.

139
00:11:13,109 --> 00:11:14,509
Phenomenal...

140
00:11:14,609 --> 00:11:17,176
is what'd I'd like
to say, but...

141
00:11:17,276 --> 00:11:20,543
I'm afraid you're not
quite there yet.

142
00:11:20,643 --> 00:11:24,343
Son Goku, the same goes for you.

143
00:11:24,443 --> 00:11:27,976
Only a god... would
be so melodramatic.

144
00:11:28,076 --> 00:11:30,476
Come on, what do you want?

145
00:11:30,576 --> 00:11:35,276
Don't you worry. We're
just here to watch today.

146
00:11:35,376 --> 00:11:37,209
Does that mean you're
just going to take off?

147
00:11:37,309 --> 00:11:39,409
Why don't you stay and
play a little while?

148
00:11:39,509 --> 00:11:44,543
I really don't think you and
your friends are prepared for
this level of fighting yet.

149
00:11:44,643 --> 00:11:49,376
Oh please. That little skirmish
wasn't even an appetizer.

150
00:11:49,476 --> 00:11:51,376
[Zenon] I'm glad to hear it.

151
00:11:51,476 --> 00:11:54,776
I'd hate to have come all
the way out here for nothing.

152
00:11:55,576 --> 00:11:57,076
[Goku] Okay then!

153
00:11:57,176 --> 00:11:59,676
Stop talking and
let's get it on!

154
00:12:03,176 --> 00:12:04,309
What?!

155
00:12:08,909 --> 00:12:13,276
Hold it. Looks like you boys
will be fighting us today.

156
00:12:13,376 --> 00:12:19,243
It is Homura's wish that none of
you interfere with this process.

157
00:12:19,343 --> 00:12:21,976
[Hakkai] You're awfully
confident in your abilities.

158
00:12:22,076 --> 00:12:25,576
[Gojyo] It's three against two,
guys. Don't think about begging
for forgiveness later,

159
00:12:25,676 --> 00:12:27,576
'cause I won't be in the mood.

160
00:12:27,676 --> 00:12:28,609
Heh.

161
00:12:28,709 --> 00:12:30,543
I'm not the begging type.

162
00:12:32,276 --> 00:12:33,643
[Sanzo] Keep your guard up.

163
00:12:33,743 --> 00:12:36,276
They're losers, but
they're still gods.

164
00:12:36,376 --> 00:12:39,876
[Gojyo] You don't have to
tell me, man. I've got eyes.

165
00:12:39,976 --> 00:12:44,676
[Hakkai] All you have to do is
look at them to see we've got
a real fight on our hands.

166
00:12:44,776 --> 00:12:47,143
[Sanzo] I'm just saying.

167
00:12:47,243 --> 00:12:48,543
[Gojyo] Stop stalling.

168
00:12:48,643 --> 00:12:49,943
[Hakkai] Shall we go then?

169
00:12:53,709 --> 00:12:54,843
[Goku] There!

170
00:12:55,276 --> 00:12:56,409
Take that!

171
00:12:58,743 --> 00:13:01,276
What's the matter, Goku?

172
00:13:01,376 --> 00:13:04,143
Surely, you ought to be
able to at least touch me.

173
00:13:05,843 --> 00:13:06,976
Come now!

174
00:13:08,109 --> 00:13:10,776
Show me some of
your true mettle.

175
00:13:10,876 --> 00:13:12,609
Don't get too cocky!

176
00:13:14,476 --> 00:13:17,009
<i>[Homura] Be strong, Son Goku!</i>

177
00:13:17,109 --> 00:13:20,343
[Hakkai groans in strain]

178
00:13:20,443 --> 00:13:24,443
<i>[Hakkai] He's not giving</i>
<i>me a chance to lower my</i>
<i>defensive barrier!</i>

179
00:13:24,543 --> 00:13:28,276
<i>I've got to find a way</i>
<i>to go on the offensive.</i>

180
00:13:28,376 --> 00:13:32,076
<i>[Shien] How long do you</i>
<i>intend to hide behind</i>
<i>this protective shield?</i>

181
00:13:32,176 --> 00:13:34,609
<i>Maintaining your chi</i>
<i>cannot be easy.</i>

182
00:13:35,209 --> 00:13:36,343
Lay off him!

183
00:13:37,043 --> 00:13:38,676
Try that on for size!

184
00:13:41,643 --> 00:13:42,776
Hakkai?

185
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:49,409
[Zenon chuckles]

186
00:13:49,509 --> 00:13:52,609
Well, I guess you won't
be drinking for a while.

187
00:13:53,843 --> 00:13:54,976
Kenren...

188
00:13:55,809 --> 00:13:57,576
[Single gunshot]

189
00:14:08,909 --> 00:14:12,243
You're not so high and
mighty after all...

190
00:14:12,343 --> 00:14:13,476
are you?

191
00:14:22,109 --> 00:14:23,676
<i>[Homura] Don't hold back.</i>

192
00:14:23,776 --> 00:14:26,343
<i>It's the only way</i>
<i>you'll grow stronger.</i>

193
00:14:27,943 --> 00:14:30,076
<i>[Goku] It's just too much.</i>

194
00:14:30,176 --> 00:14:34,109
<i>None of the guys I've</i>
<i>fought before even come</i>
<i>close to this guy.</i>

195
00:14:35,076 --> 00:14:36,976
<i>He's not even trying!</i>

196
00:14:39,243 --> 00:14:41,309
Is that all you've got?

197
00:14:41,409 --> 00:14:43,709
You kidding? Hell no!

198
00:14:48,309 --> 00:14:50,076
That wasn't bad.

199
00:14:50,176 --> 00:14:52,076
But you're too obvious.

200
00:14:52,176 --> 00:14:54,376
Don't let me anticipate.

201
00:14:54,476 --> 00:14:58,076
Well, smartass. Let's see if
you can anticipate this move-!

202
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:10,509
You should be aware...

203
00:15:10,609 --> 00:15:13,809
you're facing a rather
critical decision here.

204
00:15:14,843 --> 00:15:16,776
Why... why you...

205
00:15:21,176 --> 00:15:24,343
This guy won't give
us a break, Sanzo.

206
00:15:24,476 --> 00:15:27,076
How much ammo does that
thing have anyway?

207
00:15:27,576 --> 00:15:28,943
Whining, are we?

208
00:15:29,043 --> 00:15:33,609
Yeah, right. I just don't like
being toyed with, that's all.

209
00:15:33,709 --> 00:15:39,176
Me either. I won't be
happy until the gods
have been dethroned.

210
00:15:39,276 --> 00:15:42,643
And I don't like leaving
Goku with that guy.

211
00:15:42,743 --> 00:15:45,176
Well that certainly is a first.

212
00:15:45,276 --> 00:15:47,576
We're all in agreement for once.

213
00:15:48,309 --> 00:15:50,409
Right, let's go!

214
00:16:08,909 --> 00:16:11,343
<i>[Goku] They're... beating</i>
<i>the crap out of us.</i>

215
00:16:16,509 --> 00:16:17,643
Oh no...

216
00:16:30,243 --> 00:16:32,043
What should I do?

217
00:16:32,176 --> 00:16:33,743
[Homura] Aren't you
going to take it off?

218
00:16:38,909 --> 00:16:43,409
Take it off. Why not fight
me at your full potential?

219
00:16:44,876 --> 00:16:47,343
[Goku] I won't do it.

220
00:16:47,443 --> 00:16:51,143
I'd rather die than take
it off for the likes of you!

221
00:16:55,043 --> 00:16:57,709
So be it, Son Goku.

222
00:16:59,309 --> 00:17:01,643
I'm gonna do it this time!

223
00:17:01,743 --> 00:17:04,176
I've only got one more chance!

224
00:17:06,843 --> 00:17:07,976
HALT!

225
00:17:09,443 --> 00:17:10,576
No...

226
00:17:16,776 --> 00:17:18,376
Grow stronger.

227
00:17:19,543 --> 00:17:22,676
You must grow stronger,
Son Goku.

228
00:17:30,209 --> 00:17:31,343
Goku!

229
00:18:01,324 --> 00:18:03,826
Zenon, Shien. Let's go.

230
00:18:03,826 --> 00:18:04,959
No way!

231
00:18:07,326 --> 00:18:10,226
Man, if you say so.

232
00:18:10,326 --> 00:18:14,893
<i>[Shien] Is this really</i>
<i>what you want, Homura?</i>

233
00:18:15,026 --> 00:18:19,293
[Sanzo] Hold it! You're not
planning on leaving unfinished
business again, are you?

234
00:18:19,393 --> 00:18:21,659
Quit toying with us and
let's get this over with!

235
00:18:21,759 --> 00:18:24,159
[Homura] I've done
everything I've come to do.

236
00:18:25,959 --> 00:18:27,826
[Gojyo] I thought you
wanted our Scripture?

237
00:18:27,926 --> 00:18:29,659
Well come and get it, big guy.

238
00:18:31,526 --> 00:18:33,659
[Homura] If I took
the Scripture now,

239
00:18:33,759 --> 00:18:36,626
what excuse would I have
to come see you again?

240
00:18:40,126 --> 00:18:42,226
Isn't that right, Konzen?

241
00:18:44,726 --> 00:18:50,826
<i>[Shien] Homura, you realize,</i>
<i>to leave now would only</i>
<i>constrain their progress.</i>

242
00:18:50,926 --> 00:18:55,193
<i>As of a chain, as those</i>
<i>shackles on your wrists.</i>

243
00:18:56,659 --> 00:19:00,459
[Zenon] Jeez, it's not easy
keeping up with his whims.

244
00:19:04,226 --> 00:19:05,559
[Homura] So long.

245
00:19:15,726 --> 00:19:18,059
[Hakkai] Goku! Are
you all right?!

246
00:19:18,159 --> 00:19:19,293
[Gojyo] Goku!

247
00:19:30,059 --> 00:19:31,126
Huh?

248
00:19:31,226 --> 00:19:33,726
[Hakkai] Goku... Goku!

249
00:19:34,926 --> 00:19:37,393
[Goku whines softly in pain]

250
00:19:37,493 --> 00:19:38,959
[Hakkai] Better take it easy.

251
00:19:40,359 --> 00:19:42,459
You took a hell of
a beating last night.

252
00:19:44,759 --> 00:19:46,759
Oh, right.

253
00:19:46,859 --> 00:19:49,693
I lost... I remember.

254
00:19:49,793 --> 00:19:53,726
Yeah. He really
whipped your ass.

255
00:19:53,826 --> 00:19:55,493
What a loser.

256
00:19:55,626 --> 00:19:58,493
[Goku] Hey, screw
you! I'm no loser.

257
00:19:58,593 --> 00:20:01,726
[Gojyo] No, you're a
weak-ass beat-up monkey.

258
00:20:03,259 --> 00:20:05,493
[Goku] Like you
could do any better!

259
00:20:05,593 --> 00:20:07,093
[Gojyo] What did you say?!

260
00:20:07,193 --> 00:20:08,526
[Sanzo] He's right, you know.

261
00:20:09,593 --> 00:20:11,959
We're in no position
to talk, no.

262
00:20:13,026 --> 00:20:16,026
We're all completely
at their mercy.

263
00:20:18,926 --> 00:20:21,259
[Goku] I've made up my mind.

264
00:20:21,359 --> 00:20:25,626
I know he's stronger than I
am, but next time I see him...

265
00:20:25,726 --> 00:20:29,793
I promise, I won't lose again.

266
00:20:29,893 --> 00:20:33,693
[Gojyo] In that case,
you better concentrate on
getting your strength back.

267
00:20:33,793 --> 00:20:38,293
[Hakkai] Come to think of it,
I did see a nice Chinese
restaurant nearby.

268
00:20:38,393 --> 00:20:41,193
[Goku] Now that you mention
it, I am kind of hungry!

269
00:20:41,293 --> 00:20:42,393
[Sanzo] Thanks a lot, Hakkai!

270
00:20:42,493 --> 00:20:43,893
Now we'll never
hear the end of it!

271
00:20:43,993 --> 00:20:45,193
[Goku] Come on, guys!

272
00:20:45,293 --> 00:20:47,226
Just an order of eggrolls!
