1
00:01:34,355 --> 00:01:36,422
I love your hands.

2
00:01:36,522 --> 00:01:39,022
You have such beautiful fingers.

3
00:01:39,122 --> 00:01:42,022
Is it weird to describe a man
as beautiful?

4
00:01:42,122 --> 00:01:44,122
[Hakkai] I would have done
anything for you.

5
00:01:47,255 --> 00:01:48,522
[Hakkai] Let's go home, Kanan!

6
00:01:48,622 --> 00:01:51,288
I'll protect you!

7
00:01:51,388 --> 00:01:54,488
I'm sorry my love, but it's too
late for that.

8
00:02:01,488 --> 00:02:03,222
A dream...

9
00:02:04,555 --> 00:02:07,922
And I thought I had forgotten
that whole nasty episode.

10
00:02:18,355 --> 00:02:20,155
"The Laughing Grim Reaper"

11
00:02:26,455 --> 00:02:31,788
[Chin] And a scar, a scar on
your belly.

12
00:02:31,888 --> 00:02:36,488
<i>[Hakkai] Ever since I met that</i>
<i>old geezer, my past wound has</i>
<i>started to ache again.</i>

13
00:02:37,655 --> 00:02:39,655
<i>He obviously blames me for</i>
<i>what happened,</i>

14
00:02:39,755 --> 00:02:42,922
<i>but why does he keep playing</i>
<i>games like this?</i>

15
00:02:44,988 --> 00:02:49,188
I love your hands. You have such
beautiful fingers.

16
00:02:50,488 --> 00:02:52,255
<i>With her blood on my hands,</i>

17
00:02:52,355 --> 00:02:55,722
<i>I can't allow myself to ever</i>
<i>love anyone again.</i>

18
00:02:57,022 --> 00:03:00,822
Now that is one SHORT lifeline.

19
00:03:01,555 --> 00:03:02,922
Ah! You scared me!

20
00:03:03,022 --> 00:03:05,055
Whoa that should be my line.

21
00:03:05,155 --> 00:03:07,988
I can't believe how easy it was
to sneak up on ya.

22
00:03:09,822 --> 00:03:11,755
Okay dude, so which one's
the lifeline?

23
00:03:11,855 --> 00:03:13,522
Hm? That one right here.

24
00:03:13,622 --> 00:03:15,555
[Hakkai] Boy you're right.
It is short.

25
00:03:15,655 --> 00:03:18,255
See? Mine goes all the way down
to the wrist.

26
00:03:18,355 --> 00:03:21,222
[Hakkai laughs nervously]

27
00:03:21,322 --> 00:03:22,788
[Hakkai] Did you wake up to tell
me that?

28
00:03:24,188 --> 00:03:25,555
[Gojyo] No, not really.

29
00:03:28,622 --> 00:03:32,755
I just wanted to get a good look
at that gloomy face of yours.

30
00:03:34,955 --> 00:03:39,455
So, the seer, that's what this
is about?

31
00:03:39,555 --> 00:03:42,588
Yes it's Chin Yisou...

32
00:03:42,688 --> 00:03:43,822
Hello!

33
00:03:44,988 --> 00:03:47,322
Hello! Hello!

34
00:03:47,422 --> 00:03:51,188
Cho Gonou you will die.
You'll die.

35
00:03:51,288 --> 00:03:55,055
Why does that toy call you by
your old name?

36
00:03:56,255 --> 00:03:59,588
It says hate. Chin Yisou!

37
00:03:59,688 --> 00:04:05,722
[Doll] You're a very bad man,
Cho Gonou! That is why you shall
never know peace in this life.

38
00:04:05,822 --> 00:04:10,622
Or any other. That's because,
you are a big fat blasphemer.

39
00:04:10,722 --> 00:04:14,588
Listen here, you little block
head, let me remind you,
you're flamable.

40
00:04:14,722 --> 00:04:17,655
I think I understand what you're
trying to say.

41
00:04:17,755 --> 00:04:21,188
but if you have unfinished
business with me,

42
00:04:21,288 --> 00:04:23,955
why not speak to me face to face
like a man?

43
00:04:25,722 --> 00:04:30,955
Yes, those are the eyes I know,
show us your true face,
Cho Gonou.

44
00:04:31,055 --> 00:04:32,188
That's it!

45
00:04:33,988 --> 00:04:36,055
You should have stayed in
your box.

46
00:04:36,155 --> 00:04:38,922
[Gojyo] Come on, Hakkai! I've
had enough of this toy.

47
00:04:39,022 --> 00:04:40,222
Play time's over.

48
00:04:40,322 --> 00:04:41,455
[Hakkai] Right.

49
00:04:42,488 --> 00:04:44,088
Hey Gojyo, look out!

50
00:04:47,322 --> 00:04:48,355
Gojyo!

51
00:04:49,355 --> 00:04:50,922
That's what you get!

52
00:04:51,022 --> 00:04:52,155
You little...

53
00:04:55,922 --> 00:04:57,188
[Sanzo] Hakkai,
what's happening?!

54
00:04:57,288 --> 00:04:58,422
[Hakkai] I'm not sure.

55
00:05:11,388 --> 00:05:14,555
Get it out! Get it out of me!

56
00:05:14,655 --> 00:05:15,722
Get it out of me!

57
00:05:15,822 --> 00:05:17,855
W-What's happening?!

58
00:05:17,955 --> 00:05:19,188
I don't know!

59
00:05:19,288 --> 00:05:20,755
It's a seed.

60
00:05:20,855 --> 00:05:22,988
A living seed, taking root
in his veins,

61
00:05:23,088 --> 00:05:25,288
that lives on blood.
He's a goner.

62
00:05:25,388 --> 00:05:27,455
[Goku] Who the hell's
the midget?!

63
00:05:27,555 --> 00:05:29,822
[Hakkai] One of Chin
Yisou's messengers.

64
00:05:30,788 --> 00:05:32,055
Not him again.

65
00:05:32,155 --> 00:05:34,855
Tick tock, tick tock, clock
is ticking,

66
00:05:34,955 --> 00:05:37,488
not much time left for you to
save your friend.

67
00:05:37,588 --> 00:05:40,322
The seed is snugly next to
his heart.

68
00:05:40,422 --> 00:05:44,255
What will you do, Cho Gonou?
What will you do?

69
00:05:44,355 --> 00:05:48,855
Enough. What is it that
you want?

70
00:05:48,955 --> 00:05:55,888
What fun! I really like this
game! Let's play again real
soon, Cho Gonou! I-

71
00:05:57,555 --> 00:06:00,255
[Sanzo] So that's what this
is about.

72
00:06:00,355 --> 00:06:02,888
You know for a puppet he has
quite a sense of humor.

73
00:06:02,988 --> 00:06:04,288
Sanzo...

74
00:06:04,388 --> 00:06:06,322
[Sanzo] Goku, hold down
Gojyo's arms.

75
00:06:06,422 --> 00:06:09,555
[Goku] What? Okay.

76
00:06:09,655 --> 00:06:12,022
[Sanzo] Are you happy now,
old man?

77
00:06:12,122 --> 00:06:13,755
Isn't this what you wanted?!

78
00:06:15,488 --> 00:06:17,322
[Goku] Sanzo, what're
you doing?!

79
00:06:17,422 --> 00:06:20,255
Hakkai, get ready to close
Gojyo's wound.

80
00:06:20,355 --> 00:06:22,955
Are you nuts?! The target is
so small!

81
00:06:23,055 --> 00:06:26,155
It's too close to the heart,
you're going to end up
killing him!

82
00:06:26,255 --> 00:06:28,388
Then I guess I shouldn't miss.

83
00:06:28,488 --> 00:06:31,755
I'm a good aim, if he dies it's
because he has a heart.

84
00:06:31,855 --> 00:06:36,755
What... the hell... do you think
you're... doing?

85
00:06:36,855 --> 00:06:40,588
Shut that mouth, or you might
bite your tongue.

86
00:06:52,322 --> 00:06:54,222
I think I've closed the wound.

87
00:06:54,322 --> 00:06:57,322
He's still unconscious, but his
pulse is normal.

88
00:06:57,422 --> 00:06:59,088
[Goku] That makes one of us.

89
00:07:00,088 --> 00:07:02,855
This is all my fault, isn't it?

90
00:07:02,955 --> 00:07:07,022
I seem to be the one that Chin
Yisou wants so badly.

91
00:07:07,122 --> 00:07:08,422
That's enough.

92
00:07:08,522 --> 00:07:09,955
[Hakkai] It's not!
[Sanzo] Shut up!

93
00:07:10,055 --> 00:07:11,655
You listen to me!

94
00:07:11,755 --> 00:07:13,922
Now cool it! If you lose
it now

95
00:07:14,022 --> 00:07:17,188
that would be exactly what
Chin Yisou wants you to do!

96
00:07:20,622 --> 00:07:22,655
Quickly! Bring water!

97
00:07:22,755 --> 00:07:24,855
[Goku] Right away!
Come on, Hakuryu!

98
00:07:26,755 --> 00:07:31,255
<i>[Sanzo] I was wondering why you</i>
<i>have been getting much sleep</i>
<i>lately, friend.</i>

99
00:07:31,355 --> 00:07:36,055
<i>Somehow, I get the feeling</i>
<i>we've been playing right</i>
<i>according to Chin</i>
<i>Yisou's script.</i>

100
00:07:37,955 --> 00:07:41,855
<i>He placed that seed next to</i>
<i>Gojyo's heart knowing I'd</i>
<i>shoot him in front of you.</i>

101
00:07:41,955 --> 00:07:48,555
<i>I don't know why he hates you,</i>
<i>but it's obvious that geezer</i>
<i>doesn't want you dead.</i>

102
00:07:48,655 --> 00:07:51,155
<i>He has something much worse in</i>
<i>store for you.</i>

103
00:07:52,188 --> 00:07:54,888
<i>He wants to destroy</i>
<i>your spirit.</i>

104
00:07:54,988 --> 00:07:56,688
<i>He wants to make you suffer.</i>

105
00:08:01,155 --> 00:08:03,155
[Hakkai] I found a job, Kanan.

106
00:08:03,255 --> 00:08:07,122
The pay isn't much, but it's
more than enough to live off of.

107
00:08:07,255 --> 00:08:11,255
Will you move in with me?
I love you.

108
00:08:11,355 --> 00:08:13,388
I want to be with you.

109
00:08:13,488 --> 00:08:17,855
[Kanan] Oh Gonou, neither of us
will ever be alone again.

110
00:08:20,822 --> 00:08:22,655
[Hakkai] Kanan, I'm home.

111
00:08:27,922 --> 00:08:29,788
Kanan...

112
00:08:29,888 --> 00:08:33,055
[Villager 1] If we didn't give
them the women, they would have
destroyed us all.

113
00:08:33,155 --> 00:08:35,088
[Villager 2] We had no
other choice.

114
00:08:35,188 --> 00:08:37,088
[Villager 3] Hyakugan Maoh...

115
00:08:37,188 --> 00:08:39,622
Horrible. Horrible!

116
00:08:44,988 --> 00:08:46,122
[Sanzo] You awake?

117
00:08:47,122 --> 00:08:48,455
[Hakkai] Where am I?

118
00:08:48,555 --> 00:08:51,922
[Sanzo] We're still in the
forest. You slept half the
day away.

119
00:08:52,022 --> 00:08:53,288
Have I?

120
00:08:54,755 --> 00:08:57,955
[Sanzo] Do you have any idea who
that damned fortune-teller is?

121
00:08:58,055 --> 00:09:01,322
[Hakkai] No, but he knows about
my past.

122
00:09:01,422 --> 00:09:03,788
[Sanzo] And your old name too.

123
00:09:03,888 --> 00:09:05,688
Yes...

124
00:09:05,788 --> 00:09:09,122
And apparently he can sure hold
a grudge.

125
00:09:09,222 --> 00:09:14,788
You know, I've heard rumors that
are survivors of Hyakugan Maoh's
old clan, my friend.

126
00:09:14,888 --> 00:09:17,188
Hyakugan Maoh...

127
00:09:17,288 --> 00:09:20,322
I thought for sure I killed
every last one of those
monsters.

128
00:09:20,422 --> 00:09:22,888
You should have made sure.

129
00:09:22,988 --> 00:09:25,088
[Gojyo] Funny thing for
a monk to say.

130
00:09:25,188 --> 00:09:26,088
No luck?

131
00:09:26,188 --> 00:09:28,655
Nah, the fog's way too thick.

132
00:09:28,755 --> 00:09:31,488
I can't seem to find
him anywhere.

133
00:09:31,588 --> 00:09:33,388
[Hakkai] What is it?

134
00:09:33,488 --> 00:09:36,555
Goku? Has something happen
to Goku?!

135
00:09:36,655 --> 00:09:39,122
He seems to have disappeared.

136
00:09:39,222 --> 00:09:43,688
We haven't seen him since he
went to fetch some water after
you collapsed.

137
00:09:43,788 --> 00:09:47,322
You stay right here! You're the
one that the bastard wants!

138
00:09:47,455 --> 00:09:51,522
So you expect me to just sit
here while people get hurt
because of me?!

139
00:09:51,622 --> 00:09:56,255
[Sanzo] Ever heard the saying,
"Embrace nothing"?

140
00:09:56,355 --> 00:09:59,555
"If you meet the Buddha, kill
the Buddha."

141
00:09:59,655 --> 00:10:03,155
"If you meet your father, kill
your father."

142
00:10:03,255 --> 00:10:08,122
Only live your life just as it
is. Not bound to anything.

143
00:10:08,222 --> 00:10:10,488
That is what my master
taught me.

144
00:10:12,822 --> 00:10:17,622
That's the reason I continue to
kill who stands in my way.

145
00:10:17,722 --> 00:10:20,722
And it doesn't matter whose
enemy they happen to be.

146
00:10:22,155 --> 00:10:25,255
[Sanzo] Now, if you understand
that, get a hold of yourself.

147
00:10:25,355 --> 00:10:27,588
I don't need excess baggage.

148
00:10:29,655 --> 00:10:30,788
Got it.

149
00:10:35,284 --> 00:10:37,524
[Gojyo] So, what're you
gonna do?

150
00:10:37,524 --> 00:10:38,391
[Sanzo] About what?

151
00:10:38,491 --> 00:10:40,391
[Gojyo] The monkey, man,
the monkey.

152
00:10:40,491 --> 00:10:43,691
The fog isn't lifting and still
no sign of Goku.

153
00:10:43,791 --> 00:10:45,124
We can't get a break.

154
00:10:45,224 --> 00:10:47,891
I just feel like we're following
someone else's script,

155
00:10:47,991 --> 00:10:49,457
and I don't like it.

156
00:10:49,557 --> 00:10:51,757
If he gets any one of us,
he wins.

157
00:10:53,224 --> 00:10:57,957
I ain't dying. And I tell you,
I super-hate to lose.

158
00:10:59,357 --> 00:11:01,191
Don't say super.

159
00:11:01,291 --> 00:11:03,824
[Gojyo] What should I say?
Hella-hate?

160
00:11:03,924 --> 00:11:05,057
[Foot steps]

161
00:11:06,091 --> 00:11:08,124
[Goku] Oh, there you are!

162
00:11:08,224 --> 00:11:09,957
I thought I got left behind!

163
00:11:10,057 --> 00:11:11,257
Goku?

164
00:11:11,357 --> 00:11:12,757
[Gojyo] You stupid monkey!

165
00:11:14,691 --> 00:11:15,691
What were you thinking?!

166
00:11:15,791 --> 00:11:18,091
[Goku] Ow! I just got lost
looking for water!

167
00:11:20,557 --> 00:11:22,724
Goku? You're all right!

168
00:11:23,491 --> 00:11:24,624
Hakkai...

169
00:11:25,357 --> 00:11:27,291
Oh good.

170
00:11:27,391 --> 00:11:30,291
Don't you ever make us worry
like that again. You hear me?

171
00:11:30,391 --> 00:11:32,091
Yeah, sorry.

172
00:11:33,191 --> 00:11:34,791
Goku...

173
00:11:35,857 --> 00:11:37,524
[Sanzo] Where's Hakuryu?

174
00:11:37,624 --> 00:11:40,457
Sorry, I must have lost him on
the way.

175
00:11:40,557 --> 00:11:43,257
Don't worry, I'm sure we'll find
him when the fog lifts.

176
00:11:43,357 --> 00:11:47,091
Now come on, let's get the hell
out of this creepy forest.

177
00:11:47,191 --> 00:11:48,091
[Sanzo] Goku...

178
00:11:48,191 --> 00:11:49,324
Yeah?

179
00:11:53,257 --> 00:11:55,024
S-Sanzo?!

180
00:11:55,124 --> 00:11:56,624
What's gotten into you?!

181
00:11:59,257 --> 00:12:00,624
S-Sanzo...

182
00:12:00,724 --> 00:12:02,291
What're you doing, man?

183
00:12:02,391 --> 00:12:04,391
S-Sanzo!

184
00:12:04,524 --> 00:12:06,324
Come on, Sanzo.

185
00:12:07,124 --> 00:12:08,524
Sanzo!

186
00:12:10,524 --> 00:12:13,557
Wh-What are you doing, Sanzo?

187
00:12:13,657 --> 00:12:17,257
Who ever you are, you sure as
hell ain't no monkey.

188
00:12:17,357 --> 00:12:19,291
[Goku] It's me, Sanzo!

189
00:12:19,391 --> 00:12:21,991
[Sanzo] Is that so?

190
00:12:22,091 --> 00:12:26,324
Then let's see if the little
chimp, can do a back flip.

191
00:12:40,491 --> 00:12:43,124
Come on out, Chin Yisou.

192
00:12:43,224 --> 00:12:45,657
You've made Sanzo awfully angry.

193
00:12:47,024 --> 00:12:49,824
[Chin laughs]

194
00:12:49,924 --> 00:12:52,724
[Chin] That was one of my best
puppets too.

195
00:12:52,824 --> 00:12:55,457
So tell me, what gave him away?

196
00:12:56,624 --> 00:12:59,391
Should have done your homework.

197
00:12:59,491 --> 00:13:01,957
Yeah, he didn't say "I'm
hungry" once.

198
00:13:06,424 --> 00:13:08,324
"I'm hungry," is that all
it was?

199
00:13:09,324 --> 00:13:11,224
Well who would have thunk it.

200
00:13:11,324 --> 00:13:13,157
What have you done with Goku?

201
00:13:13,257 --> 00:13:16,991
Well now, where do you think
he is?

202
00:13:17,091 --> 00:13:20,591
Perhaps he's simply wandering
around in the fog.

203
00:13:20,691 --> 00:13:21,824
Then again...

204
00:13:34,124 --> 00:13:35,924
[Sanzo] I won't miss next time.

205
00:13:36,024 --> 00:13:36,924
Now where is he?

206
00:13:37,024 --> 00:13:39,457
My my, aren't we impatient?

207
00:13:39,557 --> 00:13:41,757
Are you sure you're getting
enough calcium?

208
00:13:41,857 --> 00:13:44,457
Why don't you just put a bullet
in me now?

209
00:13:44,591 --> 00:13:48,424
That is, if you think you're
able to.

210
00:13:51,891 --> 00:13:53,324
[Gojyo] Ah shit!

211
00:13:53,424 --> 00:13:54,291
Centipedes!

212
00:13:56,691 --> 00:14:00,557
Hyakugan Maoh was a
centipede demon.

213
00:14:00,657 --> 00:14:03,857
Don't move too much now,
or they'll bite.

214
00:14:05,157 --> 00:14:10,257
That much poison could cost you
your life. Even for you.

215
00:14:12,924 --> 00:14:15,424
Are you angry?

216
00:14:15,524 --> 00:14:18,091
Take a good long look

217
00:14:18,224 --> 00:14:22,957
at the son of the who raped and
impregnated your woman!

218
00:14:23,557 --> 00:14:24,691
Think back!

219
00:14:33,791 --> 00:14:35,691
<i>[Hakkai] I can hear the rain</i>
<i>drumming in my ears.</i>

220
00:14:41,191 --> 00:14:44,324
Who the hell are you?

221
00:14:45,591 --> 00:14:47,624
<i>The drumming is so loud.</i>

222
00:14:50,691 --> 00:14:52,657
<i>It's driving me crazy.</i>

223
00:14:57,324 --> 00:15:00,224
[Hakkai] Kanan?! Kanan!

224
00:15:01,024 --> 00:15:02,457
Kanan!

225
00:15:02,557 --> 00:15:04,124
[Kanan] Gonou.

226
00:15:04,224 --> 00:15:05,924
Gonou! Gonou!

227
00:15:06,957 --> 00:15:09,557
[Hakkai] Thank goodness
you're alive!

228
00:15:10,657 --> 00:15:16,491
You don't have to
suffer anymore, Kanan.

229
00:15:17,624 --> 00:15:18,757
Let's go home.

230
00:15:21,424 --> 00:15:26,291
Gonou, I can't. It's too late
for me.

231
00:15:27,324 --> 00:15:29,557
Kanan! What are you...

232
00:15:31,091 --> 00:15:35,157
[Kanan] That monster's child
grows inside of me.

233
00:15:41,191 --> 00:15:42,924
<i>[Hakkai] Someone kill me...</i>

234
00:15:43,024 --> 00:15:46,657
I'm sorry, goodbye, Gonou.

235
00:15:51,557 --> 00:15:54,591
KANAN!

236
00:15:56,357 --> 00:16:01,557
[Chin] Did you kill my entire
clan or of revenge?

237
00:16:01,657 --> 00:16:02,791
Did you?

238
00:16:02,891 --> 00:16:09,091
Or was it some miss quided sense
of justice?

239
00:16:10,557 --> 00:16:15,557
I do not dislike your almost
admirable hypocrisy.

240
00:16:16,957 --> 00:16:23,657
But only your utter disgrace
and humiliation can comfort
my soul.

241
00:16:23,757 --> 00:16:25,624
Please not another word.

242
00:16:25,724 --> 00:16:28,657
You are boring me to death.

243
00:16:28,757 --> 00:16:33,457
Instead, how about I tell you
two of the three things that
I hate the most?

244
00:16:33,557 --> 00:16:35,691
Sure, that could be amusing.

245
00:16:35,791 --> 00:16:37,291
Psychos and worms!

246
00:16:37,391 --> 00:16:38,591
Scipture, repell!

247
00:16:45,657 --> 00:16:49,524
You know what? You really made
me angry.

248
00:16:50,757 --> 00:16:52,191
Who would have thought?

249
00:16:52,291 --> 00:16:54,324
And I'm usually so laided
back too.

250
00:16:56,024 --> 00:16:59,357
[Goku groans in pain]

251
00:16:59,457 --> 00:17:00,957
I hurt all over.

252
00:17:01,057 --> 00:17:05,491
I think I might have broken my
leg in the fall.

253
00:17:05,591 --> 00:17:10,791
Shit! Chin Yisou...
Who is this guy?

254
00:17:11,791 --> 00:17:14,857
<i>I've never had to run so</i>
<i>hard in my life.</i>

255
00:17:14,957 --> 00:17:18,557
<i>There's definitley something</i>
<i>going on between him</i>
<i>and Hakkai.</i>

256
00:17:22,657 --> 00:17:23,991
Hakuryu!

257
00:17:24,091 --> 00:17:27,324
Have you been looking for me
all this time?

258
00:17:27,424 --> 00:17:28,757
Good dragon!

259
00:17:28,857 --> 00:17:31,924
I'll never eat you, no matter
how hungry I get!

260
00:17:34,424 --> 00:17:36,091
Hakuryu?

261
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:39,657
You're right.

262
00:17:42,391 --> 00:17:46,957
You and I have got to find a way
out of this stinkin' place.

263
00:17:52,152 --> 00:17:54,318
So how are you feeling?

264
00:17:55,118 --> 00:17:58,618
Hakkai? Who's that?

265
00:17:58,718 --> 00:18:03,485
[Gojyo] Hey, get a grip! YOU are
Cho Hakkai!

266
00:18:03,585 --> 00:18:04,718
Yeah, you're right.

267
00:18:07,618 --> 00:18:10,618
Nice little trick you
have there.

268
00:18:12,152 --> 00:18:13,085
Bastard!

269
00:18:13,185 --> 00:18:15,018
[Chin] Again with the gun.

270
00:18:15,118 --> 00:18:19,818
Will you at least aim for the
chest this time?

271
00:18:22,618 --> 00:18:24,652
[Goku yells]

272
00:18:28,518 --> 00:18:30,518
Sorry I'm late.

273
00:18:30,618 --> 00:18:31,452
Goku!

274
00:18:31,552 --> 00:18:33,152
What took you so long?

275
00:18:33,252 --> 00:18:34,718
[Goku] Ah! Ow!

276
00:18:34,818 --> 00:18:37,618
Come on, give me a break!
My leg's broken!

277
00:18:37,718 --> 00:18:40,718
And I'm hungry too.
Ugh it's awful!

278
00:18:40,818 --> 00:18:42,018
[Goku's stomach growls]

279
00:18:42,118 --> 00:18:43,252
Oh yeah, that's him.

280
00:18:43,352 --> 00:18:46,852
There can be absolutely no doubt
about that.

281
00:18:46,952 --> 00:18:49,052
Hey there...

282
00:18:49,152 --> 00:18:51,052
You dumb, stupid monkey!

283
00:18:55,252 --> 00:18:57,352
What the hell was that for?!

284
00:18:57,452 --> 00:18:58,218
What?

285
00:18:58,318 --> 00:18:59,252
What? What do you mean "what?",

286
00:18:59,352 --> 00:19:00,452
you big mean dumbass!

287
00:19:00,552 --> 00:19:02,985
Why doesn't he just say he's
relieved to see him?

288
00:19:03,518 --> 00:19:05,252
[Chin laughs]

289
00:19:05,352 --> 00:19:10,118
Well look, my arm is
all shattered.

290
00:19:10,218 --> 00:19:13,252
Aw shit. Doesn't this guy
feel any pain?

291
00:19:13,352 --> 00:19:19,785
[Chin] Believe me, I'm enough
agony watching this sappy
little reunion.

292
00:19:19,885 --> 00:19:24,352
It actually makes the bile rise
in my stomach.

293
00:19:24,452 --> 00:19:26,918
So he finally shows himself.

294
00:19:27,018 --> 00:19:29,318
Sanzo, something isn't kosher.

295
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:32,485
He just doesn't seem like he's
alive to me.

296
00:19:32,585 --> 00:19:34,352
What are you getting at?

297
00:19:34,452 --> 00:19:40,052
I really walloped him, but
he acts like nothing's
wrong at all.

298
00:19:40,152 --> 00:19:43,752
[Goyjo] So, are you saying
he's some kind of ghost?

299
00:19:45,385 --> 00:19:46,785
<i>That's it!</i>

300
00:19:46,885 --> 00:19:48,052
<i>I remember!</i>

301
00:19:48,752 --> 00:19:50,418
<i>I saw him that night!</i>

302
00:19:52,418 --> 00:19:55,618
<i>I killed this man before.</i>
<i>I'm sure of it.</i>

303
00:19:55,752 --> 00:20:00,585
[Chin] That's enough getting to
know you.

304
00:20:00,685 --> 00:20:04,485
I gave this some thought,
as you can you see.

305
00:20:04,585 --> 00:20:10,385
[Chin] And I knew there was one
way that I could make you suffer
the most.

306
00:20:10,485 --> 00:20:14,485
That would be to make
your friends suffer
for your misdeeds.

307
00:20:14,585 --> 00:20:16,318
Hey! That's really low!

308
00:20:17,352 --> 00:20:19,718
Oh please, you flatter me.

309
00:20:22,218 --> 00:20:28,118
I admit, the red-haired one
and the golden-eyed boy have
been a real barrel of laughs.

310
00:20:28,252 --> 00:20:29,352
Stay sharp.

311
00:20:36,352 --> 00:20:41,785
Because next time he really is
going to lose some of his little
play buddies.

312
00:20:41,885 --> 00:20:43,385
You just try it.

313
00:22:24,585 --> 00:22:26,785
[Goku] "As long as there are
people who believe in me,"

314
00:22:26,885 --> 00:22:30,685
"I will carry on. And I will
never do anything to let
them down."

315
00:22:30,785 --> 00:22:32,418
That's what Hakkai says.

316
00:22:32,518 --> 00:22:36,452
So no matter what kinds of dirty
tricks Chin Yisou pulls out of
his sleeves,

317
00:22:36,552 --> 00:22:38,985
We can be sure Hakkai will
never betray us!

318
00:22:39,085 --> 00:22:41,152
Isn't that right, Sanzo?

319
00:22:41,252 --> 00:22:42,652
Sanzo?

320
00:22:42,785 --> 00:22:47,718
Oh well. Don't miss "Battle
Against Darkness" Next time
on Sayuki.
