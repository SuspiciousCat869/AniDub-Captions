00:36:59.504 --> 00:37:01.975
- I guess she's a hearty eater.
- We're having matsutake rice!

00:37:02.009 --> 00:37:04.279
[water flowing]

00:37:04.313 --> 00:37:06.885
- Wow! It's massive!

00:37:06.919 --> 00:37:07.887
Ow!

00:37:07.920 --> 00:37:08.822
[gasps]

00:37:09.991 --> 00:37:11.795
What is this?

00:37:11.828 --> 00:37:13.932
Hold on! It's a tooth!

00:37:15.134 --> 00:37:16.103
[sighs]

- [grunts]

00:37:19.376 --> 00:37:21.748
- [gasps]
That Mohawk-style haircut.

00:37:24.019 --> 00:37:28.127
Right. It's the guy
whose name I heard from Sumi.

00:37:28.160 --> 00:37:30.465
Genya Shinazugawa!

00:37:30.498 --> 00:37:31.467
- Huh?

00:37:31.501 --> 00:37:32.336
Die!

00:37:32.369 --> 00:37:34.339
- [shrieks]

00:37:36.244 --> 00:37:37.212

- [caws]

00:37:39.551 --> 00:37:41.087
- Huh?

00:37:41.120 --> 00:37:42.857
- How have you been?!

00:37:42.891 --> 00:37:44.092
I meant to ask!

00:37:44.126 --> 00:37:46.163
Are you and
the Wind Hashira related?!

00:37:46.197 --> 00:37:48.300
- [growls]
- [gurgles]

00:37:48.334 --> 00:37:52.075
- Stop trying to make
small talk with me, damn it!

00:37:52.108 --> 00:37:54.279
[insects chirping]

00:37:54.312 --> 00:37:56.150
- And here I thought
for a second

00:37:56.183 --> 00:37:57.754
we could bond
in our nakedness.

00:37:57.787 --> 00:37:58.655
[splashing]

00:37:58.688 --> 00:38:00.325
Making new friends
sure is tough.

00:38:00.358 --> 00:38:02.763
- [humming a tune]

00:38:04.568 --> 00:38:07.673
- [bird warbles]
- Wow, that's impressive!

00:38:07.707 --> 00:38:09.310
- You think so?

00:38:09.343 --> 00:38:11.814
But I really only nibbled,
to be honest.

00:38:11.848 --> 00:38:14.620
- I need to eat more
to get stronger!

00:38:14.654 --> 00:38:16.023
Oh, right.

00:38:16.056 --> 00:38:17.961
The guy you met
at the hot spring

00:38:17.994 --> 00:38:19.330
was Genya Shinazugawa.

00:38:19.363 --> 00:38:20.800
He's also a swordsman.

00:38:20.833 --> 00:38:23.605
- What?
Did you say, "Shinazugawa"?

00:38:23.638 --> 00:38:26.645
That would make him
the Wind Hashira's brother.

00:38:26.678 --> 00:38:28.916
But he didn't have
a younger brother.

00:38:28.949 --> 00:38:30.185
He insisted.

00:38:30.218 --> 00:38:32.188
Maybe they're on bad terms.

00:38:32.222 --> 00:38:33.893
How heart-wrenching.

00:38:33.926 --> 00:38:35.295
- You really think so?

00:38:35.328 --> 00:38:36.798
I wonder what happened.

00:38:36.832 --> 00:38:38.067
- [grunts]

00:38:38.100 --> 00:38:39.469
- [sighs]
- Hmm?

00:38:39.504 --> 00:38:42.276
What are you
trying to say, Nezuko?

00:38:42.309 --> 00:38:44.580
- [giggles]
- Oh, I see!

00:38:44.614 --> 00:38:46.685
I have four siblings
in my family,

00:38:46.718 --> 00:38:48.689
and we all get along
pretty well,

00:38:48.722 --> 00:38:50.726
so it's hard for me to fathom

00:38:50.759 --> 00:38:53.832
what the Shinazugawa brothers
could be going through.

00:38:53.865 --> 00:38:55.736
- Speaking of,
Genya still hasn't shown up.

00:38:55.769 --> 00:38:56.972
- Aren't you just the cutest?

00:38:57.005 --> 00:39:00.111
- I was hoping we could
at least have a talk.

00:39:00.144 --> 00:39:02.482
- I don't think
he's coming at all.

00:39:02.516 --> 00:39:06.390
I heard some of the villagers
say he never takes meals.

00:39:06.424 --> 00:39:09.130
He probably
brought food with him.

00:39:09.163 --> 00:39:10.866
- But what if he didn't?

00:39:10.900 --> 00:39:13.505
I'll bring him
some rice balls just in case.

00:39:13.538 --> 00:39:16.644
- [giggles] Good idea!
I'll come too!

00:39:18.414 --> 00:39:20.753
Can you keep a secret, Nezuko?

00:39:20.786 --> 00:39:21.554
- Hmm?

00:39:21.588 --> 00:39:22.890
- Believe it or not,

00:39:22.923 --> 00:39:24.426
I'm getting hungry again.

00:39:24.460 --> 00:39:27.232
It's probably
from smelling the rice balls.

00:39:27.265 --> 00:39:28.969
Don't tell anyone, okay?

00:39:29.003 --> 00:39:29.771
- [grunts]

00:39:29.804 --> 00:39:31.775
- [humming a tune]
- Ms. Kanroji,

00:39:31.809 --> 00:39:34.747
why'd you join
the Demon Slayer Corps?

00:39:34.780 --> 00:39:36.350
- Hmm? Oh, me?

00:39:36.384 --> 00:39:38.855
It's kind of embarrassing.

00:39:38.888 --> 00:39:40.392
I shouldn't say!

00:39:40.425 --> 00:39:41.695
Or should I?

00:39:41.728 --> 00:39:43.164
Okay, fine!

00:39:43.197 --> 00:39:45.268
I joined hoping to find a man,

00:39:45.302 --> 00:39:47.707
one I could spend forever with!

00:39:47.740 --> 00:39:49.410
I mean, any girl would prefer

00:39:49.443 --> 00:39:50.946
someone who's stronger
than her, right?

00:39:50.979 --> 00:39:52.550
After all, we want
to feel protected.

00:39:52.583 --> 00:39:53.685
You know what I mean?

00:39:53.719 --> 00:39:56.357
Or maybe it's hard
for a boy to understand.

00:39:56.390 --> 00:39:57.760
I knew Hashira were strong,

00:39:57.794 --> 00:39:59.631
so I thought one of them
would be perfect!

00:39:59.664 --> 00:40:03.103
That's why I worked my hardest
to become a Hashira myself!

00:40:05.810 --> 00:40:08.916
It looks like Genya isn't here.

00:40:08.949 --> 00:40:10.217
KAKUSHI: Lady Kanroji?

00:40:10.251 --> 00:40:11.521
- Hmm?
- Hmm?

00:40:11.554 --> 00:40:14.627
- I'm told they'll be done
honing your sword soon.

00:40:14.661 --> 00:40:16.496
They've requested
you come to the workshop

00:40:16.531 --> 00:40:19.069
to help make
the final adjustments.

00:40:19.102 --> 00:40:20.237
- Oh, dear.

00:40:20.271 --> 00:40:22.543
It looks like I have to go now.

00:40:22.576 --> 00:40:25.281
If you'd like,
we could take you.

00:40:25.314 --> 00:40:26.651
- That's all right.
- [coos]

00:40:26.685 --> 00:40:28.888
- I'll probably be leaving
in the middle of the night.

00:40:28.922 --> 00:40:30.358
- [groans]

00:40:30.391 --> 00:40:32.028
- Really? But...

00:40:32.062 --> 00:40:34.333
That makes sense.

00:40:34.366 --> 00:40:35.570
[sighs]

00:40:35.603 --> 00:40:37.540
- Thanks for offering.

00:40:37.573 --> 00:40:41.380
While we may not live
to see each other ever again,

00:40:41.413 --> 00:40:42.950
let's give it our all.

00:40:42.983 --> 00:40:47.325
Never forget you took on an
Upper Rank Demon and survived.

00:40:47.358 --> 00:40:49.564
That experience is priceless.

00:40:49.597 --> 00:40:51.367
Training is valuable,

00:40:51.400 --> 00:40:52.570
but nothing can ever top

00:40:52.603 --> 00:40:55.308
what you learn
from firsthand experience.

00:40:55.342 --> 00:40:56.812
I'd say what you
all went through

00:40:56.845 --> 00:40:58.782
is equal
to ten years of training.

00:40:58.816 --> 00:41:01.187
Whether you know it
or not, Tanjiro,

00:41:01.220 --> 00:41:04.460
you're far stronger
than you ever were before.

00:41:04.493 --> 00:41:05.595
- Hmm.

00:41:06.731 --> 00:41:08.434
- Good luck, you two!

00:41:08.467 --> 00:41:11.808
I'll be rooting for you
every step of the way!

00:41:11.841 --> 00:41:13.979
[laughs]

00:41:14.013 --> 00:41:16.383
[both coo]

00:41:16.417 --> 00:41:18.387
- Thank you, Ms. Kanroji!
- [grunts]

00:41:18.420 --> 00:41:20.692
- I've still got a ways to go.

00:41:20.725 --> 00:41:24.200
After all,
Mr. Uzui did everything.

00:41:24.233 --> 00:41:26.738
I'll work even harder

00:41:26.772 --> 00:41:30.111
to defeat Muzan Kibutsuji.

00:41:30.145 --> 00:41:31.246

- [gasps]

00:41:33.150 --> 00:41:36.223
- Say, Tanjiro,
you've been granted permission

00:41:36.256 --> 00:41:38.127
for a long stay, right?

00:41:38.160 --> 00:41:40.131
- Uh, yes, I have.

00:41:40.164 --> 00:41:41.834
- [swoons]
- [gasps]

00:41:44.907 --> 00:41:47.814
Well, apparently there's
a secret weapon in this village

00:41:47.847 --> 00:41:49.316
that will make you stronger.

00:41:49.349 --> 00:41:51.522
Try to find it, okay?

00:41:51.555 --> 00:41:54.059
- [sighs]
- Bye now!

00:41:54.093 --> 00:41:56.296
- [grunts]
- Ehh.

00:41:57.399 --> 00:41:59.469
- [groans]
- [gasps]

00:41:59.502 --> 00:42:01.607
[birds chirping]

00:42:03.011 --> 00:42:05.114
- [steady breathing]

00:42:11.026 --> 00:42:12.095
[sniffs]

00:42:12.128 --> 00:42:14.099
[sighs]

00:42:14.133 --> 00:42:16.537
Wow!

00:42:17.438 --> 00:42:19.844
This breakfast looks amazing!

00:42:19.878 --> 00:42:22.884
- The vegetables were all picked
on the mountainside here.

00:42:22.917 --> 00:42:26.290
And this fish was caught fresh
from the river this morning.

00:42:26.323 --> 00:42:27.626
- Really?

00:42:27.659 --> 00:42:30.666
- By the way, the chief
said he'll be contacting you

00:42:30.700 --> 00:42:32.970
as soon as they've found
Mr. Haganezuka.

00:42:33.003 --> 00:42:36.878
Until then, please build up
your stamina, and get some rest.

00:42:36.911 --> 00:42:39.115
- Right! Thank you so much!

00:42:40.218 --> 00:42:42.054
Thanks for the meal.

00:42:43.558 --> 00:42:44.660
- Hmm?

00:42:46.363 --> 00:42:48.468
- Nezuko, you listening?

00:42:48.501 --> 00:42:49.871
- Mm?

00:42:49.904 --> 00:42:52.475
- I know I should focus
on resting, but...

00:42:52.510 --> 00:42:54.346
I can't stop thinking about it,

00:42:54.379 --> 00:42:56.083
what Ms. Kanroji told me,

00:42:56.116 --> 00:42:58.354
how there's a secret weapon
in the village

00:42:58.387 --> 00:43:00.258
that can make you stronger.

00:43:00.292 --> 00:43:02.029
Want to look for it?

00:43:02.062 --> 00:43:03.130
- Mm!

00:43:03.164 --> 00:43:05.067
<i>[peaceful music playing]</i>

00:43:06.102 --> 00:43:08.542
- Wonder what kind
of weapon it is.

00:43:08.575 --> 00:43:10.278
- Mm.

00:43:10.311 --> 00:43:11.815
- Well, if it is a sword,

00:43:11.848 --> 00:43:13.685
maybe it's buried
in the ground!

00:43:13.718 --> 00:43:16.925
It feels like we're
on a treasure hunt, doesn't it?

00:43:16.958 --> 00:43:18.260
[winces]

00:43:18.294 --> 00:43:23.338
While I do enjoy being here,
the hot spring really reeks.

[winces]

00:43:25.241 --> 00:43:26.845
Or my sense of smell is off

00:43:26.878 --> 00:43:29.183
because I
haven't recovered yet.

00:43:29.216 --> 00:43:31.955
CHILD: Ask all you want.
I'm not giving it to you!

00:43:31.988 --> 00:43:32.856
- Eh?

00:43:32.890 --> 00:43:35.395
- I don't have time
to argue with you.

00:43:35.428 --> 00:43:38.669
I came here for it,
and I'm not leaving without it.

00:43:38.702 --> 00:43:41.908
- A kid? And is that...

00:43:41.941 --> 00:43:44.145
- I said no, you dummy!
- That's a Hashira, isn't it?

00:43:44.179 --> 00:43:45.047
- Now get lost!

00:43:45.081 --> 00:43:46.818
- What did Ms. Shinobu
say his name was?

00:43:46.851 --> 00:43:48.420
- I don't care
if you're a Hashira or not!

00:43:48.453 --> 00:43:49.456
You're annoying!

00:43:49.489 --> 00:43:50.959
- Oh, right.
- So just leave!

00:43:50.993 --> 00:43:55.334
- The Mist Hashira,
Muichiro Tokito!

00:43:55.368 --> 00:43:56.905
It is him.

00:43:56.938 --> 00:43:59.711
Just how many Hashira
are here?

00:43:59.744 --> 00:44:01.346
- Give me the key.

00:44:01.380 --> 00:44:02.950
- In your dreams!

00:44:02.984 --> 00:44:06.056
My ancestor made this,
and it's precious to me!

00:44:06.089 --> 00:44:07.994
- [gasps] Hold on.

00:44:08.027 --> 00:44:10.700
Is someone else behind him?

00:44:10.733 --> 00:44:11.935
- Didn't you hear me?

00:44:11.968 --> 00:44:13.805
I said I'm not giving it to you!

00:44:14.741 --> 00:44:16.544
- [gasps] There is.

00:44:16.577 --> 00:44:19.416
But who is it?

00:44:19.449 --> 00:44:20.952
Do I know him?

00:44:20.986 --> 00:44:23.692
<i>[dramatic music playing]</i>

00:44:23.725 --> 00:44:26.697
[gasps] I do.

00:44:26.731 --> 00:44:28.367
I've seen that man before.

00:44:35.949 --> 00:44:38.353
<i>["Kizuna no Kiseki" playing]</i>

[page flutters]

00:48:37.566 --> 00:48:40.539
- Thank goodness
you finally woke up, Tanjiro.

00:48:40.572 --> 00:48:42.074
GIRLS: Thank goodness!

00:48:42.108 --> 00:48:43.912
- Thanks, everybody!

00:48:43.945 --> 00:48:45.849
- Concerning Mr. Inosuke,

00:48:45.883 --> 00:48:48.521
how long do you think
he was on the ceiling?

00:48:48.555 --> 00:48:50.124
- Hmm...
- Hmm...

00:48:50.157 --> 00:48:53.129
<i>- [film rewinds]</i>
- Hmm.

00:48:53.163 --> 00:48:56.103
- So that means he had
to have been stuck up there

00:48:56.136 --> 00:48:57.906
for at least an hour.

00:48:57.939 --> 00:49:00.545
He's as reckless as ever,
isn't he?

00:49:00.579 --> 00:49:01.914
- Mm-hmm!
- Mm-hmm.

00:49:01.948 --> 00:49:03.383
- INOSUKE: Wrong!

00:49:05.087 --> 00:49:06.456
- What do you mean I'm wrong?!

00:49:06.490 --> 00:49:09.328
- I was hiding up there
since yesterday!

00:49:09.362 --> 00:49:10.666
- What?!
- What?!

00:49:10.699 --> 00:49:11.868
- [chuckles]

00:49:11.901 --> 00:49:12.870
Rustle, rustle, rustle.

00:49:12.903 --> 00:49:13.905
Wake up!

00:49:13.939 --> 00:49:15.876
Come on, and wake up,
Kanpachiro!

00:49:15.909 --> 00:49:17.679
Open your eyes, already!

00:49:17.712 --> 00:49:19.817
How long are you gonna sleep?!

00:49:19.850 --> 00:49:21.754
- That's what
you were doing up there?

00:49:21.787 --> 00:49:25.695
- I guess that means Tanjiro
had no choice but to wake up.

00:49:25.729 --> 00:49:27.098
- I guess so.
- I guess so.

00:49:27.131 --> 00:49:28.869
- Thanks to me, he's awake!

00:49:28.902 --> 00:49:30.905
- That's right!
Thanks, Inosuke.

I'm going to give it my all.

00:49:37.385 --> 00:49:38.387
You have my word!

00:49:38.420 --> 00:49:40.725
- Don't even think
about making me worry!
