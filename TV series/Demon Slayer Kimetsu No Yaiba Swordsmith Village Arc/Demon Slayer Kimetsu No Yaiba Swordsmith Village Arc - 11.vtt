- Try it over there.
- That's all right.

00:43:05.569 --> 00:43:06.971
- This way.
- No, no, bring that...

00:43:07.005 --> 00:43:09.677
- Yes.
- That should look perfect.

00:43:10.846 --> 00:43:13.384
- More. Further.
- Okay.

00:43:13.417 --> 00:43:15.254
- Let me see.
- Almost there.

00:43:15.287 --> 00:43:16.389
- Over there.

00:43:17.392 --> 00:43:19.564
- Hey, Lord Tecchin!

00:43:19.597 --> 00:43:22.068
- Ah, Kotetsu!

00:43:22.101 --> 00:43:24.741
- Mr. Tanjiro's
leaving the village,

00:43:24.774 --> 00:43:26.878
so he'd like to say goodbye.

00:43:30.051 --> 00:43:31.721
Mr. Tanjiro?

00:43:38.133 --> 00:43:40.506
[Tecchin] Feeling any better
after resting?

00:43:40.539 --> 00:43:43.778
- Yes. Thank you
for all that you did for me.

00:43:43.812 --> 00:43:45.047
I'm also grateful

00:43:45.081 --> 00:43:47.151
that you provided me
with this cart as well.

00:43:47.185 --> 00:43:50.625
- Please, I should be
the one who's thanking you.

00:43:50.659 --> 00:43:53.497
You did a stupendous job
protecting this village!

00:43:53.532 --> 00:43:54.900
I'm in your debt.

00:43:54.934 --> 00:43:58.875
- I wasn't able to do
that much all on my own.

00:43:58.908 --> 00:44:01.113
The others helped more.

00:44:01.146 --> 00:44:02.616
Our combined strength

00:44:02.649 --> 00:44:05.355
and that sword which
connects us to ancient hope,

00:44:05.388 --> 00:44:09.697
that is the reason we were able
to beat those Upper Rank demons.

00:44:09.731 --> 00:44:13.303
- Yes, yes, you're quite right.

00:44:13.337 --> 00:44:15.742
And where's your little sister?

00:44:16.645 --> 00:44:18.381
- She's asleep.

00:44:18.414 --> 00:44:20.418
Her body's
got to be exhausted.

00:44:20.452 --> 00:44:22.455
- [breathing softly]

00:44:26.698 --> 00:44:28.201
- [chuckles]

00:44:28.234 --> 00:44:29.269
- I see!

00:44:29.302 --> 00:44:32.308
Well, I'm truly glad
to hear she's all right!

00:44:33.444 --> 00:44:34.980
- Yes!

00:44:36.216 --> 00:44:37.252
- Eh?

00:44:37.285 --> 00:44:39.657
- [murmurs]

00:44:39.690 --> 00:44:41.895
- Kanamori, is it me,

00:44:41.928 --> 00:44:45.201
or is that Hotaru
lurking around over there?

00:44:45.234 --> 00:44:46.269
- It's him.

00:44:46.303 --> 00:44:47.974
- What is he doing?

00:44:48.007 --> 00:44:50.846
- I guess he's still upset,
so he's trying to hide.

00:44:50.879 --> 00:44:52.315
He won't forgive Mr. Tanjiro

00:44:52.348 --> 00:44:54.987
for using a sword
before it was fully honed.

00:44:55.021 --> 00:44:56.290
- [groans]

00:44:56.323 --> 00:44:59.062
[Tecchin] What am I
going to do with that guy?

00:44:59.095 --> 00:45:01.701
Hotaru, come over here a second!

00:45:01.734 --> 00:45:03.070
- [grumbling]

00:45:04.072 --> 00:45:07.078

[Tecchin] Hotaru!

00:45:14.159 --> 00:45:16.330
- I'm telling you,
it's all his fault.

00:45:16.363 --> 00:45:18.033
- Agh! Ouch!

00:45:18.066 --> 00:45:20.772
- Right? Am I right?
Am I right?!

00:45:20.806 --> 00:45:23.544
- Hey! Come on, hey!
- Sorry but that really hurts!

00:45:23.578 --> 00:45:24.547
[Tecchin] Hotaru!

00:45:24.581 --> 00:45:26.650
- But wait, if Mr. Tanjiro

00:45:26.684 --> 00:45:28.220
and the others
hadn't come to help,

00:45:28.254 --> 00:45:30.157
the village
would have been destroyed!

00:45:30.190 --> 00:45:32.295
- Ow. Ow!

00:45:32.328 --> 00:45:33.297

00:45:33.330 --> 00:45:35.167
- Ow, ow, ow.

00:45:35.200 --> 00:45:36.436
- Now, Hotaru...

00:45:36.470 --> 00:45:40.244
the real reason you came here
was to greet Tanjiro, wasn't it?

00:45:40.277 --> 00:45:43.417
He came all the way here
to speak to you.

00:45:43.450 --> 00:45:45.087
- [grumbles]

00:45:46.457 --> 00:45:50.599

always taking care of my sword!

00:45:50.632 --> 00:45:52.235
I appreciate it.

00:45:52.268 --> 00:45:56.476
The reason that I came here
was to thank you for doing that.

00:45:58.047 --> 00:46:01.921
- I-I'll begin honing
your sword for you right away.

00:46:01.954 --> 00:46:03.825
Stand by
at the Butterfly Mansion.

00:46:03.859 --> 00:46:06.096
- You're going
to repair it for me?

00:46:06.130 --> 00:46:08.836
- Of course I am.
Don't you want it fixed?

00:46:08.869 --> 00:46:10.371
- Thank you very much!

00:46:10.404 --> 00:46:12.810
- Eh, sure.

00:46:12.843 --> 00:46:16.584
- Mr. Haganezuka, don't tell me
you're embarrassed.

That's pretty funny, huh?

Now I have to get back
to training again!

00:46:48.314 --> 00:46:50.218
Safe travels, Kakushi.

I'm counting on you
to get him there.

Just as you did coming here.

You'll have
to put these on again.
