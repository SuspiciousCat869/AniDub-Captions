[IZUKU]
Hero work studies.

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:15.265 position:50% align:center
Experience-oriented
off-campus programs

00:00:15.348 --> 00:00:17.100 position:50% align:center
that allow students
in the hero course

00:00:17.183 --> 00:00:18.601 position:50% align:center
who have provisional licenses

00:00:18.685 --> 00:00:22.230 position:50% align:center
to work with pros
at their agencies.

00:00:22.313 --> 00:00:24.482 position:50% align:center
Now that I have my
provisional license,

00:00:24.566 --> 00:00:25.942 position:50% align:center
things will be different
than they were

00:00:26.026 --> 00:00:28.028 position:50% align:center
in my previous internship,
when I fought

00:00:28.111 --> 00:00:30.321 position:50% align:center
against Hero Killer Stain.

00:00:30.405 --> 00:00:32.615 position:50% align:center
I'll be able to use my
Quirk under the guidance

00:00:32.699 --> 00:00:35.827 position:50% align:center
of a pro, and I can even be
dispatched to fight villains

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.580 position:50% align:center
and help out at disaster areas.

00:00:38.663 --> 00:00:40.373 position:50% align:center
If my work study goes well,

00:00:40.457 --> 00:00:42.375 position:50% align:center
I could be invited by
the hero I work with

00:00:42.459 --> 00:00:43.877 position:50% align:center
to be their sidekick.

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.504 position:50% align:center
I might even be scouted
by famous pro heroes,

00:00:46.588 --> 00:00:49.841 position:50% align:center
who are always on the
lookout for new talent.

00:00:49.924 --> 00:00:52.385 position:50% align:center
Encouraged by Mirio
Togata, a member

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.430 position:50% align:center
of UA's Big Three,
I decided to try my luck

00:00:55.513 --> 00:00:57.932 position:50% align:center
with the agency of
All Might's former sidekick,

00:00:58.016 --> 00:01:00.226 position:50% align:center
Sir Nighteye.

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:03.271 position:50% align:center
But getting in won't be easy.

00:01:03.355 --> 00:01:04.814 position:50% align:center
If you wanna be
acknowledged by him,

00:01:04.898 --> 00:01:06.483 position:50% align:center
here's a little tip.

00:01:06.566 --> 00:01:09.152 position:50% align:center
You need to do one important
thing at this meeting.

00:01:09.235 --> 00:01:10.403 position:50% align:center
Make him laugh.

00:01:10.487 --> 00:01:12.238 position:50% align:center
Then he'll totally
approve of you.

00:01:14.115 --> 00:01:17.535 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] He wants to
laugh? I can do that.

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:20.330 position:50% align:center
In order to become
the number-one hero!

00:01:20.413 --> 00:01:22.540 position:50% align:center
I'm Izuku Midoriya.

00:01:23.583 --> 00:01:25.710 position:50% align:center
What is this, boy?

00:01:25.794 --> 00:01:28.046 position:50% align:center
Are you ridiculing All Might?

00:01:30.006 --> 00:01:32.050 position:50% align:center
No!

00:01:32.133 --> 00:01:33.510 position:50% align:center
[MIRIO]
He's not funny!

00:03:04.893 --> 00:03:08.229 position:50% align:center
The nerve.

00:03:08.313 --> 00:03:10.815 position:50% align:center
What are you doing
with your face?

00:03:11.941 --> 00:03:13.651 position:50% align:center
Is this a joke to you?

00:03:13.735 --> 00:03:15.737 position:50% align:center
Uh. No, I guess not?

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:17.906 position:50% align:center
You attempted this
blasphemous excuse

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:21.534 position:50% align:center
of an impression on
All Might's former sidekick?

00:03:21.618 --> 00:03:23.661 position:50% align:center
All Might's wrinkles
aren't like this at all.

00:03:23.745 --> 00:03:25.497 position:50% align:center
You fool.

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:27.165 position:50% align:center
[SIR NIGHTEYE] In his
early days, his crows' feet

00:03:27.248 --> 00:03:29.668 position:50% align:center
were 0.6 centimeters long.

00:03:29.751 --> 00:03:33.004 position:50% align:center
From the Silver Age
on they were 0.8.

00:03:33.088 --> 00:03:35.048 position:50% align:center
These days, even
unlicensed merchandise

00:03:35.131 --> 00:03:38.885 position:50% align:center
manages to have the correct
wrinkles in the correct era.

00:03:38.968 --> 00:03:40.970 position:50% align:center
But you don't even
know that much?

00:03:41.054 --> 00:03:42.055 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU gasps]

00:03:42.138 --> 00:03:43.515 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Every corner of his office

00:03:43.598 --> 00:03:45.934 position:50% align:center
is filled with All Might gear!

00:03:46.017 --> 00:03:47.018 position:50% align:center
Ah!

00:03:47.102 --> 00:03:48.353 position:50% align:center
The tenth anniversary poster

00:03:48.436 --> 00:03:52.232 position:50% align:center
that was never on sale
for the public! I want it!

00:03:52.315 --> 00:03:54.526 position:50% align:center
There's no other way to put it.

00:03:54.609 --> 00:03:58.071 position:50% align:center
This man is definitely a
serious All Might fanboy!

00:03:58.154 --> 00:04:00.031 position:50% align:center
I don't care for this one bit.

00:04:00.115 --> 00:04:01.324 position:50% align:center
You can see yourself out.

00:04:01.408 --> 00:04:04.077 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
The vinegar river incident.

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:06.121 position:50% align:center
Are you not aware of it, sir?

00:04:07.831 --> 00:04:10.125 position:50% align:center
Help me! Anyone!

00:04:10.208 --> 00:04:11.793 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] A middle schooler
whose Quirk allowed him

00:04:11.876 --> 00:04:13.211 position:50% align:center
to change the
properties of water

00:04:13.294 --> 00:04:14.754 position:50% align:center
was drowning in a river.

00:04:14.838 --> 00:04:17.757 position:50% align:center
But All Might stepped
in and saved him.

00:04:17.841 --> 00:04:21.261 position:50% align:center
[ALL MIGHT] It's fine now!
Do you know why?

00:04:21.344 --> 00:04:23.096 position:50% align:center
Because I am here!

00:04:23.179 --> 00:04:24.347 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
The drowning kid panicked

00:04:24.431 --> 00:04:26.850 position:50% align:center
and accidentally turned
the river into vinegar.

00:04:26.933 --> 00:04:29.811 position:50% align:center
Which, obviously, ended up
getting in All Might's eyes.

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:31.938 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] His face looked
slightly different

00:04:32.022 --> 00:04:33.189 position:50% align:center
from normal after.

00:04:33.273 --> 00:04:34.774 position:50% align:center
[ALL MIGHT]
Dang, this stings.

00:04:34.858 --> 00:04:36.985 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
That smile. Those narrowed eyes.

00:04:37.068 --> 00:04:40.030 position:50% align:center
That's the look I chose
to impersonate earlier.

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:44.034 position:50% align:center
I know this rescue.

00:04:44.117 --> 00:04:46.745 position:50% align:center
Although it took place
before I teamed up with him.

00:04:46.828 --> 00:04:48.371 position:50% align:center
And I believe they
mentioned it briefly

00:04:48.455 --> 00:04:50.540 position:50% align:center
on the widely-run
television special entitled

00:04:50.623 --> 00:04:51.499 position:50% align:center
<i>A Look Back</i> .

00:04:51.583 --> 00:04:52.792 position:50% align:center
Yes, I love that show!

00:04:52.876 --> 00:04:54.169 position:50% align:center
I know there weren't
any villains involved,

00:04:54.252 --> 00:04:56.046 position:50% align:center
so some people think
it was a boring save.

00:04:56.129 --> 00:04:58.048 position:50% align:center
I'm sure that's why the fans
don't talk about it much,

00:04:58.131 --> 00:04:59.883 position:50% align:center
but I really like it
for some reason!

00:04:59.966 --> 00:05:01.718 position:50% align:center
Honestly, I think the best
part of the whole thing

00:05:01.801 --> 00:05:02.927 position:50% align:center
is the witty response he gave

00:05:03.011 --> 00:05:04.971 position:50% align:center
after being thanked
by the kid he rescued!

00:05:05.055 --> 00:05:06.723 position:50% align:center
[MIDDLE SCHOOLER 66A]
I can't thank you enough!

00:05:06.806 --> 00:05:08.808 position:50% align:center
I'm the one who should
be thanking you.

00:05:08.892 --> 00:05:10.810 position:50% align:center
"My skin feels
ten years younger."

00:05:10.894 --> 00:05:13.813 position:50% align:center
That's it! It was the
perfect one-liner!

00:05:13.897 --> 00:05:16.358 position:50% align:center
Now I see. You were
just testing me.

00:05:16.441 --> 00:05:17.859 position:50% align:center
What? Oh, no!

00:05:17.942 --> 00:05:19.736 position:50% align:center
It's just that, since All Might
is a teacher at my school,

00:05:19.819 --> 00:05:22.030 position:50% align:center
I never really get a chance
to geek out about him.

00:05:22.113 --> 00:05:25.325 position:50% align:center
I maybe got a little excited.

00:05:25.408 --> 00:05:26.534 position:50% align:center
As I recall, it turned out

00:05:26.618 --> 00:05:28.828 position:50% align:center
the child's volatile
home life was to blame.

00:05:28.912 --> 00:05:30.080 position:50% align:center
That's right!

00:05:30.163 --> 00:05:31.414 position:50% align:center
And that made All Might's
actions and words

00:05:31.498 --> 00:05:34.417 position:50% align:center
carry even more weight, I bet!

00:05:34.501 --> 00:05:37.337 position:50% align:center
Mirio. Who's that? He's loud.

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:39.297 position:50% align:center
An underclassman at my school.

00:05:39.381 --> 00:05:41.299 position:50% align:center
[MIRIO] He totally failed
to make Sir laugh.

00:05:41.383 --> 00:05:42.592 position:50% align:center
Like, massively.

00:05:42.676 --> 00:05:44.469 position:50% align:center
But, I gotta say,
I think he's still

00:05:44.552 --> 00:05:46.429 position:50% align:center
making a good first impression.

00:05:52.018 --> 00:05:53.812 position:50% align:center
[SIR NIGHTEYE]
Interesting.

00:05:53.895 --> 00:05:55.605 position:50% align:center
You want to do a work study here

00:05:55.689 --> 00:05:58.108 position:50% align:center
because you think that doing
so will make you stronger.

00:05:58.191 --> 00:05:59.901 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Yes, sir! Please let me!

00:05:59.984 --> 00:06:01.361 position:50% align:center
We'd need to draw up a contract.

00:06:01.444 --> 00:06:03.029 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Of course! Yes! I brought one.

00:06:03.113 --> 00:06:05.657 position:50% align:center
You will not interrupt me
while I'm speaking to you.

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:06.866 position:50% align:center
Sorry. sir!

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:08.284 position:50% align:center
[SIR NIGHTEYE]
Once I stamp this document,

00:06:08.368 --> 00:06:10.662 position:50% align:center
you'll officially be
contracted with my agency

00:06:10.745 --> 00:06:11.705 position:50% align:center
for a work study.

00:06:11.788 --> 00:06:13.039 position:50% align:center
Yes, sir!

00:06:13.123 --> 00:06:14.416 position:50% align:center
[SIR NIGHTEYE]
You have to understand that this

00:06:14.499 --> 00:06:16.751 position:50% align:center
will be nothing like
the week-long internships

00:06:16.835 --> 00:06:19.671 position:50% align:center
that you students
take on so casually.

00:06:19.754 --> 00:06:21.089 position:50% align:center
You must work here
for a minimum

00:06:21.172 --> 00:06:23.299 position:50% align:center
of four months and
will be paid wages.

00:06:23.383 --> 00:06:25.218 position:50% align:center
However, your
academic responsibilities

00:06:25.301 --> 00:06:28.096 position:50% align:center
will likely suffer due to
absences you'll rack up.

00:06:28.179 --> 00:06:30.640 position:50% align:center
Which means your classmates
will pull ahead of you.

00:06:30.724 --> 00:06:33.476 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
I understand that. But...

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:35.770 position:50% align:center
If I worry about what
everyone else is doing,

00:06:35.854 --> 00:06:37.897 position:50% align:center
I'll never be number one.

00:06:46.823 --> 00:06:50.618 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Um. I think you missed.

00:06:50.702 --> 00:06:52.287 position:50% align:center
Because I am not approving this.

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:53.538 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
What?

00:06:53.621 --> 00:06:54.664 position:50% align:center
[SIR NIGHTEYE]
I understand how working here

00:06:54.748 --> 00:06:56.249 position:50% align:center
would be beneficial to you.

00:06:56.332 --> 00:06:59.586 position:50% align:center
But what benefit would
you bring to my agency?

00:06:59.669 --> 00:07:01.838 position:50% align:center
This office currently
runs smoothly,

00:07:01.921 --> 00:07:04.215 position:50% align:center
with two sidekicks and
one work study student

00:07:04.299 --> 00:07:06.092 position:50% align:center
already under my employ.

00:07:06.176 --> 00:07:08.345 position:50% align:center
So why would I add you on?

00:07:08.428 --> 00:07:11.014 position:50% align:center
How can you
contribute to society?

00:07:11.097 --> 00:07:13.224 position:50% align:center
How can you be useful to others?

00:07:13.308 --> 00:07:15.226 position:50% align:center
In order to be acknowledged,
you must be able

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:18.605 position:50% align:center
to answer those
questions unequivocally.

00:07:18.688 --> 00:07:22.067 position:50% align:center
All Might showed his worth
using power and humor.

00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:25.362 position:50% align:center
He gave hope to those who
lived in fear of criminals.

00:07:25.445 --> 00:07:29.115 position:50% align:center
That's why the people were
happy to acknowledge him.

00:07:29.199 --> 00:07:30.492 position:50% align:center
You're right.

00:07:30.575 --> 00:07:33.328 position:50% align:center
I need to find out how
I can help the world.

00:07:35.372 --> 00:07:36.456 position:50% align:center
[SIR NIGHTEYE]
It's time to show me

00:07:36.539 --> 00:07:38.792 position:50% align:center
what you would
bring to the table.

00:07:38.875 --> 00:07:42.003 position:50% align:center
Using actions, not words.

00:07:42.087 --> 00:07:43.546 position:50% align:center
Three minutes.

00:07:43.630 --> 00:07:47.133 position:50% align:center
You have three minutes to try
and take this seal from me.

00:07:47.217 --> 00:07:48.593 position:50% align:center
If you want to work as a hero

00:07:48.677 --> 00:07:52.847 position:50% align:center
under my guidance, then stamp
that contract yourself.

00:07:52.931 --> 00:07:54.474 position:50% align:center
Wait. What?

00:07:54.557 --> 00:07:56.309 position:50% align:center
[SIR NIGHTEYE] I'm saying
that even though you don't

00:07:56.393 --> 00:07:58.687 position:50% align:center
appear to possess a
single ounce of humor

00:07:58.770 --> 00:08:02.399 position:50% align:center
in your body, I'm still
giving you a chance.

00:08:02.482 --> 00:08:04.401 position:50% align:center
The two of you, go wait outside.

00:08:04.484 --> 00:08:05.485 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
Sir. Yes, sir!

00:08:05.568 --> 00:08:06.611 position:50% align:center
[SIR NIGHTEYE]
Once more, with feeling.

00:08:06.695 --> 00:08:08.238 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
Yes, sir!

00:08:10.907 --> 00:08:12.409 position:50% align:center
[BUBBLE GIRL]
So, did you have to do

00:08:12.492 --> 00:08:13.910 position:50% align:center
a practical interview like that?

00:08:13.993 --> 00:08:15.704 position:50% align:center
Nah, Sir asked for
me specifically,

00:08:15.787 --> 00:08:17.831 position:50% align:center
so I didn't have to jump
through hoops or anything.

00:08:17.914 --> 00:08:19.874 position:50% align:center
Jeez, you really
are his golden boy.

00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:21.167 position:50% align:center
--Must be nice.
--[MIRIO] Aw--

00:08:21.251 --> 00:08:22.377 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:23.503 position:50% align:center
[BUBBLE GIRL]
I can't believe I'm jealous

00:08:23.586 --> 00:08:25.213 position:50% align:center
of a high-school kid, ugh.

00:08:25.296 --> 00:08:27.757 position:50% align:center
[MIRIO]
Oh, man.

00:08:27.841 --> 00:08:30.844 position:50% align:center
[MIRIO] Whoo. This doesn't
sound great for Midoriya.

00:08:30.927 --> 00:08:33.847 position:50% align:center
His future just
started lookin' dark.

00:08:33.930 --> 00:08:36.474 position:50% align:center
Up against Sir's Quirk,
the odds are grim.

00:08:36.558 --> 00:08:39.394 position:50% align:center
It's gonna be basically
impossible to snatch that stamp.

00:08:39.477 --> 00:08:40.729 position:50% align:center
Or even get close.

00:08:40.812 --> 00:08:43.106 position:50% align:center
I'll take no offensive
measures during this time,

00:08:43.189 --> 00:08:46.067 position:50% align:center
and you're welcome to attack me
in any manner you desire.

00:08:46.151 --> 00:08:49.571 position:50% align:center
Don't concern yourself with
what happens to the room.

00:08:49.654 --> 00:08:51.364 position:50% align:center
Just come and get it.

00:08:51.448 --> 00:08:53.575 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Nighteye's Quirk is... No.

00:08:53.658 --> 00:08:57.537 position:50% align:center
It's no time to strategize.
I've just got to get that seal.

00:08:57.620 --> 00:09:01.833 position:50% align:center
I'll forge my own path
to the number-one spot!

00:09:01.916 --> 00:09:05.253 position:50% align:center
One For All. Full Cowling!

00:09:05.337 --> 00:09:06.796 position:50% align:center
An approach from the front,

00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:09.591 position:50% align:center
but it's merely a feint
and a failed grab.

00:09:09.674 --> 00:09:11.009 position:50% align:center
And then another jump attack,

00:09:11.092 --> 00:09:13.553 position:50% align:center
to no avail.
I can see everything.

00:09:13.636 --> 00:09:15.221 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
I knew it!

00:09:15.305 --> 00:09:18.391 position:50% align:center
Still. Maybe if I just
keep trying moves...

00:09:26.649 --> 00:09:29.861 position:50% align:center
Is that all you've got?

00:09:29.944 --> 00:09:32.864 position:50% align:center
I thought you were attempting
to show me your usefulness.

00:09:32.947 --> 00:09:34.908 position:50% align:center
This is a waste of time.

00:09:34.991 --> 00:09:36.659 position:50% align:center
[beeps]

00:09:36.743 --> 00:09:38.661 position:50% align:center
He's really stringing
that kid along.

00:09:38.745 --> 00:09:40.705 position:50% align:center
I know, right?

00:09:40.789 --> 00:09:42.665 position:50% align:center
[MIRIO] I can tell from the
noises coming out of the office

00:09:42.749 --> 00:09:44.668 position:50% align:center
that Sir is being serious.

00:09:44.751 --> 00:09:47.712 position:50% align:center
Is he really not going
to accept Midoriya?

00:09:49.631 --> 00:09:54.302 position:50% align:center
[SIR NIGHTEYE] One minute
passes. He backs up briefly.

00:09:54.386 --> 00:09:56.513 position:50% align:center
And appears nervous.

00:09:56.596 --> 00:10:00.558 position:50% align:center
Finally understanding that he
can't overcome my Foresight.

00:10:01.559 --> 00:10:04.396 position:50% align:center
[PRESENT MIC] Sir Nighteye!
His Quirk: Foresight!

00:10:04.479 --> 00:10:06.064 position:50% align:center
After touching someone
and locking eyes

00:10:06.147 --> 00:10:08.108 position:50% align:center
with them, he has the
power for the next hour

00:10:08.191 --> 00:10:10.068 position:50% align:center
to see the choices
that person will make!

00:10:10.151 --> 00:10:12.237 position:50% align:center
It's like he knows
their every move!

00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:14.948 position:50% align:center
[SIR NIGHTEYE] The activation
requirements are secret.

00:10:15.031 --> 00:10:17.575 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] It doesn't matter how
many different moves I try.

00:10:17.659 --> 00:10:19.119 position:50% align:center
He's one step ahead!

00:10:19.202 --> 00:10:22.622 position:50% align:center
There's gotta be a way
to slip past his Quirk.

00:10:22.706 --> 00:10:24.666 position:50% align:center
[SIR NIGHTEYE] I had high
expectations for you.

00:10:24.749 --> 00:10:26.126 position:50% align:center
Until now.

00:10:26.209 --> 00:10:27.585 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU gasps]

00:10:27.669 --> 00:10:29.337 position:50% align:center
[SIR NIGHTEYE] You have the
power to become a symbol,

00:10:29.421 --> 00:10:30.839 position:50% align:center
but you're mediocre.

00:10:30.922 --> 00:10:32.507 position:50% align:center
Meanwhile, villains everywhere

00:10:32.590 --> 00:10:35.802 position:50% align:center
are getting restless, and
gloom is creeping closer.

00:10:35.885 --> 00:10:38.555 position:50% align:center
A pity. All Might
chose wrong after all.

00:10:38.638 --> 00:10:40.807 position:50% align:center
Mirio should have
inherited the power.

00:10:40.890 --> 00:10:42.976 position:50% align:center
What are you talking about?

00:10:43.059 --> 00:10:45.103 position:50% align:center
"Chose wrong after all"?

00:10:47.147 --> 00:10:50.608 position:50% align:center
Don't get me wrong, I do
love and respect All Might.

00:10:50.692 --> 00:10:53.319 position:50% align:center
But I don't understand
why he chose you.

00:10:53.403 --> 00:10:55.572 position:50% align:center
How can you succeed him?

00:10:55.655 --> 00:10:58.116 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] I guess I never
really thought about it,

00:10:58.199 --> 00:11:00.702 position:50% align:center
but of course there were
candidates before me.

00:11:00.785 --> 00:11:02.245 position:50% align:center
Which means Togata
was in the running

00:11:02.328 --> 00:11:06.082 position:50% align:center
to inherit One for All.
Does he know that?

00:11:06.166 --> 00:11:08.835 position:50% align:center
How did Nighteye and
All Might choose him?

00:11:08.918 --> 00:11:11.338 position:50% align:center
Or does All Might even
know about any of this.

00:11:11.421 --> 00:11:14.257 position:50% align:center
And if so, why didn't
he tell me before?

00:11:14.341 --> 00:11:16.801 position:50% align:center
You think you have time
to stand there frozen?

00:11:16.885 --> 00:11:21.014 position:50% align:center
Or are you just getting tired,
running out of ideas.

00:11:21.097 --> 00:11:23.183 position:50% align:center
I was honestly a bit
curious when Mirio

00:11:23.266 --> 00:11:24.768 position:50% align:center
told me he was going
to bring you here

00:11:24.851 --> 00:11:26.227 position:50% align:center
to introduce you.

00:11:26.311 --> 00:11:28.980 position:50% align:center
But it turns out it
was a waste of time.

00:11:29.064 --> 00:11:31.274 position:50% align:center
There is a candidate
who is far worthier

00:11:31.358 --> 00:11:33.693 position:50% align:center
of inheriting
One For All than you.

00:11:33.777 --> 00:11:37.030 position:50% align:center
As such, I cannot
acknowledge you.

00:11:37.113 --> 00:11:40.033 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] I have to remember
the words he said that day.

00:11:40.116 --> 00:11:43.620 position:50% align:center
Young man. You, too,
can become a hero.

00:11:43.703 --> 00:11:45.580 position:50% align:center
I can give you my abilities.

00:11:45.663 --> 00:11:47.332 position:50% align:center
Take the torch.

00:11:48.583 --> 00:11:51.127 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
I have to keep fighting.

00:11:51.211 --> 00:11:53.380 position:50% align:center
I'll go beyond,
so he can't react

00:11:53.463 --> 00:11:56.216 position:50% align:center
even if he can
foresee my movements.

00:11:56.299 --> 00:11:59.594 position:50% align:center
I can't just let him
reject me now.

00:11:59.678 --> 00:12:01.221 position:50% align:center
Not after everything
All Might and I

00:12:01.304 --> 00:12:03.390 position:50% align:center
have been through!

00:12:03.473 --> 00:12:05.141 position:50% align:center
He chose me.

00:12:05.225 --> 00:12:07.727 position:50% align:center
He wanted me to have his power.

00:12:08.853 --> 00:12:13.108 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] I'm going to take
that stamp from you.

00:12:13.191 --> 00:12:16.486 position:50% align:center
I swear. I will make
you acknowledge me.

00:12:25.829 --> 00:12:27.622 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Nighteye's Quirk, Foresight,

00:12:27.706 --> 00:12:29.457 position:50% align:center
lets him see into the future.

00:12:29.541 --> 00:12:32.961 position:50% align:center
But the question is,
how far into the future?

00:12:33.044 --> 00:12:34.963 position:50% align:center
My best bet is to make
a ton of different moves

00:12:35.046 --> 00:12:38.008 position:50% align:center
as quickly as I can so he
won't have any time to think.

00:12:39.551 --> 00:12:41.594 position:50% align:center
There is a candidate
who is far worthier

00:12:41.678 --> 00:12:43.888 position:50% align:center
of inheriting
One For All than you.

00:12:43.972 --> 00:12:46.975 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] If I leave now, it's
like admitting he was right!

00:12:48.309 --> 00:12:50.061 position:50% align:center
[SIR NIGHTEYE]
Gran Torino's style.

00:12:50.145 --> 00:12:52.230 position:50% align:center
But you're a mere
shadow of the original.

00:12:52.313 --> 00:12:54.691 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU growls]

00:12:54.774 --> 00:12:56.234 position:50% align:center
[SIR NIGHTEYE]
For the next hour,

00:12:56.317 --> 00:12:58.570 position:50% align:center
provided the conditions are met.

00:12:58.653 --> 00:13:02.574 position:50% align:center
I can see what you'll do,
wherever you go.

00:13:06.119 --> 00:13:09.080 position:50% align:center
[SIR NIGHTEYE] In case you're
interested, two minutes

00:13:09.164 --> 00:13:10.707 position:50% align:center
from now you'll be
slumped on the floor

00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:13.543 position:50% align:center
with neither the seal
nor the contract.

00:13:14.878 --> 00:13:16.338 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU growls]

00:13:16.421 --> 00:13:19.341 position:50% align:center
[SIR NIGHTEYE] You've looked
unsure since this trial began.

00:13:19.424 --> 00:13:20.967 position:50% align:center
But All Might certainly
must have taught you

00:13:21.051 --> 00:13:23.094 position:50% align:center
better than that.

00:13:23.178 --> 00:13:24.846 position:50% align:center
Fear and indecision
are luxuries

00:13:24.929 --> 00:13:27.515 position:50% align:center
a top-tier hero cannot afford.

00:13:27.599 --> 00:13:28.808 position:50% align:center
Someone who understands that

00:13:28.892 --> 00:13:31.811 position:50% align:center
will always act with
vision and purpose.

00:13:31.895 --> 00:13:34.814 position:50% align:center
You must've been told
this countless times,

00:13:34.898 --> 00:13:36.733 position:50% align:center
but now, when your
training's being

00:13:36.816 --> 00:13:39.361 position:50% align:center
put to the test, you choke.

00:13:39.444 --> 00:13:41.780 position:50% align:center
You said you would
make me acknowledge you,

00:13:41.863 --> 00:13:44.532 position:50% align:center
but the more I see,
the more convinced I become

00:13:44.616 --> 00:13:47.285 position:50% align:center
that you will ultimately fail.

00:13:47.369 --> 00:13:49.412 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
He said I can do it!

00:13:49.496 --> 00:13:52.082 position:50% align:center
Who said that? One of
your little friends?

00:13:52.165 --> 00:13:54.876 position:50% align:center
The greatest hero the
world has ever seen!

00:13:58.421 --> 00:14:00.882 position:50% align:center
Sorry! But you did
say not to worry

00:14:00.965 --> 00:14:02.509 position:50% align:center
about the room, right?

00:14:03.677 --> 00:14:06.012 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
What he said about his power...

00:14:06.096 --> 00:14:07.681 position:50% align:center
[SIR NIGHTEYE]
For the next hour,

00:14:07.764 --> 00:14:09.808 position:50% align:center
provided the conditions are met.

00:14:09.891 --> 00:14:14.020 position:50% align:center
I can see what you'll do,
wherever you go.

00:14:16.231 --> 00:14:19.025 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] He can see what
I'll do, wherever I go.

00:14:19.109 --> 00:14:20.694 position:50% align:center
Why did he word it that way?

00:14:20.777 --> 00:14:22.737 position:50% align:center
What exactly is Nighteye seeing?

00:14:22.821 --> 00:14:24.364 position:50% align:center
Everything that's
going to happen?

00:14:24.447 --> 00:14:27.617 position:50% align:center
Or only the actions of
a specific target: me.

00:14:27.701 --> 00:14:30.161 position:50% align:center
Time to test my theory.

00:14:30.245 --> 00:14:31.788 position:50% align:center
I'll scatter objects at random.

00:14:31.871 --> 00:14:33.623 position:50% align:center
If I'm his sole target,
then his Foresight

00:14:33.707 --> 00:14:35.542 position:50% align:center
won't be able to reach them.

00:14:37.002 --> 00:14:40.922 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Nighteye. I'm not giving up now.

00:14:41.006 --> 00:14:43.174 position:50% align:center
Or ever.

00:14:43.258 --> 00:14:47.554 position:50% align:center
Whether you like it or not,
I am All Might's successor!

00:14:47.637 --> 00:14:49.139 position:50% align:center
That doesn't alter what I see.

00:14:49.222 --> 00:14:50.473 position:50% align:center
Not yet!

00:14:53.685 --> 00:14:55.979 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
I'm not done.

00:14:56.062 --> 00:14:56.730 position:50% align:center
[SIR NIGHTEYE]
It's over.

00:14:56.813 --> 00:14:58.106 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
No, it's not!

00:14:58.189 --> 00:14:59.899 position:50% align:center
[SIR NIGHTEYE]
Three minutes have passed.

00:14:59.983 --> 00:15:01.317 position:50% align:center
What?

00:15:01.401 --> 00:15:03.903 position:50% align:center
[SIR NIGHTEYE] You're All
Might's chosen successor?

00:15:03.987 --> 00:15:05.447 position:50% align:center
It beggars belief.

00:15:05.530 --> 00:15:09.034 position:50% align:center
You devised only a single plan,
and it failed spectacularly.

00:15:09.117 --> 00:15:10.744 position:50% align:center
Leaving you worn out.

00:15:10.827 --> 00:15:13.288 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] I didn't botch this
test because I'm tired.

00:15:13.371 --> 00:15:15.331 position:50% align:center
[SIR NIGHTEYE]
Then what happened?

00:15:15.415 --> 00:15:17.584 position:50% align:center
I realized I was about
to step on the poster

00:15:17.667 --> 00:15:20.211 position:50% align:center
for All Might's tenth
anniversary as a hero--

00:15:20.295 --> 00:15:22.630 position:50% align:center
the one that was never for sale.

00:15:22.714 --> 00:15:24.591 position:50% align:center
[SIR NIGHTEYE]
Don't tell me.

00:15:24.674 --> 00:15:27.927 position:50% align:center
He was in constant motion,
jumping as Gran Torino would,

00:15:28.011 --> 00:15:29.387 position:50% align:center
and yet he still
managed to avoid

00:15:29.471 --> 00:15:33.683 position:50% align:center
every image of
All Might in the room?

00:15:33.767 --> 00:15:36.978 position:50% align:center
Even emotionally off-balance
from my provocations,

00:15:37.062 --> 00:15:38.396 position:50% align:center
he formulated a strategy

00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:43.443 position:50% align:center
to defeat me and remained
aware of his surroundings.

00:15:43.526 --> 00:15:44.944 position:50% align:center
And cue our well-timed return!

00:15:45.028 --> 00:15:46.279 position:50% align:center
You're done, right, Sir?

00:15:46.363 --> 00:15:48.740 position:50% align:center
That loud bang at the end
sounded pretty final.

00:15:48.823 --> 00:15:50.283 position:50% align:center
[SIR NIGHTEYE]
I'll take the boy, Mirio.

00:15:50.367 --> 00:15:51.659 position:50% align:center
That's awesome!

00:15:51.743 --> 00:15:53.745 position:50% align:center
What? I don't understand.

00:15:53.828 --> 00:15:55.830 position:50% align:center
I didn't do either of the
things you asked me to.

00:15:55.914 --> 00:15:57.457 position:50% align:center
I told you to take
the seal from me

00:15:57.540 --> 00:15:59.125 position:50% align:center
and stamp the contract yourself,

00:15:59.209 --> 00:16:01.336 position:50% align:center
but I didn't say you'd
be rejected if you failed.

00:16:01.419 --> 00:16:03.254 position:50% align:center
Yeah, but...

00:16:03.338 --> 00:16:06.091 position:50% align:center
Congrats, Midoriya,
you pulled it off!

00:16:06.174 --> 00:16:08.927 position:50% align:center
So, he made you
laugh, after all.

00:16:09.010 --> 00:16:10.220 position:50% align:center
[SIR NIGHTEYE] I had
already decided I would

00:16:10.303 --> 00:16:14.099 position:50% align:center
take you on when I
heard you were coming.

00:16:14.182 --> 00:16:15.975 position:50% align:center
I also knew that
you weren't entirely

00:16:16.059 --> 00:16:17.686 position:50% align:center
lacking in skill and intellect.

00:16:17.769 --> 00:16:20.438 position:50% align:center
But I still wanted
to see it for myself.

00:16:21.940 --> 00:16:23.983 position:50% align:center
[SIR NIGHTEYE]
The symbol of peace is gone,

00:16:24.067 --> 00:16:26.152 position:50% align:center
and the people are looking
not for a dim light,

00:16:26.236 --> 00:16:29.280 position:50% align:center
but a dazzling one.

00:16:29.364 --> 00:16:32.033 position:50% align:center
You'll work here,
alongside professionals.

00:16:32.117 --> 00:16:33.410 position:50% align:center
And you will see.

00:16:33.493 --> 00:16:35.453 position:50% align:center
Regardless of
All Might's mandate,

00:16:35.537 --> 00:16:38.540 position:50% align:center
you are not worthy of his power.

00:16:38.623 --> 00:16:40.458 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] One For All
can only be transferred

00:16:40.542 --> 00:16:43.753 position:50% align:center
through the will of
its current user.

00:16:43.837 --> 00:16:46.673 position:50% align:center
He's taking me on
to make me give up.

00:16:47.799 --> 00:16:50.927 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] I'm All Might's
chosen successor.

00:16:51.011 --> 00:16:54.180 position:50% align:center
But Sir Nighteye
doesn't accept that.

00:16:54.264 --> 00:16:55.432 position:50% align:center
He believes that Togata

00:16:55.515 --> 00:16:58.727 position:50% align:center
should have been
selected instead.

00:16:58.810 --> 00:17:03.648 position:50% align:center
It makes for an unsettling
dynamic. But even so.

00:17:05.483 --> 00:17:08.820 position:50% align:center
I look forward to
working with you.

00:17:08.903 --> 00:17:10.989 position:50% align:center
[OCHACO] You found an agency
for your work study?

00:17:11.072 --> 00:17:12.449 position:50% align:center
Congratulations, Deku!

00:17:12.532 --> 00:17:13.283 position:50% align:center
That's awesome!

00:17:13.366 --> 00:17:15.493 position:50% align:center
Indeed. Well done, Midoriya.

00:17:15.577 --> 00:17:16.995 position:50% align:center
Thanks, guys.

00:17:17.078 --> 00:17:20.081 position:50% align:center
Thank you. You're an
example to us all.

00:17:20.165 --> 00:17:22.959 position:50% align:center
I dunno how the rest of us
are supposed to compete, though.

00:17:23.043 --> 00:17:25.128 position:50% align:center
Yeah, you'll be working
at Sir Nighteye's agency.

00:17:25.211 --> 00:17:26.755 position:50% align:center
That's seriously amazing.

00:17:26.838 --> 00:17:28.923 position:50% align:center
And I hear Togata
recommended you.

00:17:29.007 --> 00:17:30.383 position:50% align:center
Pretty impressive, man!

00:17:30.467 --> 00:17:32.969 position:50% align:center
Um. Yeah, I guess.

00:17:33.053 --> 00:17:35.597 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] Except, the only
reason he even took me on

00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:38.183 position:50% align:center
was to convince me
to give up One For All.

00:17:38.266 --> 00:17:40.769 position:50% align:center
The distance between us
just keeps getting wider.

00:17:40.852 --> 00:17:42.520 position:50% align:center
We've got to catch up and soon.

00:17:42.604 --> 00:17:43.396 position:50% align:center
Huh.

00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:44.939 position:50% align:center
I wish I had a place picked out.

00:17:45.023 --> 00:17:47.317 position:50% align:center
The school said Gunhead
hasn't had enough interns,

00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:49.444 position:50% align:center
so his agency is a no-go.

00:17:49.527 --> 00:17:50.862 position:50% align:center
I know what you mean.

00:17:50.945 --> 00:17:53.448 position:50% align:center
I wanted to go to Selkie's,
but that's out, too.

00:17:53.531 --> 00:17:55.200 position:50% align:center
Yeah, so is Fourth Kind.

00:17:55.283 --> 00:17:57.744 position:50% align:center
He doesn't even accept
students for work studies.

00:17:57.827 --> 00:18:00.705 position:50% align:center
The teachers sure aren't making
it easy for us, are they?

00:18:00.789 --> 00:18:02.082 position:50% align:center
Thanks to all
these requirements,

00:18:02.165 --> 00:18:04.793 position:50% align:center
a ton of agencies are ruled
out right off the bat.

00:18:04.876 --> 00:18:06.211 position:50% align:center
We can't really blame them.

00:18:06.294 --> 00:18:08.922 position:50% align:center
Unlike the internships,
we'll be directly involved,

00:18:09.005 --> 00:18:10.757 position:50% align:center
so if anything were
to go wrong, then...

00:18:10.840 --> 00:18:12.676 position:50% align:center
[AIZAWA] Then the pros
have to take responsibility

00:18:12.759 --> 00:18:13.885 position:50% align:center
for whatever happened.

00:18:13.968 --> 00:18:15.428 position:50% align:center
[KAMINARI]
Oh, hey, Mr. Aizawa!

00:18:15.512 --> 00:18:17.013 position:50% align:center
Only pros who're the real deal

00:18:17.097 --> 00:18:18.598 position:50% align:center
will take on rookies
like you guys,

00:18:18.682 --> 00:18:20.684 position:50% align:center
knowing the risks involved.

00:18:20.767 --> 00:18:24.729 position:50% align:center
Tokoyami, Looks like you've got
an offer from one of them.

00:18:24.813 --> 00:18:27.315 position:50% align:center
Hawks has invited you to
work with him in Kyushu.

00:18:27.399 --> 00:18:28.316 position:50% align:center
No way!

00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:30.276 position:50% align:center
Dude, he's the
Number Three Hero!

00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:31.236 position:50% align:center
That's awesome.

00:18:31.319 --> 00:18:33.113 position:50% align:center
[SATO]
Whoa! Good job!

00:18:33.196 --> 00:18:35.824 position:50% align:center
[AIZAWA]
Well, what d'ya say?

00:18:35.907 --> 00:18:37.283 position:50% align:center
[TOKOYAMI]
I respectfully accept.

00:18:37.367 --> 00:18:38.702 position:50% align:center
All right then.

00:18:38.785 --> 00:18:41.830 position:50% align:center
I'll make sure you get the
relevant paperwork later.

00:18:41.913 --> 00:18:44.290 position:50% align:center
Just let me know when
you're expected in Kyushu.

00:18:44.374 --> 00:18:46.251 position:50% align:center
I can sign off on your absences.

00:18:46.334 --> 00:18:48.253 position:50% align:center
Congrats, Tokoyami. You psyched?

00:18:48.336 --> 00:18:49.713 position:50% align:center
I am grateful, of course.

00:18:49.796 --> 00:18:51.339 position:50% align:center
We've really got to catch up.

00:18:51.423 --> 00:18:53.133 position:50% align:center
Would you stop saying that?

00:18:53.216 --> 00:18:56.636 position:50% align:center
Also, Kirishima. Apparently,
Amajiki from the Big Three

00:18:56.720 --> 00:18:59.097 position:50% align:center
wants to talk to you
about something.

00:18:59.180 --> 00:19:00.223 position:50% align:center
He wants me?

00:19:00.306 --> 00:19:02.350 position:50% align:center
Uraraka and Asui,
you've got your own

00:19:02.434 --> 00:19:04.144 position:50% align:center
Big Three summons from Hado.

00:19:04.227 --> 00:19:06.771 position:50% align:center
You can track 'em down
sometime tomorrow or whatever.

00:19:06.855 --> 00:19:07.856 position:50% align:center
That's all for now.

00:19:07.939 --> 00:19:09.941 position:50% align:center
Amajiki? That's crazy.

00:19:10.025 --> 00:19:11.109 position:50% align:center
I wonder what he wants.

00:19:11.192 --> 00:19:12.318 position:50% align:center
Considering the timing,

00:19:12.402 --> 00:19:14.237 position:50% align:center
it could be about the
work study program.

00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:15.321 position:50% align:center
No way!

00:19:15.405 --> 00:19:16.990 position:50% align:center
That'd be too good
to be true, right?

00:19:17.073 --> 00:19:19.534 position:50% align:center
I have ta' wait until tomorrow?

00:19:19.617 --> 00:19:22.412 position:50% align:center
Nope! I'm going over to the
third years' dorm right now!

00:19:22.495 --> 00:19:23.955 position:50% align:center
I don't think
I can wait, either.

00:19:24.039 --> 00:19:25.040 position:50% align:center
Let's go with him.

00:19:25.123 --> 00:19:26.875 position:50% align:center
[OCHACO]
Yeah!

00:19:26.958 --> 00:19:27.876 position:50% align:center
We've really, really gotta--

00:19:27.959 --> 00:19:29.169 position:50% align:center
Just shut up!

00:19:29.252 --> 00:19:31.212 position:50% align:center
Aw, man, I'm so
jealous of those guys.

00:19:31.296 --> 00:19:33.048 position:50% align:center
We'll just have to work harder.

00:19:33.131 --> 00:19:35.842 position:50% align:center
Heh. Who cares about
work studies anyway?

00:19:35.925 --> 00:19:38.219 position:50% align:center
First-years like us'll just
get stuck running errands

00:19:38.303 --> 00:19:40.138 position:50% align:center
and doing paperwork all day.

00:19:40.221 --> 00:19:42.974 position:50% align:center
Oh yeah, that's what happened
at your internship, huh?

00:19:43.058 --> 00:19:45.435 position:50% align:center
Don't remind me of
my disgraceful past!

00:19:45.518 --> 00:19:48.063 position:50% align:center
[STUDENTS laugh]

00:19:48.146 --> 00:19:51.399 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Tomorrow. I start tomorrow.

00:19:57.322 --> 00:19:58.698 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] The next day
marked the beginning

00:19:58.782 --> 00:20:00.825 position:50% align:center
of my work study.

00:20:00.909 --> 00:20:03.995 position:50% align:center
[SIR NIGHTEYE] Today, we will be
doing patrols and surveillance.

00:20:04.079 --> 00:20:05.663 position:50% align:center
We'll split up into two teams.

00:20:05.747 --> 00:20:08.500 position:50% align:center
I'll be with Bubble Girl and
Mirio, you're with Midoriya.

00:20:08.583 --> 00:20:09.751 position:50% align:center
Surveillance?

00:20:09.834 --> 00:20:11.336 position:50% align:center
Nighteye Agency is currently

00:20:11.419 --> 00:20:13.380 position:50% align:center
working on a
secret investigation.

00:20:13.463 --> 00:20:15.131 position:50% align:center
[SIR NIGHTEYE]
Shie Hassaikai is a small

00:20:15.215 --> 00:20:17.717 position:50% align:center
organized crime syndicate.

00:20:17.801 --> 00:20:19.719 position:50% align:center
That's Kai Chisaki.

00:20:19.803 --> 00:20:23.014 position:50% align:center
As the young head of the group,
he's its second-in-command,

00:20:23.098 --> 00:20:25.558 position:50% align:center
and he's been behaving
strangely lately.

00:20:25.642 --> 00:20:27.644 position:50% align:center
That plague mask
is his trademark.

00:20:27.727 --> 00:20:30.522 position:50% align:center
Creepy. I thought...

00:20:30.605 --> 00:20:32.440 position:50% align:center
...there wasn't much trouble
with organized crime

00:20:32.524 --> 00:20:33.817 position:50% align:center
these days, since
the police know

00:20:33.900 --> 00:20:36.111 position:50% align:center
who they are and monitor
their movements.

00:20:36.194 --> 00:20:38.863 position:50% align:center
It's been that way since
the big groups broke up.

00:20:38.947 --> 00:20:41.116 position:50% align:center
But this Chisaki guy is
starting to gather them

00:20:41.199 --> 00:20:43.702 position:50% align:center
together again, though
we don't know why.

00:20:43.785 --> 00:20:47.163 position:50% align:center
The details are unclear,
but we do know he made contact

00:20:47.247 --> 00:20:49.290 position:50% align:center
with the League
of Villains recently.

00:20:49.374 --> 00:20:50.875 position:50% align:center
The League of Villains?

00:20:53.003 --> 00:20:54.921 position:50% align:center
Unfortunately, we don't
have solid proof

00:20:55.005 --> 00:20:57.257 position:50% align:center
linking him to
anything criminal yet.

00:20:57.340 --> 00:20:59.467 position:50% align:center
Hassaikai operates
in a legal gray area

00:20:59.551 --> 00:21:03.763 position:50% align:center
that's close to black, but we
can't treat them like villains.

00:21:03.847 --> 00:21:07.600 position:50% align:center
Our objective is to tail them
and find out what they're up to.

00:21:07.684 --> 00:21:10.353 position:50% align:center
Be careful not to
arouse any suspicion.

00:21:10.437 --> 00:21:11.771 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU, MIRIO, BUBBLE GIRL]
Yes, sir!

00:22:42.821 --> 00:22:47.826 position:50% align:center
[ERI panting]

00:22:53.748 --> 00:22:57.168 position:50% align:center
[ERI]
Someone, anyone! Please.

00:23:02.382 --> 00:23:03.425 position:50% align:center
Whoa, I'm sorry.

00:23:03.508 --> 00:23:04.718 position:50% align:center
You really took a tumble there.

00:23:04.801 --> 00:23:05.802 position:50% align:center
[ERI gasps]

00:23:05.885 --> 00:23:09.931 position:50% align:center
Ah. Are you okay?
Can I help you up?

00:23:10.015 --> 00:23:12.350 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Why is she trembling like that?

00:23:12.434 --> 00:23:14.394 position:50% align:center
[CHISAKI]
You should be more careful.

00:23:14.477 --> 00:23:17.897 position:50% align:center
We don't wanna cause
trouble for the heroes.

00:23:17.981 --> 00:23:21.109 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] And just like that,
my work study...

00:23:22.110 --> 00:23:25.030 position:50% align:center
[CHISAKI]
Let's go home, Eri.

00:23:25.113 --> 00:23:26.698 position:50% align:center

Here's the preview!

00:23:30.994 --> 00:23:33.705 position:50% align:center
That horrible moment when
I had to let Eri go.

00:23:33.788 --> 00:23:35.749 position:50% align:center
Sir Nighteye's claim that
there's someone worthier

00:23:35.832 --> 00:23:37.917 position:50% align:center
than me to inherit One For All.

00:23:38.001 --> 00:23:39.586 position:50% align:center
I have so much to think about.

00:23:39.669 --> 00:23:41.671 position:50% align:center
So many pent-up feelings.

00:23:41.755 --> 00:23:44.591 position:50% align:center
And then, I learn a shocking
truth from All Might,

00:23:44.674 --> 00:23:46.384 position:50% align:center
about his future and
what Sir Nighteye

00:23:46.468 --> 00:23:49.929 position:50% align:center
believes it will hold.
It's all just too much.

00:23:50.013 --> 00:23:52.098 position:50% align:center
Next time, "Fighting Fate."

00:23:52.182 --> 00:23:55.018 position:50% align:center
That can't be right.
It just can't, All Might!

00:23:55.101 --> 00:23:57.687 position:50% align:center
Go beyond! Plus Ultra!
