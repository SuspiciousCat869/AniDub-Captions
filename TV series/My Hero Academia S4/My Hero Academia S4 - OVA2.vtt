00:00:10.552 --> 00:00:13.096 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] This world is a
superhuman society,

00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:15.098 position:50% align:center
with about 80 percent
of the population

00:00:15.181 --> 00:00:19.019 position:50% align:center
possessing some uncanny
ability called a "Quirk."

00:00:19.102 --> 00:00:20.603 position:50% align:center
Those who stand up
against villains

00:00:20.687 --> 00:00:24.107 position:50% align:center
who abuse their powers
for evil are called heroes.

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:26.401 position:50% align:center
They are our champions.

00:00:33.867 --> 00:00:36.786 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] Me and the rest of Class
1-A started a training exercise

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.540 position:50% align:center
to help us prepare for the
provisional hero licensing exam.

00:00:40.623 --> 00:00:44.085 position:50% align:center
It seemed like a
simple rescue mission.

00:00:44.169 --> 00:00:46.254 position:50% align:center
But soon after we started
searching for the dummy

00:00:46.338 --> 00:00:48.631 position:50% align:center
that was our target, the
underground mall we were in

00:00:48.715 --> 00:00:52.093 position:50% align:center
began to collapse,
leaving us trapped.

00:00:52.177 --> 00:00:54.137 position:50% align:center
While looking for an
escape route, my group met up

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:59.392 position:50% align:center
with Yaoyorozu and Iida, who
had been knocked unconscious.

00:00:59.476 --> 00:01:01.728 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] We did our best to
overcome each obstacle we faced

00:01:01.811 --> 00:01:03.938 position:50% align:center
as we fought through
a maze of debris.

00:01:04.022 --> 00:01:07.233 position:50% align:center
Finally, we reached the elevator
shafts to the surface.

00:01:07.317 --> 00:01:08.568 position:50% align:center
We thought we were safe.

00:01:08.651 --> 00:01:11.654 position:50% align:center
But our trials were
far from over.

00:01:11.738 --> 00:01:14.115 position:50% align:center
No, the actual test
of whether or not

00:01:14.199 --> 00:01:18.078 position:50% align:center
we could survive
was about to begin.

00:02:56.134 --> 00:02:58.470 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
I see sunlight at the top.

00:02:58.553 --> 00:03:00.430 position:50% align:center
Doesn't look like
anything's in the way.

00:03:00.513 --> 00:03:02.432 position:50% align:center
[OCHACO]
We can float out of here!

00:03:03.725 --> 00:03:05.769 position:50% align:center
Based on the map
we have of the building,

00:03:05.852 --> 00:03:09.230 position:50% align:center
it looks like the elevator shaft
only goes up to level B1.

00:03:09.314 --> 00:03:11.775 position:50% align:center
So how is there sunlight?

00:03:11.858 --> 00:03:13.526 position:50% align:center
From the collapse?

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:15.612 position:50% align:center
Maybe part of
the street fell in.

00:03:15.695 --> 00:03:19.449 position:50% align:center
If so, we can probably climb
out of here pretty easily.

00:03:19.532 --> 00:03:22.077 position:50% align:center
That would finally be
some positive news for us.

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:24.913 position:50% align:center
Yes. As long as we
have Ochaco's power,

00:03:24.996 --> 00:03:27.499 position:50% align:center
getting to the surface
should be no problem.

00:03:27.582 --> 00:03:29.959 position:50% align:center
All right. Let's get
a move on, then.

00:03:30.043 --> 00:03:32.170 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Wait a second, Uraraka.

00:03:32.253 --> 00:03:34.339 position:50% align:center
Yaoyorozu, once you
get to the top,

00:03:34.422 --> 00:03:36.591 position:50% align:center
will you throw down
a rope ladder for me?

00:03:36.675 --> 00:03:38.718 position:50% align:center
[YAOYOROZU]
Uh, sure, of course.

00:03:38.802 --> 00:03:39.844 position:50% align:center
Oh, I see.

00:03:39.928 --> 00:03:41.346 position:50% align:center
You're planning
to stay down here.

00:03:41.429 --> 00:03:43.807 position:50% align:center
You are? But why?

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:45.600 position:50% align:center
There might be more of
our classmates in here

00:03:45.684 --> 00:03:47.102 position:50% align:center
trapped by the fallen debris.

00:03:47.185 --> 00:03:50.313 position:50% align:center
They could even be hurt like
Iida and unable to get out.

00:03:50.397 --> 00:03:52.649 position:50% align:center
Go. I'll make sure
everyone's okay,

00:03:52.732 --> 00:03:55.652 position:50% align:center
then send them to this exit.
Iida still needs our help.

00:03:55.735 --> 00:03:58.488 position:50% align:center
Get him to Recovery Girl
as fast as you can.

00:03:58.571 --> 00:04:00.657 position:50% align:center
We won't let you down.

00:04:06.454 --> 00:04:08.540 position:50% align:center
Once he's safe,
make sure the teachers

00:04:08.623 --> 00:04:10.041 position:50% align:center
know what's going on down here.

00:04:10.125 --> 00:04:12.085 position:50% align:center
We will. Soon as we can.

00:04:12.168 --> 00:04:14.462 position:50% align:center
It's dangerous. Be careful.

00:04:14.546 --> 00:04:17.132 position:50% align:center
Deku. If things start
to look scary...

00:04:17.215 --> 00:04:20.385 position:50% align:center
I'll be fine, promise not
to take any chances.

00:04:25.265 --> 00:04:27.517 position:50% align:center
Right. Let's do this.

00:04:29.227 --> 00:04:32.397 position:50% align:center
[TOKOYAMI] I wonder, why did
the lights come back on?

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:35.525 position:50% align:center
It could be that the emergency
power rebooted itself,

00:04:35.608 --> 00:04:38.778 position:50% align:center
or it's possible that Denki
recharged the batteries.

00:04:38.862 --> 00:04:41.740 position:50% align:center
Ah, I see. Kaminari, yes.

00:04:41.823 --> 00:04:42.741 position:50% align:center
If that's the case,

00:04:42.824 --> 00:04:44.284 position:50% align:center
somebody else told
him what to do.

00:04:44.367 --> 00:04:47.620 position:50% align:center
So it must've been someone
who thinks quickly.

00:04:47.704 --> 00:04:49.622 position:50% align:center
Yaoyorozu or Midoriya.

00:04:49.706 --> 00:04:51.082 position:50% align:center
Unless...

00:04:51.166 --> 00:04:52.459 position:50% align:center
...it was him.

00:04:52.542 --> 00:04:55.045 position:50% align:center
[KIRISHIMA]
Bakugo! I found it!

00:04:55.128 --> 00:04:57.255 position:50% align:center
The training dummy
that needs rescuing!

00:04:57.339 --> 00:04:59.090 position:50% align:center
Nice! We nailed it!

00:04:59.174 --> 00:05:01.426 position:50% align:center
Huh! Stupid citizen
making us go through

00:05:01.509 --> 00:05:04.679 position:50% align:center
all this stupid extra work!
I'll beat you up later!

00:05:04.763 --> 00:05:06.473 position:50% align:center
Easy there, man.

00:05:06.556 --> 00:05:07.974 position:50% align:center
[KAMINARI]
But how do we get him out?

00:05:08.058 --> 00:05:10.393 position:50% align:center
If we grab him without a plan,
this whole pile of debris

00:05:10.477 --> 00:05:12.103 position:50% align:center
could come raining down on us.

00:05:12.187 --> 00:05:13.229 position:50% align:center
We'd end up buried.

00:05:13.313 --> 00:05:15.440 position:50% align:center
[KIRISHIMA]
What should we do, Bakugo?

00:05:15.523 --> 00:05:16.566 position:50% align:center
Blow it to hell!

00:05:16.649 --> 00:05:18.068 position:50% align:center
[KAMINARI]
Huh? Whoa, whoa.

00:05:18.151 --> 00:05:19.486 position:50% align:center
Didn't you hear
what I just said?

00:05:19.569 --> 00:05:21.529 position:50% align:center
I thought I explained
it pretty clearly!

00:05:21.613 --> 00:05:22.781 position:50% align:center
We'd be crushed!

00:05:22.864 --> 00:05:24.491 position:50% align:center
Look! It's unstable!

00:05:24.574 --> 00:05:26.910 position:50% align:center
Breathe too hard and
it could all collapse.

00:05:26.993 --> 00:05:28.119 position:50% align:center
I know.

00:05:28.203 --> 00:05:30.080 position:50% align:center
That's why we gotta
grab him before it does.

00:05:30.163 --> 00:05:31.956 position:50% align:center
[KAMINARI]
That makes no sense.

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:34.501 position:50% align:center
[KIRISHIMA] Kaminari, if it
wasn't a dummy over there

00:05:34.584 --> 00:05:36.795 position:50% align:center
but a trapped human being
calling for help,

00:05:36.878 --> 00:05:40.757 position:50% align:center
then what would you do?
Give up and say it's impossible?

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:45.762 position:50% align:center
[KAMINARI] Uh. No.
But this isn't a real person.

00:05:45.845 --> 00:05:47.889 position:50% align:center
It's training. I'm only saying

00:05:47.972 --> 00:05:50.975 position:50% align:center
that we shouldn't have to risk
our lives to rescue a doll.

00:05:51.059 --> 00:05:53.103 position:50% align:center
Bakugo's got an idea. Don't you?

00:05:53.186 --> 00:05:54.229 position:50% align:center
Of course I do.

00:05:54.312 --> 00:05:55.939 position:50% align:center
Then let's act fast.

00:05:56.022 --> 00:05:58.441 position:50% align:center
That's the entire reason
we're down here.

00:05:58.525 --> 00:06:01.069 position:50% align:center
We came to UA High
to become heroes.

00:06:01.152 --> 00:06:02.737 position:50% align:center
Isn't that right, Kaminari?

00:06:02.821 --> 00:06:04.197 position:50% align:center
[KAMINARI]
Well, I guess so, but...

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:05.532 position:50% align:center
[KATSUKI]
Stop complaining!

00:06:05.615 --> 00:06:07.742 position:50% align:center
Let's hurry up and
save 'im, you extras!

00:06:07.826 --> 00:06:10.036 position:50% align:center
[KAMINARI] At least
tell us your plan first!

00:06:24.342 --> 00:06:27.762 position:50% align:center
[OCHACO gasps]
Look! Straight to the street!

00:06:27.846 --> 00:06:30.932 position:50% align:center
[YAOYOROZU] Uraraka, get Iida
to Recovery Girl right away.

00:06:31.016 --> 00:06:34.811 position:50% align:center
Asui, please go along with them
and report to Mr. Aizawa.

00:06:34.894 --> 00:06:36.771 position:50% align:center
I'll stay here and
make the rope ladder.

00:06:36.855 --> 00:06:40.442 position:50% align:center
[AIZAWA] Are you the only ones
who were able to escape?

00:06:40.525 --> 00:06:42.277 position:50% align:center
[OCHACO]
Mr. Aizawa!

00:06:47.073 --> 00:06:49.617 position:50% align:center
[KATSUKI] Ready, idiots?
Don't screw this up.

00:06:49.701 --> 00:06:51.494 position:50% align:center
--Right!
--[KIRISHIMA] I'm on it.

00:06:51.578 --> 00:06:53.371 position:50% align:center
Just make sure you don't hit me!

00:06:53.455 --> 00:06:56.708 position:50% align:center
Take this! AP Shot!

00:06:56.791 --> 00:06:58.960 position:50% align:center
Go! Now!

00:07:04.799 --> 00:07:05.967 position:50% align:center
I got him!

00:07:14.059 --> 00:07:14.851 position:50% align:center
[KATSUKI]
Watch out!

00:07:14.934 --> 00:07:16.102 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:07:17.687 --> 00:07:21.232 position:50% align:center
Die, die, die, die!

00:07:22.233 --> 00:07:24.235 position:50% align:center
[rumbling]

00:07:24.319 --> 00:07:27.364 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU gasps] What the heck
was that? A collapse?

00:07:27.447 --> 00:07:29.991 position:50% align:center
No, wait, it sounded
more like an explosion.

00:07:30.075 --> 00:07:32.077 position:50% align:center
On a lower floor, maybe.

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:34.704 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU gasps]
Could it be...?

00:07:36.414 --> 00:07:37.916 position:50% align:center
That sound.

00:07:37.999 --> 00:07:39.501 position:50% align:center
Must be Bakugo.

00:07:39.584 --> 00:07:41.211 position:50% align:center
This building is
still on the verge

00:07:41.294 --> 00:07:42.879 position:50% align:center
of falling in on itself.

00:07:42.962 --> 00:07:45.048 position:50% align:center
How can he be so
reckless right now?

00:07:45.131 --> 00:07:47.384 position:50% align:center
I believe that blast came
from somewhere below us.

00:07:47.467 --> 00:07:50.720 position:50% align:center
[TODOROKI] Floor B6.
That's the bottom level.

00:07:50.804 --> 00:07:53.723 position:50% align:center
Of course he would be
in the most unstable area.

00:07:53.807 --> 00:07:55.934 position:50% align:center
[TODOROKI gasps]
Bakugo was the one

00:07:56.017 --> 00:07:58.436 position:50% align:center
who restored the
emergency power.

00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:00.897 position:50% align:center
And he's the cause
of this explosion.

00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:02.148 position:50% align:center
Oh, come on.

00:08:02.232 --> 00:08:04.025 position:50% align:center
Don't tell me he's
continuing the training

00:08:04.109 --> 00:08:05.985 position:50% align:center
like nothing has happened.

00:08:06.069 --> 00:08:07.278 position:50% align:center
[water hissing]

00:08:07.362 --> 00:08:08.405 position:50% align:center
Look!

00:08:10.657 --> 00:08:14.828 position:50% align:center
[whimpering] What should we do?

00:08:14.911 --> 00:08:16.413 position:50% align:center
Fix it, fix it, fix it!

00:08:16.496 --> 00:08:18.832 position:50% align:center
I told you guys we needed
to be careful down here!

00:08:18.915 --> 00:08:20.000 position:50% align:center
Shut up!

00:08:20.083 --> 00:08:23.169 position:50% align:center
No use whining, man!
Head for the stairs.

00:08:25.922 --> 00:08:27.632 position:50% align:center
Where's this water coming from?

00:08:27.716 --> 00:08:30.552 position:50% align:center
If we don't so something
fast, we're gonna drown.

00:08:30.635 --> 00:08:32.137 position:50% align:center
Tell me you know
what to do, Bakugo!

00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:33.763 position:50% align:center
[KATSUKI]

00:08:33.847 --> 00:08:35.724 position:50% align:center
[RECOVERY GIRL]
Smooch!

00:08:35.807 --> 00:08:37.851 position:50% align:center
Wait, so you're not
going to save them?

00:08:37.934 --> 00:08:40.353 position:50% align:center
How can you leave them
down there, Mr. Aizawa?

00:08:40.437 --> 00:08:41.438 position:50% align:center
Could the collapse

00:08:41.521 --> 00:08:42.981 position:50% align:center
of the underground
mall have been...

00:08:43.064 --> 00:08:45.734 position:50% align:center
[AIZAWA] ...within the expected
parameters of the exercise?

00:08:45.817 --> 00:08:47.277 position:50% align:center
Just think for a minute.

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:49.946 position:50% align:center
If you can't get past
a simple crisis like this one,

00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:52.073 position:50% align:center
it's unlikely that
you'll pass the exam.

00:08:52.157 --> 00:08:54.492 position:50% align:center
Sure, but Iida got
hurt down there!

00:08:54.576 --> 00:08:56.202 position:50% align:center
And our other classmates
might be trapped

00:08:56.286 --> 00:08:57.704 position:50% align:center
and in need of help right now.

00:08:57.787 --> 00:09:00.081 position:50% align:center
In that case, they're
no longer heroes.

00:09:00.165 --> 00:09:02.625 position:50% align:center
They're victims in need
of assistance now.

00:09:02.709 --> 00:09:04.127 position:50% align:center
So who will rescue them?

00:09:04.210 --> 00:09:05.712 position:50% align:center
I'll get the rope ladder ready!

00:09:05.795 --> 00:09:06.713 position:50% align:center
[OCHACO]
I can help, too!

00:09:06.796 --> 00:09:09.174 position:50% align:center
[TSUYU]
Ribbit!

00:09:09.257 --> 00:09:12.677 position:50% align:center
[RECOVERY GIRL] Don't you think
this is a little much?

00:09:12.761 --> 00:09:16.097 position:50% align:center
I've made arrangements
if things go poorly.

00:09:18.350 --> 00:09:19.601 position:50% align:center
Tokoyami.

00:09:19.684 --> 00:09:21.936 position:50% align:center
You have to break the
floor with Dark Shadow.

00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:23.438 position:50% align:center
But I won't be able
to control him

00:09:23.521 --> 00:09:25.732 position:50% align:center
if there's no light.

00:09:25.815 --> 00:09:27.859 position:50% align:center
Then let me hold
him back for you.

00:09:27.942 --> 00:09:30.945 position:50% align:center
Right, then. Dark Shadow!

00:09:31.029 --> 00:09:33.156 position:50% align:center
[roars]

00:09:33.239 --> 00:09:36.326 position:50% align:center
I don't think
I can go any farther!

00:09:38.661 --> 00:09:40.288 position:50% align:center
Oh, no, what now?

00:09:44.125 --> 00:09:46.378 position:50% align:center
[TODOROKI]
This way! Climb up, quick.

00:09:46.461 --> 00:09:47.587 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
Todoroki!

00:09:47.671 --> 00:09:50.215 position:50% align:center
Nobody asked you for
your help here, Icy Hot.

00:09:50.298 --> 00:09:52.133 position:50% align:center
Are you freaking
kidding me right now?

00:09:52.217 --> 00:09:53.718 position:50% align:center
We were gonna die here.

00:09:53.802 --> 00:09:56.554 position:50% align:center
A villain could be helping
us and I'd be happy.

00:09:56.638 --> 00:09:58.431 position:50% align:center
[TODOROKI]
Let's go. We have to move.

00:09:58.515 --> 00:09:59.766 position:50% align:center
[KIRISHIMA]
Bakugo, come on!

00:09:59.849 --> 00:10:01.017 position:50% align:center
[KATSUKI]
Stop pulling me!

00:10:01.101 --> 00:10:03.144 position:50% align:center
[KIRISHIMA]
Then start climbing!

00:10:03.228 --> 00:10:07.565 position:50% align:center
[KAMINARI pants]
That was close.

00:10:07.649 --> 00:10:10.819 position:50% align:center
I'll say. Thanks, guys.
You saved us.

00:10:10.902 --> 00:10:12.404 position:50% align:center
We're happy to assist.

00:10:12.487 --> 00:10:13.571 position:50% align:center
Tch.

00:10:13.655 --> 00:10:16.032 position:50% align:center
[TODOROKI]
We can't relax yet.

00:10:16.116 --> 00:10:18.993 position:50% align:center
The water in here is
gonna continue to rise.

00:10:19.077 --> 00:10:20.954 position:50% align:center
I'll freeze it to the
best of my ability.

00:10:21.037 --> 00:10:22.872 position:50% align:center
In the meantime,
the rest of you can escape.

00:10:22.956 --> 00:10:25.000 position:50% align:center
By yourself?
I'll stay with you.

00:10:25.083 --> 00:10:26.668 position:50% align:center
I appreciate the offer.

00:10:26.751 --> 00:10:29.129 position:50% align:center
But your Quirks
aren't right for this.

00:10:29.212 --> 00:10:31.840 position:50% align:center
I don't want you to get
caught up in the ice.

00:10:31.923 --> 00:10:34.134 position:50% align:center
If you don't wanna
be a burden, then go.

00:10:34.217 --> 00:10:35.510 position:50% align:center
Leave this to me.

00:10:35.593 --> 00:10:37.262 position:50% align:center
As Todoroki is saying,

00:10:37.345 --> 00:10:39.347 position:50% align:center
this is still a race
against the clock.

00:10:39.431 --> 00:10:40.390 position:50% align:center
We should make haste.

00:10:40.473 --> 00:10:41.975 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Right.

00:10:42.058 --> 00:10:45.729 position:50% align:center
Always gotta be so cool, huh?
Fine, then we'll see you up top!

00:10:45.812 --> 00:10:47.313 position:50% align:center
[TODOROKI]
Yeah.

00:10:54.070 --> 00:10:56.281 position:50% align:center
[TODOROKI]
In a sprawling space like this,

00:10:56.364 --> 00:10:59.534 position:50% align:center
I can only freeze so much.

00:10:59.617 --> 00:11:02.996 position:50% align:center
But I'll make sure
I stall as long as I can.

00:11:03.079 --> 00:11:05.498 position:50% align:center
So my classmates can escape.

00:11:14.257 --> 00:11:16.509 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU pants]

00:11:16.593 --> 00:11:18.845 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
It got cold all of a sudden.

00:11:20.263 --> 00:11:22.724 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] That could mean
Todoroki is using his ice.

00:11:22.807 --> 00:11:24.893 position:50% align:center
Maybe to reinforce the building?

00:11:24.976 --> 00:11:28.355 position:50% align:center
I need to get to
the bottom fast.

00:11:28.438 --> 00:11:30.940 position:50% align:center
Even if I have to
force my way down!

00:11:36.279 --> 00:11:37.739 position:50% align:center
Uh-- Midoriya?

00:11:37.822 --> 00:11:38.782 position:50% align:center
Thank goodness.

00:11:38.865 --> 00:11:41.368 position:50% align:center
I found you guys!
And so quickly!

00:11:41.451 --> 00:11:43.244 position:50% align:center
How are you? Is anyone hurt?

00:11:43.328 --> 00:11:45.080 position:50% align:center
No. We're okay.

00:11:45.163 --> 00:11:47.248 position:50% align:center
Good, listen. Keep
heading up that way.

00:11:47.332 --> 00:11:49.334 position:50% align:center
Once you find the elevator,
there'll be a rope ladder

00:11:49.417 --> 00:11:52.379 position:50% align:center
you can climb to the top.
It'll lead you to the surface.

00:11:52.462 --> 00:11:53.505 position:50% align:center
[KIRISHIMA]
For real?

00:11:53.588 --> 00:11:55.548 position:50% align:center
Okay, so maybe we
won't die down here.

00:11:55.632 --> 00:11:56.716 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:11:56.800 --> 00:11:59.177 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] Tokoyami.
You were with Todoroki.

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:00.929 position:50% align:center
Do you know if he's
still in the mall?

00:12:01.012 --> 00:12:02.972 position:50% align:center
Yes, and water is
flooding the structure.

00:12:03.056 --> 00:12:04.724 position:50% align:center
He's holding it back
with his ice.

00:12:04.808 --> 00:12:06.768 position:50% align:center
Does he think that's
even possible?

00:12:06.851 --> 00:12:09.270 position:50% align:center
[TOKOYAMI]
And that's not all.

00:12:09.354 --> 00:12:12.440 position:50% align:center
[YAOYOROZU pants]

00:12:12.524 --> 00:12:13.775 position:50% align:center
Just a little more.

00:12:13.858 --> 00:12:15.193 position:50% align:center
You can do it.

00:12:15.276 --> 00:12:17.362 position:50% align:center
[panting]

00:12:17.445 --> 00:12:18.863 position:50% align:center
[KIRISHIMA]
Hey, where's the ladder?

00:12:18.947 --> 00:12:20.156 position:50% align:center
[KAMINARI]
Did they pull it up?

00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:21.199 position:50% align:center
Kirishima?

00:12:21.282 --> 00:12:23.660 position:50% align:center
And I heard
Kaminari's voice, too.

00:12:23.743 --> 00:12:26.955 position:50% align:center
Are you guys okay?
Can you hear me?

00:12:27.038 --> 00:12:29.124 position:50% align:center
[KAMINARI]
Hear that? It's Uraraka!

00:12:29.207 --> 00:12:31.835 position:50% align:center
[OCHACO] Hi! We're working
on the ladder now,

00:12:31.918 --> 00:12:33.962 position:50% align:center
so hang on a little longer!

00:12:34.045 --> 00:12:35.088 position:50% align:center
You got it!

00:12:35.171 --> 00:12:36.715 position:50% align:center
I'm guessing
Yaoyorozu's the one

00:12:36.798 --> 00:12:38.591 position:50% align:center
who's making it, right?

00:12:38.675 --> 00:12:41.094 position:50% align:center
Sorry to put you
through this, but thanks!

00:12:41.177 --> 00:12:43.388 position:50% align:center
[YAOYOROZU]
No. My pleasure.

00:12:43.471 --> 00:12:45.557 position:50% align:center
Plus Ultra. You know?

00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:47.308 position:50% align:center
Please hold on.

00:12:51.062 --> 00:12:52.772 position:50% align:center
It was a lot of water,
but it looks like

00:12:52.856 --> 00:12:55.066 position:50% align:center
I was able to stop
it from rising.

00:12:55.150 --> 00:12:56.484 position:50% align:center
Question is...

00:12:56.568 --> 00:12:58.319 position:50% align:center
Why are you still here, Bakugo?

00:12:58.403 --> 00:13:00.363 position:50% align:center
'Cause I don't wanna
owe you anything.

00:13:00.447 --> 00:13:02.615 position:50% align:center
Let's just get up the
stairs while we can.

00:13:02.699 --> 00:13:04.492 position:50% align:center
It's too late.

00:13:04.576 --> 00:13:07.871 position:50% align:center
No way we're gonna be able
to walk outta here now.

00:13:09.414 --> 00:13:12.792 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] No matter how
amazing Todoroki's ice is,

00:13:12.876 --> 00:13:15.462 position:50% align:center
I can't imagine he'll be able
to freeze every drop of water

00:13:15.545 --> 00:13:17.922 position:50% align:center
that's gushing into
the bottom floor.

00:13:18.006 --> 00:13:20.675 position:50% align:center
He's probably only been able
to freeze the top layer.

00:13:20.759 --> 00:13:23.345 position:50% align:center
Which means water is still
building up underneath.

00:13:23.428 --> 00:13:24.721 position:50% align:center
There must be
incredible pressure

00:13:24.804 --> 00:13:27.474 position:50% align:center
below that sheet of ice.

00:13:27.557 --> 00:13:31.019 position:50% align:center
It's like a time bomb.
Force is building up below.

00:13:31.102 --> 00:13:32.604 position:50% align:center
And as soon as it
gets strong enough,

00:13:32.687 --> 00:13:37.150 position:50% align:center
the walls're gonna break
and pummel us with debris.

00:13:37.233 --> 00:13:38.526 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Worst-case scenario,

00:13:38.610 --> 00:13:41.071 position:50% align:center
the whole underground mall
will end up collapsing.

00:13:41.154 --> 00:13:43.865 position:50% align:center
Obviously I already predicted
that this would happen.

00:13:43.948 --> 00:13:45.200 position:50% align:center
[KATSUKI]
Oh, shut up!

00:13:45.283 --> 00:13:48.828 position:50% align:center
But I still don't get
why you stayed behind.

00:13:48.912 --> 00:13:49.913 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Kacchan didn't leave

00:13:49.996 --> 00:13:52.415 position:50% align:center
because he wants
to rescue Todoroki.

00:13:52.499 --> 00:13:54.334 position:50% align:center
Which means...

00:13:54.417 --> 00:13:58.588 position:50% align:center
He must have an idea of how to
get them outta this situation.

00:13:58.672 --> 00:14:02.717 position:50% align:center
But what would he do?
If I were Kacchan...

00:14:02.801 --> 00:14:05.303 position:50% align:center
...how would I do this?

00:14:05.387 --> 00:14:07.806 position:50% align:center
You've thought ahead, huh?
So what's your plan?

00:14:07.889 --> 00:14:11.184 position:50% align:center
Listen carefully, you
Half-and-Half Bastard.

00:14:11.267 --> 00:14:13.103 position:50% align:center
We use the water to escape.

00:14:13.186 --> 00:14:14.938 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna blast
a hole in the ice.

00:14:15.021 --> 00:14:17.357 position:50% align:center
That'll make a geyser for us.

00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:20.026 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] When the pressurized
water bursts through,

00:14:20.110 --> 00:14:21.861 position:50% align:center
Todoroki can freeze
a layer at the top

00:14:21.945 --> 00:14:24.864 position:50% align:center
for them to stand on
and ride upwards.

00:14:24.948 --> 00:14:27.117 position:50% align:center
I'll keep shooting as we fly up.

00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:30.578 position:50% align:center
We'll rocket through
every floor.

00:14:30.662 --> 00:14:33.957 position:50% align:center
I bet we can even beat those
losers to the surface.

00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:36.042 position:50% align:center
I understand the fundamentals.

00:14:36.126 --> 00:14:38.962 position:50% align:center
But... can you focus
your explosions?

00:14:39.045 --> 00:14:41.464 position:50% align:center
It'll have to be a precise shot
in order for this to work.

00:14:41.548 --> 00:14:43.258 position:50% align:center
[KATSUKI]
Don't question me!

00:14:43.341 --> 00:14:45.468 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
No, even if it is Kacchan,

00:14:45.552 --> 00:14:48.013 position:50% align:center
the chance of success
is pretty low.

00:14:48.096 --> 00:14:49.681 position:50% align:center
With my Shoot Style, though,

00:14:49.764 --> 00:14:52.934 position:50% align:center
I should be able to make a big
enough hole in the ice for them.

00:14:53.018 --> 00:14:54.686 position:50% align:center
It'll be easy
thanks to Costume Gamma

00:14:54.769 --> 00:14:56.771 position:50% align:center
that Hatsume made for me.

00:14:56.855 --> 00:14:59.274 position:50% align:center
That and my increased stamina
let me up the percentage

00:14:59.357 --> 00:15:01.651 position:50% align:center
of One For All I can control.

00:15:04.154 --> 00:15:05.780 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Kacchan! Todoroki!

00:15:05.864 --> 00:15:06.781 position:50% align:center
Midoriya!

00:15:06.865 --> 00:15:07.824 position:50% align:center
Ah, great, what the hell

00:15:07.907 --> 00:15:09.743 position:50% align:center
are you doing here,
you damn nerd?!

00:15:09.826 --> 00:15:11.578 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] Hold on.
I'll open a hole in the ice.

00:15:11.661 --> 00:15:12.996 position:50% align:center
[KATSUKI]
You little--

00:15:13.079 --> 00:15:15.165 position:50% align:center
Just be ready to freeze
a platform for us to stand on.

00:15:15.248 --> 00:15:16.499 position:50% align:center
[TODOROKI]
Got it.

00:15:16.583 --> 00:15:18.793 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] Kacchan, make sure
you blast every ceiling.

00:15:18.877 --> 00:15:21.171 position:50% align:center
Don't you dare
tell me what to do!

00:15:24.674 --> 00:15:27.886 position:50% align:center
There's no time. Here I go!

00:15:27.969 --> 00:15:31.765 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] One For All:
Full Cowling, five percent!

00:16:07.592 --> 00:16:08.968 position:50% align:center
[KIRISHIMA]
Kaminari!

00:16:09.969 --> 00:16:11.429 position:50% align:center
[TSUYU]
Tokoyami!

00:16:11.513 --> 00:16:13.139 position:50% align:center
[TOKOYAMI]
Reach for my hand.

00:16:15.392 --> 00:16:17.185 position:50% align:center
[sighs] That was so scary.

00:16:17.268 --> 00:16:18.186 position:50% align:center
Let's get going.

00:16:18.269 --> 00:16:19.437 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Okay!

00:16:19.521 --> 00:16:20.563 position:50% align:center
Nice catch!

00:16:20.647 --> 00:16:22.023 position:50% align:center
Ribbit, ribbit.

00:16:27.654 --> 00:16:28.988 position:50% align:center
Where am I?

00:16:29.072 --> 00:16:30.949 position:50% align:center
[YAOYOROZU] Oh! Thank goodness
you're conscious again.

00:16:31.032 --> 00:16:32.909 position:50% align:center
I'm so glad!

00:16:32.992 --> 00:16:35.995 position:50% align:center
Yaoyorozu. What
happened to me?

00:16:36.079 --> 00:16:37.497 position:50% align:center
[YAOYOROZU]
The underground mall.

00:16:37.580 --> 00:16:39.791 position:50% align:center
It collapsed during
our training.

00:16:39.874 --> 00:16:42.168 position:50% align:center
Yes, that's right.

00:16:42.252 --> 00:16:43.670 position:50% align:center
I remember.

00:16:45.964 --> 00:16:47.465 position:50% align:center
You carried me out.

00:16:47.549 --> 00:16:49.676 position:50% align:center
It must have caused a lot
of trouble for you.

00:16:49.759 --> 00:16:51.011 position:50% align:center
I'm grateful.

00:16:51.094 --> 00:16:53.346 position:50% align:center
No, I'm the one who should
be thanking you, Iida.

00:16:53.430 --> 00:16:56.224 position:50% align:center
If you hadn't acted, I'm not
sure what would have happened.

00:16:56.307 --> 00:16:57.892 position:50% align:center
It was nothing.

00:16:59.019 --> 00:17:01.604 position:50% align:center
But where are the rest
of our classmates?

00:17:01.688 --> 00:17:02.480 position:50% align:center
[KIRISHIMA]
Hey!

00:17:02.564 --> 00:17:03.982 position:50% align:center
[YAOYOROZU gasps]

00:17:04.065 --> 00:17:07.193 position:50% align:center
[TENYA]
Kirishima, Kaminari, Tokoyami!

00:17:07.277 --> 00:17:10.363 position:50% align:center
And Uraraka and Asui, too! Ha!

00:17:10.447 --> 00:17:12.449 position:50% align:center
I told you to call me "Tsu"!

00:17:12.532 --> 00:17:17.620 position:50% align:center
And Tsu, of course.
I'm so glad you're all safe.

00:17:17.704 --> 00:17:20.832 position:50% align:center
But aren't we missing
three people from Team A?

00:17:20.915 --> 00:17:22.792 position:50% align:center
[KIRISHIMA]
Yeah, about that.

00:17:22.876 --> 00:17:24.461 position:50% align:center
So water suddenly
started flooding

00:17:24.544 --> 00:17:26.004 position:50% align:center
into the bottom of the mall.

00:17:26.087 --> 00:17:29.174 position:50% align:center
Todoroki bought us some time
to escape by using his ice.

00:17:29.257 --> 00:17:31.676 position:50% align:center
Bakugo stayed behind to assist.

00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:33.845 position:50% align:center
And when Midoriya
heard that, he took off,

00:17:33.928 --> 00:17:35.930 position:50% align:center
saying he was gonna
help save 'em both.

00:17:36.014 --> 00:17:37.432 position:50% align:center
Wait, he did what?

00:17:37.515 --> 00:17:40.685 position:50% align:center
You mean that the three of them
are all still down there?

00:17:42.354 --> 00:17:43.813 position:50% align:center
I'm sure they're okay!

00:17:43.897 --> 00:17:45.815 position:50% align:center
If Deku said he was
going to save them,

00:17:45.899 --> 00:17:49.069 position:50% align:center
then it's because he knew
that he could save them.

00:17:49.152 --> 00:17:50.111 position:50% align:center
And anyway,

00:17:50.195 --> 00:17:52.030 position:50% align:center
Bakugo and Todoroki
are way strong!

00:17:52.113 --> 00:17:54.240 position:50% align:center
They won't go down
without a fight.

00:17:54.324 --> 00:17:55.325 position:50% align:center
Don't worry.

00:17:55.408 --> 00:17:58.036 position:50% align:center
All three of them
are gonna be fine!

00:17:58.119 --> 00:18:01.039 position:50% align:center
Yes, you're right. Okay.

00:18:01.122 --> 00:18:02.665 position:50% align:center
Let's think about
all our Quirks.

00:18:02.749 --> 00:18:04.668 position:50% align:center
How can we help them out?

00:18:04.751 --> 00:18:07.379 position:50% align:center
I trust everyone here
wants to aid our classmates?

00:18:07.462 --> 00:18:08.588 position:50% align:center
--[KIRISHIMA] Yeah!
--[TSUYU] Ribbit!

00:18:08.672 --> 00:18:10.131 position:50% align:center
[OCHACO]
We've totally got this.

00:18:10.215 --> 00:18:11.716 position:50% align:center
[KIRISHIMA]
Besides, if I know those guys,

00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:13.635 position:50% align:center
they're already heading
toward the surface!

00:18:13.718 --> 00:18:16.221 position:50% align:center
[TSUYU] Let's start
searching on floor B2.

00:18:24.521 --> 00:18:28.858 position:50% align:center
[pants]

00:18:32.362 --> 00:18:33.780 position:50% align:center
[TODOROKI]
Midoriya.

00:18:37.617 --> 00:18:40.870 position:50% align:center
[TODOROKI]
Hey. Midoriya. Wake up!

00:18:46.001 --> 00:18:47.460 position:50% align:center
Todoroki?

00:18:47.544 --> 00:18:49.963 position:50% align:center
[TODOROKI]
Are you injured?

00:18:50.046 --> 00:18:52.632 position:50% align:center
I'll probably feel like
I got hit by a truck,

00:18:52.716 --> 00:18:54.509 position:50% align:center
but I can still move all right.

00:18:54.592 --> 00:18:56.344 position:50% align:center
What floor did we land on?

00:18:56.428 --> 00:18:59.431 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] We destroyed the ceiling
three times by my count,

00:18:59.514 --> 00:19:02.684 position:50% align:center
so we're probably on level B3.

00:19:02.767 --> 00:19:05.603 position:50% align:center
That's good. We made
it pretty far up.

00:19:05.687 --> 00:19:07.772 position:50% align:center
The water won't be able
to catch us now.

00:19:07.856 --> 00:19:09.315 position:50% align:center
We're close to the surface.

00:19:09.399 --> 00:19:11.484 position:50% align:center
It's all thanks
to you, Todoroki.

00:19:11.568 --> 00:19:15.488 position:50% align:center
And Kacchan's blasts.
Wait, where is he?

00:19:15.572 --> 00:19:17.490 position:50% align:center
What happened to Kacchan?

00:19:17.574 --> 00:19:19.325 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU gasps]

00:19:19.409 --> 00:19:20.827 position:50% align:center
Oh, no!

00:19:20.910 --> 00:19:22.162 position:50% align:center
[TODOROKI]
Bakugo!

00:19:28.376 --> 00:19:31.004 position:50% align:center
He's hurt!

00:19:31.087 --> 00:19:34.632 position:50% align:center
Come on, you gotta
wake up! Kacchan!

00:19:34.716 --> 00:19:35.633 position:50% align:center
[groans]

00:19:35.717 --> 00:19:37.761 position:50% align:center
Stop yelling in
my ear, ya idiot.

00:19:37.844 --> 00:19:39.387 position:50% align:center
It's annoying.

00:19:39.471 --> 00:19:41.056 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Yeah, okay.

00:19:41.139 --> 00:19:43.892 position:50% align:center
[TODOROKI] Bakugo. Lean on me
and Midoriya so you can walk.

00:19:43.975 --> 00:19:45.685 position:50% align:center
We're almost out of here.

00:19:45.769 --> 00:19:48.897 position:50% align:center
This injury's nothing.
I'm just fine on my own.

00:19:48.980 --> 00:19:50.231 position:50% align:center
Don't push yourself.

00:19:50.315 --> 00:19:52.734 position:50% align:center
I'll get out of here
without anyone's help.

00:19:52.817 --> 00:19:55.945 position:50% align:center
Kacchan. We don't have
the time. Please.

00:19:56.029 --> 00:19:57.113 position:50% align:center
Grab onto me.

00:19:57.197 --> 00:19:58.239 position:50% align:center
Not a chance.

00:19:58.323 --> 00:19:59.908 position:50% align:center
You have to!

00:19:59.991 --> 00:20:03.203 position:50% align:center
[KATSUKI] I'm gonna walk out
by myself even if it kills me!

00:20:03.286 --> 00:20:06.664 position:50% align:center
A guy who needs help for
a scratch like this is weak.

00:20:06.748 --> 00:20:10.001 position:50% align:center
I'm never gonna be the
number-one hero if I can't--

00:20:10.085 --> 00:20:11.628 position:50% align:center
You seem unsteady.

00:20:11.711 --> 00:20:15.465 position:50% align:center
[KATSUKI] My feet just won't
do what I'm telling them to!

00:20:15.548 --> 00:20:17.467 position:50% align:center
Kacchan. Gimme your arm.

00:20:17.550 --> 00:20:19.010 position:50% align:center
[KATSUKI]
Let go, Deku!

00:20:19.094 --> 00:20:19.844 position:50% align:center
Come on!

00:20:19.928 --> 00:20:21.179 position:50% align:center
[KATSUKI]
You're dead.

00:20:21.262 --> 00:20:23.139 position:50% align:center
Just let me help you!

00:20:23.223 --> 00:20:25.058 position:50% align:center
You're the one who restored
the emergency power

00:20:25.141 --> 00:20:27.852 position:50% align:center
to save us earlier. Aren't you?

00:20:27.936 --> 00:20:29.854 position:50% align:center
To make it easier for
our friends to get out.

00:20:29.938 --> 00:20:31.439 position:50% align:center
Yeah, right!

00:20:31.523 --> 00:20:34.442 position:50% align:center
I just wanted to keep trying to
find that stupid training dummy.

00:20:34.526 --> 00:20:37.237 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] Then why did you stay
when everyone else left?

00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:39.572 position:50% align:center
You wanted to save
Todoroki, didn't you?

00:20:39.656 --> 00:20:41.074 position:50% align:center
Yeah, so I don't owe him.

00:20:41.157 --> 00:20:43.576 position:50% align:center
And me. You saved
me back there, too.

00:20:43.660 --> 00:20:46.204 position:50% align:center
Yes. He's right, Bakugo.

00:20:46.287 --> 00:20:50.166 position:50% align:center
You see? So please
let us help you now.

00:20:50.250 --> 00:20:51.960 position:50% align:center
To pay you back.

00:20:53.837 --> 00:20:55.130 position:50% align:center
In your dreams.

00:20:55.213 --> 00:20:56.798 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Please.

00:21:02.554 --> 00:21:05.223 position:50% align:center
You can be my cane!

00:21:05.306 --> 00:21:06.182 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:21:06.266 --> 00:21:07.392 position:50% align:center
[KATSUKI]
You heard me.

00:21:07.475 --> 00:21:10.061 position:50% align:center
Be my cane so I can
walk outta here myself.

00:21:10.145 --> 00:21:13.815 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] Oh, right, okay.
Sure. No problem.

00:21:13.898 --> 00:21:14.983 position:50% align:center
[KATSUKI]
Canes are silent!

00:21:15.066 --> 00:21:16.818 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] Sorry! Not
another peep, I swear!

00:21:16.901 --> 00:21:19.237 position:50% align:center
[KATSUKI] And you're
still talking, dammit!

00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:20.572 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU muffled grunting]

00:21:20.655 --> 00:21:22.198 position:50% align:center
I swear, if one more word
comes out of your mouth,

00:21:22.282 --> 00:21:24.367 position:50% align:center
I will explode you, got it?

00:21:26.036 --> 00:21:27.871 position:50% align:center
We're almost to
the surface now.

00:21:27.954 --> 00:21:28.705 position:50% align:center
Can you make it?

00:21:28.788 --> 00:21:29.998 position:50% align:center
Yeah, we're good.

00:21:30.081 --> 00:21:32.125 position:50% align:center
I said not to talk!

00:21:32.208 --> 00:21:33.209 position:50% align:center
Look! Yay!

00:21:33.293 --> 00:21:35.170 position:50% align:center
Hey!

00:21:36.588 --> 00:21:38.590 position:50% align:center
[AIZAWA] I will build
many walls in front of you

00:21:38.673 --> 00:21:42.635 position:50% align:center
in order to prepare you for
the provisional licensing exam.

00:21:42.719 --> 00:21:46.806 position:50% align:center
Break them down.
Overcome them.

00:21:46.890 --> 00:21:51.644 position:50% align:center
Go beyond. Plus Ultra.
