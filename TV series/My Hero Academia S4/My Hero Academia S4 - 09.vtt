The neurotoxin should
be circulating

00:00:13.722 --> 00:00:15.890 position:50% align:center
throughout your bodies
at this point.

00:00:15.974 --> 00:00:17.851 position:50% align:center
You're not gonna
die, but I doubt

00:00:17.934 --> 00:00:20.520 position:50% align:center
you'll be doing any
running for a while.

00:00:20.603 --> 00:00:23.314 position:50% align:center
Oh, and I'll be taking
these masks with me.

00:00:23.398 --> 00:00:24.441 position:50% align:center
Who knows what kinda tricks

00:00:24.524 --> 00:00:26.276 position:50% align:center
you might have
hidden inside them?

[AMAJIKI gasps]

00:00:28.403 --> 00:00:30.989 position:50% align:center
[AMAJIKI]
That took me too long.

00:00:31.072 --> 00:00:34.075 position:50% align:center
Wonder how far ahead
the others are now.

00:00:34.159 --> 00:00:37.078 position:50% align:center
I need to catch up.

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:39.706 position:50% align:center
[thud]

00:00:41.458 --> 00:00:47.005 position:50% align:center
[AMAJIKI] Huh. I guess I was
hurt worse than I thought.

00:02:17.512 --> 00:02:20.098 position:50% align:center
[POLICE, HEROES panting]

00:02:20.181 --> 00:02:22.475 position:50% align:center
[KIRISHIMA]
Oh, man. Amajiki.

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:25.895 position:50% align:center
I'm really worried about him.

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:28.231 position:50% align:center
[FATGUM] Not even the first
years think he can do this.

00:02:28.314 --> 00:02:30.233 position:50% align:center
Guess one moment of confidence
doesn't mean much

00:02:30.316 --> 00:02:31.526 position:50% align:center
if they haven't seen
him do anything

00:02:31.609 --> 00:02:33.653 position:50% align:center
to back it up, but still.

00:02:33.737 --> 00:02:34.863 position:50% align:center
Listen!

00:02:34.946 --> 00:02:36.448 position:50% align:center
You've left a comrade
to guard your back,

00:02:36.531 --> 00:02:38.408 position:50% align:center
and if you're a real man,
you'll trust him!

00:02:38.491 --> 00:02:40.160 position:50% align:center
Yeah, he'll handle
it, no problem!

00:02:40.243 --> 00:02:42.412 position:50% align:center
It doesn't take much to
change your mind, does it?

00:02:42.495 --> 00:02:44.664 position:50% align:center
[KIRISHIMA] Fat's right! All we
can do is have faith in him!

00:02:44.748 --> 00:02:46.166 position:50% align:center
[FATGUM] We can't afford
to waste a second

00:02:46.249 --> 00:02:48.043 position:50% align:center
of the time Suneater bought us!

00:02:48.126 --> 00:02:50.045 position:50% align:center
All right! Let's go!

00:02:50.128 --> 00:02:51.921 position:50% align:center
[LOCKLOCK]
Kid needs to calm down.

00:02:52.005 --> 00:02:54.090 position:50% align:center
[AIZAWA] Strange. The guy
who was manipulating

00:02:54.174 --> 00:02:56.551 position:50% align:center
the building seems to have
eased off for some reason.

00:02:56.634 --> 00:02:59.471 position:50% align:center
Yeah, you're right.
It's not twisting anymore.

00:02:59.554 --> 00:03:01.306 position:50% align:center
[AIZAWA] I'd expect him
to throw as many obstacles

00:03:01.389 --> 00:03:03.808 position:50% align:center
in our way as he
could to trip us up.

00:03:03.892 --> 00:03:05.769 position:50% align:center
If he's not, maybe that
means his awareness

00:03:05.852 --> 00:03:08.563 position:50% align:center
and control don't extend
through the entire place.

00:03:08.646 --> 00:03:10.857 position:50% align:center
There's also the police
squad up above.

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:13.443 position:50% align:center
It's possible he decided
to focus all his attention

00:03:13.526 --> 00:03:14.778 position:50% align:center
on them instead.

00:03:14.861 --> 00:03:15.904 position:50% align:center
So there's a limit to how much

00:03:15.987 --> 00:03:17.655 position:50% align:center
of the building
he can keep tabs on?

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:20.408 position:50% align:center
[AIZAWA] It's just a theory,
but maybe rather than having

00:03:20.492 --> 00:03:23.286 position:50% align:center
been assimilated into it,
he's moving around inside

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.663 position:50% align:center
the walls to monitor
what's going on.

00:03:25.747 --> 00:03:28.249 position:50% align:center
So when he does take
control of an area,

00:03:28.333 --> 00:03:30.710 position:50% align:center
perhaps his true body is nearby.

00:03:30.794 --> 00:03:33.880 position:50% align:center
[MIMIC] They only managed
to stop one of the heroes?

00:03:33.963 --> 00:03:37.467 position:50% align:center
Garbage or not, those three
are supposed to be strong.

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:39.427 position:50% align:center
[AIZAWA] If he pokes an
actual eye or an ear out

00:03:39.511 --> 00:03:41.888 position:50% align:center
to keep track of us,
that'll be all it takes.

00:03:41.971 --> 00:03:43.807 position:50% align:center
[MIMIC gasps]
That's right.

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:45.642 position:50% align:center
[AIZAWA]
I just need to see him.

00:03:45.725 --> 00:03:47.519 position:50% align:center
[MIMIC]
It's his fault!

00:03:49.854 --> 00:03:51.147 position:50% align:center
[BUBBLE GIRL]
I can't believe you all came out

00:03:51.231 --> 00:03:54.109 position:50% align:center
to try and stop us.
It seems crazy to me.

00:03:54.192 --> 00:03:55.402 position:50% align:center
[HASSAIKAI MEMBER 71E]
Well, it's not.

00:03:55.485 --> 00:03:58.530 position:50% align:center
Fighting you people was
the only sane option.

00:03:58.613 --> 00:04:00.740 position:50% align:center
We couldn't just sit it out.

00:04:00.824 --> 00:04:04.452 position:50% align:center
If we did, Overhaul would've
killed us without a thought.

00:04:04.536 --> 00:04:07.288 position:50% align:center
Overhaul. You're
talking about Chisaki?

00:04:07.372 --> 00:04:08.957 position:50% align:center
[HASSAIKAI MEMBER 71E] Yeah,
it's what he started callin'

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:13.336 position:50% align:center
himself after the boss got
sick and he came to power.

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:15.338 position:50% align:center
The boss valued the old ways.

00:04:15.422 --> 00:04:17.674 position:50% align:center
He wanted the yakuza
to stay as we were,

00:04:17.757 --> 00:04:19.718 position:50% align:center
even in these new times.

00:04:19.801 --> 00:04:23.388 position:50% align:center
We're not like villains;
the Hassaikai have integrity.

00:04:23.471 --> 00:04:25.473 position:50% align:center
He didn't want us to
be seen as just another

00:04:25.557 --> 00:04:27.600 position:50% align:center
group of low-life thugs.

00:04:27.684 --> 00:04:30.478 position:50% align:center
He's who we respected.
We trusted him.

00:04:30.562 --> 00:04:32.605 position:50% align:center
The young head gave
himself a villain's name.

00:04:32.689 --> 00:04:34.315 position:50% align:center
Allowed scum to join us.

00:04:34.399 --> 00:04:35.859 position:50% align:center
He makes decisions on his own,

00:04:35.942 --> 00:04:37.652 position:50% align:center
doesn't care what
the rest of us want.

00:04:37.736 --> 00:04:40.030 position:50% align:center
Thinks he's the only one
whose vote matters.

00:04:40.113 --> 00:04:41.614 position:50% align:center
The boss's in bad shape.

00:04:41.698 --> 00:04:43.408 position:50% align:center
Can't even talk, and
we know who to blame.

00:04:43.491 --> 00:04:44.617 position:50% align:center
Watch it.

00:04:44.701 --> 00:04:46.327 position:50% align:center
As much as you dislike Chisaki,

00:04:46.411 --> 00:04:48.788 position:50% align:center
you seem pretty sure that
we're not gonna catch him.

00:04:48.872 --> 00:04:50.749 position:50% align:center
[HASSAIKAI MEMBER 71D]
You don't stand a chance.

00:04:50.832 --> 00:04:52.167 position:50% align:center
Whackjob like him?

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:55.003 position:50% align:center
Doesn't care about consequences
or even his own future?

00:04:55.086 --> 00:04:57.047 position:50% align:center
Those are the ones you
have to watch out for.

00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:59.591 position:50% align:center
It's what makes
them so dangerous.

knock me out of the fight

00:05:05.764 --> 00:05:07.932 position:50% align:center

can't handle their job,

00:05:10.226 --> 00:05:12.937 position:50% align:center

care of these guys myself!

00:05:13.021 --> 00:05:14.189 position:50% align:center

No!

00:05:14.272 --> 00:05:15.482 position:50% align:center
[FATGUM]
If we don't stop this guy,

00:05:15.565 --> 00:05:17.776 position:50% align:center
then Tamaki will've
stayed behind for nothing.

00:05:17.859 --> 00:05:21.613 position:50% align:center
Come on, Eraser,
time to do your thing!

00:05:21.696 --> 00:05:23.239 position:50% align:center

Where'd you come from?

00:05:32.999 --> 00:05:35.585 position:50% align:center
I jumped out in
front of Mr. Aizawa.

00:05:36.586 --> 00:05:38.296 position:50% align:center
[KIRISHIMA] I figured I
wouldn't take any damage.

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:42.425 position:50% align:center
But then you jumped
and I kinda got stuck.

00:05:42.509 --> 00:05:47.389 position:50% align:center
Well, nothin' we can do now.
Get ready. We're not alone.

00:05:52.769 --> 00:05:54.729 position:50% align:center

Go ahead, punch me.

00:05:56.189 --> 00:05:58.733 position:50% align:center

You know what I think?

Knives and guns got
no place in a fight.

00:06:28.388 --> 00:06:30.390 position:50% align:center
Anyone can win if
they got a weapon.

00:06:30.473 --> 00:06:31.933 position:50% align:center
That's the coward's way.

00:06:32.017 --> 00:06:34.060 position:50% align:center
A real fighter kills
his opponent using

00:06:34.144 --> 00:06:36.479 position:50% align:center
nothing but his own strength.

00:06:36.563 --> 00:06:38.314 position:50% align:center
You a real fighter?

What?

00:06:50.076 --> 00:06:52.495 position:50% align:center

Looks like some kinda barrier.

00:06:52.579 --> 00:06:54.247 position:50% align:center
[TENGAI]
So, we have Fatgum and a boy

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:56.416 position:50% align:center
with a hardening Quirk.

00:06:56.499 --> 00:07:00.128 position:50% align:center
Mm... They're both better
suited for defense.

00:07:00.211 --> 00:07:02.505 position:50% align:center
Disappointing, isn't it, Rappa?

00:07:02.589 --> 00:07:03.673 position:50% align:center

[groans]

00:07:08.345 --> 00:07:11.014 position:50% align:center
[FATGUM] I can feel his
blows even through my fat.

00:07:11.097 --> 00:07:13.433 position:50% align:center
Each punch is like a bullet.

00:07:13.516 --> 00:07:15.060 position:50% align:center
[RAPPA]
You call that a good defense?

00:07:15.143 --> 00:07:16.811 position:50% align:center
They're both lookin'
rough already.

00:07:16.895 --> 00:07:20.190 position:50% align:center
I mean, they're not
mincemeat yet, but still.

00:07:20.273 --> 00:07:22.817 position:50% align:center
[FATGUM] These two weren't
on the Quirk list we got.

00:07:22.901 --> 00:07:24.778 position:50% align:center
Did they bring in outside help?

00:07:24.861 --> 00:07:27.822 position:50% align:center
One makes a barrier and the
other rains down punches.

00:07:27.906 --> 00:07:30.075 position:50% align:center
This'll be a tricky
pair to fight.

00:07:30.158 --> 00:07:32.327 position:50% align:center
[TENGAI]
We are a spear and a shield.

00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:34.662 position:50% align:center
Whereas you are
simply two shields.

00:07:34.746 --> 00:07:35.955 position:50% align:center
[RAPPA]
Wait, hold on.

00:07:36.039 --> 00:07:39.709 position:50% align:center
Who'd wanna fight with
two shields? Sounds lame.

00:07:39.793 --> 00:07:42.379 position:50% align:center
[TENGAI] To be fair,
I don't know whether that boy

00:07:42.462 --> 00:07:45.173 position:50% align:center
even qualifies as one.

00:07:45.256 --> 00:07:48.551 position:50% align:center
[KIRISHIMA]
My arms cracked. Man, it hurts.

00:07:48.635 --> 00:07:50.720 position:50% align:center
I couldn't absorb the blow.

00:07:50.804 --> 00:07:53.890 position:50% align:center
Another barrage like
that, and I'm done.

00:07:53.973 --> 00:07:56.309 position:50% align:center
I thought I'd gotten stronger.

00:07:56.393 --> 00:07:59.729 position:50% align:center
Damn it! I'm still weak.

00:08:01.272 --> 00:08:02.565 position:50% align:center

Remember, you're unbreakable!

[KIRISHIMA gasps]

00:08:03.650 --> 00:08:04.734 position:50% align:center
If you let them
break your spirit,

00:08:04.818 --> 00:08:05.860 position:50% align:center
that means you've lost!

00:08:05.944 --> 00:08:07.278 position:50% align:center
When you're up against villains,

00:08:07.362 --> 00:08:09.447 position:50% align:center
the key is making 'em lose
their will to fight first!

00:08:09.531 --> 00:08:12.450 position:50% align:center
You can't lose your
drive before they do!

00:08:12.534 --> 00:08:13.952 position:50% align:center
Now, let's take
those two fatheads

00:08:14.035 --> 00:08:15.286 position:50% align:center
down and get outta here.

00:08:15.370 --> 00:08:17.622 position:50% align:center
The others are waitin' for us!

00:08:17.706 --> 00:08:19.624 position:50% align:center
[TENGAI]
They believe they can defeat us.

00:08:19.708 --> 00:08:21.376 position:50% align:center
You must be thrilled.

00:08:21.459 --> 00:08:23.670 position:50% align:center
[RAPPA] I like the way
that fat guy thinks!

00:08:23.753 --> 00:08:25.922 position:50% align:center
All right. This is
startin' to get good.

00:08:26.006 --> 00:08:28.174 position:50% align:center

Remember what
Master Overhaul said.

00:08:35.932 --> 00:08:37.559 position:50% align:center
He paired us for a reason.

00:08:37.642 --> 00:08:40.854 position:50% align:center

other, ensuring victory.

such violence will accomplish?

00:08:47.902 --> 00:08:50.697 position:50% align:center
[RAPPA] Overhaul didn't ask if
I wanted to team up with you.

[TENGAI] "Master Overhaul."
Show some respect.

Very well.

take them yourself,

That's more like it.

You're not so bad after all!

00:09:08.631 --> 00:09:11.509 position:50% align:center
[FATGUM] When I get in close,
I can't dodge his hits.

00:09:11.593 --> 00:09:13.011 position:50% align:center
And there's so much
strength behind them

00:09:13.094 --> 00:09:15.388 position:50% align:center
that not even I can
absorb all the damage.

00:09:15.472 --> 00:09:18.224 position:50% align:center

I've got nothin' left.

before, but I'm sure

the other guy'll put up a shield
if his partner needs one.

00:09:23.688 --> 00:09:26.316 position:50% align:center
It felt like an iron wall
when I punched it earlier.

Despite what I said,
Kirishima's in rough shape

00:09:36.159 --> 00:09:37.660 position:50% align:center
But I've got no choice.

00:09:37.744 --> 00:09:41.081 position:50% align:center
I have to face them. Get this
wrong, and I might die.

Your name's Rappa, right?

00:09:47.837 --> 00:09:50.465 position:50% align:center
It's been a while since
I've been hit that hard.

00:09:50.548 --> 00:09:53.927 position:50% align:center
And I've done a decent amount
of fighting over the years, too.

00:09:54.010 --> 00:09:55.428 position:50% align:center
In the end, it's all
gonna come down

00:09:55.512 --> 00:09:56.638 position:50% align:center
to what happens first.

00:09:56.721 --> 00:09:59.349 position:50% align:center
Your arms get tired
or my body gives out.

00:09:59.432 --> 00:10:02.268 position:50% align:center
Which is stronger?
Spear or shield?

00:10:02.352 --> 00:10:04.646 position:50% align:center
I guess we're about to
find out, aren't we?

00:10:04.729 --> 00:10:07.399 position:50% align:center
[RAPPA] All right! You
totally get me, Fatso!

00:10:07.482 --> 00:10:08.733 position:50% align:center
Tengai, remember.

00:10:08.817 --> 00:10:09.984 position:50% align:center
[TENGAI]
No barriers.

00:10:10.068 --> 00:10:13.947 position:50% align:center

gonna be awesome, guys!

00:10:14.030 --> 00:10:17.283 position:50% align:center

Fat. He's protecting me.

00:10:17.367 --> 00:10:19.160 position:50% align:center
Even though those
punches are obviously

00:10:19.244 --> 00:10:21.246 position:50% align:center
wearing him down.

00:10:21.329 --> 00:10:23.456 position:50% align:center
What is wrong with me?

00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:27.085 position:50% align:center
I was so sure I'd gotten
stronger! But then...

00:10:27.168 --> 00:10:28.670 position:50% align:center
He broke through
my ultimate move

00:10:28.753 --> 00:10:33.591 position:50% align:center
with a single attack.
And now I'm just in the way.

00:10:33.675 --> 00:10:36.261 position:50% align:center
[FATGUM] He keeps getting
faster and each hit hurts

00:10:36.344 --> 00:10:37.595 position:50% align:center
worse than the last.

hold out long enough?

off really quickly.

just have to spend them

it doesn't matter
what your Quirk is.

Train your body as
hard as you can

00:13:21.343 --> 00:13:24.846 position:50% align:center

for your Quirk's weakness!

what I thought.

What if I had a flashier Quirk?

00:13:55.210 --> 00:13:56.961 position:50% align:center

[KIRISHIMA] In the spring,
guy the same age as me

00:15:32.557 --> 00:15:35.977 position:50% align:center
was in the news for fighting
back against a villain.

00:15:36.061 --> 00:15:38.480 position:50% align:center
Everyone was talking about him,

00:15:38.563 --> 00:15:40.607 position:50% align:center
but there were witnesses
who said that just before

00:15:40.690 --> 00:15:44.569 position:50% align:center
All Might showed up, another
kid--his friend, maybe--

00:15:44.652 --> 00:15:47.322 position:50% align:center
rushed in to help.

00:15:47.405 --> 00:15:50.283 position:50% align:center
My spirit's not making
up for anything.

00:15:50.367 --> 00:15:52.243 position:50% align:center
When you're really scared...

00:15:52.327 --> 00:15:54.871 position:50% align:center
When your life is
really on the line...

00:15:54.954 --> 00:15:57.624 position:50% align:center
That's when your
true colors show.

00:15:57.707 --> 00:16:00.251 position:50% align:center
Facing danger,
and choosing to take

00:16:00.335 --> 00:16:02.754 position:50% align:center
that next step forward,
that's what makes

00:16:02.837 --> 00:16:06.091 position:50% align:center
a person hero material.

00:16:06.174 --> 00:16:09.969 position:50% align:center
I'm not a hero.
I'm not even a man.

00:16:11.513 --> 00:16:13.056 position:50% align:center
[KIRISHIMA] My mom told
me that the first time

00:16:13.139 --> 00:16:16.434 position:50% align:center
my Quirk appeared,
I accidentally cut my eye.

00:16:16.518 --> 00:16:19.187 position:50% align:center
For a while after that,
I whined and cried about

00:16:19.270 --> 00:16:22.482 position:50% align:center
how much I hated my power.

00:16:22.565 --> 00:16:24.567 position:50% align:center
Thinking about it now,
that's probably

00:16:24.651 --> 00:16:27.195 position:50% align:center
why I admired him so much.

00:16:27.278 --> 00:16:30.782 position:50% align:center
I hated my own Quirk,
but his was similar.

00:16:30.865 --> 00:16:34.285 position:50% align:center
He stood tall and risked
his life to save others.

00:16:37.914 --> 00:16:39.332 position:50% align:center
[CRIMSON RIOT]
That's not it, is it?

00:16:39.416 --> 00:16:41.626 position:50% align:center
--[KIRISHIMA gasps]
--[MC 72A] No, I'm sorry!

00:16:41.710 --> 00:16:44.421 position:50% align:center
[KIRISHIMA] Oh. That came
with a book on great heroes

00:16:44.504 --> 00:16:48.049 position:50% align:center
I got for my birthday
a while ago.

00:16:48.133 --> 00:16:50.468 position:50% align:center
Guess I never got
around to watching it.

00:16:50.552 --> 00:16:52.303 position:50% align:center
[MC 72A] If you're ready,
we'll start the interview.

00:16:52.387 --> 00:16:54.055 position:50% align:center
[CRIMSON RIOT]
Right, hit me!

00:16:54.139 --> 00:16:56.266 position:50% align:center
[MC 72A] Even among heroes,
you have a reputation

00:16:56.349 --> 00:16:58.268 position:50% align:center
for being a bit... reckless,

00:16:58.351 --> 00:17:00.645 position:50% align:center
often rushing
headlong into danger.

00:17:00.729 --> 00:17:03.898 position:50% align:center
Tell me, are you ever
afraid in those situations?

00:17:03.982 --> 00:17:05.775 position:50% align:center
[CRIMSON RIOT]
What kind of question is that?

00:17:05.859 --> 00:17:08.653 position:50% align:center
Of course I'm afraid!

00:17:08.737 --> 00:17:11.531 position:50% align:center
Show me somebody who's not
afraid of facing death,

00:17:11.614 --> 00:17:13.908 position:50% align:center
and I'll show you an idiot!

00:17:13.992 --> 00:17:16.953 position:50% align:center
[KIRISHIMA] I never understood
what he was about before.

00:17:17.037 --> 00:17:18.913 position:50% align:center
Not really, anyway.

00:17:18.997 --> 00:17:20.373 position:50% align:center
I just thought he was cool

00:17:20.457 --> 00:17:23.209 position:50% align:center
for charging full-force
into everything.

00:17:23.293 --> 00:17:24.711 position:50% align:center
[CRIMSON RIOT]
I'm where I am now because

00:17:24.794 --> 00:17:28.423 position:50% align:center
when I was a sidekick, I failed
to save someone in peril.

00:17:28.506 --> 00:17:31.051 position:50% align:center
[MC 72A] I heard about that,
but it wasn't your fault.

00:17:31.134 --> 00:17:32.719 position:50% align:center
With the crime rate as
high as it is, there's--

00:17:32.802 --> 00:17:35.221 position:50% align:center
[CRIMSON RIOT]
I don't think you understand.

00:17:35.305 --> 00:17:38.516 position:50% align:center
That day, I hesitated,
and somebody lost their life

00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:40.602 position:50% align:center
because my spirit was weak.

00:17:40.685 --> 00:17:42.687 position:50% align:center
Yes, I'm frightened
when I fight a villain,

00:17:42.771 --> 00:17:44.606 position:50% align:center
knowing it could
end in my death.

00:17:44.689 --> 00:17:47.567 position:50% align:center
But there's something
I fear more.

00:17:47.650 --> 00:17:50.111 position:50% align:center
The look on someone's
face as they die.

00:17:50.195 --> 00:17:52.238 position:50% align:center
That's far worse.

00:17:52.322 --> 00:17:55.700 position:50% align:center
It's the fear of seeing that
look again that drives me.

00:17:55.784 --> 00:17:58.328 position:50% align:center
[MC 72A] Can you tell me
what chivalry means to you?

00:17:58.411 --> 00:18:00.288 position:50% align:center
[CRIMSON RIOT]
Having a strong spirit.

00:18:00.372 --> 00:18:04.751 position:50% align:center
It isn't a matter of being bold,
or confident, or fearless.

00:18:04.834 --> 00:18:07.921 position:50% align:center
I'm a hero and I've
sworn to protect people.

00:18:08.004 --> 00:18:11.383 position:50% align:center
It's a vow I've written on my
heart and one I'll die to keep.

00:18:11.466 --> 00:18:14.344 position:50% align:center
You want to know what
chivalry means to me?

00:18:14.427 --> 00:18:17.722 position:50% align:center
Living a life with no regrets.

00:18:17.806 --> 00:18:19.057 position:50% align:center
[FRIEND 72A]
You serious, E?

00:18:19.140 --> 00:18:21.726 position:50% align:center
[KIRISHIMA]
Yeah, I am.

00:18:21.810 --> 00:18:25.897 position:50% align:center
[KIRISHIMA] I won't freeze
like that again. Ever.

00:18:25.980 --> 00:18:27.190 position:50% align:center
[KIRISHIMA]
I'm sorry!

00:18:27.273 --> 00:18:29.567 position:50% align:center
I saw that guy threatening
you, but I panicked.

00:18:29.651 --> 00:18:31.611 position:50% align:center
I was too scared to move.

00:18:31.695 --> 00:18:33.488 position:50% align:center
Um. Who is he?

00:18:33.571 --> 00:18:35.407 position:50% align:center
Pretty sure he's in Class 1.

00:18:35.490 --> 00:18:36.616 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT 72A]
Don't worry about it.

00:18:36.700 --> 00:18:37.867 position:50% align:center
Anyone would be scared.

00:18:37.951 --> 00:18:40.078 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT 72B]
Mina's just special, that's all.

00:18:41.371 --> 00:18:42.622 position:50% align:center
[KIRISHIMA grunts]

00:18:56.720 --> 00:19:00.098 position:50% align:center
[screams] What is up
with that hair?

00:19:00.181 --> 00:19:01.558 position:50% align:center
Get a new look for high school?

00:19:01.641 --> 00:19:03.018 position:50% align:center
You've got horns, like me!

00:19:03.101 --> 00:19:05.979 position:50% align:center
[KIRISHIMA]
Yeah! So what if I do?

00:19:06.062 --> 00:19:08.398 position:50% align:center
I'm not gonna regret
stuff anymore.

00:19:08.481 --> 00:19:12.027 position:50% align:center
Not ever! I'll protect
people, like a hero!

00:19:12.110 --> 00:19:14.821 position:50% align:center
I'm not the pathetic
loser I used to be!

00:19:17.782 --> 00:19:20.201 position:50% align:center
[ASHIDO] What happened
that day, with the villain.

00:19:20.285 --> 00:19:21.828 position:50% align:center
It was really tough on you.

00:19:21.911 --> 00:19:24.164 position:50% align:center
More than it was on us.

00:19:24.247 --> 00:19:26.750 position:50% align:center
So? What's it to you?

00:19:26.833 --> 00:19:28.335 position:50% align:center
[ASHIDO] Don't be too eager
to change who you are!

00:19:28.418 --> 00:19:29.502 position:50% align:center
That hurts!

00:19:29.586 --> 00:19:32.797 position:50% align:center
Actually, it doesn't,
but what the heck?

00:19:32.881 --> 00:19:34.924 position:50% align:center
Once you get over yourself
let me know, okay?

00:19:35.008 --> 00:19:36.968 position:50% align:center
I'm being nice and
holding back for now.

00:19:37.052 --> 00:19:38.636 position:50% align:center
But someday I'm
gonna tell everyone

00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:42.682 position:50% align:center
about your little
makeover. He, he, he!

00:19:42.766 --> 00:19:44.351 position:50% align:center
Thank you.

00:19:48.897 --> 00:19:51.816 position:50% align:center
[KIRISHIMA] I've been in a ton
of scary situations since then.

00:19:51.900 --> 00:19:53.193 position:50% align:center
But one thing's
always frightened me

00:19:53.276 --> 00:19:56.196 position:50% align:center
more than anything else.

00:19:56.279 --> 00:19:57.572 position:50% align:center
[groans]

00:19:57.655 --> 00:19:58.615 position:50% align:center
[RAPPA]
You're kidding, right?

00:19:58.698 --> 00:20:00.408 position:50% align:center
How are you still standing?

00:20:00.492 --> 00:20:02.702 position:50% align:center
[FATGUM]
You think I'm just a shield,

00:20:02.786 --> 00:20:05.663 position:50% align:center
and that mistake's gonna
cost you this fight.

00:20:05.747 --> 00:20:08.083 position:50% align:center
I've been absorbing
every blow you dealt me,

00:20:08.166 --> 00:20:11.503 position:50% align:center
sinking each one into my
body and storing its power.

00:20:11.586 --> 00:20:13.713 position:50% align:center
Doing that takes energy
and burns the fat

00:20:13.797 --> 00:20:16.466 position:50% align:center
that protects me from
taking serious damage.

00:20:16.549 --> 00:20:20.303 position:50% align:center
So my defense is getting weaker,
but I'll take those punches,

00:20:20.387 --> 00:20:24.641 position:50% align:center
and forge a spear that
can shatter any shield!

00:20:24.724 --> 00:20:26.726 position:50% align:center
[TENGAI]
Rappa! He's up to something!

00:20:26.810 --> 00:20:28.353 position:50% align:center
Finish him, quickly!

00:20:28.436 --> 00:20:30.188 position:50% align:center
[FATGUM]
It's time to strike.

00:20:30.271 --> 00:20:32.649 position:50% align:center
But he's worn me down
more than I expected.

00:20:32.732 --> 00:20:35.735 position:50% align:center
Not sure I'm ready to unleash
the power I've absorbed!

00:20:35.819 --> 00:20:36.820 position:50% align:center
[RAPPA]
Show me what you've got!

00:20:36.903 --> 00:20:38.863 position:50% align:center
Don't hold anything back!

00:20:41.032 --> 00:20:42.409 position:50% align:center
Red!

00:20:42.492 --> 00:20:46.329 position:50% align:center
[KIRISHIMA] I won't regret
anything! Now or ever again!

00:20:46.413 --> 00:20:49.833 position:50% align:center
[KIRISHIMA]
I'll do it. I'll become a hero.

00:20:49.916 --> 00:20:53.169 position:50% align:center
I'll protect people!

00:20:53.253 --> 00:20:55.547 position:50% align:center
[RAPPA] He was blown away
so easily earlier!

00:20:55.630 --> 00:20:58.008 position:50% align:center
[KIRISHIMA] If I crack,
then I'll harden again!

00:20:58.091 --> 00:21:00.552 position:50% align:center
Stay strong! Protect others!

00:21:00.635 --> 00:21:02.554 position:50% align:center
Even if it means your life!

00:21:02.637 --> 00:21:04.597 position:50% align:center
All right, kid! Let's go!

00:21:04.681 --> 00:21:07.058 position:50% align:center
[yells]

00:21:08.476 --> 00:21:09.644 position:50% align:center
A shield, now?

00:21:09.728 --> 00:21:12.022 position:50% align:center
[TENGAI]
Of course. Don't be a fool.

00:21:12.105 --> 00:21:14.733 position:50% align:center
Nothing can overcome the
strength of my defense.

00:21:14.816 --> 00:21:16.901 position:50% align:center
The boy's attack was in vain.

00:21:16.985 --> 00:21:18.945 position:50% align:center
[FATGUM]
It wasn't in vain!

00:21:19.029 --> 00:21:19.946 position:50% align:center
[TENGAI gasps]

00:21:20.030 --> 00:21:22.240 position:50% align:center
[FATGUM]
Thank you, Red!

00:21:22.323 --> 00:21:23.908 position:50% align:center
You bought me the time I needed!

00:21:23.992 --> 00:21:25.785 position:50% align:center
Tengai! Take this thing down!

00:21:25.869 --> 00:21:27.245 position:50% align:center
The two of you are gonna lose.

00:21:27.328 --> 00:21:28.955 position:50% align:center
Do you wanna know why?

00:21:29.039 --> 00:21:30.206 position:50% align:center
[TENGAI]
My wall will stand!

00:21:30.290 --> 00:21:31.416 position:50% align:center
[RAPPA]
I'm not so sure.

00:21:31.499 --> 00:21:33.793 position:50% align:center
[FATGUM] You made a
mistake. And so did I.

00:21:33.877 --> 00:21:36.755 position:50% align:center
We underestimated the
hero named Red Riot,

00:21:36.838 --> 00:21:40.342 position:50% align:center
and his chivalrous spirit!

00:21:52.979 --> 00:21:57.650 position:50% align:center
A spear and a shield.
The victory is ours.

00:23:29.701 --> 00:23:31.244 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Here's the preview!

00:23:31.327 --> 00:23:33.997 position:50% align:center
We're moving as quickly
as we can to save Eri,

00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:35.915 position:50% align:center
but Hassakai's Irinaka
used his Quirk

00:23:35.999 --> 00:23:38.460 position:50% align:center
to trap us in
an underground maze.

00:23:38.543 --> 00:23:40.170 position:50% align:center
Ururaka and the others.

00:23:40.253 --> 00:23:43.048 position:50% align:center
Amajaki. Kirishima.

00:23:43.131 --> 00:23:45.425 position:50% align:center
They've given their all
to get us this far.

00:23:45.508 --> 00:23:48.219 position:50% align:center
I won't let the
Hassakai stop us now!

00:23:48.303 --> 00:23:50.388 position:50% align:center
Next time: "Temp Squad."

00:23:50.472 --> 00:23:53.308 position:50% align:center
Wait, what are these
guys doing here?

00:23:53.391 --> 00:23:56.102 position:50% align:center
Go beyond. Plus Ultra!
