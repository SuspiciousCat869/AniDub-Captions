00:00:11.469 --> 00:00:13.930 position:50% align:center
[KURONO]
Finally. We've succeeded.

00:00:14.014 --> 00:00:19.811 position:50% align:center
[CHISAKI] Yes. A permanent
version of the drug.

00:00:19.894 --> 00:00:22.188 position:50% align:center
We finally figured
out how to preserve

00:00:22.272 --> 00:00:24.858 position:50% align:center
Eri's power. With this,

00:00:24.941 --> 00:00:27.736 position:50% align:center
we can completely
annihilate a Quirk.

00:00:27.819 --> 00:00:32.157 position:50% align:center
It's a cure. Now we
can fix this world.

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:33.742 position:50% align:center
[KURONO]
But the process is expensive

00:00:33.825 --> 00:00:35.535 position:50% align:center
and takes far too long.

00:00:35.618 --> 00:00:38.621 position:50% align:center
Took us an entire month
to create five bullets.

00:00:38.705 --> 00:00:42.417 position:50% align:center
[CHISAKI] Because we're doing
it ourselves, down here.

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.670 position:50% align:center
I'll find a more
suitable environment.

00:00:45.754 --> 00:00:49.299 position:50% align:center
Now's our chance.
With All For One gone,

00:00:49.382 --> 00:00:51.551 position:50% align:center
we don't have time to waste.

00:02:22.058 --> 00:02:24.728 position:50% align:center
My name's Toga and I was
told I had to come here.

00:02:24.811 --> 00:02:26.021 position:50% align:center
Hiya.

00:02:26.104 --> 00:02:29.482 position:50% align:center
[TWICE] Long time no see,
birdman. Be warned.

00:02:29.566 --> 00:02:33.445 position:50% align:center
I'll never forgive you.
So happy to be on the team!

00:02:33.528 --> 00:02:35.030 position:50% align:center
[CHISAKI]
Wonderful.

00:02:35.113 --> 00:02:37.532 position:50% align:center
[RAPPA] The League of Villains?
This is perfect. Let's brawl!

00:02:37.615 --> 00:02:38.575 position:50% align:center
[TWICE]
I'll kill you.

00:02:38.658 --> 00:02:40.577 position:50% align:center
[TOGA]
Yeah, no thanks.

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:43.288 position:50% align:center
[CHISAKI] Sorry about
the whole Magne thing.

00:02:43.371 --> 00:02:45.915 position:50% align:center
It's unfortunate.
I didn't wanna kill him.

00:02:45.999 --> 00:02:46.958 position:50% align:center
[TWICE]
You mean her.

00:02:47.042 --> 00:02:49.753 position:50% align:center
Don't make that mistake again.

00:02:49.836 --> 00:02:52.672 position:50% align:center
[CHISAKI] Anyway, this is
no time to be holding

00:02:52.756 --> 00:02:55.842 position:50% align:center
grudges against each other.
We're on the same team now.

00:02:55.925 --> 00:02:58.261 position:50% align:center
I want your help with my plan.

00:02:58.345 --> 00:03:00.889 position:50% align:center
[TWICE] Bastard. You
tried to play it cool

00:03:00.972 --> 00:03:02.682 position:50% align:center
the first time we met, too!

00:03:02.766 --> 00:03:05.643 position:50% align:center
Like you don't care
about anything!

00:03:05.727 --> 00:03:07.812 position:50% align:center
So, what are my orders?

00:03:07.896 --> 00:03:10.357 position:50% align:center
[CHISAKI] Just follow my
instructions like everyone else

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:13.276 position:50% align:center
in the organization.
But first things first.

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.528 position:50% align:center
I want the details
of your Quirks.

00:03:15.612 --> 00:03:17.405 position:50% align:center
It'll be easier for us
to work together

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:19.908 position:50% align:center
if I fully understand
what you can do.

00:03:19.991 --> 00:03:21.493 position:50% align:center
I think I'll tell you
about my powers

00:03:21.576 --> 00:03:23.328 position:50% align:center
when you need to
know about them.

00:03:23.411 --> 00:03:26.915 position:50% align:center
Oh, and just so we're clear:
I still don't like you people.

00:03:26.998 --> 00:03:29.292 position:50% align:center
[MIMIC] So much for making
a good impression.

00:03:29.376 --> 00:03:31.586 position:50% align:center
Don't underestimate the yakuza!

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:33.213 position:50% align:center
[MIMIC yells]

00:03:35.298 --> 00:03:36.549 position:50% align:center
[TWICE]
I agree with Toga.

00:03:36.633 --> 00:03:38.468 position:50% align:center
We'll tell you when
we feel like it.

00:03:38.551 --> 00:03:39.969 position:50% align:center
Won't get nothing outta me.

00:03:40.053 --> 00:03:42.305 position:50% align:center
No way. My lips are sealed.

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:44.724 position:50% align:center
[NEMOTO]
What is your Quirk?

00:03:44.808 --> 00:03:46.601 position:50% align:center
[TWICE]
I can make doubles of anything.

00:03:46.685 --> 00:03:49.312 position:50% align:center
For it to work, I need a
precise image in my head.

00:03:49.396 --> 00:03:51.731 position:50% align:center
Yup! That means height,
chest measurement,

00:03:51.815 --> 00:03:54.734 position:50% align:center
and shoe size if it's a person,
you name it, I need it.

00:03:54.818 --> 00:03:56.528 position:50% align:center
Gotta have as much
info as possible.

00:03:56.611 --> 00:03:59.030 position:50% align:center
Only then can I make
one thing into two.

00:03:59.114 --> 00:04:00.365 position:50% align:center
The main difference
between the doubles

00:04:00.448 --> 00:04:02.242 position:50% align:center
and the real thing
is durability.

00:04:02.325 --> 00:04:04.911 position:50% align:center
They just kinda melt if they're
knocked around too much.

00:04:04.994 --> 00:04:07.247 position:50% align:center
I can make doubles of up
to two things at once.

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:09.874 position:50% align:center
The damage the second object
can take is even lower.

00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:11.334 position:50% align:center
Also, for personal reasons,

00:04:11.418 --> 00:04:14.170 position:50% align:center
I refuse to make copies
of myself. Got it?

00:04:18.258 --> 00:04:19.968 position:50% align:center
[TWICE]
Huh? What just happened?

00:04:20.051 --> 00:04:22.387 position:50% align:center
It's like I couldn't stop
the words from coming.

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:24.139 position:50% align:center
Wow, that was pretty stupid.

00:04:24.222 --> 00:04:26.224 position:50% align:center
[TWICE]
It wasn't me, Toga! I swear!

00:04:26.307 --> 00:04:27.600 position:50% align:center
[NEMOTO]
And you?

00:04:27.684 --> 00:04:30.562 position:50% align:center
If I drink someone's blood,
I can turn into them.

00:04:30.645 --> 00:04:32.564 position:50% align:center
Whatever I take in
turns into energy,

00:04:32.647 --> 00:04:35.859 position:50% align:center
so the more I drink, the longer
I can hold onto the form.

00:04:35.942 --> 00:04:37.944 position:50% align:center
One cup lets me look
and sound like someone

00:04:38.028 --> 00:04:39.320 position:50% align:center
for about a day.

00:04:39.404 --> 00:04:41.031 position:50% align:center
Plus, if I drink a buncha
different people's blood

00:04:41.114 --> 00:04:43.616 position:50% align:center
at the same time, I can
turn into any of them!

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:46.077 position:50% align:center
I can recreate
their clothes, too.

00:04:46.161 --> 00:04:47.537 position:50% align:center
But they get layered
under my own,

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:49.664 position:50% align:center
so it helps to get naked
before I transform,

00:04:49.748 --> 00:04:52.459 position:50% align:center
which can be a little
embarrassing sometimes.

00:04:55.503 --> 00:04:56.880 position:50% align:center
[TWICE]
See?

00:04:56.963 --> 00:04:59.257 position:50% align:center
[NEMOTO]
One more thing.

00:04:59.341 --> 00:05:03.011 position:50% align:center
Did Shigaraki say anything
about betraying us?

00:05:04.888 --> 00:05:07.349 position:50% align:center
--[TWICE] Nope!
--[TOGA] No.

00:05:07.432 --> 00:05:08.725 position:50% align:center
[CHISAKI]
Okay, then.

00:05:08.808 --> 00:05:11.686 position:50% align:center
I'll accept you as members
of the Hassaikai now.

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:16.232 position:50% align:center
But wanted criminals like you
need to stay out of sight.

00:05:16.316 --> 00:05:17.984 position:50% align:center
Unless I say otherwise,

00:05:18.068 --> 00:05:20.070 position:50% align:center
don't leave the
underground facilities.

00:05:20.153 --> 00:05:20.904 position:50% align:center
[TWICE]
House arrest?

00:05:20.987 --> 00:05:23.573 position:50% align:center
Aw. That sounds super lame!

00:05:23.656 --> 00:05:25.408 position:50% align:center
[CHISAKI]
Once I trust you a little more,

00:05:25.492 --> 00:05:27.035 position:50% align:center
you can do what you want.

00:05:27.118 --> 00:05:29.621 position:50% align:center
But you'll have to
prove yourselves.

00:05:31.122 --> 00:05:32.540 position:50% align:center
[MIMIC]
You'd better fix those attitudes

00:05:32.624 --> 00:05:34.793 position:50% align:center
if you wanna be taken seriously.

00:05:34.876 --> 00:05:37.921 position:50% align:center
For us to accept you,
you gotta follow orders, brats.

00:05:38.004 --> 00:05:40.131 position:50% align:center
We're yakuza. Not some
back-alley thugs.

00:05:40.215 --> 00:05:42.008 position:50% align:center
You two got it?

00:05:42.092 --> 00:05:44.219 position:50% align:center
Pretty soon we'll be
controlling society

00:05:44.302 --> 00:05:45.637 position:50% align:center
again from the shadows.

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:48.473 position:50% align:center
The complete resurrection
of the Shie Hassaikai!

00:05:48.556 --> 00:05:50.517 position:50% align:center
I bet the boss'll even
get out of his sickbed

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:51.810 position:50% align:center
when he hears the news.

00:05:51.893 --> 00:05:53.645 position:50% align:center
And you can be a part of it.

00:05:53.728 --> 00:05:58.733 position:50% align:center
As long as you're properly
grateful and do as you're told.

00:05:58.817 --> 00:06:01.486 position:50% align:center
I will not forgive
anyone who disgraces

00:06:01.569 --> 00:06:04.072 position:50% align:center
the way of the yakuza!

00:06:05.031 --> 00:06:08.993 position:50% align:center
[MIMIC]
Crush them all to death!

00:06:09.077 --> 00:06:11.162 position:50% align:center
[MIMIC roars]

00:06:11.246 --> 00:06:14.082 position:50% align:center
[TOGA] Wimps like you always
have shortest tempers.

00:06:14.165 --> 00:06:17.377 position:50% align:center
You get all mad and show
what losers you are.

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:19.879 position:50% align:center
[TOGA] We don't have the
power to face them all now.

00:06:19.963 --> 00:06:21.715 position:50% align:center
[TWICE] We'll just leave
it up to the heroes

00:06:21.798 --> 00:06:23.049 position:50% align:center
to deal with them.

00:06:23.133 --> 00:06:24.801 position:50% align:center
[MIMIC yelling]

00:06:24.884 --> 00:06:26.886 position:50% align:center
[AIZAWA]
That yell! You heard it, right?

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:29.055 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] The voice must
belong to Irinaka.

00:06:29.139 --> 00:06:32.100 position:50% align:center
As soon as I heard it,
everything started to move.

00:06:32.183 --> 00:06:33.101 position:50% align:center
Where is he?

00:06:33.184 --> 00:06:35.228 position:50% align:center
[MIMIC yelling]

00:06:35.311 --> 00:06:37.355 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] There's too much of
an echo to pinpoint him.

00:06:37.439 --> 00:06:39.399 position:50% align:center
[DETECTIVE 70A] If we don't stop
this, we're going to be crushed!

00:06:39.482 --> 00:06:40.859 position:50% align:center
[POLICE 74A yelps]

00:06:40.942 --> 00:06:42.986 position:50% align:center
I get it, you wanna
hide how weak you are

00:06:43.069 --> 00:06:45.155 position:50% align:center
from the rest of the world.

00:06:45.238 --> 00:06:46.990 position:50% align:center
You look down on
other people because

00:06:47.073 --> 00:06:49.409 position:50% align:center
you think it makes
you look stronger.

00:06:51.161 --> 00:06:55.874 position:50% align:center
So lame. That's
the yakuza for ya.

00:06:55.957 --> 00:07:01.171 position:50% align:center
[MIMIC growls, yells]

00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:06.760 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
One For All, Full Cowling!

00:07:08.511 --> 00:07:11.139 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Smash!

00:07:15.769 --> 00:07:18.438 position:50% align:center
[MIMIC]
What? My Quirk!

00:07:18.521 --> 00:07:20.440 position:50% align:center
[TWICE]
Sorry, yakuza!

00:07:20.523 --> 00:07:23.485 position:50% align:center
I think we'll do what
we want after all.

00:07:23.568 --> 00:07:24.694 position:50% align:center
[TOGA, TWICE]
Later!

00:07:24.778 --> 00:07:26.071 position:50% align:center
The League of Villains!

00:07:26.154 --> 00:07:27.530 position:50% align:center
You'll pay--

00:07:30.992 --> 00:07:31.993 position:50% align:center
Catch him!

00:07:36.206 --> 00:07:38.083 position:50% align:center
[AIZAWA]
The League betrayed them?

00:07:38.166 --> 00:07:39.834 position:50% align:center
Seems so.

00:07:39.918 --> 00:07:42.796 position:50% align:center
And they used us to aid
in their scheming.

00:07:42.879 --> 00:07:46.591 position:50% align:center
Though at least we're
on solid ground now.

00:07:46.675 --> 00:07:49.302 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Eri. Togata.

00:07:52.305 --> 00:07:53.765 position:50% align:center
Excuse me, gentlemen.

00:07:53.848 --> 00:07:56.518 position:50% align:center
But, we need to talk.

00:07:56.601 --> 00:07:58.687 position:50% align:center
You've got some
explaining to do.

00:07:58.770 --> 00:08:00.980 position:50% align:center
Why don't we have
a chat about Eri.

00:08:01.064 --> 00:08:04.859 position:50% align:center
[CHISAKI] You shouldn't have
been able to get here so fast.

00:08:04.943 --> 00:08:08.238 position:50% align:center
I took a shortcut.
Give me the girl.

00:08:08.321 --> 00:08:09.989 position:50% align:center
I'm here to rescue her.

00:08:10.073 --> 00:08:11.866 position:50% align:center
[CHISAKI]
Now that you know the situation,

00:08:11.950 --> 00:08:15.829 position:50% align:center
you've decided to play
hero, eh, schoolboy?

00:08:15.912 --> 00:08:17.330 position:50% align:center
[MIRIO] Right! Well,
we're still pretty new,

00:08:17.414 --> 00:08:20.041 position:50% align:center
but you probably already
guessed that much.

00:08:20.125 --> 00:08:23.920 position:50% align:center
[CHISAKI] You were happy being
ignorant when we first met.

00:08:24.004 --> 00:08:25.714 position:50% align:center
Unfortunately for you,

00:08:25.797 --> 00:08:28.341 position:50% align:center
this girl didn't wanna
come with you.

00:08:28.425 --> 00:08:30.844 position:50% align:center
You're no hero to her.

00:08:33.138 --> 00:08:35.682 position:50% align:center
That's why I'm here.

00:08:35.765 --> 00:08:37.726 position:50% align:center
[CHISAKI]
I'm not gettin' through to you.

00:08:37.809 --> 00:08:40.979 position:50% align:center
Allow me to be clearer.

00:08:41.062 --> 00:08:43.773 position:50% align:center
You're going to die down here.

00:08:45.608 --> 00:08:48.987 position:50% align:center
[MIRIO grunts]
What's happening to my body?

00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:50.822 position:50% align:center
[MIRIO]
My balance is all off.

00:08:50.905 --> 00:08:55.368 position:50% align:center
[SAKAKI cackles]
You feelin' sloshed?

00:08:56.536 --> 00:08:59.664 position:50% align:center
[SAKAKI] Your legs look
shaky an' you're swaying.

00:08:59.748 --> 00:09:05.003 position:50% align:center
I feel the same. That's why
I'm walkin' up 'ere.

00:09:05.086 --> 00:09:07.630 position:50% align:center
Stand too close to me...

00:09:07.714 --> 00:09:10.050 position:50% align:center
[MIRIO]
Okay. It's this guy's Quirk.

00:09:10.133 --> 00:09:11.593 position:50% align:center
Eri's still right
in front of me.

00:09:11.676 --> 00:09:13.678 position:50% align:center
I've just gotta get
past him and--

00:09:17.015 --> 00:09:19.059 position:50% align:center
[NEMOTO]
What is your Quirk?

00:09:19.142 --> 00:09:20.852 position:50% align:center
Permeation. When activated,

00:09:20.935 --> 00:09:23.438 position:50% align:center
I can pass through anything!

00:09:23.521 --> 00:09:25.648 position:50% align:center
[MIRIO]
Why'd I tell him that?

00:09:25.732 --> 00:09:28.109 position:50% align:center
[NEMOTO] I see. That
explains how you made it

00:09:28.193 --> 00:09:30.862 position:50% align:center
this far so quickly. You used
your power to slip past

00:09:30.945 --> 00:09:32.322 position:50% align:center
Mimic and the others.

00:09:32.405 --> 00:09:34.366 position:50% align:center
[SAKAKI]
You missed him? Stupid.

00:09:34.449 --> 00:09:35.825 position:50% align:center
What're you, drunk?

00:09:35.909 --> 00:09:37.327 position:50% align:center
[NEMOTO]
That would be you.

00:09:37.410 --> 00:09:38.536 position:50% align:center
[SAKAKI]
Ya think?

00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:40.497 position:50% align:center
[NEMOTO] I suggest you
stay silent and support

00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:42.749 position:50% align:center
your superior teammate.

00:09:42.832 --> 00:09:43.750 position:50% align:center
[PRESENT MIC]
From the Eight Bullets

00:09:43.833 --> 00:09:45.502 position:50% align:center
of the Hassai Group,
Shin Nemoto!

00:09:45.585 --> 00:09:46.795 position:50% align:center
Quirk: Confession!

00:09:46.878 --> 00:09:48.421 position:50% align:center
He can force people
to tell the truth

00:09:48.505 --> 00:09:49.756 position:50% align:center
if he asks them a question.

00:09:49.839 --> 00:09:52.300 position:50% align:center
Occasionally, he can
even drag out a truth

00:09:52.384 --> 00:09:54.803 position:50% align:center
the person talking
doesn't know about!

00:09:54.886 --> 00:09:58.765 position:50% align:center
Also from the Eight Bullets,
Deidoro Sakaki! Quirk: Sloshed!

00:09:58.848 --> 00:10:01.810 position:50% align:center
He causes those around him
to lose their equilibrium.

00:10:01.893 --> 00:10:03.269 position:50% align:center
I get it.

00:10:03.353 --> 00:10:06.648 position:50% align:center
Your power must've forced me
to tell the truth somehow,

00:10:06.731 --> 00:10:10.694 position:50% align:center
and they put someone like you
on the front lines? Weird.

00:10:10.777 --> 00:10:12.153 position:50% align:center
[NEMOTO]
That's true.

00:10:12.237 --> 00:10:14.906 position:50% align:center
I am in a different class
compared to the dispensable

00:10:14.989 --> 00:10:16.700 position:50% align:center
pawns in this organization.

00:10:16.783 --> 00:10:18.576 position:50% align:center
I'm the only one who
fully understands

00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:20.537 position:50% align:center
the young boss's ambition.

00:10:22.038 --> 00:10:25.500 position:50% align:center
He's torturing his own daughter,
and you call that ambition?

00:10:26.626 --> 00:10:31.089 position:50% align:center
[NEMOTO] Hm? Aw. It would be
wise for you to leave

00:10:31.172 --> 00:10:33.341 position:50% align:center
your feelings out of this.

00:10:33.425 --> 00:10:37.137 position:50% align:center
Don't you know they'll
only get you in trouble?

00:10:37.220 --> 00:10:39.681 position:50% align:center
When you first met
Eri in the street.

00:10:39.764 --> 00:10:42.600 position:50% align:center
You let her return
with the boss. Correct?

00:10:42.684 --> 00:10:44.894 position:50% align:center
Yeah. I did.

00:10:44.978 --> 00:10:47.147 position:50% align:center
[NEMOTO] And then you found
out what our plan was

00:10:47.230 --> 00:10:49.149 position:50% align:center
and regretted abandoning her.

00:10:49.232 --> 00:10:52.360 position:50% align:center
That's why you've come
to rescue the child.

00:10:52.444 --> 00:10:53.987 position:50% align:center
You're no hero.

00:10:54.070 --> 00:10:57.824 position:50% align:center
You're just trying to soothe
your own conscience, aren't you?

00:10:57.907 --> 00:11:00.952 position:50% align:center
[NEMOTO] His body is already
swaying thanks to Sakaki.

00:11:01.036 --> 00:11:02.954 position:50% align:center
Now to hit him where it hurts.

00:11:03.038 --> 00:11:04.998 position:50% align:center
Make him question
what he's fighting for.

00:11:05.081 --> 00:11:08.460 position:50% align:center
If I can make him lose
focus, it's all over.

00:11:08.543 --> 00:11:10.795 position:50% align:center
[NEMOTO] I live for the
young boss's ambition!

00:11:10.879 --> 00:11:12.881 position:50% align:center
He needs me! I'm his right hand!

00:11:12.964 --> 00:11:14.507 position:50% align:center
His most valued assistant!

00:11:14.591 --> 00:11:18.094 position:50% align:center
We'll share such joy when
his plans come to fruition!

00:11:18.178 --> 00:11:18.928 position:50% align:center
Now!

00:11:19.012 --> 00:11:19.763 position:50% align:center
[SAKAKI]
Now!

00:11:19.846 --> 00:11:21.473 position:50% align:center
[NEMOTO]
Die, you nuisance!

00:11:26.269 --> 00:11:27.729 position:50% align:center
[MIRIO]
Ultimate move.

00:11:29.522 --> 00:11:31.566 position:50% align:center
[MIRIO]
Phantom Threat!

00:11:33.610 --> 00:11:36.821 position:50% align:center
[MIRIO]
He's right. I am weak.

00:11:36.905 --> 00:11:41.284 position:50% align:center
I've been carrying around
the guilt of letting Eri go.

00:11:41.368 --> 00:11:44.996 position:50% align:center
I acted unforgivably in
front of that little girl.

00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:48.291 position:50% align:center
But despite that, rather
than see us get hurt.

00:11:48.375 --> 00:11:51.169 position:50% align:center
She chose to return
to that hell!

00:11:51.252 --> 00:11:54.964 position:50% align:center
She's kinder than any one of us!

00:11:55.048 --> 00:11:56.883 position:50% align:center
That's why I chased after her.

00:11:56.966 --> 00:11:59.928 position:50% align:center
And why I won't stop
until she's safe.

00:12:00.011 --> 00:12:02.305 position:50% align:center
No way! How's he still upright?

00:12:02.389 --> 00:12:03.932 position:50% align:center
[MIRIO] I get a taste of
something much worse

00:12:04.015 --> 00:12:06.476 position:50% align:center
than your intoxicating
Quirk on the regular.

00:12:06.559 --> 00:12:09.729 position:50% align:center
[NEMOTO] You're no hero.
You know the truth!

00:12:09.813 --> 00:12:11.231 position:50% align:center
I won't waver!

00:12:11.314 --> 00:12:13.858 position:50% align:center
I'm going to make sure
she has a reason to smile.

00:12:13.942 --> 00:12:17.862 position:50% align:center
Until she can, I won't stop!

00:12:17.946 --> 00:12:20.198 position:50% align:center
[yells]

00:12:20.281 --> 00:12:22.867 position:50% align:center
Power!

00:12:32.293 --> 00:12:34.421 position:50% align:center
[MIRIO]
Chisaki!

00:12:44.014 --> 00:12:46.516 position:50% align:center
Please don't. Go back.

00:12:46.599 --> 00:12:50.061 position:50% align:center
Leave me! Otherwise
he'll kill you!

00:12:52.313 --> 00:12:56.067 position:50% align:center
I'm never going to let
you down again, Eri.

00:12:56.151 --> 00:13:00.655 position:50% align:center
I swear it. I am going
to be your hero!

00:13:10.832 --> 00:13:13.877 position:50% align:center
I am going to be your hero!

00:13:18.423 --> 00:13:20.300 position:50% align:center
[CHISAKI]
Filthy.

00:13:21.676 --> 00:13:23.595 position:50% align:center
[CHISAKI]
Come back, Eri.

00:13:23.678 --> 00:13:26.306 position:50% align:center
How many times do I
have to tell you?

00:13:26.389 --> 00:13:28.058 position:50% align:center
It's your fault.

00:13:28.141 --> 00:13:29.559 position:50% align:center
You break people.

00:13:29.642 --> 00:13:31.686 position:50% align:center
That's just how you were born.

00:13:31.770 --> 00:13:33.104 position:50% align:center
Go. Hurry!

00:13:33.188 --> 00:13:35.190 position:50% align:center
Don't listen to him.

00:13:35.273 --> 00:13:37.734 position:50% align:center
[CHISAKI]
You know how this goes.

00:13:37.817 --> 00:13:39.944 position:50% align:center
I always have to get
my hands dirty

00:13:40.028 --> 00:13:42.322 position:50% align:center
because of your selfishness.

00:13:42.405 --> 00:13:46.159 position:50% align:center
Every action you take
results in people dying.

00:13:46.242 --> 00:13:48.495 position:50% align:center
You're a cursed human.

00:13:49.788 --> 00:13:53.208 position:50% align:center
How could you ever say
that to your own daughter?

00:13:53.291 --> 00:13:55.210 position:50% align:center
[CHISAKI]
Huh? Oh, right.

00:13:55.293 --> 00:13:58.254 position:50% align:center
That's the story I told you.

00:13:58.338 --> 00:14:00.173 position:50% align:center
I don't have any children.

00:14:00.256 --> 00:14:01.549 position:50% align:center
[MIRIO gasps]

00:14:03.385 --> 00:14:04.844 position:50% align:center
[SIR NIGHTEYE]
Quirk: Overhaul.

00:14:04.928 --> 00:14:07.305 position:50% align:center
With this power of his,
he can disassemble

00:14:07.389 --> 00:14:09.516 position:50% align:center
and reassemble anything.

00:14:12.936 --> 00:14:14.437 position:50% align:center
[MIRIO]
He's not just reassembling.

00:14:14.521 --> 00:14:18.733 position:50% align:center
He's shaping new spikes!
And he's so fast!

00:14:18.817 --> 00:14:22.654 position:50% align:center
[MIRIO] You could've been
hurt. But he didn't care.

00:14:22.737 --> 00:14:24.280 position:50% align:center
[CHISAKI] Yeah, it wouldn't
have been a big deal

00:14:24.364 --> 00:14:26.449 position:50% align:center
if she got hurt.

00:14:26.533 --> 00:14:28.535 position:50% align:center
If I put her back
together immediately,

00:14:28.618 --> 00:14:30.078 position:50% align:center
I can revive her.

00:14:30.161 --> 00:14:33.415 position:50% align:center
Even if she's not quite
the way she was before.

00:14:33.498 --> 00:14:36.501 position:50% align:center
Eri already knows what I can do.

00:14:36.584 --> 00:14:38.503 position:50% align:center
[MIRIO growls]

00:14:43.008 --> 00:14:45.552 position:50% align:center
[CHISAKI] What'll you do
if Eri gets injured?

00:14:45.635 --> 00:14:46.803 position:50% align:center
Under these conditions,

00:14:46.886 --> 00:14:49.889 position:50% align:center
I'm the only one
who can heal her.

00:14:49.973 --> 00:14:52.058 position:50% align:center
I've sealed off your escape.

00:14:52.142 --> 00:14:53.935 position:50% align:center
And you won't be able
to run away using

00:14:54.019 --> 00:14:56.312 position:50% align:center
Permeation while
you're holding her.

00:14:56.396 --> 00:15:00.275 position:50% align:center
So. You going to
fight me, Schoolboy?

00:15:01.443 --> 00:15:03.403 position:50% align:center
[MIRIO] I thought I
knocked that drunk out,

00:15:03.486 --> 00:15:07.615 position:50% align:center
but my balance is still off.
Is his Quirk still in effect?

00:15:08.742 --> 00:15:12.412 position:50% align:center
[CHISAKI] Careful. Aim for
the arm wrapped around Eri.

00:15:12.495 --> 00:15:13.788 position:50% align:center
[KURONO]
I didn't expect he'd be able

00:15:13.872 --> 00:15:16.041 position:50% align:center
to use his Quirk so precisely.

00:15:16.124 --> 00:15:19.252 position:50% align:center
It's obvious he's
been well trained.

00:15:19.336 --> 00:15:22.964 position:50% align:center
[CHISAKI] Can't let anything
get in the way of your shot.

00:15:23.048 --> 00:15:25.759 position:50% align:center
[MIRIO] He's clearing the path
so the bullet can hit me.

00:15:25.842 --> 00:15:27.469 position:50% align:center
Sorry 'bout this.

00:15:27.552 --> 00:15:28.970 position:50% align:center
[MIRIO] I can't see
his face, but based on

00:15:29.054 --> 00:15:31.056 position:50% align:center
what he's doing,
I'd say that's Kurono,

00:15:31.139 --> 00:15:33.058 position:50% align:center
Chisaki's right hand man.

00:15:33.141 --> 00:15:35.268 position:50% align:center
If the briefing was right,
I definitely don't wanna be

00:15:35.352 --> 00:15:37.103 position:50% align:center
on the receiving
end of his Quirk.

00:15:38.688 --> 00:15:42.025 position:50% align:center
[KURONO] He hid his body
to obscure my aim.

00:15:42.108 --> 00:15:43.568 position:50% align:center
And here I thought
heroes wore capes

00:15:43.651 --> 00:15:45.528 position:50% align:center
just to make them look cool.

00:15:45.612 --> 00:15:47.405 position:50% align:center
[CHISAKI gasps]
Chrono!

00:15:50.825 --> 00:15:52.702 position:50% align:center
[KURONO]
Sorry, Overhaul!

00:15:52.786 --> 00:15:56.498 position:50% align:center
[CHISAKI] He's strong.
But... he put Eri down!

00:15:56.581 --> 00:16:00.377 position:50% align:center
If I break her, he'll
be forced to back off.

00:16:00.460 --> 00:16:03.505 position:50% align:center
[MIRIO] Of course you
would do that! Monster!

00:16:05.423 --> 00:16:07.676 position:50% align:center
You wanna know why
a hero wears a cape?

00:16:07.759 --> 00:16:10.345 position:50% align:center
So he can use it to comfort
someone who's suffering.

00:16:10.428 --> 00:16:11.763 position:50% align:center
That's why!

00:16:13.056 --> 00:16:14.474 position:50% align:center
[MIRIO]
Watch my opponent.

00:16:15.392 --> 00:16:17.936 position:50% align:center
[MIRIO]
Predict his next move! Act fast!

00:16:18.978 --> 00:16:21.022 position:50% align:center
[MIRIO] Chisaki's so good,
it's hard to believe

00:16:21.106 --> 00:16:23.566 position:50% align:center
he's just some yakuza thug.

00:16:23.650 --> 00:16:27.153 position:50% align:center
He's strong, yeah. But...

00:16:28.446 --> 00:16:33.201 position:50% align:center
Make no mistake. I'm stronger!

00:16:33.284 --> 00:16:36.329 position:50% align:center
[MIRIO] I'm never going to
let you down again, Eri.

00:16:36.413 --> 00:16:39.332 position:50% align:center
I am going to be your hero!

00:16:39.416 --> 00:16:41.668 position:50% align:center
You won't lay another
finger on her.

00:16:41.751 --> 00:16:44.004 position:50% align:center
I'll take on anyone I have to!

00:16:44.087 --> 00:16:47.090 position:50% align:center
You've lost this fight, Chisaki!

00:16:47.173 --> 00:16:50.468 position:50% align:center
[CHISAKI] Don't use that
name so casually, fool.

00:16:50.552 --> 00:16:52.637 position:50% align:center
I've abandoned it.

00:16:54.472 --> 00:16:56.891 position:50% align:center
[BOSS 74A] Well, if you
have nowhere else to go,

00:16:56.975 --> 00:16:59.144 position:50% align:center
you can come with me, kid.

00:16:59.227 --> 00:17:02.814 position:50% align:center
What's your name? Can you speak?

00:17:02.897 --> 00:17:06.818 position:50% align:center
[CHISAKI]
Chisaki. Kai Chisaki.

00:17:06.901 --> 00:17:09.738 position:50% align:center
[BOSS 74A] The Todo gang
was forced to disband.

00:17:09.821 --> 00:17:12.991 position:50% align:center
And our numbers
continue to dwindle.

00:17:13.074 --> 00:17:15.910 position:50% align:center
[CHISAKI] At this rate, it's
only a matter of time for us.

00:17:15.994 --> 00:17:18.246 position:50% align:center
We need to be more innovative.

00:17:18.329 --> 00:17:20.623 position:50% align:center
What about the plan
I told you about before?

00:17:20.707 --> 00:17:21.791 position:50% align:center
Have you given it more thought?

00:17:21.875 --> 00:17:23.209 position:50% align:center
[BOSS 74A]
Are you still bringing that up?

00:17:23.293 --> 00:17:25.962 position:50% align:center
I gave you your answer, Chisaki.

00:17:26.046 --> 00:17:28.006 position:50% align:center
Stray too far from
your humanity,

00:17:28.089 --> 00:17:30.967 position:50% align:center
and you're losing sight
of the old ways.

00:17:31.051 --> 00:17:34.554 position:50% align:center
No one's going to follow
a demon with no heart.

00:17:34.637 --> 00:17:36.723 position:50% align:center
[NEMOTO]
Master!

00:17:36.806 --> 00:17:38.683 position:50% align:center
[MIRIO] I thought he was
down for the count.

00:17:38.767 --> 00:17:40.643 position:50% align:center
[CHISAKI]
Nemoto! Shoot!

00:17:41.853 --> 00:17:43.730 position:50% align:center
[CHISAKI]
Join the organization.

00:17:45.607 --> 00:17:48.318 position:50% align:center
[CHISAKI] It'll be reassuring
to have you with me.

00:17:48.401 --> 00:17:50.403 position:50% align:center
[NEMOTO]
Those were his true feelings.

00:17:50.487 --> 00:17:53.365 position:50% align:center
The boss needs me.
I can't let him down.

00:17:53.448 --> 00:17:58.870 position:50% align:center
Even if it costs me my life,
I'll assist him however I can.

00:17:58.953 --> 00:18:02.040 position:50% align:center
But where do I aim?
I only have one bullet,

00:18:02.123 --> 00:18:04.417 position:50% align:center
and I'm shooting at
an untouchable target.

00:18:04.501 --> 00:18:06.961 position:50% align:center
How can I keep him
from using his Quirk?

00:18:07.045 --> 00:18:09.422 position:50% align:center
[MIRIO] I'm going to make sure
she has a reason to smile.

00:18:09.506 --> 00:18:11.841 position:50% align:center
Until she can. I won't stop!

00:18:11.925 --> 00:18:14.260 position:50% align:center
[NEMOTO gasps]
His true feelings!

00:18:23.645 --> 00:18:27.065 position:50% align:center
[MIRIO] You've been living with
so much despair this whole time.

00:18:27.148 --> 00:18:30.527 position:50% align:center
Thinking you had no choice
but to suffer so much.

00:18:30.610 --> 00:18:32.278 position:50% align:center
That help would never come.

00:18:32.362 --> 00:18:35.907 position:50% align:center
[CHISAKI]
Eri already knows what I can do.

00:18:35.990 --> 00:18:38.368 position:50% align:center
[MIRIO] Well, I'm not going
to let you down again.

00:18:39.994 --> 00:18:41.037 position:50% align:center
[MIRIO]
Don't worry.

00:18:41.121 --> 00:18:44.833 position:50% align:center
I won't let you
suffer. Not anymore!

00:19:03.059 --> 00:19:05.562 position:50% align:center
I'll be a hero who saves people.

00:19:05.645 --> 00:19:07.439 position:50% align:center
[MIRIO'S DAD]
Mirio.

00:19:07.522 --> 00:19:08.982 position:50% align:center
You have to be careful.

00:19:09.065 --> 00:19:11.735 position:50% align:center
One wrong move with your Quirk,
and you could split in two.

00:19:11.818 --> 00:19:13.111 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:19:13.194 --> 00:19:15.363 position:50% align:center
[MIRIO'S DAD] It's a really
hard power to master.

00:19:15.447 --> 00:19:18.700 position:50% align:center
That's why your pops here
gave up on being a pro.

00:19:18.783 --> 00:19:20.869 position:50% align:center
You sure you still
wanna be a hero?

00:19:20.952 --> 00:19:23.288 position:50% align:center
You bet!

00:19:23.371 --> 00:19:25.373 position:50% align:center
All right.

00:19:25.457 --> 00:19:29.669 position:50% align:center
Then I'll support you
in any way I can.

00:19:29.753 --> 00:19:31.379 position:50% align:center
No matter what, Mirio.

00:19:33.423 --> 00:19:35.592 position:50% align:center
[MIRIO'S DAD]
Just do your best!

00:19:43.141 --> 00:19:45.310 position:50% align:center
[CHISAKI]
You're diseased.

00:19:45.393 --> 00:19:49.105 position:50% align:center
Your Quirks allow you to dream
you'll become something bigger.

00:19:49.189 --> 00:19:52.609 position:50% align:center
But that way of thinking
is an illness of the mind.

00:19:52.692 --> 00:19:54.110 position:50% align:center
I'm offering the world a cure.

00:19:54.194 --> 00:19:55.987 position:50% align:center
[NEMOTO]
Master. I did it.

00:19:56.071 --> 00:19:59.616 position:50% align:center
[CHISAKI] Ironic, isn't it?
You came here to save this girl,

00:19:59.699 --> 00:20:02.035 position:50% align:center
and it's her power
that will end everything

00:20:02.118 --> 00:20:03.745 position:50% align:center
you've come to rely on.

00:20:03.828 --> 00:20:05.622 position:50% align:center
You're powerless.

00:20:08.750 --> 00:20:10.752 position:50% align:center
[MIRIO]
Watch your opponent carefully.

00:20:10.835 --> 00:20:14.631 position:50% align:center
Predict his next move!

00:20:14.714 --> 00:20:18.051 position:50% align:center
No. I am not powerless!

00:20:18.134 --> 00:20:21.012 position:50% align:center
I am still Lemillion!

00:20:22.472 --> 00:20:23.973 position:50% align:center
[NEMOTO]
I can't believe it.

00:20:24.057 --> 00:20:26.643 position:50% align:center
Sakaki's Quirk is
still in effect.

00:20:26.726 --> 00:20:28.478 position:50% align:center
And he's lost the
power that made him

00:20:28.561 --> 00:20:32.232 position:50% align:center
seem invincible.
Yet, he still fights.

00:20:32.315 --> 00:20:34.693 position:50% align:center
Why? For the girl?

00:20:34.776 --> 00:20:38.571 position:50% align:center
Madness. What is he?

00:20:51.835 --> 00:20:53.670 position:50% align:center
[MIRIO]
I'll do my best!

00:21:02.345 --> 00:21:03.805 position:50% align:center
[MIRIO grunts]

00:21:14.232 --> 00:21:18.319 position:50% align:center
[MIRIO] I'll become a hero
and save people!

00:22:55.458 --> 00:22:59.379 position:50% align:center
[CHISAKI] You wanted to
become a hero so badly.

00:22:59.462 --> 00:23:02.215 position:50% align:center
And you couldn't even save Eri.

00:23:02.298 --> 00:23:05.927 position:50% align:center
You're filthy,
Lemillion. Infected.

00:23:06.011 --> 00:23:08.638 position:50% align:center
But I'll fix you
all with her power.

00:23:08.722 --> 00:23:11.683 position:50% align:center
Every last one of you.

00:23:11.766 --> 00:23:17.439 position:50% align:center
[MIRIO] Nighteye. Tamaki.
I'm still fighting.

00:23:17.522 --> 00:23:18.815 position:50% align:center
Chisaki!

00:23:18.898 --> 00:23:21.776 position:50% align:center
[CHISAKI] I told you that's
not my name anymore!

00:23:29.951 --> 00:23:31.411 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Here's the preview!

00:23:31.494 --> 00:23:34.039 position:50% align:center
Togata protected Eri
until the end.

00:23:34.122 --> 00:23:36.082 position:50% align:center
No matter how much
they hurt him.

00:23:36.166 --> 00:23:38.418 position:50% align:center
No matter that they took away.

00:23:38.501 --> 00:23:40.086 position:50% align:center
Now, it's my turn.

00:23:40.170 --> 00:23:43.298 position:50% align:center
But Chisaki is furious that
Eri might be taken from him.

00:23:43.381 --> 00:23:44.716 position:50% align:center
He unleashes his Quirk,

00:23:44.799 --> 00:23:47.302 position:50% align:center
a power unlike any
I've ever faced.

00:23:47.385 --> 00:23:49.846 position:50% align:center
Next time, "Unforeseen Hope."

00:23:49.929 --> 00:23:52.724 position:50% align:center
Nighteye's power allows him
to see into the future.

00:23:52.807 --> 00:23:55.268 position:50% align:center
But what does that hold
for me and Eri?

00:23:55.352 --> 00:23:57.771 position:50% align:center
Go beyond! Plus Ultra!
