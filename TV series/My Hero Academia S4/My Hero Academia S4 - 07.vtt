00:00:10.301 --> 00:00:13.471 position:50% align:center
[FATGUM] At Red Riot's debut
fight, I saw something new.

00:00:13.555 --> 00:00:15.807 position:50% align:center
Tamaki was shot,
and the bullet contained

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:18.435 position:50% align:center
some kinda drug I've
never heard of before.

00:00:18.518 --> 00:00:20.562 position:50% align:center
One that destroys Quirks.

00:00:20.645 --> 00:00:22.188 position:50% align:center
And when we analyzed
the substance

00:00:22.272 --> 00:00:24.149 position:50% align:center
from the bullet, we
discovered it contained

00:00:24.232 --> 00:00:25.984 position:50% align:center
human blood and cells.

00:00:26.067 --> 00:00:28.903 position:50% align:center
In other words, that
effect came from a person,

00:00:28.987 --> 00:00:33.533 position:50% align:center
from someone's power.
A Quirk that can destroy Quirks.

00:00:33.616 --> 00:00:37.203 position:50% align:center
[SIR NIGHTEYE] Their young head,
Chisaki: Quirk, Overhaul.

00:00:37.287 --> 00:00:40.832 position:50% align:center
A Quirk that allows him to
completely break down matter.

00:00:40.915 --> 00:00:45.128 position:50% align:center
And a bullet that can
break down Quirks.

00:00:45.211 --> 00:00:47.630 position:50% align:center
Chisaki has a
daughter named Eri.

00:00:47.714 --> 00:00:50.842 position:50% align:center
There are no records or
details about her birth,

00:00:50.925 --> 00:00:53.428 position:50% align:center
but when Miro and Midoriya
encountered her,

00:00:53.511 --> 00:00:54.804 position:50% align:center
they noticed there were bandages

00:00:54.888 --> 00:00:57.807 position:50% align:center
wrapped around her
arms and legs.

00:00:57.891 --> 00:00:59.768 position:50% align:center
[LOCKLOCK] We're wondering
if this Chisaki bastard

00:00:59.851 --> 00:01:02.062 position:50% align:center
is turning his daughter's
body into bullets

00:01:02.145 --> 00:01:04.856 position:50% align:center
and selling them
on the black market.

00:01:06.274 --> 00:01:08.151 position:50% align:center
Woulda saved us a lot
of trouble if those two

00:01:08.234 --> 00:01:11.196 position:50% align:center
amateurs had just gotten
the girl away from him.

00:01:11.279 --> 00:01:12.906 position:50% align:center
[SIR NIGHTEYE] I assure you,
nobody in this room

00:01:12.989 --> 00:01:15.367 position:50% align:center
is more frustrated
than they are.

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.619 position:50% align:center
We'll get Eri away
from him next time,

00:01:17.702 --> 00:01:19.162 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
...and we'll protect her!

00:01:19.245 --> 00:01:20.538 position:50% align:center
Indeed.

00:01:20.622 --> 00:01:23.500 position:50% align:center
That's precisely what
we've come here to discuss.

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:01.556 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] A few days had passed
since we'd learned the truth.

00:03:06.061 --> 00:03:07.479 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] The pro heroes
that had teamed up

00:03:07.562 --> 00:03:09.647 position:50% align:center
with Sir Nighteye were doing
their best to pinpoint

00:03:09.731 --> 00:03:12.776 position:50% align:center
the location of Chisaki,
Shie Hassaikai's young head,

00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:15.236 position:50% align:center
and his daughter, Eri.

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:17.655 position:50% align:center
Until they could,
we were on standby.

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:21.076 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] And we were under
orders not to say anything

00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:24.204 position:50% align:center
about our work
studies to anyone.

00:03:28.416 --> 00:03:29.668 position:50% align:center
You can really tell
who's started

00:03:29.751 --> 00:03:31.169 position:50% align:center
their works studies, huh?

00:03:31.252 --> 00:03:33.838 position:50% align:center
They picked up some tricks
while they were away from here.

00:03:33.922 --> 00:03:35.840 position:50% align:center
Hey! What've you
guys been learning?

00:03:35.924 --> 00:03:36.758 position:50% align:center
Tell me!

00:03:36.841 --> 00:03:39.427 position:50% align:center
[KIRISHIMA]
Sorry, we can't!

00:03:39.511 --> 00:03:44.099 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Kirishima, Uraraka, Asui.

00:03:44.182 --> 00:03:45.767 position:50% align:center
Everyone who was there
for the conference

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:48.728 position:50% align:center
would be part of the
operation to save Eri.

00:03:51.439 --> 00:03:54.442 position:50% align:center
[AIZAWA] Don't get too
worked up about this.

00:03:54.526 --> 00:03:56.111 position:50% align:center
The Big Three are one thing.

00:03:56.194 --> 00:03:57.487 position:50% align:center
They're strong enough
to hold their own

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:59.239 position:50% align:center
out there with the pros.

00:03:59.322 --> 00:04:02.742 position:50% align:center
But the rest of you will
be minimally involved.

00:04:02.826 --> 00:04:06.121 position:50% align:center
Asui, Uraraka, Kirishima.

00:04:06.204 --> 00:04:07.372 position:50% align:center
You didn't volunteer for this,

00:04:07.455 --> 00:04:09.624 position:50% align:center
and you're not obligated
to participate.

00:04:09.708 --> 00:04:10.667 position:50% align:center
It's your call.

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:12.669 position:50% align:center
[OCHACO]
Mr.--I mean, Eraser Head!

00:04:12.752 --> 00:04:14.421 position:50% align:center
After everything
that we just heard,

00:04:14.504 --> 00:04:16.381 position:50% align:center
I can't imagine not
helping out, sir.

00:04:16.464 --> 00:04:18.633 position:50% align:center
Yeah, if you're gonna
let us be part of this,

00:04:18.717 --> 00:04:20.802 position:50% align:center
I'd like to pitch in
however I can.

00:04:20.885 --> 00:04:23.179 position:50% align:center
The heroes asked you
to be in that meeting.

00:04:23.263 --> 00:04:24.681 position:50% align:center
I don't think they
would've wanted you guys

00:04:24.764 --> 00:04:27.267 position:50% align:center
to be there if they didn't
recognize your abilities.

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:29.728 position:50% align:center
I mean, I've seen for
myself that a first year

00:04:29.811 --> 00:04:31.271 position:50% align:center
can shine much brighter than me.

00:04:31.354 --> 00:04:34.941 position:50% align:center
You're gonna have to let that
go at some point, ya know.

00:04:35.025 --> 00:04:36.901 position:50% align:center
If I can use my power
to help that girl

00:04:36.985 --> 00:04:40.363 position:50% align:center
even a little bit, then
count me in, Eraser Head!

00:04:40.447 --> 00:04:42.490 position:50% align:center
As long as you all understand.

00:04:42.574 --> 00:04:43.992 position:50% align:center
Our scope here is limited.

00:04:44.075 --> 00:04:46.453 position:50% align:center
For now, our only goal
is to rescue Eri.

00:04:46.536 --> 00:04:49.581 position:50% align:center
We won't step in
further than that.

00:04:49.664 --> 00:04:52.000 position:50% align:center
Given the recent altercation,
neither the police

00:04:52.083 --> 00:04:54.294 position:50% align:center
nor Nighteye believe that
the League of Villains

00:04:54.377 --> 00:04:57.422 position:50% align:center
and the Shie Hassaikai
have formed a partnership.

00:04:57.505 --> 00:04:59.758 position:50% align:center
So the chances are relatively
low that the League

00:04:59.841 --> 00:05:02.927 position:50% align:center
will be involved in this raid.

00:05:03.011 --> 00:05:05.555 position:50% align:center
But if it turns out they're
mistaken about that,

00:05:05.638 --> 00:05:08.099 position:50% align:center
and the League does end up
putting in an appearance,

00:05:08.183 --> 00:05:10.226 position:50% align:center
you guys are out.

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:11.936 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
Understood, sir!

00:05:14.564 --> 00:05:17.901 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] Everyone was pumped up
and ready to rescue Eri.

00:05:17.984 --> 00:05:20.779 position:50% align:center
But something was
still weighing on me.

00:05:23.948 --> 00:05:25.200 position:50% align:center
[SIR NIGHTEYE]
Please! Stop!

00:05:25.283 --> 00:05:28.286 position:50% align:center
If you continue like this,
I swear, you'll face off

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:32.457 position:50% align:center
against a villain and die an
unspeakably gruesome death.

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:35.543 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] It didn't seem like
a good time to ask Nighteye.

00:05:35.627 --> 00:05:37.212 position:50% align:center
Since we were now
forbidden to talk about

00:05:37.295 --> 00:05:38.713 position:50% align:center
our work studies,
I couldn't bring it up

00:05:38.797 --> 00:05:40.632 position:50% align:center
with All Might, either.

00:05:40.715 --> 00:05:41.925 position:50% align:center
And it's not
something I can talk

00:05:42.008 --> 00:05:44.386 position:50% align:center
to the other students about.

00:05:44.469 --> 00:05:48.306 position:50% align:center
Eri's situation...
The threat to All Might...

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:50.934 position:50% align:center
It was almost too much for me.

00:05:51.017 --> 00:05:54.020 position:50% align:center
[ERI]
Please... Please don't go.

00:05:55.355 --> 00:05:57.065 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
I knew I needed to focus and put

00:05:57.148 --> 00:06:00.694 position:50% align:center
everything I had into
rescuing Eri, but...

00:06:00.777 --> 00:06:02.904 position:50% align:center
My mind felt so scattered.

00:06:02.987 --> 00:06:06.116 position:50% align:center
I was barely
holding it together.

00:06:06.199 --> 00:06:07.242 position:50% align:center
[TODOROKI]
You're not gonna eat?

00:06:07.325 --> 00:06:11.037 position:50% align:center
Uh-- Of course I am! Here, see?

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:13.540 position:50% align:center
Are you all right?

00:06:13.623 --> 00:06:15.208 position:50% align:center
You've been acting
edgy and depressed

00:06:15.291 --> 00:06:18.003 position:50% align:center
ever since you started
your work study.

00:06:19.129 --> 00:06:21.256 position:50% align:center
Oh, have I? Really?

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:28.513 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:06:28.596 --> 00:06:29.973 position:50% align:center
If you ever wanna
talk or anything,

00:06:30.056 --> 00:06:34.102 position:50% align:center
just let me know.
We're friends, right?

00:06:34.185 --> 00:06:35.729 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] Hey, if you ever
wanna talk or anything,

00:06:35.812 --> 00:06:37.105 position:50% align:center
just let us know.

00:06:37.188 --> 00:06:39.232 position:50% align:center
We're friends, right?

00:06:39.315 --> 00:06:41.067 position:50% align:center
That's what you said
to me, remember?

00:06:41.151 --> 00:06:43.445 position:50% align:center
Back when we were heading
off to our internships,

00:06:43.528 --> 00:06:45.113 position:50% align:center
and I was acting like a fool.

00:06:45.196 --> 00:06:50.493 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU sniffles]

00:06:50.577 --> 00:06:52.871 position:50% align:center
[TENYA yells]
Oh. Oh, dear!

00:06:52.954 --> 00:06:54.831 position:50% align:center
[TODOROKI]
Midoriya...

00:06:54.914 --> 00:06:58.501 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Sorry! It's okay. It's nothing.

00:06:59.586 --> 00:07:01.713 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] I can't tell you
what's going on.

00:07:01.796 --> 00:07:05.967 position:50% align:center
Not yet. But, thank you, Iida.

00:07:08.386 --> 00:07:11.890 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] Regret, sorrow,
fear, all the feelings

00:07:11.973 --> 00:07:15.602 position:50% align:center
I'd been trying to bury...
began to overflow a little.

00:07:17.729 --> 00:07:20.440 position:50% align:center
Heroes aren't supposed to cry!

00:07:20.523 --> 00:07:21.941 position:50% align:center
I dunno.

00:07:22.025 --> 00:07:27.197 position:50% align:center
I figure that heroes cry when
they need to, don't they?

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:29.449 position:50% align:center
Here, uh, you want
half of my soba?

00:07:29.532 --> 00:07:31.826 position:50% align:center
And I've got extra beef stew!

00:07:31.910 --> 00:07:33.411 position:50% align:center
Thanks, you guys.

00:07:33.495 --> 00:07:34.537 position:50% align:center
[TODOROKI]
Green onions?

00:07:34.621 --> 00:07:36.247 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Yeah, sure.

00:07:36.331 --> 00:07:37.791 position:50% align:center
[TODOROKI]
Wasabi?

00:07:37.874 --> 00:07:40.126 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Heh. Yeah.

00:07:54.974 --> 00:07:56.559 position:50% align:center
[SIR NIGHTEYE] We've made
a thorough list of groups

00:07:56.643 --> 00:07:59.521 position:50% align:center
with connections to Hassaikai,
as well as properties

00:07:59.604 --> 00:08:03.358 position:50% align:center
owned by the organization.
This is our starting point.

00:08:03.441 --> 00:08:04.651 position:50% align:center
I would like you
all to investigate

00:08:04.734 --> 00:08:06.528 position:50% align:center
each coordinate on this map.

00:08:06.611 --> 00:08:11.032 position:50% align:center
It is the most logical way
to narrow down our targets.

00:08:11.116 --> 00:08:13.743 position:50% align:center
[LOCKLOCK]
All right. This looks promising.

00:08:15.078 --> 00:08:17.080 position:50% align:center
[SIR NIGHTEYE] As you
investigate possible locations,

00:08:17.163 --> 00:08:19.582 position:50% align:center
consider the following criteria.

00:08:19.666 --> 00:08:21.543 position:50% align:center
One: Is this a place where

00:08:21.626 --> 00:08:25.672 position:50% align:center
Quirk-destroying bullets
could be manufactured?

00:08:25.755 --> 00:08:30.468 position:50% align:center
Two: Do people and goods
go in and out frequently?

00:08:30.552 --> 00:08:36.141 position:50% align:center
Three: Has the area seen a
recent influx in illegal drugs?

00:08:36.224 --> 00:08:38.518 position:50% align:center
Hassaikai has a plan in place.

00:08:38.601 --> 00:08:42.147 position:50% align:center
They're working quickly
and quietly to carry it out.

00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:45.775 position:50% align:center
We must proceed with
utmost care moving forward.

00:08:47.736 --> 00:08:51.906 position:50% align:center
[GRAN TORINO] Tsukauchi,
how are things on your end?

00:08:51.990 --> 00:08:54.159 position:50% align:center
All right, keep looking
and let us know

00:08:54.242 --> 00:08:56.578 position:50% align:center
what you find.

00:08:56.661 --> 00:08:59.539 position:50% align:center
The first half of the
list turned up nothing.

00:08:59.622 --> 00:09:02.167 position:50% align:center
They've gotta be hiding
the girl somewhere.

00:09:18.683 --> 00:09:23.813 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Hurry. Please hurry. Find her.

00:09:27.025 --> 00:09:29.361 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Find out where Eri is!

00:09:45.877 --> 00:09:49.005 position:50% align:center
--[phone vibrates]
--[gasps]

00:09:56.471 --> 00:09:58.932 position:50% align:center
All right. You, too?

00:09:59.015 --> 00:10:00.517 position:50% align:center
We got it.

00:10:03.353 --> 00:10:04.854 position:50% align:center
It's happening.

00:10:07.607 --> 00:10:10.652 position:50% align:center
With that many people out
looking, it went pretty quickly.

00:10:13.363 --> 00:10:14.656 position:50% align:center
[AMAJIKI]
Mirio.

00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:19.411 position:50% align:center

00:10:22.372 --> 00:10:24.207 position:50% align:center
Let's do our best.

00:10:26.793 --> 00:10:28.211 position:50% align:center
[MIRIO]
Eri.

00:10:28.294 --> 00:10:31.172 position:50% align:center
We'll protect you this time.

00:10:31.256 --> 00:10:33.216 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
We'll save you, Eri!

00:10:37.721 --> 00:10:39.305 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU, MIRIO]
I promise!

00:10:48.898 --> 00:10:50.275 position:50% align:center
[WEATHER FORECASTER 70AA]
Well, it looks like

00:10:50.358 --> 00:10:51.860 position:50% align:center
we're in for sunshine
today, so get out there

00:10:51.943 --> 00:10:54.696 position:50% align:center
and enjoy the nice
weather. In the eve--

00:10:54.779 --> 00:10:57.449 position:50% align:center
[SERO] I know Tokoyami's
still off in Kyushu,

00:10:57.532 --> 00:11:00.076 position:50% align:center
but I wonder where the rest
of the work study students are.

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:01.369 position:50% align:center
Yeah, it's strange.

00:11:01.453 --> 00:11:03.246 position:50% align:center
Midoriya's been acting
weird lately, too.

00:11:03.329 --> 00:11:05.248 position:50% align:center
I know! Did you see
him this morning?

00:11:05.331 --> 00:11:08.209 position:50% align:center
[OJIRO] Uh-huh. He was
staring at his food

00:11:08.293 --> 00:11:11.129 position:50% align:center
with this super-intense
look on his face.

00:11:11.212 --> 00:11:13.423 position:50% align:center
And it wasn't only Deku, either.

00:11:13.506 --> 00:11:15.675 position:50% align:center
The other three looked
really serious, too.

00:11:15.759 --> 00:11:17.761 position:50% align:center
Like something big
was about to happen.

00:11:17.844 --> 00:11:20.221 position:50% align:center
You guys think what they've been
doing out there's dangerous?

00:11:20.305 --> 00:11:22.766 position:50% align:center
Even if it is, they'll
be with pros, right?

00:11:22.849 --> 00:11:23.892 position:50% align:center
That's true.

00:11:23.975 --> 00:11:26.186 position:50% align:center
There's probably
nothin' to worry about.

00:11:27.228 --> 00:11:28.521 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:11:28.605 --> 00:11:30.648 position:50% align:center
They're keeping this Eri
girl in their stronghold?

00:11:30.732 --> 00:11:33.276 position:50% align:center
[FATGUM]
And by stronghold, you mean...

00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:35.445 position:50% align:center
The headquarters
of the Hassaikai.

00:11:35.528 --> 00:11:37.030 position:50% align:center
It's their leader's residence.

00:11:37.113 --> 00:11:39.324 position:50% align:center
[sighs] So you're tellin'
me all that time we spent

00:11:39.407 --> 00:11:40.950 position:50% align:center
investigating was
for nothing then?

00:11:41.034 --> 00:11:43.912 position:50% align:center
Not at all, we gained plenty
of new information as well.

00:11:43.995 --> 00:11:46.081 position:50% align:center
How'd you confirm
she was there?

00:11:49.376 --> 00:11:50.919 position:50% align:center
A member of the
Hassaikai visited

00:11:51.002 --> 00:11:53.338 position:50% align:center
a nearby department
store the other day.

00:11:53.421 --> 00:11:55.632 position:50% align:center
He purchased a toy
favored by young girls.

00:11:55.715 --> 00:11:56.508 position:50% align:center
What?

00:11:56.591 --> 00:11:57.759 position:50% align:center
That's pretty sparkly.

00:11:57.842 --> 00:12:00.220 position:50% align:center
Listen, maybe the guy
just likes cutesy stuff.

00:12:00.303 --> 00:12:02.597 position:50% align:center
Different strokes for
different folks, Nighteye.

00:12:02.681 --> 00:12:05.100 position:50% align:center
You wanna tell us what you're
doin' with one, though?

00:12:05.183 --> 00:12:07.852 position:50% align:center
Yes. I was there when
he made the purchase

00:12:07.936 --> 00:12:11.981 position:50% align:center
and overheard his conversation
with the store clerk.

00:12:12.065 --> 00:12:14.484 position:50% align:center
[CARETAKER 69A] Hey, uh...
What's that show little girls

00:12:14.567 --> 00:12:17.487 position:50% align:center
are into these days?
Glitter somethin' or other?

00:12:17.570 --> 00:12:18.822 position:50% align:center
Oh, sure, I wonder
if you could be

00:12:18.905 --> 00:12:20.323 position:50% align:center
thinking about <i>Glitter</i>
<i>Squad</i> , maybe?

00:12:20.407 --> 00:12:22.450 position:50% align:center
[CARETAKER 69A] Yeah, that's
the one! I remember now.

00:12:22.534 --> 00:12:24.744 position:50% align:center
It's <i>Squad Action!</i>
<i>Glitter Squad!</i>

00:12:24.828 --> 00:12:26.663 position:50% align:center
So, you, uh, got any of those?

00:12:26.746 --> 00:12:27.997 position:50% align:center
[STORE CLERK 70AA]
Oh, I'm sorry, sir,

00:12:28.081 --> 00:12:29.249 position:50% align:center
the <i>Squad Action! Glitter Squad!</i>

00:12:29.332 --> 00:12:31.418 position:50% align:center
series was from a
number of years ago.

00:12:31.501 --> 00:12:34.129 position:50% align:center
The current series is
<i>Gung-Ho! Glitter Squad Ten!</i>

00:12:34.212 --> 00:12:38.133 position:50% align:center
Really? Okay.
Where're those, then?

00:12:38.216 --> 00:12:40.051 position:50% align:center
[SIR NIGHTEYE]
They're right over here.

00:12:40.135 --> 00:12:41.970 position:50% align:center
Whoa, where'd you come from?

00:12:42.053 --> 00:12:44.597 position:50% align:center
You were asking
about <i>Glitter Squad</i> .

00:12:44.681 --> 00:12:46.307 position:50% align:center
I'm a fan, too.

00:13:01.698 --> 00:13:03.908 position:50% align:center
[LOCKLOCK] You ended up
using Foresight anyway?

00:13:03.992 --> 00:13:05.910 position:50% align:center
If you recall,
I said I'd use it when

00:13:05.994 --> 00:13:07.829 position:50% align:center
our path was more certain.

00:13:07.912 --> 00:13:10.707 position:50% align:center
Whatever, this means we've got
the data we need, right?

00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:12.542 position:50% align:center
[CENTIPEDER]
Yes. And we know for sure

00:13:12.625 --> 00:13:15.587 position:50% align:center
when they'll be there
thanks to our stakeouts.

00:13:15.670 --> 00:13:16.880 position:50% align:center
We also worked with the police

00:13:16.963 --> 00:13:20.133 position:50% align:center
and already got a warrant
to search the place!

00:13:20.216 --> 00:13:21.134 position:50% align:center
Next step...

00:13:21.217 --> 00:13:22.761 position:50% align:center
...is to barge in there!

00:13:22.844 --> 00:13:25.930 position:50% align:center
Aw, man! That's my line!

00:13:26.014 --> 00:13:27.557 position:50% align:center
[OCHACO]
Hey, Deku.

00:13:32.395 --> 00:13:34.272 position:50% align:center
[MIRIO]
Come on, Midoriya.

00:13:36.900 --> 00:13:38.610 position:50% align:center
We're all over this!
Let's rescue that girl!

00:13:38.693 --> 00:13:39.569 position:50% align:center
--Take down some 
--[IZUKU] What's with

00:13:39.652 --> 00:13:41.071 position:50% align:center
--bad guys! Yeah!
--those moves?

00:13:41.154 --> 00:13:44.199 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] Good, seems like
he's back to normal.

00:13:44.282 --> 00:13:46.368 position:50% align:center
[HADO]
Hey, hey. Look!

00:13:46.451 --> 00:13:49.829 position:50% align:center
[giggles]

00:13:49.913 --> 00:13:51.748 position:50% align:center
Aw, yeah!

00:13:54.084 --> 00:13:56.628 position:50% align:center
[SIR NIGHTEYE]
Mirio.

00:13:56.711 --> 00:13:58.046 position:50% align:center
You've been regretting
what happened

00:13:58.129 --> 00:14:01.716 position:50% align:center
in that alley this
whole time, haven't you?

00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:03.259 position:50% align:center
But I hope you know
it's only because

00:14:03.343 --> 00:14:05.220 position:50% align:center
you held your ground
that we were able

00:14:05.303 --> 00:14:08.139 position:50% align:center
to go into this mission
fully prepared.

00:14:09.641 --> 00:14:10.934 position:50% align:center
[SIR NIGHTEYE]
Regret and failure

00:14:11.017 --> 00:14:14.187 position:50% align:center
are an inevitable part of life.

00:14:14.270 --> 00:14:16.606 position:50% align:center
What's actually
important, though,

00:14:16.690 --> 00:14:18.858 position:50% align:center
is what you learn from them.

00:14:26.366 --> 00:14:27.951 position:50% align:center
[SIR NIGHTEYE]
I don't know if it's possible

00:14:28.034 --> 00:14:30.954 position:50% align:center
to change the future. But...

00:14:31.037 --> 00:14:34.833 position:50% align:center
...you can change the effect
the past has on you.

00:14:34.916 --> 00:14:37.252 position:50% align:center
By interpreting your history,

00:14:37.335 --> 00:14:41.256 position:50% align:center
it's possible to modify
how you view the present.

00:14:41.339 --> 00:14:44.592 position:50% align:center
Mirio. Shine.

00:14:44.676 --> 00:14:47.053 position:50% align:center
I know you're someone
who can do that!

00:14:50.348 --> 00:14:53.351 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
This time, for sure.

00:14:53.435 --> 00:14:54.811 position:50% align:center
[MIRIO]
For sure!

00:15:03.111 --> 00:15:05.447 position:50% align:center
Now, then. Let's begin.

00:15:10.452 --> 00:15:11.870 position:50% align:center
[HASSAIKAI MEMBER 70A]
Keep watch.

00:15:11.953 --> 00:15:14.039 position:50% align:center
A bunch of have been gathering
since early this morning.

00:15:14.122 --> 00:15:16.958 position:50% align:center
The police are backing them up.

00:15:17.042 --> 00:15:19.127 position:50% align:center
[KURONO] Boss. It sounds
like they've figured out

00:15:19.210 --> 00:15:20.420 position:50% align:center
where we are.

00:15:20.503 --> 00:15:22.505 position:50% align:center
[CHISAKI]
So, they're coming.

00:15:22.589 --> 00:15:24.174 position:50% align:center
Proceed according to plan.

00:15:24.257 --> 00:15:25.967 position:50% align:center
[KURONO]
You got it, sir.

00:15:26.051 --> 00:15:27.594 position:50% align:center
[CHISAKI]
Prepare yourself.

00:15:27.677 --> 00:15:29.679 position:50% align:center
[MIMIC]
Right.

00:15:29.763 --> 00:15:32.474 position:50% align:center
[KURONO]
Where are you going?

00:15:32.557 --> 00:15:34.684 position:50% align:center
[CHISAKI]
To take care of something.

00:15:38.063 --> 00:15:39.981 position:50% align:center
[DETECTIVE 70A] As you know,
Nighteye was able to use

00:15:40.065 --> 00:15:42.317 position:50% align:center
his Quirk on a Hassaikai member.

00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:44.569 position:50% align:center
Through it, he saw
underground facilities,

00:15:44.652 --> 00:15:45.612 position:50% align:center
and we believe them to be

00:15:45.695 --> 00:15:47.864 position:50% align:center
this Yakuza
group's headquarters.

00:15:47.947 --> 00:15:49.157 position:50% align:center
We were also able to confirm

00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:50.658 position:50% align:center
that the girl we're
trying to rescue

00:15:50.742 --> 00:15:53.745 position:50% align:center
is currently being held
in one of the rooms there.

00:15:53.828 --> 00:15:55.121 position:50% align:center
[DETECTIVE 70A] Although
we were unable to map out

00:15:55.205 --> 00:15:57.916 position:50% align:center
the entire layout of the
underground hallways,

00:15:57.999 --> 00:15:59.834 position:50% align:center
we believe the man
Sir Nighteye saw

00:15:59.918 --> 00:16:02.295 position:50% align:center
took the shortest route
to our target.

00:16:02.379 --> 00:16:04.130 position:50% align:center
This is the best intel
we have at the moment,

00:16:04.214 --> 00:16:06.299 position:50% align:center
concerning the
Hassaikai's stronghold.

00:16:06.383 --> 00:16:08.760 position:50% align:center
It's the basis of this mission.

00:16:08.843 --> 00:16:10.053 position:50% align:center
Stay smart.

00:16:10.136 --> 00:16:11.805 position:50% align:center
These guys are dangerous,
and we can expect them

00:16:11.888 --> 00:16:15.141 position:50% align:center
to bring their Quirks
against us, full force.

00:16:15.225 --> 00:16:16.643 position:50% align:center
We're passing around
a list of current

00:16:16.726 --> 00:16:18.561 position:50% align:center
Hassaikai members
and their Quirks

00:16:18.645 --> 00:16:21.439 position:50% align:center
according to our
registration databases.

00:16:21.523 --> 00:16:23.024 position:50% align:center
Commit this to memory.

00:16:23.108 --> 00:16:25.026 position:50% align:center
It's solid information
to have on hand.

00:16:25.110 --> 00:16:26.444 position:50% align:center
Thank you for this.

00:16:26.528 --> 00:16:28.113 position:50% align:center
[DETECTIVE 70A] We don't wanna
give them time to hide.

00:16:28.196 --> 00:16:30.615 position:50% align:center
Our aim is to identify and
apprehend all members

00:16:30.699 --> 00:16:33.743 position:50% align:center
as quickly as possible
while securing our target.

00:16:33.827 --> 00:16:35.704 position:50% align:center
Things are moving
fast now, huh?

00:16:35.787 --> 00:16:39.290 position:50% align:center
You're energetic,
considering how early it is.

00:16:39.374 --> 00:16:41.126 position:50% align:center
[OCHACO]
I'm getting nervous.

00:16:41.209 --> 00:16:42.919 position:50% align:center
No joke, first detective work,

00:16:43.003 --> 00:16:45.547 position:50% align:center
and now we're cooperating
with the police.

00:16:45.630 --> 00:16:46.881 position:50% align:center
There's so much I don't know.

00:16:46.965 --> 00:16:49.259 position:50% align:center
Right? So official!

00:16:49.342 --> 00:16:51.845 position:50% align:center
That's true. Schools don't
always prepare you

00:16:51.928 --> 00:16:53.805 position:50% align:center
for investigations like this.

00:16:53.888 --> 00:16:55.890 position:50% align:center
It takes some time to adjust.

00:16:55.974 --> 00:16:57.225 position:50% align:center
[KESAGIRI MAN]
She's right.

00:16:57.308 --> 00:16:59.394 position:50% align:center
All the pros seem like
they're pretty chill, huh?

00:16:59.477 --> 00:17:00.895 position:50% align:center
So brave!

00:17:00.979 --> 00:17:04.482 position:50% align:center
Hey. I haven't seen Gran Torino
around here this morning.

00:17:04.566 --> 00:17:06.109 position:50% align:center
Do you know where he is?

00:17:06.192 --> 00:17:08.486 position:50% align:center
[SIR NIGHTEYE] Apparently,
he won't be joining us today.

00:17:08.570 --> 00:17:09.738 position:50% align:center
Uh-- Sir?

00:17:09.821 --> 00:17:12.115 position:50% align:center
Tsukauchi's been keeping
an eye on the League.

00:17:12.198 --> 00:17:14.659 position:50% align:center
According to him, it looks
like they're on the move.

00:17:14.743 --> 00:17:16.661 position:50% align:center
Fortunately, we have
plenty of heroes here,

00:17:16.745 --> 00:17:18.538 position:50% align:center
so we can afford
to send Gran Torino.

00:17:18.621 --> 00:17:20.040 position:50% align:center
I see.

00:17:20.123 --> 00:17:21.875 position:50% align:center
Maybe we can take
down the Hassaikai

00:17:21.958 --> 00:17:23.918 position:50% align:center
and the League of Villains
at the same time!

00:17:24.002 --> 00:17:25.462 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah!

00:17:27.130 --> 00:17:28.298 position:50% align:center
Let's go.
