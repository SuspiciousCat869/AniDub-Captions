Not good.

00:11:13.298 --> 00:11:15.925 position:50% align:center
[SIR NIGHTEYE]
You needn't worry.

00:11:16.009 --> 00:11:21.014 position:50% align:center
You three are safe.
At least for the time being.

00:11:21.097 --> 00:11:24.434 position:50% align:center
He's not going to
target any of us.

00:11:24.517 --> 00:11:28.104 position:50% align:center
He'll head to the surface
in pursuit of Midoriya.

00:11:28.188 --> 00:11:29.981 position:50% align:center
And Eri.

00:11:30.065 --> 00:11:36.154 position:50% align:center
Then he'll kill
Midoriya. And escape.

00:11:36.237 --> 00:11:39.324 position:50% align:center
[gasps] We can't let him--

00:11:43.161 --> 00:11:47.123 position:50% align:center
[OCHACO] I want to move,
but I'm so weak!

00:11:47.207 --> 00:11:48.958 position:50% align:center
Deku!

00:11:54.839 --> 00:11:57.759 position:50% align:center
[SIR NIGHTEYE]
I foresaw it.

00:11:57.842 --> 00:11:59.969 position:50% align:center
We can't just sit
here and do nothing!

00:12:00.053 --> 00:12:02.097 position:50% align:center
[SIR NIGHTEYE]
Given the shape you're all in,

00:12:02.180 --> 00:12:05.600 position:50% align:center
you cannot stop him. I'm sorry.

00:12:05.684 --> 00:12:08.978 position:50% align:center
[OCHACO]
That doesn't matter.

00:12:09.062 --> 00:12:13.483 position:50% align:center
I have to do something
and help him.

00:12:13.566 --> 00:12:18.279 position:50% align:center
There is no future
except the one you create.

00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:22.158 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Even if it's set in stone,

00:12:22.242 --> 00:12:24.828 position:50% align:center
I'll smash that future!

00:12:29.541 --> 00:12:31.459 position:50% align:center
--[SIR NIGHTEYE] Froppy.
--Ribbit?

00:12:31.543 --> 00:12:33.545 position:50% align:center
You go help Mirio.

00:12:33.628 --> 00:12:35.964 position:50% align:center
He's on the other
side of the wall.

00:12:36.047 --> 00:12:37.507 position:50% align:center
Through that hole.

00:12:37.590 --> 00:12:39.676 position:50% align:center
Uravity. Ryukyu.

00:12:39.759 --> 00:12:42.429 position:50% align:center
I need your aid.

00:12:42.512 --> 00:12:45.890 position:50% align:center
Take me... to the surface.

00:12:48.268 --> 00:12:52.689 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] My body's on fire!
Wait, now it's cold.

00:12:52.772 --> 00:12:56.735 position:50% align:center
I used all of my
power, but I'm okay.

00:12:56.818 --> 00:12:58.611 position:50% align:center
My bones are intact!

00:12:58.695 --> 00:13:01.948 position:50% align:center
In fact, even my injuries
from before are gone.

00:13:05.535 --> 00:13:07.829 position:50% align:center
Is this your power at work?

00:13:07.912 --> 00:13:10.957 position:50% align:center
Are you a healer?

00:13:11.041 --> 00:13:13.918 position:50% align:center
--[heartbeats]
--[groaning]

00:13:14.002 --> 00:13:15.420 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
What's happening?

00:13:15.503 --> 00:13:18.298 position:50% align:center
It's like my body is being
pulled apart from the inside.

00:13:18.381 --> 00:13:21.092 position:50% align:center
[CHISAKI]
She has no control over it.

00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:30.518 position:50% align:center
[CHISAKI] She may have
activated her Quirk in time,

00:13:30.602 --> 00:13:32.937 position:50% align:center
but she doesn't know
how to turn it off.

00:13:33.021 --> 00:13:35.190 position:50% align:center
Isn't that right, Eri?

00:13:35.273 --> 00:13:38.109 position:50% align:center
She has the power
to rewind people.

00:13:38.193 --> 00:13:39.569 position:50% align:center
That's her secret.

00:13:39.652 --> 00:13:41.571 position:50% align:center
Use her right, and you
might even be able

00:13:41.654 --> 00:13:44.449 position:50% align:center
to turn someone
back into a monkey.

00:13:44.532 --> 00:13:46.618 position:50% align:center
If you keep carrying
her like that,

00:13:46.701 --> 00:13:48.495 position:50% align:center
you'll be annihilated.

00:13:48.578 --> 00:13:52.374 position:50% align:center
Everyone who touches her
is rewound into nothingness.

00:13:52.457 --> 00:13:55.502 position:50% align:center
Didn't I tell you that
the girl is cursed?

00:13:55.585 --> 00:13:56.961 position:50% align:center
Hand her over.

00:13:57.045 --> 00:14:00.173 position:50% align:center
The only way to stop her
is to disassemble her.

00:14:00.256 --> 00:14:03.843 position:50% align:center
Or did you want to be
wiped out of existence?

00:14:03.927 --> 00:14:07.430 position:50% align:center
'Kay, Eri. Hold on.

00:14:07.514 --> 00:14:10.433 position:50% align:center
So that's it. The
moment my leg was hurt,

00:14:10.517 --> 00:14:13.436 position:50% align:center
you rewound it back
to before it was broken.

00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:17.023 position:50% align:center
I never even felt the pain.

00:14:17.107 --> 00:14:20.193 position:50% align:center
It seems to me your Quirk
is a blessing, Eri!

00:14:23.113 --> 00:14:25.949 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] I understand
her power's effects now.

00:14:26.032 --> 00:14:29.285 position:50% align:center
And how fast her rewind works.

00:14:29.369 --> 00:14:32.247 position:50% align:center
So, I just have to keep
smashing myself up

00:14:32.330 --> 00:14:35.875 position:50% align:center
at a greater speed
than she heals me.

00:14:35.959 --> 00:14:39.170 position:50% align:center
One For All, Full Cowling!

00:14:39.254 --> 00:14:41.673 position:50% align:center
One Hundred Percent!

00:14:41.756 --> 00:14:45.135 position:50% align:center
Eri, will you please
lend me your power?

00:14:49.055 --> 00:14:53.184 position:50% align:center
[CHISAKI] Neither of you realize
the true value of her ability.

00:14:53.268 --> 00:14:57.605 position:50% align:center
Quirks get exponentially
stronger as you develop them.

00:14:57.689 --> 00:15:00.483 position:50% align:center
By conducting
countless experiments.

00:15:00.567 --> 00:15:03.862 position:50% align:center
I extracted Eri's power
and I distilled it

00:15:03.945 --> 00:15:06.072 position:50% align:center
into its ultimate form.

00:15:06.156 --> 00:15:10.410 position:50% align:center
As a result, it doesn't stop
at simply rewinding the flesh.

00:15:10.493 --> 00:15:13.079 position:50% align:center
It works on a much
grander scale.

00:15:13.163 --> 00:15:15.373 position:50% align:center
It rewinds the course
of the species

00:15:15.457 --> 00:15:18.251 position:50% align:center
to a time before
Quirks ever existed.

00:15:18.335 --> 00:15:22.255 position:50% align:center
Can't you see?
Eri represents change.

00:15:24.007 --> 00:15:25.967 position:50% align:center
[CHISAKI]
The ability to annihilate Quirks

00:15:26.051 --> 00:15:30.138 position:50% align:center
once and for all and change
humanity back to normal!

00:15:30.221 --> 00:15:33.725 position:50% align:center
With her powers, I can end
this infected society.

00:15:33.808 --> 00:15:36.102 position:50% align:center
Cure this hero sickness!

00:15:36.186 --> 00:15:38.313 position:50% align:center
She is mine.

00:15:38.396 --> 00:15:41.858 position:50% align:center
A naive little boy like you
doesn't know how to use her.

00:15:41.941 --> 00:15:44.694 position:50% align:center
It's up to me to cure humanity.

00:15:50.158 --> 00:15:51.451 position:50% align:center
[CHISAKI gasps]

00:15:53.161 --> 00:15:55.955 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Smash!

00:16:01.294 --> 00:16:04.839 position:50% align:center
[TOGA]
Dang, Izuku. Nice.

00:16:04.923 --> 00:16:06.758 position:50% align:center
[TWICE]
Hey, what's Compress doing?

00:16:06.841 --> 00:16:08.051 position:50% align:center
[MR. COMPRESS grunts]

00:16:09.302 --> 00:16:11.137 position:50% align:center
Go on, Uravity!

00:16:11.221 --> 00:16:12.764 position:50% align:center
Get Nighteye to an ambulance!

00:16:12.847 --> 00:16:15.558 position:50% align:center
Try to keep the spike
stabilized in his stomach.

00:16:20.230 --> 00:16:21.523 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU grunts]

00:16:21.606 --> 00:16:24.567 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] Eri's power
has gotten even stronger.

00:16:24.651 --> 00:16:27.821 position:50% align:center
Chisaki said she doesn't
know how to stop her Quirk.

00:16:27.904 --> 00:16:29.739 position:50% align:center
Just like when I
first used One For All

00:16:29.823 --> 00:16:31.950 position:50% align:center
and had no idea
how to control it.

00:16:32.033 --> 00:16:34.703 position:50% align:center
He hasn't given her any
training or guidance.

00:16:34.786 --> 00:16:37.038 position:50% align:center
So she's completely lost.

00:16:42.168 --> 00:16:43.962 position:50% align:center
[BOSS 74A]
Chisaki.

00:16:44.045 --> 00:16:47.298 position:50% align:center
I'm told that you
started another brawl.

00:16:47.382 --> 00:16:50.218 position:50% align:center
Your opponent's
in critical condition.

00:16:50.301 --> 00:16:53.763 position:50% align:center
[CHISAKI] I just laid out a punk
who was moving in on our turf.

00:16:53.847 --> 00:16:58.143 position:50% align:center
Trying to save our
plummeting reputation.

00:16:58.226 --> 00:17:00.186 position:50% align:center
We have to set an
example so they know

00:17:00.270 --> 00:17:01.604 position:50% align:center
who's boss around here.

00:17:01.688 --> 00:17:03.773 position:50% align:center
[BOSS 74A]
Is that so?

00:17:03.857 --> 00:17:07.777 position:50% align:center
I know you started a new
racket without my approval.

00:17:07.861 --> 00:17:11.406 position:50% align:center
I told you not to get
involved with drugs.

00:17:13.658 --> 00:17:15.368 position:50% align:center
Listen, I appreciate
that you're trying

00:17:15.452 --> 00:17:18.204 position:50% align:center
to repay me for taking you in.

00:17:18.288 --> 00:17:22.959 position:50% align:center
But... you always take
things too far, Chisaki.

00:17:23.043 --> 00:17:27.339 position:50% align:center
Don't stray from the path
I've laid before you.

00:17:27.422 --> 00:17:32.177 position:50% align:center
[CHISAKI] Obsolete yakuza ideals
won't save the organization.

00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:35.013 position:50% align:center
Why doesn't the
old man understand?

00:17:35.096 --> 00:17:38.558 position:50% align:center
[KURONO] Well, you have
to admit, the idea of yakuza

00:17:38.641 --> 00:17:40.477 position:50% align:center
once again ruling the
underworld does sound

00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:44.230 position:50% align:center
more like a dream
than a reality.

00:17:44.314 --> 00:17:47.275 position:50% align:center
[CHISAKI]
I'll make it happen. Just wait.

00:17:47.359 --> 00:17:49.319 position:50% align:center
[CHISAKI]
If my plan succeeds,

00:17:49.402 --> 00:17:52.822 position:50% align:center
there'll be no stopping
the Shie Hassaikai.

00:17:54.157 --> 00:17:56.785 position:50% align:center
[CHISAKI] First, during
the research phase,

00:17:56.868 --> 00:17:59.454 position:50% align:center
we'll release some of
the unfinished product.

00:17:59.537 --> 00:18:03.541 position:50% align:center
Let people catch a whiff.
A drug that depowers heroes?

00:18:03.625 --> 00:18:06.086 position:50% align:center
It'll be irresistible.

00:18:06.169 --> 00:18:09.297 position:50% align:center
And once we've established
a hunger for it,

00:18:09.381 --> 00:18:13.176 position:50% align:center
we'll sell the finished
product at exorbitant prices.

00:18:13.259 --> 00:18:16.262 position:50% align:center
Then, we'll introduce a
counterdrug to the heroes

00:18:16.346 --> 00:18:19.557 position:50% align:center
that uses rewind to
restore a lost Quirk.

00:18:19.641 --> 00:18:22.560 position:50% align:center
While we sell the
bullets to the villains,

00:18:22.644 --> 00:18:24.896 position:50% align:center
we'll sell the
serum to the heroes.

00:18:24.979 --> 00:18:27.607 position:50% align:center
And since Eri's flesh is
the source of the drug,

00:18:27.691 --> 00:18:30.235 position:50% align:center
we'll have a complete
monopoly on the market!

00:18:30.318 --> 00:18:33.238 position:50% align:center
Then Shie Hassaikai
will once again rule Japan

00:18:33.321 --> 00:18:35.907 position:50% align:center
--from the shadows.
--[BOSS 74A] Chisaki.

00:18:35.990 --> 00:18:38.993 position:50% align:center
I told you to forget about this.

00:18:39.077 --> 00:18:41.246 position:50% align:center
She's a child.

00:18:41.329 --> 00:18:44.499 position:50% align:center
Have you completely
lost your humanity?

00:18:44.582 --> 00:18:47.335 position:50% align:center
If you're set on going
against our ideals,

00:18:47.419 --> 00:18:51.548 position:50% align:center
then... you have no place here.

00:18:56.011 --> 00:19:00.265 position:50% align:center
[CHISAKI] You don't get it.
You took me in.

00:19:00.348 --> 00:19:03.435 position:50% align:center
I just want to repay you.

00:19:03.518 --> 00:19:04.728 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:19:04.811 --> 00:19:09.566 position:50% align:center
[CHISAKI] Not to worry.
Just lay back and relax.

00:19:12.152 --> 00:19:14.154 position:50% align:center
[CHISAKI]
I owe you everything.

00:19:14.237 --> 00:19:17.407 position:50% align:center
You were strong,
but those diseased heroes

00:19:17.490 --> 00:19:19.868 position:50% align:center
backed you into a corner.

00:19:19.951 --> 00:19:23.163 position:50% align:center
Once my plan is on track,
I'll repair you.

00:19:23.246 --> 00:19:27.834 position:50% align:center
And you'll thank me
for what I've done.

00:19:27.917 --> 00:19:29.502 position:50% align:center
Pops.

00:19:35.383 --> 00:19:41.473 position:50% align:center
[CHISAKI] Why doesn't anybody
see the big picture?

00:19:41.556 --> 00:19:44.976 position:50% align:center
I'm going to tear down
this entire world.

00:19:45.060 --> 00:19:47.896 position:50% align:center
Destroy its very foundation.

00:19:47.979 --> 00:19:50.565 position:50% align:center
You're all blinded by
some outdated sense

00:19:50.648 --> 00:19:55.153 position:50% align:center
of what's "right." You're just
pretending to be heroes!

00:19:55.236 --> 00:19:58.698 position:50% align:center
I won't let you stand in my way!

00:20:08.667 --> 00:20:10.710 position:50% align:center
If I can't save Eri...

00:20:12.504 --> 00:20:16.216 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] ...one small child who's
relying on me to help her...

00:20:18.259 --> 00:20:22.013 position:50% align:center
[CHISAKI yells]

00:20:23.682 --> 00:20:26.518 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
...then how can I call myself

00:20:26.601 --> 00:20:29.437 position:50% align:center
a hero who saves everybody?

00:20:46.830 --> 00:20:50.375 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
That's who I'm gonna be!

00:21:03.555 --> 00:21:05.265 position:50% align:center
Where is he?

00:21:05.348 --> 00:21:07.017 position:50% align:center
Nighteye?

00:21:07.100 --> 00:21:10.729 position:50% align:center
[gasps] But, I saw it.

00:21:10.812 --> 00:21:13.940 position:50% align:center
Chisaki succeeded and escaped,

00:21:14.024 --> 00:21:18.862 position:50% align:center
while Midoriya lost his life.

00:21:18.945 --> 00:21:25.702 position:50% align:center
That is immutable future.
I saw it so clearly.

00:21:29.748 --> 00:21:37.005 position:50% align:center
[SIR NIGHTEYE] But this is new.
A different set of events.

00:21:40.467 --> 00:21:46.139 position:50% align:center
[SIR NIGHTEYE] Does that mean
that the future can be changed?

00:21:47.182 --> 00:21:50.185 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] Even if it's
already been decided.

00:21:50.268 --> 00:21:53.229 position:50% align:center
Even if it's set in stone,

00:21:53.313 --> 00:21:55.398 position:50% align:center
I'll smash that future!

00:23:29.534 --> 00:23:30.910 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Here's the preview!

00:23:30.994 --> 00:23:33.580 position:50% align:center
I succeeded in taking
Chisaki down.

00:23:33.663 --> 00:23:36.833 position:50% align:center
Though I couldn't have done it
without Eri's Rewind power.

00:23:36.916 --> 00:23:38.793 position:50% align:center
We may have won this fight,

00:23:38.877 --> 00:23:41.671 position:50% align:center
but our success came
at a horrible cost.

00:23:41.755 --> 00:23:44.883 position:50% align:center
Amajiki. Fatgum. Locklock.

00:23:44.966 --> 00:23:49.888 position:50% align:center
Kirishima. Asui.
Uraraka. Mr. Aizawa.

00:23:49.971 --> 00:23:52.515 position:50% align:center
And the one who
sacrificed the most.

00:23:52.599 --> 00:23:54.851 position:50% align:center
Next time: "Bright Future."

00:23:54.934 --> 00:23:57.437 position:50% align:center
Go beyond. Plus Ultra!
