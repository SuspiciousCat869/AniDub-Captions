[AMAJIKI]
In the spring of third grade,

00:00:12.804 --> 00:00:16.433 position:50% align:center
I transferred to a new school
on the first day of class.

00:00:16.516 --> 00:00:23.023 position:50% align:center
I'm Amajiki, and, uh...
And I like her-- I mean...

00:00:23.106 --> 00:00:27.277 position:50% align:center
[AMAJIKI] I could barely talk
when I introduced myself.

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:30.113 position:50% align:center
It was a new school year,
but plenty of students

00:00:30.196 --> 00:00:32.699 position:50% align:center
knew each other from
the previous term,

00:00:32.782 --> 00:00:35.368 position:50% align:center
and they clustered
together in groups.

00:00:35.452 --> 00:00:37.579 position:50% align:center
It seemed like nobody
wanted to be the first one

00:00:37.662 --> 00:00:38.955 position:50% align:center
to talk to the new
kid who'd already

00:00:39.039 --> 00:00:41.750 position:50% align:center
embarrassed himself,
and making friends

00:00:41.833 --> 00:00:45.754 position:50% align:center
wasn't exactly my specialty.

00:00:45.837 --> 00:00:47.922 position:50% align:center
After all, who would
wanna get to know

00:00:48.006 --> 00:00:50.508 position:50% align:center
someone boring and
awkward like me?

00:00:50.592 --> 00:00:52.218 position:50% align:center
[MIRIO]
Amajiki!

00:00:52.302 --> 00:00:54.346 position:50% align:center
It was kinda hard to hear
what you were tryin' to say

00:00:54.429 --> 00:00:56.264 position:50% align:center
up there earlier,
but I was thinking.

00:00:56.348 --> 00:00:58.266 position:50% align:center
Were you trying to tell us
that you like heroes,

00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:59.309 position:50% align:center
was that it?

00:00:59.392 --> 00:01:02.729 position:50% align:center
Well... I, uh...

00:01:02.812 --> 00:01:05.940 position:50% align:center
'Cause I like 'em, too.
They're so awesome!

00:01:08.651 --> 00:01:10.195 position:50% align:center
[AMAJIKI]
That day...

00:01:10.278 --> 00:01:12.739 position:50% align:center
If you had to pick a
favorite, who would it be?

00:01:12.822 --> 00:01:16.117 position:50% align:center
[AMAJIKI] You talked to me
when no one else would.

00:01:16.201 --> 00:01:19.829 position:50% align:center
And I remember thinking
how warm you were.

00:01:19.913 --> 00:01:22.874 position:50% align:center
How bright.

00:01:22.957 --> 00:01:26.419 position:50% align:center
You were shining like the sun.

00:01:29.005 --> 00:01:33.259 position:50% align:center
[YAKUZA yelling]

00:01:36.262 --> 00:01:40.225 position:50% align:center
[AMAJIKI]
I wonder. Can I do it, too?

00:01:42.811 --> 00:01:46.773 position:50% align:center
[AMAJIKI] Can I shine
as brightly as you do?

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:24.746 position:50% align:center
[DETECTIVE 70A]
We have a warrant to search

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:26.998 position:50% align:center
your premises on
suspicion of manufacture

00:03:27.082 --> 00:03:28.458 position:50% align:center
and sale of illegal drugs!

00:03:28.541 --> 00:03:30.085 position:50% align:center
[HASSAIKAI MEMBER 71A]
Get the hell outta here!

00:03:30.168 --> 00:03:32.337 position:50% align:center
Yeah, what do you want
with us anyway?

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:34.673 position:50% align:center
[POLICE OFFICER 71A] You heard
him. We have a warrant.

00:03:34.756 --> 00:03:36.383 position:50% align:center
Everyone please calm down!

00:03:36.466 --> 00:03:37.634 position:50% align:center
[KESAGIRI MAN]
Clear a path!

00:03:37.717 --> 00:03:40.387 position:50% align:center
Consider the consequences
before you resist!

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:42.347 position:50% align:center
[MASKED HERO] They're going
to gut the whole organization

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:43.890 position:50% align:center
just to buy some time?

00:03:43.973 --> 00:03:45.433 position:50% align:center
Just leave the ones
out here to us!

00:03:45.517 --> 00:03:46.810 position:50% align:center
You go inside!

00:03:46.893 --> 00:03:48.395 position:50% align:center
[SIR NIGHTEYE]
Good luck!

00:03:48.478 --> 00:03:51.606 position:50% align:center
Hate to just barge in like this.
But, we're kind of in a hurry!

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:54.484 position:50% align:center
Haven't seen any signs
of suspicious activity yet!

00:03:54.567 --> 00:03:57.153 position:50% align:center
Same here. But, hey,
we're in it now, right?

00:03:57.237 --> 00:03:59.989 position:50% align:center
We got no choice but
to see it through.

00:04:00.073 --> 00:04:02.826 position:50% align:center
Is it possible that somebody
leaked our plans for the raid?

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:04.994 position:50% align:center
There must be a reason they all
came pouring out like that.

00:04:05.078 --> 00:04:06.496 position:50% align:center
No, if there had been a leak,

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:08.832 position:50% align:center
I think they would be
fighting more cohesively.

00:04:08.915 --> 00:04:11.876 position:50% align:center
Groups like this are used
to working together.

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:13.586 position:50% align:center
There's nothing that
matters more to these guys

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:15.880 position:50% align:center
than their bond with their
boss and their brothers.

00:04:15.964 --> 00:04:17.841 position:50% align:center
Being part of the underworld
only makes loyalty

00:04:17.924 --> 00:04:20.093 position:50% align:center
that much more sacred to them.

00:04:20.176 --> 00:04:22.637 position:50% align:center
All those people outside,
but we haven't caught

00:04:22.721 --> 00:04:24.639 position:50% align:center
sight of the top brass yet.

00:04:24.723 --> 00:04:26.474 position:50% align:center
They're probably
underground hiding

00:04:26.558 --> 00:04:28.435 position:50% align:center
or getting ready to flee.

00:04:28.518 --> 00:04:30.562 position:50% align:center
How's that supposed
to be loyalty?

00:04:30.645 --> 00:04:32.105 position:50% align:center
Forcing their henchmen
to fight for them

00:04:32.188 --> 00:04:34.691 position:50% align:center
while they run away
isn't manly at all!

00:04:45.744 --> 00:04:47.787 position:50% align:center
[SIR NIGHTEYE]
This is it.

00:04:47.871 --> 00:04:51.374 position:50% align:center
There's a device here that
opens a hidden passage.

00:04:51.458 --> 00:04:56.379 position:50% align:center
You press down the floorboards
in a specific order, and then...

00:04:56.463 --> 00:04:58.882 position:50% align:center
[BUBBLE GIRL] It's like
a ninja hideout! How cool!

00:04:58.965 --> 00:05:00.925 position:50% align:center
[CENTIPEDER] Thank goodness
for your Quirk, Sir.

00:05:01.009 --> 00:05:04.179 position:50% align:center
Guards up. We don't know what
we might be facing in there.

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:08.475 position:50% align:center
[HASSAIKAI MEMBER 71C]
Let's get the bastards!

00:05:08.558 --> 00:05:10.852 position:50% align:center
[CENTIPEDER] Bubble Girl!
You handle the third!

00:05:12.937 --> 00:05:14.356 position:50% align:center
[HASSAIKAI MEMBER 71D]
Damn it!

00:05:17.442 --> 00:05:19.110 position:50% align:center
Ah! My eyes!

00:05:19.194 --> 00:05:20.403 position:50% align:center
[BUBBLE GIRL]
Sorry.

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:23.782 position:50% align:center
[BUBBLE GIRL] We'll make sure
these guys don't follow.

00:05:23.865 --> 00:05:25.116 position:50% align:center
You go on ahead.

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:26.326 position:50% align:center
You heard her!

00:05:26.409 --> 00:05:28.036 position:50% align:center
[BUBBLE GIRL]
We'll catch up when we can!

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:32.540 position:50% align:center
[SIR NIGHTEYE]
We're almost there. Hurry!

00:05:35.001 --> 00:05:38.171 position:50% align:center
It looks like a dead
end. So, what now?

00:05:38.254 --> 00:05:40.006 position:50% align:center
So much for your
Foresight, Nighteye!

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:41.549 position:50% align:center
Hold on, let me go take a look.

00:05:41.633 --> 00:05:44.511 position:50% align:center
Lemillion, if you go
through, you'll be naked.

00:05:44.594 --> 00:05:47.263 position:50% align:center
It's okay. Mirio's costume
was constructed

00:05:47.347 --> 00:05:49.849 position:50% align:center
from a special fiber
made of his own hair.

00:05:49.933 --> 00:05:51.726 position:50% align:center
It's designed so it
becomes permeable

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:54.354 position:50% align:center
when he activates his Quirk.

00:05:54.437 --> 00:05:57.273 position:50% align:center
[MIRIO]
I knew it! The path continues,

00:05:57.357 --> 00:05:59.984 position:50% align:center
just like Nighteye
said it would.

00:06:00.068 --> 00:06:02.028 position:50% align:center
The hallway's just been
blocked with this wall.

00:06:02.112 --> 00:06:04.197 position:50% align:center
Unfortunately, breaking through
it's not gonna be easy.

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:06.408 position:50% align:center
I knew this Chisaki guy
could tear crap apart

00:06:06.491 --> 00:06:08.076 position:50% align:center
and put it back
together, but damn.

00:06:08.159 --> 00:06:09.703 position:50% align:center
It was just a cheap trick.

00:06:09.786 --> 00:06:12.330 position:50% align:center
If he did this, it's gotta mean
that we're on the right track!

00:06:12.414 --> 00:06:13.832 position:50% align:center
Yeah, you're right.

00:06:13.915 --> 00:06:16.042 position:50% align:center
But he's an idiot if he thinks
a dumb wall will stop us!

00:06:16.126 --> 00:06:19.170 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
One For All, Full Cowling.

00:06:20.296 --> 00:06:22.549 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Shoot style!

00:06:22.632 --> 00:06:25.093 position:50% align:center
[KIRISHIMA]
Red Gauntlet!

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:28.888 position:50% align:center
Hey, that didn't suck.

00:06:28.972 --> 00:06:31.766 position:50% align:center
I'll say! They beat
me to the punch.

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:33.560 position:50% align:center
We need to keep moving.

00:06:36.479 --> 00:06:39.983 position:50% align:center
[MIMIC grunts]

00:06:51.202 --> 00:06:52.537 position:50% align:center
The walls.

00:06:53.705 --> 00:06:55.123 position:50% align:center
[KIRISHIMA]
What's going on?

00:06:55.206 --> 00:06:57.000 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Everything's twisting!

00:06:58.043 --> 00:06:59.961 position:50% align:center
[DETECTIVE 70A yelps]
This is someone different.

00:07:00.045 --> 00:07:04.007 position:50% align:center
Maybe Iranaka. Chisaki's Quirk
can't do something like this.

00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:06.676 position:50% align:center
Iranaka's Quirk, Mimicry,
lets him enter

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:10.513 position:50% align:center
objects and control them
as he would his own body.

00:07:10.597 --> 00:07:12.057 position:50% align:center
He must have gone
into the concrete

00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:15.185 position:50% align:center
in the halls down here and
made this a living maze.

00:07:15.268 --> 00:07:17.354 position:50% align:center
It shouldn't be
possible on this scale!

00:07:17.437 --> 00:07:18.980 position:50% align:center
He's not supposed
to be able to control

00:07:19.064 --> 00:07:20.732 position:50% align:center
anything larger than
a damn refrigerator.

00:07:20.815 --> 00:07:22.359 position:50% align:center
Remember who we're
dealing with, here.

00:07:22.442 --> 00:07:25.403 position:50% align:center
Dollars to doughnuts, he's
using a performance-enhancer.

00:07:25.487 --> 00:07:26.988 position:50% align:center
I was ready for
just about anything,

00:07:27.072 --> 00:07:30.367 position:50% align:center
but I didn't expect the whole
building to turn against us.

00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:32.035 position:50% align:center
Still, controlling
something this big's

00:07:32.118 --> 00:07:35.622 position:50% align:center
gotta be wearin' the guy out.
Eraser Head! Can't you stop him?

00:07:35.705 --> 00:07:38.416 position:50% align:center
I can't do anything without
seeing his real body.

00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:42.212 position:50% align:center
With the passageway shifting
and changing like this,

00:07:42.295 --> 00:07:46.424 position:50% align:center
they can create as many escape
routes as they need to.

00:07:46.508 --> 00:07:47.676 position:50% align:center
We have to think quickly

00:07:47.759 --> 00:07:51.513 position:50% align:center
if we wanna catch them.
No, who are we kidding?

00:07:51.596 --> 00:07:53.014 position:50% align:center
They're gonna escape
with the girl,

00:07:53.098 --> 00:07:55.225 position:50% align:center
and we're all gonna
die down here!

00:07:55.308 --> 00:07:57.519 position:50% align:center
--[MIRIO] Tamaki!
--[AMAJIKI gasps]

00:07:57.602 --> 00:07:59.229 position:50% align:center
No way's that gonna happen.

00:07:59.312 --> 00:08:02.565 position:50% align:center
Understand? You can
do this, Suneater!

00:08:02.649 --> 00:08:05.485 position:50% align:center
Besides, this is just a stopgap!

00:08:05.568 --> 00:08:07.529 position:50% align:center
They can warp the path
forward if they want,

00:08:07.612 --> 00:08:10.156 position:50% align:center
but as long as we know
the direction of our goal,

00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:11.574 position:50% align:center
I can still reach it!

00:08:11.658 --> 00:08:12.450 position:50% align:center
Lemillion!

00:08:12.534 --> 00:08:13.785 position:50% align:center
Come back!

00:08:13.868 --> 00:08:15.662 position:50% align:center
[MIRIO] Speed is what
matters right now.

00:08:15.745 --> 00:08:16.913 position:50% align:center
Those guys know it, too,

00:08:16.996 --> 00:08:18.540 position:50% align:center
that's why they're
stalling for time.

00:08:18.623 --> 00:08:20.166 position:50% align:center
I'm going on ahead!

00:08:22.627 --> 00:08:25.255 position:50% align:center
[AMAJIKI] Why am I just
standing here like an idiot?

00:08:25.338 --> 00:08:27.590 position:50% align:center
Mirio's doing everything he can.

00:08:30.552 --> 00:08:34.723 position:50% align:center
[AMAJIKI] Come on! Give it
your all! You have to!

00:08:34.806 --> 00:08:38.643 position:50% align:center
[MIMIC] Slipping through
the walls, huh? Oh, well.

00:08:38.727 --> 00:08:40.353 position:50% align:center
Even if he does reach them,

00:08:40.437 --> 00:08:43.398 position:50% align:center
what'll he be able
to do by himself?

00:08:44.399 --> 00:08:46.818 position:50% align:center
[ALL scream]

00:08:51.197 --> 00:08:52.991 position:50% align:center
Now where are we?

00:08:53.074 --> 00:08:55.452 position:50% align:center
[LOCKLOCK] Somewhere even
farther from the target!

00:08:55.535 --> 00:08:57.203 position:50% align:center
Those guys're really
screwin' with us.

00:08:57.287 --> 00:08:59.372 position:50% align:center
[SETSUNO]
Well, what have we here?

00:08:59.456 --> 00:09:02.959 position:50% align:center
Looks like some state-authorized
thugs crashed our party!

00:09:03.043 --> 00:09:05.962 position:50% align:center
Isn't that strange?

00:09:06.046 --> 00:09:09.716 position:50% align:center
[FATGUM] These guys are
obviously ready for a fight.

00:09:09.799 --> 00:09:11.259 position:50% align:center
Let's see how long
petty criminals

00:09:11.343 --> 00:09:13.345 position:50% align:center
can last against the
strength of a pro--

00:09:14.429 --> 00:09:15.764 position:50% align:center
[AMAJIKI] The pros should
save their strength

Honestly, Tamaki.

The only reason I'm
able to do my best

00:09:22.354 --> 00:09:24.356 position:50% align:center
is because I have you
here inspiring me.

00:09:24.439 --> 00:09:25.690 position:50% align:center

people than I expected.

officers, first.

00:09:51.966 --> 00:09:53.510 position:50% align:center

00:09:53.593 --> 00:09:57.097 position:50% align:center

stay. I'll kill you all.

Setsuno! We can't
use our guns on him.

00:10:10.694 --> 00:10:11.695 position:50% align:center

You've done your homework.

00:10:13.363 --> 00:10:17.283 position:50% align:center
Oh, well. That just means
I'm free to let loose.

00:10:17.367 --> 00:10:20.370 position:50% align:center

Lay down your sword.

an inferior version of Eri.

00:10:27.711 --> 00:10:31.047 position:50% align:center
I'd heard that a hero with
your abilities existed.

00:10:31.131 --> 00:10:33.258 position:50% align:center
But our job's to slow you down.

00:10:33.341 --> 00:10:36.803 position:50% align:center
Quirks or no. We still
have fists and weapons.

00:10:36.886 --> 00:10:38.763 position:50% align:center
Fight all ya want,
but swords and bullets

00:10:38.847 --> 00:10:40.140 position:50% align:center
just sink into my body!

00:10:40.223 --> 00:10:43.018 position:50% align:center
You have no hope of beating us,
so why even bother?

00:10:43.101 --> 00:10:46.479 position:50% align:center
[SETSUNO] Big talk, but you
just sound scared to me, Hero.

00:10:46.563 --> 00:10:49.315 position:50% align:center
Eraser canceled their Quirks.
We can use our firearms.

00:10:49.399 --> 00:10:51.401 position:50% align:center

00:10:59.701 --> 00:11:02.203 position:50% align:center
I read all about these

00:11:04.039 --> 00:11:05.707 position:50% align:center
[AMAJIKI]
I can take these three on.

00:11:05.790 --> 00:11:07.917 position:50% align:center
We eat tons of Takoyaki
at the Fat Agency,

00:11:08.001 --> 00:11:10.211 position:50% align:center
so Octopus has become
one of my specialties.

00:11:10.295 --> 00:11:11.963 position:50% align:center
And you know, I gotta
say I'm pretty down

00:11:12.047 --> 00:11:14.007 position:50% align:center
on guns since I was
shot in the street.

00:11:14.090 --> 00:11:16.009 position:50% align:center
Hold on, Suneater!

00:11:16.092 --> 00:11:18.678 position:50% align:center
[AMAJIKI] It's not smart for
all of us to fight them.

00:11:18.762 --> 00:11:22.557 position:50% align:center
They want as many heroes
stalled here as possible.

00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:25.560 position:50% align:center
Let's just give them one.

00:11:25.643 --> 00:11:26.895 position:50% align:center
We should save all your Quirks,

00:11:26.978 --> 00:11:29.689 position:50% align:center
especially Eraser
Head's, for later!

00:11:29.773 --> 00:11:31.649 position:50% align:center
You'll need to be
operating at 100 percent

00:11:31.733 --> 00:11:34.527 position:50% align:center
to get through those

[SETSUNO]
Hey, wait, where're you going?

00:11:46.956 --> 00:11:48.375 position:50% align:center
Not again.

00:11:51.961 --> 00:11:54.047 position:50% align:center
Amajiki. You need to move fast.

00:11:54.130 --> 00:11:56.966 position:50% align:center
Beat them before
they can fight back.

00:11:57.050 --> 00:11:58.885 position:50% align:center

You have to take care of Mirio!

00:12:03.973 --> 00:12:06.685 position:50% align:center
He's definitely going
to try too hard.

00:12:06.768 --> 00:12:08.853 position:50% align:center
So please keep him safe.

00:12:10.397 --> 00:12:11.439 position:50% align:center
Fatgum!

00:12:11.523 --> 00:12:12.982 position:50% align:center
You gonna leave him
alone back there?

00:12:13.066 --> 00:12:14.401 position:50% align:center
What are you thinking?

00:12:14.484 --> 00:12:16.403 position:50% align:center
He's from your agency,
so I left the decision to you.

00:12:16.486 --> 00:12:18.154 position:50% align:center
But are you sure
he can handle them?

00:12:18.238 --> 00:12:21.116 position:50% align:center
Seems kinda risky.

00:12:21.199 --> 00:12:22.742 position:50% align:center
I have faith in him.

00:12:22.826 --> 00:12:25.036 position:50% align:center
He's stronger than anybody here.

00:12:26.621 --> 00:12:30.417 position:50% align:center
His only weakness
is self-confidence.

00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:31.793 position:50% align:center
The pressure to do
things perfectly

00:12:31.876 --> 00:12:34.004 position:50% align:center
sometimes leaves him
feeling crushed.

00:12:34.087 --> 00:12:35.422 position:50% align:center
Breaking his spirit.

00:12:35.505 --> 00:12:38.299 position:50% align:center
And yet, he's risen to become
one of UA's Big Three

00:12:38.383 --> 00:12:40.176 position:50% align:center
under those conditions.

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:42.262 position:50% align:center
So I trust him when he
says he can take down

00:12:42.345 --> 00:12:45.890 position:50% align:center
those thugs on his own.
If he believes in himself,

00:12:45.974 --> 00:12:47.726 position:50% align:center
I believe in him.

00:12:49.936 --> 00:12:51.062 position:50% align:center
[AMAJIKI]
These guys are here to keep us

00:12:51.146 --> 00:12:53.523 position:50% align:center
from heading to the target.

00:12:53.606 --> 00:12:55.942 position:50% align:center
It's strange that Irinaka
isn't using his mimicry

00:12:56.026 --> 00:12:57.569 position:50% align:center
to help them out, though.

00:12:57.652 --> 00:13:01.406 position:50% align:center
Did he prioritize the police
officers left up top?

00:13:01.489 --> 00:13:05.994 position:50% align:center
Whatever the case,
these criminals are mine.

when it comes to us.

00:13:34.606 --> 00:13:35.982 position:50% align:center
[SETSUNO] When you're
fighting people who're

00:13:36.066 --> 00:13:37.942 position:50% align:center
basically human garbage,

00:13:38.026 --> 00:13:41.988 position:50% align:center

as something he can take.

[SETSUNO] See we've given up
everything, even our lives!

00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:08.640 position:50% align:center
I was so hopeless once
I even tried to jump

00:14:43.425 --> 00:14:45.468 position:50% align:center
more impressive things by now.

00:16:19.229 --> 00:16:20.480 position:50% align:center
[AMAJIKI]
What?

00:16:20.563 --> 00:16:22.190 position:50% align:center
[MIRIO] You think I'm
better than I am and think

00:16:22.273 --> 00:16:23.983 position:50% align:center
you're not as hype as you are.

00:16:24.067 --> 00:16:26.194 position:50% align:center
That's why you call me
things like "the sun."

00:16:26.277 --> 00:16:28.738 position:50% align:center
Like, come on,
I'm not that great.

00:16:28.822 --> 00:16:30.949 position:50% align:center
You have an amazing power, dude.

00:16:31.032 --> 00:16:35.078 position:50% align:center
And it's just going to get
better, I'm sure of it.

00:16:35.161 --> 00:16:36.746 position:50% align:center
And you know what else I think?

00:16:36.830 --> 00:16:42.335 position:50% align:center
Deep down, you're a smiley,
fun, super-cheerful guy.

00:16:43.461 --> 00:16:44.963 position:50% align:center
[HOJO grunts]

00:16:45.046 --> 00:16:46.881 position:50% align:center
[MIRIO] So if I'm the sun,
you must be something

00:16:46.965 --> 00:16:48.466 position:50% align:center
even more amazing than that.

00:16:48.550 --> 00:16:52.220 position:50% align:center
Let's see. Ooh! I know.

00:16:52.303 --> 00:16:53.596 position:50% align:center
[AMAJIKI]
That's who I am.

00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:57.684 position:50% align:center
Have confidence in yourself,
Tamaki. Cuz, you're...

00:16:57.767 --> 00:17:00.562 position:50% align:center
[AMAJIKI] Yes. I've got
a light that can swallow

00:17:00.645 --> 00:17:03.940 position:50% align:center
even the Sun's.
That's why I'm Suneater!

00:17:04.024 --> 00:17:06.067 position:50% align:center
[HOJO gasps]

00:17:06.151 --> 00:17:08.653 position:50% align:center
[HOJO] He's using octopus
arms full of thick muscles

00:17:08.737 --> 00:17:11.489 position:50% align:center
to absorb the shock,
and protecting himself

00:17:11.573 --> 00:17:15.243 position:50% align:center
from any crystal damage using
a thick plating of shells.

00:17:15.326 --> 00:17:17.829 position:50% align:center
[HOJO]
But that won't stop me!

00:17:17.912 --> 00:17:19.414 position:50% align:center
[AMAJIKI]
This is it.

00:17:20.999 --> 00:17:22.542 position:50% align:center
[AMAJIKI]
Over the last two years at UA,

00:17:22.625 --> 00:17:26.296 position:50% align:center
I've trained hard
to master my Quirk.

00:17:26.379 --> 00:17:30.175 position:50% align:center
Now it's time to use
it to its fullest.

00:17:30.258 --> 00:17:32.802 position:50% align:center
Expressing several
manifestations at once.

00:17:32.886 --> 00:17:34.429 position:50% align:center
Increasing their sizes.

00:17:34.512 --> 00:17:36.848 position:50% align:center
Picking and choosing
characteristics.

00:17:39.142 --> 00:17:40.310 position:50% align:center
[HOJO gasps]

00:17:42.354 --> 00:17:44.272 position:50% align:center
[AMAJIKI]
Vast Hybrid.

00:17:47.150 --> 00:17:50.320 position:50% align:center
[AMAJIKI]
Chimera Kraken!

00:17:52.906 --> 00:17:55.950 position:50% align:center
[SETSUNO]
Hey, hey, hey, hey hey!

00:17:56.034 --> 00:17:58.411 position:50% align:center
[AMAJIKI]
I'm enough on my own.

00:17:58.495 --> 00:17:59.871 position:50% align:center
[SETSUNO]
This isn't looking good.

00:17:59.954 --> 00:18:03.124 position:50% align:center
Tabe, wake up! Time to eat!

00:18:07.629 --> 00:18:08.838 position:50% align:center
[AMAJIKI gasps]

00:18:08.922 --> 00:18:12.258 position:50% align:center
Yum. Seafood.

00:18:12.342 --> 00:18:15.345 position:50% align:center
[SETSUNO laughs]
With those teeth and jaws,

00:18:15.428 --> 00:18:17.681 position:50% align:center
he can devour anything
in an instant!

00:18:17.764 --> 00:18:20.183 position:50% align:center
And, he digests whatever
he eats in seconds!

00:18:20.266 --> 00:18:21.309 position:50% align:center
It's ridiculous.

00:18:21.393 --> 00:18:23.103 position:50% align:center
Tabe's stomach will
never get full.

00:18:23.186 --> 00:18:26.856 position:50% align:center
I'd actually say you two
are a match made in heaven!

00:18:26.940 --> 00:18:28.441 position:50% align:center
[AMAJIKI]
Of course.

00:18:28.525 --> 00:18:30.568 position:50% align:center
Eraser must have realized this,

00:18:30.652 --> 00:18:33.321 position:50% align:center
that's why he took him
out before he left.

00:18:33.405 --> 00:18:34.489 position:50% align:center
But it's fine.

00:18:34.572 --> 00:18:36.866 position:50% align:center
I've got plenty
of space to move.

00:18:36.950 --> 00:18:39.077 position:50% align:center
I can dodge his attacks!

00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:40.495 position:50% align:center
Yum!

00:18:43.581 --> 00:18:45.208 position:50% align:center
[HOJO]
I thought I had him.

00:18:45.291 --> 00:18:48.086 position:50% align:center
His reaction time's good.

00:18:48.169 --> 00:18:52.340 position:50% align:center
But, that's not enough
to stop my crystallization!

00:18:53.883 --> 00:18:55.135 position:50% align:center
[SETSUNO] You're the one
that wanted to fight

00:18:55.218 --> 00:18:58.013 position:50% align:center
three-on-one, right, Suneater?

00:18:58.096 --> 00:18:59.681 position:50% align:center
Did you think that you'd
get the best of us

00:18:59.764 --> 00:19:03.727 position:50% align:center
by waving around a couple
of oversized appetizers?

00:19:05.687 --> 00:19:07.188 position:50% align:center
[AMAJIKI]
I'll manifest the neurotoxin

00:19:07.272 --> 00:19:09.607 position:50% align:center
from an octopus's
saliva in my arm!

00:19:09.691 --> 00:19:12.736 position:50% align:center
If he eats it. He won't
be able to move anymore!

00:19:15.321 --> 00:19:17.615 position:50% align:center
[SETSUNO] Those tentacles
were too big to steal before.

00:19:17.699 --> 00:19:20.326 position:50% align:center
But small ones are no problem.

00:19:23.204 --> 00:19:25.999 position:50% align:center
[AMAJIKI]
Their teamwork is incredible.

00:19:26.082 --> 00:19:28.251 position:50% align:center
[HOJO]
We may be a bunch of trash.

00:19:28.335 --> 00:19:31.421 position:50% align:center
But that doesn't mean we
don't have strong bonds.

00:19:31.504 --> 00:19:35.592 position:50% align:center
Yeah, but, bonds or no,
you'll still be arrested soon.

00:19:35.675 --> 00:19:37.802 position:50% align:center
Your futures are lost,
no matter what.

00:19:37.886 --> 00:19:40.972 position:50% align:center
[SETSUNO]
Heh, heh. Like that matters.

00:19:41.056 --> 00:19:44.059 position:50% align:center
[HOJO] We haven't had
a future for some time.

00:19:44.142 --> 00:19:48.271 position:50% align:center
One of us didn't fit into
society and was tossed aside.

00:19:48.355 --> 00:19:50.357 position:50% align:center
One was betrayed by his lover

00:19:50.440 --> 00:19:52.817 position:50% align:center
and buried beneath
a mountain of debt.

00:19:52.901 --> 00:19:54.402 position:50% align:center
[SETSUNO]
Pouches full of food.

00:19:54.486 --> 00:19:57.322 position:50% align:center
I guess you can turn the
things you eat into power?

00:19:57.405 --> 00:19:59.949 position:50% align:center
[HOJO] One was used as
a tool by someone obsessed

00:20:00.033 --> 00:20:02.869 position:50% align:center
with money, but when it
was discovered that the gems

00:20:02.952 --> 00:20:04.746 position:50% align:center
he produced were
worthless fakes,

00:20:04.829 --> 00:20:09.000 position:50% align:center
he was beaten within an inch
of his life and left for dead.

00:20:09.084 --> 00:20:11.961 position:50% align:center
That's why <i>he</i>
means so much to us.

00:20:12.045 --> 00:20:14.172 position:50% align:center
[CHISAKI]
Come. Join me.

00:20:14.255 --> 00:20:19.386 position:50% align:center
Someone like you shouldn't
be left to rot in the gutter.

00:20:19.469 --> 00:20:22.472 position:50% align:center
[HOJO] Who cares what
happens after this?

00:20:22.555 --> 00:20:25.850 position:50% align:center
He picked us up and
gave us worth again.

00:20:25.934 --> 00:20:28.812 position:50% align:center
I'll kill anyone
who gets in his way.

00:20:28.895 --> 00:20:30.855 position:50% align:center
[AMAJIKI] They don't
follow him out of fear.

00:20:30.939 --> 00:20:33.358 position:50% align:center
It's more like
they're brainwashed.

00:20:33.441 --> 00:20:36.027 position:50% align:center
You really just wanna be
used up and thrown away?

00:20:36.111 --> 00:20:37.696 position:50% align:center
[HOJO] Even with your
back against the wall

00:20:37.779 --> 00:20:41.032 position:50% align:center
you can't understand,
can you hero?

00:20:42.367 --> 00:20:44.411 position:50% align:center
[AMAJIKI]
My tentacles were eaten.

00:20:44.494 --> 00:20:47.163 position:50% align:center
My defenses stolen.

00:20:47.247 --> 00:20:49.416 position:50% align:center
[HOJO]
We may be a bunch of trash.

00:20:49.499 --> 00:20:53.253 position:50% align:center
But that doesn't mean we
don't have strong bonds.

00:20:53.336 --> 00:20:54.379 position:50% align:center
[AMAJIKI]
Fine!

00:20:54.462 --> 00:20:55.922 position:50% align:center
[SETSUNO]
Ow!

00:20:56.006 --> 00:20:58.717 position:50% align:center
[AMAJIKI]
I'll go after their teamwork.

00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:01.177 position:50% align:center
Larceny only works
on things he can see.

00:21:01.261 --> 00:21:04.389 position:50% align:center
That's why the police
couldn't brandish their guns.

00:21:04.472 --> 00:21:06.182 position:50% align:center
[HOJO]
Die!

00:21:09.644 --> 00:21:14.274 position:50% align:center
[HOJO] Hold on.
Don't tell me. Did he...

00:21:14.357 --> 00:21:15.859 position:50% align:center
...eat my crystals?

00:21:15.942 --> 00:21:17.277 position:50% align:center
When you weren't looking!

00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:18.862 position:50% align:center
[HOJO groans]

00:21:20.030 --> 00:21:23.324 position:50% align:center
Eat! Eat! Eat! Eat! Eat! Eat!

00:21:29.914 --> 00:21:34.627 position:50% align:center
[AMAJIKI] You trust each other.
You watch each other's backs.

00:21:34.711 --> 00:21:38.089 position:50% align:center
I can't understand your
circumstances or anger,

00:21:38.173 --> 00:21:40.425 position:50% align:center
or sadness for that matter.

00:21:40.508 --> 00:21:44.179 position:50% align:center
But... I do understand
your strong bonds.

00:21:46.514 --> 00:21:48.475 position:50% align:center
[AMAJIKI]
You're more than teammates.

00:21:50.268 --> 00:21:51.686 position:50% align:center
[AMAJIKI]
I get that.

00:21:54.189 --> 00:21:56.649 position:50% align:center
And friends don't
eat friends, do they?

00:23:29.409 --> 00:23:30.827 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Here's the preview.

00:23:30.910 --> 00:23:33.955 position:50% align:center
Kirishima and Fatgum get
separated from the raid group.

00:23:34.039 --> 00:23:36.291 position:50% align:center
In a flash, they're attacked
by Rappa and Tengai,

00:23:36.374 --> 00:23:38.043 position:50% align:center
Chisaki's henchmen.

00:23:38.126 --> 00:23:40.378 position:50% align:center
The yakuza members have
overwhelming offensive

00:23:40.462 --> 00:23:44.174 position:50% align:center
and defensive powers, and
Kirishima's spirit falters.

00:23:44.257 --> 00:23:46.760 position:50% align:center
But, I believe in my classmate.

00:23:46.843 --> 00:23:49.262 position:50% align:center
I know he has the strength
to beat these opponents,

00:23:49.346 --> 00:23:50.930 position:50% align:center
and to become a hero!

00:23:51.014 --> 00:23:53.099 position:50% align:center
Next time: "Red Riot."

00:23:53.183 --> 00:23:54.934 position:50% align:center
Kirishima will not break!

00:23:55.018 --> 00:23:57.812 position:50% align:center
Go beyond! Plus Ultra!
