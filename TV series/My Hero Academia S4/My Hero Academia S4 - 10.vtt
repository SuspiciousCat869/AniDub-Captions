00:00:09.551 --> 00:00:10.343 position:50% align:center
[RAPPA]
We've got a long way to go,

00:00:10.427 --> 00:00:12.345 position:50% align:center
and I'm just gettin' warmed up!

00:00:16.182 --> 00:00:18.059 position:50% align:center
All right, kid! Let's go!

00:00:18.143 --> 00:00:21.021 position:50% align:center
[yells]

00:00:22.731 --> 00:00:24.649 position:50% align:center
[TENGAI]
The boy's attack was in vain.

00:00:24.733 --> 00:00:26.317 position:50% align:center
[FATGUM]
It wasn't in vain!

00:00:26.401 --> 00:00:28.653 position:50% align:center
Thank you, Red!

00:00:28.737 --> 00:00:30.321 position:50% align:center
You bought me the time I needed!

00:00:30.405 --> 00:00:31.573 position:50% align:center
A shield, now?

00:00:31.656 --> 00:00:33.199 position:50% align:center
The two of you are gonna lose.

00:00:33.283 --> 00:00:34.576 position:50% align:center
Do you wanna know why?

00:00:34.659 --> 00:00:37.078 position:50% align:center
You made a mistake.
And so did I.

00:00:37.162 --> 00:00:39.998 position:50% align:center
We underestimated the
hero named Red Riot

00:00:40.081 --> 00:00:43.501 position:50% align:center
and his chivalrous spirit!

00:00:50.592 --> 00:00:55.555 position:50% align:center
A spear and a shield.
The victory is ours.

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:26.980 position:50% align:center
[rumbling]

00:02:27.063 --> 00:02:28.898 position:50% align:center
[CHISAKI]
So much noise.

00:02:28.982 --> 00:02:31.860 position:50% align:center
Those fools had better
be doing their jobs.

00:02:31.943 --> 00:02:33.069 position:50% align:center
[KURONO]
I hate to say it,

00:02:33.153 --> 00:02:35.572 position:50% align:center
but I think this is the
end for the Hassaikai.

00:02:35.655 --> 00:02:37.574 position:50% align:center
[CHISAKI]
As long as the boss and I live,

00:02:37.657 --> 00:02:39.993 position:50% align:center
the Hassaikai will, too.

00:02:40.076 --> 00:02:42.287 position:50% align:center
Most of the men
remain loyal to him

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:45.081 position:50% align:center
but don't understand
my way of thinking.

00:02:45.165 --> 00:02:47.167 position:50% align:center
Even though I respect
the boss's will

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:50.211 position:50% align:center
more than any of them do.

00:02:50.295 --> 00:02:52.255 position:50% align:center
As long as we have
the finished product

00:02:52.339 --> 00:02:54.466 position:50% align:center
and the serum,
I can bring us back

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:56.593 position:50% align:center
from the brink of extinction.

00:02:56.676 --> 00:02:58.845 position:50% align:center
This little incident
will make a good story

00:02:58.928 --> 00:03:01.097 position:50% align:center
for potential investors.

00:03:01.181 --> 00:03:03.975 position:50% align:center
We've developed a drug
that heroes are afraid of.

00:03:04.059 --> 00:03:06.311 position:50% align:center
Exactly the sort of
thing they're after.

00:03:06.394 --> 00:03:08.772 position:50% align:center
They'll finance it happily.

00:03:08.855 --> 00:03:10.815 position:50% align:center
And on that note...

00:03:10.899 --> 00:03:14.819 position:50% align:center
It's time to pull
your weight, temps.

00:03:14.903 --> 00:03:16.488 position:50% align:center
'Kay.

00:03:16.571 --> 00:03:18.948 position:50% align:center
[TWICE] You can leave
it to us, Overhaul.

00:03:23.703 --> 00:03:29.042 position:50% align:center
[FATGUM] Red! Red Riot!
Can you hear me? Wake up!

00:03:29.125 --> 00:03:30.585 position:50% align:center
Who...

00:03:30.669 --> 00:03:32.045 position:50% align:center
...are you?

00:03:32.128 --> 00:03:33.338 position:50% align:center
It's me, Fatgum!

00:03:33.421 --> 00:03:34.964 position:50% align:center
I had to shed a few
pounds to end that fight,

00:03:35.048 --> 00:03:36.633 position:50% align:center
but come on!

00:03:36.716 --> 00:03:40.553 position:50% align:center
[KIRISHIMA]
Fat. I'll... protect you.

00:03:40.637 --> 00:03:46.685 position:50% align:center
I'll stay strong. I promise.
Whatever it takes.

00:03:46.768 --> 00:03:48.728 position:50% align:center
[FATGUM]
Kirishima.

00:03:48.812 --> 00:03:50.105 position:50% align:center
[FATGUM]
Tamaki brought a friend?

00:03:50.188 --> 00:03:51.940 position:50% align:center
Didn't see that comin'!

00:03:52.941 --> 00:03:54.776 position:50% align:center
I've seen you fight before.

00:03:54.859 --> 00:03:57.570 position:50% align:center
At the sports festival.
You had real spunk!

00:03:57.654 --> 00:03:59.239 position:50% align:center
Tamaki never does
well there because

00:03:59.322 --> 00:04:01.616 position:50% align:center
he ends up lost in his own head.

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:05.578 position:50% align:center
Thanks. I did my internship
with Fourth Kind,

00:04:05.662 --> 00:04:07.664 position:50% align:center
and he seemed to like
my attitude, too.

00:04:07.747 --> 00:04:09.708 position:50% align:center
He said energetic
employees were good

00:04:09.791 --> 00:04:14.170 position:50% align:center
for an agency's morale. But...

00:04:14.254 --> 00:04:16.131 position:50% align:center
That's all I am.

00:04:16.214 --> 00:04:19.259 position:50% align:center
And I wanna be more than that.

00:04:19.342 --> 00:04:21.177 position:50% align:center
I wanna be a hero
who protects people

00:04:21.261 --> 00:04:23.430 position:50% align:center
with the strength of his spirit.

00:04:23.513 --> 00:04:26.391 position:50% align:center
Like Crimson Riot.

00:04:26.474 --> 00:04:27.726 position:50% align:center
That's why I bugged Tamaki

00:04:27.809 --> 00:04:30.687 position:50% align:center
till he agreed to
introduce me to you.

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:32.230 position:50% align:center
I once failed people in trouble

00:04:32.313 --> 00:04:35.483 position:50% align:center
because I was scared.
But never again.

00:04:37.152 --> 00:04:41.865 position:50% align:center
I'll be like him. Like Crimson.

00:04:41.948 --> 00:04:45.827 position:50% align:center
[FATGUM] You've done enough.
More than enough.

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:47.954 position:50% align:center
[RAPPA]
It's not over.

00:04:48.038 --> 00:04:52.667 position:50% align:center
This is a battle to the death,
and I'm not dead yet!

00:04:52.751 --> 00:04:55.128 position:50% align:center
[FATGUM]
He's back on his feet already?

00:04:55.211 --> 00:04:58.882 position:50% align:center
That barrier must've
cushioned the blow somehow.

00:04:58.965 --> 00:05:00.884 position:50% align:center
I don't have any fat left.

00:05:00.967 --> 00:05:03.178 position:50% align:center
And I used all
that stored power.

00:05:03.261 --> 00:05:04.929 position:50% align:center
What should I do?

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:07.807 position:50% align:center
[RAPPA] There's a back
room where we can go

00:05:07.891 --> 00:05:09.684 position:50% align:center
and get ourselves patched up.

00:05:09.768 --> 00:05:13.563 position:50% align:center
Bring that ki--bring
that man with you.

00:05:16.775 --> 00:05:18.026 position:50% align:center
Nice try.

00:05:18.109 --> 00:05:20.070 position:50% align:center
[RAPPA] I seem like
a guy who sets traps?

00:05:20.153 --> 00:05:22.906 position:50% align:center
[TENGAI]
Rappa! Stop! Listen to me.

00:05:22.989 --> 00:05:26.159 position:50% align:center
It's my job to keep your
recklessness under control.

00:05:26.242 --> 00:05:27.410 position:50% align:center
Do as I say!

00:05:27.494 --> 00:05:28.787 position:50% align:center
[RAPPA]
Huh?

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:30.997 position:50% align:center
[TENGAI] Think about why
they'd want you down here.

00:05:31.081 --> 00:05:33.958 position:50% align:center
A bloodthirsty beast
who thrives on violence.

00:05:34.042 --> 00:05:35.794 position:50% align:center
You have a job to do,
and it's not--

00:05:35.877 --> 00:05:37.545 position:50% align:center
[RAPPA] You don't even
have enough strength left

00:05:37.629 --> 00:05:40.882 position:50% align:center
to put up a Barrier. So shut it.

00:05:40.965 --> 00:05:43.218 position:50% align:center
Honestly. With these
broken bones,

00:05:43.301 --> 00:05:46.596 position:50% align:center
I can't lift my arms,
so I'm wrecked, too.

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:48.765 position:50% align:center
What do you want from us, Rappa?

00:05:48.848 --> 00:05:51.309 position:50% align:center
[RAPPA]
I want a fight. To the death.

00:05:51.393 --> 00:05:53.853 position:50% align:center
I come from the world of MMA.

00:05:53.937 --> 00:05:55.522 position:50% align:center
You must've heard of it, right?

00:05:55.605 --> 00:05:59.818 position:50% align:center
A fight club where challengers
go all-out with their Quirks.

00:05:59.901 --> 00:06:01.778 position:50% align:center
Most of my opponents
went down after

00:06:01.861 --> 00:06:04.489 position:50% align:center
a single punch and
didn't get back up.

00:06:04.572 --> 00:06:07.784 position:50% align:center
The ones who did just started
beggin' for their lives.

00:06:07.867 --> 00:06:09.452 position:50% align:center
You know what that's like?

00:06:09.536 --> 00:06:11.538 position:50% align:center
Hoping for a
challenge and always

00:06:11.621 --> 00:06:14.124 position:50% align:center
walking away unsatisfied.

00:06:14.207 --> 00:06:17.127 position:50% align:center
You're never more powerful than
when your life is at stake.

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:20.380 position:50% align:center
That's why the best fight is
a deathmatch between equals.

00:06:20.463 --> 00:06:22.132 position:50% align:center
You guys were freakin' awesome!

00:06:22.215 --> 00:06:26.302 position:50% align:center
Especially the redhead!
I really like his style!

00:06:26.386 --> 00:06:27.971 position:50% align:center
So let's have another match!

00:06:28.054 --> 00:06:29.264 position:50% align:center
You better heal up.

00:06:29.347 --> 00:06:32.809 position:50% align:center
'Cause I'll kill you
for sure next time.

00:06:32.892 --> 00:06:34.185 position:50% align:center
Don't you get it?

00:06:34.269 --> 00:06:36.479 position:50% align:center
You're gonna be arrested
and put in jail for this.

00:06:36.563 --> 00:06:38.023 position:50% align:center
There is no next time.

00:06:38.106 --> 00:06:40.233 position:50% align:center
You and your friend
are done. It's over!

00:06:40.316 --> 00:06:43.653 position:50% align:center
[RAPPA] Who cares?
Nobody died, so it's a draw!

00:06:43.737 --> 00:06:44.904 position:50% align:center
[FATGUM]
That's not how it works!

00:06:44.988 --> 00:06:47.782 position:50% align:center
This isn't a fight in some ring.

00:06:47.866 --> 00:06:50.869 position:50% align:center
[FATGUM] It's crazy, but I
think he really means it.

00:06:50.952 --> 00:06:53.371 position:50% align:center
He's so straightforward
and single-minded,

00:06:53.455 --> 00:06:56.416 position:50% align:center
there's no way he has
an ulterior motive.

00:06:56.499 --> 00:06:59.252 position:50% align:center
Either way,
as beat-up as we are,

00:06:59.336 --> 00:07:02.255 position:50% align:center
it'll be hard to
catch up to Nighteye.

00:07:02.339 --> 00:07:04.341 position:50% align:center
I think I get it now, Red.

00:07:04.424 --> 00:07:07.177 position:50% align:center
You were down on yourself
and desperate to change.

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:09.679 position:50% align:center
Tamaki saw that and
brought you to me.

00:07:09.763 --> 00:07:12.766 position:50% align:center
Because he understood.

00:07:12.849 --> 00:07:16.102 position:50% align:center
He knows what it's like
to be frozen by self-doubt.

00:07:16.186 --> 00:07:18.021 position:50% align:center
[RAPPA]
I wanna face you both again.

00:07:18.104 --> 00:07:23.109 position:50% align:center
I called him a kid.
But I was wrong. He's a man.

00:07:23.193 --> 00:07:26.112 position:50% align:center
[FATGUM] We both got
banged up pretty good there.

00:07:26.196 --> 00:07:27.614 position:50% align:center
But we did it.

00:07:27.697 --> 00:07:29.240 position:50% align:center
And you've proven what
you're capable of,

00:07:29.324 --> 00:07:33.703 position:50% align:center
not only to me, but more
importantly, to the enemy.

00:07:35.747 --> 00:07:39.626 position:50% align:center
[MIMIC] The boy who went ahead.
Alone, he's not a threat.

00:07:39.709 --> 00:07:41.378 position:50% align:center
This is their main force.

00:07:41.461 --> 00:07:43.963 position:50% align:center
The ones I need to stop.

00:07:44.047 --> 00:07:46.257 position:50% align:center
My boost will wear off soon.

00:07:46.341 --> 00:07:49.719 position:50% align:center
No choice but to do it now.

00:07:49.803 --> 00:07:53.306 position:50% align:center
We've left the old ways behind,
and there's no going back.

00:07:53.390 --> 00:07:55.225 position:50% align:center
We can only move forward!

00:07:55.308 --> 00:07:56.226 position:50% align:center
Hurry!

00:07:56.309 --> 00:07:59.062 position:50% align:center
We need to catch up
to Mirio fast!

00:07:59.145 --> 00:08:01.022 position:50% align:center
No! Again?

00:08:01.106 --> 00:08:04.567 position:50% align:center
It's moving! The ceiling,
the walls. Everything!

00:08:04.651 --> 00:08:06.069 position:50% align:center
They're closing in, fast!

00:08:06.152 --> 00:08:07.195 position:50% align:center
[AIZAWA]
He's trying to crush us.

00:08:07.278 --> 00:08:09.447 position:50% align:center
We'll be flattened
like damn pancakes!

00:08:11.533 --> 00:08:13.284 position:50% align:center
[FATGUM] It's not much,
but these bandages

00:08:13.368 --> 00:08:15.245 position:50% align:center
should stop the
bleeding at least.

00:08:15.328 --> 00:08:18.498 position:50% align:center
I hate to delay, but I
shouldn't move him just yet.

00:08:18.581 --> 00:08:20.166 position:50% align:center
[RAPPA]
So, can I fight him now?

00:08:20.250 --> 00:08:23.086 position:50% align:center
He's still unconscious!

00:08:23.169 --> 00:08:25.422 position:50% align:center
Hey, this might be
a weird question

00:08:25.505 --> 00:08:27.632 position:50% align:center
for a hero to ask,
but since we're gettin'

00:08:27.716 --> 00:08:29.968 position:50% align:center
to know each other
or whatever...

00:08:30.051 --> 00:08:32.012 position:50% align:center
Wanna tell me what you're
doing running around

00:08:32.095 --> 00:08:34.764 position:50% align:center
with a smalltime gang like this?

00:08:34.848 --> 00:08:36.224 position:50% align:center
[RAPPA]
'Cause of Overhaul.

00:08:36.307 --> 00:08:40.353 position:50% align:center
He's the only person
I ever lost to.

00:08:40.437 --> 00:08:41.980 position:50% align:center
He beat you?

00:08:42.063 --> 00:08:45.108 position:50% align:center
[RAPPA] He came outta nowhere,
sayin' I should join his gang.

00:08:45.191 --> 00:08:46.943 position:50% align:center
Got real pushy about it, too.

00:08:47.027 --> 00:08:49.738 position:50% align:center
I told him he could
fight me for it.

00:08:53.283 --> 00:08:57.078 position:50% align:center
[RAPPA]
One second, I was dead.

00:08:57.162 --> 00:08:59.748 position:50% align:center
[RAPPA]
The next, I was back to normal.

00:08:59.831 --> 00:09:02.459 position:50% align:center
So I joined up, challenged
him five more times

00:09:02.542 --> 00:09:04.502 position:50% align:center
and lost every single match.

00:09:04.586 --> 00:09:05.879 position:50% align:center
That's why I'm here.

00:09:05.962 --> 00:09:08.256 position:50% align:center
'Cause I still haven't
beaten him yet.

00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:12.844 position:50% align:center
[FATGUM]
He lost? Five times? No way.

00:09:12.927 --> 00:09:15.096 position:50% align:center
As fast and powerful
as Rappa is,

00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:18.141 position:50% align:center
Chisaki can still take him?

00:09:18.224 --> 00:09:20.560 position:50% align:center
[FATGUM]
Your boss is obviously strong,

00:09:20.643 --> 00:09:22.937 position:50% align:center
but he left the fighting
to his underlings.

00:09:23.021 --> 00:09:26.399 position:50% align:center
Why not make a stand,
face us himself?

00:09:26.483 --> 00:09:29.277 position:50% align:center
His only other options
are running or hiding.

00:09:29.361 --> 00:09:31.321 position:50% align:center
What does he want?

00:09:31.404 --> 00:09:32.572 position:50% align:center
[TENGAI]
Nice try, hero.

00:09:32.655 --> 00:09:33.782 position:50% align:center
We're not going
to tell you anyth--

00:09:33.865 --> 00:09:35.533 position:50% align:center
[RAPPA] To make the
yakuza powerful again.

00:09:35.617 --> 00:09:36.576 position:50% align:center
[TENGAI]
Rappa!

00:09:36.659 --> 00:09:37.786 position:50% align:center
[RAPPA]
I don't know the details,

00:09:37.869 --> 00:09:39.120 position:50% align:center
but I've heard 'em talkin'.

00:09:39.204 --> 00:09:41.039 position:50% align:center
They're lookin' to
distribute somethin'.

00:09:41.122 --> 00:09:43.958 position:50% align:center
Not sure what, exactly, but
apparently there's a lot of it.

00:09:44.042 --> 00:09:45.210 position:50% align:center
[TENGAI]
That's enough!

00:09:45.293 --> 00:09:47.337 position:50% align:center
[RAPPA] They need money
to get the ball rollin',

00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:49.381 position:50% align:center
and once they've got the cash,

00:09:49.464 --> 00:09:53.134 position:50% align:center
the day it all goes down
won't be far behind.

00:09:54.594 --> 00:09:56.262 position:50% align:center
[KURONO]
The building's shaking.

00:09:56.346 --> 00:09:58.556 position:50% align:center
Irinaka's usually so careful.

00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:01.226 position:50% align:center
Sounds like he's
finally getting serious.

00:10:01.309 --> 00:10:02.435 position:50% align:center
[SIR NIGHTEYE]
Locklock, do something!

00:10:02.519 --> 00:10:05.021 position:50% align:center
Stop giving orders!
This is all your fault.

00:10:05.105 --> 00:10:08.066 position:50% align:center
Listenin' to you is what
got us into this mess!

00:10:08.149 --> 00:10:11.361 position:50% align:center
Fine! This oughta
do it! Deadbolt!

00:10:11.444 --> 00:10:12.904 position:50% align:center
Once I lock somethin' down,

00:10:12.987 --> 00:10:14.906 position:50% align:center
it ain't goin' anywhere.

00:10:14.989 --> 00:10:16.491 position:50% align:center
[PRESENT MIC]
Lock Hero: Locklock.

00:10:16.574 --> 00:10:18.034 position:50% align:center
His Quirk: Lockdown!

00:10:18.118 --> 00:10:20.120 position:50% align:center
He can make nonliving
things freeze in place

00:10:20.203 --> 00:10:21.371 position:50% align:center
with a touch of his hand.

00:10:21.454 --> 00:10:23.665 position:50% align:center
However, enough force
can overwhelm his power,

00:10:23.748 --> 00:10:26.042 position:50% align:center
and there's a limit to the
surface area it can affect.

00:10:26.126 --> 00:10:28.086 position:50% align:center
Deadbolt!

00:10:28.169 --> 00:10:29.254 position:50% align:center
Come on, let's go!

00:10:29.337 --> 00:10:31.172 position:50% align:center
This stretch won't
shift around anymore!

00:10:31.256 --> 00:10:32.716 position:50% align:center
It's narrow, but deal with it!

00:10:32.799 --> 00:10:34.592 position:50% align:center
My Security Max
Deadbolt is strong,

00:10:34.676 --> 00:10:36.386 position:50% align:center
but it can only hold
so many spots.

00:10:36.469 --> 00:10:38.763 position:50% align:center
I'm already hitting my limits.

00:10:38.847 --> 00:10:41.766 position:50% align:center
[MIMIC growls]
I can't let them through.

00:10:41.850 --> 00:10:43.518 position:50% align:center
I won't let them through!

00:10:43.601 --> 00:10:45.520 position:50% align:center
Watch the spots I
didn't lock down!

00:10:45.603 --> 00:10:47.397 position:50% align:center
He's comin' at us!

00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:51.484 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] One For All:

[DETECTIVE 70A]
He burrows through the wall,

00:10:56.573 --> 00:10:59.159 position:50% align:center
then concentrates on
one spot and attacks.

00:10:59.242 --> 00:11:01.202 position:50% align:center
It's like fighting a rabid mole.

00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:05.582 position:50% align:center
Shame we lost Fat's team.

00:11:05.665 --> 00:11:07.375 position:50% align:center
This'd be a lot easier
with them here.

00:11:07.459 --> 00:11:09.336 position:50% align:center
--Don't you think?
--[AIZAWA] Obviously.

00:11:09.419 --> 00:11:11.338 position:50% align:center
[AIZAWA]
He's pinpointing our location.

00:11:11.421 --> 00:11:15.050 position:50% align:center
But where is he watching
from? Inside the wall?

00:11:15.133 --> 00:11:17.135 position:50% align:center
We're not making
any progress, here.

00:11:17.218 --> 00:11:20.555 position:50% align:center
He just keeps cornering us!

00:11:20.638 --> 00:11:22.849 position:50% align:center
[MIMIC] The boost won't
last much longer.

00:11:22.932 --> 00:11:25.477 position:50% align:center

00:11:44.829 --> 00:11:46.581 position:50% align:center
There's a child in trouble.

00:11:46.664 --> 00:11:48.750 position:50% align:center
That's what's important here.

[AIZAWA]
Don't worry about it.

00:12:38.216 --> 00:12:40.844 position:50% align:center
Why would they bother
separating us now, though?

00:12:40.927 --> 00:12:42.387 position:50% align:center
[LOCKLOCK]
You guys okay on that side?

00:12:42.470 --> 00:12:43.847 position:50% align:center
[POLICE OFFICER 73A]
We're good, Locklock.

00:12:43.930 --> 00:12:45.598 position:50% align:center
At least we can
hear each other.

00:12:45.682 --> 00:12:48.601 position:50% align:center
Guess they couldn't flatten us,
so now they're splitting us up.

00:12:48.685 --> 00:12:51.354 position:50% align:center
I'm just happy that we're
standing on stable ground now.

00:12:51.438 --> 00:12:54.691 position:50% align:center
I suspect something
nefarious is at play here.

00:12:54.774 --> 00:12:57.235 position:50% align:center
They have a plan. Stay alert.

00:12:57.318 --> 00:12:59.154 position:50% align:center
Prepare for anything.

Today I'm a trusted member
of the old-school yakuza.

00:13:21.885 --> 00:13:23.970 position:50% align:center
A nasty little gangster girl.

00:13:24.054 --> 00:13:25.638 position:50% align:center
One who's out for blood.

00:13:25.722 --> 00:13:26.931 position:50% align:center
Lock! What's wrong?

00:13:27.015 --> 00:13:29.392 position:50% align:center
Step back. I've got this wall.

00:13:30.810 --> 00:13:32.103 position:50% align:center
Locklock!

00:13:35.357 --> 00:13:36.816 position:50% align:center
Hey, this imposter
clone just appeared

00:13:36.900 --> 00:13:39.486 position:50% align:center
out of nowhere and
attacked me! Be careful!

00:13:39.569 --> 00:13:41.738 position:50% align:center
I bet there are
more enemies nearby.

00:13:41.821 --> 00:13:43.365 position:50% align:center
[AIZAWA]
He was stabbed?

00:13:43.448 --> 00:13:45.116 position:50% align:center
[LOCKLOCK]
Midoriya, are you okay?

00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:47.494 position:50% align:center
Yeah! We should keep moving.

00:13:47.577 --> 00:13:49.621 position:50% align:center
[AIZAWA]
A knife wound and an imposter.

00:13:49.704 --> 00:13:50.914 position:50% align:center
[SIR NIGHTEYE]
We don't think the Hassaikai

00:13:50.997 --> 00:13:54.209 position:50% align:center
and the League of Villains
would work together.

00:13:54.292 --> 00:13:55.043 position:50% align:center
[yelps]

00:13:55.126 --> 00:13:56.586 position:50% align:center

Himiko Toga!

00:13:59.130 --> 00:14:01.549 position:50% align:center
[TOGA] That's me!
Your darling, in the flesh.

00:14:01.633 --> 00:14:03.677 position:50% align:center
You remembered me! Ha, ha!

00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:06.971 position:50% align:center
You have no idea how
happy I am to see you again!

00:14:07.055 --> 00:14:09.599 position:50% align:center
Come here, let's
get closer, Izuku.

00:14:11.309 --> 00:14:15.230 position:50% align:center
[AIZAWA] This is bad, but
maybe we can stop her here.

00:14:15.313 --> 00:14:17.190 position:50% align:center
This is as far as you go.

00:14:21.695 --> 00:14:22.946 position:50% align:center
Eraser!

00:14:29.244 --> 00:14:30.954 position:50% align:center
[AIZAWA]
A coordinated attack.

00:14:31.037 --> 00:14:34.416 position:50% align:center
The League and the yakuza
are working together!

00:14:34.499 --> 00:14:36.084 position:50% align:center
That's why they separated us.

00:14:36.167 --> 00:14:38.586 position:50% align:center
It was the League's
turn to step in.

00:14:38.670 --> 00:14:39.838 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Are you okay?

00:14:39.921 --> 00:14:42.173 position:50% align:center
[AIZAWA] I'm fine.
Focus on helping Locklock.

00:14:42.257 --> 00:14:43.800 position:50% align:center
And get the other knife!

00:14:43.883 --> 00:14:46.177 position:50% align:center
I've heard that Toga's Quirk
uses blood somehow.

00:14:46.261 --> 00:14:48.471 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Yes, sir!

00:14:48.555 --> 00:14:50.390 position:50% align:center
[AIZAWA] I never imagined
they'd combine forces

00:14:50.473 --> 00:14:53.727 position:50% align:center
when their first meeting
ended in bloodshed.

00:14:53.810 --> 00:14:55.520 position:50% align:center
Plus, Shigaraki
doesn't seem like

00:14:55.603 --> 00:14:59.649 position:50% align:center
the kind of person who'd
want to submit to anyone.

00:14:59.733 --> 00:15:04.154 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] That transformation.
The way her body melted.

00:15:04.237 --> 00:15:08.033 position:50% align:center
It was just like at the
exam. This is insane.

00:15:08.116 --> 00:15:11.411 position:50% align:center
The League of Villains.
What are they up to?

00:15:17.917 --> 00:15:20.337 position:50% align:center
[TOGA]
I'm so glad I came.

00:15:22.714 --> 00:15:25.925 position:50% align:center
[CHISAKI]
Say. You ever played Shogi?

00:15:26.009 --> 00:15:27.552 position:50% align:center
[SHIGARAKI]
No.

00:15:27.635 --> 00:15:29.012 position:50% align:center
[MIMIC]
Go! It's your move!

00:15:29.095 --> 00:15:31.473 position:50% align:center
[SHIGARAKI] Take it away.
I don't even know the rules.

00:15:31.556 --> 00:15:33.183 position:50% align:center
[CHISAKI]
Have an open mind.

00:15:33.266 --> 00:15:35.393 position:50% align:center
View this as a
learning experience.

00:15:35.477 --> 00:15:38.355 position:50% align:center
It'll help you understand
the bigger picture.

00:15:38.438 --> 00:15:40.231 position:50% align:center
[SHIGARAKI]
Huh?

00:15:40.315 --> 00:15:42.609 position:50% align:center
[CHISAKI] Shogi's an
interesting game because

00:15:42.692 --> 00:15:46.613 position:50% align:center
you can use the pieces you
steal from your opponent.

00:15:46.696 --> 00:15:51.034 position:50% align:center
I want Kurogiri or Toga,
and maybe Bubaigawara.

00:15:51.117 --> 00:15:54.329 position:50% align:center
I don't feel at ease when
they're doing your bidding.

00:15:54.412 --> 00:15:56.289 position:50% align:center
[SHIGARAKI]
Those are useful players.

00:15:56.373 --> 00:15:58.458 position:50% align:center
You want to clip our wings.

00:15:58.541 --> 00:16:01.127 position:50% align:center
But those three are
cornerstones of my group!

00:16:01.211 --> 00:16:02.712 position:50% align:center
You can't have 'em all.

00:16:02.796 --> 00:16:05.006 position:50% align:center
[CHISAKI]
Then how will we build trust?

00:16:05.090 --> 00:16:07.425 position:50% align:center
Right now, there's
ill will between us.

00:16:07.509 --> 00:16:10.929 position:50% align:center
Still, I told you
everything about my plan.

00:16:11.012 --> 00:16:13.515 position:50% align:center
You have to offer something
valuable in return.

00:16:13.598 --> 00:16:17.227 position:50% align:center
And your members are important
to you, aren't they?

00:16:18.395 --> 00:16:20.689 position:50% align:center
[TWICE]
I don't like this, Shigaraki.

00:16:20.772 --> 00:16:23.066 position:50% align:center
Super pumped to be here!

00:16:23.149 --> 00:16:26.528 position:50% align:center
Man, I didn't expect them
to send some suit after us.

00:16:26.611 --> 00:16:28.613 position:50% align:center
You look like
freakin' desk jockey.

00:16:28.697 --> 00:16:31.783 position:50% align:center
Don't underestimate
the yakuza, jackass!

00:16:31.866 --> 00:16:34.744 position:50% align:center
Let's fight!
Get 'em, Big Bro Rappa!

00:16:39.541 --> 00:16:42.836 position:50% align:center
You grazed my body. Impressive.

00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:53.680 position:50% align:center
Holy crap. What'd he just throw?

00:16:53.763 --> 00:16:55.724 position:50% align:center
[SIR NIGHTEYE] These
high-density personal seals

00:16:55.807 --> 00:16:57.517 position:50% align:center
are my support items.

00:16:57.600 --> 00:17:00.520 position:50% align:center
Each weighs about
five kilograms.

00:17:00.603 --> 00:17:02.480 position:50% align:center
Quite fitting aren't they?

00:17:02.564 --> 00:17:05.942 position:50% align:center
A humorous accessory
for my stiff persona.

00:17:06.026 --> 00:17:09.237 position:50% align:center
I made a prediction
and acted accordingly.

00:17:09.320 --> 00:17:10.905 position:50% align:center
Perhaps I'm able to move faster

00:17:10.989 --> 00:17:13.199 position:50% align:center
in close combat because
I've seen the choices

00:17:13.283 --> 00:17:16.870 position:50% align:center
of so many different people.

00:17:16.953 --> 00:17:19.372 position:50% align:center
But I could not
have predicted this.

00:17:19.456 --> 00:17:21.499 position:50% align:center
I didn't think the infamous
League of Villains

00:17:21.583 --> 00:17:24.461 position:50% align:center
would stoop to joining
forces with mere yakuza.

00:17:24.544 --> 00:17:27.756 position:50% align:center
[TWICE] He melted! These
mobsters are useless!

00:17:30.467 --> 00:17:32.802 position:50% align:center
[TWICE]
Damn it, you bastard!

00:17:34.012 --> 00:17:36.723 position:50% align:center
[TWICE] That wall was way
too fast, ya yakuza thug!

00:17:36.806 --> 00:17:38.892 position:50% align:center
If you'd taken any longer,
I would've been toast!

00:17:38.975 --> 00:17:40.393 position:50% align:center
What happened to
helpin' each other out?

00:17:40.477 --> 00:17:42.437 position:50% align:center
You sleepin' on the job?

00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:45.648 position:50% align:center
[TWICE] This is bad. My mask
got torn in the fight.

00:17:45.732 --> 00:17:49.402 position:50% align:center
No, no, I can't do this.

00:17:49.486 --> 00:17:51.029 position:50% align:center
My head's splitting.

00:17:51.112 --> 00:17:53.531 position:50% align:center
Aw, yeah!

00:17:53.615 --> 00:17:55.116 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna tear apart!

00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:57.619 position:50% align:center
Aww, you'll be fine!

00:17:59.162 --> 00:18:04.501 position:50% align:center
[TWICE] I need to fix this
mask. Before I split in two!

00:18:06.961 --> 00:18:07.879 position:50% align:center
You should feel whole

00:18:07.962 --> 00:18:09.631 position:50% align:center
now that you're
covered up again.

00:18:09.714 --> 00:18:10.882 position:50% align:center
[TWICE]
Toga?

00:18:10.965 --> 00:18:13.218 position:50% align:center
We're working so hard
to help these gangsters.

00:18:13.301 --> 00:18:15.220 position:50% align:center
But they're kinda useless, huh?

00:18:15.303 --> 00:18:17.847 position:50% align:center
[TWICE]
Marry me! You are the devil.

00:18:17.931 --> 00:18:21.768 position:50% align:center
[MIMIC] Ugh, these kids are
completely off their rockers.

00:18:21.851 --> 00:18:24.104 position:50% align:center
[TOGA]
I know you've gotta be hurting.

00:18:24.187 --> 00:18:27.190 position:50% align:center
You feel the most responsibility
for Big Sis Mag's death,

00:18:27.273 --> 00:18:28.900 position:50% align:center
and it's getting you down.

00:18:28.983 --> 00:18:31.236 position:50% align:center
But you've gotta be a good
bad guy and power through

00:18:31.319 --> 00:18:33.321 position:50% align:center
so we can do what we
came here to do, okay?

00:18:33.405 --> 00:18:34.531 position:50% align:center
[TWICE]
Wife-y.

00:18:34.614 --> 00:18:38.076 position:50% align:center
It's gotta be rough in
your head, Jin. So sad.

00:18:38.159 --> 00:18:41.037 position:50% align:center
But if this whole
team-up fails now,

00:18:41.121 --> 00:18:43.415 position:50% align:center
we won't get our reward.

00:18:45.291 --> 00:18:48.086 position:50% align:center
[TWICE] You want us to
work with the Hassaikai?

00:18:48.169 --> 00:18:50.672 position:50% align:center
[SHIGARAKI] Yeah. Why do
I have to keep repeating it?

00:18:50.755 --> 00:18:53.133 position:50% align:center
Their plan has some
serious potential.

00:18:53.216 --> 00:18:54.509 position:50% align:center
So from today on,

00:18:54.592 --> 00:18:57.762 position:50% align:center
Toga and Twice will
be yakuza members.

00:18:57.846 --> 00:18:59.931 position:50% align:center
[TWICE]
I don't find this joke humorous.

00:19:00.015 --> 00:19:02.308 position:50% align:center
That's hilarious, Shigaraki!

00:19:02.392 --> 00:19:06.021 position:50% align:center
[SHIGARAKI] They wanted
Kurogiri, too, but I held out.

00:19:06.104 --> 00:19:07.939 position:50% align:center
He's got his own job
to do right now,

00:19:08.023 --> 00:19:10.025 position:50% align:center
so there's no way
I can spare him.

00:19:10.108 --> 00:19:11.943 position:50% align:center
It's too important.

00:19:12.027 --> 00:19:13.903 position:50% align:center
There's an underground
route you can take to--

00:19:13.987 --> 00:19:15.530 position:50% align:center
[TWICE] What are you
thinking with this crap?

00:19:15.613 --> 00:19:17.532 position:50% align:center
Stop pretending
everything is cool.

00:19:17.615 --> 00:19:19.576 position:50% align:center
Why're you letting
this beak-faced loser

00:19:19.659 --> 00:19:20.744 position:50% align:center
give you orders?

00:19:20.827 --> 00:19:22.579 position:50% align:center
He killed Big Sis Mag!

00:19:22.662 --> 00:19:24.789 position:50% align:center
And he took Mr. Compress' arm!

00:19:24.873 --> 00:19:27.000 position:50% align:center
Did you just forget?

00:19:27.083 --> 00:19:29.044 position:50% align:center
And it's all my fault.

00:19:29.127 --> 00:19:32.213 position:50% align:center
I brought him to meet with you.

00:19:32.297 --> 00:19:34.924 position:50% align:center
I may be a villain,
but I'm human, too.

00:19:35.008 --> 00:19:37.719 position:50% align:center
We all are, man.

00:19:37.802 --> 00:19:41.473 position:50% align:center
Come on, Toga.
Don't you agree with me?

00:19:41.556 --> 00:19:43.641 position:50% align:center
[TOGA] The question I've
got for you, Tomura,

00:19:43.725 --> 00:19:45.810 position:50% align:center
is what we mean to you.

00:19:45.894 --> 00:19:49.189 position:50% align:center
To me, the League is a place
where I feel at home.

00:19:49.272 --> 00:19:51.775 position:50% align:center
I joined you 'cause
of Mr. Stainy.

00:19:51.858 --> 00:19:53.651 position:50% align:center
To make the world a
place where I can do

00:19:53.735 --> 00:19:55.987 position:50% align:center
whatever I want and live freely.

00:19:56.071 --> 00:20:02.202 position:50% align:center
It'd be such a bummer to get
distracted from my goal.

00:20:02.285 --> 00:20:04.871 position:50% align:center
I guess what I'm wondering is...

00:20:04.954 --> 00:20:06.873 position:50% align:center
Why should I do something
I don't want to do

00:20:06.956 --> 00:20:09.334 position:50% align:center
with people I wanna cut?

00:20:14.089 --> 00:20:16.049 position:50% align:center
It's simple.

00:20:20.011 --> 00:20:24.474 position:50% align:center
Because this is for all for us.

00:20:24.557 --> 00:20:26.726 position:50% align:center
They want to keep
the League in check.

00:20:26.810 --> 00:20:31.314 position:50% align:center
So they'll try to win you
two over, little by little.

00:20:31.398 --> 00:20:33.358 position:50% align:center
I want you to infiltrate them.

00:20:33.441 --> 00:20:38.905 position:50% align:center
Flatter them. But never
forget they're beneath us.

00:20:38.988 --> 00:20:42.867 position:50% align:center
Twice, you said they have
to pay for what they did.

00:20:42.951 --> 00:20:47.539 position:50% align:center
We'll make sure they do.
This will work.

00:20:47.622 --> 00:20:49.916 position:50% align:center
I believe in you guys.

00:20:51.334 --> 00:20:55.422 position:50% align:center
[TWICE] Shigaraki. I don't know
every detail of your plans,

00:20:55.505 --> 00:20:59.592 position:50% align:center
but all that matters is
you said you believe in us.

00:20:59.676 --> 00:21:03.596 position:50% align:center
I'll do this because
I am my own man.

00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:07.684 position:50% align:center
[TOGA] I'll act as
I please. Stab anyone.

00:21:07.767 --> 00:21:10.603 position:50% align:center
[TOGA, TWICE] All I have
to do is whatever I want.

00:21:10.687 --> 00:21:13.773 position:50% align:center
[TWICE] Now I understand
why the yakuza is dying out.

00:21:13.857 --> 00:21:17.610 position:50% align:center
[TOGA] Yeah! They really
are hopeless losers!

00:21:17.694 --> 00:21:20.822 position:50% align:center
'Cause your real leader's
a bedridden old man.

00:21:20.905 --> 00:21:24.534 position:50% align:center
I can't imagine anyone
more worthless than that!

00:21:26.536 --> 00:21:29.789 position:50% align:center
[screams]

00:21:29.873 --> 00:21:31.166 position:50% align:center
--[IZUKU] Whoa!
--[AIZAWA] What's this?

00:21:31.249 --> 00:21:34.502 position:50% align:center
[TWICE] Ha! Big Bro Irinaka
sure gets mad easily!

00:21:34.586 --> 00:21:38.173 position:50% align:center
The wimpiest guys always
have the worst tempers!

00:21:38.256 --> 00:21:39.841 position:50% align:center
[TWICE] Turns out the
heroes aren't the ones

00:21:39.924 --> 00:21:41.509 position:50% align:center
who need beating up the most.

00:21:41.593 --> 00:21:44.095 position:50% align:center
[TOGA] They'd probably
reject us if we asked.

00:21:44.179 --> 00:21:46.014 position:50% align:center
[TWICE]
Yeah. So...

00:21:46.097 --> 00:21:48.224 position:50% align:center
[TOGA]
Just for now...

00:21:48.308 --> 00:21:51.394 position:50% align:center
[TWICE] We'll make you
play nice with us.

00:21:51.478 --> 00:21:56.441 position:50% align:center
[MIMIC]
Crush and kill them all!

00:23:29.659 --> 00:23:31.411 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Here's the preview.

00:23:31.494 --> 00:23:34.706 position:50% align:center
Our sweep of the Hassaikai
headquarters continues.

00:23:34.789 --> 00:23:36.499 position:50% align:center
Togata is the first
person to get through

00:23:36.583 --> 00:23:39.044 position:50% align:center
the underground maze,
finally catching up

00:23:39.127 --> 00:23:41.004 position:50% align:center
to Chisaki and Eri.

00:23:41.087 --> 00:23:43.965 position:50% align:center
But in the fight to save
the girl we left behind,

00:23:44.049 --> 00:23:46.509 position:50% align:center
Togata could lose everything.

00:23:46.593 --> 00:23:48.845 position:50% align:center
Next time: "Lemillion."

00:23:48.928 --> 00:23:51.389 position:50% align:center
Please hold out as long
as you can, Togata.

00:23:51.473 --> 00:23:53.767 position:50% align:center
We're trying our
best to reach you!

00:23:53.850 --> 00:23:56.478 position:50% align:center
Go beyond! Plus Ultra!
