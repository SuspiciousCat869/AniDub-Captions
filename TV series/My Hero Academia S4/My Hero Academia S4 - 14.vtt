00:00:12.512 --> 00:00:18.685 position:50% align:center
[CHISAKI] Why doesn't anybody
see the big picture?

00:00:18.768 --> 00:00:22.230 position:50% align:center
I'm going to tear down
this entire world.

00:00:22.313 --> 00:00:25.066 position:50% align:center
Destroy its very foundation.

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:27.736 position:50% align:center
You're all blinded
by some outdated sense

00:00:27.819 --> 00:00:32.365 position:50% align:center
of what's "right." You're just
pretending to be heroes!

00:00:32.449 --> 00:00:36.703 position:50% align:center
I won't let you
stand in my way!

00:00:36.786 --> 00:00:37.912 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
When he gets injured,

00:00:37.996 --> 00:00:40.707 position:50% align:center
he has to put himself
back together again.

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:42.709 position:50% align:center
That's when I'll
have an opening.

00:00:42.792 --> 00:00:45.879 position:50% align:center
I'll hit him with 100
percent of my power.

00:00:45.962 --> 00:00:48.506 position:50% align:center
And he'll be knocked out
before he can recover.

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:50.759 position:50% align:center
If I can't save Eri...

00:00:52.052 --> 00:00:56.014 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] ...one small child who's
relying on me to help her...

[CHISAKI growls]

00:01:01.436 --> 00:01:04.230 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Then how can I call myself...

00:01:04.314 --> 00:01:07.108 position:50% align:center
...a hero who saves everybody?

00:01:12.072 --> 00:01:15.700 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
That's who I'm gonna be!

00:01:21.331 --> 00:01:25.001 position:50% align:center

[AIZAWA grunts]

00:03:03.475 --> 00:03:04.976 position:50% align:center
[KURONO]
It can't be.

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:07.479 position:50% align:center
There's no way you're
losing, is there?

00:03:07.562 --> 00:03:09.230 position:50% align:center
Kai...

00:03:09.314 --> 00:03:11.733 position:50% align:center
I've watched you ever
since you were young.

00:03:11.816 --> 00:03:13.693 position:50% align:center
You've always put a
tremendous amount of effort

00:03:13.777 --> 00:03:16.696 position:50% align:center
into preserve the dignity
of this organization.

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:19.824 position:50% align:center
To bring honor and
glory to the yakuza.

00:03:19.908 --> 00:03:21.618 position:50% align:center
If you fail today,

00:03:21.701 --> 00:03:24.621 position:50% align:center
then I'll take the finished
drug, along with the serum,

00:03:24.704 --> 00:03:26.790 position:50% align:center
and see your plan through.

00:03:29.042 --> 00:03:34.798 position:50% align:center
[KURONO] For the Hassaikai.
And for you, Kai!

00:03:34.881 --> 00:03:35.965 position:50% align:center

[AMAJIKI]
You're Kurono, right?

00:03:38.093 --> 00:03:41.721 position:50% align:center
I know how your power works, so
don't even try to use it on me.

00:03:41.805 --> 00:03:43.139 position:50% align:center
Take him.

00:03:43.223 --> 00:03:45.558 position:50% align:center
[POLICE OFFICER 77A] Don't move!
Resistance is useless!

00:03:48.311 --> 00:03:51.189 position:50% align:center
[TSUYU]
Suneater! Thank goodness.

00:03:51.272 --> 00:03:52.649 position:50% align:center
I'm glad he's okay.

00:03:52.732 --> 00:03:54.776 position:50% align:center
[AMAJIKI]
Froppy. What's happening?

00:03:54.859 --> 00:03:56.820 position:50% align:center
Deku's fighting!

00:04:00.073 --> 00:04:04.994 position:50% align:center

00:04:09.457 --> 00:04:11.334 position:50% align:center
Eri. Are you hur--

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:17.674 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Her Quirk is getting stronger!

00:04:17.757 --> 00:04:19.509 position:50% align:center
If she keeps this up...

00:04:19.592 --> 00:04:22.846 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU grunting]

00:04:30.937 --> 00:04:33.773 position:50% align:center
[BOSS]
I see. So, you got into a fight

00:04:33.857 --> 00:04:36.443 position:50% align:center
because someone
called us villains?

00:04:39.446 --> 00:04:43.074 position:50% align:center
The Yakuza can't retaliate
against civilians.

00:04:48.997 --> 00:04:51.166 position:50% align:center
[BOSS]
What you did was wrong.

00:04:51.249 --> 00:04:55.253 position:50% align:center
Though I know you were
trying to protect our honor.

00:04:55.337 --> 00:04:58.923 position:50% align:center
I appreciate that, Chisaki.

What's the situation?

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:22.530 position:50% align:center
I got Nighteye to a safe place!

00:05:22.614 --> 00:05:25.533 position:50% align:center
We've ordered civilians
to evacuate the area.

00:05:25.617 --> 00:05:27.243 position:50% align:center
Deku's fighting Chisaki!

00:05:27.327 --> 00:05:29.996 position:50% align:center
But, something seems off!

00:05:31.539 --> 00:05:35.460 position:50% align:center
[ERI]
No! Stop. He's gonna die!

00:05:35.543 --> 00:05:37.337 position:50% align:center
[CHISAKI] I always have
to get my hands dirty

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:38.922 position:50% align:center
because of your selfishness.

00:05:39.005 --> 00:05:40.465 position:50% align:center
[ERI]
No!

00:05:40.548 --> 00:05:44.219 position:50% align:center
[CHISAKI] Every action you take
results in people dying.

00:05:44.302 --> 00:05:47.097 position:50% align:center
You're a cursed human.

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:49.849 position:50% align:center
[ERI]
Don't die. Please!

00:05:53.103 --> 00:05:54.646 position:50% align:center

Ribbit.

00:05:56.690 --> 00:06:00.235 position:50% align:center
[AIZAWA]
I'm sorry, Midoriya.

00:06:00.318 --> 00:06:02.404 position:50% align:center
[ERI]
I don't want this!

00:06:11.538 --> 00:06:14.040 position:50% align:center
[sighs] It's over.

00:06:14.124 --> 00:06:16.167 position:50% align:center
Thank goodness.

00:06:18.628 --> 00:06:22.590 position:50% align:center
[BOTH panting]

00:06:22.674 --> 00:06:24.926 position:50% align:center
[RYUKYU] We have a lot of
seriously injured people here!

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:28.096 position:50% align:center
We need ambulances! Quickly!

00:06:28.179 --> 00:06:30.765 position:50% align:center
Check to make sure we
didn't miss any victims.

00:06:30.849 --> 00:06:33.268 position:50% align:center
The League of Villains
may still be nearby!

00:06:33.351 --> 00:06:34.269 position:50% align:center
Search for them!

00:06:34.352 --> 00:06:35.645 position:50% align:center
[POLICE OFFICER 77B]
Yes, ma'am!

00:07:25.278 --> 00:07:27.280 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] She got a fever
after she passed out.

00:07:27.364 --> 00:07:29.783 position:50% align:center
She's safe. She just
needs a hospital.

00:07:29.866 --> 00:07:30.867 position:50% align:center
You, too, kid.

00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:32.243 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Yes, sir.

00:07:32.327 --> 00:07:34.496 position:50% align:center
[PARAMEDIC 77A]
His pulse is dropping! Hurry!

00:07:36.956 --> 00:07:40.293 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Sir! Can you hear me?

00:07:40.377 --> 00:07:42.545 position:50% align:center
There's something I've
been meaning to tell you.

00:07:42.629 --> 00:07:45.840 position:50% align:center
[SIR NIGHTEYE]
Midoriya...

00:07:45.924 --> 00:07:47.300 position:50% align:center
[SIR NIGHTEYE]
This is a different outcome

00:07:47.384 --> 00:07:50.011 position:50% align:center
than the one I foresaw.

00:07:50.095 --> 00:07:54.974 position:50% align:center
I don't understand why
things have changed, but...

00:07:55.058 --> 00:08:00.730 position:50% align:center
...somehow he made
my wish into a reality.

00:08:00.814 --> 00:08:05.568 position:50% align:center
Midoriya. You
twisted the future.

00:08:05.652 --> 00:08:09.447 position:50% align:center
You did the impossible.

00:08:09.531 --> 00:08:11.533 position:50% align:center
Sir. About All Might.

00:08:11.616 --> 00:08:13.284 position:50% align:center
He said he'll live.

00:08:13.368 --> 00:08:15.704 position:50% align:center
He told me he couldn't
face you, but...

00:08:15.787 --> 00:08:17.330 position:50% align:center
You have to see him again!

00:08:17.414 --> 00:08:19.791 position:50% align:center
I know he wants that.

00:08:19.874 --> 00:08:23.253 position:50% align:center
So, you have to pull through.

00:08:23.336 --> 00:08:25.922 position:50% align:center
[PARAMEDIC 77B] We're in
a hurry. Please stay back.

00:08:33.096 --> 00:08:36.766 position:50% align:center
[RYUKYU] Midoriya.
Many people were hurt today,

00:08:36.850 --> 00:08:40.353 position:50% align:center
so this isn't really
the time to celebrate.

00:08:40.437 --> 00:08:43.523 position:50% align:center
But...

00:08:43.606 --> 00:08:45.525 position:50% align:center
...thanks for all you did.

00:08:48.278 --> 00:08:51.865 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] And with that, the
battle to save a single girl

00:08:51.948 --> 00:08:54.242 position:50% align:center
finally came to an end.

00:09:01.541 --> 00:09:03.001 position:50% align:center
[POLICE OFFICER 77C]
We're currently transporting

00:09:03.084 --> 00:09:06.212 position:50% align:center
11 members of Shie Hassaikai
to Tocadana Villain Hospital.

00:09:06.296 --> 00:09:08.381 position:50% align:center
They have all sustained
serious injuries.

00:09:08.465 --> 00:09:10.717 position:50% align:center
Their personal belongings
have been confiscated.

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:12.844 position:50% align:center
In addition to the bullets
we were told about,

00:09:12.927 --> 00:09:16.431 position:50% align:center
we've also found previously
unreported capsules--

00:09:16.514 --> 00:09:18.016 position:50% align:center
[POLICE OFFICER 77D]
What's that?

00:09:20.226 --> 00:09:24.814 position:50% align:center
[SHIGARAKI] In shogi, the point
is to take out the king, right?

00:09:24.898 --> 00:09:26.775 position:50% align:center
It's not exactly that simple.

00:09:26.858 --> 00:09:29.110 position:50% align:center
[MR. COMPRESS] Indeed!
They're here, just as you said!

00:09:29.194 --> 00:09:30.945 position:50% align:center
This was the fastest
route from the yakuza

00:09:31.029 --> 00:09:33.239 position:50% align:center
headquarters to the
nearest villain hospital.

00:09:33.323 --> 00:09:34.866 position:50% align:center
The stage is now set!

00:09:34.949 --> 00:09:36.701 position:50% align:center
Thanks for letting us know.

00:09:36.785 --> 00:09:39.996 position:50% align:center
You're so efficient, Toga.
You deserve a round of applause.

00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:41.998 position:50% align:center
[TOGA] Jin's the one
who reminded me to call.

00:09:42.082 --> 00:09:43.166 position:50% align:center
[TWICE]
Fight!

00:09:43.249 --> 00:09:45.293 position:50% align:center
I got a little distracted
watching Izuku.

00:09:45.377 --> 00:09:46.628 position:50% align:center
[TWICE]
Run away! Fast!

00:09:46.711 --> 00:09:47.712 position:50% align:center
Sorry we're not there,

00:09:47.796 --> 00:09:49.422 position:50% align:center
so you have to get
your hands dirty.

00:09:49.506 --> 00:09:52.801 position:50% align:center
[MR. COMPRESS]
Just the one hand, my dear.

00:09:52.884 --> 00:09:55.303 position:50% align:center
We couldn't get the girl
at the center of their plan,

00:09:55.387 --> 00:09:57.097 position:50% align:center
but we're pretty sure
you'll have no problem

00:09:57.180 --> 00:09:59.474 position:50% align:center
intercepting the
finished product.

00:09:59.557 --> 00:10:01.267 position:50% align:center
We also watched the
cops as they loaded

00:10:01.351 --> 00:10:04.646 position:50% align:center
everybody up and I didn't
see them take anything.

00:10:04.729 --> 00:10:06.690 position:50% align:center
Even if you don't get
what we're after...

00:10:06.773 --> 00:10:08.525 position:50% align:center
[TWICE]
Kill them!

00:10:08.608 --> 00:10:11.111 position:50% align:center
[TOGA] I bet you still
wanna say "hi," right?

00:10:11.194 --> 00:10:12.487 position:50% align:center
[POLICE OFFICER 77D]
Oh, crap.

00:10:12.570 --> 00:10:15.281 position:50% align:center
That's Tomura Shigaraki
from the League of Villains!

00:10:15.365 --> 00:10:18.618 position:50% align:center
Hey, lizard! Stop weaving!
I get motion sick.

00:10:18.702 --> 00:10:21.162 position:50% align:center
Don't call me "lizard"!
The name is Spinner!

00:10:21.246 --> 00:10:23.248 position:50% align:center
[DABI]
Shut up and focus on driving.

00:10:23.331 --> 00:10:26.292 position:50% align:center
What would Stain say about this?
Is attacking the police in line

00:10:26.376 --> 00:10:28.962 position:50% align:center
with his desires for
a true hero society?

00:10:29.045 --> 00:10:31.214 position:50% align:center
I'm not so sure he'd approve.

00:10:31.297 --> 00:10:34.009 position:50% align:center
[SHIGARAKI] It's a necessary
sacrifice, Spinner.

00:10:34.092 --> 00:10:35.927 position:50% align:center
I'm counting on you.

00:10:37.262 --> 00:10:38.638 position:50% align:center
Let's go.

00:10:45.103 --> 00:10:46.771 position:50% align:center
[DABI]
What is this?

00:10:51.901 --> 00:10:53.278 position:50% align:center
The League of Villains!

00:10:53.361 --> 00:10:55.572 position:50% align:center line:10%
Thugs with a grudge
against this world.

00:10:55.655 --> 00:10:58.533 position:50% align:center
[SHIGARAKI] Ugh. Of course
they sent a hero with them.

00:10:58.616 --> 00:11:01.453 position:50% align:center
What a pain. Spinner, slow down!

00:11:06.416 --> 00:11:08.793 position:50% align:center
Not so fast!

00:11:08.877 --> 00:11:11.296 position:50% align:center
You may be able to disintegrate
whatever you touch,

00:11:11.379 --> 00:11:13.506 position:50% align:center
but that won't
work against sand!

00:11:13.590 --> 00:11:15.800 position:50% align:center
[SHIGARAKI]
Yeah, you've got a point.

00:11:15.884 --> 00:11:17.719 position:50% align:center
He's getting pretty famous.

00:11:17.802 --> 00:11:20.055 position:50% align:center
[MR. COMPRESS] Shigaraki
is only a misdirection.

00:11:20.138 --> 00:11:22.098 position:50% align:center
A little slight of hand,
if you will.

00:11:22.182 --> 00:11:23.600 position:50% align:center
Now...

00:11:26.853 --> 00:11:28.605 position:50% align:center
[MR. COMPRESS] Watch carefully
as the police car

be able to see her?

00:16:34.452 --> 00:16:35.870 position:50% align:center
[AIZAWA]
You know, they made that call

00:16:35.954 --> 00:16:39.082 position:50% align:center
based on your description
of what happened back there.

00:16:39.165 --> 00:16:42.377 position:50% align:center
She's got a dangerous Quirk
and no control over it.

00:16:42.460 --> 00:16:45.422 position:50% align:center
If something provokes her
enough to activate it again,

00:16:45.505 --> 00:16:48.383 position:50% align:center
I'm the only one
who can stop her.

00:16:48.466 --> 00:16:50.051 position:50% align:center
You were only able
to touch her because

00:16:50.135 --> 00:16:51.302 position:50% align:center
you kept destroying your body

00:16:51.386 --> 00:16:53.930 position:50% align:center
faster than she could
rewind it, right?

00:16:54.014 --> 00:16:54.973 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Yeah.

00:16:55.056 --> 00:16:56.599 position:50% align:center
There aren't exactly
a lot of people

00:16:56.683 --> 00:16:58.143 position:50% align:center
who could pull that off.

00:16:58.226 --> 00:16:59.728 position:50% align:center
And even if there were,

00:16:59.811 --> 00:17:02.147 position:50% align:center
who's to say how
powerful she really is?

00:17:02.230 --> 00:17:04.733 position:50% align:center
We have no idea
what her limits are.

00:17:04.816 --> 00:17:06.443 position:50% align:center
I know what you mean.

00:17:06.526 --> 00:17:08.987 position:50% align:center
If you hadn't been
there to make her stop,

00:17:09.070 --> 00:17:11.781 position:50% align:center
I'm not sure what
would've happened.

00:17:11.865 --> 00:17:13.908 position:50% align:center
Teaching her control
will be especially hard

00:17:13.992 --> 00:17:16.786 position:50% align:center
since her Quirk only
seems to work on people.

00:17:16.870 --> 00:17:18.288 position:50% align:center
When you're training
on live subjects,

00:17:18.371 --> 00:17:20.915 position:50% align:center
the danger is
exponentially greater.

00:17:20.999 --> 00:17:23.501 position:50% align:center
Her emotional state
will be a factor, too.

00:17:23.585 --> 00:17:24.669 position:50% align:center
With so many unknowns,

00:17:24.753 --> 00:17:26.546 position:50% align:center
it makes sense to
keep her quarantined.

00:17:26.629 --> 00:17:31.509 position:50% align:center
For her sake, as well
as ours. In other words,

00:17:31.593 --> 00:17:34.637 position:50% align:center
we can't depend on the girl
or her Quirk right now.

00:17:34.721 --> 00:17:36.139 position:50% align:center

help him, either.

[DOCTOR 77B] I'm sorry, but you
should prepare yourselves.

live to see tomorrow.

I'm so sorry.

Is that you, All Might?

You feel like talking,

00:18:27.941 --> 00:18:30.068 position:50% align:center
[ALL MIGHT]
I don't know what to say.

00:18:30.151 --> 00:18:33.446 position:50% align:center
I was wrong. I pushed
you away, and now...

00:18:41.287 --> 00:18:46.751 position:50% align:center
But I didn't resent you for
what happened between us.

00:18:46.835 --> 00:18:49.671 position:50% align:center
I mean that. All I wanted

00:18:49.754 --> 00:18:51.548 position:50% align:center
was for you to be happy.

00:18:51.631 --> 00:18:53.925 position:50% align:center
And if you've decided
to fight fate, then I--

00:19:00.849 --> 00:19:03.601 position:50% align:center
[SIR NIGHTEYE]
There's nothing to make up for.

00:19:03.685 --> 00:19:05.770 position:50% align:center
I wanted to change the future.

00:19:05.854 --> 00:19:08.940 position:50% align:center
To keep you from being killed.

00:19:09.024 --> 00:19:12.068 position:50% align:center
I looked for ways to
alter the fate I'd seen.

00:19:12.152 --> 00:19:17.240 position:50% align:center
I tried, but there was
nothing I could do.

And then today, Midoriya
succeeded where I failed.

I believe...

00:19:24.539 --> 00:19:29.002 position:50% align:center
...it might have to do with the
energy contained in thoughts.

it leaves no room for doubt,

00:19:33.631 --> 00:19:36.718 position:50% align:center
and strives toward
the desired future.

00:19:36.801 --> 00:19:39.137 position:50% align:center
It wasn't just Midoriya.

00:19:39.220 --> 00:19:41.181 position:50% align:center
Everyone there truly
believed that

00:19:41.264 --> 00:19:44.559 position:50% align:center
what they were fighting
for could come to pass.

00:19:44.642 --> 00:19:47.187 position:50% align:center
Maybe what we saw
today was the result

00:19:47.270 --> 00:19:52.942 position:50% align:center
of that energy converging on
Midoriya and being released.

00:19:53.026 --> 00:19:55.820 position:50% align:center
You've changed my thinking.

00:19:55.904 --> 00:19:59.449 position:50% align:center
You've shown me the future
isn't set in stone.

00:19:59.532 --> 00:20:02.952 position:50% align:center
And that's enough for me.

00:20:03.036 --> 00:20:05.705 position:50% align:center
I only have one regret left.

00:20:05.789 --> 00:20:07.415 position:50% align:center
Sir!

00:20:07.499 --> 00:20:08.625 position:50% align:center
Togata!

00:20:08.708 --> 00:20:12.295 position:50% align:center
Don't give up!
Please, keep fighting!

00:20:12.379 --> 00:20:14.673 position:50% align:center
Don't die on me!

00:20:14.756 --> 00:20:17.884 position:50% align:center
Mirio. I failed you.

00:20:17.967 --> 00:20:22.430 position:50% align:center
This is my fault.
If only I'd been there--

00:20:22.514 --> 00:20:25.850 position:50% align:center
[TOGATA] Don't say that!
You were always there,

00:20:25.934 --> 00:20:28.561 position:50% align:center
teaching me and showing
me how to be strong!

00:20:28.645 --> 00:20:32.315 position:50% align:center
Everything I am now is because
of you--don't you see?

00:20:32.399 --> 00:20:36.361 position:50% align:center
I'm not ready!
Please don't leave me!

00:20:36.444 --> 00:20:41.157 position:50% align:center
[SIR NIGHTEYE]
Mirio. Forgive me.

00:20:41.241 --> 00:20:43.576 position:50% align:center
In the beginning,
I only looked at you

00:20:43.660 --> 00:20:46.663 position:50% align:center
as a potential vessel
for One For All.

00:20:46.746 --> 00:20:50.875 position:50% align:center
But you followed me.
You believed in me.

00:20:50.959 --> 00:20:56.631 position:50% align:center
And before I knew it,
you became my pride and joy.

00:20:56.715 --> 00:21:00.802 position:50% align:center
One last time. Let me see.

00:21:06.641 --> 00:21:08.601 position:50% align:center
You'll be okay.

00:21:08.685 --> 00:21:11.896 position:50% align:center
You're going to
become the finest hero

00:21:11.980 --> 00:21:14.774 position:50% align:center
the world's ever seen.

00:21:14.858 --> 00:21:19.362 position:50% align:center
That's one part of the future
that shouldn't be changed.

00:21:20.655 --> 00:21:24.325 position:50% align:center
Work hard and be sure to smile.

00:21:24.409 --> 00:21:29.456 position:50% align:center
[whimpers]

00:21:29.539 --> 00:21:32.417 position:50% align:center
After all, without
joy and laughter

00:21:32.500 --> 00:21:34.377 position:50% align:center
to balance the sorrow,

00:21:34.461 --> 00:21:37.297 position:50% align:center
this world cannot
hope to have...

00:21:37.380 --> 00:21:39.424 position:50% align:center
...a bright...

00:21:39.507 --> 00:21:41.551 position:50% align:center
...future.

00:23:29.409 --> 00:23:30.952 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Here's the preview!

00:23:31.036 --> 00:23:34.748 position:50% align:center
Our fight against the Shie
Hassaikai had finally ended,

00:23:34.831 --> 00:23:37.584 position:50% align:center
and we were able
to change the future.

00:23:37.667 --> 00:23:41.046 position:50% align:center
But, there were more
trials to come.

00:23:41.129 --> 00:23:44.549 position:50% align:center
As we battled our grief over
the loss of Sir Nighteye,

00:23:44.632 --> 00:23:46.176 position:50% align:center
the League of Villains
began putting

00:23:46.259 --> 00:23:48.762 position:50% align:center
new plans into motion.

00:23:48.845 --> 00:23:51.556 position:50% align:center
Next time: "Smoldering Flames."

00:23:51.639 --> 00:23:54.768 position:50% align:center
This could just be the
calm before the storm.

00:23:54.851 --> 00:23:57.437 position:50% align:center
Go beyond! Plus Ultra!
