[AMAJIKI] Clams are good
for offense or defense.

00:08:08.822 --> 00:08:10.073 position:50% align:center
They're very handy.

00:08:10.156 --> 00:08:13.576 position:50% align:center

00:08:22.002 --> 00:08:23.795 position:50% align:center
He got the tentacles
from takoyaki,

00:08:23.878 --> 00:08:25.755 position:50% align:center
that rockin' hand
from clam preserves,

00:08:25.839 --> 00:08:29.259 position:50% align:center
and the wings and claws from
a helping of fried chicken.

00:08:29.342 --> 00:08:31.052 position:50% align:center
Guess the wings were overkill.

00:08:31.136 --> 00:08:32.595 position:50% align:center

That was awesome.

00:08:32.679 --> 00:08:34.889 position:50% align:center
Except... I didn't
get to do anything.

00:08:34.973 --> 00:08:37.267 position:50% align:center
Was that okay? It felt terrible.

00:08:37.350 --> 00:08:38.810 position:50% align:center
Are you kidding?

Yeah, our Suneater's got
some serious talent.

His mental game needs work.

[SHIGARAKI] A strange thing
happened to Compress

after he was shot with this.

00:09:09.382 --> 00:09:11.926 position:50% align:center
He couldn't use his
Quirk for a while.

00:09:12.010 --> 00:09:15.722 position:50% align:center
So I'd like to know
what this is,

00:09:15.805 --> 00:09:18.224 position:50% align:center
