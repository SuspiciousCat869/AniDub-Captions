00:00:10.427 --> 00:00:13.722 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] As November neared
its end, we got great news.

00:00:15.557 --> 00:00:17.183 position:50% align:center
Eri's coming to live at UA.

00:00:17.267 --> 00:00:20.186 position:50% align:center
I thought it'd be forever
till I saw her again!

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:21.104 position:50% align:center
Hey.

00:00:21.187 --> 00:00:22.647 position:50% align:center
I'm so glad you're here.

00:00:22.731 --> 00:00:25.483 position:50% align:center
Welcome home. You remind
me of my little sister.

00:00:25.567 --> 00:00:26.526 position:50% align:center
You're cute like her!

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.070 position:50% align:center
Gee, thank you so much!

00:00:29.154 --> 00:00:31.322 position:50% align:center
How is this even possible?

00:00:31.406 --> 00:00:34.159 position:50% align:center
[AIZAWA] We couldn't make her
stay at the hospital forever.

00:00:36.911 --> 00:00:38.121 position:50% align:center
[AIZAWA]
From what we can tell,

00:00:38.204 --> 00:00:40.373 position:50% align:center
Eri was abandoned
by her parents.

00:00:40.457 --> 00:00:43.835 position:50% align:center
We know the head of the Shie
Hassaikai is her blood relative,

00:00:43.918 --> 00:00:45.879 position:50% align:center
but he's been in a coma
for quite a while.

00:00:45.962 --> 00:00:47.630 position:50% align:center
She has nowhere else to go.

00:00:47.714 --> 00:00:48.923 position:50% align:center
That's not all.

00:00:49.007 --> 00:00:51.051 position:50% align:center
Mr. Aizawa may have
mentioned this already.

00:00:51.134 --> 00:00:52.719 position:50% align:center
The docs figured out Eri's horn

00:00:52.802 --> 00:00:54.262 position:50% align:center
is where her Quirk
is released from.

00:00:54.346 --> 00:00:58.183 position:50% align:center
Yeah. He said it'd gotten
smaller, so it should be fine.

00:00:58.266 --> 00:00:59.976 position:50% align:center
[MIRIO]
Truth. It had.

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:02.687 position:50% align:center
But it's slowly starting
to get bigger again.

00:01:02.771 --> 00:01:05.815 position:50% align:center
Meaning, in order to keep
an eye on her power...

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:07.359 position:50% align:center
[AIZAWA]
Exactly.

00:01:07.442 --> 00:01:10.070 position:50% align:center
So, that's why we're going
to let her live here

00:01:10.153 --> 00:01:12.364 position:50% align:center
instead of putting her
into the system.

00:01:12.447 --> 00:01:15.784 position:50% align:center
We'll set up a room for
her in the teachers' dorm.

00:01:15.867 --> 00:01:18.370 position:50% align:center
Hopefully she'll be happy
and we can help her find a way

00:01:18.453 --> 00:01:21.039 position:50% align:center
to harness her tremendous power.

00:01:21.122 --> 00:01:23.458 position:50% align:center
This is only our
first step though.

00:01:23.541 --> 00:01:25.835 position:50% align:center
Clearly, it's a long road.

00:01:25.919 --> 00:01:28.088 position:50% align:center
Sounds like it's gonna
be a lot of work for you.

00:01:28.171 --> 00:01:29.506 position:50% align:center
[MIRIO]
That's where I come in!

00:01:29.589 --> 00:01:31.466 position:50% align:center
I'm on a temp leave from
school right now and I'm

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:34.386 position:50% align:center
super buddy-buddy with our
little Eri, so I'm helpin' out.

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:36.054 position:50% align:center
I know you guys
are majorly busy.

00:01:36.137 --> 00:01:38.139 position:50% align:center
But I'm hoping you'll
stop by and say hi?

00:01:38.223 --> 00:01:40.684 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU, KIRISHIMA]
Of course we will!

00:01:40.767 --> 00:01:42.477 position:50% align:center
If Eri's Quirks becomes useable

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.854 position:50% align:center
and she learns how
to control it,

00:01:44.938 --> 00:01:48.316 position:50% align:center
then I bet we'll have our
invincible man back in no time.

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.319 position:50% align:center
Man, that'd be awesome, right?
Guess we'll see though!

00:01:51.403 --> 00:01:53.196 position:50% align:center
[AIZAWA] Sorry to be
asking for help already,

00:01:53.279 --> 00:01:54.531 position:50% align:center
but can you get her settled in?

00:01:54.614 --> 00:01:56.491 position:50% align:center
Roger, sir! We'll play
some board games!

00:01:56.574 --> 00:01:58.034 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Do you mind if we join you?

00:01:58.118 --> 00:02:00.704 position:50% align:center
[AIZAWA]
I do. Go back to the dorms.

00:02:00.787 --> 00:02:03.498 position:50% align:center
You have visitors.
They'll be here soon.

00:03:34.005 --> 00:03:36.091 position:50% align:center
Ah... choo!

00:03:36.174 --> 00:03:38.093 position:50% align:center
[OCHACO]
Uh-oh! I hope you're not sick.

00:03:38.176 --> 00:03:39.594 position:50% align:center
[TOKOYAMI]
I am quite well.

00:03:39.678 --> 00:03:41.721 position:50% align:center
My mucus membranes are
merely doing their job.

00:03:41.805 --> 00:03:43.098 position:50% align:center
[OCHACO]
Uh, what?

00:03:43.181 --> 00:03:45.642 position:50% align:center
Or someone's talkin' about you!
Maybe you've got fans!

00:03:45.725 --> 00:03:48.061 position:50% align:center
Like the ones who showed for
Yaoyorozu at the concert?

00:03:48.144 --> 00:03:49.979 position:50% align:center
Don't you make fun
of them, Kaminari.

00:03:50.063 --> 00:03:51.523 position:50% align:center
I'm lucky to have them.

00:03:51.606 --> 00:03:54.067 position:50% align:center
Tokoyami's probably had
fans for a while now.

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:55.527 position:50% align:center
He did his work
study with Hawks,

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:57.654 position:50% align:center
so I bet he's got
some street cred.

00:03:57.737 --> 00:03:59.989 position:50% align:center
No. Likely not.

00:04:00.073 --> 00:04:01.866 position:50% align:center
Everything moved too fast there.

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:03.034 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:04:03.118 --> 00:04:04.703 position:50% align:center
[knocking]

00:04:04.786 --> 00:04:07.330 position:50% align:center
[TENYA] Our guests have arrived.
Let's welcome them!

00:04:07.414 --> 00:04:09.708 position:50% align:center
Your feline fantasies are here.

00:04:09.791 --> 00:04:11.960 position:50% align:center
Allow us to lend a helping paw!

00:04:12.043 --> 00:04:14.421 position:50% align:center
We're champions
serving up justice.

00:04:14.504 --> 00:04:16.756 position:50% align:center
Purrfectly cute,
catlike heroes!

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:20.802 position:50% align:center
[ALL]
We're the Wild, Wild Pussycats!

00:04:20.885 --> 00:04:23.471 position:50% align:center
How unexpected! Glad to see you.

00:04:23.555 --> 00:04:27.100 position:50% align:center
[PIXIE-BOB] Seems our little
kittens are doing well.

00:04:27.183 --> 00:04:30.145 position:50% align:center
I couldn't protect you
back then. I apologize.

00:04:30.228 --> 00:04:32.272 position:50% align:center
I already forgot about that.

00:04:32.355 --> 00:04:35.025 position:50% align:center
We're all doing
pretty good, right?

00:04:35.108 --> 00:04:38.319 position:50% align:center
[ALL] Paw pad buns! They
brought us paw pad buns!

00:04:38.403 --> 00:04:39.487 position:50% align:center

Make yourself at home.

00:04:39.571 --> 00:04:41.990 position:50% align:center
No. Thank you.
But we can't stay long.

00:04:42.073 --> 00:04:44.701 position:50% align:center
We need to visit Class B, too.

00:04:45.952 --> 00:04:48.079 position:50% align:center
Ohmigosh, Kota,
I'm so happy to see you!

00:04:48.163 --> 00:04:49.706 position:50% align:center
Thank you for your
heartfelt letter!

00:04:49.789 --> 00:04:51.332 position:50% align:center
I'll treasure it forever!

00:04:51.416 --> 00:04:53.543 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Sure.

00:04:53.626 --> 00:04:55.128 position:50% align:center
Do his shoes look familiar?

00:04:55.211 --> 00:04:56.338 position:50% align:center
Uh?

00:04:56.421 --> 00:04:58.256 position:50% align:center
[MANDALAY]
Kota picked them out himself.

00:04:58.340 --> 00:04:59.716 position:50% align:center
He specifically asked for red.

00:04:59.799 --> 00:05:01.634 position:50% align:center
[KOTA]
Ah! It's not what you think!

00:05:01.718 --> 00:05:03.219 position:50% align:center
Awesome. We match!

00:05:03.303 --> 00:05:05.722 position:50% align:center
Uh... Hmph.

00:05:05.805 --> 00:05:08.475 position:50% align:center
It's great to see you,
but, why are you here?

00:05:08.558 --> 00:05:10.477 position:50% align:center
Just to let you know,
we're back in business.

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:11.519 position:50% align:center
Seriously?

00:05:11.603 --> 00:05:13.605 position:50% align:center
Congratulations!
That's wonderful!

00:05:13.688 --> 00:05:15.690 position:50% align:center
Are you back at work
again, too, Ragdoll?

00:05:15.774 --> 00:05:18.610 position:50% align:center
I know you took time off when
your Quirk got stolen, so...

00:05:18.693 --> 00:05:20.862 position:50% align:center
[RAGDOLL]
Still powerless!

00:05:20.945 --> 00:05:22.614 position:50% align:center
I'll be working behind
the scenes to support

00:05:22.697 --> 00:05:25.992 position:50% align:center
the other three in the field.
Call me the office cat.

00:05:26.076 --> 00:05:30.038 position:50% align:center
We received a report from
Tartarus prison recently.

00:05:30.121 --> 00:05:31.623 position:50% align:center
[ALL FOR ONE]
I feel simply terrible

00:05:31.706 --> 00:05:34.292 position:50% align:center
about taking her ability.

00:05:34.376 --> 00:05:37.796 position:50% align:center
When I see a good Quirk,
I can't help but desire it.

00:05:37.879 --> 00:05:40.215 position:50% align:center
Quite the bad habit, yes?

00:05:40.298 --> 00:05:42.550 position:50% align:center
I'd love to return
it to the girl,

00:05:42.634 --> 00:05:45.720 position:50% align:center
but you'd have to let
me use my power.

00:05:45.804 --> 00:05:50.225 position:50% align:center
If that's amenable to you,
then I'd be happy to help out.

00:05:50.308 --> 00:05:51.476 position:50% align:center
Thing is,

00:05:51.559 --> 00:05:53.978 position:50% align:center
they still don't know
how many powers he has.

00:05:54.062 --> 00:05:57.190 position:50% align:center
He could be hiding some
dangerous Quirks.

00:05:57.273 --> 00:05:59.150 position:50% align:center
Which unfortunately means
the smartest way

00:05:59.234 --> 00:06:02.987 position:50% align:center
to contain him is to not
let him use any abilities.

00:06:03.071 --> 00:06:05.907 position:50% align:center
So why choose this moment
to go back into action?

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:08.368 position:50% align:center
[MANDALAY] This will be
announced later, but...

00:06:08.451 --> 00:06:11.329 position:50% align:center
It's our spot on the Japanese
Hero Billboard Chart.

00:06:11.413 --> 00:06:14.791 position:50% align:center
You see, we're ranked
411 this term.

00:06:14.874 --> 00:06:17.127 position:50% align:center
[PRESENT MIC] The Japanese
Hero Billboard Chart!

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:18.670 position:50% align:center
Rankings are based
on the total number

00:06:18.753 --> 00:06:21.381 position:50% align:center
of incidents resolved,
contribution to society,

00:06:21.464 --> 00:06:23.299 position:50% align:center
and approval rating
from citizens.

00:06:23.383 --> 00:06:25.885 position:50% align:center
Active heroes are
ranked twice a year.

00:06:25.969 --> 00:06:27.679 position:50% align:center
In other words,
the higher the spot,

00:06:27.762 --> 00:06:29.723 position:50% align:center
the more peace, light,
and happiness a hero

00:06:29.806 --> 00:06:32.767 position:50% align:center
has brought to his country.

00:06:32.851 --> 00:06:35.645 position:50% align:center
Wow, last time, you guys
came in at number 32.

00:06:35.729 --> 00:06:38.314 position:50% align:center
So it's cause your rank went
down. That makes sense.

00:06:38.398 --> 00:06:41.484 position:50% align:center
No, silly! Isn't it weird that
we're still in the triple digits

00:06:41.568 --> 00:06:43.945 position:50% align:center
even though we haven't
done any hero work?

[BOTH gasp]

00:06:45.113 --> 00:06:46.740 position:50% align:center
[TIGER]
It's due to our approval rating.

00:06:46.823 --> 00:06:49.159 position:50% align:center
That number gave us a big boost.

00:06:49.242 --> 00:06:51.411 position:50% align:center
There are people waiting
for us to return.

00:06:51.494 --> 00:06:54.289 position:50% align:center
No way can we just
stay on the sidelines!

00:06:54.372 --> 00:06:56.291 position:50% align:center

for the second half
of the year yet.

00:07:05.592 --> 00:07:07.427 position:50% align:center

[OJIRO] A chart without All

00:18:25.980 --> 00:18:28.483 position:50% align:center
they found a few dozen

The League has been
plenty busy since then,

00:18:30.276 --> 00:18:34.072 position:50% align:center
but, suspiciously, no more of
the creatures have appeared.

00:18:34.155 --> 00:18:36.950 position:50% align:center
We might have snagged them
all, or maybe old AFO

00:18:37.033 --> 00:18:38.827 position:50% align:center
was hiding the rest
somewhere else.

00:18:38.910 --> 00:18:41.913 position:50% align:center

is looking for them.

Bet that's news for ya.

00:19:03.059 --> 00:19:05.687 position:50% align:center
There've been reported sightings
from across the country.

00:19:05.770 --> 00:19:08.982 position:50% align:center
Not so much that the media's
picked up on them quite yet,

00:19:09.065 --> 00:19:10.817 position:50% align:center
but there's been plenty
of neighborhood gossip

00:19:10.900 --> 00:19:12.569 position:50% align:center
about monsters.
That kind of talk

00:19:12.652 --> 00:19:15.238 position:50% align:center
gets filtered down to
students and spreads quickly.

What is it you know?

00:19:17.282 --> 00:19:18.950 position:50% align:center
The first time I
heard about one,

00:19:19.034 --> 00:19:21.661 position:50% align:center
I was on a trip,
talking to some locals.

00:19:21.745 --> 00:19:24.205 position:50% align:center
I looked into the case with
the help of the police.

00:19:24.289 --> 00:19:25.707 position:50% align:center
A quiet investigation.

00:19:25.790 --> 00:19:28.835 position:50% align:center
I couldn't find anything,
though. We came up dry.

00:19:28.918 --> 00:19:31.588 position:50% align:center
But it made me
a little curious.

00:19:31.671 --> 00:19:36.092 position:50% align:center
So I flew around the country.
Did some digging on my own.

00:19:36.176 --> 00:19:37.344 position:50% align:center

Some details were different,

00:19:39.012 --> 00:19:41.097 position:50% align:center
but similar rumors were
popping up in areas

that were completely
unconnected with each other.

00:19:43.641 --> 00:19:47.103 position:50% align:center
Still, there was no
proof. Only talk.

Now, this is just my opinion,

00:19:48.938 --> 00:19:54.277 position:50% align:center

Hosu, and Kamino...
