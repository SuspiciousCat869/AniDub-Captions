00:00:12.178 --> 00:00:14.597 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] This world
is a superhuman society,

00:00:14.681 --> 00:00:16.641 position:50% align:center
with about 80 percent
of the population

00:00:16.725 --> 00:00:19.769 position:50% align:center
possessing some uncanny
ability called a "Quirk."

00:00:19.853 --> 00:00:21.813 position:50% align:center
My name is Izuku Midoriya,

00:00:21.896 --> 00:00:25.191 position:50% align:center
and I was born Quirkless,
but my life completely changed

00:00:25.275 --> 00:00:28.153 position:50% align:center
when I met the
number-one pro, All Might.

00:00:28.236 --> 00:00:31.614 position:50% align:center
He transferred his Quirk,
One For All, to me.

00:00:31.698 --> 00:00:34.993 position:50% align:center
After that,
I enrolled at UA High,

00:00:35.076 --> 00:00:38.913 position:50% align:center
the prestigious school known for
producing first-class heroes.

00:00:38.997 --> 00:00:40.832 position:50% align:center
I continue to run
toward my dream

00:00:40.915 --> 00:00:44.127 position:50% align:center
along with the friends
I've made on my journey.

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:46.588 position:50% align:center
This is the story
of how I became

00:00:46.671 --> 00:00:49.090 position:50% align:center
the world's greatest hero.

00:02:33.194 --> 00:02:35.572 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] To prepare for the
provisional hero licensing exam

00:02:35.655 --> 00:02:39.242 position:50% align:center
coming up, me and my fellow
first years in UA's hero course

00:02:39.325 --> 00:02:41.870 position:50% align:center
are going through
intensive training.

00:02:43.705 --> 00:02:45.874 position:50% align:center
Here's a useful tip
about the big exam.

00:02:45.957 --> 00:02:48.793 position:50% align:center
Most years, you have to rescue
someone from a pretend disaster.

00:02:48.877 --> 00:02:50.378 position:50% align:center
Which can be difficult.

00:02:50.462 --> 00:02:52.839 position:50% align:center
So let's prepare now.

00:02:52.922 --> 00:02:55.425 position:50% align:center
You'll be split into
two teams of ten.

00:02:55.508 --> 00:02:59.929 position:50% align:center
Each group will complete
a training exercise together.

00:03:00.013 --> 00:03:01.890 position:50% align:center
It looks like I'm on Team A.

00:03:01.973 --> 00:03:03.475 position:50% align:center
Iida and Tsu?

00:03:03.558 --> 00:03:05.643 position:50% align:center
We've got this in
the bag. I can't wait!

00:03:05.727 --> 00:03:07.645 position:50% align:center
We'll just have to
do our best, ribbit.

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:09.022 position:50% align:center
We'll kill this thing.

00:03:09.105 --> 00:03:10.398 position:50% align:center
Oh, we're all over it.

00:03:10.482 --> 00:03:12.484 position:50% align:center
Teamwork is always
incredibly important

00:03:12.567 --> 00:03:14.319 position:50% align:center
for our training,
so I'm looking forward

00:03:14.402 --> 00:03:17.238 position:50% align:center
to working with you,
Tokoyami and Todoroki.

00:03:17.322 --> 00:03:18.114 position:50% align:center
Sure.

00:03:18.198 --> 00:03:20.408 position:50% align:center
Together we will prevail.

00:03:20.492 --> 00:03:23.870 position:50% align:center
Ugh. On the same team
as that damn nerd?

00:03:25.538 --> 00:03:27.499 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Rescue training, huh?

00:03:27.582 --> 00:03:30.168 position:50% align:center
I wonder what we'll be doing.

00:03:30.251 --> 00:03:31.294 position:50% align:center
Now, then.

00:03:31.378 --> 00:03:34.005 position:50% align:center
You'll begin the
exercise immediately.

00:03:34.089 --> 00:03:35.965 position:50% align:center
Everyone go change
into your costumes

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:38.301 position:50% align:center
and regroup at Ground Beta.

00:03:40.011 --> 00:03:42.305 position:50% align:center
[TENYA] All right. As your
class representative,

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:45.642 position:50% align:center
I have been designated
as the leader of Team A.

00:03:45.725 --> 00:03:47.977 position:50% align:center
[TENYA] It should be our goal
to complete this rescue mission

00:03:48.061 --> 00:03:51.398 position:50% align:center
swiftly so we don't bring
shame to our school.

00:03:51.481 --> 00:03:52.482 position:50% align:center
We'll need each of you to bring

00:03:52.565 --> 00:03:54.693 position:50% align:center
your absolute best
to this training.

00:03:54.776 --> 00:03:56.736 position:50% align:center
--I will accept no less...
--[KAMINARI] Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:59.406 position:50% align:center
When is he gonna learn to
stop monologuing so much?

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:01.324 position:50% align:center
Come on, let's just
get on with it!

00:04:01.408 --> 00:04:03.785 position:50% align:center
I understand how eager
everyone is to start,

00:04:03.868 --> 00:04:05.995 position:50% align:center
but it's important for us
to carefully analyze

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:08.790 position:50% align:center
the situation at hand.
Then we can plan effectively.

00:04:08.873 --> 00:04:11.793 position:50% align:center
[TENYA]
You see? Yaoyorozu understands.

00:04:13.503 --> 00:04:15.588 position:50% align:center
Two hours ago,
a fire broke out

00:04:15.672 --> 00:04:18.717 position:50% align:center
on the bottom floor of a large
underground shopping mall.

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:20.635 position:50% align:center
Fortunately, the blaze
was extinguished,

00:04:20.719 --> 00:04:23.263 position:50% align:center
and most everyone
present was evacuated.

00:04:23.346 --> 00:04:25.056 position:50% align:center
However, we've received word

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:26.891 position:50% align:center
that somewhere inside
of this building,

00:04:26.975 --> 00:04:30.437 position:50% align:center
there's still one stranded
person who needs our assistance.

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:32.647 position:50% align:center
[TENYA] Our mission is to
rescue that citizen as quickly

00:04:32.731 --> 00:04:34.566 position:50% align:center
and safely as possible.

00:04:34.649 --> 00:04:37.610 position:50% align:center
For our purposes, the "citizen"
will be a training dummy.

00:04:37.694 --> 00:04:39.404 position:50% align:center
[YAOYOROZU] Damage from
the fire has taken out

00:04:39.487 --> 00:04:41.614 position:50% align:center
the underground power
lines, but luckily,

00:04:41.698 --> 00:04:44.117 position:50% align:center
a backup generator is working.

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:45.869 position:50% align:center
That's good. Things
will be a lot easier

00:04:45.952 --> 00:04:47.412 position:50% align:center
if the lights stay on.

00:04:47.495 --> 00:04:50.165 position:50% align:center
This boils down to a race
against the clock.

00:04:50.248 --> 00:04:52.292 position:50% align:center
I propose we split into teams.

00:04:52.375 --> 00:04:53.585 position:50% align:center
Hey, this is weird.

00:04:53.668 --> 00:04:56.254 position:50% align:center
I'm not getting any kinda
phone signal out here.

00:04:56.338 --> 00:04:57.172 position:50% align:center
Me neither.

00:04:57.255 --> 00:04:59.341 position:50% align:center
This thing might
as well be dead.

00:04:59.424 --> 00:05:01.634 position:50% align:center
I'm guessing it's no coincidence
that our most common

00:05:01.718 --> 00:05:04.387 position:50% align:center
form of communication
is out for this exercise.

00:05:04.471 --> 00:05:05.680 position:50% align:center
If that's how it is,

00:05:05.764 --> 00:05:07.390 position:50% align:center
then we'll need
a rendezvous point.

00:05:07.474 --> 00:05:09.768 position:50% align:center
As well as a time
to meet up there.

00:05:09.851 --> 00:05:12.687 position:50% align:center
[TSUYU] This mall has
six underground floors.

00:05:12.771 --> 00:05:14.898 position:50% align:center
What if we go down the
central stairwell and search

00:05:14.981 --> 00:05:16.691 position:50% align:center
the first level, B1, in teams.

00:05:16.775 --> 00:05:19.611 position:50% align:center
We could meet back at the
stairs ten minutes later.

00:05:19.694 --> 00:05:22.322 position:50% align:center
Then continue to sweep each
floor until we find the person

00:05:22.405 --> 00:05:23.740 position:50% align:center
who needs to be rescued.

00:05:23.823 --> 00:05:25.658 position:50% align:center
[OCHACO] Yes! That's
a great idea, Tsu!

00:05:25.742 --> 00:05:27.744 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
I agree.

00:05:27.827 --> 00:05:30.038 position:50% align:center
Hey! Where are
you going, Kacchan?

00:05:30.121 --> 00:05:31.790 position:50% align:center
[KATSUKI]
Where do you think?

00:05:31.873 --> 00:05:33.708 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna track down
this stupid citizen

00:05:33.792 --> 00:05:35.251 position:50% align:center
who didn't escape in time.

00:05:35.335 --> 00:05:37.087 position:50% align:center
[TENYA]
Wait a minute, Bakugo!

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:39.631 position:50% align:center
Going off on your own ruins
our cooperative efforts!

00:05:39.714 --> 00:05:41.675 position:50% align:center
We should do as Asui proposes!

00:05:41.758 --> 00:05:43.551 position:50% align:center
I told you to call me "Tsu"!

00:05:43.635 --> 00:05:46.596 position:50% align:center
[TENYA]
Uh-- Yes. As Tsu suggests.

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:48.390 position:50% align:center
[KATSUKI] You idiots are
the ones saying the search

00:05:48.473 --> 00:05:51.434 position:50% align:center
is a race against time.
I'll find this dummy

00:05:51.518 --> 00:05:53.687 position:50% align:center
while you're still trying
to figure out what to do.

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:56.356 position:50% align:center
That's the real difference
between you and me.

00:05:56.439 --> 00:05:57.482 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
No! Don't!

00:05:57.565 --> 00:05:58.942 position:50% align:center
[KIRISHIMA]
Yeah! Wait up, man.

00:05:59.025 --> 00:06:00.819 position:50% align:center
It's dangerous to go
alone. I'll join you.

00:06:00.902 --> 00:06:02.821 position:50% align:center
[KAMINARI] Yeah, I guess
we better go with him.

00:06:02.904 --> 00:06:05.198 position:50% align:center
You guys. We need
some kind of plan.

00:06:05.281 --> 00:06:08.576 position:50% align:center
We're good. Just meet us
at the stairs in ten.

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:10.328 position:50% align:center
We'll make sure
Bakugo's with us.

00:06:10.412 --> 00:06:11.454 position:50% align:center
Probably.

00:06:11.538 --> 00:06:14.457 position:50% align:center
Right. Sure. Okay.
Be careful in there.

00:06:14.541 --> 00:06:16.835 position:50% align:center
Wow, Bakugo never
changes, does he?

00:06:16.918 --> 00:06:18.545 position:50% align:center
So self-centered.

00:06:18.628 --> 00:06:20.171 position:50% align:center
[TENYA]
Um. Anyway.

00:06:20.255 --> 00:06:21.840 position:50% align:center
The clock is still ticking.

00:06:21.923 --> 00:06:24.050 position:50% align:center
Let's split up and begin
our searches as well.

00:06:24.134 --> 00:06:25.510 position:50% align:center
[YAOYOROZU] I've been
thinking about what Quirks

00:06:25.593 --> 00:06:27.220 position:50% align:center
will complement each other.

00:06:27.303 --> 00:06:30.181 position:50% align:center
We can group Midoriya,
Uraraka, and Asui.

00:06:30.265 --> 00:06:32.434 position:50% align:center
And Todoroki with Tokoyami.

00:06:32.517 --> 00:06:34.144 position:50% align:center
If everyone agrees with that,

00:06:34.227 --> 00:06:37.105 position:50% align:center
then Iida and I will
make up the final pairing.

00:06:37.188 --> 00:06:38.648 position:50% align:center
I see. That's smart.

00:06:38.732 --> 00:06:42.068 position:50% align:center
Each group is well-balanced
based on what our Quirks can do.

00:06:42.152 --> 00:06:44.029 position:50% align:center
Asui will be able to
navigate any terrain

00:06:44.112 --> 00:06:45.697 position:50% align:center
we might end up facing.

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:48.199 position:50% align:center
Uraraka's Zero Gravity
will be useful.

00:06:48.283 --> 00:06:49.951 position:50% align:center
And I'll provide power.

00:06:50.994 --> 00:06:52.370 position:50% align:center
With the three of us,

00:06:52.454 --> 00:06:54.247 position:50% align:center
we could rescue someone
even if they were stuck

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:55.999 position:50% align:center
under a mountain of debris.

00:06:56.082 --> 00:06:58.043 position:50% align:center
Which might end up
being the case.

00:06:58.126 --> 00:07:00.003 position:50% align:center
Likewise, Iida's got
speed and Yaoyorozu

00:07:00.086 --> 00:07:03.506 position:50% align:center
has her versatile
Creation Quirk.

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:04.799 position:50% align:center
With their brains and abilities,

00:07:04.883 --> 00:07:06.801 position:50% align:center
I have no doubt those two
will solve any problem

00:07:06.885 --> 00:07:08.887 position:50% align:center
they might run into underground.

00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:13.183 position:50% align:center
And then there's the team
of Todoroki and Tokoyami.

00:07:13.266 --> 00:07:15.143 position:50% align:center
Dark Shadow's search
capabilities and strength

00:07:15.226 --> 00:07:16.770 position:50% align:center
are perfect for this,

00:07:16.853 --> 00:07:19.397 position:50% align:center
while Todoroki's Half-Cold,
Half-Hot will be extremely handy

00:07:19.481 --> 00:07:22.942 position:50% align:center
in a disaster area.

00:07:23.026 --> 00:07:24.694 position:50% align:center
Plus, Dark Shadow's
major weak point

00:07:24.778 --> 00:07:26.488 position:50% align:center
is that it's hard to
control in the dark.

00:07:26.571 --> 00:07:29.199 position:50% align:center
But the light from flames
will keep him at bay.

00:07:29.282 --> 00:07:32.702 position:50% align:center
I can't believe she figured
all this out so quickly.

00:07:32.786 --> 00:07:34.871 position:50% align:center
The only problem I can
see is the with us...

00:07:34.954 --> 00:07:37.332 position:50% align:center
If the emergency power cuts out
and everything goes black,

00:07:37.415 --> 00:07:38.958 position:50% align:center
our group will be in the dark.

00:07:39.042 --> 00:07:40.585 position:50% align:center
None of the three of us
can produce light,

00:07:40.669 --> 00:07:41.544 position:50% align:center
but maybe if we were to...

00:07:41.628 --> 00:07:43.088 position:50% align:center
[OCHACO]
Deku, you're rambling.

00:07:43.171 --> 00:07:43.963 position:50% align:center
Hey, Deku!

00:07:44.047 --> 00:07:46.716 position:50% align:center
Ah! Where's everybody else?

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:47.759 position:50% align:center
[OCHACO]
They left already.

00:07:47.842 --> 00:07:48.843 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Huh?

00:07:48.927 --> 00:07:50.887 position:50% align:center
[TSUYU]
We should start searching, too.

00:07:50.970 --> 00:07:51.971 position:50% align:center
Don't ya think?

00:07:52.055 --> 00:07:53.348 position:50% align:center
Oh. Yeah, of course!

00:07:53.431 --> 00:07:55.809 position:50% align:center
Let's get this citizen
rescued quickly!

00:07:59.312 --> 00:08:01.272 position:50% align:center
[OCHACO]
This place is huge.

00:08:01.356 --> 00:08:02.440 position:50% align:center
--[TSUYU] Yeah.
--[IZUKU] Yeah.

00:08:02.524 --> 00:08:04.442 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] And it's brighter
than I expected.

00:08:04.526 --> 00:08:06.653 position:50% align:center
We shouldn't have any
problems searching like this.

00:08:06.736 --> 00:08:08.780 position:50% align:center
Okay, but where do
we start looking?

00:08:08.863 --> 00:08:11.866 position:50% align:center
The fire started on the
bottom floor of the mall.

00:08:11.950 --> 00:08:13.910 position:50% align:center
That means the person we
need to rescue probably

00:08:13.993 --> 00:08:16.454 position:50% align:center
tried to head up to the
surface when they saw smoke.

00:08:16.538 --> 00:08:17.789 position:50% align:center
Since they didn't make it out,

00:08:17.872 --> 00:08:19.416 position:50% align:center
there's a possibility that
they're trapped somehow.

00:08:19.499 --> 00:08:22.502 position:50% align:center
Maybe stuck behind
some fire shutters.

00:08:22.585 --> 00:08:25.296 position:50% align:center
We should focus on places
close to the stairs.

00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:26.214 position:50% align:center
[OCHACO]
Right!

00:08:26.297 --> 00:08:27.716 position:50% align:center
[TSUYU]
Ribbit.

00:08:29.676 --> 00:08:31.720 position:50% align:center
[TENYA] I don't see any
trace in this section.

00:08:31.803 --> 00:08:35.557 position:50% align:center
We should keep looking until
our allotted time is up.

00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:38.810 position:50% align:center
[TODOROKI] Tokoyami? Will this
be bright enough for you?

00:08:38.893 --> 00:08:41.354 position:50% align:center
[TOKOYAMI] I'm controlling
Dark Shadow comfortably.

00:08:42.397 --> 00:08:43.690 position:50% align:center
[KAMINARI]
Hey, slow down.

00:08:43.773 --> 00:08:45.233 position:50% align:center
It's like you're
trying to lose us.

00:08:45.316 --> 00:08:48.069 position:50% align:center
I didn't tell you
guys to follow me!

00:08:52.032 --> 00:08:53.867 position:50% align:center
[OCHACO] Every shop
down here is shuttered.

00:08:53.950 --> 00:08:56.244 position:50% align:center
It's like we're
navigating a maze.

00:08:56.327 --> 00:08:57.495 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
The stairs should be...

00:08:57.579 --> 00:08:58.955 position:50% align:center
--[IZUKU, OCHACO grunt]
--[TSUYU] Ribbit?

00:08:59.039 --> 00:09:00.415 position:50% align:center
What's that?

00:09:00.498 --> 00:09:01.499 position:50% align:center
[TENYA]
Not good!

00:09:01.583 --> 00:09:02.876 position:50% align:center
Is that an earthquake?

00:09:02.959 --> 00:09:04.377 position:50% align:center
Why's it shaking?! Make it stop!

00:09:04.461 --> 00:09:07.130 position:50% align:center
Get your hands offa me, dammit!

00:09:07.213 --> 00:09:08.548 position:50% align:center
[KIRISHIMA]
The floor!

00:09:09.924 --> 00:09:11.634 position:50% align:center
The power!

00:09:11.718 --> 00:09:12.677 position:50% align:center
[TSUYU]
Ribbit!

00:09:12.761 --> 00:09:13.887 position:50% align:center
--[IZUKU] Asui!
--[OCHACO] Tsu, no!

00:09:14.888 --> 00:09:17.307 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
One For All, Full Cowling...

00:09:19.142 --> 00:09:20.643 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Shoot Style!

00:09:24.022 --> 00:09:25.273 position:50% align:center
Uh-oh!

00:09:25.357 --> 00:09:26.358 position:50% align:center
Deku!

00:09:43.208 --> 00:09:45.752 position:50% align:center
[OCHACO]
Deku! Wake up!

00:09:51.257 --> 00:09:52.801 position:50% align:center
Uh? Am I floating? Or...

00:09:52.884 --> 00:09:55.053 position:50% align:center
Are you okay?
Not hurt, are you?

00:09:55.136 --> 00:09:59.140 position:50% align:center
Uh, no. I think
I'm fine. Thanks.

00:09:59.224 --> 00:10:01.601 position:50% align:center
If you hadn't saved me,
this would have been bad.

00:10:01.685 --> 00:10:02.852 position:50% align:center
[OCHACO]
It was nothing.

00:10:02.936 --> 00:10:05.647 position:50% align:center
Oh! I'll release you now.

00:10:07.899 --> 00:10:09.192 position:50% align:center
[OCHACO]
Whoa!

00:10:11.903 --> 00:10:14.030 position:50% align:center
So, uh. What floor is this?

00:10:14.114 --> 00:10:15.990 position:50% align:center
I don't know how far we dropped.

00:10:16.074 --> 00:10:17.575 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Yeah, me neither.

00:10:17.659 --> 00:10:19.828 position:50% align:center
We should figure out where we
are before we do anything else.

00:10:19.911 --> 00:10:22.205 position:50% align:center
Wait. Hold on,
where'd Asui go?

00:10:22.288 --> 00:10:23.832 position:50% align:center
Call me "Tsu." Please.

00:10:23.915 --> 00:10:27.002 position:50% align:center
[yelps]

00:10:27.085 --> 00:10:29.838 position:50% align:center
[OCHACO] Oh, I'm so glad
you're all right!

00:10:29.921 --> 00:10:32.799 position:50% align:center
Thanks. But this isn't
going very well for us.

00:10:32.882 --> 00:10:34.843 position:50% align:center
There's mounds of
debris everywhere.

00:10:34.926 --> 00:10:37.554 position:50% align:center
I don't see any way for
us to get out of here.

00:10:37.637 --> 00:10:39.848 position:50% align:center
Even the ceiling is blocked.

00:10:39.931 --> 00:10:42.976 position:50% align:center
You're right. We need
to find another exit.

00:10:43.059 --> 00:10:44.978 position:50% align:center
I know! Why don't you
use your super strength

00:10:45.061 --> 00:10:47.480 position:50% align:center
to blast the cement out
of the way in one punch?

00:10:47.564 --> 00:10:49.733 position:50% align:center
That's not a good idea, Ochaco.

00:10:49.816 --> 00:10:51.359 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Oh. It isn't?

00:10:51.443 --> 00:10:54.362 position:50% align:center
If you listen carefully,
you'll hear why.

00:10:55.655 --> 00:10:59.159 position:50% align:center
[rattling, rumbling]

00:10:59.242 --> 00:11:00.535 position:50% align:center
What is it?

00:11:00.618 --> 00:11:02.495 position:50% align:center
The building's unstable.

00:11:02.579 --> 00:11:04.622 position:50% align:center
There must be more parts
of the ceiling crumbling

00:11:04.706 --> 00:11:05.749 position:50% align:center
throughout the mall.

00:11:05.832 --> 00:11:07.709 position:50% align:center
Yes. Which means,
if we're not careful

00:11:07.792 --> 00:11:10.045 position:50% align:center
clearing a path, we could
cause the whole structure

00:11:10.128 --> 00:11:11.421 position:50% align:center
to collapse on us.

00:11:11.504 --> 00:11:13.548 position:50% align:center
In that case, we'll
have to move the rubble

00:11:13.631 --> 00:11:15.550 position:50% align:center
out of the way
one piece at a time.

00:11:15.633 --> 00:11:18.553 position:50% align:center
If we use your Zero Gravity,
it shouldn't take us too long!

00:11:18.636 --> 00:11:20.847 position:50% align:center
[OCHACO]
Right. Leave it to me.

00:11:20.930 --> 00:11:23.350 position:50% align:center
[YAOYOROZU muffled]
Hello?

00:11:23.433 --> 00:11:25.101 position:50% align:center
Can anybody hear me?

00:11:25.185 --> 00:11:27.562 position:50% align:center
[OCHACO]
Deku. That sounds like...

00:11:27.645 --> 00:11:29.647 position:50% align:center
Yaoyorozu's voice!

00:11:29.731 --> 00:11:32.692 position:50% align:center
[YAOYOROZU]
Hello? Is anyone down here?

00:11:32.776 --> 00:11:34.819 position:50% align:center
Please! Iida's been injured!

00:11:34.903 --> 00:11:36.571 position:50% align:center
Iida's hurt?

00:11:36.654 --> 00:11:38.156 position:50% align:center
I think it's coming
from that way!

00:11:38.239 --> 00:11:40.575 position:50% align:center
Yaoyorozu! It's Midoriya!

00:11:40.658 --> 00:11:43.578 position:50% align:center
Uraraka and Asui--
I mean, Tsu, are here, too!

00:11:43.661 --> 00:11:45.830 position:50% align:center
Stay put! We're
heading your way now!

00:11:45.914 --> 00:11:48.833 position:50% align:center
[YAOYOROZU]
Midoriya! Please hurry!

00:11:48.917 --> 00:11:50.460 position:50% align:center
You should cover
the ceiling in glue

00:11:50.543 --> 00:11:52.796 position:50% align:center
to keep any of it from
falling on you two.

00:11:52.879 --> 00:11:54.798 position:50% align:center
[YAOYOROZU]
Yes! I will.

00:11:57.759 --> 00:11:59.177 position:50% align:center
[TODOROKI]
It's been about ten minutes

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:02.389 position:50% align:center
since the shaking stopped,
and there were no aftershocks.

00:12:02.472 --> 00:12:03.890 position:50% align:center
It wasn't an earthquake.

00:12:03.973 --> 00:12:06.393 position:50% align:center
Instead, I'm guessing that
the mall's structural integrity

00:12:06.476 --> 00:12:08.436 position:50% align:center
has been compromised.

00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:11.690 position:50% align:center
Thank you... for earlier.

00:12:11.773 --> 00:12:14.859 position:50% align:center
If you hadn't created
a sheet of ice over my head,

00:12:14.943 --> 00:12:17.362 position:50% align:center
I would be buried
under debris right now.

00:12:17.445 --> 00:12:18.863 position:50% align:center
That's what friends
are for, right?

00:12:18.947 --> 00:12:20.657 position:50% align:center
Don't worry about it.

00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:23.827 position:50% align:center
Still, though. It'll be hard
to escape without light.

00:12:23.910 --> 00:12:26.204 position:50% align:center
Yes. And obviously, Dark Shadow

00:12:26.287 --> 00:12:28.498 position:50% align:center
is difficult to handle
in these conditions.

00:12:28.581 --> 00:12:30.583 position:50% align:center
I might lose all control.

00:12:30.667 --> 00:12:32.002 position:50% align:center
Which would cause
more of the building

00:12:32.085 --> 00:12:33.378 position:50% align:center
to collapse. Got it.

00:12:33.461 --> 00:12:36.589 position:50% align:center
I could use my Quirk if
you made continuous flames.

00:12:36.673 --> 00:12:38.341 position:50% align:center
That would weaken me.

00:12:38.425 --> 00:12:41.678 position:50% align:center
I'd rather not. If I
start a fire and there's

00:12:41.761 --> 00:12:45.056 position:50% align:center
no airflow from outside,
it could use up all our oxygen.

00:12:45.140 --> 00:12:47.350 position:50% align:center
We could get carbon
monoxide poisoning.

00:12:47.434 --> 00:12:49.060 position:50% align:center
Unless it's
absolutely necessary,

00:12:49.144 --> 00:12:52.689 position:50% align:center
we should avoid
fire at all costs.

00:12:52.772 --> 00:12:54.024 position:50% align:center
There's no way we can continue

00:12:54.107 --> 00:12:57.569 position:50% align:center
the training exercise now.
The teachers will come.

00:12:57.652 --> 00:13:00.321 position:50% align:center
If we remain calm,
then we should be fine.

00:13:00.405 --> 00:13:03.575 position:50% align:center
Maybe. That's the
likeliest scenario.

00:13:03.658 --> 00:13:06.036 position:50% align:center
But there's also the
possibility that this collapse

00:13:06.119 --> 00:13:09.456 position:50% align:center
was part of the training
exercise from the beginning.

00:13:09.539 --> 00:13:12.208 position:50% align:center
Escaping a secondary
disaster, huh?

00:13:12.292 --> 00:13:13.418 position:50% align:center
Whatever the case may be,

00:13:13.501 --> 00:13:15.253 position:50% align:center
I'm worried about
our classmates.

00:13:15.337 --> 00:13:16.588 position:50% align:center
We didn't get hurt.

00:13:16.671 --> 00:13:19.716 position:50% align:center
But that shaking
was intense, so...

00:13:19.799 --> 00:13:22.052 position:50% align:center
We need to make sure
everybody's okay.

00:13:22.135 --> 00:13:26.556 position:50% align:center
Agreed. Their safety
should be our new priority.

00:13:31.227 --> 00:13:34.439 position:50% align:center
Aw, man. Being
buried is terrible!

00:13:34.522 --> 00:13:37.359 position:50% align:center
Hey! Kaminari, you still alive?

00:13:37.442 --> 00:13:39.861 position:50% align:center
Uh, I think so?

00:13:41.363 --> 00:13:44.407 position:50% align:center
[KIRISHIMA] Gah, Bakugo
was amazing back there.

00:13:44.491 --> 00:13:47.160 position:50% align:center
If he hadn't blasted the
ceiling as it was falling,

00:13:47.243 --> 00:13:49.204 position:50% align:center
breaking it up into tiny pieces,

00:13:49.287 --> 00:13:51.664 position:50% align:center
things coulda been a lot
more painful for us.

00:13:51.748 --> 00:13:53.625 position:50% align:center
Take some credit, too, man.

00:13:53.708 --> 00:13:55.627 position:50% align:center
You're the one who used your
Hardening to protect me

00:13:55.710 --> 00:13:59.005 position:50% align:center
from the shards that
flew out of the explosion.

00:13:59.089 --> 00:14:00.298 position:50% align:center
If you think about it,

00:14:00.382 --> 00:14:02.217 position:50% align:center
I'm the only one who
hasn't helped anybody yet.

00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:03.093 position:50% align:center
I'm just dead weight.

00:14:03.176 --> 00:14:04.844 position:50% align:center
Aw, don't be hard on yourself.

00:14:04.928 --> 00:14:07.555 position:50% align:center
[KATSUKI]
Huh! Could you be stupider?

00:14:07.639 --> 00:14:09.099 position:50% align:center
[KIRISHIMA]
Bakugo!

00:14:09.182 --> 00:14:10.600 position:50% align:center
[KAMINARI] Aw, hey, you don't
have to say that to my face.

00:14:10.684 --> 00:14:12.560 position:50% align:center
Gimme a break. I know I'm not
the smartest kid in class,

00:14:12.644 --> 00:14:13.561 position:50% align:center
but come on!

00:14:13.645 --> 00:14:15.480 position:50% align:center
Shut up, you moron.

00:14:15.563 --> 00:14:17.148 position:50% align:center
[KAMINARI]
You said it again!

00:14:17.232 --> 00:14:18.525 position:50% align:center
[KATSUKI]
Listen!

00:14:18.608 --> 00:14:21.194 position:50% align:center
Your power's the one we
need most from here on out!

00:14:21.277 --> 00:14:23.571 position:50% align:center
You don't even know
that, Sparkplug?

00:14:23.655 --> 00:14:25.532 position:50% align:center
Think for once.

00:14:25.615 --> 00:14:27.158 position:50% align:center
You mean it?

00:14:27.242 --> 00:14:29.661 position:50% align:center
Don't use your Quirk
until I tell you to.

00:14:29.744 --> 00:14:31.162 position:50% align:center
Okay, so what do we do now?

00:14:31.246 --> 00:14:32.622 position:50% align:center
It's sorta obvious, isn't it?

00:14:32.706 --> 00:14:34.582 position:50% align:center
We gotta find a way
to get outta this place.

00:14:34.666 --> 00:14:37.127 position:50% align:center
We should forget about that
dummy and save ourselves.

00:14:37.210 --> 00:14:38.753 position:50% align:center
We're kinda the ones
who need to be rescued

00:14:38.837 --> 00:14:40.255 position:50% align:center
at this point, ya know?

00:14:40.338 --> 00:14:41.381 position:50% align:center
The teachers have to know

00:14:41.464 --> 00:14:43.383 position:50% align:center
what's going on down
here, don't they?

00:14:43.466 --> 00:14:46.511 position:50% align:center
Which means they'll come
save us if we just hang tight.

00:14:46.594 --> 00:14:48.013 position:50% align:center
I hope so.

00:14:48.096 --> 00:14:50.056 position:50% align:center
Plus, if we're not careful,
we could cause more damage.

00:14:50.140 --> 00:14:52.517 position:50% align:center
That'd be bad. Uh--
Where're you going?

00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:53.685 position:50% align:center
[KATSUKI]
Where do you think?

00:14:53.768 --> 00:14:55.061 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna track down
this stupid citizen

00:14:55.145 --> 00:14:56.479 position:50% align:center
who didn't escape in time.

00:14:56.563 --> 00:14:58.148 position:50% align:center
Hey, wait up!
This is just training.

00:14:58.231 --> 00:14:59.691 position:50% align:center
There's not a real person.

00:14:59.774 --> 00:15:02.610 position:50% align:center
Don't risk our lives to prove
you can save some doll.

00:15:02.694 --> 00:15:04.487 position:50% align:center
We should stay here and
wait for help to show up.

00:15:04.571 --> 00:15:06.489 position:50% align:center
All Might would keep searching.

00:15:06.573 --> 00:15:08.283 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:15:08.366 --> 00:15:10.577 position:50% align:center
[KATSUKI] I don't care
if it's training or not.

00:15:10.660 --> 00:15:13.830 position:50% align:center
All Might would save the
person who needed help.

00:15:13.913 --> 00:15:16.082 position:50% align:center
If the number-one hero
would keep on fighting,

00:15:16.166 --> 00:15:18.251 position:50% align:center
then I'm gonna do
the same thing.

00:15:18.335 --> 00:15:20.378 position:50% align:center
I don't need anyone
to come save me.

00:15:20.462 --> 00:15:22.672 position:50% align:center
I'll do the rescuing myself.

00:15:22.756 --> 00:15:24.299 position:50% align:center
Hey. Wait a sec.

00:15:24.382 --> 00:15:25.842 position:50% align:center
You're getting way
too worked up.

00:15:25.925 --> 00:15:27.594 position:50% align:center
Don't worry, man,
I got your back.

00:15:27.677 --> 00:15:28.678 position:50% align:center
Not you, too!

00:15:28.762 --> 00:15:30.138 position:50% align:center
He makes sense.

00:15:30.221 --> 00:15:31.806 position:50% align:center
Once we get our
provisional licenses,

00:15:31.890 --> 00:15:34.225 position:50% align:center
we'll be doing real hero work
on the streets, right?

00:15:34.309 --> 00:15:35.643 position:50% align:center
And when that happens,
we might end up

00:15:35.727 --> 00:15:37.979 position:50% align:center
in tough situations
like this one.

00:15:38.063 --> 00:15:39.898 position:50% align:center
Would a pro leave someone
who needs rescuing

00:15:39.981 --> 00:15:43.360 position:50% align:center
and run away to save himself?
That's not very manly.

00:15:43.443 --> 00:15:46.821 position:50% align:center
Crimson Riot would
never be such a coward!

00:15:46.905 --> 00:15:48.698 position:50% align:center
So that's why
I'm going with you.

00:15:48.782 --> 00:15:51.659 position:50% align:center
Okay, now <i>you're</i> getting
way too worked up.

00:15:51.743 --> 00:15:52.786 position:50% align:center
Let's do this.

00:15:52.869 --> 00:15:54.746 position:50% align:center
Just don't get in
my way, Spikey Hair!

00:15:54.829 --> 00:15:57.665 position:50% align:center
Yeah. You got it.
Just lead the way.

00:15:57.749 --> 00:16:01.544 position:50% align:center
Seriously? Did you both
get hit in the head earlier?

00:16:01.628 --> 00:16:03.963 position:50% align:center
Wait for me! I'm coming, too!

00:16:04.047 --> 00:16:07.092 position:50% align:center
I don't wanna be
left alone down here!

00:16:18.103 --> 00:16:19.646 position:50% align:center
Thank goodness!

00:16:22.065 --> 00:16:23.358 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Poor Iida.

00:16:23.441 --> 00:16:25.777 position:50% align:center
[YAOYOROZU]
It happened so fast.

00:16:25.860 --> 00:16:27.028 position:50% align:center
[YAOYOROZU gasps]

00:16:27.112 --> 00:16:28.238 position:50% align:center
[TENYA]
Watch out!

00:16:28.321 --> 00:16:29.531 position:50% align:center
[YAOYOROZU yelps]

00:16:35.412 --> 00:16:37.872 position:50% align:center
[YAOYOROZU] He injured
his leg protecting me.

00:16:37.956 --> 00:16:41.459 position:50% align:center
Then took a hit to the head.

00:16:41.543 --> 00:16:44.671 position:50% align:center
I feel bad. But his
condition seems stable.

00:16:44.754 --> 00:16:48.133 position:50% align:center
And I was at least able to
administer first aid to his leg.

00:16:48.216 --> 00:16:49.551 position:50% align:center
[TENYA grunts]

00:16:49.634 --> 00:16:50.468 position:50% align:center
[OCHACO]
Can you hear us?

00:16:50.552 --> 00:16:52.595 position:50% align:center
[TSUYU]
Hang in there, Iida.

00:16:52.679 --> 00:16:56.433 position:50% align:center
[TENYA] We... We have
to hurry and save...

00:16:57.934 --> 00:16:59.853 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] So like him.
He's still thinking

00:16:59.936 --> 00:17:02.313 position:50% align:center
of the rescue, even in
his delirious state.

00:17:02.397 --> 00:17:04.107 position:50% align:center
We need to get him
somewhere safe,

00:17:04.190 --> 00:17:05.608 position:50% align:center
as quickly as we can.

00:17:05.692 --> 00:17:07.569 position:50% align:center
How when we're trapped in here?

00:17:07.652 --> 00:17:08.862 position:50% align:center
It would take hours to move

00:17:08.945 --> 00:17:10.989 position:50% align:center
each piece of
debris individually.

00:17:11.072 --> 00:17:13.491 position:50% align:center
We're so far away
from the surface.

00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:17.454 position:50% align:center
There are elevators
in the building though!

00:17:20.123 --> 00:17:24.169 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] If the elevator
shafts didn't cave in,

00:17:24.252 --> 00:17:25.712 position:50% align:center
we can use Uraraka's Quirk

00:17:25.795 --> 00:17:27.964 position:50% align:center
to float straight up
to the first floor.

00:17:30.508 --> 00:17:32.218 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
This isn't training anymore.

00:17:32.302 --> 00:17:33.970 position:50% align:center
It's a real rescue.

00:17:34.054 --> 00:17:35.930 position:50% align:center
We're getting Iida out
no matter what!

00:17:36.014 --> 00:17:36.931 position:50% align:center
--[YAOYOROZU, OCHACO] Yeah!
--[TSUYU] Ribbit!

00:17:37.015 --> 00:17:38.725 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
We'll definitely save him.

00:17:38.808 --> 00:17:40.268 position:50% align:center
We have to!

00:17:52.322 --> 00:17:55.033 position:50% align:center
[KIRISHIMA] This is the
bottom floor of the mall.

00:17:55.116 --> 00:17:56.951 position:50% align:center
Level B6.

00:17:57.035 --> 00:17:58.870 position:50% align:center
[KAMINARI]
Aw, dude, what a mess.

00:17:58.953 --> 00:18:00.205 position:50% align:center
How are we supposed
to find someone

00:18:00.288 --> 00:18:02.290 position:50% align:center
with all this crap
on the ground?

00:18:02.374 --> 00:18:03.500 position:50% align:center
[KATSUKI]
Find the area that doesn't look

00:18:03.583 --> 00:18:05.043 position:50% align:center
like it's taken damage.

00:18:05.126 --> 00:18:06.252 position:50% align:center
[KIRISHIMA]
I dunno why that matters,

00:18:06.336 --> 00:18:09.089 position:50% align:center
but that spot over there
looks pretty clear.

00:18:09.172 --> 00:18:11.758 position:50% align:center
The walls are still
intact, at least.

00:18:11.841 --> 00:18:13.385 position:50% align:center
[KATSUKI]
Then, let's go!

00:18:13.468 --> 00:18:14.761 position:50% align:center
--[KIRISHIMA] Okay!
--[KAMINARI] How come?

00:18:14.844 --> 00:18:15.970 position:50% align:center
Why there?

00:18:16.054 --> 00:18:18.348 position:50% align:center
You moron. Anyone with
a brain would guess

00:18:18.431 --> 00:18:21.351 position:50% align:center
the most fortified place is
where the emergency power supply

00:18:21.434 --> 00:18:23.019 position:50% align:center
should be located.

00:18:26.439 --> 00:18:28.233 position:50% align:center
There we go.

00:18:28.316 --> 00:18:30.985 position:50% align:center
Still managed to get
pretty banged up.

00:18:31.069 --> 00:18:33.488 position:50% align:center
Okay, idiot! Time to
make yourself useful.

00:18:33.571 --> 00:18:35.323 position:50% align:center
Uh. Who, me?

00:18:36.574 --> 00:18:38.785 position:50% align:center
Yeah, get over here
and use your electricity

00:18:38.868 --> 00:18:40.745 position:50% align:center
to juice up this power supply.

00:18:40.829 --> 00:18:42.706 position:50% align:center
Uh. Right.

00:18:42.789 --> 00:18:43.998 position:50% align:center
[KAMINARI]
I get it now!

00:18:44.082 --> 00:18:46.001 position:50% align:center
Bakugo wants to fix
the emergency power

00:18:46.084 --> 00:18:49.087 position:50% align:center
to make it easier for the rest
of our classmates to escape.

00:18:49.170 --> 00:18:52.382 position:50% align:center
Quit dragging your feet,
or I'll freaking murder you.

00:18:52.465 --> 00:18:56.761 position:50% align:center
[KAMINARI] Okay, okay.
If that's all I gotta do,

00:18:56.845 --> 00:18:58.555 position:50% align:center
then this is a piece of cake.

00:18:58.638 --> 00:19:00.473 position:50% align:center
Stand back, you guys.

00:19:00.557 --> 00:19:01.558 position:50% align:center
Take this!

00:19:01.641 --> 00:19:03.852 position:50% align:center
All-Out Shock
2,000,000 Volts--

00:19:03.935 --> 00:19:07.689 position:50% align:center
The battery is gonna break
if you put in that much power!

00:19:07.772 --> 00:19:10.442 position:50% align:center
[KAMINARI]
Cool. Yeah. Lemme try again.

00:19:10.525 --> 00:19:14.320 position:50% align:center
[KAMINARI] Okay, let's do
this thing. Rapid charging!

00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:21.578 position:50% align:center
That should be enough.

00:19:21.661 --> 00:19:22.954 position:50% align:center
I hope so.

00:19:24.789 --> 00:19:26.041 position:50% align:center
We're getting close.

00:19:26.124 --> 00:19:28.626 position:50% align:center
We should be at the elevators
soon at this rate.

00:19:28.710 --> 00:19:31.629 position:50% align:center
Uraraka, are you all right?
Are you feeling sick?

00:19:31.713 --> 00:19:33.715 position:50% align:center
[grunts] I'll be fine, honest.

00:19:33.798 --> 00:19:36.134 position:50% align:center
The important thing
is that we save Iida.

00:19:36.217 --> 00:19:37.844 position:50% align:center
Besides, if this
is too much for me,

00:19:37.927 --> 00:19:40.263 position:50% align:center
I definitely won't pass
the licensing exam.

00:19:40.347 --> 00:19:44.017 position:50% align:center
I know you can do this,
Ochaco. Hang in there, 'kay?

00:19:44.100 --> 00:19:45.185 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I can.

00:19:45.268 --> 00:19:48.480 position:50% align:center
Just go Plus Ultra
and push through.

00:19:51.316 --> 00:19:54.611 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] A little farther.
We're so close.

00:19:57.447 --> 00:19:59.616 position:50% align:center
[TODOROKI] If only Uraraka
or Yaoyorozu were here,

00:19:59.699 --> 00:20:01.368 position:50% align:center
this would be easy.

00:20:01.451 --> 00:20:03.661 position:50% align:center
[TOKOYAMI]
If only we had some light.

00:20:03.745 --> 00:20:04.913 position:50% align:center
Well, we can't
do anything about

00:20:04.996 --> 00:20:06.289 position:50% align:center
what we don't have.

00:20:06.373 --> 00:20:07.374 position:50% align:center
Push.

00:20:09.334 --> 00:20:10.377 position:50% align:center
[TODOROKI]
Oh, no!

00:20:11.878 --> 00:20:12.879 position:50% align:center
Todoroki!

00:20:12.962 --> 00:20:16.466 position:50% align:center
[DARK SHADOW roars]

00:20:19.135 --> 00:20:21.346 position:50% align:center
Calm yourself, Dark Shadow!

00:20:25.350 --> 00:20:26.226 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:20:26.309 --> 00:20:28.061 position:50% align:center
It's shaking again!

00:20:29.354 --> 00:20:30.480 position:50% align:center
[OCHACO]
Deku!

00:20:30.563 --> 00:20:31.981 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
It's now or never!

00:20:32.065 --> 00:20:34.526 position:50% align:center
One For All... Full Cowling!

00:20:36.152 --> 00:20:37.904 position:50% align:center
[DARK SHADOW growling]

00:20:37.987 --> 00:20:39.197 position:50% align:center
Todoroki!

00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:42.242 position:50% align:center
Quiet down, Dark Shadow!

00:20:42.325 --> 00:20:45.036 position:50% align:center
You have to control yourself!

00:20:50.500 --> 00:20:52.252 position:50% align:center
[DARK SHADOW whimpers]

00:20:53.294 --> 00:20:56.715 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU pants]

00:20:56.798 --> 00:20:58.258 position:50% align:center
The lights are back.

00:20:58.341 --> 00:21:00.844 position:50% align:center
Aw, yeah, emergency
power back online!

00:21:00.927 --> 00:21:03.221 position:50% align:center
Now, we just have to
find that stupid dummy!

00:21:03.304 --> 00:21:06.224 position:50% align:center
Yeah! But what about all
that rumbling earlier?

00:21:06.307 --> 00:21:08.935 position:50% align:center
Ignore it! Let's move.

00:21:09.019 --> 00:21:10.103 position:50% align:center
--[KIRISHIMA] Right!
--[KAMINARI] Yay.

00:21:10.186 --> 00:21:12.480 position:50% align:center
Wait for me, you guys.

00:21:12.564 --> 00:21:15.483 position:50% align:center
Hang in there, Todoroki,
you're gonna be okay.

00:21:15.567 --> 00:21:18.319 position:50% align:center
[grunts] I'm sorry.

00:21:18.403 --> 00:21:20.447 position:50% align:center
I think I blacked out
for a bit there.

00:21:20.530 --> 00:21:24.409 position:50% align:center
Dark Shadow went wild.
Please forgive me.

00:21:24.492 --> 00:21:27.495 position:50% align:center
No, there's no
need to apologize.

00:21:27.579 --> 00:21:30.832 position:50% align:center
It worked out in the end.

00:21:30.915 --> 00:21:32.667 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
We thought we were safe.

00:21:32.751 --> 00:21:34.961 position:50% align:center
But our trials
were far from over.

00:21:38.840 --> 00:21:42.594 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] The rescue training for
the provisional licensing exam--

00:21:42.677 --> 00:21:45.180 position:50% align:center
No, the actual test
of whether or not

00:21:45.263 --> 00:21:50.018 position:50% align:center
we could survive
was about to begin.

00:21:50.101 --> 00:21:52.187 position:50% align:center
And we had no idea...
