[IZUKU]
Tell me something.

00:00:14.097 --> 00:00:16.683 position:50% align:center
The tea was part of
your ritual, right?

00:00:18.685 --> 00:00:21.563 position:50% align:center
Well aren't you a
perceptive young man?

00:00:21.646 --> 00:00:23.023 position:50% align:center
My dearest viewers!

00:00:23.106 --> 00:00:26.026 position:50% align:center
I believe it's time to give
you a taste of my hijinks!

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:29.863 position:50% align:center
[GENTLE] Try not to be so
dazzled that you avert your eyes

00:00:29.946 --> 00:00:32.866 position:50% align:center
as your favorite scoundrel
shows off his talents.

00:00:32.949 --> 00:00:35.618 position:50% align:center
Gentle Criminal at your service!

00:00:35.702 --> 00:00:38.121 position:50% align:center
My plans have shifted.

00:00:38.204 --> 00:00:40.206 position:50% align:center
Due to our current
predicament, friends,

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.044 position:50% align:center
I'll keep my words brief.
For this caper,

00:00:44.127 --> 00:00:46.296 position:50% align:center
I will infiltrate UA!

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:47.339 position:50% align:center
So cool!

00:00:47.422 --> 00:00:48.798 position:50% align:center
I won't let you do that!

00:00:48.882 --> 00:00:51.551 position:50% align:center
[GENTLE] Clever boy.
But no such luck for you.

00:00:51.634 --> 00:00:53.636 position:50% align:center
Gently... Trampoline!

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:55.930 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU yelps]

00:00:56.014 --> 00:00:57.098 position:50% align:center
[GENTLE]
I'm sure you have feelings

00:00:57.182 --> 00:00:58.683 position:50% align:center
invested in this festival.

00:00:58.767 --> 00:01:00.393 position:50% align:center
But they can't win
against the desires

00:01:00.477 --> 00:01:02.687 position:50% align:center
of my mustache and my soul!

00:01:02.771 --> 00:01:06.441 position:50% align:center
This scheme is a crucial step
toward my becoming a legend.

00:01:06.524 --> 00:01:09.152 position:50% align:center
Be a dear and
stay out of my way.

00:01:09.235 --> 00:01:10.153 position:50% align:center
Cheerio, lad.

00:01:10.236 --> 00:01:12.781 position:50% align:center
Hope you stick the landing.

00:01:12.864 --> 00:01:15.867 position:50% align:center
I won't let you ruin this
for my entire school!

00:01:19.996 --> 00:01:25.293 position:50% align:center
[GENTLE] For the sake of the
world, for the sake of others,

00:01:25.377 --> 00:01:29.297 position:50% align:center
for the sake of
my courageous dream,

00:01:29.381 --> 00:01:32.592 position:50% align:center
and to honor your
feelings for me...

00:03:13.068 --> 00:03:17.572 position:50% align:center
[MONOMA laughs]

00:03:17.655 --> 00:03:19.991 position:50% align:center
Are you kidding, what the heck
are you wearing, Kendo?

00:03:20.075 --> 00:03:21.826 position:50% align:center
Oh, dang. Lookin' good!

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:22.744 position:50% align:center
This is weird.

00:03:22.827 --> 00:03:24.037 position:50% align:center
Don't just waltz in here.

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:25.497 position:50% align:center
She could have been
getting dressed.

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:26.998 position:50% align:center
This is nuts!

00:03:27.082 --> 00:03:28.750 position:50% align:center
Hard to believe someone who's
sold her soul to violence

00:03:28.833 --> 00:03:30.627 position:50% align:center
can pull off a look like that.

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:33.129 position:50% align:center
I can't figure out if that's
a compliment or an insult.

00:03:33.213 --> 00:03:34.339 position:50% align:center
A compliment!

00:03:34.422 --> 00:03:36.007 position:50% align:center
After all, I'm the
one who entered you

00:03:36.091 --> 00:03:38.301 position:50% align:center
into the beauty pageant
to begin with.

00:03:38.385 --> 00:03:40.470 position:50% align:center
[MONOMA] I figure you're a
shoo-in because of all your fans

00:03:40.553 --> 00:03:41.846 position:50% align:center
from that commercial!

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:44.391 position:50% align:center
If you win, Class B will
be even more "Plus Ultra"

00:03:44.474 --> 00:03:46.267 position:50% align:center
than the losers in Class A.

00:03:46.351 --> 00:03:49.062 position:50% align:center
More importantly, since you've
been focusing on this,

00:03:49.145 --> 00:03:50.563 position:50% align:center
I've been safe
from you! [laughs]

00:03:50.647 --> 00:03:52.482 position:50% align:center
[KENDO sighs]
Well, if I'm going to compete,

00:03:52.565 --> 00:03:54.359 position:50% align:center
I'm at least gonna
aim for the top.

00:03:54.442 --> 00:03:55.860 position:50% align:center
Hey, hey, hold the phone!

00:03:55.944 --> 00:03:58.071 position:50% align:center
It's not fair to say
Kendo will win this.

00:03:58.154 --> 00:03:59.364 position:50% align:center
It's still anyone's game!

00:03:59.447 --> 00:04:01.199 position:50% align:center
Nejire Hado!

00:04:01.282 --> 00:04:03.451 position:50% align:center
This'll be fun. Won't it?

00:04:03.535 --> 00:04:06.454 position:50% align:center
I agree! I'm looking
forward to--

00:04:06.538 --> 00:04:08.498 position:50% align:center
[KENRANZAKI]
Bless your hearts.

00:04:08.581 --> 00:04:13.336 position:50% align:center
How precious you think
either of you stand a chance.

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:15.880 position:50% align:center
Not when I'm graced
with perfect beauty!

00:04:15.964 --> 00:04:17.924 position:50% align:center
See for yourself!

00:04:18.008 --> 00:04:19.884 position:50% align:center
Bibimi Kenranzaki!

00:04:19.968 --> 00:04:23.471 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:04:24.681 --> 00:04:26.725 position:50% align:center
Is this a girl fight, or what?

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:31.980 position:50% align:center
[MIRIO]
We'll be there super soon.

00:04:32.063 --> 00:04:34.232 position:50% align:center
Let's see, Class A's
performance starts at 10AM,

00:04:34.315 --> 00:04:36.943 position:50% align:center
and after that, we'll run
and catch Class B's play.

00:04:37.027 --> 00:04:40.405 position:50% align:center
Then it's chow time
and the beauty pageant.

00:04:40.488 --> 00:04:42.866 position:50% align:center
I bet you're hyped
to see Midoriya, right?

00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:44.409 position:50% align:center
And his dance moves.

00:04:44.492 --> 00:04:45.952 position:50% align:center
[ERI]
Mm-hm!

00:04:47.495 --> 00:04:49.122 position:50% align:center
[POWER LOADER]
Hatsume? You should probably

00:04:49.205 --> 00:04:51.958 position:50% align:center
clean yourself up before
the presentation, too.

00:04:52.042 --> 00:04:55.545 position:50% align:center
What? All this grease is
just proof of my hard work.

00:04:55.628 --> 00:04:57.505 position:50% align:center
[MIDNIGHT]
Good morning, All Might.

00:04:57.589 --> 00:04:59.132 position:50% align:center
Morning!

00:04:59.215 --> 00:05:01.384 position:50% align:center
What do we have here?

00:05:01.468 --> 00:05:04.679 position:50% align:center
Permission to leave
the campus? This morning?

00:05:04.763 --> 00:05:07.182 position:50% align:center
[ALL MIGHT] Yeah, he said there
was something he had to buy

00:05:07.265 --> 00:05:10.477 position:50% align:center
before their concert, so he
headed down the mountain.

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:12.437 position:50% align:center
But we're just about
to kick things off!

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:14.272 position:50% align:center
That's cutting it pretty close.

00:05:14.356 --> 00:05:17.275 position:50% align:center
I hope he's not doing
anything too naughty.

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:29.329 position:50% align:center
I see you in that boy.

00:05:29.412 --> 00:05:32.123 position:50% align:center
Neither of you are
going to give up!

00:05:32.207 --> 00:05:35.460 position:50% align:center
I think it's time.
Let's use my Quirk!

00:05:38.421 --> 00:05:40.298 position:50% align:center
Can't let them get away.

[IZUKU]
His air membranes are invisible

00:05:45.303 --> 00:05:46.930 position:50% align:center
but they're definitely
still around.

00:05:47.013 --> 00:05:49.099 position:50% align:center
[GENTLE] The things I
elasticize return to normal

00:05:49.182 --> 00:05:50.475 position:50% align:center
gradually over time.

[LA BRAVA]
He's on our tail, Gentle!

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:06.366 position:50% align:center
La Brava, if possible,
I'd like to save your Quirk

00:06:06.449 --> 00:06:08.535 position:50% align:center
until the situation
becomes more dire.

00:06:08.618 --> 00:06:09.703 position:50% align:center
[LA BRAVA]
But! At this rate,

00:06:09.786 --> 00:06:11.788 position:50% align:center
it's highly possible
your plan will fail.

00:06:11.871 --> 00:06:13.164 position:50% align:center
[GENTLE]
I'm well aware.

00:06:13.248 --> 00:06:15.792 position:50% align:center
This clever caper is now
a race against the clock.

00:06:18.211 --> 00:06:20.380 position:50% align:center
And he's fast.

00:06:20.463 --> 00:06:22.298 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] Earlier, I was
able to use my air bullets

00:06:22.382 --> 00:06:25.176 position:50% align:center
to knock him off his trajectory.

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.220 position:50% align:center
In order to recover
from that and land,

00:06:27.303 --> 00:06:29.931 position:50% align:center
he put up two of those
bouncy air membranes.

00:06:32.225 --> 00:06:34.102 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
One of them's above this tree!

00:06:36.771 --> 00:06:40.275 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] If I aim just right,
I can use it against him!

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:45.530 position:50% align:center
[groans]

00:06:47.449 --> 00:06:48.867 position:50% align:center
Are you okay?

00:06:51.619 --> 00:06:53.830 position:50% align:center
That's it, I've got you both.

00:06:53.913 --> 00:06:56.291 position:50% align:center
Stop resisting and give up!

[GENTLE grunts]

00:07:02.464 --> 00:07:04.257 position:50% align:center
[LA BRAVA] In the past,
Gentle would've run away

00:07:04.341 --> 00:07:06.551 position:50% align:center
as soon as he was discovered.

00:07:06.634 --> 00:07:09.054 position:50% align:center
I am betting my soul
and my prized mustache

00:07:09.137 --> 00:07:12.640 position:50% align:center
on this audacious
festival scheme!

00:07:12.724 --> 00:07:15.101 position:50% align:center
But his passion
is getting him hurt.

00:07:15.185 --> 00:07:16.936 position:50% align:center
My poor Gentle!

00:07:22.984 --> 00:07:24.110 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT 85A]
Get this.

00:07:24.194 --> 00:07:26.446 position:50% align:center
You know Aiba, that
short girl in Class 3?

00:07:26.529 --> 00:07:29.574 position:50% align:center
I've never even talked to her,
but she sent me a love letter.

00:07:29.657 --> 00:07:31.201 position:50% align:center
What? For real?

00:07:31.284 --> 00:07:32.869 position:50% align:center
It gets worse.

00:07:32.952 --> 00:07:34.788 position:50% align:center
Based on the weird
stuff she knew,

00:07:34.871 --> 00:07:37.332 position:50% align:center
she's been stalking me.
It's so creepy.

00:07:37.415 --> 00:07:39.125 position:50% align:center
[STUDENTS laugh]

00:07:39.209 --> 00:07:41.252 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT 85A]
There were pages and pages.

00:07:41.336 --> 00:07:42.337 position:50% align:center
I've got to show you.

00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:44.506 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT 85B]
Gross. What a psycho.

00:07:44.589 --> 00:07:46.841 position:50% align:center
It's kinda scary.

00:07:46.925 --> 00:07:48.301 position:50% align:center
[LA BRAVA]
In the fall of my very first

00:07:48.385 --> 00:07:49.678 position:50% align:center
year of middle school,

00:07:49.761 --> 00:07:51.554 position:50% align:center
I worked up the courage
to write a love note

00:07:51.638 --> 00:07:54.474 position:50% align:center
to a boy who ended
up mocking me.

00:07:54.557 --> 00:07:57.936 position:50% align:center
After that, I lost faith
in basically everything.

00:07:58.019 --> 00:08:00.605 position:50% align:center
All I did was stare
at my computer.

00:08:00.689 --> 00:08:04.859 position:50% align:center
But even doing that, I could
feel myself falling apart.

00:08:04.943 --> 00:08:07.946 position:50% align:center
Maybe I should just say
goodbye to this life.

00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:11.324 position:50% align:center
[GENTLE]
A good day to you, dear viewers.

00:08:11.408 --> 00:08:16.371 position:50% align:center
Yes! It is I before you.
Gentle Criminal.

00:08:16.454 --> 00:08:18.373 position:50% align:center
Have you lost your passion?

00:08:18.456 --> 00:08:20.750 position:50% align:center
Then please,
put your faith in me!

00:08:20.834 --> 00:08:23.920 position:50% align:center
For I will change
this wretched world!

00:08:25.797 --> 00:08:29.175 position:50% align:center
[LA BRAVA] That's when
I first discovered you.

00:08:29.259 --> 00:08:31.886 position:50% align:center
You brought light
back to my life.

00:08:37.267 --> 00:08:39.561 position:50% align:center
[LA BRAVA] I can't get rid
of these dark circles.

00:08:39.644 --> 00:08:41.980 position:50% align:center
I hope he doesn't
think I'm a weirdo.

00:08:43.732 --> 00:08:46.484 position:50% align:center
[LA BRAVA] I'm sorry.
I hacked into your account

00:08:46.568 --> 00:08:48.403 position:50% align:center
to get your address.

00:08:48.486 --> 00:08:50.905 position:50% align:center
I'm a fan and I
want to help you.

00:08:50.989 --> 00:08:54.451 position:50% align:center
May I please? Gentle?

00:08:58.747 --> 00:09:02.959 position:50% align:center
[LA BRAVA] You took me in
without any reservations.

00:09:03.043 --> 00:09:06.755 position:50% align:center
And, you were so, so kind.

00:09:06.838 --> 00:09:09.758 position:50% align:center
You didn't make
fun of my feelings.

00:09:09.841 --> 00:09:12.135 position:50% align:center
You accepted me wholly.

00:09:19.434 --> 00:09:21.144 position:50% align:center
[LA BRAVA]
We walked together.

00:09:21.227 --> 00:09:24.272 position:50% align:center
Side by side. Hand in hand.

00:09:36.034 --> 00:09:38.411 position:50% align:center
[GENTLE]
Manami Aiba.

00:09:38.495 --> 00:09:41.039 position:50% align:center
I've been thinking
of your codename.

00:09:41.122 --> 00:09:44.751 position:50% align:center
How does "La Brava"
sound to you?

00:09:44.834 --> 00:09:45.960 position:50% align:center
You're the perfect partner,

00:09:46.044 --> 00:09:48.338 position:50% align:center
and your codename
should reflect that!

00:09:55.220 --> 00:09:59.182 position:50% align:center

Gentle. My darling Gentle!

00:10:00.684 --> 00:10:03.770 position:50% align:center
I'll hand you over to the
police as soon as I can.

00:10:03.853 --> 00:10:06.856 position:50% align:center
Don't try to fight back.

00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:10.193 position:50% align:center
I love you, Gentle.

00:10:10.276 --> 00:10:14.489 position:50% align:center
And I you, my La Brava.

00:10:14.572 --> 00:10:19.828 position:50% align:center
[PRESENT MIC]
La Brava. Her Quirk: Love.

00:10:19.911 --> 00:10:21.538 position:50% align:center
By professing her
love to the person

00:10:21.621 --> 00:10:24.624 position:50% align:center
she has feelings for,
she can temporarily power up

00:10:24.708 --> 00:10:28.211 position:50% align:center
the object of her affection.

00:10:28.294 --> 00:10:31.297 position:50% align:center
What's going on? His strength.

00:10:31.381 --> 00:10:32.549 position:50% align:center
[PRESENT MIC]
The deeper her love,

00:10:32.632 --> 00:10:34.384 position:50% align:center
the more of a boost
she can give.

00:10:34.467 --> 00:10:36.386 position:50% align:center
If activated in times of crisis,

00:10:36.469 --> 00:10:39.180 position:50% align:center
she can increase
someone's strength tenfold!

00:10:39.264 --> 00:10:41.808 position:50% align:center
Ah, love. Such a powerful thing!

00:10:43.518 --> 00:10:45.311 position:50% align:center
[GENTLE]
Apologies, lad.

00:10:45.395 --> 00:10:46.396 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU grunts]

00:10:48.356 --> 00:10:51.026 position:50% align:center
[GENTLE]
I abhor using brute force,

00:10:51.109 --> 00:10:54.446 position:50% align:center
so I usually edit out
scenes of such violence.

00:10:56.614 --> 00:10:59.784 position:50% align:center
[GENTLE] It would be best
if you took a nap.

00:10:59.868 --> 00:11:01.119 position:50% align:center
[yelps]

00:11:02.203 --> 00:11:04.414 position:50% align:center
[LA BRAVA]
He really does hate this.

00:11:07.917 --> 00:11:10.503 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
No.

00:11:10.587 --> 00:11:14.758 position:50% align:center
I've fought against stronger,
faster people than you.

00:11:14.841 --> 00:11:16.801 position:50% align:center
And beaten them.

00:11:16.885 --> 00:11:18.386 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:23.058 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] This isn't over.
I haven't lost yet!

00:11:33.151 --> 00:11:36.654 position:50% align:center
[PRESENT MIC]
Good morning, UA!

00:11:36.738 --> 00:11:37.906 position:50% align:center
Yeah!

00:11:37.989 --> 00:11:40.367 position:50% align:center
Prep work is all done
and it's time to rock!

00:11:40.450 --> 00:11:41.951 position:50% align:center
Let's get this party goin'!

00:11:42.035 --> 00:11:45.372 position:50% align:center
If you can hear my voice,
get out there and have fun!

00:11:45.455 --> 00:11:48.541 position:50% align:center
Let me hear you
make some noise!

00:11:49.668 --> 00:11:54.130 position:50% align:center line:10%
[PRESENT MIC] The UA School
Festival starts now!

00:11:54.964 --> 00:11:56.383 position:50% align:center
[GENTLE grunts]

00:11:56.466 --> 00:11:57.967 position:50% align:center
[GENTLE]
This is impossible.

00:11:58.051 --> 00:11:59.010 position:50% align:center
No way!

00:11:59.094 --> 00:12:01.096 position:50% align:center
[GENTLE]
That was our last resort!

00:12:01.179 --> 00:12:05.809 position:50% align:center
In the past, Lover Mode
always allowed us to escape.

00:12:05.892 --> 00:12:07.268 position:50% align:center
Together!

00:12:07.352 --> 00:12:09.646 position:50% align:center
Why won't you just
give up already?

00:12:09.729 --> 00:12:13.441 position:50% align:center
[LA BRAVA]
Gentle! No. I'm sorry!

00:12:13.525 --> 00:12:14.859 position:50% align:center
Forgive me, but...

00:12:14.943 --> 00:12:18.863 position:50% align:center
It seems like my love wasn't
strong enough to help!

00:12:18.947 --> 00:12:20.907 position:50% align:center
Nothing's certain yet, La Brava.

00:12:20.990 --> 00:12:23.201 position:50% align:center
Your feelings will
see us through.

00:12:24.244 --> 00:12:26.246 position:50% align:center
[GENTLE]
Gently Sandwich!

00:12:27.747 --> 00:12:28.873 position:50% align:center
[GENTLE]
The thinner the sandwich,

00:12:28.957 --> 00:12:31.209 position:50% align:center
the more elegant
it's considered.

00:12:31.292 --> 00:12:33.586 position:50% align:center
I do regret having to
pile on so many layers,

00:12:33.670 --> 00:12:36.172 position:50% align:center
but I suppose it
can't be helped.

00:12:36.256 --> 00:12:38.258 position:50% align:center
Sacrifices must be made

00:12:38.341 --> 00:12:41.678 position:50% align:center
to achieve the dreams
of my youth.

00:12:41.761 --> 00:12:45.765 position:50% align:center
To make certain
history remembers me.

00:12:45.849 --> 00:12:49.352 position:50% align:center
This is no longer an ambition
I hold simply for myself!

00:12:49.436 --> 00:12:52.647 position:50% align:center
Unless I want my name
to fade, I must persevere.

00:12:52.731 --> 00:12:55.358 position:50% align:center
My aims are not so trivial
I would abandon them

00:12:55.442 --> 00:12:57.444 position:50% align:center
only because you asked.

00:12:57.527 --> 00:13:00.530 position:50% align:center
You're a UA student,
so you must understand

00:13:00.613 --> 00:13:03.742 position:50% align:center
what it means
to yearn for a goal.

00:13:05.452 --> 00:13:07.704 position:50% align:center
I do. If you understand <i>that</i> ,

00:13:07.787 --> 00:13:10.248 position:50% align:center
then why would you target
the school festival?

00:13:10.331 --> 00:13:14.336 position:50% align:center
Why would you ruin everything
we've worked so hard for?

00:13:14.419 --> 00:13:18.506 position:50% align:center
Because. There's no other way.

00:13:18.590 --> 00:13:21.926 position:50% align:center
It's for your dream.
So nothing else matters?

00:13:22.010 --> 00:13:24.220 position:50% align:center
You'll get the
whole event canceled.

00:13:24.304 --> 00:13:25.972 position:50% align:center
And take the happiness
away from a girl

00:13:26.056 --> 00:13:28.475 position:50% align:center
who doesn't even
know how to smile yet!

00:13:30.518 --> 00:13:34.814 position:50% align:center
[GENTLE] I will. If that's what
it takes to achieve my goal.

00:13:35.899 --> 00:13:39.527 position:50% align:center
[GENTLE]
My dream is to become a pro.

00:13:39.611 --> 00:13:41.279 position:50% align:center
A hero great enough
to be written about

00:13:41.363 --> 00:13:42.822 position:50% align:center
in textbooks one day.

00:13:42.906 --> 00:13:44.949 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Let's talk about that.

00:13:45.033 --> 00:13:47.535 position:50% align:center
Things aren't looking
good for you, Tobita.

00:13:47.619 --> 00:13:49.371 position:50% align:center
Our school isn't
exactly difficult,

00:13:49.454 --> 00:13:52.624 position:50% align:center
yet your grades are horrible
and you keep getting held back.

00:13:52.707 --> 00:13:54.209 position:50% align:center
On top of that,
this is the fourth time

00:13:54.292 --> 00:13:56.336 position:50% align:center
you've failed the
provisional licensing exam.

00:13:56.419 --> 00:13:58.046 position:50% align:center
Honestly, the only
thing I can recommend

00:13:58.129 --> 00:14:02.300 position:50% align:center
is for you to
voluntarily withdraw.

00:14:02.384 --> 00:14:04.135 position:50% align:center
[TOBITA'S MOM] I heard
the Takeshitas' son already

00:14:04.219 --> 00:14:06.846 position:50% align:center
has agencies asking him to join.

00:14:06.930 --> 00:14:08.807 position:50% align:center
Don't worry about it, Mom.

00:14:08.890 --> 00:14:11.726 position:50% align:center
I'll keep trying. I swear.

00:14:13.561 --> 00:14:16.856 position:50% align:center
Emergency! Call a hero!

He's gonna fall!

00:14:20.568 --> 00:14:22.570 position:50% align:center
[GENTLE]
I thought that, with my Quirk.

00:14:22.654 --> 00:14:26.366 position:50% align:center
I could make a cushion.
I could save him.

It'll be a long recovery.

00:14:44.217 --> 00:14:47.804 position:50% align:center
Your actions interfered
with a pro's rescue attempt.

00:14:47.887 --> 00:14:49.222 position:50% align:center
I have to charge you
with obstructing

official hero duties.

00:14:51.141 --> 00:14:53.393 position:50% align:center

00:15:10.493 --> 00:15:12.954 position:50% align:center
[GENTLE] I had already
abandoned my dream.

And then...

00:15:14.164 --> 00:15:17.250 position:50% align:center
Takeshita? You formed
your own agency?

That's wonderful!

00:15:18.710 --> 00:15:20.462 position:50% align:center
You must remember
me from school?

00:15:20.545 --> 00:15:22.422 position:50% align:center
We were in the same class--

00:15:22.505 --> 00:15:26.426 position:50% align:center
Uh, sure. What was
your name again?

00:15:27.886 --> 00:15:32.515 position:50% align:center
[GENTLE] That's when I knew.
I'd been forgotten.

00:15:34.934 --> 00:15:37.687 position:50% align:center
[GENTLE] Would I simply
grow old and die alone?

00:15:37.771 --> 00:15:40.357 position:50% align:center
Poor and pathetic?

00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:44.194 position:50% align:center
No! Never!

00:15:44.277 --> 00:15:45.904 position:50% align:center
I have time!

[LA BRAVA]
Gentle!

00:15:49.366 --> 00:15:51.910 position:50% align:center
[LA BRAVA] We use Lover Mode
as a way to escape in a hurry.

00:15:51.993 --> 00:15:54.162 position:50% align:center
Not like this.

00:15:54.245 --> 00:15:58.041 position:50% align:center
He usually tries so hard
to avoid violence.

00:15:58.124 --> 00:16:01.836 position:50% align:center
[GENTLE] You can mock me
and say that I'm weak!

00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:04.339 position:50% align:center

I'm the same as you, Gentle.

My dream isn't just
my own anymore!

00:16:51.052 --> 00:16:54.055 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] I have a goal that
my body wasn't made for.

00:16:54.139 --> 00:16:57.434 position:50% align:center
And there was a point when
I'd completely given up on it.

00:16:57.517 --> 00:16:59.978 position:50% align:center
But for everyone
who's cheered me on.

00:17:00.061 --> 00:17:02.856 position:50% align:center
For everyone who's
acknowledged me!

00:17:02.939 --> 00:17:05.233 position:50% align:center
I'll become a hero.

00:17:05.316 --> 00:17:08.194 position:50% align:center
Plenty of people in
this world are hurting.

00:17:08.278 --> 00:17:10.447 position:50% align:center
And so...

00:17:10.530 --> 00:17:11.823 position:50% align:center
I want to become someone

00:17:11.906 --> 00:17:14.284 position:50% align:center
who can show them
a bright future!

00:17:16.870 --> 00:17:20.165 position:50% align:center

you can do this!

If I can connect to
UA's internal network

using this special
wireless connection,

00:17:36.389 --> 00:17:38.016 position:50% align:center
then I can deactivate
their security system,

00:17:38.099 --> 00:17:39.726 position:50% align:center
and we can get inside.

00:17:39.809 --> 00:17:42.437 position:50% align:center
This program I
created has to work!

00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:46.107 position:50% align:center
Oh, no. I can't connect
from this far away.

00:17:48.818 --> 00:17:50.487 position:50% align:center

Do you still believe me
to be an unworthy opponent?

00:18:10.382 --> 00:18:12.884 position:50% align:center
[GENTLE] I will throw
away my pride, honor,

00:19:12.652 --> 00:19:15.405 position:50% align:center
[PRESENT MIC] The power up from
La Brava's Quirk is temporary.

00:19:15.488 --> 00:19:18.324 position:50% align:center
And can only be used
once per day.

00:19:20.326 --> 00:19:24.039 position:50% align:center
[LA BRAVA] No. Stop.
Take your hands off of him.

00:19:24.122 --> 00:19:29.044 position:50% align:center
Let my Gentle go!
Get off him! Now!

00:19:29.127 --> 00:19:32.255 position:50% align:center
Gentle poured his whole
heart into this scheme!

00:19:32.339 --> 00:19:34.924 position:50% align:center
He even forgot to take
his beloved tea breaks

00:19:35.008 --> 00:19:36.551 position:50% align:center
while he worked.

00:19:36.634 --> 00:19:39.679 position:50% align:center
You want to show the
world a bright future?

00:19:39.763 --> 00:19:42.849 position:50% align:center
Can't you see Gentle
is my only light!

00:19:42.932 --> 00:19:47.145 position:50% align:center
Don't take my him from me!
Please, I'll have nothing left.

00:19:50.398 --> 00:19:52.859 position:50% align:center
[GENTLE]
La Brava.

00:19:52.942 --> 00:19:56.946 position:50% align:center
I told you to run knowing
full well that you wouldn't.

00:19:57.030 --> 00:20:00.533 position:50% align:center
Because that is who you are.

00:20:02.577 --> 00:20:04.871 position:50% align:center
[GENTLE]
You can't help me.

00:20:04.954 --> 00:20:07.665 position:50% align:center
That would make you an
accomplice to my misdeeds.

00:20:07.749 --> 00:20:09.584 position:50% align:center
Yes, but I've
already committed

00:20:09.668 --> 00:20:12.712 position:50% align:center
plenty of crimes
with my hacking.

00:20:14.381 --> 00:20:16.174 position:50% align:center
It'll be fine, Gentle!

00:20:16.257 --> 00:20:18.677 position:50% align:center
It's all worth it
to be with you.

00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:22.138 position:50% align:center
As long as I'm by your
side, I'll be happy.

00:20:22.222 --> 00:20:25.850 position:50% align:center
[GENTLE] Would you have found
joy if you'd escaped alone?

00:20:25.934 --> 00:20:28.144 position:50% align:center
Would you have found a new life?

00:20:29.896 --> 00:20:31.064 position:50% align:center
[GENTLE]
No.

00:20:31.147 --> 00:20:34.234 position:50% align:center
I'll die before I'll let
anyone take you from me!

00:20:34.317 --> 00:20:36.486 position:50% align:center
[GENTLE] I'm sure you would've
gone on to commit crimes

00:20:36.569 --> 00:20:41.658 position:50% align:center
far more heinous than we have.

00:20:41.741 --> 00:20:43.535 position:50% align:center
But this is my fault.

00:20:43.618 --> 00:20:45.537 position:50% align:center
I'm the one who
brought you here,

00:20:45.620 --> 00:20:48.498 position:50% align:center
who accepted you and
made you my partner.

00:20:48.581 --> 00:20:50.375 position:50% align:center
Who got you involved.

00:20:52.085 --> 00:20:53.670 position:50% align:center
[GENTLE]
La Brava.

00:20:53.753 --> 00:20:58.466 position:50% align:center
I hope you know that
I am happy with you!

00:21:01.219 --> 00:21:03.847 position:50% align:center
[GENTLE] If the heroes
catch me like this,

00:21:03.930 --> 00:21:08.059 position:50% align:center
it'll be obvious that
you are my accomplice.

00:21:08.143 --> 00:21:09.769 position:50% align:center
In which case...

00:21:12.272 --> 00:21:14.065 position:50% align:center
[GENTLE] The least I can do
is make it look as though

00:21:14.149 --> 00:21:16.151 position:50% align:center
this fight never happened.

00:21:16.234 --> 00:21:19.446 position:50% align:center
To make the crime just
a little less serious.

00:21:22.949 --> 00:21:25.785 position:50% align:center
[GENTLE]
Don't come back, Izuku Midoriya.

00:21:26.870 --> 00:21:29.748 position:50% align:center
[GENTLE] For the sake of
my darling's future.

00:21:33.543 --> 00:21:35.420 position:50% align:center
[GENTLE]
Such a passionate young boy.

00:21:35.503 --> 00:21:37.130 position:50% align:center
You should be proud.

00:21:37.213 --> 00:21:41.676 position:50% align:center
You protected everything
you stood for and won.

00:21:46.014 --> 00:21:49.225 position:50% align:center
[GENTLE] I'm afraid I took
a tumble in the park.

00:21:51.311 --> 00:21:56.399 position:50% align:center
UA, I'm turning myself in.

00:23:29.492 --> 00:23:31.119 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Here's the preview!

00:23:31.202 --> 00:23:33.955 position:50% align:center
Gentle's dreams.
La Brava's feelings.

00:23:34.039 --> 00:23:37.125 position:50% align:center
The two of them always
put each other first.

00:23:37.208 --> 00:23:40.045 position:50% align:center
With this bittersweet victory
still lingering on my mind,

00:23:40.128 --> 00:23:44.007 position:50% align:center
I run at full speed toward UA
where my friends are waiting.

00:23:44.090 --> 00:23:45.884 position:50% align:center
Because I want
to see them smiling.

00:23:45.967 --> 00:23:50.096 position:50% align:center
Especially Eri! Now,
we've got a show to do!

00:23:50.180 --> 00:23:53.141 position:50% align:center
Next time: "Let It Flow!
School Festival!"

00:23:53.224 --> 00:23:55.393 position:50% align:center
I hope we can make
everyone happy.

00:23:55.477 --> 00:23:57.937 position:50% align:center
Go beyond! Plus Ultra!
