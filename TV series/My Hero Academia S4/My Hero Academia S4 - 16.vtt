As I recovered from the raid,

00:00:12.637 --> 00:00:14.222 position:50% align:center
Kacchan and Todoroki
continued their

00:00:14.305 --> 00:00:16.474 position:50% align:center
provisional license training.

00:00:16.558 --> 00:00:17.434 position:50% align:center
[YOARASHI]
Oh!

00:00:17.517 --> 00:00:21.146 position:50% align:center
Hey! It's UA!

00:00:22.147 --> 00:00:26.317 position:50% align:center
[CAMIE] Ooh! Who's this
smoldery-looking two-toned boy?

00:00:26.401 --> 00:00:27.944 position:50% align:center
You're, like, super hot.

00:00:28.028 --> 00:00:31.114 position:50% align:center
I'm crazy psyched to train
with a total babe like you.

00:00:31.197 --> 00:00:33.283 position:50% align:center
Camie, this is beneath you!

00:00:33.366 --> 00:00:34.659 position:50% align:center
As a Shiketsu student,

00:00:34.743 --> 00:00:36.703 position:50% align:center
you mustn't fraternize
with such failures.

00:00:36.786 --> 00:00:39.080 position:50% align:center
Hold on! You failed the
first test we took, loser.

00:00:39.164 --> 00:00:40.623 position:50% align:center
I received permission
to observe,

00:00:40.707 --> 00:00:41.583 position:50% align:center
so I'm here to judge you!

00:00:41.666 --> 00:00:42.709 position:50% align:center
Stupid meat, you're dead!

00:00:42.792 --> 00:00:44.794 position:50% align:center
My name's Seiji Shishikura!

00:00:44.878 --> 00:00:47.088 position:50% align:center
[MERA]
It's about time we got started.

00:00:47.172 --> 00:00:48.882 position:50% align:center
[GANG ORCA]
Yes.

00:00:48.965 --> 00:00:51.051 position:50% align:center
[MERA]
Shall we make today's training

00:00:51.134 --> 00:00:53.595 position:50% align:center
a little bit more interesting?

00:02:28.106 --> 00:02:29.524 position:50% align:center
[YOARASHI]
Hey, Todoroki.

00:02:29.607 --> 00:02:31.359 position:50% align:center
What kinda food do you like?

00:02:31.443 --> 00:02:32.986 position:50% align:center
Soba. Cold.

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:35.905 position:50% align:center
Man. I like my
noodles pipin' hot!

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:37.365 position:50% align:center
And I prefer udon.

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:38.867 position:50% align:center
We're very different.

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:41.494 position:50% align:center
[YOARASHI] No way! I feel
like we've gotten closer!

00:02:41.578 --> 00:02:43.163 position:50% align:center
[TODOROKI]
I've told you this before,

00:02:43.246 --> 00:02:45.415 position:50% align:center
you don't have to try
to force us to be friends.

00:02:45.498 --> 00:02:47.083 position:50% align:center
[YOARASHI]
Ah--!

00:02:47.167 --> 00:02:49.419 position:50% align:center
That guy's ridiculous.

00:02:51.671 --> 00:02:54.549 position:50% align:center
[MERA] So, we rented out this
sports center in order

00:02:54.632 --> 00:02:58.595 position:50% align:center
to put you through some
specialized training. [yawns]

00:02:58.678 --> 00:03:00.388 position:50% align:center
Sorry 'bout that,
I've actually been afraid

00:03:00.472 --> 00:03:02.182 position:50% align:center
of falling asleep recently.

00:03:02.265 --> 00:03:07.187 position:50% align:center
I'm Mera. Today will
be fun. [laughs]

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:09.564 position:50% align:center
[TRAINEES]
That doesn't sound good.

00:03:09.647 --> 00:03:12.359 position:50% align:center
[MERA] Oh, one more
thing before we begin.

00:03:12.442 --> 00:03:14.027 position:50% align:center
Up until now,
we've had ten people

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:16.154 position:50% align:center
in this remedial training class.

00:03:16.237 --> 00:03:19.199 position:50% align:center
But starting today,
we'll have 11.

00:03:19.282 --> 00:03:22.035 position:50% align:center
Let's snag some seats
up front. Get a better view.

00:03:22.118 --> 00:03:24.579 position:50% align:center
Maybe it'd be smarter
if we stayed in the back.

00:03:24.662 --> 00:03:27.290 position:50% align:center
I don't wanna distract them.

00:03:27.374 --> 00:03:29.334 position:50% align:center
[inhales]

00:03:29.417 --> 00:03:32.253 position:50% align:center
Shoto!

00:03:32.337 --> 00:03:33.963 position:50% align:center
You never should've
failed the initial exam

00:03:34.047 --> 00:03:35.256 position:50% align:center
in the first place!

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:36.508 position:50% align:center
Show these weaklings
that you're

00:03:36.591 --> 00:03:38.009 position:50% align:center
in a completely
different league!

00:03:38.093 --> 00:03:39.344 position:50% align:center
[TRAINEE 79AA]
What? No way.

00:03:39.427 --> 00:03:41.554 position:50% align:center
[TRAINEE 79A] It's Endeavor!
The number-two hero!

00:03:41.638 --> 00:03:44.015 position:50% align:center
Or, wait. He's the
number-one hero now.

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:47.310 position:50% align:center
Seriously? That's kinda random.

00:03:47.394 --> 00:03:49.312 position:50% align:center
Why's he here?

00:03:51.356 --> 00:03:54.984 position:50% align:center
[ENDEAVOR]
Move it. You're in my way.

00:03:56.486 --> 00:03:58.071 position:50% align:center
Wait a minute!

00:03:58.154 --> 00:04:00.031 position:50% align:center
Look who's standing next to him!

00:04:00.115 --> 00:04:01.574 position:50% align:center
Are you guys seeing this?

00:04:01.658 --> 00:04:03.660 position:50% align:center
Whoa! All Might!

00:04:03.743 --> 00:04:05.954 position:50% align:center
So much for keeping
a low profile.

00:04:06.037 --> 00:04:07.330 position:50% align:center
They came to watch us?

00:04:07.414 --> 00:04:08.373 position:50% align:center
So cool!

00:04:08.456 --> 00:04:09.791 position:50% align:center
[TRAINEE 79B]
This is nuts.

00:04:09.874 --> 00:04:12.210 position:50% align:center
[TRAINEE 79A] Well, he is
a teacher at UA right now.

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:16.798 position:50% align:center
Yeah, if everyone
could just calm down.

00:04:16.881 --> 00:04:18.717 position:50% align:center
I wasn't finished.

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:21.094 position:50% align:center
This girl will be
joining us from now on.

00:04:21.177 --> 00:04:23.221 position:50% align:center
Hey, second year at Shiketsu.

00:04:23.304 --> 00:04:25.390 position:50% align:center
The name is Camie. Hi, everyone!

00:04:25.473 --> 00:04:29.394 position:50% align:center
Right, so like the rest of you,
she made it to the second exam.

00:04:29.477 --> 00:04:32.480 position:50% align:center
And she did well enough to take
this supplemental class.

00:04:32.564 --> 00:04:34.983 position:50% align:center
But some foggy memories
leading up to the first test

00:04:35.066 --> 00:04:36.735 position:50% align:center
made it difficult to place her.

00:04:36.818 --> 00:04:39.988 position:50% align:center
That's why she hasn't
participated until now.

00:04:40.071 --> 00:04:42.115 position:50% align:center
They said "totes" to
making an exception for me

00:04:42.198 --> 00:04:43.700 position:50% align:center
which is so wicked
coolio, you know?

00:04:43.783 --> 00:04:45.994 position:50% align:center
So anywhos, let's keep it fresh!

00:04:46.077 --> 00:04:48.788 position:50% align:center
[TRAINEES] I have no idea
what she just said.

00:04:48.872 --> 00:04:51.291 position:50% align:center
Camie's idiocy knows no limits.

00:04:51.374 --> 00:04:53.168 position:50% align:center
Let's just call her upbeat.

00:04:53.251 --> 00:04:54.544 position:50% align:center
Just think about it.

00:04:54.627 --> 00:04:57.213 position:50% align:center
Her flighty personality made
her the perfect target.

00:04:57.297 --> 00:05:00.091 position:50% align:center
She didn't even understand
that something had gone wrong.

00:05:00.175 --> 00:05:01.217 position:50% align:center
I failed the test?

00:05:01.301 --> 00:05:03.303 position:50% align:center
I don't even remember
taking a test.

00:05:03.386 --> 00:05:05.930 position:50% align:center
And you're saying I slept
for four whole days?

00:05:06.014 --> 00:05:08.475 position:50% align:center
Ohmygosh, so embarrassing.

00:05:08.558 --> 00:05:10.185 position:50% align:center
People did report
she was speaking

00:05:10.268 --> 00:05:12.771 position:50% align:center
and acting in
uncharacteristic ways.

00:05:12.854 --> 00:05:15.273 position:50% align:center
And we found anesthetics
in her blood, too.

00:05:15.357 --> 00:05:16.858 position:50% align:center
But the reports
from the yakuza raid

00:05:16.941 --> 00:05:19.194 position:50% align:center
are what really put
things into perspective.

00:05:19.277 --> 00:05:22.364 position:50% align:center
I can't believe someone
impersonated her.

00:05:22.447 --> 00:05:24.282 position:50% align:center
The League of Villains.

00:05:24.366 --> 00:05:27.494 position:50% align:center
To think I didn't notice my
classmate was replaced.

00:05:27.577 --> 00:05:30.747 position:50% align:center
I am nothing but
a pathetic fool.

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:32.499 position:50% align:center
Well, it's not like
the heroes or police

00:05:32.582 --> 00:05:35.001 position:50% align:center
realized what was
going on, either.

00:05:35.085 --> 00:05:37.337 position:50% align:center
We need a new Symbol of Peace.

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:40.173 position:50% align:center
Before things get
even more dangerous.

00:05:42.634 --> 00:05:46.513 position:50% align:center
[MERA] Right, then. Let's
bring in your instructor.

00:05:49.557 --> 00:05:51.184 position:50% align:center
[MERA]
Gang Orca.

00:05:51.267 --> 00:05:54.479 position:50% align:center
[GANG ORCA] So, I've got even
more disappointments today.

00:05:54.562 --> 00:05:57.482 position:50% align:center
What shame you must feel
to be standing before me.

00:05:57.565 --> 00:06:00.110 position:50% align:center
Given how easy the exam was.

00:06:02.654 --> 00:06:04.114 position:50% align:center
[SHISHIKURA]
About time he showed.

00:06:04.197 --> 00:06:06.658 position:50% align:center
Those failures were
looking too relaxed.

00:06:06.741 --> 00:06:08.201 position:50% align:center
[SHIKETSU TEACHER 57A]
Did he forget he bombed

00:06:08.284 --> 00:06:11.788 position:50% align:center
the first exam or is he just
pretending it never happened?

00:06:11.871 --> 00:06:13.289 position:50% align:center
[GANG ORCA] There's something
I've realized while

00:06:13.373 --> 00:06:16.584 position:50% align:center
observing your
training thus far.

00:06:16.668 --> 00:06:18.586 position:50% align:center
There's nothing heroic
about any of you!

00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:21.881 position:50% align:center
You're bottom feeders!
Nothing but rotten fish turds!

00:06:21.965 --> 00:06:23.091 position:50% align:center
[TRAINEES]
Sir, yes, sir!

00:06:23.174 --> 00:06:24.342 position:50% align:center
[GANG ORCA]
I can't hear you.

00:06:24.426 --> 00:06:25.719 position:50% align:center
[TRAINEES]
Sir, yes, sir!

00:06:25.802 --> 00:06:27.554 position:50% align:center
[PRESENT MIC]
Dang is he scary.

00:06:27.637 --> 00:06:29.139 position:50% align:center
[GANG ORCA]
Especially you!

00:06:29.222 --> 00:06:31.182 position:50% align:center
Do you even want to be a hero?

00:06:31.266 --> 00:06:33.184 position:50% align:center
Well, first of all,
I'm not a fish turd.

00:06:33.268 --> 00:06:34.561 position:50% align:center
[GANG ORCA]
Wrong!

00:06:34.644 --> 00:06:37.897 position:50% align:center
How can a pile of excrement
help humanity prosper?

00:06:37.981 --> 00:06:39.941 position:50% align:center
Technically fertilizer
is integral to--

00:06:40.025 --> 00:06:41.234 position:50% align:center
[GANG ORCA]
Wrong!

00:06:41.317 --> 00:06:42.944 position:50% align:center
[GANG ORCA]
Do you expect to be praised

00:06:43.028 --> 00:06:45.113 position:50% align:center
just because you have
powerful attacks?

00:06:45.196 --> 00:06:46.322 position:50% align:center
Sir, yes--

00:06:46.406 --> 00:06:48.992 position:50% align:center
[GANG ORCA]
Wrong!

00:06:49.075 --> 00:06:50.910 position:50% align:center
I am well aware that
the three of you

00:06:50.994 --> 00:06:53.747 position:50% align:center
have impressive
combat abilities.

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:55.665 position:50% align:center
But that's all you have.

00:06:55.749 --> 00:06:57.751 position:50% align:center
Your behavior is unacceptable.

00:06:57.834 --> 00:06:59.919 position:50% align:center
You're disrespectful to
those in need of rescue

00:07:00.003 --> 00:07:03.757 position:50% align:center
and ignore your enemies
to compete with one another.

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:06.634 position:50% align:center
Today, we will put you
through a special trial.

00:07:06.718 --> 00:07:08.845 position:50% align:center
It's time you start
training a new muscle.

00:07:08.928 --> 00:07:10.889 position:50% align:center
The one that beats
in your chest!

00:07:10.972 --> 00:07:13.141 position:50% align:center
If you hold out a hand
as someone in trouble,

00:07:13.224 --> 00:07:16.019 position:50% align:center
will they take it?
Not as you are now!

00:07:16.102 --> 00:07:19.439 position:50% align:center
It's fine to have fangs,
but when a life is on the line.

00:07:19.522 --> 00:07:21.649 position:50% align:center
You must have trust!

00:07:23.109 --> 00:07:24.444 position:50% align:center
[GANG ORCA]
You need a special connection

00:07:24.527 --> 00:07:26.613 position:50% align:center
with the person you're
trying to rescue.

00:07:26.696 --> 00:07:28.865 position:50% align:center
Remember that as
you train today.

00:07:28.948 --> 00:07:31.076 position:50% align:center
Now, meet your opponents!

00:07:31.159 --> 00:07:32.577 position:50% align:center
Through this
life-or-death battle,

00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:35.997 position:50% align:center
show that you can come to
an understanding with them!

00:07:36.081 --> 00:07:38.166 position:50% align:center
That's the hurdle you face!

00:07:38.249 --> 00:07:41.127 position:50% align:center

to try to listen and behave!

Don't worry.

We're taking responsibility
for your students now.

00:08:07.487 --> 00:08:08.905 position:50% align:center

help, Mr. Orca.

00:08:08.988 --> 00:08:09.989 position:50% align:center

What do those kiddos need?

00:12:42.804 --> 00:12:44.431 position:50% align:center
So much.

00:12:46.182 --> 00:12:48.268 position:50% align:center
These early elementary
school years

00:12:48.351 --> 00:12:51.688 position:50% align:center
are an important time for
character development.

00:12:51.771 --> 00:12:53.857 position:50% align:center
Because the difference
between children's Quirks

00:12:53.940 --> 00:12:56.234 position:50% align:center
has a huge effect
on their self-esteem,

00:12:56.317 --> 00:12:58.069 position:50% align:center
we offer counseling
in order to support

00:12:58.153 --> 00:13:00.030 position:50% align:center
healthy emotional growth.

00:13:00.113 --> 00:13:02.991 position:50% align:center

is not a cure-all.

00:13:03.074 --> 00:13:05.076 position:50% align:center
The students in this

00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:07.620 position:50% align:center
closed their hearts to us.

I understand that this
is my responsibility.

00:13:10.957 --> 00:13:12.083 position:50% align:center
But, still,

00:13:12.167 --> 00:13:13.918 position:50% align:center
I hope meeting heroes

down a more respectable path.

00:13:23.011 --> 00:13:25.680 position:50% align:center
There's no time for us
to bicker with each other.

00:13:25.764 --> 00:13:26.890 position:50% align:center
We have to save them.

00:13:26.973 --> 00:13:28.183 position:50% align:center
In other words,

00:13:45.533 --> 00:13:47.410 position:50% align:center
The stupid teacher
didn't fulfill her role

00:13:47.494 --> 00:13:50.413 position:50% align:center
as a leader, so the brats ended
up taking over the class.

00:13:50.497 --> 00:13:52.624 position:50% align:center
This isn't something
that just happens.

If they're not listening to her,

00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:56.461 position:50% align:center
then somebody else
must be in charge here.

00:13:56.544 --> 00:13:58.463 position:50% align:center

out who it is.

And then?

00:14:04.678 --> 00:14:06.388 position:50% align:center
[KATSUKI] We beat 'em up
and hang 'em from a post

00:14:06.471 --> 00:14:08.014 position:50% align:center
to make an example
out of the punk.

00:14:08.098 --> 00:14:09.974 position:50% align:center
Then we make the kids
throw rocks at 'em.

00:14:10.058 --> 00:14:11.810 position:50% align:center
It'll be the most
effective way to make them

00:14:11.893 --> 00:14:14.729 position:50% align:center
realize what an insignificant
pest their leader is!

00:14:14.813 --> 00:14:17.232 position:50% align:center

00:15:03.695 --> 00:15:05.822 position:50% align:center
might be something
Inasa excels at.

00:15:05.905 --> 00:15:08.783 position:50% align:center
His passion always cheers
up those around him.

00:15:08.867 --> 00:15:10.910 position:50% align:center
Perhaps he'll pull this off.

00:15:10.994 --> 00:15:13.038 position:50% align:center
[SHIKETSU TEACHER 57A] He's
started a running commentary.

00:15:13.121 --> 00:15:15.582 position:50% align:center
Present Mic must've
rubbed off on him.

00:15:15.665 --> 00:15:18.168 position:50% align:center
That's great!
I wanna be one, too!

00:15:18.251 --> 00:15:21.504 position:50% align:center
Doesn't heroic passion make your
blood bubble with excitement?

00:15:21.588 --> 00:15:22.589 position:50% align:center
[PRESENT MIC]
Kinda weird phrasing,

00:15:22.672 --> 00:15:25.425 position:50% align:center
but it looks like
this might work!

00:15:25.508 --> 00:15:28.261 position:50% align:center
It's the job of a hero to
make sure everyone smiles.

00:15:28.345 --> 00:15:30.055 position:50% align:center
Think if you cause
your teacher trouble,

00:15:30.138 --> 00:15:32.265 position:50% align:center
you're likely to
become good heroes?

00:15:32.349 --> 00:15:33.433 position:50% align:center
[BOY 79G]
I guess not?

00:15:33.516 --> 00:15:35.268 position:50% align:center
Right. So then...

00:15:35.352 --> 00:15:36.728 position:50% align:center
[BOY 79G]
But wait.

00:15:36.811 --> 00:15:38.313 position:50% align:center
That means...

00:15:38.396 --> 00:15:40.648 position:50% align:center
Since you gave the teachers
and the commission guys

00:15:40.732 --> 00:15:42.609 position:50% align:center
more work by making
them do this class,

00:15:42.692 --> 00:15:46.738 position:50% align:center
you can't become one
either. Is that right?

00:15:46.821 --> 00:15:48.865 position:50% align:center
[YOARASHI]
That's true!

00:15:52.369 --> 00:15:54.913 position:50% align:center
[YOARASHI] I'm in no position
to act so high and mighty!

00:15:54.996 --> 00:15:56.873 position:50% align:center
Please forgive me.

00:15:56.956 --> 00:15:59.250 position:50% align:center
[PRESENT MIC] This dope's
got a big heart, huh?

00:15:59.334 --> 00:16:01.878 position:50% align:center
Is it just me or are these
kids like super twisted?

00:16:01.961 --> 00:16:03.213 position:50% align:center
Yeah, exactly!

00:16:03.296 --> 00:16:05.632 position:50% align:center
So a little violence
is necessary!

00:16:05.715 --> 00:16:07.550 position:50% align:center
Bakugo. They're just kids.

00:16:07.634 --> 00:16:09.928 position:50% align:center
Huh? Well, that's how I
was raised and look!

00:16:10.011 --> 00:16:11.471 position:50% align:center
I turned out awesome.

00:16:11.554 --> 00:16:15.225 position:50% align:center
[TODOROKI] No. I think
I might have a better way.

00:16:15.308 --> 00:16:18.853 position:50% align:center
Oh? Why don't you show us
what you have in mind.

00:16:18.937 --> 00:16:21.439 position:50% align:center
I'm sure this is gonna be good.

00:16:21.523 --> 00:16:22.982 position:50% align:center
[TODOROKI]
Right.

00:16:24.442 --> 00:16:25.735 position:50% align:center
[ENDEAVOR]
Look at him.

00:16:25.819 --> 00:16:28.488 position:50% align:center
I've entrusted
everything to Shoto.

00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:33.034 position:50% align:center
You know, I'd already climbed

00:16:33.118 --> 00:16:38.039 position:50% align:center
to the number-two spot
by the time I was 20.

00:16:38.123 --> 00:16:41.126 position:50% align:center
And because I'd
carved my own path,

00:16:41.209 --> 00:16:45.005 position:50% align:center
I understood.

00:16:45.088 --> 00:16:48.925 position:50% align:center
There was no way I was ever
going to reach the top.

00:16:52.429 --> 00:16:55.265 position:50% align:center
[ENDEAVOR] If I'd only wanted
the title of number one,

00:16:55.348 --> 00:16:59.269 position:50% align:center
I could've acted friendly
towards everyone like you did.

00:16:59.352 --> 00:17:00.687 position:50% align:center
But, no.

00:17:00.770 --> 00:17:06.276 position:50% align:center
I actually wanted
to be number one.

00:17:06.359 --> 00:17:07.777 position:50% align:center
Talkative today, aren't we?

00:17:07.861 --> 00:17:10.905 position:50% align:center
Just answer me!

00:17:10.989 --> 00:17:14.909 position:50% align:center
What is the symbol
of peace, huh? Heh.

00:17:14.993 --> 00:17:16.244 position:50% align:center
That's tough.

00:17:16.327 --> 00:17:20.040 position:50% align:center
I'm not certain how
to explain it to you.

00:17:20.123 --> 00:17:22.042 position:50% align:center
I thought that this
country needed a hero

00:17:22.125 --> 00:17:24.127 position:50% align:center
who could inspire them,

00:17:24.210 --> 00:17:28.590 position:50% align:center
so I ran toward that
goal at full speed.

00:17:28.673 --> 00:17:31.301 position:50% align:center
I wanted to be a light
that was a beacon of hope,

00:17:31.384 --> 00:17:33.428 position:50% align:center
as well as a warning.

00:17:33.511 --> 00:17:35.221 position:50% align:center
I swore that that's
what I would become,

00:17:35.305 --> 00:17:38.391 position:50% align:center
and I never looked back.

00:17:38.475 --> 00:17:40.977 position:50% align:center
When you walked through
the streets back then,

00:17:41.061 --> 00:17:43.396 position:50% align:center
everyone was on edge.

00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:45.565 position:50% align:center
No matter how many
heroes there were,

00:17:45.648 --> 00:17:48.276 position:50% align:center
the crime rate never went down.

00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:53.615 position:50% align:center
Even more so than now,
everyone was afraid.

00:17:53.698 --> 00:17:56.326 position:50% align:center
I'm here because I want
to do something to help you!

00:17:56.409 --> 00:17:58.661 position:50% align:center
Please, All Might.

00:17:58.745 --> 00:18:00.580 position:50% align:center
[ALL MIGHT] I ignored
the kindness of the people

00:18:00.663 --> 00:18:03.249 position:50% align:center
around me and abandoned
those dear to me

00:18:03.333 --> 00:18:05.251 position:50% align:center
to walk this path.

00:18:05.335 --> 00:18:07.128 position:50% align:center
Maybe that was a mistake.

00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:11.299 position:50% align:center

Listen, Endeavor.

00:18:13.885 --> 00:18:16.471 position:50% align:center
I understand the situation
you've been placed in

00:18:16.554 --> 00:18:18.890 position:50% align:center
and what's being said about you.

00:18:18.973 --> 00:18:20.600 position:50% align:center
There are many who
can't help but dwell

00:18:20.684 --> 00:18:22.477 position:50% align:center
on our differences.

[BUSINESSMAN 62A] It's not
that I don't like Endeavor,

00:18:23.937 --> 00:18:25.855 position:50% align:center
I just can't help but
compare him to All Might.

00:18:25.939 --> 00:18:27.190 position:50% align:center
And, ya know,
that's kind of a lot

00:18:27.273 --> 00:18:29.359 position:50% align:center
for any hero to
live up to, right?

Whoa, is that Endeavor?

00:18:34.447 --> 00:18:37.242 position:50% align:center
Seriously? That's kinda random.

00:18:37.325 --> 00:18:40.203 position:50% align:center
But you and I are
not the same person.

00:18:40.286 --> 00:18:42.288 position:50% align:center
It was my decision
to become a symbol.

00:18:42.372 --> 00:18:45.667 position:50% align:center
But you don't have
to do that. Instead,

00:18:45.750 --> 00:18:51.256 position:50% align:center

the kind of hero you want to be.

Whoa, that's a
coincidence, huh?

In the end, all
you Neanderthals

can do is resort
to useless violence.

against grade schoolers?

Stooping to their level

As Present Mic should
already have deduced,

00:21:28.788 --> 00:21:30.623 position:50% align:center
if my peers fight seriously,

00:21:30.707 --> 00:21:33.376 position:50% align:center
the children will be
left beaten, ashamed.

On the other hand,
if they use their discretion

00:21:35.879 --> 00:21:38.214 position:50% align:center
and let the children shine,
then it will only

00:21:38.298 --> 00:21:41.676 position:50% align:center
make the delinquents
even more brazen.

00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:44.304 position:50% align:center

00:21:45.722 --> 00:21:48.141 position:50% align:center
I don't think you all know
how dangerous this is.

00:21:48.224 --> 00:21:50.018 position:50% align:center
Those children are
strong and believe

00:21:50.101 --> 00:21:53.772 position:50% align:center
wholeheartedly that their Quirks
surpass those of the heroes.

00:21:53.855 --> 00:21:56.566 position:50% align:center
They won't hold back
against your trainees!

Here's the preview!

00:23:30.660 --> 00:23:32.454 position:50% align:center
The children of Masegaki
Elementary School

00:23:32.537 --> 00:23:33.997 position:50% align:center
don't have a lot
of faith in heroes

00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:36.499 position:50% align:center
and they believe they can defeat
those in the training class.

00:23:36.583 --> 00:23:37.959 position:50% align:center
That's why they've picked
a fight with Kacchan,

00:23:38.043 --> 00:23:39.753 position:50% align:center
Todoroki, and the others.

00:23:39.836 --> 00:23:41.713 position:50% align:center
If my peers use their
Quirks in the wrong ways,

00:23:41.796 --> 00:23:44.090 position:50% align:center
they won't be able to win
the hearts of these children.

00:23:44.174 --> 00:23:45.508 position:50% align:center
I know my classmates are worthy

00:23:45.592 --> 00:23:47.844 position:50% align:center
of becoming pro heroes,
but can they demonstrate

00:23:47.927 --> 00:23:49.387 position:50% align:center
that to everyone watching?

00:23:49.471 --> 00:23:52.098 position:50% align:center
Next time: "Relief for
License Trainees."

Also, Aoyama is acting even
more eccentric than usual!

Go beyond! Plus Ultra!
