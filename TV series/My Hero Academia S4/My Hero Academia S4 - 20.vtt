00:00:10.093 --> 00:00:11.594 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] Today is Saturday,
which means that

00:00:11.678 --> 00:00:13.221 position:50% align:center
Kacchan and Todoroki
don't have to go

00:00:13.304 --> 00:00:14.973 position:50% align:center
to provisional license training!

00:00:15.056 --> 00:00:17.142 position:50% align:center
So, since we've
got everyone together,

00:00:17.225 --> 00:00:19.686 position:50% align:center
we're all working on our
upcoming performance.

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:21.855 position:50% align:center
Now. Let's jam.

00:00:21.938 --> 00:00:24.232 position:50% align:center
[KATSUKI]
Murder them with music!

00:00:25.734 --> 00:00:27.819 position:50% align:center
[SERO] Perfect. That's
gonna look super cool!

00:00:27.902 --> 00:00:29.821 position:50% align:center
Let's go see what
the dance team says!

00:00:29.904 --> 00:00:31.364 position:50% align:center
I'm not sure we've
got enough people

00:00:31.448 --> 00:00:33.158 position:50% align:center
to pull something like this off.

00:00:33.241 --> 00:00:34.784 position:50% align:center
Loosen up, Midoriya!

00:00:34.868 --> 00:00:36.870 position:50% align:center
You've got to be
precise, but flexible!

00:00:36.953 --> 00:00:38.204 position:50% align:center
Just because its called a "lock"

00:00:38.288 --> 00:00:39.789 position:50% align:center
doesn't mean you
should be so rigid.

00:00:39.873 --> 00:00:41.958 position:50% align:center
So get that body moving.

00:00:45.962 --> 00:00:48.089 position:50% align:center
And then end with a pop!

00:00:48.173 --> 00:00:49.382 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU, TENYA, TSUYU, HAGAKURE]
Pop!

00:00:51.092 --> 00:00:54.262 position:50% align:center
[MIRIO] Looks like no one
has noticed me yet.

00:00:54.346 --> 00:00:56.181 position:50% align:center
I'll swoop in and hit 'em
with a can't-miss gag

00:00:56.264 --> 00:00:57.849 position:50% align:center
that'll crack 'em up before
they know what's what.

00:00:57.932 --> 00:01:00.352 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Ah-- Oh, hey, Togata!

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.230 position:50% align:center
--[IZUKU, OCHACO] Uh?
--[TSUYU] Ribbit.

00:01:06.358 --> 00:01:07.525 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU, OCHACO, TSUYU]
Eri!

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:10.487 position:50% align:center
[MIRIO] Hey, guys!
I brought a peach for ya!

00:02:41.161 --> 00:02:41.953 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Eri!

00:02:42.037 --> 00:02:43.163 position:50% align:center
Hi, Deku.

00:02:43.246 --> 00:02:45.081 position:50% align:center
Wait, don't tell me
you've got a secret kid!

00:02:45.165 --> 00:02:46.875 position:50% align:center
That dress looks great on you.

00:02:46.958 --> 00:02:49.252 position:50% align:center
You are precious!

00:02:49.336 --> 00:02:51.046 position:50% align:center
[AIZAWA]
Midoriya.

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:54.215 position:50% align:center
Finally got permission
from the principal.

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:56.217 position:50% align:center
[NEZU]
That's a good idea.

00:02:56.301 --> 00:02:57.844 position:50% align:center
But you'll have to be careful.

00:02:57.927 --> 00:02:59.387 position:50% align:center
The poor girl has been separated

00:02:59.471 --> 00:03:02.182 position:50% align:center
from normal society
for an awfully long time.

00:03:02.265 --> 00:03:04.976 position:50% align:center
I'm afraid the whole experience
could overwhelm her.

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:06.644 position:50% align:center
She'll be thrown
into a new setting

00:03:06.728 --> 00:03:10.315 position:50% align:center
that she's completely
unfamiliar with. I suggest...

00:03:10.398 --> 00:03:12.150 position:50% align:center
In order to avoid
additional stress,

00:03:12.233 --> 00:03:15.236 position:50% align:center
we're letting Eri explore
the campus before the festival.

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:16.488 position:50% align:center
Well, hello!

00:03:16.571 --> 00:03:18.615 position:50% align:center
You must be Eri,
from the work study!

00:03:18.698 --> 00:03:20.492 position:50% align:center
Very nice to meet you. I'm Iida.

00:03:20.575 --> 00:03:21.659 position:50% align:center
Mineta! Hey, there!

00:03:21.743 --> 00:03:24.120 position:50% align:center
Man, you're gonna
be a looker, aren't ya?

00:03:24.204 --> 00:03:25.288 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
Uh!

00:03:25.372 --> 00:03:27.374 position:50% align:center
[MIRIO]
Oh. Right. She's kind of shy.

00:03:27.457 --> 00:03:29.167 position:50% align:center
[TENYA]
That's perfectly okay!

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:30.543 position:50% align:center
Let's start the tour.

00:03:30.627 --> 00:03:32.462 position:50% align:center
I wanna show her as much
of the school as I can

00:03:32.545 --> 00:03:34.214 position:50% align:center
so she knows what we do here.

00:03:34.297 --> 00:03:36.675 position:50% align:center
You wanna come, too, Midoriya?

00:03:36.758 --> 00:03:37.926 position:50% align:center
Yes!

00:03:38.009 --> 00:03:40.804 position:50% align:center
[KIRISHIMA]
Dance team! New idea.

00:03:40.887 --> 00:03:42.847 position:50% align:center
Uh? It's Eri!

00:03:42.931 --> 00:03:45.684 position:50% align:center
Oh, wait, we were never
actually introduced, were we?

00:03:45.767 --> 00:03:48.061 position:50% align:center
Okay, crew, why don't
we grab a little break.

00:03:48.144 --> 00:03:50.063 position:50% align:center
It's teatime!

00:03:54.943 --> 00:03:56.361 position:50% align:center
[MIRIO]
It may be a weekend day,

00:03:56.444 --> 00:03:58.071 position:50% align:center
but since the students
live here in the dorms,

00:03:58.154 --> 00:04:00.240 position:50% align:center
there are still a ton of
people running around campus

00:04:00.323 --> 00:04:01.408 position:50% align:center
helping to prepare
for the festival.

00:04:01.491 --> 00:04:03.493 position:50% align:center
[BUSINESS STUDENT 83A]
Hey. It's Togata!

00:04:03.576 --> 00:04:05.245 position:50% align:center
Whoa! Who's that?

00:04:05.328 --> 00:04:06.996 position:50% align:center
Don't tell me your temporary
leave from school

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:09.124 position:50% align:center
was because you have a kid now!

00:04:10.208 --> 00:04:11.418 position:50% align:center
[BUSINESS STUDENT 83B]
Dude, you gotta say something.

00:04:11.501 --> 00:04:12.877 position:50% align:center
Now I feel like it's for real.

00:04:12.961 --> 00:04:14.587 position:50% align:center
[BUSINESS STUDENT 83A]
All jokes aside, here.

00:04:14.671 --> 00:04:16.381 position:50% align:center
Class 1 is putting on
an awesome lecture,

00:04:16.464 --> 00:04:18.425 position:50% align:center
so make sure you check
it out! You, too, man.

00:04:18.508 --> 00:04:19.759 position:50% align:center
Wouldn't miss it for the world!

00:04:19.843 --> 00:04:22.095 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
This is a really nice flyer!

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:24.597 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT 83A]
Can you toss me a nail?

00:04:24.681 --> 00:04:25.724 position:50% align:center
Hey, whoa, whoa, wait!

00:04:25.807 --> 00:04:27.225 position:50% align:center
Don't cover that with a poster!

00:04:27.308 --> 00:04:30.103 position:50% align:center
Everyone's super busy even
though it's still a month away.

00:04:30.186 --> 00:04:32.272 position:50% align:center
Oh, def, you gotta try
and outdo last year.

00:04:32.355 --> 00:04:33.815 position:50% align:center
And it takes a lot
of work to pull off

00:04:33.898 --> 00:04:35.066 position:50% align:center
something Plus Ultra.

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:36.484 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU yelps]

00:04:36.568 --> 00:04:39.320 position:50% align:center
[TETSUTETSU] Sorry! Hey.
It's Midoriya from Class A!

00:04:39.404 --> 00:04:41.031 position:50% align:center
Why am I not surprised, huh?

00:04:41.114 --> 00:04:42.574 position:50% align:center
You're walkin' around
like you've got

00:04:42.657 --> 00:04:44.868 position:50% align:center
nothin' to do while
we're all hustling.

00:04:44.951 --> 00:04:46.369 position:50% align:center
Eri, are you okay?

00:04:46.453 --> 00:04:48.455 position:50% align:center
I thought it was that
dragon from before.

00:04:48.538 --> 00:04:51.124 position:50% align:center
You saw a dragon?

00:04:51.207 --> 00:04:53.668 position:50% align:center
Oh. You're talking about Ryukyu.

00:04:53.752 --> 00:04:55.211 position:50% align:center
So you're just gonna ignore me?

00:04:55.295 --> 00:04:56.504 position:50% align:center
Talk about rude.

00:04:56.588 --> 00:04:58.173 position:50% align:center
I heard Class A
is doing a concert

00:04:58.256 --> 00:05:00.633 position:50% align:center
or something for us.
That's so cute.

00:05:00.717 --> 00:05:03.136 position:50% align:center
But to put it bluntly,
Class B's stellar performance

00:05:03.219 --> 00:05:05.847 position:50% align:center
is gonna make you wish
you hadn't even shown up.

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:07.474 position:50% align:center
We're doing <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>

00:05:07.557 --> 00:05:10.268 position:50% align:center
<i>and the Prisoner of Azkaban:</i>
<i>The Return of the King</i> .

00:05:10.352 --> 00:05:12.437 position:50% align:center
It's a completely original
play written by us.

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:16.441 position:50% align:center
A super spectacular
fantasy epic!

00:05:16.524 --> 00:05:18.276 position:50% align:center
You should make sure
you come prepared.

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:20.195 position:50% align:center
Bring a hankie to wipe
the tears from your eyes

00:05:20.278 --> 00:05:22.364 position:50% align:center
when you realize
how superior we are!

00:05:22.447 --> 00:05:25.367 position:50% align:center
[cackles]

00:05:27.327 --> 00:05:29.537 position:50% align:center
He's even nastier
than usual today.

00:05:29.621 --> 00:05:31.122 position:50% align:center
Yeah, sorry about that, guys,

00:05:31.206 --> 00:05:33.625 position:50% align:center
Kendo isn't around, so there's
no one to keep him in line.

00:05:33.708 --> 00:05:36.419 position:50% align:center
That's weird, the two of them
typically show up as a set.

00:05:36.503 --> 00:05:39.631 position:50% align:center
Well, she's off prepping for the
beauty pageant right now, so.

00:05:39.714 --> 00:05:40.715 position:50% align:center
Beauty what?

00:05:40.799 --> 00:05:41.591 position:50% align:center
[YOSETSU]
It's kinda funny.

00:05:41.675 --> 00:05:43.385 position:50% align:center
She didn't even mean to enter.

00:05:43.468 --> 00:05:44.969 position:50% align:center
Monoma was still right, though.

00:05:45.053 --> 00:05:47.097 position:50% align:center
We're pullin' out all the stops.

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:48.765 position:50% align:center
Sorry 'bout that,
Eri, UA's great,

00:05:48.848 --> 00:05:51.601 position:50% align:center
but every place has
its downside, I guess.

00:05:51.685 --> 00:05:53.353 position:50% align:center
Mr. Aizawa didn't say anything

00:05:53.436 --> 00:05:55.647 position:50% align:center
about there being some
kinda beauty pageant.

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:56.981 position:50% align:center
Well, it's too late to enter.

00:05:57.065 --> 00:05:58.316 position:50% align:center
But you know who's
really gunning hard

00:05:58.400 --> 00:05:59.401 position:50% align:center
to win it this time?

00:05:59.484 --> 00:06:00.944 position:50% align:center
No idea.

00:06:01.027 --> 00:06:02.529 position:50% align:center
[MIRIO]
Last year's runner-up!

00:06:02.612 --> 00:06:05.031 position:50% align:center
The Big Three's best
girl, Nejire Hado.

00:06:05.115 --> 00:06:08.827 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Hey, hey!
What's Eri doing here?

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:11.705 position:50% align:center
Hey, girl! Why ya
here? For funsies?

00:06:11.788 --> 00:06:13.039 position:50% align:center
We should put
Nejire in something

00:06:13.123 --> 00:06:15.083 position:50% align:center
that skews cute instead of sexy.

00:06:15.166 --> 00:06:16.960 position:50% align:center
Yeah, that cost her last year.

00:06:17.043 --> 00:06:19.337 position:50% align:center
You've got a flashy Quirk
and you're so nice!

00:06:19.421 --> 00:06:23.216 position:50% align:center
And your body's so bou... bou...

00:06:23.299 --> 00:06:24.634 position:50% align:center
[MIRIO]
He means balanced.

00:06:24.718 --> 00:06:27.512 position:50% align:center
But even with all that,
you were still only runner-up?

00:06:27.595 --> 00:06:29.431 position:50% align:center
Yeah, listen to this!
Are you listening?

00:06:29.514 --> 00:06:31.766 position:50% align:center
Every year, I lose
to the same girl!

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:33.768 position:50% align:center
She's just too amazing.

00:06:33.852 --> 00:06:37.272 position:50% align:center
The beauty pageant queen,
Bibimi Kenranzaki,

00:06:37.355 --> 00:06:40.025 position:50% align:center
from support course Class 3-G!

00:06:40.108 --> 00:06:41.860 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
She sounds incredible.

00:06:41.943 --> 00:06:44.320 position:50% align:center
[AMAJIKI]
This year's pageant is stacked.

00:06:44.404 --> 00:06:46.406 position:50% align:center
Kendo gained some
underground fans thanks

00:06:46.489 --> 00:06:49.075 position:50% align:center
to that commercial,
so she's a real contender.

00:06:49.159 --> 00:06:51.619 position:50% align:center
And of course, Hado
won't be holding back.

00:06:51.703 --> 00:06:54.831 position:50% align:center
Just thinking about performing
in front of all those people...

00:06:54.914 --> 00:06:57.167 position:50% align:center
It sounds like a nightmare.

00:06:57.250 --> 00:07:01.129 position:50% align:center
Imagining it makes me nauseous.

00:07:01.212 --> 00:07:03.340 position:50% align:center
At first, the only reason
I entered was because

00:07:03.423 --> 00:07:06.509 position:50% align:center
Yuyu told me to, but
turns out, it's lots of fun!

00:07:06.593 --> 00:07:08.261 position:50% align:center
I wanna crush it.

00:07:08.345 --> 00:07:11.181 position:50% align:center
That's why, this year,
I'll definitely come in first!

00:07:11.264 --> 00:07:12.974 position:50% align:center
It's my last chance.

00:07:13.058 --> 00:07:14.601 position:50% align:center
You can do it.

00:07:18.605 --> 00:07:21.941 position:50% align:center
[MIRIO] Moving on!
Next, we'll show you...

00:07:22.025 --> 00:07:23.985 position:50% align:center
The support course!

00:07:24.069 --> 00:07:25.653 position:50% align:center
All the grades are
working together to put on

00:07:25.737 --> 00:07:28.114 position:50% align:center
an extra-awesome
exhibition of their work!

00:07:28.198 --> 00:07:29.491 position:50% align:center
I can't wait to see!

00:07:29.574 --> 00:07:31.701 position:50% align:center
I hear it's a
highlight every year.

00:07:31.785 --> 00:07:33.286 position:50% align:center
Yes. The school festival

00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:35.288 position:50% align:center
is the support course's
time to shine!

00:07:35.372 --> 00:07:39.376 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Hatsume! Wait. Whoa!

00:07:39.459 --> 00:07:42.796 position:50% align:center

super-cute baby number 202.

[IZUKU] Think you might
have some grease on you.

Ha! I'm filthy, but I can't
waste time bathing.

00:07:48.301 --> 00:07:49.094 position:50% align:center
What?

00:07:49.177 --> 00:07:50.428 position:50% align:center
That's dedication.

00:07:50.512 --> 00:07:51.930 position:50% align:center
[HATSUME] Even though
we showed off some items

00:07:52.013 --> 00:07:54.766 position:50% align:center
at the sports festival, we took
a backseat to the heroes.

00:07:54.849 --> 00:07:57.227 position:50% align:center
But... this time the
contraptions we've come up with

00:07:57.310 --> 00:07:59.813 position:50% align:center
will be given the
spotlight they deserve!

00:07:59.896 --> 00:08:01.898 position:50% align:center
Which means, lots of
big companies and buyers

00:08:01.981 --> 00:08:04.359 position:50% align:center
can get up close and
personal with my work.

00:08:04.442 --> 00:08:05.735 position:50% align:center
I need to make sure
they're perfect

00:08:05.819 --> 00:08:08.029 position:50% align:center
so they don't embarrass me!

00:08:08.113 --> 00:08:10.448 position:50% align:center
How did the iron soles work out
for you, by the way?

00:08:10.532 --> 00:08:12.534 position:50% align:center
If there's anything else you
need, please let me know.

[SUPPORT STUDENT 83B]
Where's the extinguisher!

00:08:21.668 --> 00:08:24.879 position:50% align:center
Sorry. We should run.
Don't worry, Eri.

00:08:33.638 --> 00:08:36.141 position:50% align:center
[MIRIO] Welp, that's
pretty much all of UA.

00:08:36.224 --> 00:08:37.392 position:50% align:center
That's right.

00:08:37.475 --> 00:08:40.103 position:50% align:center
So, what do you think
about our school, Eri?

00:08:40.186 --> 00:08:42.522 position:50% align:center
I, uh. I'm not sure.

00:08:42.605 --> 00:08:43.940 position:50% align:center
[BOTH laugh nervously]

00:08:44.024 --> 00:08:45.608 position:50% align:center
[ERI]
But...

00:08:45.692 --> 00:08:49.154 position:50% align:center
I can see how hard everyone
is working on the festival,

00:08:49.237 --> 00:08:53.575 position:50% align:center
and I do wanna know
how it all turns out.

00:08:53.658 --> 00:08:55.326 position:50% align:center
[NEZU] It sounds like
our special visitor

00:08:55.410 --> 00:08:57.537 position:50% align:center
is getting excited.

00:08:57.620 --> 00:09:00.457 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] Principal Nezu!
Ms. Midnight! Hello!

00:09:02.334 --> 00:09:04.127 position:50% align:center
It seems like we made
the right choice.

00:09:04.210 --> 00:09:06.129 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
That was a lot of cheese.

00:09:06.212 --> 00:09:09.382 position:50% align:center
Know what? I'm excited
for everything, too.

00:09:09.466 --> 00:09:11.968 position:50% align:center
I love seeing so many
students joining together

00:09:12.052 --> 00:09:14.554 position:50% align:center
and having fun, all in
the hopes that their peers

00:09:14.637 --> 00:09:16.014 position:50% align:center
will have a good time.

00:09:16.097 --> 00:09:17.557 position:50% align:center
Now, if we could
just get the police

00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:18.892 position:50% align:center
to understand that.

00:09:18.975 --> 00:09:21.144 position:50% align:center
Now, now, Kayama.

00:09:21.227 --> 00:09:23.646 position:50% align:center
Anyway, I hope your hearts
burst with happiness

00:09:23.730 --> 00:09:26.524 position:50% align:center
when the day rolls around.

00:09:26.608 --> 00:09:29.694 position:50% align:center
[POLICE CHIEF]
You must cancel this festival.

00:09:29.778 --> 00:09:31.905 position:50% align:center
I can't believe the head
of the police himself

00:09:31.988 --> 00:09:33.156 position:50% align:center
is paying me a visit.

00:09:33.239 --> 00:09:34.616 position:50% align:center
[POLICE CHIEF] Villains
are becoming more daring

00:09:34.699 --> 00:09:36.951 position:50% align:center
and our heroes are
losing confidence.

00:09:37.035 --> 00:09:38.953 position:50% align:center
If something were
to happen to UA again,

00:09:39.037 --> 00:09:41.998 position:50% align:center
we might not be able to recover.

00:09:42.082 --> 00:09:44.125 position:50% align:center
I understand that. However--

00:09:44.209 --> 00:09:47.671 position:50% align:center
Listen. You're putting
everyone here at risk.

00:09:51.132 --> 00:09:53.635 position:50% align:center
[NEZU] I firmly believe that,
because of the trying times

00:09:53.718 --> 00:09:56.471 position:50% align:center
we're living in, the students
need an event like this.

00:09:56.554 --> 00:10:00.350 position:50% align:center
We'll make sure it's safe.
Please let us continue.

00:10:00.433 --> 00:10:02.560 position:50% align:center
We can't let the future
look any bleaker

00:10:02.644 --> 00:10:04.979 position:50% align:center
than it already does.

00:10:06.189 --> 00:10:08.358 position:50% align:center
I'll spare you all
the gory details,

00:10:08.441 --> 00:10:10.694 position:50% align:center
but the principal
fought hard for you.

00:10:10.777 --> 00:10:12.529 position:50% align:center
As a result, security
will be heavier

00:10:12.612 --> 00:10:15.073 position:50% align:center
than in past years. Just know.

00:10:15.156 --> 00:10:17.325 position:50% align:center
If an alarm sounds,
even if it's a false one,

00:10:17.409 --> 00:10:19.369 position:50% align:center
we'll have to shut
down and evacuate.

00:10:19.452 --> 00:10:21.830 position:50% align:center
Those were the terms
the police agreed upon.

00:10:21.913 --> 00:10:23.081 position:50% align:center
That's strict.

00:10:23.164 --> 00:10:24.749 position:50% align:center
Of course, to keep
that from happening,

00:10:24.833 --> 00:10:27.544 position:50% align:center
we're also beefing up
our defensive measures.

00:10:27.627 --> 00:10:29.879 position:50% align:center
We even let Hound Dog
off his leash to patrol.

00:10:29.963 --> 00:10:31.339 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
You did?

00:10:31.423 --> 00:10:32.590 position:50% align:center
Oh, yes.

00:10:32.674 --> 00:10:34.092 position:50% align:center
Did you know Class A's
performance is causing

00:10:34.175 --> 00:10:35.885 position:50% align:center
quite a stir in
the faculty lounge?

00:10:35.969 --> 00:10:37.721 position:50% align:center
You'd better make
it pleasurable.

00:10:37.804 --> 00:10:39.431 position:50% align:center
Right!

00:10:39.514 --> 00:10:41.683 position:50% align:center
[ERI]
Deku? What performance?

00:10:41.766 --> 00:10:43.685 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
We're doing a big live concert!

00:10:43.768 --> 00:10:45.437 position:50% align:center
I'm on the dance team!

00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:47.272 position:50% align:center
And I'm gonna do
my best to make it fun

00:10:47.355 --> 00:10:49.149 position:50% align:center
for you and everybody else.

00:10:49.232 --> 00:10:51.443 position:50% align:center
So be sure you come watch!

00:10:51.526 --> 00:10:54.696 position:50% align:center
Sorry, you two. My break
is almost over. I'm off.

00:10:54.779 --> 00:10:56.072 position:50% align:center
Okay! Just so you know,

00:10:56.156 --> 00:10:59.659 position:50% align:center
I'm lookin' forward to
seeing you get down, too!

00:10:59.743 --> 00:11:00.660 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
And then...

00:11:00.744 --> 00:11:04.080 position:50% align:center
A week later, it happened.

00:11:04.164 --> 00:11:06.082 position:50% align:center
[ASHIDO]
Midoriya.

00:11:06.166 --> 00:11:08.126 position:50% align:center
I've got bad news.

00:11:08.209 --> 00:11:10.170 position:50% align:center
You're fired from
the dance team!

[ASHIDO] You're fired
from the dance team!

00:11:22.724 --> 00:11:25.143 position:50% align:center
Oops, maybe that
sounded a little harsh.

00:11:25.226 --> 00:11:27.562 position:50% align:center
You've been scouted
by another team.

00:11:27.645 --> 00:11:29.147 position:50% align:center
You'll be on
special effects now.

00:11:29.230 --> 00:11:30.774 position:50% align:center
It has to be me?

00:11:30.857 --> 00:11:33.485 position:50% align:center
I already told Eri
that I'd be dancing.

00:11:33.568 --> 00:11:34.778 position:50% align:center
They wanna make it so Aoyama's

00:11:34.861 --> 00:11:37.113 position:50% align:center
swung around enough that
the whole room's lit up!

00:11:37.197 --> 00:11:38.198 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
I'm pretty sure

00:11:38.281 --> 00:11:39.824 position:50% align:center
everyone's gonna
be able to see him.

00:11:39.908 --> 00:11:41.910 position:50% align:center
[ASHIDO] But we don't have
a fly system in the gym,

00:11:41.993 --> 00:11:43.578 position:50% align:center
so they want someone
with a power Quirk

00:11:43.661 --> 00:11:45.538 position:50% align:center
to move him by hand.

00:11:46.915 --> 00:11:48.166 position:50% align:center
[AOYAMA] At the beginning
of the performance,

00:11:48.249 --> 00:11:51.127 position:50% align:center
I shall transform from
a dancer into a disco ball.

00:11:51.211 --> 00:11:53.505 position:50% align:center
It's the perfect job for <i>moi</i> .

00:11:53.588 --> 00:11:55.006 position:50% align:center
Say you'll help us!

00:11:55.090 --> 00:11:57.676 position:50% align:center
So, I'll be behind the scenes,
where people can't see me.

00:11:57.759 --> 00:11:58.802 position:50% align:center
[KIRISHIMA]
Sorry! It'll waste

00:11:58.885 --> 00:12:00.345 position:50% align:center
the dance practice you put in.

00:12:00.428 --> 00:12:02.305 position:50% align:center
But can you please
help us out with this?

00:12:02.389 --> 00:12:04.474 position:50% align:center
We don't want people
to lose interest.

00:12:04.557 --> 00:12:06.935 position:50% align:center
We've got to come up with
something better, you guys.

00:12:07.018 --> 00:12:08.645 position:50% align:center
When Aoyama turns
into a disco ball,

00:12:08.728 --> 00:12:10.105 position:50% align:center
it'll only be
interesting to watch

00:12:10.188 --> 00:12:11.898 position:50% align:center
for a minute or two. Right?

00:12:11.981 --> 00:12:13.358 position:50% align:center
I don't think anyone
will even care

00:12:13.441 --> 00:12:15.527 position:50% align:center
after the initial shock.

00:12:15.610 --> 00:12:18.488 position:50% align:center
Wait, I know! What if
he flies around?

00:12:18.571 --> 00:12:21.116 position:50% align:center
We can swing him over
the audience's heads!

00:12:21.199 --> 00:12:22.075 position:50% align:center

00:12:40.552 --> 00:12:42.137 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] We have practice
and meetings like this

00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:44.597 position:50% align:center
after class every day.

00:12:44.681 --> 00:12:48.435 position:50% align:center
I won't have much free time
until the festival is over.

00:12:48.518 --> 00:12:51.730 position:50% align:center
And so, I try to train hard
when I get the chance.

[grunts]

00:12:54.607 --> 00:12:56.359 position:50% align:center
It's still hard for you
to shoot consecutively

00:12:56.443 --> 00:12:58.445 position:50% align:center
or while moving around.

00:12:58.528 --> 00:13:00.363 position:50% align:center
That'll be a nasty bruise.

00:13:00.447 --> 00:13:02.032 position:50% align:center
Here, you can ice it with this.

00:13:02.115 --> 00:13:06.161 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] Thanks. I'm trying to
exercise so much more control

00:13:06.244 --> 00:13:07.996 position:50% align:center
than I've had to in the past.

00:13:08.079 --> 00:13:09.497 position:50% align:center
Is there a trick
to it or something

00:13:09.581 --> 00:13:10.915 position:50% align:center
that I might be missing?

00:13:10.999 --> 00:13:12.500 position:50% align:center
No idea.

00:13:12.584 --> 00:13:14.044 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Mm...

00:13:14.127 --> 00:13:16.129 position:50% align:center
To be honest, I was able
to use 100 percent

00:13:16.212 --> 00:13:18.715 position:50% align:center
of One For All
pretty much right away.

00:13:18.798 --> 00:13:21.634 position:50% align:center
I can only reiterate the advice
I gave you in the beginning.

00:13:21.718 --> 00:13:23.345 position:50% align:center
To create an image in your head.

00:13:23.428 --> 00:13:24.929 position:50% align:center
The egg, remember?

00:13:25.013 --> 00:13:26.765 position:50% align:center
Keep working and
focus on how it feels

00:13:26.848 --> 00:13:28.099 position:50% align:center
when you're successful.

00:13:28.183 --> 00:13:30.435 position:50% align:center
I think all you can do
is repeat those ste--

00:13:30.518 --> 00:13:32.645 position:50% align:center
You haven't done
that in a while!

00:13:34.272 --> 00:13:36.024 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] Even though we both
started out Quirkless,

00:13:36.107 --> 00:13:38.318 position:50% align:center
there's a huge
difference between us.

00:13:38.401 --> 00:13:40.612 position:50% align:center
All Might really is
a natural-born hero,

00:13:40.695 --> 00:13:43.782 position:50% align:center

There's no doubt about it.

Hatsume? What're--?

00:13:50.580 --> 00:13:51.623 position:50% align:center
Sorry, I sometimes test...

00:13:51.706 --> 00:13:52.957 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Wait, isn't this bad?

00:13:53.041 --> 00:13:54.417 position:50% align:center
To be seen out here with him?

00:13:54.501 --> 00:13:56.378 position:50% align:center
[ALL MIGHT]
Don't worry about it.

00:13:56.461 --> 00:13:57.879 position:50% align:center

third eye I'm working on.

[IZUKU] And, she's not
interested in me at all.

00:14:02.175 --> 00:14:03.718 position:50% align:center
[HATSUME]
Oh, yeah! Midoriya!

00:14:03.802 --> 00:14:06.846 position:50% align:center
About that new item you
asked me for the other day.

00:14:06.930 --> 00:14:08.848 position:50% align:center
I had a baby that could
do something similar,

00:14:08.932 --> 00:14:11.476 position:50% align:center
so I'm rejiggering it right now.

00:14:11.559 --> 00:14:12.894 position:50% align:center
Once the application
goes through,

00:14:12.977 --> 00:14:14.270 position:50% align:center
I'll get it to you right away!

00:14:14.354 --> 00:14:15.814 position:50% align:center
Hold on.

00:14:15.897 --> 00:14:17.899 position:50% align:center
I thought you needed to wait
until after the school festiva--

00:14:17.982 --> 00:14:20.527 position:50% align:center
Please, every artist tinkers
when they're on a break.

00:14:20.610 --> 00:14:23.405 position:50% align:center
And since I've got a base
already, it'll be done soon!

00:14:23.488 --> 00:14:26.408 position:50% align:center
Oh, wow. Thanks.
You're the greatest!

00:14:26.491 --> 00:14:28.493 position:50% align:center
Huh? Where are
you going, baby?

00:14:28.576 --> 00:14:30.078 position:50% align:center
Wait for Mama!

00:14:30.161 --> 00:14:31.621 position:50% align:center
A new item, huh?

00:14:31.705 --> 00:14:33.415 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] Yup. There's something
I think could help

00:14:33.498 --> 00:14:35.750 position:50% align:center
harness this wind pressure move.

00:14:35.834 --> 00:14:37.961 position:50% align:center
[ALL MIGHT]
Ah, I see.

00:14:38.044 --> 00:14:40.588 position:50% align:center
I tried something like
that in the past, too.

00:14:40.672 --> 00:14:42.674 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] All Might,
you used a support item?

00:14:42.757 --> 00:14:44.009 position:50% align:center
How did I not know that?

00:14:44.092 --> 00:14:45.260 position:50% align:center
Well, yeah.

00:14:45.343 --> 00:14:47.012 position:50% align:center
But it was too bulky
to be functional,

00:14:47.095 --> 00:14:48.346 position:50% align:center
even though it was
designed to use

00:14:48.430 --> 00:14:50.765 position:50% align:center
with only 20 to 30
percent of my power.

00:14:50.849 --> 00:14:52.100 position:50% align:center
It would've been
fine if I used

00:14:52.183 --> 00:14:54.310 position:50% align:center
mid- to long-range attacks
for the most part,

00:14:54.394 --> 00:14:56.271 position:50% align:center
but since I was more of
a short-range brawler,

00:14:56.354 --> 00:14:58.898 position:50% align:center
I kept breaking it.

00:14:58.982 --> 00:15:00.734 position:50% align:center
I got rid of the
tech and carried on

00:15:00.817 --> 00:15:02.652 position:50% align:center
with nothing but
my own strapping body!

00:15:02.736 --> 00:15:05.155 position:50% align:center
Haven't seen that
form in a while.

00:15:05.238 --> 00:15:08.867 position:50% align:center
[hacks] That said,
reinforcing your power

00:15:08.950 --> 00:15:10.869 position:50% align:center
with new gear could be smart.

00:15:10.952 --> 00:15:14.080 position:50% align:center
Just make sure you don't
rely on it too much.

00:15:14.164 --> 00:15:15.665 position:50% align:center
Some people aren't
able to hold their own

00:15:15.749 --> 00:15:17.667 position:50% align:center
after losing an item.

00:15:17.751 --> 00:15:20.962 position:50% align:center
I've seen way too many heroes
fall into that trap.

00:15:21.046 --> 00:15:23.340 position:50% align:center
Right.

00:15:23.423 --> 00:15:24.466 position:50% align:center
Now then.

00:15:24.549 --> 00:15:26.801 position:50% align:center
Let's get back to
that visualization.

00:15:26.885 --> 00:15:30.263 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] Aw. This feels
just like old times!

00:15:32.182 --> 00:15:33.892 position:50% align:center
[KATSUKI]
You're rushing, bastard!

00:15:33.975 --> 00:15:35.185 position:50% align:center
Follow my tempo!

00:15:35.268 --> 00:15:36.895 position:50% align:center
But you keep throwing
in new breakdowns--

00:15:36.978 --> 00:15:39.022 position:50% align:center
it's so confusing.

00:15:39.105 --> 00:15:42.067 position:50% align:center
[YAOYOROZU] Jiro, it's almost
like you were born to teach.

00:15:42.150 --> 00:15:44.194 position:50% align:center
For a beginner like Kaminari
to be able to learn

00:15:44.277 --> 00:15:46.780 position:50% align:center
chord progressions in
just a week is impressive.

00:15:46.863 --> 00:15:48.239 position:50% align:center
It's okay, I guess.

00:15:48.323 --> 00:15:50.658 position:50% align:center
Anyway, today's tea
smells really good!

00:15:50.742 --> 00:15:52.243 position:50% align:center
I'm glad you noticed!

00:15:52.327 --> 00:15:55.205 position:50% align:center
Mother sent me this rare type
that can be impossible to find.

00:15:55.288 --> 00:15:57.999 position:50% align:center
It's a tea called
Gold Tips Imperial.

00:15:58.083 --> 00:16:00.168 position:50% align:center
Oh! Everyone, please
enjoy a cup if you'd like.

00:16:00.251 --> 00:16:01.795 position:50% align:center
[HAGAKURE] No idea what
that is, but thanks!

00:16:01.878 --> 00:16:03.922 position:50% align:center
[ASHIDO] No idea what that is,
but it sounds boujie!

00:16:04.005 --> 00:16:05.590 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] All Might had an item,
All Might had an item,

00:16:05.674 --> 00:16:06.841 position:50% align:center
All Might had an item.

00:16:06.925 --> 00:16:08.051 position:50% align:center
I'm such a failure for
not knowing about it.

00:16:08.134 --> 00:16:09.636 position:50% align:center
Hey, Deku, aren't
you going to try

00:16:09.719 --> 00:16:11.721 position:50% align:center
some of Momo's yummy tea?

00:16:11.805 --> 00:16:15.475 position:50% align:center
--[yelps]
--[IZUKU muttering]

00:16:15.558 --> 00:16:18.061 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU gasps] Shoot!
I didn't mean to play that.

00:16:18.144 --> 00:16:20.230 position:50% align:center
[GENTLE]
Gentle Video.

00:16:21.481 --> 00:16:23.274 position:50% align:center
[GENTLE] Dearest viewers,
do you drink different types

00:16:23.358 --> 00:16:25.193 position:50% align:center
of tea for different occasions?

00:16:25.276 --> 00:16:26.986 position:50% align:center
Whenever I'm preparing
my personal kettle...

00:16:27.070 --> 00:16:30.115 position:50% align:center
A video about tea?
Perfect! Here.

00:16:30.198 --> 00:16:31.449 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah, thanks.

00:16:31.533 --> 00:16:34.119 position:50% align:center
This particular fine blend
is called Royal Flush.

00:16:34.202 --> 00:16:36.788 position:50% align:center
Whatever could that
name imply, I wonder.

00:16:36.871 --> 00:16:38.039 position:50% align:center
[LA BRAVA]
That your discriminating taste

00:16:38.123 --> 00:16:40.250 position:50% align:center
sets you apart from
the rest of the world?

00:16:40.333 --> 00:16:41.876 position:50% align:center
[GENTLE]
Be sure to stay tuned.

00:16:41.960 --> 00:16:43.670 position:50% align:center
My next video is an alarm,

00:16:43.753 --> 00:16:47.007 position:50% align:center
not just to my faithful viewers,
but to all of society.

00:16:47.090 --> 00:16:51.094 position:50% align:center
Try to contain your
anticipation until then.

00:16:51.177 --> 00:16:52.095 position:50% align:center
That was short.

00:16:52.178 --> 00:16:53.430 position:50% align:center
It's Gentle.

00:16:53.513 --> 00:16:54.597 position:50% align:center
[OCHACO]
Is he famous?

00:16:54.681 --> 00:16:56.850 position:50% align:center
People don't seem
to like him very much.

00:16:56.933 --> 00:16:59.644 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
I only kind of know who he is.

00:16:59.728 --> 00:17:01.521 position:50% align:center
He's a villain who's
known for causing trouble

00:17:01.604 --> 00:17:02.522 position:50% align:center
and recording it.

00:17:02.605 --> 00:17:03.898 position:50% align:center
Oh.

00:17:03.982 --> 00:17:05.483 position:50% align:center
It's kind of nuts that he's
been putting out videos

00:17:05.567 --> 00:17:07.777 position:50% align:center
for years now but
hasn't been caught yet.

00:17:07.861 --> 00:17:10.321 position:50% align:center
I wonder what
he's planning next.

00:17:12.699 --> 00:17:14.200 position:50% align:center
[GENTLE]
Ugh.

00:17:14.284 --> 00:17:15.285 position:50% align:center
Poor Gentle.

00:17:15.368 --> 00:17:16.494 position:50% align:center
You've been working so hard

00:17:16.578 --> 00:17:18.455 position:50% align:center
that you've skipped
tea breaks for a week.

00:17:18.538 --> 00:17:19.581 position:50% align:center
Are you all right?

00:17:19.664 --> 00:17:21.666 position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:17:21.750 --> 00:17:22.542 position:50% align:center
La Brava.

00:17:22.625 --> 00:17:23.918 position:50% align:center
Recently, heroes have begun

00:17:24.002 --> 00:17:26.046 position:50% align:center
to fall out of favor
with the public.

00:17:26.129 --> 00:17:28.089 position:50% align:center
Their feckless actions
have bred distrust

00:17:28.173 --> 00:17:31.217 position:50% align:center
from the masses. It's obvious
these so-called do-gooders

00:17:31.301 --> 00:17:33.595 position:50% align:center
are ill-prepared
for complications.

00:17:33.678 --> 00:17:35.013 position:50% align:center
They don't seem to comprehend

00:17:35.096 --> 00:17:37.640 position:50% align:center
the crisis they're in. If they
did, they wouldn't dream

00:17:37.724 --> 00:17:39.225 position:50% align:center
of putting on a school festival

00:17:39.309 --> 00:17:41.144 position:50% align:center
in these most
harrowing of times.

00:17:41.227 --> 00:17:43.063 position:50% align:center
Yeah, but, Gentle,
I don't know how I feel

00:17:43.146 --> 00:17:44.689 position:50% align:center
about involving these
innocent children

00:17:44.773 --> 00:17:46.900 position:50% align:center
in all of this, you know?

00:17:46.983 --> 00:17:50.695 position:50% align:center
[laughs] My dear,
this scheme of mine

00:17:50.779 --> 00:17:52.614 position:50% align:center
is merely a wake-up call.

00:17:52.697 --> 00:17:54.282 position:50% align:center
Following my
masterful incursion,

00:17:54.366 --> 00:17:57.118 position:50% align:center
the future heroes will be
encouraged to grow stronger!

00:17:57.202 --> 00:17:59.662 position:50% align:center
Your plan is going to
inspire youthful minds?

00:17:59.746 --> 00:18:02.332 position:50% align:center
You're so cool, Gentle!

00:18:02.415 --> 00:18:05.543 position:50% align:center
Now, let us go over the
route we'll take to invade.

00:18:05.627 --> 00:18:08.129 position:50% align:center
Open the Criminal Folder!

00:18:11.341 --> 00:18:12.384 position:50% align:center
[GENTLE]
It won't open.

00:18:12.467 --> 00:18:14.344 position:50% align:center
Oh, sorry, I locked
it for protection.

00:18:14.427 --> 00:18:15.762 position:50% align:center
Just right-click there.

00:18:15.845 --> 00:18:17.681 position:50% align:center
[click]

00:18:17.764 --> 00:18:19.349 position:50% align:center
[GENTLE]
This path has the fewest number

00:18:19.432 --> 00:18:21.935 position:50% align:center
of hero agencies
and the least traffic.

00:18:22.018 --> 00:18:23.687 position:50% align:center
At five o'clock the morning of,

00:18:23.770 --> 00:18:26.106 position:50% align:center
we will make for
a side road here.

00:18:26.189 --> 00:18:28.775 position:50% align:center
[LA BRAVA] Why not just
use your Quirk instead?

00:18:28.858 --> 00:18:30.652 position:50% align:center
It would be unwise
given there are heroes

00:18:30.735 --> 00:18:32.445 position:50% align:center
who patrol the skies.

00:18:32.529 --> 00:18:35.198 position:50% align:center
After a jaunt, we'll stroll
through a lovely park.

00:18:35.281 --> 00:18:38.118 position:50% align:center
Once we're on the other side,
we'll almost be there.

00:18:38.201 --> 00:18:40.620 position:50% align:center
If we move carefully
to avoid drawing attention,

00:18:40.704 --> 00:18:43.998 position:50% align:center
it should take us 60 to 65
minutes at the most.

00:18:44.082 --> 00:18:46.543 position:50% align:center
And then...! I'm
delighted by this part.

00:18:46.626 --> 00:18:48.503 position:50% align:center
See this old house
standing in the shadow

00:18:48.586 --> 00:18:50.088 position:50% align:center
of a hardware store.

00:18:50.171 --> 00:18:51.172 position:50% align:center
[LA BRAVA]
Yes.

00:18:51.256 --> 00:18:53.091 position:50% align:center
[GENTLE]
It's actually a charming café!

00:18:53.174 --> 00:18:54.259 position:50% align:center
[LA BRAVA]
You're not going to have

00:18:54.342 --> 00:18:56.845 position:50% align:center
your tea outside,
as usual? That's risky!

00:18:56.928 --> 00:18:59.389 position:50% align:center
The owner is passing
70 and barely managing

00:18:59.472 --> 00:19:01.224 position:50% align:center
to keep his business open.

00:19:01.307 --> 00:19:02.684 position:50% align:center
It's a shame.

00:19:02.767 --> 00:19:04.853 position:50% align:center
No one notices that it's
anything more than an old home,

00:19:04.936 --> 00:19:06.855 position:50% align:center
and there are only
five or six regulars.

00:19:06.938 --> 00:19:08.606 position:50% align:center
But, La Brava,
there is no question.

00:19:08.690 --> 00:19:10.567 position:50% align:center
I must drink there.

00:19:10.650 --> 00:19:13.486 position:50% align:center
Because this café carries
the most lauded of tea leaves.

00:19:13.570 --> 00:19:16.990 position:50% align:center
The elusive Gold Tips Imperial!

00:19:17.073 --> 00:19:19.242 position:50% align:center
Don't you think it's fitting
for the grand caper

00:19:19.325 --> 00:19:21.202 position:50% align:center
we're about to pull off?

00:19:21.286 --> 00:19:23.329 position:50% align:center
Of course!

00:19:23.413 --> 00:19:25.165 position:50% align:center
And because of the
owner's advanced age,

00:19:25.248 --> 00:19:27.167 position:50% align:center
it opens early, at 7AM.

00:19:27.250 --> 00:19:29.085 position:50% align:center
We can enjoy
90 minutes of teatime

00:19:29.169 --> 00:19:30.587 position:50% align:center
if we get there
when the doors open.

00:19:30.670 --> 00:19:33.173 position:50% align:center
This is way more research
than you usually do.

00:19:33.256 --> 00:19:35.258 position:50% align:center
[GENTLE] After that,
we go back to the side street

00:19:35.342 --> 00:19:37.385 position:50% align:center
and past the construction
site where we'll find

00:19:37.469 --> 00:19:41.056 position:50% align:center
a slightly sloping mountain
surrounded by forest.

00:19:41.139 --> 00:19:42.724 position:50% align:center
Once we climb that,

00:19:42.807 --> 00:19:45.477 position:50% align:center
we will arrive at UA.

00:19:45.560 --> 00:19:47.771 position:50% align:center
Most likely, we'll have
to deal with Hound Dog,

00:19:47.854 --> 00:19:50.106 position:50% align:center
who excels at
sniffing out intruders.

00:19:50.190 --> 00:19:52.067 position:50% align:center
Once we get to the forest,
we must rub dirt

00:19:52.150 --> 00:19:54.361 position:50% align:center
and leaves over our
bodies to hide our scent

00:19:54.444 --> 00:19:55.695 position:50% align:center
from the mongrel.

00:19:55.779 --> 00:19:57.197 position:50% align:center
And as for the school.

00:19:57.280 --> 00:20:00.408 position:50% align:center
There is a sensored security
system called the UA Barrier

00:20:00.492 --> 00:20:02.077 position:50% align:center
that's nigh
impenetrable and covers

00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:04.037 position:50% align:center
the entirety of the campus.

00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:06.998 position:50% align:center
And that's where my job
comes in, right, Gentle?

00:20:07.082 --> 00:20:08.958 position:50% align:center
I'll infiltrate UA's
internal network

00:20:09.042 --> 00:20:12.712 position:50% align:center
and secretly disable the
sensors! Because, not to brag,

00:20:12.796 --> 00:20:15.924 position:50% align:center
but I'm a highly
skilled master hacker!

00:20:16.007 --> 00:20:19.803 position:50% align:center
I truly have the most
wonderful partner imaginable.

00:20:19.886 --> 00:20:22.722 position:50% align:center
My dear, I am forever grateful
to have you at my side.

00:20:22.806 --> 00:20:23.848 position:50% align:center
[LA BRAVA]
Oh, stop, Gentle!

00:20:23.932 --> 00:20:26.685 position:50% align:center
Anything you need!
You know I love you!

00:20:27.894 --> 00:20:31.189 position:50% align:center
La Brava. I do mean it.

00:20:31.272 --> 00:20:32.982 position:50% align:center
When I first began...

00:20:33.066 --> 00:20:35.026 position:50% align:center
...I learned how
to upload my videos.

00:20:35.110 --> 00:20:37.237 position:50% align:center
But technology oft eludes me.

00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:38.697 position:50% align:center
Alas, there were few views,

00:20:38.780 --> 00:20:41.366 position:50% align:center
and the rare comments
I did get were harsh.

00:20:41.449 --> 00:20:44.202 position:50% align:center
It's only received 56 views!

00:20:44.285 --> 00:20:46.621 position:50% align:center
And it's already been
uploaded for over a month.

[doorbell rings]

00:20:48.957 --> 00:20:50.750 position:50% align:center
[GENTLE]
That doorbell signaled the end

00:20:50.834 --> 00:20:53.670 position:50% align:center
of my melancholy days.

00:20:53.753 --> 00:20:55.296 position:50% align:center
[LA BRAVA]
I'm sorry. I...

00:20:55.380 --> 00:20:57.966 position:50% align:center
I hacked into your account
to get your address.

00:20:58.049 --> 00:20:59.509 position:50% align:center
I'm a fan.

00:20:59.592 --> 00:21:02.262 position:50% align:center
I can help you carve
your name into history!

00:21:02.345 --> 00:21:04.222 position:50% align:center
May I?

00:21:04.305 --> 00:21:07.892 position:50% align:center
[GENTLE]
It was you! My first admirer.

00:21:09.769 --> 00:21:12.439 position:50% align:center
To be honest,
I had my misgivings.

00:21:12.522 --> 00:21:15.692 position:50% align:center
I was terrified that
I was being too careless.

00:21:15.775 --> 00:21:18.737 position:50% align:center
But then... When we
began plotting, recording,

00:21:18.820 --> 00:21:21.823 position:50% align:center
and editing as one,
the views on my videos

00:21:21.906 --> 00:21:24.617 position:50% align:center
began to increase!

00:21:24.701 --> 00:21:25.994 position:50% align:center
La Brava!

00:21:26.077 --> 00:21:28.580 position:50% align:center
 I am betting my soul
and my prized moustache

00:21:28.663 --> 00:21:30.540 position:50% align:center
on this audacious
festival scheme!

00:21:30.623 --> 00:21:34.169 position:50% align:center
For the world, for society,
for my courageous dream,

00:21:34.252 --> 00:21:39.007 position:50% align:center
and to honor the feelings
you have for me.

00:21:39.090 --> 00:21:40.175 position:50% align:center
Gentle!

00:21:40.258 --> 00:21:42.052 position:50% align:center
[GENTLE]
My La Brava!

00:21:42.135 --> 00:21:46.681 position:50% align:center
Oh! I love you,
my Gentle Criminal!

00:21:46.765 --> 00:21:49.351 position:50% align:center
I love you, too,
my darling girl!

00:21:49.434 --> 00:21:52.354 position:50% align:center
I'll make certain
nothing stops me.

00:21:53.688 --> 00:21:57.567 position:50% align:center
[GENTLE]
No matter what. We will succeed.

00:23:29.325 --> 00:23:30.702 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Here's the preview!

00:23:30.785 --> 00:23:33.204 position:50% align:center
It's finally time for the
UA school festival to start.

00:23:33.288 --> 00:23:34.914 position:50% align:center
Early in the morning,
I have to go buy some

00:23:34.998 --> 00:23:37.000 position:50% align:center
extra supplies for
our performance.

00:23:37.083 --> 00:23:39.210 position:50% align:center
And while I'm out,
I have a fateful encounter

00:23:39.294 --> 00:23:41.421 position:50% align:center
with an infamous character.

00:23:41.504 --> 00:23:44.299 position:50% align:center
He said, "You'll
ruin the aftertaste

00:23:44.382 --> 00:23:47.427 position:50% align:center
of the Gold Tips Imperial."

00:23:47.510 --> 00:23:51.056 position:50% align:center
Next time: "Deku vs.
Gentle Criminal."

00:23:51.139 --> 00:23:52.932 position:50% align:center
Stay away from UA.

00:23:53.016 --> 00:23:55.101 position:50% align:center
I won't let you
ruin the festival!

00:23:55.185 --> 00:23:57.812 position:50% align:center
Go beyond! Plus Ultra!
