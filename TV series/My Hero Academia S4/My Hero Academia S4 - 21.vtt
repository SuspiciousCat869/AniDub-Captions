00:00:09.843 --> 00:00:11.803 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Tomorrow's finally the day.

00:00:11.886 --> 00:00:13.805 position:50% align:center
It's the school festival!

00:00:13.888 --> 00:00:15.640 position:50% align:center
We'll have to clear
outta the gym soon!

00:00:15.724 --> 00:00:18.309 position:50% align:center
But we should have enough time
for one more run through!

00:00:20.562 --> 00:00:21.521 position:50% align:center
Look alive!

00:00:21.604 --> 00:00:23.857 position:50% align:center
And one, and two, and three.

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:27.944 position:50% align:center
And one, and two,
and three. And pose!

00:00:28.028 --> 00:00:31.197 position:50% align:center
Then Aoyama goes to the center
and Midoriya books it offstage.

00:00:31.281 --> 00:00:32.282 position:50% align:center
--[IZUKU] On it!
--[AOYAMA] Oui.

00:00:32.365 --> 00:00:34.200 position:50% align:center
Midoriya. You're still
lacking passion.

00:00:34.284 --> 00:00:36.036 position:50% align:center
So bring the fire!

00:00:36.119 --> 00:00:37.412 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Roger!

00:00:37.495 --> 00:00:39.581 position:50% align:center
I was scared we were
gonna seem like amateurs.

00:00:39.664 --> 00:00:41.499 position:50% align:center
But things are looking good.

00:00:41.583 --> 00:00:43.752 position:50% align:center
The band and dance teams
are stepping up their games

00:00:43.835 --> 00:00:45.086 position:50% align:center
and putting in the work.

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:47.505 position:50% align:center
Guess it helps that
Ashido's a merciless coach.

00:00:47.589 --> 00:00:48.882 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:00:48.965 --> 00:00:52.635 position:50% align:center
Dancing's her thing,
so she's taking this seriously.

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:56.598 position:50% align:center
Let's murder everyone
in UA with killer music!

00:00:56.681 --> 00:00:58.641 position:50% align:center
I think Bakugo
fired everyone up.

00:00:58.725 --> 00:01:00.602 position:50% align:center
And not just the band members.

00:01:00.685 --> 00:01:02.479 position:50% align:center
I'll admit, I am getting
a little nervous.

00:01:02.562 --> 00:01:04.647 position:50% align:center
Hey, don't improvise
during the actual concert.

00:01:04.731 --> 00:01:05.899 position:50% align:center
Huh?!

00:01:05.982 --> 00:01:07.233 position:50% align:center
It's just, not everyone
can keep up with you.

00:01:07.317 --> 00:01:08.818 position:50% align:center
Why you gotta drag
me like that, Jiro?

00:01:08.902 --> 00:01:11.738 position:50% align:center
I don't think you're the only
one she's talking about, friend.

00:01:11.821 --> 00:01:15.241 position:50% align:center
We need you up on that catwalk,
like, yesterday, so hurry.

00:01:15.325 --> 00:01:17.952 position:50% align:center
When Aoyama's in place,
get him in the air.

00:01:18.036 --> 00:01:19.662 position:50% align:center
Wee!

00:01:19.746 --> 00:01:21.998 position:50% align:center
[ASHIDO]
That's it! Perfect!

00:01:22.082 --> 00:01:24.417 position:50% align:center
[HOUND DOG]
It's already 9 o'clock!

00:01:24.501 --> 00:01:27.170 position:50% align:center
Students should've cleared
out of the gym by now!

00:01:27.253 --> 00:01:29.255 position:50% align:center
[KIRISHIMA]
Crap. Let's beat it.

00:01:31.132 --> 00:01:34.761 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] No more rehearsing.
Just one more sleep.

00:01:34.844 --> 00:01:38.181 position:50% align:center
Then, at 9AM,
the school festival begins!

00:03:11.691 --> 00:03:13.360 position:50% align:center
Woo! I can't sleep!

00:03:13.443 --> 00:03:15.028 position:50% align:center
Yeah, right? I'm stupid excited!

00:03:15.111 --> 00:03:17.530 position:50% align:center
Not so loud! People
are sleeping upstairs.

00:03:17.614 --> 00:03:20.033 position:50% align:center
I just hope the audience
will be that enthusiastic.

00:03:20.116 --> 00:03:24.496 position:50% align:center
It's probably better if we don't
think about it very much.

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:26.164 position:50% align:center
Being embarrassed.

00:03:26.247 --> 00:03:27.791 position:50% align:center
Worrying what others
are thinking.

00:03:27.874 --> 00:03:31.211 position:50% align:center
That'll kill our vibe.
We should focus on having fun.

00:03:31.294 --> 00:03:32.754 position:50% align:center
That's what really matters.

00:03:32.837 --> 00:03:36.007 position:50% align:center
Yeah, says the girl who was
super scared to front the band!

00:03:36.091 --> 00:03:38.301 position:50% align:center
Well, after what
you've all said.

00:03:38.385 --> 00:03:40.762 position:50% align:center
If I didn't do it,

00:03:40.845 --> 00:03:42.931 position:50% align:center
it wouldn't be rockin' at all.

00:03:43.014 --> 00:03:45.517 position:50% align:center
Shut up, that was a totally
different situation.

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.477 position:50% align:center
What Jiro said is
good advice for more

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:48.687 position:50% align:center
than just the performance.

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:51.439 position:50% align:center
Oui. When you try to
make others feel good,

00:03:51.523 --> 00:03:53.942 position:50% align:center
you end up raising
your own spirits, too.

00:03:54.025 --> 00:03:55.694 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Exactly.

00:03:55.777 --> 00:03:58.113 position:50% align:center
Ah-- This rope is so frayed.

00:03:58.196 --> 00:03:59.364 position:50% align:center
[AOYAMA]
<i>Mon dieu!</i>

00:03:59.447 --> 00:04:01.658 position:50% align:center
We put it through some
abuse during practice.

00:04:01.741 --> 00:04:04.869 position:50% align:center
It's physical proof of
our blossoming friendship!

00:04:04.953 --> 00:04:06.204 position:50% align:center
But it's dangerous.

00:04:06.287 --> 00:04:07.706 position:50% align:center
I should have
noticed this before.

00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:09.624 position:50% align:center
Yaoyorozu will make
you a new one.

00:04:09.708 --> 00:04:10.792 position:50% align:center
And some tea.

00:04:10.875 --> 00:04:13.378 position:50% align:center
Yaomomo is in bed already.

00:04:13.461 --> 00:04:16.131 position:50% align:center
And don't treat her like
your own personal factory.

00:04:16.214 --> 00:04:19.009 position:50% align:center
But people use me as a phone
charger on the regular.

00:04:19.092 --> 00:04:21.386 position:50% align:center
That's 'cause men
get no respect.

00:04:21.469 --> 00:04:23.888 position:50% align:center
Nah. I'll go buy a
new one in the morning.

00:04:23.972 --> 00:04:27.058 position:50% align:center
It's my fault for not noticing.
And this'll work out.

00:04:27.142 --> 00:04:28.977 position:50% align:center
I'm up early for
training anyway.

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:31.980 position:50% align:center
Okay, but the performance
is at 10 tomorrow.

00:04:32.063 --> 00:04:34.190 position:50% align:center
And most places
don't open till 9.

00:04:34.274 --> 00:04:37.235 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] There's a hardware store
about 15 minutes from UA.

00:04:37.318 --> 00:04:40.238 position:50% align:center
That place opens at 8AM,
so I'll hit it up.

00:04:40.321 --> 00:04:42.407 position:50% align:center
[KAMINARI] That's cutting it
pretty close, dude.

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:46.202 position:50% align:center
Well, goodnight. I really
should be getting to sleep.

00:04:46.286 --> 00:04:47.996 position:50% align:center
Before you go,
how about we night owls

00:04:48.079 --> 00:04:50.415 position:50% align:center
make a final promise!
To do our best.

00:04:50.498 --> 00:04:52.459 position:50% align:center
We're gonna pull this off.

00:04:52.542 --> 00:04:54.711 position:50% align:center
And rock everyone at UA!

00:04:54.794 --> 00:04:56.713 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
Yeah!

00:05:03.053 --> 00:05:06.348 position:50% align:center line:10%
[IZUKU] And then, on the day
of the school festival...

00:05:06.431 --> 00:05:08.767 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] Continuous Full Cowling
at eight percent,

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:10.060 position:50% align:center
and then switch to 20 percent

00:05:10.143 --> 00:05:11.936 position:50% align:center
for a single moment
when I flick.

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:13.897 position:50% align:center
[rustling]

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:15.231 position:50% align:center
There you are, Midoriya.

00:05:15.315 --> 00:05:16.232 position:50% align:center
I knew you'd be here!

00:05:16.316 --> 00:05:17.859 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Hatsume, you're so dirty!

00:05:17.942 --> 00:05:20.862 position:50% align:center
[HATSUME giggles] Ignore
the dark circles and grime.

00:05:20.945 --> 00:05:23.990 position:50% align:center
I knew I'd find you training
even though it's the big day.

00:05:24.074 --> 00:05:25.700 position:50% align:center
I got the gloves
you asked for to work,

00:05:25.784 --> 00:05:27.619 position:50% align:center
so I came to deliver
them in person.

00:05:27.702 --> 00:05:29.454 position:50% align:center
Ah, wow, these are so cool!

00:05:29.537 --> 00:05:30.747 position:50% align:center
Thank you so much, though,

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:32.874 position:50% align:center
you could've waited until
after the festival.

00:05:32.957 --> 00:05:35.669 position:50% align:center
[HATSUME] When it's over, I'm
going to sleep for 36 hours!

00:05:35.752 --> 00:05:36.753 position:50% align:center
[ALL MIGHT]
Can I take a look?

00:05:36.836 --> 00:05:38.797 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Of course.

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:41.466 position:50% align:center
[ALL MIGHT] The gear I tried out
was too bulky to be functional,

00:05:41.549 --> 00:05:44.511 position:50% align:center
even though it was for only
20-30 percent of my power.

00:05:44.594 --> 00:05:48.390 position:50% align:center
Support items can be so
compact these days, it's crazy.

00:05:48.473 --> 00:05:49.891 position:50% align:center
The gloves should
also complement

00:05:49.974 --> 00:05:52.102 position:50% align:center
the rest of your costume!
'Cause you see,

00:05:52.185 --> 00:05:55.188 position:50% align:center
a good designer is able to
satisfy the client in one go!

00:05:55.271 --> 00:05:56.981 position:50% align:center
So what do you think of 'em?

00:05:57.065 --> 00:06:00.402 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] I love them.
Seriously, they're awesome.

00:06:00.485 --> 00:06:03.488 position:50% align:center
These should definitely
help with my new moves.

00:06:03.571 --> 00:06:05.490 position:50% align:center
Here's the manual! See ya!

00:06:06.783 --> 00:06:08.910 position:50% align:center
Uh, thanks again.
Good luck today!

00:06:08.993 --> 00:06:11.663 position:50% align:center
How 'bout we give
'em a trial run?

00:06:11.746 --> 00:06:12.914 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Yes, sir!

00:06:17.961 --> 00:06:19.087 position:50% align:center line:10%
[IZUKU]
Not good!

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:20.213 position:50% align:center line:10%
It took a while to get
used to the gloves,

00:06:20.296 --> 00:06:24.217 position:50% align:center line:10%
so I ended up
practicing too long.

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:26.553 position:50% align:center
I was hoping they'd sell rope
at the convenience store,

00:06:26.636 --> 00:06:29.764 position:50% align:center line:10%
but I guess it's more
of a specialty item.

00:06:29.848 --> 00:06:32.392 position:50% align:center line:10%
The clock's ticking.
I need to hurry!

00:06:35.353 --> 00:06:38.565 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] Rope acquired. I should
have time to make it back.

00:06:41.818 --> 00:06:42.902 position:50% align:center
[GENTLE]
Dear me!

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:47.949 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry!

00:06:48.033 --> 00:06:49.451 position:50% align:center
[GENTLE]
Do be careful.

00:06:49.534 --> 00:06:51.870 position:50% align:center
You almost ruined the aftertaste
of the Gold Tips Imperial,

00:06:51.953 --> 00:06:54.831 position:50% align:center
a travesty I would not
be able to ignore.

00:06:54.914 --> 00:06:57.208 position:50% align:center
[GENTLE]
Drat! He caught me off-guard.

00:06:57.292 --> 00:06:59.294 position:50% align:center
Not good. Why did
I open my mouth?

00:06:59.377 --> 00:07:02.589 position:50% align:center
I must avoid all contact
en route to the school.

00:07:02.672 --> 00:07:05.300 position:50% align:center
[GENTLE]
Come, let us go, La Br-- Honey.

00:07:05.383 --> 00:07:08.678 position:50% align:center
[LA BRAVA] Honey? Oh. Yes,
that's me. Honey!

00:07:08.762 --> 00:07:11.431 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Did he say Gold Tips? Right.

00:07:11.514 --> 00:07:14.309 position:50% align:center
The fancy stuff
Yaoyorozu made for us.

00:07:14.392 --> 00:07:16.478 position:50% align:center
Oh. Interesting.

00:07:16.561 --> 00:07:20.648 position:50% align:center
If he just had tea, I guess that
house is some kind of café.

00:07:20.732 --> 00:07:22.192 position:50% align:center
[LA BRAVA]
Gentle?!

00:07:22.275 --> 00:07:25.320 position:50% align:center
[GENTLE laughs] You must be
familiar with Gold Tips Imperial

00:07:25.403 --> 00:07:26.863 position:50% align:center
if you had this realization.

00:07:26.946 --> 00:07:29.783 position:50% align:center
You're obviously a boy
of refined taste!

00:07:29.866 --> 00:07:32.786 position:50% align:center
Always a pleasure to meet
a fellow connoisseur.

00:07:32.869 --> 00:07:34.788 position:50% align:center
Even if you are just a lad.

00:07:34.871 --> 00:07:37.957 position:50% align:center
Um, well. I don't
really know that much.

00:07:38.041 --> 00:07:41.378 position:50% align:center
My friend made that tea
for us recently is all.

00:07:41.461 --> 00:07:44.089 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] I feel like I've
heard this voice before.

00:07:44.172 --> 00:07:48.218 position:50% align:center
[GENTLE] Oh. You undoubtedly
run in high-class circles.

00:07:48.301 --> 00:07:51.721 position:50% align:center
[GENTLE] Which would suggest
he goes to an elite school!

00:07:51.805 --> 00:07:55.767 position:50% align:center
[GENTLE]
I mean, you have a wise friend.

00:07:55.850 --> 00:07:57.352 position:50% align:center
[GENTLE]
Oh, no.

00:07:57.435 --> 00:08:01.439 position:50% align:center
Yes. I'm lucky.
She's my classmate.

00:08:01.523 --> 00:08:02.982 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Wait a minute.

00:08:03.066 --> 00:08:05.318 position:50% align:center
[GENTLE] How delightful
to hear, young man.

00:08:05.402 --> 00:08:08.655 position:50% align:center
[GENTLE]
This child is from UA!

00:08:08.738 --> 00:08:11.116 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
That voice. The tea!

00:08:11.199 --> 00:08:13.827 position:50% align:center
She says it's like super rare.

00:08:13.910 --> 00:08:16.830 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Whoa, really? Thanks, Yaoyorozu!

00:08:16.913 --> 00:08:18.498 position:50% align:center
It smells great!

00:08:20.625 --> 00:08:22.919 position:50% align:center
[GENTLE] Whenever I'm
preparing my personal kettle.

00:08:23.003 --> 00:08:26.381 position:50% align:center
I select a tea that correlates
to the size of my current job.

00:08:26.464 --> 00:08:28.425 position:50% align:center
Be sure to stay tuned in.

00:08:28.508 --> 00:08:30.093 position:50% align:center
My next video will be an alarm.

00:08:30.176 --> 00:08:34.222 position:50% align:center
Not just to my faithful viewers,
but to all of society.

00:08:34.305 --> 00:08:36.641 position:50% align:center
[GENTLE]
Now, if you'll pardon me--

00:08:36.725 --> 00:08:38.601 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
No way.

00:08:38.685 --> 00:08:40.311 position:50% align:center
[GENTLE]
Excitement got the better of me.

00:08:40.395 --> 00:08:42.689 position:50% align:center
Such is the seduction
of fine tea.

00:08:42.772 --> 00:08:44.107 position:50% align:center
Now, a swift exit.

00:08:44.190 --> 00:08:45.859 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Tell me something.

00:08:48.862 --> 00:08:51.031 position:50% align:center
That tea was part
of your ritual, right?

00:08:51.114 --> 00:08:53.450 position:50% align:center
[LA BRAVA] You can't
blame yourself, Gentle!

00:08:53.533 --> 00:08:57.996 position:50% align:center
It couldn't be
helped! And now...

00:08:58.079 --> 00:08:59.914 position:50% align:center
[LA BRAVA, GENTLE]
It's too late.

00:09:02.917 --> 00:09:05.295 position:50% align:center
The second an alarm sounds,

00:09:05.378 --> 00:09:07.422 position:50% align:center
we'll have to shut
down and evacuate.

00:09:07.505 --> 00:09:10.342 position:50% align:center
Those were the terms
the police agreed upon.

00:09:10.425 --> 00:09:11.509 position:50% align:center
[GENTLE]
Ritual?

00:09:11.593 --> 00:09:14.512 position:50% align:center
Whatever do you mean?

00:09:14.596 --> 00:09:16.931 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
I saw your video.

00:09:17.974 --> 00:09:19.184 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Please...

00:09:19.267 --> 00:09:22.645 position:50% align:center
La Brava. It's time
to bring out the camera.

00:09:22.729 --> 00:09:24.522 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
You can't do this.

00:09:28.276 --> 00:09:29.277 position:50% align:center
[ERI]
I can see how hard

00:09:29.361 --> 00:09:31.196 position:50% align:center
everyone is working
on the festival,

00:09:31.279 --> 00:09:34.366 position:50% align:center
and I do wanna know
how it all turns out.

00:09:34.449 --> 00:09:38.161 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] I don't care
what you have planned.

00:09:38.244 --> 00:09:40.580 position:50% align:center
I won't let you near my school!

00:09:54.761 --> 00:09:57.097 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
I won't let you near my school!

00:09:57.180 --> 00:10:00.350 position:50% align:center
Well, aren't you
a perceptive young man?

00:10:00.433 --> 00:10:02.435 position:50% align:center
[LA BRAVA]
Wait. Do I know him?

00:10:02.519 --> 00:10:04.562 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] Saturday morning,
no people around!

00:10:04.646 --> 00:10:07.691 position:50% align:center
No hero agencies near UA,
so I can't expect backup.

00:10:07.774 --> 00:10:10.068 position:50% align:center
And I have no idea
what this guy can do.

00:10:10.151 --> 00:10:12.737 position:50% align:center
If I could ask the café
to call the police--

00:10:14.239 --> 00:10:15.824 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
No!

00:10:15.907 --> 00:10:18.702 position:50% align:center
La Brava, there's been
a slight change of plan.

00:10:18.785 --> 00:10:21.705 position:50% align:center
From this moment on, no matter
what, don't stop filming!

00:10:21.788 --> 00:10:23.915 position:50% align:center
Oh, I'm all over it, Gentle!

00:10:23.998 --> 00:10:26.751 position:50% align:center
But, are you going to fight
on the street? Right here?

00:10:26.835 --> 00:10:29.629 position:50% align:center
What about your master plan?

00:10:29.713 --> 00:10:31.089 position:50% align:center
My dearest viewers!

00:10:31.172 --> 00:10:34.009 position:50% align:center
I believe it's time to give
you a taste of my hijinks!

00:10:35.844 --> 00:10:38.388 position:50% align:center
[GENTLE] Try not to be so
dazzled that you avert your eyes

00:10:38.471 --> 00:10:41.558 position:50% align:center
as your favorite scoundrel
shows off his talents.

00:10:41.641 --> 00:10:44.269 position:50% align:center
Gentle Criminal,
at your service!

00:10:44.352 --> 00:10:46.771 position:50% align:center
My plans have shifted.

00:10:46.855 --> 00:10:48.732 position:50% align:center
Due to our current
predicament, friends,

00:10:48.815 --> 00:10:52.652 position:50% align:center
I'll keep my words brief.
For this caper...

00:10:52.736 --> 00:10:54.904 position:50% align:center
...I will infiltrate UA!

00:10:54.988 --> 00:10:56.031 position:50% align:center
So cool!

00:10:56.114 --> 00:10:58.116 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
So not cool.

00:10:58.199 --> 00:10:59.909 position:50% align:center
I won't let you do that!

00:11:03.455 --> 00:11:06.791 position:50% align:center
I conjured up this barrier
as I cast off my overcoat!

00:11:06.875 --> 00:11:10.337 position:50% align:center
If you've seen my videos,
then you should already know.

00:11:10.420 --> 00:11:12.380 position:50% align:center
My Quirk is Elasticity.

00:11:12.464 --> 00:11:16.009 position:50% align:center
I bestow said property
to anything I touch.

00:11:16.092 --> 00:11:19.637 position:50% align:center
And I do mean anything,
even the air itself.

00:11:19.721 --> 00:11:21.639 position:50% align:center
Gently Rebound!

00:11:23.725 --> 00:11:26.102 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU yelps]

00:11:26.186 --> 00:11:29.397 position:50% align:center
I abhor using violence
to solve my problems.

00:11:29.481 --> 00:11:32.442 position:50% align:center
[LA BRAVA] Yeah, but
that move was intense.

00:11:32.525 --> 00:11:35.070 position:50% align:center
I find myself completely
confounded in this moment,

00:11:35.153 --> 00:11:36.654 position:50% align:center
La Brava darling.

00:11:36.738 --> 00:11:38.365 position:50% align:center
His speed and power
are startling

00:11:38.448 --> 00:11:41.785 position:50% align:center
and unexpected from a boy
so young. Quite odd.

00:11:41.868 --> 00:11:44.788 position:50% align:center
Sorry to cut and run,
but the show must go on!

00:11:44.871 --> 00:11:48.208 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] Don't apologize,
just stay away from my school!

00:11:48.291 --> 00:11:50.919 position:50% align:center
[GENTLE] Clever boy.
But no such luck for you.

00:11:51.002 --> 00:11:52.837 position:50% align:center
Gently... Trampoline!

00:11:52.921 --> 00:11:54.714 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU yelps]

00:11:54.798 --> 00:11:56.383 position:50% align:center
[GENTLE]
When I was a student, I, too,

00:11:56.466 --> 00:11:59.427 position:50% align:center
worked hard to put
on social events.

00:11:59.511 --> 00:12:02.180 position:50% align:center
I'm sure you have feelings
invested in this festival.

00:12:02.263 --> 00:12:03.890 position:50% align:center
But they can't win
against the desires

00:12:03.973 --> 00:12:06.017 position:50% align:center
of my mustache and my soul!

00:12:06.101 --> 00:12:07.811 position:50% align:center
This scheme is a
crucial step toward

00:12:07.894 --> 00:12:09.729 position:50% align:center
my becoming a legend.

00:12:09.813 --> 00:12:12.524 position:50% align:center
Be a dear and stay
out of my way.

00:12:12.607 --> 00:12:15.443 position:50% align:center
Cheerio, lad. Hope you
stick the landing.

00:12:15.527 --> 00:12:17.987 position:50% align:center
Hey, Gentle, I know where
I've seen him before!

00:12:18.071 --> 00:12:20.073 position:50% align:center
That boy is named
Izuku Midoriya!

00:12:20.156 --> 00:12:22.992 position:50% align:center
He broke his fingers on purpose
during the sports festival.

00:12:23.076 --> 00:12:24.452 position:50% align:center
He's totally crazy.

00:12:24.536 --> 00:12:25.620 position:50% align:center
By Jove!

00:12:25.704 --> 00:12:28.289 position:50% align:center
We'd better get out
of here post haste.

00:12:28.373 --> 00:12:32.252 position:50% align:center
We'll carry out the plan before
he's able to alert his peers.

00:12:32.335 --> 00:12:33.712 position:50% align:center line:10%
Hello again, my friends.

00:12:33.795 --> 00:12:36.172 position:50% align:center line:10%
The outrageous scheme that's
currently in progress

00:12:36.256 --> 00:12:39.009 position:50% align:center
has now become a race
against the clock!

00:12:43.430 --> 00:12:46.474 position:50% align:center
Sorry, you two. My break
is almost over. I'm off.

00:12:46.558 --> 00:12:47.934 position:50% align:center
Okay! Just so you know,

00:12:48.018 --> 00:12:50.854 position:50% align:center
I'm lookin' forward to
seeing you get down, too!

00:12:50.937 --> 00:12:54.024 position:50% align:center
Deku, you're leaving already?

00:12:54.107 --> 00:12:56.860 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry. But I have
to go to practice.

00:12:56.943 --> 00:12:58.903 position:50% align:center
[MIRIO] The three of us can
explore the fest as a trio

00:12:58.987 --> 00:13:01.823 position:50% align:center
after Midoriya's done
shakin' his stuff!

00:13:01.906 --> 00:13:05.744 position:50% align:center
[ERI]
Deku. Lemillion.

00:13:05.827 --> 00:13:09.581 position:50% align:center
I'm getting kind of excited.

00:13:11.207 --> 00:13:12.876 position:50% align:center
[GENTLE] I'm sure you
have feelings invested

00:13:12.959 --> 00:13:15.754 position:50% align:center
in this festival. But they
can't win against the desires

00:13:15.837 --> 00:13:18.715 position:50% align:center
of my mustache and my soul!

00:13:18.798 --> 00:13:21.009 position:50% align:center
[JIRO] Midoriya, I know
you're always scribbling

00:13:21.092 --> 00:13:23.094 position:50% align:center
a ton of stuff down
in your notebooks.

00:13:23.178 --> 00:13:24.637 position:50% align:center
So what's it look like in there?

00:13:24.721 --> 00:13:27.098 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] Why, is there a hero
you wanna know more about, Jiro?

00:13:27.182 --> 00:13:30.143 position:50% align:center
[JIRO] No, I just wanted to see
how you organize your notes.

00:13:30.226 --> 00:13:32.854 position:50% align:center
I'm trying to figure out how to
highlight the important stuff.

00:13:32.937 --> 00:13:35.857 position:50% align:center
I write down way too much.
Got any advice?

00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:37.567 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Advice for the band members?

00:13:37.650 --> 00:13:39.152 position:50% align:center
Wow, you came up
with these lessons?

00:13:39.235 --> 00:13:42.405 position:50% align:center
That's awesome!
This makes me so happy!

00:13:42.489 --> 00:13:44.657 position:50% align:center
I hope everyone else
feels the same way.

00:13:44.741 --> 00:13:47.952 position:50% align:center
Since you guys convinced me
my music has a purpose,

00:13:48.036 --> 00:13:50.622 position:50% align:center
I've actually gotten
pretty enthusiastic.

00:13:50.705 --> 00:13:54.501 position:50% align:center
It's possible I went
a little bit overboard.

00:13:54.584 --> 00:13:56.628 position:50% align:center
Tokoyami! I told you.

00:13:56.711 --> 00:13:59.005 position:50% align:center
Strums like your life
depends on it, bird brain!

00:13:59.089 --> 00:14:00.674 position:50% align:center
You think you can
destroy UA's ears

00:14:00.757 --> 00:14:03.927 position:50% align:center
with weak-ass riffs like that?
Where's the grit?

00:14:04.010 --> 00:14:05.679 position:50% align:center
Do you understand
what he wants?

00:14:05.762 --> 00:14:08.306 position:50% align:center
Sort of. Check out lesson three.

00:14:09.307 --> 00:14:11.017 position:50% align:center
[TOKOYAMI]
Hm...

00:14:12.227 --> 00:14:14.396 position:50% align:center
You're done, Gentle Criminal!

00:14:16.314 --> 00:14:18.358 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
I have to stop him!

00:14:18.441 --> 00:14:20.443 position:50% align:center
[ALL MIGHT] It's still hard for
you to shoot consecutively

00:14:20.527 --> 00:14:23.029 position:50% align:center
or while moving around.

00:14:23.113 --> 00:14:24.989 position:50% align:center
I wish I were on the ground.

00:14:25.073 --> 00:14:27.826 position:50% align:center
Gotta calm down.
I'll mess up if I panic.

00:14:27.909 --> 00:14:31.663 position:50% align:center
Can't let them escape.
I need to land. Focus.

00:14:31.746 --> 00:14:34.457 position:50% align:center
No good! You're still not
nailing it down, Midoriya.

00:14:34.541 --> 00:14:39.587 position:50% align:center
As you move, you've gotta stay
focused and in the moment.

00:14:39.671 --> 00:14:42.257 position:50% align:center
So you wanna be able to
direct wind pressure, huh?

00:14:42.340 --> 00:14:44.926 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] Mm-hm. I need more
control over my blasts,

00:14:45.010 --> 00:14:47.721 position:50% align:center
especially if I'll be
fighting in a city.

00:14:47.804 --> 00:14:50.682 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] The more types of
attacks I have, the better.

00:14:50.765 --> 00:14:55.353 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] Let's try this.
Delaware Smash. Air Force!

00:14:57.272 --> 00:15:00.400 position:50% align:center
Gah! Some kind of air cannon?

00:15:00.483 --> 00:15:02.402 position:50% align:center
All right!

00:15:02.485 --> 00:15:03.987 position:50% align:center
[GENTLE]
That's not enough to stop me!

00:15:04.070 --> 00:15:06.656 position:50% align:center
I will not be discouraged!

00:15:09.409 --> 00:15:12.037 position:50% align:center
I won't let you ruin this
for my entire school!

00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:14.456 position:50% align:center
Dear boy, that's not
your decision.

00:15:16.249 --> 00:15:17.751 position:50% align:center
Gentle, no!

00:15:21.713 --> 00:15:24.299 position:50% align:center
Looks like somethin'
fishy's goin' on.

00:15:24.382 --> 00:15:26.926 position:50% align:center
[LA BRAVA]
Nothing to see here, mister!

00:15:27.010 --> 00:15:29.012 position:50% align:center
We're just filming
a little project!

00:15:29.095 --> 00:15:31.806 position:50% align:center
You think you can tell your
neighbors to stay away, too?

00:15:31.890 --> 00:15:34.726 position:50% align:center
This fib's only going
to buy us a little time.

00:15:34.809 --> 00:15:36.227 position:50% align:center
I know you don't wanna hear it,

00:15:36.311 --> 00:15:39.981 position:50% align:center
Gentle, but at this point,
it would be smart to retreat!

00:15:41.566 --> 00:15:43.943 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Thank you, Hatsume!

00:15:44.027 --> 00:15:46.946 position:50% align:center
[HATSUME] Mm-hm! So currently,
you're shooting air forward

00:15:47.030 --> 00:15:48.948 position:50% align:center
in a wide arc that's
hard to control.

00:15:49.032 --> 00:15:50.450 position:50% align:center
What you need is
one of my babies

00:15:50.533 --> 00:15:52.035 position:50% align:center
to help you fire off
bullets of air

00:15:52.118 --> 00:15:54.162 position:50% align:center
so you can hit precise targets!

00:15:54.245 --> 00:15:56.122 position:50% align:center
You've been practicing this
move with your fingers,

00:15:56.206 --> 00:15:57.791 position:50% align:center
but I bet someday you
can incorporate it

00:15:57.874 --> 00:16:00.960 position:50% align:center
into your Shoot Style, too,
using your iron soles!

00:16:05.757 --> 00:16:07.759 position:50% align:center
That's it! Nice work!

00:16:07.842 --> 00:16:09.386 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Thank you, Ashido!

00:16:09.469 --> 00:16:12.389 position:50% align:center
That extra dance practice
is already coming in handy!

00:16:13.807 --> 00:16:15.850 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU pants]
Where is he?

00:16:15.934 --> 00:16:18.812 position:50% align:center
[GENTLE]
What an unexpected turn.

00:16:18.895 --> 00:16:21.231 position:50% align:center
This won't do at all.

00:16:21.314 --> 00:16:22.816 position:50% align:center
However, one must keep
a sense of humor

00:16:22.899 --> 00:16:24.776 position:50% align:center
about such things,
mustn't one? Ha, ha, ha!

00:16:24.859 --> 00:16:26.861 position:50% align:center
Isn't it about time
to drop the act?

00:16:26.945 --> 00:16:29.072 position:50% align:center
My plan will be
a smashing success!

00:16:29.155 --> 00:16:30.365 position:50% align:center
This is but a delay!

00:16:30.448 --> 00:16:33.159 position:50% align:center
Minor setbacks don't
worry a gentleman.

00:16:33.243 --> 00:16:36.913 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] He's not giving up.
The festival's still in danger.

00:16:36.996 --> 00:16:39.833 position:50% align:center
Yes. That is the resolve
of Gentle Criminal!

00:16:39.916 --> 00:16:41.167 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
You're no gentleman!

00:16:41.251 --> 00:16:44.713 position:50% align:center
I know you're planning
to do something to UA.

00:16:44.796 --> 00:16:47.132 position:50% align:center
What do you want with my school?

00:16:48.591 --> 00:16:51.511 position:50% align:center
You'd like to know
my scheme, eh?

00:16:51.594 --> 00:16:53.179 position:50% align:center
When's this gonna be on TV?

00:16:53.263 --> 00:16:54.556 position:50% align:center
What channel?

00:16:54.639 --> 00:16:56.599 position:50% align:center
Ruffian though I may
be, I implore you

00:16:56.683 --> 00:16:58.643 position:50% align:center
not to confuse me with
those foul wretches

00:16:58.727 --> 00:17:00.645 position:50% align:center
from the League of Villains.

00:17:00.729 --> 00:17:03.857 position:50% align:center
[LA BRAVA]
Gentle! My beloved Gentle!

00:17:03.940 --> 00:17:05.859 position:50% align:center
You see, I have no
palate for kidnapping

00:17:05.942 --> 00:17:08.028 position:50% align:center
or murder or any such rubbish.

00:17:08.111 --> 00:17:10.155 position:50% align:center
I simply wish to sneak
into your school festival

00:17:10.238 --> 00:17:13.867 position:50% align:center
so the world knows that I
am indeed a master criminal.

00:17:13.950 --> 00:17:16.661 position:50% align:center
[LA BRAVA]
Please!

00:17:16.745 --> 00:17:18.830 position:50% align:center
Don't let him defeat you!

00:17:18.913 --> 00:17:20.665 position:50% align:center
[GENTLE]
Now, kindly let me go.

00:17:20.749 --> 00:17:22.625 position:50% align:center
[LA BRAVA]
He's pleading for his life!

00:17:22.709 --> 00:17:25.420 position:50% align:center
You have to know the campus
is on an emergency alert.

00:17:25.503 --> 00:17:27.255 position:50% align:center
Someone's bound to catch
you before you sneak in,

00:17:27.339 --> 00:17:29.257 position:50% align:center
which'll set off
all kinds of alarms.

00:17:29.341 --> 00:17:31.301 position:50% align:center
We'll have to notify the police.

00:17:31.384 --> 00:17:32.802 position:50% align:center
The school festival
will be cancelled,

00:17:32.886 --> 00:17:35.347 position:50% align:center
and you'll end up in jail!
So give up now.

00:17:35.430 --> 00:17:37.974 position:50% align:center
Oh-ho. I don't fear
being detected.

00:17:38.058 --> 00:17:40.268 position:50% align:center
My partner has devised
an ingenious way

00:17:40.352 --> 00:17:42.270 position:50% align:center
to disable every
security sensor.

00:17:42.354 --> 00:17:44.606 position:50% align:center
Nothing will be canceled
and my dastardly plan

00:17:44.689 --> 00:17:45.607 position:50% align:center
will be a success.

00:17:45.690 --> 00:17:47.776 position:50% align:center
It's a win-win
situation, my boy!

00:17:47.859 --> 00:17:50.195 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] That's a win for you,
but a disaster for us!

00:17:50.278 --> 00:17:51.196 position:50% align:center
[GENTLE]
Fair enough.

00:17:51.279 --> 00:17:53.448 position:50% align:center
[LA BRAVA]
A rhetorical defeat!

00:17:53.531 --> 00:17:57.327 position:50% align:center
[GENTLE] So, now you're aware
of my nefarious scheme.

00:17:57.410 --> 00:17:58.870 position:50% align:center
It's been lovely
chatting with you.

00:17:58.953 --> 00:18:01.664 position:50% align:center
But I best bid you goodbye
and be on my way.

00:18:01.748 --> 00:18:03.500 position:50% align:center
I've already called
the authorities!

00:18:03.583 --> 00:18:05.043 position:50% align:center
Stay put.

00:18:05.126 --> 00:18:07.712 position:50% align:center
The police and the pro heroes
will be here any minute now.

00:18:07.796 --> 00:18:08.755 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Come on, come on.

00:18:08.838 --> 00:18:10.173 position:50% align:center
Please let this bluff work.

00:18:10.256 --> 00:18:11.675 position:50% align:center
I don't think so.

00:18:11.758 --> 00:18:13.760 position:50% align:center
While the aftertaste
of the tea remains,

00:18:13.843 --> 00:18:16.721 position:50% align:center
I'll make certain you can't
ruin my machinations.

00:18:18.723 --> 00:18:21.059 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] Predict your
opponent's movements, and...

00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:25.897 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
No. I can't. He's too fast!

00:18:30.151 --> 00:18:31.111 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:18:32.028 --> 00:18:33.530 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:18:35.031 --> 00:18:38.743 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] What's happening
to the beams? There he is!

00:18:38.827 --> 00:18:39.994 position:50% align:center
I know your game now,

00:18:40.078 --> 00:18:42.664 position:50% align:center
but I can bounce your
air bullets back easily.

00:18:44.708 --> 00:18:46.126 position:50% align:center
Gentle.

00:18:46.209 --> 00:18:48.628 position:50% align:center
I hate to say it, but maybe
we should head back to base!

00:18:50.296 --> 00:18:53.341 position:50% align:center
[GENTLE]
No, La Brava.

00:18:53.425 --> 00:18:54.634 position:50% align:center
I'll prevail.

00:18:54.718 --> 00:18:56.219 position:50% align:center
Got to catch him!

00:18:57.679 --> 00:18:58.888 position:50% align:center
[GENTLE]
Now, boy.

00:18:58.972 --> 00:19:01.975 position:50% align:center
Do pay close attention
to what I'm about to say.

00:19:02.058 --> 00:19:04.561 position:50% align:center
I can't cancel the
effects of my Quirk.

00:19:04.644 --> 00:19:08.606 position:50% align:center
The things I elasticize return
to normal gradually over time.

00:19:08.690 --> 00:19:11.401 position:50% align:center
Imagine how the structural
integrity of this steel

00:19:11.484 --> 00:19:14.154 position:50% align:center
is affected by this
unnatural bounce.

00:19:14.237 --> 00:19:15.905 position:50% align:center
Oh, and did I mention
that I thought it prudent

00:19:15.989 --> 00:19:19.117 position:50% align:center
to remove the bolts from
the one I'm standing upon?

00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:21.119 position:50% align:center
Just think,
should this beam fall,

00:19:21.202 --> 00:19:23.329 position:50% align:center
the havoc it would
wreak on anything

00:19:23.413 --> 00:19:26.541 position:50% align:center
or any <i>one</i> below.

00:19:26.624 --> 00:19:28.585 position:50% align:center
Somethin's shaking up there.

00:19:28.668 --> 00:19:30.045 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU gasps]

00:19:30.128 --> 00:19:32.922 position:50% align:center
You're a UA student, yes?

00:19:34.299 --> 00:19:36.551 position:50% align:center
[GENTLE]
If someone's in danger...

00:19:37.761 --> 00:19:39.387 position:50% align:center
[GENTLE]
...you'll step in.

00:19:45.018 --> 00:19:46.436 position:50% align:center
Not a murderer, huh?

00:19:46.519 --> 00:19:49.272 position:50% align:center
You just tried to
kill that old guy!

00:19:49.356 --> 00:19:53.568 position:50% align:center
[GENTLE] Not at all. I simply
wanted to keep you occupied.

00:19:53.651 --> 00:19:55.820 position:50% align:center
I planned to bounce the
beam out of the way myself

00:19:55.904 --> 00:19:57.822 position:50% align:center
if you didn't step in
for some reason.

00:19:57.906 --> 00:20:01.493 position:50% align:center
That looks scary.
This must be the big climax!

00:20:01.576 --> 00:20:03.578 position:50% align:center
[GENTLE] I thought you'd
simply rush for the chap.

00:20:03.661 --> 00:20:05.663 position:50% align:center
I see you really do
have frightening levels

00:20:05.747 --> 00:20:07.999 position:50% align:center
of speed and power.

00:20:08.083 --> 00:20:09.793 position:50% align:center
I hate to leave you
under such a strain,

00:20:09.876 --> 00:20:13.546 position:50% align:center
but stay put and bear
the pain patiently.

00:20:13.630 --> 00:20:16.758 position:50% align:center
Help will arrive soon,
and you'll be saved.

00:20:16.841 --> 00:20:19.511 position:50% align:center
I shall be done
filming by that point.

00:20:21.471 --> 00:20:23.056 position:50% align:center
[GENTLE]
Grab hold, La Brava.

00:20:23.139 --> 00:20:24.641 position:50% align:center
[LA BRAVA]
That's harsh, Gentle!

00:20:24.724 --> 00:20:26.142 position:50% align:center
You're playing dirty!

00:20:26.226 --> 00:20:28.353 position:50% align:center
[GENTLE] My partner has
devised an ingenious way

00:20:28.436 --> 00:20:30.313 position:50% align:center
to disable every
security sensor.

00:20:30.397 --> 00:20:33.483 position:50% align:center
I simply wish to sneak
into your school festival.

00:20:33.566 --> 00:20:37.278 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] No. This can't
be how the fight ends.

00:20:39.155 --> 00:20:41.991 position:50% align:center
[KAMINARI] It's almost time!
My nerves are killin' me.

00:20:42.075 --> 00:20:43.451 position:50% align:center
Just take a few deep breaths.

00:20:43.535 --> 00:20:45.370 position:50% align:center
Try to center
yourself, Kaminari.

00:20:45.453 --> 00:20:46.871 position:50% align:center
Are you sweating, Yaomomo?

00:20:46.955 --> 00:20:48.873 position:50% align:center
We went through the trouble
of having shirts made,

00:20:48.957 --> 00:20:50.542 position:50% align:center
so put yours on, Bakugo.

00:20:50.625 --> 00:20:52.669 position:50% align:center
The dance outfits
are super cute!

00:20:52.752 --> 00:20:54.796 position:50% align:center
And all we did was
jazz up some dresses.

00:20:54.879 --> 00:20:56.423 position:50% align:center
If I could de-wrinkle it!

00:20:56.506 --> 00:20:58.633 position:50% align:center
[MINETA]
Still super sexy!

00:20:58.717 --> 00:21:00.260 position:50% align:center
Midoriya isn't here.

00:21:00.343 --> 00:21:02.012 position:50% align:center
He went to buy rope earlier.

00:21:02.095 --> 00:21:03.680 position:50% align:center
But he should be back by now.

00:21:03.763 --> 00:21:04.639 position:50% align:center
Right? It's odd.

00:21:04.723 --> 00:21:06.224 position:50% align:center
He'll be here.

00:21:07.517 --> 00:21:09.561 position:50% align:center
Our timeline has
changed, La Brava,

00:21:09.644 --> 00:21:12.188 position:50% align:center
but if they're on their guard
and I still manage to sneak in,

00:21:12.272 --> 00:21:14.691 position:50% align:center
then I may yet attain
notoriety I seek!

00:21:14.774 --> 00:21:16.985 position:50% align:center
As a man who accomplished
a great feat,

00:21:17.068 --> 00:21:19.529 position:50% align:center
history will remember my name!

00:21:33.251 --> 00:21:35.378 position:50% align:center
He's still fighting?

00:21:35.462 --> 00:21:37.839 position:50% align:center
I see some of you in that boy.

00:21:37.922 --> 00:21:42.552 position:50% align:center
Neither of you are
going to give up!

00:21:42.635 --> 00:21:46.765 position:50% align:center
I think it's time.
Let's use my Quirk!

00:23:28.992 --> 00:23:30.452 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Here's the preview!

00:23:30.535 --> 00:23:32.954 position:50% align:center
The moment Gentle Criminal
sneaks into UA,

00:23:33.038 --> 00:23:35.123 position:50% align:center
the school festival
will be cancelled.

00:23:35.206 --> 00:23:37.459 position:50% align:center
All our hard work will
have been for nothing!

00:23:37.542 --> 00:23:39.419 position:50% align:center
For the sake of
everybody involved,

00:23:39.502 --> 00:23:43.173 position:50% align:center
especially Eri, I have to
stop this eccentric villain!

00:23:43.256 --> 00:23:45.342 position:50% align:center
It's time for me to rely
on my new moves,

00:23:45.425 --> 00:23:47.802 position:50% align:center
and show how much I've learned
from training with All Might.

00:23:47.886 --> 00:23:50.388 position:50% align:center
Next time:
"School Festival Start!"

00:23:50.472 --> 00:23:51.723 position:50% align:center
La Brava's love for Gentle

00:23:51.806 --> 00:23:54.351 position:50% align:center
may be the deciding
factor in this fight!

00:23:54.434 --> 00:23:56.686 position:50% align:center
Go beyond! Plus Ultra!
