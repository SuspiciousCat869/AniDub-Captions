00:16:38.498 --> 00:16:42.252 position:50% align:center
Yeah, sure! Mineta
seems pretty on edge.

00:16:42.335 --> 00:16:44.421 position:50% align:center
[MINETA] Gotta hurry so
I can score goods seats.

00:16:44.504 --> 00:16:47.132 position:50% align:center
I will not miss
the beauty pageant!

00:16:50.510 --> 00:16:52.012 position:50% align:center
[AUDIENCE 86E]
Kendo!

00:16:52.095 --> 00:16:53.638 position:50% align:center
[AUDIENCE 86F] You can take out
the competition with one punch!

00:16:53.722 --> 00:16:54.764 position:50% align:center
[KENDO grunts]

00:16:54.848 --> 00:16:56.182 position:50% align:center
[CROWD cheers]

00:16:56.266 --> 00:16:58.560 position:50% align:center
[MC 86A] She stuns with a
martial arts demonstration

00:16:58.643 --> 00:17:02.230 position:50% align:center
in a gorgeous dress!
Strength and beauty!

00:17:02.313 --> 00:17:04.482 position:50% align:center
[exhales]

00:17:04.566 --> 00:17:07.652 position:50% align:center
[MC 86A] A masterful
demonstration of skill!

00:17:07.736 --> 00:17:10.155 position:50% align:center
[KENRANZAKI] Really?
Is that the best you can do?

00:17:10.238 --> 00:17:12.157 position:50% align:center
I'm almost offended
you'd compete against me

00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:14.367 position:50% align:center
with something so dull!

00:17:14.451 --> 00:17:16.244 position:50% align:center
[MC 86A] It's the
support course third year

00:17:16.327 --> 00:17:18.538 position:50% align:center
and beauty pageant
queen herself!

00:17:18.621 --> 00:17:21.332 position:50% align:center
Prepare yourselves for
a stunning performance!

00:17:21.416 --> 00:17:23.710 position:50% align:center
[ERI]
What kind of dance is she doing?

00:17:23.793 --> 00:17:25.712 position:50% align:center
[MIRIO] Maybe I'm not the person
to ask about these things

00:17:25.795 --> 00:17:27.464 position:50% align:center
'cause I'm totally lost.

00:17:27.547 --> 00:17:30.592 position:50% align:center
The goal of beauty is to leave
your audience dazzled!

00:17:30.675 --> 00:17:32.093 position:50% align:center
[KENRANZAKI laughs]

00:17:32.177 --> 00:17:34.179 position:50% align:center
[MONOMA]
Oh, man. This third year.

00:17:34.262 --> 00:17:35.805 position:50% align:center
Gotta admit. She's good.

00:17:35.889 --> 00:17:37.349 position:50% align:center
Heard your play
thing went well.

00:17:37.432 --> 00:17:38.183 position:50% align:center
Nice goin', man!

00:17:38.266 --> 00:17:39.434 position:50% align:center
You too, bro.

00:17:39.517 --> 00:17:42.687 position:50% align:center
[MC 86A] Next, another
third year. Nejire Hado!

00:17:42.771 --> 00:17:45.190 position:50% align:center
[CROWD cheers]

00:17:45.273 --> 00:17:46.316 position:50% align:center
Nejire!

00:17:46.399 --> 00:17:49.486 position:50% align:center
You've got this.
People are animals.

00:17:49.569 --> 00:17:52.405 position:50% align:center
Imagine we're puppies and
you'll feel more relaxed.

00:17:52.489 --> 00:17:54.199 position:50% align:center
[YUYU] Nejire lost last
year because she tried

00:17:54.282 --> 00:17:56.201 position:50% align:center
to be flashier than Kenranzaki.

00:17:56.284 --> 00:17:58.119 position:50% align:center
Sure, nobody's gonna
out-dazzle that girl.

00:17:58.203 --> 00:18:00.372 position:50% align:center
But Nejire has
her own strengths!

00:18:03.249 --> 00:18:06.920 position:50% align:center
[HADO] Aw! It's Uraraka!
And Tsu, too!

00:18:07.003 --> 00:18:08.338 position:50% align:center
[giggles]

00:18:10.090 --> 00:18:14.427 position:50% align:center
[HADO] Togata and Eri!
Everyone looks so surprised.

00:18:14.511 --> 00:18:17.514 position:50% align:center
This is so wild.

00:18:17.597 --> 00:18:19.224 position:50% align:center
[AMAJIKI]
Seeing her up there.

00:18:19.307 --> 00:18:21.976 position:50% align:center
It's really something else.

00:18:22.060 --> 00:18:24.979 position:50% align:center
Hado looks like a
fairy or something.

00:18:27.065 --> 00:18:29.484 position:50% align:center
[KENDO]
So pretty.

00:18:32.112 --> 00:18:33.947 position:50% align:center
[MC 86A]
What a magical air dance!

00:18:34.030 --> 00:18:37.617 position:50% align:center
And I think the audience agrees!

00:18:37.701 --> 00:18:40.286 position:50% align:center
Please vote for one of
these eight contestants!

00:18:40.370 --> 00:18:43.039 position:50% align:center
Results will be
announced at 5PM.

00:18:43.123 --> 00:18:44.874 position:50% align:center
[MONOMA]
Kendo from Class B!

00:18:44.958 --> 00:18:47.085 position:50% align:center
A vote for her is
a vote for the future!

00:18:47.168 --> 00:18:48.378 position:50% align:center
[YOSETSU] You're gonna
get her disqualified!

00:18:48.461 --> 00:18:50.463 position:50% align:center
Aw, yeah man! Tonight's
gonna be so great!

00:18:50.547 --> 00:18:52.799 position:50% align:center
Class C's haunted
maze looks crazy!

00:18:52.882 --> 00:18:54.676 position:50% align:center
--Wanna go?
--[ASHIDO] Obvi!

00:18:54.759 --> 00:18:55.802 position:50% align:center
Yeah, no, I'll pass.

00:18:55.885 --> 00:18:57.178 position:50% align:center
There's an obstacle course!

00:18:57.262 --> 00:18:58.430 position:50% align:center
And crepes!

00:18:58.513 --> 00:19:00.557 position:50% align:center
We've still got lots
to see, you guys!

00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:01.725 position:50% align:center
Yay!

00:19:38.178 --> 00:19:39.554 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Thanks for coming today!

00:19:39.637 --> 00:19:41.222 position:50% align:center
I loved it.

00:19:49.814 --> 00:19:51.941 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
One more thing.

00:19:52.025 --> 00:19:53.568 position:50% align:center
Got a surprise for ya!

00:19:53.651 --> 00:19:57.364 position:50% align:center
A candy apple! From where!
I couldn't find any.

00:19:57.447 --> 00:19:59.074 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] Yeah, I didn't see
that anyone was gonna

00:19:59.157 --> 00:20:01.242 position:50% align:center
be selling them,
so I bought ingredients

00:20:01.326 --> 00:20:02.619 position:50% align:center
when I went out this morning.

00:20:02.702 --> 00:20:04.871 position:50% align:center
It was easier to make
than I thought it'd be.

00:20:04.954 --> 00:20:07.374 position:50% align:center
The only thing I couldn't get
at the store was food coloring,

00:20:07.457 --> 00:20:09.542 position:50% align:center
but Sato had plenty.

00:20:09.626 --> 00:20:10.960 position:50% align:center
[AIZAWA]
It's getting late.

00:20:11.044 --> 00:20:14.005 position:50% align:center
But you two should be able
to see her again soon.

00:20:18.385 --> 00:20:21.179 position:50% align:center
It's the best thing ever!

00:20:21.262 --> 00:20:24.265 position:50% align:center
[laughs] I'll make them again.

00:20:24.349 --> 00:20:26.518 position:50% align:center
So you have something
to look forward to!

00:20:26.601 --> 00:20:27.936 position:50% align:center
[ERI]
I will!

00:22:01.488 --> 00:22:03.239 position:50% align:center
[DETECTIVE 86A]
You're self-taught?

00:22:03.323 --> 00:22:04.616 position:50% align:center
[LA BRAVA]
Yes.

00:22:04.699 --> 00:22:06.701 position:50% align:center
[DETECTIVE 86A] I can't
believe it! What's your job?

00:22:06.785 --> 00:22:08.036 position:50% align:center
La Brava.

00:22:08.119 --> 00:22:09.454 position:50% align:center
[DETECTIVE 86A] Wouldn't
you rather use this talent

00:22:09.537 --> 00:22:10.830 position:50% align:center
for the good of the world?

00:22:10.914 --> 00:22:12.540 position:50% align:center
'Fraid not.

00:22:12.624 --> 00:22:17.253 position:50% align:center
I only care about helping my
Gentle in any way that I can.

00:22:17.337 --> 00:22:18.922 position:50% align:center
[GORILLA DETECTIVE] You know
it's fairly easy to test

00:22:19.005 --> 00:22:21.257 position:50% align:center
whether or not someone
has been brainwashed.

00:22:21.341 --> 00:22:23.176 position:50% align:center
So why don't you
stop lying to us?

00:22:23.259 --> 00:22:26.304 position:50% align:center
It's obvious the girl in there
really has feelings for you.

00:22:26.388 --> 00:22:29.099 position:50% align:center
And it's true you've failed
plenty, but as for the crimes

00:22:29.182 --> 00:22:31.309 position:50% align:center
you did manage to commit,
both you and the girl--

00:22:31.393 --> 00:22:34.521 position:50% align:center
I made certain that Aiba
was never directly involved.

00:22:34.604 --> 00:22:37.982 position:50% align:center
You can't blame us
equally for my schemes.

00:22:38.066 --> 00:22:40.944 position:50% align:center
[GORILLA DETECTIVE]
Hm. So, the feelings are mutual.

00:22:41.027 --> 00:22:44.072 position:50% align:center
Well whaddaya know.

00:22:44.155 --> 00:22:46.950 position:50% align:center
Former hero course
student. Dropout.

00:22:47.033 --> 00:22:50.078 position:50% align:center
The world twisted you until
streaming videos of crime

00:22:50.161 --> 00:22:51.538 position:50% align:center
seemed your only path.

00:22:51.621 --> 00:22:54.249 position:50% align:center
[GENTLE] It was always
in service of my dream.

00:22:54.332 --> 00:22:57.794 position:50% align:center
Even if I erred when
choosing my path.

00:22:57.877 --> 00:22:58.920 position:50% align:center
[GORILLA DETECTIVE]
Then, it's a good thing

00:22:59.004 --> 00:23:03.299 position:50% align:center
you turned yourself in today.

00:23:03.383 --> 00:23:06.970 position:50% align:center
Some people will tell you that
there are no do-overs in life.

00:23:07.053 --> 00:23:09.639 position:50% align:center
But that's for those
who don't want to change,

00:23:09.723 --> 00:23:13.268 position:50% align:center
or are too impatient and
want immediate results.

00:23:14.269 --> 00:23:19.816 position:50% align:center
[GENTLE sobbing]

00:23:19.899 --> 00:23:23.945 position:50% align:center
Hey, you want some tea?

00:23:24.029 --> 00:23:25.488 position:50% align:center
Earl Grey please.

00:23:25.572 --> 00:23:27.449 position:50% align:center
[GORILLA DETECTIVE]
You'll get whatever we have.

00:23:29.492 --> 00:23:31.202 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Here's the preview!

00:23:31.286 --> 00:23:33.663 position:50% align:center
The Japanese Hero
Billboard Chart!

00:23:33.747 --> 00:23:35.832 position:50% align:center
It's a ranking of active
heroes based on the cases

00:23:35.915 --> 00:23:38.877 position:50% align:center
they've resolved, their service
to society, how much citizens

00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:41.963 position:50% align:center
support them, and other
factors all weighed together.

00:23:42.047 --> 00:23:43.298 position:50% align:center
Now that All Might's retired,

00:23:43.381 --> 00:23:45.759 position:50% align:center
the rankings are
fluctuating wildly.

00:23:45.842 --> 00:23:49.429 position:50% align:center
And now, we have
a new number one!

00:23:49.512 --> 00:23:52.474 position:50% align:center
Next time: "Japanese
Hero Billboard Chart."

00:23:52.557 --> 00:23:55.226 position:50% align:center
The Wing Hero: Hawks flies
in to make an appearance!

00:23:55.310 --> 00:23:57.687 position:50% align:center
Go beyond! Plus Ultra!
