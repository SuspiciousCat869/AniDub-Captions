reason. So what is it?

00:09:09.299 --> 00:09:11.009 position:50% align:center
[GANG ORCA] "Work together
and win the hearts

00:09:11.092 --> 00:09:13.261 position:50% align:center
of those children."

00:09:13.345 --> 00:09:15.013 position:50% align:center
You did a good job
despite having

00:09:15.096 --> 00:09:16.765 position:50% align:center
such vague instructions.

00:09:16.848 --> 00:09:19.351 position:50% align:center
[KATSUKI, YOARASHI] Wait,
so you did that on purpose?

00:09:19.434 --> 00:09:21.978 position:50% align:center
[GANG ORCA]
The rest of you also did well.

00:09:22.062 --> 00:09:24.230 position:50% align:center
Remember everything
you learned today.

00:09:24.314 --> 00:09:25.565 position:50% align:center
And keep working.

00:09:25.648 --> 00:09:28.985 position:50% align:center
You students have so
much potential--uh...

00:09:29.069 --> 00:09:30.695 position:50% align:center
I mean, don't you dare fail!

00:09:30.779 --> 00:09:32.322 position:50% align:center
[TRAINEES]
Sir, yes, sir!

00:09:32.405 --> 00:09:34.824 position:50% align:center
He's actually a big
softy who loves kids.

00:09:34.908 --> 00:09:36.951 position:50% align:center
This is just for show.

00:09:39.454 --> 00:09:40.997 position:50% align:center
After what we put
together in there,

00:09:41.081 --> 00:09:43.249 position:50% align:center
I think we're meant
to be friends, don't you?

00:09:43.333 --> 00:09:45.335 position:50% align:center
Our Quirks just work
so well together.

00:09:45.418 --> 00:09:46.503 position:50% align:center
You think so?

00:09:46.586 --> 00:09:48.588 position:50% align:center
Yeah, and Bakugo,
you're actually not bad

00:09:48.672 --> 00:09:50.590 position:50% align:center
if you don't talk.
Try shutting up!

00:09:50.674 --> 00:09:53.009 position:50% align:center
You shut up!

00:09:53.093 --> 00:09:54.260 position:50% align:center
[ALL MIGHT]
Sounds good.

00:09:54.344 --> 00:09:55.095 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:09:55.178 --> 00:09:56.304 position:50% align:center
[YOARASHI gasps]

00:09:56.388 --> 00:09:58.390 position:50% align:center
We'll also do whatever
we can to help you.

00:09:58.473 --> 00:10:00.600 position:50% align:center
[CAMIE] Ooh, what's
going on, Shishikura?

00:10:00.684 --> 00:10:02.268 position:50% align:center
You schmoozing with All Might?

00:10:02.352 --> 00:10:04.813 position:50% align:center
Seriously, the Symbol?
What were you talking about?

00:10:04.896 --> 00:10:06.231 position:50% align:center
Like, Hero stuff or what?

00:10:06.314 --> 00:10:08.483 position:50% align:center
We were talking about you. Fool!

00:10:08.566 --> 00:10:10.443 position:50% align:center
For realzies? That's sweet.

00:10:10.527 --> 00:10:12.404 position:50% align:center
The reality is that,
by attacking you,

00:10:12.487 --> 00:10:15.073 position:50% align:center
the League went after
a school other than UA.

00:10:15.156 --> 00:10:16.908 position:50% align:center
Up until now,
our schools haven't

00:10:16.991 --> 00:10:19.994 position:50% align:center
had an especially close
relationship with each other.

00:10:20.078 --> 00:10:22.247 position:50% align:center
But we were talking about
coordinating in the future

00:10:22.330 --> 00:10:25.208 position:50% align:center
for the sake of
sharing information.

00:10:25.291 --> 00:10:28.211 position:50% align:center
We still don't know why you
were targeted, Miss Utsushimi.

00:10:28.294 --> 00:10:30.296 position:50% align:center
But hopefully, together,
we'll get a better idea

00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:31.673 position:50% align:center
of what the villains want.

00:10:31.756 --> 00:10:32.757 position:50% align:center
Cray-cray.

00:10:32.841 --> 00:10:34.634 position:50% align:center
Additionally, this means
we can organize

00:10:34.718 --> 00:10:36.594 position:50% align:center
joint training
exercises someday.

00:10:36.678 --> 00:10:38.722 position:50% align:center
[KATSUKI] Next time,
I'll beat you up one-on-one.

00:10:38.805 --> 00:10:39.931 position:50% align:center
You still behave and speak

00:10:40.015 --> 00:10:41.808 position:50% align:center
like a back-alley
thug, you hoodlum!

00:10:41.891 --> 00:10:43.351 position:50% align:center
Remember your place!

00:10:43.435 --> 00:10:46.479 position:50% align:center
Yeah, you don't get to be
the one to tell me that.

00:10:46.563 --> 00:10:50.191 position:50% align:center
[ENDEAVOR]
Shoto. Long time no see.

00:10:50.275 --> 00:10:51.568 position:50% align:center
You've changed quite a bit.

00:10:51.651 --> 00:10:53.319 position:50% align:center
Not interested.

00:10:55.989 --> 00:10:57.532 position:50% align:center
[ENDEAVOR]
Shoto...

00:11:01.786 --> 00:11:04.622 position:50% align:center
I want you to know
I'm proud of you, son.

00:11:06.207 --> 00:11:08.084 position:50% align:center
[ENDEAVOR]
Because of that,

00:11:08.168 --> 00:11:12.672 position:50% align:center
I swear I'll become someone
you can be proud of, too.

00:11:12.756 --> 00:11:15.592 position:50% align:center
Not just as the number-one hero,

00:11:15.675 --> 00:11:18.720 position:50% align:center
but as the man that
you call father.

00:11:21.556 --> 00:11:23.767 position:50% align:center
I don't care what you do.

00:11:28.188 --> 00:11:31.274 position:50% align:center
[YOARASHI]
Endeavor! Just so you know,

00:11:31.358 --> 00:11:33.610 position:50% align:center
I'll be rooting for you!

00:11:33.693 --> 00:11:37.947 position:50% align:center
Thanks a lot.
Also, you're bleeding.

00:11:39.783 --> 00:11:41.576 position:50% align:center
[ALL MIGHT]
Progress is slow.

00:11:41.659 --> 00:11:43.036 position:50% align:center
For Endeavor.

00:11:43.119 --> 00:11:45.830 position:50% align:center
For these aspiring heroes.

00:11:45.914 --> 00:11:48.708 position:50% align:center
Sometimes they come
to a standstill.

00:11:48.792 --> 00:11:52.837 position:50% align:center
Sometimes they have
to look behind them.

00:11:52.921 --> 00:11:56.299 position:50% align:center
But, one step in
front of the other,

00:11:56.383 --> 00:11:58.385 position:50% align:center
they keep moving forward.

00:12:08.478 --> 00:12:11.189 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] Before we knew it,
September was over,

00:12:11.272 --> 00:12:13.608 position:50% align:center
and fall was upon us.

00:12:13.692 --> 00:12:16.403 position:50% align:center
As the air outside
began to grow colder,

00:12:16.486 --> 00:12:17.570 position:50% align:center
we tried to come to terms

00:12:17.654 --> 00:12:19.739 position:50% align:center
with everything
we'd been through.

00:12:21.783 --> 00:12:23.785 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] All Might and
Mr. Aizawa took those of us

00:12:23.868 --> 00:12:25.829 position:50% align:center
who were involved in
the Shie Hassaikai raid

00:12:25.912 --> 00:12:28.039 position:50% align:center
to Sir Nighteye's funeral.

00:12:28.123 --> 00:12:31.042 position:50% align:center
It was one last chance
to say goodbye to him.

00:12:34.129 --> 00:12:35.588 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] Our teachers
and the hero agencies

00:12:35.672 --> 00:12:37.757 position:50% align:center
talked about the
work studies program.

00:12:37.841 --> 00:12:41.553 position:50% align:center
And they decided it would
be best to put them on hold.

00:12:41.636 --> 00:12:44.931 position:50% align:center
Nighteye's sidekick, Centipeder,
took over his agency.

00:12:45.015 --> 00:12:46.599 position:50% align:center
He and Bubble Girl
eagerly awaiting

00:12:46.683 --> 00:12:49.060 position:50% align:center
Togata's return to their ranks.

00:12:51.521 --> 00:12:52.814 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
As for Eri...

00:12:52.897 --> 00:12:55.275 position:50% align:center
She regained consciousness
and recovered,

00:12:55.358 --> 00:12:57.652 position:50% align:center
but she was still emotionally
unstable and her Quirk

00:12:57.736 --> 00:12:59.571 position:50% align:center
could go out of
control at any time,

00:12:59.654 --> 00:13:01.239 position:50% align:center
so the hospital had
to take precautions,

00:13:01.322 --> 00:13:03.491 position:50% align:center
and she couldn't have visitors.

00:13:04.951 --> 00:13:06.828 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
There was some progress, though.

00:13:06.911 --> 00:13:08.830 position:50% align:center
The doctors discovered
that the horn on her forehead

00:13:08.913 --> 00:13:10.915 position:50% align:center
seemed to power
her Rewind Quirk.

00:13:10.999 --> 00:13:14.961 position:50% align:center
As her fever went down,
it began to shrink.

00:13:15.045 --> 00:13:16.713 position:50% align:center
Now it's little
more than a bump.

00:13:16.796 --> 00:13:18.214 position:50% align:center
Which is a good sign.

00:13:19.924 --> 00:13:23.219 position:50% align:center
[ECTOPLASM] The equation isn't
that difficult to solve.

00:13:23.303 --> 00:13:25.889 position:50% align:center
Calculate the definite integral.

00:13:25.972 --> 00:13:28.683 position:50% align:center
When you have an answer,
raise your hand.

00:13:28.767 --> 00:13:31.227 position:50% align:center
[JIRO] Mr. Ectoplasm
always gets so hardcore

00:13:31.311 --> 00:13:33.063 position:50% align:center
with this kind of stuff.

00:13:33.146 --> 00:13:36.191 position:50% align:center
Start by carrying the yay.

00:13:36.274 --> 00:13:37.817 position:50% align:center
[TOKOYAMI]
Even Yaoyorozu is puzzled,

00:13:37.901 --> 00:13:39.778 position:50% align:center
and she's at the
top of our class.

00:13:39.861 --> 00:13:42.447 position:50% align:center
Mathematics is truly
a cursed subject.

00:13:43.448 --> 00:13:45.950 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU growling]

00:13:47.202 --> 00:13:48.244 position:50% align:center
[ECTOPLASM]
Midoriya!

00:13:48.328 --> 00:13:49.996 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
107/14.

00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:52.457 position:50% align:center
[ECTOPLASM]
Incorrect! Yaoyorozu!

00:13:52.540 --> 00:13:54.376 position:50% align:center
[YAOYOROZU]
107/28.

00:13:54.459 --> 00:13:58.922 position:50% align:center
[ECTOPLASM] That's right!
Onto the next problem.

00:13:59.005 --> 00:14:02.592 position:50% align:center
That was almost smart.
Too bad you screwed up.

00:14:04.844 --> 00:14:07.013 position:50% align:center
You seemed really
into that class, Deku.

00:14:07.097 --> 00:14:08.473 position:50% align:center
Yes! I applaud the
effort you're putting

00:14:08.556 --> 00:14:10.266 position:50% align:center
into your studies! However,

00:14:10.350 --> 00:14:13.228 position:50% align:center
before we feed our brains,
we need to feed our bodies!

00:14:13.311 --> 00:14:15.647 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Mm-hm! I'm starvi--

00:14:15.730 --> 00:14:18.233 position:50% align:center
Please. Have some fromage.

00:14:20.110 --> 00:14:22.487 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] Aoyama was
force-feeding me cheese.

00:14:22.570 --> 00:14:24.155 position:50% align:center
And little did I know,

00:14:24.239 --> 00:14:27.033 position:50% align:center
even stranger things
were in my future.

00:14:28.076 --> 00:14:30.286 position:50% align:center
Where'd you even come from?!

00:14:30.370 --> 00:14:31.663 position:50% align:center
Thank you.

00:14:31.746 --> 00:14:32.831 position:50% align:center
This cheese is
called <i>Pont-l'Éveque</i> .

00:14:32.914 --> 00:14:35.000 position:50% align:center
It's mild and perfect
for snacking.

00:14:35.083 --> 00:14:37.043 position:50% align:center
Oh! I'm good, still
chewin' on the piece

00:14:37.127 --> 00:14:38.211 position:50% align:center
I already have in my mouth,

00:14:38.294 --> 00:14:39.713 position:50% align:center
uh, but thanks anyway.

00:14:39.796 --> 00:14:41.172 position:50% align:center
Why don't you come
have lunch with us

00:14:41.256 --> 00:14:43.049 position:50% align:center
in the cafeteria?
I've noticed you usually

00:14:43.133 --> 00:14:44.551 position:50% align:center
eat by yourself, Aoyama.

00:14:44.634 --> 00:14:47.095 position:50% align:center
Non! Lunch Rush's
food doesn't agree

00:14:47.178 --> 00:14:48.722 position:50% align:center
with my refined palate.

00:14:50.432 --> 00:14:52.058 position:50% align:center
Well, to each
their own, I suppose.

00:14:52.142 --> 00:14:53.935 position:50% align:center
We're not going force you.

00:14:54.019 --> 00:14:55.770 position:50% align:center
Now. Time to eat.

00:14:55.854 --> 00:14:57.188 position:50% align:center
[footsteps]

00:14:57.272 --> 00:15:00.233 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
That was just the beginning.

00:15:00.316 --> 00:15:02.027 position:50% align:center
Aoyama definitely made an impact

00:15:02.110 --> 00:15:05.280 position:50% align:center
anytime he spoke or...
did anything, really.

00:15:05.363 --> 00:15:06.740 position:50% align:center
But it was always
pretty hard to tell

00:15:06.823 --> 00:15:08.491 position:50% align:center
what he was thinking.

00:15:25.592 --> 00:15:30.055 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] But at last, he was
showing his true colors.

00:15:49.366 --> 00:15:50.450 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:15:50.533 --> 00:15:52.243 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
What the heck is going on?

00:15:52.327 --> 00:15:56.331 position:50% align:center
That was Aoyama, right?
But why was he on the balcony?

00:15:56.414 --> 00:15:58.750 position:50% align:center
He was just standing
there, staring.

00:15:58.833 --> 00:16:00.210 position:50% align:center
I didn't imagine that, right?

00:16:00.293 --> 00:16:01.294 position:50% align:center
What should I do?

00:16:01.378 --> 00:16:02.712 position:50% align:center
I mean, his room is next door,

00:16:02.796 --> 00:16:03.797 position:50% align:center
so he could've
walked down the hall

00:16:03.880 --> 00:16:05.173 position:50% align:center
if he needed something.

00:16:05.256 --> 00:16:07.550 position:50% align:center
Should I go talk to him?
What would I even say?

00:16:07.634 --> 00:16:10.428 position:50% align:center
"Hey, Aoyama, were you
just being creepy?"

00:16:10.512 --> 00:16:15.100 position:50% align:center
No. Calm down. I'm sure
there's a logical--

00:16:18.311 --> 00:16:20.814 position:50% align:center
[AOYAMA]
Midoriya. I know.

00:16:22.607 --> 00:16:24.526 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Cheese!

00:16:25.944 --> 00:16:27.404 position:50% align:center
[TENYA]
Do not run in the hall!

00:16:27.487 --> 00:16:30.782 position:50% align:center
But do move your legs
as quickly as possible!

00:16:30.865 --> 00:16:32.659 position:50% align:center
--[OCHACO] And safe! Whew!
--Only one minute to class!

00:16:32.742 --> 00:16:34.285 position:50% align:center
You barely made it.

00:16:34.369 --> 00:16:36.079 position:50% align:center
And are you getting
enough sleep lately?

00:16:36.162 --> 00:16:37.706 position:50% align:center
I see those dark circles.

00:16:37.789 --> 00:16:40.333 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
You're right. Sorry, Class Rep!

00:16:44.421 --> 00:16:46.464 position:50% align:center
Surprise.

00:16:46.548 --> 00:16:47.924 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
There he was.

00:16:48.008 --> 00:16:49.759 position:50% align:center
I was so weirded out
by the cheese last night,

00:16:49.843 --> 00:16:51.886 position:50% align:center
I couldn't sleep.

00:16:51.970 --> 00:16:54.097 position:50% align:center
I've never really talked
to Aoyama that much.

00:16:54.180 --> 00:16:56.266 position:50% align:center
He doesn't go out of
his way to socialize.

00:16:56.349 --> 00:16:57.809 position:50% align:center
He's more of a free spirit.

00:16:57.892 --> 00:17:00.729 position:50% align:center
Someone who says
whatever's on his mind.

00:17:00.812 --> 00:17:02.939 position:50% align:center
At least, I think that's right.

00:17:03.023 --> 00:17:05.817 position:50% align:center
I wonder if something's
going on with him.

00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:08.445 position:50% align:center
If so, it's probably not
a good idea to ask him

00:17:08.528 --> 00:17:10.363 position:50% align:center
while everyone else is around.

00:17:10.447 --> 00:17:12.115 position:50% align:center
I don't wanna make
him feel awkward,

00:17:12.198 --> 00:17:14.743 position:50% align:center
especially if it ends up
being something personal.

00:17:14.826 --> 00:17:16.202 position:50% align:center
Hey, whoa, Mineta!

00:17:16.286 --> 00:17:17.328 position:50% align:center
Take a look at this.

00:17:17.412 --> 00:17:18.329 position:50% align:center
Is it X-Rated?

00:17:18.413 --> 00:17:20.165 position:50% align:center
Suitable for children.

00:17:20.248 --> 00:17:22.459 position:50% align:center
Mt. Lady and Edgeshot
have teamed up!

00:17:22.542 --> 00:17:24.836 position:50% align:center
Kamui Woods is gonna
be joining 'em, too!

00:17:24.919 --> 00:17:26.087 position:50% align:center
Mt. Lady.

00:17:26.171 --> 00:17:28.214 position:50% align:center
So big. So hot.

00:17:28.298 --> 00:17:30.175 position:50% align:center
I think they're going
by "Team Lurkers."

00:17:30.258 --> 00:17:32.302 position:50% align:center
I saw it mentioned
in the news earlier.

00:17:32.385 --> 00:17:33.678 position:50% align:center
[KAMINARI]
There sure are a buncha heroes

00:17:33.762 --> 00:17:34.971 position:50% align:center
teaming up these days.

00:17:35.055 --> 00:17:37.474 position:50% align:center
My sexy giantess
is getting famous.

00:17:37.557 --> 00:17:40.310 position:50% align:center
Once we're pros, we should
do some team-ups, too!

00:17:40.393 --> 00:17:42.812 position:50% align:center
Here's an idea!
You can make me float,

00:17:42.896 --> 00:17:44.230 position:50% align:center
and we can make acid rain!

00:17:44.314 --> 00:17:45.648 position:50% align:center
Sounds intense.

00:17:45.732 --> 00:17:48.234 position:50% align:center
Ooh, hey, and Sero can use
his tape to fly me around.

00:17:48.318 --> 00:17:50.487 position:50% align:center
Huh? What're you talkin' about?

00:17:50.570 --> 00:17:52.739 position:50% align:center
[ASHIDO] Koda and Shoji
and Jiro will be the scouts.

00:17:52.822 --> 00:17:55.408 position:50% align:center
Oh, oh! We'll be called
"Team Rainy Day"!

00:17:55.492 --> 00:17:56.409 position:50% align:center
Woo-hoo.

00:17:56.493 --> 00:17:57.494 position:50% align:center
[MINETA, KAMINARI]
What about us?

00:17:57.577 --> 00:17:58.912 position:50% align:center
[ASHIDO]
Don't need you!

00:17:58.995 --> 00:18:01.164 position:50% align:center
You can't just look at Quirks
when you're teaming up.

00:18:01.247 --> 00:18:03.458 position:50% align:center
You have to choose people
you get along with, too.

00:18:03.541 --> 00:18:05.502 position:50% align:center
[HAGAKURE]
I think you're making it worse.

00:18:05.585 --> 00:18:07.629 position:50% align:center
Everyone should be moving
toward the gym now!

00:18:07.712 --> 00:18:10.131 position:50% align:center
Get yourselves
into your costumes!

00:18:10.215 --> 00:18:11.591 position:50% align:center
[CEMENTOS]
All right, class.

00:18:11.675 --> 00:18:14.636 position:50% align:center
Today we'll continue working
on your "ultimate" moves.

00:18:14.719 --> 00:18:16.388 position:50% align:center
If you haven't found
a second ability,

00:18:16.471 --> 00:18:19.349 position:50% align:center
focus on finding one.
If you already have two,

00:18:19.432 --> 00:18:22.686 position:50% align:center
then work on refining them
until they're flawless.

00:18:22.769 --> 00:18:24.312 position:50% align:center
[KIRISHIMA]
Unbreakable!

00:18:24.396 --> 00:18:25.605 position:50% align:center
Ooh!

00:18:25.689 --> 00:18:27.190 position:50% align:center
[KIRISHIMA]
Just you wait, Rappa.

00:18:27.273 --> 00:18:29.025 position:50% align:center
I'll become a man
who doesn't flinch

00:18:29.109 --> 00:18:30.819 position:50% align:center
at the sight of
someone like you!

00:18:30.902 --> 00:18:35.365 position:50% align:center
I'll train by taking continuous,
powerful hits like yours. So...

00:18:35.448 --> 00:18:37.450 position:50% align:center
[KIRISHIMA]
Bakugo, Sato, Midoriya!

00:18:37.534 --> 00:18:40.036 position:50% align:center
Please use me as your own
personal punching bag!

00:18:40.120 --> 00:18:41.538 position:50% align:center
Dude that sounds super weird.

00:18:41.621 --> 00:18:43.707 position:50% align:center
Sorry, doing some
solo work today.

00:18:43.790 --> 00:18:45.500 position:50% align:center
That's okay.

00:18:45.583 --> 00:18:47.627 position:50% align:center
So, you made any progress yet?

00:18:47.711 --> 00:18:49.754 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU gasps]

00:18:49.838 --> 00:18:50.964 position:50% align:center
No, not really.

00:18:51.047 --> 00:18:52.674 position:50% align:center
What's the matter, nerd?

00:18:52.757 --> 00:18:55.760 position:50% align:center
I thought you were gonna
surpass me and be number one.

00:18:55.844 --> 00:18:57.804 position:50% align:center
Kirishima! Let me Howitzer you.

00:18:57.887 --> 00:18:58.638 position:50% align:center
[KIRISHIMA]
Bring it!

00:18:58.722 --> 00:18:59.723 position:50% align:center
[SATO]
Whoa, no way!

00:18:59.806 --> 00:19:01.016 position:50% align:center
You'll blow up
the entire building!

00:19:01.099 --> 00:19:04.019 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] Kacchan is right.
When I really focus,

00:19:04.102 --> 00:19:06.855 position:50% align:center
I can use up to 20
percent of my Quirk.

00:19:06.938 --> 00:19:11.026 position:50% align:center
But that still wasn't
enough to beat Chisaki.

00:19:11.109 --> 00:19:12.944 position:50% align:center
I need to be able
to use 100 percent

00:19:13.028 --> 00:19:14.904 position:50% align:center
of One For All without any help.

00:19:14.988 --> 00:19:17.949 position:50% align:center
Otherwise, I won't be able
to win or save anyone.

00:19:18.033 --> 00:19:19.284 position:50% align:center
[AOYAMA]
Hey.

00:19:22.954 --> 00:19:24.497 position:50% align:center
Watch this.

00:19:25.999 --> 00:19:29.544 position:50% align:center
My new move, the
Navel Buffet Laser!

00:19:29.627 --> 00:19:30.545 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Oh.

00:19:30.628 --> 00:19:32.380 position:50% align:center
Feast your eyes.

00:19:35.967 --> 00:19:38.428 position:50% align:center
[AOYAMA grunting]

00:19:38.511 --> 00:19:39.596 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:19:43.141 --> 00:19:45.810 position:50% align:center
[AOYAMA] When I do this,
my tummy always starts hurting.

00:19:45.894 --> 00:19:47.979 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] Then why did you
show me just now?

00:19:48.063 --> 00:19:50.690 position:50% align:center
Mr. Cementos. Aoyama
isn't feeling well.

00:19:50.774 --> 00:19:52.150 position:50% align:center
Can I take him to go rest?

00:19:52.233 --> 00:19:53.777 position:50% align:center
[CEMENTOS]
Go ahead.

00:19:57.489 --> 00:19:59.032 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Just the two of us.

00:19:59.115 --> 00:20:01.534 position:50% align:center
If I'm going to ask
what's up, now's the time!

00:20:01.618 --> 00:20:04.496 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Um. So, you were on my balcony.

00:20:04.579 --> 00:20:06.164 position:50% align:center
And then...

00:20:08.667 --> 00:20:10.835 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
The whole "I know" thing.

00:20:10.919 --> 00:20:12.420 position:50% align:center
What did you mean?

00:20:12.504 --> 00:20:15.340 position:50% align:center
[AOYAMA] That I know your Quirk
isn't compatible with your body.

00:20:15.423 --> 00:20:17.175 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:20:17.258 --> 00:20:19.761 position:50% align:center
[AOYAMA]
Which means, you're like me.

00:20:19.844 --> 00:20:23.181 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] Aoyama. What
are you talking about?

00:20:23.264 --> 00:20:27.519 position:50% align:center
You think so? But how?

00:20:27.602 --> 00:20:29.104 position:50% align:center
[AOYAMA] I've had to
wear this support belt,

00:20:29.187 --> 00:20:31.564 position:50% align:center
ever since I was
<i>un petit garcon</i> .

00:20:31.648 --> 00:20:33.483 position:50% align:center
The truth is...

00:20:33.566 --> 00:20:35.193 position:50% align:center
If I don't wear it,
then sometimes

00:20:35.276 --> 00:20:38.446 position:50% align:center
my Navel Laser just leaks out.

00:20:38.530 --> 00:20:41.366 position:50% align:center
I was born that way.

00:20:41.449 --> 00:20:42.534 position:50% align:center
You see,

00:20:42.617 --> 00:20:45.453 position:50% align:center
my body wasn't made
to handle my Quirk.

00:20:45.537 --> 00:20:48.206 position:50% align:center
That's what the doctors said.

00:20:48.289 --> 00:20:49.666 position:50% align:center
When you first started at UA,

00:20:49.749 --> 00:20:51.960 position:50% align:center
you couldn't control
your power at all.

00:20:52.043 --> 00:20:54.295 position:50% align:center
I remember.

00:20:54.379 --> 00:20:56.589 position:50% align:center
I've always thought
we were similar.

00:20:56.673 --> 00:20:58.633 position:50% align:center
And now, ever since
the work study,

00:20:58.717 --> 00:21:00.427 position:50% align:center
you seem to be
even more impatient

00:21:00.510 --> 00:21:02.303 position:50% align:center
to succeed than before.

00:21:02.387 --> 00:21:04.973 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I guess so.

00:21:05.056 --> 00:21:07.142 position:50% align:center
[AOYAMA]
Aren't surprises the best?

00:21:07.225 --> 00:21:10.020 position:50% align:center
Honestly, I think they make
me happier than anything!

00:21:10.103 --> 00:21:12.647 position:50% align:center
That's why I left the message,
to raise your spirits!

00:21:12.731 --> 00:21:15.150 position:50% align:center
Did it work? Was the
cheese delicious?

00:21:15.233 --> 00:21:18.528 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] I didn't exactly wanna
eat it off the ground!

00:21:18.611 --> 00:21:21.364 position:50% align:center
[AOYAMA] If we can't overcome
the things that bring us pain,

00:21:21.448 --> 00:21:24.951 position:50% align:center
then you won't be able
to twinkle, <i>mon ami</i> !

00:21:25.035 --> 00:21:26.995 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
I thought he was being creepy,

00:21:27.078 --> 00:21:30.623 position:50% align:center
but he just wanted
to encourage me.

00:21:30.707 --> 00:21:32.000 position:50% align:center
Know what, you're right.

00:21:32.083 --> 00:21:34.002 position:50% align:center
And your surprise
was a huge success.

00:21:34.085 --> 00:21:35.670 position:50% align:center
Thanks, Aoyama!

00:21:38.131 --> 00:21:40.383 position:50% align:center
Um, are you okay?

00:21:40.467 --> 00:21:42.302 position:50% align:center
[squeaking]

00:21:42.385 --> 00:21:44.095 position:50% align:center
[AOYAMA]
It came out.

00:21:47.098 --> 00:21:48.683 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
And so...

00:21:48.767 --> 00:21:49.934 position:50% align:center
[AOYAMA]
Try this pastry!

00:21:50.018 --> 00:21:51.227 position:50% align:center
Yeah, sure!

00:21:51.311 --> 00:21:54.898 position:50% align:center
Twinkles, you've been,
like, so cheerful lately.

00:21:54.981 --> 00:21:55.982 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
That's the story of how

00:21:56.066 --> 00:21:58.526 position:50% align:center
Aoyama and I became friends.

00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:30.702 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Here's the preview!

00:23:30.785 --> 00:23:33.872 position:50% align:center
Autumn! It's the season
of school festivals.

00:23:33.955 --> 00:23:35.957 position:50% align:center
Those of us in the
hero course's Class 1-A

00:23:36.041 --> 00:23:37.709 position:50% align:center
were attacked by the
League of Villains

00:23:37.792 --> 00:23:40.045 position:50% align:center
and caused trouble for
the other UA students.

00:23:40.128 --> 00:23:41.588 position:50% align:center
So, to make it up to them,

00:23:41.671 --> 00:23:43.840 position:50% align:center
we're planning to put on
a special performance.

00:23:43.923 --> 00:23:45.717 position:50% align:center
We want everyone to have fun,

00:23:45.800 --> 00:23:49.637 position:50% align:center
and I want to see one little
girl smile, especially.

00:23:49.721 --> 00:23:51.890 position:50% align:center
Next time: "School Festival."

00:23:51.973 --> 00:23:54.517 position:50% align:center
I just hope no villains
ruin our plans.

00:23:54.601 --> 00:23:57.145 position:50% align:center
Go beyond! Plus Ultra!
