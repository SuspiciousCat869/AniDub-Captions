[KIRISHIMA]
Uh-- Midoriya! Good morning.

00:00:12.554 --> 00:00:14.639 position:50% align:center
Are you headed off to
your work study, too?

00:00:14.723 --> 00:00:15.724 position:50% align:center
Cool, so'm I!

00:00:15.807 --> 00:00:17.225 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I finally got
called in again.

00:00:17.308 --> 00:00:18.727 position:50% align:center
Feels like it's been forever.

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.937 position:50% align:center
I wonder why they said not
to wear our costumes, though.

00:00:21.021 --> 00:00:23.356 position:50% align:center
[OCHACO]
Oh! Good morning, guys!

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:24.691 position:50% align:center
You going in today?

00:00:24.774 --> 00:00:26.693 position:50% align:center
--[IZUKU] Yeah.
--Huh, so are we.

00:00:26.776 --> 00:00:28.611 position:50% align:center
That's kinda weird.

00:00:28.695 --> 00:00:30.363 position:50% align:center
Hey. Us, too!

00:00:30.447 --> 00:00:31.865 position:50% align:center
Wanna walk to the
station together?

00:00:31.948 --> 00:00:34.284 position:50% align:center
[OCHACO] Ooh! Please!
I mean, if you don't mind.

00:00:34.367 --> 00:00:35.618 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
We appreciate it!

00:00:35.702 --> 00:00:38.121 position:50% align:center
[KIRISHIMA]
What's with all the heroes?

00:00:38.204 --> 00:00:39.998 position:50% align:center
Wait, we're going the same way?

00:00:40.081 --> 00:00:41.624 position:50% align:center
I thought you were
working in Kansai.

00:00:41.708 --> 00:00:43.043 position:50% align:center
Usually, yeah,

00:00:43.126 --> 00:00:44.753 position:50% align:center
but I guess we're meeting
someplace different today.

00:00:44.836 --> 00:00:47.339 position:50% align:center
What a coincidence. Us, too.

00:00:47.422 --> 00:00:49.549 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Everyone's on the same train.

00:00:49.632 --> 00:00:51.634 position:50% align:center
Going to the same station.

00:00:51.718 --> 00:00:53.345 position:50% align:center
This is kinda weird.

00:00:54.846 --> 00:00:56.765 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] We're going
in the same direction.

00:00:56.848 --> 00:00:59.476 position:50% align:center
Even turning at the same corner.

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:01.019 position:50% align:center
Heyo!

00:01:01.102 --> 00:01:03.646 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
The Big Three are all here?

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:07.233 position:50% align:center
What in the world?
What's going on?

00:01:11.363 --> 00:01:12.364 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:01:12.447 --> 00:01:15.575 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Gran Torino? And Mr. Aizawa?

00:01:15.658 --> 00:01:17.494 position:50% align:center
The Dragoon Hero: Ryukyu.

00:01:17.577 --> 00:01:21.915 position:50% align:center
The BMI Hero: Fatgum,
Locklock, Kesagiri Man,

00:01:21.998 --> 00:01:23.458 position:50% align:center
and Mr. Brave.

00:01:23.541 --> 00:01:26.044 position:50% align:center
All these incredible
people in the same room.

00:01:26.127 --> 00:01:29.255 position:50% align:center
From big-shot pros to
more minor, local heroes.

00:01:29.339 --> 00:01:31.216 position:50% align:center
This is amazing!

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:34.511 position:50% align:center
Whatever's happening,
it must be big.

00:03:05.435 --> 00:03:06.728 position:50% align:center
[HADO]
Hey, what's the scoop?

00:03:06.811 --> 00:03:09.397 position:50% align:center
What's going on?
Talk to me, Ryukyu!

00:03:09.481 --> 00:03:12.317 position:50% align:center
I mean, I know you said there's
a meeting, but what's it about?

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:13.610 position:50% align:center
Patience, Nejire.

00:03:13.693 --> 00:03:15.236 position:50% align:center
You, too, Mr. Aizawa?

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:17.238 position:50% align:center
I'm confused. Why are you here?

00:03:17.322 --> 00:03:19.407 position:50% align:center
I was called in last
minute for this thing.

00:03:19.491 --> 00:03:21.826 position:50% align:center
I think I've got a rough
idea of what it's about.

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:23.161 position:50% align:center
[RYUKYU]
You should, too.

00:03:23.244 --> 00:03:24.788 position:50% align:center
Remember what I told you, girls?

00:03:24.871 --> 00:03:26.414 position:50% align:center
Students or not, you've already

00:03:26.498 --> 00:03:29.209 position:50% align:center
proved yourselves
to be valuable assets.

00:03:29.292 --> 00:03:33.129 position:50% align:center
We may even have a role for you
in a new case that's come up.

00:03:33.213 --> 00:03:35.924 position:50% align:center
[OCHACO, TSUYU]
It's about the new case!

00:03:36.007 --> 00:03:37.342 position:50% align:center
[RYUKYU]
We're all here, Nighteye.

00:03:37.425 --> 00:03:39.094 position:50% align:center
Let's get started.

00:03:39.177 --> 00:03:41.346 position:50% align:center
Thanks to the information
provided by all of you,

00:03:41.429 --> 00:03:45.225 position:50% align:center
our investigation has
progressed substantially.

00:03:45.308 --> 00:03:47.435 position:50% align:center
We've invited you all here
for a joint conference

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:49.854 position:50% align:center
to share the intel
we've acquired.

00:03:49.938 --> 00:03:52.816 position:50% align:center
Regarding the yakuza
group Shie Hassaikai

00:03:52.899 --> 00:03:55.652 position:50% align:center
and what we believe
they might be planning.

00:03:55.735 --> 00:03:57.278 position:50% align:center
Hold on, I feel like
I'm missin' something

00:03:57.362 --> 00:04:00.156 position:50% align:center
really important here.
Shie H'what now?

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:02.784 position:50% align:center
Some bad guys're planning
to do some bad things.

00:04:02.867 --> 00:04:05.787 position:50% align:center
And they've called a meeting
so we can talk it all out.

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:09.040 position:50% align:center
Trust me. You two are
very much involved.

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:17.048 position:50% align:center
[BUBBLE GIRL] All right,
let's begin at the beginning.

00:04:17.132 --> 00:04:18.883 position:50% align:center
For the past couple
of weeks now,

00:04:18.967 --> 00:04:21.886 position:50% align:center
those of us at Nighteye Agency
have been conducting

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:24.264 position:50% align:center
an investigation
into Shie Hassaikai,

00:04:24.347 --> 00:04:26.766 position:50% align:center
a small but organized
group of criminals.

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:28.226 position:50% align:center
[KESAGIRI MAN]
What prompted this?

00:04:28.309 --> 00:04:30.145 position:50% align:center
[BUBBLE GIRL] An accident
involving a gang of thieves

00:04:30.228 --> 00:04:31.813 position:50% align:center
called the Reservoir Dogs.

00:04:31.896 --> 00:04:33.398 position:50% align:center
[MR. BRAVE]
Yeah, I heard about that.

00:04:33.481 --> 00:04:35.275 position:50% align:center
[BUBBLE GIRL] The police thought
the whole thing was an accident,

00:04:35.358 --> 00:04:37.777 position:50% align:center
but there were a number of
details that didn't add up,

00:04:37.861 --> 00:04:39.821 position:50% align:center
so we began tailing them.

00:04:39.904 --> 00:04:42.907 position:50% align:center
[CENTIPEDER] In my capacity
as a Nighteye Agency sidekick,

00:04:42.991 --> 00:04:46.286 position:50% align:center
I began following leads
to see what I could uncover.

00:04:46.369 --> 00:04:47.912 position:50% align:center
I found that, in the past year,

00:04:47.996 --> 00:04:50.749 position:50% align:center
the members of Shie Hassaikai
have had increased contact

00:04:50.832 --> 00:04:52.917 position:50% align:center
with those outside
of their organization,

00:04:53.001 --> 00:04:54.878 position:50% align:center
including other groups
whose business dealings

00:04:54.961 --> 00:04:56.629 position:50% align:center
are less than reputable.

00:04:56.713 --> 00:04:58.173 position:50% align:center
Their aim seemed to be expanding

00:04:58.256 --> 00:05:01.301 position:50% align:center
their organization and
enriching its coffers.

00:05:01.384 --> 00:05:04.054 position:50% align:center
Shortly after our
investigation began,

00:05:04.137 --> 00:05:06.890 position:50% align:center
they made contact with a member
of the League of Villains.

00:05:06.973 --> 00:05:10.101 position:50% align:center
Jin Bubaigawara,
villain name: Twice.

00:05:10.185 --> 00:05:12.145 position:50% align:center
They were wary of being tailed,

00:05:12.228 --> 00:05:15.940 position:50% align:center
so I was unable to follow them,
but with the help of the police,

00:05:16.024 --> 00:05:17.859 position:50% align:center
I confirmed that an
altercation had occurred

00:05:17.942 --> 00:05:19.152 position:50% align:center
between the two groups.

00:05:19.235 --> 00:05:20.612 position:50% align:center
That'd be about
when they decided

00:05:20.695 --> 00:05:22.447 position:50% align:center
to reach out to
Tsukauchi and me.

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:25.742 position:50% align:center
Figured we'd be able to assist,
given the League's involvement.

00:05:25.825 --> 00:05:27.410 position:50% align:center
[KESAGIRI MAN]
Where is Tsukauchi?

00:05:27.494 --> 00:05:29.579 position:50% align:center
Follow-ups with some
other eyewitnesses.

00:05:29.662 --> 00:05:31.748 position:50% align:center
Y'know, cop stuff.

00:05:31.831 --> 00:05:33.208 position:50% align:center
Sorry, kid.

00:05:33.291 --> 00:05:36.461 position:50% align:center
I didn't see something
like this coming.

00:05:36.544 --> 00:05:37.545 position:50% align:center
I've got a bad feeling

00:05:37.629 --> 00:05:39.422 position:50% align:center
that things are
about to get ugly.

00:05:39.506 --> 00:05:41.466 position:50% align:center
I don't care if they
do. I wanna help.

00:05:41.549 --> 00:05:42.842 position:50% align:center
Hold up, you know him?

00:05:42.926 --> 00:05:45.512 position:50% align:center
Oh, Grand Torino? I did
my internship with him.

00:05:45.595 --> 00:05:47.180 position:50% align:center
[KIRISHIMA] That's the old man
who was with All Might

00:05:47.263 --> 00:05:51.559 position:50% align:center
in Kamino! Midoriya
knows some big guns.

00:05:51.643 --> 00:05:53.978 position:50% align:center
Go on, Bubble Girl.

00:05:54.062 --> 00:05:56.356 position:50% align:center
So, after all that went down,

00:05:56.439 --> 00:05:58.900 position:50% align:center
we posted a notice on the
HN requesting assistance.

00:05:58.983 --> 00:06:00.276 position:50% align:center
[CENTIPEDER]
I think we can skip that part.

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:01.111 position:50% align:center
Sorry!

00:06:01.194 --> 00:06:02.487 position:50% align:center
What's the "HN"?

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:04.197 position:50% align:center
Stands for Hero Network.

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:07.283 position:50% align:center
It's an online service that can
only be accessed by pros.

00:06:07.367 --> 00:06:10.036 position:50% align:center
You can see what all the
heroes in the country are up to,

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:12.330 position:50% align:center
and you can ask for help
from people whose Quirks

00:06:12.414 --> 00:06:13.581 position:50% align:center
might come in handy.

00:06:13.665 --> 00:06:15.125 position:50% align:center
Does anybody wanna tell me why

00:06:15.208 --> 00:06:17.627 position:50% align:center
a buncha high school kids were
invited to this conference?

00:06:17.711 --> 00:06:19.462 position:50% align:center
I don't care if
they are from UA.

00:06:19.546 --> 00:06:21.339 position:50% align:center
If we have to keep stopping
to explain this stuff,

00:06:21.423 --> 00:06:22.590 position:50% align:center
we'll never get
to the actual plan.

00:06:22.674 --> 00:06:23.925 position:50% align:center
[FATGUM]
Don't say that.

00:06:24.009 --> 00:06:26.761 position:50% align:center
These two have important
information to pass along.

00:06:26.845 --> 00:06:28.471 position:50% align:center
Uh, we do?

00:06:28.555 --> 00:06:30.181 position:50% align:center
[AMAJIKI]
I wanna go home.

00:06:30.265 --> 00:06:32.142 position:50% align:center
Anyway, I see a lot
of new faces,

00:06:32.225 --> 00:06:34.060 position:50% align:center
so let me introduce myself.

00:06:34.144 --> 00:06:36.271 position:50% align:center
Nice to meetcha. I'm Fatgum.

00:06:36.354 --> 00:06:38.148 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
He's so cute and squishy.

00:06:38.231 --> 00:06:40.275 position:50% align:center
Hah! Who wants candy?

00:06:40.358 --> 00:06:42.360 position:50% align:center
Hassaikai's movements
are hard to trace,

00:06:42.444 --> 00:06:44.738 position:50% align:center
but we suspect one of their
main sources of income

00:06:44.821 --> 00:06:46.614 position:50% align:center
is illegal drug sales.

00:06:46.698 --> 00:06:48.408 position:50% align:center
So I requested
help from heroes

00:06:48.491 --> 00:06:50.577 position:50% align:center
who have some expertise
in that area.

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:52.120 position:50% align:center
[KIRISHIMA]
Oh, yeah, he said something

00:06:52.203 --> 00:06:53.913 position:50% align:center
about catching smugglers.

00:06:53.997 --> 00:06:56.374 position:50% align:center
Yup, I brought in my
fair share of drug dealers

00:06:56.458 --> 00:06:59.294 position:50% align:center
back in the day, and at
Red Riot's debut fight,

00:06:59.377 --> 00:07:01.129 position:50% align:center
he proved he could, too!

00:07:02.172 --> 00:07:04.257 position:50% align:center
[FATGUM] Tamaki was shot,
and the bullet contained

00:07:04.341 --> 00:07:07.093 position:50% align:center
some kinda drug I've
never heard of before.

00:07:07.177 --> 00:07:09.220 position:50% align:center
One that destroys Quirks.

00:07:09.304 --> 00:07:10.722 position:50% align:center
[KESAGIRI MAN]
Destroys Quirks?

00:07:10.805 --> 00:07:13.600 position:50% align:center
Whoa, what? Tamaki,
you're okay, right?

00:07:13.683 --> 00:07:16.186 position:50% align:center
Yeah, the stuff wore
off while I slept.

00:07:16.269 --> 00:07:17.312 position:50% align:center
Here, look.

00:07:17.395 --> 00:07:19.105 position:50% align:center
I've got this cow
hoof and everything.

00:07:19.189 --> 00:07:20.857 position:50% align:center
[MIRIO] Guess we know what
you had for breakfast!

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:23.068 position:50% align:center
I'm glad to know the effects
aren't permanent at least.

00:07:23.151 --> 00:07:24.903 position:50% align:center
So this stuff doesn't
zap a Quirk for good.

00:07:24.986 --> 00:07:26.196 position:50% align:center
[SIR NIGHTEYE]
No.

00:07:26.279 --> 00:07:28.782 position:50% align:center
But Eraser Head has
some further insight.

00:07:28.865 --> 00:07:30.450 position:50% align:center
It doesn't seem
to function exactly

00:07:30.533 --> 00:07:32.118 position:50% align:center
like my Erasure does.

00:07:32.202 --> 00:07:35.455 position:50% align:center
Since I'm not actually
attacking the Quirk directly.

00:07:35.538 --> 00:07:38.208 position:50% align:center
What we call a Quirk
is an extraordinary addition

00:07:38.291 --> 00:07:40.460 position:50% align:center
to an ordinary human body.

00:07:40.543 --> 00:07:44.547 position:50% align:center
Those additions are collectively
referred to as "Quirk genes."

00:07:44.631 --> 00:07:46.758 position:50% align:center
I can shield those
genes and temporarily

00:07:46.841 --> 00:07:50.470 position:50% align:center
block their expression, but I
don't actually damage them.

00:07:50.553 --> 00:07:52.305 position:50% align:center
But after Tamaki here was shot,

00:07:52.389 --> 00:07:54.099 position:50% align:center
we brought him to the
hospital, and they found

00:07:54.182 --> 00:07:56.601 position:50% align:center
that his Quirk genes
had sustained damage.

00:07:56.685 --> 00:07:58.520 position:50% align:center
Fortunately, they seem to
have healed on their own,

00:07:58.603 --> 00:07:59.896 position:50% align:center
and he's back to normal now.

00:07:59.979 --> 00:08:01.481 position:50% align:center
What do we know
about the substance

00:08:01.564 --> 00:08:02.982 position:50% align:center
he was shot with?

00:08:03.066 --> 00:08:05.402 position:50% align:center
[FATGUM] Whatever it was didn't
harm the rest of his body.

00:08:05.485 --> 00:08:08.029 position:50% align:center
Nothing but his Quirk
was impaired in any way.

00:08:08.113 --> 00:08:09.781 position:50% align:center
The guy who shot him clammed up.

00:08:09.864 --> 00:08:11.074 position:50% align:center
He won't say a word.

00:08:11.157 --> 00:08:14.994 position:50% align:center
And the round that hit
Tamaki was totally spent.

00:08:15.078 --> 00:08:18.164 position:50% align:center
However, Kirishima
bravely defended Tamaki

00:08:18.248 --> 00:08:20.959 position:50% align:center
from a bullet, which then
bounced off his own body

00:08:21.042 --> 00:08:23.461 position:50% align:center
and should now provide us
with a viable sample.

00:08:23.545 --> 00:08:26.923 position:50% align:center
Whoa, I did that?
Really? That's crazy!

00:08:27.007 --> 00:08:29.259 position:50% align:center
[KIRISHIMA]
I have no idea what's going on.

00:08:29.342 --> 00:08:31.136 position:50% align:center
Wow, awesome job, Kirishima!

00:08:31.219 --> 00:08:32.387 position:50% align:center
That's so cool!

00:08:32.470 --> 00:08:36.099 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah. His Quirk.
It's Hardening, right?

00:08:36.182 --> 00:08:38.435 position:50% align:center
And when we analyzed the
substance from the bullet,

00:08:38.518 --> 00:08:42.355 position:50% align:center
we discovered something that
made me sick to my stomach.

00:08:42.439 --> 00:08:44.774 position:50% align:center
It contained human
blood and cells.

00:08:44.858 --> 00:08:46.067 position:50% align:center
[heartbeats]

00:08:46.151 --> 00:08:48.903 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Human blood?

00:08:48.987 --> 00:08:50.280 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:08:50.363 --> 00:08:53.450 position:50% align:center
Sounds like something
out of a scary movie.

00:08:54.701 --> 00:08:57.662 position:50% align:center
In other words, that effect
came from a person.

00:08:57.746 --> 00:09:02.250 position:50% align:center
From someone's power.
A Quirk that can destroy Quirks.

00:09:03.626 --> 00:09:05.670 position:50% align:center
[MASKED HERO] I'm not
connecting the dots, here.

00:09:05.754 --> 00:09:08.381 position:50% align:center
How is all this
related to Hassaikai?

00:09:08.465 --> 00:09:10.925 position:50% align:center
[FATGUM] The man who shot
Tamaki used an illegal drug

00:09:11.009 --> 00:09:14.054 position:50% align:center
to boost his Quirk during
his fight with Kirishima.

00:09:14.137 --> 00:09:16.181 position:50% align:center
The distribution channels
for stuff like that

00:09:16.264 --> 00:09:19.934 position:50% align:center
are complex. Although things've
shrunk since the old days,

00:09:20.018 --> 00:09:22.687 position:50% align:center
drugs still pass through
various people and organizations

00:09:22.771 --> 00:09:25.899 position:50% align:center
before they finally
reach the end user.

00:09:25.982 --> 00:09:27.942 position:50% align:center
There's no concrete
evidence that Hassaikai

00:09:28.026 --> 00:09:30.904 position:50% align:center
handled the drug, but we know
for a fact that they interacted

00:09:30.987 --> 00:09:33.740 position:50% align:center
with one of the middlemen
responsible for moving it.

00:09:33.823 --> 00:09:35.325 position:50% align:center
[MASKED HERO]
That's all?

00:09:35.408 --> 00:09:37.202 position:50% align:center
[SIR NIGHTEYE] The other day,
Ryukyu's team broke up a fight

00:09:37.285 --> 00:09:39.454 position:50% align:center
between two villain groups.

00:09:39.537 --> 00:09:40.997 position:50% align:center
One of those groups
was controlled by

00:09:41.081 --> 00:09:44.209 position:50% align:center
the intermediary organization
that Fatgum just mentioned.

00:09:44.292 --> 00:09:45.919 position:50% align:center
[RYUKYU] One of the two
giants had been given

00:09:46.002 --> 00:09:48.755 position:50% align:center
an inferior drug that
didn't last long.

00:09:48.838 --> 00:09:50.507 position:50% align:center
[KESAGIRI MAN] There have
been a rash of gang-related

00:09:50.590 --> 00:09:53.426 position:50% align:center
crimes recently, and
most could be connected

00:09:53.510 --> 00:09:55.970 position:50% align:center
to the Hassaikai if
you tried hard enough.

00:09:56.054 --> 00:09:57.472 position:50% align:center
[MASKED HERO] Which is what
it seems like you're doing:

00:09:57.555 --> 00:09:59.265 position:50% align:center
trying to make them guilty.

00:09:59.349 --> 00:10:02.852 position:50% align:center
Don't you have anything that
implicates them more clearly?

00:10:02.936 --> 00:10:04.354 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:10:04.437 --> 00:10:07.357 position:50% align:center
[SIR NIGHTEYE] Their young head,
Chisaki: Quirk, Overhaul.

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:10.110 position:50% align:center
With this power, he can
disassemble things

00:10:10.193 --> 00:10:12.070 position:50% align:center
and then reassemble them.

00:10:12.153 --> 00:10:15.699 position:50% align:center
A Quirk that allows him to
completely break down matter.

00:10:15.782 --> 00:10:18.576 position:50% align:center
And a bullet that can
break down Quirks.

00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:20.036 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:10:27.460 --> 00:10:30.296 position:50% align:center
[ERI]
Please. Please don't go.

00:10:34.134 --> 00:10:36.553 position:50% align:center
[SIR NIGHTEYE] Chisaki
has a daughter named Eri.

00:10:36.636 --> 00:10:39.806 position:50% align:center
There are no records or
details about her birth.

00:10:39.889 --> 00:10:42.392 position:50% align:center
But when Miro and Midoriya
encountered her,

00:10:42.475 --> 00:10:43.768 position:50% align:center
they noticed there were bandages

00:10:43.852 --> 00:10:45.729 position:50% align:center
wrapped around
her arms and legs.

00:10:45.812 --> 00:10:48.356 position:50% align:center
Could he really do
something so horrific?

00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:50.191 position:50% align:center
Unfortunately, yes.

00:10:50.275 --> 00:10:53.570 position:50% align:center
In a world of superhumans, if
you can dream it, you can do it.

00:10:53.653 --> 00:10:56.072 position:50% align:center
Hold on, what are
they talking about?

00:10:56.156 --> 00:10:58.950 position:50% align:center
Once again, why do we have
children in this meeting?

00:10:59.034 --> 00:11:00.994 position:50% align:center
I'll say this one time:

00:11:01.077 --> 00:11:02.996 position:50% align:center
We're wondering if
this Chisaki bastard

00:11:03.079 --> 00:11:05.582 position:50% align:center
is turning his daughter's
body into bullets

00:11:05.665 --> 00:11:08.668 position:50% align:center
and selling them on
the black market.

00:11:08.752 --> 00:11:09.919 position:50% align:center
No.

00:11:10.003 --> 00:11:11.713 position:50% align:center
Oh, don't tell me...

00:11:11.796 --> 00:11:13.089 position:50% align:center
To be clear, we aren't certain

00:11:13.173 --> 00:11:15.592 position:50% align:center
that he's actually
selling the bullets.

00:11:15.675 --> 00:11:19.137 position:50% align:center
At this point, their efficacy
appears to be questionable.

00:11:19.220 --> 00:11:22.098 position:50% align:center
It's possible that they're
still in the testing phase,

00:11:22.182 --> 00:11:23.558 position:50% align:center
and he's giving them
out as samples

00:11:23.641 --> 00:11:26.353 position:50% align:center
to rally more people
to his cause.

00:11:26.436 --> 00:11:28.104 position:50% align:center
We have no hard evidence,

00:11:28.188 --> 00:11:30.106 position:50% align:center
but we do know he's
gathering allies

00:11:30.190 --> 00:11:32.609 position:50% align:center
and funds from
across the nation.

00:11:32.692 --> 00:11:35.070 position:50% align:center
If the completed drug
allows him to annihilate

00:11:35.153 --> 00:11:37.072 position:50% align:center
someone's Quirk entirely,

00:11:37.155 --> 00:11:40.033 position:50% align:center
imagine the devastation
he could cause.

00:11:40.116 --> 00:11:41.534 position:50% align:center
Just talking about it's enough

00:11:41.618 --> 00:11:45.080 position:50% align:center
to make my blood boil.
Let's go get this monster!

00:11:45.163 --> 00:11:47.040 position:50% align:center
Tch. Woulda saved us
a lot of trouble

00:11:47.123 --> 00:11:49.751 position:50% align:center
if these two amateurs had just
gotten the girl away from him.

00:11:49.834 --> 00:11:51.878 position:50% align:center
I take full responsibility.

00:11:51.961 --> 00:11:54.214 position:50% align:center
The blame should
not fall on them.

00:11:54.297 --> 00:11:55.840 position:50% align:center
Even without knowing
the whole story,

00:11:55.924 --> 00:11:59.636 position:50% align:center
they acted to save the child,
each in their own way.

00:11:59.719 --> 00:12:01.262 position:50% align:center
Midoriya was willing
to bear the risk

00:12:01.346 --> 00:12:04.516 position:50% align:center
of taking her then,
while Mirio chose to wait

00:12:04.599 --> 00:12:08.103 position:50% align:center
for another opportunity, when
success would be more likely.

00:12:08.186 --> 00:12:11.898 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] "World's greatest
hero." Not even close.

00:12:11.981 --> 00:12:16.152 position:50% align:center
[MIRIO] Save 1,000,000 people?
I couldn't even save her.

00:12:16.236 --> 00:12:17.904 position:50% align:center
I assure you,
nobody in this room

00:12:17.987 --> 00:12:19.698 position:50% align:center
is more frustrated
than they are.

00:12:19.781 --> 00:12:21.408 position:50% align:center
[clatter]

00:12:21.491 --> 00:12:23.660 position:50% align:center
We'll get Eri away
from him next time...

00:12:23.743 --> 00:12:25.245 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
...and we'll protect her!

00:12:25.328 --> 00:12:26.621 position:50% align:center
Indeed.

00:12:26.705 --> 00:12:29.207 position:50% align:center
That's precisely what we've
come here to discuss.

00:12:57.527 --> 00:12:59.779 position:50% align:center
We'll get Eri away
from him next time...

00:12:59.863 --> 00:13:01.698 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
...and we'll protect her.

00:13:01.781 --> 00:13:03.616 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
We'll save her!

00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:05.493 position:50% align:center
[MIRIO]
We won't let her down.

00:13:05.577 --> 00:13:09.205 position:50% align:center
[LOCKLOCK] Huh. You kids
wanna talk big, that's fine.

00:13:09.289 --> 00:13:11.124 position:50% align:center
But if what Nighteye
is saying is for real,

00:13:11.207 --> 00:13:12.500 position:50% align:center
that little girl
is at the center

00:13:12.584 --> 00:13:15.253 position:50% align:center
of Hassaikai's entire
underground drug operation.

00:13:15.337 --> 00:13:16.504 position:50% align:center
She may have managed
to get away

00:13:16.588 --> 00:13:18.340 position:50% align:center
from Overhaul for a few minutes,

00:13:18.423 --> 00:13:21.092 position:50% align:center
but she got herself seen
by a couple of heroes.

00:13:21.176 --> 00:13:22.510 position:50% align:center
You think he's still
gonna keep her

00:13:22.594 --> 00:13:25.555 position:50% align:center
at home after that? Hell,
I know I sure wouldn't.

00:13:25.638 --> 00:13:27.307 position:50% align:center
And if we go bustin'
into their headquarters

00:13:27.390 --> 00:13:28.475 position:50% align:center
and she's not there,

00:13:28.558 --> 00:13:30.143 position:50% align:center
they're gonna know
that we're onto them.

00:13:30.226 --> 00:13:32.604 position:50% align:center
We gotta be sure of
where he's hidin' her.

00:13:32.687 --> 00:13:34.147 position:50% align:center
[RYUKYU]
He's has a point.

00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:36.107 position:50% align:center
Do you have a plan
for that, Nighteye?

00:13:36.191 --> 00:13:38.151 position:50% align:center
That's our conundrum.

00:13:38.234 --> 00:13:39.944 position:50% align:center
Since we don't
currently know how far

00:13:40.028 --> 00:13:41.321 position:50% align:center
they've taken their plans,

00:13:41.404 --> 00:13:44.366 position:50% align:center
the success of our
initial strike is crucial.

00:13:44.449 --> 00:13:46.076 position:50% align:center
To that end, we've
made a thorough list

00:13:46.159 --> 00:13:48.578 position:50% align:center
of groups with connections
to Hassaikai,

00:13:48.661 --> 00:13:51.206 position:50% align:center
as well as properties
owned by the organization.

00:13:51.289 --> 00:13:53.166 position:50% align:center
This is our starting point.

00:13:53.249 --> 00:13:54.626 position:50% align:center
I would like you
all to investigate

00:13:54.709 --> 00:13:56.252 position:50% align:center
each coordinate on this map.

00:13:56.336 --> 00:13:59.506 position:50% align:center
It is the most logical way
to narrow down our targets.

00:13:59.589 --> 00:14:01.383 position:50% align:center
So that's why you
asked minor heroes

00:14:01.466 --> 00:14:02.926 position:50% align:center
like us to join you.

00:14:03.009 --> 00:14:04.010 position:50% align:center
[MASKED HERO]
What do you mean?

00:14:04.094 --> 00:14:05.553 position:50% align:center
Go on. Look.

00:14:05.637 --> 00:14:09.182 position:50% align:center
The heroes in this room all
operate in one of those locales.

00:14:09.265 --> 00:14:12.435 position:50% align:center
We know the areas
better than most.

00:14:12.519 --> 00:14:14.312 position:50% align:center
[FATGUM] Didn't expect someone
who worked with All Might

00:14:14.396 --> 00:14:17.023 position:50% align:center
for so long to be such
a careful planner.

00:14:17.107 --> 00:14:18.566 position:50% align:center
Let's just go bring 'em down!

00:14:18.650 --> 00:14:20.026 position:50% align:center
While we're takin'
our sweet time,

00:14:20.110 --> 00:14:22.404 position:50% align:center
that abused girl's out
there crying somewhere.

00:14:22.487 --> 00:14:24.781 position:50% align:center
We can't do this
like All Might would.

00:14:24.864 --> 00:14:27.367 position:50% align:center
That's why we must be meticulous
about our strategies

00:14:27.450 --> 00:14:28.952 position:50% align:center
and predictions from the outset.

00:14:29.035 --> 00:14:30.870 position:50% align:center
So we have the highest
chance of saving her.

00:14:30.954 --> 00:14:32.831 position:50% align:center
[GRAN TORINO]
He's right. We shouldn't rush.

00:14:32.914 --> 00:14:35.500 position:50% align:center
If we show our hand and then
don't end up rescuing her,

00:14:35.583 --> 00:14:38.003 position:50% align:center
then we'd just be
throwing gas on a fire.

00:14:38.086 --> 00:14:39.963 position:50% align:center
Like how Stain's
capture was a beacon

00:14:40.046 --> 00:14:42.674 position:50% align:center
that led criminals to seek
out and join the League.

00:14:42.757 --> 00:14:44.509 position:50% align:center
In fact, I wouldn't be surprised

00:14:44.592 --> 00:14:46.511 position:50% align:center
if they handed out
Quirk-destroying weapons

00:14:46.594 --> 00:14:48.930 position:50% align:center
to those hoodlums in order
to increase their recruitment.

00:14:49.014 --> 00:14:50.598 position:50% align:center
You're thinkin' too dang much.

00:14:50.682 --> 00:14:52.350 position:50% align:center
If we keep sitting here
yappin' about it,

00:14:52.434 --> 00:14:54.019 position:50% align:center
we're never gonna
get anything done!

00:14:54.102 --> 00:14:58.231 position:50% align:center
[AIZAWA]
Excuse me. I've got a question.

00:14:58.314 --> 00:15:00.525 position:50% align:center
I don't know the specifics
of your Quirk, Nighteye.

00:15:00.608 --> 00:15:02.152 position:50% align:center
Feel free to correct.

00:15:02.235 --> 00:15:03.862 position:50% align:center
But from what I've heard of it,

00:15:03.945 --> 00:15:06.614 position:50% align:center
your Quirk, Foresight allows
you to see into the future.

00:15:06.698 --> 00:15:10.076 position:50% align:center
So why not use it on us.
That's logical, right?

00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:14.289 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry. But I cannot.

00:15:14.372 --> 00:15:16.750 position:50% align:center
My Foresight has
some limitations.

00:15:16.833 --> 00:15:19.669 position:50% align:center
I need a full 24 hours
between activations.

00:15:19.753 --> 00:15:21.713 position:50% align:center
That means I get one person,

00:15:21.796 --> 00:15:24.799 position:50% align:center
and then I'm spent
for the rest of the day.

00:15:24.883 --> 00:15:27.552 position:50% align:center
Additionally, the future
is played in my mind

00:15:27.635 --> 00:15:29.220 position:50% align:center
like a flashback.

00:15:30.430 --> 00:15:32.724 position:50% align:center
[SIR NIGHTEYE] Think of it
like viewing a filmstrip.

00:15:32.807 --> 00:15:34.559 position:50% align:center
For one hour, I have the power

00:15:34.642 --> 00:15:37.687 position:50% align:center
to watch a person's
life as a movie.

00:15:37.771 --> 00:15:39.939 position:50% align:center
The issue is, everything I see

00:15:40.023 --> 00:15:42.984 position:50% align:center
is from a tight perspective
on the person in question.

00:15:43.068 --> 00:15:46.654 position:50% align:center
This severely limits my
capacity to interpret context.

00:15:46.738 --> 00:15:48.531 position:50% align:center
That should still provide
more than enough

00:15:48.615 --> 00:15:51.159 position:50% align:center
information to be useful,
don't you think?

00:15:51.242 --> 00:15:54.954 position:50% align:center
And it doesn't explain
why you can't do it.

00:15:55.038 --> 00:15:56.539 position:50% align:center
[SIR NIGHTEYE]
What if I saw imminent death

00:15:56.623 --> 00:16:00.460 position:50% align:center
in your near future. Worse...

00:16:00.543 --> 00:16:04.130 position:50% align:center
What if it were a cruel,
merciless demise?

00:16:04.214 --> 00:16:05.507 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:16:05.590 --> 00:16:07.217 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
This is...

00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:08.718 position:50% align:center
...because of what
happened with All Might.

00:16:08.802 --> 00:16:09.844 position:50% align:center
[SIR NIGHTEYE]
Please! Stop!

00:16:09.928 --> 00:16:12.222 position:50% align:center
If you continue
like this, I swear,

00:16:12.305 --> 00:16:14.140 position:50% align:center
you'll face off against
a villain and die

00:16:14.224 --> 00:16:16.810 position:50% align:center
an unspeakably gruesome death.

00:16:16.893 --> 00:16:18.895 position:50% align:center
[SIR NIGHTEYE] My Quirk
should be employed only after

00:16:18.978 --> 00:16:21.606 position:50% align:center
we've confirmed the highest
likelihood of success.

00:16:21.690 --> 00:16:23.817 position:50% align:center
Then it can help
ensure our victory.

00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:25.068 position:50% align:center
It shouldn't be relied upon

00:16:25.151 --> 00:16:27.278 position:50% align:center
when there are still
too many uncertainties.

00:16:27.362 --> 00:16:29.739 position:50% align:center
Whoa, whoa, whoa hold up.
Death is still information.

00:16:29.823 --> 00:16:32.450 position:50% align:center
If we know what's comin', we
can figure out how to survive.

00:16:32.534 --> 00:16:33.618 position:50% align:center
[SIR NIGHTEYE]
You don't understand.

00:16:33.702 --> 00:16:35.912 position:50% align:center
It's possible what
I see is unavoidable.

00:16:35.995 --> 00:16:38.164 position:50% align:center
Bro, that's the only
excuse you have, for real?

00:16:38.248 --> 00:16:40.166 position:50% align:center
Oh, hell no, just
use it on me now!

00:16:40.250 --> 00:16:42.377 position:50% align:center
I'll show you I can beat death.

00:16:42.460 --> 00:16:43.962 position:50% align:center
I can't.

00:16:48.925 --> 00:16:50.552 position:50% align:center
Yeah, all right.

00:17:02.439 --> 00:17:05.358 position:50% align:center
[sighs] We should get started.

00:17:05.442 --> 00:17:09.487 position:50% align:center
There's a child in trouble.
That's what's important here.

00:17:09.571 --> 00:17:11.239 position:50% align:center
[SIR NIGHTEYE] We must
confirm the girl's location

00:17:11.322 --> 00:17:13.742 position:50% align:center
and take her into our protection
as quickly as possible

00:17:13.825 --> 00:17:16.494 position:50% align:center
using the most accurate data.

00:17:16.578 --> 00:17:19.456 position:50% align:center
I'm counting on your
help. All of you.

00:17:27.672 --> 00:17:29.424 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
If only I'd rescued her then,

00:17:29.507 --> 00:17:33.053 position:50% align:center
even if I had to use force.
At least she'd be safe.

00:17:33.136 --> 00:17:36.806 position:50% align:center
Aw, man. So that's
what happened that day?

00:17:36.890 --> 00:17:38.600 position:50% align:center
So frustrating!

00:17:38.683 --> 00:17:40.769 position:50% align:center
We know you tried, Deku.

00:17:40.852 --> 00:17:44.773 position:50% align:center
[AMAJIKI] I've never seen
Mirio look so down before.

00:17:44.856 --> 00:17:46.775 position:50% align:center
[LOCKLOCK] We're wondering
if this Chisaki bastard

00:17:46.858 --> 00:17:49.277 position:50% align:center
is turning his daughter's
body into bullets

00:17:49.361 --> 00:17:51.571 position:50% align:center
and selling them
on the black market.

00:17:51.654 --> 00:17:53.406 position:50% align:center
[MIRIO]
Poor Eri.

00:17:57.077 --> 00:17:58.787 position:50% align:center
Is this a funeral or something?

00:17:58.870 --> 00:18:00.497 position:50% align:center
[TSUYU]
Mr. Aizawa, hello, sir.

00:18:00.580 --> 00:18:04.167 position:50% align:center
Ah. Call me Eraser Head
outside of school.

00:18:04.250 --> 00:18:06.044 position:50% align:center
You know, it's just my luck.

00:18:06.127 --> 00:18:07.629 position:50% align:center
Before you got involved in this,

00:18:07.712 --> 00:18:10.799 position:50% align:center
I was going to recommend that
your work studies be suspended.

00:18:10.882 --> 00:18:13.677 position:50% align:center
What? Why would you do that?

00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:15.053 position:50% align:center
[AIZAWA]
You were listening when he said

00:18:15.136 --> 00:18:18.223 position:50% align:center
the League of Villains
is involved, right?

00:18:18.306 --> 00:18:19.891 position:50% align:center
That changes things.

00:18:23.603 --> 00:18:25.647 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] We'll get Eri
away from him next time,

00:18:25.730 --> 00:18:27.941 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
...and we'll protect her.

00:18:28.024 --> 00:18:31.403 position:50% align:center
Here's the deal. Midoriya...

00:18:31.486 --> 00:18:34.781 position:50% align:center
You still haven't proven
I can trust you again.

00:18:34.864 --> 00:18:36.074 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:18:36.157 --> 00:18:38.118 position:50% align:center
[AIZAWA] In order to
regain our confidence,

00:18:38.201 --> 00:18:40.036 position:50% align:center
you'll need to obey every rule.

00:18:40.120 --> 00:18:43.081 position:50% align:center
I mean to the letter.
Be model students.

00:18:44.082 --> 00:18:46.793 position:50% align:center
[AIZAWA] Unfortunately,
I'm positive that if I try

00:18:46.876 --> 00:18:49.045 position:50% align:center
to stop you now, you'll
do something reckless

00:18:49.129 --> 00:18:53.675 position:50% align:center
and attempt to take things
into your own hands.

00:18:53.758 --> 00:18:55.427 position:50% align:center
So, I'll watch you.

00:18:55.510 --> 00:18:56.845 position:50% align:center
If you're going to
see this through,

00:18:56.928 --> 00:18:58.430 position:50% align:center
you gotta do it the right way.

00:18:58.513 --> 00:19:00.640 position:50% align:center
Use your head.

00:19:00.724 --> 00:19:03.184 position:50% align:center
Ya hear me? Problem child?

00:19:07.022 --> 00:19:09.274 position:50% align:center
Mirio, please, will
you try to smile?

00:19:09.357 --> 00:19:11.026 position:50% align:center
Hey! Hey! I know
what'll help you!

00:19:11.109 --> 00:19:13.445 position:50% align:center
Just remember! Regretting
something and getting frowny

00:19:13.528 --> 00:19:15.989 position:50% align:center
doesn't change things.
You know it?

00:19:17.532 --> 00:19:19.617 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:19:19.701 --> 00:19:21.494 position:50% align:center
I'll only say this once,

00:19:21.578 --> 00:19:24.330 position:50% align:center
in case it gives you
a little peace of mind.

00:19:24.414 --> 00:19:27.167 position:50% align:center
Just because you didn't
hold onto her this time,

00:19:27.250 --> 00:19:30.253 position:50% align:center
doesn't mean you
didn't give Eri hope.

00:19:30.337 --> 00:19:32.672 position:50% align:center
So keep looking forward.

00:19:32.756 --> 00:19:33.590 position:50% align:center
Right!

00:19:33.673 --> 00:19:34.883 position:50% align:center
Mr. Aizawa!

00:19:34.966 --> 00:19:36.551 position:50% align:center
[AIZAWA]
I said I'm Eraser here.

00:19:36.634 --> 00:19:38.970 position:50% align:center
I'm your man for the rest
of my life, Eraser!

00:19:39.054 --> 00:19:40.930 position:50% align:center
[AIZAWA]
Ugh, not interested.

00:19:41.014 --> 00:19:42.015 position:50% align:center
[KIRISHIMA]
Sorry!

00:19:42.098 --> 00:19:44.642 position:50% align:center
[OCHACO]
Take it down a notch, Kirishima.

00:19:44.726 --> 00:19:45.852 position:50% align:center
Mirio?

00:19:45.935 --> 00:19:48.480 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I know.

00:19:48.563 --> 00:19:51.358 position:50% align:center
Hey, Midoriya. Next time
we'll definitely save her.

00:19:51.441 --> 00:19:54.361 position:50% align:center
Right! No matter what!

00:19:55.945 --> 00:19:58.907 position:50% align:center
[SIR NIGHTEYE]
Now I understand. Of course.

00:19:58.990 --> 00:20:00.992 position:50% align:center
You sent Midoriya to me in
the hopes that he would help

00:20:01.076 --> 00:20:03.620 position:50% align:center
mend my relationship
with All Might.

00:20:03.703 --> 00:20:05.080 position:50% align:center
[GRAN TORINO]
Heh. I thought it would give you

00:20:05.163 --> 00:20:08.166 position:50% align:center
an excuse to talk, at least.

00:20:08.249 --> 00:20:09.709 position:50% align:center
When you get old, it's your job

00:20:09.793 --> 00:20:13.588 position:50% align:center
to help stubborn
youngsters. So, the kid.

00:20:13.672 --> 00:20:16.675 position:50% align:center
What are your honest
thoughts about him?

00:20:16.758 --> 00:20:20.470 position:50% align:center
I think he and All Might
are very similar.

00:20:20.553 --> 00:20:24.307 position:50% align:center
Especially when it comes to the
madness living deep within.

00:20:24.391 --> 00:20:26.893 position:50% align:center
The one I could
never understand.

00:20:26.976 --> 00:20:29.020 position:50% align:center
I see that in them both.

00:22:07.786 --> 00:22:10.580 position:50% align:center
Yo, Eri. Relax, it's just me.

00:22:10.663 --> 00:22:13.917 position:50% align:center
I'm just checkin' to make sure
you're doin' okay in here.

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:16.336 position:50% align:center
What? You haven't touched
any of your toys.

00:22:16.419 --> 00:22:18.755 position:50% align:center
And after I bought
'em special for you.

00:22:18.838 --> 00:22:20.256 position:50% align:center
Wouldn't hurt to
let your guard down

00:22:20.340 --> 00:22:22.258 position:50% align:center
a little, you know.

00:22:22.342 --> 00:22:23.885 position:50% align:center
[CARETAKER 69A]
Look happy or I might be the one

00:22:23.968 --> 00:22:26.554 position:50% align:center
who gets killed
next time, ya brat.

00:22:26.638 --> 00:22:29.641 position:50% align:center
See, I'm not scary.

00:22:29.724 --> 00:22:32.394 position:50% align:center
There anything you
want me to bring you?

00:22:32.477 --> 00:22:33.561 position:50% align:center
No worries.

00:22:33.645 --> 00:22:36.189 position:50% align:center
If I'm in the way,
I'll leave you alone.

00:22:38.525 --> 00:22:41.027 position:50% align:center
[CHISAKI] You're going
to be her new caretaker.

00:22:41.111 --> 00:22:43.405 position:50% align:center
Make sure she doesn't
want to run away.

00:22:43.488 --> 00:22:46.157 position:50% align:center
Use the carrot, not the stick.

00:22:46.241 --> 00:22:49.786 position:50% align:center
Be someone she trusts
and feels comfortable with.

00:22:49.869 --> 00:22:51.371 position:50% align:center
[CARETAKER 69A]
I'm a dead man.

00:22:51.454 --> 00:22:53.790 position:50% align:center
Like I have any idea
what kids like.

00:22:53.873 --> 00:22:56.793 position:50% align:center
Maybe I'll grab her one
of those magical girl dolls.

00:23:00.255 --> 00:23:02.048 position:50% align:center
[ERI]
So strange.

00:23:03.425 --> 00:23:06.845 position:50% align:center
[ERI]
So completely different.

00:23:06.928 --> 00:23:08.513 position:50% align:center
My entire life,

00:23:08.596 --> 00:23:11.433 position:50% align:center
no one's ever reached out
to me like that before.

00:23:11.516 --> 00:23:13.435 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] Whoa, I'm sorry.
You took a tumble.

00:23:13.518 --> 00:23:15.645 position:50% align:center
Are you okay? Can I help you up?

00:23:15.729 --> 00:23:18.690 position:50% align:center
Her whole body's shaking,
but she's not making a sound.

00:23:18.773 --> 00:23:20.442 position:50% align:center
What are you doing to this girl?

00:23:20.525 --> 00:23:24.070 position:50% align:center
[ERI]
He felt so kind.

00:23:24.154 --> 00:23:25.613 position:50% align:center
So warm.

00:23:29.409 --> 00:23:30.785 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Here's the preview.

00:23:30.869 --> 00:23:34.205 position:50% align:center
Those of us in work studies
are instructed to stand by

00:23:34.289 --> 00:23:35.665 position:50% align:center
while Sir Nighteye
and the other pros

00:23:35.749 --> 00:23:38.626 position:50% align:center
try to figure out where
Eri is being kept.

00:23:38.710 --> 00:23:41.254 position:50% align:center
My head is a mess as I'm
forced to wait for news.

00:23:41.338 --> 00:23:43.757 position:50% align:center
I can't stop thinking about
All Might's future,

00:23:43.840 --> 00:23:46.885 position:50% align:center
