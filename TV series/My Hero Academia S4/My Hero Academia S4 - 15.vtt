00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:17.392 position:50% align:center
[SHIGARAKI] Tell me again who
the next leader is gonna be.

00:00:17.475 --> 00:00:19.769 position:50% align:center
I hate you.

00:00:19.853 --> 00:00:22.188 position:50% align:center
You're too full of yourself.

00:00:24.774 --> 00:00:26.401 position:50% align:center
For the arm.

00:00:27.736 --> 00:00:29.320 position:50% align:center
[SHIGARAKI]
Two little boxes.

00:00:29.404 --> 00:00:32.323 position:50% align:center
Which one holds
the finished product?

00:00:32.407 --> 00:00:35.326 position:50% align:center
I'll just take both.

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:36.703 position:50% align:center
That's mine.

00:00:36.786 --> 00:00:40.331 position:50% align:center
[sighs] You know what
I think, Overhaul?

00:00:40.415 --> 00:00:43.543 position:50% align:center
Someone so obsessed
with erasing Quirks

00:00:43.626 --> 00:00:46.087 position:50% align:center
shouldn't have one of their own.

00:00:46.171 --> 00:00:48.006 position:50% align:center
Don't you agree?

00:00:51.634 --> 00:00:54.721 position:50% align:center
And all the fruits of
your labors belong to me!

00:00:54.804 --> 00:00:57.849 position:50% align:center
Now you don't even have
a thumb to suck on.

00:00:57.932 --> 00:01:00.226 position:50% align:center
You're doomed to watch
from the sidelines

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:02.687 position:50% align:center
as your dream falls apart.

00:01:02.771 --> 00:01:04.647 position:50% align:center
Let's do our best!

00:01:13.782 --> 00:01:16.659 position:50% align:center
[SHIGARAKI]
Next, it's our turn.

00:01:16.743 --> 00:01:25.001 position:50% align:center
[gasping, screaming]

00:02:58.845 --> 00:03:01.556 position:50% align:center
[GRAN TORINO] So, you've
had eyewitness reports eh?

00:03:01.639 --> 00:03:04.267 position:50% align:center
Hard to believe he's this
deep in the mountains.

00:03:04.351 --> 00:03:06.394 position:50% align:center
There's not all
that much out here.

00:03:06.478 --> 00:03:08.897 position:50% align:center
You're absolutely
sure it's Kurogiri?

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:10.190 position:50% align:center
In the last couple of days,

00:03:10.273 --> 00:03:12.025 position:50% align:center
four people have
reported spotting him.

00:03:12.108 --> 00:03:13.943 position:50% align:center
Given how remote the area is,

00:03:14.027 --> 00:03:15.445 position:50% align:center
I'd say the odds are good.

00:03:15.528 --> 00:03:17.280 position:50% align:center
I guess that's true.

00:03:17.364 --> 00:03:20.408 position:50% align:center
Unfortunately, his
Quirk is Warp Gate.

00:03:20.492 --> 00:03:23.745 position:50% align:center
That's gonna make him
hard to corner and catch.

00:03:23.828 --> 00:03:27.415 position:50% align:center
Still, four separate
reports does sound careless.

00:03:27.499 --> 00:03:28.917 position:50% align:center
I don't get it.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.294 position:50% align:center
What's the League
of Villains up to?

00:03:31.378 --> 00:03:32.671 position:50% align:center
Even if we don't
fully understand

00:03:32.754 --> 00:03:33.880 position:50% align:center
what their motives are,

00:03:33.963 --> 00:03:36.132 position:50% align:center
this is our best chance
to arrest Kurogiri.

00:03:36.216 --> 00:03:39.552 position:50% align:center
We need this to go smoothly,
so I'm counting on you,

00:03:39.636 --> 00:03:40.929 position:50% align:center
Gran Torino.

00:03:41.012 --> 00:03:42.764 position:50% align:center
You kids. Good grief.

00:03:42.847 --> 00:03:46.267 position:50% align:center
Can't believe you're working
an old man so hard.

00:03:52.357 --> 00:03:53.566 position:50% align:center
[DETECTIVE 70A]
Assistance needed.

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:55.443 position:50% align:center
The suspect has been found.

00:03:55.527 --> 00:03:58.196 position:50% align:center
He must be secured before
he activates his Quirk.

00:03:58.279 --> 00:03:59.489 position:50% align:center
[TSUKAUCHI]
'Kay, that means you're up.

00:03:59.572 --> 00:04:01.074 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I'm on it.

00:04:09.916 --> 00:04:11.876 position:50% align:center
You're not going anywhere.

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:17.757 position:50% align:center
So, I finally get
to meet you, Kurogiri.

00:04:17.841 --> 00:04:19.300 position:50% align:center
It's a pleasure.

00:04:19.384 --> 00:04:21.136 position:50% align:center
[KUROGIRI]
Gran Torino.

00:04:21.219 --> 00:04:22.679 position:50% align:center
Your Quirk makes you a pain

00:04:22.762 --> 00:04:24.931 position:50% align:center
for those of us trying
to stop the League.

00:04:25.015 --> 00:04:27.100 position:50% align:center
It'll be easier with you gone.

00:04:27.183 --> 00:04:28.977 position:50% align:center
[TSUKAUCHI]
Be careful!

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:30.020 position:50% align:center
Don't let him touch you.

00:04:30.103 --> 00:04:31.646 position:50% align:center
He's able to activate
his warp power

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:33.565 position:50% align:center
using his head and
both of his hands.

00:04:33.648 --> 00:04:35.025 position:50% align:center
He'll be hard to restrain.

00:04:35.108 --> 00:04:36.276 position:50% align:center
I'm well aware.

00:04:36.359 --> 00:04:37.777 position:50% align:center
I'll take him and
speed outta here

00:04:37.861 --> 00:04:39.821 position:50% align:center
before he gets a chance to bolt.

00:04:39.904 --> 00:04:41.614 position:50% align:center
You and me can even
get to know each other

00:04:41.698 --> 00:04:44.075 position:50% align:center
a little bit better
along the way.

00:04:44.159 --> 00:04:46.661 position:50% align:center
[KUROGIRI]
I wonder.

00:04:46.745 --> 00:04:49.122 position:50% align:center
Have you or the officers
heard whispers

00:04:49.205 --> 00:04:52.959 position:50% align:center
of a man with a wild appearance
traversing this area?

00:04:53.043 --> 00:04:54.294 position:50% align:center
What's that?

00:04:54.377 --> 00:04:56.671 position:50% align:center
[KUROGIRI] It seems he's
gotten too much attention.

00:04:56.755 --> 00:04:59.090 position:50% align:center
Though, I suppose
that can't be helped.

00:04:59.174 --> 00:05:03.345 position:50% align:center
I have business with the
individual in question.

00:05:03.428 --> 00:05:06.181 position:50% align:center
You can tell us all about
him during interrogations.

00:05:06.264 --> 00:05:07.891 position:50% align:center
[rumbling]

00:05:07.974 --> 00:05:10.935 position:50% align:center
What the heck?
Was that an earthquake?

00:05:11.019 --> 00:05:15.732 position:50% align:center
[KUROGIRI] His master
is very forward thinking.

00:05:15.815 --> 00:05:19.235 position:50% align:center
What are you talking about?

00:05:19.319 --> 00:05:21.196 position:50% align:center
[ALL FOR ONE]
Listen carefully.

00:05:21.279 --> 00:05:23.531 position:50% align:center
If, for whatever reason,
I should go away

00:05:23.615 --> 00:05:25.533 position:50% align:center
for an extended period,

00:05:25.617 --> 00:05:29.204 position:50% align:center
you will be the only one
who can protect Tomura.

00:05:29.287 --> 00:05:31.498 position:50% align:center
That said, should you
ever be concerned

00:05:31.581 --> 00:05:33.792 position:50% align:center
or feel as though
you need assistance,

00:05:33.875 --> 00:05:36.670 position:50% align:center
there is someone else
you can rely on.

00:05:36.753 --> 00:05:39.673 position:50% align:center
[KUROGIRI] Detective
Tsukauchi. Gran Torino.

00:05:39.756 --> 00:05:43.134 position:50% align:center
You must realize Shigaraki
is not the only person

00:05:43.218 --> 00:05:44.678 position:50% align:center
All For One cultivated.

00:05:44.761 --> 00:05:46.805 position:50% align:center
[RADIO VOICE 78A]
Hoping for a sunny day? Sorry.

00:05:46.888 --> 00:05:48.390 position:50% align:center
Unfortunately much
of the Kanto region...

00:05:48.473 --> 00:05:50.642 position:50% align:center
[KUROGIRI] Allow me to
introduce you to one of his

00:05:50.725 --> 00:05:56.189 position:50% align:center
most faithful Servants:
Gigantomachia.

00:05:56.272 --> 00:06:02.278 position:50% align:center
[GIGANTOMACHIA] Everything is
for the glory of my master.

00:06:10.078 --> 00:06:12.372 position:50% align:center
[NEWSCASTER 78A] Kai Chisaki,
the young head of a formerly

00:06:12.455 --> 00:06:15.333 position:50% align:center
prominent yakuza group,
was arrested for the abduction

00:06:15.417 --> 00:06:17.168 position:50% align:center
and confinement of a young girl.

00:06:17.252 --> 00:06:19.379 position:50% align:center
As police transported
him, however,

00:06:19.462 --> 00:06:21.881 position:50% align:center
they were attacked by
the League of Villains.

00:06:21.965 --> 00:06:24.300 position:50% align:center
During the incident,
the Sand Hero, Snatch,

00:06:24.384 --> 00:06:26.678 position:50% align:center
who was serving as
an escort, was killed.

00:06:26.761 --> 00:06:28.805 position:50% align:center
There were also members
of law enforcement

00:06:28.888 --> 00:06:30.306 position:50% align:center
who were injured.

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:32.183 position:50% align:center
This attack on a
villain in custody

00:06:32.267 --> 00:06:34.310 position:50% align:center
is an unprecedented failure.

00:06:34.394 --> 00:06:35.145 position:50% align:center
Officials have also confirmed...

00:06:35.228 --> 00:06:36.396 position:50% align:center
This is the only thing

00:06:36.479 --> 00:06:39.899 position:50% align:center
they've reported on
since yesterday.

00:06:39.983 --> 00:06:42.736 position:50% align:center
[AIZAWA] It isn't something you
should feel responsible for.

00:06:42.819 --> 00:06:44.946 position:50% align:center
Please try not
to blame yourself.

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:46.322 position:50% align:center
Yeah, okay.

00:06:46.406 --> 00:06:47.407 position:50% align:center
Good news is,

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:49.701 position:50% align:center
most everyone's headed
back to class.

00:06:49.784 --> 00:06:53.079 position:50% align:center
The doctors wanna monitor
Togata a little while longer.

00:06:53.163 --> 00:06:55.040 position:50% align:center
But Recovery Girl was
able to completely heal

00:06:55.123 --> 00:06:57.876 position:50% align:center
the rest of the students
involved in the raid.

00:06:57.959 --> 00:07:00.170 position:50% align:center
They're gathering
their things now.

00:07:00.253 --> 00:07:02.172 position:50% align:center
I'll stick around
a little while longer

00:07:02.255 --> 00:07:04.674 position:50% align:center
and heal a few more
patients since I'm here.

00:07:04.758 --> 00:07:06.009 position:50% align:center
I'll stay, too.

00:07:06.092 --> 00:07:09.220 position:50% align:center
I want to be here for Eri
whenever she wakes up.

00:07:09.304 --> 00:07:12.098 position:50% align:center
I'm afraid she's still
too dangerous for that.

00:07:12.182 --> 00:07:17.187 position:50% align:center
Right now, we need to trust
that the doctors will help her.

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:20.023 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I get that, but I
was hoping I could...

00:07:20.106 --> 00:07:22.025 position:50% align:center
She'll be fine.

00:07:22.108 --> 00:07:23.276 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Okay, then.

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:25.653 position:50% align:center
I wanna see Togata
before I leave, though.

00:07:25.737 --> 00:07:28.448 position:50% align:center
I'll be right back.
Please watch my stuff!

00:07:28.531 --> 00:07:30.909 position:50% align:center
Hold on. We're leaving soon.

00:07:39.542 --> 00:07:41.711 position:50% align:center
Are you in there?
It's me, Midoriya.

00:07:41.795 --> 00:07:44.714 position:50% align:center
Heya, my main man!

00:07:44.798 --> 00:07:46.424 position:50% align:center
You must be heading
back to campus, huh?

00:07:46.508 --> 00:07:48.593 position:50% align:center
I hear I'm the only one who's
gotta stay in the hospital.

00:07:48.677 --> 00:07:49.803 position:50% align:center
I don't get it.

00:07:49.886 --> 00:07:51.721 position:50% align:center
Like, come on, look how
much energy I have.

00:07:51.805 --> 00:07:54.015 position:50% align:center
It's kinda lame, amiright?

00:07:54.099 --> 00:07:55.517 position:50% align:center
Are you okay?

00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:57.602 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I know, I know.

00:07:57.686 --> 00:07:59.104 position:50% align:center
I lost my permeation.

00:07:59.187 --> 00:08:01.147 position:50% align:center
And my mentor just passed away.

00:08:01.231 --> 00:08:04.484 position:50% align:center
I should be full of mopes,
right, not smiling so much.

00:08:04.567 --> 00:08:06.236 position:50% align:center
But that's the thing.

00:08:09.406 --> 00:08:10.532 position:50% align:center
Sir loved to laugh.

00:08:10.615 --> 00:08:12.242 position:50% align:center
I know he was super
strict with you,

00:08:12.325 --> 00:08:13.785 position:50% align:center
but I got to see a
different side of him,

00:08:13.868 --> 00:08:16.329 position:50% align:center
that always tried to find
the humor in things.

00:08:17.789 --> 00:08:21.543 position:50% align:center
And be sure to smile.

00:08:21.626 --> 00:08:24.462 position:50% align:center
After all, without
joy and laughter

00:08:24.546 --> 00:08:28.091 position:50% align:center
to balance the sorrow,
this world cannot hope

00:08:28.174 --> 00:08:32.137 position:50% align:center
to have a bright future.

00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:33.346 position:50% align:center
[MIRIO]
So you see.

00:08:33.430 --> 00:08:35.557 position:50% align:center
I refuse to sit around crying.

00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:38.727 position:50% align:center
Because I gotta focus on
becoming a fine hero one day.

00:08:38.810 --> 00:08:41.896 position:50% align:center
Know what I mean?

00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:43.732 position:50% align:center
Plus, if I've got
a gloomy face on,

00:08:43.815 --> 00:08:46.151 position:50% align:center
it might make little
Eri feel sad.

00:08:48.528 --> 00:08:50.321 position:50% align:center
[SIR NIGHTEYE] You have the
power to become a symbol,

00:08:50.405 --> 00:08:52.032 position:50% align:center
but you're mediocre.

00:08:52.115 --> 00:08:54.701 position:50% align:center
Pity. All Might
chose wrong after all.

00:08:54.784 --> 00:08:57.454 position:50% align:center
Mirio should have
inherited the power.

00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:01.166 position:50% align:center
You are amazing.

00:09:01.249 --> 00:09:03.626 position:50% align:center
You protected Eri
the whole time.

00:09:03.710 --> 00:09:08.548 position:50% align:center
Even after your Quirk
was taken away.

00:09:08.631 --> 00:09:10.258 position:50% align:center
But I couldn't do that.

00:09:10.342 --> 00:09:12.969 position:50% align:center
You kept that scared little girl
safe all on your own,

00:09:13.053 --> 00:09:16.598 position:50% align:center
but I had to have help
from her and Mr. Aizawa.

00:09:16.681 --> 00:09:19.601 position:50% align:center
If you had been the successor
instead of me, then...

00:09:19.684 --> 00:09:22.604 position:50% align:center
...maybe Nighteye
would be alive.

00:09:22.687 --> 00:09:26.358 position:50% align:center
And maybe All Might's
future would be different.

00:09:26.441 --> 00:09:28.693 position:50% align:center
Togata! If I told you
there was some way

00:09:28.777 --> 00:09:31.196 position:50% align:center
that I could give you my
Quirk, then, would you--

00:09:31.279 --> 00:09:33.907 position:50% align:center
Nah, I wouldn't want it.

00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:35.158 position:50% align:center
If that were really possible,

00:09:35.241 --> 00:09:37.118 position:50% align:center
and you could just hand
your ability over to me,

00:09:37.202 --> 00:09:38.787 position:50% align:center
I would be causing you
a bunch of trouble,

00:09:38.870 --> 00:09:40.413 position:50% align:center
wouldn't I? Not cool.

00:09:40.497 --> 00:09:43.041 position:50% align:center
I wouldn't want you to end up
being bummed out. Right?

00:09:43.124 --> 00:09:46.002 position:50% align:center
I don't know why you talk
like ya did something wrong.

00:09:46.086 --> 00:09:50.173 position:50% align:center
You did a good job!
You're a hero, Deku!

00:09:54.094 --> 00:09:55.720 position:50% align:center
And besides.

00:09:55.804 --> 00:09:57.722 position:50% align:center
Yesterday, Eraser
told me about Eri

00:09:57.806 --> 00:09:59.974 position:50% align:center
and how her power works.

00:10:00.058 --> 00:10:02.435 position:50% align:center
Later, as she gets
older and trains,

00:10:02.519 --> 00:10:05.021 position:50% align:center
she may be able to use
her Quirk properly.

00:10:05.105 --> 00:10:07.649 position:50% align:center
Then I'll try asking her
if she can rewind me

00:10:07.732 --> 00:10:11.486 position:50% align:center
to when I still had Permeation.

00:10:11.569 --> 00:10:13.405 position:50% align:center
Even if that doesn't work,

00:10:13.488 --> 00:10:14.906 position:50% align:center
I'm not gonna give up
looking for ways

00:10:14.989 --> 00:10:16.825 position:50% align:center
to return to normal!

00:10:16.908 --> 00:10:18.243 position:50% align:center
I'll probably have
to take some time off

00:10:18.326 --> 00:10:21.204 position:50% align:center
from classes at UA until
my Quirk comes back.

00:10:21.287 --> 00:10:24.290 position:50% align:center
But don't worry about me,
I'm gonna be just fine!

00:10:24.374 --> 00:10:26.292 position:50% align:center
[SIR NIGHTEYE]
You'll be okay.

00:10:26.376 --> 00:10:29.504 position:50% align:center
You're going to become
the finest hero

00:10:29.587 --> 00:10:32.924 position:50% align:center
the world's ever seen.

00:10:33.008 --> 00:10:34.300 position:50% align:center
[MIRIO]
After all,

00:10:34.384 --> 00:10:36.970 position:50% align:center
I have to believe Sir's
prediction will come true.

00:10:37.053 --> 00:10:38.555 position:50% align:center
So do me a favor.

00:10:38.638 --> 00:10:41.016 position:50% align:center
Let's both keep smiling.

00:10:43.893 --> 00:10:45.270 position:50% align:center
Okay.

00:10:45.353 --> 00:10:47.439 position:50% align:center
I promise I won't
give up on UA.

00:10:47.522 --> 00:10:50.275 position:50% align:center
Because I'm the hero
who'll save a million people.

00:10:50.358 --> 00:10:53.528 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Good. I'll be waiting for you.

00:10:58.783 --> 00:11:00.827 position:50% align:center
[KIRISHIMA]
Midoriya!

00:11:00.910 --> 00:11:02.579 position:50% align:center
Did you get all healed up?

00:11:02.662 --> 00:11:05.457 position:50% align:center
Yeah. I'm all good
now. Thank you.

00:11:05.540 --> 00:11:09.044 position:50% align:center
[POLICE OFFICER 78A] Izuku
Midoriya and Eijiro Kirishima?

00:11:09.127 --> 00:11:11.713 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry to bother you two
right after your discharge.

00:11:11.796 --> 00:11:14.215 position:50% align:center
But we'd like you to come
down to the station with us.

00:11:14.299 --> 00:11:16.718 position:50% align:center
We have some questions
for you about the incident.

00:11:16.801 --> 00:11:17.635 position:50% align:center
Yes, sir.

00:11:17.719 --> 00:11:19.637 position:50% align:center
Anything you need.

00:11:19.721 --> 00:11:21.598 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] With that,
our return to the dorms

00:11:21.681 --> 00:11:23.850 position:50% align:center
was delayed even further.

00:11:27.270 --> 00:11:28.938 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Meanwhile, the rest of Class-A

00:11:29.022 --> 00:11:30.648 position:50% align:center
carried on as usual.

00:11:30.732 --> 00:11:31.691 position:50% align:center
[TODOROKI]
It's time, Bakugo.

00:11:31.775 --> 00:11:33.985 position:50% align:center
[KATSUKI]
Shut up, I'm coming.

00:11:34.069 --> 00:11:36.071 position:50% align:center
We can't be late getting
to the training course.

00:11:36.154 --> 00:11:40.492 position:50% align:center
[KATSUKI] I know. And don't
walk in front of me!

00:11:49.501 --> 00:11:51.461 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] Thanks to the police
questions and the paperwork

00:11:51.544 --> 00:11:53.380 position:50% align:center
that had to be done
following the raid,

00:11:53.463 --> 00:11:54.839 position:50% align:center
we didn't end up
getting back to the dorm

00:11:54.923 --> 00:11:56.966 position:50% align:center
until the sun had gone down.

00:11:58.385 --> 00:12:01.471 position:50% align:center
[OCHACO]
Deku! Kirishima!

00:12:01.554 --> 00:12:03.139 position:50% align:center
[KIRISHIMA]
Uraraka! Tsu!

00:12:03.223 --> 00:12:04.933 position:50% align:center
Oh, wow, are you two
girls just getting back

00:12:05.016 --> 00:12:06.142 position:50% align:center
to the dorms now, too?

00:12:06.226 --> 00:12:07.352 position:50% align:center
Yup!

00:12:07.435 --> 00:12:08.687 position:50% align:center
[TSUYU] There were a lot
of last-minute forms

00:12:08.770 --> 00:12:10.522 position:50% align:center
to fill out at Ryukyu's office.

00:12:10.605 --> 00:12:12.774 position:50% align:center
We did that, too.

00:12:12.857 --> 00:12:14.275 position:50% align:center
You know what's weird?

00:12:14.359 --> 00:12:17.237 position:50% align:center
It feels like we haven't been
back here in a long time.

00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:19.531 position:50% align:center
[TSUYU]
Yeah.

00:12:19.614 --> 00:12:21.866 position:50% align:center
[KIRISHIMA]
Well? Let's go.

00:12:26.037 --> 00:12:27.956 position:50% align:center
Oh, there you guys are!

00:12:28.039 --> 00:12:29.666 position:50% align:center
It's about time you showed up!

00:12:29.749 --> 00:12:30.959 position:50% align:center
[YAOYOROZU] All of us
were worried about you.

00:12:31.042 --> 00:12:32.168 position:50% align:center
[KAMINARI]
Yeah, we saw the news.

00:12:32.252 --> 00:12:33.294 position:50% align:center
[ASHIDO]
It looked terrifying!

00:12:33.378 --> 00:12:34.879 position:50% align:center
[SERO]
Is anyone hurt?

00:12:34.963 --> 00:12:36.798 position:50% align:center
--[MINETA] What troublemakers.
--[AOYAMA] Tell us everything!

00:12:36.881 --> 00:12:37.924 position:50% align:center
I made this for you.

00:12:38.008 --> 00:12:39.426 position:50% align:center
It's a double chocolate cake.

00:12:39.509 --> 00:12:41.177 position:50% align:center
First Kamino and now the yakuza.

00:12:41.261 --> 00:12:43.805 position:50% align:center
You guys are always getting
into such crazy situations.

00:12:43.888 --> 00:12:45.306 position:50% align:center
Do you know how much
that scares us?

00:12:45.390 --> 00:12:47.058 position:50% align:center
Yeah. We're so sorry.

00:12:47.142 --> 00:12:48.435 position:50% align:center
I'm just glad they're okay.

00:12:48.518 --> 00:12:53.565 position:50% align:center
I mean, I dunno. Are they?
How can we be sure?

00:12:53.648 --> 00:12:55.108 position:50% align:center
[HAGAKURE]
Ochaco! Tsu!

00:12:55.191 --> 00:12:56.985 position:50% align:center
Thank goodness you're both okay!

00:12:57.068 --> 00:12:58.486 position:50% align:center
That's a little tight.

00:12:58.570 --> 00:12:59.946 position:50% align:center
Ribbit.

00:13:04.784 --> 00:13:06.619 position:50% align:center
[TENYA]
Enough of this.

00:13:06.703 --> 00:13:08.538 position:50% align:center
I know everyone was worried.

00:13:08.621 --> 00:13:10.123 position:50% align:center
But calm down!

00:13:10.206 --> 00:13:12.000 position:50% align:center
We all saw news coverage.

00:13:12.083 --> 00:13:14.210 position:50% align:center
Our classmates have
been through an ordeal.

00:13:14.294 --> 00:13:15.545 position:50% align:center
If you want to help,

00:13:15.628 --> 00:13:16.921 position:50% align:center
you should console them quietly

00:13:17.005 --> 00:13:19.424 position:50% align:center
and let them rest their
bodies and their minds.

00:13:19.507 --> 00:13:20.967 position:50% align:center
Because I'm sure
today wasn't taxing

00:13:21.051 --> 00:13:23.720 position:50% align:center
just physically,
but mentally as well!

00:13:24.888 --> 00:13:28.808 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Hey, um. Iida.

00:13:28.892 --> 00:13:32.312 position:50% align:center
Thanks for that. But really.

00:13:34.606 --> 00:13:38.360 position:50% align:center
Let's both keep smiling.

00:13:38.443 --> 00:13:40.445 position:50% align:center
This is okay.

00:13:41.446 --> 00:13:43.365 position:50% align:center
Then... If I may.

00:13:43.448 --> 00:13:45.825 position:50% align:center
Do you have any idea how
worried I was for all of you?

00:13:45.909 --> 00:13:48.411 position:50% align:center
It was awful! What if
you never returned?

00:13:48.495 --> 00:13:50.663 position:50% align:center
Take your own advice
and chill out!

00:13:50.747 --> 00:13:52.540 position:50% align:center
I'll go make some lavender tea.

00:13:52.624 --> 00:13:54.834 position:50% align:center
One moment. It's sure
to ease your minds.

00:13:54.918 --> 00:13:57.295 position:50% align:center
At least have a little
bit of the cake.

00:13:57.379 --> 00:13:59.881 position:50% align:center
[TSUYU]
Ochaco, you all right?

00:14:02.717 --> 00:14:04.678 position:50% align:center
[OCHACO]
It's just...

00:14:04.761 --> 00:14:05.679 position:50% align:center
I can't help but think

00:14:05.762 --> 00:14:09.099 position:50% align:center
that I could have
done more. I...

00:14:09.182 --> 00:14:11.267 position:50% align:center
I held Nighteye in my arms.

00:14:11.351 --> 00:14:14.479 position:50% align:center
What if I'd been
faster or stronger.

00:14:17.691 --> 00:14:19.067 position:50% align:center
[AIZAWA]
Listen to me.

00:14:19.150 --> 00:14:21.861 position:50% align:center
Each of you did everything
within your power.

00:14:21.945 --> 00:14:24.948 position:50% align:center
The responsibility
for this lies with us.

00:14:25.031 --> 00:14:27.075 position:50% align:center
I won't tell you
to not to mourn.

00:14:27.158 --> 00:14:28.702 position:50% align:center
But I do want you
to think about whether

00:14:28.785 --> 00:14:31.121 position:50% align:center
this is what you want
your future to be.

00:14:31.204 --> 00:14:33.081 position:50% align:center
What do you want?

00:14:34.457 --> 00:14:38.378 position:50% align:center
I want to--to save people.

00:14:41.798 --> 00:14:43.383 position:50% align:center
Ugh, why the heck
didn't you tell us

00:14:43.466 --> 00:14:44.759 position:50% align:center
what was goin' on, man?

00:14:44.843 --> 00:14:46.970 position:50% align:center
We were totally
blindsided by this.

00:14:47.053 --> 00:14:50.015 position:50% align:center
Sorry. We were sworn to secrecy.

00:14:50.098 --> 00:14:53.852 position:50% align:center
[ASHIDO]
Hey, so... I'm glad you're okay.

00:14:53.935 --> 00:14:55.812 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Getting there anyway.

00:14:55.895 --> 00:14:56.855 position:50% align:center
Right. Got it.

00:14:56.938 --> 00:14:58.690 position:50% align:center
Oh! What a cutie!

00:14:58.773 --> 00:15:00.525 position:50% align:center
Oh, it's Koda's bunny.

00:15:00.608 --> 00:15:02.193 position:50% align:center
Do you guys wanna hold it
for a little while?

00:15:02.277 --> 00:15:03.028 position:50% align:center
Ribbit.

00:15:03.111 --> 00:15:04.279 position:50% align:center
[HAGAKURE]
Ooh, me next!

00:15:04.362 --> 00:15:05.989 position:50% align:center
[OCHACO]
Adorable!

00:15:06.072 --> 00:15:07.115 position:50% align:center
[KAMINARI]
Yo, Kacchan.

00:15:07.198 --> 00:15:08.950 position:50% align:center
What're you over
here sulking for?

00:15:09.034 --> 00:15:09.951 position:50% align:center
Admit it, you're out here

00:15:10.035 --> 00:15:11.453 position:50% align:center
'cause you were
worried, amiright?

00:15:11.536 --> 00:15:13.371 position:50% align:center
Aw, let those feelings
out, why don't ya?

00:15:13.455 --> 00:15:14.664 position:50% align:center
Time for bed.

00:15:14.748 --> 00:15:17.417 position:50% align:center
[KAMINARI] What? Seriously?
But it's so early.

00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:20.754 position:50% align:center
Unlike the rest of you nerds,
I've got stuff to do.

00:15:20.837 --> 00:15:21.963 position:50% align:center
Hey, you guys.

00:15:22.047 --> 00:15:23.590 position:50% align:center
I'm glad you're all back
and everyone's safe,

00:15:23.673 --> 00:15:25.133 position:50% align:center
but I gotta get to bed.

00:15:25.216 --> 00:15:26.217 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:15:26.301 --> 00:15:28.053 position:50% align:center
Since when am I
surrounded by geezers?

00:15:28.136 --> 00:15:30.180 position:50% align:center
I understand Bakugo,
but Todoroki

00:15:30.263 --> 00:15:32.265 position:50% align:center
wants to leave the party
this early, too?

00:15:32.349 --> 00:15:33.767 position:50% align:center
They've got their
provisional license

00:15:33.850 --> 00:15:38.563 position:50% align:center
training course tomorrow.
But still, it is pretty early.

00:15:38.646 --> 00:15:41.191 position:50% align:center
I get it.

00:15:41.274 --> 00:15:42.734 position:50% align:center
Kacchan and Todoroki
have already

00:15:42.817 --> 00:15:45.070 position:50% align:center
started their remedial courses.

00:15:45.153 --> 00:15:47.238 position:50% align:center
They must be working hard.

00:15:49.616 --> 00:15:51.618 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] At the urging
of Iida and the others,

00:15:51.701 --> 00:15:54.829 position:50% align:center
we went back to our rooms
to try and get some rest.

00:15:54.913 --> 00:15:59.167 position:50% align:center
We finally had time to reflect
on what we'd been through.

00:15:59.250 --> 00:16:00.502 position:50% align:center
I only heard the
highlights about

00:16:00.585 --> 00:16:04.381 position:50% align:center
what had gone down with
Kirishima and the others.

00:16:04.464 --> 00:16:07.842 position:50% align:center
But I knew a lot had
happened to everyone.

00:16:07.926 --> 00:16:10.970 position:50% align:center
No, too much had happened.

00:16:17.268 --> 00:16:20.647 position:50% align:center
[ERI]
Please. Please don't go.

00:16:20.730 --> 00:16:22.982 position:50% align:center
We'll get Eri away
from him next time...

00:16:23.066 --> 00:16:25.235 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU, MIRIO]
...and we'll protect her!

00:16:25.318 --> 00:16:29.489 position:50% align:center
I swear it. I am
going to be your hero!

00:16:29.572 --> 00:16:31.991 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Even if it's set in stone...

00:16:32.075 --> 00:16:34.285 position:50% align:center
I'll smash that future!

00:16:34.369 --> 00:16:37.247 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Got you. I won't let you go.

00:16:37.330 --> 00:16:39.582 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU yells]

00:16:39.666 --> 00:16:42.585 position:50% align:center
[CHISAKI] She has the
power to rewind people.

00:16:42.669 --> 00:16:44.295 position:50% align:center
That's her secret.

00:16:44.379 --> 00:16:47.757 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] Eri, will you please
lend me your power?

00:16:47.841 --> 00:16:49.884 position:50% align:center
If I can't save Eri...

00:16:49.968 --> 00:16:53.513 position:50% align:center
...one small child who's
relying on me to help her...

00:16:53.596 --> 00:16:56.057 position:50% align:center
...then how can I call myself

00:16:56.141 --> 00:16:59.644 position:50% align:center
a hero who saves everybody?

00:16:59.728 --> 00:17:03.481 position:50% align:center
That's who I'm gonna be!

00:17:06.776 --> 00:17:11.322 position:50% align:center
[SIR NIGHTEYE] Midoriya.
You twisted the future.

00:17:11.406 --> 00:17:13.825 position:50% align:center
You did the impossible.

00:17:13.908 --> 00:17:18.747 position:50% align:center
Work hard. And be sure to smile.

00:17:20.999 --> 00:17:25.462 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] Even though
my body was exhausted,

00:17:25.545 --> 00:17:26.671 position:50% align:center
that night,

00:17:26.755 --> 00:17:29.674 position:50% align:center
I couldn't actually
get myself to sleep.

00:17:39.392 --> 00:17:41.061 position:50% align:center
Walk behind me, dammit!

00:17:41.144 --> 00:17:42.687 position:50% align:center
Poor Mr. Aizawa.

00:17:42.771 --> 00:17:44.272 position:50% align:center
I feel bad making him train us

00:17:44.356 --> 00:17:45.940 position:50% align:center
after everything he
just went through.

00:17:46.024 --> 00:17:48.443 position:50% align:center
I'm not gonna make small
talk with you, icy hot!

00:17:48.526 --> 00:17:50.528 position:50% align:center
You should--

00:17:50.612 --> 00:17:53.323 position:50% align:center
You're late! Ya bad boys!

00:17:53.406 --> 00:17:54.866 position:50% align:center
[TODOROKI]
Present Mic. All Might.

00:17:54.949 --> 00:17:56.201 position:50% align:center
Why're you here?

00:17:56.284 --> 00:17:59.621 position:50% align:center
[ALL MIGHT] We'll be taking
you to training today.

00:17:59.704 --> 00:18:01.331 position:50% align:center
Eraser's gonna be playin' hookee

00:18:01.414 --> 00:18:03.166 position:50% align:center
thanks to all the
yakuza chart-toppers

00:18:03.249 --> 00:18:04.834 position:50% align:center
who were taken down yesterday.

00:18:04.918 --> 00:18:06.961 position:50% align:center
Oh, is he injured
worse than we thought?

00:18:07.045 --> 00:18:08.713 position:50% align:center
[PRESENT MIC] Nah. Apparently,
they needed his power

00:18:08.797 --> 00:18:10.757 position:50% align:center
to help with the
girl they rescued.

00:18:10.840 --> 00:18:16.137 position:50% align:center
Don't worry, I'm all over this.
Consider me your new bodyguard!

00:18:16.221 --> 00:18:20.392 position:50% align:center
We're taking extra precautions
due to the League's activity.

00:18:20.475 --> 00:18:21.935 position:50% align:center
[ALL MIGHT]
You captured Kurogiri?

00:18:22.018 --> 00:18:23.478 position:50% align:center
Their warp gate?

00:18:23.561 --> 00:18:24.854 position:50% align:center
[GRAN TORINO]
That's right.

00:18:24.938 --> 00:18:27.315 position:50% align:center
Though, we took some hard
hits during the process.

00:18:27.399 --> 00:18:29.776 position:50% align:center
[ALL MIGHT] Well, the League
should practically be ours

00:18:29.859 --> 00:18:32.362 position:50% align:center
for the taking if that
one's out of commission.

00:18:32.445 --> 00:18:34.823 position:50% align:center
[GRAN TORINO] Not quite.
We didn't get the other guy.

00:18:34.906 --> 00:18:36.157 position:50% align:center
The one with him.

00:18:36.241 --> 00:18:37.367 position:50% align:center
[ALL MIGHT]
Who was it?

00:18:37.450 --> 00:18:40.537 position:50% align:center
All For One's direct
subordinate, it seems.

00:18:41.788 --> 00:18:46.167 position:50% align:center
[GRAN TORINO] We tried our best,
but he's gone into hiding.

00:18:46.251 --> 00:18:48.336 position:50% align:center
Honestly, between
arresting Kurogiri

00:18:48.420 --> 00:18:50.088 position:50% align:center
and letting that monstrosity go,

00:18:50.171 --> 00:18:52.924 position:50% align:center
it's hard to say if we
made the right choice.

00:18:53.008 --> 00:18:55.635 position:50% align:center
You should have
seen him, Toshinori.

00:19:00.724 --> 00:19:03.101 position:50% align:center
[GRAN TORINO]
He's a walking disaster.

00:19:04.352 --> 00:19:06.062 position:50% align:center
[GRAN TORINO]
We chased after him with backup,

00:19:06.146 --> 00:19:07.439 position:50% align:center
but it was too late.

00:19:07.522 --> 00:19:09.524 position:50% align:center
The search is still going on.

00:19:09.607 --> 00:19:12.152 position:50% align:center
I'll let you know if there
are any developments.

00:19:16.406 --> 00:19:18.283 position:50% align:center
Right. Let's go.

00:19:18.366 --> 00:19:20.827 position:50% align:center
Yesterday was an easy
classroom lecture for you,

00:19:20.910 --> 00:19:23.538 position:50% align:center
but I hear today's training
will be far tougher.

00:19:24.956 --> 00:19:26.249 position:50% align:center
Let's get this party started,

00:19:26.332 --> 00:19:28.793 position:50% align:center
so you can get your licenses
already, mah brothers!

00:19:28.877 --> 00:19:30.211 position:50% align:center
[KATSUKI growls]

00:19:30.295 --> 00:19:31.588 position:50% align:center
[ALL MIGHT]
We don't wanna be late.

00:19:31.671 --> 00:19:33.673 position:50% align:center
Come on. Climb in.

00:19:35.467 --> 00:19:38.678 position:50% align:center
[TODOROKI] So All Might's
going to be joining us today.

00:19:38.762 --> 00:19:41.264 position:50% align:center
That might not be the best idea.

00:19:42.599 --> 00:19:44.601 position:50% align:center
[ALL MIGHT] We'll be watching
you from the stands.

00:19:44.684 --> 00:19:47.354 position:50% align:center
[PRESENT MIC]
Do your best! Yeah!

00:19:49.689 --> 00:19:54.986 position:50% align:center
[ENDEAVOR] Oh. If it isn't
the former number-one hero.

00:19:55.070 --> 00:19:59.407 position:50% align:center
Thanks for babysitting
Shoto. You're so useful.

00:19:59.491 --> 00:20:01.534 position:50% align:center
Endeavor.

00:20:01.618 --> 00:20:03.036 position:50% align:center
This is perfect.

00:20:03.119 --> 00:20:04.954 position:50% align:center
I've been wanting to
sit down and have a chat

00:20:05.038 --> 00:20:07.624 position:50% align:center
with you man-to-man for a while.

00:20:12.796 --> 00:20:15.965 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna go find
some coffee. Deuces!

00:20:21.763 --> 00:20:23.890 position:50% align:center
[ENDEAVOR]
Shoto! Great news!

00:20:23.973 --> 00:20:25.600 position:50% align:center
I've got some free time!

00:20:25.684 --> 00:20:28.395 position:50% align:center
How about I come watch
your training tomorrow?

00:20:28.478 --> 00:20:29.854 position:50% align:center
It's been t--

00:20:30.855 --> 00:20:32.732 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:20:34.317 --> 00:20:35.360 position:50% align:center
[TODOROKI]
I hope the two of them

00:20:35.443 --> 00:20:38.571 position:50% align:center
don't run into
each other. Also...

00:20:38.655 --> 00:20:39.531 position:50% align:center
[YOARASHI]
Oh!

00:20:39.614 --> 00:20:43.201 position:50% align:center
Hey! It's UA!

00:20:44.452 --> 00:20:47.205 position:50% align:center
I just can't help but hate
both you and your dad.

00:20:47.288 --> 00:20:48.331 position:50% align:center
You've changed a little,

00:20:48.415 --> 00:20:51.459 position:50% align:center
but you definitely
still have his eyes.

00:20:51.543 --> 00:20:54.337 position:50% align:center
[TODOROKI] I was hoping
I wouldn't run into him.

00:20:54.421 --> 00:20:59.175 position:50% align:center
[CAMIE] Ooh! Who's this
smoldery-looking two-toned boy?

00:20:59.259 --> 00:21:00.802 position:50% align:center
You're, like, super hot.

00:21:00.885 --> 00:21:03.972 position:50% align:center
I'm crazy psyched to train
with a total babe like you.

00:21:04.055 --> 00:21:05.181 position:50% align:center
[YOARASHI]
Camie.

00:21:05.265 --> 00:21:06.099 position:50% align:center
[CAMIE]
Hey, Yoarashi.

00:21:06.182 --> 00:21:07.475 position:50% align:center
Do you know him or something?

00:21:07.559 --> 00:21:09.185 position:50% align:center
Seriously, can I like,
have your number?

00:21:09.269 --> 00:21:10.353 position:50% align:center
[TODOROKI]
Uh, sure.

00:21:10.437 --> 00:21:12.397 position:50% align:center
Camie, your social
skills are top-notch!

00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:13.773 position:50% align:center
I'm so impressed!

00:21:13.857 --> 00:21:15.025 position:50% align:center
Hey. Baldy.

00:21:15.108 --> 00:21:17.277 position:50% align:center
This girl didn't train
with us before, did she?

00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:18.987 position:50% align:center
[YOARASHI]
Correct! She wasn't here.

00:21:19.070 --> 00:21:20.739 position:50% align:center
Oh, and I'm not bald, see!

00:21:20.822 --> 00:21:22.991 position:50% align:center
Camie, This is beneath you!

00:21:23.074 --> 00:21:24.367 position:50% align:center
As a Shiketsu student,

00:21:24.451 --> 00:21:26.327 position:50% align:center
you mustn't fraternize
with such failures.

00:21:26.411 --> 00:21:28.788 position:50% align:center
Hold on! You failed the
first test we took, loser!

00:21:28.872 --> 00:21:30.331 position:50% align:center
I received permission
to observe,

00:21:30.415 --> 00:21:31.291 position:50% align:center
so I'm here to judge you!

00:21:31.374 --> 00:21:32.417 position:50% align:center
Stupid Meat, you're dead!

00:21:32.500 --> 00:21:34.169 position:50% align:center
The name's Seiji Shishikura!

00:21:34.252 --> 00:21:35.837 position:50% align:center
[CAMIE]
Wait, you're Endeavor's son.

00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:38.465 position:50% align:center
You're hero royalty
on top of being a snack?

00:21:38.548 --> 00:21:40.300 position:50% align:center
That's so totally amazing!

00:21:40.383 --> 00:21:42.510 position:50% align:center
Look at that!
She's just so bold.

00:21:42.594 --> 00:21:44.220 position:50% align:center
[SHISHIKURA]
Get away from him!

00:21:45.722 --> 00:21:48.224 position:50% align:center
[MERA]
It's about time we got started.

00:21:48.308 --> 00:21:50.018 position:50% align:center
[GANG ORCA]
Yes.

00:21:50.101 --> 00:21:52.270 position:50% align:center
[MERA]
Shall we make today's training

00:21:52.354 --> 00:21:54.856 position:50% align:center
a little bit more interesting?

00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:31.661 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Here's the preview!

00:23:31.745 --> 00:23:34.247 position:50% align:center
As part of their provisional
hero license training,

00:23:34.330 --> 00:23:37.417 position:50% align:center
Kacchan and Todoroki are
at the mercy of Gang Orca.

00:23:37.500 --> 00:23:38.835 position:50% align:center
Unfortunately for them,

00:23:38.918 --> 00:23:41.713 position:50% align:center
he's got an outrageous
trial planned.

00:23:41.796 --> 00:23:43.381 position:50% align:center
I think Todoroki will be fine,

00:23:43.465 --> 00:23:46.593 position:50% align:center
but I'm kinda worried
about Kacchan!

00:23:46.676 --> 00:23:49.429 position:50% align:center
Next time: "Win
Those Kids' Hearts"!

00:23:49.512 --> 00:23:51.848 position:50% align:center
As the students train,
will All Might tell Endeavor

00:23:51.931 --> 00:23:54.100 position:50% align:center
what it means to be number one?

00:23:54.184 --> 00:23:56.853 position:50% align:center
Go beyond! Plus Ultra!
