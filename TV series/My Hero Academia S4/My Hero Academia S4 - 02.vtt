00:00:09.884 --> 00:00:12.012 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] This world is
a superhuman society,

00:00:12.095 --> 00:00:14.472 position:50% align:center
with about 80 percent of
the population possessing

00:00:14.556 --> 00:00:17.892 position:50% align:center
some uncanny ability
called a "Quirk."

00:00:17.976 --> 00:00:20.061 position:50% align:center
Those who stand up against
villains who abuse

00:00:20.145 --> 00:00:23.064 position:50% align:center
their powers for evil
are called heroes.

00:00:23.148 --> 00:00:25.025 position:50% align:center
They are our champions.

00:00:28.069 --> 00:00:30.071 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
My name is Izuku Midoriya,

00:00:30.155 --> 00:00:32.782 position:50% align:center
and I've always dreamed
of being a hero.

00:00:32.866 --> 00:00:35.910 position:50% align:center
So I enrolled in the
prestigious UA High School.

00:00:35.994 --> 00:00:37.412 position:50% align:center
Even though I've been
caught up in some

00:00:37.495 --> 00:00:39.539 position:50% align:center
harrowing incidents
since I started there,

00:00:39.622 --> 00:00:42.208 position:50% align:center
I was able to pass the
provisional licensing exam

00:00:42.292 --> 00:00:44.127 position:50% align:center
as a first-year student.

00:00:45.795 --> 00:00:51.301 position:50% align:center
[phone ringing]

00:00:51.384 --> 00:00:53.595 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] The next big
thing I'm aiming for

00:00:53.678 --> 00:00:56.348 position:50% align:center
is to participate in a
hero work study program,

00:00:56.431 --> 00:00:57.599 position:50% align:center
where I'll get
the chance to serve

00:00:57.682 --> 00:01:00.435 position:50% align:center
under an actual pro
at their agency.

00:01:00.518 --> 00:01:02.479 position:50% align:center
Huh? Work study?

00:01:02.562 --> 00:01:03.980 position:50% align:center
Wait, who is this again?

00:01:04.064 --> 00:01:07.108 position:50% align:center
Will you be taking anyone
for the program, Gran Torino?

00:01:07.192 --> 00:01:08.360 position:50% align:center
Sorry, kid.

00:01:08.443 --> 00:01:10.195 position:50% align:center
I'm working on something
else right now,

00:01:10.278 --> 00:01:11.905 position:50% align:center
so I can't help you out.

00:01:11.988 --> 00:01:13.573 position:50% align:center
Oh, wait, I know who you are.

00:01:13.656 --> 00:01:15.533 position:50% align:center
You're that useless
successor who failed

00:01:15.617 --> 00:01:16.618 position:50% align:center
at the sports festival.

00:01:16.701 --> 00:01:18.661 position:50% align:center
[yelps]

00:01:18.745 --> 00:01:20.663 position:50% align:center
I know that I've been useless.

00:01:20.747 --> 00:01:22.499 position:50% align:center
If I'm gonna be the
number-one hero,

00:01:22.582 --> 00:01:24.709 position:50% align:center
then I've gotta
work even harder!

00:01:24.793 --> 00:01:26.378 position:50% align:center
You know that All Might
can introduce you

00:01:26.461 --> 00:01:28.463 position:50% align:center
to a bunch of new
people, right, kid?

00:01:28.546 --> 00:01:31.716 position:50% align:center
First one who comes to mind
is his former sidekick.

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:33.968 position:50% align:center
His name's Nighteye.

00:03:05.435 --> 00:03:09.731 position:50% align:center
[CHISAKI coughs] The air's
practically made of dust here.

00:03:09.814 --> 00:03:11.775 position:50% align:center
It's gonna make me sick.

00:03:11.858 --> 00:03:12.984 position:50% align:center
[TWICE]
Join the club.

00:03:13.068 --> 00:03:15.945 position:50% align:center
The guys inside have
been sick for a while.

00:03:22.994 --> 00:03:24.162 position:50% align:center
[SHIGARAKI]
Well, now.

00:03:24.245 --> 00:03:28.166 position:50% align:center
You brought us a pretty
big catch, huh, Twice?

00:03:28.249 --> 00:03:31.711 position:50% align:center
[CHISAKI] You think so?
Strange, coming from you.

00:03:31.795 --> 00:03:33.213 position:50% align:center
The League of Villains.

00:03:33.296 --> 00:03:36.132 position:50% align:center
What gives? Is this guy
famous or something?

00:03:36.216 --> 00:03:39.344 position:50% align:center
[SHIGARAKI] My Master showed
me a picture of him.

00:03:39.427 --> 00:03:42.055 position:50% align:center
He's what you'd call "yakuza."

00:03:43.056 --> 00:03:45.767 position:50% align:center
[SHIGARAKI] The young head
of the Shie Hassaikai.

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:47.560 position:50% align:center
To what do we owe the pleasure?

00:03:52.107 --> 00:03:55.110 position:50% align:center
[MAGNE] He's the number
two of the whole gang?

00:03:55.193 --> 00:03:57.487 position:50% align:center
Ooh, I've never met anyone
like him before!

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:00.699 position:50% align:center
He smells so dangerous.
How exciting.

00:04:00.782 --> 00:04:02.200 position:50% align:center
What's the deal?

00:04:02.283 --> 00:04:04.994 position:50% align:center
We're all criminals here,
so how is this guy different?

00:04:05.078 --> 00:04:07.580 position:50% align:center
[MR. COMPRESS] Ah! Allow
me to tell you a story.

00:04:07.664 --> 00:04:09.416 position:50% align:center
In the past, there
were many different

00:04:09.499 --> 00:04:11.835 position:50% align:center
scary troupes that
ran the underworld.

00:04:11.918 --> 00:04:13.753 position:50% align:center
After heroes started
thriving, though,

00:04:13.837 --> 00:04:16.256 position:50% align:center
they slowly but surely
began to disband.

00:04:16.339 --> 00:04:19.759 position:50% align:center
When All Might took the
stage, their era was over.

00:04:19.843 --> 00:04:21.845 position:50% align:center
The yakuza survivors
who weren't caught

00:04:21.928 --> 00:04:24.472 position:50% align:center
became rent-a-thugs
for villain groups.

00:04:24.556 --> 00:04:26.433 position:50% align:center
In other words, they
were the lowest form

00:04:26.516 --> 00:04:30.395 position:50% align:center
of criminal, barely scraping
by to make a living.

00:04:30.478 --> 00:04:32.564 position:50% align:center
Frankly, they're obsolete.

00:04:32.647 --> 00:04:34.858 position:50% align:center
An endangered species.

00:04:34.941 --> 00:04:36.818 position:50% align:center
[CHISAKI]
Endangered species, huh?

00:04:36.901 --> 00:04:38.987 position:50% align:center
I guess that's true.

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:40.613 position:50% align:center
[MAGNE]
Yeah, what's a yakuza thug

00:04:40.697 --> 00:04:42.657 position:50% align:center
from the slums doing here?

00:04:42.741 --> 00:04:44.159 position:50% align:center
Lemme guess,
you're excited about

00:04:44.242 --> 00:04:45.952 position:50% align:center
All Might's retirement, too.

00:04:46.036 --> 00:04:48.288 position:50% align:center
[CHISAKI]
It's good that he's gone, sure.

00:04:48.371 --> 00:04:52.959 position:50% align:center
But I'm more interested
in All For One's absence.

00:04:53.043 --> 00:04:57.088 position:50% align:center
The dark emperor who
ruled over the shadows.

00:04:57.172 --> 00:04:59.090 position:50% align:center
The old-timers
always feared him.

00:04:59.174 --> 00:05:01.885 position:50% align:center
Even after rumors of his death.

00:05:01.968 --> 00:05:03.970 position:50% align:center
Honestly, though,
most people my age

00:05:04.054 --> 00:05:06.973 position:50% align:center
thought he was an urban legend.

00:05:07.057 --> 00:05:10.226 position:50% align:center
You can imagine the shock
when he showed up in the flesh.

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:16.941 position:50% align:center
[ALL MIGHT]
United States of Smash!

00:05:17.025 --> 00:05:19.652 position:50% align:center
[CHISAKI] But in the end,
the big bad was thrown

00:05:19.736 --> 00:05:23.323 position:50% align:center
into Tartarus and the
Symbol of Peace retired.

00:05:23.406 --> 00:05:25.450 position:50% align:center
Which means those
of us in the shadows

00:05:25.533 --> 00:05:28.453 position:50% align:center
and those in the light
are both leaderless.

00:05:28.536 --> 00:05:32.874 position:50% align:center
So, who will step up
to take their places?

00:05:32.957 --> 00:05:34.751 position:50% align:center
[SHIGARAKI]
You know who my master is,

00:05:34.834 --> 00:05:37.545 position:50% align:center
but you've still got
the nerve to ask that?

00:05:37.629 --> 00:05:40.173 position:50% align:center
Sounds like a challenge.

00:05:40.256 --> 00:05:42.217 position:50% align:center
I'm the next leader.

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:45.178 position:50% align:center
Even now, I'm
gathering my troops.

00:05:45.261 --> 00:05:47.931 position:50% align:center
Our numbers continue
to increase.

00:05:48.014 --> 00:05:53.520 position:50% align:center
With our combined power,
I'll turn hero society to dust.

00:05:53.603 --> 00:05:55.939 position:50% align:center
[CHISAKI]
You have an actual plan?

00:05:56.022 --> 00:05:59.984 position:50% align:center
[SHIGARAKI]
Watch your tongue and your tone.

00:06:00.068 --> 00:06:02.904 position:50% align:center
I thought you came here
to join up with us.

00:06:02.987 --> 00:06:06.491 position:50% align:center
[CHISAKI] A goal without
a plan is just a wish.

00:06:06.574 --> 00:06:09.744 position:50% align:center
If that's what you're offering,
why should I join you?

00:06:09.828 --> 00:06:12.455 position:50% align:center
What happens after you
increase your forces?

00:06:12.539 --> 00:06:16.501 position:50% align:center
Do you have any idea how you'd
even organize your League?

00:06:16.584 --> 00:06:19.629 position:50% align:center
You had the Hero Killer
Stain at your side.

00:06:19.713 --> 00:06:22.173 position:50% align:center
Muscular. Moonfish.

00:06:22.257 --> 00:06:25.135 position:50% align:center
All first-class game pieces.

00:06:25.218 --> 00:06:27.053 position:50% align:center
And you lost 'em.

00:06:27.137 --> 00:06:29.889 position:50% align:center
Maybe you just didn't know
how to play the game.

00:06:29.973 --> 00:06:32.267 position:50% align:center
You can't even manage
a few crazy people,

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:34.394 position:50% align:center
but you wanna build an army?

00:06:34.477 --> 00:06:38.648 position:50% align:center
What happens when that power
spirals out of control?

00:06:38.732 --> 00:06:41.818 position:50% align:center
You need direction
to achieve your goals.

00:06:41.901 --> 00:06:44.154 position:50% align:center
And I have a plan.

00:06:44.237 --> 00:06:48.074 position:50% align:center
I didn't come here today
because I wanted to join you.

00:06:48.158 --> 00:06:51.202 position:50% align:center
[SHIGARAKI] You brought
this idiot here without

00:06:51.286 --> 00:06:53.580 position:50% align:center
knowing his intentions, Twice.

00:06:53.663 --> 00:06:57.083 position:50% align:center
[CHISAKI] In order to execute
my design, I need money.

00:06:57.167 --> 00:06:59.210 position:50% align:center
Unfortunately, there
aren't many people

00:06:59.294 --> 00:07:01.129 position:50% align:center
looking to invest
in some obsolete,

00:07:01.212 --> 00:07:03.256 position:50% align:center
small-time yakuza.

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:05.383 position:50% align:center
Now, your group,
on the other hand,

00:07:05.467 --> 00:07:07.886 position:50% align:center
has widespread name recognition.

00:07:07.969 --> 00:07:09.512 position:50% align:center
Put yourself under me.

00:07:09.596 --> 00:07:11.556 position:50% align:center
Make me your new leader,

00:07:11.639 --> 00:07:15.226 position:50% align:center
and I'll show you exactly
how to use the right tools.

00:07:17.937 --> 00:07:19.898 position:50% align:center
[SHIGARAKI]
Leave.

00:07:19.981 --> 00:07:21.566 position:50% align:center
Sorry about ya, small fry.

00:07:21.649 --> 00:07:25.403 position:50% align:center
But we didn't band together
to serve under somebody's boot.

00:07:25.487 --> 00:07:26.654 position:50% align:center
[CHISAKI grunts]

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:29.908 position:50% align:center
The other day,

00:07:29.991 --> 00:07:32.327 position:50% align:center
I met with an old friend.

00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:33.953 position:50% align:center
She's a gentle soul.

00:07:34.037 --> 00:07:37.957 position:50% align:center
But she supports me, even
knowing about my past.

00:07:38.041 --> 00:07:39.626 position:50% align:center
You know what she said?

00:07:39.709 --> 00:07:42.003 position:50% align:center
"Those who're bound
by the chains of society

00:07:42.087 --> 00:07:44.631 position:50% align:center
laugh at those who aren't."

00:07:44.714 --> 00:07:45.924 position:50% align:center
[MAGNE'S FRIEND]
You, Kennie.

00:07:46.007 --> 00:07:48.176 position:50% align:center
You're not bound
by those chains.

00:07:48.259 --> 00:07:49.928 position:50% align:center
But I don't have the
courage to break away

00:07:50.011 --> 00:07:51.846 position:50% align:center
from them like you do.

00:07:51.930 --> 00:07:53.807 position:50% align:center
[MAGNE] I'm here because
I don't want to be bound

00:07:53.890 --> 00:07:55.475 position:50% align:center
by anything!

00:07:55.558 --> 00:07:57.352 position:50% align:center
We're free to
decide for ourselves

00:07:57.435 --> 00:07:59.396 position:50% align:center
exactly where we belong!

00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:12.200 position:50% align:center
No. Big Sis Mag!

00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:17.038 position:50% align:center
[CHISAKI] Just remember
you made the first move.

00:08:18.081 --> 00:08:20.458 position:50% align:center
[CHISAKI]
Ugh. I'm filthy now.

00:08:20.542 --> 00:08:23.169 position:50% align:center
That's why I hate the aftermath.

00:08:24.337 --> 00:08:25.588 position:50% align:center
[SHIGARAKI]
Compress, wait!

00:08:25.672 --> 00:08:28.341 position:50% align:center
[MR. COMPRESS] No! I have
to seal this guy away!

00:08:30.552 --> 00:08:32.595 position:50% align:center
[MR. COMPRESS]
Why isn't my Quirk working?

00:08:32.679 --> 00:08:34.264 position:50% align:center
[CHISAKI]
Don't touch me!

00:08:35.348 --> 00:08:38.018 position:50% align:center
[MR. COMPRESS screams]

00:08:41.896 --> 00:08:42.939 position:50% align:center
[CHISAKI]
Shield!

00:08:52.824 --> 00:08:54.534 position:50% align:center
[SHIGARAKI]
Now I get it.

00:08:56.953 --> 00:08:59.039 position:50% align:center
[SHIGARAKI] You should have
just started with this.

00:08:59.122 --> 00:09:00.623 position:50% align:center
Saved us all some time.

00:09:00.707 --> 00:09:03.877 position:50% align:center
[KURONO]
That was a close one, Overhaul.

00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:05.462 position:50% align:center
[CHISAKI]
You're late.

00:09:05.545 --> 00:09:09.174 position:50% align:center
[KURONO] And I missed a shot.
But at least we know they work.

00:09:09.257 --> 00:09:10.675 position:50% align:center
[TWICE]
Where'd they come from!

00:09:10.759 --> 00:09:12.635 position:50% align:center
We weren't followed, I swear.

00:09:12.719 --> 00:09:15.472 position:50% align:center
[SHIGARAKI] One of them probably
has a tracking Quirk.

00:09:15.555 --> 00:09:18.099 position:50% align:center
[CHISAKI] Hard to be
objective in this situation.

00:09:18.183 --> 00:09:22.479 position:50% align:center
Besides, killing each
other isn't productive.

00:09:22.562 --> 00:09:25.982 position:50% align:center
[CHISAKI] A death on both sides.
Let's take a breather.

00:09:26.066 --> 00:09:28.777 position:50% align:center
We'll cool our heads
and try again later.

00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:30.737 position:50% align:center
I owe your side an arm.

00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:32.447 position:50% align:center
[TWICE]
Bastard! I'll eviscerate you.

00:09:32.530 --> 00:09:36.284 position:50% align:center
Tomura. Lemme cut
him. Real quick.

00:09:36.368 --> 00:09:37.494 position:50% align:center
[SHIGARAKI]
No.

00:09:37.577 --> 00:09:39.496 position:50% align:center
[TWICE]
It's my responsibility!

00:09:39.579 --> 00:09:40.580 position:50% align:center
[SHIGARAKI]
No.

00:09:40.663 --> 00:09:43.208 position:50% align:center
[MIMIC]
Smart decision, Face Palm guy.

00:09:43.291 --> 00:09:44.542 position:50% align:center
[CHISAKI]
I don't wanna rush you,

00:09:44.626 --> 00:09:47.462 position:50% align:center
but the sooner
we talk the better.

00:09:47.545 --> 00:09:49.589 position:50% align:center
Think things over carefully.

00:09:49.673 --> 00:09:52.801 position:50% align:center
Consider how your
organization should be run.

00:09:52.884 --> 00:09:55.345 position:50% align:center
Then, when you've
calmed down, call me.

00:09:55.428 --> 00:09:56.721 position:50% align:center
[TWICE]
They gotta pay for this!

00:09:56.805 --> 00:09:58.264 position:50% align:center
Why can't I go after him?

00:09:58.348 --> 00:09:59.265 position:50% align:center
[TOGA]
Think, Jin.

00:09:59.349 --> 00:10:01.851 position:50% align:center
We need to get
Atsuhiro to a doc.

00:10:01.935 --> 00:10:03.019 position:50% align:center
--[TWICE] Right.
--[MR. COMPRESS] My power

00:10:03.103 --> 00:10:05.647 position:50% align:center
wouldn't work.

00:10:05.730 --> 00:10:07.440 position:50% align:center
Damn, that hurts.

00:10:09.275 --> 00:10:11.695 position:50% align:center
[TOGA] Maybe we do have
time to make them bleed.

00:10:11.778 --> 00:10:13.738 position:50% align:center
[SHIGARAKI]
No.

00:10:13.822 --> 00:10:15.740 position:50% align:center
Come on, Tomura.

00:10:15.824 --> 00:10:17.367 position:50% align:center
[SHIGARAKI]
Another time.

00:10:18.785 --> 00:10:21.955 position:50% align:center
[ALL FOR ONE]
You failed again, didn't you?

00:10:22.038 --> 00:10:24.791 position:50% align:center
But do not be discouraged.

00:10:24.874 --> 00:10:27.252 position:50% align:center
Simply begin again.

00:10:27.335 --> 00:10:30.630 position:50% align:center
Start over as many
times as you need to.

00:10:30.714 --> 00:10:32.674 position:50% align:center
That's why I'm here.

00:10:32.757 --> 00:10:36.052 position:50% align:center
Everything is for you, Tomura.

00:10:36.136 --> 00:10:38.888 position:50% align:center
[CHISAKI] You need direction
to achieve your goals.

00:10:38.972 --> 00:10:41.182 position:50% align:center
And I have a plan.

00:10:41.266 --> 00:10:45.145 position:50% align:center
I didn't come here today
because I wanted to join you.

00:10:45.228 --> 00:10:47.731 position:50% align:center
[SHIGARAKI]
Shie Hassaikai.

00:10:47.814 --> 00:10:50.942 position:50% align:center
You'll pay for what
you've done today.

00:11:00.410 --> 00:11:02.495 position:50% align:center
[AIZAWA] The hero work
studies are a more serious

00:11:02.579 --> 00:11:04.372 position:50% align:center
version of your internships.

00:11:04.456 --> 00:11:06.499 position:50% align:center
They entail helping pro
agencies on the streets

00:11:06.583 --> 00:11:08.501 position:50% align:center
and with investigations.

00:11:08.585 --> 00:11:10.295 position:50% align:center
Your teachers and the
principal discussed them

00:11:10.378 --> 00:11:13.089 position:50% align:center
at the faculty meeting.
And we all agree.

00:11:13.173 --> 00:11:14.466 position:50% align:center
It's too soon.

00:11:14.549 --> 00:11:17.218 position:50% align:center
They should really be canceled.

00:11:17.302 --> 00:11:18.720 position:50% align:center
[STUDENTS]
What?!

00:11:18.803 --> 00:11:20.722 position:50% align:center
Aw, but we already
met about them!

00:11:20.805 --> 00:11:22.474 position:50% align:center
I guess, when you
think about why

00:11:22.557 --> 00:11:25.226 position:50% align:center
we had to move into the dorms,
it does make sense.

00:11:25.310 --> 00:11:26.686 position:50% align:center
Ha, ha!

00:11:26.770 --> 00:11:28.772 position:50% align:center
[HAGAKURE] Just because
you wouldn't get to do one.

00:11:28.855 --> 00:11:31.358 position:50% align:center
But... some people
think we won't be able

00:11:31.441 --> 00:11:34.569 position:50% align:center
to raise strong heroes with
that sort of protective outlook.

00:11:34.652 --> 00:11:36.863 position:50% align:center
And with that in mind,
the compromise

00:11:36.946 --> 00:11:39.824 position:50% align:center
is to be selective about
participating agencies.

00:11:39.908 --> 00:11:42.160 position:50% align:center
So, choose one with
a proven track record.

00:11:42.243 --> 00:11:44.829 position:50% align:center
Otherwise, you won't
be taking part.

00:11:46.581 --> 00:11:48.291 position:50% align:center
[TENYA]
A wise requirement.

00:11:48.375 --> 00:11:50.168 position:50% align:center
[TSUYU]
Maybe I should contact Selkie.

00:11:50.251 --> 00:11:51.753 position:50% align:center
Damn it!

00:11:51.836 --> 00:11:55.298 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] An agency with a good
track record of work studies.

00:11:55.382 --> 00:11:57.008 position:50% align:center
[GRAN TORINO] You know that
All Might can introduce you

00:11:57.092 --> 00:11:59.552 position:50% align:center
to a bunch of new people, right?

00:11:59.636 --> 00:12:02.222 position:50% align:center
First one who comes to mind
is his former sidekick.

00:12:02.305 --> 00:12:03.598 position:50% align:center
Wait, you want to
me to introduce you

00:12:03.682 --> 00:12:05.934 position:50% align:center
to Sir Nighteye for the
work study program?

00:12:06.017 --> 00:12:08.311 position:50% align:center
Yes! Since he's one of
the few heroes that've

00:12:08.395 --> 00:12:11.356 position:50% align:center
worked directly under
you, it's a perfect fit!

00:12:11.439 --> 00:12:13.274 position:50% align:center
[ALL MIGHT]
Sh.

00:12:13.358 --> 00:12:14.234 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Uh--

00:12:14.317 --> 00:12:15.318 position:50% align:center
[MIDNIGHT]
Someone's energetic

00:12:15.402 --> 00:12:16.986 position:50% align:center
[ECTOPLASM]
I wanna karaoke.

00:12:17.070 --> 00:12:19.239 position:50% align:center
So, Sir Nighteye.

00:12:19.322 --> 00:12:22.325 position:50% align:center
Who could have put that
idea into your head?

00:12:22.409 --> 00:12:24.160 position:50% align:center
No, of course.

00:12:24.244 --> 00:12:25.286 position:50% align:center
You wanted to be proactive,

00:12:25.370 --> 00:12:28.123 position:50% align:center
so you called Gran
Torino, didn't you?

00:12:28.206 --> 00:12:28.998 position:50% align:center
Yes, sir!

00:12:29.082 --> 00:12:31.001 position:50% align:center
Well, I refuse.

00:12:31.084 --> 00:12:33.461 position:50% align:center
I'm not saying that
to punish you, though.

00:12:33.545 --> 00:12:36.214 position:50% align:center
I have three reasons. First up.

00:12:36.297 --> 00:12:39.426 position:50% align:center
I opposed work studies in
a faculty meeting yesterday.

00:12:39.509 --> 00:12:41.302 position:50% align:center
I think it's unnecessary
for first years

00:12:41.386 --> 00:12:42.804 position:50% align:center
to start them so early.

00:12:42.887 --> 00:12:44.014 position:50% align:center
[THIRTEEN]
I agree.

00:12:44.097 --> 00:12:46.057 position:50% align:center
I say, we just support
any hungry students

00:12:46.141 --> 00:12:47.767 position:50% align:center
who want to go the extra mile.

00:12:47.851 --> 00:12:48.893 position:50% align:center
[ALL MIGHT]
Reason two.

00:12:48.977 --> 00:12:50.687 position:50% align:center
You need to work
on your Shoot Style.

00:12:50.770 --> 00:12:54.024 position:50% align:center
Let's master that before you
start doing extra hero work.

00:12:54.107 --> 00:12:55.775 position:50% align:center
[ECTOPLASM] He's putting in
a lot of training already.

00:12:55.859 --> 00:12:57.193 position:50% align:center
But there's still plenty of room

00:12:57.277 --> 00:13:00.155 position:50% align:center
for improvement before
he can use it reliably.

00:13:00.238 --> 00:13:02.574 position:50% align:center
[ALL MIGHT]
And third. Sir Nighteye...

00:13:02.657 --> 00:13:04.826 position:50% align:center
I just don't wanna
have to talk to the guy.

00:13:04.909 --> 00:13:07.287 position:50% align:center

Gimme a break.

00:13:12.292 --> 00:13:13.626 position:50% align:center
Ha!

00:13:13.710 --> 00:13:14.961 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
All Might.

00:13:16.338 --> 00:13:18.214 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] Kacchan told me
I'm not allowed to lose

00:13:18.298 --> 00:13:21.885 position:50% align:center
since someone like you laid
the groundwork for me.

00:13:21.968 --> 00:13:23.219 position:50% align:center
And think about it.

00:13:23.303 --> 00:13:25.555 position:50% align:center
My Quirk is so similar to yours.

00:13:25.638 --> 00:13:27.182 position:50% align:center
If I'm working for Nighteye,

00:13:27.265 --> 00:13:29.851 position:50% align:center
he'll know exactly how
to help me improve it.

00:13:29.934 --> 00:13:32.604 position:50% align:center
I need to get so much
stronger than I am now.

00:13:32.687 --> 00:13:35.315 position:50% align:center
I've got more work
to do than anyone.

00:13:35.398 --> 00:13:38.318 position:50% align:center
[ALL MIGHT] Is he that
impatient to succeed me?

00:13:38.401 --> 00:13:40.653 position:50% align:center
Probably not, but still.

00:13:40.737 --> 00:13:42.781 position:50% align:center
[ALL MIGHT]
Look, I appreciate your passion.

00:13:42.864 --> 00:13:45.658 position:50% align:center
But I can't introduce you.

00:13:45.742 --> 00:13:47.535 position:50% align:center
Emphasis on "I."

00:13:47.619 --> 00:13:49.412 position:50% align:center
Huh?

[PA VOICE 65A] Third-year

All Might would like
to speak with you.

00:13:53.458 --> 00:13:55.627 position:50% align:center
Please head to the

00:13:55.710 --> 00:13:56.878 position:50% align:center
I repeat.

Ha. Crazy. He wants
to talk to me?

00:13:59.881 --> 00:14:01.383 position:50% align:center
Wonder what it's about.

00:14:01.466 --> 00:14:03.927 position:50% align:center
Hey, Togata, hey.
What did you do?

00:14:04.010 --> 00:14:05.428 position:50% align:center
Are you in trouble or
something? What gives?

00:14:05.512 --> 00:14:07.639 position:50% align:center
[AMAJIKI] What business could
All Might have with you?

00:14:07.722 --> 00:14:11.726 position:50% align:center
[MIRIO] No clue. But...
I've to- <i>gata</i> go see!

00:14:11.810 --> 00:14:13.228 position:50% align:center
Get it?

00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:19.526 position:50% align:center
[MIRIO] Man! That was
supremely unfunny. Wasn't it?

00:14:19.609 --> 00:14:24.322 position:50% align:center
Aw, yeah. You are here!

00:14:24.406 --> 00:14:25.990 position:50% align:center
Sorry! Couldn't help myself.

I just got super excited
you wanted to talk to me.

00:14:28.743 --> 00:14:31.621 position:50% align:center
Um. I don't really understand
what's going on right now.

00:14:31.705 --> 00:14:34.874 position:50% align:center
Right? I'm completely
clueless, too!

00:14:34.958 --> 00:14:37.002 position:50% align:center
You've met Young Togata, right?

00:14:37.085 --> 00:14:40.880 position:50% align:center
He's currently doing his work
study at Nighteye's agency.

00:14:40.964 --> 00:14:43.258 position:50% align:center
Whoa, seriously? That's so cool!

00:14:43.341 --> 00:14:44.968 position:50% align:center
Yup! I've been
working alongside him

for a full year now!

00:14:46.261 --> 00:14:47.512 position:50% align:center
Then you're, like, guaranteed

00:14:47.595 --> 00:14:49.556 position:50% align:center
to be his sidekick

00:14:49.639 --> 00:14:51.975 position:50% align:center
Well, as long as Sir doesn't
change his mind, yeah.

00:14:52.058 --> 00:14:54.060 position:50% align:center
That's awesome!

00:14:54.144 --> 00:14:56.229 position:50% align:center
All right, I'm gonna get
straight to the point here.

00:14:56.312 --> 00:14:58.523 position:50% align:center
Tell me, Young Togata, do you
think that this first-year

00:14:58.606 --> 00:15:01.943 position:50% align:center

[MIRIO]
Oh, now I hear ya.

00:15:03.945 --> 00:15:06.573 position:50% align:center
That's what you called me
in here to talk about, huh?

00:15:06.656 --> 00:15:09.367 position:50% align:center
You want me to take Midoriya
to him for an introduction!

00:15:09.451 --> 00:15:10.785 position:50% align:center
[ALL MIGHT]
Yeah.

00:15:10.869 --> 00:15:12.495 position:50% align:center
But, wait a minute, why do
you need to go through me?

00:15:12.579 --> 00:15:14.122 position:50% align:center
I always see him
watching old video clips

00:15:14.205 --> 00:15:16.332 position:50% align:center
of you in his spare time.
I'm sure he'd be real happy

00:15:16.416 --> 00:15:18.168 position:50% align:center
if you called him up yourself.

00:15:18.251 --> 00:15:20.920 position:50% align:center
[ALL MIGHT] I can't exactly
face him right now.

00:15:21.004 --> 00:15:22.422 position:50% align:center
Because he was dead right.

00:15:22.505 --> 00:15:25.508 position:50% align:center
I ended up precisely where
he warned me I'd be.

00:15:25.592 --> 00:15:27.010 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:15:27.093 --> 00:15:30.305 position:50% align:center
So... do you think Young

00:15:30.388 --> 00:15:32.515 position:50% align:center
Oh, man, that's a toughie.

00:15:33.975 --> 00:15:37.312 position:50% align:center
[MIRIO] Why don't you tell me
what kinda hero you wanna be?

00:15:37.395 --> 00:15:38.980 position:50% align:center
What kind?

00:15:39.064 --> 00:15:40.774 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] There's always

00:15:40.857 --> 00:15:43.276 position:50% align:center
no matter how bad things get.

00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:46.821 position:50% align:center
Even when everything
looks impossible.

00:15:46.905 --> 00:15:52.035 position:50% align:center
Do you think I can
be a hero, too?

00:15:52.118 --> 00:15:55.288 position:50% align:center

Izuku! I can't do this anymore.

00:16:06.132 --> 00:16:09.302 position:50% align:center
I want to be strong
so I won't worry people.

00:16:09.386 --> 00:16:12.681 position:50% align:center
I want to always win
and save everybody.

00:16:14.599 --> 00:16:17.811 position:50% align:center
I want to become
the greatest. Got it?

00:16:18.937 --> 00:16:20.563 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] Sometimes
it's easier to organize

00:16:20.647 --> 00:16:22.649 position:50% align:center
your thoughts out loud.

00:16:22.732 --> 00:16:24.818 position:50% align:center
I've been through
some intense times.

00:16:24.901 --> 00:16:27.278 position:50% align:center
The more I experience,
the more I see how hard it is

00:16:27.362 --> 00:16:30.824 position:50% align:center
to be the kind of hero
I want to be.

00:16:30.907 --> 00:16:34.077 position:50% align:center
That's why I have
to become stronger.

00:16:40.542 --> 00:16:43.336 position:50% align:center
[MIRIO]
Wow, that was a lot.

00:16:44.838 --> 00:16:47.549 position:50% align:center
[MIRIO chuckles] There's no
reason for me to say no, though.

00:16:47.632 --> 00:16:49.050 position:50% align:center
So yeah!

00:16:49.134 --> 00:16:52.637 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU gasps] You mean it?
Oh, wow, thank you so, so much!

00:16:52.721 --> 00:16:55.557 position:50% align:center
Sure! I always figured Sir would
take a liking to you anyway.

00:16:55.640 --> 00:16:58.393 position:50% align:center
I sure hope he does!

00:16:58.476 --> 00:16:59.602 position:50% align:center
[MIRIO]
Don't get too psyched.

00:16:59.686 --> 00:17:01.229 position:50% align:center
I dunno if Sir will
agree to take you on.

00:17:01.312 --> 00:17:02.897 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] Of course, but still,
I'm very grateful.

00:17:02.981 --> 00:17:04.858 position:50% align:center
[NEZU] I have no doubt
that someone worthy

00:17:04.941 --> 00:17:07.902 position:50% align:center
of your power walks the
halls of our fine school.

00:17:07.986 --> 00:17:10.905 position:50% align:center
Mirio Togata, huh?
And who is that?

00:17:10.989 --> 00:17:13.074 position:50% align:center
[NEZU] Well, his grades
aren't anything special,

00:17:13.158 --> 00:17:15.910 position:50% align:center
but he certainly has
a lively presence.

00:17:15.994 --> 00:17:17.412 position:50% align:center
There's near-constant laughter

00:17:17.495 --> 00:17:20.206 position:50% align:center
in the halls whenever
he's around.

00:17:20.290 --> 00:17:24.002 position:50% align:center
And even if he fails a test,
his smile never disappears.

00:17:24.085 --> 00:17:28.923 position:50% align:center
Doesn't it sound like he aligns
with your philosophies?

00:17:29.007 --> 00:17:31.926 position:50% align:center
[ALL MIGHT]
This kid. If I hadn't met

00:17:32.010 --> 00:17:34.387 position:50% align:center
Young Midoriya when I did...

00:17:37.515 --> 00:17:39.851 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Before long, it was the weekend.

00:17:41.770 --> 00:17:43.646 position:50% align:center
A whole day off, huh?

00:17:43.730 --> 00:17:46.232 position:50% align:center
[MINETA] Yeah, after all the
exams and special training,

00:17:46.316 --> 00:17:47.942 position:50% align:center
we can finally take
it easy for once.

00:17:48.026 --> 00:17:50.153 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Morning!

00:17:50.236 --> 00:17:52.655 position:50% align:center
Okay, what's up with him?

00:17:52.739 --> 00:17:54.074 position:50% align:center
Oh, hey, lookie there.

00:17:54.157 --> 00:17:56.910 position:50% align:center
They've got provisional license
training on weekends.

00:17:56.993 --> 00:17:58.995 position:50% align:center
You should be thankful
to the teachers.

00:17:59.079 --> 00:18:01.289 position:50% align:center
You got caught fighting
with Midoriya.

00:18:01.373 --> 00:18:03.958 position:50% align:center
But they're still going
to let you retake the exam.

00:18:04.042 --> 00:18:05.835 position:50% align:center
Oh, will you shut it?

00:18:05.919 --> 00:18:07.879 position:50% align:center
We've got to catch up
to our classmates soon.

00:18:07.962 --> 00:18:10.090 position:50% align:center
I told you to shut
your damn face!

00:18:10.173 --> 00:18:12.300 position:50% align:center
And walk behind me, idiot!

00:18:14.135 --> 00:18:17.055 position:50% align:center
We're having a study session
with Yaoyorozu later.

00:18:17.138 --> 00:18:18.807 position:50% align:center
You guys wanna come along?

00:18:18.890 --> 00:18:21.434 position:50% align:center
[KIRISHIMA]
Sorry, man. We're busy today.

00:18:21.518 --> 00:18:24.187 position:50% align:center
I'll be studying some websites.

00:18:24.270 --> 00:18:27.357 position:50% align:center
To each their own,
I guess. Have fun.

00:18:29.401 --> 00:18:31.945 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
An hour by train from UA.

00:18:32.028 --> 00:18:34.280 position:50% align:center
Well, this is it,
Sir Nighteye's agency.

00:18:34.364 --> 00:18:35.448 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU grunts]

00:18:35.532 --> 00:18:38.410 position:50% align:center
Easy man. Take a breath.
Try to loosen up!

00:18:38.493 --> 00:18:39.744 position:50% align:center
But not too loose, ya know.

00:18:39.828 --> 00:18:42.122 position:50% align:center
'Cause, uh, Sir's actually
a pretty strict guy.

00:18:42.205 --> 00:18:43.540 position:50% align:center
I'm fully aware!

00:18:43.623 --> 00:18:45.542 position:50% align:center
He's a hero famous
for being demanding,

00:18:45.625 --> 00:18:47.544 position:50% align:center
on others as well as himself.

00:18:47.627 --> 00:18:49.671 position:50% align:center
His gaze is so harsh
that it makes me shiver

00:18:49.754 --> 00:18:51.631 position:50% align:center
every time I see him on TV.

00:18:51.715 --> 00:18:53.591 position:50% align:center
He looks so severe!

00:18:53.675 --> 00:18:55.385 position:50% align:center
That's absolutely true.

00:18:55.468 --> 00:18:56.970 position:50% align:center
But there's a totally
different side of him

00:18:57.053 --> 00:18:59.764 position:50% align:center
that the press
never gets to see.

00:18:59.848 --> 00:19:02.225 position:50% align:center
If you wanna be acknowledged
by him, here's a tip.

00:19:02.308 --> 00:19:05.437 position:50% align:center
You need to do one important
thing at this meeting.

00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:06.688 position:50% align:center
Y'gotta make him laugh.

00:19:06.771 --> 00:19:09.441 position:50% align:center
Then he'll totally
approve of you.

00:19:09.524 --> 00:19:10.650 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Huh?

00:19:10.734 --> 00:19:13.028 position:50% align:center
W-Wait. Hold on.
What does that mean?

00:19:13.111 --> 00:19:14.362 position:50% align:center
Exactly what it sounds like.

00:19:14.446 --> 00:19:16.156 position:50% align:center
He seems stern,
but he really values

00:19:16.239 --> 00:19:17.282 position:50% align:center
humor for some reason.

00:19:17.365 --> 00:19:19.993 position:50% align:center
It's, like, irony or
something I think.

00:19:20.076 --> 00:19:21.870 position:50% align:center
The most I can do is
introduce you to him.

00:19:21.953 --> 00:19:24.164 position:50% align:center
Sir's the one who'll decide
if he can use you.

00:19:24.247 --> 00:19:26.291 position:50% align:center
I wish I could help more,
but that's all I got.

00:19:26.374 --> 00:19:27.709 position:50% align:center
From here on, you'll
have to figure out

00:19:27.792 --> 00:19:30.295 position:50% align:center
how to make Sir
acknowledge you yourself.

00:19:30.378 --> 00:19:31.755 position:50% align:center
I've been meaning to ask.

00:19:31.838 --> 00:19:33.798 position:50% align:center
Why is it you seem to
know so much about me

00:19:33.882 --> 00:19:35.884 position:50% align:center
even though we
basically just met?

00:19:35.967 --> 00:19:36.885 position:50% align:center
[MIRIO]
What are ya talkin' about?

00:19:36.968 --> 00:19:38.386 position:50% align:center
I don't know you at all!

00:19:38.470 --> 00:19:40.764 position:50% align:center
But I do know that you've
got a crazy-ambitious goal

00:19:40.847 --> 00:19:42.932 position:50% align:center
and you're fighting to
turn it into a reality.

00:19:43.016 --> 00:19:44.809 position:50% align:center
And wanting to help out
someone who's in trouble

00:19:44.893 --> 00:19:47.645 position:50% align:center
is basically
Hero-ing 101, amiright?

00:19:50.815 --> 00:19:54.861 position:50% align:center
Here we are! He's just
beyond this door.

00:19:54.944 --> 00:19:58.448 position:50% align:center
If you wanna get stronger,
then walk on through!

00:19:58.531 --> 00:19:59.532 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Got it!

00:20:00.867 --> 00:20:02.118 position:50% align:center
Let's see.

00:20:02.202 --> 00:20:04.329 position:50% align:center
The meeting site was already
deserted by the time

00:20:04.412 --> 00:20:06.664 position:50% align:center
we got there, but we did
find evidence that blood

00:20:06.748 --> 00:20:07.999 position:50% align:center
had been wiped off the floor.

00:20:08.083 --> 00:20:09.542 position:50% align:center
Due to the massive
amount of damage

00:20:09.626 --> 00:20:11.628 position:50% align:center
to the building itself,
it's safe to presume

00:20:11.711 --> 00:20:13.463 position:50% align:center
that some sort of fight
went down there.

00:20:13.546 --> 00:20:15.256 position:50% align:center
It's most likely the
League of Villains,

00:20:15.340 --> 00:20:17.050 position:50% align:center
--but we're not positive.
--[SIR NIGHTEYE] That's enough.

00:20:17.133 --> 00:20:18.218 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:20:18.301 --> 00:20:20.512 position:50% align:center
You know, there's no
future for a society

00:20:20.595 --> 00:20:22.889 position:50% align:center
without both humor and energy.

00:20:22.972 --> 00:20:24.641 position:50% align:center
[BUBBLE GIRL]
Huh? Um, Sir.

00:20:24.724 --> 00:20:26.810 position:50% align:center
The report is really long, so...

00:20:26.893 --> 00:20:29.646 position:50% align:center
I was just trying
not to mess up.

00:20:29.729 --> 00:20:33.191 position:50% align:center
Wait. No. Oh, please don't!

00:20:34.734 --> 00:20:36.569 position:50% align:center
Heyo, I brought
that first-year dude

00:20:36.653 --> 00:20:38.113 position:50% align:center
I mentioned yesterday.

00:20:38.196 --> 00:20:39.531 position:50% align:center
Sir Nighteye's Agency.

00:20:39.614 --> 00:20:41.324 position:50% align:center
Let's see what kind
of place this is.

00:20:41.408 --> 00:20:43.660 position:50% align:center
[BUBBLE GIRL laughing]

00:20:46.121 --> 00:20:47.706 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
What kind of place is this?

00:20:47.789 --> 00:20:51.126 position:50% align:center
[SIR NIGHTEYE] See, this is how
loud and energetic you can be.

00:20:51.209 --> 00:20:53.503 position:50% align:center
Stop! Please!

00:20:53.586 --> 00:20:55.755 position:50% align:center
Mirio, what's going on?

00:20:55.839 --> 00:20:58.049 position:50% align:center
That's his sidekick.
Bubble Girl.

00:20:58.133 --> 00:21:00.927 position:50% align:center
I guess she didn't make
him laugh. Oh, sucks.

00:21:03.847 --> 00:21:05.557 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
So this is Sir Nighteye!

00:21:05.640 --> 00:21:07.392 position:50% align:center
All Might's former sidekick.

00:21:07.475 --> 00:21:10.562 position:50% align:center
Oh, crap, his stare's just
as intense in person!

00:21:10.645 --> 00:21:11.980 position:50% align:center
[MIRIO] If you wanna be
acknowledged by him,

00:21:12.063 --> 00:21:14.357 position:50% align:center
here's a tip.

00:21:14.441 --> 00:21:16.151 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
I have to become stronger.

00:21:16.234 --> 00:21:18.361 position:50% align:center
Others helped me to get
to where I am today.

00:21:18.445 --> 00:21:22.240 position:50% align:center
But from this moment on,
I need to open the doors myself.

00:21:22.323 --> 00:21:25.994 position:50% align:center
He wants to laugh?
I can do that.

00:21:26.995 --> 00:21:29.247 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] In order to become
the number-one hero!

00:21:29.330 --> 00:21:31.166 position:50% align:center
I'm Izuku Midoriya.

00:21:31.249 --> 00:21:32.751 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:21:32.834 --> 00:21:35.462 position:50% align:center
[BUBBLE GIRL laughing]

00:21:35.545 --> 00:21:37.589 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] I admired All Might
so much that I practiced

00:21:37.672 --> 00:21:40.550 position:50% align:center
my impression of him
in the mirror for years!

00:21:40.633 --> 00:21:43.053 position:50% align:center
I'm not especially good
at making people laugh.

00:21:43.136 --> 00:21:47.307 position:50% align:center
So if this doesn't work,
I'm done for!

00:21:47.390 --> 00:21:49.392 position:50% align:center
What is this, boy?

00:21:49.476 --> 00:21:51.853 position:50% align:center
Are you ridiculing All Might?

00:21:54.105 --> 00:21:57.692 position:50% align:center
[MIRIO]
No! He's not funny!

00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:30.910 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Here's the preview!

00:23:30.994 --> 00:23:32.954 position:50% align:center
Thanks to third-year
Mirio Togata,

00:23:33.038 --> 00:23:35.790 position:50% align:center
I find myself at the
agency of Sir Nighteye,

00:23:35.874 --> 00:23:37.959 position:50% align:center
All Might's former sidekick.

00:23:38.043 --> 00:23:40.295 position:50% align:center
I don't exactly make
a good first impression,

00:23:40.378 --> 00:23:41.838 position:50% align:center
but I'm not about to give up!

00:23:41.921 --> 00:23:44.299 position:50% align:center
If I can just do my work
study at this agency,

00:23:44.382 --> 00:23:46.217 position:50% align:center
I know I'll learn so much
about what it takes

00:23:46.301 --> 00:23:49.137 position:50% align:center
to be a real hero.
Wait, there's a test?

00:23:49.220 --> 00:23:50.889 position:50% align:center
But I'm totally unprepared!

00:23:50.972 --> 00:23:53.266 position:50% align:center
Next time: "Boy Meets..."

00:23:53.350 --> 00:23:54.976 position:50% align:center
Was this introduction fate?

00:23:55.060 --> 00:23:57.354 position:50% align:center
Go beyond! Plus Ultra!
