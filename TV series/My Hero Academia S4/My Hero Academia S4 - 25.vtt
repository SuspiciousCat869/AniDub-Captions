00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.721 position:50% align:center
[FUYUMI] I brought clean clothes
and something to keep you warm.

00:00:12.804 --> 00:00:14.305 position:50% align:center
[REI]
Thanks.

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:16.391 position:50% align:center
It's supposed to get
kinda chilly next week.

00:00:16.474 --> 00:00:17.600 position:50% align:center
[REI]
That sounds nice.

00:00:17.684 --> 00:00:18.685 position:50% align:center
[FUYUMI chuckles]

00:00:18.768 --> 00:00:20.186 position:50% align:center
[REI]
I like the cold.

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:23.106 position:50% align:center
The heat's never
been our thing, huh?

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.233 position:50% align:center
I'm glad to see
you're looking healthy.

00:00:25.316 --> 00:00:28.278 position:50% align:center
Ever since he started college,
we stopped seeing him as much.

00:00:28.361 --> 00:00:30.113 position:50% align:center
I'm pretty sure he's got
a new girl there.

00:00:30.196 --> 00:00:31.114 position:50% align:center
Oh, come on, Sis!

00:00:31.197 --> 00:00:33.199 position:50% align:center
That's not fair,
I call you guys!

00:00:33.283 --> 00:00:34.868 position:50% align:center
Anyway, you look
great, too, Mom!

00:00:34.951 --> 00:00:36.786 position:50% align:center
I'm happy to see
a smile on your face!

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.955 position:50% align:center
Any special reason?

00:00:39.039 --> 00:00:41.624 position:50% align:center
Well, Shoto has been
sending me letters.

00:00:41.708 --> 00:00:43.877 position:50% align:center
He said the extra training
for the provisional license

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:47.630 position:50% align:center
is tough, but he's working hard
to catch up to his friends.

00:00:47.714 --> 00:00:50.467 position:50% align:center
Wow. Didn't know
he wrote you so much.

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.344 position:50% align:center
[FUYUMI] Between living at
the dorms and his training,

00:00:52.427 --> 00:00:54.554 position:50% align:center
he hasn't been able
to pop by nearly as much.

00:00:54.637 --> 00:00:56.848 position:50% align:center
Hey. Don't you think it's time
they let you get a phone?

00:00:56.931 --> 00:00:59.017 position:50% align:center
It'd be easier than writing.

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.435 position:50% align:center
You're right.

00:01:00.518 --> 00:01:02.354 position:50% align:center
I'll see what the doctors say.

00:01:02.437 --> 00:01:03.605 position:50% align:center
[FUYUMI]
Can I see the letters?

00:01:03.688 --> 00:01:07.233 position:50% align:center
[REI]
Sure. Just don't tell Shoto.

00:01:07.317 --> 00:01:08.318 position:50% align:center
[NATSUO]
By the way...

00:01:08.401 --> 00:01:09.652 position:50% align:center
[REI]
Hm?

00:01:09.736 --> 00:01:12.697 position:50% align:center
D'ya see? <i>He's</i> officially
number one now.

00:01:12.781 --> 00:01:14.282 position:50% align:center
Natsu.

00:01:14.366 --> 00:01:17.494 position:50% align:center
[NATSUO] The world doesn't know
what he did to you or to us.

00:01:17.577 --> 00:01:20.330 position:50% align:center
How terribly he
treated his family.

00:01:20.413 --> 00:01:22.916 position:50% align:center
It's not like he ever
mentions us or anything.

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:24.876 position:50% align:center
[FUYUMI] Come on, why would
you even bring him up?

00:01:24.959 --> 00:01:27.212 position:50% align:center
It's fine, Fuyumi.

00:01:27.295 --> 00:01:29.631 position:50% align:center
[NATSUO] I barely
remember him being around.

00:01:29.714 --> 00:01:31.174 position:50% align:center
He's basically like
a stranger to me,

00:01:31.257 --> 00:01:34.010 position:50% align:center
so I don't care
what happens to him.

00:01:34.094 --> 00:01:36.262 position:50% align:center
Still... I can't stand
that he pretends

00:01:36.346 --> 00:01:38.515 position:50% align:center
he never did anything
bad to you guys.

00:01:38.598 --> 00:01:40.767 position:50% align:center
Especially to you, Mom.

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:43.436 position:50% align:center
It's been about ten years
since he put you in here.

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:45.897 position:50% align:center
And he hasn't had
the decency to apologize.

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:47.273 position:50% align:center
He wants to leave
the past behind

00:01:47.357 --> 00:01:50.402 position:50% align:center
and forget about his family.

00:01:50.485 --> 00:01:53.530 position:50% align:center
I don't think that's true.

00:01:53.613 --> 00:01:56.866 position:50% align:center
Why do you always insist
on protecting him, Mom?

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:58.576 position:50% align:center
[REI]
See those flowers?

00:02:00.412 --> 00:02:02.288 position:50% align:center
[REI]
He knows they're my favorite.

00:02:04.457 --> 00:02:05.917 position:50% align:center
I only mentioned it once.

00:02:06.001 --> 00:02:07.544 position:50% align:center
When we'd just met.

00:02:07.627 --> 00:02:09.337 position:50% align:center
[FUYUMI]
Wait, Dad's been here?

00:02:09.421 --> 00:02:11.923 position:50% align:center
Many times, apparently.

00:02:12.007 --> 00:02:14.676 position:50% align:center
Of course, I haven't seen him.

00:02:14.759 --> 00:02:16.219 position:50% align:center
I'm still afraid.

00:02:16.302 --> 00:02:19.764 position:50% align:center
And the doctors don't
think it's a wise idea.

00:02:19.848 --> 00:02:23.226 position:50% align:center
I have no idea what he's
feeling or how his mind works.

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:26.813 position:50% align:center
Nor the external pressures
that must be on him.

00:02:26.896 --> 00:02:29.941 position:50% align:center
But see? He is
thinking about us.

00:02:31.317 --> 00:02:35.321 position:50% align:center
[REI] He's definitely trying
to face his past and his family.

00:02:35.405 --> 00:02:37.157 position:50% align:center
In his own way.

00:04:12.002 --> 00:04:14.212 position:50% align:center
[HAWKS] Hey, Endeavor,
I didn't know you could fly.

00:04:14.295 --> 00:04:15.588 position:50% align:center
I'm just not falling!

00:04:15.672 --> 00:04:16.881 position:50% align:center
Now stay alert.

00:04:16.965 --> 00:04:19.009 position:50% align:center
This thing's still moving.

00:04:19.092 --> 00:04:27.267 position:50% align:center
[HIGH-END] Ha, didn't think you
could kill me with puny flames,

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:30.812 position:50% align:center
did you, Hero?

00:04:31.813 --> 00:04:33.898 position:50% align:center
[ENDEAVOR]
He's regenerating.

00:04:33.982 --> 00:04:37.652 position:50% align:center
The one at Hosu
could do that, too.

00:04:37.736 --> 00:04:39.237 position:50% align:center
I've never seen
one of the grey ones

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:40.780 position:50% align:center
with that power.

00:04:41.865 --> 00:04:45.452 position:50% align:center
[ENDEAVOR] Does that mean the
black Nomu have more abilities?

00:04:45.535 --> 00:04:47.954 position:50% align:center
No, it's not just that.

00:04:48.038 --> 00:04:51.082 position:50% align:center
This one is completely
unlike any other I've faced.

00:04:51.166 --> 00:04:52.375 position:50% align:center
Because...

00:04:52.459 --> 00:04:53.752 position:50% align:center
...it can talk!

00:04:53.835 --> 00:04:55.712 position:50% align:center
Show me strength.

00:04:55.795 --> 00:04:57.422 position:50% align:center
[ENDEAVOR]
In that case,

00:04:57.505 --> 00:04:59.716 position:50% align:center
I'll take it alive
for interrogation!

00:05:02.385 --> 00:05:04.721 position:50% align:center
[ENDEAVOR]
Flashfire Fist.

00:05:04.804 --> 00:05:06.473 position:50% align:center

00:05:25.408 --> 00:05:26.576 position:50% align:center
[ENDEAVOR growls]

00:05:29.079 --> 00:05:30.997 position:50% align:center
[ENDEAVOR] He's already
on the attack again?

00:05:32.248 --> 00:05:34.125 position:50% align:center
[HIGH-END roars]

00:05:34.751 --> 00:05:37.420 position:50% align:center
[screaming]

00:05:37.504 --> 00:05:40.632 position:50% align:center
[HAWKS] Come on.
Get yourself together now.

00:05:40.715 --> 00:05:42.300 position:50% align:center
Stop 'im, Number One!

00:05:52.018 --> 00:05:54.354 position:50% align:center
[ENDEAVOR]
It overcame my reverse thrust.

00:05:55.897 --> 00:05:58.775 position:50% align:center
[ENDEAVOR] How is this thing
faster and stronger than me?

00:06:00.735 --> 00:06:02.153 position:50% align:center
You've gotta be kidding me!

00:06:02.237 --> 00:06:03.279 position:50% align:center
It's falling!

00:06:09.202 --> 00:06:10.578 position:50% align:center
[HAWKS]
Sense them. Fierce Wings.

00:06:11.955 --> 00:06:15.166 position:50% align:center
[HAWKS] Screams,
breaths, rustling clothes,

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:18.086 position:50% align:center
every human movement.

00:06:18.169 --> 00:06:20.964 position:50% align:center
I won't be able to get
everyone out of the building.

00:06:23.299 --> 00:06:25.051 position:50% align:center
[HAWKS]
I don't have enough feathers.

00:06:25.135 --> 00:06:27.762 position:50% align:center
So, I'll focus on those
in the most danger.

00:06:29.139 --> 00:06:31.808 position:50% align:center
[PRESENT MIC]
Hawks. Quirk: Fierce Wings!

00:06:31.891 --> 00:06:34.060 position:50% align:center
He has tough,
yet supple feathers!

00:06:34.144 --> 00:06:36.896 position:50% align:center
Each and every one of them
is under his control.

00:06:40.984 --> 00:06:43.820 position:50% align:center
[HAWKS] Seventy-six people
in the damaged section,

00:06:43.903 --> 00:06:46.072 position:50% align:center
all evacuated safely!

00:06:51.619 --> 00:06:52.954 position:50% align:center
[ENDEAVOR]
Flashfire Fist.

00:06:54.497 --> 00:06:56.541 position:50% align:center
Hell Spider!

00:07:01.129 --> 00:07:02.964 position:50% align:center
Is that the best
you've got, tough guy?

00:07:03.048 --> 00:07:04.674 position:50% align:center
Of course not!

00:07:04.758 --> 00:07:06.760 position:50% align:center
[ENDEAVOR]
Time to slice and burn.

00:07:14.768 --> 00:07:16.394 position:50% align:center
[HAWKS grunts]

00:07:16.478 --> 00:07:18.021 position:50% align:center
I'm guessing you don't
spend a whole lot of time

00:07:18.104 --> 00:07:20.190 position:50% align:center
in the kitchen,
do you, Endeavor?

00:07:20.273 --> 00:07:22.400 position:50% align:center
That's bad form, your food's
supposed to be chopped

00:07:22.484 --> 00:07:24.319 position:50% align:center
into uniform pieces.

00:07:24.402 --> 00:07:26.905 position:50% align:center
[ENDEAVOR] You should stop
yapping and get back in the air.

00:07:26.988 --> 00:07:28.198 position:50% align:center
Love to.

00:07:28.281 --> 00:07:30.033 position:50% align:center
But when I lose feathers,
it makes it way harder

00:07:30.116 --> 00:07:31.242 position:50% align:center
for me to fly.

00:07:31.326 --> 00:07:33.161 position:50% align:center
[ENDEAVOR]
Just deal with it.

00:07:33.244 --> 00:07:34.621 position:50% align:center
[HIGH-END]
Bird...

00:07:35.372 --> 00:07:36.748 position:50% align:center
You guys. Don't worry.

00:07:36.831 --> 00:07:37.957 position:50% align:center
We got you!

00:07:41.169 --> 00:07:42.879 position:50% align:center
[HIGH-END]
You're in the way!

00:07:45.090 --> 00:07:47.342 position:50% align:center
[NOMU 88A roars]

00:07:47.425 --> 00:07:50.553 position:50% align:center
[ENDEAVOR] More of them? They're
not the same color, though.

00:07:50.637 --> 00:07:53.181 position:50% align:center
Were they just stored
inside its body?

00:07:53.264 --> 00:07:54.349 position:50% align:center
[ENDEAVOR growls]

00:07:54.432 --> 00:07:56.476 position:50% align:center
I'm starting to overheat...

00:07:59.145 --> 00:08:02.232 position:50% align:center
[HIGH-END]
Which of you is strongest?

00:08:02.315 --> 00:08:04.401 position:50% align:center
[ENDEAVOR] If that's why
it showed up here today,

00:08:04.484 --> 00:08:08.029 position:50% align:center
it has no interest in
fighting someone weak.

00:08:08.113 --> 00:08:10.615 position:50% align:center
That sounds about
right for a villain.

00:08:10.699 --> 00:08:12.867 position:50% align:center
And in order to
keep focusing on me,

00:08:12.951 --> 00:08:17.080 position:50% align:center
it's using pawns to keep
my backup occupied.

00:08:17.163 --> 00:08:20.834 position:50% align:center
This Nomu is thinking.

00:08:20.917 --> 00:08:23.586 position:50% align:center
Oh, god! Somebody, help us!

00:08:25.755 --> 00:08:28.174 position:50% align:center
--[HAWKS yells]
--[NOMU 88B, 88D groan]

00:08:29.592 --> 00:08:31.011 position:50% align:center
Hawks! Thank you!

00:08:31.094 --> 00:08:32.262 position:50% align:center
Whoa!

00:08:32.345 --> 00:08:35.557 position:50% align:center
[HAWKS] I gotcha. Let's
get you somewhere safe.

00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:41.521 position:50% align:center
Although, to be frank, I'm not
great against power types.

00:08:41.604 --> 00:08:44.024 position:50% align:center
So I'm not making
any guarantees.

00:08:46.067 --> 00:08:48.153 position:50% align:center
[HIGH-END]
You aren't firing.

00:08:48.236 --> 00:08:49.404 position:50% align:center
Why?

00:08:49.487 --> 00:08:53.491 position:50% align:center
The heat rays... stopped.

00:08:53.575 --> 00:08:58.038 position:50% align:center
Or are you just
running out of power?

00:08:58.997 --> 00:09:01.249 position:50% align:center
[ENDEAVOR]
It's perceptive, too.

00:09:01.332 --> 00:09:04.711 position:50% align:center
Flashfire Fist compresses and
intensifies my flames into

00:09:04.794 --> 00:09:07.547 position:50% align:center
a single super-hot blow.

00:09:07.630 --> 00:09:09.215 position:50% align:center
If I use it recklessly,

00:09:09.299 --> 00:09:13.178 position:50% align:center
my temperature rises, and my
body starts to deteriorate.

00:09:13.261 --> 00:09:14.554 position:50% align:center
But right now,

00:09:14.637 --> 00:09:17.432 position:50% align:center
not only is this monster
faster and stronger than me,

00:09:17.515 --> 00:09:20.060 position:50% align:center
I have no idea what
other Quirks it may have.

00:09:20.143 --> 00:09:22.312 position:50% align:center
Holding back could
prove to be fatal.

00:09:23.730 --> 00:09:27.067 position:50% align:center
[ENDEAVOR] Overheating has
always been a problem.

00:09:28.693 --> 00:09:30.278 position:50% align:center
[ENDEAVOR]
It's what drove me.

00:09:31.821 --> 00:09:33.490 position:50% align:center
[ENDEAVOR]
With each of you.

00:09:35.825 --> 00:09:38.453 position:50% align:center
[ENDEAVOR]
The reason for my actions.

00:09:40.663 --> 00:09:42.791 position:50% align:center
[ENDEAVOR growls]

00:09:42.874 --> 00:09:46.127 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Look at that,
Endeavor is still in the sky!

00:09:46.211 --> 00:09:47.587 position:50% align:center
Shining brightly.

00:09:47.671 --> 00:09:50.006 position:50% align:center
