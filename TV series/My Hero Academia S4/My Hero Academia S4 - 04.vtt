--Y'know?
--[BYSTANDER 67A gasps]

00:00:10.135 --> 00:00:11.594 position:50% align:center
Hey, look! Heroes!

00:00:11.678 --> 00:00:13.555 position:50% align:center
[BYSTANDER 67B] That's the guy
from the UA sports festival!

00:00:13.638 --> 00:00:15.557 position:50% align:center
This is sorta nerve-wracking.

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:16.891 position:50% align:center
What gives? You
went out on patrol

00:00:16.975 --> 00:00:18.268 position:50% align:center
during your internship,
didn't you?

00:00:18.351 --> 00:00:19.394 position:50% align:center
Though, I guess
I don't blame you

00:00:19.477 --> 00:00:21.146 position:50% align:center
for being shaken
after what went down.

00:00:21.229 --> 00:00:22.772 position:50% align:center
Oh, no. It's not that.

00:00:22.856 --> 00:00:24.190 position:50% align:center
I just kinda missed
out on learning

00:00:24.274 --> 00:00:25.442 position:50% align:center
some of the basics, so...

00:00:25.525 --> 00:00:27.318 position:50% align:center
Yeah? Huh, that must be strange.

00:00:27.402 --> 00:00:28.570 position:50% align:center
Ah, don't you worry.

00:00:28.653 --> 00:00:30.321 position:50% align:center
Sir and Bubble are the
ones who are actually

00:00:30.405 --> 00:00:32.073 position:50% align:center
watching the target today,
so I can teach you

00:00:32.157 --> 00:00:33.408 position:50% align:center
all about patrol duty.

00:00:33.491 --> 00:00:35.035 position:50% align:center
We'll get you up to snuff!

00:00:35.118 --> 00:00:38.079 position:50% align:center
Just watch and learn, my friend!

00:00:38.163 --> 00:00:39.581 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
I still don't get it.

00:00:39.664 --> 00:00:43.293 position:50% align:center
Why didn't All Might say
anything to me about Nighteye?

00:00:43.376 --> 00:00:44.753 position:50% align:center
[SIR NIGHTEYE]
All Might chose wrong.

00:00:44.836 --> 00:00:46.921 position:50% align:center
Mirio should have
inherited the power.

00:00:47.005 --> 00:00:50.300 position:50% align:center
[ALL MIGHT] I just don't wanna
have to talk to the guy.

00:00:50.383 --> 00:00:52.052 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] Something big
must have gone down

00:00:52.135 --> 00:00:55.013 position:50% align:center
if they're not even on
speaking terms anymore.

00:00:55.096 --> 00:00:56.681 position:50% align:center
Hey, we forgot something!

00:00:56.765 --> 00:00:57.724 position:50% align:center
Our hero names!

00:00:57.807 --> 00:00:59.392 position:50% align:center
We should know
each other's, right?

00:00:59.476 --> 00:01:02.520 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah, yeah,
totally. I'm Deku!

00:01:02.604 --> 00:01:05.398 position:50% align:center
Deku? Like "Deck?"
That's weird.

00:01:05.482 --> 00:01:06.775 position:50% align:center
I like it.

00:01:06.858 --> 00:01:08.485 position:50% align:center
'Kay, well, I'm Lemillion.

00:01:08.568 --> 00:01:10.320 position:50% align:center
For the number of
people I'll save.

00:01:10.403 --> 00:01:12.489 position:50% align:center
You know. Can't save 'em all.

00:01:12.572 --> 00:01:14.783 position:50% align:center
But I can at least shoot for
saving 1,000,000 instead,

00:01:14.866 --> 00:01:16.076 position:50% align:center
so that's what I'm doing!

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:17.619 position:50% align:center
When we put on our
costumes and start

00:01:17.702 --> 00:01:19.871 position:50% align:center
hittin' the streets, that's
when we become heroes!

00:01:19.954 --> 00:01:21.748 position:50% align:center
So don't let your
guard down, Deku!

00:01:21.831 --> 00:01:24.417 position:50% align:center
Got it, Lemillion!

00:01:24.501 --> 00:01:27.587 position:50% align:center
[ERI panting]

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:37.430 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] Whoa, I'm sorry.
You took a tumble.

00:01:40.809 --> 00:01:43.812 position:50% align:center
Are you okay? Can I,
uh, help you up?

00:01:43.895 --> 00:01:44.771 position:50% align:center
[ERI whimpers]

00:01:44.854 --> 00:01:46.564 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Why is she trembling?

00:01:46.648 --> 00:01:48.775 position:50% align:center
[CHISAKI]
You should be more careful.

00:01:52.654 --> 00:01:55.865 position:50% align:center
[CHISAKI] We don't wanna
cause trouble for the heroes.

00:01:58.993 --> 00:02:01.871 position:50% align:center
Be careful not to
arouse any suspicion.

00:02:04.666 --> 00:02:06.459 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
No way.

00:02:06.543 --> 00:02:11.172 position:50% align:center
And just like that,
my work study...

00:02:11.256 --> 00:02:12.674 position:50% align:center
...had begun.

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:47.811 position:50% align:center
[CHISAKI] I hope you'll
forgive my daughter, hero.

00:03:47.894 --> 00:03:49.604 position:50% align:center
I don't know what
to do with her.

00:03:49.688 --> 00:03:52.399 position:50% align:center
Always playing rough,
bumping into things.

00:03:52.482 --> 00:03:54.943 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Chisaki from Shie Hassaikai.

00:03:55.026 --> 00:03:57.487 position:50% align:center
The man Nighteye is after.

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:00.323 position:50% align:center
Whoopsie-daisy looks like
that darn mask came off again.

00:04:00.407 --> 00:04:03.743 position:50% align:center
You might wanna think about
getting it resized, my friend.

00:04:03.827 --> 00:04:06.746 position:50% align:center
I'm so sorry about that.
It was our fault, too.

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:08.456 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Right. I'm an idiot.

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:09.958 position:50% align:center
If I let him see
how freaked out I am,

00:04:10.041 --> 00:04:12.210 position:50% align:center
he'll get suspicious,
and that could screw up

00:04:12.293 --> 00:04:13.920 position:50% align:center
Nighteye's entire case.

00:04:14.004 --> 00:04:15.171 position:50% align:center
[MIRIO]
I know that mask!

00:04:15.255 --> 00:04:17.132 position:50% align:center
You must be from
the Hassaikai, right?

00:04:17.215 --> 00:04:18.925 position:50% align:center
You guys are famous around here.

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:21.511 position:50% align:center
[CHISAKI] Yeah, please
don't mind the mask.

00:04:21.594 --> 00:04:23.888 position:50% align:center
It keeps out the filth.

00:04:23.972 --> 00:04:26.808 position:50% align:center
I don't believe I've seen
you two in the area before.

00:04:26.891 --> 00:04:28.435 position:50% align:center
Right! Well, we're
still pretty new,

00:04:28.518 --> 00:04:30.186 position:50% align:center
but you probably already
guessed that much.

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:31.688 position:50% align:center
Now, on your feet, partner.

00:04:31.771 --> 00:04:33.898 position:50% align:center
Can't do much hero-ing
from down there.

00:04:33.982 --> 00:04:35.775 position:50% align:center
[MIRIO]
His guard's obviously up.

00:04:35.859 --> 00:04:37.777 position:50% align:center
I can't tell him Sir's name.

00:04:37.861 --> 00:04:40.196 position:50% align:center
[CHISAKI] So, what agency
do you belong to?

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:41.698 position:50% align:center
[MIRIO]
We're only students!

00:04:41.781 --> 00:04:44.951 position:50% align:center
Far too lowly to be claiming
association with an agency.

00:04:45.035 --> 00:04:47.620 position:50% align:center
We're just using our internships
to get some experience.

00:04:47.704 --> 00:04:48.955 position:50% align:center
Speaking of which,
we need to finish

00:04:49.039 --> 00:04:50.707 position:50% align:center
patrolling this
division by lunch.

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:52.500 position:50% align:center
Come on, let's go.

00:04:52.584 --> 00:04:53.668 position:50% align:center
Right!

00:04:56.004 --> 00:04:58.757 position:50% align:center
Please. Please don't go.

00:05:02.761 --> 00:05:05.013 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Um, excuse me.

00:05:05.096 --> 00:05:09.309 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry, but your
daughter seems scared.

00:05:09.392 --> 00:05:11.936 position:50% align:center
[CHISAKI]
A reaction to being scolded.

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:14.189 position:50% align:center
[MIRIO] You're making
him more suspicious.

00:05:14.272 --> 00:05:15.398 position:50% align:center
Sure!

00:05:15.482 --> 00:05:18.193 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Wait, but...

00:05:18.276 --> 00:05:19.277 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
This girl.

00:05:19.361 --> 00:05:21.571 position:50% align:center
She's grabbed me
and won't let go.

00:05:21.654 --> 00:05:23.406 position:50% align:center
She's got bandages all over.

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:25.408 position:50% align:center
Those are just from
"playing rough"?

00:05:27.619 --> 00:05:30.288 position:50% align:center
[CHISAKI] Eri's an
exceptionally clumsy girl.

00:05:30.372 --> 00:05:31.664 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Her whole body's shaking,

00:05:31.748 --> 00:05:35.085 position:50% align:center
but she's not making a sound.

00:05:35.168 --> 00:05:37.420 position:50% align:center
Does that seem like
it's normal to you?

00:05:37.504 --> 00:05:39.506 position:50% align:center
[CHISAKI] It's dangerous
to make assumptions

00:05:39.589 --> 00:05:42.175 position:50% align:center
about what's normal
for other people.

00:05:42.258 --> 00:05:45.178 position:50% align:center
Yeah, everybody's
different, am I right?

00:05:45.261 --> 00:05:46.680 position:50% align:center
[MIRIO]
This is bad.

00:05:46.763 --> 00:05:49.391 position:50% align:center
Chisaki obviously
doesn't want us to pry.

00:05:49.474 --> 00:05:50.558 position:50% align:center
If we spook him now,

00:05:50.642 --> 00:05:52.727 position:50% align:center
he'll be even less
likely to show himself.

00:05:52.811 --> 00:05:54.270 position:50% align:center
We have to let it go.

00:05:54.354 --> 00:05:55.730 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Togata wants us to leave,

00:05:55.814 --> 00:05:58.274 position:50% align:center
but that would only
make him more suspicious.

00:05:58.358 --> 00:06:01.528 position:50% align:center
What hero would abandon
a frightened child?

00:06:01.611 --> 00:06:02.946 position:50% align:center
[MIRIO]
When we put on our costumes

00:06:03.029 --> 00:06:05.740 position:50% align:center
and take to the streets...

00:06:05.824 --> 00:06:08.702 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
...we're heroes.

00:06:08.785 --> 00:06:12.372 position:50% align:center
Tell me. What are you
doing to this girl?

00:06:20.296 --> 00:06:21.881 position:50% align:center
[CHISAKI]
You heroes really pick up

00:06:21.965 --> 00:06:26.011 position:50% align:center
on the subtlest things,
don't you? Very well.

00:06:26.094 --> 00:06:29.014 position:50% align:center
This situation is embarrassing.

00:06:29.097 --> 00:06:32.767 position:50% align:center
So I'd prefer to discuss it
where we won't be overheard.

00:06:37.355 --> 00:06:39.274 position:50% align:center
[CHISAKI] Hard to admit
that you can't control

00:06:39.357 --> 00:06:41.985 position:50% align:center
your own child,
but lately Eri defies me

00:06:42.068 --> 00:06:43.445 position:50% align:center
no matter what I try.

00:06:43.528 --> 00:06:44.821 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
What do you try?

00:06:44.904 --> 00:06:46.906 position:50% align:center
Parenting, man. Sounds rough.

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:48.616 position:50% align:center
That can't be easy.

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:51.786 position:50% align:center
[CHISAKI sighs]
Yes, children are tricky.

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:54.873 position:50% align:center
So determined to do
whatever they want...

00:06:54.956 --> 00:06:56.249 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:06:56.332 --> 00:06:59.252 position:50% align:center
[CHISAKI] ...that sometimes
they just don't listen.

00:07:01.671 --> 00:07:02.839 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU grunts]

00:07:07.635 --> 00:07:10.847 position:50% align:center
[CHISAKI] Oh, good. Done
with your temper tantrum?

00:07:13.892 --> 00:07:16.686 position:50% align:center
Uh. Eri, are you sure?

00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:19.356 position:50% align:center
[CHISAKI]
She's always like this.

00:07:19.439 --> 00:07:21.858 position:50% align:center
Sorry to involve you
in our family drama.

00:07:21.941 --> 00:07:24.486 position:50% align:center
I'm sure you have better
things to be doing.

00:07:24.569 --> 00:07:26.529 position:50% align:center
Good luck with your internships.

00:07:26.613 --> 00:07:27.614 position:50% align:center
Wai--

00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:32.077 position:50% align:center
Eri...

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:35.455 position:50% align:center
[MIRIO] We're not going after
them. Didn't you notice?

00:07:35.538 --> 00:07:38.416 position:50% align:center
He was ready to get violent.
That's why she went back.

00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:39.417 position:50% align:center
If we keep pushing him,

00:07:39.501 --> 00:07:41.836 position:50% align:center
he's gonna be even
harder to catch.

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:44.047 position:50% align:center
For now, let's report to Sir.

00:07:51.596 --> 00:07:53.306 position:50% align:center
[BUBBLE GIRL] They may be
weaker than they used to be,

00:07:53.390 --> 00:07:56.393 position:50% align:center
but the yakuza still know
how to pick a stronghold.

00:07:56.476 --> 00:07:59.396 position:50% align:center
Nice, high walls and not
too many windows, right?

00:07:59.479 --> 00:08:01.481 position:50% align:center
Oh, hey, my phone.

00:08:01.564 --> 00:08:03.441 position:50% align:center
[SIR NIGHTEYE] After a week
and a half of surveillance,

00:08:03.525 --> 00:08:05.777 position:50% align:center
I feel that there are fewer
comings and goings today.

00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:07.487 position:50% align:center
[BUBBLE GIRL]
What?

00:08:07.570 --> 00:08:08.947 position:50% align:center
It's Million.

00:08:09.030 --> 00:08:12.659 position:50% align:center
He says they came into
contact with Chisaki.

00:08:12.742 --> 00:08:15.870 position:50% align:center
[CHISAKI] The young people
today are sicker than ever.

00:08:15.954 --> 00:08:17.330 position:50% align:center
Chrono, prepare the bath.

00:08:17.414 --> 00:08:18.581 position:50% align:center
[KURONO]
Yes, sir.

00:08:18.665 --> 00:08:19.749 position:50% align:center
[HASSAIKAI MEMBER 67A]
I'm real sorry, Boss.

00:08:19.833 --> 00:08:22.168 position:50% align:center
I swear, I barely
took my eyes off her.

00:08:22.252 --> 00:08:23.545 position:50% align:center
The kid made a break for i--

00:08:24.587 --> 00:08:26.131 position:50% align:center
[CHISAKI]
And clean that up.

00:08:26.214 --> 00:08:27.340 position:50% align:center
[KURONO]
Right.

00:08:28.675 --> 00:08:30.593 position:50% align:center
[CHISAKI]
This is maddening.

00:08:30.677 --> 00:08:34.431 position:50% align:center
They're all infected
with hero syndrome.

00:08:34.514 --> 00:08:36.474 position:50% align:center
[MIRIO]
Sorry! It was a total oops.

00:08:36.558 --> 00:08:38.268 position:50% align:center
I mean, wow, what are
the odds of randomly

00:08:38.351 --> 00:08:40.645 position:50% align:center
running into a target
on the street like that?

00:08:40.729 --> 00:08:43.606 position:50% align:center
No, I must
accept responsibility.

00:08:43.690 --> 00:08:45.358 position:50% align:center
I should have used
Foresight on you two.

00:08:45.442 --> 00:08:46.359 position:50% align:center
It's my fault.

00:08:46.443 --> 00:08:48.236 position:50% align:center
I'm just glad
you guys are okay.

00:08:48.319 --> 00:08:51.114 position:50% align:center
You could've been in danger
if he'd suspected something.

00:08:51.197 --> 00:08:53.825 position:50% align:center
It didn't feel all
that scary to me.

00:08:53.908 --> 00:08:55.535 position:50% align:center
Chisaki and his
gang were involved

00:08:55.618 --> 00:08:58.955 position:50% align:center
in a recent traffic accident
caused by a group of hoodlums.

00:08:59.039 --> 00:09:01.458 position:50% align:center
Which isn't remarkable
in and of itself.

00:09:01.541 --> 00:09:04.294 position:50% align:center
Except, there were
zero casualties.

00:09:04.377 --> 00:09:06.254 position:50% align:center
The thieves experienced
intense pain

00:09:06.338 --> 00:09:09.591 position:50% align:center
and lost consciousness,
but they were uninjured

00:09:09.674 --> 00:09:11.634 position:50% align:center
and even reported that
preexisting ailments

00:09:11.718 --> 00:09:14.596 position:50% align:center
like rheumatism and cavities
were completely gone.

00:09:14.679 --> 00:09:16.639 position:50% align:center
[SIR NIGHTEYE] The authorities
believed Chisaki's Quirk

00:09:16.723 --> 00:09:19.059 position:50% align:center
may have been responsible,
but with the villains

00:09:19.142 --> 00:09:21.519 position:50% align:center
caught and nobody harmed,
there was no crime

00:09:21.603 --> 00:09:23.146 position:50% align:center
to accuse him of.

00:09:23.229 --> 00:09:24.898 position:50% align:center
[BUBBLE GIRL] The money
that was stolen burned up,

00:09:24.981 --> 00:09:27.567 position:50% align:center
so there was nothing
left to recover.

00:09:27.650 --> 00:09:29.611 position:50% align:center
The police didn't find
any sign of a crime

00:09:29.694 --> 00:09:31.488 position:50% align:center
in that regard, either,
but the whole thing

00:09:31.571 --> 00:09:33.615 position:50% align:center
seemed suspicious,
so Nighteye Agency

00:09:33.698 --> 00:09:35.408 position:50% align:center
began watching Hassaikai.

00:09:35.492 --> 00:09:37.369 position:50% align:center
We haven't figured
out what it is yet,

00:09:37.452 --> 00:09:39.621 position:50% align:center
but we know they're
up to something.

00:09:39.704 --> 00:09:42.207 position:50% align:center
Oh, I forgot. Sir.

00:09:42.290 --> 00:09:44.209 position:50% align:center
We got lucky--at least a little.

00:09:44.292 --> 00:09:46.544 position:50% align:center
Our brief encounter
yielded some new intel.

00:09:46.628 --> 00:09:48.546 position:50% align:center
Chisaki, he has a daughter.

00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:49.881 position:50% align:center
A daughter?

00:09:49.964 --> 00:09:52.258 position:50% align:center
A little girl who
he called "Eri."

00:09:52.342 --> 00:09:54.719 position:50% align:center
Her limbs were all
wrapped in bandages.

00:09:54.803 --> 00:09:56.805 position:50% align:center
I don't know anything
else about her,

00:09:56.888 --> 00:09:59.099 position:50% align:center
but she was asking for help.

00:09:59.182 --> 00:10:01.935 position:50% align:center
There must be something
we can do to protect her.

00:10:02.018 --> 00:10:05.939 position:50% align:center
I won't let your arrogance
interfere with this case.

00:10:06.022 --> 00:10:07.148 position:50% align:center
But, Sir...

00:10:07.232 --> 00:10:09.275 position:50% align:center
[SIR NIGHTEYE]
Haste won't help the situation.

00:10:09.359 --> 00:10:11.778 position:50% align:center
Take your time
pursuing a target.

00:10:11.861 --> 00:10:15.907 position:50% align:center
If you rush, they are that
much more likely to escape.

00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:17.826 position:50% align:center
You're not so special
that you can save

00:10:17.909 --> 00:10:21.204 position:50% align:center
whoever you want
whenever you want.

00:10:21.287 --> 00:10:23.915 position:50% align:center
We've asked other agencies
to team up with us.

00:10:23.998 --> 00:10:25.917 position:50% align:center
We must first predict
our opponent's moves

00:10:26.001 --> 00:10:28.461 position:50% align:center
and then make
preparations to face him.

00:10:28.545 --> 00:10:32.215 position:50% align:center
Good intentions alone aren't
enough to save the world.

00:10:32.298 --> 00:10:35.427 position:50% align:center
The wisest villains
hide in the shadows.

00:10:35.510 --> 00:10:39.556 position:50% align:center
In order to find them,
we must watch and wait.

00:10:39.639 --> 00:10:42.517 position:50% align:center
The two of you should head
back into the office for today.

00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:44.394 position:50% align:center
Bubble Girl. Let's go.

00:10:44.477 --> 00:10:45.645 position:50% align:center
Yes, sir.

00:10:47.063 --> 00:10:51.693 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] And so, the first day
of my work study ended,

00:10:51.776 --> 00:10:54.738 position:50% align:center
leaving me with a sick
feeling in my stomach.

00:10:57.157 --> 00:11:00.910 position:50% align:center
[CHISAKI] Eri, you have to stop
disobeying me like this.

00:11:00.994 --> 00:11:03.329 position:50% align:center
You're the core of
my plan, you know,

00:11:03.413 --> 00:11:07.167 position:50% align:center
and I would hate to have
to get my hands dirty.

00:11:07.250 --> 00:11:09.502 position:50% align:center
[MIMIC]
Overhaul, got a sec?

00:11:09.586 --> 00:11:12.464 position:50% align:center
It's Shigaraki from
the League of Villains.

00:11:12.547 --> 00:11:15.008 position:50% align:center line:10%
He says that he's got
an answer for ya.

00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:24.726 position:50% align:center
So, like. What
happened to Bakugo?

00:11:24.809 --> 00:11:25.935 position:50% align:center
Was he fighting again?

00:11:26.019 --> 00:11:27.896 position:50% align:center
He's not the only
one busted up.

00:11:27.979 --> 00:11:29.731 position:50% align:center
Look at the back of the room.

00:11:29.814 --> 00:11:32.484 position:50% align:center
[ASHIDO] His beautiful face!
Who would do such a thing?

00:11:32.567 --> 00:11:35.070 position:50% align:center
The provisional license
classes sure sound tough.

00:11:35.153 --> 00:11:36.654 position:50% align:center
Must be great workouts, though!

00:11:36.738 --> 00:11:39.366 position:50% align:center
Stop talking like I'm not here!

00:11:39.449 --> 00:11:40.784 position:50% align:center
Class is starting now.

00:11:40.867 --> 00:11:43.286 position:50% align:center
Sadly, I must mark Tsu
and Uraraka tardy.

00:11:43.370 --> 00:11:45.163 position:50% align:center
Their absences are excused.

00:11:45.246 --> 00:11:47.123 position:50% align:center
Kirishima isn't here
either, is he?

00:11:47.207 --> 00:11:48.416 position:50% align:center
Oh, you didn't hear?

00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:50.710 position:50% align:center
Those three found places
to do work studies.

00:11:50.794 --> 00:11:51.586 position:50% align:center
Whoa, for real?

00:11:51.670 --> 00:11:53.129 position:50% align:center
Hey, how'd your work study go?

00:11:53.213 --> 00:11:56.716 position:50% align:center
Were there lotsa scantily-clad
heroines at the agency, huh?

00:11:56.800 --> 00:11:57.967 position:50% align:center
Yeah, sure.

00:11:58.051 --> 00:12:00.720 position:50% align:center
I don't wanna hear about
you getting ahead of me!

00:12:08.978 --> 00:12:12.190 position:50% align:center
[ERI]
Please. Please don't go.

00:12:15.235 --> 00:12:18.613 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] My pent-up
frustrations got worse.

00:12:18.697 --> 00:12:21.116 position:50% align:center
I couldn't concentrate in class.

00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:26.246 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] Something had
to change and fast!

00:12:26.329 --> 00:12:28.248 position:50% align:center
All Might's out
jogging right now.

00:12:28.331 --> 00:12:29.082 position:50% align:center
Uh...

00:12:29.165 --> 00:12:30.500 position:50% align:center
I figured you knew.

00:12:30.583 --> 00:12:32.043 position:50% align:center
He's been working out
a lot ever since

00:12:32.127 --> 00:12:34.045 position:50% align:center
the home visits were completed.

00:12:34.129 --> 00:12:38.425 position:50% align:center
I say he should take it
easy since he's retired.

00:12:38.508 --> 00:12:41.261 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
All Might! Please.

00:12:41.344 --> 00:12:43.805 position:50% align:center
You've got to tell
me everything.

00:12:45.849 --> 00:12:47.350 position:50% align:center
[coughs]

00:12:47.434 --> 00:12:49.060 position:50% align:center
[rumbling]

00:12:49.144 --> 00:12:51.396 position:50% align:center
I have to talk
to you, All Might!

00:12:51.479 --> 00:12:54.607 position:50% align:center
Whoa, okay, Young
Midoriya is here!

00:12:54.691 --> 00:12:57.610 position:50% align:center
Hold on, how did you
even know where I was?

00:13:01.698 --> 00:13:04.993 position:50% align:center
You knew what I
was walking into.

00:13:05.076 --> 00:13:07.829 position:50% align:center
Nighteye understands how
One For All works.

00:13:07.912 --> 00:13:10.999 position:50% align:center
And he wanted you to pass
it on to Togata, not me.

00:13:11.082 --> 00:13:13.668 position:50% align:center
You had to know I'd
find out everything.

00:13:13.752 --> 00:13:17.088 position:50% align:center
So why didn't you
warn me about it?

00:13:17.172 --> 00:13:19.591 position:50% align:center
[ALL MIGHT] I wasn't sure
it was my place to tell you.

00:13:19.674 --> 00:13:21.217 position:50% align:center
Of course it was!

00:13:21.301 --> 00:13:22.969 position:50% align:center
To hear all of this at once...

00:13:23.053 --> 00:13:25.055 position:50% align:center
Be rejected by him...

00:13:25.138 --> 00:13:28.099 position:50% align:center
And before I even had a chance
to make sense of it all.

00:13:28.183 --> 00:13:31.311 position:50% align:center
The worst part was not knowing
why you kept it a secret.

00:13:31.394 --> 00:13:33.104 position:50% align:center
How I should feel about it.

00:13:33.188 --> 00:13:35.523 position:50% align:center
I need to know
everything, All Might.

00:13:35.607 --> 00:13:38.193 position:50% align:center
Not as your fan,
but as your successor.

00:13:42.197 --> 00:13:43.865 position:50% align:center
I didn't think knowing
this information

00:13:43.948 --> 00:13:45.992 position:50% align:center
would help with
your development.

00:13:46.076 --> 00:13:47.994 position:50% align:center
But if you really
want the truth...

00:13:48.078 --> 00:13:51.664 position:50% align:center
Anything's better than having
you keep secrets from me.

00:13:51.748 --> 00:13:54.292 position:50% align:center
[ALL MIGHT]
You may regret this.

00:13:54.376 --> 00:13:55.585 position:50% align:center
I won't.

00:13:57.504 --> 00:14:01.758 position:50% align:center
Okay. So Nighteye had
always been a fan of mine.

00:14:01.841 --> 00:14:04.803 position:50% align:center
It was my policy not
to take on sidekicks,

00:14:04.886 --> 00:14:08.765 position:50% align:center
but eventually I gave in and
let him be my number two.

00:14:08.848 --> 00:14:11.393 position:50% align:center
We worked together
for about five years.

00:14:11.476 --> 00:14:14.187 position:50% align:center
He was the brain
behind my operations.

00:14:14.270 --> 00:14:17.691 position:50% align:center
I know that much. I also
know you two got along.

00:14:17.774 --> 00:14:19.025 position:50% align:center
We did.

00:14:19.109 --> 00:14:22.362 position:50% align:center
But, six years ago,
we dissolved our partnership

00:14:22.445 --> 00:14:25.240 position:50% align:center
because of my injury.

00:14:25.323 --> 00:14:28.743 position:50% align:center
Turns out we had
different values.

00:14:28.827 --> 00:14:31.329 position:50% align:center
[SIR NIGHTEYE]
This is reckless, All Might.

00:14:31.413 --> 00:14:34.249 position:50% align:center
It's time for you to step down.

00:14:34.332 --> 00:14:38.044 position:50% align:center
But everyone's looking
to me. For my help.

00:14:38.128 --> 00:14:40.005 position:50% align:center
If there are
frightened citizens,

00:14:40.088 --> 00:14:41.798 position:50% align:center
then I have to go to them.

00:14:41.881 --> 00:14:43.550 position:50% align:center
Keep doing hero
work in that body,

00:14:43.633 --> 00:14:46.344 position:50% align:center
and the entire world
is going to suffer.

00:14:46.428 --> 00:14:48.054 position:50% align:center
If you wish for enduring peace,

00:14:48.138 --> 00:14:50.724 position:50% align:center
then retire while
you're a legend.

00:14:50.807 --> 00:14:52.142 position:50% align:center
If you're looking
for a successor,

00:14:52.225 --> 00:14:53.893 position:50% align:center
why not search at UA?

00:14:53.977 --> 00:14:56.187 position:50% align:center
You've put in your dues
and more, All Might.

00:14:56.271 --> 00:14:58.314 position:50% align:center
Imagine what your
future could be like.

00:14:58.398 --> 00:14:59.899 position:50% align:center
A comfortable life.

00:14:59.983 --> 00:15:02.402 position:50% align:center
Just find a cheerful
and strong replacement

00:15:02.485 --> 00:15:05.113 position:50% align:center
and entrust your role
in society to them.

00:15:05.196 --> 00:15:06.614 position:50% align:center
It's time.

00:15:06.698 --> 00:15:09.784 position:50% align:center
And who will be the Symbol
until I find someone like that?

00:15:09.868 --> 00:15:12.078 position:50% align:center
Even if All For One is beaten.

00:15:12.162 --> 00:15:14.372 position:50% align:center
Another villain
will replace him.

00:15:14.456 --> 00:15:16.916 position:50% align:center
[SIR NIGHTEYE] I know the
importance of the Symbol!

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:18.752 position:50% align:center
I revere its function.

00:15:18.835 --> 00:15:21.004 position:50% align:center
But please. All Might.

00:15:21.087 --> 00:15:23.465 position:50% align:center
You can't even smile right now.

00:15:24.466 --> 00:15:27.927 position:50% align:center
[SIR NIGHTEYE] I'll say
it again. You must retire.

00:15:28.011 --> 00:15:30.472 position:50% align:center
If you continue your
hero activities like this,

00:15:30.555 --> 00:15:35.060 position:50% align:center
I won't support you.
I won't. I can't.

00:15:35.143 --> 00:15:39.564 position:50% align:center
[gasps] You saw it, didn't you?

00:15:39.647 --> 00:15:42.567 position:50% align:center
I told you not to use
your Foresight on me.

00:15:42.650 --> 00:15:46.029 position:50% align:center
If you step away now,
another number one will appear.

00:15:46.112 --> 00:15:47.739 position:50% align:center
Things may be rough
for a little while,

00:15:47.822 --> 00:15:48.948 position:50% align:center
but we'll survive.

00:15:49.032 --> 00:15:51.743 position:50% align:center
We'll find a way
through it together.

00:15:51.826 --> 00:15:54.120 position:50% align:center
And while we're
figuring this all out,

00:15:54.204 --> 00:15:57.624 position:50% align:center
how many people will have
to fear for their lives?

00:15:57.707 --> 00:15:58.875 position:50% align:center
Listen to us!

00:15:58.958 --> 00:16:01.544 position:50% align:center
Besides, your Foresight
is never wrong,

00:16:01.628 --> 00:16:02.796 position:50% align:center
so why fight this.

00:16:02.879 --> 00:16:04.964 position:50% align:center
There just hasn't been
any precedent for it!

00:16:05.048 --> 00:16:08.718 position:50% align:center
But I think... I can
change the future!

00:16:08.802 --> 00:16:10.804 position:50% align:center
At this rate, events will
play out as I've seen.

00:16:10.887 --> 00:16:13.890 position:50% align:center
That can't happen!
Don't you see?

00:16:13.973 --> 00:16:16.768 position:50% align:center
I'm here because I want
to do something to help you!

00:16:16.851 --> 00:16:19.312 position:50% align:center
Please, All Might!

00:16:19.396 --> 00:16:23.149 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry, but for the
sake of this world,

00:16:23.233 --> 00:16:26.611 position:50% align:center
I have to be able to say
that I am still here.

00:16:26.695 --> 00:16:27.987 position:50% align:center
Please! Stop!

00:16:28.071 --> 00:16:30.156 position:50% align:center
If you continue like
this, you'll face off

00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:34.911 position:50% align:center
against a villain and die an
unspeakably gruesome death.

00:16:36.496 --> 00:16:39.541 position:50% align:center
[ALL MIGHT] The two of us parted
ways after that argument.

00:16:40.834 --> 00:16:43.795 position:50% align:center
[ALL MIGHT] We couldn't
agree about my future.

00:16:43.878 --> 00:16:46.798 position:50% align:center
Principal Nezu recommended
Young Togata to me,

00:16:46.881 --> 00:16:52.095 position:50% align:center
but before I could meet him,
I ended up running into you.

00:16:54.389 --> 00:16:57.934 position:50% align:center
[ALL MIGHT] I'm sorry.
I didn't want to tell you.

00:16:58.018 --> 00:17:02.105 position:50% align:center
Because... Because
you're my fan.

00:17:08.987 --> 00:17:13.533 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
All Might's... going to die?

00:17:13.616 --> 00:17:17.954 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] That's when it
really hit me. Death.

00:17:18.038 --> 00:17:21.207 position:50% align:center
I'd known something
bad was coming.

00:17:21.291 --> 00:17:25.795 position:50% align:center
And everyone will
die someday. But...

00:17:25.879 --> 00:17:30.175 position:50% align:center
Being forced to hear it
from All Might himself...

00:17:30.258 --> 00:17:32.218 position:50% align:center
He'll die.

00:17:32.302 --> 00:17:33.928 position:50% align:center
[ALL MIGHT]
After we met and I decided

00:17:34.012 --> 00:17:36.264 position:50% align:center
I would pass my power onto you,

00:17:36.348 --> 00:17:38.725 position:50% align:center
I told Nighteye my plan.

00:17:38.808 --> 00:17:41.478 position:50% align:center
But he was so
opposed to the idea,

00:17:41.561 --> 00:17:44.773 position:50% align:center
and the rift between
us grew even deeper.

00:17:44.856 --> 00:17:46.191 position:50% align:center
You're passing your One For All

00:17:46.274 --> 00:17:48.568 position:50% align:center
onto a Quirkless
middle school student?

00:17:48.651 --> 00:17:50.862 position:50% align:center
[coughs] It's the
right choice to make.

00:17:50.945 --> 00:17:52.489 position:50% align:center
The boy wants to save people.

00:17:52.572 --> 00:17:54.741 position:50% align:center
He can't do that
with intentions alone!

00:17:54.824 --> 00:17:59.412 position:50% align:center
There are any number of other
people who are more suitable!

00:17:59.496 --> 00:18:02.624 position:50% align:center
Perhaps. But that doesn't
mean he's not worthy.

00:18:02.707 --> 00:18:06.044 position:50% align:center
He will wield One For All next.

00:18:06.127 --> 00:18:08.213 position:50% align:center
[ALL MIGHT]
He rejected my decision.

00:18:08.296 --> 00:18:11.091 position:50% align:center
He thought I was an idiot,
throwing my power away.

00:18:11.174 --> 00:18:14.636 position:50% align:center
So he started training a
candidate he thought was better.

00:18:14.719 --> 00:18:17.263 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] Wait, hold up.
All Might, please.

00:18:17.347 --> 00:18:20.016 position:50% align:center
Tell me about Nighteye's vision.

00:18:20.100 --> 00:18:22.060 position:50% align:center
How far into the future was it?

00:18:22.143 --> 00:18:24.312 position:50% align:center
[ALL MIGHT]
Six or seven years.

00:18:24.396 --> 00:18:25.939 position:50% align:center
The further into
the future he sees,

00:18:26.022 --> 00:18:28.900 position:50% align:center
the harder it is to know exactly
when something will happen.

00:18:28.983 --> 00:18:31.403 position:50% align:center
But his Foresight
has never been wrong.

00:18:31.486 --> 00:18:35.365 position:50% align:center
Wait, then that would be
this year or the next.

00:18:35.448 --> 00:18:39.744 position:50% align:center
You're kidding. Right?
This can't happen.

00:18:39.828 --> 00:18:42.372 position:50% align:center
I want you to live, All Might!

00:18:42.455 --> 00:18:45.625 position:50% align:center
Do you remember what you
said at the sports festival?

00:18:45.709 --> 00:18:46.835 position:50% align:center
Our promise?

00:18:46.918 --> 00:18:48.628 position:50% align:center
[ALL MIGHT]
I want you to introduce yourself

00:18:48.712 --> 00:18:53.133 position:50% align:center
to the world and
proudly say "I am here!"

00:18:53.216 --> 00:18:56.594 position:50% align:center
I can't do that yet. So live.

00:18:56.678 --> 00:18:59.681 position:50% align:center
Until I can keep our pact.

00:18:59.764 --> 00:19:02.058 position:50% align:center
Watch me tell them "I am here."

00:19:02.142 --> 00:19:07.105 position:50% align:center
I need you here.
Don't you understand?

00:19:07.188 --> 00:19:08.606 position:50% align:center
Young Midoriya.

00:19:08.690 --> 00:19:11.651 position:50% align:center
Back then, when I
heard I would die,

00:19:11.735 --> 00:19:13.820 position:50% align:center
I accepted that as my future.

00:19:13.903 --> 00:19:15.405 position:50% align:center
I just figured...

00:19:15.488 --> 00:19:17.115 position:50% align:center
...I'd keep running
at full speed

00:19:17.198 --> 00:19:18.825 position:50% align:center
until I got to the finish line.

00:19:18.908 --> 00:19:20.660 position:50% align:center
All Might.

00:19:20.744 --> 00:19:22.996 position:50% align:center
And then, when I was
fighting All For One,

00:19:23.079 --> 00:19:26.291 position:50% align:center
I thought that would be
the end of the race.

00:19:26.374 --> 00:19:29.252 position:50% align:center
But, you were there, kiddo.

00:19:31.463 --> 00:19:33.548 position:50% align:center
You see, all those
days we spent

00:19:33.631 --> 00:19:36.134 position:50% align:center
with one another affected me.

00:19:36.217 --> 00:19:37.844 position:50% align:center
You were timid and Quirkless,

00:19:37.927 --> 00:19:40.388 position:50% align:center
but you had heart.
And then your mother told me

00:19:40.472 --> 00:19:43.266 position:50% align:center
to live so I could protect
and help raise you...

00:19:43.350 --> 00:19:45.185 position:50% align:center
So, despite my future,

00:19:45.268 --> 00:19:48.396 position:50% align:center
I'll keep fighting with you
by my side, Young Midoriya.

00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:50.440 position:50% align:center
Because you have changed me,

00:19:50.523 --> 00:19:52.525 position:50% align:center
I promise that I will live.

00:19:52.609 --> 00:19:54.444 position:50% align:center
I won't be killed.

00:19:54.527 --> 00:19:56.988 position:50% align:center
I will mold my fate and
strike down anything else

00:19:57.072 --> 00:19:59.616 position:50% align:center
that gets in our way
with this fist.

00:20:02.118 --> 00:20:07.707 position:50% align:center
[ALL MIGHT] I'll keep on living.
I won't let them end me.

00:20:07.791 --> 00:20:12.671 position:50% align:center
The future that's been foretold
will not come to pass.

00:20:12.754 --> 00:20:16.716 position:50% align:center
That's what I have
resolved, All For One.

00:20:18.385 --> 00:20:22.097 position:50% align:center
But you see, so far everything
has been as he said.

00:20:22.180 --> 00:20:26.142 position:50% align:center
In each case, Nighteye's
predictions have come true.

00:20:26.226 --> 00:20:30.647 position:50% align:center
And that's why I can't face
him after all these years.

00:20:30.730 --> 00:20:32.315 position:50% align:center
Please know I never
wanted to become

00:20:32.399 --> 00:20:34.693 position:50% align:center
a shackle holding you back.

00:20:34.776 --> 00:20:36.319 position:50% align:center
Hey. Who knows,
maybe I've already

00:20:36.403 --> 00:20:39.864 position:50% align:center
reshaped my destiny
into the future I wanted.

00:20:39.948 --> 00:20:41.741 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Not yet.

00:20:41.825 --> 00:20:45.161 position:50% align:center
We can't be positive his
prediction won't come true.

00:20:45.245 --> 00:20:48.748 position:50% align:center
It can't happen.
I refuse to let it.

00:20:51.251 --> 00:20:54.504 position:50% align:center
That's why, no matter
what happens to you,

00:20:54.587 --> 00:20:57.215 position:50% align:center
I'll be there
to help fight fate.

00:21:10.061 --> 00:21:13.440 position:50% align:center
I'll try not to be too
much trouble. I promise.

00:21:18.028 --> 00:21:19.612 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Hold on.

00:21:19.696 --> 00:21:22.198 position:50% align:center
Have Nighteye use his
Foresight on you again!

00:21:22.282 --> 00:21:23.658 position:50% align:center
Make up with him!

00:21:23.742 --> 00:21:25.702 position:50% align:center
Then we'll see if the future
has already been changed!

00:21:25.785 --> 00:21:28.204 position:50% align:center
Uh-- Doesn't that seem
a little--I don't know...

00:21:28.288 --> 00:21:30.123 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
It's a matter of life and death!

00:21:30.206 --> 00:21:31.166 position:50% align:center
I'll try to bargain with him.

00:21:31.249 --> 00:21:32.542 position:50% align:center
[ALL MIGHT]
Wait, Young Midoriya.

00:21:32.625 --> 00:21:35.420 position:50% align:center
Think about how Nighteye
must feel about all this!

00:23:08.179 --> 00:23:10.807 position:50% align:center
[SHIGARAKI]
What a boring office.

00:23:10.890 --> 00:23:14.102 position:50% align:center
[CHISAKI] I don't like
overly cluttered rooms.

00:23:14.185 --> 00:23:16.229 position:50% align:center
[SHIGARAKI] You had me walking
in circles underground

00:23:16.312 --> 00:23:18.648 position:50% align:center
for 30 minutes. I'm not an ant.

00:23:18.732 --> 00:23:20.400 position:50% align:center
[MIMIC] More importantly,
did you really mean

00:23:20.483 --> 00:23:22.569 position:50% align:center
what you said on the
phone the other day?

00:23:22.652 --> 00:23:25.530 position:50% align:center
That you'll join us
under the right conditions?

00:23:29.576 --> 00:23:30.910 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Here's the preview!

00:23:30.994 --> 00:23:33.705 position:50% align:center
Kirishima is doing his work
study at Fatgum's agency

00:23:33.788 --> 00:23:36.833 position:50% align:center
in Kansai. There, he
teams up with Amajiki,

00:23:36.916 --> 00:23:38.585 position:50% align:center
one of UA's Big Three.

00:23:38.668 --> 00:23:40.628 position:50% align:center
When the group finds
themselves facing off against

00:23:40.712 --> 00:23:43.548 position:50% align:center
a gang of street thugs,
Kirishima is pitted against

00:23:43.631 --> 00:23:45.550 position:50% align:center
an opponent with
a boosted Quirk.

00:23:45.633 --> 00:23:47.552 position:50% align:center
Will he be able to
stop the criminal?

00:23:47.635 --> 00:23:50.555 position:50% align:center
Next time: "Let's Go,
Gutsy Red Riot!"

00:23:50.638 --> 00:23:51.973 position:50% align:center
Come on, Kirishima!

00:23:52.057 --> 00:23:54.684 position:50% align:center
Show them the results of
your intensive training.

00:23:54.768 --> 00:23:57.187 position:50% align:center
Go beyond! Plus Ultra!
