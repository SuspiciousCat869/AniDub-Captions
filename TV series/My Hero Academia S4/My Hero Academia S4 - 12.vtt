00:00:12.262 --> 00:00:16.057 position:50% align:center
[CHISAKI] You wanted to
become a hero so badly.

00:00:16.141 --> 00:00:18.935 position:50% align:center
And you couldn't even save Eri.

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:22.439 position:50% align:center
You're filthy,
Lemillion. Infected.

00:00:22.522 --> 00:00:25.358 position:50% align:center
But I'll fix you all
with her power.

00:00:25.442 --> 00:00:28.778 position:50% align:center
Every last one of you.

00:00:28.862 --> 00:00:34.075 position:50% align:center
[MIRIO] Nighteye. Tamaki.
I'm still fighting.

00:00:34.159 --> 00:00:35.618 position:50% align:center
Chisaki!

00:00:35.702 --> 00:00:39.205 position:50% align:center
[CHISAKI] I told you
that's not my name anymore!

00:02:16.094 --> 00:02:17.971 position:50% align:center
[DETECTIVE 70A] The walls
have finally stopped moving.

00:02:18.054 --> 00:02:20.557 position:50% align:center
but it's hard to tell
where we are now.

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.726 position:50% align:center
I'm positive Eri's
bedroom is located

00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:23.935 position:50% align:center
in that direction.

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:25.478 position:50% align:center
Irinaka!

00:02:25.562 --> 00:02:28.064 position:50% align:center
I want you to straighten out
these hallways again, you hear?

00:02:29.607 --> 00:02:30.525 position:50% align:center
The hell?

00:02:30.608 --> 00:02:33.028 position:50% align:center
The drugs must've worn off.

00:02:33.111 --> 00:02:34.612 position:50% align:center
[LOCKLOCK] He's not supposed
to be able to control

00:02:34.696 --> 00:02:36.614 position:50% align:center
anything larger than
a damn refrigerator.

00:02:36.698 --> 00:02:38.199 position:50% align:center
[FATGUM] Remember who
we're dealin' with here.

00:02:38.283 --> 00:02:41.369 position:50% align:center
Dollars to doughnuts, he's using
a performance-enhancer.

00:02:41.453 --> 00:02:44.122 position:50% align:center
Looks like Fatgum knew
what he was talking about.

00:02:44.205 --> 00:02:46.624 position:50% align:center
Irinaka's power:
it's back to normal again.

00:02:46.708 --> 00:02:50.337 position:50% align:center
Guess that's good news. But that
was Toga and Twice just now.

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:52.422 position:50% align:center
The League of Villains
is here, too.

00:02:52.505 --> 00:02:57.552 position:50% align:center
[MIMIC growls]
Toga. Toga and Twice.

00:02:57.635 --> 00:03:01.097 position:50% align:center
I won't forgive you!
You traitors will die!

00:03:01.181 --> 00:03:03.516 position:50% align:center
Tell us where the other
League members are hiding.

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:06.603 position:50% align:center
I don't know! But I'll find
every last one of 'em!

00:03:06.686 --> 00:03:11.441 position:50% align:center
I won't stop until I've crushed
all their skulls to dust!

00:03:11.524 --> 00:03:12.609 position:50% align:center
I'm guessing those two

00:03:12.692 --> 00:03:14.986 position:50% align:center
are the only ones here.
At least for now.

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:16.154 position:50% align:center
It doesn't look
like the villains

00:03:16.237 --> 00:03:17.614 position:50% align:center
from the League are
gonna attack us.

00:03:17.697 --> 00:03:19.282 position:50% align:center
Maybe not but they're
not on our side

00:03:19.366 --> 00:03:21.117 position:50% align:center
just because they
betrayed this guy.

00:03:21.201 --> 00:03:23.620 position:50% align:center
Those criminals are wanted
across the country.

00:03:23.703 --> 00:03:26.373 position:50% align:center
As officers of the law,
we can't let them escape.

00:03:26.456 --> 00:03:28.291 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU gasps]

00:03:28.375 --> 00:03:31.127 position:50% align:center
So far, the chances
are relatively low

00:03:31.211 --> 00:03:33.505 position:50% align:center
that the League will be
involved in this raid.

00:03:33.588 --> 00:03:35.840 position:50% align:center
But if they do end up
putting in an appearance,

00:03:35.924 --> 00:03:38.510 position:50% align:center
you guys are out.

00:03:38.593 --> 00:03:40.762 position:50% align:center
Eraser Head.

00:03:40.845 --> 00:03:43.431 position:50% align:center
Why're you fools standin' around
talkin' instead of actin'?

00:03:43.515 --> 00:03:44.599 position:50% align:center
What do you mean?

00:03:44.683 --> 00:03:46.393 position:50% align:center
The cops can deal
with the League!

00:03:46.476 --> 00:03:47.811 position:50% align:center
You're wastin' time,
so ignore them

00:03:47.894 --> 00:03:49.020 position:50% align:center
and keep on movin'.

00:03:49.104 --> 00:03:50.480 position:50% align:center
Or did you morons
forget our mission's

00:03:50.563 --> 00:03:51.940 position:50% align:center
top freakin' priority?

00:03:52.023 --> 00:03:53.358 position:50% align:center
He has a point.

00:03:53.441 --> 00:03:55.610 position:50% align:center
That would be for the best.

00:03:55.694 --> 00:03:57.028 position:50% align:center
[LOCKLOCK]
I'll hang tight.

00:03:57.112 --> 00:03:59.531 position:50% align:center
Someone has to stay behind
to keep an eye on Irinaka.

00:03:59.614 --> 00:04:01.199 position:50% align:center
And thanks to the crazy
girl with the knives,

00:04:01.282 --> 00:04:04.077 position:50% align:center
I'm not goin' anywhere
anytime soon.

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:04.953 position:50% align:center
Well, go on!

00:04:05.036 --> 00:04:06.454 position:50% align:center
Finish what we came here to do.

00:04:06.538 --> 00:04:08.707 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:11.251 position:50% align:center
[LOCKLOCK] Ryukyu and
the other heroes up top.

00:04:11.334 --> 00:04:13.920 position:50% align:center
The cops we got separated
from down here!

Fatgum! Lemillion!

00:04:19.718 --> 00:04:20.885 position:50% align:center
They're all still
fightin' for us.

00:04:20.969 --> 00:04:22.387 position:50% align:center
You gotta know that, right?

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:25.432 position:50% align:center
We worked too damn hard
to fail that girl now.

00:04:25.515 --> 00:04:27.183 position:50% align:center
So go on!

00:04:31.938 --> 00:04:34.774 position:50% align:center
[pants]

00:04:34.858 --> 00:04:37.152 position:50% align:center
We'll find her.
And we'll save her!

00:04:37.235 --> 00:04:39.112 position:50% align:center
Don't worry, Locklock.

00:04:41.698 --> 00:04:45.744 position:50% align:center
[LOCKLOCK] Hope they didn't
take my yellin' the wrong way.

00:04:45.827 --> 00:04:48.163 position:50% align:center
I just can't help
thinkin' about my family.

00:04:48.246 --> 00:04:52.042 position:50% align:center
I got a beautiful wife.
And a new baby boy.

00:04:52.125 --> 00:04:56.129 position:50% align:center
[LOCKLOCK'S WIFE]
He looks just like his daddy!

00:04:56.212 --> 00:04:58.423 position:50% align:center
[LOCKLOCK]
I was worried about those kids.

00:04:58.506 --> 00:05:00.633 position:50% align:center
They might be trainin'
to be heroes,

00:05:00.717 --> 00:05:02.927 position:50% align:center
but they're still so young.

00:05:03.011 --> 00:05:04.512 position:50% align:center
Then, I watched them
act more heroically

00:05:04.596 --> 00:05:06.556 position:50% align:center
than any of us pros.

00:05:09.559 --> 00:05:12.228 position:50% align:center
So, you're promisin'
to save the girl.

00:05:12.312 --> 00:05:14.272 position:50% align:center
Then you better do it, Deku!

00:05:14.356 --> 00:05:16.399 position:50% align:center
Same goes for you, Nighteye!

00:05:16.483 --> 00:05:19.152 position:50% align:center
Her future is on you.

00:05:23.239 --> 00:05:24.491 position:50% align:center
[TWICE]
And, they're off.

00:05:24.574 --> 00:05:26.117 position:50% align:center
Our best plan of action would be

00:05:26.201 --> 00:05:29.037 position:50% align:center
to make a break
for it immediately.

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:31.956 position:50% align:center
What should we do,
Toga? Kiss maybe?

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:34.626 position:50% align:center
There's a good chance Izuku's
gonna get bloodied up.

00:05:34.709 --> 00:05:37.045 position:50% align:center
I'd really like
to see that again.

00:05:37.128 --> 00:05:41.091 position:50% align:center
But, maybe more than that...

00:05:41.174 --> 00:05:43.009 position:50% align:center
Right now I just
wanna make Overhaul

00:05:43.093 --> 00:05:45.011 position:50% align:center
cry like a little baby.

00:05:45.095 --> 00:05:47.931 position:50% align:center
[TWICE] In that case,
I've got no idea!

00:05:48.014 --> 00:05:49.349 position:50% align:center
Here's what we should do.

00:05:49.432 --> 00:05:50.809 position:50% align:center
[TOGA]
I'm listening.

00:05:50.892 --> 00:05:53.812 position:50% align:center
[TWICE whipering]

00:05:56.064 --> 00:05:57.982 position:50% align:center
Oh, that's perfect, Jin.

00:05:58.066 --> 00:06:00.985 position:50% align:center
It'll make Tomura
real happy, too!

00:06:01.069 --> 00:06:03.988 position:50% align:center
If Izuku's group and
Overhaul come together,

00:06:04.072 --> 00:06:07.283 position:50% align:center
everybody's gonna end up
bruised and bleeding.

00:06:07.367 --> 00:06:09.327 position:50% align:center
The fight between the
heroes and the yakuza

00:06:09.411 --> 00:06:12.330 position:50% align:center
will be epic! I bet at
the end of the battle,

00:06:12.414 --> 00:06:14.833 position:50% align:center
both sides'll be
super messed up.

00:06:14.916 --> 00:06:17.127 position:50% align:center
Ooh, I wish I could watch!

00:06:22.924 --> 00:06:24.843 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
No matter what...

00:06:31.182 --> 00:06:32.726 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
I'll save her!

00:06:40.859 --> 00:06:42.318 position:50% align:center
[CHISAKI groans]

00:06:43.653 --> 00:06:44.571 position:50% align:center
[AIZAWA]
Got him.

00:06:44.654 --> 00:06:45.697 position:50% align:center
Nighteye, quick!

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:48.658 position:50% align:center
Secure those who've
been injured.

[SIR NIGHTEYE]
Two of Chisaki's inner circle!

00:06:50.452 --> 00:06:53.455 position:50% align:center
We passed another
on the way here.

00:06:53.538 --> 00:06:55.290 position:50% align:center
Chisaki's on his last legs.

00:06:55.373 --> 00:06:58.710 position:50% align:center
But he's completely
sealed up the room.

00:06:58.793 --> 00:07:00.086 position:50% align:center
Mirio!

00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:04.341 position:50% align:center
Get Eri out of here
 She's behind me.

00:07:08.261 --> 00:07:12.432 position:50% align:center
Rest. I've got you now.

00:07:12.515 --> 00:07:18.021 position:50% align:center
You were amazing.
You found her, Mirio.

00:07:20.523 --> 00:07:22.734 position:50% align:center
[CHISAKI]
He took away my power!

00:07:22.817 --> 00:07:25.195 position:50% align:center
Lemillion already has him
backed into a corner.

00:07:25.278 --> 00:07:26.738 position:50% align:center
It's up to us to finish this.

00:07:26.821 --> 00:07:27.864 position:50% align:center
Yes, sir!

00:07:27.947 --> 00:07:31.201 position:50% align:center

[KURONO]
Those pierced by the long hand

00:07:40.502 --> 00:07:42.671 position:50% align:center
will find their
movements slowed.

00:07:42.754 --> 00:07:44.839 position:50% align:center
I meant to skewer
both of you at once,

00:07:44.923 --> 00:07:47.550 position:50% align:center
but, then, that's
heroes for ya.

00:07:47.634 --> 00:07:50.970 position:50% align:center
[CHISAKI] It took him
long enough to wake up.

00:07:51.054 --> 00:07:54.057 position:50% align:center
That schoolboy managed
to take Chrono out.

00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:56.643 position:50% align:center
But I repaired his head
and healed the damage

00:07:56.726 --> 00:08:00.146 position:50% align:center
while the kid was distracted!

00:08:00.230 --> 00:08:03.900 position:50% align:center
[AIZAWA] No. I can't
stop myself from blinking.

00:08:03.983 --> 00:08:05.402 position:50% align:center
I've got you!

00:08:05.485 --> 00:08:07.153 position:50% align:center
[CHISAKI]
Everything...

00:08:07.237 --> 00:08:08.363 position:50% align:center
[AIZAWA grunts]

00:08:08.446 --> 00:08:11.116 position:50% align:center
[CHISAKI]
All you've done...

00:08:11.199 --> 00:08:12.701 position:50% align:center
...has been for nothing!

00:08:12.784 --> 00:08:14.119 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:08:16.579 --> 00:08:18.415 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU yells]

00:08:21.584 --> 00:08:23.837 position:50% align:center
[CHISAKI]
As if I'd let my plans be ruined

00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:27.090 position:50% align:center
by people like you who
are sick in the head.

00:08:27.173 --> 00:08:28.800 position:50% align:center
You get it, Nemoto.

00:08:28.883 --> 00:08:32.053 position:50% align:center
You want me to succeed.

00:08:32.137 --> 00:08:35.807 position:50% align:center
I won't allow all my
hard work to end here.

00:08:35.890 --> 00:08:38.226 position:50% align:center
You've always been
eager to help.

00:08:38.309 --> 00:08:40.478 position:50% align:center
So I know you'll
happily give your life

00:08:40.562 --> 00:08:43.690 position:50% align:center
for my cause, won't you?

00:08:48.695 --> 00:08:51.072 position:50% align:center
[CHISAKI] I'll be a good
sport and acknowledge

00:08:51.156 --> 00:08:53.533 position:50% align:center
you were stronger
than me, Lemillion.

00:08:53.616 --> 00:08:56.578 position:50% align:center
I respect your perseverance.

00:08:56.661 --> 00:09:01.708 position:50% align:center
But in the end, I will
still be the victor.

00:09:01.791 --> 00:09:07.213 position:50% align:center
Now, heroes. I'll have
you return Eri to me!

00:09:17.265 --> 00:09:18.767 position:50% align:center
[KURONO] We referenced
your Quirk quite a bit

00:09:18.850 --> 00:09:21.061 position:50% align:center
while conducting our
research on Eri.

00:09:21.144 --> 00:09:24.314 position:50% align:center
So I know a great deal
about you, Erasure Hero.

00:09:24.397 --> 00:09:27.025 position:50% align:center
Fortunately I was able to
isolate you from your friends

00:09:27.108 --> 00:09:30.945 position:50% align:center
without resorting
to lethal force.

00:09:31.029 --> 00:09:34.616 position:50% align:center
You'll be much more
useful to us alive.

00:09:34.699 --> 00:09:36.242 position:50% align:center
Erasing Quirks.

00:09:36.326 --> 00:09:39.662 position:50% align:center
That's an ability Overhaul
finds very appealing.

00:09:39.746 --> 00:09:42.290 position:50% align:center
Oh, stop struggling.
It's no use.

00:09:42.374 --> 00:09:44.751 position:50% align:center
You have all the speed
of a snail right now.

00:09:44.834 --> 00:09:47.337 position:50% align:center
Give up. I struck you
with the short hand.

00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:49.673 position:50% align:center
You won't move normally
for another hour.

00:09:49.756 --> 00:09:51.216 position:50% align:center
[PRESENT MIC] One of
Hassaikai's Eight Bullets

00:09:51.299 --> 00:09:53.426 position:50% align:center
and aide to the young
head: Hari Kurono.

00:09:53.510 --> 00:09:54.886 position:50% align:center
Quirk: Chronostasis.

00:09:54.969 --> 00:09:56.805 position:50% align:center
His hair resembles
the hands of a clock.

00:09:56.888 --> 00:09:58.473 position:50% align:center
One slice from
a strand will slow

00:09:58.556 --> 00:10:01.267 position:50% align:center
his target's movements
to a crawl.

00:10:01.351 --> 00:10:02.394 position:50% align:center
[KURONO]
There's no stopping him

00:10:02.477 --> 00:10:06.481 position:50% align:center
once he's set his
mind to something.

00:10:06.564 --> 00:10:08.066 position:50% align:center
I don't know how much
you've been able

00:10:08.149 --> 00:10:12.362 position:50% align:center
to find out, but Eri is the
Hassaikai boss's granddaughter.

00:10:12.445 --> 00:10:14.823 position:50% align:center
If it brings Overhaul closer
to achieving his goal,

00:10:14.906 --> 00:10:17.659 position:50% align:center
nothing is off-limits.

00:10:17.742 --> 00:10:20.203 position:50% align:center
He will use anything and anyone.

00:10:20.286 --> 00:10:22.622 position:50% align:center
That's the kind of man he is.

00:10:22.706 --> 00:10:25.000 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] He destroyed
himself and his underling,

00:10:25.083 --> 00:10:26.960 position:50% align:center
and then fused them together?

00:10:27.043 --> 00:10:30.046 position:50% align:center
[CHISAKI] That was
unpleasant but necessary,

00:10:30.130 --> 00:10:32.674 position:50% align:center
and I feel much better now.

00:10:32.757 --> 00:10:35.260 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Take stock of the situation.

00:10:35.343 --> 00:10:39.222 position:50% align:center
Nighteye's over there,
protecting Eri and Togata.

00:10:39.305 --> 00:10:40.974 position:50% align:center
No sign of Mr. Aizawa.

00:10:41.057 --> 00:10:43.768 position:50% align:center
Or the guy in the white hood.

00:10:43.852 --> 00:10:46.813 position:50% align:center
Then there's Chisaki,
who merged with that other guy,

00:10:46.896 --> 00:10:50.275 position:50% align:center
and seems to've healed
himself in the process.

00:10:50.358 --> 00:10:53.278 position:50% align:center
[CHISAKI] Cleanliness
is an obsession of mine.

00:10:53.361 --> 00:10:55.905 position:50% align:center
When someone contaminates
me with their filth,

00:10:55.989 --> 00:10:57.490 position:50% align:center
I lose control.

00:10:57.574 --> 00:11:00.618 position:50% align:center
It's never gone quite
this far before, though.

00:11:00.702 --> 00:11:03.747 position:50% align:center
What an unfortunate
turn for you, Lemillion.

00:11:03.830 --> 00:11:07.459 position:50% align:center
You chose to get involved
with Eri, with me.

00:11:07.542 --> 00:11:11.880 position:50% align:center
And now your Quirk
is lost forever.

00:11:11.963 --> 00:11:13.923 position:50% align:center
[SIR NIGHTEYE]
He lost his Quirk?

00:11:14.007 --> 00:11:16.051 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
It's gone forever?

00:11:16.134 --> 00:11:19.137 position:50% align:center
[CHISAKI] If you'd only
backed down sooner,

00:11:19.220 --> 00:11:22.557 position:50% align:center
you could have held on
to your pathetic dreams.

00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:25.435 position:50% align:center
But instead you fought,
refusing to give up

00:11:25.518 --> 00:11:27.645 position:50% align:center
even after your Quirk was gone.

00:11:27.729 --> 00:11:30.023 position:50% align:center
And now, thanks to your heroics,

00:11:30.106 --> 00:11:32.567 position:50% align:center
your friends will
die along with you!

00:11:35.362 --> 00:11:38.615 position:50% align:center
[MIRIO] He can use his Quirk
with someone else's hands?

00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:44.287 position:50% align:center
[CHISAKI gasps]

00:11:44.371 --> 00:11:46.414 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Leave them alone!

00:11:53.505 --> 00:11:55.006 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
I can't read his movements!

00:11:55.090 --> 00:11:57.676 position:50% align:center
The iron soles in my boots
are the only reason I'm alive.

00:11:57.759 --> 00:12:01.221 position:50% align:center
[CHISAKI] Power and speed.
That's all you've got.

00:12:03.390 --> 00:12:05.183 position:50% align:center
Stand down, Deku.
I'll deal with him.

00:12:05.266 --> 00:12:06.601 position:50% align:center
[CHISAKI]
Will you now?

00:12:06.685 --> 00:12:08.645 position:50% align:center
[SIR NIGHTEYE] Limit his
moves and get in close.

00:12:08.728 --> 00:12:11.189 position:50% align:center
Don't let him
transform the ground.

00:12:11.272 --> 00:12:13.316 position:50% align:center
You look out for
Lemillion and Eri!

00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:14.567 position:50% align:center
Understood, sir!

00:12:14.651 --> 00:12:16.361 position:50% align:center
What happened to Eraser Head?

00:12:16.444 --> 00:12:18.196 position:50% align:center
Did your lackey
take him somewhere?

00:12:18.279 --> 00:12:21.074 position:50% align:center
[CHISAKI] I'm interested in
heroes who can erase Quirks,

00:12:21.157 --> 00:12:23.660 position:50% align:center
so he's been shown
to the VIP room.

00:12:23.743 --> 00:12:26.871 position:50% align:center
You destroy other people's
Quirks so cavalierly,

00:12:26.955 --> 00:12:29.958 position:50% align:center
but when the tables are turned,
it frightens you.

00:12:30.041 --> 00:12:32.085 position:50% align:center
If Lemillion's Quirk
is “lost forever,”

00:12:32.168 --> 00:12:33.712 position:50% align:center
does that mean you
perfected the bullets

00:12:33.795 --> 00:12:35.839 position:50% align:center
and used one on him?

00:12:35.922 --> 00:12:37.298 position:50% align:center
You deployed your prized weapon

00:12:37.382 --> 00:12:40.301 position:50% align:center
instead of sneaking
it off to safety.

00:12:40.385 --> 00:12:43.179 position:50% align:center
Were you that frightened
of my protégé?

00:12:49.686 --> 00:12:51.980 position:50% align:center
[SIR NIGHTEYE] When you fight,
watch your opponent.

00:12:52.063 --> 00:12:53.982 position:50% align:center
Predict his next move.

00:12:54.065 --> 00:12:56.234 position:50% align:center
But, Sir, my Quirk
isn't like Foresight.

00:12:56.317 --> 00:12:57.360 position:50% align:center
I can't just predict what

00:12:57.444 --> 00:12:59.154 position:50% align:center
somebody's gonna
do in the future.

00:12:59.237 --> 00:13:01.698 position:50% align:center
Thank you for that
amusing answer.

00:13:01.781 --> 00:13:03.742 position:50% align:center
But you can still store
up your experiences

00:13:03.825 --> 00:13:06.995 position:50% align:center
with new situations.
Rescue. Combat.

00:13:07.078 --> 00:13:08.621 position:50% align:center
Hardship and suffering.

00:13:08.705 --> 00:13:11.458 position:50% align:center
Those will become your database.

00:13:11.541 --> 00:13:13.960 position:50% align:center
I think I understand. Sir.

00:13:16.421 --> 00:13:21.843 position:50% align:center
[SIR NIGHTEYE]
Mirio. You believed in me.

00:13:21.926 --> 00:13:24.179 position:50% align:center
You believed in my
teaching and used it

00:13:24.262 --> 00:13:30.101 position:50% align:center
to become strong.
I'm proud of you.

00:13:30.185 --> 00:13:32.520 position:50% align:center
If only I could see it.

00:13:32.604 --> 00:13:34.981 position:50% align:center
Your success, and
the safety of those

00:13:35.065 --> 00:13:37.984 position:50% align:center
you're fighting to protect.

00:13:38.068 --> 00:13:39.944 position:50% align:center
You saw it didn't you?

00:13:40.028 --> 00:13:42.947 position:50% align:center
I told you not to use
your Foresight on me.

00:13:45.075 --> 00:13:46.743 position:50% align:center
[GRAN TORINO]
Why do you fear it?

00:13:46.826 --> 00:13:49.454 position:50% align:center
Seeing things farther
into the future?

00:13:49.537 --> 00:13:51.790 position:50% align:center
[SIR NIGHTEYE] Because what
I see cannot be changed.

00:13:51.873 --> 00:13:54.167 position:50% align:center
I've tested many times.

00:13:54.250 --> 00:13:57.545 position:50% align:center
Even if my actions are different
than in the future I saw,

00:13:57.629 --> 00:13:59.214 position:50% align:center
the timeline always
rights itself,

00:13:59.297 --> 00:14:02.008 position:50% align:center
as if the accounts are
being balanced somehow.

00:14:02.092 --> 00:14:05.929 position:50% align:center
The future never diverges
from what I've seen.

00:14:06.012 --> 00:14:08.014 position:50% align:center
What if, by using my
Foresight on a person,

00:14:08.098 --> 00:14:11.017 position:50% align:center
I'm somehow dictating the
course their life will take?

00:14:11.101 --> 00:14:13.937 position:50% align:center
I can't help but think, if I
hadn't used it on All Might,

00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:15.814 position:50% align:center
is there even a chance
that his future

00:14:15.897 --> 00:14:17.941 position:50% align:center
could turn out differently?

00:14:18.024 --> 00:14:22.612 position:50% align:center
Is he going to die
because of me?

00:14:25.281 --> 00:14:27.826 position:50% align:center
You're thinking too much.

00:14:27.909 --> 00:14:33.206 position:50% align:center
[SIR NIGHTEYE] Perhaps.
But even so, I won't do it.

00:14:33.289 --> 00:14:37.627 position:50% align:center
I will never view anyone
else's distant future again.

00:14:43.466 --> 00:14:45.593 position:50% align:center
[SIR NIGHTEYE]
I don't have to look far.

00:14:45.677 --> 00:14:48.847 position:50% align:center
Just repeated
one-second glances.

00:14:48.930 --> 00:14:52.142 position:50% align:center
I'll use those to guide me

00:14:52.225 --> 00:14:55.979 position:50% align:center
to the future that
Mirio fought for!

00:14:56.062 --> 00:14:57.439 position:50% align:center
[NIGHTEYE gasps]

00:14:59.733 --> 00:15:02.694 position:50% align:center
Lemillion! Eri! How
badly are you injured?

00:15:02.777 --> 00:15:04.529 position:50% align:center
Do you think you can walk?

00:15:04.612 --> 00:15:09.868 position:50% align:center
[MIRIO]
Yeah. No problem. I'm fine.

00:15:09.951 --> 00:15:14.539 position:50% align:center
But I failed. You're sad
again and it's my fault.

00:15:14.622 --> 00:15:16.499 position:50% align:center
C'mon. Let's go.

00:15:19.711 --> 00:15:22.005 position:50% align:center
I'm pretty sure
this'll lead us back.

00:15:22.088 --> 00:15:23.673 position:50% align:center
We need to get
away from Chisaki!

00:15:23.757 --> 00:15:25.216 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:15:28.636 --> 00:15:30.305 position:50% align:center
[ERI]
No.

00:15:32.182 --> 00:15:33.892 position:50% align:center
[ERI]
That's enough.

00:15:33.975 --> 00:15:38.146 position:50% align:center
[CHISAKI] Every action you take
results in people dying.

00:15:38.229 --> 00:15:41.024 position:50% align:center
You're a cursed human.

00:15:41.107 --> 00:15:43.234 position:50% align:center
I'm so sorry.

00:15:48.782 --> 00:15:50.241 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:15:51.993 --> 00:15:53.703 position:50% align:center
Sir?

00:15:59.209 --> 00:16:01.836 position:50% align:center
[MIRIO]
No!

00:16:07.467 --> 00:16:10.011 position:50% align:center
[SIR NIGHTEYE]
Let me see it.

00:16:10.095 --> 00:16:12.597 position:50% align:center
A future in which
the boys escape,

00:16:12.681 --> 00:16:16.184 position:50% align:center
and take Eri to safety.

00:16:16.267 --> 00:16:18.728 position:50% align:center
Let me see it!

00:16:36.830 --> 00:16:39.332 position:50% align:center
[CHISAKI]
He seems much more powerful now.

00:16:39.416 --> 00:16:42.502 position:50% align:center
Was he only fighting
at half-strength before?

00:16:42.585 --> 00:16:45.255 position:50% align:center
Take her! Get Eri to safety!

00:16:46.423 --> 00:16:48.633 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
My whole body's screaming at me.

00:16:48.717 --> 00:16:50.885 position:50% align:center
But, I can move.

00:16:50.969 --> 00:16:52.637 position:50% align:center
My arms and legs are aching,

00:16:52.721 --> 00:16:55.181 position:50% align:center
and I can't keep
this up for long.

00:16:55.265 --> 00:16:57.684 position:50% align:center
But I can still move!

00:16:57.767 --> 00:17:00.854 position:50% align:center
One For All 20 Percent!

00:17:00.937 --> 00:17:01.980 position:50% align:center
[CHISAKI]
Give up.

00:17:02.063 --> 00:17:04.024 position:50% align:center
I've already told
you how this ends.

00:17:04.107 --> 00:17:05.775 position:50% align:center
You're all going to die!

00:17:05.859 --> 00:17:08.862 position:50% align:center
You're wrong. I won't
let that happen!

00:17:08.945 --> 00:17:11.322 position:50% align:center
Even if it's already
been decided.

00:17:11.406 --> 00:17:15.535 position:50% align:center
Even if it's set in stone.
I'll smash that future!

00:17:15.618 --> 00:17:17.370 position:50% align:center
[CHISAKI]
You little brat!

00:17:20.123 --> 00:17:22.584 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] I'm getting better
at anticipating his attacks,

00:17:22.667 --> 00:17:24.210 position:50% align:center
but I can't dodge forever.

00:17:24.294 --> 00:17:25.462 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU grunts]

00:17:28.298 --> 00:17:31.551 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] I have to hold out!
A little longer!

00:17:31.634 --> 00:17:33.762 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] Chisaki's
not going to back down.

00:17:33.845 --> 00:17:36.431 position:50% align:center
He'll die before giving Eri up.

00:17:38.016 --> 00:17:39.809 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
I have to do this quickly.

00:17:39.893 --> 00:17:42.896 position:50% align:center
If I injure him,
he'll just repair himself.

00:17:42.979 --> 00:17:46.107 position:50% align:center
Win with one blow!

00:17:46.191 --> 00:17:52.614 position:50% align:center
One strike to the head!
Manchester Smash!

00:17:58.161 --> 00:17:59.662 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
He dodged!

00:17:59.746 --> 00:18:02.916 position:50% align:center
[CHISAKI] You may be fast,
but compared to the last two,

00:18:02.999 --> 00:18:07.295 position:50% align:center
the lines of your movements
are painfully easy to predict.

00:18:07.379 --> 00:18:09.172 position:50% align:center
[groans]

00:18:13.843 --> 00:18:16.179 position:50% align:center
[MIRIO grunting]

00:18:16.262 --> 00:18:18.390 position:50% align:center
[MIRIO] I need to get
her away from here.

00:18:18.473 --> 00:18:20.975 position:50% align:center
To someplace safe.

00:18:21.059 --> 00:18:26.773 position:50% align:center
No problem. "Power," right?
I can keep going.

00:18:30.151 --> 00:18:34.322 position:50% align:center
[MIRIO]
Move. Move, Lemillion!

[grunts]

00:18:40.120 --> 00:18:47.961 position:50% align:center
[MIRIO]
Get up. Get back up! And move!

00:18:48.044 --> 00:18:53.800 position:50% align:center
[MIRIO] Go, Eri. Find somewhere
to hide. Wait for help.

00:18:53.883 --> 00:18:58.763 position:50% align:center
Dozens of people are
doing everything they can

00:18:58.847 --> 00:19:03.643 position:50% align:center
to save you. Just hide.
It's all good.

00:19:03.727 --> 00:19:10.275 position:50% align:center
You're gonna be fine.
Okay? Just go.

00:19:10.358 --> 00:19:13.069 position:50% align:center
[CHISAKI] Being able to put
myself back together again

00:19:13.153 --> 00:19:17.532 position:50% align:center
doesn't make breaking
apart hurt any less.

00:19:17.615 --> 00:19:20.118 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] If the ground
hadn't cracked into pieces,

00:19:20.201 --> 00:19:23.913 position:50% align:center
he would've skewered me
with a massive spike!

00:19:23.997 --> 00:19:26.291 position:50% align:center
[CHISAKI]
You're done, kid.

00:19:26.374 --> 00:19:29.169 position:50% align:center
No way. It's not over.

00:19:29.252 --> 00:19:30.962 position:50% align:center
[CHISAKI]
Just like your friend.

00:19:31.046 --> 00:19:33.089 position:50% align:center
He didn't know when
to give up, either.

00:19:33.173 --> 00:19:34.507 position:50% align:center
Though there's
something to be said

00:19:34.591 --> 00:19:38.345 position:50% align:center
for a person who refuses
to admit defeat.

00:19:38.428 --> 00:19:41.222 position:50% align:center
Someone else is about
to die because of you!

00:19:41.306 --> 00:19:42.432 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:19:42.515 --> 00:19:46.686 position:50% align:center
[CHISAKI] Is that really
what you want? Eri!

00:19:49.147 --> 00:19:51.107 position:50% align:center
[KURONO] It looks like
she's at her limit.

00:19:51.191 --> 00:19:53.485 position:50% align:center
She's used up all her strength.

00:19:53.568 --> 00:19:54.736 position:50% align:center
[CHISAKI]
Fine, then.

00:19:54.819 --> 00:19:58.198 position:50% align:center
I suppose it's about
time for a reset.

00:19:58.281 --> 00:20:00.617 position:50% align:center
Let's go back to square one.

00:20:01.993 --> 00:20:03.828 position:50% align:center
[ERI]
No.

00:20:07.332 --> 00:20:08.583 position:50% align:center
[ERI]
Wait.

00:20:08.667 --> 00:20:10.752 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:20:10.835 --> 00:20:16.132 position:50% align:center
[ERI]
It's not... I don't want this!

00:20:16.216 --> 00:20:17.175 position:50% align:center
Go back!

00:20:17.258 --> 00:20:20.679 position:50% align:center
You need to stay
with Lemillion, Eri!

00:20:20.762 --> 00:20:22.597 position:50% align:center
[CHISAKI]
Eri.

00:20:22.681 --> 00:20:24.599 position:50% align:center
Look at him, injured and alone.

00:20:24.683 --> 00:20:29.312 position:50% align:center
You don't really think
he can defeat me, do you?

00:20:29.396 --> 00:20:31.773 position:50% align:center
No, I don't.

00:20:31.856 --> 00:20:32.982 position:50% align:center
Smart girl.

00:20:33.066 --> 00:20:36.486 position:50% align:center
So then, what do you
suppose you should do?

00:20:36.569 --> 00:20:38.238 position:50% align:center
I'll come back.

00:20:38.321 --> 00:20:40.907 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Eri.

00:20:40.990 --> 00:20:44.577 position:50% align:center
But if I do,

00:20:44.661 --> 00:20:48.331 position:50% align:center
I want you to make them
all better again!

00:20:48.415 --> 00:20:52.002 position:50% align:center
[CHISAKI] Ah, yes, it's so much
easier to be hurt yourself

00:20:52.085 --> 00:20:55.505 position:50% align:center
than to watch while others
are hurt for you, isn't it?

00:20:55.588 --> 00:20:58.216 position:50% align:center
The faint flicker of hope
Lemillion gave her

00:20:58.299 --> 00:21:01.302 position:50% align:center
has been extinguished.
Don't you see?

00:21:01.386 --> 00:21:03.054 position:50% align:center
You think you're helping her,

00:21:03.138 --> 00:21:06.474 position:50% align:center
but you're really
just being cruel.

00:21:06.558 --> 00:21:10.145 position:50% align:center
She doesn't want you.

00:21:12.355 --> 00:21:19.946 position:50% align:center
[SIR NIGHTEYE] Midoriya.
It's no use. You can't save Eri.

00:21:20.030 --> 00:21:23.616 position:50% align:center
I've seen it. I saw the future.

00:21:23.700 --> 00:21:28.455 position:50% align:center
You and I die,
and Chisaki gets away.

00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:33.626 position:50% align:center
Maybe what he said is true.

00:21:33.710 --> 00:21:36.421 position:50% align:center
Maybe you think you
don't want my help,

00:21:36.504 --> 00:21:41.343 position:50% align:center
but I won't let you down, Eri.

00:21:41.426 --> 00:21:44.262 position:50% align:center
I'm not letting anyone die!

00:21:44.346 --> 00:21:46.723 position:50% align:center
I'm going to save you!

00:21:53.855 --> 00:21:55.857 position:50% align:center
--[CHISAKI grunts]

00:23:29.325 --> 00:23:30.744 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Here's the preview!

00:23:30.827 --> 00:23:33.204 position:50% align:center
Now that I've gotten
hold of Eri's hand.

00:23:33.288 --> 00:23:35.457 position:50% align:center
I'm not letting go again.

00:23:35.540 --> 00:23:37.000 position:50% align:center
I don't care what
horrible future

00:23:37.083 --> 00:23:38.877 position:50% align:center
Nighteye's Foresight showed him.

00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:40.754 position:50% align:center
I'm not going to give up!

00:23:40.837 --> 00:23:43.548 position:50% align:center
Come on. One For All!

00:23:43.631 --> 00:23:45.842 position:50% align:center
This power was created
by voices crying out

00:23:45.925 --> 00:23:48.511 position:50% align:center
for help and the brave
hearts that answered them.

00:23:48.595 --> 00:23:50.221 position:50% align:center
It's time to release it!

00:23:50.305 --> 00:23:53.433 position:50% align:center
Next time, “Infinite
One Hundred Percent.”

00:23:53.516 --> 00:23:55.935 position:50% align:center
Break through your limits,
Izuku Midoriya!

00:23:56.019 --> 00:23:58.355 position:50% align:center
Go beyond! Plus Ultra!
