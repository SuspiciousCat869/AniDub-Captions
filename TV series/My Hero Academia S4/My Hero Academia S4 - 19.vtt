[AIZAWA]
It's coming.

00:00:10.885 --> 00:00:13.138 position:50% align:center
The school festival.

00:00:13.221 --> 00:00:15.807 position:50% align:center
[STUDENTS]
Normal school stuff!

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:17.809 position:50% align:center
But your class still needs
to participate with

00:00:17.892 --> 00:00:20.520 position:50% align:center
some kind of
original programming.

00:00:20.603 --> 00:00:23.231 position:50% align:center
[TENYA] Interesting.
Singing and dancing, huh?

00:00:23.314 --> 00:00:25.108 position:50% align:center
[HAGAKURE] Well, if we're
talking about music...

00:00:25.191 --> 00:00:26.985 position:50% align:center
[JIRO gasps]

00:00:27.068 --> 00:00:29.612 position:50% align:center
[JIRO]
Uh... What?

00:00:29.696 --> 00:00:31.364 position:50% align:center
You can play so
many instruments!

00:00:31.448 --> 00:00:33.241 position:50% align:center
You're freakin' awesome!

00:00:33.324 --> 00:00:36.494 position:50% align:center
Well, after what
you've all said...

00:00:36.578 --> 00:00:38.830 position:50% align:center
If I didn't do it,

00:00:38.913 --> 00:00:41.666 position:50% align:center
it wouldn't be rockin' at all.

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:43.543 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Mr. Aizawa!

00:00:43.626 --> 00:00:45.670 position:50% align:center
Do you think Eri could
leave the hospital?

00:00:45.754 --> 00:00:47.380 position:50% align:center
Just for one day, I mean.

00:00:47.464 --> 00:00:49.132 position:50% align:center
Please say yes.

00:00:49.215 --> 00:00:51.509 position:50% align:center
Let her go to the UA Festival.

00:02:24.936 --> 00:02:26.813 position:50% align:center
[music plays]

00:02:26.896 --> 00:02:29.232 position:50% align:center
[GENTLE] All Might,
the Symbol of Peace.

00:02:29.315 --> 00:02:31.985 position:50% align:center
His is a face known
'round the world.

00:02:32.068 --> 00:02:36.281 position:50% align:center
Like this virile vigilante, many
a hero will no doubt be recorded

00:02:36.364 --> 00:02:40.160 position:50% align:center
in the history books thanks
to their notable exploits.

00:02:40.243 --> 00:02:43.455 position:50% align:center
Of course, one must not forget
the legendary All For One.

00:02:43.538 --> 00:02:46.332 position:50% align:center
Destro, the commander of
the Meta Liberation Army,

00:02:46.416 --> 00:02:49.377 position:50% align:center
and the peerless
thief, Oji Harima.

00:02:49.461 --> 00:02:52.255 position:50% align:center
These so-called villains
have likewise found

00:02:52.339 --> 00:02:55.967 position:50% align:center
a notoriety that will ensure
their names are never forgotten.

00:02:56.051 --> 00:02:58.845 position:50% align:center
Before the legislative system
of superhuman society

00:02:58.928 --> 00:03:02.223 position:50% align:center
worked in absolutes--back when
the distinction between "hero"

00:03:02.307 --> 00:03:05.435 position:50% align:center
and "villain" was still
vague--there was chaos.

00:03:05.518 --> 00:03:07.562 position:50% align:center
But there was freedom.

00:03:07.645 --> 00:03:09.147 position:50% align:center
That's right.

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:13.360 position:50% align:center
It was a raw, unfettered freedom
not unlike that of the Anglaise!

00:03:13.443 --> 00:03:15.487 position:50% align:center
Lovely to see you,
dear viewers.

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:18.531 position:50% align:center
May I delight you with
a smashing new adventure?

00:03:18.615 --> 00:03:20.700 position:50% align:center
Yes! 'Tis I, Gentle!

00:03:20.784 --> 00:03:23.036 position:50% align:center
Gentle Criminal,
at your service!

00:03:23.119 --> 00:03:25.955 position:50% align:center
[LA BRAVA squeals]
So good!

00:03:26.039 --> 00:03:28.166 position:50% align:center
That was wonderful, my Gentle!

00:03:28.249 --> 00:03:30.877 position:50% align:center
Oh! You couldn't
be more talented!

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:32.629 position:50% align:center
[LA BRAVA laughing]

00:03:32.712 --> 00:03:35.882 position:50% align:center
[GENTLE] La Brava, has
the upload been completed?

00:03:35.965 --> 00:03:37.509 position:50% align:center
Yep! You bet it has!

00:03:37.592 --> 00:03:39.177 position:50% align:center
The account was deleted again,

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.054 position:50% align:center
but don't worry,
I reuploaded everything,

00:03:41.137 --> 00:03:42.847 position:50% align:center
starting with your debut video!

00:03:42.931 --> 00:03:45.266 position:50% align:center
You remember that one?
It had me swooning.

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:47.018 position:50% align:center
More exhilarating
than a cup of coffee.

00:03:47.102 --> 00:03:50.772 position:50% align:center
[laughs] I'd expect nothing
less from you, dear girl.

00:03:50.855 --> 00:03:53.149 position:50% align:center
Exceptional work,
as alwa-- Ouch!

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:56.861 position:50% align:center
Right, then.

00:03:56.945 --> 00:03:59.280 position:50% align:center
Shall we discuss the finer
points of today's shoot?

00:03:59.364 --> 00:04:01.533 position:50% align:center
After finishing this cup,

00:04:01.616 --> 00:04:04.744 position:50% align:center
elegantly savoring
each and every sip.

00:04:04.828 --> 00:04:08.248 position:50% align:center
[GENTLE]
'Tis I, Gentle! Gentle Criminal!

00:04:08.331 --> 00:04:10.709 position:50% align:center
I upload cinematic
snapshots of deeds

00:04:10.792 --> 00:04:13.420 position:50% align:center
that some would
consider heinous.

00:04:13.503 --> 00:04:15.839 position:50% align:center
But, my darlings, do not
jump to conclusions.

00:04:15.922 --> 00:04:18.925 position:50% align:center
I am not committing
crimes at random.

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:21.720 position:50% align:center
For example, I recently
robbed J-Store,

00:04:21.803 --> 00:04:24.264 position:50% align:center
the largest convenience
store chain in the nation.

00:04:24.347 --> 00:04:26.558 position:50% align:center
A veritable corporate behemoth.

00:04:26.641 --> 00:04:28.977 position:50% align:center
Their best-selling item
is Fluffy Pudding.

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:30.228 position:50% align:center
But hark, viewers!

00:04:30.311 --> 00:04:32.772 position:50% align:center
This maniacal market is
suspected of mislabeling

00:04:32.856 --> 00:04:35.775 position:50% align:center
said dessert and forging
its expiration date!

00:04:35.859 --> 00:04:38.737 position:50% align:center
Naturally, the company feigned
ignorance, and it began to look

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:42.615 position:50% align:center
as though no one would be
punished for these deeds.

00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:44.492 position:50% align:center
Catching on, my loves?

00:04:44.576 --> 00:04:48.621 position:50% align:center
Yes! I reprimand those who
behave in an ungentlemanly way.

00:04:48.705 --> 00:04:51.791 position:50% align:center
I am the modern-day
"gentleman thief."

00:04:51.875 --> 00:04:53.626 position:50% align:center
Ugh, this is so frustrating!

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:55.545 position:50% align:center
Whatever do you mean, dear girl?

00:04:55.628 --> 00:04:57.756 position:50% align:center
The J-Store video should
be racking up views,

00:04:57.839 --> 00:04:59.007 position:50% align:center
but it's barely being watched!

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:00.967 position:50% align:center
People on the internet
have no taste!

00:05:01.051 --> 00:05:03.178 position:50% align:center
Someone as charming as
you are should go viral!

00:05:03.261 --> 00:05:05.013 position:50% align:center
[laughing]

00:05:05.096 --> 00:05:07.390 position:50% align:center
If you always blame others,
then you will never live up

00:05:07.474 --> 00:05:09.392 position:50% align:center
to your fullest
potential, La Brava.

00:05:09.476 --> 00:05:10.852 position:50% align:center
But it just isn't fair!

00:05:10.935 --> 00:05:12.854 position:50% align:center
You've been putting out
villainous internet videos

00:05:12.937 --> 00:05:15.523 position:50% align:center
for a good six years now, and
what've you got to show for it?

00:05:15.607 --> 00:05:16.858 position:50% align:center
Nothing!

00:05:16.941 --> 00:05:19.110 position:50% align:center
Then, suddenly, this Stain
guy steals all the glory

00:05:19.194 --> 00:05:21.363 position:50% align:center
with a video of his
stupid life story!

00:05:21.446 --> 00:05:23.698 position:50% align:center
And he didn't even upload
the darn thing himself!

00:05:23.782 --> 00:05:25.742 position:50% align:center
Now, when people mention
villains, they're talking about

00:05:25.825 --> 00:05:27.869 position:50% align:center
the League of Villains, and
they're mean and gloomy!

00:05:27.952 --> 00:05:29.454 position:50% align:center
Nothing like you!

00:05:29.537 --> 00:05:31.706 position:50% align:center
You are absolutely correct.

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:34.501 position:50% align:center
Extreme and violent actions
do seem to fascinate

00:05:34.584 --> 00:05:39.255 position:50% align:center
the barbaric masses. It goes
against the fiber of my being.

00:05:39.339 --> 00:05:40.882 position:50% align:center
However...

00:05:46.596 --> 00:05:49.516 position:50% align:center
It's true that these foul
fiends have momentum.

00:05:49.599 --> 00:05:52.769 position:50% align:center
All of the videos concerning
them have over 10,000 comments

00:05:52.852 --> 00:05:55.313 position:50% align:center
of varying natures, while
the scant notes on my own

00:05:55.397 --> 00:05:57.190 position:50% align:center
videos are far from encouraging.

00:05:57.273 --> 00:05:59.526 position:50% align:center
[MAN 82A] His so-called
"exploits" are so lame.

00:05:59.609 --> 00:06:01.319 position:50% align:center
[MAN 82B] Doesn't look like
J-Store lost anything.

00:06:01.403 --> 00:06:02.904 position:50% align:center
[MAN 82C]
His crapiness stresses me out.

00:06:02.987 --> 00:06:04.280 position:50% align:center
[MAN 82D]
He should really ramp things up.

00:06:04.364 --> 00:06:05.740 position:50% align:center
[MAN 82E]
Show us La Brava!

00:06:05.824 --> 00:06:08.076 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:06:08.159 --> 00:06:10.704 position:50% align:center
But I refuse to be gutted by
these impertinent comments,

00:06:10.787 --> 00:06:13.039 position:50% align:center
La Brava! Why, do you ask?

00:06:13.123 --> 00:06:16.459 position:50% align:center
Because my next plan will
surpass all expectations!

00:06:16.543 --> 00:06:19.254 position:50% align:center
Ah! I never doubted you
for a second, Gentle!

00:06:19.337 --> 00:06:21.715 position:50% align:center
Let's hear it then,
what's your next plan?

00:06:21.798 --> 00:06:23.883 position:50% align:center
[GENTLE] Grand displays
and great works of art

00:06:23.967 --> 00:06:26.302 position:50% align:center
always question
the current times.

00:06:26.386 --> 00:06:28.388 position:50% align:center
I'll target the place
that's responsible

00:06:28.471 --> 00:06:32.642 position:50% align:center
for this age of heroes. Soon,
everyone will know my name.

00:06:37.022 --> 00:06:39.190 position:50% align:center
Still making up classes
from your work study?

00:06:39.274 --> 00:06:40.817 position:50% align:center
--[KIRISHIMA] Yeah!
--[IZUKU] Yes. Sorry.

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:42.569 position:50% align:center
Aw, there's no need
to apologize.

00:06:42.652 --> 00:06:45.405 position:50% align:center
We'll handle the school festival
prep while you catch up.

00:06:45.488 --> 00:06:47.115 position:50% align:center
We have, like, so many
decisions to make

00:06:47.198 --> 00:06:49.200 position:50% align:center
about costumes and choreography.

00:06:49.284 --> 00:06:50.243 position:50% align:center
[SHOJI]
What music do you think

00:06:50.326 --> 00:06:51.786 position:50% align:center
the rest of the
school would enjoy?

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:54.831 position:50% align:center
We should do whatever's
trendy. Right, Jiro?

00:06:54.914 --> 00:06:56.249 position:50% align:center
[JIRO]
Mm...

00:06:56.332 --> 00:06:57.584 position:50% align:center
[AGOYAMATO]
Hey, did ya hear?

00:06:57.667 --> 00:07:00.670 position:50% align:center
Class 1-A from the Hero
course is doing a concert.

00:07:00.754 --> 00:07:02.380 position:50% align:center
And it's for "us."

00:07:02.464 --> 00:07:03.548 position:50% align:center
[KATSUKI]
General studies.

00:07:03.631 --> 00:07:05.467 position:50% align:center
Oh, my god,
talk about egotistical.

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:07.010 position:50% align:center
Do they think we're,
like, dying to see them

00:07:07.093 --> 00:07:08.470 position:50% align:center
do some kind of
dumb performance?

00:07:08.553 --> 00:07:11.097 position:50% align:center
Well, yeah. We all
know they're clueless.

00:07:11.181 --> 00:07:13.850 position:50% align:center
What did they do after
getting attacked by villains?

00:07:13.933 --> 00:07:16.144 position:50% align:center
They went to a summer camp,
where, of course,

00:07:16.227 --> 00:07:19.522 position:50% align:center
they got attacked again.
We all know how that turned out.

00:07:19.606 --> 00:07:22.692 position:50% align:center
And we have to put up with the
repercussions of their stupidity

00:07:22.776 --> 00:07:24.986 position:50% align:center
even though it was their fault.

00:07:26.696 --> 00:07:29.032 position:50% align:center
[TENYA] The school festival
is one month away!

00:07:29.115 --> 00:07:30.241 position:50% align:center
We don't have much time.

00:07:30.325 --> 00:07:32.327 position:50% align:center
We should start making
decisions right now.

00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:34.287 position:50% align:center
[HAGAKURE] First, we need
to pick out a song, right?

00:07:34.371 --> 00:07:35.830 position:50% align:center
What should we do?

00:07:35.914 --> 00:07:37.499 position:50% align:center
I don't know much
about popular music,

00:07:37.582 --> 00:07:38.833 position:50% align:center
so I'll leave that
up to you guys.

00:07:38.917 --> 00:07:39.834 position:50% align:center
[SHOJI]
Same.

00:07:39.918 --> 00:07:41.086 position:50% align:center
If we're doing
this for everyone,

00:07:41.169 --> 00:07:42.629 position:50% align:center
shouldn't it be a song
that most people know

00:07:42.712 --> 00:07:44.673 position:50% align:center
so they could dance and
sing along with us?

00:07:44.756 --> 00:07:46.257 position:50% align:center
[SERO] It's gotta be
somethin' with a good beat!

00:07:46.341 --> 00:07:48.426 position:50% align:center
[ASHIDO]
Yeah! So we can get down!

00:07:48.510 --> 00:07:49.719 position:50% align:center
With those things in mind,

00:07:49.803 --> 00:07:51.388 position:50% align:center
I think I know what
would make sense.

00:07:51.471 --> 00:07:53.556 position:50% align:center
A hardcore four-on-
the-floor club song.

00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:55.558 position:50% align:center
It'll be like a
rave-meets-rock show.

00:07:55.642 --> 00:07:56.768 position:50% align:center
As for dance music,

00:07:56.851 --> 00:07:59.396 position:50% align:center
EDM would probably
be the most popular.

00:07:59.479 --> 00:08:01.731 position:50% align:center
But you guys wanna play
instruments, right?

00:08:01.815 --> 00:08:02.982 position:50% align:center
[SERO, OJIRO]
Huh?

00:08:03.066 --> 00:08:06.528 position:50% align:center
[JIRO] Anyone play bass
or drums or anything?

00:08:06.611 --> 00:08:11.116 position:50% align:center
Okay. Well, I'd say that drums
are the backbone of any band.

00:08:11.199 --> 00:08:13.660 position:50% align:center

Hold up! How's this for an idea?

00:12:10.730 --> 00:12:13.316 position:50% align:center
Uraraka makes Todoroki
and Kirishima float.

00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:16.069 position:50% align:center
And then Kirishima chops
away at Todoroki's ice

00:12:16.152 --> 00:12:17.696 position:50% align:center
and sends it flying.

00:12:17.779 --> 00:12:20.824 position:50% align:center
Then, Aoyama can be a mirror
ball, and the light twinkling

00:12:20.907 --> 00:12:23.785 position:50% align:center
off him and the ice will make it
look like it's raining stardust!

And... And we can call
them "Team Snowmen"!

what we all needed.

00:12:39.509 --> 00:12:41.428 position:50% align:center
[HAGAKURE] We'll have to have a
crew working behind the scenes

[TENYA] All right! I'd call
this a unanimous decision!

00:14:56.021 --> 00:14:58.732 position:50% align:center
Well. Let's set
that aside, then.

00:14:58.815 --> 00:15:01.443 position:50% align:center
Now. We need guitars!
I'm thinking two!

00:15:01.526 --> 00:15:04.446 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah! Pick me! It's so
cool to play instruments!

00:15:04.529 --> 00:15:05.613 position:50% align:center
Let me strum!

00:15:05.697 --> 00:15:07.198 position:50% align:center
I'd just break the strings.

00:15:07.282 --> 00:15:09.576 position:50% align:center
Don't you dare volunteer unless
you're gonna kill it, dimwit.

00:15:09.659 --> 00:15:11.536 position:50% align:center
Yeah! I totally will!

00:15:12.537 --> 00:15:15.415 position:50% align:center
The guitar is the star
of every rock band.

00:15:18.626 --> 00:15:21.921 position:50% align:center
My fingers won't reach because
of my character design!

00:15:22.005 --> 00:15:23.298 position:50% align:center
I wanna be on the dance crew!

00:15:23.381 --> 00:15:26.051 position:50% align:center
Me, too! I can move
pretty well with my tail.

00:15:26.134 --> 00:15:28.762 position:50% align:center
And I can use my tape to help
with the special effects.

00:15:28.845 --> 00:15:33.350 position:50% align:center
[guitar plays]

00:15:33.433 --> 00:15:35.894 position:50% align:center
It's like that riff is speaking
directly to my heart.

00:15:35.977 --> 00:15:38.563 position:50% align:center
[SHOJI] You can play?
Why didn't you say anything?

00:15:38.646 --> 00:15:41.816 position:50% align:center
I put down the axe when I
was bested by the F chord.

00:15:41.900 --> 00:15:43.068 position:50% align:center
[PRESENT MIC]
The F chord is a roadblock

00:15:43.151 --> 00:15:45.653 position:50% align:center
for many beginners
learning to play guitar!

00:15:45.737 --> 00:15:48.281 position:50% align:center
Mineta, if you can't
play for yourself,

00:15:48.365 --> 00:15:50.867 position:50% align:center
then I will strum
for you, as well.

00:15:50.950 --> 00:15:52.786 position:50% align:center
Do whatever you want, damnit.

00:15:52.869 --> 00:15:55.747 position:50% align:center
This is so stupid. Let's get
this festival over with.

00:15:55.830 --> 00:15:57.457 position:50% align:center
I hope all your nails break off.

00:15:57.540 --> 00:15:59.876 position:50% align:center
[ASHIDO] Mineta! Will you
be part of the dance team

00:15:59.959 --> 00:16:01.294 position:50% align:center
if I can get a harem together?

00:16:01.378 --> 00:16:04.964 position:50% align:center
The school festival
can't come soon enough!

00:16:05.048 --> 00:16:08.468 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] And so, a little after
one in the morning...

00:16:08.551 --> 00:16:09.803 position:50% align:center
[TENYA]
That's it!

00:16:09.886 --> 00:16:12.514 position:50% align:center
Everybody's role in the
festival has been decided!

00:16:12.597 --> 00:16:14.683 position:50% align:center
We've got the band team.

00:16:14.766 --> 00:16:17.185 position:50% align:center
And the effects team.

00:16:17.268 --> 00:16:19.854 position:50% align:center
And the dance team.

00:16:19.938 --> 00:16:22.649 position:50% align:center
Rest up, guys! Starting
tomorrow, we're hard at work!

00:16:22.732 --> 00:16:24.359 position:50% align:center
[STUDENTS]
Yeah!

00:16:28.154 --> 00:16:30.532 position:50% align:center
[ALL MIGHT] I heard what you
guys are doing for the festival.

00:16:30.615 --> 00:16:33.743 position:50% align:center
Some kind of live performance
combined with a dance party?

00:16:33.827 --> 00:16:35.412 position:50% align:center
That sounds like a good time.

00:16:35.495 --> 00:16:37.664 position:50% align:center
Yeah. It'll take a lot
of work to pull off,

00:16:37.747 --> 00:16:40.208 position:50% align:center
but that's one of the things
I'm looking forward to.

00:16:40.291 --> 00:16:42.919 position:50% align:center
Well, with that in mind,
why did you want to meet?

00:16:43.003 --> 00:16:45.547 position:50% align:center
Heh. It feels like it's been
forever since we had a chance

00:16:45.630 --> 00:16:49.467 position:50% align:center
to sit down and talk,
just the two of us.

00:16:49.551 --> 00:16:52.721 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
During my work study,

00:16:52.804 --> 00:16:57.517 position:50% align:center
I was able to fight using
20 percent of One For All.

00:16:57.600 --> 00:16:59.352 position:50% align:center
It took a toll on my body,

00:16:59.436 --> 00:17:02.355 position:50% align:center
and I could only use it
for a short period of time.

00:17:02.439 --> 00:17:04.858 position:50% align:center
But even at that level,
I couldn't win.

00:17:04.941 --> 00:17:07.652 position:50% align:center
In fact, if Eri
hadn't been there,

00:17:07.736 --> 00:17:10.905 position:50% align:center
I probably would have
ended up dead.

00:17:10.989 --> 00:17:12.782 position:50% align:center
I couldn't do anything
to counter Chisaki's

00:17:12.866 --> 00:17:16.745 position:50% align:center
long-distance attacks. I've
tried to think of a solution,

00:17:16.828 --> 00:17:18.204 position:50% align:center
but I don't know how
I should fight

00:17:18.288 --> 00:17:19.914 position:50% align:center
in my current state,
when I still can't use

00:17:19.998 --> 00:17:22.042 position:50% align:center
a hundred percent
of my strength.

00:17:22.125 --> 00:17:25.086 position:50% align:center
I have to figure out
something new.

00:17:25.170 --> 00:17:27.505 position:50% align:center
Sounds like you're
at a dead end.

00:17:27.589 --> 00:17:29.632 position:50% align:center
That's right.

00:17:29.716 --> 00:17:32.344 position:50% align:center
[ALL MIGHT] There's only
one thing I can suggest.

00:17:32.427 --> 00:17:35.055 position:50% align:center
You need your own
long-distance attack.

00:17:35.138 --> 00:17:36.556 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Uh!

00:17:36.639 --> 00:17:38.558 position:50% align:center
I wish I could harness enough
power to pull off moves

00:17:38.641 --> 00:17:41.853 position:50% align:center
like you could, All Might!
But I'm not good enough yet.

00:17:41.936 --> 00:17:44.105 position:50% align:center
I've been thinkin'
about your progress.

00:17:44.189 --> 00:17:47.484 position:50% align:center
Analyzing the various
ways you've grown.

00:17:47.567 --> 00:17:51.196 position:50% align:center
And I have an idea.

00:17:51.279 --> 00:17:54.449 position:50% align:center
But I think we should
take this outside.

00:17:54.532 --> 00:17:56.159 position:50% align:center
Go change into
your gym clothes.

00:17:56.242 --> 00:17:57.911 position:50% align:center
I'll meet you out there.

00:17:58.953 --> 00:18:01.122 position:50% align:center
You want me to use
20 percent here?

00:18:01.206 --> 00:18:03.583 position:50% align:center
Right! Just go Full Cowling!

00:18:03.667 --> 00:18:06.711 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] But... Like I
was saying earlier,

00:18:06.795 --> 00:18:09.839 position:50% align:center
when I'm at 20 percent, it puts
a lot of strain on my body

00:18:09.923 --> 00:18:11.883 position:50% align:center
and I end up not being
able to move well.

00:18:11.966 --> 00:18:14.302 position:50% align:center
That's why I'm working hard
to strengthen up right now.

00:18:14.386 --> 00:18:16.554 position:50% align:center
So? Forget that and just do it!

00:18:16.638 --> 00:18:18.682 position:50% align:center
Uh! Yes, sir!

00:18:20.517 --> 00:18:24.938 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] One For All:
Full Cowling... 20 percent.

00:18:27.357 --> 00:18:30.360 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU grunting]

00:18:30.443 --> 00:18:32.028 position:50% align:center
Now stay at this
level and attack

00:18:32.112 --> 00:18:33.738 position:50% align:center
as though an enemy
was in front of you.

00:18:33.822 --> 00:18:36.324 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU grunting]

00:18:38.451 --> 00:18:39.786 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU grunts]

00:18:43.123 --> 00:18:44.708 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
The wind pressure.

00:18:44.791 --> 00:18:46.501 position:50% align:center
I was going to teach you
this once you were able

00:18:46.584 --> 00:18:48.712 position:50% align:center
to use 15 percent without
thinking about it,

00:18:48.795 --> 00:18:51.297 position:50% align:center
but it sounds like you
need the lesson now.

00:18:51.381 --> 00:18:53.675 position:50% align:center
If you didn't figure this
out in that last fight,

00:18:53.758 --> 00:18:56.761 position:50% align:center
you must have been concentrating
really hard on your defense.

00:18:56.845 --> 00:18:58.471 position:50% align:center
You didn't realize

00:18:58.555 --> 00:19:00.765 position:50% align:center
you have the power to
weaponize wind pressure

00:19:00.849 --> 00:19:02.642 position:50% align:center
without breaking yourself.

00:19:02.726 --> 00:19:03.852 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU groans]

00:19:03.935 --> 00:19:06.938 position:50% align:center
But wait. It still feels
like it's too much.

00:19:07.022 --> 00:19:10.942 position:50% align:center
Let's take a look at the stages
your training has gone through.

00:19:11.026 --> 00:19:13.361 position:50% align:center
First, use One For All
at 100 percent

00:19:13.445 --> 00:19:16.781 position:50% align:center
on one part of your body.
Second, control

00:19:16.865 --> 00:19:19.451 position:50% align:center
the percentage you use
on one part of your body.

00:19:19.534 --> 00:19:22.537 position:50% align:center
Third, control the percentage
you continuously use

00:19:22.620 --> 00:19:24.122 position:50% align:center
on your whole body.

00:19:24.205 --> 00:19:27.292 position:50% align:center
Fourth, use Shoot Style,
which utilizes your legs

00:19:27.375 --> 00:19:29.419 position:50% align:center
rather than your weaker arms.

00:19:29.502 --> 00:19:33.840 position:50% align:center
Fifth, raise your control from
five percent to eight percent.

00:19:33.923 --> 00:19:35.133 position:50% align:center
Finally, sixth.

00:19:35.216 --> 00:19:37.677 position:50% align:center
Use up to 20 percent for
a short amount of time,

00:19:37.761 --> 00:19:40.013 position:50% align:center
even if it's past your limit.

00:19:40.096 --> 00:19:42.682 position:50% align:center
And now, for today's lesson:

00:19:42.766 --> 00:19:44.309 position:50% align:center
How I used One For All.

00:19:44.392 --> 00:19:46.019 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] You weren't
continuously putting out

00:19:46.102 --> 00:19:49.064 position:50% align:center
100 percent of your
power, were you?

00:19:49.147 --> 00:19:50.982 position:50% align:center
[ALL MIGHT grunts]

00:19:51.066 --> 00:19:52.984 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] If All Might was
always at 100 percent,

00:19:53.068 --> 00:19:54.694 position:50% align:center
his every move would
create shock waves

00:19:54.778 --> 00:19:56.696 position:50% align:center
and cause disaster
everywhere he went.

00:19:56.780 --> 00:19:59.783 position:50% align:center
It doesn't make sense to
constantly be at full power.

00:19:59.866 --> 00:20:02.327 position:50% align:center
Since I can't hold 20
percent for very long,

00:20:02.410 --> 00:20:04.954 position:50% align:center
I should combine the second
and sixth lessons I learned.

00:20:05.038 --> 00:20:07.207 position:50% align:center
I'll control the percentage
on one body part,

00:20:07.290 --> 00:20:09.584 position:50% align:center
and raise it to 20 percent
for a split second.

00:20:09.668 --> 00:20:11.044 position:50% align:center
A focused blast!

00:20:11.127 --> 00:20:12.879 position:50% align:center
That could work!

00:20:12.962 --> 00:20:15.882 position:50% align:center
Easy to say, but you
must be able to push past

00:20:15.965 --> 00:20:17.926 position:50% align:center
your normal limit in an instant.

00:20:18.009 --> 00:20:21.346 position:50% align:center
That requires a higher level of
control than you've used so far.

00:20:21.429 --> 00:20:23.973 position:50% align:center
Which means, I have a question
for you, Young Midoriya.

00:20:24.057 --> 00:20:26.017 position:50% align:center
What part of your body do
you think you can you move

00:20:26.101 --> 00:20:27.852 position:50% align:center
with the most precision?

00:20:30.522 --> 00:20:31.815 position:50% align:center
[ALL MIGHT]
That's right.

00:20:31.898 --> 00:20:33.358 position:50% align:center
Practice controlling One For All

00:20:33.441 --> 00:20:36.027 position:50% align:center
using your fingers
for this move.

00:20:36.111 --> 00:20:39.656 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] One For All: Full
Cowling at eight percent.

00:20:39.739 --> 00:20:45.161 position:50% align:center
And then, at the moment of the
attack, boost to 20 percent.

00:20:48.415 --> 00:20:50.458 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU grunting]

00:20:50.542 --> 00:20:52.168 position:50% align:center
You won't get the hang
of it right away,

00:20:52.252 --> 00:20:54.671 position:50% align:center
so be sure to keep at it, okay?

00:20:54.754 --> 00:20:55.964 position:50% align:center
Thanks for the advice, sir.

00:20:56.047 --> 00:20:59.175 position:50% align:center
I've got it. I know
what I have to do now.

00:21:02.345 --> 00:21:05.098 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] Once I master
controlling my power,

00:21:05.181 --> 00:21:08.059 position:50% align:center
I can go beyond,
to the next stage!

00:21:10.937 --> 00:21:12.731 position:50% align:center
[MIRIO]
Okay, this is it!

00:21:12.814 --> 00:21:16.443 position:50% align:center
Don't worry, Eri. Everyone's
nice here, I promise!

00:21:18.028 --> 00:21:20.947 position:50% align:center
[MIRIO]
Welcome to UA High School!

00:22:54.290 --> 00:22:56.209 position:50% align:center
[GENTLE]
Gentle Video.

00:22:57.502 --> 00:22:58.962 position:50% align:center
[GENTLE]
Dearest viewers,

00:22:59.045 --> 00:23:01.297 position:50% align:center
do you drink different types of
tea for different occasions?

00:23:01.381 --> 00:23:03.800 position:50% align:center
Whenever I'm preparing
my personal kettle,

00:23:03.883 --> 00:23:07.637 position:50% align:center
I select a tea that correlates
to the size of my current job.

00:23:07.721 --> 00:23:10.223 position:50% align:center
This particular fine blend
is called Royal Flush.

00:23:10.306 --> 00:23:12.851 position:50% align:center
Whatever could that
name imply, I wonder.

00:23:12.934 --> 00:23:14.185 position:50% align:center
[LA BRAVA] That your
discriminating taste

00:23:14.269 --> 00:23:16.229 position:50% align:center
sets you apart from
the rest of the world?

00:23:16.312 --> 00:23:17.731 position:50% align:center
Be sure to stay tuned.

00:23:17.814 --> 00:23:19.733 position:50% align:center
My next video will
be an alarm bell,

00:23:19.816 --> 00:23:21.359 position:50% align:center
not just to my
ever-faithful viewers,

00:23:21.443 --> 00:23:23.278 position:50% align:center
but to all of society.

00:23:23.361 --> 00:23:25.822 position:50% align:center
Try to contain your
anticipation till then.

00:23:25.905 --> 00:23:27.782 position:50% align:center
[LA BRAVA screams]

00:23:29.701 --> 00:23:31.119 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Here's the preview!

00:23:31.202 --> 00:23:33.747 position:50% align:center
The clock is ticking as we
prepare for the school festival,

00:23:33.830 --> 00:23:35.832 position:50% align:center
but we're excited
for Eri's visit!

00:23:35.915 --> 00:23:38.668 position:50% align:center
