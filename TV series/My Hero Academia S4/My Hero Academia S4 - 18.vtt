[IZUKU] This world is
a superhuman society,

00:00:12.095 --> 00:00:14.556 position:50% align:center
with about 80 percent of
the population possessing

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.892 position:50% align:center
some uncanny ability
called a "Quirk."

00:00:17.976 --> 00:00:20.061 position:50% align:center
Those who stand up against
villains who abuse

00:00:20.145 --> 00:00:23.023 position:50% align:center
their powers for evil
are called heroes.

00:00:23.106 --> 00:00:25.150 position:50% align:center
They are our champions.

00:00:30.155 --> 00:00:32.157 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
My name is Izuku Midoriya,

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:34.909 position:50% align:center
and I've always dreamed
of being a hero.

00:00:34.993 --> 00:00:39.539 position:50% align:center
So I enrolled in the
prestigious UA High School.

00:00:39.622 --> 00:00:42.542 position:50% align:center
My friends and I are working
hard toward a shared goal,

00:00:42.625 --> 00:00:45.045 position:50% align:center
facing every challenge
that comes our way,

00:00:45.128 --> 00:00:47.589 position:50% align:center
and saving people with a smile.

00:00:49.966 --> 00:00:53.345 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] We're training to become
the world's greatest heroes.

00:00:53.428 --> 00:00:58.350 position:50% align:center
That's right. This is
<i>My Hero Academia.</i>

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:36.531 position:50% align:center
Hey, guys! C'mere! Check this!

00:02:36.614 --> 00:02:41.369 position:50% align:center
[music plays]

00:02:41.453 --> 00:02:43.204 position:50% align:center
[ASHIDO]
I'm a breakdancing queen!

00:02:43.288 --> 00:02:44.914 position:50% align:center
--[SERO] Aw, yeah!
--[HAGAKURE] Get it!

00:02:44.998 --> 00:02:46.374 position:50% align:center
[ASHIDO]
Clock this breakdown!

00:02:46.458 --> 00:02:47.459 position:50% align:center
[SERO]
You're on fire!

00:02:47.542 --> 00:02:49.627 position:50% align:center
She's obviously
practiced extensively.

00:02:49.711 --> 00:02:52.297 position:50% align:center
Why're you wearing shorts
underneath your skirt?

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.716 position:50% align:center
[HAGAKURE] When will you learn
to stop being such a creep?!

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:56.676 position:50% align:center
I bet Ashido's dancing
skills end up being

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.845 position:50% align:center
super useful in
hand-to-hand combat.

00:02:58.928 --> 00:03:00.388 position:50% align:center
When it comes to a fight,

00:03:00.472 --> 00:03:04.059 position:50% align:center
she would have complete control
over every part of her body.

00:03:04.142 --> 00:03:06.353 position:50% align:center
Oui. I've witnessed that.

00:03:06.436 --> 00:03:10.023 position:50% align:center
She burned through my cape
in our first training match,

00:03:10.106 --> 00:03:13.234 position:50% align:center
and then, in the sports
festival finals...

00:03:14.277 --> 00:03:16.196 position:50% align:center
I will never forget that.

00:03:16.279 --> 00:03:18.448 position:50% align:center
Huh, maybe I should
take up dancing, too.

00:03:18.531 --> 00:03:19.949 position:50% align:center
She could teach ya!

00:03:20.033 --> 00:03:22.702 position:50% align:center
[ASHIDO] Aw, yeah, boi, let's
see what moves you've got.

00:03:22.786 --> 00:03:25.789 position:50% align:center
Um. Okay! Please show me how.

00:03:25.872 --> 00:03:28.041 position:50% align:center
[ASHIDO]
We'll start with somethin' easy.

00:03:28.124 --> 00:03:29.876 position:50% align:center
Step forward and back
and left and right,

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:31.920 position:50% align:center
while swinging both arms.

00:03:32.003 --> 00:03:34.839 position:50% align:center
Make sure you're stayin' loose!

00:03:34.923 --> 00:03:36.091 position:50% align:center
Sure.

00:03:36.174 --> 00:03:39.052 position:50% align:center
Think I got it! Yep!

00:03:39.135 --> 00:03:41.846 position:50% align:center
This reminds me of how
Sato's always baking stuff.

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:44.224 position:50% align:center
It's a hobby, but also
helps out with hero work.

00:03:44.307 --> 00:03:45.934 position:50% align:center
Man. So smart.

00:03:46.017 --> 00:03:48.436 position:50% align:center
Speaking of hobbies, I bet
yours is the same, Jiro.

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:49.938 position:50% align:center
What? I don't know...

00:03:50.021 --> 00:03:51.147 position:50% align:center
Come on!

00:03:51.231 --> 00:03:53.733 position:50% align:center
Your dorm room looks
like a recording studio!

00:03:53.817 --> 00:03:56.611 position:50% align:center
One look and I could tell
music is your whole life.

00:03:56.695 --> 00:04:00.240 position:50% align:center
Drop it, moron. Forget about
what you saw in there.

00:04:00.323 --> 00:04:02.534 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah. That's passion.

00:04:02.617 --> 00:04:04.953 position:50% align:center
For real, though. You
should start a jam sess--

00:04:05.036 --> 00:04:06.705 position:50% align:center
[whimpering]

00:04:06.788 --> 00:04:08.373 position:50% align:center
Just shut it.

00:04:12.961 --> 00:04:14.337 position:50% align:center
What?

00:04:20.427 --> 00:04:21.761 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
October was here.

00:04:21.845 --> 00:04:23.805 position:50% align:center
Which meant it was about
time for UA High School

00:04:23.888 --> 00:04:27.726 position:50% align:center
to start preparing for a big
event around the corner.

00:04:27.809 --> 00:04:29.894 position:50% align:center
Sure, we weren't the
only school doing this,

00:04:29.978 --> 00:04:32.522 position:50% align:center
but we were still excited.

00:04:32.605 --> 00:04:36.067 position:50% align:center
[AIZAWA] It's coming.
The school festival.

00:04:36.151 --> 00:04:38.778 position:50% align:center
[STUDENTS]
Normal school stuff!

00:04:38.862 --> 00:04:39.696 position:50% align:center
So awesome!

00:04:39.779 --> 00:04:41.322 position:50% align:center
Gotta love this time of year!

00:04:41.406 --> 00:04:43.283 position:50% align:center
[HAGAKURE] We gotta think
of something cool to do!

00:04:43.366 --> 00:04:46.536 position:50% align:center
Hold on, Mr. Aizawa.
Are you sure this is okay?

00:04:46.619 --> 00:04:49.164 position:50% align:center
Hush, Kirishima.
Don't you ruin this!

00:04:49.247 --> 00:04:50.498 position:50% align:center
Think about it, though.

00:04:50.582 --> 00:04:52.917 position:50% align:center
There are villains
everywhere right now!

00:04:53.001 --> 00:04:55.920 position:50% align:center
You're right. That's
a reasonable point.

00:04:56.004 --> 00:04:58.131 position:50% align:center
However, there are students here

00:04:58.214 --> 00:05:00.842 position:50% align:center
besides those in
the hero course.

00:05:00.925 --> 00:05:03.553 position:50% align:center
You get the spotlight
every year at the sports fest.

00:05:03.636 --> 00:05:05.555 position:50% align:center
This is for everyone else.

00:05:05.638 --> 00:05:07.932 position:50% align:center
The support course,
general studies,

00:05:08.016 --> 00:05:10.602 position:50% align:center
and don't forget the
business course students.

00:05:10.685 --> 00:05:13.521 position:50% align:center
This doesn't get as much
attention as the sports fest,

00:05:13.605 --> 00:05:16.649 position:50% align:center
but it's still the yearly event
they all look forward to.

00:05:16.733 --> 00:05:18.693 position:50% align:center
Many of your peers
are feeling stressed out

00:05:18.777 --> 00:05:20.653 position:50% align:center
by the current
conditions here at UA.

00:05:20.737 --> 00:05:22.238 position:50% align:center
Especially the dorm system,

00:05:22.322 --> 00:05:25.283 position:50% align:center
which had to be adopted
because of the hero course.

00:05:25.367 --> 00:05:29.037 position:50% align:center
When you put it like that, guess
it'd be unfair to cancel it.

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:30.038 position:50% align:center
[AIZAWA]
Correct.

00:05:30.121 --> 00:05:31.873 position:50% align:center
So, yeah. It's still on.

00:05:31.956 --> 00:05:34.501 position:50% align:center
And hopefully everyone
will enjoy it.

00:05:34.584 --> 00:05:36.836 position:50% align:center
Though unlike
festivals in the past,

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:40.006 position:50% align:center
this year's will only be open
to UA students and staff.

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:41.966 position:50% align:center
With a few exceptions.

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:44.094 position:50% align:center
You may not be
the focus this time,

00:05:44.177 --> 00:05:45.970 position:50% align:center
but your class still
needs to participate

00:05:46.054 --> 00:05:48.556 position:50% align:center
with some kind of
original programming.

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:52.060 position:50% align:center
You need to decide what
you want to do today.

00:05:52.143 --> 00:05:53.478 position:50% align:center
[AIZAWA snores]

00:05:53.561 --> 00:05:55.188 position:50% align:center
[STUDENTS]
He's out!

00:05:56.523 --> 00:05:58.441 position:50% align:center
All right! As class
representative,

00:05:58.525 --> 00:06:01.528 position:50% align:center
it is my duty to facilitate
the process from here!

00:06:01.611 --> 00:06:04.280 position:50% align:center
I promise I will do my
very best. Let's start!

00:06:04.364 --> 00:06:07.117 position:50% align:center
First, we will have a quick
brainstorming session!

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:08.952 position:50% align:center
If anyone has an idea,
raise your hand!

00:06:09.035 --> 00:06:10.203 position:50% align:center
[STUDENTS]
Me, me, me, me!

00:06:10.286 --> 00:06:13.039 position:50% align:center
Well, I wasn't expecting
such enthusiasm!

00:06:13.123 --> 00:06:15.542 position:50% align:center
Calm down now! We'll go
one at a time, please.

00:06:15.625 --> 00:06:17.293 position:50% align:center
Yes! You, Kaminari!

00:06:17.377 --> 00:06:18.878 position:50% align:center
A maid cafe!

00:06:18.962 --> 00:06:21.172 position:50% align:center
Seriously! Imagine it!

00:06:21.256 --> 00:06:24.384 position:50% align:center
Now imagine it again,
but with more details.

00:06:24.467 --> 00:06:26.636 position:50% align:center
And if you imagine me in
the center of the action...

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:28.054 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah.

00:06:28.138 --> 00:06:30.056 position:50% align:center
I think we've already
got a winner.

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:32.684 position:50% align:center
Maids. It is good
to serve others.

00:06:32.767 --> 00:06:34.060 position:50% align:center
That's way too tame!

00:06:34.144 --> 00:06:36.813 position:50% align:center
--[TENYA] Mineta!
--A topless--

00:06:36.896 --> 00:06:38.815 position:50% align:center
Wanna help me tie this off?

00:06:38.898 --> 00:06:40.316 position:50% align:center
Sure thing.

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:41.526 position:50% align:center
A mochi shop!

00:06:41.609 --> 00:06:43.194 position:50% align:center
[TENYA]
Celebrating Japanese cuisine!

00:06:43.278 --> 00:06:44.529 position:50% align:center
An arm-wrestling match.

00:06:44.612 --> 00:06:45.447 position:50% align:center
[TENYA]
So intense!

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:47.032 position:50% align:center
[HAGAKURE]
A fun house!

00:06:47.115 --> 00:06:48.450 position:50% align:center
[TENYA] I don't know what you
mean, but sounds interesting!

00:06:48.533 --> 00:06:49.701 position:50% align:center
A crêperie!

00:06:49.784 --> 00:06:51.161 position:50% align:center
[TENYA] That'd be great
for eating on the go!

00:06:51.244 --> 00:06:52.037 position:50% align:center
Disco!

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:53.079 position:50% align:center
[TENYA]
Sounds invigorating!

00:06:53.163 --> 00:06:54.039 position:50% align:center
A Hero quiz.

00:06:54.122 --> 00:06:55.290 position:50% align:center
[TENYA]
As I'd expect from you!

00:06:55.373 --> 00:06:56.791 position:50% align:center
The "Frog Song" in a round.

00:06:56.875 --> 00:06:57.959 position:50% align:center
[TENYA]
How charming!

00:06:58.043 --> 00:06:59.294 position:50% align:center
Maybe a petting zoo.

00:06:59.377 --> 00:07:00.420 position:50% align:center
[TENYA]
Also a suggestion!

00:07:00.503 --> 00:07:01.379 position:50% align:center
Soba stall.

00:07:01.463 --> 00:07:02.589 position:50% align:center
[TENYA]
It is your favorite!

00:07:02.672 --> 00:07:03.715 position:50% align:center
Fight to the death.

00:07:03.798 --> 00:07:05.216 position:50% align:center
[TENYA]
Unexpected for a festival.

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:06.676 position:50% align:center
A mad banquet of darkness.

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:07.635 position:50% align:center
[TENYA]
Oh-ho-ho-ho!

00:07:07.719 --> 00:07:09.137 position:50% align:center
A twinkling extravaganza!

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:09.971 position:50% align:center
[TENYA]
Huh?

00:07:10.055 --> 00:07:11.097 position:50% align:center
Maybe a skit?

00:07:11.181 --> 00:07:12.265 position:50% align:center
[TENYA]
Possibly!

00:07:12.349 --> 00:07:13.391 position:50% align:center
[KAMINARI]
Hm?

00:07:13.475 --> 00:07:15.268 position:50% align:center

Right. Anybody else?

00:07:15.352 --> 00:07:16.478 position:50% align:center
[SERO]
A traditional café!

[TENYA] Okay. I think we've got
something from everyone now.

00:07:23.943 --> 00:07:26.279 position:50% align:center
To begin with, let's cut some.

00:07:26.363 --> 00:07:30.116 position:50% align:center
Anything inappropriate,
impossible, or confusing.

--So harsh.
--[MINETA] Aww!

00:07:32.702 --> 00:07:34.788 position:50% align:center
Why'd you even bother asking?

00:07:34.871 --> 00:07:37.123 position:50% align:center
[HAGAKURE] Who said a local
history presentation?

00:07:37.207 --> 00:07:38.500 position:50% align:center
That sounds super boring.

00:07:38.583 --> 00:07:39.959 position:50% align:center
[SHOJI]
Definitely.

00:07:40.043 --> 00:07:42.003 position:50% align:center
[OJIRO] It's not awful, but
the others seem more fun.

00:07:42.087 --> 00:07:44.381 position:50% align:center
Very well, my classmates
have spoken.

00:07:44.464 --> 00:07:46.883 position:50% align:center
[KAMINARI] And we do group
study sessions all the time.

00:07:46.966 --> 00:07:49.928 position:50% align:center
Yes, that's true. I guess...

00:07:50.011 --> 00:07:52.472 position:50% align:center
What if we rolled all the
food stuff into one idea?

00:07:52.555 --> 00:07:54.974 position:50% align:center
Doesn't soba with crêpes
kinda sound gross?

00:07:55.058 --> 00:07:58.395 position:50% align:center
Besides, seems kinda weird
to offer a buncha random food.

00:07:58.478 --> 00:07:59.938 position:50% align:center
Quiet down!

00:08:00.021 --> 00:08:01.481 position:50% align:center
[HAGAKURE] I'm telling you--
a fun house would be so cool!

00:08:01.564 --> 00:08:02.941 position:50% align:center
[KAMINARI]
What does that even mean?

00:08:03.024 --> 00:08:05.360 position:50% align:center
Silence! Be civil!

00:08:05.443 --> 00:08:07.487 position:50% align:center
A consensus is going
to be difficult.

00:08:07.570 --> 00:08:09.030 position:50% align:center
Order! Please!

00:08:09.114 --> 00:08:11.866 position:50% align:center
[bell chimes]

00:08:11.950 --> 00:08:15.120 position:50% align:center
[AIZAWA] That was a highly
unproductive meeting.

00:08:15.203 --> 00:08:17.914 position:50% align:center
Decide what you'll do
by tomorrow morning.

00:08:17.997 --> 00:08:21.668 position:50% align:center
If you don't, we'll
go with my idea:

00:08:21.751 --> 00:08:23.545 position:50% align:center
an educational lecture.

00:08:23.628 --> 00:08:25.672 position:50% align:center
[STUDENTS]
You mean, just a class?

00:08:26.798 --> 00:08:28.133 position:50% align:center
Who'd come see that?

00:08:28.216 --> 00:08:29.843 position:50% align:center
He's joking, right?

00:08:29.926 --> 00:08:32.637 position:50% align:center
[KIRISHIMA] No way. We'll decide
what we're gonna do by tonight!

00:08:32.721 --> 00:08:34.597 position:50% align:center
[STUDENTS]
Yeah!

00:08:37.434 --> 00:08:39.519 position:50% align:center
[OJIRO]
Huh. Where's the raid team?

00:08:39.602 --> 00:08:42.022 position:50% align:center
Not here. They're catching
up on extra classes,

00:08:42.105 --> 00:08:43.857 position:50% align:center
so we'll have to pick for them.

00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:45.150 position:50% align:center
What about Bakugo?

00:08:45.233 --> 00:08:46.317 position:50% align:center
[KAMINARI]
Sleeping.

00:08:46.401 --> 00:08:47.736 position:50% align:center
[TENYA] Now that things
have quieted down,

00:08:47.819 --> 00:08:49.738 position:50% align:center
I have some thoughts
about our list.

00:08:49.821 --> 00:08:50.947 position:50% align:center
It's obvious that we've caused

00:08:51.031 --> 00:08:52.949 position:50% align:center
some strain on
the other students.

00:08:53.033 --> 00:08:54.451 position:50% align:center
It would make sense
to choose something

00:08:54.534 --> 00:08:55.744 position:50% align:center
that might raise their spirits

00:08:55.827 --> 00:08:57.495 position:50% align:center
in an effort to make
it up to them.

00:08:57.579 --> 00:08:58.955 position:50% align:center
I don't disagree.

00:08:59.039 --> 00:09:00.623 position:50% align:center
We're aiming to
be heroes, right?

00:09:00.707 --> 00:09:03.835 position:50% align:center
So we should be aware of any
trouble we've caused for others.

00:09:03.918 --> 00:09:05.545 position:50% align:center
Correct, and with that in mind,

00:09:05.628 --> 00:09:07.422 position:50% align:center
I don't think we can offer
the students of UA

00:09:07.505 --> 00:09:09.466 position:50% align:center
a meal that satisfies
their taste buds,

00:09:09.549 --> 00:09:11.801 position:50% align:center
since they're used to
Lunch Rush's gourmet cooking.

00:09:11.885 --> 00:09:14.095 position:50% align:center
Aw, so food is out
of the question?

00:09:14.179 --> 00:09:15.930 position:50% align:center
[TENYA] I believe that
would be for the best.

00:09:16.014 --> 00:09:18.099 position:50% align:center
There must be another way
we can be of service.

00:09:18.183 --> 00:09:20.393 position:50% align:center
[SHOJI] We have to keep
their needs in mind.

00:09:20.477 --> 00:09:22.103 position:50% align:center
If we're the only
ones having fun,

00:09:22.187 --> 00:09:23.605 position:50% align:center
the event'll be a disaster.

00:09:23.688 --> 00:09:26.649 position:50% align:center
It's frustrating, but Lunch
Rush is just too good.

00:09:26.733 --> 00:09:27.817 position:50% align:center
[HAGAKURE]
'Kay. So, what, then?

00:09:27.901 --> 00:09:30.528 position:50% align:center
Well, we can cut out
all the food ideas,

00:09:30.612 --> 00:09:33.281 position:50% align:center
and that way, we can
focus on experiences.

00:09:33.365 --> 00:09:35.241 position:50% align:center
There's the maid café,
petting zoo,

00:09:35.325 --> 00:09:37.911 position:50% align:center
and whatever a fun house is.

00:09:37.994 --> 00:09:40.997 position:50% align:center
A zoo sounds kinda
smelly and unsanitary.

00:09:41.081 --> 00:09:43.500 position:50% align:center
[HAGAKURE]
Hmm, stress relief...

00:09:43.583 --> 00:09:45.418 position:50% align:center
I still think a skit
would be a lot of fun.

00:09:45.502 --> 00:09:48.380 position:50% align:center
Watching amateurs perform
can be pretty stressful.

00:09:48.463 --> 00:09:50.715 position:50% align:center
Why don't we have
a big dance party?

00:09:50.799 --> 00:09:51.591 position:50% align:center
[TODOROKI grunts]

00:09:51.675 --> 00:09:53.885 position:50% align:center
Dancing. That's a good idea.

00:09:53.968 --> 00:09:56.680 position:50% align:center
Uh? Wait, you mean
you'd be into that?

00:09:56.763 --> 00:09:58.181 position:50% align:center
[TODOROKI]
Hang on a second.

00:09:58.264 --> 00:10:00.225 position:50% align:center
There's something
I've seen before.

00:10:00.308 --> 00:10:01.851 position:50% align:center
I don't know what
it's called, exactly,

00:10:01.935 --> 00:10:03.812 position:50% align:center
but it looks like everyone
really enjoys it.

00:10:05.063 --> 00:10:06.898 position:50% align:center
[TODOROKI]
There, something like this.

00:10:06.981 --> 00:10:09.109 position:50% align:center
[MINETA] Not what I
expected from Todoroki.

00:10:09.192 --> 00:10:11.861 position:50% align:center
Uh! Wait, are you some
kinda secret raver?

00:10:11.945 --> 00:10:15.115 position:50% align:center
[TODOROKI] No. I just agree with
Iida's opinion that we should

00:10:15.198 --> 00:10:18.159 position:50% align:center
provide stress relief for the
people in the other courses.

00:10:18.243 --> 00:10:20.203 position:50% align:center
In order to do that,
maybe we should focus

00:10:20.286 --> 00:10:23.665 position:50% align:center
on something that offers
entertainment for everyone.

00:10:23.748 --> 00:10:26.334 position:50% align:center
I got the idea from
my extra exam training.

00:10:26.418 --> 00:10:27.836 position:50% align:center
[CROWD cheers]

00:10:27.919 --> 00:10:30.422 position:50% align:center
[SATO] What're they doing in
those supplemental classes?

00:10:30.505 --> 00:10:33.383 position:50% align:center
Interesting. Singing
and dancing, huh?

00:10:33.466 --> 00:10:35.218 position:50% align:center
None of us really dances, do we?

00:10:35.301 --> 00:10:37.137 position:50% align:center
No one wants to see
a cringy routine.

00:10:37.220 --> 00:10:40.181 position:50% align:center
No prob. I got you, fam!

[AOYAMA]
<i>C'est magnifique!</i>

how to throw it down!

The work of a real dance
master right there!

00:10:46.479 --> 00:10:48.440 position:50% align:center
I've got total faith
in her skills.

00:10:48.523 --> 00:10:51.443 position:50% align:center
Hold on, you idiots!
Dance is about rhythm!

00:10:51.526 --> 00:10:55.739 position:50% align:center
Thunderous beats! If we do this,
we'll need some serious jams!

00:10:55.822 --> 00:10:57.615 position:50% align:center
[HAGAKURE] Well, if we're
talking about music...

00:10:57.699 --> 00:10:58.908 position:50% align:center
[JIRO gasps]

00:11:00.785 --> 00:11:02.912 position:50% align:center
[JIRO]
Uh. What?

00:11:03.788 --> 00:11:06.416 position:50% align:center
[HAGAKURE] Why don't we perform
live? With all your instruments?

00:11:06.499 --> 00:11:07.834 position:50% align:center
Absolutely not!

00:11:07.917 --> 00:11:09.419 position:50% align:center
[HAGAKURE]
What's wrong?

00:11:09.502 --> 00:11:12.130 position:50% align:center
You're really good at playing
and teaching people how to play!

00:11:12.213 --> 00:11:14.174 position:50% align:center
And you always look like
you're having a ton of fun

00:11:14.257 --> 00:11:16.009 position:50% align:center
when you make music!

00:11:16.092 --> 00:11:19.971 position:50% align:center
I bet everyone in school would
love to hear you rock out!

00:11:21.264 --> 00:11:24.642 position:50% align:center
[JIRO]
No. I'm not Ashido or Sato.

00:11:24.726 --> 00:11:27.395 position:50% align:center
Their hobbies actually
help their hero work.

00:11:27.479 --> 00:11:29.689 position:50% align:center
They have a purpose.

00:11:29.773 --> 00:11:33.943 position:50% align:center
But music... It really
is just a hobby.

think it's something

to the school.

00:11:38.490 --> 00:11:40.867 position:50% align:center
Speaking of hobbies,
I bet yours is the same, Jiro.

00:11:40.950 --> 00:11:42.744 position:50% align:center
What? I don't know.

00:11:42.827 --> 00:11:44.579 position:50% align:center
Just shut it.

00:11:44.662 --> 00:11:47.749 position:50% align:center
Oh, that's why you got weird.

00:11:51.836 --> 00:11:53.922 position:50% align:center
But you can play
so many instruments!

You're freakin' awesome!

[KODA]
Jiro!

00:11:58.677 --> 00:12:01.471 position:50% align:center
Why not use your skill to
make other people smile?

00:12:01.554 --> 00:12:03.682 position:50% align:center
I think your music will
definitely be useful

00:12:03.765 --> 00:12:05.725 position:50% align:center
when you're a pro!

00:12:06.935 --> 00:12:09.813 position:50% align:center
Look, I understand where
both of you are coming from,

00:12:09.896 --> 00:12:11.398 position:50% align:center
but it is her choice.

00:12:11.481 --> 00:12:13.441 position:50% align:center
If she doesn't wanna
perform, that's fine.

00:12:13.525 --> 00:12:16.695 position:50% align:center
Well, after what
you've all said...

00:12:16.778 --> 00:12:19.864 position:50% align:center
If I didn't do it,

00:12:19.948 --> 00:12:22.409 position:50% align:center
I guess it wouldn't
be rockin' at all.

Sorry we couldn't
come see you sooner.

yummy snacks, though!

[TSUYU] Eri said that she
wants to see Midoriya?

00:13:09.998 --> 00:13:12.167 position:50% align:center
[AIZAWA]
Yes. More specifically,

00:13:12.250 --> 00:13:15.128 position:50% align:center
she seems concerned
about him and Togata.

00:13:15.211 --> 00:13:17.213 position:50% align:center
Apparently, this is
her only request

00:13:17.297 --> 00:13:19.090 position:50% align:center
since she regained
consciousness.

00:13:19.174 --> 00:13:21.176 position:50% align:center
So we're obliging her.

[NURSE 81A]
Are we sure this is okay?

00:13:25.722 --> 00:13:28.016 position:50% align:center
You said it'd be better
for her to be quarantined

00:13:28.099 --> 00:13:31.019 position:50% align:center
and kept away from anyone
involved in the incident.

00:13:31.102 --> 00:13:33.271 position:50% align:center
I was worried about her powers,

00:13:33.355 --> 00:13:37.067 position:50% align:center
but now I don't think
we need to be concerned.

00:13:37.150 --> 00:13:39.069 position:50% align:center

enough energy left

all I could think about was
how much you did for me.

know what to call you.

that's it. So, who are you?

00:14:04.469 --> 00:14:07.180 position:50% align:center
Deku's probably easier to
remember since it's shorter.

00:14:07.263 --> 00:14:09.265 position:50% align:center
So, yeah. I'm Deku!

A Hero name?

00:14:10.642 --> 00:14:13.019 position:50% align:center

Deku.

From what I understand,

00:14:35.166 --> 00:14:37.794 position:50% align:center
she's racked with guilt,
and has been blaming herself

for everything that happened.

that happened...

00:14:47.137 --> 00:14:49.431 position:50% align:center
I'm so sorry.

00:14:49.514 --> 00:14:51.808 position:50% align:center
[AIZAWA]
She'll find out someday,

00:14:51.891 --> 00:14:54.894 position:50% align:center
but it's too cruel
to tell her now.

00:14:54.978 --> 00:14:58.189 position:50% align:center
I know that... that
you lost your power

00:14:58.273 --> 00:15:01.192 position:50% align:center
because you were
protecting me, Lemillion.

00:15:01.276 --> 00:15:02.402 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:15:02.485 --> 00:15:04.696 position:50% align:center
[MIRIO]
Eri.

00:15:04.779 --> 00:15:06.489 position:50% align:center
I guarantee that none
of us think this

00:15:06.573 --> 00:15:08.199 position:50% align:center
was your fault at all.

00:15:08.283 --> 00:15:10.493 position:50% align:center
You know what we are
thinking though?

00:15:10.577 --> 00:15:13.830 position:50% align:center
"Man, I am stupid glad
that Eri's okay."

00:15:13.913 --> 00:15:16.082 position:50% align:center
So ya see, there's no
point in apologizing.

00:15:16.166 --> 00:15:19.336 position:50% align:center
Promise! Don't worry about it.

00:15:19.419 --> 00:15:23.548 position:50% align:center
Besides, everyone fought because
they wanted to see you smile.

00:15:28.386 --> 00:15:31.931 position:50% align:center
[grunting]

00:15:34.517 --> 00:15:35.935 position:50% align:center
--[IZUKU] Uh.
--[MIRIO] Hm?

00:15:39.689 --> 00:15:44.986 position:50% align:center
This is so silly. I think I've
forgotten how smiling feels.

00:15:46.029 --> 00:15:47.739 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Eri...

00:15:50.033 --> 00:15:53.995 position:50% align:center
[CHISAKI] Someone else is
about to die because of you!

00:15:54.079 --> 00:15:57.791 position:50% align:center
Ah, yes, it's so much
easier to be hurt yourself

00:15:57.874 --> 00:16:01.670 position:50% align:center
than to watch while others
are hurt for you, isn't it?

00:16:02.962 --> 00:16:05.757 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] Chisaki's shadow
is blocking out the light.

00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:09.386 position:50% align:center
The horrible things he did
are still hurting her.

00:16:09.469 --> 00:16:13.640 position:50% align:center
This girl hasn't been
saved. Not completely.

00:16:14.724 --> 00:16:16.476 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] She doesn't know the
first thing about what it means

00:16:16.559 --> 00:16:19.562 position:50% align:center
to be happy, or
even how to smile.

00:16:20.563 --> 00:16:22.107 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Come on, think.

00:16:22.190 --> 00:16:25.068 position:50% align:center
There has to be something
I can do to help her.

00:16:25.151 --> 00:16:27.570 position:50% align:center
Surprise.

00:16:27.654 --> 00:16:30.115 position:50% align:center
Aren't surprises the best?

00:16:32.075 --> 00:16:33.326 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:16:33.410 --> 00:16:35.787 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Wait. According to the doctor,

00:16:35.870 --> 00:16:39.457 position:50% align:center
now that her horn is smaller,
she's more in control,

00:16:39.541 --> 00:16:42.460 position:50% align:center
and less likely to accidentally
use her power.

00:16:43.586 --> 00:16:45.797 position:50% align:center
Though unlike festivals
in the past,

00:16:45.880 --> 00:16:48.883 position:50% align:center
this year's will only be open
to UA students and staff.

00:16:48.967 --> 00:16:51.636 position:50% align:center
With a few exceptions.

00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:53.179 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
This is perfect.

00:16:53.263 --> 00:16:56.391 position:50% align:center
No real chance she'll run into
anyone from outside the school.

00:16:56.474 --> 00:16:58.601 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Mr. Aizawa!

00:16:58.685 --> 00:17:00.687 position:50% align:center
Do you think Eri could
leave the hospital?

00:17:00.770 --> 00:17:02.355 position:50% align:center
Just for one day, I mean.

00:17:02.439 --> 00:17:04.774 position:50% align:center
[AIZAWA] It's not totally
out of the question.

00:17:04.858 --> 00:17:07.110 position:50% align:center
Actually, we were thinking
we might have her--

00:17:07.193 --> 00:17:11.031 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] Then I have an idea
to bring her spirits up!

00:17:11.114 --> 00:17:12.824 position:50% align:center
[AIZAWA]
And what would that be?

00:17:12.907 --> 00:17:17.037 position:50% align:center
She should come with
us to the UA festival!

00:17:17.120 --> 00:17:18.621 position:50% align:center
[MIRIO]
Ha!

00:17:18.705 --> 00:17:19.748 position:50% align:center
What's a festival?

00:17:19.831 --> 00:17:22.751 position:50% align:center
Eri, this is the best idea ever!

00:17:22.834 --> 00:17:25.003 position:50% align:center
You're gonna have such a blast!

00:17:25.086 --> 00:17:28.006 position:50% align:center
A school festival is a festival
that takes place at our school!

00:17:28.089 --> 00:17:29.382 position:50% align:center
It's great!

00:17:29.466 --> 00:17:30.925 position:50% align:center
All the students plan
super-duper exciting things

00:17:31.009 --> 00:17:32.635 position:50% align:center
for the rest of the classes
to have fun with.

00:17:32.719 --> 00:17:35.472 position:50% align:center
There are different games and
performances, they sell food.

00:17:35.555 --> 00:17:39.225 position:50% align:center
Oh! And get this! I bet
there'll be candy apples there!

00:17:39.309 --> 00:17:40.935 position:50% align:center
What're candy apples?

00:17:41.019 --> 00:17:42.437 position:50% align:center
[MIRIO]
It's when they dip an apple

00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:46.232 position:50% align:center
into some crackly sugar stuff
and make it even sweeter!

00:17:46.316 --> 00:17:48.610 position:50% align:center
Sweeter how?

00:17:48.693 --> 00:17:51.863 position:50% align:center
[AIZAWA] All right. I'll talk
it over with the principal.

00:17:51.946 --> 00:17:53.656 position:50% align:center
Thank you!

00:17:53.740 --> 00:17:56.618 position:50% align:center
Well, Eri. What do you think?

00:17:57.994 --> 00:18:03.583 position:50% align:center
You know, a minute ago,
when I didn't know your name,

00:18:03.667 --> 00:18:06.836 position:50% align:center
I was sad and didn't
know what to do.

00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:09.172 position:50% align:center
Because I knew more
than anything

00:18:09.255 --> 00:18:12.384 position:50% align:center
that I just wanted to be friends
with the people who helped me.

00:18:12.467 --> 00:18:14.386 position:50% align:center
Yes! That's what we want, too!

00:18:14.469 --> 00:18:15.929 position:50% align:center
We should start putting
a case together

00:18:16.012 --> 00:18:17.347 position:50% align:center
to convince the principal.

00:18:17.430 --> 00:18:19.015 position:50% align:center
That way we can be sure
she'll be allowed to come out.

00:18:19.099 --> 00:18:20.600 position:50% align:center
Yeah!

00:18:20.684 --> 00:18:22.185 position:50% align:center
[MIRIO] I'm on a break
from school right now,

00:18:22.268 --> 00:18:25.146 position:50% align:center
so I can totally hang out with
you before our festival date!

00:18:25.230 --> 00:18:26.690 position:50% align:center
Our date?

00:18:26.773 --> 00:18:28.149 position:50% align:center
[MIRIO] That's when two
people who like each other

00:18:28.233 --> 00:18:29.150 position:50% align:center
spend time together.

00:18:29.234 --> 00:18:31.736 position:50% align:center
[ERI]
So, we're going on a date?

00:18:31.820 --> 00:18:34.447 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Maybe that's enough for today.

00:18:36.324 --> 00:18:38.618 position:50% align:center
Chief! C'mere, you need
to see this post!

00:18:38.702 --> 00:18:41.621 position:50% align:center
It's a new video
from you-know-who.

00:18:41.705 --> 00:18:44.916 position:50% align:center
Woof, we still haven't found
a single clue yet, right?

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:47.711 position:50% align:center
Let's find out where he
uploaded this video from.

00:18:47.794 --> 00:18:50.463 position:50% align:center
We've tried, but he's way too
good at covering his tracks.

00:18:50.547 --> 00:18:52.090 position:50% align:center
No excuses, please.

00:18:52.173 --> 00:18:53.550 position:50% align:center
[STATION EMPLOYEE 81A]
Yes, sir!

00:18:53.633 --> 00:18:57.220 position:50% align:center
[GENTLE] Welcome, dearest
viewers. I bid you good day.

00:18:59.264 --> 00:19:01.683 position:50% align:center
[GENTLE]
Can you guess what I'm up to?

00:19:01.766 --> 00:19:05.061 position:50% align:center
Worry not, friends.
I'll show you.

00:19:05.145 --> 00:19:07.939 position:50% align:center
Hold on. Oh, no.

00:19:08.023 --> 00:19:11.735 position:50% align:center
It's you... The guy who's
all over that video site.

00:19:12.819 --> 00:19:14.446 position:50% align:center
[GENTLE] I hope you'll
pardon my rudeness,

00:19:14.529 --> 00:19:17.365 position:50% align:center
but I simply don't have
the time for idle chatter.

00:19:18.366 --> 00:19:20.785 position:50% align:center
Kindly put the cash
into this briefcase.

00:19:20.869 --> 00:19:23.997 position:50% align:center
Before those worthless heroes
decide to show themselves.

00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:25.123 position:50% align:center
Please.

00:19:25.206 --> 00:19:27.417 position:50% align:center
[CLERK 81A]
U-Uh. Yeah, okay.

00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:29.169 position:50% align:center
[GENTLE] Oh, and it
would be ever so lovely

00:19:29.252 --> 00:19:32.047 position:50% align:center
if you could put the bills
in stacks of ten.

00:19:32.130 --> 00:19:34.049 position:50% align:center
Sure. Of course.

00:19:37.385 --> 00:19:39.137 position:50% align:center
[GENTLE]
Much obliged.

00:19:39.220 --> 00:19:41.639 position:50% align:center
[tires squealing]

00:19:41.723 --> 00:19:43.308 position:50% align:center
[HERO 81A]
Drop your weapon!

00:19:43.391 --> 00:19:46.227 position:50% align:center
[LA BRAVA] This is bad, Gentle!
There are two heroes!

00:19:46.311 --> 00:19:47.562 position:50% align:center
Will you be all right?

00:19:47.645 --> 00:19:51.941 position:50% align:center
[GENTLE laughs]
Calm yourself, La Brava.

00:19:52.025 --> 00:19:54.319 position:50% align:center
Do you think a duo
of dodgy do-gooders

00:19:54.402 --> 00:19:56.821 position:50% align:center
could hope to stop me?

00:19:56.905 --> 00:19:58.865 position:50% align:center
[HEROES]
Drop your weapon!

00:19:58.948 --> 00:20:00.450 position:50% align:center
[GENTLE]
Uh...

00:20:02.243 --> 00:20:05.330 position:50% align:center
[HERO 81A] Smart move.
Now, the briefcase.

00:20:05.413 --> 00:20:07.207 position:50% align:center
[GENTLE]
La Brava.

00:20:07.290 --> 00:20:10.210 position:50% align:center
[LA BRAVA] Don't worry,
I've got you covered!

00:20:10.293 --> 00:20:12.921 position:50% align:center
Cut to black, if you please.

00:20:18.301 --> 00:20:20.637 position:50% align:center
Post haste, my darling girl.

00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:24.307 position:50% align:center
[LA BRAVA] We can't leave yet!
You forgot the cash!

00:20:24.391 --> 00:20:26.643 position:50% align:center
[GENTLE]
Pish tosh, La Brava.

00:20:26.726 --> 00:20:29.312 position:50% align:center
I'm merely paying
the appearance fee.

00:20:29.396 --> 00:20:32.023 position:50% align:center
[GENTLE laughs]

00:20:32.107 --> 00:20:34.150 position:50% align:center
[GENTLE]
Money is not the goal.

00:20:34.234 --> 00:20:38.071 position:50% align:center
Rather to write my name
in the annuls of history!

00:20:38.154 --> 00:20:40.407 position:50% align:center
Yes! For 'tis I...

00:20:40.490 --> 00:20:45.078 position:50% align:center
I, Gentle! Gentle Criminal,
at your service.

00:20:45.161 --> 00:20:49.416 position:50% align:center
And now, dear viewers,
I must say cheerio.

00:20:49.499 --> 00:20:52.210 position:50% align:center
Until next time.

00:20:52.293 --> 00:20:56.506 position:50% align:center
Gentle Video. See you next time!

00:20:58.717 --> 00:21:00.885 position:50% align:center
[STATION EMPLOYEE 81A] These
are becoming more elaborate.

00:21:00.969 --> 00:21:03.096 position:50% align:center
Going by "Gentle Criminal," huh?

00:21:03.179 --> 00:21:06.975 position:50% align:center
Think this guy is serious,
or is it all a joke?

00:21:07.058 --> 00:21:09.269 position:50% align:center
It's impossible to tell.

00:21:11.479 --> 00:21:13.565 position:50% align:center
[LA BRAVA]
Oh, man, Gentle!

00:21:13.648 --> 00:21:16.192 position:50% align:center
[GENTLE]
What is troubling you, La Brava?

00:21:16.276 --> 00:21:18.820 position:50% align:center
[LA BRAVA] We're not getting
many views on the new video!

00:21:18.903 --> 00:21:21.823 position:50% align:center
Even though you were absolutely,
undeniably, wonderful today.

00:21:21.906 --> 00:21:23.950 position:50% align:center
I just don't get it!

00:21:24.034 --> 00:21:25.577 position:50% align:center
[GENTLE]
As I thought...

00:21:25.660 --> 00:21:26.786 position:50% align:center
To go down in history,

00:21:26.870 --> 00:21:29.831 position:50% align:center
I will need to accomplish
greater feats.

00:21:29.914 --> 00:21:33.543 position:50% align:center
It is time for a
proper spectacle.

00:21:33.626 --> 00:21:38.089 position:50% align:center
The question, of course,
is what will it be.

00:21:38.173 --> 00:21:39.424 position:50% align:center
Hot!

00:21:39.507 --> 00:21:42.802 position:50% align:center
[GENTLE] We must leave the
entire world gobsmacked.

00:21:42.886 --> 00:21:48.516 position:50% align:center
Impact is key. I need a scheme
that no soul can ignore.

00:21:48.600 --> 00:21:52.854 position:50% align:center
Fret not. I will settle on
something quite perfect.

00:21:52.937 --> 00:21:56.566 position:50% align:center
Of that, I'm sure.

00:21:56.649 --> 00:21:57.942 position:50% align:center
Hot!

00:23:29.284 --> 00:23:30.577 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Here's the preview!

00:23:30.660 --> 00:23:32.787 position:50% align:center
For the school festival,
we'll be putting on a show

00:23:32.871 --> 00:23:34.414 position:50% align:center
that combines a live
band performance

00:23:34.497 --> 00:23:35.915 position:50% align:center
with tons of dancing.

00:23:35.999 --> 00:23:38.668 position:50% align:center
But first, we have to decide
what everyone's going to do.

00:23:38.752 --> 00:23:41.212 position:50% align:center
And of course there's the
choreography and costumes,

00:23:41.296 --> 00:23:42.422 position:50% align:center
and all the other
elements that'll make

00:23:42.505 --> 00:23:44.215 position:50% align:center
everyone at UA smile!

00:23:44.299 --> 00:23:45.467 position:50% align:center
But elsewhere,

00:23:45.550 --> 00:23:48.053 position:50% align:center
Gentle Criminal fixes
his gaze on our school,

00:23:48.136 --> 00:23:50.096 position:50% align:center
threatening our hard work.

00:23:50.180 --> 00:23:52.432 position:50% align:center
Next time: "Prepping
for the School Festival

00:23:52.515 --> 00:23:54.893 position:50% align:center
Is the Most Fun Part."

00:23:54.976 --> 00:23:57.896 position:50% align:center
Go beyond! Plus Ultra!
