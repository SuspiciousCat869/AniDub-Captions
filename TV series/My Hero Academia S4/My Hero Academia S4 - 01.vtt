[IZUKU] Is it possible to become
a hero if I don't have a Quirk?

00:00:12.762 --> 00:00:14.055 position:50% align:center
Young man.

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:16.099 position:50% align:center
You, too, can become a hero.

00:00:16.182 --> 00:00:18.351 position:50% align:center
I can transfer my
Quirk to someone else.

00:00:18.435 --> 00:00:21.604 position:50% align:center
And that's just one facet
of my secret abilities.

00:00:21.688 --> 00:00:25.400 position:50% align:center
The name of my power
is One For All.

00:00:25.483 --> 00:00:27.610 position:50% align:center
One person improves the power,

00:00:27.694 --> 00:00:29.571 position:50% align:center
then hands it off
to another person.

00:00:29.654 --> 00:00:32.490 position:50% align:center
It continues to grow
as it's passed along.

00:00:32.574 --> 00:00:34.617 position:50% align:center
It is this cultivated
power that allows me

00:00:34.701 --> 00:00:37.120 position:50% align:center
to save those who are
in need of a hero.

00:00:37.203 --> 00:00:39.456 position:50% align:center
The truth behind my strength.

00:00:39.539 --> 00:00:41.041 position:50% align:center
And you're next.

00:00:43.209 --> 00:00:45.503 position:50% align:center
[ALL MIGHT]
I can give you my abilities.

00:00:49.257 --> 00:00:51.760 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] This world is
a superhuman society,

00:00:51.843 --> 00:00:54.220 position:50% align:center
with about 80 percent of
the population possessing

00:00:54.304 --> 00:00:57.140 position:50% align:center
some uncanny ability
called a "Quirk."

00:00:57.223 --> 00:00:59.351 position:50% align:center
Heroes fight against
villains who abuse

00:00:59.434 --> 00:01:00.769 position:50% align:center
their powers for evil.

00:01:00.852 --> 00:01:04.481 position:50% align:center
It's no surprise the heroes
became our champions.

00:01:10.362 --> 00:01:12.280 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
My name is Izuku Midoriya,

00:01:12.364 --> 00:01:15.033 position:50% align:center
and I've always dreamed
of being a hero.

00:01:15.116 --> 00:01:19.621 position:50% align:center
So I enrolled in the
prestigious UA High School.

00:01:19.704 --> 00:01:21.164 position:50% align:center
My friends and I
are working hard

00:01:21.247 --> 00:01:22.624 position:50% align:center
toward a shared goal.

00:01:22.707 --> 00:01:25.168 position:50% align:center
Facing every challenge
that comes our way,

00:01:25.251 --> 00:01:27.796 position:50% align:center
and saving people with a smile.

00:01:30.131 --> 00:01:33.510 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] We're training to become
the world's greatest heroes.

00:01:33.593 --> 00:01:38.556 position:50% align:center
That's right.
This is <i>My Hero Academia</i> .

[ALL FOR ONE]
Still weak, though.

00:03:13.026 --> 00:03:16.237 position:50% align:center
[ALL MIGHT] That's because
I didn't put my back

00:03:16.321 --> 00:03:18.239 position:50% align:center
into it that time!

00:03:33.588 --> 00:03:36.257 position:50% align:center
I can't believe we're never
gonna see him in action again.

back to work, fanboy?

Yes, ma'am!

[REPORTER 64B]
Hero name: All Might.

As a young man, his work
with genius scientist

00:03:46.267 --> 00:03:49.521 position:50% align:center

worldwide recognition.

00:03:49.604 --> 00:03:51.272 position:50% align:center
His meteoric rise continued

00:03:51.356 --> 00:03:53.650 position:50% align:center
after he returned to Japan,
until he became known

00:03:53.733 --> 00:03:55.777 position:50% align:center
as the number one hero

looking for the same

00:04:01.408 --> 00:04:02.450 position:50% align:center

haven't exactly

00:04:10.166 --> 00:04:11.710 position:50% align:center
been forthcoming with the press.

Are you a journalist or not?

00:04:13.878 --> 00:04:16.589 position:50% align:center
What do you have on that villain
he fought in his last battle?

00:04:16.673 --> 00:04:19.092 position:50% align:center
The police aren't releasing
any information about him.

00:04:19.175 --> 00:04:20.760 position:50% align:center
All I know is that
he's the mastermind

00:04:20.844 --> 00:04:22.637 position:50% align:center
behind the League of Villains.

00:04:22.721 --> 00:04:24.556 position:50% align:center
The story won't just
fall in your lap!

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:26.474 position:50% align:center
You have to get out there
and chase it down.

00:04:26.558 --> 00:04:28.476 position:50% align:center
[TOKUDA]
Am I interrupting?

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:31.438 position:50% align:center
Anger's really not a good
look on you, Chief.

00:04:31.521 --> 00:04:34.441 position:50% align:center
Now, come on. Give us a smile.

00:04:36.317 --> 00:04:38.570 position:50% align:center
Well, look who's
here. Hey, Tane.

00:04:38.653 --> 00:04:39.988 position:50% align:center
[TOKUDA]
Long time no see.

00:04:40.071 --> 00:04:42.699 position:50% align:center
Sounds like you're
looking for a story.

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:48.413 position:50% align:center
[ALL MIGHT]
Now, it's your turn.

00:04:48.496 --> 00:04:49.748 position:50% align:center
[TOKUDA]
Quite a statement.

00:04:49.831 --> 00:04:51.916 position:50% align:center
But what do you
suppose he meant by it?

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.211 position:50% align:center
I figured it was a warning.
You know, to the other villains.

00:04:55.295 --> 00:04:57.380 position:50% align:center
"I got your boss,
now I'm after you."

00:04:57.464 --> 00:04:58.673 position:50% align:center
If that were the case, though,

00:04:58.757 --> 00:05:00.508 position:50% align:center
wouldn't he have
said it differently?

00:05:00.592 --> 00:05:03.011 position:50% align:center
"You bastards are
next on my list."

00:05:03.094 --> 00:05:06.097 position:50% align:center
Or something more
along those lines.

00:05:06.181 --> 00:05:08.016 position:50% align:center
What are you suggesting, here?

00:05:08.099 --> 00:05:10.685 position:50% align:center
[TOKUDA] Four months ago,
All Might took a position

00:05:10.769 --> 00:05:13.813 position:50% align:center
as a teacher at UA High,
knowing he was reaching

00:05:13.897 --> 00:05:15.648 position:50% align:center
the end of his time as a hero.

00:05:15.732 --> 00:05:18.485 position:50% align:center
Then he ends his last
battle with the message,

00:05:18.568 --> 00:05:21.196 position:50% align:center
"Now, it's your turn."

00:05:21.279 --> 00:05:22.614 position:50% align:center
So, you think...?

00:05:22.697 --> 00:05:24.074 position:50% align:center
That's right.

00:05:24.157 --> 00:05:27.118 position:50% align:center
He's been assessing the next
generation of UA students,

00:05:27.202 --> 00:05:30.121 position:50% align:center
hoping he can find
a successor among them.

00:05:30.205 --> 00:05:33.750 position:50% align:center
And, considering how
he phrased his message,

00:05:33.833 --> 00:05:36.878 position:50% align:center
I believe he's already
selected one.

00:05:38.838 --> 00:05:40.006 position:50% align:center
That's why you're here.

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:42.425 position:50% align:center
You have an idea
of who it might be.

00:05:42.509 --> 00:05:44.344 position:50% align:center
[TOKUDA] At first,
I thought it was one of UA's

00:05:44.427 --> 00:05:48.515 position:50% align:center
Big Three: Third year,
Mirio Togata.

00:05:48.598 --> 00:05:50.475 position:50% align:center
He pays regular
visits to the agency

00:05:50.558 --> 00:05:54.521 position:50% align:center
run by Sir Nighteye,
All Might's former sidekick.

00:05:54.604 --> 00:05:56.231 position:50% align:center
You're right,
maybe he's our guy.

00:05:56.314 --> 00:05:58.149 position:50% align:center
[TOKUDA] However,
it appears that All Might

00:05:58.233 --> 00:06:00.527 position:50% align:center
and Sir Nighteye
have parted ways.

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:03.947 position:50% align:center
They no longer seem to be
in contact with one another.

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:05.573 position:50% align:center
[EDITOR-IN-CHIEF]
Could be misdirection.

00:06:05.657 --> 00:06:07.158 position:50% align:center
[TOKUDA]
Possible.

00:06:07.242 --> 00:06:10.662 position:50% align:center
But I've actually been kicking
around another theory.

00:06:10.745 --> 00:06:12.872 position:50% align:center
From what I hear,
All Might's been spending

00:06:12.956 --> 00:06:16.751 position:50% align:center
an unusual amount of his time
with the students in Class 1-A.

00:06:16.835 --> 00:06:18.795 position:50% align:center
[EDITOR-IN-CHIEF]
Interesting.

00:06:18.878 --> 00:06:20.088 position:50% align:center
You think that
All Might's chosen

00:06:20.171 --> 00:06:22.257 position:50% align:center
one of them to be his successor?

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:25.510 position:50% align:center
[TOKUDA] I believe that
to be the case, yes.

00:06:25.593 --> 00:06:28.346 position:50% align:center
But... those League
of Villains attacks

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:32.100 position:50% align:center
have UA pretty spooked.
Security's considerably tighter.

00:06:32.183 --> 00:06:34.352 position:50% align:center
A freelance journalist
like myself would have

00:06:34.436 --> 00:06:37.147 position:50% align:center
quite a difficult time gaining
entrance to the campus.

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:39.357 position:50% align:center
[EDITOR-IN-CHIEF]
Yeah, yeah, I get it.

00:06:39.441 --> 00:06:41.484 position:50% align:center
We'll get you access
to the school.

00:06:41.568 --> 00:06:43.194 position:50% align:center
And in return...

00:06:43.278 --> 00:06:45.030 position:50% align:center
And in return...

00:06:45.113 --> 00:06:48.491 position:50% align:center
I'll provide your paper
with an exclusive scoop.

00:06:48.575 --> 00:06:50.785 position:50% align:center
For a substantial

00:06:56.791 --> 00:06:58.168 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:06:58.251 --> 00:07:00.545 position:50% align:center
They wanna do a feature on

00:07:05.091 --> 00:07:06.593 position:50% align:center
That's kinda surprising, huh?

00:07:06.676 --> 00:07:07.844 position:50% align:center
Uh, not really.

00:07:07.927 --> 00:07:11.139 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I mean, the
sports festival was on TV.

[HAGAKURE]
We've gotta look super cute

00:07:12.515 --> 00:07:13.850 position:50% align:center
in case they wanna
take our picture.

00:07:13.933 --> 00:07:14.976 position:50% align:center
For sure!

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:16.811 position:50% align:center
I think you'll be
just fine, Hagakure.

00:07:16.895 --> 00:07:18.146 position:50% align:center
That's enough.

00:07:18.229 --> 00:07:19.147 position:50% align:center

[AIZAWA]
It's nothing too exciting.

00:07:20.607 --> 00:07:22.150 position:50% align:center
The article's about
how you're settling in,

00:07:22.233 --> 00:07:24.944 position:50% align:center
adjusting to dorm life,
that kinda thing.

00:07:25.028 --> 00:07:27.405 position:50% align:center
Principal Nezu thought
it would be a good idea.

00:07:27.489 --> 00:07:29.074 position:50% align:center
This'll show your
parents and guardians

00:07:29.157 --> 00:07:30.158 position:50% align:center
that you're happy here.

00:07:30.241 --> 00:07:31.534 position:50% align:center
Maybe set a few
minds at rest...

00:07:31.618 --> 00:07:34.496 position:50% align:center
Newscasters are usually hot.
This is awesome, right?

00:07:34.579 --> 00:07:36.289 position:50% align:center

I expect you all to be
on your best behavior today.

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:48.843 position:50% align:center
[TOKUDA] Don't worry on
my account, Mr. Aizawa.

00:07:48.927 --> 00:07:51.304 position:50% align:center
I wanna get a feel for what
dorm life is really like,

00:07:51.388 --> 00:07:52.555 position:50% align:center
so there's no need
for them to act

00:07:52.639 --> 00:07:53.932 position:50% align:center
any differently than normal.

00:07:54.015 --> 00:07:56.851 position:50% align:center
[AIZAWA] I didn't say
you could come in yet.

00:07:56.935 --> 00:08:00.021 position:50% align:center
I was told I had
from 8AM until 6PM.

00:08:00.105 --> 00:08:02.315 position:50% align:center

Nice to meet you!

00:08:11.324 --> 00:08:14.828 position:50% align:center
Now, as I said, you don't
need to do anything special.

00:08:14.911 --> 00:08:17.539 position:50% align:center
Just go about your day
exactly as you normally would.

00:08:17.622 --> 00:08:19.833 position:50% align:center
The camera will do
most of the work.

00:08:19.916 --> 00:08:22.377 position:50% align:center
I might ask an occasional
question or two,

00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:24.879 position:50% align:center
and I hope you'll answer.

00:08:24.963 --> 00:08:27.298 position:50% align:center
[gasps] He's got
such a nice smile!

00:08:27.382 --> 00:08:29.050 position:50% align:center
That is so not a woman.

00:08:29.134 --> 00:08:30.593 position:50% align:center
[sighs] What to do?

00:08:30.677 --> 00:08:32.637 position:50% align:center
My sparkling personality
will undoubtedly

00:08:32.721 --> 00:08:34.806 position:50% align:center
draw the camera like
a moth to a flame.

00:08:34.889 --> 00:08:36.599 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Undoubtedly.

00:08:36.683 --> 00:08:38.935 position:50% align:center
Principal Nezu has
probably already spoken

00:08:39.019 --> 00:08:40.937 position:50% align:center
to you about this,
but I wanna make sure

00:08:41.021 --> 00:08:43.231 position:50% align:center
you don't interfere
in any way. No offense--

00:08:43.314 --> 00:08:44.482 position:50% align:center
I understand.

00:08:44.566 --> 00:08:46.401 position:50% align:center
If you need anything,
just let me know.

00:08:46.484 --> 00:08:48.737 position:50% align:center
I'm sure I'm in
very capable hands.

00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:51.364 position:50% align:center
This is Class 1-A, after all.

00:08:51.448 --> 00:08:54.659 position:50% align:center
Every student here is
a promising hero candidate.

00:08:54.743 --> 00:08:58.663 position:50% align:center
Iida, if there's a problem,
let me know immediately. Got it?

00:08:58.747 --> 00:08:59.914 position:50% align:center
Of course, sir!

00:08:59.998 --> 00:09:01.916 position:50% align:center
As class representative,
I will carry out my duty

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:03.043 position:50% align:center
to ensure the safety of all

00:09:03.126 --> 00:09:04.127 position:50% align:center
my fellow students,
no matter wh--

00:09:04.210 --> 00:09:05.628 position:50% align:center
That's great, thanks.

00:09:05.712 --> 00:09:09.299 position:50% align:center
So, what would you normally
be doing this time of day?

00:09:09.382 --> 00:09:10.425 position:50% align:center
[TENYA]
Having breakfast!

00:09:10.508 --> 00:09:12.135 position:50% align:center
No need to be so formal.

00:09:12.218 --> 00:09:13.511 position:50% align:center
Just pretend that
I'm not here...

00:09:13.595 --> 00:09:16.556 position:50% align:center
[AIZAWA] I can tell this
reporter is up to something.

00:09:16.639 --> 00:09:18.767 position:50% align:center
Doesn't feel criminal, though.

00:09:18.850 --> 00:09:20.977 position:50% align:center
I'll leave him to it for now.

00:09:56.137 --> 00:09:58.264 position:50% align:center
[TOKUDA]
Seat number one is Yuga Aoyama.

00:09:58.348 --> 00:10:01.226 position:50% align:center
His Quirk allows him to shoot
a laser from his stomach.

00:10:01.309 --> 00:10:03.103 position:50% align:center
Number two, Mina Ashido.

00:10:03.186 --> 00:10:06.272 position:50% align:center
She secretes a highly
corrosive acid from her body.

00:10:06.356 --> 00:10:08.149 position:50% align:center
Number three is Tsuyu Asui,

00:10:08.233 --> 00:10:12.195 position:50% align:center
whose Quirk gives her the
characteristics of a frog.

00:10:12.278 --> 00:10:14.030 position:50% align:center
Seat four is Tenya Iida,

00:10:14.114 --> 00:10:16.408 position:50% align:center
the younger son in
the Iida hero family.

00:10:16.491 --> 00:10:18.827 position:50% align:center
He can move incredibly quickly.

00:10:21.246 --> 00:10:23.581 position:50% align:center
[TOKUDA]
Ochaco Uraraka is in seat five.

00:10:23.665 --> 00:10:27.085 position:50% align:center
Anything she touches
can become weightless.

00:10:27.168 --> 00:10:29.379 position:50% align:center
Number six, Mashirao Ojiro.

00:10:29.462 --> 00:10:32.507 position:50% align:center
His Quirk has given him
a powerful prehensile tail.

00:10:35.010 --> 00:10:37.220 position:50% align:center
[TOKUDA]
Seat seven is Denki Kaminari.

00:10:37.303 --> 00:10:40.098 position:50% align:center
He can store electricity
in his body and discharge it.

00:10:40.181 --> 00:10:42.225 position:50% align:center
Number eight, Eijiro Kirishima.

00:10:42.308 --> 00:10:45.020 position:50% align:center
His Quirk lets him
harden his whole physique.

00:10:47.647 --> 00:10:50.400 position:50% align:center
[TOKUDA] Koji Koda is in seat
nine and has the ability

00:10:50.483 --> 00:10:51.985 position:50% align:center
to control fauna.

00:10:52.068 --> 00:10:54.195 position:50% align:center
Rikido Sato, number ten.

00:10:54.279 --> 00:10:57.323 position:50% align:center
His Quirk changes sugar
into immense power.

00:11:02.203 --> 00:11:04.664 position:50% align:center
[TOKUDA] Seat 11 is Mezo
Shoji, who can manifest

00:11:04.748 --> 00:11:08.126 position:50% align:center
things like eyes, mouths, and
ears at the tips of his arms.

00:11:08.209 --> 00:11:10.545 position:50% align:center
And number 12,
Kyoka Jiro can use

00:11:10.628 --> 00:11:12.672 position:50% align:center
the plugs on her ears
to hear quiet sounds,

00:11:12.756 --> 00:11:15.717 position:50% align:center
as well as release
powerful sonic blasts.

00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:18.762 position:50% align:center
[DARK SHADOW] A large curry
and five <i>yakisoba</i> bowls!

00:11:21.723 --> 00:11:22.766 position:50% align:center
Thanks for waiting.

00:11:22.849 --> 00:11:24.726 position:50% align:center

monster named Dark Shadow.

00:11:37.197 --> 00:11:39.574 position:50% align:center
[TOKUDA]
Shoto Todoroki sits in seat 15.

00:11:39.657 --> 00:11:42.869 position:50% align:center
He blasts ice from his right
side and fire from his left.

00:11:44.829 --> 00:11:47.165 position:50% align:center
[TOKUDA]
Seat 16, Toru Hagakure.

00:11:47.248 --> 00:11:48.750 position:50% align:center
Her Quirk's invisibility.

00:11:48.833 --> 00:11:50.627 position:50% align:center
[KATSUKI]
Die!

00:11:51.836 --> 00:11:54.047 position:50% align:center
[TOKUDA]
Number 17, Katsuki Bakugo.

00:11:54.130 --> 00:11:56.049 position:50% align:center
The nitroglycerin-like
sweat on his palms

00:11:56.132 --> 00:11:57.884 position:50% align:center
causes explosions.

00:12:00.053 --> 00:12:02.222 position:50% align:center
[TOKUDA]
Izuku Midoriya is seat 18.

00:12:02.305 --> 00:12:07.018 position:50% align:center
His Quirk lets him increase
his physical abilities.

00:12:07.102 --> 00:12:09.437 position:50% align:center
Seat 19 is Minoru Mineta.

00:12:09.521 --> 00:12:11.898 position:50% align:center
The balls on his head
will stick to anything.

00:12:18.196 --> 00:12:20.740 position:50% align:center
[TOKUDA] Finally,
seat 20 is Momo Yaoyorozu,

00:12:20.824 --> 00:12:23.660 position:50% align:center
whose Quirk allows her to
create things with her body.

00:12:28.873 --> 00:12:29.958 position:50% align:center
[EDITOR-IN-CHIEF]
It took some schmoozing,

00:12:30.041 --> 00:12:31.418 position:50% align:center
but you're good to go.

00:12:31.501 --> 00:12:33.253 position:50% align:center
You've got permission
to talk to the class,

00:12:33.336 --> 00:12:35.296 position:50% align:center
but what's your plan
when you get there?

00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:37.465 position:50% align:center
[TOKUDA] I can narrow the
roster down if I think about

00:12:37.549 --> 00:12:40.385 position:50% align:center
who All Might would consider
worthy of his mantel.

00:12:40.468 --> 00:12:42.303 position:50% align:center
The most likely group
is the six who made it

00:12:42.387 --> 00:12:45.015 position:50% align:center
to the finals in
the sports festival.

00:12:45.098 --> 00:12:48.309 position:50% align:center
I'll start my investigation
by looking at them.

00:12:49.436 --> 00:12:51.771 position:50% align:center
[TOKUDA] Although, I think
I've got a good idea

00:12:51.855 --> 00:12:55.442 position:50% align:center
who it could be.
It's simple, really.

00:12:55.525 --> 00:12:57.569 position:50% align:center
Katsuki Bakugo's
abilities are certainly

00:12:57.652 --> 00:13:01.364 position:50% align:center
on par with those of pro heroes,
but in middle school he declared

00:13:01.448 --> 00:13:03.450 position:50% align:center
he would surpass All Might.

00:13:03.533 --> 00:13:07.454 position:50% align:center
That makes it difficult to
imagine him as the successor.

00:13:07.537 --> 00:13:11.374 position:50% align:center
Shoto Todoroki was the runner-up
at the sports festival.

00:13:11.458 --> 00:13:14.794 position:50% align:center
But his father is the
number-two hero, Endeavor.

00:13:14.878 --> 00:13:18.923 position:50% align:center
I don't see that man letting
his son surpass him.

00:13:19.007 --> 00:13:21.009 position:50% align:center
[TOKOYAMI]
Check, with the rook.

00:13:21.092 --> 00:13:22.427 position:50% align:center
[TOKUDA]
That leaves third-place winners

00:13:22.510 --> 00:13:25.472 position:50% align:center
Fumikage Tokoyami or Tenya Iida.

00:13:25.555 --> 00:13:29.559 position:50% align:center
Or maybe Eijiro Kirishima. No.

00:13:29.642 --> 00:13:31.353 position:50% align:center
I trust my instincts.

00:13:31.436 --> 00:13:33.938 position:50% align:center
They've gotten me many scoops.

00:13:34.022 --> 00:13:36.900 position:50% align:center
I think it's Izuku Midoriya.

00:13:40.570 --> 00:13:41.613 position:50% align:center
Hey.

00:13:41.696 --> 00:13:43.907 position:50% align:center
It's good to see you!

00:13:43.990 --> 00:13:46.034 position:50% align:center
[TOKUDA]
My gut says he's the one.

00:13:46.117 --> 00:13:48.995 position:50% align:center
He will be the next
Symbol of Peace.

00:13:56.836 --> 00:13:58.963 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] What have you been
up to out in this rain?

00:13:59.047 --> 00:14:01.424 position:50% align:center
[coughs] Nothin' much,
I just got back

00:14:01.508 --> 00:14:04.010 position:50% align:center
from a regular checkup
at the hospital.

00:14:04.094 --> 00:14:06.680 position:50% align:center
I was starving afterward,
so I stopped to grab a bite.

00:14:06.763 --> 00:14:09.432 position:50% align:center
Which turned into a whole thing.

00:14:09.516 --> 00:14:11.393 position:50% align:center
[EMPLOYEE 64A] I can't
believe you're in my store!

00:14:11.476 --> 00:14:12.977 position:50% align:center
You've inspired me
so much, All Might!

00:14:13.061 --> 00:14:14.104 position:50% align:center
Seriously, there's never

00:14:14.187 --> 00:14:16.022 position:50% align:center
gonna be another
Pro-hero like you!

00:14:16.106 --> 00:14:18.233 position:50% align:center
It's such a tragedy
that you retired.

00:14:18.316 --> 00:14:20.360 position:50% align:center
Are you hungry? Here,
take some meat buns.

00:14:20.443 --> 00:14:22.153 position:50% align:center
And this umbrella, too!

00:14:22.237 --> 00:14:23.822 position:50% align:center
Wow. Thanks!

00:14:25.532 --> 00:14:27.200 position:50% align:center
So, anyway.

00:14:27.283 --> 00:14:29.119 position:50% align:center
I brought the extra
buns for your class.

00:14:29.202 --> 00:14:32.539 position:50% align:center
Of course you did. Always
thinking of others, huh?

00:14:32.622 --> 00:14:34.040 position:50% align:center
With how popular you are,

00:14:34.124 --> 00:14:37.377 position:50% align:center
I'm surprised you're not
mobbed everywhere you go.

00:14:37.460 --> 00:14:39.295 position:50% align:center
As the number-one hero,
you brought hope

00:14:39.379 --> 00:14:42.048 position:50% align:center
and smiles to so
many people's lives.

00:14:42.132 --> 00:14:44.843 position:50% align:center
Protecting citizens and
fighting against evil villains.

00:14:44.926 --> 00:14:46.720 position:50% align:center
The Symbol of Peace.

00:14:48.805 --> 00:14:50.849 position:50% align:center
Now it's your turn.

00:14:50.932 --> 00:14:54.436 position:50% align:center
You and the rest of your class.

00:14:54.519 --> 00:14:56.104 position:50% align:center
Right.

00:14:56.187 --> 00:14:57.522 position:50% align:center
[ALL MIGHT] I'm getting
you back on an intense

00:14:57.605 --> 00:14:58.982 position:50% align:center
training regimen tomorrow.

00:14:59.065 --> 00:15:01.026 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Yes! I'm ready!

00:15:06.614 --> 00:15:10.744 position:50% align:center
Getting late. Squeezing
in one last workout?

00:15:10.827 --> 00:15:12.996 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Oh, uh, yes.

00:15:13.079 --> 00:15:16.166 position:50% align:center
[TOKUDA]
Huh. Something smells good.

00:15:16.249 --> 00:15:17.876 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Yeah. They're meat buns.

00:15:17.959 --> 00:15:19.044 position:50% align:center
Do you want one?

00:15:19.127 --> 00:15:20.587 position:50% align:center
Yes, please.

00:15:22.797 --> 00:15:24.049 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Whoa, really?

00:15:24.132 --> 00:15:26.718 position:50% align:center
So you're a huge All Might
fan, too, Mr. Tokuda?

00:15:26.801 --> 00:15:28.928 position:50% align:center
Ha. Anyone my age
who says they aren't

00:15:29.012 --> 00:15:32.098 position:50% align:center
is totally lying. That,
or they're criminals.

00:15:32.182 --> 00:15:34.351 position:50% align:center
I've never seen anyone so cool.

00:15:34.434 --> 00:15:36.770 position:50% align:center
Or so powerful.

00:15:36.853 --> 00:15:38.897 position:50% align:center
Do you know about the
bombing that took place

00:15:38.980 --> 00:15:41.399 position:50% align:center
at an industrial complex
18 years ago?

00:15:41.483 --> 00:15:43.193 position:50% align:center
Yeah, of course I do!

00:15:43.276 --> 00:15:44.986 position:50% align:center
It was really terrible,
but All Might managed

00:15:45.070 --> 00:15:47.030 position:50% align:center
to rescue the 24 people
who were working there

00:15:47.113 --> 00:15:48.698 position:50% align:center
when the explosion went off.

00:15:48.782 --> 00:15:50.283 position:50% align:center
My dad was one of them.

00:15:50.367 --> 00:15:52.494 position:50% align:center
All Might saved
my father's life.

00:15:52.577 --> 00:15:53.661 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:15:55.955 --> 00:15:57.374 position:50% align:center
[TOKUDA]
The blaze was so bad that even

00:15:57.457 --> 00:15:59.918 position:50% align:center
the rescue squads
couldn't get close.

00:16:00.001 --> 00:16:01.252 position:50% align:center
And yet...

00:16:01.336 --> 00:16:04.673 position:50% align:center
[ALL MIGHT] Fear not citizens.
Hope has arrived.

00:16:08.134 --> 00:16:11.137 position:50% align:center
Because I am here.

00:16:11.221 --> 00:16:14.015 position:50% align:center
Daddy!

00:16:14.099 --> 00:16:16.643 position:50% align:center
[TOKUDA] I turned my camera
on without thinking.

00:16:16.726 --> 00:16:20.313 position:50% align:center
And the picture I took
ended up in the paper.

00:16:20.397 --> 00:16:23.400 position:50% align:center
It seemed like a miracle
my father was rescued.

00:16:23.483 --> 00:16:26.528 position:50% align:center
Seeing All Might that night
brought a spark to my life.

00:16:26.611 --> 00:16:28.613 position:50% align:center
One that I still carry with me.

00:16:28.697 --> 00:16:30.907 position:50% align:center
Yeah. I get what you mean.

00:16:30.990 --> 00:16:33.284 position:50% align:center
Heh. So when I heard
he was retiring,

00:16:33.368 --> 00:16:35.286 position:50% align:center
I was completely shocked.

00:16:35.370 --> 00:16:37.247 position:50% align:center
What will happen to
our superhuman society

00:16:37.330 --> 00:16:40.875 position:50% align:center
in the future? Will we be okay?

00:16:40.959 --> 00:16:42.377 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
I understand.

00:16:42.460 --> 00:16:45.547 position:50% align:center
People are starting to worry
about what happens next.

00:16:45.630 --> 00:16:46.965 position:50% align:center
There's a feeling of unease

00:16:47.048 --> 00:16:50.427 position:50% align:center
that's starting to
permeate our world.

00:16:50.510 --> 00:16:53.221 position:50% align:center
This reporter feels it.

00:16:53.304 --> 00:16:56.266 position:50% align:center
I have to work
harder to make sure

00:16:56.349 --> 00:16:58.893 position:50% align:center
I use One For All
the best I can.

00:16:58.977 --> 00:16:59.853 position:50% align:center
[TOKUDA]
Midoriya?

00:16:59.936 --> 00:17:01.187 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Yes?

00:17:01.271 --> 00:17:02.522 position:50% align:center
[TOKUDA]
We still have hope.

00:17:02.605 --> 00:17:03.982 position:50% align:center
Uh--

00:17:05.442 --> 00:17:07.110 position:50% align:center
[TOKUDA]
It's your turn.

00:17:07.193 --> 00:17:08.486 position:50% align:center
What? A picture?

00:17:08.570 --> 00:17:10.238 position:50% align:center
But I don't see a camera!

00:17:10.321 --> 00:17:11.948 position:50% align:center
And, how'd you print it anyway?

00:17:12.032 --> 00:17:14.200 position:50% align:center
It turns out my Quirk
is a pretty handy one

00:17:14.284 --> 00:17:17.454 position:50% align:center
to have when you
work in journalism.

00:17:17.537 --> 00:17:20.165 position:50% align:center
Oh, look at that! So cool!

00:17:21.541 --> 00:17:22.334 position:50% align:center
Ah--

00:17:22.417 --> 00:17:25.628 position:50% align:center
I can produce them everywhere.

00:17:25.712 --> 00:17:27.630 position:50% align:center
[PRESENT MIC] Freelance
journalist, Taneo Tokuda.

00:17:27.714 --> 00:17:29.549 position:50% align:center
His Quirk: Whole-Body Lens!

00:17:29.632 --> 00:17:31.509 position:50% align:center
He can sprout lenses
anywhere on his body.

00:17:31.593 --> 00:17:33.553 position:50% align:center
He can even print pics
from his chest.

00:17:33.636 --> 00:17:36.848 position:50% align:center
No wonder he ends up
with so many scoops!

00:17:36.931 --> 00:17:38.767 position:50% align:center
Everybody heard
All Might's last words

00:17:38.850 --> 00:17:40.852 position:50% align:center
after the Kamino incident.

00:17:40.935 --> 00:17:43.605 position:50% align:center
[ALL MIGHT]
Now, it's your turn.

00:17:43.688 --> 00:17:47.442 position:50% align:center
[TOKUDA] And I think that
he was saying that to you.

00:17:47.525 --> 00:17:51.404 position:50% align:center
My investigation found plenty
of similarities between you two.

00:17:51.488 --> 00:17:54.491 position:50% align:center
The Quirk you manifested
is a power type like his.

00:17:54.574 --> 00:17:56.618 position:50% align:center
And in middle school,
you tried to rescue Bakugo

00:17:56.701 --> 00:17:59.996 position:50% align:center
when he was captured by
a villain, despite the odds.

00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:04.042 position:50% align:center
All Might was the one who
saved you both that day.

00:18:04.125 --> 00:18:05.877 position:50% align:center
And after you
enrolled at UA High

00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:09.130 position:50% align:center
at the same time,
he became a teacher here.

00:18:10.423 --> 00:18:12.842 position:50% align:center
[TOKUDA]
I visited the Pussycats' agency.

00:18:12.926 --> 00:18:14.427 position:50% align:center
I met Kota there.

00:18:14.511 --> 00:18:15.970 position:50% align:center
You talked to him?

00:18:16.054 --> 00:18:19.099 position:50% align:center
[TOKUDA] That's when my
suspicions were truly confirmed.

00:18:19.182 --> 00:18:23.937 position:50% align:center
Midoriya. I believe you
are All Might's successor.

00:18:25.563 --> 00:18:27.065 position:50% align:center
[TOKUDA]
What do you think about that?

00:18:27.148 --> 00:18:29.609 position:50% align:center
Oh. Well I, uh. The thing is...

00:18:29.693 --> 00:18:32.070 position:50% align:center
You can't lie, can ya?

00:18:32.153 --> 00:18:36.282 position:50% align:center
That's good. After all,
heroes speak the truth.

00:18:36.366 --> 00:18:38.410 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Huh?

00:18:38.493 --> 00:18:41.287 position:50% align:center
Hey, everyone. Dinner's
ready. It's time to eat.

00:18:41.371 --> 00:18:43.373 position:50% align:center
Gather together quickly.

00:18:43.456 --> 00:18:45.083 position:50% align:center
C'mon, Ochaco.

00:18:45.166 --> 00:18:48.128 position:50% align:center
I'll go see if Deku is
still outside training.

00:18:50.839 --> 00:18:53.425 position:50% align:center
[OCHACO] Huh. I wonder what
they're talking about.

00:18:53.508 --> 00:18:55.343 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
It's just that... I...

00:18:55.427 --> 00:18:57.470 position:50% align:center
You don't have to worry kid.

00:18:57.554 --> 00:19:02.350 position:50% align:center
I'm not writing an exposé,
even if I did have evidence.

00:19:02.434 --> 00:19:05.478 position:50% align:center
To be honest, I should probably
be apologizing to you.

00:19:05.562 --> 00:19:08.606 position:50% align:center
You see, I was never planning
to report on dorm life.

00:19:08.690 --> 00:19:09.482 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:19:09.566 --> 00:19:11.151 position:50% align:center
[TOKUDA]
I apologize.

00:19:11.234 --> 00:19:14.362 position:50% align:center
But... I just had to know.

00:19:14.446 --> 00:19:16.823 position:50% align:center
That there's still
light in this world.

00:19:16.906 --> 00:19:18.199 position:50% align:center
Mr. Tokuda.

00:19:18.283 --> 00:19:21.786 position:50% align:center
I feel better. After
our conversation here.

00:19:21.870 --> 00:19:23.747 position:50% align:center
And now I can encourage others.

00:19:23.830 --> 00:19:25.707 position:50% align:center
I won't be lying when
I write that there's still

00:19:25.790 --> 00:19:29.794 position:50% align:center
hope in the world, even if
All Might has retired.

00:19:29.878 --> 00:19:34.341 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry if I caused
you any stress. But...

00:19:34.424 --> 00:19:36.718 position:50% align:center
Thank you.

00:19:36.801 --> 00:19:38.094 position:50% align:center
Sure.

00:19:39.929 --> 00:19:41.806 position:50% align:center
[TOKUDA]
One more thing.

00:19:41.890 --> 00:19:43.433 position:50% align:center
--[IZUKU] Uh--!
--[OCHACO gasps]

00:19:46.353 --> 00:19:49.314 position:50% align:center
Um. That's weird.

00:19:49.397 --> 00:19:51.691 position:50% align:center
[TOKUDA]
I'm gonna cherish this picture.

00:19:51.775 --> 00:19:54.361 position:50% align:center
I'll keep it under
wraps until later.

00:19:54.444 --> 00:19:56.613 position:50% align:center
When I publish
my book about you.

00:19:56.696 --> 00:19:59.616 position:50% align:center
I think I even settled
on a good title.

00:19:59.699 --> 00:20:02.118 position:50% align:center
<i>When the New Symbol</i>
<i>of Peace Was Young</i> .

00:20:02.202 --> 00:20:03.828 position:50% align:center
What do ya think?

00:20:03.912 --> 00:20:05.121 position:50% align:center
I'll try my best.

00:20:05.205 --> 00:20:07.415 position:50% align:center
And I'll live up to that name.

00:20:07.499 --> 00:20:10.502 position:50% align:center
[TOKUDA]
I'm sure you will. Hero.

00:20:10.585 --> 00:20:11.961 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Thanks!

00:20:12.045 --> 00:20:14.589 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU] It was the end of
the time he'd been allotted,

00:20:14.673 --> 00:20:16.841 position:50% align:center
and Mr. Tokuda left
without telling anyone else

00:20:16.925 --> 00:20:18.468 position:50% align:center
in my class goodbye.

00:20:18.551 --> 00:20:20.428 position:50% align:center
After hearing what
he had to say,

00:20:20.512 --> 00:20:22.889 position:50% align:center
I once again felt just
how big a responsibility

00:20:22.972 --> 00:20:24.224 position:50% align:center
I'd inherited.

00:20:24.307 --> 00:20:26.393 position:50% align:center
But... Even so...

00:20:26.476 --> 00:20:28.645 position:50% align:center
Hey, Deku, are you on
your way in for dinner?

00:20:28.728 --> 00:20:31.064 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Oh, sorry. I'm coming.

00:20:31.147 --> 00:20:32.482 position:50% align:center
By the way.

00:20:32.565 --> 00:20:34.317 position:50% align:center
What was that reporter talking
to you about just now?

00:20:34.401 --> 00:20:37.028 position:50% align:center
Uh. Well. He was asking me...

00:20:37.112 --> 00:20:39.698 position:50% align:center
[sniffs] Something
smells super good.

00:20:39.781 --> 00:20:41.157 position:50% align:center
Uh, yeah.

00:20:41.241 --> 00:20:43.535 position:50% align:center
All Might brought by some
snacks for everyone earlier.

00:20:43.618 --> 00:20:44.911 position:50% align:center
I almost forgot about them.

00:20:44.994 --> 00:20:46.329 position:50% align:center
--What are they?
--[IZUKU] Meat buns.

00:20:46.413 --> 00:20:47.664 position:50% align:center
Seriously?

00:20:47.747 --> 00:20:49.582 position:50% align:center
Let's get 'em on the table
before they get cold!

00:20:49.666 --> 00:20:50.500 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Good idea.

00:20:50.583 --> 00:20:51.668 position:50% align:center
[OCHACO]
You guys!

00:20:51.751 --> 00:20:53.837 position:50% align:center
All Might got us
a yummy surprise!

00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:55.422 position:50% align:center
[STUDENTS]
Awesome!

00:20:57.132 --> 00:20:59.676 position:50% align:center
[EDITOR-IN-CHIEF]
There's my favorite reporter.

00:20:59.759 --> 00:21:01.094 position:50% align:center
So. Spill!

00:21:01.177 --> 00:21:03.555 position:50% align:center
Did you find out who All Might's
successor's gonna be?

00:21:03.638 --> 00:21:04.681 position:50% align:center
[TOKUDA]
Apologies.

00:21:04.764 --> 00:21:06.016 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
Huh?

00:21:06.099 --> 00:21:08.560 position:50% align:center
It turns out I jumped
to the wrong conclusions.

00:21:08.643 --> 00:21:10.687 position:50% align:center
[EDITOR-IN-CHIEF] So it was
a waste of time, then?

00:21:10.770 --> 00:21:12.647 position:50% align:center
Do you have any idea
how much begging

00:21:12.731 --> 00:21:14.441 position:50% align:center
I had to do to get
permission for you...

00:21:14.524 --> 00:21:16.735 position:50% align:center
[TOKUDA]
I'm very sorry about it, Chief.

00:21:16.818 --> 00:21:18.528 position:50% align:center
I know this doesn't
make up for it.

00:21:18.611 --> 00:21:20.613 position:50% align:center
But I didn't come
back empty handed.

00:21:20.697 --> 00:21:24.534 position:50% align:center
See, here's All Might buying
and eating a meat bun.

00:21:24.617 --> 00:21:26.745 position:50% align:center
[EDITOR-IN-CHIEF]
A candid! So cute!

00:21:26.828 --> 00:21:28.621 position:50% align:center
Well done! I never doubted you!

00:21:28.705 --> 00:21:29.956 position:50% align:center
You always pull through!

00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:32.000 position:50% align:center
Much obliged.

00:21:32.083 --> 00:21:33.168 position:50% align:center
[TOKUDA]
Sorry 'bout that...

00:21:33.251 --> 00:21:34.753 position:50% align:center
Ah-choo!

00:21:34.836 --> 00:21:36.129 position:50% align:center
[TOKUDA]
...All Might.

00:21:36.212 --> 00:21:39.174 position:50% align:center
[AIZAWA] A summer cold?
Better not get me sick.

00:21:39.257 --> 00:21:41.468 position:50% align:center
[ALL MIGHT]
Oh. Wouldn't dream of it.

00:21:42.802 --> 00:21:44.512 position:50% align:center
I'll be fine.

00:23:15.854 --> 00:23:17.355 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
The vague sense of unease from

00:23:17.439 --> 00:23:20.692 position:50% align:center
All Might's retirement
grew stronger.

00:23:20.775 --> 00:23:24.571 position:50% align:center
Soon, it would manifest
in ways we couldn't imagine

00:23:24.654 --> 00:23:27.490 position:50% align:center
and become something
truly terrifying.

00:23:29.576 --> 00:23:31.369 position:50% align:center
[IZUKU]
Here's the preview!

00:23:31.453 --> 00:23:33.538 position:50% align:center
As the students of Class 1-A
try to figure out

00:23:33.621 --> 00:23:35.665 position:50% align:center
where we'll do our work studies,

00:23:35.749 --> 00:23:37.375 position:50% align:center
the members of the
criminal underworld

00:23:37.459 --> 00:23:39.544 position:50% align:center
make moves of their own.

00:23:39.627 --> 00:23:41.880 position:50% align:center
A mysterious man meets
with the League of Villains

00:23:41.963 --> 00:23:44.132 position:50% align:center
led by Tomura Shigaraki.

00:23:44.215 --> 00:23:45.925 position:50% align:center
Is he there to join the group?

00:23:46.009 --> 00:23:48.845 position:50% align:center
Or does he have something
more sinister in mind?

00:23:48.928 --> 00:23:51.222 position:50% align:center
Next time: "Overhaul."

00:23:51.306 --> 00:23:54.601 position:50% align:center
The curtain rises on a new
trial for the heroes to face.

00:23:54.684 --> 00:23:57.228 position:50% align:center
Go beyond! Plus Ultra!
