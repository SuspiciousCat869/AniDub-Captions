1
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:31,375
So how's Eri doing?

2
00:01:31,458 --> 00:01:33,041
She still unconscious?

3
00:01:33,125 --> 00:01:34,708
Mm-hm.

4
00:01:34,791 --> 00:01:36,458
What do the doctors say?

5
00:01:36,541 --> 00:01:39,708
They called it
photosensi-something.

6
00:01:39,791 --> 00:01:41,250
I don't know...

7
00:01:41,333 --> 00:01:44,458
They talked like they thought
it was from gaming too much.

8
00:01:46,333 --> 00:01:47,625
So it should be
all right then...

9
00:01:47,708 --> 00:01:50,458
People recover from
this photo-whatever?

10
00:01:50,541 --> 00:01:54,000
But they say it usually
only takes a few hours.

11
00:01:54,083 --> 00:01:56,416
Then it's not super-serious...

12
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:59,666
She'll be awake and back to
normal before you know it.

13
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:06,791
Not this.

14
00:02:06,875 --> 00:02:08,125
This either...

15
00:02:09,666 --> 00:02:11,583
It's just no use...

16
00:02:11,666 --> 00:02:12,625
I need the list.

17
00:02:12,708 --> 00:02:14,500
Without it, I can't
see their data.

18
00:02:18,708 --> 00:02:23,375
Whatever else happened, I do
hope Sakuya didn't get PK'd.

19
00:02:23,458 --> 00:02:25,250
Wonder what she's like
in the real world--

20
00:02:25,333 --> 00:02:26,833
bet she's pretty cool...

21
00:02:26,916 --> 00:02:29,208
Wish I could meet the real her.

22
00:02:32,375 --> 00:02:33,583
Wait a minute.

23
00:02:33,666 --> 00:02:35,833
I hope the real "her"
isn't actually a "he".

24
00:02:42,083 --> 00:02:43,583
Lemme think...

25
00:02:43,666 --> 00:02:46,291
Cat-boy fell from up here, and
then a black hole opened up...

26
00:02:46,375 --> 00:02:48,125
We know that much.

27
00:02:48,208 --> 00:02:50,833
Either something's at the
other end of that hole...

28
00:02:50,916 --> 00:02:53,666
or our feline friend's
got himself a secret.

29
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:56,458
Guess I'll use process
of elimination.

30
00:03:01,083 --> 00:03:03,041
No communications
devices in the hospital.

31
00:03:03,125 --> 00:03:04,541
Please turn that off.

32
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:07,541
 Sorry.

33
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,875
Thank you very much, doctor.

34
00:03:10,958 --> 00:03:12,166
So what's the deal?

35
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:13,750
My hand's still a little numb,

36
00:03:13,833 --> 00:03:16,208
but they told me
it'll heal soon enough...

37
00:03:16,291 --> 00:03:18,875
They also said I needed
to stop gaming for a while.

38
00:03:18,958 --> 00:03:20,750
Oh, okay...

39
00:03:20,833 --> 00:03:22,041
Well, then...

40
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:24,000
Shall we?

41
00:03:25,916 --> 00:03:27,875
Hey, she's gone.

42
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:29,625
Did they release her?

43
00:03:29,708 --> 00:03:31,125
Sorry, 'scuse me...

44
00:03:31,208 --> 00:03:33,208
Where's the girl who was
in this bed earlier?

45
00:03:33,291 --> 00:03:34,708
Oh...

46
00:03:34,791 --> 00:03:36,958
they transferred her to a
different hospital this morning.

47
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,333
I knew it.

48
00:03:44,416 --> 00:03:45,208
What?

49
00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:46,375
Look at this right here...

50
00:03:46,458 --> 00:03:48,458
CC Corp.'s an investor.

51
00:03:50,333 --> 00:03:52,291
See, there's this rumor
going around about players

52
00:03:52,375 --> 00:03:54,125
who collapse in The World...

53
00:03:54,208 --> 00:03:56,791
Apparently, back in real life
they get put in hospitals

54
00:03:56,875 --> 00:03:59,166
that are quietly
controlled by CC Corp.

55
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:01,541
People are saying it might
be some sort of cover-up.

56
00:04:01,625 --> 00:04:02,750
Cover-up?

57
00:04:02,833 --> 00:04:03,958
Yeah...

58
00:04:04,041 --> 00:04:05,291
concealing the
connection between The World

59
00:04:05,375 --> 00:04:06,583
and these comas.

60
00:04:06,666 --> 00:04:07,666
Think about it.

61
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:09,041
Didn't you say
before you passed out,

62
00:04:09,125 --> 00:04:11,958
you touched Eri and your
real body got flung back?

63
00:04:12,041 --> 00:04:14,000
Um, yeah...

64
00:04:14,083 --> 00:04:15,208
Uh-huh...

65
00:04:15,291 --> 00:04:17,583
And I bet you touched
her with this hand.

66
00:04:20,583 --> 00:04:23,666
There's this freaky urban legend
I've heard about The World...

67
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:26,291
It's all about how people's
souls will get trapped inside

68
00:04:26,375 --> 00:04:28,750
the game, and their characters
keep walking around

69
00:04:28,833 --> 00:04:31,708
even though the players
themselves are unconscious.

70
00:04:31,791 --> 00:04:32,416
Stop.

71
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:33,208
I don't wanna hear it.

72
00:04:33,291 --> 00:04:34,291
You're freaking me out...

73
00:04:34,375 --> 00:04:35,625
It's just identity theft.

74
00:04:35,708 --> 00:04:37,250
Yeah, it's possible...

75
00:04:37,333 --> 00:04:38,500
but I doubt it.

76
00:04:38,583 --> 00:04:39,875
The things that have
been happening recently

77
00:04:39,958 --> 00:04:42,958
are disturbingly synchronized
with in-game events.

78
00:04:43,041 --> 00:04:45,250
And that random hospital
transfer--don't you think

79
00:04:45,333 --> 00:04:47,291
it's strange that she was
moved out of the city

80
00:04:47,375 --> 00:04:48,875
when the first place was newer?

81
00:04:48,958 --> 00:04:50,083
There was no reason for it.

82
00:04:50,166 --> 00:04:50,708
CC Corp.

83
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:51,583
must be beh--

84
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:52,083
Iori...

85
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:53,250
just stop!

86
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:58,041
If there's anything I can do
to help Eri, I want to...

87
00:04:58,125 --> 00:05:01,958
But I don't understand all
this conspiracy theory stuff.

88
00:05:02,041 --> 00:05:04,000
It scares me to think about.

89
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:10,458
An online game?

90
00:05:10,541 --> 00:05:13,041
Yeah, everybody says
it's really cool!

91
00:05:13,125 --> 00:05:15,000
Come on, you have
to play with me!

92
00:05:15,083 --> 00:05:15,833
No way...

93
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:17,166
Sounds pretty dorky.

94
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:18,416
So not my thing.

95
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:19,875
What?!

96
00:05:22,916 --> 00:05:23,958
Well, I'm here.

97
00:05:24,041 --> 00:05:25,000
Oh!

98
00:05:25,083 --> 00:05:26,083
Cool!

99
00:05:26,166 --> 00:05:28,041
You picked
a Black Rose type, huh...?

100
00:05:28,125 --> 00:05:30,166
I guess that
makes us partners!

101
00:05:31,458 --> 00:05:32,666
And who's this guy?

102
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:35,625
Oh right, this is my
other partner, Tobias...!

103
00:05:35,708 --> 00:05:37,666
We got to know each other
back when I first started

104
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:39,416
playing The World.

105
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,083
Nice to meet you.

106
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,625
Make sure you have
the right attributes...!

107
00:05:46,708 --> 00:05:48,333
I'll send him to you
with a Knockback Move,

108
00:05:48,416 --> 00:05:49,833
so make a skill attack!

109
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:51,541
Love to, but what
does that mean?

110
00:05:51,625 --> 00:05:53,208
Sakuya, behind you!

111
00:06:01,333 --> 00:06:02,500
Huh?

112
00:06:02,958 --> 00:06:04,333
Asumi?

113
00:06:09,625 --> 00:06:10,166
So...

114
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:11,291
what do you think?

115
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:15,083
What you said earlier...

116
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:18,000
Is Eri trapped in
The World somehow?

117
00:06:18,083 --> 00:06:19,166
I don't know...

118
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:21,500
but I sincerely hope she isn't.

119
00:06:24,458 --> 00:06:26,041
Because if she is...

120
00:06:26,125 --> 00:06:28,583
then I have no idea
what we can do about it...

121
00:06:28,666 --> 00:06:31,000
Not even the slightest clue.

122
00:06:35,791 --> 00:06:37,000
You want a ride?

123
00:06:37,083 --> 00:06:40,791
Nah, I feel bad always
making you drive me.

124
00:06:40,875 --> 00:06:42,333
But I was wondering...

125
00:06:42,416 --> 00:06:45,416
Would it be okay if I came over
after school's out tomorrow?

126
00:06:46,791 --> 00:06:48,958
It's just all that stuff
you were telling me...

127
00:06:49,041 --> 00:06:51,041
I can't bring myself
to believe it...

128
00:06:51,125 --> 00:06:53,250
it's still so scary...

129
00:06:53,333 --> 00:06:54,583
Anyway...

130
00:06:54,666 --> 00:06:58,208
If there's anything I can do
to help, I want to.

131
00:06:58,291 --> 00:06:59,833
I mean, it's up to us, isn't it?

132
00:06:59,916 --> 00:07:01,541
We're the only ones
who know what happened

133
00:07:01,625 --> 00:07:03,291
before she went into the coma.

134
00:07:04,375 --> 00:07:06,708
Hey, there's my customer!

135
00:07:06,791 --> 00:07:09,708
I brought that list,
as requested.

136
00:07:09,791 --> 00:07:11,291
Pretty much the
same as last time.

137
00:07:11,375 --> 00:07:13,916
Users with microchips
all documented...

138
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,416
Also...

139
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,375
I went ahead and added the users
who weren't around before.

140
00:07:17,458 --> 00:07:19,291
Thought you'd dig that.

141
00:07:19,375 --> 00:07:20,666
But password analysis

142
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:22,708
on two hundred thousand
people's data...?

143
00:07:22,791 --> 00:07:23,708
That's all you.

144
00:07:23,791 --> 00:07:25,416
Too boring for me, man.

145
00:07:26,541 --> 00:07:27,791
Thank you.

146
00:07:27,875 --> 00:07:29,750
What the heck are you
gonna use it for, anyway?

147
00:07:29,833 --> 00:07:31,458
It's secret.

148
00:07:31,541 --> 00:07:32,583
Hey...

149
00:07:32,666 --> 00:07:34,083
be careful not to
get caught, yeah...?

150
00:07:34,166 --> 00:07:36,166
I don't want you to
take me down with you.

151
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:37,666
Thanks for the warning.

152
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:49,000
This should do it
for the analysis.

153
00:07:49,083 --> 00:07:51,916
I can forget about the one
I lost at this point...

154
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,375
It's not like it can
be traced back to me.

155
00:07:56,166 --> 00:07:59,125
Guess I can go ahead and
add the ones who got PK'd.

156
00:08:03,166 --> 00:08:05,291
Kind of figured we'd be doing
more detective type stuff

157
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:06,500
in here.

158
00:08:06,583 --> 00:08:08,458
Precisely what we're
doing, dear Watson.

159
00:08:10,083 --> 00:08:11,875
Hey, look at your right hand.

160
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:15,166
I don't get it.

161
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:16,625
What's happening?

162
00:08:17,791 --> 00:08:19,625
My best guess is
it's got something to do

163
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:20,708
with the numbness.

164
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:22,458
We'll check it out later, okay?

165
00:08:22,541 --> 00:08:23,375
Yeah.

166
00:08:23,458 --> 00:08:24,416
All right...

167
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:25,875
This is where we
pick up the trail.

168
00:08:25,958 --> 00:08:27,291
Jump in, Sakuya.

169
00:08:29,291 --> 00:08:30,166
Here I go!

170
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:31,541
Cannonball!!

171
00:08:38,625 --> 00:08:40,208
So much for that.

172
00:08:43,125 --> 00:08:44,375
We can write it off

173
00:08:44,458 --> 00:08:46,166
as a warp hole, but where
does that leave us...?

174
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:47,208
This Hermit...

175
00:08:47,291 --> 00:08:49,500
I think he's involved somehow.

176
00:09:07,541 --> 00:09:09,791
What's happening to me?!

177
00:09:14,291 --> 00:09:15,666
What do think this is?

178
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:16,666
Some kinda scroll...

179
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:18,416
Do you know where you found it?

180
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,125
I have no idea.

181
00:09:23,625 --> 00:09:24,791
What the heck?

182
00:09:24,875 --> 00:09:25,708
It looks like...

183
00:09:25,791 --> 00:09:28,125
people's personal information!

184
00:09:30,708 --> 00:09:32,375
Iori, look at this!

185
00:09:33,833 --> 00:09:35,125
No way!

186
00:09:36,916 --> 00:09:38,291
What the hell is going on?

187
00:09:38,375 --> 00:09:40,291
This is nuts.

188
00:09:40,375 --> 00:09:42,083
Eri...

189
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:46,208
Masaya Asanuma...

190
00:09:46,291 --> 00:09:47,583
0 5 9...

191
00:09:47,666 --> 00:09:49,416
1 8 F D...

192
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,333
0 B C 2.

193
00:09:51,416 --> 00:09:53,041
Got it.

194
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:55,083
Koichi Matsubara.

195
00:09:55,166 --> 00:09:58,750
Phone number: 0 4 6 7 D 9 A...

196
00:09:58,833 --> 00:10:01,000
B C 1 A, You got all that?

197
00:10:01,083 --> 00:10:01,875
Uh-huh.

198
00:10:01,958 --> 00:10:03,791
Next up we have Kana Sugimoto...

199
00:10:03,875 --> 00:10:06,458
0 9 8 D A 1 2...

200
00:10:06,541 --> 00:10:08,250
B D C C.

201
00:10:09,291 --> 00:10:11,000
So...

202
00:10:11,083 --> 00:10:12,666
Do you think all
these people are players

203
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:14,416
who've slipped into comas?

204
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:15,791
That's the question...

205
00:10:15,875 --> 00:10:17,291
Time to start checking.

206
00:10:17,375 --> 00:10:18,541
What're you gonna do?

207
00:10:18,625 --> 00:10:20,125
Hit up my sources.

208
00:10:21,458 --> 00:10:22,166
Jeez...

209
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:24,458
they're all hospitalized.

210
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:25,833
And what's more, CC Corp.

211
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:28,416
is an investor in
all these hospitals...

212
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:31,666
Gotta say even I didn't
expect somethin' this big...

213
00:10:32,916 --> 00:10:34,625
Is this a good idea?

214
00:10:34,708 --> 00:10:35,791
What d'you mean.

215
00:10:35,875 --> 00:10:37,208
Just think...

216
00:10:37,291 --> 00:10:39,708
We're getting ourselves involved
in something major here!

217
00:10:39,791 --> 00:10:40,708
We should call the pol--

218
00:10:44,208 --> 00:10:45,250
Number's blocked.

219
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:50,250
And they sure are persistent.

220
00:10:54,958 --> 00:10:56,833
It's probably just one
of the families I talked to

221
00:10:56,916 --> 00:10:58,375
calling back.

222
00:11:03,333 --> 00:11:04,041
Land line?

223
00:11:04,125 --> 00:11:04,916
What?

224
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,125
Ikuta residence.

225
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:08,875
Just a second, please...

226
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:09,583
Iori!

227
00:11:09,666 --> 00:11:11,333
Phone!

228
00:11:12,708 --> 00:11:14,041
That moron.

229
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:15,958
Thank you for holding.

230
00:11:16,041 --> 00:11:17,208
May I help you?

231
00:11:17,291 --> 00:11:19,625
Is this Iori Ikuta?

232
00:11:19,708 --> 00:11:20,500
Well, that depends.

233
00:11:20,583 --> 00:11:21,541
Who is this?

234
00:11:21,625 --> 00:11:23,208
You just made
several phone calls.

235
00:11:23,291 --> 00:11:25,750
And every number
belonged to a Lost One...

236
00:11:25,833 --> 00:11:28,833
Eri Eto has only been
Lost for a week...

237
00:11:28,916 --> 00:11:30,916
How did you
figure it out so quickly?

238
00:11:32,083 --> 00:11:33,208
Tell me who you are...

239
00:11:33,291 --> 00:11:35,208
And how do you know about Eri?

240
00:11:35,291 --> 00:11:37,333
I'm conducting
an investigation.

241
00:11:37,416 --> 00:11:39,083
I don't mean you any harm...

242
00:11:39,166 --> 00:11:41,083
I'm going to send you
two tickets...

243
00:11:41,166 --> 00:11:43,833
I want you and your
other friend to come to Tokyo.

244
00:11:44,916 --> 00:11:48,000
I'll email details and
the exact location shortly.

245
00:11:54,708 --> 00:11:57,416
What in the world have
we gotten ourselves into?

246
00:12:10,375 --> 00:12:11,416
Who made this?

247
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:12,875
And what did they
plan to do with it?

248
00:12:12,958 --> 00:12:14,375
Sakuya!

249
00:12:21,916 --> 00:12:23,291
Oh, Hermit, hey!

250
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:25,208
You're okay, then!

251
00:12:25,291 --> 00:12:27,291
I've been looking
all over the place for you.

252
00:12:27,375 --> 00:12:28,333
Oh, really...?

253
00:12:28,416 --> 00:12:29,750
Sorry.

254
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:31,375
Is there something wrong?

255
00:12:32,375 --> 00:12:33,500
A Lost One?

256
00:12:33,583 --> 00:12:34,666
Yeah...

257
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:36,541
It was my friend who got PK'd.

258
00:12:36,625 --> 00:12:38,000
She was with us before...

259
00:12:38,083 --> 00:12:39,958
You know, Mary?

260
00:12:40,041 --> 00:12:42,833
I got a call from this
place called the NAB...

261
00:12:42,916 --> 00:12:45,208
they said it's been
happening a lot lately.

262
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:47,541
Well, that's it for me.

263
00:12:47,625 --> 00:12:48,916
I need some sleep.

264
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:49,500
Oh.

265
00:12:49,583 --> 00:12:50,500
But...

266
00:12:50,583 --> 00:12:51,958
you'll come again
tomorrow, right?

267
00:12:52,041 --> 00:12:53,208
I'm sorry...

268
00:12:53,291 --> 00:12:54,833
I've got somewhere to be.

269
00:12:56,166 --> 00:12:57,541
Bye for now!

270
00:13:05,083 --> 00:13:07,458
It's the only clue
we have so far!

271
00:13:07,541 --> 00:13:08,958
What else can we do?

272
00:13:09,041 --> 00:13:10,958
I'm just saying we need
to be a bit more careful.

273
00:13:11,041 --> 00:13:13,541
We don't know who was on the
other end of that phone call.

274
00:13:13,625 --> 00:13:15,625
It'll be okay if you
don't wanna come.

275
00:13:15,708 --> 00:13:17,625
I can go by myself.

276
00:13:17,708 --> 00:13:18,500
Don't be like that.

277
00:13:18,583 --> 00:13:20,166
I never said I wasn't going!

278
00:13:33,333 --> 00:13:34,833
Tokyo's huge...

279
00:13:34,916 --> 00:13:36,583
Look at all these people.

280
00:13:39,875 --> 00:13:40,458
It's this way.

281
00:13:40,541 --> 00:13:41,750
Let's go.

282
00:13:43,916 --> 00:13:46,458
Look, it's the U.N. University.

283
00:13:46,541 --> 00:13:48,083
"NAB investigator"?

284
00:13:48,166 --> 00:13:49,833
We'll see about that...

285
00:14:00,416 --> 00:14:01,416
Yes?

286
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:03,250
Both of you log in, please.

287
00:14:06,666 --> 00:14:08,291
Come to the far door.

288
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:20,750
Iori!

289
00:14:24,875 --> 00:14:28,083
There are certain problems that
are endemic to The World...

290
00:14:28,166 --> 00:14:29,375
What you see are players

291
00:14:29,458 --> 00:14:32,208
who fell into comas
because of those problems.

292
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:37,958
If you know so much,
why do you need us?

293
00:14:39,041 --> 00:14:42,041
Of course, the official position
is that current medical science

294
00:14:42,125 --> 00:14:44,708
cannot prove a link between
what happens in the game

295
00:14:44,791 --> 00:14:47,208
and the players'
subsequent comas.

296
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,750
Welcome to my sanctum.

297
00:14:55,833 --> 00:14:57,250
Hey wait, you're--

298
00:14:57,333 --> 00:14:59,541
I'm sorry about that
whole 'bounty' mix-up.

299
00:14:59,625 --> 00:15:00,166
It's all right.

300
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:01,416
I'm sorry, t--

301
00:15:02,958 --> 00:15:05,791
So you called us all the way
here just to show us that?

302
00:15:05,875 --> 00:15:08,125
Come now, no need to be cross.

303
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:13,083
The cause of these comas
lies within the game.

304
00:15:13,166 --> 00:15:16,583
And so too, does the means
to wake up the victims.

305
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:19,041
You'd better not be spinning
stories to get information

306
00:15:19,125 --> 00:15:19,750
out of us.

307
00:15:19,833 --> 00:15:21,083
It won't work.

308
00:15:21,166 --> 00:15:22,666
I'm not lying...

309
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:25,375
Perhaps it will set your mind at
ease to know that I was party

310
00:15:25,458 --> 00:15:27,500
to the 'incident'
five years ago.

311
00:15:29,083 --> 00:15:31,416
The tragic events of
Twenty-Seventeen were caused

312
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:33,250
by a powerful consciousness.

313
00:15:33,333 --> 00:15:35,875
And the Lost Ones could not
be revived until that threat

314
00:15:35,958 --> 00:15:37,541
was eliminated.

315
00:15:37,625 --> 00:15:39,583
But they did eventually
come back, then?

316
00:15:39,666 --> 00:15:40,666
Yes...

317
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:42,875
with some exceptions,
they returned...

318
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:44,500
Now...

319
00:15:44,583 --> 00:15:47,166
I'd like to know how the two of
you came upon your information

320
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:48,708
regarding the current Lost Ones.

321
00:15:48,791 --> 00:15:49,291
That's easy.

322
00:15:49,375 --> 00:15:50,458
Net Slum.

323
00:15:51,125 --> 00:15:52,416
I'm being honest with you.

324
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,458
Why can't you show me
the same courtesy?

325
00:15:54,541 --> 00:15:56,916
What's "honest" about
meeting in character...?

326
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,416
If you want us to be
straight with each other,

327
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,666
why don't you show us
who you really are?

328
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:02,583
I thought things would
be smoother this way,

329
00:16:02,666 --> 00:16:04,291
but perhaps I was wrong...

330
00:16:04,375 --> 00:16:05,583
Very well.

331
00:16:05,666 --> 00:16:07,458
Take off your FMDs.

332
00:16:10,916 --> 00:16:12,500
Pleasure to meet you.

333
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:18,125
As a matter of pride,
I'd like to clarify...

334
00:16:18,208 --> 00:16:21,041
That character in no way
reflects my normal style...

335
00:16:21,125 --> 00:16:22,916
Her appearance is
merely convenient for

336
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,416
my unrelated search
for a missing person.

337
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:26,666
Yeah, whatever.

338
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:29,291
Now will you answer
my question honestly?

339
00:16:29,375 --> 00:16:31,583
You told us about five years
ago, but you still haven't said

340
00:16:31,666 --> 00:16:34,041
anything about this incident.

341
00:16:34,125 --> 00:16:36,708
If I do, will you
tell me what you know?

342
00:16:36,791 --> 00:16:39,250
If we find your story
to be believable.

343
00:16:39,333 --> 00:16:41,375
But that could present
a problem, couldn't it?

344
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:44,666
What if I tell you the truth and
you don't find it believable?

345
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:45,833
Well...

346
00:16:45,916 --> 00:16:47,375
If it's the truth,
then we'll believe it.

347
00:16:47,458 --> 00:16:48,958
Shut up!

348
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:51,708
She seemed sketchy on
the phone and in her email...

349
00:16:51,791 --> 00:16:53,666
but we still came
here, didn't we?

350
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:55,000
Let's trust her.

351
00:16:56,583 --> 00:16:57,875
CC Corp.

352
00:16:57,958 --> 00:16:59,958
has had serious problems
ever since it first released

353
00:17:00,041 --> 00:17:01,208
The World...

354
00:17:01,291 --> 00:17:02,583
Those problems
have been exploited

355
00:17:02,666 --> 00:17:04,541
in any number of ways...

356
00:17:04,625 --> 00:17:06,083
In the end, however,

357
00:17:06,166 --> 00:17:09,041
they are rooted in the ideals
of one misguided researcher.

358
00:17:09,875 --> 00:17:12,958
He dreamt that he could free
humanity from the evil of racism

359
00:17:13,041 --> 00:17:15,875
by turning everybody
into a Lost One.

360
00:17:15,958 --> 00:17:17,541
That dream drove
his every action

361
00:17:17,625 --> 00:17:19,500
and spiraled out of control...

362
00:17:19,583 --> 00:17:21,000
Between the fire at CC Corp.

363
00:17:21,083 --> 00:17:24,250
in Twenty-Fifteen and his
subsequent lapse into a coma,

364
00:17:24,333 --> 00:17:26,416
the curtain closed
on the matter...

365
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:29,041
at least for the time being.

366
00:17:29,125 --> 00:17:31,250
However, an organization
exists committed

367
00:17:31,333 --> 00:17:33,416
to carrying on his research...

368
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:34,708
Their immediate objective is

369
00:17:34,791 --> 00:17:37,333
to gain control
of all the Lost Ones.

370
00:17:38,833 --> 00:17:41,166
They've already entered the
practical application stage

371
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:43,875
with people who never have
to come back to reality...

372
00:17:43,958 --> 00:17:45,458
They use people
whose disappearances

373
00:17:45,541 --> 00:17:47,208
won't cause problems.

374
00:17:50,916 --> 00:17:52,583
Astounding.

375
00:17:52,666 --> 00:17:55,333
This is literally
a record of his crimes...

376
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:57,666
Where'd you get this?

377
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:59,166
I'm not sure...

378
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:01,750
I pick stuff up without
looking at it all the time.

379
00:18:01,833 --> 00:18:03,166
I see...

380
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:05,666
All right, well I'll be
taking charge of this for now.

381
00:18:06,625 --> 00:18:09,791
If we can give the data a close
look, we may be able to identify

382
00:18:09,875 --> 00:18:12,500
who made the list through
quirks in his programming...

383
00:18:12,583 --> 00:18:14,708
For now, leave the
rest in our hands...

384
00:18:14,791 --> 00:18:17,708
And both of you stay
far away from The World.

385
00:18:17,791 --> 00:18:20,916
Smith'll facilitate
further communications.

386
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,375
Stop playing the game?

387
00:18:22,458 --> 00:18:23,958
But our investigation--

388
00:18:24,041 --> 00:18:27,208
For all we know, you nearly fell
into this criminal's clutches.

389
00:18:27,291 --> 00:18:28,500
Restrain yourselves until

390
00:18:28,583 --> 00:18:30,958
we know for certain
you aren't being targeted.

391
00:18:31,833 --> 00:18:33,000
I feel like I've been

392
00:18:33,083 --> 00:18:35,791
hit upside the head with
a blunt instrument...

393
00:18:35,875 --> 00:18:37,791
It's unsettling to have
someone prove to you you're

394
00:18:37,875 --> 00:18:40,500
a tiny fish in a big sea.

395
00:18:40,583 --> 00:18:41,916
C'mon, it's not that bad.

396
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,666
So she has a lot of information.

397
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:46,083
You still know
plenty of stuff I don't.

398
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:48,000
Well, that sure
isn't saying much.

399
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:52,250
Just teasin'...

400
00:18:52,333 --> 00:18:53,750
Thank you.

401
00:18:55,041 --> 00:18:57,458
Well, I'll be damned, boy.

402
00:18:57,541 --> 00:18:58,958
Do you see now?

403
00:18:59,041 --> 00:19:02,375
I want to cut them out of
the system and set them free.

404
00:19:02,458 --> 00:19:04,958
Dude, do you even
understand what this is?

405
00:19:05,041 --> 00:19:06,666
Huh-uh.

406
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:07,791
Look right here.

407
00:19:07,875 --> 00:19:09,166
Every single one of these babies

408
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:12,500
is fourteen billion
superposed qubits.

409
00:19:12,583 --> 00:19:14,541
Smart money says
the brains' synapses

410
00:19:14,625 --> 00:19:17,583
are bein' used for
qubit interactions...

411
00:19:17,666 --> 00:19:20,791
Quantum computers are just
plain amazin', y'ask me.

412
00:19:20,875 --> 00:19:21,916
Can you do it?

413
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,875
Easy as pie with
the ones on the ground.

414
00:19:23,958 --> 00:19:25,625
They'll disconnect for sure...

415
00:19:25,708 --> 00:19:28,875
The brains are parts now,
though, they may not make it...

416
00:19:28,958 --> 00:19:29,958
Ah, don't worry boy.

417
00:19:30,041 --> 00:19:31,916
I'll get 'em out
nice and clean for ya.

418
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:32,916
Hee-hee-hee!

419
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,583
This is gonna be good!

420
00:19:35,791 --> 00:19:37,250
Your friend in the coma...

421
00:19:37,333 --> 00:19:38,375
how is she doing?

422
00:19:38,458 --> 00:19:40,375
No change, unfortunately.

423
00:19:40,458 --> 00:19:42,166
I'm sorry...

424
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:44,833
We've gotten some results
I can share with you...

425
00:19:44,916 --> 00:19:46,541
I'll do my best to explain.

426
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:49,583
This list has been
constructed as a database

427
00:19:49,666 --> 00:19:51,083
of user haplotypes.

428
00:19:51,916 --> 00:19:52,666
Okay.

429
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:53,541
What are those?

430
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:55,000
To put it in simple terms,

431
00:19:55,083 --> 00:19:57,250
they're basically
genetic types...

432
00:19:57,333 --> 00:19:59,458
From the research we've done,
it looks as if the owner of

433
00:19:59,541 --> 00:20:01,750
the list was searching
The World for a donor

434
00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:03,875
to help a particular patient.

435
00:20:03,958 --> 00:20:07,000
Why look for this 'donor' in
The World instead of real life?

436
00:20:07,083 --> 00:20:08,291
No doubt exploiting the game's

437
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:10,958
vulnerabilities was the
more convenient route...

438
00:20:11,041 --> 00:20:14,000
Haplotype data is highly
sensitive private information,

439
00:20:14,083 --> 00:20:17,916
and as such is safeguarded by
extremely complex firewalls.

440
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,083
But if you were to use
social security numbers--

441
00:20:20,166 --> 00:20:22,000
Hold on a sec--the
government oversees

442
00:20:22,083 --> 00:20:23,958
our real-world identities.

443
00:20:24,041 --> 00:20:25,416
Whoever this person is,

444
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:28,375
how could he extract that
kind of data from the game?

445
00:20:28,458 --> 00:20:29,083
Here.

446
00:20:29,166 --> 00:20:30,291
Allow me to demonstrate.

447
00:20:33,416 --> 00:20:34,875
It's my list!

448
00:20:34,958 --> 00:20:36,958
We were able to determine the
list-maker's motive because

449
00:20:37,041 --> 00:20:39,458
the patient's ID is
in the database, too.

450
00:20:39,541 --> 00:20:40,708
He's an American citizen,

451
00:20:40,791 --> 00:20:42,916
so it did take us some
time to track him down.

452
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,625
But you found him, right?

453
00:20:44,708 --> 00:20:45,875
Yes.

454
00:20:45,958 --> 00:20:48,750
The intended recipient
is a Toha--Tanagami...

455
00:20:48,833 --> 00:20:50,750
He was in a hospital
in San Francisco

456
00:20:50,833 --> 00:20:53,375
awaiting treatment
until Twenty-Fifteen.

457
00:20:53,458 --> 00:20:54,791
You said "was".

458
00:20:54,875 --> 00:20:57,083
So he's already been released
from the hospital, then?

459
00:20:57,166 --> 00:20:58,250
No.

460
00:20:58,333 --> 00:20:59,583
He passed away...

461
00:20:59,666 --> 00:21:02,125
He's been dead seven years.

462
00:21:02,208 --> 00:21:05,333
Someone's looking for donors
for a person who died?

463
00:21:05,416 --> 00:21:07,916
That seems to be the case, yes.

464
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,625
But now we know the
reason behind all this.

465
00:21:10,708 --> 00:21:12,583
Whoever made the list
is stealing data from

466
00:21:12,666 --> 00:21:15,166
The World for Tanagami's sake.

467
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:16,625
Passed away?

468
00:21:16,708 --> 00:21:18,208
Seven years ago?

469
00:21:19,958 --> 00:21:22,083
He forcibly
extracts biological data

470
00:21:22,166 --> 00:21:24,000
from the owners of these IDs...

471
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:26,166
As a result,
they become Lost Ones.

472
00:21:27,666 --> 00:21:30,125
Sakuya, I need you
to tell me your password.

473
00:21:30,208 --> 00:21:31,458
Huh?!

474
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:32,958
What the crap?

475
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:34,833
I'm almost done with it, dude.

476
00:21:36,375 --> 00:21:38,708
All of this, and for nothing!

477
00:21:40,875 --> 00:21:42,666
Seven years, just wasted!

478
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:44,041
Man, what's up with you?!

479
00:21:52,208 --> 00:21:55,333
As long as a hacker has an
FMD and a modicum of skill...

480
00:21:55,416 --> 00:21:58,083
Implant chip security's
just not that tough to crack.

481
00:21:58,166 --> 00:21:59,583
That doesn't make sense!

482
00:21:59,666 --> 00:22:01,958
There's nothing more private
than internal microchips!

483
00:22:02,625 --> 00:22:05,125
What I've just shown you
proves that's not true.

484
00:22:07,416 --> 00:22:08,500
What's this?

485
00:22:08,583 --> 00:22:09,791
"Compatible"?

486
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:15,625
What's up?

487
00:22:48,208 --> 00:22:50,333
 Mistress!

488
00:22:50,416 --> 00:22:51,958
Attention Players:

489
00:22:52,041 --> 00:22:55,250
This field is about to be shut
down for server maintenance...

490
00:22:55,333 --> 00:22:58,041
What's happening?

491
00:22:58,125 --> 00:23:01,083
Again, this area
is shutting down...

492
00:23:01,166 --> 00:23:02,875
Please log out.

493
00:23:07,125 --> 00:23:08,291
They're eating people!

494
00:23:08,375 --> 00:23:09,791
This is insane!

495
00:23:09,875 --> 00:23:12,458
Mistress, from what I can tell,
the area's being hacked.

496
00:23:12,541 --> 00:23:13,833
Can you take care of it?

497
00:23:13,916 --> 00:23:15,250
I'll do what I can.

498
00:23:28,625 --> 00:23:29,625
Eri!

499
00:23:29,708 --> 00:23:30,375
What?

500
00:23:30,458 --> 00:23:31,208
Come back!

501
00:23:31,291 --> 00:23:32,125
Eri--!

502
00:23:33,791 --> 00:23:35,083
That hurt!

503
00:23:35,166 --> 00:23:35,750
It hurt?

504
00:23:35,833 --> 00:23:37,041
Log out now...!

505
00:23:37,125 --> 00:23:39,083
We're not in Mac Anu anymore!

506
00:23:47,916 --> 00:23:49,083
It's not working!

507
00:23:49,166 --> 00:23:51,250
Hey, what did you do to her?

508
00:23:51,333 --> 00:23:52,458
It's a Data Drain...

509
00:23:52,541 --> 00:23:54,458
but she's recovering
from it too quickly!

510
00:23:56,916 --> 00:23:57,583
Damn it...

511
00:23:57,666 --> 00:23:59,250
Get offline!

512
00:23:59,333 --> 00:24:02,250
If they PK you,
you'll become a Lost One!

513
00:24:02,333 --> 00:24:03,291
No, not yet!

514
00:24:03,375 --> 00:24:04,416
Eri's coming with us!

515
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:04,958
How?

516
00:24:05,041 --> 00:24:05,916
There's no way!

517
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:08,625
Sakuya!

518
00:24:08,708 --> 00:24:10,625
I'm left with no choice.

519
00:24:10,708 --> 00:24:11,875
Forgive me.

520
00:24:20,375 --> 00:24:21,750
Eri!

521
00:25:58,375 --> 00:25:59,583
Territory war...

522
00:25:59,666 --> 00:26:00,750
loneliness...

523
00:26:00,833 --> 00:26:01,958
dark clouds...

524
00:26:02,041 --> 00:26:03,166
underground...

525
00:26:03,250 --> 00:26:04,250
freeze...

526
00:26:04,333 --> 00:26:05,333
rampage...

527
00:26:05,416 --> 00:26:06,416
karma...

528
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:07,666
chaos...

529
00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:08,500
Donor...

530
00:26:08,583 --> 00:26:09,333
recipient...

531
00:26:09,416 --> 00:26:10,458
despair...

532
00:26:10,541 --> 00:26:11,500
rebirth...

533
00:26:11,583 --> 00:26:12,583
denouement...

534
00:26:12,666 --> 00:26:15,666
On the next episode of
.hack//Quantum.
