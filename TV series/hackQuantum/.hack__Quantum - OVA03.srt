1
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:29,750
You're what we might call
a "Partial Lost One."

2
00:00:29,833 --> 00:00:31,708
You're still being
displayed by the program,

3
00:00:31,791 --> 00:00:33,541
but part of your data is lost.

4
00:00:33,625 --> 00:00:35,833
It was most likely
taken to the other side,

5
00:00:35,916 --> 00:00:37,666
when you tried
to help your friend.

6
00:00:38,708 --> 00:00:41,583
That would also explain your
tingling hand in real life.

7
00:00:42,666 --> 00:00:44,958
Speaking of, I was told
there's been some change

8
00:00:45,041 --> 00:00:46,708
in your friend's condition.

9
00:00:46,791 --> 00:00:48,291
Yeah...

10
00:00:48,375 --> 00:00:52,375
On the night of the eleventh,
she responded just for a moment.

11
00:00:52,458 --> 00:00:56,583
Which means it really was her
who we ran into in Mac Anu.

12
00:00:56,666 --> 00:00:59,250
If our mysterious enemy
wants to do the most damage,

13
00:00:59,333 --> 00:01:01,958
he'll target this
upcoming Territory War...

14
00:01:02,041 --> 00:01:03,208
That's tens of thousands

15
00:01:03,291 --> 00:01:05,500
of people from multiple
servers participating.

16
00:01:05,583 --> 00:01:08,875
We can't shut down an event
that big on mere suspicion.

17
00:01:11,083 --> 00:01:14,416
And of course, for the
admins it's business as usual.

18
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:15,291
How come?

19
00:01:15,375 --> 00:01:16,875
It was such a major incident!

20
00:01:16,958 --> 00:01:20,208
The trouble was localized,
though--and it didn't last long.

21
00:01:20,291 --> 00:01:22,166
Do not log back in
until we've established

22
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:24,125
some countermeasures
against our foe.

23
00:01:24,208 --> 00:01:25,500
I mean it, Sakuya.

24
00:01:25,583 --> 00:01:26,666
Huh?!

25
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:28,708
You're what he's after--
if he catches you,

26
00:01:28,791 --> 00:01:30,833
we lose our trump card.

27
00:01:30,916 --> 00:01:33,416
I urge you to
exercise restraint.

28
00:01:41,416 --> 00:01:43,833
Whoever's at the root of all
this is looking for some kind

29
00:01:43,916 --> 00:01:46,541
of donor to help
a sick little boy.

30
00:01:46,625 --> 00:01:50,208
That boy died seven years ago,
at the age of ten...

31
00:01:50,291 --> 00:01:52,791
But our enemy's been scouring
The World turning players

32
00:01:52,875 --> 00:01:57,250
into Lost Ones, still looking
for someone compatible.

33
00:01:58,708 --> 00:01:59,875
What we can't figure out

34
00:01:59,958 --> 00:02:02,541
is why he needs a donor
for someone who's dead.

35
00:02:06,958 --> 00:02:08,833
I was giving it some thought...

36
00:02:08,916 --> 00:02:11,583
You think it's possible he
doesn't know that the boy died?

37
00:02:11,666 --> 00:02:12,208
What?!

38
00:02:12,291 --> 00:02:13,541
No!

39
00:02:13,625 --> 00:02:15,708
I figured he just went
crazy because he found out

40
00:02:15,791 --> 00:02:17,125
the boy had died!

41
00:02:17,208 --> 00:02:18,791
The kid's been dead seven years.

42
00:02:18,875 --> 00:02:21,166
There's no way he wouldn't know!

43
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:22,250
Let's call it a day.

44
00:02:22,333 --> 00:02:24,416
Get some food,
take a bath, and crash.

45
00:02:37,458 --> 00:02:39,208
Black balls...?

46
00:02:41,291 --> 00:02:43,875
Wow, girl, nice catch
finding this post.

47
00:02:43,958 --> 00:02:45,083
What do you think?

48
00:02:45,166 --> 00:02:47,250
Are these like what we saw?

49
00:02:49,958 --> 00:02:52,458
This is too vague
to know for sure...

50
00:02:59,250 --> 00:02:59,666
Great.

51
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:01,250
Here again.

52
00:03:01,333 --> 00:03:05,333
Dead seven whole years, and it
still hurts every single time.

53
00:03:24,875 --> 00:03:27,333
All this PK'ing sucks.

54
00:03:27,416 --> 00:03:29,125
Yeah, maybe we
should've joined in.

55
00:03:29,208 --> 00:03:31,583
We could've plowed through
a hundred people, easy.

56
00:03:31,666 --> 00:03:35,250
Yeah, killing a hundred people
in a fake world is so cool.

57
00:03:35,333 --> 00:03:36,250
Excuse me?

58
00:03:36,333 --> 00:03:37,750
You talkin' to me, kid?

59
00:03:37,833 --> 00:03:39,083
So what if I am...?

60
00:03:39,166 --> 00:03:40,916
Are you gonna PK me?

61
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:41,625
Hey!

62
00:03:41,708 --> 00:03:43,208
Don't be such a jerk!

63
00:03:43,291 --> 00:03:46,375
You think I won't PK you on this
airship, you're sorely mistaken.

64
00:03:47,833 --> 00:03:50,875
This from someone too
scared to join a fake war.

65
00:03:50,958 --> 00:03:54,166
I guess you won't learn
until you die for real!

66
00:03:55,458 --> 00:03:56,125
Me, die?

67
00:03:56,208 --> 00:03:57,875
What are you, stupid?

68
00:03:57,958 --> 00:03:59,833
I'll PK you right here and--

69
00:04:04,916 --> 00:04:06,625
What did you do to her?!

70
00:04:06,708 --> 00:04:08,416
You like to PK people?

71
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:09,625
Allow me to...

72
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:12,416
return the favor in
heart-stopping fashion.

73
00:04:27,583 --> 00:04:29,958
No trace of anything odd...

74
00:04:34,666 --> 00:04:35,833
The fog...?

75
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
It hurts...

76
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:45,833
Whoa, dude...

77
00:04:45,916 --> 00:04:47,916
Over-acting a bit, aren'tcha?

78
00:04:50,291 --> 00:04:51,291
What's happening?!

79
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:53,625
Oh god, it hurts!

80
00:04:53,708 --> 00:04:56,041
It hurts!

81
00:04:56,125 --> 00:04:56,916
What the hell...?

82
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,208
Hey!

83
00:05:01,041 --> 00:05:02,541
Taste my steel!

84
00:05:06,208 --> 00:05:07,291
Damn it!

85
00:05:15,958 --> 00:05:17,250
These are--!

86
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
C'mon, Iori, pick up...

87
00:05:33,125 --> 00:05:35,916
So it's begun.

88
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,791
This is on your head.

89
00:05:37,875 --> 00:05:41,208
Seems your client is
a real piece of work.

90
00:05:41,291 --> 00:05:43,583
Now, tell me who
ordered that list!

91
00:05:43,666 --> 00:05:44,875
Sorry, missy.

92
00:05:44,958 --> 00:05:46,875
I got me a code of hon--ow!

93
00:05:46,958 --> 00:05:47,958
Hey!

94
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,833
Dammit, that hurt!

95
00:05:51,916 --> 00:05:53,416
Do not misunderstand.

96
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:56,166
This is no longer
a game we are playing.

97
00:05:59,791 --> 00:06:02,041
There's something wrong,
why can't we log out?!

98
00:06:02,125 --> 00:06:02,958
Be a man.

99
00:06:03,041 --> 00:06:04,291
Quit your whining...!

100
00:06:04,375 --> 00:06:05,416
Incoming!

101
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:08,000
Tobias!

102
00:06:08,875 --> 00:06:09,500
Hey!

103
00:06:09,583 --> 00:06:10,500
I saw her!

104
00:06:10,583 --> 00:06:11,833
Eri is here!

105
00:06:11,916 --> 00:06:12,791
Dammit!

106
00:06:12,875 --> 00:06:13,833
Heads up!

107
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,333
Sakuya!

108
00:06:25,166 --> 00:06:25,958
I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

109
00:06:26,041 --> 00:06:27,583
Pretend that didn't happen!

110
00:06:30,833 --> 00:06:31,666
Let's run...!

111
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:33,000
Now's our chance!

112
00:06:34,333 --> 00:06:35,291
Come on!

113
00:06:42,833 --> 00:06:44,375
Why did you come back here?!

114
00:06:44,458 --> 00:06:47,291
Because, Iori, you wouldn't
answer the phone!

115
00:06:47,375 --> 00:06:48,666
What?!

116
00:06:51,583 --> 00:06:52,458
The One Sin!

117
00:06:52,541 --> 00:06:54,208
The bad guy's doing this, too?

118
00:06:54,291 --> 00:06:56,416
He sure isn't holding back.

119
00:07:11,833 --> 00:07:14,083
We'd better get going...

120
00:07:14,166 --> 00:07:16,750
Sakuya is waiting for us.

121
00:07:40,375 --> 00:07:41,541
What is that?!

122
00:07:41,625 --> 00:07:43,000
Huh?

123
00:08:25,958 --> 00:08:29,666
Clearly he's no longer concerned
about settling things quietly...

124
00:08:30,875 --> 00:08:35,083
And now, we can't even log out
until we destroy that thing.

125
00:08:35,166 --> 00:08:38,291
How ya gonna do that if we don't
even know where the hell it is?!

126
00:08:38,375 --> 00:08:40,750
We'll let him show us
where it is...

127
00:08:40,833 --> 00:08:42,125
Look...

128
00:08:42,208 --> 00:08:45,083
He's pulling out all the
biggest toys in the nursery.

129
00:08:45,166 --> 00:08:49,416
With that kind of power, why
bother stomping about like this?

130
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:52,875
If he insists on continuing
this childish behavior,

131
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:55,208
then when things
stop going his way,

132
00:08:55,291 --> 00:08:58,125
he's sure to show his hand.

133
00:08:58,208 --> 00:08:59,750
We'll just have to use...

134
00:08:59,833 --> 00:09:00,708
the Crest Gun.

135
00:09:00,791 --> 00:09:02,166
Huh?!

136
00:09:08,708 --> 00:09:09,958
Please hurry...!

137
00:09:10,041 --> 00:09:11,250
Let us in!

138
00:09:11,333 --> 00:09:12,958
Let us in!

139
00:09:13,708 --> 00:09:14,708
Guild master's quarters!

140
00:09:14,791 --> 00:09:15,833
Right!

141
00:09:20,708 --> 00:09:23,416
I can't fully analyze
the converted mnemonics.

142
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:26,083
Try reconverting using
different disassemblers.

143
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:28,875
The Crest Gun's disabled
for players, isn't it?

144
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:31,583
I'm stealing control back
from the SysAdmins.

145
00:09:31,666 --> 00:09:33,125
I said no!

146
00:09:33,208 --> 00:09:33,750
But...

147
00:09:33,833 --> 00:09:34,500
we really need...

148
00:09:34,583 --> 00:09:35,708
to see her!

149
00:09:39,416 --> 00:09:40,375
Idiot!

150
00:09:40,458 --> 00:09:41,833
Why did you come back?!

151
00:09:41,916 --> 00:09:43,458
Because of Eri--

152
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:46,166
What part of restraint
do you not understa--?!

153
00:09:49,375 --> 00:09:51,333
Oh, I get it now...

154
00:09:52,791 --> 00:09:54,666
It all makes sense.

155
00:10:00,208 --> 00:10:02,250
Given the ability
you just displayed,

156
00:10:02,333 --> 00:10:04,833
it's safe to assume your
right hand has access rights

157
00:10:04,916 --> 00:10:06,458
to the Pariah Folder...

158
00:10:06,541 --> 00:10:08,416
Place your hand on the wall...

159
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:09,250
But hey...!

160
00:10:09,333 --> 00:10:11,166
Don't erase anything!

161
00:10:15,625 --> 00:10:19,708
I'm rewriting the data through
Sakuya's FMD and address.

162
00:10:30,291 --> 00:10:31,583
Secret door...?

163
00:10:31,666 --> 00:10:34,333
I've taken the data we need
from the Pariah Folder.

164
00:10:41,333 --> 00:10:42,416
Bummer.

165
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:44,583
Everybody stopped
the war game already?

166
00:10:45,916 --> 00:10:47,000
Lame...

167
00:10:47,083 --> 00:10:48,958
Who thought the end
would be so boring?

168
00:10:50,958 --> 00:10:53,708
Wish I coulda played
with Sakuya again though...

169
00:11:03,875 --> 00:11:04,500
Why...

170
00:11:04,583 --> 00:11:05,750
us?!

171
00:11:12,625 --> 00:11:14,458
Why can't we warp outta here?!

172
00:11:14,541 --> 00:11:16,500
The Chaos Gate's down!

173
00:11:16,583 --> 00:11:18,083
Reopen the gate!

174
00:11:18,166 --> 00:11:21,541
We'll move all survivors
over to the Crest Gun!

175
00:11:21,625 --> 00:11:22,791
Wait, what?!

176
00:11:22,875 --> 00:11:24,916
Y'mean you were the ones
who locked the gate?!

177
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,458
The average player would never
obey a complete stranger...

178
00:11:28,541 --> 00:11:31,083
And I needed an army here...

179
00:11:31,166 --> 00:11:32,666
Start guiding them through!

180
00:11:33,583 --> 00:11:35,916
Everyone get to
the Chaos Gate...!

181
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,666
We can fix all this...!

182
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:39,666
But we need your help!

183
00:11:43,208 --> 00:11:44,916
It's time for us to leave too.

184
00:11:46,041 --> 00:11:47,125
Let's go.

185
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,208
Iori!

186
00:11:50,291 --> 00:11:52,375
It's a message from Hermit!

187
00:11:52,458 --> 00:11:53,791
He says Eri's in Megin Fi!

188
00:11:53,875 --> 00:11:54,458
Huh?!

189
00:11:54,541 --> 00:11:55,875
I gotta go!

190
00:11:55,958 --> 00:11:56,916
Stop her!

191
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,125
Do not let Sakuya go alone!

192
00:11:59,208 --> 00:11:59,916
Whoa there...!

193
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,208
I'm sorry!

194
00:12:05,166 --> 00:12:06,583
Why are you doing this...?!

195
00:12:06,666 --> 00:12:08,166
I have to rescue Eri!

196
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:09,500
Shut up...!

197
00:12:09,583 --> 00:12:12,416
I'm going to send Tobias
to the Inverted City...

198
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:15,125
Listen: even if you
find Eri in Megin Fi,

199
00:12:15,208 --> 00:12:17,125
you can't do anything for her.

200
00:12:18,375 --> 00:12:20,500
So I need you to
draw out our foe.

201
00:12:20,583 --> 00:12:22,500
You're going to be
attacking Mag Mell's heart.

202
00:12:22,583 --> 00:12:23,666
I'm fairly certain finding

203
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:26,666
a donor is no longer
this person's goal.

204
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:29,166
If we try interfering
with his plans directly,

205
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:31,291
he's sure to have fail-safes.

206
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:32,791
Now.

207
00:12:32,875 --> 00:12:35,125
We'll need to stay in touch,
so, I'll open Whisper Mode.

208
00:12:35,208 --> 00:12:35,916
We don't have much time.

209
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,166
Let's go!

210
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:39,166
Iori...

211
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:41,125
Please, take me with you!

212
00:12:41,208 --> 00:12:43,666
No, I'm going to
Megin Fi alone...

213
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:44,708
But don't worry.

214
00:12:44,791 --> 00:12:47,875
I promise you I will find Eri.

215
00:12:47,958 --> 00:12:49,125
Iori!

216
00:12:51,208 --> 00:12:52,208
Was that wise?

217
00:12:52,291 --> 00:12:53,750
Our goals may be different,

218
00:12:53,833 --> 00:12:57,250
but we're all looking for the
same ending to this debacle.

219
00:12:57,333 --> 00:12:59,833
So I'll use every
pawn on the board.

220
00:13:18,583 --> 00:13:19,750
When you come out of

221
00:13:19,833 --> 00:13:22,000
the Chaos Gate, start
working your way down...

222
00:13:22,083 --> 00:13:24,125
Follow the blood vessels
and you'll find the heart.

223
00:13:24,208 --> 00:13:25,541
Got it.

224
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:30,458
Split everyone into six teams
and be ready to move out...!

225
00:13:30,541 --> 00:13:32,166
Fire up the power reactor...!

226
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:34,750
I want this gun
loaded yesterday!

227
00:13:45,041 --> 00:13:46,208
Move quickly, please!

228
00:13:46,291 --> 00:13:48,166
No idle hands!

229
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:56,083
C'mon, hurry!

230
00:13:56,166 --> 00:13:58,125
You are so not helping!

231
00:13:58,208 --> 00:14:00,333
It's really damp
all of a sudden.

232
00:14:00,416 --> 00:14:01,708
That means you're close.

233
00:14:01,791 --> 00:14:02,791
Stay on your toes.

234
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:03,916
I will.

235
00:14:12,666 --> 00:14:13,916
Okay...

236
00:14:20,708 --> 00:14:21,375
Iori...?!

237
00:14:21,458 --> 00:14:22,458
Damn it!

238
00:14:22,541 --> 00:14:23,958
What's goin' on,
did somethin' happen...?

239
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:25,208
Wha--?

240
00:14:25,291 --> 00:14:26,333
Hey!

241
00:14:28,916 --> 00:14:30,250
Not yet.

242
00:14:31,458 --> 00:14:33,125
No destroying it yet...

243
00:14:33,208 --> 00:14:34,791
Sakuya's on her way.

244
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:36,833
So this was all your doing?

245
00:14:39,791 --> 00:14:41,583
We've lost Whisper Mode...

246
00:14:41,666 --> 00:14:43,750
Sakuya really was his goal!

247
00:14:49,208 --> 00:14:50,208
Area keywords.

248
00:14:50,291 --> 00:14:51,625
Uh...

249
00:14:58,791 --> 00:15:01,583
Does Sakuya know the
truth about me, too?

250
00:15:03,083 --> 00:15:04,541
Sakuya?!

251
00:15:04,625 --> 00:15:06,958
She never once thought you were
anything but her friend...!

252
00:15:07,041 --> 00:15:09,750
Now please, stop all this
and give Eri back!

253
00:15:12,041 --> 00:15:13,125
Thank you.

254
00:15:13,208 --> 00:15:15,166
That's what I wanted to hear.

255
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:15,916
Wait!

256
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:16,708
Hermit...!

257
00:15:16,791 --> 00:15:18,333
What're you gonna do?!

258
00:16:06,875 --> 00:16:08,166
Eri...!

259
00:16:08,833 --> 00:16:09,666
What the--?!

260
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:10,583
Guess who?

261
00:16:10,666 --> 00:16:12,416
Hermit, hi!

262
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,583
Eri is with the
bad guy below...

263
00:16:14,666 --> 00:16:17,125
I can lead you there
if you want me to...

264
00:16:17,208 --> 00:16:18,916
Brave Sakuya's gonna defeat

265
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,750
the evil villain trying
to destroy The World.

266
00:16:21,833 --> 00:16:23,375
He's not a villain.

267
00:16:24,625 --> 00:16:26,875
I found out that he's been
searching for a long time

268
00:16:26,958 --> 00:16:29,666
for a genetic donor to
save a sick little boy...

269
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:32,916
So I know he can't
be a bad person.

270
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,083
You know, that boy
died a long time ago.

271
00:16:36,166 --> 00:16:37,708
Turns out...

272
00:16:37,791 --> 00:16:39,666
that I'm compatible.

273
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:40,458
So I...

274
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:42,291
I have to go tell him...!

275
00:16:43,708 --> 00:16:45,000
Really...?

276
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:05,000
Asumi...!

277
00:17:05,083 --> 00:17:06,166
Dammit...

278
00:17:08,541 --> 00:17:09,916
That was awesome!

279
00:17:12,083 --> 00:17:12,875
Eri?!

280
00:17:12,958 --> 00:17:13,583
Asumi!

281
00:17:13,666 --> 00:17:14,875
Get away from Hermit!

282
00:17:14,958 --> 00:17:16,666
He's the one who did this!

283
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:20,666
Nice work...

284
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:22,333
You found the final boss.

285
00:17:23,541 --> 00:17:25,083
Wait, what?

286
00:17:25,166 --> 00:17:26,666
You heard her...

287
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:29,083
I'm behind all of this...

288
00:17:29,166 --> 00:17:32,708
Now if you defeat me,
you'll have cleared this quest.

289
00:17:54,541 --> 00:17:55,958
What're you saying, Hermit...?

290
00:17:56,041 --> 00:17:57,708
"Defeat you," why?

291
00:17:57,791 --> 00:18:00,916
I'm the one who's been turning
people into Lost Ones.

292
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,250
And I'm the dead
little boy, too...

293
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:05,541
Although, it was only recently

294
00:18:05,625 --> 00:18:08,625
that I found out
about the dead part.

295
00:18:08,708 --> 00:18:12,125
But see, I don't
remember how I got here...

296
00:18:12,208 --> 00:18:13,291
I just woke up

297
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:16,166
as this character,
holding this black twig.

298
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:17,750
It lets me do pretty much...

299
00:18:17,833 --> 00:18:20,750
whatever I imagine
in this world...

300
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:22,000
Kinda like...

301
00:18:22,083 --> 00:18:24,416
a wizard or somethin'...

302
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:27,791
I thought it must've been God
who gave it to me as a blessing.

303
00:18:27,875 --> 00:18:30,916
But I can't use it
to cure myself.

304
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,708
I told myself not to think about

305
00:18:32,791 --> 00:18:35,250
what happened to the
people I poked with it...

306
00:18:35,333 --> 00:18:37,458
Mostly because I was scared to,

307
00:18:37,541 --> 00:18:40,125
but also because I didn't
see any other way.

308
00:18:41,416 --> 00:18:42,750
Correct elevation...!

309
00:18:42,833 --> 00:18:46,250
Target: The digital
bastille on Mag Mell!

310
00:18:57,291 --> 00:18:58,083
Sakuya...

311
00:18:58,166 --> 00:19:00,041
Erase me and end all this.

312
00:19:00,125 --> 00:19:01,458
Dammit no!

313
00:19:01,541 --> 00:19:04,291
There has got to be some other
way to fix this, Hermit!

314
00:19:05,791 --> 00:19:08,416
I know it's a game
to everyone else,

315
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:11,666
but this place has
been my reality...

316
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:13,375
It hurts when I get cut...

317
00:19:13,458 --> 00:19:15,541
and when I die.

318
00:19:15,625 --> 00:19:17,333
But it never stops.

319
00:19:17,416 --> 00:19:20,208
To keep on living when
I've got no future...

320
00:19:20,291 --> 00:19:22,708
it's like I'm
trapped in a nightmare!

321
00:19:24,208 --> 00:19:25,708
Let me end it.

322
00:19:26,541 --> 00:19:27,416
On my mark...

323
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:28,875
and fire!

324
00:19:43,666 --> 00:19:45,416
You made me happy...

325
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:47,708
You were the only one, Sakuya...

326
00:19:47,791 --> 00:19:50,333
who ever called me "friend."

327
00:19:50,416 --> 00:19:51,208
Can I...

328
00:19:51,291 --> 00:19:53,625
ask one last, selfish favor?

329
00:19:56,458 --> 00:19:57,750
D'you think...

330
00:19:57,833 --> 00:19:59,833
you could gimme a hug?

331
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:12,791
Now I know why I was
drawn to you, Sakuya...

332
00:20:12,875 --> 00:20:13,833
'Cause I've...

333
00:20:13,916 --> 00:20:16,125
been looking for you forever!

334
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:19,000
M'sorry...

335
00:20:37,958 --> 00:20:40,458
The incident during the
Christmas Territory War Event

336
00:20:40,541 --> 00:20:42,833
was forgotten in
just a few weeks.

337
00:20:42,916 --> 00:20:47,000
And The World went back to being
its same old lively self...

338
00:20:47,083 --> 00:20:49,333
But as for Eri, Iori and me...

339
00:20:50,625 --> 00:20:51,791
We couldn't quite
bring ourselves

340
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:53,583
to go back there for a while...

341
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:57,666
Not until the guild master
sent me that message.

342
00:20:58,958 --> 00:20:59,958
Um, uh...

343
00:21:00,041 --> 00:21:00,958
Hello?

344
00:21:01,041 --> 00:21:01,916
Oh, Asumi!

345
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,291
Good, you're there!

346
00:21:03,375 --> 00:21:05,708
I don't have much time--I'll
try to make this short.

347
00:21:05,791 --> 00:21:06,750
It's about Hermit...

348
00:21:06,833 --> 00:21:07,750
he's alive.

349
00:21:07,833 --> 00:21:08,916
What?!

350
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,958
His father's connections
got the boy's body

351
00:21:11,041 --> 00:21:13,208
preserved in cryonic
suspension...

352
00:21:13,291 --> 00:21:16,208
which required him being
declared legally dead first.

353
00:21:16,291 --> 00:21:18,541
That's how they connected him
to the digital bastille.

354
00:21:18,625 --> 00:21:19,833
"Digital bastille"?

355
00:21:19,916 --> 00:21:21,750
A system for
life-sentence criminals,

356
00:21:21,833 --> 00:21:24,208
reducing them to mere
brains for imprisonment.

357
00:21:24,291 --> 00:21:27,416
It uses a technology called
"soul digitization."

358
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:29,000
Yeah, um...

359
00:21:29,083 --> 00:21:32,208
The digitized brains are used
as parts of a quantum computer,

360
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:33,583
while the brains
themselves are stored

361
00:21:33,666 --> 00:21:36,000
in a cryopreservation
facility...

362
00:21:36,083 --> 00:21:37,791
Seems the lab
preserving Hermit's player

363
00:21:37,875 --> 00:21:39,541
supplied that technology.

364
00:21:39,625 --> 00:21:40,041
Really?

365
00:21:40,125 --> 00:21:40,791
So...

366
00:21:40,875 --> 00:21:42,250
So rest easy.

367
00:21:42,333 --> 00:21:44,375
Hermit does still have a body...

368
00:21:44,458 --> 00:21:45,958
And he's no criminal.

369
00:21:46,041 --> 00:21:48,416
There must be some puppet
master behind the scenes who

370
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:51,708
took advantage of him and made
him use the digital bastille...

371
00:21:51,791 --> 00:21:54,166
I'm sure it's no coincidence
that you and Hermit met.

372
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:56,041
A "puppet master"...

373
00:21:56,125 --> 00:21:56,958
not a god?

374
00:21:57,041 --> 00:21:58,625
Call it what you like...

375
00:21:58,708 --> 00:22:01,000
Come on, behave.

376
00:22:04,708 --> 00:22:07,625
I can tell you the rest
in Aomori, okay...?

377
00:22:07,708 --> 00:22:08,833
See ya then.

378
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:11,583
Ooh, Iori!

379
00:22:11,666 --> 00:22:13,166
I haven't been to
your baths in forever!

380
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:14,458
Me first!

381
00:22:15,333 --> 00:22:16,666
What are you, a child?

382
00:22:18,458 --> 00:22:22,583
Yeah, so, I'm joining the donor
registry when I turn eighteen...

383
00:22:22,666 --> 00:22:23,541
Then maybe...

384
00:22:23,625 --> 00:22:26,208
I can see Hermit
after he's well.

385
00:22:26,291 --> 00:22:27,291
Oh, yeah!

386
00:22:27,375 --> 00:22:29,583
I think Hermit's
waiting for you, too...

387
00:22:29,666 --> 00:22:32,041
It's obvious how much
he really liked you.

388
00:22:32,125 --> 00:22:33,500
Jeez, Eri...

389
00:22:33,583 --> 00:22:35,458
You talk about 'im like he's
your brother or somethin'!

390
00:22:36,625 --> 00:22:39,666
Yeah, well--hey, I was
with him the longest.

391
00:22:41,291 --> 00:22:43,875
And then all four of us
can play The World together!

392
00:22:43,958 --> 00:22:45,416
What, after all we went through

393
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:47,250
you're not the
least bit worried?

394
00:22:47,333 --> 00:22:50,750
Until soul digitization tech is
gone from The World completely,

395
00:22:50,833 --> 00:22:52,375
it'll keep being used...

396
00:22:52,458 --> 00:22:54,708
It'll just take on
a different form...

397
00:22:54,791 --> 00:22:56,416
Which is why people like us

398
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:59,375
will always need to be
around to keep tabs on it.

399
00:23:00,416 --> 00:23:03,291
That game is the world
my brother loved...

400
00:23:03,375 --> 00:23:05,416
They won't have
their way with it.

401
00:23:10,958 --> 00:23:13,125
Ew, don't throw
that in the bath.

402
00:23:13,208 --> 00:23:14,500
I won't...

403
00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:17,250
Night, Hermit...

404
00:23:17,333 --> 00:23:19,291
I'll see you soon, right?
