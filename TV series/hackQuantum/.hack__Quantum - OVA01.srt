1
00:00:13,083 --> 00:00:13,833
Well, how 'bout it...?

2
00:00:13,916 --> 00:00:15,375
Are you guys free later?

3
00:00:15,958 --> 00:00:16,666
Hmm...?

4
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:17,541
You mean tonight?

5
00:00:17,625 --> 00:00:18,375
Mm-hmm!

6
00:00:18,458 --> 00:00:19,875
Not real sure yet...

7
00:00:19,958 --> 00:00:21,375
Depends on how
theater club goes.

8
00:00:21,458 --> 00:00:22,416
Ah, ay, ee...

9
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,458
Shouldn't be
a problem, though...

10
00:00:24,541 --> 00:00:26,291
There is this area I've
been wanting to check out,

11
00:00:26,375 --> 00:00:28,416
if you think you
guys're up for it.

12
00:00:30,083 --> 00:00:30,958
Fine by me.

13
00:00:31,041 --> 00:00:32,708
You in, Eri?

14
00:00:32,791 --> 00:00:33,750
I don't know.

15
00:00:33,833 --> 00:00:35,333
I've got a lot
of studying to do...

16
00:00:35,416 --> 00:00:38,333
I think I could maybe
meet up after ten.

17
00:00:38,416 --> 00:00:40,291
That's what I like to hear...!

18
00:00:40,375 --> 00:00:42,000
You can only do
so much studying...

19
00:00:42,083 --> 00:00:43,750
A girl's gotta live a little!

20
00:00:47,666 --> 00:00:48,541
Tonight it is, then!

21
00:00:48,625 --> 00:00:50,541
We'll meet in Mac Anu at ten.

22
00:00:50,625 --> 00:00:53,083
Show up late and you shall
be left for the enemy!

23
00:00:53,166 --> 00:00:54,666
Excuse me?

24
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:57,083
Thought I was the dramatic one.

25
00:01:27,625 --> 00:01:28,625
Dammit...

26
00:01:34,458 --> 00:01:35,541
Hello?!

27
00:01:35,625 --> 00:01:37,708
I could use a little
help here, you guys!

28
00:01:44,458 --> 00:01:45,916
Nice move!

29
00:02:01,958 --> 00:02:03,833
Well, this is getting old quick.

30
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:05,791
More of 'em?

31
00:02:10,541 --> 00:02:11,916
Smoke Screen!

32
00:02:14,875 --> 00:02:15,625
Hold on!

33
00:02:15,708 --> 00:02:17,541
Wait for me!

34
00:02:20,208 --> 00:02:23,166
That's our Tobias,
always good in a pinch!

35
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:25,416
We're lucky to
have you for a friend!

36
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:28,166
Flattery will get
you nowhere, Sakuya.

37
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:30,291
Look at you,
suddenly all bashful...!

38
00:02:30,375 --> 00:02:31,833
You were great, too, Mary.

39
00:02:31,916 --> 00:02:33,041
Thanks!

40
00:02:33,125 --> 00:02:34,541
Jeez...

41
00:02:34,625 --> 00:02:36,750
You got lost on a straight
path...? How'd you manage that?

42
00:02:36,833 --> 00:02:38,833
It's not like
you're some newbie.

43
00:02:38,916 --> 00:02:40,000
Yes!

44
00:02:40,083 --> 00:02:41,458
But even a monkey
may fall from a tree.

45
00:02:41,541 --> 00:02:44,500
Even Shakespeare himself
may mangle a verse!

46
00:02:44,583 --> 00:02:45,500
Yeah...

47
00:02:45,583 --> 00:02:46,875
You're no Shakespeare.

48
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:48,291
Give her a break...

49
00:02:48,375 --> 00:02:51,208
You know the old saying,
"Even death won't cure a fool."

50
00:02:51,291 --> 00:02:53,458
Our dear Miss Sakuya
here definitely falls

51
00:02:53,541 --> 00:02:54,833
in that category.

52
00:02:54,916 --> 00:02:56,291
Real nice...!

53
00:02:56,375 --> 00:02:59,291
Don't wound me physically,
just hurt my pride instead!

54
00:03:00,541 --> 00:03:02,375
"Pride," she says...

55
00:03:02,458 --> 00:03:03,583
Yeah, that's right...!

56
00:03:03,666 --> 00:03:06,083
Now knock it off or
I'll hurt you for real!

57
00:03:25,791 --> 00:03:26,958
Wow!

58
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:28,458
I didn't know you could
get through this way!

59
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:29,708
Yeah...

60
00:03:29,791 --> 00:03:32,375
The place has a bit of
history to it, in fact.

61
00:03:32,458 --> 00:03:33,083
Oh.

62
00:03:33,166 --> 00:03:34,041
What kind of history?

63
00:03:34,125 --> 00:03:35,583
Something special?

64
00:03:35,666 --> 00:03:38,833
It's an occult spot, but nothing
ventured, nothing gained...

65
00:03:38,916 --> 00:03:40,250
And it's at least worth trying.

66
00:03:40,333 --> 00:03:41,250
If we take this secret route,

67
00:03:41,333 --> 00:03:43,416
the treasure chest
prize changes.

68
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:46,166
Even better, this way we get
to avoid the boss fight!

69
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:47,708
We're not going to fight...?

70
00:03:47,791 --> 00:03:50,625
Wouldn't it be better to get
the experience poi--Hey, wait!

71
00:03:50,708 --> 00:03:51,166
Sweet!

72
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:52,500
I found an item!

73
00:03:53,625 --> 00:03:54,791
Sakuya!

74
00:03:54,875 --> 00:03:56,166
Uh, yeah?

75
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:58,166
You're always stopping
to pick up some lame item.

76
00:03:59,166 --> 00:04:00,041
No wonder you got los-

77
00:04:00,125 --> 00:04:01,875
Everyone take your positions!

78
00:04:03,541 --> 00:04:04,625
What're they doing?

79
00:04:04,708 --> 00:04:06,166
Impressive--looks
like one of the guilds

80
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:07,916
is gonna fight this boss.

81
00:04:18,125 --> 00:04:20,291
That dragon's huge!

82
00:04:20,375 --> 00:04:22,500
The One Sin.

83
00:04:22,583 --> 00:04:24,500
The World's
unbeatable monster...

84
00:04:24,583 --> 00:04:26,625
This thing's the
stuff of legend...

85
00:04:26,708 --> 00:04:29,666
In terms of raw power,
it has no rival...

86
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:32,750
The first players in history to
defeat it were given a name...

87
00:04:32,833 --> 00:04:34,791
Descendants of Fianna.

88
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:36,458
Let's see how they do.

89
00:04:39,166 --> 00:04:40,375
She's um...

90
00:04:40,458 --> 00:04:41,958
Nerding out?

91
00:04:50,416 --> 00:04:52,000
It has Reflect...

92
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:55,083
We'll target the elemental hits,
just like we planned...

93
00:04:55,166 --> 00:04:57,875
Healing team, stand back
at a safe distance.

94
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:01,708
They're actually going to
attack the dragon head-on.

95
00:05:01,791 --> 00:05:03,666
This is so hardcore...!

96
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:05,541
I need a screenshot!

97
00:05:05,625 --> 00:05:07,375
Don't get lost this time!

98
00:05:12,708 --> 00:05:14,000
It's going to breathe fire!

99
00:05:14,083 --> 00:05:15,666
Everybody spread out!

100
00:05:22,583 --> 00:05:25,250
Healing team, move in the
second it runs out of breath!

101
00:05:26,208 --> 00:05:28,791
Whoa, its breath
is lasting crazy long!

102
00:05:38,291 --> 00:05:39,666
What's that?

103
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,083
I kind of stepped
on something...

104
00:05:43,166 --> 00:05:44,791
What do I do now?!

105
00:05:44,875 --> 00:05:45,875
Please!

106
00:05:45,958 --> 00:05:47,500
Can't you stand still
for two seconds?

107
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:51,000
I think it stopped.

108
00:05:51,083 --> 00:05:52,041
Any static?

109
00:05:52,125 --> 00:05:53,208
None detected.

110
00:05:54,125 --> 00:05:55,708
Was that just an event?

111
00:06:04,416 --> 00:06:05,833
No way.

112
00:06:24,583 --> 00:06:25,375
So what now?

113
00:06:25,458 --> 00:06:26,333
It'll breathe fire again.

114
00:06:26,416 --> 00:06:27,666
Get outside!

115
00:06:32,416 --> 00:06:35,916
This boss fight has a
surprise instant-kill trap...

116
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:36,875
They've got us.

117
00:06:36,958 --> 00:06:38,375
Look over there!

118
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:44,000
That's Tobias the
information broker.

119
00:07:00,666 --> 00:07:02,708
I doubt it'll chase us
all the way here.

120
00:07:06,875 --> 00:07:08,416
Seriously?!

121
00:07:14,875 --> 00:07:16,458
Thanks, CC Corp...

122
00:07:16,541 --> 00:07:17,875
Let's go!

123
00:07:28,083 --> 00:07:29,291
Mary, what--?!

124
00:07:29,375 --> 00:07:31,750
We're done for if it
breathes fire at us here!

125
00:07:32,875 --> 00:07:34,083
She's got spunk.

126
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,166
Come back!

127
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:48,291
You idiot!

128
00:07:48,375 --> 00:07:49,541
I was leading the
thing away from you!

129
00:07:49,625 --> 00:07:51,041
What're you doing?!

130
00:07:51,125 --> 00:07:54,625
If Tobi and I just run away,
how are you going to escape?

131
00:07:57,333 --> 00:07:58,208
Get over here!

132
00:07:58,291 --> 00:07:59,458
Let's run.

133
00:08:03,291 --> 00:08:04,625
Hurry!

134
00:08:18,666 --> 00:08:20,958
Man, I thought we
were dead for sure!

135
00:08:21,041 --> 00:08:23,208
And whose fault
do you think that was?

136
00:08:24,125 --> 00:08:26,750
I mean, we didn't
even get the rare item...

137
00:08:26,833 --> 00:08:28,958
We went through all that
trouble for nothing.

138
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:31,083
No, that's not true.

139
00:08:31,166 --> 00:08:32,125
It was a game...

140
00:08:32,208 --> 00:08:33,458
but regardless,

141
00:08:33,541 --> 00:08:36,041
everything we did tonight
was a real experience...

142
00:08:36,125 --> 00:08:38,916
As far as I'm concerned, the
memories we make in The World

143
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
are worth far more than
any treasure could be.

144
00:08:42,083 --> 00:08:43,458
Tobias...

145
00:08:44,458 --> 00:08:47,333
Hey, when'd you pick up that
rare mantle you're wearing?

146
00:08:47,416 --> 00:08:48,083
Huh...?

147
00:08:48,166 --> 00:08:49,583
Hey, yeah, that's new!

148
00:08:49,666 --> 00:08:52,375
Well, memories are great,
but treasure's still awesome.

149
00:08:52,458 --> 00:08:55,333
And here I was, all moved
by your little speech.

150
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:09,416
Y'gotta admit though,
tonight really was a blast.

151
00:09:11,208 --> 00:09:12,125
Oh, yeah...

152
00:09:12,208 --> 00:09:13,375
Awesome!

153
00:09:13,458 --> 00:09:15,250
I love The World!

154
00:09:23,875 --> 00:09:25,041
Asumi...?

155
00:09:25,791 --> 00:09:26,875
Asumi!

156
00:09:27,541 --> 00:09:28,958
Wake up already!

157
00:09:30,541 --> 00:09:31,416
Yeah, I'm up.

158
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:32,791
I promise.

159
00:09:32,875 --> 00:09:34,541
Eri's already here.

160
00:09:36,041 --> 00:09:37,458
No way!

161
00:09:37,541 --> 00:09:38,500
I'm so late!

162
00:09:38,583 --> 00:09:40,500
Why didn't you
wake me up earlier?

163
00:09:49,291 --> 00:09:51,083
Since you're going out
after school anyway,

164
00:09:51,166 --> 00:09:53,000
pick up some tissues
for us, will you?

165
00:09:53,083 --> 00:09:54,208
Huh?

166
00:09:54,291 --> 00:09:56,208
How did you know
I was going out?

167
00:09:56,291 --> 00:09:57,583
Hey!

168
00:09:57,666 --> 00:09:59,416
I thought I told you not to
look through my stuff!

169
00:10:00,541 --> 00:10:01,750
'Kay, later, Mom!

170
00:10:01,833 --> 00:10:02,791
Sorry, Eri.

171
00:10:02,875 --> 00:10:03,958
Let's book it!

172
00:10:04,583 --> 00:10:05,500
Jeez...

173
00:10:05,583 --> 00:10:07,583
why do you
oversleep every morning?

174
00:10:08,666 --> 00:10:10,708
What I want to know
is why you don't.

175
00:10:10,791 --> 00:10:12,291
You stay up as late as I do!

176
00:10:12,375 --> 00:10:13,458
It's called an alarm?

177
00:10:13,541 --> 00:10:14,708
Mine doesn't work before noon.

178
00:10:14,791 --> 00:10:16,333
Uh-huh.

179
00:10:21,416 --> 00:10:22,708
Hey, wait for us!

180
00:10:22,791 --> 00:10:24,625
No, please come back...!

181
00:10:24,708 --> 00:10:26,000
Stop the bus!

182
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:27,541
Please, we need to get on!

183
00:10:29,416 --> 00:10:32,625
Look, Eri, I did it...!
Come on, hurry up!

184
00:10:45,583 --> 00:10:46,833
We made it.

185
00:10:46,916 --> 00:10:48,958
What, did you guys
run all the way here...?

186
00:10:49,041 --> 00:10:50,708
You might try
waking up earlier.

187
00:10:50,791 --> 00:10:51,875
Thanks...

188
00:10:51,958 --> 00:10:52,875
What are you wearing?

189
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:54,250
You look like a freak.

190
00:10:54,333 --> 00:10:55,791
Yeah, so what if I do...?

191
00:10:55,875 --> 00:10:58,541
This may surprise you, but I
dress for utility and comfort.

192
00:10:58,625 --> 00:11:01,250
Well, here in the
real world, anyway.

193
00:11:01,333 --> 00:11:02,708
Blech...

194
00:11:02,791 --> 00:11:04,250
It doesn't make sense to me.

195
00:11:04,333 --> 00:11:05,458
When we're in-game,

196
00:11:05,541 --> 00:11:07,750
your appearance is your
highest priority...

197
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:09,166
but then at school,

198
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:11,875
you don't even care if
you're dressed like a loser?!

199
00:11:11,958 --> 00:11:13,625
I didn't ask for your opinion.

200
00:11:14,375 --> 00:11:16,875
All right, today we'll be
talking about "implants."

201
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:19,083
As you know, this term
refers to the microchips

202
00:11:19,166 --> 00:11:20,958
you all have inside of you...

203
00:11:21,041 --> 00:11:22,333
We'll begin by examining why

204
00:11:22,416 --> 00:11:25,458
this technology became
necessary, and the reason...

205
00:11:25,541 --> 00:11:28,916
The price of materials has
been plummeting for days now.

206
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,125
There's info coming in
on a complete-item drop

207
00:11:31,208 --> 00:11:33,541
in the new mission next month...

208
00:11:33,625 --> 00:11:36,166
Guess I'd better sell
before demand dries up.

209
00:11:54,208 --> 00:11:56,833
A 300,000 GP bounty?

210
00:11:56,916 --> 00:11:59,000
It says here you're "charged
with malicious interference

211
00:11:59,083 --> 00:12:01,916
and the consequent interruption
of a mission, as well as...

212
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,958
the deaths of sixteen guild
members." Sounds pretty serious.

213
00:12:05,041 --> 00:12:06,708
"Contact Yata-no-Kagami guild...

214
00:12:06,791 --> 00:12:08,291
Will pay for any info."

215
00:12:08,375 --> 00:12:11,583
I'm officially finished.

216
00:12:11,666 --> 00:12:12,916
Well, congrats...!

217
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,666
What will you do with your
newly-found celebrity?

218
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:17,458
You might take
this more seriously.

219
00:12:17,541 --> 00:12:20,208
I'm not the only one
they're after, you know...

220
00:12:20,291 --> 00:12:21,916
This is an absolute disaster.

221
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,291
How am I supposed to
live in The World now?

222
00:12:24,375 --> 00:12:26,458
You know Asumi, this might
be a good opportunity

223
00:12:26,541 --> 00:12:28,791
to take a little time
off from gaming.

224
00:12:28,875 --> 00:12:30,916
With finals coming up and all.

225
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,125
Jeez, Eri, you sound like my mom
when you say stuff like that.

226
00:12:34,208 --> 00:12:37,333
I'm just gonna pull an all-night
cramming session, so I'm good.

227
00:12:37,416 --> 00:12:39,333
Oh, cool, then I'll do that too!

228
00:12:39,416 --> 00:12:41,666
One night of studying
doesn't sound so bad.

229
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:43,291
You need to take
this seriously...!

230
00:12:43,375 --> 00:12:44,458
Iori can get away with it

231
00:12:44,541 --> 00:12:46,750
because she's got
better grades than you.

232
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:49,708
We're only a year away
from college entrance exams.

233
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:51,583
You're really not gonna
let this go, are you?

234
00:12:51,666 --> 00:12:53,375
All I know is I'm not
playing The World

235
00:12:53,458 --> 00:12:55,333
until finals are behind me...

236
00:12:55,416 --> 00:12:56,666
We need to start
thinking about where

237
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:59,416
we're all going
to be a year from now.

238
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:00,916
That's easy.

239
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,166
In a year we'll all still
be playing The World together.

240
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:05,083
You're impossible!

241
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,541
I know what you meant...

242
00:13:07,625 --> 00:13:09,458
The thing is, a year ago
I thought I'd just be

243
00:13:09,541 --> 00:13:11,375
a high-schooler
like everyone else.

244
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:13,666
Study, take tests, and graduate.

245
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:15,375
But since I started
playing The World,

246
00:13:15,458 --> 00:13:17,208
my life is about more
than just coming here

247
00:13:17,291 --> 00:13:18,708
and then going home again...

248
00:13:18,791 --> 00:13:19,875
It's like I suddenly realized

249
00:13:19,958 --> 00:13:22,458
I can have a whole life
outside of school.

250
00:13:23,375 --> 00:13:26,541
Sure, bad things happen,
like this stuff with the guild.

251
00:13:26,625 --> 00:13:28,250
But that's only once in a while.

252
00:13:28,333 --> 00:13:29,750
Mostly it's fun.

253
00:13:30,708 --> 00:13:32,916
What I like most
is the companionship...

254
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,166
I met you because of
The World, Iori...

255
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:36,833
and Eri, I love that you and I

256
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:39,958
can play together
like when we were kids.

257
00:13:40,041 --> 00:13:42,833
But I seem to be causing
lots of problems lately.

258
00:13:42,916 --> 00:13:45,541
At the rate I'm going,
you guys'll get sick of me.

259
00:13:45,625 --> 00:13:47,583
So I decided the most
important thing to me

260
00:13:47,666 --> 00:13:49,416
was going to the
same college as Eri,

261
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,375
and I came up with a way
to make that happen.

262
00:13:51,458 --> 00:13:51,750
Really?!

263
00:13:51,833 --> 00:13:52,375
You did?

264
00:13:52,458 --> 00:13:54,000
Yep.

265
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:55,583
And the solution is so simple

266
00:13:55,666 --> 00:13:57,916
I can't believe I didn't
think of it before...

267
00:13:58,750 --> 00:13:59,833
All right!

268
00:13:59,916 --> 00:14:01,041
I expect to see the two of you

269
00:14:01,125 --> 00:14:03,958
at our usual spot
at eight o'clock sharp.

270
00:14:04,041 --> 00:14:06,083
What about this big plan
you came up with?

271
00:14:06,166 --> 00:14:08,083
You'll see when you get there!

272
00:14:09,125 --> 00:14:12,375
Somehow I doubt she's actually
put much thought into this.

273
00:14:13,875 --> 00:14:17,083
Her solution's probably to do
all our studying in The World...

274
00:14:17,166 --> 00:14:18,375
Eh?

275
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:36,458
Attention players:

276
00:14:36,541 --> 00:14:40,000
This field is about to be shut
down for server maintenance--

277
00:14:51,041 --> 00:14:52,208
Stop there!

278
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:53,916
You got the wrong person!

279
00:15:01,708 --> 00:15:04,083
All because of
this stupid bounty.

280
00:15:06,083 --> 00:15:07,583
I can't believe Mary and Tobias

281
00:15:07,666 --> 00:15:09,833
aren't coming into
The World today.

282
00:15:09,916 --> 00:15:11,000
This is boring.

283
00:15:11,083 --> 00:15:13,000
I told them I wanted us
to study in-game.

284
00:15:13,083 --> 00:15:14,666
We had a plan.

285
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:19,583
Maybe the guild would
forgive me if I apologized.

286
00:15:20,666 --> 00:15:21,458
Whoa!

287
00:15:21,541 --> 00:15:22,458
I got something...!

288
00:15:22,541 --> 00:15:23,416
And it's heavy...!

289
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:25,125
This is gonna be a big one!

290
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:35,458
Find her?

291
00:15:35,541 --> 00:15:36,833
Huh-uh.

292
00:15:36,916 --> 00:15:38,458
Maybe she warped already.

293
00:15:38,541 --> 00:15:39,708
I got someone watching the gate.

294
00:15:39,791 --> 00:15:41,541
There must be somewhere
we haven't searched yet.

295
00:15:41,625 --> 00:15:42,500
Move it.

296
00:15:43,333 --> 00:15:44,791
Okay.

297
00:15:45,708 --> 00:15:47,958
Wow, you really got yourself.

298
00:15:48,041 --> 00:15:49,458
Seems like stuff in The World's

299
00:15:49,541 --> 00:15:52,708
been a lot more realistic
than it has to be lately, huh?

300
00:15:52,791 --> 00:15:55,750
Someone's taking
their job too seriously.

301
00:15:55,833 --> 00:15:57,833
There, all done.

302
00:15:57,916 --> 00:15:59,708
Yeah, thank you.

303
00:15:59,791 --> 00:16:01,583
Yeah, o'course, no problem...

304
00:16:01,666 --> 00:16:02,833
My name's Asu--uh...

305
00:16:02,916 --> 00:16:03,833
Sakuya...

306
00:16:03,916 --> 00:16:05,375
Nice to meet you!

307
00:16:05,458 --> 00:16:06,083
You too.

308
00:16:06,166 --> 00:16:07,250
I'm Hermit.

309
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:08,458
Hermit, huh...?

310
00:16:08,541 --> 00:16:10,958
Like the tarot card?

311
00:16:11,041 --> 00:16:12,375
Sort of...

312
00:16:12,458 --> 00:16:15,083
So, I saw there's a big
bounty out on your head, huh?

313
00:16:15,166 --> 00:16:16,166
Yeah!

314
00:16:17,916 --> 00:16:20,083
Wait, you're not
with the guild, are you?!

315
00:16:20,166 --> 00:16:21,666
No, don't worry.

316
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:25,208
But I was there and
saw all of that happen...

317
00:16:25,291 --> 00:16:26,583
I wondered though,

318
00:16:26,666 --> 00:16:29,000
did you happen to pick up
anything strange there?

319
00:16:29,833 --> 00:16:30,916
Lemme think here...

320
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:33,958
Well...

321
00:16:34,041 --> 00:16:36,208
I pick up pretty much anything
I see, so it's hard to say...

322
00:16:36,291 --> 00:16:38,041
Was it a rare item or something?

323
00:16:39,083 --> 00:16:40,208
No, never mind.

324
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:41,750
Forget it...

325
00:16:41,833 --> 00:16:43,041
One other thing, though.

326
00:16:44,541 --> 00:16:46,750
Those two who were
with you yesterday...

327
00:16:46,833 --> 00:16:48,875
Are they coming back today?

328
00:16:48,958 --> 00:16:50,750
Oh, you mean Tobias and Mary...

329
00:16:50,833 --> 00:16:54,125
Not today, but I'll totally
introduce you to 'em sometime...

330
00:16:54,208 --> 00:16:56,625
They're the friends I do
all my gaming with.

331
00:16:58,083 --> 00:16:59,000
Your friends?

332
00:16:59,083 --> 00:17:00,291
There she is!

333
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:05,708
Someone posted this
in the guild's name

334
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:07,458
and I want to know who!

335
00:17:07,541 --> 00:17:09,750
I did not authorize this...

336
00:17:09,833 --> 00:17:12,125
It's just shameless harassment!

337
00:17:12,208 --> 00:17:15,041
I'm sorry, Ma'am, it was one of
the non-members who joined us.

338
00:17:15,125 --> 00:17:17,791
I want this post pulled before
it causes us any trouble.

339
00:17:17,875 --> 00:17:20,083
Do I make myself understood?

340
00:17:20,166 --> 00:17:21,041
Uh...

341
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:23,208
What now?!

342
00:17:23,291 --> 00:17:24,541
I, uh...

343
00:17:24,625 --> 00:17:26,833
I'm terribly sorry to have
to inform you of this...

344
00:17:26,916 --> 00:17:28,000
But his...

345
00:17:28,083 --> 00:17:30,083
sympathizers have
already taken action.

346
00:17:31,416 --> 00:17:32,875
Ow, that...

347
00:17:32,958 --> 00:17:33,708
doesn't hurt.

348
00:17:33,791 --> 00:17:35,625
Don't struggle...

349
00:17:35,708 --> 00:17:37,041
Those restraints
are cheat items.

350
00:17:37,125 --> 00:17:39,000
You ain't never
gettin' free of 'em.

351
00:17:39,083 --> 00:17:41,375
And don't even think about
logging out with them on.

352
00:17:41,458 --> 00:17:43,500
Try that crap and your
account will be forfeit.

353
00:17:43,583 --> 00:17:45,083
Here's the deal:
you want me to let you go,

354
00:17:45,166 --> 00:17:46,541
you better call the others
who were with you--

355
00:17:46,625 --> 00:17:47,875
No way...!

356
00:17:47,958 --> 00:17:50,541
I told you, I was the one
who activated the trap.

357
00:17:50,625 --> 00:17:51,875
And I only made friends

358
00:17:51,958 --> 00:17:54,500
with Hermit here a minute
before you captured us.

359
00:17:54,583 --> 00:17:57,416
So there's no reason to drag
him into this, okay...?

360
00:17:59,416 --> 00:18:01,125
It's not as simple as that...

361
00:18:01,208 --> 00:18:02,458
Do you have any clue

362
00:18:02,541 --> 00:18:04,375
how much time I spent
preparing for that quest?

363
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:05,958
How much work it took?

364
00:18:06,041 --> 00:18:08,625
After all that, did you really
think I was gonna let you off

365
00:18:08,708 --> 00:18:11,083
with nothin' but an apology?

366
00:18:11,166 --> 00:18:11,791
Well...

367
00:18:11,875 --> 00:18:13,083
yeah, I kinda did.

368
00:18:19,791 --> 00:18:20,916
Not nice.

369
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,916
You're actin' like
we're the bad guys.

370
00:18:23,666 --> 00:18:25,916
You're the one who started
all this, you know.

371
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:26,708
Come on...

372
00:18:26,791 --> 00:18:28,083
one way or another,

373
00:18:28,166 --> 00:18:30,583
you are gonna end up calling
those friends of yours.

374
00:18:30,666 --> 00:18:32,250
We'll start with
this little guy.

375
00:18:32,333 --> 00:18:33,666
Since you just met him,

376
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:36,083
I'm sure he's not as important
to you as the other two.

377
00:18:36,166 --> 00:18:36,958
Whaddya think?

378
00:18:37,041 --> 00:18:38,541
Filthy coward!

379
00:18:42,333 --> 00:18:43,875
Leave my friends outta this!

380
00:18:45,166 --> 00:18:46,416
Damn, she's taking
the offensive!

381
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:47,625
Sakuya!

382
00:18:49,333 --> 00:18:50,625
Iyoten!

383
00:18:56,708 --> 00:18:58,291
Hey, hold up a sec.

384
00:18:58,375 --> 00:19:00,666
I can't tell one player
from another in this!

385
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:05,083
Iyoten, are you okay?

386
00:19:05,166 --> 00:19:06,583
Find the girl, damn it.

387
00:19:06,666 --> 00:19:07,541
Get off...!

388
00:19:07,625 --> 00:19:08,083
Wait...

389
00:19:08,166 --> 00:19:08,916
what was that?

390
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
My technique.

391
00:19:10,083 --> 00:19:10,541
Ha!

392
00:19:10,625 --> 00:19:11,791
They're here!

393
00:19:13,916 --> 00:19:15,541
Don't worry,
Sakuya, I've gotcha!

394
00:19:15,625 --> 00:19:16,541
No!

395
00:19:18,333 --> 00:19:20,250
Everything under
control here, guys?

396
00:19:20,333 --> 00:19:21,666
What, you're here too?!

397
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:23,125
What're you doing?

398
00:19:23,208 --> 00:19:25,666
You guys told me earlier you
weren't gonna play today.

399
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:28,625
We had to swoop in to save
the damsel in distress.

400
00:19:28,708 --> 00:19:31,291
We happened upon
an interesting post...

401
00:19:31,375 --> 00:19:32,791
Imagine our surprise when

402
00:19:32,875 --> 00:19:36,083
it said a wanted girl was
being chased through town.

403
00:19:36,166 --> 00:19:38,875
Honestly, now's not the time
to go all doey-eyed.

404
00:19:39,583 --> 00:19:40,291
Iyoten?

405
00:19:41,916 --> 00:19:44,416
He was the free agent who joined
the battle against The One Sin.

406
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:45,083
Yes.

407
00:19:45,166 --> 00:19:46,625
I looked into him,

408
00:19:46,708 --> 00:19:49,125
and apparently he's got a record
of pulling stunts like this.

409
00:19:49,208 --> 00:19:50,208
It was simple, really.

410
00:19:50,291 --> 00:19:51,541
I just extracted the address

411
00:19:51,625 --> 00:19:54,166
and reported it before we
came here to rescue you.

412
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:55,666
Wow, that was good thinking!

413
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:57,166
Piece o'cake.

414
00:19:57,250 --> 00:19:59,458
I'm very sorry, Hermit.

415
00:19:59,541 --> 00:20:02,000
You shouldnt've had to get
mixed up in our problems.

416
00:20:02,083 --> 00:20:02,500
Oh...

417
00:20:02,583 --> 00:20:04,000
it's fine.

418
00:20:04,083 --> 00:20:05,083
Hey Hermit!

419
00:20:05,166 --> 00:20:07,250
Thanks a lot for
saving me back there...

420
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:09,416
Catch.

421
00:20:10,583 --> 00:20:12,458
It's just a little
thank-you present...

422
00:20:12,541 --> 00:20:13,708
I know it's not much,

423
00:20:13,791 --> 00:20:16,083
but it's the best I can
do at the moment, so...

424
00:20:30,708 --> 00:20:31,166
Look!

425
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:31,833
Over there!

426
00:20:31,916 --> 00:20:32,958
I see 'em!

427
00:20:33,041 --> 00:20:34,875
Ugh, they found us already!

428
00:20:34,958 --> 00:20:36,875
They're not gonna
give up easy, are they?

429
00:20:42,958 --> 00:20:44,083
Those fools...

430
00:20:44,166 --> 00:20:44,708
Move!

431
00:20:44,791 --> 00:20:45,833
Right!

432
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:51,166
Ow!

433
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,375
Whoa, sorry!

434
00:20:56,416 --> 00:20:58,000
Good, there's a Smoke Screen.

435
00:21:10,041 --> 00:21:11,583
Quick, go around!

436
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:14,250
Dangit, these guys are stubborn.

437
00:21:16,291 --> 00:21:17,333
You there!

438
00:21:17,416 --> 00:21:18,750
I need to speak with you...!

439
00:21:18,833 --> 00:21:20,458
Get down here this instant!

440
00:21:20,541 --> 00:21:21,583
That's not good.

441
00:21:21,666 --> 00:21:23,041
Just ignore her!

442
00:21:23,125 --> 00:21:24,541
I think that little
girl's the boss.

443
00:21:24,625 --> 00:21:25,625
Forget about her!

444
00:21:26,541 --> 00:21:27,833
You ain't gettin' away!

445
00:21:37,333 --> 00:21:38,666
Damn!

446
00:21:42,833 --> 00:21:43,958
I surrender!

447
00:21:45,958 --> 00:21:46,833
Asta!

448
00:21:46,916 --> 00:21:47,541
Oh, yeah.

449
00:21:47,625 --> 00:21:48,708
I'm way ahead of you.

450
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:55,708
Sakuya!

451
00:21:57,583 --> 00:21:58,708
She needs help!

452
00:22:09,708 --> 00:22:10,833
Hermit!

453
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:17,166
I think I'm gonna PK
you first, cat boy.

454
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:18,000
Please, no!

455
00:22:18,083 --> 00:22:19,125
Stop right there!

456
00:22:22,375 --> 00:22:23,958
Hermit, no!

457
00:22:29,458 --> 00:22:30,208
What the--?!

458
00:22:39,083 --> 00:22:39,916
What is this...?

459
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Where are we?

460
00:22:41,083 --> 00:22:43,291
It's certainly not
an official field.

461
00:22:43,375 --> 00:22:45,125
Hey, you're that boss girl!

462
00:22:46,208 --> 00:22:47,791
Where did all the others go?

463
00:22:56,833 --> 00:22:57,833
Wait, are those...

464
00:22:57,916 --> 00:22:59,000
people?

465
00:23:03,416 --> 00:23:04,250
What?!

466
00:23:04,333 --> 00:23:05,500
Sophia...?

467
00:23:05,583 --> 00:23:06,583
Sakuya!

468
00:23:06,666 --> 00:23:07,500
Hurry...!

469
00:23:07,583 --> 00:23:09,166
We need to log out now...

470
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:10,500
This place is bad!

471
00:23:10,583 --> 00:23:11,416
Mary...!

472
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:12,500
Tobias...!

473
00:23:12,583 --> 00:23:14,000
But where'd Hermit go?

474
00:23:14,083 --> 00:23:15,083
Don't know...

475
00:23:15,166 --> 00:23:17,166
If he was PK'd
he'll return to town...

476
00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:18,125
but for now--

477
00:23:19,833 --> 00:23:21,291
Mary, just leave him!

478
00:23:24,125 --> 00:23:25,333
Smith, no!

479
00:23:30,625 --> 00:23:32,125
What happened?

480
00:23:32,208 --> 00:23:33,958
I was caught unprepared...

481
00:23:34,041 --> 00:23:35,791
This entire area...

482
00:23:35,875 --> 00:23:37,458
It's a Pariah Folder.

483
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:39,000
Wait, what are you saying?

484
00:23:44,875 --> 00:23:45,958
Come on.

485
00:23:47,083 --> 00:23:48,416
Son of a...

486
00:23:53,625 --> 00:23:55,041
What the heck was that?

487
00:23:55,125 --> 00:23:56,083
I wish I knew...

488
00:23:56,166 --> 00:23:57,416
but it can wait for now.

489
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:59,291
Let's just get offline quick.

490
00:23:59,375 --> 00:24:00,500
'Kay.

491
00:24:00,583 --> 00:24:02,000
I'll send an email later.

492
00:24:03,291 --> 00:24:04,125
Behind you!

493
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Take that!

494
00:24:08,083 --> 00:24:09,250
Mary!

495
00:24:15,708 --> 00:24:16,500
What's happening?!

496
00:24:16,583 --> 00:24:17,708
Eri!

497
00:26:05,166 --> 00:26:05,916
Comas...

498
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,083
Lost Ones...
