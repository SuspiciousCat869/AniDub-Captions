1
00:01:21,661 --> 00:01:24,426
Mirai! Yuuki!

2
00:01:25,272 --> 00:01:26,182
Shall we go?

3
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:27,309
Uh!

4
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:42,191
Yuuki!

5
00:01:43,463 --> 00:01:45,599
Yuuki! Yuuki!

6
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:49,604
What's wrong?! Answer me! Yuuki!

7
00:01:50,133 --> 00:01:50,973
Yuuki!

8
00:01:52,726 --> 00:01:53,567
What happened?!

9
00:01:53,862 --> 00:01:55,425
He just suddenly...

10
00:01:56,047 --> 00:01:59,207
Yuuki! Yuuki, C'mon! Wake up!

11
00:02:01,188 --> 00:02:02,258
Don't move him!

12
00:02:05,392 --> 00:02:06,809
We'd better keep him still.

13
00:02:24,571 --> 00:02:26,340
We have to get him to a hospital.

14
00:02:27,078 --> 00:02:29,144
I'll get someone to help. Stay here.

15
00:02:31,196 --> 00:02:32,013
Mari!

16
00:02:32,474 --> 00:02:33,418
Stay with him!

17
00:02:34,666 --> 00:02:36,238
You're his big sister, right?

18
00:02:37,786 --> 00:02:38,914
I'll be back soon.

19
00:02:52,238 --> 00:02:53,027
Yuuki...

20
00:02:55,306 --> 00:02:58,774
I've got an emergency case here! Clear the way!

21
00:02:59,261 --> 00:03:01,196
Any patients with a green triage,

22
00:03:01,683 --> 00:03:03,578
you should be able to walk on your own,

23
00:03:03,603 --> 00:03:05,267
so please move to this tent over here!

24
00:03:06,124 --> 00:03:06,807
Strong.

25
00:03:07,389 --> 00:03:07,914
Pupils?

26
00:03:07,914 --> 00:03:09,479
When is someone going to help us?!

27
00:03:09,503 --> 00:03:11,318
We've been waiting for so long!

28
00:03:11,377 --> 00:03:13,940
We're going in order. Please be patient.

29
00:03:54,324 --> 00:03:55,058
Huh?

30
00:03:56,429 --> 00:03:57,531
Yuuki?

31
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:10,523
It's not true...

32
00:05:11,497 --> 00:05:13,940
It's not true. It's not true...

33
00:05:15,991 --> 00:05:16,650
Mirai?

34
00:05:18,044 --> 00:05:18,837
Mirai.

35
00:05:22,843 --> 00:05:24,578
Mirai, are you okay?

36
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:26,167
Mari...

37
00:05:31,083 --> 00:05:33,660
Does your brother have any drug allergies?

38
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:36,617
No, madam.

39
00:05:37,564 --> 00:05:41,048
Has he ever been hospitalized
with a major illness or injury?

40
00:05:41,073 --> 00:05:42,057
No, madam.

41
00:05:42,082 --> 00:05:43,303
Thank you very much.

42
00:06:04,151 --> 00:06:05,997
How long are we supposed to wait?!

43
00:06:06,116 --> 00:06:06,547
Help me!

44
00:06:06,572 --> 00:06:07,981
Over here, please!

45
00:06:19,362 --> 00:06:20,035
Yuuki...

46
00:06:21,037 --> 00:06:22,408
He won't die, right?

47
00:06:27,449 --> 00:06:29,185
I'm sure he'll be all right.

48
00:06:29,316 --> 00:06:31,713
You saw how he was running around before.

49
00:06:32,663 --> 00:06:33,197
Yeah.

50
00:06:33,892 --> 00:06:34,662
You're right.

51
00:06:36,436 --> 00:06:38,021
Yuuki can't die.

52
00:06:39,136 --> 00:06:39,593
Uh.

53
00:06:46,024 --> 00:06:47,827
Doctor, over here, please!

54
00:06:48,167 --> 00:06:48,755
Vitals?

55
00:06:48,986 --> 00:06:51,422
He has no pulse, and there's no respiration.

56
00:07:40,828 --> 00:07:41,731
Yuuki...

57
00:07:43,709 --> 00:07:44,894
Sis is here.

58
00:07:45,567 --> 00:07:46,497
I'm right here.

59
00:08:11,718 --> 00:08:13,266
I'm impressed, Mirai.

60
00:08:14,129 --> 00:08:15,703
You're not falling apart.

61
00:08:17,424 --> 00:08:18,491
Well... That's..

62
00:08:19,529 --> 00:08:21,102
Yuuki'll be OK.

63
00:08:22,666 --> 00:08:26,005
He's just a little tired. He just got sick.

64
00:08:28,896 --> 00:08:30,493
He has to be okay.

65
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:43,636
Yuuki... Don't give up.

66
00:08:45,514 --> 00:08:46,337
Sis!

67
00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:47,972
Sis!

68
00:08:49,589 --> 00:08:50,807
Sis!

69
00:08:55,777 --> 00:08:57,149
Sis is here.

70
00:08:58,318 --> 00:08:59,278
I'm here.

71
00:09:20,174 --> 00:09:20,953
Doctor.

72
00:09:32,226 --> 00:09:32,861
What?

73
00:09:40,962 --> 00:09:41,690
Why?

74
00:09:51,151 --> 00:09:52,519
Yuuki...

75
00:09:54,484 --> 00:09:55,473
Sis.

76
00:09:56,377 --> 00:09:57,411
Sis!

77
00:09:58,799 --> 00:09:59,825
Sis!

78
00:10:10,848 --> 00:10:11,674
Yuuki?

79
00:10:12,871 --> 00:10:14,780
Did I fall asleep or something?

80
00:10:59,532 --> 00:11:01,100
Darn it, Yuuki!

81
00:11:02,012 --> 00:11:03,213
What are you doing?!

82
00:11:03,412 --> 00:11:04,975
Oh! Hi, Sis!

83
00:11:08,228 --> 00:11:12,170
Honestly! You can't go running
around just because you feel better!

84
00:11:12,224 --> 00:11:16,171
It's okay! Really The doctor
said I was perfectly fine now.

85
00:11:16,196 --> 00:11:17,800
No, it's not "okay"!

86
00:11:18,443 --> 00:11:20,541
You still have to rest! You know.

87
00:11:21,757 --> 00:11:24,893
You're making such a big deal about them giving me an IV.

88
00:11:28,487 --> 00:11:31,600
Well, from now on, you stick to my side, okay?

89
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:33,227
'Kay!

90
00:11:34,757 --> 00:11:35,548
Honestly.

91
00:11:39,192 --> 00:11:43,162
It's all your fault I had that totally weird dream.

92
00:11:43,162 --> 00:11:43,997
A dream?

93
00:11:44,330 --> 00:11:48,373
Uh. They took you in for an emergency surgery.

94
00:11:49,325 --> 00:11:51,718
It didn't work, and you died.

95
00:11:52,913 --> 00:11:55,411
You have all sorts of weird dreams, Sis.

96
00:11:55,689 --> 00:11:59,160
I hear you go "Ahh!" in your
sleep in the middle of the night.

97
00:11:59,247 --> 00:12:00,171
Do I?

98
00:12:00,306 --> 00:12:04,755
Yeah! I heard you talk in your sleep a
bunch of times that all sorts of things.

99
00:12:04,817 --> 00:12:09,055
What? You sure you weren't just half-asleep yourself?

100
00:12:09,170 --> 00:12:11,827
I was not! I heard it, plain as day!

101
00:12:12,188 --> 00:12:14,823
I've had it! I've really had it!

102
00:12:19,788 --> 00:12:23,281
Right, right. Guess I'm a sleep-talker, too.

103
00:12:24,683 --> 00:12:26,826
You gonna giggle all day alone?

104
00:12:26,851 --> 00:12:29,242
Come on, it's time we got back to where Mari is.

105
00:12:29,487 --> 00:12:30,288
Uh!

106
00:12:32,945 --> 00:12:34,547
You don't hurt now?

107
00:12:34,665 --> 00:12:35,527
Uh-uh!

108
00:12:35,859 --> 00:12:36,560
Gotta puke?

109
00:12:36,814 --> 00:12:38,044
I'm fine.

110
00:12:38,117 --> 00:12:38,885
Really?

111
00:12:39,531 --> 00:12:40,810
Really really.

112
00:12:41,066 --> 00:12:44,233
So hey, let's get home as quick as we can.

113
00:12:44,757 --> 00:12:47,180
I bet Mari's really worried about Hina.

114
00:12:48,336 --> 00:12:50,557
You're right. Let's get home, fast.

115
00:12:50,836 --> 00:12:54,947
But, if you feel even a little sick again, you tell me

116
00:12:55,138 --> 00:12:57,292
I want to know immediately.

117
00:12:57,632 --> 00:12:58,754
You gotta that?

118
00:12:59,338 --> 00:13:00,877
Mm! Gotcha!

119
00:13:01,562 --> 00:13:04,112
I'm starting to think you're a little spoiled.

120
00:13:04,711 --> 00:13:06,828
Huh? You think so?

121
00:13:07,275 --> 00:13:08,312
Definitely.

122
00:13:18,524 --> 00:13:19,524
Hello dad,

123
00:13:19,849 --> 00:13:22,138
Junko, Kenai and I are all fine.

124
00:13:22,833 --> 00:13:25,633
If you get this massage, please just leave me a voice.

125
00:13:26,272 --> 00:13:29,155
Yes. My name is Mari Kusakabe...

126
00:13:29,394 --> 00:13:31,584
...with a possibility for land slides.

127
00:13:31,975 --> 00:13:37,940
Tsunamis are also feared, so citizens are advised
to stay away from the coast and all river front areas.

128
00:13:38,306 --> 00:13:43,525
Now at the fiery Sangenjaya we go
live to our live reporter Yuuki Ogasawara.

129
00:13:43,891 --> 00:13:46,346
Yuuki, tell us what's happening over there.

130
00:13:46,919 --> 00:13:48,928
Right! This is Yuuki Ogasawara.

131
00:13:49,142 --> 00:13:53,392
The fire which strike in Sangenjaya,
grew so large it threatened Setagaya ward,

132
00:13:53,815 --> 00:13:56,531
has finally been extinguished after burning for four days.

133
00:13:56,696 --> 00:14:00,425
However, the fire which centered in the
commercial district in front of the railway station,

134
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:03,334
spread to consume one section of the residential area.

135
00:14:03,588 --> 00:14:05,741
A large number of people have been left homeless.

136
00:14:05,805 --> 00:14:09,070
Greatest damage occurred to the shopping
arcade running along the commercial district.

137
00:14:09,203 --> 00:14:12,795
On the other hand, the residential
area didn't suffer nearly as much damage.

138
00:14:12,885 --> 00:14:17,507
And, thanks to evacuation orders being issued early
on, most residents were able to get to shelter areas...

139
00:14:17,532 --> 00:14:20,503
at the elementary school and the
park before the blaze became too bad.

140
00:14:20,866 --> 00:14:21,875
Kusakabe?

141
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:22,950
According to the fire department...

142
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:24,794
Ms. Mari Kusakabe?

143
00:14:24,819 --> 00:14:25,350
Yes?

144
00:14:25,828 --> 00:14:29,209
I've just finished filling out
all the necessary forms for you.

145
00:14:30,163 --> 00:14:31,496
Thank you very much.

146
00:14:31,759 --> 00:14:33,657
Here copies for you to keep.

147
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:48,325
Mirai!

148
00:14:58,191 --> 00:15:01,466
...and I accidentally ended up
washing my face with toothpaste!

149
00:15:01,688 --> 00:15:02,331
Mirai!

150
00:15:02,356 --> 00:15:03,149
Oh, Mari.

151
00:15:03,487 --> 00:15:05,555
Sorry I went for a walk on my own.

152
00:15:06,432 --> 00:15:10,481
I didn't see Yuuki when I woke up
this morning, so I went looking for him.

153
00:15:12,133 --> 00:15:15,819
I was worried for a while, but he seems okay now.

154
00:15:16,831 --> 00:15:19,946
Mari, we really need to hurry up and get you home to Hina.

155
00:15:20,604 --> 00:15:22,789
I'm sorry if I worried you.

156
00:15:43,996 --> 00:15:46,181
Hey sis, I'll carry that.

157
00:15:47,038 --> 00:15:51,821
It's okay. You were just sick. You need to take it easy.

158
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:54,411
Huh? But I'm fine.

159
00:15:56,082 --> 00:15:57,651
Quit being a tough guy.

160
00:15:58,367 --> 00:16:02,817
Anyway, this backpack's heavy. What have you got in it?

161
00:16:02,939 --> 00:16:05,963
All kinds of stuff! The book from the robot exhibit.

162
00:16:06,249 --> 00:16:09,679
The crackers and water. And present got for mom, too!

163
00:16:09,886 --> 00:16:11,372
And the bank with my money in it!

164
00:16:11,397 --> 00:16:15,147
Jeez... Yuuki, you need to keep your money in a wallet.

165
00:16:15,401 --> 00:16:18,108
It's heavy, carrying it around in this thing.

166
00:16:18,133 --> 00:16:20,231
It's not heavy. I'm a man!

167
00:16:20,798 --> 00:16:22,820
And I'm stronger than you, Sis!

168
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:24,868
No, you're not.

169
00:16:25,833 --> 00:16:29,548
Anyway, you've been lugging this thing all this time?

170
00:16:30,295 --> 00:16:32,123
You should have asked me for help.

171
00:16:54,853 --> 00:16:55,585
Mari?

172
00:16:56,744 --> 00:17:00,309
Did you hear something about Sangenjaya at the hospital?

173
00:17:02,008 --> 00:17:02,500
Uh.

174
00:17:03,516 --> 00:17:08,362
It seems the fire's been put out,
but it got pretty big before they did.

175
00:17:09,488 --> 00:17:12,596
But only one of the residential area burned.

176
00:17:12,923 --> 00:17:17,115
Most of the people evacuated to
the elementary school, so maybe...

177
00:17:18,998 --> 00:17:19,692
Mirai.

178
00:17:20,138 --> 00:17:20,874
Yes?

179
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:23,641
I left a voice mail for your parents.

180
00:17:26,305 --> 00:17:30,783
Oh. They had that there? I wonder if they'll get it.

181
00:17:32,244 --> 00:17:36,350
I'm sorry. As soon as we get to Sancha, I'll get you home.

182
00:17:36,699 --> 00:17:38,600
We can take care of Yuuki later.

183
00:17:38,691 --> 00:17:41,184
That's okay. I understand.

184
00:17:41,954 --> 00:17:46,646
He seems okay now right, but he
needs a real examination later.

185
00:17:47,493 --> 00:17:53,138
He hides it when he's sick, so
I'll have to keep a close eye on him.

186
00:17:53,799 --> 00:17:56,537
So, you don't have to worry about it, Mari.

187
00:17:56,912 --> 00:17:59,645
I can take care of my little brother just fine.

188
00:18:29,785 --> 00:18:32,849
I'm glad that they weren't hurt in the quake.

189
00:18:33,158 --> 00:18:34,985
Birds must have just flown away.

190
00:18:35,408 --> 00:18:36,422
Yeah, You're right.

191
00:18:42,887 --> 00:18:43,589
Yuuki.

192
00:18:45,055 --> 00:18:47,062
I'm sure Mom and Dad are fine.

193
00:18:48,531 --> 00:18:52,353
I mean, we are OK so I know they are OK, too.

194
00:18:53,077 --> 00:18:54,877
They're waiting for us to come home.

195
00:18:57,530 --> 00:18:58,097
Uh!

196
00:18:58,798 --> 00:19:02,315
If we could fly like birds,
then we could be home in a snap!

197
00:19:02,428 --> 00:19:03,428
Couldn't we.

198
00:19:05,538 --> 00:19:08,394
You're right. But we're almost home.

199
00:19:09,177 --> 00:19:13,523
So, let's keep walking. I
promise, I'm gonna bring you home.

200
00:19:17,996 --> 00:19:18,530
Uh.

201
00:19:36,377 --> 00:19:38,579
Does the way back look like it's okay?

202
00:19:38,727 --> 00:19:39,401
Uh-huh.

203
00:19:39,738 --> 00:19:43,834
Once we're through the park, we'll
take Ebisu Street to Yamate Avenue.

204
00:19:43,909 --> 00:19:44,414
Right.

205
00:19:49,261 --> 00:19:53,799
I'll bet Hina and your mom can't
wait for you to get home and hug them.

206
00:19:54,997 --> 00:19:59,598
And then you and I and Hina and
your mom will all have dinner tonight.

207
00:19:59,811 --> 00:20:01,249
Doesn't that sound like fine.

208
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:05,039
So, let's hurry up then get back home. OK.

209
00:20:09,061 --> 00:20:10,552
Thank you, Mirai...

210
00:20:12,547 --> 00:20:16,003
I'm sorry... I'm so sorry...!

211
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:22,462
Come on, Mari. Let's go! Everyone's waiting.

212
00:20:24,150 --> 00:20:26,149
Yeah, you're right.

213
00:20:28,053 --> 00:20:29,407
Hey, what's the matter.

214
00:20:29,909 --> 00:20:31,758
No, it's nothing.

215
00:20:32,424 --> 00:20:35,060
Want me to carry that bag? It's heavy, isn't it?

216
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:38,065
I'm fine! Yuuki could carry it.

217
00:20:38,344 --> 00:20:41,315
Besides, I want to, I'm his big sister!

218
00:22:21,457 --> 00:22:25,079
Fires in Sangenjaya, extinguished.
Daughter's safety, still unknown.
