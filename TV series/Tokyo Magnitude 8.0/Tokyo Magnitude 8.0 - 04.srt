1
00:01:27,414 --> 00:01:28,816
Zero-One, status report.

2
00:01:28,841 --> 00:01:32,004
We've rendezvoused with the fire
department. Initiating rescue operations.

3
00:01:39,493 --> 00:01:42,677
Relief supplies are being distributed in Shiba Park

4
00:01:42,763 --> 00:01:45,456
by the city of Tokyo and Minato ward.

5
00:01:45,779 --> 00:01:48,591
Please follow the directions to Shiba Park.

6
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:51,776
If you are injured, please remain here.

7
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:55,031
To repeat, relief supplies are
being distributed in Shiba Park...

8
00:01:55,056 --> 00:01:56,225
Have they arrived?

9
00:01:56,338 --> 00:01:59,432
No, next boat. It should be arriving in about 5 minutes.

10
00:01:59,457 --> 00:02:02,166
Shiba Park is about 15 minutes away...

11
00:02:02,449 --> 00:02:04,804
Mirai, are all your blisters all right?

12
00:02:06,224 --> 00:02:06,934
Yeah.

13
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:10,246
Okay then, shall we get going?

14
00:02:10,837 --> 00:02:11,405
Right.

15
00:02:13,184 --> 00:02:19,803
Yesterday, at approximately 3:46 PM, a major
earthquake occurred, centered on the Kanto region.

16
00:02:20,105 --> 00:02:24,595
The epicenter was in northern Tokyo
Bay, at a depth of 25 kilometers.

17
00:02:24,814 --> 00:02:28,575
The strength of the quake is estimated at magnitude 8.0.

18
00:02:32,167 --> 00:02:35,215
Ugh... Uh-oh.

19
00:02:36,514 --> 00:02:39,579
A PROMISE BY THE THREE

20
00:02:45,859 --> 00:02:50,218
Sis! I can see Tokyo Tower!
We're close to home now, right?

21
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,686
I said we're not.

22
00:02:51,975 --> 00:02:54,612
But we can see Tokyo Tower from home.

23
00:02:54,669 --> 00:02:57,001
Even so, home's still far away!

24
00:03:01,098 --> 00:03:02,888
Mirai, are you okay?

25
00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:05,147
I... I'm fine.

26
00:03:06,692 --> 00:03:11,532
Um... I'll be able to wash up at
the park when we get there, won't I?

27
00:03:11,616 --> 00:03:12,343
Hm...

28
00:03:12,408 --> 00:03:16,005
They'll have toilets, but I
don't know if the water's running.

29
00:03:19,263 --> 00:03:20,869
Did you get dirty somewhere?

30
00:03:20,957 --> 00:03:22,459
Um... No.

31
00:03:23,824 --> 00:03:27,914
Oh, yeah. Sis, when we get
home, I'll let you have my pudding.

32
00:03:28,615 --> 00:03:30,786
Why would you bring that up now?

33
00:03:30,812 --> 00:03:32,593
'Cuz you're trying so hard!

34
00:03:34,025 --> 00:03:37,644
Look, I'm not some little kid who needs snack time!

35
00:03:37,697 --> 00:03:40,600
Liar! You're like Sergeant Snack Time!

36
00:03:40,625 --> 00:03:42,115
"Sergeant Snack Time"?

37
00:03:42,210 --> 00:03:42,781
Yeah!

38
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:47,889
Ugh... I might be in trouble here...

39
00:03:49,009 --> 00:03:51,053
Mirai, do you have a stomachache?

40
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:53,045
I'm fine.

41
00:03:54,648 --> 00:03:57,199
Didn't I say to tell me when you're hurting?

42
00:04:01,211 --> 00:04:02,155
Hold on.

43
00:04:03,571 --> 00:04:04,765
gonna check things

44
00:04:24,017 --> 00:04:25,454
Are you hungry, sis?

45
00:04:26,473 --> 00:04:29,911
When we get home, let's go to grandpa's place in Hokkaido.

46
00:04:31,095 --> 00:04:33,251
We can get soft-serve or even...

47
00:04:33,276 --> 00:04:35,513
We're not going to Hokkaido this year!

48
00:04:37,143 --> 00:04:38,282
Dad told me...

49
00:04:41,265 --> 00:04:44,870
Hey! Sorry I took so long!

50
00:04:45,029 --> 00:04:46,341
Sorry, Mirai.

51
00:04:47,183 --> 00:04:49,414
Did that cake upset your stomach?

52
00:04:50,951 --> 00:04:52,819
Um, no. It didn't.

53
00:04:52,819 --> 00:04:53,397
Here.

54
00:04:54,071 --> 00:04:55,190
Portable toilet.

55
00:04:56,823 --> 00:04:59,639
What?! This is a toilet?! Let me see!

56
00:04:59,664 --> 00:05:03,001
Whoa, it's made out of paper!

57
00:05:04,528 --> 00:05:05,623
Check this out!

58
00:05:08,445 --> 00:05:11,296
Just say when you need it. You can use it anywhere.

59
00:05:11,829 --> 00:05:14,385
Um... I'm good for now.

60
00:05:15,193 --> 00:05:15,990
Oh?

61
00:05:17,344 --> 00:05:19,718
Portable toilets and wet wipes here!

62
00:05:19,937 --> 00:05:22,727
Portable toilets and wet wipes here!

63
00:05:24,696 --> 00:05:26,370
So many people...

64
00:05:26,708 --> 00:05:27,533
Yeah.

65
00:05:27,582 --> 00:05:29,664
Toilets... Where're the toilets?

66
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:32,793
Ah! We might be able to get food over there.

67
00:05:33,145 --> 00:05:37,615
Relief supplies are being
distributed! One per person, please!

68
00:05:38,052 --> 00:05:39,123
Ramen!

69
00:05:39,715 --> 00:05:41,717
Looks like they're giving it out over there.

70
00:05:42,239 --> 00:05:44,560
Sis, they've got instant ramen!

71
00:05:45,722 --> 00:05:47,044
Hey, Mirai...

72
00:06:04,007 --> 00:06:06,050
That was kind of a big one just now, huh?

73
00:06:06,575 --> 00:06:08,915
Let's go some place and catch our breath for now.

74
00:06:09,598 --> 00:06:11,550
What are those? Tents?

75
00:06:11,575 --> 00:06:13,347
No, they look like toilets.

76
00:06:15,903 --> 00:06:17,468
I'm going over there...

77
00:06:18,967 --> 00:06:21,651
We'll wait under these trees over here.

78
00:06:23,316 --> 00:06:26,469
For heaven's sake... She's stubborn. I'll give her that.

79
00:06:48,762 --> 00:06:50,741
Hey! This spot's open!

80
00:06:51,466 --> 00:06:53,278
Oh, we're saved!

81
00:06:54,007 --> 00:06:54,643
Lucky!

82
00:06:54,733 --> 00:06:56,503
Talk about your super-good timing!

83
00:06:56,528 --> 00:06:57,095
Right.

84
00:06:57,147 --> 00:06:57,773
Hey!

85
00:06:59,524 --> 00:07:01,125
No cutting! Wait your turn!

86
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:02,699
What? The spot was open.

87
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:05,743
You saw there was a line behind you! Don't lie to me!

88
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:09,421
Hey, he cut in front of you, too. Say something!

89
00:07:09,714 --> 00:07:10,262
Huh?!

90
00:07:10,776 --> 00:07:13,185
Hey! Don't hide behind that kid!

91
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,765
Aren't you ashamed to be doing that in front of children?

92
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:18,413
How old are you, anyway?!

93
00:07:18,469 --> 00:07:19,478
How the hell old are you, pal?!

94
00:07:19,503 --> 00:07:22,385
Don't play that game with me! We're about the same!

95
00:07:23,722 --> 00:07:26,447
Lemme go! You gonna follow the rules or not?!

96
00:07:26,646 --> 00:07:28,827
Shut up, you son of a bitch!

97
00:07:33,036 --> 00:07:34,294
Can't get through?

98
00:07:35,258 --> 00:07:37,995
I hope you can get through to Hina, soon, Mari.

99
00:07:38,104 --> 00:07:42,317
Yeah... By the way, you think
Sergeant Snack Time is all right?

100
00:07:46,044 --> 00:07:46,414
Huh?

101
00:07:47,527 --> 00:07:48,391
What's wrong?

102
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,520
M-Mari...

103
00:08:11,821 --> 00:08:15,259
Chocolate and M.R.E.s, here!

104
00:08:16,323 --> 00:08:17,992
They're all mixed together.

105
00:08:18,071 --> 00:08:19,928
I'll take some ramen!

106
00:08:20,139 --> 00:08:23,483
Sorry, but this tent is out of instant ramen!

107
00:08:28,489 --> 00:08:30,148
That guy had two.

108
00:08:30,703 --> 00:08:33,034
Yeah. Some grownups are like that.

109
00:08:33,488 --> 00:08:35,668
Even while they tell kids how to act.

110
00:08:35,912 --> 00:08:40,193
I'm sure he has a reason. Maybe
he's taking it to someone who's hurt.

111
00:08:40,263 --> 00:08:41,502
A reason. Right...

112
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:43,601
Ow!

113
00:08:45,156 --> 00:08:46,196
Mirai!

114
00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:48,714
Are you okay?! Did you get burned?

115
00:08:51,643 --> 00:08:55,144
The nerve! She didn't even apologize!

116
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:09,652
Here.

117
00:09:09,677 --> 00:09:10,565
Mirai dear.

118
00:09:12,645 --> 00:09:13,298
Here.

119
00:09:18,106 --> 00:09:18,893
Here you go.

120
00:09:22,736 --> 00:09:24,754
Sis, do you want me to hold it?

121
00:09:24,779 --> 00:09:27,862
No way! I said I was fine, didn't I?!

122
00:09:30,196 --> 00:09:32,190
I heard they brought in people from Shinagawa!

123
00:09:32,215 --> 00:09:32,881
Ow!

124
00:09:33,341 --> 00:09:33,697
Sorry!

125
00:09:33,722 --> 00:09:34,343
Pardon me!

126
00:09:35,387 --> 00:09:36,078
Sis!

127
00:09:36,103 --> 00:09:37,715
Mirai! You okay?

128
00:09:38,217 --> 00:09:39,635
What's the deal?!

129
00:09:45,529 --> 00:09:47,208
What's that?

130
00:09:47,718 --> 00:09:51,343
I think around here is where they're
bringing the people who have died.

131
00:10:18,903 --> 00:10:20,003
Um, excuse me.

132
00:10:20,028 --> 00:10:20,361
Yes?

133
00:10:20,524 --> 00:10:22,342
Any word on how Sancha is doing?

134
00:10:23,015 --> 00:10:25,685
Sancha, huh? Any word from Sancha?

135
00:10:25,826 --> 00:10:28,291
Sorry, we don't have any reports in from there yet.

136
00:10:33,801 --> 00:10:35,868
When will I get a call through?

137
00:10:40,785 --> 00:10:44,867
I wonder if the tree we planted is doing okay.

138
00:10:45,405 --> 00:10:46,761
Who cares about that?!

139
00:10:47,006 --> 00:10:47,968
Stupid

140
00:10:51,869 --> 00:10:54,899
I wonder if Dad and Mom are okay...

141
00:10:54,955 --> 00:10:57,080
I told you, I don't know!

142
00:10:57,319 --> 00:10:59,701
Even you should be able to understand that!

143
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,095
Mirai! Yuuki!

144
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:06,901
Looks like our route home is pretty much okay.

145
00:11:07,676 --> 00:11:08,543
Really?!

146
00:11:08,965 --> 00:11:09,926
Really!

147
00:11:12,107 --> 00:11:14,506
This is Shiba Park, where we are now.

148
00:11:14,635 --> 00:11:17,125
And, over here, is Shibuya.

149
00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:21,123
If we follow this straight,
we'll get to my home in Sangenjaya.

150
00:11:21,536 --> 00:11:27,017
After that, we follow Setagaya Street,
then cut over here to Kinuta Park.

151
00:11:27,247 --> 00:11:29,775
From there, it's just a short hop to your home.

152
00:11:30,195 --> 00:11:33,819
So, for now, why don't you come with me to Sangenjaya?

153
00:11:33,951 --> 00:11:36,425
And then it's a short hop to our house!

154
00:11:36,574 --> 00:11:37,965
Let's hit the road!

155
00:11:38,343 --> 00:11:39,132
Uh!

156
00:11:39,691 --> 00:11:42,293
And you'll give it your best too, right, Mirai?

157
00:11:45,773 --> 00:11:49,033
Maybe your phone will get
through when we get to the school.

158
00:11:50,549 --> 00:11:52,314
That makes no sense.

159
00:11:53,016 --> 00:11:57,445
I'm sure Yuuki just means he hopes
you'll get through. Isn't that right?

160
00:11:59,149 --> 00:12:01,778
Because you think then she'll be happy too, right?

161
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:07,718
Okay, then!

162
00:12:11,058 --> 00:12:15,108
All right, once I get back from
dumping our trash, we'll set out.

163
00:12:21,301 --> 00:12:24,236
It's like you and Mari are on the same wavelength.

164
00:12:29,565 --> 00:12:31,443
Is your stomach okay?

165
00:12:32,278 --> 00:12:33,522
I think so.

166
00:12:36,697 --> 00:12:40,401
Once we get back home, you can
have more than just my pudding.

167
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:43,930
Oh, for... Could you stop just talking about food, huh?

168
00:12:44,192 --> 00:12:46,339
Is your stomach still hurting, sis?

169
00:12:46,461 --> 00:12:47,562
Not really.

170
00:12:47,784 --> 00:12:50,462
Then what? We're almost home.

171
00:12:51,490 --> 00:12:54,641
I told you, we're NOT almost home! Besides...

172
00:12:55,119 --> 00:12:58,854
We don't even know if our house will
still be standing when we get there!

173
00:12:59,273 --> 00:13:03,389
Not to mention... I keep calling Mom
and Dad, but I can't even get through.

174
00:13:05,039 --> 00:13:07,280
Well, maybe the cell phone's still...

175
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:10,379
Or maybe they just don't care
whether we're all right or not!

176
00:13:15,005 --> 00:13:16,696
I really can't take it anymore...

177
00:13:31,816 --> 00:13:32,417
Here.

178
00:13:47,485 --> 00:13:50,790
Oh, God, I'm so sick of how you do that!

179
00:13:51,226 --> 00:13:53,935
If you have something to say, then say it!

180
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,786
Stop copying other people!

181
00:13:56,396 --> 00:14:01,138
First of all, if you hadn't wanted to see that
robot exhibit, we wouldn't even be in this mess!

182
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:03,410
This is all your fault!

183
00:14:08,933 --> 00:14:10,896
I wanted to see it...

184
00:14:11,807 --> 00:14:13,860
I wanted to see the bridge...

185
00:14:15,206 --> 00:14:19,698
Because they said they weren't going
to take us anywhere for summer vacation.

186
00:14:20,547 --> 00:14:24,061
So, I thought you and me could
go see the bridge together...!

187
00:14:25,237 --> 00:14:26,674
That wasn't all..

188
00:14:48,241 --> 00:14:49,858
How far did he go?

189
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:53,283
Oh, there you are!

190
00:14:53,482 --> 00:14:56,794
You two weren't where I left you,
so I've been looking everywhere!

191
00:14:57,333 --> 00:14:58,192
I'm sorry.

192
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,856
Did something happen? Where's Yuuki?

193
00:15:01,222 --> 00:15:03,763
I.. Hang on, I'll go look for him!

194
00:15:03,821 --> 00:15:05,542
Wait! Mirai?

195
00:15:05,811 --> 00:15:06,993
I'll be right back!

196
00:15:35,163 --> 00:15:36,751
That was a big one, huh?

197
00:15:37,402 --> 00:15:39,232
Did another building fall down?

198
00:15:39,264 --> 00:15:41,288
Stop that. You're scaring me.

199
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:50,848
Yuuki!

200
00:15:54,025 --> 00:15:55,359
Yuuki!

201
00:15:56,395 --> 00:15:57,587
Yuuki!

202
00:16:09,806 --> 00:16:10,499
Yuuki!

203
00:16:12,444 --> 00:16:15,211
Yuuki! Yuuki, come on!

204
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:19,790
Jeez... Mari's back. Come on. Let's go now.

205
00:16:20,692 --> 00:16:23,131
You don't understand, Sis.

206
00:16:25,146 --> 00:16:27,914
You can see our house from Tokyo Tower.

207
00:16:28,226 --> 00:16:31,851
I know! But we know the way to get home now.

208
00:16:32,212 --> 00:16:33,195
So let's go back.

209
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:36,364
We know the way back, but not if our house is okay!

210
00:16:36,468 --> 00:16:38,830
Even I can understand that much!

211
00:16:38,965 --> 00:16:42,039
And that's why I want to see how it is now!

212
00:16:43,130 --> 00:16:46,578
If you see it's okay, then you can calm down, right, Sis?

213
00:16:49,735 --> 00:16:51,607
I know I'll see our house.

214
00:16:51,906 --> 00:16:54,696
'Cuz we can see Tokyo Tower from home...

215
00:16:55,785 --> 00:16:57,404
So, I know I'll...

216
00:17:06,619 --> 00:17:09,468
Sis, Mom and Dad aren't dead..

217
00:17:12,817 --> 00:17:15,239
I miss Dad and Mom!

218
00:17:30,835 --> 00:17:32,935
Hi kids,what's the matter?

219
00:17:37,035 --> 00:17:38,378
What's the matter?

220
00:17:39,418 --> 00:17:41,858
Well, looks like they're lost.

221
00:17:42,896 --> 00:17:45,418
Miss, are you two by yourselves?

222
00:17:45,622 --> 00:17:48,111
Where's your father? Or your mother?

223
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:54,181
Oh, I'm sorry! I didn't mean to make you cry

224
00:17:54,206 --> 00:17:57,921
It's all right. We just haven't been able to get in touch.

225
00:18:02,473 --> 00:18:03,635
We'll see you.

226
00:18:07,446 --> 00:18:10,563
Let's get home soon and give Mom her present, okay?

227
00:18:31,979 --> 00:18:33,977
No way... Yuuki!

228
00:18:41,578 --> 00:18:42,684
Yuuki!

229
00:19:04,837 --> 00:19:05,774
Yuuki!

230
00:19:06,179 --> 00:19:06,925
Sis!

231
00:19:07,773 --> 00:19:08,428
Yuuki!

232
00:19:21,048 --> 00:19:21,869
Yuuki?

233
00:19:25,066 --> 00:19:26,286
You...ki?

234
00:19:28,430 --> 00:19:31,824
Hey! C'mon, don't kid around, OK?

235
00:19:32,253 --> 00:19:33,382
You can't be..

236
00:19:40,588 --> 00:19:41,135
No...

237
00:19:48,036 --> 00:19:49,548
I'm fine.

238
00:19:54,682 --> 00:19:55,466
Ow!

239
00:19:56,694 --> 00:19:59,495
Check the injured! Bring the car around

240
00:19:59,949 --> 00:20:01,924
Injured! Get the shamble apart

241
00:20:02,074 --> 00:20:03,840
Those who can move, help them

242
00:20:08,514 --> 00:20:10,786
Aside from that lump, are you okay, Yuuki?

243
00:20:11,175 --> 00:20:12,008
Yeah.

244
00:20:12,078 --> 00:20:15,115
Honestly, you two. I was really worried!

245
00:20:16,717 --> 00:20:17,803
I'm sorry.

246
00:20:17,951 --> 00:20:20,398
Good, glad the attitude's gone.

247
00:20:21,042 --> 00:20:25,531
So, that promise we made in
Odaiba. From now on, we keep it, okay?

248
00:20:27,035 --> 00:20:27,676
Okay.

249
00:20:28,393 --> 00:20:31,966
Good, then now we'll head to a
shelter area at a middle school.

250
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:33,974
Grab all our bags, won't you?

251
00:20:34,152 --> 00:20:35,493
Right! Huh? Right now?

252
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:38,487
We have to try to get there before sundown.

253
00:20:46,123 --> 00:20:48,191
Don't forget our promise.

254
00:20:49,044 --> 00:20:51,092
The three of us are going home together!

255
00:20:51,532 --> 00:20:52,569
Okay!

256
00:22:21,659 --> 00:22:25,674
At a school shelter area in Minato
ward. Victims there await relief.
