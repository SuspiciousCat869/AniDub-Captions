1
00:01:48,886 --> 00:01:50,312
So much smoke...

2
00:01:51,993 --> 00:01:56,080
So... I guess this isn't a dream...

3
00:01:58,045 --> 00:02:03,236
BURNING BRIDGE

4
00:02:09,141 --> 00:02:12,498
Hi, sis. Where do you think that nice lady went?

5
00:02:17,417 --> 00:02:18,873
I said I don't know.

6
00:02:19,206 --> 00:02:22,064
Stop asking me about everything. Will you?

7
00:02:25,506 --> 00:02:27,606
I told you, it'll be all right.

8
00:02:27,893 --> 00:02:30,732
If worse comes to worst,
we'll go home on our own.

9
00:02:36,894 --> 00:02:39,520
Oh, that's right. Maybe I can
get through on my phone.

10
00:02:52,164 --> 00:02:53,031
No luck?

11
00:02:53,134 --> 00:02:54,566
Not a bit.

12
00:02:55,012 --> 00:02:58,148
I hope.. I hope Dad and Mom aren't hurt.

13
00:03:00,289 --> 00:03:01,795
They're okay, right?

14
00:03:03,395 --> 00:03:07,007
Right? Right, Sis? Do you think Dad and Mom are...

15
00:03:07,032 --> 00:03:09,416
I don't know! I can't get through!

16
00:03:09,441 --> 00:03:12,747
And I told you, don't ask me all these questions
OK?

17
00:03:14,709 --> 00:03:18,794
Ah! Okay, you two. I'll bet you're hungry.

18
00:03:20,279 --> 00:03:22,781
You get cranky when your
stomach's empty, huh?

19
00:03:23,347 --> 00:03:24,971
Here. Breakfast.

20
00:03:28,089 --> 00:03:30,425
Thanks a lot, Miss Mari.

21
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:33,913
Just call me Mari, Yuuki.

22
00:03:36,602 --> 00:03:38,540
Oh! Rice balls!

23
00:03:38,669 --> 00:03:42,730
You can eat some if you like, Mirai.
We've got drinks, too.

24
00:03:43,452 --> 00:03:45,743
Why.. Why do you have these?

25
00:03:45,768 --> 00:03:51,121
I remembered that some convenience stores give out
food during emergencies, so I went to check that out.

26
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:56,133
You weren't here when I woke up,
so I thought you'd left us here.

27
00:03:57,754 --> 00:03:58,849
Oh-ho...

28
00:03:59,178 --> 00:04:01,886
You got lonely because I wasn't here, didn't you?

29
00:04:01,911 --> 00:04:03,410
You thought I'd run off.

30
00:04:03,952 --> 00:04:05,860
Not really, it's just...

31
00:04:05,885 --> 00:04:07,709
Okay then, let's make a promise.

32
00:04:08,384 --> 00:04:09,230
A promise?

33
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:13,173
Uh-huh. From now on,
no more going off on our own.

34
00:04:13,595 --> 00:04:16,591
No one leaves the group without
saying where they're going.

35
00:04:18,186 --> 00:04:18,948
Uh-huh.

36
00:04:19,488 --> 00:04:22,652
Why are you doing all this being nice to us?

37
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:23,350
Huh?

38
00:04:23,452 --> 00:04:26,139
I mean, you have a kid waiting for you at home.

39
00:04:26,406 --> 00:04:29,896
If you didn't stay with us,
you'd get back to her faster.

40
00:04:31,288 --> 00:04:33,408
Yeah, that may be true,

41
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:38,533
but my home's in the same direction as yours,
and maybe that's some sort of fate.

42
00:04:39,152 --> 00:04:41,455
So, let's go where we're going together.

43
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:41,993
Okay?

44
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:42,623
Uh!

45
00:04:43,306 --> 00:04:46,500
Are you sure? We'll just slow you down you know..

46
00:04:46,525 --> 00:04:48,003
Here. Eat this.

47
00:04:48,495 --> 00:04:49,981
Hunger breeds pessimism.

48
00:04:50,006 --> 00:04:52,026
You're just not happy when you are hungry.

49
00:04:53,661 --> 00:04:55,265
Smile and attack the day!

50
00:04:55,290 --> 00:04:56,837
Come on, let's eat!

51
00:04:58,111 --> 00:04:59,452
Umejiso plum.

52
00:04:59,522 --> 00:05:01,087
Thanks for giving the food!

53
00:05:04,433 --> 00:05:05,512
What's you get?

54
00:05:06,124 --> 00:05:07,601
I got salmon!

55
00:05:25,521 --> 00:05:27,211
Man, isn't it hot!

56
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:29,219
Whew, boy...

57
00:05:30,764 --> 00:05:33,550
Today's going to be a real summer scorcher.

58
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:36,062
I'll bet it's over 100.

59
00:05:37,102 --> 00:05:39,058
You talk like an old man.

60
00:05:39,444 --> 00:05:42,042
Oh? I get that a lot.

61
00:05:42,736 --> 00:05:45,579
Mirai, you are way too direct!

62
00:05:45,746 --> 00:05:47,456
C-Cut that out!

63
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:50,174
Give up?

64
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:54,378
Hi, sis, I'm thirsty.

65
00:05:58,606 --> 00:05:59,113
Here.

66
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:01,494
Thanks a lot.

67
00:06:02,373 --> 00:06:05,936
No problem. I'm glad I asked you to buy that yesterday.

68
00:06:08,082 --> 00:06:11,752
Okay, let's see if there's been any news.

69
00:06:13,521 --> 00:06:16,510
Since we'll drain the battery
if we watch for too long,

70
00:06:16,733 --> 00:06:19,188
we'll have to take a peek and then shut it off.

71
00:06:19,886 --> 00:06:20,450
Got it!

72
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:25,615
I'll now repeat the latest quake damage
report for the Tokyo metropolitan area.

73
00:06:26,456 --> 00:06:29,303
All transportation services
have ceased operation,

74
00:06:29,455 --> 00:06:32,396
with no restoration of service
seen in the near future.

75
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:35,400
Primary traffic restriction
rules are in effect,

76
00:06:35,662 --> 00:06:39,003
and all traffic has been banned within the boundary of Tamagawa,

77
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:42,503
route 246, as well as the #7 loop road.

78
00:06:43,051 --> 00:06:46,062
The confirmed death toll stands at 843,

79
00:06:46,285 --> 00:06:49,055
but with countless others either
missing or gravely injured,

80
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,932
that number is expected to rise.

81
00:06:51,678 --> 00:06:54,991
In addition, the sections of the city where
fires have started continue to...

82
00:06:55,435 --> 00:06:58,208
Oh my god. So many people dead...

83
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:01,086
The fire department held

84
00:07:01,133 --> 00:07:05,870
that anyone near these fire zones move to a shelter area as quickly as possible.

85
00:07:06,168 --> 00:07:09,899
Currently, a large number of quake
victims are walking back to their homes.

86
00:07:10,307 --> 00:07:12,159
We now turn to Prof. Noriaki Murata...

87
00:07:12,184 --> 00:07:16,250
of the Keihan University Disaster Research
Center for more information.

88
00:07:17,664 --> 00:07:20,494
Well, We are looking at upwards of six
and a half million people

89
00:07:20,519 --> 00:07:25,295
trying to make their way home due to
this near-field earthquake in Tokyo.

90
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:29,172
Related to that, how long do you think
the aftershocks will continue?

91
00:07:29,197 --> 00:07:32,323
We may possibly be seeing them
for the next three days

92
00:07:32,348 --> 00:07:36,781
up to level 5 on the Shindo scale.
Those making their way home may...

93
00:07:36,871 --> 00:07:38,665
I guess everyone's walking.

94
00:07:39,232 --> 00:07:43,104
No telling when the trains will start
running again in this situation.

95
00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:44,693
C'mon, Sis, let's go!

96
00:07:44,958 --> 00:07:46,482
Let's try walking, too!

97
00:07:46,614 --> 00:07:49,301
I feel a lot better now that I ate that rice ball!

98
00:07:49,565 --> 00:07:52,986
But, we live it Setagaya. It's so far...

99
00:07:53,932 --> 00:07:57,131
Doesn't seem like walking distance
at first thought.

100
00:07:58,031 --> 00:08:01,622
Are you serious? Odaiba's cut off?

101
00:08:02,045 --> 00:08:05,152
The bridge is on fire and the roads
are blocked all over the place.

102
00:08:05,890 --> 00:08:07,161
This place'll sink!

103
00:08:07,186 --> 00:08:08,529
We're in real trouble here.

104
00:08:08,554 --> 00:08:13,105
It's okay. This land isn't in any danger of sinking.
OK?

105
00:08:13,637 --> 00:08:17,083
But, I've heard that Odaiba's reclaimed land.

106
00:08:17,346 --> 00:08:19,396
Hey! There's shade over here.

107
00:08:20,567 --> 00:08:21,769
Daddy!

108
00:08:21,824 --> 00:08:24,328
I'm worried. We don't have any food or water.

109
00:08:24,353 --> 00:08:25,838
What are we going to do?

110
00:08:25,863 --> 00:08:28,531
Relax. There are people who live around here.

111
00:08:28,702 --> 00:08:29,840
Help will come soon.

112
00:08:31,459 --> 00:08:36,143
You're right. Let's be glad that the
whole family's together, at least.

113
00:08:36,207 --> 00:08:36,786
Let's!

114
00:08:38,766 --> 00:08:40,018
I miss them...

115
00:08:42,237 --> 00:08:43,793
Our Dad and Mom...

116
00:08:46,383 --> 00:08:48,312
Shall we try to walk it?

117
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:52,658
You want to get back to your dad and
mom as soon as you can, right?

118
00:08:53,008 --> 00:08:53,848
Uh-huh!

119
00:08:57,556 --> 00:08:59,167
This is the Coast Guard!

120
00:08:59,818 --> 00:09:03,019
We are transporting quake
victims via water bus.

121
00:09:03,821 --> 00:09:07,620
Anyone wishing transport from
Odaiba to Hinode pier,

122
00:09:07,707 --> 00:09:10,773
please assemble at the pier in Rainbow Park.

123
00:09:10,875 --> 00:09:12,729
Those wishing transport to the Chiba side,

124
00:09:12,754 --> 00:09:16,304
Okay! Looks like we take a boat to Hinode pier!

125
00:09:31,745 --> 00:09:32,816
Darn it...

126
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:37,174
You okay?

127
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:40,051
I never should have worn these sandals.

128
00:09:40,718 --> 00:09:42,268
They're giving me blisters.

129
00:09:42,293 --> 00:09:44,141
Oh? Let me see.

130
00:09:46,235 --> 00:09:48,212
Ooh, that looks painful.

131
00:09:48,662 --> 00:09:49,458
Hang on.

132
00:09:49,958 --> 00:09:52,742
One thing you always carry when you have a child.

133
00:09:52,774 --> 00:09:53,668
Band-aids.

134
00:09:54,919 --> 00:09:57,286
Hi, look at that. They got frogs on them!

135
00:09:57,778 --> 00:09:59,771
Sis is a certified Frog Worlder!

136
00:09:59,796 --> 00:10:00,844
Frog Worlder?

137
00:10:00,869 --> 00:10:03,995
En..Enough! You don't have to tell her that stuff!

138
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,834
But thanks, I'm happy to use them.

139
00:10:07,928 --> 00:10:09,190
Be my guest!

140
00:10:10,722 --> 00:10:12,237
You're lucky!

141
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:16,821
Think you can walk now?

142
00:10:18,924 --> 00:10:19,527
Yeah.

143
00:10:19,892 --> 00:10:23,905
I see. Well, if it comes to worst,
I can carry you piggy-back. Rabbit!

144
00:10:24,675 --> 00:10:25,916
Piggy-back!

145
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:28,519
Don't be stupid. I'm not a little kid.

146
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:31,367
Still, if you have any trouble, tell me.

147
00:10:31,501 --> 00:10:33,410
Seriously, I would carry you.

148
00:10:33,762 --> 00:10:36,073
I'm pretty sure my legs can handle it.

149
00:10:36,734 --> 00:10:38,591
It's okay, I'll walk by myself...

150
00:10:38,744 --> 00:10:40,434
Okay, that's the spirit!

151
00:10:41,374 --> 00:10:42,849
Well, shall we go?

152
00:10:57,285 --> 00:10:58,843
Your feet doing okay?

153
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:02,782
We are not in any big rush. Don't push yourself.

154
00:11:03,421 --> 00:11:06,557
I've been wondering,
will we really get on the boat?

155
00:11:07,274 --> 00:11:10,074
Look at all these people who want to get on, too.

156
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:11,054
Huh?

157
00:11:12,124 --> 00:11:13,529
We won't get on?

158
00:11:13,665 --> 00:11:15,584
Why don't we go and see first?

159
00:11:15,955 --> 00:11:17,909
C'mon, I'm sure it'll be fine.

160
00:11:18,683 --> 00:11:21,112
You're an optimist, aren't you, Mari?

161
00:11:21,741 --> 00:11:23,979
Well, more like I'm positive.

162
00:11:38,465 --> 00:11:39,551
Come on!

163
00:11:40,946 --> 00:11:42,085
Uh-oh.

164
00:11:45,549 --> 00:11:46,641
I'll help you.

165
00:11:46,859 --> 00:11:49,110
Oh! Thank you so much!

166
00:11:57,709 --> 00:12:00,559
Okay, ready, set... There we go!

167
00:12:01,977 --> 00:12:04,475
Thank you. You saved me.

168
00:12:04,531 --> 00:12:05,697
No problem.

169
00:12:10,153 --> 00:12:13,260
And now your turn! Up you go!

170
00:12:15,265 --> 00:12:17,307
Stick close to your mommy, okay?

171
00:12:19,354 --> 00:12:20,425
Okay!

172
00:12:21,131 --> 00:12:23,304
Really, thank you so much.

173
00:12:24,992 --> 00:12:26,473
We're almost to the pier.

174
00:12:27,479 --> 00:12:28,249
Right.

175
00:12:28,744 --> 00:12:30,810
Mari's so nice, Isn't she?

176
00:12:31,469 --> 00:12:33,982
More like she likes to butt in.

177
00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:39,116
Sorry about that.

178
00:12:39,282 --> 00:12:43,811
Yeah. Didn't you just promise that you
wouldn't leave the group without telling us first?

179
00:12:43,836 --> 00:12:45,016
What happened over that?

180
00:12:45,479 --> 00:12:47,687
Busted! I'm really sorry.

181
00:12:48,027 --> 00:12:51,555
No, it's okay. You did a really good thing!

182
00:12:59,004 --> 00:13:02,042
Everyone headed for Big Site,
keep moving straight!

183
00:13:02,319 --> 00:13:07,681
Those boarding the boat for Hamamatsu-Chou,
make a left at the intersection up ahead, please!

184
00:13:08,207 --> 00:13:10,636
Wow, this is getting really messy.

185
00:13:10,917 --> 00:13:15,309
This is the only place to go for people who want to
go home before the train start again.

186
00:13:19,278 --> 00:13:20,958
So we don't get split up.

187
00:13:23,584 --> 00:13:25,472
Mirai, give me your hand, too.

188
00:13:26,825 --> 00:13:30,263
I'll be fine. I told you, I'm not a little kid.

189
00:13:30,319 --> 00:13:34,085
Then keep close. Don't get separated from us.
You got that?

190
00:13:52,443 --> 00:13:53,060
Wait...

191
00:13:56,017 --> 00:13:56,885
Mari!

192
00:14:01,685 --> 00:14:02,774
Yuuki!

193
00:14:15,988 --> 00:14:16,942
Yuuki...

194
00:14:17,978 --> 00:14:19,593
Outta the way! Keep moving!

195
00:14:24,841 --> 00:14:27,022
Yuuki? Mari?

196
00:14:30,318 --> 00:14:31,384
Where are they?

197
00:14:31,876 --> 00:14:34,356
Hey! Don't just stop here!

198
00:14:36,294 --> 00:14:36,732
Mirai!

199
00:14:36,757 --> 00:14:37,241
N-No!

200
00:14:38,805 --> 00:14:39,521
Mari!

201
00:14:41,072 --> 00:14:42,198
We are here, Sis!

202
00:14:43,142 --> 00:14:43,960
Yuuki..

203
00:14:46,667 --> 00:14:48,657
I think you'd better hold my hand.

204
00:14:56,187 --> 00:14:58,359
Don't let go of my hands.

205
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:04,110
Again?!

206
00:15:07,846 --> 00:15:09,115
It's okay.

207
00:15:36,411 --> 00:15:38,664
That was like an explosion. Wasn't it

208
00:15:38,728 --> 00:15:41,372
I can't believe the expressway collapsed.

209
00:15:48,641 --> 00:15:50,260
What's wrong? Are you okay?

210
00:15:53,281 --> 00:15:55,624
Screw that! We'll never get across the bridge!

211
00:15:55,649 --> 00:15:57,847
Damn it! That booms the only way.

212
00:15:57,872 --> 00:15:58,699
Move it!

213
00:16:05,008 --> 00:16:05,714
Not hurt?

214
00:16:05,929 --> 00:16:06,604
Uh.

215
00:16:06,683 --> 00:16:07,509
Can you walk?

216
00:16:07,898 --> 00:16:08,309
Uh.

217
00:16:08,444 --> 00:16:09,266
Let's go!

218
00:16:10,455 --> 00:16:13,648
This vessel is going to switch
over to sea rescue operations!

219
00:16:14,047 --> 00:16:16,296
Please board the water bus immediately!

220
00:16:16,388 --> 00:16:18,367
Do not board this vessel!

221
00:16:27,083 --> 00:16:29,296
Hang on to my hand, no matter what.

222
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:29,837
Uh.

223
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:31,607
You too, Mirai.

224
00:16:31,685 --> 00:16:32,252
Uh.

225
00:16:35,398 --> 00:16:36,836
Wait! That hurts!

226
00:16:45,739 --> 00:16:46,661
Yuuki!

227
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:47,964
Mari!

228
00:16:49,515 --> 00:16:50,372
Yuuki!

229
00:16:50,686 --> 00:16:51,809
Sis! Sis!

230
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:53,208
Yuuki!

231
00:16:54,812 --> 00:16:55,781
Yuuki.

232
00:16:58,996 --> 00:17:00,071
Yuuki!

233
00:17:02,713 --> 00:17:03,574
Sis!

234
00:17:06,077 --> 00:17:07,254
Sis!

235
00:17:11,617 --> 00:17:12,759
SIS!

236
00:17:15,382 --> 00:17:16,431
Sis...

237
00:17:17,417 --> 00:17:18,264
Yuuki!

238
00:17:25,167 --> 00:17:25,967
Yuuki!

239
00:17:27,089 --> 00:17:28,229
Sis!

240
00:17:38,071 --> 00:17:39,988
The boat will be departing soon!

241
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:42,674
Please give priority to the weak and injured!

242
00:17:42,738 --> 00:17:45,906
So many people... Maybe we should take the next
boat.

243
00:17:46,264 --> 00:17:48,329
Let's just give it a try. Shall we?

244
00:17:49,281 --> 00:17:53,413
Those who wish to board,
please wait for the next boat!

245
00:17:54,628 --> 00:17:55,780
No luck.

246
00:17:58,232 --> 00:18:00,627
You kids there! Get aboard, quick!

247
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:07,604
You too, Mom! Move it!

248
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,191
R-Right!

249
00:18:21,054 --> 00:18:21,971
You okay?

250
00:18:23,391 --> 00:18:25,351
Please wait for the next boat!

251
00:18:25,682 --> 00:18:28,081
Calm down! Be careful!

252
00:18:38,534 --> 00:18:39,741
This is awful.

253
00:18:40,257 --> 00:18:43,730
Yeah. This isn't exactly an ideal situation.

254
00:18:45,028 --> 00:18:47,575
Still, we got on the boat. Didn't we?

255
00:18:48,535 --> 00:18:50,618
You've got a lot of nerve. Don't you?

256
00:18:50,935 --> 00:18:54,773
The guy calls you "mom" and you're all like
"Right! Let's' go".

257
00:18:56,061 --> 00:18:58,857
I guess I have gotten tougher
since my husband died.

258
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:01,445
It has't been easy for me since then.

259
00:19:01,556 --> 00:19:05,639
Even though I'm alone,
I guess I just want to try to bring up Hina well.

260
00:19:07,932 --> 00:19:10,438
Look... The bridge.

261
00:19:11,032 --> 00:19:12,711
It's still on fire.

262
00:19:13,224 --> 00:19:16,516
I see that looks like a tanker truck's burning.

263
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:22,366
What's...?

264
00:19:43,063 --> 00:19:43,805
Uh-oh...

265
00:19:54,543 --> 00:19:55,501
No way..

266
00:19:55,764 --> 00:19:58,346
Mommy! People are falling!

267
00:19:58,371 --> 00:20:01,262
If we'd been a little slower,
we'd have been on that one!

268
00:20:01,383 --> 00:20:04,011
Look out! It's coming toward us!

269
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:30,350
If we'd been on that boat, then...

270
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:34,346
Mari?

271
00:20:34,530 --> 00:20:34,925
You..

272
00:20:36,066 --> 00:20:39,534
I'm sorry. For putting you in danger like that.

273
00:20:44,291 --> 00:20:45,675
Thank you, Mari.

274
00:22:21,518 --> 00:22:25,451
Tokyo Tower collapses! Desperate rescue efforts continue!
