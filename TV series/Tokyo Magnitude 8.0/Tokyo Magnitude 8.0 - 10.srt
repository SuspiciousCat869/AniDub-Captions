1
00:01:42,409 --> 00:01:44,816
...and increasing damage from house collapses

2
00:01:44,816 --> 00:01:48,778
and secondary disasters due to
the repeated aftershocks is feared.

3
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,218
Unless absolutely necessary...

4
00:01:50,243 --> 00:01:52,829
Yuuki, do you need to throw up?

5
00:01:53,605 --> 00:01:54,408
No.

6
00:01:54,909 --> 00:01:57,294
What's wrong? Are you sick or something?

7
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:01,789
Then what?

8
00:02:05,235 --> 00:02:08,217
Sis... I... Listen...

9
00:02:10,948 --> 00:02:15,163
SIS, LISTEN...

10
00:02:20,005 --> 00:02:20,775
What is it?

11
00:02:23,131 --> 00:02:24,073
Listen...

12
00:02:25,641 --> 00:02:27,808
What's the matter? Just tell me.

13
00:02:28,997 --> 00:02:31,739
Listen... Just suppose...

14
00:02:32,297 --> 00:02:38,047
If I... If I died... What would you do?

15
00:02:43,208 --> 00:02:47,050
That's ridiculous! Don't say stupid things like that!

16
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:56,057
If you died... Dad and Mom would cry themselves to death.

17
00:02:58,984 --> 00:03:00,069
So would I.

18
00:03:01,346 --> 00:03:05,093
So, please, don't talk about dying anymore. OK?

19
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,407
Sorry...

20
00:03:13,058 --> 00:03:15,470
Anyway, when we get home

21
00:03:15,716 --> 00:03:19,284
let's tell Dad and Mom about
everything that happened to us, right?

22
00:03:20,037 --> 00:03:23,479
I'll tell them how you were really strong the whole time.

23
00:03:23,504 --> 00:03:26,927
Don't worry, I'll tell them how strong you were, too, sis!

24
00:03:27,025 --> 00:03:28,268
You were cool!

25
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:31,415
And we have to give Mom her birthday present.

26
00:03:32,828 --> 00:03:34,634
I'll tell her that you picked it out.

27
00:03:35,361 --> 00:03:39,527
Well, sis. Not much farther,
and then we'll be home, won't we?

28
00:03:39,948 --> 00:03:40,598
Uh-huh

29
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,593
listen, Yuuki.

30
00:03:42,894 --> 00:03:43,426
Uh?

31
00:03:43,973 --> 00:03:46,598
Summer break's only just started, you know?

32
00:03:46,875 --> 00:03:48,576
Once things settle down a little bit

33
00:03:49,026 --> 00:03:51,062
let's do nothing but have fun!

34
00:03:51,172 --> 00:03:54,544
Last year I was so busy studying, I didn't have any fun.

35
00:03:56,520 --> 00:04:01,724
I envied you then, because you didn't
have an exam that you had to go in and take.

36
00:04:02,382 --> 00:04:06,895
But it was boring for you, too,
not having me take you anywhere, huh?

37
00:04:07,972 --> 00:04:10,288
Uh-uh. I played with Itsuki.

38
00:04:10,629 --> 00:04:15,441
Besides, sometimes you drew me pictures
of frogs, and I liked that, it was fun.

39
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:19,306
What? Those terrible pictures?

40
00:04:19,438 --> 00:04:21,020
They weren't terrible!

41
00:04:21,398 --> 00:04:22,721
Yes, they were!

42
00:04:23,982 --> 00:04:25,121
They were cute!

43
00:04:28,261 --> 00:04:29,571
You're so weird!

44
00:04:46,031 --> 00:04:48,172
Yuuki, look! A horse!

45
00:04:48,416 --> 00:04:49,625
It sure is.

46
00:04:49,684 --> 00:04:51,704
Now, be gentle when you touch him.

47
00:04:54,135 --> 00:04:56,066
Hey, Let's come back here together.

48
00:04:56,596 --> 00:04:57,307
Uh-huh.

49
00:05:08,788 --> 00:05:10,773
Yuuki, we're almost there!

50
00:05:10,952 --> 00:05:11,678
Uh-huh.

51
00:05:15,573 --> 00:05:18,401
Isn't that your friend's place, Yuuki?

52
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:22,260
Yeah... Kazu's house.

53
00:05:24,356 --> 00:05:26,013
I hope our house is okay.

54
00:05:53,649 --> 00:05:54,598
Mirai!

55
00:05:56,195 --> 00:05:57,194
Hey!

56
00:06:00,339 --> 00:06:01,346
Mayu!

57
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:03,670
Mirai! You're okay!

58
00:06:03,985 --> 00:06:05,098
And you!

59
00:06:05,885 --> 00:06:07,412
Thank goodness!

60
00:06:09,577 --> 00:06:11,974
Mayu, what... Huh? Hey!

61
00:06:12,476 --> 00:06:16,530
Cut it out! C'mon, Mayu, quit fooling around.

62
00:06:16,555 --> 00:06:18,952
But, I couldn't get in touch with you at all!

63
00:06:19,671 --> 00:06:23,905
I asked your mom, but she said there
wasn't any word on where either of you were!

64
00:06:25,618 --> 00:06:27,599
Mayu! You were with my mom?!

65
00:06:27,685 --> 00:06:28,702
Uh-huh...

66
00:06:28,727 --> 00:06:31,380
I ran into her at the shelter at the elementary school.

67
00:06:31,635 --> 00:06:33,423
She was so worried.

68
00:06:33,448 --> 00:06:34,854
She got in touch with your dad

69
00:06:34,879 --> 00:06:38,126
but she said you and your little
brother went off to Odaiba by yourselves.

70
00:06:38,238 --> 00:06:40,097
And that she couldn't reach you at all!

71
00:06:41,113 --> 00:06:44,912
I see... so Dad and Mom are all right.

72
00:06:45,327 --> 00:06:46,102
Uh-huh.

73
00:06:46,185 --> 00:06:50,179
She said your dad got hurt at his
office, but it's nothing serious.

74
00:06:50,637 --> 00:06:53,905
Your mom's been going crazy, worrying about you two.

75
00:06:55,224 --> 00:06:56,910
Thanks for telling me.

76
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,388
Is everyone at your home okay?

77
00:07:00,112 --> 00:07:01,326
Yeah, they're fine.

78
00:07:01,351 --> 00:07:05,712
Everyone's at home, but my mom's
in the last month of her pregnancy,

79
00:07:05,737 --> 00:07:07,404
so we brought her here, just to be safe.

80
00:07:07,429 --> 00:07:09,285
Thank goodness, they're all right.

81
00:07:10,097 --> 00:07:10,669
Yeah...

82
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:13,745
Except I still haven't gotten in touch with Yuka.

83
00:07:14,248 --> 00:07:17,158
I don't know what's happened to anyone else in our class.

84
00:07:19,714 --> 00:07:23,355
I ran into Megu the day before yesterday,

85
00:07:24,156 --> 00:07:26,908
but it looked like her mom had died.

86
00:07:31,521 --> 00:07:34,417
What do you think What'll happen now, Mirai?

87
00:07:35,295 --> 00:07:37,831
I wonder if school will start when it should.

88
00:07:41,038 --> 00:07:43,388
By the way, where's your little brother?

89
00:07:44,413 --> 00:07:47,094
Huh? He was right there a minute ago.

90
00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:48,035
Oh...

91
00:07:49,547 --> 00:07:51,730
Anyway, I'm glad you're both okay!

92
00:07:52,035 --> 00:07:55,005
You should hurry up and get to the
elementary school and see your mom.

93
00:07:55,902 --> 00:07:56,392
Uh.

94
00:07:57,670 --> 00:07:58,212
Bye-bye!

95
00:07:58,237 --> 00:08:00,970
Once things settle down, I'll come see how you're doing!

96
00:08:02,944 --> 00:08:04,362
Why, you little...!

97
00:08:07,453 --> 00:08:09,407
Come back here, you little brats!

98
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:21,998
Yuuki! I told you not to run off!

99
00:08:24,767 --> 00:08:28,325
C'mon, Yuuki! Where are you running off to now?

100
00:08:28,871 --> 00:08:30,277
To the school!

101
00:08:39,499 --> 00:08:41,053
Yuuki!

102
00:08:46,198 --> 00:08:47,749
I said wait!

103
00:08:52,653 --> 00:08:53,817
Oh man.

104
00:09:10,983 --> 00:09:11,848
Hey, Itsuki.

105
00:09:12,664 --> 00:09:14,554
Oh! The Cell Phonian!

106
00:09:15,672 --> 00:09:19,401
That's not my name. Didn't I tell you I'm Mirai, remember?

107
00:09:19,683 --> 00:09:20,409
Mirai.

108
00:09:20,751 --> 00:09:22,801
Yup. Hey, Itsuki?

109
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:27,719
Did you see Yuuki? I just saw him run through the gate.

110
00:09:28,106 --> 00:09:29,975
Yuuki?! He's here?!

111
00:09:30,526 --> 00:09:32,687
Yeah. We heard our mom was here.

112
00:09:33,523 --> 00:09:35,877
Well, maybe he went over the the gym.

113
00:09:36,448 --> 00:09:38,944
That's where your mom and everyone are taking shelter.

114
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:45,355
Is your family all right, Itsuki?

115
00:09:45,664 --> 00:09:47,898
Yeah, but our house is wrecked.

116
00:09:48,145 --> 00:09:49,159
Oh, Really?

117
00:09:49,184 --> 00:09:49,916
Uh.

118
00:10:01,152 --> 00:10:03,049
So, do you know where my mom is?

119
00:10:03,515 --> 00:10:04,399
Over there!

120
00:10:10,979 --> 00:10:12,363
Oh... Looks like she's out.

121
00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:24,447
Mom?

122
00:10:24,688 --> 00:10:25,924
Where's Yuuki's mom?

123
00:10:27,478 --> 00:10:29,563
Why? Is something wrong?

124
00:10:32,804 --> 00:10:35,411
She just left to get some fresh clothes from home.

125
00:10:36,173 --> 00:10:38,163
I heard your dad is still in the hospital.

126
00:10:38,188 --> 00:10:39,554
So he couldn't go himself.

127
00:10:39,579 --> 00:10:40,715
The hospital?

128
00:10:40,752 --> 00:10:42,847
Oh! But they say it's not serious!

129
00:10:43,047 --> 00:10:44,807
It looks like he's okay.

130
00:10:46,831 --> 00:10:49,543
Your mom really has been worried sick about you.

131
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:52,427
You should let see you're okay as soon as you can.

132
00:10:52,936 --> 00:10:56,441
You still might be able to catch up. Go after her!

133
00:10:56,898 --> 00:11:00,120
OK. I'll go home just as soon as I find Yuuki.

134
00:11:00,675 --> 00:11:01,961
Thank you very much.

135
00:11:06,304 --> 00:11:07,589
Yuuki!

136
00:11:07,614 --> 00:11:08,859
Yuuki!

137
00:11:10,666 --> 00:11:13,943
Hmm... We can try the athletic field, next.

138
00:11:19,245 --> 00:11:20,435
Has it grown a little?

139
00:11:20,773 --> 00:11:23,169
I feel like I haven't seen it in ages.

140
00:11:29,335 --> 00:11:31,993
Maybe if we wait here, Yuuki will come.

141
00:11:32,741 --> 00:11:33,604
Yeah...

142
00:11:41,882 --> 00:11:42,600
Yuuki...

143
00:11:50,291 --> 00:11:50,896
Yuuki?

144
00:11:54,074 --> 00:11:54,884
Yuuki!

145
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:57,682
Oh, that stupid...!

146
00:11:57,751 --> 00:11:59,666
Huh? Wait for me!

147
00:12:18,426 --> 00:12:20,894
I wanted to give Yuuki our marronnier journal.

148
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:22,509
Marronnier journal?

149
00:12:23,002 --> 00:12:26,757
Yeah, it's an exchange journal.
It was Yuuki's turn to write in it.

150
00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:28,926
You two were doing that?

151
00:12:29,789 --> 00:12:30,532
Yeah.

152
00:12:30,890 --> 00:12:33,592
Yuuki said we should both write in it when we started.

153
00:12:34,555 --> 00:12:35,985
Yuuki?

154
00:12:36,437 --> 00:12:37,444
Yuuki!

155
00:12:39,242 --> 00:12:40,276
Yuuki?

156
00:12:41,486 --> 00:12:43,068
Yuuki!

157
00:12:46,644 --> 00:12:47,766
Yuuki!

158
00:12:54,009 --> 00:12:57,860
Darn it, Yuuki! Why did you just run off like that?!

159
00:12:58,156 --> 00:12:59,579
I was looking for you!

160
00:12:59,797 --> 00:13:02,955
Yeah... Sorry about that, Sis.

161
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:04,217
Yuuki?

162
00:13:05,545 --> 00:13:06,531
Yuuki?

163
00:13:08,065 --> 00:13:08,787
Found him?

164
00:13:08,881 --> 00:13:09,549
Yeah.

165
00:13:09,776 --> 00:13:11,799
Yuuki, Itsuki was also...

166
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:13,989
What's the...

167
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:17,628
Did he go to the toilet?

168
00:13:18,007 --> 00:13:21,362
That toilet's dirty. I mean it's really gross.

169
00:13:21,666 --> 00:13:23,054
This is our classroom.

170
00:13:26,046 --> 00:13:28,549
Here's my seat, and this one's Yuuki's.

171
00:13:33,133 --> 00:13:34,346
They're so little!

172
00:13:35,027 --> 00:13:37,572
Were the desks always this small and cute?

173
00:13:38,412 --> 00:13:40,518
And look at all the doodles he made.

174
00:13:41,554 --> 00:13:42,661
Oh, Yuuki...

175
00:13:45,773 --> 00:13:46,533
Couldn't..

176
00:13:47,171 --> 00:13:50,576
And over here, they hung the
pictures we drew on the bulletin board.

177
00:13:50,638 --> 00:13:51,314
Look!

178
00:13:58,060 --> 00:13:59,395
That's Yuuki's picture.

179
00:14:06,086 --> 00:14:09,273
"In first grade, my family crossed the bridge to Odaiba."

180
00:14:09,298 --> 00:14:11,950
"It was lots of fun. Yuuki Onozawa."

181
00:14:15,087 --> 00:14:16,224
Yuuki...

182
00:14:17,308 --> 00:14:20,736
Yuuki told me that he wanted to
go back to the bridge with everyone.

183
00:14:24,653 --> 00:14:26,913
<i>The reason I wanted to go to Odaiba...</i>

184
00:14:27,017 --> 00:14:29,753
was 'cuz I wanted us to see the bridge together.

185
00:14:35,017 --> 00:14:36,982
What...? Why am I...?

186
00:14:38,701 --> 00:14:39,437
Mirai?

187
00:14:40,201 --> 00:14:42,790
It's strange... What's wrong with me?

188
00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:45,642
Um... I'll go look for Yuuki!

189
00:14:55,168 --> 00:14:57,886
Why? Why am I crying?

190
00:15:00,547 --> 00:15:01,931
Yuuki...!

191
00:15:04,909 --> 00:15:06,134
Why...?!

192
00:15:07,078 --> 00:15:09,089
Sis, don't cry.

193
00:15:10,745 --> 00:15:12,409
I'm here beside you.

194
00:15:13,711 --> 00:15:14,500
Yuuki...

195
00:15:21,103 --> 00:15:21,517
Darn it...

196
00:15:21,542 --> 00:15:24,072
Next time you run off, I'm gonna get really mad!

197
00:15:27,451 --> 00:15:30,883
Elementary school kids are good at calligraphy these days.

198
00:15:30,908 --> 00:15:32,756
Can you tell which one's mine?

199
00:15:33,370 --> 00:15:36,427
Let's see... Ah! Found it!

200
00:15:36,796 --> 00:15:37,665
Got it!

201
00:15:38,388 --> 00:15:39,656
It's good, huh?

202
00:15:40,136 --> 00:15:41,217
It's too big.

203
00:15:41,972 --> 00:15:44,473
But I can tell you put a lot of work into it.

204
00:15:45,793 --> 00:15:48,796
I can tell. Because I'm your sister.

205
00:15:49,758 --> 00:15:53,365
Yeah. I work hard because I love your name, Sis.

206
00:15:56,968 --> 00:15:58,760
Yuuki wasn't in the toilet.

207
00:15:59,968 --> 00:16:02,719
Yeah. Sorry. He's right here...

208
00:16:05,596 --> 00:16:09,948
Huh? But, he was just here, sitting on this desk..

209
00:16:10,861 --> 00:16:14,324
Oh... He never could keep still.

210
00:16:15,393 --> 00:16:17,900
Always running around, all over...

211
00:16:18,823 --> 00:16:20,027
Getting lost...

212
00:16:25,454 --> 00:16:26,767
Um, sorry.

213
00:16:27,586 --> 00:16:30,404
I'm... gonna go get our marronnier journal.

214
00:16:30,601 --> 00:16:32,145
My house is right near here.

215
00:16:34,090 --> 00:16:36,171
Wait. I'll go with you.

216
00:16:37,074 --> 00:16:38,819
I'm going to go find my mom.

217
00:16:40,652 --> 00:16:41,809
Okay, but...

218
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:44,070
I'm sorry.

219
00:16:44,619 --> 00:16:47,155
I'm okay now. Let's go.

220
00:17:06,703 --> 00:17:09,916
Itsuki! Get the journal some other time!

221
00:17:10,072 --> 00:17:12,051
It's dangerous! Come out!

222
00:17:12,710 --> 00:17:15,206
It's fine! I came here this morning, too!

223
00:17:16,503 --> 00:17:17,646
Where's Yuuki?

224
00:17:18,378 --> 00:17:19,217
Sis!

225
00:17:19,874 --> 00:17:21,180
I'll go get Itsuki!

226
00:17:21,651 --> 00:17:23,643
Yuuki, no! Come back!

227
00:17:24,016 --> 00:17:25,140
Oh, you little...

228
00:17:25,767 --> 00:17:26,565
Oh...!

229
00:17:27,441 --> 00:17:30,738
Itsuki! That's enough. Come down.

230
00:17:30,763 --> 00:17:31,824
Almost got it.

231
00:17:33,311 --> 00:17:34,068
Found it!

232
00:17:35,222 --> 00:17:36,116
Here you go.

233
00:17:37,368 --> 00:17:39,008
Would you give it to Yuuki for me?

234
00:17:39,443 --> 00:17:40,032
Uh-huh.

235
00:17:46,425 --> 00:17:49,519
"July 20th. Planted the marronnier with Itsuki."

236
00:17:49,647 --> 00:17:52,011
"Sis called the marronnier 'macaroni'."

237
00:17:52,036 --> 00:17:54,111
"I think it's because she likes to eat."

238
00:17:57,837 --> 00:18:00,808
What is this? He made that all up.

239
00:18:05,663 --> 00:18:09,353
Thanks a lot, Itsuki. I'll
make sure he gets it right away.

240
00:18:09,865 --> 00:18:10,486
Sure.

241
00:18:11,389 --> 00:18:11,972
Yuuki.

242
00:18:13,355 --> 00:18:14,937
Oh, where did you go?

243
00:18:15,328 --> 00:18:17,438
You told me you were going to call Itsuki!

244
00:18:18,351 --> 00:18:21,092
What were you doing? Come on, let's go home.

245
00:18:21,611 --> 00:18:25,198
That means you too, Itsuki. You
have to get back to the shelter, right?

246
00:18:25,286 --> 00:18:27,304
Um... Yeah.

247
00:18:29,745 --> 00:18:31,685
Itsuki! Come on!

248
00:18:36,508 --> 00:18:37,627
Yuuki!

249
00:18:39,564 --> 00:18:40,557
Yuuki!

250
00:18:42,848 --> 00:18:43,783
Itsuki!

251
00:19:03,921 --> 00:19:05,372
Itsuki, are you okay?

252
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:06,376
Yeah...

253
00:19:06,809 --> 00:19:07,939
Yuuki, are you...

254
00:19:21,305 --> 00:19:22,435
Sis... I...

255
00:19:23,375 --> 00:19:24,189
Yuuki...

256
00:19:46,964 --> 00:19:48,833
Tokyo Fire Department.

257
00:20:37,581 --> 00:20:38,780
I'm sorry.

258
00:20:40,111 --> 00:20:40,875
Yuuki...

259
00:20:42,789 --> 00:20:44,915
Hey, sis, listen...

260
00:20:46,915 --> 00:20:47,735
I...

261
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:48,526
Yuuki!

262
00:20:52,326 --> 00:20:53,039
I...

263
00:20:54,456 --> 00:20:55,581
I died.

264
00:22:21,582 --> 00:22:25,453
What message is left for family
lost in the Great Tokyo Earthquake?
