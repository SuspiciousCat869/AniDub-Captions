1
00:01:24,737 --> 00:01:28,270
Someone said that noise before
was Tokyo Tower coming down!

2
00:01:28,295 --> 00:01:29,212
Seriously?!

3
00:01:42,849 --> 00:01:43,668
What's wrong?

4
00:01:50,873 --> 00:01:54,353
Tokyo tower really did fall, didn't it?

5
00:01:56,328 --> 00:01:57,909
SCHOOLHOUSE OF LAMENTATION

6
00:01:57,934 --> 00:02:00,097
I could see it from my classroom..

7
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:02,050
Tokyo Tower...

8
00:02:02,121 --> 00:02:05,943
Is that around here? Just what's
the school it is you go to, Mirai?

9
00:02:06,205 --> 00:02:08,250
It's Rikka Girls' Academy.

10
00:02:08,366 --> 00:02:09,044
Really?!

11
00:02:10,858 --> 00:02:13,360
That's where the shelter area we're headed for is.

12
00:02:13,408 --> 00:02:15,555
What? No way! Really?

13
00:02:16,374 --> 00:02:19,687
I'm impressed, Mirai. That's a prestigious school.

14
00:02:20,266 --> 00:02:23,262
No... I barely passed getting in.

15
00:02:23,612 --> 00:02:25,945
I heard it was renovated just recently.

16
00:02:26,234 --> 00:02:28,188
One of the municipal workers told me

17
00:02:28,213 --> 00:02:31,506
that was why the buildings in
this area have so little damage.

18
00:02:32,872 --> 00:02:37,100
Yeah, the building construction is
new, but it's designed to looks old.

19
00:02:38,528 --> 00:02:40,915
Mom liked that about it, too.

20
00:02:47,025 --> 00:02:50,222
Mom also said it was the school she wanted to go to.

21
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:54,794
That's why she was so happy when
sis was accepted that mom fell down.

22
00:02:54,948 --> 00:02:56,150
She fell down?

23
00:02:56,175 --> 00:02:56,979
Uh-huh!

24
00:02:59,263 --> 00:03:01,851
That was at the school's entrance ceremony.

25
00:03:05,935 --> 00:03:07,445
Wha...?! Mom!

26
00:03:08,214 --> 00:03:13,035
Oh...! Stop tripping over nothing! You're embarrassing us!

27
00:03:19,464 --> 00:03:21,713
Ow, ow, ow...

28
00:03:22,002 --> 00:03:24,628
Oh, no. Now what do I do?

29
00:03:26,472 --> 00:03:29,423
It was her fault for wearing such high heels.

30
00:03:29,448 --> 00:03:31,627
That scrape looked like it really hurt.

31
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:36,267
I don't care, but... She was
in such a bad mood after that.

32
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:45,096
You know, she was probably just angry with herself.

33
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:50,091
Doing something like that at
her daughter's entrance ceremony.

34
00:03:50,477 --> 00:03:53,589
If it had been me, I probably would have cried.

35
00:03:59,145 --> 00:04:00,740
You're like her, aren't you?

36
00:04:01,216 --> 00:04:03,246
What?! I'm not like her! At all!

37
00:04:03,271 --> 00:04:05,071
No, you totally are!

38
00:04:05,096 --> 00:04:06,159
I'm totally not!

39
00:04:06,184 --> 00:04:08,153
"Mommy has to go out!"

40
00:04:40,871 --> 00:04:43,404
Keep away from the school building, please!

41
00:04:44,364 --> 00:04:47,703
Somehow, it doesn't seem like my school.

42
00:04:48,695 --> 00:04:51,404
Is there anyone who hasn't gotten water yet?

43
00:04:52,014 --> 00:04:54,174
Anyone who hasn't gotten water?

44
00:04:57,015 --> 00:04:59,462
You must be thirsty. Have some water.

45
00:04:59,803 --> 00:05:01,390
Oh. Thank you.

46
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:03,982
Have you been to the hospital yet?

47
00:05:04,378 --> 00:05:08,769
Yes. I went, but it's so crowded
that there was no one to see him.

48
00:05:10,401 --> 00:05:12,976
There's lots of people here who are hurt, huh?

49
00:05:13,222 --> 00:05:17,082
There are a lot of hospitals located
in this part of the city, Yuuki.

50
00:05:17,449 --> 00:05:20,014
Looks like they're all full up, though.

51
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,201
It's hard to believe.

52
00:05:24,278 --> 00:05:26,719
That you go to school here, Mirai.

53
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:30,566
Yeah, but...

54
00:05:31,082 --> 00:05:34,172
I feel like we've come to some
place I've never seen before.

55
00:05:34,676 --> 00:05:36,101
That's not surprising.

56
00:05:36,614 --> 00:05:41,393
Still, we feel a lot better with you
here, since you know the place so well.

57
00:05:41,488 --> 00:05:42,727
Isn't that right?

58
00:05:44,365 --> 00:05:48,069
Besides, I always kind of wanted
to come to see your school, Sis.

59
00:05:48,519 --> 00:05:51,787
But it's a girls' school, so I
figured they wouldn't let me in.

60
00:05:52,643 --> 00:05:55,258
You could come visit during the culture fair.

61
00:05:55,930 --> 00:05:57,689
Not like I'd invite you...

62
00:06:01,297 --> 00:06:02,642
Oh, yeah! Yuuki!

63
00:06:05,157 --> 00:06:07,693
Come on, I'm gonna show you something cool.

64
00:06:09,054 --> 00:06:09,907
This way!

65
00:06:23,636 --> 00:06:26,937
Hey, Sis. What's in here?

66
00:06:27,123 --> 00:06:30,710
Stained glass windows. Will you see? They're SO pretty!

67
00:06:35,695 --> 00:06:37,104
Look! Over there!

68
00:07:09,001 --> 00:07:09,759
Mom...?

69
00:07:12,505 --> 00:07:13,235
Megu...

70
00:07:42,037 --> 00:07:43,391
Soufflés...

71
00:07:44,209 --> 00:07:45,955
Megu mentioned it once.

72
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:49,442
That.. That her mom made her soufflés...

73
00:07:51,568 --> 00:07:54,860
It's not like Megu and I were really close or anything.

74
00:07:56,294 --> 00:08:00,844
I.. I kind of disliked her, actually, but...

75
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:02,574
But I hated...

76
00:08:02,801 --> 00:08:06,904
Seeing her that sad... I just hated it.

77
00:08:10,282 --> 00:08:12,353
I couldn't do anything to help her.

78
00:08:16,866 --> 00:08:18,755
What can any of us do?

79
00:08:19,095 --> 00:08:20,779
In the end, about this.

80
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:28,196
It's been one day since the quake,

81
00:08:28,323 --> 00:08:31,769
but we've yet to receive detailed
damage reports from all areas.

82
00:08:32,357 --> 00:08:35,124
However, according to the Tokyo Fire Department,

83
00:08:35,274 --> 00:08:37,568
we've gotten word that 200,000
homes have been lost to fires,

84
00:08:37,593 --> 00:08:41,185
Doesn't seem much cooler, even though it's nighttime now.

85
00:08:44,077 --> 00:08:45,928
Yeah, you're right.

86
00:08:47,966 --> 00:08:49,701
But I have a secret..

87
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:52,378
I know of a place.

88
00:08:52,585 --> 00:08:54,875
A place that's a tiny bit cooler.

89
00:09:03,982 --> 00:09:07,458
This place is a little bit cooler, thanks to the water.

90
00:09:10,522 --> 00:09:12,848
I can imagine you've been through a lot,

91
00:09:14,017 --> 00:09:16,834
but please, at least get some rest tonight.

92
00:09:17,262 --> 00:09:19,123
Pardon me, but, who are you?

93
00:09:19,893 --> 00:09:24,366
My name's Furuichi, and as you
can see, I'm just an old man.

94
00:09:24,536 --> 00:09:28,761
I can't do very much to help, but at the very least

95
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:31,891
I can lead you some place a little cooler.

96
00:10:03,205 --> 00:10:04,987
They looked like this.

97
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:08,771
The stained glass windows I wanted to show you, Yuuki.

98
00:10:09,308 --> 00:10:12,837
They sparkled like this. So pretty...

99
00:10:37,049 --> 00:10:41,576
It may not be a birthday cake,
but I like the moon when it's round.

100
00:10:41,782 --> 00:10:43,934
Like a big, tasty pancake.

101
00:10:44,606 --> 00:10:47,334
I like crescent moons. I like the name.

102
00:10:48,319 --> 00:10:50,822
Oh! Say, did you know this?

103
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:53,713
Some people call the crescent moon a "paper moon".

104
00:10:55,050 --> 00:10:57,788
Oh? Why?

105
00:10:57,954 --> 00:10:58,756
Don't know.

106
00:11:04,491 --> 00:11:05,665
Nothing!

107
00:11:13,061 --> 00:11:14,236
That light...

108
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:24,952
It must be Mr. Furuichi. He's
leading someone else over here.

109
00:11:35,036 --> 00:11:36,323
Aftershock.

110
00:11:43,541 --> 00:11:47,667
Keep calm, please! If you're near a window, move back!

111
00:12:00,329 --> 00:12:03,040
There has just been another major aftershock.

112
00:12:03,421 --> 00:12:06,290
Beware of fires, crumbling
buildings, and any falling objects.

113
00:12:06,315 --> 00:12:08,768
God, how long is this gonna go on?

114
00:12:09,173 --> 00:12:10,756
It's just annoying now.

115
00:12:13,105 --> 00:12:14,449
Was anyone injured?

116
00:12:15,721 --> 00:12:20,159
The window glass is cracked! Please,
keep away from the school building!

117
00:12:20,317 --> 00:12:22,849
I can't take this anymore!

118
00:12:22,874 --> 00:12:25,244
We're okay! It's safe now!

119
00:12:25,643 --> 00:12:26,913
Big one, huh?

120
00:12:27,771 --> 00:12:28,416
Yeah.

121
00:12:30,723 --> 00:12:34,042
You two are so great. You're really holding up.

122
00:12:34,812 --> 00:12:37,720
No matter what, we keep our promise to each other.

123
00:12:38,454 --> 00:12:40,587
We won't get separated, okay?

124
00:12:47,486 --> 00:12:49,670
Is there anybody here whose hurt?

125
00:12:51,632 --> 00:12:55,427
It's seems Mr. Furuichi must be a local volunteer.

126
00:13:00,947 --> 00:13:02,293
We need to thank him.

127
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:05,422
Ah, so here you are.

128
00:13:08,312 --> 00:13:11,427
Thank you so much for taking care of the children.

129
00:13:12,573 --> 00:13:14,584
Oh... It's nothing.

130
00:13:14,917 --> 00:13:16,130
You're not hurt?

131
00:13:16,971 --> 00:13:18,481
Uh..no, ma'am.

132
00:13:18,643 --> 00:13:21,823
It must have been frightening, but we're safe now.

133
00:13:22,498 --> 00:13:25,224
Your daddy and mommy will come for you soon.

134
00:13:27,894 --> 00:13:31,294
I know. Why don't I give you some candy?

135
00:13:31,614 --> 00:13:35,361
Grandma bought it for you. I know how much you like sweets.

136
00:13:35,809 --> 00:13:36,488
Here.

137
00:13:39,636 --> 00:13:41,406
Th-Thank you very much.

138
00:13:42,832 --> 00:13:43,940
Here you go.

139
00:13:43,965 --> 00:13:44,997
Thank you!

140
00:13:45,092 --> 00:13:47,649
You like those candies, don't you?

141
00:13:49,848 --> 00:13:50,711
Misako!

142
00:13:52,070 --> 00:13:53,299
Hello, Dear.

143
00:13:53,329 --> 00:13:57,286
I want you to stay in the auditorium. It's safe in there.

144
00:13:58,108 --> 00:13:59,600
She's your wife?

145
00:14:01,369 --> 00:14:03,825
She wasn't bothering you, was she?

146
00:14:04,668 --> 00:14:06,416
No, not at all.

147
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:08,760
She gave me some yummy candy!

148
00:14:09,987 --> 00:14:14,640
Well, good for you. Enjoy it, please. Shall we go, Dear?

149
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:17,312
But Dear, the children...

150
00:14:17,337 --> 00:14:20,160
It's all right. They'll be safe here.

151
00:14:20,804 --> 00:14:21,789
Come along.

152
00:14:34,171 --> 00:14:35,917
That old lady, she..

153
00:14:50,246 --> 00:14:51,102
Another one!

154
00:14:51,613 --> 00:14:52,761
Stay close.

155
00:14:54,662 --> 00:14:56,027
No! No!

156
00:15:00,466 --> 00:15:02,699
It's okay! It won't reach us here.

157
00:15:03,488 --> 00:15:05,547
Chii! Koh!

158
00:15:07,287 --> 00:15:08,485
I'm coming!

159
00:15:10,289 --> 00:15:11,432
Misako!

160
00:15:12,527 --> 00:15:13,202
Dear...

161
00:15:13,503 --> 00:15:15,138
You don't have to go.

162
00:15:15,219 --> 00:15:16,963
But what about the children...!

163
00:15:16,988 --> 00:15:18,080
That's enough.

164
00:15:26,846 --> 00:15:27,666
Chii!

165
00:15:27,691 --> 00:15:30,513
Misako. Stop this, now.

166
00:15:30,692 --> 00:15:31,926
Mr. Furuichi!

167
00:15:32,358 --> 00:15:34,997
Oh, thank you. Are you all right?

168
00:15:35,107 --> 00:15:36,854
Yes. Are you hurt?

169
00:15:37,422 --> 00:15:41,706
We're fine. Now, come along, Misako.

170
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:51,171
Hey... That old lady keeps calling us Chii and Koh.

171
00:15:51,223 --> 00:15:52,639
I wonder why?

172
00:15:53,239 --> 00:15:53,816
Uh..

173
00:15:55,026 --> 00:15:59,501
Maybe... I think she's mistaken the
two of you for her own grandchildren.

174
00:16:09,784 --> 00:16:13,592
Mr. Furuichi's grandchildren
were killed in the quake yesterday.

175
00:16:18,649 --> 00:16:22,211
They apparently came for a
surprise visit from the country...

176
00:16:30,831 --> 00:16:33,739
Chii... Koh...

177
00:16:36,551 --> 00:16:39,030
It must be so hard for him

178
00:16:40,065 --> 00:16:43,162
but he's been all over, helping out here and there.

179
00:16:44,255 --> 00:16:45,896
He's an inspiration.

180
00:16:48,613 --> 00:16:53,952
If you need water or blankets, please come
on over to the tents on the athletic field.

181
00:16:54,586 --> 00:16:57,010
We've been gathering them from here and there.

182
00:16:57,035 --> 00:16:58,728
Thank you very much.

183
00:17:00,009 --> 00:17:00,922
Oh, yes!

184
00:17:01,668 --> 00:17:03,806
Have you had any thing to eat yet?

185
00:17:04,043 --> 00:17:07,503
We'll be having curry udon on the athletic field, soon.

186
00:17:35,469 --> 00:17:36,340
Ah!

187
00:17:41,291 --> 00:17:45,514
Despite all the terrible things that
happened to everyone in this quake...

188
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:49,606
I'm thankful. I truly am.

189
00:18:13,284 --> 00:18:14,734
What's wrong? Can't move?

190
00:18:14,759 --> 00:18:15,930
Not a bit.

191
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:20,956
Me, neither. There's something...

192
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:36,569
You must be thirsty. How about some water?

193
00:18:36,704 --> 00:18:39,672
Thank you. I'd love some, Mr. Furuichi.

194
00:18:40,346 --> 00:18:44,633
You really are a life saver. Despite
all that's happened to everyone...

195
00:18:44,936 --> 00:18:48,480
No, no. This is all that I can do.

196
00:18:54,848 --> 00:18:55,869
What's wrong?

197
00:18:56,752 --> 00:18:58,141
But, mister...

198
00:18:58,854 --> 00:19:02,582
After what happened to you grand-kid..

199
00:19:04,734 --> 00:19:05,887
You heard, then?

200
00:19:07,837 --> 00:19:08,744
Yes..

201
00:19:12,582 --> 00:19:15,540
They were my daughter's kids, from Okayama.

202
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:20,066
I hear they barely got any
tremors in that part of the country.

203
00:19:21,174 --> 00:19:25,564
I'd just asked them to come visit.
That's the most tragic part of it.

204
00:19:27,775 --> 00:19:32,323
They were actually just little
older than you and your brother now.

205
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:36,359
But to my wife, they'll always be little kids.

206
00:19:39,215 --> 00:19:41,081
I'm glad you're all okay.

207
00:19:41,106 --> 00:19:42,630
That's really good.

208
00:19:48,861 --> 00:19:51,491
It should have been me who died.

209
00:19:53,988 --> 00:19:58,067
I'd rather the young ones who live.

210
00:20:19,095 --> 00:20:22,012
He's amazing. Mr. Furuichi...

211
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:29,704
Makes me think I wasn't able to do anything for Megu.

212
00:20:36,589 --> 00:20:37,337
Come here.

213
00:20:43,791 --> 00:20:48,375
There are things to do at times like these, right..

214
00:20:51,529 --> 00:20:52,328
Uh-huh.

215
00:22:21,488 --> 00:22:25,388
Communications still out. Families concerned for members.
