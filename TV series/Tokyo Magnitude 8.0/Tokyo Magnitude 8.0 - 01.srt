1
00:01:37,315 --> 00:01:39,124
I hate it when they scold me.

2
00:01:39,832 --> 00:01:43,015
And I hate being yelled at
in my spare time even more.

3
00:01:43,382 --> 00:01:44,399
I've had it.

4
00:01:45,092 --> 00:01:47,657
Everything could just fall apart, for all I care.

5
00:01:48,336 --> 00:01:51,479
Day after day, that was what I thought...

6
00:01:52,425 --> 00:01:55,903
As we have already reported, today at 3:45 PM,

7
00:01:55,928 --> 00:01:59,154
a massive earthquake occurred,
centered in the Kanto region.

8
00:01:59,266 --> 00:02:05,755
The quake's epicenter was in the northern area of
Tokyo Bay, at a depth of approximately 25 kilometers.

9
00:02:05,802 --> 00:02:09,793
The scale of the earthquake
is estimated at magnitude 8.0.

10
00:02:10,312 --> 00:02:13,858
Please beware of aftershocks and possible tsunamis.

11
00:02:13,908 --> 00:02:14,647
ODAIBA SINKS

12
00:02:14,672 --> 00:02:17,301
Onozawa? Mirai Onozawa?

13
00:02:17,592 --> 00:02:18,313
Yes.

14
00:02:22,488 --> 00:02:24,376
Okay, next. Kato?

15
00:02:24,401 --> 00:02:24,830
Yes.

16
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:26,052
Hiroko Kato.

17
00:02:28,138 --> 00:02:30,199
Kubo? Mayumi Kubo.

18
00:02:30,224 --> 00:02:30,772
Yes!

19
00:02:31,972 --> 00:02:33,491
So, what are your grades?

20
00:02:33,516 --> 00:02:35,913
I'm sunk. You, Mayu?

21
00:02:35,954 --> 00:02:36,863
In the same boat.

22
00:02:36,888 --> 00:02:39,650
Me, too. There's no way I can
show this to my parents.

23
00:02:39,689 --> 00:02:43,259
They're so strict, I can guess my summer
vacation goodbye.

24
00:02:44,187 --> 00:02:48,045
Lighten up, Yuka! There's no parent
who doesn't love their kids.

25
00:02:48,125 --> 00:02:49,776
Have you met mine?

26
00:02:50,897 --> 00:02:53,201
Wow, you're going to the Caribbean?

27
00:02:53,226 --> 00:02:55,506
Yeah, they said they're taking it easy this year.

28
00:02:55,769 --> 00:02:57,531
Where's your vacation house, Risa?

29
00:02:57,782 --> 00:03:00,533
Canada. Daddy built a log house there.

30
00:03:00,663 --> 00:03:03,519
Wow. Hey, why don't you come over tonight?

31
00:03:03,664 --> 00:03:05,666
Mom's going to be baking us a soufflé.

32
00:03:05,708 --> 00:03:07,084
Sure, I'll come.

33
00:03:07,307 --> 00:03:10,246
Megu, you're so
lucky you live close to school.

34
00:03:11,432 --> 00:03:14,213
So, where are you going for
summer vacation, Onozawa?

35
00:03:14,713 --> 00:03:17,454
Oh, we don't have any plans like that.

36
00:03:17,978 --> 00:03:21,163
I see. Well, you should go some place cool, then.

37
00:03:21,649 --> 00:03:23,632
This year looks like it's gonna be a real scorcher.

38
00:03:23,657 --> 00:03:24,149
Yeah...

39
00:03:26,226 --> 00:03:28,548
Okay, as for your homework
over summer break

40
00:03:28,752 --> 00:03:30,881
I was thinking I'd like a "future report,"

41
00:03:31,207 --> 00:03:33,697
where you imagine yourself ten years from now.

42
00:03:33,977 --> 00:03:37,364
Please, use your vacation time to
really think about that, okay?

43
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:40,010
Okay.

44
00:03:45,038 --> 00:03:46,845
So, what are you gonna write about?

45
00:03:47,239 --> 00:03:48,844
For my future report?

46
00:03:48,869 --> 00:03:50,266
I have no idea.

47
00:03:50,307 --> 00:03:53,079
You'll be a pianist, Yuka, so you're all set.

48
00:03:53,327 --> 00:03:56,264
I like playing the piano,
but that's not an easy life.

49
00:03:57,441 --> 00:04:00,891
Still, it may be nice, as long as
you're doing something you like.

50
00:04:00,916 --> 00:04:01,670
I'll say.

51
00:04:02,205 --> 00:04:04,866
But I don't even know what
I like or what I want to do.

52
00:04:04,891 --> 00:04:05,864
Me, neither.

53
00:04:06,001 --> 00:04:08,143
Hey, wanna head over to Shibuya?

54
00:04:08,198 --> 00:04:09,223
Good idea!

55
00:04:10,101 --> 00:04:11,725
Mirai, you come, too!

56
00:04:11,752 --> 00:04:14,760
I can't. My parents are working today.

57
00:04:14,999 --> 00:04:16,549
I have to watch the house.

58
00:04:31,193 --> 00:04:33,459
Tomorrow's summer break.

59
00:04:34,497 --> 00:04:37,081
Well, it's not like I'll be having much fun.

60
00:04:37,805 --> 00:04:40,257
There's nothing I especially want to do.

61
00:04:43,379 --> 00:04:46,239
I need to trim these bangs.
Getting annoying.

62
00:05:00,585 --> 00:05:03,712
I don't really have any
special dreams for the future.

63
00:05:04,076 --> 00:05:08,182
All I'm sure of is I don't wanna
grow up to be like THAT.

64
00:05:08,797 --> 00:05:11,288
That won't be me in 10 years, will it?

65
00:05:27,614 --> 00:05:28,544
Yuuki.

66
00:05:29,757 --> 00:05:32,016
Like that, see? Oh!

67
00:05:32,381 --> 00:05:33,741
Hi, there. Sis!

68
00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:35,137
The Cell Phonian!

69
00:05:35,162 --> 00:05:35,626
Wham'?!

70
00:05:36,434 --> 00:05:39,297
I've never seen anyone from
planet Cell Phone before!

71
00:05:39,322 --> 00:05:40,614
They anger easily.

72
00:05:40,823 --> 00:05:42,752
What have you been telling him?!

73
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:46,590
Onozawa. So, how's middle school?

74
00:05:47,537 --> 00:05:48,934
Nothing special.

75
00:05:49,058 --> 00:05:50,822
It has to be better than that.

76
00:05:51,292 --> 00:05:53,541
But it really is nothing special.

77
00:05:54,842 --> 00:05:57,055
What are you guys doing after school?

78
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:59,054
Oh, it's a favor for Yuuki.

79
00:05:59,649 --> 00:06:01,624
The marronnier tree dad got me

80
00:06:01,691 --> 00:06:04,423
won't grow big at home, so I brought it to school.

81
00:06:04,764 --> 00:06:06,723
Teacher said I could plant it over there.

82
00:06:09,438 --> 00:06:11,903
I know! Sis, you help, too!

83
00:06:11,979 --> 00:06:12,980
Huh?!

84
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:14,091
Good idea.

85
00:06:14,116 --> 00:06:14,927
Isn't it?

86
00:06:16,113 --> 00:06:17,120
No way.

87
00:06:17,868 --> 00:06:20,127
Oh, I'm dripping wet!

88
00:06:20,152 --> 00:06:22,774
It's good to work up a sweat once in a while.

89
00:06:23,026 --> 00:06:24,294
Says who.

90
00:06:24,421 --> 00:06:25,923
Now it'll grow big.

91
00:06:26,243 --> 00:06:28,132
Yeah. Thanks, Itsuki.

92
00:06:30,738 --> 00:06:32,753
Let's come and water it during summer break.

93
00:06:32,778 --> 00:06:33,327
Right!

94
00:06:35,091 --> 00:06:36,377
Let's go home, Yuuki.

95
00:06:36,402 --> 00:06:36,990
Yeah!

96
00:06:37,836 --> 00:06:40,284
You said we play soccer after this was planted.

97
00:06:40,337 --> 00:06:41,774
Oh, that's right.

98
00:06:53,643 --> 00:06:54,867
Oh my god.

99
00:06:55,143 --> 00:06:56,668
What is with him?

100
00:07:05,148 --> 00:07:05,998
Mirai?

101
00:07:06,066 --> 00:07:07,609
Oh? You're home.

102
00:07:08,267 --> 00:07:11,804
Say "I'm home" when you walk in!
I thought you were a burglar.

103
00:07:12,791 --> 00:07:14,742
I'm heading out. I've got clients waiting.

104
00:07:15,475 --> 00:07:16,381
There's cake here.

105
00:07:21,742 --> 00:07:23,383
Hyping it up, much?

106
00:07:23,953 --> 00:07:25,457
I have to get going.

107
00:07:25,533 --> 00:07:27,218
Share that cake with Yuuki, okay?

108
00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:28,941
Aren't you having any?

109
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:31,024
Mommy's on a diet, dear.

110
00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:43,458
They're wedges!
You should have gotten a round one!

111
00:07:44,288 --> 00:07:47,184
Oh, and you'd better bring in the laundry,
won't you, Mirai?

112
00:07:47,462 --> 00:07:48,582
It looks like rain.

113
00:07:48,607 --> 00:07:49,473
What's?

114
00:07:49,498 --> 00:07:51,245
Wash your plates after you have your cake.

115
00:07:51,585 --> 00:07:54,423
Then wait for an express package
and groceries from the co-op.

116
00:07:54,501 --> 00:07:57,194
Get the produce in the fridge
as soon as it comes, okay?

117
00:07:57,268 --> 00:07:59,381
Okay, I'll be back sometime around 7:00.

118
00:07:59,541 --> 00:08:00,874
See you later!

119
00:08:02,837 --> 00:08:05,894
And leave your report card out. I'll look at it later.

120
00:08:08,263 --> 00:08:11,716
Like I care, after all that
stuff you told me to do.

121
00:08:20,876 --> 00:08:21,844
What's that?

122
00:08:22,161 --> 00:08:24,218
For Mom. For her birthday.

123
00:08:34,125 --> 00:08:36,823
"To Mom, Happy Birthday."

124
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:43,069
Bor-ing.

125
00:08:43,094 --> 00:08:43,872
Boring?

126
00:08:43,897 --> 00:08:45,922
No, I guess it's okay.

127
00:08:46,642 --> 00:08:48,668
What are you giving her, Sis?

128
00:08:51,203 --> 00:08:52,221
Nothing special.

129
00:08:52,246 --> 00:08:54,485
Well, why don't we both give this to her?

130
00:08:54,777 --> 00:08:57,274
You drew it! YOU give it to her!

131
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,994
There's cake. Want some?

132
00:09:09,928 --> 00:09:11,208
It's good, huh?

133
00:09:11,703 --> 00:09:12,991
Bor-ing.

134
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:16,206
Would it be better if we
could eat with mom, right?

135
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:19,086
But Mommy has to go out!

136
00:09:19,353 --> 00:09:22,610
Share that cake with Yuuki. Mommy's on a diet!

137
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:26,804
You sound just like her! Do it again!

138
00:09:29,001 --> 00:09:30,165
What's wrong?

139
00:09:31,123 --> 00:09:33,439
You're still such a little kid, Yuuki.

140
00:09:36,994 --> 00:09:40,059
Darn it... I wanted to eat a round cake.

141
00:09:40,871 --> 00:09:44,356
How can you not know that birthday
cake is supposed to be round?

142
00:09:46,707 --> 00:09:48,352
Sis! This is awesome!

143
00:09:48,987 --> 00:09:51,591
Wait. I'm super busy right now.

144
00:09:52,307 --> 00:09:54,142
The Cell Phonian appears...

145
00:09:55,948 --> 00:09:56,676
I'm home.

146
00:09:58,569 --> 00:09:59,789
Ah, it's cool in here.

147
00:09:59,789 --> 00:10:00,872
Welcome home.

148
00:10:00,897 --> 00:10:02,432
Hm? Where's your mom?

149
00:10:02,701 --> 00:10:03,601
Not home yet.

150
00:10:03,651 --> 00:10:05,847
Oh. Well, I'll take a shower, then.

151
00:10:06,427 --> 00:10:09,720
Did you remember? Today's Mom's birthday.

152
00:10:09,951 --> 00:10:11,748
Yeah, so it is.

153
00:10:17,767 --> 00:10:19,703
Ah... That feels better.

154
00:10:24,724 --> 00:10:25,868
Hey, hey!

155
00:10:25,893 --> 00:10:28,721
Don't leave things lying around, put those away.

156
00:10:30,736 --> 00:10:33,566
So... Summer break starts tomorrow.

157
00:10:34,122 --> 00:10:37,467
Yeah. You should get your homework
done as soon as you can.

158
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:39,207
That's not what I meant.

159
00:10:39,646 --> 00:10:41,997
Aren't we going somewhere on vacation?

160
00:10:42,429 --> 00:10:46,367
Everyone's always "Exams! Exams!",
we never go anywhere.

161
00:10:46,472 --> 00:10:47,542
Well, that's true...

162
00:10:47,805 --> 00:10:49,599
Why don't we ask your mom about that?

163
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:52,578
No way. She gets mad over nothing all the time.

164
00:10:54,125 --> 00:10:56,399
Because she's busy with work now.

165
00:10:56,818 --> 00:10:58,806
Well, maybe she's due for a vacation.

166
00:11:03,008 --> 00:11:03,938
I'm home.

167
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:08,271
Hi, Mom!

168
00:11:08,827 --> 00:11:09,748
Hello.

169
00:11:10,189 --> 00:11:12,935
Arg! I forgot to buy milk.

170
00:11:13,617 --> 00:11:15,525
Hi, Dear. What about dinner?

171
00:11:15,605 --> 00:11:17,053
Heating it up right now.

172
00:11:17,307 --> 00:11:18,906
It's after 8 o'clock.

173
00:11:19,868 --> 00:11:23,077
It's not like I can help it! I work too, you know!

174
00:11:23,759 --> 00:11:26,569
No, it's just... but the kids are hungry.

175
00:11:26,638 --> 00:11:28,966
So? I said I'm making it now!

176
00:11:29,593 --> 00:11:31,347
Oh, would you cut that out!

177
00:11:31,795 --> 00:11:33,603
Dad, don't blame it on us!

178
00:11:47,984 --> 00:11:49,765
What're you looking so down about?

179
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:52,777
I didn't give her my present.

180
00:11:54,171 --> 00:11:56,843
Why are you always so worried about them.

181
00:11:56,884 --> 00:11:58,439
Even though you're just a kid...

182
00:11:58,885 --> 00:12:01,174
So are you, you know, sis.

183
00:12:01,388 --> 00:12:03,540
Don't you want Mom and Dad to get along?

184
00:12:03,589 --> 00:12:05,121
That would be nice.

185
00:12:06,089 --> 00:12:09,405
At this point, they can do
what they want, for all I care.

186
00:12:20,583 --> 00:12:21,745
What are you up to?

187
00:12:21,964 --> 00:12:23,134
Nothing!

188
00:12:35,633 --> 00:12:38,453
Parents got a look at my future report.

189
00:12:38,544 --> 00:12:42,093
Got surprise lecture about how
I had to go to college first.

190
00:12:42,209 --> 00:12:45,690
Same here. Got lectured about
not missing piano lessons.

191
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:46,602
Sucks.

192
00:12:49,359 --> 00:12:52,011
So, what is this I wanna be?

193
00:12:53,028 --> 00:12:54,847
My name may mean "future",

194
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:57,906
but I have no idea what mine is.

195
00:13:02,749 --> 00:13:04,481
So hot...

196
00:13:04,506 --> 00:13:06,004
Whoops! Morning.

197
00:13:07,714 --> 00:13:08,618
See you.

198
00:13:09,274 --> 00:13:09,959
Bye.

199
00:13:10,454 --> 00:13:12,180
Please, Mom?!

200
00:13:12,214 --> 00:13:14,019
You-Chan, don't be selfish.

201
00:13:14,283 --> 00:13:16,678
I have work to do. It can't be helped.

202
00:13:16,851 --> 00:13:20,068
So, why can't Sis and I go by ourselves?

203
00:13:20,729 --> 00:13:21,999
By yourselves?

204
00:13:24,961 --> 00:13:25,835
Uh, What?

205
00:13:26,531 --> 00:13:28,617
Huh?! A robot exhibit?!

206
00:13:28,964 --> 00:13:30,706
They're holding it over at Odaiba.

207
00:13:30,942 --> 00:13:32,823
Do me a favor and take him, OK?

208
00:13:33,025 --> 00:13:35,790
I don't wanna go see some stupid robots!

209
00:13:36,164 --> 00:13:39,334
Besides, why do I have to
play nursemaid for Yuuki?

210
00:13:39,596 --> 00:13:40,223
I...

211
00:13:40,256 --> 00:13:42,771
What's the big deal? You're on summer break.

212
00:13:42,863 --> 00:13:46,056
You said you wouldn't give up your
precious time for summer classes,

213
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:47,731
so I know you're free!

214
00:13:48,056 --> 00:13:49,336
Alright, Fine!

215
00:13:49,653 --> 00:13:51,959
You want me to take him? I'll take him!

216
00:13:59,764 --> 00:14:01,639
Sis! Look at the bridge!

217
00:14:02,382 --> 00:14:04,600
We came here once before! Look!

218
00:14:04,679 --> 00:14:06,839
All right! OK, Jesus!

219
00:14:26,259 --> 00:14:28,118
Now arriving at Daiba. Daiba.

220
00:14:28,257 --> 00:14:30,391
Oh! Odaiba! We have to get off.

221
00:14:30,416 --> 00:14:32,147
Huh? Oh...

222
00:14:36,276 --> 00:14:38,697
Sis, let's take the bus.

223
00:14:38,733 --> 00:14:42,471
We got off too soon because you
kept going on about Odaiba.

224
00:14:42,616 --> 00:14:43,457
Deal with it!

225
00:14:44,047 --> 00:14:45,004
It's hot.

226
00:14:45,029 --> 00:14:46,012
No, it isn't!

227
00:14:46,088 --> 00:14:47,388
Sure is hot.

228
00:14:54,435 --> 00:14:55,116
Let's go.

229
00:15:07,491 --> 00:15:10,239
This? This is what you wanted to see?

230
00:15:11,593 --> 00:15:12,685
You don't?

231
00:15:16,358 --> 00:15:17,227
OK, fine.

232
00:15:17,423 --> 00:15:18,534
Come on, let's go.

233
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:28,226
Sis, you look! You can pet them!

234
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:32,190
Aw... It's so cute.

235
00:15:32,555 --> 00:15:35,101
Kitty! Paw! Give me your paw!

236
00:15:38,306 --> 00:15:40,890
Hey, they've got ones you can operate over there!

237
00:15:46,407 --> 00:15:50,402
These are quadruped robots,
designed to move by crawling.

238
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:53,502
Their four legs can adjust to uneven terrain,

239
00:15:53,527 --> 00:15:57,099
allowing their operation on the
rough ground of a disaster area.

240
00:15:58,126 --> 00:16:01,399
Its mobility can be used by rescue
teams in their operations

241
00:16:01,496 --> 00:16:03,355
and its radar system can find buried survivors.

242
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:05,775
It's awesome! Sis, you give it a try!

243
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,946
Its on board
electromagnetic search radar

244
00:16:07,971 --> 00:16:12,123
can detect the respiration of an immobilized
person from 5 meters away.

245
00:16:12,148 --> 00:16:16,295
The range can be extended to 8 meters
if they can move even a little bit.

246
00:16:18,892 --> 00:16:19,982
Look at it go!

247
00:16:20,289 --> 00:16:21,185
Hi, sis,

248
00:16:21,417 --> 00:16:22,823
Don't be so rough with it.

249
00:16:22,999 --> 00:16:24,397
It was fine!

250
00:16:24,964 --> 00:16:27,178
Hey, are you going to be there all day?

251
00:16:27,203 --> 00:16:28,450
Could you hurry up?

252
00:16:58,827 --> 00:16:59,879
Thanks a lot.

253
00:17:03,178 --> 00:17:07,377
C'mon, Sis, why don't we
go buy Mom a present for her birthday?

254
00:17:07,942 --> 00:17:10,414
Huh? Never mind about that.

255
00:17:10,588 --> 00:17:15,559
For starters, if she'd just brought you herself,
then I wouldn't have had such a rotten day.

256
00:17:15,871 --> 00:17:18,469
She looks down on me because
she thinks I'm a kid.

257
00:17:18,671 --> 00:17:19,392
But...

258
00:17:19,578 --> 00:17:22,045
For another thing, I don't have any money.

259
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:23,623
I do! I have some.

260
00:17:32,642 --> 00:17:34,426
Which one should we get, Sis?

261
00:17:40,744 --> 00:17:42,546
Hey, how about that one?

262
00:17:48,164 --> 00:17:49,815
That's a popular one.

263
00:17:50,251 --> 00:17:51,991
Oh, you don't say.

264
00:17:53,596 --> 00:17:55,804
It's nice to get something
like this once in a while.

265
00:18:01,239 --> 00:18:03,855
Oh, I'm sorry. Did you want this?

266
00:18:05,529 --> 00:18:06,444
No...

267
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:08,373
Sorry,

268
00:18:09,081 --> 00:18:12,503
Here, take it. It's too flashy
for my grandma, anyway.

269
00:18:12,715 --> 00:18:13,592
That's okay.

270
00:18:13,853 --> 00:18:15,698
Take it, I insist.

271
00:18:16,097 --> 00:18:17,644
Really, it's okay.

272
00:18:19,016 --> 00:18:22,109
How about this one, Sis?
This one's nice, too!

273
00:18:23,026 --> 00:18:24,262
Getting somebody a present?

274
00:18:24,317 --> 00:18:24,883
Yeah.

275
00:18:25,972 --> 00:18:27,616
It's our mom's birthday.

276
00:18:27,730 --> 00:18:29,602
Oh, that's sweet.

277
00:18:29,627 --> 00:18:32,702
I'd definitely cry if my
daughter gave me this as a gift.

278
00:18:33,449 --> 00:18:34,649
Thanks a lot!

279
00:18:35,144 --> 00:18:36,454
Hope your mom likes it.

280
00:18:38,025 --> 00:18:40,877
There's a lot of people today.
Be careful you don't get lost.

281
00:18:40,902 --> 00:18:41,471
Bye!

282
00:18:43,357 --> 00:18:45,175
Don't treat me like a kid.

283
00:18:46,517 --> 00:18:50,466
C'mon, Sis, let's get this one. Mom likes flowers!

284
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:52,569
Buy what you want.

285
00:18:58,540 --> 00:19:00,836
Sis, I gotta go to the toilet.

286
00:19:00,861 --> 00:19:01,813
So, go.

287
00:19:02,178 --> 00:19:04,410
Here, hold this for me.

288
00:19:04,974 --> 00:19:08,812
Oh, after you're done, buy us a drink.
I'll be outside.

289
00:19:08,842 --> 00:19:09,510
Sure!

290
00:19:11,935 --> 00:19:13,443
So hot...

291
00:19:17,718 --> 00:19:21,092
Hey! You mind not stopping in the entrance?

292
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:35,228
Oh, I've had it!

293
00:19:36,072 --> 00:19:39,335
Why is everything trying so hard to piss me off?

294
00:19:46,448 --> 00:19:49,243
Day after day, everything makes me angry.

295
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:53,302
Seriously.

296
00:19:55,817 --> 00:19:57,576
What's with that face?

297
00:20:04,628 --> 00:20:05,602
I wonder..

298
00:20:05,938 --> 00:20:08,813
Is anything good going to happen in my life?

299
00:20:11,904 --> 00:20:14,711
I've had it. It's all such a pain.

300
00:20:15,719 --> 00:20:18,679
The whole world can fall apart, for all I care.

301
00:20:29,279 --> 00:20:30,102
Earthquake?

302
00:20:49,848 --> 00:20:51,668
No way... Ah!

303
00:20:59,518 --> 00:21:00,622
Yuuki.

304
00:21:09,479 --> 00:21:10,615
YUUKI!

305
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:34,769
Magnitude 8.0. Tokyo has been destroyed.
