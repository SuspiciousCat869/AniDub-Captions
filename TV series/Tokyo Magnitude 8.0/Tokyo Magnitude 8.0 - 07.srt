1
00:01:33,554 --> 00:01:34,696
Zero-Four, reaction.

2
00:01:34,721 --> 00:01:36,132
Zero-Two, confirming 2-5-2.

3
00:01:36,157 --> 00:01:37,688
It's dangerous. Please step back.

4
00:01:37,713 --> 00:01:42,624
We are currently using our Robo-Qs and other search
equipment in an all-out effort to locate survivors.

5
00:01:42,649 --> 00:01:44,425
We've already confirmed one survivor.

6
00:01:45,356 --> 00:01:47,644
How long until they can be rescued?

7
00:01:47,669 --> 00:01:53,727
He's buried under multiple sections of reinforced concrete
over 20 cm thick, but it should be any moment now.

8
00:01:53,752 --> 00:01:55,642
We have Team 1 assisting with the rescue.

9
00:01:56,099 --> 00:02:00,610
SUMMER SUNSET

10
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:04,108
Okay, we'll do our best and all get home, okay?

11
00:02:05,731 --> 00:02:07,852
Mari, are you okay now?

12
00:02:08,132 --> 00:02:11,324
Uh-huh! I'm all better now, thanks to you two.

13
00:02:11,832 --> 00:02:13,112
See for yourselves!

14
00:02:13,176 --> 00:02:15,135
Ow! Ow! Ow!

15
00:02:16,462 --> 00:02:17,622
What I tell you?

16
00:02:19,346 --> 00:02:20,309
Jeez...

17
00:02:20,893 --> 00:02:24,637
Now we'll cut through Roppongi and come out in Shibuya.

18
00:02:24,692 --> 00:02:25,446
Right.

19
00:02:31,843 --> 00:02:35,204
I used to pass by here coming
home from school all the time

20
00:02:35,787 --> 00:02:37,754
but it's like a different city now.

21
00:02:42,271 --> 00:02:43,809
Huh? What's that?

22
00:02:45,354 --> 00:02:47,952
Go in once that rebar on top's been pulled off!

23
00:02:47,977 --> 00:02:48,857
Robots..

24
00:02:49,858 --> 00:02:52,584
Okay! Don't skimp on the safety checks!

25
00:02:52,647 --> 00:02:55,014
Okay! Go in from number 2!

26
00:02:55,276 --> 00:02:58,969
Two-five-two, survivor in need
of aid, sighted! He's conscious!

27
00:02:59,651 --> 00:03:00,533
You okay?

28
00:03:00,558 --> 00:03:02,218
Speak to us! You okay?

29
00:03:02,381 --> 00:03:05,157
You all right? Can you tell us your name?

30
00:03:20,521 --> 00:03:22,105
You're drawing robots!

31
00:03:22,773 --> 00:03:24,430
You draw them really good!

32
00:03:26,928 --> 00:03:28,397
You like robots?

33
00:03:28,612 --> 00:03:31,829
Yeah! And I draw them all the time!

34
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:33,893
Do you like drawing pictures, too?

35
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:36,652
Well, not pictures, so much.

36
00:03:36,837 --> 00:03:38,287
I like robots.

37
00:03:38,483 --> 00:03:41,265
I'm taking down lots of notes so I can look them up later.

38
00:03:50,099 --> 00:03:51,477
Hey, you know about those?

39
00:03:52,433 --> 00:03:54,659
It's the first time they're being used in the field.

40
00:03:56,012 --> 00:03:57,997
I saw those at the exhibit!

41
00:03:58,332 --> 00:03:59,370
You, too?

42
00:04:02,277 --> 00:04:04,264
Well, do you know what that one is?

43
00:04:04,784 --> 00:04:05,481
Uh-uh.

44
00:04:08,427 --> 00:04:09,522
Yuuki?

45
00:04:10,138 --> 00:04:11,214
Over there, see?

46
00:04:12,177 --> 00:04:14,679
They trace the arm movements from the control unit.

47
00:04:14,818 --> 00:04:16,401
Each arm can lift one ton.

48
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:20,178
You know a lot about them, huh?

49
00:04:20,203 --> 00:04:20,916
Yeah.

50
00:04:21,439 --> 00:04:25,250
Someday, I want to build robots
just like the ones over there.

51
00:04:34,246 --> 00:04:37,302
What's it doing? Showing off? Since the job is done.

52
00:04:39,495 --> 00:04:41,546
You don't know anything, do you?

53
00:04:42,252 --> 00:04:46,178
It's double-checking to see if there
are any other people who need help here.

54
00:04:52,641 --> 00:04:53,983
It fell over!

55
00:04:54,224 --> 00:04:58,223
Well, it's light weight robot, so
the balance is bad when it walks!

56
00:04:59,688 --> 00:05:02,397
That robot's called a semi-autonomous type.

57
00:05:02,422 --> 00:05:05,325
After you enter the coordinates, it moves on its own.

58
00:05:13,274 --> 00:05:15,058
Well, I've gotta get going now.

59
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:21,113
Thanks a lot, big brother.

60
00:05:21,861 --> 00:05:24,789
My name's Kento. Kento Nonomiya.

61
00:05:25,401 --> 00:05:28,613
My name's Yuuki Onozawa. I'm in the third grade!

62
00:05:28,638 --> 00:05:30,408
Oh? I'm in the seventh grade.

63
00:05:30,794 --> 00:05:33,653
Seventh grade? Just like my big sister!

64
00:05:35,446 --> 00:05:37,335
I hope I'll see you again.

65
00:05:37,383 --> 00:05:38,779
Sure. See you!

66
00:05:43,547 --> 00:05:45,821
That's the type they call an otaku.

67
00:05:46,351 --> 00:05:48,176
A robotaku.

68
00:05:49,985 --> 00:05:55,466
This earthquake is being called the greatest urban
near-field earthquake ever observed in this nation.

69
00:05:55,690 --> 00:06:01,344
According to the government crisis management
center, the death toll is estimated at 180,000

70
00:06:01,926 --> 00:06:07,922
even higher than the 140,000 killed
in the Great Kanto earthquake of 1923.

71
00:06:08,121 --> 00:06:13,850
While the fires around the quake's epicenter are being
extinguished, according to Tokyo Fire Department reports,

72
00:06:14,009 --> 00:06:20,196
150,000 victims may still be threatened,
with 200,000 injured, although that number is...

73
00:06:20,221 --> 00:06:22,079
No word on Sancha, huh?

74
00:06:23,515 --> 00:06:24,431
Mari...

75
00:06:25,362 --> 00:06:27,920
Mm. I'm okay. Thank you.

76
00:06:41,514 --> 00:06:43,014
What? What's wrong?

77
00:06:43,102 --> 00:06:43,895
A rat!

78
00:06:45,153 --> 00:06:46,067
A rat?

79
00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:51,858
Oh. The store...

80
00:06:51,898 --> 00:06:55,567
Yeah. There are lots of rats in this city, so...

81
00:06:57,237 --> 00:06:57,744
What?

82
00:06:57,769 --> 00:06:58,531
Yuuki?!

83
00:06:58,769 --> 00:06:59,634
What's wrong?

84
00:07:01,362 --> 00:07:02,467
I'm OK.

85
00:07:03,002 --> 00:07:05,912
My head was just hurting a little, that's all.

86
00:07:06,954 --> 00:07:09,529
Ow! Your head is burning up!

87
00:07:09,941 --> 00:07:11,799
Maybe it's heatstroke.

88
00:07:16,351 --> 00:07:19,855
Wait in the shade. I'll go see
if there's any medicine I can get.

89
00:07:20,676 --> 00:07:21,442
OK.

90
00:07:27,151 --> 00:07:29,883
Look, tell us if you feel sick, okay?

91
00:07:29,985 --> 00:07:32,639
It'll be a lot of trouble if you start fainting on us.

92
00:07:34,084 --> 00:07:34,925
Sorry.

93
00:07:35,101 --> 00:07:36,102
Jeez...

94
00:07:48,837 --> 00:07:50,527
Oh! It's Kento!

95
00:07:50,552 --> 00:07:52,281
What? Hey! Keep still!

96
00:07:52,416 --> 00:07:55,886
I'm afraid This is all the
municipal services people gave me.

97
00:07:55,911 --> 00:07:57,379
Thanks, it's a real help.

98
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,110
Yuuki!

99
00:07:59,422 --> 00:08:02,489
Mirai? Wait! What are you doing? Where are you going?

100
00:08:02,514 --> 00:08:04,682
Sorry! I'll be right back!

101
00:08:05,694 --> 00:08:06,650
Oh...!

102
00:08:13,512 --> 00:08:15,113
Kento!

103
00:08:15,404 --> 00:08:16,279
Yuuki.

104
00:08:18,935 --> 00:08:22,844
Yuuki! We three promised to stick together, right?

105
00:08:24,438 --> 00:08:25,479
Robotaku.

106
00:08:27,874 --> 00:08:31,304
Sis, we saw those frogbots at the Miraikan, remember?

107
00:08:33,546 --> 00:08:36,657
Frogbots? Yeah, they do look like frogs, don't they?

108
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:39,996
They're waterproof to 20 atmospheres.

109
00:08:40,138 --> 00:08:41,940
Waterproof to 20 atmospheres?

110
00:08:41,965 --> 00:08:45,812
Right. They can withstand the pressure
up to 200 meters below the surface.

111
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:47,830
The question is whether that's necessary or not.

112
00:08:47,855 --> 00:08:48,624
Wow...

113
00:08:49,084 --> 00:08:50,898
Definitely otaku.

114
00:08:50,929 --> 00:08:51,794
Otaku?

115
00:08:52,703 --> 00:08:55,756
I mean... You know all this stuff about robots.

116
00:08:57,947 --> 00:08:59,565
Um. Cause I like them.

117
00:09:00,597 --> 00:09:03,603
If it weren't for robots, my family might have died.

118
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:08,438
That was back when I was in elementary school.

119
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:13,763
I can see the survivors.

120
00:09:13,788 --> 00:09:16,406
Okay, don't use the scope. Proceed carefully.

121
00:09:16,515 --> 00:09:20,848
1 and 2, I need a power cutter and a
spreader right now to get the door open!

122
00:09:20,873 --> 00:09:21,506
Roger!

123
00:09:50,842 --> 00:09:52,718
If that robot hadn't been there,

124
00:09:52,882 --> 00:09:55,250
I don't think they could have saved my whole family.

125
00:09:56,468 --> 00:09:59,944
That's why I want to design
rescue robots like that, some day.

126
00:09:59,969 --> 00:10:01,452
To help someone else.

127
00:10:03,832 --> 00:10:07,255
I'm sorry I called you an otaku before.

128
00:10:08,295 --> 00:10:11,687
That's okay. After all, I do like robots a lot.

129
00:10:12,422 --> 00:10:14,395
Until that robot saved them,

130
00:10:14,531 --> 00:10:17,558
I always thought my parents
and my big sister were annoying.

131
00:10:18,731 --> 00:10:22,129
But, that night, I was really
praying that I wouldn't lose them.

132
00:10:25,568 --> 00:10:26,984
Do you two live around here?

133
00:10:27,929 --> 00:10:30,630
Uh-uh. We live near Kinuta Park.

134
00:10:30,836 --> 00:10:33,992
I see. Well, I hope you get home, soon.

135
00:10:34,176 --> 00:10:34,928
Uh.

136
00:10:35,174 --> 00:10:36,103
Oh, yeah.

137
00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:40,465
For you, Yuuki.

138
00:10:40,914 --> 00:10:41,941
I can have it?!

139
00:10:41,966 --> 00:10:44,015
Sure. I've already memorized it.

140
00:10:45,069 --> 00:10:46,351
Thank you!

141
00:10:50,953 --> 00:10:53,522
How are we going to explain this to Mari?

142
00:10:55,707 --> 00:10:58,531
God! I was really worried about you!

143
00:10:58,602 --> 00:10:59,849
I'm sorry.

144
00:11:00,764 --> 00:11:01,868
How do you feel?

145
00:11:01,893 --> 00:11:05,205
He's fine. You saw how he was running before.

146
00:11:06,431 --> 00:11:07,554
I'm fine.

147
00:11:21,227 --> 00:11:24,063
Yuuki? Are you okay?

148
00:11:25,305 --> 00:11:26,970
Why don't we rest for a while?

149
00:11:29,857 --> 00:11:31,636
A frog baseball team...

150
00:11:32,577 --> 00:11:34,670
What are you talking about, Yuuki?

151
00:11:40,376 --> 00:11:41,806
It really is!

152
00:11:47,592 --> 00:11:48,569
It's raining.

153
00:11:48,924 --> 00:11:49,758
Yeah.

154
00:12:15,885 --> 00:12:17,235
I really appreciate it.

155
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:19,629
No trouble at all. See you in a bit.

156
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:24,391
He said he'd be back in 20 or 30 minutes.

157
00:12:25,092 --> 00:12:27,713
Let's rest a little till then. Why don't we?

158
00:12:35,565 --> 00:12:36,747
Found another one?

159
00:12:38,208 --> 00:12:38,955
Yeah.

160
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:44,825
This place is full of frogs, huh?

161
00:12:45,119 --> 00:12:45,865
Uh.

162
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:48,957
Maybe the owner really likes frogs, like you do.

163
00:12:50,326 --> 00:12:51,363
Sis...

164
00:12:51,458 --> 00:12:52,395
You're finished?

165
00:12:52,578 --> 00:12:53,834
Don't want it.

166
00:12:56,313 --> 00:12:57,794
Are you sure you're okay?

167
00:12:58,362 --> 00:12:59,548
I'm fine.

168
00:12:59,573 --> 00:13:02,321
Maybe he caught a cold from sleeping outside.

169
00:13:04,142 --> 00:13:05,476
Oh, no sis!

170
00:13:06,367 --> 00:13:07,214
Yuuki!

171
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:11,922
Are you okay?!

172
00:13:16,094 --> 00:13:17,131
I'm... I'm fine...

173
00:13:18,022 --> 00:13:19,555
I just ate too much.

174
00:13:24,373 --> 00:13:26,142
Get some sleep, okay?

175
00:13:47,821 --> 00:13:50,120
It's okay. It's okay.

176
00:13:56,007 --> 00:13:56,889
Earthquake?

177
00:13:56,914 --> 00:13:59,096
We're okay. It was just a little one.

178
00:13:59,813 --> 00:14:02,143
Looks like Mari, even slept right through it.

179
00:14:05,786 --> 00:14:09,130
I was dreaming about the robot exhibit.

180
00:14:09,671 --> 00:14:12,107
You really like robots, don't you?

181
00:14:12,428 --> 00:14:15,262
But I think Kento's even more amazing.

182
00:14:15,484 --> 00:14:17,352
'Cuz he's a robotaku?

183
00:14:18,128 --> 00:14:20,019
He is a robot expert.

184
00:14:22,116 --> 00:14:24,526
Kento's the same age as me,

185
00:14:25,488 --> 00:14:28,522
but it's so great that he knows just what he wants to do.

186
00:14:32,717 --> 00:14:33,473
Know what?

187
00:14:33,666 --> 00:14:37,372
Up till now, all I've done is complain about Dad and Mom.

188
00:14:37,397 --> 00:14:37,983
You know,

189
00:14:38,448 --> 00:14:42,400
But they've actually done all
sorts of things for us, haven't they?

190
00:14:42,992 --> 00:14:46,265
All I ever thought about... were the bad things...

191
00:14:46,925 --> 00:14:47,773
And now...

192
00:14:48,977 --> 00:14:52,840
I realize how much I don't want them to die.

193
00:14:54,464 --> 00:14:58,754
When we get home... Let's be a little nicer to them, okay?

194
00:14:59,916 --> 00:15:03,696
Yeah... I hope we can all be nice to each other.

195
00:15:04,296 --> 00:15:05,101
Yeah.

196
00:15:06,433 --> 00:15:08,700
Let's throw Mom another birthday party.

197
00:15:09,312 --> 00:15:13,380
It'll be a surprise party. And we'll buy her a round cake.

198
00:15:13,658 --> 00:15:14,920
Yeah.

199
00:15:17,314 --> 00:15:19,100
Hey, Sis?

200
00:15:19,962 --> 00:15:22,580
The reason I wanted to go to Odaiba...

201
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:26,122
was 'cuz I wanted us to see the bridge together.

202
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:28,882
Yeah. You told me that back in Shiba Park.

203
00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:30,390
I did?

204
00:15:31,684 --> 00:15:34,473
Well, we were arguing, so...

205
00:15:38,111 --> 00:15:41,634
Next time, let's all of us go back to Odaiba.

206
00:15:41,659 --> 00:15:44,821
Sure thing. Except the bridge is gone, now.

207
00:15:45,332 --> 00:15:47,100
They'll build a new one.

208
00:15:52,087 --> 00:15:52,787
Yuuki?

209
00:15:55,402 --> 00:15:57,437
That's my Frogbot 1!

210
00:15:58,444 --> 00:16:00,240
Hey! Wait! Where are you going?

211
00:16:00,265 --> 00:16:01,796
Just to watch the robots!

212
00:16:02,491 --> 00:16:03,137
Uh?

213
00:16:26,038 --> 00:16:27,633
I touched it!

214
00:16:30,772 --> 00:16:33,375
Hey, kid! Don't bother it, okay?

215
00:16:36,758 --> 00:16:39,153
Yuuki, let's go back to Mari.

216
00:16:40,676 --> 00:16:41,344
Right.

217
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:44,341
What?

218
00:16:53,977 --> 00:16:56,966
Yuuki, did you really see Kento there?

219
00:16:57,353 --> 00:16:58,254
Uh.

220
00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:04,998
See? There's nobody here. We can't go in, anyway.

221
00:17:06,083 --> 00:17:07,552
Let's go back, Yuuki.

222
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:08,405
Emm.

223
00:17:10,706 --> 00:17:12,711
Sis! Up there! Look!

224
00:17:19,737 --> 00:17:21,602
What is he doing up here?!

225
00:17:25,077 --> 00:17:26,569
Kento!

226
00:17:26,836 --> 00:17:29,970
What are you doing?! That's dangerous!

227
00:17:29,995 --> 00:17:33,798
The robot's leg is caught in
some debris! Keep away from here!

228
00:17:34,393 --> 00:17:35,260
Huh?!

229
00:17:35,285 --> 00:17:37,921
You're the one who needs to get away from there!

230
00:17:38,053 --> 00:17:40,472
Agh! What's he doing now?!

231
00:17:51,123 --> 00:17:53,246
Yuuki! Go get Mari!

232
00:17:53,401 --> 00:17:54,000
Uh!

233
00:17:55,618 --> 00:17:56,349
Oh...!

234
00:18:03,099 --> 00:18:04,007
Kento!

235
00:18:06,826 --> 00:18:09,054
Stay back! Get an adult!

236
00:18:09,123 --> 00:18:11,522
I already called for one, you dope!

237
00:18:14,489 --> 00:18:16,654
Kento, reach out your hand!

238
00:18:17,689 --> 00:18:18,662
Take this!

239
00:18:18,687 --> 00:18:19,895
Let it go!

240
00:18:21,038 --> 00:18:22,907
Just leave it already!

241
00:18:37,843 --> 00:18:40,743
Thanks! You're pretty strong, aren't you?

242
00:18:43,065 --> 00:18:45,345
Okay, I'll get up top and pull you up.

243
00:18:51,991 --> 00:18:52,623
Here!

244
00:19:02,999 --> 00:19:03,927
Close one, huh?

245
00:19:04,173 --> 00:19:07,605
That was a little more than
close! Whose fault was this any...

246
00:19:11,810 --> 00:19:12,602
You're hurt?!

247
00:19:12,634 --> 00:19:15,717
Are you in danger? Don't move! We'll be right up there!

248
00:19:16,043 --> 00:19:19,402
Concentrate the search on the area
where the scanner signal was strongest!

249
00:19:19,427 --> 00:19:22,174
We use these robots to avoid secondary disasters.

250
00:19:22,199 --> 00:19:25,121
Which is rendered pointless if
you go and get yourselves hurt!

251
00:19:25,395 --> 00:19:26,878
You're both old enough to know better!

252
00:19:27,107 --> 00:19:29,377
Now don't pull a damn fool stunt like this again!

253
00:19:29,496 --> 00:19:30,103
Yes, sir.

254
00:19:30,128 --> 00:19:30,793
Yes, sir.

255
00:19:31,963 --> 00:19:33,734
Personnel or equipment, any problems?

256
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:34,742
No, sir!

257
00:19:34,965 --> 00:19:36,226
Okay, next one!

258
00:19:36,251 --> 00:19:36,720
Captain..

259
00:19:36,745 --> 00:19:37,609
Mirai...

260
00:19:38,658 --> 00:19:40,963
I'm sorry for putting you in danger like that.

261
00:19:42,007 --> 00:19:45,531
And... For saving me... Thank you.

262
00:19:46,550 --> 00:19:48,614
That's okay. It was nothing...

263
00:19:48,997 --> 00:19:50,878
'Cuz Sis is brave, huh?

264
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:54,129
There was nothing brave about this, for heaven's sake!

265
00:19:54,154 --> 00:19:56,449
What did you plan to do if things went wrong?!

266
00:19:57,224 --> 00:19:57,949
I'm sorry.

267
00:19:58,689 --> 00:20:02,178
Kento, please tell me more about robots next time.

268
00:20:02,338 --> 00:20:02,908
Uh.

269
00:20:03,523 --> 00:20:06,222
I'll see you again, I promise.

270
00:20:11,788 --> 00:20:13,476
Okay, shall we go?

271
00:20:13,501 --> 00:20:14,056
Uh!

272
00:20:15,175 --> 00:20:15,881
What?

273
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:18,711
I was thinking how cool you were, Sis!

274
00:20:19,318 --> 00:20:23,375
Next time there's a robot exhibition
in Tokyo, let's all go together!

275
00:20:23,795 --> 00:20:25,398
Dad and Mom and you.

276
00:20:25,591 --> 00:20:26,900
And Kento, too!

277
00:20:28,346 --> 00:20:28,706
Uh.

278
00:20:28,902 --> 00:20:31,476
Mirai! Hey, Yuuki!

279
00:20:32,734 --> 00:20:33,576
Shall we go?

280
00:20:33,977 --> 00:20:34,647
Uh!

281
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:49,244
Yuuki!

282
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:52,494
Yuuki! Yuuki!

283
00:20:53,081 --> 00:20:56,147
What's wrong?! Answer me! Yuuki!

284
00:20:57,201 --> 00:20:58,047
Yuuki!

285
00:22:21,542 --> 00:22:25,880
Number of injured now exceeds the
Great Kanto Earthquake, still climbing.
