1
00:01:42,984 --> 00:01:44,252
What are you looking at?

2
00:01:44,347 --> 00:01:47,824
That machine's so cool! Look at how much it can lift!

3
00:01:48,779 --> 00:01:49,794
Oh, yeah.

4
00:01:50,049 --> 00:01:53,243
Why don't you become a robotaku like Kento and me, Sis?

5
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:54,823
It'll be fun.

6
00:01:55,666 --> 00:01:56,887
I'll think about It.

7
00:01:57,182 --> 00:01:58,077
What is it?

8
00:01:58,836 --> 00:02:02,951
Oh, nothing. Just thinking about how amazing robots are.

9
00:02:03,836 --> 00:02:07,523
Bit by bit, they're bringing
things back to normal. Aren't they.

10
00:02:13,895 --> 00:02:18,162
FAREWELL FOR TODAY

11
00:02:32,502 --> 00:02:33,819
It's all black.

12
00:02:34,554 --> 00:02:35,311
Yeah.

13
00:02:46,154 --> 00:02:49,279
Looks like Naka-Meguro got hit pretty bad, too.

14
00:02:50,076 --> 00:02:54,184
Hey, Sis? Is Mari's house in this neighborhood?

15
00:02:55,831 --> 00:02:59,537
Mari, how much further is it to Sangenjaya?

16
00:03:00,929 --> 00:03:03,731
Let's see... Maybe three kilometers?

17
00:03:03,898 --> 00:03:06,063
I think we should reach it in about an hour.

18
00:03:07,193 --> 00:03:08,655
Let me check it in the news.

19
00:03:09,448 --> 00:03:11,564
And we have reports that the fires that

20
00:03:11,589 --> 00:03:15,445
devastated the area around
Sangenjaya station in Setagaya ward

21
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:18,262
are more or less extinguished across the whole area.

22
00:03:18,642 --> 00:03:22,794
Amidst the anxiety caused by successive
aftershocks and secondary disasters,

23
00:03:23,421 --> 00:03:27,583
fire brigades and self-defense
personnel risk their lives as they continue

24
00:03:27,696 --> 00:03:30,166
search and rescue efforts in the heart of the area.

25
00:03:30,508 --> 00:03:31,438
Meanwhile...

26
00:03:31,463 --> 00:03:34,068
Looks like the fires are out in Sancha, but...

27
00:03:36,013 --> 00:03:38,154
Let's keep moving on as fast as we can.

28
00:03:38,351 --> 00:03:40,757
Quicker to just go there than to worry about it.

29
00:03:42,106 --> 00:03:44,331
I'm sorry to make you hurry like this.

30
00:04:05,616 --> 00:04:06,195
Come on!

31
00:04:06,847 --> 00:04:07,655
R-Right!

32
00:05:05,614 --> 00:05:08,387
Hey! Please, take them back to where you found them.

33
00:05:08,412 --> 00:05:09,031
Why?

34
00:05:09,755 --> 00:05:12,702
Because we have to confirm the identity of these remains.

35
00:05:13,562 --> 00:05:17,362
Screw you! I'm supposed to leave
my daughter in a place like this?!

36
00:05:17,387 --> 00:05:19,596
Think a little before you say stuff like that!

37
00:05:22,706 --> 00:05:26,581
How is this...?! This isn't
what they said on the news at all!

38
00:05:56,668 --> 00:05:57,408
No!

39
00:06:07,306 --> 00:06:08,028
No.

40
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:11,411
Where's Hina? Hina! Mother!

41
00:06:19,657 --> 00:06:20,977
Mari!

42
00:06:21,843 --> 00:06:22,791
Mrs. Yamaji!

43
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:28,036
It was awful. My grandfather
didn't make it out in time, either.

44
00:06:28,569 --> 00:06:31,602
"Either?" You mean Hina and my mother were...?!

45
00:06:31,717 --> 00:06:34,031
This whole area was an inferno.

46
00:06:34,463 --> 00:06:36,899
It was no where to get out once the fire started.

47
00:06:37,278 --> 00:06:41,477
There were so many old houses here
that people were just buried alive.

48
00:06:50,128 --> 00:06:53,264
Excuse me. What happened to the people living here?

49
00:06:53,289 --> 00:06:55,207
Oh, around here...

50
00:06:55,367 --> 00:07:00,084
Well, with so many gas stations
exploding, I hear they all got blown up.

51
00:07:01,652 --> 00:07:04,096
I went out to work my part-time job.

52
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:06,711
I left grandpa all alone...

53
00:07:33,716 --> 00:07:36,606
What do we do? This is our fault.

54
00:07:38,995 --> 00:07:42,375
Mari could have gotten home sooner if it wasn't for us.

55
00:07:47,468 --> 00:07:49,623
C'mon, let's look around a little more.

56
00:07:49,654 --> 00:07:51,607
For Hina and her grandma.

57
00:07:53,006 --> 00:07:55,391
Okay, Sis? Please?

58
00:08:08,627 --> 00:08:09,730
Excuse me!

59
00:08:10,767 --> 00:08:14,879
Pardon me, have you seen the people
who lived in the Kusakabe house?

60
00:08:16,046 --> 00:08:19,026
Can't help you. We're actually from the countryside.

61
00:08:19,307 --> 00:08:23,904
But the folks around here seem to have
evacuated to Kamiuma elementary school.

62
00:08:25,589 --> 00:08:29,068
The word is a lot of people got caught
in the fire that started around here.

63
00:08:29,615 --> 00:08:32,866
They set the school up as a morgue, so
that may be the place to check for now.

64
00:08:33,025 --> 00:08:35,273
It's a terrible thing but that's where they look them.

65
00:08:38,899 --> 00:08:40,323
Let's go see.

66
00:08:40,708 --> 00:08:41,497
But we..

67
00:08:41,894 --> 00:08:43,616
Please, Sis, please!

68
00:08:46,774 --> 00:08:47,214
Emm.

69
00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:57,416
Mari, listen...

70
00:09:00,384 --> 00:09:05,900
A volunteer told me the people around
here evacuated to Kamiuma elementary school.

71
00:09:07,098 --> 00:09:11,842
And also... that they've set up a morgue there.

72
00:09:14,673 --> 00:09:15,300
I see.

73
00:09:45,729 --> 00:09:46,602
Excuse me.

74
00:09:46,828 --> 00:09:50,271
I'm looking for Kusakabe, from Kamiuma, block 2.

75
00:09:50,771 --> 00:09:53,315
A four-year-old girl and an older woman.

76
00:09:54,589 --> 00:09:56,319
Kamiuma, block 2, huh?

77
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:11,223
Kamiuma, block 2. We have an unidentified
woman in her 50's and a four-year-old girl.

78
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:13,438
Are you part of their family?

79
00:10:49,844 --> 00:10:52,273
No... It can't be...

80
00:10:54,645 --> 00:10:55,326
Hina...

81
00:11:22,059 --> 00:11:23,125
That's her there.

82
00:11:24,381 --> 00:11:26,383
You're with the family, young lady?

83
00:11:27,101 --> 00:11:30,935
If you don't mind, would you
please confirm their identities?

84
00:12:03,743 --> 00:12:05,232
I'm sorry, Hina.

85
00:12:06,949 --> 00:12:09,907
Mommy should have been there for you.

86
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:17,110
Well, if you can confirm that
it's them, please let us know.

87
00:12:30,313 --> 00:12:31,384
Sis.

88
00:12:32,644 --> 00:12:35,806
I think Hina and her grandma are still alive.

89
00:12:37,605 --> 00:12:39,659
Don't be ridiculous, Yuuki

90
00:12:40,048 --> 00:12:43,393
I still think we should look some more before we give up.

91
00:12:43,982 --> 00:12:45,361
Please, Sis?

92
00:12:49,826 --> 00:12:53,422
We just got here. There's other places to check, right?

93
00:12:53,624 --> 00:12:56,810
Besides, the gas station near them didn't burn down.

94
00:12:57,049 --> 00:12:58,868
They must still be alive!

95
00:13:00,069 --> 00:13:00,527
Emm

96
00:13:02,428 --> 00:13:03,405
C'mon!

97
00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:04,467
Yuuki, wait!

98
00:13:07,831 --> 00:13:08,863
Hina!

99
00:13:10,679 --> 00:13:12,652
Hina Kusakabe!

100
00:13:14,650 --> 00:13:16,663
Mrs. Kusakabe!

101
00:13:20,367 --> 00:13:21,624
Hina!

102
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:23,743
Hina!

103
00:13:24,715 --> 00:13:26,825
Hina Kusakabe!

104
00:13:27,177 --> 00:13:29,199
Mrs. Kusakabe!

105
00:13:29,397 --> 00:13:30,425
Hina!

106
00:13:30,934 --> 00:13:32,035
Hina!

107
00:13:36,824 --> 00:13:37,746
Not here.

108
00:13:38,151 --> 00:13:40,214
Maybe there's somewhere else to look.

109
00:13:42,384 --> 00:13:43,152
Come on!

110
00:13:47,682 --> 00:13:51,613
Excuse me. I'm sorry, but is this the only shelter?

111
00:13:52,089 --> 00:13:55,403
Oh, no. There's also the kindergarten next door.

112
00:13:55,449 --> 00:13:58,463
Take a right out the main gate and it's a short walk.

113
00:13:59,916 --> 00:14:01,354
Thank you very much.

114
00:14:09,601 --> 00:14:13,117
Okay, everyone, settle down. We're going to read a story.

115
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,143
Hina!

116
00:14:15,529 --> 00:14:17,710
Hina Kusakabe!

117
00:14:24,015 --> 00:14:25,313
Not here.

118
00:14:25,887 --> 00:14:30,479
Excuse me! She's here! Hina! She is here!

119
00:14:36,718 --> 00:14:38,020
Mari!

120
00:14:43,173 --> 00:14:44,376
Over here!

121
00:14:51,587 --> 00:14:52,742
Hina, look.

122
00:14:57,899 --> 00:14:58,783
Hina!

123
00:14:58,808 --> 00:14:59,589
Mommy!

124
00:15:03,295 --> 00:15:04,041
Hina!

125
00:15:04,504 --> 00:15:05,485
Mommy!

126
00:15:07,664 --> 00:15:09,066
Mommy!

127
00:15:14,058 --> 00:15:17,404
Hina, I'm so sorry, I'm sorry.

128
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:24,331
Hina... You're not hurt anywhere?

129
00:15:24,442 --> 00:15:25,362
Uh-uh.

130
00:15:25,545 --> 00:15:26,711
Where's Grandma?

131
00:15:31,482 --> 00:15:32,164
Hina?

132
00:15:32,189 --> 00:15:33,196
Excuse me.

133
00:15:33,477 --> 00:15:35,779
About Hina's grandmother... Well..

134
00:15:35,882 --> 00:15:37,157
She was at the shelter,

135
00:15:37,182 --> 00:15:40,110
but she said she was going home and she never came back.

136
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:43,694
Why not?

137
00:15:51,066 --> 00:15:52,344
Pardon! Excuse me!

138
00:15:52,447 --> 00:15:52,995
Yes?

139
00:15:53,255 --> 00:15:56,111
Is there a Reiko Kusakabe in this hospital?

140
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:04,415
That doctor today was a real hunk, wasn't he?

141
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:05,701
Mother!

142
00:16:08,595 --> 00:16:10,431
Mari! You're all right!

143
00:16:10,517 --> 00:16:11,502
Grandma!

144
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:13,542
Forgive me, Hina.

145
00:16:13,988 --> 00:16:14,986
Mother...!

146
00:16:16,912 --> 00:16:18,597
You hardly got a scratch.

147
00:16:18,764 --> 00:16:21,347
Thank goodness. Oh, thank goodness!

148
00:16:21,372 --> 00:16:24,080
I'm sorry if I worried you. I really didn't mean to.

149
00:16:24,146 --> 00:16:27,663
As you should be! What were you
thinking, going back to the house?!

150
00:16:27,764 --> 00:16:30,867
Well, that's where your and Hina's clothes are, right?

151
00:16:31,306 --> 00:16:34,653
It's been so hot, and I couldn't
stand seeing her get a heat rash.

152
00:16:34,678 --> 00:16:38,371
Oh, for...! In the middle of all
this, you worry about a heat rash?

153
00:16:38,396 --> 00:16:39,610
Well, you know...

154
00:16:40,055 --> 00:16:43,368
Oh, that reminds me. Look. That bundle, there.

155
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:59,805
Those are important things. I had to get them back.

156
00:17:05,471 --> 00:17:06,995
Let's wait around the corner.

157
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:15,204
Nice ending, huh? For Mari.

158
00:17:16,117 --> 00:17:16,831
Uh.

159
00:17:17,529 --> 00:17:19,160
Stretcher, coming through!

160
00:17:37,187 --> 00:17:38,960
Be my mother's nurse?

161
00:17:39,603 --> 00:17:45,772
Yes. In this situation, if we don't ask
relatives to do it, we wouldn't have enough nurses.

162
00:17:46,842 --> 00:17:48,547
If you could, please.

163
00:17:59,157 --> 00:18:00,299
Sis?

164
00:18:03,697 --> 00:18:05,693
Hey sis, listen...

165
00:18:05,718 --> 00:18:06,464
Let's go!

166
00:18:08,044 --> 00:18:10,199
You want to get home soon, too, don't you?

167
00:18:14,409 --> 00:18:18,530
Mari, it's time for us to go home now.

168
00:18:20,519 --> 00:18:24,118
Yuuki told me he really misses Dad and Mom.

169
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:25,252
Wait!

170
00:18:25,418 --> 00:18:28,725
I promised I'd see you home. Just wait a little.

171
00:18:28,852 --> 00:18:30,155
Ms. Kusakabe?

172
00:18:30,489 --> 00:18:34,399
Ms. Kusakabe, I'd like to change your mother's
bandages, would you give me a hand, please?

173
00:18:34,622 --> 00:18:36,247
Right! Coming!

174
00:18:36,998 --> 00:18:39,229
Wait here. I'll be right back.

175
00:18:48,486 --> 00:18:50,406
I told Mari we're going.

176
00:18:50,605 --> 00:18:51,287
Uh.

177
00:18:51,762 --> 00:18:54,665
Once things settle down, we'll see her again.

178
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:55,380
Uh.

179
00:18:57,298 --> 00:18:57,979
Com'on.

180
00:19:03,161 --> 00:19:06,391
So, we're to deliver the
patients to Seijou Academy, right?

181
00:19:06,495 --> 00:19:07,370
Please.

182
00:19:13,888 --> 00:19:15,878
Excuse! Pardon me!

183
00:19:16,617 --> 00:19:20,112
I live near Seijou Academy. Could you give me a lift?

184
00:19:21,296 --> 00:19:24,350
This truck is for transporting casualties, so...

185
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:29,546
Your leg's hurt, isn't it?

186
00:19:30,872 --> 00:19:31,546
Yes!

187
00:19:32,485 --> 00:19:34,385
Then get in. We're about to leave.

188
00:19:34,410 --> 00:19:38,234
Um... Sorry, but can you wait
just a minute? I'll be right back.

189
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:39,800
Sure.

190
00:19:43,731 --> 00:19:44,672
Mommy.

191
00:19:45,927 --> 00:19:48,446
That girl told me to give this to you.

192
00:19:53,033 --> 00:19:57,088
Dear Mari, thank you so much for all you've done.

193
00:19:57,757 --> 00:20:01,443
I don't think we would have gotten
this far if it hadn't been for you.

194
00:20:04,323 --> 00:20:07,264
I'm really glad Hina and your mom are all right.

195
00:20:08,613 --> 00:20:11,372
I got a ride on a truck headed for Seijou.

196
00:20:14,479 --> 00:20:17,005
Forgive me for leaving without telling you.

197
00:20:17,277 --> 00:20:19,900
But I promise, once things have settled down,

198
00:20:20,003 --> 00:20:22,275
Yuuki and I will come visit you together.

199
00:20:23,476 --> 00:20:25,627
I'll never forget you, Mari.

200
00:20:32,544 --> 00:20:33,770
Oh, Mirai...

201
00:20:35,743 --> 00:20:36,845
"Together"?

202
00:20:40,454 --> 00:20:42,050
Do you need to throw up?

203
00:20:42,495 --> 00:20:43,602
Uh-uh.

204
00:20:43,627 --> 00:20:46,045
What's wrong? Are you sick or something?

205
00:20:49,618 --> 00:20:50,448
Then what?

206
00:20:54,202 --> 00:20:55,508
Sis... I'm..

207
00:20:57,006 --> 00:20:58,016
Listen...

208
00:22:21,588 --> 00:22:25,428
Three days since the quake. Many
cases of Crush Syndrome reported.
