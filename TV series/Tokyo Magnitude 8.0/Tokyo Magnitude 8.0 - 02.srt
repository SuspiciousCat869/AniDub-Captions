1
00:01:24,873 --> 00:01:27,233
Nothing but bad things happen to me.

2
00:01:28,524 --> 00:01:31,458
The whole world can fall apart, for all I care.

3
00:02:27,495 --> 00:02:29,607
Sis, I gotta go to the toilet.

4
00:02:30,433 --> 00:02:31,291
Yuuki.

5
00:02:37,894 --> 00:02:38,966
YUUKI!

6
00:02:44,292 --> 00:02:47,040
BROKEN WORLD

7
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:28,388
What do I do?

8
00:03:56,998 --> 00:03:59,088
Don't just stand there! You idiot!

9
00:04:15,551 --> 00:04:17,989
Yu... Yuuki?

10
00:04:21,365 --> 00:04:22,223
Excuse me...

11
00:04:23,125 --> 00:04:24,170
A little boy...

12
00:04:24,249 --> 00:04:26,388
Have any of you seen a little boy?

13
00:04:34,313 --> 00:04:35,429
He must still be...

14
00:04:35,914 --> 00:04:37,192
in the rest room.

15
00:04:56,176 --> 00:04:57,167
Yuuki?

16
00:04:59,191 --> 00:05:00,299
Yuuki?

17
00:05:02,577 --> 00:05:03,611
Yuuki!

18
00:05:09,593 --> 00:05:10,578
Yuuki!

19
00:05:25,991 --> 00:05:26,746
Yuuki?

20
00:05:33,437 --> 00:05:37,329
The exit's this way!
Please, keep calm and keep moving!

21
00:05:40,279 --> 00:05:43,920
You! Come back! It's dangerous that way!

22
00:05:48,071 --> 00:05:50,509
You there! Girl! Come back!

23
00:05:50,858 --> 00:05:52,572
You can't go that way!

24
00:05:53,309 --> 00:05:55,445
The quake started a fire in that section.

25
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:57,730
Now get out through the west entrance!

26
00:05:57,885 --> 00:06:00,464
But... But I... I have to...

27
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,538
A quake...

28
00:06:33,923 --> 00:06:35,835
That was close, wasn't it?

29
00:06:36,389 --> 00:06:38,974
I guess that's what they call "safe by a hair".

30
00:06:39,412 --> 00:06:40,795
Thank you very much...

31
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:44,009
Aren't you the girl I just...?

32
00:06:48,273 --> 00:06:49,233
Can you stand?

33
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:54,199
You're alone?

34
00:06:55,159 --> 00:06:56,634
Where's your little brother?

35
00:06:58,856 --> 00:07:01,127
I let him go to the rest room by himself.

36
00:07:01,152 --> 00:07:02,713
What about your dad and mom?

37
00:07:04,047 --> 00:07:06,497
My brother and I came here by ourselves.

38
00:07:08,979 --> 00:07:10,260
I have to find him.

39
00:07:18,684 --> 00:07:20,040
You're a good sister.

40
00:07:24,094 --> 00:07:28,115
I let him go to the rest room by himself...

41
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:29,186
Did you look there?

42
00:07:30,316 --> 00:07:31,410
But he was gone!

43
00:07:31,983 --> 00:07:32,783
His name?

44
00:07:33,312 --> 00:07:33,940
Huh?

45
00:07:34,071 --> 00:07:35,361
What's your brother's name?

46
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:37,744
Yuuki.

47
00:07:39,244 --> 00:07:42,248
Yuuki? Yuuki!

48
00:07:43,775 --> 00:07:45,900
Well, come on. Let's find your brother.

49
00:07:53,753 --> 00:07:55,044
Yuuki!

50
00:07:55,844 --> 00:07:56,965
Yuuki?

51
00:07:59,323 --> 00:08:02,457
Yuuki!

52
00:08:03,704 --> 00:08:05,122
Yuuki, are you here?

53
00:08:17,343 --> 00:08:18,277
They're hurt.

54
00:08:18,884 --> 00:08:21,862
Yeah. This earthquake was incredible.

55
00:08:22,553 --> 00:08:23,339
Yuuki...

56
00:08:24,157 --> 00:08:25,229
Excuse me.

57
00:08:25,886 --> 00:08:28,073
Have you seen a little boy by himself?

58
00:08:28,307 --> 00:08:30,027
He'd be about 7 or 8.

59
00:08:31,751 --> 00:08:33,461
I have seen boys, but...

60
00:08:35,041 --> 00:08:36,463
They were all with their parents.

61
00:08:37,552 --> 00:08:39,966
Sorry I can't be of any more help you.

62
00:08:40,318 --> 00:08:42,874
No, that's okay. Thanks.

63
00:08:44,271 --> 00:08:48,150
Excuse me, have you seen a little boy by himself?

64
00:08:48,438 --> 00:08:50,853
About this tall, maybe 7 or 8?

65
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:57,620
Excuse me! He was wearing a pea-green
T-shirt. It had a line going across his chest!

66
00:08:58,007 --> 00:09:00,583
He's... He's my little brother!

67
00:09:03,406 --> 00:09:05,755
I'm sorry, I haven't seen him.

68
00:09:05,984 --> 00:09:09,576
I saw a few boys down in the
toy shop on the first floor, but...

69
00:09:10,028 --> 00:09:12,413
You did?! Thank you so much!

70
00:09:13,002 --> 00:09:13,675
Wait!

71
00:09:30,651 --> 00:09:34,484
Let's look for another stairway.
This one seem too dangerous.

72
00:09:35,453 --> 00:09:36,987
No! Come back!

73
00:09:45,617 --> 00:09:46,288
Wait!

74
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:15,457
Come on.

75
00:10:22,158 --> 00:10:26,694
Look, Sister... Don't do anything that reckless again.
Will you?

76
00:10:27,135 --> 00:10:29,139
You know how dangerous that was, don't you?

77
00:10:29,164 --> 00:10:31,119
But, Yuuki's in the toy shop!

78
00:10:31,144 --> 00:10:34,803
I know! But what's the point if
you get yourself hurt, too?

79
00:10:36,956 --> 00:10:38,306
"If I get hurt too?"

80
00:10:38,466 --> 00:10:39,674
You don't say that!

81
00:10:39,699 --> 00:10:41,335
You don't know that Yuuki is hurt.

82
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,814
You don't know that he is hurt!

83
00:10:43,452 --> 00:10:46,008
Stop! It's dangerous that way!

84
00:10:52,019 --> 00:10:52,743
Stop!

85
00:10:57,776 --> 00:10:59,339
No! Let me go!

86
00:11:01,008 --> 00:11:03,911
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have
spoken to you that way.

87
00:11:04,444 --> 00:11:07,380
Your little brother's all right. He's all right...

88
00:11:08,602 --> 00:11:12,658
I'll help you find him, just stop being so reckless.

89
00:11:17,875 --> 00:11:18,934
Yuuki?

90
00:11:19,593 --> 00:11:21,161
Yuuki!

91
00:11:22,107 --> 00:11:23,162
Yuuki!

92
00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:24,844
Yuuki?

93
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:26,927
We've almost got it!

94
00:11:26,952 --> 00:11:28,030
Okay... Lift!

95
00:11:33,061 --> 00:11:33,888
Yuuki?!

96
00:11:46,955 --> 00:11:48,340
YUUKI!

97
00:12:12,934 --> 00:12:15,458
Are you okay? Is anyone hurt?

98
00:12:15,951 --> 00:12:20,824
We're fine. Please, this place is dangerous.
You should both evacuate quickly.

99
00:12:20,849 --> 00:12:23,441
Please, we're looking for a little boy.

100
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:25,896
He's wearing a pea-green shirt.

101
00:12:28,188 --> 00:12:32,092
We've searched the whole place already.
This child is the last one.

102
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:33,798
The rest are...!

103
00:12:36,627 --> 00:12:39,030
Yuuki! Where are you?!

104
00:12:39,214 --> 00:12:41,634
Answer me, Yuuki!

105
00:12:46,606 --> 00:12:49,850
Yuuki! Yuuki!

106
00:12:56,372 --> 00:12:59,119
Sister... Let's get out of here.

107
00:13:00,584 --> 00:13:04,035
It's dangerous here.
Come on, while the smoke isn't too thick.

108
00:13:04,183 --> 00:13:04,841
No!

109
00:13:05,471 --> 00:13:09,452
Go by yourself if you're leaving!
I won't leave Yuuki behind!

110
00:13:09,477 --> 00:13:10,770
Then consider this!

111
00:13:10,921 --> 00:13:13,233
Can you afford to let yourself get killed?!

112
00:13:13,329 --> 00:13:16,210
If Yuuki's alive, he's trying
to get out of here, too!

113
00:13:16,608 --> 00:13:18,220
That's why you mustn't die!

114
00:13:18,245 --> 00:13:20,986
Stay alive, and you'll find him, right?!

115
00:13:32,468 --> 00:13:33,828
Yuuki...!

116
00:13:37,714 --> 00:13:40,420
Oh, after you're done, buy us a drink!

117
00:13:41,514 --> 00:13:43,620
A drink! Hey wait!

118
00:13:44,513 --> 00:13:45,581
Where are you going?!

119
00:13:45,922 --> 00:13:47,663
Just let me check in here!

120
00:13:59,669 --> 00:14:00,369
Come on.

121
00:14:01,152 --> 00:14:02,592
Is someone there?

122
00:14:03,606 --> 00:14:07,281
Help me! Over here! Help me, please!

123
00:14:07,306 --> 00:14:08,764
W-We're coming!

124
00:14:09,582 --> 00:14:10,370
Sis?

125
00:14:12,357 --> 00:14:14,017
Sis, is that you?

126
00:14:14,810 --> 00:14:15,836
Yuuki!

127
00:14:16,192 --> 00:14:16,948
Sis!

128
00:14:17,819 --> 00:14:20,388
Yuuki! Are you hurt?!

129
00:14:20,572 --> 00:14:21,946
I'm okay.

130
00:14:22,429 --> 00:14:25,315
Just hang on! I'll get you out of there in a second!

131
00:14:25,475 --> 00:14:26,196
'Kay...

132
00:14:26,464 --> 00:14:27,577
Grab that side!

133
00:14:27,762 --> 00:14:28,704
Right!

134
00:14:34,106 --> 00:14:35,217
Sis!

135
00:14:35,242 --> 00:14:37,550
Yuuki! Yuuki!

136
00:14:37,886 --> 00:14:39,059
Thank you so much.

137
00:14:39,116 --> 00:14:41,635
Thank God, you're okay! Thank God...

138
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:42,452
Sis...

139
00:14:51,062 --> 00:14:51,924
It's raining...

140
00:14:52,694 --> 00:14:54,535
Do we wait till it lets up?

141
00:14:54,588 --> 00:14:55,860
It's dangerous here.

142
00:14:56,191 --> 00:14:57,273
Let's keep moving.

143
00:15:06,998 --> 00:15:07,899
A fire?

144
00:15:08,081 --> 00:15:08,693
Emm..

145
00:15:09,895 --> 00:15:10,697
Hi, Yuuki.

146
00:15:31,425 --> 00:15:33,593
Maybe we can stay out of the rain here.

147
00:15:34,029 --> 00:15:34,831
Right.

148
00:15:37,425 --> 00:15:38,441
Thank goodness.

149
00:15:38,535 --> 00:15:39,370
Yeah.

150
00:15:53,001 --> 00:15:54,227
Can't get through?

151
00:15:55,431 --> 00:15:56,854
No luck here, either.

152
00:15:57,113 --> 00:15:59,487
The release in Ohmoto were probably destroyed.

153
00:16:00,646 --> 00:16:01,709
To repeat...

154
00:16:01,734 --> 00:16:05,555
today at 3:45 PM,
approximately four hours ago

155
00:16:05,763 --> 00:16:09,280
a massive earthquake occurred,
centered in the Kanto region.

156
00:16:09,305 --> 00:16:12,691
The quake's epicenter was in the
northern area of Tokyo Bay,

157
00:16:12,716 --> 00:16:15,416
at a depth of approximately 25 kilometers.

158
00:16:16,035 --> 00:16:19,268
The scale of the earthquake
is estimated at magnitude 8.0...

159
00:16:19,474 --> 00:16:21,242
Magnitude 8!

160
00:16:21,267 --> 00:16:22,893
Please be careful of aftershocks and possible tsunamis.

161
00:16:22,918 --> 00:16:25,465
C'mon. We can watch it on here.

162
00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:26,808
Your phone works?

163
00:16:31,368 --> 00:16:36,866
According to the Tokyo fire department, large
scale fires have broken out in all sections of the city.

164
00:16:37,541 --> 00:16:40,697
I wonder if Dad and Mom are okay...

165
00:16:40,829 --> 00:16:42,596
Where do you live? Close by?

166
00:16:42,621 --> 00:16:44,042
Near Kinuta Park.

167
00:16:44,644 --> 00:16:46,808
Oh, around Seijo, huh?

168
00:16:46,904 --> 00:16:48,784
I live in Sangenjaya.

169
00:16:49,036 --> 00:16:51,360
Dammit, I can't get through at all!

170
00:16:51,789 --> 00:16:54,311
The only thing working is the one sag network.

171
00:16:54,786 --> 00:16:57,190
Let's wait a little longer and see what develops.

172
00:16:57,268 --> 00:16:59,838
They may give us an idea about
how we can all get home.

173
00:17:02,739 --> 00:17:05,557
Why are you being so nice to us anyway?

174
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:08,168
I don't know...

175
00:17:08,453 --> 00:17:11,261
Because it's human?
Or some such?

176
00:17:13,192 --> 00:17:16,261
Your big sister here went
half crazy trying to find you.

177
00:17:17,177 --> 00:17:18,727
She's a good sister, huh?

178
00:17:20,336 --> 00:17:21,301
Thank you!

179
00:17:23,903 --> 00:17:27,188
We have to get you home soon so
you can give that to your mom.

180
00:17:29,973 --> 00:17:33,170
I just realized. I still haven't told you my name.

181
00:17:33,530 --> 00:17:35,849
I'm Mari, Mari Kusakabe.

182
00:17:36,019 --> 00:17:38,161
And you're Yuuki and...?

183
00:17:40,088 --> 00:17:42,190
Mirai Onozawa.

184
00:17:42,393 --> 00:17:46,318
Oh, Mirai, huh? That's a good name.

185
00:17:46,951 --> 00:17:48,546
I don't like it much.

186
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:51,530
Well, I like your name, Sis. It's pretty.

187
00:17:52,098 --> 00:17:52,493
Oh.

188
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:54,058
You're in middle school?

189
00:17:55,259 --> 00:17:56,433
Seventh grade.

190
00:17:56,699 --> 00:17:58,070
How about you, Yuuki?

191
00:17:58,095 --> 00:17:59,134
Third grade!

192
00:17:59,552 --> 00:18:03,116
Coming out here all by yourselves...
You must be very close.

193
00:18:03,141 --> 00:18:04,085
Not really...

194
00:18:05,090 --> 00:18:07,860
It's all her mother's fault that this happened anyway.

195
00:18:09,006 --> 00:18:10,808
Everything with her is always work.

196
00:18:10,895 --> 00:18:13,102
She's the one who told me to take him here.

197
00:18:14,914 --> 00:18:16,552
That's kind of harsh, isn't it?

198
00:18:17,552 --> 00:18:19,819
I live at home with my mother and daughter,

199
00:18:20,143 --> 00:18:23,825
but I work so much,
I hardly have time for my little girl.

200
00:18:28,634 --> 00:18:30,761
She loves to play on the swings,

201
00:18:30,786 --> 00:18:34,771
so she said she wants me to work hard,
so we can move to a house with one.

202
00:18:35,918 --> 00:18:37,144
But if I don't hurry,

203
00:18:37,690 --> 00:18:40,346
she might end up too old to sit on a swing.

204
00:18:41,799 --> 00:18:42,460
That's right.

205
00:18:44,122 --> 00:18:47,980
I have a little something to get.
I left it on my bike near here.

206
00:18:54,144 --> 00:18:56,855
That one, might not come back.

207
00:19:21,841 --> 00:19:24,504
She's not coming back, is she?

208
00:19:24,837 --> 00:19:26,154
She left us here.

209
00:19:26,667 --> 00:19:29,582
She doesn't have any
obligation to take care of us.

210
00:19:35,154 --> 00:19:36,144
It's okay.

211
00:19:37,164 --> 00:19:38,612
They're called aftershocks.

212
00:19:38,819 --> 00:19:41,522
You get a bunch of them like
this after a major quake.

213
00:19:42,859 --> 00:19:46,399
That was a little one just now.
I'm sure we're safe here.

214
00:19:47,961 --> 00:19:50,261
By the way, are you two hungry?

215
00:19:51,026 --> 00:19:52,995
I've got some cake, so...

216
00:19:55,341 --> 00:19:56,709
Ta-dah!

217
00:19:58,134 --> 00:20:00,926
Whoa... Well, it still tastes the same, right?

218
00:20:04,575 --> 00:20:05,476
Birthday?

219
00:20:05,619 --> 00:20:08,552
Yeah. Today's my little girl's birthday.

220
00:20:08,810 --> 00:20:10,877
She just turned four today.

221
00:20:11,707 --> 00:20:12,411
Hina...

222
00:20:12,436 --> 00:20:14,945
Yeah... Okay, here you go.

223
00:20:16,444 --> 00:20:18,075
Thank you very much Mari.

224
00:20:18,705 --> 00:20:19,988
It's great!

225
00:20:20,913 --> 00:20:22,525
Even though it's a mess.

226
00:20:23,048 --> 00:20:24,161
But it's round...

227
00:20:25,963 --> 00:20:29,603
Birthday cakes should always be round.
It's like a rule, you know.

228
00:20:31,606 --> 00:20:32,759
You're right.

229
00:20:38,257 --> 00:20:40,323
What are we supposed to do now?

230
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:45,789
Good question... For now, let's get some sleep.

231
00:20:46,517 --> 00:20:49,696
I have a feeling tomorrow's
going to be a busy day.

232
00:22:21,664 --> 00:22:25,365
Communications have collapsed.
Massive casualties likely.
