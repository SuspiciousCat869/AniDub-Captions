1
00:02:04,138 --> 00:02:07,073
Mirai, are you sure you'll be all right by yourself?

2
00:02:09,431 --> 00:02:11,816
My house is close, so...

3
00:02:12,925 --> 00:02:15,106
Maybe you should wait at the school.

4
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:17,819
I'll go find her.

5
00:02:27,659 --> 00:02:31,027
I can't go home... Not by myself.

6
00:02:32,897 --> 00:02:36,752
Without Yuuki... Dad and Mom will be so sad.

7
00:02:44,462 --> 00:02:48,286
DEAR YUUKI...

8
00:03:00,044 --> 00:03:01,524
Why Yuuki?

9
00:03:03,849 --> 00:03:06,903
Listen... I...

10
00:03:08,619 --> 00:03:10,034
I died.

11
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:14,911
Yuuki...

12
00:03:29,832 --> 00:03:30,565
Yuuki.

13
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,478
Let's go home.

14
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:50,894
Hey, Yuuki...

15
00:03:54,628 --> 00:03:58,203
Yuuki, you're... You're gone now.

16
00:04:00,873 --> 00:04:03,224
But, you're so kind

17
00:04:04,481 --> 00:04:08,216
that you're staying with me so
that I won't be sad, aren't you?

18
00:04:16,561 --> 00:04:19,797
I just wanted to be with you, sis.

19
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:23,452
And I wanted us to go home together.

20
00:04:24,066 --> 00:04:25,177
Yuuki...

21
00:04:29,951 --> 00:04:31,161
Let's go home.

22
00:04:41,835 --> 00:04:45,405
I promised to bring you home, didn't I?

23
00:04:59,331 --> 00:05:01,957
Look, Yuuki. We're finally home.

24
00:05:01,982 --> 00:05:02,606
Uh-huh.

25
00:05:08,169 --> 00:05:10,354
Hey look, Mom might be here.

26
00:05:11,327 --> 00:05:12,115
Uh-huh.

27
00:05:15,447 --> 00:05:16,144
Mom?

28
00:05:29,643 --> 00:05:31,122
Mom! Mom!

29
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:41,472
Mom?

30
00:05:42,474 --> 00:05:43,450
Mama!

31
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:55,114
Sis.

32
00:05:59,971 --> 00:06:01,177
Thanks a lot.

33
00:06:04,251 --> 00:06:05,030
Yuuki...

34
00:06:13,229 --> 00:06:14,343
No... you can't.

35
00:06:14,607 --> 00:06:17,071
Yuuki, please don't go away.

36
00:06:17,943 --> 00:06:19,688
I have to go away.

37
00:06:20,873 --> 00:06:23,000
What? What did you say?

38
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:26,488
I'll always be right here.

39
00:06:28,418 --> 00:06:29,214
Sorry.

40
00:06:29,873 --> 00:06:31,447
I can't hear you.

41
00:06:31,472 --> 00:06:33,193
I can't hear you, Yuuki.

42
00:06:33,384 --> 00:06:34,384
Don't go.

43
00:06:37,212 --> 00:06:38,355
Don't leave me...

44
00:06:40,743 --> 00:06:42,929
Hey, sis, I love you.

45
00:06:49,996 --> 00:06:50,823
Mirai...

46
00:06:52,196 --> 00:06:52,910
Mama...

47
00:06:55,661 --> 00:06:56,924
MIRAI!

48
00:06:58,099 --> 00:06:59,054
Mom...

49
00:07:07,737 --> 00:07:08,638
Mom...

50
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:40,567
I'm proud of you, Mirai.

51
00:07:41,423 --> 00:07:42,877
It must have been awful.

52
00:07:46,782 --> 00:07:49,108
Thank heaven, you made it back alive.

53
00:07:50,462 --> 00:07:51,434
But, Yuuki...

54
00:07:53,505 --> 00:07:55,765
I'm sorry. But he...

55
00:07:55,878 --> 00:07:57,472
It wasn't your fault, Mirai.

56
00:07:57,934 --> 00:07:59,324
It was all my fault!

57
00:07:59,832 --> 00:08:02,146
Cause I sent you two off on your own!

58
00:08:03,077 --> 00:08:04,234
No, you're wrong.

59
00:08:05,355 --> 00:08:07,253
It was because we were arguing.

60
00:08:08,086 --> 00:08:10,201
That's why... Yuuki was...

61
00:08:11,898 --> 00:08:12,728
Mirai.

62
00:08:18,056 --> 00:08:20,411
Thank you. For being with Yuuki to the end.

63
00:08:24,058 --> 00:08:26,858
Yuuki was with me the whole way.

64
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:29,737
Right till I made it home.

65
00:08:31,902 --> 00:08:33,703
So that I wouldn't be sad.

66
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:35,965
So that I wouldn't stop.

67
00:08:36,626 --> 00:08:38,236
So that I would make it home.

68
00:08:39,051 --> 00:08:41,455
He never left my side.

69
00:08:42,942 --> 00:08:44,566
That's why I only made it home

70
00:08:45,304 --> 00:08:46,342
thanks to Yuuki.

71
00:08:48,044 --> 00:08:49,498
He kept telling me.

72
00:08:49,593 --> 00:08:53,721
How much he wanted to tell Dad and Mom when we got home.

73
00:08:54,825 --> 00:08:59,202
How he wanted us all to go to Odaiba, to go to grandpa's.

74
00:09:00,364 --> 00:09:02,407
He wanted us all to go together.

75
00:09:04,038 --> 00:09:08,467
How he wanted us all to hold hands
as a family and cross the bridge.

76
00:09:09,007 --> 00:09:11,223
Yuuki kept telling me, over and over.

77
00:09:12,078 --> 00:09:13,437
"Let's go home."

78
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:16,792
Mirai.

79
00:09:18,584 --> 00:09:19,716
Mirai.

80
00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:21,732
Yuuki.

81
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:23,940
Yuuki.

82
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,309
Yuuki.

83
00:10:00,368 --> 00:10:01,150
Where's Mirai?

84
00:10:03,085 --> 00:10:05,033
I still can't get her out of bed.

85
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:07,882
I see.

86
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:23,727
Yuuki.

87
00:10:39,671 --> 00:10:41,835
Look, Sis! I drew you a frog!

88
00:11:16,604 --> 00:11:18,572
Maybe you should stop doing that.

89
00:11:27,957 --> 00:11:28,502
Yeah?

90
00:11:29,823 --> 00:11:31,063
Food's ready, Mirai.

91
00:11:31,165 --> 00:11:32,769
Why don't you join us?

92
00:11:37,656 --> 00:11:40,760
It's been one month since the
northern Tokyo Bay earthquake,

93
00:11:40,785 --> 00:11:42,167
and little by little, the...

94
00:11:42,192 --> 00:11:43,946
There's salad, too. Want some?

95
00:11:45,713 --> 00:11:49,239
...however, many areas still
remain without essential utilities,

96
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:12,011
With all the commotion we've had, I
can't believe it's the end of August now!

97
00:12:14,433 --> 00:12:15,537
Is that really?

98
00:12:19,321 --> 00:12:20,876
Yes! Coming!

99
00:12:30,137 --> 00:12:32,625
How do you do? My name's Kusakabe.

100
00:12:33,509 --> 00:12:35,639
You're Mari, aren't you?

101
00:12:36,626 --> 00:12:37,366
Yes.

102
00:12:38,388 --> 00:12:41,516
Forgive me. I should have come sooner.

103
00:12:42,658 --> 00:12:44,073
No, forgive me.

104
00:12:44,478 --> 00:12:47,048
I was the one who call you out here like this

105
00:12:47,438 --> 00:12:49,360
I think she'll be happy to see you.

106
00:12:50,908 --> 00:12:53,270
So, where's Mirai?

107
00:12:57,932 --> 00:12:58,821
Mirai.

108
00:13:04,149 --> 00:13:04,963
Mari.

109
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:09,055
Have you gotten a little thinner?

110
00:13:09,597 --> 00:13:10,937
I don’t' know, have I?

111
00:13:11,184 --> 00:13:12,608
I've been eating all right.

112
00:13:12,633 --> 00:13:14,097
I guess, it's not bad.

113
00:13:16,934 --> 00:13:18,335
It's so bright out.

114
00:13:19,302 --> 00:13:21,440
Except you feel like you're suffocating.

115
00:13:23,001 --> 00:13:25,698
Morning comes, the sun rises.

116
00:13:26,395 --> 00:13:29,178
You see everyone around you, looking so happy.

117
00:13:29,873 --> 00:13:31,665
And it's like you're in a daze.

118
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:34,542
When my husband died.

119
00:13:35,073 --> 00:13:37,848
When he suddenly vanished, right before my eyes,

120
00:13:38,185 --> 00:13:39,332
that's how I felt.

121
00:13:40,252 --> 00:13:42,510
I don't remember anything about the funeral.

122
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:46,142
How did I even manage to breathe through all that?

123
00:13:47,042 --> 00:13:48,620
But, there was Hina.

124
00:13:49,561 --> 00:13:51,305
Growing, day after day.

125
00:13:52,026 --> 00:13:53,870
Laughing, learning to talk.

126
00:13:55,267 --> 00:13:57,803
Sneezing in a way like my husband did...

127
00:14:00,239 --> 00:14:02,584
You and Yuuki were so much alike.

128
00:14:04,890 --> 00:14:05,851
You think so?

129
00:14:06,211 --> 00:14:06,874
Uh-huh.

130
00:14:09,014 --> 00:14:11,856
Yuuki's still alive, inside of you.

131
00:14:15,025 --> 00:14:15,733
Oh, yeah.

132
00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:18,635
Here you go.

133
00:14:31,274 --> 00:14:32,657
And also.

134
00:14:34,157 --> 00:14:35,105
Here.

135
00:14:37,152 --> 00:14:38,721
Sorry I took so long.

136
00:14:40,685 --> 00:14:43,518
But I thought I threw it away.

137
00:14:45,379 --> 00:14:48,317
Yuuki picked it up and brought it along.

138
00:15:17,816 --> 00:15:19,160
Yuka's okay.

139
00:15:22,834 --> 00:15:23,321
Huh?

140
00:15:24,010 --> 00:15:25,665
Hey, look, there's one from you.

141
00:15:29,130 --> 00:15:29,901
Yuuki...

142
00:15:35,873 --> 00:15:38,483
Dear Sis. I picked up your phone.

143
00:15:38,898 --> 00:15:41,691
You're a Cell Phonian, so I figured you'd miss it.

144
00:15:42,301 --> 00:15:44,024
I want a cell phone, too.

145
00:15:44,628 --> 00:15:47,523
Then I can send a ton of e-mails to you!

146
00:15:47,889 --> 00:15:51,983
That way, even when you can't
talk much, we can still have fun.

147
00:15:52,530 --> 00:15:54,694
And I want to take pictures, too!

148
00:15:54,928 --> 00:15:57,745
Let's get home soon and give Mom her present,

149
00:15:57,770 --> 00:15:59,282
and then take a picture of it.

150
00:16:03,254 --> 00:16:06,083
So, let's try hard and keep walking!

151
00:16:06,631 --> 00:16:08,212
From Yuuki.

152
00:16:08,764 --> 00:16:09,601
Yuuki...

153
00:16:12,564 --> 00:16:13,351
Mirai.

154
00:16:16,218 --> 00:16:19,557
Yuuki really did try hard, didn't he?

155
00:16:20,224 --> 00:16:23,028
His head must have been hurting him so much.

156
00:16:23,707 --> 00:16:24,552
Uh-huh.

157
00:16:25,034 --> 00:16:27,358
He must have felt sick all that time.

158
00:16:27,883 --> 00:16:30,363
But he kept walking, and never complained.

159
00:16:31,929 --> 00:16:36,313
Even with all that food he hated to eat.

160
00:16:37,182 --> 00:16:38,923
Eating that hard bread.

161
00:16:39,608 --> 00:16:41,385
He was so brave.

162
00:16:43,655 --> 00:16:47,168
He really, really tried so hard.

163
00:16:49,307 --> 00:16:50,876
What do I do?

164
00:16:51,676 --> 00:16:53,328
Yuuki's gone now.

165
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:57,453
I miss him so much.

166
00:17:04,954 --> 00:17:06,327
Should I call Mirai?

167
00:17:07,286 --> 00:17:09,305
When she said goodbye to Mari,

168
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:12,173
she smiled and promised she'd visit her, but...

169
00:17:14,794 --> 00:17:16,503
She just needs some time.

170
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:19,291
Don't push yourself too hard, Dear.

171
00:17:20,481 --> 00:17:21,611
Or you, honey.

172
00:17:23,738 --> 00:17:24,877
Mirai.

173
00:17:28,037 --> 00:17:31,401
Are you hungry? Or maybe you want something to drink?

174
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:35,572
Mom... I know this is really late, but.

175
00:17:35,765 --> 00:17:36,882
Happy birthday.

176
00:17:39,399 --> 00:17:40,720
Yuuki picked it out.

177
00:17:41,619 --> 00:17:43,946
Because you like flowers, he said.

178
00:17:51,934 --> 00:17:53,347
And, there's also this.

179
00:17:54,082 --> 00:17:55,093
It says.

180
00:17:55,507 --> 00:17:57,098
"To Mom, from Yuuki."

181
00:18:02,079 --> 00:18:03,547
Oh, I just love it.

182
00:18:04,079 --> 00:18:05,414
Look at this, honey.

183
00:18:05,889 --> 00:18:08,980
Yeah. It looks just like you and Mirai.

184
00:18:09,439 --> 00:18:10,527
And you.

185
00:18:11,755 --> 00:18:14,835
Really? Does my face really look like that?

186
00:18:15,854 --> 00:18:16,926
Dear Yuuki,

187
00:18:17,676 --> 00:18:20,747
So much of you still remains in this house.

188
00:18:21,849 --> 00:18:24,123
When I'm asleep, when I'm awake,

189
00:18:24,735 --> 00:18:26,360
no matter what I do...

190
00:18:26,745 --> 00:18:28,332
I'm reminded of you.

191
00:18:29,569 --> 00:18:31,948
I'll probably always be sad.

192
00:18:32,811 --> 00:18:34,744
It'll probably always hurt.

193
00:18:35,732 --> 00:18:40,712
So, if the sadness and the pain
ever get too much for me to bear

194
00:18:41,493 --> 00:18:44,309
I'll tell you about it and not hold back.

195
00:18:45,101 --> 00:18:48,950
I'll tell you about the happy
times, and the fun times, too.

196
00:18:49,786 --> 00:18:51,651
You'll hear every little detail.

197
00:18:53,016 --> 00:18:53,939
Yuuki.

198
00:18:54,661 --> 00:18:55,615
Thank you.

199
00:18:55,873 --> 00:18:57,969
For being born as my little brother.

200
00:20:44,824 --> 00:20:46,721
I have to keep moving forward.

201
00:20:54,645 --> 00:20:55,999
Yuuki's watching.
