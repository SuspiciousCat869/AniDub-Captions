1
00:02:00,363 --> 00:02:02,400
Where's.. Mirai?

2
00:02:15,445 --> 00:02:16,473
Shall we go?

3
00:02:16,884 --> 00:02:17,957
Uh-huh!

4
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:23,058
Oh? Sis, you have shoes now.

5
00:02:23,749 --> 00:02:26,698
Nice, huh? I changed into my gym shoes.

6
00:02:27,214 --> 00:02:31,182
Yuuki, are you okay with us leaving this early?

7
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,434
I'm fine, but I think Sis will have trouble.

8
00:02:35,651 --> 00:02:36,322
Huh?

9
00:02:36,347 --> 00:02:38,708
'Cuz you're, like, the King of the Sleepyheads!

10
00:02:38,733 --> 00:02:40,513
You sleep until noon!

11
00:02:40,553 --> 00:02:44,225
Wha...?! That's so not true! I go to school, don't I?!

12
00:02:45,277 --> 00:02:47,159
Hey! Come back here!

13
00:02:54,268 --> 00:02:59,382
ABANDONED CHOICE

14
00:03:00,564 --> 00:03:05,395
If we walk up this street, we
should come out at Azabu Juuban, right?

15
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,146
The place where I work is right around there.

16
00:03:08,171 --> 00:03:13,454
Oh, really? Yeah, I go there
sometimes. There's a Ningyo Yaki store.

17
00:03:13,502 --> 00:03:16,319
I know that place. I go all the time.

18
00:03:16,795 --> 00:03:19,045
They're delicious when they're fresh out of the oven!

19
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:22,254
We might have met, even if the earthquake hadn't happened.

20
00:03:23,112 --> 00:03:26,638
You two would have met at the
ningyo-Yaki store someday, right?

21
00:03:27,168 --> 00:03:30,086
Then maybe I could have made friends with you!

22
00:03:32,507 --> 00:03:33,445
Maybe.

23
00:03:34,625 --> 00:03:36,035
I think we would have.

24
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,802
It's broken.

25
00:03:43,259 --> 00:03:44,238
Yeah, It is.

26
00:03:44,707 --> 00:03:46,098
Let's cross quickly.

27
00:03:46,386 --> 00:03:47,058
Uh.

28
00:03:48,476 --> 00:03:52,807
My aunt told me they built this place
in the time she was gone on a school trip.

29
00:03:52,866 --> 00:03:54,228
Can you believe that?

30
00:03:54,865 --> 00:03:56,198
You're making that up!

31
00:03:56,731 --> 00:03:58,090
She said it's true.

32
00:03:58,137 --> 00:03:58,955
Really?

33
00:03:59,063 --> 00:04:02,052
You couldn't do that in three days and two nights.

34
00:04:02,077 --> 00:04:03,065
...We'll begin with fires in Sangenjaya.

35
00:04:03,589 --> 00:04:05,766
According to information received thus far,

36
00:04:05,885 --> 00:04:09,415
large-scale fires broke out in areas around Setagaya...

37
00:04:09,585 --> 00:04:13,028
and Sangenjaya stations immediately after the main quake,

38
00:04:13,508 --> 00:04:15,009
He said Sangenjaya.

39
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:17,168
that's where Mari's house is! Isn't it?

40
00:04:17,409 --> 00:04:20,201
It's pretty far from the station, but...

41
00:04:28,851 --> 00:04:30,456
C'mon, connect.

42
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,591
Dammit! No good.

43
00:04:40,662 --> 00:04:42,710
And now with the weather report.

44
00:04:42,735 --> 00:04:46,538
Embankments around the Arakawa area
have collapsed, due to the typhoon.

45
00:04:46,611 --> 00:04:49,632
Dock landing craft from the United
States 7th fleet are moving in…

46
00:04:49,657 --> 00:04:50,962
What about Sancha?!

47
00:04:52,576 --> 00:04:53,318
I know!

48
00:04:56,468 --> 00:04:57,630
Excuse me!

49
00:04:58,374 --> 00:04:59,742
Is anyone in here?

50
00:05:09,367 --> 00:05:10,252
Dammit!

51
00:05:12,753 --> 00:05:16,529
I thought this phone might still be working.

52
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:23,435
Um... I think you should get home as soon as you can.

53
00:05:23,841 --> 00:05:26,088
You can leave us, if you want to.

54
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:29,895
There's no way I could do that!

55
00:05:34,835 --> 00:05:35,667
Sorry...

56
00:05:35,735 --> 00:05:37,837
I'm going to check out my office.

57
00:05:50,425 --> 00:05:52,989
I wonder if Hina's okay.

58
00:05:54,168 --> 00:05:54,616
Uh.

59
00:06:28,138 --> 00:06:28,732
Come on.

60
00:07:13,712 --> 00:07:15,400
Both of you! Over here!

61
00:07:30,967 --> 00:07:32,092
Is it over?

62
00:07:32,117 --> 00:07:32,679
Yeah.

63
00:07:33,429 --> 00:07:34,544
Thanks, Mari.

64
00:07:51,842 --> 00:07:53,260
Should've known...

65
00:07:57,696 --> 00:08:02,649
Um... Mari, if there's anything that we can do...

66
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:05,681
No. Thanks. It's OK.

67
00:08:17,912 --> 00:08:18,736
Hina...

68
00:08:24,718 --> 00:08:27,658
Mari?! What's wrong? Mari!

69
00:08:37,455 --> 00:08:38,336
Sis?

70
00:08:38,361 --> 00:08:40,236
Shh! Someone's coming!

71
00:08:48,653 --> 00:08:50,231
What's the noise?

72
00:08:50,742 --> 00:08:51,962
Yuuki, come on!

73
00:09:07,216 --> 00:09:09,036
Wait, what...? Who...?!

74
00:09:13,125 --> 00:09:13,988
DON'T!

75
00:09:23,068 --> 00:09:24,623
Mari, get up!

76
00:09:24,687 --> 00:09:25,750
Mari!

77
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:28,390
Mari?!

78
00:09:30,957 --> 00:09:33,341
Mari! What's wrong?! Mari!

79
00:09:37,386 --> 00:09:39,449
Oh, no. What do I do?

80
00:10:05,361 --> 00:10:07,824
Hina, dear. Snack time.

81
00:10:08,089 --> 00:10:09,189
Coming!

82
00:10:14,481 --> 00:10:16,078
Hina! Mother!

83
00:10:18,842 --> 00:10:20,676
Hina! Mother!

84
00:10:26,412 --> 00:10:28,559
Hina! Mother!

85
00:10:29,281 --> 00:10:30,851
Mommy!

86
00:10:33,611 --> 00:10:36,537
Mommy, help me! Mommy!

87
00:10:36,562 --> 00:10:39,378
Hina! Mother!

88
00:10:40,277 --> 00:10:41,874
HINA!

89
00:10:42,248 --> 00:10:45,822
Mari! Mari! Mari!

90
00:10:49,702 --> 00:10:50,661
Mari?!

91
00:10:54,595 --> 00:10:56,400
A... Aya...? Thank you.

92
00:10:56,425 --> 00:10:57,895
Oh, thank goodness.

93
00:10:58,104 --> 00:11:00,816
You really had me worried, you know that?

94
00:11:02,021 --> 00:11:03,530
How do you feel?

95
00:11:04,945 --> 00:11:07,552
Aya... Where are the children?

96
00:11:08,771 --> 00:11:11,810
They said they had to go out for
a while, but that they'd be back.

97
00:11:14,455 --> 00:11:15,449
Of all the...

98
00:11:16,523 --> 00:11:18,391
Mari, you shouldn't!

99
00:11:20,372 --> 00:11:21,439
Ah! Mari!

100
00:11:22,441 --> 00:11:25,251
Oh... You just need to rest.

101
00:11:25,727 --> 00:11:28,739
I'm fine. It's just anemia.

102
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:32,584
Were those kids friends of yours?

103
00:11:34,059 --> 00:11:37,486
I met them in Odaiba, right after the quake.

104
00:11:37,634 --> 00:11:41,293
Our homes are in the same
direction, so we're traveling together.

105
00:11:43,317 --> 00:11:45,888
Where did they say they were going?

106
00:11:47,412 --> 00:11:49,666
I don't know. They didn't tell me.

107
00:11:49,917 --> 00:11:51,110
They just left.

108
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:53,032
I see.

109
00:11:58,383 --> 00:12:02,558
An extremely strong aftershock occurred at 12:05 PM today.

110
00:12:02,737 --> 00:12:06,572
We have yet to receive exact
damage reports from all areas.

111
00:12:06,597 --> 00:12:09,918
Please keep away from any buildings
that show damage from the quake,

112
00:12:09,943 --> 00:12:13,914
roadway subsidences, or ground fissures that you may see.

113
00:12:14,152 --> 00:12:16,625
There is a possibility that buildings and roadways...

114
00:12:16,650 --> 00:12:17,894
Thank you, Aya.

115
00:12:19,262 --> 00:12:20,785
Oh, no. It's nothing.

116
00:12:21,219 --> 00:12:23,338
Have you been here the whole time?

117
00:12:23,775 --> 00:12:27,007
Yeah. I couldn't contact anyone who was out on delivery.

118
00:12:27,102 --> 00:12:30,058
So, I figured I'd wait as I get this place all cleaned up.

119
00:12:31,941 --> 00:12:33,552
That's admirable.

120
00:12:34,695 --> 00:12:37,933
It's nothing, really. Look, I live by myself.

121
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:40,075
It'd be hard for me to get home.

122
00:12:40,968 --> 00:12:45,837
Besides, I'm much safer here at the office than
in that broken-down apartment of mine, you know?

123
00:12:46,007 --> 00:12:47,432
Aya, tell me...

124
00:12:48,130 --> 00:12:52,875
Sorry. Have you heard anything
about how things are in Sangenjaya?

125
00:12:53,319 --> 00:12:55,696
It's... burning, isn't it?

126
00:12:56,851 --> 00:12:59,502
I glimpsed some stuff about it on the news, but...

127
00:12:59,542 --> 00:13:04,040
I see. Yeah, you're right. Sorry I asked.

128
00:13:04,065 --> 00:13:06,742
It's okay. You're worried, too, aren't you?

129
00:13:08,376 --> 00:13:13,421
Until I heard about the fires, I
thought Hina was safe with her grandmother.

130
00:13:14,153 --> 00:13:16,735
That's what I told myself, anyway...

131
00:13:23,733 --> 00:13:26,150
Nothing about Sancha anywhere.

132
00:13:27,253 --> 00:13:28,023
Oh, yeah!

133
00:13:46,209 --> 00:13:49,325
...and reports on the number of
dead and injured continue to rise.

134
00:13:49,705 --> 00:13:54,109
Next up, damage in the area around
yesterday's collapse of Tokyo Tower increases.

135
00:13:54,134 --> 00:13:55,355
You OK? Mari?

136
00:13:56,667 --> 00:14:00,162
Hina... She loves having her picture taken.

137
00:14:00,818 --> 00:14:03,014
She smiles so much when I do...

138
00:14:03,578 --> 00:14:06,830
That I end up taking a ton of them without thinking.

139
00:14:07,699 --> 00:14:12,080
Look... You can't take on every
little responsibility yourself.

140
00:14:12,105 --> 00:14:14,453
You're all that Hina has. OK?

141
00:14:14,478 --> 00:14:16,965
And you're worried about her too. I understand that.

142
00:14:20,668 --> 00:14:24,147
So... I promise to look after those two kids!

143
00:14:24,517 --> 00:14:26,928
Please, just get home as fast as you can!

144
00:14:27,014 --> 00:14:28,954
You'll move a lot faster on your own!

145
00:14:32,190 --> 00:14:34,338
You should get home as soon as you can.

146
00:14:37,605 --> 00:14:40,679
The fires that started in the
area around Sangenjaya station...

147
00:14:40,767 --> 00:14:44,929
immediately after the quake have burned
for two nights and continue even now!

148
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:45,916
Mari!

149
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:49,687
It's on TV, too.

150
00:14:49,712 --> 00:14:53,900
The damage zone from the fires that
started around Sangenjaya station has grown,

151
00:14:53,939 --> 00:14:55,680
The fire... It's spreading.

152
00:14:56,226 --> 00:14:59,487
Mari, the guy from the bike shop will lend us one.

153
00:14:59,566 --> 00:15:00,709
I'll get one for you!

154
00:15:00,734 --> 00:15:02,645
So please, just go home!

155
00:15:02,946 --> 00:15:03,946
Go home.

156
00:15:23,876 --> 00:15:25,735
Aya? Are you okay?

157
00:15:26,215 --> 00:15:27,148
Yeah...

158
00:15:27,831 --> 00:15:29,515
Mari, you're bleeding!

159
00:15:48,387 --> 00:15:50,035
Somebody, give me a hand!

160
00:15:50,764 --> 00:15:52,855
You okay? Speak to me!

161
00:15:58,930 --> 00:16:01,384
Mari! Where are you going?

162
00:16:02,202 --> 00:16:03,725
To look for those two!

163
00:16:04,376 --> 00:16:06,635
Mari, I'll look for them!

164
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:08,127
Please just go home.

165
00:16:08,625 --> 00:16:10,011
Go home to Hina!

166
00:16:18,329 --> 00:16:18,957
Aya...

167
00:16:20,027 --> 00:16:24,207
Stay here in the office. They
may come back before I find them.

168
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:35,929
Mirai! Yuuki!

169
00:16:41,749 --> 00:16:44,984
Mirai! Yuuki!

170
00:16:50,190 --> 00:16:52,802
Oh... Where did they go?

171
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:48,436
Sorry! You couldn't keep up?

172
00:17:50,434 --> 00:17:53,094
You can go on ahead! I'm slow!

173
00:17:54,938 --> 00:17:56,781
After I invited you?

174
00:17:56,972 --> 00:17:57,900
What?

175
00:17:58,687 --> 00:18:02,424
I invited you! I can't very well ditch you, can I?

176
00:18:35,204 --> 00:18:38,517
What made me remember that, at a time like this?

177
00:18:42,426 --> 00:18:43,601
That's right.

178
00:18:44,905 --> 00:18:46,844
I can't ditch them, can I?

179
00:18:53,129 --> 00:18:55,737
What do you think, Sis? Will this bike go fast?

180
00:18:56,108 --> 00:18:57,006
I don't know.

181
00:18:57,852 --> 00:18:59,921
But it's faster than walking, right?

182
00:19:00,272 --> 00:19:03,991
After we get home, I want to go visit Mari.

183
00:19:09,531 --> 00:19:11,719
Ah! You idiot! I can't hold it up!

184
00:19:17,344 --> 00:19:18,218
You okay?

185
00:19:18,557 --> 00:19:19,206
Yeah.

186
00:19:23,605 --> 00:19:25,370
Let's hurry up and get this to Mari.

187
00:19:25,395 --> 00:19:26,100
Uh.

188
00:19:27,445 --> 00:19:28,912
Ready, set...!

189
00:19:30,613 --> 00:19:31,367
Mari!

190
00:19:31,961 --> 00:19:34,236
You two are dripping with sweat.

191
00:19:36,573 --> 00:19:38,677
Mari, look. We borrowed this.

192
00:19:38,928 --> 00:19:41,774
You can get home faster if you ride this bike!

193
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:43,754
Thank you.

194
00:19:44,215 --> 00:19:46,687
And I'm sorry for worrying you. But...

195
00:19:46,948 --> 00:19:48,258
Let's take it back.

196
00:19:50,812 --> 00:19:53,345
But why? You can get home faster with this.

197
00:19:54,054 --> 00:19:57,395
Because all three of us can't ride this bike, right?

198
00:20:11,886 --> 00:20:14,455
Be careful on your way back, all of you.

199
00:20:14,569 --> 00:20:17,577
But, you'll be fine. Because Mari's with you.

200
00:20:18,749 --> 00:20:20,730
I'm gonna stay here for a while.

201
00:20:20,933 --> 00:20:23,082
If anything happens, please come back.

202
00:20:23,787 --> 00:20:25,608
That includes you two, okay?

203
00:20:26,034 --> 00:20:28,041
Don't expect a welcome party, though.

204
00:20:33,311 --> 00:20:35,220
Looks like it's going to rain today.

205
00:20:35,903 --> 00:20:38,883
Mari... Are you sure about this?

206
00:20:39,751 --> 00:20:40,097
Uh.

207
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:44,962
I know Hina's all right. She has my mother with her.

208
00:20:46,285 --> 00:20:46,796
Yeah.

209
00:20:49,479 --> 00:20:52,576
You're right. I'm sure she's fine.

210
00:22:21,339 --> 00:22:25,595
Azabu Juuban buried in rubble.
The search for survivors continues.
