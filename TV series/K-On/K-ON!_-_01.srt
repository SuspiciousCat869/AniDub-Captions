[Ui]
Sis, come on.
You'd better get out of bed.

8
00:00:35,076 --> 00:00:35,952
Sis--!

9
00:00:35,994 --> 00:00:37,037
Huh?!

10
00:00:37,078 --> 00:00:42,208
(Panicking)

11
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:46,046
Ah! I-it's eight!
I'm late! Oh!

12
00:00:46,087 --> 00:00:48,298
Hey, why the rush?

13
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:49,007
Hm?

14
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:50,800
(Rushing happy music)

00:00:50,842 --> 00:00:52,594
Whoa!

00:00:53,178 --> 00:00:54,429
Ugh!

18
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:01,436
See you later!

19
00:01:03,688 --> 00:01:05,190
Oh, good morning, Yui...

20
00:01:05,231 --> 00:01:07,400
[Yui]
Good morning!

00:01:07,442 --> 00:01:08,568
Uh?

[Girls]
Congratulations on
starting school here!

31
00:03:35,173 --> 00:03:37,008
Please join the Tennis Club!

32
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:38,343
The Judo Club's better!

33
00:03:38,385 --> 00:03:39,678
Please join the
Tea Ceremony Club!

34
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:41,680
Please join
the Abacus Club!

00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:43,682
Please, please!

36
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:44,974
Uh...

37
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:49,229
Hm...

38
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:51,272
Hm?

39
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:54,484
Hm...

40
00:03:55,568 --> 00:03:57,404
Hmmm...

41
00:03:59,114 --> 00:04:02,534
Uh...

42
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:04,577
[Nodoka]
What are you
groaning about, Yui?

43
00:04:04,619 --> 00:04:05,370
Hm?

44
00:04:05,412 --> 00:04:06,830
Oh, hello, Nodoka.

45
00:04:06,871 --> 00:04:09,249
I'm not sure which club
I should join-

46
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:11,167
What?! You haven't
decided on one?

47
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:14,421
It's already been two weeks
since school started!
You have to choose!

48
00:04:14,462 --> 00:04:17,132
B-but I'm absolutely
terrible at every sports,

49
00:04:17,173 --> 00:04:20,885
and I don't really get
any of the literary clubs.

50
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:22,095
(Exhales)

51
00:04:22,137 --> 00:04:24,222
This is how people
end up becoming NEETs.

52
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:27,267
You're pegged as a NEET just
because you don't join a club?

53
00:04:27,308 --> 00:04:28,977
You know, looking back on it,

54
00:04:29,019 --> 00:04:30,311
for as long as
I've know you,

55
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:32,230
you've never joined
a single club, have you?

56
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:33,773
<i>Crud!</i>

57
00:04:33,815 --> 00:04:36,568

59
00:04:39,404 --> 00:04:42,574

<i>should I be doing?</i>

60
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:53,960
[Ritsu]
Mio!

61
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:54,794
(Ritsu laughing)

62
00:04:54,836 --> 00:04:55,712
Ritsu?

63
00:04:55,754 --> 00:04:57,339
Let's go check out
the club!

64
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:58,715
Which club
do you mean?

65
00:04:58,757 --> 00:05:00,759
The Light Music Club,
what do ya' think?!

66
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,720
But I was planning on
joining the Literature Club.

67
00:05:03,762 --> 00:05:04,929
Ah!

68
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:07,474
I've already filled out
the application form.

69
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:09,893
(Groan)

70
00:05:09,934 --> 00:05:11,102
Rip.

71
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:14,314
Ah! What do you think
you're doing?

72
00:05:14,356 --> 00:05:16,149
[Ritsu]
C'mon, let's go!
Move it, move it!

73
00:05:16,191 --> 00:05:17,275
[Mio]
Cut it out!

74
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:18,693
(School bells)

75
00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:22,447
[Ritsu]
Huh? It's been disbanded?!

76
00:05:22,489 --> 00:05:24,157
Well, on the verge of
being disbanded.

77
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:26,868
All the students who were
in the club last year

78
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:28,453
have now graduated,

79
00:05:28,495 --> 00:05:29,788
so the club will be disbanded

80
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:32,082
unless four students
join this month.

81
00:05:32,123 --> 00:05:35,460
Oh, so that's why there wasn't
anyone in the Music Room.

82
00:05:35,502 --> 00:05:38,546
(Door opens)
[Yui] Ms. Yamanaka!

83
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:40,799
Hi, Yui. I'll be right there.

84
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:44,219
I'm sorry, I have a music class
to teach in a few minutes.

85
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:47,472
Light Music Club, good luck.

86
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:50,141
She sure was pretty, wasn't she?

87
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:52,102
That is not the issue here.

88
00:05:52,977 --> 00:05:53,895
Um...

89
00:05:53,937 --> 00:05:54,813
Oh...

90
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:56,272
Uh...

91
00:05:56,314 --> 00:05:59,567
Please hand out these syllabus
sheets to all the students.

92
00:06:02,904 --> 00:06:03,822
Syllabus sheets?

93
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:06,282
Oh, right!
So sorry about that!

94
00:06:06,324 --> 00:06:08,576
(Nervous giggles)

95
00:06:10,495 --> 00:06:12,914
<i>Hm? They're staring at me!</i>

96
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:15,208
[Ritsu]
Bad tempo.

97
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:16,209
Oh, no!

98
00:06:16,251 --> 00:06:17,335
[Ritsu]
She's useless.

99
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:19,170
I-I'm so sorry!

100
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:21,673
[Yamanaka]
Are you all right?

101
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:23,550
Ah!

102
00:06:23,591 --> 00:06:24,926
And clumsy.

103
00:06:24,968 --> 00:06:27,721
(Yui nervous crying)

104
00:06:27,762 --> 00:06:29,973
It's being disbanded,
so that's that.

105
00:06:30,015 --> 00:06:33,476
I'm gonna go join
the Literature Club...

106
00:06:33,518 --> 00:06:34,936
If I join and there
aren't any members,

107
00:06:34,978 --> 00:06:37,522
does that make me...
the club president

108
00:06:37,564 --> 00:06:40,692
Ah! Doesn't sound bad at all!

109
00:06:40,734 --> 00:06:42,402
[Yui]
Um, what was that club

110
00:06:42,444 --> 00:06:44,487
you were talking about
with those girls?

111
00:06:44,529 --> 00:06:46,114
[Yamanaka]
The Light Music Club?

112
00:06:46,156 --> 00:06:47,866
[Yui]
Yea. What is it?

113
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:50,535
[Yamanaka]
The Light Music Club is about
playing light-hearted music.

114
00:06:50,577 --> 00:06:52,912
Light... Music Club?

115
00:06:52,954 --> 00:06:56,082
[Yamanaka]
That's right.
The Light Music Club.

116

(Girls exercising outside)

117
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:04,591
So, what's your plan, Ritsu?

118
00:07:04,632 --> 00:07:06,843
We wait for
prospective members!

119
00:07:06,885 --> 00:07:08,136
We just wait?

120
00:07:08,178 --> 00:07:08,887
Wait!

121
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:10,180
Hm.

122
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:17,687
(Girls exercising outside)

123
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:24,736
Come on, let's go home.
(Door opens)

124
00:07:24,778 --> 00:07:28,740
Hello. I wanted to find out
about joining your club.

125
00:07:28,782 --> 00:07:30,158
Ah!

126
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:32,410
The Light Music Club?

127
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:33,953
No, I meant the Choir Club.

128
00:07:33,995 --> 00:07:36,331
But why not join the
Light Music Club instead?

129
00:07:36,373 --> 00:07:37,791
But... the Choir Clu--

130
00:07:37,832 --> 00:07:40,168
We need more members like you!

131
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:41,419
Please! I'm begging you!

132
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:42,837
You won't regret it! I promise!

133
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:45,048
Don't try to force her
to join, like that.

134
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:46,257
It's really rude!

135
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:47,592
(Ritsu crying)

136
00:07:47,634 --> 00:07:50,053
I'm going now. I'm sorry.

137
00:07:50,095 --> 00:07:51,471
[Ritsu]
Mio!

138
00:07:53,515 --> 00:07:55,350
What about that promise we made?

139
00:07:55,392 --> 00:07:57,185
Was that just a big lie?!

140
00:07:57,227 --> 00:08:01,898
That I would play drums and
that you would play the bass!

141
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:05,151
Our band!

142
00:08:05,193 --> 00:08:08,988
We've been saying forever
that we would start one! Huh?

143
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:13,451
We promised each other,
remember?!

144
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:16,871
That night we went to see
that concert together!

145
00:08:17,706 --> 00:08:19,207
This is it.

146
00:08:19,249 --> 00:08:22,168
This is, isn't it?

147
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:26,756
Were those sweet words
nothing but a big lie?!

148
00:08:26,798 --> 00:08:28,425
No, your flashback is.

149
00:08:28,466 --> 00:08:30,176
Oh, really it is?

150
00:08:31,052 --> 00:08:32,470
(Ritsu excited)

151
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:33,930
Mio, this is it!

152
00:08:33,972 --> 00:08:36,182
You and I are going to
play in a band together!

153
00:08:36,224 --> 00:08:37,434
Isn't that exciting!

154
00:08:37,475 --> 00:08:38,810
You forced the idea on me.

155
00:08:38,852 --> 00:08:41,271
Yea, but you said
you wanted to!

156
00:08:41,312 --> 00:08:42,981
Yes, I did, but...

157
00:08:43,023 --> 00:08:46,401
And if we went pro, we said we'd
split all the proceeds 70/30!

158
00:08:46,443 --> 00:08:48,153
Don't make stuff up.

159
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:49,487
(Tsumugi giggles)

160
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:51,573
Uh... Eh...

161
00:08:52,615 --> 00:08:54,701
This will be a
great deal of fun.

162
00:08:54,743 --> 00:08:57,078
The only instrument I can play
is the keyboard,

163
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,497
but I'd like to join your club
if you will have me.

164
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:00,498
Ah!

165
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,042
Thank you so much!

166
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:04,419
Now we only need one more
person to join us!

167
00:09:04,461 --> 00:09:07,047
Well, I suppose that means
I'm already a member?

168
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:08,340
Um, you're...

169
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:10,717
Tsumugi Kotobuki.

170
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:12,552
I'm Ritsu Tainaka, drums.

171
00:09:12,594 --> 00:09:14,971
This is Mio Akiyama,
she's on bass.

172
00:09:15,013 --> 00:09:19,351
Let's see...
Now we need a guitar player!

173
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:20,935
Oh...

174
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:23,521
Yui?

175
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:26,107
My high school years
are very important.

176
00:09:26,149 --> 00:09:27,692
I wanna do something...

177
00:09:27,734 --> 00:09:29,361
Well, then do it.

178
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:34,699
Ugh... But I have absolutely
no idea what it is I should do!

179
00:09:34,741 --> 00:09:36,576
Oh, good grief...

180
00:09:36,618 --> 00:09:38,870
(Yui whines)

181
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:40,955
Would you like any
french fries with that, Miss?

182
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:44,542
Ah, yes! I would love some,
thank you!

183
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:46,044
Thank you.

184
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:48,630
(Tsumugi giggles)

185
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:50,507
What is it?

186
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:53,593
This is my first time eating
in a fast food restaurant!

187
00:09:53,635 --> 00:09:55,011
How can that be?!

188
00:09:55,053 --> 00:09:56,930
I know it's silly,
but I've always dreamed of

189
00:09:56,971 --> 00:09:59,849
having someone ask me
if I wanted french fries.

190
00:09:59,891 --> 00:10:00,975
Huh?

191
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:03,228
Oh, I'm sorry!
Please begin the meeting.

192
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:06,231
Okay, this planning
meeting is now underway!

193
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:09,651
Our goal is to recruit
one more member by
the end of the month!

194
00:10:09,693 --> 00:10:11,403
[Tsumugi]
How in the world
do we do that?

195
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:14,280
[Ritsu]
That's why we're meeting,
to think of a way right now.

196
00:10:14,322 --> 00:10:18,284
For instance, offering people
an amazing prize if they
decide to join!

197
00:10:18,326 --> 00:10:19,911
[Mio]
Amazing prize?

198
00:10:19,953 --> 00:10:21,913
Yeah! Like some kind of
gift or something.

199
00:10:21,955 --> 00:10:25,083
Like a car, or a plane,
or a boat?

200
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:27,127
[Mio]
Amazing, but impractical.

201
00:10:27,168 --> 00:10:30,005
More along the lines of ice
cream or help with homework.

202
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:32,382
Who would join up for
something like that?

203
00:10:32,424 --> 00:10:34,342
What should we do, then?

204
00:10:34,384 --> 00:10:36,428
[Girls]
Hmm...

205
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:40,765
(Yui whines)

206
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:42,517
Plop.

207
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:44,269
The president shouldn't
lose interest!

208
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:46,938
Come up with something
to keep me interested!

209
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:49,399
Uh, I want to go home.

210
00:10:49,441 --> 00:10:51,818
Um, for now, why don't we...

211
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:53,778
[Girls]
One, two!

212
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:56,823
(Giggling)

213
00:10:59,117 --> 00:11:00,493
(School bells)

214
00:11:00,535 --> 00:11:04,581
There's... There's just one more
week remaining in April.

215
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:06,958
No one has answered our ads yet.

216
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,711
Disbanded before we're a band.

217
00:11:09,753 --> 00:11:12,339
[Ritsu]
I won't let that happen!

218
00:11:13,256 --> 00:11:14,341
Ah!

219
00:11:14,382 --> 00:11:15,842
Huh?

220
00:11:17,427 --> 00:11:18,470
Uh?

221
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:19,721
Hm...

222
00:11:19,763 --> 00:11:22,515
Wait, Light Music, huh?

223
00:11:22,557 --> 00:11:26,644
(Music and clapping)

224
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:29,522
(Yui laughing)

225
00:11:29,564 --> 00:11:31,566
You're very good at that, Yui.

226
00:11:31,608 --> 00:11:33,360
(Yui laughing)

227
00:11:34,861 --> 00:11:37,322
(Yui excited)

228
00:11:37,364 --> 00:11:39,032
I'm gonna do it!

229
00:11:44,746 --> 00:11:47,874
[Yui]
K-ON!

230
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:50,377
For the time being, I've decided
to join the Light Music Club!

231
00:11:50,418 --> 00:11:54,130
Oh, yeah? So what is it
that they do at this club?

232
00:11:54,172 --> 00:11:55,465
Dunno.

233
00:11:55,507 --> 00:11:56,925
Huh?

234
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:59,094
But since the name of
the club is "Light Music",

235
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:02,305
I figure they only do
really easy stuff.

236
00:12:02,347 --> 00:12:03,640
You know, like whistling.

237
00:12:03,682 --> 00:12:07,310
Sounds like they don't
have much ambition.

238
00:12:07,352 --> 00:12:10,021
You see? It looks like
they're some kind of band.

239
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:13,692
What? But I don't know
how to play the guitar!

240
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:15,944
Well then,
what can you play?

241
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:18,822
Umm... Umm...

242
00:12:19,531 --> 00:12:20,990
I can play castanets?

243
00:12:21,032 --> 00:12:24,369
(Playing castanets and humming)

244
00:12:25,787 --> 00:12:27,747
That's a perfect
fit for you.

245
00:12:27,789 --> 00:12:30,500
[Mio]
See? Look at this here...

246
00:12:30,542 --> 00:12:31,918
Good afternoon.

247
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:33,837
Good afternoon!

248
00:12:33,878 --> 00:12:36,047
A prospective member
has come forward.

249
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:37,173
Oh!

250
00:12:37,215 --> 00:12:39,426
Here. Isn't that
wonderful news?

251
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:42,178
Also, that's a lovely tea set,
but make sure you clean up

252
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:44,681
after yourselves once
you're done, all right?

253
00:12:44,723 --> 00:12:47,183
All right!

254
00:12:47,225 --> 00:12:48,268
Hm.

255
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:51,521
Yes! Now we won't
be disbanded!

256
00:12:51,563 --> 00:12:53,023
[Mio]
Yui Hirasawa...

257
00:12:53,064 --> 00:12:55,108
[Ritsu]
Just her name makes her
sound really awesome.

258
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:56,860
[Mio]
She's got to be a guitarist.

259
00:12:56,901 --> 00:12:59,029
[Tsumugi]
I can't wait to meet her.

260
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:02,282
Yeah! A real powerhouse
has joined us!

261
00:13:06,703 --> 00:13:08,538
[Yui]
<i>Light Music Club...</i>

262
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:10,040
<i>Light Music Club...</i>

263
00:13:10,081 --> 00:13:13,752
(Nervous moaning)

264
00:13:15,086 --> 00:13:17,047
<i>I-if I don't get down</i>
<i>this hallway,</i>

265
00:13:17,088 --> 00:13:19,799
<i>I won't reach the</i>
<i>Light Music Club!</i>

266
00:13:19,841 --> 00:13:21,301
(Gasp)

267
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:24,346
[Yamanaka]
Oh, hello!

268
00:13:30,977 --> 00:13:33,772
The Light Music Club,
is up in the Music Room.

269
00:13:40,403 --> 00:13:43,406
<i>This is the place?</i>

270
00:13:43,448 --> 00:13:46,409
<i>It won't be an easy thing</i>
<i>to say right after joining,</i>

271
00:13:46,451 --> 00:13:48,495
<i>but I've got to quit.</i>

272
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:51,748
<i>I wonder what kind of</i>
<i>people would join</i>
<i>the Light Music Club?</i>

273
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:54,084
[Scary Guy]
Oh, you want to quit, do you?

274
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:57,253
Did you think you could walk
away without any consequences?!

275
00:13:57,295 --> 00:13:59,547
(Yui screams)
I'll murder you!

276
00:13:59,589 --> 00:14:01,841
(Nervous moaning)

277
00:14:01,883 --> 00:14:05,303
<i>What am I gonna do?!</i>
(Yui whimpers)

278
00:14:05,345 --> 00:14:07,305
Wah!

279
00:14:07,347 --> 00:14:09,057
(Yui whimpers)

280
00:14:09,099 --> 00:14:11,601
You've got it all wrong!
You've got it all wrong!

281
00:14:11,643 --> 00:14:13,103
[Ritsu]
Hmm... Huh?

282
00:14:13,144 --> 00:14:15,438
<i>It's the useless, clumsy,</i>
<i>bad tempo girl!</i>

283
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,357
What is it your doing?

284
00:14:18,608 --> 00:14:19,984
Huh?

285
00:14:20,026 --> 00:14:21,444
You startled me!

286
00:14:21,486 --> 00:14:24,280
Uh... You aren't Yui Hirasawa
by any chance?

287
00:14:24,322 --> 00:14:25,156
Y-yes.

288
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:27,117
The girl who wants to join us?

289
00:14:27,158 --> 00:14:28,576
Y-yes!

290
00:14:28,618 --> 00:14:30,245
Aah!

291
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:32,122
I'm so sorry I misjudged you!

292
00:14:32,163 --> 00:14:34,290
I'm sure you must be
totally awesome on guitar!

293
00:14:34,332 --> 00:14:36,418
We've all been waiting
for you to get here!

294
00:14:36,459 --> 00:14:39,838
[Yui]
<i>It seems like somebody's been</i>
<i>embellishing things about me...</i>

295
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:41,089
Hey, guys!

296
00:14:41,131 --> 00:14:43,299
Our brand new member
has arrived!

297
00:14:43,341 --> 00:14:44,342
Is that her?!

00:14:44,384 --> 00:14:45,301
Ah!

Mmm... <i>Maybe I should</i>
<i>give up on trying to quit.</i>

311
00:15:21,046 --> 00:15:23,006
[Ritsu]
What kind of music
do you want to play?

312
00:15:23,048 --> 00:15:24,382
[Yui]
Huh?

313
00:15:24,424 --> 00:15:26,426
Whose your all-time
favorite band?

314
00:15:26,468 --> 00:15:27,344
Uh...

315
00:15:27,385 --> 00:15:29,804
Which guitarists do you like?

316
00:15:29,846 --> 00:15:32,265
Uh...

<i>Oh my, I have to tell them.</i>

Oh, are you trying to say
Jimi Hendrix?!

Whoa!

No, it's not,

No! No, I je-je-

00:15:51,826 --> 00:15:53,203
<i>whose names start with "J"?!</i>

328
00:15:53,244 --> 00:15:55,622
Oh wow, Jeff Beck,
that's cool!

329
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:56,706
Who is he?

330
00:15:56,748 --> 00:15:58,249
[Mio]
In the music world,

331
00:15:58,291 --> 00:16:00,210
they say that there's only
two kinds of rock guitarists:

332
00:16:00,251 --> 00:16:02,337
Jeff Beck, and everyone else.

333
00:16:02,379 --> 00:16:04,381
He's a brilliant and
challenging guitarist

334
00:16:04,422 --> 00:16:06,174
who's always searching
for new sounds.

335
00:16:06,216 --> 00:16:07,842
[Tsumugi]
My goodness!

336
00:16:07,884 --> 00:16:10,470
[Ritsu]
You're so hardcore,
Miss Hirasawa!

337
00:16:10,512 --> 00:16:11,930
(Yui nervous crying)

338
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:13,390
I gotta say,
I'm so glad

339
00:16:13,431 --> 00:16:15,642
that someone like her
joined the club!

340
00:16:15,684 --> 00:16:18,269
We were at the point where the
club would have been disbanded

341
00:16:18,311 --> 00:16:21,189
if we hadn't gotten another
member within the next week.

342
00:16:21,231 --> 00:16:23,108
Thank you so much
for joining!

343
00:16:23,149 --> 00:16:25,360
[Yui]
<i>They keep making it harder!</i>

344
00:16:25,402 --> 00:16:28,822
<i>But I'm... I'm just gonna</i>
<i>have to spit it out!</i>

345
00:16:28,863 --> 00:16:31,491
Um, I'm really sorry,
I don't know how to say it,

346
00:16:31,533 --> 00:16:33,410
but I made a mistake
joining this club,

347
00:16:33,451 --> 00:16:35,745
and I only came here
to beg you to let me quit!

348
00:16:35,787 --> 00:16:36,871
Wha...?

349
00:16:36,913 --> 00:16:38,665
I can't play the guitar.

350
00:16:38,707 --> 00:16:42,252
I thought you would be playing
a different kind of instrument.

351
00:16:42,293 --> 00:16:44,421
What instrument
can you play, then?

352
00:16:44,462 --> 00:16:45,255
Casta-

353
00:16:45,296 --> 00:16:46,756
Er, the harmonica.

354
00:16:46,798 --> 00:16:48,717
Oh, I have a harmonica
right here.

355
00:16:48,758 --> 00:16:49,801
Ah!
Try playing someth-

356
00:16:49,843 --> 00:16:51,302
I'm sorry, I can't play it!

357
00:16:51,344 --> 00:16:54,305
But, Miss Hirasawa, if you
wanted to join this club,

358
00:16:54,347 --> 00:16:57,100
that means that you're at least
interested in music, right?

359
00:16:57,142 --> 00:16:59,310
Is there another club
you'd rather join?

360
00:16:59,352 --> 00:17:02,355
Uh, no, none in particular...

361
00:17:02,397 --> 00:17:03,815
(gasp)

362
00:17:03,857 --> 00:17:06,151
<i>We can't let this mark leave</i>
<i>this room, no matter what.</i>

363
00:17:06,192 --> 00:17:08,737
<i>To keep the club</i>
<i>from being disbanded...</i>

364
00:17:08,778 --> 00:17:11,406
<i>...we have to keep</i>
<i>her here somehow!</i>

365
00:17:11,448 --> 00:17:14,117
I'm sorry.
I really mean it. Bye.

366
00:17:14,159 --> 00:17:15,452
[Ritsu]
Wait just a minute!

367
00:17:15,493 --> 00:17:16,911
[Tsumugi]
How about another cup of tea?

368
00:17:16,953 --> 00:17:18,204
But I-

369
00:17:18,246 --> 00:17:19,622
We have cookies and
madeleines, as well.

370
00:17:19,664 --> 00:17:20,749
Mhm!

371
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:22,584
[Mio]
<i>They're baiting the hook!</i>

372
00:17:23,418 --> 00:17:24,878
So good!

373
00:17:24,919 --> 00:17:28,798
I-I'm sorry, I didn't mean to
come here and gorge myself.

374
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:30,258
Hey, don't sweat it!

375
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:32,093
I think we should start
eating snacks like this

376
00:17:32,135 --> 00:17:33,386
every day from now on.

377
00:17:33,428 --> 00:17:36,473
Aren't we drifting
off topic here- OW!

378
00:17:36,514 --> 00:17:39,976
Miss Hirasawa, what other
sorts of things do you like?

379
00:17:40,018 --> 00:17:41,186
Uh...

380
00:17:41,227 --> 00:17:43,480
Oh, I like anything
that tastes good.

381
00:17:43,521 --> 00:17:45,065
<i>Geez, just food?</i>

382
00:17:45,106 --> 00:17:48,318
Mhm. On your days off,
do you spend your time at home

383
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:49,986
doing anything
in particular?

384
00:17:50,028 --> 00:17:53,490
Just sitting around,
I guess.

385
00:17:53,531 --> 00:17:55,075
What kinds of things
do you like?

386
00:17:55,116 --> 00:17:58,244
Um, I like cute things,
I guess.

387
00:17:58,286 --> 00:17:59,704
Have any weaknesses?

388
00:17:59,746 --> 00:18:02,582
I'm not very good with
extreme heat or cold.

389
00:18:02,624 --> 00:18:05,001
I spend winter under
the table where it's warm,

390
00:18:05,043 --> 00:18:08,963
and in the summer,
I spend my time on the floor
where it's cool.

391
00:18:09,005 --> 00:18:10,507
[Mio]
<i>She's a tough one.</i>

[Ritsu]
<i>What the heck do we do?</i>

393
00:18:12,342 --> 00:18:14,010
[Tsumugi]
I don't know.

394
00:18:14,052 --> 00:18:17,389
Um, I should go.

395
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:19,391
Don't go, I'm begging you!

396
00:18:19,432 --> 00:18:21,476
You can just hang out and
do nothing if you want!

397
00:18:21,518 --> 00:18:25,230
I'll try to bring even
tastier snacks, okay?!

398
00:18:25,271 --> 00:18:28,400
I-I'm really sorry.

399
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:32,070
I didn't take things seriously
when I applied to join...(sniff)

400
00:18:32,112 --> 00:18:34,698
I got all your hopes up.

401
00:18:34,739 --> 00:18:38,910
How can I ever apologize?

402
00:18:38,952 --> 00:18:40,078
(sighs)

403
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:42,414
We're the ones
who should apologize.

404
00:18:42,455 --> 00:18:45,208
We shouldn't have tried
to force you to stay.

405
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:47,419
So please! At least
hang around for a while

406
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:49,546
and listen to us play a song!

407
00:18:49,587 --> 00:18:50,380
Oh!

408
00:18:50,422 --> 00:18:52,090
You'll play a song for me?!

409
00:18:52,132 --> 00:18:54,467

Hm.

414
00:19:06,896 --> 00:19:08,148
Hm.

415
00:19:08,732 --> 00:19:10,150
Mm.

416
00:19:12,318 --> 00:19:15,030
One, two, three, four!

419
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:08,708
Hehehe...

420
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:09,959
What did you think?

421
00:20:10,001 --> 00:20:11,419
[Yui]
I don't know what to say...

422
00:20:11,461 --> 00:20:14,089
It's really hard
to put into words!

423
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:15,382
Hmhm!

424
00:20:16,383 --> 00:20:18,134
You guys aren't
very good, are you?

425
00:20:18,176 --> 00:20:19,761
[Ritsu]
<i>Talk about blunt!</i>

426
00:20:19,803 --> 00:20:22,681
But it seems like it would be
a whole lot of fun to do!

427
00:20:22,722 --> 00:20:25,934
I'm decided that I'm
going to join this club!

428
00:20:25,975 --> 00:20:27,560
(Gasps)

429
00:20:27,977 --> 00:20:29,437
Uh...

430
00:20:29,479 --> 00:20:30,063
Eh...

431
00:20:30,105 --> 00:20:31,981
(Excited)

432
00:20:32,023 --> 00:20:33,900
Banzai!

433
00:20:35,777 --> 00:20:37,696
Excuse me.

434
00:20:37,737 --> 00:20:40,990
Okay, let's commemorate the
start of the Light Music Club!

435
00:20:41,032 --> 00:20:42,784
(Giggling)

436
00:20:42,826 --> 00:20:44,160
Hey, that's my camera!

437
00:20:44,202 --> 00:20:45,829
Here we go, guys!

438
00:20:46,871 --> 00:20:48,123
[Yui]
But the problem is

439
00:20:48,164 --> 00:20:50,125
that I can't play
any instruments at all.

440
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:51,793
Can I be a manager
or something?

441
00:20:51,835 --> 00:20:54,254
[Mio]
Um... well, we aren't
a sports club.

442
00:20:54,295 --> 00:20:56,840
I know! Why don't you
take this opportunity

443
00:20:56,881 --> 00:20:58,508
to begin learning the guitar?

444
00:20:58,550 --> 00:21:01,386
But it looks really complicated!
I don't think I could.

445
00:21:01,428 --> 00:21:03,763
Don't worry about it!
Between the three of us,

446
00:21:03,805 --> 00:21:07,308
we'll teach you everything
you need to know.

447
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:08,977
Um... I guess you're right.

448
00:21:09,019 --> 00:21:10,979
Listening to you play
just now made me feel like

449
00:21:11,021 --> 00:21:14,315
I could do at least that well,
if not a lot better!

450
00:21:14,357 --> 00:21:15,358
(Mio sighs)

451
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,360
We're so glad
we could help.

452
00:21:18,570 --> 00:21:20,822
What?! You went ahead
and joined anyway?

453
00:21:20,864 --> 00:21:24,659
Um-hm! They practically
begged me to join!

454
00:21:24,701 --> 00:21:26,161
Seriously?

455
00:21:26,202 --> 00:21:28,830
Oh, as a manager
or something, right?

456
00:21:28,872 --> 00:21:31,624
When someone else says it,
it sounds insulting.

457
00:21:31,666 --> 00:21:34,669
I joined as a full-fledged
member of the band!

458
00:21:34,711 --> 00:21:37,630
And they say that they'll
teach me to play guitar!

459
00:21:37,672 --> 00:21:39,090
Huh...

460
00:21:39,132 --> 00:21:40,633
Oh, that means you're
gonna have to go out

461
00:21:40,675 --> 00:21:43,511
and buy yourself
a new guitar.

462
00:21:43,553 --> 00:21:44,596
Hmm...

463
00:21:44,637 --> 00:21:46,181
I wonder if they will
let me borrow one?

464
00:21:46,222 --> 00:21:47,682
Probably not.

465
00:21:47,724 --> 00:21:48,933
Uh...

466
00:21:48,975 --> 00:21:51,144
You can buy them for about
fifty dollars, right?

467
00:21:51,186 --> 00:21:52,354
(Nervous gulp)

with the sort of fun, pleasant
people that one so rarely meets.
