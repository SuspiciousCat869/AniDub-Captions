Yui.

00:00:05,588 --> 00:00:07,841
Oh! Hi, Nodoka!

3
00:00:07,882 --> 00:00:08,925
Wanna walk home with me?

4
00:00:08,967 --> 00:00:10,635
Oh, no, I'm sorry Nodoka.

5
00:00:10,677 --> 00:00:13,096
There's a club meeting
I have to go to today.

6
00:00:13,138 --> 00:00:15,682
Oh, really? I guess I'll
have to walk by myself.

<i>at the same time.</i>

00:00:20,937 --> 00:00:22,188
Ahh...

10
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:23,273
What's wrong, Yui?

11
00:00:23,314 --> 00:00:24,858
Mugi says
she gonna bring

12
00:00:24,899 --> 00:00:26,401
some tasty
snacks today!

13
00:00:26,443 --> 00:00:28,361
You're not going
to play guitar?

14
00:00:28,403 --> 00:00:29,195
Hm?

15
00:00:29,237 --> 00:00:30,697
Hee, hee.

16
00:00:30,739 --> 00:00:32,699

24
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:53,720

("Cagayake! Girls" plays)

26
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:29,858
Hey, everyone!

27
00:02:29,899 --> 00:02:32,777
[Yui]
<i>These three are my fellow</i>
<i>Light Music Club members.</i>

28
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:33,945
Hello.

29
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:36,114
<i>This is Mio Akiyama,</i>
<i>our bassist.</i>

30
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:38,658
(playing bass)

31
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:40,785
<i>She's tall, and pretty,</i>

32
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:43,163
<i>and gives off a real</i>
<i>"cool grown woman" vibe.</i>

33
00:02:43,204 --> 00:02:48,460
Hey, Mio, how come you decided
to take up playing bass
instead of a regular guitar?

34
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:50,503
Hmm...

35
00:02:50,545 --> 00:02:53,131
Playing guitar is...
well... embarrassing.

36
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:54,716
Embarrassing?

37
00:02:54,758 --> 00:02:57,093
Ya' know, the guitar is the
core instrument of the band,

38
00:02:57,135 --> 00:03:00,388
and because of that,
you have to play right up
in front of the group.

39
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:03,641
So the eyes of everyone
in the audience are on you.

40
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:07,395
Just thinking about being in a
position like that, makes me...

41
00:03:07,937 --> 00:03:08,980
Oh!

42
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:09,898
Mio!

43
00:03:09,939 --> 00:03:12,150
<i>Mio is kinda delicate.</i>

44
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:13,526
Mio, are you all right?

45
00:03:13,568 --> 00:03:16,696
<i>This is our</i>
<i>keyboardist,</i>
<i>Tsumugi Kotobuki.</i>

(Plays keyboard)

47
00:03:21,368 --> 00:03:22,786
<i>We call her "Mugi" for short.</i>

48
00:03:22,827 --> 00:03:25,747
<i>She's calm, soothing,</i>
<i>and really, really nice.</i>

49
00:03:25,789 --> 00:03:28,333
Ya' know, you're a terrific
keyboard player, Mugi.

50
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:30,418
I'll bet you've been
playing for a long time.

51
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:33,421
I started studying the piano
when I was only four years old.

52
00:03:33,463 --> 00:03:36,841
I've even managed to win a few
awards at some competitions.

53
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:38,802
Oh, wow! That's amazing!

54
00:03:38,843 --> 00:03:41,388
<i>Why did she join</i>
<i>the Light Music Club?</i>

55
00:03:41,429 --> 00:03:43,848
[Mugi]
All right, dig in everyone.

56
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:47,185
Oh, I almost forgot, I've been
meaning to ask you something.

57
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:50,021
This club room is really nice
and very well equipped.

58
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:53,274
Are all high schools in the
area like this nowadays?

59
00:03:53,316 --> 00:03:56,778
Oh, no, I brought all that
stuff from my house.

60
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:57,821
It's yours?!

61
00:03:57,862 --> 00:03:58,780
Yes.

62
00:03:58,822 --> 00:04:00,115
<i>Mugi is definitely</i>

63
00:04:00,156 --> 00:04:01,741
<i>one of those</i>
<i>"rich girl" types.</i>

64
00:04:01,783 --> 00:04:04,869
<i>Our drummers name is,</i>
<i>Ritsu Tainaka.</i>

(Playing drums)

66
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:12,419
<i>She's a cheerful girl</i>
<i>who's just full of energy.</i>

67
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:15,547
You really seem like someone
who would be a drummer.

68
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:16,840
What?!

69
00:04:16,881 --> 00:04:19,426
I've got a completely
legitimate reason for that!

70
00:04:19,467 --> 00:04:21,886
A powerful reason that moves
almost everybody that hears it!

71
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:24,472
What?! Tell me!
Tell me! Come on!

72
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:26,266
It's because...
Hmm...?

73
00:04:26,307 --> 00:04:28,268
Well, you know, it's...

74
00:04:28,309 --> 00:04:29,894
cause they're cool.

75
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:30,854
That's it?

76
00:04:30,895 --> 00:04:32,856
Ugh! Oh, come on!

77
00:04:32,897 --> 00:04:35,233
Just imagining having to
wriggling my fingers like crazy

78
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:37,193
just to play a guitar,
bass, or keyboard...

79
00:04:37,235 --> 00:04:39,487
...makes me wanna scream!

80
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:41,740
I really hate it!

81
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:45,744

Would you like another one?

84
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:54,336
Yes, thank you!

85
00:04:54,377 --> 00:04:57,088
So you first wanted to
join the Choir Club,

86
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:58,423
but joined ours instead?

87
00:04:58,465 --> 00:05:00,091
That's right.

88
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:02,177
You see, I wanted to pick a club
where I could make friends with

89
00:05:02,218 --> 00:05:05,472
the sort of fun, pleasant
people that one so rarely meets.

[Both]
<i>We're like rare animals to her?</i>

91
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:12,479
That reminds me, Miss Hirasawa,
have you bought your guitar yet?

92
00:05:13,271 --> 00:05:14,814
Just call me Yui.
(Gasp)

93
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:18,234
After all, I already call you by
your first name, right, Mio?

94
00:05:18,276 --> 00:05:19,986
(Nervous gasp)

95
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:25,116
Y-Yui?

Oh...

97
00:05:26,493 --> 00:05:28,286
<i>That's so cute!</i>

98
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:30,789
So what about
your guitar, Yui?
Huh?

99
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:31,831
Guitar?

100
00:05:31,873 --> 00:05:34,376
Oh, yeah, that's right!
I forgot!

101
00:05:34,417 --> 00:05:36,628
I'm supposed to play
guitar, aren't I?

102
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:39,172
Yeah, well, this is
the Light Music Club.

103
00:05:39,214 --> 00:05:40,882
Eh-hehe...

104
00:05:40,924 --> 00:05:44,052
Do you know how much a guitar's
going to cost? A lot?

105
00:05:44,886 --> 00:05:46,262
Hmm...

106
00:05:46,304 --> 00:05:48,181
Well, the cheap ones start
way down in the low hundreds,

107
00:05:48,223 --> 00:05:51,267
but believe me, you really don't
want one that's TOO cheap.

108
00:05:51,309 --> 00:05:53,311
Something around 500
should be fine.

109
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:55,855
Whoa, that much?!

110
00:05:55,897 --> 00:05:58,650
500 dollars is
ten months' allowance...

111
00:05:58,692 --> 00:06:01,986
Yeah, well, expensive guitars
can run up into the thousands.

112
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:04,030
Can I use club funds?

113
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:05,281
Nothing doing!

Mmm... Ah!

119
00:06:18,294 --> 00:06:21,423
Anyway, we can't do anything
if you don't have an instrument.

120
00:06:21,464 --> 00:06:25,343
Right, then! Let's go check out
guitars on our next day off!

What's wrong, Big Sis?

131
00:06:46,614 --> 00:06:48,908
I joined the
Light Music Club.
Really?!

132
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:51,703
So, I want to buy
a guitar I can use.

133
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:54,706
Wow, I didn't even know
you could play the guitar!

134
00:06:54,748 --> 00:06:56,207
I can't!

136
00:06:58,835 --> 00:07:00,462
So anyway,

137
00:07:00,503 --> 00:07:03,757
do you think maybe you
could lend me some money?
I'll pay you back.

138
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:07,052
I'm sorry, but I don't have
a whole lot of money either.

139
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:08,553
Yeah, I figured...

140
00:07:08,595 --> 00:07:09,971
Hey, why don't you
just ask Mom

141
00:07:10,013 --> 00:07:12,307
for an advance
on your allowance?
Huh?

142
00:07:12,349 --> 00:07:15,685
I'll even go with you
if you want me too,
to back you up.

Little Sis, I can
always count on you!

a 500 dollar advance
on my allowance.

156

I have to be real careful with
my spending from now on...

157
00:07:56,976 --> 00:08:00,063
And make sure I
don't waste money...

158
00:08:00,105 --> 00:08:02,732
I can buy this now!

Come on, Yui!

160
00:08:04,192 --> 00:08:05,902
Oh, I'm just looking!

161
00:08:05,944 --> 00:08:07,487
Uh...

162
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:10,198
{\an8}*

163
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:20,625
Boy, I'm exhausted!

164
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:22,627
I stocked up!

165
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:24,921
Wow, this was fun, wasn't it?

166
00:08:24,963 --> 00:08:27,007
So where do you guys
want to go next?

167
00:08:27,048 --> 00:08:30,176
Wait a sec...
Are we forgetting something?

168
00:08:30,218 --> 00:08:31,636
Your instrument, dummy!

169
00:08:31,678 --> 00:08:33,805
Whoa! Jeez, I forget!

170
00:08:42,897 --> 00:08:44,691
Oh, wow!

171
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,861
Look at all the guitars!

172
00:08:51,865 --> 00:08:53,867
Oh...

173
00:08:53,908 --> 00:08:54,951
Huh?

174
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:57,328
Hmm?

175
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:58,997
Hey, hey!

176
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:01,499
[Mio]
Yui! See anything that you like?

177
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:02,417
Huh?

178
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:03,877
Hmm...

179
00:09:03,918 --> 00:09:07,130
Are there guidelines or
something to choose by?

180
00:09:07,172 --> 00:09:08,340
Of course there are.

181
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:09,841
There's the tone of the guitar,

182
00:09:09,883 --> 00:09:11,760
but there's also its weight,
composition,

183
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:13,595
and the shape and
thickness of the neck.

184
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:15,889
So for girls, one with
a slender neck would be-

185
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:18,391
Ah! This guitar
here is cute!

186
00:09:18,433 --> 00:09:20,560
[Mio]
<i>She never listens...</i>

187
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:24,064
(Giggles)

188
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:30,528
That guitar costs
2,500 dollars.

189
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:31,654
Huh?

190
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:33,198
Wow, it does!

191
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:36,951
Oh, but that's way, way more
than I can afford.

192
00:09:39,954 --> 00:09:42,874
Do you have your heart
set on this one?

193
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:44,125
Uh-huh.

194
00:09:44,167 --> 00:09:45,669
Oh...

195
00:09:47,545 --> 00:09:49,297
Uh, there's some
cheap ones over there.

196
00:09:49,339 --> 00:09:51,091
Huh?

197
00:09:51,132 --> 00:09:52,634
(Sighs)

198
00:09:52,676 --> 00:09:54,928
I really want this one,
though...

199
00:09:54,969 --> 00:09:58,223
This reminds me of how badly
I wanted my current bass.

200
00:09:58,264 --> 00:10:00,266
I agonized over it.

201
00:10:04,688 --> 00:10:06,815
I-I'd like this one!

202
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:10,902
And I haggled like crazy when
I bought my used drum set.

203
00:10:10,944 --> 00:10:14,531
You can do better!
Now, try again!

204
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:16,282
You made the salesman cry.

205
00:10:16,324 --> 00:10:19,494
Yeah, well, I wasn't leaving
the store without those drums.

206
00:10:19,536 --> 00:10:21,663
Um, what is "haggling"?

207
00:10:21,705 --> 00:10:24,165
It's when you use grit
and determination

208
00:10:24,207 --> 00:10:26,751
to force someone to lower
the price on something
you really want!

209
00:10:26,793 --> 00:10:29,796
That is amazing!
It's almost admirable!

210
00:10:29,838 --> 00:10:32,674
<i>What's so admirable about it?</i>

211
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:34,300
Uh...

212
00:10:35,218 --> 00:10:37,178
Yui...

213
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:40,473
Ah! Got it!
Let's all get a temp job!

214
00:10:40,515 --> 00:10:41,850
Temp job?

215
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:43,351
Um-hm! So we can help
Yui buy her guitar!

216
00:10:43,393 --> 00:10:45,895
Huh?! No, I can't
let you do that!

217
00:10:45,937 --> 00:10:49,190
Don't sweat it, this will be
a "club activity"!

218
00:10:49,232 --> 00:10:50,608
Oh, Ritchan...

219
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:52,402
I'll try it. It could be fun.

220
00:10:52,444 --> 00:10:53,570
Mugi-chan?

221
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:56,031
All right! Let's get to it!

222
00:10:56,406 --> 00:10:57,949
Go!

223
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:00,493
Go!

224
00:11:00,535 --> 00:11:03,079
[Ritsu] Gooo!
[Mugi] Gooo!

225
00:11:03,121 --> 00:11:06,791
[Mio]
<i>What kind of job are</i>
<i>we talking about?</i>

226
00:11:12,339 --> 00:11:14,382
[Yui]
K-ON!

227
00:11:14,424 --> 00:11:15,508
[Nodoka]
A job?

228
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:17,093
Yeah, so I can buy a guitar!

229
00:11:17,135 --> 00:11:19,596
<i>When did she become</i>
<i>so self-sufficient?</i>

<i>at the same time.</i>

231
00:11:21,723 --> 00:11:24,893
The rest of the Light Music Club
has offered to help me get it.

232
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:27,020
What? You got
the others involved?

233
00:11:27,062 --> 00:11:28,355
Yeah!

(School bells)

235
00:11:29,981 --> 00:11:32,108
So, what kind of job
should we get?

236
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:34,694
We could hand out
packs of tissues?

237
00:11:34,736 --> 00:11:38,281
(Sighs)

238
00:11:38,323 --> 00:11:39,741

[Mugi]
What about a fast food job?

243
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:51,461
W-welcome, can I take
your order?!

244
00:11:51,503 --> 00:11:53,046
That's a problem.

245
00:11:53,088 --> 00:11:57,759
Oh, right. That might be kind
of a tough hurdle for you, Mio.

246
00:11:57,801 --> 00:12:01,805
I couldn't push the button
if I thought somebody scary
would answer.

247
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:04,391
I can't go and take orders!

248

[All]
"Traffic Volume Survey"?

262
00:12:39,426 --> 00:12:43,013
We have to count the number of
people and cars that pass by us.

263

We do it using a counter.

One of the prizes
is a guitar.

00:15:03,111 --> 00:15:05,405
eating this fancy
food all the time?

323
00:15:05,447 --> 00:15:06,614
[Mugi]
Oh, it's fine.

324
00:15:06,656 --> 00:15:09,075
All sorts of people give
me these all the time.

325
00:15:09,117 --> 00:15:11,828
If I left them at home,
it would only go to waste.

326
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:14,831
[Yui]
People bring your family
enough sweets to go to waste?

327
00:15:14,873 --> 00:15:17,083
What kind of family are you?!

328
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:21,171
[Ritsu]
<i>I'm counting the clouds!</i>

329
00:15:21,212 --> 00:15:23,089
[Mio]
<i>Is this an</i>
<i>occupational sickness?</i>

330
00:15:23,131 --> 00:15:25,091
[Ritsu]
That's a wrap for day one!

331
00:15:25,133 --> 00:15:27,177
Well, I'll be off for
the station, then.

332
00:15:27,218 --> 00:15:29,095
Mio and I are
going by bus.

333
00:15:29,137 --> 00:15:31,139
You said you're
walking home, right, Yui?

334
00:15:31,181 --> 00:15:32,766
Hm-mh!
Tomorrow, let's--

335
00:15:32,807 --> 00:15:35,268
Yeah! Let's eat some more
of those great sweets!

336
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:36,102
Hm?!

337
00:15:36,144 --> 00:15:37,312
I was going to say,

338
00:15:37,354 --> 00:15:39,022
"Tomorrow, let's all
work hard again."

339
00:15:39,064 --> 00:15:40,940
You better watch it.

340
00:15:40,982 --> 00:15:42,984
But if they'll just
go to waste, then...

341
00:15:43,026 --> 00:15:44,986
Watch it. Watch it.
Watch it.

342
00:15:45,028 --> 00:15:47,947
Watch it. Watch it.
Watch it. Watch it.

343
00:15:47,989 --> 00:15:50,033
It is an occupational sickness.

344
00:15:50,075 --> 00:15:51,534
Bye! See ya!

345
00:15:51,576 --> 00:15:53,411
[Ritsu] Sure.
[Mio] Bye!
[Mugi] See you tomorrow.

346
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:57,290
Oh!

347
00:16:00,168 --> 00:16:02,295
[Yui]
Hey, guys!

348
00:16:04,923 --> 00:16:06,925
Thanks for everything,
I mean it!

349
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:09,719
I promise, when I
finally get my guitar,

350
00:16:09,761 --> 00:16:12,639
I'm gonna practice every day!

351
00:16:14,015 --> 00:16:15,433
(Giggles)

352
00:16:15,475 --> 00:16:17,227
(Giggles)

353
00:16:18,144 --> 00:16:19,938
{\an8}*

354
00:16:20,522 --> 00:16:22,524
(Traffic passing)

355
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:25,110
(Clicking)

356
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:28,446
(Yawn)

357
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:30,323
(Groans)

358
00:16:30,365 --> 00:16:32,242
[Woman]
Thank you for two days
of hard work.

359
00:16:32,283 --> 00:16:35,328
Ma'am, the pleasure
was all ours!

360
00:16:36,496 --> 00:16:37,664
[Mugi]
Here.

361
00:16:39,332 --> 00:16:41,459
So, eighty dollars
per day, huh?

362
00:16:41,501 --> 00:16:44,379
Even with the 500 dollar
advance your mother gave you,

363
00:16:44,421 --> 00:16:46,589
that's still
nowhere near enough.

364
00:16:46,631 --> 00:16:49,509
Guess we'll have to work
a few more jobs, then.

365
00:16:49,551 --> 00:16:50,760
You're right, Miss Mio.

366
00:16:50,802 --> 00:16:53,096
[Mio]
Okay, guess I'll hit
the want ads again.

367
00:16:53,138 --> 00:16:54,305
[Ritsu]
Right.

368
00:16:54,347 --> 00:16:56,307
I just can't take
this money from you.

369
00:16:56,349 --> 00:16:58,768
Please, I want you to spend
the money that you earned

370
00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:00,395
on yourselves.

371
00:17:01,646 --> 00:17:03,148
But, Yui?

372
00:17:03,189 --> 00:17:05,900
I'll buy myself a guitar
all on my own.
[Ritsu] Yui...

373
00:17:05,942 --> 00:17:08,903
I want to get the guitar and
start practicing right away,

374
00:17:08,945 --> 00:17:10,447
so I can play with you guys.

375
00:17:10,488 --> 00:17:12,574
Would you mind going out
to the music store

376
00:17:12,615 --> 00:17:14,659
with me again tomorrow?

377
00:17:14,701 --> 00:17:16,161
Hm-mh!

378
00:17:16,995 --> 00:17:18,663
Thanks for everything, guys!

379
00:17:18,705 --> 00:17:20,957
I better go home now.

380
00:17:20,999 --> 00:17:21,833
See you tomorrow, Yui.

381
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:22,792
Goodbye.

382
00:17:22,834 --> 00:17:23,877
'Bye, guys!

383
00:17:23,918 --> 00:17:25,670
<i>I have to get good fast,</i>

384
00:17:25,712 --> 00:17:27,380
<i>for me and them.</i>

385
00:17:28,548 --> 00:17:30,633
Well, I'd best be
heading home, too.

386
00:17:30,675 --> 00:17:31,593
Hm-hm.

387
00:17:31,634 --> 00:17:32,510
Oh?

388
00:17:32,552 --> 00:17:33,553
Huh?

389
00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:38,224
[Ritsu]
Oh, man.
I think Yui's losing it.

390
00:17:46,274 --> 00:17:52,989
(Guitars playing in background)

391
00:17:53,031 --> 00:17:54,074
Huh?

392
00:17:54,115 --> 00:17:54,991
(Yui sighs)

393
00:17:55,033 --> 00:17:55,867
Oh!

394
00:17:55,909 --> 00:17:57,118
Eh-heh...

395
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:59,120
She really wants that badly.

396
00:17:59,162 --> 00:18:01,539
Okay! Then let's get
another job!

397
00:18:01,581 --> 00:18:03,583
Oh!

398
00:18:03,625 --> 00:18:05,001
Wait right here, okay?

399
00:18:05,043 --> 00:18:06,878
Hi, excuse me.

400
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,213
Yes?

401
00:18:09,381 --> 00:18:11,800
Would you mind terribly
if I haggled?
Huh...?

402
00:18:11,841 --> 00:18:14,469
Could you see your way to
lowering a price on a guitar?

403
00:18:14,511 --> 00:18:15,387
Uh...

404
00:18:17,013 --> 00:18:18,348
Ah!

405
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:20,767
Y-you're the company
president's daughter?!

406
00:18:20,809 --> 00:18:23,895
Ah! Uh...! Hm...!

407
00:18:23,937 --> 00:18:26,606
Perhaps...
I could go this low?

408
00:18:27,482 --> 00:18:28,692
Hm.

409
00:18:29,984 --> 00:18:32,487
No, try again!

410
00:18:32,529 --> 00:18:35,990
He says he will sell you
this guitar for 500 dollars.

411
00:18:36,032 --> 00:18:36,991
Serious?!

412
00:18:37,033 --> 00:18:38,702
What?! What did you do?!

413
00:18:38,743 --> 00:18:42,580
The thing is, this store
is in my family's
business consortium.

414
00:18:42,622 --> 00:18:43,915
(Gasps)

415
00:18:43,957 --> 00:18:45,625
Really, is that so? Wow!

416
00:18:45,667 --> 00:18:47,669
Mugi, I don't know
how to thank you!

417
00:18:47,711 --> 00:18:50,296
I'll pay you back
the rest, I promise!

418
00:19:02,142 --> 00:19:03,643
Hehehe...

419
00:19:03,685 --> 00:19:06,271
Oh, it's so cute!

420
00:19:06,312 --> 00:19:09,065
(Laughs and giggles)

421
00:19:14,988 --> 00:19:17,240
Twaaaaang!

422
00:19:18,033 --> 00:19:20,452
Oh! I look like a rocker!

423
00:19:21,036 --> 00:19:22,412
Hehe...

424
00:19:26,624 --> 00:19:29,794
Oh! I gotta practice
signing my autograph!

425
00:19:29,836 --> 00:19:30,670
(Door opens)

426
00:19:30,712 --> 00:19:31,880
Huh?

427
00:19:31,921 --> 00:19:34,466
Big Sis, could you
keep it down...

428
00:19:35,633 --> 00:19:37,927
Hey, Sis, if you
don't get up soon,

429
00:19:37,969 --> 00:19:39,220
you'll be late for school!

430
00:19:39,262 --> 00:19:41,306
Big Sister?

431
00:19:41,723 --> 00:19:43,683
Uh...?

432
00:19:44,309 --> 00:19:46,478
<i>She slept with it...</i>

433
00:19:48,897 --> 00:19:49,647
Hm!

434
00:19:49,689 --> 00:19:51,816
Oh, yeah!

435
00:19:51,858 --> 00:19:53,234
Awesome!

436
00:19:53,276 --> 00:19:55,945
Wow, that guitar looks like
it belongs on you.

437
00:19:55,987 --> 00:19:57,781
Try playing something!

438
00:19:57,822 --> 00:19:59,449
Uh...

439
00:20:03,328 --> 00:20:06,581
(Playing scales)

440
00:20:06,623 --> 00:20:07,874
(Groans)

441
00:20:07,916 --> 00:20:10,085
You really haven't practiced
at all yet, have you?

442
00:20:10,126 --> 00:20:13,171
Well, the guitar is all
bright and shiny and new
and everything,

443
00:20:13,213 --> 00:20:16,174
And I guess, I'm just a
little scared to touch it.

444
00:20:16,216 --> 00:20:18,259
Yeah, I can totally
relate to that.

445
00:20:18,301 --> 00:20:20,095
I posed in front of
the mirror with it,

446
00:20:20,136 --> 00:20:21,596
and then took a lot
of pictures of it,

447
00:20:21,638 --> 00:20:23,098
and slept all night
with it though.

448
00:20:23,139 --> 00:20:24,474
So play it.

449
00:20:24,516 --> 00:20:27,185
You haven't even taken
the film off of it yet.

450
00:20:27,644 --> 00:20:30,063
Ahh....

451
00:20:30,105 --> 00:20:31,189
HIYAAA!

452
00:20:31,231 --> 00:20:32,232
(Traumatized)

453
00:20:32,273 --> 00:20:33,608
I couldn't help myself.

454
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:35,443
Ritsu, apologize!

455
00:20:35,485 --> 00:20:37,779
I'm sorry!
I acted on impulse!

456
00:20:37,821 --> 00:20:39,614
Please, forgive me!

457
00:20:39,656 --> 00:20:41,616
Here, why don't you
have a snack.

458
00:20:41,658 --> 00:20:43,743
<i>Oh, something like that won't--</i>

459
00:20:43,785 --> 00:20:45,453
<i>It made her feel better!</i>

460
00:20:47,997 --> 00:20:49,582
No, you're right.

461
00:20:49,624 --> 00:20:51,793
The purpose of a guitar
is to be played by someone.

462
00:20:51,835 --> 00:20:55,463
And so, it's not right to just
admire it and never use it.

463
00:20:55,505 --> 00:20:56,339
Ah!

464
00:20:56,381 --> 00:20:57,590
Thanks for that, Ritsu!

465
00:20:57,632 --> 00:20:59,467
I really needed
that motivation!

466
00:20:59,509 --> 00:21:00,677
It was?!

467
00:21:00,719 --> 00:21:02,303
Well, I was kinda hoping
it would give you

468
00:21:02,345 --> 00:21:03,805
the urge to practice.

469
00:21:03,847 --> 00:21:05,849
Boy, I'm goo-- OW!

470
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:07,600
So, shall we practice, then?

471
00:21:07,642 --> 00:21:11,396
How do I get the guitar to
sound like they do in a concert?

472
00:21:11,438 --> 00:21:13,815
You've just got to
hook it up to an amp.

473
00:21:17,652 --> 00:21:18,862
Ready!

474
00:21:24,701 --> 00:21:32,083
(Loud strum)

475
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:33,960
Heh!

476
00:21:34,002 --> 00:21:36,212
That was awesome!

477
00:21:36,254 --> 00:21:37,464
It's finally started...

478
00:21:37,505 --> 00:21:40,508
We've got our
Light Music Club.

479
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:41,468
Indeed.

480
00:21:41,509 --> 00:21:44,387
All right Budokan,
here we come!

481
00:21:44,429 --> 00:21:47,015
(Crowd cheers)

482
00:21:47,057 --> 00:21:48,475
By the time we graduate!

483
00:21:48,516 --> 00:21:50,018
[Mio and Mugi]
Uh...?

484
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:55,482
(Playing scales)

485
00:21:55,523 --> 00:21:58,485
I'm sorry. That's all
I can play right now.

486
00:21:58,526 --> 00:22:00,153
I guess I should
learn a lot more

487
00:22:00,195 --> 00:22:02,655
before I try playing
with an amp.

488
00:22:02,697 --> 00:22:03,615
Ah! Be careful!

489
00:22:03,656 --> 00:22:04,240
Huh?!

490
00:22:04,282 --> 00:22:05,617
(Loud feedback)

491
00:22:06,910 --> 00:22:09,371
That's what happens when you
pull out the guitar cord

492
00:22:09,412 --> 00:22:11,373
before you turn the amp
all the way down...

493
00:22:11,414 --> 00:22:14,584
You could've said
something sooner...

494
00:22:14,626 --> 00:22:15,627
(Sighs)

495
00:22:20,298 --> 00:22:22,634
("Don't say 'lazy'" plays)

496
00:23:50,597 --> 00:23:53,058
Ah! We've got
midterm exams?!

497
00:23:53,099 --> 00:23:54,559
Is that a
chord, too?

498
00:23:54,601 --> 00:23:57,270
I don't get it, Yui.
Why didn't you study?

499
00:23:57,312 --> 00:23:59,439
Well I really had
planned to, but I...

500
00:23:59,481 --> 00:24:01,316
Come on, when you
study for a test,

501
00:24:01,358 --> 00:24:04,694
don't you ever end up fixating
on everything BUT studying?

502
00:24:06,488 --> 00:24:09,616
Oh, look at that!
It's sweet bean jelly!

503
00:24:09,657 --> 00:24:11,826
