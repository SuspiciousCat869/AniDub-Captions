1
00:00:02,585 --> 00:00:04,754
[Yui]
Guitar strings sure are scary.

2
00:00:04,796 --> 00:00:07,924
They're thin and tough, and
I'm scared I'll cut my fingers.

3
00:00:07,966 --> 00:00:09,009
You got that right!

4
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:10,218
If you're not careful,

5
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:11,428
you'll slice your
fingers to the bone

6
00:00:11,469 --> 00:00:12,971
and blood will spurt everywhere!

7
00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:14,014
(Mio screams)

8
00:00:14,055 --> 00:00:15,557
Mio, why did you scream?

9
00:00:15,598 --> 00:00:19,436
I-I can't stand
all that gory talk!

10
00:00:19,477 --> 00:00:21,438
Don't worry, Mio,
I'm fine. See?

11
00:00:21,479 --> 00:00:24,232
I'm not really bleeding.
I'm perfectly okay.

12
00:00:24,733 --> 00:00:25,817
Oh...

13
00:00:27,777 --> 00:00:28,820
Uh-hm!

14
00:00:28,862 --> 00:00:30,155
Your fingertips will toughen up

15
00:00:30,196 --> 00:00:31,156
the more you play and practice,

16
00:00:31,197 --> 00:00:32,365
so I can almost promise you

17
00:00:32,407 --> 00:00:34,534
that you won't be
doing any bleeding.

18
00:00:34,576 --> 00:00:35,994
Here. Check it out.

19
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:38,038
Oh!

20
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:39,330
Wow, Mio, you're right!

21
00:00:39,372 --> 00:00:42,125
They're all squishy!

22
00:00:42,167 --> 00:00:43,752
Squishy, squishy, squishy...

23
00:00:43,793 --> 00:00:45,211
(Giggles)

24
00:00:45,253 --> 00:00:47,630
Squishy, squishy...

25
00:00:48,381 --> 00:00:50,258
Um, are you about done?

26
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:52,719
No, let me squeeze
them some more!

27
00:00:52,761 --> 00:00:56,097
("Cagayake! Girls" plays)

28
00:02:27,564 --> 00:02:29,107
I know I'm supposed to practice,

29
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:32,277
but I have absolutely no idea
where I should even start.

30
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:33,737
Here.
Huh?

31
00:02:33,778 --> 00:02:36,990
You should start off
by learning the chords.

32
00:02:37,032 --> 00:02:38,825
Wow! Thank you!

33
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:48,960
Um, could you teach me how to
read musical notation first?

34
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:50,462
You don't even know that?!

35
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:52,672
{\an8}*

36
00:03:01,306 --> 00:03:02,474
[Mio] Bye!
[Ritsu] See ya.

37
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:04,559
[Yui]
See you tomorrow.

38
00:03:06,227 --> 00:03:07,645
Let's see...

39
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:10,940
A "C" goes like this,
and this is a "D."

40
00:03:10,982 --> 00:03:12,359
[Nodoka]
Yui!

41
00:03:13,818 --> 00:03:15,236
Nodoka!

42
00:03:15,278 --> 00:03:17,947
[Nodoka]
What's that?
A new kind of greeting?

43
00:03:17,989 --> 00:03:19,824
[Yui giggles]
The thing is,

44
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:23,328
I had them teach me a bunch of
guitar chords today!

45
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:26,122
Wow. Sounds like you're
really working hard.

46
00:03:26,164 --> 00:03:27,707
Speaking of which,

47
00:03:27,749 --> 00:03:29,751
you're heading home a lot
later than usual today.

48
00:03:29,793 --> 00:03:32,003
Mm. I spent the afternoon
in the library

49
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:33,963
studying for our midterms.

50
00:03:34,005 --> 00:03:35,882
Oh...

51
00:03:38,677 --> 00:03:41,346
Ah! We've got
midterm exams?!

52
00:03:41,388 --> 00:03:42,889
Is that a chord, too?

53
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:44,516
[Yui]
Oh, wow...

54
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:46,685
It's time for
midterms already?

55
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:49,020
And here I was set
to buckle down

56
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:50,855
and really practice
my guitar...

57
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:53,316
Oh, come on now, Yui.
It's not like you've studied

58
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:55,318
for a single test
since middle school.

59
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,611
Oh, yeah, that's right!

60
00:03:56,653 --> 00:03:58,488
Well, I guess
it's all good then!

61
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:01,533
Um, I wouldn't
exactly say that...

62
00:04:01,574 --> 00:04:03,743
{\an8}*

63
00:04:06,287 --> 00:04:10,750
(Pencils writing)

64
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:30,729
(Ritsu stretching)

65
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:33,565
We're finally free
of all those tests!

66
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:36,067
It's terrible, the way they
suddenly got harder

67
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:37,736
once we got to high school.

68
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:39,279
That's for sure.

69
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:43,450
And I... see someone who's had
an even harder time than we did.

70
00:04:44,242 --> 00:04:46,244
Your tests go that badly, Yui?

71
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:48,204
(Broken down laughter)

72
00:04:48,246 --> 00:04:50,665
Seems I'm the
only one in my class

73
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:53,043
who has to take a make-up...

74
00:04:53,084 --> 00:04:54,502
(Gasps)

75
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:56,755
E-everything will be fine!

76
00:04:56,796 --> 00:05:00,175
I'm sure it's just that you
didn't study properly this time.

77
00:05:00,216 --> 00:05:01,801
Mugi's right!
Just study real hard,

78
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:04,220
and you'll ace that
make-up test easy!

79
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:06,598
Actually, I didn't
study for it at all.

80
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:10,685
I take back my words of
encouragement, you flake!

81
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:12,437
I don't get it, Yui?
Why didn't you study?

82
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:14,606
Well I really had
planned to, but I...

83
00:05:14,647 --> 00:05:16,733
Come on, when you
study for a test,

84
00:05:16,775 --> 00:05:19,486
Don't you ever end up fixating
on everything but studying?

85
00:05:19,527 --> 00:05:21,696
Ah, I know what that's like.

86
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:23,990
Like when I gotta
clean up my room and stuff.

87
00:05:24,032 --> 00:05:26,326
I practiced on the guitar
when I was taking a break

88
00:05:26,368 --> 00:05:28,495
from studying, and I
couldn't put it down.

89
00:05:28,536 --> 00:05:31,956
In the end, I didn't get
any studying done at all.

90
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:33,625
But...

91
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:36,628
my time wasn't wasted, 'cause I
learned a whole bunch of chords!

92
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:39,172
How about applying those
powers of concentration

93
00:05:39,214 --> 00:05:40,507
to your studying, huh?

94
00:05:40,548 --> 00:05:43,218
You're a big talker.
How did you do, Ritsu?

95
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:44,552
Huh? Who, me?

96
00:05:44,594 --> 00:05:46,846
Passed with flying colors,
thank you very much!

97
00:05:46,888 --> 00:05:50,183
You know, this doesn't really
fit with your character...

98
00:05:50,225 --> 00:05:51,768
(Deep laughter)

99
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:53,812
When you're a brilliant
renaissance girl like me,

100
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:55,814
everything comes quite
easily to you!

101
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:58,066
Yeah, but I was always
under the impression

102
00:05:58,108 --> 00:05:59,526
that you were just like me!

103
00:05:59,567 --> 00:06:01,236
(Deep laughter)

104
00:06:01,277 --> 00:06:02,821
Who was it who showed up
on my doorstep

105
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:04,948
in tears the night
before the exam?

106
00:06:04,989 --> 00:06:07,492
Hey, she doesn't
need to know that!

107
00:06:08,284 --> 00:06:09,911
Now that's the Ritsu I know.

108
00:06:09,953 --> 00:06:12,122
I don't wanna hear that from
somebody who flunked a test!

109
00:06:12,163 --> 00:06:15,834
How about the two of you?
How did you do on your tests?

110
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:17,502
[Mugi]
Here.

111
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:20,964
Uh...

112
00:06:21,423 --> 00:06:22,757
Oh!

113
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:25,010
O-oh, well you know how
it goes sometimes.

114
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:27,470
I just made a bunch of
dumb mistakes, that's all.

115
00:06:27,512 --> 00:06:31,391
(Sad laughing)

116
00:06:31,433 --> 00:06:33,309
Have a heart,
please say something!

117
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:35,979
[Yui]
<i>On another day...</i>

118
00:06:37,689 --> 00:06:39,607
Thank you for your time.

119
00:06:40,316 --> 00:06:42,736
(Girls chattering)

120
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:52,746
Oh, look at that,
it's sweet bean jelly!

121
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:53,872
(Gulp)

122
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:59,085
(Gulp)
Mmm...

123
00:06:59,127 --> 00:07:01,379
(Gulp)
Mmm...

124
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:03,798
They said I'm banned
from all club activities

125
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,134
until I pass the make-up exam.

126
00:07:07,302 --> 00:07:08,386
(Gasps)

127
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:10,138
Wow, Yui, that's pretty harsh.

128
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:13,183
Well then, is it okay
for you to even be here?

129
00:07:13,224 --> 00:07:14,726
Oh sure, it's okay.

130
00:07:14,768 --> 00:07:16,728
I'm just here to eat sweets
with my good friends.

131
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:18,396
(Gulp and giggle)

132
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:21,649
All right!
Then everything is fine!

133
00:07:21,691 --> 00:07:25,070
How is this okay?!

134
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:27,072
If you're banned from
participating in clubs,

135
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:29,699
that means our club will be
back down to three members.

136
00:07:29,741 --> 00:07:32,535
Huh? No way!
Are you saying that we'll...

137
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:35,121
We won't meet the
minimum requirement.

138
00:07:35,163 --> 00:07:37,415
We'll be... disbanded?

139
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:39,376
When is your make-up test?

140
00:07:39,417 --> 00:07:40,794
One week from today.

141
00:07:40,835 --> 00:07:43,129
A week from today, huh?

142
00:07:43,171 --> 00:07:44,547
Well, with that much time,

143
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:47,509
it's okay for me to come
here every day, right?

144
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:48,593
Ah!

145
00:07:48,635 --> 00:07:50,345
That's not much time at all!

146
00:07:50,387 --> 00:07:52,681
Yui, if you don't pass
your test next week,

147
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:55,934
the Light Music Club might
very well cease to exist.

148
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:57,102
Yeah, you're right.

149
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:59,104
I want to keep doing
fun stuff with you guys,

150
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:00,855
so I'll work real hard!

151
00:08:00,897 --> 00:08:02,023
(Groans)

152
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:07,112
Okay, time to study.

153
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:09,155
Let's do this!

154
00:08:12,075 --> 00:08:15,787
How did I let this
get so messy?

155
00:08:17,414 --> 00:08:18,498
Oh.

156
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:21,001
(strumming guitar)

157
00:08:23,044 --> 00:08:23,795
Hm?

158
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:26,172
Wow, it's that late?

159
00:08:28,008 --> 00:08:30,552
I have to take a bath
and get to bed!

160
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:38,101
Meetings sure aren't as
worthwhile without Yui here.

161
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:40,478
That hasn't seemed to
affect your appetite.

162
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,188
Uh, no, Mio.

163
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:44,649
Those two things have absolutely
nothing to do with each other.

164
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:47,652
I wonder if Yui is devoting
herself to her studying?

165
00:08:47,694 --> 00:08:49,070
Oh, I'm sure she's doing fine.

166
00:08:49,112 --> 00:08:51,740
Hm, for X squared
minus Y squared,

167
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:54,159
subtract Y squared
and divided by X,

168
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:58,455
so X equals Y squared
divided by X.

169
00:08:58,496 --> 00:09:01,207
See, I can do this
if I set my mind to it!

170
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:03,043
Huh?

171
00:09:07,339 --> 00:09:09,674
This is X squared Y minus 4Y,

172
00:09:09,716 --> 00:09:11,968
so I start by
factoring out the Y,

173
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:16,222
leaving me with the sum of
X squared minus 4...

174
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:19,768
Um...

175
00:09:21,895 --> 00:09:24,314
(strumming guitar)

176
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:30,236
{\an8}Yui's studying has to be
coming along well, right?

177
00:09:31,029 --> 00:09:32,113
Hmm...

178
00:09:32,155 --> 00:09:35,116
You know, I've been
wondering that, too...

179
00:09:35,158 --> 00:09:37,327
(Giggles)

180
00:09:44,626 --> 00:09:46,586
All right, now I'm really
getting worried, guys.

181
00:09:46,628 --> 00:09:50,674
Hey, I know.
Why don't we all send her
an encouraging text tonight?

182
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:52,133
Ah! Good idea!

183
00:09:52,175 --> 00:09:54,928
I'm gonna send it
as soon as I get home.

184
00:09:57,097 --> 00:09:58,098
(Phone buzzes)

185
00:09:58,139 --> 00:09:59,349
Hm?

186
00:10:01,393 --> 00:10:03,228
Oh, hey, it's from Mio.

187
00:10:04,938 --> 00:10:06,648
Message received.

188
00:10:10,777 --> 00:10:12,654
(Phone buzzes)

189
00:10:14,114 --> 00:10:15,615
It's Mugi-chan!

190
00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:19,411
(Giggles)

191
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:22,122
Thank you so much, Mugi-chan!

192
00:10:24,124 --> 00:10:25,792
(Phone buzzes)

193
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:29,295
It's Rit-chan!

194
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:48,732
(Laughing)

195
00:10:49,274 --> 00:10:50,650
(Door opens)

196
00:10:54,821 --> 00:10:56,281
No matter how hard I try,

197
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:58,116
I just don't have
the focus that I need.

198
00:10:58,158 --> 00:11:01,286
But with this,
I'm gonna be fine!

199
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:04,873
All right, I'll use this book
to boost my concentration

200
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:07,000
for the first five minutes.

201
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:17,761
It's no use!
I just can't read this!

202
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:19,888
No, no, no!

203
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:23,183
The problem is that I always
give up before I even start!

204
00:11:23,224 --> 00:11:24,392
(Slapping face)

205
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:26,811
(Strumming guitar)

206
00:11:26,853 --> 00:11:28,897
{\an8}And that's why I need you
to help me, Mio!

207
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:31,900
You mean that you
didn't do any studying?

208
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:33,485
I couldn't do it!

209
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:34,861
Huh?!

210
00:11:34,903 --> 00:11:36,988
But, if you don't get a
passing grade, we'll...

211
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:39,783
That's the last thing
I want to have happen!

212
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:42,744
Hmm... We'll have to have
a cram session tonight.

213
00:11:42,786 --> 00:11:43,995
You mean it?

214
00:11:44,037 --> 00:11:45,789
Listen, if you have
Mio teaching you,

215
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:47,457
you gonna pass exam for sure!

216
00:11:47,499 --> 00:11:50,168
{\an8}She's really great at cramming
information in your head!

217
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:53,380
{\an8}I'll teach her
normally, darn it!

218
00:11:57,384 --> 00:11:59,344
{\an8}*

219
00:11:59,386 --> 00:12:01,846
K-ON!

220
00:12:01,888 --> 00:12:03,890
My dad had to go away
on business trip,

221
00:12:03,932 --> 00:12:05,266
and my mom decided
to go with him,

222
00:12:05,308 --> 00:12:07,352
so don't worry about
disturbing anyone.

223
00:12:07,394 --> 00:12:09,979
Hey, didn't you say that you
also had a little sister?

224
00:12:10,021 --> 00:12:13,149
Yeah, and I'm pretty sure
she'll be at home tonight.

225
00:12:13,191 --> 00:12:15,985
Well, if she's home, won't we
just be a bother to her?

226
00:12:16,027 --> 00:12:18,822
Yui's little sister, huh?

227
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:20,407
(Giggles)

228
00:12:21,533 --> 00:12:23,493
Big Sister!

229
00:12:23,535 --> 00:12:25,203
Little Sister!

230
00:12:25,245 --> 00:12:27,997
Big Sister!

231
00:12:28,039 --> 00:12:31,042
I think we'll be
pretty safe on that score!

232
00:12:32,377 --> 00:12:33,878
Come on in, everyone.

233
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,006
Thanks for having us over.

234
00:12:36,047 --> 00:12:37,674
Oh...

235
00:12:37,716 --> 00:12:39,843
Hi, welcome home, Sis.

236
00:12:39,884 --> 00:12:41,928
Oh, are these your friends?

237
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:43,680
It's a pleasure to meet you.

238
00:12:43,722 --> 00:12:45,306
I'm Yui's sister, Ui.

239
00:12:45,348 --> 00:12:48,059
Thank you for looking out
for my sister.

240
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:50,103
Uh...

241
00:12:50,687 --> 00:12:52,063
Oh...

242
00:12:54,733 --> 00:12:56,359
Here are some slippers for you.

243
00:12:56,401 --> 00:12:59,029
[girls]
<i>She's so polite and mature!</i>

244
00:12:59,696 --> 00:13:01,156
Wow...

245
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:03,575
Hard to believe two sisters
could be so different.

246
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:04,826
Different how?

247
00:13:04,868 --> 00:13:06,411
It's almost like
your little sister

248
00:13:06,453 --> 00:13:08,538
managed to get all the
good traits in the family.

249
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:09,664
What!

250
00:13:09,706 --> 00:13:11,374
(Knocking on door)

251
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:14,711
Excuse me, I brought some tea
if anyone would like some.

252
00:13:14,753 --> 00:13:18,048
And sorry, I'm afraid that
these are the only snacks
we have for you.

253
00:13:18,089 --> 00:13:21,176
<i>She really is</i>
<i>polite and mature!</i>

254
00:13:23,678 --> 00:13:25,597
So, what grade are you, Ui?

255
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:26,973
I'm in ninth grade.

256
00:13:27,015 --> 00:13:28,725
Oh, just one year behind us!

257
00:13:28,767 --> 00:13:30,310
Taken your
entrance exams?

258
00:13:30,352 --> 00:13:31,728
Just about.

259
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:33,355
Do you know which high school
you want to go to?

260
00:13:33,396 --> 00:13:36,691
Mm... I'd like to go to
Sakuragaoka if I can manage it.

261
00:13:36,733 --> 00:13:39,527
But I'm not sure if I'm a
good enough student to get in.

262
00:13:39,569 --> 00:13:42,739
Your sister managed to get in,
so I'm sure you'll do fine.

263
00:13:42,781 --> 00:13:44,657
Join us, join us!

264
00:13:44,699 --> 00:13:48,244
You just got to get your sister
to help you study, that's all.

265
00:13:48,286 --> 00:13:50,246
Yep.

266
00:13:50,288 --> 00:13:54,417
I... I'd rather do it
all by myself.

267
00:13:54,459 --> 00:13:55,669
(Laughs)

268
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:57,128
Boy, she shot you down!

269
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:59,422
Why? I can study
just as good as anybody.

270
00:13:59,464 --> 00:14:01,925
But, you know,
my sister can do anything

271
00:14:01,966 --> 00:14:05,011
once she sets her mind to it.

272
00:14:05,053 --> 00:14:08,264
[Girls]
<i>Definitely polite and mature!</i>

273
00:14:08,306 --> 00:14:09,849
All right, we don't
have a lot of time,

274
00:14:09,891 --> 00:14:11,976
so this is going
to be concentrated.

275
00:14:12,018 --> 00:14:15,355
Page 20 in the book.
This expression.

276

(Yawn)

277
00:14:20,193 --> 00:14:23,321
What do you get when you
expand it using this one?

278
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:33,957
Whee!

279
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:35,375
Here.

280
00:14:35,417 --> 00:14:37,544
[Ritsu] Oh. Manga!
[Yui] Oh, I get it.

281
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:41,631
(Laughing)

282
00:14:41,673 --> 00:14:43,133
Would you shut up!

283
00:14:47,178 --> 00:14:48,179
Huh?

284
00:14:50,181 --> 00:14:52,559
Ugh. My feet are asleep again.

285
00:14:57,939 --> 00:14:58,648
Poke.

286
00:14:58,690 --> 00:14:59,607
Ah!

(Exhales)

289
00:15:09,367 --> 00:15:12,454
It's no use! I just can't
concentrate anymore!

290
00:15:12,495 --> 00:15:14,164
Come on now, Yui,

291
00:15:14,205 --> 00:15:16,332
it's only been 30 minutes
since we started working.

292
00:15:16,374 --> 00:15:17,834
Yui, when you're done studying,

293
00:15:17,876 --> 00:15:19,252
we can all eat this cake
that I brought,

294
00:15:19,294 --> 00:15:21,880
so hang in there
a while longer, okay?

295
00:15:24,132 --> 00:15:25,675

Oh, hello, girls!

298
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:35,185
I see you're all
hard at work.

299
00:15:36,728 --> 00:15:37,729
Hm...

300
00:15:37,771 --> 00:15:39,105
Well, that didn't work.

301
00:15:39,147 --> 00:15:42,275
Yay! It's me, everybody!

302
00:15:44,486 --> 00:15:46,071
Mhm...

303
00:15:46,112 --> 00:15:47,906
I need an entrance
with more impact.

304
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:51,576
YEAHHHHHH!

305
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:55,413
Hi-yaaa!

306
00:15:55,455 --> 00:15:56,790

Attention all present! I am-

308
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:00,585
Shut up!

309
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:03,505
This is so great!

310
00:16:03,546 --> 00:16:05,882
Cake like this makes
life worth living.

do you two lead, anyway?

Oh, hi, Nodoka!

316
00:16:16,142 --> 00:16:18,103
So, are you making any progress?

317

I am, thanks for asking.

Your friends from
the Light Music Club?

Let me introduce you.

This is Mio Akiyama.

00:16:32,033 --> 00:16:33,410
Nice to meet you, too.

325
00:16:33,451 --> 00:16:35,036
My name is Nodoka Manabe.

326
00:16:35,078 --> 00:16:36,746
Yui and I have been
friends forever.

327
00:16:36,788 --> 00:16:39,290
We even ended up in the
same class in high school.

328
00:16:39,332 --> 00:16:41,960
Yeah, we've been together pretty
much since kindergarten.

329
00:16:42,002 --> 00:16:43,753
We have this
weird connection.

330
00:16:43,795 --> 00:16:45,964
Anyway, I thought you all
might get hungry,

331
00:16:46,006 --> 00:16:47,382
so I brought
you some sandwiches.

332
00:16:47,424 --> 00:16:50,010
Great timing, I was
just getting hungry!

333
00:16:50,051 --> 00:16:51,594
didn't you just finish
eating cake.

334
00:16:51,636 --> 00:16:54,556
No problem at all!
Just pass them over here!

335
00:16:54,597 --> 00:16:56,307
Thank you!

336
00:16:58,643 --> 00:17:01,062
In middle school, I came down
with a bad fever

337
00:17:01,104 --> 00:17:03,565
and had to miss classes
for a while.

338
00:17:03,606 --> 00:17:05,066
Yui came over every day

339
00:17:05,108 --> 00:17:06,985
to bring me that day's
syllabus and homework.

340
00:17:07,027 --> 00:17:09,404
I've actually never been
sick a day in my life!

341
00:17:09,446 --> 00:17:12,407
One day, she accidentally
left one of her test papers

342
00:17:12,449 --> 00:17:15,660
in the daily syllabus
that she brought over.

343
00:17:16,828 --> 00:17:17,829
Huh?

344
00:17:17,871 --> 00:17:19,289
(Laughter)

345
00:17:19,330 --> 00:17:20,957
You haven't changed one bit!

346
00:17:20,999 --> 00:17:24,044
But she really was
a huge help to me.

347
00:17:24,085 --> 00:17:25,962
(Embarrassed giggle)

348
00:17:26,004 --> 00:17:27,797
Reminds me of that time Ritsu-

349
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:29,591
Ah! No, don't tell them!

350
00:17:29,632 --> 00:17:31,009
She what? Tell us!

351
00:17:31,051 --> 00:17:34,137
You're not going to believe
this, but Ritsu actually...

352
00:17:34,179 --> 00:17:36,765
(Laughter)

353
00:17:36,806 --> 00:17:39,434
You didn't!

354
00:17:39,476 --> 00:17:42,270
By the way, are you
done studying?

355
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:45,315
All right, everything
we've covered so far

356
00:17:45,357 --> 00:17:47,108
will be on the test.

357
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:49,652
In the case of the equation
X squared minus XY

358
00:17:49,694 --> 00:17:53,656
minus six Y squared plus
two X minus Y plus one,

359
00:17:53,698 --> 00:17:55,158
you want to first simplify,

360
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:58,161
by trying to factor out
the common factor of X.

361
00:17:58,203 --> 00:18:00,538
Now, when we do that,
what we end up with is,

362
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:02,916
X squared minus
the sum of Y minus two,

363
00:18:02,957 --> 00:18:06,711
and X minus six Y squared
minus Y plus 1...

364
00:18:06,753 --> 00:18:10,006
...equals, X squared minus
the sum of Y minus two

365
00:18:10,048 --> 00:18:12,801
times the sum of
two Y plus one...

366
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:16,221
[Mio]
Wake up!

367
00:18:16,262 --> 00:18:18,848
[Mugi]
Please, get up!

368
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:20,350
[Yui]
Huh! Where am I?

369
00:18:20,392 --> 00:18:23,603
Yui, stay awake!
You'll die if you doze off!

370
00:18:24,688 --> 00:18:26,272
Ah!

371
00:18:26,314 --> 00:18:29,275
I came this close
to falling asleep!

372
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:32,153
Wait a minute!

373
00:18:32,195 --> 00:18:34,614
Commander, I don't see
Squad Member Ritsu here!

374
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:42,038
Ah! She's outside,
and she's... playing!

375
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,707
It pains me to say it,

376
00:18:43,748 --> 00:18:46,418
but there's absolutely
nothing I can do for her.

377
00:18:46,459 --> 00:18:47,544
Oh!

378
00:18:47,961 --> 00:18:50,213
No!

379
00:18:50,255 --> 00:18:52,048
[Mio]
Hey, Yui.

380
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:53,591
(Moan)

381
00:18:55,093 --> 00:18:57,345
Oh, Squad Member Ritsu!

382
00:18:58,096 --> 00:19:00,557
May fortune... smile upon you!

383
00:19:00,598 --> 00:19:02,726
Huh? Eh?

384
00:19:02,767 --> 00:19:09,566
(Yui crying)

385
00:19:09,607 --> 00:19:13,194
The sum of X minus
two Y plus four

386
00:19:13,236 --> 00:19:17,741
times the sum of
X minus Y minus one...

387
00:19:17,782 --> 00:19:19,492
Yes! I'm all done!

388
00:19:19,534 --> 00:19:22,120
Well, I think you've
got the hang of it now.

389
00:19:22,162 --> 00:19:23,747
Now you'll be able to ace
that make-up test.

390
00:19:23,788 --> 00:19:26,499
Thanks, Mio-chan, and
thank you, Mugi-chan!

391
00:19:26,541 --> 00:19:29,336
I think it's time
we called it a night.

392
00:19:29,377 --> 00:19:30,670
Hey, where's Ritsu?

393
00:19:30,712 --> 00:19:33,048
(Video game sounds)
Ah! Oh! Ah!

394
00:19:33,089 --> 00:19:35,175
Aww! I lost again!

395
00:19:35,216 --> 00:19:37,093
[Mio]
<i>She's getting was to cozy!</i>

396
00:19:37,135 --> 00:19:39,179
<i>Wait, "lost again"?</i>

397
00:19:41,765 --> 00:19:43,767
(School bell)

398
00:19:43,808 --> 00:19:46,144
Very well, begin!

399
00:19:53,109 --> 00:19:54,736
(Mugi pouring tea)

400
00:20:02,452 --> 00:20:04,287
I wonder how Yui is doing.

401
00:20:04,329 --> 00:20:06,498
Aw, I think she's
gonna be just fine.

402
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:08,667
That means you should
worry more!

403
00:20:16,758 --> 00:20:19,177
Ah, Miss Hirasawa.

404
00:20:19,219 --> 00:20:20,261
Ms. Yamanaka.

405
00:20:20,303 --> 00:20:22,555
So, how did your test go?

406
00:20:22,597 --> 00:20:24,057
(Sigh)

407
00:20:24,099 --> 00:20:25,767
It went...

408
00:20:25,809 --> 00:20:28,645
It certainly looks like
you studied hard for it.

409
00:20:28,687 --> 00:20:31,189
As long as you
don't give up,

410
00:20:31,231 --> 00:20:34,234
you're sure to
succeed eventually!

411
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:36,486
{\an8}Yui gets her results
today, right?

412
00:20:36,528 --> 00:20:39,614
I wonder if she was
able to pass this time?

413
00:20:39,656 --> 00:20:42,075
After all the studying,
I'm sure she did fine.

414
00:20:42,117 --> 00:20:44,202
(Door opens)

415
00:20:44,244 --> 00:20:46,830
(Nervous sighing)

416
00:20:48,164 --> 00:20:49,416
[Mio]
Well, how did you do?

417
00:20:49,457 --> 00:20:51,459
What am I gonna do, Mio?

418
00:20:51,501 --> 00:20:54,254
You mean you failed again?!

419
00:20:56,089 --> 00:20:57,799
I-I got a hundred!

420
00:20:57,841 --> 00:20:59,676
You got a what?!

421
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:05,306
Thank goodness.
Now all of your tests are
behind you for the time being.

422
00:21:05,348 --> 00:21:06,808
Yeah, she's right!

423
00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:08,685
I couldn't have done it
without you guys!

424
00:21:08,727 --> 00:21:09,686
Thank you so much!

425
00:21:09,728 --> 00:21:11,396
Aw, well, it was nothing!

426
00:21:11,438 --> 00:21:12,981
You didn't do a
damn thing to help!

427
00:21:13,023 --> 00:21:15,859
[Mugi]
Let's get right down to
practicing, then, shall we?

428
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:18,194
Now, you were
practicing your chords

429
00:21:18,236 --> 00:21:19,821
while you were studying,
weren't you.

430
00:21:19,863 --> 00:21:21,823
Why don't you try
playing something.

431
00:21:21,865 --> 00:21:23,658
Hehe. I have it down cold!

432
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:26,161
Ask me anything!
X, Y, whatever!

433
00:21:26,202 --> 00:21:27,579
Hmm...

434
00:21:36,504 --> 00:21:38,340
All right then, why don't you
play us a C chord,

435
00:21:38,381 --> 00:21:42,093
followed by A minor 7,
a D minor 7, and then a G7.

436
00:21:42,135 --> 00:21:44,304
Sure thing!

437
00:21:46,556 --> 00:21:48,266
What's the matter?

438
00:21:50,226 --> 00:21:51,561
I forgot how!

439
00:21:51,603 --> 00:21:52,937
Ah!

440
00:21:52,979 --> 00:21:56,524
It's all of the X and Y stuff
I've been studying.

441
00:21:56,566 --> 00:21:58,485
So you're back
to square one?!

442
00:21:58,526 --> 00:22:01,696
Um, let me see.
Was this an X?
(Strum)

443
00:22:01,738 --> 00:22:03,698
Wait, I've never seen
that chord before.

444
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:06,534
Oh, it's brand new!
See, it's like this!

445
00:22:06,576 --> 00:22:09,120
Mio, I'm positive
this is an X!

446
00:22:09,162 --> 00:22:11,748
But there's no such thing
as an X chord!

447
00:22:14,167 --> 00:22:17,504
(Plays a little tune)

448
00:22:17,545 --> 00:22:20,423
[Mio]
You can play THAT?

449
00:22:20,465 --> 00:22:22,509
("Don't say 'lazy'" plays)

450
00:23:51,681 --> 00:23:53,308
[Mio]
We're having a training camp!

451
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:54,726
[Yui]
Training camp?

452
00:23:54,768 --> 00:23:56,353
[Mio]
That's right. For one thing,

453
00:23:56,394 --> 00:23:57,687
summer vacation is almost here.

454
00:23:57,729 --> 00:23:59,397
[Ritsu]
We're going to the beach?

455
00:23:59,439 --> 00:24:00,899
Or maybe to the mountains?

456
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:02,859
[Mio]
We're not going out there
to play around!

457
00:24:02,901 --> 00:24:04,903
This will be a
band training camp!

458
00:24:04,944 --> 00:24:08,114
We'll be practicing nonstop
from sunup to sundown!

459
00:24:08,156 --> 00:24:10,075
[Mugi]
Yeah, definitely! Let's go!

460
00:24:10,116 --> 00:24:13,244
I've always dreamed of having
a sleepover with all of you.

461
00:24:13,286 --> 00:24:15,663
{\an8}*
