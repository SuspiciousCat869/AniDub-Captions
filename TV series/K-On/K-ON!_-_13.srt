Ritchan, aren't you cold?

Oh, yes!
It is most frigid, indeed!

Yes, indeed it is!

Wow, your cheeks are
really warm, Ritchan!

What's the big idea?!

I'll try playing
with my gloves on!

Oh! They're catching on
the strings!

You're bad gloves!

Wasn't it obvious?

00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:58,631
Right, Ritsu?

Mm... Uh, it's nothing!

Check it! Moustache!

00:05:16,358 --> 00:05:18,568
Ah! Ritchan, that's sneaky!

00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:20,111
I'll try, too! Moustache!

55
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:22,781
Wrong! That looks nothing
like a moustache!

I got mad at you!

You named your gloves, too?

00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:35,460
You know, I think this is
all winter's fault.

Oh, come on.
You shouldn't blame winter.

63

You know what?
I think you're right!

64
00:05:39,297 --> 00:05:42,133
There's lots of fun things for
us to do on cold winter days!

65
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:45,970
I know! Come over to my place
on Sunday for a hot pot party!

have plans that day.

[Ritsu]
Me, too.

70
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:56,606
I told my kid brother

71
00:05:56,648 --> 00:05:59,234
that I'd take him out
to the movies on Sunday.

72

And I don't think
that I'll be able to

leave the house at all
this weekend.

What about you, Mio-chan?

I can't come, either.

77
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:10,704
I want to write some
new lyrics this weekend.

Aw...

Sorry, but you and Ritsu
are always bothering me,

so I can never concentrate
when I'm here.

being insensitive.

I guess it'll just be me, Ui,
and Geeta for the party.

Try not to get your
guitar dirty, okay?

Don't forget, you just
had it worked on recently.

That won't be a problem!

I'm gonna put a bib on him
before he eats!

party in the winter.

now, huh, Ritchan?

to watch her,

but she came down with a cold
and has to stay in bed.

She's still just a kitten,

leaving her alone.

00:10:59,117 --> 00:11:01,745
"But then again,
I'd also like to see you

170
00:11:01,786 --> 00:11:04,164
with your bangs hanging down."

171
00:11:12,547 --> 00:11:14,132
Hm...

172
00:11:25,727 --> 00:11:26,978
Looks goofy...

173
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:29,189
Hey, Sis, you ready yet?!

174
00:11:30,023 --> 00:11:33,401
Uh... I'll be
right there! Geez!

175
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:38,740
Oh!

176
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:42,702
(door closes)

177
00:11:49,459 --> 00:11:51,211
Uh...

178
00:11:55,382 --> 00:11:59,052
(yawn)

179
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:05,308
(stretching)

180
00:12:08,186 --> 00:12:09,187
Uh...

181
00:12:09,229 --> 00:12:10,397
(meow)

182
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:13,316
Uh...

183
00:12:18,238 --> 00:12:19,781
(meow)

184
00:12:20,782 --> 00:12:21,866
(meow)

185
00:12:21,908 --> 00:12:25,912
You're Azu-nyan #2.

186
00:12:28,331 --> 00:12:31,251
Allow me to read
your order back to you.

187
00:12:31,292 --> 00:12:34,087
You ordered one cheeseburger
with everything

188
00:12:34,129 --> 00:12:36,840
and two medium colas,
is that right, sir?

189
00:12:38,091 --> 00:12:41,302
Don't forget to smile!

190
00:12:41,344 --> 00:12:45,682
And sir, would you be wanting
fries with that order?

191
00:12:45,724 --> 00:12:47,392
Sure, I'll take some fries, too.

192
00:12:47,434 --> 00:12:48,893
Thank you very much, sir!

193
00:12:48,935 --> 00:12:50,895
(giggles)

194
00:12:54,691 --> 00:12:56,067
Just like that.

195
00:12:56,109 --> 00:12:57,277
Right!

196
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:15,962
Right... I'll get some
killer lyrics here!

197
00:13:17,339 --> 00:13:19,132
Oh, no one's coming?

198
00:13:19,174 --> 00:13:20,383
No.

199
00:13:20,425 --> 00:13:21,551
Oh, that's too bad.

200
00:13:21,593 --> 00:13:23,094
Yeah. I know.

201
00:13:23,136 --> 00:13:25,597
Why don't we invent some
new hot pot recipes today,

202
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:28,850
for the next time
everybody comes over!

203
00:13:28,892 --> 00:13:31,061
That's awfully
forward-thinking of you, Sis!

204
00:13:31,102 --> 00:13:33,188
How about a marshmallow
soy milk hot pot

205
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:35,065
or a chocolate curry hot pot?

206
00:13:35,106 --> 00:13:38,109
Maybe we shouldn't fly too high
too fast, okay, sis?

207
00:13:38,151 --> 00:13:39,235
Huh?

208
00:13:39,277 --> 00:13:41,196
Who knows, they
might taste good!

209
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:44,741
Sis, why don't we buy some
strawberry milk today?

210
00:13:44,783 --> 00:13:47,869
Ah! Ui, you're so generous!

211
00:13:47,911 --> 00:13:49,496
(giggles)

212
00:13:58,588 --> 00:14:00,090
K-ON!

213
00:14:09,808 --> 00:14:12,560
It's cold!

214
00:14:12,602 --> 00:14:14,437
Lyrics aren't
coming to me at all.

215
00:14:14,479 --> 00:14:18,066
Maybe I should've gone to
Yui's hot pot party.

216
00:14:18,108 --> 00:14:21,486
But it sounded like everybody
else already had plans...

217
00:14:23,571 --> 00:14:26,324
I wonder what everyone's up to?

218
00:14:28,326 --> 00:14:29,619
It's freezing!

219
00:14:29,661 --> 00:14:32,914
I thought we were having a
global warming crisis!

220
00:14:32,956 --> 00:14:36,209
Dummy, it's supposed to
be cold in the winter.

221
00:14:36,251 --> 00:14:37,877
You know, you're such a wimp.

222
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:40,255
I wish the girls in your
class could see you now.

223
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:43,466
Come on, cut me
some slack, Sis...

224
00:14:43,508 --> 00:14:45,301
Oh, wait...

225
00:14:45,343 --> 00:14:46,344
What?

226
00:14:46,386 --> 00:14:47,303
Hmm...

227
00:14:47,345 --> 00:14:48,680
-Whack!
-Ah!

228
00:14:48,722 --> 00:14:50,557
Nice 'n warm!

229
00:14:50,598 --> 00:14:52,600
[Boy]
Hey, Tainaka!

230
00:14:52,642 --> 00:14:53,893
Huh?

231
00:14:53,935 --> 00:14:55,061
How's it going?

232
00:14:55,103 --> 00:14:57,188
Oh, hello.
Cold, isn't it?

233
00:14:57,230 --> 00:15:00,275
I'm on my way over to
Suzuki's house. Wanna come?

234
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:03,528
Yeah, sure!
Can I? Please, Sis?

235
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:04,821
Hmm...

236
00:15:04,863 --> 00:15:07,657
Yeah. Just don't
stay out too late.

237
00:15:07,699 --> 00:15:09,075
(laughing)

238
00:15:09,117 --> 00:15:10,827
[Boy]
See ya' later!

239
00:15:10,869 --> 00:15:12,495
[Boy]
Where did you go?

240
00:15:12,537 --> 00:15:14,039
[Satoshi]
To see a movie.

241
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,290
[Boy]
How was it?

242
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:17,417
[Satoshi]
It was pretty good, I guess.

243
00:15:20,712 --> 00:15:22,213
Uh...

244
00:15:25,675 --> 00:15:27,385
[Mugi]
Thank you for waiting, Miss!

245
00:15:27,427 --> 00:15:32,349
I'm sorry, but I ordered a hot
coffee, not a big soft drink.

246
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:33,475
Uh... Eh...

247
00:15:33,516 --> 00:15:36,227
I'm sorry,
I'll exchange it right away!

248
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:37,979
Ah! Oh!

249
00:15:38,021 --> 00:15:38,980
Oh, sorry!

250
00:15:39,022 --> 00:15:40,690
I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

251
00:15:40,732 --> 00:15:41,816
It's okay, don't worry.

252
00:15:41,858 --> 00:15:43,068
What drink did you need?

253
00:15:43,109 --> 00:15:45,320
I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

254
00:15:56,498 --> 00:15:57,707
Oh, no!

255
00:15:57,749 --> 00:15:59,376
What's the matter?

256
00:15:59,417 --> 00:16:00,043
What is it?!

257
00:16:00,085 --> 00:16:02,128
Azu-nyan #2!

258
00:16:02,754 --> 00:16:04,339
<i>Was that...</i>

259
00:16:12,514 --> 00:16:16,643
<i>Was that really...</i>
<i>a love letter?</i>

260
00:16:16,685 --> 00:16:17,602
(phone rings)

261
00:16:17,644 --> 00:16:19,062
Hm?

262
00:16:22,148 --> 00:16:23,900
<i>Maybe I should go home...</i>

263
00:16:23,942 --> 00:16:25,402
(phone rings)

264
00:16:25,443 --> 00:16:26,653
Hm?

265
00:16:29,823 --> 00:16:31,116
<i>I messed up...</i>

266
00:16:31,157 --> 00:16:34,452
<i>I thought I could do it,</i>
<i>but I messed up!</i>

267
00:16:34,494 --> 00:16:35,745
(phone rings)

268
00:16:35,787 --> 00:16:37,080
What should I do?

269
00:16:37,122 --> 00:16:38,415
What should I do?!

270
00:16:38,456 --> 00:16:39,582
(phone rings)

271
00:16:39,624 --> 00:16:40,625
Eh?

272
00:16:46,423 --> 00:16:48,591
[Yui]
Which hot pot would you
rather try,

273
00:16:48,633 --> 00:16:52,137
marshmallow soy milk
or chocolate curry?

274
00:16:53,763 --> 00:16:55,724
Huh?

275
00:16:55,765 --> 00:16:57,600
That's a hot pot?

276
00:16:58,309 --> 00:17:00,395
Strange!

277
00:17:00,437 --> 00:17:03,440
Boy that's weird,
nobody's answering...

278
00:17:03,481 --> 00:17:04,607
(phone rings)

279
00:17:04,649 --> 00:17:07,068
Oh, it's Azu-nyan!

280
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:09,612
Hello there! Azu-nyan?

281
00:17:09,654 --> 00:17:13,116
[Azusa]
<i>Please don't send out weird</i>
<i>texts at a time like this!</i>

282
00:17:13,158 --> 00:17:14,784
At a time like what?

283
00:17:14,826 --> 00:17:16,202
It's a kitten!

284
00:17:16,244 --> 00:17:19,330
It's this cat that a friend
asked me to look after!

285
00:17:19,372 --> 00:17:21,499
<i>What's wrong with it?</i>

286
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:23,084
I really have no idea,

287
00:17:23,126 --> 00:17:24,961
but something seems to
be wrong with her.

288
00:17:25,003 --> 00:17:27,547
And nobody's at home
right now...

289
00:17:27,589 --> 00:17:30,884
and I... and I...
I don't know what to do!

290
00:17:30,925 --> 00:17:35,638
Understood! Try to stay calm,
Azu-nyan, we'll be right there!

291
00:17:37,098 --> 00:17:40,185
I'm sorry, I didn't mean
to cause such a fuss.

292
00:17:44,147 --> 00:17:47,650
I'm just glad that nothing's
wrong with Azu-nyan #2.

293
00:17:47,692 --> 00:17:51,738
I had no idea that cats
threw up hairballs all the time.

294
00:17:52,989 --> 00:17:54,657
Open wide!

295
00:17:57,243 --> 00:17:59,079
For you, Azu-nyan!

296
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,206
Hmm...

297
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:09,047
I guess they might taste better
when you eat them as they are.

298
00:18:09,089 --> 00:18:10,799
Of course they do!

299
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:14,010
Oh, look! I've got texts
from the rest of the guys!

300
00:18:14,052 --> 00:18:17,180
Ah! Mugi-chan has a job?!

301
00:18:17,222 --> 00:18:20,517
Oh! Mio-chan went all the way
out to the beach!

302
00:18:20,558 --> 00:18:23,103
Ritchan wants to know
where we are.

303
00:18:23,144 --> 00:18:25,730
"We're at Azu-nyan's place."

304
00:18:27,315 --> 00:18:29,234
How can I help you?

305
00:18:29,275 --> 00:18:33,279
What a surprise! Mugi-chan
started work at a real job!

306
00:18:33,321 --> 00:18:35,699
Our Mugi sure is growing up!

307
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:36,991
Yep!

308
00:18:37,033 --> 00:18:37,909
Azusa!

309
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:39,285
Did Jun come over

310
00:18:39,327 --> 00:18:40,370
and get her cat
from you already?

311
00:18:40,412 --> 00:18:41,246
Mm-hm.

312
00:18:41,287 --> 00:18:42,664
That's really good news.

313
00:18:42,706 --> 00:18:45,500
So, I gather you spend
your day cat-sitting?

314
00:18:45,542 --> 00:18:46,376
(giggle)

315
00:18:46,418 --> 00:18:48,878
Oh, Mio-chan, welcome back!

316
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:51,881
Write anything good?

317
00:18:51,923 --> 00:18:53,508
Looks like that's a no, huh?.

318
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:55,385
But that's kinda cool, though,

319
00:18:55,427 --> 00:18:58,722
jetting off to a windswept
winter beach like that!

320
00:18:58,763 --> 00:19:00,223
You guys are so awesome!

321
00:19:00,265 --> 00:19:02,726
Don't grow up and
leave me behind, okay?

322
00:19:02,767 --> 00:19:05,603
You haven't changed at all,
right, Ritchan?

323
00:19:05,645 --> 00:19:06,896
I've too changed!

324
00:19:06,938 --> 00:19:09,315
Huh? What?
What did you change?

325
00:19:09,357 --> 00:19:11,901
Just forget about it.
It's nothing.

326
00:19:11,943 --> 00:19:14,446
Oh, that reminds me, Ritsu...

327
00:19:14,487 --> 00:19:15,655
Reminds you?

328
00:19:15,697 --> 00:19:17,407
What did you think
of those lyrics

329
00:19:17,449 --> 00:19:19,534
that I left in your mailbox?
Did you like them?

330
00:19:19,576 --> 00:19:21,119
Huh? Lyrics?

331
00:19:21,161 --> 00:19:27,042
Yeah. I tried writing them all
out on my computer this time.

332
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:30,086
Then... you were
the one who left them...

333
00:19:30,128 --> 00:19:32,130
Huh? Yeah.

334
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:33,840
Uh...

335
00:19:35,091 --> 00:19:36,634
Aaahhh!

336
00:19:36,676 --> 00:19:39,137
You wrote that stuff?!
That was you?!

337
00:19:39,179 --> 00:19:41,848
I TOLD you I was going to
leave it in your mailbox!

338
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:45,268
Don't do old fashioned stuff
like that in this day and age!

339
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:46,686
Aw, come on, Ritchan,

340
00:19:46,728 --> 00:19:49,522
let's eat our hamburgers
before they get cold.

341
00:19:49,564 --> 00:19:50,690
'Kay?

342
00:19:50,732 --> 00:19:53,735
Thank you very much
for coming miss!

343
00:19:53,777 --> 00:19:54,903
Oh...

344
00:20:11,169 --> 00:20:15,590
[Mio]
Huh?!

345
00:20:15,632 --> 00:20:17,717
Oh! Hey, what's the
matter, Mio-chan?

346
00:20:17,759 --> 00:20:20,345
Well, my bass is
still really cold,

347
00:20:20,387 --> 00:20:22,555
and when it touched
my thigh, I just...

348
00:20:22,597 --> 00:20:25,809
Oh! Do it again!
It was really cute!

349
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:27,727
Forget it.

350
00:20:28,978 --> 00:20:30,397
You never seem
to have any problems

351
00:20:30,438 --> 00:20:31,940
playing your keyboard,
do you, Mugi?

352
00:20:31,981 --> 00:20:33,400
Huh?

353
00:20:33,441 --> 00:20:35,068
Don't your hands get
numb from the cold?

354
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:37,362
Well, no,
they're just fine.

355
00:20:38,905 --> 00:20:40,490
They're so warm!

356
00:20:40,532 --> 00:20:41,908
Let me see!

357
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:43,201
Wow, you're right!

358
00:20:43,243 --> 00:20:45,620
I've always had a
high body temperature.

359
00:20:45,662 --> 00:20:46,871
You're so lucky!

360
00:20:46,913 --> 00:20:49,499
I wish we could install
one of you at our house!

361
00:20:49,541 --> 00:20:52,168
Azu-nyan, you should come
here and feel this!

362
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:54,129
Uh...

363
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:55,338
No thanks, I'll pass.

364
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:57,841
She really is warm!

365
00:20:57,882 --> 00:20:59,259
Here!

366
00:21:00,552 --> 00:21:03,221
Oh, I suppose if you insist...

367
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:07,017
Wow, you're right,
they're really warm!

368
00:21:07,058 --> 00:21:10,687
You know, your hands are
so tiny and cute, Azu-nyan!

369
00:21:10,729 --> 00:21:14,482
And I'm just a simple girl with
man hands and a cold heart...

370
00:21:14,524 --> 00:21:16,901
Ugh! Are you still
hung up on that!

371
00:21:16,943 --> 00:21:21,573
They say people with cold hands
have warm hearts, Mio-chan.

372
00:21:22,365 --> 00:21:24,242
Mugi, what are you doing?

373
00:21:24,284 --> 00:21:25,869
Uh...

374
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:29,998
Mugi-chan, your hands and
heart are both really warm!

375
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,791
Ah...

376
00:21:33,376 --> 00:21:35,170
[Yui]
This is so warm!

377
00:21:35,211 --> 00:21:37,339
Yeah, this is nice and warm...

378
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:39,090
Winter's not so bad.

379
00:21:39,132 --> 00:21:42,177
Mugi-senpai, how long do you
plan to keep working?

380
00:21:42,218 --> 00:21:44,095
At least until New Year's.

381
00:21:44,137 --> 00:21:46,014
We'll visit you
at work again, okay?

382
00:21:46,056 --> 00:21:49,351
Mio, we're never using those
lyrics you gave me, got it?

383
00:21:49,392 --> 00:21:51,186
What? Why not?!

384
00:21:51,227 --> 00:21:54,564
Hey, do you think it costs lots
of money to rent the Budokan?

385
00:21:54,606 --> 00:21:56,274
Wait a minute!
You want to rent it?!

386
00:21:56,316 --> 00:21:59,110
Well if we don't, we can't
play a big show there, right?

387
00:21:59,152 --> 00:22:01,112
It's best to have
big dreams.

388
00:22:01,154 --> 00:22:03,490
We'll stand on
that stage some day!

389
00:22:03,531 --> 00:22:06,326
[Mio]
Well, we better practice
a lot more, then.

390
00:22:06,368 --> 00:22:08,495
[Azusa]
That's right!
We have to practice!

391
00:22:08,536 --> 00:22:10,872
And we'll never play there
if we don't go pro.

392
00:22:10,914 --> 00:22:13,375
[Ritsu]
You two are hardcore
realists, aren't you?

393
00:22:13,416 --> 00:22:15,877
[Yui]
I, for one, am gonna
work hard, Ritchan!

394
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:16,920
[Mugi]
Let's work hard!

395
00:22:16,961 --> 00:22:18,755
[All]
Yeah!

396
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:22,467
("Don't say 'lazy'" plays)

397
00:23:51,181 --> 00:23:52,640
A live house?

398
00:23:52,682 --> 00:23:55,435
Yeah! Yeah! An old friend of
mine from middle school

399
00:23:55,477 --> 00:23:57,854
invited us to come
and play a show there.

400
00:23:57,896 --> 00:24:01,358
But this says here that the
show is on New Year's Eve.

401
00:24:01,399 --> 00:24:03,401
That's only ten days from now.

402
00:24:03,443 --> 00:24:05,612
But we really don't
have anything ready.

403
00:24:05,653 --> 00:24:07,447
Aw, but it sounds like fun!

404
00:24:07,489 --> 00:24:09,824
I'd really love to
give it a shot!

405
00:24:09,866 --> 00:24:11,951
Me too!

406
00:24:11,993 --> 00:24:16,831
Geeta, let's do our best
together tomorrow, okay?

407
00:24:16,873 --> 00:24:19,668
I just know this is
gonna be a lot of fun!
