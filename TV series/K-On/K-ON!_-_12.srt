Wow, you sure have thick
eyebrows, Mugi-chan!

00:00:08,925 --> 00:00:11,720
Yeah. But they're actually...

3
00:00:11,761 --> 00:00:13,346
...takuan pickles!

4
00:00:13,388 --> 00:00:14,681
Ah!

00:00:22,063 --> 00:00:23,273
Whoa! They're delicious!

Looks like your fever's
still really high.

Oh, that's right.

12

Here. Blow.

16
00:00:50,925 --> 00:00:52,510
Thanks a lot, Ui...

17
00:00:52,552 --> 00:00:54,721
I'll let the school know
that you're sick.

18
00:00:54,763 --> 00:00:57,557
I'm sorry...

19

You better hurry up,
you're gonna be late.

20
00:01:00,643 --> 00:01:02,354
Oh, there's ice cream

21
00:01:02,395 --> 00:01:03,980
and mandarin orange jelly
in the fridge.

22

Wow, you left me a feast!

hasn't come down...

No. She'll probably have to
stay home tomorrow, too.

I'd gladly trade places
with her if I could.

31

By getting her cold
to move to me.

her cold to you?

Getting sick at
a time like this

41

just shows her
lack of dedication!

42
00:03:27,332 --> 00:03:29,042
You're the one who
gave it to her!

43
00:03:29,084 --> 00:03:30,460
Oh, I did?

44
00:03:30,502 --> 00:03:33,380
Yes, you did! I mean
look at the timing of it!

45
00:03:33,421 --> 00:03:37,592
Um, she probably caught it
the other day...

46

I want you to pick your
stage outfits from these!

to make all these?

How about this waitress

What can I get for you today?

No way!

53

That's even worse!

Guys, look at this!

Hey, how about
we all wear these?

60
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:08,540
These are so cute!

Oh, they are!
They look easy to move in, too!

62

I guess these aren't so bad.

C'mon, these are great!

[Ui]
Sis was crazy about her yukata.

66
00:04:19,843 --> 00:04:21,970
So much so, that she
wore hers all day long,

67
00:04:22,012 --> 00:04:24,597
and that might be the reason
she caught a bad cold.

68
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,099
What is she, two?

69
00:04:26,141 --> 00:04:28,018
Sounds like
Yui-senpai, all right.

70
00:04:28,059 --> 00:04:31,354
Yeah, well, I gotta admit,
that at the time, I was thinking

71
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:33,898
that those outfits were
pretty awesome, too.

72
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:36,276
You know, when you think
about them rationally,

73
00:04:36,317 --> 00:04:38,445
they're actually
kind of embarrassing.

74
00:04:38,486 --> 00:04:40,655
You agree, Mio?

all the lead guitar parts
starting today?

78
00:04:45,994 --> 00:04:47,412
Uh?

79
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:50,331
You think that Yui might not
get better in time?

80
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:51,958
But I...

81
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,543
Look, it's just so we can be

82

prepared for the worst.

83
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:57,255
See you after school.

Yes, I think so.

93
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:34,626
All right then,

94
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:36,378

one more time from the top.

Sure.

That's awfully forced...

103
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:52,435
Well, I guess that means
you're feeling fine, then.

104

If you were feeling better,

105
00:05:53,895 --> 00:05:55,730
then you should've come into
school in the morning!

All of us were pretty
worried about you!

Huh? Oh, that! Um... Right!

I'm not certain, but...

best we've ever played.

Guess you're right.

I suppose we were just
thrown for a loop.

just worry too much.

and do nothing.

167
00:08:05,068 --> 00:08:06,236
(door opens)

168
00:08:06,277 --> 00:08:07,487
Hey there...

169
00:08:07,529 --> 00:08:09,948
-Serious deja vu!
-Senpai!

170
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:12,534
Sorry I made you guys
worry about me.

171
00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:14,160
Are you feeling better?

172
00:08:14,202 --> 00:08:16,162
I am! When I woke up
a little while ago,

173
00:08:16,204 --> 00:08:18,123
I was feeling a lot
better than before!

174
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:21,042
I'd hoped to get
a little practice-

175
00:08:22,127 --> 00:08:23,878
Gross!

176
00:08:25,213 --> 00:08:26,923
Honest, I'm all better!

177
00:08:26,965 --> 00:08:28,174
You liar.

178
00:08:28,216 --> 00:08:30,218
I need a tissue, too.

179
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:32,554
Ah, Geeta!

180
00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:35,140
So, that's where you've been!

181
00:08:36,266 --> 00:08:39,853
C'mere! Whoa, you're heavy!

182
00:08:40,311 --> 00:08:41,563
Oh, Sis!

183
00:08:47,569 --> 00:08:50,405
Let me make chicken soup
with them next time.

184
00:08:50,447 --> 00:08:51,698
Huh?

185
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:54,492
Hey, your fever hasn't
gone down at all!

186
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:56,578
I'm sorry...

187
00:08:57,412 --> 00:08:59,122
I guess I won't make it.

188
00:08:59,164 --> 00:09:02,375
Maybe you'd all be better off
playing without me.

189
00:09:02,417 --> 00:09:03,710
Nonsense!

190
00:09:03,752 --> 00:09:07,756
Azu-nyan, you take lead
guitar for me, okay?

191
00:09:10,342 --> 00:09:11,926
No way.

192
00:09:13,928 --> 00:09:14,971
Azusa...

193
00:09:15,013 --> 00:09:16,973
I said no. If we all
can't play together,

194
00:09:17,015 --> 00:09:19,309
I'd rather just
cancel the show!

195
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:24,647
Azusa, wait!

196
00:09:25,023 --> 00:09:26,316
Hm...

197
00:09:26,358 --> 00:09:29,861
Yui, don't come to the
club until the show.

198
00:09:29,903 --> 00:09:32,113
-Huh?
-You're kicking me out?

199
00:09:32,155 --> 00:09:33,198
No.

200
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:35,158
I'm ordering you to
stay home and rest

201
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,619
so you can completely
get over your cold.

202
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:40,246
And then we'll ALL
play the show together.

203
00:09:40,288 --> 00:09:43,708
Don't you dare give up
until then. Got it?

204
00:09:44,542 --> 00:09:46,044
Mio-chan...

205
00:09:46,086 --> 00:09:49,089
And I want you to practice,
the lead parts too, Azusa.

206
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:52,676
Not just for when Yui's gone,
but for the future of our band.

207
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:54,678
Senpai...

208
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:56,554
For now, let's do
everything we can

209
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:58,973
to get ourselves
ready for the show.

210
00:10:02,644 --> 00:10:04,312
Okay, good night.

211
00:10:04,354 --> 00:10:05,980
Good night.

212
00:10:09,776 --> 00:10:11,236
<i>I'm gonna sleep a lot.</i>

213
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:14,447
<i>I'm gonna sleep</i>
<i>as much as I can!</i>

214
00:10:14,489 --> 00:10:18,660
<i>I'm gonna get better</i>
<i>in time for the show!</i>

215
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:25,959
K-ON!

216
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:35,301
[Mugi]
Yui still isn't here...

217
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:37,804
Call her cell?

218
00:10:37,846 --> 00:10:39,431
She sent a message
saying that

219
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:41,182
she would be here
no matter what.

220
00:10:41,224 --> 00:10:43,685
But it's already 12:30.

221
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:47,063
(nervous sigh)

222
00:10:47,105 --> 00:10:48,982
[Ritsu]
Do you want to rehearse?

223
00:10:49,733 --> 00:10:51,568
The versions without Yui's part.

224
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:53,153
Hm...

225
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,989
-I guess we have to.
-No!

226
00:10:56,031 --> 00:10:57,782
Don't you see, we can't do that!

227
00:10:57,824 --> 00:10:59,034
There's no point
in practicing

228
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:01,786
if Yui-senpai
isn't here with us!

229
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:07,250
Uh!

230
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:09,627
What's the matter?

231
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:11,379
I've pushed back your
set ten minutes,

232
00:11:11,421 --> 00:11:14,966
but please be at the auditorium
at 1 PM as scheduled.

233
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:17,052
[Mio]
Understood.

234
00:11:18,053 --> 00:11:20,472
I see that all club members
are present?

235
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:22,140
Uh...

236
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:27,270
"Light Music Club: All
participants present and ready."

237
00:11:27,312 --> 00:11:28,355
Good.

238
00:11:28,396 --> 00:11:29,856
Nodoka?

239
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:35,445
One time...

240
00:11:43,912 --> 00:11:46,206
Oh no, buckets all full.

241
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:53,129
(struggles)

242
00:11:59,427 --> 00:12:00,804
Hm?

243
00:12:03,223 --> 00:12:04,349
Yui-chan?

244
00:12:04,391 --> 00:12:05,809
We'll use this.

245
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:06,851
Is that really safe?

246
00:12:06,893 --> 00:12:08,186
Ah!

247
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:09,896
[Mother]
Yui-chan, it's nice to
see you again..

248
00:12:09,938 --> 00:12:11,940
(Yui giggles)

249
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:14,359
Huh?

250
00:12:19,489 --> 00:12:20,448
Huh?

251
00:12:21,908 --> 00:12:23,326
(startled)

252
00:12:24,369 --> 00:12:25,453
Eek!

253
00:12:25,495 --> 00:12:26,788
What the heck?

254
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:28,873
She's been strange
all her life, hasn't she?

255
00:12:28,915 --> 00:12:30,917
But what's the
point of that story?

256
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:33,253
That when Yui is
focused on something,

257
00:12:33,294 --> 00:12:35,672
she loses sight of
everything else.

258
00:12:35,714 --> 00:12:38,383
I'm sure that she'll
forget about her cold.

259
00:12:38,425 --> 00:12:40,260
That's why I know she...

260
00:12:40,301 --> 00:12:41,219
Huh?

261
00:12:41,261 --> 00:12:42,804
'Sup, girls!

262
00:12:42,846 --> 00:12:44,889
Way to ruin the moment!

263
00:12:44,931 --> 00:12:46,224
More to the point,

264
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:47,559
where the heck have you
been all this time?

265
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,269
We're having a crisis here!

266
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:50,562
Well, I can assure you

267
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:52,397
that I haven't been spending
my time doing nothing.

268
00:12:52,439 --> 00:12:54,441
I factored in the
temperature outside

269
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:57,360
and made a stylish cold weather
version of those yukata!

270
00:12:57,402 --> 00:13:00,071
[All]
I wish you'd focus that
enthusiasm someplace else.

271
00:13:00,113 --> 00:13:02,532
And so, without further ado!

272
00:13:02,574 --> 00:13:03,700
Huh?

273
00:13:03,742 --> 00:13:06,828
Excuse me for being late...

274
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:08,121
Yui!

275
00:13:08,163 --> 00:13:11,374
You should have come to
the club room first!

276
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:13,293
Sorry about that.

277
00:13:14,294 --> 00:13:15,337
Azu-nyan?

278
00:13:15,378 --> 00:13:16,796
That was so mean!

279
00:13:16,838 --> 00:13:19,841
Here we were, worried
about you, and you...

280
00:13:19,883 --> 00:13:21,968
It was mean!

281
00:13:22,719 --> 00:13:24,054
You'd better make amends.

282
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:26,598
Azusa was more worried
about you than any of us.

283
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:27,932
Huh? She was?

284
00:13:27,974 --> 00:13:29,893
Azu-nyan!

285
00:13:29,934 --> 00:13:31,770
What you did was terrible!

286
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:34,272
For one thing, when you
have a cold, you...

287
00:13:34,314 --> 00:13:35,523
Glomp!

288
00:13:35,565 --> 00:13:37,609
I didn't mean to worry you.

289
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,277
Sorry, Azu-nyan.

290
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:41,279
I'll give it
everything I've got.

291
00:13:41,321 --> 00:13:44,866
Together with
all of you guys. Okay?

292
00:13:45,909 --> 00:13:48,328
We'll make this
the best show ever.

293
00:13:49,621 --> 00:13:50,830
Geez.

294
00:13:52,123 --> 00:13:53,708
Okay, just this once.

295
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:56,378
Now, come on!
Let's kiss and make up!

296
00:13:56,419 --> 00:14:01,132
Do you think that Azu-nyan
was really worried about me?

297
00:14:01,174 --> 00:14:02,592
I guess...

298
00:14:04,928 --> 00:14:07,681
All right, it's time girls.
Time to get going.

299
00:14:07,722 --> 00:14:09,224
Yeah!

300
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:11,309
Wait a sec. Where's Geeta?

301
00:14:11,351 --> 00:14:12,227
Huh?

302
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:14,104
I left him here, didn't I?

303
00:14:14,145 --> 00:14:16,398
I think Ui-chan
took it home with her!

304
00:14:16,439 --> 00:14:19,984
Sis? I'm gonna leave
your guitar right here.

305
00:14:20,026 --> 00:14:23,113
Sure... Thanks a lot, Ui...

306
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:24,906
Oh my gosh, she did!

307
00:14:24,948 --> 00:14:26,157
What do I do?!

308
00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:28,034
I guess we have no choice...

309
00:14:28,076 --> 00:14:29,661
Ms. Yamanaka?

310
00:14:29,703 --> 00:14:32,664
Here. Use this one.

311
00:14:32,706 --> 00:14:34,165
Oh...

312
00:14:34,207 --> 00:14:36,584
Do you mind playing
a different guitar?

313
00:14:36,626 --> 00:14:38,003
Uh...

314
00:14:38,044 --> 00:14:42,007
Actually, I can't play
any guitar except Geeta!

315
00:14:42,048 --> 00:14:42,882
There's a shock...

316
00:14:42,924 --> 00:14:44,300
Oh!

317
00:14:44,342 --> 00:14:45,385
(running)

318
00:14:50,223 --> 00:14:54,310
Oh! Wow, it's packed already!

319
00:14:55,478 --> 00:14:56,646
I'll just stand.

320
00:14:56,688 --> 00:14:57,939
Hi, Ui-chan?

321
00:14:57,981 --> 00:14:58,940
Huh?

322
00:14:58,982 --> 00:15:00,442
There you are!

323
00:15:02,068 --> 00:15:04,446
And now, get ready for
a performance by

324
00:15:04,487 --> 00:15:07,574
"After-school Teatime"
of the Light Music Club.

325
00:15:07,615 --> 00:15:09,576
(applause)

326
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:15,331
Oh no, where's Sis?

327
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:22,964
One, two, three!

328
00:15:23,006 --> 00:15:25,216
(playing "Ballpoint Pen")

329
00:15:48,698 --> 00:15:50,367
Found it!

330
00:15:52,786 --> 00:15:54,704
I have to hurry!

331
00:16:00,585 --> 00:16:02,587
<i>Come to think of it,</i>
<i>I ran down this road</i>

332
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:04,589
<i>the day of the</i>
<i>entrance ceremony, too.</i>

333
00:16:04,631 --> 00:16:07,801
<i>I was thinking, "I've gotta</i>
<i>do something!" as I ran.</i>

334
00:16:07,842 --> 00:16:10,095
<i>And also "What am I gonna do?"</i>

335
00:16:10,136 --> 00:16:14,140
<i>And "Is this really how</i>
<i>I'm gonna grow up?"</i>

336
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,006
<i>Listen up, me...</i>

337
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:53,304
<i>The me of that day,</i>
<i>you don't have to worry.</i>

338
00:16:56,808 --> 00:16:58,435
<i>You'll find it soon enough.</i>

339
00:16:58,476 --> 00:17:02,022
<i>You'll find something</i>
<i>that you can do.</i>

340
00:17:02,063 --> 00:17:04,524
<i>Something you can</i>
<i>lose yourself in.</i>

341
00:17:06,151 --> 00:17:07,736
<i>And a place that...</i>

342
00:17:08,653 --> 00:17:10,155
<i>A place that...</i>

343
00:17:11,781 --> 00:17:15,368
<i>A place that means more</i>
<i>than anything to you!</i>

344
00:17:22,834 --> 00:17:24,336
Big Sis!

345
00:17:24,794 --> 00:17:26,588
Oh, Ui!

346
00:17:26,629 --> 00:17:28,048
Peace!

347
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:32,052
Big Sis, you can do it!

348
00:17:32,093 --> 00:17:33,636
Yeah!

349
00:17:44,022 --> 00:17:47,650
(panting)

350
00:17:59,037 --> 00:18:03,208
Ms. Yamanaka, thanks a lot!

351
00:18:03,249 --> 00:18:06,002
All right ladies,
knock 'em dead.

352
00:18:06,044 --> 00:18:09,464
Ms. Yamanaka, you're awesome!

353
00:18:09,506 --> 00:18:12,175
I really am sorry, you guys.

354
00:18:12,217 --> 00:18:14,761
Now that I think about it...

355
00:18:15,762 --> 00:18:20,475
...I'm always causing
trouble for you...

356
00:18:20,517 --> 00:18:24,771
...And it's always at
important times like this!

357
00:18:25,939 --> 00:18:27,524
You should at least
tie your tie.

358
00:18:27,565 --> 00:18:30,735
We all think you're
the greatest, Yui.

359
00:18:30,777 --> 00:18:32,195
(applause)

360
00:18:32,237 --> 00:18:34,406
You can do it, Yui!

361
00:18:35,782 --> 00:18:37,450
Go get 'em, Yui!

362
00:18:38,827 --> 00:18:42,914
Um, once again, we're
After-school Teatime.

363
00:18:42,956 --> 00:18:44,499
I'm sorry to all of you,

364
00:18:44,541 --> 00:18:47,877
I was so late today because
I left my guitar at home.

365
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:50,672
Sorry I forgot you, Geeta.

366
00:18:50,714 --> 00:18:52,090
That's why?!

367
00:18:52,132 --> 00:18:54,509
When we started the
Light Music Club we said,

368
00:18:54,551 --> 00:18:57,595
that our slogan was going to
be "Budokan or bust!"

369
00:18:57,637 --> 00:18:59,389
We worked after-school
jobs together

370
00:18:59,431 --> 00:19:00,557
so I could buy Geeta.

371
00:19:00,598 --> 00:19:02,225
We had tea in
the club room together

372
00:19:02,267 --> 00:19:03,810
and talked about everything.

373
00:19:03,852 --> 00:19:06,604
We had training camps at
Mugi-chan's summer homes,

374
00:19:06,646 --> 00:19:09,691
and looked for a new student
who would join the club.

375
00:19:09,733 --> 00:19:12,360
I can't really say that we
devoted ourselves

376
00:19:12,402 --> 00:19:14,320
wholeheartedly to practicing,

377
00:19:14,362 --> 00:19:17,949
but right now, for us standing
here on this stage,

378
00:19:17,991 --> 00:19:20,744
this auditorium is our Budokan!

379
00:19:20,785 --> 00:19:21,953
(cheers)

380
00:19:21,995 --> 00:19:24,539
And we'll sing our hearts out
to the very end!

381
00:19:28,209 --> 00:19:29,878
Fuwa Fuwa Time, guys!

382
00:19:31,421 --> 00:19:33,631
(playing "Fuwa Fuwa Time")

383
00:21:30,874 --> 00:21:32,417
One more time!

384
00:22:07,285 --> 00:22:09,746
I love light music!

385
00:22:10,622 --> 00:22:12,374
Ritchan, let's do another one!

386
00:22:12,415 --> 00:22:13,625
You got it!

387
00:22:13,667 --> 00:22:14,417
Yui!

388
00:22:14,459 --> 00:22:15,710
Nodoka-chan!

389
00:22:15,752 --> 00:22:17,170
Your time is up!

390
00:22:17,212 --> 00:22:19,547
What?!

391
00:22:19,589 --> 00:22:21,508
("Don't say 'lazy'" plays)

392
00:23:49,471 --> 00:23:51,639
How about a marshmallow
soy milk hot pot

393
00:23:51,681 --> 00:23:53,767
or a chocolate curry hot pot?

394
00:23:57,228 --> 00:23:58,897
Let's see...

395
00:24:01,066 --> 00:24:02,567
Hmm...

396
00:24:05,695 --> 00:24:08,698
Uh... It's nothing!

397
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:10,200
Check it! Moustache!

398
00:24:10,241 --> 00:24:12,535
I have to bow out today.

399
00:24:12,577 --> 00:24:14,204
Do you have plans?

400
00:24:14,245 --> 00:24:16,081
Yes, sort of...

401
00:24:16,122 --> 00:24:17,582
Bye!
