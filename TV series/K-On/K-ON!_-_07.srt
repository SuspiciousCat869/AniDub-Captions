[Young Yui]
Okay... A little further...

2
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:13,638
[Young Ui]
S-sis, are you sure
that you can do this?

3
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:16,474
I can do it!

4
00:00:16,516 --> 00:00:19,227
(struggling)

5
00:00:19,853 --> 00:00:21,730
Uh...

6
00:00:22,897 --> 00:00:24,816
All done!

7
00:00:28,528 --> 00:00:32,741
Gee, I wonder if Santa's
gonna come this year?

8
00:00:32,782 --> 00:00:34,409
I forget to do my homework,

9
00:00:34,451 --> 00:00:36,453
and wouldn't finish
my lunch sometimes.

10
00:00:36,494 --> 00:00:38,455
And I haven't been very good,

11
00:00:38,496 --> 00:00:41,708
so I'm afraid
maybe he won't come.

12
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:43,209
May I get presents!

13
00:00:43,251 --> 00:00:45,545
Oh, it'll be okay, Sis!
I know it!

14
00:00:45,587 --> 00:00:48,048
Santa will bring you lots
and lots of presents.

15
00:00:48,089 --> 00:00:49,382
You'll see.

16
00:00:49,424 --> 00:00:52,135
I think you should try
making a wish, too, Ui!

17
00:00:53,803 --> 00:00:55,180
Hm...

18
00:00:55,221 --> 00:00:59,225
May there be a
White Christmas this year.

19
00:00:59,267 --> 00:01:01,686
Um, what's a
White Christmas?

20
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:04,189
It's a Christmas morning
where snow has fallen

21
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:06,733
and made everything
really pretty and white!

22
00:01:06,775 --> 00:01:08,151
Oh!

23
00:01:17,619 --> 00:01:19,579
Ui! Ui!

24
00:01:19,621 --> 00:01:20,872
Hurry, hurry!

25
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:22,832
Sis, wait up!

26
00:01:24,793 --> 00:01:26,086
(giggles)

27
00:01:26,127 --> 00:01:27,629
Ta-dah!

28
00:01:28,963 --> 00:01:30,590
Huh?

29
00:01:35,178 --> 00:01:37,639
It's a White Christmas!

30
00:01:39,683 --> 00:01:41,810
Uh? Huh?

31
00:01:51,236 --> 00:01:52,946
Big Sis, what is this?

32
00:01:52,987 --> 00:01:55,198
(giggles)

33
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,741
It's stuffing from a cushion!

34
00:01:56,783 --> 00:01:58,326
Uh!

35
00:01:58,743 --> 00:01:59,619
Uhh...

36
00:01:59,661 --> 00:02:01,037

00:02:11,172 --> 00:02:12,382
Uh?

00:02:12,424 --> 00:02:14,843
Ui? What's so funny?

(giggles)

42
00:02:18,179 --> 00:02:19,389
I really hope we'll have

43
00:02:19,431 --> 00:02:22,350
another fun Christmas
together this year.

("Cagayake! Girls" plays)

45
00:03:59,197 --> 00:04:00,824
It sure has gotten cold.

00:04:00,865 --> 00:04:02,575
Brr...

47
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:06,579
Ui, shouldn't you be
wearing your scarf?

48
00:04:06,621 --> 00:04:08,707
Um-hm, but I guess it blew away

49
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:11,793
when I washed it and
hung it out to dry last year.

50
00:04:11,835 --> 00:04:13,211

00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:17,924
Oh!

53
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:19,426
Hm...

54
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:32,439
Thank you, Big Sis...

55
00:04:33,732 --> 00:04:35,525
Nice 'n warm, nice 'n warm...

56
00:04:35,567 --> 00:04:37,569
Hey, what happened to
your other mitten?

57
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:40,321
Oh, I lost it somewhere.

58

Check it out!

62
00:04:58,673 --> 00:05:01,593
I made a flyer for
our Christmas party!

63
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:05,096
[Mio]
Huh? We decided that we're
gonna have a Christmas party?

64
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:07,140
I did! But I didn't
tell anyone.

65
00:05:07,182 --> 00:05:08,641
You should have!

66
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:12,270
The date: December 24th,
Christmas Eve.

67
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:14,022
The place: Mugi's house.

68
00:05:14,064 --> 00:05:16,691
Cover charge: Ten dollars.
Huh?

69
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:19,694
Sorry, that really isn't
a good day for our house.

70
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:21,946
Yeah, I was kind of
afraid of that.

71
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:25,241
The schedule at our house is
always packed this time of year.

72
00:05:25,283 --> 00:05:26,534
You have to make arrangements

73
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:28,453
at least a full month
in advance.

74
00:05:28,495 --> 00:05:30,246
I'm truly sorry!

75
00:05:30,288 --> 00:05:32,123
R-really, you don't say.

Ritsu, what about your house?

78
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:37,253
No. No, forget that.

79
00:05:37,295 --> 00:05:38,630
Ritsu's place is so messy

80
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:40,382
there's nowhere
for you to stand.

81

Excuse me?!

83
00:05:45,512 --> 00:05:47,013
You're one to talk,

84
00:05:47,055 --> 00:05:49,516
your room has dirty clothes
tossed everywhere.

85
00:05:49,557 --> 00:05:50,975
Even panties.

86
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:53,269
Aah!

87
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:55,730
Hey! Don't make up
garbage about me!

88
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:58,400

pictures as proof.

00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:09,119
Aah!

00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,871
Stop it! Please, stop it!

96
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:15,041
Hey, Yui, how about your house?

97
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:17,085
I don't see why not.

98
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:19,546
Yeah! Score!

99
00:06:19,587 --> 00:06:21,548
But are you sure it will
be okay for a big group

100
00:06:21,589 --> 00:06:23,174
to come over on Christmas Eve?

101
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:25,260
Hm-hm. Mom and Dad are
both going to be away

102
00:06:25,301 --> 00:06:27,012
on vacation that day.

103
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:29,389
Hey, they were gone when we
where there last time, too.

104
00:06:29,431 --> 00:06:31,683
Yeah, they like to
travel a lot together.

105
00:06:31,725 --> 00:06:33,935
They said they're going
to Germany this year.

106
00:06:33,977 --> 00:06:34,936
Oh!

<i>What a lovey-dovey couple!</i>

110
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:42,277
Is there anything that
the three of us can bring?

111
00:06:42,318 --> 00:06:44,195
Just leave all the food to me!

112
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:46,156
Are you sure about that?

113
00:06:46,197 --> 00:06:47,866
Yeah! No problem!

114
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:49,868
'Cause Ui will be
making it all.

Good thing she has
such a mature sister...

Oh, that's right!

117
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:55,498
There's one more thing!

118
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:57,125
Let's have a present exchange!

119
00:06:57,167 --> 00:06:58,543
Yeah, let's do it!

120
00:06:58,585 --> 00:06:59,878
Great idea!

121
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:02,339
Don't bring anything
weird, Mio, okay.

122

Huh?! That's what you do!

123
00:07:04,299 --> 00:07:06,343
Like that time back in
grade school...

(giggles)

132
00:07:22,359 --> 00:07:23,735
Do you want to come to
the Light Music Club

133
00:07:23,777 --> 00:07:25,070
Christmas party, Nodoka?

134
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:28,490
Uh, are you sure?
I'm not a club member.

135
00:07:28,531 --> 00:07:29,866
Don't worry, it's fine!

136
00:07:29,908 --> 00:07:33,745
I mean, we're all
friends here, after all.

137
00:07:33,787 --> 00:07:35,330
The more people that
come to the party,

138
00:07:35,372 --> 00:07:36,664
the more money
we'll have to spend.

139
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:39,250
What are you planning
on doing with it?

140
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:41,252
Can you come, Nodoka-chan?

141
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:42,128
Yup.

142
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:43,630
Yay!

143
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:45,715
So that's the whole deal.

I hope we can count on you.

145
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:48,927
Of course, I'll be
chipping in to help out.

146
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:51,304
Just leave everything to me!

147
00:07:51,346 --> 00:07:52,430
But...

148
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:54,057

00:07:56,976 --> 00:07:59,562
I'd like you to handle
the decorations, please.

151
00:07:59,604 --> 00:08:01,731
Roger that, ma'am!

152
00:08:01,773 --> 00:08:05,527
What are you gonna do at
your Christmas party, anyway?

153
00:08:05,568 --> 00:08:07,112
Eat cake, trade presents,

154
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:09,781
you know, all that
Christmassy kind of stuff.

Oh!

156
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:14,369
Also each of us will
do a party trick!

157
00:08:14,411 --> 00:08:15,870
Huh?

158
00:08:18,832 --> 00:08:19,624

Party tricks, huh?

160
00:08:20,834 --> 00:08:23,795
I wonder what should I do?

161
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:26,464
Oh, wow, you're really
giving it a lot of thought.

162
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:29,134
Don't worry, I'm sure
I'll think of something!

163
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:30,635
Uh... Hm-mm!

164
00:08:30,677 --> 00:08:32,679
And I'm gonna have to go out
and get a present, too!

165
00:08:32,721 --> 00:08:36,558
Oh, you're right,
I'll have to go buy one, too!

00:08:42,313 --> 00:08:43,815
This is so cute!

169
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:46,192
Oh, Nodoka-chan, I really,
really want this!

170
00:08:46,234 --> 00:08:48,403
You know, normally,
you have to go again

171
00:08:48,445 --> 00:08:50,071
if you draw your own name.

172
00:08:50,113 --> 00:08:51,406
Aw...

173
00:08:51,448 --> 00:08:52,991
(sad groan)

174
00:08:56,327 --> 00:08:57,662
Guess I'll go with this, then.

175
00:08:57,704 --> 00:08:59,581
[Nodoka]
Uh...

176
00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:05,420
Ritsu, made up your mind yet?

177
00:09:05,462 --> 00:09:08,256
How's this?

178
00:09:08,298 --> 00:09:10,091
Ah!

179
00:09:10,133 --> 00:09:11,843
A-absolutely not!

180
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:14,220
How about this, then?

181
00:09:14,262 --> 00:09:16,056
(scream)

182
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:19,017
Or how about thi-- Ow!

183
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:21,603
Why do you always try
to get stuff like that?!

184
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:24,689
Yes! I finally decided!

185
00:09:24,731 --> 00:09:26,691
Oh, hey, you guys!

186
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:30,362
You came to do a little
gift shopping, too, huh?

187
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:31,946
So, what did you buy?

188
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:35,075
Well, if we told you that,
it would spoil all the fun.

189
00:09:35,116 --> 00:09:36,493
Guess you're right.

190
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:38,370
Oh, hey! Ta-dah!

191
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:41,581
We're on our way over
to the raffle drawing!

192
00:09:41,623 --> 00:09:44,084
Huh, really? So are we!

193
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:46,252
Come to Mama!

194
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:48,672
I won more tissues?

195
00:09:48,713 --> 00:09:51,216
We have a winner! Our top prize!

196
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:54,219
Here you go! Congratulations!

197
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:55,845
Mugi-chan?

198
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:58,556
Oh!

199
00:09:58,598 --> 00:09:59,891
You're all out shopping, too?

200
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:01,476
Did you just win?!

201
00:10:01,518 --> 00:10:03,144
Uh-hm, a trip to Hawaii,
I think.

202
00:10:03,186 --> 00:10:05,563
[Mio]
<i>What is it with her</i>
<i>amazing luck?!</i>

203
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:07,065
But I turned
the prize down.

204
00:10:07,107 --> 00:10:08,483
Why?!

205
00:10:08,525 --> 00:10:09,818
I wanted this instead,

206
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:11,361
so I asked them to exchange it.

207
00:10:11,403 --> 00:10:14,155
We should all play it
together on Christmas!

208
00:10:14,197 --> 00:10:15,824
Uh-hm...

209
00:10:17,826 --> 00:10:20,203
Now then, what should I make?

210
00:10:22,247 --> 00:10:23,581
Hmm...

211
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:26,292
And what trick should I do?

212
00:10:33,967 --> 00:10:35,677
K-ON!

213
00:10:44,436 --> 00:10:46,771
(loud pop)
Ah!

214
00:10:46,813 --> 00:10:48,732
Big Sis! What happened here?

215
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:51,109
Oh, Ui...

216
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:57,365
I thought you were
cleaning the place up.

217
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:59,284
I couldn't help myself.

218
00:11:00,368 --> 00:11:02,787
Oh! Ooo...

219
00:11:03,413 --> 00:11:04,748
Those look delicious!

220
00:11:04,789 --> 00:11:06,916
(Yui giggles)

221
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:07,959
Huh?

222
00:11:08,001 --> 00:11:10,086
Hey, don't eat those, Big Sis!

223
00:11:10,128 --> 00:11:13,214
Don't worry, I won't
sneak any bites!

224
00:11:13,256 --> 00:11:14,424
Hehehe...

225
00:11:14,466 --> 00:11:15,759
Huh?

226
00:11:17,635 --> 00:11:18,595
Hm?

227
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:20,847
I said I wouldn't!

228
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:23,641
Huh?

229
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:24,809
It's like we're playing

230
00:11:24,851 --> 00:11:27,228
Red Light, Green Light
or something?!

231
00:11:28,855 --> 00:11:31,274
Come on, Sis,
stop fooling around.

232
00:11:31,316 --> 00:11:32,942
Hehehe...

233
00:11:32,984 --> 00:11:35,362
You haven't done any
decorating at all yet,

234
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:37,072
so you'd better hurry.

235
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:41,618
Snip, snip!

236
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:43,578
You mean, you're just
getting started?!

237
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:45,288
(door bell)

238
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:48,166
Merry Christmas!

239
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:49,334
Come in!

240
00:11:49,376 --> 00:11:52,879
Hey-o! Yui, we're here!

241
00:11:52,921 --> 00:11:56,299
Hey, everybody!
Come on in!

242
00:11:56,341 --> 00:11:57,926
What're you doing?

243
00:11:57,967 --> 00:12:01,513
I couldn't bring myself to
stop, once I got started.

244
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:03,515
What are you,
a grade schooler?

245
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:05,642
Oh, here, let me
take your coats.

246
00:12:05,684 --> 00:12:07,602
Oh, right.
Thanks a lot, Ui.

247
00:12:07,644 --> 00:12:09,646
[Mio]
<i>A hardworking little sister</i>

248
00:12:09,688 --> 00:12:11,398
<i>and a goofball big sister...</i>

249
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:15,026
<i>It's the perfect setup</i>
<i>for a sad soap opera.</i>

250
00:12:15,944 --> 00:12:18,154
[Ritsu]
Wow, this food is amazing!

251
00:12:18,196 --> 00:12:20,532
[Mugi]
You made all this, Ui-chan?

252
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:22,909
[Yui]
Don't be rude! I made some, too!

253
00:12:22,951 --> 00:12:24,494
Look at this cake!

254
00:12:24,536 --> 00:12:25,745
That's awesome!

255
00:12:25,787 --> 00:12:27,372
I put all the
strawberries on top!

256
00:12:27,414 --> 00:12:30,125
Hey, return the "awesome,"
I just said!

257
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:31,126
Not right?

258
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:33,461
Um, well, Big Sis
worked really hard

259
00:12:33,503 --> 00:12:35,005
on all sorts of things today.

260
00:12:35,046 --> 00:12:37,257
For instance, she tried to
clean the house

261
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:39,009
and tried to put up
the decorations.

262
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:41,970
And she also... um...

263
00:12:42,012 --> 00:12:44,889
[Mio]
<i>She's really trying to</i>
<i>stand up for her!</i>

264
00:12:45,682 --> 00:12:47,142
We get it. We're sorry.

265
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:49,728
Nodoka-chan says that
she's gonna be late,

266
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:52,063
so let's go ahead
and have a toast.

267
00:12:52,105 --> 00:12:52,856
Hm-hm.

268
00:12:52,897 --> 00:12:54,107
The airheaded older sister

269
00:12:54,149 --> 00:12:55,942
and the admirable
little sister...

270
00:12:55,984 --> 00:12:59,154
I suppose that's gotta make
for a pretty good team.

271
00:12:59,696 --> 00:13:01,031
Cheers!

272
00:13:01,072 --> 00:13:03,950
Oh, wow, that's yet
another year done and gone!

273
00:13:03,992 --> 00:13:06,327
Sheesh, you sound like
an old man.

274
00:13:06,369 --> 00:13:07,328
Oh!

275
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:09,205
Ah! Ms. Yamanaka?!

276
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:12,667
These are delicious.
Can I have another helping?

277
00:13:12,709 --> 00:13:14,085
When did she get here?!

278
00:13:14,127 --> 00:13:17,172
[Ritsu]
Don't tell me she
climbed in with a rope!

279
00:13:17,547 --> 00:13:18,631
Ha!

280
00:13:18,673 --> 00:13:19,883
[Mio]
And then she snuck in...

281
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:21,176
[Yui]
...through an open window?!

282
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:25,096
Now really, who do you
think I am anyway?

283
00:13:25,138 --> 00:13:26,890
Honestly, what sort of club

284
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:28,892
forgets to invite
their faculty advisor?

285
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:32,228
Um, well, "forget" isn't
exactly what I'd call it...

286
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:34,230
We didn't ask you
because we assumed

287
00:13:34,272 --> 00:13:36,399
you had plans with
your boyfriend.

288
00:13:36,441 --> 00:13:37,776
Wha-!

289
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:40,820
How dare you say that!
How dare you say that!

290
00:13:40,862 --> 00:13:43,156
Clueless types are scary.

291
00:13:43,198 --> 00:13:46,076
For your punishment, I want
you to change into this, Yui.

292
00:13:46,117 --> 00:13:49,412
Why in the world would you bring
something like that with you?

293
00:13:49,454 --> 00:13:50,288
Hehe!

294
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:52,248
Ta-dah!

295
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:53,500
Not working.

296
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:56,586
You're just not feeling
quite enough shame.

297
00:13:56,628 --> 00:13:58,713
Yes, this calls for...

298
00:13:58,755 --> 00:13:59,798
Ah!

299

There's no escape!

I'm sorry.
I have the wrong house.

It's the right house!
Help me!

310

want to marry me now...

00:22:04,783 --> 00:22:06,910
May I become more
proficient at the guitar.

494
00:22:06,951 --> 00:22:08,328
Right!

495
00:22:11,414 --> 00:22:13,541

Want to grab something
to eat on the way home?

496
00:22:13,583 --> 00:22:15,710
[Mugi]
Please don't talk about food!

497
00:22:15,752 --> 00:22:18,880
[Mio]
You really never gain
any weight, Yui?

We're the Light Music Club...

500
00:23:53,308 --> 00:23:56,728
If you ever get lonely,
come over to visit
whenever you want!

501
00:23:56,770 --> 00:23:58,396
What am I,
a grade schooler?

502
00:23:58,438 --> 00:24:00,648
Welcome to our club room!

503
00:24:00,690 --> 00:24:02,567
Come in, come in,
it's so good to see you!

504
00:24:02,609 --> 00:24:03,860
Welcome to our club!

505
00:24:03,902 --> 00:24:08,490
Um... First, could you
explain what that was?

506
00:24:09,032 --> 00:24:10,158
You two...

507
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,826
Ui!

508
00:24:11,868 --> 00:24:14,454
In any event, we'll be
performing four songs tomorrow,

509
00:24:14,496 --> 00:24:16,122
so be sure to come.

510
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:18,708
I'm lonely...
