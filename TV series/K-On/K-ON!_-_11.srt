1
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:06,673
[Azusa]
<i>I never suspected that</i>
<i>the Light Music Club</i>

2
00:00:06,715 --> 00:00:10,135
<i>would face a crisis of</i>
<i>these proportions</i>

3
00:00:10,176 --> 00:00:13,471
<i>so soon before</i>
<i>the School Festival.</i>

4
00:00:14,806 --> 00:00:16,099
(Azusa humming)

5
00:00:16,141 --> 00:00:18,560
[Ritsu]
You sure are in
a good mood, Azusa.

6
00:00:18,601 --> 00:00:19,728
Huh?

7
00:00:20,729 --> 00:00:22,022
I get happy when I think about

8
00:00:22,063 --> 00:00:24,733
actually playing a
live show at the festival.

9
00:00:24,774 --> 00:00:26,609
Aw. That's really cute!

10
00:00:26,651 --> 00:00:29,696
I wish I could have seen you
play at last year's festival.

11
00:00:29,738 --> 00:00:31,114
(Mio spits)

12
00:00:31,156 --> 00:00:33,950
Yeah. Guess you put on
a pretty big show last year,

13
00:00:33,992 --> 00:00:35,869
-didn't you, Mio?
-Huh?

14
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:38,371
She tripped while she was
up on stage, and-

15
00:00:38,413 --> 00:00:39,664
Ah!

16
00:00:39,706 --> 00:00:41,708
[Yamanaka]
Hey! I just happen to
have a recording

17
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:42,959
of their last year's show.

18
00:00:43,001 --> 00:00:45,295
Ah! I wanna see!
I wanna see!

19
00:00:45,337 --> 00:00:47,672
Are you sure you won't
reconsider, Azusa?

20
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:50,050
Yui, Ritsu...
(snap)

21
00:00:50,091 --> 00:00:51,551
Wait! No! Let me go!

22
00:00:51,593 --> 00:00:53,845
Now, let's start with
the primo scene.

23
00:00:53,887 --> 00:00:55,388
[Mio]
Don't look, Azusa!

24
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:58,141
It's too dangerous!
You'll be cursed!

25
00:00:59,017 --> 00:01:00,894
I can't unsee it.

26
00:01:00,935 --> 00:01:02,729
I was too late...

27
00:01:03,772 --> 00:01:06,107
("Cagayake! Girls" plays)

28
00:02:40,368 --> 00:02:41,995
(music playing)

29
00:02:42,037 --> 00:02:43,288
[Azusa]
It's pretty weird.

30
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:45,373
You guys seem to only play
incredibly well

31
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:46,791
during live performances.

32
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:49,586
Oh, look at you, offering up
opinions and everything!

33
00:02:49,627 --> 00:02:52,672
Head lock!
Noogie! Noogie!

34
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:54,257
(Yui giggles)

35
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:55,800
What is it, Yui?

36
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:59,512
This is bringing back
a lot of fun memories.

37
00:02:59,554 --> 00:03:01,598
As I recall,
you blew out your voice

38
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:03,475
just before we did this show.

39
00:03:03,516 --> 00:03:06,936
Yeah! My voice was all scratchy
when I woke up that morning.

40
00:03:06,978 --> 00:03:09,856
That's right!
So Mio took over vocals...

41
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:11,358
This will be your first show

42
00:03:11,399 --> 00:03:13,651
as member of
the Light Music Club.

43
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:14,736
Yeah!

44
00:03:14,778 --> 00:03:16,821
I'm gonna give it
all I've got!

45
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:19,574
[Nodoka]
I'm sorry to interrupt when
you're having such a good time.

46
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:22,160
Oh, Nodoka!
What's going on?

47
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:24,579
Don't act like you don't know.

48
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:25,663
This.

49
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:27,749
[Ritsu]
Auditorium Use Application...

50
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:30,752
[Nodoka]
Right. You haven't submitted one
for the School Festival.

51
00:03:30,794 --> 00:03:32,837
Oh, I completely forgot.

52
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,339
Don't be so nonchalant!

53
00:03:34,381 --> 00:03:37,133
Things have been kinda hectic,
so it slipped my mind.

54
00:03:37,175 --> 00:03:38,968
[Mio]
The same thing
happened last year.

55
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:41,971
Actually, that was the
Club Application...

56
00:03:42,013 --> 00:03:43,348
Ow!

57
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:46,184
[Ritsu]
Okay, Azusa,
you be the secretary.

58
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:49,688
[Azusa]
Me? Well, I guess I don't mind.

59
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:54,359
Let's see, "Applicant"
is Light Music Club...

60
00:03:54,401 --> 00:03:56,695
So, what do I put down
for "Name"?

61
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:58,196
[Ritsu]
The band name, I guess.

62
00:03:58,238 --> 00:03:59,531
[Azusa]
Right.

63
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:03,743
Now that you mention it,
what is the band's name?

64
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:07,789
-Sweets Smile! -Girl Gang!
-Chocolate Melody!

65
00:04:07,831 --> 00:04:09,040
<i>They're all different!</i>

66
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:10,625
We never settled on one.

67
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:12,961
Then it's the perfect time
to pick a name!

68
00:04:13,003 --> 00:04:14,212
[Yui]
I got it! How about...

69
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:16,214
"Yui Hirasawa and
the Bumbling Sisters"?

70
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:17,716
[Ritsu]
What are we, chopped liver?

71
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:19,551
[Mio]
How about something
like "Pure Pure"?

72
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:22,554
[Ritsu]
Enough with the jokes,
let's be serious about this.

73
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:25,098
But I was being serious...

74
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:26,516
You really meant that?!

75
00:04:26,558 --> 00:04:28,059
Well, everyone has
different tastes.

76
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:29,102
It doesn't make them wrong.

77
00:04:29,144 --> 00:04:30,603
[Yamanaka]
All right, then!

78
00:04:30,645 --> 00:04:31,563
Huh?

79
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:33,356
I'll choose the band name!

80
00:04:33,398 --> 00:04:35,316
I think we should all give it
a little more thought!

81
00:04:35,358 --> 00:04:36,609
<i>They pulled together...</i>

82
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:38,028
[Nodoka]
Just bring the paperwork

83
00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:40,739
to the Student Council Office
when you're done.

84
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:43,074
I'm sorry that we made you
wait for nothing.

85
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:44,159
It's all right.

86
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,577
Nodoka-chan, why don't you and I

87
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:47,120
stop and grab some tea
on the way home!

88
00:04:47,162 --> 00:04:50,874
Sure, Yui,
I'll text you later.

89
00:04:50,915 --> 00:04:53,585
Okay, why don't we all just
sleep on the band name tonight

90
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:55,962
and get to practicing our set
for the show now?

91
00:04:56,004 --> 00:04:57,505
I agree!

92
00:04:57,547 --> 00:05:00,342
The Festival's soon, so we
have to give it 110 percent.

93
00:05:00,383 --> 00:05:01,509
I will!

94
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:03,053
[Yui]
Oh, sound!

95
00:05:03,094 --> 00:05:05,847
My guitar hasn't really been
sounding quite right lately.

96
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:09,351
Huh? You want me to take
a quick look at it?

97
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,436
Eh?!

98
00:05:11,478 --> 00:05:13,855
These strings are all corroded!

99
00:05:13,897 --> 00:05:14,898
When was the last time

100
00:05:14,939 --> 00:05:16,649
you changed them out
for new ones, Yui?

101
00:05:16,691 --> 00:05:20,070
Huh? You mean supposed to
change the strings?

102
00:05:21,196 --> 00:05:22,739
Wh-what?

103
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:24,783
Plus, the neck is warped!

104
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:26,701
Didn't you know that
a warped guitar neck

105
00:05:26,743 --> 00:05:29,162
can completely throw off
the octave tuning!

106
00:05:29,204 --> 00:05:32,123
Uh... Neck? Octa?

107
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:33,541
[Mio]
Calm down, Azusa!

108
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:36,670
This is way too much
for Yui to digest.

109
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:39,047
Basically...

110
00:05:39,089 --> 00:05:41,549
you have to take really good
care of your instrument.

111
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:42,967
This is a beautiful guitar!

112
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:45,470
Oh! But I do take
good care of it!

113
00:05:45,512 --> 00:05:47,138
I sleep with it every night.

114
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,556
I dress it up nice.

115
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:51,142
That's not what I mean by
"taking care of it"!

116
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:52,686
In that case,
is there anything

117
00:05:52,727 --> 00:05:55,939
you can do to fix it,
Ms. Yamanaka?

118
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:57,023
Huh?!

119
00:05:57,065 --> 00:05:58,316
I think you'd be better off

120
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:00,360
taking it to the
music store, don't you?

121
00:06:00,402 --> 00:06:02,153
[Ritsu]
You just can't be bothered.

122
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:03,822
(laughing)

123
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:07,117
You and I better just go
to the music store, then.

124
00:06:07,158 --> 00:06:09,035
What? It isn't
that serious, is it?

125
00:06:09,077 --> 00:06:10,745
The festival's coming up,

126
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:13,373
and we can't practice with your
guitar in the shape it's in!

127
00:06:13,415 --> 00:06:16,042
Oh...

128
00:06:16,084 --> 00:06:18,503
Ritchan, you don't do any
upkeep on your drums, do you?

129
00:06:18,545 --> 00:06:20,046
Yes, I do!

130
00:06:20,088 --> 00:06:21,506
Oh...

131
00:06:21,548 --> 00:06:23,049
And even if I didn't,
don't make it sound like

132
00:06:23,091 --> 00:06:25,844
a foregone conclusion
that I don't.

133
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:29,014
It IS you we're talking about...

134
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:31,182
[Yui]
Ow!

135
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:33,351
[Ritsu]
Okay, here we are.

136
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:35,979
Hey, I'll wait for
you guys out here, okay?

137
00:06:36,021 --> 00:06:38,231
But, why aren't you
coming inside?

138
00:06:38,273 --> 00:06:40,650
You see, the thing is
I'm a lefty,

139
00:06:40,692 --> 00:06:42,694
so looking at all those
right-handed instruments

140
00:06:42,736 --> 00:06:44,696
would only make me sad.

141
00:06:44,738 --> 00:06:46,573
Ah.

142
00:06:46,614 --> 00:06:48,825
[Ritsu]
Hey, Mio, check this out!

143
00:06:48,867 --> 00:06:51,369
It says here that they're
having a Lefty Fair today.

144
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:52,203
Huh?!

145
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:54,080
Oh!

146
00:06:56,458 --> 00:06:58,918
Have I died and
gone to Heaven?

147
00:07:00,754 --> 00:07:02,088
Clerk! I want you to give me

148
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:03,757
everything you have
on display here!

149
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:05,383
Hey, Mio, get a grip girl.

150
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:07,260
Boy, Mio-chan sure looks happy.

151
00:07:07,302 --> 00:07:10,430
That's cause there's not a lot
of models made for lefties.

152
00:07:10,472 --> 00:07:13,016
So, you want to just
go on without them?

153
00:07:13,058 --> 00:07:14,434
Mmhm.

154
00:07:15,393 --> 00:07:17,187
-Excuse us!
-How can I help you?

155
00:07:17,228 --> 00:07:19,564
We were wondering if you
could make some adjustments

156
00:07:19,606 --> 00:07:20,940
on a guitar for us.

157
00:07:20,982 --> 00:07:22,525
Yeah, sure thing.
On which guitar?

158
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:23,943
This one.

159
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:25,987
Ah. Well, why don't we
have a look at it

160
00:07:26,029 --> 00:07:27,781
and see what we've got.

161
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:36,122
Um, is this a vintage guitar?

162
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:39,417
No. We're sorry. It's just
kind of dirty, that's all.

163
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:41,336
It's been a year
since I bought it!

164
00:07:41,378 --> 00:07:43,213
I-I see...

165
00:07:43,254 --> 00:07:46,675
Well, feel free to wait
in the store until I'm done.

166
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:48,760
Thank you very much.

167
00:07:49,427 --> 00:07:51,012
(sigh)

168
00:07:51,054 --> 00:07:54,307
Well, let's browse around
the store until he's done.

169
00:07:54,349 --> 00:07:56,142
Hey. What's the matter, Yui?

170
00:07:56,184 --> 00:07:59,771
Uhh...

171
00:07:59,813 --> 00:08:02,607
My poor guitar is being
stripped naked bit by bit!

172
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:04,609
What are you talking about?

173
00:08:04,651 --> 00:08:06,569
I'm curious about
something, Yui?

174
00:08:06,611 --> 00:08:09,155
Why did you buy that
guitar in the first place?

175
00:08:09,197 --> 00:08:12,450
I mean, look at it. It's heavy,
and it's got a thick neck.

176
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:14,285
It's got all sorts of quirks.

177
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:16,871
Huh? I got it
because it's cute!

178
00:08:18,123 --> 00:08:19,207
Because it's cute?

179
00:08:19,249 --> 00:08:20,667
Yeah, that's right.

180
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:23,795
Huh? You do think it's cute?
Don't you, Azu-nyan?

181
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:26,673
<i>I don't get</i>
<i>Yui-senpai's tastes.</i>

182
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:30,176
Sorry we kept you waiting!

183
00:08:30,218 --> 00:08:33,096
We dropped it off to have
them do some maintenance.

184
00:08:33,138 --> 00:08:34,431
Right. Good deal.

185
00:08:34,472 --> 00:08:36,474
Wait a minute.
Where did Mio-senpai go?

186
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:37,976
Oh, Mio is still
over there checking out-

187
00:08:38,018 --> 00:08:39,811
[Clerk]
Miss Kotobuki!

188
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:40,895
Huh?

189
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:42,480
It's so good to
see you again, Miss!

190
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:44,024
Oh, hello.

191
00:08:44,065 --> 00:08:47,318
Hey! If it isn't Miss Kotobuki!
It's been too long!

192
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,820
Mugi says that this shop

193
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:50,864
is part of her family's
business consortium.

194
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:52,365
Uh!

195
00:08:52,407 --> 00:08:55,326
It's always a shock to hear
someone call her that, isn't it?

196
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:57,245
[Clerk]
Thank you for waiting.

197
00:08:57,287 --> 00:08:59,456
Ah!

198
00:08:59,497 --> 00:09:01,166
[Ritsu]
It's all clean again!

199
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:04,544
Make sure you keep it
maintained from now on.

200
00:09:05,086 --> 00:09:06,713
Geeta!

201
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:09,883
[Ritsu]
<i>She named the thing...</i>

202
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:12,093
Oh, thank you so much, sir!

203
00:09:12,135 --> 00:09:13,678
D-don't mention it.

204
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:16,431
So, the bill
comes to 50 dollars.

205
00:09:16,473 --> 00:09:17,974
Huh?

206
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:20,643
You charge for this?

207
00:09:20,685 --> 00:09:22,062
U-um, yes.

208
00:09:22,103 --> 00:09:24,314
Well, of course
they charge for it!

209
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:26,358
I have no money.

210
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,276
-Huh?!
-What do I do?

211
00:09:28,318 --> 00:09:29,819
What's the matter?

212
00:09:29,861 --> 00:09:32,155
Well, it looks like Yui-senpai

213
00:09:32,197 --> 00:09:35,367
didn't know that music stores
charge for maintenance work.

214
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:36,701
Oh, she didn't, huh?

215
00:09:36,743 --> 00:09:39,788
Oh, goodness.
Did I bring any pocket money?

216
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:41,539
O-oh, M-Miss, no...

217
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:43,875
Perish the thought!
Consider it on the house!

218
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:44,668
Huh?!

219
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:46,378
No, I couldn't possibly!

220
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:47,712
Please, think nothing of it!

221
00:09:47,754 --> 00:09:49,673
We're constantly in
your father's debt!

222
00:09:49,714 --> 00:09:51,049
-But, I...
-I insist!

223
00:09:51,091 --> 00:09:54,260
Well, it looks like you
just lucked out.

224
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:55,595
That's that, then!

225
00:09:55,637 --> 00:09:57,222
What do you say we
all get going?

226
00:09:57,263 --> 00:09:58,890
Yeah!

227
00:09:58,932 --> 00:09:59,474
Um...

228
00:09:59,516 --> 00:10:00,642
Hm?

229
00:10:00,684 --> 00:10:02,227
Aren't we forgetting Mio-senpai?

230
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:04,896
Yeah. I'll go call her.

231
00:10:04,938 --> 00:10:06,356
Mio!

232
00:10:06,398 --> 00:10:08,149
C'mon, it's time to go!

233
00:10:08,191 --> 00:10:09,275
Don't wanna.

234
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:11,111
Are you a grade schooler?

235
00:10:11,152 --> 00:10:13,405
Look, everybody's waiting for
you and we have to get back.

236
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:14,572
Don't wanna.

237
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:18,702
Sheesh! C'mon, Mio, let's go!

238
00:10:18,743 --> 00:10:20,328
Hey, Ritsu!

239
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:22,455
Let's go home now, Mio.

240
00:10:22,497 --> 00:10:24,124
I know one person

241
00:10:24,165 --> 00:10:26,668
who actually likes to string
his guitar in reverse order.

242
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:29,921
[Mio]
Hey, wait! Watch it!

243
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:31,006
Huh?

244
00:10:31,423 --> 00:10:32,757
Uh...

245
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:35,593
Hey, what'cha doing
down there, Mio?

246
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:37,303
Enough, already!

247
00:10:38,221 --> 00:10:39,389
You jerk.

248
00:10:40,724 --> 00:10:42,350
(Bells chime)

249
00:10:42,392 --> 00:10:46,021
Thank goodness,
Geeta is all pretty again!

250
00:10:46,062 --> 00:10:48,773
You gave your guitar
a name, huh? That's nice.

251
00:10:48,815 --> 00:10:50,567
What do you want to do now?

252
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:52,861
Hmm, good question...

253
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:55,280
Hey! How about going for tea?!

254
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:57,032
Tea again? Really?

255
00:10:57,073 --> 00:10:58,533
Sorry, guys!

256
00:10:58,575 --> 00:11:01,244
But I'm supposed to get together
with Nodoka-chan right now.

257
00:11:01,286 --> 00:11:02,704
Uh...

258
00:11:02,746 --> 00:11:05,457
[Mio]
You're going to see Nodoka?
Can I tag along?

259
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:06,583
Huh?

260
00:11:06,624 --> 00:11:08,168
Oh, that's right!

261
00:11:08,209 --> 00:11:10,795
You and Nodoka-chan are in the
same class together, aren't you?

262
00:11:10,837 --> 00:11:12,547
-Sure.
-Really?

263
00:11:12,589 --> 00:11:15,300
I'm gonna give her a call and
let her know your coming.

264
00:11:15,342 --> 00:11:16,968
Great, thanks!

265
00:11:17,552 --> 00:11:19,054
Mm...

266
00:11:25,435 --> 00:11:27,062
K-ON!

267
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:31,316
(Yui giggles)

268
00:11:31,358 --> 00:11:34,277
Oh, I've always wanted
to try out this place!

269
00:11:34,319 --> 00:11:35,820
But you have no money?

270
00:11:35,862 --> 00:11:38,615
Oh, it's okay.
I'll pay for Yui's share.

271
00:11:38,656 --> 00:11:40,367
When I get next
month's allowance,

272
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:43,370
we'll all go out and it will
all be on me. How's that?

273
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:44,829
I'll hold you to that.

274
00:11:44,871 --> 00:11:47,123
So, is Yui really
doing all right

275
00:11:47,165 --> 00:11:49,125
at the Light Music Club,
like she says?

276
00:11:49,167 --> 00:11:50,960
Yeah, but whenever she
learns one thing,

277
00:11:51,002 --> 00:11:53,630
she has the tendency to
forget something else.

278
00:11:53,672 --> 00:11:55,048
I know how it is.

279
00:11:55,090 --> 00:11:56,633
But when she's
focused on something,

280
00:11:56,675 --> 00:11:58,426
she can do
amazing things.

281
00:11:58,468 --> 00:11:59,844
That's for sure!

282
00:11:59,886 --> 00:12:01,805
She can be a real
handful, can't she?

283
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:03,598
Huh? What'cha
talking about?

284
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:06,976
Feh. Those two sure seem to be
having a good time together.

285
00:12:07,018 --> 00:12:10,146
More to the point, why are we
sneaking around like this?

286
00:12:10,188 --> 00:12:14,067
Hehe. It's like we're private
investigators, isn't it?

287
00:12:15,694 --> 00:12:17,404
That's it, I'm going in.

288
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:19,322
And then the teacher
came up to me and-

289
00:12:19,364 --> 00:12:22,409
Well, you two sure seem
really friendly!

290
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:23,743
Huh?!

291
00:12:23,785 --> 00:12:25,995
Ritsu? What are
you doing here?

292
00:12:26,037 --> 00:12:27,914
Oh, I just happened
to be here.

293
00:12:27,956 --> 00:12:30,125
Did you come here
all by yourself?

294
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:32,794
Nope, Mugi and Azusa
are sitting over there.

295
00:12:32,836 --> 00:12:34,337
Huh? Oh, hey, they are!

296
00:12:34,379 --> 00:12:37,340
Oh gosh, thank you for
taking such good care

297
00:12:37,382 --> 00:12:38,508
of our little Mio!

298
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:39,843
Uh, Ritsu?

299
00:12:39,884 --> 00:12:42,762
Hm? What?
You want me to leave?

300
00:12:42,804 --> 00:12:46,016
Um... Well, no I don't, but...

301
00:12:46,057 --> 00:12:47,851
[Ritsu]
Then what's the problem?
What's that?! What did you get?

302
00:12:47,892 --> 00:12:49,936
What's she doing?

303
00:12:49,978 --> 00:12:52,897
Her ice cream is melting...

304
00:12:55,859 --> 00:12:58,486
[Mio]
Wow, that's a gorgeous
boxed lunch!

305
00:12:58,528 --> 00:13:00,071
No, it's not.

306
00:13:00,113 --> 00:13:02,449
I just threw together
whatever I had lying around.

307
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:05,368
Huh? You mean you make your own?
That's amazing!

308
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:07,996
Oh, come on, it's
no big deal. Really.

309
00:13:08,038 --> 00:13:09,789
No, mine are always-

310
00:13:09,831 --> 00:13:12,709
[Ritsu]
Okay, lunchtime is over!

311
00:13:12,751 --> 00:13:15,378
Ritsu? Sorry, but I
just started eating.

312
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:17,213
We're practicing through
every lunch break

313
00:13:17,255 --> 00:13:19,215
from now until the
school festival!

314
00:13:19,257 --> 00:13:21,968
Uh...

315
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:25,055
[Ritsu]
Gee, I wonder what Mio's
gonna do to liven things up

316
00:13:25,096 --> 00:13:27,974
at this year's big school
festival concert?

317
00:13:28,016 --> 00:13:30,810
She gave the crowd that
panty shot last year,

318
00:13:30,852 --> 00:13:33,813
so maybe she'll show her
belly button this time?

319
00:13:33,855 --> 00:13:35,065
Ooo... Or maybe...

320
00:13:35,106 --> 00:13:36,733
I thought we were
gonna practice!

321
00:13:36,775 --> 00:13:38,109
Uh?

322
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:41,279
And we will!

323
00:13:41,905 --> 00:13:43,365
Then why are you-

324
00:13:43,406 --> 00:13:45,617
Haha! Takoyaki!

325
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:47,202
Huh?

326
00:13:48,119 --> 00:13:50,205
-Ponytail!
-Hey!

327
00:13:50,246 --> 00:13:51,081
Braids!

328
00:13:51,122 --> 00:13:53,917
Come on, cut it out!

329
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:55,460
What's gotten into you?

330
00:13:55,502 --> 00:13:58,254
Oh, guess what I brought?
A great horror movie!

331
00:13:58,296 --> 00:14:01,216
So scary, it will make
your hair stand up!

332
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:03,593
This is stupid!
I'm going back to my classroom.

333
00:14:03,635 --> 00:14:05,595
All right.
Suit yourself.

334
00:14:05,637 --> 00:14:06,638
Uh...

335
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:07,972
Gosh, I'm so sorry

336
00:14:08,014 --> 00:14:09,599
I interrupted your
wonderfully pleasant

337
00:14:09,641 --> 00:14:12,602
lunchtime with Nodoka,
your brand new best friend.

338
00:14:12,644 --> 00:14:14,771
Huh?

339
00:14:14,813 --> 00:14:16,773
Who said anything about that?!

340
00:14:16,815 --> 00:14:19,693
I don't get it.
Why are they fighting?

341
00:14:19,734 --> 00:14:21,152
Uh...

342
00:14:21,194 --> 00:14:25,156
How about some tea?
Let's have tea! All right?

343
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:26,991
I brought some
lovely tarts today.

344
00:14:27,033 --> 00:14:29,452
<i>Wh-what should I do?</i>
<i>I have to do something!</i>

345
00:14:29,494 --> 00:14:30,995
<i>Anything!</i>

346
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:35,291
Let's all be friends
and practice together

347
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:37,252
like we planned!

348
00:14:38,128 --> 00:14:41,965
<i>I-it didn't work!</i>

349
00:14:42,007 --> 00:14:45,510
[Ritsu]
Yeah, I guess we
should practice.

350
00:14:48,096 --> 00:14:49,931
Let's get started.

351
00:14:50,849 --> 00:14:53,476
S-sure! All right!

352
00:14:53,518 --> 00:14:54,769
One, two!

353
00:14:54,811 --> 00:14:58,023
(playing music)

354
00:15:01,693 --> 00:15:03,445
Uh...

355
00:15:04,195 --> 00:15:05,613
Huh?

356
00:15:10,201 --> 00:15:10,910
Ritsu?

357
00:15:10,952 --> 00:15:12,454
What gives?

358
00:15:12,495 --> 00:15:14,789
I'm glad that your drumming
isn't as wild as usual,

359
00:15:14,831 --> 00:15:17,292
but don't you think
it's a little weak?

360
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:20,211
Ritsu?

361
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:24,299
Ritsu, what is it?

362
00:15:24,341 --> 00:15:25,842
Aw, sorry.

363
00:15:25,884 --> 00:15:28,678
I'm just not
feeling it right now.

364
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,931
Let's try it again
after school.

365
00:15:31,973 --> 00:15:33,058
R-Ritchan...!

366
00:15:33,099 --> 00:15:34,934
Let her go, Yui.

367
00:15:35,518 --> 00:15:37,145
But she...

368
00:15:39,564 --> 00:15:41,024
Twerp.

369
00:15:48,365 --> 00:15:51,368
I guess Ritsu isn't coming...

370
00:15:51,409 --> 00:15:52,702
(sigh)

371
00:15:52,744 --> 00:15:55,163
She didn't come after
school yesterday, either.

372
00:15:55,205 --> 00:15:57,332
[Yui]
I wonder what's wrong?

373
00:15:59,209 --> 00:16:02,671
I'd say it was because Mio
has been so cold to her.

374
00:16:02,712 --> 00:16:03,880
Huh?

375
00:16:03,922 --> 00:16:05,340
For the sake of the
Light Music Club,

376
00:16:05,382 --> 00:16:07,634
you need to be Ritsu's plaything
for at least a day!

377
00:16:07,676 --> 00:16:10,136
If you don't,
Ritsu's heart...

378
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:12,889
<i>...will grow harden.</i>

379
00:16:12,931 --> 00:16:14,349
Hey mister! A jumbo!

380
00:16:14,391 --> 00:16:15,975
<i>And she'll order</i>
<i>a jumbo beef bowl</i>

381
00:16:16,017 --> 00:16:17,477
<i>she knows she can't finish.</i>

382
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:18,561
What am I doing?

383
00:16:18,603 --> 00:16:20,397
<i>She'll be driven to despair.</i>

384
00:16:20,438 --> 00:16:23,608
<i>And she'll go so far down</i>
<i>the path of heavy metal...</i>

385
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:26,152
she'll never find her way back!

386
00:16:26,194 --> 00:16:28,196
That's what happened to you
when you got dumped

387
00:16:28,238 --> 00:16:29,989
by your boyfriend, isn't it?

388
00:16:30,031 --> 00:16:31,741
Pardon?

389
00:16:31,783 --> 00:16:35,704
What if she decides not to
come back to the club anymore...

390
00:16:35,745 --> 00:16:37,205
Huh?

391
00:16:37,247 --> 00:16:40,709
What'll happen to our concert
at the school festival?

392
00:16:44,295 --> 00:16:45,672
Come on, let's practice.

393
00:16:45,714 --> 00:16:47,590
You mean without Ritchan?

394
00:16:47,632 --> 00:16:48,967
What else can we do?

395
00:16:49,009 --> 00:16:50,343
Aww...

396
00:16:50,385 --> 00:16:54,264
But, shouldn't we go ask
her to join us first?

397
00:16:54,305 --> 00:16:55,598
Um...

398
00:16:56,975 --> 00:16:58,476
(sigh)

399
00:16:58,518 --> 00:17:02,022
[Yamanaka]
You could also start
looking for a replacement.

400
00:17:02,063 --> 00:17:03,314
Now, I'm just saying

401
00:17:03,356 --> 00:17:05,442
that it's always a
good idea to be prepared.

402
00:17:05,483 --> 00:17:06,401
But...

403
00:17:06,443 --> 00:17:08,987
There's no replacing Ritchan!

404
00:17:10,363 --> 00:17:11,448
Mugi-chan...

405
00:17:11,489 --> 00:17:12,574
Let's just wait.

406
00:17:13,491 --> 00:17:16,411
Let's wait for Ritsu
to come back to us.

407
00:17:17,162 --> 00:17:18,872
I know she'll come.

408
00:17:18,913 --> 00:17:19,998
I know it.

409
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,416
(sigh)

410
00:17:27,881 --> 00:17:28,965
(sigh)

411
00:17:29,007 --> 00:17:30,633
Ah, Mio!

412
00:17:30,675 --> 00:17:31,718
Uh...

413
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,011
Mugi-chan you were right!

414
00:17:33,053 --> 00:17:34,304
Oh, good morning.

415
00:17:34,346 --> 00:17:36,348
Listen, Mio,
about Ritchan, she's...

416
00:17:36,389 --> 00:17:41,102
Look, I didn't come here to
check up on Ritsu. I, uh...

417
00:17:42,187 --> 00:17:45,023
She's been staying home
from school.

418
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:47,025
Huh?

419
00:17:47,067 --> 00:17:48,693
(giggles)

420
00:17:51,154 --> 00:17:54,491
(kids chatter)

421
00:17:59,954 --> 00:18:04,334
(noises outside)

422
00:18:08,546 --> 00:18:10,215
(sigh)

423
00:18:13,259 --> 00:18:15,303
(footsteps)

424
00:18:21,643 --> 00:18:23,228
[Ritsu]
Mio...

425
00:18:25,689 --> 00:18:27,607
So now you have ESP?

426
00:18:29,526 --> 00:18:33,655
I think I can recognize
your footsteps.

427
00:18:34,823 --> 00:18:36,241
(sigh)

428
00:18:41,621 --> 00:18:42,872
How's the cold?

429
00:18:42,914 --> 00:18:45,917
I still have
a bit of a fever.

430
00:18:45,959 --> 00:18:48,962
I guess that explains why your
drumming sounded so weak.

431
00:18:49,004 --> 00:18:53,466
Heck of a time to get sick,
right before the festival...

432
00:18:53,508 --> 00:18:55,969
You just get better quick, okay?

433
00:18:56,011 --> 00:18:58,430
We're all waiting
for you to come back.

434
00:18:59,097 --> 00:19:00,598
They're not mad?

435
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,725
They're not.

436
00:19:01,766 --> 00:19:03,268
Are you?

437
00:19:05,061 --> 00:19:08,273
Of course not.
How could I be mad at you?

438
00:19:09,065 --> 00:19:10,066
It's just...

439
00:19:10,108 --> 00:19:11,109
Just what?

440
00:19:11,151 --> 00:19:13,236
Without you there drumming,

441
00:19:13,278 --> 00:19:16,239
I guess it's kinda lonely.

442
00:19:16,281 --> 00:19:18,491
Even though you're pretty wild,

443
00:19:18,533 --> 00:19:21,119
I really like how your
drumming is always so

444
00:19:21,161 --> 00:19:23,788
full of energy and powerful.

445
00:19:27,125 --> 00:19:27,917
Uh?

446
00:19:27,959 --> 00:19:29,044
(giggles)

447
00:19:29,085 --> 00:19:30,795
Ritsu! Were you...

448
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:34,632
Hooray, I'm cured!

449
00:19:35,592 --> 00:19:36,301
(sneeze)

450
00:19:36,343 --> 00:19:38,303
Oh, Ritsu, you are not!

451
00:19:39,137 --> 00:19:41,097
Come on now, lie down.

452
00:19:41,139 --> 00:19:43,141
You still have a fever.

453
00:19:43,183 --> 00:19:44,267
(groans)

454
00:19:44,309 --> 00:19:46,269
I'm going home, okay?

455
00:19:46,311 --> 00:19:49,064
Aw! C'mon, don't go yet!

456
00:19:49,105 --> 00:19:52,484
Stay until I fall asleep!
Please!

457
00:19:53,109 --> 00:19:54,736
Oh, good grief.

458
00:19:55,570 --> 00:19:56,738
(laugh)

459
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:02,494
(knocking)

460
00:20:03,411 --> 00:20:05,163
Excuse us. Can we come in?

461
00:20:05,205 --> 00:20:08,500
-Ritchan, how are-
-Shhh...

462
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:10,794
I was finally able to
get her to go to sleep.

463
00:20:10,835 --> 00:20:12,462
Ahh...

464
00:20:15,215 --> 00:20:19,135
Um, why did Yui
fall asleep, too?

465
00:20:19,177 --> 00:20:21,221
Oh, good grief...

466
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:29,020
I'm back!

467
00:20:29,062 --> 00:20:32,649
Now, let's bust our butts to
get ready for the festival!

468
00:20:32,691 --> 00:20:34,025
Yeah!

469
00:20:34,067 --> 00:20:35,610
Hey!

470
00:20:35,652 --> 00:20:39,030
You guys didn't submit your
auditorium use permission form?!

471
00:20:39,072 --> 00:20:40,448
Huh?

472
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:41,950
Ah!

473
00:20:41,991 --> 00:20:43,410
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

474
00:20:43,451 --> 00:20:45,537
A deadline is a
deadline, you know.

475
00:20:45,578 --> 00:20:47,163
Couldn't you bend the rules?

476
00:20:47,205 --> 00:20:48,998
I'd like to appeal
on their behalf.

477
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,750
They missed the
submission deadline

478
00:20:50,792 --> 00:20:53,211
because the club president
was home sick with a cold.

479
00:20:53,253 --> 00:20:55,797
Please make an exception.

480
00:20:55,839 --> 00:20:58,633
Well, if you feel this
strongly, Miss Manabe...

481
00:20:58,675 --> 00:21:00,802
You have until
the end of the day.

482
00:21:00,844 --> 00:21:02,178
Ah!

483
00:21:02,971 --> 00:21:05,181
Oh! Oh, you!

484
00:21:05,223 --> 00:21:07,183
You're a good egg, ain't cha!

485
00:21:07,225 --> 00:21:08,893
Please look after Mio!

486
00:21:08,935 --> 00:21:10,311
And please, while your at it,

487
00:21:10,353 --> 00:21:12,647
you can look after me
from now on, too, right?

488
00:21:12,689 --> 00:21:13,690
Hey!

489
00:21:16,026 --> 00:21:17,485
[Mio]
What's wrong with "Pure Pure"?

490
00:21:17,527 --> 00:21:19,029
[Ritsu]
Rejected.

491
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:20,280
[Yui]
How about "Clenched Fist"?

492
00:21:20,321 --> 00:21:21,740
[Ritsu]
Too balladie.

493
00:21:21,781 --> 00:21:23,700
[Yui]
How about "Gum On the
Sole of My Shoe"?

494
00:21:23,742 --> 00:21:25,326
[Ritsu]
You stepped in some, didn't you?

495
00:21:25,368 --> 00:21:26,870
[Yui]
Oh! How did you know?

496
00:21:26,911 --> 00:21:29,539
[Ritsu]
Mugi, don't you have
any good ones?

497
00:21:29,581 --> 00:21:32,500
Hm... How about something
like "Recharging Time"?

498
00:21:32,542 --> 00:21:33,752
[Ritsu]
Sounds like bad luck!

499
00:21:33,793 --> 00:21:35,795
[Mio]
How about "Popcorn Honeymoon"?

500
00:21:35,837 --> 00:21:39,299
[Ritsu]
Oh, come on guys, what's with
all these silly, cutesy names?

501
00:21:39,341 --> 00:21:41,176
What do you think of
"Rocket Pencil"?

502
00:21:41,217 --> 00:21:42,260
[Ritsu]
Would you hush!

503
00:21:42,302 --> 00:21:44,054
God, this is annoying!

504
00:21:44,095 --> 00:21:45,722
I can't even enjoy a
nice cup of tea!

505
00:21:45,764 --> 00:21:48,725
For stuff like this,
just pick something at random!

506
00:21:48,767 --> 00:21:49,559
All done!

507
00:21:49,601 --> 00:21:50,518
Ah!

508
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:52,854
She decided it on her own!

509
00:21:52,896 --> 00:21:54,272
Aww...

510
00:21:56,941 --> 00:21:58,651
What the heck.

511
00:21:59,736 --> 00:22:00,862
Hm.

512
00:22:04,199 --> 00:22:05,075
Mmhm!

513
00:22:05,116 --> 00:22:07,035
(laughing)

514
00:22:07,077 --> 00:22:08,286
All right!

515
00:22:08,328 --> 00:22:10,372
We've settled on a band name!

516
00:22:10,413 --> 00:22:11,998
[Azusa]
All that's left now

517
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:14,751
is to practice hard for
the School Festival concert.

518
00:22:14,793 --> 00:22:15,710
(sneeze)

519
00:22:15,752 --> 00:22:16,878
Oh...

520
00:22:17,879 --> 00:22:20,382
Maybe not...

521
00:22:20,423 --> 00:22:22,509
("Don't say 'lazy'" plays)

522
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:53,058
So, her fever hasn't
gone down yet...

523
00:23:53,099 --> 00:23:56,770
No. If this keeps up
tomorrow's show is in danger.

524
00:23:56,811 --> 00:23:58,396
Getting sick at
a time like this

525
00:23:58,438 --> 00:24:00,315
just shows her
lack of dedication!

526
00:24:00,357 --> 00:24:02,067
You're the one who
gave it to her!

527
00:24:02,108 --> 00:24:04,027
Oh! I did?

528
00:24:04,861 --> 00:24:06,196
Oh, Big Sis...

529
00:24:06,237 --> 00:24:10,367
You may have fooled the others,
but you can't fool me.

530
00:24:10,408 --> 00:24:11,826
(nervous sigh)

531
00:24:11,868 --> 00:24:14,120
