<i>Hello, I'm Ui Hirasawa.</i>

00:00:13,388 --> 00:00:15,682
<i>My high school</i>
<i>entrance exams are over,</i>

3
00:00:15,724 --> 00:00:19,019
<i>and this spring, I will be</i>
<i>joining my sister Yui at--</i>

4
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:21,104
[Yui]
Ui!

5
00:00:21,146 --> 00:00:23,356
W-was y-y-your name th-there?

6
00:00:23,398 --> 00:00:26,151
What's the matter with you, Sis?
Why are you so nervous?

7
00:00:26,192 --> 00:00:27,861
B-because!

8
00:00:27,902 --> 00:00:30,405
My name was there.
I passed, Sis.

9
00:00:30,447 --> 00:00:31,573
Really?!

10
00:00:31,614 --> 00:00:33,074
Uh-huh!

11
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:35,493
Oh...

12
00:00:35,535 --> 00:00:38,079
(crying)

13
00:00:40,623 --> 00:00:43,293
Uh, Sis? I really
can't breathe...

14
00:00:43,335 --> 00:00:45,879
You did so good!
You did great!

15
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:50,467
Thank you! Thank you!
Thank you! Thank you so much!

16
00:00:50,508 --> 00:00:52,510
It was thanks to the
kind support of each and

17
00:00:52,552 --> 00:00:54,721
every one of you here today,
that Ui managed to pass

18
00:00:54,763 --> 00:00:57,599
and begin her journey to
a happy and successful life!

19
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:58,892
(click)

20
00:00:58,933 --> 00:01:00,769
well, it looks like Ui passed.

21
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:03,563
Looks like Yui is the
happier of the two.

22
00:01:03,605 --> 00:01:04,898
A doting parent?

23
00:01:04,939 --> 00:01:08,068
Or a doting sister,
is more like it.

24
00:01:08,109 --> 00:01:12,030
<i>It sure is shaping up</i>
<i>to be a happy spring.</i>

25
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:14,074
Congratulations, Ui.

26
00:01:14,115 --> 00:01:15,283
Yeah, way to go!

27
00:01:15,325 --> 00:01:17,369
Thank you.
Thank you, everybody.

28
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:23,041
Uh...

29
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:25,418
There it is.

30
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:27,879
("Cagayake! Girls" plays)

31
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:58,386
[girl]
We're in the same class again!

32
00:02:58,428 --> 00:03:00,513
[girl]
Mr. Akai's our homeroom teacher?

33
00:03:00,555 --> 00:03:03,933
[girl]
I wonder if I'll be in the
same class as Yoshiko-chan?

34
00:03:05,268 --> 00:03:07,604
[Yui]
And... there I am!

35
00:03:07,645 --> 00:03:09,731
2nd Year, Class 2, huh?

36
00:03:09,773 --> 00:03:10,774
Yeah, so am I!

37
00:03:10,815 --> 00:03:13,109
Oh, look!
So am I! Class 2!

38
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:14,944
Really! No way! That's great!

39
00:03:14,986 --> 00:03:16,738
How bout you, Mio?

40
00:03:17,364 --> 00:03:18,782
Class 1...

41
00:03:18,823 --> 00:03:21,326
Uh... Um...

42
00:03:21,368 --> 00:03:23,161
Hey! What's with those looks?

43
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:26,498
If you ever get lonely,
come over to visit
whenever you want!

44
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:28,166
What am I,
a grade schooler!

45
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:31,795
Are you gonna be okay
away from me, huh?

46
00:03:31,836 --> 00:03:33,630
I won't be able to
crib off my homework.

47
00:03:33,672 --> 00:03:35,632
Ha! You don't have to
worry about me!

48
00:03:35,674 --> 00:03:37,967
I'll have Mugi with me
to help me out!

49
00:03:38,009 --> 00:03:38,843
Hm!

50
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:40,470
[Ui]
Hello, everyone!

51
00:03:40,512 --> 00:03:42,180
A very good morning!

52
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:44,349
Oh! The uniform
looks great on you!

53
00:03:44,391 --> 00:03:46,101
You look so innocent!

54
00:03:46,142 --> 00:03:48,687
Y-you really think so?

55
00:03:49,938 --> 00:03:51,898
Sis, your collar.

56
00:03:53,024 --> 00:03:55,318
You left the tag from
the dry-cleaner on.

57
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,446
Wow, you're right!

58
00:03:58,488 --> 00:04:01,574
And also, you've got
a bad case of bed head.

59
00:04:01,616 --> 00:04:03,535
I didn't have time
to brush it this morning!

60
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:07,163
Let's try to get up a
little earlier starting
tomorrow, all right?

61
00:04:07,205 --> 00:04:08,581
Uh-huh...

62
00:04:08,623 --> 00:04:10,166
You know, maybe you two
would be much better off

63
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:12,377
if you switched ages
with each other.

64
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:14,379
(bell rings)

65
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:17,507
Well, see you later.

66
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,427
I guess we should
take off, too.

67
00:04:20,468 --> 00:04:24,055
(Yui)
Huh? Class 2 is up on
the second floor?

68
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:25,557
That's right.

69
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:27,434
It's like we're literally
upperclassmen now.

70
00:04:27,475 --> 00:04:31,062
See ya around, you Year 2,
Floor 1, Class 1 student you!

71
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:32,689
Oh yeah! Bite me!

72
00:04:32,731 --> 00:04:34,607
[Mugi]
We'll see you at break!

73
00:04:34,649 --> 00:04:36,776
[Yui]
Where on the second floor is it?

74
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:38,737
[Ritsu]
I think somewhere around...

75
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:39,988
(sigh)

76
00:04:43,575 --> 00:04:45,577
I'm lonely...

77
00:04:46,745 --> 00:04:50,123
(classroom chatter)

78
00:04:56,629 --> 00:04:59,674
<i>There isn't a single</i>
<i>girl here that I know.</i>

79
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:02,510
[Nodoka]
Mio! Glad to see you!

80
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:04,179
I was worried that
I wouldn't know anyone

81
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:06,222
when I was put in a
different class than Yui.

82
00:05:06,264 --> 00:05:07,682
(crying)

83
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:09,726
Here's hoping for
a good year together.

84
00:05:09,768 --> 00:05:11,436
Same here!

85
00:05:11,478 --> 00:05:13,938
*

86
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:21,112
Want to join
the Basketball Club?

87
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:23,823
The Tea Ceremony Club
really is a lot of fun!

88
00:05:23,865 --> 00:05:25,742
Consider the
Occult Studies Club!

89
00:05:25,784 --> 00:05:29,245
Are you interested
in ping pong?

90
00:05:29,287 --> 00:05:31,623
Wow, look at this,
the halls are packed already!

91
00:05:31,664 --> 00:05:34,626
Large clubs certainly have
more recruiting options.

92
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:37,629
Don't ever underestimate
the Light Music Club!

93
00:05:37,671 --> 00:05:39,297
Mio, got the flyers?

94
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:41,758
Well, I kinda threw
this together.

95
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,385
"Kinda" is right...

96
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:44,427
Ah!

97
00:05:44,469 --> 00:05:45,970
It lacks any selling points!

98
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:48,181
What exactly are
our selling points?

99
00:05:48,223 --> 00:05:51,768
Something like, "Come and
join the Light Music Club,

100
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:53,520
where you get all the
tea and snacks you want,

101
00:05:53,561 --> 00:05:54,979
and get to sleep!"

102
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:56,773
-That sounds great!
-No it doesn't!

103
00:05:56,815 --> 00:05:58,900
Well, do you have any
better ideas?

104
00:05:58,942 --> 00:06:02,112
'Cause the way it is now,
it's got no impact!

105
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:07,826
If it doesn't, we'll just
have to give it some!

106
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:09,536
[Mio]
We're the Light Music Club...

107
00:06:09,577 --> 00:06:12,497
[Mugi]
We're holding a performance
to welcome new students, meow.

108
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:14,332
Please be sure to come, meow.

109
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:18,461
[Ritsu]
If you're interested, come to
the Music Room after school!

110
00:06:18,503 --> 00:06:19,796
Woof, woof, woof!

111
00:06:19,838 --> 00:06:23,133
[Yui]
There's also lots of
yummy snacks, cluck!

112
00:06:24,092 --> 00:06:25,385
Uh, Mio-chan...

113
00:06:25,427 --> 00:06:26,845
Wh-what is it?

114
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:29,806
It's doing the opposite
of what we wanted?

115
00:06:29,848 --> 00:06:32,475
Yeah, that just
occurred to me, too.

116
00:06:32,517 --> 00:06:33,977
[Ui] Oh, really?
[Yui] Huh?

117
00:06:34,019 --> 00:06:37,480
[girl]
Yeah. So, what club do you
think I should join?

118
00:06:37,522 --> 00:06:39,315
It's a tough choice, huh?

119
00:06:39,357 --> 00:06:40,692
M-hm.

120
00:06:41,276 --> 00:06:42,360
(Yui running)

121
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:43,987
Ui!

122
00:06:44,362 --> 00:06:45,238
Big Sis?

123
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,782
(screams)

124
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:49,951
(panting)
Ui...

125
00:06:51,369 --> 00:06:52,412
What was that?

126
00:06:52,454 --> 00:06:53,913
Beats me.

127
00:06:54,873 --> 00:06:55,832
Huh? Ah!

128
00:06:55,874 --> 00:06:58,043
We're the Light Music Club.

129
00:06:58,084 --> 00:07:00,503
If you're interested, feel free
to come by the Music Prep Room

130
00:07:00,545 --> 00:07:02,339
on the third floor
after school.

131
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:04,215
Sure...

132
00:07:05,175 --> 00:07:07,302
What the heck?

133
00:07:07,344 --> 00:07:10,221
[Mio]
You know you shouldn't
run at people like that!

134
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:11,639
[Yui]
Yeah, I'm sorry...

135
00:07:11,681 --> 00:07:13,558
[Ritsu]
Oh man, these things
are way too hot...

136
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:16,853
[Mugi]
I think it's fun, like we're
working at a part-time job.

137
00:07:16,895 --> 00:07:20,148
[Yui]
You sure do like
working, Mugi-chan.

138
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:21,608
Uh...

139
00:07:21,649 --> 00:07:23,526
Come on, Azusa.
Let's go.

140
00:07:23,568 --> 00:07:24,861
Uh-huh.

141
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:27,906
(girls panting)

142
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:31,493
[Yui]
After all that sweating,
we hardly had any takers.

143
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:34,537
[Ritsu]
We'll just have to make up for
it at tomorrow's performance!

144
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:35,914
[Mugi]
You're right.

145
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:38,041
(sigh)

146
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:39,250
Excuse me.

147
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:41,670
But I made all these
outfits for you, too.

148
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:45,090
Uh, well, afternoon
classes are starting!

149
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:47,759
[Ui]
The Light Music Club?

150
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:50,679
Yeah, all the girls came across
as being pretty cool.

151
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,888
Wanna check them out?

152
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:55,392
No thanks, I'll pass.
See ya.

153
00:07:55,433 --> 00:07:57,477
What's gotten into her?

154
00:07:57,519 --> 00:07:58,770
You'll come, right?

155
00:07:58,812 --> 00:08:00,730
Sure, I guess.
I'll go with you.

156
00:08:00,772 --> 00:08:02,232
Then let's go!

157
00:08:02,273 --> 00:08:03,733
Uh...

158
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:07,696
Azusa, Jazz Appreciation
is having a welcome meeting

159
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:10,115
in their club room
upstairs. Let's go.

160
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:11,241
Hm.

161
00:08:15,286 --> 00:08:16,204
Here it is.

162
00:08:16,246 --> 00:08:17,956
(knocking)

163
00:08:18,707 --> 00:08:19,833
Excuse us! May we come in?

164
00:08:19,874 --> 00:08:21,668
Welcome to our club room!

165
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:23,211
Uh, Big Sis?!

166
00:08:23,253 --> 00:08:24,337
Oh, Ui!

167
00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:26,089
You're joining the
Light Music Club?

168
00:08:26,131 --> 00:08:28,091
Wait, you two are
dressed up, too?

169
00:08:28,133 --> 00:08:31,177
-[Mio] Help me!
-[Yamanaka]Step aside, please!

170
00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:32,887
Come in, come in,
it's so good to see you!

171
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:34,472
Welcome to our club!

172
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:35,807
Uh...

173
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:38,101
First, could you explain
what that was?

174
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:40,979
[girl]
As I recall, it's suppose
to be two doors down

175
00:08:41,021 --> 00:08:43,773
from the Occult Studies club.

176
00:08:43,815 --> 00:08:46,818
(Mio screaming)

177
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:48,945
Huh? I wonder
what's up there?

178
00:08:48,987 --> 00:08:52,365
I'm not exactly sure, but I
think it's the Music Room.

179
00:08:52,407 --> 00:08:56,161
The Music Room, huh...

180
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:58,288
[Yui]
Ever since Christmas, it's like
Ms. Yamanaka has gotten

181
00:08:58,329 --> 00:09:01,207
totally addicted to putting
us in different costumes.

182
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:02,834
Ah, I see.

183
00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:06,463
Oh, I nearly forgot, this is
Yui, she's my big sister.

184
00:09:06,504 --> 00:09:08,131
I'm Yui Hirasawa.

185
00:09:08,173 --> 00:09:12,927
If you wait just a minute, I'll
go get you some nice, tasty tea.

186
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:14,929
It's okay to take
this one, isn't it?

187
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:17,349
It's pretty hot,
so be careful, okay.

188
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:18,433
Ow!

189
00:09:18,475 --> 00:09:19,684
Are you all right?

190
00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:21,770
S-Sis, are you okay?

191
00:09:22,354 --> 00:09:24,564
(nervous)

192
00:09:24,606 --> 00:09:26,733
(panicked)

193
00:09:26,775 --> 00:09:27,817
(sigh)

194
00:09:27,859 --> 00:09:29,402
You have a seat, Big Sis.

195
00:09:29,444 --> 00:09:31,321
I'll take it from here.

196
00:09:31,363 --> 00:09:32,655
Are you sure?

197
00:09:32,697 --> 00:09:34,282
Oh, Yui...

198
00:09:35,033 --> 00:09:36,409
Let me introduce Ritsu-san.

199
00:09:36,451 --> 00:09:39,704
Hi there. I'm the club
president, Ritsu Tainaka.

200
00:09:40,372 --> 00:09:42,248
[Nodoka]
Darn it, Ritsu!

201
00:09:42,957 --> 00:09:44,334
She seems really cool.

202
00:09:44,376 --> 00:09:46,544
You still haven't
submitted your request form

203
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:48,213
to use the school auditorium!

204
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:50,840
If you don't, you won't
be able perform tomorrow.

205
00:09:50,882 --> 00:09:52,175
Oh, you're right...

206
00:09:52,217 --> 00:09:54,010
I swear, how many times
do I have to tell you?

207
00:09:54,052 --> 00:09:56,012
Sorry! I'm sorry,
I'm so sorry!

208
00:09:56,054 --> 00:09:58,848
I want you to meet
Tsumugi Kotobuki.

209
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:00,350
It's a pleasure to meet you.

210
00:10:00,392 --> 00:10:01,685
And you, too.

211
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:03,853
I'm so sorry for
all the drama.

212
00:10:03,895 --> 00:10:05,647
[Ritsu]
Wait, wait!

213
00:10:05,689 --> 00:10:08,191
She seems like
she's really nice.

214
00:10:08,233 --> 00:10:10,527
And what's with these
silly getups, anyway?

215
00:10:10,568 --> 00:10:12,278
Hey, they weren't my idea!

216
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,446
Ah...

217
00:10:13,488 --> 00:10:15,365
Oh my, Ritsu...

218
00:10:15,407 --> 00:10:16,574
Huh?

219
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:20,870
And last but
not least is... huh?

220
00:10:22,122 --> 00:10:23,039
Her?

221
00:10:23,081 --> 00:10:25,125
Yeah, her name
is Mio Akiyama.

222
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:28,211
It's just that she gets
embarrassed really easily.

223
00:10:28,253 --> 00:10:29,379
Huh?

224
00:10:29,421 --> 00:10:30,672
What's the deal, Mio?

225
00:10:30,714 --> 00:10:31,881
Quit hiding out there
and come on in

226
00:10:31,923 --> 00:10:33,049
and join the rest of us.

227
00:10:33,091 --> 00:10:35,635
No way! You'll laugh at me!

228
00:10:35,677 --> 00:10:38,555
No, we won't laugh.
It looks great on you.

229
00:10:38,596 --> 00:10:42,225
Y-you really mean it?

230
00:10:44,269 --> 00:10:46,229
She's so cute...

231
00:10:46,271 --> 00:10:47,313
Uh?

232
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:49,107
Hmm...

233
00:10:49,733 --> 00:10:50,859
Hm...

234
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:53,653
Um, Ui, who's this lady?

235
00:10:53,695 --> 00:10:55,530
This is Ms. Yamanaka.

236
00:10:55,572 --> 00:10:58,033
She's their faculty advisor.

237
00:10:58,533 --> 00:10:59,576
You two...

238
00:10:59,617 --> 00:11:00,827
Yes?!

239
00:11:00,869 --> 00:11:02,537
Care to try one?

240
00:11:02,579 --> 00:11:04,372
No thank you.

241
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:08,084
Please consider joining up.

242
00:11:08,126 --> 00:11:10,795
Thank you very much,
we will.

243
00:11:11,588 --> 00:11:13,506
So what did you think?

244
00:11:13,548 --> 00:11:17,427
Well, it didn't quite seem
the same as real jazz,

245
00:11:17,469 --> 00:11:18,678
if you know what I mean.

246
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,513
It didn't, huh?

247
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:23,600
Uh?

248
00:11:23,641 --> 00:11:26,061
Hey, why did you stop?

249
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:28,146
That reminds me...

250
00:11:40,742 --> 00:11:42,369
[Yui]
K-ON!

251
00:11:44,579 --> 00:11:46,498
Wow, they look kinda cool!

252
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:49,250
[Ui]
<i>Now they finally look like</i>
<i>a Light Music Club.</i>

253
00:11:49,292 --> 00:11:52,545
Mio-chan, my strap is
caught on my shoulder.

254
00:11:52,587 --> 00:11:54,089
Yeah, mine is, too.

255
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:56,216
I can't move in this skirt...

256
00:11:57,592 --> 00:11:59,678
Yeah, these sleeves are...

257
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:01,262
No, I guess they're fine.

258
00:12:01,304 --> 00:12:03,390
[Ritsu]
Ah! I can't play like this!

259
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:06,226
[Mio]
Whose bright idea was it
to wear maid outfits?!

260
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:09,562
We decided to change
into track suits.

261
00:12:09,604 --> 00:12:11,564
Okay, here I come!

262
00:12:11,606 --> 00:12:13,108
Ready!

263
00:12:13,858 --> 00:12:15,235
Yea!

264
00:12:15,276 --> 00:12:17,070
Hahaha!

265
00:12:18,029 --> 00:12:20,073
-You're next, Mugi! Go on!
-Right!

266
00:12:20,115 --> 00:12:21,574
What do you think
you're doing?!

267
00:12:21,616 --> 00:12:25,245
Okay, why don't we
get started then.

268
00:12:25,286 --> 00:12:26,621
Hm.

269
00:12:27,789 --> 00:12:28,998
(strum)

270
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,500
That was awesome!

271
00:12:30,542 --> 00:12:33,253
They're cool, but not
those track suits...

272
00:12:33,294 --> 00:12:34,879
[girl]
You're really going?

273
00:12:34,921 --> 00:12:37,340
They were the ones in those
animal costumes, remember?

274
00:12:37,382 --> 00:12:39,300
I'm just gonna take
a quick peek.

275
00:12:39,342 --> 00:12:42,303
(playing "Fuwa Fuwa Time")

276
00:12:42,971 --> 00:12:44,389
[Azusa]
Track suits?

277
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:47,225
[girl]
Hey, isn't that Ui Hirasawa?

278
00:12:47,267 --> 00:12:48,977
She's in our class.

279
00:12:49,019 --> 00:12:51,354
It's almost like she doesn't
want to be there...

280
00:12:51,396 --> 00:12:55,358
[Azusa]
Maybe they don't take things
seriously in this club.

281
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:58,987
[Yui]
Um, we're really sorry
we didn't give you

282
00:12:59,029 --> 00:13:01,114
a full-on proper performance.

283
00:13:01,156 --> 00:13:03,074
We normally go all-out
when we play.

284
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:05,577
-Really, we do that?
-Of course we do!

285
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:07,287
In any event,
we'll be performing

286
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:09,456
four songs tomorrow,
so be sure to come.

287
00:13:09,497 --> 00:13:11,875
We'll want to hear your
unvarnished opinion!

288
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:15,211
Sure, I'll do that...

289
00:13:15,253 --> 00:13:16,838
W-well, I guess we
should get going then.

290
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,507
I'll see you later on
back at home, Big Sis.

291
00:13:19,549 --> 00:13:21,176
Sure thing, Ui.

292
00:13:22,344 --> 00:13:24,137
[Ui]
So, what did you think?

293
00:13:24,179 --> 00:13:28,433
Um, well, they're certainly
incredible in many ways.

294
00:13:28,475 --> 00:13:30,226
You think so?

295
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:34,981
Oh, and that cake we had
was really good!

296
00:13:35,023 --> 00:13:37,484
Yeah, it was, wasn't it?

297
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:39,402
(sighs)

298
00:13:43,865 --> 00:13:45,533
Um, listen, I--

299
00:13:45,575 --> 00:13:47,702
I'm sorry, I have to
go to the bathroom!

300
00:13:47,744 --> 00:13:50,080
Go on without me. 'Bye.

301
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:55,210
Their prospects
are looking grim.

302
00:13:56,461 --> 00:13:57,545
Oh...

303
00:13:59,631 --> 00:14:00,715
Uh...

304
00:14:03,802 --> 00:14:05,136
Uh?

305
00:14:09,557 --> 00:14:11,184
Hmm...

306
00:14:11,226 --> 00:14:13,645
[Yui]
What did she think?
What did she think?

307
00:14:13,687 --> 00:14:16,731
She said she thought
it was incredible.

308
00:14:16,773 --> 00:14:18,274
Wasn't it, though?

309
00:14:18,316 --> 00:14:20,193
She'll come tomorrow,
too, right?

310
00:14:20,235 --> 00:14:22,445
Yeah, probably.

311
00:14:23,738 --> 00:14:26,866
The Light Music Club,
it's really a blast!

312
00:14:26,908 --> 00:14:28,410
Yeah.

313
00:14:30,412 --> 00:14:32,580
(tuning)

314
00:14:38,753 --> 00:14:39,713
Hey, Big Sis?

315
00:14:39,754 --> 00:14:41,131
Yeah?

316
00:14:41,172 --> 00:14:42,716
What do think is
the best thing

317
00:14:42,757 --> 00:14:44,426
about the Light Music Club?

318
00:14:44,467 --> 00:14:45,468
Huh?

319
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:48,096
Well, let me think a second...

320
00:14:48,138 --> 00:14:50,974
I guess it's
how much fun it is.

321
00:14:51,016 --> 00:14:52,475
Fun in what way?

322
00:14:52,517 --> 00:14:56,021
I don't know. Fun is fun.

323
00:14:56,062 --> 00:14:57,397
Do you wanna join, too, Ui?

324
00:14:57,439 --> 00:15:00,734
Our goal is to
play the Budokan!

325
00:15:00,775 --> 00:15:02,777
I'll think about it.

326
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:07,449
<i>Now that I think about it,</i>

327
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:11,327
<i>Sis has been really energetic</i>
<i>ever since she joined the club.</i>

328
00:15:12,203 --> 00:15:13,830
<i>Until a little</i>
<i>while ago, she...</i>

329
00:15:13,872 --> 00:15:16,249
Ui... Ice cream!

330
00:15:16,291 --> 00:15:18,752
Not until after
you've had your dinner!

331
00:15:19,878 --> 00:15:22,213
I want ice cream! Ice cream!

332
00:15:22,255 --> 00:15:26,551
<i>But now, she's really focused</i>
<i>and working hard.</i>

333
00:15:27,802 --> 00:15:28,928
Ui?

334
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:30,096
Yeah, Sis?

335
00:15:30,138 --> 00:15:32,891
I really wanna have ice cream!

336
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:34,267
After you've had your dinner!

337
00:15:34,309 --> 00:15:38,229
<i>In some ways she's the</i>
<i>same as ever, though...</i>

338
00:15:45,612 --> 00:15:47,447
Uh...

339
00:15:47,489 --> 00:15:48,782
It's packed out there!

340
00:15:48,823 --> 00:15:50,909
Well, it is suppose to be
the welcome party

341
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:52,285
for all the new students.

342
00:15:52,327 --> 00:15:54,996
If we play like we always do,
and we'll be fine.

343
00:15:55,038 --> 00:15:56,373
B-b-but we don't...

344
00:15:56,414 --> 00:15:58,625
Your still not over
your stage fright, huh?

345
00:15:58,667 --> 00:15:59,584
Ritchan!

346
00:15:59,626 --> 00:16:01,503
I just found
a one dollar coin!

347
00:16:01,544 --> 00:16:04,005
I wish you would be
more nervous!

348
00:16:04,047 --> 00:16:07,050
[Mio]
The order is: "Fuwa Fuwa Time,"

349
00:16:07,092 --> 00:16:08,385
"Curry, Then Rice,"

350
00:16:08,426 --> 00:16:10,136
"My Love is a Stapler,"

351
00:16:10,178 --> 00:16:13,348
Brush Pen, Ballpoint Pen."

352
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:16,559
Your taste in song titles
is as unique as ever seen.

353
00:16:16,601 --> 00:16:17,936
Really?

354
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:20,480
So, do you really want me to
sing all the vocals today?

355
00:16:20,522 --> 00:16:22,691
That's right, we never
decided on that.

356
00:16:22,732 --> 00:16:24,984
I've got it. Since we are lucky
enough to have two singers,

357
00:16:25,026 --> 00:16:27,987
I think that you should do
at least one song today, Mio.

358
00:16:28,029 --> 00:16:28,905
Huh!

359
00:16:28,947 --> 00:16:30,240
C'mon, high five!

360
00:16:30,281 --> 00:16:32,492
-No way! Forget it! I can't!
-Oh, Mio...

361
00:16:32,534 --> 00:16:34,828
But everybody loved your
singing in our last show.

362
00:16:34,869 --> 00:16:36,329
Forget it!

363
00:16:36,371 --> 00:16:38,206
Come on, accidents like that
don't happen twice.

364
00:16:38,248 --> 00:16:39,499
-No! Ah!
-But, Mio...

365
00:16:39,541 --> 00:16:41,501
-Mio-chan...
-No!

366
00:16:41,543 --> 00:16:42,377
(crying)

367
00:16:42,419 --> 00:16:44,004
-You want ramen?
-No!

368
00:16:44,045 --> 00:16:46,256
-So then, no gyoza?
-No!

369
00:16:47,674 --> 00:16:50,176
Boy, that's one serious
rejection response.

370
00:16:50,218 --> 00:16:51,720
[Yamanaka]
I guess we have no choice.

371
00:16:51,761 --> 00:16:54,431
We'll have to let Yui
handle everything.

372
00:16:54,472 --> 00:16:55,807
[announcer]
Next up is a club introduction

373
00:16:55,849 --> 00:16:58,143
and performance
by the Light Music Club.

374
00:16:58,184 --> 00:16:59,352
Look like we're on!

375
00:16:59,394 --> 00:17:00,854
[Yamanaka]
Break a leg.

376
00:17:00,895 --> 00:17:04,357
And I have just one last word
for you all before I go...

377
00:17:04,399 --> 00:17:05,984
What is it?

378
00:17:06,026 --> 00:17:08,236
Uniforms as costumes are great!

379
00:17:08,278 --> 00:17:12,157
Would you please
clear off the stage now.

380
00:17:12,198 --> 00:17:13,742
[Ui]
Really? You've decided?

381
00:17:13,783 --> 00:17:15,744
[Jun]
Yeah. The Jazz Appreciation Club

382
00:17:15,785 --> 00:17:18,121
has some cool
upperclassmen in it.

383
00:17:18,163 --> 00:17:19,748
I'm sorry.

384
00:17:19,789 --> 00:17:22,083
Well, if that's the club
you want to be in,

385
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:23,376
then that's the club
you should join.

386
00:17:23,418 --> 00:17:25,420
It's your decision after all.

387
00:17:26,338 --> 00:17:27,797
See you.

388
00:17:29,215 --> 00:17:30,884
(sigh)

389
00:17:30,925 --> 00:17:31,801
Hm?

390
00:17:31,843 --> 00:17:33,428
Uh...

391
00:17:34,012 --> 00:17:35,597
Uh, excuse me!

392
00:17:36,723 --> 00:17:38,266
Uh...

393
00:17:39,142 --> 00:17:41,478
(Playing "Curry, Then Rice")

394
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:45,607
Sorry to drag you
in here like this.

395
00:17:45,648 --> 00:17:48,234
Oh! Wow, it really is
packed in here!

396
00:17:48,276 --> 00:17:50,862
Huh? Whoa...

397
00:17:50,904 --> 00:17:53,365
(audience clapping)

398
00:17:55,283 --> 00:18:00,288
<i>Wow, my sister's</i>
<i>on vocals today!</i>

399
00:18:01,289 --> 00:18:02,290
Hi, we're the Light...

400
00:18:02,332 --> 00:18:03,875
(feedback)

401
00:18:03,917 --> 00:18:05,752
...the Light Music Club.

402
00:18:05,794 --> 00:18:08,421
To all you new students
out there,

403
00:18:08,463 --> 00:18:11,466
congratulations on
getting in to our school!

404
00:18:11,508 --> 00:18:14,052
When I first heard about
the Light Music Club,

405
00:18:14,094 --> 00:18:17,263
I thought all they did was
play "lighthearted" music.

406
00:18:17,305 --> 00:18:19,099
(audience laughs)

407
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:22,310
<i>Yui's banter is doing a good</i>
<i>job putting everybody at ease.</i>

408
00:18:22,352 --> 00:18:25,188
I signed up without
giving it much thought,

409
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:27,107
thinking I could
just play castanets

410
00:18:27,148 --> 00:18:28,650
or something simple, like that.

411
00:18:28,692 --> 00:18:30,777
So I hope all of you
think about joining up

412
00:18:30,819 --> 00:18:33,405
with the same
carefree attitude!

413
00:18:35,323 --> 00:18:38,493
But you know, Ms. Yamanaka
told me one day,

414
00:18:38,535 --> 00:18:41,454
that castanets are actually
really hard to play.

415
00:18:41,496 --> 00:18:42,956
Here's our next song.

416
00:18:42,997 --> 00:18:44,082
About time...

417
00:18:44,124 --> 00:18:45,583
Oh, Ms. Yamanaka is our advisor

418
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:47,168
and the music teacher here--

419
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:48,586
(drums playing)

420
00:18:48,628 --> 00:18:50,088
What are we, a comedy band?!

421
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:51,631
Sorry, Ritchan.

422
00:18:51,673 --> 00:18:56,344
Anyway, here's our next song,
"My Love is a Stapler"!

423
00:18:56,386 --> 00:18:58,513
(playing "My Love is a Stapler")

424
00:19:05,687 --> 00:19:08,189
<i>That riff is tough, and she's</i>
<i>pulling it off perfectly!</i>

425
00:19:08,231 --> 00:19:09,232
<i>Except for...</i>

426
00:19:09,274 --> 00:19:10,400
Yui, sing!

427
00:19:10,442 --> 00:19:12,777
<i>Ah! I forgot the lyrics!</i>

428
00:19:22,829 --> 00:19:24,205
{\an8}<i>Ah! Uh...!</i>

429
00:19:24,247 --> 00:19:25,248
{\an8}<i>Mio-chan...</i>

430
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:27,542
{\an8}<i>Hurry up and sing!</i>

431
00:20:33,108 --> 00:20:35,610
{\an8}<i>*</i>

432
00:21:07,392 --> 00:21:09,519
(groaning)

433
00:21:09,561 --> 00:21:11,521
[Mugi]
Um, excuse me girls...

434
00:21:11,563 --> 00:21:13,023
You know, no one
is going to come in

435
00:21:13,064 --> 00:21:14,691
with you glaring out
the door like that.

436
00:21:14,733 --> 00:21:18,486
[Yui]
Aw, but the crowd at our show
was so psyched about us!

437
00:21:18,528 --> 00:21:20,739
[Ritsu]
Impossible, not a
single person showed up!

438
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:24,534
[Yui]
Oh! You don't think it's because
of the way I messed up, do you?

439
00:21:24,576 --> 00:21:26,036
You know, maybe it's because

440
00:21:26,077 --> 00:21:28,455
we have such a low
membership in our club.

441
00:21:28,496 --> 00:21:29,914
(sigh)

442
00:21:29,956 --> 00:21:32,208
Come on now,
the tea is ready!

443
00:21:33,626 --> 00:21:36,963
I suppose we're just gonna
have to go and nab up Ui.

444
00:21:37,005 --> 00:21:39,257
The poor girl isn't a bug.

445
00:21:39,299 --> 00:21:40,550
(door opens)

446
00:21:40,592 --> 00:21:42,844
Pardon me...

447
00:21:44,429 --> 00:21:45,722
Uh, yes?

448
00:21:45,764 --> 00:21:49,309
I'm very interested in
joining your club.

449
00:21:51,102 --> 00:21:53,063
Um, would you mind
repeating that?

450
00:21:53,104 --> 00:21:55,482
I'd like to join the club.

451
00:21:55,523 --> 00:21:57,233
Ah!

452
00:21:59,027 --> 00:22:01,363
[Ritsu]
We got one!

453
00:22:01,404 --> 00:22:04,824
Ahh!

454
00:22:04,866 --> 00:22:08,078
Good for you, Big Sis!

455
00:22:17,754 --> 00:22:20,006
("Don't say 'lazy'" plays)

456
00:23:51,222 --> 00:23:53,016
[Azusa]
Um, what's this?

457
00:23:53,058 --> 00:23:55,143
[Yamanaka]
It's a pair of cat ears,
obviously.

458
00:23:55,185 --> 00:23:57,479
No, I knew that,
but, uh...

459
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:00,565
What am I supposed
to do with them?

460
00:24:00,607 --> 00:24:04,986
<i>I wonder if they're testing me</i>
<i>to see how independent I am?</i>

461
00:24:05,028 --> 00:24:07,697
[Yui]
Okay, it's your turn
next, Azusa-chan.

462
00:24:07,739 --> 00:24:11,993
Um, my name's Azusa Nakano,
Year 1, Class 2.

463
00:24:12,035 --> 00:24:14,579
I look forward to
our time together.
