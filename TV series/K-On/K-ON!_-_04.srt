1
00:00:03,378 --> 00:00:05,088
[Yui]
It's summer!

2
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:07,298
[Ritsu]
It's the beach!

3
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:09,759
Oh!

4
00:00:11,886 --> 00:00:13,346
[Mio]
It's so pretty...

5
00:00:13,388 --> 00:00:15,473
[Mugi]
It's sparkling!

6
00:00:17,892 --> 00:00:20,770
Ready, let's swim!

7
00:00:20,812 --> 00:00:22,355
Yeah!

8
00:00:22,397 --> 00:00:26,609
You guys, be careful and
don't get carried away, okay!

9
00:00:27,819 --> 00:00:29,195
Bleh!

10
00:00:29,904 --> 00:00:31,948
Yui, the water's all salty!

11
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:34,993
Because it's saltwater, Ritchan!

12
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:37,037
Yui, there are waves here!

13
00:00:37,078 --> 00:00:38,663
There are waves, Ritchan!

14
00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:42,667
They're not listening to
a word I said...

15
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:44,836
("Cagayake! Girls" plays)

16
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:19,264
(Camera clicks)

17
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:25,103
Hm?

18
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:27,522
Light Music Club?

19
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:34,612
Sakura High Festival?

20
00:02:34,654 --> 00:02:36,823
{\an8}*

21
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:43,121
(Nervous)

22
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:45,206
Let's see...

23
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:46,207
(Strum)

24
00:02:46,249 --> 00:02:49,627
Ow! My finger!

25
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:51,796
You really did forgot
how to play.

26
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:52,672
Huh?

27
00:02:52,714 --> 00:02:54,132
(Giggles)

28
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:56,217
My grandma used to
compliment me all the time.

29
00:02:56,259 --> 00:02:58,470
"Yui," she said, "as soon
as you learn one thing,

30
00:02:58,511 --> 00:03:00,221
everything else seems to
leave your head."

31
00:03:00,263 --> 00:03:02,515
I don't think that
was a compliment.

32
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,143
Oh, Mio!

33
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:06,770
Where have you been?

34
00:03:06,811 --> 00:03:07,854
Huh?

35
00:03:11,107 --> 00:03:12,901
We're having a training camp!

36
00:03:12,942 --> 00:03:14,277
Training camp?

37
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,488
That's right.
Summer vacation is almost here.

38
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:19,449
We're going to the beach?
Or maybe to the mountains?!

39
00:03:19,491 --> 00:03:21,493
We're not going out there
to play around!

40
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:23,495
This will be a
band training camp!

41
00:03:23,536 --> 00:03:26,289
We'll be practicing nonstop
from sunup to sundown!

42
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:28,750
I'd better buy
new clothes to wear!

43
00:03:28,792 --> 00:03:31,252
Yeah, I need to buy
a swimsuit, too.

44
00:03:31,294 --> 00:03:33,713
Listen!

45
00:03:33,755 --> 00:03:35,340
Pretty soon after the
end of summer vacation,

46
00:03:35,382 --> 00:03:37,008
is the high school festival.

47
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:38,510
"High School festival."

48
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:41,721
Yes! In the past, the Light
Music Club was pretty famous

49
00:03:41,763 --> 00:03:45,266
for its live performances
at the Sakura High Festival.

50
00:03:45,308 --> 00:03:46,893
That festival is-

51
00:03:46,935 --> 00:03:48,687
Wow, the school festival!

52
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:52,023
School festivals at high schools
are pretty elaborate, right?

53
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:53,274
Concessions!

54
00:03:53,316 --> 00:03:54,109
Yakisoba!

55
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:55,068
Takoyaki!

56
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:56,861
(Giggles)

57
00:03:56,903 --> 00:04:00,448
I know! I really want to
have a full-on maid caf¨¦!

58
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:03,868
A-A haunted house
would be a lot better!

59
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:05,036
A maid caf¨¦!

60
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:06,162
A haunted house!

61
00:04:06,204 --> 00:04:07,539
A maid caf¨¦!

62
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:08,748
I said, a haunted house!

63
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:11,376
No! A maid caf¨¦ is
the way to go!

64
00:04:11,418 --> 00:04:12,836
(Whack)
Ah!

65
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:16,423
Hmph! How come
you only whack me?

66
00:04:16,464 --> 00:04:18,383
We're the Light Music Club,
aren't we?

67
00:04:18,425 --> 00:04:21,136
WE are performing!

68
00:04:21,177 --> 00:04:23,221
Hello, everyone.
Sorry I'm late.

69
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:24,639
Huh?

70
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:27,058
Ow... ow...

71
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:30,437
Would you like
some madeleines?

72
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:31,563
[Mugi]
Goodness...

73
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:33,231
[Mio]
What do you think, Mugi?

74
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:34,524
I know at the beginning

75
00:04:34,566 --> 00:04:35,984
I said we should
take things slowly,

76
00:04:36,026 --> 00:04:37,944
but I mean, come on.
It's been three months now,

77
00:04:37,986 --> 00:04:40,488
and we haven't played
together a single time.

78
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:42,949
[Mugi]
Now, now, now, now, now, now...

79
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:44,284
Six times.

80
00:04:44,325 --> 00:04:45,410
What?

81
00:04:45,452 --> 00:04:47,704
Oh! Yeah, definitely!
Let's go!

82
00:04:47,746 --> 00:04:51,249
I've always dreamed of having
a sleepover with you all.

83
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:52,625
Really, you have?

84
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:54,961
So, should we go to the beach?
Or how about-

85
00:04:55,003 --> 00:04:58,798
I told you, this is going to be
a training camp for the band!

86
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,258
(Nervous laugh)

87
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:03,887
Uh, how much is this
training camp going to cost?

88
00:05:03,928 --> 00:05:05,180
You know, she right.

89
00:05:05,221 --> 00:05:06,598
We're on a tight budget?

90
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:09,351
I hadn't thought of that...

91
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:11,102
Hey, Mugi?

92
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:12,270
Yes?

93
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:14,147
Do you have a summer house?

94
00:05:14,189 --> 00:05:15,023
Yes, of course.

95
00:05:15,065 --> 00:05:16,107
Oh!

96
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:18,068
<i>Of course she does!</i>

97
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:22,530
Sis?

98
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:24,949
Come on, Sis!

99
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:26,534
(Snoring)

100
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:28,661
How about getting
out of bed all ready?

101
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:30,288
And aren't those my pajamas?

102
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:33,375
(Sleepy groan)
A little longer, please...

103
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:35,502
You're just hopeless.

104
00:05:38,046 --> 00:05:39,422
Huh?

105
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:44,427
Um, Big Sister?

106
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,932
What time is it?!

107
00:05:48,973 --> 00:05:50,517
Um... Uh...

108
00:05:50,558 --> 00:05:55,021
(Phone rings)

109
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:58,024
Hello.

110
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:01,152
[Mio]
Good morning.

111
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:03,321
A fine morning
to you, too.

112
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:06,866
(Train horn)
[Yui] I'm sorry!

113
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:09,411
(Sigh)

114
00:06:09,452 --> 00:06:11,162
Boy, I can't believe
I made it...

115
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:14,249
Yeah, and after we warned you
not to oversleep, too.

116
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:17,711
Sorry, I was way too excited
to get a good night's sleep.

117
00:06:17,752 --> 00:06:20,213
What are you,
a grade-schooler?

118
00:06:20,255 --> 00:06:21,631
(Giggles)

119
00:06:21,673 --> 00:06:25,093
Yeah, well, seems she's
not the only one.

120
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:30,557
She's asleep.

121
00:06:30,598 --> 00:06:33,101
Well, she did say that
this was her dream.

122
00:06:33,143 --> 00:06:37,063
(Soft giggle)

123
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:38,732
The gel type will be fine...

124
00:06:38,773 --> 00:06:40,066
Gel!

125
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:42,027
Hey, I wonder what she's
dreaming about right now?

126
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:45,488
You know, I think we need to
get a picture of this.

127
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:48,074
Cut it out,
that'd be really mean!

128
00:06:48,116 --> 00:06:49,909
It's for our memory album!

129
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:52,495
(Click)

130
00:06:52,537 --> 00:06:55,498
(Waking sounds)

131
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:57,375
Oh, I'm so sorry.

132
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:59,210
You see, you woke her up.

133
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:00,962
I'm sorry about that!

134
00:07:01,004 --> 00:07:03,465
So now that our awake,
you really gotta tell us.

135
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:05,884
Where's this cool
summer home of yours?

136
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:07,594
Ah!

137
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:10,180
Let's see...

138
00:07:13,058 --> 00:07:14,642
Almost there.

139
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:17,771
Ah!

140
00:07:17,812 --> 00:07:18,980
Wow!

141
00:07:19,022 --> 00:07:20,940
(Seagull cries)

142
00:07:23,526 --> 00:07:25,236
The beach?

143
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:27,197
Yes, the beach.

144
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:30,575
Yui!

145
00:07:33,536 --> 00:07:35,413
Ready, and...

146
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:36,247
Pull!

147
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:38,124
(Excited)

148
00:07:38,917 --> 00:07:41,086
[Yui]
Smell that salty air!

149
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:42,754
Swimming! Yeah!

150
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:46,049
I told you, we didn't
come here to play!

151
00:07:46,091 --> 00:07:48,009
[Yui and Ritsu]
Yeah!

152
00:07:48,051 --> 00:07:49,219
(Mugi giggles)

153
00:08:02,857 --> 00:08:04,317
[Ritsu]
It's huge!

154
00:08:04,359 --> 00:08:05,610
Oh!

155
00:08:05,652 --> 00:08:07,153
To be honest,

156
00:08:07,195 --> 00:08:09,698
I had hoped to stay in one of
our larger vacation houses,

157
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:11,032
but unfortunately,

158
00:08:11,074 --> 00:08:13,451
I only got permission
to borrow our smallest.

159
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:15,787
This is your smallest house?

160
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:17,163
This...

161
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:21,876
(Excited laugher)

162
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:24,963
Wow! Look at all this space!

163
00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:26,881
This is amazing!

164
00:08:28,383 --> 00:08:29,467
Huh?

165
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:30,635
What's this?

166
00:08:30,677 --> 00:08:32,303
Oh my, I'm sorry!

167
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:35,140
I said they didn't need to
leave anything out for us,

168
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:36,349
but I guess they did.

169
00:08:36,391 --> 00:08:38,226
Mugi, what's in here?!

170
00:08:38,268 --> 00:08:39,728
Oh!

171
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:42,188
Oh, it's a princess bed!

172
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:44,983
Whoa!

173
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:47,402
Look at that!

174
00:08:47,444 --> 00:08:48,987
I'm so sorry!

175
00:08:49,029 --> 00:08:51,573
I always tell them
I'd like things to be

176
00:08:51,614 --> 00:08:53,283
as normal as possible.

177
00:08:53,324 --> 00:08:56,703
They just don't seem to
understand what that means.

178
00:08:57,954 --> 00:08:59,205
Come in.

179
00:09:02,334 --> 00:09:03,710
It hasn't been used recently,

180
00:09:03,752 --> 00:09:06,921
so I'm worried that the gear
might not work properly.

181
00:09:08,465 --> 00:09:11,009
Well, everything looks okay!

182
00:09:11,926 --> 00:09:14,012
Hey, where are Yui and Ritsu?

183
00:09:14,054 --> 00:09:16,723
I don't know.
They wandered off at some point.

184
00:09:16,765 --> 00:09:19,059
Those two are hopeless.

185
00:09:23,021 --> 00:09:23,772
What's that?

186
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:26,149
Oh, you mean this?

187
00:09:28,485 --> 00:09:32,864
(Girls singing rock)

188
00:09:32,906 --> 00:09:36,785
It's a past Light Music Club
playing at the school festival.

189
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:39,704
I found it in
the clubroom earlier.

190
00:09:39,746 --> 00:09:41,539
They're good.

191
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:44,751
Yeah, they're way, way
better than we are.

192
00:09:45,168 --> 00:09:46,086
Yes.

193
00:09:46,127 --> 00:09:47,545
When I heard this,

194
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:50,173
it's like I had this sudden urge
not to be outdone by them.

195
00:09:50,215 --> 00:09:54,719
So is that why you suggested
this training camp.

196
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:57,597
Yeah. But we're...

197
00:09:59,349 --> 00:10:01,267
I don't think we will.

198
00:10:03,311 --> 00:10:05,271
I know we can do this.

199
00:10:07,107 --> 00:10:07,857
Mugi-

200
00:10:07,899 --> 00:10:10,110
Yeah! Time for some fun!

201
00:10:10,151 --> 00:10:11,569
Oh, yeah!

202
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:13,738
Well, that was fast!
What about practice?!

203
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:14,906
We're gonna go on ahead,

204
00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:17,283
so you two hurry up
and get changed!

205
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:19,577
You still sure?

206
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:21,287
Y-yes, I think.

207
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:22,539
[Ritsu]
Hey!

208
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:24,666
[Yui]
Hurry up!

209
00:10:24,708 --> 00:10:26,918
Wait, I'll be right there!

210
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,837
Come on, Mio, shall we?

211
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:30,422
Wait! You mean you're
gonna go with them?

212
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:34,050
We may as well enjoy ourselves
a little while we're here.

213
00:10:34,092 --> 00:10:35,051
Right?

214
00:10:35,093 --> 00:10:36,261
Uh...

215
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:37,721
But I thought we'd...

216
00:10:37,762 --> 00:10:40,682
Mugi, we're going!

217
00:10:40,724 --> 00:10:41,933
Coming!

218
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:44,310
We'll all be waiting for you.

219
00:10:54,571 --> 00:10:58,241
(Upset grunt)

220
00:10:59,534 --> 00:11:02,829
Wait for me!
I'm going, too!

221
00:11:06,374 --> 00:11:08,126
{\an8}*

222
00:11:09,461 --> 00:11:10,962
[Yui]
K-ON!

223
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:15,258
[Yui]
It's been two weeks since we
tragically washed ashore

224
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:16,593
on this desert island...

225
00:11:16,634 --> 00:11:19,763
Yes, although I thought
we were done for

226
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:21,431
when we were
cast adrift at sea.

227
00:11:21,473 --> 00:11:25,185
Still, you gotta admit, this is
kinda fun in its own way.

228
00:11:27,187 --> 00:11:29,647
What a grand find...

229
00:11:33,068 --> 00:11:35,695
Seems we're saved...
Tonight we feast-

230
00:11:35,737 --> 00:11:38,156
What kind of crazy scenario
are you acting out?

231
00:11:40,742 --> 00:11:42,660
Mio, you're...

232
00:11:44,662 --> 00:11:46,915
Eat this!

233
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:48,583
Come on, Yui! Let's swim!

234
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:49,376
Right!

235
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:50,251
(Grunt)

236
00:11:50,293 --> 00:11:52,295
(Steps walking away)

237
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:54,422
That hurt.

238
00:11:55,507 --> 00:11:57,175
Then again...

239
00:11:59,177 --> 00:12:01,971
This sure is a pretty place.

240
00:12:03,348 --> 00:12:04,974
(Laughing)

241
00:12:05,016 --> 00:12:07,686
C'mon, tell me,
what did you draw?

242
00:12:12,232 --> 00:12:15,068
It just grew to this size
before I knew it.

243
00:12:17,612 --> 00:12:19,239
(Laughing)

244
00:12:24,327 --> 00:12:27,497
I'm not scared, I'm not scared,
I'm not scared...

245
00:12:27,539 --> 00:12:28,998
When you go to the doctor,

246
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,376
your kneecaps will be
covered with barnacles.

247
00:12:31,418 --> 00:12:32,419
Ah!

248
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:33,712
(Laughing)

249
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:35,213
(Laughing)

250
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:41,636
Ahh!

251
00:12:41,678 --> 00:12:43,304
I swallowed
seawater!

252
00:12:43,346 --> 00:12:46,683
We've made it at last to the
golden island of Zipangu!

253
00:12:46,725 --> 00:12:48,184
The day's not over yet.

254
00:12:48,226 --> 00:12:49,894
Huh? When did you get that?

255
00:12:49,936 --> 00:12:52,564
We're at the beach and all.
And it's a beautiful day.

256
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:53,940
And if we don't live it up,

257
00:12:53,982 --> 00:12:56,443
what was the point of
coming all this way and...

258
00:12:57,277 --> 00:12:58,153
Wah!

259
00:12:58,194 --> 00:12:59,112
Practice!

260
00:12:59,154 --> 00:13:01,031
What, you forgot
about that?

261
00:13:01,072 --> 00:13:02,991
It's all your fault, Ritsu,

262
00:13:03,033 --> 00:13:04,951
with your going on and on
about goofing off.

263
00:13:04,993 --> 00:13:09,122
Oh, yeah? Well which of us
was having the most fun, huh?

264
00:13:09,164 --> 00:13:10,749
Uh...

265
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:13,293
[Ritsu] (Full belly groans)

266
00:13:13,335 --> 00:13:14,669
I'm so stuffed!

267
00:13:14,711 --> 00:13:19,049
Ah... The floor feels
wonderfully nice and cool.

268
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:20,759
When you close your eyes,

269
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,053
it almost feels like you're
being carried far away

270
00:13:23,094 --> 00:13:26,014
out to sea by the
ocean waves, doesn't it?

271
00:13:26,973 --> 00:13:29,017
Hey, you're right it does...

272
00:13:29,059 --> 00:13:30,560
Good night, Ritchan.

273
00:13:30,602 --> 00:13:31,728
Yeah, you, too.

274
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:33,646
Hey, come on, guys,
we're starting!

275
00:13:33,688 --> 00:13:35,315
You need to
get up, you two!

276
00:13:35,357 --> 00:13:36,441
(Sighs)

277
00:13:38,193 --> 00:13:40,904
Hey, Mugi, stand back
for a minute.

278
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:48,787
(Heavy bass note)

279
00:13:49,788 --> 00:13:51,081
(Groans)

280
00:13:51,122 --> 00:13:53,249
(Tuning up)
(Ritsu and Yui tired groans)

281
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:56,419
Oh, c'mon, can't we
just call it a day.

282
00:13:56,461 --> 00:13:59,130
We came here to practice, and
so that's what we're gonna do!

283
00:13:59,172 --> 00:14:01,800
Yeah, but we're tired.

284
00:14:03,093 --> 00:14:04,427
I've been meaning to ask,

285
00:14:04,469 --> 00:14:06,638
have you been putting on
a bit of weight lately?

286
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:07,889
Oh!

287
00:14:07,931 --> 00:14:09,808
Especially around
your mid-section.

288
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:10,767
Huh?!

289
00:14:10,809 --> 00:14:12,227
Maybe it's because

290
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:14,270
you haven't been playing
the drums lately?

291
00:14:14,312 --> 00:14:15,814
Ah! Ah! Ah!

292
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:18,108
I can't hold this any longer.

293
00:14:18,149 --> 00:14:20,944
Aw, this guitar feels like
it weighs a ton!

294
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:22,862
That's why I told you
before bought it

295
00:14:22,904 --> 00:14:24,781
that you should
get a lighter one!

296
00:14:24,823 --> 00:14:27,325
Who was it that told me
to buy this guitar?

297
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:28,576
You did!

298
00:14:29,911 --> 00:14:32,414
The floor's warmed up.
It's not as comfortable.

299
00:14:32,455 --> 00:14:33,957
Yeah...

300
00:14:35,417 --> 00:14:38,253
Roll... roll... roll...

301
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:40,088
Careful,
you'll get dirty.

302
00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:42,465
Yeah, this spot's
nice and cool...

303
00:14:42,507 --> 00:14:44,676
How do you expect to play
in the school festival

304
00:14:44,718 --> 00:14:46,302
if you don't practice?

305
00:14:46,344 --> 00:14:49,264
[Ritsu]
Oh, come on, I told you that
we should do a maid caf¨¦!

306
00:14:49,305 --> 00:14:52,058
[Yui]
I still think we should
do a haunted house!

307
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:55,979
Ugh... Yui, you're not
following me at all.

308
00:14:56,021 --> 00:14:57,772
Look closely at Mio.

309
00:14:57,814 --> 00:15:00,150
Wh-what's this
got to do with me?

310
00:15:00,191 --> 00:15:02,318
Let's face it, Mio. There aren't
many people in this world

311
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:04,487
better suited to the
maid look than you.

312
00:15:04,529 --> 00:15:06,031
Black stockings!

313
00:15:06,072 --> 00:15:07,907
A lily-white apron!

314
00:15:07,949 --> 00:15:11,244
And a maid headband!

315
00:15:11,286 --> 00:15:14,664
The adorable power
of cute compels you!

316
00:15:14,706 --> 00:15:15,999
Love!

317
00:15:16,041 --> 00:15:18,126
And she'd have a
catchphrase like that!

318
00:15:18,168 --> 00:15:20,003
That might be really cute!

319
00:15:20,045 --> 00:15:21,880
Just kidding, relax-

320
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:23,965
(Thud)

321
00:15:24,007 --> 00:15:26,551
<i>[Yui]</i>
<i>S-Squad Member Ritsu...</i>

322
00:15:30,555 --> 00:15:31,848
When we're done with this,

323
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:33,933
we're really gonna start
practicing, got it?

324
00:15:34,517 --> 00:15:36,478
We know, we know!

325
00:15:40,565 --> 00:15:42,233
One, two!

326
00:15:47,364 --> 00:15:49,532
And now for our last number!

327
00:15:49,574 --> 00:15:51,034
Let's do it!

328
00:15:51,076 --> 00:15:54,537
*(Soft melody playing)*

329
00:16:22,941 --> 00:16:24,943
Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!

330
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:27,570
Huh? Wait! It's over already?

331
00:16:27,612 --> 00:16:28,905
Budget issues.

332
00:16:28,947 --> 00:16:32,075
We'll do it again, soon.

333
00:16:32,117 --> 00:16:34,244
Yeah, they'll be
going off like crazy

334
00:16:34,285 --> 00:16:36,496
at our Budokan show, right!

335
00:16:36,538 --> 00:16:37,956
Budokan show?

336
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:41,376
Huh? That's what we all settled
on as our goal, remember?

337
00:16:43,795 --> 00:16:44,754
Right?

338
00:16:44,796 --> 00:16:46,297
Huh?

339
00:16:57,809 --> 00:17:00,186
[Yui]
In that case, I want
the fireworks to be pink!

340
00:17:00,228 --> 00:17:01,980
[Ritsu]
Are you a grade-schooler?

341
00:17:02,022 --> 00:17:03,857
Oh, but it'd be cute!

342
00:17:03,898 --> 00:17:05,442
We'd look like
a bunch of kids!

343
00:17:05,483 --> 00:17:07,777
[Mugi]
I think pink would be
a little much, too.

344
00:17:07,819 --> 00:17:10,447
Aw, you really think so?

345
00:17:10,488 --> 00:17:11,364
(Nervous laugh)

346
00:17:11,406 --> 00:17:13,533
(Rock music playing)
Huh?

347
00:17:13,575 --> 00:17:16,202
If want we're to do is
try to play at the Budokan,

348
00:17:16,244 --> 00:17:18,413
then we need to get
at least as good as this.

349
00:17:18,455 --> 00:17:20,957
[Ritsu]
Wow, they're good.

350
00:17:20,999 --> 00:17:24,252
[Yui]
Huh? I think I could
play this song...

351
00:17:27,088 --> 00:17:30,342
(Scary girl on tape)
<i>I've been waiting</i>
<i>for you people to arrive...</i>

352
00:17:30,383 --> 00:17:30,967
Uh...?

353
00:17:31,009 --> 00:17:33,553
<i>NOW DIE!</i>

354
00:17:35,972 --> 00:17:37,265
What was that?

355
00:17:37,307 --> 00:17:40,018
The tape must have
switched to side B.

356
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:42,937
Oh, right...

357
00:17:42,979 --> 00:17:46,191
I'm not listening,
I'm not listening...

358
00:17:46,232 --> 00:17:47,734
Scary ghosts...

359
00:17:47,776 --> 00:17:49,736
in a scary
haunted house.

360
00:17:49,778 --> 00:17:52,655
Stop it, please!

361
00:17:52,697 --> 00:17:54,366
No more!

362
00:17:54,407 --> 00:17:56,618
Please...

363
00:17:56,659 --> 00:17:59,704
(Crying)

364
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,166
Ritsu.

365
00:18:03,208 --> 00:18:04,834
You overdid it.

366
00:18:04,876 --> 00:18:06,878
Hm...

367
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:09,381
Mio, I'm sorry.

368
00:18:09,422 --> 00:18:11,383
I shouldn't have done that.

369
00:18:11,424 --> 00:18:13,885
You see, Mio?
Everything's okay, now.

370
00:18:13,927 --> 00:18:16,388
It wasn't a ghost
on the tape.

371
00:18:19,432 --> 00:18:20,183
Really?

372
00:18:20,225 --> 00:18:22,352
<i>Sparkly!</i>

373
00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:28,441
The power of cute compels you!

374
00:18:32,195 --> 00:18:33,613
(Waves washing)

375
00:18:33,655 --> 00:18:34,656
(Sniff)

376
00:18:34,698 --> 00:18:36,533
I'm really sorry.

377
00:18:36,574 --> 00:18:37,659
Hm.

378
00:18:37,701 --> 00:18:38,535
Uh...

379
00:18:38,576 --> 00:18:39,869
Hey, Yui,

380
00:18:39,911 --> 00:18:42,122
did you really mean what
you said about that song...

381
00:18:42,163 --> 00:18:44,499
Yeah, watch this!

382
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,835
Let's see...

383
00:18:46,876 --> 00:18:49,546
(Plays melody from tape)

384
00:18:49,587 --> 00:18:51,131
Oh...

385
00:18:54,884 --> 00:18:56,386
No way.

386
00:19:01,766 --> 00:19:03,893
There! How was it?

387
00:19:03,935 --> 00:19:05,979
Wow, that was perfect!

388
00:19:06,021 --> 00:19:07,355
(Giggles)

389
00:19:07,397 --> 00:19:08,690
Thanks, but not quite,

390
00:19:08,732 --> 00:19:10,734
I don't know how to
make it go "myon"...

391
00:19:10,775 --> 00:19:12,277
"Myon"?

392
00:19:12,318 --> 00:19:14,946
Wait a minute, I think you must
be talking about choking.

393
00:19:14,988 --> 00:19:17,240
This choking?
Guess again.

394
00:19:17,282 --> 00:19:19,451
Choking is when you pull on
the strings to bend them

395
00:19:19,492 --> 00:19:22,370
and change the sound while
a note is being playing.

396
00:19:22,412 --> 00:19:24,205
[strum]

397
00:19:24,247 --> 00:19:25,832
You do it like this...

398
00:19:25,874 --> 00:19:27,042
[strum]
Oh, wow!

399
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:28,501
See?

400
00:19:29,127 --> 00:19:31,046
Do this...

401
00:19:31,087 --> 00:19:32,756
and this?

402
00:19:33,631 --> 00:19:35,759
Yeah, that!

403
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:38,762
(Yui giggles)

404
00:19:41,181 --> 00:19:43,058
(Laughing)

405
00:19:43,099 --> 00:19:44,684
That sounds funny!

406
00:19:44,726 --> 00:19:46,227
Uh, funny how?

407
00:19:46,269 --> 00:19:48,563
Look a spook
afraid of ghosts.

408
00:19:48,605 --> 00:19:49,606
Ghosts!

409
00:19:54,986 --> 00:19:59,574
Ah! I can't believe you
even have an outdoor bath.

410
00:19:59,616 --> 00:20:02,535
I certainly had
a lot of fun toady.

411
00:20:02,577 --> 00:20:04,954
Yeah.

412
00:20:04,996 --> 00:20:06,289
Maybe you were right, Mugi.

413
00:20:06,331 --> 00:20:08,041
Maybe I should just
try to relax a bit

414
00:20:08,083 --> 00:20:10,960
and not worry so much.

415
00:20:11,002 --> 00:20:12,629
Then we should've
had a lot more fun!

416
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:13,797
Who are you?!

417
00:20:13,838 --> 00:20:15,298
It's Ritsu!

418
00:20:16,091 --> 00:20:17,884
Wow, your bangs are long...

419
00:20:17,926 --> 00:20:19,219
Got a problem with that?

420
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:21,221
They're long,
but surprisingly cute.

421
00:20:21,262 --> 00:20:23,223
Oh, thanks! Wait, a second.

422
00:20:23,264 --> 00:20:25,016
What do you mean by
"surprisingly"?

423
00:20:25,058 --> 00:20:27,560
Oh, I'm sorry!

424
00:20:27,602 --> 00:20:28,478
Hm...

425
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:31,106
I think you're
trying for this.

426
00:20:31,147 --> 00:20:33,858
Wow! You can tell?
Amazing!

427
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:37,696
Now, all you need to do is
stick out your ring finger.

428
00:20:37,737 --> 00:20:39,698
Oh, I get it!

429
00:20:40,156 --> 00:20:41,032
Ugh!

430
00:20:41,074 --> 00:20:42,784
A-are you all right?

431
00:20:42,826 --> 00:20:44,661
Ow, ow...

432
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:48,164
(Giggles)

433
00:20:48,206 --> 00:20:50,625
Music is a wonderful
thing, isn't it?

434
00:20:50,667 --> 00:20:52,627
It was so much fun
playing together

435
00:20:52,669 --> 00:20:55,714
with everybody,
for the first time today.

436
00:20:56,715 --> 00:20:58,550
Yui...

437
00:20:58,591 --> 00:20:59,926
And I would've missed out on it

438
00:20:59,968 --> 00:21:02,220
if you hadn't suggested
having a training camp.

439
00:21:02,262 --> 00:21:03,888
Thanks, Mio-chan!

440
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:04,931
Uh...

441
00:21:04,973 --> 00:21:07,642
Uh, well...

442
00:21:07,684 --> 00:21:09,769
It looks like Mio's
all embarrassed!

443
00:21:09,811 --> 00:21:12,397
I am not! I'm red from
the heat, and that's all!

444
00:21:12,439 --> 00:21:13,898
[Ritsu]
You're not fooling anyone.

445
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:16,651
[Mio]
You're wrong, all right!
So just drop it!

446
00:21:16,693 --> 00:21:18,695
Uh-oh, Mio's mad!

447
00:21:18,737 --> 00:21:19,821
Why, you...!

448
00:21:19,863 --> 00:21:21,156
Come back here, darn it!

449
00:21:21,197 --> 00:21:22,741
Ooo, scary!
(laughing)

450
00:21:22,782 --> 00:21:24,367
Come back here!

451
00:21:28,872 --> 00:21:30,331
[Ritsu]
Is anyone home?

452
00:21:30,373 --> 00:21:33,335
Coming! I'll be right there!

453
00:21:33,376 --> 00:21:36,004
So you said the pictures from
the training camp are ready?

454
00:21:36,046 --> 00:21:38,173
Yep. Right here.

455
00:21:38,214 --> 00:21:39,799
Ah! Wow!

456
00:21:41,384 --> 00:21:43,386
Ah! Hehehe..

457
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:45,430
Ah!

458
00:21:46,389 --> 00:21:49,017
Haha! That one turned out great.

459
00:21:49,059 --> 00:21:50,727
Actually, I have that shot-

460
00:21:50,769 --> 00:21:51,978
(Choking)

461
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:53,813
Hand over the negatives, now.

462
00:21:53,855 --> 00:21:58,360
I-it's a digital camera,
there's no negatives...

463
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:09,579
[Ritsu]
Come on, Mio, we're starting!

464
00:22:09,621 --> 00:22:12,957
Yeah, hang on!
I'll just be a minute!

465
00:22:20,382 --> 00:22:22,509
("Don't say 'lazy'" plays)

466
00:23:55,018 --> 00:23:58,480
[Nodoka]
Hm, I don't see it
listed anywhere.

467
00:23:58,521 --> 00:24:00,940
Oh, no! You're kidding...

468
00:24:00,982 --> 00:24:02,525
Wait, don't tell me...

469
00:24:02,567 --> 00:24:04,986
Ms. Yamanaka, did you
use to play guitar?

470
00:24:05,028 --> 00:24:07,822
[Yamanaka]
No, but some old friends
of mine did.

471
00:24:07,864 --> 00:24:11,493
[Ritsu]
This was in that cardboard box
you found the other day, Mio.

472
00:24:11,534 --> 00:24:13,828
They look like pictures of
an old Light Music Club.

473
00:24:13,870 --> 00:24:16,623
That's amazing! I knew you
could do it, Nodoka!

474
00:24:16,664 --> 00:24:18,291
Who's your advisor?

475
00:24:18,333 --> 00:24:20,543
Advisor?
