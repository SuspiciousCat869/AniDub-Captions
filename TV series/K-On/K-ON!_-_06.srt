One, two, three, four!

(Excited crowds)

5
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:16,803
Today is the big day...

6
00:02:19,305 --> 00:02:22,517
I wonder if Yui and the others
are here already?

7
00:02:23,184 --> 00:02:24,853
Sorry I'm--

*

00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,822
[Husky voice]
Step right up, step right up!

10
00:02:35,864 --> 00:02:37,407
It's a bargain, it's a bargain!

11
00:02:37,449 --> 00:02:40,410
Wait, that voice...

12
00:02:40,452 --> 00:02:43,038
Right, serving for one.

13
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:44,039
Enjoy.

14
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,165
Thanks, young lady.

15
00:02:45,206 --> 00:02:46,374
Thanks!

16
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:47,876
Geez, Yui!
What are you doing?

17
00:02:47,917 --> 00:02:49,794
Mio! Want some yakisoba?

18
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:50,837
It'll just be a minute!

19
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:52,464
Why is this happening?

20
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:54,174
We perform today!

21
00:02:54,215 --> 00:02:55,717
We don't have time
to mess around.

22
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:58,094
We have to get together
and practice like crazy!

23
00:02:58,136 --> 00:03:00,680
Sorry. I really want
to practice, too,

24
00:03:00,722 --> 00:03:03,183
but I got put on the morning
shift at my class' booth

25
00:03:03,224 --> 00:03:04,684
and I have to stay.

26
00:03:04,726 --> 00:03:05,477
Uhh...

27
00:03:05,518 --> 00:03:07,687
Thank you very much!

28
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:11,858
Looks like we
tripped the breaker!

29
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,151
Aw, again?

30
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:14,652
Hey, it'll be undercooked!

31
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:16,738
How many times has this
happened today already?

32
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:18,531
Hey, come on,
your not suppose to have

33
00:03:18,573 --> 00:03:20,283
more than three
hot plates at a time!

34
00:03:20,325 --> 00:03:21,326
You know the rules!

35
00:03:21,368 --> 00:03:22,410
It's not us!

36
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:24,913
I bet you anything
it's Class 5!

37
00:03:24,954 --> 00:03:26,956
Seems like a rough gig here...

38
00:03:26,998 --> 00:03:29,376
Thank you, come again!

39
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:35,006
Hey, Mio!

40
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:37,175
Ritsu, do you want to try
and get in some practice

41
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:38,343
before our show today?

42
00:03:38,385 --> 00:03:40,220
Oh, now's no good for me!

43
00:03:40,261 --> 00:03:42,722
Just take a look at
the line I've still got
waiting back there.

44
00:03:42,764 --> 00:03:45,767
Well, isn't there anyone here
who can take over for you?

45
00:03:45,809 --> 00:03:47,727
Not really. You see,
I was the one who

46
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:49,688
suggested doing this
haunted house,

47
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:52,982
so I have to oversee at least
the first few hours here.

48
00:03:53,024 --> 00:03:55,235
Ah. Well, where's Mugi then?

49
00:03:55,276 --> 00:03:56,736
Hm.

50
00:03:58,697 --> 00:03:59,864
(scream)

51
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:02,117
(panicked)

52
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:04,494
Thank you so much!
Hope you enjoyed it!

53
00:04:04,536 --> 00:04:06,371
Right, next
in line, please!

54
00:04:06,413 --> 00:04:07,580
[girl]
It looks scary...

55
00:04:07,622 --> 00:04:09,874
[boy]
It'll be fun! Don't worry!

56
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:10,709
In here?

57
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:11,793
Yep.

58
00:04:11,835 --> 00:04:14,129
It's okay for
class members to go in.

59
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:16,589
It's dark,
so watch your step.

60
00:04:17,173 --> 00:04:18,591
Heh, heh, heh!

61
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:27,392
(nervous breathing)

62
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:34,441
M-Mugi, you in here?

63
00:04:34,482 --> 00:04:38,153
(screaming)

64
00:04:38,194 --> 00:04:41,990
M-Mugi! Where are you?

65
00:04:42,032 --> 00:04:43,992
[Mugi]
Mio, it's me.

66
00:04:44,034 --> 00:04:45,577
Mugi!

67
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:49,372
Ahh!

68
00:04:49,414 --> 00:04:51,916
(Mio screams)

69
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:53,126
Huh?

70
00:04:53,168 --> 00:04:55,587
Thanks, hope you enjoy it!

71
00:04:57,172 --> 00:04:58,882
Nodoka-chan!

72
00:04:58,923 --> 00:05:01,468
Your voice is still scratchy.
Are you gonna be all right?

73
00:05:01,509 --> 00:05:04,095
It's still a little bit sore
from club practice, that's all.

74
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:05,430
I'm gonna be just fine.

75
00:05:05,472 --> 00:05:07,182
Isn't today's your
first performance?

76
00:05:07,223 --> 00:05:09,726
-You go on at three, right?
-Yeah.

77
00:05:09,768 --> 00:05:12,062
Well, you still have a fair
amount of time until then.

78
00:05:12,103 --> 00:05:14,272
Don't you want go and
get in some practice?

79
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:15,648
Yeah. I'm planning to do that

80
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:17,609
as soon as I get
finished with my shift.

81
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:19,778
In that case,
go ahead and take off.

82
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:21,613
I'll ask around and
see if there's someone

83
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:24,074
who can take over the rest
of your shift for you.

84
00:05:24,115 --> 00:05:25,158
Okay, but...

85
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,493
You just go on ahead.

86
00:05:26,534 --> 00:05:28,495
I'll take care of it.

87
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:30,455
Yui!

88
00:05:30,497 --> 00:05:32,040
What are you waiting for?

89
00:05:32,082 --> 00:05:33,249
Go practice.

90
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:35,085
Ah!

91
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,712
Thanks! I'll be back!

92
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:40,423
Oops! Sorry about that, sonny!

93
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:43,802
Hm!

94
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:46,513
Go on in!
Enjoy yourselves!

95
00:05:46,554 --> 00:05:47,681
[Panting]
Ritchan!

96
00:05:47,722 --> 00:05:48,473
Hey!

97
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:49,766
Where are Mio and Mugi?

98
00:05:49,808 --> 00:05:51,685
Your voice hasn't
back yet, huh?

99
00:05:51,726 --> 00:05:53,770
No, I'm afraid it still
sounds a little raspy.

100
00:05:53,812 --> 00:05:56,481
Try saying something like,
"Thank you for the grub"!

101
00:05:56,523 --> 00:05:57,816
Thank you for the grub!

102
00:05:57,857 --> 00:06:00,402
Ha! You sound like
a sumo wrestler!

103
00:06:00,443 --> 00:06:02,529
Treat a training match
as a tournament,

104
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:04,781
and a tournament as if
it were a training match!

105
00:06:04,823 --> 00:06:08,451
Sumo is not a national sport,
it is a martial art!

106
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:11,329
Is this what it means to be
defeated in the ring,

107
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:13,373
but victorious in technique?

108
00:06:13,415 --> 00:06:15,291
Dosukoi, dosukoi, dosukoi!

109
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:18,503
Dosukoi, dosukoi!

110
00:06:20,588 --> 00:06:22,507
So where's Mio-chan
and Mugi-chan?

111
00:06:22,549 --> 00:06:24,134
Sorry, I couldn't resist!

112
00:06:24,175 --> 00:06:25,760
Mugi is working inside here,

113
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:28,179
but Mio might have gone on
up to the club room.

114
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:30,557
C'mon, we gotta get in
some practice!

115
00:06:30,598 --> 00:06:31,975
You're right, we should.

116
00:06:32,017 --> 00:06:33,810
Mugi and I are
gonna be relieved soon,

117
00:06:33,852 --> 00:06:36,354
so we'll meet you upstairs
just as soon as we can.

118
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:38,064
Got it.

119
00:06:39,524 --> 00:06:42,110
We're gonna practice, huh?

120
00:06:42,152 --> 00:06:43,695
Hm...

121
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:49,534
Next in line, step right up!

122
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:02,297
What're you doing, Yui?

123
00:07:02,339 --> 00:07:04,090
Shhh!

124
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:06,426
Huh?

125
00:07:06,468 --> 00:07:09,179
(giggles)

126
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:12,891
[Ritsu]
Wow! I bet she's been
practicing up here all morning.

127
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:14,559
[Mugi]
Yes.

128
00:07:16,895 --> 00:07:18,772
Sorry to keep you waiting, Mio!

129
00:07:18,813 --> 00:07:21,483
We're sorry we
left you by yourself.

130
00:07:21,524 --> 00:07:23,526
Yeah, we all want to
practice, too!

131
00:07:23,568 --> 00:07:25,653
You guys...

132
00:07:27,655 --> 00:07:29,407
What kept you?!

133
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:32,786
(Playing "Fuwa Fuwa Time")

134
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:39,209
Yeah! All right! That didn't
sound too bad at all.

135
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:41,419
Oh yes, that was perfect!

136
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:43,797
Do you think you can
do this, Mio-chan?

137
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:44,923
Uh...

138
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:46,925
Mm... Mm-hmm...

139
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:49,969
[Mugi]
We'll play it just like that.

140
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:53,932
I knew I'd find you here!

141
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:55,892
Is there a problem,
Ms. Yamanaka?

142
00:07:55,934 --> 00:07:58,395
Hehe... Although it
wasn't voluntary,

143
00:07:58,436 --> 00:08:00,021
I am your club's advisor.

144
00:08:00,063 --> 00:08:03,733
So I thought I ought to do
something to help out.

145
00:08:03,775 --> 00:08:06,194
I made costumes
for each of you!

146
00:08:06,236 --> 00:08:07,612
You're way too into this!

147
00:08:07,654 --> 00:08:11,366
Ms. Yamanaka, we appreciate
the sentiment and all...

148
00:08:11,408 --> 00:08:13,868
Huh?

149
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:16,246
You expect me to
put that on and sing?

150
00:08:16,287 --> 00:08:17,580
In front of the whole school...

151
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:19,457
[Ritsu]
But not the best timing.

152
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:20,834
I don't understand?

153
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:23,336
Are you telling me
that you don't care for them?

154
00:08:23,378 --> 00:08:25,088
(Mio panics)

155
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:28,258
If you want, you can always
wear my old costume!

156
00:08:28,299 --> 00:08:31,553
Ah! I suddenly feel like that
last outfit wasn't so bad!

157
00:08:31,594 --> 00:08:33,304
Stop it, Ms. Yamanaka!

158
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:36,975
Mio isn't the only one who'd be
embarrassed to wear this stuff.

159
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:38,143
That's right!

160
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:39,644
Gosh, you really mean that?

161
00:08:39,686 --> 00:08:42,022
But I worked so hard
on making them...

162
00:08:42,063 --> 00:08:43,481
And besides...

163
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:46,151
Yui-chan and Mugi-chan are only
too happy to wear theirs.

164
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:47,527
Ugh!

165
00:08:47,569 --> 00:08:49,487
Would you two cut it out!

166
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:51,656
Why is all of this happening?

167
00:08:51,698 --> 00:08:54,492
You're not still
nervous, are you?

168
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:56,036
How about I give you
a makeup job

169
00:08:56,077 --> 00:08:58,580
so insane that no one
will know it's you?!

170
00:08:58,621 --> 00:09:00,081
N-no, thank you!

171
00:09:00,123 --> 00:09:03,710
Right! You go and break a leg
out there, girls!

172
00:09:07,047 --> 00:09:09,758
Ah! Oh no! All this craziness
has made me forget

173
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:11,134
everything I'm suppose to do!

174
00:09:11,176 --> 00:09:13,928
Let's practice then!
It's the only cure!

175
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:16,097
She's right, let's practice!

176
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:19,225
Pretend that didn't happen...
That didn't happen.

177
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:23,605
(nervous laugh)

178
00:09:27,442 --> 00:09:29,652
*

179
00:09:29,694 --> 00:09:31,738
[Yui]
K-ON!

180
00:09:35,116 --> 00:09:38,161
Okay, go ahead and carry this
down to the auditorium.

181
00:09:38,203 --> 00:09:40,413
Okay... Whoa!

182
00:09:40,455 --> 00:09:41,915
It's pretty heavy,
so be careful.

183
00:09:41,956 --> 00:09:44,834
Hey, by the way,
how's Mio-chan doing?

184
00:09:44,876 --> 00:09:47,504
Well, I'm having Mio
focus on something else.

185
00:09:47,545 --> 00:09:50,048
<i>I'm on vocals...</i>

186
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:53,218
<i>In front of</i>
<i>the whole school...</i>

187
00:09:54,052 --> 00:09:55,720
That's obviously
what will happen.

188
00:09:55,762 --> 00:09:58,431
It's too risky to have her
move any equipment around.

189
00:09:58,473 --> 00:10:00,809
Oh yeah, I see...

190
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:06,106
(struggling)

191
00:10:10,527 --> 00:10:13,655
(Mugi humming)

192
00:10:14,406 --> 00:10:17,200
(Yui groans)

193
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:21,538
(Mugi humming)

194
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:23,832
<i>There's not a</i>
<i>bead of sweat on her!</i>

195
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:27,168
La de da de da...

196
00:10:34,259 --> 00:10:35,844
Nodoka-chan...

197
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:38,263
Ah, Yui. The play is just
getting starting now,

198
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:40,974
so leave that in
the corner, okay?

199
00:10:41,016 --> 00:10:42,767
Gotcha...

200
00:10:44,394 --> 00:10:45,645
Whew...

201
00:10:45,687 --> 00:10:47,355
All right, the
Choir Club is up next,

202
00:10:47,397 --> 00:10:50,066
then the Light Music Club
is up after that.

203
00:10:50,108 --> 00:10:52,986
All of their
equipment is here.

204
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:55,989
<i>It's almost time!</i>

205
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:09,794
Ah... We're finally done
moving it all!

206
00:11:09,836 --> 00:11:11,629
Yeah, good work.

207
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:13,798
Tea's ready!
Come on and get it you two!

208
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:16,509
Yay! That's our Mugi-chan!

209
00:11:16,551 --> 00:11:21,348
Ritchan, you and Mio are
childhood friends, aren't you?

210
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:22,557
Yeah, that's right.

211
00:11:22,599 --> 00:11:24,059
For how long would you say?

212
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:26,978
We've been joined at the hip
since kindergarten!

213
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:28,146
Huh?

214
00:11:28,188 --> 00:11:30,774
No, wait. Maybe it was
since grade school?

215
00:11:30,815 --> 00:11:33,151
Then you're not really
childhood friends.

216
00:11:33,193 --> 00:11:35,779
Now, has Mio-chan
always been the shy type

217
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,697
ever since she was
just a little girl?

218
00:11:37,739 --> 00:11:39,324
You better believe it.

219
00:11:39,366 --> 00:11:40,742
<i>There was one time...</i>

220
00:11:40,784 --> 00:11:43,411
Oh, my! You've got
really pretty hair!

221
00:11:43,453 --> 00:11:44,537
Ah!

222
00:11:44,579 --> 00:11:46,122
<i>When I said to her...</i>

223
00:11:46,164 --> 00:11:50,168
Oh, wow! You're left-handed!
That's really cool!

224
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:51,544
Hahaha!

225
00:11:51,586 --> 00:11:54,422
Everybody,
Mio-chan's so awesome!

226
00:11:54,464 --> 00:11:56,633
<i>When I said stuff like that,</i>

227
00:11:56,675 --> 00:12:00,178
she go totally beet-red and get
all flustered and embarrassed!

228
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:02,972
Well then, it's your fault
the way she is, Ritchan!

229
00:12:03,014 --> 00:12:05,558
Has all the equipment
been carried over?

230
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,268
Mio-chan!

231
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:11,439
You... got your nerves
under control?

232
00:12:11,481 --> 00:12:12,524
Hm?

233
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:14,109
Here you are.

234
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:16,736
Surprising, considering you
were against doing the vocals.

235
00:12:16,778 --> 00:12:19,864
Get real.
I'm not a baby, you know.

236
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:25,787
I can't let myself freak out
over every little thing forever.

237
00:12:28,123 --> 00:12:31,042
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>
<i>She's totally freaking out!</i>

238
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,257
We're about to go on
in a few minutes!

239
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:40,218
How are you gonna perform
in your condition?

240
00:12:44,222 --> 00:12:45,640
I can't do it.

241
00:12:45,682 --> 00:12:48,685
Oh, Ritsu, please do
the vocals for me!

242
00:12:48,727 --> 00:12:50,895
If I did that, who would
play the drums then?

243
00:12:50,937 --> 00:12:52,564
I'll play them, please!

244
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:54,691
Then who's suppose to
play the bass?!

245
00:12:54,733 --> 00:12:56,651
I'll play the bass,
too, please!

246
00:12:56,693 --> 00:12:58,028
Have it your way!

247
00:12:58,069 --> 00:12:59,863
I'd love to see how
you're gonna pull that off!

248
00:12:59,904 --> 00:13:02,574
Ritsu! Ritsu!

249
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:04,409
Would you please
get off me, Mio!

250
00:13:04,451 --> 00:13:06,411
Ritsu! Ritsu! Ritsu!

251
00:13:06,453 --> 00:13:09,164
[Yui]
This is all my fault.
I'm sorry, Mio-chan.

252
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:12,459
If I hadn't overdone it
and did this to my voice,

253
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:16,296
you wouldn't have to go
up on stage and sing today.

254
00:13:16,338 --> 00:13:17,756
Yui...

255
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:19,299
Hm...

256
00:13:19,341 --> 00:13:21,634
Don't worry, I'll handle
the vocals, okay!

257
00:13:21,676 --> 00:13:23,053
No, no, no, no...

258
00:13:23,094 --> 00:13:25,221
Yui, I'm sorry,
that's not what I wanted!

259
00:13:25,263 --> 00:13:26,973
You know that!

260
00:13:27,599 --> 00:13:32,312
(nervous fidgeting)

261
00:13:34,064 --> 00:13:36,566
Hm... Oh, that's right!

262
00:13:36,608 --> 00:13:38,735
We need to come up
with a spiel!

263
00:13:38,777 --> 00:13:40,612
What is a spiel?

264
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:42,238
Hm? Intros and stuff!

265
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:44,908
You know, like when the band
banters with the crowd

266
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:46,743
between songs at a concert.

267
00:13:46,785 --> 00:13:49,120
Oh, right, right!

268
00:13:57,796 --> 00:14:00,423
Hey, everybody!
How are you doing?!

269
00:14:00,465 --> 00:14:02,926
(crowd applauding)

270
00:14:04,594 --> 00:14:06,596
The Light Music Club would
like to welcome each

271
00:14:06,638 --> 00:14:09,516
and every one of you to our
very first show ever today!

272
00:14:09,557 --> 00:14:10,725
(crowd applauding)

273
00:14:10,767 --> 00:14:12,310
Haha! Woo! Woo!

274
00:14:12,352 --> 00:14:13,436
Hehe...

275
00:14:13,478 --> 00:14:15,522
[Ritsu]
Now, let's introduce
our members!

276
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:19,025
Guitar! You can always find her
slacking off on her days off,

277
00:14:19,067 --> 00:14:20,944
"If it's sweet, leave it to me!"
she always says,

278
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:24,989
It's the devil-may-care
fairy, Yui!

279
00:14:25,031 --> 00:14:28,368
(making guitar sounds)

280
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:29,828
(crowd applauding)

281
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:31,413
And on keyboards!

282
00:14:31,454 --> 00:14:33,456
She's your girl when it comes
to fine snack goods!

283
00:14:33,498 --> 00:14:36,418
She has the graceful, lively,
natural airhead of a rich girl,

284
00:14:36,459 --> 00:14:39,337
give a big hand to, Mugi!

285
00:14:40,714 --> 00:14:42,757
(making keyboard sounds)

286
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:44,634
(crowd applauding)

287
00:14:44,676 --> 00:14:47,053
And on bass and vocals!

288
00:14:47,095 --> 00:14:50,724
Scary and gory stories are
most definitely not her thing!

289
00:14:50,765 --> 00:14:52,475
She's the Don of
the Light Music Club,

290
00:14:52,517 --> 00:14:55,061
the dangerous queen, it's Mio!

291
00:14:55,103 --> 00:14:56,354
(thump)
Ow!

292
00:14:56,396 --> 00:14:58,481
Who are you calling
dangerous, huh?!

293
00:14:58,523 --> 00:15:00,358
You proved my point...

294
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,568
(giggles)

295
00:15:01,609 --> 00:15:04,195
And last but not least, me!

296
00:15:04,237 --> 00:15:06,990
Fair of face and figure,
and mind!

297
00:15:07,032 --> 00:15:09,909
She's everybody's idol
with her sunny smile.

298
00:15:09,951 --> 00:15:11,911
Give a big hand to...
me, Ritsu!

299
00:15:11,953 --> 00:15:13,121
(thump)
Ow!

300
00:15:13,163 --> 00:15:15,832
Quit tooting your own horn!

301
00:15:15,874 --> 00:15:18,293
(laughing)

302
00:15:18,877 --> 00:15:20,337
Uh...

303
00:15:20,837 --> 00:15:24,257
(laughing)

304
00:15:30,638 --> 00:15:33,058
(laughing)

305
00:15:35,226 --> 00:15:39,189
(crowd applauding)

306
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:42,192
[announcer]
Let's hear it for
the Choir Club!

307
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:57,540
Ah! Look at all those
people out there!

308
00:15:57,582 --> 00:16:00,335
Goodness, you're right.

309
00:16:00,377 --> 00:16:02,045
(deep breath)

310
00:16:03,713 --> 00:16:06,299
<i>Our very first number...</i>

311
00:16:06,758 --> 00:16:08,385
Come on!

312
00:16:08,426 --> 00:16:11,262
Time to get out there and
show them what we practiced!

313
00:16:11,304 --> 00:16:12,806
Yes!

314
00:16:12,847 --> 00:16:14,933
[Mio]
Um, Ritsu...

315
00:16:16,476 --> 00:16:20,271
Do I really have to go out
on stage looking like this?

316
00:16:21,189 --> 00:16:23,274
I think it suits you
really well, Mio.

317
00:16:23,316 --> 00:16:25,527
She's right!
It looks so cute on you!

318
00:16:25,568 --> 00:16:27,237
Oh man!

319
00:16:27,278 --> 00:16:30,031
[announcer]
Next up is a performance by
the Light Music Club!

320
00:16:30,073 --> 00:16:32,575
So get ready for
some great music!

321
00:16:39,791 --> 00:16:42,669
All right now, let's do it!

322
00:16:42,711 --> 00:16:44,629
Yeah!

323
00:16:45,672 --> 00:16:46,715
Whoa!

324

They're so cute!

Huh?

We all know that you
practiced and practiced

00:17:43,688 --> 00:17:47,108
and practiced your heart out
for this, Mio-chan.

That was some great work
yesterday, everyone!

Yeah, really good work!

365
00:21:50,602 --> 00:21:52,687
For your first time
in front of a crowd,

366
00:21:52,729 --> 00:21:55,523
I think you did
pretty good, Yui!

Aw!

368

As for Mio...

369
00:21:59,402 --> 00:22:02,989
She's apparently got
her own fan club now!

370

Oh, amazing!

371
00:22:04,532 --> 00:22:05,784
But I'm afraid she's

372
00:22:05,825 --> 00:22:07,744
kind of out of commission
at the moment...

373

our Christmas party!

Ah!

379

I wanted this instead, so
asked them to exchange it.

00:23:57,479 --> 00:24:00,023
Now then, what should I make?

All done!

Gee, I wonder if Santa's
gonna come this year?

383

I haven't been very good,

384
00:24:14,162 --> 00:24:17,123
so I'm afraid
maybe he won't come.

May I get presents!
