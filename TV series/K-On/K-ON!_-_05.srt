00:00:02,168 --> 00:00:05,088
(Cicada's cry)

2
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:07,048
(Door opens)

3
00:00:08,633 --> 00:00:10,093
Hey, Ritchan.

4
00:00:10,135 --> 00:00:11,803
Hey there, Yui.

5
00:00:12,554 --> 00:00:14,347
Ugh, so hot.

6
00:00:14,389 --> 00:00:16,516
Huh? What's that
you looking at?

7
00:00:16,558 --> 00:00:19,561
I found something interesting.
Here, check it out.

8
00:00:19,602 --> 00:00:21,730
Wow, what's with
these pictures?

9
00:00:21,771 --> 00:00:25,400
They were in a cardboard box
that Mio found earlier.

10
00:00:25,442 --> 00:00:27,986
They're pictures of
a past Light Music Club.

11
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:30,280
Whoa, these are amazing!

12
00:00:30,321 --> 00:00:32,032
They got that look
every band has,

13
00:00:32,073 --> 00:00:33,825
no matter when in
history they played.

14
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:35,618
Yeah, I guess you're right.

15
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:37,620
<i>Say the word "band,"</i>
<i>and this used to be</i>

16
00:00:37,662 --> 00:00:40,582
<i>the only image that</i>
<i>popped into my head.</i>

17
00:00:43,752 --> 00:00:46,129
<i>("Cagayake! Girls" plays)</i>

18
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:21,808
Maybe we can just try
changing this a little bit.

19
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:22,767
Hmm...

20
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:23,601
Ow!

21
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:24,728
What happened?

22
00:02:24,769 --> 00:02:27,564
I scraped the skin
off my finger.

23
00:02:27,605 --> 00:02:29,524
Whoa, that looks painful.

24
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:32,652
You, too, Mio!
Look at my finger!

25
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:34,446
Hm?

26
00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:37,866
(Repeating)
I'm not looking,
I'm not listening...

27
00:02:37,907 --> 00:02:39,075
Hehehe...

28
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:40,243
Ah, my hands!

29
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:42,078
I've been practicing
drums too much.

30
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,122
The blisters on
my hand broke open!

31
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:45,248
(Screams)

32
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:47,125
Hahaha...

33
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:49,586
Take a look!
It's gross!

34
00:02:49,627 --> 00:02:51,796
(Mio crying)
Disgusting! Boo!

35
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:53,214
Check it out!

36
00:02:53,256 --> 00:02:56,968
Ritchan, do we have any
adhesive bandages here?

37
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:59,637
In your face!
It's near you!

38
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:00,638
(Door opens)

39
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,390
[Ms. Yamanaka]
Don't mind me.

40
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:05,310
I need to borrow these music
stands for a while. Oh?

41
00:03:05,352 --> 00:03:07,979
(Ritsu scaring Mio)
(Mio crying)

42
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:09,522
Hehe...

43
00:03:09,564 --> 00:03:11,358
{\an8}*

44
00:03:14,152 --> 00:03:16,863
[Teacher]
Would the two of you mind
carrying these notebooks for me?

45
00:03:16,905 --> 00:03:20,200
Thank you very much
for all your help.

46
00:03:22,994 --> 00:03:23,828
[Yui]
Ow!

47
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:24,579
Huh?

48
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:25,497
Ow...

49
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:27,374
The antiseptic's
really stinging!

50
00:03:27,415 --> 00:03:32,837
I know. All right, hold your
finger still just like that.

51
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,006
<i>What a tidy desk...</i>

52
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:37,300
Done. There, that should do it.

53
00:03:37,342 --> 00:03:39,427
Thanks for your help,
Ms. Yamanaka.

54
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:41,513
Let's see the others.

55
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:43,056
Um...

56
00:03:43,098 --> 00:03:45,183
Well, you have a ways to go.

57
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:48,645
The way your skin is right now,
it's going to peel off soon.

58
00:03:48,687 --> 00:03:49,979
Huh?!

59
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:52,023
Your skin will get tougher
each time this happens,

60
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:54,442
and you'll become a better
player in the process.

61
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:56,945
It's a guitarist's
rite of passage.

62
00:03:56,986 --> 00:03:58,738
Oh, it is?

63
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,115
Hey, wait a second!

64
00:04:00,156 --> 00:04:02,450
Did you used to play guitar,
Ms. Yamanaka?

65
00:04:02,492 --> 00:04:06,037
Not me, but I have
some friends who did.

66
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:08,665
Hmm...

67
00:04:08,707 --> 00:04:11,042
Oh, very good work today.

68
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:12,711
You, too.

69
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:13,920
See you later.

70
00:04:13,962 --> 00:04:15,046
U-uh, yes.

71
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:17,257
Hey, would you like some tea?

72
00:04:17,298 --> 00:04:18,883
[Teacher]
Yeah, thanks.

73
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:20,844
<i>What a nice teacher...</i>

74
00:04:20,885 --> 00:04:21,886
<i>Hm?</i>

75
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:24,514
Mugi-chan!

76
00:04:24,556 --> 00:04:26,433
Ah!

77
00:04:26,474 --> 00:04:27,892
Mugi-chan, is
something the matter?

78
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:31,271
No, I was just thinking
how pretty she was.

79
00:04:31,312 --> 00:04:33,690
Oh, you mean
Ms. Yamanaka?

80
00:04:33,732 --> 00:04:35,567
By the way,
where have you been?

81
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:38,028
Ah, well you see, I was
asked by Mio to go find out

82
00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:40,321
if the Light Music Club
could use the stage

83
00:04:40,363 --> 00:04:42,282
when we play at
the school festival.

84
00:04:42,323 --> 00:04:44,284
But, I'm afraid they
turned our request down

85
00:04:44,325 --> 00:04:46,077
because they said
we aren't recognized

86
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:47,996
as a legitimate club yet.

87
00:04:48,038 --> 00:04:50,749
Oh, that's nice...

88
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:55,003
Hm?

89
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:57,172
Huh?

90
00:04:57,213 --> 00:04:59,049
We're not recognized
as a legitimate club?!

91
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:01,259
No, apparently we are not.

92
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:02,844
I thought in order
to be official,

93
00:05:02,886 --> 00:05:05,263
we just needed to have
four members.

94
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:07,932
Yeah, Yui.
That's what I thought, too.

95
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:09,476
(Sighs)

96
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:12,604
You know, I was thinking,

97
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:14,856
if we're not recognized
as an official club,

98
00:05:14,898 --> 00:05:18,360
is it okay that we've been
hogging the Music Room

99
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:19,861
to ourselves?

100
00:05:19,903 --> 00:05:22,405
Look, nobody's said anything
about it to us so far,

101
00:05:22,447 --> 00:05:24,407
so I'm sure it's okay.
I think.

102
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:26,993
More importantly,
I'd better go and ask them

103
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:28,787
why we're not recognized.

104
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:29,788
Yes, you should.

105
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:32,415
Oh? Hey, what
happened to Mio?

106
00:05:32,457 --> 00:05:33,875
Oh, if you're looking for Mio,

107
00:05:33,917 --> 00:05:36,086
she's still huddled
in terror over there.

108
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:38,338
Would you come back here?!

109
00:05:39,089 --> 00:05:40,006
Greetings, all!

110
00:05:40,048 --> 00:05:40,924
I'm club president!

111
00:05:40,965 --> 00:05:42,759
[Nodoka]
Oh, Yui?

112
00:05:42,801 --> 00:05:44,094
Nodoka-chan?

113
00:05:44,135 --> 00:05:47,305
Wow, Nodoka-chan,
what are you doing here?

114
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:48,598
What do you mean?

115
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,974
I'm here because
I'm on the student council.

116
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:53,144
Oh! That's amazing!
That's my Nodoka-chan!

117
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:56,356
So you two are really
childhood friends?

118
00:05:57,107 --> 00:05:58,358
Well, sorry,

119
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,443
but you don't seem
to be on the list...

120
00:06:00,485 --> 00:06:02,487
Oh, no! You're kidding!

121
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:04,406
No, don't tell me...

122
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:06,825
Ritchan! Does this
raise any theories?

123
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:09,411
Yes, what this
appears to be...

124
00:06:09,452 --> 00:06:11,788
is a sinister plot
by the student council

125
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:14,833
to drive weak clubs
into being disbanded!

126
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:16,668
(Gasps)

127
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:18,003
I know you're really

128
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:19,504
a pure-hearted person,
Nodoka-chan!

129
00:06:19,546 --> 00:06:20,505
Please, snap out of it!

130
00:06:20,547 --> 00:06:21,673
What are you
talking about?

131
00:06:21,715 --> 00:06:22,841
Maybe you just
didn't submit

132
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:25,260
a club activities
application form?

133
00:06:25,301 --> 00:06:27,220
Club activities application?

134
00:06:27,262 --> 00:06:29,014
It's the first I've
heard of this form!

135
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:31,141
No, it's not!

136
00:06:32,142 --> 00:06:33,226
Yes.

137
00:06:33,268 --> 00:06:35,645
That was... back in spring.

138

I knew it, this is
all your fault!

148
00:06:59,753 --> 00:07:01,379
You and your
putting things off.

149
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:05,008
[Mugi]
Oh, dear. Mio, it's not like
she did it deliberately.

150

You're too soft
on her, Mugi!

151

Now, now, now ...

152
00:07:08,595 --> 00:07:10,430
[Nodoka]
How to put this...

153
00:07:10,472 --> 00:07:13,183
I think you're a perfect fit
for the Light Music Club, Yui.

[Ritsu]
Sawako Yamanaka.

165
00:07:40,335 --> 00:07:42,587
Our fair school's music teacher.

166
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:45,840
As a result of her beautiful
features and gentle demeanour,

167
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:48,677
she is popular with not only
the student body,

168
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:50,303
but also the school staff.

169
00:07:50,345 --> 00:07:52,263
Plus, her skill
with instruments

170
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:54,808
and her singing voice
are remarkable.

171
00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:56,017
What?

172
00:07:57,394 --> 00:08:00,647
She is popular enough
to have her own fan club.

173
00:08:00,689 --> 00:08:03,149
What have you
going on about?

174
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:06,111
Uh, hello, girls...

175
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:07,779
Teacher!
What is it?

176
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:11,366
Please agree to be the
Light Music Club's advisor!

177
00:08:11,408 --> 00:08:14,035
Oh, I see. You don't
have an advisor yet...

178
00:08:14,077 --> 00:08:17,330
Ms. Yamanaka, you're the only
teacher that we can turn to.

179
00:08:17,372 --> 00:08:19,165
Oh, please, do it.

180
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:22,627
I'm so sorry.

181
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:24,796
I wish that I could be
your advisor, I really do,

182
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:26,965
but I'm already the
school band's advisor,

183
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:29,467
so there's no way
I could handle another.

184
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:30,677
You're kidding...

185
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:33,179
I'm really am
sorry about this.

186
00:08:35,265 --> 00:08:36,766
She's so desirable,

187
00:08:36,808 --> 00:08:38,601
that she has been
courted by countless men.

188
00:08:38,643 --> 00:08:40,812
Uh, look, flattery isn't
going to change anything!

189
00:08:40,854 --> 00:08:42,731
We won't take up
any of your time!

190
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:44,983
That's right! Because we always
practice all on our own!

191
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:47,610
Just write your name here and
give it your official stamp!

192
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:49,070
Simple, huh?

193
00:08:49,112 --> 00:08:51,156

195
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:56,327
Ms. Yamanaka, you graduated
from here, didn't you?

196
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:57,704
Well, yes...

197
00:08:57,746 --> 00:08:59,706
We were looking through

199

Eh?!

00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:04,544
Huh? Hm...

201
00:09:04,586 --> 00:09:06,338
Is something the
matter with you?

202
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:08,715
Um, so, where is
that album right now?

203
00:09:08,757 --> 00:09:11,968
Uh, well, it's in
our club room.

It's true, I was once a

I have some concerns,
such as the intro and outro,

and the way your rhythm section
is all over the place,

any cohesive hook.

Wah!

327
00:14:43,717 --> 00:14:45,301
Yes, I would!

328
00:14:45,343 --> 00:14:46,970
<i>She would?!</i>

329
00:14:52,684 --> 00:14:54,561
Let's see...

330
00:14:56,438 --> 00:14:58,732
We should have started
with the lyrics first.

331
00:14:58,773 --> 00:15:01,317
(Phone buzzes)

332
00:15:02,777 --> 00:15:04,320
Mugi?

333
00:15:04,362 --> 00:15:06,489
[Mugi]
<i>Now that Ms. Yamanaka</i>
<i>has become our advisor,</i>

334
00:15:06,531 --> 00:15:09,075
<i>my heart is pounding</i>
<i>for some reason.</i>

335
00:15:09,117 --> 00:15:11,745
<i>Good luck with the lyrics.</i>

336
00:15:11,786 --> 00:15:13,913
"My heart is pounding"?

337
00:15:16,791 --> 00:15:18,918
Nah, no way...

338
00:15:22,047 --> 00:15:23,006
They're done?!

339
00:15:23,048 --> 00:15:24,507
Yeah... All done.

340
00:15:24,549 --> 00:15:25,633
Show us, show us!

341
00:15:25,675 --> 00:15:27,302
Already?!

342
00:15:27,344 --> 00:15:28,845
Yes, already!

343
00:15:28,887 --> 00:15:30,513
I would love to see them, too.

344
00:15:30,555 --> 00:15:33,350
B-but I'm embarrassed
to show them to you...

345
00:15:33,391 --> 00:15:36,603
Oh, Mio-chan,
no one is gonna laugh.

346
00:15:36,644 --> 00:15:38,021
[Ritsu]
Yeah, yeah!

347
00:15:38,063 --> 00:15:39,356
[Mio]
But I... Wait a minute!

348
00:15:39,397 --> 00:15:41,274
[Ritsu]
We can't wait!
If you brought them,

349
00:15:41,316 --> 00:15:43,735
that means you're ready
to show them to us, right?!

350
00:15:43,777 --> 00:15:45,362
[Mugi]
Mio, come on, please!

351
00:15:45,403 --> 00:15:48,323
You can give me a little peek!
Just one little peek!

352
00:15:48,365 --> 00:15:50,158
[Ritsu]
No fair! If anybody's
going to see them,

353
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,368
I'm gonna be first!

354
00:15:51,409 --> 00:15:52,535
Why, you?

355
00:15:52,577 --> 00:15:54,829
Why? Because I'm
club president, that's why!

356
00:15:54,871 --> 00:15:56,831
Wha...? Then I'm
Mio-chan's soulmate!

357
00:15:56,873 --> 00:15:58,541
So I get to see them first.
So, there!

358
00:15:58,583 --> 00:16:00,877
[Mugi]
Well then, I'm Mio-chan's
soulmate number two!

359
00:16:00,919 --> 00:16:02,045
And I get to see them next.

360
00:16:02,087 --> 00:16:03,672
[Ritsu]
You got a lot of gall!

361
00:16:03,713 --> 00:16:05,924
I am the place that Mio's
soul calls home, right?!

362
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:07,634
[Mio]
Since when?

363
00:16:07,676 --> 00:16:10,095
[Yui]
Oh, I wonder how my granny
out in the country is doing?

364
00:16:10,136 --> 00:16:11,721
[Ritsu]
That's got nothing
to do with this.

365
00:16:11,763 --> 00:16:14,140
[Mio]
Did I send mine a
New Year's card last year?

366
00:16:14,182 --> 00:16:15,892
[Ritsu]
Don't change the subject!

367
00:16:15,934 --> 00:16:18,186
Let's see the damn thing!

368
00:16:18,728 --> 00:16:19,521
Ah!

369
00:16:19,562 --> 00:16:21,481
Oh, let me see?

370
00:16:28,279 --> 00:16:31,199
I'm all itchy!
I want to tear this up!

371
00:16:31,241 --> 00:16:33,910
[Mio]
I think that, considering
how fast I did it,

372
00:16:33,952 --> 00:16:35,453
it turned out pretty well...

373
00:16:35,495 --> 00:16:37,872
Huh?

374
00:16:37,914 --> 00:16:39,416
Do you really think
that it's no good?

375
00:16:39,457 --> 00:16:41,459
"No good" might be a
little strong...

376
00:16:41,501 --> 00:16:43,920
Yeah, more like it
doesn't quite fit

377
00:16:43,962 --> 00:16:45,964
the image that we're
trying to create.

378
00:16:46,006 --> 00:16:47,924
C'mon, Yui, you haven't
said anything.

379
00:16:47,966 --> 00:16:48,883
What do you think?

380
00:16:48,925 --> 00:16:50,343
It was awesome...

381
00:16:50,385 --> 00:16:52,053
Seriously?!

382
00:16:52,095 --> 00:16:53,430
I love these lyrics.

383
00:16:53,471 --> 00:16:54,931
I think they're
just wonderful!

384
00:16:54,973 --> 00:16:56,516
Y-you mean it?

385
00:16:56,558 --> 00:16:57,726
Uh...

386
00:16:57,767 --> 00:16:59,436
Hey, What do you think
about the lyrics, Mugi?

387
00:16:59,477 --> 00:17:01,438
She's totally
enchanted!

388
00:17:01,479 --> 00:17:04,607
Mugi, you aren't seriously
telling me that you like them?

389
00:17:04,649 --> 00:17:05,775
I do.

390
00:17:05,817 --> 00:17:07,569
Uh, you think
these lyrics work?

391
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:08,486
I do.

392
00:17:08,528 --> 00:17:09,612
Seriously?

393
00:17:09,654 --> 00:17:10,447
Really.

394
00:17:10,488 --> 00:17:11,614
For real?

395
00:17:11,656 --> 00:17:12,782
Yes, bring it on.

396
00:17:12,824 --> 00:17:15,243
Uh... S-Sawako!
"Sawako"?

397
00:17:15,285 --> 00:17:17,287
You think that these lyrics
are unworkable, right?

398
00:17:17,328 --> 00:17:19,456
Why, yes!
I suppose they're not.

399
00:17:19,497 --> 00:17:21,249
See, I'm right?
Come on, you three,

400
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:23,084
let's rethink
our approach, okay?

401
00:17:23,126 --> 00:17:24,002
Let's take a deep breath and...

402
00:17:24,044 --> 00:17:25,503
<i>Wait a minute...</i>

403
00:17:25,545 --> 00:17:27,130
<i>Maybe I can give my</i>
<i>image a boost by saying</i>

404
00:17:27,172 --> 00:17:29,299
<i>I like this</i>
<i>perky, sappy crap.</i>

405
00:17:29,341 --> 00:17:31,259
<i>You're young</i>
<i>at heart, Ms. Yamanaka!</i>

406
00:17:31,301 --> 00:17:32,844
<i>That's our Ms. Yamanaka!</i>

407
00:17:32,886 --> 00:17:34,721
<i>It's Ms. Yamanaka</i>
<i>or no one!</i>

408
00:17:34,763 --> 00:17:42,437
<i>Ya-ma-na-ka! Woo! Ya-ma-na-ka!</i>
<i>Woo! Ya-ma-na-ka! Woo!</i>

409
00:17:42,479 --> 00:17:44,230
You know, now that
I think about it,

410
00:17:44,272 --> 00:17:46,733
I guess I really like
those lyrics, too!

411
00:17:46,775 --> 00:17:49,319
Say what?!

412
00:17:49,361 --> 00:17:51,488
Well, I suppose we're going
with these lyrics, then.

413
00:17:51,529 --> 00:17:53,031
Yay!

414
00:17:53,073 --> 00:17:54,824
Isn't this wonderful, Mio-chan?

415
00:17:54,866 --> 00:17:56,451
Um, yeah...

416
00:17:56,493 --> 00:17:58,703
That means we'll be going
with Mio on vocals.

417
00:17:58,745 --> 00:17:59,704
Huh?

418
00:17:59,746 --> 00:18:01,748
N-no, I couldn't!

419
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:02,957
Why not?

420
00:18:02,999 --> 00:18:05,335
Well, I...
because I...

421
00:18:05,377 --> 00:18:08,630
Because I can't sing such
embarrassing lyrics, that's why!

422
00:18:08,672 --> 00:18:10,340
Hey, you wrote 'em, lady!

423
00:18:10,382 --> 00:18:12,133
This is gonna be a problem...

424
00:18:12,175 --> 00:18:15,261
Well, I guess that
leaves us with...

425
00:18:16,221 --> 00:18:17,681
Mugi, want to try?

426
00:18:17,722 --> 00:18:19,933
I would, but I already
have my hands full

427
00:18:19,974 --> 00:18:21,184
just managing the keyboard.

428
00:18:21,226 --> 00:18:24,229
Ah, okay, then...

429
00:18:27,023 --> 00:18:28,733
I guess not...

430
00:18:28,775 --> 00:18:30,443
(Yui clears throat)

431
00:18:31,027 --> 00:18:32,821
Ha... Ahh...

432
00:18:37,158 --> 00:18:38,952
Yui, you wanna try?

433
00:18:38,993 --> 00:18:40,412
Wha.. You asking me?!

434
00:18:40,453 --> 00:18:42,580
Well, but I'm not really
a good singer, you know,

435
00:18:42,622 --> 00:18:45,041
so I don't know if I'd be
the best choice for us.

436
00:18:45,083 --> 00:18:47,210
I'm not sure if I should
even try to do it...

437
00:18:47,252 --> 00:18:48,086
Never mind, then.

438
00:18:48,128 --> 00:18:49,254
I'm sorry, I lied!

439
00:18:49,295 --> 00:18:50,880
I'll sing! I want to sing!

440
00:18:50,922 --> 00:18:53,258
You gotta let me try it!

441
00:18:53,299 --> 00:18:55,844
Okay then,
sing something.

442
00:18:55,885 --> 00:18:57,303
Roger!

443
00:18:59,055 --> 00:19:00,223
(Singing "Fuwa Fuwa Time")

444
00:19:00,265 --> 00:19:02,017
[Ritsu]
Hold it, hold it!

445
00:19:02,058 --> 00:19:04,477
You'll have to sing while
you're playing guitar!

446
00:19:04,519 --> 00:19:06,938
Oh, yeah, you're right.
I totally forgot.

447
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:08,440
Oh, geez...

448
00:19:08,481 --> 00:19:09,774
Okay...

449
00:19:12,777 --> 00:19:15,739
(Playing "Fuwa Fuwa Time")

450
00:19:25,957 --> 00:19:29,044
This time she's forgetting
to sing while she plays!

451
00:19:29,085 --> 00:19:31,004
(Crying)

452
00:19:31,046 --> 00:19:34,883
I can't sing and play guitar
at the same time! I can't!

453
00:19:34,924 --> 00:19:36,384
I guess I have no choice.

454
00:19:36,426 --> 00:19:39,095
I'll have to give you
special training.

455
00:19:39,137 --> 00:19:41,348
Really!

456
00:19:41,389 --> 00:19:42,891
First thing I'm gonna show you

457
00:19:42,932 --> 00:19:43,975
is how to Hendrix...

458
00:19:44,017 --> 00:19:45,101
Oh, that's all right.

459
00:19:45,143 --> 00:19:45,977
Huh?

460
00:19:46,019 --> 00:19:47,437
(Swooning)

461
00:19:47,479 --> 00:19:50,565
Okay, do your best and
try to keep up with me!

462
00:19:50,607 --> 00:19:52,192
Roger!

463
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:55,070
Ritsu...

464
00:19:55,111 --> 00:19:56,696
What is it?

465
00:19:56,738 --> 00:19:58,073
You don't think that Mugi

466
00:19:58,114 --> 00:20:00,617
has a thing for
Ms. Yamanaka, do you?

467
00:20:00,658 --> 00:20:01,743
Come again?

468
00:20:01,785 --> 00:20:03,161
Want I'm trying to ask is,

469
00:20:03,203 --> 00:20:04,913
think she's got
a crush on her?

470
00:20:04,954 --> 00:20:06,414
What! Seriously?

471
00:20:06,456 --> 00:20:08,958
Mugi! I was wondering,
do you like Ms. Yamanaka?

472
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,210
Hey, Ritsu!

473
00:20:10,251 --> 00:20:12,212
You moron!

474
00:20:12,837 --> 00:20:14,172
Huh?

475
00:20:14,214 --> 00:20:15,548
(Nervous laugh)

476
00:20:17,217 --> 00:20:19,844
Oh, no, I was just...
I was thinking how nice it is

477
00:20:19,886 --> 00:20:21,304
when it's just girls
hanging out.

478
00:20:21,346 --> 00:20:22,764
What? No way...

479
00:20:22,806 --> 00:20:23,973
Oh, well, good for you.

480
00:20:24,015 --> 00:20:25,517
Wait, so you're
okay with it?

481
00:20:25,558 --> 00:20:28,019
If the people involved
are happy,

482
00:20:28,061 --> 00:20:29,813
that's all that
really matters, right?

483
00:20:29,854 --> 00:20:31,606
Well, um...

484
00:20:31,648 --> 00:20:35,151
Uh... What are we
talking about here?

485
00:20:37,654 --> 00:20:40,615
[Nodoka]
All right then, Yui will
be providing the vocals,

486
00:20:40,657 --> 00:20:43,410
and the set list will be
"Fuwa Fuwa Time."

487
00:20:43,451 --> 00:20:45,620
Okay, I'll get in touch
with you again

488
00:20:45,662 --> 00:20:47,622
once your time slot
has been assigned.

489
00:20:47,664 --> 00:20:51,209
Thank goodness and thank you
for coming in person to tell us.

490
00:20:51,251 --> 00:20:53,795
It's all part of a student
council member's duties.

491
00:20:53,837 --> 00:20:56,881
But are you really sure you want
to go with Yui on the vocals?

492
00:20:56,923 --> 00:20:59,926
She's been getting intensive
lessons from Ms. Yamanaka

493
00:20:59,968 --> 00:21:01,594
after school since last week.

494
00:21:01,636 --> 00:21:04,556
We think that she'll have her
whipped into shape in time.

495
00:21:04,597 --> 00:21:05,849
Ah!

496
00:21:07,183 --> 00:21:09,310
[Ms. Yamanaka]
Sorry to keep you waiting.

497
00:21:11,021 --> 00:21:12,522
She's perfect.

498
00:21:12,564 --> 00:21:13,606
(Gasps)

499
00:21:13,648 --> 00:21:17,694
Now, Yui-girl, show 'em
what you've got!

500
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:23,324
Oh!

501
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,076
She's awesome!

502
00:21:25,118 --> 00:21:26,327
She's a lot better!

503
00:21:26,369 --> 00:21:28,580
Her face is
full of confidence!

504
00:21:29,664 --> 00:21:30,832
(Husky singing)

505
00:21:30,874 --> 00:21:32,334
Ah!

506
00:21:32,876 --> 00:21:34,002
Wha...?

507
00:21:34,044 --> 00:21:36,004
I made her practice too much!

508
00:21:36,046 --> 00:21:37,130
I threw my voice out!

509
00:21:37,172 --> 00:21:38,798
Knock off the cutesy act!

510
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:42,010
You're kidding...
Who will do the vocals, then?

511
00:21:42,052 --> 00:21:43,928
All changes must be in
by end of day.

512
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:45,805
What, you're not serious?

513
00:21:45,847 --> 00:21:47,974
Hm... in that case...

514
00:21:52,562 --> 00:21:54,189
Hm?

515
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:55,690
Hm?

516
00:21:55,732 --> 00:21:56,900
Huh?!

517
00:21:56,941 --> 00:21:58,860
You're right, Mio is
the only other person

518
00:21:58,902 --> 00:22:00,403
who knows the lyrics.

519
00:22:00,445 --> 00:22:02,197
Yeah, 'cause she's the one
who came up with them.

520
00:22:02,238 --> 00:22:03,823
[Mugi]
You can do it, Mio!

521
00:22:03,865 --> 00:22:06,743
[Yui]
Do it for Husky-voice Yui!

522
00:22:06,785 --> 00:22:07,994
Ah!

523
00:22:08,828 --> 00:22:10,246
Ugh!

524
00:22:10,288 --> 00:22:11,206
Whoa, Mio!

525
00:22:11,247 --> 00:22:12,290
Mio, what's the matter?

526
00:22:12,332 --> 00:22:13,875
Pull yourself together!

527
00:22:16,336 --> 00:22:19,422
There's only three days
'til we go on!

528
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:22,509
("Don't say 'lazy'" plays)

529
00:23:50,638 --> 00:23:52,766
Ritsu, don't you think we
should get some practice in

530
00:23:52,807 --> 00:23:53,725
before we go on?

531
00:23:53,767 --> 00:23:55,810
Sorry, but I can't
right now!

532
00:23:55,852 --> 00:23:58,480
Well, you still have a fair
amount of time until then.

533
00:23:58,521 --> 00:24:00,523
Don't you want to use
the time to practice?

534
00:24:00,565 --> 00:24:02,400
She's right! Let's practice!

535
00:24:02,442 --> 00:24:05,320
Pretend that didn't happen.
That didn't happen.

536
00:24:05,362 --> 00:24:07,238
Today's the day of
the performance!

537
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:09,491
Let's try and practice
as much as we can!

538
00:24:09,532 --> 00:24:10,658
Let's practice!

539
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:12,660
We're gonna practice, huh?

540
00:24:12,702 --> 00:24:14,871
{\an8}*
