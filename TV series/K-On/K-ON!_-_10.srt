00:00:13,138 --> 00:00:15,682
[Ui]
<i>Hello, Ui Hirasawa here.</i>

2
00:00:15,724 --> 00:00:20,061
<i>I'm hanging out with Azusa-chan</i>
<i>for the first time today.</i>

3
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:22,522
[Azusa]
Hey!

4
00:00:23,148 --> 00:00:24,441
Azusa!

5
00:00:26,484 --> 00:00:27,694
Sorry!

6
00:00:29,738 --> 00:00:31,197
What a cute outfit!

7
00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:32,574
(giggles)

8
00:00:32,615 --> 00:00:34,200
Oh, you're going to that
training camp

9
00:00:34,242 --> 00:00:36,119
with the Light Music
Club, aren't you?

10
00:00:36,161 --> 00:00:38,455
I am. It's three days
and four nights.

11
00:00:38,496 --> 00:00:41,291
My sister said that the one
they all went to last year

12
00:00:41,332 --> 00:00:43,126
turned out to be
a lot of fun.

13
00:00:43,168 --> 00:00:45,337
A lot of fun?

14
00:00:46,713 --> 00:00:47,505
Ah...

15
00:00:47,547 --> 00:00:48,882
I bet she meant they practiced

16
00:00:48,923 --> 00:00:50,050
the whole time, doesn't she?

17
00:00:50,091 --> 00:00:52,469
Hm? Uh... yeah.

18
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:53,970
I think so.

19
00:00:54,012 --> 00:00:57,891
Huh? Ui! Isn't this cute?!

20
00:00:57,932 --> 00:00:58,850
Mmhm.

21
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:00,393
[Azusa]
Oh, I see.

22
00:01:00,435 --> 00:01:03,813
After all, the four of them
play so amazing well together.

23
00:01:03,855 --> 00:01:06,441
They must practice
a lot there...

24
00:01:07,609 --> 00:01:09,861
Right?

25
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:12,238
("Cagayake! Girls" plays)

26
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,253
What's my sister like when
she's at the Light Music Club?

27
00:02:50,295 --> 00:02:53,548
Well, I guess she's kinda...

28
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:54,591
Tell me!

29
00:02:54,632 --> 00:02:57,052
She really doesn't
practice at all,

30
00:02:57,093 --> 00:02:59,220
and she gave me a
pretty weird nickname...

31
00:02:59,262 --> 00:03:00,555
Azu-nyan!

32
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:02,390
and she's all touchy-feely
all the time.

33
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:05,310
Yeah, my sister really is
warm and sweet, isn't she?

34
00:03:05,352 --> 00:03:07,979
Um, that wasn't exactly
what I meant.

35
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:09,147
Huh?

36
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:11,649
So, what is Yui-senpai
doing today?

37
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:12,734
She's at home.

38
00:03:12,776 --> 00:03:15,153
Sis doesn't handle
heat very well.

39
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:16,780
She hates air-conditioning, too.

40
00:03:16,821 --> 00:03:19,449
I can picture her
sprawled out on the floor.

41
00:03:19,491 --> 00:03:22,744
She's been lying around
the house all day lately.

42
00:03:22,786 --> 00:03:24,496
Talk about lazy...

43
00:03:24,537 --> 00:03:27,624
But she's so cute when
she's lying around!

44
00:03:27,665 --> 00:03:28,667
She's adorable!

45
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:30,835
Ui! Ui!

46
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:32,170
Uiuiuiuiui, Ui!

47
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:35,674
Why do Ui and I see
her sister so differently?

48
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:37,842
You know, lately
I've been wishing

49
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:40,387
I had a big sister
who was a lot like Mio.

50
00:03:40,428 --> 00:03:44,766
Yeah, I think she's
really nice, and cool, too.

51
00:03:44,808 --> 00:03:45,809
What about Ritsu?

52
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:47,394
Hmm...

53
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:50,105
Well, she's awfully
irresponsible

54
00:03:50,146 --> 00:03:51,815
and completely unfocused.

55
00:03:51,856 --> 00:03:53,024
I'll pass.

56
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:55,568
Oh... who's unfocused?

57
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:57,404
Ah!

58
00:03:57,445 --> 00:03:59,614
-Hello, Ritsu. Nice to see you.
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry...

59
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:02,075
[Ritsu]
Hey. I saw you two from outside
and decided to come in.

60
00:04:02,117 --> 00:04:04,744
- So, you're by yourself today?
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry...

61
00:04:04,786 --> 00:04:07,497
Mmhm, Mio's off taking
some summer classes.

62
00:04:07,539 --> 00:04:10,709
You mean you don't have to
go to any, Ritsu-senpai?

63
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,085
What? Who, me?

64
00:04:12,127 --> 00:04:14,462
Summer classes? What for?

65
00:04:15,213 --> 00:04:17,799
What was I thinking?

66
00:04:17,841 --> 00:04:18,883
Oh, that reminds me.

67
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:21,052
I've been meaning to
ask you something.

68
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:23,722
Mugi-senpai brings her own
tea sets to the club room

69
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:26,391
and fancy cakes and
has vacation homes.

70
00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:28,810
Does she come from
a really rich family?

71
00:04:28,852 --> 00:04:31,354
That's for sure!
She even has a butler at home,

72
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:33,356
and her family even leaves
the country sometimes

73
00:04:33,398 --> 00:04:34,983
to go on long vacations!

74
00:04:35,025 --> 00:04:36,317
They really do that?

75
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:38,403
It'd sure be cool
if they did, huh?

76
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:40,530
So you don't know for sure.

77
00:04:40,572 --> 00:04:41,990
Hey, why don't we
give her a call

78
00:04:42,032 --> 00:04:44,075
and go hang out over at
her place for a while!

79
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:47,078
Wait. Are you sure?
It's kind of short notice.

80
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,665
(phone ringing)

81
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:54,210
That's weird, she's not
answering her cell.

82
00:04:54,252 --> 00:04:56,171
I guess I'll try
her home number.

83
00:04:56,212 --> 00:04:58,340
(dialing)

84
00:04:59,215 --> 00:05:00,383
Hmmm...

85
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:01,384
(phone ringing)

86
00:05:01,426 --> 00:05:03,094
(male voice)
Yes, hello?

87
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:04,763
Somebody picked up.

88
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:07,098
Hi! Is this Tsumugi's dad
I'm speaking to?

89
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:11,269
No, I am in the employ of the
Kotobuki family as their butler.

90
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:12,812
Whoa! They really have a butler!

91
00:05:12,854 --> 00:05:16,483
Um, well, um, would Tsumugi
happen to be at home right now?

92
00:05:16,524 --> 00:05:18,276
Senpai, just calm down!

93
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:20,487
I've very sorry,
but I'm afraid Miss Tsumugi

94
00:05:20,528 --> 00:05:22,489
is summering in Finland
at the moment.

95
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:25,658
Oh, she is?
Thank you very much then!

96
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:28,328
Sorry to have bothered you!

97
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:31,706
See! Told you!
It's just exactly like I said.

98
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:32,916
Oh!

99
00:05:32,957 --> 00:05:36,336
(Ritsu groans)
I'm exhausted for some reason...

100
00:05:36,378 --> 00:05:39,839
Want to come over to my house?
We have a nice watermelon.

101
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:41,508
Count me in!

102
00:05:42,092 --> 00:05:43,134
I'm home!

103
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:44,260
You here Sis?

104
00:05:44,302 --> 00:05:45,637
Watermelon...

105
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:48,640
Ritsu and Azusa-chan
decided to come over.

106
00:05:48,682 --> 00:05:51,976
Welcome home, Ui...

107
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:57,190
[Ritsu]
It's strangely soothing...

108
00:05:57,232 --> 00:05:59,734
[Azusa]
It's just like she said...

109
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:03,655
Hello! Excuse us!

110
00:06:03,697 --> 00:06:05,782
[Yui]
There she is!

111
00:06:05,824 --> 00:06:07,534
[Ritsu]
It must be rough
to be a teacher,

112
00:06:07,575 --> 00:06:09,119
and working during
summer break...

113
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:12,288
[Yamanaka]
Yeah, we have to go to
seminars and whatnot...

114
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:13,915
Are you guys practicing?

115
00:06:13,957 --> 00:06:14,958
[Yui]
Yeah!

116
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,543
Did you want something?

117
00:06:16,584 --> 00:06:18,336
[Ritsu]
The Light Music Club is gonna
have a training camp...

118
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:21,047
[Yui]
...and we were all wondering
if you wanted to come.

119
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:22,674
A training camp, huh?

120
00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:25,343
[Ritsu]
She doesn't look too thrilled
about it, does she...

121
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:28,555
Well, fine, I guess,
we'll just go by ourselves.

122
00:06:28,596 --> 00:06:30,432
She gets mad when
we don't ask her,

123
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:32,517
and when we do,
this is her response!

124
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:34,436
Too bad, she could've gone
swimming and had a barbecue.

125
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:35,687
Huh?!

126
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:38,606
I can't wait for
this training camp!

127
00:06:41,443 --> 00:06:42,902
All right!

128
00:06:42,944 --> 00:06:45,155
This is our first time
together for a while,

129
00:06:45,196 --> 00:06:48,408
so why don't we go buy stuff
for the training camp?

130
00:06:49,701 --> 00:06:52,370
Hey, by the way, what are we
all here to buy today?

131
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:54,205
Some brand new gear
for the band?

132
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:55,957
Well, uh...

133
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:57,083
Cute swimsuits!

134
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:58,501
They're ready to goof off!

135
00:06:58,543 --> 00:07:00,628
I had a feeling something
like this would happen.

136
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:03,173
Hey, we're not gonna play
around the whole time.

137
00:07:03,214 --> 00:07:04,174
I can't trust you guys!

138
00:07:04,215 --> 00:07:05,592
How come?!

139
00:07:05,633 --> 00:07:08,470
Hey, we'll have to take
some breaks, too. Right?

140
00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:12,974
Hm? Oh, yeah.
I hadn't thought of that.

141
00:07:13,016 --> 00:07:14,559
(giggles)

142
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:17,604
[Ritsu]
<i>What's this loneliness</i>
<i>I'm feeling?</i>

143
00:07:18,772 --> 00:07:20,148
Oh!

144
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:22,901
[Ritsu]
This one's even more awesome
than the last one!

145
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:24,611
This is the vacation home

146
00:07:24,652 --> 00:07:26,571
you said you couldn't
borrow for us last year?

147
00:07:26,613 --> 00:07:28,031
No, I'm sorry.

148
00:07:28,073 --> 00:07:30,742
That home wasn't available
for us this year, either.

149
00:07:30,784 --> 00:07:32,619
I find this one
rather cramped,

150
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:34,120
but we'll just have to
put up with it.

151
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:36,331
You have an even
bigger one?!

152
00:07:36,373 --> 00:07:39,167
Oh, yeah,
let's have some fun!

153
00:07:39,209 --> 00:07:40,418
Yeah!

154
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,087
Hey!

155
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:44,297
No playing until
after we practice!

156
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:45,423
Aw...

157
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:47,217
We wanna have fun!

158
00:07:47,258 --> 00:07:49,219
All right, majority rules, then.

159
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:51,096
I vote that we
practice first.

160
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:52,097
Play first!

161
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:53,973
I want to practice.

162
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:56,768
I vote for playing.

163
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:58,436
[Mio]
<i>An unexpected betrayal!</i>

164
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:00,105
Hurry up!

165
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:02,982
Wait for me!

166
00:08:03,024 --> 00:08:04,609
[Azusa]
<i>When Mugi-senpai</i>
<i>says "playing,"</i>

167
00:08:04,651 --> 00:08:06,736
<i>I wonder if she means...</i>

168
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:10,198
I'm flying!

169
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,534
Yes, yes, yes!

170
00:08:13,535 --> 00:08:15,829
<i>Naw, that could never happen...</i>

171
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:17,080
Huh?

172
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:22,252
[Mugi]
I told you I didn't need
this stuff, didn't I!

173
00:08:22,293 --> 00:08:25,296
You are to get rid of everything
on the beach this instant!

174
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:27,007
I don't want the yacht, either!

175
00:08:27,048 --> 00:08:27,799
Mugi...

176
00:08:27,841 --> 00:08:28,883
Senpai...

177
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:30,969
Catch!

178
00:08:31,011 --> 00:08:32,387
(laughing)

179
00:08:32,429 --> 00:08:33,471
(sighs)

180
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:35,473
(laughing)

181
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:37,809
(laughing)

182
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:39,769
Back and forth,
back and forth!

183
00:08:39,811 --> 00:08:42,981
<i>Are we ever gonna get</i>
<i>around to practicing?</i>

184
00:08:43,023 --> 00:08:45,650
Azu-nyan!

185
00:08:45,692 --> 00:08:48,153
Why don;t you come and
play with us, Azu-nyan!

186
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:49,571
No, thank you.

187
00:08:49,612 --> 00:08:52,157
I see. You must be pretty
bad at sports, huh?

188
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:53,783
Uh! I am not!

189
00:08:53,825 --> 00:08:56,244
Bring it on and
you'll see what I can do.

190
00:08:57,287 --> 00:08:59,748
(camera clicks)

191
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:06,671
Azusa has fit in with the club,
just fine, hasn't she?

192
00:09:06,713 --> 00:09:09,007
I suppose.

193
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:12,510
[Yui]
Dr. Ritchan, you should
look at this right away!

194
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:14,429
[Ritsu]
A star-sharped extraterrestrial!
[Azusa] Hey, Mio.

195
00:09:14,471 --> 00:09:19,017
You know that old story about
corn barnacles, don't you?

196
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:22,228
A long time ago, a boy cut
his foot on a corn barnacle-

197
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:23,438
(Mio screams)

198
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:26,066
Uh, Mio...
What's the matter?

199
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:27,984
Mio?

200
00:09:29,277 --> 00:09:30,528
Hehe!

201
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:31,780
(giggling)

202
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:33,865
[Yui]
You gotta move up some more!

203
00:09:35,367 --> 00:09:36,993
(laughing)

204
00:09:37,035 --> 00:09:38,578
Wo-hoo!

205
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:39,704
(clapping)
Ah!

206
00:09:39,746 --> 00:09:41,539
- [Yui] Gimme!
- [Azusa] No!

207
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:42,624
(scared)

208
00:09:42,665 --> 00:09:43,667
[Ritsu]
Mio!

209
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:45,669
(laughing)

210
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:47,837
I don't know what got into me-

211
00:09:57,055 --> 00:09:58,890
Mm...

212
00:10:01,184 --> 00:10:02,977
[Yui]
Where am I?

213
00:10:04,479 --> 00:10:06,231
A desert island?

214
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:09,025
(groaning)

215
00:10:10,235 --> 00:10:11,945
Wake up, Ritchan!

216
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:16,116
Yui...

217
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:18,660
Oh!

218
00:10:21,246 --> 00:10:22,706
Y-Yui!

219
00:10:23,373 --> 00:10:24,374
Ritchan!

220
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,752
We did it! We made it!

221
00:10:27,794 --> 00:10:30,046
We got to the new world!

222
00:10:30,088 --> 00:10:33,967
-Zipangu! The land of gold!
-What the heck are they doing?

223
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,053
We're all played out...

224
00:10:37,095 --> 00:10:39,764
Let's all go eat and
then call it a night.

225
00:10:39,806 --> 00:10:41,725
What about
band practice?

226
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:43,810
I knew it!
I knew we should've practiced

227
00:10:43,852 --> 00:10:45,937
instead of playing
around out here!

228
00:10:45,979 --> 00:10:48,565
But you played more
than anybody, Azusa.

229
00:10:48,606 --> 00:10:49,774
You're all sunburnt.

230
00:10:49,816 --> 00:10:52,527
Well, I'm gonna go
practice, too!

231
00:10:52,569 --> 00:10:54,320
All night long?

232
00:10:55,989 --> 00:10:57,657
I will!

233
00:11:04,414 --> 00:11:05,957
K-ON!

234
00:11:08,209 --> 00:11:11,338
[Ritsu]
I'm beat. And I'm starving too.

235
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:12,881
[Mio]
Suck it up.

236
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:17,218
This is awesome!

237
00:11:19,846 --> 00:11:21,264
It's awesome, all right...

238
00:11:21,306 --> 00:11:23,767
I've never used an amp
like that before!

239
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:26,019
Mio, let's hurry up
and practice!

240
00:11:26,061 --> 00:11:27,645
These snares are brand new!

241
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:29,439
<i>Talk about</i>
<i>self-serving.</i>

242
00:11:29,481 --> 00:11:32,484
(tuning up)

243
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:34,319
Azu-nyan, what's that thing?

244
00:11:34,361 --> 00:11:38,114
What? Oh, this?
It's just an electronic tuner.

245
00:11:38,156 --> 00:11:40,825
Really.
What do you use a tuner for?

246
00:11:40,867 --> 00:11:43,703
You use it to
tune your guitar.

247
00:11:43,745 --> 00:11:46,790
Wait a minute. You've never
seen a tuner before?

248
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:48,708
Nope, this is
the first one.

249
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,960
How do you tune
your guitar, then?

250
00:11:51,002 --> 00:11:53,838
Huh? I do it by ear...

251
00:11:54,339 --> 00:11:56,466
See?

252
00:11:56,508 --> 00:11:57,884
<i>Sh-she has perfect pitch!</i>

253
00:11:57,926 --> 00:12:01,429
<i>I have no idea if she's</i>
<i>amazing or not!</i>

254
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:03,807
Right! Here goes!

255
00:12:03,848 --> 00:12:06,226
One, two, three, and four!

256
00:12:09,688 --> 00:12:11,356
(ending a song)

257
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:15,527
Hey! That sounded really
great, didn't it?

258
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:16,986
Yes, it was perfect.

259
00:12:17,028 --> 00:12:18,697
You were great, Yui-chan!

260
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:20,824
<i>I wonder when they</i>
<i>had time to practice?</i>

261
00:12:20,865 --> 00:12:23,952
You set a perfect tempo
for the song, too, Ritsu.

262
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:26,204
Did you do some
cram practicing?

263
00:12:27,539 --> 00:12:31,376
I'm so hungry that I've got
absolutely no energy left...

264
00:12:31,418 --> 00:12:33,545
I guess the hunger made her
loose her extra energy

265
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:35,046
and play better than usual.

266
00:12:35,088 --> 00:12:37,632
Oh... C'mon, let's eat!

267
00:12:37,674 --> 00:12:40,844
Please feed me!

268
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:42,929
Yes, me too!

269
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:44,931
[Yui]
We're back!

270
00:12:44,973 --> 00:12:46,641
[Ritsu]
Welcome back!

271
00:12:46,683 --> 00:12:47,934
[Mugi]
Oh, thanks, Ritsu.

272
00:12:47,976 --> 00:12:49,686
Ritchan! We bring you meat!

273
00:12:49,728 --> 00:12:51,312
And veggies!

274
00:12:51,354 --> 00:12:53,273
Yeah!

275
00:12:53,314 --> 00:12:55,400
A whole head of cabbage!

276
00:12:55,442 --> 00:12:57,068
I'm so hungry, I'll eat it raw!

277
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:59,738
Show a little patience,
all right?

278
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:01,406
<i>They goof off all the time,</i>

279
00:13:01,448 --> 00:13:04,409
<i>but for some reason they</i>
<i>manage to play really well.</i>

280
00:13:04,451 --> 00:13:07,203
Let go! The cabbages!
The god of cabbages is angry!

281
00:13:07,245 --> 00:13:09,873
If we split up the cooking work,
it'll be ready in no time.

282
00:13:09,914 --> 00:13:13,335
I'll light the grill and start
getting everything heated up.

283
00:13:13,376 --> 00:13:17,380
See, our new member is taking
the initiative and working hard.

284
00:13:17,422 --> 00:13:19,257
All right, all right...

285
00:13:19,299 --> 00:13:20,925
(crying)

286
00:13:22,761 --> 00:13:24,637
My eyes are burning!

287
00:13:24,679 --> 00:13:26,931
Yui, sure you can handle it?

288
00:13:27,349 --> 00:13:28,350
Ritchan!

289
00:13:28,391 --> 00:13:29,559
Yui!

290
00:13:29,601 --> 00:13:32,020
When we die,
we die together!

291
00:13:32,062 --> 00:13:33,229
Yes!

292
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:37,150
Ready!

293
00:13:37,192 --> 00:13:38,818
So, why don't we
make some onigiri?

294
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:40,362
Right!

295
00:13:48,787 --> 00:13:50,914
They're so different!

296
00:13:51,289 --> 00:13:52,457
Hm?

297
00:13:52,499 --> 00:13:54,751
I guess it's just that
you have man hands, Mio.

298
00:13:54,793 --> 00:13:55,752
Shut up!

299
00:13:55,794 --> 00:13:58,254
*

300
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:16,481
Ah! That was delicious!

301
00:14:16,523 --> 00:14:17,816
It was terrific!

302
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:19,567
That was awesome all right!

303
00:14:19,609 --> 00:14:20,652
Hey!

304
00:14:20,694 --> 00:14:22,487
Who's for fireworks?

305
00:14:28,535 --> 00:14:30,578
Uh... Oh...

306
00:14:36,501 --> 00:14:38,003
Aw, I burned out.

307
00:14:38,044 --> 00:14:41,047
You know, when a firework
almost burned completely out,

308
00:14:41,089 --> 00:14:43,591
it sort of makes you want
to cheer it on, doesn't it?

309
00:14:43,633 --> 00:14:45,385
You can do it! You can do it!

310
00:14:45,427 --> 00:14:46,302
You can do it!

311
00:14:46,344 --> 00:14:48,138
You can do it! You can do it!

312
00:14:48,179 --> 00:14:50,598
All right, one more time!

313
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,767
You can do it!

314
00:14:52,809 --> 00:14:53,935
You can do it!

315
00:14:53,977 --> 00:14:56,146
(fizzing out)

316
00:14:56,187 --> 00:14:57,522
Ah!

317
00:14:57,564 --> 00:15:00,775
It broke off again.

318
00:15:00,817 --> 00:15:02,861
[Yui]
Ritchan, look, it's going out!

319
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:04,320
[Ritsu]
Right! At times like this,

320
00:15:04,362 --> 00:15:06,781
we have to combine
and get bigger!

321
00:15:06,823 --> 00:15:09,576
[Both]
Combine! Form Sparklerman!

322
00:15:09,617 --> 00:15:11,369
[Mugi]
Hey! No fair!

323
00:15:11,411 --> 00:15:12,787
[Mio]
Morons.

324
00:15:12,829 --> 00:15:14,247
Is that too heavy?

325
00:15:14,289 --> 00:15:15,415
No, I'm fine.

326
00:15:15,457 --> 00:15:16,791
Let's test our bravery!

327
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:18,126
Oh!

328
00:15:18,168 --> 00:15:19,961
If it's not one thing,
it's another...

329
00:15:20,003 --> 00:15:21,212
Why not?!

330
00:15:21,254 --> 00:15:22,797
We have to have to have
a bravery contest,

331
00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:24,174
it's a camp tradition.

332
00:15:24,215 --> 00:15:25,925
Yeah, well I'm not doing it.

333
00:15:25,967 --> 00:15:27,427
Oh, you won't?

334
00:15:27,469 --> 00:15:30,055
You do have a problem
with scary stuff...

335
00:15:30,847 --> 00:15:32,474
I can handle it just fine!

336
00:15:32,515 --> 00:15:34,184
So, bring it on, Ritsu!

337
00:15:34,225 --> 00:15:35,060
Hehe...

338
00:15:35,101 --> 00:15:36,978
<i>Now you're going to pay dearly</i>

339
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:39,439
<i>for making me wait</i>
<i>so long to eat!</i>

340
00:15:39,481 --> 00:15:41,358
(owl hooting)

341
00:15:46,363 --> 00:15:47,280
(bird cries out)

342
00:15:47,322 --> 00:15:48,406
Huh?!

343
00:15:48,448 --> 00:15:50,116
S-seriously, Azusa,

344
00:15:50,158 --> 00:15:53,036
who still has bravery
contests in high school?

345
00:15:53,078 --> 00:15:55,789
Um, you're kind of
hurting my hand.

346
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:57,916
(moaning)

347
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:01,044
I wonder what that is?

348
00:16:01,086 --> 00:16:04,089
I-I bet it's R-Ritsu
up to her usual tricks!

349
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:07,467
(moaning)

350
00:16:10,887 --> 00:16:13,264
(moaning)

351
00:16:16,142 --> 00:16:17,894
Mio-chan...

352
00:16:17,936 --> 00:16:19,562
(screaming)

353
00:16:19,604 --> 00:16:21,898
Mio! Senpai!

354
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:23,566
Pull it together!

355
00:16:23,608 --> 00:16:25,527
(moaning)

356
00:16:25,568 --> 00:16:27,070
Ms. Yamanaka!

357
00:16:27,112 --> 00:16:28,738
What are you doing here?!

358
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:31,533
I-I finally found you...

359
00:16:31,574 --> 00:16:33,410
Huh? Ms. Yamanaka?

360
00:16:33,451 --> 00:16:36,913
What's wrong and
what are you doing here?

361
00:16:36,955 --> 00:16:39,457
well, my plan was to
catch up with you

362
00:16:39,499 --> 00:16:43,503
and then surprise you all
by my sudden arrival.

363
00:16:43,545 --> 00:16:45,046
But I got lost.

364
00:16:45,088 --> 00:16:47,924
It looks like you succeeded
in surprising us, anyway.

365
00:16:47,966 --> 00:16:49,342
Regardless of how lost you got.

366
00:16:49,384 --> 00:16:52,554
Mio-chan! Everything's
all right! Mio-chan!

367
00:16:52,595 --> 00:16:56,516
<i>I had no idea Mio got</i>
<i>frightened so easily.</i>

368
00:16:56,558 --> 00:16:58,601
(hooting)

369
00:17:02,605 --> 00:17:05,025
Nobody's coming...

370
00:17:09,237 --> 00:17:10,780
That was total hell...

371
00:17:10,822 --> 00:17:12,032
Now, now...

372
00:17:12,073 --> 00:17:13,616
Oh, Mio! Mio!

373
00:17:19,164 --> 00:17:21,541
Azusa, don't you
like hot water?

374
00:17:21,583 --> 00:17:23,877
Huh? No, that's not it.

375
00:17:23,918 --> 00:17:25,712
Azu-nyan, at times like this,

376
00:17:25,754 --> 00:17:28,590
it's best to just
get it over with!

377
00:17:29,758 --> 00:17:31,092
Ow!

378
00:17:31,134 --> 00:17:33,219
Oh, was it because
you are sunburned, huh?

379
00:17:33,261 --> 00:17:35,472
[Mugi]
Yui-chan, have you
lost weight?

380
00:17:35,513 --> 00:17:36,973
[Yui]
Huh? No.

381
00:17:37,015 --> 00:17:38,600
Didn't I tell you before?

382
00:17:38,641 --> 00:17:41,770
I can eat all I want, and I
never gain any weight at all.

383
00:17:41,811 --> 00:17:43,438
[Others]
I'm so jealous!

384
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:46,816
[Yui]
What? You, too, Ms. Yamanaka?!

385
00:17:46,858 --> 00:17:48,985
You know what, it's strange,

386
00:17:49,027 --> 00:17:50,945
but I really can't tell
the two of you apart

387
00:17:50,987 --> 00:17:53,490
without my glasses on.

388
00:17:56,034 --> 00:18:00,038
I guess I'll have to tell you
apart based on bust size!

389
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,456
(thud)

390
00:18:06,336 --> 00:18:08,630
(crickets chirping)

391
00:18:13,927 --> 00:18:17,013
(sleeping grumbles)

392
00:18:18,181 --> 00:18:20,558
Gimme the cabbage...!

393
00:18:22,727 --> 00:18:24,688
(flushing)

394
00:18:32,696 --> 00:18:34,572
Uh?

395
00:18:34,614 --> 00:18:37,033
(guitar notes)

396
00:18:39,828 --> 00:18:43,581
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to
make you practice with me.

397
00:18:43,623 --> 00:18:45,667
Don't worry about it, Yui.
It's all right.

398
00:18:45,709 --> 00:18:48,378
I've been hoping that I
might get a chance sometime

399
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:51,089
to practice with you anyway.

400
00:18:51,131 --> 00:18:52,549
Aw. Thanks a lot!

401
00:18:53,091 --> 00:18:55,093
Let's see...

402
00:18:56,553 --> 00:18:58,638
(playing notes)

403
00:19:07,564 --> 00:19:09,274
Ah...

404
00:19:09,315 --> 00:19:11,359
Azu-nyan, you're really good!

405
00:19:11,401 --> 00:19:15,363
Huh? Oh, no, not at all!

406
00:19:15,405 --> 00:19:18,199
Now it's my turn
to give it a try.

407
00:19:18,241 --> 00:19:20,785
(playing notes)

408
00:19:24,289 --> 00:19:26,583
Wow, this part is
really tough.

409
00:19:26,624 --> 00:19:30,420
Maybe you should playing it
at a slower tempo at first.

410
00:19:30,462 --> 00:19:31,838
Like this?

411
00:19:47,562 --> 00:19:49,314
I did it!

412
00:19:50,106 --> 00:19:52,442
Azu-nyan, I'm so glad I met you!

413
00:19:53,735 --> 00:19:55,653
Azu-nyan!

414
00:19:58,114 --> 00:19:59,991
Thank you so much, Azu-nyan!

415
00:20:00,033 --> 00:20:02,160
(giggles)

416
00:20:02,952 --> 00:20:05,455
*

417
00:20:14,839 --> 00:20:16,758
<i>Hello, Ui Hirasawa here.</i>

418
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:20,428
<i>I'm hanging out with</i>
<i>Azusa-chan again today.</i>

419
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:21,805
Hey!

420
00:20:24,474 --> 00:20:26,726
Hi, Ui! Sorry I'm late!

421
00:20:26,768 --> 00:20:28,812
Hi! What kept you?

422
00:20:28,853 --> 00:20:30,647
Wait, who are you?

423
00:20:30,689 --> 00:20:33,024
Ah!

424
00:20:33,066 --> 00:20:36,027
So I guess you didn't get
in much practicing, huh?

425
00:20:36,069 --> 00:20:37,987
We did practice some,

426
00:20:38,029 --> 00:20:41,324
but I was expecting more
intensive training or something.

427
00:20:41,366 --> 00:20:43,284
We basically goofed off
most of the time,

428
00:20:43,326 --> 00:20:45,036
swimming and
stuff like that.

429
00:20:45,078 --> 00:20:46,287
Hm...

430
00:20:46,329 --> 00:20:48,665
But I wanted to
practice a lot more!

431
00:20:48,707 --> 00:20:49,791
I see.

432
00:20:49,833 --> 00:20:52,002
Wait a minute, that's weird,

433
00:20:52,043 --> 00:20:53,503
my sister wasn't tan at all.

434
00:20:53,545 --> 00:20:55,797
How did you get so sunburned?

435
00:20:55,839 --> 00:20:57,799
Oh, um...

436
00:20:57,841 --> 00:21:01,386
Because I played around
more than anyone else.

437
00:21:02,846 --> 00:21:04,347
(giggle)

438
00:21:04,973 --> 00:21:06,683
Still, though...

439
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:11,646
I'm really happy I went.

440
00:21:13,023 --> 00:21:16,234
I learned lots of things
about the others in the club.

441
00:21:16,276 --> 00:21:18,403
Yeah? what kind of things?

442
00:21:18,445 --> 00:21:22,782
Well, like Mio is more of
a scaredy-cat than you'd expect.

443
00:21:22,824 --> 00:21:26,161
Oh, she is?
What about Ritsu?

444
00:21:26,202 --> 00:21:28,747
Well, she is
unfocused and all,

445
00:21:28,788 --> 00:21:31,416
but she and Mio
are great together.

446
00:21:31,458 --> 00:21:33,168
And what about Mugi?

447
00:21:33,209 --> 00:21:36,087
Let's see, Mugi is
sweet and generous

448
00:21:36,129 --> 00:21:38,089
and is always
thinking about others,

449
00:21:38,131 --> 00:21:39,966
and she's got a
childlike side to her

450
00:21:40,008 --> 00:21:41,760
that's fun and really cute.

451
00:21:41,801 --> 00:21:43,011
Oh...

452
00:21:43,053 --> 00:21:45,472
Okay, what about my sister?

453
00:21:46,681 --> 00:21:48,683
Well, Yui is...

454
00:21:50,185 --> 00:21:51,978
She buckled down
and practiced!

455
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:54,230
I knew it!

456
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:05,367
But...

457
00:22:07,744 --> 00:22:08,912
Ah...

458
00:22:08,953 --> 00:22:11,706
She still stays glommed
onto me all the time.

459
00:22:11,748 --> 00:22:15,877
She's warm and sweet,
isn't she?

460
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:19,005
Hehe...
You know, she is.

461
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:22,425
("Don't say 'lazy'" plays)

462
00:23:51,264 --> 00:23:53,099
These strings are all corroded!

463
00:23:54,517 --> 00:23:55,810
When was the last time

464
00:23:55,852 --> 00:23:57,645
you changed them out
for new ones, Yui?

465
00:23:57,687 --> 00:24:00,940
Huh? You mean you're supposed
to change the strings?

466
00:24:01,858 --> 00:24:02,734
What?

467
00:24:02,776 --> 00:24:05,653
Is this a vintage guitar?

468
00:24:05,695 --> 00:24:08,740
No, we're sorry. It's just
kind of dirty, that's all.

469
00:24:08,782 --> 00:24:10,700
It's been a year since
I bought it!

470
00:24:10,742 --> 00:24:14,996
What if she decides not to come
back to the club anymore...

471
00:24:15,038 --> 00:24:19,626
What will happen to our concert
at the school festival?
