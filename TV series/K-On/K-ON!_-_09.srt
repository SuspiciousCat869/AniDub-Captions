[Yui]
<i>Our long sought-after</i>
<i>new member</i>

2
00:00:09,759 --> 00:00:12,804
<i>has finally arrived to join us</i>
<i>at the Light Music Club!</i>

3
00:00:12,846 --> 00:00:15,056
Welcome to the
Light Music Club!

4
00:00:15,098 --> 00:00:17,934
Hey, don't just stand there!
Come in!

5
00:00:17,976 --> 00:00:19,477
(giggling)

6
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:21,813
All right, now tell us,
what's your name?

7
00:00:21,855 --> 00:00:23,023
Uh, my name is Azusa.

8
00:00:23,064 --> 00:00:24,566
So, what instrument
do you play?

9
00:00:24,607 --> 00:00:25,525
Well, I play--

10
00:00:25,567 --> 00:00:27,152
So, what's your
favorite food?!

11
00:00:27,193 --> 00:00:29,696
-What's your favorite color?
-Calm down, people.

12
00:00:30,447 --> 00:00:32,782
("Cagayake! Girls" plays)

13
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:06,459
Um, I'm Azusa Nakano,
year 1, class 2,

14
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:08,962
and I play a
little bit of guitar.

15
00:02:09,004 --> 00:02:10,755
Hey, just like Yui does, huh?

16
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:14,426
I look forward to playing
with you, Yui-senpai.

17
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:15,093
Oh!

18
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:16,928
Yui-senpai...

19
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:18,638
Senpai!

20
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,015
Senpai!

21
00:02:20,056 --> 00:02:22,475
Hey! Come back
to Planet Earth!

22
00:02:22,517 --> 00:02:24,310
*

23
00:02:27,022 --> 00:02:30,483
For starters, try playing
something for us!

24
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:32,318
I'm still a beginner,

25
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,695
so I'm not very good yet.

26
00:02:33,737 --> 00:02:34,821
No problem!

27
00:02:34,863 --> 00:02:36,865
I'm gonna teach you
everything I know!

28
00:02:36,906 --> 00:02:40,201
Wow, you're starting to act
like a senpai already.

29
00:02:40,243 --> 00:02:42,912
Uh, well, here goes.

30
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:47,709
(shredding on the guitar)

31
00:02:50,337 --> 00:02:51,880
Sh-she's great!

32
00:02:51,921 --> 00:02:53,840
She's way better than I am!

33
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,261
<i>Uh-oh. What should I do?</i>

34
00:02:58,303 --> 00:03:00,305
<i>They're acting strange</i>
<i>all of a sudden.</i>

35
00:03:00,347 --> 00:03:03,308
<i>I bet it was because</i>
<i>I played so badly.</i>

36
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:04,976
I'm so sorry!

37
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:06,644
My playing must have been
awful to listen to.

38
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:10,231
No, that's not why
we reacted like that!

39
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:12,692
Y-you have a ways to go!

40
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:13,610
Huh?!

41
00:03:13,651 --> 00:03:14,861
What's with you?

42
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:17,822
Yui, how long are you
gonna keep acting cocky?

43
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:19,657
Uh!

44
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:20,492
Oh!

45
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:21,576
Ah!

46
00:03:21,618 --> 00:03:23,328
Yui-senpai, I would
really love to hear

47
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:25,038
you play the guitar again!

48
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,331
Huh? Uh...

49
00:03:26,373 --> 00:03:29,668
Oh. Um...

50
00:03:30,293 --> 00:03:31,336
Ugh!

51
00:03:31,378 --> 00:03:32,629
I threw my back out

52
00:03:32,671 --> 00:03:35,006
during the show,
so maybe later, okay?

53
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:36,132
<i>Lame.</i>

54
00:03:36,174 --> 00:03:38,510
Whatever. Just move it.

55
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:40,804
Well, in any event,
I guess we can assume

56
00:03:40,845 --> 00:03:43,473
that you're going to be
joining the club, right?

57
00:03:43,515 --> 00:03:44,849
Yes!

58
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:46,851
I was very moved and excited
when I heard you all play

59
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:48,353
at the welcoming ceremony!

60
00:03:48,395 --> 00:03:51,856
I look forward to
playing with you.

61
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:55,276
She's so dazzling,
I can't even look at her!

62
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:57,612
Oh, that's right.

63
00:03:59,823 --> 00:04:01,199
My application form.

64
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:03,576
Duly received and accepted.

65
00:04:03,618 --> 00:04:05,662
So, we'll see you
here tomorrow, then.

66
00:04:05,704 --> 00:04:09,666
You will. I guess
I better get going now.

67
00:04:13,044 --> 00:04:14,921
Oh, no!
What am I gonna do?!

68
00:04:14,963 --> 00:04:16,923
Go start practicing.

69
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:23,972
Hello, everyone!

70
00:04:24,014 --> 00:04:25,765
Well, someone's awfully cheery!

71
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:29,310
Yes, the end of the school day
couldn't come fast enough.

72
00:04:29,352 --> 00:04:30,937
Let's get to it, then!

73
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:32,105
To practice you mean?

74
00:04:32,147 --> 00:04:33,606
No, have tea.

75
00:04:33,648 --> 00:04:34,566
Eh?!

76
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:36,693
[Mugi]
Here's a cup for you, Azusa.

77
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:38,236
Are you sure?

78
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:40,113
I mean, is it okay
for us to have tea

79
00:04:40,155 --> 00:04:41,740
in the Music Room
like this?

80
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:44,451
Yeah. Don't sweat it,
it's fine!

81
00:04:45,076 --> 00:04:46,411
Uh...

82
00:04:47,037 --> 00:04:49,289
(nervous)

83
00:04:53,168 --> 00:04:54,919
Um, Ma'am, this isn't--

84
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:57,088
I'll have milk
with my tea.

85
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:59,215
Huh?!

86
00:04:59,257 --> 00:05:01,509
I'm Ms. Yamanaka,
your advisor.

87
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:03,011
Nice to meet you.

88
00:05:03,053 --> 00:05:05,638
It's nice to meet you, too.

89
00:05:07,182 --> 00:05:08,933
[Azusa]
<i>Wow, she sure is pretty...</i>

90
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:11,561
[Yamanaka]
<i>I think she'd</i>
<i>look good in cat ears.</i>

91
00:05:11,603 --> 00:05:13,271
Have some sweets, too.

92
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:14,356
Sure!

93
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:15,940
They look just as good
as always!

94
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:17,776
[Yamanaka]
So, you have a new member.

95
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:19,486
Spring has come,
all right.

96
00:05:19,527 --> 00:05:21,613
[Ritsu]
So, did you get yourself
a boyfriend yet?

97
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:24,449
Don't bring that up!
It's none of your business!

98
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:26,076
All right, sorry.

99
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:29,162
[Azusa]
<i>This is the Light</i>
<i>Music Club, isn't it?</i>

100
00:05:29,204 --> 00:05:33,792
<i>Oh, maybe they're testing me</i>
<i>to see if I have initiative.</i>

101
00:05:34,876 --> 00:05:35,710
(plays guitar)

102
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:36,878
QUIET!

103
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:37,754
Ah!

104
00:05:37,796 --> 00:05:39,506
Uh...

105
00:05:40,965 --> 00:05:43,343
(heavy breathing)

106
00:05:43,385 --> 00:05:45,553
Ms. Yamanaka, you moron!

107
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:49,307
I just, I just wanted to
enjoy my tea in peace.

108
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:51,309
Maybe, but there's a
right way to say things.

109
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:52,727
(crying)

110
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:56,106
Hey, sorry. Ms. Yamanaka's
a little bit strange.

111
00:05:56,147 --> 00:05:57,315
Heard that.

112
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:58,525
Don't let her get to you.

113
00:05:58,566 --> 00:06:00,777
C'mon, let's eat some cake!

114
00:06:00,819 --> 00:06:01,986
(crying)

115
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:04,989
Teatime is our main
selling point, after all.

116
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:06,241
(crying)

117
00:06:06,282 --> 00:06:07,534
Azusa-chan?

118
00:06:07,575 --> 00:06:09,994
It's not supposed to
be like this!

119
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:11,329
She's flipped out!

120
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:13,456
I'm don't sense any motivation
from any of you!

121
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:16,292
Um, well, our welcome show
is over, so--

122
00:06:16,334 --> 00:06:18,003
That has nothing
to do with it!

123
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:19,671
It's wrong for you to
treat the Music Room

124
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:21,172
as your personal property!

125
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:23,299
You should get rid of
all these tea sets!

126
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:24,467
Ah!

127
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:26,052
No, please!
Anything but that!

128
00:06:26,094 --> 00:06:28,722
You're a teacher!
How can you say that?!

129
00:06:28,763 --> 00:06:30,849
Look, let's all
calm down, and--

130
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:33,393
How do you expect me
to be calm, huh?!

131
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,020
Uh?

132
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:36,688
That's a good girl...

133
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:39,274
Petting her isn't
going to calm her...

134
00:06:39,315 --> 00:06:41,443
<i>It calmed her down!</i>

135
00:06:42,527 --> 00:06:44,696
I'm so sorry
I lost my composure.

136
00:06:44,738 --> 00:06:48,074
Oh, that's okay,
we don't mind at all.

137
00:06:48,116 --> 00:06:49,576
That's a problem too.

138
00:06:49,617 --> 00:06:52,537
No, Azusa, you have
a very good point.

139
00:06:52,579 --> 00:06:53,538
Uh...

140
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:54,789
We really ought to show

141
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:56,916
a little more
motivation around here.

142
00:06:56,958 --> 00:06:59,210
We clear on that?!

143
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:00,378
Yeah...

144
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:02,088
Mm-hm.

145
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:05,717
(sigh)

146
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:10,221
(screams)

147
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:11,598
<i>I don't really want to go,</i>

148
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:14,434
<i>not after that scene</i>
<i>I caused...</i>

149
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:18,229
Hi, everyone... Huh!

150
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:20,607
<i>They aren't fazed at all!</i>

151
00:07:21,232 --> 00:07:22,692
Uh...

152
00:07:23,777 --> 00:07:26,571
W-we were all just about
to start band practice!

153
00:07:26,613 --> 00:07:28,615
Honest, we were!

154
00:07:30,784 --> 00:07:31,910
(playing a few notes)

155
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:33,453
Uh...

156
00:07:34,329 --> 00:07:35,747
<i>That was fast!</i>

157
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:38,625
I just don't have any energy
if I don't eat cake...

158
00:07:38,667 --> 00:07:40,543
Here. Have a bite.

159
00:07:40,585 --> 00:07:42,087
Hm? Aaah...

160
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:42,962
Oh!

161
00:07:43,004 --> 00:07:45,256
She's good!

162
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:47,592
Ah...

163
00:07:47,634 --> 00:07:49,636
Why don't you have some,
Azusa-chan.

164
00:07:49,678 --> 00:07:51,012
It's really good.

00:07:51,054 --> 00:07:52,931

166
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:54,182
Uh...

167
00:07:54,224 --> 00:07:55,392
Go on.

168
00:07:55,433 --> 00:07:56,935
Um...

169
00:07:56,976 --> 00:07:58,478
Aah...

170
00:08:01,272 --> 00:08:02,232
Tasty.

171
00:08:02,273 --> 00:08:04,109
Hm! What did say?

172
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:06,403
I said "wasty"!
A waste!

173
00:08:06,444 --> 00:08:07,696
Haha...

174
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:10,865
Oh, I guess she really
didn't like it?

175
00:08:12,075 --> 00:08:12,909
Oh...

176
00:08:12,951 --> 00:08:14,119
Hm...

177
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:16,121
Try this.

178
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:17,789
Ah!

179
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:18,456
Oh...

180
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:19,332
Try it!

181
00:08:19,374 --> 00:08:20,417
Ah!

182
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:21,251

Hi, girls!
Are you practicing hard?

192
00:08:42,731 --> 00:08:45,275
Oh come on, you're eating!

193
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:50,697
Mmm...

194
00:08:54,409 --> 00:08:57,328
Now I can die happy.

195

Please don't.

196
00:08:58,705 --> 00:09:01,541
So, tell me, why did
you decide against

197
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:04,544
getting rid of all
the tea sets?

198
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:06,963
W-well, because...

199
00:09:08,798 --> 00:09:11,968
I thought it was wrong of me
to reject everything,

200
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:13,303
since I'm new.

201
00:09:14,304 --> 00:09:16,181
-Oh!
-(sigh)

202
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:19,351
So, when did you start
playing guitar, Azusa-chan?

203
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:22,604
Let's see, around
4th grade, I guess.

204
00:09:22,645 --> 00:09:24,356
My parents play
in a jazz band,

205
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:25,899
so I was really
influenced by that.

206
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:29,069
That means you're not
a beginner at all!

207
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:30,528
Hehe...

208
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,697
I'm curious what it was

209
00:09:32,739 --> 00:09:36,368
that got you interested in
playing guitar, Yui-senpai?

210
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:37,994
(gulp)
Who, me?

211
00:09:38,036 --> 00:09:39,829
(Whistling)
<i>I can't say it!</i>

212
00:09:39,871 --> 00:09:41,581
<i>I can't tell her I joined</i>

213
00:09:41,623 --> 00:09:44,334
<i>because I thought the club</i>
<i>played lighthearted music!</i>

214
00:09:44,376 --> 00:09:45,669
Anyway, it sure is great

215
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:47,545
that a new member has
joined the club!

216
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:48,546
<i>She dodged it!</i>

217
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:50,215
Almost forgot!

218
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:53,927
I brought a welcome to the club
present for you, Azusa-chan!

219
00:09:53,968 --> 00:09:54,928
Ah...

220
00:09:54,969 --> 00:09:56,721
Ta-dah!

221
00:09:57,639 --> 00:09:59,432
So, um, what exactly are those?

222
00:09:59,474 --> 00:10:01,559
They're cat ears,
of course.

223
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:03,561
I can see that.
That's not what I meant.

224
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:07,023
What am I supposed
to do with them?

225

Hehehe...

It's okay, don't worry.

227
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:14,739
It's kind of a Light
Music Club ritual.

Of course I do!

232
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:25,208
The rest of you think this
is embarrassing, too, right?

233
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:26,418
So...?

234
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:27,711

Next, put on this outfit!

257

Um, okay.

Yeah, I guess.

So, what's the
emergency meeting about?

306
00:13:25,597 --> 00:13:27,807
[Mio]
We have a brand new member,

307
00:13:27,849 --> 00:13:29,392
so I think we're
asking for trouble

308
00:13:29,434 --> 00:13:32,437
if we keep goofing off
like this all the time.

309

Y-you do?

310
00:13:34,981 --> 00:13:36,316
If we keep this up,

311
00:13:36,358 --> 00:13:38,234
Azusa might get
tired of it and quit!

312
00:13:38,276 --> 00:13:39,319
Ah...

313
00:13:39,361 --> 00:13:41,988
I don't want Azu-nyan
to stop coming!

314
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:44,616
Then have no choice.
We have to find some dirt--

OW!

316
00:13:46,284 --> 00:13:48,745
Maybe we should try coming up
with a proper activities plan.

317
00:13:48,787 --> 00:13:50,997
An activities plan?

318

She has a point.
For starters...

319
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:57,545
Oh! Let's throw a
welcome party for Azusa!

Good idea!

C'mon, Azu-nyan, eat up!
There's plenty!

Cut that out!

330
00:14:17,232 --> 00:14:17,941
Mmm...

331
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:19,025
Uh...

332
00:14:19,067 --> 00:14:22,112
You like taiyaki?

333
00:14:22,153 --> 00:14:23,571
Um-hm.

334
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:27,701
Hey! Watch where you're
throwing, you idiot!

335
00:14:27,742 --> 00:14:29,994
You can do it, Ritchan!

336
00:14:30,704 --> 00:14:32,622
(Azusa sighs)

337
00:14:32,664 --> 00:14:34,124
<i>Mio is a great bassist,</i>

338
00:14:34,165 --> 00:14:38,420
<i>so why is she in such</i>
<i>an unmotivated club?</i>

339
00:14:38,461 --> 00:14:40,422
Hm? What is it?

340
00:14:40,463 --> 00:14:42,257
Um, nothing.

341
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:47,220
Uh, Mio, do you
play in any bands

342
00:14:47,262 --> 00:14:49,597
outside the
Light Music Club?

343
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:51,099
Oh...

344
00:14:52,934 --> 00:14:55,603
Hm, playing in a band
outside the club

345
00:14:55,645 --> 00:14:57,022
would be fun, all right.

346
00:14:57,063 --> 00:14:59,482
Oh, are you sure you want to
be say things like that?

347
00:14:59,524 --> 00:15:01,735
Oh! Wh-what's that
a picture of?!

348
00:15:01,776 --> 00:15:03,194
Let me see it!
What is it?!

349
00:15:03,236 --> 00:15:06,781
<i>Is she being</i>
<i>blackmailed into staying?</i>

350
00:15:06,823 --> 00:15:08,533
The bunny look works, too.

351
00:15:08,575 --> 00:15:09,492
Ah!

352
00:15:09,534 --> 00:15:11,578
Hi, Ms. Yamanaka!

353
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:13,455
Sorry I'm late everyone.

354
00:15:13,496 --> 00:15:17,167
I had a few things
to get together first.

355
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:18,084
Ta-dah!

356
00:15:18,126 --> 00:15:20,170
Oh! It's so sweet!

357
00:15:20,211 --> 00:15:22,047
Yeah.
Awesome as always.

358
00:15:22,088 --> 00:15:24,174
Azu-nyan, if you don't
want to wear them,

359
00:15:24,215 --> 00:15:25,800
we'll be happy to!

360
00:15:25,842 --> 00:15:28,386
Th-that's not the problem...

361
00:15:29,304 --> 00:15:31,264
[Yui]
That was so much fun!

362
00:15:31,306 --> 00:15:33,641
[Ritsu]
So, where should we
go next time?

363
00:15:33,683 --> 00:15:35,310
Why don't we
go to the zoo?

364
00:15:35,352 --> 00:15:37,270
A hot spring
would be nice, too.

365
00:15:37,312 --> 00:15:38,980
[Yui]
Oh! Good idea!

366
00:15:39,022 --> 00:15:40,982
[Mugi]
Yes, it's a wonderful idea!

367
00:15:41,024 --> 00:15:42,442
[Yamanaka]
You think so?

368
00:15:42,484 --> 00:15:43,985
You really want to
go to one next time?

369
00:15:44,027 --> 00:15:45,362
Listen up, everyone!

370
00:15:45,403 --> 00:15:46,237
Oh?

371
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:48,073
We're the Light Music Club!

372
00:15:48,114 --> 00:15:49,866
Starting tomorrow,
we're going to practice!

373
00:15:49,908 --> 00:15:51,076
Is that clear?!

374
00:15:51,117 --> 00:15:54,204
No ifs, ands, or buts!
You got it!

375
00:15:54,829 --> 00:15:56,873
Mm-hmm!

376
00:15:56,915 --> 00:15:58,208
[Ritsu]
Okay,

377
00:15:58,249 --> 00:16:00,377
we're suppose to be
the Light Music Club,

378
00:16:00,418 --> 00:16:02,128
even though you may
have all forgotten!

379
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:04,547
Yeah, well,
I remember just fine.

380
00:16:04,589 --> 00:16:05,924
Today, we're gonna practice!

381
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:07,717
[Yui, Mugi, Yamanaka]
Yeah!

382
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:09,386
[Mio, Azusa]
Y-yeah...

383
00:16:09,427 --> 00:16:13,098
[Ritsu]
Okay now, since we have
Yui and Azusa on guitar now,

384
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:15,433
that oughta widen
our range quite a bit.

385
00:16:15,475 --> 00:16:17,894
Who wants to play
lead guitar?

386
00:16:17,936 --> 00:16:19,646
Well, the lead guitarist
should be--

387
00:16:19,688 --> 00:16:21,022
Me! Me!
I want to do it!

388
00:16:21,064 --> 00:16:23,608
<i>Where's this confidence</i>
<i>coming from?</i>

389
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:24,818
Harumph!

390
00:16:24,859 --> 00:16:26,152
(clears throat)

391
00:16:26,194 --> 00:16:28,279
I suppose it would make
more sense to decide

392
00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:30,782
after we hear you
both play.

393
00:16:30,824 --> 00:16:34,077
(Yui moans)

394
00:16:34,119 --> 00:16:36,746
Um, I guess I'll
go first, then.

395
00:16:36,788 --> 00:16:39,165
(shredding on guitar)

396
00:16:42,127 --> 00:16:43,712
Azusa is terrific.

397
00:16:43,753 --> 00:16:45,964
She's a great player.

398
00:16:46,798 --> 00:16:48,591
Okay, Yui--

399
00:16:48,633 --> 00:16:50,802
I threw out my back!

400
00:16:50,844 --> 00:16:52,429
Give it a rest, already!

401
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:55,140
Azu-nyan, please teach me
how to play guitar!

402
00:16:55,181 --> 00:16:56,891
Whoa! She's quick on her feet!

403
00:16:56,933 --> 00:16:58,435
(Yui playing)

404
00:16:58,476 --> 00:17:01,438
[Azusa]
Um, I think you should
use muting on that part.

405
00:17:01,479 --> 00:17:03,898
And I think that last phrase
would sound better

406
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:05,150
with a little vibrato.

407
00:17:05,191 --> 00:17:09,029
Muting? Vibrato?
What are those?

408
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:11,156
Ah!

409
00:17:11,197 --> 00:17:12,282
Believe it or not,

410
00:17:12,323 --> 00:17:14,159
she's been playing
for a year now.

411
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:17,537
How can she get by without
knowing muting and vibrato?

412
00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:18,997
(Yui playing)

413
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:20,874
Hey, wait. She's using
muting just fine.

414
00:17:20,915 --> 00:17:25,003
Oh, that's what you call that?
So that's muting?

415
00:17:25,045 --> 00:17:26,963
"Muting" is a
fingering technique

416
00:17:27,005 --> 00:17:28,882
where you lightly
touch the strings

417
00:17:28,923 --> 00:17:30,842
to dampen the notes
as you play them.

418
00:17:30,884 --> 00:17:32,594
Yui is the type of person

419
00:17:32,635 --> 00:17:34,971
who doesn't read the manual
when she buys a game.

420
00:17:35,013 --> 00:17:36,973
I can see that.

421
00:17:37,015 --> 00:17:39,351
(stretching)

422
00:17:40,852 --> 00:17:43,480
Could you please put some
royal milk tea on for me?

423
00:17:43,521 --> 00:17:44,814
Oh...

424
00:17:44,856 --> 00:17:47,984
I'm sorry, but today we're
only going to practice.

425
00:17:48,026 --> 00:17:49,986
(whining)

426
00:17:50,028 --> 00:17:52,572
I suppose we can take
a little break.

427
00:17:53,031 --> 00:17:54,616
Ah...

428
00:17:54,657 --> 00:17:57,118
What about practice?!

429
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:59,662
We'll work harder
starting tomorrow.

430
00:17:59,704 --> 00:18:00,997
(sigh)

431
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:02,540
Azu-nyan!

432
00:18:04,876 --> 00:18:06,711
Now say "Ah"!

433
00:18:10,215 --> 00:18:13,301
[Mugi]
I have a personal cup
for you, Azusa-chan.

434
00:18:14,886 --> 00:18:16,054
[Azusa]
<i>This will ruin me.</i>

435
00:18:16,096 --> 00:18:18,473
<i>If I stay here,</i>
<i>it will ruin me!</i>

436
00:18:20,308 --> 00:18:23,728
*(melancholy music)*

437
00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:30,652
<i>I should play in other bands</i>
<i>outside the Light Music Club.</i>

438
00:18:30,694 --> 00:18:34,364
<i>There have to be other</i>
<i>great bands out there.</i>

439
00:18:41,121 --> 00:18:42,664
<i>I don't get it.</i>

440
00:18:43,415 --> 00:18:44,708
<i>All these other bands</i>

441
00:18:44,749 --> 00:18:47,293
<i>are better than</i>
<i>the Light Music Club.</i>

442
00:18:52,048 --> 00:18:54,426
(audience cheering)

443
00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:00,598
<i>So why?</i>

444
00:19:13,278 --> 00:19:16,239
Azu-nyan hasn't come
in a while.

445
00:19:16,281 --> 00:19:18,616
She might not come back.

446
00:19:23,747 --> 00:19:27,125
Azusa! Why haven't you
come to the club lately?!

447
00:19:27,167 --> 00:19:30,378
We've been practicing every
day since you were here last!

448
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:33,131
We've been waiting
for you to come back!

449
00:19:33,173 --> 00:19:34,924
Uh... Something wrong?

450
00:19:34,966 --> 00:19:38,428
You didn't just come to
tell us that you're quitting?

451
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:40,930
No way, please,
anything but that!

452
00:19:40,972 --> 00:19:43,808
(crying)
I don't know anymore...

453
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:45,310
Huh?

454
00:19:45,352 --> 00:19:49,731
I don't know why I wanted to
join your club anymore.

455
00:19:49,773 --> 00:19:54,444
Or why your show touched me
so much in the way it did.

456
00:19:54,486 --> 00:19:56,529
I thought that I could
figure it out

457
00:19:56,571 --> 00:19:58,948
if I hung around you
for a little while...

458
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:02,619
...but I just don't
know anymore!

459
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:04,120
Azu-nyan...

460
00:20:04,162 --> 00:20:06,164
(sobbing)

461
00:20:08,667 --> 00:20:12,170
Right! Let's play a number
for Azusa, then!

462
00:20:12,212 --> 00:20:16,633
Let's make her remember what she
was feeling that day, okay?!

463
00:20:19,678 --> 00:20:21,179
Mm-hm!

464
00:20:25,642 --> 00:20:27,644
(playing music)

465
00:20:30,522 --> 00:20:31,815
Huh?

466
00:20:40,865 --> 00:20:45,662
[Azusa]
<i>Yui-senpai hardly knows</i>
<i>any musical lingo at all.</i>

467
00:20:45,704 --> 00:20:48,832
<i>Ritsu's drumming</i>
<i>is always kind of wild.</i>

468
00:20:50,625 --> 00:20:54,004
<i>So why are their songs so good</i>

469
00:20:54,045 --> 00:20:57,173
<i>when the four of them</i>
<i>play together?</i>

470
00:21:00,927 --> 00:21:02,303
<i>Why?</i>

471
00:21:08,143 --> 00:21:10,145
Azusa.

472
00:21:10,186 --> 00:21:11,813
You asked me the other day

473
00:21:11,855 --> 00:21:14,232
why I don't play in bands
outside the club, remember?

474
00:21:14,274 --> 00:21:17,360
Uh, yeah.

475
00:21:19,863 --> 00:21:24,743
I think it's because
I love being in a band
with these girls.

476
00:21:26,453 --> 00:21:28,329
I bet the others
feel the same.

477
00:21:28,371 --> 00:21:31,666
I think that's why we all
play so well together.

478
00:21:31,708 --> 00:21:33,293
Uh!

479
00:21:34,627 --> 00:21:37,505
C'mon! Play a song
with us, Azusa!

480
00:21:37,547 --> 00:21:40,175
Uh...

481
00:21:40,216 --> 00:21:42,886
All right! I really want to
play music with you guys!

482
00:21:42,927 --> 00:21:44,846
I really do!

483
00:21:44,888 --> 00:21:48,099
Oh, what a relief!

484
00:21:48,141 --> 00:21:50,018
Now, I know there's
gonna be times

485
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:52,687
when we're gonna slack off
and drink tea or whatever,

486
00:21:52,729 --> 00:21:56,608
but I think that time
is crucial for us.

487
00:21:59,944 --> 00:22:00,862
(gulp)

488
00:22:00,904 --> 00:22:02,072
I'm so burned out...

489
00:22:02,113 --> 00:22:03,490
I don't think
I'm gonna want to play

490
00:22:03,531 --> 00:22:05,867
for at least a whole week...

491
00:22:06,534 --> 00:22:08,119
Are they serious?

492
00:22:08,161 --> 00:22:09,662
Probably.

493
00:22:09,704 --> 00:22:12,040
[Yui]
Azu-nyan, why don't you
try on those cat ears!

494
00:22:12,082 --> 00:22:13,792
[Azusa]
Huh? What? No way!

495
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:16,127
[Yui]
Please? It'll make me
try harder!

496
00:22:16,169 --> 00:22:17,462
[Azusa]
Oh.

497
00:22:17,504 --> 00:22:20,340
[Yui]
The power of cute compels you!

498
00:22:20,382 --> 00:22:22,509
("Don't say 'lazy'" plays)

499
00:23:52,849 --> 00:23:54,351
[Ritsu]
It must be rough
to be a teacher

500
00:23:54,392 --> 00:23:56,102
and working during
summer break...

501
00:23:56,144 --> 00:23:59,147
[Yamanaka]
Yeah, we have to go to
seminars and whatnot...

502
00:23:59,189 --> 00:24:00,815
Are you guys practicing?

503
00:24:00,857 --> 00:24:01,858
[Yui] Yeah!

504
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:03,818
[Yamanaka]
Did you want something?

505
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:05,487
[Ritsu]
The Light Music Club is
gonna have a training camp.

506
00:24:05,528 --> 00:24:07,614
[Yui]
We were all wondering
if you wanted to come.

507
00:24:07,655 --> 00:24:09,824
A training camp, huh?

508
00:24:09,866 --> 00:24:12,035
[Ritsu]
She doesn't look too thrilled
about it, does she?

509
00:24:12,077 --> 00:24:15,538
[Azusa]
Are we ever gonna get
around to practicing?

510
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:17,582
[Yui]
Azu-nyan!

511
00:24:17,624 --> 00:24:20,043
[Ritsu]
Gimme the cabbage!
