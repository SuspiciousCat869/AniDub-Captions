1
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:03,535
The bomb is set to blow at eight sharp.

2
00:00:03,821 --> 00:00:06,230
We have to personally retrieve it before then.

3
00:00:06,255 --> 00:00:08,325
What is this, Mission: Impossible?

4
00:00:09,667 --> 00:00:12,248
It's her. She's back.

5
00:00:19,036 --> 00:00:21,621
You pulled us off the bomb so they could deal with it!

6
00:00:21,693 --> 00:00:24,363
I was given every assurance they would.

7
00:00:25,385 --> 00:00:27,613
Hey, Nine, is this?

8
00:00:28,062 --> 00:00:29,575
There's no doubt.

9
00:00:32,132 --> 00:00:33,665
Five is back.

10
00:02:13,121 --> 00:02:15,030
You've never behaved like this before.

11
00:02:15,055 --> 00:02:17,143
You seem excited. It's weird.

12
00:02:18,245 --> 00:02:20,168
Excuse me for having fun.

13
00:02:20,647 --> 00:02:23,587
I've been so bored playing this game by myself.

14
00:02:23,647 --> 00:02:25,694
I don't even care about winning anymore.

15
00:02:26,051 --> 00:02:29,101
I just want an opponent worthy of my attention.

16
00:02:29,729 --> 00:02:30,885
And now...

17
00:02:31,299 --> 00:02:33,502
...the prodigal son has returned.

18
00:02:33,527 --> 00:02:35,115
Let the games begin,

19
00:02:35,521 --> 00:02:36,588
Nine.

20
00:02:54,675 --> 00:02:55,629
Whoa.

21
00:02:59,302 --> 00:03:01,937
Our initial subway bombing report is complete.

22
00:03:02,298 --> 00:03:06,235
Although there were no fatalities.
72 people in total were injured.

23
00:03:06,266 --> 00:03:08,599
More than any of the prior Sphinx attacks.

24
00:03:09,419 --> 00:03:13,573
My men are currently analyzing surveillance
footage from the Shuto Shinjuku Line,

25
00:03:13,598 --> 00:03:15,682
as well as bomb fragments we recovered.

26
00:03:16,243 --> 00:03:20,646
We also have people looking into the connection
between the bombings and the recent interruption

27
00:03:20,671 --> 00:03:23,177
in cell phone service across all networks.

28
00:03:23,318 --> 00:03:25,110
That should just about do it, people.

29
00:03:25,155 --> 00:03:27,785
But before you leave. Let me say one thing.

30
00:03:28,581 --> 00:03:29,880
Go ahead, Chief.

31
00:03:30,653 --> 00:03:34,978
The United States Government made an offer
to provide assistance with our investigation.

32
00:03:35,165 --> 00:03:40,045
From this point on, we will coordinate our
efforts with the FBI's Counterterrorism Division,

33
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:41,987
to bring an end to these attacks.

34
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:49,052
We'll work with them, and put their experience to
good use. Any requests they make should be prioritized.

35
00:03:49,367 --> 00:03:50,334
Dismissed.

36
00:04:24,038 --> 00:04:26,510
Nine? Are you okay?

37
00:04:26,881 --> 00:04:28,305
Why don't you get some rest?

38
00:04:30,465 --> 00:04:32,879
I can't. Five's not gonna wait for that.

39
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:37,205
So what?

40
00:04:37,258 --> 00:04:39,622
Is she holding some kind of grudge against us?

41
00:04:39,729 --> 00:04:41,182
I don't understand.

42
00:04:41,719 --> 00:04:42,817
Neither do I.

43
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,415
If she had wanted to escape with us, she could've.

44
00:04:45,565 --> 00:04:47,636
I think she just likes playing the game.

45
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:50,033
Now she wants to pick up where she left off.

46
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:52,737
She's quite the adversary.

47
00:04:53,027 --> 00:04:55,937
Somethin' tells me she's not gonna go easy on us.

48
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:57,999
Um...

49
00:04:58,165 --> 00:05:01,536
I don't mean to eavesdrop, but maybe I could help out?

50
00:05:01,861 --> 00:05:03,006
What the hell could you do?

51
00:05:03,031 --> 00:05:05,969
U-Uh, I am capable of things, y'know!

52
00:05:05,994 --> 00:05:06,761
Like what?

53
00:05:06,854 --> 00:05:08,428
I could, uh...

54
00:05:08,645 --> 00:05:10,975
Blow up buildings? Hurt bystanders?

55
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,667
I don't know.

56
00:05:12,895 --> 00:05:14,337
Could you do that?

57
00:05:16,002 --> 00:05:18,331
No. I couldn't.

58
00:05:23,446 --> 00:05:26,628
'Cause this is what we're doing. Look at them.

59
00:05:28,193 --> 00:05:30,677
But Nine, we didn't detonate the bomb in the subway...

60
00:05:30,702 --> 00:05:32,507
So just stay out of our way, alright?

61
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:34,991
You wanna help? Do that.

62
00:05:43,902 --> 00:05:46,092
Their offer of support is just a front.

63
00:05:46,405 --> 00:05:49,066
The Americans are planning to take control, aren't they?

64
00:05:49,726 --> 00:05:53,754
If that happens, we're gonna have a
real hard time getting a single thing done.

65
00:05:54,168 --> 00:05:55,460
I'm afraid you're right.

66
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:57,969
From here on out, my hands are effectively tied.

67
00:05:59,842 --> 00:06:03,029
This have anything to do with you
getting called out of yesterday's meeting?

68
00:06:04,027 --> 00:06:05,329
Where'd you run off to?

69
00:06:07,777 --> 00:06:09,735
The Chief Cabinet Secretary's office.

70
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:12,217
Something seemed off the minute I walked in.

71
00:06:12,818 --> 00:06:16,542
All the Department heads were
sitting there waiting like whipped pups.

72
00:06:16,732 --> 00:06:18,871
That's where I met our new "partners."

73
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:23,189
Kurahashi. Let me introduce you.

74
00:06:23,243 --> 00:06:26,735
This is Special Agent Clarence, from the FBI.

75
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,135
It's a pleasure, sir.

76
00:06:28,219 --> 00:06:30,296
I'm First Division Chief Kurahashi.

77
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:35,659
They've kindly offered help getting
a handle on this Sphinx situation.

78
00:06:36,101 --> 00:06:38,096
The FBI? You're sure?

79
00:06:38,385 --> 00:06:39,635
Absolutely.

80
00:06:39,776 --> 00:06:42,197
The cabinet has already approved our decision.

81
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:45,527
One thing. This is a domestic incident.

82
00:06:45,552 --> 00:06:46,969
Why bring in the FBI?

83
00:06:47,175 --> 00:06:51,444
Surely their capable personnel have better
things to do than worry about bombs in Japan.

84
00:06:51,482 --> 00:06:52,999
There's a bit more to it.

85
00:07:01,187 --> 00:07:07,807
Six months ago, a nuclear fuel processing
facility in Aomori was infiltrated by persons unknown.

86
00:07:08,294 --> 00:07:12,879
The United States Government is "extremely
interested" in the item that went missing.

87
00:07:14,153 --> 00:07:19,555
We're here now 'cause we've reason to suspect
the ones behind the attack at the Aomori facility

88
00:07:19,664 --> 00:07:21,956
are the same as your serial bombers.

89
00:07:22,052 --> 00:07:24,887
More than just "reason to suspect."

90
00:07:25,502 --> 00:07:27,043
We have proof.

91
00:07:28,177 --> 00:07:30,569
What kind of proof are you talking about?

92
00:07:31,306 --> 00:07:34,770
If you don't mind sharing that
information, we can arrest...

93
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:43,154
On top of allowing those silly boys to
wreak havoc across your beautiful city.

94
00:07:43,572 --> 00:07:46,762
You let them leak sensitive
intel about the case to the public,

95
00:07:46,787 --> 00:07:50,408
and now you have the gall to puff
your chest and talk about making arrests?

96
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:53,095
That's the funniest joke I've heard all year.

97
00:08:32,136 --> 00:08:37,069
From what I gathered, the woman is a researcher
with the American Nuclear Emergency Support Team.

98
00:08:37,112 --> 00:08:38,258
NEST for short.

99
00:08:39,377 --> 00:08:42,048
A researcher? That doesn't seem right.

100
00:08:42,185 --> 00:08:44,126
I confirmed her official job title.

101
00:08:46,322 --> 00:08:47,344
I'll be damned.

102
00:08:47,708 --> 00:08:51,901
Apparently the FBI believes Sphinx
stole that Aomori plutonium as well.

103
00:08:52,135 --> 00:08:52,898
Yeah.

104
00:08:53,751 --> 00:08:58,064
Seems to make 'em think they've got the
authority to mess with those kids however they want.

105
00:08:58,637 --> 00:09:00,880
Like that crap that went down yesterday.

106
00:09:02,989 --> 00:09:05,941
What happens when they back the perps into a corner?

107
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:09,323
They gonna force that joker into play?

108
00:09:21,363 --> 00:09:23,551
Your voice is like the color of straw.

109
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:26,164
A pale yellow.

110
00:09:26,189 --> 00:09:27,111
What?

111
00:09:28,094 --> 00:09:29,374
Oh, sorry.

112
00:09:29,518 --> 00:09:32,772
Y'see, I have this condition known as synesthesia.

113
00:09:32,824 --> 00:09:35,116
I experience sounds as colors.

114
00:09:35,512 --> 00:09:36,367
Colors?

115
00:09:36,392 --> 00:09:37,677
Yeah. It's funny.

116
00:09:38,109 --> 00:09:40,319
There're lots of blues, greens and reds.

117
00:09:40,344 --> 00:09:41,904
But I hardly ever hear yellow.

118
00:09:44,103 --> 00:09:44,776
Oh.

119
00:09:45,058 --> 00:09:47,242
We're talkin' rare. Unique.

120
00:09:50,656 --> 00:09:53,385
I'm in the way. I know I am.

121
00:09:55,959 --> 00:09:58,307
It would be better if I just left, wouldn't it?

122
00:09:59,862 --> 00:10:02,689
What? No way. Nine was just bein' grouchy.

123
00:10:02,828 --> 00:10:05,470
He may say mean things, but he doesn't hate you.

124
00:10:07,307 --> 00:10:09,162
But he said... Huh?

125
00:10:09,187 --> 00:10:12,191
That's just mild sadism.

126
00:10:15,134 --> 00:10:16,140
Makes sense.

127
00:10:16,193 --> 00:10:18,587
I guess you know him pretty well by now, huh?

128
00:10:18,650 --> 00:10:19,322
Hm?

129
00:10:21,969 --> 00:10:25,109
I'll admit. I'm a little bit jealous.

130
00:10:27,861 --> 00:10:31,589
Well we've been together for most of our lives.

131
00:10:32,325 --> 00:10:33,784
Just the two of us.

132
00:10:37,177 --> 00:10:39,444
We interrupt with live, breaking news.

133
00:10:39,527 --> 00:10:42,277
The serial bombers called Sphinx have resurfaced.

134
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:45,308
Once again antagonizing authorities through riddles.

135
00:10:45,397 --> 00:10:48,189
Nice! Looks like we've got an impostor.

136
00:10:48,491 --> 00:10:50,969
Guess that's one way to know we've hit the big time.

137
00:10:51,071 --> 00:10:52,925
She's made the first move.

138
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:56,911
Okay, "Gaius Julius Caesar gone to Arab."

139
00:10:56,969 --> 00:10:58,170
"Gone to Arab?"

140
00:10:58,195 --> 00:11:01,558
But he went to Egypt. I think
I know what this means, though.

141
00:11:02,113 --> 00:11:03,988
It's a simple Caesar cipher.

142
00:11:04,045 --> 00:11:07,265
So does that mean it needs to
be changed to Arabic numerals?

143
00:11:09,039 --> 00:11:13,682
The Caesar cipher is an ancient substitution
coding system that shifts each letter

144
00:11:13,707 --> 00:11:16,122
a fixed number of places down the alphabet.

145
00:11:17,201 --> 00:11:21,132
If there isn't an assigned shift, the
default is three letters to the left.

146
00:11:21,734 --> 00:11:24,793
Since there was no assigned shift sent with the message,

147
00:11:24,892 --> 00:11:27,226
we'll have to hope the default does the job.

148
00:11:34,663 --> 00:11:38,094
No dice. Maybe, coordinates?

149
00:11:38,177 --> 00:11:39,160
Could be.

150
00:11:46,811 --> 00:11:49,469
Haneda Airport, International Terminal.

151
00:11:49,552 --> 00:11:52,700
Yeah. It's one of our targets.

152
00:11:55,010 --> 00:11:57,527
All right! Get a hold of the airport right away!

153
00:11:57,605 --> 00:11:58,343
Yes sir!

154
00:11:58,950 --> 00:12:00,854
So what's with the twenty at the end?

155
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:04,110
The time the bomb's set to go off, most likely.

156
00:12:08,311 --> 00:12:09,728
"VON voyage"?

157
00:12:09,892 --> 00:12:12,942
As in "Have a nice trip"? They're just messin' with us!

158
00:12:13,135 --> 00:12:14,974
Also, they've misspelled it.

159
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,291
No. It's intentional.

160
00:12:19,798 --> 00:12:23,653
"VON voyage?" They're really
trying to make this look like us.

161
00:12:27,732 --> 00:12:30,344
This is it. Her message to us.

162
00:12:30,946 --> 00:12:33,668
Her way of saying that she's seen through everything.

163
00:12:50,101 --> 00:12:51,154
Yes.

164
00:12:51,179 --> 00:12:54,486
I have already been briefed on the situation by the MLIT.

165
00:12:54,511 --> 00:12:56,639
Thing is, this is very hush-hush.

166
00:12:56,664 --> 00:13:00,104
Every single operative involved
has top-tier security clearance.

167
00:13:00,129 --> 00:13:02,056
What we need from you is discretion.

168
00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:05,896
Therefore, any communication with
the terrorists should be through us.

169
00:13:05,921 --> 00:13:07,932
An' we'll pass the info onto the police.

170
00:13:08,297 --> 00:13:11,549
I understand. I'll make the necessary arrangements.

171
00:13:19,524 --> 00:13:21,836
Do you really think those two are gonna bite?

172
00:13:22,364 --> 00:13:24,948
They gotta be smart enough to realize this is a trap.

173
00:13:25,165 --> 00:13:26,208
They will come.

174
00:13:27,328 --> 00:13:29,319
They will come to see me.

175
00:13:31,469 --> 00:13:33,553
Isn't it possible the bomb's a fake?

176
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:37,332
If it's Five, and she never does anything half-assed,

177
00:13:37,452 --> 00:13:42,986
she'll blow it up for real. Because she has nothing
to lose. She knows the cops will blame it on us.

178
00:13:43,344 --> 00:13:45,358
Let's put out a video saying it wasn't us!

179
00:13:45,383 --> 00:13:48,469
The word of a mysterious fringe group, or Metro PD.

180
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:50,543
Which one would you buy into?

181
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:51,956
So messed up.

182
00:13:52,094 --> 00:13:55,633
Try to stop the bomb and get caught. Or option two:

183
00:13:55,686 --> 00:13:58,737
we ignore it, and are implicated as murderous psychopaths.

184
00:13:59,443 --> 00:14:01,167
'At's one hell of a trap!

185
00:14:01,735 --> 00:14:04,969
It's summer vacation, so the airport's gonna be packed.

186
00:14:05,197 --> 00:14:08,061
Depending on how strong the bomb is and where it's placed.

187
00:14:08,751 --> 00:14:10,858
Hundreds of those people could die!

188
00:14:11,454 --> 00:14:12,975
She's gone insane.

189
00:14:13,344 --> 00:14:16,256
You know there was never any sanity to begin with.

190
00:14:17,010 --> 00:14:20,503
Not for her, and not for us.

191
00:14:21,802 --> 00:14:22,960
Detective! Over here!

192
00:14:22,985 --> 00:14:24,035
Sir! On my way!

193
00:14:26,594 --> 00:14:27,841
What's buggin' you?

194
00:14:28,194 --> 00:14:30,424
I don't think this is really from Sphinx.

195
00:14:30,449 --> 00:14:32,238
Yeah? Why do ya say that?

196
00:14:32,569 --> 00:14:34,368
The clue's too cut and dry. Doesn't feel like

197
00:14:34,469 --> 00:14:37,112
there's a message hiding below the surface.

198
00:14:37,224 --> 00:14:39,944
Look, we don't have time to
think about that stuff right now.

199
00:14:39,969 --> 00:14:42,613
We only have four hours to find and disarm the bomb.

200
00:14:42,861 --> 00:14:44,727
Let's go earn our salaries, old man!

201
00:14:44,935 --> 00:14:47,844
Attention! Everybody listen up.

202
00:14:49,568 --> 00:14:51,410
We have orders straight from the top.

203
00:14:51,803 --> 00:14:55,429
The Explosives Ordinance Disposal
team is en route to remove the bomb.

204
00:14:55,630 --> 00:14:59,159
We're supposed to stay here
and await further instructions.

205
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:02,034
But, wait a sec! Director!

206
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:04,524
This was a challenge issued to Metro PD!

207
00:15:04,549 --> 00:15:05,445
Please let us go!

208
00:15:05,470 --> 00:15:06,427
C'mon, sir!

209
00:15:06,452 --> 00:15:07,597
We want some payback!

210
00:15:07,622 --> 00:15:09,288
Yeah! Why do we have to stay put?

211
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,400
What the hell is this?

212
00:15:10,425 --> 00:15:11,993
Everyone, calm down!

213
00:15:12,438 --> 00:15:15,290
Director. You said these orders came from the top?

214
00:15:15,553 --> 00:15:18,026
From the Superintendent General's mouth.

215
00:15:18,762 --> 00:15:22,427
I shouldn't have to say this, but
renegade cops will not be tolerated.

216
00:15:22,555 --> 00:15:24,036
No one get cute.

217
00:15:30,496 --> 00:15:33,584
Uh, yo, Shibazaki. Where're you going?

218
00:15:33,781 --> 00:15:35,044
To grab some food.

219
00:15:35,484 --> 00:15:38,100
I have a feeling we'll all be stuck here for a while.

220
00:15:40,652 --> 00:15:42,086
This is gonna suck.

221
00:15:42,293 --> 00:15:44,735
The international terminal is freakin' huge!

222
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:45,516
Yeah.

223
00:15:46,073 --> 00:15:47,948
So, how are we supposed to find the bomb?

224
00:15:47,973 --> 00:15:49,362
Well most likely,

225
00:15:49,387 --> 00:15:51,877
we'll receive the next riddle once we get there.

226
00:15:52,718 --> 00:15:56,735
I counted about 1500 surveillance
cameras spread throughout the terminal.

227
00:15:56,810 --> 00:15:59,787
And naturally, Five'll be
monitoring every single one of 'em.

228
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:04,302
Which means we need to act under
the assumption we'll be apprehended.

229
00:16:04,368 --> 00:16:06,969
No way. We just need someone new.

230
00:16:07,078 --> 00:16:09,555
Someone whose face hasn't been tied to us yet.

231
00:16:12,946 --> 00:16:18,722
No! Sorry. I thought I'd make noodles. You hungry?

232
00:16:19,987 --> 00:16:21,324
No way in hell.

233
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:24,756
To what? The noodles?

234
00:16:30,043 --> 00:16:31,577
Where do you think you're going?

235
00:16:32,185 --> 00:16:35,821
It's against the rules to use official
vehicles for personal food breaks.

236
00:16:36,321 --> 00:16:40,024
Or were you planning to get yourself into trouble again?

237
00:16:40,921 --> 00:16:42,713
Times have changed, gramps.

238
00:16:43,204 --> 00:16:45,094
The lone wolf shtick's kinda done.

239
00:16:46,954 --> 00:16:49,037
That goes for you too, Hamura.

240
00:16:50,024 --> 00:16:52,652
Sorry, boys. 'Bout those "dinner" plans?

241
00:16:52,677 --> 00:16:53,818
We'll be joinin' ya.

242
00:16:58,352 --> 00:16:59,265
Impossible.

243
00:16:59,385 --> 00:17:03,849
Think about it. Wouldn't someone amateurish
be useful in a situation like this one?

244
00:17:04,199 --> 00:17:05,437
Amateurish?

245
00:17:05,462 --> 00:17:06,141
Let's go.

246
00:17:06,166 --> 00:17:10,444
Wait. Kokonoe. Uh. Nine!

247
00:17:14,511 --> 00:17:18,022
It's just that. I want to be one of you.

248
00:17:18,405 --> 00:17:20,065
Let me help your cause!

249
00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:23,660
And maybe I can't handle the bombs.

250
00:17:23,794 --> 00:17:26,427
Or any of this other stuff yet, but please!

251
00:17:26,452 --> 00:17:27,766
I'll study hard!

252
00:17:36,151 --> 00:17:37,470
We'll move separately.

253
00:17:38,412 --> 00:17:40,469
To avoid the security cameras.

254
00:17:40,644 --> 00:17:42,617
Take the train out to the airport.

255
00:17:50,023 --> 00:17:51,357
Ah, the irony.

256
00:17:51,427 --> 00:17:55,822
Here we are, a couple terrorists,
heading out to try and prevent a bombing.

257
00:18:29,062 --> 00:18:30,756
Everything's in place.

258
00:18:54,679 --> 00:18:56,804
Pull up the "Runpass" activity log.

259
00:18:57,104 --> 00:18:57,912
Yes, ma'am.

260
00:18:58,063 --> 00:19:01,769
Filter down to users active in the last 15 minutes.

261
00:19:01,794 --> 00:19:02,568
Yes, ma'am.

262
00:19:02,838 --> 00:19:05,151
Check with all airport personnel lists.

263
00:19:05,442 --> 00:19:06,906
Sure, one moment.

264
00:19:07,094 --> 00:19:07,837
Move!

265
00:19:08,543 --> 00:19:09,785
My apologies.

266
00:19:16,353 --> 00:19:19,833
You're getting careless. Nine.

267
00:19:21,427 --> 00:19:24,485
Show the camera C15 feed from ten minutes ago.

268
00:19:24,616 --> 00:19:27,009
It'll take about three minutes to transfer the data.

269
00:19:27,235 --> 00:19:28,402
You're kidding me.

270
00:19:28,486 --> 00:19:31,776
Bring up F12 to G6 on the main monitors.

271
00:19:32,441 --> 00:19:33,175
Done.

272
00:19:54,867 --> 00:19:56,226
S'about time, isn't it?

273
00:19:56,437 --> 00:19:58,278
Yeah, let's move out.

274
00:20:04,239 --> 00:20:05,677
Target confirmed.

275
00:20:19,293 --> 00:20:20,502
A chessboard?

276
00:20:20,572 --> 00:20:21,810
That's crazy.

277
00:20:21,835 --> 00:20:24,153
You think she wants to continue the game from before?

278
00:20:24,178 --> 00:20:27,730
Uh-huh. She's planning to use the airport as the board

279
00:20:27,916 --> 00:20:29,737
and us as the pieces.

280
00:20:35,152 --> 00:20:36,293
And lemme guess.

281
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:40,182
If we win, the position of the last
piece will match the bomb's location.

282
00:20:40,390 --> 00:20:41,322
Yeah.

283
00:20:55,527 --> 00:20:57,318
King's Knight to F6!

284
00:20:57,343 --> 00:20:58,049
Good luck!

285
00:21:10,389 --> 00:21:13,535
It's been far too long since we last played.

286
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:14,715
Run, Nine.
