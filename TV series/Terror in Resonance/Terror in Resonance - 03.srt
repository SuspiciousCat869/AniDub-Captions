1
00:00:02,925 --> 00:00:05,181
It's true you may be an accomplice.

2
00:00:05,377 --> 00:00:06,767
You're not one of us, though.

3
00:00:07,846 --> 00:00:11,898
Nothing personal. But one false
move, and I'll have to kill ya.

4
00:00:17,296 --> 00:00:21,839
I think these guys have every intention
of picking a fight with this entire country.

5
00:00:22,432 --> 00:00:24,762
We need you back. I'm sorry.

6
00:00:28,281 --> 00:00:31,361
Come on out. I'm waiting for you.

7
00:02:05,663 --> 00:02:07,246
I can't believe this!

8
00:02:07,349 --> 00:02:11,815
No! Some random, crusty old dude from
Archives comin' up to be my boss? It's a joke.

9
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,060
What. You haven't heard of him before?

10
00:02:14,111 --> 00:02:15,150
He's not random.

11
00:02:15,194 --> 00:02:17,353
Shibazaki used to be one of our best guys.

12
00:02:17,378 --> 00:02:17,838
Huh?

13
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:19,898
It's the truth. He was incredible.

14
00:02:19,923 --> 00:02:21,932
Everyone called him "Razor Shibazaki".

15
00:02:22,065 --> 00:02:25,749
Wish I had a nickname like that.
Wish I had a nickname, period.

16
00:02:25,798 --> 00:02:28,215
An' how long's it been since he was a detective?

17
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:32,658
This guy was basically sent down to
Archives to rot until retirement. And now he...

18
00:02:34,434 --> 00:02:35,475
Morning.

19
00:02:35,862 --> 00:02:37,348
Hey, welcome back.

20
00:02:37,684 --> 00:02:38,965
Come on, Shibazaki.

21
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:42,007
You realize I'm not helping
you move all this crap for free.

22
00:02:42,149 --> 00:02:43,791
Anyone know where my desk is?

23
00:02:43,816 --> 00:02:46,327
Yeah, it's right over here. Scram.

24
00:02:46,966 --> 00:02:49,799
Man, you should treat me to lunch or something for this.

25
00:02:49,903 --> 00:02:51,106
You like ramen, right?

26
00:02:51,551 --> 00:02:53,009
Stop doing that!

27
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:57,185
I mean, yeah, I do, but quit assuming
all fat people worship at the carb altar!

28
00:02:58,283 --> 00:02:59,458
Hey, Hamura!

29
00:03:07,694 --> 00:03:09,819
It's tough. I don't know, Nine.

30
00:03:09,929 --> 00:03:11,838
What if the riddle is too hard for them?

31
00:03:11,906 --> 00:03:13,371
It's fine, Don't worry.

32
00:03:13,518 --> 00:03:14,858
Yeah, so you say.

33
00:03:15,254 --> 00:03:18,451
I'm just not sure what we're gonna
do if no one can solve it again.

34
00:03:18,576 --> 00:03:22,152
The other day, when they were
investigating the Roppongi bomb.

35
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:27,069
I saw vans from the Nuclear, Biological,
and Chemical Terrorism Special Forces.

36
00:03:27,382 --> 00:03:28,622
Makes me think.

37
00:03:28,949 --> 00:03:32,243
It's possible they've got someone
who's figured out what we're up to.

38
00:03:33,917 --> 00:03:35,997
This ought to help us know for sure.

39
00:03:46,715 --> 00:03:48,132
As you can see,

40
00:03:48,215 --> 00:03:50,798
the culprit entered the police station like this.

41
00:03:51,052 --> 00:03:52,898
Ignoring surveillance cameras,

42
00:03:53,105 --> 00:03:58,923
he calmly planted a delivery box containing the
plastic bomb, turned around, and left. In my opinion,

43
00:03:59,007 --> 00:04:01,590
we should consider this act our confirmation.

44
00:04:01,615 --> 00:04:04,360
They are directly challenging the police force.

45
00:04:05,598 --> 00:04:07,298
Understanding this threat,

46
00:04:07,323 --> 00:04:11,378
we have no choice but to assume they're
likely working on their next bomb as we speak.

47
00:04:16,269 --> 00:04:20,977
So, I've got more on the stolen plutonium...
from the nuclear facility in Aomori?

48
00:04:21,316 --> 00:04:23,558
One of the fugitives was an employee.

49
00:04:23,731 --> 00:04:26,291
But he had only been working there for a few months.

50
00:04:26,876 --> 00:04:29,135
In the files he's Yuzu Miyajima.

51
00:04:29,935 --> 00:04:32,949
Apparently, though, that person has never existed.

52
00:04:33,793 --> 00:04:34,960
How's that happen?

53
00:04:35,056 --> 00:04:36,035
Best guess?

54
00:04:36,216 --> 00:04:39,762
He used the Basic Residents'
Registration Network to get hired on.

55
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:43,417
He infiltrated the government
office and fabricated a new identity.

56
00:04:43,858 --> 00:04:49,553
An identity with local ties, since the facility tends
to hire from within their community whenever possible.

57
00:04:50,066 --> 00:04:50,766
And?

58
00:04:51,372 --> 00:04:54,629
Look at his face. There's a sketch of him in that file.

59
00:04:56,311 --> 00:04:58,228
They didn't bother takin' a photo?

60
00:04:58,465 --> 00:05:01,358
No, they did. But it was mysteriously deleted somehow.

61
00:05:01,518 --> 00:05:04,071
At the time, we sent out an emergency deployment.

62
00:05:04,577 --> 00:05:07,871
But Miyajima and his accomplice have seemingly vanished.

63
00:05:07,896 --> 00:05:11,673
No trail, no trace, no evidence they even existed.

64
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:14,222
Looks like he's only a kid.

65
00:05:14,513 --> 00:05:15,508
Yeah.

66
00:05:19,578 --> 00:05:22,672
I've told you about what it was
like where I grew up, haven't I?

67
00:05:23,022 --> 00:05:25,265
About being surrounded by old people.

68
00:05:25,784 --> 00:05:28,241
Oh yeah. You're from Hiroshima.

69
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:31,210
I'll never forget those summers.

70
00:05:32,036 --> 00:05:33,336
Man, I hated them.

71
00:05:40,725 --> 00:05:42,632
Once it started to get warm,

72
00:05:42,681 --> 00:05:44,446
the city became a ghost town.

73
00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:49,824
The elderly stayed in, almost never leaving their houses.

74
00:05:52,284 --> 00:05:54,905
They'd say they didn't feel well because of the heat.

75
00:05:56,419 --> 00:05:58,524
I spent a lot of time with my grandmother.

76
00:06:00,906 --> 00:06:05,411
I always felt as though the summer would
steal her from me. She'd turn into someone else.

77
00:06:05,436 --> 00:06:08,983
Yeah. I hated summer. I resented it.

78
00:06:10,665 --> 00:06:14,322
That's why you took this case.
Second-generation victim of The Bomb?

79
00:06:14,956 --> 00:06:18,222
Must be hard to watch a couple of
kids playing around with nuclear weapons.

80
00:06:18,798 --> 00:06:21,359
Yeah. They bother me.

81
00:06:22,501 --> 00:06:26,584
Somethin' about this, though.
I dunno. Just doesn't add up.

82
00:07:06,034 --> 00:07:07,150
Mister Kawai.

83
00:07:07,645 --> 00:07:09,317
You've been doing this a while, right?

84
00:07:09,523 --> 00:07:12,220
How could you make such a simple
mistake while working the crane?

85
00:07:12,815 --> 00:07:16,361
I told you. I was tired from tons of overtime, okay?

86
00:07:16,581 --> 00:07:19,507
I've said it for years, man. That company's a sweatshop.

87
00:07:19,629 --> 00:07:22,004
So uh, why don't you investigate that?

88
00:07:22,048 --> 00:07:23,193
You listen!

89
00:07:25,173 --> 00:07:26,149
Shibazaki.

90
00:07:26,174 --> 00:07:28,433
S'cuse me. Mind if I have a chair?

91
00:07:29,353 --> 00:07:30,555
I have a bad back.

92
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:31,376
Oh, sure.

93
00:07:33,259 --> 00:07:36,217
So, Mister Kawai. You're a big fan of gambling.

94
00:07:36,315 --> 00:07:38,481
Yeah? What's your point?

95
00:07:38,618 --> 00:07:40,982
Horses or fights? I'm guessing fights.

96
00:07:41,007 --> 00:07:41,454
Huh?

97
00:07:43,007 --> 00:07:44,840
What kinda bet did you lose, guy?

98
00:07:44,922 --> 00:07:47,175
I hear someone's hired gun's been payin' you visits.

99
00:07:48,133 --> 00:07:50,065
No, uh, not recently.

100
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:50,815
Why's that?

101
00:07:51,142 --> 00:07:54,277
Why would a man whose job is to
get money from you stop showing up?

102
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:55,367
Uh...

103
00:07:58,411 --> 00:07:59,415
What's this?

104
00:08:00,099 --> 00:08:02,987
Maybe it's the debt collector
in question comin' to answer that.

105
00:08:05,296 --> 00:08:06,932
I got something, Shibazaki.

106
00:08:08,882 --> 00:08:12,213
All the proof we needed was just
sittin' there on your computer.

107
00:08:13,048 --> 00:08:16,285
Surprising, since you handed it over to us voluntarily.

108
00:08:20,502 --> 00:08:22,337
Kawai confessed to everything.

109
00:08:22,824 --> 00:08:26,785
He got an email saying if he cut the
power line and made it look like an accident,

110
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:28,991
he'd receive two million yen for the effort.

111
00:08:29,026 --> 00:08:30,098
And the money?

112
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:32,527
Did they ever actually deliver any of it to him?

113
00:08:32,648 --> 00:08:33,314
Yes.

114
00:08:33,436 --> 00:08:35,820
Apparently, Kawai replied saying he could do it.

115
00:08:35,875 --> 00:08:39,952
And even though he never told anyone his account
number, he had one million transferred to him.

116
00:08:40,033 --> 00:08:42,773
Have we looked into the sending
account and time of transfer?

117
00:08:42,817 --> 00:08:44,026
Nothing there, either.

118
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:46,228
The transfer came from a dummy account.

119
00:08:46,308 --> 00:08:47,883
There's a bigger issue, though.

120
00:08:48,197 --> 00:08:51,322
These guys knew what would
happen if that power line was cut.

121
00:08:51,606 --> 00:08:54,779
They planned this "accident" so
there'd be a citywide blackout,

122
00:08:54,859 --> 00:08:56,933
cutting off power to the government building.

123
00:08:57,804 --> 00:09:01,403
But we're talking about well-prepared criminals here.

124
00:09:01,428 --> 00:09:04,534
Why would they choose to leave
behind an email that could be traced?

125
00:09:05,066 --> 00:09:07,691
Not to mention the footage from Roppongi Station.

126
00:09:07,927 --> 00:09:11,342
It's as if they're intentionally
leaving behind evidence for us to find.

127
00:09:12,157 --> 00:09:12,877
Uh.

128
00:09:12,903 --> 00:09:13,857
What's the problem?

129
00:09:13,882 --> 00:09:16,165
We got another one! It's Sphinx!

130
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:19,690
Sorry to keep you waiting, fans!

131
00:09:19,715 --> 00:09:22,972
It's time for "Can you solve Sphinx's riddle?"

132
00:09:23,299 --> 00:09:24,787
I'm Sphinx Number One.

133
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:27,289
And I'm Sphinx Two.

134
00:09:27,353 --> 00:09:28,822
Now, for today's riddle.

135
00:09:29,127 --> 00:09:33,036
What is the building next to the
house of the god who solved the riddle?

136
00:09:34,142 --> 00:09:38,117
Remember, there will be another
"boom" if you don't solve it in time!

137
00:09:38,142 --> 00:09:40,648
You have until 10 AM tomorrow.

138
00:09:40,673 --> 00:09:41,985
Good luck, everyone!

139
00:09:42,086 --> 00:09:46,517
Keep walkin' until you have to drag your foot
behind you like a good, old-fashioned cripple!

140
00:09:48,696 --> 00:09:49,262
Right.

141
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:52,673
Can you replay the video?

142
00:09:52,965 --> 00:09:53,455
Sure.

143
00:09:55,815 --> 00:09:56,570
That's good.

144
00:09:57,193 --> 00:09:58,413
10 AM tomorrow.

145
00:09:59,047 --> 00:09:59,628
Good luck...

146
00:09:59,653 --> 00:10:02,459
Sphinx Two is clapping his hands like he's praying.

147
00:10:02,706 --> 00:10:05,815
I'd say "house of the god" has
to refer to a shrine somewhere.

148
00:10:05,866 --> 00:10:08,440
Okay, then what god are they talking about?

149
00:10:08,523 --> 00:10:10,695
Which one solved the Sphinx's riddle correctly?

150
00:10:11,088 --> 00:10:12,308
That was Oedipus!

151
00:10:12,371 --> 00:10:17,201
Oedipus is from Greek myth. You think maybe
he's got some kind of analog in Japanese tradition?

152
00:10:17,349 --> 00:10:19,882
Yeah. I like how you're thinkin'.

153
00:10:21,423 --> 00:10:24,672
What do you think that "drag your
foot behind you" comment was about?

154
00:10:24,993 --> 00:10:27,826
Best guess, it has to do with the name Oedipus.

155
00:10:27,981 --> 00:10:29,746
It means "swollen foot".

156
00:10:29,798 --> 00:10:30,986
Why name him that?

157
00:10:31,632 --> 00:10:34,602
Because after abandoning Oedipus in the forest,

158
00:10:34,679 --> 00:10:36,846
Laius didn't want him to run away,

159
00:10:36,871 --> 00:10:39,425
so dear ol' dad put a nail through his son's heel.

160
00:10:39,548 --> 00:10:40,752
Well, that's brutal.

161
00:10:41,274 --> 00:10:45,174
He wound up being saved by a shepherd
and then adopted by the king of Corinth.

162
00:10:45,257 --> 00:10:47,410
When the king saw the child's injured leg,

163
00:10:47,484 --> 00:10:50,060
he named him "swollen foot", or Oedipus.

164
00:10:50,875 --> 00:10:51,704
How literal.

165
00:10:52,402 --> 00:10:54,041
According to one theory.

166
00:10:54,085 --> 00:10:57,098
Oedipus remained disabled to some extent his whole life.

167
00:10:57,149 --> 00:10:57,845
"Crippled".

168
00:10:58,565 --> 00:10:59,815
We need to move fast.

169
00:11:00,108 --> 00:11:03,396
They gave us an exact time of
day, which they haven't done before.

170
00:11:03,431 --> 00:11:06,413
Check out all the shrines in the
city 'til we get somewhere with this.

171
00:11:06,576 --> 00:11:07,240
Yes, sir!

172
00:11:13,761 --> 00:11:19,700
Lisa, please! Lisa! Lisa! Lisa! Lisa!

173
00:12:03,191 --> 00:12:07,422
Shibazaki. I wanted to lie down
there and play. Will you move?

174
00:12:07,465 --> 00:12:11,516
No dice. I need it more. I do
my best thinking on this couch.

175
00:12:11,541 --> 00:12:12,396
Come on!

176
00:12:12,739 --> 00:12:14,753
You just wanna play a video game.

177
00:12:14,882 --> 00:12:16,116
Why don't you go home for that?

178
00:12:16,141 --> 00:12:17,940
Because I'm keeping you company, bro.

179
00:12:17,965 --> 00:12:19,550
I don't want you to get lonely here.

180
00:12:19,798 --> 00:12:21,220
You're welcome, by the way.

181
00:12:21,298 --> 00:12:22,732
Yeah, thanks a bunch.

182
00:12:22,757 --> 00:12:25,458
Hey. That's prob'ly Sphinx's problem, you know?

183
00:12:26,056 --> 00:12:28,135
They're just lonely and want some attention.

184
00:12:28,413 --> 00:12:29,702
Couple of brats.

185
00:12:30,452 --> 00:12:33,327
Blowing things up 'cause they're desperate for attention?

186
00:12:33,352 --> 00:12:34,826
I can't accept that.

187
00:12:36,132 --> 00:12:38,130
No! Aw, man.

188
00:12:40,090 --> 00:12:41,687
Is that an online game?

189
00:12:42,308 --> 00:12:46,965
Yeah, you work with other players to
defeat monsters. It's pretty addictive.

190
00:12:47,028 --> 00:12:47,850
Really?

191
00:12:49,263 --> 00:12:53,312
I usually assume kids these days play
this stuff to avoid dealing with people,

192
00:12:53,732 --> 00:12:56,567
but it looks like making
connections might still be a thing.

193
00:12:56,635 --> 00:13:00,543
That's not good. You just made
a "kids these days" comment.

194
00:13:00,568 --> 00:13:02,089
Proof you're officially old.

195
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:06,690
I did it! Look! I finally beat the green dragon!

196
00:13:06,715 --> 00:13:09,090
I swear, I've been stuck on this jerk for days!

197
00:13:09,304 --> 00:13:10,559
A dragon.

198
00:13:12,098 --> 00:13:15,890
That's right. He was an ancestor of Oedipus's mother.

199
00:13:17,322 --> 00:13:19,662
Of course! Mukasa, you're a genius!

200
00:13:19,687 --> 00:13:20,175
Huh?

201
00:14:02,347 --> 00:14:03,051
Who's there?

202
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:06,632
Lisa? Lisa, is that you?

203
00:14:17,009 --> 00:14:19,426
Yeah, I dunno. You think that'll work?

204
00:14:19,523 --> 00:14:20,335
Yes.

205
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:25,996
I don't understand. Are you trying to provoke them?

206
00:14:26,465 --> 00:14:28,755
Not at all, but I'll take the heat if I do.

207
00:14:30,139 --> 00:14:31,339
If that's what you want.

208
00:14:31,441 --> 00:14:33,898
What are you talking about? You won't take the heat!

209
00:14:33,923 --> 00:14:37,162
If something goes wrong, the
Director's up the creek, not you!

210
00:14:38,022 --> 00:14:42,567
Well, in that case, I apologize
ahead of time if that happens.

211
00:14:42,632 --> 00:14:43,340
Huh?

212
00:15:09,701 --> 00:15:11,742
A name is a gift of love.

213
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,670
But you have been abandoned.

214
00:15:13,793 --> 00:15:16,376
Love does not exist in your world.

215
00:15:16,459 --> 00:15:18,652
Your old names are signs of pretense;

216
00:15:18,735 --> 00:15:22,516
which is unacceptable. Pretense must be eliminated.

217
00:15:23,554 --> 00:15:27,141
Therefore, you will be given new, practical designations.

218
00:15:47,892 --> 00:15:51,377
You okay? Are your ears ringing again?

219
00:15:51,983 --> 00:15:55,269
No. My ears are fine.

220
00:15:56,356 --> 00:15:58,493
We swore not to lie. Don't forget.

221
00:15:59,059 --> 00:16:02,059
I won't. But you're not supposed to lie, either.

222
00:16:02,156 --> 00:16:03,447
You met up with Lisa.

223
00:16:04,893 --> 00:16:06,122
That obvious?

224
00:16:06,773 --> 00:16:09,727
Don't worry, I won't get too involved.

225
00:16:09,916 --> 00:16:11,480
Because, I know if I do,

226
00:16:12,294 --> 00:16:14,404
it'll be much more painful later.

227
00:16:22,277 --> 00:16:23,445
Okay, any time.

228
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:27,526
Hello. This is for Sphinx One and Two.

229
00:16:27,666 --> 00:16:29,023
I'm Detective Shibazaki.

230
00:16:29,933 --> 00:16:30,715
Nice!

231
00:16:31,605 --> 00:16:34,324
You'll be happy to know I have an answer for your riddle.

232
00:16:36,244 --> 00:16:40,571
You asked us "What's the building next to
the house of the god who solved the riddle?"

233
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:44,272
We know the one who solved
the Sphinx's riddle was Oedipus.

234
00:16:44,563 --> 00:16:50,348
He wasn't the child of a god, but the ancestor
of his mother and wife was a dragon in human form.

235
00:16:50,871 --> 00:16:53,246
One theory states that Oedipus was crippled,

236
00:16:53,383 --> 00:16:56,248
as you so eloquently put it, for his entire life.

237
00:16:57,651 --> 00:17:00,476
A dragon who drags his feet? Arahabaki.

238
00:17:00,669 --> 00:17:02,215
Oh, ho!

239
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:06,608
Arahabaki is a mysterious god
found in the Kanto and Tohoku regions.

240
00:17:07,007 --> 00:17:08,887
The god of fighting and iron-making.

241
00:17:09,148 --> 00:17:11,238
He's also known as "god of feet".

242
00:17:12,168 --> 00:17:15,887
At one point, he had to wander
different areas after losing his home.

243
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:19,285
He became so exhausted that he dragged his feet.

244
00:17:21,753 --> 00:17:24,277
Please, excuse me. We have breaking news.

245
00:17:24,302 --> 00:17:26,884
We're being told the Metropolitan Police Department

246
00:17:26,909 --> 00:17:29,604
is using the internet to answer the bombers' riddle.

247
00:17:32,098 --> 00:17:35,473
Also. The "habaki" part of "Arahabaki?"

248
00:17:35,547 --> 00:17:37,393
It's derived from "dragon tree".

249
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:39,621
Connecting it to the dragon god.

250
00:17:40,054 --> 00:17:43,695
The most famous Arahabaki shrine is in Miyaki Prefecture.

251
00:17:43,964 --> 00:17:47,527
However, he's still worshipped
within Tokyo proper, as well.

252
00:17:48,189 --> 00:17:49,184
Right here.

253
00:17:51,984 --> 00:17:53,996
Shirahige Shrine in Katsushika.

254
00:17:57,518 --> 00:17:59,468
This is the building next to it.

255
00:18:16,099 --> 00:18:18,173
We've just finished disarming the bomb, sir.

256
00:18:18,209 --> 00:18:19,642
Thanks. Good work.

257
00:18:26,336 --> 00:18:28,965
There you have it. The answer to your riddle.

258
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:30,990
Not bad.

259
00:18:37,184 --> 00:18:38,894
Yes, that's right.

260
00:18:38,959 --> 00:18:41,418
We've just been told the bomb has been disarmed.

261
00:18:46,716 --> 00:18:48,476
Well that's what you wanted to hear, right?

262
00:18:48,564 --> 00:18:49,876
How's it make you feel?

263
00:18:50,298 --> 00:18:52,808
I'm betting it doesn't make you feel anything at all.

264
00:18:53,054 --> 00:18:56,007
I don't know if this is a game to you or what.

265
00:18:56,431 --> 00:18:58,262
But don't get carried away.

266
00:18:59,530 --> 00:19:03,751
I hope you boys realize the joker
you're wavin' around is not a toy.

267
00:19:03,923 --> 00:19:05,742
...And if you play that card. ...Cut the feed.

268
00:19:05,916 --> 00:19:06,548
Right.

269
00:19:06,907 --> 00:19:09,372
I will take you both out myself!

270
00:19:14,365 --> 00:19:17,220
Shibazaki! What the hell was that?

271
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:19,649
Were you just antagonizing them on purpose?

272
00:19:19,876 --> 00:19:24,005
Don't worry. I've asked Director
Kurahashi to follow-up if necessary, right?

273
00:19:24,916 --> 00:19:26,549
Oh yeah, right.

274
00:19:27,395 --> 00:19:28,732
Did you notice?

275
00:19:28,757 --> 00:19:29,662
Yes, I did.

276
00:19:30,353 --> 00:19:34,322
Hazmat suits mixed in with
their bomb suits and other gear.

277
00:19:35,214 --> 00:19:36,933
Can only mean one thing.

278
00:19:37,447 --> 00:19:39,756
Yeah. The cops have connected it.

279
00:19:40,571 --> 00:19:44,157
They definitely know we were
the ones who stole the plutonium.

280
00:19:46,111 --> 00:19:50,173
A bomb was removed from the building
next to Shirahige Shrine in Katsushika.

281
00:19:50,316 --> 00:19:55,143
The Metropolitan Police Department solved
the bombers' riddle from a video streaming site,

282
00:19:55,168 --> 00:19:56,598
and the bomb was found succes...

283
00:19:56,690 --> 00:19:59,606
Um, excuse me, Director Kurahashi?

284
00:19:59,749 --> 00:20:01,947
Hm? What is it?

285
00:20:02,203 --> 00:20:03,578
It's about Shibazaki.

286
00:20:03,715 --> 00:20:06,685
What is his deal? I heard he used to be an ace.

287
00:20:06,729 --> 00:20:09,607
But then what? I'm just curious what happened.

288
00:20:11,781 --> 00:20:17,548
It goes back 15 years, when a Diet secretary from
the ruling party fell to his death from a hotel room.

289
00:20:17,632 --> 00:20:18,461
Okay?

290
00:20:23,943 --> 00:20:29,091
It was initially ruled to be an accident or a
suicide, but Shibazaki refused to accept that.

291
00:20:29,453 --> 00:20:32,423
He insisted on the possibility
that the dead man had been involved

292
00:20:32,448 --> 00:20:34,444
in some kind of conspiracy,

293
00:20:34,621 --> 00:20:39,423
and even went so far as to investigate
the leader of the victim's political faction.

294
00:20:39,448 --> 00:20:41,123
That couldn't have ended well.

295
00:20:42,272 --> 00:20:43,522
The faction leader?

296
00:20:43,759 --> 00:20:45,809
Originally from the Police Department.

297
00:20:48,311 --> 00:20:50,707
Totally get why he was demoted to archives, now.

298
00:20:50,856 --> 00:20:52,675
Shibazaki had a family.

299
00:20:53,338 --> 00:20:58,649
He had his life. The only thing he could
do at that point was accept the transfer.

300
00:20:59,558 --> 00:21:03,381
However, he has never forgotten.

301
00:21:03,878 --> 00:21:07,728
And he hasn't given up. That was a long summer.

302
00:21:12,405 --> 00:21:14,380
Nother hot one again today.
