1
00:01:36,092 --> 00:01:38,050
We have a special news bulletin.

2
00:01:38,075 --> 00:01:40,277
According to the information we just received,

3
00:01:40,335 --> 00:01:43,175
the serial bombing terrorists... terrorist group, Sphinx,

4
00:01:43,219 --> 00:01:45,802
have made a proclamation. The
government and related agen...

5
00:01:45,827 --> 00:01:49,440
An announcement was made stating a nuclear
device will go off at 10 o'clock this evening.

6
00:01:49,465 --> 00:01:53,748
Upon hearing the proclamation, the Chief
Cabinet Secretary held a press conference.

7
00:01:53,773 --> 00:01:56,169
Earlier this evening at precisely 8:21,

8
00:01:56,212 --> 00:01:59,702
The government declared an official state of emergency.

9
00:02:00,089 --> 00:02:05,116
The entire Kanto region has been
designated an emergency danger zone.

10
00:02:05,259 --> 00:02:10,425
To maintain public order, we have requested
that the ground Self-Defense Force be dispatched.

11
00:02:10,583 --> 00:02:14,781
We ask that all citizens within the
danger zone, and surrounding areas,

12
00:02:14,806 --> 00:02:16,535
evacuate immediately.

13
00:02:19,405 --> 00:02:20,304
You're alive!

14
00:02:23,301 --> 00:02:24,074
Hey!

15
00:02:26,967 --> 00:02:30,430
Oh no! Are you okay? Talk to me! Twelve!

16
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:38,767
Those guys are seriously gonna do it, aren't they?

17
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:41,419
This is the revenge they've been after.

18
00:02:41,444 --> 00:02:43,437
No. I don't think so.

19
00:02:43,818 --> 00:02:44,397
Huh?

20
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:45,497
We're sorry.

21
00:02:45,522 --> 00:02:47,403
Your call cannot be completed at this time.

22
00:02:47,595 --> 00:02:48,815
Think about it, man.

23
00:02:49,218 --> 00:02:50,860
They haven't killed anyone, right?

24
00:02:51,134 --> 00:02:51,687
What?

25
00:02:52,234 --> 00:02:54,889
During the bombing at the Tokyo government office,

26
00:02:54,941 --> 00:03:00,004
they rigged the fire alarms to go off so they could make
sure everyone evacuated before the building collapsed.

27
00:03:01,529 --> 00:03:02,969
Roppongi Station, too.

28
00:03:03,115 --> 00:03:06,441
They put in a webcam and detonated
the bomb when no one was around.

29
00:03:07,513 --> 00:03:12,351
And at the airport, they even went so far
as to disarm the device planted to frame them.

30
00:03:13,088 --> 00:03:15,341
Sphinx is no ordinary terrorist group.

31
00:03:15,967 --> 00:03:17,625
They have a specific goal.

32
00:03:18,563 --> 00:03:20,997
Something important they want the world to know.

33
00:03:26,614 --> 00:03:27,757
Dad, are you there?

34
00:03:27,908 --> 00:03:30,741
Haruka! You got a sec? I got a question for you.

35
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:32,020
Where are you, Dad?

36
00:03:32,146 --> 00:03:33,927
Please, tell me you're evacuating.

37
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:35,955
Calm down. I'll be fine.

38
00:03:36,234 --> 00:03:37,624
What do you mean, fine?

39
00:03:37,902 --> 00:03:41,193
Listen to me. I promise I'll get out of here.

40
00:03:41,496 --> 00:03:42,743
I just have to finish up.

41
00:03:45,775 --> 00:03:47,872
Good. Now, what did you want to ask me?

42
00:03:47,983 --> 00:03:50,922
Is there a way to use an atomic
bomb without killing anyone?

43
00:03:50,947 --> 00:03:51,408
What?

44
00:03:51,641 --> 00:03:56,118
Like, an atomic bomb explodes,
but without a single casualty.

45
00:03:56,471 --> 00:03:58,440
Is something like that possible?

46
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:06,134
I think so. I've uh, I've heard of like,
a high-altitude nuclear explosion before.

47
00:04:06,203 --> 00:04:07,258
Sorry, I missed that.

48
00:04:07,342 --> 00:04:09,448
Oh, high altitude.

49
00:04:09,576 --> 00:04:14,106
It'd be a nuclear explosion, but instead
of on land, it's in the stratosphere!

50
00:04:14,284 --> 00:04:15,513
The stratosphere?

51
00:04:16,165 --> 00:04:20,549
During an experiment in America, though,
there was a large-scale power outage.

52
00:04:21,135 --> 00:04:24,325
How would they get a bomb into
the stratosphere in the first place?

53
00:04:25,978 --> 00:04:27,975
I know how. With a balloon!

54
00:04:28,505 --> 00:04:31,088
Saw it once in college. They put a camera on one.

55
00:04:31,185 --> 00:04:33,650
Buncha students sent it up to take pictures of Earth.

56
00:04:34,093 --> 00:04:35,400
I'll hafta call you back!

57
00:04:37,946 --> 00:04:40,484
Shibazaki! What are you doing here?

58
00:04:40,568 --> 00:04:42,010
I thought you were fired.

59
00:04:42,192 --> 00:04:43,275
You're comin' with us.

60
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:46,990
What? No, wait, aw, Shibazaki!

61
00:04:56,181 --> 00:04:58,870
Nothing. I can't get through.

62
00:05:01,334 --> 00:05:04,702
Twelve. Wake up. Please.

63
00:05:07,152 --> 00:05:09,055
That the National weather service?

64
00:05:09,583 --> 00:05:11,625
Yes, sir, but they don't know anything, yet.

65
00:05:11,801 --> 00:05:14,249
Hamura, any reports of a balloon?

66
00:05:14,388 --> 00:05:15,717
Checking on that, now!

67
00:05:16,967 --> 00:05:19,128
The roof! I'll head up there now!

68
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:22,939
Guys, take a look at this.

69
00:05:23,175 --> 00:05:23,619
Huh?

70
00:05:25,389 --> 00:05:27,709
This footage is from about 43 minutes ago.

71
00:05:28,152 --> 00:05:30,033
It's from a camera inside the city.

72
00:05:30,194 --> 00:05:32,450
Went up the same time as the bomb announcement.

73
00:05:36,774 --> 00:05:37,894
There's no question.

74
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:40,522
The explosion will be in the sky.

75
00:05:53,889 --> 00:05:54,514
Roger.

76
00:05:54,673 --> 00:05:55,567
Understood.

77
00:05:55,921 --> 00:05:58,026
This is from an information-gathering satellite.

78
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:02,498
The balloon is currently ascending
to 10,000 meters above the Kanto area.

79
00:06:02,675 --> 00:06:03,305
Good work.

80
00:06:03,531 --> 00:06:06,073
Request dispatch of the Air Self-Defense Force.

81
00:06:06,469 --> 00:06:08,275
A high-altitude nuclear blast.

82
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:10,754
So the explosion will be in the upper atmosphere.

83
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:14,300
The radiation will disperse
out into space, but in exchange,

84
00:06:14,325 --> 00:06:17,463
it will most likely generate
a strong electromagnetic pulse.

85
00:06:18,237 --> 00:06:19,258
And that means what?

86
00:06:19,535 --> 00:06:22,485
Well, to put it simply, if the pulse is strong enough,

87
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:26,025
it means it will probably destroy
most of the electronics in the country.

88
00:06:27,435 --> 00:06:28,715
I hope you're wrong about that.

89
00:06:29,484 --> 00:06:32,183
Or we're all hosed. Japan will be paralyzed.

90
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:34,518
Then what's the goal?

91
00:06:35,116 --> 00:06:38,430
Why knock the whole country back into a literal Dark Age?

92
00:06:40,251 --> 00:06:42,198
Contact the cabinet's crisis center.

93
00:06:43,273 --> 00:06:46,440
To start with, get all the nuclear power plants shut down.

94
00:06:46,465 --> 00:06:47,266
Yes, sir.

95
00:06:47,712 --> 00:06:49,936
Hold on, what'll happen to aircraft?

96
00:06:50,212 --> 00:06:53,819
That would depend on if the
plane has Anti-EMP equipment or not.

97
00:06:54,232 --> 00:06:56,049
Those without it will crash.

98
00:06:56,883 --> 00:06:59,286
And how many have the necessary equipment?

99
00:07:00,594 --> 00:07:04,078
Zero. Unless you count the U.S. forces.

100
00:07:04,103 --> 00:07:07,288
Right now, they have the only
planes in Japan with Anti-EMP.

101
00:07:15,031 --> 00:07:16,015
Twelve!

102
00:07:27,746 --> 00:07:30,514
I'm so glad you're okay.

103
00:07:31,161 --> 00:07:32,001
Lisa...

104
00:07:47,943 --> 00:07:53,092
Contact all planes and helicopters currently
in the air. We need them on the ground, now.

105
00:07:53,203 --> 00:07:55,898
We're counting over 250 aircraft flying, sir.

106
00:07:56,185 --> 00:07:58,664
It'll take at least an hour and
a half to land them all safely.

107
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,857
Not soon enough! You have 30 minutes!

108
00:08:11,414 --> 00:08:13,650
Call the Welfare and Transportation Ministries.

109
00:08:13,733 --> 00:08:16,582
Put all medical and transportation facilities on alert!

110
00:08:16,607 --> 00:08:17,321
Yessir!

111
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:20,611
Echo 0-1.

112
00:08:20,636 --> 00:08:23,803
Target 0-6-0. Decrease 4-8 miles.

113
00:08:23,828 --> 00:08:25,395
Altitude 6-6-0.

114
00:08:25,587 --> 00:08:27,618
Roger, it's on my radar.

115
00:08:27,701 --> 00:08:31,317
12 o'clock, 4-8 miles. Altitude 6-6-0.

116
00:08:31,505 --> 00:08:32,387
That's your target.

117
00:08:33,051 --> 00:08:33,955
Roger.

118
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:50,490
Echo 0-1, target dead ahead

119
00:08:50,515 --> 00:08:51,444
1-8 miles.

120
00:08:51,469 --> 00:08:52,990
Roger. Tally-ho.

121
00:08:53,125 --> 00:08:55,334
Target. Approaching the mark, now.

122
00:08:55,596 --> 00:08:58,755
Roger. Tally-ho. Another, no stranger.

123
00:09:00,068 --> 00:09:02,839
Air Self-Defense Force has made visual confirmation.

124
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:10,148
So, is Nine really trying to destroy the whole world?

125
00:09:10,701 --> 00:09:15,024
When the atomic bomb explodes, will it kill everyone?

126
00:09:18,738 --> 00:09:23,455
Rising sun, Echo 0-1 aborting mission.

127
00:09:23,759 --> 00:09:26,176
Reaching climb limitation.

128
00:09:27,816 --> 00:09:30,175
Balloon's going beyond the plane's altitude limit.

129
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,739
We won't be able to follow it any farther.

130
00:09:34,032 --> 00:09:37,928
Where we were raised, no one
had any parents, let alone family.

131
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:42,015
It was a dark place. A lonely place.

132
00:09:50,086 --> 00:09:53,204
Even after we escaped, we were still always alone.

133
00:09:53,608 --> 00:09:56,142
Just us two. Nine and me.

134
00:09:57,308 --> 00:09:59,828
Neither one of us was ever needed by anyone,

135
00:10:00,509 --> 00:10:01,688
except each other.

136
00:10:07,617 --> 00:10:09,361
Less than three minutes until the blast!

137
00:10:09,941 --> 00:10:10,900
The aircraft?

138
00:10:10,925 --> 00:10:12,229
Four still to land!

139
00:10:16,305 --> 00:10:17,201
That's why.

140
00:10:21,244 --> 00:10:22,942
They'll be on the ground momentarily, sir.

141
00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:29,255
Oh, Lisa. Thank you.

142
00:10:29,928 --> 00:10:32,936
I'm glad we met. You saved me.

143
00:13:26,509 --> 00:13:28,268
Nine. I, uh...

144
00:13:29,593 --> 00:13:32,162
The grenade. It was you, wasn't it?

145
00:13:32,491 --> 00:13:33,115
Uh...

146
00:13:33,803 --> 00:13:36,196
You're the only one who would pull something like that.

147
00:13:37,954 --> 00:13:39,198
Guess I owe you one.

148
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:21,563
Took long enough, but I finally made it here.

149
00:15:22,417 --> 00:15:23,983
This is your hometown, isn't it?

150
00:15:25,323 --> 00:15:27,626
The place Sphinx wanted everyone to see.

151
00:15:28,646 --> 00:15:31,803
Well, you've definitely got the whole world's attention.

152
00:15:33,172 --> 00:15:36,101
They all wanna know who you are, where you came from.

153
00:15:36,565 --> 00:15:40,478
Hell, media outlets across the
planet are desperate to find out.

154
00:15:41,965 --> 00:15:42,945
If you're caught,

155
00:15:42,970 --> 00:15:45,286
everything that happened to you will come out in the open.

156
00:15:45,612 --> 00:15:46,666
It would have to.

157
00:15:47,431 --> 00:15:51,600
At this point, you've created such a
fire-storm no one can ignore it anymore.

158
00:15:52,646 --> 00:15:54,490
So the world is ready to listen.

159
00:15:55,225 --> 00:15:57,553
Which, I'm assuming was your goal the whole time.

160
00:15:59,108 --> 00:15:59,787
Am I right?

161
00:16:00,528 --> 00:16:02,763
Were you planning to be caught from the very beginning?

162
00:16:03,226 --> 00:16:05,643
Yeah, but we needed something.

163
00:16:05,858 --> 00:16:07,485
Well, needed someone.

164
00:16:07,858 --> 00:16:10,550
We couldn't be captured if no one figured that out.

165
00:16:12,529 --> 00:16:16,312
You were our Oedipus, Shibazaki. It was always you.

166
00:16:19,167 --> 00:16:22,890
All right, then. Sphinx, you're under arrest!

167
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:27,213
About her, she's just a hostage.

168
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:29,327
Please protect her.

169
00:16:41,002 --> 00:16:43,224
Americans? What do they want, now?

170
00:16:53,172 --> 00:16:54,870
I am holding a detonator.

171
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:58,426
While, the atomic bomb may be no more,

172
00:16:58,451 --> 00:17:00,995
there are countless others like it in this country.

173
00:17:01,634 --> 00:17:02,623
They're all over.

174
00:17:03,739 --> 00:17:06,158
The one this detonator is connected to,

175
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:08,981
is in a nuclear power plant!

176
00:17:09,922 --> 00:17:10,430
Tch!

177
00:17:10,770 --> 00:17:13,144
If the U.S. forces do not withdraw.

178
00:17:13,219 --> 00:17:14,824
I will set this off!

179
00:17:16,479 --> 00:17:17,604
Correct, sir.

180
00:17:17,629 --> 00:17:19,194
That's what he's claimin'.

181
00:17:19,309 --> 00:17:20,754
Carry out your duties.

182
00:17:20,817 --> 00:17:21,860
But if we do...

183
00:17:22,384 --> 00:17:25,734
The mere existence of someone who
knows the truth about the airport

184
00:17:25,765 --> 00:17:29,530
and the Shuto Expressway
incident puts us at a disadvantage.

185
00:17:29,648 --> 00:17:33,252
Even if the bomb is real,
nothing can be done about it now.

186
00:17:34,141 --> 00:17:34,927
Yes, sir.

187
00:17:35,518 --> 00:17:37,187
Don't kill the detective.

188
00:17:37,793 --> 00:17:41,952
If he accuses the Japanese government,
it will turn attention away from us.

189
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:43,178
Understood.

190
00:18:28,851 --> 00:18:30,685
No, wait! Don't do it!

191
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:36,494
Hold fire! Hold fire!

192
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:39,250
Please, let me talk to him first!

193
00:18:43,449 --> 00:18:46,068
I will make sure everything comes to light in court.

194
00:18:46,650 --> 00:18:48,683
That's why you put your lives on the line.

195
00:18:48,969 --> 00:18:50,523
That's all you really wanted.

196
00:18:51,403 --> 00:18:55,041
I promise. The world will know the truth.

197
00:19:06,582 --> 00:19:09,155
All right. I'll let you finish it.

198
00:19:18,269 --> 00:19:23,602
Thank you. But, I have one more favor to ask.

199
00:19:26,587 --> 00:19:32,247
Remember us. Remember that we lived.

200
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:52,859
I saw the entire thing with my own eyes,

201
00:19:53,168 --> 00:19:55,153
and I still couldn't believe it was real.

202
00:19:55,563 --> 00:19:57,959
A lot of people came to ask me about it,

203
00:19:58,541 --> 00:20:00,351
but I couldn't talk about anything.

204
00:20:01,811 --> 00:20:05,368
I thought for a while I wouldn't be
able to talk for the rest of my life.

205
00:20:06,550 --> 00:20:08,578
I was so sure about that, too,

206
00:20:08,963 --> 00:20:10,946
but, gradually, I got used to it.

207
00:20:11,402 --> 00:20:13,441
And then, before I knew what had happened,

208
00:20:13,655 --> 00:20:15,012
a year had passed.

209
00:20:20,905 --> 00:20:21,585
Hey, there.

210
00:20:22,466 --> 00:20:24,451
Guessing you were just visiting the grave?

211
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:25,860
Yes.

212
00:20:26,532 --> 00:20:28,188
I'm headed there now, actually.

213
00:20:29,550 --> 00:20:32,368
I, um, I just wanna thank you for everything.

214
00:20:32,432 --> 00:20:33,582
You're very welcome.

215
00:20:34,117 --> 00:20:35,659
I'm always here if you need me.

216
00:20:36,208 --> 00:20:40,575
Did I, did I tell you about how Nine loved music?

217
00:20:41,025 --> 00:20:41,602
No.

218
00:20:41,944 --> 00:20:43,577
Well one time.

219
00:20:43,842 --> 00:20:46,810
I asked him what he was always listening to, and

220
00:20:47,690 --> 00:20:50,317
he said it was music from a "cold place".

221
00:20:50,705 --> 00:20:52,709
Then, he told me it was from Iceland.

222
00:20:54,794 --> 00:21:00,064
V-O-N. It's an Icelandic word.
Have you heard of that before?

223
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:02,842
Nine told me it means "hope".

224
00:21:04,090 --> 00:21:05,163
Of course.

225
00:21:06,991 --> 00:21:09,302
Well, see ya.

226
00:21:09,795 --> 00:21:11,866
Yeah. Be well.
