1
00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:05,546
Plus wi-fi...

2
00:00:11,199 --> 00:00:13,361
Choice one, you can die where you stand.

3
00:00:13,706 --> 00:00:16,637
Or choice two: you can become an accomplice.

4
00:00:25,587 --> 00:00:28,119
Lisa, there's no going back.

5
00:02:27,808 --> 00:02:29,687
We're here at the scene of the bombing.

6
00:02:29,712 --> 00:02:32,682
The police have concluded this was not an accident.

7
00:02:32,707 --> 00:02:35,074
What we experienced was an act of terror.

8
00:02:35,377 --> 00:02:39,458
In their official statement, the police
promised to take down these terrorists.

9
00:02:47,498 --> 00:02:48,581
Lisa!

10
00:02:48,805 --> 00:02:51,263
Do you know how many times I texted you?

11
00:02:51,288 --> 00:02:53,618
Why would you wanna make me worry like that?

12
00:02:53,993 --> 00:02:55,420
I'm sorry, Mom.

13
00:02:55,524 --> 00:02:56,739
No, you're not.

14
00:02:56,795 --> 00:02:58,344
This is all a part of your plan!

15
00:02:58,390 --> 00:02:58,910
Wha...?

16
00:02:58,935 --> 00:03:01,337
Don't lie to me! Please tell me the truth.

17
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:02,846
What are you trying to do to me?

18
00:03:02,871 --> 00:03:03,673
Please stop.

19
00:03:03,698 --> 00:03:06,212
Are you planning to run away just like your father?

20
00:03:06,295 --> 00:03:10,200
You're going to leave me, too. I won't allow it! Lisa! No!

21
00:03:11,915 --> 00:03:14,941
Come back here! Lisa!

22
00:03:22,837 --> 00:03:26,126
In that moment, I was terrified.

23
00:03:29,462 --> 00:03:31,314
It wasn't my mother, though.

24
00:03:31,379 --> 00:03:33,258
I was afraid of something else.

25
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:36,624
Lisa, there's no going back.

26
00:03:37,381 --> 00:03:38,792
The words he said,

27
00:03:39,406 --> 00:03:41,354
and how cold they made me feel.

28
00:03:50,669 --> 00:03:52,169
Can those in the back hear all right?

29
00:03:52,194 --> 00:03:53,454
Yes sir, we can hear.

30
00:03:53,576 --> 00:03:54,581
Sounds fine to me.

31
00:03:54,606 --> 00:03:56,212
Welcome. I'm Kurahashi.

32
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:59,719
The First Investigation Division Chief. To start with,

33
00:03:59,828 --> 00:04:02,141
we'll hear updates from the different departments.

34
00:04:02,214 --> 00:04:05,130
All right. Director Shimada will share casualties.

35
00:04:05,233 --> 00:04:05,804
Thank you.

36
00:04:07,159 --> 00:04:09,208
Before the Government Offices collapse,

37
00:04:09,254 --> 00:04:11,044
the building's fire alarm was triggered

38
00:04:11,069 --> 00:04:12,764
allowing a full evacuation.

39
00:04:12,983 --> 00:04:15,205
As far as we know, there were no fatalities.

40
00:04:15,312 --> 00:04:17,437
There were 27 injuries reported,

41
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,402
but they were all relatively minor.

42
00:04:19,577 --> 00:04:21,385
We got lucky on this one, guys.

43
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:23,661
Considering the scale of the damage,

44
00:04:23,686 --> 00:04:25,488
these numbers are extremely low.

45
00:04:25,768 --> 00:04:29,289
Thank you, and now to Division
Chief Kinoshita from Cybercrime.

46
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:30,169
Thanks.

47
00:04:31,205 --> 00:04:35,511
Regarding the video the alleged suspects
uploaded on the day the incident occurred,

48
00:04:35,556 --> 00:04:37,211
there's not much to report yet.

49
00:04:37,518 --> 00:04:41,289
We know they used anonymity software
called Tor when accessing the Internet.

50
00:04:41,847 --> 00:04:44,979
So, basically, it's impossible
to determine their IP address.

51
00:04:45,004 --> 00:04:47,869
Excuse me! I'm Hamura from First Division.

52
00:04:48,062 --> 00:04:51,406
From watching the video, it seems
like the suspects are a couple of kids.

53
00:04:51,431 --> 00:04:53,819
Is there any way to find out if
their threat was the real deal?

54
00:04:54,629 --> 00:04:57,587
It's possible. We are analyzing the video again.

55
00:04:58,016 --> 00:05:01,674
Next up. Okano, head of Special Investigations.

56
00:05:01,795 --> 00:05:04,895
He'll be reporting on the
surveillance video from the crime scene.

57
00:05:05,018 --> 00:05:07,687
Yes, at this point in time,

58
00:05:07,733 --> 00:05:10,412
we have not found anyone that looks like the suspects.

59
00:05:10,763 --> 00:05:13,531
Thanks to the large-scale
blackout right before the incident,

60
00:05:13,581 --> 00:05:17,170
the cameras stopped for a period of time,
and it is believed they placed the bombs

61
00:05:17,195 --> 00:05:20,651
in the 25 minutes it took for
the backup generators to kick in.

62
00:05:21,077 --> 00:05:22,452
Sorry, but,

63
00:05:22,697 --> 00:05:26,721
are we also looking into the possibility these
suspects might have been behind the blackout?

64
00:05:28,275 --> 00:05:31,446
The Special Investigation team
is following up on that, now.

65
00:05:31,652 --> 00:05:34,920
That's correct. We're in the process
of interviewing the construction workers

66
00:05:34,985 --> 00:05:37,670
involved with the crane accident that caused the outage.

67
00:05:38,339 --> 00:05:40,922
Finally, Section Chief Hamada from Forensics.

68
00:05:41,045 --> 00:05:43,534
Please give us your professional opinion about the bomb.

69
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:49,396
Yes, sir. But, before that, I'd like to talk
about the structure of the government office.

70
00:05:49,538 --> 00:05:53,312
The pillars that support the frame of the
building are, in fact, four times thicker than usual,

71
00:05:53,378 --> 00:05:57,445
and due to that particular strength, they
are commonly referred to as "super pillars."

72
00:05:57,484 --> 00:06:01,599
They were created with attacks in mind, so
they can't be destroyed by standard bombs.

73
00:06:02,428 --> 00:06:03,412
To be clear.

74
00:06:03,955 --> 00:06:07,020
You're telling us these were not run-of-the-mill devices?

75
00:06:07,045 --> 00:06:08,997
Thermite reaction tells you they weren't.

76
00:06:09,212 --> 00:06:13,307
Um, an on-site investigation detected
the chemical reaction was present.

77
00:06:13,465 --> 00:06:14,875
A thermite reaction?

78
00:06:15,337 --> 00:06:17,870
Is that unusual in your experience, Chief?

79
00:06:18,127 --> 00:06:21,557
No, on the contrary, this reaction's extremely common.

80
00:06:21,669 --> 00:06:24,534
As a matter of fact, it's an
everyday practice for welding metal.

81
00:06:25,049 --> 00:06:29,420
To put it very simply, if a mixture of
iron oxide and aluminum powder is ignited,

82
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:31,240
it produces a large amount of heat.

83
00:06:31,396 --> 00:06:33,635
Up to 3,000 degrees Celsius.

84
00:06:34,655 --> 00:06:38,729
Such a high temperature is greater than
the melting point of both iron and concrete,

85
00:06:38,754 --> 00:06:41,758
which means the reaction has
the ability to melt either one.

86
00:06:42,346 --> 00:06:47,705
The ingredients required to create such a reaction
are also quite a bit easier to obtain than gunpowder.

87
00:06:48,008 --> 00:06:50,615
Are you're saying this is what
was used to melt the pillars?

88
00:06:50,755 --> 00:06:52,754
It more than likely was, yes.

89
00:06:52,931 --> 00:06:55,864
The purpose of the mixture was to set off the fire alarms.

90
00:06:56,060 --> 00:07:00,374
Then, once the water from the sprinklers
combined with it, a phreatic explosion was created.

91
00:07:01,184 --> 00:07:06,126
At that point, the pillars, unable to withstand the weight
of the building, collapsed along with the structure.

92
00:07:06,586 --> 00:07:10,505
There have not been many terrorist attacks
that have used this method in the past.

93
00:07:10,609 --> 00:07:15,511
However, these bombers didn't just use the reaction,
they planned for the phreatic explosion as well.

94
00:07:15,562 --> 00:07:19,703
Whoever is behind this assault is
without a doubt extremely intelligent.

95
00:07:21,098 --> 00:07:22,571
That being said,

96
00:07:22,924 --> 00:07:25,423
there's still one thing I can't figure out.

97
00:07:25,786 --> 00:07:26,929
And that would be?

98
00:07:26,988 --> 00:07:30,973
Strangely enough, there was a
single TNT bomb used in the attack.

99
00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:33,300
In no way could that have been necessary to cause

100
00:07:33,325 --> 00:07:36,257
the collapse of the building, so I decided to reconstruct

101
00:07:36,282 --> 00:07:39,761
the TNT bomb myself to see if I
could find out why it was there.

102
00:07:39,819 --> 00:07:42,542
What? I didn't know you could reconstruct a bomb.

103
00:07:42,634 --> 00:07:45,822
Oh, it's not all that difficult when TNT is being used.

104
00:07:46,108 --> 00:07:51,059
Anyway, on the TNT, I found letters that
looked like they had been written by the bombers.

105
00:07:51,084 --> 00:07:51,819
And?

106
00:07:52,252 --> 00:07:53,808
This is what I discovered.

107
00:07:55,785 --> 00:07:57,476
You can see them very clearly.

108
00:07:57,676 --> 00:08:01,131
Three letters. V-O-N.

109
00:08:18,386 --> 00:08:22,670
Can you believe Public Safety is letting
First Division lead a terrorist investigation?

110
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,733
Of course.

111
00:08:23,917 --> 00:08:26,542
If this thing turns into a worst-case scenario,

112
00:08:27,031 --> 00:08:30,931
both the media and the police department
want to be certain they can still cover it up.

113
00:08:31,736 --> 00:08:33,331
V-O-N.

114
00:08:33,633 --> 00:08:34,287
Yeah.

115
00:08:34,921 --> 00:08:37,413
Guess we know it's connected to that recent theft.

116
00:08:41,045 --> 00:08:43,160
If the public finds out, they'll panic.

117
00:08:44,386 --> 00:08:45,520
Indeed, they will.

118
00:08:45,762 --> 00:08:50,209
We need to consider the likelihood that these
attackers are not with an existing terrorist cell.

119
00:08:50,295 --> 00:08:51,262
I agree.

120
00:08:51,349 --> 00:08:55,521
But the Public Safety Bureau does not, and
we're supposed to be cooperating with them...

121
00:08:55,716 --> 00:08:57,008
indirectly, of course.

122
00:08:57,045 --> 00:08:58,327
No surprise there.

123
00:08:58,616 --> 00:09:01,697
If things don't go well, they
want the freedom to blame us.

124
00:09:15,254 --> 00:09:16,344
Huh?

125
00:09:22,761 --> 00:09:26,639
Hey Nine, did you catch that news report?

126
00:09:26,965 --> 00:09:29,893
Assume you mean the one comparing us to the Unabomber.

127
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:31,261
That's the one!

128
00:09:31,293 --> 00:09:33,941
I was hoping to remind them of Kenji Sawada, though.

129
00:09:36,572 --> 00:09:37,898
Hear from that girl?

130
00:09:37,923 --> 00:09:39,164
Lisa Mishima?

131
00:09:39,442 --> 00:09:40,157
Yeah.

132
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:41,512
You worried?

133
00:09:41,673 --> 00:09:45,096
Nah. I can't imagine she has the guts to report us.

134
00:09:45,442 --> 00:09:48,790
Let me ask you something. Why "accomplice"?

135
00:09:48,909 --> 00:09:51,167
Why use that word when you were talking to her?

136
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:53,893
Just trying to scare her.

137
00:09:54,852 --> 00:09:55,937
That's all, huh?

138
00:10:00,338 --> 00:10:01,431
Whose turn?

139
00:10:02,129 --> 00:10:05,463
Hmm. One, two,

140
00:10:05,565 --> 00:10:06,329
Three!

141
00:10:17,088 --> 00:10:19,755
Hello. Delivery from Choujyuan Noodles.

142
00:10:20,056 --> 00:10:22,087
Oh. Yeah, just bring it on in.

143
00:10:22,112 --> 00:10:23,467
Cool. Thank you.

144
00:10:39,527 --> 00:10:41,854
Yeah, tried that new ramen place last night.

145
00:10:41,893 --> 00:10:43,187
You gotta go.

146
00:11:13,850 --> 00:11:15,360
I don't get you, man.

147
00:11:15,592 --> 00:11:17,510
How can you work on a crossword puzzle?

148
00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:21,810
First Division looks like they're
in serious trouble, you know.

149
00:11:21,907 --> 00:11:24,748
But I guess that doesn't affect us down here in archives.

150
00:11:25,049 --> 00:11:27,879
Which is why you're just screwing around online.

151
00:11:28,325 --> 00:11:29,324
Hey, help me out.

152
00:11:29,349 --> 00:11:33,803
Do you know what the "instant pork ramen
from 1987 that was recently reissued" is?

153
00:11:33,837 --> 00:11:34,856
Oh, come on!

154
00:11:35,089 --> 00:11:39,264
Maybe you could help me out and not assume
all fat people are experts on carbs, yeah?

155
00:11:39,344 --> 00:11:41,879
Oh. Try Toppa Chikara Kusa Yantsuki.

156
00:11:42,072 --> 00:11:45,267
Ah. T.O.P.

157
00:11:45,292 --> 00:11:47,094
And I'm not screwing around, by the way.

158
00:11:47,728 --> 00:11:51,435
I'm secretly and covertly trying to
figure out what Sphinx's next move could be.

159
00:11:52,815 --> 00:11:56,398
Too late! They released a new video!

160
00:11:58,714 --> 00:12:00,678
I'm Sphinx Number One.

161
00:12:00,891 --> 00:12:03,997
I'm Sphinx Two, and I heart explosions!

162
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:07,118
Did you enjoy the fireworks
at the Tokyo Government Office?

163
00:12:07,231 --> 00:12:10,784
All that excitement came from our very own handmade bombs.

164
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:12,979
He worked pretty hard on it, too!

165
00:12:13,004 --> 00:12:15,338
This is only the beginning of the party, though!

166
00:12:15,363 --> 00:12:19,003
In the very near future, we'll
be setting off a second bomb!

167
00:12:19,537 --> 00:12:21,265
We have a riddle for everyone.

168
00:12:21,290 --> 00:12:23,181
Specifically those of you from law enforcement.

169
00:12:23,206 --> 00:12:24,026
What?

170
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:29,395
What first walks on two legs, then on four legs,

171
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:31,932
and finally on three legs?

172
00:12:32,492 --> 00:12:35,880
If you solve the riddle, then the next bomb can be yours!

173
00:12:35,905 --> 00:12:36,940
Good luck!

174
00:12:37,005 --> 00:12:39,172
Aw, poor First Division.

175
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:42,549
Those guys sure as hell won't be goin' home for a while.

176
00:13:16,505 --> 00:13:18,181
The hell's the point of a riddle?

177
00:13:19,244 --> 00:13:21,993
Damn snots need to learn some respect!

178
00:13:22,087 --> 00:13:23,093
How dare they?

179
00:13:23,352 --> 00:13:26,067
They could just be mouthpieces for the real guys.

180
00:13:26,496 --> 00:13:28,982
In the long run though, I guess it doesn't matter.

181
00:13:30,883 --> 00:13:34,405
The last thing we need right now
is children using bombs as toys.

182
00:13:34,462 --> 00:13:35,485
Director Kurahashi.

183
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:40,703
The suspects refer to themselves as "Sphinx,"
pronouncing it with a "P" instead of the usual "F".

184
00:13:40,879 --> 00:13:42,379
This isn't from the Egyptian.

185
00:13:42,404 --> 00:13:44,418
It's actually a Greek pronunciation.

186
00:13:45,801 --> 00:13:46,968
Sphinx.

187
00:13:47,085 --> 00:13:52,466
Commonly known as one of the many creatures
from Greek mythology. It appears in Oedipus Rex.

188
00:13:53,331 --> 00:13:55,430
Laius, Oedipus's father,

189
00:13:55,533 --> 00:13:59,799
after being told by an Oracle that
his son would kill him, abandoned Oedipus

190
00:13:59,837 --> 00:14:02,241
in the forest when he was still just a child.

191
00:14:03,289 --> 00:14:06,664
However, Oedipus survived and grew into an adult.

192
00:14:06,833 --> 00:14:10,583
The Oracle was right, and one day,
Oedipus did end up killing Laius.

193
00:14:10,652 --> 00:14:14,198
Of course, at the time, he did
not know Laius was his father.

194
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:18,099
Afterwards, Oedipus married the king's wife.

195
00:14:18,383 --> 00:14:20,589
But Queen Jocasta was his mother.

196
00:14:23,097 --> 00:14:25,269
When Oedipus discovered the truth,

197
00:14:25,728 --> 00:14:27,825
that he had murdered his own father,

198
00:14:28,216 --> 00:14:30,277
that he had married his own mother.

199
00:14:30,921 --> 00:14:34,165
He could not bear the guilt,
and in order to punish himself,

200
00:14:35,545 --> 00:14:39,470
he gouged out his eyes, making himself blind.

201
00:14:43,486 --> 00:14:44,299
Whatcha readin'?

202
00:14:44,324 --> 00:14:46,954
Oh, I... n-nothing.

203
00:14:47,477 --> 00:14:48,168
Hm.

204
00:14:53,991 --> 00:14:57,489
Um, if you don't mind me asking, why are you here?

205
00:14:58,151 --> 00:15:01,109
I understand if you're keeping tabs.

206
00:15:01,134 --> 00:15:02,548
It makes perfect sense.

207
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:04,868
You wanna learn a fun trick?

208
00:15:04,892 --> 00:15:05,373
Huh?

209
00:15:05,596 --> 00:15:07,241
I'll just take that as a yes.

210
00:15:07,443 --> 00:15:10,551
First, make a blend of half cola and half green tea.

211
00:15:11,295 --> 00:15:14,242
Here you go. Then, put this in and laugh.

212
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:22,623
It's the fresh maker cola!

213
00:15:22,648 --> 00:15:24,190
Hey! Hold on a sec!

214
00:15:34,082 --> 00:15:36,428
Oedipus went to visit the country of his father,

215
00:15:36,453 --> 00:15:39,772
whom he had killed. He was confronted there.

216
00:15:39,986 --> 00:15:42,040
A monster appeared and blocked his way.

217
00:15:43,233 --> 00:15:45,864
The Sphinx asked riddles of the people it encountered.

218
00:15:45,889 --> 00:15:48,867
If they didn't give the correct
answer, they would be devoured.

219
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:52,680
Sounds fun. What kind of riddles are we talkin'?

220
00:15:53,257 --> 00:15:55,299
"What walks on four legs in the morning,

221
00:15:55,462 --> 00:15:57,295
on two legs in the afternoon,

222
00:15:57,547 --> 00:15:59,462
and on three legs in the evening?"

223
00:15:59,719 --> 00:16:01,195
That's right.

224
00:16:01,867 --> 00:16:04,154
It's very similar to the riddle in the video.

225
00:16:04,379 --> 00:16:06,624
We need to take these guys seriously.

226
00:16:06,690 --> 00:16:08,964
Okay, if that's the question, what's the answer?

227
00:16:09,837 --> 00:16:11,265
The answer is "man."

228
00:16:11,337 --> 00:16:12,254
How come?

229
00:16:12,283 --> 00:16:13,230
I get it.

230
00:16:13,358 --> 00:16:16,352
As an infant, man is forced to crawl on four legs.

231
00:16:16,462 --> 00:16:18,525
Then as adults, we walk on two.

232
00:16:18,893 --> 00:16:21,237
Elderly people use canes, which makes three.

233
00:16:21,262 --> 00:16:23,697
Correct. And the times of day?

234
00:16:24,209 --> 00:16:26,780
They represent the different stages in a man's life.

235
00:16:26,805 --> 00:16:30,238
So how does that relate to
the next bomb they've set "Man?"

236
00:16:31,810 --> 00:16:33,371
Yeah, or people?

237
00:16:33,879 --> 00:16:37,063
So, a busy shopping area with a lot of foot traffic?

238
00:16:37,088 --> 00:16:39,238
What if those numbers match up to an address?

239
00:16:39,338 --> 00:16:42,102
Like Fourth Street, Building Two-Three or something?

240
00:16:42,127 --> 00:16:44,639
Checking on corresponding addresses, now.

241
00:16:46,932 --> 00:16:49,315
There's a DNA research facility in Minato!

242
00:16:49,742 --> 00:16:52,781
DNA, riddle of man. That has to be it!

243
00:16:52,806 --> 00:16:54,809
Good enough for me, let's get a search warrant.

244
00:16:54,859 --> 00:16:56,263
I'm coming, too.

245
00:17:03,413 --> 00:17:04,177
Come on!

246
00:17:04,208 --> 00:17:05,242
Let's go!

247
00:17:05,862 --> 00:17:07,097
Move now, people!

248
00:17:07,121 --> 00:17:07,602
Yes, sir!

249
00:17:07,627 --> 00:17:08,294
As of right now.

250
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:11,611
Police on the scene, are not
giving us an awful lot of information.

251
00:17:11,636 --> 00:17:16,045
So, we're left to wonder if the next
bomb is at this DNA research facility.

252
00:17:16,070 --> 00:17:18,938
It doesn't seem they're any closer in finding out who...

253
00:17:27,115 --> 00:17:28,682
Ah, Shibazaki.

254
00:17:28,910 --> 00:17:30,064
Oh good.

255
00:17:30,089 --> 00:17:32,134
You haven't changed your number on me, yet.

256
00:17:32,176 --> 00:17:33,213
Not yet.

257
00:17:33,521 --> 00:17:36,882
I've been thinkin' about that riddle
those self-proclaimed bombers left you.

258
00:17:37,170 --> 00:17:38,557
Care to hear my thoughts?

259
00:17:38,582 --> 00:17:42,289
Of course I do. N'you haven't changed a bit, my friend.

260
00:17:43,822 --> 00:17:47,854
Nope. They're referring to the mythology of Oedipus.

261
00:17:47,879 --> 00:17:49,597
Yeah. The answer is "man".

262
00:17:49,997 --> 00:17:50,751
Wrong.

263
00:17:50,939 --> 00:17:54,837
Although "Man" was the answer to
other riddle the Sphinx was known to ask.

264
00:17:54,862 --> 00:17:56,609
You mean it asked more than one?

265
00:17:56,983 --> 00:17:59,905
Yeah, there's another lesser-known version of the story.

266
00:18:00,004 --> 00:18:04,131
Two legs in the morning, four in the
afternoon, and three legs in the evening.

267
00:18:04,156 --> 00:18:06,457
In other words, a two-four-three progression.

268
00:18:06,642 --> 00:18:07,584
Two-four...?

269
00:18:08,037 --> 00:18:10,429
Meaning the answer can't be "man" anymore.

270
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:12,712
So do you know what the answer is?

271
00:18:12,795 --> 00:18:14,726
Yes, it's Oedipus himself.

272
00:18:15,045 --> 00:18:16,663
Gonna have to explain that one.

273
00:18:17,415 --> 00:18:19,832
He started off as a man with two legs,

274
00:18:19,908 --> 00:18:22,374
however, after killing his father and having intercourse

275
00:18:22,399 --> 00:18:25,251
with his mother, he fell to
the level of a beast, so to speak.

276
00:18:25,276 --> 00:18:26,438
That makes four.

277
00:18:26,717 --> 00:18:31,354
In the end, he gouged out his own eyes,
blinding himself. He needed a cane to walk.

278
00:18:31,901 --> 00:18:33,542
So, three legs.

279
00:18:36,318 --> 00:18:38,072
Ah! Watch it!

280
00:18:38,682 --> 00:18:39,843
I'm sorry!

281
00:18:51,908 --> 00:18:54,342
It's true you may be an accomplice.

282
00:18:55,757 --> 00:18:57,407
You're not one of us, though.

283
00:18:59,853 --> 00:19:01,507
So, we know it's Oedipus.

284
00:19:02,254 --> 00:19:03,432
And what did they say?

285
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:07,062
"The riddle was for everyone,
but specifically for the police?"

286
00:19:07,705 --> 00:19:12,404
In my opinion, they're insinuating the
bomb has been planted somewhere the police are.

287
00:19:12,708 --> 00:19:14,004
The police?

288
00:19:14,458 --> 00:19:16,588
If that number sequence is an address.

289
00:19:16,690 --> 00:19:19,116
It corresponds with a local police station.

290
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:21,204
Roppongi Station!

291
00:19:35,462 --> 00:19:36,699
Nothing personal.

292
00:19:37,257 --> 00:19:40,196
But one false move, and I'll have to kill ya.

293
00:19:56,763 --> 00:19:59,219
There's been an explosion in Roppongi?

294
00:20:06,295 --> 00:20:08,679
Shibazaki! Roppongi's been hit!

295
00:20:09,694 --> 00:20:11,207
Damn it. I was too late.

296
00:20:11,453 --> 00:20:12,167
Huh?

297
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:13,937
Director!

298
00:20:14,268 --> 00:20:16,351
There was an explosion at Roppongi Station!

299
00:20:16,482 --> 00:20:19,190
We should take this as a direct
challenge to the police force!

300
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:19,949
Hamura!

301
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:22,145
Head to Roppongi immediately!

302
00:20:22,241 --> 00:20:22,999
Yes, sir!

303
00:20:23,485 --> 00:20:27,738
Shibazaki, understand what I am about
to tell you is highly confidential.

304
00:20:28,450 --> 00:20:33,294
Six months ago, a nuclear fuel reprocessing
facility in Aomori was broken into.

305
00:20:33,629 --> 00:20:35,712
The two criminals stole plutonium.

306
00:20:37,090 --> 00:20:40,269
They vanished immediately, and we have no leads.

307
00:20:40,389 --> 00:20:43,239
However, they did leave something
at the scene of the crime.

308
00:20:44,449 --> 00:20:49,591
A message. The same three letters
left on the TNT at the government office.

309
00:20:50,744 --> 00:20:52,108
Don't tell me.

310
00:20:53,170 --> 00:20:54,107
That's right.

311
00:20:54,415 --> 00:20:59,037
I think these guys have every intention
of picking a fight with this entire country.

312
00:21:00,465 --> 00:21:02,827
We need you back. I'm sorry.

313
00:21:13,242 --> 00:21:16,416
Come on out. I'm waiting for you.
