1
00:00:01,647 --> 00:00:02,730
Goodnight, Romeo.

2
00:00:03,133 --> 00:00:05,046
Parting is such sweet sorrow.

3
00:00:05,152 --> 00:00:08,690
The school! The bomb's in locker D-12!

4
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:10,344
I've regained visual!

5
00:00:10,369 --> 00:00:11,458
No! Stop!

6
00:00:12,851 --> 00:00:13,842
Five, what...?

7
00:01:58,416 --> 00:02:00,769
Excuse me. I'm here to turn myself in.

8
00:02:01,269 --> 00:02:01,902
What?

9
00:02:03,287 --> 00:02:04,853
I'm Sphinx Number One.

10
00:02:08,464 --> 00:02:09,414
Freeze, buddy!

11
00:02:09,439 --> 00:02:10,838
Don't do anything stupid!

12
00:02:10,925 --> 00:02:12,020
Hands behind your head!

13
00:02:13,643 --> 00:02:14,750
You gotta be kiddin' me.

14
00:02:21,421 --> 00:02:23,234
Yes, we're checking to see if it's really him.

15
00:02:23,259 --> 00:02:25,438
Captain! Sphinx just surrendered!

16
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:28,411
What? Is this a joke?

17
00:02:31,175 --> 00:02:33,833
Got it. I'll take care of it right away, sir.

18
00:02:34,915 --> 00:02:39,132
Yeah. Things are still, uh, up in the air.

19
00:02:43,939 --> 00:02:46,683
Sphinx kid's telling us to
get a detective named Shibazaki.

20
00:02:47,249 --> 00:02:48,776
He won't say anything until we do.

21
00:03:05,746 --> 00:03:07,899
I'm Kurahashi, First Investigation.

22
00:03:08,146 --> 00:03:10,103
Shibazaki is currently on leave.

23
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:12,287
I'll hear what you have to say instead.

24
00:03:12,873 --> 00:03:14,480
Why did you turn yourself in?

25
00:03:15,366 --> 00:03:17,277
Why would you commit these crimes?

26
00:03:18,098 --> 00:03:20,235
You can start by telling me who you are.

27
00:03:24,876 --> 00:03:27,088
I've set a timer on the nuclear device we stole.

28
00:03:27,113 --> 00:03:27,605
Huh?

29
00:03:27,827 --> 00:03:29,372
If you wanna stop the clock,

30
00:03:29,504 --> 00:03:31,388
I suggest you agree to my demands.

31
00:03:32,536 --> 00:03:34,018
What demands?

32
00:03:45,518 --> 00:03:46,955
Hm? What's wrong?

33
00:03:47,413 --> 00:03:52,247
Huh? Oh. Nothing. I went to see Haruka.

34
00:03:52,479 --> 00:03:53,173
Really?

35
00:03:53,293 --> 00:03:56,787
You could've at least mentioned it
first. I wanted to give her a few things.

36
00:03:57,373 --> 00:04:00,439
Right. Jeez. She's so grown up.

37
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:03,993
It's funny how kids turn into
adults in the blink of an eye, y'know?

38
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,304
Something happen?

39
00:04:06,377 --> 00:04:08,084
Hm? No.

40
00:04:08,711 --> 00:04:09,537
Weirdo.

41
00:04:11,518 --> 00:04:14,135
Hey. This guy down there looks suspicious!

42
00:04:14,292 --> 00:04:14,708
What?

43
00:04:16,919 --> 00:04:18,723
You're creepin' my wife out, man.

44
00:04:19,042 --> 00:04:22,313
Just keeping an eye on you so I
can come with when you go see Mamiya.

45
00:04:23,974 --> 00:04:25,358
And if anything happens?

46
00:04:25,383 --> 00:04:27,524
Fine. I'm prepared for the worst.

47
00:04:28,378 --> 00:04:30,661
Then I have an important request to make of you.

48
00:04:30,855 --> 00:04:31,355
Sure!

49
00:04:33,052 --> 00:04:34,467
Buy me some cigarettes.

50
00:04:34,987 --> 00:04:35,527
What?

51
00:04:35,647 --> 00:04:36,880
It's a superstition.

52
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,421
When I feel like I'm about to hit on something big,

53
00:04:39,601 --> 00:04:41,225
there's a brand I always smoke.

54
00:04:41,997 --> 00:04:42,611
Right.

55
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:46,732
A press conference?

56
00:04:46,932 --> 00:04:48,455
What could he wanna talk about?

57
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:51,064
I don't know. He just said that it should be at 8 PM,

58
00:04:51,297 --> 00:04:54,103
and requested that we gather
all the different news outlets.

59
00:04:54,186 --> 00:04:55,455
If we don't hold this thing.

60
00:04:55,894 --> 00:04:58,704
I'm afraid this kid will actually set off an atomic bomb.

61
00:04:58,729 --> 00:05:01,033
So you plan to negotiate with a terrorist?

62
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:03,812
I plan to think of the safety of our citizens.

63
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,637
He said as long as we give him this,

64
00:05:06,755 --> 00:05:08,722
he'll turn the bomb over to the police.

65
00:05:08,771 --> 00:05:09,670
We can't trust 'im!

66
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:13,837
They have kept their promises in every
crime announcement they've made so far.

67
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:16,237
But this is different.

68
00:05:16,537 --> 00:05:18,467
It's the first time they're making a demand.

69
00:05:19,049 --> 00:05:19,748
And?

70
00:05:19,942 --> 00:05:22,070
If he's lying and the worst were to happen?

71
00:05:22,138 --> 00:05:24,590
I doubt it will, but, I'll be accountable.

72
00:05:44,874 --> 00:05:45,441
Yes?

73
00:05:45,594 --> 00:05:48,389
Detective Shibazaki, Metropolitan PD.

74
00:05:48,576 --> 00:05:50,324
I'd like to speak with Shunzo Mamiya.

75
00:05:51,038 --> 00:05:54,470
I'm sorry, but he's not receiving
any visitors at this time.

76
00:05:54,763 --> 00:05:57,613
Please tell him I'm here on behalf
of the children that disappeared.

77
00:05:58,135 --> 00:05:59,626
All 26 of them.

78
00:06:02,569 --> 00:06:03,603
One moment please.

79
00:06:05,966 --> 00:06:07,855
Yeah, a pack of Shinsei, please.

80
00:06:08,681 --> 00:06:09,821
Looks like we don't have 'em.

81
00:06:11,212 --> 00:06:12,880
This is the eighth place I've tried.

82
00:06:35,693 --> 00:06:38,939
You want the truth. But are you prepared to hear it?

83
00:06:39,255 --> 00:06:40,189
Damn right.

84
00:06:40,454 --> 00:06:44,364
I imagine your resolve must be
strong if it brought you here to see me.

85
00:06:45,057 --> 00:06:48,403
Yes, and after 15 long years, at that.

86
00:06:48,996 --> 00:06:50,815
I'm sure you don't remember me, but,

87
00:06:51,115 --> 00:06:54,024
I have quite the personal grudge to settle with you, too.

88
00:06:56,396 --> 00:06:57,961
You may leave us.

89
00:07:03,654 --> 00:07:05,167
I don't know the details.

90
00:07:05,273 --> 00:07:08,195
All the locals said was that
the suspect had turned himself in.

91
00:07:09,644 --> 00:07:10,405
Five!

92
00:07:12,927 --> 00:07:15,272
They've never seen a case like yours before.

93
00:07:15,297 --> 00:07:17,784
Ya need more tests, so try to take it easy.

94
00:07:19,703 --> 00:07:22,780
He's mine. I won't let anyone else have him.

95
00:07:26,594 --> 00:07:28,353
You're just a youngster.

96
00:07:29,293 --> 00:07:31,250
So, you probably can't imagine it,

97
00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:34,914
but Tokyo used to be a burnt field.

98
00:07:35,655 --> 00:07:37,772
It's been almost 70 years.

99
00:07:37,855 --> 00:07:41,039
70 years since the end of that damned war.

100
00:07:41,083 --> 00:07:45,542
However, this country remains a defeated one.

101
00:07:46,496 --> 00:07:53,575
Even now our spirit is that of a loser, no shred of
dignity left, and no pride left to stand up to anyone.

102
00:07:54,188 --> 00:07:57,756
This country must become truly independent once more.

103
00:07:58,296 --> 00:08:01,357
So that's why you implemented the Athena Plan.

104
00:08:02,059 --> 00:08:03,165
Exactly.

105
00:08:03,592 --> 00:08:09,689
To artificially create humans whose intelligence
and sensitivity surpass that of ordinary people.

106
00:08:09,884 --> 00:08:12,980
To raise personnel more useful than any weapon.

107
00:08:13,084 --> 00:08:15,888
To win, again. That was the goal.

108
00:08:17,585 --> 00:08:19,772
The plan was considered a failure.

109
00:08:20,092 --> 00:08:22,081
But if you ask my opinion,

110
00:08:22,481 --> 00:08:25,256
it became a fine foundation for the country.

111
00:08:25,989 --> 00:08:28,833
A fine foundation? What are you talking about?

112
00:08:29,253 --> 00:08:31,270
Most of those poor orphans were killed.

113
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:33,631
And two who lived are now terrorists.

114
00:08:33,858 --> 00:08:36,215
Sphinx came back to commit patricide.

115
00:08:36,428 --> 00:08:38,343
Their goal is to kill you all.

116
00:08:39,137 --> 00:08:41,373
So they took the last thing you expected,

117
00:08:41,713 --> 00:08:44,889
and the last thing you want the
rest of the world to know about.

118
00:08:50,075 --> 00:08:54,164
We need to prove that when this country's
constitutional interpretation changed,

119
00:08:54,189 --> 00:08:56,807
they started secretly producing atomic weapons.

120
00:08:56,866 --> 00:08:59,222
It's imperative we secure the target alive.

121
00:08:59,281 --> 00:09:01,090
That's the only way to get our evidence.

122
00:09:01,263 --> 00:09:02,917
Please do not forget that.

123
00:09:04,991 --> 00:09:08,037
Allow me to ask you, since you know so much.

124
00:09:08,228 --> 00:09:10,610
Do you plan to bring this to the authorities?

125
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:13,797
You realize, no matter what a single detective shouts,

126
00:09:13,834 --> 00:09:17,201
it'll be no more than a tiny voice in a storm of noise.

127
00:09:17,741 --> 00:09:19,194
It will be swallowed up.

128
00:09:19,294 --> 00:09:21,995
The voice will never reach a single soul.

129
00:09:22,749 --> 00:09:24,186
Even if you're right,

130
00:09:24,584 --> 00:09:26,590
I'll continue to shout the truth.

131
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:31,444
You won't get away with this one. None of you will.

132
00:09:34,732 --> 00:09:35,880
Excuse me, sir.

133
00:09:41,608 --> 00:09:45,046
My assistant here tells me Sphinx has surrendered.

134
00:09:47,161 --> 00:09:52,140
We have just received word that someone
identifying himself as "Sphinx" has turned himself in.

135
00:09:52,196 --> 00:09:54,666
The suspect has demanded a press conference tonight.

136
00:09:54,691 --> 00:09:58,180
He said in a deposition that he
will explain everything at 8 PM.

137
00:09:59,373 --> 00:10:00,321
Twelve!

138
00:10:03,042 --> 00:10:06,159
Sphinx surrendered! Nine turned himself in.

139
00:10:07,535 --> 00:10:08,695
I don't get it.

140
00:10:08,978 --> 00:10:14,167
Why would Nine go to the police?
Do you know? What should we do?

141
00:10:17,277 --> 00:10:20,662
I dunno. You wanna go over there?

142
00:10:43,873 --> 00:10:45,736
Come on, let's ride that!

143
00:10:48,403 --> 00:10:49,855
Kurahashi, please!

144
00:10:50,396 --> 00:10:52,948
Do this for me. All I need's a quick look!

145
00:10:52,973 --> 00:10:53,897
It's impossible.

146
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:57,922
Even within the department, only a
select few have access to the suspect.

147
00:10:57,947 --> 00:11:00,742
Can't you do something? I know
him better than anyone else!

148
00:11:00,767 --> 00:11:01,555
Shibazaki!

149
00:11:03,201 --> 00:11:04,770
I'm taking care of this.

150
00:11:08,715 --> 00:11:10,830
He specified the conference's location.

151
00:11:11,603 --> 00:11:13,531
Any idea what he wants to talk about?

152
00:11:14,397 --> 00:11:15,814
You'll likely have interference

153
00:11:15,897 --> 00:11:17,855
from different quarters.

154
00:11:17,939 --> 00:11:21,592
No matter what happens, do not let anyone else have him.

155
00:11:22,205 --> 00:11:23,147
Yeah.

156
00:11:25,907 --> 00:11:26,780
What's that?

157
00:11:26,805 --> 00:11:29,147
The location of the press conference.

158
00:11:29,721 --> 00:11:32,466
You "found" that note. Stumbled across it.

159
00:11:35,195 --> 00:11:37,122
It's a trap, no matter how you look at it!

160
00:11:37,147 --> 00:11:39,677
There's always an ulterior
motive when they turn 'emselves in.

161
00:11:39,749 --> 00:11:41,929
Besides, there are two perps. Where's the other one?

162
00:11:41,954 --> 00:11:44,642
Yeah, right? Y'guys think he'll
bomb the press conference or somethin'?

163
00:11:44,667 --> 00:11:46,346
Hey, you smokin' now?

164
00:11:46,492 --> 00:11:47,605
No, probably not.

165
00:11:48,106 --> 00:11:49,902
I bet our guys are ready for that.

166
00:11:49,927 --> 00:11:52,188
Come on, we should at least mention it, though.

167
00:11:52,322 --> 00:11:54,103
How? We're all suspended, remember?

168
00:11:54,128 --> 00:11:56,356
We walk in there and tell them before it's too late!

169
00:11:59,469 --> 00:12:00,715
Here, take 'em!

170
00:12:01,710 --> 00:12:03,670
Why the hell didn't you wait for me?

171
00:12:04,214 --> 00:12:06,125
Because you were takin' too damn long.

172
00:12:07,068 --> 00:12:09,272
You met with Mamiya, didn't you?

173
00:12:09,537 --> 00:12:10,277
Yeah.

174
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:14,115
I'm gonna follow this through
to the end, no matter the cost.

175
00:12:14,762 --> 00:12:17,072
But there's something I still need to see first.

176
00:12:18,516 --> 00:12:21,018
Their future. With my own eyes.

177
00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:28,898
I told you. Only the Japanese police
are being allowed to escort him there.

178
00:12:29,218 --> 00:12:31,564
That's the Sphinx boy's demand, not mine.

179
00:12:31,762 --> 00:12:32,772
I see.

180
00:12:32,935 --> 00:12:37,289
You comply with the demands of a terrorist,
and yet refuse the American government?

181
00:12:37,447 --> 00:12:38,830
Do I understand correctly?

182
00:12:39,129 --> 00:12:41,362
No. That's not what I'm saying.

183
00:12:41,387 --> 00:12:43,645
I certainly hope you won't disappoint us.

184
00:12:43,911 --> 00:12:46,161
You wouldn't wanna let my bosses down.

185
00:12:47,288 --> 00:12:49,057
You're wasting your time.

186
00:12:49,377 --> 00:12:51,674
If you want something, you should just take it.

187
00:12:52,224 --> 00:12:54,081
Ever since your airport stunt.

188
00:12:54,206 --> 00:12:57,002
We've been on less than good
terms with the Japanese government.

189
00:12:57,637 --> 00:12:58,519
We can't afford to interv...

190
00:12:58,544 --> 00:13:02,052
What about an attack from an
armed group of unknown affiliation?

191
00:13:02,426 --> 00:13:04,996
That wouldn't have anything whatsoever to do with us.

192
00:13:06,625 --> 00:13:09,522
Look. Isn't this cute? Here.

193
00:13:11,597 --> 00:13:12,538
Thank you.

194
00:13:13,185 --> 00:13:15,402
Nine's holding a press conference tonight.

195
00:13:17,216 --> 00:13:20,122
So, what do you think's gonna happen to him?

196
00:13:20,473 --> 00:13:23,220
Will we ever see him again?

197
00:13:24,239 --> 00:13:26,284
Eh. Doesn't matter.

198
00:13:27,751 --> 00:13:30,448
Really. S'not my concern.

199
00:13:31,042 --> 00:13:31,975
Twelve...

200
00:13:33,039 --> 00:13:35,622
I mean it. I have no right to face Nine.

201
00:13:36,604 --> 00:13:39,219
I left. Betrayed him.

202
00:13:41,598 --> 00:13:43,326
You're being so stupid!

203
00:13:43,986 --> 00:13:47,196
When I saw you there. When you came for me.

204
00:13:48,016 --> 00:13:50,951
I was so relieved, and so happy!

205
00:13:51,868 --> 00:13:57,418
I think he'll feel like... he'll feel that way, too!

206
00:14:26,955 --> 00:14:29,375
Only press designated by the police allowed.

207
00:14:29,428 --> 00:14:30,855
I am the police.

208
00:14:31,928 --> 00:14:34,207
Hey! Did you take my badge?

209
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:36,026
Shibazaki!

210
00:14:37,105 --> 00:14:37,768
Here.

211
00:15:01,346 --> 00:15:04,200
ETA is in 15 minutes, at 19:20 hours.

212
00:15:04,734 --> 00:15:05,840
Stay alert.

213
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:11,482
Trace all vehicles that've left the police
department in the past three hours and make it quick.

214
00:15:11,507 --> 00:15:12,522
All of 'em?

215
00:15:12,628 --> 00:15:13,736
Get to it!

216
00:15:13,761 --> 00:15:14,689
Yes, ma'am.

217
00:15:23,819 --> 00:15:25,236
Go, hit the gas!

218
00:15:32,263 --> 00:15:34,504
Do not let them stop us! Cut through!

219
00:15:34,529 --> 00:15:35,147
Right!

220
00:15:53,663 --> 00:15:55,357
The transport's a decoy!

221
00:15:55,382 --> 00:15:57,414
Okay, remove D-6 and E-7.

222
00:15:57,497 --> 00:15:58,627
Understood, ma'am.

223
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:00,937
This one?

224
00:16:01,922 --> 00:16:02,877
Clarence.

225
00:16:04,663 --> 00:16:06,704
All right. We'll attempt to detain it.

226
00:16:16,212 --> 00:16:17,006
Slow down!

227
00:16:17,031 --> 00:16:18,698
Oh just calm your tits.

228
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:27,458
She's here.

229
00:16:46,818 --> 00:16:47,445
Shit!

230
00:16:47,855 --> 00:16:49,230
So be it.

231
00:17:52,801 --> 00:17:55,732
You're relieved of your duties,
Five, effective immediately.

232
00:17:57,153 --> 00:17:58,705
This your idea of a joke?

233
00:17:58,947 --> 00:18:01,355
Multiple instances of insubordination,

234
00:18:01,637 --> 00:18:03,304
not to mention breakin' the law.

235
00:18:03,907 --> 00:18:06,331
Your weakened physical condition pretty much sealed it.

236
00:18:07,265 --> 00:18:12,075
It's regrettable. It really is, Five. I'm sorry.

237
00:18:13,975 --> 00:18:16,349
It's me. The situation's changed.

238
00:18:16,502 --> 00:18:18,312
Have another vehicle pursue the target.

239
00:18:25,512 --> 00:18:31,180
Idiot. What are you thinkin'?
You want to be our enemy, now?

240
00:18:34,385 --> 00:18:35,898
I was very clear.

241
00:18:36,545 --> 00:18:39,102
I'm not going to let anyone else have Nine.

242
00:19:06,524 --> 00:19:10,890
Nine. I always wanted to beat you, but I never could.

243
00:19:11,656 --> 00:19:15,076
Did you realize this was going to be my last opportunity?

244
00:19:16,944 --> 00:19:18,022
Here we are.

245
00:19:18,314 --> 00:19:20,455
Time was always going to catch up with us.

246
00:19:20,665 --> 00:19:22,551
I finally get to thank you, though.

247
00:19:24,115 --> 00:19:29,467
The only reason I was able to survive
until this point is because of you.

248
00:19:30,851 --> 00:19:35,145
Yes. All along, you are what gave me a reason to live.

249
00:19:36,807 --> 00:19:39,168
Five. I'm sorry.

250
00:19:39,754 --> 00:19:40,534
I know.

251
00:19:41,088 --> 00:19:43,973
Now's as good a time as any to part ways, don't you think?

252
00:19:45,006 --> 00:19:50,587
So. Let me help you live this time, Nine.

253
00:19:59,295 --> 00:20:04,203
Good luck, Nine. Goodbye. I'm going on ahead.

254
00:20:09,933 --> 00:20:10,770
Five!

255
00:20:18,952 --> 00:20:23,015
What the hell? Why aren't they here?

256
00:20:36,335 --> 00:20:39,386
Good evening. This is Sphinx Number One.

257
00:20:39,979 --> 00:20:44,453
Because of your interference, today's
press conference has been cancelled.

258
00:20:44,705 --> 00:20:45,872
Oh god.

259
00:20:46,013 --> 00:20:47,440
Isn't this the press conference?

260
00:20:47,465 --> 00:20:48,507
It's cancelled?

261
00:20:49,174 --> 00:20:53,022
This is an automatic broadcast set to
air if the press conference fell through.

262
00:20:53,055 --> 00:20:54,690
It will be the last message.

263
00:20:55,103 --> 00:21:00,647
That being understood, all negotiations are
off the table, and the final bomb is in place.

264
00:21:01,052 --> 00:21:05,178
It is an atomic bomb and will
detonate without fail at 10 PM.

265
00:21:05,772 --> 00:21:08,650
Unfortunately, no one can stop it now.

266
00:21:10,605 --> 00:21:15,519
So I guess that's it. People of Japan, sayonara.
