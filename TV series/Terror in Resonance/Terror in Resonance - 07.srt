1
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:07,534
The serial bombers called Sphinx have resurfaced,
once again antagonizing authorities through riddles.

2
00:00:07,587 --> 00:00:10,356
Nice! Looks like we've got an impostor.

3
00:00:10,649 --> 00:00:13,192
Guess that's one way to know we've hit the big time.

4
00:00:13,358 --> 00:00:15,667
We'll have to hope the default does the job.

5
00:00:17,022 --> 00:00:19,697
Haneda Airport, International Terminal.

6
00:00:21,984 --> 00:00:24,487
I don't think this is really from Sphinx.

7
00:00:24,769 --> 00:00:28,436
It's just that, I want to be one of you.

8
00:00:28,873 --> 00:00:30,503
Let me help your cause!

9
00:00:32,495 --> 00:00:34,155
Everything's in place.

10
00:02:24,349 --> 00:02:26,557
Pull up the "Runpass" activity log.

11
00:02:26,582 --> 00:02:27,463
Yes, ma'am.

12
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:31,248
Filter down to users active in the last 15 minutes.

13
00:02:31,273 --> 00:02:31,986
Yes, ma'am.

14
00:02:35,578 --> 00:02:39,094
You're getting careless, Nine.

15
00:02:42,774 --> 00:02:44,318
It's about time, isn't it?

16
00:02:45,759 --> 00:02:47,094
Target confirmed.

17
00:02:58,019 --> 00:02:59,314
A chessboard?

18
00:02:59,724 --> 00:03:00,975
That's crazy.

19
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,234
You think she wants to continue the game from before?

20
00:03:03,259 --> 00:03:08,957
Uh-huh. She's planning to use airport
as the board, and us as the pieces.

21
00:03:13,743 --> 00:03:18,577
And lemme guess. If we win, the position of
the last piece will match the bomb's location.

22
00:03:19,139 --> 00:03:19,975
Yeah.

23
00:03:34,067 --> 00:03:35,682
King's Knight to F-6!

24
00:03:35,707 --> 00:03:36,607
Good luck!

25
00:03:47,226 --> 00:03:50,305
It's been far too long since we last played.

26
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:51,612
Run, Nine.

27
00:04:03,392 --> 00:04:05,130
The bomb should be in here somewhere.

28
00:04:05,515 --> 00:04:06,916
I think we'll have to split up.

29
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:08,547
Hang on, so,

30
00:04:08,885 --> 00:04:11,530
we gotta figure out a way to search this entire airport?

31
00:04:11,797 --> 00:04:12,941
Just the five of us?

32
00:04:12,966 --> 00:04:14,376
Yeah, and keep in mind,

33
00:04:14,422 --> 00:04:18,435
a message will appear soon. It could show up anywhere.

34
00:04:18,841 --> 00:04:20,896
Like there! D4?

35
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:27,298
Exactly.

36
00:04:31,571 --> 00:04:33,133
I hate this airport.

37
00:04:33,158 --> 00:04:34,566
What happened to the dang map?

38
00:04:38,615 --> 00:04:40,505
Ok, here we go. It's her next move.

39
00:04:40,619 --> 00:04:42,856
All we have to do is get to the checkmate.

40
00:04:43,118 --> 00:04:44,758
That's where we should find the bomb.

41
00:04:47,529 --> 00:04:49,889
What? You got orders from the police?

42
00:04:49,914 --> 00:04:51,890
Yep. They didn't tell me why.

43
00:04:52,049 --> 00:04:55,188
I was just told to make sure
these images got on the screens.

44
00:04:55,248 --> 00:04:57,372
And you're positive it was the police?

45
00:04:57,399 --> 00:04:59,207
How did you guys not know about it?

46
00:04:59,232 --> 00:05:02,024
You should've, unless you're not really cops.

47
00:05:13,691 --> 00:05:15,143
Target B Lost.

48
00:05:15,555 --> 00:05:18,486
It's like he knows exactly where
all of the security cameras are,

49
00:05:18,511 --> 00:05:20,314
and he's hidin' in their blind spots.

50
00:05:21,066 --> 00:05:22,720
That ain't possible, is it?

51
00:05:23,062 --> 00:05:28,025
Get the footage of Target B to the airport police,
and have them start searching for him, immediately.

52
00:05:28,151 --> 00:05:29,982
Tell them this is their top priority.

53
00:05:30,007 --> 00:05:30,820
Yes, ma'am.

54
00:05:32,994 --> 00:05:36,009
The next move is NC3.

55
00:05:51,751 --> 00:05:53,957
Is she saying she's seen through everything?

56
00:05:55,415 --> 00:05:58,623
Damn it! Why would the police
order him to put up that image?

57
00:05:58,747 --> 00:06:00,249
And what does it even mean?

58
00:06:00,373 --> 00:06:01,832
It's some kinda message.

59
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:04,328
I'd guess the sender is whoever set the bomb.

60
00:06:04,457 --> 00:06:07,207
They're communicating with someone trying to disarm it.

61
00:06:07,509 --> 00:06:10,104
So, who's got the authority pull this off?

62
00:06:10,498 --> 00:06:13,223
Wait a minute. You're sayin' cops did this?

63
00:06:13,248 --> 00:06:14,943
Someone on the force planted the bomb?

64
00:06:15,123 --> 00:06:20,315
Then the riddle from earlier was just a fake
prepared by the department for the real Sphinx.

65
00:06:20,373 --> 00:06:22,520
Which means they must be here too.

66
00:06:23,682 --> 00:06:28,174
Sounds right. But I think we'll be better
off tracking the movements of the police.

67
00:06:42,048 --> 00:06:45,469
Other than the restrooms, there
are 12 blind spots on the floor.

68
00:06:47,857 --> 00:06:50,598
Nice. There's the welcoming committee.

69
00:06:51,153 --> 00:06:52,890
Target B has been located.

70
00:06:52,915 --> 00:06:54,229
Then go pick him up.

71
00:06:54,498 --> 00:06:55,203
Roger.

72
00:06:57,142 --> 00:06:58,290
Castling.

73
00:07:04,489 --> 00:07:05,738
BD3.

74
00:07:07,523 --> 00:07:08,875
Not a bad move.

75
00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:23,973
As far as that code goes,

76
00:07:23,998 --> 00:07:26,332
I think it means the location of a chess piece.

77
00:07:26,415 --> 00:07:27,597
A chess piece?

78
00:07:27,741 --> 00:07:30,769
So whoever's behind this is having a match with someone?

79
00:07:31,348 --> 00:07:35,952
Damn it! This doesn't make any
sense. What are they planning? Ideas?

80
00:07:41,332 --> 00:07:42,496
How's it goin'?

81
00:07:42,681 --> 00:07:43,640
Perfectly.

82
00:07:43,684 --> 00:07:47,482
Good! Then, I guess it's time for
us to introduce Sphinx Number Three?

83
00:07:48,746 --> 00:07:50,204
If you insist.

84
00:07:55,968 --> 00:07:57,190
Seriously?

85
00:07:57,703 --> 00:08:00,798
Yep! What you're lookin' for is
in the locker next to counter 12.

86
00:08:01,298 --> 00:08:04,362
Okay. Wait a sec, first, um.

87
00:08:04,903 --> 00:08:06,110
What, can't do it?

88
00:08:13,896 --> 00:08:16,293
No, I'm fine. I'm totally in.

89
00:08:30,488 --> 00:08:31,567
Let's see...

90
00:08:36,233 --> 00:08:36,880
Bingo!

91
00:08:48,921 --> 00:08:50,525
C'mon. Stop freaking out.

92
00:09:03,316 --> 00:09:05,177
Hey, there's a police truck here.

93
00:09:05,397 --> 00:09:07,707
That's weird. Wonder what it's doing.

94
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:08,707
Come with me!

95
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:09,569
Yessir!

96
00:09:16,207 --> 00:09:18,026
N capture, F4.

97
00:09:19,207 --> 00:09:21,332
Impressive, Nine.

98
00:09:22,457 --> 00:09:23,409
But...

99
00:09:43,748 --> 00:09:47,748
A1 equals Q. And that's checkmate.

100
00:10:06,843 --> 00:10:07,957
Whoa.

101
00:10:12,468 --> 00:10:13,331
What's that?

102
00:10:13,356 --> 00:10:16,182
Smoke detected in the building at Area 17B.

103
00:10:16,265 --> 00:10:18,395
Tell airport police to get over there now.

104
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:19,281
Yes, ma'am.

105
00:10:27,006 --> 00:10:29,469
Bring up camera 15. Give me a close-up.

106
00:10:40,662 --> 00:10:42,536
Clarence, you there?

107
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,166
All right, let's find that truck.

108
00:10:50,021 --> 00:10:52,011
Good call, but where do we start looking?

109
00:10:52,530 --> 00:10:54,864
Places where a large truck wouldn't stand out.

110
00:10:54,915 --> 00:10:56,028
Like right there!

111
00:10:56,452 --> 00:10:57,174
Got it!

112
00:11:08,525 --> 00:11:09,426
Get off.

113
00:11:16,998 --> 00:11:17,466
Tch.

114
00:11:24,639 --> 00:11:25,493
The time!

115
00:11:28,928 --> 00:11:29,832
Don't move.

116
00:11:56,690 --> 00:12:00,256
We haven't seen each other in so
long, Nine, and this is how you greet me?

117
00:12:00,281 --> 00:12:02,210
Are you trying to hurt my feelings?

118
00:12:02,598 --> 00:12:04,744
I can't believe I didn't notice it sooner.

119
00:12:05,435 --> 00:12:07,105
There you were in all your glory,

120
00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:09,191
but the whole thing was just a recording.

121
00:12:10,343 --> 00:12:15,436
You found your opportunity and switched out
the live feed with recorded surveillance footage

122
00:12:15,461 --> 00:12:18,395
from five minutes earlier. Clever trick.

123
00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:20,986
Why are you trying to get in our way?

124
00:12:21,476 --> 00:12:23,163
You ask like you don't know.

125
00:12:23,574 --> 00:12:26,526
Surely you realize I'm here to settle our score.

126
00:12:28,383 --> 00:12:31,015
And the bomb? Gate 1O6.

127
00:12:31,192 --> 00:12:34,164
It's where the checkmate is. Am I wrong?

128
00:12:36,501 --> 00:12:37,598
No, you're right.

129
00:12:37,623 --> 00:12:41,432
After changing the surveillance footage,
Twelve started heading directly for the bomb.

130
00:12:41,657 --> 00:12:43,828
But what about that plus one of yours?

131
00:12:44,473 --> 00:12:48,466
They helped camouflage you both by
causing a commotion with that little fire?

132
00:12:49,181 --> 00:12:54,832
I can't tell you how delighted I was to find out you
boys had made a friend, but, you know what that means.

133
00:12:55,338 --> 00:12:57,910
And oh, how I love a good weakness.

134
00:13:03,601 --> 00:13:05,215
Shut up and come with me.

135
00:13:07,665 --> 00:13:12,055
I have extended her a special
invitation to see the bomb in person.

136
00:13:12,643 --> 00:13:14,903
I didn't want her feeling left out.

137
00:13:19,435 --> 00:13:20,336
Don't move!

138
00:13:26,096 --> 00:13:26,585
Get him!

139
00:13:26,609 --> 00:13:28,116
No, you do what I say!

140
00:13:28,256 --> 00:13:28,703
But...

141
00:13:28,905 --> 00:13:30,557
I don't remember asking your opinion

142
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:32,395
or giving you permission to shoot.

143
00:13:33,775 --> 00:13:35,692
Can somebody get me the control room?

144
00:13:36,665 --> 00:13:38,653
Those were gunshots. Now what?

145
00:13:38,678 --> 00:13:39,806
What the hell.

146
00:13:39,831 --> 00:13:42,006
Like we don't already have enough on our plate.

147
00:13:56,709 --> 00:13:58,708
Shibazaki! What's the hold up?

148
00:14:02,431 --> 00:14:04,624
Nine! I don't think the bomb is here!

149
00:14:04,649 --> 00:14:05,191
What?

150
00:14:05,281 --> 00:14:06,128
I don't get it.

151
00:14:06,269 --> 00:14:08,369
This was supposed to be the checkmate spot!

152
00:14:11,457 --> 00:14:14,365
I can't get out! Please, you have to help me!

153
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:16,598
I'm on a plane and it's moving.

154
00:14:16,766 --> 00:14:18,715
What? Why are you on a plane?

155
00:14:19,084 --> 00:14:21,182
This guy just showed up and grabbed me,

156
00:14:21,207 --> 00:14:24,462
and then forced me to get on. The bomb is in here, too.

157
00:14:26,719 --> 00:14:28,509
Tell me what to do!

158
00:14:28,897 --> 00:14:31,815
Hey. Wasn't that plane headed for the hangar?

159
00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:34,928
Jus' stay calm, 'kay?

160
00:14:35,267 --> 00:14:37,212
First of all, who's piloting that thing?

161
00:14:37,807 --> 00:14:40,022
Um. There's no one in there.

162
00:14:40,405 --> 00:14:42,177
It's moving by itself!

163
00:14:43,665 --> 00:14:44,827
Of course.

164
00:14:45,346 --> 00:14:48,241
That's why you couldn't find
the bomb at the gate we thought.

165
00:14:54,274 --> 00:14:56,475
Because they put it on a plane instead.

166
00:14:57,859 --> 00:15:01,329
Yeah. Now, that bomb is on the move,

167
00:15:01,916 --> 00:15:04,357
and I bet it's headed right this way.

168
00:15:05,669 --> 00:15:08,035
Gate 1O6, where we're standing.

169
00:15:11,998 --> 00:15:14,138
Damn it. What is her problem?

170
00:15:14,564 --> 00:15:16,481
She's settling old scores.

171
00:15:16,948 --> 00:15:19,141
Okay, it's clearly being driven remotely.

172
00:15:19,501 --> 00:15:23,483
Which means we should have a
pretty good idea where she is.

173
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:24,795
In the control tower!

174
00:15:26,267 --> 00:15:28,589
Here we are, Nine: the final stage.

175
00:15:29,336 --> 00:15:31,446
Can you clear it, though?

176
00:15:31,886 --> 00:15:32,920
What do we do?

177
00:15:33,021 --> 00:15:35,887
The tower is crawling with armed special assault forces.

178
00:15:35,912 --> 00:15:37,270
We can't get anywhere near it.

179
00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:42,640
We have to create some kind of commotion.

180
00:15:42,914 --> 00:15:45,189
The general public needs to be evacuated.

181
00:15:46,128 --> 00:15:47,608
Wait, what're you saying?

182
00:15:48,642 --> 00:15:50,498
You know what'll happen to Lisa.

183
00:15:51,124 --> 00:15:53,135
She's trapped in there with the bomb!

184
00:15:54,539 --> 00:15:55,333
I know.

185
00:16:02,864 --> 00:16:05,245
There is one way, but it's risky.

186
00:16:15,618 --> 00:16:16,953
Detective Shibazaki?

187
00:16:18,076 --> 00:16:18,932
Who's this?

188
00:16:19,149 --> 00:16:20,576
Sphinx Number One.

189
00:16:23,242 --> 00:16:25,381
What the hell? How do you have this number?

190
00:16:25,406 --> 00:16:26,593
No time to explain.

191
00:16:26,832 --> 00:16:29,065
The bomb you're looking for's not one of ours.

192
00:16:29,431 --> 00:16:32,332
I'm sure you already have an idea of who'd wanna frame us.

193
00:16:32,583 --> 00:16:34,298
But right now I need your help.

194
00:16:34,842 --> 00:16:35,752
You do?

195
00:16:36,473 --> 00:16:40,707
At the moment, there's a passenger jet
with a bomb on it heading toward Gate 1O6.

196
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:42,927
I have every reason to believe it's real.

197
00:16:43,709 --> 00:16:45,555
There's only one way to stop it.

198
00:16:46,031 --> 00:16:49,497
You have to get into the control
room and take over the autopilot system.

199
00:16:50,098 --> 00:16:53,547
It has to be you because the special
assault team is swarming that area.

200
00:16:53,572 --> 00:16:55,282
No way we can get near it.

201
00:16:55,832 --> 00:16:59,338
Seriously. You're asking for help from the police?

202
00:16:59,684 --> 00:17:03,970
The way I see it, if that bomb goes
off, it becomes a problem for both of us.

203
00:17:05,107 --> 00:17:07,615
So you're saying we have mutual interests.

204
00:17:08,704 --> 00:17:11,579
Well yeah. Isn't that kinda your job?

205
00:17:11,604 --> 00:17:13,271
To protect and serve?

206
00:17:14,814 --> 00:17:16,981
Ha. Funny guy.

207
00:17:17,165 --> 00:17:19,845
Not a line I'd expect to hear from a terrorist.

208
00:17:24,274 --> 00:17:25,746
Five minutes left.

209
00:17:33,024 --> 00:17:34,568
Lisa, can you hear me?

210
00:17:35,391 --> 00:17:37,707
You were told not to let anyone through, rookie!

211
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,432
Yeah, but these guys say they're detectives.

212
00:17:39,457 --> 00:17:41,672
This is an emergency. Get out of our way!

213
00:17:41,697 --> 00:17:42,973
We have orders, sir!

214
00:17:42,998 --> 00:17:44,587
Hey, we're all cops here!

215
00:17:44,623 --> 00:17:46,623
And we got business in the control room!

216
00:17:46,649 --> 00:17:47,665
Back off, man!

217
00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:48,382
There's no time!

218
00:17:48,832 --> 00:17:49,642
Get back!

219
00:17:49,667 --> 00:17:51,959
Will you just listen to me!

220
00:17:52,373 --> 00:17:54,265
Ya just have to do what I told you.

221
00:17:54,329 --> 00:17:57,223
You'll be fine. Stay calm and breathe.

222
00:17:57,854 --> 00:17:59,403
I know you can do this.

223
00:18:02,724 --> 00:18:04,265
Shibazaki, run!

224
00:18:04,290 --> 00:18:06,192
We're on the same team!

225
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:08,197
Hey, wait!

226
00:18:09,011 --> 00:18:10,131
Let go!

227
00:18:25,669 --> 00:18:26,795
Lisa!

228
00:18:28,123 --> 00:18:30,867
Oh, thank God. Okay.

229
00:18:38,861 --> 00:18:39,734
Damn it!

230
00:18:41,903 --> 00:18:42,867
No!

231
00:18:55,609 --> 00:18:56,505
Hold it.

232
00:18:58,896 --> 00:19:00,957
You'll be taking orders from me, now.

233
00:19:01,093 --> 00:19:01,833
Tch!

234
00:19:12,019 --> 00:19:12,838
I'm stuck.

235
00:19:15,707 --> 00:19:17,587
Outta time! Hurry!

236
00:19:21,268 --> 00:19:23,315
You realize you're just his pet dog.

237
00:19:23,424 --> 00:19:25,275
I can't believe you're trusting him!

238
00:19:26,707 --> 00:19:27,458
Here!

239
00:19:30,072 --> 00:19:32,166
C'mon! You're not done yet.

240
00:19:50,082 --> 00:19:52,290
I will make you regret this.

241
00:20:40,829 --> 00:20:41,616
It's locked!

242
00:20:41,853 --> 00:20:42,895
No, wait!

243
00:20:53,082 --> 00:20:54,801
Damn you, Sphinx.

244
00:21:11,299 --> 00:21:14,199
Lisa, you won't get away again.
