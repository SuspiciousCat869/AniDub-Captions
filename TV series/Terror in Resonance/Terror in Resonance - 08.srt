1
00:00:01,670 --> 00:00:03,941
Because they put it on a plane instead.

2
00:00:03,966 --> 00:00:06,485
I can't get out! Please, you have to help me!

3
00:00:06,525 --> 00:00:07,407
Hold it.

4
00:00:07,539 --> 00:00:09,607
You'll be taking orders from me, now.

5
00:00:11,926 --> 00:00:12,646
Here!

6
00:00:21,512 --> 00:00:22,904
Damn you, Sphinx.

7
00:00:23,903 --> 00:00:26,945
Lisa, you won't get away again.

8
00:03:03,926 --> 00:03:07,679
We have some new information regarding
the bombing incident at Haneda Airport.

9
00:03:07,704 --> 00:03:12,093
The explosion occured on an unoccupied
runway, fortunately resulting in no injuries.

10
00:03:12,565 --> 00:03:18,528
Based on suspicious text messages, the attack is
suspected to be connected to the terrorist cell, Sphinx.

11
00:03:20,511 --> 00:03:22,325
"We're supposed to stay here."

12
00:03:22,795 --> 00:03:24,720
It's called direct order, gentlemen.

13
00:03:25,593 --> 00:03:29,140
In spite of that, you lot somehow
got into a fight at the airport,

14
00:03:29,307 --> 00:03:32,746
and even managed to significantly
interfere with the investigation.

15
00:03:34,841 --> 00:03:35,907
Was it worth it?

16
00:03:35,932 --> 00:03:37,758
Because you're all now suspended.

17
00:03:38,063 --> 00:03:40,650
You're off the case. I don't
want to see you for three months.

18
00:03:40,676 --> 00:03:41,504
Three months?

19
00:03:41,529 --> 00:03:44,562
If you even piss without orders
again, you'll be out permanently.

20
00:03:46,671 --> 00:03:47,946
We clear on this?

21
00:03:48,655 --> 00:03:50,918
Won't be terribly easy to find another job.

22
00:03:51,456 --> 00:03:54,664
Don't punish them. The whole thing was my idea, sir.

23
00:03:55,021 --> 00:03:57,403
And I'm prepared to take full responsibility.

24
00:03:57,728 --> 00:03:59,645
Oh, I don't need you to tell me that.

25
00:04:00,013 --> 00:04:01,935
You are getting special treatment.

26
00:04:02,333 --> 00:04:06,858
Mister Shibazaki, at this point
you are suspended indefinitely.

27
00:04:07,494 --> 00:04:08,660
Indefinite?

28
00:04:08,685 --> 00:04:10,477
So basically you're saying he's fired?

29
00:04:11,029 --> 00:04:13,989
Look, you need to know I saw Sphinx with my own eyes.

30
00:04:14,372 --> 00:04:16,384
They're not guilty of that bombing.

31
00:04:17,426 --> 00:04:20,309
Whoever set up the whole airport
thing was just trying to frame them.

32
00:04:20,334 --> 00:04:23,000
Don't dig yourself any deeper than you already have.

33
00:04:26,427 --> 00:04:30,056
Shibazaki. Leave your badge.

34
00:04:32,559 --> 00:04:33,093
Tch!

35
00:04:37,276 --> 00:04:39,935
I get what you're tryin' to say. I do.

36
00:04:40,176 --> 00:04:42,736
But you have to understand you still got off easy.

37
00:04:43,551 --> 00:04:45,451
That girl was behind this, right?

38
00:04:45,643 --> 00:04:46,893
Pretty much, yeah.

39
00:04:46,918 --> 00:04:48,915
Seemed she was the only one who wanted you out.

40
00:04:49,355 --> 00:04:51,934
You said she was a nuclear physicist or somethin'?

41
00:04:52,161 --> 00:04:54,433
Nice story, but what is she really?

42
00:04:54,601 --> 00:04:57,184
I actually put out a few feelers about that,

43
00:04:57,301 --> 00:05:00,360
and looks like she was transferred from the ISA.

44
00:05:00,385 --> 00:05:02,115
Intelligence Support Activity?

45
00:05:02,386 --> 00:05:05,207
So this chick came from US Army Special Ops?

46
00:05:05,776 --> 00:05:06,522
You got it.

47
00:05:07,803 --> 00:05:10,011
Why are we working with a former spy?

48
00:05:10,036 --> 00:05:12,349
And why do they care about our stolen plutonium?

49
00:05:13,211 --> 00:05:16,006
Because the situation may be much worse

50
00:05:16,031 --> 00:05:17,695
than we could ever have assumed.

51
00:05:32,562 --> 00:05:33,735
Okay, what's wrong?

52
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,274
Why are you visiting out of the blue?

53
00:05:35,399 --> 00:05:37,664
What? Oh, you know.

54
00:05:38,167 --> 00:05:39,459
How's Mom doing?

55
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:42,078
Dunno. Fine and at home, I guess.

56
00:05:42,103 --> 00:05:43,223
Wow, Dad.

57
00:05:43,758 --> 00:05:47,330
I take it you're too obsessed with work
to notice her or some cliché like that?

58
00:05:48,792 --> 00:05:52,500
So I'm payin' for you to study somethin'
along the lines of physics at this school.

59
00:05:52,864 --> 00:05:55,182
I'm in the department of science and engineering.

60
00:05:55,718 --> 00:05:58,523
Then you should know about
nuclear power stuff, too, right?

61
00:05:58,676 --> 00:06:02,099
Come on. Are you worried I'm
not studying hard enough, or what?

62
00:06:02,484 --> 00:06:05,443
No, no, I just have a couple o' questions for ya is all.

63
00:06:05,499 --> 00:06:07,443
Like how plutonium's used to make a bomb.

64
00:06:07,468 --> 00:06:10,135
For real? Don't tell me this is for an investigation?

65
00:06:10,171 --> 00:06:12,445
Oh. No.

66
00:06:13,076 --> 00:06:14,868
You can't smoke in here, Dad.

67
00:06:17,999 --> 00:06:20,680
It's a precision machine, so the right tools

68
00:06:20,705 --> 00:06:21,820
would be necessary.

69
00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:24,943
Can't imagine it'd be easy for
amateurs to pull off, though.

70
00:06:24,968 --> 00:06:27,419
But in theory, it's possible. That's what worries me.

71
00:06:28,006 --> 00:06:30,587
Yeah, but there's more to it than just building the thing.

72
00:06:30,936 --> 00:06:34,561
Whoever's handling the material
would be exposed to serious radiation.

73
00:06:37,551 --> 00:06:39,930
Your investigation must be pretty serious.

74
00:06:40,015 --> 00:06:42,352
'Cause that's a heck of a look on your face.

75
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:43,605
Oh, no.

76
00:06:44,119 --> 00:06:46,526
I was just thinkin' how weak your barley tea is.

77
00:06:53,453 --> 00:06:55,794
Now to let the curry simmer for a bit...

78
00:07:03,323 --> 00:07:06,196
You Lisa Mishima? There's a package for you.

79
00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:08,162
Really, for me?

80
00:07:10,305 --> 00:07:10,956
Thank you!

81
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:16,652
Who coulda sent it?

82
00:07:27,592 --> 00:07:29,445
Wha... Bomb?

83
00:07:32,937 --> 00:07:35,367
So we're gonna move out of the hideout?

84
00:07:35,517 --> 00:07:36,995
She's been seen, now.

85
00:07:37,038 --> 00:07:37,956
We have to.

86
00:07:38,803 --> 00:07:40,099
They can't find us.

87
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:41,419
We're too close to risk it.

88
00:07:41,771 --> 00:07:45,155
I really liked that roof. Man, this totally sucks.

89
00:08:07,591 --> 00:08:10,579
Even for just a threat, this was too far.

90
00:08:11,513 --> 00:08:13,221
You know our government's orders.

91
00:08:13,364 --> 00:08:15,764
Securin' the object is our top priority.

92
00:08:15,926 --> 00:08:17,593
If the worst were to have happened today...

93
00:08:17,623 --> 00:08:20,498
Nine would never hide it in his own apartment, please.

94
00:08:22,046 --> 00:08:24,260
In the end, all they want are results, right?

95
00:08:26,728 --> 00:08:29,933
My point is you need to show some restraint.

96
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:34,277
Ya need to realize there's only so much
I can do to hold off the local police.

97
00:08:52,376 --> 00:08:53,957
This isn't funny anymore.

98
00:08:55,638 --> 00:08:57,807
I've actually never found this funny.

99
00:09:05,812 --> 00:09:08,258
I didn't think we'd end up using this spot.

100
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:11,106
Cool! We can play all the games we want in here.

101
00:09:11,566 --> 00:09:13,398
They're all super retro, but still.

102
00:09:14,227 --> 00:09:16,974
You know whose fault this is, don't you?

103
00:09:20,986 --> 00:09:22,021
It's mine.

104
00:09:26,521 --> 00:09:27,899
And I'm sorry.

105
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:53,537
The top officials at all the buildings
where bombs have been placed took part

106
00:09:53,562 --> 00:09:57,326
in a seminar led by a group
called the Rising Peace Academy.

107
00:09:58,213 --> 00:10:02,356
They had previously implemented
something called the Athena Plan.

108
00:10:03,835 --> 00:10:05,917
Athena, the goddess of wisdom,

109
00:10:06,029 --> 00:10:09,309
appears in Greek mythology. Just like the Sphinx.

110
00:10:15,713 --> 00:10:18,004
Hello? Oh, Shibazaki!

111
00:10:18,107 --> 00:10:18,776
Hey.

112
00:10:19,318 --> 00:10:22,593
I thought I had heard that you were
gonna be out of the office for a while.

113
00:10:22,618 --> 00:10:24,035
Stopped by to say hi,

114
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:25,736
and figured I could look somethin' up.

115
00:10:27,219 --> 00:10:29,442
You want one? It's a chocolate.

116
00:10:29,624 --> 00:10:30,082
Hm?

117
00:10:30,386 --> 00:10:32,712
I also got some of those pink ones you like.

118
00:10:32,984 --> 00:10:35,529
If that's your idea of a farewell gift, keep it.

119
00:10:35,652 --> 00:10:39,336
Hey, wasn't there a recent thing where the
son of some bigwig in the Ministry of Health,

120
00:10:39,361 --> 00:10:41,151
Labour and Welfare injured someone?

121
00:10:41,176 --> 00:10:43,431
Yeah. Heard about that.

122
00:10:43,456 --> 00:10:45,351
I think they settled the case out of court.

123
00:10:45,376 --> 00:10:47,683
Hate to ask, but think you can find the paperwork?

124
00:10:47,974 --> 00:10:49,203
Oh, and uh...

125
00:10:50,146 --> 00:10:51,387
"Oh, and uh" what?

126
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:54,363
You better save me one of those Pon de Rings.

127
00:10:57,512 --> 00:11:00,412
Whoa. You seriously wanna go there already?

128
00:11:01,001 --> 00:11:03,494
We didn't take Five into consideration before.

129
00:11:03,729 --> 00:11:05,875
Accelerating the plan's our only choice.

130
00:11:06,722 --> 00:11:07,804
I guess so.

131
00:11:10,519 --> 00:11:11,025
But?

132
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:15,964
Nothin'. Except. Well...

133
00:11:17,971 --> 00:11:21,735
I was just thinking, maybe we should
stop this whole thing altogether.

134
00:11:25,736 --> 00:11:27,005
I'm hungry.

135
00:11:27,042 --> 00:11:28,907
I gave you a snack five minutes ago.

136
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:30,842
Let's get straight to the point.

137
00:11:31,646 --> 00:11:36,007
About ten years ago, there was a
project created called the Athena Plan.

138
00:11:36,227 --> 00:11:39,228
Their "goal" was to properly educate gifted children.

139
00:11:39,894 --> 00:11:44,017
However, the specifics of the project
cannot be found anywhere on the public record.

140
00:11:44,777 --> 00:11:49,329
But I do know members of the Rising
Peace Academy spearheaded the project.

141
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:51,449
And since you were one of those members.

142
00:11:51,675 --> 00:11:54,123
I'm assuming you must have known about this plan?

143
00:11:54,881 --> 00:11:58,589
I'm very sorry, but I don't
know what you're talking about.

144
00:11:58,949 --> 00:12:04,485
Although, even if I did, I certainly wouldn't be
able to divulge classified information regarding it.

145
00:12:05,135 --> 00:12:08,002
I'm assuming a detective must have known that, though.

146
00:12:08,385 --> 00:12:10,001
How's that son o' yours?

147
00:12:10,108 --> 00:12:11,494
Behaving any better?

148
00:12:12,857 --> 00:12:14,684
Now, why would you bring that up?

149
00:12:14,782 --> 00:12:16,419
It has already been resolved.

150
00:12:16,444 --> 00:12:18,319
Yes, and I'm sure you're relieved.

151
00:12:18,716 --> 00:12:20,933
But it seems he didn't quite learn his lesson.

152
00:12:24,527 --> 00:12:28,044
You bastard. A detective using extortion?

153
00:12:28,461 --> 00:12:31,333
How dare you? You should know your place.

154
00:12:31,679 --> 00:12:34,543
Funny how one can change when they're about to be fired.

155
00:12:35,122 --> 00:12:38,166
Turns out I don't give a damn about "my place."

156
00:12:45,524 --> 00:12:46,767
How can you quit?

157
00:12:46,921 --> 00:12:48,434
Because if we keep this up,

158
00:12:48,607 --> 00:12:50,022
there's every chance we'll...

159
00:12:50,699 --> 00:12:51,656
Are you scared?

160
00:12:54,067 --> 00:12:55,070
Is it Lisa?

161
00:12:56,867 --> 00:12:59,170
Twelve. Think back.

162
00:12:59,801 --> 00:13:01,561
Remember where we came from.

163
00:13:11,093 --> 00:13:13,167
We're only doing what we have to, here.

164
00:13:13,982 --> 00:13:17,003
Or have... have you changed your mind?

165
00:13:18,694 --> 00:13:21,575
I get it, I do. That bomb almost killed her.

166
00:13:22,196 --> 00:13:24,700
Okay. We'll stop involving Lisa, then.

167
00:13:26,381 --> 00:13:27,939
Yeah, that's a good idea.

168
00:13:29,965 --> 00:13:32,397
But I'm afraid it still won't keep her safe.

169
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:41,305
Thought I'd help you investigate today.

170
00:13:41,893 --> 00:13:42,889
How'd you find me?

171
00:13:43,442 --> 00:13:44,639
It wasn't very hard.

172
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:46,728
Just had to bribe someone with some ramen.

173
00:13:47,266 --> 00:13:50,511
You'll be fired if you disobey
orders again, or did you forget?

174
00:13:50,743 --> 00:13:53,015
Got a job lined up if you lose this one?

175
00:13:53,471 --> 00:13:56,713
Folks own a grocery store.
Always got that to fall back on.

176
00:14:00,326 --> 00:14:01,572
Orphanages?

177
00:14:01,756 --> 00:14:02,432
Yeah.

178
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:07,524
According to that politician, they tested the
children at all the orphanages in the country,

179
00:14:07,627 --> 00:14:10,551
then gathered up the ones they
considered the most "gifted".

180
00:14:10,576 --> 00:14:13,046
So what, you're gonna check 'em all out?

181
00:14:13,194 --> 00:14:14,110
One by one?

182
00:14:14,173 --> 00:14:15,073
Yeah.

183
00:14:15,532 --> 00:14:18,036
Probably ought to act like a detective at some point.

184
00:14:22,746 --> 00:14:25,340
Yes, I believe there was a test like that.

185
00:14:25,999 --> 00:14:30,277
Far as I recall, though, no children
from our institution passed it.

186
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:34,638
Well, I was only five.

187
00:14:34,944 --> 00:14:37,368
So I don't remember what was on the test.

188
00:14:37,968 --> 00:14:39,994
But I do remember being interviewed.

189
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:41,222
What's that?

190
00:14:42,144 --> 00:14:45,079
Oh. I love those Sphinx guys. They're legit.

191
00:14:49,057 --> 00:14:53,299
Okay, so afterwards, the boy
was taken by a government official?

192
00:14:53,403 --> 00:14:56,685
That's right, and we never heard from him again.

193
00:14:56,802 --> 00:15:00,226
By chance, do you happen to
remember anything about that official?

194
00:15:00,826 --> 00:15:04,071
Sorry, but I think he gave me a business card.

195
00:15:06,745 --> 00:15:08,483
This is definitely weird.

196
00:15:08,508 --> 00:15:13,187
All of these places and not one person we
talked to has a clue where those kids ended up.

197
00:15:13,758 --> 00:15:14,728
Yeah.

198
00:15:14,771 --> 00:15:16,813
Almost like they're ghosts or something.

199
00:15:17,042 --> 00:15:18,536
They just disappeared.

200
00:15:19,267 --> 00:15:23,362
But at least we've got this
guy, and we know he's no ghost.

201
00:15:37,138 --> 00:15:38,357
The Athena Plan?

202
00:15:39,010 --> 00:15:41,903
Right. Get me whatever you can about the project.

203
00:15:42,048 --> 00:15:44,214
Check the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare.

204
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:46,362
Look into their past employees, too.

205
00:15:46,722 --> 00:15:49,500
You should be able to find this Aoki guy's address there.

206
00:15:50,265 --> 00:15:53,604
If I'm caught, I won't get off with just being fired.

207
00:15:53,848 --> 00:15:56,783
Isn't hacking the cybercrime division's specialty?

208
00:15:56,926 --> 00:15:59,058
No you ass, we try to prevent it.

209
00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:03,135
To be clear, if we don't figure
this out a lot of people are gonna die.

210
00:16:03,211 --> 00:16:03,907
Mm-hm.

211
00:16:05,552 --> 00:16:07,876
Ooh! I can feel it moving!

212
00:16:07,901 --> 00:16:10,421
Gimme a bit. I'll call you back later.

213
00:16:50,053 --> 00:16:51,273
Hey, Hamura.

214
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:54,097
That young guy we talked to who's a "fan" of Sphinx.

215
00:16:54,161 --> 00:16:55,286
You know what's happening there?

216
00:16:55,311 --> 00:16:59,249
Oh yeah. Seems a lot of kids are
startin' to treat them like heroes.

217
00:16:59,304 --> 00:17:01,304
Course, they conveniently forget the truth.

218
00:17:01,395 --> 00:17:03,079
You know, that they're just criminals.

219
00:17:03,795 --> 00:17:04,836
Interesting.

220
00:17:05,212 --> 00:17:07,901
Years ago, when I was young like them,

221
00:17:08,254 --> 00:17:11,163
there were these teens who threw rocks at cops.

222
00:17:11,446 --> 00:17:12,609
Fought against the government.

223
00:17:13,723 --> 00:17:15,797
Sphinx may be called terrorists, now,

224
00:17:16,593 --> 00:17:17,908
but in a different time.

225
00:17:18,277 --> 00:17:20,940
These boys might've been thought of as somethin' else.

226
00:17:21,692 --> 00:17:23,139
Just my opinion.

227
00:17:38,673 --> 00:17:40,754
Yes, I've found Aoki's address.

228
00:17:41,635 --> 00:17:44,493
Also. I've got some goods on the Athena Plan.

229
00:17:44,968 --> 00:17:49,842
Pharmaceutical companies, neuroscience researchers,
and medical organizations were involved, too.

230
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:51,022
No kiddin'?

231
00:17:51,169 --> 00:17:53,823
The plan itself was terminated 7 years ago.

232
00:17:54,801 --> 00:17:55,552
I see.

233
00:17:55,976 --> 00:17:59,357
Oh, and, there's one more important detail.

234
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:03,332
Of course.

235
00:18:12,730 --> 00:18:13,835
Poor thing.

236
00:18:13,938 --> 00:18:17,546
You should take better care of your
nails or they'll get weak and break.

237
00:18:18,276 --> 00:18:19,651
Lisa Mishima.

238
00:18:19,713 --> 00:18:23,401
Supposedly living with her
caring mother, just the two of them.

239
00:18:23,579 --> 00:18:25,627
I researched everything about you, Lisa.

240
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:28,605
I even know you've run away
from the guys because you think,

241
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:31,610
rightfully so, that it would be better for them that way.

242
00:18:32,885 --> 00:18:37,495
You didn't want to distract them any
more than you already have. Isn't that right?

243
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:40,275
You're just so sweet.

244
00:18:40,353 --> 00:18:43,737
Please, understand. I actually want to help them, too.

245
00:18:44,931 --> 00:18:45,497
Huh?

246
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:49,642
They still have a chance to atone for their crimes.

247
00:18:50,328 --> 00:18:53,530
However, if they carry out the next part of their plan,

248
00:18:53,734 --> 00:18:55,940
they will be tragically beyond redemption.

249
00:18:59,344 --> 00:19:00,678
You can still help.

250
00:19:00,841 --> 00:19:02,633
Tell me what you know and save them.

251
00:19:02,961 --> 00:19:05,058
Why were you even with Nine and Twelve?

252
00:19:09,885 --> 00:19:11,147
By accident.

253
00:19:11,499 --> 00:19:14,497
I saw them at the Tokyo government office building.

254
00:19:14,963 --> 00:19:20,040
They told me I had to choose between
becoming an accomplice and dying, so...

255
00:19:23,390 --> 00:19:25,192
You should've chosen to die.

256
00:19:25,845 --> 00:19:29,239
That was stupid. Unbelievably stupid.

257
00:19:29,831 --> 00:19:32,372
To have an idiot girl following them around.

258
00:19:32,636 --> 00:19:35,658
I can't imagine how annoying that must have been for them.

259
00:19:39,213 --> 00:19:42,575
I don't... I don't care what happens to me.

260
00:19:42,805 --> 00:19:44,914
But please, please let them go.

261
00:19:44,946 --> 00:19:46,154
Why would I do that?

262
00:19:46,926 --> 00:19:50,036
Surprise sweetie, I don't care
what happens to you, either.

263
00:19:50,539 --> 00:19:51,569
You are nothing.

264
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:53,841
I care more about a roach than you.

265
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:55,851
Back to the point.

266
00:19:55,933 --> 00:19:59,006
You don't honestly think those boys have a future, do you?

267
00:20:03,225 --> 00:20:04,331
Where are you going?

268
00:20:06,715 --> 00:20:09,252
I'm gonna find Lisa. I'll be back.

269
00:20:09,535 --> 00:20:10,805
Is that a good idea?

270
00:20:11,218 --> 00:20:12,926
What if she's ratting us out to the cops.

271
00:20:12,951 --> 00:20:13,986
She would never!

272
00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:16,300
And that's not just what you want to think?

273
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:21,969
It's from Lisa's phone.

274
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:26,160
Lisa!

275
00:20:26,513 --> 00:20:28,682
From Five. There's no doubt.

276
00:20:29,339 --> 00:20:31,176
Twelve. Wait!

277
00:20:33,337 --> 00:20:34,472
This is a trap.

278
00:20:35,491 --> 00:20:36,658
I know it is.

279
00:20:36,683 --> 00:20:39,977
Then why go? We can't afford to take chances.

280
00:20:40,088 --> 00:20:41,129
We're running out of time!

281
00:20:41,154 --> 00:20:42,044
I know that, too!

282
00:20:42,864 --> 00:20:43,838
Don't you see?

283
00:20:45,103 --> 00:20:47,069
I'm going because I'm out of time.

284
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:48,963
Twelve...

285
00:20:51,749 --> 00:20:53,110
Don't do this.

286
00:20:56,992 --> 00:20:58,447
I'm sorry, Nine.
