1
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:02,610
I was just thinking, maybe we should

2
00:00:02,906 --> 00:00:05,192
stop this whole thing altogether.

3
00:00:05,712 --> 00:00:09,276
To be clear, if we don't figure
this out a lot of people are gonna die.

4
00:00:09,301 --> 00:00:11,250
I don't care what happens to me...

5
00:00:11,275 --> 00:00:14,210
Surprise sweetie, I don't care
what happens to you, either.

6
00:00:14,235 --> 00:00:15,309
Back to the point.

7
00:00:15,334 --> 00:00:18,436
You don't honestly think those boys have a future, do you?

8
00:00:19,362 --> 00:00:20,142
Lisa!

9
00:00:20,235 --> 00:00:23,122
We can't afford to take chances.
We're running out of time!

10
00:00:23,147 --> 00:00:24,141
I know that, too!

11
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:26,782
I'm going because I'm out of time.

12
00:02:49,024 --> 00:02:52,077
I'll make the old man spill everything he knows.

13
00:03:02,688 --> 00:03:05,209
I'm Detective Shibazaki, Metro P.D.

14
00:03:07,713 --> 00:03:10,263
Might we have a few minutes of your time, please?

15
00:03:13,171 --> 00:03:15,825
Oh. Yeah, um.

16
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:17,838
Right this way.

17
00:03:55,894 --> 00:03:58,093
Haven't used this tea set in a while.

18
00:03:58,166 --> 00:04:01,340
When you get to be my age,
visitors are few and far between.

19
00:04:01,421 --> 00:04:05,081
Especially now, ever since my dear wife passed away.

20
00:04:07,842 --> 00:04:12,463
I'm not surprised. Always knew someone
like you would come for answers one day.

21
00:04:12,822 --> 00:04:14,757
Well, get on with it.

22
00:04:15,513 --> 00:04:17,263
I'll get straight to the point, then.

23
00:04:17,565 --> 00:04:19,868
Tell me what you know about the Athena Plan.

24
00:04:25,819 --> 00:04:30,822
Your organization gave an intelligence test to
all orphans in the country under the age of five.

25
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:34,855
You gathered the top performers, and
erased all traces of them from the record.

26
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,237
Or am I mistaken?

27
00:04:41,673 --> 00:04:44,854
Have you ever heard the name Shigeru Yamamoto before?

28
00:04:44,963 --> 00:04:47,593
The former under-secretary for Health and Welfare?

29
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:49,991
Yeah, he passed away about three years ago.

30
00:04:50,504 --> 00:04:51,526
That's correct.

31
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:56,624
He died unexpectedly right before he could report
the truth about what happened to the authorities.

32
00:04:58,379 --> 00:05:04,126
If you'd still like to be able to walk the streets
safely at night, it would be prudent to go home now.

33
00:05:06,629 --> 00:05:09,074
Hamura, you should do as he says.

34
00:05:09,101 --> 00:05:10,313
What, are you crazy?

35
00:05:10,338 --> 00:05:13,168
After all this, there's no way I'm wussin' out now!

36
00:05:28,588 --> 00:05:31,722
Are you familiar with savant syndrome, detectives?

37
00:05:31,939 --> 00:05:32,909
I think so.

38
00:05:33,024 --> 00:05:35,563
Isn't that where someone has
extremely high brain function,

39
00:05:35,588 --> 00:05:38,238
but only in specific areas due to injury or autism.

40
00:05:38,878 --> 00:05:41,828
Savants are known to excel in mental arithmetic,

41
00:05:41,853 --> 00:05:46,830
memorization, music, as well as
art and spatial skills, to name a few.

42
00:05:47,088 --> 00:05:51,703
Although these abilities far exceed an
average person's in very specific areas,

43
00:05:51,809 --> 00:05:57,582
many are unable to reliably complete mundane
tasks, or even communicate with the outside world.

44
00:05:57,796 --> 00:06:02,291
To artificially reproduce the exceptional
abilities found in these savants,

45
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:05,901
but without the deficits commonly
associated with the syndrome.

46
00:06:06,713 --> 00:06:10,393
That was the goal that lead to
the creation of the Athena Plan.

47
00:06:11,004 --> 00:06:14,504
Under government directive, 26
children total were collected.

48
00:06:14,852 --> 00:06:17,593
They were processed and became test subjects.

49
00:06:17,618 --> 00:06:18,918
Test subjects?

50
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:21,279
How is that kinda thing even possible?

51
00:06:22,546 --> 00:06:26,957
The theory behind the whole experiment was
based on a new drug accidentally developed

52
00:06:26,982 --> 00:06:30,104
in the mid-90s by a Japanese pharmaceutical company.

53
00:06:30,499 --> 00:06:33,482
They stumbled across it while researching brain function.

54
00:06:34,296 --> 00:06:38,007
The Rising Peace Academy saw
the results of the drug research.

55
00:06:38,273 --> 00:06:41,694
Then, they pulled the strings
to set the Athena Plan in motion.

56
00:06:42,796 --> 00:06:43,843
That's right.

57
00:06:47,041 --> 00:06:51,739
Funds were allocated to create a remote
facility, where the test subjects were kept.

58
00:06:52,022 --> 00:06:54,551
It was known as "The Settlement".

59
00:06:55,588 --> 00:06:58,843
Ridiculous sums of money were poured into that place.

60
00:06:59,193 --> 00:07:02,957
Along with dozens of the most
talented researchers in the country.

61
00:07:07,748 --> 00:07:08,698
The caveat,

62
00:07:09,133 --> 00:07:12,304
this new "wonder drug" that had fallen into our laps?

63
00:07:12,771 --> 00:07:18,185
It was only effective on the still-developing
brains of children under the age of five.

64
00:07:21,424 --> 00:07:28,633
Unfortunately, the serum proved to be highly volatile to
the biological systems of the majority of test subjects.

65
00:07:29,688 --> 00:07:33,982
The bodies and minds of these children
were severely ravaged by the drug.

66
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:37,172
Most of them died shortly after infusion.

67
00:07:41,338 --> 00:07:42,588
I've heard enough!

68
00:07:42,729 --> 00:07:45,003
How can you talk about this like it was nothing?

69
00:07:47,644 --> 00:07:51,450
In the end. Athena was labeled a complete failure.

70
00:07:51,605 --> 00:07:55,389
The U.S. government had become
aware of the program and intervened.

71
00:07:55,455 --> 00:07:58,193
They shut the whole thing down seven years ago.

72
00:07:58,772 --> 00:07:59,395
Oh.

73
00:08:02,296 --> 00:08:04,437
Seems the tea's gotten cold.

74
00:08:07,424 --> 00:08:08,561
So why?

75
00:08:09,393 --> 00:08:11,755
Why did you wait until now to come clean?

76
00:08:12,312 --> 00:08:14,370
Honestly, if you hadn't come along.

77
00:08:14,416 --> 00:08:17,940
I'd have taken everything I knew
about the Athena Plan to the grave.

78
00:08:21,879 --> 00:08:23,842
Although, in all likelihood,

79
00:08:23,867 --> 00:08:27,628
I imagine those children would
probably not allow it to end that way.

80
00:08:29,129 --> 00:08:31,618
The moment I told you 'bout that damn project,

81
00:08:31,643 --> 00:08:35,037
I painted a target across my back. However,

82
00:08:35,713 --> 00:08:39,367
I'm getting old and tired. My body gets weaker every day.

83
00:08:40,489 --> 00:08:42,995
I can feel it. Not much time left.

84
00:08:43,296 --> 00:08:45,812
And the children at the Settlement. Where're they?

85
00:08:46,046 --> 00:08:50,864
When it was shut down, only one girl had
managed to survive the various experiments.

86
00:08:50,926 --> 00:08:55,915
One girl, taken into custody by an
American agency, and the files sealed.

87
00:08:56,392 --> 00:08:57,448
Interesting.

88
00:08:58,002 --> 00:08:59,106
Although...

89
00:08:59,619 --> 00:09:00,679
"Although" what?

90
00:09:00,704 --> 00:09:05,819
Apparently, there was a report saying two of
the children managed to escape the facility.

91
00:09:06,463 --> 00:09:08,321
Do you know their names, by chance?

92
00:09:08,754 --> 00:09:11,046
The subjects were never assigned names.

93
00:09:11,413 --> 00:09:14,930
Too empowering. Instead, they were called by a number.

94
00:09:15,838 --> 00:09:18,031
One of the boys was number Nine.

95
00:09:18,562 --> 00:09:20,580
The other was number Twelve.

96
00:09:21,546 --> 00:09:23,419
They managed to start a fire,

97
00:09:23,838 --> 00:09:27,064
then took the security systems down to make their escape.

98
00:09:27,631 --> 00:09:29,079
Clever little buggers.

99
00:09:29,228 --> 00:09:30,771
When did all this go down?

100
00:09:30,834 --> 00:09:32,670
Must've been eight years ago.

101
00:09:33,403 --> 00:09:35,421
If those boys are still alive,

102
00:09:35,446 --> 00:09:37,595
I guess they'd be about 17.

103
00:09:37,925 --> 00:09:39,190
It's gotta be them.

104
00:09:42,069 --> 00:09:44,278
I'd like to think they're still alive.

105
00:09:44,414 --> 00:09:49,247
Going to school in a nice, quiet
town, playing sports and chasing girls.

106
00:09:49,338 --> 00:09:53,213
Enjoying their lives before
the drug's side effects take over.

107
00:09:57,399 --> 00:09:59,483
You don't have the right to say that!

108
00:09:59,546 --> 00:10:03,220
Using children as your guinea pigs? You bastard.

109
00:10:03,553 --> 00:10:05,413
You can't even be called human!

110
00:10:05,777 --> 00:10:09,196
Yes. I stopped being human a long time ago.

111
00:10:09,389 --> 00:10:12,453
I was a pawn, a cog in the great machine.

112
00:10:12,706 --> 00:10:16,265
The orders came down from above. I just followed them.

113
00:10:16,796 --> 00:10:20,504
Yeah, the guards conducting inmate
selection at Auschwitz said the same thing.

114
00:10:20,641 --> 00:10:23,067
So you can save that tired old bullshit.

115
00:10:26,279 --> 00:10:28,350
Tell me who was in charge.

116
00:10:33,715 --> 00:10:35,517
It was Doctor Mamiya.

117
00:10:38,279 --> 00:10:39,261
Wasn't he...?

118
00:10:42,774 --> 00:10:44,121
Shibazaki.

119
00:10:46,138 --> 00:10:47,207
It can't be.

120
00:10:59,104 --> 00:11:00,898
Shunzo Mamiya, right?

121
00:11:01,102 --> 00:11:04,756
Isn't that the crotchety old bastard
who got you demoted in the first place?

122
00:11:05,312 --> 00:11:07,965
They call him the monster of Japanese politics.

123
00:11:08,661 --> 00:11:09,929
What are you gonna do?

124
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:33,124
This is Alpha One.

125
00:11:33,338 --> 00:11:35,252
We have visual confirmation.

126
00:11:35,463 --> 00:11:38,029
Five, should we move in to apprehend?

127
00:11:38,383 --> 00:11:39,642
Of course not!

128
00:11:39,856 --> 00:11:42,304
I mean, what's the point if can't have some fun?

129
00:11:57,163 --> 00:11:57,841
Lisa.

130
00:12:01,865 --> 00:12:02,842
Lisa!

131
00:12:04,171 --> 00:12:08,040
Oh, Twelve! I, This...

132
00:12:09,247 --> 00:12:12,051
The-They-They're all bombs.

133
00:12:12,404 --> 00:12:13,073
I don't...

134
00:12:15,038 --> 00:12:17,013
W-What do I do?

135
00:12:17,198 --> 00:12:19,060
Just be calm, 'kay?

136
00:12:28,607 --> 00:12:29,714
I'm scared.

137
00:12:30,637 --> 00:12:31,711
Damn her.

138
00:12:34,412 --> 00:12:37,296
I bet she thinks this is hilarious.

139
00:12:41,129 --> 00:12:43,629
It looks like he's enjoying himself to me.

140
00:12:43,713 --> 00:12:46,873
What're you doin', Five? We're supposed to capture 'im.

141
00:12:47,004 --> 00:12:50,019
He can't very well tell us the
location of the item if he's dead.

142
00:12:50,189 --> 00:12:54,715
Don't be such a downer, Clarence. No one
likes the loser who shuts down a party early.

143
00:12:59,372 --> 00:13:01,589
So do you have a plan?

144
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,157
Hold still.

145
00:13:11,213 --> 00:13:12,065
Twelve?

146
00:13:14,347 --> 00:13:17,221
It's gonna be fine. Don't you worry.

147
00:13:41,810 --> 00:13:42,787
Tch.

148
00:14:05,171 --> 00:14:06,504
All right.

149
00:14:14,379 --> 00:14:15,885
That's one down.

150
00:14:25,297 --> 00:14:27,732
What exactly are you hopin' to accomplish here?

151
00:14:28,292 --> 00:14:32,931
I know professional EOD guys who couldn't disarm
that many devices in the time you've given him.

152
00:14:33,421 --> 00:14:36,624
If the kid buys it, it'll be
harder to secure what we need.

153
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:38,951
It appears you've lost sight of our goal.

154
00:14:39,012 --> 00:14:39,917
Shut up!

155
00:15:04,810 --> 00:15:06,437
I'm sorry.

156
00:15:09,354 --> 00:15:13,818
If I hadn't left, those people wouldn't have grabbed me.

157
00:15:14,498 --> 00:15:18,229
I was just trying to stay out of the way for once,

158
00:15:18,261 --> 00:15:20,147
but I ended up making everything worse!

159
00:15:22,282 --> 00:15:23,569
I'm so sorry.

160
00:15:25,698 --> 00:15:26,292
Huh?

161
00:15:28,147 --> 00:15:30,831
No. You don't have to apologize.

162
00:15:31,398 --> 00:15:32,091
What?

163
00:15:32,713 --> 00:15:35,813
It's okay. This isn't your fault.

164
00:15:48,036 --> 00:15:51,159
I'm the reason you're here. Let me apologize.

165
00:15:54,046 --> 00:15:55,275
Nine was right.

166
00:15:56,923 --> 00:16:01,389
If I hadn't gotten you involved at the
airport, none of this would've happened.

167
00:16:03,962 --> 00:16:05,129
In fact,

168
00:16:05,313 --> 00:16:07,893
I never should've given you a ride that night.

169
00:16:09,867 --> 00:16:11,950
No, before that.

170
00:16:12,095 --> 00:16:15,080
I shouldn't have talked to you from the very beginning.

171
00:16:17,819 --> 00:16:21,345
I knew it would be dangerous. Getting to know somebody.

172
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:29,329
But...

173
00:16:32,245 --> 00:16:33,411
I had to.

174
00:17:14,518 --> 00:17:15,647
Thank you.

175
00:17:18,379 --> 00:17:22,314
But it's all right. I'm okay. Leave me.

176
00:17:23,667 --> 00:17:24,687
Lisa...

177
00:17:25,490 --> 00:17:27,924
You should go now, while there's still time.

178
00:17:28,477 --> 00:17:29,879
I'm not going anywhere!

179
00:17:30,214 --> 00:17:31,701
Nine's waiting for you.

180
00:17:35,821 --> 00:17:37,496
Please don't worry about me.

181
00:17:39,078 --> 00:17:41,206
You know he still needs your help.

182
00:17:42,963 --> 00:17:48,151
You two still have something important you
need to finish. The reason you came to Tokyo.

183
00:17:48,924 --> 00:17:51,899
Go, now. Make people see the truth.

184
00:18:22,879 --> 00:18:23,560
Tch.

185
00:18:24,296 --> 00:18:26,593
Hey! You having fun yet?

186
00:18:26,921 --> 00:18:27,760
Five!

187
00:18:28,463 --> 00:18:31,989
I propose a trade. Your girlfriend for the A-bomb.

188
00:18:32,794 --> 00:18:36,739
The cops seem to think you boys
stole a little plutonium from Aomori,

189
00:18:36,957 --> 00:18:41,831
but we know what you really took was Japan's
first in-house developed prototype atom bomb.

190
00:18:42,151 --> 00:18:46,087
Tell me where you stashed that sucker,
and I'll disarm your damsel in distress.

191
00:18:46,776 --> 00:18:49,655
C'mon! It's not a bad trade, really.

192
00:18:49,763 --> 00:18:54,180
Say no, and you two die. Say yes and you betray Nine.

193
00:18:54,412 --> 00:18:58,144
But you've already demonstrated that's
something you're willing to do, so give it up!

194
00:18:58,477 --> 00:18:59,804
Stop it, Five.

195
00:19:00,729 --> 00:19:03,629
You've already chosen that doe-eyed girl over Nine.

196
00:19:03,812 --> 00:19:07,171
After all you've been through,
how could you let Lisa down, now?

197
00:19:07,288 --> 00:19:09,185
Who cares about all that other stuff?

198
00:19:11,256 --> 00:19:13,359
Of course, Nine won't understand.

199
00:19:13,384 --> 00:19:16,641
But you should know that. He'll never forgive you.

200
00:19:17,223 --> 00:19:20,117
Why would he? You're an untrustworthy, cowardly traitor!

201
00:19:23,841 --> 00:19:26,693
If you don't talk, she will die.

202
00:19:27,464 --> 00:19:30,088
But at least she can die a lover's death with you.

203
00:19:30,254 --> 00:19:34,418
Eyes! Look your last! Arms, take your last embrace!

204
00:19:39,979 --> 00:19:41,598
Goodnight, Romeo.

205
00:19:42,884 --> 00:19:45,259
Parting is such sweet sorrow.

206
00:19:49,826 --> 00:19:53,401
The school! The bomb's in locker D-12!

207
00:19:59,387 --> 00:20:02,095
Congratulations, you saved your Juliet.

208
00:20:16,646 --> 00:20:18,173
Damn it, Twelve.

209
00:20:48,030 --> 00:20:49,366
We've lost visual.

210
00:20:49,537 --> 00:20:51,697
Roger that. Fan out and search.

211
00:20:57,171 --> 00:20:58,283
I've regained visual!

212
00:20:58,338 --> 00:20:59,816
Wait, take him alive!

213
00:21:03,838 --> 00:21:05,110
No! Stop!

214
00:21:08,318 --> 00:21:09,449
Five, what...?
