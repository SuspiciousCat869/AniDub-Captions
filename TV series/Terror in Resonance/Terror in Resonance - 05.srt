1
00:00:01,300 --> 00:00:05,905
Even though you answered correctly,
these friends of yours decided to cheat.

2
00:00:06,562 --> 00:00:09,073
Which means. Uh oh!

3
00:00:09,132 --> 00:00:11,455
The hidden bomb cannot be stopped!

4
00:00:15,177 --> 00:00:16,566
The entire planet?

5
00:00:16,796 --> 00:00:19,004
Do you, like, wanna blow it all up?

6
00:00:28,862 --> 00:00:29,597
Huh?

7
00:02:14,859 --> 00:02:15,859
Are you crazy?

8
00:02:15,884 --> 00:02:17,065
You shouldn't have brought her here.

9
00:02:17,465 --> 00:02:19,477
A runaway wandering around?

10
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:22,444
The cops almost caught her, and she could identify us.

11
00:02:22,682 --> 00:02:25,661
She's helpless, Nine. We should keep an eye on her.

12
00:02:26,422 --> 00:02:28,083
The girl is an outsider.

13
00:02:28,478 --> 00:02:32,573
She stays, and everything we've
fought to achieve is jeopardized.

14
00:02:39,278 --> 00:02:42,642
The thing is. She hasn't got anywhere else to go.

15
00:02:43,271 --> 00:02:46,602
And when she talked about making
her escape, it really hit home.

16
00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:49,373
Lisa isn't that different from us.

17
00:02:49,645 --> 00:02:54,706
I seem to remember you promising you
wouldn't get involved. It's for her own good.

18
00:02:55,268 --> 00:02:57,087
Getting all mixed up with us?

19
00:02:57,227 --> 00:02:59,746
You know that only leads to more misfortune.

20
00:03:08,768 --> 00:03:11,936
I was, that is, I'm sorry!

21
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,225
Wow. Talk about lucky.

22
00:03:17,453 --> 00:03:18,268
What?

23
00:03:18,293 --> 00:03:20,135
This little guy's no ordinary phone.

24
00:03:20,578 --> 00:03:24,262
See, that extinguisher is packed with plastic explosives.

25
00:03:24,408 --> 00:03:27,532
And that phone serves as the detonation switch.

26
00:03:27,955 --> 00:03:29,987
If the fuse had been connected,

27
00:03:30,478 --> 00:03:32,304
we would all be dead.

28
00:03:33,004 --> 00:03:33,786
Ka-bang!

29
00:03:36,731 --> 00:03:40,815
My bad. I forgot about the whole "you being sick" thing.

30
00:03:57,727 --> 00:03:59,982
Looks like the weather's held after all.

31
00:04:00,926 --> 00:04:05,347
Oh no. You're wrong. A storm's on the way.

32
00:04:19,505 --> 00:04:22,060
Make sure she cleans the filth
from the tub when she's done.

33
00:04:22,129 --> 00:04:23,133
Chill out.

34
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,488
I think it's been a while since she last had a bath.

35
00:04:25,878 --> 00:04:29,122
This girl isn't planning on gradually moving in, I hope.

36
00:04:31,594 --> 00:04:35,104
Anyway. Once her fever goes down, she has to go.

37
00:04:35,424 --> 00:04:38,746
Now, hold on! Keeping her here is absolutely pointless.

38
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:40,639
She'll just get in the way.

39
00:04:42,903 --> 00:04:46,611
The data leak caused by Sphinx's
recent attack exposed the progress of our

40
00:04:46,636 --> 00:04:48,835
current investigation to the general public.

41
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:50,850
Now they know how little we know.

42
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:53,893
Further failures will not be tolerated.

43
00:04:54,923 --> 00:04:59,725
We plan to increase personnel, focusing
on the cybercrime department specifically.

44
00:05:00,418 --> 00:05:03,303
We will then redouble our efforts to capture the bombers.

45
00:05:04,091 --> 00:05:06,647
To be frank, we have no other options.

46
00:05:11,021 --> 00:05:13,185
Thank you. You're all dismissed.

47
00:05:13,327 --> 00:05:14,702
Go make me proud.

48
00:05:21,433 --> 00:05:23,100
'Scuse us, coming through.

49
00:05:23,125 --> 00:05:24,919
Just some routine maintenance.

50
00:05:29,757 --> 00:05:30,532
Whoa!

51
00:05:35,699 --> 00:05:36,759
Excuse me.

52
00:05:40,113 --> 00:05:43,349
Yeah. Yeah, we just got here.

53
00:05:44,037 --> 00:05:46,159
Hang on a sec. Nah, it's nothin'.

54
00:05:46,643 --> 00:05:50,973
Don't worry about a thing. Okay. Gotcha. I'll tell her.

55
00:05:54,592 --> 00:05:55,178
What?

56
00:05:55,504 --> 00:05:56,378
Something wrong?

57
00:05:57,685 --> 00:06:00,160
Don't cha smell it? There's a fire!

58
00:06:00,185 --> 00:06:00,826
Hurry!

59
00:06:04,514 --> 00:06:06,659
Uh... Welcome home!

60
00:06:11,305 --> 00:06:14,413
There was no recipe, so I just kinda free-wheeled it.

61
00:06:15,718 --> 00:06:16,660
Dig in!

62
00:06:16,685 --> 00:06:17,739
Think I'll pass.

63
00:06:17,779 --> 00:06:18,439
What?

64
00:06:19,535 --> 00:06:20,807
Yeah it's inedible.

65
00:06:20,832 --> 00:06:23,910
Hey! You don't have to be so rude about it!

66
00:06:23,935 --> 00:06:25,513
Why don't you have a bite, then?

67
00:06:30,433 --> 00:06:31,469
Terrible.

68
00:06:31,494 --> 00:06:32,561
Told ya.

69
00:06:32,996 --> 00:06:34,329
Doesn't really matter.

70
00:06:34,403 --> 00:06:37,207
We never asked you to play house-mom for us, did we?

71
00:06:37,493 --> 00:06:40,190
If this was an attempt to show us how useful you are,

72
00:06:40,343 --> 00:06:41,898
then that plan backfired.

73
00:06:42,765 --> 00:06:44,540
Aren't cha still runnin' a fever?

74
00:06:44,628 --> 00:06:46,655
You should probably be back in bed.

75
00:06:47,622 --> 00:06:49,739
It's fine. Just go lie down.

76
00:06:57,071 --> 00:07:00,060
You know. Even the crummiest food is worth somethin'.

77
00:07:00,727 --> 00:07:01,200
Huh?

78
00:07:01,793 --> 00:07:04,625
Think about it. The food we ate at the institution.

79
00:07:04,717 --> 00:07:05,638
Do you remember?

80
00:07:11,471 --> 00:07:13,179
So many meals.

81
00:07:13,363 --> 00:07:15,404
I don't remember enjoying any of them.

82
00:07:15,719 --> 00:07:18,768
There was no taste. Just a task.

83
00:07:18,884 --> 00:07:20,889
Another job to be completed.

84
00:07:25,721 --> 00:07:26,838
It's almost time.

85
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:29,595
Hey, it's here! Come on!

86
00:07:30,734 --> 00:07:32,743
Greetings! I'm Sphinx Number One.

87
00:07:32,818 --> 00:07:37,710
I'm lookin' for a girlfriend to cook up
some bombs and tasty snacks. I'm Sphinx Two!

88
00:07:37,788 --> 00:07:40,876
Now then, everyone, you've seen our videos before.

89
00:07:40,901 --> 00:07:42,421
You know what happens next!

90
00:07:42,446 --> 00:07:44,442
That's right! It's riddle time!

91
00:07:44,496 --> 00:07:46,712
Today's mega-mystery question:

92
00:07:46,965 --> 00:07:52,393
Where do you go when you connect the dots
between the punishment of F-E-Z 58-89 and

93
00:07:52,418 --> 00:07:54,521
the angel who planted a grapevine?

94
00:07:54,696 --> 00:07:57,693
You have until, oh, eight o'clock this evening.

95
00:07:57,819 --> 00:07:59,373
Fail to solve it in time,

96
00:07:59,485 --> 00:08:02,211
and you're gonna have another big boom on your hands!

97
00:08:02,236 --> 00:08:04,736
Well then. Happy hunting, officers!

98
00:08:04,772 --> 00:08:06,188
God, I hate them.

99
00:08:06,352 --> 00:08:09,173
Kato, grab some analysts and get to work on this.

100
00:08:09,198 --> 00:08:10,095
Yes, sir!

101
00:08:10,810 --> 00:08:14,935
F-E-Z 58-89. What does that mean?

102
00:08:15,018 --> 00:08:17,235
License plate or...?

103
00:08:18,952 --> 00:08:19,696
Hey!

104
00:08:19,807 --> 00:08:20,983
Shibazaki, wait!

105
00:08:22,185 --> 00:08:22,820
Mukasa.

106
00:08:22,893 --> 00:08:25,013
Hm? Shibazaki?

107
00:08:25,188 --> 00:08:27,161
F-E-Z-5-8-8-9.

108
00:08:27,583 --> 00:08:29,464
Does that sequence mean anything to you?

109
00:08:29,489 --> 00:08:32,209
Huh? Yes, well?

110
00:08:32,234 --> 00:08:34,978
Come on. How many years you worked archives?

111
00:08:35,886 --> 00:08:37,706
What're you doing in the file room?

112
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,821
Find something that'll help solve the riddle?

113
00:08:42,548 --> 00:08:45,673
Document numbers. An old case file?

114
00:08:47,893 --> 00:08:51,768
The bombers must've seen our departmental
filing system after they hacked us.

115
00:08:52,025 --> 00:08:55,329
They only leaked files from the
current investigation to the public.

116
00:08:55,394 --> 00:08:59,015
But it's a reasonable assumption they
also got a hold of some older documents.

117
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:04,000
So long story short, they intentionally
made a riddle only the police would understand?

118
00:09:04,025 --> 00:09:06,477
Guess these terrorists have taken a shine to us.

119
00:09:06,593 --> 00:09:09,495
5-8-8-9. Found it!

120
00:09:10,431 --> 00:09:15,280
Let's see... Corporal punishment case
from the public high school in Tochigi?

121
00:09:15,477 --> 00:09:19,447
After showing up late to their club's
morning practice, four students got heat stroke

122
00:09:19,472 --> 00:09:22,310
after being forced to run in over 100 degree weather.

123
00:09:22,393 --> 00:09:25,584
All charges against the offender were dropped. Odd.

124
00:09:26,229 --> 00:09:28,889
So what's this got to do with the bombings?

125
00:09:33,643 --> 00:09:36,307
There's a passage in the Apocalypse of Baruch.

126
00:09:36,852 --> 00:09:39,227
The story of an angel who angered God.

127
00:09:39,704 --> 00:09:42,688
His offense was planting a
grapevine in the Garden of Eden.

128
00:09:43,161 --> 00:09:45,225
The Kabbalah identifies him as Samael,

129
00:09:45,291 --> 00:09:47,615
but he's also known as the Red Serpent.

130
00:09:47,908 --> 00:09:49,388
Hell of a nickname.

131
00:09:49,578 --> 00:09:51,980
So, tie it with the information from the file.

132
00:09:52,173 --> 00:09:54,851
High school kids punished by being forced to run.

133
00:09:55,528 --> 00:09:57,499
A red serpent forced to run.

134
00:09:57,746 --> 00:09:59,996
What does that sound like to you, Mukasa?

135
00:10:00,411 --> 00:10:03,108
Running red serpent? No clue.

136
00:10:03,477 --> 00:10:07,227
What could be stretched out
like a snake that runs? In a city?

137
00:10:08,125 --> 00:10:09,028
A train.

138
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:10,128
Right.

139
00:10:10,458 --> 00:10:12,922
And a red train in the middle of the city would be?

140
00:10:12,947 --> 00:10:15,296
The Shuto Shinjuku! Time to move!

141
00:10:15,415 --> 00:10:16,842
We gotta tell somebody!

142
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:19,232
The bomb's probably in one of the train cars.

143
00:10:19,276 --> 00:10:20,804
Then we'll have to check them all!

144
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:23,518
Subway, huh?

145
00:10:24,471 --> 00:10:27,119
These targets are all inter-connected somehow.

146
00:10:29,004 --> 00:10:31,933
I'm saying these aren't random acts of terrorism.

147
00:10:33,628 --> 00:10:36,586
Hey so, Nine. That last riddle we gave.

148
00:10:36,643 --> 00:10:38,477
Do you think it was a bit too simple?

149
00:10:38,553 --> 00:10:42,187
It would be problematic if it
was too hard for them to solve.

150
00:10:42,212 --> 00:10:44,207
I knew you made it easy on purpose!

151
00:10:44,834 --> 00:10:51,663
Yes. This Detective Shibazaki should have figured out the
connection between all of the bombing locations by now.

152
00:10:52,715 --> 00:10:54,618
Since we never make any demands,

153
00:10:54,643 --> 00:10:57,823
he's the kind who would look for a
connection to figure out what we're after.

154
00:10:58,537 --> 00:11:01,746
You sure have put a lot of
trust into a government official.

155
00:11:01,810 --> 00:11:02,537
What?

156
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:05,625
Heh! Nothin'. It was a joke.

157
00:11:08,943 --> 00:11:13,394
Governor Aohara, office in the Tokyo Metro
Government Building, site of the first bombing.

158
00:11:13,977 --> 00:11:17,446
Chief of Police at Roppongi Station,
location of the second bombing.

159
00:11:17,923 --> 00:11:23,249
A former Chief Cabinet Secretary and owner of the building
next to Shirahige Shrine, the failed third bombing.

160
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:28,681
And last, head of the municipal organization
that manages the Shuto Shinjuku Line.

161
00:11:29,345 --> 00:11:30,928
There's a connection between 'em.

162
00:11:31,064 --> 00:11:34,492
They all took part in a seminar
run by the Rising Peace Academy.

163
00:11:34,531 --> 00:11:36,212
The Rising Peace Academy?

164
00:11:36,291 --> 00:11:37,087
Yeah.

165
00:11:37,449 --> 00:11:40,518
'Promoting interaction between
the government and its people'.

166
00:11:40,602 --> 00:11:42,861
Looks like a non-profit on the surface.

167
00:11:43,102 --> 00:11:46,708
But their seminars have attracted a lot
of big-wig types over the last few years.

168
00:11:46,768 --> 00:11:49,403
From politicians to captains of industry.

169
00:11:49,518 --> 00:11:50,503
Pretty weird.

170
00:11:50,801 --> 00:11:52,010
No, not weird.

171
00:11:52,112 --> 00:11:54,466
This connects the dots between their targets.

172
00:11:55,573 --> 00:11:57,398
You're probably overthinking it.

173
00:11:57,785 --> 00:11:59,785
These kids just wanna watch our reaction.

174
00:12:00,195 --> 00:12:01,277
Not make a point.

175
00:12:01,302 --> 00:12:04,565
Oh, you've got some insight on terrorist psychology? Huh?

176
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:07,643
Uh... I wonder if they're done.

177
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:09,468
Dealing with the bomb, that is.

178
00:12:14,643 --> 00:12:15,400
Anything?

179
00:12:15,871 --> 00:12:17,200
Whole lotta nada.

180
00:12:17,747 --> 00:12:21,674
That's strange. There's been no
report about the bomb being removed.

181
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,339
Maybe the riddle was still too hard for them?

182
00:12:24,364 --> 00:12:27,016
I don't think so. That detective's smart.

183
00:12:27,041 --> 00:12:28,499
He should've figured it out.

184
00:12:28,524 --> 00:12:29,975
So what do we do?

185
00:12:30,351 --> 00:12:33,868
At this rate, in a little over
an hour, we'll be mass murderers.

186
00:12:35,143 --> 00:12:37,736
Not to worry. This will deactivate it.

187
00:12:38,518 --> 00:12:39,095
Huh?

188
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:40,595
What's wrong?

189
00:12:42,194 --> 00:12:44,704
That's crazy. No signal.

190
00:12:45,826 --> 00:12:48,903
What the...? Oh, ya gotta be kidding me!

191
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:49,963
Wha...?

192
00:12:50,238 --> 00:12:51,347
No signal.

193
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:52,390
Are you there?

194
00:12:54,358 --> 00:12:55,317
Weird.

195
00:12:59,025 --> 00:13:00,817
None on this one, either.

196
00:13:00,866 --> 00:13:03,486
Every carrier, same issue, same time?

197
00:13:03,611 --> 00:13:04,912
That's impossible!

198
00:13:05,062 --> 00:13:06,437
No, it's possible.

199
00:13:06,486 --> 00:13:09,251
Someone's creating this interference on purpose.

200
00:13:09,732 --> 00:13:12,039
Like who? Nine?

201
00:13:24,477 --> 00:13:25,977
Have you lost your mind?

202
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:28,021
Why haven't your people removed the bomb?

203
00:13:28,310 --> 00:13:30,602
We were given orders. Straight from the top.

204
00:13:30,658 --> 00:13:31,298
What?

205
00:13:31,727 --> 00:13:34,289
They said the special assault team would take care of it

206
00:13:34,936 --> 00:13:37,151
and we should standby for further instruction.

207
00:13:37,182 --> 00:13:37,920
But sir!

208
00:13:37,945 --> 00:13:39,526
So we just twiddle our thumbs?

209
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:40,613
That's what you're saying?

210
00:13:41,102 --> 00:13:42,392
I'm afraid so.

211
00:13:42,687 --> 00:13:44,663
And this electromagnetic jamming.

212
00:13:44,997 --> 00:13:46,591
It's got something to do with this?

213
00:13:47,191 --> 00:13:49,238
Look. I am out of the loop.

214
00:13:53,402 --> 00:13:56,190
Shibazaki! Don't do anything stupid!

215
00:13:56,215 --> 00:13:58,094
Has the past taught you nothing at all?

216
00:14:01,944 --> 00:14:03,161
Shibazaki!

217
00:14:05,810 --> 00:14:07,855
Check in. Can you hear me, Twelve?

218
00:14:08,247 --> 00:14:09,435
Loud and clear.

219
00:14:09,685 --> 00:14:10,975
Let's work fast.

220
00:14:11,081 --> 00:14:13,698
I can calculate the general location of the train car.

221
00:14:13,961 --> 00:14:15,901
But I won't be able to pinpoint it yet.

222
00:14:15,926 --> 00:14:19,481
For that, I'm gonna need to
access their system via a backdoor.

223
00:14:20,256 --> 00:14:22,513
I'll give you a more precise location later.

224
00:14:22,701 --> 00:14:24,826
The bomb is set to blow at eight sharp.

225
00:14:25,231 --> 00:14:27,728
We have to personally retrieve it before then.

226
00:14:27,951 --> 00:14:31,071
Remove and disarm the bomb in 50 minutes, undetected?

227
00:14:31,208 --> 00:14:32,198
Correct.

228
00:14:32,542 --> 00:14:34,535
What is this, Mission: Impossible?

229
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:35,994
This is the only way.

230
00:14:36,548 --> 00:14:39,464
We used five kilos of gunpowder this time around.

231
00:14:39,796 --> 00:14:42,898
That's more than enough to destroy the entire train car.

232
00:14:43,656 --> 00:14:45,111
Well, that's awesome.

233
00:14:45,970 --> 00:14:47,783
They should've solved the riddle by now.

234
00:14:47,808 --> 00:14:49,590
So what are the police up to?

235
00:14:49,895 --> 00:14:53,233
The electromagnetic interference
is blocking out cell service.

236
00:14:53,553 --> 00:14:55,768
I don't think this is a coincidence.

237
00:14:55,935 --> 00:14:59,596
Are you telling me someone outside the
police department is creating these problems

238
00:14:59,643 --> 00:15:01,282
to try and screw things up?

239
00:15:01,681 --> 00:15:04,019
And whoever that is, doesn't want the bomb stopped.

240
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:05,602
They want the thing to go off?

241
00:15:05,663 --> 00:15:07,076
It's the logical answer.

242
00:15:07,181 --> 00:15:08,696
That person's nutso.

243
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:13,514
To say the least. Yes. I'm in.

244
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:24,248
Wait. Whaddaya mean by "multiple signals?"

245
00:15:24,273 --> 00:15:29,018
Damn it! There's no way another train car
could have the same signature. It's impossible.

246
00:15:29,102 --> 00:15:30,400
Obviously not.

247
00:15:30,555 --> 00:15:33,028
We're being cornered with fake operations data.

248
00:15:33,148 --> 00:15:34,794
Someone's doing this.

249
00:15:35,392 --> 00:15:40,377
There must have been a trap in the backdoor I used
to infiltrate the train company's security interface.

250
00:15:40,845 --> 00:15:44,227
So the person behind all of this
knew we'd hack into the system.

251
00:15:44,273 --> 00:15:46,368
They set up a fake backdoor to trap us?

252
00:15:46,413 --> 00:15:48,805
Looks that way. Wait, here.

253
00:15:48,843 --> 00:15:51,438
I'll make another sweep through the normal OS now.

254
00:15:51,664 --> 00:15:53,287
Try to track the train down.

255
00:15:53,651 --> 00:15:56,318
In the meantime, hop onto the train car closest to you.

256
00:15:56,435 --> 00:15:58,611
But we only have 30 minutes.

257
00:15:58,636 --> 00:15:59,685
We don't have a choice!

258
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:02,460
Gotcha! No rest for the wicked!

259
00:16:07,054 --> 00:16:07,618
What?

260
00:16:07,643 --> 00:16:09,291
They cracked their way in?

261
00:16:13,042 --> 00:16:15,358
Whoever this is knows their stuff.

262
00:16:16,846 --> 00:16:17,968
No way.

263
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:32,399
Ready or not!

264
00:16:34,798 --> 00:16:37,111
Here I come!

265
00:16:42,198 --> 00:16:43,948
Ready or not!

266
00:16:45,533 --> 00:16:47,776
Here I come!

267
00:16:59,896 --> 00:17:02,368
It's her. She's back.

268
00:17:13,938 --> 00:17:16,268
Shibazaki. I've been looking for you.

269
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:18,251
Hamura. Any thoughts on this?

270
00:17:18,276 --> 00:17:19,030
On?

271
00:17:19,577 --> 00:17:22,979
They dispatched the Special Assault
Team without an official runner,

272
00:17:23,103 --> 00:17:26,268
and Kurahashi said the order came from top brass.

273
00:17:27,609 --> 00:17:28,780
Don't tell me...

274
00:17:28,805 --> 00:17:29,753
Do I have to?

275
00:17:29,934 --> 00:17:33,323
Y'know ferreting out rats is a real pain in the ass.

276
00:17:34,907 --> 00:17:36,814
You just gonna stand there, or are you comin'?

277
00:17:36,852 --> 00:17:37,480
Coming!

278
00:18:03,263 --> 00:18:07,029
Come on, 9-18! Damn!

279
00:18:18,675 --> 00:18:20,687
Uh, excuse me. I was...

280
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:23,930
Son of a...

281
00:18:24,623 --> 00:18:27,703
Anyway. Could you...

282
00:18:37,596 --> 00:18:39,055
What? It's close by?

283
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:41,064
If I head there from here, I might make it.

284
00:18:41,102 --> 00:18:43,202
Sounds good. I can wipe the camera feeds!

285
00:18:43,313 --> 00:18:43,978
Thanks!

286
00:19:21,455 --> 00:19:23,935
It's a bomb! Run, hurry!

287
00:19:23,965 --> 00:19:25,483
There's a bomb on the train!

288
00:19:55,841 --> 00:19:57,989
You wanna explain what the hell's goin' on?

289
00:19:58,014 --> 00:20:00,457
Shibazaki! Where was Special Assault Team?

290
00:20:00,482 --> 00:20:03,061
You pulled us off the bomb so they could deal with it!

291
00:20:03,839 --> 00:20:06,410
I was given every assurance they would.

292
00:20:06,435 --> 00:20:09,230
Yeah, from who? What bastard let this happen?

293
00:20:19,825 --> 00:20:22,440
Everyone please, try to stay calm!

294
00:20:22,465 --> 00:20:24,658
Exit the subway in an orderly fashion.

295
00:20:37,863 --> 00:20:39,423
Nine! Can you hear me?

296
00:20:40,025 --> 00:20:40,797
Yeah.

297
00:20:40,822 --> 00:20:42,721
Are you okay? Are you alive?

298
00:20:42,977 --> 00:20:44,369
Of course I am.

299
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:46,643
Please calm down, help is on the way!

300
00:20:52,412 --> 00:20:54,495
Hey, Nine. Is this?

301
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:58,460
Yeah. There's no doubt.

302
00:21:01,850 --> 00:21:03,466
Five is back.

303
00:21:06,009 --> 00:21:09,011
Such a spectacular fireworks display.

304
00:21:09,477 --> 00:21:11,821
Perfect for celebrating our reunion.

305
00:21:12,874 --> 00:21:15,926
Don't you think? Nine?
