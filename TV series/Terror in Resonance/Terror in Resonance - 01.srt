1
00:00:49,669 --> 00:00:51,523
It's the police. Hey.

2
00:00:51,981 --> 00:00:53,067
Do you know why they're here?

3
00:00:53,097 --> 00:00:54,440
No clue.

4
00:00:58,647 --> 00:01:00,422
Guardroom. What do you need?

5
00:01:09,435 --> 00:01:12,034
All right. That's good.

6
00:01:27,425 --> 00:01:27,997
Huh?

7
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:45,367
What's that about?

8
00:01:45,392 --> 00:01:46,160
Think it's a drill?

9
00:01:46,184 --> 00:01:46,736
I dunno.

10
00:01:46,761 --> 00:01:48,011
Hey, what's going on?

11
00:01:58,690 --> 00:01:59,644
Watch out!

12
00:02:20,503 --> 00:02:21,095
I dont' know, sir!

13
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,615
He's getting away! Gate Three!

14
00:02:30,569 --> 00:02:32,149
Stop! Hold fire!

15
00:02:47,024 --> 00:02:49,013
Woo-ho-hoo!

16
00:04:55,391 --> 00:04:57,597
Man, it's stupid hot.

17
00:04:57,622 --> 00:05:00,205
That makes sense. I mean, it is summer.

18
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:01,572
Come on, Nine.

19
00:05:01,648 --> 00:05:03,673
Don't tell me you're not dyin' out here.

20
00:05:03,698 --> 00:05:06,355
Speaking of don'ts. Don't do anything to stand out.

21
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:07,917
Try to act like a normal student.

22
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:09,889
Look! Kururin!

23
00:05:10,688 --> 00:05:13,255
It's so cute how his bangs look like ant antennae.

24
00:05:14,112 --> 00:05:15,282
I love that guy.

25
00:05:15,638 --> 00:05:18,066
I know. Did you listen to me at all?

26
00:05:22,855 --> 00:05:24,432
Ooh, I can smell chlorine!

27
00:05:25,774 --> 00:05:27,557
Do it already. Jump.

28
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:29,830
Don't be lame, Lame Lisa.

29
00:05:29,967 --> 00:05:31,263
Yeah! Dive!

30
00:05:31,306 --> 00:05:33,482
Fly away, Lisa! Forever!

31
00:05:36,521 --> 00:05:38,074
Hey ladies, whatcha up to?

32
00:05:39,135 --> 00:05:39,835
What?

33
00:05:40,036 --> 00:05:42,233
Um. Do we know this creeper?

34
00:05:42,423 --> 00:05:45,545
Oh! I get it! This is what they call "bullying"!

35
00:05:46,842 --> 00:05:49,191
No, it's not. She told us she wanted to swim.

36
00:05:49,404 --> 00:05:50,777
We're basically in a resort.

37
00:05:50,819 --> 00:05:52,463
Might as well take advantage.

38
00:05:52,795 --> 00:05:53,720
Right?

39
00:05:55,753 --> 00:05:57,069
Are you serious?

40
00:05:57,165 --> 00:05:58,913
You're gonna swim with your clothes on?

41
00:06:00,698 --> 00:06:02,512
Yeah. I guess so.

42
00:06:04,023 --> 00:06:05,277
'Cause I'm really hot.

43
00:06:11,243 --> 00:06:12,191
Cool, me, too!

44
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:18,480
Woo-hoo!

45
00:06:25,937 --> 00:06:29,419
That smile... It reminds me of something.

46
00:06:30,689 --> 00:06:32,732
The sun on a hot summer day.

47
00:06:37,386 --> 00:06:40,824
But those eyes are like ice.

48
00:06:46,548 --> 00:06:48,142
This is our new transfer student,

49
00:06:48,167 --> 00:06:49,609
Arata Kokonoe.

50
00:06:50,514 --> 00:06:52,188
It's nice to meet all of you.

51
00:06:52,404 --> 00:06:54,303
Right. Okay, let's see.

52
00:06:54,603 --> 00:06:57,395
Looks like you can take a seat by the window over there.

53
00:06:57,935 --> 00:06:58,740
I call dibs.

54
00:06:58,764 --> 00:06:59,151
Hooker!

55
00:06:59,176 --> 00:07:00,816
You already have a boyfriend!

56
00:07:10,813 --> 00:07:11,678
Wow...

57
00:07:12,198 --> 00:07:16,590
This is, um, wow, uh, Toji Hisami. Yeah.

58
00:07:16,738 --> 00:07:17,696
Jambo!

59
00:07:19,431 --> 00:07:20,644
We-hell!

60
00:07:22,447 --> 00:07:25,295
How sweet. Your boyfriend's in our class, Lame Lisa!

61
00:07:29,912 --> 00:07:32,175
And a cat won the internet, Shibazaki.

62
00:07:32,347 --> 00:07:34,395
That sucker is owning the moonwalk!

63
00:07:34,641 --> 00:07:35,482
I bet.

64
00:07:36,170 --> 00:07:39,041
I'm sure your shogi game's so
much more interesting, though.

65
00:07:39,466 --> 00:07:43,493
Huh? What is that? You have to check this out.

66
00:07:43,704 --> 00:07:44,255
Look!

67
00:07:45,588 --> 00:07:45,988
Tch.

68
00:07:48,205 --> 00:07:48,748
A'ight, people!

69
00:07:48,772 --> 00:07:50,171
Let's do this!

70
00:07:50,557 --> 00:07:52,706
What's up? I'm Sphinx Number One.

71
00:07:53,304 --> 00:07:54,276
Mm-hmm!

72
00:07:54,403 --> 00:07:57,202
I'm lucky Spinx Number Two, and I heart curry!

73
00:07:57,366 --> 00:08:00,746
So here's the thing, we've got
tomorrow's weather forecast for you all!

74
00:08:00,819 --> 00:08:04,253
After three PM, Tokyo will be enveloped in darkness.

75
00:08:04,443 --> 00:08:05,673
Ooh!

76
00:08:05,703 --> 00:08:09,794
Large sparks will fly, scattered around the Shinjuku area!

77
00:08:10,181 --> 00:08:12,105
I'd be careful out there if I were you.

78
00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:13,764
We wouldn't want anyone to die.

79
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:16,407
Well then, folks, have a nice day!

80
00:08:16,714 --> 00:08:19,273
Really, this crap is already showing up?

81
00:08:19,536 --> 00:08:22,272
These kids aren't even out for summer break, yet.

82
00:08:22,523 --> 00:08:23,092
Hey!

83
00:08:24,331 --> 00:08:26,775
Try to remember you both are still on the clock.

84
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:27,864
Stop screwing around.

85
00:08:27,889 --> 00:08:29,943
Oh, sorry, I, uh.

86
00:08:29,968 --> 00:08:30,994
Shibazaki.

87
00:08:31,094 --> 00:08:33,234
You're not still acting like a detective, are you?

88
00:08:33,259 --> 00:08:34,364
Because you're not one.

89
00:08:34,389 --> 00:08:37,759
Yeah, I know. I am well aware.

90
00:08:42,202 --> 00:08:44,048
Hello? We're talking to you!

91
00:08:44,713 --> 00:08:46,697
Can you hear us? Hey, Arata!

92
00:08:46,744 --> 00:08:48,012
Seriously!

93
00:08:50,283 --> 00:08:51,550
So, can I have your number?

94
00:08:51,575 --> 00:08:52,781
Yeah, I want it too!

95
00:08:52,805 --> 00:08:53,220
Me three!

96
00:08:53,245 --> 00:08:54,150
Let me send you my...

97
00:08:54,175 --> 00:08:57,193
No. I don't have a cell phone or anything.

98
00:08:57,268 --> 00:08:57,708
Huh?

99
00:08:57,732 --> 00:08:58,341
What?

100
00:09:12,413 --> 00:09:13,250
Idiot.

101
00:09:19,685 --> 00:09:21,060
Oh, hey! How's it goin'?

102
00:09:21,322 --> 00:09:23,982
I've already heard people talking about you, so guess.

103
00:09:24,171 --> 00:09:25,642
Not what we need right now.

104
00:09:25,667 --> 00:09:28,612
It's not a big deal, people are talking about you, too.

105
00:09:28,639 --> 00:09:29,819
No, they're not.

106
00:09:29,844 --> 00:09:30,852
Yes, they are.

107
00:09:30,883 --> 00:09:34,465
Shiori Nonami and Haruka Asami had a lot to say about you.

108
00:09:34,514 --> 00:09:36,292
Apparently, they think you're, like, "so hot."

109
00:09:36,317 --> 00:09:39,772
Why are you taking the time to remember
names of students from other classes?

110
00:09:39,797 --> 00:09:41,338
It's just not necessary.

111
00:09:41,431 --> 00:09:42,620
Yeah, yeah.

112
00:09:44,739 --> 00:09:45,959
Look, it's Lisa.

113
00:09:47,069 --> 00:09:48,774
Poor girl's takin' her lunch with her.

114
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,633
Bet she eats in the bathroom.

115
00:09:50,752 --> 00:09:52,133
Do not get involved.

116
00:09:52,372 --> 00:09:53,817
I won't.

117
00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:06,603
More texts from Mom.

118
00:11:09,442 --> 00:11:10,078
Nine?

119
00:11:11,779 --> 00:11:13,834
Oh. Same nightmare again?

120
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:18,988
To be honest, I had a feeling that would happen.

121
00:11:20,806 --> 00:11:22,010
Well because of Lisa.

122
00:11:22,368 --> 00:11:25,514
Her eyes look exactly like those
kids' eyes from the institution.

123
00:11:26,648 --> 00:11:27,767
You know it's true.

124
00:11:30,203 --> 00:11:32,227
All of those children were weak.

125
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:33,998
That's why they died.

126
00:11:35,717 --> 00:11:36,949
We were weak, too.

127
00:11:38,085 --> 00:11:39,909
That's why we couldn't save them.

128
00:11:41,509 --> 00:11:42,348
And now?

129
00:11:43,596 --> 00:11:45,967
Now, things are different. We're strong.

130
00:12:00,684 --> 00:12:01,329
Alright.

131
00:12:03,264 --> 00:12:04,152
Right?

132
00:12:04,176 --> 00:12:05,470
I mean, yeah.

133
00:12:18,389 --> 00:12:19,942
So adorable.

134
00:12:20,662 --> 00:12:22,077
Three more minutes.

135
00:12:22,284 --> 00:12:26,278
26 until the power generators
kick in and electricity is restored.

136
00:12:26,306 --> 00:12:27,245
Roger!

137
00:12:27,725 --> 00:12:29,098
Are we straight on the plan?

138
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:31,779
Who do you think I am?

139
00:12:35,572 --> 00:12:36,605
It's almost time.

140
00:13:02,589 --> 00:13:05,086
I wish they'd all disappear.

141
00:13:24,603 --> 00:13:26,295
Plus wi-fi... Uh?

142
00:13:30,911 --> 00:13:32,107
The lights?

143
00:13:33,319 --> 00:13:35,746
Huh? Is it a blackout?

144
00:13:36,152 --> 00:13:39,962
Hm? Ah, it'll switch to the backup generators eventually.

145
00:13:40,241 --> 00:13:41,388
Yeah, I guess.

146
00:13:45,487 --> 00:13:49,066
"After three PM, Tokyo will be enveloped in darkness."

147
00:13:50,325 --> 00:13:53,864
Mukasa can you find that video
from yesterday on your phone?

148
00:13:53,889 --> 00:13:54,278
Huh?

149
00:13:55,502 --> 00:13:56,806
Your attention, please.

150
00:13:56,831 --> 00:13:59,001
You'll need to use the stairs to exit the building.

151
00:13:59,221 --> 00:14:02,729
I'm scared, mommy. I'm scared.

152
00:14:03,155 --> 00:14:06,259
Mommy! Mom!

153
00:14:36,605 --> 00:14:37,997
It's you. Hey.

154
00:14:43,935 --> 00:14:45,847
You really shouldn't be in here, you know.

155
00:14:45,887 --> 00:14:46,561
Eh?

156
00:14:47,741 --> 00:14:49,813
So what... are you playing hide and seek?

157
00:14:54,092 --> 00:14:55,272
You can borrow that.

158
00:14:55,323 --> 00:14:58,712
It sucks hiding all by yourself. Now you won't get lonely.

159
00:14:58,955 --> 00:15:00,350
Oh, I, uh!

160
00:15:01,107 --> 00:15:02,330
Promise me something.

161
00:15:02,972 --> 00:15:06,346
Don't let go of him. Not until I say it's okay.

162
00:15:06,766 --> 00:15:10,314
Hold up. What is this? Where are you going?

163
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:15,241
After three PM, Tokyo will be enveloped by darkness.

164
00:15:15,361 --> 00:15:16,601
Ooh!

165
00:15:16,699 --> 00:15:20,127
Large sparks will fly, scattered around the Shinjuku area!

166
00:15:20,152 --> 00:15:23,067
Nah. This has to be a coincidence.

167
00:15:23,107 --> 00:15:24,562
Wouldn't want anyone to die.

168
00:15:24,785 --> 00:15:26,429
Well then, folks...

169
00:15:55,847 --> 00:15:57,488
Did all go according to plan?

170
00:15:57,643 --> 00:16:00,027
Mostly. There's just one little hitch.

171
00:16:01,062 --> 00:16:05,086
It's Lisa. She saw me inside.

172
00:16:38,745 --> 00:16:39,965
I left her in there.

173
00:16:40,544 --> 00:16:43,241
If we don't do anything, she'll most likely get killed,

174
00:16:43,528 --> 00:16:45,208
but I did give her a Kururin.

175
00:16:47,557 --> 00:16:48,433
This way,

176
00:16:48,556 --> 00:16:50,675
we can either put her out of her misery,

177
00:16:50,805 --> 00:16:52,781
or we can go in and save her.

178
00:16:52,806 --> 00:16:55,573
I figured you'd like to have a choice in how we proceed.

179
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:57,560
What is this?

180
00:16:57,772 --> 00:17:00,077
Are you trying to make me relive that moment?

181
00:17:02,976 --> 00:17:04,899
You know she's not one of us.

182
00:17:05,106 --> 00:17:07,383
I'm aware. It's just...

183
00:17:07,956 --> 00:17:08,751
I dunno.

184
00:17:08,776 --> 00:17:11,339
I thought maybe this could
help you stop having that dream.

185
00:17:18,088 --> 00:17:18,712
Hello.

186
00:17:18,736 --> 00:17:19,304
Huh?

187
00:17:20,376 --> 00:17:22,401
Did you keep your promise and hang onto him?

188
00:17:22,627 --> 00:17:26,118
Give it. Listen up, you have two options here.

189
00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:31,052
Choice one, you can die where you stand.

190
00:17:31,695 --> 00:17:35,217
Or choice two: you can become an accomplice.

191
00:17:36,050 --> 00:17:37,381
Accomplice?

192
00:17:37,527 --> 00:17:39,678
It's up to you. What'll it be?

193
00:17:40,349 --> 00:17:42,919
I, uh, I don't know.

194
00:17:48,556 --> 00:17:49,295
I don't...

195
00:17:51,222 --> 00:17:52,221
...wanna die.

196
00:17:52,319 --> 00:17:53,347
Alright!

197
00:17:53,889 --> 00:17:55,722
From the resonance I'm getting on my end,

198
00:17:55,747 --> 00:17:58,177
you must be in the stairwell. What floor?

199
00:17:59,301 --> 00:18:01,600
Uh, the sixteenth?

200
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:02,634
Got it.

201
00:18:03,472 --> 00:18:06,181
Take the stairs all the way down to the fourth floor.

202
00:18:27,593 --> 00:18:30,832
When you get to Four, take 15 steps forward.

203
00:18:31,474 --> 00:18:33,629
Then move 23 steps to the right.

204
00:18:34,235 --> 00:18:37,672
Take 12 steps forward. When you're there...

205
00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:41,754
...leave the plushie at your feet.

206
00:18:55,971 --> 00:18:59,321
Go back the way you came and hide
in the hallway. Keep to the shadows.

207
00:18:59,621 --> 00:19:00,648
Do it now!

208
00:19:28,252 --> 00:19:29,397
Do it already.

209
00:19:29,457 --> 00:19:32,023
Fly away, Lisa! Forever!

210
00:19:32,435 --> 00:19:34,752
It's up to you. What'll it be?

211
00:19:35,619 --> 00:19:38,083
So, what? Playing hide and seek?

212
00:20:43,293 --> 00:20:47,025
Remember, you chose this path. Not us.

213
00:20:47,205 --> 00:20:48,964
Do you understand what you've agreed to?

214
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:49,966
I...

215
00:20:51,446 --> 00:20:53,817
Lisa, there's no going back.

216
00:21:01,096 --> 00:21:02,215
That smile...

217
00:21:04,126 --> 00:21:05,998
It reminds me of something.

218
00:21:08,567 --> 00:21:11,593
The sun on a hot summer day.

219
00:21:12,764 --> 00:21:16,398
But those eyes are like ice.
