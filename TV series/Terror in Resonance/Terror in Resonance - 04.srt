1
00:00:02,253 --> 00:00:03,059
Who's there?

2
00:00:04,076 --> 00:00:04,926
Lisa?

3
00:00:05,313 --> 00:00:06,691
Lisa, is that you?

4
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:15,147
There you have it. The answer to your riddle.

5
00:00:15,256 --> 00:00:16,547
Oh, ho!

6
00:00:16,572 --> 00:00:20,570
I hope you boys realize the joker
you're wavin' around is not a toy.

7
00:00:20,604 --> 00:00:22,250
The cops have connected it.

8
00:00:22,275 --> 00:00:25,543
They definitely know we were
the ones who stole the plutonium.

9
00:00:25,568 --> 00:00:27,727
I will take you both out myself!

10
00:02:09,858 --> 00:02:12,005
Hey. I got stuck in Shibuya.

11
00:02:12,351 --> 00:02:14,518
It totally started raining cats and dogs.

12
00:02:14,655 --> 00:02:16,052
Yeah, like out of nowhere.

13
00:02:16,077 --> 00:02:18,581
And of course, I just got my hair done.

14
00:02:19,596 --> 00:02:21,922
Uh-oh. The cops just stopped two guys.

15
00:02:21,988 --> 00:02:23,910
They look like high schoolers.

16
00:02:25,306 --> 00:02:27,803
That sucks. They're both kinda cute.

17
00:02:30,531 --> 00:02:33,123
What can I say? I like bad boys.

18
00:02:45,438 --> 00:02:47,672
The expert analysis of the bomb we recovered

19
00:02:47,697 --> 00:02:52,772
from the building next to the Shirahige Shrine in
Katsushika has produced some interesting results.

20
00:02:53,163 --> 00:02:58,475
This device was an "ammonium nitrate fuel oil
type" commonly used as an industrial explosive.

21
00:02:58,546 --> 00:03:01,291
From the model number left on the electric detonator.

22
00:03:01,636 --> 00:03:06,740
We've been able to trace its purchase back to a
demolitions manufacturer called Showa Gunpowder.

23
00:03:06,765 --> 00:03:07,316
Wait a minute.

24
00:03:07,341 --> 00:03:07,830
Therefore...

25
00:03:07,869 --> 00:03:12,840
These parts commonly used by terrorists to
make bombs are just available to the public?

26
00:03:12,865 --> 00:03:15,362
As long as their application form has been approved,

27
00:03:15,387 --> 00:03:17,862
yes, someone could gain access to these items.

28
00:03:20,032 --> 00:03:21,001
Please continue.

29
00:03:21,091 --> 00:03:21,891
Yes sir.

30
00:03:22,541 --> 00:03:25,164
The suspect posed as an employee of Hanabayashi,

31
00:03:25,189 --> 00:03:26,604
a building contractor.

32
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:32,613
They forged the application and illegally obtained
someone else's credit card info to purchase the gunpowder.

33
00:03:32,717 --> 00:03:35,363
How were they able to use some else's credit card?

34
00:03:35,447 --> 00:03:38,488
Probably through an illegal website from Russia or China.

35
00:03:38,572 --> 00:03:41,286
A clean card's info can be bought for next to nothing.

36
00:03:44,227 --> 00:03:49,923
Because they used a form of virtual currency to
buy the card, the transaction is impossible to trace.

37
00:03:51,186 --> 00:03:55,564
My subordinates are currently combing through
surveillance footage from Showa Gunpowder.

38
00:03:55,644 --> 00:03:58,630
We hope to find an image of
the suspect picking up his order.

39
00:03:58,655 --> 00:04:02,332
In addition, we have the relevant
usage history of the credit card.

40
00:04:02,412 --> 00:04:08,532
They bought electrical tape and a delivery box. As
well as a soba shop worker's outfit all on the same day.

41
00:04:08,557 --> 00:04:09,688
Where were they purchased?

42
00:04:09,713 --> 00:04:11,632
Entirely online, from Amazon.

43
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:14,911
Each time, the packages were picked up at the supermarket,

44
00:04:14,936 --> 00:04:17,571
but any surveillance footage has been deleted.

45
00:04:18,553 --> 00:04:22,822
So you're telling me we don't have a
single clue that'd lead us to the culprits?

46
00:04:22,847 --> 00:04:24,331
Is that the long and short of it?

47
00:04:24,796 --> 00:04:26,479
Get back to me when you know something.

48
00:04:44,482 --> 00:04:47,233
It sorta feels like we're just treadin' water here.

49
00:04:47,258 --> 00:04:49,388
The more we chase, the more they leave us behind.

50
00:04:49,838 --> 00:04:53,727
Yeah. Wonder if these leads could've
been planted as disinformation.

51
00:04:53,923 --> 00:04:55,422
Like counter-intelligence?

52
00:04:55,593 --> 00:04:58,697
You really think a couple kids could
pull off such a complicated stunt?

53
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:01,780
Shibazaki seems to believe these two are capable of a lot.

54
00:05:01,805 --> 00:05:04,270
Yeah. Speaking of Shibazaki.

55
00:05:04,624 --> 00:05:05,904
Where did he go?

56
00:05:06,566 --> 00:05:09,262
He said something about heading to Aomori.

57
00:05:15,345 --> 00:05:17,772
Excuse me. You're Yoshiharu Ebisuno.

58
00:05:17,797 --> 00:05:18,779
Is that right?

59
00:05:19,208 --> 00:05:19,812
Yeah?

60
00:05:19,837 --> 00:05:22,461
I'm Detective Shibazaki, Metro P.D.

61
00:05:25,538 --> 00:05:28,255
So what. This fella do somethin'?

62
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:31,127
Nah he's just a witness for a minor incident.

63
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:33,380
I've been asking around all day.

64
00:05:33,405 --> 00:05:36,041
But no one seems to remember anything about the guy.

65
00:05:36,158 --> 00:05:39,791
Well, he weren't one to
fraternize with his coworkers much.

66
00:05:40,464 --> 00:05:43,679
Even durin' lunch, he'd always
have them earphones in his head.

67
00:05:43,876 --> 00:05:46,710
So I said "you always got them earphones in.

68
00:05:46,735 --> 00:05:52,072
What're ya listenin' to?" Then, he just
looked at me and says "Music from a cold land."

69
00:05:52,213 --> 00:05:53,756
"A cold land?"

70
00:05:54,968 --> 00:05:57,482
Anything else stand out in your memory as odd?

71
00:05:57,707 --> 00:05:59,842
Even the most trivial detail?

72
00:06:00,414 --> 00:06:01,331
Uh-huh.

73
00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:04,507
I asked him what his old man did for a livin' once.

74
00:06:04,667 --> 00:06:06,922
The kid just clammed up real fast.

75
00:06:07,164 --> 00:06:10,395
It seemed like maybe I'd hit
a nerve or somethin' like that.

76
00:06:13,652 --> 00:06:18,106
Father. Oedipus killed his father.

77
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:20,234
Riddles.

78
00:06:20,813 --> 00:06:21,836
Bombings.

79
00:06:22,629 --> 00:06:23,998
Missing plutonium.

80
00:06:25,786 --> 00:06:28,805
They're all interconnected. But how?

81
00:06:30,916 --> 00:06:33,791
What were you expecting? A welcome mat?

82
00:06:33,988 --> 00:06:36,572
No. But this is a Dual EC encryption.

83
00:06:36,597 --> 00:06:38,102
There has to be a backdoor.

84
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:42,579
Hm. That one looked weird.

85
00:06:48,681 --> 00:06:49,473
Hello!

86
00:06:49,498 --> 00:06:50,844
It was a web shell.

87
00:06:55,529 --> 00:06:56,502
Jackpot!

88
00:06:59,378 --> 00:07:03,143
So, like, I messaged him back, and it said he read it.

89
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:05,650
But then, like, that was it, no response.

90
00:07:05,875 --> 00:07:09,751
I mean. What's with that? Boys are so weird, right?

91
00:07:11,559 --> 00:07:13,048
How was Aomori?

92
00:07:13,296 --> 00:07:14,781
It's cooler up there, isn't it?

93
00:07:15,322 --> 00:07:17,562
It was pretty much the same as here.

94
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:20,918
Can I bum one of those? What? I thought you quit smoking.

95
00:07:22,193 --> 00:07:24,172
One. Just having one.

96
00:07:25,518 --> 00:07:28,102
So you learn anything about our culprit?

97
00:07:28,829 --> 00:07:30,750
He wasn't much of a social type.

98
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:36,267
Very few of his fellow employees even remembered
him working there, much less anything noteworthy.

99
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:40,604
It's almost as if this guy
never existed in the first place.

100
00:07:40,913 --> 00:07:43,279
Then this kid is practically a ghost?

101
00:07:43,623 --> 00:07:46,604
They've been careful to cover
their tracks up to this point.

102
00:07:47,307 --> 00:07:49,466
They sure didn't leave any clues in Aomori.

103
00:07:50,447 --> 00:07:53,402
Yeah? Then why'd you bother to go all the way up there?

104
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:57,320
No matter how cleverly you erase records and cover tracks,

105
00:07:57,436 --> 00:08:01,582
you can't erase a person's memory. Besides...

106
00:08:02,512 --> 00:08:03,348
What's that?

107
00:08:04,488 --> 00:08:06,472
I needed to be there in person.

108
00:08:07,425 --> 00:08:11,528
To see the view they saw. To hear the same sounds.

109
00:08:12,288 --> 00:08:13,907
To breathe the same air.

110
00:08:16,616 --> 00:08:18,454
To feel the same things.

111
00:08:21,155 --> 00:08:23,648
Hey. I'm headin' out to run a few errands.

112
00:08:23,697 --> 00:08:26,454
Sounds good. I'll finish up the next present.

113
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:27,805
A summer gift, eh?

114
00:08:27,907 --> 00:08:29,706
Just in time for the Obon Festival.

115
00:08:36,229 --> 00:08:38,697
This year, we have a reason to celebrate.

116
00:08:42,488 --> 00:08:43,745
Look, Shibazaki,

117
00:08:43,893 --> 00:08:46,400
I hate to say this since you're paying and all,

118
00:08:46,547 --> 00:08:49,255
but I wouldn't mind something
other than ramen once in a while.

119
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:55,020
Hey. The phrase "music from a cold land".

120
00:08:55,190 --> 00:08:57,077
What does that make you think of?

121
00:08:57,651 --> 00:09:02,485
"A cold land"? Hm. Every single Christmas song?

122
00:09:02,621 --> 00:09:04,621
Or maybe like the Russian anthem?

123
00:09:04,738 --> 00:09:05,819
Huh.

124
00:09:06,968 --> 00:09:10,260
We interrupt this program to bring you this breaking news.

125
00:09:10,592 --> 00:09:15,087
We have just received updated information
regarding the recent spate of terrorist bombings.

126
00:09:15,199 --> 00:09:19,672
A new video has now been made public on a
media sharing website announcing the next attack.

127
00:09:19,778 --> 00:09:20,543
Yeah.

128
00:09:21,254 --> 00:09:22,447
I'm watching it now.

129
00:09:22,533 --> 00:09:25,221
Good evening. This is Sphinx Number One.

130
00:09:25,246 --> 00:09:30,838
Ladies, I like moonlit strolls, romantic
dinners and explosives! I'm Sphinx Number Two.

131
00:09:30,863 --> 00:09:32,988
When exactly was the video posted?

132
00:09:33,038 --> 00:09:34,932
...are you ready to play Time Shock Bomb?

133
00:09:35,796 --> 00:09:39,924
At the place where the king who solved the riddle
received a frightening prophecy, whose appellation

134
00:09:40,072 --> 00:09:43,144
would you carve on its entrance?

135
00:09:44,091 --> 00:09:46,749
Solve the riddle to stop our biggest bomb yet.

136
00:09:46,791 --> 00:09:49,054
Buzzers ready? It's time to play!

137
00:09:49,079 --> 00:09:53,197
And I sincerely hope you'll play with
boys like us without resorting to cheating.

138
00:09:54,410 --> 00:09:58,943
Until then, we'll be wishing you good
luck at the king's final destination!

139
00:09:59,202 --> 00:10:03,211
Oh! And when you come, make sure
to use letters, not bronze, okay?

140
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:05,584
Crazy, right?

141
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:10,353
The footage you just saw was made public mere moments ago.

142
00:10:11,053 --> 00:10:13,985
Wait! Shibazaki! You didn't pay!

143
00:10:16,105 --> 00:10:17,975
The king who solved the riddle.

144
00:10:18,092 --> 00:10:20,969
Oedipus' final destination was the underworld.

145
00:10:21,932 --> 00:10:23,822
After gouging out his own eyes,

146
00:10:24,005 --> 00:10:30,355
his two daughters acted as his guides leading him down the
great bronze stairway to the very gates of the underworld.

147
00:10:31,678 --> 00:10:35,568
Bronze stairs. But in the video
they said to use letters instead.

148
00:10:35,671 --> 00:10:36,963
A letter staircase?

149
00:10:36,988 --> 00:10:40,473
Right. Let the letters lead you down to the gateway?

150
00:10:43,571 --> 00:10:44,545
That's it.

151
00:10:45,525 --> 00:10:46,557
C'mon.

152
00:10:50,447 --> 00:10:51,463
That's not good.

153
00:10:51,488 --> 00:10:53,485
So the Internet is the underworld?

154
00:10:55,356 --> 00:10:56,241
Delphi?

155
00:10:56,266 --> 00:10:58,641
The Oracle of Delphi gave him the prophecy.

156
00:10:59,106 --> 00:11:02,413
There are three maxims inscribed
on the entrance to the temple.

157
00:11:03,253 --> 00:11:06,412
"Know thyself." "Nothing in excess."

158
00:11:06,437 --> 00:11:09,158
And, "Make a pledge and mischief is nigh."

159
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:13,010
It was in a shrine last time. Could be in a temple?

160
00:11:13,035 --> 00:11:14,057
Forget it.

161
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:18,501
If we enter the name of the person the
maxims are referring to as the password,

162
00:11:18,941 --> 00:11:21,088
the bomb will probably deactivate.

163
00:11:21,113 --> 00:11:22,425
Can't be that easy.

164
00:11:22,461 --> 00:11:24,797
I bet it's just something they
put in to make us waste time.

165
00:11:24,822 --> 00:11:27,083
He's right! This could just be a decoy.

166
00:11:27,108 --> 00:11:27,823
No.

167
00:11:30,812 --> 00:11:33,586
That's the police station they attacked over in Roppongi!

168
00:11:41,281 --> 00:11:42,874
So we have until midnight?

169
00:11:43,313 --> 00:11:45,480
Well, I'm not gonna sit around on my thumbs!

170
00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:48,005
We need to coordinate a search of all temples and shrines!

171
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:48,953
We're on it, sir.

172
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,871
Hey wait. What're you up to?

173
00:11:56,843 --> 00:11:58,297
Would you quit messin' with it?

174
00:11:58,396 --> 00:12:01,812
This is the first time those
two have made any kind of request.

175
00:12:01,943 --> 00:12:06,099
It could be their version of a response
to what I said the other day on the news.

176
00:12:06,985 --> 00:12:08,735
They want us to play.

177
00:12:25,597 --> 00:12:27,630
Hey baby. Whatcha doin'?

178
00:12:27,655 --> 00:12:30,380
You alone? Maybe you want a little company?

179
00:12:30,613 --> 00:12:32,462
I know a real nice place.

180
00:12:32,828 --> 00:12:33,688
No!

181
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:40,830
Hm.

182
00:13:07,522 --> 00:13:10,822
"I won't get too involved." That's what you said.

183
00:13:10,988 --> 00:13:12,115
Yes, I know.

184
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:15,978
And I won't get too involved. But uh...

185
00:13:16,605 --> 00:13:17,578
But what?

186
00:13:18,209 --> 00:13:21,058
Well, she's... It looks like she ran away.

187
00:13:22,213 --> 00:13:23,997
If she gets taken into custody.

188
00:13:24,113 --> 00:13:26,397
She may end up saying something about us.

189
00:13:26,810 --> 00:13:28,054
That would be bad.

190
00:13:28,323 --> 00:13:29,323
Your point?

191
00:13:29,672 --> 00:13:30,816
I'm just saying.

192
00:13:31,124 --> 00:13:33,636
I think it'd be better if we kept a close eye on her.

193
00:13:36,447 --> 00:13:39,373
Trapped your Queen. You should have sacrificed her.

194
00:13:41,525 --> 00:13:42,927
Here, guys. Take a look.

195
00:13:44,127 --> 00:13:47,675
This is footage of the suspect picking
up their order from Showa Gunpowder.

196
00:13:49,108 --> 00:13:51,261
A few minutes later, he shows up again.

197
00:13:52,338 --> 00:13:55,162
This is surveillance footage
from a nearby apartment building.

198
00:13:55,447 --> 00:13:56,475
Last stop.

199
00:13:57,843 --> 00:13:59,685
He gets off on the sixth floor.

200
00:14:00,572 --> 00:14:01,800
Nice work, son.

201
00:14:02,447 --> 00:14:04,741
We'd better move. There isn't much time.

202
00:14:05,006 --> 00:14:06,672
Full emergency deployment.

203
00:14:06,697 --> 00:14:07,321
Yes, sir!

204
00:14:17,391 --> 00:14:20,030
Hey! We got a lead on where they're hiding out!

205
00:14:20,112 --> 00:14:20,701
Huh?

206
00:14:20,726 --> 00:14:22,594
Little twerps have finally screwed up!

207
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:24,380
C'mon, let's roll!

208
00:14:24,405 --> 00:14:25,462
I'll leave that to you.

209
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:29,790
Huh? There's no need to solve their stupid riddle anymore.

210
00:14:29,822 --> 00:14:33,177
That's where you're wrong.
The video said to stop the bomb.

211
00:14:33,590 --> 00:14:36,588
Last time they said "search for", this time it's "stop."

212
00:14:36,613 --> 00:14:37,672
Are you serious?

213
00:14:37,697 --> 00:14:38,471
I am.

214
00:14:38,686 --> 00:14:41,348
They gave us a puzzle, and said not to cheat.

215
00:14:41,832 --> 00:14:42,820
Meaning.

216
00:14:44,813 --> 00:14:46,797
Do you wanna play their twisted game?

217
00:14:46,908 --> 00:14:48,965
Or do you wanna help us put an end to it?

218
00:14:53,453 --> 00:14:56,876
Shibazaki? You gonna be all right?

219
00:15:02,897 --> 00:15:03,923
Whatcha doin'?

220
00:15:11,442 --> 00:15:12,606
You should go home.

221
00:15:14,389 --> 00:15:16,717
Places like this aren't very safe at night.

222
00:15:18,488 --> 00:15:19,655
Leave me alone.

223
00:15:19,684 --> 00:15:22,866
I can't have you wandering
around, it could cause problems.

224
00:15:23,010 --> 00:15:23,968
Just shut up!

225
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:24,581
Hm?

226
00:15:27,673 --> 00:15:30,308
I don't really have a home I can go to anymore.

227
00:15:33,291 --> 00:15:36,539
I'm so stupid. I thought that somehow.

228
00:15:36,914 --> 00:15:39,834
Somehow I could escape from it all. Like...

229
00:15:40,513 --> 00:15:43,953
Like someone would come and lift
me out of my miserable, boring life.

230
00:15:44,537 --> 00:15:46,259
Like it was all a bad dream.

231
00:15:48,394 --> 00:15:50,000
But that's impossible, right?

232
00:15:50,299 --> 00:15:54,579
I'm here. I'm awake. This isn't some weird dream.

233
00:15:54,776 --> 00:15:57,300
And things don't just work themselves out.

234
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,801
So stupid.

235
00:16:32,947 --> 00:16:34,260
Good evening, miss.

236
00:16:34,312 --> 00:16:36,667
Is there any reason you're out so late?

237
00:16:45,981 --> 00:16:48,959
Ah! Hey, what do you think you're doing, Shibazaki?

238
00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:50,527
You can't smoke in here!

239
00:16:50,587 --> 00:16:51,488
Window.

240
00:16:51,572 --> 00:16:53,462
Ah. Is your head screwed on straight?

241
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:55,190
Aw, jeez.

242
00:16:55,905 --> 00:16:58,593
It was hard enough for you to quit the first time around!

243
00:16:58,780 --> 00:16:59,863
I'm serious!

244
00:16:59,888 --> 00:17:01,621
I know you better than you know yourself!

245
00:17:21,837 --> 00:17:22,648
Hey!

246
00:17:39,527 --> 00:17:41,796
"Know thyself" was carved at the gate.

247
00:17:42,537 --> 00:17:43,771
Don't tell me!

248
00:17:59,961 --> 00:18:01,328
Well done!

249
00:18:05,412 --> 00:18:07,895
Wait. Why won't it stop?

250
00:18:08,678 --> 00:18:10,685
Even though you answered correctly.

251
00:18:10,715 --> 00:18:13,053
These friends of yours decided to cheat.

252
00:18:14,113 --> 00:18:16,613
Which means. Uh-oh!

253
00:18:16,638 --> 00:18:18,882
The hidden bomb cannot be stopped!

254
00:18:21,223 --> 00:18:24,157
So, ka-boom!

255
00:18:28,197 --> 00:18:29,405
The hell?

256
00:18:48,091 --> 00:18:50,307
Wait a second. Are those?

257
00:18:50,787 --> 00:18:54,880
Yeah. They're sending out all
of our investigation reports.

258
00:18:57,962 --> 00:19:00,312
Yes sir. The files are authentic.

259
00:19:01,835 --> 00:19:03,554
It's unclear how they broke in.

260
00:19:53,251 --> 00:19:55,731
Hey. Do you wanna destroy it?

261
00:19:55,766 --> 00:19:56,624
Huh?

262
00:19:58,697 --> 00:20:02,108
The entire planet? Do you, like, want to blow it all up?

263
00:20:20,988 --> 00:20:22,363
It's been so long.

264
00:20:22,388 --> 00:20:24,361
I haven't laughed like that in forever.

265
00:20:24,433 --> 00:20:26,461
I forgot how nice it felt.

266
00:20:39,735 --> 00:20:40,718
Ah.

267
00:20:42,685 --> 00:20:43,618
So, uh...

268
00:20:43,643 --> 00:20:44,393
Yeah, no.

269
00:20:47,672 --> 00:20:49,149
Wait! Uh...

270
00:20:49,449 --> 00:20:52,137
Having someone the cops aren't
looking for would be kinda nice...

271
00:20:52,162 --> 00:20:55,330
She can't be trusted. Don't you understand?

272
00:20:55,719 --> 00:20:57,354
We're running out of time, here!

273
00:20:58,757 --> 00:21:00,832
But that doesn't mean that Lisa would...

274
00:21:11,335 --> 00:21:12,032
Huh?
