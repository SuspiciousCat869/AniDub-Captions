[NARRATOR] Madames and
Messieurs. Good evening,

2
00:01:53,833 --> 00:01:56,125
Wishing to express his feelings,

3
00:01:56,208 --> 00:01:58,750
the young man ran
to the opera house,

4
00:01:58,833 --> 00:02:03,458
where his former fiancée
anxiously awaited his arrival.

5
00:02:03,541 --> 00:02:05,333
But he is not yet aware.

6
00:02:05,416 --> 00:02:08,458
Not yet aware of his
father's sordid past,

7
00:02:08,541 --> 00:02:11,666
which lies concealed behind
the broken engagement.

[AUDIENCE clapping]

9
00:02:33,458 --> 00:02:35,791
That man is a
cold blooded murderer!

10
00:02:38,083 --> 00:02:39,541
[MONTE CRISTO]
I am surprised you came

11
00:02:39,625 --> 00:02:40,750
all this way, Your Honor.

12
00:02:40,833 --> 00:02:43,291
Is this spectacle a
sideshow to the opera?

13
00:02:43,375 --> 00:02:45,333
[VILLEFORT]
I take it you recognize this?

14
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:48,541
[MONTE CRISTO]
As I recall, that is the ring

15
00:02:48,625 --> 00:02:50,416
that I gave to your lovely wife.

16
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:53,125
[VILLEFORT]
It had poison hidden inside.

17
00:02:53,208 --> 00:02:54,166
[ALBERT gasps]

18
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:56,375
My, what a
fascinating contraption.

19
00:02:56,458 --> 00:02:58,250
It's apparent to me
that you were attempting

20
00:02:58,333 --> 00:03:00,666
to kill everyone,
including my wife.

21
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:03,916
[MONTE CRISTO] Surely you jest.
Why would I do such a thing?

22
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,208
[VILLEFORT]
It's obvious!

23
00:03:05,291 --> 00:03:07,083
It Is a simple case...

24
00:03:07,166 --> 00:03:09,666
...of that barbaric
custom from Eastern Space

25
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:11,416
commonly known
as the "thrill kill"!

26
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:13,583
No! The Count would
never do anything like that!

27
00:03:13,666 --> 00:03:16,041
Sadly you're being
deceived by that man.

28
00:03:16,125 --> 00:03:17,750
The Count was
the one who told us

29
00:03:17,833 --> 00:03:19,333
about the threat to
Valentine's life!

30
00:03:19,416 --> 00:03:21,625
[MONTE CRISTO] May I assume that
even a foreigner such as myself

31
00:03:21,708 --> 00:03:25,250
can expect to receive a proper
trial in a local court of law?

32
00:03:25,333 --> 00:03:26,708
[VILLEFORT]
Of course.

33
00:03:26,791 --> 00:03:29,500
Under the law, you are
entitled to an impartial trial.

34
00:03:29,583 --> 00:03:32,375
Hearing that sets
my mind at ease.

35
00:03:32,458 --> 00:03:34,958
I have a witness
to offer in my defense.

36
00:03:35,041 --> 00:03:36,291
Witness?

37
00:03:36,375 --> 00:03:38,041
[MONTE CRISTO] Someone who
knows the entire truth

38
00:03:38,125 --> 00:03:39,416
about what happened.

Heloise? No!!

41
00:03:45,833 --> 00:03:47,708
[MONTE CRISTO] I must tell
you that I have heard

42
00:03:47,791 --> 00:03:51,708
many fascinating stories
from Madame and your son.

43
00:03:51,791 --> 00:03:52,791
Including a few tales

44
00:03:52,875 --> 00:03:55,416
which touch upon
certain family affairs.

45

You bastard!

46
00:03:57,208 --> 00:04:00,250
So, your Honor, what is it
you would like to do with me?

00:04:07,375 --> 00:04:09,000
[ONLOOKER B] I thought they
were gonna arrest that guy.

00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:10,541
[MONTE CRISTO]
Not to worry, gentlemen.

52
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:13,750
It seems that His Honor the
Crown Prosecutor made a mistake.

53
00:04:13,833 --> 00:04:15,583
[ONLOOKER C]
Yeah! Way to go, Count!

54
00:04:15,666 --> 00:04:18,208
Nice to see that

I think it would be best

for you to return
to your home now.

But Count...

Thank you Albert, but
you needn't worry about me.

on ruining me.

I can't believe it!

You're still saying
that nonsense?

I can sense it.

Please call me Andrea.

[EUGENIE] I don't know what
my father said to you,

but I don't feel the
least bit grateful to you,

00:05:12,166 --> 00:05:12,958
is that clear?

Now, now, Eugenie...

It's always been my dream

76

to play a concert
at the opera house,

77
00:05:18,166 --> 00:05:20,375
but using money to make
that dream come true was--

78
00:05:20,458 --> 00:05:22,250
[ANDREA] But Eugenie,
it was your own merit

79
00:05:22,333 --> 00:05:25,083
that won you the
right to that concert.

80
00:05:25,166 --> 00:05:27,583
The reason, of course, is
that your magnificent talent

has utterly transformed me into
your loyal and humble servant.

even have the courage

Considering the Royal

[DEBRAY] The General Security

what to do with her.

since she was out in the night

air at the party in Auteuil
and caught a terrible cold.

So anyway, that's why I can't
offer you a suitable welcome,

00:08:59,666 --> 00:09:01,541
I would be honored if you did!

158
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:03,583
Oh wait...

159
00:09:03,666 --> 00:09:05,083
[DANGLARS]
Hm?

160
00:09:07,375 --> 00:09:10,166
You're inside on
Black Hole futures?!

161
00:09:10,666 --> 00:09:14,833
[DANGLARS] Now, then, let's get
down to business, Michelle!

162
00:09:14,916 --> 00:09:16,666
[MICHELLE] General Morcerf
called wishing to make

163
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:18,041
an appointment to see you.

164
00:09:18,125 --> 00:09:19,916
[DANGLARS]
No! No! Never mind that!

165
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,041
I want the ultra-high density
materials market report!

166
00:09:23,125 --> 00:09:24,250
Now, get to it!

167
00:09:24,333 --> 00:09:26,041
[MICHELLE]
Understood, Monsieur.

168
00:09:28,791 --> 00:09:30,916
[BERTUCCIO] Danglars is
accessing the market!

169
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,958
[MONTE CRISTO]
Excellent. It's time to sell.

170
00:09:33,041 --> 00:09:34,208
Understood!

00:09:34,291 --> 00:09:36,541
[MONTE CRISTO]
Let him gleefully eat his fill.

172
00:09:36,625 --> 00:09:37,875
We'll make sure
that he's properly

and then leak intel that there

175
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:46,166
is an impending Imperial Forces
offensive in the Central Galaxy.

176
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:47,916
Still, the thought
of helping to line

177
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
that vulture's pockets is
more than a little distasteful.

178
00:09:54,041 --> 00:09:56,416
[DEBRAY]
Gankutsuou, huh?

179
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,125
Are you ready to start?

180
00:09:58,208 --> 00:09:59,750

Mm-hm.

Please be quiet.

00:10:43,041 --> 00:10:45,916
[SHADOW A] Gankutsuou is
the king of the shadows.

Which means?

195
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:48,666
[SHADOW B] Nobody's ever
seen what he looks like.

196
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:50,791
His name should never be spoken.

197
00:10:50,875 --> 00:10:54,166
Those who break that taboo
meet a fate worse than death.

198
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:55,791
Some kind of urban legend?

199
00:10:55,875 --> 00:10:57,375
[SHADOW C]
It is the truth.

200
00:10:57,458 --> 00:11:00,791
He appeared on the fringes of
the galaxy a thousand years ago

201
00:11:00,875 --> 00:11:04,625
and tried to gain control
of the criminal underworld.

202
00:11:04,708 --> 00:11:06,458
He's an invader?

203
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:08,541
[SHADOW D]
Gankutsuou is invincible.

204
00:11:08,625 --> 00:11:11,875
He controls people by
manipulating their desires.

205
00:11:11,958 --> 00:11:14,541
However, he was
defeated by fate.

206
00:11:14,625 --> 00:11:18,250
In June of 4002 of the
Louis Philippe calendar,

207
00:11:18,333 --> 00:11:20,666
he was apprehended
and incarcerated.

208
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:22,916
[FRANZ]
Incarcerated? Where?

209
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,541
[SHADOW A]
We cannot answer that.

210

I hereby invoke

213
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:35,208
[SHADOW A]
Gankutsuou was imprisoned

214
00:11:35,291 --> 00:11:37,458
in the dungeons of Chateau d'If.

215
00:11:37,541 --> 00:11:39,750
[DEBRAY]
I see. What happened after that?

216
00:11:39,833 --> 00:11:41,041
[SHADOW D]
His death was confirmed

217
00:11:41,125 --> 00:11:45,125
in the late afternoon
of December 23, 5043.

218
00:11:45,208 --> 00:11:46,708
Ten years ago?!

219
00:11:46,791 --> 00:11:49,041
He was in prison
for a thousand years?!

220
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:51,000
What name was he
imprisoned under?

221
00:11:51,083 --> 00:11:53,208
[SHADOW A]
The Man in the Iron Mask.

No, I don't "want"
to I have to know!

234
00:12:43,666 --> 00:12:46,125
Well, I wonder if
old man Noirtier might know.

235
00:12:46,208 --> 00:12:47,541
Why would he?

236
00:12:47,625 --> 00:12:50,416
A long time ago, he ran
the Ministry of the Interior.

237
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,833
But he also had
quite a few enemies,

238
00:12:52,916 --> 00:12:54,041
and he was brought down.

239
00:12:54,125 --> 00:12:56,583
You mean the assassination
of the Prince?

240
00:12:57,666 --> 00:13:01,041
He was a very vocal proponent
of making peace with the Empire.

241
00:13:01,125 --> 00:13:02,750
Apparently, that
made it quite hard

242
00:13:02,833 --> 00:13:04,791
for his son,
Villefort, to advance.

243
00:13:04,875 --> 00:13:08,125
Of course all that work
has been for naught.

his status and his family.

00:13:20,333 --> 00:13:22,833
Poetic justice for a man
who's spent his career

248
00:13:22,916 --> 00:13:24,666
sending innocent
men to prison

249
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:28,625
and presiding over so many
cold and merciless trials.

250
00:13:28,708 --> 00:13:31,000
I know you think that this is
my punishment for defying

251
00:13:31,083 --> 00:13:34,208
your wishes and supporting
war against the Empire

252
00:13:34,291 --> 00:13:36,291
and for doing away
with your compatriots.

253
00:13:36,375 --> 00:13:38,875
Do you know how long and
hard I worked to surpass you!

You who had the power
to sway government policy!

Do you have the slightest idea
how hard that was for me?!

Any idea of how hard
it was to be your son

in a world completely
dominated by Hawks?!

00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:55,708
So what?!

00:13:55,791 --> 00:13:57,166
See if I care!

261
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:58,958
I won't let it end like this!

00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:02,083
I'll come back from this

be stronger than ever!

We can still attack after
the peace negotiations.

We should strike

If we are to gain the upper
hand at the negotiation table,

What may we do for you?

278
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:18,458
Actually, I was hoping
I could meet with the Count.

279
00:15:18,833 --> 00:15:21,666
I'm afraid the Count's illness
has rendered him bedridden.

280
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:23,583
Yes, I'd heard that.

281
00:15:23,666 --> 00:15:27,000
Please, let me wish
him a speedy recovery.

282
00:15:27,083 --> 00:15:30,416
I ask that you allow him
to remain undisturbed.

283
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,041
At trying times like this,

284
00:15:32,125 --> 00:15:34,875
he will see no one else
in the world but me.

285
00:15:34,958 --> 00:15:36,416
Of course, Mademoiselle.

286
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:39,833
The Count has complete
faith in you, doesn't he?

287
00:15:41,458 --> 00:15:44,333
Please tell him to be on guard
against Monsieur Villefort.

288
00:15:44,416 --> 00:15:46,041
Villefort said that
he was gonna make

289
00:15:46,125 --> 00:15:48,083
the Count pay
for whatever he did.

290
00:15:48,166 --> 00:15:49,166
So he--

291
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:51,166
Monsieur Albert,
you care a great deal

292
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:53,083
for the Count, don't you?

293
00:15:53,166 --> 00:15:56,375
Yes, I suppose...

294
00:15:58,208 --> 00:16:00,875
I'm glad that you are
concerned for his well-being.

295
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:04,583
I'm curious Mademoiselle,
how long have you been with him?

296
00:16:04,666 --> 00:16:08,500
Well, It's been a long time now.

297
00:16:08,583 --> 00:16:11,958
A long time since the Count
decided he would purchase me.

298
00:16:12,041 --> 00:16:14,083
He... bought you?!

299
00:16:14,166 --> 00:16:16,583
[HAIDEE] Please understand,
I was born into

300
00:16:16,666 --> 00:16:20,041
the royal family of a
certain frontier planet.

301
00:16:20,125 --> 00:16:24,208
Our world is situated between
this kingdom and Eastern Space,

302
00:16:24,291 --> 00:16:26,875
and had prospered from
the trade between them.

303
00:16:26,958 --> 00:16:28,458
However...

304
00:16:28,541 --> 00:16:33,250
...our excellent fortune was not
destined to last for very long.

305
00:16:33,333 --> 00:16:36,208
War broke out between
the Empire and Earth,

306
00:16:36,291 --> 00:16:37,708
and my home world was engulfed

307
00:16:37,791 --> 00:16:40,125
in the terrible
flames of battle.

308
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:44,125
My father decided to establish
an alliance with the Earth.

309
00:16:44,208 --> 00:16:45,666
He did this because he had heard

310
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:49,208
that the people of Earth
valued freedom above all else.

311
00:16:50,416 --> 00:16:54,916
Soon after, reinforcements
arrived from Earth.

312
00:16:55,666 --> 00:16:57,500
[ALBERT] My father told
me that ten years ago

313
00:16:57,583 --> 00:16:59,416
was a time of great turmoil.

314
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:00,875
He said that he
himself had fought

315
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:03,625
in several wars of independence.

316
00:17:05,916 --> 00:17:08,333
The reinforcements from
Earth broke the alliance

317
00:17:08,416 --> 00:17:11,291
and betrayed my father!

318
00:17:12,125 --> 00:17:13,416
[HAIDEE]
They started a rebellion,

319
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,916
leveling false charges
against my father,

320
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,875
claiming that he was working
in collusion with the Empire.

321
00:17:19,958 --> 00:17:22,625
My father was eventually
killed as a traitor.

322
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:24,666
My mother and I were
stripped of our property

323
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:28,708
and position and sold into
the hands of our enemies.

324
00:17:28,791 --> 00:17:31,250
My mother died soon thereafter,

325
00:17:31,333 --> 00:17:33,708
and I was left
to fend for myself.

326
00:17:34,791 --> 00:17:38,208
I was like a walking corpse.

327
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:46,458
Until, until the day
that I met the Count.

328
00:18:22,708 --> 00:18:24,000
[ALBERT]
I'm sorry.

329
00:18:24,083 --> 00:18:27,625
I didn't mean to dredge
up painful memories.

330
00:18:27,708 --> 00:18:30,625
I'm a fool, aren't I?

331
00:18:30,708 --> 00:18:33,000
My girlfriend tells
me that all the time.

332
00:18:33,083 --> 00:18:35,583
She says I don't think
about other people's feelings.

333
00:18:35,666 --> 00:18:37,000
Oh, I guess she's more like

334
00:18:37,083 --> 00:18:39,166
an old childhood
friend than a girlfriend.

335
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:42,166
She gave a piano recital at
the opera house the other day!

336
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:46,625
"It's wonderful to be able
to express yourself that way."

337
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:50,583
That's what I thought to myself
when I heard her performance.

338
00:18:50,666 --> 00:18:54,125
Mademoiselle, you're quite
good at the harp, right?

339
00:18:56,125 --> 00:18:58,791
Do my family the honor of
paying us a visit sometime.

340
00:18:58,875 --> 00:19:00,291
And perhaps you
would even allow me

341
00:19:00,375 --> 00:19:02,916
to introduce you
to some of my friends.

342
00:19:03,875 --> 00:19:06,458
[HAIDEE]
The night we arrived in Paris...

343
00:19:06,541 --> 00:19:09,833
...the Count took me aside
said the following to me:

344
00:19:09,916 --> 00:19:12,666
"Haidee, this is
a land where freedom

345
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:14,791
and human rights
are appreciated."

346
00:19:14,875 --> 00:19:16,625
"Therefore you
should do as you wish,

347
00:19:16,708 --> 00:19:20,000
acting according to
your own free will." So...

348
00:19:20,083 --> 00:19:23,125
This is the way
that I see it now.

349
00:19:23,208 --> 00:19:27,208
If I remain voluntarily,
I am here because I'm free,

350
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:30,041
and I freely choose to do so.

351
00:19:47,416 --> 00:19:50,666
[ANDREA] Our young Viscount
is one carefree kid.

352
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:54,000
Even though there's a fire
lit under his old man's ass.

353
00:19:54,083 --> 00:19:55,333
Oh, stop it.

354
00:19:55,416 --> 00:19:56,958
[ANDREA]
"It's wonderful to be able

355
00:19:57,041 --> 00:20:00,791
to express yourself that way."
Ha! I'm gonna puke!

356
00:20:00,875 --> 00:20:03,291
That is so damn pathetic!

357
00:20:03,375 --> 00:20:06,041
But then you and I are
two of a kind, aren't we?

358
00:20:06,125 --> 00:20:09,125
I can see what you
really think, plain as day.

359
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:11,208
No! Please, you're wrong!

360
00:20:11,291 --> 00:20:12,791
You hate him, don't you?!

361
00:20:12,875 --> 00:20:15,166
You wanna rip him
to pieces, don't you?!

362
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:17,083
Come on, let's have some fun.

363
00:20:17,166 --> 00:20:19,000
[MONTE CRISTO]
Take your hands off her!

364
00:20:23,583 --> 00:20:25,708
[ANDREA cackling]
It's the Count...

365
00:20:27,208 --> 00:20:29,500
[MONTE CRISTO, FARIA]
Leave us!

366
00:20:31,208 --> 00:20:34,583
[ANDREA]
As you wish Excellency.

367
00:20:44,208 --> 00:20:46,833
Monsieur Villefort? I think.

368
00:20:48,125 --> 00:20:50,750
[HAIDEE] After I met
you, I cast away all of

369
00:20:50,833 --> 00:20:54,083
the horrible feelings
I had within myself.

370
00:20:54,166 --> 00:20:56,875
Or so I believed.

371
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,875
And I thought if
I could only ease

372
00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:03,875
your cruel resolve then
everything would be all right...

373
00:21:03,958 --> 00:21:06,250
But I... But I just...

374
00:21:06,333 --> 00:21:09,333
...I just couldn't forget
what was burned in my mind.

375
00:21:09,416 --> 00:21:12,708
I couldn't forget how
I felt when I swore revenge.

376
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,333
[HAIDEE]
Considering how I myself feel,

377
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:20,041
it was very wrong of me to
hope to change how you feel.

378
00:21:20,125 --> 00:21:22,000
I'm so sorry...

379
00:21:30,625 --> 00:21:32,666
[VILLEFORT]
Ah, Count.

380
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:34,583
I'm afraid I caused
you to suffer

381
00:21:34,666 --> 00:21:36,083
a great injustice by jumping

382
00:21:36,166 --> 00:21:38,750
to some rather
regrettable conclusions.

383
00:21:38,833 --> 00:21:42,125
Please, let me offer
you my apology!

384
00:21:42,208 --> 00:21:43,375
Eat this!

385
00:21:43,458 --> 00:21:45,291
Count! No!

386
00:23:28,916 --> 00:23:30,958
[ALBERT] The person I
was in the past is not

387
00:23:31,041 --> 00:23:32,250
the person I am today.

388
00:23:32,333 --> 00:23:35,458
Who we were in the past
is not who we are today.

389
00:23:35,541 --> 00:23:38,666
Next Gankutsuou, The Count
of Monte Cristo, Act 14:

390
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:40,125
"Lost Souls".

391
00:23:40,208 --> 00:23:42,083
Bide your time,
and hold out hope!
