165

I want you to leave now.

166
00:11:12,041 --> 00:11:13,500
Huh?

167
00:11:14,416 --> 00:11:17,750
No one... No one ever
considers what I want.

168
00:11:18,541 --> 00:11:20,708
Valantine, I...

169
00:11:20,791 --> 00:11:23,750
[Valantine crying]
Just go away!

170
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,625
[VILLEFORT] I will
now pass judgment.

171
00:11:33,708 --> 00:11:36,125
Defendant is found
guilty of larceny

172
00:11:36,208 --> 00:11:38,250
and insulting the aristocracy,

173
00:11:38,333 --> 00:11:39,875
the sentence is death.

174
00:11:39,958 --> 00:11:42,208
But there were
mitigating issues!

175
00:11:42,291 --> 00:11:44,708
You'll get no
sympathy from me!

176
00:11:46,666 --> 00:11:50,708
It's human trash like this
man that ruins the kingdom...

177

[GUARD]
You have a visitor.

178
00:12:11,541 --> 00:12:15,000
[BAPTISTIN] So, you
miss the outside world?

179
00:12:18,166 --> 00:12:21,000
[VICTORIA] So, Heloise, are you
getting along with Valantine?

180
00:12:21,083 --> 00:12:22,375
Eh?

181
00:12:22,458 --> 00:12:25,833
I had heard that you had
taken to beating her severely.

182
00:12:25,916 --> 00:12:28,541
I what? Who on
earth said that?!

183
00:12:28,625 --> 00:12:30,791
It's just a rumor.

184
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:32,500
I like to think
that I'm as attentive

185
00:12:32,583 --> 00:12:34,541
as I can be to that girl.

186
00:12:34,625 --> 00:12:37,666
Just because she's the
daughter of his old wife

187
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:40,041
it doesn't mean that I--

a little bit too fast?

[COACHMAN]
It's not me, Madame!

190
00:12:47,666 --> 00:12:49,583
The horses! They...

191
00:12:49,666 --> 00:12:52,250
They're refusing to obey me!

[horse whinnies]

196
00:13:19,041 --> 00:13:21,250
[MONTE CRISTO] You are
not harmed, I trust?

197
00:13:22,833 --> 00:13:26,416
Look, it's the
Count of Monte Cristo!

198
00:13:28,958 --> 00:13:32,250
We have you to thank
for our lives, sir.

199
00:13:32,333 --> 00:13:34,833
It was fortunate
indeed that I had on hand

200
00:13:34,916 --> 00:13:38,000
one who is skilled in
the handling of horses.

201
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:39,083
You look weird!

202
00:13:39,166 --> 00:13:42,666
Are you some kind of alien?

203
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:45,666
[Heloise] Edouard,
don't be such a rascal!

204
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:49,083
Curiosity is a sure
sign of intelligence.

205
00:13:49,875 --> 00:13:51,875
We still don't
know your name...

206
00:13:51,958 --> 00:13:55,375
[VICTORIA] Heloise, this is
the Count of Monte Cristo.

207
00:13:55,458 --> 00:13:58,708
You know, dear, he and my
husband are practically family.

208
00:13:59,833 --> 00:14:01,208
I heard something
about you buying

209
00:14:01,291 --> 00:14:04,000
the late Prince's
booth at the opera...

210
00:14:04,083 --> 00:14:06,208
Then I am embarrassed.

211
00:14:06,291 --> 00:14:09,791
It is not my custom to attract
undue attention to myself

212
00:14:09,875 --> 00:14:11,916
but there were no
other seats available.

213
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,958
May I introduce
Madame Heloise,

wife of Crown
Prosecutor Villefort.

215
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:20,708
Madam, you are the wife
of Paris' guardian angel.

216
00:14:21,583 --> 00:14:23,458
You're quite
the flatterer.

217
00:14:26,083 --> 00:14:28,750
Your horses still
seem to be agitated.

Please, allow us to
escort you to your homes.

219
00:14:33,166 --> 00:14:37,333
If Madame Villefort is amenable,
I shall see to it myself.

220
00:14:42,375 --> 00:14:44,750
[ALBERT] It's just, I've never
seen her like that before.

Valantine, dear!
We have a visitor!

231
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:19,208
Mademoiselle says
that she is feeling unwell

232
00:15:19,291 --> 00:15:21,000
and wishes not
to be disturbed.

233
00:15:21,083 --> 00:15:23,500
Honestly, that girl...

234
00:15:23,583 --> 00:15:25,166
Now Valantine!

235
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:27,916
Can't you even come out
and say hello to our guest?!

236
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,625
Valantine!

237
00:15:31,125 --> 00:15:34,291
It's obvious that
she's utterly miserable.

238
00:15:34,375 --> 00:15:36,583
Yeah, maybe...

239
00:15:36,666 --> 00:15:38,166
I can see it
in her face.

240
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:40,208
Deep down, her
heart yearns for freedom.

241
00:15:40,291 --> 00:15:42,583
But she is averting her eyes
away from those feelings

242
00:15:42,666 --> 00:15:45,125
and hiding
beneath her sorrow.

243
00:15:45,208 --> 00:15:46,625
You might be right.

244
00:15:46,708 --> 00:15:48,916
She is a delicate
and fragile woman!

245
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,208
Can't you hear her soul
desperately crying out?!

246
00:15:52,291 --> 00:15:54,250
Yeah, I can hear it.

247
00:15:54,333 --> 00:15:56,375
No one considers
what she wants.

248
00:15:56,458 --> 00:15:58,708
I don't. Nor you.

249
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:01,333
None of us really do.

250
00:16:04,041 --> 00:16:06,375
[Heloise] Oh, that girl.
She always goes out of her way

251
00:16:06,458 --> 00:16:08,125
to make trouble for me.

252
00:16:08,208 --> 00:16:10,250
Perhaps she gets it
from her late mother.

253
00:16:10,333 --> 00:16:13,500
She's always sickly and
stays cooped up indoors.

254
00:16:13,583 --> 00:16:15,500
I've tried everything
I can think of,

255
00:16:15,583 --> 00:16:19,333
to raise her to be a more
sociable person... but...

256
00:16:19,708 --> 00:16:20,958
She's gonna
die young.

257
00:16:21,041 --> 00:16:22,541
Isn't that what
you said, Mama?

I feel sorry for
my own child, too.

Valantine stands to
inherit the fortune

Noirtier, as well has that

263
00:16:36,083 --> 00:16:39,000
of the Marquis Saint-Meran
on her mother's side.

264
00:16:39,083 --> 00:16:42,166
But this boy
will receive nothing.

00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:43,958
That saddens me.

266
00:16:44,041 --> 00:16:46,208
I think siblings should
be equally fortunate,

even if they are totally
unrelated by blood.

I know it might
sound a bit pathetic

but these flowers

It seems that everyone
of your favorite flowers,

share the same
fascinating trait.

Oh? What trait?

[MAXIMILIEN]
Hey!

298
00:18:14,708 --> 00:18:16,875
[HELOISE] My love of
horticulture eventually grew

299
00:18:16,958 --> 00:18:18,833
into an interest
in botany.

300
00:18:18,916 --> 00:18:21,666
It's not really a
women's subject is it?

301
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:23,375
Could it be...

302
00:18:23,458 --> 00:18:26,666
...that you also have
an interest in toxicology?

303
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:29,791
Of course not.
Such a horrible thing,

304
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:32,875
Horrible?
Why horrible?

305
00:18:32,958 --> 00:18:36,666
Toxicology and pharmacology
are two sides of the same coin.

Also...

307
00:18:37,875 --> 00:18:39,750
...nothing is more
enticing to human beings

than the mysteries of poison.

Am I mistaken?

310
00:18:44,166 --> 00:18:47,916
Poisons that steal a man's
life away in an instant.

311

Poisons that kill slowly

and then leave no
trace of themselves.

313
00:18:53,291 --> 00:18:55,708
One starts to wonder
how many poisonings

00:18:55,791 --> 00:18:59,625
have been consigned to the
darkness, known but to the dead.

315

And one more thing.

316

There is a beauty to
those bewitched by poisons.

referred to as
a Borgia Ring.

Take it. Now, press on the
stone and see what happens.

00:19:24,916 --> 00:19:28,041
It is said that Lucrezia Borgia
used rings just like these

323
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:32,208
to dispatch countless people
throughout her diabolical life.

324
00:19:32,291 --> 00:19:37,083
And foremost among her
victims was her own husband.

325
00:19:37,166 --> 00:19:41,333
That ring belongs
to you, a gift Madame.

326
00:19:41,416 --> 00:19:42,750
I'm so happy...

327
00:19:42,833 --> 00:19:45,083
It is nothing, a mere
getting-acquainted gift

328
00:19:45,166 --> 00:19:46,708
from a new friend.

329
00:20:07,208 --> 00:20:09,000
Oh, Grandfather...

330
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:15,916
I want... I want to go
somewhere far away.

331
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:20,333
To some faraway place
where no one knows who I am.

332
00:20:33,875 --> 00:20:36,375
[FRANZ]
It's nothing but trouble.

333
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:46,458
Benedetto! Take a look
out the left window.

334
00:20:46,541 --> 00:20:49,541
That's Viscount
Albert de Morcerf.

335
00:23:28,916 --> 00:23:30,541
[ALBERT] A party at
the Count's villa.

336
00:23:30,625 --> 00:23:34,750
In the labyrinth, we cross paths
with a beautiful, horrible past.

337
00:23:34,833 --> 00:23:37,833
Next Gankutsuou,
The Count of Monte Cristo,

338
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:40,208
Act 8: "A Night in Boulogne."

339
00:23:40,291 --> 00:23:42,250
Bide your time,
and hold out hope!
