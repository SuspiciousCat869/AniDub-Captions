[FARIA] Madams and Messieurs,
good evening.

00:01:53,916 --> 00:01:56,375
The youth, who had
been ravaged by poison,

3
00:01:56,458 --> 00:02:00,041
was restored to life
through my friend's efforts.

4
00:02:00,125 --> 00:02:03,208
However, my friend
said something to me.

5
00:02:03,291 --> 00:02:06,625
I will not yet let
his soul be lost.

6
00:02:06,708 --> 00:02:11,208
Not until the day that he
himself snuffs out that light.

00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:47,458
[MAXIMILIEN]
Monsieur Albert.

8
00:03:03,333 --> 00:03:05,166
[ALBERT] Have you
managed to get any sleep?

9
00:03:07,333 --> 00:03:09,541
If there is one thing
I have confidence in,

10
00:03:09,625 --> 00:03:10,750
it's my stamina.

11
00:03:10,833 --> 00:03:13,833
That may be so but
you look like hell to me.

12
00:03:14,583 --> 00:03:16,125
It looks like Monsieur
Villefort has laid off

13
00:03:16,208 --> 00:03:17,958
all of the maids
and butlers.

14
00:03:18,041 --> 00:03:20,250
Yes, I heard.

15
00:03:21,083 --> 00:03:23,416
After all that's happened
I just can't bring myself

16
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,833
to leave her alone
in this house.

17
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:28,791
Besides, I've
been thinking about

18
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:30,458
something that Franz said.

19
00:03:30,541 --> 00:03:33,583
Getting married isn't
necessarily the only way

20
00:03:33,666 --> 00:03:36,416
there is to make the person
you love happy and content.

21
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:38,291
And so, I've been
mulling it over.

22
00:03:38,375 --> 00:03:40,208
Trying to figure out
the most important thing

23
00:03:40,291 --> 00:03:42,333
that Mademoiselle
Valantine needs.

24
00:03:42,416 --> 00:03:44,708
So I can give it to her.

25
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:47,000
And what do
you think that is?

26
00:03:47,791 --> 00:03:49,416
She may be asleep now,

27
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:52,458
but I think that Mademoiselle
Valantine is lonely

28
00:03:52,541 --> 00:03:54,416
to the point of crying.

29
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,625
So, at the very least,
I want to make sure

30
00:03:56,708 --> 00:03:58,916
that I'm sitting
right by her side

31
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,333
when she finally
comes around.

32
00:04:01,416 --> 00:04:03,666
Which is why I
made up my mind.

33
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:07,875
I'm taking her to Marseilles to
our family home to recuperate.

34
00:04:07,958 --> 00:04:09,083
I don't want her to have

35
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:11,750
to endure any more
pain or suffering.

36
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:19,333
I had a feeling you'd be here.

37
00:04:19,416 --> 00:04:21,791
Your Honor, I came
here today to discuss--

38
00:04:21,875 --> 00:04:23,416
Mark my words, boy.

39
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:24,625
If you dare try to take

40
00:04:24,708 --> 00:04:26,916
my daughter even a
foot from this house.

41
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,375
I'll have you hunted down
and arrested as a kidnapper.

42
00:04:30,458 --> 00:04:32,125
That is not a threat.

43
00:04:32,208 --> 00:04:33,500
But, Your Honor,
the things

44
00:04:33,583 --> 00:04:34,708
that are happening
in this house are--

45
00:04:34,791 --> 00:04:37,833
Are none of your business!
Now, get out!

46
00:04:37,916 --> 00:04:40,333
You, too, Albert.
I want you out.

47
00:04:40,416 --> 00:04:42,500
Begging your pardon, Your Honor,
but somebody out there

48
00:04:42,583 --> 00:04:45,208
is trying very hard to
kill off your whole family!

49
00:04:45,291 --> 00:04:46,875
I was almost
killed myself.

50
00:04:46,958 --> 00:04:48,583
"Somebody," is
trying to kill us?

51
00:04:48,666 --> 00:04:49,958
If there's
anyone close at hand

52
00:04:50,041 --> 00:04:52,208
who could be described
as suspicious, it would be

53
00:04:52,291 --> 00:04:54,958
that impudent fraud of a Count
whom you call your friend!

54
00:04:55,041 --> 00:04:56,250
Be clear!

55
00:04:56,333 --> 00:04:59,125
From now on, this is
strictly a family affair!

56
00:04:59,208 --> 00:05:02,208
I forbid you from
interfering with us!

[BOVILLE whispering]
The following is a report

58
00:05:08,958 --> 00:05:12,000
regarding my investigation on
the Count of Monte Cristo.

59
00:05:12,083 --> 00:05:14,125
In the course of visiting
the various locations

60
00:05:14,208 --> 00:05:17,500
indicated by Your Honor,
I discovered quite by accident

61
00:05:17,583 --> 00:05:20,166
that a certain old priest
had been making a similar set

62
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:23,875
of inquiries all
around Marseilles.

63
00:05:23,958 --> 00:05:25,625
He has visited this
area several times

64
00:05:25,708 --> 00:05:27,375
during the past three months,

65
00:05:27,458 --> 00:05:29,291
always asking questions.

66
00:05:29,375 --> 00:05:31,375
The priest seems to
be gathering information

67
00:05:31,458 --> 00:05:34,375
on an old man who
lived here some time ago

68
00:05:34,458 --> 00:05:37,375
and died penniless and alone.

69
00:05:37,458 --> 00:05:41,083
The old man's name
was Louis Dantes.

70
00:05:41,166 --> 00:05:44,041
In order to ascertain the
priest's true objectives,

71
00:05:44,125 --> 00:05:46,500
as well as to clarify the
connection between him

72
00:05:46,583 --> 00:05:48,291
and the Count of Monte Cristo...

73
00:05:48,375 --> 00:05:51,375
I plan to investigate the house
that Louis Dantes lived in

74
00:05:51,458 --> 00:05:53,333
while he was still alive.

75
00:05:55,333 --> 00:05:59,458

but there's still so
much I don't understand.

to poke your nose into another
family's private affairs?

162
00:10:12,541 --> 00:10:13,583
What do you mean, why?

163
00:10:13,666 --> 00:10:14,791
My friend is...

164
00:10:14,875 --> 00:10:16,416
Neither you nor your
friend have any right

165
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:19,500
to throw someone else's house
into turmoil on a foolish whim!

166
00:10:19,583 --> 00:10:20,708
How can you say that?!

167
00:10:20,791 --> 00:10:22,375
You have no idea
what's going on!

168
00:10:22,458 --> 00:10:24,041
If we don't do something...

169
00:10:24,125 --> 00:10:25,541
My answer is no!

170
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,541
I don't want you
involved any further!

171
00:10:27,625 --> 00:10:29,041
What are you so angry about?!

172
00:10:29,125 --> 00:10:30,500
My friend is in
terrible trouble,

173
00:10:30,583 --> 00:10:33,500
and you're telling me to just
walk away and abandon her?!

174
00:10:33,583 --> 00:10:34,583
Forget it.

175
00:10:34,666 --> 00:10:37,375
It was stupid of me
to even ask.

176
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,416
What's the matter, Albert?

177
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:01,333
You look upset.

178
00:11:02,333 --> 00:11:04,875
I got into a shouting
match with Father, that's all.

179
00:11:04,958 --> 00:11:07,416
Oh.

180
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,291
Mother, do you know someone

181
00:11:08,375 --> 00:11:10,583
by the name of Edmond Dantes?

182
00:11:12,875 --> 00:11:15,291
Did you say
Edmond Dantes?

183
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:16,875
Yeah.

184
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:19,875
That was the name on a letter
that came in for Father today.

185
00:11:19,958 --> 00:11:21,250
The instant Father
saw that name,

186
00:11:21,333 --> 00:11:24,875
he started acting
strangely so I was curious.

187
00:11:30,041 --> 00:11:31,000
What's the matter?

188
00:11:31,083 --> 00:11:32,625
Oh, it's really nothing.

189
00:11:32,708 --> 00:11:35,583
I haven't been sleeping
well lately, that's all.

190
00:11:35,666 --> 00:11:37,833
I guess with the big
election almost here,

191
00:11:37,916 --> 00:11:39,750
you must be
really tired, too.

192
00:11:39,833 --> 00:11:42,333
Yes, I suppose
that might be it.

193
00:11:42,416 --> 00:11:44,833
You should take it easy.

194
00:11:47,416 --> 00:11:48,791
[ALBERT thinking]
Who is he?

195
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:51,208
Who is "Edmond Dantes"?

196
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,166
[MERCEDES thinking]
That man long dead...

197
00:12:25,125 --> 00:12:26,583
[ALBERT] What could
possibly be worth...

198
00:12:26,666 --> 00:12:28,916
...coming all the
way out here for?

199
00:12:51,125 --> 00:12:53,416
Hmph, damn!

200
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:58,291
I guess this means you were
sent one of these, as well.

201
00:12:58,375 --> 00:12:59,583
Who's behind this?

202
00:12:59,666 --> 00:13:00,625
I don't know.

203
00:13:00,708 --> 00:13:02,458
I say it's just
a stupid prank.

204
00:13:02,541 --> 00:13:04,833
I think we should
all get out of here.

205
00:13:04,916 --> 00:13:06,625
But why would
they send for us?

206
00:13:06,708 --> 00:13:10,083
Who ever it is knows about
the connection between us.

207
00:13:15,833 --> 00:13:19,500
Well, well, well
the gang's all here...

208
00:13:22,833 --> 00:13:25,291
Just who
the hell are you?

209
00:13:31,291 --> 00:13:35,208
[MAN laughs]

210
00:13:35,291 --> 00:13:36,833
Wait I know you!

211
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:37,791
That's right.

212
00:13:37,875 --> 00:13:40,125
I'm your old
friend Caderousse.

213
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:42,458
Now that you've
made it big,

214
00:13:42,541 --> 00:13:43,791
have you forgotten
about me along

215
00:13:43,875 --> 00:13:46,166
with all those
unpleasant memories?

216
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:49,083
I see you're all big,
powerful men now,

217
00:13:49,166 --> 00:13:51,500
not at all like
in the old days!

218
00:13:51,583 --> 00:13:54,166
So, you're the one who's
behind all this, Caderousse?

219
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:56,166
What kind of
stupid stunt is this?!

220
00:13:56,250 --> 00:14:00,291
But don't you see I've been sent
one of these invitations too!

221
00:14:00,375 --> 00:14:01,875
Just like you. Look!

222
00:14:01,958 --> 00:14:03,541
Huh?

223
00:14:06,666 --> 00:14:08,166
Who could've sent these?

224
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:10,958
[VILLEFORT] It would seem that
someone else must know about us.

225
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:16,458
[ALBERT thinking]
What's going on here?

226
00:14:16,541 --> 00:14:18,833
I wonder...

227
00:14:18,916 --> 00:14:20,708
[CADEROUSSE] You're
asking me who else knows

228
00:14:20,791 --> 00:14:26,041
the connection we all have,
besides the four of us?

229
00:14:26,125 --> 00:14:28,250
Only the man
who signed this.

230
00:14:31,083 --> 00:14:33,000
You're talking about
Edmond Dantes?

231
00:14:33,083 --> 00:14:35,000
But he was sent
to Chateau d'If...

232
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:37,250
Yes, and he died.

233
00:14:37,333 --> 00:14:40,250
The dead man has once
again come back to us!

234
00:14:40,333 --> 00:14:43,000
Edmond would never
forget what we did to him.

235
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:45,791
Even from beyond
the grave.

236
00:14:45,875 --> 00:14:50,916
He would never forget what
we did, not in a million years.

237
00:14:53,958 --> 00:14:55,833
Whose body is in here, then?

238
00:14:55,916 --> 00:14:58,041
Whose body is lying
there in that coffin?!

239
00:14:58,125 --> 00:14:59,541
I don't understand!

240
00:15:04,333 --> 00:15:05,583
Open it right now!!

241
00:15:05,666 --> 00:15:08,250
No! No please!

242
00:15:08,333 --> 00:15:09,666
Please I don't want to!

243
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:11,375
Stop whimpering and open it!

244
00:15:11,458 --> 00:15:12,916
Please don't make me! Please!!

245
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:13,583
Go on!

246
00:15:13,666 --> 00:15:15,708
Hurry up and do it!

247
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:03,041
Oh...! Boville...!

248
00:16:20,583 --> 00:16:22,541
Come on! This way! Hurry!

249
00:16:24,333 --> 00:16:25,375
Do you really think it's okay

250
00:16:25,458 --> 00:16:27,041
for the three of us
to be doing this?

251
00:16:27,125 --> 00:16:29,166
It doesn't matter.
There's no other way! 

252

[thump]

253

Mama?

254
00:16:45,416 --> 00:16:48,958
Did you hear a strange
noise upstairs just now?

255
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:51,625
No. But perhaps
your grandfather fell out

256
00:16:51,708 --> 00:16:53,375
of his wheelchair again.

257
00:16:53,458 --> 00:16:55,625
And with Valantine asleep,
there's really no one up there

258
00:16:55,708 --> 00:16:57,625
to help him get back in it, huh?

259
00:16:57,708 --> 00:17:01,333
It might turn out to be a good
rehabilitation exercise for him.

I promise I will keep
Mademoiselle Valantine safe.

Huh?

Is it me, or is he saying that
he wants us to go that way?

I don't...

I don't believe it!

It was really her?!

00:18:53,333 --> 00:18:54,583
You were gone a long time.

That's none of

Oh...! I am
so offended!

of research about me.

What is it that
you're trying to learn?

Do you wish to know
something about me?

Or something about the
Count of Monte Cristo?

all about both of them.
