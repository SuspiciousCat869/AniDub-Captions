The life of the boy

Something about a friend

you talk like that?

the matter with you?

320
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:41,166
[MICHELLE]
...ted...

321
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:43,333
The Eastern market
is just opening now.

322
00:17:43,416 --> 00:17:44,791
Pull out our shares!

323
00:17:44,875 --> 00:17:47,208
Sell off everything we've
got except our bank stocks!

324
00:17:47,291 --> 00:17:48,625
Convert it all to cash!

325
00:17:48,708 --> 00:17:51,541
[MICHELLE] Today's weather
in Paris is sunny-- sunny.

326
00:17:51,625 --> 00:17:54,125
Current temperature
is 22 Celsius-- sunny--

327
00:17:54,208 --> 00:17:56,250
with less than a 10%
chance of precipi--sunny.

328
00:17:56,333 --> 00:17:58,375
[DANGLARS] Michelle!
You've got to snap out of it!

329
00:17:58,458 --> 00:18:00,125
Michelle!

330
00:18:00,208 --> 00:18:01,333
[DANGLARS]
The Eastern market...

331
00:18:01,416 --> 00:18:03,166
[MICHELLE]
The Paris market closed today

332
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:04,791
with prices considerably lower--

333
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:06,250
[DANGLARS] Michelle,
you've got to start running

334
00:18:06,333 --> 00:18:07,666
these numbers immediately!

335
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:09,625
[MICHELLE] The prevailing
opinion is that the market

336
00:18:09,708 --> 00:18:11,250
[DANGLARS]
I can't keep up with it!

337
00:18:11,333 --> 00:18:12,958
[MICHELLE] as a result
of the sudden sell-off--

338
00:18:13,041 --> 00:18:14,666
Michelle!

339
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:16,083
[MICHELLE] Sunny, sunny,
sunny, sunny, sunny...

340
00:18:16,166 --> 00:18:17,958
Michelle!

341
00:18:18,041 --> 00:18:20,208
[MICHELLE] At the outbreak of
this market run-- sunny, sunny--

342
00:18:20,291 --> 00:18:23,125
Michelle!

343
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:30,250
What do you want, Father?

344
00:18:30,333 --> 00:18:31,458
[EUGENIE]
What's the matter?

345
00:18:31,541 --> 00:18:33,625
Why are you
barging in like this?

346
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,166
[DANGLARS] Oh Eugenie,
dear daughter of mine...

347
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:43,750
I have something
important to tell you.

348
00:18:43,833 --> 00:18:44,875
[EUGENIE]
Important?

349
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:47,750
[DANGLARS]
Yes. Something wonderful.

350
00:18:47,833 --> 00:18:49,416
The thing is,
Eugenie, your wedding

351
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,875
with Andrea Cavalcanti
has been firmly set

352
00:18:51,958 --> 00:18:53,833
for the day after tomorrow.

353
00:18:54,916 --> 00:18:57,333
But why?! I made it
clear that I'm not going

354
00:18:57,416 --> 00:18:59,625
to get married so soon
after Franz's death.

355
00:18:59,708 --> 00:19:00,750
[DANGLARS]
That's all right.

356
00:19:00,833 --> 00:19:01,666
No it's not!

357
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:03,416
Shut your mouth!

358
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:06,125
Are you saying that
you don't care if I insist?

359
00:19:06,208 --> 00:19:08,541
Grr, this entire
family dies penniless

360
00:19:08,625 --> 00:19:10,000
in a ditch thanks to you?!

361
00:19:10,083 --> 00:19:11,875
[EUGENIE]
Father, please, calm down.

362
00:19:11,958 --> 00:19:13,458
You want me to calm down?!

363
00:19:13,541 --> 00:19:14,958
How do I do that?!

364
00:19:15,041 --> 00:19:16,750
My stocks have taken a nosedive!

365
00:19:16,833 --> 00:19:19,500
They aren't worth the
paper they're printed on now!

366
00:19:19,583 --> 00:19:22,791
You should give up this
worthless piano nonsense!

367
00:19:24,833 --> 00:19:26,166
You're not serious...

368
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:29,083
You're the only one who
can save this family Eugenie.

369
00:19:29,166 --> 00:19:32,291
You've got to marry Andrea
as soon as humanly possible!

370
00:19:32,375 --> 00:19:35,416
But what about my feelings?

371
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:36,708
[DANGLARS]
They don't matter.

372
00:19:36,791 --> 00:19:38,333
The only thing
that matters to me

373
00:19:38,416 --> 00:19:40,666
is that I get all
of my money back.

374
00:19:43,875 --> 00:19:48,000
[DANGLARS] Thanks to this,
Andrea's fortune will be mine!

375
00:19:49,458 --> 00:19:51,416
[DANGLARS]
Eugenie, at this moment,

376
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:55,041
you're the most precious
thing in the world to me.

377
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:13,375
[RENAUD] Franz is still
here with us, ya know.

378
00:20:14,291 --> 00:20:16,625
Anyway, that's the way I see it.

379
00:20:17,125 --> 00:20:19,583
I get the strange feeling
that he's showing us

380
00:20:19,666 --> 00:20:21,708
what path we have to take.

381
00:20:33,083 --> 00:20:34,875
[ALBERT]
Renaud...

382
00:20:49,625 --> 00:20:51,041
[ANDREA]
And where might you be going

383
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:53,583
at this late hour, Mademoiselle?

384
00:20:58,583 --> 00:21:01,666
[EUGENIE panting]

385
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:02,666
[ANDREA grunts]

386
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:05,666
[EUGENIE gasps]

387
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:07,666
[EUGENIE]
No! Stop it!

388
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:09,625
Let go of me!

389
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:11,958
[EUGENIE]
No!

390
00:21:17,916 --> 00:21:20,750
[EUGENIE screaming]
No!

391
00:21:20,833 --> 00:21:22,416
[ANDREA] Even the
daughter of an aristocrat

392
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:24,000
would be ruined for life

393
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:26,250
if something like
this was done to her...

394
00:21:26,333 --> 00:21:27,541
Wouldn't she?!

395
00:21:27,625 --> 00:21:30,125
[ANDREA cackling]

396
00:21:30,208 --> 00:21:32,500
The day after tomorrow,
you're finally going

397
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:34,916
to belong to me and me alone.

398
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,708
I'm afraid the main course
will have to wait until then...

399
00:21:38,791 --> 00:21:42,750
[ANDREA cackling]

400
00:21:42,833 --> 00:21:45,833
[EUGENIE]
Albert, save me!

401
00:21:47,375 --> 00:21:49,333
Albert!

402
00:23:28,916 --> 00:23:30,416
[ALBERT]
Don't give up on your future.

403
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:34,333
No matter the time, no matter
the place, you're never alone.

404
00:23:34,416 --> 00:23:38,125
Next Gankutsuou, The Count
of Monte Cristo, Act 20:

405
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:39,666
"Farewell, Eugenie."

406
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:42,000
Bide your time,
and hold out hope!
