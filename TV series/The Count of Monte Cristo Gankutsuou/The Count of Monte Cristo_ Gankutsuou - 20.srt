00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:53,000
[NARRATOR] Madames and
Messieurs, good evening.

2
00:01:53,083 --> 00:01:55,750
Even when wounded
and made to suffer,

3
00:01:55,833 --> 00:02:00,166
he is reborn and makes
his way onto his feet.

4
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:03,208
Youth, what a
formidable thing it is!

5
00:02:03,291 --> 00:02:06,041
However, our resolve
to have vengeance

6
00:02:06,125 --> 00:02:08,208
will shatter even that.

7
00:02:08,291 --> 00:02:12,041
Our grip on the
reins will never loosen.

8
00:02:26,583 --> 00:02:27,708
[BUTLER]
Monsieur.

9
00:02:27,791 --> 00:02:30,750
This just arrived from
the Baron Danglars.

10
00:02:34,416 --> 00:02:36,208
I don't believe it!

11
00:02:36,291 --> 00:02:38,166
What's wrong, Renaud?

12
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:40,791
This says that the
signing ceremony

13
00:02:40,875 --> 00:02:44,458
for Eugenie's wedding is
gonna be held tomorrow.

14
00:02:45,291 --> 00:02:48,458
[RENAUD] He must really be
in rough financial shape.

15
00:02:48,541 --> 00:02:51,500
I can't believe he's rushing
the wedding like this.

16
00:03:00,541 --> 00:03:02,208
[ALBERT]
Eugenie...

17
00:03:12,958 --> 00:03:13,708
[ALBERT]
No stopping!

18
00:03:13,791 --> 00:03:16,000
[ANDREA cackling]

19
00:03:16,083 --> 00:03:17,708
[ANDREA]
Now that's just sad.

20
00:03:17,791 --> 00:03:20,291
Looks like you lost your
pride in the same instant

21
00:03:20,375 --> 00:03:22,583
that you lost your status.

22
00:03:25,833 --> 00:03:27,958
[ALBERT] You can say
whatever you want about me,

23
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:29,750
but you are gonna
let me through here.

24
00:03:29,833 --> 00:03:31,416
[ANDREA]
The princess is in a bit

25
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,125
of a foul mood at the moment.

26
00:03:33,208 --> 00:03:35,750
She even did this to me.

27
00:03:36,875 --> 00:03:37,875
What the hell?

28
00:03:37,958 --> 00:03:39,791
What did you do to Eugenie?!

29
00:03:39,875 --> 00:03:41,500
Please, isn't it obvious?

30
00:03:41,583 --> 00:03:44,416
After all, we're to be
man and wife very soon!

31
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:47,250
She put up some fierce
resistance, though.

32
00:03:47,333 --> 00:03:48,666
You bastard!

33
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:51,083
[ANDREA] Relax, I didn't do
anything as barbaric as

34
00:03:51,166 --> 00:03:52,958
to force myself on her.

35
00:03:53,041 --> 00:03:55,708
After all, I reminded
her that by marrying me,

36
00:03:55,791 --> 00:03:57,958
she would not only be
safeguarding the lifestyle

37
00:03:58,041 --> 00:03:59,833
of her own troubled family,

38
00:03:59,916 --> 00:04:03,916
but also the Morcerf,
I mean, the Mondego family.

39
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,541
The instant
I mentioned your name,

40
00:04:05,625 --> 00:04:07,875
she began to behave herself.

41
00:04:07,958 --> 00:04:11,375
I owe you a debt of gratitude.

42
00:04:11,458 --> 00:04:15,458
It seems, Albert, that
you're our sacred Cupid!

43
00:04:15,541 --> 00:04:21,708
[ANDREA cackling]

44
00:04:29,458 --> 00:04:32,666
[MONTE CRISTO] Tomorrow will go
off without a hitch, right?

45
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:35,250
What about the
Marquis, Cavalcanti?

46
00:04:35,333 --> 00:04:38,375
[BERTUCCIO] Everything is going
according to plan, Count.

47
00:04:38,458 --> 00:04:40,166
There is nothing to worry about.

48
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:42,208
Please try to get some rest.

49
00:04:43,041 --> 00:04:45,416
Fine. You may go now.

50
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,291
[BERTUCCIO]
Yes, Excellency.

51
00:04:54,125 --> 00:04:59,333
[MONTE CRISTO groaning]

52
00:04:59,416 --> 00:05:01,625
Your Excellency.

53
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:28,458
[ANDREA] Complete
humiliation and despair.

54
00:05:28,541 --> 00:05:31,791
Those will be my gifts...

55
00:05:34,708 --> 00:05:38,166
...to my dearly beloved
father and mother

56
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:42,000

[ALBERT]
Eugenie...

59
00:06:16,541 --> 00:06:18,875
Mademoiselle,
this gown is stunning,

60
00:06:18,958 --> 00:06:21,000
you look very lovely!

61
00:06:21,083 --> 00:06:22,083
How come?

62
00:06:22,166 --> 00:06:23,541
'scuse me?

63
00:06:23,625 --> 00:06:26,500
How come I'm standing here,
wearing a dress like this?

64
00:06:26,583 --> 00:06:28,000
Now, now...

65
00:06:28,083 --> 00:06:31,291
Today's is just the signing
ceremony attended by family.

66
00:06:31,375 --> 00:06:32,875
That said, I think it'd be best

67
00:06:32,958 --> 00:06:35,458
for you to wear
your formal gown.

68
00:06:36,166 --> 00:06:37,666
Ever since I was a little girl,

69
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:39,583
I never enjoyed
talking with you.

70
00:06:39,666 --> 00:06:41,708
Oh! Well, I never!

71
00:06:41,791 --> 00:06:45,000
[DANGLARS] Eugenie!
Look at you, you're beautiful!

72
00:06:45,083 --> 00:06:47,166
You really do look wonderful.

73
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:49,166
Andrea will be thrilled.

74
00:06:52,416 --> 00:06:54,083
I'd like to be left alone.

75
00:06:54,166 --> 00:06:56,458
Of course. I understand.

76
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:59,000
After all, things are
going to get hectic.

77
00:06:59,083 --> 00:07:00,750
Well, with him in the family,

78
00:07:00,833 --> 00:07:02,958
we've got nothing
to worry about.

79
00:07:03,041 --> 00:07:07,125
[DANGLARS] He's young, but that
boy has nerves of steel.

[DAMROSCH]
Mademoiselle, your performance

81
00:07:17,083 --> 00:07:19,875
at the opera house
was most impressive.

82
00:07:19,958 --> 00:07:22,083
For me, meeting fresh,
young talent

83
00:07:22,166 --> 00:07:26,166
is a joy that I would not
trade for anything in the world.

84
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:29,958
I was wondering if you
might possibly be interested

85
00:07:30,041 --> 00:07:33,166
in coming to study at
our conservatory?

[BEAUCHAMP] Monsieur Danglars
is a slick customer.

89
00:07:53,125 --> 00:07:55,666
He's trying to show everyone
his financial situation

90
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:58,333
has been stabilized by
inviting his stockholders

91
00:07:58,416 --> 00:08:00,750
and having us cover
his daughter's wedding.

92
00:08:00,833 --> 00:08:02,625
When the dust settles he'll be

93
00:08:02,708 --> 00:08:05,541
in effective control of
Marquis Cavalcanti's fortune.

94
00:08:05,625 --> 00:08:07,958
So, the question here's Albert.

95
00:08:08,041 --> 00:08:09,833
You think he'll show up?

96
00:08:09,916 --> 00:08:13,750
He will. He's no longer
part of the aristocracy.

97
00:08:13,833 --> 00:08:16,333
That means he's free.

He's like a father to me...

Try to understand.

102
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:46,125
I won't ever ask
you to forgive me.

103
00:08:46,208 --> 00:08:49,333
But at least let me try
and do something to help you!

104

Give it up.

to save the girl that you love,
