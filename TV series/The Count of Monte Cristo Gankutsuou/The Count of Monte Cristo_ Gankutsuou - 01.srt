165
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:03,875
And in the place
where those dreams lived

166
00:11:03,958 --> 00:11:07,333
stands the man that
I have become today.

for our guests.

Gentlemen, you honor me
with your presence tonight.

Not at all, sir!

00:11:20,875 --> 00:11:21,958
The honor is ours!

173
00:11:22,041 --> 00:11:23,541
In that case...

174
00:11:23,625 --> 00:11:26,708
...I want you to join me on my
balcony for luncheon tomorrow.

175
00:11:26,791 --> 00:11:27,583
It'll be wonderful.

00:11:27,666 --> 00:11:28,458
Will you come?

177
00:11:28,541 --> 00:11:29,458
Oh, really sir?

178
00:11:29,541 --> 00:11:31,375
We'd be honored to--

179
00:11:32,416 --> 00:11:33,916
We're sorry,
Your Excellency.

We appreciate your kind offer,
but we couldn't possibly accept.

Luna's public executions are the
highlight of Carnival, you know.

182
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:43,375
The festivities reach
their peak as the blood

183

of heinous criminals washes
away all the crowd's sins.

Luna's Carnival

without having seen this.

00:11:54,166 --> 00:11:57,333
Yes! You're exactly right!

[MONTE CRISTO]
Very well then.

I shall await you here

What's the
matter with you?

195
00:12:17,708 --> 00:12:19,208
You don't look so good.

196
00:12:22,166 --> 00:12:24,125
It was so cold.

His hand was
as cold as ice...

It was like

[MONTE CRISTO]
Who are today's condemned?

200
00:12:38,375 --> 00:12:39,875
[BERTUCCIO] One is a man
who committed murder

201
00:12:39,958 --> 00:12:42,000
out of his abject poverty.

202
00:12:42,083 --> 00:12:43,291
The second is a man

203
00:12:43,375 --> 00:12:45,208
who committed murder
over a love affair.

204

And finally...

205
00:12:46,791 --> 00:12:48,250
...the third is a man

206
00:12:48,333 --> 00:12:50,833
who slaughtered an entire family
to steal their possessions.

207
00:12:50,916 --> 00:12:53,041
All three of them
are heinous criminals

208
00:12:53,125 --> 00:12:55,083
who are beyond forgiveness.

You have to believe me.

00:13:17,375 --> 00:13:19,250
I didn't murder anyone!

220
00:13:19,333 --> 00:13:20,625
My rival framed me!

221

I could never murder anyone!

[CRIMINAL 2]
I didn't do it!

I suppose they're
just saying anything

that might earn them
a reprieve, right?

It seems today's program
will be most interesting.

Don't you agree?

246
00:14:14,541 --> 00:14:17,250
[MONTE CRISTO] I think we should
have a bit of sport with this.

247
00:14:18,625 --> 00:14:22,000
A little sideshow to
the execution, as it were.

248
00:14:22,083 --> 00:14:24,791
I have here in my
possession a single letter.

249
00:14:25,708 --> 00:14:26,958
It is an official
letter of pardon

250
00:14:27,041 --> 00:14:29,125
that was given to
me by the Cardinal.

251
00:14:29,208 --> 00:14:32,625
How in the world did you
get something like that?

252
00:14:34,083 --> 00:14:36,083
Unfortunately,
I have but this one letter

253
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:38,250
of pardon with which to play.

254
00:14:38,333 --> 00:14:40,333
Now to make the
choice of which man

255
00:14:40,416 --> 00:14:42,750
should get this letter
an impartial one...

256
00:14:42,833 --> 00:14:46,416
I have written the initials of
a condemned man on each card.

257
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:50,333
Now, you need only to choose
one from among the three.

258
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:53,958
Come now, gentlemen...

259
00:14:54,041 --> 00:14:56,708
it's nothing more
than a little game.

260
00:14:56,791 --> 00:14:57,958
Just a minute, Your Excellency!

261
00:14:58,041 --> 00:14:59,291
If that's the case, then...

262
00:14:59,375 --> 00:15:01,750
...shouldn't we hear what
they have to say first?!

263
00:15:01,833 --> 00:15:03,750
My good Monsieur Franz,

264
00:15:03,833 --> 00:15:06,666
this is nothing more than
a game, we are not judges.

265
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:10,375
Regardless of what we do,
they are all going to die.

266
00:15:10,458 --> 00:15:11,916
I merely suggest
that we make use

267
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,958
of that fact in order
to enjoy ourselves.

268
00:15:15,583 --> 00:15:17,625
At this moment, we have
in our hands the power

269
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:21,500
to offer the hand of salvation
to one of these poor souls.

I wonder Monsier...

Why do you hesitate to
use that power to do good?

272
00:15:27,958 --> 00:15:29,291
Yes, it almost feels as

273
00:15:29,375 --> 00:15:33,500
if one has actually
become God, does it not?

What's the matter with you?!

Yes, it is a game.

But, of course, to me our
own lives are merely pieces

that are manipulated as part
of someone else's game.

way to you, Monsieur Franz?

The time has come...

My vengeance Has finally
been set into motion.

[FRANZ] Hey, let's go to
a cafe and clear our heads.

Or how about the

Oh, right. Sorry about that.

I forgot you don't
do that sort of thing.

Well, we could
go to the casino...

you were the one who
was just dying to see it.

And then you let the Count talk
you into picking that card--
