Fine, let her have it her way.

All right, you good-for-
nothin's! Time to go back!

[ALBERT] All I could do was
stand there and stare.

00:03:13,791 --> 00:03:18,458
At the now masterless
number 30, Champs Elysees.

10
00:03:18,541 --> 00:03:20,291
At the city blocks
that had crumbled away

11
00:03:20,375 --> 00:03:23,208
like sandcastles
built on the beach.

12
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:29,416
At the silent blue sky
that spread out above me.

13
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:34,250
So... The summer
storm had come and gone.

14
00:03:34,333 --> 00:03:38,375
Along with the
end of our summer.

15
00:04:31,166 --> 00:04:33,833
[BEAUCHAMP] Well, if it
isn't the Chief Secretary.

16
00:04:33,916 --> 00:04:35,333
[DEBRAY]
Hm?

17
00:04:35,416 --> 00:04:37,541
[DEBRAY] Ah, the Assistant
Editor-in-Chief came in person?

18
00:04:37,625 --> 00:04:39,416
You know, you're a hard worker!

19
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,291
[BEAUCHAMP] I was just
worried about whether or not

20
00:04:41,375 --> 00:04:42,541
you're doing your job.

21
00:04:42,625 --> 00:04:45,791
Tell me, how's the
peace treaty coming along?

22
00:04:45,875 --> 00:04:49,125
"Treaty nears finalization
at long last."

23
00:04:49,208 --> 00:04:52,166
So, pretty good.

24
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:53,458
[DEBRAY]
Thanks to this treaty,

25
00:04:53,541 --> 00:04:55,708
the full restoration
of diplomatic relations

26
00:04:55,791 --> 00:04:58,750
between us and the Empire
is starting to look possible.

27
00:04:58,833 --> 00:05:00,375
[BEAUCHAMP]
So, this obscene marathon

28
00:05:00,458 --> 00:05:03,166
of a war is finally
gonna come to an end...

29
00:05:04,416 --> 00:05:07,166
Civilian interaction will
become commonplace again,

30
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:09,583
and citizens of both
nations will embrace.

31
00:05:09,666 --> 00:05:12,083
And then we'll see the birth
of a nation that's prosperous

32
00:05:12,166 --> 00:05:14,750
in the truest sense of the word.

33
00:05:14,833 --> 00:05:18,541
Not a nation where only a select
few can live free and prosper.

34
00:05:18,625 --> 00:05:19,916
Right?

35
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:25,166
You know there's no telling when
the times will change again.

36
00:05:26,708 --> 00:05:29,375
Yeah, well even so, I really
want to believe in them.

37
00:05:29,458 --> 00:05:31,291
I want to believe
in all of the people

38
00:05:31,375 --> 00:05:33,708
who chose this
solution at this time.

39
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:36,958
And that includes
you, my old friend.

40
00:05:37,041 --> 00:05:40,083
Me, I just go with the
flow during all times.

41
00:05:40,166 --> 00:05:41,791
Well, let's leave the
question of the truth

42
00:05:41,875 --> 00:05:44,083
of that statement
for another day.

43
00:05:44,166 --> 00:05:48,375
Today we've got our long-awaited
reunion with old friends.

44
00:05:48,958 --> 00:05:49,750
What's the matter?

45
00:05:49,833 --> 00:05:51,791
Agh!

46
00:05:51,875 --> 00:05:54,875
Oh, don't tell me, you forgot
to make the reservations?

47
00:05:54,958 --> 00:05:55,541
Sorry!

48
00:05:55,625 --> 00:05:56,833
Tell my secretary

49
00:05:56,916 --> 00:05:59,208
I'll be late for the
afternoon Cabinet meeting!

50
00:05:59,291 --> 00:06:01,083
I'll tell her that you're
out making a reservation

don't trust her with.

Thank goodness you're okay!

and do what
Emmanuel told you to do?

65

Of course we did!

You bet, Uncle!

That's good.

[MAXIMILIEN]
Well, sir, I've returned.

80
00:07:54,625 --> 00:07:57,458
The elusive peace that
you dreamed about for so

81
00:07:57,541 --> 00:07:59,750
long between the
Earth and the Empire

82
00:07:59,833 --> 00:08:01,833
is finally about
to come to pass.

83
00:08:01,916 --> 00:08:04,750
For that reason, I have
resigned from the military

84
00:08:04,833 --> 00:08:07,875
and am now a humble civilian.

85
00:08:08,875 --> 00:08:11,250
In a fairly short time
the flow of goods traveling

86
00:08:11,333 --> 00:08:14,166
between Earth and the
Empire will begin to grow.

87
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:17,708
So I intend to buy
back the Pharaon,

88
00:08:17,791 --> 00:08:21,583
and help Emmanuel and Julie
with the family business, see?

00:08:21,666 --> 00:08:23,958
Oh, Maximilien...

Come on, Valentine!

If we don't get moving soon,
we'll be late for the party!

an eye for quality, sir!

That's a very rare import.

[STALL OWNER] These models

It says Monsieur Albert

on the day of the
coronation ceremony.

And that he will do
so as a secretarial aide

to the Earth's ambassador.

you call this, if not fate?

121
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:44,208
[BERTUCCIO]
I think that our old master

122
00:10:44,291 --> 00:10:46,833
must have guided
him here to you, Princess.

123

I also wish to keep Janina safe
from all who might threaten her,

00:11:05,541 --> 00:11:09,791
so that this peace endures
for many years to come.

I'm certain that, that

to find a buyer for you.

160
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:49,541
As such, we will be taking
the house as payment in kind

161
00:13:49,625 --> 00:13:52,583
for the five years of
accumulated back taxes.

162
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:53,666
Uh...

and management of
said land and structures."

166
00:13:59,916 --> 00:14:02,041
You're sure that's
all right with you?

167
00:14:02,125 --> 00:14:04,833
Yes, sir. I have
no objections to that.

168

[OFFICIAL] In that case, please
read and sign this form.

Excuse me...

170
00:14:13,083 --> 00:14:15,916
Would it be all right if
I went into the mansion

171
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,083
and looked around
the place one last time?

172
00:14:18,166 --> 00:14:19,041
Of course.

173
00:14:19,125 --> 00:14:21,708
Feel free to go in, Monsieur.

174
00:14:21,791 --> 00:14:23,625
Please...

[ALBERT]
Franz...

177
00:17:01,041 --> 00:17:02,500
[ALBERT]
I guess I've been pretty frantic

178
00:17:02,583 --> 00:17:05,708
these past five years.

179
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:07,291
I just read books like crazy,

180
00:17:07,375 --> 00:17:10,125
always hunched over my
desk for hours at a time.

181
00:17:10,208 --> 00:17:14,041
And before I knew it,
I was already turning 20.

182
00:17:14,125 --> 00:17:19,083
I was... I was
completely frantic.

183
00:17:19,166 --> 00:17:21,625
I told myself
that I had to live.

184
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:25,708
That I had to live in your
place, in Father's place,

185
00:17:25,791 --> 00:17:27,833
and in the Count's place.

186
00:17:29,458 --> 00:17:31,291
Oh, Franz...

187
00:17:31,375 --> 00:17:34,541
I was terrified all the time...

188
00:17:34,625 --> 00:17:37,666
...of finding myself
trapped by the past.

189
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:40,083
I was afraid that I might
become totally obsessed

190
00:17:40,166 --> 00:17:43,583
with the past and end up
hating someone around me.

191
00:17:46,583 --> 00:17:50,375
I'm sorry, Franz...

192
00:17:50,458 --> 00:17:52,416
I'm sorry...

193
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:56,791
I'm sorry I haven't come
back for such a long time.

[EDMOND]
Mademoiselle Mercedes Herrera.

195
00:18:06,583 --> 00:18:10,625
It has been a long time.
How are you?

196
00:18:10,708 --> 00:18:14,041
The ship has finally begun
her return voyage to Earth.

197
00:18:14,125 --> 00:18:18,375
Unfortunately, the
Captain has fallen quite ill.

198
00:18:18,458 --> 00:18:20,375
I don't think that
it's anything serious,

199
00:18:20,458 --> 00:18:24,000
but it looks as if our
return will be delayed.

200
00:18:24,083 --> 00:18:27,166
To be perfectly honest, I wish
I could come home right now

201
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:29,583
and hold you in my arms.

202
00:18:29,666 --> 00:18:32,916
That day we set sail, I watched
the lights of Marseilles

203
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,625
from the porthole
as they faded away.

204
00:18:35,708 --> 00:18:40,458
A day doesn't go by when I don't
think back on that warm light,

205
00:18:40,541 --> 00:18:42,583
the light of my loved ones.

206
00:18:42,666 --> 00:18:43,875
Guided by that light,

207
00:18:43,958 --> 00:18:47,833
I never lose my way
or stray from my path.

208
00:18:49,125 --> 00:18:50,833
That light that is shining

209
00:18:50,916 --> 00:18:55,375
so brightly in our
future is happiness.

210
00:18:55,458 --> 00:18:59,208
So please wait for
me and don't worry.

211
00:18:59,291 --> 00:19:01,458
Instead of holding
you in my arms now,

212
00:19:01,541 --> 00:19:04,333
I offer you these words.

213
00:19:04,416 --> 00:19:08,250
"Bide your time,
and hold out hope."

214
00:19:10,333 --> 00:19:13,250
To my beloved Mercedes...

215
00:19:13,333 --> 00:19:15,916
...with all my heart.

216
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:21,125
Eternally yours, Edmond Dantes.

217
00:19:24,666 --> 00:19:27,458
So, you've always been here.

218
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:31,000
For all of this time
since before I was born,

219
00:19:31,083 --> 00:19:33,041
you've been right here.

220
00:19:42,416 --> 00:19:44,583
[ALBERT]
I'll never forget...

221
00:19:46,458 --> 00:19:50,625
...the time I spent with
you, and with my father.

222
00:19:50,708 --> 00:19:53,333
Or the time I spent
with the Count.

223
00:19:53,416 --> 00:19:57,625
I swear Franz.
I promise this to you.

224
00:19:57,708 --> 00:20:01,125
No matter where the
rest of my life takes me...

225
00:20:01,208 --> 00:20:05,708
I swear I'll never
forget... that summer.

226
00:20:05,791 --> 00:20:07,333
Never.
