Hear me, noble souls
acting in unison.

Why the sudden return?

I've come here to
fetch Monsieur Noirtier.

He needs to be cared for

best by Valentine's side.

You're right.

another quarrel with
Monsieur Villefort,

74
00:05:18,333 --> 00:05:19,541
but I heard the news

of his arrest the instant
I arrived in Paris.

76
00:05:22,458 --> 00:05:25,833
It came as quite a shock to
hear what had become of him.

I see you're still as
upright and formal as ever.

were there, Albert,

that I was able to save
those who are dearest to me.

are old friends and that you've

I figured it'd be a good idea if
I used my personal connections,

146
00:08:54,916 --> 00:08:56,958
so I was hoping to
ask you a few questions.

why do you think your father

has managed to achieve such
amazing success here in Paris?

152
00:09:10,041 --> 00:09:13,041
I'd like to hear your frank
opinion as one of the people

closest to the
center of his world.

154

Well, let me think about it.

155
00:09:18,875 --> 00:09:20,875
I guess his sincerity.

156
00:09:20,958 --> 00:09:22,500
You see my father
loves and worries

157
00:09:22,583 --> 00:09:25,458
about this country in the same
way that he loves my mother

and his family.

159
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:29,916
Have you heard about
how my father became a hero

to the bitter end?

00:09:32,083 --> 00:09:33,625
After he returned to Paris,

162
00:09:33,708 --> 00:09:35,833
he used that accomplishment
as a springboard

163
00:09:35,916 --> 00:09:37,333
and shot up through
the military,

164
00:09:37,416 --> 00:09:40,166
making it to the rank of general
in spite of his young age.

165
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:41,875
[BEAUCHAMP]
And now he's making a bid

166
00:09:41,958 --> 00:09:43,916
for the presidency itself, huh?

167
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,458
[ALBERT] Yes. My father's
enthusiasm for politics

168
00:09:46,541 --> 00:09:47,583
is the very deal.

169
00:09:47,666 --> 00:09:49,000
[BEAUCHAMP]
I see...

170
00:09:49,083 --> 00:09:51,666
For what it's worth I'm
rooting for your father, too.

171
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:54,458
Tell him he should watch
out for enemies.

172
00:09:54,541 --> 00:09:56,750
You should watch your back, too.

173
00:09:56,833 --> 00:09:58,083
[ALBERT]
Did something happen?

174
00:09:58,166 --> 00:10:00,625
[BEAUCHAMP] Nah, I'm sure
it's nothing serious.

175
00:10:00,708 --> 00:10:03,583
But when you deal in gossip
like you do in my line of work,

176
00:10:03,666 --> 00:10:06,208
you get all kinds of
crazy tips thrown at you.

177
00:10:06,291 --> 00:10:09,541
Tales of bribery, kickbacks,
betrayals, illicit affairs --

178
00:10:09,625 --> 00:10:11,541
You get pretty sick of it.

179
00:10:12,291 --> 00:10:13,833
Now that's really hilarious!

180
00:10:13,916 --> 00:10:16,416
My father would never be
involved with any of that stuff.

181
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,500
Frankly, I'm more worried
that he might be

182
00:10:18,583 --> 00:10:21,250
a little too straight-laced
to be a successful politician.

183
00:10:21,333 --> 00:10:23,708
You're kidding, really?

184
00:10:23,791 --> 00:10:26,916
I might even be relieved if he
ever did something like that.

185
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,708
He's a lot shrewder than
I ever gave him credit for.

186
00:10:29,791 --> 00:10:30,916
[BEAUCHAMP]
I guess you're right.

187
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,166
I'm really sorry to
worry you over nothing.

188
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:36,541
The fact of the matter is
a weird guy paid me a visit.

189
00:10:36,625 --> 00:10:39,666
He was this very creepy,
sleazy old man.

190
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:42,125
What did he say his name was?

191
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:44,791
Caderousse, or
something like that.

192
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,250
[ALBERT]
What did he--

193
00:10:47,333 --> 00:10:50,041
What did that man say
to you about my father?

194
00:10:50,125 --> 00:10:52,541
Oh, just some stupid story.

195
00:10:52,625 --> 00:10:54,916
Something about how the reports
of your father's exploits

196
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,416
at Janina are all
a bunch of lies.

197
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:01,625
I told him he was full of
crap and chased him away.

198
00:11:01,708 --> 00:11:03,583
[ALBERT]
I see...

199
00:11:04,791 --> 00:11:06,541
[COMPUTER A] Open flames
are strictly prohibited

200
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:07,791
in this building.

201
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:11,041
Please extinguish your
lighter immediately.

202
00:11:11,125 --> 00:11:13,125
Smoking is prohibited
in this room.

203
00:11:13,208 --> 00:11:15,916
Please smoke only
in designated areas.

204
00:11:24,166 --> 00:11:26,666
[BEAUCHAMP] I guess I'd
better look into this.

205
00:11:35,333 --> 00:11:36,958
[BARKER muffled]
Step right up, step right up!

206
00:11:37,041 --> 00:11:39,291
Pay our establishment
a visit tonight.

207
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:45,916
[CADEROUSSE] The dead man has
once again come back to us!

208
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:51,083
He would never forget what
we did, not in a million years.

209
00:11:51,166 --> 00:11:52,625
[BEAUCHAMP]
Your father's exploits at Janina

210
00:11:52,708 --> 00:11:54,166
are all a bunch of lies.

211
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:56,625
[VILLEFORT] Disaster will come
calling at your house, too!

212
00:11:56,708 --> 00:11:57,833
You'll see.

213
00:11:57,916 --> 00:12:01,000
[ALBERT] It's not possible.
It couldn't be.

214
00:12:01,083 --> 00:12:03,208
[NEWSCASTER A] First of all,
Marquis Cavalcanti,

215
00:12:03,291 --> 00:12:04,958
you've announced
that you are making

216
00:12:05,041 --> 00:12:06,875
a huge investment
in the Danglars Bank.

217
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:09,083
What was it that prompted
that decision, sir?

218
00:12:09,166 --> 00:12:11,750
[ANDREA] Well, I leave
all my investment matters

219
00:12:11,833 --> 00:12:13,958
to my advisory analysts.

220
00:12:14,041 --> 00:12:15,458
[ANDREA]
I abide by their decisions

221
00:12:15,541 --> 00:12:17,875
and follow their advice.
And that's that.

222
00:12:17,958 --> 00:12:20,000
There are also rumors
circulating around

223
00:12:20,083 --> 00:12:22,666
that you've been seeing
Baron Danglars' daughter.

224
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:24,791
Oh, are there really?

225
00:12:24,875 --> 00:12:26,291
[NEWSCASTER A]
I realize that it's personal,

226
00:12:26,375 --> 00:12:29,041
but if you would care
to make a comment...

227
00:12:29,125 --> 00:12:31,541
[ANDREA] All right,
just a brief one, then.

228
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:34,416
The fact of the matter is
that Eugenie de Danglars and I

229
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:37,458
were formally
engaged this morning.

230
00:12:37,541 --> 00:12:39,458
[NEWSCASTER A] Goodness!
It's like a fairy tale!

231
00:12:39,541 --> 00:12:42,625
Is that true? Congratulations
on your engagement!

232
00:12:42,708 --> 00:12:45,166
This is big news, everyone!

233
00:12:46,541 --> 00:12:48,125
It's all a lie...

234
00:12:48,208 --> 00:12:50,166
[EUGENIE] Idiot.
If I'd known you were here,

235
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:52,541
I would've been able
to play even better.

236
00:12:52,625 --> 00:12:54,333
I'd have played for you.

237
00:12:54,416 --> 00:12:57,750
[ANDREA] Yes. Naturally, she's
overjoyed about this, too.

238
00:12:57,833 --> 00:12:59,250
[BARKER]
Step right up fo--

239
00:12:59,333 --> 00:13:00,750
[GENTLEMAN A]
Hey! Watch it!

240
00:13:04,791 --> 00:13:06,708
[ALBERT]
Eugenie...

241
00:13:07,625 --> 00:13:08,708
[ALBERT]
Please! Please!

242
00:13:08,791 --> 00:13:10,333
I have to speak with Eugenie.

243
00:13:10,416 --> 00:13:12,041
Let me see her.

244
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:13,916
[BUTLER A] Mademoiselle has
said that she doesn't wish

245
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,250
to speak with you anymore.

246
00:13:15,333 --> 00:13:16,750
I want to see her in person

247
00:13:16,833 --> 00:13:18,541
and ask her how
she feels about this.

248
00:13:18,625 --> 00:13:19,625
Please, I'm begging!

249
00:13:19,708 --> 00:13:21,916
[BUTLER A]
I am very sorry, Monsieur.

250
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:25,250
[ALBERT]
Please!

251
00:13:25,333 --> 00:13:29,208
Come on! At least
tell her that I'm here!

252
00:13:29,291 --> 00:13:31,750
Hey! Eugenie!

253
00:13:41,083 --> 00:13:43,208
[EUGENIE] Was someone
at the door just now?

254
00:13:43,291 --> 00:13:44,791
[BUTLER A]
No, Mademoiselle.

255
00:13:44,875 --> 00:13:46,541
Just a deliveryman.

256
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:48,791
[EUGENIE]
Oh.

257
00:13:51,833 --> 00:13:54,166
[EUGENIE]
What are all these flowers for?

258
00:13:55,208 --> 00:13:56,916
[EUGENIE]
What's the meaning of this?!

259
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,416
How could you
arrange my engagement

260
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,541
without even
asking me about it?!

261
00:14:00,625 --> 00:14:03,500
[DANGLARS] I told you that your
happiness is always my first

262
00:14:03,583 --> 00:14:05,166
and foremost concern, didn't I?

263
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:07,666
[EUGENIE] But I'm the one who's
going to have to marry him!

264
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:09,833
[DANGLARS] You're still
very young, Eugenie.

265
00:14:09,916 --> 00:14:13,666
Far too young to make
important decisions on your own.

266
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:16,875
Do you really mean what
you're saying to me, Father?

267
00:14:16,958 --> 00:14:18,708
Yes. Of course.

268
00:14:20,041 --> 00:14:21,958
I wish you'd stop doing this!

269
00:14:22,041 --> 00:14:24,291
[DANGLARS]
Where do you think you're going?

270
00:14:24,375 --> 00:14:27,666
I invited Marquis Cavalcanti
to dinner tonight.

271
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:30,125
Don't be late!

272
00:14:33,708 --> 00:14:36,000
[PEPPO] If you're looking for
Albert, he's out right now.

273
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:36,958
[EUGENIE]
Out where?

274
00:14:37,041 --> 00:14:38,500
[PEPPO]
I don't know.

275
00:14:38,583 --> 00:14:40,000
[EUGENIE]
Oh.

276
00:14:48,916 --> 00:14:51,166
Where are you Albert?

277
00:15:40,083 --> 00:15:41,208
That hurt!

278
00:15:41,291 --> 00:15:42,916
I didn't throw mine
that hard at you, did I?

279
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,958
[ALBERT]
You bastard! Jerk!

280
00:15:45,958 --> 00:15:47,791
[ALBERT]
Now you're gonna get it!

281
00:15:51,625 --> 00:15:55,166
[ALBERT] It's all over
between me and Eugenie.

282
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:58,250
[FRANZ] I heard that she got
engaged to Cavalcanti.

283
00:15:58,333 --> 00:16:00,250
[ALBERT]
Yeah.

284
00:16:00,333 --> 00:16:02,166
[FRANZ] I know this isn't
what Eugenie wants.

285
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:05,208
There has to be
something behind it.

286
00:16:05,291 --> 00:16:07,041
You know she'd never
volunteer to get engaged

287
00:16:07,125 --> 00:16:08,958
to a guy like that.

288
00:16:09,041 --> 00:16:11,375
I'm not so sure...

289
00:16:11,958 --> 00:16:14,125
[ALBERT]
I not so sure about anything.

290
00:16:14,208 --> 00:16:17,666
I can't tell what the real
truth is or what's a lie.

291
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:19,041
I just don't--

292
00:16:19,125 --> 00:16:21,250
I just don't seem
to know anymore.

293
00:16:21,333 --> 00:16:22,250
Listen Albert...

294
00:16:22,333 --> 00:16:24,041
Franz I'm...

295
00:16:24,125 --> 00:16:26,208
I'm still me, aren't I?

296
00:16:26,291 --> 00:16:28,708
I mean whatever happens I'll...

297
00:16:28,791 --> 00:16:31,166
...I'll still be-- 

298
00:16:32,125 --> 00:16:33,875
Please, Franz, tell me!
I won't change!

299
00:16:33,958 --> 00:16:35,833
You gotta promise me
that I won't change!

300
00:16:35,916 --> 00:16:39,416
No matter what happens,
I'm gonna be me, right?!

301
00:16:47,166 --> 00:16:51,500
[FRANZ] "Death is certain,
its hour uncertain," Well.

302
00:16:51,583 --> 00:16:53,916
Talk about a sinister.

303
00:16:55,291 --> 00:16:57,375
[FRANZ]
Albert.

304
00:16:57,458 --> 00:17:00,583
As far as I'm concerned, I think
I'd want to know the truth.

305
00:17:00,666 --> 00:17:02,541
Even if discovering the truth

306
00:17:02,625 --> 00:17:05,125
would completely
change who I am.

307
00:17:05,208 --> 00:17:06,708
You're right, Franz...

308
00:17:06,791 --> 00:17:09,875
I've been thinking that I might
leave Paris for a little while.

309
00:17:09,958 --> 00:17:12,958
Oh, yeah? You gonna
go back to Luna?

310
00:17:13,041 --> 00:17:14,333
Good idea!

311
00:17:14,416 --> 00:17:16,708
At a time like this,
a trip is the best thing to--

312
00:17:16,791 --> 00:17:19,625
Sorry, but I can't
take you with me.

313
00:17:20,083 --> 00:17:21,333
And why the hell not?!

314
00:17:21,416 --> 00:17:23,833
What's the big deal anyway?!

315
00:17:23,916 --> 00:17:25,916
Look, I'm sorry.

316
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:30,125
Oh, great, you too, huh?

317
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:32,208
[ALBERT]
Yeah, now I get it.

318
00:17:32,291 --> 00:17:33,541
We've all grown up.

319
00:17:33,625 --> 00:17:36,916
We're supposed to keep
secrets from each other.

320
00:17:38,208 --> 00:17:39,458
You know what Franz?

321
00:17:39,541 --> 00:17:41,833
I think that you and
I should call it quits, too.

322
00:17:41,916 --> 00:17:45,125
I mean, really,
a secret hideout?

323
00:17:45,208 --> 00:17:48,625
Heh, what are we
still a couple of kids?

324
00:17:48,708 --> 00:17:50,708
No Albert...

325
00:18:02,833 --> 00:18:04,083
[FRANZ]
Wait for me, Albert.

326
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:07,000
Trust me, I'll
get you to the truth.

327
00:18:07,083 --> 00:18:08,458
I promise you!

328
00:18:17,791 --> 00:18:19,791
[MONTE CRISTO]
Albert!

329
00:18:21,041 --> 00:18:22,583
[ALBERT]
Count?

330
00:18:22,666 --> 00:18:24,625
Oh good! You weren't
hurt! I was worried.

331
00:18:24,708 --> 00:18:27,541
[MONTE CRISTO]
No, I am right as rain.

332
00:18:27,625 --> 00:18:30,000
Is something the
matter with you, Albert?

333
00:18:30,083 --> 00:18:32,083
You're out without an umbrella.

334
00:18:32,166 --> 00:18:33,791
Oh, I thought
that getting soaked

335
00:18:33,875 --> 00:18:35,916
for a change wouldn't
be such a bad thing.

336
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,416
[MONTE CRISTO]
So I see.

337
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:41,208
Albert I'm on my way to take
another journey into space.

338
00:18:41,291 --> 00:18:42,416
What do you say?

339
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:45,416
Would you care to
join me on my adventure?

340
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:48,375
Thanks, but... It's not
a good time right now.

341
00:18:48,458 --> 00:18:49,791
[MONTE CRISTO]
Oh, I see.

342
00:18:49,875 --> 00:18:51,416
[ALBERT]
I'm sorry.

343
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:53,875
[MONTE CRISTO]
There is no need to apologize.

344
00:18:53,958 --> 00:18:56,375
Perhaps another time then.

345
00:18:56,458 --> 00:18:59,041
I hope that it will be soon.

346
00:19:12,583 --> 00:19:14,583
[MONTE CRISTO] I cannot bring
myself to leave you here,

347
00:19:14,666 --> 00:19:17,166
not with that look on your face.

348
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:20,916
Come on, let's get
away from this city.

349
00:19:25,833 --> 00:19:27,875
Eugenie welcome home.

350
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:31,583
We tried to wait for you,
but dinner has ended now.

351
00:19:31,666 --> 00:19:34,208
I was just out
looking for Albert.

352
00:19:34,291 --> 00:19:36,916
I can clearly see
that still there is room

353
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,166
in your heart
for no one but him.

354
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:42,791
Monsieur Albert has
gone off into deep space.

355
00:19:42,875 --> 00:19:45,166
Apparently, he is
going to spend time

356
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:47,833
with the Count at
his summer retreat.

357
00:19:47,916 --> 00:19:51,083
[EUGENIE]
Oh... so that's where he is.

358
00:19:51,166 --> 00:19:52,625
I nearly forgot.

359
00:19:52,708 --> 00:19:55,875
There's been a steady stream
of flowers to congratulate you.

360
00:19:59,125 --> 00:20:02,000
This flower is from me.

361
00:20:11,625 --> 00:20:16,250
[EUGENIE sobbing]

362
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:19,041
[ALBERT]
Why?

363
00:20:19,125 --> 00:20:21,791
Why do these things
keep happening to me?

364
00:20:24,291 --> 00:20:27,250
Why do you suppose
my luck is so bad?

365
00:20:28,083 --> 00:20:31,083
[ALBERT]
Oh, Count. I'm afraid...

366
00:20:31,916 --> 00:20:35,458
What's the truth? What is a lie?

367
00:20:35,541 --> 00:20:37,333
[MONTE CRISTO] That is something
that you must decide

368
00:20:37,416 --> 00:20:38,875
[MONTE CRISTO] for yourself.
[ALBERT] Huh?

369
00:20:38,958 --> 00:20:41,541
Do you have the inner resolve
to overcome your limitations

370
00:20:41,625 --> 00:20:44,166
and press ever onward?

371
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:47,291
If you possess a powerful
will that bends to no one,

372
00:20:47,375 --> 00:20:50,666
I can say this with
absolute certainty:

373
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:53,416
You will be just fine Albert.

374
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:55,916
I sure hope you're right.

375
00:21:05,875 --> 00:21:07,083
[REPORTER A]
The first public speech

376
00:21:07,166 --> 00:21:08,333
by presidential front runner

377
00:21:08,416 --> 00:21:10,708
General Fernand de Morcerf
is about to begin

378
00:21:10,791 --> 00:21:12,500
in the National
Assembly building

379
00:21:12,583 --> 00:21:13,791
here in the heart of Paris.

380
00:21:13,875 --> 00:21:15,791
Numerous public figures
have rushed here to show

381
00:21:15,875 --> 00:21:17,833
their support, and the
crowd inside the hall

382
00:21:17,916 --> 00:21:19,750
is already at a fever pitch!

383
00:21:19,833 --> 00:21:22,125
General Morcerf,
are you ready? It's time.

384
00:21:22,208 --> 00:21:24,541
Please take your place
on the stage, sir.

385
00:21:25,375 --> 00:21:29,375
You know I only made it this far
because I had you at my side.

386
00:21:29,458 --> 00:21:33,250
Oh, Fernand I am
so proud of you.

387
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:43,958
[CROWD cheering]

388
00:21:44,041 --> 00:21:51,291
[CROWD cheering]

389
00:21:54,833 --> 00:21:55,791
[HAIDEE]
Get the car ready!

390
00:21:55,875 --> 00:21:58,416
I'm going to the
National Assembly!

391
00:23:28,541 --> 00:23:31,333
[ALBERT] Away from the worlds of
men, I am alone with the Count.

392
00:23:31,416 --> 00:23:34,125
But there is no
escaping from the truth.

393
00:23:34,208 --> 00:23:37,791
Next Gankutsuou, The Count
of Monte Cristo, Act 15:

394
00:23:37,875 --> 00:23:40,416
"The End of Happiness,
The Beginning of Truth".

395
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:42,500
Bide your time,
and hold out hope!
