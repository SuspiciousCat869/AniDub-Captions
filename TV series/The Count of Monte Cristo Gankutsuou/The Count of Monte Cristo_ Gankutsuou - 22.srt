00:01:49,625 --> 00:01:53,625
[NARRATOR] Madames and
Messieurs, good evening.

2
00:01:53,708 --> 00:01:56,541
"Death is nothing
but a release,"

3
00:01:56,625 --> 00:02:00,333
my friend once muttered
to me in a moment of candor.

4
00:02:00,416 --> 00:02:02,625
"If death is a release,

5
00:02:02,708 --> 00:02:05,666
what is it that you wish
to give to them for it?"

6
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:08,416
My friend answered
me succinctly.

7
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:13,083
"I will give them eternal
suffering and remorse."

8
00:02:15,041 --> 00:02:16,000
All right Count.

9
00:02:16,083 --> 00:02:17,833
I'm done with running away.

10
00:02:20,166 --> 00:02:23,458
I want the truth. Now.

11
00:02:33,458 --> 00:02:34,541
[STAFF OFFICER]
General...

12
00:02:34,625 --> 00:02:36,458
I beg your pardon
but are you sure

13
00:02:36,541 --> 00:02:38,291
that we're doing
the right thing?

14
00:02:38,375 --> 00:02:39,083
Don't worry.

15
00:02:39,166 --> 00:02:41,083
I know that you're afraid.

16
00:02:41,833 --> 00:02:43,750
You see, there's
never actually been

17
00:02:43,833 --> 00:02:45,541
such a thing as "the truth"!

18
00:02:45,625 --> 00:02:48,375
The truth is something
that you yourself create

19
00:02:48,458 --> 00:02:51,416
based on your own
personal convictions.

20
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,541
Even if it means setting
aside our conscience

21
00:02:53,625 --> 00:02:57,083
and turning our
weapons against our own?

22
00:02:57,166 --> 00:03:00,666
People never really
look at their conscience.

23
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:02,750
[FERNAND]
What they see is the truth

24
00:03:02,833 --> 00:03:05,041
that is standing
there before them!

[ALBERT]
It was the day before he--

26
00:03:07,625 --> 00:03:09,791
The day before Franz died.

27
00:03:09,875 --> 00:03:12,625
That day, I walked
all the way here

28
00:03:12,708 --> 00:03:15,041
after you confessed
your plans to me.

29
00:03:15,125 --> 00:03:17,916
My world turned
totally upside down.

30
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,833
I clearly remember
how my tears flowed.

31
00:03:20,916 --> 00:03:22,041
They wouldn't stop.

32
00:03:22,125 --> 00:03:23,958
No matter how much I tried,

33
00:03:24,041 --> 00:03:26,291
they just wouldn't stop.

[ALBERT]
Franz...

35
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:31,458
Franz left some
parting words to me.

36
00:03:31,541 --> 00:03:34,083
He said never to hate anyone.

37
00:03:34,166 --> 00:03:36,625
He said that feelings of
love and feelings of hate

38
00:03:36,708 --> 00:03:40,208
both start out as a
deep caring for someone.

39

[MONTE CRISTO]
25 years ago,

67
00:05:34,541 --> 00:05:37,541
I was a young man
named Edmond Dantes.

68
00:05:37,625 --> 00:05:39,958
And I was very naive.

69
00:05:40,041 --> 00:05:41,541
Indeed, before that day,

70
00:05:41,625 --> 00:05:43,958
I knew nothing of
mistrusting others.

71
00:05:44,041 --> 00:05:46,041
I passed the days,
working and praying

72
00:05:46,125 --> 00:05:49,000
for the happiness of
my father and fiancée.

73
00:05:49,625 --> 00:05:50,833
Edmond Dantes!

74
00:05:50,916 --> 00:05:52,750
You are under arrest
as a prime suspect

75
00:05:52,833 --> 00:05:55,500
in the assassination
of the Prince!

76
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:57,375
Oh Edmond!

77
00:05:57,458 --> 00:05:58,791
Edmond!

78
00:05:58,875 --> 00:06:00,875
[EDMOND] Mercedes! This is
all some kind of mistake!

79
00:06:00,958 --> 00:06:01,958
Don't worry about me!

80
00:06:02,041 --> 00:06:04,500
Let go of him! Edmond!

81
00:06:04,583 --> 00:06:06,041
Edmond!

82
00:06:08,708 --> 00:06:11,125
[VILLEFORT] You've been
charged with a crime.

83
00:06:11,208 --> 00:06:12,875
But I haven't done anything!

84
00:06:12,958 --> 00:06:15,041
It was an anonymous tip.

85
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:16,791
According to the accusation,

86
00:06:16,875 --> 00:06:19,250
you have in your possession
a letter that contains the facts

87
00:06:19,333 --> 00:06:21,958
behind the plot to
assassinate the Prince.

88
00:06:22,041 --> 00:06:24,041
What in the world
are you talking about?

89
00:06:24,125 --> 00:06:26,541
Before your captain
passed away I believe

90
00:06:26,625 --> 00:06:29,083
he entrusted you with a letter.

91
00:06:29,166 --> 00:06:31,583
That's right, the
Captain's last request was

92
00:06:31,666 --> 00:06:33,250
that I deliver the
letter he gave me

93
00:06:33,333 --> 00:06:36,625
to the intended
recipient upon our return.

house number 13.

That's Monsieur Noirtier...

97
00:06:44,416 --> 00:06:46,500
[MONTE CRISTO]
That letter contained the names

98
00:06:46,583 --> 00:06:48,000
of all the men involved in the

99
00:06:48,083 --> 00:06:51,458
planning of the assassination
plot against the Prince.

100
00:06:51,541 --> 00:06:54,750
But Villefort's name
was included on the list.

101
00:06:54,833 --> 00:06:58,000
And I had unwittingly
handed the letter over to him.

102
00:06:58,083 --> 00:07:02,250
A man who had much to
hide and much to answer for.

[VILLEFORT]
I see.

104

You were simply carrying out
your duties faithfully.

00:07:05,958 --> 00:07:07,083
Well then, Dantes.

106
00:07:07,166 --> 00:07:09,083
Why don't you let me
take care of this letter

107
00:07:09,166 --> 00:07:10,541
and sort things out for you?

108
00:07:10,625 --> 00:07:13,125
I expect that they'll be
releasing you soon enough.

109
00:07:13,208 --> 00:07:16,291
Thank you for all your
help, Monsieur Villefort!

[EDMOND]
How can I ever repay you?

111
00:07:18,958 --> 00:07:20,750
My fiancée must be
anxiously waiting for me

to return from this ordeal.

113
00:07:24,583 --> 00:07:27,083
[VILLEFORT]
Oh, by the way, have you spoken

114
00:07:27,166 --> 00:07:29,291
of this letter to anyone else?

00:07:29,375 --> 00:07:30,833
No, Monsieur.

116
00:07:30,916 --> 00:07:32,875
I fully obeyed the Captain's
last request and kept it secret

117
00:07:32,958 --> 00:07:35,000
from everyone,
including my father.

118
00:07:35,083 --> 00:07:36,625
[EDMOND] No one else
knows of this letter.

119
00:07:36,708 --> 00:07:38,125
Except you.

120
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:41,000

[VILLEFORT cackling]

122
00:07:48,791 --> 00:07:50,875
[MONTE CRISTO]
Here in Paris, it is believed

123
00:07:50,958 --> 00:07:52,458
that the Prince perished in an

124
00:07:52,541 --> 00:07:57,000
assassination plot orchestrated
by alien enemies of this world.

125
00:07:57,083 --> 00:08:00,791
But the plot was devised
by people here on Earth.

126
00:08:02,416 --> 00:08:04,666
Those gluttons who had reaped
enormous profits from the

127
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:09,541
never ending war wished for
it to continue raging forever.

128
00:08:09,625 --> 00:08:11,833
But that's...

129
00:08:11,916 --> 00:08:13,291
[MONTE CRISTO]
With the assassination,

130
00:08:13,375 --> 00:08:16,041
prospects for peace
became a distant memory.

131
00:08:16,125 --> 00:08:17,916
And just as those men desired,

132
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,333
the war spread
across the frontier,

133
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:23,333
growing ever more
intense with each new day,

134
00:08:23,416 --> 00:08:26,125
in the name of avenging
the assassination.

135
00:08:27,791 --> 00:08:30,916
And one poor unlucky man
was consigned to oblivion.

136
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,375
Just so they could
keep their secrets.

137
00:08:36,166 --> 00:08:38,625
Those who exploited me
and had me imprisoned

138
00:08:38,708 --> 00:08:41,875
eventually became prominent
and powerful figures

139
00:08:41,958 --> 00:08:44,750
in the legal and
financial circles of Paris.

140
00:08:44,833 --> 00:08:48,125
And the man who had climbed to
the very top of the military,

141
00:08:48,208 --> 00:08:50,833
turned his eyes
and his ambitions

to the power of the Presidency.

This isn't over yet!

322
00:20:37,416 --> 00:20:39,125
Eat this!

323
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:06,666
Hey, Albert!

324
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:08,666
[BAPTISTIN]
You crazy kid...

325
00:21:09,875 --> 00:21:12,250
[BERTUCCIO]
Where's Mondego?

326
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:18,708
[BAPTISTIN]
Tch! This ain't good...

327
00:21:18,791 --> 00:21:21,916
Father... why...

328
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,458
[FERNAND]
As long as...

329
00:21:23,541 --> 00:21:28,416
As long as that bastard is still
alive, I can't die, either!

330
00:21:46,666 --> 00:21:49,041
[FERNAND]
Monte Cristo!

331
00:21:49,125 --> 00:21:51,458
I mean, Edmond Dantes!

332
00:21:51,541 --> 00:21:53,500
I'm going to take
it all away from you,

333
00:21:53,583 --> 00:21:57,708
everything you hold dear
in life just as you did to me!

334
00:23:28,791 --> 00:23:30,625
[ALBERT] I continue to
plead, as if praying.

335
00:23:30,708 --> 00:23:32,750
To my father. To my mother.

336
00:23:32,833 --> 00:23:34,791
And most of all, to your name.

337
00:23:34,875 --> 00:23:38,166
Next Gankutsuou, The Count
of Monte Cristo, Act 23:

338
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:39,708
"Edmond Dantes".

339
00:23:39,791 --> 00:23:41,958
Bide your time,
and hold out hope!
