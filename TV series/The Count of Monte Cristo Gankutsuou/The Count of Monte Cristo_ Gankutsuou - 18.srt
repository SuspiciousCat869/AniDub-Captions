167
00:18:53,583 --> 00:18:56,125
Why did you have to do it?

168
00:18:56,208 --> 00:18:58,583
I'm sorry...

169
00:18:58,666 --> 00:19:04,916
...that everything turned
out the way that it did.

170
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,583
[FRANZ]
But...

171
00:19:06,666 --> 00:19:09,166
...you taught me how

172
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:13,000
to handle a sword in
one to one combat...

173
00:19:13,083 --> 00:19:16,583
...so I put up a
pretty good fight.

174
00:19:16,666 --> 00:19:17,875
You'd have been proud of me--

175
00:19:17,958 --> 00:19:19,250
[ALBERT]
That's enough!

176
00:19:19,333 --> 00:19:21,791
Don't...

177
00:19:22,583 --> 00:19:24,458
Don't try to talk.

178
00:19:24,541 --> 00:19:26,791
You idiot...

179
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:28,833
You still think you can...

180
00:19:28,916 --> 00:19:33,416
...boss me around...
like none of this happened

181
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:34,791
Oh no, Franz!

182
00:19:34,875 --> 00:19:36,750
Franz hang on!

183
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,750
Albert, listen...

184
00:19:44,833 --> 00:19:46,500
Last night...

185
00:19:46,583 --> 00:19:49,291
I had a wonderful dream.

186
00:19:50,791 --> 00:19:53,041
[FRANZ]
Maybe it was last year...

187
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:56,541
Or was it the
year before last?

188
00:19:57,041 --> 00:20:00,541
The two of us and Eugenie
went to Normandy together.

189
00:20:00,625 --> 00:20:01,833
Do you remember that?

190
00:20:03,708 --> 00:20:08,416
No, wait, was it in
the south of France?

191
00:20:11,333 --> 00:20:15,416
The three of us sprawled
out on the beach...

192
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:18,333
...and we celebrated
your birthday.

193
00:20:19,791 --> 00:20:22,708
It was so windy
that when we tried

194
00:20:22,791 --> 00:20:27,083
to eat a piece of cheese,
it tasted like sand...

195
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:32,333
And Eugenie's
favorite hat blew away

196
00:20:32,416 --> 00:20:34,916
in the ocean breeze...

197
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,916
She was really depressed
about it, remember?

198
00:20:41,916 --> 00:20:46,375
Happy birthday...

199
00:20:47,666 --> 00:20:53,625
Congratulations
on turning 16...

200
00:20:57,083 --> 00:20:59,458
Franz...

201
00:21:01,416 --> 00:21:06,333
[ALBERT] Franz, hang on
just a little longer...

202
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:12,500
The doctor's gonna be
here any minute now, okay?

203
00:21:14,291 --> 00:21:16,000
You're gonna be all right...

204
00:21:17,541 --> 00:21:19,750
You're gonna be all right.

205
00:21:24,625 --> 00:21:28,583
[ALBERT]
Hey, Franz...

206
00:21:28,666 --> 00:21:34,250
It's nice and warm
out here, isn't it?

207
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:38,333
Franz?

208
00:21:55,541 --> 00:21:58,208
Franz!

209
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,791
[ALBERT] Alone, I walk
through the darkness

210
00:23:30,875 --> 00:23:33,791
of the night as
I wait for the sun.

211
00:23:33,875 --> 00:23:37,333
Next Gankutsuou, The Count
of Monte Cristo, Act 19:

212
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:39,375
"Even if I Should
Stop Being Me."

213
00:23:39,458 --> 00:23:41,708
Bide your time,
and hold out hope!
