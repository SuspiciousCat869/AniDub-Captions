00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:52,125
[FARIA] At the residence
of my old friend,

2
00:01:52,208 --> 00:01:55,125
I was reunited with
the young man...

3
00:01:55,208 --> 00:01:56,916
His soul, which does not know

4
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,083
what it means to love another,

5
00:01:59,166 --> 00:02:00,625
was profoundly shaken by one

6
00:02:00,708 --> 00:02:04,208
who does know
what it is to love.

7
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:08,916
He asked, "Do you
love your fiancée?"

8
00:02:12,833 --> 00:02:15,666
My life is much like
this miniature garden.

9
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:18,708
It is a hollow,
and fragile thing.

10
00:02:34,833 --> 00:02:36,666
Father, I really think
that we should give

11
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:39,166
some more serious thought
to my marriage with Eugenie.

12
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:41,166
What brought this
on all of a sudden?

13
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:42,500
Well you see father,

14
00:02:42,583 --> 00:02:44,875
I'm just not sure if
I'm still in love with her.

15
00:02:44,958 --> 00:02:47,208
Or if I ever was.

16
00:02:47,291 --> 00:02:48,666

[ALBERT'S DAD] Is that all
that's been bothering you?

19
00:02:56,291 --> 00:02:58,166
At first you go through
the motions, Son,

20
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:00,791
and soon you the
emotions will follow. Pull!

21

Monsieur Albert, a messenger
from the Count of Monte Cristo

22
00:03:07,083 --> 00:03:08,875
said that I should
deliver this to you.

23
00:03:08,958 --> 00:03:10,583
From the Count?

24

You're right.

I'm sorry, but could you deliver
this to Eugenie for me please?

33
00:03:32,958 --> 00:03:35,208
Albert, you need to be
the one who delivers it.

34
00:03:35,291 --> 00:03:36,291
Father?

35
00:03:36,375 --> 00:03:38,125
It's considerate
little touches like this

36
00:03:38,208 --> 00:03:41,458
that will win her over
to you little by little.

Hm?

You musn't wake her up!

Has he come back?

It's Mademoiselle!

43

Good morning, Mademoiselle.
You're looking well.

Good morning.
I've come to see my mother.

So it seems Mademoiselle.

Ah...

Ah! Well, good morning, Eugenie.

You're looking
as lovely as ever.

Yes, sir. Thank you for asking.

By the way, about
Olympus Trading...

59
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,833
I'm absolutely sure of it.

60
00:05:11,916 --> 00:05:14,666
That's a very valuable
piece of information.

Thanks for the tip!

62
00:05:15,875 --> 00:05:17,208
I always see to it that people

who bring me important
information are well rewarded.

64

If you're not in
a hurry to leave,

65
00:05:22,166 --> 00:05:24,875
would you care to join us?

66
00:05:36,208 --> 00:05:38,500
Count, I really want to thank
you for the nice invitation.

67
00:05:38,583 --> 00:05:41,958
In fact, I was on my way
to give Eugenie her ticket.

68
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:45,250
It just so happens that I am on
my way to visit Baron Danglars

69
00:05:45,333 --> 00:05:47,583
regarding some
business negotiations.

70
00:05:47,666 --> 00:05:48,875
What a lucky coincidence!

71
00:05:48,958 --> 00:05:50,666
Please excellency,
you must allow me

72
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:52,083
to introduce you to them!

73
00:05:52,166 --> 00:05:54,083
This is indeed a
stroke of good luck.

74
00:05:54,166 --> 00:05:55,458
There are many
things at their estate

75
00:05:55,541 --> 00:05:57,791
that I'm certain you'll
find extremely interesting.

76
00:05:57,875 --> 00:05:59,750
That reminds me,
if you have time,

77
00:05:59,833 --> 00:06:01,958
you should ask them
to show you the stables.

78
00:06:02,041 --> 00:06:03,666
Madame Danglars has
a horse named Eclipse

79
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:06,125
that is the finest
in all of Paris.

80
00:06:10,208 --> 00:06:11,625
This way, Messieurs.

81
00:06:11,708 --> 00:06:13,625
If you would, please wait
in the parlor for a moment...

82
00:06:13,708 --> 00:06:15,291
Albert!

83
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:17,583
Lucien! What are
you doing here so early.

84
00:06:17,666 --> 00:06:20,625
Oh, I had my hands
full with this and that.

85
00:06:21,708 --> 00:06:24,291
Oh, hi! Good morning, Eugenie!

86
00:06:26,333 --> 00:06:29,458
You see a man always has
to play his cards right.

87
00:06:29,541 --> 00:06:30,333
You know?

88
00:06:30,416 --> 00:06:31,833
Good morning, Count!

89
00:06:31,916 --> 00:06:34,500
Do me the honor of allowing
me to invite you to my home.

90
00:06:34,583 --> 00:06:35,875
It would be a pleasure.

91
00:06:35,958 --> 00:06:39,208
That reminds me, I'll be
stopping by your room later!

92
00:06:51,458 --> 00:06:53,083
Michelle, it seems the
price of Olympus Trading

93
00:06:53,166 --> 00:06:55,083
has started to fall.

94
00:06:55,166 --> 00:06:56,875
We'll pretend to prop it up,

95
00:06:56,958 --> 00:06:58,333
and then make
it fall even farther!

96
00:06:58,416 --> 00:07:00,250
Further buying is inadvisable.

97
00:07:00,333 --> 00:07:02,375
It is below the insolvency line.

98
00:07:03,666 --> 00:07:06,583
Wait until it hits bottom,
and then buy them out.

99
00:07:06,666 --> 00:07:08,708
Understood, sir.

100
00:07:08,791 --> 00:07:10,250
Yes!

101
00:07:10,333 --> 00:07:13,000
A few hundred investors are
gonna hang themselves over this.

102
00:07:13,083 --> 00:07:15,375
Monsieur Baron, the Count of
Monte Cristo has arrived

103
00:07:15,458 --> 00:07:17,666
and is waiting for
you in the parlor.

104
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:19,375
He is, is he?

105
00:07:19,458 --> 00:07:20,708
Michelle, have the results

106
00:07:20,791 --> 00:07:22,958
of the credit assessment
on this Count come in yet?

107
00:07:23,041 --> 00:07:24,333
Out of three agencies,

108
00:07:24,416 --> 00:07:28,291
two rate him as AA+,
and the third rates him as AAA.

109
00:07:28,375 --> 00:07:29,833
His peerage title is valid.

110
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:33,583
I'll bet it is. He probably
paid a lot of money for it.

111
00:07:35,541 --> 00:07:38,166
I'm terribly sorry to
keep you waiting, sir.

112
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:40,541
Oh, I didn't know you
were here, too, Albert.

113
00:07:40,625 --> 00:07:41,583
Good morning, Baron.

114
00:07:41,666 --> 00:07:42,958
May I present to you
His Excellency,

115
00:07:43,041 --> 00:07:44,583
the Count of Monte Cristo.

116
00:07:44,666 --> 00:07:46,916
I was hoping to put
in a good word for him.

117
00:07:48,041 --> 00:07:50,416
His Excellency mentioned to
me that he had not yet found

118
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,625
himself a suitable
a bank here in Paris,

119
00:07:52,708 --> 00:07:54,500
so I thought It would
be best for all concerned

120
00:07:54,583 --> 00:07:56,333
if I introduced
him to you, Baron.

121
00:07:56,416 --> 00:07:58,500
That was most
considerate of you, Albert.

122
00:07:58,583 --> 00:07:59,708
Of course, I'm
always happy to meet

123
00:07:59,791 --> 00:08:01,916
fine new customers to our firm.

124
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,916
Allow me to introduce Baron
Danglars, your Excellency.

125
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,916
The most powerful
banker in Paris.

126
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,333
It is a pleasure to make
your acquaintance, sir.

127
00:08:14,583 --> 00:08:15,833
You missed a
spot over here, too!

128
00:08:15,916 --> 00:08:17,208
This is unacceptable.

129
00:08:17,291 --> 00:08:19,458
You need to be more careful
with Eclipse's grooming.

130
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:20,750
Yes, Madame.

131
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:22,625
And be sure that you
never give him anything

132
00:08:22,708 --> 00:08:24,666
except the feed
that I have specified.

133
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:26,541
Yes, Madame.

134
00:08:27,375 --> 00:08:28,833
I've received a
letter of introduction

135
00:08:28,916 --> 00:08:32,083
and contracts from the
firm of Thomson &amp; French.

136
00:08:32,166 --> 00:08:34,333
To tell you the truth, sir,
I'm more than a little amazed

137
00:08:34,416 --> 00:08:37,541
that they would act as
guarantor for an individual.

138
00:08:37,625 --> 00:08:40,750
They are the largest banking
firm in Eastern Space.

139
00:08:40,833 --> 00:08:42,166
Indeed they are.

140
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:44,833
However, there is one item
we found in this contact

141
00:08:44,916 --> 00:08:46,791
that leaves me
with some concerns.

142
00:08:46,875 --> 00:08:48,833
Oh? What concerns you?

143
00:08:48,916 --> 00:08:50,291
According to this contract,

144
00:08:50,375 --> 00:08:53,208
no upper limit has been
set to your line of credit.

145
00:08:53,291 --> 00:08:54,666
In short, this
could be interpreted

146
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:56,500
to mean that my bank
would have to provide you

147
00:08:56,583 --> 00:08:59,916
with unlimited credit for an
indefinite period of time...

148
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,208
...with any amount
you asked for,

149
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:03,166
no matter how great the sum.

150
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:05,500
And does that
present a problem?

151
00:09:05,583 --> 00:09:06,708
[DANGLARS laughs]

152
00:09:06,791 --> 00:09:09,208
Well, Sir, this is a
rather awkward situation.

153
00:09:09,291 --> 00:09:10,916
You say it as
if it were nothing,

154
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,916
but such lopsided deals
don't exist in the world

155
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
of responsible businessmen.

156
00:09:15,083 --> 00:09:17,541
Be that as it may, Baron,
the firm of Thomson &amp; French

157
00:09:17,625 --> 00:09:19,958
has judged that
in my case, they do.

158
00:09:20,041 --> 00:09:21,500
Surely, Sir,
you aren't doubting

159
00:09:21,583 --> 00:09:23,541
the validity of this
contract are you?

160
00:09:23,625 --> 00:09:26,291
Not at all, I've

00:17:15,583 --> 00:17:19,166
but I'm feeling a bit
out of place right now.

322
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:21,875
Not at all.
That's a nice suit.

323
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:25,708
Huh? Oh this?
I had to borrow it.

324
00:17:31,375 --> 00:17:32,583
Uh...

325
00:17:36,125 --> 00:17:43,000
[indistinct chatter]

326
00:17:49,791 --> 00:17:51,583
[WOMAN 1] But I thought that the
Prince's booth had been sealed

327
00:17:51,666 --> 00:17:54,500
and remained unused ever
since that infamous incident.

328
00:17:54,583 --> 00:17:56,041
[WOMAON 2] Do you
realize it's been 20 years

329
00:17:56,125 --> 00:17:57,666
since that horrible accident?

330
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:59,500
I heard that someone
put the Princes' box

331
00:17:59,583 --> 00:18:00,666
on permanent reserve.

332
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:02,125
Unnerving, isn't it?

333
00:18:02,208 --> 00:18:04,458
It's as if the late Prince
has returned from the dead.

334
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:07,000
Such frightful things
to be talking about...

00:18:34,291 --> 00:18:35,625
What a handsome gentleman...

338
00:18:35,708 --> 00:18:37,875
Who is the young
lady standing next to him?

339
00:18:37,958 --> 00:18:39,250
I don't know,

340
00:18:39,333 --> 00:18:42,750
but isn't she the loveliest
thing you've ever seen?

341
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:51,291
Hey, Albert, who is
your handsome friend?

342

[knocking on door]

343
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:56,916
Pardon Madame!

such a racket...

What did you say?!

348
00:19:10,291 --> 00:19:12,041
A brand new set of
box seats was unveiled

Ah, it must be that
Count of Monte Cristo.

351
00:19:16,291 --> 00:19:18,000
Where are his seats?

Uh...

00:19:21,041 --> 00:19:22,291
But that's...

354
00:19:22,375 --> 00:19:24,250
That's the late Prince's box!

355

What's the meaning of this?!

356

I haven't been given
the details, Monsieur.

Oh my, how can this be?!

00:19:58,875 --> 00:20:01,000
I can't believe it!

362
00:20:01,625 --> 00:20:03,833
The Count of
Monte Cristo ordered me

363
00:20:03,916 --> 00:20:05,791
to give this to Madame...

364
