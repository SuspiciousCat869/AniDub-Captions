of his mother's past,

the young man saw in her

However, for all his curiosity,
he is still unaware.

5
00:02:08,333 --> 00:02:11,083
Still unaware of the
true identity of the man

the look on her face.

Amazing. I can't believe

It's like a dream.

10
00:02:55,625 --> 00:02:58,000
Perhaps this truly
is but a dream.

At times, I do
consider that possibility.

Well, in that case, here's an
eye-opening question for you.

How much did you
sink into this place?

14

How much did this
dream house set you back?

We stopped bothering
with hassles like money,

through construction.

17

a great headline.

She's beautiful...

You're not gonna try and tell us

Don't be rude!

27
00:03:47,416 --> 00:03:48,625
It's obvious that she's...

28
00:03:48,708 --> 00:03:51,541
She is nothing more
than a doll named Haidee.

A poor puppet who still lives,

Welcome, all of you to our home.

My name is Haidee.

Hello.

He is called Ali.

in my possession.

Haidee, the Viscount seems
quite perplexed by all of this.

He's confused as
to what you are to me.

60
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:16,500
Viscount, I am a
small but humble twig,

Well, how do you like that.

63
00:05:21,083 --> 00:05:23,083
A graceful girl
like her is the twig,

64
00:05:23,166 --> 00:05:25,583
and the big bad
Count is the flower?

65
00:05:25,666 --> 00:05:28,500
Miss Haidee,
are you happy like this?

66
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,333
I know the joy of making
beautiful flowers bloom.

68
00:05:39,291 --> 00:05:42,666
Does the music coming from
my harp seem gloomy to you?

69
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:44,708
Well, no.

70
00:05:44,791 --> 00:05:47,500
The notes of a harp are
the notes of the heart.

71
00:05:47,583 --> 00:05:50,208
The strings don't
respond to a timid heart,

72
00:05:50,291 --> 00:05:54,500
A tense and troubled heart
can cause the strings to break.

73
00:05:54,583 --> 00:05:56,541
Being here with the
Count is the only thing

74
00:05:56,625 --> 00:05:58,666
that makes my heart happy.

75
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:01,750
I, uh... I assume that you two
were in love with one another

76

and that's why you
got together right?

00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:08,291
Could you really be
as naïve as all that?

What do you mean by that?

00:06:10,083 --> 00:06:11,666
Think about it, Albert...

81
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:14,000
Marriage among aristocrats
is a strategic alliance

82
00:06:14,083 --> 00:06:15,958
with the goal of
securing an estate.

83
00:06:16,041 --> 00:06:19,416
In fact, that's why Franz and
Valentine are engaged, right?

84
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:22,541
Huh? Is that really true?!

85
00:06:22,625 --> 00:06:28,000
Um... Well, I guess I really
can't deny it, right, Albert?

Isn't it the same
with you and Eugenie?

Yeah I guess so...

88
00:06:32,416 --> 00:06:33,916
In other words,
love is something

89
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,666
that just doesn't exist
in the privileged class.

00:10:14,833 --> 00:10:18,083
Let's see you go
at it, pirate style!

164
00:10:19,958 --> 00:10:22,125
It's hard to believe
that there are still people

165
00:10:22,208 --> 00:10:24,500
in this day and age
who'd fight a duel over love...

166
00:10:24,583 --> 00:10:26,375
Hey, Those swords are real!

167
00:10:26,458 --> 00:10:27,833
Is this any time to be joking?!

168
00:10:27,916 --> 00:10:29,958
Yes! And the water
down there is teeming

169
00:10:30,041 --> 00:10:32,291
with sharks thirsting
for human blood!

170
00:10:32,375 --> 00:10:33,958
Huh? Wait a minute!

171
00:10:34,041 --> 00:10:36,000
What kind of game are
you playing here, Count?

172
00:10:36,083 --> 00:10:38,750
Just the entertainment
of a sea voyage.

173
00:10:38,833 --> 00:10:41,083
I expect that
Monsieur Albert is thirsting

174
00:10:41,166 --> 00:10:43,583
for stimulation of this sort.

175
00:10:47,916 --> 00:10:48,875
Let's do it!

176
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:51,916
En guard!

177
00:11:26,333 --> 00:11:27,166
Take back your words!

178
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:28,208
Take it all back!

179
00:11:28,291 --> 00:11:28,833
I can't!

180
00:11:28,916 --> 00:11:30,291
Why, you--!

181
00:11:38,333 --> 00:11:39,833
And now?!

182
00:11:39,916 --> 00:11:42,333
You poor, sad people...

183
00:11:48,083 --> 00:11:50,291
The purer the heart,
the keener the blade.

184
00:11:50,375 --> 00:11:53,875
I'm afraid you just aren't
capable of defeating me.

185
00:11:54,583 --> 00:11:56,000
Shut up!

186
00:12:00,125 --> 00:12:03,333
Understand. No matter
what you wanna say,

187
00:12:03,416 --> 00:12:05,125
no matter how
other families are...

188
00:12:05,208 --> 00:12:08,375
...my parents' marriage
bond is sacred!

189
00:12:08,458 --> 00:12:11,375
I didn't expect you to turn
towards your unarmed side.

190
00:12:11,458 --> 00:12:14,166
And I do admire the
strength of your actions.

191
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:20,125
However, the insincere will be
smitten by divine retribution!

192
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:27,625
I won't stand for it! I won't!

193
00:12:27,708 --> 00:12:28,791
What is with Maximilien?

194
00:12:28,875 --> 00:12:30,791
What in the world's
gotten into him?

195
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:34,666
I guess he's
the scrupulous type.

196
00:12:36,125 --> 00:12:38,500
You're finished!

197
00:12:38,833 --> 00:12:41,250
Why is it that you hate
the aristocracy so much?!

198
00:12:41,333 --> 00:12:43,166
That's none of your business!

199
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:44,916
The hell it isn't!
You tell me why!

200
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,875
First, I've something
to ask you.

201
00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:48,125
Is it true what I've heard?

202
00:12:48,208 --> 00:12:50,791
That you don't really
love your fiancée?

203
00:12:50,875 --> 00:12:51,875
Well, I--

204
00:12:51,958 --> 00:12:53,833
I demand an answer!

205
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,541
I don't know! Okay?

206
00:12:58,041 --> 00:12:59,458
Just as I thought.

207
00:12:59,541 --> 00:13:01,958
I can't abide by this anymore!

208
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:13,916
You have lost, Messieurs.

209
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,583
Ah!

210
00:13:29,708 --> 00:13:32,000
Hey, hold it!

211
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:33,916
Ah!

212
00:13:36,375 --> 00:13:37,750
Albert!

213
00:13:42,208 --> 00:13:42,958
Don't!

214
00:13:43,041 --> 00:13:45,208
There are sharks down there!

215
00:13:46,833 --> 00:13:48,000
This is a nightmare...

216
00:13:48,083 --> 00:13:50,416
Indeed it is.

217
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,958
You see, this is a dream.

218
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:55,083
A waking dream...

219
00:13:55,166 --> 00:13:57,458
A twilight dream.

220
00:14:11,541 --> 00:14:12,916
[ALBERT'S MOM]
Albert...

221
00:14:13,666 --> 00:14:15,041
[ALBERT]
Mother...

222
00:14:15,125 --> 00:14:18,000
I did it because Mother
had that look on her face...

223
00:14:28,458 --> 00:14:29,708
Count...

224
00:14:29,791 --> 00:14:32,833
[MONTE CRISTO] One cannot
fight against destiny.

225
00:14:32,916 --> 00:14:34,083
[ALBERT]
Huh?

226
00:15:02,041 --> 00:15:03,750
[ALBERT]
I'm ashamed of myself.

227
00:15:03,833 --> 00:15:06,541
I can't believe
how angry I got.

228
00:15:06,625 --> 00:15:11,291
[MONTE CRISTO] I know.
I can see it clearly.

229
00:15:11,375 --> 00:15:15,583
Within your heart, another
side of yourself lies dormant.

230
00:15:15,666 --> 00:15:16,916
Huh?

231
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,416
At the moment,
you are burdened

232
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,541
with a profound
sense of apprehension.

233
00:15:23,375 --> 00:15:25,041
Just as I am.

234
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:26,500
You are?

235
00:15:29,416 --> 00:15:32,291
My good Viscount Albert
I have need of you.

236
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,500
Who, me?

237
00:15:35,583 --> 00:15:38,708
You recall that day on
Luna when you and I met?

238
00:15:38,791 --> 00:15:43,166
Perhaps you feel that our
meeting was a chance encounter.

239
00:15:44,166 --> 00:15:48,000
But in fate, there
are no coincidences.

240
00:15:49,166 --> 00:15:51,750
Just as that setting
sun does so according

241
00:15:51,833 --> 00:15:54,125
to the laws of the universe,

242
00:15:54,208 --> 00:15:56,125
fate, too, is composed of

243
00:15:56,208 --> 00:16:00,791
the powerful natural forces
of unyielding necessity.

244
00:16:06,625 --> 00:16:07,916
But what are you
apprehensive about?

245
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,500
It's because a man
loves with all his heart,

246
00:16:10,583 --> 00:16:14,166
that he laughs,
and loves, and hates.

247
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:18,000
What are you saying,
I guess I don't understand.

248
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:26,166
You see, Albert my life, is
much like this miniature garden.

249
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:29,791
It is a hollow,
and fragile thing.

250
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,500
Aw, c'mon, Albert.

251
00:16:42,583 --> 00:16:44,375
Why don't you cheer up already.

252
00:16:44,458 --> 00:16:47,541
Maximilien apologized for
everything he said, didn't he?

253
00:16:47,625 --> 00:16:49,500
I'm not mad, Franz.

254
00:16:49,583 --> 00:16:51,375
Then why--

255
00:16:57,083 --> 00:17:00,666
Look, Don't hang around
the Count anymore, all right?

256
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:02,750
You've been acting funny lately.

257
00:17:03,791 --> 00:17:07,250
Yeah, you're right.
I guess I have.

258
00:17:07,333 --> 00:17:08,500
Something's funny.

259
00:17:08,583 --> 00:17:10,541
There's something
strange about all this.

260
00:17:10,625 --> 00:17:11,750
Up until yesterday,

261
00:17:11,833 --> 00:17:14,541
life was one uneventful
day after another.

262
00:17:14,625 --> 00:17:17,833
It almost feels
like something hidden

263
00:17:17,916 --> 00:17:20,750
is at work behind all this.

264
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:23,625
Destiny...

265
00:17:23,708 --> 00:17:27,250
Have you ever thought
about you know fate?

266
00:17:27,333 --> 00:17:28,583
I haven't.

267
00:17:28,666 --> 00:17:31,833
I really don't believe
in any that stuff.

268
00:17:35,875 --> 00:17:38,041
How did your mother and I meet?

269
00:17:38,125 --> 00:17:40,750
Why the sudden
interest in that Albert?

270
00:17:40,833 --> 00:17:42,291
Please, I'd just like to know.

271
00:17:42,375 --> 00:17:43,416
Humph.

272
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:44,958
As I've told you before,

273
00:17:45,041 --> 00:17:48,583
your mother and I were married
after a storybook courtship.

274
00:17:51,333 --> 00:17:52,875
Yes, that's true.

275
00:17:52,958 --> 00:17:55,375
It was just as your father says.

276
00:18:02,375 --> 00:18:05,833
I've never seen that look
on Mother's face before.

277
00:18:07,833 --> 00:18:12,250
You look like you're delirious
with a fever, young master.

278
00:18:12,333 --> 00:18:14,250
Why don't you go
out for some fresh air?

279
00:18:14,333 --> 00:18:16,708
Make sure you clean in here!

280
00:18:18,083 --> 00:18:19,750
Yes, sir!

281
00:18:39,625 --> 00:18:43,125
[ALBERT thinking]Mother,
who are you thinking about

282
00:18:43,208 --> 00:18:45,125
right now at
this very moment?

283
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:54,833
I wonder.

284
00:18:54,916 --> 00:18:57,833
How far will the
ship really sail?

285
00:18:58,708 --> 00:19:02,750
Well, there is
no turning back now.

286
00:19:17,458 --> 00:19:18,708
I see...

287
00:19:18,791 --> 00:19:20,625
You hope to expand
your business ventures

288
00:19:20,708 --> 00:19:22,958
to include Paris, do you?

289
00:19:23,041 --> 00:19:24,625
I can think of
no stronger backer

290
00:19:24,708 --> 00:19:28,291
to have than yourself,
General Morcerf.

291
00:19:29,625 --> 00:19:32,333
You do me a great
honor Monsieur,

292
00:19:32,416 --> 00:19:34,416
Count of Monte Cristo.

293
00:19:36,333 --> 00:19:39,041
I take it that you already
have a plan of action.

294
00:19:39,125 --> 00:19:40,416
Please feel free to call on me

295
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,750
should you have
any needs at all.

296
00:19:52,541 --> 00:19:54,291
He seems to be quite powerful.

297
00:19:54,375 --> 00:19:57,041
The crest of the Danglar
family can be seen here

298
00:19:57,125 --> 00:19:59,375
and there in every part of town.

299
00:20:00,208 --> 00:20:03,166
He has no idea that the Count
is keeping a eye on him.

300
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:05,291
Talk about conceited...

301
00:20:06,625 --> 00:20:09,333
Waving a sword around
in anger like that...

302
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:12,291
You really are hopeless,
you know that?

303
00:20:16,375 --> 00:20:18,208
Tell me, what kind
of relationship

304
00:20:18,291 --> 00:20:21,875
do you think
that you and I have?

305
00:20:21,958 --> 00:20:23,708
So what brought that on?

306
00:20:23,791 --> 00:20:26,416
It's something that
Maximilien said to me.

307
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:30,916
He asked me if it was true
that I didn't love my fiancée.

308
00:20:31,958 --> 00:20:35,333
Oh. How did you answer that?

309
00:20:35,416 --> 00:20:36,791
Huh, Albert?

310
00:20:36,875 --> 00:20:39,791
Uh... Hm...

311
00:20:42,166 --> 00:20:45,000
You and I... are childhood
friends, aren't we?

312
00:20:45,083 --> 00:20:46,750
Ah!

313
00:20:46,833 --> 00:20:49,000
I think that you and
Franz have changed.

314
00:20:49,083 --> 00:20:52,291
It used to be the three
of us always had fun.

315
00:20:52,375 --> 00:20:55,291
But now, the two
of you sneak off.

316
00:20:55,375 --> 00:20:58,916
Too bad. Everybody's changing.

317
00:21:00,875 --> 00:21:03,666
Do you know why
Maximilien was so angry?

318
00:21:05,583 --> 00:21:07,833
You honestly don't know?

319
00:21:09,541 --> 00:21:11,041
Well, if you say so.

320
00:21:11,125 --> 00:21:13,000
What do you mean by that?

321
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:15,458
I guess...

322
00:21:15,541 --> 00:21:17,875
...no one can do
anything to stop it...

323
00:21:17,958 --> 00:21:21,291
...when two people find they
have feelings for each other.

324
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:26,750
I didn't mean to
keep you waiting.

325
00:21:26,833 --> 00:21:28,083
I'm sorry, dear.

326
00:21:28,166 --> 00:21:30,500
It took me a long
time to get ready.

327
00:21:30,583 --> 00:21:31,583
That's all right.

328
00:21:31,666 --> 00:21:34,375
Oh, my. Albert,
is something the matter?

329
00:21:34,458 --> 00:21:36,166
You look so very grim.

330
00:21:40,083 --> 00:21:41,416
Take care, Eugenie.

331
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:44,166
Hey, Albert! Wait a minute!

332
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:45,875
Albert!

333
00:23:28,958 --> 00:23:31,000
[ALBERT] She and her father.
And her mother.

334
00:23:31,083 --> 00:23:33,125
The specter of uncertainty
sneaks up on them

335
00:23:33,208 --> 00:23:34,458
through their emotions.

336
00:23:34,541 --> 00:23:37,916
Next Gankutsuou,
The Count of Monte Cristo,

337
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,166
Act 6: "Her Melancholy,
My Melancholy".

338
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:42,166
Bide your time,
and hold out hope!
