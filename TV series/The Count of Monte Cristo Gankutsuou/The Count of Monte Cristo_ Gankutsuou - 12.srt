00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:52,041
[FARIA] Madams and Monsieurs,
good evening.

2
00:01:52,125 --> 00:01:54,333
The girl sleeping in the
house of the poisoner

3
00:01:54,416 --> 00:01:57,208
was saved thanks to the
pure souls of the young men

4
00:01:57,291 --> 00:02:00,416
who were her friends
and confidants

5
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:03,375
However, the next
misfortune silently creeps up

6
00:02:03,458 --> 00:02:06,000
and suddenly appears before us.

7
00:02:06,083 --> 00:02:08,208
Indeed, just like
that single letter that

8
00:02:08,291 --> 00:02:11,666
was delivered to
an innocent soul.

10
00:02:34,958 --> 00:02:36,416
Excuse me?

11
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:37,833
What did you say?

12
00:02:37,916 --> 00:02:40,541
Father! Did I hear you right?

13
00:02:40,625 --> 00:02:41,750
Yes.

14
00:02:41,833 --> 00:02:43,791
I've called off your
engagement to Albert...

15
00:02:45,166 --> 00:02:47,250
That's all there
is to it. All right?

16
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:48,958
What's the meaning of this?

17
00:02:49,041 --> 00:02:50,791
Why, father?!

18
00:02:50,875 --> 00:02:53,125
I've been hearing
some unsavory rumors

19
00:02:53,208 --> 00:02:55,000
regarding the Morcerfs.

20
00:02:55,083 --> 00:02:58,083
But that doesn't mean you--
I can't believe this!

21
00:02:58,166 --> 00:02:59,500
I don't get it.

22
00:02:59,583 --> 00:03:01,166
You never wanted to marry him.

23
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:05,708
In fact, if I recall, you were
very upset about it at first.

24
00:03:05,791 --> 00:03:07,541
It seems that you
don't understand much

25
00:03:07,625 --> 00:03:08,958
about anything, do you?

26
00:03:09,041 --> 00:03:11,250
So stop treating my
life like it was one of

27
00:03:11,333 --> 00:03:13,708
your own personal
stocks or bonds!

28
00:03:14,625 --> 00:03:16,333
Here's a quick lesson for you.

29
00:03:16,416 --> 00:03:18,833
In this world, there's
only two kinds of people,

30
00:03:18,916 --> 00:03:20,500
winners and losers.

31
00:03:20,583 --> 00:03:22,583
Eugenie.

32
00:03:22,666 --> 00:03:25,750
I'm only thinking of
what's best for you.

33
00:03:25,833 --> 00:03:27,000
Liar.

34
00:03:27,083 --> 00:03:29,375
It's what's best for YOU!

35
00:03:36,833 --> 00:03:38,916
Damn it, Mondego...

36
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,875
You really blew it.

37
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,791
Sorry, but I plan to
make it through this.

38
00:03:46,791 --> 00:03:48,708
I must say, it's hard to believe

39
00:03:48,791 --> 00:03:51,208
you're the Mondego
I used to know.

40
00:03:51,291 --> 00:03:53,250
You've done well for yourself.

41
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:56,625
Really. And how
do you know that?

42
00:03:58,583 --> 00:04:02,666
A certain gentleman I know,
told me a lot about you.

43
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:04,166
Who was it?! Tell me!!

44
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:10,875
I can't tell you...

45
00:04:10,958 --> 00:04:13,375
But that's not important.

46
00:04:14,416 --> 00:04:17,291
What do you want? How much?

47
00:04:19,958 --> 00:04:22,416
Gimme everything!
All you've got!

48
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:23,708
If you wanna keep
me from talking,

49
00:04:23,791 --> 00:04:26,500
stuff my mouth with gold!

50
00:04:33,333 --> 00:04:36,083
It's an honor to see
you again, Mademoiselle.

51
00:04:37,208 --> 00:04:39,250
Marquis Cavalcanti?

52
00:04:39,333 --> 00:04:41,208
You here on business?

53
00:04:41,291 --> 00:04:43,833
Yes, I have a meeting
with your father.

54
00:04:43,916 --> 00:04:47,250
What, more financial dealings?

55
00:04:47,333 --> 00:04:48,875
I was hoping that
I could perhaps help you

56
00:04:48,958 --> 00:04:50,791
in some way or another.

57
00:04:54,083 --> 00:04:58,958
Whatever causes you sorrow,
I wish to make it go away.

58
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:03,208
You have absolutely no
reason to do that for me.

59
00:05:04,833 --> 00:05:08,583
Does a man need a
reason to love a woman?

60
00:05:11,541 --> 00:05:13,750
No! Let go of me!

61
00:05:14,666 --> 00:05:16,250
Touch me and I'll scream!

62
00:05:16,333 --> 00:05:19,958
You're acquainted with the Count
of Monte Cristo, aren't you?

63
00:05:20,875 --> 00:05:23,583
The gossip
regarding the Morcerfs...

64
00:05:23,666 --> 00:05:27,083
...was apparently leaked
by the Count himself.

65
00:05:27,875 --> 00:05:29,000
What are you saying?

66
00:05:29,083 --> 00:05:30,250
Of course...

67
00:05:30,333 --> 00:05:32,791
I find it unlikely that
the Count's information

68
00:05:32,875 --> 00:05:34,625
would be incorrect.

69
00:05:34,708 --> 00:05:35,625
I don't understand.

70
00:05:35,708 --> 00:05:37,958
Why are you telling me this?

71
00:05:39,291 --> 00:05:42,250
The thought of seeing
sadness on your face...

72
00:05:42,333 --> 00:05:43,875
...is painful.

73
00:05:44,416 --> 00:05:45,666
Cut it out.

74
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:48,125
There's no reason for you
to be in love with me.

75
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:58,083
Why would the Count of Monte
Cristo do such a thing...?

76
00:06:06,375 --> 00:06:07,416
I wonder what she thinks

77
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,875
about the engagement
being called off?

78
00:06:11,333 --> 00:06:13,458
[PEPPO] Why don't
you just ask the girl?

79
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:21,083
No, this problem might be a lot
bigger than just the two of us.

80
00:06:21,166 --> 00:06:23,666
Albert you're...

81
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:26,041
...serious about her.

82
00:06:27,125 --> 00:06:29,166
I guess it's true that
you don't realize

83
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:32,958
how important something
is until you lose it.

84
00:06:35,416 --> 00:06:36,583
My goodness.

85
00:06:36,666 --> 00:06:39,375
Now this is what
I call amazing...

86
00:06:39,458 --> 00:06:41,833
This is your daughter's
big night, after all.

87
00:06:41,916 --> 00:06:43,916
Money is no object.

88
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,208
My daughter is a lucky girl.

89
00:06:46,291 --> 00:06:47,958
Let's face it, she never
would have been able

90
00:06:48,041 --> 00:06:51,000
to sell out the opera house
simply on her own merits.

91
00:06:51,083 --> 00:06:52,166
This would never have happened

92
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:54,791
without your gracious
support Monsieur.

93
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:57,333
So...

94
00:06:57,416 --> 00:06:59,166
...are you willing to
go along with this?

95
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:02,541
Breaking your
engagement to Albert?

96
00:07:02,625 --> 00:07:03,958
It's hardly breaking it off.

97
00:07:04,041 --> 00:07:06,875
I mean, nothing had
even started between us.

98
00:07:06,958 --> 00:07:09,583
Maybe, but... the two of you
were engaged, after all.

99
00:07:09,666 --> 00:07:11,583
This was decided by...

100
00:07:11,666 --> 00:07:13,875
...both our families.

101
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:15,666
Yeah?

102
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:17,916
Then why do you
seem so hurt by it?

103
00:07:19,208 --> 00:07:20,583
Who is he?

104
00:07:20,666 --> 00:07:22,708
Who's this
Count of Monte Cristo?

105
00:07:22,791 --> 00:07:25,666
Why are you asking?
Did he do something?

106
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:27,583
He's manipulating things.

107
00:07:27,666 --> 00:07:29,750
I'm sure he was the
source of the bad rumors

108
00:07:29,833 --> 00:07:32,875
about Albert's family
that my father's been hearing.

109
00:07:32,958 --> 00:07:34,833
Bad rumors?

110
00:07:34,916 --> 00:07:38,708
When it comes to that political
gossip, I really don't care...

111
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:42,541
...but Albert hasn't been the
same since he met the Count.

112
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,875
Hey Franz don't
you miss the old days?

113
00:07:45,958 --> 00:07:47,583
The three of us would
run around the meadow,

114
00:07:47,666 --> 00:07:50,250
not even noticing when
the sun went down.

115
00:07:54,791 --> 00:07:56,125
When did it start?

116
00:07:56,208 --> 00:07:59,583
When did we start being so
awkward around each other,

117
00:07:59,666 --> 00:08:02,333
not even able to
hold hands anymore?

118
00:08:05,083 --> 00:08:08,875
When you two were on Luna,
what happened to you?

119
00:08:08,958 --> 00:08:10,125
Neither one of you...

120
00:08:10,208 --> 00:08:12,666
...has been the
same since that trip.

121
00:08:21,541 --> 00:08:22,958
No, we haven't.

122
00:08:23,041 --> 00:08:24,166
And what about Albert?

123
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:26,916
What does he think about
what's been happening?

124
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,375
I haven't heard
from him at all.

125
00:08:29,458 --> 00:08:31,708
Has he said
anything to you?

126
00:08:31,791 --> 00:08:34,541
Aren't you...
best friends with him?

127
00:08:34,625 --> 00:08:37,166
Best friends, right...

128
00:08:50,208 --> 00:08:52,541
Franz, is something wrong?

129
00:08:52,625 --> 00:08:54,208
I'm sorry.

130
00:08:54,291 --> 00:08:57,416
I don't really understand
him these days, either.

131
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:58,500
Hey wait a minute.

132
00:08:58,583 --> 00:09:01,083
Did something happen?

133
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:02,375
We got into a fight.

134
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:04,041
Huh?

135
00:09:04,125 --> 00:09:08,125
Albert shouldn't associate
with the Count anymore...

136
00:09:11,458 --> 00:09:13,666
Thanks a lot,
Franz for lending an ear.

137
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:16,166
Sorry I couldn't
be more helpful.

138
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:17,666
Still...

139
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:19,000
What?

140
00:09:19,083 --> 00:09:20,083
I'm relieved.

141
00:09:20,166 --> 00:09:21,250
Huh?

142
00:09:21,333 --> 00:09:22,541
Well...

143
00:09:22,625 --> 00:09:24,416
Whatever you might say
when it comes to Albert

144
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:27,375
it looks like the truth is
that you really do care.

145
00:09:28,458 --> 00:09:31,291
Is it that obvious?

146
00:09:31,375 --> 00:09:34,333
No one can hide when
they're pining away

147
00:09:34,416 --> 00:09:35,958
for someone they love.

148
00:09:38,458 --> 00:09:39,583
I was thinking.

149
00:09:39,666 --> 00:09:41,291
Maybe the reason your
piano performance

150
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:43,083
that night at
Auteuil was great...

151
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:46,416
...was because you were
really playing it for Albert.

152
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:48,541
No way...

153
00:09:48,625 --> 00:09:49,875
But your feelings,

154
00:09:49,958 --> 00:09:52,583
always manifest
themselves in your art.

155
00:09:52,666 --> 00:09:54,125
Aren't I right?

156
00:10:17,291 --> 00:10:19,625
Yeah, he wouldn't be here...

157
00:10:22,375 --> 00:10:25,666
After all, he and
I are still fighting...

158
00:10:35,583 --> 00:10:38,875
Yeah, he wouldn't be here...

159
00:10:51,625 --> 00:10:53,291
What's keeping her?

160
00:10:53,375 --> 00:10:55,291
Isn't Eugenie
ready yet?!

161
00:10:55,375 --> 00:10:58,166
She's still
preparing Monseiur.

162
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,791
Mademoiselle , are you
sure you're feeling all right?

163
00:11:01,875 --> 00:11:03,375
I'm fine.

164
00:11:03,458 --> 00:11:07,291
Tonights performance is the one
I've dreamt of my whole life.

165
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:14,125
[MERCEDES] It's the
strangest thing.

166
00:11:14,208 --> 00:11:17,083
Unlike the way it is
outside of the city walls,

167
00:11:17,166 --> 00:11:21,291
the grapevines always bear
fruit no matter the season.

168
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:24,458
What is it?

169
00:11:25,666 --> 00:11:28,416
Albert, dear...

170
00:11:28,875 --> 00:11:32,708
...you should always listen
to your inner feelings.

171
00:11:32,791 --> 00:11:34,875
You can't fool
yourself into feeling

172
00:11:34,958 --> 00:11:37,750
a certain way about somebody.

173
00:11:40,125 --> 00:11:44,583
Yeah, well, have you always
been true to yourself, Mother?

174
00:11:46,916 --> 00:11:48,416
This is Paris.

175
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,083
Perhaps it truly
is a paradise

176
00:11:50,166 --> 00:11:53,083
where you can find
whatever your heart desires.

177
00:11:54,416 --> 00:11:57,208
But then again,
if you lose your courage,

178
00:11:57,291 --> 00:12:00,250
you'll simply be swept
along with the currents.

179
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:21,416
You're not going to
show up... are you Albert?

180
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,666
Are you looking
for someone?

181
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:30,958

182
00:12:32,416 --> 00:12:33,250

183
00:12:33,333 --> 00:12:35,916
Mother invited you, didn't she?

184
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,500
She's very kind.

185
00:12:37,583 --> 00:12:41,333
I've decided to dedicate my
performance tonight to lovers.

186
00:12:41,416 --> 00:12:43,458
I hope that you and
Mother will enjoy it.

187
00:12:43,541 --> 00:12:44,583
No.

188
00:12:44,666 --> 00:12:46,833
This evening, you
should play for yourself

189
00:12:46,916 --> 00:12:48,708
and for the person
that you love.

190

Pianists are allowed
to do that, you know.

That's easy for
you to say...

192
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,583
Right.

193
00:13:08,166 --> 00:13:09,625
Ah, Albert.

194
00:13:09,708 --> 00:13:11,166
I'm sorry, but
the hall is filled

195

196
00:13:13,916 --> 00:13:16,083
But Monsieur,
I have an invitation.

197
00:13:16,166 --> 00:13:17,708
Eugenie gave it to me.

198
00:13:17,791 --> 00:13:18,875
Hmph!

Let's just pretend
it never happened.

But Barron, I was invited
to come by Eugenie!

202

You can not turn me away!

You have no right!

Well, well. Did you get
that firey hot temper

of yours from your father?

This has nothing
to do with my father!

I'm coming in!

208
00:13:40,541 --> 00:13:43,291
And just how are you
going to accomplish that?

209
00:13:43,375 --> 00:13:44,333
No power...

210

It's quite disturbing.

Oh, you were invited, too?

Yes, by Madame.

My wife seems to be feeling
a little out of sorts tonight.

220

You wouldn't mind keeping her
company for me, would you?

00:23:32,125 --> 00:23:33,208
When I go to visit the Count,

330
00:23:33,291 --> 00:23:35,083
I speak with Haidee
for the first time.

331
00:23:35,166 --> 00:23:37,458
Next Gankutsuou,
The Count of Monte Cristo,

332
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:39,833
Act 13: "Hadee".

333
00:23:39,916 --> 00:23:41,458
Bide your time,
and hold out hope!
