1
00:01:49,291 --> 00:01:53,166
[FARIA] Madams and
Messieurs, good evening.

2
00:01:53,708 --> 00:01:55,666
Poison has taken
a beautiful girl

3
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:58,541
and turned her into
a sleeping beauty.

4
00:01:58,916 --> 00:02:01,125
A letter from a dead
man led three men

5
00:02:01,208 --> 00:02:04,291
back to dark and
loathsome memories.

6
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:09,541
I can hear it, the beautiful
melody entitled "Nightmare"

7
00:02:09,625 --> 00:02:12,083
that my friend is playing...

8
00:02:21,333 --> 00:02:22,541
My Papa's here.

9
00:02:22,625 --> 00:02:24,208
Now you're gonna get it.

10
00:02:24,291 --> 00:02:26,125
Please step aside, Madame.

11
00:02:27,791 --> 00:02:28,708
No I won't.

12
00:02:28,791 --> 00:02:31,000
I'm begging you!

13
00:02:39,625 --> 00:02:41,125
Huh!

14
00:02:41,208 --> 00:02:44,000
What's the matter? Madame?

15
00:02:44,083 --> 00:02:44,750
Mama!

16
00:02:44,833 --> 00:02:46,916
Mama, what's wrong?

17
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,375
What's the matter with me...?

18
00:02:49,458 --> 00:02:52,833
I don't understand--

19
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,333
Renaud! Go get the car!

20
00:02:58,416 --> 00:02:59,666
Huh? Right!

21
00:03:03,916 --> 00:03:05,500
Heloise?

22
00:03:05,583 --> 00:03:07,041
 Heloise!

23
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,583
You! Get after those three!

24
00:03:14,666 --> 00:03:16,250
They took my daughter!

25
00:03:18,291 --> 00:03:19,750
I can't believe
he's shooting at us!

26
00:03:19,833 --> 00:03:21,625
Faster!

27
00:03:25,375 --> 00:03:26,666
All right, watch this!

28
00:03:31,916 --> 00:03:34,333
Renaud?

29
00:03:35,125 --> 00:03:36,458
Albert! Block the road!

30
00:03:36,541 --> 00:03:37,583
Huh!

31
00:03:42,708 --> 00:03:44,250
Ahhhh!!

32
00:04:16,958 --> 00:04:19,333
Okay, that should do it.

33
00:04:19,416 --> 00:04:20,833
Ow! Why'd you do that?!

34
00:04:20,916 --> 00:04:22,208
You're really lucky.

35
00:04:22,291 --> 00:04:24,625
It could have been
something serious.

36
00:04:24,708 --> 00:04:27,708
Oh, I wish you
wouldn't worry me so...

37
00:04:27,791 --> 00:04:29,666
Aw, come on! Quit it!

38
00:04:30,666 --> 00:04:33,250
I do hope you realize that
what you guys did is usually

39
00:04:33,333 --> 00:04:36,166
referred to as "kidnapping"
and is very illegal!

40
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:38,166
Like you're one to talk!

41
00:04:41,583 --> 00:04:43,250
Once people know
why we did it,

42
00:04:43,333 --> 00:04:46,250
I'm pretty sure
they'll understand.

43
00:04:46,333 --> 00:04:49,208
But it's gonna be
Monsieur Villefort

44
00:04:49,291 --> 00:04:51,041
who tries the case.

45
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:52,875
...won't it?

46
00:04:52,958 --> 00:04:54,583
Yeah.

47
00:05:17,583 --> 00:05:20,625
The dead man has once
again come back to us!

48
00:05:20,708 --> 00:05:23,541
Edmond would never
forget what we did to him.

49
00:05:23,625 --> 00:05:26,291
Even from beyond the grave.

50
00:05:29,083 --> 00:05:30,750
Can't you sleep?

51
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:37,541
No. It's just that today
was a terrible day.

52
00:05:41,666 --> 00:05:44,375
By the way, where did
you go this morning?

53
00:05:44,458 --> 00:05:48,500
I went to a funeral.

54
00:05:48,583 --> 00:05:50,291
Don't lie to me.

55
00:05:51,333 --> 00:05:54,083
A letter from Edmond
came this morning, right?

56
00:05:57,083 --> 00:05:58,333
How did you know that?

57
00:05:58,416 --> 00:06:01,000
I want you to tell me
what this is all about.

58
00:06:01,083 --> 00:06:02,833
It was just a tasteless prank.

59
00:06:02,916 --> 00:06:05,083
But why would anyone
use that name for a prank?

60
00:06:05,166 --> 00:06:06,083
It makes no sense!

61
00:06:06,166 --> 00:06:07,666
I really have no idea!

62
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:09,375
Now, Edmond was
accused of treason

63
00:06:09,458 --> 00:06:12,166
and died in the far
reaches of space, didn't he?

64
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:13,791
Isn't that what happened?

65
00:06:13,875 --> 00:06:14,833
Answer me!

66
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:17,083
If you know
anything else, tell me.

67
00:06:18,375 --> 00:06:20,916
Please, Fernand, tell me.

68
00:06:21,708 --> 00:06:24,291
He's dead and long gone.

69
00:06:24,375 --> 00:06:27,375
You're hiding something from me.
I can see it in your eyes!

70
00:06:27,458 --> 00:06:29,458
I'm telling you
the man is dead!

71
00:06:29,541 --> 00:06:31,875
I'm not hiding
anything from you.

72
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:34,875
He died in a
prison long time ago!

73
00:06:34,958 --> 00:06:38,125
You still can't forget what
happened 20 years ago, can you?!

74
00:06:38,208 --> 00:06:39,125
Can you?!

75
00:06:39,208 --> 00:06:41,250
I demand you
answer me right now!

76
00:06:41,333 --> 00:06:42,416
Have you been
thinking about

77
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:45,375
that man every day
of the past 20 years?!

78
00:06:45,458 --> 00:06:46,333
Tell me!!

79
00:06:46,416 --> 00:06:47,916
Are you still in
love with him?!

80
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,125
In love with a ghost?!!

81
00:06:50,208 --> 00:06:54,875
It was only because I was
told that he was dead that I...

82
00:07:01,416 --> 00:07:03,708
You only did what...

83
00:07:03,791 --> 00:07:05,666
You were told he was dead,

84
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:09,416
so you gave up on him
and married me instead?

85
00:07:09,875 --> 00:07:12,083
Is that it?!

86
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:15,125
Stop it.

87
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:33,125
Mercedes...

88
00:07:36,375 --> 00:07:37,833
Mercedes...

89
00:07:42,708 --> 00:07:45,750
MERCEDES!

90
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:47,791
The crime lab has determined

91
00:07:47,875 --> 00:07:49,916
that the cause
was a strong poison.

92
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,958
It's some sort
of botanical toxin.

93
00:07:52,041 --> 00:07:53,833
We're trying to identify it.

94
00:07:53,916 --> 00:07:55,333
I see.

95
00:07:55,416 --> 00:07:58,291
Your Honor, I suggest that
you exercise extreme caution.

96
00:07:58,375 --> 00:08:00,958
The culprit might
still be in the house.

97
00:08:01,041 --> 00:08:03,458
I've already dismissed
all the servants.

98
00:08:03,541 --> 00:08:05,166
You don't need
to worry about me.

99
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:07,000
But sir-- I really think...

100
00:08:07,083 --> 00:08:09,333
There are two things
that you must do now.

101
00:08:09,416 --> 00:08:12,625
The first is to prevent any
news of this from leaking.

102
00:08:12,708 --> 00:08:14,625
The second is my daughter.

103
00:08:14,708 --> 00:08:17,208
Find out where she's
been taken without delay!

104
00:08:17,291 --> 00:08:19,208
The search team arrived
in Marseilles this morning

105
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:20,500
and has begun their work.

106
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:23,375
They'll find her
before today is finished.

107
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:26,708
Notify me when they do.

108
00:08:26,791 --> 00:08:27,750
We have an arrest warrant

109
00:08:27,833 --> 00:08:29,333
for the perpetrators
is standing by.

110
00:08:29,416 --> 00:08:32,500
No, just pinpoint
where they are for now.

111
00:08:32,583 --> 00:08:35,208
Leave them alone
for the time being.

112
00:08:35,291 --> 00:08:36,541
Yes, sir.

113
00:09:09,791 --> 00:09:11,250
Franz?

114
00:09:14,708 --> 00:09:17,666
Albert, what's wrong?

115
00:09:20,166 --> 00:09:22,625
I really wasn't
expecting you to be here.

116
00:09:26,416 --> 00:09:27,625
So Albert, is there some reason

117
00:09:27,708 --> 00:09:29,291
why you don't
want to go home?

118
00:09:29,375 --> 00:09:30,791
Not really.

119
00:09:32,208 --> 00:09:34,041
Want to read this letter?

120
00:09:34,916 --> 00:09:36,416
Who's it from?

121
00:09:37,958 --> 00:09:39,791
Maximilien?

122
00:09:41,083 --> 00:09:42,458
He sure has
neat handwriting.

123
00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:44,166
Yeah, as opposed
to you.

124
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,208
You're pushing it,
all right?

125
00:09:48,375 --> 00:09:51,166
So I guess he made
it to Marseilles safely.

126
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:53,000
Yeah, and I'll bet
he's totally freaking out

127
00:09:53,083 --> 00:09:55,208
over what he's
done right about now.

128
00:09:55,291 --> 00:09:57,208
That's very possible.

129
00:09:57,708 --> 00:10:01,291
[FRANZ and ALBERT laughing]

130
00:10:01,375 --> 00:10:02,375
Hey...

131
00:10:02,458 --> 00:10:03,416
Hm?

132
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:05,541
What kind of person
is Madame Heloise?

133
00:10:05,625 --> 00:10:08,416
What's Valentine's
step-mother really like?

134
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:13,166
Well, She's a beautiful,
young, intelligent woman.

135
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:16,125
Yeah, she is, huh?

136
00:10:16,208 --> 00:10:19,250
That's what I was
thinking, too.

137
00:10:19,958 --> 00:10:22,458
Albert, can I ask
you something?

138
00:10:22,541 --> 00:10:24,125
Yeah, go ahead.

139
00:10:24,208 --> 00:10:26,541
You said that you
saw Madame Villefort

140
00:10:26,625 --> 00:10:29,208
and the Count in the
greenhouse together...

141
00:10:29,291 --> 00:10:30,458
What about it?

142
00:10:30,541 --> 00:10:32,125
Ever since you told
me about it at Auteuil,

143
00:10:32,208 --> 00:10:33,500
it's been nagging at me.

144
00:10:33,583 --> 00:10:34,666
It means that--

145
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:35,625
Means what?

146
00:10:35,708 --> 00:10:36,541
What're you getting at?

147
00:10:36,625 --> 00:10:37,750
Well, why did
the Count happen

148
00:10:37,833 --> 00:10:39,916
to pick her to
have an affair with?

149
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,250
I'm starting to think he
targeted her specifically

150
00:10:42,333 --> 00:10:44,000
and made his move on her.

151
00:10:44,083 --> 00:10:46,000
And how is it that he took
one look at your symptoms

152
00:10:46,083 --> 00:10:47,833
and knew right
away it was poison?

153
00:10:47,916 --> 00:10:48,541
Hey wait!

154
00:10:48,625 --> 00:10:49,791
Are you trying to imply

155
00:10:49,875 --> 00:10:51,625
that the Count is the
one behind all this?!

156
00:10:51,708 --> 00:10:52,791
I don't believe that!

157
00:10:52,875 --> 00:10:54,708
I don't believe
that for a minute!

158
00:10:54,791 --> 00:10:58,875
Because of him, I'm alive
and standing here right now!

159
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:00,375
Just listen to me, Albert.

160
00:11:00,458 --> 00:11:02,125
Even if you looked
all over Paris,

161
00:11:02,208 --> 00:11:04,583
you wouldn't find very many
people who would conveniently

162
00:11:04,666 --> 00:11:06,791
have antitoxins on them.

163
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:08,041
Not even doctors!

164
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:10,833
So? Were you able
to save my life, Franz?

165
00:11:10,916 --> 00:11:13,125
You couldn't help, am I right?!

166
00:11:13,208 --> 00:11:14,500
The only reason
I survived that night was

167
00:11:14,583 --> 00:11:17,958
because the Count was there!

168
00:11:18,041 --> 00:11:19,541
What could the Count
possibly hope to gain

169
00:11:19,625 --> 00:11:21,291
by trying to poison everybody?

170
00:11:21,375 --> 00:11:22,666
Tell me!

171
00:11:24,125 --> 00:11:25,458
I don't know.

172
00:11:25,541 --> 00:11:26,875
But I can sense it...

173
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:29,000
Can sense what?

174
00:11:29,083 --> 00:11:32,750
A deep darkness...

175
00:11:37,333 --> 00:11:38,958
Sorry to bother you.

176
00:11:41,708 --> 00:11:44,000
Albert, wait! Please!

177
00:11:44,083 --> 00:11:45,958
Take a good look
at the real Count!

178
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:50,541
Franz.

179
00:11:50,625 --> 00:11:54,000
Whatever you say,
I have faith in him.

180
00:11:54,083 --> 00:11:57,333
There's only one person
who knows the real Count...

181
00:11:57,416 --> 00:11:59,333
That person's me!

182
00:12:41,125 --> 00:12:42,625
So, there you are.

183
00:12:42,708 --> 00:12:44,041
You've come around...

184
00:12:44,125 --> 00:12:45,333
What happened?

185
00:12:45,416 --> 00:12:47,500
I can't remember anything.

186
00:12:47,583 --> 00:12:49,208
My memory's a jumble...

187
00:12:49,291 --> 00:12:51,041
Really...

188
00:12:56,125 --> 00:12:57,250
My head.

189
00:12:57,333 --> 00:13:00,000
I can't seem to
shake off this feeling...

190
00:13:00,083 --> 00:13:02,958
That's because of the
poison, don't you think?

191
00:13:04,041 --> 00:13:05,708
Poison?

192
00:13:06,541 --> 00:13:07,250
Yes.

193
00:13:07,333 --> 00:13:08,458
There's a fair amount

194
00:13:08,541 --> 00:13:11,458
of poison coursing through
your body right now.

195
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:14,416
Tell me.

196
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,666
When did you get that
ring from the Count?

197
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:18,041
What do you mean?

198
00:13:18,125 --> 00:13:20,416
I hope that you're not
trying to imply anything...

199
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:21,375
Not at all.

200
00:13:21,458 --> 00:13:23,916
I'll rephrase my question.

201
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:29,125
Have you ever
seen this before?

202
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:32,291
I I have no idea
what that is.

203
00:13:32,375 --> 00:13:34,500
I found it in
your jewelry box.

204
00:13:34,583 --> 00:13:37,083
Perhaps it's merely
a perfume bottle...

205
00:13:37,166 --> 00:13:38,083
I don't know.

206
00:13:38,166 --> 00:13:41,208
That bottle isn't mine!

207
00:13:41,833 --> 00:13:42,875
Stupid fool!

208
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:43,833
What's wrong with you?

209
00:13:43,916 --> 00:13:45,958
Are you trying to ruin me?

210
00:13:46,041 --> 00:13:47,416
You realize that
what you've done

211
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:49,958
will never be able
to be made right.

212
00:13:50,041 --> 00:13:52,875
If it were ever to get out
that my wife is a murderer,

213
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:54,208
what do you think
would happen to me

214
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:57,208
and everything that
I've built throughout my life?!

215
00:13:58,875 --> 00:14:02,125
Your plans haven't run
their course yet, have they?

216
00:14:04,541 --> 00:14:07,916
Who else did you poison?
Valentine?

217
00:14:08,958 --> 00:14:09,958
Answer me!

218
00:14:10,041 --> 00:14:12,166
How many more
do you plan to kill?!

219
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:14,333
Is my name on your list?

220
00:14:14,416 --> 00:14:16,958
Were you planning
to kill me too?

221
00:14:18,208 --> 00:14:19,375
Yes that's right!

222
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:22,375
I had intended
to kill you, too!

223
00:14:22,458 --> 00:14:27,250
I only need my sweet darling
son Edouard to be happy!

224
00:14:30,083 --> 00:14:32,500
Look at you, acting
so high and mighty!

225
00:14:32,583 --> 00:14:34,875
I won't stand for
all these insults!

226
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:36,625
You know what,
I dare you to speak to me

227
00:14:36,708 --> 00:14:38,958
with that tone
in your voice again!

228
00:14:39,041 --> 00:14:41,208
I'll kill myself right here!

229
00:14:41,291 --> 00:14:43,333
To the mighty Prosecutor
who values appearances

230
00:14:43,416 --> 00:14:47,291
more than anything there
could be no greater scandal!

231
00:15:00,708 --> 00:15:04,208
You don't mean
to suggest I--

232
00:15:06,291 --> 00:15:07,541
What's the matter?

233
00:15:07,625 --> 00:15:10,000
Aren't you going
to drink it?

234
00:15:10,083 --> 00:15:12,333
What kind of
man are you?

235
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:20,375
Are you only capable
of killing other people?

236
00:15:24,375 --> 00:15:27,791
Tomorrow morning, you
will be taken to a hospital.

237
00:15:27,875 --> 00:15:31,208
I've had a private room with
barred windows prepared for you.

238
00:15:31,291 --> 00:15:33,125
The quarters won't
be very spacious,

239
00:15:33,208 --> 00:15:35,458
but you will spend the
rest of your days there.

240
00:15:35,541 --> 00:15:38,333
Along with your poisons.

241
00:15:42,291 --> 00:15:45,250
[HELOISE crying]

242
00:16:10,166 --> 00:16:11,750
Albert, wait! Please!

243
00:16:11,833 --> 00:16:14,500
Take a good look
at the real Count!

244
00:16:15,166 --> 00:16:17,833
I know the real Count better
than anyone else on Earth.

245
00:16:17,916 --> 00:16:19,083
I know it!

246
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:21,875
Excellency!

247
00:16:21,958 --> 00:16:23,500
Greetings, Monsieur Albert.

248
00:16:23,583 --> 00:16:25,791
Are you feeling well today?

249
00:16:25,875 --> 00:16:26,916
I am, thank you.

250
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,958
You seem in rather high spirits.

251
00:16:35,666 --> 00:16:39,333
So, I take it that Mademoiselle
Valentine was saved?

252
00:16:39,416 --> 00:16:40,416
Yes.

253
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:41,875
She's recuperating
in Marseilles now

254
00:16:41,958 --> 00:16:44,583
with Maximilien
watching over her.

255
00:16:44,666 --> 00:16:47,083
That is wonderful news.

256
00:16:48,041 --> 00:16:51,791
Yes but we got there
too late to save Valois,

257
00:16:51,875 --> 00:16:53,958
he died before we arrived.

258
00:16:54,041 --> 00:16:55,916
Don't forget that you
were able to save the life

259
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,041
of your dear friend Valentine.

260
00:16:58,125 --> 00:17:00,291
You've nothing
to feel sad about.

261
00:17:00,375 --> 00:17:03,708
Madame Villefort has
had a mental breakdown...

262
00:17:03,791 --> 00:17:05,708
Count, why do you think
those horrible things happened

263
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:07,416
to the Villefort family?

264
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,583
It seems terribly unfair.

265
00:17:12,166 --> 00:17:13,833
It was inevitable.

266
00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:18,125
There are no coincidences
in the real world.

267
00:17:18,208 --> 00:17:20,916
It all comes down to karma.

268
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,333
What do you mean
by that, your Excellency?

269
00:17:23,416 --> 00:17:25,000
Are you saying that
the Villeforts deserved

270
00:17:25,083 --> 00:17:27,416
what happened to them?

271
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:30,416
You recall that day on
Luna when you and I met?

272
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:35,208
Perhaps you feel that our
meeting was a chance encounter.

273
00:17:36,208 --> 00:17:40,083
But in fate, there
are no coincidences.

274
00:17:40,166 --> 00:17:43,458
Just as that setting
sun does so according

275
00:17:43,541 --> 00:17:46,916
to the laws of the universe,
fate, too, is composed of the

276
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:51,083
powerful natural forces
of unyielding necessity.

277
00:17:51,166 --> 00:17:52,250
There's no such thing

278
00:17:52,333 --> 00:17:54,333
as coincidence in
your life, Excellency?

279
00:17:54,416 --> 00:17:56,750
No. There is not.

280
00:17:56,833 --> 00:18:00,833
What I have is the
power of strong will.

281
00:18:00,916 --> 00:18:03,750
Even if other people accept
coincidences in their lives

282
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:07,041
and are tossed about
by them, I do not.

283
00:18:07,125 --> 00:18:10,666
For you see, I have
forged my own destiny

284
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:12,791
through the power
of my own will.

285
00:18:12,875 --> 00:18:17,500
Forged your destiny through
the power of your will...

286
00:18:17,583 --> 00:18:19,875
That is why you and
I were brought together,

287
00:18:19,958 --> 00:18:23,375
and why you and I sit here now.

288
00:18:23,458 --> 00:18:26,666
Excellency, I want
to change my life.

289
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:29,833
To be a strong
man just like you.

290
00:18:29,916 --> 00:18:31,333
In that case, please allow me

291
00:18:31,416 --> 00:18:34,291
to offer you these
simple words of advice.

292
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,500
You must bide your time.

293
00:18:44,583 --> 00:18:46,000
And hold out hope.

294
00:18:47,791 --> 00:18:51,791
You must bide your time...

295
00:18:51,875 --> 00:18:53,833
And hold out hope.

296
00:18:58,958 --> 00:19:00,833
Albert!

297
00:19:00,916 --> 00:19:03,458
Why do you have that idiotic
expression on your face?

298
00:19:03,541 --> 00:19:04,833
Eugenie?

299
00:19:04,916 --> 00:19:06,083
How's your mother doing?

300
00:19:06,166 --> 00:19:07,625
It's nothing serious.

301
00:19:07,708 --> 00:19:10,333
But she's been in a
bad mood ever since.

302
00:19:10,416 --> 00:19:11,333
Oh.

303
00:19:11,416 --> 00:19:13,166
Enough about that,
listen to this!

304
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:15,416
I've been invited
to play the piano

305
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,791
at the concert hall
with the orchestra!

306
00:19:17,875 --> 00:19:19,125
At the opera house?

307
00:19:19,208 --> 00:19:21,666
That's right! My dream
is finally coming true.

308
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:23,541
I just got the good news!

309
00:19:24,666 --> 00:19:27,833
They've recognized
I have talent on the piano!

310
00:19:30,666 --> 00:19:32,833
Hey that's great!

311
00:19:34,875 --> 00:19:36,625
Come and hear me play, okay?

312
00:19:36,708 --> 00:19:38,041
You bet.

313
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:40,833
That's so amazing!

314
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,458
Well, I should get back
and practice some more.

315
00:19:44,541 --> 00:19:46,375
Uh, Eugenie?

316
00:19:46,458 --> 00:19:47,833
Hm?

317
00:19:47,916 --> 00:19:50,916
When you played for
us that night at Auteuil...

318
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,375
It was really...

319
00:19:52,458 --> 00:19:54,833
Well, It was wonderful.

320
00:19:54,916 --> 00:19:58,125
So you were paying attention?

321
00:20:00,333 --> 00:20:03,875
I'm happy. Thanks a lot Albert.

322
00:20:03,958 --> 00:20:05,500
Bye...

323
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:37,000
Flowers have arrived
for you, Mademoiselle.

324
00:20:57,041 --> 00:21:00,125
Andrea Cavalcanti?

325
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:11,791
Hm!

326
00:21:19,041 --> 00:21:21,083
Hello! I'm home!

327
00:21:25,833 --> 00:21:27,625
What's the matter?

328
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,375
Take a look at this.

Danglars says that he has
decided it would be best

330
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:41,791
to break off your
engagement to Eugenie.

331
00:21:48,625 --> 00:21:50,208
But why?

332
00:23:28,833 --> 00:23:30,416
[ALBERT] I have to
know how she really feels.

333
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:32,541
So I run to the opera house.

334
00:23:32,625 --> 00:23:35,125
I have to know
how I really feel.

335
00:23:35,208 --> 00:23:37,500
Next Gankutsuou,
The Count of Monte Cristo

336
00:23:37,583 --> 00:23:39,333
Act 12: "Encore."

337
00:23:39,416 --> 00:23:41,791
Bide your time,
and hold out hope!
