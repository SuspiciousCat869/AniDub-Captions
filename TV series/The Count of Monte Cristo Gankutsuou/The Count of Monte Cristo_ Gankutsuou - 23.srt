Albert!

3
00:00:23,125 --> 00:00:24,583
This isn't over yet!

4
00:00:24,666 --> 00:00:26,625
Eat this!

5
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:34,791
Hey, Albert!

6
00:00:43,791 --> 00:00:46,000
Father... why...

7
00:01:25,416 --> 00:01:27,625
[MONTE CRISTO]
I bid you welcome!

8
00:01:29,916 --> 00:01:33,541
You die!

[MONTE CRISTO cackling]

13
00:01:58,291 --> 00:01:59,250
[FERNAND]
Where'd you go?!

14
00:01:59,333 --> 00:02:02,583
Where are you?! Show yourself!

15
00:02:06,125 --> 00:02:07,000

[MONTE CRISTO]
Fernand Mondego!

17
00:02:11,291 --> 00:02:13,208
Please allow me
to express my gratitude

18
00:02:13,291 --> 00:02:16,000
for attacking in person,
my good General.

19
00:02:16,083 --> 00:02:18,000
You vile specter!

20
00:02:18,083 --> 00:02:21,333
[FERNAND] Those words will be
the last ones you ever speak.

[FERNAND grunts]

22
00:02:27,291 --> 00:02:29,291
[MONTE CRISTO] I will curse
you with the despair of one

23
00:02:29,375 --> 00:02:32,666
who has had everything
in life stolen from him.

24
00:02:35,375 --> 00:02:39,041
[MONTE CRISTO]
Prepare to feel the burning fire

25
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:40,625
of my vengeance!

Don't push yourself.

[ALBERT]
Where's Mother?!

29
00:02:54,291 --> 00:02:56,291
We managed to pull
her back from the brink.

30
00:02:56,375 --> 00:02:59,000
We're keeping her
doped up for now.

31
00:03:04,333 --> 00:03:06,291
[ALBERT] Baptistin!
Can this ship still fly?!

32
00:03:06,375 --> 00:03:07,541
Yeah, just barely.

33
00:03:07,625 --> 00:03:09,583
We gotta hurry and get
to the Champs Elysees!

34
00:03:09,666 --> 00:03:11,666
My father's gonna try
and murder the Count!

35
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:13,541
[BERTUCCIO]
Lifting off immediately.

36
00:03:13,625 --> 00:03:15,625
Setting course for
the Count's manor!

37
00:03:15,708 --> 00:03:18,083
Baptistin, you've got things
covered down there, right?

38
00:03:18,166 --> 00:03:21,000
You bet! Go ahead
and do your thing!

[HAIDEE]
Excellency!

42
00:03:47,833 --> 00:03:49,958
Hurry! Please, you
must take your medicine!

43
00:03:51,541 --> 00:03:54,208
Not necessary, Haidee.

44
00:03:57,583 --> 00:04:01,000
[MONTE CRISTO] My pact with
Gankutsuou is inviolate.

45
00:04:01,083 --> 00:04:01,958
From now on.

46
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:04,666
My body is no longer my own.

47
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:08,166
No, Excellency!
You are yourself! I know it!

48
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:11,250
You are the only person
in this world I adore.

49
00:04:11,333 --> 00:04:13,833
Please stop this for my sake!

50
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,791
[MONTE CRISTO] Haidee, your
words no longer reach me.

51
00:04:25,875 --> 00:04:32,083
My only desire is to
carry out my final revenge.

No, I will not allow you to die.

54
00:04:55,291 --> 00:04:58,708
Not like my father did...
I won't do it.

[MONTE CRISTO]
I will not kill you.

How can this be?!

I will not... die.

00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:09,416
[MONTE CRISTO]
I am not even permitted

81
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,791
the final peace of death.

82
00:07:11,875 --> 00:07:14,291
Stay away! Stay away!

[MONTE CRISTO]
Fernand. Look upon me.

84
00:07:17,083 --> 00:07:20,916
Look upon the twisted man
who has sacrificed himself,

00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,625
body and soul, for the
sake of his ultimate revenge!

[HAIDEE]
You mustn't!

00:07:35,541 --> 00:07:38,666
You mustn't go any
further with this, Count!

[HAIDEE]
I cannot...

90
00:07:42,625 --> 00:07:45,208
I cannot allow you to
continue with your revenge.

91
00:07:45,291 --> 00:07:46,916
Stand aside, girl.

[HAIDEE]
I will not!

95
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:55,291
[HAIDEE]
Because... I...

96
00:07:56,333 --> 00:07:58,875
Because I love you, Count!

97
00:08:00,041 --> 00:08:02,666
I just... can't lose you.

98

I don't want to lose
another person I love.

[FERNAND] You heard what the
little girl said, Edmond.

103
00:08:14,708 --> 00:08:16,041
Her Highness says
that she's willing

104
00:08:16,125 --> 00:08:19,458
to sacrifice her life
for your pitiful salvation.

Father, stop it! Don't do it!

00:08:34,041 --> 00:08:36,833
Drop it! Put that
sword down right now!

111
00:08:36,916 --> 00:08:39,541
If you don't, she dies!

[FERNAND]
You and your stupid "revenge"!

116
00:08:51,541 --> 00:08:52,708
You and your "judgment"!

117
00:08:52,791 --> 00:08:54,125
You and your rage!

118
00:08:54,208 --> 00:08:55,875
This is why you've
always been nothing more

119
00:08:55,958 --> 00:08:58,541
than a pathetic
hopeless weakling!

120
00:08:59,166 --> 00:09:00,750
So then I guess, you got just

121
00:09:00,833 --> 00:09:03,666
a little too carried
away don't you think?

122
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:05,416
Shall I have you
pay the price for

123
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:08,375
that unfortunate
indiscretion right here?

[MONTE CRISTO]
Fernand.

126
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:22,791
I suggest you look to your son.

127
00:09:27,916 --> 00:09:29,041
You bastard!

128
00:09:29,125 --> 00:09:31,166
You may be right, but...

129
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:34,458
Your son's life is
mine for the taking.

[MONTE CRISTO]
Bertuccio.

131
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:44,875
Pull the trigger.

132
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:47,291
What is this?
Have you gone insane?!

133
00:09:47,375 --> 00:09:49,750
Go ahead, I dare you to shoot!

134
00:09:49,833 --> 00:09:52,250
She'll follow right
on his heels if you do!

135
00:09:52,333 --> 00:09:54,333
Stop it! Don't do it, Father!

136
00:09:54,416 --> 00:09:57,041
[FERNAND]
Come on, Edmond! Give it up!

137
00:09:57,125 --> 00:09:58,958
Don't stand there and
pretend to be so tough,

138
00:09:59,041 --> 00:10:00,208
'cause you're not!

139
00:10:00,291 --> 00:10:01,916
Let my son go now!

140
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,166
Bertuccio, please,
you don't have to do this!

141
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:05,416
He'll kill her!

142

Don't you care what
happens to Haidee?!

The man I serve is...

144
00:10:08,791 --> 00:10:11,958
The man I serve
has ordered me to...

145
00:10:15,791 --> 00:10:18,791
[ALBERT] Father...
Don't hurt anyone but me.

146

Please, Father,
don't hurt her any more,

147
00:10:22,708 --> 00:10:24,583
haven't you done enough?

Edmond!

150
00:11:04,625 --> 00:11:08,000
[FERNAND] Please, Edmond let
my son go - don't hurt him.

151
00:11:08,083 --> 00:11:09,833
He's the only thing
in this entire world

152
00:11:09,916 --> 00:11:11,916
that I have left
that's precious to me.

153

Don't take him from me!

Hate me! Hate me!

155
00:11:16,291 --> 00:11:18,458
I'll give you my life
if that's what you want!

156
00:11:18,541 --> 00:11:22,125
But please,
please don't take his.

157
00:11:22,208 --> 00:11:24,166
I'm begging you, Edmond!

158
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:27,708
Anything but my son's life!

159
00:11:32,333 --> 00:11:34,666
[FERNAND]
Kill me! Kill me!

160
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,041
Fernand...

161
00:11:40,375 --> 00:11:42,083
[MONTE CRISTO]
I'm so sorry.

162
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:47,666
Death is the ultimate end
of all things on this plane.

163

Excellency, what
is it that you want

177
00:12:59,791 --> 00:13:03,916
so badly that you're willing to
hurt innocent people to get it?!

And you, Father, what
the hell is so important

179
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:11,375
that you'd kill Mother
and Haidee for it?!

180
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:12,833
What could be more
important to you two

181
00:13:12,916 --> 00:13:14,791
than the lives
of innocent people!

182
00:13:14,875 --> 00:13:19,458
No matter how you try to justify
it, murder is still murder!

183
00:13:19,541 --> 00:13:24,083
Count, Father, all you two
are doing is running away!

184
00:13:24,166 --> 00:13:26,541
All you're doing is
deluding yourselves

185
00:13:26,625 --> 00:13:29,916

down somehow makes you better!

You think that you

that you spoke so
eloquently about?!

198

Weren't you the one who
insisted that a person's destiny

199
00:14:03,708 --> 00:14:05,541
was something that he
had to create for himself

200

with his own two hands?!

201
00:14:07,333 --> 00:14:10,458
So tell me, where's that
precious will of yours now, huh?

I might not be able

that the Count wants you to stay
here and die in this place?!

said to us before he died?

always aspired to two things.

To be nobler than
the greatest of nobility.

To be a finer soldier than
any that has ever lived before.

But in the end, it was
all an egotistical wish

that glossed over
what laid underneath.
