1
00:01:49,875 --> 00:01:52,958
[FARIA] Madams and Messieurs,
good evening...

2
00:01:53,041 --> 00:01:56,375
On that stormy day that
announced the end of spring,

3
00:01:56,458 --> 00:01:58,666
my friend and
I arrived in Paris,

4
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:00,791
where the boy awaited us.

5
00:02:00,875 --> 00:02:02,291
I tremble in silence

6
00:02:02,375 --> 00:02:05,875
at these long buried
emotions that seep out...

7
00:02:05,958 --> 00:02:10,375
...as the hour of
reunion draws near.

8
00:02:13,375 --> 00:02:16,416
[ALBERT'S MOM] Oh!
This must be your visitor.

9
00:02:32,041 --> 00:02:33,541
Your Excellency,
if you don't mind,

10
00:02:33,625 --> 00:02:35,125
I'd really like you
to join us for dinner

11
00:02:35,208 --> 00:02:38,041
after you've had a chance
to meet my parents.

12
00:02:45,375 --> 00:02:47,125
Will you?

13
00:02:50,291 --> 00:02:52,958
[MONTE CRISTO] If it
is not too much trouble.

14
00:02:53,041 --> 00:02:55,791
No! After all,
you are responsible

15
00:02:55,875 --> 00:02:58,208
for saving our son's life.

16
00:02:58,291 --> 00:03:01,958
You are welcome in our home,
your Excellency.

17
00:03:15,416 --> 00:03:17,875
[ALBERT'S DAD] Good fortune
and long life to our new friend,

18
00:03:17,958 --> 00:03:20,416
the Count of Monte Cristo.

19
00:03:24,583 --> 00:03:26,041
I must say, sir...

20
00:03:26,125 --> 00:03:27,291
I'm embarrassed that you know

21
00:03:27,375 --> 00:03:30,750
of the Janina campaign.
It's been a long time.

22
00:03:30,833 --> 00:03:33,416
It's true many people
praise me as a hero

23
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:37,083
but to a soldier,
such things mean very little.

24
00:03:37,166 --> 00:03:40,083
After all, nothing good
ever results from destruction.

25
00:03:40,166 --> 00:03:43,000
[MONTE CRISTO] No, these
idyllic times in which we live

26
00:03:43,083 --> 00:03:44,625
were built on sacrifice.

27
00:03:44,708 --> 00:03:46,375
At any rate that's my opinion.

28
00:03:46,458 --> 00:03:48,416
I expect that the far
corners of the galaxy

29
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:51,625
are echoing with the name
of General Morcerf by now.

30
00:03:51,708 --> 00:03:54,333
You honor me by saying so.

31
00:04:08,666 --> 00:04:09,916
Oh, dear,

32
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,375
wasn't the food to your
liking your Excellency?

33
00:04:13,458 --> 00:04:14,958
Not at all.

34
00:04:15,041 --> 00:04:17,333
Please, Madame
think nothing of it.

35
00:04:17,416 --> 00:04:18,875
Over the years
I seem to have fallen

36
00:04:18,958 --> 00:04:21,541
into the habit of
eating very little.

37
00:04:22,541 --> 00:04:25,250
I understand exactly
how you feel, sir.

38
00:04:25,333 --> 00:04:26,833
As I advance in my years,

39
00:04:26,916 --> 00:04:28,708
I find myself more
and more weary

40
00:04:28,791 --> 00:04:31,458
of extravagant meals
such as this one.

41
00:04:31,541 --> 00:04:35,125
It also seems that lately
I seldom sleep, anymore.

42
00:04:36,125 --> 00:04:39,125
I'm amazed that you've
managed to stay healthy.

43
00:04:39,791 --> 00:04:41,666
It is because of these.

44
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:44,250
Some sort of space rations?

45
00:04:44,333 --> 00:04:47,916
In the course of wandering
the sea of stars for so long,

46
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,458
my body and soul have
changed beyond recognition.

47
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:53,541
Even so, I hope that
you will at least

48
00:04:53,625 --> 00:04:56,208
try to eat something
this evening...

49
00:04:56,291 --> 00:04:59,583
The thought of neither sleeping
nor eating is too sad to bear.

50
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:01,125
Perhaps it is.

51
00:05:01,208 --> 00:05:02,791
Very well, then...

52
00:05:05,166 --> 00:05:08,541
I shall sample this
dish for you Madame.

53
00:05:08,625 --> 00:05:10,333
Thank you...

54
00:05:23,708 --> 00:05:25,750
[MONTE CRISTO] This taste
brings back memories...

55
00:05:25,833 --> 00:05:27,083
 Memories, sir?

56
00:05:27,166 --> 00:05:29,500
I once experienced
delightful cooking

57
00:05:29,583 --> 00:05:32,583
such as this in
the south of France.

58
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:34,625
You've been making this dish

59
00:05:34,708 --> 00:05:36,458
for about as long as I can
remember, right, Mother?

60
00:05:36,541 --> 00:05:38,416
Uh... Yes...

61
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:39,875
By any chance, Madame,

62
00:05:39,958 --> 00:05:42,000
you wouldn't happen to be
from Marseilles, would you?

63
00:05:42,083 --> 00:05:42,875
No, sir...

64
00:05:42,958 --> 00:05:43,958
My wife has no connection

65
00:05:44,041 --> 00:05:46,625
to such a vile and
barbaric province.

66
00:05:46,708 --> 00:05:48,750
Isn't that right,
Mercedes, dear?

67
00:05:48,833 --> 00:05:51,541
Uh, yes...

68
00:05:51,625 --> 00:05:52,916
Barbaric, huh...

69
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
What's the matter?

70
00:05:55,083 --> 00:05:58,000
It's just that one of
my friends is from Marseilles.

71
00:05:58,083 --> 00:05:59,875
His name is Maximilien Morrel.

72
00:05:59,958 --> 00:06:01,750
He's a really nice person.

73
00:06:01,833 --> 00:06:03,583
Morrel...

74
00:06:03,666 --> 00:06:06,833
Forgive me my rude inquiry.

75
00:06:06,916 --> 00:06:10,208
I certainly did
not mean to offend.

76
00:06:10,291 --> 00:06:11,916
Of course...

77
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,791
Our family traces
its roots back to an old

78
00:06:13,875 --> 00:06:17,625
and powerful Catalan family and
this soup has been a specialty

79
00:06:17,708 --> 00:06:20,458
of my wife's ever since
she was a young girl.

80
00:06:20,541 --> 00:06:21,875
Oh, I see.

81
00:06:21,958 --> 00:06:24,375
So, you and the Countess
were childhood friends, then?

82
00:06:24,458 --> 00:06:25,750
Yes, we were.

83
00:06:25,833 --> 00:06:28,083
Which explains
why you seem so close.

84
00:06:28,166 --> 00:06:30,750
I am jealous beyond words.

85
00:06:30,833 --> 00:06:33,083
I had no idea that it was
possible for a man like you

86
00:06:33,166 --> 00:06:35,375
to be jealous of anyone,
Your Excellency.

87
00:06:35,458 --> 00:06:37,000
Yes, of course it is.

88
00:06:37,083 --> 00:06:40,416
When faced with a man
of your father's caliber.

89
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,666
Bring his Excellency
something more to drink.

90
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:45,125
His glass is quite empty.

91
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:56,750
I hope that you'll stay for
as long as your time permits.

92
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:58,083
Sitting around
the table like this,

93
00:06:58,166 --> 00:07:00,458
it almost feels as if
you're part of the family.

94
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,875
[MONTE CRISTO] What a
maddening scent this is...

95
00:07:12,958 --> 00:07:14,625
Excellency?

96
00:07:14,708 --> 00:07:17,083
It comes from the Muscat grapes.

97
00:07:17,166 --> 00:07:19,791
I hope my visit hasn't
left you too fatigued.

98
00:07:19,875 --> 00:07:22,125
No. Please forgive
me for insisting

99
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:24,458
that you eat that soup
earlier this evening.

100
00:07:24,541 --> 00:07:26,458
I hope I didn't
cause you discomfort.

101
00:07:26,541 --> 00:07:27,875
No, madame.

102
00:07:27,958 --> 00:07:31,125
I had always hoped to enjoy
that delicious flavor again.

103
00:07:31,208 --> 00:07:33,708
It was a sublime
experience for me.

104
00:07:33,791 --> 00:07:35,875
It was a simple
rustic dish.

105
00:07:35,958 --> 00:07:40,041
But it makes me happy to
hear you say that you liked it.

106
00:07:42,375 --> 00:07:44,416
This reminds me
of an old saying.

107
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,375
If I remember
it correctly it goes,

108
00:07:46,458 --> 00:07:48,416
"Those who share bread
and salt and fellowship

109
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:51,750
under the same roof
become eternal friends."

110
00:07:51,833 --> 00:07:54,458
I believe that tradition
comes from Eastern Space.

111
00:07:54,541 --> 00:07:56,458
Yes. Which means
that we will now

112
00:07:56,541 --> 00:07:58,875
become good friends
for all of eternity.

113
00:07:58,958 --> 00:08:01,083
Isn't that nice?

114
00:08:01,166 --> 00:08:02,291
Yes it is.

115
00:08:02,375 --> 00:08:04,833
Unfortunately, this
is not Eastern Space.

116
00:08:04,916 --> 00:08:06,291
It is Paris...

117
00:08:06,375 --> 00:08:09,125
And in Paris, people won't
share their bread and salt,

118
00:08:09,208 --> 00:08:12,625
and everlasting
friendship is impossible.

119
00:08:14,958 --> 00:08:17,041
Your soup was
truly delicious.

120
00:08:17,125 --> 00:08:21,708
Warm and sweet,
it unlocked such memories.

121
00:08:21,791 --> 00:08:23,750
It is something
which gives comfort.

122
00:08:23,833 --> 00:08:27,000
Like a breeze blowing
across the Mediterranean Sea.

123
00:08:27,083 --> 00:08:29,458
Count, I was wondering
if you are familiar

124
00:08:29,541 --> 00:08:31,708
with the town of Marseilles?

125
00:08:31,791 --> 00:08:34,125
You could say that
I am aware of it.

126
00:08:35,541 --> 00:08:37,375
But perhaps it'd
more accurate to say

127
00:08:37,458 --> 00:08:39,916
I never truly
knew it at all.

128
00:08:40,833 --> 00:08:44,583
[PEPPO] Infidelity. Adultery.
Dalliances in the dead of night.

129
00:08:44,666 --> 00:08:45,958
You aristocrats
are as energetic

130
00:08:46,041 --> 00:08:48,541
as the rumors among
the peasants say you are.

131
00:08:48,625 --> 00:08:50,291
You can spare me
your crude comments!

132
00:08:50,375 --> 00:08:52,166
The Count happens
to be a friend of mine.

133
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:54,375
Honestly, you're
such a child.

134
00:08:54,458 --> 00:08:55,958
If people could
become friends simply

135
00:08:56,041 --> 00:08:58,333
by sharing bread and
salt with each other...

136
00:08:58,416 --> 00:08:59,833
...life would be simpler.

137
00:08:59,916 --> 00:09:01,333
What are you talking about?

138
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:04,750
You'll get it little boy,
sooner or later.

139
00:09:12,083 --> 00:09:13,791
[MONTE CRISTO] I am most
grateful to you for allowing me

140
00:09:13,875 --> 00:09:17,083
to experience a day
such as I had today.

141
00:09:17,166 --> 00:09:18,166
Not at all.

142
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:19,416
I'm glad that
I had the opportunity

143
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:22,958
to introduce you to
my mother and father.

144
00:09:23,041 --> 00:09:25,250
To introduce a man I admire.

145
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:27,291
I had a thought...

146
00:09:27,375 --> 00:09:29,083
I would like to invite
you to my residence

147
00:09:29,166 --> 00:09:31,666
on the Champs-Elysees
in the near future.

148
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:34,666
I'd love to come!

149
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:37,708
The Count of Monte Cristo is a
mysterious man, don't you think?

150
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:39,125
Yes.

151
00:09:39,208 --> 00:09:40,333
[ALBERT'S MOM] But there is
a sternness somewhere in him

152
00:09:40,416 --> 00:09:42,458
that keeps people
at arm's length.

153
00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:44,250
[ALBERT] Yeah, well that
just means that compared

154
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:46,625
to the Count, the people
of Paris are dull.

155
00:09:46,708 --> 00:09:47,875
Albert...

156
00:09:47,958 --> 00:09:50,041
I don't know if you
realize this, Mother,

157
00:09:50,125 --> 00:09:52,250
but there's more to
the world than Paris.

158
00:09:52,666 --> 00:09:54,000
Out beyond the city walls,

159
00:09:54,083 --> 00:09:57,083
there's a whole world
that's endlessly captivating.

160
00:09:57,166 --> 00:09:59,958
I think you've changed since
your journey to Luna, Albert.

161
00:10:00,041 --> 00:10:01,958
I've not yet finished
with my journey, Mother.

162
00:10:02,041 --> 00:10:03,458
It's just beginning.

163
00:10:03,541 --> 00:10:07,000
Please don't go to worlds
too far removed from our own.

164
00:10:07,083 --> 00:10:08,666
And you should
exercise some moderation

165
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:10,750
in your association
with the Count.

166
00:10:10,833 --> 00:10:12,833
Oh, please Mother, enough.

167
00:10:12,916 --> 00:10:14,500
You're beginning to sound
just like Franz, you know.

168
00:10:14,583 --> 00:10:16,625
Well, even though
he seems a bit shady,

169
00:10:16,708 --> 00:10:18,458
having our family
establish ties with him

170
00:10:18,541 --> 00:10:20,000
might not be a bad thing.

171
00:10:20,083 --> 00:10:22,000
Especially with this family
about to throw its hat

172
00:10:22,083 --> 00:10:24,041
into the political arena.

173
00:10:26,791 --> 00:10:28,500
[PEPPO] Good grief,
why do aristocrats have

174
00:10:28,583 --> 00:10:30,500
to eat like
this all the time?

175
00:10:30,583 --> 00:10:32,291
[MAID]
Dinner parties, high teas.

176
00:10:32,375 --> 00:10:35,666
It's probably because they
don't have anything else to do.

177
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:38,625
In other words, if you took away
the gluttony, lust, and avarice,

178
00:10:38,708 --> 00:10:40,291
there really wouldn't
be anything left

179
00:10:40,375 --> 00:10:43,041
You just watch
your mouth young lady.

180
00:10:43,125 --> 00:10:44,541
Didn't you think
that their guest today

181
00:10:44,625 --> 00:10:47,333
was rather elegant,
handsome and mysterious?

182
00:10:47,416 --> 00:10:48,333
I'm not so sure.

183
00:10:48,416 --> 00:10:49,750
He wasn't very refined.

184
00:10:49,833 --> 00:10:51,916
That may be true, but he
had a pretty good thing going

185
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,500
with the mistress underneath
the grapevine trellis.

186
00:10:54,583 --> 00:10:55,750
How surprising.

187
00:10:55,833 --> 00:10:57,541
I'd always believed that
the master was the one

188
00:10:57,625 --> 00:10:59,791
and only man in the
world for the mistress.

189
00:10:59,875 --> 00:11:01,708
I think that any
society lady would fall

190
00:11:01,791 --> 00:11:03,666
for that Count if
he worked his magic.

191
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:06,375
Would you please give
it a rest, already!

192

Think what you want

193
00:11:09,583 --> 00:11:11,250
but that was definitely
the face of a woman in love.

194
00:11:11,333 --> 00:11:13,583
If you keep this up,
I'm going to report you.

195
00:11:13,666 --> 00:11:15,458
Oo, I'm scared...

196
00:11:16,875 --> 00:11:18,333
[ALBERT thinking]
That's preposterous.

197
00:11:18,416 --> 00:11:20,125

the world who would do that...

198
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:29,916

199
00:11:35,833 --> 00:11:38,333
Who's in that picture
she's looking at?

200
00:11:45,833 --> 00:11:48,958
Do you think I'm a...
terrible man?

201
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:53,291
[HAIDEE] No. I will stay at
your side for as long as I live.

202
00:11:53,375 --> 00:11:56,083
Even if that means walking
down the path to ruin.

203
00:11:56,166 --> 00:12:00,541
It is not we
who will be ruined.

[MONTE CRISTO] I have come

Hey! Don't touch those!

209
00:12:43,833 --> 00:12:45,000
I hate to break it to you,

210
00:12:45,083 --> 00:12:46,666
but I've gotten into your
father's good graces,

211
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:48,750
so I'll be staying
here for a while.

212
00:12:48,833 --> 00:12:50,541
His "good graces"?

213
00:12:50,625 --> 00:12:54,375
It means that your father
is a man just like any other.

214
00:12:56,625 --> 00:12:58,500
Why don't you give
those bad jokes a rest.

215
00:12:58,583 --> 00:13:00,083
Okay then, setting
aside your father

216
00:13:00,166 --> 00:13:02,041
for the moment, the one
that I'd be worried about

217
00:13:02,125 --> 00:13:04,250
if I were you
is your mother.

218
00:13:04,333 --> 00:13:05,958
What's that
supposed to mean?

219
00:13:06,041 --> 00:13:08,291
I mean, she was standing
there staring wistfully

220
00:13:08,375 --> 00:13:11,000
at that picture
of a young man...

221
00:13:11,083 --> 00:13:12,250
You saw that?

222
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:14,458
Yes, it was definitely
a picture of a young man.

223
00:13:14,541 --> 00:13:17,125
And that young man
wasn't your father.

224
00:13:19,166 --> 00:13:20,125
I understand.

225
00:13:20,208 --> 00:13:21,583
If my mother was
wistfully staring

226
00:13:21,666 --> 00:13:24,541
at a picture of some stranger,
I'd be depressed, too.

227
00:13:24,625 --> 00:13:26,416
That's enough!
Get out!

here to see you, Albert!

you woken up, Albert.

No, ma'am.

Eugenie is your
fiancée, isn't she?

242
00:14:11,375 --> 00:14:12,541
I think it's only natural

00:14:12,625 --> 00:14:14,583
that you should greet
her when she's over.

That reminds me.

250

What's this I hear about

I heard about it from Franz.

He said that the Count called

and asked he and
Maximilian to go too.

00:18:21,666 --> 00:18:25,250
into the cold,
black void of space,

320
00:18:25,333 --> 00:18:28,625
hope was the only thing
I had in my possession.

321
00:18:28,708 --> 00:18:30,333
Nothing else...

322
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:44,041
Are you sure?

323
00:18:44,125 --> 00:18:45,375
This is it.

324
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:47,666
Number thirty Champs-Elysees.
No doubt about it.

325
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:50,750
It's a lot more austere
than I expected it to be.

326
00:18:50,833 --> 00:18:53,208
Considering the Count, I was
expecting the sort of place

327
00:18:53,291 --> 00:18:56,541
that would drive a commoner
into a rage if he saw it.

328
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,791
Good day and welcome, messieurs.

329
00:19:05,875 --> 00:19:09,166
We have been
expecting your arrival.

330
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:11,458
Hm, Early Rococo, huh?

331
00:19:11,541 --> 00:19:13,916
And not Revival, either.

332
00:19:15,625 --> 00:19:17,000
Amazing, huh?

333
00:19:17,083 --> 00:19:20,541
Well, it's a bit too far
removed from my world...

334
00:19:22,041 --> 00:19:23,708
I beg your pardon for the delay.

335
00:19:23,791 --> 00:19:26,625
Please allow me to show
you to His Excellency now.

336
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:29,041
What the hell--?

337
00:19:29,125 --> 00:19:31,375
We're going down!

338
00:19:31,458 --> 00:19:32,250
Where are we going?

339
00:19:32,333 --> 00:19:34,000
Baptistin!

340
00:19:50,291 --> 00:19:52,791
We've stopped!

341
00:19:54,416 --> 00:19:55,291
Welcome, messieurs.

342
00:19:55,375 --> 00:19:57,791
His Excellency awaits.

343
00:19:57,875 --> 00:19:59,666
Wait that's--

344
00:20:17,541 --> 00:20:19,375
[BEAUCHAMP] Even the floor
and columns are gold...

345
00:20:19,458 --> 00:20:21,708
The man has expensive tastes.

346
00:20:21,791 --> 00:20:22,750
Where in the world do you think

347
00:20:22,833 --> 00:20:25,333
he could he have
gotten this much gold?

348
00:20:25,416 --> 00:20:27,625
Now I really think there's
something fishy about him.

349
00:20:27,708 --> 00:20:29,208
[BEAUCHAMP] At this rate,
I bet his bed and pillows

350
00:20:29,291 --> 00:20:31,416
are gonna be
solid gold, too.

351
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:33,375
I could never sleep
with all this glare.

352
00:20:33,458 --> 00:20:35,166
Hey! Wait! Look at that!

353
00:20:37,208 --> 00:20:39,250
Isn't that--?

354
00:20:39,333 --> 00:20:40,416
[FRANZ]
The sea?

355
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,583
[BEAUCHAMP] No, wait.
Look at that sky!

356
00:20:44,125 --> 00:20:45,833
[FRANZ]
It's artificial?

357
00:20:45,916 --> 00:20:48,000
[MAXIMILION]
Unbelievable...

358
00:20:48,083 --> 00:20:51,000
This alone would
make one hell of a story.

359
00:20:57,541 --> 00:21:00,125
This is amazingly beautiful...

360
00:21:01,416 --> 00:21:03,458
I recognize this!

361
00:21:09,833 --> 00:21:12,833
[MONTE CRISTO] That look suits
you quite well, sir pirate.

362
00:21:12,916 --> 00:21:14,500
Excellency!

363
00:21:17,666 --> 00:21:19,125
Why--?

364
00:21:29,041 --> 00:21:30,291
If you don't mind,

365
00:21:30,375 --> 00:21:33,583
I would like you to
have this, good sir pirate.

366
00:21:38,333 --> 00:21:42,750
I was given this fine blade
by a certain ship's navigator.

367
00:21:43,291 --> 00:21:45,375
Perhaps it will
serve to protect you,

368
00:21:45,458 --> 00:21:50,250
as well as to carve a path
for you. A path to your future.

369
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,875
Sometimes the part of
us that selflessly thinks

370
00:23:30,958 --> 00:23:34,291
of others clashes with the
selfish love of our emotions.

371
00:23:34,375 --> 00:23:38,166
Next Gankutsuou,
The Count of Monte Cristo,

372
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:39,875
Act 5: "Do You
Love Your Fiancée?"

373
00:23:39,958 --> 00:23:42,000
Bide your time,
and hold out hope!
