00:19:38,375 --> 00:19:41,458
Sadly Carnival has ended, so
what are your plans now, Albert?

325
00:19:41,541 --> 00:19:44,500
What adventures have you
in store for your future?

326
00:19:44,583 --> 00:19:46,666
[FRANZ] Albert and I are
going to cut our trip short,

327
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:48,625
take the evening
shuttle back to Paris.

328
00:19:48,708 --> 00:19:49,750
Hey, hey!!

329
00:19:49,833 --> 00:19:51,000
Wait a minute!

330
00:19:51,083 --> 00:19:53,583
I can't go, I've already
made plans of my own!

331
00:19:53,666 --> 00:19:55,666
You just never
learn, do you?

332
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:58,250
So then what
are these "plans"?

333
00:19:58,333 --> 00:19:59,500
What do you mean?

334
00:19:59,583 --> 00:20:01,583
That's none of
your business.

335
00:20:01,666 --> 00:20:03,666
Ahh...

336
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:05,916
Perhaps...
you've a rendezvous?

337
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,791
Uh! Sort of...

338
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:12,583
Love is a wonderful thing.

339
00:20:12,666 --> 00:20:17,333
However, perhaps
you have not yet noticed.

340
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:18,541
Or perhaps you knew,

341
00:20:18,625 --> 00:20:20,916
and arranged the
rendezvous regardless.

342
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,166
I do hate to be the bearer
of bad tidings, but...

343
00:20:28,708 --> 00:20:31,000
What? She's a boy?

344
00:20:31,083 --> 00:20:33,083
She's a boy?!

345
00:20:35,791 --> 00:20:36,750
[ALBERT]
Come out and say it!

346
00:20:36,833 --> 00:20:38,041
You think I'm an
idiot, don't you?!

347
00:20:38,125 --> 00:20:38,791
[FRANZ]
Not really.

348
00:20:38,875 --> 00:20:40,291
Yeah, right.

349
00:20:40,375 --> 00:20:42,708
You're always looking down
on me, always laughing at me!

350
00:20:45,041 --> 00:20:47,000
I'm not laughing at you!

351
00:20:47,083 --> 00:20:49,125
If I laughed at every
bonehead stunt you pulled,

352
00:20:49,208 --> 00:20:51,125
I'd laugh myself to death!

353
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:53,750
Anyway, you were--

354
00:20:56,583 --> 00:20:58,458
Thank you Franz...

355
00:20:58,541 --> 00:21:00,458
I owe you my life.

356
00:21:02,958 --> 00:21:05,333
I really appreciate it.

357
00:21:20,708 --> 00:21:22,458
[MONTE CRISTO]
The bitter fruits of betrayal

358
00:21:22,541 --> 00:21:25,875
must be plucked from the tree...

359
00:23:28,708 --> 00:23:31,375
[NARRATOR] At long last,
the appointed day arrives.

360
00:23:31,458 --> 00:23:33,958
He comes to Paris along
with a summer storm.

361
00:23:34,041 --> 00:23:37,541
Next Gankutsuou,
The Count of Monte Cristo,

362
00:23:37,625 --> 00:23:39,416
Act 3: "5/22, Stormy."

363
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:41,583
Bide your time,
and hold out hope!
