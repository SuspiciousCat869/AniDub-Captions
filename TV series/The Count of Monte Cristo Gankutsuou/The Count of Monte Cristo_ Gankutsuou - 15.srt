1
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:52,958
[NARRATOR] Madames and
Messieurs, good evening.

2
00:01:53,041 --> 00:01:55,541
Anguish. Anxiety.

3
00:01:55,625 --> 00:01:57,791
Because his soul
is pure and innocent,

4
00:01:57,875 --> 00:01:59,250
it is all the more susceptible

5
00:01:59,333 --> 00:02:01,500
to becoming troubled
and tarnished.

6
00:02:01,583 --> 00:02:04,625
The tarnish becomes
an indelible stain,

7
00:02:04,708 --> 00:02:06,916
a stain that gradually spreads.

8
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,500
When one is no longer
able to trust others,

9
00:02:10,583 --> 00:02:14,833
is that when one
truly becomes an adult?

10
00:02:41,958 --> 00:02:43,416
This is so amazing!

11
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,541
The Earth looks
so small from here.

12
00:02:45,625 --> 00:02:46,500
[MONTE CRISTO]
Yes.

13
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:47,791
In the vast cosmos,

14
00:02:47,875 --> 00:02:50,458
it is nothing more than
a tiny speck of dust.

15
00:02:50,541 --> 00:02:52,875
And what's more, separated
from Earth by a distance

16
00:02:52,958 --> 00:02:56,625
of 25 light years as we are
now, the light of our world

17
00:02:56,708 --> 00:02:57,875
you are looking at,

18
00:02:57,958 --> 00:03:01,541
was reflected off the
surface 25 years ago.

19
00:03:01,625 --> 00:03:03,875
25 years ago?

20
00:03:05,041 --> 00:03:07,916
Indeed. A lifetime...

21
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:11,166
[ALBERT]
Thank you.

22
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:13,583
I'm glad you
brought me with you.

23
00:03:13,666 --> 00:03:16,000
Looking at them across
space, all the things that

24
00:03:16,083 --> 00:03:19,916
I was agonizing over seem
so small and insignificant.

25
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,500
[MONTE CRISTO]
Perhaps, but you must beware.

26
00:03:22,583 --> 00:03:26,833
Hatred and malice are amplified
in the darkness of space.

27
00:03:26,916 --> 00:03:28,875
[ALBERT]
Huh?

28
00:03:42,541 --> 00:03:45,416
[EUGENIE sighs]
Everyone has gone away now...

29
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:48,958
Franz has left, so has Albert.

30
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,500
[EUGENIE] Thanks for coming
on such short notice.

31
00:03:53,583 --> 00:03:55,541
[FRANZ]
It's fine, I wanted to see you.

32
00:03:55,625 --> 00:03:58,541
I'm going to have to go
away for a little while.

33
00:03:59,875 --> 00:04:01,833
So will Albert
be going with you?

34
00:04:01,916 --> 00:04:05,083
No. Apparently, he went off
somewhere on a trip of his own.

35
00:04:05,166 --> 00:04:07,833
Even though his father's in
the middle of a big campaign.

36
00:04:07,916 --> 00:04:09,250
Can you believe him?

37
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:10,958
What do you mean somewhere?

38
00:04:11,041 --> 00:04:12,250
I'm sorry.

39
00:04:12,333 --> 00:04:15,333
I just don't know
anymore than you do.

40
00:04:15,416 --> 00:04:16,416
[EUGENIE]
I see.

41
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,041
The one thing
I can say for sure is...

42
00:04:18,125 --> 00:04:19,541
...is that he's gotten
himself mixed up

43
00:04:19,625 --> 00:04:21,541
in something
potentially dangerous

44
00:04:21,625 --> 00:04:25,458
and still hasn't managed
to figure that out.

45
00:04:25,541 --> 00:04:27,416
Franz, I, you know I--

46
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:30,375
Yes I know. You're a
victim of this, too.

47
00:04:31,083 --> 00:04:33,666
Listen, whatever happens
from this moment on,

48
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:35,416
don't forget who you are.

49
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:39,000
[FRANZ] Look for the truth
with your own eyes.

50
00:04:57,333 --> 00:04:59,375
[MONTE CRISTO] Before I
happily made your acquaintance

51
00:04:59,458 --> 00:05:01,416
I traveled about the universe,

52
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:04,375
operating this entire
ship by myself.

53
00:05:04,458 --> 00:05:07,041
You flew a huge ship
like this by yourself?!

54
00:05:07,125 --> 00:05:08,583
Yes.

55
00:05:08,666 --> 00:05:10,958
At the time, I was quite proud
of the fact that I was able

56
00:05:11,041 --> 00:05:14,583
to develop sufficient skills
to operate it single-handedly.

57
00:05:14,666 --> 00:05:17,541
Come. I want you to
take a look at something.

58
00:05:17,625 --> 00:05:18,791
What is that?

59
00:05:18,875 --> 00:05:20,333
[MONTE CRISTO]
The Milky Way.

60
00:05:20,416 --> 00:05:23,416
In the ancient Orient, it was
called the River of Heaven.

61
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:24,833
[ALBERT]
River of Heaven?

62
00:05:24,916 --> 00:05:28,291
This is what I have been
wishing to show to you.

63
00:05:28,375 --> 00:05:30,541
It's just so beautiful...

64
00:05:30,625 --> 00:05:33,291
[MONTE CRISTO] According to
legend, two lovers live on

65
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:35,500
the opposite banks
of the galaxy separated

66
00:05:35,583 --> 00:05:38,500
from one another by
the River of Heaven.

67
00:05:38,583 --> 00:05:40,791
They say that once a year,

68
00:05:40,875 --> 00:05:42,958
they cross the river
and are reunited.

69
00:05:43,041 --> 00:05:45,708
[ALBERT] That's a romantic
story, don't you think?

70
00:05:47,125 --> 00:05:49,375
[MONTE CRISTO]
Long ago, I had a friend,

71
00:05:49,458 --> 00:05:51,916
a sailor who was
born in Marseilles.

72
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,416
I heard that story
many times from him.

73
00:05:56,208 --> 00:05:57,416
Well if that's the case,

74
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:01,541
I bet that your friend
was very much in love.

75
00:06:01,625 --> 00:06:04,958
This sailor of which I speak
had a beautiful fiancée.

76
00:06:05,041 --> 00:06:08,333
And a best friend with
whom he felt at ease.

77
00:06:08,416 --> 00:06:10,416
[MONTE CRISTO] These three
were childhood friends,

78
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:13,375
and were always keeping
an eye out for one another.

79
00:06:13,458 --> 00:06:15,833
Indeed, they were
very much like you,

80
00:06:15,916 --> 00:06:19,083
Monsieur Franz, and
Mademoiselle Eugenie.

81
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:22,791
Unfortunately,
over the years together,

82
00:06:22,875 --> 00:06:26,708
the best friend had fallen in
love with the sailor's fiancée.

83
00:06:26,791 --> 00:06:27,958
And then,

84
00:06:28,041 --> 00:06:30,833
the friend, who became
obsessed with the idea

85
00:06:30,916 --> 00:06:34,000
of having her and would stop at
nothing to possess the fiancée,

86
00:06:34,083 --> 00:06:38,250
framed the sailor for a
crime which he did not commit.

87
00:06:39,083 --> 00:06:42,458
Unbeknownst to anyone, the poor
sailor spent more than a decade,

88
00:06:42,541 --> 00:06:47,125
chained up in a prison located
in the depths of space.

89
00:06:54,583 --> 00:06:56,333
I can't believe it...

90
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:58,083
[MONTE CRISTO]
But a miracle occurred,

91
00:06:58,166 --> 00:06:59,500
and the sailor was set free,

92
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:02,041
whereupon he returned
to Marseilles.

93
00:07:02,125 --> 00:07:04,000
Oh, that's good
I'm relieved to hear that.

94
00:07:04,083 --> 00:07:05,291
[MONTE CRISTO]
However...

95
00:07:05,375 --> 00:07:07,958
...that beautiful fiancée,
rather than waiting

96
00:07:08,041 --> 00:07:10,041
for the sailor's return...

97
00:07:10,125 --> 00:07:13,208
...had become engaged
to his friend instead.

98
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,458
So sad...

99
00:07:17,541 --> 00:07:19,166
[ALBERT]
I wonder why she didn't wait

100
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:21,750
for the sailor to come home.

101
00:07:21,833 --> 00:07:24,583
[MONTE CRISTO] Also, why did
the sailor's friend steal away

102
00:07:24,666 --> 00:07:27,375
his fiancée in spite
of their friendship?

103
00:07:27,458 --> 00:07:29,458
The sailor, having
been betrayed by both

104
00:07:29,541 --> 00:07:34,958
his best friend and his fiancée,
never returned to Earth again.

105
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:41,083
[MONTE CRISTO]
Albert, why do you cry?

106
00:07:41,166 --> 00:07:42,750
[ALBERT]
I don't know...

107
00:07:42,833 --> 00:07:47,291
Until just recently
I was just like you are,

108
00:07:47,375 --> 00:07:49,750
I never thought I could
believe in anyone.

109
00:07:49,833 --> 00:07:52,375
That's what I told myself.

110
00:07:52,458 --> 00:07:55,291
But for some reason,
when I see your face...

111
00:07:55,375 --> 00:07:57,916
...the very thought of living
that way seems to me like...

112
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,458
...like the saddest and
loneliest thing in the world.

113
00:08:05,083 --> 00:08:06,291
Promise me Count.

114
00:08:06,375 --> 00:08:07,958
Promise me that
we'll always make sure

115
00:08:08,041 --> 00:08:10,416
that our friendship is
the exception to the rule.

116
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:11,666
At the very least,

117
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:14,166
you're the one person
in my life I can trust!

118
00:08:16,416 --> 00:08:18,166
The watch that I gave you,

119
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:21,250
is it still ticking away
the time as it should?

120
00:08:21,333 --> 00:08:27,208
[ticking]

121
00:08:27,291 --> 00:08:31,041
[MONTE CRISTO] Albert, I shall
be departing Paris sometime

122
00:08:31,125 --> 00:08:33,125
in the near future.

123
00:08:34,541 --> 00:08:36,458
[ALBERT] What do you
mean you're departing?

124
00:08:36,541 --> 00:08:38,500
But, your Excellency
this is so sudden!

125
00:08:38,583 --> 00:08:41,083
Wait a minute, it's not
because of your illness, is it?

126
00:08:41,166 --> 00:08:42,583
Not at all.

127
00:08:42,666 --> 00:08:44,666
The reason I came here is
that there was a certain matter

128
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:46,375
that I had to see to in Paris,

129
00:08:46,458 --> 00:08:48,041
which is why I have
kept my residence

130
00:08:48,125 --> 00:08:50,041
in town on the Champs Elysees.

131
00:08:50,125 --> 00:08:53,458
However, the task I came
to accomplish will soon

132
00:08:53,541 --> 00:08:55,958
be coming to its
final conclusion.

133
00:08:56,041 --> 00:09:06,041
[CROWD cheering, chanting]
Morcerf! Morcerf! Morcerf...

134

[CROWD cheering, chanting]
Morcerf! Morcerf! Morcerf...

135
00:09:14,833 --> 00:09:15,958
[ALBERT]
No, don't say that!

136
00:09:16,041 --> 00:09:18,083
Please, stay in Paris for good!

137
00:09:18,166 --> 00:09:20,583
Or if staying in
Paris isn't possible...

138
00:09:20,666 --> 00:09:23,291
...then I want you to take
me with you when you go!

139
00:09:23,375 --> 00:09:26,375
I don't think I could
bear being apart from you!

140
00:09:27,708 --> 00:09:28,958
I'm moved Albert...

141
00:09:29,041 --> 00:09:31,458
I didn't realize you
thought that highly of me.

142
00:09:31,541 --> 00:09:32,958
I do!

143
00:09:35,458 --> 00:09:38,666
Your youthful passion
will cool to a wiser reason.

144
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:40,041
That's not true Count!

145
00:09:40,125 --> 00:09:44,041
To me you are...
I mean the way I feel is...

146
00:09:46,291 --> 00:09:48,375
[MONTE CRISTO]
One day...

147
00:09:48,458 --> 00:09:50,375
One day I will ask you how all

148
00:09:50,458 --> 00:09:52,458
that has happened
has affected you.

149
00:09:52,541 --> 00:09:55,708
I can't help but to wonder
if you'll feel the same

150
00:09:55,791 --> 00:09:58,708
when that time finally comes?

151
00:10:02,041 --> 00:10:05,083
[BERTUCCIO] Excellency,
there's a message from Paris.

If you will pardon me.

[FRANZ] Monsieur Noirtier...
Please, you have to tell me.

Tell me what Gankutsuou is.

In the event of an emergency,

00:11:13,833 --> 00:11:15,875
it is possible for a

the password to use this pen
to make contact with its owner.

we have met somewhere before.

[HAIDEE] You were a patriot
defending our country.

[SPADA] Stand by for
atmospheric reentry.

316
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:30,125
[ALBERT]
Everything was a lie.

317
00:23:30,208 --> 00:23:32,000
The tiny rip becomes
an enormous tear,

318
00:23:32,083 --> 00:23:35,666
and everything I had believed
in falls and is swallowed up.

319
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:39,083
Next Gankutsuou, The Count
of Monte Cristo, Act 16:

320
00:23:39,166 --> 00:23:40,083
"Scandal."

321
00:23:40,166 --> 00:23:42,250
Bide your time,
and hold out hope!
