00:01:49,458 --> 00:01:53,333
[NARRATOR] Madames and
Messieurs, good evening.

2
00:01:53,416 --> 00:01:56,208
Everything lies in ruin.

3
00:01:56,291 --> 00:01:58,416
What was once believed
to be solid ground

4
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:02,541
has opened up and
swallowed everything.

5
00:02:02,625 --> 00:02:04,708
The young soul
wanders aimlessly,

6
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:08,000
betrayed by everything
he had believed in.

7
00:02:08,083 --> 00:02:14,000
But then in the end what
he clutches tightest to is...

8
00:02:55,416 --> 00:02:58,000
[ALBERT] Someone taught me
the meaning of the word hope.

9
00:02:58,083 --> 00:03:01,208
Count, that someone was you!

10
00:03:14,708 --> 00:03:17,041
[FRANZ]
Wait for me, Albert!

11
00:03:23,208 --> 00:03:24,916
[MAID B]
Mademoiselle.

12
00:03:25,875 --> 00:03:28,000
Pardon me but a
letter's arrived for you.

13
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:29,791
Thanks, I'll take it.

14
00:03:44,083 --> 00:03:46,458
[ALBERT]
Why aren't you saying anything?

15
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:52,750
[ALBERT] Why are you just
standing there not answering me?

16
00:03:54,833 --> 00:03:56,666
I think I understand.

17
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:59,083
My words now fall on deaf ears.

18
00:03:59,166 --> 00:04:03,375
Is that... Is that what
you're trying to say?!

19
00:04:04,833 --> 00:04:07,166
[MONTE CRISTO]
I once told you

20
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:10,416
that there is no such
thing as coincidence.

21
00:04:11,791 --> 00:04:14,708
It's the very first
thing I told you.

22
00:04:14,791 --> 00:04:17,666
Everything happens
out of necessity.

23
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:19,583
What is it you're
trying to say to me?

24
00:04:20,541 --> 00:04:23,000
[MONTE CRISTO] Tell me,
Albert, if Haidee were not

25
00:04:23,083 --> 00:04:26,125
a living witness to your
father's true identity...

26
00:04:26,208 --> 00:04:28,458
...what value would
there be in keeping her

27
00:04:28,541 --> 00:04:30,166
with me all this time?

28
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:31,666
[HAIDEE gasps]

29
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:33,250
[ALBERT gasps]

30
00:04:33,333 --> 00:04:35,958
[MONTE CRISTO] Tell me, if you
were not Fernand Mondego's son,

31
00:04:36,041 --> 00:04:37,625
why would it have
been necessary for me

32
00:04:37,708 --> 00:04:40,666
to meet you the
way I did on Luna?

33
00:04:42,666 --> 00:04:44,125
Can't be...

34
00:04:44,208 --> 00:04:49,333
So From the beginning,
you were only just using me?

35
00:04:49,416 --> 00:04:50,708
[MONTE CRISTO]
That's right.

36
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:53,666
I met you under a convenient
pretense of coincidence.

37
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:56,333
I took full advantage of
our so-called "friendship"

38
00:04:56,416 --> 00:05:00,041
a task made easy by the
unshaking faith you had in it.

39
00:05:00,125 --> 00:05:01,666
That's what I'm saying.

40
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:05,583
I even used props such as
the watch you're holding.

41
00:05:10,083 --> 00:05:11,375
[ALBERT]
Can't be...

42
00:05:11,458 --> 00:05:16,083
So from the beginning,
you were only just using me?

43
00:05:16,166 --> 00:05:18,833
Liar! You're lying!
You're lying!

44
00:05:18,916 --> 00:05:20,583
I can't believe
what you're saying.

45
00:05:20,666 --> 00:05:22,791
It's been a set up
from the beginning?

46
00:05:22,875 --> 00:05:24,583
It's not true!

47
00:05:25,791 --> 00:05:28,000
[ALBERT] I mean, haven't you
always gone out of your way

48
00:05:28,083 --> 00:05:29,833
to help me when I needed it?

49
00:05:29,916 --> 00:05:33,208
Haven't you been looking out
for me and giving me advice?

50
00:05:34,583 --> 00:05:37,291
I just don't believe that all
of the time we spent together

51
00:05:37,375 --> 00:05:40,208
since we met was nothing
more than a big lie!

52
00:05:40,291 --> 00:05:42,291
It can't be!

53
00:06:00,625 --> 00:06:02,291
[MONTE CRISTO chuckles]

54
00:06:04,375 --> 00:06:06,041
You poor, foolish boy.

55
00:06:06,125 --> 00:06:08,166
You still wish to remain
completely immersed

56
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:11,416
in those childish and
naive delusions of yours?

57
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,916
[MONTE CRSITO] Is that what
you are trying to say?

58
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,875
Even though I
deliberately brought you

59
00:06:16,958 --> 00:06:19,583
with me on that extended
pleasure cruise that day,

60
00:06:19,666 --> 00:06:21,750
knowing full well
that Haidee was about

61
00:06:21,833 --> 00:06:24,500
to disclose the truth
to the Assembly?

62
00:06:25,958 --> 00:06:35,916
[MONTE CRISTO laughing]

63
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,541
[MONTE CRISTO laughing]

64
00:06:43,583 --> 00:06:45,458
I thank you...

65
00:06:45,541 --> 00:06:48,125
You have been most useful
to me in the short time

66
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:50,541
that we have known each other.

67
00:06:51,416 --> 00:06:56,666
I am forever... grateful to you.

68
00:07:26,958 --> 00:07:28,708
I challenge you!

69
00:07:28,791 --> 00:07:32,000
[MONTE CRISTO]
My, how old-fashioned.

70
00:07:32,083 --> 00:07:35,708
The son of a soldier must act
in accordance with tradition...

71
00:07:35,791 --> 00:07:38,458
Is that what you're doing now?

72
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:41,166
[ALBERT] The time will be
tomorrow morning at 5AM...

73
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:43,166
...in the forest of Boulogne.

74
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:45,000
[MONTE CRISTO]
Weapons?

75
00:07:45,083 --> 00:07:47,625
Full armor and Long-swords.

76
00:07:47,708 --> 00:07:49,416
[MONTE CRISTO]
Very well.

77
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:52,666
Bertuccio. You are my
witness in this matter.

78
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:55,625
Did you see the whole challenge
from beginning to end?

79
00:07:55,708 --> 00:07:57,708
Yes, Count!

80
00:08:01,416 --> 00:08:02,500
Fine Albert!

81
00:08:02,583 --> 00:08:04,833
I accept your challenge.

82
00:08:06,583 --> 00:08:10,583
I'll see you tomorrow
morning at five!

83
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:34,625
[ALBERT grunts]

84
00:08:47,375 --> 00:08:50,083
[MONTE CRISTO]
It's a way to keep this day,

85
00:08:50,166 --> 00:08:53,583
this very hour
stuck fast in time.

86
00:09:12,833 --> 00:09:15,250
[MERCEDES]
I must go to see him.

87
00:09:15,333 --> 00:09:17,541
Without delay.

88
00:09:28,916 --> 00:09:31,708
[HAIDEE] Excellency, is
there nothing I can do

89
00:09:31,791 --> 00:09:34,666
or say that will persuade
you to stop this duel

90
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:36,750
between you and Albert?

91
00:09:38,125 --> 00:09:40,375
On the first day
I met you told me

92
00:09:40,458 --> 00:09:43,083
that I am free to do as I wish.

93
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:44,625
That is what allowed me to live

94
00:09:44,708 --> 00:09:48,916
to this day without
taking my own life.

95
00:09:49,416 --> 00:09:50,875
But if you...

96
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:54,750
If you were to perish amidst
all this horrible ugliness...

97
00:09:55,416 --> 00:09:56,500
I wouldn't...

98
00:09:56,583 --> 00:09:59,250
...be able to go on living.

00:09:59,333 --> 00:10:05,291
[MONTE CRISTO groaning]

[MONTE CRISTO]
Gankutsuou... Wait... Not yet!

00:10:11,708 --> 00:10:15,416
No... It's not... yet time!

102
00:10:39,458 --> 00:10:42,541
Is that Franz?

103
00:10:42,625 --> 00:10:44,708
That's Albert!

[BOTH panting]

[ALBERT]
I'm sorry...

106
00:11:02,083 --> 00:11:05,041
You've always been
looking out for me...

107
00:11:05,125 --> 00:11:07,583
...but I'd always plunge ahead

108
00:11:07,666 --> 00:11:10,500
with what I was doing,
ignoring your advice.

109
00:11:10,583 --> 00:11:14,666
I'm so... sorry Franz.
I'm sorry.

110
00:11:17,625 --> 00:11:20,125
Well I'm back now.

111
00:11:21,125 --> 00:11:22,750
Welcome home Franz.

112
00:11:25,291 --> 00:11:27,583
Just wipe off your nose.

Don't boss me, Franz 

114

[FRANZ]
You idiot!

115
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:35,875
Don't you realize you
played right into his hands!

116
00:11:35,958 --> 00:11:39,041
Albert you've got to call
off this duel right away!

117
00:11:39,125 --> 00:11:40,250
[ALBERT]
Cut it out!

118
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:42,125
I know you don't
want me to do this

119
00:11:42,208 --> 00:11:44,333
but I want you
to act as my second.

120
00:11:45,875 --> 00:11:48,208
I don't blame you for
being angry with me.

121
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:50,541
But Franz you've got to
understand this is one thing

122
00:11:50,625 --> 00:11:53,416
that I have to see through,
no matter what!

123
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,208
Albert listen to me.

124
00:11:55,291 --> 00:11:56,875
I'm certain that the
Count has been planning

125
00:11:56,958 --> 00:11:58,458
to kill you all along.

126
00:11:58,541 --> 00:11:59,958
Are you saying
that you don't care

127
00:12:00,041 --> 00:12:02,250
if you end up dead for
the sake of his revenge?!

128
00:12:02,333 --> 00:12:04,166
Stop it Franz.

129
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:05,708
That bastard lied to me

130
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:08,708
and used dirty tricks
in order to lure me in.

131
00:12:08,791 --> 00:12:11,166
He used the most despicable
means imaginable

132
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:13,541
to toy with me and turn
my life upside-down.

133
00:12:13,625 --> 00:12:14,875
And I can't...

134
00:12:14,958 --> 00:12:17,000
I can't let him
get away with it!

135
00:12:21,666 --> 00:12:23,291
[FRANZ] Would you still
feel that way even if

136
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:27,000
that fake count used to
be your mother's fiancé?

137
00:12:27,625 --> 00:12:28,791
[FRANZ]
The fact is,

138
00:12:28,875 --> 00:12:30,750
your father was so in
love with your mother,

139
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:32,958
that 25 years ago,
he framed the Count

140
00:12:33,041 --> 00:12:37,208
for a crime he didn't commit and
took his fiancée away by force.

But you really are
Edmond Danes, aren't you?

Oh, how I've missed you...

00:13:20,375 --> 00:13:22,375
I was lost without you.

But you were in my heart.

forgotten you for an instant.

one more time,

00:14:05,958 --> 00:14:10,458
There is no longer anything of
Edmond himself left within it.

161
00:14:10,541 --> 00:14:12,791
It's not true.

162
00:14:12,875 --> 00:14:16,583
No! It isn't possible!

163
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:22,166
[MERCEDES] If that were
the truth, why have I had

164
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:26,333
the feeling ever since the day
we met that you are Edmond?

165
00:14:39,916 --> 00:14:42,250
[MONTE CRISTO]
You refuse to be disturbed

166
00:14:42,333 --> 00:14:46,000
by the coldness of my hand...

167
00:14:46,083 --> 00:14:48,833
You leave me no choice, then.

168
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:56,375
I will show you absolute
proof that Edmond Dantes,

169
00:14:56,458 --> 00:15:00,541
the man you once loved,
is dead and gone forever.

170
00:15:08,791 --> 00:15:11,333
[MONTE CRISTO]
Until 5AM tomorrow morning

171
00:15:11,416 --> 00:15:13,500
in the forest of Boulogne.

172
00:15:32,958 --> 00:15:35,000
[ALBERT]
It's already too late, Franz.

173
00:15:35,458 --> 00:15:36,583
[FRANZ gasps]

174
00:15:36,666 --> 00:15:38,750
[ALBERT] Too late to do
anything about that!

175
00:15:38,833 --> 00:15:40,666
You see whatever
happened between the Count

176
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:42,666
and my parents
belongs in the past.

177
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:45,875
I couldn't care less about
any of that stuff anymore!

178
00:15:45,958 --> 00:15:47,291
But I can't forgive
what happened

179
00:15:47,375 --> 00:15:51,708
with me and the Count.
And I won't just let that go.

180
00:15:51,791 --> 00:15:53,250
[ALBERT]
If he hates me that much,

181
00:15:53,333 --> 00:15:55,125
then he should just
go ahead and kill me

182
00:15:55,208 --> 00:15:56,583
and be done with it!

183
00:15:56,666 --> 00:15:57,541
Damn it!

184
00:15:57,625 --> 00:15:59,666
The Count, the bastard.

185
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:02,375
He played with my feelings!

186
00:16:02,458 --> 00:16:04,875
Albert! Don't do it! Don't go!

187
00:16:04,958 --> 00:16:06,625
Come back!

188
00:16:06,708 --> 00:16:08,416
Albert!

189
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:12,958
[FRANZ]
Please, come back...

190
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:28,541
[FRANZ]
You're still going to see him,

191
00:16:28,625 --> 00:16:30,541
even though he
might kill you?

192
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:37,833
[ALBERT yelling]

193
00:16:45,875 --> 00:16:51,541
[ALBERT panting]

194
00:17:41,708 --> 00:17:42,500
Eugenie!

195
00:17:42,583 --> 00:17:45,458
Oh you're back! That's great!

196
00:17:47,458 --> 00:17:49,541
Welcome home!

197
00:17:50,916 --> 00:17:52,500
So is Albert here?

198
00:17:52,583 --> 00:17:57,000
Uh... No. But I was
with him a little while ago.

199
00:17:57,083 --> 00:17:59,541
He said he had
something to take care of.

200
00:17:59,625 --> 00:18:02,625
Oh, he did?

201
00:18:02,708 --> 00:18:04,208
At least you're here.

202
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:07,458
I haven't been able to reach you
since that day you left Paris.

203
00:18:07,541 --> 00:18:09,333
Well I'm sorry
that I worried you.

204
00:18:09,416 --> 00:18:10,583
[EUGENIE]
Honestly, Franz.

205
00:18:10,666 --> 00:18:12,833
I was just worried
sick about you.

206
00:18:12,916 --> 00:18:15,041
Oh, but you timed
your return back

207
00:18:15,125 --> 00:18:16,833
to Paris just perfectly.

208
00:18:16,916 --> 00:18:18,708
Hm?

209
00:18:23,125 --> 00:18:24,791
Oh Franz, don't you remember?

210
00:18:24,875 --> 00:18:27,083
Tomorrow is
Albert's 16th birthday!

211
00:18:27,166 --> 00:18:30,708
Uh... Yeah, exactly!
I knew that.

212
00:18:30,791 --> 00:18:33,125
That's the reason why
I came over here to see you!

213
00:18:33,208 --> 00:18:36,416
Geez, get your
act together. Okay?

214
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:37,500
By the way.

215
00:18:37,583 --> 00:18:39,458
I wrote a new
song just for Albert!

216
00:18:39,541 --> 00:18:41,500
[EUGENIE]
But it's not finished yet.

What do you think?

220
00:19:05,666 --> 00:19:08,916
Mm. It's nice.

221
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,250
It's very romantic.

222
00:19:10,333 --> 00:19:11,750
Really not like you at all.

223
00:19:11,833 --> 00:19:14,750
What do you mean?!
Don't be rude!

224
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:25,000
[FRANZ laughing]

225
00:19:25,083 --> 00:19:28,000
[EUGENIE giggling]

226
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:29,583
[FRANZ]
Well, It's settled!

227
00:19:29,666 --> 00:19:33,875
Tomorrow the three of us will
have a party at our usual cafe!

228
00:19:33,958 --> 00:19:36,750
I can't. I'm sorry.

229
00:19:36,833 --> 00:19:38,458
[FRANZ]
Just say that a friend of yours

230
00:19:38,541 --> 00:19:40,333
is having a recital or
something, and sneak out.

231
00:19:40,416 --> 00:19:42,041
I'm sure it'll work out.

232
00:19:44,333 --> 00:19:45,833
[EUGENIE]
I'll do it.

233
00:19:45,916 --> 00:19:48,291
[FRANZ] Eugenie, do you think
you can do me a little favor?

234
00:19:48,375 --> 00:19:49,625
[EUGENIE]
What kind?

235
00:19:49,708 --> 00:19:51,000
[FRANZ]
I wrote a personal message

236
00:19:51,083 --> 00:19:55,541
in a birthday card for Albert,
but, I feel like...

237
00:19:55,625 --> 00:19:58,041
...I think we're a little too
old for that kind of thing

238
00:19:58,125 --> 00:19:59,208
so I feel awkward.

239
00:19:59,291 --> 00:20:01,708
Idiot, who cares
how old you are?

240
00:20:01,791 --> 00:20:03,125
It's just a card.

241
00:20:03,208 --> 00:20:04,750
I suppose you're right.

242
00:20:04,833 --> 00:20:06,666
Anyway, would you
give it to Albert for me

243
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:08,208
after I leave tomorrow?

244
00:20:08,291 --> 00:20:10,208
Please? I'm begging you.

245
00:20:13,083 --> 00:20:16,208
Must be a surprise. Okay, sure.

246
00:20:16,291 --> 00:20:17,708
I'll do it.

247
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:19,916
I think I'm gonna keep working
on that song for a while.

248
00:20:20,541 --> 00:20:22,583
[FRANZ]
You have fun.

249
00:20:22,666 --> 00:20:24,583
I'll see you
tomorrow at 3, then.

250
00:20:24,666 --> 00:20:26,958
At our usual cafe.

floor with that coward!

Just you watch me do it!
