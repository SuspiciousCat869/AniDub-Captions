[FARIA] Madams and Messieurs,
good evening.

2
00:01:53,916 --> 00:01:57,250
My friend invited three
families to his villa,

3
00:01:57,333 --> 00:02:00,166
where a forbidden
past lay dormant.

4
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:03,000
When that soul which
had been interred there

5
00:02:03,083 --> 00:02:04,750
returned to life...

6
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:11,708
...I sensed clearly that a new
vengeance was about to sprout.

7
00:02:33,458 --> 00:02:35,000
Somebody!

8
00:02:35,083 --> 00:02:36,125
It's an emergency!

00:02:36,208 --> 00:02:37,833
Somebody, send for a doctor!

10
00:02:37,916 --> 00:02:39,708
What's the matter, Albert?

11
00:02:39,791 --> 00:02:41,875
Oh, Marquise,
it's Madame Danglars!

12
00:02:41,958 --> 00:02:44,166
She got sick and collapsed!

13
00:02:48,541 --> 00:02:49,916
[VILLEFORT]
Enough is enough!

14
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,416
What the hell
are you after, Sir?!

15
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,125
Just what is your game?!

16
00:02:54,208 --> 00:02:55,291
[MONTE CRISTO laughs]

17
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:56,625
Surely you jest.

18
00:02:56,708 --> 00:02:58,583
I can assure you that
my only goal tonight is

19
00:02:58,666 --> 00:03:02,583
to have all my guests enjoy
the party I've thrown for them.

20
00:03:02,666 --> 00:03:04,041
You've gone too far!

21
00:03:04,125 --> 00:03:06,500
I'm sure you know this
manor was originally owned

22
00:03:06,583 --> 00:03:08,083
by my father-in-law.

23
00:03:08,166 --> 00:03:12,375
If you're deliberately trying
to insult me, You'll regret it!

[MONTE CRISTO laughs]

25
00:03:19,166 --> 00:03:21,041
Even though I was
unaware of that fact,

26
00:03:21,125 --> 00:03:23,875
it seems I have
indeed been most rude.

27
00:03:23,958 --> 00:03:29,166
But still this is
a most fascinating...

28
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:32,375
...not to mention a
most odd, coincidence.

29
00:03:32,458 --> 00:03:34,583
Which means, that
this place must be

30
00:03:34,666 --> 00:03:37,083
as familiar to you as
the back of your hand.

31
00:03:37,166 --> 00:03:39,166
Isn't that right Monsieur?

32
00:03:40,125 --> 00:03:42,166
In which case, my humble attempt

33
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:46,041
to entertain you all
was unfair from the start.

34
00:03:46,125 --> 00:03:47,791
This just won't do.

35
00:03:47,875 --> 00:03:51,958
Shall we start over
and try our game again?

[MERCEDES]
Albert.

37
00:03:54,291 --> 00:03:56,583
What in the world happened
to Madame Danglars?

38
00:04:00,666 --> 00:04:02,083
I'm not sure.

39
00:04:02,166 --> 00:04:04,708
All of us were going along
and playing the Count's game.

40
00:04:04,791 --> 00:04:06,750
I was about to give
Madame Victoria the box

41
00:04:06,833 --> 00:04:10,333
with the prize in it,
and the instant I did, she--

42
00:04:15,125 --> 00:04:18,750
I just don't know,
why she fainted.

43
00:04:19,625 --> 00:04:22,458
I don't understand
how this can be...

44
00:04:23,125 --> 00:04:24,958
Poor boy...

...forgive me...

[MONTE CRISTO] It seems
to be a case of anemia.

47
00:04:29,583 --> 00:04:30,750
It's nothing serious.

48
00:04:30,833 --> 00:04:32,333
[VILLEFORT]
I ask you again.

Precisely what do you know?

Your life depends
on your answer.

Answer me!

You needn't

This is all very
strange to me, Franz.

164
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,833
Why is it that you can't
love Mademoiselle Valentine?

165
00:11:23,916 --> 00:11:25,666
She's your fiancé.

166
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:27,833
Yeah, and what about you?

167
00:11:27,916 --> 00:11:30,375
Will you stop loving her just
because you can't marry her?

168
00:11:30,458 --> 00:11:32,083
Well, I, uh...

169
00:11:32,166 --> 00:11:33,916
You can't, can you?

170
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,791
You can't simply
fall out of love...

171
00:11:36,708 --> 00:11:38,125
Even if the
relationship is such that,

172
00:11:38,208 --> 00:11:43,000
you can't marry the person
no matter what you desire.

173
00:11:43,083 --> 00:11:45,833
Are you saying that you
harbor a hopeless love

174
00:11:45,916 --> 00:11:47,875
for someone, too?

175
00:11:47,958 --> 00:11:50,833
Getting married isn't
necessarily the only way

176
00:11:50,916 --> 00:11:53,625
to bring
a person happiness.

177
00:11:53,708 --> 00:11:55,458
Don't you think?

178
00:12:00,916 --> 00:12:02,750
I hadn't thought of that...

179
00:12:02,833 --> 00:12:05,333
Maybe you're right
about that, Franz

180
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,416
Valentine's found
herself a great guy.

181
00:12:12,875 --> 00:12:14,250
[MONTE CRISTO]
Albert.

182
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:15,541
[ALBERT]
Sir?

183
00:12:15,625 --> 00:12:18,458
I realize that this must
seem like an odd request,

184
00:12:18,541 --> 00:12:20,916
but I'd like to know
what you've eaten today.

185
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,125
Actually, I've been
so busy today

186
00:12:23,208 --> 00:12:25,458
I haven't eaten
anything at all.

187
00:12:25,541 --> 00:12:28,541
But you know Sir,
now that you mention it,

188
00:12:28,625 --> 00:12:32,333
I drank some water from the
table with the blue flowers.

189
00:12:33,041 --> 00:12:36,083
The table with blue flowers
was the Villefort family's.

190
00:12:36,166 --> 00:12:37,208
Yes I know.

191
00:12:37,291 --> 00:12:38,708
What's that got
to do with this?

192
00:12:38,791 --> 00:12:41,875
Albert, I would like you
to remain calm and listen.

193
00:12:41,958 --> 00:12:45,208
The thing that's been
attacking your body is a...

194
00:12:45,291 --> 00:12:47,083
...strong poison.

195
00:12:47,166 --> 00:12:48,541
Poison?

196
00:12:48,625 --> 00:12:51,250
That's right, a fearful
poison that comes

197
00:12:51,333 --> 00:12:54,291
from Eastern Space that is
commonly know as "zhen-du."

198
00:12:54,375 --> 00:12:56,541
Are you telling me that
the water was poisoned?

199
00:12:56,625 --> 00:12:58,833
That would be a
safe assumption.

200
00:12:58,916 --> 00:13:01,708
I think you were able to
survive because the ice melted,

201
00:13:01,791 --> 00:13:04,416
thus diluting
the deadly poison.

202
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,083
You had a very
close call.

203
00:13:06,166 --> 00:13:09,208
But who would want do
a thing like that to me?

204
00:13:09,291 --> 00:13:13,708
I suspect that you
were not the target.

205
00:13:13,791 --> 00:13:14,916
Oh, I see.

206
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,208
The poison was mixed
into the water pitcher

207
00:13:17,291 --> 00:13:18,666
that was on the table,

208
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:21,125
which means that the real
target was the Villefort family.

209
00:13:22,416 --> 00:13:24,125
But why would they do that?

210
00:13:24,208 --> 00:13:27,833
Feelings of hatred and
jealousy towards another.

211
00:13:27,916 --> 00:13:32,041
They are emotions which
silently fester and grow,

212
00:13:32,125 --> 00:13:35,000
unbeknownst to the
person who feels them.

213
00:13:35,083 --> 00:13:36,666
The happier that person is,

214
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:39,333
the less aware he
is of these feelings.

215
00:13:39,416 --> 00:13:43,208
However, their attempt at
murder ended in utter failure.

216
00:13:43,291 --> 00:13:45,208
Which means they
will try again.

217
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:46,708
They can't!

218
00:13:46,791 --> 00:13:49,708
The Villeforts are good people
that I care about deeply.

219
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:55,000
Albert what are you doing?

220
00:13:55,083 --> 00:13:57,166
Are you sure you
should be out of bed yet?

221
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:58,333
[ALBERT]
I feel fine now.

222
00:13:58,416 --> 00:13:59,625
Sorry I made you worry.

223
00:13:59,708 --> 00:14:01,000
Still, I really think
that you should try

224
00:14:01,083 --> 00:14:02,541
to take it easy for
awhile.

225
00:14:02,625 --> 00:14:04,625
I must agree with
Franz, Monsieur Albert.

226
00:14:04,708 --> 00:14:06,708
No, we have to hurry.

227
00:14:06,791 --> 00:14:08,166
I'll explain it
all to you later.

228
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:10,583
But right now we have to get
over to Valentine's house.

229
00:14:10,666 --> 00:14:13,458
To Mademoiselle
Valentine's house?

230
00:14:13,541 --> 00:14:15,208
Yeah.

231
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:24,083
[HELOISE] You're such
a frightening man...

232
00:14:24,541 --> 00:14:29,833
At the same time you
are very, very alluring...

233
00:14:50,833 --> 00:14:53,083
[VILLEFORT] Are we
clear on this, Boville?

234
00:14:53,166 --> 00:14:55,125
Use every network
at your disposal

235
00:14:55,208 --> 00:14:57,666
and find out everything
there is to know about him.

236
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:59,875
I believe he comes
from Marseilles.

237
00:14:59,958 --> 00:15:01,625
Start the
investigation there.

238
00:15:01,708 --> 00:15:03,625
[BOVILLE]
Right...

239
00:15:03,708 --> 00:15:06,375
Mark my words,
I'll find out who you are.

240
00:15:06,458 --> 00:15:09,208
Count of Monte Cristo, my ass.

241
00:15:12,375 --> 00:15:15,833
Your honor, please
excuse my curiosity...

242
00:15:15,916 --> 00:15:18,625
but what is your connection
to this mystery man?

243
00:15:18,708 --> 00:15:22,250
That is nothing you need
concern yourself about.

244
00:15:22,333 --> 00:15:23,708
Yes, sir.

245
00:15:23,791 --> 00:15:28,041
But I suggest that you be
mindful of any household rats.

246
00:15:28,125 --> 00:15:30,583
I will be I assure you!

247
00:15:30,666 --> 00:15:32,291
Good.

248
00:15:42,833 --> 00:15:44,250
[VALANTINE]
Look, Grandfather.

249
00:15:44,333 --> 00:15:46,291
Isn't this a beautiful cross?

250
00:15:55,583 --> 00:15:57,250
Pardon me, Mademoiselle...

251
00:15:57,333 --> 00:16:01,166
I thought you might
want something to drink.

252
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:03,166
Thank you, Valois.

253
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:25,166
[FRANZ] Are you sure
about this Albert?

254
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:27,166
Someone's trying to
kill the Villefort family?

255
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:29,958
Don't you think the Count
is reading too much into this?

256
00:16:30,041 --> 00:16:31,416
No, not at all.

257
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:34,583
He's a smart man.
And I believe him.

258
00:16:37,583 --> 00:16:38,875
Franz... Listen to me...

259
00:16:38,958 --> 00:16:40,541
Can I tell you something?

260
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:41,666
It sounds serious.

261
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:43,625
What the matter Albert?

262
00:16:43,708 --> 00:16:47,041
See, the thing is, I think
I finally figured it out.

263
00:16:47,125 --> 00:16:48,583
All right, what is it?

264
00:16:48,666 --> 00:16:51,166
You just might laugh at me
for saying this to you, Franz,

265
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:53,541
but I really do think that
it's important for two people

266
00:16:53,625 --> 00:16:55,750
to love each other
when they're married

267
00:16:55,833 --> 00:16:57,041
What's gotten into you?

268
00:16:57,125 --> 00:16:58,166
What brought this on?

269
00:16:58,250 --> 00:16:59,666
Well, it's...

270
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:01,000
It's just...

271
00:17:01,083 --> 00:17:03,250
It's just that I really want
Valentine and Maximilien

272
00:17:03,333 --> 00:17:05,375
to be happy together.

273
00:17:05,916 --> 00:17:08,541
I know it's more complicated
than that for you.

274
00:17:08,625 --> 00:17:10,708
No it's not complicated.

275
00:17:10,791 --> 00:17:13,000
I want the same thing
with all my heart.

276
00:17:13,083 --> 00:17:15,000
If it's humanly possible,
I think two people

277
00:17:15,083 --> 00:17:17,333
who love each other
should always be together.

278
00:17:17,416 --> 00:17:19,083
You do?

279
00:17:19,791 --> 00:17:21,500
The love those two
have is the real thing.

280
00:17:21,583 --> 00:17:23,541
I want them to be happy.

281
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:28,583
No way is anyone
poisoning her!

282
00:17:31,875 --> 00:17:35,833
The rain certainly seems to have
gotten stronger Mademoiselle...

283
00:17:37,875 --> 00:17:40,625
Whew, it's rather
humid, isn't it?

284
00:17:40,708 --> 00:17:42,000
You must be hot, Valois.

285
00:17:42,083 --> 00:17:43,875
Would you
like a glass, too?

286
00:17:44,416 --> 00:17:47,000
Uh... Oh no,
I couldn't possibly...

287
00:17:47,083 --> 00:17:49,458
It's all right,
don't stand on ceremony.

288
00:17:58,583 --> 00:18:01,333
Oh my! Valois!

289
00:18:02,583 --> 00:18:04,458
Valois, what's
the matter with you?!

290
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:05,833
Speak to me!!

291
00:18:05,916 --> 00:18:08,041
M-Mademoiselle...

292
00:18:08,583 --> 00:18:10,666
Valois?

293
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:13,625
Valois!

294
00:18:13,708 --> 00:18:17,250
Wha... What's wrong?

295
00:18:17,333 --> 00:18:25,208
[VALANTINE crying]

296
00:18:25,291 --> 00:18:27,791
Grandfather what's
happening to me?

297
00:19:00,833 --> 00:19:02,125
Hurry!

298
00:19:02,208 --> 00:19:04,375
Hurry and call the doctor!

299
00:19:06,708 --> 00:19:08,916
Mademoiselle Valentine...!

300
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:13,375
How can this be happening?
Mademoiselle Valentine!

301
00:19:19,416 --> 00:19:20,666
I can't believe it.

302
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:22,833
It's just like the Count said.

303
00:19:23,958 --> 00:19:27,208
I don't understand what
the hell is going on here!

304
00:19:29,166 --> 00:19:31,291
Just wait here.
I'll be right back.

305
00:19:31,375 --> 00:19:32,083
Where are you going?

306
00:19:32,166 --> 00:19:33,541
Where else?

307
00:19:33,625 --> 00:19:35,250
To go over and talk to the
Count about what's going on.

308
00:19:35,333 --> 00:19:37,041
He might be able to do
something to help her!

309
00:19:37,125 --> 00:19:38,125
Like he helped me!

310
00:19:38,208 --> 00:19:40,750
Hey wait! Albert!

311
00:19:43,666 --> 00:19:45,541
Oh, Albert...

312
00:19:46,708 --> 00:19:51,000
Of course, I'll be at your side
wherever you go, Gankutsuou.

313
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,833
Monsieur,
His Excellency is away

314
00:19:58,916 --> 00:20:00,625
on a business trip
at the moment.

315
00:20:00,708 --> 00:20:01,416
Sorry.

316
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:02,541
You've got to be kidding!

317
00:20:02,625 --> 00:20:04,000
When will he be back?

318
00:20:04,083 --> 00:20:07,208
I am afraid that is
entirely up to His Excellency.

319
00:20:07,291 --> 00:20:10,250
I'm sorry I cannot
be of more help.

320
00:20:15,791 --> 00:20:17,541
Well, well, I see
that as always

321
00:20:17,625 --> 00:20:20,750
you are completely helpless
when you're all by yourself.

322
00:20:20,833 --> 00:20:22,166
You!

323
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:25,833
I'm looking forward to
seeing how this all turns out.

324
00:20:25,916 --> 00:20:27,750
And what does that mean?

325
00:20:28,666 --> 00:20:32,125
Do you have the courage to
learn what the future holds?

326
00:20:34,125 --> 00:20:36,833
I don't understand.
Who are you?

327
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:53,166
Damn it! What am
I supposed to do now?!

328
00:21:10,708 --> 00:21:13,916
Don't die, Please
don't die Valentine!

329
00:21:15,541 --> 00:21:19,458
You child of illicit love who
has awoken from a dark dream...

330
00:21:19,541 --> 00:21:23,083
...and come back to life
from the depths of death...

331
00:21:23,166 --> 00:21:27,291
You beautiful child who
knows nothing of love,

332
00:21:27,375 --> 00:21:29,541
nor of being loved.

333
00:21:31,666 --> 00:21:34,000
Thou art anathema.

334
00:21:36,375 --> 00:21:38,791
Thou art anathema!

335
00:23:28,791 --> 00:23:30,041
[ALBERT] A dark
cloud spreads out

336
00:23:30,125 --> 00:23:31,708
like a stain to cover our lives.

337
00:23:31,791 --> 00:23:33,458
And a letter arrives
from an old friend

338
00:23:33,541 --> 00:23:35,166
who was thought to be dead.

339
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:38,666
Next Gankutsuou,
The Count of Monte Cristo,

340
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:40,083
Act 10: "The Letter
From Edmond."

341
00:23:40,166 --> 00:23:42,083
Bide your time,
and hold out hope!
