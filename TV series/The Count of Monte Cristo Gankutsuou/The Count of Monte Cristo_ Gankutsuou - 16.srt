friend of Monsieur Villefort's.

They were both from Marseilles.

as Mondego was
erased from existence,

00:09:26,208 --> 00:09:27,208
Wait a minute!

160
00:09:27,291 --> 00:09:28,708
What're you two
trying to say to me?!

161
00:09:28,791 --> 00:09:31,208
That my father is the same
man as that monster, Mondego?!

162
00:09:31,291 --> 00:09:34,166
You get your kicks by publishing
made up stories about people?

163
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:35,541
[BEAUCHAMP]
Oh please!

164
00:09:35,625 --> 00:09:38,708
You seriously think I wrote
a made up story for fun?

165
00:09:38,791 --> 00:09:41,041
I mean, do you have
any clue what it did

166
00:09:41,125 --> 00:09:43,166
to me to have to research
and write that piece?

167
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:45,750
Do you really think that I'm
some sort of sleazy slime ball

168
00:09:45,833 --> 00:09:48,000
who would sell out his
friends just for a scoop?!

169
00:09:48,083 --> 00:09:49,375
That's enough.

170
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,541
Look. Albert...
I'm a journalist, okay?

171
00:09:53,625 --> 00:09:56,250
I have a solemn duty to get
the truth out to the people,

172
00:09:56,333 --> 00:09:59,000
no matter what the cost may be.

173
00:10:05,708 --> 00:10:07,791
[ALBERT]
Dammit!

174
00:10:09,458 --> 00:10:12,166
[FRANZ] The immortal man
from Chateau d'If...

175
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:13,583
Gankutsuou...

176
00:10:13,666 --> 00:10:15,125
The strange mark that I saw

177
00:10:15,208 --> 00:10:18,416
on the Count's forehead back
on that night in Auteuil was...

178
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:22,041
...was definitely
the mark of Gankutsuou.

179
00:10:22,125 --> 00:10:25,541
Does that mean that the Count
has turned into Gankutsuou?

180
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:28,625
What's he doing in Paris?

181
00:10:28,708 --> 00:10:30,333
[MAXIMILIEN] If you keep
pushing yourself this hard,

182
00:10:30,416 --> 00:10:32,125
you're gonna
make yourself sick

183
00:10:32,208 --> 00:10:34,791
You didn't stay up all
night again, did you?

184
00:10:34,875 --> 00:10:37,916
You're such a worrywart,
you do know that?

185
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,333
Please, eat.

186
00:10:39,416 --> 00:10:41,708
It's just country food,
but it'll keep you nourished.

187
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:43,791
Hey, that looks great...

188
00:10:43,875 --> 00:10:45,416
Thanks a lot.

189
00:10:47,291 --> 00:10:48,666
Go on, take it to him.

190
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:49,833
No can't!

191
00:10:49,916 --> 00:10:51,250
I'm too embarrassed!

192
00:10:51,333 --> 00:10:52,750
Aw come on, you were the one

193
00:10:52,833 --> 00:10:54,625
who said that youwanted
to meet Franz, weren't you?

194
00:10:54,708 --> 00:10:56,708
[GIRL] Well then, you come
in with me, big brother.

195
00:10:56,791 --> 00:10:58,375
What are you two up to out here?

196
00:10:58,458 --> 00:10:59,666
Hey, Maximillien!

197
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:02,833
Um... Uh...

198
00:11:02,916 --> 00:11:04,541
Come on in.

199
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:09,166
[GIRL]
Here! Eat this!

200
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:11,541
[BOY] She said you looked
like you were in the dumps,

201
00:11:11,625 --> 00:11:14,291
so we made these
cookies for you.

202
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:18,875
Thanks, you two.

203
00:11:26,375 --> 00:11:27,375
[BOTH giggling]

204
00:11:27,458 --> 00:11:28,833
[MAXIMILIEN]
You two...

205
00:11:56,583 --> 00:11:58,791
[VILLEFORT] Mark my words!
You're going to be next!

206
00:11:58,875 --> 00:12:01,958
Disaster will come
calling at your house!

207
00:12:06,666 --> 00:12:07,833
[FRANZ]
It feels strange.

208
00:12:07,916 --> 00:12:09,083
[MAXIMILIEN]
Huh?

209
00:12:09,166 --> 00:12:10,500
[FRANZ] For there to be
so many family members

210
00:12:10,583 --> 00:12:12,000
in the same house.

211
00:12:12,083 --> 00:12:13,500
[MAXIMILIEN] But aren't there
a great many people living

212
00:12:13,583 --> 00:12:14,958
in your own house, Monsieur?

213
00:12:15,041 --> 00:12:16,416
[FRANZ]
Yes, years ago.

214
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,208
Lots of servants
lived there too.

215
00:12:18,291 --> 00:12:20,125
But now, there are
just a few servants left

216
00:12:20,208 --> 00:12:21,666
and my mother, of course.

217
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:23,541
[MAXIMILIEN]
Sorry, I didn't realize...

218
00:12:23,625 --> 00:12:26,208
[FRANZ] There are a lot of
different kinds of aristocrats.

219
00:12:26,291 --> 00:12:28,583
For instance, the engagement
between Valantine and I

220
00:12:28,666 --> 00:12:30,625
was forced on us
by Monsieur Villefort,

221
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:32,791
because my family has
been known for generations

222
00:12:32,875 --> 00:12:34,916
in Paris as staunch royalists.

223
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,291
Unlike Albert's family, mine
has not amassed a large fortune,

224
00:12:38,375 --> 00:12:39,791
so we thought it
really wouldn't hurt

225
00:12:39,875 --> 00:12:41,375
to have some well
connected backing

226
00:12:41,458 --> 00:12:44,458
once I started to make my way
into diplomatic community.

227
00:12:44,541 --> 00:12:45,875
[MAXIMILIEN]
I'm sorry.

228
00:12:45,958 --> 00:12:48,583
I said all those things
without knowing the truth.

229
00:12:49,583 --> 00:12:50,750
[FRANZ]
Hey, I'm not so dumb

230
00:12:50,833 --> 00:12:52,458
that I need you
to worry about me.

231
00:12:52,541 --> 00:12:53,958
You'd never guess
by looking at me,

232
00:12:54,041 --> 00:12:56,208
but I hit the books hard.

233
00:12:56,291 --> 00:13:03,250
[BOTH laughing]

234
00:13:03,333 --> 00:13:05,041
[FRANZ]
Monsieur Noirtier was right.

235
00:13:05,125 --> 00:13:07,750
He said that he wanted
you to make Valantine happy.

236
00:13:07,833 --> 00:13:09,875
I think that maybe
you're the only one I know

237
00:13:09,958 --> 00:13:11,583
who can actually do that.

238
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:13,541
[MAXIMILIEN]
I will!

239
00:13:22,833 --> 00:13:24,666
[FRANZ]
Who is this?

240
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:27,375
[MAXIMILIEN] My father. He
passed away three years ago.

241
00:13:27,458 --> 00:13:29,625
[FRANZ] That's quite a
beautiful ship he's got there.

242
00:13:29,708 --> 00:13:31,625
[MAXIMILIEN]
She was called the Pharaon.

243
00:13:31,708 --> 00:13:33,625
She was the crowning
star of our fleet.

244
00:13:33,708 --> 00:13:35,958
She's changed hands now, though.

245
00:13:39,666 --> 00:13:41,541
[FRANZ]
Edmond Dantes?

246
00:13:41,625 --> 00:13:42,666
[MAXIMILIEN]
Oh, Edmond?

247
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:44,958
Don't tell me you
know Edmond Dantes.

248
00:13:45,041 --> 00:13:47,333
[FRANZ] No, do you?
Do you know who he is?

249
00:13:47,416 --> 00:13:49,541
[MAXIMILIEN]
Yes, of course.

250
00:13:49,625 --> 00:13:53,625
He worked as first mate for
Morrel and Son, some time ago.

251
00:14:04,083 --> 00:14:04,875
[ALBERT]
No go...

252
00:14:04,958 --> 00:14:06,375
With that circus out there,

253
00:14:06,458 --> 00:14:09,250
I'll never make it to the
back door let alone the front.

254
00:14:09,333 --> 00:14:10,458
[ALBERT gasps]

255
00:14:11,375 --> 00:14:13,250
[PEPPO]
Come on, this way!

256
00:14:14,708 --> 00:14:16,625
[PEPPO]
Over here.

257
00:14:16,708 --> 00:14:18,291
It's the one gate
in the mansion

258
00:14:18,375 --> 00:14:19,916
that isn't hooked into
the security system.

259
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,416
[ALBERT] I don't get it.
How do you know all this stuff?

260
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:25,583
Hey, uh, Peppo?

261
00:14:25,666 --> 00:14:29,166
[PEPPO] Get a move on.
The paparazzi'll be here soon!

262
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:31,416
[ALBERT]
I owe you one.

263
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:39,500
Goodbye, Albert.
I'm going to miss you.

264
00:14:39,583 --> 00:14:41,000
[REPORTER D] Hey, there's
somebody over there!

265
00:14:41,083 --> 00:14:42,833
[REPORTER E]
C'mon, let's go!

266
00:14:42,916 --> 00:14:45,250
[ALBERT]
Mother! Are you here?!

267
00:14:46,125 --> 00:14:48,333
Mother!

268
00:14:48,416 --> 00:14:50,666
Mother, aren't you home?

269
00:14:59,916 --> 00:15:01,750
There you are!

270
00:15:06,791 --> 00:15:07,916
Oh, Albert...

271
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:08,708
Mother!

272
00:15:08,791 --> 00:15:10,416
I'm so happy you're okay.

273
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:12,416
[MERCEDES]
Oh, thank goodness you're safe.

274
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:14,000
Thank goodness...

275
00:15:14,083 --> 00:15:15,833
Mother, I, I don't...

276
00:15:15,916 --> 00:15:18,000
You're looking awfully
haggard, Albert...

277
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:20,583
I bet you haven't eaten at all.

278
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:22,416
[MERCEDES]
Wait here.

279
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,500
I'll have someone
fix something up for you.

280
00:15:24,583 --> 00:15:25,833
Stop it, Mother.

281
00:15:25,916 --> 00:15:27,625
Stop pretending
that nothing's wrong.

282
00:15:27,708 --> 00:15:29,833
I'm just sick and tired
of everybody treating me

283
00:15:29,916 --> 00:15:32,666
like I'm some kind
of clueless kid!

284
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:36,083
[ALBERT] I just don't want
to hear any more lies.

285
00:15:40,458 --> 00:15:44,708
[MERCEDES] Your father and I
are not true aristocrats.

286
00:15:45,291 --> 00:15:47,500
We were both commoners
born in a small village

287
00:15:47,583 --> 00:15:50,416
just outside of
Marseilles called Catalonia.

288
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,208
But how...

289
00:15:54,083 --> 00:15:58,166
What is Father's real name?

290
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:00,833
Your father's real name is...

291
00:16:00,916 --> 00:16:03,958
...Fernand Mondego.

292
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:07,041
[MERCEDES] By the time I
realized what was happening,

293
00:16:07,125 --> 00:16:08,750
it was already too late.

294
00:16:08,833 --> 00:16:10,583
Once I said we were
born aristocrats,

295
00:16:10,666 --> 00:16:13,500
I had no choice but
to keep playing the part.

296
00:16:13,583 --> 00:16:15,041
But the truth finally came out

297
00:16:15,125 --> 00:16:17,666
in the middle of your
father's campaign speech.

298
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:19,208
I don't get it!

299
00:16:19,291 --> 00:16:21,333
Mother why are you saying all
these terrible things, too?!

300
00:16:21,416 --> 00:16:24,583
I don't understand why you
don't have any faith in Father?!

301
00:16:24,666 --> 00:16:26,083
I heard the speech.

302
00:16:26,166 --> 00:16:27,708
The terrible one
given by the Princess

303
00:16:27,791 --> 00:16:30,833
from Janina that
day with my own ears.

304
00:16:30,916 --> 00:16:32,666
If I had sensed
even for an instant

305
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:35,166
that any one of her
words were mere lies,

306
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:36,833
I would have passed
judgment over her

307
00:16:36,916 --> 00:16:39,125
in Heaven's stead
then and there.

308
00:16:39,208 --> 00:16:41,333
But it was all true.

309
00:16:42,791 --> 00:16:43,958
[MERCEDES]
Albert...

310
00:16:44,041 --> 00:16:46,375
We each must face the
inevitable consequences

311
00:16:46,458 --> 00:16:48,583
of the things we have done.

312
00:16:48,666 --> 00:16:52,250
We must never again avert
our eyes from the truth.

313
00:17:01,375 --> 00:17:04,416
[ALBERT] Haidee wanted this to
happen from the very beginning!

314
00:17:05,416 --> 00:17:07,625
Damn it! Damn it!

315
00:17:07,708 --> 00:17:09,875
[MAXIMILIEN] Every year, my
father and I would go together

316
00:17:09,958 --> 00:17:13,333
to place flowers on the
grave of Edmond Dantes.

317
00:17:14,625 --> 00:17:16,791
Father would always
stare out at the sea,

318
00:17:16,875 --> 00:17:20,791
and he would never tell me much
about Edmond or the life he led.

319
00:17:20,875 --> 00:17:23,875
But then on his deathbed,
he kept calling out his name,

320
00:17:23,958 --> 00:17:26,708
with tears flowing
down from his eyes.

321
00:17:26,791 --> 00:17:29,541
"I want to see Edmond!
I want to see Edmond!"

322
00:17:29,625 --> 00:17:34,541
"Oh why wasn't I able to
save my friend Edmond?! Why?"

323
00:17:34,625 --> 00:17:39,916
Please, Maximilien, show me
Morrel &amp; Son's crew roster.

324
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,416
[MAXIMILIEN] I haven't seen
many of the records

325
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,708
that date back
to my father's time.

326
00:17:44,791 --> 00:17:47,291
Edmond... Edmond...

327
00:17:47,375 --> 00:17:49,083
This is him!

328
00:17:50,208 --> 00:17:52,833
[FRANZ] It can't be. His face
is completely different.

329
00:17:52,916 --> 00:17:53,875
But still...

330
00:17:53,958 --> 00:17:55,916
[MAXIMILIEN]
What, monsieur? Tell me.

331
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,541
Well, the name of Edmond Dantes

332
00:17:57,625 --> 00:17:59,791
was in Monsieur
Noirtier's memories.

333
00:17:59,875 --> 00:18:02,416
25 years ago,
he was sent to prison

334
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:05,833
for a crime Monsieur Noitier
said he didn't commit.

335
00:18:09,166 --> 00:18:10,750
[FRANZ gasps]
What the--

336
00:18:10,833 --> 00:18:15,000
[FRANZ] Baron Danglars?!
Danglars was the ship's purser?

337
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:32,750
That's it! So that's
what this is all about!

338
00:18:33,708 --> 00:18:36,416
[FRANZ] I have to get back
there! Albert is in danger.

339
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:37,666
[MAXIMILIEN]
I don't get it.

340
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:39,708
What in the world is the matter?

341
00:18:40,125 --> 00:18:41,291
He's still alive!

342
00:18:41,375 --> 00:18:42,625
Huh?

343
00:18:42,708 --> 00:18:46,708
I'm sure Edmond Dantes is alive!

344
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,875
[ALBERT]
Haidee!

345
00:18:50,958 --> 00:18:53,791
Get out here! Haidee!

346
00:18:53,875 --> 00:18:56,333
Show yourself right now!

347
00:18:56,416 --> 00:18:59,875
Haidee!

348
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:06,666
[ALBERT panting]

349
00:19:18,416 --> 00:19:20,208
Long time, no see, little boy.

350
00:19:20,291 --> 00:19:23,125
Not since back on Luna, right?

351
00:19:23,208 --> 00:19:26,125
Luigi Vampa?

352
00:19:26,208 --> 00:19:29,000
[ALBERT] What are you
doing in the Count's home?

353
00:19:29,541 --> 00:19:32,250
What are you doing,
he says. That's rich.

354
00:19:32,333 --> 00:19:35,125
[TERESA] The boy's still
as naive as ever.

355
00:19:35,208 --> 00:19:38,166
Why don't you go ahead
and explain it to him.

356
00:19:46,166 --> 00:19:50,250
[ALBERT] But you said that you'd
left the bandit gang, Peppo!

357
00:19:50,333 --> 00:19:52,333
The truth is I've been
keeping an eye on you

358
00:19:52,416 --> 00:19:55,583
on orders from
the Count, Albert.

359
00:19:55,958 --> 00:19:57,916
[PEPPO] I've also been
sending detailed reports

360
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,583
of all your movements to
the Count since I arrived.

361
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:12,000
But Why would the
Count have you do that?

362
00:20:12,083 --> 00:20:14,666
Please, you must have
a vague idea by now.

363
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:16,041
About why the Count made friends

364
00:20:16,125 --> 00:20:20,000
with you up on Luna,
and then came to Paris.

365
00:20:21,458 --> 00:20:23,375
Shut up! Where is Haidee?!

366
00:20:23,458 --> 00:20:25,958
Hurry up and send her out!

367
00:20:28,625 --> 00:20:32,208
His servants have
left the mansion.

368
00:20:33,166 --> 00:20:37,041
[LUIGI] Their master is due to
arrive on Earth any time now.

369
00:20:46,458 --> 00:20:48,083
[FRANZ]
General Morcerf...

370
00:20:48,166 --> 00:20:50,083
The Scandal of Janina...

371
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:53,000
You're making your
move Count. Aren't you?

372
00:20:54,166 --> 00:20:56,958
Oh Albert, please stay safe.

373
00:21:12,708 --> 00:21:14,791
Haidee, there you are!

374
00:23:28,958 --> 00:23:30,750
[ALBERT]
Count, you have to tell me.

375
00:23:30,833 --> 00:23:32,750
Where can I find hope?

376
00:23:32,833 --> 00:23:34,625
Where is the truth you spoke of?

377
00:23:34,708 --> 00:23:37,875
Next Gankutsuou, The Count
of Monte Cristo, Act 17:

378
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:39,041
"The Confession".

379
00:23:39,125 --> 00:23:41,250
Bide your time,
and hold out hope!
