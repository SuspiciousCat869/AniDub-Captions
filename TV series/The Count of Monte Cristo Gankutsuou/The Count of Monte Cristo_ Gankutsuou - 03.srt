fascinating and beautiful.

Thanks to this power the boy

00:01:53,125 --> 00:01:56,166
was able to escape
the bandits' clutches.

00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,083
And yet, my friend said to me,

00:01:58,166 --> 00:02:01,500
"there is nothing so inconstant
as the human heart."

Albert! Come on!!

Time to wake up!

[EUGENIE] I can't believe
you were still in bed.

13
00:03:15,083 --> 00:03:17,166
I have an important
visitor arriving today

14
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:19,000
and I've been really
busy getting ready.

You didn't have to come
if you didn't want to.

[EUGENIE]
Who's the visitor?

17
00:03:23,708 --> 00:03:25,500
[ALBERT] Someone who
did me a favor on Luna.

18
00:03:25,583 --> 00:03:26,833
Oh, I see, now.

19

It's that fake Count
something-or-other, right?

You haven't even met him!

How do you know he's fake!!

22
00:03:31,833 --> 00:03:34,166
Oh, Speaking of visitors,
Chateau-Renaud said

23
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:36,291
that he's bringing
someone with him.

Why are you smirking?

You know, Albert, you've got
to be the most perfect target

for a con artist in
the whole of Paris.

[ALBERT] What're
you angry about?

[EUGENIE]
I'm angry?

00:04:12,625 --> 00:04:14,708
I thought I was just
enjoying our drive.

We're not in a

Behind the wheel and in life.

38
00:04:27,041 --> 00:04:28,958
My life is none of your
business, all right?

39
00:04:29,041 --> 00:04:30,041
Get out! Now!!

40
00:04:30,125 --> 00:04:31,375
Sure, I'll get out.

I don't want to
ride with you, anyway!

We're already here.

You know, for
the life of me,

I can't figure out why
you and I are still engaged!

Hey!

Hi Maximilian!
I'm sorry I'm late!

77
00:06:12,458 --> 00:06:14,583
[CHATEAU-RENAUD] There I was,
out on a dangerous recon,

78
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:17,375
and suddenly I stumbled
into an enemy nest.

my favorite grenade,

I went as white as a sheet!"

81
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:23,416
From inside the
hole, I could hear

00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:27,125
the Eridanians making eerie
threatening clicking noises.

83
00:06:27,208 --> 00:06:28,583
Anyway, I'm not
one who subscribes

84
00:06:28,666 --> 00:06:32,583

they're a sentient race.

I was done for!

his way onto a battlefield.

So, Captain Morel,
where do you hail from?

105
00:07:21,791 --> 00:07:23,958
My family makes its
home in Marseiiles.

106
00:07:24,041 --> 00:07:26,333
[DEBRAY] That's a
pretty rough place.

107
00:07:26,416 --> 00:07:27,666

And you?

00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:28,958
Paris, of course!

The old town area,
admittedly.

The town of Marseilles...

What sort of a place is it?

112

When I was young,

113
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:39,791
it was a beautiful
harbor town filled

114
00:07:39,875 --> 00:07:41,958
with sightseers and tourists.

115
00:07:42,041 --> 00:07:43,541
[DEBRAY] Well now,
it's not a place that

116
00:07:43,625 --> 00:07:46,750
a lady should even
consider venturing into.

117
00:08:08,125 --> 00:08:10,000
[ALBERT] We haven't climbed
up here in a long time.

look a bit menacing though,

[EUGENIE] Why do you
suppose there's a need

125
00:08:49,333 --> 00:08:52,250
to divide the world up
with city walls and boarders?

The ugliness of the
outside world exists

127
00:08:54,541 --> 00:08:58,166
for the purpose of making the
beauty of our kingdom stand out.

128
00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:00,291
[ALBERT] Well, that may
be so, but I assure you

129
00:09:00,375 --> 00:09:02,875
there's plenty of great
things outside these walls.

130
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:04,333
Don't you think we should try

131
00:09:04,416 --> 00:09:06,333
to open our eyes a little
more and see the real world?

132
00:09:06,416 --> 00:09:08,291
[BEAUCHAMP] Oh, have you
grown up a little now

133

that you're back
from your trip?

134
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,333
[DEBRAY]
I suppose you're right.

135
00:09:11,416 --> 00:09:12,666
So go right ahead
and take on

136
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:15,541
all the troubles that
exist outside the walls.

137
00:09:15,625 --> 00:09:17,208
That should quiet
those stinging pangs

138
00:09:17,291 --> 00:09:20,708
of boredom of yours,
for a little while at least.

139
00:09:20,791 --> 00:09:23,791
Now, this is what
we should be looking at.

The High Court of Justice.
Danglars Bank

And the place where
your father works,

Space Forces Headquarters.

143

The triangle of
Parisian power.

144
00:09:33,708 --> 00:09:35,250
That is the true "great thing"

145
00:09:35,333 --> 00:09:37,666
that we should inherit,
don't you think?

146
00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:44,500
[EUGENIE]
To me, it feels like

147
00:09:44,583 --> 00:09:47,666
we're the ones who
have been sealed in.

[MONTE CRISTO]
I am no longer all alone

150
00:10:02,708 --> 00:10:06,958
wallowing in abject solitude.
For I am now surrounded

151
00:10:07,041 --> 00:10:10,125
by the Furies,
the goddesses of vengeance.

152
00:10:10,208 --> 00:10:13,125
In the cold bosom
of the darkness...

153
00:10:13,208 --> 00:10:15,333
I awaited the dawn.

154
00:10:15,416 --> 00:10:17,083
And once dawn came,

155
00:10:17,166 --> 00:10:20,583
I cursed my flesh until
night fell once more.

156

I even prayed that
I would lose my sanity.

But those prayers
went unheeded.

Nothing changed...

159
00:10:29,208 --> 00:10:30,625
And when I strove for

grabbed hold and held me back.

162
00:10:37,583 --> 00:10:41,125
Well... It won't be long now...

163
00:10:53,625 --> 00:10:56,500
[DEBRAY] Boy, what
a terrible drive that was...

164
00:10:56,583 --> 00:11:00,250
Maybe it was punishment for
skipping the Cabinet meeting...

165
00:11:00,333 --> 00:11:01,458
[BEAUCHAMP]
Have candidates for the next

166
00:11:01,541 --> 00:11:02,875
President
been chosen yet?

167
00:11:02,958 --> 00:11:04,250
The word on the street is

168
00:11:04,333 --> 00:11:06,458
that His Excellency Morcerf
is the front runner.

169
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:07,916
You must've heard a few things

170
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,875
from your father,
haven't you, Albert?

171
00:11:09,958 --> 00:11:11,125
You know, you should really

172
00:11:11,208 --> 00:11:13,375
watch your step around
Beauchamp, Maximilian.

173
00:11:13,458 --> 00:11:14,958
He's a terrible man who will use

174
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:17,791
even his friends' scandals
as fodder for articles.

175
00:11:17,875 --> 00:11:20,541
That's what they call
"impartial journalism."

176
00:11:20,625 --> 00:11:22,791
[MAXIMILIAN] I read your
articles all the time.

177
00:11:22,875 --> 00:11:25,208
But I do not approve
of the content.

178
00:11:25,291 --> 00:11:27,750
I get that all the time.

179
00:11:31,333 --> 00:11:32,541
[DEBRAY]
Where are the ladies?

180
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:33,750
[ALBERT] They went home,

181
00:11:33,833 --> 00:11:35,166
because their dresses
were totally soaked.

182
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:37,041
[FRANZ] Chateau Renaud's
antique, too.

183
00:11:37,125 --> 00:11:38,041
If they'd said something,

184
00:11:38,125 --> 00:11:39,500
I would have given
them a lift home.

185
00:11:39,583 --> 00:11:42,000
That'd be just like
tossing food to a monkey.

186
00:11:42,083 --> 00:11:43,500
Hm!

187
00:11:44,791 --> 00:11:47,791
[DEBRAY] So, the
Count of Monte Cristo?

188
00:11:47,875 --> 00:11:49,333
[BEAUCHAMP] I can't
say I've heard of him.

189
00:11:49,416 --> 00:11:52,333
There's nothing on him
at the Cabinet Secretariat.

190
00:11:52,416 --> 00:11:54,291
Probably an
alias. Or...

191
00:11:54,375 --> 00:11:56,166
A pretender or a con man?

192
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:58,041
I'll thank you to
refrain from idle gossip

193
00:11:58,125 --> 00:12:00,666
about an honored guest
of the Morcerf home.

194
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:02,166
Where'd you say
that you ran into

195
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:04,208
this "honored guest"
of yours, again?

196
00:12:04,291 --> 00:12:07,166
At Luna's Carnival when
we were there last spring.

197
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:09,000
Apparently, the honored
son of the family

198
00:12:09,083 --> 00:12:10,708
was abducted by bandits.

199
00:12:10,791 --> 00:12:12,250
Now that's too funny.

200
00:12:12,333 --> 00:12:16,208
So Albert, were you seduced
by one of Luna's wily vixens?

201
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,791
[ALBERT coughs]

202
00:12:22,625 --> 00:12:26,125
Oh, damn it to hell...

203
00:12:27,041 --> 00:12:30,333
[horses galloping]

204
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:32,666
And then the Count came in,

205
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:35,125
and rescued me before the
kidnappers could kill me.

206
00:12:35,208 --> 00:12:38,458
I suppose that you really do owe
your life to the Count, then.

207
00:12:38,541 --> 00:12:40,541
It's clear that
he's kind as well as

208
00:12:40,625 --> 00:12:43,041
incredibly wealthy and
probably well connected.

209
00:12:43,125 --> 00:12:44,666
And what about
the distinct possibility

210
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:48,041
that this millionaire's pouch
was full of forged bills?

211
00:12:48,125 --> 00:12:49,125
Look at this!

212
00:12:49,208 --> 00:12:50,666
If he didn't come
from noble birth,

213
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:53,958
do ya think he would have a
watch as beautiful as this one?

214
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:56,791
When con artists are setting
up a trap in order to win

215
00:12:56,875 --> 00:12:59,791
people's trust, they often
use trinkets just like that.

216
00:12:59,875 --> 00:13:01,375
He's not a con artist!

217
00:13:01,458 --> 00:13:04,125
He commands an
enormous spaceship...

218
00:13:04,208 --> 00:13:05,416
...and he travels with aliens

219
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,833
and a beautiful woman
from Eastern Space.

220
00:13:07,916 --> 00:13:11,250
He's free from the rule of any
government, and he mingles

221
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:14,333
freely with people of all
classes and walks of life.

222
00:13:14,416 --> 00:13:17,458
In everything he does, he breaks
with established tradition.

223
00:13:17,541 --> 00:13:20,333
That's right, and then,
once night falls,

224
00:13:20,416 --> 00:13:21,791
he wanders the darkness

225
00:13:21,875 --> 00:13:24,041
in search of the
lifeblood of maidens.

226
00:13:24,125 --> 00:13:26,750
Yeah, well It wouldn't
surprise me one bit if he did.

227
00:13:26,833 --> 00:13:28,958
The Count has a dark
and ruthless side to him

228
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:31,125
that doesn't seem to care
at all about human life.

229
00:13:31,208 --> 00:13:32,708
Shut up Franz!

230
00:13:42,291 --> 00:13:44,208
Albert! Just calm down!

231
00:13:45,333 --> 00:13:47,208
Hey wait, there was
a case of a sailor

232
00:13:47,291 --> 00:13:49,416
who contracted a local
disease on some planet,

233
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,500
and went around
sucking all the blood

234
00:13:51,583 --> 00:13:53,041
he could find, wasn't there?

235
00:13:53,125 --> 00:13:55,166
You know, you should
be careful, Albert.

236
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:56,875
I hear they enjoy the
blood of virgin boys

237
00:13:56,958 --> 00:13:58,375
almost as much as girls.

238
00:13:58,458 --> 00:14:00,583
So, you think he's
a vampire or something?

239
00:14:00,666 --> 00:14:03,250
It's a lot more plausible
than Lunar bandits.

240
00:14:03,333 --> 00:14:05,833
Yeah, or kindhearted
rich people.

I beg your pardon.

248

But the door was
open so I just entered.

249
00:14:57,875 --> 00:14:59,791
[ALBERT] It's an honor
to see you again.

250
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:03,666
The honor is mine...
Viscount Morcerf.

251
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:06,041
Please sir, I preferred
you called me Albert.

252
00:15:06,125 --> 00:15:09,250
Surely you and I are well
beyond those formalities by now.

253
00:15:09,333 --> 00:15:12,708
As promised, allow me to
introduce you to my friends.

254
00:15:12,791 --> 00:15:15,166
You already know Franz.

255
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:17,541
This is Lucien Debray.

256
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:18,958
He is a shrewd civil servant,

257
00:15:19,041 --> 00:15:22,541
who already holds a key position
in the Interior Ministry

258
00:15:22,625 --> 00:15:23,833
This is Beauchamp.

259
00:15:23,916 --> 00:15:25,583
He's a newspaper reporter.

260
00:15:25,666 --> 00:15:28,250
He can tell you anything you
might want to know about Paris.

261
00:15:28,333 --> 00:15:29,833
It's not a mainstream paper.

262
00:15:29,916 --> 00:15:32,166
It's more of a
third rate gossip sheet.

263
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:34,416
That is most fascinating.

264
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,916
This is Cavalry Captain
Maximilian Morrel,

265
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,500
he's a big hero of
the Eridanus campaign.

266
00:15:39,583 --> 00:15:41,125
Nice to meet you, sir.

267
00:15:41,208 --> 00:15:45,083
Ah, the very paragon of
a faithful, brave soldier

268
00:15:45,166 --> 00:15:47,750
Oh you know Captain Morrel,
Your Excellency?

269
00:15:47,833 --> 00:15:49,250
Not at all.

270
00:15:49,333 --> 00:15:50,791
Count, we've heard
that you've come to us

271
00:15:50,875 --> 00:15:52,875
from somewhere very far away.

272
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:54,666
You're trying to
interview him already?

273
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:56,000
Don't annoy our guest.

274
00:15:56,083 --> 00:16:00,625
Look, I'm just doing
my job, okay?

275
00:16:00,708 --> 00:16:02,250
On many worlds,
the taking of photographs

276
00:16:02,333 --> 00:16:05,500
is seen as a vile and
reprehensible custom.

277
00:16:05,583 --> 00:16:07,625
I must ask you to abstain.

278
00:16:07,708 --> 00:16:08,375
Oh, sorry.

279
00:16:08,458 --> 00:16:09,666
I didn't know...

280
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:11,208
In the course of visiting
many foreign worlds

281
00:16:11,291 --> 00:16:12,833
when I was a sailor...

282
00:16:12,916 --> 00:16:14,041
...I've become
thoroughly tainted

283
00:16:14,125 --> 00:16:16,791
by the diverse customs
of other cultures.

284
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:20,041
I'm afraid that I must seem like
quite the uncivilized savage

285
00:16:20,125 --> 00:16:21,916
to the good people of Paris.

286
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,375
So, what sorts of
places have you been, sir?

287
00:16:24,458 --> 00:16:27,291
I have traveled
to many, many places.

288
00:16:27,375 --> 00:16:30,041
To Eastern Space.
To Northern Space.

289
00:16:30,125 --> 00:16:33,083
Even to the very
core of the galaxy.

290
00:16:33,166 --> 00:16:34,666
And what about the Imperium?

291
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:38,791
Of course. To a sailor, there
are no such things as borders.

292
00:16:38,875 --> 00:16:41,916
But couldn't that be considered
treason against the state, sir?

293
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,083
I see no reason
to swear loyalty to people

294
00:16:44,166 --> 00:16:47,166
who will not extend
their hands to protect me.

295
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:49,041
Would you not
agree with that, sir?

296
00:16:49,125 --> 00:16:52,208
I agree that you posses
rather bold opinions.

297
00:16:52,291 --> 00:16:53,875
Yes, true enough.

298
00:16:53,958 --> 00:16:56,291
I suggest that you
experience being cast out

299
00:16:56,375 --> 00:16:59,500
into the vast universe
all alone as I did.

300
00:16:59,583 --> 00:17:00,875
You would soon see

301
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:04,041
that the only one you
can count upon is yourself.

302
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:10,541
Set the table for tea at once.

303
00:17:15,041 --> 00:17:17,500
So where do you hail from, sir?

304
00:17:17,583 --> 00:17:19,041
I came into this universe

305
00:17:19,125 --> 00:17:22,500
from a distant land that is
far beyond your imagination.

306
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:26,750
[FRANZ] Oh a place that you'd
rather we didn't know about?

307
00:17:28,916 --> 00:17:30,416
Franz! Don't be rude!

308
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:31,833
If we're going to be associating

309
00:17:31,916 --> 00:17:34,041
with the Count as friends,
shouldn't we at least know

310
00:17:34,125 --> 00:17:35,291
where the man comes from?

311
00:17:35,375 --> 00:17:36,833
That's quite understandable.

312
00:17:36,916 --> 00:17:38,541
The very reason why
distinguished gentlemen

313
00:17:38,625 --> 00:17:40,000
such as yourselves
are interested

314
00:17:40,083 --> 00:17:42,041
in what I do or
say is because of the air

315
00:17:42,125 --> 00:17:44,625
of mystery
surrounding me, is it not?

316
00:17:44,708 --> 00:17:46,125
Were that not the case,

317
00:17:46,208 --> 00:17:49,083
surely a rustic aristocrat
from the frontiers of space...

318
00:17:49,166 --> 00:17:52,000
would not have been
given a seat at your table.

319
00:17:53,791 --> 00:17:55,416
[MONTE CRISTO laughs]

320
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,041
Well, you do have us there.

321
00:17:57,125 --> 00:17:59,500
But that's exactly why my
friends and I want to know

322
00:17:59,583 --> 00:18:01,583
more about you
and your background!

323
00:18:01,666 --> 00:18:03,791
Naive as ever, I see.

324
00:18:06,791 --> 00:18:07,708
Peppo!

325
00:18:07,791 --> 00:18:09,166
Is something
the matter, Albert?

326
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:10,250
Huh?

327
00:18:10,333 --> 00:18:12,083
Um, no. Nothing...

328
00:18:33,833 --> 00:18:35,458
All right,
what are you up to?

329
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:37,625
I wound up here.

330
00:18:37,708 --> 00:18:40,375
After you left
I quit the bandit gang.

331
00:18:40,458 --> 00:18:44,208
So I made my way here to Paris
to see if I could find work.

332
00:18:44,291 --> 00:18:46,500
Okay. But what
are you doing HERE?

333
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:50,625
Why I followed
you here, Albert.

334
00:18:50,708 --> 00:18:51,333
I'm lying!

335
00:18:51,416 --> 00:18:52,583
It's just a coincidence.

336
00:18:52,666 --> 00:18:54,958
There happened to
be an opening, that's all.

337
00:18:55,041 --> 00:18:56,708
I want you to tell
me something, Peppo...

338
00:18:56,791 --> 00:18:57,750
I'm impressed.

339
00:18:57,833 --> 00:19:00,208
You remembered
my name. Albert...

340
00:19:00,291 --> 00:19:02,291
Are you planning
to stay here for good?

341
00:19:02,375 --> 00:19:03,625
Can't I?

342
00:19:03,708 --> 00:19:07,208
Well, it's, how can
I put it to you...?

343
00:19:07,291 --> 00:19:08,625
Look, don't
worry about it.

344
00:19:08,708 --> 00:19:11,375
Let's just agree to keep
each other's secrets, okay?

345
00:19:14,625 --> 00:19:17,500
[DEBRAY] Are you
interested in learning

346
00:19:18,541 --> 00:19:19,666
that man's real identity?
Don't worry about it too much.

347
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:21,125
He's nobody special.

348
00:19:21,208 --> 00:19:22,708
So what shall we do?

349
00:19:22,791 --> 00:19:25,458
I was thinking that we
might all go out to Le Queen?

350
00:19:25,541 --> 00:19:26,333
No thanks.

351
00:19:26,416 --> 00:19:27,666
I think I'm gonna pass on that.

352
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:29,625
I think I'm gonna pass too.

353
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:32,791
What the hell...?

354
00:19:33,791 --> 00:19:36,166
It's the Count of
Monte Cristo's voice...

355
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:38,250
Yeah, so, what's the big deal.

356
00:19:38,333 --> 00:19:41,416
It isn't on the recording.

357
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:43,916
So, what sorts of
places have you been, sir?

358
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,083
I ha... ...eled to
...any, ma... pla...

359
00:19:46,166 --> 00:19:47,666
And what about the Imperium?

00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:48,916
...f cou...

362
00:19:51,875 --> 00:19:52,791
But couldn't that...

363
00:19:52,875 --> 00:19:54,250
It's probably a
small malfunction.

364
00:19:54,333 --> 00:19:56,791
So is this a malfunction, too?

365
00:20:12,291 --> 00:20:14,625
What an absolutely
beautiful woman.

366
00:20:14,708 --> 00:20:17,166
Oh. Thanks.
That's my mother.

367
00:20:18,166 --> 00:20:20,291
She's rather young
in this portrait.

368
00:20:21,416 --> 00:20:24,416
This vista is that of
Marseilles, is it not?

369
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:26,166
She likes
paintings like this.

370
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:29,166
I really don't know why she
chose that place as the setting.

371
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:31,291
It's magnificent.

372
00:20:31,375 --> 00:20:33,916
Actually, my father
hates this painting.

373
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,833
He was going to take
it down and burn it,

374
00:20:35,916 --> 00:20:38,333
but we placated him
by hanging it in my room.

[ALBERT'S MOM]
Edmond...

376
00:20:45,291 --> 00:20:46,625
Is something wrong with it?

377
00:20:46,708 --> 00:20:47,708
Not at all.

378
00:20:47,791 --> 00:20:49,583
I'm afraid it's time
I took my leave...

379
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:51,041
Oh, no please don't go!

380
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:53,458
I was hoping you'd stay
and have dinner with us!

381
00:20:53,541 --> 00:20:54,791
My mother and
father have really been

382
00:20:54,875 --> 00:20:56,708
looking forward
to meeting you.

383
00:20:56,791 --> 00:20:59,583
And if you're interested in
paintings, my mother and father

384
00:20:59,666 --> 00:21:02,666
have many interesting
pieces in their collection.

385
00:21:06,208 --> 00:21:07,958
My...

386
00:21:08,041 --> 00:21:10,541
...what a stirring
painting this is.

387

This is my father's.

388
00:21:11,958 --> 00:21:15,000
The ones that my mother
has collected are over here.
