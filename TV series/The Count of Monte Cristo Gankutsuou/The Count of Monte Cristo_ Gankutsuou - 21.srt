00:01:50,208 --> 00:01:53,208
[NARRATOR] Madames and
Messieurs, good evening.

2
00:01:53,291 --> 00:01:55,208
Those who forge
their own destiny

3
00:01:55,291 --> 00:01:57,083
and those who balk at it...

4
00:01:57,166 --> 00:01:59,583
Time visits all men equally

5
00:01:59,666 --> 00:02:02,875
and imposes on them
a choice for the future.

6
00:02:02,958 --> 00:02:06,250
When the final letter entrusted
to the young man is read,

7
00:02:06,333 --> 00:02:10,708
what future will
that bring about for us?

8
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:18,666
[ALBERT]
Count!

9
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:20,125
There's something important
I have to talk to you about!

10
00:02:20,208 --> 00:02:22,208
Let me in! Count!

11
00:02:27,583 --> 00:02:30,375
Could he have
already left Paris?

12
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:43,000
[REPORTER] As Danglars Bank
stocks continue to plummet,

13
00:02:43,083 --> 00:02:45,416
customers swarm teller
windows in a desperate attempt

14
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,500
to withdraw their savings.

15
00:02:47,583 --> 00:02:49,083
At this time, the whereabouts

16
00:02:49,166 --> 00:02:51,958
of senior bank
management officials...

17
00:02:52,041 --> 00:02:53,666
You're a bunch of idiots!

18
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:56,250
[DANGLARS] I have your
precious treasure right here.

19
00:02:56,333 --> 00:02:59,708
After a fire, hold a
fire sale I always say.

20
00:02:59,791 --> 00:03:00,916
He, he, he!

21
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,500
With this stake money
I'm as good as gold.

22
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:07,708
With five trillion francs,
I can beat any speculator.

23
00:03:07,791 --> 00:03:10,541
Now, then, which stock
should I start with?

24
00:03:10,625 --> 00:03:13,958
Damn it. This is so
inefficient without Michelle!

25
00:03:17,583 --> 00:03:18,916
[DANGLARS gasps]

26
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,416
Good afternoon...
Monsieur Danglars.

27
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,750
Count, you startled me!

28
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:30,500
[DANGLARS]
I-I was under the impression

29
00:03:30,583 --> 00:03:33,125
that I had bought out all
the seats on this flight.

30
00:03:33,208 --> 00:03:34,875
I have come here from Paris.

31
00:03:34,958 --> 00:03:36,791
I had to chase you.

32
00:03:36,875 --> 00:03:38,625
Why would you do that?

33
00:03:38,708 --> 00:03:40,291
[MONTE CRISTO]
I had hoped to have you

34
00:03:40,375 --> 00:03:41,583
accommodate me with funds.

35
00:03:41,666 --> 00:03:44,666
Five trillion francs
in cash, right now.

36
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:47,208
Wha--? Five trillion?!

37
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,416
According to our
contract there is

38
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:52,125
no upper limit to
my line of credit.

39
00:03:52,208 --> 00:03:53,416
None at all.

40
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:54,833
You haven't forgotten?

41
00:03:54,916 --> 00:03:56,375
Oh no, Excellency.

42
00:03:56,458 --> 00:03:58,916
Believe me, I haven't
forgotten at all.

43
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,500
But you've caught me short.

44
00:04:00,583 --> 00:04:02,791
Since I'm traveling,
I'm really not carrying any--

45
00:04:02,875 --> 00:04:04,041
[MONTE CRISTO]
But you're carrying cash

46
00:04:04,125 --> 00:04:06,166
in that case, aren't you?

47
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:07,375
Oh this--

48
00:04:07,458 --> 00:04:08,916
[MONTE CRISTO]
Come, now. Give it to me.

49
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,625
I couldn't!
You see this money is--

50
00:04:11,708 --> 00:04:13,291
Now...

51
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:15,833
Now.

52
00:04:16,541 --> 00:04:17,541
Now!

[DANGLARS laughs]

55
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,791
If you'd just gone home,
you wouldn't have had to die.

56
00:04:24,875 --> 00:04:26,583
Stupid fool.

57
00:04:27,416 --> 00:04:30,958
I'm gonna have to do
something about the body...

[DANGLARS]
But... But you're--

61
00:04:46,875 --> 00:04:50,250
[MONTE CRISTO] My good
Baron, as greedy as ever.

62
00:04:50,333 --> 00:04:51,791
[MONTE CRISTO]
You haven't changed one bit

63
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:52,916
from the old days.

64
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,583
But how?

65
00:04:54,666 --> 00:04:57,875
[MONTE CRISTO] Look closely
at my face, my dear Baron

66
00:04:57,958 --> 00:05:00,083
and think back.

67
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:01,583
Remember the face of the man

68
00:05:01,666 --> 00:05:05,708
you consigned to
oblivion 25 years ago.

69
00:05:05,791 --> 00:05:07,500
Remember the
face of your friend,

70
00:05:07,583 --> 00:05:10,708
whom you incriminated
with your false accusations.

00:05:10,791 --> 00:05:12,750
With your lies!

[LECLERE]
Edmond...

74
00:05:22,083 --> 00:05:24,166
Take good care of this.

75
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:28,416
You will be the next
captain of the ship.

76
00:05:29,291 --> 00:05:30,875
Yes, sir.

77
00:05:34,541 --> 00:05:36,291
[DANGLARS] You called
for me, Acting Captain?

78
00:05:36,375 --> 00:05:38,958
Yes, I did. Danglars
these figures you entered

79
00:05:39,041 --> 00:05:40,833
in the trade ledgers
just don't add up.

80
00:05:40,916 --> 00:05:43,500
Oh, um well you see...

81
00:05:43,583 --> 00:05:47,125
When we were docked at Alpha
Centauri last month, there were-

82

[EDMOND]
Listen here!

83
00:05:48,083 --> 00:05:50,208
This is embezzlement, Danglars!

84
00:05:50,291 --> 00:05:52,291
[EDMOND]
I'll overlook it this one time.

85
00:05:52,375 --> 00:05:55,000
But if I ever see
it happen again...

86
00:05:57,458 --> 00:05:58,708
Hmph!

87
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:01,833
I guess you think you're
the Captain already, huh?

All right everybody!

Three cheers for Edmond!

Young Mercedes has fallen
head over heels for that boy!

91

Compared to him,
all the other guys

who hit on her are
no better than garbage!

To them!

I pray they'll live
happily ever after! Forever!

There's really no such
thing as a perfect man.

100

You agree, Fernand?

101
00:06:35,166 --> 00:06:37,583
[DANGLARS]
I mean let's face it, Mondego.

102
00:06:37,666 --> 00:06:41,458
Every man ought to have
a flaw or two. Right?

Heh.

105
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:46,041
[DANGLARS] When Captain Leclere
was on his deathbed,

106
00:06:46,125 --> 00:06:48,750
he entrusted Edmond
with a letter to protect.

107

What do you suppose was in it?

108
00:06:51,958 --> 00:06:54,166
I heard it was a
secret document addressed

109
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:55,791
to Parisian dissidents.

110

[FERNAND gasps]

111
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:59,208
[DANGLARS] Eh? Pretty
interesting, isn't it?

112
00:06:59,291 --> 00:07:01,541
Now, if we were
to humbly bring it

113
00:07:01,625 --> 00:07:04,041
to the government's attention,
what do you suppose

114
00:07:04,125 --> 00:07:05,625
would happen to Edmond?

[MERCEDES]
Edmond! Edmond!

117
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,291
[EDMOND] Mercedes! This is
all some kind of mistake!

118
00:07:13,375 --> 00:07:15,250
Don't worry about me!

119
00:07:18,458 --> 00:07:20,958
Y-You're still alive?

120
00:07:23,166 --> 00:07:26,375
[DANGLARS] This sure
brings back old memories...

121
00:07:26,458 --> 00:07:28,583
Those days on the ship,

122
00:07:28,666 --> 00:07:31,208
when we all sailed the
sea of stars together.

123
00:07:31,291 --> 00:07:32,833
And then...

124
00:07:41,458 --> 00:07:44,208
What are you going to do to me?!

125
00:07:45,291 --> 00:07:47,750
If you think that I was
the one who set you up,

126
00:07:47,833 --> 00:07:50,250
you've got it all wrong!
I had nothing to do with it.

127
00:07:50,333 --> 00:07:52,416
I-It was Fernand!
He did it to get your woman!

128
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:53,916
I only told him about the letter

129
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,125
because he was so
depressed about everything.

130
00:07:56,208 --> 00:07:58,208
We all thought that it
would be a funny prank

131
00:07:58,291 --> 00:08:00,291
if we reported the
letter was yours...

132
00:08:00,375 --> 00:08:03,250
I swear I only
meant it as a joke!

133
00:08:10,666 --> 00:08:13,125
[MONTE CRISTO] Out of jealousy
and unjustified resentment,

134
00:08:13,208 --> 00:08:17,375
your cohorts sent an innocent
young man to rot in prison.

135
00:08:17,458 --> 00:08:19,541
Is that not the case?

136
00:08:19,625 --> 00:08:20,666
No!

137
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:24,000
It wasn't like that!
I hated you!

138
00:08:24,083 --> 00:08:27,583
You were nothing but a constant
nagging irritation to me!

139
00:08:27,666 --> 00:08:29,541
It made me sick to look at you!

140
00:08:29,625 --> 00:08:31,750
I didn't have any reason!

141
00:08:31,833 --> 00:08:34,875
I just wanted to get
Edmond Dantes out of my sight!

142
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:37,750
I wanted him gone forever!

143
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:45,708
[DANGLARS]
These are...

144
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:49,250
This is amazing!

145
00:08:49,333 --> 00:08:51,791
[MONTE CRISTO] I appreciate
your candor, Messieur.

146
00:08:51,875 --> 00:08:54,666
Now, accept my humble
way of repaying you

147
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:56,708
for the cost of your bullets.

148
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:04,833
[DANGLARS] Please!
Wait a minute! Edmond, wait!

149
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:07,041
[MONTE CRISTO]
Rejoice, Messieur.

150
00:09:07,125 --> 00:09:11,541
For everything that you touch
turns to glimmering gold.

No! Wait!

152
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,166
[MONTE CRISTO]
Take it.

Humph!

Hey! Wait don't leave me here!

Please!

157
00:09:37,916 --> 00:09:42,208
Wait! Come back!

158
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:55,125
[MONTE CRISTO]
And that is one.

[BAPTISTIN] Hey, find somewhere
else to sleep, will ya?

[BAPTISTIN] You've been
waiting here all this time?

163
00:10:09,166 --> 00:10:11,416
Geeze, what a tenacious
young man you are.

164
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,291
Don't mock me! Not now--

165
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:15,583
"I simply must speak
with the Count right away!"

166
00:10:15,666 --> 00:10:18,125
Is that what you're
trying to say to me?

167
00:10:18,208 --> 00:10:19,416
Lay off!

168
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:20,791
You're his flunky,
it's none of your business!

169
00:10:20,875 --> 00:10:22,083
Yes, you're right.

170
00:10:22,166 --> 00:10:24,000
Gosh, and here I was
about to tell you exactly

171
00:10:24,083 --> 00:10:27,083
where His Excellency
is right now.

172
00:10:27,166 --> 00:10:29,541
[BAPTISTIN] Come on, wipe
that look off your face.

173
00:10:29,625 --> 00:10:31,250
The Count's in space.

174
00:10:31,333 --> 00:10:33,916
And right about now,
I bet Danglars is--

175
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:34,958
You're kidding me!

176
00:10:35,041 --> 00:10:36,791
Look, kid, you
can struggle against

177
00:10:36,875 --> 00:10:38,333
what's happening all you want,

178
00:10:38,416 --> 00:10:40,291
but it won't do you any good.

179
00:10:40,375 --> 00:10:42,333
Hey, you're the Count's
right-hand man, aren't you?!

180
00:10:42,416 --> 00:10:43,833
Then why the hell don't you try

181
00:10:43,916 --> 00:10:45,291
to stop him
before it's too late?

182
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:46,833
Why can't you understand
how the Count

183
00:10:46,916 --> 00:10:49,458
really feels and keep him
from doing something terrible?

184
00:10:49,541 --> 00:10:51,750
Don't stand there and talk
like you know everything!

185
00:10:51,833 --> 00:10:54,166
Why can't you understand
that he has no choice?!

186
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:56,458
He has to get revenge
no matter what.

187
00:10:56,541 --> 00:10:58,125
He can't forget the past.

188
00:10:58,208 --> 00:11:00,833
He has to act in
spite of how he feels.

189
00:11:02,916 --> 00:11:06,166
[ALBERT]
Yeah well, I suppose, I mean...

190
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:08,750
...maybe what you're
saying about him is true.

191
00:11:08,833 --> 00:11:11,583
But there's something that I
have to tell the him right away!

192
00:11:13,625 --> 00:11:15,875
Right. They say that
Villefort's first trial

193
00:11:15,958 --> 00:11:17,250
is gonna be tomorrow.

194
00:11:17,333 --> 00:11:18,750
What?

195
00:11:18,833 --> 00:11:21,000
[BAPTISTIN] Now, it's time
for little boys to be in bed!

196
00:11:21,083 --> 00:11:22,166
Go home!

197
00:11:28,708 --> 00:11:31,958
[BAPTISTIN] Excellency,
this kid might turn out

198
00:11:32,041 --> 00:11:35,958
to be a whole lot tougher
than you think he is.

199
00:11:42,291 --> 00:11:44,333
[JUDGE A] This trial in the
case of the poisoning

200
00:11:44,416 --> 00:11:46,833
in the Villefort household,
as well as the attempted murder

201
00:11:46,916 --> 00:11:50,375
of the Count of Monte Cristo,
will now come to order.

202
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,291
[VILLEFORT] I would like to make
a statement before we begin.

203
00:11:54,375 --> 00:11:56,833
My actions were
not out of self-interest.

204
00:11:56,916 --> 00:11:59,125
I did what I did in order
to protect the peace

205
00:11:59,208 --> 00:12:00,791
and public order of Paris.

206
00:12:00,875 --> 00:12:03,666
As such, I plead not guilty
with no shame or remorse

207
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:06,458
for my actions, and will be
acting as my own attorney.

208
00:12:09,416 --> 00:12:11,666
[GUARD] You can't come in if
you don't have a permit!

209
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:13,166
Go away!

210
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:14,916
[PROSECUTOR] This poisoning was
the result of the attempt

211
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,333
by Heloise, Monsieur
Villefort's second wife,

212
00:12:17,416 --> 00:12:19,875
to poison her stepdaughter
Valentine in order

213
00:12:19,958 --> 00:12:21,541
to get at her inheritance.

214
00:12:21,625 --> 00:12:23,375
Monsieur Villefort
falsely accused

215
00:12:23,458 --> 00:12:25,750
the Count of Monte Cristo
of these crimes

216
00:12:25,833 --> 00:12:27,791
and then attempted to kill him.

217
00:12:27,875 --> 00:12:30,291
Rather than being motivated
by love for his wife,

218
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:32,041
these acts were an attempt--

219
00:12:32,125 --> 00:12:33,166
[VILLEFORT]
How dare you?!

220
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:35,041
Monte Cristo is a
disruptive hooligan

221
00:12:35,125 --> 00:12:37,666
who is intent on
throwing Paris into turmoil!

222
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:41,041
And possibly a spy
sent here by the Empire!

223
00:12:41,416 --> 00:12:42,708
[JUDGE A]
Did he say spy?

224
00:12:42,791 --> 00:12:44,291
[JUDGE B]
He did.

225
00:12:44,375 --> 00:12:46,625
As a long serving and faithful
officer of the court and crown,

226
00:12:46,708 --> 00:12:49,916
I call for the arrest of
the Count of Monte Cristo!

227
00:12:53,625 --> 00:12:55,208
[PROSECUTOR]
Is that really the case?

228
00:12:55,291 --> 00:12:56,458
[VILLEFORT]
Of course!

229
00:12:56,541 --> 00:12:58,125
[PROSECUTOR]
I would like to call a witness

230
00:12:58,208 --> 00:13:00,625
who will help shed some
light on the defendant's past.

231
00:13:00,708 --> 00:13:08,583
[CROWD gasping, murmuring]

232
00:13:08,666 --> 00:13:09,916
Order in the court!

233
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,791
The witness will state his name.

234
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:15,750
[ANDREA] My name is
Andrea Cavalcanti your honor.

235
00:13:15,833 --> 00:13:17,666
Admittedly, it is an alias.

236
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:20,750
[JUDGE A] The witness will
answer the question truthfully.

237
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:24,125
In the orphanage where I grew
up I was called Benedetto.

238
00:13:24,208 --> 00:13:27,083
But I don't know what
name I was born with.

239
00:13:27,166 --> 00:13:29,375
[PROSECUTOR] I see here that
you were known to the public

240
00:13:29,458 --> 00:13:32,125
as the head of a notable
aristocratic family, is that so?

241
00:13:32,208 --> 00:13:34,416
Oh please, no,
I'm not an aristocrat.

242
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:35,916
I'm nothing of the sort.

243
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,791
I was abandoned as an infant,
raised in an orphanage,

244
00:13:38,875 --> 00:13:41,833
and once I got out, I did
everything under the sun.

245
00:13:43,083 --> 00:13:47,125
[ANDREA]
Larceny. Arson. And even murder.

246
00:13:47,208 --> 00:13:50,958
And what does this have to do
with the case before this court?

247
00:13:51,041 --> 00:13:52,500
[ANDREA]
A great deal.

248
00:13:52,583 --> 00:13:56,208
I'm here to tell the story of
the secret behind my birth.

249
00:13:56,291 --> 00:13:58,000
[VILLEFORT]
Stop joking!

250
00:13:58,083 --> 00:13:59,333
[JUDGE A]
Order in the court!

251
00:13:59,416 --> 00:14:01,708
Continue with your testimony.

252
00:14:01,791 --> 00:14:03,791
[ANDREA] I was born in
Auteuil, in the mansion

253
00:14:03,875 --> 00:14:05,833
on the estate that the
Count of Monte Cristo

254
00:14:05,916 --> 00:14:08,625
has been recently
using as his villa.

255
00:14:09,458 --> 00:14:12,666
[ANDREA] I was buried alive
immediately after I was born.

256
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:14,916
In a tiny little coffin.

257
00:14:17,041 --> 00:14:18,041
The man who fathered me

258
00:14:18,125 --> 00:14:19,916
must have been
in a complete panic.

259
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
A judge with a bright
future having a child

260
00:14:22,083 --> 00:14:23,500
by his secret lover?

261
00:14:23,583 --> 00:14:26,416
Even in Paris that sort
of thing is frowned upon.

262
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:27,916
So he sheltered my mother

263
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,916
in the mansion at
Auteuil, and took--

264
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,416
Your Honor!

265
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,250
Perhaps it would be prudent
if we adjourned for the day.

266
00:14:33,333 --> 00:14:35,791
The defendant
is to remain silent!

267
00:14:36,916 --> 00:14:39,833
Obviously he's nothing
more than a hired blackmailer!

268
00:14:39,916 --> 00:14:41,500
Who paid you to do this?!

269
00:14:41,583 --> 00:14:43,166
[ANDREA]
Is this any way to treat me?

270
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:45,666
After all, it's
been 17 years.

271
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:47,583
[PROSECUTOR] The people enter
into evidence the results

272
00:14:47,666 --> 00:14:51,125
of DNA testing on the
defendant and the witness.

273

[VICTORIA gasping]

274
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,041
[JUDGE A]
What is this?

275
00:15:04,125 --> 00:15:05,541
[ANDREA]
The coffin.

276
00:15:05,625 --> 00:15:09,583
The coffin that my parents
gave to me instead of a crib.

277
00:15:09,666 --> 00:15:12,083
[VICTORIA]
Please, stop this!

I begging you! No more!

279
00:15:14,791 --> 00:15:16,125
[ANDREA]
Excellent timing.

280
00:15:16,208 --> 00:15:18,583
Allow me to introduce my mother.

281
00:15:18,666 --> 00:15:22,041
This is Baroness
Victoria Danglars.

282
00:15:23,666 --> 00:15:25,708
Come now, isn't
that true, Mother?

283
00:15:25,791 --> 00:15:27,291
Father shoved me into this box

284
00:15:27,375 --> 00:15:31,208
and then buried me in the garden
behind the mansion, didn't he?

285
00:15:36,083 --> 00:15:37,541

My baby is that really you?

Forgive me! Please, forgive me!

[VILLEFORT]
Be quiet! Shut up this instant!

292
00:16:01,583 --> 00:16:03,166
That woman's out of her mind!

293
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:04,208
[ANDREA]
Father!

294
00:16:04,291 --> 00:16:06,333
Don't say such
things about Mother.

295
00:16:06,416 --> 00:16:08,541
That was terrible.

296
00:16:08,625 --> 00:16:10,000
It's him, isn't it?!

297
00:16:10,083 --> 00:16:12,583
[VILLEFORT] He must be the
one who put you up to this!

00:16:13,708 --> 00:16:15,333
Your Honor, the
two of them made up

299
00:16:15,416 --> 00:16:16,750
this entire preposterous story!

300
00:16:16,833 --> 00:16:18,500
It's the only explanation!

301
00:16:18,583 --> 00:16:20,541
I mean, that baby
is dead and buried.

302
00:16:20,625 --> 00:16:21,583
He's long gone.

303
00:16:21,666 --> 00:16:23,833
He couldn't
possibly turn up and--

304
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:25,833
[PROSECUTOR] Your Honor,
please enter the defendant's

305

statement into the record.

306
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,375
No! I only meant that he--

307

[JUDGE A]

00:16:30,583 --> 00:16:31,916
[VILLEFORT]
You have to listen to me!

309
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,541
This is all a trap!
You lousy con artist!

310
00:16:41,833 --> 00:16:44,375
The servant who saved my
life left this scrap of cloth

311
00:16:44,458 --> 00:16:46,833
with me when he sent
me to the orphanage.

312
00:16:46,916 --> 00:16:48,958
He must have wrapped
me in this warm cloth

313
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:51,541
so that I wouldn't
freeze to death.

314

My whole life, this has been the

most important thing
in the world to me.

not just a piece of cloth.

00:16:59,291 --> 00:17:02,708
It's the thing that
connects me to you.

318
00:17:03,666 --> 00:17:08,750
Then... you really
are who you say you are?

319
00:17:08,833 --> 00:17:10,958
[ANDREA]
I'm sorry, Father.

320
00:17:11,041 --> 00:17:13,041
But if I hadn't
resorted to this,

321
00:17:13,125 --> 00:17:14,625
you would have
never accepted the fact

322
00:17:14,708 --> 00:17:16,750
that I'm really your son.

323
00:17:17,583 --> 00:17:20,166
[ANDREA]
I so wanted to meet you...

324
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:21,625
Father...

325
00:17:26,416 --> 00:17:27,333
[VILLEFORT groans]

326
00:17:27,416 --> 00:17:28,541
[ANDREA]
Goodbye Father.

327
00:17:28,625 --> 00:17:31,166
[VICTORIA screaming]

328
00:17:31,625 --> 00:17:34,541
But why? Why, son?

329
00:17:35,791 --> 00:17:39,125
[ANDREA cackling]

330
00:17:39,208 --> 00:17:40,666
You can all kiss my ass!

331
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:42,000
Every one of you!

332
00:17:42,083 --> 00:17:44,750
Just looking at your faces
makes me want to puke!

333
00:17:44,833 --> 00:17:46,000
In the end, all you bastards

334
00:17:46,083 --> 00:17:48,875
are bloodthirsty animals
no different from us!

335
00:17:48,958 --> 00:17:50,375
[ANDREA]
You hide your filthy natures

336
00:17:50,458 --> 00:17:52,750
behind those respectable masks!

337
00:17:52,833 --> 00:17:56,916
You do! And you! And so do you!

338
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:06,625
[ANDREA cackling]

339
00:18:08,083 --> 00:18:10,291
[MERCEDES] I seem to recall
a Monsieur Dantes

340
00:18:10,375 --> 00:18:12,541
living here a long time ago.

341
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:14,583
[RESIDENT] I wouldn't know
about that, Madame.

342
00:18:14,666 --> 00:18:17,750
This place has stood empty
for a quite a while now.

343
00:18:26,916 --> 00:18:28,666
[MERCEDES]
Edmond...

344
00:18:34,083 --> 00:18:35,833
[LOUIS]
Mercedes...

345
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:39,416
[LOUIS] You're still a young
and beautiful girl...

346
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:42,208
And... And something tells me

347
00:18:42,291 --> 00:18:45,166
my boy isn't coming back again.

348
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:47,583
Mercedes, you
shouldn't spend your life

349
00:18:47,666 --> 00:18:50,708
looking after a
weak old man like me.

350
00:18:50,791 --> 00:18:53,625
I think you should go...

351
00:18:53,708 --> 00:18:55,375
Summer is almost over.

352
00:18:55,458 --> 00:18:58,125
[MERCEDES]
No! I won't!

353
00:18:58,916 --> 00:19:01,625
He'll come back! I know it!

354
00:19:01,708 --> 00:19:04,708
[MERCEDES sobbing]

355
00:19:07,916 --> 00:19:09,250
You bastard!

356
00:19:09,333 --> 00:19:12,083
How are we feeling?
Better, I hope?

357
00:19:12,166 --> 00:19:13,708
Who are you?

358
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:17,083
What do you want?
Why are you doing all this?

359
00:19:17,166 --> 00:19:19,083
[MONTE CRISTO]
Oh, dear, have you forgotten?

360
00:19:19,166 --> 00:19:20,125
What?!

361
00:19:20,208 --> 00:19:21,541
Have you forgotten me,

362
00:19:21,625 --> 00:19:25,833
the innocent man you
convicted 25 years ago,

363
00:19:25,916 --> 00:19:28,916
when you were the district
judge for Marseilles?

364
00:19:30,833 --> 00:19:33,291
[MONTE CRISTO] The instant you
discovered that your own name

365
00:19:33,375 --> 00:19:34,625
was listed in that letter,

366
00:19:34,708 --> 00:19:37,041
you decided to secretly
eliminate the man

367
00:19:37,125 --> 00:19:40,125
from whom you had taken it.

368
00:19:40,208 --> 00:19:42,208
[VILLEFORT]
Edmond Dantes?!

369
00:19:42,291 --> 00:19:44,541
Is that you?!
I don't understand.

370
00:19:44,625 --> 00:19:46,250
[MONTE CRISTO]
The man whom you once knew

371
00:19:46,333 --> 00:19:48,750
by that humble name
died many years ago

372
00:19:48,833 --> 00:19:50,875
in the prison of
the Chateau d'If

373
00:19:50,958 --> 00:19:54,666
and returned to
life as Gankutsuou.

374
00:19:56,125 --> 00:19:58,125
That letter you were
carrying was dangerous!

375
00:19:58,208 --> 00:20:00,083
For us and for all of Paris!

376
00:20:00,166 --> 00:20:01,458
If I hadn't done something,

377
00:20:01,541 --> 00:20:04,583
the government would
have fallen into utter chaos!

378
00:20:04,666 --> 00:20:06,333
You see, I had no choice!

379
00:20:06,416 --> 00:20:09,833
[MONTE CRISTO] You are indeed
a patriot, Monsieur Villefort!

380
00:20:09,916 --> 00:20:12,875
However, the real
motive for your actions

381
00:20:12,958 --> 00:20:16,625
was to protect
yourself, wasn't it?

382
00:20:16,708 --> 00:20:18,875
[VILLEFORT] It was to
maintain law and order.

383
00:20:18,958 --> 00:20:20,833
[MONTE CRISTO]
And that meritorious deed

384
00:20:20,916 --> 00:20:23,166
made you the man you are now.

385
00:20:24,208 --> 00:20:26,958
Humph! All for nothing.

386
00:20:27,041 --> 00:20:30,000
By the way, that needle
was dipped in poison.

387
00:20:30,708 --> 00:20:31,875
Wh-What?!

388
00:20:31,958 --> 00:20:34,083
[MONTE CRISTO]
That poison will be a blessing.

389
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:36,666
It will rot your brain
and send you to a place

390
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:40,250
where no decent person could
convict you of any crime.

391
00:20:40,333 --> 00:20:42,250
No. No, wait!

392
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,500
No! No! Not that! No!

393
00:20:45,583 --> 00:20:49,000
[MONTE CRISTO] Villefort, a poor
servant of the Crown...

394
00:20:49,083 --> 00:20:52,375
The velvet wings of your
precious law will cradle you

395
00:20:52,458 --> 00:20:55,666
until the end of your existence.

396
00:21:01,208 --> 00:21:04,833
[MONTE CRISTO]
And that makes two.

397
00:21:11,708 --> 00:21:13,250
[GUARD]
Start walking.

398
00:21:17,625 --> 00:21:18,875
[ROBOT]
Warning!

399
00:21:18,958 --> 00:21:20,791
Eastern Fleet flagship has
crossed Rubicon Line!

400
00:21:20,875 --> 00:21:22,041
Be advised.

401
00:21:22,125 --> 00:21:24,541
According to Article 59
of the Military Code,

402
00:21:24,625 --> 00:21:26,708
this is considered an act of--

403
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,583
[ALBERT] In spite of everything,
the past will not let go of men.

404
00:23:31,666 --> 00:23:33,083
Vengeance gives
rise to violence,

405
00:23:33,166 --> 00:23:35,666
and the cycle of
sorrow continues.

406
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:38,958
Next Gankutsuou, The Count
of Monte Cristo, Act 22:

407
00:23:39,041 --> 00:23:40,333
"Counterattack".

408
00:23:40,416 --> 00:23:42,666
Bide your time,
and hold out hope!
