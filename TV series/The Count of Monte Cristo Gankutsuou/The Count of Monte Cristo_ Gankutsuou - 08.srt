00:10:19,083 --> 00:10:22,833
I guess I made you do
my dirty work for me. Sorry.

163
00:10:22,916 --> 00:10:24,666
You see,
the thing is Franz,

164
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:27,250
I think Valentine,
really loves you.

165
00:10:27,333 --> 00:10:28,375
You're kidding!

166
00:10:28,458 --> 00:10:31,166
Yeah, she does!

167
00:10:31,541 --> 00:10:33,958
I'm almost sure of it.

168

Eugenie's gotten really
good at playing, hasn't she?

169
00:10:39,458 --> 00:10:41,500
Hey Franz, don't
change the subject.

170
00:10:41,583 --> 00:10:45,000
I didn't tell you but, I had a
talk with Eugenie the other day.

171
00:10:45,083 --> 00:10:47,833
I bet she had a lot of bad
things to say about me.

172
00:10:47,916 --> 00:10:50,083
Pretty much.

C'mon, tell me!

What if someone sees us?

179
00:11:03,625 --> 00:11:04,958
But when we're here,

180
00:11:05,041 --> 00:11:07,541
I can't help thinking
about our child...!

181
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:09,041
Shh!

Magnificent.

00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,166
I see that music is truly
your calling, Mademoiselle.

185
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:42,708
It's her calling, huh?

186
00:11:42,791 --> 00:11:44,291
Well, I guess it
must be true.

187
00:11:44,375 --> 00:11:47,333
The Count has met a lot of very
talented people in his travels.

188
00:11:47,416 --> 00:11:49,916
[MALE] Thank you for
the lovely performance...

189
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,708
...my lovely lady.

190
00:11:57,083 --> 00:11:58,791
How do you do?

191
00:11:58,875 --> 00:12:00,208
Huh?!

192
00:12:00,291 --> 00:12:02,708
Now that one talented youth
has made her artistic debut,

193
00:12:02,791 --> 00:12:05,625
please allow me to
introduce another to you all.

194
00:12:05,708 --> 00:12:08,958
This is the Marquis
Andrea Cavalcanti.

195
00:12:11,208 --> 00:12:13,083
Oh, my...

196
00:12:14,458 --> 00:12:17,333
Am I to understand that
that family had an heir?

197
00:12:17,416 --> 00:12:18,583
The Marquis' father

198
00:12:18,666 --> 00:12:21,000
is one of my oldest and
dearest aquaintences.

199
00:12:21,083 --> 00:12:22,958
If you would all make
him feel as welcome

200
00:12:23,041 --> 00:12:25,666
as you have me, nothing
would make me happier.

201
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:27,166
I know I am
an untested youth

202
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:30,208
who just inherited his
late father's estate...

203
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:31,875
...but I am honored
to meet you.

204
00:12:31,958 --> 00:12:34,000
Look at the brooch
the Marquis is wearing!

205
00:12:34,083 --> 00:12:36,250
It must cost five million!

206
00:12:38,208 --> 00:12:39,625
Who is that guy?

207
00:12:39,708 --> 00:12:41,791
I'd have to say it's probably
the Count's new favorite.

208
00:12:41,875 --> 00:12:43,333
Wha-?!

209
00:12:43,416 --> 00:12:45,958
You know I'll bet he has all
kinds of interesting talents!

210
00:12:46,041 --> 00:12:47,333
Humph!

211
00:12:47,875 --> 00:12:50,166
Well, my friends...

212
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:53,083
Please forgive me, I do hate
to interrupt your conversation

213
00:12:53,166 --> 00:12:54,208
but if I might
have your attention

214
00:12:54,291 --> 00:12:56,750
for just a few moments please?

215
00:12:56,833 --> 00:12:58,166
One of the reasons

216
00:12:58,250 --> 00:12:59,958
that I decided to
purchase this estate...

217
00:13:00,041 --> 00:13:01,500
...was to escape
the noise of the city

218
00:13:01,583 --> 00:13:05,833
and to spend as much time as
possible in quiet contemplation.

219
00:13:05,916 --> 00:13:08,833
But contrary to that,
once I arrived here,

220
00:13:08,916 --> 00:13:11,583
this wonderful villa
I found myself fascinated

221
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:15,208
by a certain aura that
pervades this old mansion.

222
00:13:15,291 --> 00:13:16,750
A certain aura?

223
00:13:16,833 --> 00:13:18,583
And what might that be?

224
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:24,500
Let's see, how might
one best describe it...?

225
00:13:24,583 --> 00:13:29,208
Yes... In a word...

226
00:13:29,291 --> 00:13:30,125
...a curse.

227
00:13:30,208 --> 00:13:31,666
[VICTORIA gasps][

228
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:33,791
[MONTE CRISTO] I found myself
pondering certain questions.

229
00:13:33,875 --> 00:13:37,750
What sorts of lives were led by
the people who once lived here?

230
00:13:37,833 --> 00:13:40,750
And what sad events
occurred in this place

231
00:13:40,833 --> 00:13:44,208
that were hidden away
from the eyes of all?

232
00:13:44,291 --> 00:13:46,916
When my mind toys
with such thoughts,

233
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,333
I am filled with a feeling

234
00:13:48,416 --> 00:13:52,583
of inexpressible
joy and tranquility.

235
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:57,416
There's no doubt about it...

236
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:59,750
It's him, I'm certain.

237
00:14:01,333 --> 00:14:03,583
A curse?!
Preposterous!

238
00:14:03,666 --> 00:14:05,750
Monsieur Prosecutor,
you're not suggesting

239
00:14:05,833 --> 00:14:08,208
that you do not sense
the gloomy, malevolent aura

240
00:14:08,291 --> 00:14:11,333
that pervades this
entire mansion? Are you?

241
00:14:11,416 --> 00:14:13,416
That's Crown Prosecutor.

242
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:14,916
Very well then,
I take it, then,

243
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
that you must see it
with your own two eyes

244
00:14:17,083 --> 00:14:18,500
before you'll believe it.

245
00:14:18,583 --> 00:14:21,625
In truth, there is one room
deep inside this mansion

246
00:14:21,708 --> 00:14:25,125
that I have left exactly as
it was when I first arrived.

247
00:14:25,208 --> 00:14:28,000
Why would you do that, sir?

248
00:14:28,583 --> 00:14:33,125
I have come to believe it
is that undisturbed room,

249
00:14:33,208 --> 00:14:34,291
which is the source

250
00:14:34,375 --> 00:14:38,208
of the malevolent
aura here in this house.

251
00:14:42,583 --> 00:14:44,750
How rude! We're leaving.

252
00:14:44,833 --> 00:14:46,125
But, Monsieur!

253
00:14:46,208 --> 00:14:49,541
Now, now, now,
don't be like that, sir!

254
00:14:49,625 --> 00:14:51,500
I for one say that
we should all indulge

255
00:14:51,583 --> 00:14:53,875
our host's small eccentricities.

256
00:14:55,625 --> 00:14:56,875
What do you say, everyone?

257
00:14:56,958 --> 00:14:59,541
Why don't we go see this
"evil room" for ourselves?

258
00:14:59,625 --> 00:15:00,541
It'll be interesting.

259
00:15:00,625 --> 00:15:01,875
Just a moment, please!

00:15:01,958 --> 00:15:03,041
Hm?

261

I'm afraid that all
of you going at once

262
00:15:04,333 --> 00:15:06,416
would spoil the entertainment.

Me?

267
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:17,875
I suggest that you split
yourselves into three groups

268
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:19,583
to search for the room.

269
00:15:19,666 --> 00:15:21,916
Then, we should have
these three young people

270
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,583
lead each of the
groups on their quest.

271
00:15:24,666 --> 00:15:26,666
And to make this
game more interesting,

272
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:29,625
I will offer a small gift to
those who successfully reach

273
00:15:29,708 --> 00:15:33,125
the innermost depths
of this dark mansion.

274
00:15:33,208 --> 00:15:34,000
Are we agreed?

275
00:15:34,083 --> 00:15:35,666
Yes, I like it!

276
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:37,500
Sounds like a lot fun!

00:15:48,291 --> 00:15:49,833

Remember, the early
bird gets the worm.

285
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,625
I was curious, Marquis
Andrea, where are you from?

Oh. Well I come from the far
reaches of the eastern galaxy.

There is an absolutley beautiful
planetary cluster there.

On one of those
planets lives a bird...

of brilliant sparkling jewels.

It was given to me
by my late father.

322
00:18:23,791 --> 00:18:25,958
I would like for
you to have it.

323
00:18:29,333 --> 00:18:31,250
[ALBERT]
It's a dead end...

324
00:18:31,583 --> 00:18:33,750
[VILLEFORT] I've had enough
of this nonsense, Albert.

325
00:18:33,833 --> 00:18:35,958
Madame Danglars
is very tired.

326
00:18:36,041 --> 00:18:37,208
We are turning back now.

327
00:18:37,291 --> 00:18:38,791
[ALBERT]
Monsieur Villefort!

328
00:18:38,875 --> 00:18:40,666
There's a door
over there!

329
00:18:41,416 --> 00:18:43,500
[VICTORIA]
Th-Th-This is--

330
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:45,041
Shh!

331
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:08,916
[MONTE CRISTO]
Congratulations!

332
00:19:10,791 --> 00:19:13,208
Your party is
the first to arrive.

333
00:19:13,291 --> 00:19:14,666
Did you all enjoy

334
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:17,625
the mysterious ambiance
this mansion exudes?

335
00:19:17,708 --> 00:19:19,875
It's quite unique
don't you think?

336
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:21,500
[VILLEFORT] I see that
the master of this house

337
00:19:21,583 --> 00:19:24,708
doesn't know the proper
way to entertain guests!

338
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:28,125
Well then, Monsieur Albert,

339
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:30,666
might I ask for your
assistance for a moment?

340
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:32,666
Oh, uh yes, sir!

341
00:19:35,583 --> 00:19:39,666
I want to thank you for
playing along with my game.

342
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:42,750
It must have been difficult.

343
00:19:42,833 --> 00:19:45,041
I'm sorry,
Your Excellency.

344
00:19:45,125 --> 00:19:49,000
Sorry? Whatever for?

345
00:19:49,083 --> 00:19:52,708
The truth is, I...

346
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:55,083
I didn't mean to but I...

347
00:19:55,166 --> 00:19:58,083
I saw you in Madame
Villefort's greenhouse.

348
00:19:58,875 --> 00:20:00,291
[MONTE CRISTO laughs]

349
00:20:00,375 --> 00:20:01,666
Goodness, how awkward.

350
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:03,666
So, you saw us, did you?

351
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:04,708
You see...

352
00:20:04,791 --> 00:20:08,250
Madame would not
take no for an answer.

353
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:09,708
I just assumed that
you were angry with me

354
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:11,708
for seeing the two of you!

355
00:20:11,791 --> 00:20:13,375
Perish the thought!

356
00:20:13,458 --> 00:20:16,166
[MONTE CRISTO laughs]

357
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:19,000
[BOTH laughing]

358
00:20:19,083 --> 00:20:23,541
Incidentally, it is actually
I who should apologize to you.

359
00:20:23,625 --> 00:20:27,083
I have been unable to speak
with you properly until today.

360
00:20:27,166 --> 00:20:31,916
Albert, I suffer from an
illness I contracted in space.

361
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,958
And so from time to time,
it is necessary for me to rest

362
00:20:35,041 --> 00:20:36,833
without seeing
anyone for a while.

363
00:20:43,458 --> 00:20:45,000
What...?

364
00:20:45,083 --> 00:20:47,875
Don't worry it really
isn't anything serious.

365
00:20:47,958 --> 00:20:50,583
I do feel a
numbness occasionally.

366
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:53,208
Albert.

367
00:20:53,291 --> 00:20:58,208
Listen Albert, this is a secret
known only to you and myself.

368
00:20:59,208 --> 00:21:03,500
A secret between you and I.

369
00:21:04,875 --> 00:21:08,000
I understand.
I give you my word.

370
00:21:08,083 --> 00:21:09,333
Good...

371
00:21:09,416 --> 00:21:13,541
In that case, let us carry
this box through the door.

372
00:21:13,625 --> 00:21:14,916
[VICTORIA]
This is the room

373
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,833
where I gave birth
to the child...!

374
00:21:17,916 --> 00:21:21,583
I fear the child has summoned
us here to avenge himself!

375
00:21:21,666 --> 00:21:23,125
[VILLEFORT]
Calm yourself!

376
00:21:23,208 --> 00:21:24,333
I can't!!

377
00:21:24,416 --> 00:21:27,750
17 years ago...
We sinned!

378
00:21:27,833 --> 00:21:29,541
[ALBERT]
Congratulations!

379
00:21:29,625 --> 00:21:31,916
This is our gift
from the Count!

380
00:21:33,833 --> 00:21:37,375
[VICTORIA yells]

381
00:21:38,958 --> 00:21:41,166
Madame!

382
00:21:42,208 --> 00:21:44,083
How could you...

383
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:48,000
Who the...
Who the devil are you?!

384
00:23:28,833 --> 00:23:31,083
[ALBERT] A poisonous
evil stalks the lovers.

385
00:23:31,166 --> 00:23:32,791
But I am still unaware

386
00:23:32,875 --> 00:23:34,833
that I am about to
fall prey to it, as well.

387
00:23:34,916 --> 00:23:38,125
Next Gankutsuou,
The Count of Monte Cristo,

388
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:39,958
Act 9: "I Dreamed a Dark Dream."

389
00:23:40,041 --> 00:23:42,375
Bide your time,
and hold out hope!
