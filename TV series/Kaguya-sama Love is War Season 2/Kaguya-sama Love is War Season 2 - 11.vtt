That's right.

[YU]
I don't know how,

00:15:18.543 --> 00:15:21.588 position:50% align:center
but despite never
returning to junior high,

00:15:21.671 --> 00:15:24.382 position:50% align:center
I was allowed to
go to high school.

00:15:24.466 --> 00:15:26.634 position:50% align:center
What was even stranger

00:15:26.718 --> 00:15:29.304 position:50% align:center
was the day he came over.

[MIYUKI]
In other words,

00:15:49.157 --> 00:15:51.242 position:50% align:center
you elected not to refute him

00:15:51.326 --> 00:15:55.121 position:50% align:center
because you were concerned
for Kyoko Otomo's wellbeing.

00:15:55.205 --> 00:15:56.581 position:50% align:center
That's the conclusion I came to

00:15:56.664 --> 00:15:59.793 position:50% align:center
based on the fragments
of intel we could gather.

00:15:59.876 --> 00:16:01.169 position:50% align:center
What's more,

00:16:01.252 --> 00:16:04.381 position:50% align:center
I'm not the only one who
agrees with these findings.

00:16:04.464 --> 00:16:06.966 position:50% align:center
Upon further investigation,

00:16:07.050 --> 00:16:09.552 position:50% align:center

Otomo transferred
to a different school,

00:16:15.266 --> 00:16:18.353 position:50% align:center
and she seems to be
getting along just fine.

00:16:18.436 --> 00:16:20.897 position:50% align:center

[YU gasps]

00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:30.323 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI] Apparently, you
made Ogino rather paranoid.

00:16:30.407 --> 00:16:32.325 position:50% align:center
Even after months of suspension,

00:16:32.409 --> 00:16:34.828 position:50% align:center
you refused to submit
a letter of apology.

00:16:34.911 --> 00:16:37.455 position:50% align:center
You were a ticking
timebomb to him.

00:16:37.539 --> 00:16:39.332 position:50% align:center
Unintentionally or not,

00:16:39.416 --> 00:16:43.461 position:50% align:center
your silence and
stubbornness were effective.

00:16:43.545 --> 00:16:46.631 position:50% align:center
Let's not debate the
righteousness of your actions.

00:16:46.715 --> 00:16:48.883 position:50% align:center
You definitely could've
been smarter about it,

00:16:48.967 --> 00:16:50.635 position:50% align:center
there's no doubt.

00:16:50.719 --> 00:16:51.970 position:50% align:center
That said,

It felt like it would
crush me, but then...

00:17:05.483 --> 00:17:07.610 position:50% align:center
...he lifted it away
like it was nothing.

you realize that, Ishigami.
