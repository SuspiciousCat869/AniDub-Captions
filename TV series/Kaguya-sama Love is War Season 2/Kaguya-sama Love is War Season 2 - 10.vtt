This, ladies and gentlemen,

00:00:20.562 --> 00:00:23.356 position:50% align:center
is what a nervous
breakdown looks like

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:27.569 position:50% align:center

is avoiding you like the plague.

[NARRATOR] Even his sister

00:00:39.873 --> 00:00:43.418 position:50% align:center
I mean, petal-picking
is a pretty dead giveaway.

00:00:43.501 --> 00:00:44.669 position:50% align:center
Hey. What's up?

00:00:44.753 --> 00:00:46.338 position:50% align:center
[KEI grunts]

00:00:49.966 --> 00:00:51.509 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR]
But, she chooses to ignore it

00:00:51.593 --> 00:00:55.055 position:50% align:center
and acts as if she doesn't care,
resisting the temptation to

00:00:55.138 --> 00:00:58.767 position:50% align:center
grill him for all the
nitty-gritty details.

00:01:00.143 --> 00:01:03.897 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR] Why, you ask?
Because Kei Shirogane

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:07.067 position:50% align:center
is a mother flippin' <i>tsundere</i> !

00:02:37.157 --> 00:02:38.867 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI]
C'mon, Kei.

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:40.493 position:50% align:center
I thought you said you
weren't gonna drink juice

00:02:40.577 --> 00:02:42.662 position:50% align:center

00:02:42.746 --> 00:02:44.205 position:50% align:center

[MIYUKI, PAPA SHIROGANE] Munch,
munch. Munch, munch, munch.

Stop being so picky and
eat your green peppers.

00:02:55.633 --> 00:02:58.345 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI] That was fast. Did you
scarf down your manners, too,

00:02:58.428 --> 00:02:59.846 position:50% align:center
or did you just
forget to say thank you

00:02:59.929 --> 00:03:00.764 position:50% align:center
and put your dishes in the--?

00:03:00.847 --> 00:03:02.724 position:50% align:center

[NARRATOR]
The Shirogane Family!

00:03:04.684 --> 00:03:06.394 position:50% align:center
The father doesn't
have a steady job

00:03:06.478 --> 00:03:08.355 position:50% align:center
and they live in
a 50,000 yen apartment

00:03:08.438 --> 00:03:11.232 position:50% align:center
that's a 20-minute walk
from Sangenjaya Station.

00:03:11.316 --> 00:03:14.736 position:50% align:center
There was a Missus Shirogane,
but she ran off with her lover.

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:16.154 position:50% align:center
The father's factory going bust

00:03:16.237 --> 00:03:18.615 position:50% align:center
was the icing on this
crappy cake of events.

00:03:18.698 --> 00:03:19.908 position:50% align:center
On top of their hardships,

00:03:19.991 --> 00:03:21.868 position:50% align:center
Kei feels her
overprotective big brother

00:03:21.951 --> 00:03:23.536 position:50% align:center
treats her like a little kid.

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:24.913 position:50% align:center
You're not walking out of
this apartment till you...

00:03:24.996 --> 00:03:26.456 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR] And the more
she pushes him away,

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:28.249 position:50% align:center
the louder he seems to nag.

00:03:28.333 --> 00:03:30.752 position:50% align:center
Nag, nag, nag, nag, nag, nag!

00:03:30.835 --> 00:03:32.504 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR]
Thus, their communication

00:03:32.587 --> 00:03:35.298 position:50% align:center
is in a continuous
downward spiral!

00:03:35.382 --> 00:03:37.050 position:50% align:center
But now that Kei
is dying to know

00:03:37.133 --> 00:03:39.386 position:50% align:center
the details of her
brother's romantic life,

00:03:39.469 --> 00:03:42.597 position:50% align:center
her curiosity is slowly
eating away at her.

00:03:42.681 --> 00:03:44.933 position:50% align:center
She can't be obvious
about it, though.

00:03:45.016 --> 00:03:47.644 position:50% align:center
What? I wanna hear
everything there is to tell!

00:03:47.727 --> 00:03:49.437 position:50% align:center
I mean this girl could
be my sister-in-law!

00:03:49.521 --> 00:03:52.941 position:50% align:center
Tell me! Tell me! Tell me!
Tell me! Tell me! Tell me!

00:03:53.024 --> 00:03:54.275 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR]
To appear too concerned

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:55.944 position:50% align:center
is simply out of the question.

00:03:56.027 --> 00:03:57.779 position:50% align:center
She doesn't need that
kind of humiliation.

00:03:57.862 --> 00:03:59.614 position:50% align:center
So how can she force
her brother to dish

00:03:59.698 --> 00:04:01.741 position:50% align:center
while maintaining
her aloof persona?

00:04:01.825 --> 00:04:05.328 position:50% align:center
Her brother isn't the only
one in the family with brains.

00:04:05.412 --> 00:04:07.706 position:50% align:center
[KEI]
What's this?

00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:09.332 position:50% align:center
Picking petals?

00:04:09.416 --> 00:04:10.333 position:50% align:center
That's creepy.

00:04:10.417 --> 00:04:13.586 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR]
The verbal abuse tactic!

[MIYUKI grunts]

00:04:14.546 --> 00:04:16.339 position:50% align:center
You must be brokenhearted.

00:04:16.423 --> 00:04:19.384 position:50% align:center
So how exactly did she dump you?

00:04:19.467 --> 00:04:20.885 position:50% align:center
Just leave me alone.

What's this?

00:04:39.946 --> 00:04:43.366 position:50% align:center
So, do you have a crush
on someone, Miyuki?

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:47.078 position:50% align:center
I don't. It's not
like that at all.

00:04:47.162 --> 00:04:48.371 position:50% align:center
[PAPA SHIROGANE]
Sure.

00:04:48.455 --> 00:04:49.956 position:50% align:center
Wanna talk it out?

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:53.084 position:50% align:center
A major part of being a father
is listening to your children.

00:04:53.168 --> 00:04:54.753 position:50% align:center
Tell sugar daddy what's wrong.

yourself that ever again.

Fine. I guess I'll tell you.

00:05:01.092 --> 00:05:03.887 position:50% align:center
I thought things were going
pretty well with this one girl,

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:07.015 position:50% align:center
but she's been
avoiding me recently.

00:05:07.098 --> 00:05:08.433 position:50% align:center

I also noticed she's been acting

00:05:08.516 --> 00:05:11.770 position:50% align:center
more friendly than usual
with this other guy I know.

00:05:11.853 --> 00:05:14.272 position:50% align:center
Did she start hating
me for some reason?

00:05:14.356 --> 00:05:16.441 position:50% align:center
I have no clue
how she's feeling.

00:05:18.818 --> 00:05:20.362 position:50% align:center

with a younger man these days.

there's still a possibility
that she likes you.

What makes you say that?

00:06:09.119 --> 00:06:10.453 position:50% align:center
[KEI]
'Cause if she likes you,

the thought of having
a normal conversation with you

00:06:12.455 --> 00:06:14.332 position:50% align:center

[MIYUKI] I can see how
coaching me would be stressful.

But I can still do this,
even without her.

00:09:40.413 --> 00:09:42.123 position:50% align:center

[KAGUYA] Hey, there. Practicing
the dance for the festival?

00:09:47.087 --> 00:09:49.673 position:50% align:center
You know, I'm no expert, but
I can give you some pointers.

00:09:49.756 --> 00:09:52.008 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA]
And I get to touch him!

00:09:52.092 --> 00:09:53.009 position:50% align:center
Really?

00:09:53.093 --> 00:09:54.552 position:50% align:center
Of course.

00:09:54.636 --> 00:09:57.889 position:50% align:center
Take the "throw it out"
part for example.

00:09:57.972 --> 00:09:59.766 position:50% align:center
Now, puff out your chest.

00:09:59.849 --> 00:10:02.352 position:50% align:center
And take your hips and
lower them down like this.

00:10:02.435 --> 00:10:04.521 position:50% align:center
It looks much better this way.

00:10:04.604 --> 00:10:05.980 position:50% align:center
Uh-huh.

00:10:06.064 --> 00:10:08.608 position:50% align:center
Also...

00:10:08.692 --> 00:10:09.943 position:50% align:center

[MIYUKI]
I get the feeling you're upset.

00:10:29.087 --> 00:10:30.672 position:50% align:center
[CHIKA]
Why would I be upset?

00:10:30.755 --> 00:10:33.174 position:50% align:center
I mean, the ridiculous speed in
which you changed teachers

00:10:33.258 --> 00:10:35.635 position:50% align:center
is something to marvel at,
not get upset about.

00:10:35.719 --> 00:10:38.680 position:50% align:center
By all means, continue.

00:10:38.763 --> 00:10:40.557 position:50% align:center
Dance is a series
of beautiful poses

00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:43.101 position:50% align:center
that flow from one
move to the next.

00:10:43.184 --> 00:10:45.603 position:50% align:center
Each move should be made
with a purpose in mind.

00:10:45.687 --> 00:10:47.981 position:50% align:center
She doesn't get it at all.

00:10:48.064 --> 00:10:50.191 position:50% align:center
Yes, Fujiwara? Do you
have something to add?

00:10:50.275 --> 00:10:52.027 position:50% align:center
No, no, you keep going.

00:10:52.110 --> 00:10:54.029 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA]
Even your fingers play a part.

00:10:54.112 --> 00:10:57.449 position:50% align:center
So, if you copy the choreography
right down to the fingertips--

00:10:57.532 --> 00:11:00.744 position:50% align:center
A copycat? How nice.

00:11:00.827 --> 00:11:02.245 position:50% align:center
That's twice now.

00:11:02.328 --> 00:11:05.040 position:50% align:center
If you have a problem with
the way I teach, simply say so.

00:11:05.123 --> 00:11:06.916 position:50% align:center
I don't, but...

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.919 position:50% align:center
...you can't deny the raw
feeling of the soran dance.

00:11:10.003 --> 00:11:14.507 position:50% align:center
Definitely not something
you can just copy, right?

00:11:14.591 --> 00:11:16.176 position:50% align:center
If you don't give it
your heart and soul,

00:11:16.259 --> 00:11:18.428 position:50% align:center
it turns out all wrong, right?

00:11:18.511 --> 00:11:20.305 position:50% align:center
The term "heart and
soul" is quite vague

00:11:20.388 --> 00:11:21.890 position:50% align:center
and shouldn't apply to dancing.

00:11:21.973 --> 00:11:23.683 position:50% align:center
What's key is memorizing
the choreography

00:11:23.767 --> 00:11:25.977 position:50% align:center
and training one's body
to efficiently do it.

00:11:26.061 --> 00:11:28.063 position:50% align:center
[CHIKA gasps]

00:11:28.146 --> 00:11:29.647 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA] Dancers can't
convey the intentions

behind the moves
to the audience.

00:11:31.441 --> 00:11:32.901 position:50% align:center
What winds up translating

00:11:32.984 --> 00:11:35.612 position:50% align:center
is the beautiful performance
if everything is executed well.

00:11:35.695 --> 00:11:37.739 position:50% align:center
[CHIKA]
You're so wrong!

00:11:37.822 --> 00:11:39.616 position:50% align:center
Though presentation is key,

00:11:39.699 --> 00:11:41.993 position:50% align:center
if it doesn't have love,
then nobody's happy!

fun of expressing himself,

00:11:45.747 --> 00:11:47.165 position:50% align:center
or completely butt out!
