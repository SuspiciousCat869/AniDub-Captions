00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:45.689 position:50% align:center
Party time! Full moon
tonight! Woo-hoo!

00:01:45.772 --> 00:01:47.023 position:50% align:center
I like the enthusiasm,

00:01:47.107 --> 00:01:49.526 position:50% align:center
but I don't see why
you're getting so worked up.

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:53.988 position:50% align:center
That's exactly how I feel
every time you open your mouth.

00:01:54.072 --> 00:01:55.824 position:50% align:center
It's the night
of the harvest moon.

00:01:55.907 --> 00:01:57.033 position:50% align:center
Those who fail to observe it

00:01:57.117 --> 00:01:59.369 position:50% align:center
are wasting the
chance of a lifetime!

00:01:59.452 --> 00:02:00.870 position:50% align:center
I thought of
everything we'll need.

00:02:00.954 --> 00:02:02.831 position:50% align:center
I even got permission
to use the roof.

00:02:02.914 --> 00:02:05.375 position:50% align:center
So call your parents and
tell them not to wait up for ya!

00:02:05.458 --> 00:02:06.876 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.503 position:50% align:center
This is so random, though.

00:02:08.586 --> 00:02:10.922 position:50% align:center
What? There's nothing random
about the phases of the moon,

00:02:11.006 --> 00:02:14.134 position:50% align:center
and tonight's forecast is ideal
for stargazing, so we gotta!

00:02:14.217 --> 00:02:15.552 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR]
Ah. Moon-viewing.

00:02:15.635 --> 00:02:17.721 position:50% align:center
Shirogane dreams
of being an astronomer.

00:02:17.804 --> 00:02:20.056 position:50% align:center
His love for celestial
bodies burns as brightly

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:21.766 position:50% align:center
as the stars themselves.

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:23.268 position:50% align:center
This is the one
night of the year

00:02:23.351 --> 00:02:24.978 position:50% align:center
when the moon's
beauty reaches its peak.

00:02:25.061 --> 00:02:28.314 position:50% align:center
So, yeah, he's a little excited.

00:02:28.398 --> 00:02:30.233 position:50% align:center
Sounds kinda fun to me.

00:02:30.316 --> 00:02:31.943 position:50% align:center
Let's go ahead and humor him.

00:02:32.027 --> 00:02:34.863 position:50% align:center
The council will be
disbanded soon enough.

00:02:34.946 --> 00:02:37.073 position:50% align:center
Gotta cherish the
time we still have.

00:02:37.157 --> 00:02:39.200 position:50% align:center
'Cause it'll be gone
before we know it.

00:02:39.284 --> 00:02:40.827 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI, CHIKA grunt]

00:02:44.914 --> 00:02:47.000 position:50% align:center
[CHIKA]
Wow!

00:02:47.083 --> 00:02:49.502 position:50% align:center
That's one big, beautiful moon!

00:02:49.586 --> 00:02:53.214 position:50% align:center
Yeah. It's currently
southeast, facing Tokyo Bay,

00:02:53.298 --> 00:02:55.925 position:50% align:center
so there aren't too
many lights to obscure it.

00:02:56.009 --> 00:02:57.427 position:50% align:center
We picked a great spot.

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:58.636 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA]
I don't get it.

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.555 position:50% align:center
What's so great about
looking at the moon?

00:03:00.638 --> 00:03:03.600 position:50% align:center
Not like it's gonna fall
out of the sky or something.

00:03:03.683 --> 00:03:06.227 position:50% align:center
But sharing a rooftop
view like this

00:03:06.311 --> 00:03:09.064 position:50% align:center
will provide a certain
romantic ambiance.

00:03:09.147 --> 00:03:12.859 position:50% align:center
I can use that to my advantage
and make the president confess.

00:03:12.942 --> 00:03:14.736 position:50% align:center
I just have to lose
the audience first.

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:16.112 position:50% align:center
[CHIKA] It's rice cakes,
for Pete's sake!

00:03:16.196 --> 00:03:17.489 position:50% align:center
Cold.

00:03:17.572 --> 00:03:20.283 position:50% align:center
Hey, Fujiwara. Are you
going to boil the rice cakes?

00:03:20.367 --> 00:03:21.868 position:50% align:center
Yup!

00:03:21.951 --> 00:03:24.329 position:50% align:center
Don't tell the president, but I
came for these, not the moon.

00:03:24.412 --> 00:03:27.040 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA] It's a little
too windy over here, though.

00:03:27.123 --> 00:03:28.667 position:50% align:center
Let's move it to be safe.

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:30.543 position:50% align:center
[CHIKA]
Good thinkin'!

00:03:30.627 --> 00:03:33.129 position:50% align:center
[YU] I got a sudden chill, so
I'm gonna warm up by the fire.

00:03:33.213 --> 00:03:35.507 position:50% align:center
[CHIKA]
Rice cakes!

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:37.175 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA]
That was really easy.

00:03:37.258 --> 00:03:39.761 position:50% align:center
It's nice when things work out.

00:03:39.844 --> 00:03:41.971 position:50% align:center
Uh, hey. Where'd
the other two go?

00:03:42.055 --> 00:03:44.766 position:50% align:center
They're boiling rice cakes
in a place with less wind.

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:46.476 position:50% align:center
That's nice.

00:03:46.559 --> 00:03:48.978 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA]
Now, how shall I attack?

00:03:49.062 --> 00:03:51.606 position:50% align:center
Ah, yes. I think I have an idea.

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:54.693 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA sneezes]
So cold.

00:03:54.776 --> 00:03:58.446 position:50% align:center
I'm glad I'm here, but if I'd
known about this plan sooner,

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:00.782 position:50% align:center
I would've thought
to bring a jacket.

00:04:00.865 --> 00:04:03.159 position:50% align:center
I'll probably catch a cold
before tonight's over.

00:04:03.243 --> 00:04:04.494 position:50% align:center
Uh, take this.

00:04:04.577 --> 00:04:06.413 position:50% align:center
I think you need
it more than me.

00:04:06.496 --> 00:04:08.415 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA] That's it!
Seeing the president squirm

00:04:08.498 --> 00:04:09.708 position:50% align:center
is going to be
much more entertaining

00:04:09.791 --> 00:04:12.752 position:50% align:center
than watching
a hunk of space rock.

00:04:12.836 --> 00:04:15.797 position:50% align:center
You know, I'm glad
I'm here, but...

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:19.009 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI]
You must be freezing.

00:04:19.092 --> 00:04:21.094 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA gasps]

00:04:23.722 --> 00:04:27.183 position:50% align:center
You can wear my
jacket until we leave.

00:04:27.267 --> 00:04:30.228 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA]
Wait. What?!

00:04:30.311 --> 00:04:32.814 position:50% align:center
How did this happen?
I never even prompted him,

00:04:32.897 --> 00:04:35.066 position:50% align:center
yet here I am with
his jacket around me!

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:38.319 position:50% align:center
I wanted to watch him squirm,
but he didn't so much as flinch!

00:04:38.403 --> 00:04:41.072 position:50% align:center
I also brought hot tea
to help keep us warm.

00:04:41.156 --> 00:04:42.782 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA gasps]

00:04:42.866 --> 00:04:43.867 position:50% align:center
Thanks.

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:45.326 position:50% align:center
Seems like you
thought of everything.

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:48.079 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA]
Oh! Why hello, plan B!

00:04:48.163 --> 00:04:50.582 position:50% align:center
This appears to be the only
cup he brought for the tea.

00:04:50.665 --> 00:04:52.709 position:50% align:center
Which means I'll get to
see him completely flustered

00:04:52.792 --> 00:04:55.045 position:50% align:center
over the prospect
of an indirect kiss!

00:04:55.128 --> 00:04:57.422 position:50% align:center
Why don't you have some, too?

00:04:57.505 --> 00:04:58.340 position:50% align:center
Okay.

00:04:58.423 --> 00:04:59.424 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA]
Here it comes!

00:04:59.507 --> 00:05:02.260 position:50% align:center
I wonder how red
his blush is gonna be.

00:05:02.344 --> 00:05:04.304 position:50% align:center
No way!

00:05:04.387 --> 00:05:06.181 position:50% align:center
What the heck are you doing?

00:05:06.264 --> 00:05:08.433 position:50% align:center
I had my mouth on that
less than ten seconds ago!

00:05:08.516 --> 00:05:09.726 position:50% align:center
But you're just sipping away

00:05:09.809 --> 00:05:12.812 position:50% align:center
like a secondhand kiss
means absolutely nothing!

00:05:12.896 --> 00:05:14.773 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA gasps]
Oh, no.

00:05:14.856 --> 00:05:17.275 position:50% align:center
He's so obsessed with the
moon I'm not even in his orbit!

00:05:17.359 --> 00:05:18.693 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR]
Nailed it!

00:05:18.777 --> 00:05:21.071 position:50% align:center
The full moon has a strong
pull on Shirogane's heart!

00:05:21.154 --> 00:05:23.365 position:50% align:center
His mind has reverted
to a state of childlike

00:05:23.448 --> 00:05:25.408 position:50% align:center
innocence devoid
of indecent thoughts!

00:05:25.492 --> 00:05:26.951 position:50% align:center
All trappings, warped pride,

00:05:27.035 --> 00:05:29.371 position:50% align:center
and sense of shame have
been cast to the wayside!

00:05:29.454 --> 00:05:32.457 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA] More infatuated
with the moon than me?

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:34.876 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA laughs]
No.

00:05:34.959 --> 00:05:37.253 position:50% align:center
I refuse to go
down without a fight!

00:05:37.337 --> 00:05:38.838 position:50% align:center
They say nothing
pleases a man more

00:05:38.922 --> 00:05:41.299 position:50% align:center
than when a woman expresses
an interest in his interests!

00:05:41.383 --> 00:05:42.634 position:50% align:center
In which case...

00:05:42.717 --> 00:05:43.885 position:50% align:center
All these stars,

00:05:43.968 --> 00:05:46.262 position:50% align:center
but how do you find the
Great Square of Pegasus?

00:05:46.346 --> 00:05:51.976 position:50% align:center
You're into space,
too? I never realized.

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:53.311 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA]
I'll smile and nod

00:05:53.395 --> 00:05:55.730 position:50% align:center
and pretend to be interested
in what he's saying.

00:05:55.814 --> 00:05:58.983 position:50% align:center
You never cease to amaze me
with how knowledgeable you are!

00:05:59.067 --> 00:06:00.443 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA] Then I'll
naturally lean into him

00:06:00.527 --> 00:06:01.986 position:50% align:center
and he'll squirm
like a little worm!

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:03.863 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI] Keep it together, Keep
it together, Keep it together!

00:06:03.947 --> 00:06:05.323 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA]
All these stars.

00:06:05.407 --> 00:06:07.784 position:50% align:center
But how do you find the
Great Square of Pegasus?

00:06:07.867 --> 00:06:09.744 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI]
Are you actually interested?

00:06:09.828 --> 00:06:11.413 position:50% align:center
Yes. You surprised?

00:06:11.496 --> 00:06:13.039 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI] Then slide
closer and I'll show you.

00:06:13.123 --> 00:06:14.541 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA gasps]

00:06:14.624 --> 00:06:15.458 position:50% align:center
Okay.

00:06:15.542 --> 00:06:18.962 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA]
Is-- Is he serious?

00:06:19.045 --> 00:06:20.296 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI] You see that bright
star?

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:22.924 position:50% align:center
That right there is Alpheratz.

00:06:23.008 --> 00:06:25.719 position:50% align:center
We're able to see the Great
Square of Pegasus in the fall,

00:06:25.802 --> 00:06:29.139 position:50% align:center
but, ironically, its brightest
star is part of Andromeda.

00:06:29.222 --> 00:06:31.725 position:50% align:center
The other three bright ones
are a part of Pegasus though,

00:06:31.808 --> 00:06:35.562 position:50% align:center
and if you connect all four,
it becomes a square.

00:06:35.645 --> 00:06:36.438 position:50% align:center
Do you see it?

00:06:36.521 --> 00:06:37.522 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry.

00:06:37.605 --> 00:06:39.816 position:50% align:center
The moon's a little
too distracting.

00:06:39.899 --> 00:06:41.067 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI]
True.

00:06:41.151 --> 00:06:42.861 position:50% align:center
Then let's try something else.

00:06:42.944 --> 00:06:43.945 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA squeals]

00:06:44.029 --> 00:06:45.030 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI]
You'll see the Summer Triangle

00:06:45.113 --> 00:06:47.240 position:50% align:center
if you lie down
and look straight up.

00:06:47.323 --> 00:06:49.993 position:50% align:center
It's clearly visible even
though it's already autumn.

00:06:50.076 --> 00:06:51.077 position:50% align:center
I find that funny.

00:06:51.161 --> 00:06:51.911 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA gasping]

00:06:51.995 --> 00:06:53.329 position:50% align:center
Come to think of it,

00:06:53.413 --> 00:06:54.831 position:50% align:center
do you know about the
temporal axis lag, by chance?

00:06:54.914 --> 00:06:56.541 position:50% align:center
The North Star
changes over time.

00:06:56.624 --> 00:06:58.335 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA]
He's totally lost his grip!

00:06:58.418 --> 00:06:59.669 position:50% align:center
Well, not the one he has on me.

00:06:59.753 --> 00:07:03.214 position:50% align:center
But the one he had on
reality is out the window!

00:07:03.298 --> 00:07:05.800 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI] So that means,
Hikoboshi will revolve around

00:07:05.884 --> 00:07:07.761 position:50% align:center
Orihime 10,000 years from now.

00:07:07.844 --> 00:07:09.804 position:50% align:center
Y'know, the story of
Orihime is derived from...

00:07:09.888 --> 00:07:11.348 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA]
The only stars I can focus on

00:07:11.431 --> 00:07:14.017 position:50% align:center
when he talks like that
are the ones in his eyes!

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:16.311 position:50% align:center
...a man will always
revolve around a woman.

00:07:16.394 --> 00:07:17.395 position:50% align:center
Isn't that funny?

00:07:17.479 --> 00:07:20.940 position:50% align:center
Wow. That was very informative.

00:07:21.024 --> 00:07:23.318 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI]
Speaking of stories,

00:07:23.401 --> 00:07:25.987 position:50% align:center
the moon reminds me
of "Princess Kaguya."

00:07:26.071 --> 00:07:27.781 position:50% align:center
Do you think of that, too?

00:07:27.864 --> 00:07:29.240 position:50% align:center
Since you share the same name.

00:07:29.324 --> 00:07:30.867 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:07:34.162 --> 00:07:35.872 position:50% align:center
Yes, I do.

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:39.167 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA] Every time
I look up at the night sky,

00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:41.127 position:50% align:center
I can't help but remember
the story of a woman

00:07:41.211 --> 00:07:43.380 position:50% align:center
who was forced to
return home to the moon

That's why I hate the moon.

00:07:53.473 --> 00:07:55.600 position:50% align:center
Makes sense.

00:07:55.684 --> 00:07:58.353 position:50% align:center
Before Princess
Kaguya left Earth,

00:07:58.436 --> 00:08:02.107 position:50% align:center
she gave the man she loved
an elixir of immortality.

00:08:02.190 --> 00:08:04.609 position:50% align:center
But he had no intention
of living forever

00:08:04.693 --> 00:08:06.736 position:50% align:center
in a world without her,

00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:10.365 position:50% align:center
so in the end he
destroyed her parting gift.

00:08:10.448 --> 00:08:12.867 position:50% align:center
But if you ask me,
Princess Kaguya

00:08:12.951 --> 00:08:16.913 position:50% align:center
did everything she could to
reject her other suitors.

00:08:16.996 --> 00:08:18.289 position:50% align:center
A woman like that wouldn't want

00:08:18.373 --> 00:08:21.960 position:50% align:center
the love of her life to
spend eternity without her.

00:08:22.043 --> 00:08:23.586 position:50% align:center
How could she?

00:08:23.670 --> 00:08:25.338 position:50% align:center
They went through so much.

00:08:25.422 --> 00:08:29.509 position:50% align:center
I like to imagine that elixir
was more than just a gift.

00:08:29.592 --> 00:08:33.430 position:50% align:center
It was a message...
saying she'd come back.

00:08:33.513 --> 00:08:36.266 position:50% align:center
Even if it took longer
than a human lifespan.

00:08:36.349 --> 00:08:39.936 position:50% align:center
And even if the distance between
them was impossible to bridge.

00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:42.480 position:50% align:center
I honestly believe
it was her saying.

00:08:42.564 --> 00:08:45.108 position:50% align:center
"Please, wait for me."

00:08:45.191 --> 00:08:46.776 position:50% align:center
But he missed it.

00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:50.739 position:50% align:center
And so he wound up watching
his last chance to be with her

00:08:50.822 --> 00:08:52.949 position:50% align:center
go up in flames.

00:08:53.033 --> 00:08:55.201 position:50% align:center
It's a cruel story.

00:08:57.078 --> 00:08:58.747 position:50% align:center
If I had been in his shoes,

00:08:58.830 --> 00:09:00.415 position:50% align:center

00:16:02.253 --> 00:16:03.463 position:50% align:center
At least the burden of this cord

00:16:03.546 --> 00:16:05.924 position:50% align:center
won't be weighing
me down. It was heavy.

00:16:06.007 --> 00:16:08.176 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA]
Well, it is made out of gold.

00:16:08.259 --> 00:16:11.680 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI sighs] Nothing left
to do except hope and pray

00:16:11.763 --> 00:16:13.682 position:50% align:center
our successors can fill our
shoes.

00:16:13.765 --> 00:16:16.810 position:50% align:center
[CHIKA] Hmm. They're gonna
need some mighty big feet, then.

00:16:16.893 --> 00:16:20.063 position:50% align:center
You put in so much work,
I doubt anyone wants your spot.

00:16:20.146 --> 00:16:22.816 position:50% align:center
Well, all that hard work
pays off in the long run!

00:16:22.899 --> 00:16:24.609 position:50% align:center
Being president is tough,

00:16:24.693 --> 00:16:26.277 position:50% align:center
but there are some
solid perks to it.

00:16:26.361 --> 00:16:28.571 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR]
Student Council privileges!

00:16:28.655 --> 00:16:31.324 position:50% align:center
Members of Shuchiin Academy's
committee and Student Council

00:16:31.408 --> 00:16:33.535 position:50% align:center
are given privileges
such as admittance to

00:16:33.618 --> 00:16:37.080 position:50% align:center
Shuchiin University, grant
qualifications, and the like.

00:16:37.163 --> 00:16:38.832 position:50% align:center
But only the Student
Council President

00:16:38.915 --> 00:16:40.583 position:50% align:center
receives a letter of
recommendation from

00:16:40.667 --> 00:16:42.460 position:50% align:center
the academy's
board of trustees--

00:16:42.544 --> 00:16:45.463 position:50% align:center
a golden ticket to
universities worldwide.

00:16:45.547 --> 00:16:47.590 position:50% align:center
Such a stellar
recommendation is the perfect

00:16:47.674 --> 00:16:51.720 position:50% align:center
stepping stone towards making a
student's dreams come true.

00:16:51.803 --> 00:16:54.639 position:50% align:center
What about you? Wanna
throw your hat in the ring?

00:16:54.723 --> 00:16:58.018 position:50% align:center
[YU chuckles] Maybe if I
thought I'd actually win.

00:16:58.101 --> 00:17:00.103 position:50% align:center
No one at school would
give me their vote.

00:17:00.186 --> 00:17:03.064 position:50% align:center
Girls cry just from making
eye contact with me.

00:17:03.148 --> 00:17:05.150 position:50% align:center
Like, who's cutting
onions in here, y'know?

00:17:05.233 --> 00:17:07.652 position:50% align:center
And when they start crying,
I start crying.

00:17:07.736 --> 00:17:10.280 position:50% align:center
[YU laughs] It's like
we're having a "cry," sis!

00:17:10.363 --> 00:17:11.740 position:50% align:center
Sorry.

00:17:11.823 --> 00:17:13.658 position:50% align:center
Picture this, you guys.

00:17:13.742 --> 00:17:17.120 position:50% align:center
What if I became
Student Council president?

00:17:17.203 --> 00:17:18.163 position:50% align:center
[CHIKA chuckles]

00:17:18.246 --> 00:17:19.956 position:50% align:center
[ALL laugh]

00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:23.084 position:50% align:center
Knock it off. I'll
punch you in the face.

00:17:23.168 --> 00:17:24.586 position:50% align:center
So then, President.

00:17:24.669 --> 00:17:27.630 position:50% align:center
Whoever could you mean? I wasn't
president last I checked.

00:17:27.714 --> 00:17:31.009 position:50% align:center
Oh. Guess that's true.

00:17:31.092 --> 00:17:33.720 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA] But... if President
isn't the president,

00:17:33.803 --> 00:17:34.846 position:50% align:center
what should I call him?

00:17:34.929 --> 00:17:35.805 position:50% align:center
[YU yelps]

00:17:35.889 --> 00:17:37.182 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA]
Shirogane?

00:17:37.265 --> 00:17:41.186 position:50% align:center
I feel like maybe we're
closer than that, so maybe.

00:17:41.269 --> 00:17:42.937 position:50% align:center
Mi...

00:17:43.021 --> 00:17:44.773 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA]
Miyuki.

00:17:46.983 --> 00:17:49.027 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA]
Ugh, yeah, right.

00:17:49.110 --> 00:17:51.029 position:50% align:center
Calling him by his first
name is an embarrassment

00:17:51.112 --> 00:17:53.573 position:50% align:center
I'd rather not
endure if possible.

00:17:53.656 --> 00:17:56.618 position:50% align:center
Only foolish girls would
act that familiar with a boy.

00:17:56.701 --> 00:17:58.870 position:50% align:center
Hey, looks like you
need a refill, Miyuki!

00:17:58.995 --> 00:17:59.996 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA gasps]

00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:01.456 position:50% align:center
[CHIKA]
You had coffee, right, Miyuki?

00:18:01.539 --> 00:18:02.957 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA shrieks]

00:18:03.041 --> 00:18:05.543 position:50% align:center
Did you want hot coffee or
iced coffee this time, Miyuki?

00:18:05.627 --> 00:18:06.378 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA groans]

00:18:06.461 --> 00:18:07.962 position:50% align:center
Iced would be great.

00:18:08.046 --> 00:18:10.674 position:50% align:center
'Kay. I'll get it
for you, Miyuki!

00:18:10.757 --> 00:18:13.802 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA] Unbelievable!
Was she raised in a barn?!

00:18:13.885 --> 00:18:16.346 position:50% align:center
If it's cool, I'll take
the same thing as Myu.

00:18:16.429 --> 00:18:18.348 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA]
Myu?!

00:18:18.431 --> 00:18:19.933 position:50% align:center
Where'd that name
even come from?!

00:18:20.016 --> 00:18:22.268 position:50% align:center
I guess it makes sense if you
take the "I" out of "Miyu."

00:18:22.352 --> 00:18:25.355 position:50% align:center
That's so cute!

00:18:25.438 --> 00:18:27.607 position:50% align:center
It didn't occur to me
to call him a nickname.

00:18:27.691 --> 00:18:28.817 position:50% align:center
Calling him by his given name

00:18:28.900 --> 00:18:30.902 position:50% align:center
would make me sound
like an airheaded bimbo.

00:18:30.985 --> 00:18:33.947 position:50% align:center
But if it's a nickname,
then there's no problem!

00:18:34.823 --> 00:18:36.533 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA]
How are you today, Mister Myu?

00:18:36.616 --> 00:18:37.742 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI]
"Mister"?

00:18:37.826 --> 00:18:38.827 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA] I wouldn't
feel embarrassed by this

00:18:38.910 --> 00:18:41.287 position:50% align:center
in the slightest!
Nickname it is!

00:18:41.371 --> 00:18:43.915 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna go grab
another drink as well.

00:18:43.998 --> 00:18:45.250 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI grunts]

00:18:45.333 --> 00:18:48.003 position:50% align:center
Did you say you
liked iced coffee?

00:18:49.838 --> 00:18:52.549 position:50% align:center
Mi... Uhh...

00:18:52.632 --> 00:18:53.800 position:50% align:center
President.

00:18:53.883 --> 00:18:57.303 position:50% align:center
Saying it like a pirate
doesn't make it okay.

00:18:57.387 --> 00:18:59.639 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR]
A for effort though, Kag.

00:19:01.808 --> 00:19:03.601 position:50% align:center
[CHIKA]
I hate that we have to disband.

00:19:03.685 --> 00:19:05.979 position:50% align:center
If Miyuki would agree to
be Student Council president

00:19:06.062 --> 00:19:08.857 position:50% align:center
for one more year, everything
would turn out perfectly!

00:19:08.940 --> 00:19:10.692 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA]
He won't.

00:19:10.775 --> 00:19:13.820 position:50% align:center
That title comes with
an exhausting amount of work.

00:19:13.903 --> 00:19:16.531 position:50% align:center
He had too much on his plate
when he was the president.

00:19:16.614 --> 00:19:18.450 position:50% align:center
What he needs is a break.

00:19:18.533 --> 00:19:21.536 position:50% align:center
Plus, he already has the coveted
letter of recommendation.

00:19:21.619 --> 00:19:25.123 position:50% align:center
So there really isn't
any incentive for him.

00:19:25.206 --> 00:19:27.292 position:50% align:center
We can't be selfish.

00:19:29.919 --> 00:19:31.671 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA]
That's right.

00:19:31.755 --> 00:19:36.134 position:50% align:center
We have to consider what
he wants, not what we want.

00:19:43.183 --> 00:19:44.976 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA]
We're in different classes.

00:19:45.060 --> 00:19:48.521 position:50% align:center
Student Council was the
only thing connecting us.

00:19:48.605 --> 00:19:52.484 position:50% align:center
We probably won't see each other
very often after tonight.

00:19:53.860 --> 00:19:55.278 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:19:55.362 --> 00:19:56.363 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA]
I suppose I could always

00:19:56.446 --> 00:19:58.281 position:50% align:center
become the Student
Council president!

00:19:58.365 --> 00:20:00.492 position:50% align:center
He and I could just swap roles!

00:20:00.575 --> 00:20:03.828 position:50% align:center
We'll get Ishigami to stay on
as the treasurer, of course!

00:20:03.912 --> 00:20:07.165 position:50% align:center
And Kashiwagi could
be the secretary!

00:20:07.248 --> 00:20:10.293 position:50% align:center
I can't imagine
a more perfect team!

00:20:12.337 --> 00:20:15.298 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA]
That's why it's imaginary.

00:20:15.382 --> 00:20:17.842 position:50% align:center
I'll see you tomorrow!

00:20:22.180 --> 00:20:23.598 position:50% align:center
You ready?

00:20:27.602 --> 00:20:30.063 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA] Even if the president
became vice president,

00:20:30.146 --> 00:20:32.190 position:50% align:center
he'd still work
himself too hard.

00:20:32.273 --> 00:20:33.483 position:50% align:center
I know he would.

00:20:33.566 --> 00:20:35.694 position:50% align:center
Sure, our titles
would be different,

00:20:35.777 --> 00:20:38.196 position:50% align:center
but everything else
would stay the same.

00:20:38.279 --> 00:20:41.282 position:50% align:center
His studies are what he
should be concentrating on.

00:20:43.243 --> 00:20:45.704 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA]
Our paths may never cross again,

00:20:45.787 --> 00:20:49.207 position:50% align:center
but at least I can still dream
about the time we shared.

00:20:50.542 --> 00:20:52.002 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA grunts]

00:20:55.714 --> 00:20:59.718 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA]
I can't be selfish. Not now.

00:20:59.801 --> 00:21:01.094 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI]
Later.

00:21:03.138 --> 00:21:06.683 position:50% align:center
You did a fantastic
job, Shirogane.

00:21:06.766 --> 00:21:09.978 position:50% align:center
Thanks. You did as well.

00:21:10.061 --> 00:21:12.272 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA]
It just didn't feel right...

00:21:12.355 --> 00:21:14.983 position:50% align:center
That name coming
out of my mouth!

00:21:18.945 --> 00:21:22.449 position:50% align:center
I know that it's selfish of me.

00:21:23.491 --> 00:21:26.286 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA] But it's all
that I'll ask of you.

00:21:26.369 --> 00:21:31.666 position:50% align:center
If possible, could you
still be our president?

00:21:34.210 --> 00:21:36.129 position:50% align:center
So let me get this straight.

00:21:36.212 --> 00:21:39.341 position:50% align:center
You want me to serve as the
president for one more year?

00:21:39.424 --> 00:21:42.510 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA grunts]

00:21:42.594 --> 00:21:44.262 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA]
Mm-hm.

00:21:47.849 --> 00:21:50.143 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI] What does
this look like, Shinomiya?

00:21:53.938 --> 00:21:56.399 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA gasps]

00:21:56.483 --> 00:21:57.776 position:50% align:center
Who would have thought?

00:21:57.859 --> 00:22:00.195 position:50% align:center
You might've actually missed me!

00:22:00.278 --> 00:22:02.322 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA] You didn't keep
quiet about this the entire day

00:22:02.405 --> 00:22:05.158 position:50% align:center
in hopes that I would bring
it up, did you, President?!

00:22:05.241 --> 00:22:07.118 position:50% align:center
It's possible.

00:22:07.202 --> 00:22:10.455 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA] And I fell for it
hook, line, and sinker!

00:22:10.538 --> 00:22:14.084 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR] Results for today's
battle: Shirogane wins!

00:22:14.167 --> 00:22:15.919 position:50% align:center
Boo-yah!

00:22:17.796 --> 00:22:19.422 position:50% align:center
[TEACHER 3A] Didn't you
tell me you were withdrawing

00:22:19.506 --> 00:22:22.258 position:50% align:center
from Student Council, or am I
remembering that incorrectly?

00:22:22.342 --> 00:22:24.719 position:50% align:center
That was my original plan.

00:22:24.803 --> 00:22:28.932 position:50% align:center
I filled out the form, but I had
zero intention of turning it in.

00:22:29.015 --> 00:22:31.059 position:50% align:center
Until now.

00:22:31.142 --> 00:22:33.019 position:50% align:center
I've changed my mind!

00:22:33.103 --> 00:22:36.564 position:50% align:center
I can't pass up this chance
to show what I'm made of!

00:22:39.693 --> 00:22:42.028 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR]
To be continued!
