00:00:14.764 --> 00:00:17.017 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR] The Student
Council has disbanded,

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.103 position:50% align:center
which means the campaign
season has started anew.

00:00:20.186 --> 00:00:22.105 position:50% align:center
And since the former
council members no longer

00:00:22.188 --> 00:00:25.567 position:50% align:center
have their duties, they don't
have a reason to interact.

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.819 position:50% align:center
Three entire days have passed!

00:00:27.902 --> 00:00:29.279 position:50% align:center
And nothing's happened.

00:00:29.362 --> 00:00:30.113 position:50% align:center
Shock, shock.

00:00:30.196 --> 00:00:32.657 position:50% align:center
Surprise, surprise.

00:00:32.741 --> 00:00:34.826 position:50% align:center
[HAYASAKA] Just woman up
and make the first move.

00:00:34.909 --> 00:00:37.704 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA]
What? That's a terrible idea!

00:00:37.787 --> 00:00:40.331 position:50% align:center
Could you still
be our president?

00:00:40.415 --> 00:00:42.250 position:50% align:center
How could I have been so stupid?

00:00:42.334 --> 00:00:44.878 position:50% align:center
If I talk to him now,
you know what that'd say?

00:00:44.961 --> 00:00:46.379 position:50% align:center
I'm lonely!

00:00:46.463 --> 00:00:48.548 position:50% align:center
Then again, what if
he is equally as lonely

00:00:48.631 --> 00:00:50.550 position:50% align:center
without me as I am without him?

00:00:50.633 --> 00:00:53.011 position:50% align:center
It might even make him
confess his love, right?

00:00:53.094 --> 00:00:54.346 position:50% align:center
[HAYASAKA]
Keep dreaming.

00:00:54.429 --> 00:00:58.433 position:50% align:center
Sick visit, fireworks,
birthday, moon-viewing.

00:00:58.516 --> 00:01:00.310 position:50% align:center
You've had plenty of
chances to make progress,

00:01:00.393 --> 00:01:02.145 position:50% align:center
but nothing to show for it.

00:01:02.228 --> 00:01:03.521 position:50% align:center
Like, seriously.

00:01:03.605 --> 00:01:04.898 position:50% align:center
It's pathetic.

00:01:04.981 --> 00:01:07.067 position:50% align:center
Making a guy fall for you
should not be this hard.

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:08.193 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah?

00:01:08.276 --> 00:01:09.819 position:50% align:center
You think you would
have better luck?

00:01:09.903 --> 00:01:11.196 position:50% align:center
Is that it?

00:01:11.279 --> 00:01:12.447 position:50% align:center
Most likely.

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:15.575 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA grunts]
Then, by all means, woo away!

00:01:15.658 --> 00:01:16.910 position:50% align:center
In fact, why not see if you can

00:01:16.993 --> 00:01:18.828 position:50% align:center
sweep the president
off his feet in one day,

00:01:18.912 --> 00:01:20.080 position:50% align:center
since it's so easy for you!

00:01:20.163 --> 00:01:21.456 position:50% align:center
I never said easy.

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:22.582 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA]
Everything looks easier

00:01:22.665 --> 00:01:24.000 position:50% align:center
when you're standing
on the sidelines!

00:01:24.084 --> 00:01:25.210 position:50% align:center
[HAYASAKA]
I never said easy.

00:01:25.293 --> 00:01:26.419 position:50% align:center
If you actually tried it,

00:01:26.503 --> 00:01:28.296 position:50% align:center
then you'd know that
the struggle is real!

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.298 position:50% align:center
I never said easy.

00:01:30.382 --> 00:01:32.342 position:50% align:center
Saying that you
can is one thing.

00:01:32.425 --> 00:01:35.345 position:50% align:center
But do you actually have
the skills to back it up?!

00:01:37.806 --> 00:01:41.726 position:50% align:center
If you truly want me
to try my hand at this, I will!

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:45.397 position:50% align:center
Go right ahead then.
I dare you.

00:03:18.782 --> 00:03:20.742 position:50% align:center
[CLERK 4A]
Have a nice day.

00:03:23.036 --> 00:03:24.412 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI]
Hm?

00:03:26.414 --> 00:03:29.167 position:50% align:center
Hi! Fancy meeting you here!

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:32.796 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI] Um. Wait, I know you.
You're Shinomiya's maid.

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:34.422 position:50% align:center
Hayasaka A. Smithee, right?

00:03:34.506 --> 00:03:37.592 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Bingo! You remembered!

00:03:37.676 --> 00:03:39.803 position:50% align:center
That's so sweet!

00:03:41.096 --> 00:03:44.641 position:50% align:center
Well, truth be told, I actually
didn't recognize you at first.

00:03:44.724 --> 00:03:46.434 position:50% align:center
You look a little different.

00:03:46.518 --> 00:03:47.852 position:50% align:center
I'm off the clock!

00:03:47.936 --> 00:03:51.231 position:50% align:center
It's tough acting
formal 24/7, y'know?

00:03:51.314 --> 00:03:53.400 position:50% align:center
Yeah. I bet.

00:03:53.483 --> 00:03:54.984 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA]
She's good.

00:03:55.068 --> 00:03:56.820 position:50% align:center
She waited till he was
in the checkout line,

00:03:56.903 --> 00:03:58.863 position:50% align:center
so he couldn't get away.

00:03:58.947 --> 00:04:00.365 position:50% align:center
Although Hayasaka may, indeed,

00:04:00.448 --> 00:04:02.075 position:50% align:center
have some skill
in this department,

00:04:02.158 --> 00:04:03.410 position:50% align:center
there's absolutely no way

00:04:03.493 --> 00:04:04.953 position:50% align:center
she'll be able to
seduce the president!

00:04:05.036 --> 00:04:06.663 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI]
Your accent has changed, too.

00:04:06.746 --> 00:04:07.789 position:50% align:center
It's less noticeable.

00:04:07.872 --> 00:04:09.624 position:50% align:center
Studying helped with that!

00:04:09.708 --> 00:04:13.086 position:50% align:center
But I know you study your butt
off, too, don't you, Shirogane?

00:04:13.169 --> 00:04:15.213 position:50% align:center
I mean, I try.

00:04:15.296 --> 00:04:16.798 position:50% align:center
[HAYASAKA]
It's embarrassing.

00:04:16.881 --> 00:04:20.093 position:50% align:center
I'm buying a magazine for the
masses right in front of you.

00:04:20.176 --> 00:04:22.262 position:50% align:center
Oh, are you into tech stuff?

00:04:22.345 --> 00:04:25.140 position:50% align:center
Well, I was thinking
about buying a laptop,

00:04:25.223 --> 00:04:26.641 position:50% align:center
but I don't know
which one to get.

00:04:26.725 --> 00:04:28.393 position:50% align:center
Luckily, I ran into you,

00:04:28.476 --> 00:04:30.687 position:50% align:center
and boys know more
about this kind of stuff!

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:32.564 position:50% align:center
So I'll let you decide!

00:04:32.647 --> 00:04:34.357 position:50% align:center
Computers aren't
really my forte.

00:04:34.441 --> 00:04:35.567 position:50% align:center
[HAYASAKA]
Something tells me your eye

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:37.110 position:50% align:center
is still better than mine.

00:04:37.193 --> 00:04:40.405 position:50% align:center
Let's stop by the cafeteria
so I can pick your noggin. Cool?

00:04:40.488 --> 00:04:42.115 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA]
She is really good.

00:04:42.198 --> 00:04:43.867 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR]
The "teach me" strategy.

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:46.286 position:50% align:center
Instead of demanding
that a child clean his room,

00:04:46.369 --> 00:04:47.912 position:50% align:center
the parent will ask
a question like,

00:04:47.996 --> 00:04:49.247 position:50% align:center
"Where do your toys go?"

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:51.875 position:50% align:center
and the child will put
them away while explaining.

00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:53.918 position:50% align:center
Humans have an
innate drive to teach,

00:04:54.002 --> 00:04:56.921 position:50% align:center
and Hayasaka has cleverly
used that to her advantage.

00:04:57.005 --> 00:04:58.840 position:50% align:center
Sure. I've got
some time to kill.

00:04:58.923 --> 00:05:00.091 position:50% align:center
Awesome!

00:05:00.175 --> 00:05:04.095 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA]
President!

00:05:06.097 --> 00:05:08.141 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI] Which school
is that uniform from?

00:05:08.224 --> 00:05:10.935 position:50% align:center
[HAYASAKA]
Oh! Firis Girls' Academy.

00:05:11.019 --> 00:05:12.771 position:50% align:center
I'm a second year.

00:05:12.854 --> 00:05:15.732 position:50% align:center
I met the Shinomiyas thanks
to a friend from school.

00:05:15.815 --> 00:05:17.442 position:50% align:center
Now I fill in as
a part-time maid

00:05:17.525 --> 00:05:19.277 position:50% align:center
whenever they're shorthanded.

00:05:19.361 --> 00:05:21.071 position:50% align:center
It's a part-time job?

00:05:21.154 --> 00:05:22.030 position:50% align:center
[HAYASAKA]
Mm-hm.

00:05:22.113 --> 00:05:23.490 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA]
The nerve of this girl,

00:05:23.573 --> 00:05:25.909 position:50% align:center
lying through her teeth with
a straight face like that.

00:05:25.992 --> 00:05:28.036 position:50% align:center
She's a normal student
at Shuchiin Academy,

00:05:28.119 --> 00:05:29.412 position:50% align:center
is perfectly articulate,

00:05:29.496 --> 00:05:31.498 position:50% align:center
and the only thing part-time
about her job as my maid

00:05:31.581 --> 00:05:33.958 position:50% align:center
was the small part of her
childhood when she wasn't!

00:05:34.042 --> 00:05:35.251 position:50% align:center
Stop eating her lies up

00:05:35.335 --> 00:05:37.462 position:50% align:center
like they're
your favorite flavor!

00:05:37.545 --> 00:05:39.589 position:50% align:center
[HAYASAKA]
So basically,

00:05:39.673 --> 00:05:42.425 position:50% align:center
I've used my parents' computer
for as long as I can remember.

00:05:42.509 --> 00:05:45.136 position:50% align:center
But I saved up my money
and now I want my own!

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:46.304 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI]
Ah.

00:05:46.388 --> 00:05:47.639 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA] It's only
a matter of time before

00:05:47.722 --> 00:05:49.766 position:50% align:center
the president catches
her in one of these lies.

00:05:49.849 --> 00:05:51.726 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA] He's sharp
about things like that.

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:53.061 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI] Working to
pay for what she wants

00:05:53.144 --> 00:05:55.313 position:50% align:center
instead of relying on
her parents. That's great!

00:05:55.397 --> 00:05:57.357 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA]
He's been duped!

00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:59.484 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI] What do you plan
on using the computer for?

00:05:59.567 --> 00:06:00.902 position:50% align:center
[HAYASAKA]
Hmm.

00:06:00.985 --> 00:06:03.196 position:50% align:center
Mostly research and putting
school reports together.

00:06:03.279 --> 00:06:05.073 position:50% align:center
Oh! And videos!

00:06:05.156 --> 00:06:07.075 position:50% align:center
Especially if
they're of cute cats!

00:06:07.158 --> 00:06:09.119 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA]
It's all lies! C'mon, President.

00:06:09.202 --> 00:06:11.496 position:50% align:center
Surely you won't fall
for such an obvious trap.

00:06:11.579 --> 00:06:13.039 position:50% align:center
She would rather watch
things get crushed

00:06:13.123 --> 00:06:15.959 position:50% align:center
in a machine press than
a cute cat curled up on a rug!

00:06:16.042 --> 00:06:17.168 position:50% align:center
[CAT meows]

00:06:17.252 --> 00:06:20.005 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI]
Cats! Yeah! I get it.

00:06:20.088 --> 00:06:23.842 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA]
You're killing me here!

00:06:23.925 --> 00:06:27.512 position:50% align:center
You can watch videos on anything
so you should be covered.

00:06:27.595 --> 00:06:30.432 position:50% align:center
Good to know!
I'll choose by design, then!

00:06:30.515 --> 00:06:31.975 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA] This is coming
from the girl who installs

00:06:32.058 --> 00:06:34.477 position:50% align:center
every microchip in
her computer herself!

00:06:34.561 --> 00:06:36.896 position:50% align:center
It'll be over once she
makes her "final selection,"

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:38.732 position:50% align:center
then we can finally
close the chapter

00:06:38.815 --> 00:06:40.692 position:50% align:center
on this little
misadventure. [giggles]

00:06:40.775 --> 00:06:42.068 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI]
So in other words,

00:06:42.152 --> 00:06:44.362 position:50% align:center
solving it with the
probability recurrence formula,

00:06:44.446 --> 00:06:47.073 position:50% align:center
which derives case analyses, is
more efficient in the long run.

00:06:47.157 --> 00:06:48.700 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA]
When did he start tutoring her?

00:06:48.783 --> 00:06:51.786 position:50% align:center
He's never offered
to help me study before!

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:54.372 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI] There's really not all
that much I can teach you.

00:06:54.456 --> 00:06:56.624 position:50% align:center
Isn't Firis Academy a top
school, too?

00:06:56.708 --> 00:06:59.878 position:50% align:center
[HAYASAKA] It is, but I'm not
the best at taking tests.

00:06:59.961 --> 00:07:05.008 position:50% align:center
[sighs] Stinks. Even though
I study ten hours a day.

00:07:05.091 --> 00:07:05.884 position:50% align:center
[yawns]

00:07:05.967 --> 00:07:07.177 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI]
Ten hours?

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:09.387 position:50% align:center
So we're walking down
the same thorny path!

00:07:09.471 --> 00:07:11.681 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA] Stop believing
everything she says!

00:07:11.765 --> 00:07:15.352 position:50% align:center
You know not making time
for sleep is unhealthy.

00:07:21.733 --> 00:07:22.942 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI]
Hey.

00:07:23.026 --> 00:07:24.778 position:50% align:center
[HAYASAKA grunts]

00:07:24.861 --> 00:07:26.988 position:50% align:center
Seriously?

00:07:32.827 --> 00:07:34.788 position:50% align:center
Huh? Did I fall asleep?!

00:07:34.871 --> 00:07:37.207 position:50% align:center
No way! I was out
for three hours?

00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:39.084 position:50% align:center
I tried to wake
you up a few times.

00:07:39.167 --> 00:07:42.045 position:50% align:center
[HAYASAKA]
Oh, my gosh. How embarrassing!

00:07:42.128 --> 00:07:43.838 position:50% align:center
[HAYASAKA whines]

00:07:43.922 --> 00:07:45.507 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA]
You think you're so sly,

00:07:45.590 --> 00:07:47.425 position:50% align:center
but I caught you stealing
glances at the president

00:07:47.509 --> 00:07:50.470 position:50% align:center
through squinted eyes several
times these past three hours!

00:07:50.553 --> 00:07:51.971 position:50% align:center
[HAYASAKA]
You should've gone home.

00:07:52.055 --> 00:07:53.598 position:50% align:center
I never meant to
keep you this long.

00:07:53.682 --> 00:07:56.309 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI] And leave a defenseless
girl all by herself?

00:07:56.393 --> 00:07:57.435 position:50% align:center
Not happening.

00:07:57.519 --> 00:07:58.645 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:07:58.728 --> 00:08:01.564 position:50% align:center
Fatigue from studying
is a sign of effort.

00:08:01.648 --> 00:08:03.024 position:50% align:center
[HAYASAKA]
Shirogane.

00:08:03.108 --> 00:08:05.193 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR] She's giving
Shirogane the look.

00:08:05.276 --> 00:08:06.361 position:50% align:center
You know, the one that says,

00:08:06.444 --> 00:08:07.946 position:50% align:center
"I've never met a man
like this before!

00:08:08.029 --> 00:08:09.948 position:50% align:center
Could he be my soul mate?"

00:08:10.031 --> 00:08:11.658 position:50% align:center
Words aren't the only
way to tell someone

00:08:11.741 --> 00:08:14.411 position:50% align:center
what you're thinking, and
Hayaska has mastered the art.

00:08:14.494 --> 00:08:16.454 position:50% align:center
She's a pro!

00:08:16.538 --> 00:08:18.873 position:50% align:center
[HAYASAKA]
Say, Shirogane.

00:08:18.957 --> 00:08:21.334 position:50% align:center
Would you wanna go
out with me sometime?

00:08:21.418 --> 00:08:22.627 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR]
Damn.

00:08:22.711 --> 00:08:25.588 position:50% align:center
What man could turn
down an invite like that?

00:08:25.672 --> 00:08:27.007 position:50% align:center
We could take a modern approach

00:08:27.090 --> 00:08:29.342 position:50% align:center
and I'll be 90 percent friend,
ten percent girlfriend,

00:08:29.426 --> 00:08:32.137 position:50% align:center
at least until we get
better acquainted.

00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:33.680 position:50% align:center
Even if there's
another girl you like,

00:08:33.763 --> 00:08:35.432 position:50% align:center
that doesn't bother me at all!

00:08:35.515 --> 00:08:37.559 position:50% align:center
You can still be with her and
I'll just be your side piece!

00:08:37.642 --> 00:08:39.602 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR] Conceptual ambiguity!

00:08:39.686 --> 00:08:41.146 position:50% align:center
Not only is this girl cute,

00:08:41.229 --> 00:08:43.356 position:50% align:center
but she's willing to be a lil'
somethin' somethin' on the side

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:47.027 position:50% align:center
while he figures out what he
really wants in a girlfriend.

00:08:47.110 --> 00:08:48.778 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA]
I was wrong.

00:08:48.862 --> 00:08:50.655 position:50% align:center
I should've never
made you do this!

00:08:50.739 --> 00:08:51.990 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI]
I'm sorry.

00:08:52.073 --> 00:08:54.075 position:50% align:center
But... there's
another girl I like.

00:08:54.159 --> 00:08:55.577 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA gasps]

00:08:58.747 --> 00:09:01.791 position:50% align:center
Ah... I see.

00:09:01.875 --> 00:09:04.878 position:50% align:center
She's one lucky girl.

00:09:04.961 --> 00:09:08.548 position:50% align:center
Hope everything works out
for the both of you, truly.

00:09:12.635 --> 00:09:16.681 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA] He said,
"No thank you!" Told ya so!

00:09:16.765 --> 00:09:18.683 position:50% align:center
He's definitely
a tough nut to crack.

00:09:18.767 --> 00:09:20.018 position:50% align:center
--And you thought it'd be easy.

00:09:20.101 --> 00:09:20.977 position:50% align:center
--Don't say easy!
--And you thought it'd be easy.

[KAGUYA gasps]

00:09:22.187 --> 00:09:23.355 position:50% align:center
And besides,

00:09:23.438 --> 00:09:26.191 position:50% align:center
I never said that it
would only take one day!

00:09:26.274 --> 00:09:27.025 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA]
Uh...

00:09:27.108 --> 00:09:28.693 position:50% align:center
[HAYASAKA growls]

00:09:28.777 --> 00:09:30.945 position:50% align:center
Give me a month and
he'll be head over heels!

00:09:31.029 --> 00:09:32.989 position:50% align:center
A day just made
me look desperate!

00:09:33.073 --> 00:09:34.824 position:50% align:center
I didn't wanna do it to begin
with!

00:09:34.908 --> 00:09:36.117 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA]
Uh...

00:09:36.201 --> 00:09:37.285 position:50% align:center
[HAYASAKA] The only
reason I went through this

00:09:37.369 --> 00:09:38.870 position:50% align:center
is because you told me to!

00:09:38.953 --> 00:09:41.664 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA grunts]
I'm sorry.

00:09:41.748 --> 00:09:43.875 position:50% align:center

00:09:46.670 --> 00:09:48.672 position:50% align:center
Hayasaka loses.

00:09:55.470 --> 00:09:58.181 position:50% align:center
[CHIKA]
The Student Council election.

00:09:58.264 --> 00:10:01.476 position:50% align:center
You're an outsider
among our peers, Miyuki.

00:10:01.559 --> 00:10:02.977 position:50% align:center
Most students are purebloods

00:10:03.061 --> 00:10:05.647 position:50% align:center
who started Shuchiin
in elementary school.

00:10:05.730 --> 00:10:08.108 position:50% align:center
Right.

00:10:08.191 --> 00:10:10.318 position:50% align:center
Some probably
weren't very thrilled

00:10:10.402 --> 00:10:12.070 position:50% align:center
when they caught wind
of your re-election.

00:10:12.153 --> 00:10:13.488 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:10:13.571 --> 00:10:15.365 position:50% align:center
That specific group proved
to be quite the challenge

00:10:15.448 --> 00:10:17.784 position:50% align:center
in my previous
campaign as well.

00:10:17.867 --> 00:10:19.536 position:50% align:center
[CHIKA]
About your speeches.

00:10:19.619 --> 00:10:21.496 position:50% align:center
I think you should
forgo writing them yourself

00:10:21.579 --> 00:10:23.957 position:50% align:center
and put somebody else in charge!

00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:25.500 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI grunts]

00:10:25.583 --> 00:10:27.460 position:50% align:center
[CHIKA] Fortunately, there's
a girl with enough popularity

00:10:27.544 --> 00:10:29.462 position:50% align:center
and charisma to sway the
pureblood's.

00:10:29.546 --> 00:10:32.590 position:50% align:center
And she just happens to
already be in your corner!

00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:35.135 position:50% align:center

Of course...

00:10:35.218 --> 00:10:36.720 position:50% align:center
...I'm talking about--

00:10:36.803 --> 00:10:38.972 position:50% align:center
None other than Shinomiya.

00:10:40.181 --> 00:10:42.726 position:50% align:center
You just officially
lost my vote, Miyuki!

00:10:42.809 --> 00:10:46.396 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI] Wait... Were you
referring to yourself?

00:10:46.479 --> 00:10:48.314 position:50% align:center
If so, my bad.

00:10:49.607 --> 00:10:50.650 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT A]
Have you decided who

00:10:50.734 --> 00:10:51.568 position:50% align:center
you're gonna vote
for in the election?

00:10:51.651 --> 00:10:53.403 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI]
Awkward!

00:10:53.486 --> 00:10:55.780 position:50% align:center
Get your life together and
just walk through the door!

Oh, wow!

You're here to visit
my class, how lucky!

Have we met somewhere before?

Why, sure we have, silly!

00:11:09.252 --> 00:11:11.129 position:50% align:center
We go to the same
school after all!

00:11:11.212 --> 00:11:14.090 position:50% align:center
[HAYASAKA] So are you here
for someone in particular?

00:11:14.174 --> 00:11:15.759 position:50% align:center
Yes. Shinomiya.

00:11:15.842 --> 00:11:18.553 position:50% align:center
Okay!

[KAGUYA squeals]

00:11:32.609 --> 00:11:35.362 position:50% align:center
So, uh, what did
you wanna talk about?

00:11:35.445 --> 00:11:38.865 position:50% align:center
It's kinda private,
but also important.

00:11:38.948 --> 00:11:40.158 position:50% align:center
I've decided I need you...

[KAGUYA, STUDENTS gasping]

00:11:41.868 --> 00:11:43.953 position:50% align:center

...to help plan a strategy.

00:11:44.037 --> 00:11:45.580 position:50% align:center
You know, for the election.

00:11:45.663 --> 00:11:47.457 position:50% align:center
Meet me behind the
building after school

00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:50.460 position:50% align:center

[MAKI]
This is old news.

00:11:55.256 --> 00:11:56.633 position:50% align:center
They're always
together after school,

00:11:56.716 --> 00:11:58.468 position:50% align:center
so why wouldn't they be dating?

every once in while!

00:12:04.307 --> 00:12:05.308 position:50% align:center
So what's the scoop?

Spill it!

I don't think they're
together, but...

00:12:09.437 --> 00:12:10.689 position:50% align:center

A topic as hot as wildfire

is naturally going
to spread like it,

Well, so far, nothing
to make note of.

Yeah... so about that...

[NARRATOR] Countless eyes
were locked on to them.

00:13:24.137 --> 00:13:27.015 position:50% align:center

was permeated with expectation

00:13:27.098 --> 00:13:30.185 position:50% align:center
of a manly confession
of love from Shirogane!

they're expecting me to!

a matter of pride.

We come from
different backgrounds,

would be necessary

She's a talented youth

00:18:05.585 --> 00:18:07.671 position:50% align:center
is at the top of her class.

00:18:07.754 --> 00:18:09.506 position:50% align:center
Her father is
a High Court Judge,

00:18:09.589 --> 00:18:11.758 position:50% align:center
which makes her Public
Morals Committee membership

00:18:11.841 --> 00:18:13.176 position:50% align:center
all the more fitting.

00:18:13.259 --> 00:18:16.096 position:50% align:center
She's a diligent honors student
with exemplary conduct.

00:18:16.179 --> 00:18:18.056 position:50% align:center
She's also only four foot eight!

Oh, cool.

00:18:34.447 --> 00:18:36.783 position:50% align:center

but they're not everything.

00:18:36.866 --> 00:18:39.828 position:50% align:center

experience is equally essential!

00:18:39.911 --> 00:18:42.997 position:50% align:center
[CHIKA] Wait. Does he really see
himself as this girl's rival,

00:18:43.081 --> 00:18:45.000 position:50% align:center
or is he just being petty?

but it builds character.

00:18:48.545 --> 00:18:51.172 position:50% align:center
[MIKO] It's more than you've
been doing, which is nothing.

00:18:51.256 --> 00:18:53.925 position:50% align:center
Has the king become
complacent in his castle?

00:18:54.009 --> 00:18:57.470 position:50% align:center
Or is he every bit as
careless as he appears to be?

00:18:57.554 --> 00:18:59.681 position:50% align:center
Exposure is the
essence of campaigning,

00:18:59.764 --> 00:19:01.433 position:50% align:center
so, yeah, fliers are good.

00:19:01.516 --> 00:19:04.352 position:50% align:center
But... that kind of
grunt work isn't necessary

00:19:04.436 --> 00:19:06.479 position:50% align:center
when you've got an
actual track record.

that kind of carelessness.

but we're inviting students

alternative political platforms,

Sorry. Miyuki is
saying that stuff

00:20:00.158 --> 00:20:02.077 position:50% align:center

him self-conscious.

once I'm elected as

If you actually knew her,

00:20:26.518 --> 00:20:28.061 position:50% align:center
you'd never make
such a stupid request!

being straight up rude!

You seem like a sensible girl!

00:20:32.691 --> 00:20:34.275 position:50% align:center
Can you convince your
friend to change her mind

00:20:34.359 --> 00:20:35.568 position:50% align:center
before mistakes are made?

00:20:35.652 --> 00:20:36.861 position:50% align:center
[OSARAGI]
No.

00:20:36.945 --> 00:20:39.030 position:50% align:center
Fujiwara would make
a suitable vice president

00:20:39.114 --> 00:20:40.657 position:50% align:center
from a logical standpoint.

ever cross your mind!

00:20:45.995 --> 00:20:48.456 position:50% align:center
I can't think of a
single person who compares!

00:20:48.540 --> 00:20:51.209 position:50% align:center
[CHIKA giggles]

00:20:51.292 --> 00:20:52.919 position:50% align:center
She took home the
grand prize at the

00:20:53.003 --> 00:20:56.506 position:50% align:center
national PTA piano competition!
How amazing is that?

00:20:56.589 --> 00:20:58.341 position:50% align:center
Way back in fourth grade.

00:20:58.425 --> 00:21:00.844 position:50% align:center
She also speaks five
different languages!

00:21:00.927 --> 00:21:02.721 position:50% align:center
Well, my folks are diplomats.

00:21:02.804 --> 00:21:04.264 position:50% align:center
[MIKO] And even though
she's positively brilliant,

00:21:04.347 --> 00:21:05.890 position:50% align:center
she only boasts average grades!

00:21:05.974 --> 00:21:09.144 position:50% align:center
Yes. Average. Yay...

00:21:09.227 --> 00:21:11.479 position:50% align:center
[MIKO]
Ever since I was a little kid,

00:21:11.563 --> 00:21:14.816 position:50% align:center
I've played the piano
and idolized Fujiwara!

00:21:14.899 --> 00:21:16.943 position:50% align:center
She's a prodigy who's
light years ahead of me

00:21:17.027 --> 00:21:18.278 position:50% align:center
and every last one of us

00:21:18.361 --> 00:21:21.656 position:50% align:center
is lucky to even be in
her presence! You hear me?!

00:21:22.824 --> 00:21:24.617 position:50% align:center
Go on... Praise me more.

00:21:24.701 --> 00:21:25.994 position:50% align:center
[MIKO] If there's one
thing I know for sure,

00:21:26.077 --> 00:21:27.912 position:50% align:center
it's that Fujiwara
is incredible!

00:21:27.996 --> 00:21:29.664 position:50% align:center
People have been treating
me like a has-been

00:21:29.748 --> 00:21:31.791 position:50% align:center
ever since I stopped
playing, so I'm flattered!

00:21:31.875 --> 00:21:34.502 position:50% align:center
You may be the favorite
as of this moment.

00:21:34.586 --> 00:21:35.754 position:50% align:center
However...

00:21:35.837 --> 00:21:38.423 position:50% align:center
...I refuse to back
down on my ideals!

00:21:38.506 --> 00:21:39.841 position:50% align:center
With time,

00:21:39.924 --> 00:21:43.261 position:50% align:center
people will come to understand
them the same way I do.

00:21:43.345 --> 00:21:45.555 position:50% align:center
If I wasn't sure
before, I am now.

00:21:45.638 --> 00:21:47.474 position:50% align:center
Fujiwara and I are going to win!

00:21:47.557 --> 00:21:50.185 position:50% align:center
Don't take us lightly!

00:21:50.268 --> 00:21:53.396 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI] A few compliments,
and suddenly you're on her side?

00:21:55.273 --> 00:21:57.400 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI]
So that's Miko Iino.

00:21:57.484 --> 00:22:00.695 position:50% align:center
It looks like we'll
have to step up our game.

00:22:00.779 --> 00:22:03.073 position:50% align:center
Personally, I wouldn't
worry too much, Prez.

00:22:03.156 --> 00:22:04.115 position:50% align:center
How come?

00:22:04.199 --> 00:22:06.993 position:50% align:center
Easy. Just read the flier.

00:22:07.077 --> 00:22:09.621 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI]
Hm?

00:22:09.704 --> 00:22:12.207 position:50% align:center
[YU] Shaved heads, no cell
phones, and weekly bag checks?

00:22:12.290 --> 00:22:15.377 position:50% align:center
Her strict policy is
more a flaw than an asset.

00:22:15.460 --> 00:22:18.421 position:50% align:center
Those fliers aren't doing
her any favors, that's for sure.

00:22:18.505 --> 00:22:19.756 position:50% align:center
But she doesn't see it.

00:22:19.839 --> 00:22:22.467 position:50% align:center
Yeah... right.

00:22:22.550 --> 00:22:26.054 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR] Shirogane dominates
the election even more.

00:22:26.137 --> 00:22:27.263 position:50% align:center
[YU]
I wish it would sit her down

00:22:27.347 --> 00:22:28.765 position:50% align:center
and tell her how crazy she acts.

00:22:28.848 --> 00:22:32.310 position:50% align:center
Maybe then she'd realize
what kind of person she is.

00:22:32.394 --> 00:22:35.522 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR]
As for Kaguya...

00:22:35.605 --> 00:22:38.191 position:50% align:center
Where did everybody go?

00:22:38.274 --> 00:22:41.820 position:50% align:center
[CHIKA chuckles, grunts]
