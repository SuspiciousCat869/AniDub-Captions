[microphone hums]

00:01:45.563 --> 00:01:48.441 position:50% align:center
[YU] I have a little favor to
ask of you, if that's all right.

00:01:48.525 --> 00:01:51.444 position:50% align:center
Please beat this girl
in a landslide victory.

00:01:51.528 --> 00:01:53.530 position:50% align:center
Why are you acting so seriously?

00:01:53.613 --> 00:01:56.324 position:50% align:center
Polling shows we've got
almost 90% of the vote.

00:01:56.408 --> 00:01:58.368 position:50% align:center
You're worrying over nothing.

00:01:58.451 --> 00:02:00.036 position:50% align:center
I think we've got
this election on lock.

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:01.788 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA] Unless they have
something up their sleeve

00:02:01.871 --> 00:02:02.914 position:50% align:center
we're unaware of.

00:02:02.997 --> 00:02:05.083 position:50% align:center
Nope. Nada.

00:02:05.166 --> 00:02:08.503 position:50% align:center
We're definitely gonna win
today's election, no doubt.

00:02:08.586 --> 00:02:09.963 position:50% align:center
Why just win, though?

00:02:10.046 --> 00:02:12.924 position:50% align:center
We should make it an
indisputable shutout.

00:02:13.008 --> 00:02:16.428 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI] Is there something
between you and Miko Iino?

00:02:22.142 --> 00:02:24.144 position:50% align:center
[OSARAGI]
What are you doing, Miko?

00:02:24.227 --> 00:02:25.979 position:50% align:center
Making the sign for
a person on your palm

00:02:26.062 --> 00:02:28.690 position:50% align:center
and swallowing it
calms the nerves.

00:02:28.773 --> 00:02:30.400 position:50% align:center
Would you care to try?

00:02:30.483 --> 00:02:32.444 position:50% align:center
Interesting.

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:36.573 position:50% align:center
Can't do it.

00:02:36.656 --> 00:02:38.033 position:50% align:center
What? Why?

00:02:38.116 --> 00:02:41.202 position:50% align:center
I'm entirely too empathetic
to swallow another person.

00:02:41.286 --> 00:02:42.996 position:50% align:center
It makes me feel guilty.

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:44.581 position:50% align:center
[MIKO]
What're you talking about?

00:02:44.664 --> 00:02:46.666 position:50% align:center
[OSARAGI] What if he has a
loving family waiting for him

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:47.667 position:50% align:center
to come home?

00:02:47.751 --> 00:02:48.668 position:50% align:center
He doesn't.

00:02:48.752 --> 00:02:49.961 position:50% align:center
[OSARAGI]
Then he's all alone.

00:02:50.045 --> 00:02:51.254 position:50% align:center
[MIKO]
You're missing the point.

00:02:51.338 --> 00:02:54.049 position:50% align:center
He needs a name,
and that name is Yusaku.

00:02:54.132 --> 00:02:56.801 position:50% align:center
Naming him makes it even
tougher to swallow him.

00:02:56.885 --> 00:02:58.345 position:50% align:center
Hey, we're about
to start, you two.

00:02:58.428 --> 00:03:00.722 position:50% align:center
Oh, thanks!

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:03.266 position:50% align:center
[MIKO gasps]

00:03:08.438 --> 00:03:10.732 position:50% align:center
Go. You've got this.

00:03:12.233 --> 00:03:14.069 position:50% align:center
Uh! You ate Yusaku!

00:03:14.986 --> 00:03:18.656 position:50% align:center
[STUDENTS murmuring]

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:22.660 position:50% align:center
Miko Iino is an incredibly
honest individual!

00:03:22.744 --> 00:03:25.246 position:50% align:center
She's one of the
purest girls I know.

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:29.000 position:50% align:center
Someone who lives her life
with purpose and great intent.

00:03:29.084 --> 00:03:30.627 position:50% align:center
Most of you are well aware.

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:32.712 position:50% align:center
You've seen her work through
the Public Morals Committee

00:03:32.796 --> 00:03:34.714 position:50% align:center
and you know how earnest she is.

00:03:34.798 --> 00:03:36.841 position:50% align:center
She's been part of that
committee since middle school,

00:03:36.925 --> 00:03:39.803 position:50% align:center
demonstrating her loyalty to
the academy for several years.

00:03:39.886 --> 00:03:41.054 position:50% align:center
And she's as devoted
to her studies...

00:03:41.137 --> 00:03:42.889 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI]
No hesitation.

00:03:42.972 --> 00:03:45.141 position:50% align:center
She must've practiced a lot.

00:03:45.225 --> 00:03:49.062 position:50% align:center
Perhaps, but nobody's
really paying attention.

00:03:49.145 --> 00:03:52.065 position:50% align:center
Half of the students are
in their own little worlds.

00:03:52.148 --> 00:03:53.566 position:50% align:center
[OSARAGI] So when it
comes time to vote,

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:57.153 position:50% align:center
please vote for Miko Iino!

00:03:57.237 --> 00:04:00.699 position:50% align:center
Thank you. This
concludes my speech.

00:04:00.782 --> 00:04:01.574 position:50% align:center
[STAFF 6A]
Well done.

00:04:01.658 --> 00:04:03.535 position:50% align:center
Now, on behalf of Mr. Shirogane,

00:04:03.618 --> 00:04:05.328 position:50% align:center
Miss Shinomiya will
give a few words.

00:04:05.412 --> 00:04:06.871 position:50% align:center
[STUDENTS murmuring]

00:04:06.955 --> 00:04:07.914 position:50% align:center
Yay, Kaguya.

00:04:07.997 --> 00:04:09.249 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT 6C]
She's honor incarnate!

[STUDENTS gasping, chattering]

00:04:25.974 --> 00:04:28.643 position:50% align:center
My name is Kaguya Shinomiya,
and I'm here in support

00:04:28.727 --> 00:04:31.396 position:50% align:center
of presidential candidate
Miyuki Shirogane.

00:04:31.479 --> 00:04:33.523 position:50% align:center
Let us begin. As you all know...

00:04:33.606 --> 00:04:35.692 position:50% align:center
[OSARAGI] That mic
feedback was deliberate.

00:04:35.775 --> 00:04:38.653 position:50% align:center
She wanted to make sure she had
everyone's undivided attention,

00:04:38.737 --> 00:04:40.530 position:50% align:center
teachers included.

00:04:40.613 --> 00:04:41.823 position:50% align:center
[TEACHER 6A grunts]

00:04:41.906 --> 00:04:43.241 position:50% align:center
[CHIKA]
Hm?

00:04:44.242 --> 00:04:46.036 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA] For starters,
the council can't do anything

00:04:46.119 --> 00:04:47.954 position:50% align:center
without monetary contributions.

00:04:48.038 --> 00:04:49.414 position:50% align:center
Needless to say,

00:04:49.497 --> 00:04:52.917 position:50% align:center
we have to be smart and ensure
that money isn't wasted.

00:04:53.001 --> 00:04:56.212 position:50% align:center
And we do that by having an
effective management of assets.

00:04:56.296 --> 00:04:58.006 position:50% align:center
As the graph you see
here indicates,

00:04:58.089 --> 00:05:00.050 position:50% align:center
the year we were most successful
in how we made use

00:05:00.133 --> 00:05:02.260 position:50% align:center
of our finances and resources
was the year we had

00:05:02.344 --> 00:05:04.304 position:50% align:center
former President
Shirogane's leadership...

00:05:04.387 --> 00:05:05.597 position:50% align:center
[HAYASAKA]
Yeah, come to think of it,

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:07.057 position:50% align:center
they do get the job done.

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:09.059 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT 6R]
So what?

00:05:09.142 --> 00:05:10.810 position:50% align:center
That still doesn't
make him a pureblood.

00:05:10.894 --> 00:05:13.188 position:50% align:center
Stop. You should be
paying attention.

00:05:13.271 --> 00:05:14.773 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA] President Shirogane
always considered...

00:05:14.856 --> 00:05:17.692 position:50% align:center
[OSARAGI] Fujiwara knew that
was an anti-Shirogane section

00:05:17.776 --> 00:05:20.153 position:50% align:center
and escorted a teacher
to stand by them.

00:05:20.236 --> 00:05:22.655 position:50% align:center
They know exactly
what they're doing.

00:05:22.739 --> 00:05:24.240 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA]
Finally, to help explain

00:05:24.324 --> 00:05:28.411 position:50% align:center
our forthcoming club policies,
I've prepared a video.

00:05:28.495 --> 00:05:31.289 position:50% align:center
We're going to let a student
survey decide the destination

00:05:31.373 --> 00:05:32.707 position:50% align:center
of the class trip this year.

00:05:32.791 --> 00:05:36.878 position:50% align:center
[STUDENTS gasping, chattering]

00:05:36.961 --> 00:05:40.840 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA] This way, everybody
can have a say in the matter.

00:05:40.924 --> 00:05:44.511 position:50% align:center
[STUDENTS chattering]

00:05:44.594 --> 00:05:46.846 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA] Shirogane cares,
and to demonstrate that,

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:49.182 position:50% align:center
he brought back one our
favorite teachers of all time

00:05:49.265 --> 00:05:51.434 position:50% align:center
to lead a special class.

00:05:51.518 --> 00:05:55.480 position:50% align:center
[OSARAGI] The only thing this
video promotes is propaganda.

00:05:55.563 --> 00:05:57.357 position:50% align:center
Ishigami.

00:05:58.358 --> 00:05:59.984 position:50% align:center
They're really eating it up.

00:06:00.068 --> 00:06:02.278 position:50% align:center
It's an approximation of
the things you've accomplished

00:06:02.362 --> 00:06:04.739 position:50% align:center
and what people can expect.

00:06:04.823 --> 00:06:07.784 position:50% align:center
What matters is how those
things are presented.

00:06:07.867 --> 00:06:10.745 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI] Still, I think you put
a little more effort into it

00:06:10.829 --> 00:06:12.247 position:50% align:center
than you needed to.

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:14.290 position:50% align:center
[YU]
Remember what I told you?

00:06:14.374 --> 00:06:17.293 position:50% align:center
I wanna beat Miko Iino
in a landslide.

00:06:17.377 --> 00:06:18.461 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA]
Thank you.

00:06:18.545 --> 00:06:21.006 position:50% align:center
I appreciate your time
and consideration.

00:06:22.173 --> 00:06:24.467 position:50% align:center

accomplishments. But...

Next, we'll hear from

00:06:37.355 --> 00:06:40.108 position:50% align:center
presidential candidate
Miko Iino.

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:43.695 position:50% align:center

Hmph.

00:06:59.753 --> 00:07:03.423 position:50% align:center

00:07:05.008 --> 00:07:06.801 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT 6I]
Don't tell me she's nervous.

00:07:06.885 --> 00:07:12.891 position:50% align:center
[STUDENTS chattering, laughing]

00:07:16.227 --> 00:07:18.188 position:50% align:center
[YU]
Yep. Same pattern.

00:07:18.271 --> 00:07:21.066 position:50% align:center
This is why she's
never won an election.

00:07:21.149 --> 00:07:23.777 position:50% align:center
She's always been garbage
in front of a crowd,

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:26.654 position:50% align:center
and every time she
loses, it gets worse.

00:07:28.448 --> 00:07:31.242 position:50% align:center
It's laughable.

00:07:31.326 --> 00:07:36.081 position:50% align:center
She's a model student.
Strait-laced, top-of-the-class.

00:07:36.164 --> 00:07:37.374 position:50% align:center
And she also happens to be

00:07:37.457 --> 00:07:40.835 position:50% align:center
a self-important, authoritarian
pain in the ass.

00:07:40.919 --> 00:07:42.921 position:50% align:center
So exposing herself
to ridicule like this

00:07:43.004 --> 00:07:44.714 position:50% align:center
is a bold move on her part.

00:07:44.798 --> 00:07:46.925 position:50% align:center
She annoys tons of
people on the daily.

00:07:47.008 --> 00:07:51.429 position:50% align:center
They might even feel
justified laughing at her.

00:07:51.513 --> 00:07:54.724 position:50% align:center
I get it because I have
reasons to resent her, too.

00:07:57.227 --> 00:08:02.482 position:50% align:center
[STUDENTS laughing]

00:08:02.565 --> 00:08:04.901 position:50% align:center
But still, it pisses me off.

00:08:04.984 --> 00:08:08.363 position:50% align:center
She shouldn't get laughed
at for caring so much.

00:08:08.446 --> 00:08:09.906 position:50% align:center
That isn't right.

00:08:09.989 --> 00:08:11.700 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI]
Leave it to me.

00:08:13.118 --> 00:08:16.996 position:50% align:center
We'll beat her, but in a way
that's honorable and fair.

Are your parents here, Miko?

00:08:29.134 --> 00:08:33.388 position:50% align:center
[MIKO] No. Mama is busy
distributing vaccines.

00:08:33.471 --> 00:08:36.391 position:50% align:center
And Papa has to work late
hours at the courthouse.

00:08:36.474 --> 00:08:39.644 position:50% align:center
They both have
very important jobs.

00:08:39.728 --> 00:08:42.897 position:50% align:center
But don't you get kind of lonely
if you're at home all alone?

00:08:42.981 --> 00:08:45.066 position:50% align:center
Yes.

You handle it much
better than I would.

00:08:48.862 --> 00:08:51.656 position:50% align:center
It's not their fault, you know?

00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:53.450 position:50% align:center
The world is full of bad people,

00:08:53.533 --> 00:08:55.827 position:50% align:center
and the more there are,
the less I see my parents

00:08:55.910 --> 00:08:58.830 position:50% align:center
because they have
to deal with them.

just follow the rules!

[OSARAGI]
Miko is a very serious person.

00:09:06.254 --> 00:09:09.007 position:50% align:center
In elementary school, she'd get
to class early every morning

00:09:09.090 --> 00:09:13.303 position:50% align:center

00:16:03.463 --> 00:16:05.423 position:50% align:center
But it's all okay now.

00:16:05.507 --> 00:16:07.384 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA]
That's not it.

00:16:07.467 --> 00:16:09.135 position:50% align:center
[HAYASAKA]
Maybe you're just tired.

00:16:09.219 --> 00:16:12.806 position:50% align:center
I know you haven't been sleeping
well these past few nights.

00:16:12.889 --> 00:16:15.392 position:50% align:center
And you've been working so hard.

00:16:15.475 --> 00:16:17.686 position:50% align:center
--You can lean on me for...
--[CHIKA] Kaguya!

00:16:19.229 --> 00:16:21.064 position:50% align:center
Are you okay? What happened?

00:16:21.147 --> 00:16:25.568 position:50% align:center
Is it your stomach again?
Darn you, Miyuki!

00:16:26.861 --> 00:16:29.280 position:50% align:center
I hope you won't hold
a grudge against me.

00:16:29.364 --> 00:16:31.032 position:50% align:center
I tried to fight fair.

00:16:31.116 --> 00:16:32.784 position:50% align:center
[MIKO]
Are you kidding me?

00:16:32.867 --> 00:16:34.160 position:50% align:center
If you hadn't stepped
in when you did,

00:16:34.244 --> 00:16:36.204 position:50% align:center
I would've stayed frozen
behind that podium

00:16:36.287 --> 00:16:38.623 position:50% align:center
and nobody would've
heard about my ideals.

00:16:38.707 --> 00:16:41.001 position:50% align:center
I don't think I can
thank you enough.

00:16:41.084 --> 00:16:42.210 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI]
Uh-huh.

00:16:42.293 --> 00:16:46.923 position:50% align:center
You say that... but your
face says otherwise.

00:16:47.007 --> 00:16:50.593 position:50% align:center
It's a complex mix of
gratefulness and frustration.

00:16:50.677 --> 00:16:52.762 position:50% align:center
Well, all that aside,

00:16:52.846 --> 00:16:55.932 position:50% align:center
would you two be interested
in joining Student Council?

00:16:57.892 --> 00:16:59.728 position:50% align:center
If you're thinking of
running again in the future,

00:16:59.811 --> 00:17:01.855 position:50% align:center
it'd be good to get some
practical experience

00:17:01.938 --> 00:17:02.814 position:50% align:center
under your belt.

00:17:02.897 --> 00:17:03.565 position:50% align:center
What do you say?

00:17:03.648 --> 00:17:04.649 position:50% align:center
[OSARAGI]
No thanks.

00:17:04.733 --> 00:17:06.526 position:50% align:center
If I'm being honest here,

00:17:06.609 --> 00:17:08.778 position:50% align:center
Student Council holds
no interest for me.

00:17:08.862 --> 00:17:10.447 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI]
Huh? Really?

00:17:10.530 --> 00:17:11.364 position:50% align:center
[OSARAGI]
I was only doing this

00:17:11.448 --> 00:17:13.742 position:50% align:center
because I wanted
to support Miko.

00:17:13.825 --> 00:17:15.076 position:50% align:center
Of course.

00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:17.996 position:50% align:center
I completely understand
where you're coming from.

00:17:18.079 --> 00:17:19.497 position:50% align:center
How about you?

00:17:19.581 --> 00:17:21.541 position:50% align:center
I... don't know.

00:17:21.624 --> 00:17:25.211 position:50% align:center
This is the first time I've been
invited to join a council.

00:17:27.339 --> 00:17:30.258 position:50% align:center
Please give me a little
time to think about it.

00:17:30.342 --> 00:17:31.468 position:50% align:center
Fair enough.

00:17:31.551 --> 00:17:33.136 position:50% align:center
Come to the Student
Council office tomorrow

00:17:33.219 --> 00:17:34.304 position:50% align:center
if you choose to join.

00:17:34.387 --> 00:17:35.555 position:50% align:center
Sound good?

00:17:35.638 --> 00:17:37.140 position:50% align:center
[MIKO]
Mh-hm.

00:17:40.060 --> 00:17:41.227 position:50% align:center
One last thing.

00:17:41.311 --> 00:17:43.730 position:50% align:center
You've got some fidgety
creepers behind you.

00:17:43.813 --> 00:17:46.524 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI]
Hm? Uh... Something wrong?

00:17:46.608 --> 00:17:49.069 position:50% align:center
[CHIKA]
Well, no. But, uh...

00:17:49.152 --> 00:17:51.029 position:50% align:center
There are a few other
seats on your council

00:17:51.112 --> 00:17:54.991 position:50% align:center
that need to be filled, so...
we were just wondering, um...

00:17:55.075 --> 00:17:56.201 position:50% align:center
As you know, both of us have

00:17:56.284 --> 00:17:58.953 position:50% align:center
severely dysfunctional
personalities.

00:17:59.037 --> 00:18:01.206 position:50% align:center
We're worried you won't
pick us again. That's all.

00:18:01.289 --> 00:18:02.707 position:50% align:center
What he said!

00:18:02.791 --> 00:18:04.751 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI] I think my secretary
and treasurer should have

00:18:04.834 --> 00:18:08.213 position:50% align:center
a bit more composure,
wouldn't you agree?

00:18:08.296 --> 00:18:11.633 position:50% align:center
Our first job as the
new Student Council

00:18:11.716 --> 00:18:14.469 position:50% align:center
will be cleaning up the
gym, so let's hop to it.

00:18:14.552 --> 00:18:16.888 position:50% align:center
[CHIKA chuckles]

00:18:16.971 --> 00:18:18.181 position:50% align:center
[CHIKA, YU]
Right!

00:18:25.021 --> 00:18:28.358 position:50% align:center
Why hasn't the president
come to check on me yet?

00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:31.528 position:50% align:center
When he heard that I fainted,

00:18:31.611 --> 00:18:32.862 position:50% align:center
shouldn't he have
dropped everything

00:18:32.946 --> 00:18:34.614 position:50% align:center
and come running
to take care of me?!

00:18:34.698 --> 00:18:35.865 position:50% align:center
He just won an election

00:18:35.949 --> 00:18:37.575 position:50% align:center
and has the "privilege"
of cleaning up after,

00:18:37.659 --> 00:18:39.911 position:50% align:center
so he'll probably come
when he's done.

00:18:39.994 --> 00:18:41.413 position:50% align:center
Oh my gosh.

00:18:41.496 --> 00:18:44.666 position:50% align:center
What if he doesn't want me
to be on his council anymore?

00:18:44.749 --> 00:18:46.418 position:50% align:center
[HAYASAKA] It's astonishing
how much control

00:18:46.501 --> 00:18:48.378 position:50% align:center
your mind has over your body.

00:18:48.461 --> 00:18:50.672 position:50% align:center
Are you actually
concerned about that?

00:18:50.755 --> 00:18:53.425 position:50% align:center
You know full well what
my personality is like.

00:18:53.508 --> 00:18:55.719 position:50% align:center
What if the president discovered
the shady things I did

00:18:55.802 --> 00:18:59.014 position:50% align:center
to make the other candidate
drop out of the election?

00:18:59.097 --> 00:19:03.393 position:50% align:center
Or that I pestered a handful
of clubs into voting for him?

00:19:03.476 --> 00:19:04.853 position:50% align:center
Oh, no!

00:19:04.936 --> 00:19:06.271 position:50% align:center
What if he knows the members
of the election committee

00:19:06.354 --> 00:19:07.731 position:50% align:center
are my puppets?

00:19:07.814 --> 00:19:09.607 position:50% align:center
[HAYASAKA] Jeez, you really
went all out, didn't you?

00:19:09.691 --> 00:19:11.776 position:50% align:center
I mean, he only ran
because I asked him to,

00:19:11.860 --> 00:19:13.653 position:50% align:center
so of course I did!

00:19:13.737 --> 00:19:15.572 position:50% align:center
I promised myself I'd
do everything I could

00:19:15.655 --> 00:19:17.323 position:50% align:center
to get him re-elected.

00:19:17.407 --> 00:19:20.535 position:50% align:center
Wasn't that a logical decision?

00:19:20.618 --> 00:19:22.287 position:50% align:center
Well, you're a
paranoid mess now,

00:19:22.370 --> 00:19:25.874 position:50% align:center
so I don't think the juice was
worth the squeeze in this case.

00:19:25.957 --> 00:19:28.877 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA] I'm a horrible girl
who relied on foul play to win.

00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:30.503 position:50% align:center
If he doesn't want me
for Student Council,

00:19:30.587 --> 00:19:32.422 position:50% align:center
I can't say I blame him.

00:19:32.505 --> 00:19:35.508 position:50% align:center
Except I have every right to
blame him if he does that to me!

00:19:35.592 --> 00:19:36.926 position:50% align:center
Did you see what he
did with those votes

00:19:37.010 --> 00:19:38.678 position:50% align:center
we worked so hard
to scrounge up?

00:19:38.762 --> 00:19:40.096 position:50% align:center
Did you?!

00:19:40.180 --> 00:19:41.556 position:50% align:center
He just chucked 'em out the
first open window he saw

00:19:41.639 --> 00:19:43.641 position:50% align:center
without so much as
a second thought!

00:19:43.725 --> 00:19:45.143 position:50% align:center
[yells]

00:19:45.226 --> 00:19:46.770 position:50% align:center
He's like a typical
good-for-nothing husband

00:19:46.853 --> 00:19:48.605 position:50% align:center
whose wife works a
part-time job every night,

00:19:48.688 --> 00:19:49.981 position:50% align:center
but then he takes her
money and uses it

00:19:50.065 --> 00:19:53.276 position:50% align:center
for gambling, sex
workers, and booze!

00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:55.236 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA breathing heavily]

00:19:55.320 --> 00:19:56.863 position:50% align:center
It'll be fine.

00:19:56.946 --> 00:19:58.573 position:50% align:center
He asked you to write
his campaign speech.

00:19:58.656 --> 00:20:00.533 position:50% align:center
He wouldn't have done that if he
didn't want you on his council.

00:20:00.617 --> 00:20:02.160 position:50% align:center
I'm the kind of woman
that gets used up

00:20:02.243 --> 00:20:03.620 position:50% align:center
and thrown out like
a piece of trash

00:20:03.703 --> 00:20:04.913 position:50% align:center
once I've served my purpose!

00:20:04.996 --> 00:20:07.540 position:50% align:center
[HAYASAKA] Anxious one
second, angry the next.

00:20:07.624 --> 00:20:08.708 position:50% align:center
You're hopeless.

00:20:08.792 --> 00:20:11.002 position:50% align:center
I actually fooled
myself into thinking

00:20:11.086 --> 00:20:12.545 position:50% align:center
the president liked me.

00:20:12.629 --> 00:20:16.383 position:50% align:center
I thought he was nice to me
because I was special.

00:20:16.466 --> 00:20:19.803 position:50% align:center
But I was wrong.
He's nice to everybody.

00:20:19.886 --> 00:20:23.264 position:50% align:center
He'll lend a helping hand
to anyone who needs it.

00:20:23.348 --> 00:20:26.101 position:50% align:center
I was never someone
special to him.

00:20:28.645 --> 00:20:30.230 position:50% align:center
[HAYASAKA gasps]

00:20:30.313 --> 00:20:32.065 position:50% align:center
Since you've got so much to say,

00:20:32.148 --> 00:20:34.317 position:50% align:center
why don't you go ahead
and tell him face to face?

00:20:34.401 --> 00:20:36.736 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA gasps]

00:20:36.820 --> 00:20:39.364 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI] Shinomiya,
how are you feeling?

00:20:39.447 --> 00:20:40.782 position:50% align:center
Sorry.

00:20:42.450 --> 00:20:45.161 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI] Cleaning up took longer
than I thought it would.

00:20:50.417 --> 00:20:53.795 position:50% align:center
Are you... angry with me?

00:20:53.878 --> 00:20:55.630 position:50% align:center
Of course you are.

00:20:55.714 --> 00:20:58.550 position:50% align:center
I threw away your hard work
by acting on impulse.

00:20:58.633 --> 00:21:01.177 position:50% align:center
I feel bad about it, but...

00:21:01.261 --> 00:21:04.055 position:50% align:center
I only did it because
I had Fujiwara, Ishigami,

00:21:04.139 --> 00:21:06.224 position:50% align:center
and you in my corner.

00:21:06.307 --> 00:21:07.976 position:50% align:center
That was advantage enough.

00:21:08.059 --> 00:21:12.230 position:50% align:center
Knowing I was already ahead,
I couldn't just let Iino drown.

00:21:12.313 --> 00:21:14.607 position:50% align:center
I'm kinda useless on my own.

00:21:14.691 --> 00:21:16.609 position:50% align:center
But when I have you
and the others around,

00:21:16.693 --> 00:21:19.279 position:50% align:center
it's like I can do anything.

00:21:19.362 --> 00:21:23.783 position:50% align:center
That's why... I want you
to be my vice president.

00:21:23.867 --> 00:21:26.911 position:50% align:center
I need you, Shinomiya.

00:21:26.995 --> 00:21:28.329 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA gasps]

00:21:35.879 --> 00:21:37.881 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI gasps]

00:21:37.964 --> 00:21:39.174 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI]
Yes!

00:21:46.514 --> 00:21:48.099 position:50% align:center
Well, would you look at that?

00:21:48.183 --> 00:21:51.019 position:50% align:center
You got your special
treatment after all.

00:22:06.242 --> 00:22:07.702 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI]
Okay!

00:22:08.912 --> 00:22:11.122 position:50% align:center
The election is over
and done with.

00:22:11.206 --> 00:22:14.167 position:50% align:center
Time to get back to
the real work, guys!

00:22:14.250 --> 00:22:16.252 position:50% align:center
We've got sports day,
the school festival,

00:22:16.336 --> 00:22:18.880 position:50% align:center
and the school trip
after New Year's!

00:22:18.963 --> 00:22:21.383 position:50% align:center
Our second term is shaping
up to be a busy one,

00:22:21.466 --> 00:22:22.592 position:50% align:center
so brace yourselves!

00:22:22.676 --> 00:22:23.885 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA, YU, CHIKA]
Right!

The result of this election:

00:22:29.599 --> 00:22:32.435 position:50% align:center

a new member.
