Sorry about this, President.

00:01:15.825 --> 00:01:18.953 position:50% align:center
But it's for the

you have to guard
this room with your life

The art of controlling people!

To accomplish this, you need to

read their train of thought,

00:03:08.855 --> 00:03:10.774 position:50% align:center

They say you'll
notice changes in a boy

if you haven't seen
him in three days.

00:04:51.416 --> 00:04:53.126 position:50% align:center
Therefore, differences
are even more obvious

00:04:53.209 --> 00:04:54.836 position:50% align:center
if you haven't seen
him in over a month.

00:04:54.919 --> 00:04:57.130 position:50% align:center
Slowly but surely,
various internal deviations

00:04:57.213 --> 00:04:59.883 position:50% align:center
begin to manifest,
uhh, externally.

00:04:59.966 --> 00:05:01.593 position:50% align:center
How?! What caused this?!

00:05:01.676 --> 00:05:03.511 position:50% align:center
It's kinda funny how
you pointed that out,

00:05:03.595 --> 00:05:04.846 position:50% align:center
because it's a
big part of the reason

00:05:04.929 --> 00:05:06.514 position:50% align:center
I wanted to talk to you, Prez.

00:05:06.598 --> 00:05:08.350 position:50% align:center
Okay then, let's talk.

00:05:08.433 --> 00:05:11.519 position:50% align:center

I could make myself scarce.

You don't have to do that, bro.

00:05:13.229 --> 00:05:16.358 position:50% align:center

you to listen in.

Right.

00:05:17.567 --> 00:05:18.777 position:50% align:center
So what's the problem now?

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:20.820 position:50% align:center
Well, it's about Nagisa.

00:05:20.904 --> 00:05:22.489 position:50% align:center
That's my girlfriend,
in case you forgot.

to toss that out there.

I thought you two
were hitting it off.

[TSUBASA] Mm... Uhh, who's
really the judge of that?

00:05:32.832 --> 00:05:35.293 position:50% align:center
I guess it's so-so.

00:05:35.377 --> 00:05:38.129 position:50% align:center
[YU] President, his mouth
is saying things are "so-so,"

00:05:38.213 --> 00:05:40.674 position:50% align:center
but his face is practically
screaming it's going great!

00:05:40.757 --> 00:05:42.217 position:50% align:center
True.

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:44.928 position:50% align:center
Honestly, y'know what I think?

00:05:45.011 --> 00:05:47.681 position:50% align:center
He's not having problems with
his girlfriend. He's gloating!

00:05:47.764 --> 00:05:49.974 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI]
I highly doubt that's the case.

00:05:50.058 --> 00:05:53.311 position:50% align:center
I'm sure he'll address
the issue any moment now.

00:05:53.395 --> 00:05:55.188 position:50% align:center
I guess you could say...

00:05:55.271 --> 00:05:56.690 position:50% align:center
Summer vacation might have been

00:05:56.773 --> 00:06:00.193 position:50% align:center
a little too amazing
if you catch my drift.

like, now whadda we do?

00:06:06.366 --> 00:06:09.369 position:50% align:center
[YU] I knew it!
He is just here to gloat!

Okay.

00:06:14.666 --> 00:06:16.126 position:50% align:center
So what you're asking me is how

00:06:16.209 --> 00:06:18.503 position:50% align:center
to get to the next step
in your relationship, right?

00:06:18.586 --> 00:06:20.171 position:50% align:center
I mean more or less.

00:06:20.255 --> 00:06:23.341 position:50% align:center
Yeah. I wonder how high
up this stairway goes.

[YU gasps]
President.

00:06:25.468 --> 00:06:27.637 position:50% align:center
I don't think he has
any steps left to climb.

Then you've read
this boy all wrong.

00:06:29.597 --> 00:06:31.266 position:50% align:center
There's no way they
would've gone that far.

They've only been
together for four months!

On top of that, they spent
summer vacation together!

It's entirely
possible the two of them

00:06:51.995 --> 00:06:54.622 position:50% align:center
have shared a little
piece of heaven.

00:06:54.706 --> 00:06:58.043 position:50% align:center
This summer vacation had to
have been the best one yet!

00:06:58.126 --> 00:07:00.754 position:50% align:center
Something tells me you enjoyed
it just as much as I did!

00:07:00.837 --> 00:07:02.213 position:50% align:center
Actually, I didn't do anything

00:07:02.297 --> 00:07:04.424 position:50% align:center

and work every day.

We'll be back soon.

00:07:54.808 --> 00:07:57.477 position:50% align:center
Uh... sure.

00:07:57.560 --> 00:07:58.561 position:50% align:center
Just wait.

00:07:58.645 --> 00:08:00.313 position:50% align:center
Because it's only
a matter of time.

00:08:00.397 --> 00:08:02.691 position:50% align:center
A couple that's been to
seventh heaven will start acting

00:08:02.774 --> 00:08:05.360 position:50% align:center
all lovey-dovey the
second they're alone.

00:08:06.945 --> 00:08:08.822 position:50% align:center
Watch them and
you'll see what I mean.

00:08:08.905 --> 00:08:10.115 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI]
Uh, right.

00:08:10.198 --> 00:08:11.324 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA]
Excuse me.

00:08:11.408 --> 00:08:13.618 position:50% align:center
We'd like to go inside,
if you don't mind.

00:08:13.702 --> 00:08:15.412 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI yelps]
Hi!

00:08:15.495 --> 00:08:17.122 position:50% align:center
What exactly are you doing?

00:08:17.205 --> 00:08:19.332 position:50% align:center
We're investigating
the couple in the room

00:08:19.416 --> 00:08:20.834 position:50% align:center
to see if they've
tasted nirvana.

00:08:20.917 --> 00:08:23.420 position:50% align:center
[CHIKA gasps] You can tell
if they've gone that far?!

00:08:23.503 --> 00:08:25.130 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI]
I'm surprised she gets it.

00:08:25.213 --> 00:08:27.048 position:50% align:center
One in three people!

00:08:27.132 --> 00:08:29.092 position:50% align:center
What does "tasted nirvana" mean?

00:08:29.175 --> 00:08:31.428 position:50% align:center
[CHIKA gasps] I think
in this instance it means

00:08:31.511 --> 00:08:34.806 position:50% align:center
they got a little freaky
and did the divine deed.

00:08:34.889 --> 00:08:37.767 position:50% align:center
[YU gasps]
They're holding hands!

00:08:37.851 --> 00:08:39.310 position:50% align:center
Are you convinced now?

00:08:39.394 --> 00:08:40.395 position:50% align:center
No.

00:08:40.478 --> 00:08:41.563 position:50% align:center
Hand holding is something

00:08:41.646 --> 00:08:43.314 position:50% align:center
you can pull as early
as the first date!

00:08:43.398 --> 00:08:46.317 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA] The president
holds hands on a first date?

00:08:46.401 --> 00:08:48.695 position:50% align:center
Huh? [gasps]

00:08:48.778 --> 00:08:51.531 position:50% align:center
Oh my gosh! She kissed him!

00:08:51.614 --> 00:08:53.074 position:50% align:center
They've definitely shaboinked!

00:08:53.158 --> 00:08:54.451 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI]
We don't know that!

00:08:54.534 --> 00:08:56.536 position:50% align:center
I bet kissing happens
by the third date!

00:08:56.619 --> 00:08:59.289 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA]
By the third date?

00:08:59.372 --> 00:09:01.583 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA gasps]

00:09:01.666 --> 00:09:04.711 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA] He's caressing her
face and nibbling her neck!

00:09:04.794 --> 00:09:06.254 position:50% align:center
[YU] You're kidding
yourself if you still think

00:09:06.338 --> 00:09:08.256 position:50% align:center
they haven't experienced
the beast with two backs!

00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:09.966 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI] No! You can
do that kind of stuff

00:09:10.050 --> 00:09:10.925 position:50% align:center
on the fourth date!

00:09:11.009 --> 00:09:13.094 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA]
He's trying to kill me!

00:09:15.263 --> 00:09:17.432 position:50% align:center
On what number date
do you go all the way?!

00:09:17.515 --> 00:09:19.017 position:50% align:center
Date five!

00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:21.019 position:50% align:center
[CHIKA screaming]

00:09:21.102 --> 00:09:22.437 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:09:25.774 --> 00:09:28.109 position:50% align:center
--[MIYUKI] Shinomiya!
--[CHIKA] Are you okay?

00:09:28.193 --> 00:09:28.943 position:50% align:center
[YU]
What happened?!

00:09:29.027 --> 00:09:30.904 position:50% align:center
Hi. Gotcha!

00:09:30.987 --> 00:09:32.739 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI]
Fancy seeing you here!

00:09:32.822 --> 00:09:34.699 position:50% align:center
We were just about to head in.

00:09:34.783 --> 00:09:36.159 position:50% align:center
I'm sure.

00:09:36.242 --> 00:09:38.620 position:50% align:center
But I'd like to
apologize before you do.

00:09:38.703 --> 00:09:41.331 position:50% align:center
Despite what you think,
we haven't gotten that far,

00:09:41.414 --> 00:09:43.625 position:50% align:center
but we knew you were
watching so we played it up.

00:09:43.708 --> 00:09:45.043 position:50% align:center
Sorry we tricked you.

00:09:45.126 --> 00:09:47.212 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI] For the record,
I-I didn't think that!

00:09:47.295 --> 00:09:49.673 position:50% align:center
It's still too early.

00:09:49.756 --> 00:09:51.424 position:50% align:center
[NAGISA]
Yes.

00:09:51.508 --> 00:09:53.551 position:50% align:center
Of course.

00:09:53.635 --> 00:09:55.637 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI]
Or maybe it's not!

00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:57.889 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR]
The results for today's battle:

00:09:57.972 --> 00:10:00.016 position:50% align:center
The student council loses.

00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:02.477 position:50% align:center
I told him I had a thing
for confident, bad-boy types,

00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:05.188 position:50% align:center
and he's been working really
hard to be one ever since!

00:10:05.271 --> 00:10:07.399 position:50% align:center
He's obedient like that.

00:10:08.775 --> 00:10:12.487 position:50% align:center
We made a fun new game
at the Tabletop Game club!

00:10:13.154 --> 00:10:14.864 position:50% align:center
So... you came
up with it yourself?

00:10:14.948 --> 00:10:17.158 position:50% align:center
[CHIKA] Mm-hmm!
It's a game that uses cards!

00:10:17.242 --> 00:10:20.036 position:50% align:center
You put them out in lines and
each one represents a square!

00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:22.372 position:50% align:center
[YU] I admit, it sounds
pretty interesting.

00:10:22.455 --> 00:10:24.874 position:50% align:center
[CHIKA] We call it
the "Happy Life Game!"

00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:26.459 position:50% align:center
We should all play it together!

00:10:26.543 --> 00:10:27.293 position:50% align:center
--[KAGUYA] No, thanks.
--[MIYUKI] Pass.

00:10:27.377 --> 00:10:28.461 position:50% align:center
[CHIKA shrieks]

00:10:28.545 --> 00:10:29.838 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR]
The results for today's battle:

00:10:29.921 --> 00:10:31.047 position:50% align:center
Nothing!

00:10:31.131 --> 00:10:33.299 position:50% align:center
I have this sinking
feeling about that game.

00:10:33.383 --> 00:10:34.509 position:50% align:center
'Cause you know nothing good

00:10:34.592 --> 00:10:36.344 position:50% align:center
could come out of a game
created by Fujiwara.

00:10:36.428 --> 00:10:37.929 position:50% align:center
[CHIKA]
I promise it's fine!

00:10:38.013 --> 00:10:39.556 position:50% align:center
I'm not the only
one who made it!

00:10:39.639 --> 00:10:41.558 position:50% align:center
It was a group effort
by the whole club!

00:10:41.641 --> 00:10:43.601 position:50% align:center
Oh, come on. She
went to the trouble

00:10:43.685 --> 00:10:45.562 position:50% align:center
of making something
fun for us to do.

00:10:45.645 --> 00:10:47.147 position:50% align:center
We could at least try it.

00:10:47.230 --> 00:10:51.776 position:50% align:center
You do have a heart,
don't you? [whimpers]

00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:54.946 position:50% align:center
You're actually a super
nice guy underneath it all!

00:10:55.030 --> 00:10:56.614 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry for thinking
you were a bully

00:10:56.698 --> 00:10:59.325 position:50% align:center
who uses logic like a
weapon to beat girls down!

00:10:59.409 --> 00:11:01.244 position:50% align:center
That's seriously how
you thought of me?

00:11:01.327 --> 00:11:04.122 position:50% align:center
Maybe if you had thicker skin,
I wouldn't get to you so much.

00:11:04.205 --> 00:11:05.206 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA]
All right, fine.

00:11:05.290 --> 00:11:06.666 position:50% align:center
--[CHIKA gasps]
--[MIYUKI sighs]

00:11:06.750 --> 00:11:08.418 position:50% align:center
But only one round.

00:11:08.501 --> 00:11:10.420 position:50% align:center
[CHIKA]
Yay!

00:11:11.588 --> 00:11:12.756 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR]
Board games!

00:11:12.839 --> 00:11:14.549 position:50% align:center
A pastime with a rich history

00:11:14.632 --> 00:11:17.427 position:50% align:center
that can be traced back
as far as ancient Egypt.

00:11:17.510 --> 00:11:20.180 position:50% align:center
The game Fujiwara and her
fellow club members created

00:11:20.263 --> 00:11:23.725 position:50% align:center
uses cards as squares, but is
otherwise a typical board game

00:11:23.808 --> 00:11:25.352 position:50% align:center
where the player who
earns the most money

00:11:25.435 --> 00:11:26.686 position:50% align:center
is declared the winner.

00:11:26.770 --> 00:11:29.230 position:50% align:center
Okay. I guess I'll go first.

00:11:31.024 --> 00:11:33.276 position:50% align:center
[YU]
"Misfortune"?

00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:36.196 position:50% align:center
Now you flip over the card--
the one you landed on!

00:11:36.279 --> 00:11:37.697 position:50% align:center
[YU]
Hmm.

00:11:37.781 --> 00:11:39.991 position:50% align:center
[CHIKA]
Ooh, a Car Accident card!

00:11:40.075 --> 00:11:42.911 position:50% align:center
That means you have to roll the
die again, and if it's a one--

00:11:42.994 --> 00:11:44.037 position:50% align:center
[YU]
It's a one.

00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:46.081 position:50% align:center
Then, that means
you died, Ishigami.

00:11:46.164 --> 00:11:47.749 position:50% align:center
What happens when you die?

00:11:47.832 --> 00:11:50.877 position:50% align:center
Other than losing the game and
being in last place, nothing.

00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:52.337 position:50% align:center
Ah, I see.

00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:54.381 position:50% align:center
Proceed with caution, you two.

00:11:54.464 --> 00:11:56.299 position:50% align:center
This game is a
steaming pile of crap.

00:11:56.383 --> 00:11:57.634 position:50% align:center
And you're surprised?

00:11:57.717 --> 00:12:00.261 position:50% align:center
Hey! Don't hate the
game, hate the player!

00:12:00.345 --> 00:12:02.097 position:50% align:center
--That makes it my turn.
--[YU] Can I see the rule book

00:12:02.180 --> 00:12:02.972 position:50% align:center
[YU]
for a sec?

00:12:03.056 --> 00:12:04.391 position:50% align:center
[CHIKA]
Here.

00:12:07.686 --> 00:12:09.854 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI]
It says, "After School Event."

00:12:09.938 --> 00:12:12.107 position:50% align:center
Okay. That means
you have to choose.

00:12:12.190 --> 00:12:15.110 position:50% align:center
You can either hang out after
school or go home and study!

00:12:15.193 --> 00:12:16.611 position:50% align:center
I would rather study.

00:12:16.695 --> 00:12:19.239 position:50% align:center
[CHIKA chuckles]
Of course you would.

00:12:19.322 --> 00:12:23.118 position:50% align:center
And with that, I bestow upon
you the Nerdy Student card!

00:12:23.201 --> 00:12:24.911 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI]
Is this a joke?

00:12:24.994 --> 00:12:27.122 position:50% align:center
I landed on a Lucky square,
whatever that is.

00:12:27.205 --> 00:12:28.707 position:50% align:center
[CHIKA gasps]

00:12:28.790 --> 00:12:31.042 position:50% align:center
Brace yourself because something
lucky is about to happen to you!

00:12:31.126 --> 00:12:33.420 position:50% align:center
Originally, you were
deceived by an evil man,

00:12:33.503 --> 00:12:34.963 position:50% align:center
but it works out in the end

00:12:35.046 --> 00:12:37.298 position:50% align:center
when you get ten million in
cold, hard cash from a lawsuit!

00:12:37.382 --> 00:12:39.300 position:50% align:center
I am failing to see
the luck in this.

00:12:39.384 --> 00:12:43.096 position:50% align:center
I bestow upon you
the Distrusts All Men card!

00:12:43.179 --> 00:12:44.597 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA]
I don't want it.

00:12:44.681 --> 00:12:46.641 position:50% align:center
[CHIKA] The squares
you land on are removed.

00:12:46.725 --> 00:12:48.184 position:50% align:center
That way the players
further behind

00:12:48.268 --> 00:12:49.644 position:50% align:center
have a chance to catch up!

00:12:49.728 --> 00:12:52.105 position:50% align:center
[YU] Well, at least this
game has some good ideas.

00:12:52.188 --> 00:12:53.732 position:50% align:center
Which makes me wonder
what part of the game

00:12:53.815 --> 00:12:54.899 position:50% align:center
you were put in charge of.

00:12:54.983 --> 00:12:56.234 position:50% align:center
It was my job to come up with

00:12:56.317 --> 00:12:58.153 position:50% align:center
all of the events
that take place!

00:12:58.236 --> 00:13:00.739 position:50% align:center
Figures. But why
are you so proud?

00:13:00.822 --> 00:13:01.823 position:50% align:center
Aren't you the
least bit ashamed?

00:13:01.906 --> 00:13:02.991 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:13:03.074 --> 00:13:04.617 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR]
And thus the game carries on!

00:13:04.701 --> 00:13:06.161 position:50% align:center
Thanks to his
Nerdy Student card,

00:13:06.244 --> 00:13:08.455 position:50% align:center
Shirogane gets into
a first-rate college.

00:13:08.538 --> 00:13:10.123 position:50% align:center
But Kaguya continues
to earn money

00:13:10.206 --> 00:13:12.834 position:50% align:center
by landing on Lucky squares,
putting her in the lead.

00:13:12.917 --> 00:13:14.377 position:50% align:center
They've passed the Child Zone

00:13:14.461 --> 00:13:16.838 position:50% align:center
and are currently
in the Adult Zone.

00:13:16.921 --> 00:13:18.423 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA]
Hmm.

00:13:18.506 --> 00:13:21.343 position:50% align:center
This game turned out to be a lot
better than I thought it would.

00:13:21.426 --> 00:13:23.887 position:50% align:center
It seems like everybody who
had a hand in working on this

00:13:23.970 --> 00:13:25.430 position:50% align:center
actually thought it through.

00:13:25.513 --> 00:13:28.016 position:50% align:center
Everybody apart from
Fujiwara, that is.

00:13:28.099 --> 00:13:29.059 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR]
She's right.

00:13:29.142 --> 00:13:30.393 position:50% align:center
These are the two
true masterminds

00:13:30.477 --> 00:13:32.103 position:50% align:center
behind "Happy Life Game."

00:13:32.187 --> 00:13:34.147 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI]
Huh? What's this?

00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:36.066 position:50% align:center
That'd be a Marriage
square, I believe.

00:13:36.149 --> 00:13:37.442 position:50% align:center
Landing on it means

00:13:37.525 --> 00:13:39.486 position:50% align:center
you have to marry the
player who's closest to you.

00:13:39.569 --> 00:13:40.904 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA]
Marriage?!

00:13:40.987 --> 00:13:42.739 position:50% align:center
Married players then share
the effects of the squares

00:13:42.822 --> 00:13:44.741 position:50% align:center
they land on for the
remainder of the game.

00:13:44.824 --> 00:13:46.785 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA]
The president is tying the knot?

00:13:46.868 --> 00:13:48.745 position:50% align:center
But who's his bride?

00:13:48.828 --> 00:13:50.789 position:50% align:center
[CHIKA]
Ooh, would you look at that?

00:13:50.872 --> 00:13:53.500 position:50% align:center
I'm the closest one to him!

00:13:54.501 --> 00:13:56.878 position:50% align:center
[CHIKA giggles]
What's mine is yours, President,

00:13:56.961 --> 00:13:59.214 position:50% align:center
because we just
sealed the deal forever!

00:13:59.297 --> 00:14:00.340 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA]
They really did it.

00:14:00.423 --> 00:14:02.634 position:50% align:center
They got married!

00:14:02.717 --> 00:14:05.512 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA cries]

00:14:05.595 --> 00:14:07.764 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA] No. I have
to get a hold of myself!

00:14:07.847 --> 00:14:10.517 position:50% align:center
It's only a silly
game after all!

00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:12.268 position:50% align:center
This is a pretend
marriage, nothing more!

00:14:12.352 --> 00:14:13.687 position:50% align:center
[YU] Oh, and the
other players have to

00:14:13.770 --> 00:14:15.355 position:50% align:center
give them 50 thousand yen.

00:14:15.438 --> 00:14:18.066 position:50% align:center
Consider it a gift
to the newlyweds.

00:14:20.777 --> 00:14:23.738 position:50% align:center
[YU] Uh... I didn't
mean actual money.

00:14:25.865 --> 00:14:29.953 position:50% align:center
The company I founded thrives.
Collect ten million yen.

00:14:30.036 --> 00:14:31.871 position:50% align:center
I'm so lucky.

00:14:31.955 --> 00:14:33.998 position:50% align:center
Ah! I landed on a Birth square!

00:14:34.082 --> 00:14:35.625 position:50% align:center
Now we have a baby!

00:14:35.709 --> 00:14:37.293 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA]
No way!

00:14:37.377 --> 00:14:39.087 position:50% align:center
Who would've thought
that becoming a teen mom

00:14:39.170 --> 00:14:40.630 position:50% align:center
was in the cards for me?

00:14:40.714 --> 00:14:43.675 position:50% align:center
[YU] Other players must gift
them a hundred thousand yen.

00:14:43.758 --> 00:14:46.469 position:50% align:center
Please, put away your
real money, Vice President.

00:14:47.470 --> 00:14:50.015 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA] My company
was in the first section

00:14:50.098 --> 00:14:51.558 position:50% align:center
of the stock exchange.

00:14:51.641 --> 00:14:53.059 position:50% align:center
Luckiest turn ever.

00:14:53.143 --> 00:14:55.937 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR] Next, the players
move into the Old Age Zone.

00:14:56.021 --> 00:14:58.314 position:50% align:center
We have enough children
for a baseball team!

00:14:58.398 --> 00:15:01.026 position:50% align:center
I've gotta admit, I'm impressed
by your stamina, Prez.

00:15:01.109 --> 00:15:02.861 position:50% align:center
She's the one who's
landing on them!

00:15:02.944 --> 00:15:04.946 position:50% align:center
You're having an
amazing game, Kaguya!

00:15:05.030 --> 00:15:07.574 position:50% align:center
A renowned president
of a global corporation?

00:15:07.657 --> 00:15:09.451 position:50% align:center
Talk about a huge success!

00:15:09.534 --> 00:15:10.869 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA]
That's very true.

00:15:10.952 --> 00:15:12.787 position:50% align:center
I haven't made any mistakes.

00:15:12.871 --> 00:15:15.790 position:50% align:center
And yet I feel so empty inside.

00:15:15.874 --> 00:15:18.209 position:50% align:center
Before I knew it,
I became an old maid.

00:15:18.293 --> 00:15:21.046 position:50% align:center
One whose mountains of
money can't buy her happiness.

00:15:21.129 --> 00:15:23.673 position:50% align:center
Did my life have meaning
or was everything pointless?

00:15:23.757 --> 00:15:26.134 position:50% align:center
[CHIKA gasps]
It's a late-game Divorce square!

00:15:26.217 --> 00:15:28.053 position:50% align:center
I find out my spouse cheated!

00:15:28.136 --> 00:15:30.180 position:50% align:center
And now we're divorced!

00:15:30.263 --> 00:15:31.931 position:50% align:center
[YU]
Man, what a jerk.

00:15:32.015 --> 00:15:34.517 position:50% align:center
Stop acting like
this is real life!

00:15:34.601 --> 00:15:37.937 position:50% align:center
[YU] Real or not, the husband is
required to pay 20 million yen

00:15:38.021 --> 00:15:39.939 position:50% align:center
per kid for child support.

00:15:40.023 --> 00:15:42.108 position:50% align:center
You have got to be kidding!

00:15:42.192 --> 00:15:44.361 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA]
Oh, my.

00:15:44.444 --> 00:15:46.446 position:50% align:center
You really are quite cute.

00:15:46.529 --> 00:15:49.157 position:50% align:center
You should not be that happy
when someone else is suffering.

00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:52.369 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA giggles]
I guess it's my turn!

00:15:52.452 --> 00:15:54.579 position:50% align:center
What? A Marriage square?

00:15:54.662 --> 00:15:55.747 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA gasps]

00:15:55.830 --> 00:15:56.873 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA]
The player who's closest to me

00:15:56.956 --> 00:15:58.208 position:50% align:center
right now is the president!

00:15:58.291 --> 00:15:59.668 position:50% align:center
Then that means...

00:15:59.751 --> 00:16:00.543 position:50% align:center
Oh my God!

00:16:00.627 --> 00:16:01.378 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:16:01.461 --> 00:16:06.466 position:50% align:center
[bells tolling]

00:16:06.549 --> 00:16:08.468 position:50% align:center
[BOTH giggling]

00:16:08.551 --> 00:16:10.637 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA] The president
and I are actually...

00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:13.139 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI]
Shinomiya and I are really...

00:16:13.223 --> 00:16:14.849 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA, MIYUKI]
...married?!

00:16:16.351 --> 00:16:18.520 position:50% align:center
[YU]
Wait, there's a technicality!

00:16:18.603 --> 00:16:20.230 position:50% align:center
The vice president
is still in possession

00:16:20.313 --> 00:16:21.898 position:50% align:center
of a Distrusts All Men card.

00:16:21.981 --> 00:16:23.775 position:50% align:center
Therefore she
cannot get married!

00:16:23.858 --> 00:16:26.152 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA] What?!
Does anything else happen?

00:16:26.236 --> 00:16:29.364 position:50% align:center
[YU] Let's see. Looks like
it moves on to the next.

00:16:29.447 --> 00:16:31.533 position:50% align:center
You have no choice
but to marry Fujiwara!

00:16:31.616 --> 00:16:33.034 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA]
No!

00:16:33.118 --> 00:16:36.121 position:50% align:center
[bells tolling]

00:16:36.204 --> 00:16:39.499 position:50% align:center
[BOTH giggling]

00:16:39.582 --> 00:16:41.876 position:50% align:center
I can't wait to live happily
ever after with you,

00:16:41.960 --> 00:16:43.628 position:50% align:center
pookie bear!

00:16:43.712 --> 00:16:46.047 position:50% align:center
I landed on yet
another Birth square.

00:16:46.131 --> 00:16:48.425 position:50% align:center
We have our first child
together, sweetie!

00:16:48.508 --> 00:16:50.385 position:50% align:center
Wait, what?!

00:16:50.468 --> 00:16:53.096 position:50% align:center
What are the odds you'd
land on a Birth square, too?

00:16:53.179 --> 00:16:55.682 position:50% align:center
Old age ain't got nothin' on us!

00:16:55.765 --> 00:16:56.808 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR]
And then...

00:16:56.891 --> 00:16:58.768 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA]
I guess I won.

00:16:58.852 --> 00:17:01.479 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR]
Game over.

00:17:01.563 --> 00:17:03.064 position:50% align:center
[CHIKA]
And there ya have it!

00:17:03.148 --> 00:17:06.317 position:50% align:center
Kaguya dominates the Happy Life
Game by an incredible landslide!

00:17:06.401 --> 00:17:08.987 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA] I don't feel
like I dominated anything.

00:17:09.070 --> 00:17:10.238 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI] Adultery,
divorce, child support...

00:17:10.321 --> 00:17:12.157 position:50% align:center
[CHIKA] Didn't you guys
have an absolute blast?

00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:13.366 position:50% align:center
Let's play it again!

00:17:13.450 --> 00:17:14.534 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI]
That's not gonna happen.

00:17:14.617 --> 00:17:16.953 position:50% align:center
[CHIKA]
What?! But why not?

00:17:17.037 --> 00:17:19.456 position:50% align:center
[YU]
I actually kinda liked it.

00:17:19.539 --> 00:17:20.874 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR]
Today's Lesson:

00:17:20.957 --> 00:17:25.337 position:50% align:center
If you marry Fujiwara,
it will drive you to depression.

00:17:25.420 --> 00:17:27.213 position:50% align:center
You should really give
that game a total debugging

00:17:27.297 --> 00:17:28.673 position:50% align:center
before having more
people play it.

00:17:28.757 --> 00:17:30.592 position:50% align:center
Right now, the game
relies too much on luck.

00:17:30.675 --> 00:17:33.011 position:50% align:center
There isn't enough skill
involved to make it interesting.

00:17:33.094 --> 00:17:34.137 position:50% align:center
You could amp up strategy

00:17:34.220 --> 00:17:35.638 position:50% align:center
by letting players
pool one dice role.

00:17:35.722 --> 00:17:38.641 position:50% align:center
Speaking of die, that sudden
death element needs to go.

00:17:41.394 --> 00:17:44.814 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA] If I recall, you had
a birthday recently, didn't you?

00:17:44.898 --> 00:17:47.442 position:50% align:center
Oh. I guess you're
right about that.

00:17:47.525 --> 00:17:49.486 position:50% align:center
Did it somehow slip your mind?

00:17:49.569 --> 00:17:50.820 position:50% align:center
Just another day to me.

00:17:50.904 --> 00:17:53.198 position:50% align:center
It's been years since
I've celebrated it.

00:17:53.281 --> 00:17:54.949 position:50% align:center
Why do you ask?

00:17:55.033 --> 00:17:57.869 position:50% align:center
Are you tying to say you'll
celebrate with me next year?

00:17:57.952 --> 00:17:59.371 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA]
Hah, hah.

00:17:59.454 --> 00:18:02.165 position:50% align:center
There's not a snowball's chance
in hell of that happening.

00:18:04.125 --> 00:18:05.627 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:18:05.710 --> 00:18:08.254 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA] Only four more days
till the president's birthday.

00:18:08.338 --> 00:18:09.756 position:50% align:center
But after what
I told him last year,

00:18:09.839 --> 00:18:12.592 position:50% align:center
I have no idea how
to bring it up!

00:18:12.676 --> 00:18:14.094 position:50% align:center
Argh, get a grip, girl!

00:18:14.177 --> 00:18:15.387 position:50% align:center
Look at this!

00:18:15.470 --> 00:18:16.846 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA] Why can't I
seem to think of anything

00:18:16.930 --> 00:18:19.516 position:50% align:center
besides what I should do to
celebrate his stupid day?!

00:18:19.599 --> 00:18:21.393 position:50% align:center
I mean, it's not like I have
to do something for him.

00:18:21.476 --> 00:18:22.560 position:50% align:center
I made a diamond!

00:18:22.644 --> 00:18:23.728 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA grunting]

00:18:23.812 --> 00:18:25.188 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR]
Birthdays!

00:18:25.271 --> 00:18:27.732 position:50% align:center
A special occasion that only
comes around once a year.

00:18:27.816 --> 00:18:30.235 position:50% align:center
But that specialness is
lost on people like Shirogane

00:18:30.318 --> 00:18:32.862 position:50% align:center
who lack the finances to
throw parties and whatnot.

00:18:32.946 --> 00:18:35.198 position:50% align:center
Birthdays have become
irrelevant in his eyes.

00:18:35.281 --> 00:18:36.408 position:50% align:center
And unless someone mentions it,

00:18:36.491 --> 00:18:37.826 position:50% align:center
the annual
celebration of his birth

00:18:37.909 --> 00:18:39.619 position:50% align:center
will go by unnoticed once again.

00:18:39.703 --> 00:18:40.745 position:50% align:center
[CHIKA]
Hm?

00:18:40.829 --> 00:18:41.996 position:50% align:center
--[KAGUYA stammering]
--[CHIKA] Uhh...

00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:44.374 position:50% align:center
I can't help but feel
like something's wrong.

00:18:44.457 --> 00:18:45.625 position:50% align:center
Well...

00:18:45.709 --> 00:18:47.752 position:50% align:center
Your instincts are right
on the money this time.

00:18:47.836 --> 00:18:51.172 position:50% align:center
[CHIKA]
Mm-hm, mm-hm. Aha!

00:18:51.256 --> 00:18:54.009 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA sighs, gasps]

00:18:54.092 --> 00:18:56.302 position:50% align:center
Can't worry about the future
if Fortuneteller Chika

00:18:56.386 --> 00:18:58.638 position:50% align:center
tells you what it is!

00:18:58.722 --> 00:19:00.432 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah?

00:19:00.515 --> 00:19:01.850 position:50% align:center
[CHIKA]
Yeah!

00:19:01.933 --> 00:19:03.435 position:50% align:center
Just plug your gender and
birthdate into this site,

00:19:03.518 --> 00:19:06.980 position:50% align:center
and your problems will melt away
like gumdrops under the sun!

00:19:07.063 --> 00:19:08.314 position:50% align:center
Guaranteed!

00:19:08.398 --> 00:19:10.233 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA] Which means
the app's the fortuneteller.

00:19:10.316 --> 00:19:14.070 position:50% align:center
I dunno. What can a gender
and a birthdate tell someone?

00:19:14.154 --> 00:19:16.156 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA]
Birthdate?!

00:19:16.239 --> 00:19:17.907 position:50% align:center
It seems interesting, though.

00:19:17.991 --> 00:19:19.826 position:50% align:center
Why don't we all give it a try?

00:19:19.909 --> 00:19:21.161 position:50% align:center
[CHIKA]
Okay!

00:19:21.244 --> 00:19:23.747 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA] My birthday falls
on the first of January.

00:19:23.830 --> 00:19:25.623 position:50% align:center
Double celebrations.

00:19:25.707 --> 00:19:26.750 position:50% align:center
[CHIKA]
Mm-hmm! Mm-hmm!

00:19:26.833 --> 00:19:30.295 position:50% align:center
Born on the very
first day of January!

00:19:30.378 --> 00:19:31.880 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA] "You have an
unmistakable likeness

00:19:31.963 --> 00:19:33.423 position:50% align:center
to an Alexandrite.

00:19:33.506 --> 00:19:35.633 position:50% align:center
Like the beautiful gem
named after a king,

00:19:35.717 --> 00:19:38.887 position:50% align:center
you have a noble character
as well as a prideful heart.

00:19:38.970 --> 00:19:41.514 position:50% align:center
Moreover, just as this stone
possesses the rare trait

00:19:41.598 --> 00:19:44.059 position:50% align:center
of sometimes appearing
red and other times blue,

00:19:44.142 --> 00:19:46.394 position:50% align:center
you sometimes take on
the guise of an angel,

00:19:46.478 --> 00:19:48.897 position:50% align:center
but at other times, a demon."

00:19:48.980 --> 00:19:51.358 position:50% align:center
If you abandon your pride
and confront your feelings,

00:19:51.441 --> 00:19:53.318 position:50% align:center
--[YU] When she's full of pride,
--happiness will come to you."

00:19:53.401 --> 00:19:54.819 position:50% align:center
[YU]
she's a...

00:19:56.863 --> 00:19:58.365 position:50% align:center
...demon!

00:20:00.492 --> 00:20:01.659 position:50% align:center
What was that?

00:20:01.743 --> 00:20:02.994 position:50% align:center
Nothing!

00:20:03.078 --> 00:20:05.663 position:50% align:center
[sighs] That wasn't the
slightest bit accurate.

00:20:05.747 --> 00:20:06.790 position:50% align:center
[YU whimpers]

00:20:06.873 --> 00:20:08.208 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA]
I believe your birthday is...

00:20:08.291 --> 00:20:10.585 position:50% align:center
March third,
the same as Girls' Day!

00:20:10.669 --> 00:20:13.505 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA] "You are comparable to
the bright flame of a candle.

00:20:13.588 --> 00:20:14.923 position:50% align:center
You light up your surroundings

00:20:15.006 --> 00:20:18.635 position:50% align:center
and although it happens
slowly, you can also melt ice.

00:20:18.718 --> 00:20:21.304 position:50% align:center
That symbolizes
dedication and affection.

00:20:21.388 --> 00:20:23.139 position:50% align:center
A powerful combination.

00:20:23.223 --> 00:20:24.641 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA, CHIKA] If you
continue to pour love into

00:20:24.724 --> 00:20:28.061 position:50% align:center
everything you do,
your wish will come true."

00:20:28.144 --> 00:20:29.396 position:50% align:center
How cool!

00:20:29.479 --> 00:20:31.481 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA] I'm not sure how,
but it confused "greedy"

00:20:31.564 --> 00:20:35.026 position:50% align:center
and "narcissistic" with
"dedicated" and "affectionate."

00:20:35.110 --> 00:20:36.820 position:50% align:center
March third is my birthday, too.

00:20:36.903 --> 00:20:39.447 position:50% align:center
Why would you do something like
that to me, you thunder-stealer?

00:20:39.531 --> 00:20:40.907 position:50% align:center
[YU] Well, why are
you angry about it?

00:20:40.990 --> 00:20:43.243 position:50% align:center
Instead of having a special
day when we celebrate me,

00:20:43.326 --> 00:20:44.911 position:50% align:center
I'll have to share it with you!

00:20:44.994 --> 00:20:46.621 position:50% align:center
And you'll suck up
all the specialness

00:20:46.705 --> 00:20:49.833 position:50% align:center
that day's supposed to bring
just by being born! Idiot!

00:20:49.916 --> 00:20:52.002 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA] People are only
interested in reading horoscopes

00:20:52.085 --> 00:20:54.546 position:50% align:center
because the way they're written
is open to interpretation.

00:20:54.629 --> 00:20:55.964 position:50% align:center
The Barnum effect at its finest.

00:20:56.047 --> 00:20:57.382 position:50% align:center
[CHIKA growls]

00:20:57.465 --> 00:20:59.718 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA] But they can still
be useful in other ways.

00:20:59.801 --> 00:21:01.803 position:50% align:center
And, last but not least...

00:21:01.886 --> 00:21:02.721 position:50% align:center
...tell me your birthday and I--

00:21:02.804 --> 00:21:03.888 position:50% align:center
Not interested.

00:21:03.972 --> 00:21:04.806 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA gasps]

00:21:04.889 --> 00:21:06.266 position:50% align:center
It's the Barnum effect.

00:21:06.349 --> 00:21:08.143 position:50% align:center
People are interested
in reading horoscopes

00:21:08.226 --> 00:21:10.729 position:50% align:center
because the way they're written
is open to interpretation.

00:21:10.812 --> 00:21:12.022 position:50% align:center
Uhh...

00:21:12.105 --> 00:21:12.981 position:50% align:center
Really?

00:21:13.064 --> 00:21:14.566 position:50% align:center
Well, I don't think that's true.

00:21:14.649 --> 00:21:16.067 position:50% align:center
Feng shui, for instance.

00:21:16.151 --> 00:21:18.820 position:50% align:center
It has elements of both
architecture and statistics.

00:21:18.903 --> 00:21:21.281 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI] But this is a
birthday horoscope, right?

00:21:21.364 --> 00:21:24.284 position:50% align:center
Just some random day of the year
you happened to be born on.

00:21:24.367 --> 00:21:25.785 position:50% align:center
What's so special about that?

00:21:25.869 --> 00:21:29.289 position:50% align:center
Well, it's special to
the person born on that day!

00:21:29.372 --> 00:21:31.458 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI] I once divulged
to you and only you

00:21:31.541 --> 00:21:34.252 position:50% align:center
when my birthday was, Shinomiya.

00:21:34.336 --> 00:21:35.462 position:50% align:center
You have a great memory,

00:21:35.545 --> 00:21:37.630 position:50% align:center
yet even you forgot
something so trivial.

00:21:37.714 --> 00:21:39.132 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA]
I didn't forget!

00:21:39.215 --> 00:21:40.717 position:50% align:center
Your birthday's September
ninth, which makes you a Virgo!

00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:44.554 position:50% align:center
Your blood type is O and your
birth weight was 2,118 grams!

00:21:44.637 --> 00:21:45.764 position:50% align:center
I remember everything!

00:21:45.847 --> 00:21:47.223 position:50% align:center
[CHIKA]
Don't be like that!

00:21:47.307 --> 00:21:49.184 position:50% align:center
Aside from personality analysis,

00:21:49.267 --> 00:21:51.644 position:50% align:center
this also does
compatibility divination!

00:21:51.728 --> 00:21:53.188 position:50% align:center
I say we give it a shot!

00:21:53.271 --> 00:21:55.482 position:50% align:center
I won't do it! Any of it!

00:21:55.565 --> 00:21:58.276 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA] Jeez! Why are
you so anti-birthdays?

00:21:58.360 --> 00:21:59.986 position:50% align:center
I'm just trying to get
people to celebrate with you,

00:22:00.070 --> 00:22:02.739 position:50% align:center
so the least you can do is
some stinking horoscope test!

00:22:02.822 --> 00:22:04.491 position:50% align:center
I don't even know why
I care since you probably

00:22:04.574 --> 00:22:07.035 position:50% align:center
have no intention of
celebrating my birthday!

00:22:07.118 --> 00:22:09.788 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR] That's not true.
Shirogane eagerly watches

00:22:09.871 --> 00:22:12.290 position:50% align:center
the daily horoscope
on TV every morning.

00:22:12.374 --> 00:22:13.583 position:50% align:center
And he has Kaguya's birthday

00:22:13.667 --> 00:22:15.627 position:50% align:center
very clearly marked
in his date book.

00:22:15.710 --> 00:22:17.128 position:50% align:center
The real reason
for his reluctance

00:22:17.212 --> 00:22:18.963 position:50% align:center
is because he's
already used that app.

00:22:19.047 --> 00:22:20.423 position:50% align:center
He knows what both the analysis

00:22:20.507 --> 00:22:22.967 position:50% align:center
and the compatibility
divination say.

00:22:25.011 --> 00:22:27.889 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI]
Oh, man. Why did I look?

00:22:27.972 --> 00:22:30.141 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR] Shirogane refuses
to tell Shinomiya his birthday

00:22:30.225 --> 00:22:31.267 position:50% align:center
because he doesn't
want her to see

00:22:31.351 --> 00:22:33.520 position:50% align:center
how incompatible
their horoscopes are.

00:22:33.603 --> 00:22:37.440 position:50% align:center
But... he can't exactly
explain that to her.

00:22:38.733 --> 00:22:41.111 position:50% align:center
There's no way
I can tell her that.

00:22:42.362 --> 00:22:43.697 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA] Is he trying
to tell me something

00:22:43.780 --> 00:22:46.616 position:50% align:center
by saying he can't
tell me something?

00:22:46.700 --> 00:22:48.660 position:50% align:center
Hmm. I wonder.

00:22:48.743 --> 00:22:50.829 position:50% align:center
[YU yelps]

00:22:50.912 --> 00:22:53.957 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA] Could it be that
the president only wants me

00:22:54.040 --> 00:22:55.750 position:50% align:center
to celebrate his
birthday with him?

00:22:55.834 --> 00:22:57.502 position:50% align:center
--[buzzer sounds]
--[NARRATOR] No.

00:22:57.585 --> 00:22:58.795 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA]
Or maybe he's in a bad mood

00:22:58.878 --> 00:23:00.630 position:50% align:center
because he thinks I've
forgotten all about it

00:23:00.714 --> 00:23:02.632 position:50% align:center
and doesn't know how to express
his emotions!

00:23:02.716 --> 00:23:03.633 position:50% align:center
--[buzzer sounds]
--[NARRATOR] Wrong.

00:23:03.717 --> 00:23:05.051 position:50% align:center
Come on!

00:23:05.135 --> 00:23:06.761 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA] If that's what it is,
then I have no choice.

00:23:06.845 --> 00:23:08.555 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR]
That's not what it is though.

00:23:08.638 --> 00:23:10.390 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA] Just the two of us
celebrating his birthday

00:23:10.473 --> 00:23:12.642 position:50% align:center
would be something
a couple would do!

00:23:12.726 --> 00:23:13.768 position:50% align:center
--[MIYUKI groans]
--[KAGUYA] Well,

00:23:13.852 --> 00:23:14.894 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA]
if I'm gonna give in,

00:23:14.978 --> 00:23:17.355 position:50% align:center
then it might as
well be on his birthday!

00:23:17.439 --> 00:23:19.816 position:50% align:center
You, uh, feeling okay?

00:23:19.899 --> 00:23:23.862 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA giggles]
I'm perfectly peachy.

00:23:23.945 --> 00:23:25.113 position:50% align:center
[YU]
Who is this angel?!

00:23:25.196 --> 00:23:26.781 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA]
I appreciate your concern.

00:23:26.865 --> 00:23:28.908 position:50% align:center
But if you're ever in trouble,
no matter what it is,

00:23:28.992 --> 00:23:30.452 position:50% align:center
please don't hesitate
to ask me for advice!

00:23:30.535 --> 00:23:32.370 position:50% align:center
[YU]
I'm gonna be sick!

00:23:32.454 --> 00:23:34.122 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR]
Kaguya wants to throw Shirogane

00:23:34.205 --> 00:23:35.957 position:50% align:center
an extra special
birthday party--

00:23:36.041 --> 00:23:39.044 position:50% align:center
one for just the two of them!

00:23:39.127 --> 00:23:41.671 position:50% align:center
Guess no one cares
about my fortune, huh?
