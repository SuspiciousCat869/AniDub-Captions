What are you people

[KAGUYA] Highlighting
what you've achieved

would be a good start,

you're very likeable.

Okay, did not see that coming.

00:05:22.947 --> 00:05:25.825 position:50% align:center

Of course. I got the
vibe that you might.

00:06:10.203 --> 00:06:12.330 position:50% align:center
Oh, and it's about
a friend, not me.

00:06:12.414 --> 00:06:13.790 position:50% align:center
[NAGISA]
It's totally about Kaguya.

00:06:13.873 --> 00:06:16.626 position:50% align:center
So, this friend, she has
a boy she's interested in,

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:18.586 position:50% align:center
but he's gone through
some drastic changes.

00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:20.714 position:50% align:center
[NAGISA] And that
boy would be Shirogane.

00:06:20.797 --> 00:06:23.299 position:50% align:center

[NAGISA]
Huh?

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:28.763 position:50% align:center
The thing that changed
about him was physical,

00:06:28.847 --> 00:06:31.641 position:50% align:center
so she thinks her
feelings are only skin deep--

00:06:31.725 --> 00:06:33.268 position:50% align:center
that it's not true love.

00:06:33.351 --> 00:06:34.686 position:50% align:center
Ah, I see.

00:06:34.769 --> 00:06:37.188 position:50% align:center

True love!

00:06:39.441 --> 00:06:42.027 position:50% align:center
Ugh. I feel embarrassed
just saying it!

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:44.362 position:50% align:center
For most people, such an
expression hardly ever comes up.

00:06:44.446 --> 00:06:47.032 position:50% align:center
But Kaguya was born and raised
in a special environment,

00:06:47.115 --> 00:06:48.867 position:50% align:center
making her an exception.

00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:50.493 position:50% align:center
She's sheltered, yes,

00:06:50.577 --> 00:06:52.328 position:50% align:center

know how cringey

I'm the person Kaguya
turned to for help,

00:07:10.597 --> 00:07:12.640 position:50% align:center
so I'll give it my best shot!

00:07:12.724 --> 00:07:15.060 position:50% align:center
Love is a constant
roller coaster.

00:07:15.143 --> 00:07:17.979 position:50% align:center

[KAGUYA]
Yeah, but

00:07:19.439 --> 00:07:21.316 position:50% align:center

It sounds to me like
your friend's feelings

00:07:31.201 --> 00:07:32.827 position:50% align:center
are the real deal so...

00:07:32.911 --> 00:07:35.038 position:50% align:center
...could be true

There, I said it.

Really? You think
it still may be love?

Yes, and not just
any love--true love!

00:07:46.341 --> 00:07:47.801 position:50% align:center

I still wanna know what it is.

[CHIKA] It's really
not that complicated!

00:08:24.671 --> 00:08:27.382 position:50% align:center
A perfect example of true love

00:09:00.915 --> 00:09:03.043 position:50% align:center

True love, huh?

00:09:04.836 --> 00:09:06.838 position:50% align:center

00:09:18.933 --> 00:09:21.978 position:50% align:center
[YU] But having realistic
expectations in your heart

00:09:22.062 --> 00:09:24.105 position:50% align:center
and finding somebody
who meets them,

00:09:24.189 --> 00:09:26.149 position:50% align:center
that's what I
consider true love.

00:09:26.232 --> 00:09:28.318 position:50% align:center

00:09:36.951 --> 00:09:38.953 position:50% align:center
There isn't a right

00:09:39.037 --> 00:09:41.289 position:50% align:center

your love's realistic.

00:21:46.681 --> 00:21:48.224 position:50% align:center
You said, "generous offer."

00:21:48.308 --> 00:21:51.603 position:50% align:center
So what are the
conditions going to be?

00:21:51.686 --> 00:21:53.313 position:50% align:center
I don't consider it a condition,

00:21:53.396 --> 00:21:56.316 position:50% align:center
but you should wait
until you're a second-year.

00:21:56.399 --> 00:21:57.901 position:50% align:center
And honestly,
you'd be better off

00:21:57.984 --> 00:22:00.320 position:50% align:center
learning a little more
about the high school first.

00:22:00.403 --> 00:22:01.571 position:50% align:center
I mean, how can you expect us

00:22:01.654 --> 00:22:04.449 position:50% align:center
to have confidence
in you otherwise?

00:22:04.532 --> 00:22:07.869 position:50% align:center
So then, in exchange
for your help next year,

00:22:07.952 --> 00:22:10.663 position:50% align:center
you want me and my team
to drop out this year.

00:22:10.747 --> 00:22:13.124 position:50% align:center
Is that what it boils down to?

00:22:13.208 --> 00:22:15.794 position:50% align:center
Oh, my. Do you think
that's for the best?

00:22:15.877 --> 00:22:17.212 position:50% align:center
[MIKO]
I see.

00:22:17.295 --> 00:22:18.755 position:50% align:center
Election aside,

00:22:18.838 --> 00:22:22.050 position:50% align:center
are those the methods the
former Student Council used?

00:22:22.133 --> 00:22:24.386 position:50% align:center
It's plain dirty.

00:22:24.469 --> 00:22:26.971 position:50% align:center
Both you and
Ex-President Shirogane

00:22:27.055 --> 00:22:29.099 position:50% align:center
are a real match made in heaven!

00:22:29.182 --> 00:22:31.184 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Seriously?

00:22:31.267 --> 00:22:33.687 position:50% align:center
That's right, you are
100 percent compatible!

00:22:33.770 --> 00:22:34.896 position:50% align:center
A perfect pair!

00:22:34.979 --> 00:22:36.731 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA]
Um, so...

00:22:36.815 --> 00:22:38.441 position:50% align:center
You're not just saying that?

00:22:38.525 --> 00:22:40.235 position:50% align:center
You really think
we're compatible?

00:22:40.318 --> 00:22:41.444 position:50% align:center
[MIKO]
Are you kidding?!

00:22:41.528 --> 00:22:43.154 position:50% align:center
You couldn't be more
attuned if you tried!

00:22:43.238 --> 00:22:45.240 position:50% align:center
I mean, you might as
well get married already!

00:22:45.323 --> 00:22:47.742 position:50% align:center
Ahh! But it's way
too soon for that!

00:22:47.826 --> 00:22:48.993 position:50% align:center
I can't believe the two of you

00:22:49.077 --> 00:22:50.578 position:50% align:center
have had the run of
this whole place.

00:22:50.662 --> 00:22:54.290 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA] Wow! Who would've
thought she'd be so nice?

00:22:54.374 --> 00:22:56.501 position:50% align:center
Get a grip! Don't be
swayed by emotions!

00:22:56.584 --> 00:22:58.753 position:50% align:center
I'm one step away
from breaking her spirit.

00:22:58.837 --> 00:23:00.046 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA]
I just remembered.

00:23:00.130 --> 00:23:01.589 position:50% align:center
Ah, ha! Oh, yes!

00:23:01.673 --> 00:23:03.174 position:50% align:center
We do have emergency fruitcake!

00:23:03.258 --> 00:23:04.384 position:50% align:center
[MIKO]
Save it!

00:23:04.467 --> 00:23:05.468 position:50% align:center
Oh...

00:23:05.552 --> 00:23:06.761 position:50% align:center
[MIKO]
I've made up my mind.

00:23:06.845 --> 00:23:08.138 position:50% align:center
You and the former president

00:23:08.221 --> 00:23:10.098 position:50% align:center
are going to be part
of my student council.

00:23:10.181 --> 00:23:11.224 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA]
Huh?!

00:23:11.307 --> 00:23:12.642 position:50% align:center
Your days of playing
dirty are numbered

00:23:12.726 --> 00:23:15.020 position:50% align:center
because I'm going to
straighten you out myself!

00:23:15.103 --> 00:23:19.190 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA]
No! You can't!

00:23:19.274 --> 00:23:20.233 position:50% align:center
Wait.

00:23:20.316 --> 00:23:22.360 position:50% align:center
Iino might be
onto something here.

00:23:22.444 --> 00:23:24.612 position:50% align:center
If the president and I
were on her council,

00:23:24.696 --> 00:23:27.240 position:50% align:center
we'd get to see each other
every day, guaranteed.

00:23:27.323 --> 00:23:29.284 position:50% align:center
And because he wouldn't
actually be president,

00:23:29.367 --> 00:23:30.410 position:50% align:center
he'd have less work.

00:23:30.493 --> 00:23:31.369 position:50% align:center
[MIKO]
So.

00:23:31.453 --> 00:23:32.579 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA grunts]

00:23:32.662 --> 00:23:34.205 position:50% align:center
[MIKO] We'll join forces
and bring order back

00:23:34.289 --> 00:23:35.790 position:50% align:center
to the halls of this school!

00:23:35.874 --> 00:23:38.335 position:50% align:center
There will be a uniform
check every morning!

00:23:38.418 --> 00:23:40.503 position:50% align:center
And trash duty after school!

00:23:40.587 --> 00:23:43.089 position:50% align:center
And no touching or getting
frisky off campus either!

00:23:43.173 --> 00:23:44.758 position:50% align:center
So, no romance?

00:23:44.841 --> 00:23:46.217 position:50% align:center
Of course not!

00:23:46.301 --> 00:23:48.345 position:50% align:center
They have to be at least 50
centimeters apart, always!

00:23:48.428 --> 00:23:51.097 position:50% align:center
With Vice President
Fujiwara at my side,

00:23:51.181 --> 00:23:52.390 position:50% align:center
we'll make it possible!

00:23:52.474 --> 00:23:53.224 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA]
What?!

00:23:53.308 --> 00:23:55.894 position:50% align:center
Uh, Vice President Fujiwara?

00:23:55.977 --> 00:23:57.103 position:50% align:center
Ya sure?

00:23:57.187 --> 00:23:58.480 position:50% align:center
I can't wait.

00:23:58.563 --> 00:23:59.939 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA grunts]

00:24:00.023 --> 00:24:01.941 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA] What's this girl
talking about? She's insane!

00:24:02.025 --> 00:24:05.195 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR] Results for, uh...
Was this really a battle?

00:24:05.278 --> 00:24:08.531 position:50% align:center
Either way,
next time's Election Day!
