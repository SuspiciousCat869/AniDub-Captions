[KAGUYA sighs]

00:00:23.273 --> 00:00:26.026 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA] I got my first
flip phone when I was five.

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:27.569 position:50% align:center
But the only thing
I ever used it for

00:00:27.652 --> 00:00:29.821 position:50% align:center
was making emergency calls.

00:00:30.989 --> 00:00:34.451 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA] That is, until
I joined the student council.

00:00:34.534 --> 00:00:37.871 position:50% align:center
Now it helps me
document my daily life.

00:00:37.954 --> 00:00:39.706 position:50% align:center
I used to look down
on girls my age

00:00:39.789 --> 00:00:41.750 position:50% align:center
who were constantly
on their phones.

00:00:41.833 --> 00:00:45.962 position:50% align:center
Taking pictures of
anything and everything.

00:00:46.046 --> 00:00:47.630 position:50% align:center
I couldn't relate.

00:00:47.714 --> 00:00:50.050 position:50% align:center
There was nothing
I wanted a photo of.

00:00:50.133 --> 00:00:52.344 position:50% align:center
No days I wanted
to look back on.

00:00:52.427 --> 00:00:53.845 position:50% align:center
Hand it over this instant!

00:00:53.928 --> 00:00:55.680 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA] At least, that's
how I felt at the time.

00:00:55.764 --> 00:00:57.557 position:50% align:center
[MIKO]
Ishigami!

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:59.601 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA]
Nowadays...

00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:02.812 position:50% align:center
[CHIKA grunts]

00:01:02.896 --> 00:01:04.397 position:50% align:center
[MIKO, YU gasping]

00:01:04.481 --> 00:01:06.441 position:50% align:center
Let's get a group shot!

00:01:07.567 --> 00:01:09.319 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA]
...I'm of a different mind.

00:01:09.402 --> 00:01:14.282 position:50% align:center
It may seem simple...
but doing something like this

00:01:14.366 --> 00:01:17.702 position:50% align:center
makes me feel
like a normal girl.

00:01:17.786 --> 00:01:19.788 position:50% align:center
[MIKO]
Um, you want pictures of us?

00:01:19.871 --> 00:01:22.665 position:50% align:center
<i>Oui!</i> We are making
a pamphlet for the academy!

00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:25.460 position:50% align:center
I was hoping you'd be willing
to do some modeling for it.

00:01:25.543 --> 00:01:27.337 position:50% align:center
We get to be actual models?

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.172 position:50% align:center
Wow, how fun!
What should I wear?

00:01:29.255 --> 00:01:31.049 position:50% align:center
[ADOLPHE]
Your uniform, of course.

00:01:31.132 --> 00:01:32.258 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA]
I'm sorry.

00:01:32.342 --> 00:01:35.053 position:50% align:center
I hate to be the
bearer of bad news.

00:01:35.136 --> 00:01:36.805 position:50% align:center
But my family
has a strict policy

00:01:36.888 --> 00:01:38.431 position:50% align:center
that doesn't allow
my face to appear

00:01:38.515 --> 00:01:39.808 position:50% align:center
in any unapproved media.

00:01:39.891 --> 00:01:41.434 position:50% align:center
Oh! Surely, they'll
make an exception

00:01:41.518 --> 00:01:42.769 position:50% align:center
if it's school related!

00:01:42.852 --> 00:01:45.105 position:50% align:center
Or maybe try posing like this.

00:01:45.188 --> 00:01:46.856 position:50% align:center
I thought this was for school!

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:49.150 position:50% align:center
It's no big deal,
just do it without me.

00:01:49.234 --> 00:01:50.985 position:50% align:center
I've never been
photogenic anyway,

00:01:51.069 --> 00:01:52.821 position:50% align:center
so it's probably for the best.

00:01:52.904 --> 00:01:55.490 position:50% align:center
[ADOLPHE]
It's such a shame.

00:01:55.573 --> 00:01:59.119 position:50% align:center
I can still create a dazzling
pamphlet! [clears throat]

00:01:59.202 --> 00:02:00.537 position:50% align:center
Something that'll make kids want

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:02.914 position:50% align:center
to spend the springtime of
their lives at our school!

00:02:02.997 --> 00:02:04.916 position:50% align:center
So, please, hold nothing back

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.419 position:50% align:center
and show me that
blossoming adolescence!

00:02:07.502 --> 00:02:09.462 position:50% align:center
What's with the flower analogy?

00:02:09.546 --> 00:02:12.424 position:50% align:center
[ADOLPHE chuckles]
At least give it a try.

00:02:12.507 --> 00:02:14.426 position:50% align:center
[CHIKA]
Um, you mean like this?

00:02:14.509 --> 00:02:18.513 position:50% align:center
[YU] Apparently Fujiwara
blossomed into a bratty toddler.

00:02:18.596 --> 00:02:19.681 position:50% align:center
Uh...

00:02:19.764 --> 00:02:20.932 position:50% align:center
Aw. First photo shoot?

00:02:21.016 --> 00:02:22.183 position:50% align:center
Cheese?

00:02:22.267 --> 00:02:23.560 position:50% align:center
[ADOLPHE]
Thank you, next!

00:02:23.643 --> 00:02:24.728 position:50% align:center
[MIKO grunts]

00:02:24.811 --> 00:02:27.147 position:50% align:center
Come now, why are
you hiding your face?

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:28.940 position:50% align:center
Because it's
embarrassing for me.

00:02:29.024 --> 00:02:32.485 position:50% align:center
<i>Sacré bleu!</i> To hide
a face as lovely as yours

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:35.363 position:50% align:center
from a camera is
simply a travesty!

00:02:35.447 --> 00:02:36.656 position:50% align:center
You think so?

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:39.534 position:50% align:center
I know so! Don't you
own a mirror, dear girl?!

00:02:39.617 --> 00:02:41.244 position:50% align:center
[ADOLPHE growls]

00:02:41.327 --> 00:02:43.288 position:50% align:center
[ADOLPHE]
So put that clipboard down

00:02:43.371 --> 00:02:46.124 position:50% align:center
and embrace how cute you are.

00:02:47.917 --> 00:02:51.296 position:50% align:center
[ADOLPHE] Yes! I can't
handle you right now!

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:53.298 position:50% align:center
--[camera shutter clicking]
--[MIKO grunts]

00:02:53.381 --> 00:02:55.216 position:50% align:center
[ADOLPHE]
Don't be afraid, darling.

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:57.552 position:50% align:center
Entrust your body to me.

00:02:57.635 --> 00:03:01.681 position:50% align:center
Yes. Now bite your pen.

00:03:01.765 --> 00:03:04.392 position:50% align:center
Come on.

00:03:04.476 --> 00:03:07.228 position:50% align:center
If a sleazy guy ever tries
to scout you as a model,

00:03:07.312 --> 00:03:08.772 position:50% align:center
run away, Iino.

00:03:08.855 --> 00:03:12.025 position:50% align:center
[ADOLPHE] Hmm. Say, could you
stand next to her, Ishigami?

00:03:12.108 --> 00:03:14.527 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Really?

00:03:14.611 --> 00:03:17.155 position:50% align:center
[ADOLPHE]
No, no, no!

00:03:17.238 --> 00:03:19.574 position:50% align:center
--Something is off here.
--[MIKO, YU] Mutter, mutter...

00:03:19.657 --> 00:03:21.159 position:50% align:center
Shinomiya, dear,

00:03:21.242 --> 00:03:23.912 position:50% align:center
would you mind giving Ishigami
a more fashionable hairstyle?

00:03:23.995 --> 00:03:25.121 position:50% align:center
Uh, sure.

00:03:25.205 --> 00:03:27.540 position:50% align:center
And you're looking much
too stiff there, Iino.

00:03:27.624 --> 00:03:29.459 position:50% align:center
Take a breath and loosen up.

00:03:29.542 --> 00:03:30.585 position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:03:30.669 --> 00:03:33.546 position:50% align:center
[YU] Mutter, mutter,
mutter, mutter...

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:38.968 position:50% align:center
[ADOLPHE]
Hah, hah! Yes! That's it!

00:03:39.052 --> 00:03:40.762 position:50% align:center
You two give off
the vibe of students

00:03:40.845 --> 00:03:42.138 position:50% align:center
who secretly help each other out

00:03:42.222 --> 00:03:44.557 position:50% align:center
but would sooner die
than admit it to anyone!

00:03:44.641 --> 00:03:46.601 position:50% align:center
Eh. Seriously?

00:03:46.685 --> 00:03:48.144 position:50% align:center
That's really random.

00:03:48.228 --> 00:03:50.689 position:50% align:center
[ADOLPHE] I need more shots
of the president and Fujiwara!

00:03:50.772 --> 00:03:52.357 position:50% align:center
Let's go!

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:53.608 position:50% align:center
[BOTH chuckle]

00:03:53.692 --> 00:03:56.653 position:50% align:center
[ADOLPHE]
<i>Pas bon.</i> Act more natural!

00:03:56.736 --> 00:03:58.655 position:50% align:center
I thought I was.

00:03:58.738 --> 00:04:00.156 position:50% align:center
[ADOLPHE]
Hmm, let's see.

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:02.283 position:50% align:center
Perhaps giving you
a hypothetical situation

00:04:02.367 --> 00:04:03.827 position:50% align:center
would make it easier.

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:05.745 position:50% align:center
Hmm.

00:04:05.829 --> 00:04:08.039 position:50% align:center
Pretend like the two of you
are dating each other.

00:04:08.123 --> 00:04:10.291 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA shrieks]

00:04:15.922 --> 00:04:19.092 position:50% align:center
[ADOLPHE] You're having a
conversation in the hallway,

00:04:19.175 --> 00:04:22.345 position:50% align:center
when your hands brush--
an innocent accident.

00:04:22.429 --> 00:04:25.682 position:50% align:center
So pure and perfect!
It's pure-fect!

00:04:25.765 --> 00:04:29.394 position:50% align:center
I can see the budding romance!
The springtime of youth!

00:04:29.477 --> 00:04:31.229 position:50% align:center
<i>Très-très-très bien!</i>

00:04:31.312 --> 00:04:34.607 position:50% align:center
Now bring your
faces closer together!

00:04:34.691 --> 00:04:37.444 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA] Honestly. I always
thought of this man as a clown

00:04:37.527 --> 00:04:39.654 position:50% align:center
exiled from his own circus.

00:04:39.738 --> 00:04:42.449 position:50% align:center
But I never realized
the depths of his stupidity.

00:04:42.532 --> 00:04:43.908 position:50% align:center
It's almost like he has no idea

00:04:43.992 --> 00:04:46.786 position:50% align:center
how much my family
donates to this school.

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:48.121 position:50% align:center
The one thing
I hope he does know

00:04:48.204 --> 00:04:51.541 position:50% align:center
is that his days as
principal are numbered.

00:04:51.624 --> 00:04:53.501 position:50% align:center
It truly is such a pity.

00:04:53.585 --> 00:04:56.421 position:50% align:center
If only Shinomiya's family
didn't have that rule.

00:04:56.504 --> 00:04:59.174 position:50% align:center
She would've been ideal to play
the president's girlfriend.

00:04:59.257 --> 00:05:00.508 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA gasps]

00:05:00.592 --> 00:05:02.135 position:50% align:center
[ADOLPHE] Getting a shot
of them posing as a couple

00:05:02.218 --> 00:05:04.137 position:50% align:center
would've been the
crème de la crème!

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:05.638 position:50% align:center
They have the
kind of relationship

00:05:05.722 --> 00:05:07.515 position:50% align:center
every teenager strives for!

00:05:07.599 --> 00:05:10.352 position:50% align:center
That's the vision I had
for this pamphlet!

00:05:10.435 --> 00:05:13.897 position:50% align:center
Surely you can
understand my frustration!

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:17.984 position:50% align:center
Yes, yes, yes!
I understand you perfectly!

00:05:21.196 --> 00:05:22.906 position:50% align:center
I think a group shot
with the schoolyard

00:05:22.989 --> 00:05:25.408 position:50% align:center
in the background
would turn out quite nicely.

00:05:25.492 --> 00:05:27.619 position:50% align:center
Stand against the
railing, if you will.

00:05:27.702 --> 00:05:30.455 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA]
A group photo.

00:05:30.538 --> 00:05:31.623 position:50% align:center
Come to think of it,

00:05:31.706 --> 00:05:33.750 position:50% align:center
I've never taken
a picture like that before

00:05:33.833 --> 00:05:35.710 position:50% align:center
where everyone was in it.

00:05:37.087 --> 00:05:38.672 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA]
I'm jealous.

[ADOLPHE]
Shinomiya.

00:05:52.602 --> 00:05:53.978 position:50% align:center
You should be in this one, too.

00:05:54.062 --> 00:05:56.106 position:50% align:center
Let's make this
last picture a keepsake,

00:05:56.189 --> 00:05:56.940 position:50% align:center
what do you say?

00:05:57.023 --> 00:05:59.442 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA gasps]
But...

00:06:03.154 --> 00:06:05.573 position:50% align:center
You don't have to
do that... honestly.

00:06:05.657 --> 00:06:06.908 position:50% align:center
[ADOLPHE]
It's not my doing.

00:06:06.991 --> 00:06:08.827 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:13.164 position:50% align:center
My dear, the people who want you
to be included are your friends.

[gasps]

00:06:18.837 --> 00:06:21.297 position:50% align:center
[ADOLPHE] The rest of
the photos will be private!

00:06:21.381 --> 00:06:24.259 position:50% align:center
We can even use your
cell phone, if you'd like.

Shinomiya.

00:07:26.863 --> 00:07:29.282 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA]
Yeah, there's no salvaging this.

00:07:30.533 --> 00:07:33.828 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA] I probably lost all
the pictures I had saved on it.

00:07:36.164 --> 00:07:38.958 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA] Maybe I'll get a
smartphone as a replacement.

00:07:39.042 --> 00:07:42.420 position:50% align:center
I hear the photo resolution is
great with the newer models!

00:07:42.504 --> 00:07:45.090 position:50% align:center
I could finally download
that LINE app, too!

00:07:45.173 --> 00:07:46.549 position:50% align:center
It'd give me a
whole new resource

00:07:46.633 --> 00:07:49.094 position:50% align:center
for defeating the president!

00:07:49.177 --> 00:07:51.221 position:50% align:center
A blessing in disguise!

00:07:54.432 --> 00:07:56.351 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA]
It's actually a good thing!

00:07:56.434 --> 00:07:57.727 position:50% align:center
I would've never
gotten an upgrade

00:07:57.811 --> 00:07:59.229 position:50% align:center
if this hadn't happened.

00:07:59.312 --> 00:08:02.065 position:50% align:center
I'll be able to use all
sorts of fun new apps!

00:08:02.148 --> 00:08:04.025 position:50% align:center
Once I figure them out.

00:08:04.109 --> 00:08:06.403 position:50% align:center
I'm going to get a phone
with top-notch photo resolution

00:08:06.486 --> 00:08:09.864 position:50% align:center
and post a bunch of pictures
all over social media.

00:08:09.948 --> 00:08:12.784 position:50% align:center
It'll be great.

00:08:12.867 --> 00:08:16.246 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA cries]

00:08:16.329 --> 00:08:18.331 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA]
They're just pictures.

00:08:18.415 --> 00:08:20.625 position:50% align:center
What am I crying for?

00:08:22.252 --> 00:08:26.256 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA] I guess I'm more
girly than I thought.

00:08:34.556 --> 00:08:35.557 position:50% align:center
[WORKER 12A]
I'm sorry, ma'am,

00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:37.017 position:50% align:center
but not only is
this model the oldest

00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:38.560 position:50% align:center
I've seen in a long time,

00:08:38.643 --> 00:08:41.104 position:50% align:center
it has corporate
proprietary specs.

00:08:41.187 --> 00:08:43.690 position:50% align:center
I'm afraid we don't
have the parts to fix it.

00:08:43.773 --> 00:08:44.941 position:50% align:center
So unfortunately,

00:08:45.025 --> 00:08:47.944 position:50% align:center
whatever data was saved
on here is gone forever.

00:08:48.028 --> 00:08:51.197 position:50% align:center
It may have been salvageable
if you had an SD card.

00:08:51.281 --> 00:08:55.535 position:50% align:center
But with this particular model,
the data is stored internally.

00:08:55.618 --> 00:08:56.953 position:50% align:center
[HAYASAKA]
Guess that's that.

00:08:57.037 --> 00:09:00.290 position:50% align:center
Let's get you a shiny new
smartphone and head home.

00:09:00.373 --> 00:09:01.583 position:50% align:center
[HAYASAKA]
Any preference?

00:09:01.666 --> 00:09:03.126 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA]
The same one the president has.

00:09:03.209 --> 00:09:04.169 position:50% align:center
[HAYASAKA gasps]

00:09:04.252 --> 00:09:05.879 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA]
I want the exact same model.

00:09:05.962 --> 00:09:08.631 position:50% align:center
Hey! Stop and think
about this, okay?

00:09:08.715 --> 00:09:09.966 position:50% align:center
Getting the same
phone as the president

00:09:10.050 --> 00:09:12.010 position:50% align:center
could backfire in a bad way.

00:09:12.093 --> 00:09:15.638 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI] Your brand-new
smartphone sure looks familiar.

00:09:15.722 --> 00:09:18.183 position:50% align:center
You trying to match me
like a girlfriend would?

00:09:18.266 --> 00:09:21.144 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA gasps, screams]

00:09:21.227 --> 00:09:23.480 position:50% align:center
That really is quite cute.

00:09:23.563 --> 00:09:26.441 position:50% align:center
He'll say that! Or something
along those lines!

00:09:26.524 --> 00:09:28.651 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA] Do you even hear
yourself right now?

00:09:28.735 --> 00:09:30.945 position:50% align:center
The president would
never talk like that.

00:09:31.029 --> 00:09:33.365 position:50% align:center
[HAYASAKA] Well, okay,
I agree with you there.

00:09:33.448 --> 00:09:36.159 position:50% align:center
But I feel like
you just betrayed me.

00:09:36.242 --> 00:09:37.827 position:50% align:center
I'm kind of tired,

00:09:37.911 --> 00:09:40.747 position:50% align:center
and in no mood to play along
with your jokes, Hayasaka.

00:09:40.830 --> 00:09:44.626 position:50% align:center
I'm not joking,
though. I'm serious.

00:09:44.709 --> 00:09:46.711 position:50% align:center
The president's phone
is almost as old as yours,

00:09:46.795 --> 00:09:48.838 position:50% align:center
so you won't find it here.

00:09:48.922 --> 00:09:52.092 position:50% align:center
You should buy the latest model
from the same brand instead.

00:09:52.175 --> 00:09:54.260 position:50% align:center
Look. This one seems
like it would work.

00:09:54.344 --> 00:09:58.306 position:50% align:center
Its display is top of
the line, and it has 4K HDR.

00:09:58.390 --> 00:10:01.434 position:50% align:center
And some sort of anticipation
function that can sense a smile!

00:10:01.518 --> 00:10:04.562 position:50% align:center
I don't want to smile.

00:10:04.646 --> 00:10:06.815 position:50% align:center
[HAYASAKA]
No way, it's 5G? [gasps]

00:10:06.898 --> 00:10:09.567 position:50% align:center
Ultrasonic fingerprints?!
So high-tech!

00:10:09.651 --> 00:10:10.819 position:50% align:center
Wouldn't be surprised
if this phone

00:10:10.902 --> 00:10:11.986 position:50% align:center
had a time-machine feature...

00:10:12.070 --> 00:10:13.029 position:50% align:center
I don't know what
you're talking about,

00:10:13.113 --> 00:10:15.407 position:50% align:center
please just pick one.

00:10:15.490 --> 00:10:17.784 position:50% align:center
[CHIKA]
You did what? There's no way!

00:10:17.867 --> 00:10:20.704 position:50% align:center
You caved and got
a smartphone for yourself?

00:10:20.787 --> 00:10:23.707 position:50% align:center
Well, if you recall, my
other phone fell off the roof.

00:10:23.790 --> 00:10:26.084 position:50% align:center
[CHIKA] But you were dead set on
keeping your flip phone before!

00:10:26.167 --> 00:10:28.003 position:50% align:center
And convinced you didn't
need to get with the times!

00:10:28.086 --> 00:10:31.089 position:50% align:center
Like buying a new phone would
put a dent in your pride!

00:10:31.172 --> 00:10:33.174 position:50% align:center
Welcome to civilized society.

00:10:33.258 --> 00:10:34.384 position:50% align:center
Despite what you remember,

00:10:34.467 --> 00:10:36.594 position:50% align:center
I wasn't that
attached to my old phone.

00:10:37.846 --> 00:10:41.433 position:50% align:center
Um, I just installed the
LINE app, so what do I do now?

00:10:41.516 --> 00:10:44.227 position:50% align:center
[CHIKA squeals]
Let's exchange IDs!

00:10:44.310 --> 00:10:46.146 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR]
The future is here!

00:10:46.229 --> 00:10:48.773 position:50% align:center
Since flip phones are the
dinosaurs of cellular devices,

00:10:48.857 --> 00:10:51.943 position:50% align:center
Kaguya had no
choice but to upgrade.

00:10:52.027 --> 00:10:53.278 position:50% align:center
If it weren't for smartphones,

00:10:53.361 --> 00:10:56.322 position:50% align:center
high schoolers would
be completely lost.

00:10:56.406 --> 00:10:58.992 position:50% align:center
In this day and age,
everything happens via phone.

00:10:59.075 --> 00:11:01.202 position:50% align:center
And getting left unread
is one of the worst feelings

00:11:01.286 --> 00:11:02.704 position:50% align:center
known to man.

00:11:02.787 --> 00:11:05.081 position:50% align:center
Some people even use social
media to confess their love.

00:11:05.165 --> 00:11:06.374 position:50% align:center
That's right.

00:11:06.458 --> 00:11:08.585 position:50% align:center
This past year was a bust
because our two heroes

00:11:08.668 --> 00:11:10.170 position:50% align:center
weren't connected through LINE.

00:11:10.253 --> 00:11:12.756 position:50% align:center
Want a free ticket
to romance in Japan?

00:11:12.839 --> 00:11:15.300 position:50% align:center
Become a lovey-dovey
LINE friend!

00:11:15.383 --> 00:11:16.343 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI]
This is it!

00:11:16.426 --> 00:11:17.594 position:50% align:center
Now that she's
bought a smartphone,

00:11:17.677 --> 00:11:19.804 position:50% align:center
I can ask her to
exchange LINE IDs!

00:11:19.888 --> 00:11:22.098 position:50% align:center
But if I do it flat out,
I might as well rent a plane

00:11:22.182 --> 00:11:24.184 position:50% align:center
and skywrite a love
confession for everyone to see!

00:11:24.267 --> 00:11:26.478 position:50% align:center
Humans stop learning once
they reach a certain age

00:11:26.561 --> 00:11:28.313 position:50% align:center
and get stuck in their
habits, you know?

00:11:28.396 --> 00:11:30.106 position:50% align:center
[CHIKA]
Huh? That a Darwin quote?

00:11:30.190 --> 00:11:32.025 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI] What kind
of scenario could I use?

00:11:32.108 --> 00:11:34.486 position:50% align:center
Um, President?
Would it be all right

00:11:34.569 --> 00:11:36.696 position:50% align:center
if you gave me your
LINE address as well?

00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:38.782 position:50% align:center
Sure. That's fine by me.

00:11:38.865 --> 00:11:40.575 position:50% align:center
One sec, let me get my phone.

00:11:40.658 --> 00:11:42.494 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI]
Huh?

00:11:42.577 --> 00:11:44.120 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:11:44.204 --> 00:11:45.955 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI yells]

00:11:46.039 --> 00:11:47.665 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI]
She didn't use a single trick!

00:11:47.749 --> 00:11:50.126 position:50% align:center
Just straight
up asked for my ID!

00:11:50.210 --> 00:11:53.254 position:50% align:center
Wait. I could be
overlooking something here.

00:11:54.339 --> 00:11:58.009 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI] But...
it doesn't seem like I am.

00:11:59.135 --> 00:12:00.637 position:50% align:center
Hey, Fujiwara.

00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:02.847 position:50% align:center
D'you think Shinomiya's
acting strange?

00:12:02.931 --> 00:12:05.016 position:50% align:center
You're only
noticing that just now?

00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:08.019 position:50% align:center
It's been the hot topic of
conversation for the rest of us.

00:12:08.103 --> 00:12:09.562 position:50% align:center
Oh. Damn.

00:12:09.646 --> 00:12:12.899 position:50% align:center
It's weird seeing her
look more depressed than I do.

00:12:12.982 --> 00:12:15.568 position:50% align:center
Well, a relative
might've passed.

00:12:15.652 --> 00:12:17.821 position:50% align:center
It's possible she
has a tummy ache.

00:12:17.904 --> 00:12:20.323 position:50% align:center
[YU] She could've stayed up
late playing video games.

00:12:20.407 --> 00:12:22.409 position:50% align:center
[MIKO] That sounds like
something you would do, not her.

00:12:22.492 --> 00:12:25.787 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI] Maybe it has to do
with her phone breaking.

00:12:25.870 --> 00:12:27.372 position:50% align:center
[MIKO]
I'm not so sure.

00:12:27.455 --> 00:12:29.916 position:50% align:center
Shinomiya's not usually
affected by things like that.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:31.167 position:50% align:center
Let's drop it, you guys.

00:12:31.251 --> 00:12:32.419 position:50% align:center
Her family doesn't open up

00:12:32.502 --> 00:12:34.754 position:50% align:center
about their
problems to outsiders.

00:12:34.838 --> 00:12:38.633 position:50% align:center
Even spitballing like this
probably isn't a good idea.

00:12:38.717 --> 00:12:39.843 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI grunts]

00:12:39.926 --> 00:12:41.720 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR] She's got
the whole gang worried.

00:12:41.803 --> 00:12:43.054 position:50% align:center
[CHIKA]
And who knows?

00:12:43.138 --> 00:12:45.223 position:50% align:center
She might bring it up
herself if we leave her be

00:12:45.306 --> 00:12:46.766 position:50% align:center
and act like we normally would.

00:12:46.850 --> 00:12:49.436 position:50% align:center
[YU]
Yeah, that's true.

00:12:49.519 --> 00:12:50.979 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR]
They chose to play it cool

00:12:51.062 --> 00:12:54.899 position:50% align:center
and treat her like a sturdy rock
instead of a fragile flower.

00:12:54.983 --> 00:12:58.987 position:50% align:center
And some people might
view this as a jerk-move.

00:12:59.070 --> 00:13:02.032 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI] Hard to believe
we're LINE friends now.

00:13:02.115 --> 00:13:03.825 position:50% align:center
I could try and message her.

00:13:03.908 --> 00:13:06.870 position:50% align:center
--[NARRATOR] However...
--[MIYUKI] Oh, yeah.

00:13:06.953 --> 00:13:09.372 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR] It was actually the
right move.

00:13:09.456 --> 00:13:10.957 position:50% align:center
[phone chimes]

00:13:13.251 --> 00:13:14.753 position:50% align:center
What's this?

00:13:14.836 --> 00:13:17.505 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI] I just created a LINE
group for the student council.

00:13:17.589 --> 00:13:18.465 position:50% align:center
Join in.

00:13:18.548 --> 00:13:19.299 position:50% align:center
[CHIKA]
Okay!

00:13:19.382 --> 00:13:20.633 position:50% align:center
[YU]
Got it.

00:13:20.717 --> 00:13:22.802 position:50% align:center
[MIKO] So, you didn't
have a group before today?

00:13:22.886 --> 00:13:24.304 position:50% align:center
That's great!

00:13:24.387 --> 00:13:26.681 position:50% align:center
I thought maybe you all were
keeping me out of the loop.

00:13:26.765 --> 00:13:28.183 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I wouldn't do that.

00:13:28.266 --> 00:13:31.728 position:50% align:center
[gasps] While we're at it, let's
make a shared photo album!

00:13:31.811 --> 00:13:33.438 position:50% align:center
We'll fill up the
cloud with happiness

00:13:33.521 --> 00:13:35.732 position:50% align:center
and chase the rain away! Get it?

00:13:35.815 --> 00:13:36.983 position:50% align:center
[YU]
Cool.

00:13:37.067 --> 00:13:39.319 position:50% align:center
I'll add some pics
from the sports festival.

00:13:39.402 --> 00:13:41.529 position:50% align:center
And I can upload all
the photos I have of us.

00:13:41.613 --> 00:13:42.447 position:50% align:center
[phone chiming]

00:13:42.530 --> 00:13:43.865 position:50% align:center
[CHIKA]
Yes! They're so cute!

00:13:43.948 --> 00:13:46.868 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:13:46.951 --> 00:13:49.871 position:50% align:center
Hey, so the president
decided a long time ago

00:13:49.954 --> 00:13:53.041 position:50% align:center
he wasn't gonna make a group
until you got a smartphone.

00:13:53.124 --> 00:13:54.417 position:50% align:center
"We're not doing it yet,

00:13:54.501 --> 00:13:56.878 position:50% align:center
because I don't want her
to feel left out." [giggles]

00:13:56.961 --> 00:13:58.588 position:50% align:center
The timing is perfect, though!

00:13:58.672 --> 00:14:00.757 position:50% align:center
You couldn't transfer
your old data, right?

00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:02.926 position:50% align:center
Now you can add our
pictures to yours!

00:14:03.009 --> 00:14:04.135 position:50% align:center
It doesn't get much sadder

00:14:04.219 --> 00:14:07.222 position:50% align:center
than a phone without
any memories in it!

00:14:07.305 --> 00:14:10.016 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR] The loss of a cell
phone is one thing.

00:14:10.100 --> 00:14:11.559 position:50% align:center
But the loss of
the pictures she had

00:14:11.643 --> 00:14:15.146 position:50% align:center
with a certain special someone
was far more substantial.

00:14:15.230 --> 00:14:17.273 position:50% align:center
[phone chimes]

00:14:17.357 --> 00:14:20.110 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR] They were proof
of the moments they shared.

00:14:20.193 --> 00:14:22.821 position:50% align:center

[KAGUYA] So long as it doesn't
pop on my turn, I'm victorious!

00:21:19.612 --> 00:21:21.406 position:50% align:center
I'm only doing this
because I want to win!

00:21:21.489 --> 00:21:22.866 position:50% align:center
It has nothing to do
with me being afraid!

Was that a... bug?

00:21:28.538 --> 00:21:30.665 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA] Yes! It was
flying around your head!

00:21:30.749 --> 00:21:32.584 position:50% align:center

Game over, man!

Shinomiya.

00:21:37.464 --> 00:21:40.342 position:50% align:center
This must be harder for
you than the rest of us.

00:21:40.425 --> 00:21:41.676 position:50% align:center
I bet you're only
playing because

00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:44.054 position:50% align:center
you didn't want to
ruin it for everyone else.

00:21:44.137 --> 00:21:45.930 position:50% align:center
If that's the case...

[PAPA SHIROGANE]
Miyuki.

00:21:48.892 --> 00:21:52.437 position:50% align:center
I'm not what you'd
classify as a "good person."

00:21:52.520 --> 00:21:56.024 position:50% align:center
There isn't anything I can teach
you you can't learn from a book.

00:21:56.107 --> 00:21:59.694 position:50% align:center
But... I want you to
make me a promise, okay?

00:21:59.778 --> 00:22:02.030 position:50% align:center
Promise you'll always
protect your friends

00:22:02.113 --> 00:22:03.531 position:50% align:center
and the woman you love,

00:22:03.615 --> 00:22:06.868 position:50% align:center
because that's what
a good man's supposed to do.

00:22:06.951 --> 00:22:10.538 position:50% align:center
He doesn't back down.
He faces problems head-on.

00:22:10.622 --> 00:22:13.083 position:50% align:center
Become that kind of man.

00:22:14.542 --> 00:22:17.962 position:50% align:center
That's the one thing
I ask of you, father to son.

00:22:18.046 --> 00:22:19.589 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI]
Dad...

00:22:19.673 --> 00:22:22.550 position:50% align:center

his father's touching words...

00:22:22.634 --> 00:22:24.386 position:50% align:center
Hey! Looks like
it's your turn again!

00:22:24.469 --> 00:22:26.471 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR]
...and completely ignored them!

00:22:26.554 --> 00:22:29.933 position:50% align:center
Well, good luck to ya!

00:22:30.016 --> 00:22:32.435 position:50% align:center
Thanks for the tangerine!

[NARRATOR]
Just in case you missed it,

00:22:33.853 --> 00:22:35.980 position:50% align:center
those citrus rinds
contain limonene,

00:22:36.064 --> 00:22:37.357 position:50% align:center
which can dissolve rubber.

00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:40.110 position:50% align:center
So if one drop of juice
were to hit that balloon...

00:22:40.193 --> 00:22:41.736 position:50% align:center
Yep!

00:22:42.404 --> 00:22:44.614 position:50% align:center
Good-bye, cruel world.

today's battle are... invalid.

[MIYUKI sighs]
Think, Miyuki.

00:23:25.655 --> 00:23:27.907 position:50% align:center
Don't lend her a hand
like it's nothing.

00:23:27.991 --> 00:23:30.702 position:50% align:center
Stay calm, cool, and collected

00:23:30.785 --> 00:23:32.996 position:50% align:center
as you draw out her
affection for you!

Now's your chance, Kaguya.

Put your girlish
wiles to good use!

hand, he'll be putty in it!

Yes.

[KAGUYA]
And if all goes well...

00:23:52.974 --> 00:23:55.685 position:50% align:center

his love for me!

And on, and on, on, on, onward!

00:24:05.403 --> 00:24:09.074 position:50% align:center
On and--yeah, you get the idea.
