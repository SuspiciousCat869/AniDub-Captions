00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:14.597 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR] The fifth member
of Shuchiin Academy's

00:00:14.681 --> 00:00:17.350 position:50% align:center
Student Council,
Financial Auditor, Miko Iino!

00:00:17.434 --> 00:00:20.353 position:50% align:center
Only a few days have passed
since she joined the group.

00:00:20.437 --> 00:00:21.229 position:50% align:center
However...

00:00:21.312 --> 00:00:22.689 position:50% align:center
[MIKO]
So...

00:00:22.772 --> 00:00:24.733 position:50% align:center
I think I'm going to resign.

00:00:24.816 --> 00:00:26.651 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR]
She already wants to quit?

00:00:26.735 --> 00:00:29.612 position:50% align:center
Wha...

00:01:59.035 --> 00:02:01.162 position:50% align:center
[OSARAGI]
...aat?

00:02:01.246 --> 00:02:03.248 position:50% align:center
You've dreamed about being
a part of the student council

00:02:03.331 --> 00:02:05.166 position:50% align:center
since you were little.
Why resign?

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.211 position:50% align:center
[MIKO] That's true. It's
something I've always wanted.

00:02:08.294 --> 00:02:11.089 position:50% align:center
And I was ecstatic
when I got appointed!

00:02:11.172 --> 00:02:15.510 position:50% align:center
It's just... I had expectations
of what it would be like.

00:02:15.593 --> 00:02:18.805 position:50% align:center
I could picture it
so vividly in my mind!

00:02:20.223 --> 00:02:21.349 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR]
This is the story of

00:02:21.433 --> 00:02:24.060 position:50% align:center
a small high-school
girl with big ideals.

00:02:24.144 --> 00:02:26.646 position:50% align:center
She's looked rejection in
the face countless times,

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.481 position:50% align:center
but still she perseveres!

00:02:28.565 --> 00:02:31.067 position:50% align:center
A heroine who's true to
herself and strives to create

00:02:31.151 --> 00:02:33.862 position:50% align:center
a new and improved student
council no matter the cost!

00:02:33.945 --> 00:02:36.489 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI]
You bumbling moron!

00:02:36.573 --> 00:02:39.826 position:50% align:center
It was a simple task,
yet you still botched it!

00:02:39.909 --> 00:02:42.245 position:50% align:center
Losers have no place
on my council!

00:02:42.328 --> 00:02:43.246 position:50% align:center
[MIKO grunts]

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:45.790 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR]
A merciless meritocracy!

00:02:45.874 --> 00:02:47.542 position:50% align:center
Expel them.

00:02:47.625 --> 00:02:49.336 position:50% align:center
We'll expel them all!

00:02:49.419 --> 00:02:50.253 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:02:50.337 --> 00:02:51.796 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA]
Good plan, President.

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:54.466 position:50% align:center
We should dispose of the
rotten apples as soon as we can.

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:58.053 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR] A council consisting
of coldhearted characters.

00:02:58.136 --> 00:02:59.512 position:50% align:center
[MIKO]
Please, wait!

00:02:59.596 --> 00:03:01.723 position:50% align:center
It's normal for young
people to make mistakes!

00:03:01.806 --> 00:03:05.435 position:50% align:center
Expelling them for
one mishap isn't fair!

00:03:05.518 --> 00:03:08.938 position:50% align:center
Punishments should fit the
crime, and yours is too severe!

00:03:09.022 --> 00:03:10.523 position:50% align:center
Is this really what you want?

00:03:10.607 --> 00:03:11.983 position:50% align:center
Using fear to
control the students?!

00:03:12.067 --> 00:03:13.735 position:50% align:center
Quiet. Such cheap sentiments

00:03:13.818 --> 00:03:16.196 position:50% align:center
would do nothing to
benefit this council.

00:03:16.279 --> 00:03:18.948 position:50% align:center
What useful purpose
could they possibly serve?

00:03:19.032 --> 00:03:21.534 position:50% align:center
The only people the council
looks out for are the elite.

00:03:21.618 --> 00:03:23.495 position:50% align:center
AKA, our own kind.

00:03:23.578 --> 00:03:24.996 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI, KAGUYA]
If that bothers you,

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:27.957 position:50% align:center
and you want to oppose us
because you can't stand it...

00:03:28.041 --> 00:03:31.086 position:50% align:center
...you might as well leave now!

00:03:31.169 --> 00:03:34.589 position:50% align:center
Why, though?
Why don't they understand?

00:03:34.673 --> 00:03:36.883 position:50% align:center
[MIKO] At this rate, the student
council and the academy

00:03:36.966 --> 00:03:39.010 position:50% align:center
will both fall to ruin!

00:03:39.094 --> 00:03:42.097 position:50% align:center
Oh, wait. I know! The kind
and compassionate Fujiwara

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:44.849 position:50% align:center
will see exactly
where I'm coming from!

00:03:46.893 --> 00:03:50.689 position:50% align:center
[CHIKA] Kaguya is
a dear friend of mine.

00:03:50.772 --> 00:03:54.234 position:50% align:center
I'll shoulder all
of her sins with her.

00:03:54.317 --> 00:03:57.654 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR]
Tears of an angel.

00:03:57.737 --> 00:03:59.072 position:50% align:center
Did you forget?

00:03:59.155 --> 00:04:01.366 position:50% align:center
There's something that
only you have the power to do.

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:03.535 position:50% align:center
So do it already.

00:04:06.204 --> 00:04:08.498 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR]
She was given a precious gift.

00:04:08.581 --> 00:04:12.877 position:50% align:center
And that gift was hope.

00:04:12.961 --> 00:04:16.214 position:50% align:center
Every student signed!
Here! Read it!

00:04:16.297 --> 00:04:19.009 position:50% align:center
They all want the punishments
revoked!

00:04:19.092 --> 00:04:21.803 position:50% align:center
Probably wasn't the smartest
way to do it... but I--

00:04:21.886 --> 00:04:24.014 position:50% align:center
Well, it's the way
I chose to do it!

00:04:24.097 --> 00:04:25.807 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI chuckles]

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:28.184 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI]
So it is.

00:04:28.268 --> 00:04:30.186 position:50% align:center
I like her style.

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:32.397 position:50% align:center
That girl may be
just what we needed.

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:34.774 position:50% align:center
Who'd have thought?

00:04:34.858 --> 00:04:36.484 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR]
Thus, the student council would

00:04:36.568 --> 00:04:39.112 position:50% align:center
slowly begin to
transform for the better.

00:04:39.195 --> 00:04:43.700 position:50% align:center
And it's all thanks to
the small girl with big ideals.

00:04:43.783 --> 00:04:45.201 position:50% align:center
That's my arc!

00:04:45.285 --> 00:04:47.912 position:50% align:center
You know, you have a really
impressive imagination.

00:04:47.996 --> 00:04:49.622 position:50% align:center
But you forgot
to include Ishigami

00:04:49.706 --> 00:04:50.832 position:50% align:center
in your little scenario.

00:04:50.915 --> 00:04:52.417 position:50% align:center
Why would I waste a
single moment of my life

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:54.002 position:50% align:center
thinking about someone like him?

00:04:54.085 --> 00:04:55.587 position:50% align:center
[OSARAGI]
Aw, poor guy.

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:58.590 position:50% align:center
[MIKO] I was genuinely excited
when I joined Student Council.

00:04:58.673 --> 00:05:00.342 position:50% align:center
[MIKO] That was before I knew.

00:05:00.425 --> 00:05:01.718 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI]
No!

00:05:01.801 --> 00:05:04.179 position:50% align:center
If I feel any better than I
already do, I'll die!

00:05:04.262 --> 00:05:05.347 position:50% align:center
I'm a filthy black
panties kinda guy!

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:07.849 position:50% align:center
[MIKO] They're all
thirsty for each other!

00:05:07.932 --> 00:05:09.893 position:50% align:center
It's only a matter of time
before I fall victim

00:05:09.976 --> 00:05:12.896 position:50% align:center
to their grabby hands
if I don't hurry and resign.

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:15.565 position:50% align:center
But it took me so
long to get here.

00:05:15.648 --> 00:05:17.567 position:50% align:center
And nothing would make
me feel more like a quitter

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:19.110 position:50% align:center
than leaving now.

00:05:19.194 --> 00:05:20.987 position:50% align:center
You need to lighten up.

00:05:21.071 --> 00:05:22.739 position:50% align:center
Even though it's not
what you thought it'd be,

00:05:22.822 --> 00:05:25.408 position:50% align:center
I still think it's in your
best interest to tough it out.

00:05:25.492 --> 00:05:27.827 position:50% align:center
Is that supposed to
make any kind of sense?!

00:05:27.911 --> 00:05:29.412 position:50% align:center
[OSARAGI]
I'm into it.

00:05:29.496 --> 00:05:31.915 position:50% align:center
I find what you're describing
rather appealing, personally.

00:05:31.998 --> 00:05:34.042 position:50% align:center
[MIKO] Leave your fantasies
out of my decision-making!

00:05:34.125 --> 00:05:36.378 position:50% align:center
The kind of love I want
isn't tainted by lust!

00:05:36.461 --> 00:05:37.796 position:50% align:center
It's perfectly wholesome!

00:05:37.879 --> 00:05:40.674 position:50% align:center
And I refuse to be sullied!

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:46.930 position:50% align:center
[MIKO] Junior high was easily
the worst time of my life.

00:05:47.013 --> 00:05:49.391 position:50% align:center
Everybody went out of
their way to avoid me.

00:05:49.474 --> 00:05:52.268 position:50% align:center
But there was one person who
secretly tried to cheer me up.

00:05:52.352 --> 00:05:55.563 position:50% align:center
And they didn't even ask
for anything in return.

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:03.321 position:50% align:center
[MIKO] That sort of selfless act
is what true love is all about!

00:06:03.405 --> 00:06:04.322 position:50% align:center
[OSARAGI]
Earth to Miko.

00:06:04.406 --> 00:06:05.281 position:50% align:center
Come in, Miko.

00:06:05.365 --> 00:06:06.741 position:50% align:center
Something as fragile as a flower

00:06:06.825 --> 00:06:08.827 position:50% align:center
was able to give me
the strength to press on.

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:11.037 position:50% align:center
[OSARAGI] You can stop there.
I've heard that story.

00:06:11.121 --> 00:06:12.247 position:50% align:center
About ten times, in fact.

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:14.082 position:50% align:center
[MIKO] The point is,
the president may value

00:06:14.165 --> 00:06:16.084 position:50% align:center
lust over love, but
I'm the complete opposite!

00:06:16.167 --> 00:06:18.670 position:50% align:center
[OSARAGI] Miko tends to let
her imagination run rampant.

00:06:18.753 --> 00:06:20.630 position:50% align:center
And because she mixes
fact with fiction,

00:06:20.714 --> 00:06:23.258 position:50% align:center
she often jumps to
the wrong conclusions.

00:06:23.341 --> 00:06:25.802 position:50% align:center
She makes it sound like the
president's lust incarnate,

00:06:25.885 --> 00:06:29.264 position:50% align:center
but my guess is she's mistaken.

00:06:29.347 --> 00:06:30.181 position:50% align:center
[OSARAGI]
All right, then...

00:06:30.265 --> 00:06:31.766 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:34.519 position:50% align:center
Let's take a moment and analyze
some of these stories of yours.

00:06:34.602 --> 00:06:36.730 position:50% align:center
Like the "man whore" incident.

00:06:36.813 --> 00:06:38.773 position:50% align:center
[OSARAGI] It seems out of
character for the vice president

00:06:38.857 --> 00:06:41.317 position:50% align:center
to use such a crude expression,
don't you think?

00:06:41.401 --> 00:06:42.444 position:50% align:center
[MIKO] Well.

00:06:42.527 --> 00:06:44.154 position:50% align:center
I suppose that's true.

00:06:44.237 --> 00:06:45.655 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI groans]

00:06:45.739 --> 00:06:46.990 position:50% align:center
[OSARAGI]
What if you misheard

00:06:47.073 --> 00:06:48.658 position:50% align:center
and she actually said
"brand sore" or something?

00:06:48.742 --> 00:06:50.452 position:50% align:center
That's so graphic!

00:06:50.535 --> 00:06:52.078 position:50% align:center
The vice president
also doesn't strike me

00:06:52.162 --> 00:06:54.998 position:50% align:center
as a girl who would allow
boys to take advantage of her.

00:06:55.081 --> 00:06:57.042 position:50% align:center
Which is why I'm fairly
certain your perception

00:06:57.125 --> 00:06:58.626 position:50% align:center
of the president is way off.

00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:01.046 position:50% align:center
If you're right
about that, then...

00:07:01.129 --> 00:07:02.797 position:50% align:center
...it means...

00:07:05.592 --> 00:07:06.593 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA]
President...

00:07:06.676 --> 00:07:07.594 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI grunts]

00:07:07.677 --> 00:07:09.596 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA]
...let me hear you say it.

00:07:09.679 --> 00:07:12.390 position:50% align:center
Tell me about what
a filthy pig you are.

00:07:12.474 --> 00:07:15.226 position:50% align:center
Say you absolutely love black
panties and the very thought

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:17.145 position:50% align:center
of me wearing them
just drives you wild!

00:07:17.228 --> 00:07:19.856 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI grunts]
It's not true, though.

00:07:19.939 --> 00:07:23.735 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA] Are you actually
refusing to obey me?

00:07:23.818 --> 00:07:26.321 position:50% align:center
Hm. I could always
give you another one...

00:07:26.404 --> 00:07:27.280 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI gasps]

00:07:27.364 --> 00:07:29.908 position:50% align:center
Another brand sore, that is.

00:07:29.991 --> 00:07:33.286 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR] And just like that,
he's no longer a man whore.

00:07:34.746 --> 00:07:38.416 position:50% align:center
[CHIKA] I think you've
overstepped a line here, Kaguya.

00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:40.418 position:50% align:center
You dare to speak
out against me?

00:07:40.502 --> 00:07:41.795 position:50% align:center
Ishigami.

00:07:41.878 --> 00:07:43.046 position:50% align:center
President.

00:07:43.129 --> 00:07:44.923 position:50% align:center
Tape up this heathen's mouth!

00:07:45.006 --> 00:07:47.258 position:50% align:center
[CHIKA screams]

00:07:47.342 --> 00:07:49.094 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR] That explains
the duct tape, too!

00:07:49.177 --> 00:07:51.012 position:50% align:center
[YU] I hate that we
have to do crap like this.

00:07:51.096 --> 00:07:52.138 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI]
It kinda excites me.

00:07:52.222 --> 00:07:53.390 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA]
While you're at it,

00:07:53.473 --> 00:07:55.141 position:50% align:center
make sure you boys
tape your mouths, as well.

00:07:55.225 --> 00:07:57.310 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI, YU scream]

00:07:57.394 --> 00:07:58.895 position:50% align:center
President.

00:07:58.978 --> 00:08:02.065 position:50% align:center
What do you suppose Iino would
think if she saw you like this?

00:08:02.148 --> 00:08:03.191 position:50% align:center

been more scared in my life!

[MIKO]
You scumbag!

00:08:13.243 --> 00:08:16.371 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA] Now the student
council is mine for the taking!

incident is also cleared up!

00:08:18.832 --> 00:08:21.668 position:50% align:center
tell me how good this makes
you feel, Mr. President!

00:08:21.751 --> 00:08:23.211 position:50% align:center
Say it! Say it!

00:08:23.294 --> 00:08:26.464 position:50% align:center
It hurts so good, mistress!
If I felt any better, I'd die!

[MIKO screaming]

00:08:27.716 --> 00:08:29.259 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR]
Basically, everything's cleared!

[MIKO] How could I have
misunderstood so much?

00:08:32.095 --> 00:08:34.556 position:50% align:center
President Shirogane
hasn't done anything wrong!

00:08:34.639 --> 00:08:36.307 position:50% align:center
[OSARAGI]
Mmm-hmm.

00:08:36.391 --> 00:08:37.642 position:50% align:center
That Shinomiya girl!

00:08:37.726 --> 00:08:39.728 position:50% align:center
She's the one who's really
at fault in all of this!

00:08:39.811 --> 00:08:40.854 position:50% align:center
[OSARAGI]
Wait, what...?

00:08:40.937 --> 00:08:42.689 position:50% align:center
[MIKO]
I was straight up used!

00:08:42.772 --> 00:08:45.108 position:50% align:center
She played the victim card
to take the president down,

00:08:45.191 --> 00:08:46.651 position:50% align:center
and I fell for it!

00:08:46.735 --> 00:08:48.862 position:50% align:center
[grunts] Never again!

00:08:48.945 --> 00:08:50.613 position:50% align:center
Miko, can we at least
talk this through?!

00:08:50.697 --> 00:08:51.740 position:50% align:center
[MIKO]
I don't have time to talk!

00:08:51.823 --> 00:08:53.283 position:50% align:center

Iino... Are you okay?

00:08:58.747 --> 00:09:00.623 position:50% align:center
The jig is up. I know!

00:09:00.707 --> 00:09:02.292 position:50% align:center
You can try and deny it,

00:09:02.375 --> 00:09:04.627 position:50% align:center
but the truth will
eventually reveal itself!

00:09:04.711 --> 00:09:07.297 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA]
Um, I'm sorry, you lost me.

00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:08.923 position:50% align:center
Sure, you're the president's
second in command,

00:09:09.007 --> 00:09:10.592 position:50% align:center
but what do you
really think of him?!

00:09:10.675 --> 00:09:12.844 position:50% align:center
I honestly don't understand
what you're asking.

00:09:12.927 --> 00:09:14.220 position:50% align:center
[MIKO]
I'm asking you to tell me

00:09:14.304 --> 00:09:16.139 position:50% align:center
what you think of
President Shirogane!

00:09:16.222 --> 00:09:17.932 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA gasps]

00:09:18.016 --> 00:09:22.437 position:50% align:center
You wanna know... what I truly
think about the president?

00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:24.022 position:50% align:center
Iino...

00:09:24.105 --> 00:09:27.317 position:50% align:center
Why would you barge in here and
ask me such a personal question?

00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:29.069 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:09:29.152 --> 00:09:34.366 position:50% align:center
Especially... when the answer
still eludes me to this day.

00:09:38.036 --> 00:09:39.454 position:50% align:center
Wait, what?

00:09:39.537 --> 00:09:42.082 position:50% align:center
Now I'm even more
confused than I was before!

00:09:42.165 --> 00:09:43.708 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR]
And understandably so,

00:09:43.792 --> 00:09:45.752 position:50% align:center
'cause that was one
of the purest responses

00:09:45.835 --> 00:09:47.671 position:50% align:center
Kaguya could've given.

00:09:47.754 --> 00:09:51.841 position:50% align:center
Results for today's battle:
Iino undoubtedly loses.

00:09:59.140 --> 00:10:01.184 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI] Shinomiya's been
acting strange ever since

00:10:01.267 --> 00:10:04.020 position:50% align:center
she collapsed and
went to the hospital.

00:10:05.897 --> 00:10:07.482 position:50% align:center
Oh, hey there.

00:10:07.565 --> 00:10:08.942 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA]
President.

00:10:09.025 --> 00:10:11.653 position:50% align:center
I forgot, but I have
something to do today,

00:10:11.736 --> 00:10:13.154 position:50% align:center
so I have to leave early!

00:10:13.238 --> 00:10:15.949 position:50% align:center
Uh... okay.

00:10:16.032 --> 00:10:18.535 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI] She takes
off as soon as I get here.

00:10:18.618 --> 00:10:20.870 position:50% align:center
She won't even
look me in the eye.

00:10:20.954 --> 00:10:23.915 position:50% align:center
It's like... she's avoiding me.

00:10:25.291 --> 00:10:28.753 position:50% align:center
[HAYASAKA] I don't understand.
Why did you run away from him?

00:10:28.837 --> 00:10:30.714 position:50% align:center
[inhales]

00:10:30.797 --> 00:10:32.132 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA]
If I had any say in the matter,

00:10:32.215 --> 00:10:33.550 position:50% align:center
you know I wouldn't
have run away!

00:10:33.633 --> 00:10:34.509 position:50% align:center
It's just--

00:10:34.592 --> 00:10:36.052 position:50% align:center
Every time I see him,

00:10:36.136 --> 00:10:37.637 position:50% align:center
it reminds me of what happened
inside the sports equipment

00:10:37.721 --> 00:10:39.806 position:50% align:center
warehouse and my
head starts spinning!

00:10:39.889 --> 00:10:41.099 position:50% align:center
[HAYASAKA]
Uhh...

00:10:41.182 --> 00:10:43.143 position:50% align:center
It's probably a brain disorder.

00:10:43.226 --> 00:10:45.520 position:50% align:center
What'll I do if
I get a blood clot?

00:10:45.603 --> 00:10:46.688 position:50% align:center
First the heart disease scare,

00:10:46.771 --> 00:10:49.315 position:50% align:center
and now you think
you have brain damage?

00:10:49.399 --> 00:10:52.360 position:50% align:center
Next you'll be making an
appointment with a neurosurgeon.

00:10:52.444 --> 00:10:54.404 position:50% align:center
I better come up with
some countermeasures.

00:10:54.487 --> 00:10:57.157 position:50% align:center
If you have any better
ideas, I'm all ears.

00:10:57.240 --> 00:11:00.994 position:50% align:center
[HAYASAKA]
Hmm...

00:11:02.037 --> 00:11:04.831 position:50% align:center
I've got it.
Let's use a calming ritual.

00:11:04.914 --> 00:11:06.041 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR]
Rituals!

00:11:06.124 --> 00:11:08.460 position:50% align:center
People like professional
athletes use rituals

00:11:08.543 --> 00:11:10.086 position:50% align:center
to keep their emotions in check.

00:11:10.170 --> 00:11:11.671 position:50% align:center
Performing these routine habits

00:11:11.755 --> 00:11:14.841 position:50% align:center
resets their mental patterns
and allows them to remain calm,

00:11:14.924 --> 00:11:17.135 position:50% align:center
even while under
severe pressure.

00:11:17.218 --> 00:11:18.678 position:50% align:center
[HAYASAKA]
If we're going to do this,

00:11:18.762 --> 00:11:21.473 position:50% align:center
we need a ritual that's both
comfortable and natural for you

00:11:21.556 --> 00:11:23.683 position:50% align:center
Now try moving around
till something feels right.

00:11:23.767 --> 00:11:26.227 position:50% align:center
Come on, now. Strike a pose,
there's nothing to it.

00:11:26.311 --> 00:11:28.438 position:50% align:center
I guess I'll give it a shot.

00:11:30.482 --> 00:11:35.487 position:50% align:center
[music plays]

00:11:42.077 --> 00:11:44.746 position:50% align:center
The music's kinda making
it hard to concentrate.

00:11:44.829 --> 00:11:48.041 position:50% align:center
[HAYASAKA] It's helping,
even if you don't realize it.

00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:51.878 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:11:53.046 --> 00:11:56.591 position:50% align:center
Maybe this? It
feels so comforting.

00:11:56.675 --> 00:11:57.926 position:50% align:center
[HAYASAKA]
Excellent.

00:11:58.009 --> 00:11:59.427 position:50% align:center
Caressing your left cheek
with your right hand'll

00:11:59.511 --> 00:12:01.137 position:50% align:center
be your ritual from now on.

00:12:01.221 --> 00:12:03.431 position:50% align:center
So, don't forget.

00:12:03.515 --> 00:12:05.767 position:50% align:center
The next part is going
to be a little trickier.

00:12:05.850 --> 00:12:07.852 position:50% align:center
We need to make it
second nature to you.

00:12:07.936 --> 00:12:10.897 position:50% align:center
The gesture must be
associated with calmness.

00:12:10.980 --> 00:12:12.315 position:50% align:center
From now on,

00:12:12.399 --> 00:12:13.983 position:50% align:center
I want you to touch your
left cheek with your right hand

00:12:14.067 --> 00:12:16.528 position:50% align:center
any time you feel relaxed, okay?

00:12:16.611 --> 00:12:18.196 position:50% align:center
It may seem like a simple thing,

00:12:18.279 --> 00:12:21.032 position:50% align:center
but hardwiring your brain to
think like this will help you.

00:12:21.116 --> 00:12:23.243 position:50% align:center
You'll be able to remain
calm no matter how fast

00:12:23.326 --> 00:12:24.452 position:50% align:center
he's making your head spin.

00:12:24.536 --> 00:12:26.788 position:50% align:center
I understand.

00:12:26.871 --> 00:12:28.164 position:50% align:center
Once you have it mastered,

00:12:28.248 --> 00:12:30.792 position:50% align:center
this will become a powerful
weapon in your arsenal.

00:12:30.875 --> 00:12:34.462 position:50% align:center
Although, I'm still clueless as
to what exactly you're battling.

00:12:34.546 --> 00:12:36.339 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR]
Thanks to Hayasaka's guidance,

00:12:36.423 --> 00:12:39.509 position:50% align:center
Kaguya begins caressing her

00:12:39.592 --> 00:12:41.469 position:50% align:center
whenever she's in
a state of relaxation

00:12:41.553 --> 00:12:43.847 position:50% align:center
in order to
establish her ritual.

00:12:43.930 --> 00:12:45.306 position:50% align:center
And a few days later...

00:12:45.390 --> 00:12:47.434 position:50% align:center
And now... look here!

00:12:47.517 --> 00:12:48.518 position:50% align:center
It's your future hubby.

[KAGUYA gasps]

00:12:49.602 --> 00:12:52.230 position:50% align:center
[HAYASAKA]
Okay. Touch your cheek.

00:12:52.313 --> 00:12:53.690 position:50% align:center
I'm impressed.

00:12:53.773 --> 00:12:55.900 position:50% align:center
You mastered your
ritual very quickly.

00:12:55.984 --> 00:12:57.986 position:50% align:center
It's been a while since I
thought you were a genius.

00:12:58.069 --> 00:13:00.113 position:50% align:center
Nice to have the smart you back.

00:13:00.196 --> 00:13:02.157 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA] I wasn't aware
there was a "stupid me."

00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:04.576 position:50% align:center
[HAYASAKA] Now you can
remain calm no matter what--

00:13:04.659 --> 00:13:07.328 position:50% align:center
even if he almost kisses you.

00:13:07.412 --> 00:13:09.205 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA grunts]

00:13:09.289 --> 00:13:10.707 position:50% align:center
Oh, wow.

00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:13.168 position:50% align:center
Kissing?

00:13:13.251 --> 00:13:14.586 position:50% align:center
Big deal.

00:13:14.669 --> 00:13:17.255 position:50% align:center
[HAYASAKA] Now let go of
your face and say that again.

00:13:17.339 --> 00:13:20.383 position:50% align:center
[bell tolls]

00:13:20.467 --> 00:13:22.469 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA]
I refuse to run away today.

00:13:22.552 --> 00:13:25.472 position:50% align:center
And thanks to my calming ritual,
I won't need to!

00:13:27.974 --> 00:13:29.768 position:50% align:center
Shinomiya.

00:13:29.851 --> 00:13:31.478 position:50% align:center
President.

00:13:31.561 --> 00:13:32.937 position:50% align:center
Remember,

00:13:33.021 --> 00:13:35.190 position:50% align:center
only resort to using your
ritual at critical moments.

00:13:35.273 --> 00:13:37.108 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA] I'll be sure
to keep that in mind.

00:13:37.192 --> 00:13:38.526 position:50% align:center
[VOICE]
Fight!

00:13:38.610 --> 00:13:40.779 position:50% align:center
Not sure why,

00:13:40.862 --> 00:13:46.701 position:50% align:center
but you've been avoiding
me lately, haven't you?

00:13:46.785 --> 00:13:48.328 position:50% align:center
Why would you say such a thing?

00:13:48.411 --> 00:13:51.164 position:50% align:center
Don't play dumb! Any
time I show up, you leave!

00:13:51.247 --> 00:13:53.291 position:50% align:center
If you've got something
to say, say it!

00:13:53.375 --> 00:13:56.711 position:50% align:center

He's getting way too close!

00:13:58.088 --> 00:13:59.714 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI]
Stop running.

00:13:59.798 --> 00:14:00.965 position:50% align:center
I just wanna talk to you.

00:14:01.049 --> 00:14:02.050 position:50% align:center
[gun fires]

00:14:02.133 --> 00:14:05.095 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA] Oh, no.
I'm getting dizzy again.

00:14:05.178 --> 00:14:08.431 position:50% align:center
But it's one problem
I know how to fix!

00:14:08.515 --> 00:14:12.018 position:50% align:center
Once I activate my ritual,
I'll be unstoppable!

00:14:12.102 --> 00:14:14.688 position:50% align:center
Just gotta touch my left
cheek with my right hand.

00:14:14.771 --> 00:14:16.481 position:50% align:center
The same hand...

00:14:16.564 --> 00:14:18.608 position:50% align:center
...he's holding.

00:14:18.692 --> 00:14:20.819 position:50% align:center
Is this seriously
my life right now?!

00:14:20.902 --> 00:14:22.404 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA yells]
Let go of me!

00:14:22.487 --> 00:14:24.447 position:50% align:center
If I do that, you'll run away!

00:14:24.531 --> 00:14:25.657 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA]
What should I do?

00:14:25.740 --> 00:14:27.242 position:50% align:center
I could shake him off
using a joint lock,

00:14:27.325 --> 00:14:28.702 position:50% align:center
but I don't wanna hurt him!

00:14:28.785 --> 00:14:31.746 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI] I can't take the
silent treatment any longer!

The other day, did the
doctors find something?

[gasps]

00:14:36.042 --> 00:14:37.460 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI]
Or...

00:14:37.544 --> 00:14:39.337 position:50% align:center
...without realizing it did...

00:14:39.421 --> 00:14:41.423 position:50% align:center
...I do something to
make you start hating me?

[KAGUYA gasps]

00:14:43.299 --> 00:14:46.136 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA] You've done nothing
to make me hate you. I promise.

00:14:46.219 --> 00:14:47.887 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI]
Then...

00:14:47.971 --> 00:14:51.641 position:50% align:center
...is this about how we almost
kissed in that warehouse?

00:14:51.725 --> 00:14:54.936 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA screams]

00:14:55.020 --> 00:14:56.229 position:50% align:center
That was a misunderstanding!

00:14:56.312 --> 00:14:57.355 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA gasps]

00:14:57.439 --> 00:14:58.773 position:50% align:center
I was only trying
to break your fall!

00:14:58.857 --> 00:15:00.316 position:50% align:center
I didn't mean to
land on top of you!

00:15:01.943 --> 00:15:03.236 position:50% align:center
But then!

00:15:03.319 --> 00:15:04.904 position:50% align:center
I don't know, you made
this face like you wanted to

00:15:04.988 --> 00:15:06.865 position:50% align:center
and I didn't even know
what I wanted until then!

Results for today's battle:

Kaguya wins by a knockout.

00:15:26.176 --> 00:15:27.385 position:50% align:center
Even though calming
rituals among

00:15:27.469 --> 00:15:28.803 position:50% align:center
professional athletes
go way back,

00:15:28.887 --> 00:15:30.722 position:50% align:center
the second they become the
media's next shiny thing,

00:15:30.805 --> 00:15:33.141 position:50% align:center
people start imitating them and
they lose their deeper meaning.

00:15:33.224 --> 00:15:34.684 position:50% align:center
High school athletes
are the worst ones,

00:15:34.768 --> 00:15:36.686 position:50% align:center
throwing their water bottles
into a trashcan because they saw

00:15:36.770 --> 00:15:38.229 position:50% align:center
some big name sports hero do it,

00:15:38.313 --> 00:15:39.773 position:50% align:center
but rituals are something
you do on the daily,

00:15:39.856 --> 00:15:41.399 position:50% align:center
not because someone
made it look awesome.

Cheerleaders.

Annoying-ass goody two shoes

00:15:47.864 --> 00:15:50.033 position:50% align:center
who make everything
they do look fun.

00:15:50.116 --> 00:15:53.536 position:50% align:center
I used to wish they'd
all just disappear.

00:15:53.620 --> 00:15:57.499 position:50% align:center
Eventually, I came to realize
I was wrong to think that way.

00:15:57.582 --> 00:15:59.709 position:50% align:center
The pathetic one
was actually me.

00:15:59.793 --> 00:16:01.086 position:50% align:center
They had a hobby,

00:16:01.169 --> 00:16:03.963 position:50% align:center
but the only hobby I had
was complaining about them.

00:16:04.047 --> 00:16:05.173 position:50% align:center
[TEACHER 9A]
Do we have any volunteers

00:16:05.256 --> 00:16:07.759 position:50% align:center
for the Sports Festival
Cheerleading Squad?

00:16:09.135 --> 00:16:11.262 position:50% align:center
[TEACHER 9A]
Don't all jump at once.

00:16:11.346 --> 00:16:12.931 position:50% align:center
Ah, come on, guys.

00:16:13.014 --> 00:16:16.810 position:50% align:center
[YU ] Then I did the unthinkable
and became cheerleader myself.

00:16:16.893 --> 00:16:19.813 position:50% align:center
That would be my ticket
to becoming a normie.

00:16:19.896 --> 00:16:22.232 position:50% align:center
Are we gonna win, or what?

00:16:22.315 --> 00:16:23.441 position:50% align:center
Yeah!

00:16:23.525 --> 00:16:25.235 position:50% align:center
[CHEERLEADING SQUAD]
Yeah!

00:16:25.318 --> 00:16:27.779 position:50% align:center
[YU] My logic was
flawed to say the least.

00:16:27.862 --> 00:16:29.572 position:50% align:center
It's not that joining
the Cheerleading Squad

00:16:29.656 --> 00:16:30.907 position:50% align:center
will make you a normie,

00:16:30.990 --> 00:16:33.868 position:50% align:center
but that only normies join
the Cheerleading Squad.

00:16:33.952 --> 00:16:36.204 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR]
The Yay Brigade!

00:16:36.287 --> 00:16:39.457 position:50% align:center
They yell "Yay" at every
opportunity, party nonstop,

00:16:39.541 --> 00:16:41.626 position:50% align:center
and wear the trendiest
clothes around.

00:16:41.710 --> 00:16:42.961 position:50% align:center
So you gotta wonder

00:16:43.044 --> 00:16:46.297 position:50% align:center
what a guy like Ishigami
is doing with these kids.

00:16:46.381 --> 00:16:50.343 position:50% align:center
[YU] I made a terrible decision
in a moment of doubt. Damn it.

00:16:50.427 --> 00:16:51.970 position:50% align:center
I don't even need
to turn my head.

00:16:52.053 --> 00:16:55.181 position:50% align:center
I can sense Onodera is
staring at me like I'm nuts.

00:16:55.265 --> 00:16:56.683 position:50% align:center
Figured I'd be the leader.

00:16:56.766 --> 00:16:59.477 position:50% align:center
And then Koyasu here could
be my second in command.

00:16:59.561 --> 00:17:01.021 position:50% align:center
Is that okay?

00:17:01.104 --> 00:17:04.065 position:50% align:center
[CHEERLEADERS] You bet! Sounds
like a totally rockin' time!

00:17:04.149 --> 00:17:06.067 position:50% align:center
[YU] That was the fastest
election ever.

00:17:06.151 --> 00:17:07.902 position:50% align:center
Our first order of
business is deciding

00:17:07.986 --> 00:17:09.946 position:50% align:center
what Team Red's slogan will be.

00:17:10.030 --> 00:17:11.990 position:50% align:center
So then, whatcha got for me?

00:17:12.073 --> 00:17:14.743 position:50% align:center
[CHEERLEADER 9A]
Well, I have an idea!

00:17:14.826 --> 00:17:16.578 position:50% align:center
[CHEERLEADERS chattering]

00:17:16.661 --> 00:17:19.789 position:50% align:center
[YU] Huh... So that's
the way they do things.

00:17:19.873 --> 00:17:22.417 position:50% align:center
Guess that means I won't
be contributing anything.

00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:25.837 position:50% align:center
I wonder why they even bother
using a room with desks.

00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:27.005 position:50% align:center
[KOYASU]
All righty!

00:17:27.088 --> 00:17:28.798 position:50% align:center
We've narrowed it down
to three choices!

00:17:28.882 --> 00:17:29.883 position:50% align:center
[KAZENO]
They all suck.

00:17:29.966 --> 00:17:31.634 position:50% align:center
You can't hashtag
"instagrammable."

00:17:31.718 --> 00:17:33.470 position:50% align:center
[CHEERLEADERS squabbling]

00:17:33.553 --> 00:17:35.597 position:50% align:center
[YU] The only thing you
people enjoy photographing

00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:37.015 position:50% align:center
more than yourselves

00:17:37.098 --> 00:17:39.142 position:50% align:center
are your friggin' pancakes
when it's your cheat day!

00:17:39.225 --> 00:17:42.896 position:50% align:center
[KAZENO ] In that case,
why don't we do... this?

00:17:42.979 --> 00:17:43.980 position:50% align:center
[CHEERLEADER 9A]
You made it even worse!

00:17:44.064 --> 00:17:46.274 position:50% align:center
[CHEERLEADERS squabbling]

00:17:46.358 --> 00:17:47.400 position:50% align:center
That's a definite yes!

00:17:47.484 --> 00:17:48.860 position:50% align:center
[YU]
You mean a hard no!

00:17:48.943 --> 00:17:50.028 position:50% align:center
[KAZENO ]
Gotta look sharp...

00:17:50.111 --> 00:17:51.112 position:50% align:center
[YU] But it's hard
to tell them something

00:17:51.196 --> 00:17:55.033 position:50% align:center
sounds dumb when
their grades are better.

00:17:55.116 --> 00:17:57.869 position:50% align:center
Aw, man. Our latest
stories are gonna go viral!

00:17:57.952 --> 00:18:00.455 position:50% align:center
[CHEERLEADER 9B] I think our
work's done here for today!

00:18:00.538 --> 00:18:02.248 position:50% align:center
[YU] Are they still
speaking the same language?

00:18:02.332 --> 00:18:04.376 position:50% align:center
[KOYASU] We should make
a group for this on Line!

00:18:04.459 --> 00:18:06.961 position:50% align:center
[YU] Great idea. Use
the app I don't have.

00:18:07.045 --> 00:18:08.004 position:50% align:center

If I'm not mistaken, your
name's Yu, isn't it? [giggles]

00:18:14.386 --> 00:18:16.221 position:50% align:center
What's the best
way to reach you?

00:18:16.304 --> 00:18:17.681 position:50% align:center
What's your email address?

00:18:17.764 --> 00:18:20.183 position:50% align:center
I'll just use it to send
you what's important.

00:18:20.266 --> 00:18:22.435 position:50% align:center
It's really nice of you to
go through all that trouble.

[KAZENO]
So!

00:18:24.312 --> 00:18:26.564 position:50% align:center
For those of you wondering
what we'll be wearing,

00:18:26.648 --> 00:18:28.316 position:50% align:center
the girls will dress
in boys' school uniforms,

00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:29.693 position:50% align:center
and the boys in
the girls' dresses!

00:18:29.776 --> 00:18:31.194 position:50% align:center
[CHEERLEADERS
cheering, chattering]

00:18:31.277 --> 00:18:33.446 position:50% align:center
Now get out there and
find a uniform to borrow!

[CHEERLEADER 9E]
This is sick!

00:18:36.825 --> 00:18:38.493 position:50% align:center
[YU]
Huh?

00:18:39.828 --> 00:18:41.788 position:50% align:center
[YU]
I must be in Hell.

00:18:41.871 --> 00:18:44.708 position:50% align:center
And they're demons
who've already adapted.

00:18:44.791 --> 00:18:46.751 position:50% align:center
Those other guys have
tons of female friends

00:18:46.835 --> 00:18:48.837 position:50% align:center
they could swap uniforms with,

00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:50.672 position:50% align:center
whereas I've been
blessed with the ability

00:18:50.755 --> 00:18:53.258 position:50% align:center
to repel the opposite sex.

00:18:53.341 --> 00:18:55.218 position:50% align:center
If I asked any of
the girls in my class

00:18:55.301 --> 00:18:58.847 position:50% align:center
to let me borrow their uniform,
they'd freak the frick out.

00:18:58.930 --> 00:19:02.350 position:50% align:center
Then, there are my fellow
Student Council members.

00:19:02.434 --> 00:19:03.893 position:50% align:center
Iino'd say...

00:19:03.977 --> 00:19:06.604 position:50% align:center
[BOTH] Forget it, you sicko!
I'd have to burn it afterwards!

00:19:06.688 --> 00:19:09.941 position:50% align:center
[YU] I'm sure Fujiwara would be
my best bet, but even so,

00:19:10.025 --> 00:19:11.526 position:50% align:center
[BOTH] Hey, you're gonna do
something weird with it,

00:19:11.609 --> 00:19:12.402 position:50% align:center
I just know it!

00:19:12.485 --> 00:19:14.029 position:50% align:center
[YU groans]

00:19:14.112 --> 00:19:15.363 position:50% align:center
[YU] Even when I'm
completely innocent,

00:19:15.447 --> 00:19:17.615 position:50% align:center
she thinks I have
my mind in the gutter.

00:19:17.699 --> 00:19:19.701 position:50% align:center
There are times where she's
right about that, though.

00:19:19.784 --> 00:19:21.870 position:50% align:center
And that just leaves Shinomiya.

00:19:21.953 --> 00:19:23.455 position:50% align:center
And I'm too afraid
of her to even ask.

00:19:23.538 --> 00:19:25.123 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA] Did I hear you
say my name just now?

00:19:25.206 --> 00:19:26.458 position:50% align:center
[YU gasps]
Oh, crap!

00:19:26.541 --> 00:19:27.876 position:50% align:center
I'm so sorry!

00:19:27.959 --> 00:19:29.836 position:50% align:center
Where do you think you're going?

00:19:32.005 --> 00:19:35.383 position:50% align:center
[YU] Bottom line is...
I have no one I can borrow from.

00:19:35.467 --> 00:19:37.552 position:50% align:center
This cheerleading squad
isn't working out at all,

00:19:37.635 --> 00:19:39.262 position:50% align:center
so maybe I should just quit.

00:19:39.346 --> 00:19:41.306 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA] Oh. Well,
if you really need it,

00:19:41.389 --> 00:19:43.308 position:50% align:center
I would be willing
to lend you my uniform.

00:19:43.391 --> 00:19:45.143 position:50% align:center
[YU grunts]
Seriously?

00:19:45.226 --> 00:19:46.644 position:50% align:center
Why not?

00:19:46.728 --> 00:19:49.356 position:50% align:center
I'll be wearing your clothes.
And you're okay with that?

00:19:49.439 --> 00:19:52.192 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA sighs] Well, you're
my fellow council member

00:19:52.275 --> 00:19:55.403 position:50% align:center
and you're in a pinch, so yes.

00:19:55.487 --> 00:19:58.990 position:50% align:center
You're total-ly... crazy-haa...

00:19:59.074 --> 00:20:00.992 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA] I don't believe I'm
familiar with that phrase.

00:20:01.076 --> 00:20:03.703 position:50% align:center
Probably for the best.

00:20:03.787 --> 00:20:06.164 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA]
My waist is fairly slim,

00:20:06.247 --> 00:20:08.333 position:50% align:center
so I don't know
if it'll fit you.

00:20:08.416 --> 00:20:10.293 position:50% align:center
Do you wanna try
it on now or later?

00:20:10.377 --> 00:20:12.212 position:50% align:center
[YU] Now, if that's cool.

00:20:12.295 --> 00:20:14.673 position:50% align:center
Uh! You mean in here?

00:20:14.756 --> 00:20:17.217 position:50% align:center
I can wait outside
if you're bashful.

00:20:17.300 --> 00:20:19.511 position:50% align:center
Nah. I don't mind.

00:20:21.179 --> 00:20:24.516 position:50% align:center
[YU] Shinomiya wore this
very uniform on this very day.

00:20:24.599 --> 00:20:27.310 position:50% align:center
And I'm about to wear
it in front of her.

00:20:27.394 --> 00:20:31.147 position:50% align:center
[YU squeals] This could
awaken something inside me!

00:20:45.745 --> 00:20:48.581 position:50% align:center
[YU]
It fits, more or less.

00:20:48.665 --> 00:20:50.709 position:50% align:center
And kind of looks cute on you.

00:20:50.792 --> 00:20:53.628 position:50% align:center
Hmm... [giggles]

00:20:53.712 --> 00:20:55.130 position:50% align:center
Since you're halfway there,

00:20:55.213 --> 00:20:58.299 position:50% align:center
what do you say that we
put makeup on you, too?

00:20:58.383 --> 00:21:01.386 position:50% align:center
[YU] You wear makeup?
I guess I never noticed.

00:21:01.469 --> 00:21:02.762 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA]
Not usually,

00:21:02.846 --> 00:21:05.015 position:50% align:center
but I pay attention when
I have people do it for me.

00:21:06.725 --> 00:21:07.517 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:09.269 position:50% align:center
Are you having second thoughts?

00:21:09.352 --> 00:21:11.813 position:50% align:center
Oh, no. I'm good.

00:21:14.024 --> 00:21:17.027 position:50% align:center
[YU] Wasn't expecting to have my
drag debut today.

00:21:17.110 --> 00:21:19.988 position:50% align:center
What if I really get
mistaken for a girl?

00:21:20.071 --> 00:21:21.197 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA]
By the way,

00:21:21.281 --> 00:21:23.241 position:50% align:center
is the waist comfortable
or is it too tight?

00:21:23.324 --> 00:21:25.910 position:50% align:center
[YU] No. That part
feels fine, actually.

00:21:25.994 --> 00:21:27.579 position:50% align:center
Oh, good. Glad it worked out.

00:21:27.662 --> 00:21:30.457 position:50% align:center
[YU] In fact, the only place it
feels snug is the chest area.

00:21:30.540 --> 00:21:32.167 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA grunts]

00:21:32.250 --> 00:21:34.502 position:50% align:center
Fun little fact is that
I did sports in junior high,

00:21:34.586 --> 00:21:36.629 position:50% align:center
so my pecs are kinda ripped.

00:21:36.713 --> 00:21:38.757 position:50% align:center
I hope I didn't
stretch it out too much.

00:21:38.840 --> 00:21:41.843 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA] That's fine.
Don't worry about it.

00:21:41.926 --> 00:21:46.097 position:50% align:center
[YU]
Wow. Shinomiya's so nice.

00:21:48.475 --> 00:21:49.476 position:50% align:center
It's so you.

00:21:49.559 --> 00:21:50.602 position:50% align:center
See for yourself!

00:21:50.685 --> 00:21:52.437 position:50% align:center
[YU gasps]

00:21:52.520 --> 00:21:54.189 position:50% align:center
[YU]
I trusted you with my face!

00:21:54.272 --> 00:21:56.649 position:50% align:center
You chose the ultimate betrayal.

00:21:56.733 --> 00:22:00.737 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA giggles] I'm sorry.
I'll fix it for you right away.

00:22:00.820 --> 00:22:03.073 position:50% align:center
[YU]
Do you have to giggle about it?

00:22:03.156 --> 00:22:04.574 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA]
Hard not to.

00:22:04.657 --> 00:22:06.326 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI] It's fine that she's
being affectionate toward

00:22:06.409 --> 00:22:09.579 position:50% align:center
a fellow student council member,
but they're sitting so close!

00:22:09.662 --> 00:22:12.916 position:50% align:center
I'm not jealous,
just making an observation.

00:22:12.999 --> 00:22:13.750 position:50% align:center
[phone buzzes]

00:22:13.833 --> 00:22:16.211 position:50% align:center
Uhh... 'Scuse me for a sec.

00:22:22.509 --> 00:22:24.177 position:50% align:center
[YU grunts]
Well...

00:22:24.260 --> 00:22:26.221 position:50% align:center
Maybe I'll give it
a shot after all.

00:22:26.304 --> 00:22:29.182 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR] That day, Yu
Ishigami became a cheerleader.

00:22:29.265 --> 00:22:30.850 position:50% align:center
His story continues in

00:22:30.934 --> 00:22:35.397 position:50% align:center
"Victory and Defeat at
the Sports Festival."

00:22:35.480 --> 00:22:37.816 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA] Can I put
a ribbon on you? Please?

00:22:37.899 --> 00:22:40.026 position:50% align:center
[YU] If you're trying to stir
something within me,

00:22:40.110 --> 00:22:41.945 position:50% align:center
you're doing a good job.
