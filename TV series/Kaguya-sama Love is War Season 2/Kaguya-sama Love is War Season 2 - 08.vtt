[NARRATOR]
Student Council, assemble!

00:01:45.146 --> 00:01:48.149 position:50% align:center
Former members have reprised
their previous positions.

00:01:48.233 --> 00:01:49.901 position:50% align:center
Miko Iino has joined as well,

00:01:49.984 --> 00:01:51.945 position:50% align:center
taking on the role
of financial auditor.

00:01:52.028 --> 00:01:55.699 position:50% align:center
One might assume that
this team is unstoppable!

00:01:55.782 --> 00:01:58.535 position:50% align:center
But one would be
very, very, wrong.

00:01:58.618 --> 00:02:00.829 position:50% align:center
[MIKO] You break school
regulations left and right.

00:02:00.912 --> 00:02:02.664 position:50% align:center
While you two commit
unspeakable acts

00:02:02.747 --> 00:02:04.332 position:50% align:center
in the very room
we're standing in!

00:02:04.416 --> 00:02:06.459 position:50% align:center
It's disgraceful!
Do you even realize

00:02:06.543 --> 00:02:10.130 position:50% align:center
you're respected representatives
of this academy?!

00:02:10.213 --> 00:02:12.716 position:50% align:center
Your secretary could
teach you all a thing or two!

00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:14.551 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA, MIYUKI, YU]
Uhh...

00:02:14.634 --> 00:02:17.595 position:50% align:center
[YU] She breaks school rules.
[coughs] <i>Go Sweet</i> .

00:02:17.679 --> 00:02:19.472 position:50% align:center
It's <i>Go Sweet</i> !

00:02:19.556 --> 00:02:21.516 position:50% align:center
Artists like Fujiwara
get a special pass

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:24.394 position:50% align:center
because creative outlets can
help develop their skillsets.

00:02:24.477 --> 00:02:26.021 position:50% align:center
Why is she the one exception?

00:02:26.104 --> 00:02:29.441 position:50% align:center
Anyway! The one who brought
the manga here is the president!

00:02:29.524 --> 00:02:31.276 position:50% align:center
You should be setting
a good example for everyone,

00:02:31.359 --> 00:02:33.862 position:50% align:center
but you're so
undisciplined! Do better!

00:02:33.945 --> 00:02:35.280 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI groans]

00:02:35.363 --> 00:02:38.241 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA]
Iino, a word?

00:02:38.324 --> 00:02:39.701 position:50% align:center
You're only a first-year,

00:02:39.784 --> 00:02:41.786 position:50% align:center
so you may not understand
how the president operates.

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:43.163 position:50% align:center
But one thing he does faithfully

00:02:43.246 --> 00:02:45.582 position:50% align:center
is set a proper
precedent for us.

00:02:45.665 --> 00:02:47.792 position:50% align:center
I'd appreciate it if
you stopped judging him.

00:02:47.876 --> 00:02:49.669 position:50% align:center
Does this "proper precedent"
you're referring to

00:02:49.753 --> 00:02:51.796 position:50% align:center
include what I caught you
two doing in the office?

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:54.299 position:50% align:center
That exemplifies stupidity,
not good behavior.

00:02:54.382 --> 00:02:56.301 position:50% align:center
Iino, you misunderstood.

00:02:56.384 --> 00:02:58.386 position:50% align:center
I get that you like
each other a lot,

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:00.180 position:50% align:center
but that doesn't mean
that we need to see!

00:03:00.263 --> 00:03:02.932 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA gasps]
You think we like each other?

00:03:03.016 --> 00:03:05.143 position:50% align:center
Wow. Who knew we
came across that way?

00:03:05.226 --> 00:03:07.937 position:50% align:center
Everyone because you're
letting it get the best of you!

00:03:08.021 --> 00:03:10.023 position:50% align:center
I wonder how far love can go.

00:03:10.106 --> 00:03:11.649 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA]
She's such a sweetheart!

00:03:11.733 --> 00:03:14.402 position:50% align:center
[MIKO] Bottom line, the next
time one of you misbehaves,

00:03:14.486 --> 00:03:16.071 position:50% align:center
I'm using my
authority as a member of

00:03:16.154 --> 00:03:18.531 position:50% align:center
the Disciplinary Committee
to put you in your place!

00:03:18.615 --> 00:03:19.783 position:50% align:center
You know...

00:03:19.866 --> 00:03:22.660 position:50% align:center
...you catch more flies
with honey than vinegar.

00:03:22.744 --> 00:03:25.163 position:50% align:center
I don't care if you're a
stickler for the rules or what.

00:03:25.246 --> 00:03:27.123 position:50% align:center
You need to grasp the
concept that the people

00:03:27.207 --> 00:03:29.501 position:50% align:center
you're cracking down on
have feelings, too.

00:03:29.584 --> 00:03:30.585 position:50% align:center
You should try
being more empathetic

00:03:30.669 --> 00:03:31.753 position:50% align:center
and listen to
what they have to--

00:03:31.836 --> 00:03:34.506 position:50% align:center
Shut up. Don't tell
me what to do, okay?

00:03:34.589 --> 00:03:36.216 position:50% align:center
[YU groans]

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:37.842 position:50% align:center
[CHIKA] You can't expect
the people you scold

00:03:37.926 --> 00:03:40.178 position:50% align:center
to listen to you if
you won't listen to them.

00:03:40.261 --> 00:03:43.431 position:50% align:center
They have feelings
just like you and I do!

00:03:43.515 --> 00:03:46.476 position:50% align:center
Yes. I suppose so.

00:03:46.559 --> 00:03:49.771 position:50% align:center
[YU] I was saying
the same exact thing.

00:03:49.854 --> 00:03:52.982 position:50% align:center
You can be strict.
Or you can be soft!

00:03:53.066 --> 00:03:56.111 position:50% align:center
Balancing both of those is key
when you're lecturing people!

00:03:56.194 --> 00:03:57.362 position:50% align:center
Ah. I see.

00:03:57.445 --> 00:03:59.364 position:50% align:center
Hey, I know!
To practice being nice,

00:03:59.447 --> 00:04:01.199 position:50% align:center
you're officially not
allowed to get angry

00:04:01.282 --> 00:04:03.451 position:50% align:center
for the next 60 minutes!

00:04:03.535 --> 00:04:04.911 position:50% align:center
Uh, you think that'll help?

00:04:04.994 --> 00:04:06.329 position:50% align:center
[CHIKA]
Abso-tutu-lutely!

00:04:06.413 --> 00:04:07.872 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI] Is she her junior
classmate or a plaything?

00:04:07.956 --> 00:04:09.290 position:50% align:center
Judging from
the look on her face,

00:04:09.374 --> 00:04:11.751 position:50% align:center
I'm going to say it's
the latter of the two.

00:04:11.835 --> 00:04:15.547 position:50% align:center
If you really think it's
a good idea, then I'll try it.

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:17.132 position:50% align:center
Hah! Ya hear that?

00:04:17.215 --> 00:04:18.383 position:50% align:center
You can do whatever
the heck you want,

00:04:18.466 --> 00:04:20.051 position:50% align:center
and she won't get on your case!

00:04:20.135 --> 00:04:21.928 position:50% align:center
[YU]
Really?

00:04:22.012 --> 00:04:24.222 position:50% align:center
As if it matters either way.

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:31.146 position:50% align:center
Doing what I want when I
want is what I usually do.

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:32.897 position:50% align:center
Oh, no! His foot!

00:04:32.981 --> 00:04:35.066 position:50% align:center
Try to contain
yourself and be calm.

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:37.027 position:50% align:center
Keep a nice and level head.

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:39.738 position:50% align:center
[CHIKA gasps] What's he
digging in his bag for?

00:04:40.864 --> 00:04:43.324 position:50% align:center
[MIKO]
It's soda and chips!

00:04:45.827 --> 00:04:46.828 position:50% align:center
[CHIKA]
He wasn't kidding when he said

00:04:46.911 --> 00:04:48.329 position:50% align:center
he does what he
wants when he wants!

00:04:48.413 --> 00:04:50.290 position:50% align:center
Just look at that
rebellious feast!

00:04:50.373 --> 00:04:54.002 position:50% align:center
[video game beeping]

00:04:54.085 --> 00:04:56.588 position:50% align:center
[CHIKA]
Now he's playing a videogame?!

00:05:00.342 --> 00:05:02.844 position:50% align:center
[MIKO]
He hooked it up to the TV!

00:05:02.927 --> 00:05:04.596 position:50% align:center
[CHIKA]
You can't get mad!

00:05:04.679 --> 00:05:05.764 position:50% align:center
He's testing you!

00:05:05.847 --> 00:05:08.350 position:50% align:center
Not getting mad is
only making me madder!

00:05:08.433 --> 00:05:10.977 position:50% align:center
[CHIKA]
Ah, in that case...

00:05:11.061 --> 00:05:12.437 position:50% align:center
For the next part
of your training,

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:14.397 position:50% align:center
you should break
a school rule as well!

00:05:14.481 --> 00:05:15.732 position:50% align:center
[MIKO gasps]

00:05:15.815 --> 00:05:17.609 position:50% align:center
[CHIKA] Academy guidelines
state we can use phones

00:05:17.692 --> 00:05:19.736 position:50% align:center
to make important calls
or look something up,

00:05:19.819 --> 00:05:21.613 position:50% align:center
but we can't use apps
or social media

00:05:21.696 --> 00:05:23.907 position:50% align:center
other than for studying
while we're on campus, right?

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:24.824 position:50% align:center
Right...

00:05:24.908 --> 00:05:28.119 position:50% align:center
'Kay, just a sec. [giggles]

00:05:28.203 --> 00:05:30.538 position:50% align:center
There! It's your turn now!

00:05:30.622 --> 00:05:33.792 position:50% align:center
We can decorate them
and post 'em online!

00:05:33.875 --> 00:05:35.960 position:50% align:center
[MIKO]
Using those kinds of apps

00:05:36.044 --> 00:05:38.296 position:50% align:center
would definitely
be a first for me.

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:39.923 position:50% align:center
If you wanna know
how rule-breakers feel,

00:05:40.006 --> 00:05:41.591 position:50% align:center
then you'll have to
break some rules, too!

00:05:41.675 --> 00:05:42.926 position:50% align:center
Let's do it!

00:05:43.009 --> 00:05:44.928 position:50% align:center
It's just a few pictures!

00:05:45.011 --> 00:05:47.222 position:50% align:center
[MIKO]
If you insist, Fujiwara.

00:05:47.305 --> 00:05:49.140 position:50% align:center
So which one is the president?

00:05:49.224 --> 00:05:51.142 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI] The one in
the pointy green hat.

00:05:52.185 --> 00:05:55.105 position:50% align:center
[CHIKA giggling]
You're adorable, Miko!

00:05:55.188 --> 00:05:57.107 position:50% align:center
Wait till you see these!

00:05:57.190 --> 00:06:00.235 position:50% align:center
Now tilt your head up
and look this way!

00:06:00.318 --> 00:06:02.696 position:50% align:center
Dead! It's pure criminal!

00:06:02.779 --> 00:06:05.615 position:50% align:center
Cuteness overload,
girl! [grunting]

00:06:05.699 --> 00:06:07.325 position:50% align:center
That was one cheap shot, punk.

00:06:07.409 --> 00:06:09.327 position:50% align:center
[YU]
Sucks to suck.

00:06:09.411 --> 00:06:11.413 position:50% align:center
Hey! Let's get
a shot of all the girls!

00:06:11.496 --> 00:06:13.206 position:50% align:center
That includes you, Kaguya!

00:06:13.289 --> 00:06:15.458 position:50% align:center
Um, thanks, but
I'm gonna pass this time.

00:06:15.542 --> 00:06:16.751 position:50% align:center
[CHIKA]
Don't be a party pooper!

00:06:16.835 --> 00:06:18.003 position:50% align:center
Uh!

00:06:19.504 --> 00:06:22.340 position:50% align:center
[CHIKA]
Perfect! Say cheese!

00:06:25.301 --> 00:06:27.846 position:50% align:center
[CHIKA]
Feels like something's missing.

00:06:27.929 --> 00:06:31.933 position:50% align:center
I know! Make weird faces
this time around, okay?

00:06:32.017 --> 00:06:33.977 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA, MIKO]
Did you say weird?

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:36.187 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA] I can't do that
with the president watching!

00:06:36.271 --> 00:06:37.272 position:50% align:center
A banana!

00:06:37.355 --> 00:06:38.732 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA]
Hey, why aren't you watching?!

00:06:38.815 --> 00:06:40.525 position:50% align:center
Wah!

00:06:40.608 --> 00:06:42.444 position:50% align:center

[CHIKA blows raspberry]
Are you two like models

00:06:48.408 --> 00:06:50.076 position:50% align:center
who are afraid to
be anything but cute?

[BOTH grunt]

00:06:50.994 --> 00:06:52.537 position:50% align:center
A weird face is like...

...this one! You get it now?

00:06:54.622 --> 00:06:56.124 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA]
Nope, not happening!

00:06:56.207 --> 00:06:58.376 position:50% align:center
There. Am I doing it right?

00:06:58.460 --> 00:06:59.669 position:50% align:center

That's cute!

[KAGUYA gasps]
How is it cute?

00:07:01.921 --> 00:07:03.673 position:50% align:center
Then again, if I
squint hard enough,

00:07:03.757 --> 00:07:05.800 position:50% align:center
I can't say she's not cute.

00:07:08.428 --> 00:07:09.721 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA]
I know how out of touch I am

00:07:09.804 --> 00:07:12.140 position:50% align:center
with what's popular
among the youth these days.

00:07:12.223 --> 00:07:13.224 position:50% align:center
But, really?

00:07:13.308 --> 00:07:15.977 position:50% align:center
This is what "cute"
has evolved to?

00:07:16.061 --> 00:07:17.312 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA]
Like this?

Oh, yeah!

00:07:19.814 --> 00:07:21.107 position:50% align:center
You thought it was cute?

00:07:21.191 --> 00:07:22.442 position:50% align:center
[CHIKA]
Super cute!

00:07:22.525 --> 00:07:23.610 position:50% align:center
Really?

00:07:23.693 --> 00:07:24.903 position:50% align:center
[CHIKA] Yes! It's, like,
the second cutest

00:07:24.986 --> 00:07:26.905 position:50% align:center
I've ever seen you!

00:07:26.988 --> 00:07:29.240 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA] Wow, that's
pretty cute, all right.

00:07:29.324 --> 00:07:30.950 position:50% align:center
And Fujiwara's not the type
who would lie about that stuff.

00:07:31.034 --> 00:07:32.535 position:50% align:center
 ...so ugly, that
it's actually cute!

00:12:38.425 --> 00:12:42.012 position:50% align:center

You scumbag!

misunderstanding again!

Everything about this sucks!

Take a look at this, Kaguya!

[KAGUYA]
What is it?

00:15:27.719 --> 00:15:28.678 position:50% align:center
Shinomiya.

00:15:28.762 --> 00:15:29.721 position:50% align:center
Uh?

00:15:29.804 --> 00:15:31.806 position:50% align:center
You've got something
in your hair.

00:15:31.890 --> 00:15:36.561 position:50% align:center
Uh, what? Where?

00:15:36.644 --> 00:15:38.229 position:50% align:center
Allow me.

00:15:43.401 --> 00:15:45.612 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA]
Oh, so I did.

00:15:45.695 --> 00:15:48.740 position:50% align:center
Pretty absentminded
of me not to notice, huh?

00:15:48.823 --> 00:15:52.327 position:50% align:center
Recently, I've kind of been...

00:15:52.410 --> 00:15:53.870 position:50% align:center

Shinomiya!

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:00.585 position:50% align:center

Someone call for an ambulance!

Oh! Right!

00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:13.848 position:50% align:center
[CHIKA]
You know, Kaguya has never

00:16:13.932 --> 00:16:17.143 position:50% align:center
had a very strong
constitution to begin with.

00:16:17.227 --> 00:16:19.270 position:50% align:center
She gets sick every
time the seasons change

00:16:19.354 --> 00:16:21.481 position:50% align:center
and has to take
time off from school.

00:16:21.564 --> 00:16:25.360 position:50% align:center
If I'm not mistaken, her mother
passed away from heart disease.

00:16:25.443 --> 00:16:27.112 position:50% align:center
I never knew.

Your attention, please.

00:16:37.789 --> 00:16:40.417 position:50% align:center
Doctor Tanuma is
making his rounds.

00:16:43.336 --> 00:16:44.963 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR]
Shozo Tanuma.

00:16:45.046 --> 00:16:47.674 position:50% align:center
Considered to be one of
the world's top ten doctors,

00:16:47.757 --> 00:16:50.468 position:50% align:center
he's a master cardiologist
and the leading expert on

00:16:50.552 --> 00:16:53.513 position:50% align:center
pediatric cardiac
bypass surgery.

00:16:53.596 --> 00:16:54.681 position:50% align:center
His patients include

00:16:54.764 --> 00:16:57.267 position:50% align:center
some of the most
important people in Japan,

00:16:57.350 --> 00:17:00.687 position:50% align:center
such as the prime minister and
members of the Shinomiya family.

00:17:00.770 --> 00:17:02.272 position:50% align:center
Doctor.

00:17:04.107 --> 00:17:06.818 position:50% align:center
What? Did you say
the Shinomiya girl?

00:17:08.153 --> 00:17:09.612 position:50% align:center
I'm on my way.

00:17:09.696 --> 00:17:12.407 position:50% align:center
But, sir, you were asked to
attend the governor's party.

00:17:12.490 --> 00:17:14.617 position:50% align:center
[TANUMA]
They can wait.

00:17:14.701 --> 00:17:15.994 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR]
In that moment,

00:17:16.077 --> 00:17:19.873 position:50% align:center
Shozo Tanuma recalls
a vivid memory from the past.

00:17:21.583 --> 00:17:24.586 position:50% align:center
[TANUMA] She was a girl who
didn't look forward to anything,

00:17:24.669 --> 00:17:28.048 position:50% align:center
with eyes as red as fire,
yet cold as ice.

00:17:28.131 --> 00:17:30.508 position:50% align:center
Apparently...

00:17:30.592 --> 00:17:33.219 position:50% align:center
...what goes around
comes around.

00:17:36.681 --> 00:17:39.809 position:50% align:center
If I had to guess,
I'd say it's arrhythmia.

00:17:39.893 --> 00:17:42.520 position:50% align:center
My heart started beating
fast out of nowhere.

00:17:42.604 --> 00:17:45.190 position:50% align:center
Then, I felt a pain in
my chest that was so bad,

00:17:45.273 --> 00:17:47.400 position:50% align:center
I thought I was going to die.

00:17:47.484 --> 00:17:50.945 position:50% align:center
Does that sound like
any disease you know of?

00:17:51.029 --> 00:17:52.447 position:50% align:center
Well...

00:17:52.530 --> 00:17:53.656 position:50% align:center
Going by what you've told me,

00:17:53.740 --> 00:17:57.118 position:50% align:center
I have a pretty good
idea of what it is.

00:17:57.202 --> 00:17:58.745 position:50% align:center
Please don't panic.

00:17:58.828 --> 00:18:01.664 position:50% align:center
Just listen to
what I have to say.

00:18:01.748 --> 00:18:03.708 position:50% align:center
All right.

00:18:03.792 --> 00:18:07.420 position:50% align:center
You are what's
known as "lovesick."

00:18:07.504 --> 00:18:09.047 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA]
Uh...

00:18:10.590 --> 00:18:13.760 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA] Um, is that a
trendy name for some kind of

00:18:13.843 --> 00:18:15.345 position:50% align:center
heart disease I'm unaware of?

00:18:15.428 --> 00:18:16.846 position:50% align:center
[TANUMA]
No, what I'm referring to

00:18:16.930 --> 00:18:19.182 position:50% align:center
is the emotion you feel
when you're in love.

00:18:19.265 --> 00:18:22.227 position:50% align:center
Good one, Doctor. You really had
me going there for a minute.

00:18:22.310 --> 00:18:24.104 position:50% align:center
I'm not joking with you, though.

00:18:24.187 --> 00:18:26.064 position:50% align:center
So what you're saying is
I collapsed and was taken

00:18:26.147 --> 00:18:28.983 position:50% align:center
to a hospital in an ambulance
all because I'm in love?!

00:18:29.067 --> 00:18:31.194 position:50% align:center
Yes. I was a bit
disturbed as well at first

00:18:31.277 --> 00:18:32.821 position:50% align:center
because this is unprecedented.

00:18:32.904 --> 00:18:34.572 position:50% align:center
That's just utterly ridiculous!

00:18:34.656 --> 00:18:36.533 position:50% align:center
Someone else may well be in
love with me, but you can

00:18:36.616 --> 00:18:39.411 position:50% align:center
rest assured that I'd never
do anything so idiotic!

00:18:39.494 --> 00:18:41.454 position:50% align:center
[TANUMA] She's a bit of a
firecracker, am I right?

00:18:41.538 --> 00:18:44.499 position:50% align:center
The kids call it
" <i>tsundere</i> ," sir.

00:18:44.582 --> 00:18:47.252 position:50% align:center
Is my personality
a disease, too?!

00:18:47.335 --> 00:18:49.379 position:50% align:center
[TANUMA] Let's review
your symptoms, shall we?

00:18:49.462 --> 00:18:52.007 position:50% align:center
Earlier you told me that
your heart starts beating fast

00:18:52.090 --> 00:18:53.258 position:50% align:center
when you think
of certain someone

00:18:53.341 --> 00:18:54.509 position:50% align:center
during school activities.

00:18:54.592 --> 00:18:55.885 position:50% align:center
Yes. That's correct!

00:18:55.969 --> 00:18:57.679 position:50% align:center
é\And today,
that same certain someone

00:18:57.762 --> 00:18:59.806 position:50% align:center
removed a piece of
lint from your hair.

00:18:59.889 --> 00:19:02.058 position:50% align:center
When his hand brushed
your cheek ever so slightly,

00:19:02.142 --> 00:19:04.853 position:50% align:center
you began experiencing a
pulsating pain in your chest,

00:19:04.936 --> 00:19:06.688 position:50% align:center
not to mention
shortness of breath.

00:19:06.771 --> 00:19:09.190 position:50% align:center
Why are you repeating
what I just told you?!

00:19:10.692 --> 00:19:12.485 position:50% align:center
I'm afraid...

00:19:12.569 --> 00:19:13.403 position:50% align:center
...you're in love.

00:19:13.486 --> 00:19:15.530 position:50% align:center
You could not be more wrong!

00:19:15.613 --> 00:19:17.490 position:50% align:center
It's gotta be some
kind of a heart disease!

00:19:17.574 --> 00:19:19.701 position:50% align:center
These symptoms never
showed till now!

00:19:19.784 --> 00:19:21.161 position:50% align:center
[TANUMA]
Then, it's your first love.

00:19:21.244 --> 00:19:22.912 position:50% align:center
[HAYASAKA]
Lady Kaguya?

00:19:22.996 --> 00:19:24.289 position:50% align:center
I'm going to wait outside,

00:19:24.372 --> 00:19:26.041 position:50% align:center
so why don't you just call me
when you're done here?

00:19:26.124 --> 00:19:27.625 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA]
You're leaving me?!

00:19:27.709 --> 00:19:30.837 position:50% align:center
[HAYASAKA] This was my hospital,
too, but after this humiliation,

00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:32.630 position:50% align:center
I don't think
I can ever come back.

00:19:32.714 --> 00:19:34.632 position:50% align:center
What are you talking about?

00:19:34.716 --> 00:19:37.886 position:50% align:center
Anyway, I would like
a proper exam, please.

00:19:42.098 --> 00:19:45.685 position:50% align:center
[TANUMA] This is our latest and
greatest medical testing device.

00:19:45.769 --> 00:19:47.312 position:50% align:center
Since it's state-of-the-art
technology,

00:19:47.395 --> 00:19:49.272 position:50% align:center
the fee to use
it is rather steep.

00:19:49.356 --> 00:19:50.565 position:50% align:center
But you'll still proceed?

00:19:50.648 --> 00:19:52.400 position:50% align:center
You can't put a price
on a person's life,

00:19:52.484 --> 00:19:53.693 position:50% align:center
and mine's at stake.

00:19:53.777 --> 00:19:55.779 position:50% align:center
[WOMAN 8B]
The measurements are done.

00:19:55.862 --> 00:19:57.072 position:50% align:center
[TANUMA]
And?

00:19:57.155 --> 00:19:58.865 position:50% align:center
She's in possession
of a healthy, happy heart.

00:19:58.948 --> 00:20:00.325 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA]
I don't believe you!

00:20:00.408 --> 00:20:02.744 position:50% align:center
There had to be at
least a couple holes in it!

00:20:02.827 --> 00:20:04.829 position:50% align:center
[TANUMA] You'd be dead
by now if there were.

00:20:04.913 --> 00:20:06.247 position:50% align:center
But I nearly died!

00:20:06.331 --> 00:20:08.291 position:50% align:center
So being in love has the
power to make you topple over

00:20:08.375 --> 00:20:10.126 position:50% align:center
when someone touches your cheek?

00:20:10.210 --> 00:20:12.253 position:50% align:center
I admit, the gesture
was fairly pleasing to me.

00:20:12.337 --> 00:20:14.422 position:50% align:center
But I would literally have to
love the president to death

00:20:14.506 --> 00:20:16.716 position:50% align:center
for me to hit the
floor the way I did!

00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:17.801 position:50% align:center
You wouldn't happen to have

00:20:17.884 --> 00:20:19.469 position:50% align:center
a picture of him on
hand, would you?

00:20:19.552 --> 00:20:22.305 position:50% align:center
Yes, if Hayasaka brings
me my phone, I do.

00:20:22.389 --> 00:20:24.766 position:50% align:center
Stop hiding behind your
hands and get over here!

00:20:24.849 --> 00:20:27.018 position:50% align:center
[HAYASAKA]
Okay...

00:20:28.937 --> 00:20:31.523 position:50% align:center
[TANUMA] You don't have
a normal photo of him?

00:20:31.606 --> 00:20:33.358 position:50% align:center
How strange, yet...

00:20:33.441 --> 00:20:34.859 position:50% align:center
...he seems like a nice kid.

00:20:34.943 --> 00:20:37.737 position:50% align:center
And he's interesting enough
to be a good match for you.

00:20:37.821 --> 00:20:39.322 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA]
Seriously?

00:20:39.406 --> 00:20:41.866 position:50% align:center
[TANUMA] Pardon me for prying,
but do you not wish to date him?

00:20:41.950 --> 00:20:45.161 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA sighs] Our relationship
is a little complicated.

00:20:45.245 --> 00:20:47.706 position:50% align:center
I just find him to be
an ideal human, that's all.

00:20:47.789 --> 00:20:51.042 position:50% align:center
It doesn't mean I have to
date him or anything. Jeez!

00:20:51.126 --> 00:20:52.127 position:50% align:center
Telling me he's a "good match"

00:20:52.210 --> 00:20:54.129 position:50% align:center
doesn't affect me
in the slightest.

[WOMAN 8B]
Her pulse is over 200.

00:20:56.297 --> 00:20:57.757 position:50% align:center
It's beating so fast.

00:20:57.841 --> 00:20:58.967 position:50% align:center
[HAYASAKA]
Stop it!

00:20:59.050 --> 00:21:00.760 position:50% align:center
You shouldn't abuse
your fancy technology

00:21:00.844 --> 00:21:03.138 position:50% align:center
to expose her emotions!
It's not right!

00:21:03.221 --> 00:21:06.141 position:50% align:center
Have you noticed any changes
in her state of mind recently?

00:21:08.893 --> 00:21:10.020 position:50% align:center
[HAYASAKA]
The other day,

00:21:10.103 --> 00:21:12.772 position:50% align:center
she came absurdly
close to kissing him.

00:21:12.856 --> 00:21:15.275 position:50% align:center
That incident's been consuming
her thoughts ever since!

00:21:15.358 --> 00:21:16.735 position:50% align:center
Ah, that would explain it, yes.

00:21:16.818 --> 00:21:19.404 position:50% align:center
Shut up, you traitor! That's
totally unrelated to this!

00:21:19.487 --> 00:21:20.989 position:50% align:center
[HAYASAKA]
She's in complete denial!

00:21:21.072 --> 00:21:22.991 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA] The only emotion I felt
in that situation was terror,

00:21:23.074 --> 00:21:24.659 position:50% align:center
okay?! When he was on top of me,

00:21:24.743 --> 00:21:26.870 position:50% align:center
my mind went blank and
I had no idea what to do!

00:21:26.953 --> 00:21:28.288 position:50% align:center
I was petrified!

00:21:28.371 --> 00:21:31.374 position:50% align:center
I'm not in love with him!
I'm afraid of him!

00:21:39.174 --> 00:21:41.509 position:50% align:center
[TANUMA]
I know exactly how you feel.

00:21:41.593 --> 00:21:44.596 position:50% align:center
There was a time when
I, too, fell in love.

00:21:44.679 --> 00:21:47.807 position:50% align:center
Although, I suppose I never
really outgrew it, I--

00:21:47.891 --> 00:21:50.268 position:50% align:center
I couldn't care less!
