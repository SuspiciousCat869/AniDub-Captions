[NARRATOR]
Underwear!

00:00:15.181 --> 00:00:17.142 position:50% align:center
The thin layer of
fabric that conceals

00:00:17.225 --> 00:00:20.020 position:50% align:center
ones most private parts
from the rest of the world.

00:00:20.103 --> 00:00:23.314 position:50% align:center
An intimate article
others rarely get to see.

00:00:23.398 --> 00:00:24.607 position:50% align:center
There are even
those who've developed

00:00:24.691 --> 00:00:26.651 position:50% align:center
what's known as
an "underwear fetish."

00:00:26.735 --> 00:00:28.903 position:50% align:center
The mere sight of the
material is gratifying

00:00:28.987 --> 00:00:31.573 position:50% align:center
for people with
this unique fixation.

00:00:33.825 --> 00:00:34.617 position:50% align:center
[CHIKA screams]

00:00:34.701 --> 00:00:37.328 position:50% align:center
[YU screams]

00:00:37.412 --> 00:00:38.621 position:50% align:center
What's the big idea?!

00:00:38.705 --> 00:00:41.833 position:50% align:center
You are not in the
privacy of your own bedroom!

00:00:41.916 --> 00:00:44.169 position:50% align:center
So what were you about to do?

00:00:44.252 --> 00:00:47.005 position:50% align:center
[CHIKA grunts, whispers]

00:00:47.088 --> 00:00:49.466 position:50% align:center
Not that! Jeez, Fujiwara!

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:51.468 position:50% align:center
I didn't have time
to change after P.E.

00:00:51.551 --> 00:00:53.511 position:50% align:center
'cause I was asked to
clean up the equipment.

00:00:53.595 --> 00:00:55.638 position:50% align:center
Oh! That makes sense.

00:00:55.722 --> 00:00:58.058 position:50% align:center
Sorry I suspected you of
something much worse!

00:00:58.141 --> 00:00:59.601 position:50% align:center
Ugh, forgiven.

00:00:59.684 --> 00:01:01.019 position:50% align:center
[CHIKA giggles] At least we
learned a valuable lesson today.

00:01:01.102 --> 00:01:03.396 position:50% align:center
[YU]

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.524 position:50% align:center
Ishigami likes
them tighty-whities.

00:01:06.608 --> 00:01:08.485 position:50% align:center
You pervert!

00:01:08.568 --> 00:01:09.736 position:50% align:center
[CHIKA chuckles]

00:01:09.819 --> 00:01:12.072 position:50% align:center
Wow, that comeback
really sucked, am I right?

00:01:12.155 --> 00:01:14.282 position:50% align:center
What happened?
Did you forget to sharpen

00:01:14.366 --> 00:01:17.118 position:50% align:center
your verbal switchblade
this morning, huh?

00:01:17.202 --> 00:01:19.162 position:50% align:center
There is nothing wrong
with wearing briefs!

00:01:19.245 --> 00:01:21.122 position:50% align:center
I like the support and they're
comfy!

00:01:21.206 --> 00:01:23.166 position:50% align:center
I'm just making an observation.

00:01:23.249 --> 00:01:24.959 position:50% align:center
But if you like
comfort and support,

00:01:25.043 --> 00:01:26.252 position:50% align:center
give boxer briefs a try!

00:01:26.336 --> 00:01:29.172 position:50% align:center
[YU yells] Why do
girls prefer boxers?! Why?!

00:01:29.255 --> 00:01:30.590 position:50% align:center
[YU] Actually, I know why.

00:01:30.674 --> 00:01:32.592 position:50% align:center
You ladies think
boxer briefs are sexy

00:01:32.676 --> 00:01:35.011 position:50% align:center
because they showcase
a guy's tushy, but in reality...

00:01:35.095 --> 00:01:37.013 position:50% align:center
The men who allow
women to dictate

00:01:37.097 --> 00:01:38.348 position:50% align:center
their choice of underwear

00:01:38.431 --> 00:01:41.393 position:50% align:center
are as flimsy as the
material of said underwear!

00:01:41.476 --> 00:01:42.727 position:50% align:center
Listen up!

00:01:42.811 --> 00:01:44.229 position:50% align:center
Every guy who subjects himself

00:01:44.312 --> 00:01:47.148 position:50% align:center
to wearing boxer briefs
is a man whore!

00:01:47.232 --> 00:01:49.401 position:50% align:center
The uniform of a man whore!

00:01:49.484 --> 00:01:51.820 position:50% align:center
Uh, what's a man whore?

00:01:51.903 --> 00:01:55.156 position:50% align:center
Um, hey, Siri, search
"man whore." Thanks.

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:56.825 position:50% align:center
[STUDENTS]
Boo...

00:01:56.908 --> 00:01:59.369 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA gasps]

00:01:59.452 --> 00:02:03.373 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA] Are all guys who
wear boxer briefs like this?

00:03:38.468 --> 00:03:41.054 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA] The president is
quite popular with the girls.

00:03:41.137 --> 00:03:43.723 position:50% align:center
It wouldn't surprise me if he
had a more physical relationship

00:03:43.807 --> 00:03:46.976 position:50% align:center
with some of them,
unbeknownst to me.

00:03:48.103 --> 00:03:49.104 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA]
Although he hasn't given me

00:03:49.187 --> 00:03:51.189 position:50% align:center
any reason to believe
that's the case,

00:03:51.272 --> 00:03:53.692 position:50% align:center
I need to be doubly sure!

00:03:57.195 --> 00:03:58.196 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA]
I must get a glimpse of

00:03:58.279 --> 00:04:00.824 position:50% align:center
what kind of
underwear he has on!

00:04:01.991 --> 00:04:04.744 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA] I could try
spilling tea on his pants.

00:04:06.955 --> 00:04:11.918 position:50% align:center
How clumsy! Here, let me take
those off and dry them for you.

00:04:12.002 --> 00:04:15.880 position:50% align:center
Hooray! I did the thing!

00:04:15.964 --> 00:04:17.757 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA]
What kind of pervert am I?

00:04:17.841 --> 00:04:19.426 position:50% align:center
It's not like I have
some weird desire

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:21.136 position:50% align:center
to see what type
of undies he's sporting.

00:04:21.219 --> 00:04:22.971 position:50% align:center
That's plain gross!

00:04:23.054 --> 00:04:24.764 position:50% align:center
Maybe I should just
ask him outright,

00:04:24.848 --> 00:04:28.768 position:50% align:center
since I don't care about
seeing them firsthand and all.

00:04:28.852 --> 00:04:30.353 position:50% align:center
I mean, it's fairly
common for people

00:04:30.437 --> 00:04:32.731 position:50% align:center
to exchange underwear
as gifts nowadays.

00:04:32.814 --> 00:04:33.898 position:50% align:center
If I bring it up casually,

00:04:33.982 --> 00:04:37.402 position:50% align:center
I bet he'll answer
without blinking an eye.

00:04:37.485 --> 00:04:39.946 position:50% align:center
No pressure.

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:43.074 position:50% align:center
Act natural.

00:04:43.158 --> 00:04:44.701 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA]
Here you are.

00:04:44.784 --> 00:04:46.286 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI]
Thank you.

00:04:46.369 --> 00:04:48.913 position:50% align:center
Do you have a particular
preference for tea?

00:04:48.997 --> 00:04:52.417 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI]
Mm... Uh, Darjeeling or uva.

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:55.503 position:50% align:center
Good taste. You prefer
more refreshing drinks.

00:04:55.587 --> 00:04:58.506 position:50% align:center
Incidentally, what kind
of underwear do you like?

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:01.176 position:50% align:center
What kind...
of underwear I like?

00:05:01.259 --> 00:05:03.928 position:50% align:center
Uhh, let's see.

00:05:04.012 --> 00:05:07.557 position:50% align:center
The simpler the design is,
the less appealing it is to me.

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:11.895 position:50% align:center
I tend to go for styles that
are a little more colorful--

00:05:11.978 --> 00:05:14.230 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI gasps]
Underwear?

00:05:14.314 --> 00:05:16.274 position:50% align:center
That's random!

00:05:16.358 --> 00:05:19.819 position:50% align:center
Wait, is this like when a man
in a relationship requests

00:05:19.903 --> 00:05:22.364 position:50% align:center
that his partner wear a
specific kind of undergarment?

00:05:22.447 --> 00:05:23.782 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR]
Shirogane misinterpreted

00:05:23.865 --> 00:05:25.408 position:50% align:center
the whole situation.

00:05:25.492 --> 00:05:28.161 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI]
What'll happen if I answer her?

00:05:28.244 --> 00:05:29.829 position:50% align:center
Would Shinomiya
actually start wearing

00:05:29.913 --> 00:05:31.831 position:50% align:center
lacy black panties for me?

00:05:31.915 --> 00:05:35.710 position:50% align:center
Better yet, would
she tell me about it?

00:05:35.794 --> 00:05:39.005 position:50% align:center
I'm wearing your favorite
pair today, President.

00:05:39.089 --> 00:05:43.051 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI]
No. Gotta think this through.

00:05:43.134 --> 00:05:44.469 position:50% align:center
The crux of the matter at hand

00:05:44.552 --> 00:05:47.263 position:50% align:center
isn't what kind
of underwear I like.

00:05:47.347 --> 00:05:49.057 position:50% align:center
It's making a request
for her to wear them

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:51.351 position:50% align:center
that doesn't sound creepy!

00:05:51.434 --> 00:05:54.813 position:50% align:center
Can't just blurt out
my panty preference!

00:05:54.896 --> 00:05:56.272 position:50% align:center
You really are quite dirty.

00:05:56.356 --> 00:05:57.399 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI]
It's normal!

00:05:57.482 --> 00:05:59.609 position:50% align:center
Comparatively average
and wholesome!

00:05:59.693 --> 00:06:00.944 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI] Just to be safe.

00:06:01.027 --> 00:06:02.445 position:50% align:center
I should choose
something that's comfortable

00:06:02.529 --> 00:06:04.698 position:50% align:center
for women with plenty of fabric!

00:06:04.781 --> 00:06:07.283 position:50% align:center
Lo and behold!

00:06:07.367 --> 00:06:10.578 position:50% align:center
These might not be sexy,
but having Shinomiya put on

00:06:10.662 --> 00:06:14.207 position:50% align:center
any panties I pick
out for her is hot!

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:15.750 position:50% align:center
Good question.

00:06:15.834 --> 00:06:20.255 position:50% align:center
I forget the technical term,
but they're longer than most.

00:06:20.338 --> 00:06:23.758 position:50% align:center
Also, the material's
tight and thin.

00:06:23.842 --> 00:06:24.926 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI]
Longer than most.

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:27.262 position:50% align:center
Also, the material's
tight and thin...

00:06:27.345 --> 00:06:30.932 position:50% align:center
...tight and thin...

00:06:31.016 --> 00:06:32.267 position:50% align:center
[buzzer sounds]

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:36.980 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA] The President
wears boxer briefs!

00:06:37.063 --> 00:06:37.981 position:50% align:center
Hello.

00:06:38.064 --> 00:06:40.608 position:50% align:center
He's a... rotten man whore!

00:06:40.692 --> 00:06:42.861 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:06:42.944 --> 00:06:45.572 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA] I was wrong to put
my faith in him! So wrong!

00:06:45.655 --> 00:06:49.075 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI] Come back,
Shinomiya! It was a joke!

00:06:49.159 --> 00:06:53.705 position:50% align:center
I really like black
panties, I swear!

00:06:53.788 --> 00:06:55.915 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI sobbing]

00:06:55.999 --> 00:07:00.295 position:50% align:center
Wow. Just when I thought
you were a decent human being.

00:07:00.378 --> 00:07:01.755 position:50% align:center
You're a pig.

00:07:01.838 --> 00:07:03.590 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI gasps]

00:07:03.673 --> 00:07:05.633 position:50% align:center
It's not what you think, Iino!

00:07:05.717 --> 00:07:09.512 position:50% align:center
[MIKO gasps] Wait! I don't
even own black panties!

00:07:09.596 --> 00:07:10.930 position:50% align:center
I promise!

00:07:11.014 --> 00:07:13.558 position:50% align:center
Please don't attack me!

00:07:15.185 --> 00:07:18.063 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI]
How did it turn out like this?!

00:07:18.146 --> 00:07:20.065 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR]
Results for today's battle:

00:07:20.148 --> 00:07:24.194 position:50% align:center
Shirogane loses his dignity.

00:07:27.822 --> 00:07:29.157 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA] I wanted to apologize
for

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:31.618 position:50% align:center
the weird accusation I made the
other day.

00:07:31.701 --> 00:07:33.912 position:50% align:center
Oh. There's no
need to apologize.

00:07:33.995 --> 00:07:36.122 position:50% align:center
You and I were just
misunderstanding each other,

00:07:36.206 --> 00:07:37.457 position:50% align:center
that's all.

00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:40.585 position:50% align:center
No. You shouldn't let
me off the hook so easily.

00:07:40.669 --> 00:07:44.130 position:50% align:center
I'd like to try and make
it up to you if that's okay.

00:07:44.214 --> 00:07:47.592 position:50% align:center
Not a day goes by that
you don't look stressed.

00:07:47.676 --> 00:07:50.637 position:50% align:center
A hand massage would
do you some good.

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:52.180 position:50% align:center
A hand massage?

00:07:52.263 --> 00:07:54.641 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR]
A hand massage!

00:07:54.724 --> 00:07:56.476 position:50% align:center
Best defined as a
method of relaxation

00:07:56.559 --> 00:07:59.771 position:50% align:center
in which therapists stimulate
acupuncture and reflex points.

00:07:59.854 --> 00:08:01.022 position:50% align:center
It's just the hand,

00:08:01.106 --> 00:08:03.483 position:50% align:center
but it has an effect on
every part of the body.

00:08:03.566 --> 00:08:07.612 position:50% align:center
However. Kaguya doesn't have
Shirogane's health in mind.

00:08:07.696 --> 00:08:10.156 position:50% align:center
You wanna stop him
from cheating on you, huh?

00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:11.783 position:50% align:center
Interesting.

00:08:11.866 --> 00:08:15.912 position:50% align:center
I believe one has to actually be
dating in order to cheat, but...

00:08:15.995 --> 00:08:19.374 position:50% align:center
...men are naturally geared
to wanna have sex... a lot.

00:08:19.457 --> 00:08:20.709 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA]
Se--?!

00:08:20.792 --> 00:08:22.961 position:50% align:center
That said, there are still
hormones with the power

00:08:23.044 --> 00:08:24.129 position:50% align:center
to suppress such desires.

00:08:24.212 --> 00:08:25.839 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA]
Now we're getting somewhere!

00:08:25.922 --> 00:08:27.549 position:50% align:center
How can I activate
those hormones?

00:08:27.632 --> 00:08:29.384 position:50% align:center
Having sex releases them.

00:08:29.467 --> 00:08:31.219 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA]
Se--?!

00:08:31.302 --> 00:08:33.221 position:50% align:center
Encouraging him to
have se--

00:08:33.304 --> 00:08:35.390 position:50% align:center
Doesn't help us stop
him from having it!

00:08:35.473 --> 00:08:38.309 position:50% align:center
You could have
"se" with him, right?

00:08:38.393 --> 00:08:40.353 position:50% align:center
No way! And stop mocking me!

00:08:40.437 --> 00:08:42.856 position:50% align:center
Why is the solution
to this so dirty?!

00:08:42.939 --> 00:08:45.233 position:50% align:center
[HAYASAKA] Giving him a massage
would be the other option.

00:08:45.316 --> 00:08:46.818 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA gasps]

00:08:46.901 --> 00:08:49.446 position:50% align:center
[HAYASAKA] Physical contact is
what releases those hormones.

00:08:49.529 --> 00:08:50.780 position:50% align:center
Good energy will be produced

00:08:50.864 --> 00:08:52.532 position:50% align:center
that could draw him
even closer to you,

00:08:52.615 --> 00:08:55.744 position:50% align:center
which means, there isn't a
downside to this.

00:08:55.827 --> 00:08:57.787 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR]
There isn't a downside to this!

00:08:57.871 --> 00:08:59.956 position:50% align:center
It's a clever plan
that serves as an apology,

00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:01.332 position:50% align:center
keeps Shirogane from cheating,

00:09:01.416 --> 00:09:04.836 position:50% align:center
and might even result
in a little love confession.

00:09:04.919 --> 00:09:06.379 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA giggles]

00:09:06.463 --> 00:09:10.675 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI] She could be
up to something, but...

00:09:10.759 --> 00:09:13.845 position:50% align:center
...I can't pass up
this chance to touch her.

00:09:13.928 --> 00:09:15.263 position:50% align:center
Here.

00:09:22.437 --> 00:09:25.857 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI]
Her hands are so soft and small.

00:09:29.069 --> 00:09:34.074 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI]
This is... really kinda...

00:09:34.157 --> 00:09:36.201 position:50% align:center
...painful!

00:09:36.284 --> 00:09:38.578 position:50% align:center
Is she trying to poke
through to the other side?!

00:09:38.661 --> 00:09:40.747 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:09:40.830 --> 00:09:41.915 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI shrieks]

00:09:41.998 --> 00:09:43.625 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR]
Huge amounts of stress hormones,

00:09:43.708 --> 00:09:45.377 position:50% align:center
such as beta-endorphins
and cortisol,

00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:47.629 position:50% align:center
are being secreted
in Shirogane's brain!

00:09:47.712 --> 00:09:50.965 position:50% align:center
His body is sending
out an emergency SOS!

00:09:51.049 --> 00:09:52.759 position:50% align:center
Meanwhile...

00:09:52.842 --> 00:09:54.761 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA] The president
has such big hands.

00:09:54.844 --> 00:09:57.263 position:50% align:center
I love how warm and
welcoming they are.

00:09:57.347 --> 00:09:59.140 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR] Kaguya's
brain is being overwhelmed

00:09:59.224 --> 00:10:01.601 position:50% align:center
by large amounts of
oxytocin and vasopressin.

00:10:01.685 --> 00:10:05.438 position:50% align:center
An endless stream of love
gushes forth from her mind.

00:10:05.522 --> 00:10:08.358 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA] Whatever this
feeling is, it feels so good.

00:10:08.441 --> 00:10:11.111 position:50% align:center
I wish this moment
could last forever.

00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:14.948 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI]
When will it end?!

00:10:15.031 --> 00:10:16.366 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA]
This is really nice.

00:10:16.449 --> 00:10:18.284 position:50% align:center
Uh?

00:10:18.368 --> 00:10:20.495 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA] I know this wouldn't
seem special to most people,

00:10:20.578 --> 00:10:22.580 position:50% align:center
since they probably gave
their parents massages

00:10:22.664 --> 00:10:25.542 position:50% align:center
when they were kids,
but this is a first for me.

00:10:25.625 --> 00:10:29.170 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI]
Ah. So that's why.

00:10:29.254 --> 00:10:34.217 position:50% align:center
It's a pretty common thing,
but she's never done it before.

00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:38.972 position:50% align:center
I'll try to help her learn more
stuff like this from now on--ah!

00:10:39.055 --> 00:10:40.682 position:50% align:center
She's killing me!

00:10:40.765 --> 00:10:42.183 position:50% align:center
[MIKO] I'm sure what
happened the other day

00:10:42.267 --> 00:10:43.810 position:50% align:center
was some misunderstanding.

00:10:43.893 --> 00:10:46.104 position:50% align:center
Those two aren't
really like that.

00:10:53.445 --> 00:10:54.654 position:50% align:center
--I'll do your back next.
--No, that's okay!

00:10:54.738 --> 00:10:56.239 position:50% align:center
--[MIKO] Hello-- [gasps]
--No, that's okay!

00:10:56.322 --> 00:10:58.283 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA] If you think it
feels good now, just wait!

00:10:58.366 --> 00:10:59.909 position:50% align:center
Gotta get rid of
your belt, though.

00:10:59.993 --> 00:11:02.162 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI]
That's really not necessary!

00:11:02.245 --> 00:11:03.830 position:50% align:center
Here, I'll take it off for you.

00:11:03.913 --> 00:11:07.834 position:50% align:center
No! If I feel any better
than I already do, I'll die!

00:11:07.917 --> 00:11:09.252 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA, MIYUKI gasp]

00:11:09.336 --> 00:11:10.628 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA]
Oh, hi.

00:11:10.712 --> 00:11:13.840 position:50% align:center
In the sacred
student council room?

00:11:13.923 --> 00:11:16.134 position:50% align:center
No. How vile!

00:11:16.217 --> 00:11:18.136 position:50% align:center
Would you like to join us, Iino?

00:11:18.219 --> 00:11:20.764 position:50% align:center
[MIKO gasps]
Um, no, thanks!

00:11:20.847 --> 00:11:22.057 position:50% align:center
I'm a novice.

00:11:22.140 --> 00:11:24.559 position:50% align:center
I would only slow you guys down!

00:11:24.642 --> 00:11:26.811 position:50% align:center
--[MIYUKI screaming]
--[KAGUYA] Uh...

[NARRATOR]
Results for today's battle:

00:11:29.522 --> 00:11:34.069 position:50% align:center
Shirogane wins his dignity back.

00:11:34.152 --> 00:11:36.696 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI]
Wow, I feel so loose.

00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:40.158 position:50% align:center
[wails]

00:11:40.241 --> 00:11:43.119 position:50% align:center
The heck's going on, Kei?
Did something happen at school?

00:11:43.203 --> 00:11:44.704 position:50% align:center
No!

00:11:44.788 --> 00:11:48.166 position:50% align:center
This manga!
It's such a tearjerker!

00:11:48.249 --> 00:11:49.125 position:50% align:center
[KEI sniffs]

00:11:49.209 --> 00:11:50.835 position:50% align:center
All this fuss over a manga?

00:11:50.919 --> 00:11:53.338 position:50% align:center
[KEI] Instead of judging me,
you should read it for yourself!

00:11:53.421 --> 00:11:54.756 position:50% align:center
I bet you'll cry, too!

00:11:54.839 --> 00:11:56.257 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI]
Yeah, right.

00:11:56.341 --> 00:11:59.969 position:50% align:center
I'm way too old for that,
but I'll still give it a look.

00:12:01.012 --> 00:12:03.765 position:50% align:center
[wailing]

00:12:03.848 --> 00:12:05.517 position:50% align:center
See? I told you
it would make you cry!

00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:07.769 position:50% align:center
You didn't say the
tears would be non-stop!

00:12:07.852 --> 00:12:09.104 position:50% align:center
[KEI]
Makes you wanna fall in love!

00:12:09.187 --> 00:12:12.941 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI]
I so wanna fall in love!

00:12:13.024 --> 00:12:16.194 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI grunting]

00:12:16.277 --> 00:12:18.947 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI] I wanna experience
love so badly now

00:12:19.030 --> 00:12:22.409 position:50% align:center
I might slip up and confess to
Shinomiya next time I see her!

00:12:22.492 --> 00:12:24.244 position:50% align:center
Of course!

00:12:24.327 --> 00:12:27.580 position:50% align:center
Aww, I wanna fall in love!

00:12:27.664 --> 00:12:32.794 position:50% align:center
We should start dating and have
a <i>shoujo</i> manga romance, okay?

00:12:32.877 --> 00:12:33.753 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI]
K.O!

00:12:33.837 --> 00:12:37.257 position:50% align:center
[bell ringing]

00:12:37.340 --> 00:12:40.844 position:50% align:center
[YU] Uhh, I didn't know you
were into stuff like this.

00:12:40.927 --> 00:12:44.639 position:50% align:center
Well, my little sister
happened to recommend it to me,

00:12:44.723 --> 00:12:47.183 position:50% align:center
and I wound up
in tears by the end.

00:12:47.267 --> 00:12:50.937 position:50% align:center
[YU sighs] I've definitely
read my fair share of manga,

00:12:51.021 --> 00:12:53.314 position:50% align:center
so I can usually
predict the plot twists.

00:12:53.398 --> 00:12:56.443 position:50% align:center
Gets boring when I see
the sad scenes a mile away.

00:12:56.526 --> 00:12:59.362 position:50% align:center
Yep. There's the
tearful development.

00:12:59.446 --> 00:13:01.031 position:50% align:center
Boring.

00:13:01.114 --> 00:13:02.657 position:50% align:center
That's pretty cold.

00:13:02.741 --> 00:13:05.452 position:50% align:center
They're practically
begging you to cry.

00:13:05.535 --> 00:13:07.746 position:50% align:center
[bird chirps]

00:13:07.829 --> 00:13:09.539 position:50% align:center
I knew...

00:13:11.541 --> 00:13:15.503 position:50% align:center
I saw it coming...
but they still got me!

00:13:15.587 --> 00:13:17.505 position:50% align:center
It hits you right in
the feels, doesn't it?!

00:13:17.589 --> 00:13:18.757 position:50% align:center
It's true!

00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:19.966 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI]
Makes you wanna fall in love!

00:13:20.050 --> 00:13:23.094 position:50% align:center
I wanna fall hopelessly in love!

00:13:23.178 --> 00:13:24.846 position:50% align:center
Ah! I need a lady friend!

00:13:24.929 --> 00:13:26.097 position:50% align:center
[door opens]

00:13:26.181 --> 00:13:28.933 position:50% align:center
I smell love talk
coming from here!

00:13:29.017 --> 00:13:31.686 position:50% align:center
But who? Who is currently
experiencing the divine?

00:13:31.770 --> 00:13:34.814 position:50% align:center
No one is. We were
talking about this manga.

00:13:34.898 --> 00:13:36.691 position:50% align:center
It's <i>Go Sweet</i> !

00:13:36.775 --> 00:13:39.277 position:50% align:center
Just seeing the cover
makes me tear up.

00:13:39.361 --> 00:13:41.196 position:50% align:center
Isn't it great?

00:13:41.279 --> 00:13:44.532 position:50% align:center
I bought a digital copy of
the whole series for my phone!

00:13:44.616 --> 00:13:47.160 position:50% align:center
Maybe I'll do that, too.

00:13:47.243 --> 00:13:49.454 position:50% align:center
Is it really that
intriguing to you guys?

00:13:49.537 --> 00:13:52.457 position:50% align:center
I kid you not, it's one of
the best things I've ever read!

00:13:52.540 --> 00:13:55.335 position:50% align:center
Well, based on how much I cried,

00:13:55.418 --> 00:13:58.296 position:50% align:center
I also have to give it
a ten out of ten review.

00:13:58.380 --> 00:13:59.631 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:13:59.714 --> 00:14:01.424 position:50% align:center
Who are you and what have
you done with Ishigami?

00:14:01.508 --> 00:14:04.010 position:50% align:center
[YU] It's still me, I just know
a good manga when I read it.

00:14:04.094 --> 00:14:06.346 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI] She took the bait!
Just as planned!

00:14:06.429 --> 00:14:09.307 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR] The recommendation
solicitation plan!

00:14:09.391 --> 00:14:11.309 position:50% align:center
It's embarrassing
for a boy to admit

00:14:11.393 --> 00:14:13.436 position:50% align:center
he enjoys reading <i>shoujo</i> manga.

00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:15.188 position:50% align:center
But if everybody
else recommends it,

00:14:15.271 --> 00:14:18.274 position:50% align:center
eventually word of mouth will
reach the intended target.

00:14:18.358 --> 00:14:19.651 position:50% align:center
With this strategy,

00:14:19.734 --> 00:14:21.569 position:50% align:center
he maintains a cooler image
by seeming indifferent,

00:14:21.653 --> 00:14:23.488 position:50% align:center
saying things like,
"Yeah, it's not bad.

00:14:23.571 --> 00:14:24.906 position:50% align:center
Figured you guys might like it,"

00:14:24.989 --> 00:14:27.742 position:50% align:center
while simultaneously
piquing Kaguya's interest.

00:14:27.826 --> 00:14:30.120 position:50% align:center
You should jump on
the bandwagon, too!

00:14:30.203 --> 00:14:31.538 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA]
Mm...

00:14:32.872 --> 00:14:34.416 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA]
Thanks, but no thanks.

00:14:34.499 --> 00:14:36.292 position:50% align:center
Manga doesn't interest
me in the slightest.

00:14:36.376 --> 00:14:38.336 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI yells]

00:14:38.420 --> 00:14:40.672 position:50% align:center
That's fair,
but you're missing out.

00:14:40.755 --> 00:14:41.923 position:50% align:center
Why not think of it as studying,

00:14:42.007 --> 00:14:45.093 position:50% align:center
so you can understand
the hype for yourself?

00:14:45.176 --> 00:14:48.054 position:50% align:center
What's the premise of the story?

00:14:48.138 --> 00:14:49.514 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI clears throat]

00:14:50.890 --> 00:14:54.310 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI] The main character is
a girl with major trust issues.

00:14:54.394 --> 00:14:57.480 position:50% align:center
Then a boy who cusses like a
sailor transfers to her school.

00:14:57.564 --> 00:15:00.108 position:50% align:center
But then it turns out that
the boy has a terminal illness,

00:15:00.191 --> 00:15:01.693 position:50% align:center
and he dies near the very end!

00:15:01.776 --> 00:15:03.111 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI]
Spoiler alert!

00:15:03.194 --> 00:15:06.114 position:50% align:center
You never include the
ending when you summarize!

00:15:06.197 --> 00:15:08.616 position:50% align:center
Silence her before
she ruins anything else!

00:15:08.700 --> 00:15:10.076 position:50% align:center
[YU]
Roger!

00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:11.077 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI]
She's still talking!

00:15:11.161 --> 00:15:12.370 position:50% align:center
[YU]
How else can we shut her up?

00:15:12.454 --> 00:15:15.415 position:50% align:center
[MIKO gasping]

00:15:19.210 --> 00:15:21.880 position:50% align:center
It doesn't really sound
like something I would enjoy.

00:15:21.963 --> 00:15:26.009 position:50% align:center
Well, it's a slow burn
kind of story that builds.

00:15:26.092 --> 00:15:29.054 position:50% align:center
An anorexic girl who
doesn't trust anybody.

00:15:29.137 --> 00:15:31.097 position:50% align:center
Makes friends
for the first time.

00:15:31.181 --> 00:15:34.309 position:50% align:center
She gets to experience the joys
of human warmth and compassion.

00:15:34.392 --> 00:15:35.769 position:50% align:center
Such a great start!

00:15:35.852 --> 00:15:38.188 position:50% align:center
Ever since her parents
tried to poison her,

00:15:38.271 --> 00:15:40.899 position:50% align:center
she can only bring
herself to eat canned food.

00:15:40.982 --> 00:15:43.193 position:50% align:center
That's right. Those
flashback scenes of her

00:15:43.276 --> 00:15:45.570 position:50% align:center
surviving off of
crackers are brutal.

00:15:45.653 --> 00:15:47.072 position:50% align:center
And that's just the middle!

00:15:47.155 --> 00:15:50.700 position:50% align:center
Then her boyfriend makes her
curry right before he dies.

00:15:50.784 --> 00:15:53.578 position:50% align:center
She timidly takes a bite.

00:15:53.661 --> 00:15:57.415 position:50% align:center
And then, she says...

00:15:57.499 --> 00:15:59.918 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI, YU]
"It tastes sweet!"

00:16:00.001 --> 00:16:01.127 position:50% align:center
[CHIKA growls]

00:16:01.211 --> 00:16:03.421 position:50% align:center
I was bawling
during that last part!

00:16:03.505 --> 00:16:04.714 position:50% align:center
Right there with you!

00:16:04.798 --> 00:16:06.633 position:50% align:center
[YU] He should've made
the curry a lot sooner!

00:16:06.716 --> 00:16:08.802 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI]
He totally should have!

00:16:08.885 --> 00:16:13.890 position:50% align:center
[GROUP muffled shouting]

make out a single word.

00:16:18.812 --> 00:16:20.605 position:50% align:center
Fujiwara, I'm here...

00:16:23.525 --> 00:16:24.734 position:50% align:center

[MIKO] That's what happens
at the end of <i>Go Sweet</i> ?!

00:16:31.324 --> 00:16:35.704 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR sighs] Let's put Miko
in the loser bracket as well.

00:18:08.838 --> 00:18:12.801 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA] This is the respected

My name is Kaguya Shinomiya,

00:18:14.803 --> 00:18:16.721 position:50% align:center
and I'm just
another ordinary girl.

00:18:16.805 --> 00:18:19.724 position:50% align:center
I'm also the Student
Council Vice President, but...

00:18:19.808 --> 00:18:21.267 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA yelps]

00:18:21.351 --> 00:18:22.977 position:50% align:center
Aw, jeez.

[KAGUYA gasps]

00:18:26.231 --> 00:18:27.440 position:50% align:center
Are you okay?

00:18:27.524 --> 00:18:28.983 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:18:30.276 --> 00:18:32.696 position:50% align:center
I had a feeling you
were somewhere close by

00:18:32.779 --> 00:18:34.155 position:50% align:center
and sure enough...

00:18:34.239 --> 00:18:36.408 position:50% align:center
Uh, what do you mean by that?

00:18:36.491 --> 00:18:38.743 position:50% align:center
[YU]
Want some pudding?

00:18:38.827 --> 00:18:43.331 position:50% align:center
You are what you eat,
so eat something sweet.

00:18:43.415 --> 00:18:46.751 position:50% align:center
You like pudding, don't you?

00:18:46.835 --> 00:18:49.462 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA gasps] How am I
supposed to look them in the eye

00:18:49.546 --> 00:18:51.965 position:50% align:center
when my heart's beating so fast?

00:18:55.927 --> 00:18:58.221 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA] The ever handsome
and intelligent school President

00:18:58.304 --> 00:19:00.181 position:50% align:center
forces Kaguya to
join Student Council

00:19:00.265 --> 00:19:02.517 position:50% align:center
because he has a crush on her.

00:19:03.893 --> 00:19:06.438 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA] The dark and brooding
treasurer has eyes for her, too,

00:19:06.521 --> 00:19:08.398 position:50% align:center
but Kaguya can't seem
to stop her feelings

00:19:08.481 --> 00:19:10.567 position:50% align:center
for the president from growing.

00:19:16.823 --> 00:19:18.742 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA] She concocts
all sorts of mischievous,

00:19:18.825 --> 00:19:22.996 position:50% align:center
yet romantic ways to get the boy
she truly loves to ask her out.

00:19:30.337 --> 00:19:32.464 position:50% align:center
[gasps] What should I do?

00:19:32.547 --> 00:19:35.759 position:50% align:center
The president looks
even more handsome than usual!

00:19:35.842 --> 00:19:39.054 position:50% align:center
Actually, so does Ishigami!

00:19:39.137 --> 00:19:40.805 position:50% align:center
Nothing makes sense anymore!

[NARRATOR]
<i>Shoujo</i> manga brain.

00:19:43.183 --> 00:19:45.685 position:50% align:center
A strange mood has overtaken
the student council members,

00:19:45.769 --> 00:19:49.898 position:50% align:center
and the cause is none other
than the <i>Go Sweet</i> series.

00:19:49.981 --> 00:19:52.984 position:50% align:center
The intense longing to fall
in love has blinded them all.

00:19:53.068 --> 00:19:56.404 position:50% align:center
Someone call a doctor!
We've got <i>shoujo</i> manga brain!

00:19:56.488 --> 00:19:58.323 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA] Even the
narrator's been affected!

00:19:58.406 --> 00:20:01.076 position:50% align:center
I have to act now and
get things back to normal!

00:20:01.159 --> 00:20:03.661 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA gasps]
I've got it!

00:20:03.745 --> 00:20:06.915 position:50% align:center
Huh? There's an
envelope in the box.

00:20:08.833 --> 00:20:11.002 position:50% align:center
A pair of aquarium tickets.

00:20:11.086 --> 00:20:13.088 position:50% align:center
They must be from the principal.

00:20:13.171 --> 00:20:15.674 position:50% align:center
Oh, wow! I just adore aquariums!

00:20:15.757 --> 00:20:18.968 position:50% align:center
The fish are so cute,
and it's romantic in a way!

00:20:19.052 --> 00:20:19.969 position:50% align:center
Yes, but...

00:20:20.053 --> 00:20:22.681 position:50% align:center
He only gave us two tickets.

00:20:22.764 --> 00:20:24.557 position:50% align:center
Boo.

00:20:24.641 --> 00:20:27.602 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA giggles] You mean
I only gave two tickets!

00:20:27.686 --> 00:20:30.063 position:50% align:center
I'm sure the president
wants to go with me.

00:20:30.146 --> 00:20:33.942 position:50% align:center
Going with Ishigami would be a
waste of a perfectly good date.

00:20:34.025 --> 00:20:36.778 position:50% align:center
And he's still very
much afraid of me.

00:20:36.861 --> 00:20:39.114 position:50% align:center
There's no way he'd
want to go together.

00:20:39.197 --> 00:20:41.783 position:50% align:center
Will you go with me or him?

00:20:41.866 --> 00:20:43.368 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:20:43.451 --> 00:20:46.204 position:50% align:center
[YU] I haven't repaid you for
that time you helped me study.

00:20:46.287 --> 00:20:48.623 position:50% align:center
I still owe you one.

00:20:48.707 --> 00:20:50.500 position:50% align:center
I actually know
quite a bit about fish--

00:20:50.583 --> 00:20:52.419 position:50% align:center
it'll be my turn to teach you...

00:20:52.502 --> 00:20:54.587 position:50% align:center
[grunts] My techniques...

00:20:54.671 --> 00:20:57.048 position:50% align:center
...are very effective.

00:20:57.132 --> 00:20:58.883 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA]
My heart!

00:20:58.967 --> 00:21:00.802 position:50% align:center
He's never looked
at me that way before,

00:21:00.885 --> 00:21:03.471 position:50% align:center
and now that he has,
I don't know what to do!

00:21:03.555 --> 00:21:05.432 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI]
Not so fast.

00:21:05.515 --> 00:21:10.020 position:50% align:center
Fish may be one of your
specialty topics, Ishigami, but

00:21:10.103 --> 00:21:11.688 position:50% align:center
penguins are mine.

00:21:11.771 --> 00:21:12.939 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA]
My heart again!

00:21:13.023 --> 00:21:14.733 position:50% align:center
Really? You like penguins?

00:21:14.816 --> 00:21:18.737 position:50% align:center
I do. I visit them so often
I know their keepers by name.

00:21:21.322 --> 00:21:25.285 position:50% align:center
They cannot fly, yet
their love has wings.

00:21:25.368 --> 00:21:27.162 position:50% align:center
I'll tell you all about it.

00:21:27.245 --> 00:21:28.955 position:50% align:center

[gasps]

00:21:33.752 --> 00:21:35.337 position:50% align:center
You will have to choose.

00:21:35.420 --> 00:21:36.963 position:50% align:center
Ishigami or me?

00:21:37.047 --> 00:21:39.090 position:50% align:center
[BOTH grunting]

00:21:39.174 --> 00:21:41.009 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA]
Jeez.

00:21:45.221 --> 00:21:47.140 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA]
I'm drowning...

00:21:47.223 --> 00:21:48.350 position:50% align:center
...in emotions.

00:21:48.433 --> 00:21:50.935 position:50% align:center
[CHIKA]
Watch out!

00:21:51.019 --> 00:21:53.146 position:50% align:center
Look! I'm as strong as Yokozuna!

00:21:53.229 --> 00:21:55.482 position:50% align:center
You know, the
famous sumo wrestler?

00:21:55.565 --> 00:21:57.150 position:50% align:center
Yesterday I saw a match!

00:21:57.233 --> 00:21:59.319 position:50% align:center
And I'm still fired up
about all their moves!

00:21:59.402 --> 00:22:00.570 position:50% align:center
Heh!

00:22:00.653 --> 00:22:01.571 position:50% align:center
Good for you.

00:22:01.654 --> 00:22:03.865 position:50% align:center
[CHIKA]
That sounded really fake.

00:22:03.948 --> 00:22:06.785 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Yay! Pudding!

00:22:06.868 --> 00:22:08.328 position:50% align:center
Can I have one? Pretty please?

00:22:08.411 --> 00:22:10.372 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA] He's hiding
the tickets from her.

00:22:10.455 --> 00:22:13.750 position:50% align:center
He doesn't want Fujiwara
to know about them.

00:22:13.833 --> 00:22:15.919 position:50% align:center
There's still a chance
we can go together,

00:22:16.002 --> 00:22:18.713 position:50% align:center
and he's doing all he can
to make sure it happens.

00:22:18.797 --> 00:22:23.385 position:50% align:center
Aww! Great, now he's
gone and got my hopes up!

00:22:23.468 --> 00:22:25.637 position:50% align:center

[KAGUYA gasps]

00:22:31.768 --> 00:22:33.645 position:50% align:center
Did you catch a
fever or something?

00:22:33.728 --> 00:22:34.979 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA]
He's so close!

00:22:35.063 --> 00:22:37.440 position:50% align:center
You should go to the
infirmary if you're unwell.

00:22:37.524 --> 00:22:38.900 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA]
Oh, man!

00:22:38.983 --> 00:22:41.194 position:50% align:center
Why are you suddenly like
the perfect Prince Charming?

00:22:41.277 --> 00:22:44.739 position:50% align:center
[YU]
I'm serious.

00:22:44.823 --> 00:22:47.367 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI] I think I can
take it from here.

00:22:47.450 --> 00:22:48.660 position:50% align:center
Is that so?

00:22:48.743 --> 00:22:51.329 position:50% align:center
But you can't escort her.
Finish your pudding.

00:22:51.413 --> 00:22:52.789 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI]
I'll manage.

00:22:52.872 --> 00:22:54.332 position:50% align:center
No. I'll go.

00:22:54.416 --> 00:22:55.166 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI]
I'll go.

00:22:55.250 --> 00:22:56.334 position:50% align:center
[YU]
No, me.

00:22:56.418 --> 00:22:57.252 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI]
No, me!

00:22:57.335 --> 00:22:58.837 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA]
I can't take it anymore!

00:22:58.920 --> 00:23:01.464 position:50% align:center
All of this passion
really is giving me a fever.

00:23:01.548 --> 00:23:02.966 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI, YU]
No, me!

00:23:03.049 --> 00:23:06.511 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA] I'm melting
like a cup of pudding.

00:23:06.594 --> 00:23:08.179 position:50% align:center
[CHIKA burps]

00:23:08.263 --> 00:23:11.433 position:50% align:center
Since I finished my pudding,
I can take you to the infirmary!

00:23:11.516 --> 00:23:13.309 position:50% align:center
I'm one hundred
percent better now.

00:23:13.393 --> 00:23:15.061 position:50% align:center
Oh. You sure 'bout that?

00:23:15.145 --> 00:23:17.564 position:50% align:center
I never even had a fever.

00:23:17.647 --> 00:23:18.815 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI]
Better safe than sorry.

00:23:18.898 --> 00:23:20.316 position:50% align:center

[YU chuckles]

00:23:27.198 --> 00:23:30.744 position:50% align:center
If you're free then,
we should use those tickets.

00:23:30.827 --> 00:23:32.537 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA gasps]

00:23:32.620 --> 00:23:35.540 position:50% align:center
No. We don't have to do that.

00:23:37.375 --> 00:23:43.715 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA]
After all...

00:23:43.798 --> 00:23:45.050 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA]
Anywhere I go with you

00:23:45.133 --> 00:23:48.178 position:50% align:center
is just as romantic
as an aquarium.

00:23:52.724 --> 00:23:54.309 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI]
She turned me down!

00:23:54.392 --> 00:23:56.895 position:50% align:center
I was smoother than
a penguin's flipper!

00:23:56.978 --> 00:23:59.731 position:50% align:center
Why did she say no?!

00:23:59.814 --> 00:24:05.111 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR] The results for

be bummed the whole time

00:24:06.738 --> 00:24:10.116 position:50% align:center
if I came here with you,
but it's pretty fun.
