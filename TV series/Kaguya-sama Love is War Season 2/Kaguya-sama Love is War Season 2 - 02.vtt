00:01:43.103 --> 00:01:45.647 position:50% align:center
It's time for window-shopping!

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:48.233 position:50% align:center
Gotta make sure we have
plenty of cute clothes for fall!

00:01:48.316 --> 00:01:49.734 position:50% align:center
But if we're window-shopping,

00:01:49.818 --> 00:01:51.361 position:50% align:center
we don't actually buy the
merchandise we're looking at.

00:01:51.444 --> 00:01:53.613 position:50% align:center
Like it matters either way!

00:01:53.697 --> 00:01:55.156 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA]
This is it, Kaguya--

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.284 position:50% align:center
your chance to finally befriend
the president's little sister.

00:01:58.368 --> 00:01:59.911 position:50% align:center
And with his birthday
fast approaching,

00:01:59.994 --> 00:02:01.913 position:50% align:center
the timing couldn't be better!

00:02:01.996 --> 00:02:04.082 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR]
Window-shopping!

00:02:04.165 --> 00:02:07.961 position:50% align:center
The ladies originally set this
day up during summer vacay,

00:02:08.044 --> 00:02:11.131 position:50% align:center
but never got around to
actually doing it till today.

00:02:11.214 --> 00:02:13.341 position:50% align:center
Coincidentally,
that placed it two days

00:02:13.425 --> 00:02:15.301 position:50% align:center
before a very important event:

00:02:15.385 --> 00:02:17.762 position:50% align:center
Miyuki Shirogane's B-day!

00:02:17.846 --> 00:02:20.598 position:50% align:center
And who better to ask what
he wants than his sister?

00:02:20.682 --> 00:02:22.308 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA]
It seems Fujiwara has no qualms

00:02:22.392 --> 00:02:24.519 position:50% align:center
hogging the president's
sister for herself.

00:02:24.602 --> 00:02:26.271 position:50% align:center
So that's how it's gonna be?

00:02:26.354 --> 00:02:28.773 position:50% align:center
Well, two can play
at this kind of game.

00:02:28.857 --> 00:02:31.568 position:50% align:center
I wanna walk with
Kaguya as my arm candy!

00:02:31.651 --> 00:02:32.861 position:50% align:center
Uh, okay.

00:02:32.944 --> 00:02:35.488 position:50% align:center
You have no idea how
happy this makes me! Yay!

00:02:35.572 --> 00:02:38.158 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA] Then that, I'm afraid,
only makes one of us.

00:02:38.241 --> 00:02:40.702 position:50% align:center
It's not like Moeha
isn't nice, but...

00:02:40.785 --> 00:02:42.912 position:50% align:center
Don't you think
Kei is the cutest?

00:02:42.996 --> 00:02:45.373 position:50% align:center
She's as popular with the
girls as she is the boys,

00:02:45.457 --> 00:02:47.250 position:50% align:center
and it's not very
hard to see why!

00:02:47.334 --> 00:02:49.127 position:50% align:center
[MOEHA] Her diligent work
ethic and honest nature

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:52.589 position:50% align:center
make her one of the purest
cinnamon rolls I've ever seen!

00:02:52.672 --> 00:02:54.299 position:50% align:center
Exactly the type
of girl you wanna see

00:02:54.382 --> 00:02:56.343 position:50% align:center
get defiled in the worst way.

00:02:56.426 --> 00:02:57.594 position:50% align:center
I wish I could lock her up

00:02:57.677 --> 00:02:59.888 position:50% align:center
and torment her for
the rest of her life!

00:02:59.971 --> 00:03:02.098 position:50% align:center
Oh, but you have nothing
to worry about, Kaguya!

00:03:02.182 --> 00:03:04.225 position:50% align:center
When it comes to
people I wanna devour,

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:06.978 position:50% align:center
you're ranked number one
on my list, no contest!

00:03:07.062 --> 00:03:09.481 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA]
She's terrifying!

00:03:09.564 --> 00:03:12.025 position:50% align:center
If I don't swap shopping
partners with Fujiwara soon,

00:03:12.108 --> 00:03:15.111 position:50% align:center
I feel like I'll never
escape Moeha's clutches!

00:03:15.195 --> 00:03:18.114 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR] Sadly, Moeha
wasn't the only obstacle

00:03:18.198 --> 00:03:21.076 position:50% align:center
Kaguya faced in her
attempt to talk to Kei.

00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:23.953 position:50% align:center
With the Fujiwara sisters
monopolizing Kei's sides,

00:03:24.037 --> 00:03:27.916 position:50% align:center
Kaguya couldn't even tap
that ice, let alone break it.

00:03:30.085 --> 00:03:32.796 position:50% align:center
This thing costs 450
newspaper deliveries.

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:34.673 position:50% align:center
What was that about newspapers?

00:03:34.756 --> 00:03:36.091 position:50% align:center
Oh, never mind.

00:03:36.174 --> 00:03:39.469 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA] Hayasaka always
prepares my clothes for me.

00:03:39.552 --> 00:03:41.596 position:50% align:center
I've never bought
something for myself.

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:44.891 position:50% align:center
Right, right?

00:03:44.974 --> 00:03:46.726 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA] I think it'd be
best to wait for them here

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:49.312 position:50% align:center
until they finish
their shopping.

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:52.190 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:03:54.776 --> 00:03:56.069 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:03:56.152 --> 00:03:57.737 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA]
Her side profile!

00:03:57.821 --> 00:04:01.282 position:50% align:center
She looks just
like the president!

00:04:01.366 --> 00:04:02.617 position:50% align:center
So, um...

00:04:02.701 --> 00:04:04.869 position:50% align:center
Yes? Is there something
on your mind, little sis?

00:04:04.953 --> 00:04:06.204 position:50% align:center
What'd you say?

00:04:06.287 --> 00:04:08.206 position:50% align:center
Oh, I guess I should've
called you Miss Shirogane.

00:04:08.289 --> 00:04:09.582 position:50% align:center
Does that sound better?

00:04:09.666 --> 00:04:11.835 position:50% align:center
Nah. You can call me Kei.

00:04:11.918 --> 00:04:13.920 position:50% align:center
I mean, you are older than me.

00:04:14.004 --> 00:04:14.879 position:50% align:center
Miss Kei it is.

00:04:14.963 --> 00:04:16.381 position:50% align:center
Just Kei.

00:04:16.464 --> 00:04:17.632 position:50% align:center
Are you sure that's all right?

00:04:17.716 --> 00:04:19.134 position:50% align:center
Positive.

00:04:19.217 --> 00:04:21.636 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA]
Mm... Kei.

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:22.846 position:50% align:center
Thank you.

00:04:22.929 --> 00:04:24.180 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA] It feels so
unnatural to call her

00:04:24.264 --> 00:04:26.307 position:50% align:center
by her first name
when I barely know her.

00:04:26.391 --> 00:04:28.935 position:50% align:center
On the other hand,
this is a major development!

00:04:29.019 --> 00:04:33.231 position:50% align:center
Now I can ask her what to buy
the president for his birthday!

00:04:33.314 --> 00:04:35.692 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA clears throat]
Time sure does fly.

00:04:35.775 --> 00:04:38.486 position:50% align:center
It's already fall and before we
know it, Christmas will be here!

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:40.572 position:50% align:center
Speaking of Christmas,
what kind of presents

00:04:40.655 --> 00:04:43.366 position:50% align:center
are you thinking of
getting your family this year?

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:45.326 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA]
That segued perfectly!

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:47.454 position:50% align:center
[KEI]
Christmas? Not so much.

00:04:47.537 --> 00:04:49.164 position:50% align:center
We're not exactly
the kind of family

00:04:49.247 --> 00:04:52.042 position:50% align:center
who decks the halls or
anything festive like that.

00:04:52.125 --> 00:04:53.585 position:50% align:center
Our dad usually gives us each

00:04:53.668 --> 00:04:56.254 position:50% align:center
a bookstore gift card worth
2,000 yen, but that's about it.

00:04:56.338 --> 00:04:57.797 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA]
I had no idea!

00:04:57.881 --> 00:04:58.923 position:50% align:center
I'm so sorry!

00:04:59.007 --> 00:05:00.508 position:50% align:center
Are birthdays any different?

00:05:00.592 --> 00:05:03.053 position:50% align:center
Surely you guys give each other
presents on birthdays, right?

00:05:03.136 --> 00:05:05.430 position:50% align:center
My brother and I aren't
really close enough to do that.

00:05:05.513 --> 00:05:07.682 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA gasps]
Well, why not?

00:05:07.766 --> 00:05:11.519 position:50% align:center
[KEI] He's stupid, disgusting,
tells lies for no good reason,

00:05:11.603 --> 00:05:14.731 position:50% align:center
and leaves his clothes inside
out after taking them off.

00:05:14.814 --> 00:05:17.275 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA] Who knew the
president was such a slob?

00:05:17.359 --> 00:05:19.611 position:50% align:center
[KEI] Birthdays are
especially frustrating.

00:05:19.694 --> 00:05:21.112 position:50% align:center
As a family, we agreed that

00:05:21.196 --> 00:05:22.822 position:50% align:center
buying presents is
a waste of money,

00:05:22.906 --> 00:05:24.657 position:50% align:center
so we decided to stop doing it.

00:05:24.741 --> 00:05:27.535 position:50% align:center
But he still slips
1,000 yen into my wallet

00:05:27.619 --> 00:05:29.954 position:50% align:center
every year without
saying anything!

00:05:30.038 --> 00:05:31.706 position:50% align:center
And if I ever try
to call him out on it,

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:33.625 position:50% align:center
he feigns ignorance.

00:05:33.708 --> 00:05:35.210 position:50% align:center
See?

00:05:35.293 --> 00:05:37.295 position:50% align:center
Not only does he lie, but he's
stupid about the way he does it!

00:05:37.379 --> 00:05:40.340 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA]
That is such a touching story!

00:05:40.423 --> 00:05:41.925 position:50% align:center
Oh, man!

00:05:42.008 --> 00:05:43.551 position:50% align:center
At first, she made it sound like
he was a complete ogre at home,

00:05:43.635 --> 00:05:45.804 position:50% align:center
but it's no different
than how he acts at school.

00:05:45.887 --> 00:05:47.806 position:50% align:center
Wow! She really had me worried!

00:05:47.889 --> 00:05:49.724 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:05:52.435 --> 00:05:53.895 position:50% align:center
Are you okay?

00:05:53.978 --> 00:05:55.772 position:50% align:center
[CHILD 2A grunts]

00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:00.735 position:50% align:center
[KEI gasps] Looks like you
got a little banged up.

00:06:00.819 --> 00:06:02.404 position:50% align:center
Here.

00:06:03.613 --> 00:06:05.198 position:50% align:center
[KEI]
Let's clean it with some water.

00:06:05.281 --> 00:06:06.741 position:50% align:center
There.

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:11.037 position:50% align:center
[KEI]
You're good as new.

00:06:11.121 --> 00:06:14.332 position:50% align:center
[CHILD 2A giggles]
Thank you! Buh-bye!

00:06:15.709 --> 00:06:19.212 position:50% align:center
Hey, Kei. Wasn't that the
handkerchief you bought earlier?

00:06:19.295 --> 00:06:21.423 position:50% align:center
[KEI]
Yes, but it's fine.

00:06:21.506 --> 00:06:24.134 position:50% align:center
That girl needed
it more than I did.

00:06:27.137 --> 00:06:30.056 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA]
They're so similar.

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:31.641 position:50% align:center
It's uncanny!

00:06:31.725 --> 00:06:32.684 position:50% align:center
She's like him.

00:06:32.767 --> 00:06:34.227 position:50% align:center
I have a coupon for it.

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:36.938 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA]
She's just like him!

00:06:38.565 --> 00:06:41.359 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA] I can't believe
how alike they are,

00:06:41.443 --> 00:06:43.319 position:50% align:center
and the resemblance
is only continuing to grow

00:06:43.403 --> 00:06:44.696 position:50% align:center
the more I learn.

00:06:44.779 --> 00:06:46.156 position:50% align:center
What's wrong with me?

00:06:46.239 --> 00:06:48.324 position:50% align:center
Even though I'm
obviously with Kei,

00:06:48.408 --> 00:06:53.038 position:50% align:center
it kind of feels like...
I'm on date with the president!

00:06:55.498 --> 00:06:59.753 position:50% align:center
[KEI] Thanks, Shinomiya. I had
a lot of fun with you today.

00:06:59.836 --> 00:07:02.797 position:50% align:center
I'd be down to do it
again sometime if you are.

00:07:02.881 --> 00:07:06.176 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Of course!

00:07:06.259 --> 00:07:08.470 position:50% align:center
[KEI]
And maybe next time it could be

00:07:08.553 --> 00:07:10.388 position:50% align:center
just, uh, the two of u--

00:07:10.472 --> 00:07:14.809 position:50% align:center
[CHIKA]
I had so much fun!

00:07:14.893 --> 00:07:16.019 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA gasps]

00:07:16.102 --> 00:07:19.397 position:50% align:center
Let's hang out again
soon, okay? [giggles]

00:07:19.481 --> 00:07:21.775 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA] Jezebel! Throwing
yourself at the opposite sex

00:07:21.858 --> 00:07:24.235 position:50% align:center
like you're some kind of catch
when in reality, you're trash.

00:07:24.319 --> 00:07:27.322 position:50% align:center
A detestable woman who sees men
as nothing more than conquests.

00:07:27.405 --> 00:07:30.533 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR] This is a friendly
reminder that Kei is not a man.

00:07:30.617 --> 00:07:31.993 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA] You've crossed
a line you shouldn't have

00:07:32.077 --> 00:07:33.870 position:50% align:center
and reached a
point of no return.

00:07:33.953 --> 00:07:35.830 position:50% align:center
It's not a group
hug without you!

00:07:35.914 --> 00:07:37.248 position:50% align:center
Uh, me?

00:07:37.332 --> 00:07:39.417 position:50% align:center
[MOEHA chuckles]

00:07:41.044 --> 00:07:43.755 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA] Well, it is
how some say good-bye!

00:07:43.838 --> 00:07:45.215 position:50% align:center
Uh...

00:07:45.298 --> 00:07:48.718 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR] The results for
today's battle: Kaguya wins.

00:07:48.802 --> 00:07:50.762 position:50% align:center
[HAYASAKA]
So despite your efforts,

00:07:50.845 --> 00:07:52.889 position:50% align:center
your research didn't
go as well as you hoped?

00:07:52.972 --> 00:07:54.891 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA]
No, but I did learn something.

00:07:54.974 --> 00:07:56.726 position:50% align:center
The president has been
taught to value money

00:07:56.810 --> 00:07:58.353 position:50% align:center
and not waste it on gifts.

00:07:58.436 --> 00:07:59.854 position:50% align:center
Which means I can't
get him something

00:07:59.938 --> 00:08:02.482 position:50% align:center
that's obviously expensive
because he'll just turn it down.

00:08:02.565 --> 00:08:04.025 position:50% align:center
Ah, I see.

00:08:04.109 --> 00:08:06.736 position:50% align:center
Well, if it's sentimental value
over monetary, that's easy.

00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:08.738 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA]
You have an idea?

00:08:09.989 --> 00:08:13.785 position:50% align:center
[HAYASAKA] Take a ribbon
and wrap it around.

00:08:13.868 --> 00:08:15.078 position:50% align:center
Then you read this.

00:08:15.161 --> 00:08:16.037 position:50% align:center
Okay.

00:08:16.121 --> 00:08:17.789 position:50% align:center
"Happy Birthday to you.

00:08:17.872 --> 00:08:21.418 position:50% align:center
I'm... your... gift."

00:08:21.501 --> 00:08:22.794 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA gasps]

00:08:22.877 --> 00:08:26.631 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA]
Hayasaka!

00:08:34.472 --> 00:08:35.598 position:50% align:center
So what do you think?

00:08:35.682 --> 00:08:36.808 position:50% align:center
If it looks specially made,

00:08:36.891 --> 00:08:38.643 position:50% align:center
it's because that's
precisely what it is!

00:08:38.727 --> 00:08:39.936 position:50% align:center
The president
probably can't remember

00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:41.563 position:50% align:center
the last time he had
cake on his birthday,

00:08:41.646 --> 00:08:43.148 position:50% align:center
but I think he'll
remember this one!

00:08:43.231 --> 00:08:44.691 position:50% align:center
I made sure the
strawberries I bought for it

00:08:44.774 --> 00:08:47.318 position:50% align:center
had an exact sugar content
of 17 degrees Brix!

00:08:47.402 --> 00:08:48.820 position:50% align:center
And the sponge cake
has a secret, too!

00:08:48.903 --> 00:08:50.030 position:50% align:center
[HAYASAKA]
She hasn't even given it

00:08:50.113 --> 00:08:52.282 position:50% align:center
and I'm already
embarrassed for her.

00:08:52.365 --> 00:08:54.159 position:50% align:center
You okay? Is something wrong?

00:08:54.242 --> 00:08:55.285 position:50% align:center
Not at all.

00:08:55.368 --> 00:08:56.745 position:50% align:center
If this is what you truly want,

00:08:56.828 --> 00:08:58.747 position:50% align:center
then I'll keep my thoughts
to myself this time.

00:08:58.830 --> 00:09:01.166 position:50% align:center
Don't do that. You can
be honest with me!

00:09:01.249 --> 00:09:04.669 position:50% align:center
[sighs] I really miss the days
when you weren't such an idiot.

00:09:04.753 --> 00:09:06.379 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA]
Idiot?!

00:09:06.463 --> 00:09:07.839 position:50% align:center
[CHIKA]
I'll see ya tomorrow!

00:09:07.922 --> 00:09:09.132 position:50% align:center
[YU]
Yeah, what she said.

00:09:09.215 --> 00:09:10.425 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI]
Good work today, you two.

00:09:10.508 --> 00:09:12.719 position:50% align:center
[door closes]

00:09:12.802 --> 00:09:14.429 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA]
Hmm...

00:09:14.512 --> 00:09:16.348 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA]
The president and I are alone.

00:09:16.431 --> 00:09:19.142 position:50% align:center
I'll give him his gift now,
while I have the chance!

00:09:19.225 --> 00:09:22.103 position:50% align:center
I wouldn't be surprised if it
makes him cry tears of joy!

00:09:22.187 --> 00:09:23.855 position:50% align:center
--[KAGUYA] But...
--[HAYASAKA] Idiot.

00:09:23.938 --> 00:09:26.024 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA] That word keeps
running laps in my mind.

00:09:26.107 --> 00:09:28.318 position:50% align:center
How does giving him
a cake make me an idiot?

00:09:28.401 --> 00:09:30.612 position:50% align:center
Fujiwara had a strawberry
sponge cake for her birthday,

00:09:30.695 --> 00:09:32.989 position:50% align:center
so I'm failing to see
what's so idiotic.

00:09:33.073 --> 00:09:33.907 position:50% align:center
[door opens]

00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:36.868 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA]
It's the same thing.

00:09:36.951 --> 00:09:38.912 position:50% align:center
Hmm...

00:09:40.747 --> 00:09:42.540 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA]
It's totally different!

00:09:42.624 --> 00:09:43.875 position:50% align:center
What the heck was I thinking?

00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:45.043 position:50% align:center
Not only is it bigger,

00:09:45.126 --> 00:09:46.086 position:50% align:center
but it looks like
a freaking wedding cake!

00:09:46.169 --> 00:09:48.546 position:50% align:center
I am an idiot! [squeals]

00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:50.048 position:50% align:center
And now that it's
the moment of truth,

00:09:50.131 --> 00:09:51.841 position:50% align:center
the idea of just the two of
us celebrating his birthday

00:09:51.925 --> 00:09:53.677 position:50% align:center
is the epitome of embarrassing!

00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:55.512 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA]
What am I gonna do?

00:09:55.595 --> 00:09:56.763 position:50% align:center
Well, you could
always give it to him

00:09:56.846 --> 00:09:58.348 position:50% align:center
like you originally planned to!

00:09:58.431 --> 00:10:00.725 position:50% align:center
It'd be real shame to see all
of that yummy cake go to waste!

00:10:00.809 --> 00:10:02.060 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA]
Mm...

00:10:02.143 --> 00:10:03.812 position:50% align:center
It's not too late
to call it off.

00:10:03.895 --> 00:10:05.355 position:50% align:center
Think it over with a clear head.

00:10:05.438 --> 00:10:06.398 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA grunts]

00:10:06.481 --> 00:10:07.649 position:50% align:center
What's to think
about when it comes

00:10:07.732 --> 00:10:09.401 position:50% align:center
to celebrating
somebody's birthday?

00:10:09.484 --> 00:10:10.276 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA grunts]

00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:11.945 position:50% align:center
One's dignity and pride.

00:10:12.028 --> 00:10:14.656 position:50% align:center
Is there any celebration
worth such a steep price?

00:10:14.739 --> 00:10:17.701 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR] Kaguya's conflicting
emotions warred in her head,

00:10:17.784 --> 00:10:20.370 position:50% align:center
driving a wrench into
her decision-making.

00:10:20.453 --> 00:10:23.915 position:50% align:center
More drama anyone?
Huh? Okay, let's do it!

00:10:29.379 --> 00:10:31.423 position:50% align:center
My name is Kaguya Shinomiya,

00:10:31.506 --> 00:10:35.051 position:50% align:center
and I wanted to celebrate the
president's birthday with him.

00:10:35.135 --> 00:10:36.302 position:50% align:center
But now that the day's here,

00:10:36.386 --> 00:10:38.638 position:50% align:center
I'm too much of a coward
to go through with it.

00:10:38.722 --> 00:10:41.349 position:50% align:center
There isn't anything wrong
in doing what you set out to do!

00:10:41.433 --> 00:10:43.226 position:50% align:center
Even if it is a
little bit embarrassing,

00:10:43.309 --> 00:10:44.686 position:50% align:center
you'll bounce back eventually!

00:10:44.769 --> 00:10:46.896 position:50% align:center
This was a horrible idea
from the beginning.

00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:48.523 position:50% align:center
You're acting like
it's your job to do this,

00:10:48.606 --> 00:10:50.608 position:50% align:center
but really you're
under no such obligation.

00:10:50.692 --> 00:10:54.029 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR] Civil War of
the Mind, courtroom style!

00:10:54.112 --> 00:10:55.905 position:50% align:center
This is utter ridiculousness.

00:10:55.989 --> 00:10:57.240 position:50% align:center
What absurd thought process

00:10:57.323 --> 00:10:59.701 position:50% align:center
led you to having this
monstrosity prepared?

00:10:59.784 --> 00:11:01.286 position:50% align:center
Uh, I don't really know.

00:11:01.369 --> 00:11:04.039 position:50% align:center
What's so absurd about wanting
to give someone a birthday cake?

00:11:04.122 --> 00:11:06.583 position:50% align:center
It's a perfectly natural
instinct to have!

00:11:06.666 --> 00:11:08.209 position:50% align:center
Maybe you're right. Good point.

00:11:08.293 --> 00:11:11.004 position:50% align:center
[ICY KAGUYA sighs] A "good for
nothing point" is more like it.

00:11:11.087 --> 00:11:13.465 position:50% align:center
Have you forgotten what our
main objective is, or what?

00:11:13.548 --> 00:11:14.841 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA, FOOL KAGUYA]
Main objective?

00:11:14.924 --> 00:11:17.260 position:50% align:center
Our ultimate goal is
to make Miyuki Shirogane

00:11:17.344 --> 00:11:20.180 position:50% align:center
confess his undying love to
us from the bottom of his soul.

00:11:20.263 --> 00:11:22.349 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA gasps]
Yes! That's right!

00:11:22.432 --> 00:11:24.684 position:50% align:center
It's what I've been
striving for all this time!

00:11:24.768 --> 00:11:28.021 position:50% align:center
Why am I putting so much effort
into making him happy now?

00:11:28.104 --> 00:11:30.732 position:50% align:center
[FOOL KAGUYA] I think you
already know the answer to that!

00:11:30.815 --> 00:11:33.818 position:50% align:center
It's because you're in
love with the president.

00:11:33.902 --> 00:11:35.570 position:50% align:center
Objection, your honor!

00:11:35.653 --> 00:11:37.280 position:50% align:center
That couldn't be
further from the truth!

00:11:37.364 --> 00:11:39.324 position:50% align:center
This stupid cake is just
another part of the plan

00:11:39.407 --> 00:11:41.201 position:50% align:center
to get him to confess
his love for me!

00:11:41.284 --> 00:11:42.994 position:50% align:center
Uh, are you sure about that?

00:11:43.078 --> 00:11:45.288 position:50% align:center
Even if it isn't your
main objective, deep down,

00:11:45.372 --> 00:11:46.831 position:50% align:center
you still want to see him smile.

00:11:46.915 --> 00:11:48.333 position:50% align:center
You can deny it all you want,

00:11:48.416 --> 00:11:51.336 position:50% align:center
but I know his smile would
make you warm and fuzzy inside.

00:11:51.419 --> 00:11:56.257 position:50% align:center
And the reason I know that
about you is because I am you.

00:11:56.341 --> 00:11:58.718 position:50% align:center
Admit it. You love him.

00:11:58.802 --> 00:12:00.929 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA]
But I... I can't.

00:12:01.012 --> 00:12:03.264 position:50% align:center
[ICY KAGUYA]
That's enough of that.

00:12:03.348 --> 00:12:04.849 position:50% align:center
We are members of the honorable

00:12:04.933 --> 00:12:06.768 position:50% align:center
and distinguished
Shinomiya family.

00:12:06.851 --> 00:12:08.395 position:50% align:center
We cannot allow
ourselves to fall victim

00:12:08.478 --> 00:12:10.480 position:50% align:center
to an outsider's charming ways.

00:12:10.563 --> 00:12:12.065 position:50% align:center
I will admit that
Miyuki Shirogane

00:12:12.148 --> 00:12:13.650 position:50% align:center
is a top-caliber contender,

00:12:13.733 --> 00:12:15.318 position:50% align:center
and he certainly
has a lot going for him

00:12:15.402 --> 00:12:16.861 position:50% align:center
in terms of physical attraction.

00:12:16.945 --> 00:12:18.279 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA]
Don't admit things like that!

00:12:18.363 --> 00:12:19.447 position:50% align:center
[ICY KAGUYA]
However,

00:12:19.531 --> 00:12:21.074 position:50% align:center
infatuation of this
sort is short-lived.

00:12:21.157 --> 00:12:23.034 position:50% align:center
Once we enter society
and meet more people,

00:12:23.118 --> 00:12:24.661 position:50% align:center
I'm sure we'll come
across a man who can make

00:12:24.744 --> 00:12:27.997 position:50% align:center
much greater contributions
to the Shinomiya family.

00:12:28.081 --> 00:12:29.040 position:50% align:center
Am I wrong?

00:12:29.124 --> 00:12:30.000 position:50% align:center
That's true.

00:12:30.083 --> 00:12:31.710 position:50% align:center
All of it.

00:12:31.793 --> 00:12:34.087 position:50% align:center
I'm not in love with him.

00:12:34.170 --> 00:12:36.131 position:50% align:center
And even if the
president did confess,

00:12:36.214 --> 00:12:39.551 position:50% align:center
it's not like I would
actually date him.

00:12:39.634 --> 00:12:41.052 position:50% align:center
[FOOL KAGUYA]
But he's incredible!

00:12:41.136 --> 00:12:42.303 position:50% align:center
You're kidding
yourself if you think

00:12:42.387 --> 00:12:44.264 position:50% align:center
you can find a guy
better than the president!

00:12:44.347 --> 00:12:46.850 position:50% align:center
[shrieks]

00:12:50.603 --> 00:12:52.105 position:50% align:center
[FOOL KAGUYA]
I wanna go out with him!

00:12:52.188 --> 00:12:53.690 position:50% align:center
Then I wanna kiss him!

00:12:53.773 --> 00:12:56.359 position:50% align:center
And maybe even more than that!

00:12:57.652 --> 00:13:00.405 position:50% align:center
[FOOL KAGUYA] Are you saying
it's wrong to feel that way?

00:13:00.488 --> 00:13:01.614 position:50% align:center
[ICY KAGUYA]
Do you even hear the words

00:13:01.698 --> 00:13:03.199 position:50% align:center
coming out of your mouth?

00:13:03.283 --> 00:13:05.160 position:50% align:center
Father would never
allow a fling like that.

00:13:05.243 --> 00:13:06.661 position:50% align:center
[FOOL KAGUYA]
Which is why I have a plan!

00:13:06.745 --> 00:13:08.371 position:50% align:center
You think I'd defy
him without one?

00:13:08.455 --> 00:13:11.041 position:50% align:center
You're just taking dangerous
risks when you don't have to!

00:13:11.124 --> 00:13:13.168 position:50% align:center
The sake of our happiness
is worth the risk!

00:13:13.251 --> 00:13:14.419 position:50% align:center
When playing with fire,

00:13:14.502 --> 00:13:17.422 position:50% align:center
the best course of
action is to snuff it out!

[JUDGE] All three of
you are overthinking this.

00:13:21.676 --> 00:13:23.094 position:50% align:center
[FOOL KAGUYA, ICY KAGUYA,
KAGUYA] It's the judge!

00:13:23.178 --> 00:13:25.347 position:50% align:center
This trial is about celebrating
the president's birthday,

00:13:25.430 --> 00:13:26.973 position:50% align:center
not your future
together with him.

00:13:27.057 --> 00:13:28.391 position:50% align:center
Oh, please help me!

00:13:28.475 --> 00:13:30.060 position:50% align:center
Tell me what I should do!

00:13:30.143 --> 00:13:33.146 position:50% align:center
Huh... You could compromise
by throwing out the cake

00:13:33.229 --> 00:13:35.023 position:50% align:center
and saying that his
gift is you instead.

00:13:35.106 --> 00:13:36.524 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYAS]
That's a terrible verdict!

00:13:36.608 --> 00:13:38.401 position:50% align:center
If you come seeking
guidance from a kid,

00:13:38.485 --> 00:13:40.445 position:50% align:center
you got to expect to
get advice you won't like.

00:13:40.528 --> 00:13:42.197 position:50% align:center
This stuff's over
my head anyway, so...

00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:43.531 position:50% align:center
But, Your Honor!

00:13:43.615 --> 00:13:45.200 position:50% align:center
If you're not going to
put an end to this debate,

00:13:45.283 --> 00:13:46.659 position:50% align:center
then who will?

00:13:46.743 --> 00:13:47.660 position:50% align:center
You, of course.

00:13:47.744 --> 00:13:48.870 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:13:48.953 --> 00:13:51.873 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYAS] After all,
the three of us are you.

00:13:51.956 --> 00:13:54.584 position:50% align:center
It's been your
decision the whole time.

00:13:55.877 --> 00:13:57.003 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA]
So...

00:13:57.087 --> 00:13:59.714 position:50% align:center
...what do you want us to do?

00:14:03.551 --> 00:14:05.345 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI]
Uh, uhh...

00:14:05.428 --> 00:14:07.764 position:50% align:center
Why did you turn off the light?

00:14:07.847 --> 00:14:11.142 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA] Would you mind...
closing your eyes for a moment?

00:14:11.226 --> 00:14:12.852 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:14:12.936 --> 00:14:13.978 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA]
This is embarrassing,

00:14:14.062 --> 00:14:16.398 position:50% align:center
so please keep them
closed till I say.

00:14:16.481 --> 00:14:18.858 position:50% align:center
Um, sure.

00:14:18.942 --> 00:14:23.321 position:50% align:center
[door opens, rustling]

00:14:23.405 --> 00:14:26.574 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI]
Sounds like clothes rustling.

00:14:26.658 --> 00:14:27.659 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI panting]

00:14:27.742 --> 00:14:30.161 position:50% align:center
The suspense might
literally kill me!

00:14:30.245 --> 00:14:33.832 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA]
Okay, you can open them.

00:14:38.670 --> 00:14:43.466 position:50% align:center
I just want to wish
you a happy birthday.

00:14:43.550 --> 00:14:44.801 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:14:44.884 --> 00:14:47.012 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA]
Go ahead and open your present.

00:14:47.095 --> 00:14:48.263 position:50% align:center
[thud]

00:14:50.432 --> 00:14:52.600 position:50% align:center
A fan?

00:14:52.684 --> 00:14:54.060 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA] I know it's
not the season for them,

00:14:54.144 --> 00:14:55.729 position:50% align:center
but you wear a jacket
even in the summer

00:14:55.812 --> 00:14:56.938 position:50% align:center
when it's hot outside.

00:14:57.022 --> 00:14:57.981 position:50% align:center
Oh, and...

00:14:58.064 --> 00:15:01.026 position:50% align:center
...I did the calligraphy.

00:15:01.109 --> 00:15:02.444 position:50% align:center
That's really nice.

00:15:02.527 --> 00:15:05.280 position:50% align:center
On that note, I think
I'll be heading home now.

00:15:05.363 --> 00:15:06.865 position:50% align:center
But...

00:15:06.948 --> 00:15:10.076 position:50% align:center
...whatever you do,
don't open that closet.

00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:11.036 position:50% align:center
Uh.

00:15:11.119 --> 00:15:11.870 position:50% align:center
Okay.

00:15:11.953 --> 00:15:14.080 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA]
See you later.

00:15:22.464 --> 00:15:24.924 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI]
This is awesome!

00:15:25.008 --> 00:15:27.969 position:50% align:center
I feel... so alive right now!

00:15:28.053 --> 00:15:33.892 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA panting]

00:15:33.975 --> 00:15:37.729 position:50% align:center
You did an excellent job.

00:15:37.812 --> 00:15:39.814 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR]
The results for today's battle:

00:15:39.898 --> 00:15:41.816 position:50% align:center
Team Kaguya wins.

00:15:41.900 --> 00:15:44.110 position:50% align:center
I love it! I love it!

00:15:44.194 --> 00:15:46.654 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR]
Happy birthday, Shirogane.

00:15:46.738 --> 00:15:50.617 position:50% align:center
To celebrate, here's
Kaguya eating a giant cake.

00:15:51.534 --> 00:15:53.620 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI] "Study with such
diligence and devotion

00:15:53.703 --> 00:15:57.332 position:50% align:center
that you wear a hole through
your metal inkstone."

00:15:57.415 --> 00:15:58.833 position:50% align:center
A proverb from the story of how

00:15:58.917 --> 00:16:01.670 position:50% align:center
Sang Weihan passed
the imperial exam.

00:16:01.753 --> 00:16:03.546 position:50% align:center
It's a fine expression.

00:16:03.630 --> 00:16:05.590 position:50% align:center
And Shinomiya wrote it herself.

00:16:05.674 --> 00:16:07.425 position:50% align:center
In other words, she
believes this expression

00:16:07.509 --> 00:16:09.844 position:50% align:center
is befitting of a diligent
scholar like me.

00:16:09.928 --> 00:16:13.306 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI chuckles]

00:16:13.390 --> 00:16:14.432 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI gasps]

00:16:14.516 --> 00:16:15.475 position:50% align:center
[CHIKA]
Hi!

00:16:15.558 --> 00:16:16.851 position:50% align:center
Hello.

00:16:16.935 --> 00:16:18.103 position:50% align:center
Oh, hey.

00:16:18.186 --> 00:16:19.604 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI]
One giant question keeps

00:16:19.688 --> 00:16:21.731 position:50% align:center
bubbling to the top of my mind.

00:16:21.815 --> 00:16:23.441 position:50% align:center
Why did Shinomiya
choose to celebrate

00:16:23.525 --> 00:16:25.985 position:50% align:center
my birthday without
telling anybody else?

00:16:26.069 --> 00:16:27.445 position:50% align:center
I'm stumped.

00:16:27.529 --> 00:16:29.322 position:50% align:center
I'm almost positive that a
certain meaning is attached

00:16:29.406 --> 00:16:32.367 position:50% align:center
when a woman celebrates a
man's birthday alone with him.

00:16:32.450 --> 00:16:34.577 position:50% align:center
A certain romantic meaning.

00:16:34.661 --> 00:16:36.746 position:50% align:center
There's no doubt she'd
be aware of how it looked,

00:16:36.830 --> 00:16:38.415 position:50% align:center
yet she still endured
the embarrassment

00:16:38.498 --> 00:16:39.374 position:50% align:center
of going through with it.

00:16:39.457 --> 00:16:40.458 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR]
Yep.

00:16:40.542 --> 00:16:41.835 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI]
That can't be right though.

00:16:41.918 --> 00:16:43.378 position:50% align:center
It's way too good to be true.

00:16:43.461 --> 00:16:45.422 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR]
But it is...

00:16:45.505 --> 00:16:46.965 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI] And this fan.

00:16:47.048 --> 00:16:48.967 position:50% align:center
I could use it to
make her confess her love

00:16:49.050 --> 00:16:51.177 position:50% align:center
to me with a flick of my wrist.

00:16:51.261 --> 00:16:52.262 position:50% align:center
For example...

00:16:52.345 --> 00:16:53.847 position:50% align:center
Where'd you get
a fancy fan like that?

00:16:53.930 --> 00:16:56.141 position:50% align:center
Yesterday just happened
to be my birthday

00:16:56.224 --> 00:16:57.934 position:50% align:center
and Shinomiya gave
it to me as a gift.

00:16:58.018 --> 00:17:01.521 position:50% align:center
[CHIKA gasps] I didn't know that
yesterday was your birthday!

00:17:01.604 --> 00:17:04.399 position:50% align:center
Why would you keep something
so important a secret from me?

00:17:04.482 --> 00:17:05.984 position:50% align:center
I would've helped
to make it special!

00:17:06.067 --> 00:17:09.696 position:50% align:center
But you had to go and keep the
president all to yourself, huh?!

00:17:09.779 --> 00:17:11.239 position:50% align:center
I get it.

00:17:11.322 --> 00:17:13.616 position:50% align:center
You stayed quiet because you
fell in love with him, right?

00:17:13.700 --> 00:17:15.702 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA screams]

00:17:17.871 --> 00:17:19.372 position:50% align:center
[YU]
Did she say love?!

00:17:19.456 --> 00:17:21.374 position:50% align:center
[TSUBASA] I told you
guys he was a lady-killer!

00:17:21.458 --> 00:17:22.959 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR]
<i>Fait accompli!</i>

00:17:23.043 --> 00:17:24.836 position:50% align:center
Peer pressure can be
extremely effective

00:17:24.919 --> 00:17:27.047 position:50% align:center
when convincing someone
to admit her feelings.

00:17:27.130 --> 00:17:28.923 position:50% align:center
If the people around
her accept it as reality,

00:17:29.007 --> 00:17:32.218 position:50% align:center
she kinda has no choice
but to do the same.

00:17:32.302 --> 00:17:33.970 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI]
The only problem is Shinomiya

00:17:34.054 --> 00:17:36.473 position:50% align:center
gave this fan
to me as a present.

00:17:36.556 --> 00:17:38.224 position:50% align:center
Should I exploit
her good intentions

00:17:38.308 --> 00:17:40.810 position:50% align:center
and back her into
a corner with it?

00:17:40.894 --> 00:17:41.978 position:50% align:center
No.

00:17:42.062 --> 00:17:44.022 position:50% align:center
That's not how I do things.

00:17:45.273 --> 00:17:46.316 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI]
Besides,

00:17:46.399 --> 00:17:47.442 position:50% align:center
with this new development,

00:17:47.525 --> 00:17:49.319 position:50% align:center
I've reached the
level of gift-giving!

00:17:49.402 --> 00:17:50.487 position:50% align:center
It's only a matter of time

00:17:50.570 --> 00:17:53.156 position:50% align:center
before one of her gifts
is a confession!

00:17:53.239 --> 00:17:54.407 position:50% align:center
The best move for now would be

00:17:54.491 --> 00:17:55.533 position:50% align:center
to keep this thing
our little secret.

00:17:55.617 --> 00:17:57.452 position:50% align:center
Where'd you get a
fancy fan like that?

00:17:57.535 --> 00:18:00.705 position:50% align:center
Oh, this? It's a present I got
from a good friend of mine.

00:18:00.789 --> 00:18:02.540 position:50% align:center
 A friend.

00:18:04.042 --> 00:18:05.710 position:50% align:center
[CHIKA]
A "good" friend?

00:18:05.794 --> 00:18:08.505 position:50% align:center
I wonder just how "good."

00:18:08.588 --> 00:18:11.966 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI] Something's off.
I can definitely sense it.

00:18:12.050 --> 00:18:13.051 position:50% align:center
But what?

00:18:13.134 --> 00:18:15.053 position:50% align:center
[CHIKA]
Question for you.

00:18:15.136 --> 00:18:16.304 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:18:16.388 --> 00:18:18.139 position:50% align:center
Are you secretly
in love with Kaguya

00:18:18.223 --> 00:18:20.058 position:50% align:center
or something 'cause
you can tell me.

00:18:20.141 --> 00:18:21.601 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI]
The Hell?!

00:18:21.685 --> 00:18:24.062 position:50% align:center
What? No! Why would
you even ask that?!

00:18:24.145 --> 00:18:25.855 position:50% align:center
'Cause it makes so
much sense! I mean,

00:18:25.939 --> 00:18:28.441 position:50% align:center
why else would you neglect to
tell me about your birthday?!

00:18:28.525 --> 00:18:29.734 position:50% align:center
The biggest
reason I can think of

00:18:29.818 --> 00:18:31.277 position:50% align:center
is you wanted Kaguya
to be the only one

00:18:31.361 --> 00:18:32.737 position:50% align:center
who did something
special for you!

00:18:32.821 --> 00:18:34.239 position:50% align:center
That's really lame, by the way!

00:18:34.322 --> 00:18:36.950 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI] Damn it,
Shinomiya! You set me up!

00:18:37.033 --> 00:18:38.410 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR]
Of course she did.

00:18:38.493 --> 00:18:39.994 position:50% align:center
Kaguya was putting
her plan into motion

00:18:40.078 --> 00:18:42.789 position:50% align:center
before they even set foot
in the Student Council office.

00:18:42.872 --> 00:18:46.001 position:50% align:center
No way! Are you joking or was
his birthday really yesterday?

00:18:46.084 --> 00:18:48.169 position:50% align:center
Oh, wow, I'm surprised
that you didn't know.

00:18:48.253 --> 00:18:49.629 position:50% align:center
He never said anything!

00:18:49.713 --> 00:18:51.131 position:50% align:center
That's kind of odd.

00:18:51.214 --> 00:18:53.258 position:50% align:center
I wonder why he would
tell me, and only me,

00:18:53.341 --> 00:18:56.261 position:50% align:center
when his birthday was, then keep
it a secret from everyone else.

00:18:56.344 --> 00:18:57.429 position:50% align:center
[CHIKA yelps]

00:18:57.512 --> 00:18:59.556 position:50% align:center
You're right it is
quite peculiar behavior.

00:18:59.639 --> 00:19:02.017 position:50% align:center
I have no earthly idea
what he was thinking, do you?

00:19:02.100 --> 00:19:04.352 position:50% align:center
I... I know why.

00:19:04.436 --> 00:19:06.312 position:50% align:center
Kaguya's affection is
all you care about!

00:19:06.396 --> 00:19:09.024 position:50% align:center
Why else would you refuse to
spill the birthday beans, huh?

00:19:09.107 --> 00:19:10.442 position:50% align:center
You were trying to
be so nonchalant

00:19:10.525 --> 00:19:12.360 position:50% align:center
about her giving you
that fan, weren't you?

00:19:12.444 --> 00:19:14.904 position:50% align:center
I can't even make tails
or heads of this right now!

00:19:14.988 --> 00:19:17.949 position:50% align:center
I just wanted to celebrate
your birthday with you, too!

00:19:18.033 --> 00:19:19.075 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI]
What a nightmare.

00:19:19.159 --> 00:19:20.827 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR]
<i>Fait accompli!</i> Again!

00:19:20.910 --> 00:19:22.871 position:50% align:center
The fact that her claims
were even partially true,

00:19:22.954 --> 00:19:24.789 position:50% align:center
made circumstances even worse.

00:19:24.873 --> 00:19:26.958 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI]
I was gonna give her a pass.

00:19:27.042 --> 00:19:29.294 position:50% align:center
But there's no kindness in war.

00:19:29.377 --> 00:19:32.213 position:50% align:center
Lions don't hold back,
even when hunting rabbits.

00:19:32.297 --> 00:19:33.757 position:50% align:center
So if that's the way
you want to play it,

00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:36.551 position:50% align:center
Shinomiya, then game on!

00:19:36.634 --> 00:19:39.804 position:50% align:center
You think I only told
Shinomiya about my birthday?

00:19:39.888 --> 00:19:41.389 position:50% align:center
Now that's just silly.

00:19:41.473 --> 00:19:42.932 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:19:43.016 --> 00:19:45.268 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI] A year ago, she
discovered that date on her own

00:19:45.352 --> 00:19:47.771 position:50% align:center
while reviewing the
Student Council roster.

00:19:47.854 --> 00:19:50.690 position:50% align:center
I never willingly
volunteered the information.

00:19:50.774 --> 00:19:52.025 position:50% align:center
If anyone's at fault here,

00:19:52.108 --> 00:19:54.069 position:50% align:center
it's Shinomiya for
withholding such knowledge

00:19:54.152 --> 00:19:56.029 position:50% align:center
from everybody else
for a whole year!

00:19:56.112 --> 00:19:57.947 position:50% align:center
True. You've got a point.

00:19:58.031 --> 00:20:00.200 position:50% align:center
But what would make her do that?

00:20:00.283 --> 00:20:02.285 position:50% align:center
She does all kinds
of peculiar things

00:20:02.369 --> 00:20:03.787 position:50% align:center
if you stop and think about it.

00:20:03.870 --> 00:20:04.954 position:50% align:center
[CHIKA]
Wait a second.

00:20:05.038 --> 00:20:06.373 position:50% align:center
Are you saying the
person who wanted to

00:20:06.456 --> 00:20:09.959 position:50% align:center
celebrate your birthday
alone was actually Kaguya?

00:20:11.711 --> 00:20:14.673 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI]
How do you like that, Shinomiya?

00:20:14.756 --> 00:20:17.133 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA chuckles]
It seems the president's memory

00:20:17.217 --> 00:20:18.343 position:50% align:center
is a bit hazy.

00:20:18.426 --> 00:20:20.220 position:50% align:center
Did he forget about
the fortune telling app

00:20:20.303 --> 00:20:21.554 position:50% align:center
we did a few days ago?

00:20:21.638 --> 00:20:22.639 position:50% align:center
I honestly tried to get him

00:20:22.722 --> 00:20:24.265 position:50% align:center
to reveal his birthday
to the others,

00:20:24.349 --> 00:20:25.517 position:50% align:center
but he wasn't having it.

00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:28.103 position:50% align:center
In fact, he adamantly
refused several times.

00:20:28.186 --> 00:20:31.106 position:50% align:center
Oh, my gosh! He's fanning
himself with my present!

00:20:31.189 --> 00:20:32.565 position:50% align:center
The incident from
a year ago would

00:20:32.649 --> 00:20:34.234 position:50% align:center
work to my advantage as well.

00:20:34.317 --> 00:20:35.735 position:50% align:center
Recalling something so trivial

00:20:35.819 --> 00:20:37.445 position:50% align:center
from so long ago makes his
affection for me plain to see.

00:20:37.529 --> 00:20:39.656 position:50% align:center
Be still my beating heart!

00:20:39.739 --> 00:20:41.074 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR]
If you can't tell,

00:20:41.157 --> 00:20:43.326 position:50% align:center
that fan is a little more
than distracting for her.

00:20:43.410 --> 00:20:45.120 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA]
Um. What was I saying?

00:20:45.203 --> 00:20:47.080 position:50% align:center
I'm happy to see
you're using the fan?

00:20:47.163 --> 00:20:49.290 position:50% align:center
No! That definitely wasn't it!

00:20:49.374 --> 00:20:53.253 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI] Did I miss something?
Why is she so fidgety?

00:20:53.336 --> 00:20:54.546 position:50% align:center
I guess it doesn't matter,

00:20:54.629 --> 00:20:57.549 position:50% align:center
just means it's my chance
to take her down!

00:20:57.632 --> 00:21:00.802 position:50% align:center
Imagine this. The twilight
sky as our backdrop.

00:21:00.885 --> 00:21:02.512 position:50% align:center
And the two candles
on a slice of cake

00:21:02.595 --> 00:21:05.140 position:50% align:center
she prepared burning
brightly in the darkened room.

00:21:05.223 --> 00:21:06.474 position:50% align:center
[CHIKA gasps]

00:21:06.558 --> 00:21:08.727 position:50% align:center
She put a great deal of
effort into that surprise.

00:21:08.810 --> 00:21:10.145 position:50% align:center
I was beyond astonished.

00:21:10.228 --> 00:21:12.856 position:50% align:center
Is that seriously how
it went down, Kaguya?

00:21:12.939 --> 00:21:14.315 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA]
He smacked his cheek with it.

00:21:14.399 --> 00:21:16.067 position:50% align:center
So it's true then?!

00:21:16.151 --> 00:21:17.902 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA] If I don't get it
together I'll be in trouble!

00:21:17.986 --> 00:21:19.404 position:50% align:center
Hey, guys.

00:21:19.487 --> 00:21:21.865 position:50% align:center
I have some rather unfortunate
news to report, Ishigami!

00:21:21.948 --> 00:21:23.450 position:50% align:center
Yesterday was the
president's birthday,

00:21:23.533 --> 00:21:24.617 position:50% align:center
and no one knew about it!

00:21:24.701 --> 00:21:26.244 position:50% align:center
[YU] Guess that makes
me "no one" then.

00:21:26.327 --> 00:21:27.787 position:50% align:center
Huh? What?

00:21:27.871 --> 00:21:30.623 position:50% align:center
[YU] Hey, Prez. I see you're
already using the fountain pen

00:21:30.707 --> 00:21:33.585 position:50% align:center
I gave you for your birthday.

00:21:33.668 --> 00:21:35.670 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI]
Oh, yeah. It's nice.

00:21:35.754 --> 00:21:38.214 position:50% align:center
[CHIKA] Wait. So you knew
about the president's birthday

00:21:38.298 --> 00:21:39.716 position:50% align:center
before today?

00:21:39.799 --> 00:21:42.594 position:50% align:center
Of course I knew about it.
Prez is always helping me out,

00:21:42.677 --> 00:21:45.263 position:50% align:center
so the least I could do is
remember the day he was born.

00:21:45.347 --> 00:21:46.765 position:50% align:center
Uh...

00:21:46.848 --> 00:21:48.350 position:50% align:center
[KAGUYA]
He's absolutely right.

00:21:48.433 --> 00:21:50.727 position:50% align:center
It's perfectly normal to learn
the birthdays of the people

00:21:50.810 --> 00:21:52.604 position:50% align:center
you work with and appreciate.

00:21:52.687 --> 00:21:53.855 position:50% align:center
Don't blame me.

00:21:53.938 --> 00:21:55.940 position:50% align:center
Blame yourself for
not knowing ahead of time.

00:21:56.024 --> 00:21:58.026 position:50% align:center
[YU gasps]
It never even occurred to you

00:21:58.109 --> 00:22:00.236 position:50% align:center
to find out when the
president's birthday was?!

00:22:00.320 --> 00:22:02.489 position:50% align:center
I can't believe you're the
only one of us who didn't know!

00:22:02.572 --> 00:22:04.407 position:50% align:center
You call yourself
a council member?!

00:22:04.491 --> 00:22:05.909 position:50% align:center
You should be ashamed!

00:22:05.992 --> 00:22:10.747 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry for being
such a disappointment!

00:22:10.830 --> 00:22:12.957 position:50% align:center
[MIYUKI]
Man. There goes my advantage.

00:22:13.041 --> 00:22:14.292 position:50% align:center
You can run all you want,

00:22:14.376 --> 00:22:16.169 position:50% align:center
but there's no escaping
the truth of what you did!

00:22:16.252 --> 00:22:18.546 position:50% align:center
You messed up big time!

00:22:19.756 --> 00:22:23.218 position:50% align:center
Thanks, Ishigami.
You're a really amazing guy.

00:22:23.301 --> 00:22:24.052 position:50% align:center
Did you know that?

00:22:24.135 --> 00:22:25.428 position:50% align:center
[YU gasps]

00:22:25.512 --> 00:22:28.056 position:50% align:center
For a second there,
I thought I might be done for!

00:22:28.139 --> 00:22:30.558 position:50% align:center
I'll definitely have
to pay you back someday!

00:22:30.642 --> 00:22:33.103 position:50% align:center
[YU] Payback? Have I done
something to incur her wrath?

00:22:33.186 --> 00:22:34.938 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR]
Results for today's battle:

00:22:35.021 --> 00:22:38.900 position:50% align:center line:10%
Fujiwara loses big time!
