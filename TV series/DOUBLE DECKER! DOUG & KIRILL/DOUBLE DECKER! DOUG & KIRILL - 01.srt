the release of Zabel Franken,

the imprisoned executive of the
criminal organization Esperanza,

as well as a helicopter to
allow for his own escape.

But unfortunately,
Cyrus is still a Phase one.

So SEVEN-O doesn't
have jurisdiction yet.

Allow me to explain.

Since he was a child,

245
00:12:23,108 --> 00:12:26,150
Kirill has had the same fantasy
every night before bed.

246
00:12:26,233 --> 00:12:28,692
The school, mall,
office, you get the idea,

247

was about to die.

Conveniently, however,
Kirill found himself

away from the others and right
in the enemy's blind spot,

perfectly positioned
to save the day.

with Cyrus down there.

Thanks to him, one of
our undercover officers

[DOUG] Do you know how
Anthem Phases work?

287
00:14:10,442 --> 00:14:12,358
Yeah. Of course. Totally.

288
00:14:12,442 --> 00:14:14,317
He's still only a Phase One.

289
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:17,650
Until we have proof he's a user,
we can only work undercover.

290
00:14:17,733 --> 00:14:19,025
[NARRATOR]
Kirill doesn't actually know

291
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:22,317
much of anything about Anthem.
Here's how it works.

292
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:25,483
All matters relating to Anthem
are divided into Phases.

293
00:14:25,567 --> 00:14:27,650
Phase One is
"Suspected Usage."

294
00:14:27,733 --> 00:14:29,775
Phase Two is
"Ascertaining Usage.".

295
00:14:29,858 --> 00:14:32,067
When it reaches that phase,
all jurisdiction

296
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:34,358
is transferred to SEVEN-O!

297
00:14:34,442 --> 00:14:35,900
Oh, okay.

298
00:14:35,983 --> 00:14:38,108
So I guess that means we can't
do anything right now, huh?

299
00:14:38,192 --> 00:14:39,608
That's right.

300
00:14:39,692 --> 00:14:41,900
But unless I'm mistaken, it
shouldn't be much longer now

301
00:14:41,983 --> 00:14:43,442
before Cyrus reaches
Phase Three.

302
00:14:43,525 --> 00:14:44,858
What's Phase Three?

303
00:14:44,942 --> 00:14:47,358
[DOUG] It's what we call
Anthem-Induced Overdrive.

304
00:14:47,442 --> 00:14:49,775
Okay, and that would be...?

305
00:14:49,858 --> 00:14:51,442
[DOUG]
A side effect of taking Anthem

306
00:14:51,525 --> 00:14:53,817
is that sometimes
its users mutate.

307
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:56,817
When this happens,
they gain inhuman powers.

308
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:58,608
We call that Overdrive.

00:15:00,483 --> 00:15:03,025
I just came here
to get proof of it.

311
00:15:03,108 --> 00:15:05,317
How're you supposed to prove
something like that, though?

312
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:06,650
When you use Anthem,

there's a special mark
that appears on your body.

00:23:08,608 --> 00:23:10,983
What?! You're kidding
about that, right?!

479
00:23:11,067 --> 00:23:13,108
I can't get a perm
with hair like this!

480
00:23:13,192 --> 00:23:14,442
[TRAVIS]
Okay.

481
00:23:14,525 --> 00:23:17,108
But your other options are
"Okappa" and "Dead Guy."

482
00:23:17,192 --> 00:23:19,233
Why are those my
only two options?!

483
00:23:19,317 --> 00:23:20,483
There have got to be more!

484
00:23:20,567 --> 00:23:21,900
Well, there aren't,

485
00:23:21,983 --> 00:23:24,025
so I'd go with "Perm"
if I were you.

[KIRILL growls]

487
00:23:27,192 --> 00:23:28,150
Fine, Okappa.

00:23:28,233 --> 00:23:29,233
Come on!

489
00:23:29,317 --> 00:23:31,150
Perm is obviously
the better choice.

00:23:31,233 --> 00:23:32,817
You wanna sound like you're
a schoolgirl or something?

[KIRILL]
Okappa!

492
00:23:33,983 --> 00:23:35,150
So, uh.

493
00:23:35,233 --> 00:23:36,900
Does everybody who works
here go by a codename,

494
00:23:36,983 --> 00:23:37,983
or is it just for newbies?

495
00:23:38,067 --> 00:23:39,942
It's just Travis's
thing, really.

496
00:23:40,025 --> 00:23:41,983
It's weird, but, so is he.

497
00:23:42,067 --> 00:23:45,067
That stupid "Double Decker" name
was one he came up with, too.

498
00:23:45,150 --> 00:23:47,525
I swear, they get more
ridiculous every day.

499
00:23:47,608 --> 00:23:51,983
Ah. I don't understand why, but,
he wanted somebody with a perm.

500
00:23:52,067 --> 00:23:53,233
[DEANA]
Right.

501
00:23:53,317 --> 00:23:55,108
That was the only
qualification he specified

502
00:23:55,192 --> 00:23:57,400
when he put in a request
for a new hire.

503
00:23:57,483 --> 00:23:59,608
Good thing you got
here a day late, huh?

504
00:23:59,692 --> 00:24:02,442
Otherwise you'd be the one he
made a salon appointment for.

[NARRATOR]
Okappa, AKA Kirill,

is settling into his
new life as a detective.

However, it may not be long

00:24:18,025 --> 00:24:21,192
before he's forced to
bid that life goodbye.
