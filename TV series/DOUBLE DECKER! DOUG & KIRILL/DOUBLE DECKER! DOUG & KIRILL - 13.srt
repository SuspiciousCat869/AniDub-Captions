[DERICK] What? You lost
contact with Doug?

00:00:21,375 --> 00:00:22,833
Let's stick with the plan.

3
00:00:22,916 --> 00:00:24,708
I'll meet up with the others and
go from there, as discussed.

We're countin' on you.

[KAY grunts]

6
00:00:29,291 --> 00:00:30,458
Well, then, Max?

7
00:00:30,541 --> 00:00:32,958
You seeing any military
reinforcements?

8
00:00:33,041 --> 00:00:36,041
No. We're still
all right, I think.

9
00:00:40,083 --> 00:00:41,666
[KIRILL]
Okay, fine, Cooper.

10
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:42,666
I give.

11
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:45,041
You win. I'll come with you.

12
00:00:45,125 --> 00:00:47,583
Very well. Follow me.

13
00:00:51,083 --> 00:00:53,208
[NARRATOR] This is a story
about detectives.

14
00:00:53,291 --> 00:00:55,500
Brave men and women
willing to risk their lives

15
00:00:55,583 --> 00:00:57,250
in the line of duty.

16
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:29,875
[KIRILL] I thought you were
gonna fire that rocket,

17
00:02:29,958 --> 00:02:31,458
so they could come pick me up.

18
00:02:31,541 --> 00:02:33,916
[COOPER] I have to take care of
some last-minute things first.

19
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,041
[KIRILL]
"Last-minute things?"

20
00:02:35,125 --> 00:02:37,250
[COOPER]
Yes. As I mentioned previously,

21
00:02:37,333 --> 00:02:39,958
this base holds a wealth of
classified military knowledge.

22
00:02:40,041 --> 00:02:42,083
Those secrets must
stay protected.

23
00:02:42,166 --> 00:02:44,416
Of course, a system has
already been put into place

24
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:47,041
that will erase every one
of them in case of a breach.

25
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:48,958
In fact, it can
only be activated

26
00:02:49,041 --> 00:02:51,041
in the event that the
facility is overrun,

27
00:02:51,125 --> 00:02:53,375
and not without
my final approval.

28
00:02:53,458 --> 00:02:55,083
Because the activation code

29
00:02:55,166 --> 00:02:58,458
has only been programmed
into my ID card.

30
00:02:58,541 --> 00:03:01,375
All staff on the premises
will get an evacuation order

31
00:03:01,458 --> 00:03:03,166
as soon as the system initiates.

32
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:05,375
And all the facilities'
self-destruct mechanisms

33
00:03:05,458 --> 00:03:06,875
will be triggered, as well--

34
00:03:06,958 --> 00:03:10,125
causing the whole thing to
blow up in exactly 30 minutes.

35
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:13,083
Then, just to be thorough,
the military will send in its

36
00:03:13,166 --> 00:03:15,041
high-tech bombers to obliterate

37
00:03:15,125 --> 00:03:17,916
every last trace
of its existence.

38
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,125
You can't...

39
00:03:19,208 --> 00:03:20,916
You're just going to
destroy everything here?

40
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,208
I am, indeed.

41
00:03:22,291 --> 00:03:24,375
There's no longer
any need for all this.

42

I told you.

43
00:03:26,041 --> 00:03:29,166
The people of Nikai are willing
to destroy entire civilizations

44
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:30,666
just to get you back.

45
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:34,041
That's how invaluable
you are to our enquiry.

46
00:03:34,125 --> 00:03:35,541
The antibodies in your blood

will revolutionize our genetic
modification research.

48
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:41,041
As the man responsible
for bringing you back,

49

I'll be lauded as a hero

and remembered for
generations to come.

Heh. I was tiring of this
mission, honestly.

Toiling away in obscurity
in the middle of nowhere.

That Billingham's an even
bigger fool than I thought.

Ugh. That was a nasty little

Indeed. And, as the

All Brian Cooper's official

00:15:23,625 --> 00:15:25,708
This way I'll always
live on in your heart!

319
00:15:25,791 --> 00:15:26,875
And that's an even
greater hono--

[DOUG gasping]

321
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,166

[KIRILL grunts]

323
00:15:34,083 --> 00:15:35,750
[KIRILL] You really
aren't cut out for it.

324
00:15:35,833 --> 00:15:37,666
Heroes need to be
graceful and dignified.

325
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:39,041
Then you're disqualified.

326
00:15:39,125 --> 00:15:42,125
Yeah. And that's why
we're detectives.

327
00:15:42,208 --> 00:15:43,833
Guess you're right about that.

328
00:15:43,916 --> 00:15:45,875
The comical type, too.

329
00:15:53,416 --> 00:15:55,958
[COOPER] I'll just have to
take you all with me!

330
00:15:56,041 --> 00:15:58,500
If reinforcements come
down from the colony,

331
00:15:58,583 --> 00:16:00,750
then that will mean
the end of Earth.

[COOPER gasping]

333
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:05,291
Uh! Zabel?

334
00:16:07,291 --> 00:16:09,666
How exactly did you
manage to get in here?

335
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:11,250
[ZABEL grunting]

336
00:16:11,333 --> 00:16:13,916
[ZABEL] I came in using
one of those things.

337
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,333
What does "one of
those things" mean?

338
00:16:16,416 --> 00:16:17,666
[COOPER grunts]

339
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:19,125
[ZABEL] So, you're trying
to be the sole survivor

340
00:16:19,208 --> 00:16:22,125
of the season finale.
Eh, Cooper?

341
00:16:22,208 --> 00:16:23,583
[COOPER]
What? No!

00:16:23,666 --> 00:16:25,000
[ZABEL] Don't you think
it's a tall order

343
00:16:25,083 --> 00:16:27,375
for the whole main cast
to make it out alive?

Especially the surprise
villain of the last arc?

[COOPER groaning]

346
00:16:32,208 --> 00:16:33,416
[ZABEL]
Listen to me, Cooper.

347
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:36,750
Don't think of this as revenge.

348

I'm still just angry at you
for your terrible habit

00:16:39,416 --> 00:16:41,333
of wasting perfectly good food.

[gunshot]

351
00:16:55,333 --> 00:16:57,041
I'm sorry, Derick.

352
00:16:57,125 --> 00:16:58,500
About your bus.

353
00:16:58,583 --> 00:16:59,708
Nah, it's fine.

354
00:16:59,791 --> 00:17:01,291
If you're gonna say
sorry to someone,

355
00:17:01,375 --> 00:17:02,916
then you should
apologize to Milla.

356
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,458
[MILLA]
Hm? For what?

357
00:17:04,541 --> 00:17:06,500
Well, I owe you an apology

358
00:17:06,583 --> 00:17:09,708
for not paying you much, and for
blowing up your workplace.

00:17:09,791 --> 00:17:11,458
I don't really care, honestly.

360
00:17:11,541 --> 00:17:15,541
But all I have left on Earth is
the loan, and this little thing.

361
00:17:15,625 --> 00:17:17,958
Uh! You put that
away, right now!

I will throw you off!

It's all gonna
work out just fine.

364
00:17:21,625 --> 00:17:23,333
But now I don't have
any way to pay back

365
00:17:23,416 --> 00:17:24,625
the money I borrowed from you.

[DEANA, KIRILL gasp]

Wait, so, you're his lender?

Oh, don't worry.

Heh.

[KIRILL]
She looks just like her,

372
00:17:38,458 --> 00:17:41,625
but she's still not the
real Yuri, is she?

373
00:17:43,833 --> 00:17:45,291
[APPLE]
No, it's Yuri, all right.

374
00:17:45,375 --> 00:17:46,666
The original, too.

375
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:47,958
[KIRILL]
Huh?

376
00:17:48,041 --> 00:17:50,375
You had better get Travis
to explain that one.

377
00:17:50,458 --> 00:17:51,416
[KIRILL]
Uh...

378
00:17:53,416 --> 00:17:54,791
[TRAVIS]
I'm truly sorry.

379
00:17:54,875 --> 00:17:56,708
Please. I beg your forgiveness.

380
00:17:56,791 --> 00:17:59,750
Uh. He says this is the
ultimate form of groveling.

381
00:17:59,833 --> 00:18:01,250
Uh...

382
00:18:01,333 --> 00:18:02,750
[NARRATOR] Since Travis's head
is embedded in the ground,

383
00:18:02,833 --> 00:18:05,458
let me explain. I'm sure you
remember a few episodes back

384
00:18:05,541 --> 00:18:07,750
when Travis spilled coffee
down the front of his shirt?

385
00:18:07,833 --> 00:18:10,708
Yep, it just so happened to be
on Yuri's maintenance day.

386
00:18:10,791 --> 00:18:12,041
In a moment of clumsiness,

387
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:13,708
Travis spilled his
damn bean juice

388
00:18:13,791 --> 00:18:15,250
right onto Yuri's internals!

389
00:18:15,333 --> 00:18:17,125
This caused her to start
acting bizarrely,

390
00:18:17,208 --> 00:18:18,375
which was not a good sign.

391
00:18:18,458 --> 00:18:20,541
Travis decided she just
needed to dry out a bit.

392
00:18:20,625 --> 00:18:23,000
So, he temporarily activated
Yuri's spare body

393
00:18:23,083 --> 00:18:24,375
without consulting Doctor Apple

394
00:18:24,458 --> 00:18:25,875
and stayed up all
night in secret

395
00:18:25,958 --> 00:18:28,583
workin' on the forbidden task
of copying her core data,

396
00:18:28,666 --> 00:18:31,208
tryin' to cover up his clumsy
and unethical deeds!

397
00:18:31,291 --> 00:18:32,416
[YURI]
I'm Yuri!

[TRAVIS exhales]

399
00:18:33,875 --> 00:18:36,375
Then, that awful
explosion happened.

00:18:36,458 --> 00:18:38,750
The one we all thought
killed our comrade.

401
00:18:43,333 --> 00:18:44,500

But that's her, all right.

402
00:18:44,583 --> 00:18:46,708
The real Yuri.

00:18:46,791 --> 00:18:47,958
Yuri!

00:18:51,458 --> 00:18:53,750
I'm just glad I take
my coffee black.

406
00:18:53,833 --> 00:18:56,666
If any sugar got in, her
circuits could have shorted out

407
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:58,750
completely, and that
might have been the end.

408
00:18:58,833 --> 00:18:59,833
[DEANA growls]

409
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:12,166
Oh. Still got it, Boxer.

410
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:14,666
That was... a great punch.

411
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:15,916
Oh, hey, guys!

412
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,541
Travis just told me
that he's buying today!

413
00:19:18,625 --> 00:19:19,375
Nice, huh?

414
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:20,708
Lucky break.

415
00:19:20,791 --> 00:19:23,916
A lesser man would have
to face real consequences.

416
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,291
Hey, Doug.

417
00:19:25,375 --> 00:19:26,625
[DOUG]
Hm?

418
00:19:26,708 --> 00:19:30,166
[KIRILL] I'm submitting my
resignation to Travis.

419
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:33,041
I caught a real lucky break
this time around, but

420
00:19:33,125 --> 00:19:35,375
there's a high likelihood
that the people of Nikai

421
00:19:35,458 --> 00:19:37,416
will come after me again.

422
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:40,750
And the next time, we might not
all make it out unscathed.

423
00:19:40,833 --> 00:19:43,416
[DEANA]
You're such a dweeb!

424
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:46,041
I'm always amazed at
just how stupid you are.

425
00:19:46,125 --> 00:19:48,791
You could totally hide in plain
sight like you have up till now.

426
00:19:48,875 --> 00:19:51,250
That's right. I'm sure
not gonna tell anyone.

427
00:19:51,333 --> 00:19:53,583
Yeah, and if they do
come back for you,

428
00:19:53,666 --> 00:19:55,791
we'll just have to deal
with them then.

429
00:19:56,791 --> 00:19:58,458
Well, you heard 'em.

430
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:03,416
And SEVEN-O itself might be
done for the time being, anyway.

431
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:06,208
Let's not worry
about the future.

432
00:20:06,291 --> 00:20:09,083
[KIRILL] And, so,
that's how the case ended.

433
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:12,083
They blamed most of it on
Cooper's corruption and treason,

434
00:20:12,166 --> 00:20:14,208
and chalked the rest up to
Esperanza seeking revenge

435
00:20:14,291 --> 00:20:17,375
against him, after he used
and discarded them.

436
00:20:17,458 --> 00:20:20,583
The existence of Nikai
remained a well-kept secret.

437
00:20:20,666 --> 00:20:23,333
As for SEVEN-O's alleged
assault on the military.

438
00:20:23,416 --> 00:20:25,833
We got out of that one partly
because Cooper forced me

439
00:20:25,916 --> 00:20:27,083
into the position
of his adjutant

440
00:20:27,166 --> 00:20:29,166
in order to persuade
me to join him.

441
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:32,291
Then, when I was made aware of
the full extent of his treason.

442
00:20:32,375 --> 00:20:33,583
I was able to enlist their help

443
00:20:33,666 --> 00:20:35,583
putting an end to
everything he did.

444
00:20:35,666 --> 00:20:38,583
And that's how
it all played out.


445
00:20:38,666 --> 00:20:41,583
Of course, nothing happened
to Morgan or the others.

446
00:20:41,666 --> 00:20:43,083
Milla. I mean, Valery,

447
00:20:43,166 --> 00:20:46,083
still helps out
at Derick's place.

448
00:20:46,166 --> 00:20:49,708
And I'm sure Grandpa Dan would
be happy we're together again.

449
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:52,458
[KIRILL]
Oh, by the way.

450
00:20:52,541 --> 00:20:54,708
Apparently, Doug has
no idea why Zabel

451
00:20:54,791 --> 00:20:57,208
even decided to help SEVEN-O
in the first place.

452
00:20:57,291 --> 00:21:01,916
Doug said Zabel probably has
some shred of good left in him.

453
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,666
Soon it was election season,
time for the mayoral race.

454
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:07,958
Right now, the incumbent
is in the lead.

455
00:21:08,041 --> 00:21:10,833
But Dorman is campaigning on a
massive crackdown of drug crime

456
00:21:10,916 --> 00:21:14,458
and seems to be gaining
steadily in the polls.

457
00:21:14,541 --> 00:21:16,958
Wondering why I'm telling
you about any of this?

458
00:21:17,041 --> 00:21:19,583
Well, with Dorman's campaign
appealing to the public,

459
00:21:19,666 --> 00:21:21,791
SEVEN-O wasn't
disbanded after all,

460
00:21:21,875 --> 00:21:24,333
and we're still in operation.

461
00:21:24,416 --> 00:21:25,333
That's right.

462
00:21:25,416 --> 00:21:27,166
Even with Esperanza defeated,

463
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:30,583
Anthem is still around,
and so are Anthem users.

464
00:21:30,666 --> 00:21:32,708
It could all just
dry up tomorrow,

465
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:35,041
or maybe it'll never
really go away.

466
00:21:35,125 --> 00:21:35,916
Who knows?

467
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
I sure can't predict the future.

468
00:21:38,083 --> 00:21:41,583
So, as long as Anthem
is on Lisvaletta streets...

469
00:21:41,666 --> 00:21:44,750
As long as criminals try
to sell it in our city...

470
00:21:44,833 --> 00:21:47,541
Our work will never
really be done.

471
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:53,000
Freeze! It's SEVEN-O!

472

[CRIMINAL 13A]
Uh!

head and get down on the ground.

00:21:56,666 --> 00:21:57,916
And also.

475
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,875
Tell me what you think has
been the greatest moment

476
00:21:59,958 --> 00:22:02,916
in your life up till now.
Spare no details.

477
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,041
[KIRILL] Yep. This is a story
about ordinary detectives,

478
00:22:06,125 --> 00:22:08,458
working a beat in
a particular city.

479
00:22:08,541 --> 00:22:10,958
Brave men and women who
are willing to risk their lives

480
00:22:11,041 --> 00:22:12,458
in the line of duty

481
00:22:12,541 --> 00:22:14,625
[NARRATOR] Wrong! This is
a story about detectives, sure.

482
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:17,000
But it's also a story about
a group of heroes.

483
00:22:17,083 --> 00:22:20,041
People who saved the world from
disaster, the true magnitude

484
00:22:20,125 --> 00:22:23,500
of which they themselves didn't
even fully understand.

485
00:23:56,291 --> 00:23:58,208
[SOLDIER 13A] We've lost all
contact with Cooper.

486
00:23:58,291 --> 00:24:01,583
[SOLDIER 13B] I see. Well,
I can't say I'm surprised.

487
00:24:01,666 --> 00:24:05,083
He is the weakest of all
our 144 enhanced soldiers.

488
00:24:05,166 --> 00:24:07,250
[NARRATOR]
That's too many, man!
