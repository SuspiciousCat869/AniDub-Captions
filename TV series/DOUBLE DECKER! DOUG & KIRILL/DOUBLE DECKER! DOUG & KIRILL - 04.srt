00:07:22,583 --> 00:07:24,916
Well, this screw-up is your
responsibility, Rookie.

160
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,333
I'm sorry, I--

161
00:07:26,416 --> 00:07:28,041
I'm willing to ignore the
fact that you're useless.

162
00:07:28,125 --> 00:07:29,416
But, look,

163
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,291
like hell am I gonna let you
mess with my game here!

164
00:07:31,375 --> 00:07:34,000
I've got my own way
of handling things!

165
00:07:34,083 --> 00:07:35,125
Ugh!

166
00:07:36,708 --> 00:07:39,458
[DOUG] Your position's
not wrong, technically.

167
00:07:41,458 --> 00:07:44,583
[KAY] Yeah, but, she's not here,
so she must be super mad.

168
00:07:44,666 --> 00:07:45,916
Did she tell you about it?

169
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,541
"Thank you all for being here.

170
00:07:47,625 --> 00:07:49,666
I am honored to have joined
your ranks, and I hope..."

171
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:51,375
We bugging you?

172
00:07:51,458 --> 00:07:53,333
[KIRILL]
No, just practicing my speech.

173
00:07:53,416 --> 00:07:54,875
[MAXINE] Well, I'm sorry
your welcome party

174
00:07:54,958 --> 00:07:57,166
turned out to be such a lame
one, that really sucks.

175
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:58,291
But don't take it personally.

176
00:07:58,375 --> 00:07:59,708
Huh?!

177
00:07:59,791 --> 00:08:03,041
[DOUG] Listen, you don't really
have to make a speech.

178
00:08:03,125 --> 00:08:04,125
[DOUG laughing]

179
00:08:04,208 --> 00:08:08,583
[KIRILL growls]

180
00:08:12,166 --> 00:08:13,833
[KAY]
We're just not a good fit!

181
00:08:13,916 --> 00:08:16,000
She and I are
complete opposites.

182
00:08:16,083 --> 00:08:17,333
[KIRILL]
Huh...?

183
00:08:17,416 --> 00:08:19,625
And I'm not just takin'
about what happened today.

184
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:21,166
'Cause, like, last time.

185
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:23,333
[DEANA]
Doug! Lotz confirmed it.

186
00:08:23,416 --> 00:08:25,083
The bastard gave Anthem to Glen,

187
00:08:25,166 --> 00:08:27,916
the prisoner who
started the riot.

188
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,375
He's crying now and
spilling his guts.

189
00:08:30,458 --> 00:08:31,583
Now, sweet stuff,

190
00:08:31,666 --> 00:08:35,125
let's hear what else
you've got to tell us.

191
00:08:35,208 --> 00:08:37,958
And what's up with her
slutty outfit, anyway?

192
00:08:38,041 --> 00:08:41,000
It's a damn dress
code violation!

193
00:08:44,791 --> 00:08:46,000
[MAXINE]
Yeah, but, so what?

194
00:08:46,083 --> 00:08:48,125
It's Travis that lets
her get away with it.

195
00:08:48,208 --> 00:08:51,416
She is one of "Travis'
Angels," after all.

196
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,375
[DOUG]
Let her wear what she wants.

197
00:08:53,458 --> 00:08:56,000
Sometimes that's what
dangerous sting work calls for.

198
00:08:56,083 --> 00:08:58,541
She volunteered to
do undercover stuff,

199
00:08:58,625 --> 00:09:01,000
in exchange for not
getting a partner.

200
00:09:01,083 --> 00:09:02,791
She's spent a lot of
time figuring out

201
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:04,208
how to survive in that scene.

202
00:09:04,291 --> 00:09:06,666
The clothes are part
of her system.

203
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:07,958
[DEANA]
Look, if you even dream about

204
00:09:08,041 --> 00:09:09,125
half-assing this thing,

205
00:09:09,208 --> 00:09:12,583
you're gonna end up
on the menu, got it?

206
00:09:12,666 --> 00:09:15,875
Huh? You're allowed to
decline having a partner?

207
00:09:15,958 --> 00:09:17,958
If you're as talented
as she is, yeah.

208
00:09:18,041 --> 00:09:19,166
I'm confused.

209
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:21,541
Why did Deana agree to
work with Kay, then?

210
00:09:21,625 --> 00:09:22,791
It's weird.

211
00:09:22,875 --> 00:09:24,875
She turned down everyone
else, but took you on.

212
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:26,958
[KAY] I heard I was a
replacement for somebody else,

213
00:09:27,041 --> 00:09:28,375
so maybe that's what happened.

214
00:09:28,458 --> 00:09:29,666
If you mean Jefferson,

215
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:32,500
he was just some guy
that Travis forced on us.

216
00:09:32,583 --> 00:09:34,708
So, then, why did she
agree to work with me?

217
00:09:34,791 --> 00:09:37,583
Maybe you've got some quality
she knows she lacks.

218
00:09:37,666 --> 00:09:39,833
Something she thought
would help her.

219
00:09:39,916 --> 00:09:41,208
Okay!

220
00:09:41,291 --> 00:09:43,083
I'm gonna stick it out with
her a little bit longer,

221
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:45,541
keep doing my best,
and see what happens.

222
00:09:45,625 --> 00:09:47,750
And I'll take full
responsibility for everything

223
00:09:47,833 --> 00:09:49,916
that went down with
the botched sting today.

224
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,125
Huh?!

225
00:09:51,208 --> 00:09:53,708
[KIRILL] Responsibility?
You sure about that?

226
00:09:53,791 --> 00:09:54,875
I am.

227
00:09:54,958 --> 00:09:56,916
And I have an idea
that just might work.

228
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,458
[DEANA] "Responsibility?"
Responsibility for what?!

229
00:10:00,541 --> 00:10:03,208
Please! What's the problem
with hanging a suspect

230
00:10:03,291 --> 00:10:04,583
upside down for questioning?!

231
00:10:04,666 --> 00:10:05,916
Come on, it's unethical!

232
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,791
Due process and all
that, you know?

233
00:10:07,875 --> 00:10:09,916
[DEANA] Screw those
bleeding heart rules!

234
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,083
Are we children?!

235
00:10:11,166 --> 00:10:12,791
It's not like this
is anything new.

236
00:10:12,875 --> 00:10:14,500
We're a special breed.

237
00:10:14,583 --> 00:10:15,916
We're detectives,

238
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,791
but we're also in constant
danger of being disavowed

239
00:10:17,875 --> 00:10:20,166
and shut down by men
who sit behind desks.

240
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:22,916
We're kind of like
spies, in a way.

241
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,250
That's why Travis is so adamant
about everyone havin' a partner.

242
00:10:26,333 --> 00:10:28,166
He thinks it's a sort
of insurance plan,

243
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:31,791
a way to keep us safe out
in the field, and I agree.

244
00:10:31,875 --> 00:10:34,416
It works. The Double
Decker system.

245
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,291
[DEANA]
Ugh, enough. Cringe worthy.

246
00:10:36,375 --> 00:10:39,041
You know it's a good
idea, just admit it.

247
00:10:39,125 --> 00:10:40,458
[DEANA blows raspberry]

248
00:10:40,541 --> 00:10:42,000
[DERICK] And it's not without
additional perks, too.

249
00:10:42,083 --> 00:10:44,583
You can do half the work
and get twice the credit.

250
00:10:44,666 --> 00:10:45,583
[DEANA]
Even with a prissy

251
00:10:45,666 --> 00:10:47,833
goody-two-shoes
partner like her?

252
00:10:47,916 --> 00:10:50,500
[DERICK] I think she's exactly
the type of sidekick you need.

253
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:52,041
A perfect foil for you.

254
00:10:52,125 --> 00:10:54,416
[DEANA] It's a whole lot
faster if we go this way.

255
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:56,625
Don't be such a scaredy-cat!

256
00:10:57,958 --> 00:11:01,208
[sighs] To find the fastest
route from point A to point B,

257
00:11:01,291 --> 00:11:03,750
it's better if you
just go it alone.

258
00:11:03,833 --> 00:11:04,833
Hey, Derick?

259
00:11:04,916 --> 00:11:05,916
[DERICK]
Hm?

260
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
[DEANA]
It's bugging me.

261
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:09,083
Why'd you really quit the force?

262
00:11:09,166 --> 00:11:12,083
[DERICK] Hm. Honestly,
it really wasn't anything

263
00:11:12,166 --> 00:11:13,875
too big or dramatic.

264
00:11:16,833 --> 00:11:19,166
That's about the size of it.

265
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:21,833
[DEANA laughs]
So stupid,

266
00:11:21,916 --> 00:11:24,083
but you sure had me freaked
out for a second there.

267
00:11:24,166 --> 00:11:25,083
Uh!

268
00:11:25,166 --> 00:11:26,916
Although, I am
relieved it wasn't

269
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,500
because of the whole
Esperanza thing.

270
00:11:29,583 --> 00:11:31,208
Thanks. I guess.

271
00:11:31,291 --> 00:11:33,625
[DEANA] You're a dog lover,
aren't you, D?

272
00:11:33,708 --> 00:11:34,708
This is for you.

273
00:11:34,791 --> 00:11:36,083
[DERICK gasping]

274
00:11:36,166 --> 00:11:39,375
[DEANA] I made it yesterday.
It's a bar-warming gift.

275
00:11:39,458 --> 00:11:40,666
[DERICK]
Uh?

276
00:11:45,708 --> 00:11:47,166
[GARY]
So, you got it, huh?

277
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:49,375
The rookie spot in SEVEN-O.

278
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:52,833
Well, I'm proud that it's
one of my students, at least.

279
00:11:52,916 --> 00:11:54,500
Your good grades paid off.

280
00:11:54,583 --> 00:11:56,916
I've always wanted to work
over there, truth be told.

281
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,041
So, uh, sir?

282
00:11:58,125 --> 00:12:00,208
About the narcotics
seized yesterday.

283
00:12:00,291 --> 00:12:01,333
Of course.

284
00:12:01,416 --> 00:12:03,250
The lab tests found
illegal compounds.

285
00:12:03,333 --> 00:12:05,541
I thought they would.
I was right.

286
00:12:05,625 --> 00:12:07,833
Why don't you take us
to that club now.

287
00:12:07,916 --> 00:12:09,541
We'll launch our
own investigation

288
00:12:09,625 --> 00:12:11,000
and corroborate your intel.

289
00:12:11,083 --> 00:12:12,791
It's protocol, don't worry.

290
00:12:12,875 --> 00:12:14,041
I'm sorry.

291
00:12:14,125 --> 00:12:15,666
I know it's weird,
coming to you.

292
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:18,458
It's not weird at all,
kid, no sweat.

293
00:12:18,541 --> 00:12:20,458
I'll be sure to set
things up so nobody ends up

294
00:12:20,541 --> 00:12:23,541
stepping on anybody else's toes.

295
00:12:23,625 --> 00:12:25,083
The most important
thing to remember

296
00:12:25,166 --> 00:12:28,833
in any undercover operation
is to always act naturally.

297
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:33,291
[gasps] That's the guy.

298
00:12:34,791 --> 00:12:36,916
Let's go, then.

299
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,916
Sometimes it pays off
to be a little bold.

300
00:12:46,083 --> 00:12:47,541
I knew it, Anthem!

301
00:12:47,625 --> 00:12:50,250
Right. Whelp, sorry,
this is a trap.

302
00:12:50,333 --> 00:12:52,000
[KAY]
Huh? [screams]

303
00:12:52,083 --> 00:12:53,458
[KAY groans]

304
00:12:54,708 --> 00:12:57,125
Being bold almost
never pays off.

305
00:12:57,208 --> 00:12:59,125
And you've failed
me as a student.

306
00:12:59,208 --> 00:13:01,041
So naive.

307
00:13:08,125 --> 00:13:09,625
[DEANA] I'm in the middle
of something, Max.

308
00:13:09,708 --> 00:13:11,208
Make it quick.

309
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:14,958
Huh? Fine, I'll call
you back in a bit.

310
00:13:15,833 --> 00:13:17,583
So, show me the body.

311
00:13:17,666 --> 00:13:19,125
[MALE COP 4A]
Right this way.

312
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:21,708
[GARY]
You seem confused.

313
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:23,083
You still don't
get what this is?

314
00:13:23,166 --> 00:13:24,375

--Uh?!
--[engine revs]

474
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:51,625
SEVEN-O, here.

475
00:19:52,416 --> 00:19:55,291
Did you really believe
we were hostages?

476
00:19:55,375 --> 00:19:56,458
Come on, are you kidding?

477
00:19:56,541 --> 00:19:58,625
I was just trying to
keep you busy, girl.

478
00:19:58,708 --> 00:20:00,875
[exhales]

479
00:20:00,958 --> 00:20:02,375
[KIRILL]
So, this is why Deana told us

480
00:20:02,458 --> 00:20:04,291
not to take our eyes off Kay.

481
00:20:04,375 --> 00:20:07,666
And these two. Travis's Angels.

482
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:09,958
Wait, why are you
even here, exactly?

483
00:20:10,041 --> 00:20:12,958
[KIRILL] Huh? Oh, Doug thought I
should come along for the ride.

484
00:20:13,041 --> 00:20:16,166
He said it would be a learning
opportunity for the two of us.

485
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:18,750
Hold on. Where
is Doug, anyway?

486
00:20:19,916 --> 00:20:21,750
[DEANA] Looks like these
guys are all done here.

487
00:20:21,833 --> 00:20:23,916
How'd you know
it was a set-up?

488
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,791
[DEANA] Yuri told me that you
had gone back to the club

489
00:20:25,875 --> 00:20:28,041
with a detective from
the Drug Control Division.

490
00:20:28,125 --> 00:20:30,041
Max caught on pretty fast.

491
00:20:30,125 --> 00:20:31,875
Then, when I found
out it was Gary--

492
00:20:31,958 --> 00:20:34,875
I told them not to take
their eyes off you.

493
00:20:34,958 --> 00:20:38,541
That guy... We used to work
together back in the day.

494
00:20:38,625 --> 00:20:40,041
He had a stellar record,

495
00:20:40,125 --> 00:20:41,875
but there was something
off about him.

496
00:20:41,958 --> 00:20:43,750
When the position at
SEVEN-O opened up,

497
00:20:43,833 --> 00:20:45,500
Gary was the first to apply.

498
00:20:45,583 --> 00:20:46,875
But, then...

499
00:20:46,958 --> 00:20:49,375
[ANTHEM] Why would they ever
pick someone like you?

500
00:20:49,458 --> 00:20:51,083
[DEANA] Travis said Gary
was too attached

501
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:53,166
to his sense of right and wrong.

502
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:55,875
[KAY]
Deana? Is it always like this?

503
00:20:55,958 --> 00:20:57,208
[DEANA]
Yeah.

504
00:20:57,291 --> 00:20:59,208
It's just my way of doing
things. Don't like it--

505
00:20:59,291 --> 00:21:01,083
[KAY] I want you to teach me
everything you know!

506
00:21:01,166 --> 00:21:02,208
Huh?

507
00:21:04,541 --> 00:21:06,208
[KAY] But the rules
are still the rules,

508
00:21:06,291 --> 00:21:09,791
and I won't compromise on that!

509
00:21:09,875 --> 00:21:11,416
Here I thought you only
had the same name

510
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:12,958
as my former partner,

511
00:21:13,041 --> 00:21:14,791
but you've got the
same personality.

512
00:21:14,875 --> 00:21:16,250
[KAY]
Huh? Partner?

513
00:21:16,333 --> 00:21:17,375
When was this?

514
00:21:17,458 --> 00:21:18,958
Why didn't I hear
about it before now?

515
00:21:19,041 --> 00:21:22,625
I don't think that's any of
your business, now, is it?

516
00:21:22,708 --> 00:21:24,583
[DEANA]
It's not a big deal!

517
00:21:24,666 --> 00:21:27,458
Why do you hafta be
such a worry wart, Kay?

518
00:21:27,541 --> 00:21:28,750
Ha!

519
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:34,750
[MAXINE] I think she's
talking about a dog.

520
00:21:34,833 --> 00:21:35,500
Huh?

521
00:21:35,583 --> 00:21:36,750
I mean,

522
00:21:36,833 --> 00:21:39,041
I'm pretty sure Deana's
old dog was named Kay.

523
00:21:39,125 --> 00:21:40,541
That's why she jumped
at the chance

524
00:21:40,625 --> 00:21:42,625
to take Rookie on.

525
00:21:42,708 --> 00:21:43,666
A dog?

526
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:45,166
[DEANA]
What are you doing? Come on!

527
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:46,625
Uh. Coming!

528
00:21:46,708 --> 00:21:47,458
Slow ass.

529
00:21:47,541 --> 00:21:48,291
[KAY]
I'm sorry.

530
00:21:48,375 --> 00:21:49,541
Hey. Bark like a dog for me.

531
00:21:49,625 --> 00:21:50,791
[KAY]
No, way, weirdo!

532
00:21:50,875 --> 00:21:52,750
Seems like they'll make
a good team after all.

533
00:21:52,833 --> 00:21:54,500
Sometimes opposites do attract.

534
00:21:54,583 --> 00:21:57,375
Yeah. And him? How's
that been working out?

535
00:21:57,458 --> 00:21:58,208
[DOUG]
Hm?

536
00:21:58,291 --> 00:22:00,500
[growling]

537
00:22:00,583 --> 00:22:02,291
Why didn't you come
save me, Doug?

538
00:22:02,375 --> 00:22:04,000
We're supposed to be a team!

539
00:22:04,083 --> 00:22:06,500
Oh, I figured you'd be
okay with Yuri there.

540
00:22:06,583 --> 00:22:07,958
I turned out to be right, too.

541
00:22:08,041 --> 00:22:09,375
So rude.

542
00:22:09,458 --> 00:22:11,583
Oh, I forgot! Yuri!

543
00:22:11,666 --> 00:22:15,333
Listen, don't tell anybody
I said this, but...

544
00:22:15,416 --> 00:22:20,166
About Yuri. I think... she
might actually be a robot.

545
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:22,166
[NARRATOR] It's public
knowledge that Yuri is,

546
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:24,000
indeed, actually a robot.

547
00:22:24,083 --> 00:22:25,000
However...

548
00:22:25,083 --> 00:22:27,208
[DOUG]
No way. That's impossible!

549
00:22:27,291 --> 00:22:28,875
[KIRILL] I don't have
definitive proof yet,

550
00:22:28,958 --> 00:22:29,916
so don't spread it around.

551
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,833
Got it. I won't tell a soul.

552
00:22:31,916 --> 00:22:33,083
[NARRATOR]
That's right!

553
00:22:33,166 --> 00:22:36,375
Doug is, indeed,
actually an asshole!

554
00:22:36,458 --> 00:22:38,000
[DOUG] I'll keep an
eye out for evidence.

555
00:22:38,083 --> 00:22:40,500
[KIRILL] Thanks.
You're the best, partner!

556
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:12,916
[NARRATOR A] Now that
you've learned that Doug

557
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,708
is a big-time asshole, you
know pretty much everything

558
00:24:15,791 --> 00:24:18,250
you'd ever need to know about
the characters in this story.

559
00:24:18,333 --> 00:24:20,958
Good! Now things
can really get moving!

560
00:24:21,041 --> 00:24:22,500
Next time, on <i>Double Decker</i> !

561
00:24:22,583 --> 00:24:24,416
Episode five: "A. Kroyd Killer!"

562
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:26,250
Don't be late, jerks!
