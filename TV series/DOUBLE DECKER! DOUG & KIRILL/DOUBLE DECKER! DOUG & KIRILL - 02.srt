[KIRILL] Now's my chance
to become a hero!

00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:35,500
This is SEVEN-O!

For those of you just tuning in,

That's a woman.

And this is a story
about heroes.

12
00:00:44,458 --> 00:00:46,125
Just kidding. It's not!

13
00:00:46,208 --> 00:00:47,875
It's a story about detectives,

14

who wouldn't have jobs if it
weren't for your tax dollars!

15
00:02:23,083 --> 00:02:26,000
[KIRILL] About a week before
the events you just witnessed,

16
00:02:26,083 --> 00:02:29,708
I became a detective and
received my first codename,

17
00:02:29,791 --> 00:02:31,166
and my second.

18
00:02:33,291 --> 00:02:37,291
[KIRILL] I'd taken my first step
toward becoming a hero, when...

00:02:37,375 --> 00:02:38,958
[TRAVIS]
I'm sorry, Okappa.

20
00:02:39,041 --> 00:02:40,250
But you're fired.

[gasps]

22
00:02:41,583 --> 00:02:44,583
[KIRILL] The next day,
everything fell apart.

23
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:47,458
[KIRILL]
W-Wait. I-I don't understand.

24
00:02:47,541 --> 00:02:49,000
What did I do wrong?

25
00:02:49,083 --> 00:02:50,375
I made a mistake.

26
00:02:50,458 --> 00:02:52,458
We had one open slot, not two.

27
00:02:52,541 --> 00:02:55,250
And unfortunately, that
position was meant for Kay.

28
00:02:55,333 --> 00:02:57,625
So, you were never really
supposed to be here.

29
00:02:57,708 --> 00:02:58,458

00:02:59,875 --> 00:03:01,291
It's not going to work out.

00:03:01,375 --> 00:03:03,083
Maybe your old job's
still open, though.

Come on! You can't be serious
right now. I just--

34
00:03:05,791 --> 00:03:08,125
[TRAVIS] The real victim
in all this is me.

35
00:03:08,208 --> 00:03:10,333
I'm not saying that you
aren't suffering too, but

36
00:03:10,416 --> 00:03:13,708
a mistake like this will very
likely cost me a promotion.

37

[NARRATOR] As he absorbed his
erstwhile supervisor's less

40
00:03:19,708 --> 00:03:22,458

Kirill thought to himself:

41
00:03:22,541 --> 00:03:24,500
[KIRILL]
"I know! This must be a trial

42
00:03:24,583 --> 00:03:28,625
laid out for me by the
god of heroes himself!"

43
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:30,083
I understand now, sir.

44
00:03:30,166 --> 00:03:31,083
[TRAVIS]
Hm?

45
00:03:31,166 --> 00:03:32,666
I'd like you to give
me one week.

46
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:34,833
If I can't accomplish
anything during that time,

47
00:03:34,916 --> 00:03:36,125
I'll gladly leave.

48
00:03:36,208 --> 00:03:37,708
You won't see me again.

49
00:03:37,791 --> 00:03:40,083
However, if I do manage
to prove myself,

50
00:03:40,166 --> 00:03:43,041
I want you to consider keeping
me here in SEVEN-O.

51
00:03:43,125 --> 00:03:46,583
Surely your bosses can be
persuaded to add a slot.

52
00:03:48,583 --> 00:03:49,625
[NARRATOR]
That's right!

53
00:03:49,708 --> 00:03:51,541
He's an idiot!

54
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,125
[NARRATOR]
Too late, Kirill realized,

55
00:03:56,208 --> 00:03:59,125
there was no way his boss
would accept this proposal.

56
00:03:59,208 --> 00:04:02,000
Why would he? There was
nothing in it for him.

57
00:04:02,083 --> 00:04:03,375
But then...

58
00:04:03,458 --> 00:04:06,375
Mm... Fine. If you manage
to impress me,

59
00:04:06,458 --> 00:04:07,500
I'll consider it.

60

That's right!

00:04:11,416 --> 00:04:14,000
Great, another moron
to deal with.

67
00:04:22,875 --> 00:04:24,250
Or so I thought.

68
00:04:24,333 --> 00:04:26,083
But, then...

69
00:04:27,833 --> 00:04:31,250
Where did all the crime go?

Meetings, paperwork, training,
paperwork, overtime, paperwork.

I thought a detective's
job would be exciting,

a bunch of boring deskwork.

And when we did
get called out...

Honestly, how could you
be such a total moron?

He's got a look on his face

As far as I know, Billy's

He's out of prison now,

[DOUG] Anthem's gotten

in the last few years.

182

And since it's so much riskier
to handle than other drugs,

a lot of money off of it.

hoping to make a fortune,
only to have it ruin their life.

If things had turned
out differently,

then that could have
been my story.

Well, we were orphans.

Who is "we"?

193
00:09:29,125 --> 00:09:31,708
I grew up with my older
sister, but she disappeared

194
00:09:31,791 --> 00:09:34,166
a decade ago, and I
haven't seen her since.

Huh?

197
00:09:36,666 --> 00:09:38,250
That's the whole reason
I became a cop.

198
00:09:38,333 --> 00:09:40,083
Because I wanted
to look for her.

199
00:09:40,166 --> 00:09:41,833
I needed more information,

200
00:09:41,916 --> 00:09:44,625
and that's how I started
working with Morgan.

201

But, it turns out that this job
isn't exactly what I expected.

202

I always figured that I
would have more freedom

my way up to detective.

to say, but honestly,

A riot has broken out at

One guard has been wounded.

The man believed to have
incited the riot

is one Henry Glen, who
was serving a life term.

229
00:10:52,458 --> 00:10:55,458
It's possible that Glen had help
from inside the prison system,

but we cannot yet confirm it.

How's a drug responsible

[DOUG]
It is. Like any drug,

259
00:12:07,666 --> 00:12:09,958
it gives you a sense of
omnipotence and pleasure,

00:12:10,041 --> 00:12:11,916

it removes all your
natural limiters.

The escapees are probably

I'm guessing they swam.

It's simple, really.

The tides would take you
right to the warehouse

that informant told you about.

Those containers
in the warehouse.

If your guy was right, those
were most likely placed there

to smuggle the prisoners out
after they'd escaped the island.

Our job is to focus

Here's what I'm thinking.

323
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:32,125
Glen used the gang at the
warehouse as a decoy,

324
00:14:32,208 --> 00:14:35,458
and chose a simpler and more
certain route to escape.

[KIRILL]
Thanks. Sorry to bother you.

All right, the injured are
definitely prison guards.

I checked their IDs and made
sure their fingerprints matched.

Of course, Glen
could've gotten away,

It's Overdrive.

Resulting in that handsome face.

Why didn't he just escape
with the others?

See, the thing about Anthem

359
00:16:12,291 --> 00:16:14,541
is that it alters
the human genome.

360

So, sometimes it can
induce rapid evolution.

00:21:43,833 --> 00:21:46,041
This is your uniform and
accessories, obviously.

478
00:21:46,125 --> 00:21:47,625
Huh? I don't understand.

479
00:21:47,708 --> 00:21:49,750
I barely accomplished
anything this past week.

480
00:21:49,833 --> 00:21:52,833
Huh? Oh.

481
00:21:52,916 --> 00:21:55,125
Oh. Yeah, you're right.

482
00:21:55,208 --> 00:21:58,166
But, still. In the end,
I guess it was okay.

483
00:21:58,250 --> 00:21:59,041
[KIRILL gasps]

484
00:21:59,125 --> 00:22:01,500
A lot happened. And, well,

485
00:22:01,583 --> 00:22:03,875
I guess you don't
suck too badly.

486
00:22:03,958 --> 00:22:06,458
Uh, good.

487
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:10,666
[TRAVIS] Hm... People will
probably think you're a girl

488
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:13,583
if we keep calling you Okappa.

489
00:22:13,666 --> 00:22:14,833
I know!

490
00:22:14,916 --> 00:22:18,916
From now on, your code
name will be Buzz-Cut!

491
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,291
Hey, Buzz-Cut. Lookin' good.

492
00:22:21,375 --> 00:22:22,791

[NARRATOR]
And so, in the end,

494
00:22:26,416 --> 00:22:29,791
I guess Kirill didn't suck too
badly, because he was now an

495
00:22:29,875 --> 00:22:34,041
official member of the Special
Crime Investigation Unit.

496
00:22:34,125 --> 00:22:36,791
Thus, clad in a
shiny new uniform,

497
00:22:36,875 --> 00:22:40,791
Kirill took another step on the
path toward becomin' a hero.

498
00:24:12,541 --> 00:24:15,416
[NARRATOR] Kirill begins his
new life as Detective Buzz-Cut,

499
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:19,125
and for the first time ever, he
faces the prospect of romance.

500
00:24:19,208 --> 00:24:20,833
Or maybe not, actually.

Partner's Partner!"

503
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,166
