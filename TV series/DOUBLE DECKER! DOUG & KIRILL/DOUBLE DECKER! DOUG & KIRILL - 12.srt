At this rate, I think I'd

We should strike now,

I've just received a report.

A large number of
bodies were found

43
00:03:34,625 --> 00:03:37,458
at a well-known crime scene.

44
00:03:37,541 --> 00:03:39,958
It seems that every cadaver
was a high-ranking member

45
00:03:40,041 --> 00:03:42,166
of Esperanza. Some
people seem to think

46
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:46,000
it's indicative of mutiny, or
some other internal struggle.

But we don't have
any proof of that yet.

for this department.

And that's all I can say
on the matter at this time.

So, that's why you're
all being put on leave.

What he said about mutiny

61
00:04:17,166 --> 00:04:19,333
or internal conflict
is probably true.

for higher-ups to suspect us.

Especially with what
happened to Yuri.

about the human
civilization living

on one of
our suns, Nikai.

to the colony.

All humans on our planet
have a missing genetic link,

and, while researching
this genomic difference,

No. They're still human.

They left Earth when
it was uninhabitable

120
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:46,041
and sought a new home
in the sky centuries ago.

You, the folks of Nikai,
descended from those humans.

Nothing surprises me.

So, the military wants
him but not you?

I wish I knew the reason.

I suppose Kirill is different
than me in some way.

Apparently, he's special,
or so they tell me.

Now, then.

138

I'm sure you've been wondering
what makes you so special.

139
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:34,375
The people of the
Nikai civilization

140
00:07:34,458 --> 00:07:36,666
have a unique set of problems.

141
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:39,166
While they managed to find
a new home in space,

142
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:41,708
it turned out to be a
place unlike any other.

143
00:07:41,791 --> 00:07:44,666
One with its own,
strange order and conflicts.

144
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:46,958
The other side of those
struggles outnumbered us,

145
00:07:47,041 --> 00:07:50,041
so we decided to enhance
every individual human soldier

146
00:07:50,125 --> 00:07:53,125
with powerful drugs as a way
to even the score.

Hold on a second.

have forgotten.

of data necessary

[gasps] What are you saying?

475
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:39,250
Don't you think that's
way too reckless, Doug?

476
00:20:39,333 --> 00:20:41,500
You'll just have to cure
me with your antibodies.

477
00:20:41,583 --> 00:20:42,958
I'll be fine.

478
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:44,875
But what happens if you die
before I get the chance?!

479
00:20:44,958 --> 00:20:47,083
It would be a hell of a lot
better than sitting here,

480
00:20:47,166 --> 00:20:50,416
waiting to die,
like some lame coward.

481
00:20:53,458 --> 00:20:55,750
[MAXINE]
Everybody, quick! That way!

482
00:20:56,916 --> 00:20:58,500
[MAXINE]
You think Doug'll be all right?

483
00:20:58,583 --> 00:21:00,041
[DEANA]
I think there's no other way.

484
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:02,750
Reckless or not,
we have no choice.

485
00:21:02,833 --> 00:21:04,625
But it's such a big risk.

486
00:21:04,708 --> 00:21:05,958
If we lose him...

487
00:21:06,041 --> 00:21:07,625
[DEANA]
Max.

488
00:21:07,708 --> 00:21:09,916
You told me revenge
wouldn't bring Yuri back,

489
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,791
and you were right about that.

490
00:21:11,875 --> 00:21:15,000
I knew it was true
even before you said it.

491
00:21:15,083 --> 00:21:18,583
But, what we're doing
here isn't just revenge.

492
00:21:18,666 --> 00:21:21,750
We're avenging Yuri, sure, but
it's about a lot more than that.

493
00:21:21,833 --> 00:21:23,833
That (bleep) deserves to have
his saggy ball (bleep)

494
00:21:23,916 --> 00:21:26,416
twisted around and
shoved up his (bleep).

495
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:28,041
(bleep) yeah!

496
00:21:28,125 --> 00:21:30,541
[NARRATOR] I think what Deana
is trying to say here is,

497
00:21:30,625 --> 00:21:32,041
"Let's do our best, guys!"

498
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:34,083
[KIRILL] That plan is never
gonna work, Doug!

499
00:21:34,166 --> 00:21:35,250
It's too dangerous!

500
00:21:35,333 --> 00:21:37,250
[DOUG]
I wish there was another way.

501
00:21:37,333 --> 00:21:40,166
I need you to trust me. Can you?

502
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:41,291
[gasps]

503
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:44,875
[creaking]

504
00:21:44,958 --> 00:21:46,375
[COOPER]
Show yourself, Kirill!

505
00:21:46,458 --> 00:21:48,250
[DOUG, KIRILL gasp]

506
00:21:48,333 --> 00:21:49,875
Just drop your weapons,

507
00:21:49,958 --> 00:21:53,208
your Anthem, and that special
drug your friends brought.

508
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,333
I never even suspected
that Zabel would stoop

509
00:21:57,416 --> 00:21:58,541
to working for SEVEN-O.

510
00:21:58,625 --> 00:21:59,708
[grunts]

511
00:21:59,791 --> 00:22:01,875
[COOPER ]
I have some bad news, though.

512
00:22:01,958 --> 00:22:03,583
I've been chatting
with Valery here,

513
00:22:03,666 --> 00:22:06,291
who told me everything I
needed to know on the subject.

514
00:22:06,375 --> 00:22:07,791
Milla. But why?

515
00:22:07,875 --> 00:22:10,333
I'm sorry, Kirill, and Doug!

516
00:22:10,416 --> 00:22:13,500
I followed you 'cause I was
tired of feeling helpless!

517
00:22:13,583 --> 00:22:17,208
Kirill Vrubel. It appears
that your very existence

518
00:22:17,291 --> 00:22:19,500
brings with it a sizeable
collection of perils.

519
00:22:19,583 --> 00:22:21,041
[KIRILL grunts]

520
00:22:21,125 --> 00:22:24,000
[COOPER] I suppose we of the
Nikai faction were always aware

521
00:22:24,083 --> 00:22:27,375
of the risk that your antibodies
might fall into enemy hands.

522
00:22:27,458 --> 00:22:29,500
But I never imagined
anyone here on Earth

523
00:22:29,583 --> 00:22:31,666
would beat me to the punch.

524
00:22:32,916 --> 00:22:35,041
You're wasting everyone's time!

525
00:22:35,125 --> 00:22:36,541
Let Milla go right now.

526
00:22:36,625 --> 00:22:38,250
Kirill!

527
00:22:40,333 --> 00:22:43,750
I'm no use to you if I'm
dead, right? Cooper?

528
00:22:43,833 --> 00:22:45,916
That's quite enough,
Constable Vrubel.

529
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,375
Don't do anything stupid.

530
00:22:47,458 --> 00:22:49,958
[COOPER] Listen to your
partner, Kirill, he's right.

531
00:22:50,041 --> 00:22:52,208
Put down the gun and
come with me, quietly.

532
00:22:52,291 --> 00:22:53,541
If you do that,

533
00:22:53,625 --> 00:22:55,541
I guarantee they'll all
make it out of here alive.

534
00:22:55,625 --> 00:22:57,083
[KIRILL]
You listen to me!

535
00:22:57,166 --> 00:22:58,666
You've got ten seconds.

536
00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:00,375
Let Milla go or I'll
pull the trigger!

537
00:23:00,458 --> 00:23:01,000
[DOUG]
Vrubel!

538
00:23:01,083 --> 00:23:02,750
Ten... Nine...

539
00:23:02,833 --> 00:23:04,458
All I wanted was
something to present

540
00:23:04,541 --> 00:23:07,250
to my bosses up on Nikai,
but none of them have any idea

541
00:23:07,333 --> 00:23:08,958
whether you're dead
or alive right now.

542
00:23:09,041 --> 00:23:10,500
[KIRILL]
Four...

543
00:23:10,583 --> 00:23:13,125
To be perfectly honest, you're
nothing but a threat to me.

544
00:23:13,208 --> 00:23:14,625
If you were to die now

545
00:23:14,708 --> 00:23:18,250
it would actually make
my life a whole lot easier.

546
00:23:18,333 --> 00:23:19,833
Fine, then, Cooper.

547
00:23:19,916 --> 00:23:21,958
We'll do whatever you say.

548
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:24,458
Doug!

549
00:23:24,541 --> 00:23:26,500
You'd better go
with the Commander.

550
00:23:26,583 --> 00:23:31,208
We have no choice.
We've got to admit defeat.

551
00:23:36,625 --> 00:23:38,208
[KIRILL gasping]

552
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:40,791
[gunshot]

553
00:23:40,875 --> 00:23:42,958
[gasping]

554
00:23:46,375 --> 00:23:48,166
Heh.

555
00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:49,791
Doug!

556
00:23:50,291 --> 00:23:52,500
What a pair of fools you are.

557
00:23:52,583 --> 00:23:54,208
Do you think power
is easy to get?

558
00:23:54,291 --> 00:23:57,041
Something just anyone
can come by?

559
00:23:57,125 --> 00:23:58,500
[KIRILL growls]

560
00:24:01,666 --> 00:24:03,333
You've done enough, Cooper.

561
00:24:03,416 --> 00:24:06,833
We've lost! You don't
have to do any more!

562
00:24:06,916 --> 00:24:09,375
[chuckles]

563
00:24:12,125 --> 00:24:14,125
[NARRATOR] Kirill's rescue
is not going well!

564
00:24:14,208 --> 00:24:15,458
Will there be any
kind of future left

565
00:24:15,541 --> 00:24:17,125
for SEVEN-O when
this is all over?

566
00:24:17,208 --> 00:24:19,541
The hint was in the title
this whole time, people!

567
00:24:19,625 --> 00:24:22,041
Next time on <i>Double Decker</i> :
Episode Thirteen!

568
00:24:22,125 --> 00:24:24,666
"And Then There Weren't None!"
I know, a double negative!

569
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:26,250
Don't miss the last one, folks!
