Constable Vrubel!

00:00:25,666 --> 00:00:27,083
Huh?! Uh...

00:00:27,166 --> 00:00:28,583
Get us some coffee, would ya?

6
00:00:28,666 --> 00:00:30,333
Oh, sure.

00:00:30,416 --> 00:00:33,083
[NARRATOR] Idiot Buzz-Cut,
AKA Kirill Vrubel,

8
00:00:33,166 --> 00:00:34,875
is really out of it.

9
00:00:34,958 --> 00:00:37,541
What's he got on
his mind, I wonder.

10
00:00:37,625 --> 00:00:40,458
So, then. Any interest
in joining the military?

11
00:00:40,541 --> 00:00:42,291
Wait. What do you mean--

12
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:44,208
[COOPER]
I mean exactly what I said.

13
00:00:44,291 --> 00:00:47,250
I'm flattered, but, I only
just joined the SEVEN-O.

14
00:00:47,333 --> 00:00:48,916
[NARRATOR]
It was an incredible offer.

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,250
And the idea of joining
the Lisvalletta Military

16
00:00:51,333 --> 00:00:53,000
was certainly tempting.

17
00:00:53,083 --> 00:00:55,916
Want to be a real hero--
one who could save the world?

18
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,875
[NARRATOR]
Tempting, to say the least.

19
00:00:57,958 --> 00:01:00,250
[COOPER] I don't need
an answer right now.

20
00:01:00,333 --> 00:01:03,458
Although, I will say this much.

21
00:01:03,541 --> 00:01:05,208
You're not like the others.

22
00:01:05,291 --> 00:01:07,625
You're special, one of a kind.

23
00:01:07,708 --> 00:01:09,875
[KIRILL chuckles]
Special! One of a kind!

24
00:01:09,958 --> 00:01:11,041
[NARRATOR]
Scratch that!

25
00:01:11,125 --> 00:01:13,333
He'd basically made up
his mind already!

What are you feeling
all giddy about?

27
00:01:15,166 --> 00:01:18,000
Oh, uh. It's nothing. Uh.

28
00:01:18,083 --> 00:01:20,833
Don't tell me. You got a special
psychic power upgrade

at your last maintenance!

I'm just a robot, Kirill,
not a superhero.

31
00:01:24,875 --> 00:01:26,041
Heh. Gotcha.

32
00:01:26,125 --> 00:01:27,833
Travis, how 'bout you? Coffee?

33
00:01:27,916 --> 00:01:30,333
Uh? Muchas gracias.

34
00:01:31,458 --> 00:01:32,458
Huh...?

35
00:01:32,541 --> 00:01:33,541
[DOCTOR HOPE]
He forced me to do it!

36
00:01:33,625 --> 00:01:35,250
I didn't have any choice
in the matter!

37
00:01:35,333 --> 00:01:37,000
[DOUG]
And who is "he"?

38
00:01:37,083 --> 00:01:38,041
[DOCTOR HOPE]
It's Z.

39
00:01:38,125 --> 00:01:40,125
You know, Zabel Franken.

00:01:40,208 --> 00:01:42,833
[gasps] Zabel...

41
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:48,291
[ZABEL] The military wants
to crush Esperanza, do they?

42
00:01:48,375 --> 00:01:50,500
So, what do you think,
boss? What now?

43
00:01:50,583 --> 00:01:53,041
[ZABEL]
You know the answer to that.

44
00:01:53,125 --> 00:01:54,208
[chair legs scraping]

45
00:01:54,291 --> 00:01:55,583
[ZABEL]
Sit down!

46
00:01:55,666 --> 00:01:58,541
Don't you dare
disrespect the food.

47
00:03:32,916 --> 00:03:35,083
[NARRATOR] After the matter
with Hope and Esperanza,

48
00:03:35,166 --> 00:03:37,666
command of the operation
transferred to the military.

49
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:39,208
It marked the first time
in history

50
00:03:39,291 --> 00:03:40,750
that the Lisvalletta military

51
00:03:40,833 --> 00:03:43,791
had gotten heavily involved
in a civilian case.

52
00:03:43,875 --> 00:03:46,583
The armed forces expanded
the scope of the search,

53
00:03:46,666 --> 00:03:49,291
and employed every available
police officer in Lisvalletta

54
00:03:49,375 --> 00:03:52,416
to search all the university
hospitals in the area.

55
00:03:59,416 --> 00:04:01,000
[POLICE CHIEF 1A]
I understand.

56
00:04:01,083 --> 00:04:03,833
So, the downfall of that mayoral
candidate triggered all this?

57
00:04:03,916 --> 00:04:05,416
[TRAVIS]
Those pushing for legalization

58
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:07,208
were linked to Esperanza.

59
00:04:07,291 --> 00:04:09,541
And now the brass is making
an example out of them.

60
00:04:09,625 --> 00:04:12,833
Hmph. Esperanza's small
time for the military.

61
00:04:12,916 --> 00:04:14,125
Aren't you going to eat?

62
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:15,333
On a diet.

63
00:04:15,416 --> 00:04:17,375
My daughter's getting
married next month.

64
00:04:17,458 --> 00:04:18,916
Ah, when's the big day?

65
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,291
You're my old school buddy.

66
00:04:20,375 --> 00:04:22,416
I would love to send over
a nice bouquet.

67
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:23,750
Don't worry about my kid.

68
00:04:23,833 --> 00:04:25,833
You should focus on
your own idiot son.

69
00:04:25,916 --> 00:04:27,166
Wait, my son?

70
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:29,666
The military ordered me
to submit every available

71
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:33,000
piece of documentation we
had on one Kirill Vrubel.

72
00:04:33,083 --> 00:04:34,333
Are you mad?

73
00:04:34,416 --> 00:04:37,375
You had high hopes for him,
didn't you?

74
00:04:37,458 --> 00:04:38,750
[TRAVIS]
I'm not his father.

75
00:04:38,833 --> 00:04:41,583
Me and Buzz-Cut are more
like brothers, after all--

76
00:04:41,666 --> 00:04:42,833
as far as our looks go.

77
00:04:42,916 --> 00:04:44,125
Yeah, right. Sure.

78
00:04:44,208 --> 00:04:46,916
I suppose the choice
is his to make, anyway.

79

[KIRILL sighs] I hate having
to work so early in the morning!

00:04:50,583 --> 00:04:52,416
Eh, tell it to the military.

81
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,208
The whole thing
is total bullshit.

82
00:04:54,291 --> 00:04:55,833
All they do is bark
stupid orders,

83
00:04:55,916 --> 00:04:57,791
and they get paid three
times what we do.

84
00:04:57,875 --> 00:04:58,916
[KIRILL]
Three times?!

retirement, and
even a luxury car!

87
00:05:02,333 --> 00:05:03,583
A luxury car?

88
00:05:03,666 --> 00:05:05,958
And the cafeteria at their
headquarters is amazing:

89

free all-you-can-eat!

90
00:05:06,958 --> 00:05:08,250
Free all-you-can-eat?!

91
00:05:08,333 --> 00:05:10,166
And bad ass uniforms
on top of it all.

92
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:11,208
That's right!

to work for the military--

--I'd take it in a heartbeat.
--Yep! I wouldn't even hesitate!

Come on, guys.

99
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,916
It's time to get out of here.

100
00:05:34,958 --> 00:05:37,916
[KIRILL] I wanted to be a
detective more than anything.

101
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:44,625
[KIRILL]
But now that I've gotten exactly

102
00:05:44,708 --> 00:05:47,708
what I always wanted... I dunno.

103
00:05:47,791 --> 00:05:48,875
[KIRILL]
Huh?

104
00:05:50,458 --> 00:05:52,333
You should at least try to act
a little tired or something.

105
00:05:52,416 --> 00:05:54,458
They're all gonna know
you're a robot!

106
00:05:54,541 --> 00:05:56,583
I'll be careful.

107
00:05:56,666 --> 00:05:58,916
[KIRILL]
Huh? A hot spring?

108
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,166
I thought it'd be a great place

109
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:01,791
for me and Max to
go on vacation.

110

[DEANA]
Ooh, I adore hot springs!

111
00:06:03,833 --> 00:06:05,333
We should all take
a trip there together.

112
00:06:05,416 --> 00:06:06,416
Whaddaya think, Buzz-Cut?

113
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:07,708
Am I invited?

114
00:06:07,791 --> 00:06:09,875
Well, yeah. I said
everyone, didn't I?

115
00:06:09,958 --> 00:06:11,166
[MAXINE]
That's a great idea.

116
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:13,208
I guess we should invite
Derick and Apple, too.

117
00:06:13,291 --> 00:06:15,375
We should also invite Milla.

118
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:18,333
That's right. Detectives'
families are a part of the team!

Yeah, exactly.

120

Part of the team...

I hate to burst your bubble,
guys, but we can't all go!

Somebody's got to stay here
and man the fort!

Oh, calm down.

Anyway, if the investigation
keeps going on like it is,

00:06:29,291 --> 00:06:30,291
I have a feeling
we're gonna have

126

a ton of free time on our hands.

Do you really think so?

[DEANA]
Huh?

129
00:06:34,416 --> 00:06:36,458
An operation of this scale
will attract a lot of attention.

130
00:06:36,541 --> 00:06:38,625
That could amp things up
for us around here.

131
00:06:38,708 --> 00:06:39,750
All this case will do

132
00:06:39,833 --> 00:06:41,375
is increase public
awareness of Anthem.

133

Eh, who cares about that?

As long as Esperanza gets wiped
out, I'll deal with whatever.

When the government
shuts people down

136

it's bound to cause
a strain somewhere.

What are you talking about?

doing their jobs.

I kinda like it where I am.

00:07:43,916 --> 00:07:45,833
Which means, "the second floor."

[gasps]

162
00:07:47,041 --> 00:07:48,833
Have you ever heard
that name before?

163
00:07:48,916 --> 00:07:49,958
[MALE DRUNKARD 6A]
No! Farther up!

164
00:07:50,041 --> 00:07:52,458
Way, way, way farther up!

165
00:07:52,541 --> 00:07:53,375
The second floor.

166
00:07:53,458 --> 00:07:54,708
--"The second floor"?
--Huh?

167
00:07:54,791 --> 00:07:56,666
Yes. I have, actually.

168
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:59,583
But only from some drunk,
so I wrote it off as nonsense.

169
00:07:59,666 --> 00:08:01,583
[COOPER] There's a whole
civilization of humans

170
00:08:01,666 --> 00:08:04,125
living on Nikai with
an entirely different culture

171
00:08:04,208 --> 00:08:05,583
than any in our world.

172
00:08:05,666 --> 00:08:07,958
The military attempted to
make contact with them once,

173
00:08:08,041 --> 00:08:09,500
via covert operation,

174
00:08:09,583 --> 00:08:11,166
but they wanted nothing
to do with us.

175
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:15,041
Okay. But why are you
telling me this?

176
00:08:15,125 --> 00:08:18,541
[COOPER] Eighteen years ago, we
received remarkable information.

177
00:08:18,625 --> 00:08:22,041
Some children had escaped from
Nikai and made their way here.

178
00:08:22,125 --> 00:08:23,375
[KIRILL gasping]

179
00:08:23,458 --> 00:08:24,625
[COOPER] The military
has spent the better part

180
00:08:24,708 --> 00:08:25,708
of the last two decades

181
00:08:25,791 --> 00:08:27,291
trying to track those
children down.

182
00:08:27,375 --> 00:08:28,500
[KIRILL]
Really?

183
00:08:28,583 --> 00:08:29,666
When I heard you say
your good luck mantra

184
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:31,708
before rescuing your
partner, it clicked.

185
00:08:31,791 --> 00:08:34,125
So I decided to do
some research.

186
00:08:34,208 --> 00:08:35,291
Don't think, Kirill.

187
00:08:35,375 --> 00:08:37,791
Feel so good. Boo-yah!

188
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:40,375
[COOPER]
It's a line from a Nikai prayer,

189
00:08:40,458 --> 00:08:41,958
paraphrased slightly.

190
00:08:42,041 --> 00:08:44,458
I never could have imagined
finding you this way.

191
00:08:44,541 --> 00:08:45,833
[gasps] So, then...

192
00:08:45,916 --> 00:08:47,958
That's really why you
were scouting me?

193
00:08:48,041 --> 00:08:50,833
[COOPER] The part about wanting
your talents was true, as well.

194
00:08:50,916 --> 00:08:54,291
So I thought it would be best to
kill two birds with one stone.

195
00:08:54,375 --> 00:08:56,916
I didn't have a clue,
and Milla never told me.

196
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,083
By Milla, you mean
Valery Vrubel, yes?

197
00:09:00,166 --> 00:09:01,500
[gasps]

198
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:03,791
The only way that I can
absolutely guarantee your safety

199
00:09:03,875 --> 00:09:06,208
is if you agree to come
work for the military.

200
00:09:06,291 --> 00:09:07,666
[KIRILL]
Uh. My safety?

201
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:10,333
[COOPER] The existence
of Nikai is top secret.

202
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:12,208
If your origins were
to be made public,

203
00:09:12,291 --> 00:09:13,833
your lives might be in danger.

204
00:09:13,916 --> 00:09:16,708
That's why this intel
is classified.

205
00:09:16,791 --> 00:09:20,291
And, besides, you are
particularly special.

206
00:09:20,375 --> 00:09:22,166
[KIRILL] What exactly
do you mean by that?

207
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:25,166
[COOPER] I can only tell you the
rest if you join the military.

208
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:26,166
[KIRILL]
But--!

209
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:27,750
[COOPER]
Don't forget what I said.

210
00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:32,166
I'm taking an incalculable risk
by sharing any of this with you.

211
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:33,708
And, make no mistake.

212
00:09:33,791 --> 00:09:36,375
Your very presence at SEVEN-O
puts your friends in danger.

213
00:09:36,458 --> 00:09:37,750
[gasps]

214
00:09:39,208 --> 00:09:42,000
[MILLA] I guess the time
has finally come.

215
00:09:42,083 --> 00:09:44,166
It's true?

216
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:45,708
Why didn't you tell me before?

217
00:09:45,791 --> 00:09:48,791
Because I was desperate
to protect you from it all.

218
00:09:48,875 --> 00:09:52,333
You are the only
family I've got.

219
00:09:52,416 --> 00:09:55,458
Cooper said that I'm
particularly special somehow.

220
00:09:55,541 --> 00:09:58,250
No one ever shared all
the details with me.

221
00:09:58,333 --> 00:09:59,458
Although...

222
00:10:01,166 --> 00:10:03,666
[MILLA] Our mother and those who
helped her risked their lives

223
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:05,833
just to protect the two of us.

224
00:10:05,916 --> 00:10:08,791
I know that.

225
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:11,875
[KIRILL] This Nikai place.
Is it really that dangerous?

226
00:10:11,958 --> 00:10:15,041
[MILLA] I only started dressing
this way to disguise myself.

227
00:10:15,125 --> 00:10:17,833
Dan took us in out of kindness
and continued to care for us,

228
00:10:17,916 --> 00:10:20,250
even after I revealed
the whole truth to him.

229

[KIRILL]

230
00:10:21,583 --> 00:10:22,958
He never said a word, either.

231
00:10:23,041 --> 00:10:24,833
We stand out a lot more
when we're together

232
00:10:24,916 --> 00:10:27,208
than we ever would on our own.

233
00:10:27,291 --> 00:10:28,875
That's why I decided to leave.

234
00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:30,833
[KIRILL]
You left to protect me?

235
00:10:30,916 --> 00:10:33,416
[MILLA] It was my intention
never to see you again.

236
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:36,166
But when fate had other plans,
I got greedy.

237
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:39,791
To be honest, I'm terrified
that they know who we are.

238
00:10:39,875 --> 00:10:41,750
But I'll stand by
you despite that.

239
00:10:41,833 --> 00:10:44,500
I'll support you,
whatever path you choose.

00:11:02,416 --> 00:11:04,208
it would put your friends

00:11:04,291 --> 00:11:05,958
if you kept working
as a detective.

Huh...?

251
00:11:08,416 --> 00:11:10,375
What if, just being around
you was dangerous--

252
00:11:10,458 --> 00:11:12,791
Danger is an
occupational hazard.

00:11:12,875 --> 00:11:14,666
Yeah. I know that.

I'm incredibly fond of this job.

That's all I can say.

How can you even talk like that?

Yuri was our friend,
and she just--

476
00:20:34,791 --> 00:20:36,250
Yuri's dead, okay?

477
00:20:36,333 --> 00:20:39,125
And she's not coming back.

478

It's awful.

I have to tell you a secret.

[APPLE, KAY]
Uh?

481
00:20:45,125 --> 00:20:47,416
None of you were
aware of this, but...

482
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:51,083
Yuri wasn't human,
she was a robot!

483
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:52,833
That means we can repair her.

484
00:20:52,916 --> 00:20:54,166
Isn't that right, Apple?

485
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:55,791
[APPLE]
It's possible, in theory.

486
00:20:55,875 --> 00:20:57,583
But only if we can
find her core.

487
00:20:57,666 --> 00:20:59,083
We do have a spare body.

488
00:20:59,166 --> 00:21:00,000
That's great!

489
00:21:00,083 --> 00:21:01,750
But that explosion was massive.

490
00:21:01,833 --> 00:21:05,125
In a blast like that one, her
core was probably destroyed.

491
00:21:05,208 --> 00:21:07,166
Still, there has got
to be a data backup

[APPLE] Backups of
core data are prohibited.

494
00:21:10,208 --> 00:21:13,250
They were banned because
they raise ethical concerns.

[MAXINE]
As well they should be.

Even if they had the same
data and memories,

497
00:21:21,291 --> 00:21:23,541
could you really think
of her as Yuri?

498
00:21:23,625 --> 00:21:26,666
It would be a different person,
not the Yuri I knew.

499

How can you just accept
it without a fight?!

Don't insult my intelligence, B.

00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:34,000
You planned to back me
into a corner

521

and then bribed the helicopter
pilot to take my life.

I can't imagine why
you would think that.

It's reasonable to assume
you're trying to usurp me.

Did you give those kids
the Anthem to undermine

my authority? To sow seeds of
chaos in the organization?

My intention is crystal clear:
