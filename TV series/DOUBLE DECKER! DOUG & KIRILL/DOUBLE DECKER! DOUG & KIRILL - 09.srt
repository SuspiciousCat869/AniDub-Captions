Those are all super badass!
Go, Apple!

you call me, "Doctor."

this weird new function

you put into the eye system?

It's called the view jack.

Sure, that.

You've got it all wrong here!

despite being a police
organization first,

SEVEN-O is also under

00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:12,666
[COOPER]
The criminals gave us a clue

00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:14,666
when they sent us
their ransom demand.

[DOUG]
"Ransom demand"?

00:04:23,333 --> 00:04:25,041
So, that means this
is just a cash grab.

75
00:04:25,125 --> 00:04:27,250
[COOPER] Your assessment
is likely correct.

76
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:29,500
But, in light of the upcoming
mayoral elections,

77
00:04:29,583 --> 00:04:32,625
we need to be open to the idea
that Dorman's political rivals

78
00:04:32,708 --> 00:04:34,041
could also be involved.

79
00:04:34,125 --> 00:04:35,875
And, considering the fact that
we're going up against

80
00:04:35,958 --> 00:04:39,000
Esperanza, we can't
afford to take chances.

We've got to be ready
for anything.

[DOUG]
Understood, sir.

83
00:04:48,166 --> 00:04:49,666
So, we should treat this
as a direct case, then?

00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:51,250
[KIRILL]
Hey, what's a direct case?

It's the term for a case

86
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:53,916
that comes directly
from the military.

87

[COOPER] Yes, but there's
a bit more to this one.

[TRAVIS] There's a great deal
more risk involved than usual.

You'll be nearby, surveying.

Mr. Dorman will be

won't have his own receiver.

00:07:53,708 --> 00:07:56,500
[ZABEL] I'm afraid the matter
is none of your business.

161
00:07:56,583 --> 00:07:59,541
Sorry. You will keep
your promise, though.

162
00:07:59,625 --> 00:08:04,083
You're going to do everything we
tell you to, with no exceptions.

163
00:08:04,166 --> 00:08:06,000
We're in this together now.

164
00:08:06,083 --> 00:08:08,958
Even if you wanted out,
there's no turning back.

165
00:08:09,041 --> 00:08:10,750
But, is my daughter safe?

166
00:08:10,833 --> 00:08:13,291
[ZABEL] I'll release her without
a scratch, as promised.

167
00:08:13,375 --> 00:08:15,250
The boss decided in
the pen that he wouldn't

168
00:08:15,333 --> 00:08:17,791
be killin' kids no more.
Good news for you.

169
00:08:17,875 --> 00:08:20,458
[THUG 09A] Yeah, but the bad
news is he shows no mercy

170
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:23,041
to people who waste
perfectly good food.

171
00:08:23,125 --> 00:08:25,291
Daddy fought bravely
to rescue his poor,

172
00:08:25,375 --> 00:08:27,375
innocent daughter
from the bad guys.

173
00:08:27,458 --> 00:08:30,333
That's the story you want
the papers to run, right?

174
00:08:35,208 --> 00:08:37,875
[APPLE sighs]
Just like I thought, no luck.

175
00:08:37,958 --> 00:08:40,416
These cameras are positioned
to monitor the river.

176
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:41,791
Can't expect much.

177
00:08:41,875 --> 00:08:43,666
Can we check any
of the other feeds?

178
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:45,500
They're in a stolen vehicle.

179
00:08:45,583 --> 00:08:48,708
The license plates aren't
gonna tell us a damn thing.

180
00:08:48,791 --> 00:08:51,083
Poor Doug.
If he doesn't make it...

181
00:08:51,166 --> 00:08:53,125
Don't even think that!

182
00:08:55,625 --> 00:08:57,416
Buzz-Cut. You can't just leave.

183
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,083
That's right, we're on standby.

184
00:08:59,166 --> 00:09:00,375
Kirill!

185
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:04,000
Dammit, Doug!

186
00:09:04,083 --> 00:09:07,375
I'm the one who's supposed
to get caught! Ya jerk!

187
00:09:07,458 --> 00:09:10,250
[DEANA] How could those lowlifes
have known about our plan?

188
00:09:10,333 --> 00:09:11,875
What the hell is going on here?

189
00:09:11,958 --> 00:09:14,000
Do you think they were
listening in on our messages?

190
00:09:14,083 --> 00:09:15,583
There's no possible way.

191
00:09:15,666 --> 00:09:18,083
I used my own personal brand
of encryption on them.

192
00:09:18,166 --> 00:09:19,666
It's pretty much infallible.

193
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:21,708
Maybe your ego
is to blame, then.

194
00:09:21,791 --> 00:09:23,791
What if you're wrong, and
they broke the encryption?

195
00:09:23,875 --> 00:09:26,916
The radio output is so low
the signal's barely detectible!

196
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,083
The technology that
amplifies the receiver--

197
00:09:29,166 --> 00:09:31,791
I'm the only person
who knows how to-- Uh!

198
00:09:31,875 --> 00:09:33,125
[door opens]

199
00:09:33,208 --> 00:09:34,958
[MAXINE]
Deana. Kay. Listen.

200
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:36,250
[beeping]

201
00:09:36,333 --> 00:09:37,875
[DEANA] Buzz-Cut, you read?
Better come back.

202
00:09:37,958 --> 00:09:39,166
We found Dorman's daughter.

203
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:40,500
[gasps]

204
00:09:41,875 --> 00:09:42,916
[MAXINE]
When we located the victim,

205
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,791
she was able to give
the exact location

206
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:45,958
of the kidnappers' hideout.

207
00:09:46,041 --> 00:09:47,416
Dorman was found soon after,

208
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:50,083
unconscious in a seedy
hotel room in the area.

209
00:09:50,166 --> 00:09:51,625
Did they find Doug yet?

210
00:09:51,708 --> 00:09:53,500
The room was otherwise empty.

211
00:09:53,583 --> 00:09:55,000
Nobody in there but Dorman.

212
00:09:55,083 --> 00:09:57,125
So, they're keeping
Doug somewhere else.

213
00:09:57,208 --> 00:10:00,000
All right. Are we positive
we can trust this info?

214
00:10:00,083 --> 00:10:02,166
[MAXINE]
Yes. No doubt in my mind, sir.

215
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:04,708
The daughter gave us some
additional intel, as well.

216
00:10:04,791 --> 00:10:09,125
Something that her dad picked
up from one of the kidnappers.

217
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:12,166
[DORMAN]
You must've been so scared.

218
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:14,291
I'm sorry... Sarah.

219
00:10:14,375 --> 00:10:17,000
But you're strong,
you'll be fine.

220
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:18,833
Pass along a message from me.

221
00:10:18,916 --> 00:10:22,166
Can you do that?

222
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:25,791
"Sergeant Doug Billingham
isn't dead, yet."

223
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:34,291
I wanted to say thank you
for all your help

224
00:10:34,375 --> 00:10:37,250
when we last met, Doug.
I would be dead

225
00:10:37,333 --> 00:10:40,541
if it weren't for you,
and I will never forget that.

226
00:10:48,083 --> 00:10:49,625
But why would they take Doug?

227
00:10:49,708 --> 00:10:51,791
If the kidnapping
was truly a ploy

228
00:10:51,875 --> 00:10:53,333
then maybe
the kidnappers' real aim

229
00:10:53,416 --> 00:10:55,041
was to take an
investigator hostage.

230
00:10:55,125 --> 00:10:55,875
[ALL gasp]

231
00:10:55,958 --> 00:10:56,791
For revenge?

232
00:10:56,875 --> 00:10:57,958
No, sir.

233
00:10:58,041 --> 00:10:59,625
As evil as they are,
they're not stupid.

234
00:10:59,708 --> 00:11:02,125
[gasps] For information?

235
00:11:02,208 --> 00:11:06,083
[COOPER] Yes. That's more
the more likely scenario.

236
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:07,333
I get it.

237
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:10,375
So that's what you've
been after all along?

[splash]

239

[muffled groans]

240
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:14,375
[COOPER] We can safely
assume that Esperanza

241
00:11:14,458 --> 00:11:15,875
kidnapped one of your comrades--

242
00:11:15,958 --> 00:11:19,125
to torture him for
classified information.

243
00:11:19,208 --> 00:11:21,875
And my best guess?
They want any intelligence

244
00:11:21,958 --> 00:11:25,000
he can provide regarding
your Anti-AMS bullets.

245
00:11:25,083 --> 00:11:26,708
We already know quite a lot.

246
00:11:26,791 --> 00:11:29,583
The five Overdrive antidote
drugs, for example.

247
00:11:29,666 --> 00:11:31,916
However, we need your help
with some of the particulars,

248
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,750
proper dosages and such.

249
00:11:33,833 --> 00:11:35,875
All of the drugs
are extremely potent.

250
00:11:35,958 --> 00:11:38,750
Some are even fatal in
the wrong quantities.

251
00:11:38,833 --> 00:11:40,958
So, you see the tangle
that we're in?

252
00:11:41,041 --> 00:11:43,375
We need you to tell us
the appropriate formulas,

253
00:11:43,458 --> 00:11:46,083
and the order of operations,
if you don't mind.

254
00:11:46,166 --> 00:11:48,125
And I was hoping you might
be willing to tell me how

255
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:50,583
this lovely little
device functions?

256
00:11:50,666 --> 00:11:53,000
It's such a mystery to me.

257
00:11:53,083 --> 00:11:55,666
That sounds just like something
Esperanza would do.

258
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:58,125
I know how to find Doug!
I've got a great idea!

259
00:11:58,208 --> 00:11:59,208
[gasps]

260
00:11:59,291 --> 00:12:00,625
Using the view jack?

261
00:12:00,708 --> 00:12:01,833
Yes.

262
00:12:01,916 --> 00:12:03,458
I made a modification
to the radio program

263
00:12:03,541 --> 00:12:05,208
that expanded
the receiver range.

264
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:07,625
Way to outdo yourself, Apple!

265
00:12:08,625 --> 00:12:10,416
Okay. There!

Zabel. But how?

267

[DOUG]
I get it now... Zabel.

268
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:22,000
[ZABEL] Hm? Have you decided
to cooperate, then?

269
00:12:22,083 --> 00:12:23,375
[DOUG]
It's reversed.

270
00:12:23,458 --> 00:12:25,166
The code works backwards.

271
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:27,166
Reverse alphabetical order.

272

You've always been the boss.

And what if I have?

274
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,958
[DOUG] Then all I have
to do is take you out

275
00:12:33,041 --> 00:12:35,208
and Esperanza's finished.

Can't ID the building.

There aren't enough visual
markers to tell much.

279
00:12:42,291 --> 00:12:44,291
Well, if Doug knew,
maybe he could give us

280
00:12:44,375 --> 00:12:45,583
some clues as to
his whereabouts.

281
00:12:45,666 --> 00:12:48,833
Don't worry, he knows
we're watching along.

to deter peeping toms.

If you don't talk, you'll die.

00:12:57,875 --> 00:12:59,125
But you knew that.

as you might think.

It's a map of

I'll go run a search for all
garages with that layout.

Come on.

We need to act fast.

293
00:13:16,125 --> 00:13:18,583
Yeah. Doug will never let
these guys break him.

294
00:13:18,666 --> 00:13:20,791
Somehow I could sense that.

295
00:13:20,875 --> 00:13:23,250
He would rather die
than give in!

296
00:13:25,875 --> 00:13:28,375
[ZABEL] Hm... Looks like
he won't be talking,

297
00:13:28,458 --> 00:13:31,125
no matter what atrocities
we subject him to.

298
00:13:31,208 --> 00:13:32,458
Unless something were to happen

299
00:13:32,541 --> 00:13:35,083
that altered his mind
as well as his body.

300
00:13:35,166 --> 00:13:38,541
Perhaps then he'll sing
just like a nightingale.

They're gonna dose
him with Anthem!

Unfortunately, that does seem
to be the plan of attack.

I wish we could tell Doug
what we're up to.

Beyond just letting him know
we're able to watch this.

figured something out!

Hopefully, he'll catch on

I found out where
they're holding him.

It's the parking structure
on Simpson Drive.

I'll call in a military
special forces unit for back-up.

We'll send in a chopper to
retrieve him from above.

A helicopter's way too risky!

Well, can you think of a faster
way to get to him, then?

to do whatever you can to
distract the enemy from within.

Then you'll head straight to the

00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:09,041
[COOPER] I'm impressed with
how brave you all are.

475
00:21:09,125 --> 00:21:11,291
Nah. I'm nothing special.

476
00:21:11,375 --> 00:21:13,000
Heh. Bye!

477
00:21:15,333 --> 00:21:16,458
By the way.

478
00:21:16,541 --> 00:21:18,583
That little good luck
charm of yours.

479
00:21:18,666 --> 00:21:20,416
Where did you say
you heard it, again?

480
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:21,833
Huh?

481
00:21:21,916 --> 00:21:25,166
[COOPER] "Don't think.
Feel so good." Wasn't that it?

482
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:26,875
Oh. That. Right.

483
00:21:26,958 --> 00:21:28,625
It's just a little motto
my grandfather

484
00:21:28,708 --> 00:21:30,416
taught me before
he passed away.

485
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:33,250
Though, to be honest, I'm not
sure those are the exact words.

486
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:34,583
I forget.

487
00:21:34,666 --> 00:21:37,083
I see. Well,
it's still good advice.

488
00:21:37,166 --> 00:21:39,708
My grandpa would've
loved to hear you say that.

489
00:21:39,791 --> 00:21:40,583
See ya, sir!

490
00:21:40,666 --> 00:21:42,500
[door creaks]

491
00:21:44,541 --> 00:21:46,833
[DOUG]
Thank you, Constable Vrubel.

492
00:21:46,916 --> 00:21:48,416
You don't need to
thank me, buddy.

493
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:49,333
I just did what any par--

494
00:21:49,416 --> 00:21:51,208
You're officially my hero now.

495
00:21:51,291 --> 00:21:53,166
[KIRILL gasping]

496
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:54,541
If the roles had been reversed,

497
00:21:54,625 --> 00:21:56,708
I'm not so sure I would have
done the same for you.

498
00:21:56,791 --> 00:21:58,625
So, I feel especially grateful.

499
00:21:58,708 --> 00:22:01,125
[KIRILL]
Huh?

500
00:22:01,208 --> 00:22:03,833
That's right! Doug!

501
00:22:03,916 --> 00:22:06,125
Why didn't you come save me
when I was in danger?!

502
00:22:06,208 --> 00:22:07,666
[DOUG]
Hm? Well, I--

503
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:10,083
I just said that's why
I'm so grateful to you.

504
00:22:10,166 --> 00:22:12,708
[KIRILL] That doesn't
make it better, though!

505
00:23:46,958 --> 00:23:49,416
[COOPER]
"Prometheus's fire

506
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:53,958
is there when you
don't think, feel so.

507
00:23:54,041 --> 00:23:59,375
Good gifts and blessings
shall be given to you then."

508
00:24:00,833 --> 00:24:02,250
How'd he know it?

509
00:24:02,333 --> 00:24:05,416
Precious few have
heard Nikai's prayer.

510
00:24:11,625 --> 00:24:13,416
[NARRATOR] The team succeeded
in rescuing Doug.

511
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:15,750
But next time, something
unexpected happens!

512
00:24:15,833 --> 00:24:17,416
Or maybe it doesn't!
That's right!

513
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:19,833
With love, boxes of chocolates,
and <i>Double Decker,</i>

514
00:24:19,916 --> 00:24:21,416
you never know
what you're gonna get!

515
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:22,791
Next time, episode ten:

516
00:24:22,875 --> 00:24:25,166
"Failed Detective, but Pure!"
Who cares if I fail?

517
00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:26,250
I'm untarnished!
