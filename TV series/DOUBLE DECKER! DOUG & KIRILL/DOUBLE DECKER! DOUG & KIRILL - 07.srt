00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:06,625
Come on!

162
00:08:06,708 --> 00:08:09,250
He already confessed to the
charges, Doug, let him go!

163
00:08:09,333 --> 00:08:10,666
Doug!

164
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:13,750
[KIRILL] It wasn't like
him to become obsessed

165
00:08:13,833 --> 00:08:15,458
with a case like this.

166
00:08:15,541 --> 00:08:19,833
He broke his own rule and
got emotionally invested.

167
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:22,333
[KIRILL] Listen. You've been
acting weird lately.

168
00:08:22,416 --> 00:08:23,583
What's going on?

169
00:08:23,666 --> 00:08:26,000
Who is this Good-looking
Joe guy to you, anyway?

170
00:08:26,083 --> 00:08:28,958
Workday's done. I'm outta here.

171
00:08:34,541 --> 00:08:37,250
[JOE] So, you're sayin' the cops
are sniffing around after me?

172
00:08:37,333 --> 00:08:39,333
[CHIEF HENCHMAN 7A]
Yeah. Some guy with SEVEN-O.

173
00:08:39,416 --> 00:08:41,625
Name's Doug Billingham,
apparently.

174
00:08:41,708 --> 00:08:43,916
[JOE]
Huh. Doesn't ring a bell.

175
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,375
Is that all you've got on him?

176
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:46,916
[CHIEF HENCHMAN 7A] I heard
he used to be a detective

177
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,375
with Precinct Three.

178
00:08:48,458 --> 00:08:50,250
[JOE]
Ah, now, that's more like it.

179
00:08:50,333 --> 00:08:53,541
Dennis's old unit, I believe.

180
00:08:53,625 --> 00:08:56,416
That brings me right back.

181
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,166
[DOUG]
If you happen to hear anything,

182
00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:00,375
contact me immediately.

183
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,541
[KIRILL]
Even on his days off,

184
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:04,041
Doug would spend
all his time searching

185
00:09:04,125 --> 00:09:05,958
for clues about this Joe.

186
00:09:06,041 --> 00:09:07,041
So far,

187
00:09:07,125 --> 00:09:08,416
I'd gathered that
Joe was a gangster

188
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,750
who had made a name
for himself in the area.

189
00:09:10,833 --> 00:09:13,625
Back before Esperanza
had become what it is now.

190
00:09:13,708 --> 00:09:15,208
I could only imagine why Doug

191
00:09:15,291 --> 00:09:18,000
had developed such tunnel
vision about it all.

192
00:09:19,375 --> 00:09:20,458
What's with you?

193
00:09:20,541 --> 00:09:23,416
You've been so secretive.
It bothers me.

194
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,041
Look, don't worry.

195
00:09:25,125 --> 00:09:27,833
I won't cause you
any trouble, got it?

196
00:09:29,666 --> 00:09:31,583
[KIRILL] But you've become
obsessed, Doug!

197
00:09:31,666 --> 00:09:35,166
Is it because
Pat Morino's involved?

198
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:37,291
[DOUG]
Where'd you hear that name?

199
00:09:39,333 --> 00:09:41,000
[KIRILL] You sure you've
got the right info?

200
00:09:41,083 --> 00:09:43,125
Yeah. Nobody had heard anything

201
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:45,916
about his coworkers or
other partners dying.

202
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,500
The only thing I did hear,

203
00:09:47,583 --> 00:09:50,583
is that he was particularly fond
of a certain information broker,

204
00:09:50,666 --> 00:09:52,625
and that was the only
person close to him

205
00:09:52,708 --> 00:09:54,208
who ended up getting offed.

206
00:09:54,291 --> 00:09:56,166
Who is this Pat Morino?

207
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:59,083
Someone close to you?

208
00:09:59,166 --> 00:10:00,583
[DOUG]
Yeah.

209
00:10:00,666 --> 00:10:02,083
[KIRILL]
I thought so.

210
00:10:02,166 --> 00:10:05,416
You're not trying to get
revenge for that, are you?

211
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:07,666
Do you think I'm
that old-fashioned?

212
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:09,083
Don't worry.

213
00:10:11,291 --> 00:10:15,416
[TRAVIS] Pat Morino, huh?
So... What did he say?

214
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,500
[KIRILL]
Uh. Come on. You know Doug.

215
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:18,916
He didn't really say anything.

216
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,083
Okay. Then I suppose I
shouldn't say a word, either.

217
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:28,208
[JOE] No doubt you've heard
all the rumors, right?

218
00:10:28,291 --> 00:10:29,833
About this SEVEN-O
detective who's been

219
00:10:29,916 --> 00:10:32,208
asking about me all over town?

220
00:10:32,291 --> 00:10:33,583
I don't know anything about him,

221
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:35,500
so I've been choosing
to ignore it.

222
00:10:35,583 --> 00:10:37,916
But then I found out someone's
been meeting with him,

223
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,291
giving him information on me.

224
00:10:40,375 --> 00:10:41,208
[PAUL]
P-Please!

225
00:10:41,291 --> 00:10:42,458
I didn't mean to tell him!

226
00:10:42,541 --> 00:10:44,458
[JOE]
Oh, I know that, Paul.

227
00:10:44,541 --> 00:10:45,875
We're friends.

228
00:10:45,958 --> 00:10:47,500
Why would you betray me?

229
00:10:47,583 --> 00:10:50,875
Uh. Hey, uh. Lemme
ask you something.

230
00:10:50,958 --> 00:10:53,333
Ever heard of a Pat Morino?

231
00:10:53,416 --> 00:10:54,833
[JOE]
I haven't, who's that?

232
00:10:54,916 --> 00:10:56,541
Man, I wish I knew.

233
00:10:56,625 --> 00:10:59,208
But, still. If Doug is
out lookin' for you--

234
00:10:59,291 --> 00:11:00,333
that's the reason.

235
00:11:00,416 --> 00:11:01,541
[JOE]
Huh.

236
00:11:01,625 --> 00:11:03,708
[PAUL] Look, if you
promise not to hurt me,

237
00:11:03,791 --> 00:11:06,083
I'll tell you everything I know.

238
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:09,750
Even though I got out of this
ugly scene a long time ago, man.

239
00:11:09,833 --> 00:11:11,000
[JOE]
Yes, I heard that.

240
00:11:11,083 --> 00:11:12,750
Got a kid now and everything.

241
00:11:12,833 --> 00:11:14,916
So, you'd sell out the
detective who saved your life

242
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,416
to protect your little family?

243
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:17,500
[CHIEF HENCHMAN 7A]
Stay still!

244
00:11:17,583 --> 00:11:20,250
Uh. No! Wait! Please don't!

245
00:11:20,333 --> 00:11:21,958
I'll talk!

246
00:11:22,041 --> 00:11:24,875
[JOE]
You're a very bad man, Paul.

247
00:11:56,166 --> 00:11:58,916
[DENNIS] Listen, why not
back off for a while?

248
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,416
Let 'em cool off--
they're out for blood.

249
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,875
I just can't.

250
00:12:03,958 --> 00:12:05,583
I understand how you feel,

251
00:12:05,666 --> 00:12:10,083
but nothing you do is going to
bring Pat back from the grave.

252
00:12:10,166 --> 00:12:11,333
And to be fair,

253
00:12:11,416 --> 00:12:12,750
there's no proof
Good-looking Joe

254
00:12:12,833 --> 00:12:14,875
had anything to do
with Pat's death.

255
00:12:14,958 --> 00:12:17,500
Which is why I'm investigating.

256
00:12:17,583 --> 00:12:20,250
Your co-workers are
going to get hurt, Doug.

257
00:12:20,333 --> 00:12:22,583
We're all detectives.

258
00:12:22,666 --> 00:12:25,333
That's an occupational hazard.

259
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:37,916
[JOE] One of the dealers on my
turf has been apprehended.

260
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,500
He caught a charge.

261
00:12:39,583 --> 00:12:40,875
[CHIEF HENCHMAN 7A]
No, another one?

262
00:12:40,958 --> 00:12:42,208
Yeah.

263
00:12:42,291 --> 00:12:44,583
It's that Doug Billingham guy.

264
00:12:44,666 --> 00:12:47,125
[ringing]

265
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:49,541
[JOE] Hey there, Doug
Billingham, right?

266
00:12:49,625 --> 00:12:51,916
You on duty today?

267
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,416
[DOUG]
Joe?

268
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:54,708
[JOE]
I'm quite pleased to see

269
00:12:54,791 --> 00:12:56,875
you're keeping yourself
busy out there.

270
00:12:56,958 --> 00:12:58,583
[DOUG]
You're right, very busy.

271
00:12:58,666 --> 00:13:00,916
So, I gotta go, sorry. Bye, now.

272
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,166
[JOE]
Wait, Doug.

273
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:04,583
I think there may be a
slight misunderstanding

274
00:13:04,666 --> 00:13:06,166
between the two of us.

275
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:08,625
I'm rather busy, too, and would
hate to create more work

276
00:13:08,708 --> 00:13:10,666
for myself than necessary.

277
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:13,958
Why don't you and I meet
for a little chat?

278
00:13:14,041 --> 00:13:17,083
[DOUG] I don't think we have
anything to discuss.

279
00:13:17,166 --> 00:13:19,083
Doug says he'll be right over.

280
00:13:19,166 --> 00:13:20,333
[DOUG]
Huh?

281
00:13:20,416 --> 00:13:22,250
[DENNIS] Don't, Doug!
It's a trap, stay away!

282
00:13:22,333 --> 00:13:23,416
[DOUG gasps]

283
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,333
[JOE] I think you
recognize that voice.

284
00:13:25,416 --> 00:13:26,375
Fine.

285
00:13:26,458 --> 00:13:28,000
How many men have you got?

286
00:13:28,083 --> 00:13:29,166
[JOE]
Huh?

287
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:31,250
[DOUG] Better bring
as many as you can.

288
00:13:31,333 --> 00:13:33,083
That way I can
claim self-defense

289
00:13:33,166 --> 00:13:35,000
without any questions.

290
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:37,416
[KIRILL] You want me to
take over your shift?

291
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:38,375
That's rare.

292
00:13:38,458 --> 00:13:39,375
Yeah, well.

293
00:13:39,458 --> 00:13:41,458
There's somewhere I gotta be.

294
00:13:41,541 --> 00:13:43,000
Sounds like somebody's
got himself

295
00:13:43,083 --> 00:13:45,333
a hot lead on Good-Looking Joe.

296
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:48,083
[KIRILL gasps]

297
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:56,750
Just forget your
revenge, Doug. Please.

298
00:13:56,833 --> 00:14:00,416
I can't turn down
this invitation.

299
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:03,583
[KIRILL] Well, what are you
doing bringing this with you?

300
00:14:03,666 --> 00:14:05,125
Mind your business.

301
00:14:05,208 --> 00:14:08,500
I've got permission to carry
that when I'm off-duty.

302
00:14:08,583 --> 00:14:11,125
That's not even what
I'm talking about.

303
00:14:12,625 --> 00:14:14,500
[KIRILL]
Crap! What the--?

304
00:14:14,583 --> 00:14:17,333
[DOUG] Some kind of tranquilizer
Doctor Apple developed.

305
00:14:17,416 --> 00:14:18,916
Nighty-night.

306
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,041
[crash]

307
00:14:23,291 --> 00:14:25,833
It's almost over, old friend.

308
00:14:25,916 --> 00:14:28,083
Gotta borrow this for a bit.

309
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,833
[KIRILL]
Doug...

310
00:14:32,916 --> 00:14:35,708
[DOUG] Take me to Joe,
don't ask questions.

311
00:14:37,041 --> 00:14:38,291
[gasps]

312
00:14:38,375 --> 00:14:40,708
[TRAVIS] Wait, wait, wait.
He's out for revenge?

313
00:14:40,791 --> 00:14:42,291
[KIRILL]
Yeah, I'm positive now!

314
00:14:42,375 --> 00:14:43,750
Why didn't you try to stop him?

315
00:14:43,833 --> 00:14:46,208
Well, I, uh. I didn't realize

316
00:14:46,291 --> 00:14:48,000
things had already
progressed to that point.

317
00:14:48,083 --> 00:14:50,708
There's a chance he's
gonna murder someone!

318
00:14:50,791 --> 00:14:52,125
So, what, then?

319
00:14:52,208 --> 00:14:54,416
Should I have told Doug to
drop the case altogether?

320
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:55,875
I don't know.

321
00:14:55,958 --> 00:14:58,250
[TRAVIS] Do you have proof
it's all about revenge?

322
00:14:58,333 --> 00:15:00,291
Who would even make that call?

323
00:15:00,375 --> 00:15:03,750
Is it me? Or you, perhaps?

324
00:15:04,791 --> 00:15:08,416
[TRAVIS] I trust the morality
of all my detectives.

325
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:10,416
Didn't you hear
what I just said?

326
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:12,000
[KIRILL]
Oh, shut up!

327
00:15:12,083 --> 00:15:14,666
I can't believe I almost let you
talk me out of following him!

328
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:21,083
[JOE]
Welcome, good sir.

329
00:15:27,041 --> 00:15:29,208
What'd you do with Dennis?

330
00:15:32,833 --> 00:15:36,666
[JOE] Now, drop the weapon and
put your hands behind your head.

331
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:38,791
[clattering]

332
00:15:38,875 --> 00:15:40,500
[DENNIS grunts]

333
00:15:42,291 --> 00:15:43,416
What's the matter?

334
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,583
You can go.

335
00:15:45,666 --> 00:15:47,833
[JOE]
Oh, I almost forgot.

336
00:15:47,916 --> 00:15:49,458
Dennis is a regular.

337
00:15:49,541 --> 00:15:51,750
Shows up like clockwork.

338
00:15:51,833 --> 00:15:53,375
How do you think
I was able to find out

339
00:15:53,458 --> 00:15:54,583
everything there was to know

340
00:15:54,666 --> 00:15:57,125
about you and your friend,
No-scale Paul?

341
00:15:57,208 --> 00:15:59,458
Heh. It's so ironic.

342
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:03,583
Your old boss is a
textbook drug addict.

343
00:16:03,666 --> 00:16:05,500
[DENNIS]
Please forgive me, Doug.

344
00:16:05,583 --> 00:16:09,583
Sure. I should've picked
up on the signs sooner.

345
00:16:11,625 --> 00:16:14,916
[JOE] Now, let's talk about you,
Doug Billingham.

346
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,458
First of all,

347
00:16:16,541 --> 00:16:18,250
I've been hearing you've got it
out for me because I killed

348
00:16:18,333 --> 00:16:21,125
an information broker by
the name of Pat Morino.

349
00:16:21,208 --> 00:16:22,458
I feel bad.

350
00:16:22,541 --> 00:16:25,500
Because I don't have the
faintest clue who that is.

351
00:16:25,583 --> 00:16:28,000
Would you be a pal and tell me?

352
00:16:28,083 --> 00:16:29,250
[KIRILL]
A shoe shiner?

353
00:16:29,333 --> 00:16:30,125
It's true.

354
00:16:30,208 --> 00:16:31,666
Pat shined shoes as a cover,

355
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:34,791
but made actual money
selling information.

356
00:16:34,875 --> 00:16:38,083
Eight years ago, when Doug
was a brand-new detective,

357
00:16:38,166 --> 00:16:40,875
Esperanza was much more
violent than they are now,

358
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:42,333
if you can believe that.

359
00:16:42,416 --> 00:16:43,916
Their members were maniacs.

360
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,791
Always after each other's
throats like a bunch of animals.

361
00:16:47,875 --> 00:16:51,208
One day, Pat was shining
shoes, as usual.

362
00:16:51,291 --> 00:16:54,458
And met an untimely
and very tragic end.

363
00:16:54,541 --> 00:16:56,083
Got riddled with bullets.

364
00:16:56,166 --> 00:16:57,750
Thirteen of them in all.

365
00:16:57,833 --> 00:17:00,666
And this Good-looking
Joe was responsible?

366
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:03,375
[TRAVIS] There was never
any proof found of that.

367
00:17:03,458 --> 00:17:07,333
Joe disappeared shortly after,
dropped right off the map.

368
00:17:07,416 --> 00:17:10,166
That's part of Doug's
obsession with Esperanza.

369
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:12,875
He wants to find his
proof and act on it.

370
00:17:12,958 --> 00:17:16,791
[JOE] Oh, I remember it now!
The whole story!

371
00:17:16,875 --> 00:17:18,916
All I want to know is this:

372
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,041
Why'd you kill Pat?

373
00:17:20,125 --> 00:17:21,333
[JOE]
Huh?

374
00:17:21,416 --> 00:17:24,375
[DOUG] There was no
justifiable reason for it.

375
00:17:24,458 --> 00:17:27,125
[JOE]
The shoe polish job.

376
00:17:27,208 --> 00:17:32,333
I hate when people use the wrong
color when they polish my shoes!

377
00:17:32,416 --> 00:17:34,083
I hope you rot in hell.

378
00:17:34,166 --> 00:17:34,916
Huh?

379
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,875
You'd kill for that?

380
00:17:36,958 --> 00:17:42,333
You bastard. You murdered
an innocent kid over shoes?

381
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,958
[TRAVIS]
Pat Morino. Short for Patricia.

382
00:17:48,041 --> 00:17:50,875
At the time, she was
a 12-year-old girl.

383
00:17:50,958 --> 00:17:51,958
[JOE]
She would be, what?

384
00:17:52,041 --> 00:17:53,833
Twenty now? Come on.

385
00:17:53,916 --> 00:17:57,041
Her life was going
nowhere anyway.

386
00:17:57,125 --> 00:17:59,208
It was a mercy, don't you agree?

387
00:17:59,291 --> 00:18:01,375
Doug Billingham.

388
00:18:01,458 --> 00:18:04,666
I'm relieved to finally meet
you face-to-face, Joe.

389
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:07,750
You're even more
despicable than I thought.

390
00:18:07,833 --> 00:18:10,791
[JOE] Well, I think that's
enough talk for one evening.

391
00:18:10,875 --> 00:18:11,875
[snaps]

392
00:18:11,958 --> 00:18:14,208
[KIRILL]
How awful. You mean, this guy

393
00:18:14,291 --> 00:18:17,125
just murdered a 12-year-old
orphan in cold blood?

394
00:18:17,208 --> 00:18:18,500
That's the sad truth.

395
00:18:18,583 --> 00:18:20,291
It's what started it all.

396
00:18:20,375 --> 00:18:23,208
Doug's hatred of poverty
and the class system.

397
00:18:23,291 --> 00:18:25,750
At least, that's what I think.

398
00:18:25,833 --> 00:18:28,291
[DOUG] Strength in numbers
doesn't apply here.

399
00:18:28,375 --> 00:18:30,708
You're going to have to
outsmart me to survive.

400
00:18:30,791 --> 00:18:32,875
[JOE]
Remember, you requested them.

401
00:18:32,958 --> 00:18:36,500
It's a little trick I've learned
over the past eight years.

402
00:18:38,541 --> 00:18:40,791
Oh, is this the little
"trick" you mentioned?

403
00:18:40,875 --> 00:18:42,750
I must say, I'm disappointed.

404
00:18:42,833 --> 00:18:44,416
A Lady Joker, eh?

405
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:46,625
Ooh, and with
hollow points, too.

406
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:48,125
[JOE chuckles]

407
00:18:48,208 --> 00:18:50,750
I do love the juxtaposition
of a cute little gun loaded

408
00:18:50,833 --> 00:18:53,291
with such a brutal
kind of bullet.

409
00:18:53,375 --> 00:18:55,250
[TRAVIS]
You know. Doug never bought

410
00:18:55,333 --> 00:18:57,916
a shred of information
from Pat over the years.

411
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,416
He wanted her to get out.

412
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:02,500
To drop the business because
of the danger it put her in.

413
00:19:02,583 --> 00:19:04,333
He really cared about that kid.

414
00:19:04,416 --> 00:19:06,666
But she refused to
heed his advice.

415
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:09,041
So Doug settled for
the next best thing.

416
00:19:09,125 --> 00:19:11,583
He gave her a gun, so she
could protect herself.

417
00:19:11,666 --> 00:19:13,166
[KIRILL]
Doug bought a child a gun?

418
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:15,833
[TRAVIS] Yeah. He slipped
her a Lady Joker one day,

419
00:19:15,916 --> 00:19:18,750
in case she ran into trouble.

420
00:19:18,833 --> 00:19:21,041
You don't know how
predictable you are.

421
00:19:21,125 --> 00:19:23,500
I knew a coward would
make this choice.

422
00:19:23,583 --> 00:19:24,708
Goodbye, Doug.

423
00:19:24,791 --> 00:19:26,375
Nope, I win.

424
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:29,166
Uh?

425
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:31,083
[DOUG]
I loaded it with dummies.

426
00:19:31,166 --> 00:19:34,375
Except the fourth one,
which was a flash bullet.

427
00:19:39,416 --> 00:19:42,083
[KIRILL] So, she refused
to take the gun? How odd.

428
00:19:42,166 --> 00:19:44,625
Indeed. That's what I heard.

429
00:19:44,708 --> 00:19:45,958
[KIRILL]
But why?

430
00:19:46,041 --> 00:19:49,541
[TRAVIS] Who knows?
That part is anyone's guess.

431
00:19:50,416 --> 00:19:51,708
No, Doug.

432
00:19:51,791 --> 00:19:55,333
A policeman isn't supposed
to break the rules.

433
00:19:55,416 --> 00:19:56,375
[DOUG grunts]

434
00:19:57,083 --> 00:20:00,208
[TRAVIS]
Her death changed Doug forever.

435
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,041
[TRAVIS] Doug's penchant
for following rules

436
00:20:03,125 --> 00:20:06,000
and regulations on
every job stems from it.

437
00:20:06,083 --> 00:20:07,416
I guess he thought
he could minimize

438
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:08,875
any future pain that way.

439
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:10,375
But I'm no therapist.

440
00:20:10,458 --> 00:20:12,791
[JOE whimpers]

441
00:20:13,625 --> 00:20:15,958
[DOUG] Anyone who banks on
their cronies protecting them

442
00:20:16,041 --> 00:20:18,041
will inevitably let
their guard down.

443
00:20:18,125 --> 00:20:20,166
Cowards like you
are all the same.

444
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:21,958
You think using all
the best weapons

445
00:20:22,041 --> 00:20:23,791
will make up for your weakness.

446
00:20:23,875 --> 00:20:25,000
Wait! Let's talk!

447
00:20:25,083 --> 00:20:26,666
I'm sure we can
work something out!

448
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:28,708
You're a detective, right?

449
00:20:28,791 --> 00:20:30,708
That's true. I am.

450
00:20:30,791 --> 00:20:34,041
Now, I have some good news
and bad news for you, Joe.

451
00:20:34,125 --> 00:20:36,583
Which do you want first?

452
00:20:36,666 --> 00:20:38,625
The good news is I can
blow your head off

453
00:20:38,708 --> 00:20:41,375
and claim self-defense without
any pesky questions.

454
00:20:41,458 --> 00:20:43,166
Hey! What? You lied!

455
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:46,000
That's only good news for you,
it's all bad for me!

456
00:20:46,083 --> 00:20:47,375
Yeah, you're right.

457
00:20:47,458 --> 00:20:49,791
And that brings me
to the bad news.

458
00:20:49,875 --> 00:20:52,625
You're gonna die without anyone
hearing you complain about it.

459
00:20:52,708 --> 00:20:54,500
Except me, and I don't care.

Did you...?

Don't get the wrong idea.

467

I just made some
arrests, that's all.

It misfired?

[DOUG]
Yeah, a bad cylinder.

470
00:21:19,958 --> 00:21:22,125
That thing's been sitting
on a shelf too long.

471
00:21:22,208 --> 00:21:24,375
And it's not much
more than a toy.

472
00:21:24,458 --> 00:21:26,458
[KIRILL]
I see.

473
00:21:26,541 --> 00:21:29,416
Revenge is old-fashioned,
remember?

00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:31,208
Damn straight!

00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:38,250
Move! That as fast
as you can walk?

Paul woke up a little while ago.

477
00:21:44,333 --> 00:21:46,666
Just got off the phone
with the hospital.

478
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:49,083
That's good news.
Thanks for sharing.

479
00:21:49,166 --> 00:21:51,208
I am curious, though, Doug.

480
00:21:51,291 --> 00:21:52,250
That gun.

481
00:21:52,333 --> 00:21:54,000
You were sure it
was going to misfire

482
00:21:54,083 --> 00:21:56,416
when you pulled the
trigger, weren't you?

483
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:58,375
Well, uh...

484
00:22:00,458 --> 00:22:01,375
[KIRILL]
Interesting.

485
00:22:01,458 --> 00:22:02,833
Guess this means
your "old partner"

486
00:22:02,916 --> 00:22:05,500
didn't really want
revenge after all.

487
00:22:05,583 --> 00:22:07,291
That's why the gun misfired.

488
00:22:07,375 --> 00:22:09,458
She had to stop it.

489
00:22:09,541 --> 00:22:11,166
[gasps]

490
00:22:13,791 --> 00:22:14,708
Yes.

491
00:22:14,791 --> 00:22:15,916
I knew it.

492
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:16,916
[TRAVIS]
Right!

493
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,583
All's well that
ends well, folks!

494
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,041
My partner set me straight.

495
00:22:28,125 --> 00:22:29,500
He told me

496
00:22:29,583 --> 00:22:32,250
a young girl would prefer
something like this.

497
00:22:32,333 --> 00:22:34,583
No more guns or whiskey.

498
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:38,041
[DOUG]
You know something?

499
00:22:38,125 --> 00:22:40,791
I imagine that you two
would've been good friends.

00:24:11,708 --> 00:24:13,750
[NARRATOR] An incident breaks
out at a local high school,

501
00:24:13,833 --> 00:24:16,000
and Max's mysterious
past is revealed!

502
00:24:16,083 --> 00:24:17,708
Guess we'll find out
how little Maxine

503
00:24:17,791 --> 00:24:19,291
became the Max we know and love!

504
00:24:19,375 --> 00:24:20,583
Next time, on <i>Double Decker</i> !

Episode Eight: "Dancing!
Academy Investigation!"

506
00:24:23,541 --> 00:24:24,875
Hey! No dancing in
the meeting room!

507
00:24:24,958 --> 00:24:26,250
Take the party outside!
