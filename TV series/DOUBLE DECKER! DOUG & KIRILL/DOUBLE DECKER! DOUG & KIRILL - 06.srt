A few days ago, on the 27th,

Hey, man.

It's been five whole days now.

weren't looking, do you?

00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:37,166
It seems weird that
a wanted pack mule

00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:39,333

place as his hideout,

it came from P and Q,

But, they think he might
be on drugs, too,

cover their bases

00:07:04,625 --> 00:07:06,291

There's always two suns. Duh.

158
00:07:06,375 --> 00:07:09,166

Oh, yeah, that's right. [laughs]

00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:11,250

Yeah, he might be a user.

Eh. No bruises, though.

161
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:16,125
So, you're some kind
of leader, mister?

162
00:07:16,208 --> 00:07:17,458
[DRUNKARD 6A]
Leader?

163
00:07:17,541 --> 00:07:19,791
[DOUG] The leader of
an organization, right?

164
00:07:19,875 --> 00:07:21,166
[DRUNKARD 6A]
Oh, right, right.

165

I'm pretty much the
leader of Esmeralda!

You ever heard of Esmeralda,
girly-face Tenderfoot?

[KIRILL] Well, sure.
Of course I've heard of it.

00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:33,833
[DRUNKARD 6A]
Ha, ha! Yeah? Well, I haven't.

171
00:07:33,916 --> 00:07:35,083
[KIRILL]
Huh?!

172
00:07:35,166 --> 00:07:36,541
[SHOW HOST] The man most
likely had far too much

173
00:07:36,625 --> 00:07:38,750
to drink, as his thoughts
seemed to drift in and out,

174
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:40,500
between reality and fantasy.

175
00:07:40,583 --> 00:07:43,000
However, the officers know
exactly how to handle him.

176
00:07:43,083 --> 00:07:44,625
Though they seem to
simply be listening,

177
00:07:44,708 --> 00:07:46,416
the truth is much more nuanced.

178
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:47,958
[DRUNKARD 6A]
So, where's the mayor, then?

179
00:07:48,041 --> 00:07:49,416
Shouldn't he be here by now?

180
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,291
[KIRILL] Why do you need
to talk the mayor, sir?

181
00:07:51,375 --> 00:07:53,750
[DRUNKARD 6A] This world is

Hey, officer.
You get it, don'tcha?

[DOUG]
Sure do.

185
00:07:58,791 --> 00:08:00,625
[DRUNKARD 6A] And I'm the one
who found out the truth!

186
00:08:00,708 --> 00:08:02,875
They're using us
all as guinea pigs!

187
00:08:02,958 --> 00:08:04,833
And if anything's gonna change,

188
00:08:04,916 --> 00:08:07,500
we've gotta let somebody pretty
important know about it!

189
00:08:07,583 --> 00:08:09,291
[DOUG] Yeah, sure.
I think you're right.

190
00:08:09,375 --> 00:08:11,500
[DRUNKARD 6A] Right, but that's
not as easy as you'd think,

191
00:08:11,583 --> 00:08:12,916
you know. 'Cause I ain't

Well, which is it?

00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:15,333
[DOUG]
Okay, sit still,

194
00:08:15,416 --> 00:08:17,375
we're just gonna run
a quick test on you.

195
00:08:17,458 --> 00:08:19,750
[DRUNKARD 6A]
A test? What kind of test?

196
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:22,375
[DOUG] We just have to find
out if you're sick or not.

197
00:08:22,458 --> 00:08:24,916
[DRUNKARD 6A] Hey!
You're a doctor and an officer?

198
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,500
'Cause that's crazy!

199
00:08:26,583 --> 00:08:29,041
[DOUG] Nah, I ain't a doctor,
and I'm not an officer, either.

200
00:08:29,125 --> 00:08:31,083
[DRUNKARD 6A] I'm not sick,
okay! Please, no tests!

201
00:08:31,166 --> 00:08:32,541
[DOUG]
I know you're not sick.

202
00:08:32,625 --> 00:08:35,166
'Cause if you were, you'd've
called a doctor, not us.

203
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:37,500
[DRUNKARD 6A] Ha, ha. Yeah,

[SHOW HOST]
The veteran knows the ropes.

205

He easily keeps the confused
drunk off his guard,

206
00:08:41,708 --> 00:08:43,333
while he and the rookie
start running tests

207
00:08:43,416 --> 00:08:46,125
for various narcotics.
Eventually, the drunk begins

208
00:08:46,208 --> 00:08:49,083
to trust the pair, and he slowly
starts to calm down.

209
00:08:49,166 --> 00:08:51,708
[DRUNKARD 6A]
Hey, when do I get to go home?

210
00:08:51,791 --> 00:08:54,458
[DOUG] Eh. We're almost done,
so hold tight, okay?

211
00:08:54,541 --> 00:08:58,500
[DRUNKARD 6A groans]
Hey, detective.

212
00:08:58,583 --> 00:08:59,916
Am I arrested?

213
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,333
Do I get to go home?

214
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:03,375
[DOUG] Sure, if we don't find
anything, you're free.

215
00:09:03,458 --> 00:09:05,333
[DRUNKARD 6A] I got a ton of
missed calls from my wife,

216
00:09:05,416 --> 00:09:06,208
and that's bad!

[KIRILL]
Of course you do,

218
00:09:07,291 --> 00:09:08,583
you've been out
drinking, mister.

219
00:09:08,666 --> 00:09:11,250
[DRUNKARD 6A cries]
She's gonna be so pissed!

220
00:09:11,333 --> 00:09:12,458
[DOUG]
Is your wife that scary?

221
00:09:12,541 --> 00:09:14,125
[DRUNKARD 6A]
I'm sorry, detective!

222
00:09:14,208 --> 00:09:16,791
Can't we just let this go and
pretend it never happened?

223
00:09:16,875 --> 00:09:19,458
[DOUG] That sounds like a
question for your wife, not me.

224
00:09:19,541 --> 00:09:21,333
[DRUNKARD 6A] Look, can you
be a real buddy and put in

225
00:09:21,416 --> 00:09:23,541
a good word for me
with her? Please?

[SHOW HOST]
In the end,

227
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:26,208
all the drug tests
came back negative,

228
00:09:26,291 --> 00:09:28,291
and the detectives were relieved
to find that the drunk

229
00:09:28,375 --> 00:09:30,041
wasn't some big crime boss.

230
00:09:30,125 --> 00:09:31,666
The suspect was given
a stern warning,

231
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:33,500
before being released
to the care of his wife,

232
00:09:33,583 --> 00:09:35,291
with whom he
returned home safely.

233
00:09:35,375 --> 00:09:37,750
She apologized profusely
for the disturbance.

00:09:37,833 --> 00:09:39,375
Goodbye, sir!

235

Make sure you pace yourself if
you drink again in the future!

That's the dumbest

Well, it's not likely to lead to

Yeah. Sophie said
the same. I'm glad.

[DOUG]
Don't rush it.

310
00:12:43,083 --> 00:12:44,750
We don't get a chance
like this often.

311
00:12:44,833 --> 00:12:47,375
So, we gotta be careful
not to spook our target.

312
00:12:47,458 --> 00:12:51,291
[KIRILL] Come on, it's not
like we're after a criminal!

313
00:12:51,375 --> 00:12:53,666
Yeah. I guess we don't
want to be abrupt.

314
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:56,708
Oh, man. Who knew
I'd be so nervous?

315
00:12:56,791 --> 00:12:58,291
Hey, Doug.

316
00:12:58,375 --> 00:13:00,291
What do you think I should say,
when we're finally face-to-face?

317
00:13:00,375 --> 00:13:01,791
[DOUG]
Hm?

318
00:13:01,875 --> 00:13:04,041
It's best to act natural,
like it's no big deal, right?

319
00:13:04,125 --> 00:13:06,791
I'm sure it's gonna
be quite a shock.

320
00:13:06,875 --> 00:13:09,916
Uh... Well. I mean,
it is shocking.

321
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:10,875
I guess.

322
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:13,291
I have no idea what to say.

323
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:15,291
No need to say anything
out of the ordinary.

324
00:13:15,375 --> 00:13:17,791
Best to keep it simple!
I think so, too!

325
00:13:17,875 --> 00:13:19,000
[DOUG]
Hm?

326
00:13:19,083 --> 00:13:20,333
[KIRILL]
It's so surreal,

327
00:13:20,416 --> 00:13:23,125
how life puts people right
in your path sometimes.

328
00:13:23,208 --> 00:13:24,666
[DOUG]
That's how it seems to work.

329
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:27,416
[KIRILL] But, how did you know
to come here, of all places?

330
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:28,750
[DOUG]
The security cameras.

331
00:13:28,833 --> 00:13:31,291
Marinaurben is a
very affluent area.

332
00:13:31,375 --> 00:13:33,458
Lots of money means
more protection.

333
00:13:33,541 --> 00:13:36,458
So, every part of town is
covered by these cameras.

334
00:13:36,541 --> 00:13:39,666
There's hardly a square inch
out of sight around here.

They're pretty helpful.

337
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,666
If you know what your
target looks like, well,

338
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:46,083
then they're much
easier to trace.

339
00:13:46,166 --> 00:13:48,041
I guess that makes sense.

340
00:13:48,125 --> 00:13:50,291
[DOUG] But, since there's so
much footage to wade through,

341
00:13:50,375 --> 00:13:52,125
you gotta put a lot
of man hours into it.

342
00:13:52,208 --> 00:13:53,416
That's the hard part.

Yeah.

364
00:14:48,583 --> 00:14:51,125
I saw my missing sister in the
Police Twenty-four video, too.

365
00:14:51,208 --> 00:14:53,791
So, the whole time, I thought
this was about finding her.

366
00:14:53,875 --> 00:14:56,375
I remember you saying
you wanted to find her,

367
00:14:56,458 --> 00:14:58,916
but how would I even know
what she looked like?

368
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
I thought that part
was kinda weird.

369
00:15:01,083 --> 00:15:03,708
But I just figured
you were smart.

370
00:15:03,791 --> 00:15:06,125
And you're absolutely sure
the woman you saw was her?

371
00:15:06,208 --> 00:15:07,708
Uh. Yeah.

372
00:15:07,791 --> 00:15:10,708
I guess we could look through
the footage, from the cameras.

373
00:15:10,791 --> 00:15:11,916
[KIRILL]
Well. I mean,

374
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
she's not a criminal
or anything like that.

375
00:15:14,083 --> 00:15:15,666
Would they even
give us access to it

376
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:17,333
just for a regular citizen?

377
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:19,375
There is another way.

378
00:15:20,041 --> 00:15:22,500
[DOUG] He's got some kind
of weird system in place.

379
00:15:22,583 --> 00:15:24,875
One that allows him to watch all
the security camera footage

Since you last saw her.

Uh. Since I was about 10
years old, and Milla was 19.

400
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,875
So, a full decade.

And is she your only family?

Well, there was Grandfather.

We weren't related
by blood, though.

So... Your grandfather,
what's he like?

00:16:30,541 --> 00:16:33,833
Do you still live with
your grandfather, then?

00:16:33,916 --> 00:16:36,958
I don't. While I was

[DOUG]
I see.

412
00:16:42,833 --> 00:16:45,208
Grandfather was the
difficult, quiet type.

413
00:16:45,291 --> 00:16:48,333
I make up that he and Milla
didn't get along very well.

414
00:16:48,416 --> 00:16:51,708
But I was just a kid, so I don't
know if I remember it right.

You weren't able to trace her?

No, she went into a public
restroom after this.

she'd feel guilty about?

Why do you ask?

426
00:17:30,833 --> 00:17:32,458
[APPLE] She seems to
be intentionally avoiding

427

Oh. Well, there's

Okay. Well, don't let

So, there's a high
probability that's her.

to find something.

about her identity
and background,

00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,666
but I'm ignoring
that red flag 'cause,

00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:37,000
like the name of
the bar implies,

it's my place and
I do whatever I want.

would've told you sooner.

465
00:18:58,666 --> 00:19:00,833
So, why'd you abandon
your little brother?

466
00:19:00,916 --> 00:19:02,208
[DERICK]
Yeah. Tell us why!

467
00:19:02,291 --> 00:19:03,416
Deana, stop!

468
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:06,500
It's fine. I had no
good reason, honestly.

469
00:19:06,583 --> 00:19:08,791
Just young and stupid, I guess.

470
00:19:08,875 --> 00:19:10,583
[DEANA] Well, where have you
been hiding all these years?

471
00:19:10,666 --> 00:19:12,000
Oh, you know, here and there.

472
00:19:12,083 --> 00:19:14,208
[KAY] What led you to seek
work here, of all places?

473
00:19:14,291 --> 00:19:16,291
I wanted to work in a bar
that wouldn't be likely

474
00:19:16,375 --> 00:19:19,166
to draw big crowds,
and this place fit the bill.

475
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:21,416
Because you...
don't like attention?

476
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:24,083
Yeah, I guess.
Or something like that.

477
00:19:24,166 --> 00:19:25,708
Then this place is perfect!

478
00:19:25,791 --> 00:19:27,333
I can't see it ever
being popular--

479
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:30,750
to be honest, he probably
shouldn't've hired staff.

480
00:19:30,833 --> 00:19:32,208
[DERICK grunts]

481
00:19:32,291 --> 00:19:34,458
I'm just glad you're
doing well, Kirill.

482
00:19:34,541 --> 00:19:37,375
So, you're a police officer?

483
00:19:37,458 --> 00:19:38,958
Say something, stupid!

484
00:19:39,041 --> 00:19:40,708
What's wrong? Well?

485
00:19:40,791 --> 00:19:43,500
Weren't you going
to ask her something?

486
00:19:44,708 --> 00:19:46,625
You're wrong, kid.

487
00:19:46,708 --> 00:19:48,458
You don't want to
know why she left.

488
00:19:48,541 --> 00:19:50,958
There's another question
that's eating you up inside.

489
00:19:51,041 --> 00:19:53,000
What you're really dying
to ask is why your sister

490
00:19:53,083 --> 00:19:54,750
didn't take you with her.

491
00:19:54,833 --> 00:19:59,166
When you dig right down to
the bedrock, that's the truth.

492
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:00,333
Maybe.

493
00:20:00,416 --> 00:20:02,833
I'm sure she had a
good reason for that.

494
00:20:06,708 --> 00:20:09,541
[DOUG] Sparrows and swallows
can't comprehend the aspirations

495
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:12,750
of phoenixes and swans.
Know what I mean?

496
00:20:15,041 --> 00:20:17,541
That's true.

497
00:20:17,625 --> 00:20:21,583
Sparrows, swallows,
phoenixes, and swans.

498
00:20:21,666 --> 00:20:23,666
[DOUG] It's cool if you don't
know what that means.

499
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:26,250
Yeah. I'll look it up later.

500
00:20:28,375 --> 00:20:29,750
[MILLA grunts]

501
00:20:29,833 --> 00:20:33,333
[KIRILL] It's okay. We don't
have to talk about it now.

502
00:20:33,416 --> 00:20:36,250
What matters is we got
to see each other.

503
00:20:36,333 --> 00:20:38,083
Thanks, Kirill.

504
00:20:39,708 --> 00:20:43,541
Someday, whenever
you feel ready to,

505
00:20:43,625 --> 00:20:45,500
you can tell me then.

506
00:20:45,583 --> 00:20:47,708
Ha, ha! Aw, baby
brother's crying!

507
00:20:47,791 --> 00:20:49,208
[KIRILL]
I am not!

508
00:20:49,291 --> 00:20:52,000
[KAY] There's nothing wrong
with being emotional, okay?

509
00:20:52,083 --> 00:20:53,958
What the hell are you
blubbering about?!

510
00:20:54,041 --> 00:20:56,125
It makes sense for this guy
to be all weepy, but you?

511
00:20:56,208 --> 00:20:59,375
You all seem to be such
a close-knit group.

512
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:00,916
It's quite a relief.

513
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,666
I was worried, but it seems
like my little brother

514
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:05,291
has made some great friends.

515
00:21:05,375 --> 00:21:07,125
I don't know.
They're not friends.

516
00:21:07,208 --> 00:21:09,708
That's the wrong word.

517
00:21:09,791 --> 00:21:12,250
[DOUG]
Yeah. We're comrades.

518
00:22:42,333 --> 00:22:45,708
[KIRILL snores]

519
00:22:45,791 --> 00:22:47,208
Wake up, buddy, time to go.

520
00:22:47,291 --> 00:22:49,291
[KIRILL grunts]
Okay.

521
00:22:49,375 --> 00:22:50,833
Little boys' room's that way.

522
00:22:50,916 --> 00:22:53,208
Yeah, yeah, I know that!

523
00:22:55,791 --> 00:22:59,000
[APPLE] Doug! Do you ever
answer your phone?!

524
00:22:59,083 --> 00:23:00,208
[DOUG]
Oh, Doctor.

525
00:23:00,291 --> 00:23:02,791
I forgot to invite
you out. My bad.

526
00:23:02,875 --> 00:23:05,833
No, I don't care.
I mean, yes I do!

527
00:23:05,916 --> 00:23:07,125
Damn, which is it?

528
00:23:07,208 --> 00:23:08,333
[APPLE]
I, uh, found something out

529
00:23:08,416 --> 00:23:10,500
that Kirill might want to know.

530
00:23:15,291 --> 00:23:16,541
[MILLA grunts]

531
00:23:16,625 --> 00:23:19,000
[yelps] Milla!

532
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:21,166
Seriously?

533
00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:23,750
Yeah! A security camera at
the train station recorded it.

534
00:23:23,833 --> 00:23:25,166
Kirill's sister very clearly

535
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:28,333
went into the men's
restroom there.

536
00:23:28,416 --> 00:23:31,250
But, like.
Why were you watching?

537
00:23:31,333 --> 00:23:33,708
Doug asked me to look into
the whole sister thing.

538
00:23:33,791 --> 00:23:36,583
Uh! I-- I-I wasn't trying
to peep in the bathrooms,

539
00:23:36,666 --> 00:23:37,916
if that's what
you're all thinking!

540
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,625
I'm creating a support system!

541
00:23:39,708 --> 00:23:41,833
[DEANA] Uh, nobody was
even thinking that.

542
00:23:41,916 --> 00:23:43,333
Back up to the man part.

543
00:23:43,416 --> 00:23:45,250
Nobody understands what
you're trying to say.

544
00:23:45,333 --> 00:23:49,250
Oh. I see. I wasn't
peeping, though.

545
00:23:49,333 --> 00:23:51,166
[sputters]

546
00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:54,375
[MILLA] I'm sorry I never told
you the truth about me, Kirill.

547
00:23:54,458 --> 00:23:56,791
My given name
isn't Milla, actually.

548
00:23:56,875 --> 00:23:58,416
[gasping]

549
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:01,041
[MILLA] That's how
you know me, but...

550
00:24:01,125 --> 00:24:03,166
My real name is Valery Vrubel.

551
00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:05,250
[KIRILL gasps]

552
00:24:05,333 --> 00:24:07,708
I planned to
tell you eventually.

553
00:24:12,125 --> 00:24:13,416
[NARRATOR]
Kirill finally reunites

554
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:14,791
with his estranged sister!

555
00:24:14,875 --> 00:24:16,833
But then, that other idiot
decides to take action,

556
00:24:16,916 --> 00:24:19,250
lest we forget there's another
protagonist in this show!

557
00:24:19,333 --> 00:24:20,625
They're all so insecure!

558
00:24:20,708 --> 00:24:21,958
Next time on <i>Double Decker,</i>

559
00:24:22,041 --> 00:24:24,166
episode Seven:
"Revenge is Mine!"

560
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:26,041
You should be watching!
