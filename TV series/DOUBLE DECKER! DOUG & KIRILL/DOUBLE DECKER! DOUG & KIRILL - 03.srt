[APPLE] How long's it take

About 4.5 seconds.

We don't have to be

Just call me "Kirill,"

Did you hear what I just said?!

44
00:03:27,125 --> 00:03:29,500
[TRAVIS] They pick up the
stuff in the Ignuscastrum

someone they call

00:03:31,833 --> 00:03:34,083
"Bamboo Man,"
which is pretty lame.

47
00:03:34,166 --> 00:03:37,625
He's always wearing a mask,
so they've never seen his face.

48
00:03:37,708 --> 00:03:40,208
But he's got jewels for teeth,
as you can see here.

49
00:03:40,291 --> 00:03:42,541
Kinda defeats the
purpose of the mask.

50
00:03:42,625 --> 00:03:44,791
The buyer has no idea
where this Bamboo cat

And that's where we come in.

Actually, I think it would be

it's a local outfit.

[WORKERS] We won't be
treated like factory--!

160
00:07:43,625 --> 00:07:44,708
We don't get days off,

161
00:07:44,791 --> 00:07:47,041
and we barely even
get paid for our work.

162
00:07:47,125 --> 00:07:49,166
I can't afford to buy
milk for my daughter,

163

let alone new socks!

164
00:07:50,708 --> 00:07:51,708
Whoa, seriously?

165
00:07:51,791 --> 00:07:52,708
Yeah, why?

00:07:52,791 --> 00:07:54,041
[KIRILL]
Uh. Nothing, uh--

167
00:07:54,125 --> 00:07:56,250
So, tell me, how long have
you all been on strike?

168
00:07:56,333 --> 00:07:58,708
[sighs] It's coming
up on six months.

You've been out of

I'm sorry.

00:08:18,083 --> 00:08:20,125
I have an advanced lung disease.

Oh, that's awful.

179
00:08:21,708 --> 00:08:26,041
And he got it from exposure
to the factory's gas fumes!

The owners lie, claiming to have
no knowledge of its effect.

His health's faded.

182
00:08:31,166 --> 00:08:33,333
He destroyed it trying
to help others.

183

To make sure no one else
had to endure his plight.

184
00:08:36,333 --> 00:08:38,500
Really? Why go so far?

185
00:08:38,583 --> 00:08:40,583
They built this empire
on the workers' backs,

186
00:08:40,666 --> 00:08:43,083
exploiting and abusing us
the whole time.

00:08:43,166 --> 00:08:46,541
I refuse to roll over and
let them get away with it.

[DOUG]
Oh, sorry.

192

[HARRY] These things happen.
You need some help?

[KIRILL]
Good job, Kay!

195
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:07,083
I hope management
agrees to our terms soon

196
00:09:07,166 --> 00:09:09,208

Hang in there, okay?

00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,708
Didn't see our guy.

The Bamboo Man.

202
00:09:19,958 --> 00:09:21,708
No union members
had jeweled teeth.

203
00:09:21,791 --> 00:09:25,708
Although, I can't imagine he
would be a union worker.

204
00:09:25,791 --> 00:09:27,583
Those men can't
even buy socks!

205
00:09:27,666 --> 00:09:29,500
How could they afford
jeweled teeth?

206
00:09:29,583 --> 00:09:31,250
I suspect the factory fat cats!

207
00:09:31,333 --> 00:09:32,625
Fine. To the factory, then.

208
00:09:32,708 --> 00:09:33,708
[KAY, KIRILL]
Huh?

209
00:09:33,791 --> 00:09:36,833
Whelp. This here
is the factory floor.

[DOUG] Is that so
you can pouch the oil?

[KIRILL] I guess this is
what he was talking about.

00:09:40,416 --> 00:09:42,333
[TOMMY] No, that's left over

213
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:43,500
[DOUG]
Left over?

214
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:45,541
We used to manufacture
asphalt, plastics,

petroleum products,

[FACTORY WORKERS cough]

218
00:09:49,833 --> 00:09:52,083
[TOMMY] All we do is load
the refined heavy oil

00:09:52,166 --> 00:09:54,458

[KIRILL] Are you willing to
negotiate with the union?

222
00:09:57,875 --> 00:09:59,125
What are you doing?

223
00:09:59,208 --> 00:10:00,875
Look, kid, if we listened
to every little thing

224
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:03,375
the union bitched about,
we'd be out of business

before the end of the week.

226
00:10:04,666 --> 00:10:05,666
But Harry and those guys

227
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:07,541
contracted lung
disease working here!

228
00:10:07,625 --> 00:10:10,291
[TOMMY] You got any proof
to back up that claim?

229
00:10:10,375 --> 00:10:11,625
What else could it be?!

230
00:10:11,708 --> 00:10:13,416
[TOMMY] When you jump
to conclusions like that,

231
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,250
you cost good men their jobs.

232
00:10:15,333 --> 00:10:18,458
It makes things worse for
all of us in the long run.

Well, we're in the middle

of doing maintenance
on it right now.

Don't you have better things

Then I guess we'll just have

to talk about Doug.

314
00:13:50,708 --> 00:13:53,291
Derick was the best
partner a cop could have.

315
00:13:53,375 --> 00:13:55,166
[KIRILL gasps]

316
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:57,708
He had fantastic intuition,

317
00:13:57,791 --> 00:14:01,041
and knew exactly how to
support Mr. Billingham.

318
00:14:01,125 --> 00:14:03,916
I miss him quite a bit.

319
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,291
It's sad to think I'll never
see them in action again.

320
00:14:08,375 --> 00:14:11,458
Also, you'd better bring back
the gun you swiped from my lab--

321
00:14:11,541 --> 00:14:12,291
Hello.

322
00:14:12,375 --> 00:14:13,375
[gasps]

323
00:14:13,458 --> 00:14:16,250
Wanna go grab something
to eat with me?

324
00:14:16,791 --> 00:14:17,958
[KAY] I've been hoping
to get a chance

325
00:14:18,041 --> 00:14:20,916
to talk to you alone
for a while, Kirill.

326
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,750
But this trip's
been super-crazy.

327
00:14:22,833 --> 00:14:25,041
We've been busy
ever since we got here.

328
00:14:25,125 --> 00:14:27,083
Tonight'll be my big
chance, though!

329
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:28,708
[KIRILL]
What's she doing?

330
00:14:28,791 --> 00:14:30,666
Is this her way of trying
to make me feel better,

331
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:32,833
or something? Why
would she do that?

332
00:14:32,916 --> 00:14:34,916
I wanted to thank you
for the donuts, too.

333
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,125
[KIRILL]
Oh, crap!

334
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:38,208
Did I worm my way into
her heart instead?!

335
00:14:38,291 --> 00:14:39,958
[KAY]
Oh! This is the place!

336
00:14:40,041 --> 00:14:42,208
[KIRILL] She even picked out
a special restaurant for us!

337
00:14:42,291 --> 00:14:44,500
Ignis pie! I've always
wanted to try it...

338
00:14:44,583 --> 00:14:46,083
[KIRILL] And look at all
those bookmarks!

339
00:14:46,166 --> 00:14:47,916
She really went all out!

340
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,750
That's just adorable!

341
00:14:49,833 --> 00:14:52,000
[NARRATOR] Kirill was making
more of this than it was.

342
00:14:52,083 --> 00:14:53,458
She's not into him at all!

343
00:14:53,541 --> 00:14:55,500
She's just a raging foodie!

344
00:14:55,583 --> 00:14:57,541
I mean, we're here, right?
We have to enjoy

345
00:14:57,625 --> 00:14:59,625
the local delicacies,
or we'll be missing out!

346
00:14:59,708 --> 00:15:01,791
How sweet.
She really cares.

347
00:15:01,875 --> 00:15:04,500
It's too awkward to come and
eat in a place like this alone.

348
00:15:04,583 --> 00:15:06,375
I feel so valued, what a gal!

349
00:15:06,458 --> 00:15:10,125
[NARRATOR] These kids
don't know how to listen!

350
00:15:10,208 --> 00:15:13,625
[HARRY] He who refuses to listen
is no better than swine.

351
00:15:13,708 --> 00:15:18,041
Blind to his foolishness, until
the butcher chops off his head.

352
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:21,000
[JOEL] That's insulting
to pigs, don't ya think?

353
00:15:21,083 --> 00:15:24,875
Thigs are delicious, but they're
smarter than most other animals.

354
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:26,083
[HARRY grunts]

355
00:15:26,166 --> 00:15:27,708
[phone ringing]

356
00:15:29,041 --> 00:15:31,708
[HARRY] It all worked out
exactly as I said it would.

357
00:15:31,791 --> 00:15:34,208
[TOMMY] Do you think that means
the heat's off of us?

358
00:15:34,291 --> 00:15:36,416
[HARRY]
Yeah, but stay sharp anyway.

359
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:40,041
[TOMMY] So, you don't think
they're angry with us, do you?

360
00:15:40,125 --> 00:15:41,375
[HARRY]
Everything's fine.

361
00:15:41,458 --> 00:15:43,791
I'm on my way to
the deal site now.

362
00:15:43,875 --> 00:15:46,666
[TOMMY] I'd really like to meet
this Bamboo Man someday.

363
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:48,500
Is that so--

364
00:15:48,583 --> 00:15:50,583
You are not worthy of that.

365
00:15:50,666 --> 00:15:52,916
You're nothing more than swine.

366
00:15:57,833 --> 00:15:59,666
Let's get outta here.

367
00:16:00,708 --> 00:16:02,125
[DOUG]
So, the gondolas themselves

368
00:16:02,208 --> 00:16:05,208
were the transport method.
That's a pretty clever ruse.

369
00:16:05,291 --> 00:16:07,333
It got you through
the checkpoints.

370
00:16:07,416 --> 00:16:09,500
You're with that
TV station, right?

371
00:16:09,583 --> 00:16:11,875
What are you doin'
out here this late?

372
00:16:11,958 --> 00:16:14,833
[DOUG] I didn't trust you,
right from the beginning.

373
00:16:14,916 --> 00:16:16,458
So, I kept an eye on you.

374
00:16:16,541 --> 00:16:18,708
Whoa, what are you
talkin' about?

375
00:16:18,791 --> 00:16:21,250
[DOUG]
You saw that ridiculous picture.

376
00:16:21,333 --> 00:16:23,458
When the papers
fell to the floor.

377
00:16:23,541 --> 00:16:27,000
I clocked your panic
when you did.

378
00:16:27,083 --> 00:16:29,750
And if you did have any sort of
connection to the Bamboo Man

379
00:16:29,833 --> 00:16:32,833
matter, I knew seeing that photo
would spur you into action.

380
00:16:32,916 --> 00:16:35,083
[HARRY] Of course I looked
at that stupid photo.

381
00:16:35,166 --> 00:16:36,291
Who wouldn't have a reaction

382
00:16:36,375 --> 00:16:38,041
to seeing a man with
rubies for teeth?

383
00:16:38,125 --> 00:16:39,750
You saw that much?

384
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:40,750
I'm surprised you
could even tell

385
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:42,041
it was a shot of a man's face.

386
00:16:42,125 --> 00:16:43,208
[HARRY gasps]

387
00:16:43,291 --> 00:16:45,041
You realized in that
moment that someone

388
00:16:45,125 --> 00:16:47,208
was onto your little
operation here.

389
00:16:47,291 --> 00:16:49,333
So, you called
the factory foreman.

390
00:16:49,416 --> 00:16:52,250
Gave him a heads up to hide
the goods and let us in.

391
00:16:52,333 --> 00:16:54,166
And then you sent out
the trucks as decoys

392
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:56,708
to distract us from
the real drop.

393
00:16:56,791 --> 00:16:59,208
You'd shake us clean
off your tails.

394
00:16:59,291 --> 00:17:02,250
So, you could go right back
to selling the Anthem.

395
00:17:02,333 --> 00:17:04,708
[HARRY] These accusations
are absolutely ridiculous.

396
00:17:04,791 --> 00:17:06,500
What proof do you have
to back them up?

397
00:17:06,583 --> 00:17:10,708
Instinct and hunches aren't
probable cause, by the way.

398
00:17:10,791 --> 00:17:12,750
Tell me about that
book of poems.

399
00:17:12,833 --> 00:17:16,625
What, factory men aren't
allowed to read poetry?

400
00:17:16,708 --> 00:17:18,125
[DOUG]
That one you had.

401
00:17:18,208 --> 00:17:19,666
It's a limited edition.

402
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:22,125
I saw the serial number.

403
00:17:23,541 --> 00:17:25,458
[DOUG] You could buy a
year's worth of new socks

404
00:17:25,541 --> 00:17:28,125
with that kind of scratch.

405

[growls]

406
00:17:29,541 --> 00:17:31,125
[DOUG] Why don't we continue
this at the station?

[HARRY]
Shut your mouth!

414
00:17:47,416 --> 00:17:50,166
Just clear out everything that
hasn't been pouched yet.

415
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:52,458
[TOMMY] Why not just burn
the place down?

416
00:17:52,541 --> 00:17:55,250
Destroy the evidence, and we
can collect insurance, too!

417
00:17:55,333 --> 00:17:57,125
Burn the Anthem? Why?

418
00:17:57,208 --> 00:17:58,375
Hell no!

419

in the world is Anthem?

set fire to the place,

that I was in danger.

what drove me to do this.

00:20:10,541 --> 00:20:12,333
Anthem induced Overdrive!

470
00:20:12,416 --> 00:20:13,916
That's great, Tommy!

471
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,833
Now be a pal and crush
these detectives, will ya?

472
00:20:16,916 --> 00:20:19,875
You shut your mouth!
I don't take orders anymore!

473
00:20:19,958 --> 00:20:21,333
Tommy, no.

474
00:20:21,416 --> 00:20:23,958
You always leave me out
of important stuff.

475
00:20:24,041 --> 00:20:25,666
You make fun of me all the time!

476
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:28,583
[HARRY] We can talk about
that later, just kill them!

477
00:20:28,666 --> 00:20:31,833
I said... I don't take orders!

478
00:20:31,916 --> 00:20:33,416
[HARRY groans]

479
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,208
I am invincible!

480
00:20:35,291 --> 00:20:37,708
No one will make fun
of me ever again!

481
00:20:37,791 --> 00:20:40,875
No one can tell me what to do!

482
00:20:41,875 --> 00:20:42,875
[KAY]
Are you okay?

483
00:20:42,958 --> 00:20:45,666
Yeah. What the hell
happened here?

484
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:48,250
The foreman. He went
into Anthem Overdrive.

485
00:20:48,333 --> 00:20:49,583
He's lost control.

486
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:51,666
[DOUG]
Activating Eye System.

487
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:53,583
[TOMMY]
I am invincible!

488
00:20:53,666 --> 00:20:56,708
He's big, but he's fast,
too. I can't get a scan.

489
00:20:56,791 --> 00:20:59,166
Well, first... We've got to
slow him down somehow,

490
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:00,750
without getting
in too close.

491
00:21:00,833 --> 00:21:02,625
Invincible, are ya?

492
00:21:02,708 --> 00:21:03,791
[gasps]

493
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:05,666
[TOMMY]
Huh...?

494
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:08,625
Even now, you're still the
same loser no one listens to.

495
00:21:08,708 --> 00:21:09,875
You idiot!

496
00:21:09,958 --> 00:21:11,666
What did you say to me?

497
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:12,541
[TOMMY grunts]

498
00:21:12,625 --> 00:21:13,583
[gasps]

499
00:21:13,666 --> 00:21:15,000
[KIRILL]
All it'll take is one shot!

500
00:21:15,083 --> 00:21:17,416
I've got a gun in the car.
It's special.

501
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:20,833
Made specifically for morons
like you, you giant loaf!

502
00:21:20,916 --> 00:21:22,333
[KIRILL groans]

503
00:21:22,416 --> 00:21:24,208
[KAY]
Kirill, no!

504
00:21:24,291 --> 00:21:27,708
Doug! Hurry up and fire, now!

505
00:21:27,791 --> 00:21:29,291
I don't do things this way.

506
00:21:29,375 --> 00:21:30,500
It's reckless.

507
00:21:30,583 --> 00:21:32,791
I get it, fine! Just hurry!

508
00:21:32,875 --> 00:21:36,291
[exhales] Right.

509
00:21:36,375 --> 00:21:38,208
Time for your medicine.

510
00:21:38,291 --> 00:21:39,458
[gunshot]

511
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,791
[KIRILL] So, then, GG oil was
just a dummy company.

512
00:21:43,875 --> 00:21:45,583
They were subcontracted
to put the Anthem

513
00:21:45,666 --> 00:21:47,208
into patches for distribution?

514
00:21:47,291 --> 00:21:49,708
[DOUG]
Yeah. Oh, you'll like this.

515
00:21:49,791 --> 00:21:52,375
I heard the union guys are gonna
be rebuilding the factory.

516
00:21:52,458 --> 00:21:55,166
[KIRILL] That's great. They'll
be able to afford socks now.

517
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:56,791
Socks? Oh, right.

518
00:21:56,875 --> 00:21:57,875
[KIRILL]
Mm?

519
00:21:59,958 --> 00:22:02,375
[DOUG]
Here, got you a lighter model.

520
00:22:02,458 --> 00:22:04,458
Flashy and powerful.

521
00:22:04,541 --> 00:22:06,916
It's perfect for you, right?

522
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:11,416
[gasping] You got me this?

523
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:13,125
Hey, Doug!

524
00:22:13,208 --> 00:22:14,166
[DOUG]
Hm?

525
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:15,625
Could we talk about
your partner?

526
00:22:15,708 --> 00:22:18,125
You know, the one
who passed away.

527
00:22:18,208 --> 00:22:19,583
When you're ready to.

528
00:22:19,666 --> 00:22:22,666
A-And only if you're up
for it, of course.

529
00:22:23,958 --> 00:22:26,208
[APPLE]
Was that ridiculous gun for him?

530
00:22:26,291 --> 00:22:29,041
Makes sense. It suits
his personality, I guess.

531
00:22:29,125 --> 00:22:31,708
Huh? What are you
talking about?

532
00:22:35,125 --> 00:22:36,291
Bang! Bang!

533
00:22:36,375 --> 00:22:37,666
Bang!

534
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:40,500
[DOUG]
He's talking about my partner.

535
00:24:11,666 --> 00:24:13,375
[NARRATOR] Kirill renews his
resolve to be

536
00:24:13,458 --> 00:24:15,166
the best partner ever to Doug!

537
00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:16,541
But a terrible misunderstanding

538
00:24:16,625 --> 00:24:18,833
threatens to blow the whole
thing up in his face!

539
00:24:18,916 --> 00:24:20,833
That's right.
It was all in his head!

540
00:24:20,916 --> 00:24:22,333
Next time, on <i>Double Decker</i> !

541
00:24:22,416 --> 00:24:24,333
Episode four: "Derick returns!"

542
00:24:24,416 --> 00:24:26,208
Time for a dose
of reality, chump!
