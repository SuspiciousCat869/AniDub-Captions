00:07:04,375 --> 00:07:07,125
That's irrelevant.
Let's get to work.

163
00:07:07,208 --> 00:07:08,041
[KIRILL]
Hey, uh...

164
00:07:08,125 --> 00:07:10,375
A little help here? Maybe?

165
00:07:10,458 --> 00:07:13,083
I feel like a turtle.

166
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:16,083
[KIRILL] Huh?! Why do Doug and
Max get to do the questioning?

167
00:07:16,166 --> 00:07:18,125
Having both genders present
will make the students

168
00:07:18,208 --> 00:07:19,458
more comfortable,

169
00:07:19,541 --> 00:07:21,333
and who could take you
seriously in that get-up?

170
00:07:21,416 --> 00:07:22,916
It's not like I asked
to walk around here

171
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,166
dressed like a freak!

172
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:25,750
You and I will be there
to counsel the students

173
00:07:25,833 --> 00:07:26,791
having a hard time.

174
00:07:26,875 --> 00:07:28,791
Dressed like this?

175
00:07:28,875 --> 00:07:29,916
[DOUG]
You wanna switch?

176
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,166
Wait, do you mean that?

177
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:33,833
Seems like this would
be way easier.

178
00:07:33,916 --> 00:07:36,750
Fine, if that's really
what you want to do.

179
00:07:36,833 --> 00:07:39,166
[KIRILL]
Something's not right with her.

180
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:39,958
[CAMILLA]
Excuse me.

181
00:07:40,041 --> 00:07:40,666
[KIRILL]
Hm?

182
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:42,791
Do you have a moment?

183
00:07:42,875 --> 00:07:45,583
I just know Hannah's
the one behind all this!

184
00:07:45,666 --> 00:07:48,125
You guys are really here to
investigate the attacks, right?

185
00:07:48,208 --> 00:07:50,500
[ELLE] The whole school
is talking about it.

186
00:07:50,583 --> 00:07:52,208
[KIRILL chuckles nervously]

187
00:07:52,291 --> 00:07:54,583
Do you have any evidence
to back up your claim?

188
00:07:54,666 --> 00:07:56,375
You heard her at the assembly!

189
00:07:56,458 --> 00:07:58,250
She wants to sabotage
Elle's prom,

190
00:07:58,333 --> 00:08:00,750
and I wouldn't put it past
Hannah to resort to violence!

191
00:08:00,833 --> 00:08:02,250
Wait, aren't you Elle?

192
00:08:02,333 --> 00:08:04,291
[ELLE] And like, during the
nominations for prom queen,

193
00:08:04,375 --> 00:08:05,708
Elle totally came in first

194
00:08:05,791 --> 00:08:07,791
and her best friend,
Camilla, came in second.

195
00:08:07,875 --> 00:08:08,958
Right?

196
00:08:09,041 --> 00:08:10,166
Yeah.

197
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:11,666
We work really hard
every day to be as cute

198
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:13,583
as we possibly can, you know?

199
00:08:13,666 --> 00:08:15,000
It's not our fault she's ugly

200
00:08:15,083 --> 00:08:16,708
and won't put in the
work to be hotter!

201
00:08:16,791 --> 00:08:18,041
If that's the criminal's motive,

202
00:08:18,125 --> 00:08:19,625
it seems a little obvious,
don't you think?

203
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:24,083
I didn't mean-- Hey, Camilla,
maybe a little help here?

204
00:08:24,166 --> 00:08:26,416
[CAMILLA] The old school
building's there, on the hill.

205
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:27,875
That's where they
always hold the prom.

206
00:08:27,958 --> 00:08:29,000
[KIRILL]
Huh.

207
00:08:29,083 --> 00:08:30,541
[CAMILLA]
It's a historical landmark.

208
00:08:30,625 --> 00:08:32,000
So, they open it
up for the dance,

209
00:08:32,083 --> 00:08:34,000
but it stays closed for
the rest of the year.

210
00:08:34,083 --> 00:08:36,333
And the dance happens
to be tomorrow night.

211
00:08:36,416 --> 00:08:37,833
Everybody's looking
forward to it,

212
00:08:37,916 --> 00:08:39,833
so you can't let
them call it off!

213
00:08:39,916 --> 00:08:41,291
[MALE STUDENT 08D]
You're really pretty, miss!

214
00:08:41,375 --> 00:08:42,708
[MALE STUDENT 08E]
Do you have a boyfriend?

215
00:08:42,791 --> 00:08:45,000
I'm here to talk about drugs,
not my personal life.

216
00:08:45,083 --> 00:08:47,416
And like, besides, why do
the police even have a right

217
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:49,708
to just call off Elle's
prom in the first place?

218
00:08:49,791 --> 00:08:51,000
Whoa, relax.

219
00:08:51,083 --> 00:08:52,416
As far as Kirill knows,

220
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:55,041
nobody has any plans to
cancel your prom, okay?

221
00:08:55,125 --> 00:08:57,125
It's hot. What's
with the jacket?

222
00:08:57,208 --> 00:08:58,291
[ELLE]
Hm?

223
00:08:58,375 --> 00:09:00,500
And won't it get in
the way at practice?

224
00:09:00,583 --> 00:09:02,791
Well, you see, Elle gets
burnt really easily

225
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:04,416
on sunny days like today.

226
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:07,208
Oh, yeah? Sure you're
not hiding an injury?

227
00:09:07,291 --> 00:09:09,583
What?! Are you accusing
Elle of something?

228
00:09:09,666 --> 00:09:10,458
You don't mean--

229
00:09:10,541 --> 00:09:11,666
Max, ease up!

230
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:13,000
[ELLE] She's treating
me like a criminal,

231
00:09:13,083 --> 00:09:14,541
and I haven't done
anything wrong!

232
00:09:14,625 --> 00:09:16,375
[MAXINE] You've certainly
got a motive, though.

233
00:09:16,458 --> 00:09:17,708
You want to be prom queen.

234
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:19,958
So, you might be trying
to narrow the field.

235
00:09:20,041 --> 00:09:23,208
[ELLE] That lady cop is
just mean! Camilla!

236
00:09:23,291 --> 00:09:25,291
What about the other
nominee, Laura?

237
00:09:25,375 --> 00:09:27,375
She was always arguing with
Liza, who got attacked!

238
00:09:27,458 --> 00:09:29,833
[MAXINE] Guilty parties love
to suggest other suspects

239
00:09:29,916 --> 00:09:31,166
when nobody asked them.

240
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:33,541
So, you're not doing
yourself any favors here.

241

[KIRILL]
Max!

242
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:38,083
Don't be sad. No one's
gonna take our prom away.

243
00:09:38,166 --> 00:09:40,833
So don't you worry
about a thing, Elle.

244
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:44,958
[TRAVIS]
Come on, now, Boxer.

245
00:09:45,041 --> 00:09:47,708
I specifically said not
to upset the students.

246
00:09:47,791 --> 00:09:49,250
If you ruin my
shot at promotion,

[MAXINE] Pretty much exactly
what you'd expect him to.

250
00:09:54,958 --> 00:09:56,666
Four victims of
violence already,

251
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:59,083
and he still thinks the prom
should go on as planned?

252
00:09:59,166 --> 00:10:00,541
It's stupid and reckless.

253
00:10:00,625 --> 00:10:03,125
I think it's a good
distraction for the students.

254
00:10:03,208 --> 00:10:05,916
It's an important milestone
in their lives, you know?

Our opinions differ there.

There's nobody in the whole
world who's as perfect as him!

Word is one of the nominees
for queen is hot for him,

No way. It's gotta
be Hannah, dude.

I heard that Hannah
wants to be queen,

00:10:35,708 --> 00:10:38,583
so the cancel prom thing's an
act, just to get attention.

drug in my life, honest!

317
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:29,250
This isn't fair--
I'm being framed!

318
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:30,583
What did forensics say?

319
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:33,166
It'll be awhile before the
full report comes back,

320
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:34,541
but there's no
sign of Overdrive,

321
00:12:34,625 --> 00:12:35,750
or any use at all, really.

322
00:12:35,833 --> 00:12:36,958
So...

323
00:12:37,041 --> 00:12:38,250
But Chris here was still
caught in possession

324
00:12:38,333 --> 00:12:40,208
of both Anthem and
a lethal weapon.

325
00:12:40,291 --> 00:12:41,708
We can't rule out
the possibility

326
00:12:41,791 --> 00:12:42,875
that these two crimes,

327
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:44,625
while both Anthem-related,
might not be--

328
00:12:44,708 --> 00:12:46,291
[KIRILL] Are you suggesting
he's not our guy?!

329
00:12:46,375 --> 00:12:48,833
His motive. Have we determined
what that might be?

330
00:12:48,916 --> 00:12:51,083
We'll have to restart the
investigation from scratch.

331
00:12:51,166 --> 00:12:53,000
Until we've finished
the interrogation,

332
00:12:53,083 --> 00:12:55,125
none of us will be allowed
on school grounds.

Why not?

The real criminal could still
be at large and attack others.

[TRAVIS] Unfortunately, there's
nothing we can do about that.

But, once the prom is
over tomorrow night,

00:13:03,791 --> 00:13:05,208
it should get interesting.

338

So, we're just gonna play right
into the perp's hands now?

Why's that?

Well, I mean, she
looks so hardcore,

and she acts that way when
she's working a case,

356
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:42,083
so I just figured she'd
be more like Deana.

It's funny, she wasn't

She was so kind when
we partnered up.

363
00:13:57,416 --> 00:14:00,041
Right away, she asked if
I needed a place to live

364
00:14:00,125 --> 00:14:01,916
and offered her own.

365

But I learned all
those things from her.

If people in school had known
she was that type of person,

369

I'm sure she would've
gotten invited to her prom.

Oh. I didn't mean she wasn't
invited, she just didn't go.

No, overdose.

[MAXINE]
Let the hostage go, right now!

487
00:19:01,083 --> 00:19:03,333
[YURI] Once upon a time,
there was a girl

488
00:19:03,416 --> 00:19:06,583
who wanted to go to prom
more than anything else.

489
00:19:06,666 --> 00:19:09,208
She was an ordinary
girl, a little shy,

490
00:19:09,291 --> 00:19:11,833
and a strong affinity
for anything cute.

491
00:19:11,916 --> 00:19:15,166
She had a best friend, a nice
boy who went to her school.

492
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:16,875
His name was Connor.

493
00:19:16,958 --> 00:19:19,166
The two seemed like
complete opposites,

494
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:22,625
but they got along quite
well, nonetheless.

495
00:19:22,708 --> 00:19:25,416
Please save me!
I don't want to die!

496
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,333
I said let go of the hostage!

497
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:30,041
[YURI] The girl was sure Connor
would ask her to the prom,

498
00:19:30,125 --> 00:19:32,083
and since it was what she
wanted most in the world,

499
00:19:32,166 --> 00:19:34,291
she thought about it constantly.

500
00:19:34,375 --> 00:19:35,791
But before the big
night arrived,

501
00:19:35,875 --> 00:19:37,958
Connor made a confession
to the girl.

502
00:19:38,041 --> 00:19:39,625
Something that she never
could have imagined

503
00:19:39,708 --> 00:19:41,083
before that moment.

504
00:19:41,166 --> 00:19:44,625
It was a secret that he could
entrust to no one else.

505
00:19:47,625 --> 00:19:49,791
The girl accepted this
new version of Connor

506
00:19:49,875 --> 00:19:51,750
without question.

507
00:19:51,833 --> 00:19:53,833
But the other students
weren't as open-minded,

508
00:19:53,916 --> 00:19:55,916
and they rejected him.

509
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,916
The two of them weren't even
allowed to enter the ballroom.

510
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,958
After that fateful night,
Connor turned to drugs

511
00:20:01,041 --> 00:20:03,500
and left town without a
word, never to return,

512
00:20:03,583 --> 00:20:05,625
leaving the girl without
her best friend.

513
00:20:05,708 --> 00:20:06,833
And as for the girl...

their prom, or...?
