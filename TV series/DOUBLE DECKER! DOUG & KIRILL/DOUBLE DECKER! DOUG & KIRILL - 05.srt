That's enough.

You mean the High-sodium,

Don't be rude. I cooked
those french fries myself!

[KIRILL]
Ah, right.

So, half-canned,
half-frozen, what a treat.

00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:21,958
[DERICK] Man, it was
downright hilarious, huh?

40
00:03:22,041 --> 00:03:23,166
The zany way we met?

Aw, come on, man,
don't embarrass me!

42

Well, I still can't
quite believe

that you were Old Man Dan's--

[NARRATOR] Look, folks,
Derick and Kirill's meeting

45

was a stupid cliché, so
we're skippin' right over it!

The food's so tasty, you can't
help but smile, am I right?

Keep dreaming.

48
00:03:37,833 --> 00:03:39,791
It just brought back
a memory of my sister.

49
00:03:39,875 --> 00:03:41,291
Oh. Your sister.

50

The one who's been
missin' a while?

[KIRILL]
Yeah, that's her.

52
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:46,666
We went to this
fair together once.

53
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:47,916
But we were kinda poor,

54
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,208
so we didn't have enough
money to buy anything.

55
00:03:50,291 --> 00:03:53,625
They must have felt
sorry for us, I guess.

56
00:03:53,708 --> 00:03:55,208
This worker gave us some fries.

Said he was just
gonna throw 'em out.

I can't believe Doug.
He's such a jerk, you know?

of a story, here!

it kill him to drop by

63
00:04:12,333 --> 00:04:13,250
A cat?

64
00:04:13,333 --> 00:04:14,333
[DERICK]
Doug?!

65
00:04:14,416 --> 00:04:16,666
Sorry, kid, but lunch
time's over now.

66
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:18,083
[KIRILL]
Huh? A new case?

67
00:04:18,166 --> 00:04:20,041
You'll see, let's go.

68
00:04:23,541 --> 00:04:26,375
Hey, uh, Doug? It's that guy.

69
00:04:26,458 --> 00:04:28,125
His name's Zabel Franken.

70
00:04:28,208 --> 00:04:31,833
Also known as "Z." He's an
old Esperanza leader.

71
00:04:31,916 --> 00:04:34,666
The one whose release
Cyrus demanded.

72
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:36,166
You knew. I'm impressed.

73
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:38,000
Here's the word
on this Zabel guy.

74
00:04:38,083 --> 00:04:40,750
He got into a public fight with
a dealer and started shooting.

75
00:04:40,833 --> 00:04:43,541
He murdered five people,
including a three-year-old kid.

76
00:04:43,625 --> 00:04:45,125
They sentenced him to death.

77
00:04:45,208 --> 00:04:47,750
The execution date was set
for this evening. But...

78
00:04:47,833 --> 00:04:48,875
But now he's talking.

79
00:04:48,958 --> 00:04:51,000
He suddenly has new
testimony to give.

80
00:04:51,083 --> 00:04:53,166
He's just stalling
'cause he's afraid to die.

81
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:55,291
The city charter of
Lisvalletta clearly outlines

82
00:04:55,375 --> 00:04:57,625
prisoner rights in
articles 22 and 25,

83
00:04:57,708 --> 00:04:59,541
and he does have the right
to present new evidence.

84
00:04:59,625 --> 00:05:01,125
Moron.

85
00:05:01,208 --> 00:05:03,208
You fill your head with a bunch
of boring data all the time--

86
00:05:03,291 --> 00:05:04,708
that's why you're
completely useless.

87
00:05:04,791 --> 00:05:07,500
It's our job to uphold the law--
why wouldn't I study it?

88
00:05:07,583 --> 00:05:09,916
Screw that law, this
guy murdered a toddler.

discrimination, sir.

[TRAVIS]
But why? You're angels, dammit!

97
00:05:24,916 --> 00:05:26,458
Calling women "angels"
in the workplace

98
00:05:26,541 --> 00:05:28,333
hasn't been okay
for a few decades.

99
00:05:28,416 --> 00:05:30,125
Well, can Buzz Cut
become an angel?

100
00:05:30,208 --> 00:05:32,166
To be perfectly frank,
I'd rather he didn't.

For real?

Zabel specifically wants me
to hear his new testimony.

That's what's going on, right?

00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,458
Correct, as usual.

[DOUG] Dammit. Does it
really have to be me, though?

109
00:05:49,041 --> 00:05:49,833
It does, in fact.

110
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:51,583

Come on, Travis.

the afternoon off.

Why, you got something
important going on?

114
00:05:56,666 --> 00:05:59,583
I gotta do laundry. I'm all
out of clean underwear.

115
00:05:59,666 --> 00:06:01,666
Why would you tell us that?

116
00:06:03,666 --> 00:06:05,500
[KIRILL]
Huh? Huh...?

Hold on, you're the one
who apprehended Zabel?

That's right.

120

[KIRILL] And in your first year
at SEVEN-O on top of that?

You caught a real-life baddie!

124
00:06:17,875 --> 00:06:21,083
[DOUG] I brought him in on
a petty, small-time charge.

125
00:06:21,166 --> 00:06:24,875
After that, he just started
confessing to the rest.

126
00:06:24,958 --> 00:06:26,791
Then, why would he
specifically ask for you

127
00:06:26,875 --> 00:06:28,500
to hear his confession?

128

No idea.

Yeah, all 26 leaders
of Esperanza

to a letter in the

Interesting. I wonder why
nobody ever told me that.

Why would we?

It wouldn't do a damn bit

leader goes by "A,"

159
00:07:28,541 --> 00:07:30,041
and status descends from there.

160
00:07:30,125 --> 00:07:32,875
Zabel's position would be last?

161
00:07:32,958 --> 00:07:34,166
[KIRILL]
What are you saying?

162
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:36,416
Did you really murder
the boss of Esperanza?

163
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:37,916
[ZABEL]
Yes.

164
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,041
I was working for B, and I
wanted him to become the leader.

165
00:07:40,125 --> 00:07:42,125
So, I decided to kill A myself.

166
00:07:42,208 --> 00:07:44,041
But, I've regretted
it ever since.

167
00:07:44,125 --> 00:07:46,250
Is that really the best
crap you could dream up?

168
00:07:46,333 --> 00:07:47,666
I'm telling the truth!

169
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:49,125
I did it to help B advance!

170
00:07:49,208 --> 00:07:51,416
The Bamboo Man? That's B?

171
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:52,833
[KIRILL gasps]
Wait, you mean--?

172
00:07:52,916 --> 00:07:55,791
I don't know about that!
B is just B!

173
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:57,458
Keep talking.

174
00:07:57,541 --> 00:07:58,666
[ZABEL]
B said to me,

175
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:01,041
"Sorry to make you do
all the dirty work.

176
00:08:01,125 --> 00:08:03,041
But I promise that if
you go down for this,

177
00:08:03,125 --> 00:08:05,000
or anything else you
do in service of me,

178
00:08:05,083 --> 00:08:07,041
take my word, I'll get you out.

179
00:08:07,125 --> 00:08:08,791
You can count on that."

180
00:08:08,875 --> 00:08:12,125
That's why I waited until
today to confess what I did.

181
00:08:12,208 --> 00:08:14,416
Because he broke his promise
to set you free, huh?

182
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,125
I can't trust anyone now!

183
00:08:16,208 --> 00:08:17,500
Please! I'll tell
you everything,

184
00:08:17,583 --> 00:08:19,541
just don't give me the chair!

185
00:08:19,625 --> 00:08:21,000
I said stay seated!

186
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:23,166
[KIRILL] Don't you know how
to use your words, moron?

187
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:25,333
Ah, shut up, you
wimpy-ass pansy boy.

188
00:08:25,416 --> 00:08:26,666
--Excuse me?
--Hey.

189
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:28,416
[PRISON GUARD 5A]
Ricky!

190
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,166
[ZABEL]
I get it.

191
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:31,500
No matter what I tell you,

192
00:08:31,583 --> 00:08:33,791
you'll never believe me
after what I've done.

193
00:08:33,875 --> 00:08:35,583
But, still. It's true.

194
00:08:35,666 --> 00:08:37,125
You do understand.

195
00:08:37,208 --> 00:08:38,625
Even if we wanted
to believe you,

196
00:08:38,708 --> 00:08:42,166
words aren't enough
to convince us now.

197
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:45,416
He's buried under the
Mermaid Statue in Portus Park.

198
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:48,583
For what it's worth,
A was always good to me.

199
00:08:48,666 --> 00:08:50,625
I wanted to give him
a final resting place

200
00:08:50,708 --> 00:08:52,791
that had a pretty view,
at the very least.

201
00:08:52,875 --> 00:08:54,291
--Let's go.
--[KIRILL] Oh. Right.

202
00:08:54,375 --> 00:08:56,750
Is this really how you pigs
do business these days?

203
00:08:56,833 --> 00:08:57,791
Stop that!

204
00:08:57,875 --> 00:08:59,250
[RICKY]
What's the point of saving

205
00:08:59,333 --> 00:09:00,958
a mass murderer's worthless
life for shit information

206
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:02,208
that'll probably
amount to nothing?

207
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:04,250
When's he scheduled
to be executed?

208
00:09:04,333 --> 00:09:05,083
[RICKY]
Hm?

209
00:09:05,166 --> 00:09:06,750
Eighteen hundred on the dot.

210
00:09:06,833 --> 00:09:08,916
I'll have a solid answer
for you by then.

211
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,500
Good day.

212
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:11,958
[ZABEL]
Thank you, thank you, thank you,

213
00:09:12,041 --> 00:09:13,666
thank you, thank you, thank
you, thank you, thank you!

Thank you, thank you,
thank you, thank you,

thank you, thank you,
thank you, thank you...

216
00:09:17,583 --> 00:09:20,250
[NARRATOR] And thus, a new
investigation baby was born!

217
00:09:20,333 --> 00:09:22,000
Since the info
couldn't be verified,

218
00:09:22,083 --> 00:09:24,291
the guys upstairs wouldn't
provide any man-power,

219
00:09:24,375 --> 00:09:25,208
which means--!

220
00:09:25,291 --> 00:09:26,500
[DEANA]
F(bleep) dirt!

221
00:09:26,583 --> 00:09:28,458
[NARRATOR] The usual
SEVEN-O six went to work!

222
00:09:28,541 --> 00:09:31,083
With just four hours to go,
they'd dug up nothing but dirt.

223
00:09:31,166 --> 00:09:33,625
And not the figurative
kind, either.

224
00:09:35,166 --> 00:09:36,875
Maybe he was lying, after all.

225
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:37,708
Bummer.

226
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:39,000
It's perfect, too.

227
00:09:39,083 --> 00:09:39,916
[KIRILL]
Huh?

228
00:09:41,208 --> 00:09:43,166
The perfect day to
hang-dry undies.

229
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:45,750
A man's life is on the
line, not your skivvies.

230
00:09:45,833 --> 00:09:47,583
[DOUG] If you don't learn
how to stay detached

231
00:09:47,666 --> 00:09:49,875
from your cases, you'll
get swallowed up, fast.

232
00:09:49,958 --> 00:09:52,375
That may be true,
but I don't know how.

233
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:53,875
You guys! Come, quickly!

234
00:09:53,958 --> 00:09:55,166
Huh?

235
00:09:56,875 --> 00:09:58,291
So, he was telling the truth.

236
00:09:58,375 --> 00:09:59,500
Not so fast.

237
00:09:59,583 --> 00:10:01,875
We don't know if this
foot belonged to A.

238
00:10:03,916 --> 00:10:05,708
[DOUG]
Agapetus Kroyd.

239
00:10:07,041 --> 00:10:09,666
[KIRILL]
Hey, why'd you bolt like that?

240
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:10,541
[KIRILL gasps]

241
00:10:10,625 --> 00:10:12,166
"Agapetus Kroyd.

242
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:14,000
Rumored to be a
leader of Esperanza,

243
00:10:14,083 --> 00:10:16,291
though nothing was ever found
to substantiate this claim.

244
00:10:16,375 --> 00:10:17,833
Ten years back, he was arrested

245
00:10:17,916 --> 00:10:19,625
for interfering with
an investigation.

246
00:10:19,708 --> 00:10:22,000
After release, he vanished
without a trace.

247
00:10:22,083 --> 00:10:23,458
During the arrest,

248
00:10:23,541 --> 00:10:25,416
he sustained a comminuted
fracture to his right ankle.

249
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:28,000
[DOUG] He insisted on a special
metal plate to set the bone,

250
00:10:28,083 --> 00:10:29,875
then he billed us an
astronomical amount

251
00:10:29,958 --> 00:10:31,875
for the surgery.

252
00:10:31,958 --> 00:10:33,708
Zabel killed A, no doubt.

253
00:10:33,791 --> 00:10:34,750
[KIRILL gasps]

254
00:10:49,541 --> 00:10:52,125
[ZABEL] See? I told you,
I wasn't lying.

255
00:10:52,208 --> 00:10:54,291
[KIRILL] All we found was a
dismembered right foot, though.

256
00:10:54,375 --> 00:10:55,583
Where's the rest of the body?

257
00:10:55,666 --> 00:10:57,208
Well, I'll tell you everything.

258
00:10:57,291 --> 00:10:59,500
Where I buried him,
and all about Esperanza.

259
00:10:59,583 --> 00:11:00,958
You know what I want.

260
00:11:01,041 --> 00:11:02,250
Where's your guarantee?

261
00:11:02,333 --> 00:11:03,250
Huh?

262
00:11:03,333 --> 00:11:04,291
[ZABEL]
I won't say anything more

263
00:11:04,375 --> 00:11:05,541
unless you make it official.

264
00:11:05,625 --> 00:11:07,416
Wait. Make what official?

265
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,500
[ZABEL] An official plea
bargain from the court.

266
00:11:09,583 --> 00:11:10,750
[gasps]

267
00:11:10,833 --> 00:11:11,958
[ZABEL] I'll tell you
what you want to know,

268
00:11:12,041 --> 00:11:14,458
but only if you pledge
to grant me my life.

269
00:11:14,541 --> 00:11:17,208
[DOUG] Is that why you
asked for me by name?

270
00:11:17,291 --> 00:11:19,166
SEVEN-O has that ability.

271
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:23,250
We can secure plea bargains for
all cases involving Anthem.

272
00:11:23,333 --> 00:11:25,041
Doug, I'm very sorry.

273
00:11:25,125 --> 00:11:27,000
But you can understand
why I have trouble

274
00:11:27,083 --> 00:11:30,416
taking anyone at
their word, right?

275
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:32,250
Yeah. I can understand that.

00:11:32,333 --> 00:11:34,041
[ZABEL]
Doug, wait!

277
00:11:34,125 --> 00:11:35,416
I saved these for you.

Chocolate tart? [groans]

279
00:11:37,208 --> 00:11:39,250
Sorry. My hand
must have slipped.

[ZABEL]
M-M-- My... tarts...

281
00:11:45,625 --> 00:11:47,166
[DOUG]
The deal's been made.

282
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:48,750
If all conditions are met,

283
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:51,041
they'll downgrade the
sentence to life in prison.

284
00:11:51,125 --> 00:11:52,500
[KIRILL]
What conditions?

285
00:11:52,583 --> 00:11:55,125
He has to tell us everything
he knows about Esperanza.

286
00:11:55,208 --> 00:11:57,250
Also, we have to
locate the body,

287
00:11:57,333 --> 00:11:59,541
before the scheduled
time of execution.

288
00:11:59,625 --> 00:12:01,125
[KIRILL] That's an hour
and a half from now!

289
00:12:01,208 --> 00:12:03,041
How are we supposed to
find it in that little time?

290
00:12:03,125 --> 00:12:05,083
We'll just do our
jobs, like always.

291
00:12:05,166 --> 00:12:06,583
That's all we can do.

292
00:12:06,666 --> 00:12:09,125
But what if they execute Zabel
before we find anything?!

293
00:12:09,208 --> 00:12:12,375
[DOUG] Be careful, don't
get attached to the case.

294
00:12:12,458 --> 00:12:14,750
Admit it: You're just
as attached as I am.

295
00:12:14,833 --> 00:12:16,416
[DOUG]
Hm?

296
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:19,125
[KIRILL] You're the one who put
together the Esperanza file.

297
00:12:19,208 --> 00:12:21,083
Did you think I missed that?

298
00:12:21,166 --> 00:12:23,041
Don't underestimate
your partner!

299
00:12:23,125 --> 00:12:25,291
I'd recognize your chicken
scratch anywhere!

300
00:12:25,375 --> 00:12:28,083
Every page was filled with
your scribbled notes.

301
00:12:28,166 --> 00:12:30,916
So, what happened to make you
so obsessed with Esperanza?!

302
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,333
[DOUG]
Nothing.

303
00:12:32,416 --> 00:12:35,791
I'm just a more thorough
note-taker than one would think.

304
00:12:35,875 --> 00:12:37,875
Right. Where's it buried, then?

305
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:40,500
[ZABEL] The elementary school
near the Mermaid Statue.

306
00:12:40,583 --> 00:12:41,583
It's abandoned now.

307
00:12:41,666 --> 00:12:43,208
Where exactly in the school?

308
00:12:43,291 --> 00:12:45,458
Ah, why not let me
take you to the site?

309
00:12:45,541 --> 00:12:48,041
I can't describe it, but I could
lead you there in no time.

310
00:12:48,125 --> 00:12:49,458
Sorry, no dice.

311
00:12:49,541 --> 00:12:51,291
There's no way they're
letting you out of this place.

312
00:12:51,375 --> 00:12:52,708
But I'm running out of time!

313
00:12:52,791 --> 00:12:54,666
If they don't find the body,

[BOTH gasp]

472
00:19:54,208 --> 00:19:55,708
Damn it!

473
00:19:59,708 --> 00:20:01,875
[TRAVIS] Zabel attacked
his guards mid-transport

474
00:20:01,958 --> 00:20:03,375
and fled the scene.

475
00:20:03,458 --> 00:20:06,208
Unfortunately, I'm afraid we
don't have a 20 on him now.

476
00:20:06,291 --> 00:20:08,875
But thanks to the information
Doug secured for us,

477
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:11,416
we were able to raid the hideout
and arrest some leaders.

478
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:13,416
P, Q, and T, in fact.

479
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,291
We don't know his
exact time of death,

480
00:20:15,375 --> 00:20:17,958
but the body at the school
was indeed that of A.

481
00:20:18,041 --> 00:20:19,416
So that makes up for the loss--

482
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:22,291
It's not, enough, though, right?

483
00:20:22,375 --> 00:20:24,333
[DOUG exhales]

484
00:20:24,416 --> 00:20:27,000
[TRAVIS]
Get some rest. That's an order.

485
00:20:31,041 --> 00:20:32,458
[DERICK]
It's a good night for it.

486
00:20:32,541 --> 00:20:34,083
To let loose and party!

487
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:35,291
[KIRILL]
I'm not in the mood.

488
00:20:35,375 --> 00:20:37,041
I deserve canned beans.

489
00:20:37,125 --> 00:20:38,416
[door opens]

490
00:20:41,083 --> 00:20:42,291
[DOUG]
Here's my apology.

491
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:46,250
Why would you need
to apologize to me?

492
00:20:46,333 --> 00:20:49,416
My first partner passed
away. Still haunts me.

493
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:50,750
[gasps]

494
00:20:50,833 --> 00:20:53,750
It was on a prior
Esperanza case.

495
00:20:53,833 --> 00:20:58,291
So, the thing about the notes,
it's kind of a compulsion now.

496
00:20:58,375 --> 00:21:01,541
I see...

497
00:21:01,625 --> 00:21:03,125
I'll do that from now on, too.

498
00:21:03,208 --> 00:21:04,375
Huh?

499
00:21:04,458 --> 00:21:06,250
Let's do whatever we can
to solve this damn case,

500
00:21:06,333 --> 00:21:07,458
like taking obsessive notes!

501
00:21:07,541 --> 00:21:09,958
We'll get Bamboo Man and Zabel!

502
00:21:11,625 --> 00:21:13,625
Huh? Where you goin'?

503
00:21:13,708 --> 00:21:15,541
I apologized.

504
00:21:18,583 --> 00:21:21,208
One drink? That's classic Doug.

505
00:23:07,333 --> 00:23:08,708
[RICKY groaning]

506
00:23:08,791 --> 00:23:12,833
[BAMBOO MAN] Are you having
a nice time, number 813?

507
00:23:12,916 --> 00:23:14,791
[RICKY]
Uh! This wasn't the deal!

508
00:23:14,875 --> 00:23:16,583
I helped you, just
like I said I would!

509
00:23:16,666 --> 00:23:19,916
[ZABEL] Yeah, you were such a
big help, weren't you, Ricky?

510
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,666
I was able to get ahold of B,

511
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:23,750
and all because you
prepared this fun,

512
00:23:23,833 --> 00:23:25,750
little activity for me.

513
00:23:25,833 --> 00:23:27,666
Putting the location of A's body

514
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:29,125
in the crossword
puzzle solutions

515
00:23:29,208 --> 00:23:31,250
was a veritable
stroke of genius.

516
00:23:31,333 --> 00:23:33,458
That thrilling treasure
hunt B led us on

517
00:23:33,541 --> 00:23:35,250
was a whole lot of fun.

518
00:23:35,333 --> 00:23:37,750
[BAMBOO MAN]
And that light, narrow mark?

519
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:39,166
A bamboo leaf.

520
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:41,000
[ZABEL]
Ah-ha. Excellent touch.

521
00:23:41,083 --> 00:23:42,208
Then why are you treati--?

522
00:23:42,291 --> 00:23:43,708
[groaning]

523
00:23:43,791 --> 00:23:45,458
You made an unforgivable error

524
00:23:45,541 --> 00:23:48,083
at a crucial moment
in the operation.

525
00:23:51,541 --> 00:23:53,958
I absolutely detest when
people waste food

526
00:23:54,041 --> 00:23:56,083
for no apparent reason.

527
00:23:59,375 --> 00:24:01,875
[ZABEL]
Zabel Franken is a dead man now.

528
00:24:01,958 --> 00:24:05,750
So, it's time for us
to get started... B.

529
00:24:05,833 --> 00:24:07,875
Yes. Boss.

530
00:24:11,583 --> 00:24:13,833
[NARRATOR] Doug and Kirill
developed a tighter bond, huh?

531
00:24:13,916 --> 00:24:15,458
The story's about to
reach its climax,

532
00:24:15,541 --> 00:24:17,791
but then it'll veer off in an
entirely different direction!

533
00:24:17,875 --> 00:24:19,833
Next time, on <i>Double</i>
<i>Decker</i> , episode six:

534
00:24:19,916 --> 00:24:21,083
"Up Close and Personal:

535
00:24:21,166 --> 00:24:22,666
Twenty-four hours with
the Lisvalletta Police!"

536
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:23,875
[MYSTERIOUS MAN 5A]
Listen, officer!

537
00:24:23,958 --> 00:24:26,333
It's not my fault this
dumbass fell for it!
