We've brought photographs.

75
00:04:18,333 --> 00:04:20,958
They're of four people who've
died under strange circumstances

76
00:04:21,041 --> 00:04:24,166
in the past few months.

77
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:27,000
Our investigation revealed that
all four of the deceased men

78
00:04:27,083 --> 00:04:29,833
had a couple of things
in common. First of all,

79
00:04:29,916 --> 00:04:32,791
every single one of them
was a confirmed Anthem user.

80
00:04:32,875 --> 00:04:34,166
And the other commonality...

81
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:35,791
...is that they were
all former patients

82
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:37,583
of this hospital, right?

83
00:04:37,666 --> 00:04:39,041
Wow.

84
00:04:39,125 --> 00:04:41,291
Here you are,
running this entire joint,

85
00:04:41,375 --> 00:04:42,958
yet you've still got
enough time to learn

86
00:04:43,041 --> 00:04:44,541
the names and faces of
all the patients?

87
00:04:44,625 --> 00:04:47,541
You're speaking to the leading
authority in end-of-life care.

This doctor... He does
everything he can--

89
00:04:51,083 --> 00:04:54,250
Each of these men was informed
they didn't have long to live.

90
00:04:54,333 --> 00:04:56,416
We were developing a care
plan for all of them.

91
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,333
But, before anything
was finalized,

92
00:04:58,416 --> 00:05:00,125
they forced their way
out of the hospital.

93
00:05:00,208 --> 00:05:03,333
I can understand why they'd
turn to Anthem as an escape.

94
00:05:03,416 --> 00:05:04,791
They were desperate for relief.

95
00:05:04,875 --> 00:05:07,416
If I didn't know better,
I'd call that an endorsement.

It's a fine line.

100
00:05:12,458 --> 00:05:14,583
It comes down to
how the drug is used.

101
00:05:14,666 --> 00:05:17,416
I wonder... Do you even
understand how Anthem

102
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,708
affects the human body
and its various processes?

with a really weird name I

106
00:05:26,083 --> 00:05:27,458
Anthem works in a similar way.

107
00:05:27,541 --> 00:05:29,500

U-Uh... Uh...

110
00:05:35,208 --> 00:05:36,541
[KIRILL]
During normal gene editing,


111
00:05:36,625 --> 00:05:38,666
there's always a small chance
that an error can occur.


112
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:41,166
A mutation, which can
awaken dormant genes.


113
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:44,041
What we refer to as "Overdrive,"
is really just that.

114
00:05:44,125 --> 00:05:46,958
It occurs as a result of
these errors in the code.

115
00:05:47,041 --> 00:05:49,041
I would imagine that Anthem
is kind of similar

116
00:05:49,125 --> 00:05:51,166
to a bacteria molecule
in that way,

117
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:55,625
'cause I think bacteria contain
something called a vector.

118
00:05:55,708 --> 00:05:57,208
Yeah, that does sound right.

119
00:05:57,291 --> 00:06:00,250
Vectors copy genetic material
and deliver it to other cells.

120
00:06:00,333 --> 00:06:01,500
Right!

121
00:06:01,583 --> 00:06:03,375
They really just behave
as carriers in that way.

122
00:06:03,458 --> 00:06:06,583
It's rare, but this process
can cause the genes to mutate.

123
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:10,958
And the mutations can affect
the physical body, as well.

124
00:06:11,041 --> 00:06:12,333
Am I in the ballpark?

at this hospital who--

00:15:22,958 --> 00:15:24,750
Correction, a former patient.

Pardon me, Doctor.

Yes, what is it?

379
00:15:30,791 --> 00:15:32,875
We found Anthem in
the patient's blood.

Do you have any idea how
that might have happened?

He fled the scene in spite
of some nasty wounds,

not to mention his illness.

It seems clear that his body

00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,125
physical change, yet our systems
didn't detect Overdrive.

I'm just wondering what you
make of that, Doctor.

00:15:47,791 --> 00:15:50,458
There's not enough information
to make anything of it.

Although... When you're at
death's door and you feel like

388
00:15:53,375 --> 00:15:56,291
a shell of your former self,
don't you think it's normal

00:19:17,916 --> 00:19:21,916
Save me. I don't want to die.

473
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,666
I'm giving my patients hope
in the face of imminent doom!

474
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:26,958
[KIRILL] Don't you dare talk
about hope! Shut your mouth!

475
00:19:27,041 --> 00:19:28,541
Enough, let him go.

476
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:30,875
Jeffery. Do you want to live?

477
00:19:30,958 --> 00:19:31,750
[gasps]

478
00:19:31,833 --> 00:19:34,208
Yes? Then you have to help me!

479
00:19:34,291 --> 00:19:36,250
Use the Anthem, now!

480
00:19:36,333 --> 00:19:39,416
If you take the drug, you'll
have the strength of a giant!

481
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:41,625
And the vitality to
beat your illness!

482
00:19:41,708 --> 00:19:42,708
[KIRILL]
You liar!

483
00:19:42,791 --> 00:19:44,541
[DOCTOR HOPE]
Come, let's run away.

484
00:19:44,625 --> 00:19:47,958
I'm the only person in the
world who can keep you alive.

485
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:51,666
[DOCTOR HOPE] Don't you
want to see him grow up?

486
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:55,250
To see your son get married?
Meet your future grandkids?

487
00:19:57,041 --> 00:19:58,416
I do.

488
00:19:58,500 --> 00:19:59,458
Dad, stop it.

489
00:19:59,541 --> 00:20:00,291
Use it!

490
00:20:00,375 --> 00:20:01,916
No! Don't!

491
00:20:16,125 --> 00:20:17,583
[yells]

492
00:20:17,666 --> 00:20:18,916
[DOCTOR HOPE gasps]

493
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,583
I refuse.

494
00:20:20,666 --> 00:20:23,625
You'll never make me a monster.

495
00:20:23,708 --> 00:20:26,875
I'd rather die as
my son's father.

496
00:20:36,625 --> 00:20:37,791
[DOUG]
Hello, Jeffrey.

497
00:20:37,875 --> 00:20:38,625
How are you doing?

498
00:20:38,708 --> 00:20:40,416
Much better, thanks.

499
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,666
Especially now that I'm
in this fancy new room.

500
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:45,708
Listen, the investigators will
be asking you some questions.

501
00:20:45,791 --> 00:20:48,500
But, all told, it shouldn't
take more than an hour.

502
00:20:48,583 --> 00:20:49,583
Yes, of course.

503
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:52,750
There's something else.

504
00:20:52,833 --> 00:20:55,375
Gus planned a special
surprise for you.

505
00:20:57,291 --> 00:20:58,250
What's all this?

506
00:20:58,333 --> 00:20:59,833
You wanted to see
me get married.

507
00:20:59,916 --> 00:21:03,083
So, I am. Well, not really,
but I think you get it.

508
00:21:03,166 --> 00:21:04,750
You look gorgeous.

509
00:21:04,833 --> 00:21:07,583
Yes. I think so, too.

510
00:21:07,666 --> 00:21:09,416
Detective.

511
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:11,833
I promise to do my best, Dad.

512
00:21:11,916 --> 00:21:15,458
I'm gonna study hard,
and I won't become a thug!

513
00:21:15,541 --> 00:21:17,333
Someday I'll marry for real.

514
00:21:17,416 --> 00:21:20,041
Maybe a pretty girl,
or an ugly one, or heck,

515
00:21:20,125 --> 00:21:22,041
even a guy, like this loser.

516
00:21:22,125 --> 00:21:24,583
Hey, you shouldn't call
your bride a loser!

517
00:21:24,666 --> 00:21:27,708
And who knows? Maybe I
won't even get married at all.

518
00:21:27,791 --> 00:21:30,666
But... If I do,
I want to have a kid.

519
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:33,833
So, I can be an amazing
father, like you've been.

520
00:21:33,916 --> 00:21:36,583
I'll live like you, for my kid.

521
00:21:36,666 --> 00:21:39,291
But I know I'll be okay
no matter what happens!

522
00:21:39,375 --> 00:21:43,958
So, please, don't just hang on
'cause you're worried about me.

523
00:21:44,041 --> 00:21:46,916
I'm fine, and I'm glad
you're still here--

524
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,333
[GUS, JEFFREY crying]

525
00:21:57,041 --> 00:21:58,375
[KAY]
Interesting.

526
00:21:58,458 --> 00:22:01,125
So, then, Gus is going to live
with your landlady now?

527
00:22:01,208 --> 00:22:02,958
Yeah, but it's just temporary.

528
00:22:03,041 --> 00:22:05,125
In the meantime, they'll
talk to a social worker,

529
00:22:05,208 --> 00:22:07,250
and try to figure out
what comes next.

530
00:22:07,333 --> 00:22:09,333
Are you gonna handle
all that paperwork?

531
00:22:09,416 --> 00:22:10,458
Yeah.

532
00:22:10,541 --> 00:22:12,416
They asked if I wanted
to take him in,

533
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:14,625
but I don't think I'm ready
for that kind of thing.

534
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:16,500
Uh! Here, lemme help you.

535
00:22:16,583 --> 00:22:17,958
Thanks, Kirill.

536
00:22:19,583 --> 00:22:22,083
When your shift is over, I'll
walk you home, just to be safe.

537
00:22:22,166 --> 00:22:24,125
And I'll walk you down
the aisle at your wedding!

538
00:22:24,208 --> 00:22:27,416
Well, just because I
wear women's clothes...

539
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:29,958
Thanks... Little Brother.

540
00:22:30,041 --> 00:22:31,791
[COOPER]
Constable Kirill Vrubel, is it?

541
00:22:31,875 --> 00:22:33,500
[KIRILL, MILLA gasp]

542
00:22:33,583 --> 00:22:37,208
They told me down at the station
that I might find you here.

543
00:22:37,291 --> 00:22:40,916
So... Have any interest
in joining the military?

544
00:24:11,291 --> 00:24:12,833
[NARRATOR] Kirill doesn't know
how to respond

545
00:24:12,916 --> 00:24:14,166
to this sudden invitation!

546
00:24:14,250 --> 00:24:16,125
As the wheels of fate
begin turning faster,

547
00:24:16,208 --> 00:24:18,125
the ball of destiny
starts rolling, too!

548
00:24:18,208 --> 00:24:19,750
Life's a roller coaster,
mother [bleep],

549
00:24:19,833 --> 00:24:21,375
so Kirill better
hold on to his butt!

550
00:24:21,458 --> 00:24:23,500
Next time, on <i>Double Decker</i> :
Episode Eleven!

551
00:24:23,583 --> 00:24:26,208
"SEVEN-O Dies Twice!"
Wait, they can't die!
