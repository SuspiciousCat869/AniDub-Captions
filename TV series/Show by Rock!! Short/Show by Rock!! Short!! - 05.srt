[TOKIKO]
It's Tokiko's R-R-R-Room!

2
00:00:28,708 --> 00:00:31,875
Hello there, it's me,
Tokiko Shirosugawa.

3
00:00:31,958 --> 00:00:33,666
Today, our lovely
guests will be making

4
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:35,125
their third appearance
on the show,

5
00:00:35,208 --> 00:00:36,666
and I couldn't be happier.

6
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:38,958
Still the biggest draw in Midi
City's entertainment world,

7
00:00:39,041 --> 00:00:42,083
welcome the boys of Trichronika!

8
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:46,041
[SHUZO]
Hi!

9
00:00:47,041 --> 00:00:48,916
[screams]

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,916
Goodness, it's been far
too long since last we met!

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,875
I know. It feels
like an eternity!

12
00:00:53,958 --> 00:00:55,958
I thought maybe you'd
forgotten about me!

13
00:00:56,041 --> 00:00:59,791
'Course not. I could never
forget my precious Tokiko.

14
00:00:59,875 --> 00:01:02,916
As if anyone else could, either.

15
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,666
But really, we're just so
thrilled to be back on the show!

16
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:08,416
It's another chance to shine!

17
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:11,333
Twins! C'mon, don't
be shy. Say hello!

18
00:01:11,416 --> 00:01:12,583
[KAI, RIKU]
Hi!

19
00:01:12,666 --> 00:01:15,291
I'm Kai, the drummer!
Thanks for having me!

20
00:01:15,375 --> 00:01:18,083
I'm the bassist, Riku!
It's great to be here!

21
00:01:18,166 --> 00:01:20,583
Cut to commercial, please.

22
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:27,958
The melon flavor is my
favorite! What's yours, Kai?

23
00:01:28,041 --> 00:01:30,041
Well, I like the
grape one the best!

24
00:01:30,125 --> 00:01:32,875
How 'bout you, Shuzo?

25
00:01:32,958 --> 00:01:34,083
[chuckles]

26
00:01:34,166 --> 00:01:36,833
My favorite: Rainbow! Hooray!

27
00:01:36,916 --> 00:01:38,083
--[KAI] Ah!
--[RIKU] Wow!

28
00:01:38,166 --> 00:01:40,166
[ALL]
Dream Galaxy Rainbow Pop!

29
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:44,208
To get another box,
just find a shining star!

30
00:01:44,291 --> 00:01:47,125
[TOKIKO] Now, I'm certain
they need no introduction,

31
00:01:47,208 --> 00:01:49,750
but who cares,
here's Trichronika!

32
00:01:49,833 --> 00:01:51,083
Hey!

33
00:01:51,166 --> 00:01:52,291
[TOKIKO]
How you doin'?

34
00:01:52,375 --> 00:01:54,416
Can you tell us what
you're up to these days?

35
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:55,958
Yes.

36
00:01:56,041 --> 00:01:58,625
So, coming this fall, we're off
on a journey of the cosmos,

37
00:01:58,708 --> 00:02:01,250
called the "Rainbow
Galaxy Tour"!

38
00:02:01,333 --> 00:02:03,333
[KAI] We'll take off
from Sound Planet.

39
00:02:03,416 --> 00:02:06,458
[RIKU] And visit other planets
around Sound Galaxy!

40
00:02:06,541 --> 00:02:08,041
[TOKIKO]
Oh, wonderful!

41
00:02:08,125 --> 00:02:10,166
Wait, does that mean
you won't be performing

42
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:11,875
in Midi City for a while?

43
00:02:11,958 --> 00:02:13,375
I'm sure your fans will be

44
00:02:13,458 --> 00:02:15,333
absolutely devastated
about that.

45
00:02:15,416 --> 00:02:16,291
[SHUZO chuckles]

46
00:02:16,375 --> 00:02:17,875
No need to worry.

47
00:02:17,958 --> 00:02:20,458
We'll be streaming our concerts
to all the folks in Midi City.

48
00:02:20,541 --> 00:02:22,333
So everybody wins!

49
00:02:22,416 --> 00:02:23,791
[TOKIKO]
Be still my shell!

50
00:02:23,875 --> 00:02:26,416
Besides, no matter where I am,

51
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:29,083
you all know my heart
is ever with you.

52
00:02:29,166 --> 00:02:30,000
Yes!

53
00:02:30,083 --> 00:02:32,125
The twins' sparkling stars,

54
00:02:32,208 --> 00:02:34,250
and the gleam of
my morning star,

55
00:02:34,333 --> 00:02:37,000
combined with the raging
adoration from our fans

56
00:02:37,083 --> 00:02:40,708
will create an infinite
rainbow in the whole sky!

57
00:02:40,791 --> 00:02:43,083
I wanna taste the rainbow!

58
00:02:43,166 --> 00:02:46,041
[KAI, RIKU]
Bravo, Shuzo!

59
00:02:46,125 --> 00:02:49,708
Well, everyone, we had
a fabulous time today!

60
00:02:49,791 --> 00:02:51,791
Thank you, and goodbye!
