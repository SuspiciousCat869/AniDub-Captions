It's Tokiko's R-R-R-Room!

00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:31,541
How you doin'?
I'm Tokiko Shirosugawa.

3
00:00:31,625 --> 00:00:34,541
Today, your guests are from
St. Midi Girls' Academy,

4
00:00:34,625 --> 00:00:37,166
which it's been said is the
gateway to guaranteed success.

5
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:39,458
Oh. Hi, you guys!

6
00:00:39,541 --> 00:00:41,333
It's so wonderful to be here!

7
00:00:41,416 --> 00:00:42,750
Yeah, thanks!

[ALL]
And we're Criticrista!

00:00:45,375 --> 00:00:46,500
Come on!

10
00:00:46,583 --> 00:00:48,250
That's like how those
silly comedians

11
00:00:48,333 --> 00:00:52,333
always introduce themselves!

12
00:00:52,416 --> 00:00:54,625
I'm so happy we could
come meet you today!

13
00:00:54,708 --> 00:00:57,291
'Cause everyone knows your
show's the best, Tokiko!

14
00:00:57,375 --> 00:00:59,750
[TOKIKO]
Yes. Well, on to introductions.

15
00:00:59,833 --> 00:01:01,000
Thank you very much.

16
00:01:01,083 --> 00:01:03,166
My name is Holmy, and
I play bass and sing.

17
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:06,416
My name's Tsukino,
and I play the keyboard!

18
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:09,083
Yo, the name is Jacklyn,
and drums are my jam!

19
00:01:09,166 --> 00:01:10,208
Hi!

20
00:01:10,291 --> 00:01:11,291
You know I'm Rosia,

21
00:01:11,375 --> 00:01:13,166
and I'm on lead guitar,
and vocals too!

22
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:14,500
So, hey, all my Big Brothers,

23
00:01:14,583 --> 00:01:17,291
shouldn't you be
recording this right now?

24
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:21,541
Uh, we're excited to have
these girls on the show today,

25
00:01:21,625 --> 00:01:23,125
so let's get to know them.

26
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:25,375
[ROSIA]
Let's get this party started!

27
00:01:25,458 --> 00:01:27,583
[TOKIKO] First question, I
understand each one of you

28
00:01:27,666 --> 00:01:29,875
has a special skill
besides playing music.

29
00:01:29,958 --> 00:01:30,708
Dish!

30
00:01:30,791 --> 00:01:31,583
True!

31
00:01:31,666 --> 00:01:32,666
[TOKIKO]
Let's see, Tsukino,

32
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:34,916
you have perfect pitch,
is that right?

33
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,375
Uh-huh, I totally do!

34
00:01:40,666 --> 00:01:41,625

00:01:44,125 --> 00:01:45,208
[TOKIKO]
Right...

37
00:01:45,291 --> 00:01:46,500
But you know, I'm not so sure

38
00:01:46,583 --> 00:01:48,666
you were quite on
key there, though.

39
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:52,041
Boom, Jacklyn, we hear
you're an elite athlete.

40
00:01:52,125 --> 00:01:53,625
For real, you know it.

41
00:01:53,708 --> 00:01:58,541
I can't really show you here,
though, so I recorded a video!

42
00:01:58,625 --> 00:02:02,041
'Kay, here I go!

43
00:02:02,125 --> 00:02:03,458
Ah-yeah!

44
00:02:03,541 --> 00:02:06,208
[TOKIKO] Um, Rosia, you're
at the top of the class

45
00:02:06,291 --> 00:02:08,041
in "cunning and dance"--
Wait, what is that?

46
00:02:08,125 --> 00:02:10,625
[ROSIA]
You'll see! Can you handle it?

47
00:02:10,708 --> 00:02:14,250
Now, listen up, Big Brothers,
you better not blink.

48
00:02:14,333 --> 00:02:16,083
Promise me, 'kay?

49
00:02:17,333 --> 00:02:19,666
I still don't really
understand what that is,

50
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:22,500
but I'm sure in the middle
schools it's all the rage.

51
00:02:22,583 --> 00:02:25,958
Bang, Holmy, we'd like to hear
about your hellish training.

52
00:02:26,041 --> 00:02:27,041
Of course.

53
00:02:27,125 --> 00:02:28,458
But in order to explain
this accurately,

54
00:02:28,541 --> 00:02:31,458
first I have to tell you about
the eight days of agony.

55
00:02:31,541 --> 00:02:32,791
[TOKIKO]
Ooh.

56
00:02:32,875 --> 00:02:35,458
That sounds like the most
intriguing story so far.

[ROSIA]
Oh, no!

59
00:02:38,875 --> 00:02:40,916
I guess that means we hafta go!

60
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,416
Time sure flies when
you're having fun, right?

61
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:46,416
But I'm sure we'll meet again
at a concert real soon.

Bye-bye!
