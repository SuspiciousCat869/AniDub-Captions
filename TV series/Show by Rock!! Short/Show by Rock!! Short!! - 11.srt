[PLUM]
Chop, chop, lemon drops!

2
00:00:24,333 --> 00:00:27,083
My name is Plum Arisuriver.

3
00:00:27,166 --> 00:00:29,541
I will be giving you a
special lecture today.

4
00:00:29,625 --> 00:00:31,500
It employs the method
acting technique

5
00:00:31,583 --> 00:00:33,250
I learned in exotic New York.

6
00:00:33,333 --> 00:00:36,166
Now, this is no exaggeration
that today's topic

7
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:38,583
is the most important one
we will learn at this school.

8
00:00:38,666 --> 00:00:43,333
It's a critical life skill
every girl needs: Coyness!

9
00:00:43,416 --> 00:00:44,208
Me!

10
00:00:44,291 --> 00:00:45,666
[PLUM]
<i>Oui</i> , Rosia?

11
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:48,166
I, Rosia, will do
my absolute best

12
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:49,958
to remember everything you say!

13
00:00:50,041 --> 00:00:51,625
Three hundred points!

14
00:00:51,708 --> 00:00:55,625
Bravo, bravo, I say! Her
focused gaze! Her tilted neck!

15
00:00:55,708 --> 00:00:59,333
And her salute is just
flawless! <i>Très bon</i> !

16
00:00:59,416 --> 00:01:01,291
<i>Ici</i> , take a closer look.

17
00:01:01,375 --> 00:01:03,208
The palm of her hand
is turned inward!

18
00:01:03,291 --> 00:01:06,000
A salute is how one shows
respect to others.

19
00:01:06,083 --> 00:01:07,708
But hers is a bit different.

20
00:01:07,791 --> 00:01:10,000
It says she won't show all
her cards to the group.

21
00:01:10,083 --> 00:01:11,333
A stubbornness she hides,

22
00:01:11,416 --> 00:01:13,000
while seeming
outwardly friendly.

23
00:01:13,083 --> 00:01:14,333
<i>Perfectamente</i> !

24
00:01:14,416 --> 00:01:16,500
Wow, really? Gosh, thank you!

25
00:01:16,583 --> 00:01:19,083
I didn't really think about it,
though, it just happened.

26
00:01:19,166 --> 00:01:20,875
There! Five hundred points!

27
00:01:20,958 --> 00:01:23,625
The uncalculating innocence she
commits to through the end,

28
00:01:23,708 --> 00:01:26,166
how delightfully coy!

29
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:27,708
A hundred twenty-three!

30
00:01:27,791 --> 00:01:31,583
If you'd said "okay," you
would've earned a mere 32.

31
00:01:31,666 --> 00:01:33,250
Can you explain what you mean?

32
00:01:33,333 --> 00:01:34,416
I got this.

33
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,125
If you'd answered
"okay" with emphasis,

34
00:01:36,208 --> 00:01:38,750
that would have ended the
conversation right there.

35
00:01:38,833 --> 00:01:41,375
But your answer made you
sound unsure of yourself,

36
00:01:41,458 --> 00:01:42,875
so it leaves things open-ended.

37
00:01:42,958 --> 00:01:44,500
Do you know what I mean?

38
00:01:44,583 --> 00:01:45,875
They'd probably think,

39
00:01:45,958 --> 00:01:48,208
"Oh, I wonder if she understood.
Is she all right?"

40
00:01:48,291 --> 00:01:50,208
When that happens,
it means you've directed

41
00:01:50,291 --> 00:01:52,000
all their attention
straight to you.

42
00:01:52,083 --> 00:01:53,458
[JACKLYN]
Ohh.

43
00:01:53,541 --> 00:01:54,875
[ROSIA]
That's it, Jacklyn!

44
00:01:54,958 --> 00:01:56,375
[JACKLYN]
Huh?

45
00:01:56,458 --> 00:01:58,500
Just now, you covered your
mouth in surprise, didn't you?

46
00:01:58,583 --> 00:02:00,583
You're in luck, because I
just happened to put that move

47
00:02:00,666 --> 00:02:04,000
in my little handbook,
<i>136 Coy Poses</i> !

48
00:02:04,083 --> 00:02:06,666
It's one you should always use
when something's really funny--

49
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:08,791
or, of course, when
you're actually surprised.

50
00:02:08,875 --> 00:02:11,291
[PLUM]
<i>Ser gute</i> , Rosia! <i>Jawohl</i> !

51
00:02:11,375 --> 00:02:12,500
I totally see.

52
00:02:12,583 --> 00:02:15,583
[ROSIA] Tsk, tsk, tsk.
Be careful, Jacklyn.

53
00:02:15,666 --> 00:02:18,958
There's a fine line between
being coy and being a phony.

54
00:02:19,041 --> 00:02:20,750
But how will I know
the difference?

55
00:02:20,833 --> 00:02:24,083
I don't know if I'm good
enough to pull that off.

56
00:02:24,166 --> 00:02:26,333
[ROSIA]
Tsukino! That's totes perf!

57
00:02:26,416 --> 00:02:29,500
See? You did even more
than just say "I can't do it."

58
00:02:29,583 --> 00:02:31,541
When you pout like that,
you're also showing the person

59
00:02:31,625 --> 00:02:33,625
that you're so not happy
about the situation,

60
00:02:33,708 --> 00:02:35,958
which is way critical to
get your point across!

61
00:02:36,041 --> 00:02:37,791
By the way, that's
in the book, too.

62
00:02:37,875 --> 00:02:40,750

64
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:45,541
Um, I didn't plan to do that,
it just kinda happened.

00:02:45,625 --> 00:02:47,791
