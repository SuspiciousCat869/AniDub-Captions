00:00:24,375 --> 00:00:28,375
[TOKIKO]
It's Tokiko's R-R-R-Room!

2
00:00:28,458 --> 00:00:32,166
Hello again, everyone.
I'm Tokiko Shirosugawa.

3
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:34,166
Today's guests have
traveled the globe,

4
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:37,166
spreading the beautiful and
mysterious music of the Far East

5
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:38,708
throughout the world.

6
00:00:38,791 --> 00:00:42,916
Let's welcome Tsurezurenaru
Ayatsuri Mugenan.

7
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,583
[DARUDAYU]
Thank you for having us today.

8
00:00:44,666 --> 00:00:45,958
We're honored to be here.

9
00:00:46,041 --> 00:00:47,583
[TOKIKO] You seem flushed.
Are you all right?

10
00:00:47,666 --> 00:00:48,375
Yes.

11
00:00:48,458 --> 00:00:50,250
She's fine. Do not worry.

12
00:00:50,333 --> 00:00:54,500
[TOKIKO] The, uh, daruma person
is, uh-- How do I put it?

13
00:00:54,583 --> 00:00:57,375
Let's go to a
commercial for now.

14
00:00:57,458 --> 00:00:59,833
[sighs]

15
00:00:59,916 --> 00:01:01,708
[DARUDAYU]
Girls, I have returned.

16
00:01:01,791 --> 00:01:02,833
Dear Master.

17
00:01:02,916 --> 00:01:05,250
We gladly welcome you back.

18
00:01:15,125 --> 00:01:16,791
[DARUDAYU]
All I need is one bowl of this

19
00:01:16,875 --> 00:01:19,125
to restore my vitality.

20
00:01:19,208 --> 00:01:22,875
This is Tsurezure-An's
<i>ochazuke</i> .

21
00:01:22,958 --> 00:01:25,833
[TOKIKO] Um, I don't understand
how it works, exactly,

22
00:01:25,916 --> 00:01:28,416
but the daruma person,
you can float, is that right?

23
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:29,958
Well, I'm relieved.

24
00:01:30,041 --> 00:01:31,291
[DARUDAYU]
Yes.

25
00:01:31,375 --> 00:01:33,125
[TOKIKO] All right, please
introduce yourselves.

26
00:01:33,208 --> 00:01:35,458
You may refer to me only as A.

27
00:01:35,541 --> 00:01:37,833
My instrument is
the guitar shamisen.

28
00:01:37,916 --> 00:01:40,083
And I request that
you call me Un.

29
00:01:40,166 --> 00:01:42,666
The bass shamisen
is what I play.

30
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:45,250
[DARUDAYU] And I play drums
as well as dance.

31
00:01:45,333 --> 00:01:47,125
I am the one and only Darudayu.

32
00:01:47,208 --> 00:01:48,583
[yelps]

33
00:01:48,666 --> 00:01:51,958
[TOKIKO] Oh, Miss Daruma--I
mean--Darudayu the Daruma.

34
00:01:52,041 --> 00:01:53,250
I'm trying to be serious here,

35
00:01:53,333 --> 00:01:57,833
but--hah!--the way you
look is just-- I can't!

36
00:01:57,916 --> 00:02:00,708
[DARUDAYU]
Oh? I'm sorry to hear that.

37
00:02:00,791 --> 00:02:04,833
Perhaps I can help alter
your low opinion of me.

38
00:02:04,916 --> 00:02:05,833
[gasps]

39
00:02:05,916 --> 00:02:07,416
What in the--?

40
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:08,875
[A]
Show some respect!

41
00:02:08,958 --> 00:02:11,250
[UN]
Bow down to her!

42
00:02:11,333 --> 00:02:14,500
Don't you know who this
wondrous luminary is?

43
00:02:15,666 --> 00:02:18,583
[A] The very incarnation
of our Far East sound,

44
00:02:18,666 --> 00:02:22,875
the magnificent and
powerful Master Darudayu!

45
00:02:26,166 --> 00:02:28,750
[DARUDAYU] If you work
diligently without ceasing,

46
00:02:28,833 --> 00:02:32,875
you can achieve
anything you dream of.

47
00:02:32,958 --> 00:02:36,541
It's a long-running philosophy
in our music and in life:

48
00:02:36,625 --> 00:02:40,083
Literally,
"Continuation is power."

49
00:02:40,166 --> 00:02:42,500
Now, do your best!

50
00:02:42,583 --> 00:02:45,958
Oh, what wise and virtuous
words you speak, Master!

51
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:49,375
[TOKIKO]
How you doin'?

52
00:02:49,458 --> 00:02:51,791
Wait, why am I doing
a namasté type thing?
