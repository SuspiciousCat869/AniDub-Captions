[SHUZO] Heh. I see you're as
enthusiastic as ever. Good!

Your dauntless dedication
to learning these steps

is quite impressive!

I'm proud of you!

Thanks, but I still need
to work a lot harder.

Since we finally got the
chance to be on your show,

Yeah, little bro,
take it easy, like me!

Maybe Kai can share some
confidence with you, Riku.

He seems to have it to spare.

I'd be happy to share some!

Thanks!

some of Riku's carefulness
and humility.
