[MR. MAPLE]
Attention, everyone.

2
00:00:25,666 --> 00:00:27,250
Today, I'd like to introduce you

3
00:00:27,333 --> 00:00:30,125
to a new student who just
transferred to this school.

4
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:32,125
Let's welcome Rom.

5
00:00:32,208 --> 00:00:33,291
Yo.

6
00:00:33,375 --> 00:00:34,958
[MR. MAPLE]
I want you all to get along.

7
00:00:35,041 --> 00:00:37,583
Be nice, and don't bully him.

8
00:00:37,666 --> 00:00:41,125
I mean it, you guys.
Bullying will not be tolerated.

9
00:00:41,208 --> 00:00:44,416
You know that, right?
Hey, are you listening to me?

10
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:46,625
All right, you asked me
to "step outside."

11
00:00:46,708 --> 00:00:47,791
Now what do you want?

12
00:00:47,875 --> 00:00:50,000
Heh. Don't you get it, buddy?

13
00:00:50,083 --> 00:00:51,416
See, you're the new kid,

14
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:54,000
and you gotta learn how we
run things at this school.

15
00:00:54,083 --> 00:00:55,750
So now, we're gonna rumble.

16
00:00:55,833 --> 00:00:57,083
Huh?

17
00:00:59,125 --> 00:01:02,041
Wait! Crow, stop it!
They said no more fighting!

18
00:01:02,125 --> 00:01:03,125
You leave him alone!

19
00:01:03,208 --> 00:01:05,375
Shut up, stupid!
Mind your own beeswax!

20
00:01:05,458 --> 00:01:07,958
Oh, c'mon now.
You can't be serious.

21
00:01:08,041 --> 00:01:09,375
[CROW]
Hey, you!

22
00:01:09,458 --> 00:01:10,875
You'd better not
underestimate me,

23
00:01:10,958 --> 00:01:13,166
you overgrown cat-tailed poser.

24
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:15,500
I will crush you.

25
00:01:15,583 --> 00:01:19,375
[ROM] Crush me with what?
Your spiky cartoonish hairdo?

26
00:01:20,708 --> 00:01:21,583
[chuckles]

27
00:01:21,666 --> 00:01:23,958
Okay, you're gonna regret that!

28
00:01:24,041 --> 00:01:26,583
[yells]

29
00:01:32,875 --> 00:01:34,583
Wait. Shuzo?

30
00:01:37,333 --> 00:01:40,666
[ROM] Is that the same Shuzo
I've heard so much about?

31
00:01:47,708 --> 00:01:50,166
[ROM]
Hey, so if I defeat you,

32
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:52,458
that makes me number
one around here, right?

33
00:01:52,541 --> 00:01:53,791
Yo, man!

34
00:01:53,875 --> 00:01:55,666
We still have unfinished
business to take care of!

35
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:56,500
[ROM]
Huh?

36
00:01:56,583 --> 00:01:58,666
Don't underestimate m--!

37
00:02:00,833 --> 00:02:01,958
[sighs]

38
00:02:02,041 --> 00:02:05,041
Wow. You pack
quite a punch there.

39
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:06,958
Tell me, what's your name?

40
00:02:07,041 --> 00:02:09,208
You can call me Rom.

41
00:02:09,291 --> 00:02:12,416
Now, show me what
you got, Blondie.

42
00:02:14,291 --> 00:02:16,541
All right, but
you should know,

43
00:02:16,625 --> 00:02:19,500
my power has yet to be matched.

44
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:23,375
[ROM]
Good, then it's a fair fight!

45
00:02:25,666 --> 00:02:26,708
Hi!

46
00:02:26,791 --> 00:02:28,541
Stay tuned to see
who wins this duel

47
00:02:28,625 --> 00:02:30,875
on the second season of
<i>Show By Rock</i> , coming soon!

48
00:02:30,958 --> 00:02:32,458
Hold onto your tails!

49
00:02:32,541 --> 00:02:35,625
The main character transfers to
a super delinquent high school,

50
00:02:35,708 --> 00:02:38,083
and after numerous clashes
with strong opponents,

51
00:02:38,166 --> 00:02:39,208
friendship blossoms.

52
00:02:39,291 --> 00:02:41,041
It's a passionate,
heartwarming drama.

53
00:02:41,125 --> 00:02:43,000
And after that, the
hilarious, forever-young,

54
00:02:43,083 --> 00:02:45,250
rowdy boys' battle show
<i>The Crows</i> comes on!

Passion flows non-stop!
Make sure you watch!

57
00:02:49,583 --> 00:02:50,250
I'm not kidding!

58
00:02:50,333 --> 00:02:51,500
Way to miss the mark.

59
00:02:51,583 --> 00:02:53,333
He does like to exaggerate.

60
00:02:53,416 --> 00:02:55,958
<i>Show By Rock</i> is about
bands, of course.

61
00:02:56,041 --> 00:02:58,583
In Midi City, where
music is everything,

62
00:02:58,666 --> 00:02:59,958
tons of bands aim for the top

63
00:03:00,041 --> 00:03:02,166
in this classic story
of rock star dreams!

64
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:05,083
I can't wait, pyuru!

65
00:03:05,166 --> 00:03:08,375
Everyone, please keep watching
<i>Show By Rock</i> , meow!

66
00:03:08,458 --> 00:03:10,208
Oops, I did it again.

68
00:03:12,791 --> 00:03:14,708
