[TOKIKO] Oh, bravo!
That was just adorable.

11
00:00:57,666 --> 00:00:59,500
Today, these wild,
cheerful scamps

12
00:00:59,583 --> 00:01:00,833
will sit with us for a chat.

13
00:01:00,916 --> 00:01:02,958
But first, a commercial.

14
00:01:04,583 --> 00:01:09,125
The melon flavor is my
favorite! What's yours, Kai?

15
00:01:09,208 --> 00:01:11,125
Well, I like the
grape one the best.

16
00:01:11,208 --> 00:01:13,958
How 'bout you, Shuzo?

17
00:01:14,041 --> 00:01:15,375
[chuckles]

18
00:01:15,458 --> 00:01:17,958

Rainbow! Hooray!

If you buy a box now,
you might find me inside!

22
00:01:25,583 --> 00:01:27,083
[TOKIKO]
I have to say darlings,

23
00:01:27,166 --> 00:01:28,958
you're not at all
what I expected.

24
00:01:29,041 --> 00:01:30,458
I'd heard you were "rowdy boys,"

25
00:01:30,541 --> 00:01:33,375
so frankly, I thought you'd
be a little more, uh, rowdy.

26
00:01:33,458 --> 00:01:34,833
What's that mean?

27
00:01:34,916 --> 00:01:37,208
I resent the assumption
that we're "rowdy boys."

28
00:01:37,291 --> 00:01:39,500
Clearly there's been a terrible
misunderstanding. Hence--

29
00:01:39,583 --> 00:01:40,583
[TOKIKO]
That's nice.

30
00:01:40,666 --> 00:01:42,500
Why don't you introduce
yourselves now?

31
00:01:42,583 --> 00:01:44,041
All right!

32
00:01:44,125 --> 00:01:46,375
Take a look at this, all you
cattle! The great me is here.

33

[ROM]
Shut up!

34
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:48,291
Oy, My table.

35
00:01:48,375 --> 00:01:49,875
I don't like this, man.

36
00:01:49,958 --> 00:01:53,041
Why was an ad with those hacks
playing when we're on the show?

37
00:01:53,125 --> 00:01:55,125
It's an insult to us,
and to music!

38
00:01:55,208 --> 00:01:57,125
Besides, Crow,
you're way too loud,

39
00:01:57,208 --> 00:01:58,375
and you're fidgeting
like a little kid.

40
00:01:58,458 --> 00:02:00,291
[TOKIKO]
Um, we're live now.

41
00:02:00,375 --> 00:02:01,875
[gasps] Oh, hello.

42
00:02:01,958 --> 00:02:05,208
Raw, pure rock music, setting a
thousand crimson souls on fire.

43
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:07,291
That's what we're
about, for real.

44
00:02:07,375 --> 00:02:09,541
I am the humble frontman
of this here group.

45
00:02:09,625 --> 00:02:12,333
I'm Rom, and I, uh,
I play the drums.

Are you okay, hon?

48
00:02:15,625 --> 00:02:17,083
I will tame the savage dragons

49
00:02:17,166 --> 00:02:20,458
with my Legend of Requiem;
that is my purpose.

50
00:02:22,708 --> 00:02:25,916
Lit by crimson flames, the
great Crow has descended again!

51
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,583
Feast your eyes, you cattle!

52
00:02:27,666 --> 00:02:29,416
I'm about to unleash an
amazing and awesome

So get ready to bask
in the glory that is me!
