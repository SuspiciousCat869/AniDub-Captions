1
00:00:23,125 --> 00:00:25,458
[HOLMY] This is the brand-new
Spa Resort Midicians

2
00:00:25,541 --> 00:00:27,291
in the suburbs of Midi City.

3
00:00:27,375 --> 00:00:29,916
Today, we bring you the
behind-the-scenes footage

4
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,625
of when we, Criticrista,
filmed the commercial for it.

5
00:00:33,708 --> 00:00:35,583
[PLANNER] So that's why
we want you, Cri-Cri,

6
00:00:35,666 --> 00:00:37,750
Midi City's current top idols,

7
00:00:37,833 --> 00:00:40,333
to be the beautiful
faces of our spa!

8
00:00:40,416 --> 00:00:41,333
[JACKLYN]
I feel you!

9
00:00:41,416 --> 00:00:42,833
So if we say it's cool,

10
00:00:42,916 --> 00:00:44,791
then all the kids will wanna
hang out here too, right?

11
00:00:44,875 --> 00:00:46,333
[PLANNER]
Yes, to chill out!

12
00:00:46,416 --> 00:00:47,458
Hey, look at this!

13
00:00:47,541 --> 00:00:48,708
They have play areas,

14
00:00:48,791 --> 00:00:50,541
and hot springs where
you can soak as well.

15
00:00:50,625 --> 00:00:52,000
There's so much to do here!

16
00:00:52,083 --> 00:00:53,541
[PLANNER]
Yes, that's right!

17
00:00:53,625 --> 00:00:55,750
And between the new restaurant
and all the poolside stands,

18
00:00:55,833 --> 00:00:58,208
it looks like no one
will go hungry, either!

19
00:00:58,291 --> 00:01:01,041
'Scuse me, I have a suggestion.

20
00:01:01,125 --> 00:01:02,208
[PLANNER]
Yes, go ahead!

21
00:01:02,291 --> 00:01:04,083
For the last line of the script,

22
00:01:04,166 --> 00:01:06,083
I think it would get the
point across way better

23
00:01:06,166 --> 00:01:08,625
if I said this:
"Hey, Big Brothers!

24
00:01:08,708 --> 00:01:10,541
You should totally go
to Midicians Spa.

25
00:01:10,625 --> 00:01:12,375
You can play, eat, and relax!"

26
00:01:12,458 --> 00:01:13,958
That'll work well, yeah?

27
00:01:14,041 --> 00:01:15,500
And I'll look straight
at the camera,

28
00:01:15,583 --> 00:01:18,333
'cause it's real important to
make eye contact, you know.

29
00:01:18,416 --> 00:01:20,833
[PLANNER]
What a wonderful idea!

30
00:01:22,166 --> 00:01:25,125
[HOLMY] Today is our costume
fitting for the shoot.

31
00:01:25,208 --> 00:01:27,375
Huh... There's
something missing.

32
00:01:27,458 --> 00:01:29,458
What's wrong, Jacklyn?
Are you okay?

33
00:01:29,541 --> 00:01:32,500
I just think it needs a little
something more to make it pop.

34
00:01:32,583 --> 00:01:35,125
Ooh, maybe you're right.

35
00:01:36,708 --> 00:01:40,375
Sweet, now it looks
totally savage!

36
00:01:40,458 --> 00:01:41,958
[TSUKINO]
Thanks to Jacklyn's idea,

37
00:01:42,041 --> 00:01:46,125
our costumes went
from "okay" to "Hey!'"

38
00:01:46,208 --> 00:01:49,666
[ROSIA] Now, it's finally time
to start filming the commercial.

39
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:52,250
Today was the soft opening
of the restaurant.

40
00:01:52,333 --> 00:01:54,708
And Tsukino was over the moon!

41
00:01:54,791 --> 00:01:55,708
Yum!

42
00:01:55,791 --> 00:01:57,125
Matcha and vanilla
swirl ice cream

43
00:01:57,208 --> 00:01:59,625
is a traditional pairing that's
always super delicious;

44
00:01:59,708 --> 00:02:01,291
one of my favorites.

45
00:02:01,375 --> 00:02:03,541
But I didn't expect the
mix of mint and caramel

46
00:02:03,625 --> 00:02:05,291
to be so amazingly yummy, too!

47
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:07,375
So I love 'em both!

48
00:02:07,458 --> 00:02:09,291
[ROSIA] By the way,
while we were filming,

49
00:02:09,375 --> 00:02:11,708
Tsukino's idea
became a new flavor!

50
00:02:11,791 --> 00:02:14,958
Now it'll always be on the menu!

51
00:02:15,041 --> 00:02:16,541
[JACKLYN] To go along
with the TV commercial,

52
00:02:16,625 --> 00:02:18,708
we had a rad poster photoshoot.

53
00:02:18,791 --> 00:02:20,833
[ROSIA]
Woo!

54
00:02:21,791 --> 00:02:23,500
[CREATOR]
Nice height! I love it!

55
00:02:23,583 --> 00:02:26,375
[HOLMY] I'm sorry, but her dive
was a little bit sloppy there.

56
00:02:26,458 --> 00:02:28,208
It looked a little odd.

57
00:02:30,875 --> 00:02:34,208
Hey, Rosia, you think
you can do it again?

58
00:02:34,291 --> 00:02:37,000
I don't think, I know!

59
00:02:37,083 --> 00:02:40,166
[JACKLYN, ROSIA] Check it!
Here's how it turned out.

60
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:41,291
Hey, Big Brothers!

61
00:02:41,375 --> 00:02:43,750
You should totally
go to Midicians spa.

62
00:02:43,833 --> 00:02:47,375
You can play, eat, and relax.

63
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:51,791
