You know what Ash said.
Remember?

00:11:05.165 --> 00:11:08.468
He said that, "Nothing we
ever do is a waste of time."

00:11:11.004 --> 00:11:14.841
And that means I'm going to use
everything I've learned.

Oh, you.

Huh?

00:18:35.281 --> 00:18:37.583
I'm sorry.
It was all my fault.

But you know what?

00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:44.724
You see, I've never
felt like this before.

00:18:44.724 --> 00:18:47.793
Know why? I'm a performer now.

Palermo? Did you see
anybody of interest?

Hm, it's a secret.

I'll go look. Huh!

What in the world did you do?

You chopped most of it off!

Come on!

00:20:11.777 --> 00:20:14.313
I liked your long hair!

Time for a change.
I think it looks kind of cute.

It's the present you gave me.
