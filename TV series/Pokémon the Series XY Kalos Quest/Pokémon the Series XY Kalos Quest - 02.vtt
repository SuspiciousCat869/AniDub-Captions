Dark Hawlucha?

00:08:56.503 --> 00:08:59.205
Maybe it's working
on stage dives.

00:09:00.707 --> 00:09:02.942
It sure moves fast.

00:09:02.942 --> 00:09:06.079

It is quick.

00:09:09.983 --> 00:09:12.919
Although Dark Hawlucha
only battles in shows now

00:09:12.919 --> 00:09:15.422
it was so powerful
that it competed in

00:09:15.422 --> 00:09:17.657
and won the Kalos region's
prestigious

00:09:17.657 --> 00:09:19.793

00:09:19.793 --> 00:09:21.961

00:09:28.768 --> 00:09:31.171
Whoa. Dark Hawlucha
was a champion?

[SURPRISED]

00:09:32.405 --> 00:09:35.408
Yes, and I coached it
in many tournaments

00:09:35.408 --> 00:09:38.344
but during one of those
tournaments it was hurt.

00:09:38.344 --> 00:09:40.647
Hawlucha hasn't competed
in a full‐on battle

00:09:40.647 --> 00:09:43.483
ever since that injury.

00:09:43.483 --> 00:09:46.886
So that's why I came up with
the Super Pokémon Battle Show

00:09:46.886 --> 00:09:48.655
which is much less
physically demanding

00:09:48.655 --> 00:09:50.223
than a Pokémon battle is.

00:09:50.223 --> 00:09:52.559
So that's what happened.

00:09:52.559 --> 00:09:54.794
These days
Dark Hawlucha works hard

00:09:54.794 --> 00:09:57.430
to make our Super Pokémon
Battle Shows the best.

00:09:57.430 --> 00:10:00.133
Lighting up the stage
is its number‐one goal.

00:10:00.133 --> 00:10:03.303
So it takes genuine pride
in performing.

00:10:03.303 --> 00:10:07.273
Yes, regardless of injury,
Dark Hawlucha's always been

00:10:07.273 --> 00:10:09.542
a very proud Pokémon.

After you're thrown,
you bounce off the wall

How could I ever stop
Dark Hawlucha

00:17:54.907 --> 00:17:56.475
with passion like that?

00:17:56.475 --> 00:17:58.077
Go, both of you!

Dark Hawlucha
won't give up, either!

I wish I could
understand them, too

00:18:39.819 --> 00:18:41.988
but there's no doubt
that Dark Hawlucha's having

00:18:41.988 --> 00:18:43.289
a wonderful time.

00:18:43.289 --> 00:18:46.692

Wow! Magnificent!

00:19:11.717 --> 00:19:13.586
I was worried about the outcome

00:19:13.586 --> 00:19:16.155
but I never thought
it would end like this.

00:19:16.155 --> 00:19:19.291
‐ Thank goodness.
‐ What a nerve‐racking show.

00:19:19.291 --> 00:19:22.428

who should be
thanking all of you.

00:19:56.162 --> 00:19:58.030

Dark Hawlucha's satisfied
