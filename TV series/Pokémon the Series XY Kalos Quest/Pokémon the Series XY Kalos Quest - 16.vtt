Now, a performance
by our talented new star.

00:00:06.507 --> 00:00:09.910
So please give a warm welcome

that Shauna's famous now.

I've really gotta practice hard
so I can catch up to Shauna.

Thanks for your patience.

00:00:30.197 --> 00:00:33.267
Your Pokémon are all fully
recovered and feeling fine.

00:00:33.267 --> 00:00:35.068

Then Pancham will jump,
go under here then finish up.

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:38.298
I think we should
give it a try, okay?

as a cheering crowd. All set?

‐ Okay, now, calm down.
‐ Huh?

Attaining the status
of top Pokémon performer

00:04:35.041 --> 00:04:38.178
doesn't necessarily mean you'll
be conquering all of Kalos.

What's that supposed to mean?

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:42.282

that will bring me adoration

this one suits you much better.

Huh?

00:05:17.951 --> 00:05:19.953
I thought you were wondering
about which one of these

00:05:19.953 --> 00:05:21.855
was better.

00:05:21.855 --> 00:05:23.223
No, not at all.

about something else.

‐ Hey, don't look so sad.
‐ Huh?

Really, if you keep
that look up

00:05:30.797 --> 00:05:33.366
your poor face will wind up
staying that way.

00:05:33.366 --> 00:05:36.403
‐ Huh?
‐ Always keep smiling.

00:05:36.403 --> 00:05:39.005
That's the secret for looking
and feeling great.

‐ That's right. Just like that.

somewhere before.

Hey. I know.

00:05:46.847 --> 00:05:51.318
Why don't we shift gears and do
some serious shopping together?

00:05:51.318 --> 00:05:53.987
I finally have some time off
and I know there are some shops

00:05:53.987 --> 00:05:55.689
that I've really wanted
to check out

00:05:55.689 --> 00:05:58.124
but it's boring to go
by myself.

00:05:58.124 --> 00:06:01.228
‐ So, please?
‐ Ha‐ha. Sure.

00:06:01.228 --> 00:06:04.598
My name is A, uh,
my name's Ariana.

‐ Hi, I'm Serena.

‐ And it's nice to meet you.
‐ Great.

Of course.

00:06:18.912 --> 00:06:22.148
You know, I was wondering
where I'd seen you before.

00:06:22.148 --> 00:06:24.517
I saw you
in the Pokémon Showcase.

00:06:24.517 --> 00:06:27.120
You saw the Coumarine Showcase,
Ariana?

in person

but I watched it later
on Pokévision.

00:06:30.857 --> 00:06:32.626
I sure goofed up.

00:06:32.626 --> 00:06:35.996
I made some big‐time mistakes
and then got eliminated.

And I got mad
at my Pokémon today.

00:06:38.598 --> 00:06:41.701
I feel like I'm the worst
Pokémon performer ever.

Everybody makes mistakes.

00:06:43.503 --> 00:06:46.206
Nobody ever does it perfectly
the first time around.

00:06:46.206 --> 00:06:48.842
But Shauna sure did.
She won it.

00:06:48.842 --> 00:06:52.746
I really wanna be just like
Aria, the Kalos Queen.

'It's what I dream about.
Hm.'

is better?'

Then this one it is.

00:07:09.963 --> 00:07:13.533

this one's really cute too.

‐ I can't decide!
‐ He‐he‐he.

‐ See? There's that face.
‐ Huh?

00:07:18.972 --> 00:07:21.174

always has to wear

00:07:21.174 --> 00:07:23.476
a wonderfully radiant smile.

if she finds out

So your worries
are about Clemont. Got it.

Clemont can mess stuff up.

the best he can.

[EXERTION]

00:08:25.972 --> 00:08:27.307
Are you alright, Treecko?

[CHEERING]

00:08:30.443 --> 00:08:32.746
Luxray, use Wild Charge.

00:08:32.746 --> 00:08:34.481
[WILD CHARGE MOVE]

[DAZED]

00:08:37.917 --> 00:08:40.153
Treecko is unable to battle

00:08:40.153 --> 00:08:43.823
so the winner is
the Gym Leader Clemont.

00:08:43.823 --> 00:08:45.792
[panting]

00:08:45.792 --> 00:08:49.662
Treecko, you were great.
Awesome. You were so good.

00:08:49.662 --> 00:08:53.400
‐ Gym Leaders are strong.
‐ You were quite good too.

00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:55.869
But it was when you decided
to use your Mega Drain

00:08:55.869 --> 00:08:59.372
that left you a big opening
for me to make my counterattack.

00:08:59.372 --> 00:09:02.108
Oh. I got it now.

00:09:02.108 --> 00:09:03.576
That really helps me a lot.

00:09:03.576 --> 00:09:06.046
Thank you very much
for the tip.

00:09:06.046 --> 00:09:09.382
[thinking] Wow. I feel like I'm
really on to something.

00:09:09.382 --> 00:09:11.384
You'll see, Ash.

00:09:13.319 --> 00:09:15.522
Yum.
This looks so good.

00:09:15.522 --> 00:09:18.525
We're in the famous cafe that's
in all the guidebooks, right?

00:09:18.525 --> 00:09:21.327
That's right. I've always wanted
to come here and eat.

00:09:21.327 --> 00:09:23.763
SERENA/ARIA
So let's dig in. Ready?

00:09:23.763 --> 00:09:26.433
Mm. Mm. Mm. Mm.

00:09:26.433 --> 00:09:28.601
It's delish.

00:09:30.537 --> 00:09:33.473
It just melts in your mouth.
Right, Fennekin?

00:09:33.473 --> 00:09:34.908
‐ Ah.
‐ Hm.

00:09:34.908 --> 00:09:38.278
You two are always together,
aren't you?

00:09:38.278 --> 00:09:40.747
Yeah, Fennekin and I
have been together

00:09:40.747 --> 00:09:42.515
since the very beginning
of my journey

00:09:42.515 --> 00:09:44.951
and although Pancham
isn't always upfront with me

00:09:44.951 --> 00:09:48.121
it's very sweet
and lots of fun.

00:09:48.121 --> 00:09:49.923
I know they're doing
the best they can

00:09:49.923 --> 00:09:53.293

but..

00:09:53.293 --> 00:09:56.830
Here, Furfrou.
Open wide.

00:09:56.830 --> 00:09:58.431
Is it yummy?

[PLEASED]

00:09:59.699 --> 00:10:02.902
Aw. That tickles.
He‐he‐he.

00:10:05.038 --> 00:10:08.141
Maybe they won't wanna
perform with me anymore.

ARIANA 'They're your precious
friends, right?'

Huh?

00:10:12.979 --> 00:10:16.282
Do you want things
to stay like this?

00:10:16.282 --> 00:10:20.520
Serena, I'm sure anything
that's important to you

00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:24.624
is something your Pokémon
really care about too.

00:10:24.624 --> 00:10:27.160
Ah. You think so?

00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:30.263
First off, why don't you
apologize to them?

00:10:30.263 --> 00:10:32.966
Even if you had a fight,
you can always make up

00:10:32.966 --> 00:10:35.435
which is what makes you
true partners, right?

00:10:35.435 --> 00:10:38.805
Ha‐ha‐ha. Right.

00:10:38.805 --> 00:10:41.174

Who's that Pokémon?

00:10:46.212 --> 00:10:48.414
It's Treecko.

'Not acceptable.'

'Not at all.'

00:10:58.925 --> 00:11:01.261
Yeah.
You can scream that again.

00:11:01.261 --> 00:11:03.263
‐ Pay attention.
‐ Ah.

00:11:03.263 --> 00:11:06.299
I need to put on a flashier
and more elegant performance

00:11:06.299 --> 00:11:08.501
to become queen,
isn't that right?

00:11:08.501 --> 00:11:12.539
‐ Pal, you gotta help me out.
‐ Leave me out of this.

00:11:12.539 --> 00:11:15.742
‐ 'Now, get up, pronto.'
‐ Ah!

00:11:15.742 --> 00:11:17.810

Why do I have to get up too?

00:11:17.810 --> 00:11:20.780

Argh. Because I said so.

00:11:22.448 --> 00:11:25.385

‐ Huh?
‐ Huh?

'Serena.'

‐ Hi, everyone. I'm back.
‐ Hm.

[SAD]

00:11:47.006 --> 00:11:49.209
See, they both feel really bad
about what happened

00:11:49.209 --> 00:11:51.110
and they've been worried
about you too.

00:11:51.110 --> 00:11:54.447
Don't feel bad. I messed up.
I'm sorry.

[SAD]

00:11:56.516 --> 00:11:58.117
Ha‐ha‐ha.

00:11:58.117 --> 00:12:01.554
Oh, being away made me
realize something.

00:12:01.554 --> 00:12:04.290
You two are my
precious partners.

that you guys made up.

00:12:10.597 --> 00:12:14.467
So these Pokémon
are your partners, Serena?

00:12:14.467 --> 00:12:17.637
Mm‐hm. You've got
such a good connection.

00:12:17.637 --> 00:12:19.138
‐ Who are you?
‐ Huh?

00:12:19.138 --> 00:12:21.841
Oh, this is Ariana.
And I met her in town.

00:12:21.841 --> 00:12:25.812
Hi. My name's Ash. And up on top
is my partner, Pikachu.

[HAPPY]

00:12:27.013 --> 00:12:29.482
Bonnie's my name.
This is Dedenne.

Nice to meet you.

00:12:33.186 --> 00:12:35.722
Ah. Wow.
You're a keeper.

00:12:35.722 --> 00:12:37.724
Although my brother's
not here right now

00:12:37.724 --> 00:12:40.360
I'd sure like it
if you'd take care of him.

00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:42.128
Uh, uh, take care of him?

00:12:42.128 --> 00:12:45.365
‐ Well, uh..
‐ Can you stop, Bonnie?

00:12:45.365 --> 00:12:47.700
Well, it's just that
Ariana's so pretty.

00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:49.269
Now, isn't that sweet?

00:12:49.269 --> 00:12:52.205
I'll introduce you two
when we see him.

00:12:52.205 --> 00:12:54.340
He's a really
dependable brother.

00:12:54.340 --> 00:12:56.009
[chuckles]

00:12:56.009 --> 00:12:59.412
Hey, Serena, wanna have
a Double Battle against me

00:12:59.412 --> 00:13:00.847
Huh?

00:13:00.847 --> 00:13:03.583
You might learn a lot by
battling with your Pokémon now.

00:13:03.583 --> 00:13:06.419
And I think
it would be a lot of fun.

00:13:06.419 --> 00:13:10.223
Battling with my Pokémon?
Huh.

00:13:10.223 --> 00:13:11.891
Sounds like a great
idea to me.

00:13:11.891 --> 00:13:13.293
You think so?

00:13:13.293 --> 00:13:14.727
Now, that you've made up

00:13:14.727 --> 00:13:17.664
show her what an awesome team
the three of you can be.

00:13:17.664 --> 00:13:20.833
I think you're right.
I'll give it a shot.

00:13:23.202 --> 00:13:25.338
[EXCITED]

00:13:25.338 --> 00:13:28.441
‐ Serena, you can do it!
‐ Go for it.

00:13:28.441 --> 00:13:30.343
Thanks for the opportunity.

00:13:30.343 --> 00:13:32.812
Now, I'm gonna bring out
my Pokémon.

00:13:32.812 --> 00:13:35.448
Come on out, Delphox,
Aromatisse.

[APPEARING]

00:13:39.118 --> 00:13:41.254
Wow, Ariana's partners.

00:13:43.156 --> 00:13:45.325
Aromatisse,
the Fragrance Pokémon

00:13:45.325 --> 00:13:47.160
and the evolved form
of Spritzee.

many scents'

'to gain the advantage
in battle.'

Huh? Hm.

00:13:55.001 --> 00:13:57.103
Delphox, the Fox Pokémon

00:13:57.103 --> 00:13:59.505
and Fennekin's final
evolved form.

00:13:59.505 --> 00:14:02.241
'By focusing on the flame
at the tip of its branch'

00:14:02.241 --> 00:14:05.044
'Delphox can see
into the future.'

00:14:06.546 --> 00:14:09.482
Fennekin's final evolved form.
Hm.

00:14:09.482 --> 00:14:11.617
Fennekin, Pancham,
let's do our best!

00:14:11.617 --> 00:14:14.587

Fennekin, Scratch,
let's go.

[EXERTION]

00:14:23.930 --> 00:14:26.699
Aromatisse, use Reflect.

[REFLECT MOVE]

00:14:29.502 --> 00:14:30.970
[SURPRISED]

00:14:30.970 --> 00:14:32.939
It got blocked.

00:14:32.939 --> 00:14:35.842
Now, Delphox,
use Mystical Fire.

00:14:35.842 --> 00:14:37.977
[MYSTICAL FIRE MOVE]

‐ Pancham, are you okay?
‐ Whoa, that was amazing. Wow.

00:14:44.317 --> 00:14:47.553
That's what I'd expect from
Fennekin's final evolved form.

00:14:47.553 --> 00:14:49.522
It's so beautiful to watch

00:14:49.522 --> 00:14:52.525
'the way Delphox
and Aromatisse battle.'

00:14:52.525 --> 00:14:55.294
Well, how do you like
our performance?

00:14:55.294 --> 00:14:56.429
Huh?

00:14:56.429 --> 00:14:58.598
You're a Pokémon performer,
Ariana?

00:14:58.598 --> 00:15:02.101
That's right.
I forgot to tell you.

00:15:02.101 --> 00:15:04.637
So this is
a performer's battle.

00:15:04.637 --> 00:15:07.573
Right. And the performance
is just getting started.

00:15:07.573 --> 00:15:10.543
Right. Pancham, use Stone Edge
on Aromatisse.

00:15:10.543 --> 00:15:13.446
[STONE EDGE MOVE]

00:15:14.714 --> 00:15:16.783
‐ So cool.
‐ Wait.

00:15:16.783 --> 00:15:18.951
It looks like
the Reflect is still active.

00:15:21.254 --> 00:15:22.321
Huh?

00:15:22.321 --> 00:15:24.590
‐ 'You have to work together.'
‐ Huh?

00:15:24.590 --> 00:15:27.193
The cooperation between
Trainer and Pokémon

00:15:27.193 --> 00:15:30.763
and between Pokémon themselves
is important in a Double Battle.

00:15:30.763 --> 00:15:33.433
'You can't win if you don't
work together.'

00:15:33.433 --> 00:15:36.536
Can't win if we don't
work together?

00:15:36.536 --> 00:15:38.271
Huh?

00:15:38.271 --> 00:15:42.341
That's right. It's what Ash
always says when he battles.

00:15:42.341 --> 00:15:44.944
Alright, let's trust each other
and work together!

Reflect won't block
an attack from above.

00:15:58.124 --> 00:16:00.426
Now, Fennekin,
use Flamethrower!

[FLAMETHROWER MOVE]

00:16:02.361 --> 00:16:04.163

[CONCERNED]

00:16:33.092 --> 00:16:37.330
No, I can't do anything.

00:16:37.330 --> 00:16:40.800
Always has to wear
a wonderfully radiant smile.

00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:43.069
Huh? My smile..

00:16:43.069 --> 00:16:44.837
Fennekin, Pancham.

00:16:44.837 --> 00:16:48.574
Don't worry,
I truly believe in you two.

00:16:48.574 --> 00:16:51.277
After all,
you're the greatest partners

00:16:51.277 --> 00:16:52.912
in the whole wide world.

‐ Huh? Check it out.
‐ What's going on?

00:17:06.025 --> 00:17:08.361
Fennekin..

00:17:08.361 --> 00:17:09.662
[CURIOUS]

00:17:09.662 --> 00:17:10.763
Hi, Fennekin.

00:17:10.763 --> 00:17:11.764
[EXCITED]

00:17:11.764 --> 00:17:14.033
Ha‐ha. Hm.

[APPEARING]

[EXCITED]

00:17:24.510 --> 00:17:25.578
It evolved.

00:17:25.578 --> 00:17:27.013
That's awesome.

00:17:27.013 --> 00:17:29.582
[AGREEMENT]

00:17:34.353 --> 00:17:36.322
Braixen, the Fox Pokémon

00:17:36.322 --> 00:17:38.190
and the evolved form
of Fennekin.

'Braixen uses friction to
ignite the twig from its tail'

[EXCITED]

00:17:43.996 --> 00:17:45.431
Huh?

00:17:45.431 --> 00:17:49.702
You see? Your Pokémon answered
your heartfelt call.

00:17:49.702 --> 00:17:54.073
Just like I said.
Your two hearts became one.

00:17:54.073 --> 00:17:55.975
[AGREEMENT]

00:17:57.276 --> 00:18:00.313
Right. And thank you so much.

00:18:00.313 --> 00:18:03.349
Now, this battle's really
heating up.

00:18:03.349 --> 00:18:05.952
Time to show us the bond
between all of you.

00:18:05.952 --> 00:18:06.953
Right.

00:18:06.953 --> 00:18:08.721
Okay, here we come.

00:18:08.721 --> 00:18:12.725
Use Flamethrower and Dark Pulse.
Perfect partners!

[FLAMETHROWER MOVE]

‐ Look at that.
‐ That is so cool.

00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:31.510
Those moves, what you did
with them just now was amazing.

00:18:31.510 --> 00:18:34.213
It was.
Thank you so much.

00:18:34.213 --> 00:18:36.849
I guess it's time now for me
to get serious.

00:18:36.849 --> 00:18:38.918
Yeah, and me too!

00:18:38.918 --> 00:18:41.287
‐ Huh?
‐ Huh?

00:18:41.287 --> 00:18:43.422
What's going on?

00:18:43.422 --> 00:18:48.561
ARIANA 'Hello. Yes, I know.
I'll be back right away.'

00:18:48.561 --> 00:18:50.463
I'm so sorry, guys.

00:18:50.463 --> 00:18:52.431
I kind of have to go back now.

00:18:52.431 --> 00:18:55.768
No.
But there's a battle going on.

00:18:55.768 --> 00:18:57.403
‐ 'We'll have to end it here.'
‐ Uh..

00:18:57.403 --> 00:19:00.206
‐ No way.
‐ You were both great.

00:19:00.206 --> 00:19:02.308
Thanks, Delphox, Aromatisse.

00:19:02.308 --> 00:19:05.978
Ariana, I don't know
how to thank you for today.

00:19:05.978 --> 00:19:10.549
Heh. And don't forget, you've
got a great smile to show off.

00:19:10.549 --> 00:19:13.719
Thanks. I'll remember that.

00:19:13.719 --> 00:19:16.989
‐ 'Let's meet on stage someday.'
‐ 'Definitely.'

00:19:18.457 --> 00:19:21.661
‐ See you.
‐ Bye.

‐ Thanks for everything.
‐ Bye‐bye.

[EXERTION]

00:19:25.464 --> 00:19:26.499

[PLEASED]

00:19:28.300 --> 00:19:32.605
You were amazing too, Braixen.
So were you, Pancham.

00:19:32.605 --> 00:19:33.806
[HAPPY]

00:19:33.806 --> 00:19:35.207
[PLEASED]

00:19:44.717 --> 00:19:48.387
‐ Let's get to Lumiose City.
‐ Clemont's waiting there.

00:19:48.387 --> 00:19:52.124
‐ Bet he's excited.
‐ Okay, Clemont, here we come.

00:19:52.124 --> 00:19:53.292
[chuckles]

00:19:53.292 --> 00:19:55.361
‐ You sure are pumped up, Ash.
‐ Yeah.

00:19:55.361 --> 00:19:57.329
I can't wait
for my next Gym battle.

00:19:57.329 --> 00:20:00.066
‐ 'Ladies and gentlemen.'
‐ Huh?

00:20:00.066 --> 00:20:01.534
The time has finally come.

00:20:01.534 --> 00:20:03.202
The time for Kalos Queen

00:20:03.202 --> 00:20:05.938
Mademoiselle Aria's
breathtaking performance.

00:20:05.938 --> 00:20:08.040
'Here she is.'

00:20:12.044 --> 00:20:15.481
I can't believe
how cute Aria is.

00:20:15.481 --> 00:20:16.982
[gasps]

00:20:22.555 --> 00:20:24.690
Ha‐ha‐ha.

00:20:24.690 --> 00:20:26.225
[thinking]
I'll do my best.

00:20:26.225 --> 00:20:29.228
And someday, I'll be as great
as a Pokémon performer

00:20:29.228 --> 00:20:32.331
as you, Aria. You'll see.

00:20:34.100 --> 00:20:35.868
What are you waiting for?

00:20:35.868 --> 00:20:37.069
‐ Huh?
‐ Huh?

00:20:37.069 --> 00:20:38.771
What's the hurry, Serena?

00:20:38.771 --> 00:20:40.539
Hey, wait for me.

00:20:40.539 --> 00:20:43.008
NARRATOR And so, after some
advice from none other

00:20:43.008 --> 00:20:44.443
than the Kalos Queen

00:20:44.443 --> 00:20:47.046
Serena's partnership
with her Pokémon has grown

00:20:47.046 --> 00:20:51.917
just a little bit closer,
as the journey continues.

00:20:56.822 --> 00:20:59.925
