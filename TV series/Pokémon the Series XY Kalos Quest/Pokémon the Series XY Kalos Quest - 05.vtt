Wow. You guys really did it.

I gotta say you were really
moving on that Rhyhorn.

I can see now that you really do
have what it takes.

00:15:34.233 --> 00:15:36.936
I mean, to be
a professional Rhyhorn racer.

Mom..

to come back home with me

and start training again.

you'd be leaving us.

I'll say it.

You see, mom..

00:15:53.853 --> 00:15:57.824
...I've decided I wanna become
a Pokémon performer..

...which means
I'm not going home.

Are you serious?

00:16:02.462 --> 00:16:05.498
Dear, as soon as you think
it's getting too hard

00:16:05.498 --> 00:16:07.066
you'll simply give up.

00:16:07.066 --> 00:16:09.402

But, mom, if I win,
you have to respect my dreams.

That's crazy.

Your mother's a professional
Rhyhorn racer after all.

He's right.

00:16:25.051 --> 00:16:27.920
In that case,
we'll have our race on Skiddo.

CLEMONT Well, I'm sure
she'd lose in a Rhyhorn race

00:16:37.430 --> 00:16:40.967
but in a Skiddo race, I think
she might just have a chance.

00:16:40.967 --> 00:16:43.069
Right, compared to Rhyhorn

00:16:43.069 --> 00:16:45.137
Skiddo would do much better
with a light rider

00:16:45.137 --> 00:16:49.375
and that favors you,
but we'll see.
