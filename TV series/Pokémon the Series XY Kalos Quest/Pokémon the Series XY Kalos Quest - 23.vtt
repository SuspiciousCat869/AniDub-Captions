‐ Pangoro again!
‐ Wow.

00:17:07.660 --> 00:17:08.961
They don't give up!

00:17:08.961 --> 00:17:10.563
[FURIOUS]

00:17:10.563 --> 00:17:12.498
[ANGRY]/[DETERMINED]

00:17:14.700 --> 00:17:17.036
[ANGRY]

00:17:17.036 --> 00:17:18.337
[ANGRY]

00:17:18.337 --> 00:17:21.274
Meowth, come on!
You know what they're saying.

00:17:21.274 --> 00:17:24.277
‐ So tell us right now!
‐ Don't push me.

00:17:24.277 --> 00:17:25.311
Alright!

00:17:25.311 --> 00:17:27.613
[ANGRY]

00:17:27.613 --> 00:17:30.750
I guess, they're having a
problem with their food supply.

00:17:30.750 --> 00:17:32.151
Their food supply?

00:17:35.154 --> 00:17:37.290
See that's their tree.

00:17:37.290 --> 00:17:39.258
[ANGRY]

00:17:39.258 --> 00:17:42.028
Pangoro says this
tree grows gobs of grub.

00:17:42.028 --> 00:17:43.362
So every year,
they get together

00:17:43.362 --> 00:17:46.599
and divide up
that grub between them.

00:17:46.599 --> 00:17:48.734
So all of a sudden
they see some crooks

00:17:48.734 --> 00:17:52.104
who steal all their berries
and then run away..

00:17:52.104 --> 00:17:55.775
‐ You mean, it was you, huh?
‐ Shh!

00:17:55.775 --> 00:17:57.743
So, you're the cause
of all this.

00:17:57.743 --> 00:17:59.845
‐ Hey, I didn't know.
‐ Tough break.

00:17:59.845 --> 00:18:01.647
What can we say?

00:18:01.647 --> 00:18:03.849
Maybe you could just
tell them you're really sorry.

00:18:03.849 --> 00:18:05.051
[DISAPPOINTED]

00:18:05.051 --> 00:18:07.053
[PROUD]

00:18:07.053 --> 00:18:08.688
They saw you holding their grub

00:18:08.688 --> 00:18:11.157
so they thought
you Twerps took it.

00:18:11.157 --> 00:18:13.793
We just picked up the berries
where we found them.

00:18:13.793 --> 00:18:16.062
The real bad guys
are Team Rocket!

00:18:16.062 --> 00:18:18.364
Hey, no fair! Don't bust me.

00:18:18.364 --> 00:18:20.333
[CONFUSED]

00:18:20.333 --> 00:18:23.169
You know, I've asked
myself the same thing.

00:18:23.169 --> 00:18:25.271
‐ Good question‐‐
‐ There you are.

00:18:25.271 --> 00:18:26.906
We've been searching
everywhere.

00:18:26.906 --> 00:18:28.774
Look! Three Pangoro.

00:18:28.774 --> 00:18:31.243
Why did you have
to show up now?

00:18:31.243 --> 00:18:33.679
Prepare for trouble,
it's now or never.

00:18:33.679 --> 00:18:35.748
And make it double.
We're all together!

00:18:35.748 --> 00:18:38.117
Well, this time
that's not a good thing.

00:18:38.117 --> 00:18:40.486
To protect the world
from devastation!

00:18:40.486 --> 00:18:43.055
To unite all people
within our nation!

00:18:43.055 --> 00:18:46.425
To denounce the evils
of truth and love!

00:18:46.425 --> 00:18:49.128
To extend our reach
to the stars above!

00:18:49.128 --> 00:18:51.931
‐ Jessie!
‐ And James!

00:18:51.931 --> 00:18:54.934
Team Rocket blasts off
at the speed of light!

00:18:54.934 --> 00:18:57.970
Surrender now or prepare
for a reunification fight!

00:18:57.970 --> 00:18:59.205
Meowth, that's right!

00:18:59.205 --> 00:19:00.873
[PROUD]

00:19:02.942 --> 00:19:05.111
Oopsie,
guess the catchy lyrics

00:19:05.111 --> 00:19:07.146
dragged me in.

00:19:07.146 --> 00:19:09.115
Excuse me?
Dragged into what?

00:19:10.416 --> 00:19:12.051
[FURIOUS]

00:19:16.722 --> 00:19:19.458
Bad move.

00:19:19.458 --> 00:19:22.795
Now, that they know it was us,
they're not too pleased.

00:19:23.896 --> 00:19:26.065
Not pleased?
What does that mean?

00:19:26.065 --> 00:19:27.767
That sounds dangerous.

00:19:27.767 --> 00:19:30.102
[ATTACK]

00:19:30.102 --> 00:19:31.570
[screaming]

00:19:31.570 --> 00:19:35.107
‐ Our motto caused this?
‐ Long story!

00:19:35.107 --> 00:19:37.843
JAMES
We're blasting off again!

00:19:37.843 --> 00:19:38.911
ASH
Now.

00:19:38.911 --> 00:19:41.213
[HAPPY]

00:19:41.213 --> 00:19:43.749
‐ Here are your berries!
‐ That's all of them.

00:19:43.749 --> 00:19:46.952
Yup! Now,
you've got them all back.

00:19:46.952 --> 00:19:48.521
[GRATEFUL]

00:19:50.923 --> 00:19:54.293
So dig in! Huh? For me?

00:19:54.293 --> 00:19:56.262
Awesome. Thanks a lot!

00:19:56.262 --> 00:19:59.098
I think they're sorry.
This is so nice!

00:19:59.098 --> 00:20:02.768
It sure is. Alright,
we know just what to do.

00:20:04.036 --> 00:20:05.971
[HAPPY]

00:20:05.971 --> 00:20:07.640
Let's eat!

00:20:09.575 --> 00:20:11.010
That's good!

00:20:13.779 --> 00:20:17.516
‐ See you later, Pangoro!
‐ Be well, everybody!

00:20:17.516 --> 00:20:20.152
‐ Thanks for the food!
‐ Bye‐bye!

00:20:23.055 --> 00:20:26.125
Tied to Meowth with a vine?
That sounds awful.

00:20:26.125 --> 00:20:29.361
Your fortune said you'd have
the worst day of the year.

00:20:29.361 --> 00:20:31.597
It wasn't all that bad.

00:20:31.597 --> 00:20:34.533
Actually, it was fun.
Even with Meowth.

00:20:34.533 --> 00:20:35.601
Right, Dedenne?

00:20:35.601 --> 00:20:36.635
[HAPPY]

00:20:36.635 --> 00:20:38.404
You're kidding.

00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:44.210
NARRATOR Although our heroes and
their Pokémon were separated

00:20:44.210 --> 00:20:47.146
they all managed
to find each other again.

00:20:47.146 --> 00:20:49.849
Perhaps that was
in their fortune too.

00:20:49.849 --> 00:20:53.986
But one thing's for sure,
their journey continues!

00:20:57.656 --> 00:21:00.826
