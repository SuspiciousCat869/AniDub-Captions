Yeah, but back then,
you decided that challengers

00:00:30.497 --> 00:00:31.765
should be strong enough

00:00:31.765 --> 00:00:33.600

we found ourselves

This has gotta be Team Rocket.

00:09:11.885 --> 00:09:14.721
That's why Pikachu and the
others are acting so strangely.

00:09:14.721 --> 00:09:17.424
It's because
of the Pokémon control waves.

00:09:17.424 --> 00:09:19.426
So do you know
where they are now?

00:09:19.426 --> 00:09:21.795
They must be in
the power plant's control room.

00:09:21.795 --> 00:09:23.029
You see the control room

00:09:23.029 --> 00:09:25.165
is right next
to the superconductor ring.

00:09:25.165 --> 00:09:27.200
And I'm pretty sure
they're still there.

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:29.235
So can you tell us
how to get to them?

00:09:29.235 --> 00:09:30.837
A.C.
The route isn't complicated

00:09:30.837 --> 00:09:33.840
but they've locked every single

that's the Twerp's, do ya?

Well, if in fact it is,

You want to reverse the current?

That's right,
reversing the current

will overload the entire system

00:12:30.149 --> 00:12:33.386
and stop the flow of Pokémon

our counterattack.

00:17:42.862 --> 00:17:44.564
When Electric Terrain's
in effect

00:17:44.564 --> 00:17:48.267
Electric type attacks
get a power boost.

00:17:48.267 --> 00:17:50.303
Everybody! Let's go!

00:17:50.303 --> 00:17:51.637
[DISCHARGE MOVE]

00:17:51.637 --> 00:17:54.473
[DISCHARGE MOVE]

00:17:56.576 --> 00:17:58.277
You don't want to do that.

00:17:58.277 --> 00:18:00.446
And even if you do, don't.

00:18:05.284 --> 00:18:08.120
JESSIE/JAMES/MEOWTH
No!

00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:12.224
JESSIE/JAMES/MEOWTH
We're blasting off again!

00:18:13.259 --> 00:18:15.761
[cheering and laughing]

00:18:21.467 --> 00:18:22.735
CLEMONT
I'm truly sorry

00:18:22.735 --> 00:18:25.237
that some sections of
the power plant were destroyed.

00:18:25.237 --> 00:18:27.340
Don't be. Not a problem.

00:18:27.340 --> 00:18:29.475
Because of you,
Lumiose City is safe.

00:18:29.475 --> 00:18:31.510
We're the ones
who should apologize.

00:18:31.510 --> 00:18:34.714
We're using the subsystem
to supply power to the city

00:18:34.714 --> 00:18:36.315
so everything is fine.

00:18:36.315 --> 00:18:38.050
That's great.

00:18:38.050 --> 00:18:40.620
And I learned something else
from you, Ash.

00:18:40.620 --> 00:18:42.021
I didn't do anything.

00:18:42.021 --> 00:18:44.724
We were able to get
all of the Pokémon out of there

00:18:44.724 --> 00:18:45.725
thanks to you.

00:18:45.725 --> 00:18:48.127
He's right.
You were really amazing.

00:18:48.127 --> 00:18:50.429
Yup. You were so great

00:18:50.429 --> 00:18:52.231
[chuckles]
Well, thank you all.

00:18:52.231 --> 00:18:54.900
It's nice to know
you feel that way.

00:19:00.106 --> 00:19:03.342
I'm on my way to our
main offices in Lumiose City

00:19:03.342 --> 00:19:05.111
to brief them
on what happened today.

00:19:05.111 --> 00:19:08.214
Ah. Hm.

00:19:12.852 --> 00:19:16.288
Would it be possible if I came
along with you to Lumiose City?

00:19:16.288 --> 00:19:17.490
[all gasp]

00:19:17.490 --> 00:19:19.725
Sure. If you want.

00:19:19.725 --> 00:19:21.827
Clemont, what are you doing?

00:19:23.329 --> 00:19:25.965
I think it's time
I headed back to Lumiose City.

00:19:25.965 --> 00:19:28.100
Then we'll go along.

00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:30.302
‐ No.
‐ Huh?

00:19:30.302 --> 00:19:33.706
I'm just not satisfied
with where I am right now.

00:19:33.706 --> 00:19:37.043
I want to go home
and work hard and train

00:19:37.043 --> 00:19:40.212
before you come
to the Lumiose City Gym.

00:19:40.212 --> 00:19:42.581
'By the time you challenge
the Lumiose Gym'

00:19:42.581 --> 00:19:44.850
'I'll be ready to give you
a battle that you'd expect'

00:19:44.850 --> 00:19:46.152
'from a Gym Leader.'

00:19:46.152 --> 00:19:48.120
I see.

00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:51.123
But still, I'm not gonna lose,
no matter what.

00:19:51.123 --> 00:19:54.460
ASH/CLEMONT
Hm.

00:19:54.460 --> 00:19:56.395
Serena?

00:19:56.395 --> 00:19:57.630
'Will you look after Bonnie?'

00:19:57.630 --> 00:19:59.465
You can count on me.

00:19:59.465 --> 00:20:02.234
[sobbing] I'm not a little kid.
I'll be fine.

00:20:02.234 --> 00:20:03.602
Hm.

00:20:05.604 --> 00:20:08.207
[helicopter whirring]

00:20:12.678 --> 00:20:16.248
I'll be waiting
at the Lumiose Gym.

00:20:16.248 --> 00:20:17.383
See you soon.

00:20:17.383 --> 00:20:19.051
Don't forget,
I'm gonna beat you

00:20:19.051 --> 00:20:21.053
and win my fifth badge for sure.

00:20:21.053 --> 00:20:24.056
We'll see. Since I'm not gonna
lose either.

00:20:24.056 --> 00:20:26.726
Take care.
Can't wait for our Gym battle.

00:20:26.726 --> 00:20:29.228
[WARM]

00:20:29.228 --> 00:20:31.530
NARRATOR Because of our heroes'
bold actions

00:20:31.530 --> 00:20:34.734
the Kalos Power Plant is safely
back in the right hands.

00:20:34.734 --> 00:20:37.737
Now, Clemont is off
to Lumiose City by himself

00:20:37.737 --> 00:20:39.405
for some time to reflect

00:20:39.405 --> 00:20:42.174
while Ash eagerly looks forward
to his upcoming battle

00:20:42.174 --> 00:20:46.879
against Clemont at the Lumiose
Gym, as the journey continues.

00:20:56.922 --> 00:21:00.092
