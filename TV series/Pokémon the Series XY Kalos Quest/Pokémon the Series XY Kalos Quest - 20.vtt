I've finally managed
to obtain one of each.

[all gasps]

00:01:44.538 --> 00:01:47.007

[EVOLVING]

00:01:59.453 --> 00:02:02.522
I know each Pokémon
requires its own Mega Stone.

00:02:02.522 --> 00:02:05.158
So which Pokémon
is this Mega Stone for?

00:02:05.158 --> 00:02:07.394
An excellent question, Clemont.

00:02:07.394 --> 00:02:10.597
Today's experiment is designed
to provide us with the answer.

00:02:10.597 --> 00:02:12.566
So, if you're ready,
this synchronizer

00:02:12.566 --> 00:02:13.667
should do the trick.

00:02:13.667 --> 00:02:16.136
Now, one, two, three.

00:02:17.404 --> 00:02:19.406

First, we take our Mega Stone

00:02:22.509 --> 00:02:25.345

Can Dedenne Mega Evolve?

[AGREEMENT]

00:02:35.055 --> 00:02:37.591
Well, the fact is
Pikachu could still evolve

00:02:37.591 --> 00:02:39.593
so Mega Evolution won't work.

00:02:39.593 --> 00:02:42.162
It's possible Dedenne
could Mega Evolve.

00:02:42.162 --> 00:02:45.032

That is a Mega Stone.

‐ Professor?
‐ Huh.

00:02:57.411 --> 00:03:00.414
‐ The synchronizer is reacting.
‐ 'Really?'

00:03:00.414 --> 00:03:05.152
That means the Mega Stone
is a genuine Garchompite.

00:03:05.152 --> 00:03:07.988
That means we'll get to see
Garchomp Mega Evolve.

we want in.

Hey. I'm freezing.

00:17:42.728 --> 00:17:45.131
I feel a blastoff in our future.

00:17:45.131 --> 00:17:46.866
Then let's change it.

00:17:46.866 --> 00:17:48.534
[both grunts]

00:17:48.534 --> 00:17:51.037
There's nothing like
an emergency getaway scheme.

00:17:51.037 --> 00:17:52.672
Especially rocket‐propelled.

00:17:52.672 --> 00:17:54.974
Full speed!

00:17:54.974 --> 00:17:57.310
Oh, no. They're getting away.

00:17:57.310 --> 00:17:58.477
Not this time.

00:17:58.477 --> 00:18:00.646
That's right. Blaziken!

[AFFIRMATIVE]

00:18:01.647 --> 00:18:03.749

TEAM ROCKET
Gotta fly.

00:18:12.491 --> 00:18:13.793
Use Flamethrower!

00:18:13.793 --> 00:18:15.428
Use Hyper Beam!

00:18:15.428 --> 00:18:16.495
Use Thunderbolt!

00:18:16.495 --> 00:18:18.397

00:18:31.310 --> 00:18:32.945
TEAM ROCKET A triple‐strength
blastoff

00:18:32.945 --> 00:18:35.281
is three times the
embarrassment.

00:18:51.964 --> 00:18:53.833
You were marvelous, Garchomp.

00:18:53.833 --> 00:18:55.001
[AFFIRMATIVE]

00:18:55.001 --> 00:18:56.002

Oh, something marvelous
about motor oil. Oh.

00:19:04.644 --> 00:19:06.779
Blaziken Mask, thanks.

00:19:06.779 --> 00:19:07.980
You were a big help.

00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:10.416
‐ Both of you.
‐ Hmm.

00:19:10.416 --> 00:19:12.551

Look.

00:19:16.455 --> 00:19:17.757
Professor, how's Garchomp?

00:19:17.757 --> 00:19:20.459
SYCAMORE
It's safe and sound.

00:19:20.459 --> 00:19:22.261
Everything's been figured out.

00:19:22.261 --> 00:19:23.295
Figured out?

00:19:23.295 --> 00:19:26.098
Yeah. See, Blaziken Mask
went wham bam.

00:19:26.098 --> 00:19:27.867
‐ Now everything's fine.
‐ Where is he?

00:19:27.867 --> 00:19:29.301
‐ Huh?
‐ Huh?

BONNIE
Gone.

00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:37.677
ASH Professor Sycamore,
thank you for everything.

00:19:37.677 --> 00:19:39.311

to Laverre City.

00:19:59.265 --> 00:20:01.067
‐ Professor?
‐ Hmm?

00:20:01.067 --> 00:20:02.802
I'm afraid it happened again.

00:20:23.255 --> 00:20:26.125
there's something quite
marvelous about motor oil.

00:20:26.125 --> 00:20:29.061
I'll bet you're having
electrical problems again.

00:20:29.061 --> 00:20:31.063
Would you like me
to come over this afternoon?

00:20:31.063 --> 00:20:32.164
Not quite.

00:20:32.164 --> 00:20:35.134
I came over
about something else.

00:20:35.134 --> 00:20:36.335
Hm?

00:20:36.335 --> 00:20:37.770
What do you think?

Mega Blaziken.

00:20:39.772 --> 00:20:41.774
Would you help me
with my research

00:20:41.774 --> 00:20:44.710
with Mega Blaziken?
