I'm really sorry, Ash.

00:15:21.354 --> 00:15:25.224
But somehow, we got
separated from Goomy.

00:15:25.224 --> 00:15:27.527
‐ Huh?
‐ It's not Serena's fault!

00:15:27.527 --> 00:15:30.263
Serena battled really,
really hard against Team Rocket

00:15:30.263 --> 00:15:33.566
to protect us, and that's
about the time Goomy ran off.

I can't thank you enough!

00:15:38.271 --> 00:15:40.339
I'm guessing
Goomy ran off like that

00:15:40.339 --> 00:15:42.008
because it was really scared.

Dedenne went inside
