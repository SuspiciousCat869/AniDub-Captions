My. This is quite
an unusual decoration.

I knew if Jessie did it,
she'd mess things up.

00:08:24.671 --> 00:08:28.108
Well, the Pokémon certainly seem
to adore the flavors.

The most important thing
about Poké Puffs

00:08:30.010 --> 00:08:31.978
is that the Pokémon
truly love them.

So which performer will move on

00:10:42.876 --> 00:10:44.677
to the Freestyle Performance?

00:10:44.677 --> 00:10:47.547

00:16:49.876 --> 00:16:52.044
Everything looked amazing.

00:16:52.044 --> 00:16:54.013
[EXCITED]

00:16:54.013 --> 00:16:57.483
PIERRE 'What a spectacular sight
for our final performance.'

00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:03.189
Serena did it. Hmm.

00:17:04.223 --> 00:17:06.993
Alors.
It's the moment of truth.

00:17:06.993 --> 00:17:09.195
Who will win our exciting
Dendemille Town

00:17:09.195 --> 00:17:12.198
Pokémon Showcase this year?

00:17:12.198 --> 00:17:14.534
And who will decide?

00:17:14.534 --> 00:17:17.470
Why, it's none other than
all of you in the audience.

00:17:17.470 --> 00:17:19.138
The time has finally come.

00:17:19.138 --> 00:17:21.173
‐ Uh‐huh.
‐ Serena, please.

00:17:21.173 --> 00:17:23.876
POERRE 'Please use your glow
sticks to fire off the color'

00:17:23.876 --> 00:17:27.380
'corresponding to the performer
who you think was number one.'

00:17:27.380 --> 00:17:31.384
‐ One, two, and on three.
‐ Jessilia.

00:17:32.285 --> 00:17:34.387
[cheering]

00:17:38.724 --> 00:17:40.793
[chuckles]

00:17:42.562 --> 00:17:44.196
[chuckles]

00:17:49.402 --> 00:17:52.872
Please, please, please,
please, please.

00:18:13.859 --> 00:18:15.695
[gasps]

00:18:16.696 --> 00:18:18.331
Look at that.

00:18:18.331 --> 00:18:20.199
But, it can't be.

00:18:20.199 --> 00:18:22.368
PIERRE 'The winner of
the Dendemille Town'

00:18:22.368 --> 00:18:25.071
'Pokémon Showcase
has been decided.'

00:18:25.071 --> 00:18:26.505
'And she's..'

00:18:26.505 --> 00:18:28.507
'...performer Serena.'

00:18:28.507 --> 00:18:30.710
[cheering]

00:18:30.710 --> 00:18:32.178
Awesome.

00:18:32.178 --> 00:18:33.512
Alright. Serena.

00:18:33.512 --> 00:18:35.781
Wow, she did it.
She did it.

00:18:36.582 --> 00:18:39.585
Huh? We won.

00:18:39.585 --> 00:18:41.220
We actually won the performance.

00:18:41.220 --> 00:18:44.223
Oh, no. Poor Jessie.
For that matter, poor me.

00:18:44.223 --> 00:18:46.359
I'm the one
who should be Kalos Queen

00:18:46.359 --> 00:18:48.894
so how can so many dumb people
get it wrong?

00:18:48.894 --> 00:18:50.930
[whimpering]

00:18:50.930 --> 00:18:52.398
Hmm.

00:18:55.835 --> 00:18:58.738
And now, it's time to present
the Princess Key

00:18:58.738 --> 00:19:01.107
to our victorious performer,
Serena.

00:19:01.107 --> 00:19:02.241
Congratulations

00:19:02.241 --> 00:19:04.677
on your first Princess Key win.

00:19:04.677 --> 00:19:06.245
[FRIENDLY]

00:19:06.245 --> 00:19:08.914
Thank you so much.
This is great.

00:19:08.914 --> 00:19:10.950
[chuckles]

00:19:10.950 --> 00:19:12.885
Ta‐da. I did it.

00:19:12.885 --> 00:19:14.420
The Princess Key..

00:19:14.420 --> 00:19:15.421
‐...mine.

00:19:15.421 --> 00:19:17.256
[TRIUMPHANT]

00:19:17.256 --> 00:19:19.992
[cheering]

00:19:19.992 --> 00:19:23.195
Congratulations to Serena
for taking her first step

00:19:23.195 --> 00:19:25.731
towards becoming
our Kalos Queen.

00:19:25.731 --> 00:19:28.467
So until next time, au revoir.

00:19:28.467 --> 00:19:29.502
[chuckles]

00:19:29.502 --> 00:19:30.603
Yippee.

00:19:30.603 --> 00:19:32.438
I've got to practice even more.

00:19:32.438 --> 00:19:34.707
This is no time to get lazy.

00:19:34.707 --> 00:19:36.709
That's my daughter after all.

00:19:36.709 --> 00:19:38.044
[chuckles]

00:19:39.612 --> 00:19:42.415
BONNIE
'Oh. So you ripped your outfit?'

00:19:42.415 --> 00:19:46.485
Yeah, so that's when I came up
with the idea to cut my hem.

00:19:46.485 --> 00:19:48.054
Wow. That was really clever.

00:19:48.054 --> 00:19:49.722
Nice job up there.

00:19:49.722 --> 00:19:52.658
I'm sorry I tore the outfit
Valerie gave me.

00:19:52.658 --> 00:19:55.227
I guess I should tell her
how sorry I am.

00:19:55.227 --> 00:19:57.363
You know,
it really looked great on you.

00:19:57.363 --> 00:20:00.066
Huh? Oh, thank you, Ash.

00:20:00.066 --> 00:20:02.435
He's telling the truth,
you know.

00:20:02.435 --> 00:20:04.003
Huh? It's Miette.

00:20:04.003 --> 00:20:08.140
I may have lost today,
but I'll win the next time.

00:20:08.140 --> 00:20:11.477
I'll see you then.
You just wait.

00:20:11.477 --> 00:20:13.612
It's a deal.
You take care.

00:20:18.984 --> 00:20:20.219
[grunts]

00:20:20.219 --> 00:20:21.587
And I haven't given up

00:20:21.587 --> 00:20:23.422
on our other competition,
either.

00:20:23.422 --> 00:20:25.224
Huh?

00:20:25.224 --> 00:20:26.659
See you later, Ash.

00:20:26.659 --> 00:20:29.061
‐ Okay, Miette, take care.
‐ Huh?

00:20:29.061 --> 00:20:30.529
[chuckle]
Isn't that sweet?

00:20:30.529 --> 00:20:33.032
‐ Miette.
‐ See you.

00:20:33.032 --> 00:20:35.835
‐ Have fun.
‐ Bye‐bye.

00:20:35.835 --> 00:20:37.136
Bye.

00:20:39.171 --> 00:20:40.372
[chuckles]

00:20:40.372 --> 00:20:42.341
Hmm.

00:20:42.341 --> 00:20:45.578
NARRATOR And so, with her first
Pokémon Showcase win

00:20:45.578 --> 00:20:48.781
in Dendemille Town,
Serena's journey as a performer

00:20:48.781 --> 00:20:50.182
has just begun

00:20:50.182 --> 00:20:54.453
as the journey for all
our heroes continues.
