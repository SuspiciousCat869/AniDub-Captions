that's one less rival.

'Look at this.'

00:09:33.073 --> 00:09:36.576
'Mr. Woodward's a famous tree
surgeon and he lives close by.'

00:09:36.576 --> 00:09:39.179
'He once reattached
a Sawsbuck's horn'

00:09:39.179 --> 00:09:41.548
'which everyone said
would be impossible.'

00:09:42.449 --> 00:09:43.983
A tree surgeon?

00:09:43.983 --> 00:09:45.685
[CURIOUS]

00:09:45.685 --> 00:09:49.055
That's right. He uses a method
similar to grafting.

00:09:49.055 --> 00:09:50.223
He filed down the branch

00:09:50.223 --> 00:09:52.258
to preserve the horn's
exact dimensions

00:09:52.258 --> 00:09:54.160
and then attached it perfectly.

00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:57.530
If anyone can repair that
branch, I'd say that he can.

00:09:57.530 --> 00:10:01.201
‐ You really think so?
‐ 'It's definitely worth a try.'

Hm..

00:10:16.449 --> 00:10:17.951
Do you think you can fix it?

00:10:17.951 --> 00:10:19.285
[ANXIOUS]

00:10:19.285 --> 00:10:21.588
Because you're a skilled
wood specialist

00:10:21.588 --> 00:10:22.889
repairing this branch should be

00:10:22.889 --> 00:10:24.624
quite easy for you,
shouldn't it?

00:10:24.624 --> 00:10:26.159
Say you will, please.

00:10:27.494 --> 00:10:30.063
It's not as easy as it appears.

00:10:30.063 --> 00:10:31.064
[AGREEMENT]

00:10:31.064 --> 00:10:32.665
But you were able to reattach

00:10:32.665 --> 00:10:36.436
that Sawsbuck's horn
with skilled perfection.

00:10:36.436 --> 00:10:38.671
Yes, but that
particular procedure

00:10:38.671 --> 00:10:40.640
was successful
because the Sawsbuck

00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:43.042
had a powerful desire
to reattach its horn.

00:10:43.042 --> 00:10:45.211
But we also have
a powerful desire

00:10:45.211 --> 00:10:46.846
to get that branch repaired!

[DETERMINED

00:10:49.382 --> 00:10:51.784
You'll have to show me
that desire.

00:10:51.784 --> 00:10:55.588
That way, I'll be able to devote
a 100 percent to this procedure.

00:10:55.588 --> 00:10:57.657
But how are they
going to do that?

00:10:57.657 --> 00:11:00.360
I think the best way
is for you to consider

00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:03.563
having your Braixen
battle my Gallade.

00:11:03.563 --> 00:11:06.299
The best way by far to get
to know a Pokémon's heart

00:11:06.299 --> 00:11:08.001
is during a Pokémon battle.

Huh? It's Ash! You found me.

00:11:50.076 --> 00:11:53.179
So what happened
with Braixen's branch?

00:11:53.179 --> 00:11:54.781
You see..

00:11:58.351 --> 00:12:00.353
'And that's what happened.'

00:12:00.353 --> 00:12:04.991
Got it. So if you battle him,
he'll fix Braixen's branch.

00:12:04.991 --> 00:12:08.161
Yeah! Show them how much you
want that branch repaired!

Alright then, if you don't mind,
I'll be the referee.

00:12:14.934 --> 00:12:19.305
Trainers will each use one
Pokémon. Is a single match okay?

00:12:20.206 --> 00:12:22.342
‐ Hm.
‐ Alright.

00:12:22.342 --> 00:12:24.043
Now, Braixen, let's show them

00:12:24.043 --> 00:12:26.512
just how strongly
we feel about this.

I don't understand why they
didn't use Flamethrower.

Maybe it's difficult
to use Fire‐type moves

00:12:56.709 --> 00:12:58.444
because its branch is broken.

Braixen won't lose
because of something like that.

[SURPRISED]

00:17:33.386 --> 00:17:35.388
Hey, you know what?

00:17:35.388 --> 00:17:37.356
'I didn't become Kalos Queen'

00:17:37.356 --> 00:17:40.693
with the branch you had when
we made our promise together.

00:17:40.693 --> 00:17:42.562
'So let's make a new promise'

00:17:42.562 --> 00:17:45.698
'with the branch
Pancham wants to give you.'

00:17:47.533 --> 00:17:48.935
'It's time for us to write'

00:17:48.935 --> 00:17:51.470
'the next chapter
of our partnership.'

[DETERMINED]

00:17:57.243 --> 00:17:58.644
It's all for one.

00:17:58.644 --> 00:18:00.413
Let's do this together!

00:18:00.413 --> 00:18:03.115
[ENTHUSIASTIC]

00:18:07.086 --> 00:18:10.323
This is to remember
the promise we've made.

[DETERMINED]

00:18:18.831 --> 00:18:21.000
Now, let's get back
to our battle.

00:18:22.168 --> 00:18:25.137
Alright, then!
Let the battle resume!

00:18:25.137 --> 00:18:27.306
Okay, Gallade, use Psycho Cut!

00:18:27.306 --> 00:18:28.374
[PSYCHO CUT MOVE]

00:18:28.374 --> 00:18:29.875
Quick, Braixen, dodge it!

[EXERTION]

00:18:32.144 --> 00:18:33.679
Use Fire Blast!

00:18:33.679 --> 00:18:35.281
[FIRE BLAST MOVE]

00:18:35.281 --> 00:18:37.516

That will be all now.

00:18:47.860 --> 00:18:50.630
Excellent work.
Gallade, you were great.

00:18:50.630 --> 00:18:51.897
Braixen!

[HAPPY]

00:18:53.165 --> 00:18:54.200
We won!

[HAPPY]

00:18:56.902 --> 00:19:00.306
I'm really so happy Braixen's
feeling better again.

00:19:00.306 --> 00:19:03.943
Yeah. That Fire Blast really
showed us all how Braixen felt.

00:19:03.943 --> 00:19:05.344
Yippee yay!

00:19:05.344 --> 00:19:06.846
[EXCITED]

00:19:06.846 --> 00:19:08.581
Alright, my friend.

00:19:08.581 --> 00:19:11.517
I think it's about time
we both got back to work.

ASH 'What are you gonna do
with those?'

I thought you said that branch
wasn't fixable.

00:19:18.724 --> 00:19:20.693
Yes, I did say that.

00:19:22.228 --> 00:19:23.929
However..

00:19:23.929 --> 00:19:25.331
Huh?

00:19:31.303 --> 00:19:33.305
Just as it should be.

00:19:37.943 --> 00:19:41.614
'That branch will now begin
a brand‐new life right here.'

00:19:43.315 --> 00:19:46.919
There will come a day when it
will be useful to someone again.

And someday,
we'll come back here

00:19:51.157 --> 00:19:54.126
and tell it all
about our big success.

[SATISFIED]

00:19:56.562 --> 00:19:59.932
Remember, the promise we made
with you is still with us.

00:20:07.807 --> 00:20:10.309
We've learned so much
from you, Woodward.

00:20:10.309 --> 00:20:13.112
I can't thank you enough
for your generosity.

00:20:13.112 --> 00:20:16.882
Now, now. I haven't really done
much of anything at all.

you and your Pokémon'

'learned together,
my dear child.'

I wanna thank you anyway.

00:20:23.055 --> 00:20:24.690
I also want to.

00:20:24.690 --> 00:20:27.393
We'll be back to visit for sure.

00:20:27.393 --> 00:20:29.628
Anybody have an idea
where Jeeves went?

with the glasses?

CLEMONT
He just disappeared, didn't he?

00:20:35.267 --> 00:20:38.104
It's like he vanished
into thin air.

00:20:38.104 --> 00:20:39.271
Huh?

Braixen's broken branch

00:20:40.706 --> 00:20:42.408
and the promise
that went with it

00:20:42.408 --> 00:20:44.477
have given rise
to a new promise

00:20:44.477 --> 00:20:45.911
and a new branch.

00:20:45.911 --> 00:20:48.681
Now, Serena, Pancham
and Braixen

00:20:48.681 --> 00:20:50.916
look forward to winning
the Pokémon Showcase

00:20:50.916 --> 00:20:52.518
with renewed confidence

00:20:52.518 --> 00:20:55.521
as the journey continues.
