Professor Sycamore is scheduled
to arrive today

in order to begin research
on the sundial

It sparkles
just like a beautiful jewel.

00:03:46.993 --> 00:03:50.030
Some have called it
one of Kalos' Seven Wonders.

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:51.565
It's quite exciting.

three thousand years ago.

is known about.. Ha!

We use it to tell time

00:04:12.018 --> 00:04:14.788
because it always glows
at certain intervals!

00:04:14.788 --> 00:04:17.124

as rare can be.

00:04:17.124 --> 00:04:19.159

‐ Yes, ma'am.

00:08:16.563 --> 00:08:19.699
This has become a bad habit
of yours, Carrie.

00:08:19.699 --> 00:08:22.335
Acting on what you think
Lady Olympia's vision

00:08:22.335 --> 00:08:23.470
of the future means.

00:08:23.470 --> 00:08:25.605
'How many times
has this happened?'

00:08:25.605 --> 00:08:28.508
Right. I'm so sorry
for everything.

00:08:28.508 --> 00:08:29.542
Excuse us.

00:08:29.542 --> 00:08:31.745
We have no idea
what's going on.

00:08:31.745 --> 00:08:33.146
‐ Oh my!
‐ Huh?

00:08:33.146 --> 00:08:34.614
You're Olympia!

00:08:34.614 --> 00:08:37.350
'Gym Leader of the Anistar Gym.'

00:08:37.350 --> 00:08:38.718
Gym Leader?

00:08:42.722 --> 00:08:44.357
Indeed, I am.

Who's that Pokémon?

00:08:54.034 --> 00:08:56.169
It's Sableye!

00:09:08.114 --> 00:09:09.983
My name is Charlene.

00:09:09.983 --> 00:09:12.719
I am Lady Olympia's apprentice.

00:09:12.719 --> 00:09:15.555
Professor Sycamore, children

00:09:15.555 --> 00:09:19.092
please forgive my other
apprentice for her rude actions.

00:09:19.893 --> 00:09:22.796
Now, Carrie, apologize to them.

00:09:22.796 --> 00:09:24.931
I'm so very sorry.

00:09:24.931 --> 00:09:28.134
Well, I'm glad we were able
to clear that up.

00:09:28.134 --> 00:09:30.236
What was this "future"
you referred to?

00:09:30.236 --> 00:09:32.205
We saw a vision of it.

00:09:32.205 --> 00:09:35.108
I saw
disaster approaching soon.

00:09:35.108 --> 00:09:37.877
And your fates are all connected
to that threat.

00:09:38.912 --> 00:09:40.914
Carrie thought
you were enemies of Kalos

00:09:40.914 --> 00:09:43.116
based on
Lady Olympia's premonition.

00:09:43.116 --> 00:09:44.784
Enemies?

00:09:44.784 --> 00:09:46.019

There it is.

00:09:53.126 --> 00:09:54.227
I see it!

00:09:54.227 --> 00:09:55.762
What? What's going on?

00:09:55.762 --> 00:09:57.964
What did you just see,
Lady Olympia?

00:09:58.665 --> 00:10:01.034
Your future.

00:10:01.034 --> 00:10:03.203
You mean Frogadier?

00:10:03.203 --> 00:10:05.105
We'll discuss this at the Gym.

00:10:05.105 --> 00:10:06.172
Huh?

00:10:06.172 --> 00:10:07.440
[SURPRISED]

00:10:15.081 --> 00:10:17.183
‐ Whoa!
‐ It's beautiful.

00:10:17.183 --> 00:10:19.252
‐ And full of mysticism!
‐ Wow!

00:10:19.252 --> 00:10:22.155
I'd really like to know how she
can see the future like that.

00:10:22.155 --> 00:10:24.190
I want her to see
my future as well!

00:10:24.190 --> 00:10:25.458
I do, too!

00:10:25.458 --> 00:10:27.927
Like, if I ever become
a Pokémon Trainer someday

00:10:27.927 --> 00:10:30.330
and who will take care
of my big brother.

00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:32.866
[grunts] My future
is none of your business!

00:10:32.866 --> 00:10:35.702
I'm afraid
it's not quite that easy.

00:10:35.702 --> 00:10:38.438
It's the voice of the stars
that guides Lady Olympia

00:10:38.438 --> 00:10:40.707
to perceive the future.

00:10:40.707 --> 00:10:43.243
That's what happened
in the Seas of Hoenn.

00:10:43.243 --> 00:10:46.212
CHARLENE Yes, led by the voice
of the stars

00:10:46.212 --> 00:10:50.049
Lady Olympia foresaw the clash
between Groudon and Kyogre.

00:10:56.189 --> 00:10:59.092
The world saw incidents
of extreme weather

00:10:59.092 --> 00:11:00.960
but Kalos was prepared.

00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:02.762
Thanks to Olympia's vision

00:11:02.762 --> 00:11:06.199
Kalos escaped these incidents
largely unharmed.

00:11:08.368 --> 00:11:11.104
Could we be connected
to something on as large a scale

00:11:11.104 --> 00:11:12.472
as the threat you perceived?

00:11:12.472 --> 00:11:15.275
That is something
we must figure out.

00:11:15.275 --> 00:11:18.978
ASH Wow. A Gym Leader
who can see the future.

00:11:18.978 --> 00:11:20.346
Please tell me, Charlene.

00:11:20.346 --> 00:11:22.982
Are these really the ones
who will bring danger to Kalos?

00:11:22.982 --> 00:11:25.518
Your training has been
quite inadequate.

00:11:25.518 --> 00:11:28.454
Lady Olympia never said
they would bring danger to us.

00:11:28.454 --> 00:11:29.522
Oh!

00:11:29.522 --> 00:11:30.857
CHARLENE
'She said they would be trapped'

00:11:30.857 --> 00:11:32.825
'within the vortex
of this threat.'

LADY OLYMPIA
'Young man..'

00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:35.562
Huh?

00:11:35.562 --> 00:11:38.064
...it appears the vision
that I perceived earlier

00:11:38.064 --> 00:11:41.167
concerns the future of you
and your Frogadier.

00:11:41.167 --> 00:11:42.702
Me and Frogadier?

00:11:49.609 --> 00:11:51.411
That is correct.

00:11:51.411 --> 00:11:53.279
The vision that occurred
showed me

00:11:53.279 --> 00:11:56.449
your Frogadier is a Pokémon
with a curious fate.

00:11:56.449 --> 00:11:59.319
'That is clear from seeing
its past and future.'

00:12:00.253 --> 00:12:01.688
"Curious fate?"

00:12:01.688 --> 00:12:02.755
What does she mean?

00:12:02.755 --> 00:12:03.990
[CONFUSED]

00:12:05.892 --> 00:12:07.060
Frogadier

00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:09.395
a Pokémon like no other.

00:12:09.395 --> 00:12:10.997
"No other?"

00:12:10.997 --> 00:12:12.198
What's that about?

00:12:12.198 --> 00:12:13.666
[CONFUSED]

00:12:13.666 --> 00:12:16.736
If I may, let me
show you what I saw.

00:12:23.743 --> 00:12:26.246
‐ Oh, man!
‐ That's a Pokémon Egg!

00:12:26.246 --> 00:12:28.781
It is true,
to learn about the future

00:12:28.781 --> 00:12:31.117
we must first
search the past.

00:12:31.117 --> 00:12:33.753
'This is a Froakie Egg.'

00:12:33.753 --> 00:12:36.723
Do you know anything about
Frogadier's past, professor?

00:12:36.723 --> 00:12:39.092
No, I'm afraid I don't.

00:12:39.092 --> 00:12:41.294
I honestly don't know
a single thing about it

00:12:41.294 --> 00:12:44.197
before it came to me
as a Pokémon for new Trainers.

00:12:48.067 --> 00:12:50.303
[gasps]

soon after

00:13:02.181 --> 00:13:04.384
it hatched from its
Egg.

Lady Olympia Instead of playing
with the others

00:13:27.173 --> 00:13:29.976
this Froakie
trained tirelessly

00:13:29.976 --> 00:13:32.211
reaching for new heights.

00:13:33.546 --> 00:13:35.548
[SURPRISED]

00:13:35.548 --> 00:13:37.016
[HAPPY]

00:13:37.016 --> 00:13:38.318
[CONTENT]

00:13:38.318 --> 00:13:40.219
[NEGATIVE]

00:13:40.219 --> 00:13:43.723
Lady Olympia However, because
your Froakie spent so much time

00:13:43.723 --> 00:13:47.627
alone there was a lot of
conflict with others.

00:13:50.697 --> 00:13:52.932
'Then one day,
someone showed it'

00:13:52.932 --> 00:13:57.370
'that Pokémon can't become
strong all by themselves.'

00:13:57.370 --> 00:13:59.038
Froakie learned
that its strength

00:13:59.038 --> 00:14:01.274
would only be able
to reach new heights

00:14:01.274 --> 00:14:03.242
by working with a Trainer.

00:14:04.610 --> 00:14:07.880
But it wasn't just words
that made a difference.

00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:10.483
What changed Froakie
was the kindness

00:14:10.483 --> 00:14:12.251
this person showed it.

00:14:20.993 --> 00:14:25.198
So, instead of being chosen
by a Trainer

00:14:25.198 --> 00:14:28.701
this Froakie learned
how to choose its Trainer.

00:14:28.701 --> 00:14:31.270
It had one objective.

00:14:31.270 --> 00:14:33.439
To see if it was
worth devoting

00:14:33.439 --> 00:14:35.308
its life to that Trainer.

00:14:36.743 --> 00:14:38.244
From the beginning

00:14:38.244 --> 00:14:41.547
Froakie expected a high
standard from its Trainer.

00:14:41.547 --> 00:14:45.485
But somehow, it always felt
something lacking.

00:14:49.922 --> 00:14:51.758
When you're a new Trainer

00:14:51.758 --> 00:14:54.660
not everything goes as smoothly
as you would like.

00:14:54.660 --> 00:14:56.562
And everyone hesitates

00:14:56.562 --> 00:14:59.565
when experiencing something new.

00:14:59.565 --> 00:15:02.435
However, what this Froakie
was yearning for

00:15:02.435 --> 00:15:04.704
was something much deeper.

00:15:04.704 --> 00:15:07.440
I have a word for that.

00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:08.808
That word is love.

00:15:08.808 --> 00:15:10.209
Huh?

00:15:10.209 --> 00:15:11.644

Olympia, can you tell us
what Frogadier's future is?

00:16:06.232 --> 00:16:09.635
Its power will become
greater and greater.

00:16:09.635 --> 00:16:12.271
Does that mean Frogadier
will become a Greninja?

00:16:12.271 --> 00:16:15.274
Hmm. That I don't know.

00:16:15.274 --> 00:16:17.710
However, I do know this.

00:16:17.710 --> 00:16:19.345
'It will reach new heights'

00:16:19.345 --> 00:16:21.781
'that no one
has ever seen before.'

00:16:21.781 --> 00:16:25.985
And the two of you will reach
those new heights together.

00:16:25.985 --> 00:16:27.887
Could you mean Mega Evolution?

00:16:27.887 --> 00:16:29.188
"Mega Evolution?"

00:16:29.188 --> 00:16:31.190
Though no one
has yet seen a Greninja

00:16:31.190 --> 00:16:32.825
that could Mega Evolve.

A new power that no one
has ever seen before

00:16:37.697 --> 00:16:39.065
is a really big deal!

00:16:39.065 --> 00:16:41.534
Not just a big deal,
it's a huge deal!

00:16:41.534 --> 00:16:43.503

for that to happen.

The sundial is in grave danger.

00:17:14.333 --> 00:17:15.701
The sundial?

00:17:15.701 --> 00:17:16.736
[WORRIED]

00:17:16.736 --> 00:17:18.604

[HELPING HAND MOVE]

00:17:31.050 --> 00:17:33.686
That's it! Future Sight!

00:17:34.754 --> 00:17:37.857
[FUTURE SIGHT MOVE]

00:17:39.058 --> 00:17:40.426
What was that?

00:17:40.426 --> 00:17:42.228
Future Sight is a move
that takes time

00:17:42.228 --> 00:17:43.896
from when the Pokémon uses it

00:17:43.896 --> 00:17:45.665
until the attack
takes effect.

00:17:45.665 --> 00:17:48.301
What does she mean
"the sundial's in danger?"

00:17:48.301 --> 00:17:50.269
I saw the vision, too.

00:17:50.269 --> 00:17:53.105
Greedy evildoers
are going after the sundial.

00:17:54.073 --> 00:17:56.442
Of course,
Olympia used Future Sight

00:17:56.442 --> 00:17:58.511
because she saw it happening
in the future.

00:17:58.511 --> 00:18:00.146
Come on, let's move!

00:18:00.146 --> 00:18:01.547
Right!

00:18:03.950 --> 00:18:06.218
Lady Olympia!

00:18:06.218 --> 00:18:08.888
The evil ones
who are after the sundial

00:18:08.888 --> 00:18:11.257
will also play a key role

00:18:11.257 --> 00:18:13.926
in the ring of fate
that threatens Kalos.

‐ No way.

00:18:28.641 --> 00:18:29.976
They want to steal that?

00:18:29.976 --> 00:18:33.379
That means Olympia saw
Team Rocket in her vision.

00:18:33.379 --> 00:18:34.647

Oh, give it a rest!

00:18:57.203 --> 00:19:00.272
Say, maybe we should tell you
dopes to go jump in a lake!

00:19:00.272 --> 00:19:02.742
That's not a bad idea.
They just might.

That's right.

00:19:31.704 --> 00:19:34.073
That Future Sight
from before just hit.

00:19:35.775 --> 00:19:38.511
We haven't stolen
anything yet!

00:19:38.511 --> 00:19:41.580
This doesn't help
our reputation one whit!

00:19:41.580 --> 00:19:44.316
First chance I get
I'm going to file a complaint!

00:19:44.316 --> 00:19:47.553

I'm coming back!

But we're blasting off for now!

00:19:56.796 --> 00:20:00.466
Olympia's Future Sight
is truly terrifyingly accurate.

00:20:00.466 --> 00:20:01.934
Never saw that before.

00:20:01.934 --> 00:20:03.703
It's not something
a person could use

00:20:03.703 --> 00:20:05.805
unless you're able to see
the future.

when you challenge me.

who specializes
in Psychic‐type Pokémon

00:20:41.107 --> 00:20:43.476
and can also see
into the future!
