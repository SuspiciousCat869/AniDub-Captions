not too long ago.

00:03:37.217 --> 00:03:38.785

Glad to meet you.

00:03:53.166 --> 00:03:56.236
So if you're challenging Gyms,
how many badges do you have?

00:03:56.236 --> 00:03:57.637
So far, one.

00:03:57.637 --> 00:04:00.207
I really wanna get some more
battling under my belt.

00:04:00.207 --> 00:04:02.242
So you've done well since then.

00:04:02.242 --> 00:04:05.746
His Treecko's quite a unique
Pokémon and moves really well.

a lot of work to do.

00:04:14.321 --> 00:04:16.022
I really wanna get stronger

00:04:16.022 --> 00:04:19.226

the Lumiose City Gym again.

‐ You'd be welcome anytime.
‐ Thanks.

00:04:22.095 --> 00:04:24.297
But what are you doing here now,
Clemont?

00:04:24.297 --> 00:04:27.000
I left the Gym
in my Clembot's able hands.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.337
That's because I decided to
continue my journey with Ash.

00:04:30.337 --> 00:04:31.772
Hmm?

00:04:31.772 --> 00:04:33.406

I can get the chance to gain

00:04:33.406 --> 00:04:35.876

watching Ash battle.

00:04:35.876 --> 00:04:38.812
Uh‐huh.
Ash is really incredible.

‐ Really? You did?

00:04:41.381 --> 00:04:43.350
And he's got five whole badges.

Five badges? Amazing.

00:04:45.452 --> 00:04:48.655
I'm gonna do my very best
so I can catch up.

00:04:48.655 --> 00:04:52.058
Uh, I've still got a way to go.

00:04:52.058 --> 00:04:55.228
Guess my sixth gym badge will
have to wait until tomorrow.

00:04:55.228 --> 00:04:56.897

00:15:05.138 --> 00:15:08.641
Also, all of my creations
are carefully designed to look

00:15:08.641 --> 00:15:11.677
their absolute best,
when worn during battle.

00:15:11.677 --> 00:15:12.845
What did she just say?

00:15:12.845 --> 00:15:15.581
‐ 'It's finally starting.'
‐ Huh?

00:15:21.287 --> 00:15:22.388
Huh?

00:15:24.056 --> 00:15:26.492
That one, the boy in the front.

00:15:27.794 --> 00:15:31.264
‐ You with the orange tie.
‐ Uh, orange tie?

00:15:31.264 --> 00:15:33.533
‐ You want me?
‐ Yes.

00:15:33.533 --> 00:15:36.436
‐ Will you please come this way?
‐ Huh?

00:15:37.170 --> 00:15:38.171
Sawyer?

00:15:38.171 --> 00:15:39.439
[WORRIED]

00:15:43.342 --> 00:15:46.412
Uh, so what's this about?

00:15:47.747 --> 00:15:50.349
I would like to have a battle
with you right here.

00:15:50.349 --> 00:15:51.851
Here?

00:15:51.851 --> 00:15:54.454
Now, of course if it turns out
that you defeat me

00:15:54.454 --> 00:15:56.756
I'll gladly reward you
with a Gym badge.

00:15:56.756 --> 00:15:58.791
‐ Really?
‐ Huh?

00:15:58.791 --> 00:16:00.660
It's her custom.

00:16:00.660 --> 00:16:03.362
Valerie does this to demonstrate
how her creations

00:16:03.362 --> 00:16:05.832
always look their best
when worn in battle.

00:16:05.832 --> 00:16:07.433
This is my chance.

00:16:07.433 --> 00:16:08.568
I'll take everything
I've learned

00:16:08.568 --> 00:16:10.703
and win that badge for sure.

00:16:13.039 --> 00:16:16.476
And now, the battle between
Laverre Gym Leader, Valerie

00:16:16.476 --> 00:16:19.345
and Sawyer, the challenger
will now get under way.

00:16:19.345 --> 00:16:21.047
I'm ready to go.

00:16:21.047 --> 00:16:23.149
This is a one‐on‐one battle.

00:16:23.149 --> 00:16:25.318
It will be over,
when either side's Pokémon

00:16:25.318 --> 00:16:27.520
is unable to continue.

00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:29.155
‐ Hey, Ash.
‐ Serena.

00:16:29.155 --> 00:16:31.390
Sawyer is going to battle
with Valerie.

00:16:31.390 --> 00:16:33.860
Using the same rules
as a Gym battle.

00:16:33.860 --> 00:16:35.928
Sawyer can do it for sure.

00:16:35.928 --> 00:16:37.430
Now, Bagon, let's go.

00:16:37.430 --> 00:16:38.664
[DETERMINED]

00:16:38.664 --> 00:16:41.467
I wonder what Pokémon
Valerie's gonna use?

00:16:43.402 --> 00:16:44.637
Spritzee..

00:16:46.205 --> 00:16:47.573
...come out.

00:16:49.542 --> 00:16:50.743
[APPEARING]

00:16:50.743 --> 00:16:52.612
I think I know that.

00:16:55.248 --> 00:16:57.483
POKEDEX
Spritzee. The Perfume Pokémon.

00:16:57.483 --> 00:16:59.785
Spritzee gives off a fragrance
that delights anyone

00:16:59.785 --> 00:17:01.420
who smells it,
which changes depending on

00:17:01.420 --> 00:17:03.289
what Spritzee eats.

00:17:03.289 --> 00:17:05.658
‐ This could be very bad.
‐ Huh?

00:17:05.658 --> 00:17:06.926
What do you mean bad?

00:17:09.395 --> 00:17:11.264
Bagon, use Dragon Breath.

00:17:11.264 --> 00:17:13.900
[DRAGON BREATH MOVE]

00:17:14.967 --> 00:17:17.670
Yeah. I landed the first attack.

00:17:17.670 --> 00:17:18.938
Huh?

00:17:18.938 --> 00:17:20.640
[HAPPY]

00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:22.208
How can it be?

00:17:22.208 --> 00:17:24.243
SAWYER
'I'm sure it made contact.'

00:17:24.243 --> 00:17:25.545
[HAPPY]

00:17:26.445 --> 00:17:27.880
[chuckles]

00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:30.383
Ah, you see,
Spritzee is a Fairy type.

00:17:30.383 --> 00:17:34.387
And Dragon‐type moves have
no effect at all on Fairy types.

00:17:34.387 --> 00:17:35.621
That's right.

00:17:35.621 --> 00:17:37.790
So that means
Bagon is in big trouble.

00:17:37.790 --> 00:17:40.660
This is going to be
one tough battle.

00:17:40.660 --> 00:17:44.530
Let's see. Dragon‐type moves
don't work on a Fairy type.

00:17:44.530 --> 00:17:46.966
I'll be sure to make a note
of this experience.

00:17:46.966 --> 00:17:49.735
‐ 'Look at Ms. Valerie.'
‐ 'So beautiful.'

00:17:49.735 --> 00:17:52.905
It's not enough.
Not enough yet.

00:17:52.905 --> 00:17:55.408
Not enough for my beautiful
battle.

00:17:55.408 --> 00:17:57.843
Now, try this. Headbutt.

00:17:57.843 --> 00:17:59.612
[HEADBUTT MOVE]

00:17:59.612 --> 00:18:02.248
And this. A continuous Headbutt.

00:18:02.248 --> 00:18:05.084
[HEADBUT MOVE]

00:18:07.987 --> 00:18:10.089
Spritzee never wastes
any movement.

00:18:10.089 --> 00:18:11.190
But how?

00:18:11.190 --> 00:18:13.759
It dodged every single one
of them.

00:18:13.759 --> 00:18:16.696
Now, I think that it's our
turn..

00:18:19.131 --> 00:18:21.867
...to make this battle
beautiful.

00:18:22.668 --> 00:18:24.236
Spritzee. Let's go.

00:18:24.236 --> 00:18:26.105
[DETERMINED]

00:18:26.105 --> 00:18:27.440
Don't let it get away.

00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:29.508
‐ Headbutt.
‐ Alright.

00:18:29.508 --> 00:18:31.210
Dazzling Gleam.

00:18:31.210 --> 00:18:33.546
[DAZZLING GLEAM MOVE]

00:18:33.546 --> 00:18:36.649
[crowd cheering]

00:18:38.517 --> 00:18:39.619
[gasps]

00:18:40.486 --> 00:18:41.654
[whimpers]

00:18:41.654 --> 00:18:42.788
[PAINED]

00:18:42.788 --> 00:18:44.123
Bagon, no.

00:18:44.123 --> 00:18:46.158
KALI
'Bagon is unable to battle.'

00:18:46.158 --> 00:18:49.128
The match goes to Gym Leader
Valerie.

00:18:49.128 --> 00:18:52.231
[crowd cheering]

00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:57.003
Bagon, you battled really hard.

00:18:58.704 --> 00:19:00.406
[groans]

00:19:00.406 --> 00:19:01.507
Hmm?

00:19:04.543 --> 00:19:06.178
Thank you.

00:19:06.946 --> 00:19:08.247
Hmm.

00:19:08.247 --> 00:19:09.949
Thank you very much.

00:19:09.949 --> 00:19:13.052
[crowd cheering]

00:19:22.928 --> 00:19:24.830
[crowd cheering]

00:19:24.830 --> 00:19:26.532
[chuckles]

00:19:29.068 --> 00:19:31.537
So that's the Gym Leader
I have to face.

00:19:31.537 --> 00:19:33.205
I've got it.

00:19:39.078 --> 00:19:41.213
SAWYER
'I learned so much today.'

00:19:41.213 --> 00:19:43.716
I would challenge her again
for sure.

00:19:43.716 --> 00:19:46.886
‐ That's the spirit.
‐ Good luck, Sawyer.

00:19:46.886 --> 00:19:49.355
‐ Man, that was good.
‐ Huh?

00:19:49.355 --> 00:19:52.024
Alright.
Time for some special training.

00:19:52.024 --> 00:19:53.592
Ash?

00:19:53.592 --> 00:19:56.095
I wanna be ready for my Gym
battle with Valerie.

00:19:56.095 --> 00:19:59.331
And that's gonna be really soon.
Let's go.

00:19:59.331 --> 00:20:02.034
[RAVENOUS]/[DETERMINED]

00:20:02.034 --> 00:20:04.637
Hey, Ash? May I join in too?

00:20:04.637 --> 00:20:06.539
You bet. That'd be great.

00:20:06.539 --> 00:20:08.574
You could really help us out
a lot.

00:20:08.574 --> 00:20:10.643
Ah. Thanks.

00:20:11.544 --> 00:20:13.379
Hey, what's the rush?

00:20:13.379 --> 00:20:16.382
It wouldn't hurt to take
the time for a proper meal.

00:20:16.382 --> 00:20:18.718
Ash has trouble relaxing
when he knows

00:20:18.718 --> 00:20:20.886
there's a strong opponent
waiting for him.

00:20:20.886 --> 00:20:21.987
Hmm.

00:20:22.588 --> 00:20:24.590
[chomping]

00:20:24.590 --> 00:20:26.292
Huh?

00:20:26.292 --> 00:20:28.461
Well, if that's the case,
I'll cheer them on.

00:20:28.461 --> 00:20:30.196
Okay, I'm coming.

00:20:31.130 --> 00:20:33.332
‐ Wait up.
‐ What, you, too?

00:20:33.332 --> 00:20:35.367
Guess I'll go, too.

00:20:35.367 --> 00:20:37.737
[chomping]

00:20:37.737 --> 00:20:39.505
Hey, wait for me.

00:20:39.505 --> 00:20:42.041
NARRATOR Now that Ash has
witnessed the incredible power

00:20:42.041 --> 00:20:45.311
of Valerie the Laverre City Gym
Leader, will he be able

00:20:45.311 --> 00:20:48.247
to defeat her and earn his
sixth Kalos Gym badge?

00:20:48.247 --> 00:20:49.815
The answer to come

00:20:49.815 --> 00:20:52.418
as the journey continues.
