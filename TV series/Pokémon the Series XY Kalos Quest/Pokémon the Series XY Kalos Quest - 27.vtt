to win a Gym badge!

And here he is.
The Champion, Steven Stone!

Working with his partner,
Metagross

00:03:48.195 --> 00:03:50.330
Steven's the strongest
of all Trainers

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:51.765
in the Hoenn region.

00:03:51.765 --> 00:03:54.968

he's also heir

Hoenn's largest company!

So that means
Champion Butterfingers

where, where, where?

Finding this
was a stroke of luck.

‐ Hey, do you know them?
‐ Afraid so.

Don't act so Twerpish.

It's signed
by the Champion himself.

And you can be sure
the two of us

00:09:19.726 --> 00:09:21.895

[EXCITED]

00:17:17.003 --> 00:17:18.371
Uh..

00:17:18.371 --> 00:17:21.841

[EXCITED]

00:17:32.118 --> 00:17:34.086
ASH That just happened
because Grovyle

00:17:34.086 --> 00:17:36.022
could sense your passion!

00:17:36.022 --> 00:17:38.090
My passion, huh?

00:17:38.090 --> 00:17:40.793
[chuckles]
Grovyle, you ready?

00:17:40.793 --> 00:17:42.361
