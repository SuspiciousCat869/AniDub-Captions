We will. And there's proof.

00:08:44.758 --> 00:08:46.559
I'd say those are
Twerpish footprints.

00:08:46.559 --> 00:08:48.094

We could fly. Of course
we don't know how. Right?

to work with right now.

'Saizo?'

Hey, what's going on?

00:19:02.375 --> 00:19:03.876
There's nothing written on it.

No way, master.
What's this all about?

00:19:07.613 --> 00:19:11.017
‐ I was testing you.
‐ Testing me?

00:19:11.017 --> 00:19:13.853
You are a ninja
who went on a training journey.

00:19:13.853 --> 00:19:16.088
So I thought
I should give you a test.

00:19:16.088 --> 00:19:18.524
To see just
how much you've grown.

00:19:18.524 --> 00:19:21.227
Saizo didn't want us to get in
the middle of any trouble

00:19:21.227 --> 00:19:23.195
that might have put
us in harm's way.

So he brought us
over here to the manor.

able to find you and Pikachu.

with my very own eyes.

Oh, I wanted to see that,
I know.

You can go back
to being Froakie.

you evolve too.

‐ You wanna have a battle?
‐ This time I'll win.
