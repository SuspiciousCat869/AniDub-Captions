You're wasting
your fancy footwork.

That's far enough.

Check out this fancy footwork.

00:17:48.134 --> 00:17:50.836
Actually, air travel
doesn't use feet.

I'd say when Eevee gets
in front of others

00:19:33.005 --> 00:19:35.474
it feels just a little bit shy.

00:19:35.474 --> 00:19:37.309
Now don't you worry, Eevee.
