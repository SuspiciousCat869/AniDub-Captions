'Thank you so much, Olympia!'

00:17:06.893 --> 00:17:09.028
LADY OLYMPIA 'Young man,
during our battle'

00:17:09.028 --> 00:17:11.330
'you truly were one
with your Pokémon.'

00:17:11.330 --> 00:17:13.566
And I could sense those
strong bonds

00:17:13.566 --> 00:17:15.401
with all your Pokémon.

00:17:15.401 --> 00:17:19.272
That's love.
The true power of love!

00:17:19.272 --> 00:17:23.175
You battled very well,
Frogadier and Talonflame

00:17:23.175 --> 00:17:25.177
and you too, Pikachu.

00:17:26.345 --> 00:17:27.547
Pikachu?

00:17:27.547 --> 00:17:29.282
Pikachu was timing exactly

00:17:29.282 --> 00:17:31.384
when the Future Sight attacks
would go off.

00:17:31.384 --> 00:17:32.685
[AFFIRMATIVE]

00:17:32.685 --> 00:17:33.719
Yeah?

00:17:33.719 --> 00:17:35.187
Wow, that's what it was.

00:17:35.187 --> 00:17:37.490
A true victory for teamwork.

00:17:37.490 --> 00:17:39.425
So, Olympia,
during the battle

00:17:39.425 --> 00:17:42.461
were you able to decipher
any of Frogadier's future?

00:17:42.461 --> 00:17:46.666
Um, yes, I perceived great love
during its final move.

00:17:46.666 --> 00:17:49.402
I believe you and Frogadier
will achieve

00:17:49.402 --> 00:17:51.704
even greater heights together.

00:17:51.704 --> 00:17:53.472
[SHOCKED]

00:17:53.472 --> 00:17:55.308
One thing about this love!

00:17:55.308 --> 00:17:58.678
If the two of you do not go
forward with sincere purpose

00:17:58.678 --> 00:18:01.047
then great danger
awaits you both.

00:18:04.517 --> 00:18:07.420
So, please,
do not lose sight of your dream.

00:18:07.420 --> 00:18:09.522
Right!

00:18:09.522 --> 00:18:13.125
And now, proof of your victory
at the Anistar Gym.

00:18:17.730 --> 00:18:19.498
It's the Psychic Badge.

00:18:19.498 --> 00:18:20.833
[EXCITED]

00:18:22.168 --> 00:18:25.371
Alright.
I got the Psychic Badge!

00:18:25.371 --> 00:18:27.740
PIKACHU/TALONFLAME
[EXCITED]

00:18:27.740 --> 00:18:29.275
Congratulations, Ash!

00:18:29.275 --> 00:18:31.510
One more badge
until the Kalos League!

00:18:31.510 --> 00:18:34.146
‐ You've come such a long way!
‐ You have.

00:18:34.146 --> 00:18:35.948
Both you and your Pokémon.

00:18:35.948 --> 00:18:38.384
'Truly marvelous!'

00:18:38.384 --> 00:18:39.819
I'm impressed!

00:18:42.888 --> 00:18:46.392
I've wanted to ask you something
all this time.

00:18:46.392 --> 00:18:49.228
The danger you were
seeing around Kalos

00:18:49.228 --> 00:18:50.863
what exactly was it?

00:18:51.530 --> 00:18:53.199
Green fire.

00:18:54.133 --> 00:18:56.202
A flickering green flame.

00:18:56.202 --> 00:18:59.472
I saw it engulf Kalos
and threaten to consume

00:18:59.472 --> 00:19:01.073
all of the people
and Pokémon

00:19:01.073 --> 00:19:02.975
in that swirling fire.

00:19:03.976 --> 00:19:06.078
You will all play
a substantial role

00:19:06.078 --> 00:19:08.414
in the chaos and turmoil.

00:19:08.414 --> 00:19:09.815
And every one of the villains

00:19:09.815 --> 00:19:11.584
who tried to steal the sundial.

00:19:11.584 --> 00:19:13.786
You mean, Team Rocket?

00:19:13.786 --> 00:19:16.288
LADY OLYMPIA What role you play
is up to you.

00:19:16.288 --> 00:19:18.190
Be sure to take good care.

00:19:18.190 --> 00:19:21.594
The great whirlwind
threatens to engulf you all.

00:19:21.594 --> 00:19:23.829
[screaming]

00:19:23.829 --> 00:19:25.831
Is this a cold?

00:19:25.831 --> 00:19:29.902
[sighs]
Hmm, I don't have a fever.

00:19:29.902 --> 00:19:32.271
MEOWTH Maybe some yahoo's
yapping about us.

00:19:34.874 --> 00:19:37.343
ASH 'Professor, thanks
for cheering us on!'

00:19:37.343 --> 00:19:38.411
PIKACHU
[AFFIRMATIVE]

00:19:38.411 --> 00:19:40.012
I should thank you.

00:19:40.012 --> 00:19:42.415
It was a truly marvelous battle
to behold.

00:19:42.415 --> 00:19:45.751
And for that, here's the most
recently updated Pokédex.

00:19:45.751 --> 00:19:47.319
'One for Serena, too.'

00:19:50.289 --> 00:19:51.857
Thank you very much!

00:19:51.857 --> 00:19:54.927
‐ I'm jealous!
‐ Maybe when you're a bit older.

00:19:56.529 --> 00:19:58.230
Those units also contain

00:19:58.230 --> 00:20:01.600
all of our current research
on Mega Evolution.

00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:04.036
I hope it helps you
on future adventures!

00:20:04.036 --> 00:20:05.371
Thanks!

00:20:05.371 --> 00:20:06.672
Have you decided
where you'll go

00:20:06.672 --> 00:20:08.874
for your final Gym battle?

00:20:08.874 --> 00:20:10.543
No, I haven't thought about it.

00:20:10.543 --> 00:20:12.978
Let's see
where the nearest Gym is.

00:20:12.978 --> 00:20:15.014
'Ta‐da! Here!'

00:20:15.681 --> 00:20:17.016
Snowbelle City.

00:20:17.016 --> 00:20:19.518
Great! That's where we'll go!

00:20:19.518 --> 00:20:21.253
[EXCITED]

00:20:21.253 --> 00:20:22.688
NARRATOR
Following a tough battle

00:20:22.688 --> 00:20:24.423
at the Anistar City Gym

00:20:24.423 --> 00:20:26.025
Ash finally managed to win

00:20:26.025 --> 00:20:28.094
his seventh Kalos Gym badge!

00:20:28.094 --> 00:20:31.697
Now, what does the future
that Olympia predicted hold?

00:20:31.697 --> 00:20:33.566
What dangers await?

00:20:33.566 --> 00:20:34.967
The answers..

00:20:38.037 --> 00:20:40.172
LADY OLYMPIA
Deep green eyes..

00:20:42.475 --> 00:20:44.977
What is this
you're trying to tell me?

00:20:45.644 --> 00:20:47.079
[gasps]

00:20:50.483 --> 00:20:53.152
NARRATOR
...as the journey continues!
