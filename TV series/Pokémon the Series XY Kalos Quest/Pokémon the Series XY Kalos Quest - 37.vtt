A volcano?

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:14.715

could be one?

Hey, do you hear that noise?

00:00:27.227 --> 00:00:28.829
Could it be a Pokémon?

[FLAMETHROWER MOVE]

in such an awful mood?

And it's like that,
no matter what I do!

00:02:05.926 --> 00:02:08.295
Maybe Charmeleon wants to have
a Pokémon battle.

00:02:08.295 --> 00:02:09.429
Yeah?

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:11.331

A good battle oughta be
just the thing

00:02:21.341 --> 00:02:23.610
to calm Charmeleon
right down.

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.278
Thank you so much, Ash.

00:02:25.278 --> 00:02:27.080

We had a really great time.

Charmeleon evolved
from Charmander

but its personality
hasn't changed a bit.

00:04:27.601 --> 00:04:30.403
Charmeleon's been unbelievable
in Gym battles

00:04:30.403 --> 00:04:33.974
and thanks to all of its hard
work, I even earned a Bug Badge.

you beat Viola.

Articuno, Zapdos and Moltres.

00:05:10.777 --> 00:05:14.114
They're Pokémon whose existence
has already been confirmed

00:05:14.114 --> 00:05:16.416
but who appear to be
extraordinarily difficult

00:05:16.416 --> 00:05:17.918
to track down.

00:05:17.918 --> 00:05:20.987
I wanna meet Moltres too!

An examination and analysis
of various documents

00:05:24.191 --> 00:05:27.194

is on Mount Molteau.

of each of these
three Legendary Pokémon!

00:05:52.419 --> 00:05:54.421

Aren't these Scatterbug

00:05:58.725 --> 00:06:00.227
Why are they rare?

00:06:00.227 --> 00:06:02.195
They look like normal
Scatterbug.

00:06:02.195 --> 00:06:04.197
What are you talking about?

00:06:04.197 --> 00:06:06.433

'See? The lengths are ever
so slightly different.'

00:06:09.536 --> 00:06:10.637
Wow, are they?

00:06:10.637 --> 00:06:12.339
Subtle, but they're not
the same.

00:06:12.339 --> 00:06:14.174
Hold on. That's important?

00:06:14.174 --> 00:06:15.408
Sure is!

00:06:15.408 --> 00:06:17.110
You see, it's almost
impossible

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:18.778
to find
this kind of Scatterbug.

00:06:18.778 --> 00:06:21.815
You can't get any more rare
than these two!

00:06:21.815 --> 00:06:24.651
Yup, this is a picture
almost no one gets!

00:06:24.651 --> 00:06:27.254
I've also got a Whiscash
with straight whiskers

00:06:27.254 --> 00:06:29.356
who's only
been spotted at Eur Lake.

00:06:29.356 --> 00:06:30.557
Then there's this Golem!

00:06:30.557 --> 00:06:31.892
The pattern of its shell
and body

00:06:31.892 --> 00:06:33.493
are slightly different
than usual.

00:06:33.493 --> 00:06:34.861
It's only been confirmed
recently

00:06:34.861 --> 00:06:36.463
and so few know about
it, I had a really hard time

00:06:36.463 --> 00:06:37.964
getting this picture.
Believe me!

00:06:37.964 --> 00:06:39.532
And look at this rare
Sableye with a crystal eye

00:06:39.532 --> 00:06:40.634
that's slightly
darker than usual!

00:06:40.634 --> 00:06:41.735
This is really rare too!

00:06:41.735 --> 00:06:44.571
Anyway, that's what
I have so far.

00:06:44.571 --> 00:06:46.940
So you all get it now, huh?

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:49.976
You bet.
You've met all kinds of Pokémon.

00:06:49.976 --> 00:06:54.414
Right. And Moltres is gonna be
the very next photograph I take.

00:06:54.414 --> 00:06:56.750
We'll help you look
for Moltres if you want.

00:06:56.750 --> 00:06:57.984
[EXCITED]

00:06:57.984 --> 00:06:59.519
It'll be much faster that way.

00:06:59.519 --> 00:07:01.454
‐ I wanna see too.
‐ Yay!

00:07:01.454 --> 00:07:03.523
‐ And don't forget me.
‐ Thank you!

00:07:03.523 --> 00:07:05.759
That would be a big help.

JESSIE 'That Pict‐o‐Twerp is
quite a go‐getter, isn't he?'

00:07:09.129 --> 00:07:11.564

imagined Moltres

00:07:11.564 --> 00:07:13.133
is hangin' out
on this mountain.

00:07:13.133 --> 00:07:15.635
If we were to procure
Legendary Pokémon

00:07:15.635 --> 00:07:17.570
Team Rocket could write
a one‐way ticket

00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:19.306
to Successville.

00:07:19.306 --> 00:07:21.041
MEOWTH 'Grabbin' Pikachu
would be a breeze'

00:07:21.041 --> 00:07:23.710
'and our grateful Boss
would be ever so pleased.'

00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:26.379
But catching Moltres
is job number one.

00:07:26.379 --> 00:07:27.981
So let's get that job done.

00:07:27.981 --> 00:07:29.115
‐ What fun.
‐ What fun.

00:07:29.115 --> 00:07:30.550
[EAGER]

00:07:32.986 --> 00:07:35.388
‐ This is Moltres for sure?
‐ Yup.

00:07:35.388 --> 00:07:36.790
No doubt about it!

00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:39.459
But it's really hard
to see anything.

00:07:39.459 --> 00:07:41.661
How do you know? Huh?

00:07:41.661 --> 00:07:45.131
There's no other Pokémon with
wings shaped just like that.

00:07:45.131 --> 00:07:48.234
And, according to my research,
Moltres has been spotted

00:07:48.234 --> 00:07:50.270
on Mount Molteau in the past.

00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:52.505
'It was an accident
that Moltres got in there'

00:07:52.505 --> 00:07:53.907
'in the first place.'

00:07:53.907 --> 00:07:56.176
'It didn't even know it was
being photographed.'

00:07:56.176 --> 00:08:00.113
'But if we head up to that big
rock, I know we'll see it!'

00:08:00.113 --> 00:08:01.448
Hm.

00:08:01.448 --> 00:08:03.717
SERENA 'So that's all we have
to go on, huh?'

00:08:06.653 --> 00:08:08.388
So we're heading to a big rock.

00:08:08.388 --> 00:08:10.590
I'd say this is my cue.

00:08:10.590 --> 00:08:14.027
And that means the future
is now, thanks to science!

00:08:14.027 --> 00:08:16.162
Clemontic Gear, on!

00:08:16.162 --> 00:08:18.164
I thought that we'd encounter
a situation

00:08:18.164 --> 00:08:19.699
precisely like this one.

00:08:19.699 --> 00:08:22.836
This is called
my Rock Searcher Mark One!

00:08:22.836 --> 00:08:24.571
"Rock Searcher Mark One?"

00:08:24.571 --> 00:08:26.506

this time?

00:08:32.746 --> 00:08:35.281
Huh?

00:08:35.281 --> 00:08:38.651
I input the landscape of this
photograph into its memory.

00:08:38.651 --> 00:08:41.354
Then my amazing device
will locate an exact match

00:08:41.354 --> 00:08:42.756
automatically.

00:08:42.756 --> 00:08:44.357
Awesome.

00:08:44.357 --> 00:08:47.027
Please save the praise
for later, my good friend.

00:08:47.027 --> 00:08:50.563
After we discover Moltres'
location, you can thank me.

[gasps]

00:09:23.463 --> 00:09:24.831
Looks like it's not a match.

00:09:24.831 --> 00:09:26.733
But it's still looking around.

It's Charmeleon!

[buzzing]

00:10:06.072 --> 00:10:08.274
Doesn't look like it's having
too much luck.

00:10:08.274 --> 00:10:09.776
[DISAPPOINTED]

00:10:09.776 --> 00:10:12.445
Aah! What's that?

00:10:12.445 --> 00:10:15.682
‐ Oh, that's just a Crustle.
‐ Look closer.

00:10:15.682 --> 00:10:18.118
You don't see that kind of
complex‐patterned layering

00:10:18.118 --> 00:10:19.619
hardly ever.

00:10:19.619 --> 00:10:21.688
‐ Huh?
‐ So cool!

00:10:21.688 --> 00:10:24.357
Huh? Look!

'The tips of that
Butterfree's antennae'

00:10:26.159 --> 00:10:27.861

'No, that's super‐rare!'

00:10:30.797 --> 00:10:34.167
I never dreamed I would run into
a Butterfree like that here!

00:10:34.167 --> 00:10:36.569
How lucky can I get?!

00:10:36.569 --> 00:10:38.638
I would say
that this particular area

00:10:38.638 --> 00:10:41.141
is a Pokémon photographer's
paradise.

00:10:42.041 --> 00:10:45.545
[gasps]
Wrong again.

00:10:45.545 --> 00:10:48.882
‐ Trevor! Let's go!
‐ Please, just one more minute.

00:10:48.882 --> 00:10:50.450
This is incredible!

00:10:50.450 --> 00:10:53.153
I think he's forgotten
about Moltres.

00:10:53.153 --> 00:10:54.787
He works so hard.

00:10:54.787 --> 00:10:57.590
Photography seems tough.

00:10:57.590 --> 00:10:59.359
Now's our chance
to get to Moltres

00:10:59.359 --> 00:11:00.827
before the Twerps do.

00:11:00.827 --> 00:11:02.262
Ooh.

MEOWTH
It stopped in its tracks.

00:11:11.905 --> 00:11:14.374
What's wrong? Getting lazy?

00:11:14.374 --> 00:11:15.775
Maybe it's on the fritz.

00:11:15.775 --> 00:11:17.810

we won't be able to procure

What was that?

00:11:34.527 --> 00:11:36.863
Not my Rock Searcher Mark One.

00:11:36.863 --> 00:11:38.631
Let's go find out.

where Moltres is.

To expose our roles
as Pikachu thieves!

00:12:38.625 --> 00:12:41.828
To denounce the evils
of taking appalling pics.

00:12:41.828 --> 00:12:45.131
To watch you lie there
like a ton of bricks!

The plan was to make Moltres
into one of our associates.

00:13:04.384 --> 00:13:07.086
But since the odds of you
finding it are zero

00:13:07.086 --> 00:13:09.355
we'll take Pikachu

I'll bet Moltres thinks
we're friends with Team Rocket!
