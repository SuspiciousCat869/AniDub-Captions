That's what happened.

That's why the owner changed.
Now I get it.

00:08:23.937 --> 00:08:26.873
I see. Those thieves
stole the hotel too.

00:08:26.873 --> 00:08:29.442
That's why Weston's
the front desk clerk.

Hey Clemont?
Is there anything we can do?

00:08:55.168 --> 00:08:56.403
It's tricky.

Yeah. It's a deal.

that Rotom showed us on TV.

we went back in time?

to fix everything!
