for the festival.

00:02:00.053 --> 00:02:03.056
‐ Hey, Ramos!
‐ Wow. A festival?

00:02:03.056 --> 00:02:06.426
The Coumarine City Festival
happens each and every year.

00:02:06.426 --> 00:02:08.095
There's a story.

00:02:08.095 --> 00:02:11.732
Long, long ago there was
a Trainer and his Pokémon.

00:02:11.732 --> 00:02:13.567
They went on a journey together

00:02:13.567 --> 00:02:16.003
and experienced
countless adventures.

00:02:16.003 --> 00:02:17.838
So, at the end of their journey

00:02:17.838 --> 00:02:19.272
they settled down in this land

00:02:19.272 --> 00:02:22.275
and lived here
happily ever after.

00:02:22.275 --> 00:02:24.845
In honor of their
lastin' friendship

00:02:24.845 --> 00:02:27.014
the Trainer gave
his Pokémon a little tree

00:02:27.014 --> 00:02:29.282
as a lovely reminder
of everything

00:02:29.282 --> 00:02:31.551
they had been through together.

00:02:31.551 --> 00:02:33.987
Before long,
that little tree grew and grew

00:02:33.987 --> 00:02:37.124
becomin' the largest tree
in Coumarine City.

00:02:37.124 --> 00:02:40.560
And that tree is known
as the Pledgin' Tree.

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.462
Oh! That sounds wonderful!

00:02:42.462 --> 00:02:45.599
Hold on a second.
Is that tree alive today?

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:47.968
RAMOS
Yes. That's it over there.

00:02:47.968 --> 00:02:50.003
ASH/BONNIE/CLEMONT/SERENA
Ah!

00:02:50.003 --> 00:02:52.806
RAMOS 'Since then, it is said
if a Trainer gives'

00:02:52.806 --> 00:02:56.009
'their Pokémon a gift
while standin' under that tree'

00:02:56.009 --> 00:02:58.545
'the bond between them
will grow even stronger.'

00:02:58.545 --> 00:02:59.946
'It's become a tradition.'

00:02:59.946 --> 00:03:02.015
‐ Wow. That is just so sweet!
‐ Oh.

00:03:02.015 --> 00:03:04.251
Ramos, what time
does the festival begin?

00:03:04.251 --> 00:03:06.520
It begins at sundown.

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:09.189
A Trainer first places
their Pokémon 's present

00:03:09.189 --> 00:03:10.724
underneath the Pledgin' Tree.

00:03:10.724 --> 00:03:12.559
And then the Trainer
offers the gift

00:03:12.559 --> 00:03:14.327
after the sun goes down.

00:03:14.327 --> 00:03:15.896
So, that's why
they're all headed

00:03:15.896 --> 00:03:17.631
toward the tree
with all that stuff!

00:03:17.631 --> 00:03:19.466
Sounds like a lot of fun!

00:03:19.466 --> 00:03:21.435
Why don't we do it, too?

00:03:21.435 --> 00:03:24.404

what I should give?'

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:38.885

buy those presents!

known for its shopping

00:03:41.621 --> 00:03:42.789
'right near the port.'

whatever we need!

a little different.
