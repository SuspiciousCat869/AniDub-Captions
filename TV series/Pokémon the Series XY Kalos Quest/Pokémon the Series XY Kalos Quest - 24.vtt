I was hoping to
entertain you all

00:07:40.193 --> 00:07:42.829
with the scariest story
I could think of.

00:07:42.829 --> 00:07:44.931
But I guess I failed. Sorry.

00:07:44.931 --> 00:07:48.068
You see, I've told many
visitors scary stories

00:07:48.068 --> 00:07:49.736
just like that one.

00:07:49.736 --> 00:07:52.839
Those stories are the reason
this old mansion got to be known

00:07:52.839 --> 00:07:54.341
as "the scary house."

00:07:54.341 --> 00:07:56.509
Makes sense to me.

00:07:56.509 --> 00:07:58.311

I'm not doing this.

Yay! A ghost! Hello?

00:08:08.989 --> 00:08:10.523
Sounds paranormal to me.

00:08:10.523 --> 00:08:12.559
Ah! This is not possible.

00:08:12.559 --> 00:08:16.029
There's not a thing science
can't prove. Including this.

00:08:16.029 --> 00:08:18.331
Then why don't you stop
acting so scared already?

[grunts]

00:08:19.432 --> 00:08:21.534
That has nothing
to do with this!

[grunts]

00:08:22.635 --> 00:08:24.437
Can science prove that?

00:08:24.437 --> 00:08:25.972
I would be very grateful.

00:08:25.972 --> 00:08:26.973

I guess that's my cue.

Are you sure
you're feeling okay?

00:14:53.893 --> 00:14:57.029
It's just, I feel like
I'm forgetting something.

00:14:57.029 --> 00:14:59.365
I think it's better
if you wait here.

00:15:06.372 --> 00:15:08.808
I'll find you. Promise.

00:15:10.610 --> 00:15:12.945
Not scared. I'm not scared.

00:15:12.945 --> 00:15:14.680

That door.
It's sealed shut.

00:15:22.889 --> 00:15:25.291
But still, I've got to go.

00:15:32.732 --> 00:15:35.201
Why are those tags stuck
all over the door?

ASH
'Is that you, Clemont?'

00:15:36.502 --> 00:15:37.670

you're in there, too!

00:15:40.406 --> 00:15:42.508
ASH
'Yeah. And Serena.'

00:15:42.508 --> 00:15:44.377
We've been really trying
to get out of here

00:15:44.377 --> 00:15:47.079
but the door is so rusted,
it wont budge.

00:15:47.079 --> 00:15:48.414
Can you open it from your side?

00:15:48.414 --> 00:15:49.782
[ENCOURAGING]

00:15:49.782 --> 00:15:52.318

[grunting]

00:15:55.321 --> 00:15:58.858
No. No good. Probably
been shut for a long time.

00:15:58.858 --> 00:16:01.761
Wait, if it's rust,
then Frogadier's Frubbles

00:16:01.761 --> 00:16:03.162
should do the trick.

00:16:03.162 --> 00:16:05.832
You're right.
What a great idea.

00:16:05.832 --> 00:16:07.934

I choose you.'

00:16:10.636 --> 00:16:13.139
Frogadier, throw your

[FRUBBLES MOVE]

00:16:18.177 --> 00:16:20.646
Yes.

00:16:20.646 --> 00:16:21.647
Now..

00:16:21.647 --> 00:16:24.750
[grunting]

00:16:26.586 --> 00:16:28.855
‐ You're alright.
‐ Big brother.

00:16:28.855 --> 00:16:31.057
Oh. Were you scared?

00:16:31.057 --> 00:16:33.659
Mm‐mm. I wasn't scared one bit.

00:16:33.659 --> 00:16:35.995
I knew Bonnie was
gonna say that.

00:16:35.995 --> 00:16:38.030
Were you scared?
Tell the truth.

00:16:38.030 --> 00:16:41.067
Not me, because I had
a little sister to save.

00:16:41.067 --> 00:16:42.435
[giggles]

00:16:43.603 --> 00:16:44.937

00:16:47.607 --> 00:16:48.708

00:16:50.977 --> 00:16:52.378
[WORRIED]

00:16:52.378 --> 00:16:53.880
Here we are.

00:16:53.880 --> 00:16:55.248

00:16:58.284 --> 00:17:01.354
It's good to see you.
Glad you're safe.

00:17:01.354 --> 00:17:04.423
The trap doors are all connected
to a room in the basement.

00:17:04.423 --> 00:17:05.424
Through hidden chutes.

00:17:05.424 --> 00:17:07.360
‐ The basement?
‐ Yeah.

00:17:07.360 --> 00:17:10.062
The basement door had a bunch
of tags pasted onto it.

00:17:10.062 --> 00:17:12.498
And we found this journal
in the basement.

00:17:14.734 --> 00:17:16.836
You found a journal?

00:17:16.836 --> 00:17:18.571
Please read it to me.

00:17:18.571 --> 00:17:20.773
Sure.

00:17:20.773 --> 00:17:22.275
Let's see.

00:17:22.275 --> 00:17:25.278
"I was always afraid in this
house, so I asked my dad

00:17:25.278 --> 00:17:28.548
"to make a room in the basement
that no one else could get into.

00:17:28.548 --> 00:17:31.284
'A super‐secret room
just for me"'

00:17:31.284 --> 00:17:33.486
That must be the room
we got stuck in.

00:17:33.486 --> 00:17:36.355
"He even made me
a bunch of cool passageways

00:17:36.355 --> 00:17:38.724
"so I could go to the room
from anywhere in the house

00:17:38.724 --> 00:17:41.260
'right away when something
was scaring me."'

00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:43.262
Those are the trap doors.

00:17:43.262 --> 00:17:45.264
"But the scary things
kept happening

00:17:45.264 --> 00:17:47.033
"so my dad finally
brought a medium

00:17:47.033 --> 00:17:49.635
"who could drive away
the spirits of the house.

00:17:49.635 --> 00:17:52.371
"Afterwards, he gave me
a bunch of banishing tags

00:17:52.371 --> 00:17:54.407
to stick on my door."

00:17:54.407 --> 00:17:56.576
So that's what all those
paper things were.

00:17:56.576 --> 00:17:59.211
They were placed there
on the door for good luck.

00:17:59.211 --> 00:18:02.381
"Even so, scary things
kept happening.

00:18:02.381 --> 00:18:04.750
"So we're finally moving
out of here today.

00:18:04.750 --> 00:18:06.953
This is my last day
in the house."

00:18:08.721 --> 00:18:09.822
Huh?

00:18:12.658 --> 00:18:15.061
I wonder if the writer
is this boy.

00:18:17.096 --> 00:18:20.199
Hey. He kind of looks
like you, don't you think?

00:18:20.199 --> 00:18:21.834
Oh!

00:18:21.834 --> 00:18:23.169
Ah, right!

00:18:23.169 --> 00:18:24.604
How could I have forgotten?

00:18:24.604 --> 00:18:25.938
That is me.

00:18:25.938 --> 00:18:27.306

00:18:27.306 --> 00:18:29.208
What are you talking about?

00:18:29.208 --> 00:18:31.043
Well..

00:18:31.043 --> 00:18:34.013
I completely forgot about
that room and how I put up

00:18:34.013 --> 00:18:35.881
all of those paper
good luck charms.

Back then, all you wanted to do
was play and have a little fun.

00:18:53.132 --> 00:18:54.533
And yet

00:18:54.533 --> 00:18:57.003
my family thought it was
something completely different.

00:18:57.003 --> 00:18:59.805
And so, we moved.

00:18:59.805 --> 00:19:01.107
Of course.

00:19:01.107 --> 00:19:04.877
