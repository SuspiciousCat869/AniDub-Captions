'This is hard for me too.'

00:17:56.909 --> 00:17:58.978
'But Goodra, you're strong now.'

00:17:58.978 --> 00:18:01.147
You're not
a little Goomy anymore.

00:18:01.147 --> 00:18:03.649
Now you can help
and protect all your friends.

00:18:03.649 --> 00:18:06.252
Now you'll all be able
to live together happily.

00:18:06.252 --> 00:18:10.156
That's what you wanted
most of all, right?

00:18:26.305 --> 00:18:28.040
I think he's right.

00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:30.876
Maybe it is the best thing
for Goodra.

00:18:30.876 --> 00:18:34.413
The wetlands
and for all these Pokémon.

[SAD]

00:19:18.224 --> 00:19:21.293
Even if we're far apart,
no matter what happens

00:19:21.293 --> 00:19:23.496
we'll always be friends.

00:19:23.496 --> 00:19:25.431
We'll always be friends.

00:19:43.549 --> 00:19:46.819
Goodbye, Goodra,
I'll never forget you.

00:19:46.819 --> 00:19:48.954
And please,
don't forget about us.

00:19:48.954 --> 00:19:50.756
We're forever friends.

[crying]

00:20:10.476 --> 00:20:13.946
Now, look at me.
I'm all slimy, aren't I?

[UPSET]

00:20:26.225 --> 00:20:28.327
Take good care
of yourself, Goodra!

00:20:28.327 --> 00:20:29.929
And all your friends!

00:20:34.834 --> 00:20:37.069
Bye! See you again!

Saying goodbye to a friend

00:20:41.474 --> 00:20:43.642
is always a difficult task

00:20:43.642 --> 00:20:47.279
but it's sometimes a necessary
part of the rich experiences

00:20:47.279 --> 00:20:50.649
our heroes have come
to know along their way

00:20:50.649 --> 00:20:53.119
as their journey continues.
