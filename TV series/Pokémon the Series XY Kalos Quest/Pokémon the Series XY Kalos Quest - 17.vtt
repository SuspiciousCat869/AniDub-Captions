‐ Strategy, huh?
‐ Right.

00:02:01.655 --> 00:02:03.590
You'd better think
about Clemont's Pokémon

and figure out how
you're going to battle them.

Yeah.
Now, let's see.

00:02:07.027 --> 00:02:11.198
Clemont's Pokémon are Bunnelby
and Chespin and Luxray, so..

00:02:11.198 --> 00:02:13.767
He's also got
Magneton and Heliolisk.

Alright.

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.809
No way.
Clemont's a Gym Leader?

‐ No kidding?
‐ Yeah.

00:02:58.145 --> 00:03:00.881
And he's in Lumiose City now
getting ready for our battle.

I remember challenging
the Lumiose City Gym once.

But I know
I didn't see Clemont.

It made its move
based on the similar juice

It trained super hard
and got stronger.

00:16:57.483 --> 00:17:00.286
It won't lose
to anyone again.

00:17:00.286 --> 00:17:03.289
Makes sense to me.

00:17:03.289 --> 00:17:06.692
Goodra, you're a lucky Pokémon
to have a Trainer like Ash.

00:17:06.692 --> 00:17:08.094
[AGREEMENT]

00:17:08.094 --> 00:17:12.098
Hold on. We haven't had our
battle. What do you say, Tierno?

00:17:12.098 --> 00:17:13.432
[EXCITED]

00:17:13.432 --> 00:17:15.735
Yeah, let's go.

00:17:25.411 --> 00:17:27.413
Alright, Pikachu,
use Quick Attack!

00:17:27.413 --> 00:17:29.615
[AGREEMENT]/[QUICK ATTACK MOVE]

00:17:29.615 --> 00:17:30.716
[STRUGGLING]

00:17:30.716 --> 00:17:32.818
Wartortle,
use the recoil to spin.

00:17:32.818 --> 00:17:33.886
[SPIN MOVE]

00:17:33.886 --> 00:17:35.621
[EXERTION]

00:17:35.621 --> 00:17:36.889
Quick, dodge it.

00:17:36.889 --> 00:17:37.957
[DODGING]

00:17:37.957 --> 00:17:40.159
[EXERTION]

00:17:41.193 --> 00:17:43.529
Raichu, aim Charge Beam
at Goodra.

00:17:43.529 --> 00:17:44.830
[CHARGE BEAM MOVE]

00:17:44.830 --> 00:17:46.799
Alright, Goodra, use Bide!

00:17:46.799 --> 00:17:49.035
[BIDE MOVE]

00:17:52.772 --> 00:17:55.575
Alright,
keep pushing. Focus Blast.

00:17:55.575 --> 00:17:58.210
[FOCUS BLAST MOVE]

00:18:01.480 --> 00:18:03.382
[ANGRY]

00:18:03.382 --> 00:18:07.453
Goodra's tough. A bit slow, but
its endurance is first‐rate.

00:18:07.453 --> 00:18:09.989
Now, Raichu,
Focus Blast one more time.

00:18:09.989 --> 00:18:11.857
[FOCUS BLAST MOVE]

00:18:11.857 --> 00:18:14.360
Pikachu, intercept it
with Electro Ball.

00:18:14.360 --> 00:18:15.361
[EXERTION]

00:18:15.361 --> 00:18:17.196
Help Raichu. Rapid Spin.

00:18:17.196 --> 00:18:18.297
[EXERTION]

00:18:18.297 --> 00:18:21.133
[PAINED]

00:18:23.569 --> 00:18:26.472
[ATTACK]

00:18:26.472 --> 00:18:28.774
Get ready, Wartortle.
Use Hydro Pump.

00:18:28.774 --> 00:18:29.942
[HYDRO PUMP MOVE]

00:18:29.942 --> 00:18:31.277
Iron Tail.

00:18:31.277 --> 00:18:33.479
[EXERTION]

00:18:33.479 --> 00:18:35.514
[SCARED]

00:18:35.514 --> 00:18:37.283
Uh, that's so cool.

00:18:37.283 --> 00:18:38.884
[EXERTION]

00:18:38.884 --> 00:18:40.186
[chuckles]

00:18:40.186 --> 00:18:42.355
I thought we had you beat.
I guess not.

00:18:42.355 --> 00:18:44.590
[EXCITED]

00:18:44.590 --> 00:18:47.293
Alright.
It's time to use some rhythm.

00:18:47.293 --> 00:18:50.229
[DANCING]

00:18:55.067 --> 00:18:58.504
Wartortle, use Skull Bash
on Goodra, now.

00:18:58.504 --> 00:18:59.605
[SKULL BASH MOVE]

00:18:59.605 --> 00:19:00.673
[PAINED]

00:19:00.673 --> 00:19:03.542
Alright. Hold it there.

00:19:03.542 --> 00:19:04.844
Wartortle?

00:19:04.844 --> 00:19:06.712
[PAINED]

00:19:06.712 --> 00:19:09.715
Raichu, help out. Focus Blast.

00:19:09.715 --> 00:19:11.150
Electro Ball, quick.

00:19:11.150 --> 00:19:13.986
[ELECTRO BALL MOVE]

00:19:13.986 --> 00:19:15.721
[FOCUS BLAST MOVE]

00:19:15.721 --> 00:19:19.091
Goodra, throw Wartortle.

00:19:21.661 --> 00:19:23.629
[SCARED]/[PAINED]

00:19:23.629 --> 00:19:25.631
[PAINED]/[CONFUSED]

00:19:25.631 --> 00:19:27.767
Keep up the beat.
Get moving!

00:19:27.767 --> 00:19:29.702
[CONFUSED]

00:19:29.702 --> 00:19:31.704
‐ Uh.
‐ They lost their rhythm.

00:19:31.704 --> 00:19:35.007
Pikachu, use Thunderbolt
on Wartortle, let's go.

00:19:35.007 --> 00:19:38.010
[THUNDERBOLT MOVE]

00:19:38.010 --> 00:19:40.379
Goodra.
Dragon Pulse on Raichu.

00:19:40.379 --> 00:19:43.816
[DRAGON PULSE MOVE]

00:19:43.816 --> 00:19:46.819
[SCARED]/[PAINED]

00:19:46.819 --> 00:19:49.288
[DAZED]

00:19:49.288 --> 00:19:51.424
Wartortle and Raichu.

00:19:51.424 --> 00:19:55.361
We did it.
We won the battle. Yeah!

00:19:55.361 --> 00:19:57.229
[EXCITED]

00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:02.468
Thanks a lot, Tierno.

00:20:02.468 --> 00:20:04.670
We did some great training
because of you.

00:20:04.670 --> 00:20:07.873
I want you to battle the Lumiose
City Gym just like today.

00:20:07.873 --> 00:20:11.010
Right. And next time I see you,
let's battle again.

00:20:11.010 --> 00:20:14.413
You got it. Say hi to Clemont
for me, will you?

00:20:14.413 --> 00:20:16.882
Hm. Take care
of yourself, Tierno.

00:20:16.882 --> 00:20:18.184
[HAPPY]

00:20:18.184 --> 00:20:20.019
SERENA And say hi to Shauna
and Trevor too.

00:20:20.019 --> 00:20:22.722
Will do.
Stay well everybody.

00:20:26.792 --> 00:20:31.363
[chuckles]
I see it. I see it.

00:20:31.363 --> 00:20:35.101
There it is. We finally made it.
Lumiose City.

00:20:35.101 --> 00:20:37.903
Clemont, here we come.
Won't be long now.

00:20:37.903 --> 00:20:40.039
[EXCITED]

00:20:40.039 --> 00:20:42.141
NARRATOR As the glittering
lights of Lumiose City

00:20:42.141 --> 00:20:43.843
illuminate the night sky.

00:20:43.843 --> 00:20:45.745
There's no doubt
Ash is wondering

00:20:45.745 --> 00:20:48.581
what kind of Gym battle
against Clemont awaits him

00:20:48.581 --> 00:20:53.519
at the Lumiose City Gym, as our
heroes' journey continues.

00:20:56.856 --> 00:20:59.959
