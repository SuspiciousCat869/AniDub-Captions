00:18:19.465 --> 00:18:21.000
Excuse me, Keanan?

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.803
Are there any Pokémon around
here who are able to use

00:18:23.803 --> 00:18:25.871
Psybeam and Shadow Ball?

00:18:25.871 --> 00:18:27.306
Huh?

00:18:36.182 --> 00:18:39.752
JESSIE 'Well, all I can say is
that was too close for comfort.'

00:18:39.752 --> 00:18:41.988
If you had lost, what do you
think would've happened

00:18:41.988 --> 00:18:43.255
to that little one there?

00:18:43.255 --> 00:18:44.924
[AFFIRMATIVE]

00:18:47.226 --> 00:18:49.762
It touched us that you'd step up
to the plate and battle

00:18:49.762 --> 00:18:51.230
as hard as you did
so you could keep

00:18:51.230 --> 00:18:53.265
that little buddy of yours
away from harm.

00:18:53.265 --> 00:18:56.102
And that's why
we jumped in like we did.

00:18:56.102 --> 00:18:59.105
MEOWTH 'We know that Goodra
like I know the back of my paw.'

00:18:59.105 --> 00:19:00.973
'The ups and the downs.'

00:19:00.973 --> 00:19:04.744
'So if we join forces, we can
beat that big lug for sure.'

00:19:04.744 --> 00:19:07.980
You want to help
your little pal, don't you?

00:19:11.951 --> 00:19:15.688
MEOWTH
'So, listen up and listen well.'

00:19:17.723 --> 00:19:19.692
Is it a deal?

00:19:43.783 --> 00:19:47.586
You'd do anything for all
of your friends, wouldn't you?

00:19:57.029 --> 00:20:00.933
So when we first met
and you wanted to get stronger

00:20:00.933 --> 00:20:03.502
it was just so you could help
them all out.

00:20:11.343 --> 00:20:14.046
Something's definitely
not right.

00:20:14.046 --> 00:20:15.915
Let's look
at the surveillance camera.

00:20:15.915 --> 00:20:18.584
Okay.
Maybe we can figure this out.

00:20:18.584 --> 00:20:21.120
Oh. Hey, it's them!

00:20:21.587 --> 00:20:22.822
[screams]

00:20:22.822 --> 00:20:23.856
[SCARED]

00:20:23.856 --> 00:20:26.292
Pikachu! Wooper! Dedenne!

00:20:26.292 --> 00:20:29.195
Give back my Pikachu! Stop!

00:20:29.195 --> 00:20:32.164
NARRATOR Now that Team Rocket
is joining forces with Florges

00:20:32.164 --> 00:20:34.700
what new evil scheme
are they plotting?

00:20:34.700 --> 00:20:38.838
And what will become of
Pikachu, Wooper, and Dedenne?

00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:44.543
[laughing]

00:20:50.850 --> 00:20:53.219
The journey continues.
