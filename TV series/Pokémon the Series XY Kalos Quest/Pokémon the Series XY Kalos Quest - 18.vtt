I'm back. Yay!

And I'm so glad
that you're back.

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.536
It's a pleasure
to see everyone again.

00:00:35.536 --> 00:00:37.404
Thanks.
It sure has been a while.

00:00:37.404 --> 00:00:39.540
So, Bonnie, how has everything
been going?

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.676
Awesome! Looks like everything's
going good for you too.

all the nice girls

I've been asking
to take care of you.

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:51.652
‐ Ah.
‐ So many keepers!

00:00:51.652 --> 00:00:53.186
So much has happened
since you left!

00:00:53.186 --> 00:00:54.988
Now, just calm down.

00:00:54.988 --> 00:00:57.591
You can tell me all about it
later. Deal?

tuck me in anymore

Serena does it now.

‐ Right!

00:01:03.964 --> 00:01:05.332
So, what do you say?

00:01:05.332 --> 00:01:07.634
Ready for me to challenge
the Lumiose Gym?

00:01:07.634 --> 00:01:09.236

Um, hi, there.

We were just getting
an important battle started.

Clembot, look at this.

You're under arrest.

What did I do wrong?

I assure you I am
completely innocent, sir.

00:03:47.694 --> 00:03:50.797
I know, Clembot. It must be
some kind of a mistake.

00:03:50.797 --> 00:03:53.867
Don't worry. I promise
I'll prove your innocence.

No matter what it takes.

00:03:55.302 --> 00:03:58.672

No doubt there's been some
weird stuff going on

but what does Clembot
have to do with this?

00:04:25.298 --> 00:04:26.900
[CONFUSED]

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:30.904
Look at these.
They're surveillance videos.

00:04:30.904 --> 00:04:33.440
‐ Oh, no.
‐ It's proof positive.

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:36.376
Would you mind zooming in
a little bit closer?

00:04:37.811 --> 00:04:41.281
See that? I know Clembot has
a dent on the top of its head.

00:04:41.281 --> 00:04:43.450
But this robot doesn't have one!

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:46.052
I'm afraid this video
doesn't prove that.

00:04:46.052 --> 00:04:48.688
So you're saying that
it's definitely Clembot?

00:04:48.688 --> 00:04:50.824
Officer Jenny. Wait.

00:04:50.824 --> 00:04:52.759
I can vouch
for Clembot's innocence

00:04:52.759 --> 00:04:54.928
because I've been
with Clembot constantly.

00:04:54.928 --> 00:04:57.631
Alibis provided by friends
aren't reliable.

00:04:57.631 --> 00:04:59.533
And with all the evidence
I have

00:04:59.533 --> 00:05:02.269
'I'll have to make an arrest.'

00:05:02.269 --> 00:05:05.806
So all we have to do is prove
that Clembot's innocent, right?

00:05:05.806 --> 00:05:07.073
Right.

00:05:08.642 --> 00:05:11.711

robot, innocent.

00:05:26.893 --> 00:05:28.762
So they've arrested Clembot?

00:05:28.762 --> 00:05:30.330
Clembot did nothing wrong!

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:32.165

‐ 'Videos?'
‐ 'Yes.'

00:05:40.073 --> 00:05:43.577
They're of the three‐star hotel
and high‐end boutique incidents.

00:05:43.577 --> 00:05:45.846
They were caught
by security cameras

00:05:45.846 --> 00:05:49.349
and both videos show a robot
who looks just like Clembot.

00:05:49.349 --> 00:05:52.586
‐ But it's not Clembot.
‐ Of course. I know that.

00:05:52.586 --> 00:05:55.689
So I've been looking
into those incidents on my own.

00:05:55.689 --> 00:05:57.457
During my research

00:05:57.457 --> 00:06:01.027
I discovered the man in
the Blaziken mask is involved.

00:06:01.027 --> 00:06:02.963
Blaziken Mask? No way.

00:06:02.963 --> 00:06:06.499
It seems he's trying to get
to the bottom of this as well.

00:06:06.499 --> 00:06:09.469
Ha! You're not serious,
are you?

00:06:09.469 --> 00:06:11.605
You're saying
Blaziken Mask is real?

00:06:11.605 --> 00:06:14.674
Yeah. And he's always
with his Mega Blaziken.

00:06:14.674 --> 00:06:19.179
Uh, Mega Blaziken?
Well, that's a new one on me.

00:06:19.179 --> 00:06:22.415
It's true! Blaziken Mask
has helped us before.

00:06:27.888 --> 00:06:32.392
That Blaziken Mask just might
have some kind of lead.

00:06:32.392 --> 00:06:35.729
Those videos are all we have,
at least for now.

00:06:35.729 --> 00:06:39.466
All I can think of is it was
made to look just like Clembot.

00:06:39.466 --> 00:06:41.434
But they'd need blueprints.

00:06:41.434 --> 00:06:44.271
They wouldn't be able to make
Clembot without them, right?

00:06:44.271 --> 00:06:45.438
Right.

00:06:45.438 --> 00:06:47.207
So tell me,
where are the blueprints?

00:06:47.207 --> 00:06:49.409
I filed them up in Prism Tower.

00:06:49.409 --> 00:06:51.278
They're saved
on the computer there.

00:06:51.278 --> 00:06:53.446
Then I suggest you go there
right now

00:06:53.446 --> 00:06:54.948
and see if you can
find any leads.

00:06:54.948 --> 00:06:56.149
Right!

00:06:56.149 --> 00:06:58.418
Meanwhile,
I'll see what I can find out.

00:06:58.418 --> 00:07:00.487
That would be great.

00:07:00.487 --> 00:07:03.156
We're gonna prove Clembot
had nothing to do with this.

00:07:03.156 --> 00:07:04.691
‐ For sure.
‐ Alright!

00:07:04.691 --> 00:07:07.394
[EXCITED]

00:07:10.563 --> 00:07:12.165
‐ Ah.
‐ What's up?

00:07:12.165 --> 00:07:14.134
I've uncovered
concrete evidence

00:07:14.134 --> 00:07:15.702
that this computer's
been hacked.

00:07:15.702 --> 00:07:17.804
So what about the blueprints?

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:23.710
It appears somebody located
and copied all of them.

00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:26.212
Then that means that Alexa
was right all along.

00:07:26.212 --> 00:07:29.049
Now, hold on just one sec.

00:07:29.049 --> 00:07:31.584
If I can trace the computer
that hacked into this one

00:07:31.584 --> 00:07:32.786
in the first place.

00:07:32.786 --> 00:07:34.287
You can do that?

00:07:37.657 --> 00:07:40.093
Apparently this shows
the hackers were working

00:07:40.093 --> 00:07:41.895
from Lumiose University

00:07:41.895 --> 00:07:44.197
on the robotics
department's server.

00:07:46.366 --> 00:07:48.668
'Ah‐ha! Clembot's blueprints.'

00:07:48.668 --> 00:07:51.638
'This proves
they stole them from there.'

00:07:51.638 --> 00:07:54.708
They even stole
Clembot's operating system.

00:07:54.708 --> 00:07:55.809
Huh?

00:07:55.809 --> 00:07:58.745
'That's it.
The robot in the videos.'

00:07:58.745 --> 00:08:01.448
It looks
exactly like Clembot.

00:08:01.448 --> 00:08:03.316
Like Clembot's
got an evil twin.

00:08:03.316 --> 00:08:06.853
And that means
that Clembot's bad.

00:08:06.853 --> 00:08:09.556
CLEMONT
'It says electronic storage.'

00:08:10.657 --> 00:08:13.727
Look at that.
It's the Lumiose Museum.

00:08:13.727 --> 00:08:15.428
BONNIE
Lumiose Museum?

00:08:15.428 --> 00:08:17.998
Maybe they're gonna
hit it next.

00:08:17.998 --> 00:08:20.133
That's a distinct possibility.

00:08:20.133 --> 00:08:22.736
Let's make a copy
and give it to Officer Jenny.

00:08:26.239 --> 00:08:27.474
Huh?

00:08:28.508 --> 00:08:32.445
It says Belmondo.
Is that a name?

00:08:41.021 --> 00:08:42.989
Alright then, Dark Clembot.

00:08:42.989 --> 00:08:45.458
Let's do this
with more of a kick today.

00:08:45.458 --> 00:08:47.460
Understood, master.

00:08:52.866 --> 00:08:55.301
Now, Magneton, use Discharge!

00:08:55.301 --> 00:08:57.404
[DISCHARGE MOVE]

00:09:02.342 --> 00:09:04.644
Alright. Here we go.

00:09:05.578 --> 00:09:08.581
[explosions]

00:09:08.581 --> 00:09:11.351
All the latest electronics
are stored here.

00:09:11.351 --> 00:09:13.953
Perfect for raising
some Team Rocket cash.

00:09:13.953 --> 00:09:16.523
But there's somethin'
we hadn't bargained for.

00:09:17.690 --> 00:09:19.993
JESSIE
'A Pokémon‐controlling robot.'

00:09:19.993 --> 00:09:22.729
'Bonus time!
Tailor‐made for Team Rocket.'

00:09:22.729 --> 00:09:24.431
Well, then..

00:09:24.431 --> 00:09:26.232
Let's grab it and go!

00:09:26.232 --> 00:09:27.967
‐ Righteo!
‐ Righteo!

00:09:27.967 --> 00:09:30.403
GROUP
Who's that Pokémon?

00:09:35.108 --> 00:09:37.243
It's Magneton!

00:09:46.519 --> 00:09:49.155
It looks exactly like Clembot.

00:09:49.155 --> 00:09:51.691
We gave the surveillance footage
a closer look.

00:09:51.691 --> 00:09:53.693
There was no dent
on its head.

00:09:53.693 --> 00:09:55.895
Because it isn't Clembot.
I tried to tell you!

00:09:55.895 --> 00:09:57.397
You see Officer Jenny?

00:09:57.397 --> 00:10:00.533
That robot is the one
who did all that horrible stuff.

00:10:00.533 --> 00:10:02.869
That possibility
can't be ruled out.

00:10:02.869 --> 00:10:05.638
So tell me, Clemont,
where exactly

00:10:05.638 --> 00:10:07.240
did you get a hold
of this data?

00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:10.276
I discovered someone hacked
into the Prism Tower computer

00:10:10.276 --> 00:10:12.112
and stole Clembot's blueprints.

00:10:12.112 --> 00:10:14.280
I kept tracing it further
and further back

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:16.683
until I found
the keyword "Belmondo."

00:10:16.683 --> 00:10:18.017
Doctor Belmondo?

00:10:18.017 --> 00:10:19.819
Is that name familiar?

00:10:19.819 --> 00:10:21.855
Of course.

00:10:21.855 --> 00:10:24.057
He's a robotics researcher.

00:10:24.057 --> 00:10:27.193
And he stole blueprints
from the Prism Tower computer?

00:10:27.193 --> 00:10:28.561
I'll investigate.

00:10:28.561 --> 00:10:29.829
‐ One more thing.
‐ Huh?

00:10:29.829 --> 00:10:31.397
Please, have a look at this.

00:10:31.397 --> 00:10:34.601
These are floor plans
for an electronics warehouse.

00:10:34.601 --> 00:10:37.504
Oh, no! Another incident
just occurred there!

00:10:37.504 --> 00:10:39.706
[gasps]
What happened?

00:10:40.907 --> 00:10:42.208
BONNIE
'Oh, no!'

00:10:42.208 --> 00:10:44.711
Those electronics
were burnt to a crisp.

00:10:44.711 --> 00:10:46.479
That's awful.

00:10:46.479 --> 00:10:49.249
And this situation
is only getting worse.

00:10:49.249 --> 00:10:50.884
Ah, that's right.

00:10:50.884 --> 00:10:52.719
He had Lumiose
Museum files too.

00:10:52.719 --> 00:10:54.454
The Lumiose Museum?

00:10:54.454 --> 00:10:56.089
If they're going
to strike again

00:10:56.089 --> 00:10:59.025
it's possible that
they'll target the museum next.

00:10:59.025 --> 00:11:02.061
Right. So that proves
Clembot's innocent.

00:11:02.061 --> 00:11:04.998
‐ Please, release Clembot.
‐ Hm.

00:11:04.998 --> 00:11:08.401
Officer, please! The only one
who can stop Fake Clembot

00:11:08.401 --> 00:11:10.870
is Clembot and you know it!

00:11:10.870 --> 00:11:12.038
Alright. I will.

00:11:12.038 --> 00:11:13.573
[HAPPY]

00:11:15.308 --> 00:11:17.310
Sorry for the trouble I caused.

00:11:17.310 --> 00:11:18.945
Okay, you're free to go.

00:11:18.945 --> 00:11:21.481
BONNIE
I'm so happy!

00:11:21.481 --> 00:11:24.517
Clembot, please.
We need your help right away!

00:11:24.517 --> 00:11:25.985
Sir?

00:11:25.985 --> 00:11:28.555
CLEMONT The real criminal needs
to be caught now!

00:11:28.555 --> 00:11:30.690
I'm happy to help.

00:11:30.690 --> 00:11:32.959
Alright! It's all for one!

00:11:32.959 --> 00:11:38.298
ASH/SERENA/CLEMONT/BONNIE
Yeah!

00:11:38.298 --> 00:11:41.000
I've already notified
the museum officials.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.536
The most important thing
to remember is you must

00:11:43.536 --> 00:11:45.305
stay hidden and quiet.

00:11:45.305 --> 00:11:47.407
We'll strike once
they're caught in the act.

00:11:47.407 --> 00:11:49.175
Let me know
if anything comes up.

00:11:49.175 --> 00:11:50.610
ASH/SERENA/CLEMONT/BONNIE
We will!

00:11:58.017 --> 00:12:00.186
[gasps]

00:12:00.186 --> 00:12:02.121
Huh?

00:12:02.121 --> 00:12:03.590
Oh!

00:12:03.590 --> 00:12:05.358
Look! Up there!

00:12:12.465 --> 00:12:15.101
Alright.
Time to work, Dark Clembot.

00:12:15.101 --> 00:12:16.836
Understood.

00:12:17.971 --> 00:12:20.573
[grunting]

00:12:23.676 --> 00:12:28.181
Ah! Huh! Huh?

00:12:28.181 --> 00:12:29.983
Who are you?

00:12:29.983 --> 00:12:33.886
This monster was trying to
sneak inside the Lumiose Museum.

00:12:33.886 --> 00:12:35.688
CLEMONT Just what are you
planning to do

00:12:35.688 --> 00:12:37.890
with that fake
Clembot?

00:12:37.890 --> 00:12:42.228
To frame your robot as a common
criminal. Simple as that.

00:12:42.228 --> 00:12:44.230
I'll go and get
Officer Jenny right now.

00:12:44.230 --> 00:12:46.466
Okay.

00:12:46.466 --> 00:12:48.067
BELMONDO
Mark my words.

00:12:48.067 --> 00:12:51.537
I make the very best robots
the world has ever seen!

00:12:51.537 --> 00:12:53.439
From the moment I saw
your Clembot

00:12:53.439 --> 00:12:55.441
I knew it wasn't complete.

00:12:55.441 --> 00:12:58.311
And that's when I realized
what needed to be done.

00:12:58.311 --> 00:13:02.482
So I did it. My Dark Clembot
is robot perfection!

00:13:02.482 --> 00:13:05.485
The greatest robot
that has ever been created.

00:13:05.485 --> 00:13:07.253
You couldn't be more wrong.

00:13:07.253 --> 00:13:11.190
My Clembot is a masterpiece
of robotic design!

00:13:11.190 --> 00:13:13.259
Think what you want,
but there's no doubt

00:13:13.259 --> 00:13:16.296
you've ruined my ambition
to frame your robot

00:13:16.296 --> 00:13:19.232
'and have Dark Clembot
be the hero who catches him'

00:13:19.232 --> 00:13:20.667
'and saves the day!'

00:13:20.667 --> 00:13:24.337
So now we must battle
to find out which robot is best.

00:13:24.337 --> 00:13:27.473
'Let's see which robot is truly
the greatest!'

00:13:27.473 --> 00:13:29.976
You used the magnificent power
of science

00:13:29.976 --> 00:13:32.211
to fulfill
your own selfish ambitions.

00:13:32.211 --> 00:13:33.713
I'll take you on!

00:13:33.713 --> 00:13:36.449
Look what we have here.
A Pokémon battle.

00:13:36.449 --> 00:13:38.584
Magneton, go!

00:13:38.584 --> 00:13:41.254
[APPEARING]

00:13:41.254 --> 00:13:44.457
Alright then.
Clembot, I'm counting on you!

00:13:44.457 --> 00:13:47.927

Heliolisk, come out!

00:13:49.395 --> 00:13:51.798

[THUNDER SHOCK MOVE]

00:13:58.137 --> 00:14:00.306
Heliolisk, dodge it!

00:14:00.306 --> 00:14:01.808
Use Electro Ball.

00:14:01.808 --> 00:14:03.076
[ELECTRO BALL MOVE]

00:14:03.076 --> 00:14:05.411
Now use Dragon Tail
for your counterattack.

00:14:05.411 --> 00:14:08.247
[DRAGON TAIL MOVE]

00:14:09.148 --> 00:14:11.084
Magneton, Tackle.

00:14:11.084 --> 00:14:13.653
[TACKLE MOVE]

00:14:13.653 --> 00:14:14.754

Heliolisk.

00:14:20.660 --> 00:14:23.062
Huh? Huh?

00:14:23.062 --> 00:14:24.731
[STRUGGLING]

00:14:24.731 --> 00:14:27.400
Doctor Belmondo
and Dark Clembot!

00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:30.403
You two are coming with
me. I have a few questions.

00:14:30.403 --> 00:14:31.671
[chuckles]

00:14:31.671 --> 00:14:34.073
Do it, Magneton!

00:14:34.073 --> 00:14:35.408
'Use Flash Cannon!'

00:14:35.408 --> 00:14:36.776
[FLASH CANNON MOVE]

00:14:36.776 --> 00:14:38.845
Dodge and use Parabolic Charge!

00:14:38.845 --> 00:14:41.047
[DODGING]

00:14:41.047 --> 00:14:42.148
[PARABOLIC CHARGE MOVE]

00:14:42.148 --> 00:14:44.283
Use Tackle, Magneton!

00:14:44.283 --> 00:14:45.785
[TACKLE MOVE]

00:14:45.785 --> 00:14:48.187
[PAINED]

00:14:48.187 --> 00:14:49.989
Heliolisk, no!

00:14:49.989 --> 00:14:52.358
[EXERTION]

00:14:52.358 --> 00:14:55.361
You're slow, Magneton.
Pick up the pace.

00:14:55.361 --> 00:14:57.463
Alright. This battle is over!

00:14:57.463 --> 00:14:58.698
Over?

00:14:58.698 --> 00:15:00.199
You've already lost.

00:15:00.199 --> 00:15:02.335
Your robot couldn't care less
about the condition

00:15:02.335 --> 00:15:03.903
of your Pokémon one bit.

00:15:03.903 --> 00:15:05.738
All it cares about is winning.

00:15:05.738 --> 00:15:09.108
My Clembot always
battles alongside my Pokémon.

00:15:10.476 --> 00:15:12.211
[laughing]

00:15:12.211 --> 00:15:13.713
Oh, what a fool!

00:15:13.713 --> 00:15:16.482
The only thing that matters
in battle is getting the win.

00:15:16.482 --> 00:15:18.651
'That's how
I programmed Dark Clembot.'

00:15:18.651 --> 00:15:21.487
'And that's what makes him
the most powerful robot of all!'

00:15:21.487 --> 00:15:22.989
Wrong Belmondo.

00:15:22.989 --> 00:15:25.224
The robot who is best
at Pokémon battling

00:15:25.224 --> 00:15:27.527
cares about Pokémon
above all else.

00:15:27.527 --> 00:15:30.763
'And that definition
describes my Clembot to a tee!'

00:15:30.763 --> 00:15:35.902
He's right! You lost, Belmondo!
Just give it up already!

00:15:35.902 --> 00:15:37.170
[AGREEMENT]

00:15:37.170 --> 00:15:39.238
[grunts]
Huh?

00:15:41.073 --> 00:15:43.509
Hey Clembot,
what's wrong with you?

00:15:47.547 --> 00:15:49.348
Ah. What's with Clembot?

00:15:49.348 --> 00:15:50.616
[CONCERNED]

00:15:50.616 --> 00:15:52.652
[laughing]

00:15:52.652 --> 00:15:54.987
What's with Clembot
is what's with us.

00:15:54.987 --> 00:15:57.690
We've got a big magnet
and that's a plus.

00:15:57.690 --> 00:15:59.959
To protect the world
from devastation.

00:15:59.959 --> 00:16:02.829
To unite all people
within our nation!

00:16:02.829 --> 00:16:05.798
To denounce the evils
of no attraction.

00:16:05.798 --> 00:16:09.068
To extend our reach
with magnetic action!

00:16:09.068 --> 00:16:10.136
Jessie.

00:16:10.136 --> 00:16:11.504
And James.

00:16:11.504 --> 00:16:14.807
Team Rocket blasts off
at the speed of light.

00:16:14.807 --> 00:16:17.610
Surrender now or prepare
for an isotropic fight.

00:16:17.610 --> 00:16:19.378
Meowth, that's right!

00:16:23.316 --> 00:16:24.884
Team Rocket? Again?

00:16:26.519 --> 00:16:29.922
We attract technically advanced
robots and repel Twerps.

00:16:29.922 --> 00:16:32.425
At Team Rocket,
naturally naughty behavior

00:16:32.425 --> 00:16:33.693
is a way of life.

00:16:33.693 --> 00:16:35.895
And with this magnet,
we can grab both of those

00:16:35.895 --> 00:16:37.096
metal heads at once.

00:16:37.096 --> 00:16:38.631
What?

00:16:38.631 --> 00:16:40.199
[grunting]

00:16:40.199 --> 00:16:43.936
[screaming]
Ah.

00:16:46.506 --> 00:16:48.007
It's Blaziken Mask!

00:16:48.007 --> 00:16:49.342
And Mega Blaziken.

00:16:49.342 --> 00:16:52.512
‐ Ash!
‐ 'Alexa!'

00:16:52.512 --> 00:16:54.814
‐ It's Blaziken Mask. See?
‐ Yeah.

00:16:54.814 --> 00:16:57.617
I won't let you cause
any trouble for this city!

00:16:57.617 --> 00:16:59.919
[AGREEMENT]

00:16:59.919 --> 00:17:01.854
Use Flare Blitz!

00:17:01.854 --> 00:17:04.824
[EXERTION]/[FLARE BLITZ MOVE]

00:17:04.824 --> 00:17:06.559
[gasps]

00:17:06.559 --> 00:17:08.561
Use Blaze Kick. Now!

00:17:08.561 --> 00:17:09.595
[BLAZE KICK MOVE]

00:17:09.595 --> 00:17:10.763
[screaming]

00:17:12.331 --> 00:17:13.366
We're blasting..

00:17:13.366 --> 00:17:14.400
Off..

00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:15.868
Again!

00:17:20.339 --> 00:17:24.210
Sorry to interrupt your
activities. Resume, Clemont.

00:17:26.112 --> 00:17:27.680
[EXCITED]

00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:30.349
Good job, Clembot.
Get a good rest.

00:17:30.349 --> 00:17:33.953
You deserve it after all.
You too, Heliolisk!

00:17:33.953 --> 00:17:36.656
You leave me with no choice.

00:17:36.656 --> 00:17:39.492
[APPEARING]

00:17:39.492 --> 00:17:42.061
‐ Out of the way.
‐ Please, I want to handle this.

00:17:42.061 --> 00:17:43.362
But wait..

00:17:43.362 --> 00:17:46.098
He'll be just fine.
Clemont knows what to do.

00:17:46.098 --> 00:17:48.768
Alright, Luxray, let's go!

00:17:48.768 --> 00:17:51.437
[APPEARING]

00:17:51.437 --> 00:17:53.439
Magnezone! Zap Cannon!

00:17:53.439 --> 00:17:55.741
[ZAP CANNON MOVE]

00:17:55.741 --> 00:17:58.511
Quick, Luxray! Dodge it! Go!

00:17:58.511 --> 00:18:00.046
Use Wild Charge!

00:18:00.046 --> 00:18:01.747
[WILD CHARGE MOVE]

00:18:01.747 --> 00:18:03.983
[PAINED]

00:18:05.952 --> 00:18:09.922
What do you think you're doing?
Hurry and get up! Electro Ball!

00:18:09.922 --> 00:18:12.158
[ELECTRO BALL MOVE]

00:18:12.158 --> 00:18:14.827
Now, Luxray, hit that back
with Swift!

00:18:14.827 --> 00:18:17.296
[SWIFT MOVE]

00:18:18.764 --> 00:18:22.435
Hit that back with Tackle!
And do it right now!

00:18:22.435 --> 00:18:23.469
[TACKLE MOVE]

00:18:23.469 --> 00:18:24.637
Not again!

00:18:24.637 --> 00:18:26.706
Terrible.

00:18:26.706 --> 00:18:28.941
Luxray, dodge it and use Swift!

00:18:28.941 --> 00:18:32.111
[DODGING]/[SWIFT MOVE]

00:18:32.111 --> 00:18:33.679
[PAINED]

00:18:35.014 --> 00:18:37.683
[DAZED]

00:18:37.683 --> 00:18:39.885
Huh? Ah.

00:18:39.885 --> 00:18:41.320
I know your style.

00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:43.756
I learned it from watching
Dark Clembot's battle.

00:18:43.756 --> 00:18:46.058
That's how I predicted
your moves.

00:18:46.058 --> 00:18:49.629
'From now on, I suggest you
treat your robot and Pokémon'

00:18:49.629 --> 00:18:51.464
'with more respect.'

00:18:51.464 --> 00:18:53.232
I knew you could beat them!

00:18:53.232 --> 00:18:55.267
BONNIE
What a cool big brother.

00:18:55.267 --> 00:18:57.269
[EXCITED]

00:18:57.269 --> 00:19:00.973
OFFICER JENNY Doctor Belmondo,
you're under arrest.

00:19:00.973 --> 00:19:02.875
Ah.

00:19:02.875 --> 00:19:05.478
‐ Ash! Clemont!
‐ Huh?

00:19:05.478 --> 00:19:08.147
You two are going to have
a Gym battle, aren't you?

00:19:08.147 --> 00:19:09.682
‐ Huh?
‐ Hey!

00:19:09.682 --> 00:19:11.117
How did you know about that?

00:19:11.117 --> 00:19:13.753
I know everything
that goes on in this city.

00:19:13.753 --> 00:19:15.287
[AGREEMENT]

00:19:15.287 --> 00:19:16.522
[EXERTION]

00:19:16.522 --> 00:19:20.493
‐ Good luck to both of you!
‐ Huh. Wait!

00:19:20.493 --> 00:19:22.895
[EXERTION]

00:19:22.895 --> 00:19:24.864
Ah. Slow down!

00:19:24.864 --> 00:19:27.900
He must still be around here.
Let's go!

00:19:32.538 --> 00:19:36.008
Clemont. I'm looking forward
to your Gym battle.

00:19:36.008 --> 00:19:39.045
It's you against Ash.
Man‐to‐man.

00:19:39.045 --> 00:19:41.580
It's time you fulfill
the promise you've made to him.

00:19:41.580 --> 00:19:44.583
Give it your all.
Everything you've got.

00:19:44.583 --> 00:19:46.318
[AGREEMENT]

00:19:55.261 --> 00:19:58.297
Now, I want you to eat
as much as you like.

00:19:58.297 --> 00:20:00.266
There's plenty more
where that came from.

00:20:00.266 --> 00:20:04.804
ASH/SERENA/CLEMONT/BONNIE
Thanks so much for the food!

00:20:04.804 --> 00:20:06.238
Yeah!
It's yummy.

00:20:06.238 --> 00:20:09.241
[EXCITED]

00:20:09.241 --> 00:20:11.977
Wow, they wrote about
what happened yesterday.

00:20:11.977 --> 00:20:14.714
The Lumiose Gym's Clembot
was proven innocent.

00:20:14.714 --> 00:20:16.515
And for nabbing
the real culprits

00:20:16.515 --> 00:20:18.718
Clembot was given full honors.

00:20:18.718 --> 00:20:20.419
Ooh, let's see.

00:20:20.419 --> 00:20:23.022
That really sounds like Alexa
wrote that article.

00:20:23.022 --> 00:20:25.324
Say. Serena, you were right.

00:20:25.324 --> 00:20:29.128
This is amazing!
And look at you. You're famous!

00:20:29.128 --> 00:20:31.597
Stop it.
You're embarrassing me.

00:20:31.597 --> 00:20:33.666
Now, we can finally rest easy.

00:20:33.666 --> 00:20:35.167
Then is today the day?

00:20:35.167 --> 00:20:38.337
Yup. Time for our Gym battle.

00:20:38.337 --> 00:20:40.940
NARRATOR Although Clembot was
arrested for crimes

00:20:40.940 --> 00:20:43.442
it didn't commit our heroes
figured out

00:20:43.442 --> 00:20:45.644
the identity of the
true culprits.

00:20:45.644 --> 00:20:48.848
Now, Ash and Clemont's Gym
battle can finally

00:20:48.848 --> 00:20:53.119
get underway, as our
heroes' journey continues.

00:20:57.289 --> 00:21:00.226
