Huh?
What happened?

00:16:31.424 --> 00:16:34.093
‐ Huh?
‐ Well, what's wrong?

00:16:34.093 --> 00:16:36.062
‐ Is it broken?
‐ 'No.'

00:16:36.062 --> 00:16:38.297
‐ Huh?
‐ I'm afraid, no.

00:16:38.297 --> 00:16:40.333
Tyrantrum already has a Trainer.

00:16:40.333 --> 00:16:41.601
Ah.

00:16:41.601 --> 00:16:42.635
Huh?

00:16:42.635 --> 00:16:44.871
[engine revving]

00:16:45.905 --> 00:16:47.573
Tyrantrum.

00:16:49.208 --> 00:16:50.776
‐ Ah‐ha!
‐ So there you are.

00:16:50.776 --> 00:16:52.345
Who are you?

00:16:52.345 --> 00:16:53.779
You see, we're both scientists

00:16:53.779 --> 00:16:55.982
from the Pokémon Fossil
Research Lab.

00:16:55.982 --> 00:16:58.484
Pokémon Fossil Research Lab?

00:16:58.484 --> 00:17:01.354
Huh? Huh.

00:17:01.354 --> 00:17:02.622
Ah.

00:17:02.622 --> 00:17:03.956
Of course.

00:17:03.956 --> 00:17:06.659
I thought it was strange
to see a wild Tyrunt.

00:17:06.659 --> 00:17:09.695
That means you're the research
lab's Pokémon?

00:17:09.695 --> 00:17:11.831
[AGREEMENT]

00:17:13.132 --> 00:17:15.535
SCIENTIST A 'I see.
So that's what happened.'

00:17:15.535 --> 00:17:18.538
You took it upon yourself
to take care of Tyrantrum.

00:17:18.538 --> 00:17:22.308
SERENA She did. Bonnie is the
one who did everything.

00:17:22.308 --> 00:17:24.877
SCIENTIST A
'Thank you so much, Bonnie.'

00:17:24.877 --> 00:17:27.713
Let us give you a tour of the
Pokémon Fossil Research Lab

00:17:27.713 --> 00:17:28.915
as our thanks.

00:17:28.915 --> 00:17:31.651
Yeah?
That sounds like a lot of fun.

00:17:31.651 --> 00:17:33.386
[EXCITED]

00:17:33.386 --> 00:17:35.721
I bet there's gonna be
lots of Pokémon.

00:17:35.721 --> 00:17:38.658
Hey, Bonnie?

00:17:38.658 --> 00:17:40.993
Let's all go
to the Research Lab.

00:17:42.194 --> 00:17:43.663
'Okay?'

00:17:49.936 --> 00:17:53.406
‐ Whoa. It's huge.
‐ Pikachu.

00:17:53.406 --> 00:17:56.475
Yeah. So this is where you
restore fossils into Pokémon?

00:17:56.475 --> 00:17:59.211
‐ Yes, that's correct.
‐ Incredible.

00:17:59.211 --> 00:18:02.481
‐ Don't you think so, Bonnie?
‐ Hm.

00:18:02.481 --> 00:18:05.451
[PROUD]

00:18:08.521 --> 00:18:10.356
Aerodactyl. Whoa.

00:18:10.356 --> 00:18:11.524
[AMAZED]

00:18:11.524 --> 00:18:14.627
Oh, wow!
What a wonderful opportunity.

00:18:14.627 --> 00:18:17.396
‐ Isn't it great to see them?
‐ Hmpf.

00:18:17.396 --> 00:18:20.733
Huh? Bonnie, look at that!
It's a Kabuto.

00:18:20.733 --> 00:18:22.201
[laughing]

00:18:22.201 --> 00:18:25.705
I can't believe they're all
real. Incredible stuff.

00:18:25.705 --> 00:18:27.974
Check it out.
You'll love what you see.

00:18:27.974 --> 00:18:29.342
[ENCOURAGING]

00:18:30.643 --> 00:18:33.379
And this area here
is where all of our Tyrunt

00:18:33.379 --> 00:18:34.680
and Tyrantrum live.

00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:36.415
SERENA So they're all
Tyrantrum's friends?

00:18:36.415 --> 00:18:39.719
Right. They're all so close,
they're like family.

00:18:41.087 --> 00:18:43.889

Oh..

Now, Bonnie, I think it's time
to say goodbye.

00:18:51.230 --> 00:18:52.565
Hey, Bonnie?

00:18:55.301 --> 00:18:57.536
[screaming]

00:18:58.804 --> 00:19:00.873

Brushing your teeth's good
for you.

00:19:13.052 --> 00:19:15.554
Feel good? I'm glad.

[AFFECTIONATE]

00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:29.802
Now, that you're a Tyrantrum

00:19:29.802 --> 00:19:31.871
you're way too big
to act like a baby.

00:19:31.871 --> 00:19:34.540
It's time to be a grown up.

00:19:34.540 --> 00:19:36.308

BONNIE 'Don't cause any trouble
for the scientists, okay?'

00:19:41.681 --> 00:19:43.616
Tyrantrum really likes
to be brushed

00:19:43.616 --> 00:19:45.785
so I think I should
give this to you.

00:19:45.785 --> 00:19:46.952
Thank you, Bonnie.

00:19:46.952 --> 00:19:48.988
We'll be sure
to use it all the time.

00:19:48.988 --> 00:19:52.491
Bye‐bye.
Take care, Tyrantrum.

00:19:54.326 --> 00:19:58.898
No, no. You belong here
at the lab. Don't follow me.

Oh, Bonnie.

I know.
Don't worry, I know.

00:20:14.013 --> 00:20:16.248
Bye‐bye, now.

Pokémon, there are hellos

00:20:25.558 --> 00:20:28.227
in life and there are good‐byes
as well.

And so, with fond memories
of Tyrunt and Tyrantrum

00:20:32.031 --> 00:20:34.166

Take care, Tyrantrum.
