It's four horns function

'radar system, picking up many
different scents and noises.'

It's using Dragon Breath.

00:17:29.248 --> 00:17:31.551
Yes. You learned a new move.

You were great, Chespin.

00:18:08.421 --> 00:18:10.523
Okay. Let's find Team Rocket.

00:18:10.523 --> 00:18:11.958
‐ Right.
‐ Right.

00:18:15.227 --> 00:18:16.395

Hold on, you want us

No thanks. Showtime's over.

Give it up now.

00:18:34.213 --> 00:18:36.649
Now how did those
tricky Twerps escape anyway?

00:18:36.649 --> 00:18:37.717
Uh..

00:18:37.717 --> 00:18:39.919
The Twerp Pokémon
are out as well.

00:18:39.919 --> 00:18:42.521
And, Goomy evolved
into a Sliggoo, too.
