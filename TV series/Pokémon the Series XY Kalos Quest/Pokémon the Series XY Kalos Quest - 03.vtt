another Water type

a much easier time

'Got it!'

00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:36.522
ASH
'Now, Dragalge, use Acid!'

00:17:36.522 --> 00:17:38.558
[ACID MOVE]

00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:43.529
Great, that should prevent
anymore water

00:17:43.529 --> 00:17:44.931
from flooding the ship.

00:17:44.931 --> 00:17:47.066
The structure should
stop collapsing, too.

00:17:47.066 --> 00:17:48.067
‐ Alright!
‐ Alright!

00:17:48.067 --> 00:17:49.669
[EXCITED]

00:17:49.669 --> 00:17:51.003
EDDY
'Great job.'

00:17:51.003 --> 00:17:53.272
‐ 'That was a tough one.'
‐ Eddy!

00:17:53.272 --> 00:17:55.074
But you're all safe and sound.

00:17:55.074 --> 00:17:57.743
And that's what matters
to me the most.

00:17:57.743 --> 00:18:01.013
'It's time. The whirlpools
are going to appear again soon.'

00:18:01.013 --> 00:18:02.214
LINDSEY
'Right!'

00:18:07.787 --> 00:18:10.022
Success!
Have treasure, will travel!

00:18:10.022 --> 00:18:11.591
[AFFIRMATIVE]

00:18:11.591 --> 00:18:13.526
Yeah, now we'll have
balanced books

00:18:13.526 --> 00:18:15.561
'and be off those tenterhooks!'

00:18:15.561 --> 00:18:17.330
[EXERTION]

00:18:17.330 --> 00:18:21.067
Hm! Huh? Uh,
is something swirling out there?

00:18:21.067 --> 00:18:23.202
‐ Huh?
‐ Eh?

00:18:23.202 --> 00:18:24.937
‐ Over there, too!
‐ Uh‐oh.

00:18:24.937 --> 00:18:27.807
JESSIE
'There's another one! Ah!'

00:18:27.807 --> 00:18:30.409
[all screaming]

00:18:30.409 --> 00:18:32.211
JESSIE 'We're spinning
faster and faster!'

00:18:32.211 --> 00:18:34.513
MEOWTH 'I'm getting
dizzier and dizzier!'

00:18:34.513 --> 00:18:37.617
[screaming]

00:18:37.617 --> 00:18:39.452
JESSIE
'We dropped the safe!'

00:18:39.452 --> 00:18:42.121
‐ Butterfingers!
‐ The scent of regret lingers.

00:18:42.121 --> 00:18:43.856
TEAM ROCKET
We're blasting off again!

WOBBUFFET
[AFFIRMATIVE]

00:18:51.430 --> 00:18:54.266
Uh, where are
Skrelp and Froakie?

00:18:56.502 --> 00:18:58.771
[WORRIED]

00:18:58.771 --> 00:19:00.106
Oh, no!

00:19:00.106 --> 00:19:02.675
Even Water types
can't withstand a whirlpool.

00:19:02.675 --> 00:19:03.876
Now what?

00:19:03.876 --> 00:19:05.811
Froakie, you've got to jump!

00:19:05.811 --> 00:19:07.279
[WORRIED]

00:19:07.279 --> 00:19:10.249
[WORRIED]

00:19:10.249 --> 00:19:13.352
[EXERTION]

00:19:19.358 --> 00:19:21.060
Now, Froakie, big jump!

00:19:21.060 --> 00:19:24.163
[EXERTION]

00:19:25.398 --> 00:19:27.667
Ah..

00:19:27.667 --> 00:19:29.402
[giggles]

00:19:29.402 --> 00:19:30.403
Froakie.

00:19:30.403 --> 00:19:31.404
[HAPPY]

00:19:31.404 --> 00:19:32.672
‐ Great!
‐ They did it!

00:19:32.672 --> 00:19:33.806
[EXCITED]

00:19:33.806 --> 00:19:35.474
‐ Hm.
‐ Thank goodness!

00:19:35.474 --> 00:19:36.642
Perfect!

00:19:36.642 --> 00:19:38.411
Froakie, you were awesome!

00:19:38.411 --> 00:19:40.413
Skrelp, you were awesome, too!

00:19:40.413 --> 00:19:41.947
[EXCITED]

00:19:41.947 --> 00:19:43.716
[HAPPY]

00:19:47.987 --> 00:19:50.890
ASH
Bye, Skrelp! Bye, Dragalge!

00:19:50.890 --> 00:19:51.957
SERENA
Take care of your home!

00:19:51.957 --> 00:19:53.693
And all of those friends
of yours!

00:19:53.693 --> 00:19:55.361
PIKACHU
[EXCITED]

00:19:55.361 --> 00:19:57.463
[AGREEMENT]

00:19:59.699 --> 00:20:02.835
‐ Take good care, Skrelp.
‐ Hope we see you again!

00:20:02.835 --> 00:20:05.337
[AGREEMENT]

00:20:05.337 --> 00:20:07.073
Happily we were able
to figure out

00:20:07.073 --> 00:20:08.708
which current
brought the Cussler

00:20:08.708 --> 00:20:11.243
and successfully pinpoint
its location, too.

00:20:11.243 --> 00:20:12.745
What surprised me the most

00:20:12.745 --> 00:20:15.247
was seeing all those Pokémon
living together.

00:20:15.247 --> 00:20:17.083
That was some discovery.

00:20:17.083 --> 00:20:19.552
And Skrelp's okay,
thanks to your jump!

00:20:19.552 --> 00:20:21.020
You're such a cool Pokémon!

00:20:21.020 --> 00:20:22.288
[AGREEMENT]

00:20:22.288 --> 00:20:24.423
The height of that jump
was just incredible!

00:20:24.423 --> 00:20:26.625
Wow! You should be
really proud of yourself!

00:20:26.625 --> 00:20:28.694
That was some jump.

00:20:31.297 --> 00:20:32.698
[AGREEMENT]

00:20:32.698 --> 00:20:37.002
Hey, maybe we could use that
in our Gym battle against Grant.

00:20:37.002 --> 00:20:38.838
That's it! Of course we can!

00:20:38.838 --> 00:20:40.806
[HAPPY]

00:20:40.806 --> 00:20:43.743
NARRATOR And so Froakie's
brilliance rescued Skrelp

00:20:43.743 --> 00:20:46.345
from the whirlpool
and also gave Ash an idea

00:20:46.345 --> 00:20:48.748
for his battle
at the Cyllage City Gym

00:20:48.748 --> 00:20:52.017
the next stop
on our heroes' journey!

00:20:56.922 --> 00:21:00.092
