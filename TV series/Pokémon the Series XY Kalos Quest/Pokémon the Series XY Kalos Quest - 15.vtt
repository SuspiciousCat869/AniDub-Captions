Is there a Pokémon Center?

I don't see anything

It may be boring

We know someone like Jessie

‐ Doctor, please help.

00:10:49.215 --> 00:10:51.384
Something happened to Dedenne
and it's in trouble.

of that Pokémon hunter.

ASH/SERENA/BONNIE
A Pokémon hunter?

00:11:05.665 --> 00:11:08.101
He's a bad guy
who finds rare Pokémon

00:11:08.101 --> 00:11:10.503
and then sells them
to make a profit.

‐ Is Dedenne gonna be alright?
‐ Don't worry.

00:11:13.573 --> 00:11:15.842
I'll drain off
the excess electricity.

00:11:15.842 --> 00:11:17.043

‐ Dedenne. Thank you so much.
‐ Sure.

A few oran berries will help
Dedenne get its strength back.

00:11:29.355 --> 00:11:31.357
I'll go get some
from the garden.

00:11:33.026 --> 00:11:35.662

I'm quitting Team Rocket

for herself maybe we shouldn't
stand in her way.

from Jessie.

Then that must mean
you already..

Yes, I know I'm asking
a lot from you.

00:14:59.432 --> 00:15:02.502
But, please, help me.

00:15:02.502 --> 00:15:05.772
If that guy's a Pokémon hunter,
we can't just do nothing.
