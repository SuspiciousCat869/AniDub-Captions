You can count on it.

00:14:57.764 --> 00:14:59.465
Goodra! I choose you!

Okay, let's do this!

00:15:04.771 --> 00:15:06.372
CLEMONT Even Pikachu couldn't
win

00:15:06.372 --> 00:15:08.341
on this electric
battlefield.

00:15:08.341 --> 00:15:11.110
Goodra must still
feel that paralysis.

00:15:11.110 --> 00:15:13.079
We'll just see what happens.

00:15:14.113 --> 00:15:16.182
[Ash thinking]
Clemont's right.

00:15:19.352 --> 00:15:22.588
Ah, so we'll make
the battlefield work for us.

00:15:22.588 --> 00:15:24.891
‐ Huh!
‐ Use Rain Dance!

CLEMONT
Huh!

00:15:35.568 --> 00:15:37.570
Of course, you made it rain

00:15:37.570 --> 00:15:39.539
to eliminate
all the electricity.

Clever boy.

00:15:41.641 --> 00:15:44.076
I'm afraid Clemont
got outsmarted on that one.

How come?

'When it rains, it heals
Goodra's status condition.'

00:15:52.385 --> 00:15:54.821
So you're saying
Ash planned for that?

00:15:54.821 --> 00:15:56.222
It would seem so.

00:15:56.222 --> 00:15:59.459
Now, Goodra, this is
the perfect battlefield for you!

00:15:59.459 --> 00:16:01.527
So give it
everything you've got!

with my carefully laid plans.

00:16:09.635 --> 00:16:11.337
But I was waiting for this.

00:16:12.405 --> 00:16:15.141

I'm going to play it by ear!

This will be all over soon.

What's Ash up to?

00:16:35.394 --> 00:16:38.264
I'm surprised he's taking
such a passive stance.

We'll just beat you before
your energy is released.

00:16:46.305 --> 00:16:48.274
