And now, it's Ash's turn
to face this

00:00:12.613 --> 00:00:15.182
Fairy‐type Trainer
in a Gym battle.

00:00:15.182 --> 00:00:18.118
Ash's sixth Kalos Gym badge
is on the line.

00:00:18.118 --> 00:00:20.487

Hey, Sawyer?

Have you ever watched
a Gym battle before?

00:00:33.934 --> 00:00:35.669
No. It's my first time.

Have you figured out
how to deal

00:00:45.445 --> 00:00:47.014
with Valerie's Fairy‐types?

00:00:47.014 --> 00:00:49.783
Judging from her challenge
yesterday, it's clear

00:00:49.783 --> 00:00:52.486
there's a lot we don't know
about her battling techniques.

00:00:52.486 --> 00:00:54.054

Ash will be fine!

00:00:57.724 --> 00:01:00.327
Ash and his Pokémon
have always worked together

00:01:00.327 --> 00:01:02.629
which is the key to winning
Gym badges.

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:04.765
That's why he'll be able
to beat Valerie!

I've always

Take a nice rest.

00:09:06.413 --> 00:09:09.382
Fletchinder hung in there
and beat her first Pokémon.

00:09:09.382 --> 00:09:12.218
Hmm, but I wonder
what her next one is?

00:09:12.218 --> 00:09:13.586
She's a Gym Leader.

00:09:13.586 --> 00:09:15.422
Ash still can't let
his guard down.

00:09:15.422 --> 00:09:18.158
There's still a very tough
battle ahead.

00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:21.194
Be warned.

00:09:21.194 --> 00:09:23.763

this time!

[READY]

00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:28.768
There's that Spritzee.

00:09:28.768 --> 00:09:30.103
Spritzee.

We saw Spritzee's Dazzling Gleam
yesterday

but we still don't know about
its other moves.

00:09:39.446 --> 00:09:40.814
Hm.

00:09:40.814 --> 00:09:44.417
Are you ready, Ash?
It's your move again!

00:09:44.417 --> 00:09:47.754
You heard her.
Fletchinder, let's go!

00:09:47.754 --> 00:09:49.756
Fletchinder, use Steel Wing!

[STEEL WING MOVE]

00:09:53.426 --> 00:09:55.395

00:10:40.874 --> 00:10:42.775
Surprised you, didn't we?

00:10:42.775 --> 00:10:44.677
Valerie's using Trick Room!

00:10:44.677 --> 00:10:46.913
And if so,
that can only mean one thing.

00:10:46.913 --> 00:10:49.415
Valerie's totally serious
about this battle!

00:10:49.415 --> 00:10:51.017
SAWYER
I've never seen it before.

00:10:51.017 --> 00:10:53.019
So this is what
they call Trick Room.

00:10:53.019 --> 00:10:55.421
Hey, is this a Fairy‐type move?

00:10:55.421 --> 00:10:57.257
It's a Psychic‐type move.

00:10:57.257 --> 00:10:59.459
And quite a troublesome one
at that!

00:10:59.459 --> 00:11:01.461
[CONCERN]

00:11:01.461 --> 00:11:03.530
Okay , Fletchinder, speed it up!

00:11:03.530 --> 00:11:04.564
Now, use Flame Charge!

00:11:04.564 --> 00:11:05.899
[FLAME CHARGE MOVE]

00:11:05.899 --> 00:11:08.067

'Hey, what's going on?'

00:11:12.071 --> 00:11:14.073
It's not going any faster!

00:11:14.073 --> 00:11:16.543
Normally , Flame Charge
is a move that will increase

00:11:16.543 --> 00:11:19.445
its user's speed,
but the challenge is when

00:11:19.445 --> 00:11:22.549
Trick Room is being used,
the faster a Pokémon goes

00:11:22.549 --> 00:11:24.317
'the slower it actually is!'

00:11:24.317 --> 00:11:27.987
SERENA 'So Ash called it
not knowing that?'

00:11:27.987 --> 00:11:29.822
But what are they gonna do now?

00:11:29.822 --> 00:11:31.524
It's dodging everything.

00:11:31.524 --> 00:11:34.027
Trick Room creates
a mysterious space.

00:11:34.027 --> 00:11:36.162
So even though Spritzee's
normally slower

00:11:36.162 --> 00:11:37.730
than Fletchinder,
does it turn into

00:11:37.730 --> 00:11:40.166
the faster Pokémon
in Trick Room?

00:11:40.166 --> 00:11:42.168
CLEMONT
That's right.

00:11:42.168 --> 00:11:44.904

What in the world
could Ash be thinking?

00:12:19.839 --> 00:12:22.008
I'll bet you that
he's got a strategy.

00:12:22.008 --> 00:12:23.776
‐ Huh?
‐ Huh?

00:12:23.776 --> 00:12:27.080
I know you can do it!
Hang in there!

00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:30.383
Do your best and keep using
Flame Charge, go!

00:12:30.383 --> 00:12:33.253
I wonder what trick
he's got up his sleeve.

00:12:33.253 --> 00:12:34.587

Hang in there, Fletchinder!

00:12:47.533 --> 00:12:49.369

00:12:55.642 --> 00:12:58.511

‐ Of course!

00:13:01.848 --> 00:13:03.950
Now, I understand
what Ash is up to!

00:13:03.950 --> 00:13:06.719
He kept on using Flame Charge
so Fletchinder could attack

00:13:06.719 --> 00:13:09.322
'at high speed as soon as
Trick Room disappeared!'

00:13:09.322 --> 00:13:11.324

But I must say

00:13:40.053 --> 00:13:42.789
your multiple Flame Charges
were a good idea.

00:13:42.789 --> 00:13:46.626
It's been a while since
I've been surprised like that.

00:13:46.626 --> 00:13:48.061
That Moonblast.

00:13:48.061 --> 00:13:50.563
That was another dangerous
hidden fang.

00:13:50.563 --> 00:13:52.465
Ash took much too long.

00:13:52.465 --> 00:13:54.867
And he paid a heavy price
for doing that.

Okay, Hawlucha's
a Fighting and Flying‐type.

very effective on Spritzee.

00:17:06.559 --> 00:17:08.127
Never seen that before!

00:17:08.127 --> 00:17:10.396
What an awesome X‐Scissor!

00:17:10.396 --> 00:17:13.866
‐ They broke through..
‐ Trick Room!

00:17:13.866 --> 00:17:14.967
You did it, Hawlucha!

00:17:14.967 --> 00:17:16.002
[PROUD]

00:17:16.002 --> 00:17:17.870
Unbelievable.

00:17:17.870 --> 00:17:20.239
CLEMONT 'Even if a Bug‐type move
like X‐Scissor'

00:17:20.239 --> 00:17:22.141
'isn't effective against
a Fairy‐type'

00:17:22.141 --> 00:17:24.243
'it is effective against
Trick Room'

00:17:24.243 --> 00:17:25.978
'which is a Psychic‐type move.'

00:17:25.978 --> 00:17:28.381
'And that's the chance
Ash took!'

00:17:28.381 --> 00:17:30.016
Ash is amazing!

00:17:30.016 --> 00:17:32.285
That's his battling style,
alright.

00:17:32.285 --> 00:17:34.887
We never know what Ash
is gonna come up with next.

00:17:34.887 --> 00:17:36.589
[AGREE]

00:17:36.589 --> 00:17:39.592
I wonder if I can do that too?

00:17:39.592 --> 00:17:42.595
I wanted to destroy that
Trick Room with X‐Scissor.

00:17:42.595 --> 00:17:44.230
And that's just what I did!

00:17:44.230 --> 00:17:46.933
You're great at communicating
with your Pokémon.

00:17:46.933 --> 00:17:49.068
You and Hawlucha
are a perfect match!

00:17:49.068 --> 00:17:50.469
[TIRED]

00:17:50.469 --> 00:17:52.471
Spritzee! Let's do this!

00:17:52.471 --> 00:17:54.640
Okay! Now, use Flying Press!

00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:56.576
[FLYING PRESS MOVE]

00:17:57.910 --> 00:17:59.078
[PAINED]

00:17:59.078 --> 00:18:01.213
Spritzee,
don't let it get too close.

00:18:01.213 --> 00:18:03.115
Moonblast!

00:18:03.716 --> 00:18:05.351
[MOONVLAST MOVE]

00:18:05.885 --> 00:18:07.520
Dodge it, quick!

00:18:08.988 --> 00:18:10.690
Now, High Jump Kick!

00:18:10.690 --> 00:18:12.391
[HIGH JUMP MOVE]

00:18:15.828 --> 00:18:17.363
[PAINED]

00:18:28.007 --> 00:18:29.909
[all gasping]

00:18:32.612 --> 00:18:34.480
Spritzee is unable to battle!

00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:35.881
Hawlucha is the winner!

00:18:35.881 --> 00:18:39.185
So the victor
is Ash of Pallett Town!

00:18:39.185 --> 00:18:40.353
Alright!

00:18:40.353 --> 00:18:42.054
[HAPPY]

00:18:43.923 --> 00:18:45.224
Hawlucha, that was great!

00:18:45.224 --> 00:18:46.325
[EXCITED]

00:18:46.325 --> 00:18:48.628
I just can't believe
Valerie lost.

00:18:48.628 --> 00:18:50.830
I haven't seen that in so long.

00:18:53.332 --> 00:18:56.035
Spritzee?

00:18:56.035 --> 00:18:58.904
[speaking in foreign language]

00:18:58.904 --> 00:19:00.706
You gave it your best effort.

00:19:00.706 --> 00:19:03.809
I'm so very proud of you
and Sylveon as well.

00:19:06.912 --> 00:19:09.015
That was truly well done.

00:19:09.015 --> 00:19:11.584
I haven't been that inspired
in a while.

00:19:12.685 --> 00:19:13.786
‐ Ash, you did it!
‐ Yay!

00:19:13.786 --> 00:19:15.621
‐ Hawlucha!
‐ Great!

00:19:15.621 --> 00:19:17.657
What an amazing battle.

00:19:17.657 --> 00:19:19.825
I'll be sure to make
a note of this experience!

00:19:19.825 --> 00:19:21.060
[AGREE]

00:19:23.963 --> 00:19:26.632
Ash, you know how a Trainer's
heart becomes one

00:19:26.632 --> 00:19:28.334
with their Pokémon,
when they're backed into

00:19:28.334 --> 00:19:30.736
a corner during a battle.

00:19:30.736 --> 00:19:33.372
I'm wondering.
Why is that?

00:19:35.141 --> 00:19:37.810
I'm not really sure.

00:19:37.810 --> 00:19:39.512
But I do know what you mean!

00:19:39.512 --> 00:19:40.913
[chuckles]

00:19:43.149 --> 00:19:46.419
'Here's proof that you won
at the Laverre Gym.'

00:19:46.419 --> 00:19:48.621
I present you
with the Fairy Badge.

00:19:48.621 --> 00:19:51.624
‐ Congratulations.
‐ Thank you very much!

00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:56.495
[chuckles]

00:19:58.130 --> 00:19:59.432
We did it!

00:19:59.432 --> 00:20:01.233
We got the Fairy Badge!

00:20:01.233 --> 00:20:03.402
[PROUD]

00:20:08.207 --> 00:20:09.942
That's wonderful, Ash!

00:20:09.942 --> 00:20:13.012
Fletchinder and Hawlucha
battled really really hard!

00:20:13.012 --> 00:20:15.681
And you also learned
a brand‐new battling strategy!

00:20:15.681 --> 00:20:17.416
The Trick Room Breaker!

00:20:17.416 --> 00:20:19.485
Wow, Ash!
You were so cool!

00:20:19.485 --> 00:20:21.787
I really wanna be able
to battle just like you!

00:20:21.787 --> 00:20:24.090
I've got to know
how you can battle like that.

00:20:24.090 --> 00:20:25.858
You've got to teach me!

00:20:25.858 --> 00:20:28.461
Uh, not sure
how to explain that.

00:20:28.461 --> 00:20:30.529
SAWYER 'What are you thinking
about when you're battling?'

00:20:30.529 --> 00:20:33.065
'Does Pikachu give you some kind
of advice, or something?'

00:20:33.065 --> 00:20:35.401
ASH 'It'll be easier to explain
with a battle!'

00:20:35.401 --> 00:20:37.603
SAWYER
'Yes!'

00:20:37.603 --> 00:20:40.339
NARRATOR And so, Ash
successfully overcame

00:20:40.339 --> 00:20:44.243
Spritzee's Trick Room defeating
Valerie at the Laverre Gym

00:20:44.243 --> 00:20:46.245
and winning the Fairy Badge.

00:20:46.245 --> 00:20:48.781
Now, there are only
two more badges to win

00:20:48.781 --> 00:20:51.817
before our hero gets to enter
the Kalos League

00:20:51.817 --> 00:20:55.321
as the journey continues!

00:20:56.756 --> 00:20:59.859
