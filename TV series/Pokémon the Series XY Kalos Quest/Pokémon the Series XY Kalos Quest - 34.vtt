Alright then,
I'll leave this up to you.

It's the science Twerp.

00:16:25.284 --> 00:16:27.253
Will this help Snover feel
better?

Yeah. I'm sure
it'll do the trick!

00:16:29.722 --> 00:16:31.224
Snover, eh?

00:16:31.224 --> 00:16:33.993
Might have something to do
with that Abomasnow we saw.

00:16:33.993 --> 00:16:35.995
Well, I'm ready for revenge!
