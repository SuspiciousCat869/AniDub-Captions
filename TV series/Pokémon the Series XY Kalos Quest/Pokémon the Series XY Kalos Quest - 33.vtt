Aw. You're home.

00:16:28.387 --> 00:16:30.623
So come on out, Gourgeist.

00:16:30.623 --> 00:16:32.391
[HAPPY]

00:16:33.326 --> 00:16:35.194
Gourgeist.

00:16:35.194 --> 00:16:37.497
[TOUCHED]

00:16:39.298 --> 00:16:42.401
I'm sorry.
Let's stay together forever.

00:16:42.401 --> 00:16:44.170
[TOUCHED]

00:16:44.170 --> 00:16:47.573
Mm‐hm, it doesn't get
any better than this, you know?

00:16:47.573 --> 00:16:51.277
This is the true bond
between Pokémon and Trainer.

00:16:51.277 --> 00:16:53.579
[EMOTIONAL]

00:16:53.579 --> 00:16:55.314
Guess all's well that ends well.

00:16:55.314 --> 00:16:59.252
Yes, and ending well
ends well for us.

00:16:59.252 --> 00:17:01.153
This was simply an issue between

00:17:01.153 --> 00:17:03.389
the two of them
that couldn't be resolved.

00:17:03.389 --> 00:17:06.592
Yeah, whatever.
We'll be on our way.

00:17:06.592 --> 00:17:09.662
Remember, we got a lovely meal,
so it was worthwhile.

00:17:09.662 --> 00:17:11.998
And our bond grew stronger.

00:17:11.998 --> 00:17:13.065
ASH
Stop.

00:17:13.065 --> 00:17:14.467
[all gasping]

00:17:14.467 --> 00:17:15.835
We want Chespin back.

00:17:15.835 --> 00:17:17.236
Chespin?

00:17:17.236 --> 00:17:18.271
‐ Huh?
‐ Huh?

00:17:18.271 --> 00:17:20.039
[DEVASTATED]

00:17:21.274 --> 00:17:24.510
What do you mean? I'll have you
know it belongs to..

00:17:24.510 --> 00:17:26.145
Huh?

00:17:26.145 --> 00:17:29.782
That's a fake Pikachu.
I know what that means.

00:17:31.984 --> 00:17:34.554
Alright, you need to get back.

00:17:37.223 --> 00:17:40.026
You guys.
So it was you after all.

00:17:40.026 --> 00:17:42.828
I get it.
Everything makes sense now.

00:17:44.730 --> 00:17:45.598
TEAM ROCKET
'Woo‐hoo!'

00:17:48.234 --> 00:17:50.403
Prepare for trouble,
you aren't so smart.

00:17:50.403 --> 00:17:53.306
And make it double,
we've made it an art.

00:17:53.306 --> 00:17:54.874
To protect the world
from devastation.

00:17:54.874 --> 00:17:58.344
To unite all people
within our nation.

00:17:58.344 --> 00:18:00.746
To denounce the evils
of truth and love.

00:18:00.746 --> 00:18:04.450
To extend our reach
to the stars above.

00:18:04.450 --> 00:18:07.019
‐ Jessie.
‐ And James.

00:18:07.019 --> 00:18:09.622
Team Rocket blasts off
at the speed of light.

00:18:09.622 --> 00:18:12.725
Surrender now or prepare
for one confusing fight.

00:18:12.725 --> 00:18:14.260
Meowth, that's right.

00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:15.895
[EMPHATIC]

00:18:17.797 --> 00:18:19.966
‐ Team Rocket.
‐ Team Rocket?

00:18:19.966 --> 00:18:22.234
Bad guys who steal
other people's Pokémon.

00:18:22.234 --> 00:18:25.071
Bad guys? So they were
the real villains after all.

00:18:25.071 --> 00:18:27.573
Pikachu. Iron Tail.

00:18:27.573 --> 00:18:29.342
[IRON TAIL MOVE]

00:18:32.778 --> 00:18:35.948
Heads up, you Twerps.
Listen and learn.

00:18:35.948 --> 00:18:37.883
If you depend on Mega Evolution

00:18:37.883 --> 00:18:41.153
your Pokémon will never ever
get stronger.

00:18:41.153 --> 00:18:42.455
Pay attention.

00:18:42.455 --> 00:18:44.256
It's most important
to deepen the bond

00:18:44.256 --> 00:18:47.727
between Trainer and Pokémon.
Right?

00:18:47.727 --> 00:18:50.162
I fully realize
what she said is true.

00:18:50.162 --> 00:18:52.965
But who needs it coming out
of her face?

00:18:52.965 --> 00:18:57.036
Having said that, let's deepen
our bond with Shadow Ball.

00:18:57.036 --> 00:18:58.104
Dodge it!

00:18:58.104 --> 00:19:00.172
Alright, time for Leech Seed.

00:19:00.172 --> 00:19:01.974
Quick, Pikachu, Iron Tail.

00:19:01.974 --> 00:19:04.243
[IRON TAIL MOVE]

00:19:04.243 --> 00:19:06.412
Okay, Inkay. Psybeam, go.

[PSYBEAM MOVE]

00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:12.051

Chespin! Are you alright?

00:19:22.862 --> 00:19:24.096
[ECSTATIC]

00:19:24.096 --> 00:19:25.231
That's great.

00:19:25.231 --> 00:19:27.066
No holding back now.

00:19:27.066 --> 00:19:29.602
Flamethrower, now.

00:19:29.602 --> 00:19:32.038

Blasting off
doesn't bother me this time

00:19:41.113 --> 00:19:43.215
because my Gourgeist
is here with me.

[AFFECTIONATE]

00:19:44.684 --> 00:19:46.719
Well, well, isn't that sweet.

00:19:46.719 --> 00:19:48.020
And wholesome.

I do hope all of you
will forgive me.

I was tricked.
But there's no excuse for it.

to make it up to you.'

Wow. The soup bowls
look just like Gourgeist.

Looks great.

The Gourgeist Festival

with a fireworks display.
