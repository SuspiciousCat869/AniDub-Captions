One, two, three, and four.

'One, two, and three, and four.'

Mm‐hmm.

00:16:29.522 --> 00:16:32.158
Show them how you can dance,
Eevee.

00:16:32.158 --> 00:16:34.260
Wow. I can't wait to see that.

00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:37.463
We'll just have to see if you
can keep up with our moves.

00:16:37.463 --> 00:16:41.567
Yeah. One, two, three, four,
one, two, one, two, one, two.

00:16:41.567 --> 00:16:42.802
It's so fast.

00:16:42.802 --> 00:16:43.803
Use Water Gun.

[WATER GUN MOVE]

00:16:45.404 --> 00:16:47.073

[EXERTION]

00:17:07.126 --> 00:17:08.628

You okay, Ivysaur?

00:17:17.670 --> 00:17:19.071
The battle's still on.

00:17:19.071 --> 00:17:20.573
Keep your eyes open.

[EXERTION]

00:17:28.247 --> 00:17:30.316

Wow.
That Eevee's really something.

00:17:55.575 --> 00:17:58.010
It totally countered
all our rhythm tactics.

00:17:58.010 --> 00:17:59.478
Yeah.

00:17:59.478 --> 00:18:00.913
You're in sync.

Hard to believe
this is the first time

00:18:02.481 --> 00:18:04.283
you and Eevee
have battled together.

Yes.

00:18:16.529 --> 00:18:18.230
I've got an idea.

00:18:18.230 --> 00:18:20.466
Shauna?
Can we put this on hold?

00:18:22.568 --> 00:18:25.338
That move made me think
of a new performance routine.

00:18:25.338 --> 00:18:27.473
I wanna practice right away.

00:18:27.473 --> 00:18:29.775
I'm the one who asked you
all to battle.

00:18:29.775 --> 00:18:31.611
I'm sorry.

00:18:31.611 --> 00:18:33.813
Well, if it's for
something like that.

00:18:33.813 --> 00:18:35.581
Go give it all you've got.

Yeah, he's right.

If it's going to be good
for your performance

00:18:38.718 --> 00:18:39.852
you should do it.

Yeah, Serena, good luck.

00:18:41.587 --> 00:18:42.955

No way.

We're going to work
on our performance as well.

if you could teach us
how to dance like you do.
