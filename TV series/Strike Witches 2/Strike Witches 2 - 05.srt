1
00:00:26,833 --> 00:00:28,541
Lynne... We're out of rice!

2
00:00:28,625 --> 00:00:30,125
But, what are we supposed to do?

3
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:31,875
No one's sent us any more yet!

4
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:33,500
Hey, Sakamoto...!

5
00:00:33,583 --> 00:00:36,041
Can we get some
more rice? We ran out!

6
00:00:37,375 --> 00:00:38,666
It seems everyone's been needing

7
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:41,000
to use the same supplies
at the same time...

8
00:00:41,083 --> 00:00:42,666
This could be a problem.

9
00:00:43,583 --> 00:00:45,083
What should we do now?

10
00:00:45,166 --> 00:00:47,416
We're actually out of a
lot more than just rice...

11
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:49,541
You two feel like
taking a shopping trip?

12
00:00:49,625 --> 00:00:52,833
Shopping trip? Okay!

13
00:02:27,333 --> 00:02:28,708
From here on out...

14
00:02:28,791 --> 00:02:31,458
we will be responsible for
providing our own supplies.

15
00:02:31,541 --> 00:02:32,958
Shirley and Francesca,

16
00:02:33,041 --> 00:02:35,250
I'm leaving you two in
charge of this mission...

17
00:02:35,333 --> 00:02:38,083
I figured that would be best
since Francesca is a native ...

18
00:02:38,166 --> 00:02:40,500
and Shirley is most
comfortable with the big truck.

19
00:02:40,583 --> 00:02:41,708
Understood!

20
00:02:41,791 --> 00:02:42,541
Awesome...!

21
00:02:42,625 --> 00:02:43,875
I haven't driven in forever!

22
00:02:43,958 --> 00:02:46,875
I apologize that we can't
send more of you today.

23
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:49,125
But there's no telling
when the enemy might attack.

24
00:02:49,208 --> 00:02:51,583
Yay! We're going for a drive!

25
00:02:51,666 --> 00:02:52,958
We're going for a drive!

26
00:02:53,041 --> 00:02:55,375
I've been dying to get
off of the base for ages...

27
00:02:55,458 --> 00:02:57,125
This is the best
assignment ever, thanks!

28
00:02:57,208 --> 00:02:59,250
Sergeant Miyafuji
and Sergeant Bishop,

29
00:02:59,333 --> 00:03:00,958
I'm sending you along as well.

30
00:03:01,041 --> 00:03:04,375
Um, 'scuse me...? I'd rather
stay on standby, if that's okay.

31
00:03:04,458 --> 00:03:06,541
What...? But why?

32
00:03:06,625 --> 00:03:08,125
Yes, of course.

33
00:03:08,208 --> 00:03:09,875
Then Miyafuji,
you'll accompany them.

34
00:03:09,958 --> 00:03:11,166
'Kay!

35
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:13,208
Lucchini, we'll rely on
you to be their guide.

36
00:03:13,291 --> 00:03:15,541
Yep...! You can count on me!

37
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,333
Miyafuji, make sure
you stay close to Shirley

38
00:03:19,416 --> 00:03:20,958
and follow her instructions.

39
00:03:21,041 --> 00:03:22,375
Right!

40
00:03:22,458 --> 00:03:24,791
If anyone wants something
specific, let us know now.

41
00:03:24,875 --> 00:03:26,416
Something we want...?

42
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,625
We could always use
new training equipment.

43
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:31,083
Perhaps, but that's
not what I meant,

44
00:03:31,166 --> 00:03:33,708
I'm thinking more along
the lines of relaxation.

45
00:03:33,791 --> 00:03:34,958
No argument here...

46
00:03:35,041 --> 00:03:37,041
'Cause they say if
you're gonna work hard...

47
00:03:37,125 --> 00:03:39,625
you should play hard...
and I agree.

48
00:03:40,833 --> 00:03:42,708
If that's the case, then
baths will be important

49
00:03:42,791 --> 00:03:44,875
for keeping up morale
after working all day.

50
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:47,000
Is training really
the only thing

51
00:03:47,083 --> 00:03:48,375
you girls can think about...?

52
00:03:48,458 --> 00:03:51,125
Does anyone have a
more realistic request?

53
00:03:51,208 --> 00:03:52,250
Major?

54
00:03:52,333 --> 00:03:55,041
Maybe... Maybe some
tea would be nice?

55
00:03:55,125 --> 00:03:57,458
Yes, Lynne...! Teatime
is very important...!

56
00:03:57,541 --> 00:04:00,250
I think I'd like a radio.
Wouldn't that be fun?

57
00:04:00,333 --> 00:04:02,291
But, our transmitter
works just fine

58
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:03,833
and it's one of the
best you can get.

59
00:04:03,916 --> 00:04:05,458
I mean one we can put in here...

60
00:04:05,541 --> 00:04:06,708
Wouldn't it be nice

61
00:04:06,791 --> 00:04:08,583
if we could listen to
some music or the news?

62
00:04:08,666 --> 00:04:11,708
Yes, I suppose...
Then that's your assignment...

63
00:04:11,791 --> 00:04:13,166
Does it all make sense?

64
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:15,333
Yep...! Tea and a radio...!

65
00:04:15,416 --> 00:04:17,000
I'm writing everything down.

66
00:04:17,083 --> 00:04:19,291
And a piano...!
Did you get that, too?

67
00:04:20,375 --> 00:04:23,791
I think that might be a
little too heavy to carry.

68
00:04:23,875 --> 00:04:27,000
Fine... I guess I won't be able
to hear Sanya play again...

69
00:04:27,083 --> 00:04:29,875
And what about you...?
Is there anything you want?

70
00:04:29,958 --> 00:04:31,125
Don't know...

71
00:04:31,208 --> 00:04:33,458
Why don't you ask for
something that you want?

72
00:04:33,541 --> 00:04:35,250
How about you, Barkhorn?

73
00:04:35,333 --> 00:04:37,583
I'm all right...
Thanks for asking.

74
00:04:37,666 --> 00:04:39,916
'Kay, well what about
a souvenir for Chris?

75
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,083
Oh... Maybe...
That would be nice...

76
00:04:43,166 --> 00:04:45,458
Um... Yeah...
Some clothes, I guess...

77
00:04:45,541 --> 00:04:47,000
You know, cute ones.

78
00:04:47,083 --> 00:04:48,250
Huh?

79
00:04:48,333 --> 00:04:49,416
I said clothes!

80
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,833
Um... We can do that...

81
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:53,916
What style does
she like...? Uh...

82
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,541
I don't know...
Does it really matter?

83
00:04:55,625 --> 00:04:57,166
Why don't you guys
just pick something...?

84
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:58,750
She's Lucchini's size.

85
00:04:58,833 --> 00:05:00,875
So we'll choose...? You sure?

86
00:05:00,958 --> 00:05:02,416
Yeah... Fine...

87
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:05,083
Whatever you guys get
will be good. I trust you.

88
00:05:05,166 --> 00:05:07,041
'Kay, you got it!

89
00:05:08,291 --> 00:05:09,458
What about you, Perrine?

90
00:05:09,541 --> 00:05:12,416
No, thank you...
I'm perfectly fine.

91
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,750
But... We never get to do this.

92
00:05:14,833 --> 00:05:18,291
You deaf...? I said no!

93
00:05:18,375 --> 00:05:20,041
Uh... I'm sorry.

94
00:05:22,208 --> 00:05:23,708
It's not you, Yoshika...

95
00:05:23,791 --> 00:05:25,000
She's been donating all her pay

96
00:05:25,083 --> 00:05:27,291
to the Gallia Restoration
Foundation, lately,

97
00:05:27,375 --> 00:05:29,416
and would rather her
share go towards that.

98
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,000
Really, huh?

99
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:33,416
I thought of something else...!

100
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:34,583
Do you think you could you get

101
00:05:34,666 --> 00:05:36,583
some flower seeds,
too--as well as my tea?

102
00:05:36,666 --> 00:05:37,958
Sure!

103
00:05:38,041 --> 00:05:40,916
Let's see... We need to
ask Hartmann what she wants.

104
00:05:41,916 --> 00:05:44,875
I haven't seen her today...
She's probably sleeping!

105
00:05:44,958 --> 00:05:47,750
Hartmann...! Are you awake?!

106
00:05:48,791 --> 00:05:51,083
Ninety more minutes, Mom.

107
00:05:51,166 --> 00:05:53,333
What soldier do you know
that fights from a mattress?!

108
00:05:53,416 --> 00:05:54,625
None! Get up!

109
00:05:54,708 --> 00:05:57,041
Hey... We're about to
go do some shopping...

110
00:05:57,125 --> 00:05:59,541
Is there anything you
want us to bring you?

111
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:00,916
Candy!

112
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,458
That's ridiculous. What you
need is an alarm clock!

113
00:06:03,541 --> 00:06:08,166
I want candy! I want
candy! I want candy!

114
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:10,333
Quiet!

115
00:06:10,416 --> 00:06:13,750
So if you could pick up an alarm
clock, too, that would be great.

116
00:06:13,833 --> 00:06:15,291
Yes, ma'am.

117
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:18,125
And one alarm clock.

118
00:06:18,208 --> 00:06:19,916
Don't leave!

119
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,250
A pillow!

120
00:06:21,333 --> 00:06:24,000
I said... bring me... a pillow.

121
00:06:24,083 --> 00:06:24,916
Okay.

122
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,083
It should be black with a small,

123
00:06:26,166 --> 00:06:27,958
red embroidered
design on the top...

124
00:06:28,041 --> 00:06:29,541
It has to be made of velvet...

125
00:06:29,625 --> 00:06:31,708
Or maybe silk,
but I prefer velvet...

126
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:33,208
Make sure it's stuffed with down

127
00:06:33,291 --> 00:06:35,708
or at least feathers from
a bird that lives near water.

128
00:06:35,791 --> 00:06:37,000
Hold on...! Um...

129
00:06:37,083 --> 00:06:38,666
You get all that?

130
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:40,958
I got that you want a pillow
and something about water birds,

131
00:06:41,041 --> 00:06:43,333
but there was too
much to remember!

132
00:06:43,416 --> 00:06:44,916
Fine, just give me that...

133
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,875
I'll write it down...
But don't mess up.

134
00:06:51,375 --> 00:06:52,791
I'm not writing all
this for nothing...

135
00:06:52,875 --> 00:06:54,041
You have to find one.

136
00:06:54,125 --> 00:06:55,583
'Kay.

137
00:06:58,875 --> 00:06:59,916
Be careful!

138
00:07:00,791 --> 00:07:02,708
We'll see you later!

139
00:07:02,791 --> 00:07:05,541
Please be safe out there.

140
00:07:18,583 --> 00:07:19,958
Wow!

141
00:07:20,041 --> 00:07:23,625
It's so pretty...! I wish
Lynne could've come with us!

142
00:07:26,125 --> 00:07:28,833
Looks like a clear road
to me... Now to really drive!

143
00:07:34,666 --> 00:07:35,166
Whoa!

144
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:35,791
Hold on!

145
00:07:35,875 --> 00:07:37,291
Here we go!

146
00:07:47,375 --> 00:07:49,291
We're gonna die!

147
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:51,375
You mean fly!

148
00:07:53,125 --> 00:07:53,833
Go!

149
00:07:53,916 --> 00:07:55,500
Make it stop!

150
00:07:57,458 --> 00:07:59,125
Hold on, guys!

151
00:08:03,166 --> 00:08:04,791
Hooray!

152
00:08:04,875 --> 00:08:06,375
Nailed it!

153
00:08:14,375 --> 00:08:17,375
My tummy hurts.

154
00:08:17,458 --> 00:08:21,125
Hey...! Stop...!
Don't be sick, Yoshika!

155
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:27,166
Oh, wow! We're really here!

156
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:31,666
Is this your first time
in Rome or something?

157
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:33,541
Yeah... What's over there?!

158
00:08:33,625 --> 00:08:35,791
One of the old
fighting coliseums.

159
00:08:35,875 --> 00:08:37,458
Wow...! What about that?!

160
00:08:37,541 --> 00:08:39,041
That's called a town hall!

161
00:08:39,125 --> 00:08:41,541
It's the most
beautiful town hall ever!

162
00:08:41,625 --> 00:08:44,250
So cute...!
It's like you're nine!

163
00:08:44,333 --> 00:08:46,791
Rome is such a
beautiful, historic city.

164
00:08:46,875 --> 00:08:49,625
Yes it is... and the
natives are gorgeous!

165
00:08:49,708 --> 00:08:52,375
I'm pretty sure I can
guess what that means...

166
00:08:52,458 --> 00:08:55,541
Were you born here?
It really is wonderful.

167
00:08:57,041 --> 00:08:58,125
You're right.

168
00:08:58,208 --> 00:08:59,291
You couldn't stop
bragging about Rome even

169
00:08:59,375 --> 00:09:01,333
when we stayed in
an African paradise!

170
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:02,583
Yes I could...!

171
00:09:02,666 --> 00:09:04,375
I just didn't want to
'cause it's that great!

172
00:09:04,458 --> 00:09:05,416
Put your guns down...

173
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:07,208
We're all Team Rome, okay?

174
00:09:09,791 --> 00:09:11,125
Are you sure about this place?

175
00:09:11,208 --> 00:09:14,000
Yep...! This shop has everything
you could possibly want!

176
00:09:14,083 --> 00:09:17,916
It does! Amazing!

177
00:09:20,666 --> 00:09:21,500
Let's see...

178
00:09:21,583 --> 00:09:23,083
Scratch radio off the list.

179
00:09:23,166 --> 00:09:24,625
I'm getting this for me!

180
00:09:24,708 --> 00:09:27,041
Hey, did you find an
alarm clock for Hartmann...?

181
00:09:27,125 --> 00:09:28,708
Take this. My arm's falling off.

182
00:09:28,791 --> 00:09:30,500
Okay!

183
00:09:30,583 --> 00:09:33,625
Tea, flowers,
and now some clothes.

184
00:09:34,541 --> 00:09:37,625
Ooh. That would look
great on you! Get it!

185
00:09:37,708 --> 00:09:39,083
Oh no, it's not for me.

186
00:09:39,166 --> 00:09:41,041
This is what Barkhorn
asked us to get.

187
00:09:41,125 --> 00:09:45,333
What...?! Really...? Barkhorn?

188
00:09:50,416 --> 00:09:51,875
Is it really that funny...?

189
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:54,500
No, wait! It's not for her,
it's for her sister!

190
00:09:56,041 --> 00:09:57,291
Her sister, right.

191
00:09:57,375 --> 00:10:00,125
I promise! She asked us
to pick something for her!

192
00:10:00,208 --> 00:10:03,000
Stop it, Yoshika.
I can't take this...!

193
00:10:03,083 --> 00:10:05,250
Barkhorn wants a dress!

194
00:10:10,125 --> 00:10:11,041
Let go of me, jerk!

195
00:10:11,125 --> 00:10:16,291
Super... Lucchini... Kick !

196
00:10:19,291 --> 00:10:20,833
Safe!

197
00:10:20,916 --> 00:10:22,166
How did you... But they...

198
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:25,166
Hi...! Come on, let's go!

199
00:10:27,416 --> 00:10:28,916
Come back!

200
00:10:45,083 --> 00:10:47,916
Thank you so much...
but, who are you?

201
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,416
You mean me?

202
00:10:51,416 --> 00:10:55,250
I'm an upholder of justice...
Francesca Lucchini!

203
00:10:55,333 --> 00:10:57,541
Nice to meet you. I'm Maria.

204
00:10:57,625 --> 00:10:59,500
Maria! I like that name!

205
00:10:59,583 --> 00:11:02,875
Well... I appreciate
you helping me.

206
00:11:02,958 --> 00:11:04,750
Sure... What was happening?

207
00:11:04,833 --> 00:11:06,833
Oh, um...

208
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:09,583
Oh...! I know...!
They're with the Mafia...!

209
00:11:09,666 --> 00:11:10,875
I'm right, aren't I?!

210
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:13,666
Um, yes...
It's something like that.

211
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:15,125
I knew it!

212
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:17,541
You don't need to be hanging
around in back alleys...!

213
00:11:17,625 --> 00:11:19,541
It's really quite dangerous!

214
00:11:22,583 --> 00:11:24,208
'Kay... Thanks for the advice.

215
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,416
Guess what...?
I'm shopping, too.

216
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:34,625
Do you wanna go together?

217
00:11:34,708 --> 00:11:37,041
Thanks, but I'm actually
not shopping today.

218
00:11:37,125 --> 00:11:39,000
Then what are
you doing out here?

219
00:11:39,083 --> 00:11:42,291
Well... um...
sightseeing, I guess...

220
00:11:42,375 --> 00:11:43,791
Or, more like taking a walk.

221
00:11:43,875 --> 00:11:44,958
A walk?

222
00:11:45,041 --> 00:11:47,750
Yes... I rarely get
to leave my house...

223
00:11:47,833 --> 00:11:50,500
so I don't know Rome very well.

224
00:11:52,875 --> 00:11:55,250
I was born here,
but I know nothing about it...

225
00:11:55,333 --> 00:11:57,041
Isn't that strange?

226
00:11:58,541 --> 00:12:01,000
Lucky for you, you met
the Great Lucchini today!

227
00:12:01,083 --> 00:12:03,791
Come on...! Let's go!

228
00:12:12,625 --> 00:12:16,166
Really...? She's not
in the truck, either.

229
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:19,541
She was just sitting in a chair
at the store a few minutes ago.

230
00:12:19,625 --> 00:12:23,000
Well, it looks like
she left, and what's more,

231
00:12:23,083 --> 00:12:24,791
she took the money
we need with her.

232
00:12:24,875 --> 00:12:27,875
What? Why?! We still
haven't bought any food!

233
00:12:27,958 --> 00:12:31,000
Yeah, that's annoying, but
don't stress. She'll be back.

234
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:32,750
We have to go find her!

235
00:12:43,833 --> 00:12:46,000
Huge, isn't it?!

236
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:49,458
It's stupendous!

237
00:12:50,375 --> 00:12:52,000
Hey, Francesca...

238
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:05,375
I don't get where
she could've gone!

239
00:13:08,833 --> 00:13:10,000
Watch and learn...

240
00:13:10,083 --> 00:13:11,416
If you throw a coin
backwards like this...

241
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:13,125
It means you'll
return to Rome someday!

242
00:13:13,208 --> 00:13:16,250
Like this?

243
00:13:23,333 --> 00:13:24,833
Shirley, look!

244
00:13:25,291 --> 00:13:25,875
Ya found her?!

245
00:13:25,958 --> 00:13:27,291
A kitty!

246
00:13:36,375 --> 00:13:38,041
Here! This one's for you!

247
00:13:38,541 --> 00:13:40,000
Wow! Thank you!

248
00:13:40,083 --> 00:13:41,875
Grazi!

249
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:45,416
Whoa!

250
00:14:06,875 --> 00:14:08,208
Hot--ouch!

251
00:14:10,458 --> 00:14:11,791
Bye-bye!!

252
00:14:11,875 --> 00:14:12,958
Bye-bye!

253
00:14:13,041 --> 00:14:15,166
Be careful!

254
00:14:16,291 --> 00:14:17,875
My pouch is empty.

255
00:14:26,291 --> 00:14:28,791
Okay, she's been eaten.
I give up.

256
00:14:28,875 --> 00:14:31,041
I just can't believe
we didn't find her...

257
00:14:31,125 --> 00:14:33,250
We must've asked
everyone we saw!

258
00:14:36,583 --> 00:14:38,916
It's delicious...!
Shirley, you have to try this!

259
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,500
It's the best cake
in the whole world!

260
00:14:40,583 --> 00:14:42,458
I'm busy being dead.

261
00:14:42,541 --> 00:14:43,666
Here!

262
00:14:47,166 --> 00:14:49,291
Woah...! That's the
best cake in the world!

263
00:14:49,375 --> 00:14:50,500
I know!

264
00:14:50,583 --> 00:14:51,875
Hey...! Can we have
another cake, please...?

265
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:53,250
I mean... two cakes!

266
00:14:53,333 --> 00:14:54,666
And please hurry!

267
00:15:02,875 --> 00:15:03,875
Tell the truth, Maria!

268
00:15:03,958 --> 00:15:05,541
Don't you love the view?

269
00:15:05,625 --> 00:15:07,791
It's my number
one favoritest ever!

270
00:15:07,875 --> 00:15:09,875
It's so beautiful.

271
00:15:09,958 --> 00:15:12,250
Perfect... I wish
I could just stay here,

272
00:15:12,333 --> 00:15:14,125
instead of going back home.

273
00:15:14,208 --> 00:15:16,416
All ya have to do is stay put!

274
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:18,375
Exactly.

275
00:15:18,458 --> 00:15:19,958
Tell me something...

276
00:15:20,041 --> 00:15:22,875
Do you believe I would be able
to protect this beautiful city?

277
00:15:22,958 --> 00:15:24,500
Huh?

278
00:15:24,583 --> 00:15:26,416
Look! There's smoke
coming from that house!

279
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:29,041
It's just someone
cooking a meal, silly.

280
00:15:29,125 --> 00:15:31,208
So here's where
they all live...?

281
00:15:31,291 --> 00:15:34,041
Every single one of those
houses holds a denizen.

282
00:15:34,125 --> 00:15:35,083
A denizen?

283
00:15:35,166 --> 00:15:38,000
I had no idea until today.

284
00:15:38,083 --> 00:15:39,416
Seriously?

285
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,000
Hey! I just remembered
one more view

286
00:15:41,083 --> 00:15:43,916
I have to show you before
you go back! It's amazing!

287
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,833
Sounds great!
I'd love to see it!

288
00:15:47,708 --> 00:15:49,458
But maybe not right now.

289
00:15:49,541 --> 00:15:51,208
I understand...

290
00:15:51,291 --> 00:15:54,166
Then maybe you can show
it to me next time... right?

291
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:56,000
Yeah!

292
00:16:00,791 --> 00:16:02,583
No way... I can't
believe they've come

293
00:16:02,666 --> 00:16:04,375
this far south already!

294
00:16:04,916 --> 00:16:05,875
It's the Neuroi!

295
00:16:05,958 --> 00:16:07,583
Oh, no!

296
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:08,625
Let's go, Yoshika!

297
00:16:08,708 --> 00:16:09,791
Right!

298
00:16:10,708 --> 00:16:13,416
We need to escape
quickly, Miss Lucchini!

299
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:15,083
Sorry, gotta go!

300
00:16:16,458 --> 00:16:18,541
Look...! There she is...!
I see her!

301
00:16:18,625 --> 00:16:20,041
On top of the tower!

302
00:16:20,125 --> 00:16:21,083
Tower?!

303
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:27,833
Shirley!

304
00:16:27,916 --> 00:16:29,083
That's dangerous!

305
00:16:29,166 --> 00:16:31,458
I gotta go...! I'm one
of the Strike Witches!

306
00:16:33,083 --> 00:16:34,291
Will you hold this?

307
00:16:35,291 --> 00:16:36,083
A Witch?

308
00:16:36,166 --> 00:16:37,833
Yep!

309
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:43,375
See you later...!
I gotta protect Romagna!

310
00:17:01,416 --> 00:17:02,916
Miss Lucchini.

311
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,125
I'll be protecting Romagna!

312
00:17:05,208 --> 00:17:07,875
Don't get too far ahead of us!

313
00:17:07,958 --> 00:17:09,125
I'm fine!

314
00:17:09,208 --> 00:17:11,083
I know you are...
but you can't do it alone.

315
00:17:11,166 --> 00:17:13,791
We wanna help protect
your home, too, Francesca...

316
00:17:13,875 --> 00:17:15,750
Let us fly beside you!

317
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:18,333
You're the best...

318
00:17:18,416 --> 00:17:20,166
Really... Thank you!

319
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:22,333
Ready...? Let's tandem attack!

320
00:17:35,291 --> 00:17:38,625
There it is! Shirley!
Found the core!

321
00:17:38,708 --> 00:17:40,458
All right! X Attack!

322
00:17:44,458 --> 00:17:45,666
Right behind you!

323
00:17:47,916 --> 00:17:50,541
That's it... Keep coming...
Right here!

324
00:17:52,458 --> 00:17:53,750
It saw through it!

325
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:22,125
Goodness.

326
00:18:22,208 --> 00:18:24,250
Yoshika...! Can ya hold this?!

327
00:18:28,791 --> 00:18:30,250
Now I can show you!

328
00:18:31,208 --> 00:18:32,708
Um... Where are we going?!

329
00:18:42,625 --> 00:18:44,125
Now, just look out there!

330
00:18:44,208 --> 00:18:47,250
This is the view I wanted to
show you from the beginning.

331
00:18:48,208 --> 00:18:49,666
It's amazing...

332
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:52,416
but... aren't you ever
afraid, Miss Lucchini?

333
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:55,083
Why? Whaddaya mean?

334
00:18:55,166 --> 00:18:56,500
Like what you just did...

335
00:18:56,583 --> 00:18:58,875
You aren't afraid of fighting
such terrifying enemies?

336
00:18:58,958 --> 00:19:00,208
The Neuroi?

337
00:19:00,291 --> 00:19:02,333
If we don't fight them,
Romagna will disappear...

338
00:19:02,416 --> 00:19:03,791
and we can't have that.

339
00:19:03,875 --> 00:19:06,375
Protecting people's homes
and friends is what we do...

340
00:19:06,458 --> 00:19:08,166
It's part of being a Witch!

341
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:11,750
So, like a noblesse
oblige, I suppose?

342
00:19:11,833 --> 00:19:13,791
I don't know what that means.

343
00:19:13,875 --> 00:19:15,583
You use big words sometimes.

344
00:19:15,666 --> 00:19:17,083
You really think so?

345
00:19:21,875 --> 00:19:23,000
Oh no!

346
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:28,416
Can you find your way?

347
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,833
Yes... I had the most
wonderful day today.

348
00:19:30,916 --> 00:19:32,041
Thank you so much.

349
00:19:32,125 --> 00:19:33,416
Really?

350
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:35,083
Yes...! Being with you
today has helped me realize

351
00:19:35,166 --> 00:19:36,791
what I'm supposed to do here.

352
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:39,875
Okay... I'm glad then!

353
00:19:41,166 --> 00:19:42,583
Ciao!

354
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:47,750
Bye-bye, Maria...!
I'll see ya later!

355
00:20:04,791 --> 00:20:07,208
I'm sorry!

356
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:09,000
Really...

357
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:10,291
I can't believe you wasted
all of our food money

358
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:11,958
within a matter of hours.

359
00:20:12,041 --> 00:20:16,208
And you didn't stop her...! I
guess it's partially my fault...

360
00:20:16,291 --> 00:20:18,625
I'm the one who trusted you!

361
00:20:20,291 --> 00:20:22,375
Have fun scrubbing. Bye!

362
00:20:24,916 --> 00:20:26,208
Here... Will this work?

363
00:20:26,291 --> 00:20:27,666
I'm so glad you found it!

364
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:30,750
It's exactly what you
wanted... That's great.

365
00:20:30,833 --> 00:20:32,791
And this is for you, Sanya.

366
00:20:33,125 --> 00:20:35,666
Oh thank you... I love it.

367
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:38,333
I'm surprised I found yours,
I mean talk about a tall order!

368
00:20:38,416 --> 00:20:40,500
Come on, it wasn't that hard.

369
00:20:40,583 --> 00:20:42,583
Just a suggestion:
Maybe you should make it

370
00:20:42,666 --> 00:20:45,583
easier next time you
ask someone a favor.

371
00:20:47,583 --> 00:20:48,958
These are for you, Perrine.

372
00:20:49,041 --> 00:20:51,208
Thanks, but what are they?

373
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:52,583
They're flower seeds...

374
00:20:52,666 --> 00:20:54,125
Lynne thought
it might be nice for us

375
00:20:54,208 --> 00:20:56,041
to plant some of
them around the base...

376
00:20:56,125 --> 00:20:57,333
Wouldn't that be pretty?

377
00:20:57,416 --> 00:20:58,708
You thought of that?

378
00:20:58,791 --> 00:21:01,041
Yes... I was hoping that
maybe you would teach me how

379
00:21:01,125 --> 00:21:02,750
to grow and take care
of them sometime,

380
00:21:02,833 --> 00:21:04,375
since you're so good at it.

381
00:21:04,458 --> 00:21:07,083
What makes you think
I'd be interested in that?!

382
00:21:07,166 --> 00:21:08,791
Let's go plant them together!

383
00:21:08,875 --> 00:21:10,625
Will you please teach us?

384
00:21:12,458 --> 00:21:14,000
Very well, if you insist.

385
00:21:14,083 --> 00:21:15,375
The first thing we have to do is

386
00:21:15,458 --> 00:21:18,041
find a sunny place
to plant the marigolds...

387
00:21:18,125 --> 00:21:20,416
then a cooler place for
the chamomile and bergamots...

388
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:21,875
They'll need to stay
out of direct sunlight

389
00:21:21,958 --> 00:21:23,291
in the summer time.

390
00:21:23,375 --> 00:21:26,291
Want candy... Need candy!

391
00:21:27,666 --> 00:21:30,166
Whadda you think of this one...
Is it the right size?

392
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:33,208
Wow... I mean...
Thank you... It is!

393
00:21:33,291 --> 00:21:35,208
The bust is a little small.

394
00:21:35,291 --> 00:21:37,500
No, it's not...! It's perfect!

395
00:21:37,583 --> 00:21:39,916
Alright, alright...
It's perfect.

396
00:21:40,291 --> 00:21:41,875
Are you ready?!

397
00:21:42,708 --> 00:21:45,291
We interrupt this program
to bring you a live broadcast.

398
00:21:45,375 --> 00:21:47,375
Maria, the Duchess of
the Duchy of Romagna

399
00:21:47,458 --> 00:21:49,375
made her first official
appearance today.

400
00:21:49,458 --> 00:21:50,875
She has asked to
address the nation

401
00:21:50,958 --> 00:21:52,708
on a very important subject.

402
00:21:52,791 --> 00:21:56,541
Yesterday, a terrible
Neuroi attack was launched

403
00:21:56,625 --> 00:21:59,333
on Rome and threatened
the lives of our citizens...

404
00:21:59,416 --> 00:22:02,458
However... the Neuroi was
repelled thanks to the actions

405
00:22:02,541 --> 00:22:05,125
and bravery of a small,
but mighty, Witch.

406
00:22:05,208 --> 00:22:07,041
I've learned so much from her...

407
00:22:07,125 --> 00:22:10,458
She risked everything to protect
the lives of her loved ones...

408
00:22:10,541 --> 00:22:13,375
and to guard the
security of Romagna...

409
00:22:13,458 --> 00:22:16,416
We have the strength within
us if we just have the heart.

410
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:19,708
That's why...
I vow to do my part...

411
00:22:19,791 --> 00:22:23,083
My love for all of you gives me
the strength to keep us safe...

412
00:22:23,166 --> 00:22:27,208
Thank you, for your heart
and inspiration, my dear friend.

413
00:22:27,291 --> 00:22:29,458
Miss Francesca Lucchini.

414
00:22:30,958 --> 00:22:32,500
What?!

415
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:45,916
And so it is with
sincere gratitude

416
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,166
that I send a humble
token of my appreciation...

417
00:22:49,541 --> 00:22:52,750
to the Five Hundred and
First Joint Fighter Wing Squad.

418
00:22:53,083 --> 00:22:55,083
Ow... I'm stuck!

419
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:31,666
Sanya is hugging the
pillow I just bought...

420
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:33,875
That pillow is
lounging in her arms.

421
00:24:33,958 --> 00:24:36,375
It's nestled in her chest,
and it's feeling the warmth

422
00:24:36,458 --> 00:24:37,791
of her skin and even
listening to her heartbeat!

423
00:24:37,875 --> 00:24:40,958
On the next Strike Witches 2:
"Higher than the Sky."
