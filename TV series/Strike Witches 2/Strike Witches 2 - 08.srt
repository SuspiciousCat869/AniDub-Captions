1
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,458
What's she doing?

2
00:00:49,458 --> 00:00:52,291
Reppuzan!

3
00:01:03,666 --> 00:01:04,875
What was that?

4
00:02:42,791 --> 00:02:44,125
Miyafuji.

5
00:02:44,208 --> 00:02:46,500
That was an amazing technique.
I mean, incredible!

6
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:48,791
Not incredible enough...

7
00:02:48,875 --> 00:02:50,416
My goal is to
master the Reppusan

8
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,875
so it transcends
into the Reppuzan.

9
00:02:52,958 --> 00:02:54,416
Shin-Reppuzan.

10
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:57,416
Oh... A Shin-Reppuzan?

11
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,250
Yes... It's a highly secretive

12
00:02:59,333 --> 00:03:01,416
and antique technique
of the Fuso Empire...

13
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,333
It's power can
destroy any Neuroi...

14
00:03:03,416 --> 00:03:05,416
with a single blow, at that...

15
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,083
I just have to master it.

16
00:03:08,791 --> 00:03:10,166
Please, Sakamoto!

17
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:12,083
Will you teach me how to use
the Shin-Reppuzan, too...?

18
00:03:12,166 --> 00:03:13,583
If we both learn how to use it,

19
00:03:13,666 --> 00:03:16,083
maybe we can defeat the
Neuroi that much faster!

20
00:03:16,166 --> 00:03:20,375
No... You're still a beginner;
you won't be strong enough yet.

21
00:03:20,458 --> 00:03:23,000
Well, I can try, though...!
It won't hurt anything!

22
00:03:23,083 --> 00:03:25,125
You have to give me a shot!

23
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:30,541
I'm sorry.

24
00:03:39,375 --> 00:03:41,666
Hey, Yoshika. Ya took
long enough. Jeez.

25
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:44,708
We're having spaghetti di
farro and vongole bianco...!

26
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:47,083
I hope you brought
your appetite!

27
00:03:51,416 --> 00:03:53,333
You seem kinda down, Yoshika...

28
00:03:53,416 --> 00:03:55,416
Are you feeling
sick or anything?

29
00:03:56,583 --> 00:03:58,875
No. I'm good.
Healthy as a horse as usual.

30
00:03:58,958 --> 00:04:00,250
Then you should eat.

31
00:04:00,333 --> 00:04:02,000
It doesn't matter
if you're not hungry...

32
00:04:02,083 --> 00:04:04,791
You won't be able to fight
properly in an emergency

33
00:04:04,875 --> 00:04:07,333
if you're not taking in
enough energy, a-k-a food!

34
00:04:07,416 --> 00:04:09,125
Yes, ma'am.

35
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:10,625
Just energy, great.

36
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:14,375
Come on... No one wants to
hear your lame soldier lectures

37
00:04:14,458 --> 00:04:15,833
first thing in the morning.

38
00:04:15,916 --> 00:04:17,291
What...?! Hartmann...!

39
00:04:17,375 --> 00:04:19,541
Karlsland soldiers
do not speak that way!

40
00:04:19,625 --> 00:04:21,416
And... here we go.

41
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:24,041
Look... This isn't
Britannia; they don't have

42
00:04:24,125 --> 00:04:26,000
a whole lot of
military might here...

43
00:04:26,083 --> 00:04:28,750
Our responsibilities are
more vital than ever before!

44
00:04:28,833 --> 00:04:32,041
She's right...
I need to try harder, too...

45
00:04:32,125 --> 00:04:34,791
I bet that's the reason Sakamoto
won't teach me the Reppuzan.

46
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:36,125
I'm unreliable.

47
00:04:37,583 --> 00:04:38,833
Yay, food!

48
00:04:53,083 --> 00:04:54,083
Look at her go!

49
00:04:54,166 --> 00:04:55,875
I swear she's
faster than before...!

50
00:04:55,958 --> 00:04:58,375
That's okay, though.
I'm still better.

51
00:05:02,541 --> 00:05:03,500
Gotcha!

52
00:05:05,125 --> 00:05:06,375
A hard left turn?!

53
00:05:06,875 --> 00:05:07,833
Hey, there!

54
00:05:07,916 --> 00:05:09,166
Don't 'hey, there' me!

55
00:05:12,416 --> 00:05:14,541
She missed...?!
At this range, too...

56
00:05:16,208 --> 00:05:17,666
What's going on?!

57
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:19,166
My turn now!

58
00:05:23,125 --> 00:05:25,458
Match one is over!
And the winner is Perinne!

59
00:05:25,541 --> 00:05:26,625
Yes, of course I won.

60
00:05:26,708 --> 00:05:28,583
Not that it's a
surprise to anybody.

61
00:05:28,666 --> 00:05:32,833
That was weird... it's like
I suddenly lost strength.

62
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:35,208
Yoshika!

63
00:05:35,291 --> 00:05:36,541
Yeah? What?

64
00:05:36,625 --> 00:05:37,958
What are you just floating
around like that for...?

65
00:05:38,041 --> 00:05:40,500
We still have more
skirmishes to go.

66
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,916
The match is over!
Perrine wins again!

67
00:05:50,583 --> 00:05:53,791
I can't seem to fly
well... What's wrong?

68
00:05:53,875 --> 00:05:56,083
You had three losses
out of three, Yoshika...

69
00:05:56,166 --> 00:05:57,750
That's not like you at all.

70
00:05:57,833 --> 00:05:59,250
You know, I'd appreciate it

71
00:05:59,333 --> 00:06:02,000
if you didn't hold back just
because this is training...

72
00:06:02,083 --> 00:06:03,250
Or what?

73
00:06:03,333 --> 00:06:04,833
Are you simply refusing
to take me seriously?

74
00:06:04,916 --> 00:06:08,666
No! I'm not holding back; I'm
taking you seriously, I swear!

75
00:06:17,208 --> 00:06:19,458
Interesting... It seemed
that way to you, too?

76
00:06:19,541 --> 00:06:21,250
Yes. There was
definitely something

77
00:06:21,333 --> 00:06:22,916
strange going on
with Yoshika today...

78
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,958
It was like she
was off her game...

79
00:06:26,041 --> 00:06:27,333
All right, then...

80
00:06:27,416 --> 00:06:29,500
Thank you for letting
me know, Perinne...

81
00:06:29,583 --> 00:06:31,541
This was a very kind
thing for you to do.

82
00:06:31,625 --> 00:06:35,083
Oh, no I... I'm sorry,
you misunderstood.

83
00:06:35,166 --> 00:06:36,750
I simply feel it's
important to acknowledge

84
00:06:36,833 --> 00:06:39,291
any situation that
might weaken our unit...

85
00:06:39,375 --> 00:06:42,291
I didn't mean to imply that
I was concerned about Yoshika.

86
00:06:46,291 --> 00:06:47,333
We crosschecked
everything listed,

87
00:06:47,416 --> 00:06:49,416
but found nothing
out of the ordinary.

88
00:06:50,333 --> 00:06:52,416
The magic engine's been
given a complete overhaul...

89
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:53,833
We even replaced the oil

90
00:06:53,916 --> 00:06:57,625
and used brand new spark
plugs just to be sure, but...

91
00:06:57,708 --> 00:06:58,875
I see...

92
00:06:58,958 --> 00:07:01,250
So there's not a problem
with the Striker Unit...

93
00:07:01,333 --> 00:07:03,708
Understood... Thank you.

94
00:07:04,458 --> 00:07:07,458
Meaning the problem
lies with Yoshika herself.

95
00:07:10,166 --> 00:07:12,375
Alright, you can put
your clothes back on.

96
00:07:12,458 --> 00:07:13,625
Thanks.

97
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,250
Well, it looks like
she's perfectly healthy.

98
00:07:17,333 --> 00:07:18,791
Thank you, Doctor.

99
00:07:18,875 --> 00:07:22,000
Hey, why did I have to get a
medical checkup all of a sudden?

100
00:07:22,083 --> 00:07:24,000
Well, it is the job of
a commanding officer

101
00:07:24,083 --> 00:07:25,208
to keep thorough tabs

102
00:07:25,291 --> 00:07:27,125
on the health of her
subordinates, isn't it?

103
00:07:27,208 --> 00:07:29,916
But there's nothing
wrong with me, is there?

104
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,875
No... There's nothing wrong
with you at all, Yoshika...

105
00:07:32,958 --> 00:07:35,291
It's like you said,
you're as healthy as a horse.

106
00:07:36,375 --> 00:07:38,375
Actually, one of the things
I'm most proud of is that,

107
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:41,125
in my whole life,
I've never even caught a cold!

108
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,708
Hey. What are the two
of you doing there?

109
00:07:45,166 --> 00:07:47,000
We're sorry.

110
00:07:48,916 --> 00:07:50,333
Guys, what are you doing here?

111
00:07:50,416 --> 00:07:52,458
We wanted to make
sure that you were okay.

112
00:07:52,541 --> 00:07:55,041
No need to worry;
it was just a check-up.

113
00:07:55,125 --> 00:07:56,500
I'm in tip-top shape!

114
00:07:56,583 --> 00:07:58,583
Thank goodness.

115
00:07:58,666 --> 00:07:59,666
Thank goodness, indeed.

116
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:01,000
As a Witch,

117
00:08:01,083 --> 00:08:02,916
maintaining one's health
is a vital responsibility.

118
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:05,875
Really, I'm okay. I promise.

119
00:08:05,958 --> 00:08:08,708
And if that's the case,
this is all the more upsetting.

120
00:08:08,791 --> 00:08:10,833
Captain Barkhorn!
Where did you come from?

121
00:08:10,916 --> 00:08:12,625
We know you aren't
able to fly properly,

122
00:08:12,708 --> 00:08:14,541
but the problem is,
we don't know the reason.

123
00:08:14,625 --> 00:08:15,875
Which means you can't
be sent into combat

124
00:08:15,958 --> 00:08:18,208
until we have more information!

125
00:08:18,291 --> 00:08:19,625
What is she talking about...?

126
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:21,541
You're having trouble flying?

127
00:08:21,625 --> 00:08:22,875
Until the cause becomes clear,

128
00:08:22,958 --> 00:08:25,083
you've been ordered to
remain at base on standby.

129
00:08:25,166 --> 00:08:27,208
No, you can't...!
I can still fly!

130
00:08:27,291 --> 00:08:29,208
That is an order, Miyafuji.

131
00:08:29,291 --> 00:08:31,166
An order?

132
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:34,125
You heard her...
This is only for the best.

133
00:08:34,208 --> 00:08:35,041
No!

134
00:08:35,125 --> 00:08:36,250
Oh, Yoshika...

135
00:08:50,125 --> 00:08:51,375
Who's there?

136
00:08:51,458 --> 00:08:53,041
Yoshika? What are you doing?

137
00:08:53,125 --> 00:08:55,875
Seriously...
Why are you out here?

138
00:08:57,875 --> 00:09:01,125
Oh... So you were
training with a broom...?

139
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:03,125
You know, there was an
old lady in my neighborhood

140
00:09:03,208 --> 00:09:05,250
who flew around on a broom, too.

141
00:09:05,333 --> 00:09:09,041
But why are you doing
it so late at night?

142
00:09:09,125 --> 00:09:10,291
You guys...

143
00:09:10,375 --> 00:09:11,750
I was just wondering,
but, um, have either one

144
00:09:11,833 --> 00:09:14,166
of you ever lost the
ability to fly before?

145
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:15,208
Wait a minute...

146
00:09:15,291 --> 00:09:16,666
are you saying
that you can't fly?

147
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:18,666
No way! For real?
You can't fly?!

148
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:21,083
No! I can still fly,
it's just...

149
00:09:21,166 --> 00:09:24,041
Well, jeez... Don't scare
us like that, Yoshika!

150
00:09:25,166 --> 00:09:26,083
Who's there?

151
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:28,875
Ow!

152
00:09:30,791 --> 00:09:33,166
Eila?! What the
heck didja do that for?

153
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:34,500
Why are you here?!

154
00:09:34,583 --> 00:09:37,208
Well... no big reason
in particular...

155
00:09:37,291 --> 00:09:38,875
to use the restroom...?

156
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:41,041
You have a lump.

157
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:44,791
Don't laugh! It's your fault!

158
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:46,916
Almost done.

159
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,583
See, it's all better.

160
00:09:48,666 --> 00:09:51,000
At least we know your
magic energy is okay...

161
00:09:51,083 --> 00:09:53,000
Yeah, it seems so!
Way to go, girl.

162
00:09:53,083 --> 00:09:54,333
I wish you'd stop...!

163
00:09:54,416 --> 00:09:56,208
You shouldn't be experimenting
on peoples' heads!

164
00:09:56,291 --> 00:09:59,375
My magic's fine,
but I can't fly...

165
00:09:59,458 --> 00:10:02,250
Maybe you just need
to get some rest, Yoshika.

166
00:10:02,333 --> 00:10:03,541
She's right...

167
00:10:03,625 --> 00:10:05,333
It just sounds like
you're exhausted to me...

168
00:10:05,416 --> 00:10:08,666
Get a good night sleep
and see if that helps.

169
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:09,541
They have a point...

170
00:10:09,625 --> 00:10:11,833
You should be in bed, anyway.

171
00:10:11,916 --> 00:10:13,541
Oh... yeah.

172
00:10:26,916 --> 00:10:28,375
Please Fly!

173
00:10:37,708 --> 00:10:38,833
It's not fair...

174
00:10:38,916 --> 00:10:42,375
What's wrong...?
I don't understand this...

175
00:10:42,458 --> 00:10:45,333
I won't be able to
protect anyone at all now.

176
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:51,291
What are you doing here?

177
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:02,375
It looks like the
broom exploded.

178
00:11:05,458 --> 00:11:08,000
It feels as if you can see
the whole world, huh...?

179
00:11:08,083 --> 00:11:10,250
The Adriatic Sea is so pretty...

180
00:11:10,333 --> 00:11:12,791
We've looked out at
it like this before.

181
00:11:12,875 --> 00:11:13,875
Do you remember?

182
00:11:13,958 --> 00:11:14,916
Yeah...

183
00:11:16,875 --> 00:11:18,625
Do you wanna fix
the broom together?

184
00:11:18,708 --> 00:11:22,083
Yeah... Thanks...

185
00:11:39,791 --> 00:11:41,583
According to
Allied HQ, a Fuso fleet

186
00:11:41,666 --> 00:11:43,500
is scheduled to arrive
tomorrow with the battleship,

187
00:11:43,583 --> 00:11:46,416
Yamato, in order to
reinforce our military presence

188
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:48,166
in the Romagna region.

189
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:49,666
At last it's arriving.

190
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:51,208
Wait--the Yamato?

191
00:11:51,291 --> 00:11:52,666
Oh, have you heard of it before?

192
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:55,666
Uh-huh. I saw it while
I was at the port in Fuso...

193
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:57,250
It's freakin' ginormous.

194
00:11:57,333 --> 00:11:59,083
Wow...

195
00:12:02,291 --> 00:12:06,083
Yes...? An accident
aboard the Yamato?!

196
00:12:06,166 --> 00:12:08,041
There was?!

197
00:12:08,875 --> 00:12:09,958
No...

198
00:12:10,041 --> 00:12:11,791
Yes. I understand!

199
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:14,250
They're requesting assistance.

200
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:17,125
They just suffered an
explosion in their sick bay...

201
00:12:17,208 --> 00:12:18,541
Many were injured...

202
00:12:18,625 --> 00:12:21,625
They're asking for us to
dispatch doctors immediately.

203
00:12:21,708 --> 00:12:24,625
No problem... We'll send
them over on the H8K.

204
00:12:24,708 --> 00:12:26,333
Requesting permission to go...!

205
00:12:26,416 --> 00:12:29,208
Even if I can't fight,
I can still heal people!

206
00:12:29,291 --> 00:12:30,791
Please, let me go, too!.

207
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:32,916
I can help her out, Commander.

208
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,208
That's very generous...

209
00:12:34,291 --> 00:12:37,458
I knew they'd do
something like that.

210
00:12:37,541 --> 00:12:38,666
It couldn't hurt...

211
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:40,625
They'd arrive a lot
sooner than the airship.

212
00:12:40,708 --> 00:12:42,000
All right, then...

213
00:12:42,083 --> 00:12:44,041
Sergeants Bishop and Miyafuji...

214
00:12:44,125 --> 00:12:46,291
you'll leave for the
Yamato immediately.

215
00:12:46,375 --> 00:12:47,791
Yes, ma'am!

216
00:12:52,583 --> 00:12:53,750
Yoshika! Are you all right?

217
00:12:53,833 --> 00:12:55,750
Uh... Yeah.

218
00:12:57,666 --> 00:12:59,041
What do I do?

219
00:12:59,125 --> 00:13:02,083
I can't fly well at all...
And it's just getting worse.

220
00:13:03,666 --> 00:13:05,166
It's the Yamato!

221
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:06,833
It's huge!

222
00:13:21,875 --> 00:13:24,541
Great...! Please tell me you
two are Yoshika and Lynnette!

223
00:13:24,625 --> 00:13:26,458
Yes!

224
00:13:26,541 --> 00:13:28,166
This is currently our
most critical patient...

225
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:29,916
But most of our equipment
has been destroyed,

226
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,958
so there's not much
more we can do.

227
00:13:33,125 --> 00:13:34,625
Is he dying?

228
00:13:34,708 --> 00:13:36,041
Leave it to me!

229
00:13:40,416 --> 00:13:41,875
The bleeding's
completely stopped!

230
00:13:41,958 --> 00:13:43,833
Good! Can you
bandage him up, Lynne?

231
00:13:43,916 --> 00:13:44,791
Yes!

232
00:13:44,875 --> 00:13:46,166
Okay, who's next?

233
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:53,416
Incredible...

234
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:54,833
I've heard so much about
her healing abilities,

235
00:13:54,916 --> 00:13:57,416
but I never imagined
they were so powerful.

236
00:13:58,166 --> 00:13:59,708
Are you sure you
can keep going?

237
00:13:59,791 --> 00:14:02,458
You've treated over ten patients
since we got here.

238
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:04,375
I'm fine...
Don't worry about me...

239
00:14:04,458 --> 00:14:06,291
I'm still feeling pretty strong.

240
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:07,458
All right...

241
00:14:07,541 --> 00:14:08,333
That should fix him up...

242
00:14:08,416 --> 00:14:09,583
Who's next, sir?

243
00:14:09,666 --> 00:14:10,625
No one...

244
00:14:10,708 --> 00:14:12,541
He was the last
of our injured men.

245
00:14:12,625 --> 00:14:13,541
The last?

246
00:14:13,625 --> 00:14:15,125
That's right...

247
00:14:15,208 --> 00:14:17,708
Thanks to you two, every single
soldier has made it out alive...

248
00:14:17,791 --> 00:14:19,833
We will always be forever
in your debt, ladies.

249
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:23,291
Isn't that great...? We did it!

250
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:28,000
I can't believe it...
Everyone survived.

251
00:14:28,083 --> 00:14:30,625
That's wonderful news,
sir... It's a miracle.

252
00:14:30,708 --> 00:14:34,041
It appears Yoshika Miyafuji
has saved us yet again.

253
00:14:34,125 --> 00:14:37,541
Any ideas on how we'll show
our gratitude this time?

254
00:14:38,375 --> 00:14:41,000
If I recall, last time
we gave her a doll

255
00:14:41,083 --> 00:14:43,000
that looked like a Fuso soldier.

256
00:14:44,916 --> 00:14:46,500
We have a report
from the radar room...

257
00:14:46,583 --> 00:14:49,208
Large Neuroi detected...
Bearing three-four-oh...

258
00:14:49,291 --> 00:14:51,166
Distance currently
sixty thousand.

259
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:52,375
That can't be!.

260
00:14:52,458 --> 00:14:54,250
This is supposed to
be within the safe zone!

261
00:14:54,333 --> 00:14:55,583
Your Orders, sir?

262
00:14:55,666 --> 00:14:58,583
Attention all ships,
prepare for battle at once!

263
00:15:00,583 --> 00:15:01,291
A Neuroi?

264
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:02,750
C'mon... let's go!

265
00:15:14,208 --> 00:15:15,625
A Neuroi has appeared!

266
00:15:15,708 --> 00:15:17,125
Location?

267
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:20,000
Grid D-15! It's currently
bearing one-six-five degrees.

268
00:15:20,083 --> 00:15:22,583
Hold on... You realize
where that is?!

269
00:15:22,666 --> 00:15:23,416
The Yamato!

270
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:24,625
I don't understand.

271
00:15:24,708 --> 00:15:26,291
That's at least five
hundred kilometers away

272
00:15:26,375 --> 00:15:28,375
from where the Neuroi
hive is located!

273
00:15:28,458 --> 00:15:29,916
But why...?
There's never been a case

274
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,833
of one appearing
that far before!

275
00:15:31,916 --> 00:15:33,416
True; it is there, though...

276
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:36,875
Look, see? It's heading
for the Fuso Fleet!

277
00:15:36,958 --> 00:15:38,125
Damn!

278
00:15:58,041 --> 00:15:59,958
Prepare for
anti-aircraft combat...!

279
00:16:00,041 --> 00:16:01,625
Ready the main cannons!

280
00:16:01,708 --> 00:16:06,333
Target! Seventy degrees
right...! Three-zero-zero!

281
00:16:07,625 --> 00:16:08,666
Starboard!

282
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:10,250
Starboard, sir!

283
00:16:15,041 --> 00:16:16,791
Now, Neuroi...
You get to feel the might

284
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:19,708
of the Yamato's forty-six
centimeter cannons!

285
00:16:19,791 --> 00:16:21,416
Range... Two-Five-Zero!

286
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:23,125
Ready to fire, sir!

287
00:16:23,208 --> 00:16:25,500
Commence fire... at will!

288
00:16:30,083 --> 00:16:32,500
We nailed it... I'll bet
that didn't feel too good!

289
00:16:32,583 --> 00:16:34,291
Ready next volley!

290
00:16:35,875 --> 00:16:37,375
Lynne, you're not hurt, are you?

291
00:16:37,458 --> 00:16:40,041
No... Do you know
what that sound was?

292
00:16:40,125 --> 00:16:42,625
No, I'm not sure... It was loud.

293
00:16:42,708 --> 00:16:43,541
Yeah.

294
00:16:43,625 --> 00:16:44,666
C'mon!

295
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:45,916
Right.

296
00:16:46,666 --> 00:16:47,791
Raise by two!

297
00:16:47,875 --> 00:16:50,416
Right adjust by two!
Armor-piercing shells!

298
00:16:53,666 --> 00:16:55,541
Damn it! That was too close!

299
00:16:59,791 --> 00:17:01,958
Impacting... now!

300
00:17:02,041 --> 00:17:03,375
Report!

301
00:17:08,291 --> 00:17:09,083
Takao's been hit!

302
00:17:09,166 --> 00:17:11,791
No! It regenerates too quickly!

303
00:17:20,875 --> 00:17:22,250
Oh no!

304
00:17:26,916 --> 00:17:29,458
I don't... Why won't it work?

305
00:17:31,958 --> 00:17:33,166
Are you okay?

306
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:35,208
Yeah, just gimme a second!

307
00:17:44,666 --> 00:17:46,875
Please work...! Please!

308
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:51,625
Heavy damage to
the cruiser ship, Takao!

309
00:17:54,125 --> 00:17:57,291
Yoshika...? I'm gonna
go on ahead, 'kay?

310
00:17:58,125 --> 00:17:59,583
Lynne! No wait!

311
00:17:59,666 --> 00:18:02,333
Don't go...! Wait for me!

312
00:18:02,875 --> 00:18:06,166
No, come back!

313
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,041
Damn... The Takao
is dead in the water.

314
00:18:10,125 --> 00:18:12,000
It's a sitting duck out there.

315
00:18:12,375 --> 00:18:14,000
It's too late!
It's gonna be hit!

316
00:18:16,291 --> 00:18:17,125
It's Lynne Bishop!

317
00:18:17,208 --> 00:18:18,041
Can you hear me...?

318
00:18:18,125 --> 00:18:19,458
We can.

319
00:18:19,541 --> 00:18:21,625
You have to escape now
while I'm blocking the attack!

320
00:18:21,708 --> 00:18:23,458
I can't buy much more time!

321
00:18:23,541 --> 00:18:25,583
No, Lynne... You're all alone.

322
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:29,416
Please hurry up and go...!
You have to retreat!

323
00:18:30,333 --> 00:18:32,250
The Yamato is
vital to this war...

324
00:18:32,333 --> 00:18:35,041
We sure can't afford
to lose her here; not now.

325
00:18:36,125 --> 00:18:38,625
Power the engines!
Prepare retreat!

326
00:18:38,708 --> 00:18:40,625
All ships, withdraw immediately.

327
00:18:40,708 --> 00:18:43,125
Engines powered.
Beginning retreat!

328
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:48,625
I'm coming!

329
00:18:53,541 --> 00:18:56,083
Please, just work! You have to!

330
00:18:56,166 --> 00:19:00,041
You will...! I'm going
to fly right now!

331
00:19:05,708 --> 00:19:06,916
Thank goodness!

332
00:19:11,166 --> 00:19:12,125
Oh no!

333
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:17,208
The Fleet appears
to have altered course!.

334
00:19:17,291 --> 00:19:19,208
It's moving away
from the Neuroi!

335
00:19:19,291 --> 00:19:22,333
You mean they escaped...?
How did they manage that?

336
00:19:22,416 --> 00:19:25,750
Actually, it looks like
Lynne is acting as a decoy...

337
00:19:29,958 --> 00:19:31,000
Why...?

338
00:19:31,083 --> 00:19:33,541
Why can't I fly anymore?

339
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:41,833
Yoshika, know that you have
great power inside of you,

340
00:19:41,916 --> 00:19:43,958
just like your mother
and grandmother...

341
00:19:44,041 --> 00:19:45,750
Promise me when you grow up

342
00:19:45,833 --> 00:19:48,125
you'll use that power
to protect everyone.

343
00:19:48,208 --> 00:19:50,916
Okay... I promise!

344
00:19:54,875 --> 00:19:56,500
Dad, I'm so sorry...

345
00:19:56,583 --> 00:19:59,000
But I can't keep that
promise I made to you...

346
00:19:59,083 --> 00:20:01,041
I can't fly anymore!

347
00:20:01,125 --> 00:20:03,583
I won't be able
to protect anyone...

348
00:20:03,666 --> 00:20:05,583
Not even Lynne...

349
00:20:11,625 --> 00:20:15,375
Stop crying, Yoshika... You
haven't lost the ability to fly.

350
00:20:17,333 --> 00:20:20,833
Look... These are going
to be your new wings.

351
00:20:35,791 --> 00:20:37,458
It's a Striker Unit...

352
00:20:37,958 --> 00:20:40,208
Distance from Neuroi...
three nautical miles!

353
00:20:40,291 --> 00:20:42,125
Now out of firing range.

354
00:20:42,208 --> 00:20:46,500
I see... Even though it's
to protect the Yamato...

355
00:20:46,583 --> 00:20:48,000
we're still
withdrawing from battle

356
00:20:48,083 --> 00:20:50,041
and leaving a Witch behind...

357
00:20:50,125 --> 00:20:55,416
As a soldier of the Fuso
Empire... I am deeply ashamed.

358
00:20:55,833 --> 00:20:58,041
Hold on, Captain!
Th-the hangar is opening!

359
00:20:58,125 --> 00:20:59,458
What?

360
00:21:04,208 --> 00:21:06,500
Hold on, Lynne!
I'm coming for you!

361
00:21:07,583 --> 00:21:09,875
That's... She's wearing
the prototype unit!

362
00:21:09,958 --> 00:21:12,416
Sergeant Miyafuji!
It's too dangerous...!

363
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:14,916
That unit hasn't been
tested in the field yet!

364
00:21:20,541 --> 00:21:21,833
Takeoff!

365
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:33,791
Hold on Lynne!

366
00:21:41,958 --> 00:21:45,083
I hope Yoshika and the
others managed to get away...

367
00:21:52,166 --> 00:21:54,291
My magic is almost depleted...

368
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,041
Yoshika...

369
00:22:15,916 --> 00:22:17,250
You made it.

370
00:22:17,333 --> 00:22:19,375
I know. I'm sorry I'm so late!

371
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,708
Are you okay? Can you fly?

372
00:22:21,791 --> 00:22:23,000
Yeah.

373
00:22:24,416 --> 00:22:25,833
How dare you...?

374
00:22:25,916 --> 00:22:28,166
How dare you hurt Lynne!

375
00:22:52,708 --> 00:22:54,375
Yoshika!

376
00:22:56,083 --> 00:22:57,333
We did it, Lynne!

377
00:22:57,416 --> 00:22:59,833
No, you did it!
You saved me, Yoshika!

378
00:23:02,541 --> 00:23:05,625
Thank you, Dad... Thank you.

379
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,250
That light...
Are those Neuroi fragments?

380
00:23:09,333 --> 00:23:11,833
Yes. It appears the
Neuroi was destroyed.

381
00:23:11,916 --> 00:23:13,458
Major...! What about them?

382
00:23:13,541 --> 00:23:15,458
No need to worry.
They're both fine.

383
00:23:17,416 --> 00:23:20,833
No, it can't be!
She's wearing the Shinden!

384
00:23:20,916 --> 00:23:22,333
They completed it?!

385
00:23:25,583 --> 00:23:27,666
So this is Fuso's newest unit?

386
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:30,000
The J7W1 Shinden...

387
00:23:30,083 --> 00:23:32,375
I'd heard it'd suffered
development setbacks...

388
00:23:32,458 --> 00:23:35,166
but it sounds like Doctor
Miyafuji's letter helped

389
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:36,500
it reach completion.

390
00:23:36,583 --> 00:23:38,666
Really...?
That kinda sounds like

391
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:41,291
it was made
specifically for her...

392
00:23:41,375 --> 00:23:43,166
So, where are the
two heroes, anyway?

393
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:45,333
Oh... Both girls are asleep...

394
00:23:45,416 --> 00:23:48,083
I can't necessarily blame
either of them, though...

395
00:23:48,166 --> 00:23:49,583
They were spent.

396
00:23:49,666 --> 00:23:51,416
Well, this is
certainly impressive...

397
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:53,916
I'm guessing Miyafuji's old
Striker Unit couldn't handle

398
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,166
her magic energy because
she's grown so much stronger...

399
00:23:57,250 --> 00:24:00,000
Yes. It appears
the limiter kicked in

400
00:24:00,083 --> 00:24:02,125
to prevent damage
to the magic engine.

401
00:24:02,208 --> 00:24:04,291
That won't be a
problem with this Shinden.

402
00:24:04,375 --> 00:24:07,166
It should be able to
use Miyafuji's full power.

403
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:10,750
Well, she's not a
beginner anymore, huh?

404
00:25:59,875 --> 00:26:01,750
My homeland of
Gallia has yet to heal

405
00:26:01,833 --> 00:26:03,666
from the ravages of war...

406
00:26:03,750 --> 00:26:07,291
But the people live cheerfully,
with hope for the future...

407
00:26:07,375 --> 00:26:10,875
On the next Strike Witches 2:
"The Bridge to Tomorrow."
