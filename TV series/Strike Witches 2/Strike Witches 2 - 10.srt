1
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:43,833
Reppuzan!

2
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:06,541
Then it's true...
I can't stop it.

3
00:01:10,333 --> 00:01:13,333
It appears the Battleship Yamato
managed to arrive safely.

4
00:01:13,416 --> 00:01:14,708
That fact alone should be enough

5
00:01:14,791 --> 00:01:16,750
to vindicate the choice
to reestablish the

6
00:01:16,833 --> 00:01:19,208
Five Hundred and
First Joint Fighter Wing.

7
00:01:19,291 --> 00:01:21,500
I'd been told its
purpose was to increase

8
00:01:21,583 --> 00:01:23,500
our military readiness
in this region...

9
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:25,500
is there something
more to it than that?

10
00:01:26,416 --> 00:01:28,833
Now listen, Lieutenant
Colonel Minna...

11
00:01:28,916 --> 00:01:31,625
Operation Trajan was our
last attempt to make contact

12
00:01:31,708 --> 00:01:34,083
with the Neuroi,
and it ended in failure...

13
00:01:34,166 --> 00:01:37,416
Any possibility of
coexistence has disappeared.

14
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,500
There are two
options before us...

15
00:01:39,583 --> 00:01:41,958
we can either
kill or be killed...

16
00:01:42,041 --> 00:01:43,291
and we'll need more

17
00:01:43,375 --> 00:01:46,500
than just the Strike Witches
to exterminate them.

18
00:01:46,583 --> 00:01:48,541
So that's why you
need the Yamato?

19
00:01:48,625 --> 00:01:50,791
That's all we're cleared
to tell you at this time.

20
00:01:50,875 --> 00:01:52,375
But on another subject...

21
00:01:52,458 --> 00:01:55,750
I understand you'd like approval
for a new tactical operation.

22
00:01:55,833 --> 00:01:58,125
Yes... I'd like to
send specific teams

23
00:01:58,208 --> 00:02:00,000
of Witches to strike the Neuroi.

24
00:02:00,083 --> 00:02:03,291
You have our approval
pending one simple addition,

25
00:02:03,375 --> 00:02:05,666
which we think will
be very beneficial.

26
00:02:06,916 --> 00:02:08,500
You may come in now.

27
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:14,833
It can't be.

28
00:03:52,791 --> 00:03:54,833
Hartmann! Get up right now!

29
00:04:01,291 --> 00:04:02,958
Sleepy.

30
00:04:03,041 --> 00:04:04,166
You have to train...

31
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:05,958
The mission could
be green lit any minute.

32
00:04:06,041 --> 00:04:08,083
We have a mission?

33
00:04:08,166 --> 00:04:10,833
Minna's discussing the details
with the top brass right now...

34
00:04:10,916 --> 00:04:12,375
When they approve it,

35
00:04:12,458 --> 00:04:14,250
the two of us will
probably be chosen to fight.

36
00:04:15,416 --> 00:04:17,250
Why just us?

37
00:04:26,375 --> 00:04:27,583
A transport.

38
00:04:27,916 --> 00:04:29,875
That's a Ju 52, to be exact.

39
00:04:29,958 --> 00:04:32,291
Commander Minna
must be back already.

40
00:04:38,458 --> 00:04:40,291
She jumped.

41
00:04:40,375 --> 00:04:41,541
That's crazy.

42
00:04:49,916 --> 00:04:50,625
Wow.

43
00:04:50,708 --> 00:04:52,333
You are so cool.

44
00:04:52,416 --> 00:04:56,750
Thanks... It's a pleasure to
meet you, my little kittens.

45
00:04:56,833 --> 00:04:57,833
We're kittens?

46
00:04:57,916 --> 00:05:00,000
Wow.

47
00:05:02,083 --> 00:05:05,291
Sorry, kids... but I don't
like to give out autographs.

48
00:05:05,375 --> 00:05:06,791
Okay... thanks?

49
00:05:06,875 --> 00:05:07,958
Wow.

50
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:09,291
Maybe you two can help me.

51
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:10,625
The great Marseille.

52
00:05:10,708 --> 00:05:12,208
Why are you here?

53
00:05:12,291 --> 00:05:14,916
I thought that you were
supposed to be in Africa.

54
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:19,083
Is that Hartmann,
I see...? All right!

55
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:22,791
When's the last time I saw you?

56
00:05:22,875 --> 00:05:24,166
Was it flight school?

57
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:26,625
No, it was with
JG 52's Group IV...

58
00:05:26,708 --> 00:05:28,333
Do you remember
that total bitch,

59
00:05:28,416 --> 00:05:30,625
the commanding officer
we had we couldn't stand?

60
00:05:30,708 --> 00:05:32,625
You know, the one with the
anger issues and bad breath?

61
00:05:32,708 --> 00:05:33,708
What was her name again?

62
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:35,125
It was Barkhorn

63
00:05:35,208 --> 00:05:38,791
Exactly... Oh...! It's so
good to see you, Barkhorn.

64
00:05:39,166 --> 00:05:40,541
How are you?

65
00:05:42,333 --> 00:05:44,000
Angry. Can't you smell?

66
00:05:44,083 --> 00:05:45,500
That girl is so cool...

67
00:05:45,583 --> 00:05:47,875
She and Lieutenant Barkhorn
look like best friends.

68
00:05:47,958 --> 00:05:50,125
I don't think you know
what you're talking about.

69
00:05:53,458 --> 00:05:57,375
Man, she's gonna make
things suck around here.

70
00:06:03,458 --> 00:06:05,958
Look. That girl is famous.
She's in a book.

71
00:06:06,041 --> 00:06:08,166
Let me see. 'Karlsland
has many heroes,

72
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:10,291
but none brighter than
Captain Hannah Marseille.

73
00:06:10,375 --> 00:06:12,833
'She is a member of
the 31st Air Squadron,

74
00:06:12,916 --> 00:06:15,458
also known as the Storm
Witches, and an elite ace

75
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:18,541
made famous for shooting
down over 200 enemy aircraft.'

76
00:06:18,625 --> 00:06:21,125
Two hundred...?! No way.

77
00:06:21,208 --> 00:06:22,583
'She is known in Karlsland

78
00:06:22,666 --> 00:06:25,041
for her beauty as
much as for her skills...

79
00:06:25,125 --> 00:06:27,583
And both help to spread her
fame throughout the world...

80
00:06:27,666 --> 00:06:30,541
She's called the
'Star of Africa'... Oh wow.

81
00:06:30,625 --> 00:06:31,916
The Star of Africa...?

82
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,375
That's so cool...
I so want her autograph.

83
00:06:35,458 --> 00:06:38,166
She doesn't do autographs.

84
00:06:38,875 --> 00:06:39,958
Did you know her?

85
00:06:40,041 --> 00:06:42,083
Tell us everything
you can about Marseille.

86
00:06:42,166 --> 00:06:44,458
Well, Francesca and
I were stationed in Africa

87
00:06:44,541 --> 00:06:46,625
for a little while
before we ended up here.

88
00:06:46,708 --> 00:06:47,750
It's true.

89
00:06:47,833 --> 00:06:49,541
Is she amazing or awesome?

90
00:06:49,625 --> 00:06:51,500
We mostly just heard rumors

91
00:06:51,583 --> 00:06:53,125
Rumors... That's right.

92
00:06:53,208 --> 00:06:57,291
The other girls from Karlsland
probably know more about her.

93
00:06:58,083 --> 00:07:01,125
That's right... She told us
you were in the same squad.

94
00:07:01,208 --> 00:07:02,791
Yes, we were in
the same squadron

95
00:07:02,875 --> 00:07:04,541
with the 'Star of Africa'...

96
00:07:04,625 --> 00:07:06,583
of course, that was
back in Karlsland.

97
00:07:06,666 --> 00:07:08,833
Then you guys have
to be good friends.

98
00:07:08,916 --> 00:07:10,666
Friends with that snob...?

99
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:12,833
You have no idea what
you're talking about.

100
00:07:14,708 --> 00:07:15,791
Okay. Listen up.

101
00:07:15,875 --> 00:07:18,291
I will select two
Witches to infiltrate

102
00:07:18,375 --> 00:07:19,916
and then break through here...

103
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,791
They'll take out the
Neuroi defenses...

104
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:25,000
and then destroy
the core. Questions?

105
00:07:25,083 --> 00:07:27,375
Yes, ma'am... Why only two?

106
00:07:27,458 --> 00:07:28,875
Our transport's a sub...

107
00:07:28,958 --> 00:07:30,833
Storage space is very limited...

108
00:07:30,916 --> 00:07:34,458
So there is only enough room
for two Witches with Strikers.

109
00:07:34,541 --> 00:07:37,125
The only thing you all care
about is who got picked, right?

110
00:07:37,208 --> 00:07:38,708
Here goes...

111
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:42,250
Assigned to us on a temporary
basis, the first Witch picked,

112
00:07:42,333 --> 00:07:45,875
is Captain Hannah Marseille,
from the 31st Air Squadron.

113
00:07:45,958 --> 00:07:48,125
This is an outrage
and an insult--

114
00:07:48,208 --> 00:07:50,666
that assault team was supposed
to be me and Hartmann.

115
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:53,625
These orders come
straight from the top...

116
00:07:53,708 --> 00:07:56,208
Only one member of
the 501st will participate

117
00:07:56,291 --> 00:07:57,583
in the operation...

118
00:07:57,666 --> 00:08:00,041
That person isyou,
Captain Barkhorn.

119
00:08:00,125 --> 00:08:01,583
No thank you.

120
00:08:01,666 --> 00:08:05,000
Barkhorn. You're not good
enough to be my partner.

121
00:08:05,083 --> 00:08:06,916
What?

122
00:08:09,916 --> 00:08:11,208
And why not?

123
00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:13,791
What are you trying
to say... exactly?

124
00:08:13,875 --> 00:08:15,291
I'll spell it out...

125
00:08:15,375 --> 00:08:17,750
You lack the flying ability
and combat skills necessary

126
00:08:17,833 --> 00:08:19,333
to keep up with me in battle.

127
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:20,583
That's enough.

128
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:23,083
There's only one person
here who can match me.

129
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:29,083
I'm not done with
you yet, Marseille...

130
00:08:29,166 --> 00:08:30,541
As long as I've known you,

131
00:08:30,625 --> 00:08:32,083
you've never had
the proper respect

132
00:08:32,166 --> 00:08:35,208
for your superior officers,
but I'm about to change that.

133
00:08:35,291 --> 00:08:36,500
Oh?

134
00:08:36,583 --> 00:08:38,083
Lieutenant.

135
00:08:38,791 --> 00:08:39,583
That's bad.

136
00:08:39,666 --> 00:08:40,666
What should we do?

137
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:42,083
Stand down, Captain.

138
00:08:42,166 --> 00:08:44,666
Oh, but we're same rank now.

139
00:08:58,875 --> 00:09:00,250
Take it outside.

140
00:09:00,333 --> 00:09:01,791
Stop, both of you.

141
00:09:02,666 --> 00:09:05,583
Stop.

142
00:09:05,666 --> 00:09:08,125
All this is just to get me
to be your partner...

143
00:09:08,208 --> 00:09:09,541
So I'll do it.

144
00:09:14,125 --> 00:09:15,791
Are you sure, Lieutenant?

145
00:09:15,875 --> 00:09:17,041
Hartmann.

146
00:09:17,125 --> 00:09:18,500
Well that's better...

147
00:09:18,583 --> 00:09:21,208
Now I'm excited... aren't you?

148
00:09:39,958 --> 00:09:41,583
They're amazing up there.

149
00:09:41,666 --> 00:09:44,541
Well, with the giant egos they
both have, they'd better be.

150
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:45,625
That's right...

151
00:09:45,708 --> 00:09:47,500
They're both squadron aces.

152
00:09:47,583 --> 00:09:50,000
Correct. This is the
first joint operation

153
00:09:50,083 --> 00:09:52,500
between two top aces
from separate squadrons.

154
00:09:52,583 --> 00:09:56,125
That's exactly why the Allied
Brass like the idea so much...

155
00:09:56,208 --> 00:09:58,000
They're scoring points
with the public

156
00:09:58,083 --> 00:09:59,791
by throwing Captain
Marseille in the mix.

157
00:09:59,875 --> 00:10:03,125
True... if it helps with the
mission, then I don't care...

158
00:10:03,208 --> 00:10:05,833
but I'm not very convinced
of that so far...

159
00:10:05,916 --> 00:10:08,125
They've still got a
lot of synching up to do.

160
00:10:08,208 --> 00:10:11,583
Agreed... They don't seem
to be clicking just yet.

161
00:10:21,208 --> 00:10:23,583
And that's nine wins for me.

162
00:10:26,791 --> 00:10:29,125
Ow! I've been hit!

163
00:10:30,916 --> 00:10:33,000
You just terminated
the exercise.

164
00:10:33,083 --> 00:10:35,041
Return to base at once.

165
00:10:35,541 --> 00:10:37,541
Yeah, sure.

166
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:43,708
What do you
think that was about?

167
00:10:43,791 --> 00:10:46,833
Dunno... I couldn't
see what was happening.

168
00:11:00,375 --> 00:11:02,000
The two of you are
confined to this room

169
00:11:02,083 --> 00:11:04,166
until the day of the operation.

170
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:05,416
Captain Marseille...

171
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:08,291
Normally, you'd be
thrown in the stockade

172
00:11:08,375 --> 00:11:10,625
for pointing a gun at someone
during a training exercise.

173
00:11:10,708 --> 00:11:13,125
Unfortunately, we don't
have one on this base.

174
00:11:13,208 --> 00:11:16,791
Instead... I get to confine
the both of you to your room.

175
00:11:17,125 --> 00:11:19,666
Man... What did I
do to deserve this?

176
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:21,125
Acted stupid...

177
00:11:21,208 --> 00:11:23,166
so this will give you two
some time to figure out how

178
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:25,541
to become a team for
the upcoming mission...

179
00:11:25,625 --> 00:11:27,000
Is that clear?

180
00:11:27,083 --> 00:11:28,416
Understood.

181
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:29,625
I got it.

182
00:11:29,708 --> 00:11:32,125
Pull that again and
you're in real trouble.

183
00:11:38,583 --> 00:11:41,333
You know this whole
thing is your fault, right?

184
00:11:42,666 --> 00:11:44,916
Minna can be pretty scary, huh?

185
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,291
You should see how she
gets when she's actually mad.

186
00:11:53,083 --> 00:11:55,125
So, why didn't you fight back?

187
00:11:55,958 --> 00:11:57,750
I had my gun
aimed right at you...

188
00:11:57,833 --> 00:11:59,333
with the way you fly,
you could've countered

189
00:11:59,416 --> 00:12:01,166
and been on
my six in a heartbeat.

190
00:12:02,583 --> 00:12:04,583
Hannah, you haven't
changed at all.

191
00:12:04,666 --> 00:12:06,416
And why should I have to change?

192
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:09,791
Not everything in life
has to be a competition.

193
00:12:09,875 --> 00:12:11,666
Winning is the only
thing that matters

194
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:12,958
when you're on
the battlefield...

195
00:12:13,041 --> 00:12:14,541
That's why I always
have to make sure

196
00:12:14,625 --> 00:12:17,750
I'm the best in everything
that I do... Understand?

197
00:12:17,833 --> 00:12:19,125
That's crazy.

198
00:12:19,208 --> 00:12:20,375
When you left the squadron,

199
00:12:20,458 --> 00:12:23,083
we were still tied eight
kills to eight kills...

200
00:12:23,166 --> 00:12:25,458
You're the only one
who's ever been my equal.

201
00:12:25,541 --> 00:12:27,333
After this... that ends.

202
00:12:27,416 --> 00:12:29,708
This mission is
gonna settle that...

203
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:31,791
And you will be the loser.

204
00:12:34,875 --> 00:12:36,666
Fine. I forfeit. You win.

205
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:39,458
Again? That's exactly
what you said last time

206
00:12:39,541 --> 00:12:42,333
before you ran off...
You coward.

207
00:12:42,416 --> 00:12:44,583
Think what you want...

208
00:13:01,375 --> 00:13:03,041
Winner... Captain Marseille.

209
00:13:10,666 --> 00:13:12,250
I win again.

210
00:13:13,791 --> 00:13:14,583
I want some more.

211
00:13:14,666 --> 00:13:16,041
Right away.

212
00:13:17,541 --> 00:13:19,875
So, do you like Fuso cooking?

213
00:13:19,958 --> 00:13:22,000
Yeah... We've gotta
Witch from Fuso

214
00:13:22,083 --> 00:13:24,416
who cooks for my squadron,
too, so ya know.

215
00:13:28,916 --> 00:13:30,500
But I can't stand that stuff.

216
00:13:30,583 --> 00:13:33,708
Really? But natto
is so good for you.

217
00:13:34,125 --> 00:13:35,166
More rice.

218
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:38,000
There isn't any rice left.

219
00:13:38,458 --> 00:13:39,375
What's that?

220
00:13:39,458 --> 00:13:42,208
I ate more than you! Ha!

221
00:13:49,083 --> 00:13:50,375
Two more wins for me.

222
00:13:50,458 --> 00:13:52,458
And two more
I don't care's for me.

223
00:13:52,541 --> 00:13:54,458
Winning is the first
priority of any soldier.

224
00:13:54,541 --> 00:13:57,000
I told you, I'm not
competing with you.

225
00:13:57,083 --> 00:13:58,083
Too bad...

226
00:13:58,166 --> 00:13:59,541
With an attitude like that,

227
00:13:59,625 --> 00:14:01,541
you're gonna be stuck as a
lieutenant forever, ya know.

228
00:14:01,625 --> 00:14:03,708
Which would be really
sad if I cared.

229
00:14:07,208 --> 00:14:08,791
I could so get used to this...

230
00:14:08,875 --> 00:14:11,166
a hot bath completely
relaxes me...

231
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:12,875
They're what
I dreamed they'd be like

232
00:14:12,958 --> 00:14:14,583
ever since I first
heard about them.

233
00:14:14,666 --> 00:14:16,916
You don't have baths in Africa?

234
00:14:18,166 --> 00:14:19,583
Not even one...

235
00:14:19,666 --> 00:14:22,083
A drop of water is
precious in Africa...

236
00:14:22,166 --> 00:14:24,375
So, we could never
waste it like this.

237
00:14:26,375 --> 00:14:27,750
That must be rough.

238
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:30,375
Yeah... but Africa's great.

239
00:14:30,458 --> 00:14:32,583
There are no commanding
officers to ride you,

240
00:14:32,666 --> 00:14:34,166
and the Allied Command
is so far away

241
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:36,250
they almost never bother us.

242
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:39,583
So why did they decide to send
you off on this mission then?

243
00:14:39,666 --> 00:14:41,875
Well... they wanted
to get people excited

244
00:14:41,958 --> 00:14:43,958
about the war again,
which is fine...

245
00:14:48,041 --> 00:14:50,583
It seems like a pretty small
price for me to pay...

246
00:14:50,666 --> 00:14:52,333
to protect them.

247
00:14:56,916 --> 00:14:58,583
Besides...
there's a certain girl

248
00:14:58,666 --> 00:15:01,250
named Erica Hartmann
I wanted to see again.

249
00:15:01,625 --> 00:15:03,041
You're so nuts.

250
00:15:05,458 --> 00:15:08,083
Oh, hi Captain
Marseille and Hartmann.

251
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:12,083
So, how do you feel
after your first bath?

252
00:15:12,541 --> 00:15:13,875
Everything I thought it'd be.

253
00:15:15,208 --> 00:15:16,333
It's inspection time!

254
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:17,125
Stop that...

255
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:18,375
Those are not yours.

256
00:15:18,458 --> 00:15:20,500
Ooh...! So big.

257
00:15:20,583 --> 00:15:23,333
But, I'm afraid
Shirley still has you beat.

258
00:15:26,083 --> 00:15:28,333
No way...
You can't out-boob me.

259
00:15:28,416 --> 00:15:31,333
Look...Mine have an upward lift.

260
00:15:32,875 --> 00:15:34,750
What good are
those unjiggly jugs?

261
00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:36,333
It's better than
having old lady bags.

262
00:15:36,416 --> 00:15:37,500
Can an old lady do this?

263
00:15:37,583 --> 00:15:38,791
This is awesome.

264
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:42,291
Ya mean weird.

265
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:44,416
Unbelievable.

266
00:15:55,625 --> 00:15:56,458
Morning...

267
00:15:56,541 --> 00:15:57,750
Hey, what's that ya got there?

268
00:15:57,833 --> 00:15:59,750
Uh... it's nothing...

269
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:02,791
I just... It's not even for me.

270
00:16:02,875 --> 00:16:06,875
Wait... Don't tell me you're
getting Hannah's autograph?

271
00:16:08,458 --> 00:16:09,500
It's for my sister...

272
00:16:09,583 --> 00:16:11,583
She's a really big
fan of Marseille's.

273
00:16:11,666 --> 00:16:12,750
That makes sense.

274
00:16:12,833 --> 00:16:14,666
Yeah... I thought
maybe it'd cheer her up

275
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:16,291
next time I saw her.

276
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:18,791
That's sweet... Lemme ask her.

277
00:16:20,625 --> 00:16:21,666
I thought you knew.

278
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:23,875
I never give out
autographs to anyone.

279
00:16:23,958 --> 00:16:25,500
Do you think it's
really gonna kill you

280
00:16:25,583 --> 00:16:28,041
to sign an autograph or two?

281
00:16:30,333 --> 00:16:31,750
No, but you'd have to shoot me

282
00:16:31,833 --> 00:16:34,666
to get me to sign an
autograph for her sister.

283
00:16:38,208 --> 00:16:39,583
You're terrible...

284
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:41,666
What did Trudy ever do to you?

285
00:16:44,083 --> 00:16:45,958
Start competing
with me for real...

286
00:16:46,041 --> 00:16:48,625
Win and I'll give you all
the autographs you want.

287
00:16:48,708 --> 00:16:50,791
If I beat you, you'll do it?

288
00:16:50,875 --> 00:16:52,708
Absolutely.

289
00:16:56,125 --> 00:16:57,250
It's time to go.

290
00:17:27,291 --> 00:17:28,375
Come in...

291
00:17:28,458 --> 00:17:30,583
Captain Marseille,
Hartmann... do you copy?

292
00:17:30,666 --> 00:17:31,958
Yeah, loud and clear.

293
00:17:39,958 --> 00:17:41,875
Your target is on
the island of Malta,

294
00:17:41,958 --> 00:17:43,875
which has been taken
over by the Neuroi...

295
00:17:43,958 --> 00:17:46,041
Our Intel has it that
these are the same Neuroi

296
00:17:46,125 --> 00:17:48,583
that recently attacked
the Fuso fleet.

297
00:17:52,208 --> 00:17:53,958
The recon photos showed that the

298
00:17:54,041 --> 00:17:56,625
Neuroi's fortifications topside
are nearly impenetrable.

299
00:17:56,708 --> 00:17:59,000
The submarine will sneak
you under the main defense,

300
00:17:59,083 --> 00:18:00,791
and you'll destroy
it from the inside.

301
00:18:00,875 --> 00:18:02,125
Are you both ready?

302
00:18:02,208 --> 00:18:03,541
Oh I'm always ready.

303
00:18:03,625 --> 00:18:05,416
We're a go, commander.

304
00:18:06,666 --> 00:18:08,166
You're cleared for takeoff.

305
00:18:15,791 --> 00:18:16,833
Let's go.

306
00:18:26,291 --> 00:18:27,541
There are too many.

307
00:18:28,458 --> 00:18:30,541
I count forty bogeys engaged.

308
00:18:30,625 --> 00:18:32,041
Did she say forty?

309
00:18:32,125 --> 00:18:33,500
Yes, she did.

310
00:18:33,583 --> 00:18:34,625
No, thirty-eight!

311
00:18:34,708 --> 00:18:36,458
Make that thirty-five.

312
00:18:36,541 --> 00:18:38,041
Can't they count?

313
00:18:38,125 --> 00:18:43,041
They're just keeping us
updated... as the numbers fall.

314
00:18:43,125 --> 00:18:45,750
They're shooting them
down all by themselves.

315
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:47,541
Twenty-eight.

316
00:18:47,625 --> 00:18:48,833
Twenty-five.

317
00:18:51,041 --> 00:18:52,333
Twenty-one now.

318
00:18:53,041 --> 00:18:54,833
Ten.

319
00:19:00,958 --> 00:19:02,125
Seven.

320
00:19:02,583 --> 00:19:03,375
Six.

321
00:19:03,458 --> 00:19:04,875
Five.

322
00:19:04,958 --> 00:19:05,833
Four.

323
00:19:05,916 --> 00:19:06,708
Three.

324
00:19:06,791 --> 00:19:08,416
Two.

325
00:19:09,958 --> 00:19:11,083
Zero.

326
00:19:11,833 --> 00:19:13,416
That just leaves the core.

327
00:19:14,291 --> 00:19:15,125
Me first...

328
00:19:15,208 --> 00:19:16,375
No way!

329
00:19:24,208 --> 00:19:26,458
They got it. Look.

330
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:28,958
Wow. With only the two of them.

331
00:19:29,041 --> 00:19:30,250
I took down 20.

332
00:19:30,333 --> 00:19:32,125
That's exactly what I got.

333
00:19:32,916 --> 00:19:34,041
I don't like ties.

334
00:19:34,125 --> 00:19:35,750
You never have.

335
00:19:35,833 --> 00:19:37,666
Let's settle this right here.

336
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:41,333
You better give me your
autograph when I win.

337
00:19:41,416 --> 00:19:42,750
You mean 'if'.

338
00:19:46,041 --> 00:19:46,916
What now?

339
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,458
I thought they were finished.

340
00:20:04,833 --> 00:20:06,666
She's shooting.

341
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:08,666
But she hasn't hit her yet.

342
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:09,875
That girl.

343
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:12,208
Shooting each other's
against regulations!

344
00:20:12,291 --> 00:20:14,708
Looks like they're
never going to change.

345
00:20:14,791 --> 00:20:16,916
Aren't you supposed
to be freaking out?

346
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,708
They're live rounds!

347
00:20:18,791 --> 00:20:20,208
Yeah, and they're witches...

348
00:20:20,291 --> 00:20:22,875
they have their shields to
protect themselves if they want.

349
00:20:22,958 --> 00:20:24,750
Yeah. Great... I feel better.

350
00:20:24,833 --> 00:20:27,166
They're trying to find
out who's the best...

351
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:29,666
if you use your shield
or run out of ammo...

352
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:33,750
that's it... you have to
concede to the better fighter.

353
00:20:49,083 --> 00:20:51,083
Marseille used a chandelle
to keep her in check,

354
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:52,250
and now Hartmann's using

355
00:20:52,333 --> 00:20:54,375
a high G barrel roll
to flip behind her.

356
00:20:55,583 --> 00:20:56,791
Amazing.

357
00:21:03,166 --> 00:21:04,125
Now you're mine.

358
00:21:06,291 --> 00:21:08,416
Sturm Attack.

359
00:21:26,333 --> 00:21:27,000
No ammo.

360
00:21:27,083 --> 00:21:28,750
Same with me.

361
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:30,458
I guess it's a draw.

362
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:36,458
This'll never end
with them... Great.

363
00:21:54,458 --> 00:21:57,208
Oh, I've been
looking for that one.

364
00:21:58,708 --> 00:22:00,333
There has got to be
something seriously wrong

365
00:22:00,416 --> 00:22:01,625
with your head.

366
00:22:01,708 --> 00:22:04,125
I've never seen you
clean up this room before.

367
00:22:04,208 --> 00:22:05,750
I'm really sorry...

368
00:22:05,833 --> 00:22:08,208
I just couldn't get an
autograph from Hannah.

369
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:13,375
That's okay... It's fine.

370
00:22:16,291 --> 00:22:17,708
Why are you in such a rush?

371
00:22:17,791 --> 00:22:19,791
It's because I have
a magazine interview

372
00:22:19,875 --> 00:22:21,041
back home this afternoon.

373
00:22:21,125 --> 00:22:23,458
Nothing the "Star of Africa"
can't handle.

374
00:22:23,541 --> 00:22:25,708
One more thing...
I almost forgot.

375
00:22:27,666 --> 00:22:30,000
Could you send this to
Barkhorn's sister for me?

376
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,041
Why can't you just
give it to her yourself?

377
00:22:35,625 --> 00:22:37,166
I told you.

378
00:22:38,958 --> 00:22:40,666
I have a busy schedule.

379
00:22:49,291 --> 00:22:50,958
This is too much work.

380
00:22:54,125 --> 00:22:55,583
Nooo!

381
00:24:29,625 --> 00:24:32,666
The final showdown with
the Neuroi is nearly here.

382
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:34,125
But we're the Strike Witches...

383
00:24:34,208 --> 00:24:36,708
We'll never stop fighting.

384
00:24:37,333 --> 00:24:40,458
On the next Strike Witches 2:
"To Be Myself."
