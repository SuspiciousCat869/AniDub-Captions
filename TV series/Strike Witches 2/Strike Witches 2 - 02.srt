1
00:00:19,708 --> 00:00:23,083
In the spring of 1945, a
new type of Neuroi suddenly

2
00:00:23,166 --> 00:00:25,666
appeared in the
skies above Venezia...

3
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:30,500
Instantly, Fuso Witches Yoshika
Miyafuji and Mio Sakamoto left

4
00:00:30,583 --> 00:00:34,083
for Europe to stand up to
this new, mysterious menace...

5
00:00:34,166 --> 00:00:36,041
However, just
before their arrival,

6
00:00:36,125 --> 00:00:38,458
a different Neuroi
appeared before the girls

7
00:00:38,541 --> 00:00:41,750
and attacked, perhaps in
an attempt to delay them.

8
00:00:41,833 --> 00:00:43,208
But will it work?

9
00:02:40,708 --> 00:02:42,125
Neuroi confirmed...!

10
00:02:42,208 --> 00:02:44,291
There...! At about
twelve thousand!

11
00:02:44,375 --> 00:02:45,708
Damn it...!

12
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:48,000
I can't believe they've
extended their reach this far!

13
00:02:57,833 --> 00:02:59,041
Hijikata!

14
00:02:59,916 --> 00:03:01,250
Hijikata!

15
00:03:10,291 --> 00:03:12,125
Her magic energy
is stable now...

16
00:03:12,208 --> 00:03:14,250
You've certainly
improved, Miyafuji

17
00:03:15,625 --> 00:03:16,750
We need to move out...!

18
00:03:16,833 --> 00:03:18,666
Let's drop altitude
and try to lose them!

19
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:19,791
Roger!

20
00:03:25,291 --> 00:03:27,125
Where are you going?

21
00:03:27,458 --> 00:03:28,208
How does it look?!

22
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:29,250
You think we can lose them?!

23
00:03:29,333 --> 00:03:31,333
We're doin' everything
we can here!

24
00:03:31,416 --> 00:03:32,333
Well keep trying!

25
00:03:32,416 --> 00:03:33,583
What's happening?

26
00:03:35,208 --> 00:03:37,208
You didn't think I was going to
lead us out there, did you...?

27
00:03:37,291 --> 00:03:38,750
Not to worry...!

28
00:03:38,833 --> 00:03:41,083
We're planning to evade for
now and wait for reinforcements.

29
00:03:41,166 --> 00:03:42,458
Right!

30
00:03:48,458 --> 00:03:50,458
Neuroi spotted...!
Straight ahead!

31
00:03:50,541 --> 00:03:52,333
All ships to third
Battle Speed...!

32
00:03:52,416 --> 00:03:54,250
Bear down... Neuroi spotted!

33
00:03:54,333 --> 00:03:56,375
All ships to third
Battle Speed...! Mark!

34
00:03:56,458 --> 00:03:58,500
Prepare for battle!

35
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Commence fire!

36
00:04:13,125 --> 00:04:16,875
Amazing... The Neuroi incendiary
shells are so powerful...!

37
00:04:16,958 --> 00:04:18,416
Prepare to attack!

38
00:04:20,916 --> 00:04:21,875
What's that?!

39
00:04:24,333 --> 00:04:25,958
Ready, fire!

40
00:04:32,583 --> 00:04:33,666
Did we get it?

41
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:35,250
Wow...

42
00:04:35,333 --> 00:04:38,250
It's not going to be enough to
take down a Neuroi of that size.

43
00:04:38,333 --> 00:04:40,291
From here it looks
like it's taking a hit,

44
00:04:40,375 --> 00:04:42,791
but they won't be
able to reach its core!

45
00:04:48,625 --> 00:04:50,208
It just took out a destroyer!

46
00:04:50,291 --> 00:04:52,333
Sergeant...! Where are
the Romagna Witches?!

47
00:04:52,416 --> 00:04:53,875
Not coming...!

48
00:04:53,958 --> 00:04:55,708
I requested help from Romagna's
First Fighter Wing earlier,

49
00:04:55,791 --> 00:04:58,333
but unfortunately we're now
outside of their flight range.

50
00:04:58,416 --> 00:05:00,333
We're going to have to
figure something else out.

51
00:05:03,708 --> 00:05:04,708
They got another one!

52
00:05:04,791 --> 00:05:06,375
They're taking
too long to escape...!

53
00:05:06,458 --> 00:05:07,750
They're like sitting ducks!

54
00:05:07,833 --> 00:05:09,916
The Five Hundred and Fourth
Fighter Wing is close...

55
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,708
but they're unable to fight...

56
00:05:11,791 --> 00:05:13,208
Yesterday's battle
wiped them out...!

57
00:05:13,291 --> 00:05:16,208
And all other Witch units
will be at least thirty minutes.

58
00:05:16,291 --> 00:05:17,916
We don't have thirty minutes...

59
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,166
At the rate we're going,
we'll be wiped out in five!

60
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:21,458
Are you serious?!

61
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:42,958
I'm ready, Hijikata!

62
00:05:43,041 --> 00:05:44,125
Right!

63
00:05:56,916 --> 00:05:58,208
Major...!

64
00:06:02,583 --> 00:06:03,958
Major, are you hurt?!

65
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,541
It didn't hit me if that's
what you're asking...

66
00:06:07,625 --> 00:06:11,125
But, my shield doesn't have
the strength that it used to.

67
00:06:11,208 --> 00:06:12,500
I'm sorry.

68
00:06:12,583 --> 00:06:15,791
How am I supposed to block
a Neuroi beam with that?

69
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,250
That's it...! Hijikata, I'll be
taking some time off soon.

70
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,250
I'm heading out!

71
00:06:37,333 --> 00:06:38,416
Roger that...!

72
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:39,666
Prepare to launch striker!

73
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:43,375
Shiden Model
Fifty-Three is ready to go!

74
00:06:43,458 --> 00:06:45,208
No. Wait! You can't!

75
00:06:45,291 --> 00:06:47,041
Out of the way, Miyafuji!

76
00:06:47,125 --> 00:06:48,333
No, ma'am...!

77
00:06:48,416 --> 00:06:51,375
I know that you can't
create shields anymore!

78
00:06:51,458 --> 00:06:54,125
You can't fly...!
I won't let you!

79
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:58,208
This certainly brings
back memories.

80
00:06:58,291 --> 00:07:00,000
You tried to stop me
like this once before.

81
00:07:00,083 --> 00:07:02,208
I'll be fine.
You don't have to worry...

82
00:07:02,291 --> 00:07:05,541
I promise I have no intention
of losing my life out there.

83
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:06,791
Yeah, but...

84
00:07:06,875 --> 00:07:09,916
It's true... I lost the
ability to use shields

85
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,416
when I turned twenty.

86
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:14,666
But I now have a newly repaired
Shiden Fifty-Three unit...

87
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:15,875
and this here.

88
00:07:15,958 --> 00:07:18,208
I haven't forgotten
how you saved my life...

89
00:07:18,291 --> 00:07:20,583
and I'm not going to throw
it away that easily...

90
00:07:20,666 --> 00:07:23,791
You're just gonna have to
trust me... I am able to fight.

91
00:07:23,875 --> 00:07:25,916
If that's the case,
then I have a request...

92
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,083
Will you let me fight
this battle with you?

93
00:07:32,541 --> 00:07:34,833
Right...! Get ready
to go, Sergeant!

94
00:07:34,916 --> 00:07:36,750
Right!

95
00:07:37,291 --> 00:07:38,750
Miyafuji...! You take the lead

96
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:41,000
and draw the Neuroi away
from the Venezian fleet...!

97
00:07:41,083 --> 00:07:43,166
I'll go after the core
and attack from the rear!

98
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:45,291
Got it!

99
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:56,250
Let's go...! Prepare flight!

100
00:07:56,333 --> 00:07:57,916
Right...! Roger that!

101
00:08:07,166 --> 00:08:08,250
Sakamoto!

102
00:08:08,333 --> 00:08:10,333
I'm fine! It only
hit the liftoff unit...!

103
00:08:10,416 --> 00:08:12,416
Look out...!
The next one's coming!

104
00:08:15,916 --> 00:08:17,041
What was that?!

105
00:08:17,125 --> 00:08:18,916
Wow...! Did you see
the size of her shield?!

106
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Of course! That's
how powerful she is!

107
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:23,375
Major! I'm afraid the magic
charger's been damaged

108
00:08:23,458 --> 00:08:25,500
and The Shiden-Kai
won't be able to fly!

109
00:08:25,583 --> 00:08:27,000
Whaddaya mean?!

110
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:29,958
We want food! We want food!

111
00:08:30,041 --> 00:08:32,208
We need supplies!
We need supplies!

112
00:08:32,291 --> 00:08:33,500
Yummy, yummy Fuso food!

113
00:08:33,583 --> 00:08:35,250
You got me at Fuso food!

114
00:08:35,333 --> 00:08:38,500
Can't wait to eat rice
with octopus carpaccio!

115
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:41,541
Then you lost me at 'octopus.'

116
00:08:41,625 --> 00:08:44,875
Huh...?! Who doesn't like
octopus...? It's good!

117
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:46,416
What is wrong with you?

118
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:49,541
It's slimy and sticky and gross!

119
00:08:49,625 --> 00:08:51,833
Slimy and sticky, you bet!

120
00:08:51,916 --> 00:08:54,333
But not gross...
They make it wonderful!

121
00:08:56,416 --> 00:08:58,708
It's times like this that
make me wonder who hurt you.

122
00:08:58,791 --> 00:09:00,458
Calling all units!
Do you read me...!

123
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:02,375
This is Venenzian
First Squadron...!

124
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:04,958
We are currently locked
in combat with a Neuroi...!

125
00:09:05,041 --> 00:09:06,625
Requesting immediate
assistance...!

126
00:09:06,708 --> 00:09:08,041
Location, A-nine.

127
00:09:08,125 --> 00:09:10,166
Sounds like we're
gonna have to hurry!

128
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:12,458
Roger that!

129
00:09:14,041 --> 00:09:15,583
It's too dangerous, Major!

130
00:09:15,666 --> 00:09:17,000
You're gonna have to be patient

131
00:09:17,083 --> 00:09:19,708
and wait until the
Shiden-kai is repaired!

132
00:09:19,791 --> 00:09:21,666
Do you realize how many
people will be hurt...?

133
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:23,666
The Neuroi aren't
going to wait for us.

134
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:27,291
I suppose you could
say I've caught something

135
00:09:27,375 --> 00:09:29,375
from Sergeant Miyafuji.

136
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,541
The Venier has been
severely damaged...!

137
00:09:32,625 --> 00:09:34,583
Engine output falling rapidly!

138
00:09:34,666 --> 00:09:36,541
At this rate, it'll
be dead in the water!

139
00:09:36,625 --> 00:09:38,375
Is there nothing we can do?

140
00:09:39,083 --> 00:09:40,916
Commander...! There's a Witch!

141
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,125
You sure?

142
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:52,041
Who is that?!

143
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:53,875
A sun and moon emblem
with a white background...!

144
00:09:53,958 --> 00:09:55,750
She's from Fuso!

145
00:09:55,833 --> 00:09:56,875
A Fuso Witch?!

146
00:09:56,958 --> 00:09:58,500
Hey you guys!
Did you hear the news?!

147
00:09:58,583 --> 00:10:00,083
They've sent reinforcements!

148
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:01,625
What unit is she from?!

149
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,000
Wow!

150
00:10:09,083 --> 00:10:11,875
I need you to move as far away
as you can while I distract it!

151
00:10:11,958 --> 00:10:14,708
Negative...! We aren't going
to leave you here alone!

152
00:10:14,791 --> 00:10:16,666
With all due respect,
sir, we don't have

153
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:18,916
any means of fighting
back at this point!

154
00:10:22,458 --> 00:10:23,625
Yes, you're right...

155
00:10:23,708 --> 00:10:26,083
Unfortunately we would
only get in the way...

156
00:10:26,166 --> 00:10:29,750
I'm ordering all ships to bring
about a full speed retreat!

157
00:10:34,625 --> 00:10:36,000
Thank goodness.

158
00:10:40,291 --> 00:10:42,541
Please...!
Hurry and get out of here!

159
00:10:43,375 --> 00:10:45,000
Major Sakamoto!

160
00:10:45,333 --> 00:10:47,166
Ready...?! Attack straight on!

161
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:49,041
Roger!

162
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:03,666
Look out!

163
00:11:09,708 --> 00:11:11,041
Major!

164
00:11:13,625 --> 00:11:14,916
I've got this!

165
00:11:16,291 --> 00:11:18,250
Reppuzan!

166
00:11:34,458 --> 00:11:35,708
Sakamoto!

167
00:11:41,291 --> 00:11:42,708
Sorry for the wait...

168
00:11:42,791 --> 00:11:45,333
I would've arrived sooner,
but the Shiden-kai was damaged.

169
00:11:45,416 --> 00:11:47,166
You could've
really hurt yourself.

170
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:49,666
Maybe. But I didn't, did I...?

171
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:52,166
I wasn't lying when I said
I didn't need a shield to fight.

172
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:55,250
As long as I have my
Reppumaru, I'm fine!

173
00:11:55,333 --> 00:11:58,250
Wow... She's amazing.

174
00:11:58,333 --> 00:12:01,250
I forget sometimes
how wonderful she is!

175
00:12:02,458 --> 00:12:03,916
I'd like to know your opinion...

176
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,708
What do you think of "Reppumaru"
as a name for the sword...?

177
00:12:06,791 --> 00:12:09,291
I spent all night trying to
come up with something fitting.

178
00:12:09,375 --> 00:12:12,250
Oh... um... I don't know,
I guess it's pretty cool.

179
00:12:12,333 --> 00:12:15,125
You guess...?
Pretty cool...? Thanks!

180
00:12:18,375 --> 00:12:19,833
Shirley...! Look!

181
00:12:19,916 --> 00:12:22,291
Yep... Those are Neuroi
fragments, all right.

182
00:12:22,375 --> 00:12:26,791
Guess the Venezian fleet must've
beaten it, already...! Sweet!

183
00:12:29,208 --> 00:12:31,791
Be careful, I'm still picking
up a Neuroi presence here.

184
00:12:31,875 --> 00:12:35,250
Oh... You mean there
could still be more of them?

185
00:12:39,708 --> 00:12:41,041
Very impressive, Major...!

186
00:12:41,125 --> 00:12:43,291
Looks like you didn't need
the Shiden-kai after all!

187
00:12:45,125 --> 00:12:47,416
Thanks, it was easy... Too easy.

188
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,750
It probably only feels that way

189
00:12:49,833 --> 00:12:52,291
because you've gotten
so much stronger, lately.

190
00:12:52,375 --> 00:12:54,708
I hope you're right, Sergeant.

191
00:13:04,333 --> 00:13:06,291
Sakamoto, look over there!

192
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,333
Is the Neuroi regenerating now?!

193
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:31,083
It can't be.
The core's still alive!

194
00:13:31,166 --> 00:13:32,750
I'm on it!

195
00:13:32,833 --> 00:13:35,000
The core is in the tip of the
part that is regenerating...!

196
00:13:35,083 --> 00:13:37,333
Just blast it open
and finish it off!

197
00:13:37,416 --> 00:13:39,250
Right!

198
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:48,791
What...?! I see; so that's
its design...! Miyafuji...!

199
00:13:48,875 --> 00:13:50,750
Listen up! The core is moving!

200
00:13:50,833 --> 00:13:52,958
It's on the right tip now...!
Don't lose it!

201
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:54,333
I won't!

202
00:13:59,083 --> 00:14:00,666
Damn! It's dodging her shots...!

203
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:03,958
And it's regenerating
quickly... This is bad!

204
00:14:04,041 --> 00:14:05,791
Miyafuji...!

205
00:14:05,875 --> 00:14:08,291
The core keeps moving
just before your shots hit...!

206
00:14:08,375 --> 00:14:11,125
We're going to have to launch
multiple simultaneous attacks!

207
00:14:11,208 --> 00:14:12,291
What do you mean by that?

208
00:14:12,375 --> 00:14:14,291
You can't do it by yourself...!

209
00:14:14,375 --> 00:14:16,250
Just hold on!
I'm coming to help you!

210
00:14:16,791 --> 00:14:17,791
What's the status?!

211
00:14:17,875 --> 00:14:20,166
About five more
minutes should do it!

212
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:23,458
I just need it to fly...!
You have three minutes left!

213
00:14:26,958 --> 00:14:28,541
Major, be careful!

214
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,083
Hang on...! Her magic energy
is being pushed to its limit.

215
00:14:38,166 --> 00:14:40,708
I don't know how much
longer I can keep going...

216
00:14:40,791 --> 00:14:42,666
but I have to protect them!

217
00:14:50,125 --> 00:14:51,458
What is she doing?!

218
00:14:51,541 --> 00:14:53,041
You won't last...! Come back!

219
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:58,833
I found it!

220
00:15:03,625 --> 00:15:04,583
No!

221
00:15:04,666 --> 00:15:06,166
Sergeant, look...! Behind you!

222
00:15:11,625 --> 00:15:12,958
Miyafuji!

223
00:15:22,916 --> 00:15:28,000
Shield... have to put it up...
but can't move. Huh?

224
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:33,833
No way!

225
00:15:33,916 --> 00:15:35,375
Nice timing!

226
00:15:35,458 --> 00:15:36,833
Yahoo!

227
00:15:38,208 --> 00:15:39,916
Is that you, Shirley?!

228
00:15:42,333 --> 00:15:43,791
Yoshika, ciao!

229
00:15:43,875 --> 00:15:45,000
Hi, Francesca!

230
00:15:45,083 --> 00:15:46,208
Did you see that...?!

231
00:15:46,291 --> 00:15:48,833
Every single one of
my shots hit the Neuroi!

232
00:15:49,958 --> 00:15:50,916
What is with this thing?

233
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,541
This sucker's as hard as a rock.

234
00:15:52,625 --> 00:15:56,333
But wait... I don't understand,
what are you guys doing here?

235
00:15:56,416 --> 00:15:58,500
I think we could ask
you the same thing!

236
00:15:58,583 --> 00:16:00,375
We could if we
wanted to waste time!

237
00:16:01,541 --> 00:16:04,250
Huh...? That's so weird. I know
I hit it!

238
00:16:04,333 --> 00:16:06,541
You did, but it
regenerates fast!

239
00:16:06,625 --> 00:16:08,458
We don't have
the firepower for this!

240
00:16:13,083 --> 00:16:14,750
An anti-armor rifle...

241
00:16:14,833 --> 00:16:16,291
Then that means--!

242
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,458
It's Lyn!

243
00:16:18,541 --> 00:16:19,208
Lyn!

244
00:16:19,291 --> 00:16:21,791
Hi, Yoshika!

245
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,250
I'm so glad you're okay...!
And that you're here.

246
00:16:27,333 --> 00:16:30,458
Me too, I just
arrived from Gallia!

247
00:16:30,541 --> 00:16:33,583
That's great...! But we
really don't have time for this!

248
00:16:33,666 --> 00:16:34,750
Perrine!

249
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:41,583
Are those rockets?!

250
00:16:41,666 --> 00:16:44,625
Look!

251
00:16:44,708 --> 00:16:45,583
Eila!

252
00:16:45,666 --> 00:16:47,750
And Sanya!

253
00:16:47,833 --> 00:16:50,000
Awesome!

254
00:16:50,083 --> 00:16:51,708
I'm gonna move ahead.
You follow.

255
00:16:51,791 --> 00:16:53,125
Right.

256
00:17:01,041 --> 00:17:03,916
They're here...!
Are you done yet?!

257
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,291
Just one more minute!

258
00:17:05,375 --> 00:17:07,333
The Neuroi enemy
has a mobile core!

259
00:17:07,416 --> 00:17:10,875
Regeneration speed is more
than twice of a standard model!

260
00:17:10,958 --> 00:17:13,958
So we just have to destroy it
quicker than it can regenerate!

261
00:17:14,041 --> 00:17:15,750
Great... Just when
I finally managed

262
00:17:15,833 --> 00:17:18,041
to get some time off with Chris.

263
00:17:19,125 --> 00:17:22,000
But, weren't you the one
who wanted to fight the most?

264
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:23,625
I'm moving out!

265
00:17:24,125 --> 00:17:25,250
Wait! Hold on!

266
00:17:25,333 --> 00:17:26,666
It's them!

267
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:27,791
Look who's here!

268
00:17:27,875 --> 00:17:29,375
Commander Minna!

269
00:17:29,458 --> 00:17:30,750
Barkhorn!

270
00:17:30,833 --> 00:17:32,333
And Hartmann!

271
00:17:33,875 --> 00:17:34,708
Take the sides!

272
00:17:34,791 --> 00:17:36,041
Roger that!

273
00:17:36,708 --> 00:17:38,750
Commander Minna!
All-out assault!

274
00:17:38,833 --> 00:17:41,708
We're right on it...!
Formation...! Let's go!

275
00:17:41,791 --> 00:17:43,041
Roger that, Ma'am!

276
00:17:46,583 --> 00:17:48,375
Major...!
The Shiden-kai is ready!

277
00:17:48,458 --> 00:17:49,750
Perfect.

278
00:17:55,666 --> 00:17:57,166
Output seems to be normal!

279
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:59,583
I'm ready to go...! Now!

280
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:05,833
Commence attack!

281
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,250
The core is out!

282
00:19:01,541 --> 00:19:02,541
I've got this!

283
00:19:02,625 --> 00:19:03,958
But Sakamoto!

284
00:19:06,166 --> 00:19:06,708
Mio!

285
00:19:06,791 --> 00:19:08,166
I'm all right!

286
00:19:09,375 --> 00:19:10,583
What flight path is that?!

287
00:19:10,666 --> 00:19:12,083
She's dodging all the attacks!

288
00:19:12,166 --> 00:19:13,500
Just like you.

289
00:19:16,416 --> 00:19:17,458
Oh no! It's going to hit her!

290
00:19:17,541 --> 00:19:18,791
No, major!

291
00:19:18,875 --> 00:19:21,416
Slice it up... Reppumaru!

292
00:19:22,791 --> 00:19:24,041
Here it comes!

293
00:19:24,125 --> 00:19:27,208
Reppuzan!

294
00:19:34,541 --> 00:19:36,708
Whoa...! Did you just see that?

295
00:19:36,791 --> 00:19:38,791
Yeah!

296
00:19:38,875 --> 00:19:41,208
Perfect...! Just like always!

297
00:19:41,291 --> 00:19:42,416
Well this is new.

298
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:44,083
I've never seen anyone
slice a Neuroi beam.

299
00:19:44,166 --> 00:19:47,250
Maybe it's because no
one's ever tried it before?

300
00:19:53,375 --> 00:19:55,708
There's really
nothing we can't do!

301
00:20:00,708 --> 00:20:03,250
So those are the Strike
Witches I've heard about.

302
00:20:03,958 --> 00:20:05,291
Wait a minute, Commander.

303
00:20:05,375 --> 00:20:07,041
Is that the same squad
of witches that freed Gallia?

304
00:20:07,125 --> 00:20:10,666
Yes... The Five Hundred and
First Joint Fighter Wing...

305
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:13,125
And now these legendary
ladies have descended

306
00:20:13,208 --> 00:20:15,666
upon the Adriatic Sea!

307
00:20:26,041 --> 00:20:27,833
Yoshika!

308
00:20:27,916 --> 00:20:29,708
Oh, Lyn...! You're really here!

309
00:20:29,791 --> 00:20:33,041
Yeah! I'm so glad
you came for me!

310
00:20:36,041 --> 00:20:38,541
Y'know, I never thought
I'd see Yoshika here again.

311
00:20:38,625 --> 00:20:41,166
Um, weren't you two
supposed to be in Africa?

312
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:44,083
Uh, yeah, but that was before
we heard Romagna needed us!

313
00:20:44,166 --> 00:20:46,125
Oh... well, Sanya
and I were supposed

314
00:20:46,208 --> 00:20:47,583
to leave for Suomus today...

315
00:20:47,666 --> 00:20:49,416
But somehow we
took the wrong train

316
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:51,375
and ended up at
the Adriatic Sea!

317
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:53,625
Not really. Eila's
psychic skills told us

318
00:20:53,708 --> 00:20:55,166
there was trouble here.

319
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:57,416
That truly is an
incredible sword.

320
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:59,375
The Reppumaru...

321
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:01,833
I infused it with magic
each time I hammered it...

322
00:21:01,916 --> 00:21:04,875
It's instilled with
enchanted powers...

323
00:21:04,958 --> 00:21:08,875
The blade essentially becomes
stronger than any shield.

324
00:21:09,541 --> 00:21:12,625
Still, I worry about you
without an actual shield.

325
00:21:12,708 --> 00:21:18,166
I appreciate your concern...
but I just want to fly.

326
00:21:18,958 --> 00:21:22,541
I understand... You're not
going to step down, are you?

327
00:21:22,625 --> 00:21:23,958
No.

328
00:21:24,041 --> 00:21:26,000
I didn't think so.

329
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:31,583
Listen up...
These are our orders

330
00:21:31,666 --> 00:21:33,041
from the General Headquarters
of Allied Forces.

331
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:35,291
Once you are back on active
duty... you are to return

332
00:21:35,375 --> 00:21:37,375
to the Adriatic Sea
in order to intercept

333
00:21:37,458 --> 00:21:40,583
and destroy the new Neuroi
that has invaded Romagna...

334
00:21:40,666 --> 00:21:43,125
We will be sure to send you
all the necessary equipment

335
00:21:43,208 --> 00:21:45,541
and materials to
complete this task...

336
00:21:45,625 --> 00:21:48,250
Until then, do not
hesitate to contact the

337
00:21:48,333 --> 00:21:51,666
local commanding officers
for anything you may require.

338
00:21:53,875 --> 00:21:55,833
Well they sure are
playing their cards right.

339
00:21:55,916 --> 00:21:58,541
Major General Galland
signed this herself.

340
00:21:58,625 --> 00:22:01,041
Or at least was
forced to, anyway.

341
00:22:01,125 --> 00:22:03,916
You're being very
disrespectful, Hartmann...

342
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,750
Orders are orders--regardless
of how they are given.

343
00:22:06,833 --> 00:22:08,583
Yeah, sure.

344
00:22:09,416 --> 00:22:12,333
Hey, Lyn... What do you think it
means that we all met up again?

345
00:22:12,416 --> 00:22:14,458
Um, well...

346
00:22:15,666 --> 00:22:18,625
I, Lieutenant Colonel
Minna Wilcke, with...

347
00:22:18,708 --> 00:22:21,083
Major Mio Sakamoto

348
00:22:21,166 --> 00:22:23,333
Captain Gertrud Barkhorn...

349
00:22:23,416 --> 00:22:25,916
Captain Charlotte Yeager...

350
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,458
Lieutenant Erica Hartmann...

351
00:22:28,541 --> 00:22:31,458
Lieutenant Sanya Litvyak...

352
00:22:31,541 --> 00:22:33,833
Lieutenant Perrine
Clostermann...

353
00:22:33,916 --> 00:22:36,958
Ensign Eila Ilmatar
Juutilainen...

354
00:22:37,041 --> 00:22:39,375
Ensign Francesca Lucchini

355
00:22:39,458 --> 00:22:41,958
Master Sergeant
Lynette Bishop...

356
00:22:42,041 --> 00:22:44,666
And Sergeant Yoshika Miyafuji...

357
00:22:48,958 --> 00:22:51,291
Together... we are
the Strike Witches...

358
00:22:51,375 --> 00:22:53,833
and the Five Hundred
and First Joint Fighter Wing

359
00:22:53,916 --> 00:22:55,250
is hereby reformed!

360
00:22:55,333 --> 00:22:56,291
Roger!

361
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:30,666
Can you believe it, Yoshika?!

362
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:33,541
We get to be
together again...! Huh?

363
00:24:33,625 --> 00:24:36,375
Training? Now...? Yoshika, wait!

364
00:24:36,458 --> 00:24:39,500
Don't leave me...!
On the next Strike Witches 2:

365
00:24:39,583 --> 00:24:41,083
"That Which We Can Do."
