1
00:03:18,791 --> 00:03:20,625
Seriously, again?

2
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,666
Ta-da!

3
00:03:44,083 --> 00:03:45,791
This is the way
we pick the bugs,

4
00:03:45,875 --> 00:03:47,875
pick the bugs, pick the bugs...

5
00:03:47,958 --> 00:03:50,291
This is the way we pick the bu--

6
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:56,875
This little bug is so cool!

7
00:04:01,333 --> 00:04:03,083
It's time already?

8
00:04:07,541 --> 00:04:09,625
And it's another
beautiful morning, isn't it?

9
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,416
Let's start with good news...

10
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:14,666
The facility crew has
been working double shifts

11
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:17,166
and reports they have
finally finished the bath...

12
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:20,000
All of you are welcome to use
it starting this afternoon.

13
00:04:21,458 --> 00:04:22,625
Hooray!

14
00:04:22,708 --> 00:04:24,583
It's bath time! Naked time!

15
00:04:24,666 --> 00:04:26,541
I had them build
the bath outside...

16
00:04:26,625 --> 00:04:28,791
So you can look out
onto the Adriatic.

17
00:04:28,875 --> 00:04:30,791
Oh. That sounds nice.

18
00:04:30,875 --> 00:04:34,375
Yes... I know Sanya's
just going to love it.

19
00:04:34,458 --> 00:04:36,958
You're all officially off duty
for the rest of the day...

20
00:04:37,041 --> 00:04:38,208
and don't keep the bath a secret

21
00:04:38,291 --> 00:04:40,333
because we want
everyone to join in.

22
00:04:40,416 --> 00:04:41,666
Yes, ma'am.

23
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:43,500
I know what I'm doing today.

24
00:04:43,916 --> 00:04:47,125
Let's go in together...
You too, Perrine.

25
00:04:47,208 --> 00:04:48,500
Well... why not?.

26
00:04:48,583 --> 00:04:49,791
Steam baths have
been recommended

27
00:04:49,875 --> 00:04:51,833
for their healing
properties for centuries.

28
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:55,875
Bath time! Bath time!
Last one in is a rotten egg!

29
00:04:56,791 --> 00:04:58,000
Don't you ever listen?

30
00:04:58,083 --> 00:05:01,125
It isn't open until
this afternoon.

31
00:05:02,333 --> 00:05:04,208
I want a bath now.

32
00:05:04,291 --> 00:05:06,833
There's lots of time to kill
before you can all soap up...

33
00:05:06,916 --> 00:05:08,458
I know of one sure
way we can spend it

34
00:05:08,541 --> 00:05:10,458
to make the new
facility more enjoyable.

35
00:05:10,541 --> 00:05:13,375
Yes...! What is it,
Major Sakamoto?

36
00:05:14,375 --> 00:05:15,666
With sweaty exercise...

37
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:18,458
You will all run twenty-five
laps around the base.

38
00:05:19,791 --> 00:05:21,666
But I thought you said
we were off-duty today?

39
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:24,208
Should I make it fifty...?
Get running!

40
00:05:24,291 --> 00:05:25,666
Yes, ma'am.

41
00:05:28,333 --> 00:05:29,500
I don't get it...

42
00:05:29,583 --> 00:05:32,208
Why are they so excited
about soaking in bath?

43
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:33,958
I think they're more excited

44
00:05:34,041 --> 00:05:36,541
about getting some
time off to relax.

45
00:05:37,291 --> 00:05:38,666
You look exhausted.

46
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:41,708
Lately, it seems I'm not
sure who the real enemy is...

47
00:05:41,791 --> 00:05:43,583
the brass up in HQ
that keeps me grounded,

48
00:05:43,666 --> 00:05:45,208
or the Neuroi attacking us...

49
00:05:45,291 --> 00:05:48,083
You haven't seen a lot of action
lately, that's for sure...

50
00:05:48,166 --> 00:05:50,666
I can't remember, what's
your Neuroi kill streak?

51
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:53,916
It's been stuck at 199
for a long time now...

52
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,083
In fact if I get one more

53
00:05:55,166 --> 00:05:56,958
I think they have
to give me a medal...

54
00:05:57,041 --> 00:05:58,291
All I really want, though,

55
00:05:58,375 --> 00:06:00,875
is to get out from
behind my stupid desk.

56
00:06:00,958 --> 00:06:02,291
I bet a nice soak would help you

57
00:06:02,375 --> 00:06:04,208
forget all about that paperwork.

58
00:06:04,291 --> 00:06:06,333
You should take a break later.

59
00:06:06,916 --> 00:06:10,083
I have a huge stack of base
status reports to catch up on...

60
00:06:10,166 --> 00:06:13,041
But I will think about
it... if that's okay.

61
00:06:13,125 --> 00:06:16,291
Of course...
Don't work too hard.

62
00:06:21,041 --> 00:06:22,375
A bug? What kind?

63
00:06:22,458 --> 00:06:24,833
I don't know...
but it was super shiny

64
00:06:24,916 --> 00:06:26,750
and only as big as a pimple ...

65
00:06:26,833 --> 00:06:28,875
I'll show it to you when
we're finished running.

66
00:06:28,958 --> 00:06:31,791
Yeah... great...
I love bug stuff.

67
00:07:01,333 --> 00:07:02,958
A blackout. Perfect.

68
00:07:22,666 --> 00:07:23,791
You know I have
a strict prohibition

69
00:07:23,875 --> 00:07:26,708
against your stuff
on my Siegfried Line.

70
00:07:28,208 --> 00:07:30,666
Get up, Hartmann!
It's the middle of the day.

71
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:33,833
Just two more hours...

72
00:07:35,333 --> 00:07:38,083
Not again. 'Two more
hours' in your dreams.

73
00:07:43,708 --> 00:07:45,750
I can't even put my
foot down... Oh no...

74
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:51,375
That does it...
Get up, Hartmann.

75
00:07:51,458 --> 00:07:53,583
Get up and do something.

76
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:57,666
Two more minutes, okay...?

77
00:07:58,625 --> 00:08:00,583
Get up right now.

78
00:08:03,666 --> 00:08:04,875
What was that?

79
00:08:10,583 --> 00:08:13,875
You crossed my
Siegfried Line, Hartmann...

80
00:08:14,416 --> 00:08:18,583
That's it. I can't
take it anymore. Get up!

81
00:08:23,666 --> 00:08:25,583
Right. It's time. Go ahead.

82
00:08:25,666 --> 00:08:27,083
Yeah!

83
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:30,500
She's so excited!

84
00:08:30,583 --> 00:08:31,750
Bath. Bath.

85
00:08:31,833 --> 00:08:33,166
What's the matter, Perrine?

86
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:34,333
You're not going in?

87
00:08:34,416 --> 00:08:37,291
Oh... not yet... how about you?

88
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:39,250
No... I already
took a bath outside

89
00:08:39,333 --> 00:08:42,333
after training today...
in the old washtub.

90
00:08:43,375 --> 00:08:45,791
Good... that was prudent.

91
00:08:53,458 --> 00:08:54,750
Wow.

92
00:08:54,833 --> 00:08:56,541
It's amazing.

93
00:08:58,625 --> 00:09:00,500
Cannon ball!

94
00:09:00,583 --> 00:09:02,125
What she said!

95
00:09:04,291 --> 00:09:05,708
Oh yeah!

96
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:07,708
This water's so nice.

97
00:09:07,791 --> 00:09:10,541
Come on. Jump in already.

98
00:09:17,041 --> 00:09:19,083
What is it you're
trying to hide there?

99
00:09:24,458 --> 00:09:25,791
Give that back right now.

100
00:09:25,875 --> 00:09:27,166
Wow... No way...

101
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:29,750
It looks like they're
even bigger than before.

102
00:09:31,666 --> 00:09:33,291
Let's find out, eh?

103
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:35,041
Boingy, boingy, boingy...

104
00:09:35,125 --> 00:09:37,583
Stop it, Eila. They're
not your personal funbags.

105
00:09:37,666 --> 00:09:39,250
How 'bout we check out yours?

106
00:09:42,208 --> 00:09:43,583
Nothing there.

107
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:45,208
Nothing?

108
00:09:45,291 --> 00:09:46,791
I'm not all that bad!

109
00:09:46,875 --> 00:09:48,416
Raisins...

110
00:09:49,541 --> 00:09:51,458
They have no class.

111
00:09:59,791 --> 00:10:01,666
That felt so good.

112
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:04,166
I'm getting Shirley
to go with me next time.

113
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:07,333
I hope Sanya wakes up
and comes here soon.

114
00:10:07,416 --> 00:10:08,916
I swear...
You're all acting as if

115
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,041
we're in the last days
of the Holy Roman Empire.

116
00:10:36,791 --> 00:10:40,708
Hey...! What's wrong, Lynne?.

117
00:10:40,791 --> 00:10:43,791
Um, I think something's
crawling in my panties...

118
00:10:43,875 --> 00:10:45,000
Oh no!

119
00:10:46,125 --> 00:10:47,916
What is that? A bug?

120
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,416
Bug?! But... no.

121
00:10:56,583 --> 00:10:57,875
What's wrong?

122
00:10:57,958 --> 00:10:59,708
Great... That'll
give me nightmares.

123
00:10:59,791 --> 00:11:03,375
Why...? What's the big deal?
It's just a little insect.

124
00:11:05,041 --> 00:11:07,625
Hey, what is it?

125
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:10,625
There's something
crawling... on my butt!

126
00:11:10,708 --> 00:11:11,416
Oh no.

127
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:12,958
It must be the bug.

128
00:11:13,041 --> 00:11:13,458
Yay!

129
00:11:13,541 --> 00:11:14,791
Hold still.

130
00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:17,625
No... Stop... Stay back.

131
00:11:21,708 --> 00:11:24,000
Wow... that's disgusting.

132
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:25,750
My bug!

133
00:11:25,833 --> 00:11:27,541
I swear... I guess I should
expect nothing less

134
00:11:27,625 --> 00:11:29,000
from all of you...

135
00:11:29,083 --> 00:11:30,791
If you choose to live your
lives like filthy barbarians

136
00:11:30,875 --> 00:11:33,375
you're bound to get bugs
crawling in your underwear.

137
00:11:39,208 --> 00:11:40,416
It's got Perrine now!

138
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:41,583
Don't squish it.

139
00:11:41,666 --> 00:11:43,833
I don't know what you mean.

140
00:11:43,916 --> 00:11:45,791
There's nothing
on my butt at all...

141
00:11:47,625 --> 00:11:49,375
No, not in there...

142
00:11:51,208 --> 00:11:52,000
Drop 'em.

143
00:11:52,083 --> 00:11:53,458
You have to take your pants off.

144
00:11:53,541 --> 00:11:56,083
There's nothing
wrong. I'm fine...

145
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,416
I told Perrine
I wasn't coming...

146
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:03,208
but it's been a while since
I soaked in a regular bath.

147
00:12:03,708 --> 00:12:05,416
Francesca, don't you dare.

148
00:12:06,375 --> 00:12:07,041
I don't see the bug.

149
00:12:07,125 --> 00:12:08,500
Uh... Ladies.

150
00:12:08,583 --> 00:12:10,333
Hi.

151
00:12:10,416 --> 00:12:11,791
Major Sakamoto.

152
00:12:11,875 --> 00:12:13,666
Please kill me.

153
00:12:14,833 --> 00:12:16,291
It's out.

154
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:28,625
A power outage?

155
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,166
Embarrassing...

156
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:48,416
All of this commotion
because of a little bug?

157
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:51,083
It was more than a bunch of
girls freaking out over a bug.

158
00:12:51,166 --> 00:12:53,208
It tried to... to gain entry.

159
00:12:53,291 --> 00:12:54,791
That's correct.

160
00:12:54,875 --> 00:12:57,291
That rude little creature tried
to violate my sacred nethers...

161
00:12:57,375 --> 00:12:59,625
It's absolutely unforgivable.

162
00:12:59,708 --> 00:13:01,083
You know that
bug's my friend, right?

163
00:13:01,166 --> 00:13:03,166
Stop... Let's just
catch the thing.

164
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:05,375
But... ew...

165
00:13:17,958 --> 00:13:19,625
A total waste of my time.

166
00:13:19,708 --> 00:13:21,500
There it is!

167
00:13:21,583 --> 00:13:22,250
Sounds like fun.

168
00:13:22,333 --> 00:13:23,166
It went this way.

169
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:24,166
Buggy!

170
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:25,708
You're running too fast...

171
00:13:25,791 --> 00:13:26,916
Where is that fiend?

172
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,791
Are you positive
it went this way?

173
00:13:29,458 --> 00:13:31,083
What's with all this noise?

174
00:13:31,166 --> 00:13:32,833
Lieutenant Barkhorn...

175
00:13:32,916 --> 00:13:36,291
That's enough... Regulations
in the barracks are very strict.

176
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:37,458
Look.

177
00:13:37,541 --> 00:13:38,333
Buggy.

178
00:13:38,416 --> 00:13:40,083
Buggy? Who cares about a bug...

179
00:13:40,166 --> 00:13:42,541
I want to know who was
responsible for start--

180
00:13:43,458 --> 00:13:45,500
Yup... looks like
the bug found her butt.

181
00:13:45,583 --> 00:13:46,708
Um, are you okay?

182
00:13:46,791 --> 00:13:48,416
Silence.

183
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:49,916
In battle, soldiers always need

184
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,541
to maintain discipline
and reason...

185
00:13:52,625 --> 00:13:56,500
you weigh the options...
then... you act!

186
00:13:58,875 --> 00:14:01,125
Sneak attack!

187
00:14:01,208 --> 00:14:02,541
Ow, my ass!

188
00:14:03,916 --> 00:14:04,708
I missed...

189
00:14:04,791 --> 00:14:06,375
Thanks... That's enough.

190
00:14:07,583 --> 00:14:08,375
There it goes.

191
00:14:08,458 --> 00:14:09,916
Not without us.

192
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:10,500
Stop right there.

193
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:11,250
Come back.

194
00:14:11,333 --> 00:14:12,583
My bug!

195
00:14:14,916 --> 00:14:17,166
Well... so much for rules.

196
00:14:25,333 --> 00:14:26,583
That's that...

197
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:28,541
I'm finally caught up on
all of my paperwork again.

198
00:14:28,625 --> 00:14:29,833
Oh... yeah...

199
00:14:29,916 --> 00:14:31,500
There's still
plenty of daylight left.

200
00:14:31,583 --> 00:14:35,125
Maybe I'll go soak in the
new baths and just relax.

201
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:38,583
You're saying it's
no ordinary insect?

202
00:14:38,666 --> 00:14:41,083
It sure seemed like
a normal bug at first...

203
00:14:41,166 --> 00:14:43,125
There's been a power
outage everywhere it's been

204
00:14:43,208 --> 00:14:44,875
and that's no coincidence.

205
00:14:44,958 --> 00:14:46,083
We must destroy it.

206
00:14:46,166 --> 00:14:48,250
You're not touching my bug.

207
00:14:48,708 --> 00:14:49,416
Major.

208
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:50,750
If we don't do something,

209
00:14:50,833 --> 00:14:52,500
it could completely
neutralize the entire base.

210
00:14:52,583 --> 00:14:53,750
I agree...

211
00:14:53,833 --> 00:14:55,666
but the real question
is how do we find it...

212
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:57,333
But that bug is my friend.

213
00:14:57,416 --> 00:14:58,666
Leave it to me.

214
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:00,125
It's Shirley.

215
00:15:00,208 --> 00:15:01,250
Yay.

216
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:03,500
I heard everything.

217
00:15:03,583 --> 00:15:05,666
I tapped into the
electrical flow regulators

218
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:07,041
in base operations,

219
00:15:07,125 --> 00:15:09,916
and it appears that just
before it causes a blackout,

220
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,875
this bug emits a
short subsonic radio wave

221
00:15:11,958 --> 00:15:14,041
and sucks out all the
energy from the wires.

222
00:15:14,125 --> 00:15:16,458
Does that mean we all have
electricity in our butts?

223
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:18,583
No, Yoshika.

224
00:15:18,666 --> 00:15:21,166
Well that's a shame.

225
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:22,625
We don't need
clothes to fight...

226
00:15:22,708 --> 00:15:25,041
We're half naked
all the time anyway.

227
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:26,250
No, thank you.

228
00:15:26,333 --> 00:15:28,208
I'm not giving up
my uniform for a bug...

229
00:15:28,291 --> 00:15:29,375
and from the looks of it,

230
00:15:29,458 --> 00:15:30,875
Shirley's already
got a plan for us.

231
00:15:30,958 --> 00:15:31,750
Yes, ma'am...

232
00:15:31,833 --> 00:15:34,208
This is my handheld radar...

233
00:15:34,291 --> 00:15:36,708
I adjusted it to search
for our little invader...

234
00:15:36,791 --> 00:15:38,416
It picks up his
specific frequency

235
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:40,750
so we can hone right
in on his location...

236
00:15:40,833 --> 00:15:42,916
I call it the "Bugdar".

237
00:15:46,625 --> 00:15:48,416
Bingo. It's here.

238
00:15:49,041 --> 00:15:51,500
The signal's strong...
It's close.

239
00:15:57,208 --> 00:15:58,916
Hey, it's not on me. NO!

240
00:16:00,833 --> 00:16:02,083
There.

241
00:16:07,041 --> 00:16:07,958
Yup, that's him.

242
00:16:08,041 --> 00:16:09,500
It's my little buggy!

243
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,333
Stop running!

244
00:16:12,875 --> 00:16:15,333
This is not very fun.

245
00:16:15,666 --> 00:16:16,833
Miyafuji. Drop 'em.

246
00:16:16,916 --> 00:16:18,625
You'll have to catch me first.

247
00:16:18,708 --> 00:16:19,666
Stripping's the only.

248
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:29,708
I'll find another way.

249
00:16:29,791 --> 00:16:39,291
I'll find another way.

250
00:16:39,375 --> 00:16:41,000
Oh crap! It got the "Bugdar."

251
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:41,791
There it is!

252
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:42,875
We can't let it get away!

253
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:44,458
Right. Let's go!

254
00:16:45,666 --> 00:16:48,000
I'm coming to save you, Mr. Bug!

255
00:16:50,416 --> 00:16:52,250
Wait... I know what to do.

256
00:16:55,583 --> 00:16:56,708
It's dark in here...

257
00:16:56,791 --> 00:16:59,083
I guess the
maintenance crew decided

258
00:16:59,166 --> 00:17:01,333
to open it before they
had everything completed.

259
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:10,875
Great... I don't
need electricity

260
00:17:10,958 --> 00:17:12,333
to find it with these.

261
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:15,083
Oh. It's working.

262
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,041
Yes.

263
00:17:20,666 --> 00:17:22,250
Its... on Sanya...

264
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:25,916
No... it looks like
it's somewhere behind her.

265
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,875
At least I hope.

266
00:17:29,625 --> 00:17:31,291
If it's in her panties...

267
00:17:31,375 --> 00:17:33,583
I have to check, right?

268
00:17:33,666 --> 00:17:37,291
I'm only doing this
for her own good.

269
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:47,291
Here goes.

270
00:17:56,291 --> 00:17:58,125
Wait... It's not what you think.

271
00:18:00,458 --> 00:18:01,833
Eila...

272
00:18:15,875 --> 00:18:17,333
So she hit me.

273
00:18:17,416 --> 00:18:19,875
But Sanya is sensing a Neuroi
presence somewhere close by.

274
00:18:19,958 --> 00:18:22,041
I haven't pinpointed them yet...

275
00:18:22,125 --> 00:18:23,958
but one is above the base...

276
00:18:24,041 --> 00:18:25,958
and the other is here
inside the building.

277
00:18:26,041 --> 00:18:27,208
Inside the building?

278
00:18:27,291 --> 00:18:29,083
Don't tell me that
bug's the Neuroi.

279
00:18:30,833 --> 00:18:33,666
Eila. Sanya, that bug
is our first priority...

280
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:34,916
Help us search the building.

281
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,541
Understood.

282
00:18:36,625 --> 00:18:37,666
Barkhorn and Hartmann...

283
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:39,583
suit up for an aerial intercept.

284
00:18:39,666 --> 00:18:40,625
Understood.

285
00:18:40,708 --> 00:18:43,125
Miyafuji, you're with me.

286
00:18:43,208 --> 00:18:44,166
Yes, ma'am.

287
00:18:57,458 --> 00:18:59,125
Neuroi confirmed.

288
00:18:59,208 --> 00:19:01,791
Major Sakamoto, Commander
Minna isn't in her room.

289
00:19:01,875 --> 00:19:05,250
What...? We've no choice...
I'll sound the alarm.

290
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:12,375
Damn... It's taken out the
base's electrical system.

291
00:19:12,458 --> 00:19:15,375
Miyafuji Notify Barkhorn
and Hartmann in the hangar.

292
00:19:15,458 --> 00:19:16,333
On the double.

293
00:19:16,416 --> 00:19:18,583
Right.

294
00:19:30,541 --> 00:19:31,083
This way.

295
00:19:31,166 --> 00:19:32,416
Okay.

296
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:37,500
If I were a bug...

297
00:19:37,583 --> 00:19:39,750
This is exactly the kind of
place where I would hang out.

298
00:19:39,833 --> 00:19:42,166
It's going to pay once
I get my hands on it.

299
00:19:43,458 --> 00:19:45,125
Do you have a visitor?

300
00:19:45,208 --> 00:19:47,750
No... I just have
a little chaffing...

301
00:19:47,833 --> 00:19:48,833
Here it is.

302
00:19:48,916 --> 00:19:51,250
The bug's somewhere on Perrine.

303
00:19:51,333 --> 00:19:54,291
Don't you think I'd know if that
disgusting creature came back?

304
00:19:54,375 --> 00:19:55,625
We should still check.

305
00:19:55,708 --> 00:19:57,291
I told you, it's not here.

306
00:19:57,375 --> 00:19:59,166
Then take them off.

307
00:20:00,291 --> 00:20:03,375
Fine! I guess I have no choice.

308
00:20:03,458 --> 00:20:04,375
Target acquired.

309
00:20:04,458 --> 00:20:06,166
Roger. All set here.

310
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:09,416
Full moon!

311
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:16,791
Firing.

312
00:20:16,875 --> 00:20:18,000
A direct hit.

313
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:19,041
Is it down?

314
00:20:19,125 --> 00:20:20,875
Not quite.

315
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:23,666
It's on the move.

316
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:25,208
We have to catch it.

317
00:20:25,291 --> 00:20:26,625
Right behind you.

318
00:20:26,708 --> 00:20:27,958
Come back here little buggy!

319
00:20:28,041 --> 00:20:29,041
Stop!

320
00:20:29,125 --> 00:20:31,291
Hey...! Wait for me.

321
00:20:31,375 --> 00:20:33,041
Are you okay?

322
00:20:33,791 --> 00:20:35,916
I have a message
from Major Sakamoto.

323
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,708
She can't locate the core of
the Neuroi above the base...

324
00:20:38,791 --> 00:20:40,625
but we can't wait
for her to find it...

325
00:20:40,708 --> 00:20:43,625
She wants you two to intercept
it as soon as possible.

326
00:20:43,708 --> 00:20:45,166
Understood.

327
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:46,666
Also, the flying
thing knocking out

328
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:49,625
the base's electrical systems
hasn't been neutralized...

329
00:20:49,708 --> 00:20:52,041
That makes this
mission extra dangerous

330
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:55,250
That bug with that panty
fetish thing is so weird.

331
00:20:55,333 --> 00:20:58,416
We were just discussing how
we were going to deal with it.

332
00:21:03,083 --> 00:21:04,541
Let's go, Hartmann.

333
00:21:04,625 --> 00:21:06,041
It's a little breezy!

334
00:21:10,875 --> 00:21:11,833
This way.

335
00:21:13,083 --> 00:21:14,333
Major... Major...

336
00:21:14,416 --> 00:21:16,666
Barkhorn and Hartmann
are successfully underway.

337
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:18,625
Good.

338
00:21:20,708 --> 00:21:21,916
Come on!

339
00:21:37,416 --> 00:21:39,791
Mio was certainly right.

340
00:21:39,875 --> 00:21:42,166
I feel completely relaxed.

341
00:21:44,541 --> 00:21:45,208
Over there.

342
00:21:45,291 --> 00:21:45,958
I concur.

343
00:21:46,041 --> 00:21:47,208
Don't move.

344
00:21:47,291 --> 00:21:49,208
Uh... what's wrong?

345
00:21:49,291 --> 00:21:50,750
Commence attack!

346
00:21:52,833 --> 00:21:53,875
I see it.

347
00:22:07,833 --> 00:22:08,375
Wow...

348
00:22:08,458 --> 00:22:10,083
Well done, Minna.

349
00:22:10,166 --> 00:22:10,958
No way!

350
00:22:11,041 --> 00:22:12,250
Oh...! That was just great.

351
00:22:12,333 --> 00:22:15,833
My bug went squish.

352
00:22:15,916 --> 00:22:18,166
Wait... what are
you talking about?

353
00:22:24,708 --> 00:22:25,708
There she goes.

354
00:22:25,791 --> 00:22:28,500
But we didn't even
do anything to it.

355
00:22:29,541 --> 00:22:32,458
Sakamoto here. The core
has been neutralized.

356
00:22:32,541 --> 00:22:34,583
The airborne unit must
have been the secondary.

357
00:22:34,666 --> 00:22:36,333
Return to base at once.

358
00:22:36,416 --> 00:22:37,416
Wow...

359
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:39,833
Understood...
Terminating mission now.

360
00:22:45,833 --> 00:22:47,041
Not long after that,

361
00:22:47,125 --> 00:22:49,375
even though it was
unconventional warfare,

362
00:22:49,458 --> 00:22:52,041
Lieutenant Colonel Minna
Dietlinde Wilcke was awarded

363
00:22:52,125 --> 00:22:54,333
a medal for her 200th kill.

364
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:57,416
To be
continued...

365
00:24:29,916 --> 00:24:31,916
Oh, no... What's
happened to me...?

366
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,916
I won't be able to
protect anyone like this...

367
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,958
Wait... Wait, everyone!

368
00:24:37,041 --> 00:24:40,875
On the next Strike Witches 2:
"Please Give Me Wings."
