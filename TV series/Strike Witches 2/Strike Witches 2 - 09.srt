1
00:00:27,791 --> 00:00:29,541
Not much longer until
this elementary school

2
00:00:29,625 --> 00:00:32,166
is finally finished...
All right!

3
00:00:33,208 --> 00:00:35,875
Just look at it... The village
has come a long way.

4
00:00:35,958 --> 00:00:39,833
It's unbelievable...
and wonderful.

5
00:00:44,958 --> 00:00:46,708
Perrine, I have a question.

6
00:00:46,791 --> 00:00:48,416
Sure, what is it, honey?

7
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:51,500
It's just my friends can't
come to school with me anymore.

8
00:00:51,583 --> 00:00:53,500
Really? And why not?

9
00:00:53,583 --> 00:00:54,791
Come and see!

10
00:01:02,166 --> 00:01:03,208
That's why.

11
00:01:09,541 --> 00:01:11,166
The bridge...

12
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:16,666
Yeah... my friends can't come
over here because it got broken.

13
00:03:01,583 --> 00:03:02,708
Heads up, girls!

14
00:03:02,791 --> 00:03:04,875
Everyone! Prepare for battle!

15
00:03:04,958 --> 00:03:06,041
Yes, ma'am!

16
00:03:13,291 --> 00:03:15,083
She's climbing so quickly!

17
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:29,666
Don't get too far ahead of us!

18
00:03:33,833 --> 00:03:35,041
My turn!

19
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
The bridge!

20
00:03:43,083 --> 00:03:44,250
Don't worry about it.

21
00:03:44,333 --> 00:03:46,291
The damage is minimal...!
Stay in formation!

22
00:03:48,375 --> 00:03:49,375
Get back here!

23
00:03:49,458 --> 00:03:51,208
For that little trick,
you'll pay...!

24
00:03:55,166 --> 00:03:56,791
Wow... She's mad!

25
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:59,708
Now's our chance!
All units, attack!

26
00:03:59,791 --> 00:04:00,916
Yes, ma'am!

27
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,416
I can see the core.

28
00:04:18,416 --> 00:04:20,875
What kinda stupid jerk
hurts an innocent bridge?!

29
00:04:28,666 --> 00:04:29,416
You did it!

30
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:30,625
Way to go!

31
00:04:40,166 --> 00:04:42,125
Congrats... Wonderful work.

32
00:04:42,208 --> 00:04:43,875
You all performed well.

33
00:04:44,416 --> 00:04:45,416
I think you're
getting accustomed

34
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,000
to the Shinden, Miyafuji.

35
00:04:47,083 --> 00:04:49,916
Thanks...! But I still need
to train a whole lot more

36
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,333
if I plan on mastering it.

37
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:53,166
That's a great attitude!

38
00:04:54,041 --> 00:04:55,041
Perrine!

39
00:04:56,166 --> 00:04:57,291
Perrine!

40
00:04:57,375 --> 00:04:59,750
What...?! Oh... yes, ma'am?

41
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:01,916
You fought
especially well today.

42
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,916
Oh... Yes, thank you very much.

43
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,125
Well that was weird.

44
00:05:08,208 --> 00:05:09,541
Way weird.

45
00:05:09,625 --> 00:05:10,791
Whaddaya mean?

46
00:05:10,875 --> 00:05:12,625
Well come on, anytime
the Major praises her,

47
00:05:12,708 --> 00:05:14,500
Perrine gets all like...

48
00:05:14,833 --> 00:05:19,125
"Oh, Major...! I am
great... That's so true!"

49
00:05:19,208 --> 00:05:22,916
"And please... keep
telling me how awesome I am!"

50
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:23,791
It's true.

51
00:05:23,875 --> 00:05:25,708
Yeah... I guess you're right.

52
00:05:32,583 --> 00:05:34,041
We had so many heirlooms...

53
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:37,666
I can't believe this is all
that's left of the Clostermanns.

54
00:05:38,541 --> 00:05:41,208
The rapier... it's all I have...

55
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:42,916
But if I sold it...

56
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:45,708
I might be able to
get enough money

57
00:05:45,791 --> 00:05:48,041
to rebuild the
bridge for those kids.

58
00:05:55,125 --> 00:05:58,875
Mother... Father...
I don't know what I should do.

59
00:06:02,791 --> 00:06:04,708
It's me, hello!

60
00:06:05,666 --> 00:06:07,125
You scared me!

61
00:06:08,458 --> 00:06:09,625
I'm sorry!

62
00:06:10,583 --> 00:06:11,791
Are you okay?

63
00:06:11,875 --> 00:06:13,250
Why are you in here...?!

64
00:06:13,333 --> 00:06:15,666
You know you're supposed
to knock first, don't you?

65
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:18,250
Yes, but... the beach.

66
00:06:18,333 --> 00:06:21,083
We're going to the beach
tomorrow, isn't that great!

67
00:06:21,166 --> 00:06:22,958
Oh... yeah.

68
00:06:26,708 --> 00:06:28,291
Yahoo!

69
00:06:28,375 --> 00:06:30,625
Yay...! Hurry up, you guys!

70
00:06:30,708 --> 00:06:32,041
Let's go, already!

71
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:33,833
Hold on...! Wait!

72
00:06:33,916 --> 00:06:36,041
We have to do our
warm up exercises!

73
00:06:39,875 --> 00:06:40,708
Splish splash!

74
00:06:40,791 --> 00:06:42,541
Great! Now you made me get wet.

75
00:06:43,916 --> 00:06:44,666
Listen up!

76
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:45,875
You must not hold back just

77
00:06:45,958 --> 00:06:47,458
because it's a
training exercise!

78
00:06:47,541 --> 00:06:51,250
But be careful...
It has been a while.

79
00:06:51,333 --> 00:06:53,625
I hate this kind of training!

80
00:06:53,708 --> 00:06:55,625
I don't even know what it's for.

81
00:06:55,708 --> 00:06:57,500
Yes... Complete waste of time.

82
00:06:57,583 --> 00:06:59,666
Hurry up and dive in!

83
00:07:08,166 --> 00:07:09,750
This is such lovely weather.

84
00:07:09,833 --> 00:07:11,833
Yeah, it is nice.

85
00:07:15,583 --> 00:07:17,083
Oh! Impressive,
Perrine...! Good.

86
00:07:17,166 --> 00:07:19,625
Thank you! I owe
it to your guidance.

87
00:07:19,958 --> 00:07:22,083
Yes. You. Ma... jor...

88
00:07:23,333 --> 00:07:24,125
Air!

89
00:07:24,208 --> 00:07:25,875
Stop! You're going to drown me!

90
00:07:25,958 --> 00:07:26,916
I almost died!

91
00:07:34,625 --> 00:07:36,458
Exercise... complete!

92
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:39,833
I'm hungry...

93
00:07:40,666 --> 00:07:42,333
I'm sleepy...

94
00:07:46,958 --> 00:07:48,291
That was exhausting.

95
00:07:48,375 --> 00:07:50,750
Yeah, but we haven't
trained in a while.

96
00:07:51,083 --> 00:07:52,708
And thank goodness
you were there, Perrine!

97
00:07:52,791 --> 00:07:54,708
What, so I could nearly drown?

98
00:07:54,791 --> 00:07:56,166
I'm not thankful for that!

99
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:57,958
Honestly!

100
00:08:01,208 --> 00:08:02,333
It's so pretty.

101
00:08:02,416 --> 00:08:03,833
Are you okay, Perrine?

102
00:08:10,708 --> 00:08:11,791
Hey, Francesca!

103
00:08:11,875 --> 00:08:13,083
What are you doing?

104
00:08:13,166 --> 00:08:14,625
Guess what! Guess what!

105
00:08:14,708 --> 00:08:16,833
I found a box under the water!

106
00:08:16,916 --> 00:08:18,583
What?! You did?

107
00:08:18,666 --> 00:08:21,083
Yeah, it's like this big
and has a giant lock on it.

108
00:08:21,166 --> 00:08:23,625
If you ask me,
it's a treasure chest!

109
00:08:23,708 --> 00:08:24,875
Cool!

110
00:08:24,958 --> 00:08:25,958
That's awesome!

111
00:08:26,041 --> 00:08:28,375
Did she just say,
"treasure chest"?!

112
00:08:28,458 --> 00:08:30,166
Well... if you think about it,

113
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:33,083
the Adriatic Sea has always
been an active area for trade...

114
00:08:33,166 --> 00:08:35,166
Actually, it wouldn't
surprise me in the least

115
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:36,250
if there were more than one

116
00:08:36,333 --> 00:08:37,708
of those treasure
chests down there.

117
00:08:37,791 --> 00:08:39,000
That's so cool...!

118
00:08:39,083 --> 00:08:40,541
I think we should
investigate...!

119
00:08:40,625 --> 00:08:41,666
Don't you, Lynne?

120
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:43,208
Sure!

121
00:08:43,291 --> 00:08:44,208
Wait a minute...!

122
00:08:44,291 --> 00:08:45,333
You can't possibly
believe there's

123
00:08:45,416 --> 00:08:47,250
an actual treasure
chest down there...

124
00:08:47,333 --> 00:08:48,416
That's ridiculous!

125
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,291
But you just said
you thought there was!

126
00:08:50,375 --> 00:08:52,541
I did not! I just said
it wouldn't surprise me.

127
00:08:52,625 --> 00:08:54,000
That's totally different!

128
00:09:15,208 --> 00:09:16,958
Oh no!

129
00:09:17,041 --> 00:09:21,416
Lynne! Francesca...!
I gotta go too!

130
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:25,916
Hey! Why are they leaving?

131
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,791
I can't stay down
here much longer...

132
00:09:28,375 --> 00:09:31,458
But... I need this treasure...

133
00:09:34,875 --> 00:09:36,333
For the kids!

134
00:09:38,916 --> 00:09:40,750
Tonnerre!

135
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:53,666
She's been down a long time...

136
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:55,125
Yeah, I'm getting worried.

137
00:09:55,208 --> 00:09:56,833
Hopefully she didn't get eaten.

138
00:09:56,916 --> 00:09:57,833
What?

139
00:09:57,916 --> 00:09:58,958
Didn't you know...?

140
00:09:59,041 --> 00:10:00,500
There're all kinds
of super dangerous,

141
00:10:00,583 --> 00:10:02,750
eat-you-up creatures in the sea.

142
00:10:03,583 --> 00:10:05,041
Like the giant squid...!

143
00:10:05,125 --> 00:10:06,708
And giant sea cucumbers!

144
00:10:06,791 --> 00:10:09,083
There are even giant starfish!

145
00:10:09,625 --> 00:10:11,125
We have to find her
before they get her!

146
00:10:11,208 --> 00:10:12,666
What if we're too late!

147
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,166
Neuroi!

148
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:23,750
Excuse me! Who are you
calling... a Neuroi?!

149
00:10:23,833 --> 00:10:24,958
Oh... it's just Perrine.

150
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:26,625
Out of the way!

151
00:10:28,083 --> 00:10:30,291
Wow, you really wanted
that treasure, huh?

152
00:10:30,375 --> 00:10:33,416
Yes. I really did
want that treasure, huh.

153
00:10:34,208 --> 00:10:36,083
She fainted; oh no!

154
00:10:36,166 --> 00:10:38,125
Perrine...! Perrine!

155
00:10:40,833 --> 00:10:42,500
Did you just hear something?

156
00:10:43,375 --> 00:10:44,583
Nope.

157
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,375
I'm sorry you had
to wait so long!

158
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:02,583
Tada! May I present
your new bridge!

159
00:11:03,958 --> 00:11:07,166
Thank you very much...!
You're the best, Perrine!

160
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,166
No, you are!

161
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:12,375
Perrine!

162
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:14,708
Can you hear me?!

163
00:11:14,791 --> 00:11:17,291
Yes... I'm the greatest.

164
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:18,375
Good. You're okay!

165
00:11:18,458 --> 00:11:19,583
We were so worried!

166
00:11:19,666 --> 00:11:22,083
I bet there's something
really rich in here!

167
00:11:25,125 --> 00:11:27,375
Come on, treasure box...
open up for me!

168
00:11:27,791 --> 00:11:31,375
What do you think you're doing,
Ensign Francesca Lucchini?

169
00:11:31,458 --> 00:11:34,875
I have already decided how that
treasure is going to be used!

170
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:38,416
Look...! It's open!

171
00:11:41,666 --> 00:11:43,083
What the...?

172
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:47,166
That's another chest, isn't it?

173
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:48,666
Yeah...

174
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:49,750
This is good...

175
00:11:49,833 --> 00:11:50,833
That just means the treasure

176
00:11:50,916 --> 00:11:53,000
must be super mega
valuable, then...

177
00:11:53,083 --> 00:11:55,875
I bet it's filled with silver,
gold, and even jewels!

178
00:12:00,916 --> 00:12:02,416
Jeez, how many are there?

179
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:04,625
Every time we open one chest,
there's another one inside...

180
00:12:04,708 --> 00:12:06,041
I want the stupid
treasure already!

181
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:07,958
Will you please
be quiet so I can think?

182
00:12:08,041 --> 00:12:10,125
This one has to be
the last of them...

183
00:12:10,208 --> 00:12:11,750
I'm going to open it.

184
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,791
It's empty.

185
00:12:16,875 --> 00:12:18,708
Oh, the horror!

186
00:12:19,666 --> 00:12:21,041
I can't believe it...

187
00:12:21,125 --> 00:12:24,458
I guess there never
was a treasure...

188
00:12:24,541 --> 00:12:26,916
Perfect... I can't help now...

189
00:12:28,458 --> 00:12:29,916
Please... don't cry!

190
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,875
Yeah... it's just a treasure!

191
00:12:33,958 --> 00:12:35,833
Ha...! Look...! A fort!

192
00:12:36,416 --> 00:12:38,666
I see... You were hoping
you could fix the bridge

193
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:40,458
with the treasure, huh?

194
00:12:40,541 --> 00:12:42,541
Oh, so that explains why
you were acting kind of

195
00:12:42,625 --> 00:12:44,833
different after you
got back from Gallia.

196
00:12:44,916 --> 00:12:46,250
Uh-huh... I thought maybe

197
00:12:46,333 --> 00:12:49,125
this treasure would be
able to help them...

198
00:12:49,208 --> 00:12:50,333
That's okay, though...

199
00:12:50,416 --> 00:12:52,583
I can still sell my
family's last heirloom.

200
00:12:52,666 --> 00:12:54,041
Last...? Oh.

201
00:12:54,125 --> 00:12:56,208
Hey! This is making
a sound, guys!

202
00:12:56,291 --> 00:12:56,750
Like what?

203
00:12:56,833 --> 00:12:58,000
Like a sound...

204
00:12:58,083 --> 00:13:00,375
If it's empty, why's it
making any noise at all?

205
00:13:00,458 --> 00:13:01,458
Listen!

206
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:06,000
Oh! Something's there...!
Hey, give it to me!

207
00:13:08,541 --> 00:13:09,916
There's a little shop
in my neighborhood

208
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,125
that makes secret
boxes like these.

209
00:13:13,041 --> 00:13:14,041
I got it!

210
00:13:14,125 --> 00:13:15,458
What's this paper?

211
00:13:17,708 --> 00:13:18,791
It looks like a map...

212
00:13:18,875 --> 00:13:19,875
You think so?

213
00:13:19,958 --> 00:13:22,083
Yeah, it's a treasure map!

214
00:13:23,708 --> 00:13:24,791
Here's the cave!

215
00:13:24,875 --> 00:13:26,958
Amazing... The map
said it would be there!

216
00:13:27,041 --> 00:13:29,750
Wow, you mean you can
read it...?! That's cool!

217
00:13:29,833 --> 00:13:31,333
You know how to read Latin?

218
00:13:31,416 --> 00:13:33,333
Yes. Every girl
from a decent family

219
00:13:33,416 --> 00:13:35,375
should be well versed in Latin!

220
00:13:35,458 --> 00:13:37,000
Wow!

221
00:13:37,333 --> 00:13:39,541
You know what...? I'm really
glad you're happy again.

222
00:13:39,625 --> 00:13:40,625
What nonsense...!

223
00:13:40,708 --> 00:13:42,083
We need to get a move on...

224
00:13:42,166 --> 00:13:44,375
Well...? Are you coming or not?

225
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:45,708
Right behind you!

226
00:13:48,833 --> 00:13:50,541
Ready...? Let's go!

227
00:13:50,625 --> 00:13:51,708
Right!

228
00:14:07,791 --> 00:14:08,750
It's beautiful.

229
00:14:08,833 --> 00:14:11,291
It's like a sparkling,
starry sky!

230
00:14:11,375 --> 00:14:12,458
The sunlight coming through

231
00:14:12,541 --> 00:14:13,875
the entrance is
reflecting off the water!

232
00:14:13,958 --> 00:14:15,750
Who would've thought
it'd be so pretty?

233
00:14:15,833 --> 00:14:17,375
This is amazing!

234
00:14:24,333 --> 00:14:25,875
Hey, look! There're paths.

235
00:14:28,666 --> 00:14:29,625
Which way?

236
00:14:29,708 --> 00:14:30,875
It seems both of
them will lead us

237
00:14:30,958 --> 00:14:34,291
further inside, but...
let's go to the left!

238
00:14:34,375 --> 00:14:35,291
And which way is that?

239
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:36,416
If you don't wanna
get separated,

240
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,250
be quiet and follow me!

241
00:14:38,333 --> 00:14:39,333
Oh, that left.

242
00:14:39,416 --> 00:14:41,125
Francesca...? She's disappeared?

243
00:14:41,208 --> 00:14:43,666
Yeah. She wanted to
look at fish, which I totally

244
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:46,333
have a problem with,
and she hasn't come back yet.

245
00:14:46,416 --> 00:14:48,291
I bet she's with
Miyafuji's group;

246
00:14:48,375 --> 00:14:49,708
they ran off after training...

247
00:14:49,791 --> 00:14:51,458
We should probably check it out.

248
00:14:51,541 --> 00:14:53,166
Yes. Let's go.

249
00:14:53,708 --> 00:14:55,208
So pretty!

250
00:14:55,291 --> 00:14:58,208
I love how the moss on the wall
just kind of glows like that...

251
00:14:58,291 --> 00:15:00,666
Hey, can you see the map
in this light, Perrine?

252
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:02,333
Yeah? I hope you can...

253
00:15:02,416 --> 00:15:05,625
You're the only one of us who
knows how to read that thing.

254
00:15:05,708 --> 00:15:06,750
No pressure!

255
00:15:06,833 --> 00:15:09,000
No pressure... Gee, thanks.

256
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:11,750
According to this, we'll be safe

257
00:15:11,833 --> 00:15:13,958
if we just keep
going straight ahead.

258
00:15:14,041 --> 00:15:15,250
Seriously?

259
00:15:15,333 --> 00:15:17,708
Yeah...! So... shall we?

260
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:20,833
No! Perrine!

261
00:15:22,083 --> 00:15:23,333
It looks like a pitfall!

262
00:15:23,416 --> 00:15:25,958
It's a pit that I'm
falling in. That's for sure!

263
00:15:26,041 --> 00:15:27,500
Don't worry!
We're not gonna let go!

264
00:15:28,041 --> 00:15:30,416
Straight's not safe... at all.

265
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:32,750
Well?

266
00:15:32,833 --> 00:15:35,041
It's still warm.
Someone was just here...

267
00:15:35,125 --> 00:15:37,125
But apparently
they headed farther in.

268
00:15:37,208 --> 00:15:38,958
Great. Which way did they go?

269
00:15:39,041 --> 00:15:40,875
Maybe we should split up.

270
00:15:40,958 --> 00:15:43,208
No. That would be
much too dangerous.

271
00:15:43,291 --> 00:15:45,208
How about we go right?

272
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Ugh... This is such
a pain in the caboose!

273
00:15:48,083 --> 00:15:50,875
Nah--this is fun!
It's like we're explorers!

274
00:15:50,958 --> 00:15:52,125
This is not a game!

275
00:15:52,208 --> 00:15:54,416
The cave appears to be
man-made, doesn't it?

276
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:56,708
Ancient Witches used
to inhabit this area...

277
00:15:56,791 --> 00:15:59,916
In fact our base actually lies
over some of their ruins...

278
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,500
I suppose this cave could
be an extension of them.

279
00:16:02,583 --> 00:16:03,916
Huh.

280
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:08,416
Look at that...! What an
impressive looking jar.

281
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:11,208
This must be the work of
our early predecessors...

282
00:16:11,583 --> 00:16:12,875
It's incredible.

283
00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:14,500
And beautiful.

284
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:17,583
We're talking
about a jar, right?

285
00:16:21,875 --> 00:16:23,416
Look out!

286
00:16:23,791 --> 00:16:24,333
Major!

287
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:25,875
Major!!

288
00:16:25,958 --> 00:16:30,750
What... what is this?!
Mio...! Mio!

289
00:16:30,833 --> 00:16:32,083
Major!

290
00:16:37,833 --> 00:16:39,000
Good job!

291
00:16:39,083 --> 00:16:41,666
Mio! Say something
to me... Anything...! Mio!

292
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:43,583
Hold on...! You know what...

293
00:16:44,125 --> 00:16:45,625
Smell it... What is that?

294
00:16:47,166 --> 00:16:49,500
Well... it's sure not blood.

295
00:16:49,833 --> 00:16:50,541
It's familiar.

296
00:16:50,625 --> 00:16:51,458
Yeah.

297
00:16:51,541 --> 00:16:53,125
It's wine.

298
00:16:54,291 --> 00:16:55,875
Mio?

299
00:16:55,958 --> 00:16:57,958
Banzai!

300
00:16:59,833 --> 00:17:01,958
You there, Mio...?
It's me, Minna...

301
00:17:02,041 --> 00:17:03,625
Um, can you hear me?

302
00:17:05,333 --> 00:17:08,625
Of course... Hear this!

303
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:14,458
Um... Major?

304
00:17:14,541 --> 00:17:16,083
I... Uh... Oh...

305
00:17:18,958 --> 00:17:21,208
She's running away.

306
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:23,375
Major...! Wait!

307
00:17:23,458 --> 00:17:24,416
I'm confused.

308
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:28,666
What do we do...? Oh no! Minna?

309
00:17:29,625 --> 00:17:31,041
Uh, Minna's out cold.

310
00:17:31,125 --> 00:17:32,250
Okay...?

311
00:17:32,333 --> 00:17:34,875
Yeah... this is not good.

312
00:17:40,083 --> 00:17:42,125
Caves are not supposed
to sound like that!

313
00:17:42,208 --> 00:17:43,833
What if it's a monster?!

314
00:17:43,916 --> 00:17:46,125
You guys! We have to hide!

315
00:17:48,375 --> 00:17:49,541
Did you see that?

316
00:17:49,625 --> 00:17:51,125
Yeah... A person?

317
00:17:51,208 --> 00:17:53,166
It sounds like an
ancient evil spirit!

318
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:54,583
Like a ghost?

319
00:17:55,125 --> 00:17:56,333
Let's go... home!

320
00:17:56,416 --> 00:17:57,875
Maybe we should
just go, Perrine.

321
00:17:57,958 --> 00:18:01,166
No way! I haven't come
all this way for nothing!

322
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:03,416
Hold on, treasure!
I'll be right there!

323
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:04,291
Perrine!

324
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:05,333
Wait!

325
00:18:05,416 --> 00:18:07,916
Wait! Wait!
Don't leave me behind!

326
00:18:10,791 --> 00:18:13,791
Aw, come on... Are we there yet?

327
00:18:13,875 --> 00:18:15,250
Hang in there, Francesca!

328
00:18:15,333 --> 00:18:16,416
Just a little farther!

329
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,833
I'd bet money it's
just beyond this light.

330
00:18:18,916 --> 00:18:20,125
Ya think?

331
00:18:25,791 --> 00:18:27,333
This place is huge!

332
00:18:27,416 --> 00:18:29,666
It has to be the
treasure room on the map!

333
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:30,916
No question about it!

334
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,833
We've finally made it, everyone!

335
00:18:32,916 --> 00:18:34,958
What a big statue...

336
00:18:35,041 --> 00:18:37,916
It's as big as the giant
Buddha statue in Kamakura!

337
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,375
It's kinda scary, if you ask me.

338
00:18:41,458 --> 00:18:42,625
On the other side.

339
00:18:42,708 --> 00:18:44,000
Yes... That's where
the treasure should be.

340
00:18:44,083 --> 00:18:46,458
We're so close
I can almost taste it!

341
00:18:47,208 --> 00:18:48,625
Come on. Let's go!

342
00:18:50,416 --> 00:18:52,833
Oh, cool...! A swordie!

343
00:18:54,375 --> 00:18:57,500
Okay... Where are you...
You should be here!

344
00:18:57,583 --> 00:18:59,416
Treasure...
The children need you!

345
00:19:01,458 --> 00:19:03,875
Duh, duh-duh...! Ta-da...!

346
00:19:03,958 --> 00:19:05,375
What do you think...? Thanks!

347
00:19:05,458 --> 00:19:06,541
You look so cool!

348
00:19:06,625 --> 00:19:09,750
Yeah, you look strong
and really fierce!

349
00:19:12,041 --> 00:19:14,541
I think I might just
have to keep you... yep!

350
00:19:18,375 --> 00:19:19,250
It's moving!

351
00:19:19,333 --> 00:19:21,625
Look out, Perrine! Be careful!

352
00:19:21,708 --> 00:19:24,125
I plan on it!

353
00:19:24,208 --> 00:19:25,333
I won't give up!

354
00:19:25,416 --> 00:19:28,166
Not until the bridge
gets built...! I can't!

355
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:29,791
Although I'm kind
of at a disadvantage,

356
00:19:29,875 --> 00:19:31,458
unarmed like this...

357
00:19:34,958 --> 00:19:36,291
What am I going to do now?

358
00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:37,750
Perrine!

359
00:19:41,666 --> 00:19:44,791
Father! Mother!
People of Gallia!

360
00:19:44,875 --> 00:19:46,875
I shall not be beaten!

361
00:19:54,958 --> 00:19:56,458
Tonnerre!

362
00:19:58,291 --> 00:19:59,500
Wow, you got him!

363
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:10,708
Three cheers
for Perrine! Hooray!

364
00:20:10,791 --> 00:20:11,875
Hooray! And cheers! Hooray!

365
00:20:11,958 --> 00:20:12,958
You did it, Perrine!

366
00:20:13,833 --> 00:20:15,375
Look... There's a door!

367
00:20:16,666 --> 00:20:18,333
It's the treasure!

368
00:20:23,208 --> 00:20:25,208
This is the treasure room?

369
00:20:25,291 --> 00:20:29,416
It's just herbs...?
Cloves and bay leaves...

370
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:33,041
Oregano, saffron...
and that's pepper!

371
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:37,125
Please don't tell me
this is the treasure...

372
00:20:41,125 --> 00:20:42,375
Perrine!

373
00:20:42,458 --> 00:20:45,500
Major Sakamoto, what're
you doing inside of here?

374
00:20:45,583 --> 00:20:47,833
Hey, so what are
you crying about?

375
00:20:48,583 --> 00:20:50,083
Because...

376
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:52,208
Well... I spent
a really long time

377
00:20:52,291 --> 00:20:53,541
looking for this treasure...

378
00:20:53,625 --> 00:20:56,208
but it's just a
bunch of dumb spices...

379
00:20:56,291 --> 00:20:57,375
I'm sure at one point

380
00:20:57,458 --> 00:20:59,500
they must've been
worth a ton of money,

381
00:20:59,583 --> 00:21:02,458
but now they're so easy to find,
they won't help at all...

382
00:21:02,541 --> 00:21:06,375
And now I can't give anything
to the Gallia Restoration Fund.

383
00:21:07,666 --> 00:21:09,458
But that's no reason to cry...

384
00:21:09,541 --> 00:21:12,041
Your feelings are
what truly matter...

385
00:21:12,125 --> 00:21:14,708
It's your love for Gallia
that is the real treasure.

386
00:21:14,791 --> 00:21:16,625
I hope you can see
the truth in that.

387
00:21:16,708 --> 00:21:18,958
Thank you, Major...

388
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:23,291
Hey...! The Major
found Francesca!

389
00:21:23,375 --> 00:21:24,916
And Yoshika, and Lynne...!

390
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,041
Well...? Are you coming
or not, Hartmann?

391
00:21:27,125 --> 00:21:28,833
She's so heavy...

392
00:21:28,916 --> 00:21:30,541
What have you guys been doing?

393
00:21:30,625 --> 00:21:32,416
Oh! Shirley!

394
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:34,041
You had us worried.

395
00:21:37,041 --> 00:21:38,541
Wanna head back?

396
00:21:38,625 --> 00:21:39,916
Sure.

397
00:21:41,458 --> 00:21:42,875
I bet they were ancient ruins,
and the spells the Witches

398
00:21:42,958 --> 00:21:44,625
put on the treasure
were still in place.

399
00:21:44,708 --> 00:21:46,750
That's probably why the
plants were still alive...

400
00:21:46,833 --> 00:21:49,916
And... it's probably why the
statue woke up and attacked you.

401
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,500
How obnoxious was
that statue, am I right?

402
00:21:52,583 --> 00:21:55,750
Oh, yeah...! Here, Perrine.
This letter came for you.

403
00:21:55,833 --> 00:21:58,250
Hey! It's from Gallia...

404
00:22:00,291 --> 00:22:01,541
It's the kids...

405
00:22:01,625 --> 00:22:02,416
The bridge!

406
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:04,125
Everyone must've helped fix it!

407
00:22:04,208 --> 00:22:07,541
They worked together
to rebuild the bridge...

408
00:22:07,625 --> 00:22:11,333
I guess we always had
the real treasure after all...

409
00:22:11,708 --> 00:22:12,958
I'm so happy.

410
00:22:13,041 --> 00:22:15,041
That's a relief, huh?

411
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:16,625
Yes. I need to help defeat

412
00:22:16,708 --> 00:22:18,416
the Neuroi as
quickly as possible...!

413
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:20,541
That way I can return to Gallia!

414
00:22:20,625 --> 00:22:21,875
We should go too, Lynne!

415
00:22:21,958 --> 00:22:23,416
Sure...! Why not?!

416
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:26,666
Oh really...?
Well, then I'll be kind enough

417
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:29,250
to at least show
the two of you around.

418
00:22:30,125 --> 00:22:32,000
Wow, thank you, Perrine!

419
00:22:35,916 --> 00:22:37,708
I gotta a really bad sunburn.

420
00:22:37,791 --> 00:22:39,458
I can't even put on my tights.

421
00:22:40,583 --> 00:22:43,416
Interesting...
What a mysterious base...

422
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:46,166
On a side note...
Have you all seen Minna?

423
00:24:29,333 --> 00:24:30,500
Hey, Hartmann!

424
00:24:30,583 --> 00:24:31,541
How many aircraft
have you shot down?

425
00:24:31,625 --> 00:24:35,166
One, two, three... I dunno...

426
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:39,666
On the next Strike Witches 2:
"Five Hundred Overs."

427
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:40,916
So, how many is that?
