1
00:00:25,541 --> 00:00:27,416
End of the line, Neuroi!

2
00:00:29,958 --> 00:00:31,458
The Magic Dynamo has shut down.

3
00:00:31,541 --> 00:00:34,250
It's no use... The main
cannons will not respond!

4
00:00:34,333 --> 00:00:36,583
No! This can't be happening!

5
00:00:41,958 --> 00:00:45,416
All ships, hard to port!
Withdraw immediately!

6
00:00:46,583 --> 00:00:47,625
Not yet.

7
00:00:47,708 --> 00:00:49,250
This isn't over.

8
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:51,833
I've still got strength left...

9
00:00:51,916 --> 00:00:55,166
This fight's not done...
and neither am I!

10
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:56,333
Mio, no!

11
00:00:56,416 --> 00:00:57,833
I'm going to board the Yamato.

12
00:00:57,916 --> 00:00:59,791
I have just enough
magic power left...

13
00:00:59,875 --> 00:01:01,541
to restart the Dynamo.

14
00:01:01,625 --> 00:01:02,458
No, Mio.

15
00:01:02,541 --> 00:01:04,333
No! Come back!

16
00:02:43,375 --> 00:02:45,833
Major Sakamoto, are
you trying to kill yourself?

17
00:02:45,916 --> 00:02:48,458
You can't do this alone...
Come back here!

18
00:02:48,541 --> 00:02:49,625
You're nuts!

19
00:02:49,708 --> 00:02:52,458
Listen, Major...
Your magic is almost gone.

20
00:02:52,541 --> 00:02:54,375
There's no way this will work.

21
00:02:55,541 --> 00:02:56,958
Miyafuji, how did you know...?

22
00:02:57,041 --> 00:02:59,625
You're right...
My magic is nearly gone...

23
00:02:59,708 --> 00:03:02,000
I only have just
enough left to fly.

24
00:03:03,291 --> 00:03:05,083
You have to stop.
That's an order.

25
00:03:05,166 --> 00:03:07,375
I can't...

26
00:03:07,458 --> 00:03:09,375
I'm not asking. Now go!

27
00:03:09,458 --> 00:03:11,541
I'm the only one left...

28
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:14,041
The Yamato must be reactivated.

29
00:03:16,125 --> 00:03:17,416
Funny, isn't it...

30
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:20,083
My weakness was what
kept me from fighting before...

31
00:03:20,166 --> 00:03:23,708
but now I'm the only one with
enough magic left to do the job.

32
00:03:24,541 --> 00:03:25,708
Please don't...

33
00:03:25,791 --> 00:03:28,166
Minna... please you
have to understand...

34
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:30,125
if there's still something
I can do to help,

35
00:03:30,208 --> 00:03:31,791
then I have to do it...

36
00:03:31,875 --> 00:03:35,291
I'm still a Witch
from the 501st...

37
00:03:35,375 --> 00:03:38,083
I can still be one
of the eleven...

38
00:03:39,666 --> 00:03:41,125
Mio...

39
00:03:41,875 --> 00:03:43,500
I can't watch...

40
00:03:45,083 --> 00:03:46,208
You listen...

41
00:03:46,291 --> 00:03:48,958
Major... I want you
to come back to me...

42
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,666
That's a direct order...

43
00:03:54,625 --> 00:03:56,375
Understood.

44
00:03:59,958 --> 00:04:01,000
Major!

45
00:04:01,083 --> 00:04:02,541
She's really letting her do it!

46
00:04:02,625 --> 00:04:05,083
Yoshika, wait.
Where are you going?

47
00:04:07,291 --> 00:04:08,708
Hold on!

48
00:04:11,291 --> 00:04:12,625
You can't help her!

49
00:04:12,708 --> 00:04:14,208
Let go of me! Stop!

50
00:04:14,291 --> 00:04:15,416
No! Not a chance...

51
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,250
You used up all your
magic during the battle

52
00:04:17,333 --> 00:04:19,958
just like the rest of us, so
there's nothing we can do.

53
00:04:20,041 --> 00:04:21,791
I can't just sit here.

54
00:04:25,291 --> 00:04:27,875
I know... I feel so useless.

55
00:04:27,958 --> 00:04:31,000
Even if we could...
still, we'd be too late.

56
00:04:31,083 --> 00:04:33,791
We can't... give up.

57
00:04:33,875 --> 00:04:34,875
It's over...

58
00:04:35,833 --> 00:04:38,791
I'm sorry, Miyafuji...
I'm a warrior...

59
00:04:38,875 --> 00:04:42,125
The one place I truly
belong is on the battlefield.

60
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:47,208
This is the only life I've
ever wanted... I have to go.

61
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:53,708
Shidenkai...
Get me to the Yamato...

62
00:04:53,791 --> 00:04:55,291
You hear me?!

63
00:04:55,375 --> 00:04:57,583
Don't fail me now!

64
00:05:05,708 --> 00:05:07,541
Captain, the Magic
Dynamo is responding.

65
00:05:07,625 --> 00:05:09,375
What? The Major made it?

66
00:05:21,666 --> 00:05:23,333
The Dynamo is
now fully online...

67
00:05:23,416 --> 00:05:25,000
Output is rising.

68
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:27,250
She did it... It worked!

69
00:05:27,333 --> 00:05:29,791
Well, good... We wait...

70
00:05:29,875 --> 00:05:33,000
since we can no longer remotely
operate it from down here...

71
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:36,583
You're our only hope
now, Major Sakamoto...

72
00:05:36,666 --> 00:05:38,375
Don't let us down.

73
00:05:45,708 --> 00:05:48,666
That's it... More power...
More power.

74
00:05:52,666 --> 00:05:55,375
I see... So you're
depending solely on me

75
00:05:55,458 --> 00:05:56,916
to guide you through this...

76
00:05:58,375 --> 00:06:01,166
All right, then...
Let's go, Yamato.

77
00:06:02,041 --> 00:06:03,500
Output at eighty percent.

78
00:06:03,583 --> 00:06:06,041
Thirty seconds until Neuroi
transformation reaches critical.

79
00:06:07,125 --> 00:06:08,125
Oh no...

80
00:06:08,208 --> 00:06:10,791
Is she okay?

81
00:06:11,166 --> 00:06:12,625
Output at ninety percent.

82
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:17,833
At least I die as a warrior now!

83
00:06:17,916 --> 00:06:19,375
One hundred percent!

84
00:06:20,708 --> 00:06:22,791
Fire.

85
00:06:51,958 --> 00:06:54,500
I'm not detecting
Neuroi... they're gone.

86
00:06:54,583 --> 00:06:56,291
What about the Major?

87
00:06:56,375 --> 00:06:58,625
Oh please...

88
00:07:02,375 --> 00:07:03,625
They've been destroyed...

89
00:07:03,708 --> 00:07:05,916
The Yamato
couldn't survive that.

90
00:07:06,875 --> 00:07:08,416
Mio...

91
00:07:10,416 --> 00:07:12,791
Radar contact, sir...
It's the Yamato!

92
00:07:12,875 --> 00:07:15,625
No... In the middle
of that explosion?

93
00:07:19,375 --> 00:07:21,000
Look! There she is!

94
00:07:21,083 --> 00:07:22,458
What a ship!

95
00:07:22,541 --> 00:07:25,041
If the Yamato's all right,
then the Major must be, too.

96
00:07:26,583 --> 00:07:28,125
She did it... All right.

97
00:07:28,208 --> 00:07:29,833
We win!

98
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:32,291
Yeah... Wow... that was close.

99
00:07:34,375 --> 00:07:37,750
Something's not right... It
still looks like it's a Neuroi.

100
00:07:41,666 --> 00:07:43,166
Explain that...

101
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:45,916
The transformation should have
fully worn off a long time ago.

102
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,583
I'm detecting the Neuroi again.

103
00:07:47,666 --> 00:07:48,875
What do you mean?

104
00:07:56,333 --> 00:07:57,250
What's that?

105
00:07:57,333 --> 00:07:59,250
Oh no... the core.

106
00:07:59,333 --> 00:08:01,958
I've never seen a
Neuroi core that big!

107
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:19,958
The Neuroi is attacking us, sir!

108
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:22,291
All ships, evasive action.

109
00:08:22,375 --> 00:08:23,875
It took out that
ship with one shot.

110
00:08:23,958 --> 00:08:25,833
How'd they become so strong?

111
00:08:26,375 --> 00:08:27,583
Up there!

112
00:08:34,375 --> 00:08:35,583
They trapped her!

113
00:08:35,666 --> 00:08:36,916
No, Major!

114
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,875
Let's cut her loose...
Firing main guns!

115
00:08:44,291 --> 00:08:45,625
The rounds didn't impact...

116
00:08:45,708 --> 00:08:47,291
The Neuroi stopped
them in midair.

117
00:08:47,375 --> 00:08:48,708
What? Impossible.

118
00:08:48,791 --> 00:08:49,875
They've got shields.

119
00:08:49,958 --> 00:08:51,750
The Neuroi's
generating defenses.

120
00:08:51,833 --> 00:08:53,208
This can't be real...

121
00:08:53,291 --> 00:08:54,541
I don't believe it...

122
00:08:54,625 --> 00:08:56,875
Those look like... shields!

123
00:08:56,958 --> 00:08:59,375
No doubt about it...
the Neuroi...

124
00:08:59,458 --> 00:09:01,708
It's tapped into
the Major's energy.

125
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:05,125
Captain. Our attacks
have no effect.

126
00:09:05,208 --> 00:09:07,416
I never thought
the Neuroi'd be able

127
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,750
to use our shields against us.

128
00:09:09,833 --> 00:09:11,541
There isn't anything we can do

129
00:09:11,625 --> 00:09:14,375
to stop their onslaught
now except wait.

130
00:09:15,458 --> 00:09:16,708
No...

131
00:09:19,041 --> 00:09:20,541
Not incredible enough...

132
00:09:20,625 --> 00:09:22,791
It's a highly secretive
and antique technique

133
00:09:22,875 --> 00:09:24,083
of the Fuso Empire...

134
00:09:24,166 --> 00:09:26,375
Its power can
destroy any Neuroi...

135
00:09:26,458 --> 00:09:28,750
with a single blow, at that...

136
00:09:28,833 --> 00:09:30,875
I just have to master it.

137
00:09:32,625 --> 00:09:34,708
The Shin-Reppuzan...

138
00:09:40,791 --> 00:09:42,125
The Littorio has been sunk!

139
00:09:42,208 --> 00:09:43,416
Prepare for air combat.

140
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:46,125
All noncombatants,
seek shelter inside.

141
00:09:46,208 --> 00:09:47,208
Is anyone hurt?

142
00:09:47,291 --> 00:09:48,458
If this keeps up
we're all going to die!

143
00:09:48,541 --> 00:09:50,583
Isn't there anything we can do?

144
00:09:50,666 --> 00:09:52,291
I'm afraid not...

145
00:09:52,375 --> 00:09:54,041
None of us can even fly now...

146
00:09:54,125 --> 00:09:56,458
We've used up too
much of our magic...

147
00:09:59,625 --> 00:10:01,000
Where's Yoshika?

148
00:10:12,083 --> 00:10:13,375
Here it comes...

149
00:10:13,458 --> 00:10:15,166
this is the end.

150
00:10:17,875 --> 00:10:20,000
Captain, the central
elevator is moving.

151
00:10:20,083 --> 00:10:21,125
Someone's on it.

152
00:10:21,208 --> 00:10:22,458
What's that?

153
00:10:40,916 --> 00:10:42,458
I'm coming, Major.

154
00:10:55,416 --> 00:10:56,375
Yoshika, stop!

155
00:10:56,458 --> 00:10:58,250
You know what
this is... suicide.

156
00:10:58,333 --> 00:11:00,291
What are you doing... You can't.

157
00:11:00,375 --> 00:11:02,041
Explain yourself, immediately.

158
00:11:02,125 --> 00:11:04,583
I'm going to save
Major Sakamoto.

159
00:11:04,666 --> 00:11:06,125
But how...?

160
00:11:06,208 --> 00:11:08,333
You can't possibly have any
magic energy left to fight...

161
00:11:08,416 --> 00:11:09,625
Even if you can fly,

162
00:11:09,708 --> 00:11:12,000
you can't expect to
defeat that Neuroi alone.

163
00:11:12,083 --> 00:11:15,166
Yes I can...
With the Shin-Reppuzan.

164
00:11:15,916 --> 00:11:17,208
The Shin-Reppuzan?

165
00:11:17,291 --> 00:11:19,708
But... that's the
Major's technique.

166
00:11:19,791 --> 00:11:22,291
And the Reppumaru is
nowhere to be found.

167
00:11:22,375 --> 00:11:24,458
Not true... It's there.

168
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,916
I don't believe it.

169
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:32,958
The Reppumaru...

170
00:11:33,041 --> 00:11:35,166
It wasn't destroyed.

171
00:11:37,625 --> 00:11:38,791
Yoshika, don't.

172
00:11:38,875 --> 00:11:40,166
Takeoff!

173
00:11:43,041 --> 00:11:45,416
It's no good.
Her energy is too unstable.

174
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:48,208
Just look... She can't even fly.

175
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:50,541
Yoshika, you can do it!

176
00:11:50,625 --> 00:11:52,791
Heck yeah! Keep flying!

177
00:11:52,875 --> 00:11:53,916
Just a little more.

178
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,166
You can do it, Yoshika.

179
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:57,208
Maybe she can...

180
00:11:57,291 --> 00:11:58,916
Oh.

181
00:12:01,375 --> 00:12:03,375
Come on now... Keep it going!

182
00:12:03,458 --> 00:12:05,958
Your Striker...
It's a part of you!

183
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,958
Visualize the Striker as
an extension of your body...

184
00:12:11,041 --> 00:12:12,750
Imagine that your
legs are moving forward

185
00:12:12,833 --> 00:12:15,000
and put magic
behind that thought.

186
00:12:19,708 --> 00:12:20,875
Where'd she go?

187
00:12:27,791 --> 00:12:28,833
She did it!

188
00:12:28,916 --> 00:12:29,875
Yeah she did!

189
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:31,166
Way to go.

190
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:34,375
Yoshika... you're amazing.

191
00:12:34,458 --> 00:12:37,500
That girl...
She's really unbelievable.

192
00:12:38,333 --> 00:12:40,333
She's flying...

193
00:12:45,291 --> 00:12:48,875
But how...? How is
Yoshika able to fly?

194
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:50,916
You know she's
always been like that.

195
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,625
And maybe she's
not the only one.

196
00:12:57,166 --> 00:12:58,666
What are you doing?

197
00:13:00,958 --> 00:13:02,375
I'm coming!

198
00:13:19,333 --> 00:13:21,625
No good... I can't
break through all of them.

199
00:13:36,083 --> 00:13:37,583
What's going on?

200
00:13:42,791 --> 00:13:43,875
Miyafuji...

201
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:50,208
A shield? But how?

202
00:13:52,166 --> 00:13:53,958
Get out of here, Miyafuji.

203
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:56,000
But, Major!

204
00:13:56,083 --> 00:13:58,583
It's a waste of time...
Get out of here!

205
00:14:00,041 --> 00:14:02,208
The Neuroi has me trapped
and is using my magic

206
00:14:02,291 --> 00:14:03,875
to generate its own shields...

207
00:14:03,958 --> 00:14:06,291
There's no way
you can destroy it.

208
00:14:09,666 --> 00:14:12,000
There's nothing
a Witch can't do.

209
00:14:13,583 --> 00:14:16,291
You taught me that,
Major Sakamoto.

210
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:19,458
Miyafuji.

211
00:14:19,541 --> 00:14:23,083
Don't worry... Nothing
can make me give up now.

212
00:14:29,916 --> 00:14:30,833
Right on time...

213
00:14:30,916 --> 00:14:32,750
We're behind you all the way...

214
00:14:33,791 --> 00:14:35,083
You came!

215
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:37,541
Okay, ladies...
Victor formation...

216
00:14:37,625 --> 00:14:40,291
Let's give her some cover.

217
00:14:40,375 --> 00:14:41,750
Right.

218
00:14:45,041 --> 00:14:47,000
We all know that you
can do it, Yoshika...

219
00:14:47,083 --> 00:14:49,458
Defeat the Neuroi...
That's an order!

220
00:14:49,541 --> 00:14:50,875
Right!

221
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:56,708
I want you to kick
its butt, on the double.

222
00:15:01,958 --> 00:15:03,791
We'll make a
clear path for you...

223
00:15:03,875 --> 00:15:05,291
Now go... Take it down...

224
00:15:05,375 --> 00:15:08,000
You can knock
this out no problem!

225
00:15:10,208 --> 00:15:14,375
Go, Yoshika...
Make us proud... Tonnere!

226
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:21,166
If anyone can do this, it's you.

227
00:15:31,791 --> 00:15:34,875
Good fortune's in your
cards today... Never fear.

228
00:15:38,666 --> 00:15:40,583
Go! Fight! Win!

229
00:15:45,083 --> 00:15:47,208
Almost there... Keep it up!

230
00:16:08,041 --> 00:16:09,458
The Reppumaru...

231
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:20,750
I can't...

232
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Go, Shinden...! More power!

233
00:16:51,791 --> 00:16:52,500
It's out...

234
00:16:52,583 --> 00:16:53,833
Good girl!

235
00:16:58,291 --> 00:16:59,541
Here I come!

236
00:16:59,625 --> 00:17:00,791
Stop, Miyafuji.

237
00:17:00,875 --> 00:17:03,625
The Reppumaru will drain
all your magic power!

238
00:17:03,708 --> 00:17:05,833
It doesn't matter...

239
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,000
Don't let go...

240
00:17:10,375 --> 00:17:14,250
All I want... is to make
sure everyone is safe.

241
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:16,416
It's all I ever dreamed of...

242
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:24,291
Please, Reppumaru...

243
00:17:24,375 --> 00:17:26,791
I'll let you have all
the rest of my magic...

244
00:17:26,875 --> 00:17:28,958
Just help me
destroy the Neuroi...

245
00:17:29,041 --> 00:17:31,416
That's all I'm asking of you.

246
00:17:32,208 --> 00:17:36,208
Now it's time...
Unleash the Shin-Reppuzan.

247
00:17:50,125 --> 00:17:51,708
Miyafuji.

248
00:17:51,791 --> 00:17:54,875
Reppuzan.

249
00:18:34,583 --> 00:18:35,708
I'm not picking it up...

250
00:18:35,791 --> 00:18:38,166
The Neuroi signal is gone now.

251
00:18:39,291 --> 00:18:40,416
Where are they?

252
00:18:43,416 --> 00:18:45,375
Look! Up there!

253
00:19:03,583 --> 00:19:04,750
Wake up...

254
00:19:10,833 --> 00:19:12,125
You're all right!

255
00:19:13,583 --> 00:19:15,166
I'm sorry...

256
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:17,000
Your magic... it's all gone...

257
00:19:17,083 --> 00:19:20,625
It's okay...
I protected everyone...

258
00:19:20,708 --> 00:19:23,000
That was my wish all along.

259
00:19:25,208 --> 00:19:26,541
I see...

260
00:19:28,166 --> 00:19:30,666
Miyafuji ... thank you.

261
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:33,750
Now... what do we do
since we both can't fly?

262
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:38,500
We should be okay...

263
00:19:38,583 --> 00:19:40,583
There's eleven
Strike Witches, after all.

264
00:19:40,666 --> 00:19:43,125
That's right... We're not alone.

265
00:19:43,458 --> 00:19:46,916
Yoshika, I'm coming!

266
00:19:47,458 --> 00:19:48,958
Me too!

267
00:19:49,041 --> 00:19:50,250
Right behind you.

268
00:19:50,333 --> 00:19:52,125
Major!

269
00:20:19,708 --> 00:20:21,125
Minna...

270
00:20:22,666 --> 00:20:25,708
I came back here...
just as you ordered me.

271
00:20:30,083 --> 00:20:31,916
Welcome back, Mio.

272
00:20:34,708 --> 00:20:39,166
Oh yeah...!
The Neuroi are finally gone.

273
00:20:41,041 --> 00:20:43,291
Romagna is totally free.

274
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:46,000
Oh yes. Oh yes. Oh yes!

275
00:20:46,083 --> 00:20:50,000
I knew we could do it!
I knew it! Woo-hoo!

276
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:52,208
They're all gone... We did it.

277
00:20:52,875 --> 00:20:54,041
Yeah.

278
00:21:19,958 --> 00:21:22,958
I used up all of my magic
during this battle...

279
00:21:23,041 --> 00:21:26,458
It took everything
I had to save my friends...

280
00:21:26,541 --> 00:21:29,708
I doubt I'll ever soar through
the sky as a Witch again.

281
00:21:30,875 --> 00:21:33,333
But I don't regret it one bit.

282
00:21:33,416 --> 00:21:34,958
After all, I was able

283
00:21:35,041 --> 00:21:38,125
to protect my best friends
in the whole world...

284
00:21:38,208 --> 00:21:41,333
I was able to make
my wish come true.

285
00:21:44,541 --> 00:21:45,833
It's over.

286
00:21:46,583 --> 00:21:48,375
Yes.

287
00:21:48,458 --> 00:21:52,458
Mission complete. All Strike
Witches, return to base!

288
00:21:52,541 --> 00:21:54,041
Yes, Ma'am!

289
00:21:55,583 --> 00:21:57,708
In July of 1945...

290
00:21:57,791 --> 00:22:00,041
the Neuroi above
Venezia and Romagna

291
00:22:00,125 --> 00:22:03,791
were successfully eradicated
once and for all...

292
00:22:03,875 --> 00:22:06,583
Thus, the 501st
Joint Fighter Wing,

293
00:22:06,666 --> 00:22:09,250
known to the rest of the
world as the Strike Witches,

294
00:22:09,333 --> 00:22:11,375
was officially disbanded.

295
00:23:00,208 --> 00:23:01,750
What is that you're reading?

296
00:23:02,458 --> 00:23:04,041
None of your business.

297
00:23:07,791 --> 00:23:09,083
Looks like our competition

298
00:23:09,166 --> 00:23:12,458
is on hold until next time,
Lieutenant Hartmann...

299
00:23:14,375 --> 00:23:16,875
As of now... the 504th
Joint Fighter Wing,...

300
00:23:16,958 --> 00:23:18,875
is officially being
placed in charge

301
00:23:18,958 --> 00:23:21,333
of defending the skies
of Romagna and Venezia.

302
00:23:21,416 --> 00:23:22,500
It's about time...

303
00:23:22,583 --> 00:23:23,875
It should be us Romagnans

304
00:23:23,958 --> 00:23:26,125
who protect our beloved
homeland from danger.

305
00:23:26,208 --> 00:23:27,958
If I'm not mistaken...

306
00:23:28,041 --> 00:23:30,375
there's a Romagnan
in the 501st, too...

307
00:23:30,458 --> 00:23:31,666
Never mind that...

308
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:34,041
Let's all go clothes
shopping in Rome.

309
00:23:34,708 --> 00:23:35,791
Captain Takei.

310
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,458
I have a letter for you.

311
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:40,666
Amaki, look out.

312
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:49,875
Oopsie.

313
00:23:59,375 --> 00:24:00,875
Yoshika.

314
00:24:00,958 --> 00:24:02,750
Oh, Michiko.

315
00:24:02,833 --> 00:24:05,125
The bird... is it okay?

316
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:10,791
See. It's just fine.

317
00:24:10,875 --> 00:24:12,125
That's so wonderful!

318
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:14,750
Wow.
