1
00:00:26,791 --> 00:00:29,291
Reppuzan!

2
00:00:34,458 --> 00:00:36,041
Wow, you did it, Major!

3
00:00:36,125 --> 00:00:37,333
Excellent job, ma'am.

4
00:00:37,416 --> 00:00:38,416
Yes!

5
00:00:40,583 --> 00:00:42,166
Major? Is something wrong?

6
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:44,541
No, it's nothing.

7
00:00:59,625 --> 00:01:03,583
My magic is fading...
it's nearly gone...

8
00:02:51,041 --> 00:02:53,583
Major Sakamoto! It's Miyafuji!

9
00:02:53,666 --> 00:02:55,875
Commander Minna
has a message for you!

10
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:59,708
Are you there? That's weird.

11
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:03,125
Major Sakamoto?

12
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:05,000
She's not here.

13
00:03:08,083 --> 00:03:10,083
I bet she's still
training outside.

14
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:13,833
The Reppumaru...

15
00:03:14,666 --> 00:03:15,791
I must master it...

16
00:03:15,875 --> 00:03:18,125
Reppusan that transcends
the Reppuzan...

17
00:03:18,208 --> 00:03:20,333
Shin-Reppuzan.

18
00:03:20,416 --> 00:03:22,708
Oh... A Shin-Reppuzan?

19
00:03:22,791 --> 00:03:24,500
Yes... It's a highly secretive

20
00:03:24,583 --> 00:03:26,750
and antique technique
of the Fuso Empire...

21
00:03:26,833 --> 00:03:28,583
Its power can
destroy any Neuroi...

22
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:30,791
with a single blow, at that...

23
00:03:30,875 --> 00:03:32,958
I just have to master it.

24
00:03:46,041 --> 00:03:48,375
Wow...! So this
is the Reppumaru...?

25
00:03:54,458 --> 00:03:55,583
Miyafuji!

26
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,500
Snap out of it, Miyafuji!

27
00:04:01,041 --> 00:04:02,291
Was I asleep?

28
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:04,083
Thank goodness... Can you stand?

29
00:04:04,166 --> 00:04:06,375
Yes...

30
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:12,208
I know I messed up...
but that sword--

31
00:04:12,291 --> 00:04:13,541
You idiot!

32
00:04:13,625 --> 00:04:15,750
You are never to touch
this sword again!

33
00:04:15,833 --> 00:04:17,541
Is that clear?!

34
00:04:17,625 --> 00:04:21,250
Yes, ma'am... Please forgive me.

35
00:04:33,541 --> 00:04:34,583
There they go...

36
00:04:34,666 --> 00:04:36,666
Who just left in that transport?

37
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:38,875
Major Sakamoto
and Commander Minna.

38
00:04:38,958 --> 00:04:41,625
They have a meeting to
go to at headquarters...

39
00:04:42,541 --> 00:04:44,000
So what's wrong?

40
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:45,708
It's the first time
in a long time

41
00:04:45,791 --> 00:04:48,125
that I made the
Major angry with me.

42
00:04:49,125 --> 00:04:50,708
Hey... There they are!

43
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:52,250
Hello!

44
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:53,583
Hey! Whoo! Whoo! Hey!

45
00:04:53,666 --> 00:04:55,125
We're over here...
Come on, guys.

46
00:04:59,416 --> 00:05:02,375
Let's go!

47
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:11,791
I don't understand why
everyone's taking a bath

48
00:05:11,875 --> 00:05:13,708
so early in the
morning like this.

49
00:05:13,791 --> 00:05:15,750
Captain Barkhorn thinks
we'll be deployed soon,

50
00:05:15,833 --> 00:05:17,708
so we should relax
as much as we can.

51
00:05:17,791 --> 00:05:19,083
After all, you never know

52
00:05:19,166 --> 00:05:21,625
which bath is going
to be your very last.

53
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,500
Yeah, Minna and
the Major went to HQ

54
00:05:24,583 --> 00:05:27,416
so it looks like the final
operation is coming up soon.

55
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:29,041
That sounds bad.

56
00:05:29,125 --> 00:05:31,291
The final operation?

57
00:05:31,375 --> 00:05:32,833
That's right...

58
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:35,000
We're going to launch a full
frontal assault on the Neuroi.

59
00:05:35,083 --> 00:05:37,333
The main hive over Venezia.

60
00:05:39,625 --> 00:05:41,125
You can't be serious!

61
00:05:41,208 --> 00:05:43,583
General...Our Witches
are fully prepared.

62
00:05:43,666 --> 00:05:46,166
You can't sideline us
at the last minute.

63
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:48,500
You're not being cut out.

64
00:05:48,583 --> 00:05:50,250
The Witches simply won't be

65
00:05:50,333 --> 00:05:52,666
the main force used
to destroy the hive...

66
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:54,916
That's all.

67
00:05:55,708 --> 00:05:58,666
This is no ordinary
operation, Commander...

68
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:00,750
and your 501st
has never actually

69
00:06:00,833 --> 00:06:02,666
taken a Neuroi Hive in battle.

70
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:06,000
And that's experience
we'll need, don't you think?

71
00:06:06,083 --> 00:06:08,375
I understand that,
sir... However...

72
00:06:08,458 --> 00:06:10,125
Commander Minna...

73
00:06:10,208 --> 00:06:11,375
The lead battle group

74
00:06:11,458 --> 00:06:13,875
for this operation has
already been chosen...

75
00:06:13,958 --> 00:06:16,500
Isn't that right,
Captain Sugita?

76
00:06:18,458 --> 00:06:20,750
Yes. The Fuso Imperial
Battleship Yamato

77
00:06:20,833 --> 00:06:22,083
is honored, sir...

78
00:06:22,166 --> 00:06:24,041
I firmly believe that
destroying the Neuroi hive

79
00:06:24,125 --> 00:06:25,833
will be her finest hour.

80
00:06:25,916 --> 00:06:27,333
With respect...

81
00:06:27,416 --> 00:06:29,041
A conventional war machine
like the Yamato isn't designed

82
00:06:29,125 --> 00:06:33,000
to be effective against
an airborne Neuroi hive!

83
00:06:33,083 --> 00:06:35,708
Since our most
recent modifications,

84
00:06:35,791 --> 00:06:38,541
there is nothing
'conventional' about it...

85
00:06:38,625 --> 00:06:41,875
The battleship Yamato is now
this military's ultimate weapon.

86
00:06:41,958 --> 00:06:44,291
A lie... No way.

87
00:06:44,375 --> 00:06:46,291
I assure you, it's not.

88
00:06:46,375 --> 00:06:49,500
The Warlock experiment
conducted in Gallia showed us

89
00:06:49,583 --> 00:06:51,166
the future of weaponry,

90
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:53,291
and now the Fuso Navy
has finally succeeded

91
00:06:53,375 --> 00:06:56,166
in developing a more
stable core control system.

92
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:58,333
It begins to degrade
after ten minutes,

93
00:06:58,416 --> 00:07:01,583
but we now have the ability to
transform a ship into a Neuroi

94
00:07:01,666 --> 00:07:03,666
and keep it under
complete control.

95
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:06,291
You're going to turn the
Yamato into a Neuroi?!

96
00:07:06,375 --> 00:07:07,916
That's insane.

97
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,916
The Neuroi can only be
defeated by their own kind.

98
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,583
The Witches are simply incapable
of destroying the hive.

99
00:07:14,666 --> 00:07:16,458
There's nothing we can't do!

100
00:07:16,541 --> 00:07:19,000
Once mastered,
my Shin-Reppuzan will be able

101
00:07:19,083 --> 00:07:21,791
to take down an
entire Neuroi hive!

102
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:23,333
I'm certain it can.

103
00:07:24,375 --> 00:07:25,958
Watch your tone, Major.

104
00:07:26,041 --> 00:07:29,375
At your tender age, you're
lucky we haven't relieved you

105
00:07:29,458 --> 00:07:31,375
from active duty already.

106
00:07:32,791 --> 00:07:34,791
If this operation
with the Yamato fails,

107
00:07:34,875 --> 00:07:36,166
we'll have no choice.

108
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:38,625
The only thing left will
be to surrender Romagna.

109
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:41,833
If that happens, the 501st
will see plenty of action

110
00:07:41,916 --> 00:07:43,375
guarding our withdrawal.

111
00:07:43,458 --> 00:07:46,416
and that, I'm afraid,
will be your final mission...

112
00:07:48,416 --> 00:07:49,916
This meeting is over.

113
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,541
Operation Mars will commence
tomorrow at ten hundred hours.

114
00:07:53,625 --> 00:07:54,583
General!

115
00:07:54,666 --> 00:07:56,625
That's enough, Major Sakamoto!

116
00:07:57,375 --> 00:07:58,791
Commander!

117
00:07:58,875 --> 00:08:01,333
The 501st Joint Fighter Wing
will provide extra defenses

118
00:08:01,416 --> 00:08:04,666
to the Yamato as it
charges the enemy Neuroi!

119
00:08:06,208 --> 00:08:08,083
Understood, General.

120
00:08:15,291 --> 00:08:16,708
We will launch a
full frontal assault

121
00:08:16,791 --> 00:08:19,166
on the Hive with every
ounce of muscle we have.

122
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:20,708
We'll only have one shot.

123
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:24,375
This is a simple plan, but
that doesn't mean it's easy.

124
00:08:24,458 --> 00:08:26,791
What happens if we fail?

125
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:29,458
If we fail, we will be forced

126
00:08:29,541 --> 00:08:32,333
to abandon all of
Romagna to the Neroi...

127
00:08:32,416 --> 00:08:35,916
...and the 501st Joint Fighter
Wing will be no more...

128
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:40,041
Giving up?!
Disbanding our squad...?

129
00:08:40,125 --> 00:08:41,958
Those are the
orders of a coward!

130
00:08:42,041 --> 00:08:44,458
Please don't tell me you agree
with this farce, Commander.

131
00:08:44,541 --> 00:08:46,500
You know me better than that!

132
00:08:48,375 --> 00:08:51,333
Of course I don't
agree with our orders.

133
00:08:51,791 --> 00:08:54,666
But I... I can see that
we don't have enough strength

134
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:56,958
to continue indefinitely.

135
00:08:57,041 --> 00:08:58,708
We're fighting a war
of attrition against

136
00:08:58,791 --> 00:09:00,791
an enemy that never tires.

137
00:09:00,875 --> 00:09:04,875
If we don't win... there's
only one option left.

138
00:09:05,458 --> 00:09:06,791
Surrender...

139
00:09:06,875 --> 00:09:08,166
It can't be true.

140
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:10,083
Please, no...

141
00:09:20,958 --> 00:09:23,333
It'll pass... don't you worry...

142
00:09:23,416 --> 00:09:25,500
We won't let any Neuroi
destroy your hometown.

143
00:09:25,583 --> 00:09:26,541
I promise.

144
00:09:26,625 --> 00:09:27,833
We just need to win.

145
00:09:27,916 --> 00:09:30,333
Yeah, c'mon, we
haven't even fought it yet.

146
00:09:30,416 --> 00:09:31,375
That's right!

147
00:09:31,458 --> 00:09:32,625
Yeah. Cheer up.

148
00:09:32,708 --> 00:09:34,208
We can do this!

149
00:09:34,875 --> 00:09:36,666
Seriously, what's
your deal, Trudy?

150
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:38,708
You act like
you're scared to fight.

151
00:09:38,791 --> 00:09:40,166
You know I'd fight
the Neuroi by myself

152
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:42,875
if I had to and
I'm not afraid to die.

153
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:45,125
You'll never
have to fight alone!

154
00:09:47,125 --> 00:09:50,250
We are the Strike Witches...
In case you forgot.

155
00:09:50,333 --> 00:09:53,750
Yeah! With all eleven of us,
I know we can win!

156
00:09:59,791 --> 00:10:01,500
All eleven of us...

157
00:10:15,666 --> 00:10:17,500
I wonder what was wrong...

158
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:19,666
The Major seemed distracted.

159
00:10:21,083 --> 00:10:24,166
The marks from the Reppumaru
still haven't gone away...

160
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:26,041
They could be permanent.

161
00:10:27,125 --> 00:10:28,791
Sakamoto...?

162
00:10:28,875 --> 00:10:32,250
Hey, Major Sakamoto,
are you still awake?

163
00:10:34,416 --> 00:10:36,375
I need to talk to you...

164
00:10:58,166 --> 00:10:59,458
It's now or never.

165
00:10:59,541 --> 00:11:01,791
I have to master the
Shin-Reppuzan tonight,

166
00:11:01,875 --> 00:11:03,416
or die trying.

167
00:11:05,875 --> 00:11:07,208
Come on!

168
00:11:22,625 --> 00:11:25,000
Minna... How did you know?

169
00:11:25,083 --> 00:11:28,333
I knew it was only a matter
of time before this happened.

170
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,291
I see...

171
00:11:31,375 --> 00:11:34,000
It truly is a
double-edged sword.

172
00:11:34,083 --> 00:11:35,375
The supernatural blade gives you

173
00:11:35,458 --> 00:11:37,583
incredible strength
on the battlefield,

174
00:11:37,666 --> 00:11:39,375
but the price you pay

175
00:11:39,458 --> 00:11:42,166
is how much of your
magic energy it consumes.

176
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:43,375
I'm sorry...

177
00:11:43,458 --> 00:11:45,541
You don't have much
time left as a Witch...

178
00:11:45,625 --> 00:11:47,791
The Reppumaru has
taken that from you.

179
00:11:47,875 --> 00:11:50,916
Well that doesn't mean
I'm done fighting!

180
00:11:57,125 --> 00:11:58,916
You have to stop... Mio.

181
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,333
You know I can't...
The Reppuzan...!

182
00:12:01,416 --> 00:12:04,041
If I don't master it, then
all of this was for nothing!

183
00:12:04,125 --> 00:12:05,958
Let it go...
Don't you understand...?

184
00:12:06,041 --> 00:12:07,541
You can't do it now!

185
00:12:07,625 --> 00:12:11,500
All I have is this battle...!
One hit is all I need!

186
00:12:11,583 --> 00:12:15,458
Please... let me
unleash the Shin-Reppuzan!

187
00:12:17,583 --> 00:12:20,791
I'm begging you...
as your friend...

188
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:25,041
When that battle starts
let me go out as I choose!

189
00:12:25,875 --> 00:12:28,875
Minna... You have to...

190
00:12:35,166 --> 00:12:36,541
Mio...

191
00:12:49,541 --> 00:12:52,708
It can't be...
that's the Major...

192
00:12:56,541 --> 00:12:57,541
These are your orders...

193
00:12:57,625 --> 00:12:59,166
The 501st Joint Fighter Wing

194
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:01,708
will now take part
in Operation Mars.

195
00:13:02,875 --> 00:13:05,250
We're going to wipe
the Neuroi off the map.

196
00:13:05,333 --> 00:13:07,125
Our battle assignment,
at all costs,

197
00:13:07,208 --> 00:13:10,833
is to protect the flagship of
the Allied fleet, the Yamato.

198
00:13:10,916 --> 00:13:12,458
Now! Let's get going!

199
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:13,875
Yes, ma'am!

200
00:13:25,333 --> 00:13:27,708
We have to fight like
we never have before.

201
00:13:29,333 --> 00:13:32,333
All right... I'm gonna do
this for Major Sakamoto...

202
00:13:32,416 --> 00:13:36,083
because every kill I make is one
she won't have to worry about.

203
00:13:52,541 --> 00:13:54,000
Witches at seven o'clock!

204
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:55,750
The Strike Witches. Finally!

205
00:14:00,208 --> 00:14:01,750
So this is the Yamato?

206
00:14:01,833 --> 00:14:03,750
It's frikkin' huge!

207
00:14:07,333 --> 00:14:08,541
There it is.

208
00:14:08,625 --> 00:14:09,458
Roger...

209
00:14:09,541 --> 00:14:11,291
I guess that's it...

210
00:14:11,375 --> 00:14:18,916
Yoshika, look.

211
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,708
That whole thing
is a Neuroi hive...?

212
00:14:20,791 --> 00:14:21,916
That's right.

213
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,333
It's their main command
and control center.

214
00:14:37,375 --> 00:14:38,666
Approaching Venezia...

215
00:14:39,625 --> 00:14:42,291
Entering the Neuroi
defense perimeter... now.

216
00:14:42,375 --> 00:14:44,875
Three minutes to
Yamato-Neuroi transformation!

217
00:14:46,833 --> 00:14:48,291
USS Nicholas has been hit!

218
00:14:48,375 --> 00:14:50,541
All hands... battle stations!

219
00:14:54,708 --> 00:14:56,000
This is it!

220
00:14:56,083 --> 00:14:58,000
We have to protect the
Yamato until it transforms!

221
00:14:58,083 --> 00:14:59,041
Is that understood?

222
00:14:59,125 --> 00:15:00,458
Yes, ma'am!

223
00:15:10,916 --> 00:15:11,750
You all right?!

224
00:15:11,833 --> 00:15:13,750
I'm fine.

225
00:15:15,625 --> 00:15:17,875
They're focusing their
attack on the Yamato!

226
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:20,708
Damn! They must have realized
the Yamato isn't normal!

227
00:15:21,458 --> 00:15:22,916
Hey! You comin'!

228
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,250
Heck yeah.

229
00:15:33,416 --> 00:15:34,625
That's how we do it!

230
00:15:34,708 --> 00:15:37,375
I'm right over here, losers!
Come and get me!

231
00:15:38,541 --> 00:15:39,625
Now, Sanya!

232
00:15:39,708 --> 00:15:40,875
Right!

233
00:15:44,083 --> 00:15:45,791
I was only trying to hit one...

234
00:15:45,875 --> 00:15:48,208
Way to save on ammo, Sanya!

235
00:15:51,541 --> 00:15:53,166
It looks like they're
coming from everywhere.

236
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:54,875
Would you shut up
and start shooting!

237
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:56,833
They're not going to give you a
medal for running your mouth.

238
00:15:56,916 --> 00:15:59,208
As if I care about
getting a medal.

239
00:16:03,458 --> 00:16:04,708
Damn! There's no end to 'em!

240
00:16:04,791 --> 00:16:06,416
Get outta my city, jerkhats!

241
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,625
Is your shield going
to keep holding?

242
00:16:08,708 --> 00:16:11,375
Yeah... I've got it.

243
00:16:11,458 --> 00:16:12,375
I can do this.

244
00:16:12,458 --> 00:16:14,125
The Major needs my help.

245
00:16:17,666 --> 00:16:19,208
Hey, how are you holding up?

246
00:16:19,291 --> 00:16:20,375
This is a walk in the park...

247
00:16:20,458 --> 00:16:22,208
Everyone else is
giving it their all...

248
00:16:22,291 --> 00:16:24,500
So, why should I do any less?

249
00:16:28,375 --> 00:16:30,583
Target all Neuroi with
the main gun batteries.

250
00:16:30,666 --> 00:16:32,791
All ships, fire at will!

251
00:16:46,083 --> 00:16:47,333
We're surrounded!

252
00:16:47,708 --> 00:16:49,333
Lynne! Perrine! Hang on!

253
00:16:49,833 --> 00:16:51,625
No, you don't!

254
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:53,041
Major!

255
00:16:53,125 --> 00:16:53,875
Mio!

256
00:16:53,958 --> 00:16:57,291
Reppuzan!

257
00:17:13,125 --> 00:17:14,916
Major, did you get injured?

258
00:17:18,458 --> 00:17:19,666
My magic...

259
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:23,666
The Reppuzan... It's all gone...

260
00:17:27,458 --> 00:17:29,333
Target acquired at
eleven thousand feet...

261
00:17:29,416 --> 00:17:32,083
The Yamato has thirty seconds
'til Neuroi transformation.

262
00:17:32,166 --> 00:17:34,166
Magic Dynamo is
primed and ready.

263
00:17:35,958 --> 00:17:37,333
Let's show these alien bastards

264
00:17:37,416 --> 00:17:39,750
what we're capable of when
there are no other options.

265
00:17:39,833 --> 00:17:43,083
20 seconds left... 19... 18...

266
00:17:43,166 --> 00:17:44,375
Oh yeah!

267
00:17:46,875 --> 00:17:48,541
Stay with me, girl... Come on!

268
00:17:48,625 --> 00:17:50,208
I'm just getting started!

269
00:17:50,291 --> 00:17:52,000
It's not all about
you, ya know...

270
00:17:52,541 --> 00:17:54,166
You're quiet. Everything okay?

271
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:55,750
I think so.

272
00:17:57,583 --> 00:17:58,875
Everyone low on magic energy,

273
00:17:58,958 --> 00:18:01,666
fall back to the
Aircraft Carrier Amagi.

274
00:18:03,625 --> 00:18:07,916
I can't even raise my sword
to fight... out here...

275
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:09,750
I'm useless to them.

276
00:18:10,708 --> 00:18:15,458
4... 3... 2... 1... 0...

277
00:18:15,541 --> 00:18:18,375
Activating Core
Control System Beta...

278
00:18:18,875 --> 00:18:20,625
Magic Dynamo engaged.

279
00:18:35,291 --> 00:18:36,333
Is this it?

280
00:18:36,416 --> 00:18:37,833
I guess so.

281
00:18:37,916 --> 00:18:39,166
Eila look...

282
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:42,166
I know... I can't believe
it's really changing.

283
00:18:51,125 --> 00:18:53,458
Yamato transformation complete.

284
00:18:53,541 --> 00:18:55,541
The clock is set at
nine minutes... mark.

285
00:18:55,625 --> 00:18:57,458
All right... let's go.

286
00:19:32,375 --> 00:19:34,125
A flying ship...?! No way!

287
00:19:35,875 --> 00:19:38,375
All systems are
responding normally, Sir.

288
00:19:38,458 --> 00:19:39,791
It worked.

289
00:19:41,458 --> 00:19:43,416
Wow. Awesome.

290
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,083
Sanya, are you seeing this?

291
00:19:45,166 --> 00:19:47,000
It's hard to miss.

292
00:19:47,083 --> 00:19:48,875
Captain, we are locked
on to the Neuroi Hive,

293
00:19:48,958 --> 00:19:50,541
and the glide path is clear.

294
00:19:50,625 --> 00:19:52,375
Maintain our present course.

295
00:19:52,458 --> 00:19:54,291
Full battle speed!

296
00:19:55,375 --> 00:19:56,375
Mission complete!

297
00:19:56,458 --> 00:19:58,750
All Witches rendezvous
at the Amagi.

298
00:20:02,583 --> 00:20:04,541
Major... We
accomplished everything

299
00:20:04,625 --> 00:20:06,708
we were asked to do today.

300
00:20:06,791 --> 00:20:08,666
But I can't fight...

301
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:11,041
It's the only thing
I was ever any good at...

302
00:20:11,125 --> 00:20:15,000
But now... my shield is gone...

303
00:20:15,083 --> 00:20:17,041
and I've lost the Reppuzan.

304
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:21,625
You've fought enough
battles for one person.

305
00:20:26,541 --> 00:20:27,583
Thank goodness!

306
00:20:27,666 --> 00:20:30,208
Now Major Sakamoto
won't have to fight!

307
00:20:44,333 --> 00:20:46,750
At this rate, the Yamato
will be destroyed!

308
00:20:46,833 --> 00:20:49,208
No, it's a Neuroi.
It's regenerating.

309
00:20:49,291 --> 00:20:53,208
Of course. Why didn't
I see it before?

310
00:20:53,291 --> 00:20:56,166
I told you, as a Neuroi,
the Yamato is invincible!

311
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:58,416
One thousand feet
to target and closing.

312
00:21:05,833 --> 00:21:07,166
Five hundred...

313
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:08,666
Its firepower's huge.

314
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:10,041
Three hundred...

315
00:21:12,833 --> 00:21:14,375
Ramming speed!

316
00:21:20,666 --> 00:21:23,125
Fire the main
forward cannons now!

317
00:21:23,208 --> 00:21:24,125
Fire cannons!

318
00:21:24,208 --> 00:21:26,000
End of the line, Neroi.

319
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:37,666
Wait... why isn't
the Yamato firing?

320
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:38,625
I knew it...

321
00:21:38,708 --> 00:21:40,000
Captain!

322
00:21:40,083 --> 00:21:41,708
The Yamato's weapons control
system won't respond!

323
00:21:41,791 --> 00:21:43,000
That can't be.

324
00:21:43,083 --> 00:21:44,750
The Magic Dynamo has shut down!

325
00:21:44,833 --> 00:21:45,750
It's no use...

326
00:21:45,833 --> 00:21:47,458
The main cannons
will not respond!

327
00:21:47,541 --> 00:21:49,625
No! This can't be happening!

328
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:07,500
What now?

329
00:22:07,583 --> 00:22:11,208
We're finished...
This is how it ends.

330
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:14,500
You have all fought
with honor today...

331
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:17,750
but I'm afraid the Yamato's
Dynamo is offline...

332
00:22:17,833 --> 00:22:20,166
The main cannons are inoperable.

333
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:22,916
Our final mission against
the Neuroi has failed.

334
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,166
Failed?!

335
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:26,583
Oh, no... We've lost?!

336
00:22:27,041 --> 00:22:27,875
That can't be!

337
00:22:27,958 --> 00:22:29,625
No frikkin way!

338
00:22:31,291 --> 00:22:32,500
Does the Major know?

339
00:22:32,583 --> 00:22:35,125
All ships, hard to port!

340
00:22:35,208 --> 00:22:37,041
Withdraw immediately!

341
00:22:38,083 --> 00:22:39,416
Not yet!

342
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:40,750
This isn't over!

343
00:22:40,833 --> 00:22:43,416
I've still got strength left...

344
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:46,333
This fight's not done,
and neither am I!

345
00:22:46,916 --> 00:22:47,708
Mio, no!

346
00:22:47,791 --> 00:22:49,291
I'm going to board the Yamato.

347
00:22:49,375 --> 00:22:51,208
I have just enough
magic power left...

348
00:22:51,291 --> 00:22:52,833
to restart the Dynamo!

349
00:22:52,916 --> 00:22:54,041
No, Mio!

350
00:22:54,125 --> 00:22:56,208
No! Come back!

351
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:32,000
Our dreams are still
far from coming true,

352
00:24:32,083 --> 00:24:35,958
but if we all work together
I know we can make it happen!

353
00:24:36,041 --> 00:24:37,458
Almost there!

354
00:24:37,541 --> 00:24:41,291
On the final Strike Witches 2:
"Beyond the Eternal Sky."
