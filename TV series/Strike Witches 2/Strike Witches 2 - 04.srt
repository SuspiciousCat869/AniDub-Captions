1
00:00:54,625 --> 00:00:57,416
My Merlin Engine's working
perfectly yet again today...!

2
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:59,666
Who's a good
little Striker unit?

3
00:01:00,083 --> 00:01:01,916
Captain Charlotte Yeager!

4
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:06,125
Just what are you
doing dressed like that?!

5
00:01:06,208 --> 00:01:09,250
Isn't it obvious...?
I'm testing an engine.

6
00:01:09,333 --> 00:01:10,791
You know that's
not what I meant;

7
00:01:10,875 --> 00:01:12,375
we're at combat readiness...

8
00:01:12,458 --> 00:01:14,916
What would you do if a
Neuroi showed up right now?

9
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,416
Okay, I get it...

10
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:19,625
The hanger just gets so hot
whenever we run our engines.

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,166
Look! It's not just me!

12
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:22,666
So hot...

13
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:25,666
You two are ridiculous...
Do you ever act professional?

14
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:28,333
Aw... So what,
I'm supposed to believe

15
00:01:28,416 --> 00:01:30,375
Karlslanders follow
all the rules...?

16
00:01:30,458 --> 00:01:32,416
That's not true,
is it, Hartmann?

17
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:34,250
It's so hot...

18
00:01:34,333 --> 00:01:36,500
Hey...! Hartmann!
You can't be serious!

19
00:01:36,583 --> 00:01:39,500
How can you call yourself
a Karlsland soldier?!

20
00:01:39,583 --> 00:01:42,500
Uh... I use my words.

21
00:01:43,166 --> 00:01:44,750
It's true...

22
00:03:23,208 --> 00:03:26,625
So... this is the latest
model from Karlsland.

23
00:03:26,708 --> 00:03:28,625
Technically it's
just a prototype...

24
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:32,541
It's called the
ME262 V1 Jet Striker.

25
00:03:32,625 --> 00:03:33,833
Jet Striker?

26
00:03:33,916 --> 00:03:35,291
Oh, when did you get here?

27
00:03:35,375 --> 00:03:37,125
And why are you
dressed like that?

28
00:03:37,208 --> 00:03:38,500
Seriously Hartmann!

29
00:03:38,583 --> 00:03:41,500
Would you put some clothes on?

30
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:43,291
What's that?

31
00:03:43,375 --> 00:03:45,125
They call it a "Jet Striker."

32
00:03:45,208 --> 00:03:46,458
Jet...?

33
00:03:46,541 --> 00:03:47,833
You mean like the kind
that was being researched?

34
00:03:48,916 --> 00:03:50,041
It arrived here

35
00:03:50,125 --> 00:03:51,875
from Neue Karlsland
earlier this morning...

36
00:03:51,958 --> 00:03:53,708
Its engine output is
several times greater

37
00:03:53,791 --> 00:03:55,291
than a Reciprocating...

38
00:03:55,375 --> 00:03:59,916
with a top speed of over nine
hundred fifty kph. Impressive.

39
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,458
Nine hundred fifty?!
Hello, lover!

40
00:04:02,541 --> 00:04:05,000
It's next gen technology

41
00:04:05,083 --> 00:04:07,208
that will replace our
Reciprocating Strikers.

42
00:04:07,291 --> 00:04:10,166
Shirley... Why are you
dressed like that, too?

43
00:04:14,416 --> 00:04:15,875
What is this?

44
00:04:15,958 --> 00:04:19,083
That is an armament designed
specifically for Jet Strikers.

45
00:04:19,166 --> 00:04:21,375
It's a fifty-millimeter cannon.

46
00:04:21,458 --> 00:04:24,666
And it comes with four
thirty-millimeter machine guns?

47
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:26,000
Awesome!

48
00:04:26,083 --> 00:04:28,125
Is it possible to fly
carrying all that weight?

49
00:04:28,208 --> 00:04:29,291
Hey, you guys!

50
00:04:29,375 --> 00:04:31,541
I wanna try it on.
Please, can I try it on?

51
00:04:31,625 --> 00:04:33,416
No way...! I'll wear it.

52
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:36,083
Why? It's not like
it belongs to you.

53
00:04:36,166 --> 00:04:38,166
Whatever! This unit
was built in Karlsland!

54
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:40,166
I should be the one
to wear it, end of story.

55
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:42,250
Don't you 'end of story' me...!

56
00:04:42,333 --> 00:04:44,041
I don't care where it's from...

57
00:04:44,125 --> 00:04:45,708
I'm the one who knows about

58
00:04:45,791 --> 00:04:47,458
that little thing called
the sound barrier.

59
00:04:47,541 --> 00:04:49,000
Of course!

60
00:04:49,083 --> 00:04:50,875
Because speed is the only
thing you can ever think about!

61
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:52,458
Well, your face is the only
thing you can ever think about!

62
00:04:52,541 --> 00:04:53,875
And here we go again.

63
00:04:53,958 --> 00:04:54,541
Those girls will never learn.

64
00:04:54,625 --> 00:04:56,291
Hey! Me first!

65
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:58,500
Hold on! What the--

66
00:04:58,583 --> 00:05:00,208
So not fair, Francesca!

67
00:05:00,291 --> 00:05:04,875
Sorry! Okay, I'm really
not that sorry. See ya!

68
00:05:19,708 --> 00:05:21,208
Francesca!

69
00:05:22,125 --> 00:05:24,708
What's wrong...
Are you hurt or something?

70
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:27,208
It made a buzzing noise,
like "buuuzz".

71
00:05:27,291 --> 00:05:28,166
It went buzz?

72
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:30,375
I hate buzzing.

73
00:05:30,458 --> 00:05:32,500
Shirley... Don't wear it.

74
00:05:34,541 --> 00:05:37,125
Yeah, so, uh... you go ahead.

75
00:05:37,208 --> 00:05:38,041
How come?

76
00:05:38,125 --> 00:05:39,375
After thinking about it,

77
00:05:39,458 --> 00:05:40,416
I realize there's a lot

78
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,541
of potential left in
Reciprocators...

79
00:05:42,625 --> 00:05:45,791
I can always try
those 'jetsy' ones later.

80
00:05:45,875 --> 00:05:49,500
Afraid you can't handle it?
Well, I'm not.

81
00:05:49,583 --> 00:05:51,125
Let's go!

82
00:05:57,833 --> 00:05:58,916
Wow.

83
00:06:01,333 --> 00:06:02,250
Whaddaya say?

84
00:06:02,333 --> 00:06:03,458
Because I don't think any

85
00:06:03,541 --> 00:06:05,333
of our Reciprocating
Strikers can beat this!

86
00:06:05,416 --> 00:06:06,791
Oh, whatever!

87
00:06:06,875 --> 00:06:07,833
Here you are...!

88
00:06:07,916 --> 00:06:09,625
Come over and get it, everybody!

89
00:06:09,708 --> 00:06:13,000
She's trying to say
breakfast is ready!

90
00:06:13,083 --> 00:06:14,250
Hello?

91
00:06:14,333 --> 00:06:15,916
Why don't you quit
screwing around for once?

92
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,458
I swear, you're
like a three-year-old

93
00:06:17,541 --> 00:06:18,958
with a stupid new toy.

94
00:06:19,041 --> 00:06:21,541
Someone's jealous...
You're such a disgrace.

95
00:06:21,625 --> 00:06:23,083
Yeah, just like your face...

96
00:06:23,166 --> 00:06:25,208
I can change my mind... right?

97
00:06:25,291 --> 00:06:27,083
Do you know how
selfish you sound?

98
00:06:27,166 --> 00:06:28,166
Do you know you sound like

99
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:29,666
you got a stick up your
you-know-what?!

100
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:31,750
Oh... They're at it again.

101
00:06:46,208 --> 00:06:48,166
So, what's all this
excitement about, girls?

102
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:49,750
It seems Barkhorn
and Shirley are mad

103
00:06:49,833 --> 00:06:51,750
at each other again
for some reason.

104
00:06:51,833 --> 00:06:53,958
They're competing to see
who can climb higher...!

105
00:06:54,041 --> 00:06:55,875
Go,... Shirley!

106
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:06,833
It appears Shirley has stopped

107
00:07:06,916 --> 00:07:09,333
at approximately
twelve thousand meters.

108
00:07:09,666 --> 00:07:13,291
Captain Barkhorn is still
climbing, though... Goodness!

109
00:07:13,375 --> 00:07:14,666
Yeah...

110
00:07:16,458 --> 00:07:17,583
Yoink!

111
00:07:17,666 --> 00:07:20,625
Hey, I win! Ha-ha!

112
00:07:21,333 --> 00:07:24,583
Right... Bitter much, Shirley?
You are so transparent.

113
00:07:25,291 --> 00:07:27,291
Ah! Yummy!

114
00:07:27,375 --> 00:07:29,500
It's okay...!
You'll get her next time!

115
00:07:29,583 --> 00:07:32,625
Uh, yeah...!
I'm the sound breaker.

116
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:39,500
Do you think you'll
be able to fly?

117
00:07:39,583 --> 00:07:41,291
I mean, carrying all that stuff?

118
00:07:41,375 --> 00:07:44,750
Don't worry about me;
my P--51 is a super star...!

119
00:07:44,833 --> 00:07:47,458
This baby can handle pretty
much anything you throw at it,

120
00:07:47,541 --> 00:07:48,708
so I'm good!

121
00:07:48,791 --> 00:07:50,041
What's the competition now?

122
00:07:50,125 --> 00:07:52,333
They said it's a
payload contest...

123
00:07:52,416 --> 00:07:54,875
They're gonna see how much
weight their Strikers can carry.

124
00:07:54,958 --> 00:07:56,791
Then Shirley's at a
disadvantage...

125
00:07:56,875 --> 00:07:58,125
All that extra
weight on her chest

126
00:07:58,208 --> 00:08:00,041
will certainly be
working against her.

127
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,416
Sorry about the wait.

128
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:09,375
Are you sure you can carry
that much, Captain Barkhorn?

129
00:08:09,458 --> 00:08:11,583
Yep... Not a problem.

130
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:13,291
Oh, come on!

131
00:08:13,375 --> 00:08:14,875
There is no way you're
gonna be able to fly like that!

132
00:08:22,041 --> 00:08:23,458
What the crap?

133
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:26,125
Target confirmed!

134
00:08:34,791 --> 00:08:37,625
This is amazing! The Jet
Striker is unbelievable!

135
00:08:41,875 --> 00:08:43,750
No freakin' way.

136
00:08:44,291 --> 00:08:46,666
We're having meat and
potato stew for dinner.

137
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:48,958
Yum...! There's only
one thing in this world

138
00:08:49,041 --> 00:08:50,541
that I know about cooking...

139
00:08:50,625 --> 00:08:53,666
And that's everything you
make tastes wonderful...

140
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:55,166
Is this base fish stock?

141
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:59,500
It is...! Bonito,
specifically! Thank you!

142
00:08:59,583 --> 00:09:01,416
I still don't understand
why we're being forced

143
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:04,208
to eat in a dirty place
that smells of motor oil.

144
00:09:04,291 --> 00:09:06,500
If you're complaining,
you're not eating.

145
00:09:06,583 --> 00:09:07,541
So good!

146
00:09:07,625 --> 00:09:09,125
We're only eating in the hangar

147
00:09:09,208 --> 00:09:12,041
because Yoshika is worried about
Captain Barkhorn and Shirley.

148
00:09:12,125 --> 00:09:15,708
Yeah, it's true. I'm just
trying to do what I can...

149
00:09:15,791 --> 00:09:17,083
You know what they say...

150
00:09:17,166 --> 00:09:19,625
an empty stomach
can make you irritable.

151
00:09:19,708 --> 00:09:21,166
Who says that?

152
00:09:21,833 --> 00:09:23,500
Captain... Here's some food.

153
00:09:23,583 --> 00:09:26,791
I bet you're starving,
aren't you?

154
00:09:26,875 --> 00:09:28,041
Yeah, I am...

155
00:09:28,125 --> 00:09:29,833
You can leave it right there...

156
00:09:29,916 --> 00:09:32,916
Thank you... I just
need to rest a bit first.

157
00:09:38,166 --> 00:09:41,750
This is always such a good idea!

158
00:09:41,833 --> 00:09:43,375
Genius, if you ask me!

159
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:45,500
Apparently, Major Sakamoto
used these drums

160
00:09:45,583 --> 00:09:48,000
a lot when she was in Libau.

161
00:09:51,083 --> 00:09:52,583
Francesca! What are you doing?!

162
00:09:53,375 --> 00:09:55,208
 Stop!

163
00:09:55,875 --> 00:09:57,541
We haven't taken a
bath together in forever!

164
00:09:57,625 --> 00:10:00,708
Sorry, girls, but I fill
this one up all by myself.

165
00:10:02,125 --> 00:10:04,583
I wish Captain Barkhorn
would've come with us, too.

166
00:10:04,666 --> 00:10:06,291
Can we not mention her?

167
00:10:06,375 --> 00:10:08,291
I'm sorry; she just
seemed even more tired

168
00:10:08,375 --> 00:10:10,125
than she normally does today.

169
00:10:10,208 --> 00:10:11,958
I bet it's the
jet thingie's fault.

170
00:10:12,041 --> 00:10:12,958
The what thingie?

171
00:10:13,041 --> 00:10:15,291
You know, it goes 'buzz'!

172
00:10:15,375 --> 00:10:17,750
Ow...! Wait, are you talking
about the Jet Striker?

173
00:10:17,833 --> 00:10:20,041
That's what I said!

174
00:10:42,583 --> 00:10:45,166
Ready? Bang!

175
00:10:47,375 --> 00:10:48,125
Barkhorn!

176
00:10:48,208 --> 00:10:51,250
Didn't you hear me...? Bang!

177
00:10:52,083 --> 00:10:54,916
Bang means go, so go!

178
00:11:08,916 --> 00:11:10,666
Incredible!
It feels like an angel

179
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:12,875
is giving me an extra push!

180
00:11:12,958 --> 00:11:17,250
No way...! I can't believe that
stupid thing is faster than me!

181
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:18,875
Oh no!

182
00:11:25,333 --> 00:11:26,916
She crashed!

183
00:11:40,625 --> 00:11:41,500
She's awake.

184
00:11:41,583 --> 00:11:43,125
What's wrong with you guys...?

185
00:11:43,208 --> 00:11:45,666
You're all looking at me like
there's something on my face.

186
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:47,958
Captain Barkhorn! You're okay!

187
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:49,625
You fell into the sea, Trudy.

188
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:52,791
What do you mean...?
I don't understand.

189
00:11:52,875 --> 00:11:55,916
You passed out after
using up all your magic...

190
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,333
That's when you crashed...
Do you not remember?

191
00:11:58,416 --> 00:12:01,125
No! You're talking
about a basic mistake.

192
00:12:01,208 --> 00:12:02,500
I'd never do that!

193
00:12:02,583 --> 00:12:04,083
No one is blaming you...

194
00:12:04,166 --> 00:12:07,625
We're assuming the problem has
to be with the Jet Striker Unit.

195
00:12:07,708 --> 00:12:09,375
I'm still not one
hundred percent sure...

196
00:12:09,458 --> 00:12:11,375
but it appears it consumed
a tremendous amount

197
00:12:11,458 --> 00:12:13,416
of your magic energy.

198
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,875
Prototypes always come
with problems though...

199
00:12:15,958 --> 00:12:18,833
That Jet Striker unit
is incredible.

200
00:12:18,916 --> 00:12:20,833
We need to keep
testing it even more,

201
00:12:20,916 --> 00:12:22,916
so we can deploy
them in the field.

202
00:12:23,541 --> 00:12:25,000
I'm sorry...

203
00:12:25,083 --> 00:12:27,791
But I won't place you or anyone
else in that kind of danger.

204
00:12:27,875 --> 00:12:29,375
Sorry, Captain Barkhorn...

205
00:12:29,458 --> 00:12:32,666
but, I am henceforth grounding
you... effective immediately...

206
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:34,416
You will remain confined
to your quarters.

207
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:35,458
Minna!

208
00:12:35,541 --> 00:12:37,083
That's an order.

209
00:12:40,708 --> 00:12:42,875
Yes, ma'am.

210
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:46,291
As of this moment...
the Jet Striker is forbidden.

211
00:13:14,416 --> 00:13:16,333
Captain Barkhorn, um...

212
00:13:16,416 --> 00:13:18,083
Why are you hanging like that?

213
00:13:18,166 --> 00:13:22,541
I'm training.
What does it look like?

214
00:13:23,125 --> 00:13:25,166
It wasn't the
Jet Striker's fault I fell...

215
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:28,833
I just wasn't strong enough,
which won't happen again.

216
00:13:28,916 --> 00:13:30,958
You're not planning on
flying that thing, are you?

217
00:13:31,041 --> 00:13:33,750
Naturally... If we can
master those Strikers,

218
00:13:33,833 --> 00:13:36,958
imagine how much we can
change the course of this war.

219
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:41,833
Give it up... It won't happen.

220
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:43,958
Shirley!

221
00:13:44,041 --> 00:13:45,083
Whadda you want...?

222
00:13:45,166 --> 00:13:47,333
You here to laugh at me...?
Of course.

223
00:13:47,416 --> 00:13:49,791
I ran out of magic and
looked like a rookie...

224
00:13:49,875 --> 00:13:52,041
I bet you just loved that.

225
00:13:52,125 --> 00:13:54,208
I didn't love anything
about what happened...

226
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:56,291
That Striker is
dangerous--period...

227
00:13:56,375 --> 00:13:59,125
You fly it again, you'll
wind up worse than grounded.

228
00:13:59,208 --> 00:14:01,208
That may or may not be true...

229
00:14:01,291 --> 00:14:03,041
But you have to
admit Jet Strikers

230
00:14:03,125 --> 00:14:06,166
would offer us extraordinary
fighting potential...

231
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:08,958
In my opinion,
it's worth the risk.

232
00:14:09,041 --> 00:14:11,750
So it's worth it
if it kills you?

233
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:14,625
That won't happen...
Think about it...

234
00:14:14,708 --> 00:14:17,125
Why do you figure I'm
trying to get stronger?

235
00:14:20,291 --> 00:14:22,000
You're beyond stubborn!

236
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:29,500
Sounds like there's a Neuroi.

237
00:14:29,583 --> 00:14:30,583
Lieutenant Hartmann!

238
00:14:30,666 --> 00:14:32,458
When did you get here?

239
00:14:34,125 --> 00:14:35,583
I'm off!

240
00:14:38,208 --> 00:14:40,000
Wait for us Shirley!

241
00:14:40,083 --> 00:14:41,375
Yoshika, no!

242
00:14:41,458 --> 00:14:43,875
We're supposed to be on
standby in the command room.

243
00:14:59,375 --> 00:15:00,125
Surprise!

244
00:15:00,208 --> 00:15:01,125
Hartmann?

245
00:15:01,208 --> 00:15:03,583
Thought you might want that!

246
00:15:09,916 --> 00:15:11,583
An intercom?

247
00:15:12,833 --> 00:15:15,458
The target is currently
moving South toward Rome!

248
00:15:15,541 --> 00:15:18,208
And it appears to be
gradually accelerating.

249
00:15:19,291 --> 00:15:21,791
Correct accordingly
for engagement location!

250
00:15:21,875 --> 00:15:24,250
Yeah, we know...
I can see it now.

251
00:15:31,791 --> 00:15:33,250
It just broke apart!

252
00:15:33,333 --> 00:15:35,875
It must've divided to
increase its numbers.

253
00:15:35,958 --> 00:15:37,958
Five against five!
That's perfect.

254
00:15:38,041 --> 00:15:40,500
Okay. Girls, spread out
and shoot them down!

255
00:15:40,583 --> 00:15:42,041
Don't let them get past us!

256
00:15:42,125 --> 00:15:43,500
Understood!

257
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:45,458
Shirley!

258
00:15:45,541 --> 00:15:47,416
What is it, Major?!

259
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:49,125
The one in the
center has the core...

260
00:15:49,208 --> 00:15:50,583
It'll be faster than the others.

261
00:15:50,666 --> 00:15:52,791
I'm leaving it to you.

262
00:15:53,583 --> 00:15:55,166
Roger!

263
00:16:06,083 --> 00:16:07,375
There it is!

264
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:14,291
I gotcha!

265
00:16:21,375 --> 00:16:22,750
No way!

266
00:16:27,916 --> 00:16:31,208
What? You wanna fight?
Oh, I'll give you a fight!

267
00:16:43,458 --> 00:16:45,416
It's moving too fast!

268
00:16:47,125 --> 00:16:48,708
Damn it!

269
00:16:52,375 --> 00:16:53,416
Sakamoto here...

270
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:54,583
Shirley needs assistance,

271
00:16:54,666 --> 00:16:56,375
but the rest of us
have our hands full...

272
00:16:56,458 --> 00:16:58,250
Requesting immediate
reinforcements.

273
00:16:58,333 --> 00:17:00,916
Understood. Lynne
and Miyafuji--you're up!

274
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,333
Right!

275
00:17:12,625 --> 00:17:13,750
Captain Barkhorn!

276
00:17:13,833 --> 00:17:15,958
Your Strikers won't
get you there in time!

277
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:30,958
But you're disobeying orders!

278
00:17:31,041 --> 00:17:33,000
This is the only way
we can help her.

279
00:17:33,083 --> 00:17:34,375
I have to go, now.

280
00:17:34,458 --> 00:17:36,833
Your strength still
isn't back, though!

281
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,041
Trudy!

282
00:17:43,125 --> 00:17:44,500
I'm sorry, Minna!

283
00:17:44,583 --> 00:17:47,750
I didn't have a choice...
You can punish me later.

284
00:17:48,791 --> 00:17:49,833
You have five minutes!

285
00:17:49,916 --> 00:17:52,291
That's as long as I'll allow!

286
00:17:54,083 --> 00:17:56,041
That's more than enough time!

287
00:17:59,125 --> 00:18:00,458
Take this!

288
00:18:01,833 --> 00:18:03,541
No, it's jammed!

289
00:18:05,625 --> 00:18:06,833
It split again!

290
00:18:10,791 --> 00:18:12,458
I'm trapped... It's sneaky.

291
00:18:26,583 --> 00:18:27,958
Captain Barkhorn?!

292
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:37,166
That was amazing!

293
00:18:38,416 --> 00:18:40,916
Wait... Am I wrong or was
the Jet Striker forbidden...?

294
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,500
But... she...

295
00:18:42,583 --> 00:18:44,166
No, you're not wrong...

296
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:46,125
She's an idiot.

297
00:18:48,833 --> 00:18:50,125
Way to go, Barkhorn!

298
00:18:52,125 --> 00:18:54,083
Barkhorn?! Can you hear me?

299
00:18:54,958 --> 00:18:56,208
What's going on?

300
00:18:56,291 --> 00:18:58,708
She isn't slowing down,
and she's not responding!

301
00:18:58,791 --> 00:19:00,250
No!

302
00:19:00,333 --> 00:19:01,250
This isn't good...

303
00:19:01,333 --> 00:19:02,458
The Jet Striker
is out of control!

304
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:04,708
It'll consume every
last bit of her magic!

305
00:19:04,791 --> 00:19:06,125
Shirley, go!

306
00:19:06,208 --> 00:19:07,375
I'm on it!

307
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:31,708
Damn you!

308
00:19:37,666 --> 00:19:39,750
What's that sound?

309
00:19:43,166 --> 00:19:45,083
I got her!

310
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:12,416
My boobies!
My boobies! My boobies!

311
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:14,791
Get your face out of my rack!

312
00:20:27,833 --> 00:20:30,791
Why does everything exciting
happen while we're asleep?

313
00:20:30,875 --> 00:20:32,458
It's in pieces...

314
00:20:32,541 --> 00:20:33,750
I consider it a blessing.

315
00:20:33,833 --> 00:20:35,583
That thing was out of control.

316
00:20:35,666 --> 00:20:38,625
Yes. As was the
person who used it.

317
00:20:38,708 --> 00:20:42,041
Yeah, but she's the only
reason we beat that Neuroi;

318
00:20:42,125 --> 00:20:43,916
you could go a
little easier on her.

319
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,375
Rules are rules. Sorry.

320
00:20:47,041 --> 00:20:48,375
However, this is the first time

321
00:20:48,458 --> 00:20:51,833
she's disobeyed a
direct order, isn't it?

322
00:20:51,916 --> 00:20:54,125
I'm so sorry for all
the trouble, everyone.

323
00:20:54,208 --> 00:20:56,125
Huh? Why are you apologizing?

324
00:20:56,208 --> 00:20:58,583
This had nothing to
do with you, Hartmann.

325
00:20:58,666 --> 00:21:00,458
Oh, no... actually...

326
00:21:00,833 --> 00:21:04,916
Okay girls... We've got
food if you're hungry.

327
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,541
We just received
a lot of potatoes,

328
00:21:06,625 --> 00:21:09,583
so I tried to make a bunch of
different dishes out of them.

329
00:21:10,291 --> 00:21:12,583
Here you go, Hartmann.
These are fried!

330
00:21:12,666 --> 00:21:13,916
Oh, thank you.

331
00:21:14,458 --> 00:21:16,750
Wait... Have you
always worn glasses?

332
00:21:16,833 --> 00:21:18,833
Yes... I have.

333
00:21:18,916 --> 00:21:20,458
Ah, yummy!

334
00:21:20,541 --> 00:21:23,541
Oh, Hartmann, you can
have some if you want.

335
00:21:29,125 --> 00:21:31,416
Hello, Erica... Good to see you!

336
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:34,291
Ursula...! Hey, Sister!

337
00:21:34,375 --> 00:21:36,500
Sister?

338
00:21:36,583 --> 00:21:40,125
I'd like you to meet
Lieutenant Ursula Hartmann...

339
00:21:40,208 --> 00:21:43,625
Otherwise known as Lieutenant
Erica Hartmann's twin sister.

340
00:21:43,708 --> 00:21:45,541
Twin sister?

341
00:21:45,625 --> 00:21:49,166
She's a member of the staff
that developed the Jet Striker.

342
00:21:52,125 --> 00:21:53,416
I wanted to apologize...

343
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:55,291
Captain Barkhorn,
I'm sorry for any trouble

344
00:21:55,375 --> 00:21:56,625
we may have caused...

345
00:21:56,708 --> 00:21:59,000
And... please know that we
were completely unaware

346
00:21:59,083 --> 00:22:01,625
of the Jet Striker's
apparent fatal flaw.

347
00:22:01,708 --> 00:22:04,375
Oh, well, it was just
a prototype anyway...

348
00:22:04,458 --> 00:22:05,875
So, don't worry.

349
00:22:05,958 --> 00:22:09,208
I feel like I should apologize
to you for destroying it.

350
00:22:09,291 --> 00:22:10,333
Not at all.

351
00:22:10,416 --> 00:22:12,125
I'm just relieved
you're all right...

352
00:22:12,208 --> 00:22:14,875
I'll take the remains
back to our homeland.

353
00:22:14,958 --> 00:22:16,708
You came all the
way here to get that?

354
00:22:16,791 --> 00:22:19,875
Yes... Although
there's not much left...

355
00:22:19,958 --> 00:22:23,250
But I also brought potatoes
as an apology for the trouble.

356
00:22:23,666 --> 00:22:25,791
No... not more potatoes!

357
00:22:25,875 --> 00:22:30,083
Hey! That's my fry!
You better let go!

358
00:22:30,166 --> 00:22:33,833
No way! This is from a
Liberian recipe, so I'll eat it!

359
00:22:33,916 --> 00:22:35,416
I don't care where it's from.

360
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:38,333
I need to replenish my energy
if I wanna regain my strength.

361
00:22:38,416 --> 00:22:40,166
Come on. Admit you like it.

362
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:41,958
Well, it could be worse.

363
00:22:42,041 --> 00:22:43,791
Yeah, I guess your
face could be worse, too.

364
00:22:43,875 --> 00:22:44,833
Jeez...! We made so many!

365
00:22:44,916 --> 00:22:46,666
Why are they
fighting over only one?

366
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:47,833
That's their thing...

367
00:22:47,916 --> 00:22:51,125
It's what they do.
Don't worry about it.

368
00:24:29,625 --> 00:24:31,583
When it comes to
yummy Romagna food,

369
00:24:31,666 --> 00:24:35,375
there's ricetta, fettucine,
margherita, and acqua patsa...!

370
00:24:35,458 --> 00:24:38,166
But the best of all is
my Momma's zuppa!

371
00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:41,583
On the next Strike Witches Two:
"My Romagna"!
