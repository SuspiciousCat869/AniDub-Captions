1
00:00:20,041 --> 00:00:23,791
In 1944, the Gallia region
of Europe was captured

2
00:00:23,875 --> 00:00:29,833
by a strange alien enemy known
to humankind only as the Neuroi.

3
00:00:29,916 --> 00:00:32,291
However, thanks to
the courageous resolve

4
00:00:32,375 --> 00:00:36,291
of the 501st Joint Fighter Wing,
the enemy Neuroi

5
00:00:36,375 --> 00:00:40,666
were wiped out and Gallia
was saved from destruction.

6
00:00:43,541 --> 00:00:47,583
Nevertheless, the battle
was still far from over.

7
00:01:06,708 --> 00:01:08,125
Neuroi detected...

8
00:01:08,208 --> 00:01:09,583
It looks like the
humanoid type reported

9
00:01:09,666 --> 00:01:11,625
by the Five Hundred
and First last year.

10
00:01:11,708 --> 00:01:13,416
Visual confirmation here...

11
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,833
Initiating contact
plan Alpha Three.

12
00:01:15,916 --> 00:01:17,166
Understood.

13
00:01:24,083 --> 00:01:26,291
Attempting communication
with the Neuroi is risky,

14
00:01:26,375 --> 00:01:28,375
but vital to our survival.

15
00:01:28,458 --> 00:01:31,041
It may be our only
hope of ending this war...

16
00:01:31,125 --> 00:01:32,708
I have to try.

17
00:01:39,875 --> 00:01:42,083
That looked like a
Neuroi beam that hit it.

18
00:01:44,916 --> 00:01:46,458
What?! No!

19
00:01:48,458 --> 00:01:51,666
Seemingly out of nowhere,
a giant Hive appeared

20
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:54,666
in the skies over Venezia,
consuming the old nest

21
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:57,208
and enveloping Northern Romagna.

22
00:01:57,291 --> 00:01:59,625
The human race
was forced, once again,

23
00:01:59,708 --> 00:02:03,250
into a battle for survival
against the Neuroi.

24
00:02:03,791 --> 00:02:07,916
Takei to command... The mission
with the Neuroi has failed...

25
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,541
I repeat... Operation
Trajan... has failed...

26
00:03:48,041 --> 00:03:49,333
Commence attack!

27
00:04:42,916 --> 00:04:49,166
♪ To you... we owe...
our great... success... ♪

28
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:54,833
♪ and all... our hopes...
and dreams... ♪

29
00:04:55,666 --> 00:04:59,500
♪ These years... have
passed... too soon... ♪

30
00:04:59,583 --> 00:05:02,166
Next up to address our
newest group of graduates...

31
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:05,333
I present your Class
Representative, Yoshika.

32
00:05:05,416 --> 00:05:06,500
Sir.

33
00:05:13,166 --> 00:05:14,458
This is amazing!

34
00:05:14,541 --> 00:05:16,500
It's snowing cherry blossoms.

35
00:05:17,041 --> 00:05:18,916
Come on, Michiko!

36
00:05:20,541 --> 00:05:22,250
Hold on, Yoshika...

37
00:05:22,333 --> 00:05:24,791
Were you really serious
about not continuing school

38
00:05:24,875 --> 00:05:26,375
after we graduate?

39
00:05:27,708 --> 00:05:31,000
The family clinic will
be mine to run someday...

40
00:05:31,083 --> 00:05:34,416
The only thing I've ever
wanted to do is save lives.

41
00:05:37,541 --> 00:05:38,541
I guess that means this is

42
00:05:38,625 --> 00:05:40,666
our last time walking
home together...

43
00:05:41,875 --> 00:05:44,500
Hello, Michiko!

44
00:05:44,583 --> 00:05:47,166
Grandpa! Hey!

45
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:49,333
There's my girl...

46
00:05:52,666 --> 00:05:54,083
I got my letter.

47
00:05:54,166 --> 00:05:57,083
I start at the teacher's school
in Yokohama in the spring.

48
00:05:57,166 --> 00:05:59,416
Wow... That's so cool.

49
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,208
If you like books it is.

50
00:06:02,208 --> 00:06:04,125
My little peanut
always did love to study,

51
00:06:04,208 --> 00:06:06,041
ever since she was a rug rat.

52
00:06:06,125 --> 00:06:08,041
I can't believe you're
gonna be a teacher.

53
00:06:08,125 --> 00:06:09,666
You're the future doctor
who's going to have

54
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:11,500
her very own clinic to run.

55
00:06:11,583 --> 00:06:14,500
Yeah, that's right...
a doctor...

56
00:06:17,666 --> 00:06:19,250
Look, there's
one of our warships.

57
00:06:19,333 --> 00:06:22,000
Yeah... It's the
Battleship Yamato.

58
00:06:22,333 --> 00:06:25,416
Two hundred sixty three meters
long with a maximum power output

59
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:28,500
of one hundred and fifty--three
thousand horsepower.

60
00:06:28,583 --> 00:06:30,833
It's the flagship
of our Allied fleet.

61
00:06:30,916 --> 00:06:32,791
Just awesome!

62
00:06:32,875 --> 00:06:34,208
So big.

63
00:06:34,291 --> 00:06:35,708
I think I read
something in the paper

64
00:06:35,791 --> 00:06:39,166
about its next assignment
being in the Mediterranean Sea.

65
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:41,333
Europe, huh...?

66
00:06:42,125 --> 00:06:44,833
That ship is actually
going to Europe...?

67
00:06:50,833 --> 00:06:52,416
What's going on Grandpa?

68
00:06:56,458 --> 00:06:57,625
It's a bear.

69
00:06:57,708 --> 00:07:00,083
What's a bear cub
doing this close to town?

70
00:07:00,166 --> 00:07:02,625
It's injured... That's so sad.

71
00:07:03,416 --> 00:07:04,750
Yoshika!

72
00:07:05,291 --> 00:07:08,125
You girls come back!
It's too dangerous.

73
00:07:10,166 --> 00:07:13,250
It's okay... You're gonna
be feeling a lot better soon.

74
00:07:24,375 --> 00:07:25,833
Hurry up and save him, okay?

75
00:07:37,583 --> 00:07:39,875
Step away!
That must be its mother.

76
00:07:39,958 --> 00:07:42,291
Get out of there! Run.

77
00:07:45,541 --> 00:07:49,750
Not yet... I'm not done.
Just a little more.

78
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,875
There... You're feeling
all better now, aren't you?

79
00:08:18,416 --> 00:08:20,083
She's really something...

80
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:21,750
Yoshika...

81
00:08:22,416 --> 00:08:24,500
I can't believe you did that.

82
00:08:26,541 --> 00:08:28,000
What's going on?

83
00:08:31,208 --> 00:08:33,000
Wow, that was scary.

84
00:08:44,791 --> 00:08:48,708
Hey, Dad... I graduated
from junior high school today.

85
00:08:48,791 --> 00:08:52,541
It's time for me to make good
on that promise I made to you.

86
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,125
The clinic will be my
life and I'll give my gift

87
00:08:55,208 --> 00:08:58,500
to everyone who needs it...
all in honor of you.

88
00:09:00,583 --> 00:09:02,541
Major Sakamoto...

89
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:04,083
I can't believe
it's been six months

90
00:09:04,166 --> 00:09:06,458
since the battle
for Britannia ended.

91
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:20,416
It all started with just
this letter, didn't it?

92
00:09:21,083 --> 00:09:23,208
Yoshika, I need your help.

93
00:09:23,291 --> 00:09:25,541
Michiko, What happened?

94
00:09:27,375 --> 00:09:29,666
I see... I can do this.

95
00:09:39,916 --> 00:09:42,291
Wow. Isn't that amazing!

96
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:44,166
Thank you for saving him.

97
00:09:44,583 --> 00:09:46,375
Huh?

98
00:09:52,708 --> 00:09:53,833
What's that?

99
00:09:57,666 --> 00:09:58,625
Ow.

100
00:09:59,833 --> 00:10:01,500
A Witch!

101
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:03,416
I'm Amaki Suwa

102
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:05,750
of the Forty--Seventh
Army Aviation Company.

103
00:10:05,833 --> 00:10:07,333
Sorry to intrude like this.

104
00:10:07,416 --> 00:10:09,166
Nice to meet you...

105
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:11,750
Do you know Yoshika Miyafuji?

106
00:10:11,833 --> 00:10:13,916
Of course... I'm Yoshika.

107
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,125
Oh, thank goodness!

108
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,541
I have a letter for you...
from your dad!

109
00:10:23,083 --> 00:10:25,333
Mom! Grandma!

110
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:27,458
What is this?

111
00:10:27,541 --> 00:10:29,041
It looks like
plans of some kind.

112
00:10:29,125 --> 00:10:31,208
I have no idea what it's for...

113
00:10:31,291 --> 00:10:34,125
So uh... did they
tell you what this was?

114
00:10:34,208 --> 00:10:36,708
My orders were simply to
deliver the letter to you.

115
00:10:36,791 --> 00:10:38,291
Unfortunately, they didn't

116
00:10:38,375 --> 00:10:40,458
give me any details
about its content.

117
00:10:40,791 --> 00:10:43,791
I'm sorry...

118
00:10:43,875 --> 00:10:47,083
I know. Major Sakamoto
used to work with my dad.

119
00:10:47,166 --> 00:10:48,583
Maybe she can figure it out.

120
00:10:48,666 --> 00:10:51,500
Hold on, do you mean Major
Sakamoto from the Naval Academy?

121
00:10:51,583 --> 00:10:53,541
Yes. I'll see her tomorrow.

122
00:10:53,625 --> 00:10:55,041
And I'm going to come with you.

123
00:11:19,875 --> 00:11:21,166
Finally.

124
00:11:52,166 --> 00:11:55,000
It's been a long time since
I've seen Major Sakamoto.

125
00:11:55,083 --> 00:11:56,333
That was so cool.

126
00:11:56,416 --> 00:11:58,500
Those guards just let us
go right through the gate.

127
00:11:58,583 --> 00:12:01,083
I am still commissioned
as a reserve officer...

128
00:12:01,583 --> 00:12:03,750
Major Sakamoto
made sure of that.

129
00:12:03,833 --> 00:12:06,333
Wow. Isn't she the
one that everybody's

130
00:12:06,416 --> 00:12:07,916
so scared of 'cause
she's so mean?

131
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,166
Not at all.

132
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:11,958
She can be strict, but
deep down she's nice...

133
00:12:12,041 --> 00:12:13,625
Although she did
warn me when I left

134
00:12:13,708 --> 00:12:15,958
that I shouldn't ever come
back to the base again.

135
00:12:16,041 --> 00:12:18,125
Huh? How come?

136
00:12:18,208 --> 00:12:19,708
I don't know.

137
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:22,750
Wait... I think we're here.

138
00:12:23,791 --> 00:12:25,083
Really?

139
00:12:25,166 --> 00:12:27,458
Yeah. They told us to
wait in the storage hangar.

140
00:12:35,666 --> 00:12:38,833
That's Major
Sakamoto's Striker Unit...

141
00:12:41,458 --> 00:12:43,708
Hey, didn't you used to fly
around with one of these things

142
00:12:43,791 --> 00:12:46,125
back when you were fighting
with the Strike Witches?

143
00:12:46,208 --> 00:12:49,958
Yeah. It brings back
lots of memories...

144
00:12:51,458 --> 00:12:53,208
Forgive my tardiness...

145
00:12:53,291 --> 00:12:54,958
Sergeant Hijikata.

146
00:12:55,041 --> 00:12:56,583
It's good to see you again.

147
00:12:57,125 --> 00:12:58,375
I'm sorry, Miyafuji.

148
00:12:58,458 --> 00:12:59,750
You came all this way,

149
00:12:59,833 --> 00:13:02,125
but I'm afraid the major
went on leave some time ago.

150
00:13:02,208 --> 00:13:05,208
Huh? On leave?
So where can I find her?

151
00:13:05,291 --> 00:13:06,708
I don't know where she is...

152
00:13:06,791 --> 00:13:08,416
She left her teaching position

153
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,416
at the Witch Academy
earlier this year

154
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:14,041
but she does stay in contact
with me on a regular basis.

155
00:13:14,583 --> 00:13:15,916
Well... tell her...

156
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,250
I got a letter from
my father yesterday.

157
00:13:18,333 --> 00:13:20,458
You got a letter
from Doctor Miyafuji?

158
00:13:20,541 --> 00:13:23,291
I'm sorry, but that
has to be impossible...

159
00:13:23,375 --> 00:13:25,250
He passed away.

160
00:13:25,333 --> 00:13:27,083
Yeah, I can't
explain it, either...

161
00:13:27,166 --> 00:13:30,500
But Major Sakamoto was
very close to my father

162
00:13:30,583 --> 00:13:33,333
so I thought she might be
able to help us figure it out.

163
00:13:33,416 --> 00:13:34,458
I believe you're right...

164
00:13:34,541 --> 00:13:35,708
I'll make sure that
I give this letter

165
00:13:35,791 --> 00:13:38,125
to the major as soon
as she returns to base.

166
00:13:38,208 --> 00:13:40,583
That's great...
I knew you could help.

167
00:13:40,916 --> 00:13:43,375
Well, that was easier
than I thought.

168
00:13:43,458 --> 00:13:44,875
Hey, Yoshika!

169
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:46,625
Long time no see.

170
00:13:46,708 --> 00:13:48,583
Our sweet rice cakes
just haven't tasted

171
00:13:48,666 --> 00:13:50,458
as good without you around.

172
00:13:50,541 --> 00:13:52,708
How 'bout makin' us some!

173
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:55,166
Everybody here really likes you.

174
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:57,625
No, they say
that to all the girls.

175
00:13:57,708 --> 00:13:58,958
Sergeant Hijikata.

176
00:13:59,041 --> 00:14:01,166
There's an emergency flash
from Gallian Command.

177
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:02,041
Gallia?

178
00:14:02,125 --> 00:14:03,625
What is it?

179
00:14:03,708 --> 00:14:05,833
There's been a major change of
status with the European Neuroi.

180
00:14:05,916 --> 00:14:07,083
I'm on my way.

181
00:14:08,875 --> 00:14:10,500
Not the Neuroi...

182
00:14:11,916 --> 00:14:13,708
It's from the Witches
at Gallia Station.

183
00:14:13,791 --> 00:14:16,041
"Report: to all Allied
Force Commanders."

184
00:14:16,125 --> 00:14:19,125
"Unexpected Neuroi contact
above Venezia yesterday..."

185
00:14:19,208 --> 00:14:21,000
"...with a far greater
strike capability

186
00:14:21,083 --> 00:14:22,416
than previous encounters,

187
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:25,083
completely overwhelming
Venezia in a single day.

188
00:14:25,166 --> 00:14:26,875
The Five Hundred and
Fourth Joint Fighter Wing

189
00:14:26,958 --> 00:14:28,791
protecting northern
Romagna engaged them...

190
00:14:28,875 --> 00:14:30,791
but suffered heavy losses

191
00:14:30,875 --> 00:14:32,875
and can no longer
maintain a defense."

192
00:14:32,958 --> 00:14:34,833
Hold on, Did you say
Romagna's Five Hundred

193
00:14:34,916 --> 00:14:36,250
and Fourth
Joint Fighter Wing...?

194
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:37,708
We have a regiment of Witches

195
00:14:37,791 --> 00:14:40,000
from the Fuso Navy currently
stationed with that unit.

196
00:14:40,083 --> 00:14:43,708
But... aren't some of your
friends in Gallia, Yoshika?

197
00:14:43,791 --> 00:14:45,666
This is Sergeant
Hijikata from Fuso.

198
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:47,250
What is the status of
Romagna's Five Hundred

199
00:14:47,333 --> 00:14:48,958
and Fourth Fighter Wing, over?

200
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,541
This is Gallian Command.

201
00:14:51,625 --> 00:14:54,666
Sergeant Lynette Bishop of the
Britannia Air Force reporting.

202
00:14:55,916 --> 00:14:57,416
That's Lynne.

203
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,041
We have no status update.

204
00:14:59,125 --> 00:15:01,041
All attempts to reach
Romagna have failed.

205
00:15:01,125 --> 00:15:03,250
We received a request
for Witch reinforcements,

206
00:15:03,333 --> 00:15:04,500
but we don't have enough

207
00:15:04,583 --> 00:15:06,458
reserves available
to back them up.

208
00:15:06,541 --> 00:15:08,000
Who cares...?

209
00:15:08,083 --> 00:15:10,291
You have to send them whatever
reinforcements you've got...

210
00:15:11,208 --> 00:15:13,416
No... we...

211
00:15:14,375 --> 00:15:15,416
Please repeat that...

212
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,333
Gallian Command,
are you there? Over!

213
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:20,041
It's no use... The ionosphere's
lit up like a Christmas tree.

214
00:15:20,125 --> 00:15:20,833
She's gone.

215
00:15:20,916 --> 00:15:22,583
Damn, we're cut off.

216
00:15:22,666 --> 00:15:24,833
Don't give up. Please
try to reach her again.

217
00:15:24,916 --> 00:15:28,333
Lynne and I fought in the
battle over Britannia together.

218
00:15:28,416 --> 00:15:29,750
Try raising her again.

219
00:15:29,833 --> 00:15:31,250
I'll do my best.

220
00:15:31,333 --> 00:15:33,333
This is the Yokosuka Base
of the Fuso Navy.

221
00:15:33,416 --> 00:15:35,125
Come in Gallian Command.
Do you read?

222
00:15:35,208 --> 00:15:36,750
This is the Fuso Navy.
Do you read?

223
00:15:36,833 --> 00:15:38,166
Please, Lynne...

224
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:40,916
Come on Lynne you have
to say something, please!

225
00:15:46,791 --> 00:15:48,708
Miyafuji. Why are you here?

226
00:15:48,791 --> 00:15:52,666
Uh... Sakamoto... You came back!

227
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:54,500
We've just lost
contact with Lynne...

228
00:15:54,583 --> 00:15:56,416
She said the Neuroi are back.

229
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,250
That is none of your concern.

230
00:15:58,333 --> 00:16:01,666
But Lynne's my friend...
I can't sit and do nothing.

231
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:03,250
Please don't go.

232
00:16:03,333 --> 00:16:05,333
So... she's your friend...

233
00:16:05,416 --> 00:16:07,833
Well, it appears you're
still as stubborn as ever...

234
00:16:07,916 --> 00:16:10,291
The Fuso Navy can
handle the Neuroi crisis

235
00:16:10,375 --> 00:16:12,375
in Europe without
your assistance.

236
00:16:12,458 --> 00:16:13,916
Go home Miyafuji.

237
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,458
You aren't a soldier anymore,
so you do not belong here.

238
00:16:17,541 --> 00:16:19,500
Go. That's an order!

239
00:16:20,666 --> 00:16:22,916
Major Sakamoto...

240
00:16:35,958 --> 00:16:37,291
The Fuso Navy will now embark

241
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:39,916
on an emergency operation
to assist Europe.

242
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,750
Yes, ma'am.

243
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,625
Another mysterious
letter from the professor...

244
00:16:45,708 --> 00:16:48,416
Does this signal the
start of a new battle?

245
00:16:50,125 --> 00:16:52,458
Sergeant... send this letter
to the lab for analysis.

246
00:16:52,541 --> 00:16:54,458
Understood.

247
00:16:55,166 --> 00:16:57,708
So this is the latest
Shidenkai striker unit?

248
00:16:57,791 --> 00:17:00,041
Affirmative. Its magic
output tested higher

249
00:17:00,125 --> 00:17:01,625
than your previous Zero model.

250
00:17:01,708 --> 00:17:03,250
Are you sure about this?

251
00:17:03,333 --> 00:17:05,208
You haven't
even tested it yet...

252
00:17:05,291 --> 00:17:08,125
Yes... There's no more time.

253
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:25,250
Wow. That seaplane is enormous!

254
00:17:26,791 --> 00:17:28,916
Yeah...

255
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:31,041
I see now.

256
00:17:31,125 --> 00:17:32,625
A plane that size
could reach Europe

257
00:17:32,708 --> 00:17:34,833
in a couple of days or less.

258
00:17:39,208 --> 00:17:42,916
Look... That's a Striker Unit.
The newest model.

259
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,708
What's the matter, Yoshika?

260
00:17:44,791 --> 00:17:46,583
She's gonna fly...

261
00:17:46,666 --> 00:17:47,875
Huh?

262
00:17:47,958 --> 00:17:49,666
The Major's planning
to fight the Neuroi again

263
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:51,125
without her shield working...

264
00:17:51,208 --> 00:17:53,958
but there's no way she can
survive a battle without it.

265
00:17:55,291 --> 00:17:57,250
Where are you going?!

266
00:17:57,333 --> 00:18:00,083
Major. If I may, why did
you send Yoshika home?

267
00:18:00,166 --> 00:18:02,250
She's practically a war hero.

268
00:18:02,333 --> 00:18:06,000
Lower. That's it.
Keep it coming.

269
00:18:06,083 --> 00:18:08,375
She served the
Strike Witches very well...

270
00:18:08,458 --> 00:18:12,750
And she fulfilled her
duty... Now she's done.

271
00:18:15,541 --> 00:18:18,500
The Striker Unit is now loaded.
Transportation complete.

272
00:18:18,583 --> 00:18:21,125
H8K is now ready for takeoff.

273
00:18:21,541 --> 00:18:22,875
Engines on!

274
00:18:32,291 --> 00:18:33,916
Sakamoto, don't!

275
00:18:42,083 --> 00:18:43,500
What're you doing here?

276
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:47,833
Wait... you can't--

277
00:18:55,708 --> 00:18:58,333
Yoshika Miyafuji,
prepared for liftoff.

278
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:03,958
I can't let you take off...

279
00:19:04,041 --> 00:19:05,458
You haven't been
cleared by command.

280
00:19:05,541 --> 00:19:08,750
I know... but I have to if
I'm gonna save Sakamoto.

281
00:19:08,833 --> 00:19:11,041
Still... you can't.

282
00:19:11,125 --> 00:19:12,541
Yoshika.

283
00:19:19,666 --> 00:19:21,041
Michiko...

284
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:31,333
It's no use...
I can't do nothing.

285
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:37,125
Go get 'em... But be careful.

286
00:19:38,666 --> 00:19:40,041
I'll be back.

287
00:19:42,416 --> 00:19:43,958
Open up that hangar door!

288
00:19:44,041 --> 00:19:45,041
Understood.

289
00:19:45,125 --> 00:19:47,250
Yes, sir.

290
00:19:53,708 --> 00:19:55,583
Her energy is amazing...

291
00:19:55,666 --> 00:19:56,625
Glide path is clear.

292
00:19:56,708 --> 00:19:57,916
Wind is within range.

293
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,750
Striker Unit
clamping bolts are off.

294
00:20:01,791 --> 00:20:03,625
Ready for takeoff.
Engage at will.

295
00:20:03,708 --> 00:20:04,791
Engage.

296
00:20:17,833 --> 00:20:20,833
Are those cherry
blossoms? No way...

297
00:20:24,291 --> 00:20:26,208
Major Sakamoto...

298
00:20:26,916 --> 00:20:28,125
What are you doing, Yoshika?

299
00:20:28,208 --> 00:20:29,250
Turn back this instant.

300
00:20:29,333 --> 00:20:30,833
Please listen to me, Major...

301
00:20:30,916 --> 00:20:32,625
You have to take me with you.

302
00:20:32,708 --> 00:20:36,041
No. You have your own duties
to attend to in this country.

303
00:20:36,125 --> 00:20:38,125
But... this is my duty...

304
00:20:38,208 --> 00:20:41,416
I swore... to protect them!

305
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:44,208
Protect them...?

306
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:52,375
So I can stay?

307
00:20:53,583 --> 00:20:55,625
Yes... Miyafuji.

308
00:20:57,041 --> 00:20:58,125
Great!

309
00:21:16,333 --> 00:21:18,000
I'm so hungry...

310
00:21:18,083 --> 00:21:19,500
Want an MRE?

311
00:21:19,583 --> 00:21:21,708
I hate dehydrated pig face...

312
00:21:21,791 --> 00:21:24,791
I wanna cooked meal
with some dessert.

313
00:21:24,875 --> 00:21:26,750
Don't be such a wusstard...

314
00:21:26,833 --> 00:21:30,000
We can't get those supplies
over here and you know that.

315
00:21:30,083 --> 00:21:31,541
I hate this.

316
00:21:31,625 --> 00:21:33,458
If I don't get some of Yoshika's
home cooked meals right now,

317
00:21:33,541 --> 00:21:34,833
I'm going to pee!

318
00:21:34,916 --> 00:21:36,958
Throwing a tantrum will
only make you even hungrier.

319
00:21:42,916 --> 00:21:44,625
Acknowledged. This is Yeager.

320
00:21:44,708 --> 00:21:48,958
What? Really? Understood.
We're on our way.

321
00:21:50,041 --> 00:21:53,208
Good news, Francesca. We're
getting supplies from Fuso.

322
00:21:54,583 --> 00:21:57,458
Hot damn. Real food's coming.

323
00:21:57,541 --> 00:21:59,333
Presently we are
above the Adriatic Sea.

324
00:21:59,416 --> 00:22:00,666
If conditions hold,

325
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:03,500
we will reach the Romagna
base in no time, ma'am.

326
00:22:04,666 --> 00:22:06,375
I can finally touch land again.

327
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:07,958
You're soft, Miyafuji.

328
00:22:08,041 --> 00:22:11,208
Complaining about such
a routine flight like this?

329
00:22:11,291 --> 00:22:12,541
I'm sorry...

330
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,708
I was wondering... Did you
ever happen to figure out

331
00:22:15,791 --> 00:22:18,000
what that letter from
my father was all about?

332
00:22:18,083 --> 00:22:20,291
Not yet... But it most
likely has something to do

333
00:22:20,375 --> 00:22:22,541
with the research
he was conducting...

334
00:22:22,625 --> 00:22:24,541
I forwarded it
along to engineering.

335
00:22:24,625 --> 00:22:28,541
My guess is it arrived late
because of security issues.

336
00:22:28,625 --> 00:22:29,833
Not again.

337
00:22:30,875 --> 00:22:33,083
Radar has a bogey
from the southwest...

338
00:22:33,166 --> 00:22:34,458
Approaching rapidly.

339
00:22:34,541 --> 00:22:36,291
What?

340
00:22:41,041 --> 00:22:41,833
Status.

341
00:22:41,916 --> 00:22:43,500
Unidentified craft has engaged.

342
00:22:43,583 --> 00:22:45,291
Engine number one has been hit.

343
00:22:45,375 --> 00:22:47,458
Bogey is even
closer now... Ma'am...?

344
00:22:50,875 --> 00:22:52,000
Oh no...

345
00:22:53,625 --> 00:22:54,916
Neuroi...

346
00:24:29,958 --> 00:24:31,583
Once more, our young hero throws

347
00:24:31,666 --> 00:24:34,166
herself headlong
into the fires of war.

348
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:35,541
She's not alone in this fight

349
00:24:35,625 --> 00:24:37,541
because she has
friends she can trust.

350
00:24:37,625 --> 00:24:41,666
On the next Strike Witches 2:
"The Legendary Witches."
