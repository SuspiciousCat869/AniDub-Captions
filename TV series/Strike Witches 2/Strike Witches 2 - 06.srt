1
00:00:21,166 --> 00:00:24,791
Even if rain falls,
I won't worry...

2
00:00:24,875 --> 00:00:29,291
if spears come flying down,
I won't worry...

3
00:00:29,375 --> 00:00:33,666
Whatever happens, I won't worry.

4
00:00:37,041 --> 00:00:38,250
You know, Eila...

5
00:00:38,333 --> 00:00:40,250
That's dangerous;
you should use your shield.

6
00:00:40,333 --> 00:00:43,458
What...? Haven't you been
paying any attention...?

7
00:00:49,416 --> 00:00:51,208
This is how I do it.

8
00:00:53,291 --> 00:00:54,708
Whoa...! Big, whoa!

9
00:02:26,958 --> 00:02:28,250
Is that all?

10
00:02:28,333 --> 00:02:30,000
Yep, it looks
like we got them...

11
00:02:30,083 --> 00:02:32,625
Seems a bit too easy,
though, doesn't it?

12
00:02:32,708 --> 00:02:34,125
We've taken care
of all the little ones,

13
00:02:34,208 --> 00:02:36,875
but I haven't been able to
find their main controller yet.

14
00:02:36,958 --> 00:02:38,708
Do you think it's still active?

15
00:02:38,791 --> 00:02:41,166
Are you sure we didn't
blow that sucker up already?

16
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:44,291
Don't the small ones disappear
once the main ship is destroyed?

17
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:50,833
What is that?

18
00:02:50,916 --> 00:02:53,250
Look, it goes straight
up through the clouds!

19
00:02:53,333 --> 00:02:54,458
Creepy.

20
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:56,583
No way... Don't tell
me that's the main one.

21
00:02:56,666 --> 00:02:58,916
Wait here... I'll be right back!

22
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,583
Major!

23
00:03:08,041 --> 00:03:10,291
It just keeps going.

24
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:12,583
There's the core.

25
00:03:16,291 --> 00:03:17,666
I can't go higher.

26
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:26,291
This is not good.

27
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:29,916
Temporary retreat...
We're returning to base.

28
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,125
But we haven't eliminated
the enemy yet...

29
00:03:32,208 --> 00:03:34,166
We'll rethink our plan
once we've returned...

30
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:36,750
Everyone has been out
for too long today...

31
00:03:36,833 --> 00:03:39,333
We need to head back before
we run out of magic energy.

32
00:03:55,333 --> 00:03:57,000
Hey, what's that?

33
00:03:57,083 --> 00:03:57,958
What's what?

34
00:03:58,041 --> 00:03:59,583
Is it a twig or something?

35
00:03:59,666 --> 00:04:02,083
Why are you annoying me?
It's nothing.

36
00:04:02,166 --> 00:04:03,583
Where did you find it...?

37
00:04:03,666 --> 00:04:05,625
And why do you even
have it to begin with?

38
00:04:05,708 --> 00:04:07,791
Why do you care? Leave me alone.

39
00:04:07,875 --> 00:04:11,041
Well, can I at least see it?
I'm just curious, that's all.

40
00:04:12,625 --> 00:04:15,666
Good grief... You fly so fast...

41
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:19,666
How do you move
around so quickly like that?

42
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:22,291
Easy; I just use my magic
to see the future...

43
00:04:22,375 --> 00:04:25,291
I have the ability to predict
everyone's movements...

44
00:04:25,375 --> 00:04:27,833
It can be an enemy...
or even you...!

45
00:04:27,916 --> 00:04:31,375
If you wanna be like me,
you need to find some speed!

46
00:04:32,708 --> 00:04:35,291
You really haven't been
paying attention, have you?

47
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:36,750
I don't mean to
brag or anything,

48
00:04:36,833 --> 00:04:39,583
but I've never even used
a shield during combat.

49
00:04:39,666 --> 00:04:41,666
If you ask me, people
who rely on those things

50
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:43,583
will always be second-rate.

51
00:04:43,666 --> 00:04:45,166
Don't say that!

52
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:48,708
People keep telling me my shield
is my only redeeming quality!

53
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:52,541
You know you shouldn't
say things like that, Eila.

54
00:04:55,625 --> 00:04:57,208
Welcome back, everyone.

55
00:04:57,291 --> 00:04:58,416
Thank you!

56
00:04:58,500 --> 00:04:59,708
Hey, Sanya!

57
00:05:04,708 --> 00:05:06,625
I guess you have
night patrol now, huh?

58
00:05:06,708 --> 00:05:08,208
That's right.

59
00:05:08,291 --> 00:05:10,625
Hold on, Sanya.
There's no need tonight.

60
00:05:10,708 --> 00:05:12,541
Return to base with us.

61
00:05:14,583 --> 00:05:16,041
Yes, ma'am.

62
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:24,458
Central Command
contacted us earlier.

63
00:05:24,541 --> 00:05:26,708
About this latest
Neuroi incident?

64
00:05:26,791 --> 00:05:27,833
That's right...

65
00:05:27,916 --> 00:05:29,416
Romagna's navy and
air force want in...

66
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,958
They're going to
take over from here.

67
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:35,791
Apparently, they
want results, too.

68
00:05:37,708 --> 00:05:40,000
I guess we'll sit back
and see how it goes.

69
00:05:47,083 --> 00:05:48,625
It must be hard for
you to carry something

70
00:05:48,708 --> 00:05:50,958
this big around all
the time, huh, Sanya?

71
00:05:51,041 --> 00:05:53,625
No. I'm used to it.

72
00:05:53,708 --> 00:05:55,000
She needs to carry it

73
00:05:55,083 --> 00:05:57,458
because she gets solo night
patrol duty every day.

74
00:05:57,541 --> 00:05:59,958
If anything were to happen,
she could easily hold her own

75
00:06:00,041 --> 00:06:01,791
in a fight with
this Flieger-Hammer.

76
00:06:01,875 --> 00:06:04,958
Really...?
That's so incredible, Sanya.

77
00:06:06,458 --> 00:06:08,375
You know... I bet it's better
when someone's with you.

78
00:06:08,458 --> 00:06:10,250
That way it doesn't
get so lonely.

79
00:06:10,333 --> 00:06:12,000
That's true.

80
00:06:13,041 --> 00:06:16,166
Oh... I almost forgot. Ta-da!

81
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:17,666
Hey...! The twig.

82
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:19,875
From a needle-leaf tree...?
Maybe?

83
00:06:19,958 --> 00:06:21,666
Here you go... for you.

84
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:23,083
You're giving her a twig?

85
00:06:23,166 --> 00:06:25,000
Wow!

86
00:06:25,083 --> 00:06:27,125
Thank you so much, Eila!

87
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,833
We flew near a
cypress forest today,

88
00:06:29,916 --> 00:06:31,583
so I couldn't resist getting it.

89
00:06:31,666 --> 00:06:35,000
The forest looked a little
like Orussia in the winter;

90
00:06:35,083 --> 00:06:36,125
you would've loved it.

91
00:06:36,208 --> 00:06:37,541
There were a lot
of cypress trees

92
00:06:37,625 --> 00:06:39,375
by the house I used to live in.

93
00:06:39,458 --> 00:06:40,708
How sweet!

94
00:06:40,791 --> 00:06:42,666
That's so nice of her!

95
00:06:47,166 --> 00:06:49,375
These photos were
taken by air force recon.

96
00:06:49,458 --> 00:06:52,250
It kinda looks like a scratch
in the film, doesn't it?

97
00:06:52,333 --> 00:06:55,208
You're looking at the Neuroi
that appeared earlier today...

98
00:06:55,291 --> 00:06:56,958
This is a complete shot of it.

99
00:06:57,416 --> 00:06:59,916
Its estimated length is
over thirty thousand meters.

100
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,458
Thirty thousand?!

101
00:07:01,541 --> 00:07:03,291
You mean it's thirty
kilometers tall?!

102
00:07:03,375 --> 00:07:06,833
That's a lot... Compared
to Mt. Fuji, it's like...

103
00:07:06,916 --> 00:07:09,541
It seems to be
headed towards Rome

104
00:07:09,625 --> 00:07:11,666
at approximately ten
kilometers per hour...

105
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:13,291
It's not traveling fast.

106
00:07:13,375 --> 00:07:16,750
The biggest problem we'll have
is the location of its core.

107
00:07:17,541 --> 00:07:18,458
Right here.

108
00:07:18,541 --> 00:07:19,791
The very top?

109
00:07:19,875 --> 00:07:22,291
Yes. I actually saw it up
there with my own eye.

110
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:24,125
But the highest our
Striker Units can go

111
00:07:24,208 --> 00:07:25,916
is only ten thousand meters...

112
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,541
And even that's pushing it.

113
00:07:27,625 --> 00:07:30,791
Yes. That's why our
plan will utilize these.

114
00:07:32,125 --> 00:07:33,583
Rocket boosters.

115
00:07:33,666 --> 00:07:36,791
Will those let us fly all the
way up to where the core is?

116
00:07:36,875 --> 00:07:39,625
No, I seriously doubt
it's as simple as that.

117
00:07:39,708 --> 00:07:41,458
You're right.

118
00:07:41,541 --> 00:07:43,333
The boosters are very powerful,

119
00:07:43,416 --> 00:07:45,541
but they can only fly
for a short period of time

120
00:07:45,625 --> 00:07:48,083
because of the enormous
amounts of energy they consume.

121
00:07:48,166 --> 00:07:50,125
Then why don't we carry
someone part of the way...?

122
00:07:50,208 --> 00:07:52,125
They can just boost
up from there, right?

123
00:07:52,208 --> 00:07:53,541
Yes. Exactly.

124
00:07:53,625 --> 00:07:55,833
Still, thirty thousand
meters high is gonna be rough.

125
00:07:55,916 --> 00:07:57,416
There's not even
any air up there.

126
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,458
What?! Why isn't there air?

127
00:07:59,541 --> 00:08:02,000
You won't be able to
hear anyone then, either.

128
00:08:02,083 --> 00:08:03,416
Oh yeah! That's true, too.

129
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,500
What?! You can't hear anything?

130
00:08:05,583 --> 00:08:07,791
We're talking about
an ultra-high altitude.

131
00:08:07,875 --> 00:08:09,958
One that far surpasses
normal human limits.

132
00:08:10,041 --> 00:08:11,291
It's completely unknown.

133
00:08:11,375 --> 00:08:13,416
Yes, but there's nothing
Witches can't do...

134
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,208
We should all be okay.

135
00:08:16,375 --> 00:08:17,833
Now, we're going to need someone

136
00:08:17,916 --> 00:08:21,208
with instantaneous wide
range attack capabilities...

137
00:08:23,333 --> 00:08:24,416
Sanya...

138
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,958
I would like you
to attack the core.

139
00:08:27,041 --> 00:08:29,791
An attack with your
Flieger-Hammer launcher

140
00:08:29,875 --> 00:08:32,041
will be indispensable
to this particular mission.

141
00:08:32,125 --> 00:08:33,250
Hey! Hey! Hey!

142
00:08:33,333 --> 00:08:35,083
I think I should go with her!

143
00:08:35,166 --> 00:08:38,041
Oh, do you, Eila...?
I have a question...

144
00:08:38,125 --> 00:08:40,416
How many times have you
raised a shield in battle?

145
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:41,541
A shield...?

146
00:08:41,625 --> 00:08:43,458
Yeah, I don't mean
to brag or anything,

147
00:08:43,541 --> 00:08:46,500
but I have never used a
shield in actual combat before.

148
00:08:46,583 --> 00:08:47,458
You can't do it then.

149
00:08:47,541 --> 00:08:48,958
Right...! I can't then!

150
00:08:49,625 --> 00:08:51,708
In this case...
you're just not up to it.

151
00:08:51,791 --> 00:08:53,291
What...? Well, why not?

152
00:08:53,375 --> 00:08:55,583
Besides the use of
boosters in this plan...

153
00:08:55,666 --> 00:08:58,041
surviving the harsh
environment will also consume

154
00:08:58,125 --> 00:09:00,791
an enormous amount
of magic energy...

155
00:09:00,875 --> 00:09:03,250
And that's all before the
attack even takes place.

156
00:09:03,333 --> 00:09:07,041
Which will unfortunately leave
Sanya unable to protect herself.

157
00:09:07,125 --> 00:09:09,583
She'll need someone
to serve as her shield

158
00:09:09,666 --> 00:09:11,458
and keep her out of harm's way.

159
00:09:11,541 --> 00:09:13,708
Okay... I can do that.

160
00:09:13,791 --> 00:09:15,666
I mean it's not like
I can't create a shield.

161
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:17,666
But you've never used
one in actual combat.

162
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:19,208
Right, I knew you'd understand!

163
00:09:19,291 --> 00:09:20,958
That means you can't do it.

164
00:09:23,416 --> 00:09:24,958
Miyafuji! You'll protect her!

165
00:09:25,041 --> 00:09:26,541
Oh... Yes, ma'am.

166
00:09:27,458 --> 00:09:29,125
You have the most
powerful shield here

167
00:09:29,208 --> 00:09:31,583
and are the best
suited for this task.

168
00:09:31,666 --> 00:09:33,416
Yes, ma'am.

169
00:09:41,833 --> 00:09:43,166
Excuse me...

170
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:44,875
But I'd appreciate it if
you'd give me some more room.

171
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:47,625
I would if I could.
It's just cramped in here.

172
00:09:47,708 --> 00:09:51,541
Why on Earth did you wanna meet
me in this stupid sauna, anyway?

173
00:09:51,625 --> 00:09:52,750
Because you're always fighting

174
00:09:52,833 --> 00:09:54,250
with Yoshika for some
weird reason, and...

175
00:09:54,333 --> 00:09:57,041
you know, an enemy of
an enemy is a friend, right?

176
00:09:57,125 --> 00:09:59,208
Yeah, I have no idea
what you're talking about...

177
00:09:59,291 --> 00:10:00,916
Seriously though;
I need to get out of here...

178
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,875
I hate everything about saunas.

179
00:10:03,958 --> 00:10:06,958
Get over it! I just need
you to help me out!

180
00:10:20,166 --> 00:10:21,458
So, Sanya...

181
00:10:21,541 --> 00:10:24,458
What are you doing?
Come on, you four-eyed freak!

182
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:27,083
You know what, I don't like
it when you call me that!

183
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,166
Umm...

184
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:33,791
Are you guys really
sure about this?

185
00:10:33,875 --> 00:10:35,750
Yes, we're sure. Just do it.

186
00:10:35,833 --> 00:10:38,250
Okay... but...

187
00:10:38,333 --> 00:10:39,416
Now... Eila...

188
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:41,291
It's up to you to
pretend that I'm Sanya,

189
00:10:41,375 --> 00:10:42,875
and protect me with your shield.

190
00:10:43,833 --> 00:10:45,333
I can't pretend you're Sanya.

191
00:10:45,416 --> 00:10:47,208
Are you really,
really sure about this?

192
00:10:47,291 --> 00:10:48,791
Just shut up and do it!

193
00:10:48,875 --> 00:10:50,250
Right...! Here goes!

194
00:10:55,791 --> 00:10:56,541
Sorry...

195
00:10:56,625 --> 00:10:57,916
Are you all right, Perrine?

196
00:10:58,416 --> 00:11:00,083
Why did you dodge
the bullet like that...?!

197
00:11:00,166 --> 00:11:02,250
You are defeating the whole
purpose of this training!

198
00:11:02,333 --> 00:11:03,416
Totally my fault...

199
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:06,083
I just can't imagine
why I'd protect you.

200
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:08,583
Well, maybe because
I'm the only person

201
00:11:08,666 --> 00:11:10,083
who's helping you right now?!

202
00:11:10,166 --> 00:11:11,458
Gah...! Lynne, we're waiting.

203
00:11:11,541 --> 00:11:13,500
So, whenever you're
ready, shoot me again!

204
00:11:13,583 --> 00:11:14,708
I don't wanna.

205
00:11:14,791 --> 00:11:16,166
Just do it!

206
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:17,708
Right...! Here goes!

207
00:11:22,125 --> 00:11:23,250
You know...

208
00:11:23,333 --> 00:11:25,500
I so understand
where Eila's coming from.

209
00:11:25,583 --> 00:11:26,708
Yeah, I don't think
I could imagine

210
00:11:26,791 --> 00:11:28,500
protecting Perinne, either.

211
00:11:28,583 --> 00:11:30,250
How many times do
I have to tell you?!

212
00:11:30,333 --> 00:11:32,208
Stop dodging and
use your shield!

213
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,750
Please can we stop!
I don't like this at all!

214
00:11:42,666 --> 00:11:44,208
Weird... What's this?

215
00:11:44,291 --> 00:11:46,375
That's your coat, silly.

216
00:11:47,291 --> 00:11:49,625
It's cold in the
stratosphere, remember.

217
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:53,166
Oh, yeah... I haven't
worn this thing in forever.

218
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:54,666
So... how did it go?

219
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:55,541
Huh?

220
00:11:55,625 --> 00:11:57,625
Your training... with Perrine?

221
00:11:57,708 --> 00:12:00,333
Oh... I uh...
you knew about that?

222
00:12:00,416 --> 00:12:02,125
Yeah, how did it go?

223
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:06,958
Not good... I'm awful.

224
00:12:07,041 --> 00:12:08,916
Sorry.

225
00:12:11,791 --> 00:12:15,416
Sanya? Are you taking all
of those scarves with you?

226
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,625
Oh no... Just one.

227
00:12:17,708 --> 00:12:20,708
The other two are
for you... and Yoshika.

228
00:12:20,791 --> 00:12:22,250
Miyafuji?

229
00:12:22,333 --> 00:12:25,166
Yoshika didn't bring
anything with her from Fuso,

230
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:29,833
so I thought I'd lend her
one of mine... However...

231
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:33,041
I'm still hoping you'll learn
to use a shield, Eila...

232
00:12:33,125 --> 00:12:34,250
Aren't you?

233
00:12:34,333 --> 00:12:35,500
It's no use.

234
00:12:35,583 --> 00:12:39,500
I guess there're some
things I'm not good at.

235
00:12:41,041 --> 00:12:43,250
You mean...
You're gonna give up?

236
00:12:43,333 --> 00:12:45,458
If I can't do it, I can't do it.

237
00:12:45,541 --> 00:12:47,000
It doesn't matter
how hard I try.

238
00:12:47,083 --> 00:12:50,833
But giving up is the whole
reason you can't do it!

239
00:12:52,083 --> 00:12:55,000
Please don't quit now...
You're better than that.

240
00:12:55,083 --> 00:12:56,833
Why don't you just
have Miyafuji protect you?

241
00:12:56,916 --> 00:12:58,833
No need to worry
about her giving up!

242
00:12:59,208 --> 00:13:00,833
Stop being so stupid!

243
00:13:00,916 --> 00:13:02,750
You stop being so bossy!

244
00:13:40,291 --> 00:13:43,833
Hey, Sanya!

245
00:13:47,416 --> 00:13:48,666
Ow... That hurt...

246
00:13:50,416 --> 00:13:52,791
You guys fought? That's funny.

247
00:13:52,875 --> 00:13:56,000
I don't think it's
very funny at all.

248
00:13:57,791 --> 00:14:00,375
Well... are you gonna do
anything about it, Sanya?

249
00:14:00,458 --> 00:14:01,958
Whaddaya mean?

250
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:05,208
Yeah, guess an assignment's
an assignment.

251
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:20,541
I'm told a Romagna fleet
and air unit made contact

252
00:15:20,625 --> 00:15:22,208
with the Neuroi this morning.

253
00:15:22,291 --> 00:15:23,583
Sometime before dawn.

254
00:15:23,666 --> 00:15:25,500
And the result?

255
00:15:25,583 --> 00:15:27,375
Their own attack
ended up leaving the Zara

256
00:15:27,458 --> 00:15:30,166
and Pola cruisers
completely crippled.

257
00:15:31,708 --> 00:15:34,083
So I guess that
means we're up next.

258
00:15:37,791 --> 00:15:40,083
That looks incredible
on you, Francesca!

259
00:15:40,166 --> 00:15:42,083
But I'm hot.

260
00:15:42,166 --> 00:15:44,833
Oh, come on--quit complaining...

261
00:15:44,916 --> 00:15:47,125
The stratosphere is,
like, stupid cold, you know!

262
00:15:47,208 --> 00:15:49,125
I hate it when it's stupid cold.

263
00:15:50,666 --> 00:15:54,583
Here. These are a must-have
for any high altitude season!

264
00:15:54,666 --> 00:15:55,958
I'm hot.

265
00:15:56,041 --> 00:15:58,083
Um, Captain Barkhorn's
coat's a little big on me,

266
00:15:58,166 --> 00:15:59,333
don't ya think?

267
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:01,416
So what? You'd rather
freeze to death instead?

268
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:04,375
Did you make those, Lynne?

269
00:16:04,458 --> 00:16:06,750
Yes, I tried fixing
some ginger tea for us.

270
00:16:06,833 --> 00:16:08,875
It's supposed to
warm up the body.

271
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:10,583
Really...? Thank you.

272
00:16:13,083 --> 00:16:15,625
I added lots of sugar, so it
would be easier to drink...

273
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:17,875
I, uh, hope you all like it.

274
00:16:18,291 --> 00:16:19,541
Grody.

275
00:16:19,625 --> 00:16:22,250
Come on... It's actually
better than I figured...

276
00:16:23,166 --> 00:16:24,500
Oh, I love it!

277
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:28,458
Um... it gets better if
you give it just a little bit.

278
00:16:28,541 --> 00:16:30,083
If you think about it like
you're taking medicine,

279
00:16:30,166 --> 00:16:31,750
it's not that bad at all.

280
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:35,500
Hi, my name is Yoshika, and
I like to wear Sanya's scarf.

281
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:41,666
Ten!

282
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:42,666
Nine!

283
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:43,541
Eight!

284
00:16:43,625 --> 00:16:44,875
Seven!

285
00:16:44,958 --> 00:16:45,791
Six!

286
00:16:45,875 --> 00:16:46,833
Five!

287
00:16:46,916 --> 00:16:47,791
Four!

288
00:16:47,875 --> 00:16:48,666
Three!

289
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:49,875
Two!

290
00:16:49,958 --> 00:16:51,250
One!

291
00:16:58,333 --> 00:16:59,791
First...

292
00:16:59,875 --> 00:17:01,833
we'll utilize Launch Team One,
consisting of five members.

293
00:17:01,916 --> 00:17:05,833
They will climb to ten thousand
meters using normal propulsion.

294
00:17:09,041 --> 00:17:10,875
Once we've reached
our maximum altitude,

295
00:17:10,958 --> 00:17:13,875
Launch Team One will break away
from the rest of the group.

296
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:17,333
Launch Team Two will then

297
00:17:17,416 --> 00:17:19,500
immediately ignite
their rocket boosters...

298
00:17:19,583 --> 00:17:22,541
They will carry the strike
team, Miyafuji and Sanya,

299
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:24,416
to twenty thousand meters.

300
00:17:29,708 --> 00:17:31,166
When that height is reached,

301
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:33,333
Yoshika and Sanya will then
ignite their booster rockets.

302
00:17:33,416 --> 00:17:35,291
They will proceed
to climb even higher,

303
00:17:35,375 --> 00:17:37,666
to thirty-three thousand, three
hundred thirty-three meters,

304
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:39,500
where the Neuroi
core is located.

305
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:42,250
At that point, they'll
switch to a ballistic flight

306
00:17:42,333 --> 00:17:43,333
and head for the core.

307
00:17:43,416 --> 00:17:45,291
Do you know how
cold it is up there...?

308
00:17:45,375 --> 00:17:47,250
Negative seventy
degrees Celsius...

309
00:17:47,333 --> 00:17:49,750
With no air, too...
Without magic,

310
00:17:49,833 --> 00:17:52,833
they'd both die instantaneously.

311
00:17:54,875 --> 00:17:56,166
Although, there's
still no guarantee

312
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:57,875
they'll come back alive.

313
00:17:58,958 --> 00:18:00,625
Okay, it's time!

314
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,375
Let me go! I can do it!
I swear I can!

315
00:18:24,458 --> 00:18:27,458
I'll be the one
to protect Sanya!

316
00:18:28,708 --> 00:18:30,041
What are you doing, Eila?

317
00:18:30,125 --> 00:18:31,666
Please! You said it yourself...!

318
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:33,833
Giving up is the
reason I can't do it!

319
00:18:33,916 --> 00:18:37,291
Remember? I'm not going
to give up! Not on you!

320
00:18:37,375 --> 00:18:40,333
I'm going to protect you, Sanya!

321
00:18:45,166 --> 00:18:46,583
Yoshika!

322
00:18:46,666 --> 00:18:48,541
I got you...! Are you ready?

323
00:18:56,333 --> 00:18:57,666
Yoshika!

324
00:18:57,750 --> 00:19:00,083
You can't, Eila!
Your magic won't last!

325
00:19:00,166 --> 00:19:02,875
You won't be able to come back!

326
00:19:02,958 --> 00:19:05,166
Don't worry. I can
bring her back down.

327
00:19:07,625 --> 00:19:09,916
I'll bring you back. I promise.

328
00:19:13,083 --> 00:19:14,666
Those two have to
be completely crazy!

329
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:17,958
Go girls! Get it! Together!

330
00:21:51,083 --> 00:21:52,333
Can you hear me at all?

331
00:21:52,416 --> 00:21:54,041
Yeah.

332
00:21:54,541 --> 00:21:55,458
I'm sorry.

333
00:21:55,541 --> 00:21:58,375
No. I should apologize, too.

334
00:21:59,583 --> 00:22:01,500
Hey, look over there!

335
00:22:01,583 --> 00:22:03,291
It's Orussia...

336
00:22:03,375 --> 00:22:04,791
Oh yeah...

337
00:22:04,875 --> 00:22:08,291
It's almost like I can
reach the Ural Mountains.

338
00:22:09,291 --> 00:22:10,541
Do you want to
keep flying past them

339
00:22:10,625 --> 00:22:12,958
and see what's
on the other side?

340
00:22:16,375 --> 00:22:20,833
Okay. As long as I'm
with you, I can go anywhere.

341
00:22:24,666 --> 00:22:27,291
I was kidding. I'm sorry.

342
00:22:27,708 --> 00:22:32,541
We have a home... And we get
to go back there... together.

343
00:22:33,208 --> 00:22:35,750
I think I finally understand
where she's coming from...

344
00:22:35,833 --> 00:22:36,958
I know what it's like

345
00:22:37,041 --> 00:22:39,666
to wanna protect someone
more than anything.

346
00:24:29,916 --> 00:24:31,083
Emergency alert!

347
00:24:31,166 --> 00:24:33,541
It appears someone has
infiltrated the base!

348
00:24:33,625 --> 00:24:35,750
All hands, conduct
a search immediately!

349
00:24:35,833 --> 00:24:37,750
On the next Strike Witches Two:

350
00:24:37,833 --> 00:24:40,958
Oh... "It's All Creepy Crawly".
