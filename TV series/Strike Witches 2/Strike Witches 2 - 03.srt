1
00:00:21,083 --> 00:00:23,875
After a new maelstrom of
war broke out in Europe...

2
00:00:23,958 --> 00:00:26,041
the Witches who
previously battled Neuroi

3
00:00:26,125 --> 00:00:29,291
over Britannia gathered
from around the world...

4
00:00:29,375 --> 00:00:31,125
These girls reformed the proud

5
00:00:31,208 --> 00:00:33,791
and honorable 501st
Joint Fighter Wing...

6
00:00:33,875 --> 00:00:38,166
taking to the sky once more
to drive out the enemy Neuroi.

7
00:02:20,291 --> 00:02:23,291
These supplies are a lifesaver.
Thank you so much.

8
00:02:25,041 --> 00:02:26,833
I need to ask you something...

9
00:02:26,916 --> 00:02:29,333
I read the report. Is it true?

10
00:02:29,416 --> 00:02:30,666
It is.

11
00:02:33,458 --> 00:02:35,083
Finally, it appeared
as though we were going

12
00:02:35,166 --> 00:02:37,333
to be able to make
contact with the Neuroi...

13
00:02:43,833 --> 00:02:45,083
But in the end...

14
00:02:45,166 --> 00:02:48,083
we simply failed to
reach an understanding.

15
00:02:48,166 --> 00:02:50,791
An even more vicious
Neuroi started to appear.

16
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:57,166
Please be cautious... Mio.

17
00:02:57,250 --> 00:02:59,291
Of course... the next
time we meet...

18
00:02:59,375 --> 00:03:02,750
I hope it will be under better
circumstances... Take care.

19
00:03:04,125 --> 00:03:05,583
I will.

20
00:03:09,208 --> 00:03:10,291
Let's go, Miyafuji!

21
00:03:10,375 --> 00:03:12,083
Oh... okay!

22
00:03:13,916 --> 00:03:15,666
They made contact with a Neuroi?

23
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:17,041
Technically, no...

24
00:03:17,125 --> 00:03:19,791
They did come very close...
however, just then...

25
00:03:19,875 --> 00:03:21,500
Right before contact,

26
00:03:21,583 --> 00:03:23,583
a new Neuroi appeared
out of the blue...

27
00:03:23,666 --> 00:03:26,541
and it proceeded to obliterate
its humanoid counterpart.

28
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,583
A Neuroi attacked a Neuroi?

29
00:03:29,666 --> 00:03:30,916
Why would it do that?

30
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,166
We're not sure.

31
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:33,250
All we do know...

32
00:03:33,333 --> 00:03:35,875
is that we were
extraordinarily lucky...

33
00:03:35,958 --> 00:03:37,666
Captain Takei did get away...

34
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:40,208
as did the other soldiers
who accompanied her.

35
00:03:40,291 --> 00:03:41,125
Oh, wow.

36
00:03:41,208 --> 00:03:42,458
The Five Hundred and Fourth Wing

37
00:03:42,541 --> 00:03:44,333
is in the process
of being reformed.

38
00:03:44,416 --> 00:03:47,083
But it'll take quite a while
to assemble more witches...

39
00:03:47,166 --> 00:03:48,416
And in the meantime...

40
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,083
the Neuroi are headed
towards the south,

41
00:03:50,166 --> 00:03:51,875
from Venezia to Romagna.

42
00:03:51,958 --> 00:03:54,666
Ground forces are pushing
back as hard as they can...

43
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:57,625
but, if the Neuroi decide to
launch another serious attack...

44
00:03:57,708 --> 00:03:59,458
there won't be near enough...

45
00:03:59,541 --> 00:04:02,041
Only the Strike Witches
will be able to defeat them.

46
00:04:02,125 --> 00:04:04,583
Sakamoto...
Please let me help...

47
00:04:04,666 --> 00:04:07,375
I wanna fight to
protect Romagna, too!

48
00:04:07,458 --> 00:04:09,833
Excellent... I was
hoping you'd say that...

49
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:12,166
You'll begin training as
soon as we get back.

50
00:04:13,375 --> 00:04:14,500
Ma'am!

51
00:04:29,333 --> 00:04:31,333
No doubt, they're
definitely out of shape.

52
00:04:31,416 --> 00:04:32,500
Not surprising.

53
00:04:32,583 --> 00:04:33,666
After the fighting
in Britannia ended...

54
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:35,791
all three of them
left the military...

55
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:38,666
They've been out of practice
for over half a year.

56
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:41,500
And this display isn't
even the worst of it...

57
00:04:41,583 --> 00:04:44,708
Their combat training
this morning was a disaster.

58
00:04:50,583 --> 00:04:52,250
Major... It's much too dangerous

59
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:54,458
to send them
into battle like this.

60
00:04:54,541 --> 00:04:56,958
I agree.

61
00:04:57,041 --> 00:04:58,416
Ladies... Get up!

62
00:05:00,125 --> 00:05:00,916
Yeah, we're up, ma'am.

63
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,166
Yes, major?

64
00:05:04,083 --> 00:05:06,791
Miyafuji... Lynnette...
and Perrine...!

65
00:05:06,875 --> 00:05:09,208
It's time to send you
three back to basic.

66
00:05:09,291 --> 00:05:10,833
Basic?!

67
00:05:18,083 --> 00:05:19,791
That should be it there.

68
00:05:23,416 --> 00:05:26,291
So is this really where we're
supposed to do our training?

69
00:05:26,375 --> 00:05:28,333
Yes, these are the
exact coordinates...

70
00:05:28,416 --> 00:05:30,458
Major Sakamoto gave
them to me herself.

71
00:05:30,541 --> 00:05:32,791
Really...?
Because no one's here.

72
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:35,500
Hey, guys... What's that?

73
00:05:39,375 --> 00:05:41,125
A Neuroi!

74
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,583
Who you callin' a Neuroi?

75
00:05:43,666 --> 00:05:45,500
It talked to me!

76
00:05:45,583 --> 00:05:48,166
Barging into people's yards
without even saying hello...?

77
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:50,125
Jeez, I swear kids these days.

78
00:05:50,208 --> 00:05:51,583
They've got no manners at all.

79
00:05:51,666 --> 00:05:53,958
Um, yes hello!

80
00:05:54,041 --> 00:05:54,833
Excuse me...

81
00:05:54,916 --> 00:05:56,750
but are you Miss Anna Ferrara?

82
00:05:58,416 --> 00:05:59,458
Yeah, that's me.

83
00:05:59,541 --> 00:06:01,583
Oh, good...!
Major Sakamoto gave us

84
00:06:01,666 --> 00:06:03,333
strict orders to
train here with you...

85
00:06:03,416 --> 00:06:05,333
She also told us
not to return...

86
00:06:05,416 --> 00:06:07,958
Not until you give us
a passing grade.

87
00:06:08,958 --> 00:06:11,666
Well, go ahead and
take those off... Go on.

88
00:06:16,625 --> 00:06:17,708
A bucket?

89
00:06:17,791 --> 00:06:19,916
Good, you can see...
First things first.

90
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,375
You need to gather water

91
00:06:21,458 --> 00:06:23,041
for dinner tonight
as well as your bath.

92
00:06:23,125 --> 00:06:24,666
We're getting water?

93
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:26,458
Oh... 'kay...?

94
00:06:26,541 --> 00:06:28,666
Lemme show ya where the well is.

95
00:06:30,958 --> 00:06:32,875
That's really far away.

96
00:06:32,958 --> 00:06:34,083
Yeah.

97
00:06:34,166 --> 00:06:35,625
We're in the middle
of the sea, ladies...

98
00:06:35,708 --> 00:06:38,083
That's the only place
to get fresh water.

99
00:06:38,166 --> 00:06:40,791
But that'll be easy
with our Strikers.

100
00:06:40,875 --> 00:06:41,458
Yeah.

101
00:06:41,541 --> 00:06:43,041
Good point, Lynne...

102
00:06:43,125 --> 00:06:46,000
We'll be there and back in no
time at all... C'mon let's go.

103
00:06:48,583 --> 00:06:51,333
Hold on--I never said you
could use those, did I?

104
00:06:52,958 --> 00:06:55,750
Ta-da...! Use these instead.

105
00:06:55,833 --> 00:06:57,041
I don't understand.

106
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:58,458
Those are brooms...

107
00:07:05,208 --> 00:07:06,458
Let's go!

108
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:23,541
Ow.

109
00:07:23,625 --> 00:07:25,500
Wow... It's really digging...!

110
00:07:37,708 --> 00:07:38,916
Quit acting like
a buncha chickens

111
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,208
and get off the ground...

112
00:07:40,291 --> 00:07:41,958
If you girls wanna
be back for dinner...

113
00:07:42,041 --> 00:07:44,208
then you better get
a move on, ladies.

114
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:51,750
They're supposed
to be Witches...?

115
00:07:51,833 --> 00:07:54,666
Why is Sakamoto
sending me lost causes?

116
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:57,291
You wanna know why you can't
find your balance, Lynne...?

117
00:07:57,375 --> 00:07:59,916
Because these
puppies are way too big.

118
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:04,833
Are you planning on
spinning forever or what?

119
00:08:04,916 --> 00:08:07,375
I dunno! Maybe you
should ask the broom!

120
00:08:14,541 --> 00:08:16,375
Nice... Looks like you're
getting the hang of it.

121
00:08:16,458 --> 00:08:18,125
Yeah, it's... a
piece-a-cake...

122
00:08:18,208 --> 00:08:20,833
Nothing a real
Witch can't handle...

123
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:23,041
Oh--crap--oh--crap--oh--crap...

124
00:08:23,125 --> 00:08:24,291
Don't worry about me...

125
00:08:24,375 --> 00:08:25,875
I'm just working a few
kinks out; that's all...

126
00:08:25,958 --> 00:08:27,416
Really? Is that so?

127
00:08:32,625 --> 00:08:35,500
Ow! It's... rubbing!

128
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:40,125
At this rate,
I seriously doubt any

129
00:08:40,208 --> 00:08:42,208
of you are capable of
passing my training.

130
00:08:42,291 --> 00:08:43,708
You can't mean that!

131
00:08:43,791 --> 00:08:45,250
You're the one who's using

132
00:08:45,333 --> 00:08:47,541
antiquated brooms
for witch training.

133
00:08:47,625 --> 00:08:50,833
There is such a thing
as technology, ya know!.

134
00:08:50,916 --> 00:08:52,291
I'm not doing this.

135
00:08:52,375 --> 00:08:53,625
Perrine!

136
00:08:53,708 --> 00:08:56,000
Well done... I knew you'd
be the first to give up.

137
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:57,458
I'm so confused.

138
00:08:57,541 --> 00:09:00,833
Miss Anna...! I, uh, uh...

139
00:09:00,916 --> 00:09:02,333
Well I just wanted to know...

140
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:05,625
Will this broom-style training
really make us stronger?

141
00:09:05,708 --> 00:09:08,750
Stronger...? Is that what
you want to happen?

142
00:09:08,833 --> 00:09:09,708
Yes, ma'am.

143
00:09:09,791 --> 00:09:10,708
Why's that?

144
00:09:10,791 --> 00:09:12,416
Because... if I'm strong...

145
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:15,083
Then I'll be able to protect
this world from the Neuroi.

146
00:09:15,166 --> 00:09:18,541
I want to help people!

147
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:19,958
Yeah, me too!

148
00:09:24,791 --> 00:09:26,083
Please observe.

149
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,458
Miss Anna?

150
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:37,791
She flew away.

151
00:09:40,333 --> 00:09:43,875
Well, you know what, she
can stay away for all I care.

152
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:46,166
No, wait! She's coming back!

153
00:09:55,916 --> 00:09:57,958
No way! There's so much of it!

154
00:09:58,041 --> 00:09:59,833
You did that by yourself?

155
00:09:59,916 --> 00:10:01,291
Amazing!

156
00:10:01,375 --> 00:10:02,666
But still...

157
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:05,250
I don't understand how
it's gonna make us stronger.

158
00:10:05,333 --> 00:10:07,000
Is it that hard to believe...?

159
00:10:07,083 --> 00:10:10,000
Did you know... your instructor
trained here as well.

160
00:10:10,083 --> 00:10:11,250
Everything she knows started

161
00:10:11,333 --> 00:10:13,375
with what she learned
here training with me.

162
00:10:13,458 --> 00:10:15,166
Wait a sec. Our instructor?

163
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:16,541
Oh, Major Sakamoto!

164
00:10:16,625 --> 00:10:17,708
That's right...

165
00:10:17,791 --> 00:10:19,833
Mio is a very
disciplined young lady...

166
00:10:19,916 --> 00:10:22,541
She respected me from the
first moment she arrived...

167
00:10:22,625 --> 00:10:25,250
and she never gave less
than one hundred percent.

168
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:27,083
Thanks to that,

169
00:10:27,166 --> 00:10:30,083
well, she went on to become
quite a wonderful Witch.

170
00:10:32,875 --> 00:10:35,041
She learned how
to fly a broom, too?

171
00:10:35,125 --> 00:10:36,750
Imagine that.

172
00:10:36,833 --> 00:10:38,541
Uh, so now,

173
00:10:38,625 --> 00:10:41,125
uh, what broom did
you say she used exactly?

174
00:10:41,208 --> 00:10:43,208
I didn't, but it's
the one you were using.

175
00:10:43,291 --> 00:10:45,333
What...?! Are you serious!

176
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:48,875
Oh my... wow...

177
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:52,500
You have no idea how special
you really are broomie, huh?

178
00:10:52,583 --> 00:10:53,833
You gotta be kidding.

179
00:11:10,708 --> 00:11:12,791
I wish we could've taken a bath.

180
00:11:21,166 --> 00:11:22,916
Stupid hag?

181
00:11:23,958 --> 00:11:27,166
It looks like... That's
Sakamoto's handwriting!

182
00:12:03,083 --> 00:12:04,416
I think I'm chafing.

183
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:06,875
For goodness sake...

184
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:09,500
All of you come here right now.

185
00:12:09,583 --> 00:12:12,166
You three have plenty of
magical power to do this...

186
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:14,500
What you do not
have is control...

187
00:12:14,583 --> 00:12:16,375
You must dominate the broom.

188
00:12:16,458 --> 00:12:19,750
Teach it to do what the machines
have been doing for you!

189
00:12:24,625 --> 00:12:26,916
Owie...! It hurts, Miss Anna!

190
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,416
Obviously...

191
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,166
You're bearing down on the
broom; what did you expect?!

192
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:31,833
Think lighter!

193
00:12:32,958 --> 00:12:34,125
Same for you!

194
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:39,875
Listen!

195
00:12:39,958 --> 00:12:41,458
Up until now, you've relied
on the Striker Unit Machines

196
00:12:41,541 --> 00:12:44,166
to do all the work for you...

197
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:47,333
You must forget that in order
to become one with your brooms.

198
00:12:47,416 --> 00:12:49,458
Whaddaya mean "become one"?

199
00:12:49,541 --> 00:12:52,291
Think of it like this:
don't try to ride the broom;

200
00:12:52,375 --> 00:12:54,750
visualize it as an
extension of your body.

201
00:12:54,833 --> 00:12:56,000
So we don't ride it?

202
00:12:56,083 --> 00:12:57,250
That's right...

203
00:12:57,333 --> 00:12:59,666
Imagine that your legs
are moving forward...

204
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:02,458
Then you just have to put
magic behind that thought.

205
00:13:03,958 --> 00:13:06,625
For a real Witch, it
should be relatively simple!

206
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,291
I'm moving, forward...

207
00:13:18,166 --> 00:13:19,375
I think it's working.

208
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,666
Hey...! I'm flying... look!

209
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:29,125
I know! I am too!

210
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:32,125
Wow! I can't believe
it actually worked!

211
00:13:41,583 --> 00:13:44,208
You guys, this is the
most amazing thing ever!

212
00:13:44,291 --> 00:13:46,708
We're actually flying on brooms!

213
00:13:46,791 --> 00:13:47,750
Yeah!

214
00:13:47,833 --> 00:13:49,458
Well, of course we are.

215
00:13:50,208 --> 00:13:51,333
The wind feels different than

216
00:13:51,416 --> 00:13:54,458
when we fly with our
Striker Units, huh?

217
00:13:55,166 --> 00:13:56,416
It's incredible!

218
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:58,625
I know...! It feels so nice.

219
00:13:58,708 --> 00:14:00,375
Yes... Although...

220
00:14:00,458 --> 00:14:03,583
it still rubs some... A lot.

221
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,208
How long are you girls
planning to screw around?

222
00:14:06,291 --> 00:14:08,625
You're supposed to gather
water, remember...?

223
00:14:08,708 --> 00:14:10,000
Hurry, before night falls.

224
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:11,458
Yes, ma'am...

225
00:14:11,541 --> 00:14:12,833
We're just about to leave!

226
00:14:12,916 --> 00:14:14,333
We'll be right back!

227
00:14:23,958 --> 00:14:25,083
Okay...

228
00:14:25,166 --> 00:14:26,708
I suppose that's
enough for today.

229
00:14:26,791 --> 00:14:27,750
We did it!

230
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:28,916
Finally!

231
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,958
Well... wasn't that
hard... Not for me.

232
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:38,666
Thank you for the food!

233
00:14:47,708 --> 00:14:49,250
Yummy!

234
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:54,125
All right, girls;
finish up and take a bath.

235
00:14:59,166 --> 00:15:00,250
Aww...

236
00:15:00,333 --> 00:15:02,000
It's like a tiny,
little puddle...

237
00:15:02,083 --> 00:15:05,166
I know; I guess we really didn't
get that much water after all...

238
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:06,333
Guess not...

239
00:15:06,416 --> 00:15:07,416
Well, tomorrow we'll just have

240
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,083
to fill this thing up
the whole way.

241
00:15:09,166 --> 00:15:10,333
Yep, sounds good.

242
00:15:12,458 --> 00:15:14,416
Perrine, are you not getting in?

243
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:17,000
Oh... of course;
I'll be right there.

244
00:15:24,833 --> 00:15:26,375
It burns.

245
00:15:27,875 --> 00:15:29,666
Gah. You scared me!

246
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:32,666
Are you gonna be okay, Perrine?

247
00:15:37,708 --> 00:15:39,291
This breeze is nice.

248
00:15:39,375 --> 00:15:41,166
Uh huh. It's amazing...

249
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:44,000
So, Witches used to use
brooms to fly around, right...?

250
00:15:44,083 --> 00:15:46,041
I mean before the
Strikers were invented.

251
00:15:46,125 --> 00:15:47,541
Yeah; it seems weird, huh...?

252
00:15:47,625 --> 00:15:49,833
My mom told me that
she learned to fly on one.

253
00:15:49,916 --> 00:15:52,541
But still... we're
floating around on sticks...

254
00:15:52,625 --> 00:15:54,708
Is that really gonna
make us stronger?

255
00:15:54,791 --> 00:15:57,125
Someone is certainly skeptical.

256
00:15:57,208 --> 00:15:59,000
Oh! Hi, Miss Anna!

257
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:00,625
What are you doing out here...?

258
00:16:00,708 --> 00:16:02,500
You girls know you have
an early morning tomorrow.

259
00:16:02,583 --> 00:16:05,041
Uh, we were just
looking at the bridge.

260
00:16:05,125 --> 00:16:07,583
The bridge...? Whatever
would you do that for?

261
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:09,833
Because we...
Well to be honest...

262
00:16:09,916 --> 00:16:12,708
We were wondering why
you even needed a bridge...

263
00:16:12,791 --> 00:16:15,833
I mean, you can fly on a
broomstick and everything, so...

264
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,708
I have it for my daughter...

265
00:16:20,791 --> 00:16:22,833
She doesn't know
how to use magic.

266
00:16:23,625 --> 00:16:24,916
Your daughter?

267
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,291
Yes. She married and
moved away a long time ago...

268
00:16:29,375 --> 00:16:31,125
but she brings
my grandchildren here

269
00:16:31,208 --> 00:16:32,958
to visit a few times a year...

270
00:16:33,041 --> 00:16:34,833
The bridge is for them.

271
00:16:34,916 --> 00:16:36,875
Where does your daughter live?

272
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:38,333
Venezia.

273
00:16:38,416 --> 00:16:39,541
Venezia?!

274
00:16:39,625 --> 00:16:41,458
But the Neuroi
have taken over there!

275
00:16:42,791 --> 00:16:45,458
There's no need to worry...
Everyone's okay...

276
00:16:45,541 --> 00:16:47,916
The entire family made
it out, safe and sound...

277
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,958
Believe it or not, they're
actually on their way here now.

278
00:16:52,583 --> 00:16:55,000
Well then, I hope
they arrive very soon.

279
00:16:55,083 --> 00:16:55,875
So do I!

280
00:16:55,958 --> 00:16:57,250
Yeah! Me too!

281
00:16:58,125 --> 00:16:59,208
You girls get to bed...!

282
00:16:59,291 --> 00:17:01,375
You have intensive
training in the morning!

283
00:17:10,625 --> 00:17:11,750
I can't believe we didn't think

284
00:17:11,833 --> 00:17:13,583
of carrying the
water like this earlier!

285
00:17:13,666 --> 00:17:15,250
Heh... Yeah.

286
00:17:15,333 --> 00:17:18,250
Today that bath is gonna
be filled up the whole way!

287
00:17:18,333 --> 00:17:20,708
Yeah...! Water up
to our shoulders...!

288
00:17:20,791 --> 00:17:22,750
Right...? Sounds good, huh?

289
00:17:24,166 --> 00:17:26,958
Yes, well either way it
doesn't really matter to me.

290
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:33,416
Did you see that?

291
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:34,000
Oh no!

292
00:17:34,083 --> 00:17:35,416
It's a Neuroi!

293
00:17:37,583 --> 00:17:39,291
According to observation
team reports...

294
00:17:39,375 --> 00:17:41,041
it's travelling
in a direct line,

295
00:17:41,125 --> 00:17:43,416
here, along the
Adriatic Sea coastline

296
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,333
from Venezia toward Bari.

297
00:17:45,416 --> 00:17:47,500
So it's obviously
the kind of Neuroi

298
00:17:47,583 --> 00:17:50,083
that can only move
in straight lines.

299
00:17:53,041 --> 00:17:55,708
Interception
will be... open sea.

300
00:17:55,791 --> 00:17:56,916
Interesting...

301
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,666
It appears it should
skirt the continent...

302
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:00,791
I don't think it'll go ashore.

303
00:18:00,875 --> 00:18:03,458
I guess we won't need
to scramble the squad then.

304
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,583
Wait...!

305
00:18:07,666 --> 00:18:09,125
The girls!

306
00:18:09,208 --> 00:18:10,708
I've got bad news, Miss Anna...!

307
00:18:10,791 --> 00:18:12,583
There's a Neuroi on the way!

308
00:18:12,666 --> 00:18:14,125
I know...

309
00:18:14,208 --> 00:18:15,875
I just received confirmation
from your base to that effect.

310
00:18:15,958 --> 00:18:18,125
So does that mean there's
a squadron coming to help?

311
00:18:18,208 --> 00:18:20,750
I'm sorry to say there's not...

312
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:22,041
They said any witches they send

313
00:18:22,125 --> 00:18:23,791
would never make
here it in time...

314
00:18:23,875 --> 00:18:27,500
Our only choice is to
abandon this house, right now.

315
00:18:28,333 --> 00:18:29,541
We can't!

316
00:18:33,708 --> 00:18:35,416
It's like it's
coming straight for us.

317
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:38,291
At this rate... the
island and the bridge...

318
00:18:38,375 --> 00:18:40,333
They'll both be
completely destroyed.

319
00:18:40,416 --> 00:18:41,291
What are you doing...?

320
00:18:41,375 --> 00:18:42,375
It's time for us to go...

321
00:18:42,458 --> 00:18:43,916
We are leaving immediately!

322
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,291
No! We can't just
abandon this place!

323
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:47,666
But what about your family?

324
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:50,125
Won't they be here soon?

325
00:18:50,208 --> 00:18:52,958
Listen... If you abandon
the island and the bridge...

326
00:18:53,041 --> 00:18:55,583
then your family won't have
anywhere to call home anymore...

327
00:18:55,666 --> 00:18:57,625
and that's not what
you want, is it?

328
00:18:58,708 --> 00:19:00,083
It's too dangerous...

329
00:19:01,541 --> 00:19:02,708
Liftoff!

330
00:19:09,291 --> 00:19:11,666
Here's the plan: Lynne and
I will attack in formation...!

331
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:13,708
Miyafuji, you cover us!

332
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:15,041
Understood!

333
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:25,500
Commence attack!

334
00:19:40,833 --> 00:19:42,166
It's strong!

335
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:43,916
We need more firepower if
we're gonna break through!

336
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,958
I think we should all
attack at the same time!

337
00:19:46,041 --> 00:19:47,291
We can't...

338
00:19:47,375 --> 00:19:49,666
A three--person formation
is too advanced for us!

339
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:50,875
No it's not!

340
00:19:50,958 --> 00:19:53,791
We can do this, Lynne;
I know we can!

341
00:19:54,791 --> 00:19:55,958
Yeah! Let's go!

342
00:19:56,041 --> 00:19:57,250
Alright!

343
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,541
I can read everyone's moves!

344
00:20:12,625 --> 00:20:14,000
And dodge the beams easily!

345
00:20:14,083 --> 00:20:15,875
It's because of the brooms!

346
00:20:17,958 --> 00:20:19,125
There's the core!

347
00:20:19,208 --> 00:20:21,125
It's already
starting to regenerate!

348
00:20:21,208 --> 00:20:23,583
Hurry, we've
gotta destroy it now!

349
00:20:23,666 --> 00:20:24,708
Leave it to me!

350
00:20:27,958 --> 00:20:29,541
It's too late!

351
00:20:31,166 --> 00:20:33,333
Look out! Move!

352
00:20:36,208 --> 00:20:37,250
I'm coming, Lynne!

353
00:20:37,333 --> 00:20:39,000
Please, Yoshika! Save me!

354
00:20:47,541 --> 00:20:48,916
Good job, girls!

355
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,041
I'll use my shield to get
us as close as possible...!

356
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:52,958
You aim for the core, okay?

357
00:20:53,041 --> 00:20:54,166
Got it!

358
00:20:54,875 --> 00:20:56,083
It's almost to the island!

359
00:20:56,166 --> 00:20:58,458
Let's do this...
I'll provide cover.

360
00:21:11,583 --> 00:21:12,416
There's the core!

361
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:13,833
Lynne, shoot it now!!

362
00:21:13,916 --> 00:21:15,500
Here goes!

363
00:21:24,625 --> 00:21:25,583
Look! We did it!

364
00:21:25,666 --> 00:21:28,208
Hooray...! Great
job shooting, Lynne!

365
00:21:28,291 --> 00:21:30,416
Thanks...! The best
part is the bridge

366
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:32,041
and island are still okay!

367
00:21:44,375 --> 00:21:46,875
All three of you... pass...

368
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:52,083
This is Sakamoto.

369
00:21:52,166 --> 00:21:54,541
I just wanted to call
and thank you for your help.

370
00:21:54,625 --> 00:21:55,791
No, don't mention it.

371
00:21:55,875 --> 00:21:57,416
Those girls were
no trouble at all...

372
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:59,083
They didn't cry
themselves to sleep,

373
00:21:59,166 --> 00:22:01,708
unlike someone else I know.

374
00:22:05,375 --> 00:22:06,083
Whoo!

375
00:22:06,166 --> 00:22:07,250
Yay!

376
00:22:07,333 --> 00:22:08,791
Girls, hush!

377
00:22:08,875 --> 00:22:10,166
Stupid hag...

378
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:12,250
What do you mean?
I never cried!

379
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:16,333
Would everyone shut
your traps! I can't hear!

380
00:22:17,875 --> 00:22:20,166
Now then...
as I was about to say...

381
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:21,583
Yes?

382
00:22:21,666 --> 00:22:25,208
Those girls show a lot of
promise... very talented.

383
00:22:25,291 --> 00:22:27,708
Thank you. I agree completely.

384
00:22:27,791 --> 00:22:29,500
Hey, you! Get off that table!

385
00:24:29,875 --> 00:24:33,208
Behold, Liberion!
Karlsland's ultimate weapon!

386
00:24:33,291 --> 00:24:35,416
The Neuroi don't
stand a chance now!

387
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:36,791
Ooh, let me try it!

388
00:24:36,875 --> 00:24:38,208
No!

389
00:24:38,291 --> 00:24:41,625
On the next Strike Witches Two:
"Hard, Fast, Amazing"!
