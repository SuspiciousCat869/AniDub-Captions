[NIIMI]
I can't believe it.

00:01:50,433 --> 00:01:52,560
One of them actually survived.

3
00:01:52,644 --> 00:01:54,479
[RESEARCHER 2A] Their bodies
are frighteningly tough.

4
00:01:54,562 --> 00:01:58,274
I mean, that Gatlantean ship
was smashed to pieces.

5
00:01:58,358 --> 00:01:59,401
[RESEARCHER 2B]
We've found signs

00:01:59,484 --> 00:02:01,611
of artificial manipulation
in his DNA.

7
00:02:01,695 --> 00:02:03,571
[RESEARCHER 2A] Are you saying
you think they're not

8
00:02:03,655 --> 00:02:05,490
pure humanoids, then?

9
00:02:05,573 --> 00:02:07,867
[NIIMI] Is it possible that
they're manufactured life forms?

10
00:02:07,951 --> 00:02:09,619
Artificial soldiers?

11
00:02:09,703 --> 00:02:11,079
Didn't you encounter
some of them

12
00:02:11,162 --> 00:02:12,956
while serving on
the <i>Yamato,</i> Niimi?

13
00:02:13,039 --> 00:02:14,249
We certainly did.

14

Hold on, I'll go get
the research data.

15
00:02:28,388 --> 00:02:31,391
We've confirmed it, Ambassador.
There's a Gatlantean soldier

16
00:02:31,474 --> 00:02:34,853
being held in an Earth
Force research facility.

17
00:02:34,936 --> 00:02:37,814
We have to warn them!
Tell them to stop!

18
00:02:37,897 --> 00:02:39,149
[RESEARCHER 2B]

19
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:40,275

[RESEARCHER 2A]
We're too late!

00:03:07,385 --> 00:03:09,012
[PRESIDENT]
People of the world!

24
00:03:09,095 --> 00:03:12,057
Today, as the first President of
the Earth Federation Government,

25
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:14,392
it is with great honor
and pride that I make this

26
00:03:14,476 --> 00:03:18,188
historic announcement. A new era
of space power is upon is!

27
00:03:18,271 --> 00:03:22,942
The cutting-edge Andromeda-class
ships are now complete!

28
00:03:23,026 --> 00:03:26,071
Peace in space.
That is our ultimate goal.

29
00:03:26,154 --> 00:03:28,865
And the means to realize
and defend that peace

30
00:03:28,948 --> 00:03:33,161
is the strong alliance
between Earth and Gamilas.

31
00:03:33,244 --> 00:03:35,705
As the symbol of assuming
such a responsibility,

32
00:03:35,789 --> 00:03:37,582
the flagship of this
new class, the <i>Andromeda...</i>

33
00:03:37,665 --> 00:03:39,125
[BURRELL]
Why didn't you tell us

34
00:03:39,209 --> 00:03:43,046
that you'd recovered an enemy
survivor from the operation?

35
00:03:43,129 --> 00:03:44,714
[PRESIDENT] ...I have no doubt
her four sister ships

36
00:03:44,798 --> 00:03:48,843
you see here today will
perform just as admirably...

37
00:03:48,927 --> 00:03:50,845
Unless certain
measures are taken,

38
00:03:50,929 --> 00:03:54,265
a Gatlantean soldier's body will
automatically self-destruct.

39
00:03:54,349 --> 00:03:56,393
It's a central feature
of their design.

40
00:03:56,476 --> 00:03:59,104
If you'd informed us
we could have warned you.

41
00:03:59,187 --> 00:04:00,980
With due respect, Ambassador,

42
00:04:01,064 --> 00:04:02,982
if you knew this
about our common foe

43
00:04:03,066 --> 00:04:06,569
then why didn't you share such
a crucial fact from the start?

44
00:04:06,653 --> 00:04:09,197
Are you suggesting that
the fault lies with us?

45
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,825
You should at least have told
us before the joint operation.

46
00:04:11,908 --> 00:04:14,744
We've had some unfortunate
misunderstandings in the past.

47
00:04:14,828 --> 00:04:15,912
But Earth and Gamilas

48
00:04:15,995 --> 00:04:17,831
are supposed to be
allied worlds now.

49
00:04:17,914 --> 00:04:21,918
I can only hope that means you
see us as equal partners.

50
00:04:29,634 --> 00:04:31,720
[TODO] The Earth's population
is still less than a third

51
00:04:31,803 --> 00:04:34,097
of what it once was.
Even though the collapse

52
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:37,851
of the Desler Regime has
left Gamilas in disarray.

53
00:04:37,934 --> 00:04:40,145
With our skeleton fleet it
would have been easy for you

54
00:04:40,228 --> 00:04:43,106
to invade if you'd wanted.
But I'm sure you'll realize

55
00:04:43,189 --> 00:04:45,734
with these ships that's
no longer the case.

"Jumping at shadows."

57

That's a saying we have in
the Gamilan language, too.

We haven't been able
to confirm it yet.

But we think it's possible
they've heard Teresa's voice.

Really?

72
00:06:02,602 --> 00:06:04,646
The Earth's government
has figured it out, too.

00:06:04,729 --> 00:06:07,774
I'm going to try and meet
with them directly and talk

before information leaks
from the Gamilas home world.

of their departments
and fields of expertise.

159
00:10:35,083 --> 00:10:37,335
I hope that gives you peace.

160
00:10:37,419 --> 00:10:40,964
Pay your respects to Juzo Okita,
captain of the <i>Yamato</i> !

161
00:10:41,047 --> 00:10:42,882
Attention!

162
00:10:59,149 --> 00:11:04,154
[YAMATO CREW chatting, laughing]

163
00:11:06,906 --> 00:11:10,326
[SANADA]
Kodai. I'm sorry.

164
00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:13,580
I shouldn't have made you bear
that whole burden on your own.

165
00:11:13,663 --> 00:11:15,248
It's fine.

166
00:11:18,126 --> 00:11:21,713
There's something
nagging at me though.

167
00:11:21,796 --> 00:11:24,507
Right after that incident, there
was communication interference

168
00:11:24,591 --> 00:11:26,384
all throughout the solar system.

169
00:11:26,468 --> 00:11:27,594
[KODAI]
Yeah.

170
00:11:27,677 --> 00:11:29,929
But no one has been
able to explain it yet.

171
00:11:30,013 --> 00:11:31,681
Uh?

172
00:11:31,765 --> 00:11:33,266
[SANADA]
Kodai...

173
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:36,061
When it happened,
who did you see?

174
00:11:36,144 --> 00:11:39,397
[OKITA]
Kodai, board the <i>Yamato.</i>

175
00:11:41,566 --> 00:11:43,068
[SHIMA]
I saw my dead father.

176
00:11:43,151 --> 00:11:44,235
[gasps]

177
00:11:44,319 --> 00:11:46,112
It'd been ten years
since I'd seen him.

178
00:11:46,196 --> 00:11:50,158
But he was still as tight-lipped
as he ever was.

179
00:11:50,241 --> 00:11:51,910
[TOKUGAWA]
I saw mine, too.

180
00:11:51,993 --> 00:11:53,495
[AIHARA]
That's crazy--so did I!

181
00:11:53,578 --> 00:11:55,789
He was calling out to me,
clear as day.

182
00:11:55,872 --> 00:11:57,248
He said, "Board the <i>Yamato</i> !"

183
00:11:57,332 --> 00:12:00,293
[YAMATO CREW murmuring]

184
00:12:00,377 --> 00:12:02,671
[OTA]
That's so many of us!

185
00:12:02,754 --> 00:12:04,255
Do you think the <i>Yamato</i> 's
former crew

186
00:12:04,339 --> 00:12:06,007
was targeted somehow?

187
00:12:06,091 --> 00:12:08,968
Such similar hallucinations seen
by so many at the same time

188
00:12:09,052 --> 00:12:11,721
obviously poses
compelling questions.

189
00:12:11,805 --> 00:12:14,349
Military command seems to be
investigating it too.

190
00:12:14,432 --> 00:12:16,267
Command.

191
00:12:16,351 --> 00:12:18,561
These new ships with
Wave Motion Guns,

192
00:12:18,645 --> 00:12:20,772
and the aggressive
plans for expansion.

193
00:12:20,855 --> 00:12:22,399
What we brought
back from Iscandar

194
00:12:22,482 --> 00:12:23,608
was supposed to save us,

195
00:12:23,692 --> 00:12:26,945
not make us into some
galactic superpower.

196
00:12:28,655 --> 00:12:30,949
[OTA] It's like the <i>Yamato</i>
called out to us.

197
00:12:31,032 --> 00:12:34,077
Like it's unhappy with
the direction we're headed.

198
00:12:36,746 --> 00:12:39,249
The <i>Yamato</i> , huh.

199
00:12:39,332 --> 00:12:43,795
[MORI] Kodai, who did you
see in your vision?

200
00:12:43,878 --> 00:12:47,090
As for me,
I didn't see anybody.

201
00:12:52,721 --> 00:12:53,972
The <i>Andromeda</i> !

202
00:12:54,055 --> 00:12:56,975
That's the flagship
of the new class.

203
00:13:16,786 --> 00:13:19,330
[NANBU]
You idiots!

204
00:13:28,048 --> 00:13:31,009
[SANADA] There's something
I want the two of you to see.

205
00:13:31,092 --> 00:13:32,802
What is that?
It looks like a comet.

206
00:13:32,886 --> 00:13:34,429
It's an unknown quasar.

207
00:13:34,512 --> 00:13:36,389
We found it during
spatial corrections.

208
00:13:36,473 --> 00:13:39,100
It's actually traveling
toward our solar system,

209
00:13:39,184 --> 00:13:42,228
moving incredibly close
to the speed of light.

210
00:13:42,312 --> 00:13:44,022
Of course it's something
we'll want to monitor,

211
00:13:44,105 --> 00:13:46,024
but it won't reach the
Earth's sphere of influence

212
00:13:46,107 --> 00:13:48,151
for tens of thousands of years.

213
00:13:48,234 --> 00:13:49,778
The far more pressing issue?

214
00:13:49,861 --> 00:13:52,697
The energy waves we think
caused the hallucinations--

215
00:13:52,781 --> 00:13:55,116
we're fairly sure that they
came from the same place.

216
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,911
Exactly the same direction
as that quasar.

217
00:13:57,994 --> 00:13:59,621
The waves were
super-directional,

218
00:13:59,704 --> 00:14:01,414
and clearly pointed at Earth.

219
00:14:01,498 --> 00:14:03,291
So these waves were
aimed at us.

220
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:05,335
And somehow affected our minds?

221
00:14:05,418 --> 00:14:07,671
And showed us visions
of people from our past?

222
00:14:07,754 --> 00:14:09,089
[SANADA]
Exactly.

223
00:14:09,172 --> 00:14:10,882
And the truth is, the
energy waves were logged

224
00:14:10,965 --> 00:14:13,134
in the <i>Yamato</i> 's
recorder as well.

225
00:14:13,218 --> 00:14:16,680
I managed to take it out before
the military collected it.

226
00:14:16,763 --> 00:14:18,723
I'll display the data now.

227
00:14:22,644 --> 00:14:24,479
[SHIMA, KODAI gasping]

228
00:14:24,562 --> 00:14:25,772
[SANADA]
That's strange.

229
00:14:25,855 --> 00:14:28,191
The data is out of control.

230
00:14:30,151 --> 00:14:33,530
[TERESA]
Warriors of a distant star,

231
00:14:33,613 --> 00:14:37,659
my hope now rests with you.

232
00:14:47,502 --> 00:14:50,505
You saw that, too, Shima?

233
00:14:50,588 --> 00:14:51,381
[SHIMA]
Uh?

234
00:14:51,464 --> 00:14:53,341
Someone was kneeling.

235
00:14:53,425 --> 00:14:57,679
Like in prayer.
Calling for help.

236
00:14:57,762 --> 00:15:00,807
Uh! Sanada, you saw it, right?

237
00:15:00,890 --> 00:15:04,185
They must be asking for us
to go to its origin point.

238
00:15:04,269 --> 00:15:05,562
Here.

239
00:15:05,645 --> 00:15:07,022
[SHIMA]
Look out!

240
00:15:07,105 --> 00:15:09,107
Kodai, calm down.

241
00:15:09,190 --> 00:15:12,652
I have to say I agree with
your assessment, Kodai.

242
00:15:12,736 --> 00:15:14,529
It's hardly scientific.

243
00:15:14,612 --> 00:15:18,199
Still, somehow we've all
been sent these visions.

244
00:15:18,283 --> 00:15:20,243
And our hearts have been shaken.

245
00:15:22,871 --> 00:15:28,335
In my view, we're
being called upon.

246
00:15:28,418 --> 00:15:30,754
To the far reaches of space,

247
00:15:30,837 --> 00:15:33,590
by someone whose very
existence is in peril.

248
00:15:33,673 --> 00:15:37,260
Our hearts can understand
that all too well.

249
00:15:42,932 --> 00:15:45,143
[KODAI]
We should go!

250
00:15:45,226 --> 00:15:48,438
No matter who it is,
or how far away they are!

251
00:15:48,521 --> 00:15:50,648
That's what Captain
Okita was telling me.

252
00:15:50,732 --> 00:15:51,983
I'm sure of it now.

253
00:15:52,067 --> 00:15:53,943
If someone's out there
in space asking for help,

254
00:15:54,027 --> 00:15:55,737
then we should answer the call!

255
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:56,738
We have to!

256
00:15:56,821 --> 00:15:58,031
Kodai.

257
00:16:12,295 --> 00:16:14,631
[KODAI]
Shima, surely you understand.

258
00:16:14,714 --> 00:16:18,134
A sailor must never abandon
those who are in need of help.

259
00:16:18,218 --> 00:16:21,262
You know your father would
tell you the same thing.

260
00:16:21,346 --> 00:16:22,681
[SHIMA] You're jumping
to conclusions.

261
00:16:22,764 --> 00:16:24,516
We don't have
enough information.

262
00:16:24,599 --> 00:16:28,269
[KODAI] Well, I know this: no
one can fly the <i>Yamato</i> like you!

263
00:16:31,898 --> 00:16:34,025
[KODAI] The original
crew of the <i>Yamato</i> --

264
00:16:34,109 --> 00:16:37,862
hundreds of them--all
receiving the same message!

265
00:16:37,946 --> 00:16:40,407
The military can't ignore that.

266
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:41,908
If we call on them to act--

267
00:16:41,991 --> 00:16:43,993
[SHIMA] If talking to the
military would make them act,

268
00:16:44,077 --> 00:16:47,205
then I never would have quit.

269
00:16:47,288 --> 00:16:50,792
And don't forget, you're not
on your own anymore.

270
00:16:50,875 --> 00:16:53,712
You should be thinking
about Mori, too.

You're under surveillance.

274

Every person who served on
the <i>Yamato</i> is being watched.

275
00:17:58,526 --> 00:17:59,527
[KODAI]
But why?

276
00:17:59,611 --> 00:18:02,072
I'm fairly certain
you can guess why.

Okay, who are you?

This humidity's awful.

280
00:18:16,336 --> 00:18:20,090
I don't know how you
Earthlings can tolerate it.

281
00:18:20,173 --> 00:18:22,467
I'm not asking you to
let go of the past.

282
00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:27,764
I know I haven't. My people
lost a lot in that war, too.

283
00:18:27,847 --> 00:18:30,767
But we Gamilans do owe
the <i>Yamato</i> a debt.

284
00:18:30,850 --> 00:18:32,686
I plan to pay.

285
00:18:32,769 --> 00:18:34,354
[KODAI]
Uh.

286
00:18:36,606 --> 00:18:39,025
I would like you to go
to the moon with me.

287
00:18:39,109 --> 00:18:40,360
[KODAI]
The moon?

288
00:18:40,443 --> 00:18:43,571

to the Gamilan Embassy.

[YAMAMOTO]
Come on, you guys!

290
00:18:52,455 --> 00:18:54,416
[YAMAMOTO]
It's been more than 15 seconds.

291
00:18:54,499 --> 00:18:56,251
You haven't even grazed me.

292
00:18:56,334 --> 00:18:59,212
You're making those fancy
new models look pathetic.

Time's up.

295
00:19:06,761 --> 00:19:08,930

[TSURUMI] Instructor Yamamoto
was one harsh woman.

300
00:19:23,236 --> 00:19:25,030
[PILOT 2A]
What's up with Instructor Kato?

301
00:19:25,113 --> 00:19:27,157
It's his third time
off this month.

302
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:29,367
[PILOT 2B]
Is his son really that sick?

303
00:19:29,451 --> 00:19:31,995
[TSURUMI] I hear it's space
radiation sickness.

grasping at straws, though.

00:20:03,985 --> 00:20:06,196
fake an accidental
fire in the bay,

315
00:20:06,279 --> 00:20:09,407
then drop to the moon's surface
with the purged cargo.

316
00:20:15,288 --> 00:20:16,289
[KEYMAN]
But there's a squadron

317
00:20:16,373 --> 00:20:17,999
of unmanned
counter-terrorist drones

318
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:20,877
around the embassy,
so stay on your toes.

319
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:25,382
[KEYMAN]
Meet with Ambassador Burrell,

320
00:20:25,465 --> 00:20:28,009
and you'll learn the truth
behind those visions.

321
00:20:28,093 --> 00:20:29,761
This mission is vital.

322
00:20:29,844 --> 00:20:32,389
It could change the fates
of Earth and Gamilas.

323
00:20:32,472 --> 00:20:33,723
This is just the first step,

324
00:20:33,807 --> 00:20:36,226
so try not to make
any careless mistakes.

325
00:20:36,309 --> 00:20:40,063
This Klaus Keyman.
He's no embassy liaison.

326
00:20:41,231 --> 00:20:44,150
But for right now I just
need to keep moving.

327
00:20:44,234 --> 00:20:47,904
[beeping]

328
00:21:08,925 --> 00:21:10,844
[YAMAMOTO]
Yamamoto of Cosmo Tiger Team

329
00:21:10,927 --> 00:21:12,387
to Lunar Surface Base.

330
00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:14,973
Reporting incursion into
Gamilan embassy airspace

331
00:21:15,056 --> 00:21:16,099
during training.

332
00:21:16,182 --> 00:21:18,309
Notify Gamilans
this was accidental,

333
00:21:18,393 --> 00:21:20,103
and tell them I'm sorry.

334
00:21:25,942 --> 00:21:27,527
[YAMAMOTO]
Stay safe.

335
00:22:06,691 --> 00:22:08,151
[SABERA]
Emperor Zworder,

336
00:22:08,234 --> 00:22:12,197
we may have determined where
Teresa's cosmo wave was sent.

337
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:13,490
[ZWORDER]
Hmm?

338
00:22:14,199 --> 00:22:18,119
[SABERA]
It is a pitifully remote planet.

339
00:22:18,203 --> 00:22:20,747
However, one ship
from our advance fleet

340
00:22:20,830 --> 00:22:23,249
has vanished while
within its perimeter.

341
00:22:23,333 --> 00:22:25,794
We believe it may be
the home world of the race

342
00:22:25,877 --> 00:22:29,381
who has formed an
alliance with Gamilas.

343
00:22:29,464 --> 00:22:31,716
We've found Earth?

344
00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:38,181
[SABERA] His Imperial
Majesty has decided

345
00:22:38,264 --> 00:22:39,933
the Gatlantis Empire!

346
00:22:40,016 --> 00:22:41,768
Forward!

347
00:24:57,862 --> 00:24:59,739
[BURRELL]
Those called by Teresa.

348
00:24:59,823 --> 00:25:02,033
Surely you found
it suspicious--

349
00:25:02,117 --> 00:25:04,077
how fast they churned
out the <i>Andromeda</i> .

350
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:05,453
[SANADA]
I'll refit the <i>Yamato.</i>

351
00:25:05,537 --> 00:25:06,913
[KODAI]
That's what you call this?!

352
00:25:06,996 --> 00:25:08,331
[NANBU]
This is not okay!

353
00:25:08,415 --> 00:25:11,001
[KODAI]
Come on! I can't do this alone!
