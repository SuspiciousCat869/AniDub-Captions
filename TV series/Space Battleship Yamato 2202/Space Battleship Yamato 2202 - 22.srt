1
00:01:54,229 --> 00:01:56,314
[YUKI]
It'll be a year soon, won't it?

2
00:01:56,398 --> 00:01:58,191
[KODAI]
Mm-hm.

3
00:01:58,274 --> 00:02:00,318
[YUKI]
It almost feels like magic.

4
00:02:00,402 --> 00:02:02,237
[KODAI]
Maybe it is magic.

5
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,613
[YUKI]
Hm?

6
00:02:03,697 --> 00:02:05,657
[KODAI] Think about it,
the Earth came back to life.

7
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:08,952
The sky, and the sea.

8
00:02:09,035 --> 00:02:10,745
Sometimes I wonder.

9
00:02:10,829 --> 00:02:14,541
All of this...
is any of it even real?

10
00:02:14,624 --> 00:02:17,210
[YUKI] In all the vast
expanse of space,

11
00:02:17,293 --> 00:02:22,048
somehow, we still met,
and here we are, together.

12
00:02:22,132 --> 00:02:25,552
So why not believe that
every single human being

13
00:02:25,635 --> 00:02:27,846
is a part of this great miracle.

14
00:02:27,929 --> 00:02:31,725
A rebirth, just like
the sea and the sky.

15
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:34,894
We're here because
someone wanted us to be.

16
00:02:34,978 --> 00:02:35,687
[SHIMA]
Kodai?

17
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:36,980
[gasps]

18
00:02:37,063 --> 00:02:37,897
What's wrong?

19
00:02:37,981 --> 00:02:40,233
Uh, nothing.

20
00:02:40,316 --> 00:02:41,943
Are you sure? You seem kinda--

21
00:02:42,027 --> 00:02:44,029
It's just been a while
since I've seen you.

22
00:02:44,112 --> 00:02:45,780
It's a relief.

23
00:02:45,864 --> 00:02:46,990
[gasps]

24
00:02:53,788 --> 00:02:55,248
[SHIMA]
It's true, isn't it?

25
00:02:55,331 --> 00:02:56,875
She's lost all her memories?

26
00:02:56,958 --> 00:03:00,837
[KODAI] Not exactly. She only
lost the last four years.

27
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:03,673
But she'll remember,
soon enough.

28
00:03:24,069 --> 00:03:25,987
There you are, <i>Ginga</i> Team.

29
00:03:26,071 --> 00:03:29,449
Hey, the old <i>Antares</i> crew.
Haven't seen you guys in ages.

30
00:03:29,532 --> 00:03:32,369
Welcome to our humble
abode, the <i>Yamato</i> .

31
00:03:33,953 --> 00:03:35,580
I can't believe everyone
in the Air Corps

32
00:03:35,663 --> 00:03:37,415
managed to survive
that situation.

33
00:03:37,499 --> 00:03:38,458
It's a miracle.

34
00:03:38,541 --> 00:03:40,293
So how was it? The <i>Ginga</i> ?

35
00:03:40,377 --> 00:03:44,130
Well, it's practically unmanned,
so no real place for me there.

36
00:03:44,214 --> 00:03:47,008
But how were things for you?
That torpedo bomber?

37
00:03:47,092 --> 00:03:48,968
[SAWAMURA]
I gotta say, it was awesome!

38
00:03:49,052 --> 00:03:52,013
Its turning radius is super
short, and the revolving turrets

39
00:03:52,097 --> 00:03:55,350
have a low rate of movement,
so it's really easy to operate.

40
00:03:55,433 --> 00:03:57,102
Was a bit of
a tight fit, though.

41
00:03:57,185 --> 00:03:59,270
Sounds like you'll
be a dedicated gunner.

42
00:03:59,354 --> 00:04:00,146
Huh?!

43
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:03,608
So, Shino, where's Captain Kato?

44
00:04:03,692 --> 00:04:04,651
[SHINOHARA]
Hm.

45
00:04:04,734 --> 00:04:07,362
I think, since we're
all here now...

46
00:04:07,445 --> 00:04:09,364
...we should go see him.

47
00:04:39,185 --> 00:04:41,479
[SAKI] We've lost the
Cosmo Reverse System,

48
00:04:41,563 --> 00:04:43,565
and Command AI is gone, too.

49
00:04:43,648 --> 00:04:47,152
At present, carrying out
the G Plan would be difficult.

50
00:04:47,235 --> 00:04:49,904
So, that said, we'll
transfer our equipment

51
00:04:49,988 --> 00:04:51,865
and remain on standby.

52
00:04:51,948 --> 00:04:52,907
We'll await orders.

53
00:04:52,991 --> 00:04:55,744
That's enough, Captain Todo.

54
00:04:55,827 --> 00:04:57,245
I have a lot of questions

55
00:04:57,328 --> 00:05:00,874
about how the Command AI was
damaged, among other things.

56
00:05:00,957 --> 00:05:02,751
But it's wartime.

57
00:05:02,834 --> 00:05:06,421
Let's leave the decisions to
the commanders in the field.

58
00:05:09,007 --> 00:05:10,258
[gasps]

59
00:05:10,342 --> 00:05:12,719
Commander Todo, thank you.

60
00:05:12,802 --> 00:05:14,220
[TODO]
Look.

61
00:05:14,304 --> 00:05:16,890
Earth will soon be facing down
a fight for the mainland.

62
00:05:16,973 --> 00:05:21,019
This may be the last time that
you and I can talk like this.

63
00:05:22,771 --> 00:05:25,398
[TODO] I wasn't able
to do anything for you.

64
00:05:26,691 --> 00:05:30,403
And so, if we live to
meet again someday...

65
00:05:31,488 --> 00:05:32,947
Commander.

66
00:05:34,616 --> 00:05:36,159
[SAKI]
Dad, wait!

67
00:05:36,242 --> 00:05:37,827
I wanted to tell you,

68
00:05:37,911 --> 00:05:40,872
I think I understand
Mom better now.

69
00:05:43,375 --> 00:05:46,044
[SAKI] The only reason humans
tend to be so idealistic

70
00:05:46,127 --> 00:05:49,047
in the first place, is because
of our fragile hearts.

71
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:50,965
They're so easily broken.

72
00:05:51,049 --> 00:05:52,801
And if they ever hold us back,

73
00:05:52,884 --> 00:05:55,011
then we're better
off without them.

74
00:05:55,095 --> 00:05:58,431
At least, that's what
I've always believed.

75
00:05:58,515 --> 00:05:59,724
But now...

76
00:05:59,808 --> 00:06:01,101
Fate can be odd.

77
00:06:01,184 --> 00:06:03,853
To think you'd be
reunited on Terezart.

78
00:06:03,937 --> 00:06:06,272
[KEYMAN]
My uncle--or, Desler, I mean,

79
00:06:06,356 --> 00:06:09,442
is more than a
power-crazed dictator.

80
00:06:09,526 --> 00:06:12,737
Gamilas is reaching the end
of its life as a planet.

81
00:06:12,821 --> 00:06:14,656
He had to carry that secret

82
00:06:14,739 --> 00:06:18,243
and worry about his
people all his life.

83
00:06:18,326 --> 00:06:20,078
Even if I'd just
learned that much,

84
00:06:20,161 --> 00:06:21,413
this mission would still be...

85
00:06:21,496 --> 00:06:22,747
[BURRELL]
...a happy one.

86
00:06:22,831 --> 00:06:24,374
[gasps]

87
00:06:29,254 --> 00:06:30,797
[BURRELL]
Are you going?

88
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,674
[KEYMAN]
I would like your permission.

89
00:06:32,757 --> 00:06:35,260
[BURRELL] This is a time
of trial for Gamilas.

90
00:06:35,343 --> 00:06:37,971
We must find a new home
with the same environment

91
00:06:38,054 --> 00:06:40,890
and relocate all our
people there very quickly.

92
00:06:40,974 --> 00:06:43,643
I hate to lose such a capable
worker who could assist me

93
00:06:43,727 --> 00:06:46,104
with a project this massive.

94
00:06:46,187 --> 00:06:48,940
But how could I say no
to a look like that?

95
00:06:49,024 --> 00:06:51,192
There's something quite
different about you, Klaus.

96
00:06:51,276 --> 00:06:52,485
Have you fallen in love?

97
00:06:52,569 --> 00:06:53,737
[gasps]

98
00:06:55,405 --> 00:06:57,365
[SAKI]
I've figured it out.

99
00:06:57,449 --> 00:06:59,743
Our tender hearts are an asset.

100
00:06:59,826 --> 00:07:03,329
They're what make us human.

101
00:07:03,413 --> 00:07:05,540
They're inconstant
and uncertain,

102
00:07:05,623 --> 00:07:07,417
but they drive us
to do the right thing,

103
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:09,794
to follow those tender feelings.

104
00:07:09,878 --> 00:07:11,713
I've salvaged every
part of the <i>Ginga</i> .

105
00:07:11,796 --> 00:07:13,923
That we'd be able
to use, anyway.

106
00:07:14,924 --> 00:07:18,553
I hope you're about to say
I'm the part we could use most.

107
00:07:18,636 --> 00:07:20,221
But you're not
going to, are you?

108
00:07:20,305 --> 00:07:22,349
You know I can't take you.

109
00:07:22,432 --> 00:07:23,850
[YAMAZAKI]
Please, old man.

110
00:07:23,933 --> 00:07:25,810
You've got so much experience.

111
00:07:25,894 --> 00:07:27,937
And these young kids
still have a lot to learn.

112
00:07:28,021 --> 00:07:30,065
Who else could teach them?

113
00:07:31,232 --> 00:07:35,945
I know you'll turn them into
good engineers, Yamazaki.

114
00:07:36,029 --> 00:07:38,239
[SAKI]
That is the essence of humanity,

115
00:07:38,323 --> 00:07:40,533
something machines lack.

116
00:07:40,617 --> 00:07:42,786
We're so strong
that occasionally,

117
00:07:42,869 --> 00:07:44,662
we even destroy ourselves.

118
00:07:44,746 --> 00:07:50,043
It's an awesome source of power,
given only to the human race.

119
00:07:50,126 --> 00:07:54,673
Hijikata. I just wanted to
tell you that you were right.

120
00:07:54,756 --> 00:07:56,841
The Wave Motion Gun Fleet.

121
00:07:56,925 --> 00:08:00,637
If we rely on power alone,
then in the end...

122
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,473
I was only repeating something
I learned from Okita.

123
00:08:03,556 --> 00:08:06,726
But honestly, you're the one
who had your eyes on the future,

124
00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:08,353
on Earth's survival.

125
00:08:08,436 --> 00:08:10,814
You're wrong. I didn't
see the future at all.

126
00:08:10,897 --> 00:08:12,482
That battle begins now.

127
00:08:12,565 --> 00:08:14,859
The battle for the
survival of all humanity.

128
00:08:14,943 --> 00:08:16,820
I feel certain that our
most difficult tests

129
00:08:16,903 --> 00:08:18,697
have only just begun.

130
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:20,699
I don't just mean you and me,

131
00:08:20,782 --> 00:08:23,410
but the entirety
of the human race.

132
00:08:37,173 --> 00:08:40,677
[SAKI]
That's all I want, to be human.

No matter what awful
fate may await us,

[SANADA] The enemy's defense
is proving overwhelming.

160
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:03,551
And now that we've lost

161
00:10:03,635 --> 00:10:05,929
the <i>Ginga</i> 's Wave Motion
Core Amplification System,

162
00:10:06,012 --> 00:10:07,430
it cannot be breached.

163
00:10:07,514 --> 00:10:10,767
Not by Earth, Gamilas,
or the two together.

164
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:11,685
There is a way.

165
00:10:11,768 --> 00:10:13,645
The Transit Wave Motion Gun.

166
00:10:13,728 --> 00:10:15,021
That's right.

167
00:10:15,105 --> 00:10:16,815
If we use the Transit
Wave Motion Gun,

168
00:10:16,898 --> 00:10:18,108
we just might be able
to break through

169
00:10:18,191 --> 00:10:20,527
the <i>Comet City</i> 's Defense field.

170
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:23,947
We aim for this specific point
and create an opening there.

171
00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:26,741
That's how we can get
close to the enemy.

172
00:10:26,825 --> 00:10:28,326
Then, a suicide squad will head

173
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:30,787
for the Achilles
Heel of Gatlantis.

174
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:33,456
The throne from which
Emperor Zworder rules.

175
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:36,918
And that's where it is: Golem.

176
00:10:37,002 --> 00:10:38,670
Just before she lost
consciousness,

177
00:10:38,753 --> 00:10:41,798
Toko Katsuragi revealed
that secret to us.

178
00:10:41,881 --> 00:10:44,342
Then, we will activate
Golem and make it sing,

179
00:10:44,426 --> 00:10:47,721
and bury every last damn
Gatlantean in one fell swoop.

180
00:10:47,804 --> 00:10:49,180
Kill them all?

181
00:10:49,264 --> 00:10:52,642
They're not human, remember?
I wouldn't let it bug you.

182
00:10:52,726 --> 00:10:54,602
[KODAI]
One more time.

183
00:10:54,686 --> 00:10:56,938
I think that we should
at least attempt to talk

184
00:10:57,022 --> 00:10:59,024
with Zworder one more time.

185
00:11:00,984 --> 00:11:02,152
Kodai.

186
00:11:02,235 --> 00:11:04,070
If we stop once we occupy Golem

187
00:11:04,154 --> 00:11:05,989
and use that to
negotiate with Zworder--

188
00:11:06,072 --> 00:11:07,240
Don't be naive!

189
00:11:07,323 --> 00:11:08,700
Have you already
forgotten the crimes

190
00:11:08,783 --> 00:11:10,702
Gatlantis committed against us?

191
00:11:10,785 --> 00:11:12,829
I haven't forgotten.

192
00:11:12,912 --> 00:11:15,832
And yet, I know his past now.

193
00:11:15,915 --> 00:11:17,334
I've seen what made
Zworder this way

194
00:11:17,417 --> 00:11:19,169
and it's changed things.

195
00:11:20,962 --> 00:11:23,089
I know it won't be
easy to persuade him.

196
00:11:23,173 --> 00:11:26,760
A man who's lived in
despair for 1,000 years.

197
00:11:26,843 --> 00:11:28,386
Even so...

198
00:11:32,182 --> 00:11:34,392
Very well.

199
00:11:34,476 --> 00:11:37,479
If you see an
opportunity, take it.

200
00:11:37,562 --> 00:11:40,273
But also, know when
it's time to give up.

201
00:11:40,357 --> 00:11:41,608
Sir.

202
00:11:49,574 --> 00:11:51,701
Are you okay?

203
00:11:51,785 --> 00:11:55,121
[YUKI]
Why'd he do that?

204
00:11:55,205 --> 00:11:58,583
He faced such opposition,
but still persisted.

205
00:11:58,667 --> 00:12:01,461
He's just that kind of guy.

206
00:12:01,544 --> 00:12:05,507
That's Kodai for you.
The one you knew and loved.

207
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:08,677
To be honest, I'd never seen
anyone as in love as you two.

208
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:10,345
It was incredible.

209
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:15,141
Remember that. I hope it helps.

210
00:12:18,186 --> 00:12:19,437
What'd you say?

211
00:12:19,521 --> 00:12:22,399
The Space Cavalry is being
taken off the mission.

212
00:12:22,482 --> 00:12:24,818
Those are the captain's orders.

213
00:12:24,901 --> 00:12:26,236
Why, old man?

214
00:12:26,319 --> 00:12:27,570
Saito, relax!

215
00:12:27,654 --> 00:12:30,198
I'm afraid Toko Katsuragi
wasn't the only spy

216
00:12:30,281 --> 00:12:31,950
on this ship after all,

217
00:12:32,033 --> 00:12:35,495
and Kato's testimony
proves as much.

218
00:12:35,578 --> 00:12:37,956
The most likely suspect
is in the Space Cavalry

219
00:12:38,039 --> 00:12:41,001
that we brought onboard
at the 11th planet.

220
00:12:41,084 --> 00:12:43,420
We'll have to put
all our chips on you.

221
00:12:43,503 --> 00:12:44,504
[NAGAKURA]
Huh?

222
00:12:44,587 --> 00:12:46,715
You owe me, Commander.

223
00:12:50,927 --> 00:12:52,012
[gasps]

224
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:54,014
If Toko happens to
regain consciousness,

225
00:12:54,097 --> 00:12:56,558
then we'll question her, but...

226
00:12:56,641 --> 00:12:58,143
What can we do?

227
00:12:58,226 --> 00:13:01,354
How can we cut the strings that
could still be connecting them?

228
00:13:01,438 --> 00:13:04,816
Gamilas is keeping Gatlantean
prisoners, aren't they?

229
00:13:04,899 --> 00:13:08,486
You can stop them all from
self-destructing, right?

230
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:12,323
[KEYMAN]
Yes, but there's only one way.

231
00:13:30,592 --> 00:13:32,177
Wait, is that...?

232
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:33,928
[gasps]

233
00:13:34,012 --> 00:13:35,597
Captain Hijikata!

234
00:13:50,195 --> 00:13:52,697
[MIL] When the destruction
of the <i>Yamato</i> is confirmed,

235
00:13:52,781 --> 00:13:56,701
we will arrange for a new place
for the Gamilans to move.

236
00:13:56,785 --> 00:13:58,661
A planet that is
atmospherically similar

237
00:13:58,745 --> 00:14:00,789
to your dying home world.

238
00:14:00,872 --> 00:14:02,832
While the universe may be vast,

239
00:14:02,916 --> 00:14:07,128
we of Gatlantis are the
only ones who can help you.

240
00:14:21,434 --> 00:14:23,019
Are you sure about this, Keyman?

241
00:14:23,103 --> 00:14:26,064
I don't see anything. Perimeter
monitoring shows nothing.

242
00:14:26,147 --> 00:14:31,111
I've no doubt. It was just
a glimpse, but I saw it.

243
00:14:31,194 --> 00:14:33,863
This is a man who claims to
value honor above all else.

244
00:14:33,947 --> 00:14:37,242
Using a move that amounts
to a sneak attack.

245
00:14:37,325 --> 00:14:39,411
Desler must mean business.

246
00:14:43,707 --> 00:14:46,126
We will eliminate the
threat to our safety!

247
00:14:46,209 --> 00:14:48,962
All ships, prepare to warp now!

248
00:14:50,922 --> 00:14:54,634
[DESLER]
<i>Yamato</i> . The great harmony.

249
00:14:54,718 --> 00:14:57,929
High ideals are admirable.

250
00:14:58,013 --> 00:15:02,392
And yet, idealism on
its own will save nothing.

251
00:15:07,188 --> 00:15:09,065
[DESLER] If you possess
the strength it would take

252
00:15:09,149 --> 00:15:12,694
to reshape reality
according to your ideals,

253
00:15:12,777 --> 00:15:17,115
then by all means,
come defeat me, Ranhalt.

254
00:15:24,497 --> 00:15:25,915
Did we succeed?

255
00:15:31,463 --> 00:15:32,797
They're so close!

256
00:15:32,881 --> 00:15:36,051
Core ship, start
emergency purge.

257
00:15:39,137 --> 00:15:40,430
[NANBU]
Enemy ship has separated!

258
00:15:40,513 --> 00:15:42,807
[SHIMA]
What? Prepare reverse thrusters!

259
00:15:42,891 --> 00:15:46,478
[HIJIKATA] No, keep going!
Ram us in, quickly!

260
00:16:00,283 --> 00:16:01,618
[SAIJO]
No enemies in sight!

261
00:16:01,701 --> 00:16:03,995
Only the <i>Neu Desular</i> is visible!

262
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:07,332
[NANBU] No engine heat detected
from the separated object!

263
00:16:07,415 --> 00:16:10,251
[SAITO] Space Cavalry Team
Alpha, preparing to launch!

264
00:16:10,335 --> 00:16:12,045
[HIJIKATA]
All crew, arm yourselves!

265
00:16:12,128 --> 00:16:14,005
Prepare for hand-to-hand combat!

266
00:16:14,089 --> 00:16:16,466
Chief Tactical Officer Kodai
will lead Team Bravo

267
00:16:16,549 --> 00:16:18,259
to infiltrate the enemy ship!

268
00:16:18,343 --> 00:16:20,887
Lieutenant Keyman will be
in charge of the timing!

269
00:16:20,970 --> 00:16:23,932
Kodai, no.

270
00:16:24,015 --> 00:16:25,934
[NANBU]
No signs of movement onboard.

271
00:16:26,017 --> 00:16:29,229
It seems to be
unmanned, but why?

272
00:16:29,312 --> 00:16:30,689
[SAIJO] Interference with
Wave Motion Shield

273
00:16:30,772 --> 00:16:32,107
detected at ship's rear!

274
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:33,400
[gasps]

275
00:16:34,693 --> 00:16:36,611
[SAIJO] Part of the Wave
Motion Shield is down!

276
00:16:36,695 --> 00:16:38,196
They're breaking through!

277
00:16:39,531 --> 00:16:41,116
[SANADA] They've broken
through our armor.

278
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:44,452
Multiple unmanned Gatlantean
weapons are infiltrating!

279
00:16:44,536 --> 00:16:46,955
Team Alpha, focus on
defending the ship!

280
00:16:47,038 --> 00:16:48,873
[SAIJO]
In the front now, too!

281
00:16:50,083 --> 00:16:52,293
[MIL]
So, you removed the core vessel.

282
00:16:52,377 --> 00:16:54,379
In doing so, you halted
the <i>Yamato</i> 's movements

283
00:16:54,462 --> 00:16:56,339
after they charged.

284
00:16:56,423 --> 00:16:59,884
For a spur-of-the-moment
maneuvering decision, stellar.

285
00:16:59,968 --> 00:17:01,177
It's as if you knew
that the <i>Yamato</i>

286
00:17:01,261 --> 00:17:03,680
would come toward us
even before it did.

287
00:17:03,763 --> 00:17:07,392
I'm not surprised your
kind doesn't understand it.

288
00:17:07,475 --> 00:17:08,727
[chuckles]

289
00:17:08,810 --> 00:17:10,228
My nephew's with them.

290
00:17:10,311 --> 00:17:13,440
And family members often
think in similar ways.

291
00:17:15,650 --> 00:17:16,735
Turn left at the corner,

292
00:17:16,818 --> 00:17:18,028
and remember, their
defenses are thick!

293
00:17:18,111 --> 00:17:19,821
Roger that, let's move!

294
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:37,464
[HIJIKATA] What about the
enemies inside the ship?

295
00:17:37,547 --> 00:17:38,673
[SANADA]
They're dwindling.

296
00:17:38,757 --> 00:17:40,467
It appears as though
Commander Saito's Team

297
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:42,177
is giving them a good fight.

298
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:43,636
[KURATA]
Luring them in worked!

299
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:45,096
They're all yours now, Nagakura!

300
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:47,015
[NAGAKURA] All right!
Just leave the rest to me!

301
00:17:47,098 --> 00:17:48,350
[SAITO]
One last thing!

302
00:17:48,433 --> 00:17:50,727
Once they've been caught,
go for the elbows first!

303
00:17:50,810 --> 00:17:51,936
[NAGAKURA]
Roger!

304
00:17:54,439 --> 00:17:56,107
[SAITO]
Take that!

305
00:17:58,777 --> 00:18:02,447
[yells]

306
00:18:05,492 --> 00:18:06,618
[NAGAKURA]
Commander!

307
00:18:10,789 --> 00:18:14,084
[SAITO]
Nagakura! Uh!

308
00:18:14,167 --> 00:18:15,752
It's no good.

309
00:18:20,298 --> 00:18:21,841
[NAGAKURA]
Commander! What are you doing?

310
00:18:21,925 --> 00:18:22,967
Beats me!

311
00:18:23,051 --> 00:18:24,052
[gasps]

312
00:18:42,028 --> 00:18:44,447
[ZWORDER]
Love is necessary.

313
00:18:44,531 --> 00:18:47,575
Yes, I have no doubt about that.

314
00:18:47,659 --> 00:18:52,247
It's all so empty.
You shall know despair.

315
00:18:52,330 --> 00:18:57,460
What's that voice?
Could it be... me?

316
00:19:04,551 --> 00:19:07,178
Crying? Him?

317
00:19:13,977 --> 00:19:18,481
It's me... but why?

318
00:19:18,565 --> 00:19:23,069
Please, no. How could I?

319
00:19:27,490 --> 00:19:29,075
[ZWORDER] Without knowing
that you are only

320
00:19:29,159 --> 00:19:32,495
the playthings of fate,
you will go on killing,

321
00:19:32,579 --> 00:19:34,748
and being killed, yourselves.

322
00:19:34,831 --> 00:19:37,250
There'll be no end to it.

323
00:19:37,334 --> 00:19:39,377
You will know despair.

324
00:19:39,461 --> 00:19:43,048
And when it's finally over,
all will be destroyed.

325
00:19:43,131 --> 00:19:47,635
It's human. That drive
to wreak destruction.

326
00:19:49,012 --> 00:19:53,600
Yes, indeed.
Love is a necessary piece.

327
00:19:53,683 --> 00:19:57,520
Not the sort of love that has
the power to save lives.

328
00:19:57,604 --> 00:19:59,689
Nor a love that
can be wiped away

329
00:19:59,773 --> 00:20:02,317
with just a trick of memory.

330
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:07,197
No, a love that will put
an end to all suffering.

331
00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:10,658
But it can only do so
by bringing about death,

332
00:20:10,742 --> 00:20:13,995
and with it, eternal
rest to all humans.

333
00:20:14,079 --> 00:20:17,415
There is no greater
love in the universe.

334
00:20:26,383 --> 00:20:29,719
So, turns out, in the end, they
were nothing but puppets?

335
00:20:29,803 --> 00:20:31,721
Have they gotten into
the control room?

336
00:20:31,805 --> 00:20:33,139
They're just a few measly rats,

337
00:20:33,223 --> 00:20:35,850
why are you taking so long
to exterminate them?

338
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:39,312
Leader, Master Ranhalt
is deeply familiar

339
00:20:39,396 --> 00:20:42,107
with the layout of that ship
and poses a great threat.

340
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:44,401
I'm aware of your orders
that he not be touched,

341
00:20:44,484 --> 00:20:46,695
but the situation is
becoming increasingly dire.

342
00:20:46,778 --> 00:20:49,698
Still, I do not recall
rescinding my original order.

343
00:20:49,781 --> 00:20:52,784
Supreme Leader, at this rate,
your own life is in danger.

344
00:20:52,867 --> 00:20:54,786
I insist on sending
a rescue team--

345
00:20:57,288 --> 00:20:59,207
You arrived sooner
than I expected.

346
00:20:59,290 --> 00:21:02,252
Leader, stop the
fighting at once.

347
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:03,670
In order to save Gamilas,

348
00:21:03,753 --> 00:21:06,131
you were willing
to cling to Gatlantis.

349
00:21:06,214 --> 00:21:09,009
Isn't that right?

350
00:21:09,092 --> 00:21:12,929
Tell me, why would you send out
a signal to me like you did?

351
00:21:13,013 --> 00:21:14,431
[DESLER]
Hm.

352
00:21:14,514 --> 00:21:16,057
Do you know Zworder's goal?

353
00:21:16,141 --> 00:21:19,060
It is the extermination
of all humanoid life.

354
00:21:19,144 --> 00:21:21,187
Even if Gamilas does
keep their word,

355
00:21:21,271 --> 00:21:24,441
the relationship
is irreconcilable.

356
00:21:24,524 --> 00:21:26,860
You're keeping with
the wrong ally,

357
00:21:26,943 --> 00:21:29,362
and deep down, you know that
it's the truth, which is why--

358
00:21:29,446 --> 00:21:30,989
[DESLER]
Don't deceive yourself.

359
00:21:31,072 --> 00:21:33,199
You would make the same
choice in my position,

360
00:21:33,283 --> 00:21:35,076
but you've let your
time on the <i>Yamato</i>

361
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,703
cloud your judgement.

362
00:21:36,786 --> 00:21:38,163
Uncle.

363
00:21:41,499 --> 00:21:42,751
[DESLER]
Ranhalt.

364
00:21:42,834 --> 00:21:44,210
Don't move.

365
00:21:46,129 --> 00:21:47,714
Supreme Leader!

366
00:21:58,767 --> 00:22:02,729
Now, Klaus Keyman,
assassinate Desler.

367
00:22:02,812 --> 00:22:05,231
If you do, then I promise
that I will save

368
00:22:05,315 --> 00:22:07,567
both Earth and Gamilas.

369
00:22:09,569 --> 00:22:12,155
After all, for clones
such as ourselves,

370
00:22:12,238 --> 00:22:14,908
time's of no
consequence, anyway.

371
00:22:14,991 --> 00:22:17,952
In order to truly exterminate
every last humanoid,

372
00:22:18,036 --> 00:22:20,455
it could take tens
of thousands of years.

373
00:22:20,538 --> 00:22:21,664
[gasps]

374
00:22:21,748 --> 00:22:24,250
[MIL]
A 10,000-year reprieve.

375
00:22:24,334 --> 00:22:29,547
It could be yours if
you do as you're told.

376
00:22:29,631 --> 00:22:35,637
Now, kill Desler and exterminate
the love in your heart!

377
00:25:49,164 --> 00:25:52,459
[MIL] Now, then, young
Desler, choose your fate.

378
00:25:52,542 --> 00:25:53,293
Will you kill him?

379
00:25:53,376 --> 00:25:54,961
[DESLER]
Shoot me, Ranhalt.

380
00:25:55,045 --> 00:25:57,213
[SAITO] Dying isn't the
most difficult thing

381
00:25:57,297 --> 00:25:58,631
that people have to face.

382
00:25:58,715 --> 00:26:00,467
[MIL]
How can you not make a choice?

383
00:26:00,550 --> 00:26:02,677
[KODAI] No, Keyman!
You can't make a choice!

384
00:26:02,761 --> 00:26:03,803
[KEYMAN]
Kodai!
