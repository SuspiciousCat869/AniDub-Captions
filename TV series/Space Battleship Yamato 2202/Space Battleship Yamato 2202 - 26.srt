[SERIZAWA]
Take in the view.

162
00:10:50,598 --> 00:10:54,269
Look at our city that
has recovered so much.

163
00:10:54,352 --> 00:10:57,939
Energy, supplies,
military power.

164

We cannot afford to lose any
of these in the days to come.

Only one thing supports them,
and that's the time fault.

166

What do you think would
happen to our resources

167

dimensional collapse?

Do not be swayed by impractical
appeals to emotion.

169

Think only of our greater
plans for the Earth.

You're not gonna stay?

Right, let's get busy.

You know, I envy you people.

181
00:11:51,993 --> 00:11:55,121
[SANADA] I am here today to
talk to you about a certain man.

182
00:11:56,998 --> 00:11:58,458
Now, he wasn't special.

183
00:11:58,541 --> 00:12:00,960
He was just a regular guy.

184
00:12:01,044 --> 00:12:02,212
He loved people.

185
00:12:02,295 --> 00:12:05,215
Believed in the
society they created.

186
00:12:05,298 --> 00:12:07,676
The time came when
the Earth was pushed

187
00:12:07,759 --> 00:12:09,052
to the precipice of ruin,

188
00:12:09,135 --> 00:12:12,806
and he joined the great
expedition to Iscandar.

189
00:12:12,889 --> 00:12:14,724
When he finally returned,

190
00:12:14,808 --> 00:12:18,186
just like all of you here,
he worked himself to the bone

191
00:12:18,269 --> 00:12:21,731
for the sole purpose of
restoring the Earth.

192
00:12:21,815 --> 00:12:24,693
This man wished for one
thing above all else.

193
00:12:24,776 --> 00:12:28,321
That we would be able to
keep our promise to Iscandar.

194
00:12:28,405 --> 00:12:31,408
But after the war,
the Earth was in a position

195
00:12:31,491 --> 00:12:33,868
which would no longer
allow for that.

196
00:12:33,952 --> 00:12:35,495
He was betrayed.

197
00:12:35,578 --> 00:12:38,790
That undoubtedly must
have been what he felt.

198
00:12:38,873 --> 00:12:42,335
That's why, when we received
the signal from Terezart,

199
00:12:42,419 --> 00:12:45,964
he left the Earth fully
prepared to commit treason.

200
00:12:46,047 --> 00:12:48,925
It was his wish to contribute
to peace in the universe

201
00:12:49,009 --> 00:12:52,262
as an Earthling,
no matter the cost.

202
00:12:52,345 --> 00:12:56,141
But his choice came
with grave consequences.

203
00:12:56,224 --> 00:12:59,060
In his quest for peace,
he had to pull the trigger

204
00:12:59,144 --> 00:13:01,980
on the Wave Motion Gun
more than anyone.

205
00:13:02,063 --> 00:13:05,859
Whether it was to live,
or to protect,

206
00:13:05,942 --> 00:13:08,945
he betrayed his own
heart with every pull.

207
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:12,699
[SANADA]
He felt hesitation, naturally.

208
00:13:12,782 --> 00:13:15,118
He always pled
for reconciliation,

209
00:13:15,201 --> 00:13:17,662
and at times he stood in
front of the enemy's gun,

210
00:13:17,746 --> 00:13:21,583
in the hopes that sacrifice
might save the rest of us.

211
00:13:21,666 --> 00:13:25,295
Try as he might,
it all worked against him.

212
00:13:25,378 --> 00:13:28,214
In a twist of irony,
this ordinary man would have to

213
00:13:28,298 --> 00:13:31,634
make his own life
a weapon in the end.

214
00:13:31,718 --> 00:13:33,595
The cost of his life
saved the Earth,

215
00:13:33,678 --> 00:13:36,431
but we only know
this in hindsight.

216
00:13:36,514 --> 00:13:40,143
This man, and Yuki Mori,
a woman who loved him

217
00:13:40,226 --> 00:13:42,270
and made the same
sacrifice he did,

218
00:13:42,354 --> 00:13:46,066
you should resist the urge
to call them heroes.

219
00:13:46,149 --> 00:13:48,568
Because he is you!

220
00:13:48,651 --> 00:13:51,404
Forsaken by his hopes
and the future he wanted,

221
00:13:51,488 --> 00:13:55,283
tortured by the feeling that he
lost something every single day.

222
00:13:55,367 --> 00:13:58,370
In order to press on
and fulfill his duty,

223
00:13:58,453 --> 00:14:01,331
he grew accustomed to
that constant suffering,

224
00:14:01,414 --> 00:14:05,210
ultimately losing sight
of the man he used to be.

225
00:14:05,293 --> 00:14:08,922
He himself predicted that
the selfishness of yesterday

226
00:14:09,005 --> 00:14:12,425
and the compromises of today
would crush the future,

227
00:14:12,509 --> 00:14:14,010
yet he kept walking
down the road

228
00:14:14,094 --> 00:14:16,388
without knowing
where it would go.

229
00:14:16,471 --> 00:14:18,932
He was a man among
many nameless people.

230
00:14:19,015 --> 00:14:21,601
Trying his best to
live in this harsh era.

231
00:14:21,685 --> 00:14:24,187
He is you, and he is me.

232
00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:26,272
We are all the same.

233
00:14:26,356 --> 00:14:31,152
My goal is not to make
you feel inferior.

234
00:14:31,236 --> 00:14:34,447
So if you're thinking that
these are heroes worth saving

235
00:14:34,531 --> 00:14:37,951
no matter what it might cost,
then you are mistaken.

236
00:14:38,034 --> 00:14:40,745
But, if you believe
that they're worth saving

237
00:14:40,829 --> 00:14:44,082
because you will also be
saving yourself in some way...

238
00:14:44,165 --> 00:14:46,751
If, after making
this foolish choice,

239
00:14:46,835 --> 00:14:49,212
you believe we can
reclaim the original future

240
00:14:49,295 --> 00:14:51,381
that we all deserve,

241
00:14:51,464 --> 00:14:53,883
then please,
make the right choice.

242
00:14:53,967 --> 00:14:56,219
Cast your vote to save them.

by hollow speeches

convenience, or efficiency.

Listen to your heart.

Because the heart is our home.

our future exists.

00:24:14,444 --> 00:24:15,987
But the breath of the cosmos

00:24:16,071 --> 00:24:18,948
that is passed
from life to life...

321
00:24:20,283 --> 00:24:24,496
[OKITA] ...is a cycle
that will never end.
