00:01:59,442 --> 00:02:00,902
[SANADA]
Do you remember the first time

2
00:02:00,985 --> 00:02:04,531
Captain Okita collapsed and I
was forced to take command?

3
00:02:04,614 --> 00:02:05,865
[KODAI]
Yes.

4
00:02:05,949 --> 00:02:08,535
[SANADA] In that moment,
when every second counted,

5
00:02:08,618 --> 00:02:10,745
I was so focused
on acting rationally

6
00:02:10,829 --> 00:02:13,123
that I let eight
crewmembers die.

7
00:02:13,206 --> 00:02:14,624
[KODAI]
XO...

8
00:02:14,708 --> 00:02:18,169
[SANADA] Rational thought is
by far our greatest weapon.

9
00:02:18,253 --> 00:02:22,590
But even it has its limits,
wouldn't you agree?

10
00:02:22,674 --> 00:02:24,592
[KODAI]
That's, uh...

11
00:02:24,676 --> 00:02:25,969
[SANADA]
Like Captain Okita showed

12
00:02:26,052 --> 00:02:28,596
with his swift decisiveness,
in the heat of battle

13
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,140
a commander needs the ability

14
00:02:30,223 --> 00:02:34,936
to think in a way that
transcends rationality.

15
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:37,689
Tactical Commander Kodai,
as of now,

16
00:02:37,772 --> 00:02:40,734
I am giving you full command
of the <i>Yamato</i> on this voyage.

17
00:02:40,817 --> 00:02:41,860
[gasps]

18
00:02:41,943 --> 00:02:44,279
I want you to serve
as Acting Captain.

19
00:02:44,362 --> 00:02:47,949
You're the best man for
the job. You've proven that.

20
00:03:22,067 --> 00:03:23,401
It's time.

21
00:03:23,485 --> 00:03:25,403
Our strike team will soon
have the dock surrounded.

22
00:03:25,487 --> 00:03:28,281
In the worst-case scenario,
if they have mutinous intent

23
00:03:28,365 --> 00:03:30,617
and lock themselves
inside the <i>Yamato</i>

24
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:32,702
we'll keep them pinned down.

25
00:03:39,042 --> 00:03:42,462
[LEADER 4A] At location. Unable
to confirm visual on <i>Yamato.</i>

[SERIZAWA] What?! But it
shows here on our screen.

27
00:03:45,006 --> 00:03:46,633
I'm looking right at it!

28
00:03:46,716 --> 00:03:48,677
They must have tampered
with the cameras.

29
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50,178
They blinded us!

30
00:03:50,261 --> 00:03:51,930
What about secondary sensors?

31
00:03:52,013 --> 00:03:55,058
They didn't just vanish
into thin air, find them!

32
00:03:55,141 --> 00:03:56,142
[SOLDIER 4A]
No heat signature,

33
00:03:56,226 --> 00:03:59,187
and no sign of the
ship leaving port.

34
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:00,647
They've gone under.

35
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:02,440
What was that, sir?

36
00:04:02,524 --> 00:04:07,278
The old underground city--the
dock is still connected to it.

37
00:04:07,362 --> 00:04:09,447
Get me a visual on
the lower levels, now!

[SERIZAWA growls]
They're making fools of us.

40
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:17,706
Those bastards.

41
00:04:17,789 --> 00:04:20,375
Mind your temper, Admiral.

42
00:04:20,458 --> 00:04:23,753
These are still the heroes
who saved the Earth.

43
00:04:33,805 --> 00:04:35,223
Captain Okita.

44
00:04:35,306 --> 00:04:39,477
I have no doubts about making
this voyage, but even so,

45
00:04:39,561 --> 00:04:42,063
I'm scared...
Scared of myself...

46
00:04:42,147 --> 00:04:43,815
That I might be the one
who gives the order

47
00:04:43,898 --> 00:04:47,277
to use the Wave Motion Gun.

48
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:51,573
If I wanted to, I could cut
the circuit now and seal it off.

49
00:04:51,656 --> 00:04:54,409
If I truly object to
Earth's military policies,

50
00:04:54,492 --> 00:04:56,327
that's the right thing to do.

51
00:04:56,411 --> 00:04:58,830
But still, if any of
the crew were to die

52
00:04:58,913 --> 00:05:03,126
as a result of not having it,
well what then?

53
00:05:03,209 --> 00:05:06,004
How do I make that choice?

What?! That ship?

00:05:34,282 --> 00:05:38,078
We retired it.
Who's operating it?

62

They're really doing it.

63
00:05:59,766 --> 00:06:00,975
[KODAI]
We should go!

No matter who it is,
or how far away they are!

Was this the only way, Kodai?

There'll be no turning back.
Not from this.

This way! Get to the lifts!

68
00:06:29,295 --> 00:06:32,215
They've descended into the
abandoned underground city.

69
00:06:32,298 --> 00:06:35,260
Send another unit
around to the coast.

70
00:06:35,343 --> 00:06:37,429
They can't hide
down there forever.

But--!

You are not to attack them.
We'll end this peacefully.

Understood, sir. But we should
prepare for all contingencies.

disobey a direct order

79
00:07:01,036 --> 00:07:02,328
and attempt to launch...

time for a full tune-up.

She may not be in
great shape right now,

On its current trajectory,

92

we'll be within its firing range
by the time we launch.

93

You really think they'll use it?

to say he'd be here by now.

So... Shima said no?

aren't for everyone, I guess.

However, I want you to think.

121
00:08:58,194 --> 00:09:00,572
We have just received
an unknown transmission

122

of uncertain origin and intent.

123
00:09:02,699 --> 00:09:04,826
Until the facts can
be fully understood,

124
00:09:04,909 --> 00:09:08,580
it is important not
to act too hastily.

125
00:09:08,663 --> 00:09:11,124
The <i>Yamato</i> is a powerful weapon.

126
00:09:11,207 --> 00:09:15,378
If she intervenes unduly in an
unknown star system's conflicts,

127
00:09:15,462 --> 00:09:17,797
that could lead to
unforeseen consequences

128
00:09:17,881 --> 00:09:19,966
that place Earth
in danger, as well.

129
00:09:20,050 --> 00:09:23,219
I do not believe that is a
future any of us wish to see.

130
00:09:23,303 --> 00:09:25,180
It's not too late.

131
00:09:25,263 --> 00:09:26,639
For the good of us all,

132
00:09:26,723 --> 00:09:30,518
leave the <i>Yamato</i> and
surrender peacefully.

133
00:09:30,602 --> 00:09:35,398
It's hard. But please...
Find the courage to do so.

to listen closely.

This is the reality we face.

00:09:52,624 --> 00:09:54,793
What the commander
says is correct,

139
00:09:54,876 --> 00:09:57,837
but the <i>Yamato</i> will
set sail on schedule.

seeking help, we must go,

Not out of duty, but
because we wish to show

143
00:10:05,637 --> 00:10:08,264
the people of Earth that
this is who we can be.

should disembark now.

00:10:44,009 --> 00:10:46,302
Navigation Division...

159
00:10:47,721 --> 00:10:50,432
Navigation Division
reporting for duty!

160
00:10:52,767 --> 00:10:54,686
Let's set sail!

161
00:10:54,769 --> 00:10:56,771
Ota. I'll take the helm for now.

162
00:10:56,855 --> 00:10:59,774
[OTA] Heh. Just be
gentle with her, okay?

163
00:11:03,445 --> 00:11:05,238
They took out
the Control Room!

164
00:11:05,321 --> 00:11:07,782
[OTA] Dockyard Control System
access has been cut off!

165
00:11:07,866 --> 00:11:10,827
They're making sure
we can't flood the dock.

166
00:11:26,384 --> 00:11:29,429
[KODAI] Close all lower hatches.
Don't let them in.

167
00:11:31,556 --> 00:11:34,100
So what's our next
move, Captain?

168
00:11:34,184 --> 00:11:35,935
[AIHARA]
Call from Engineer Yamazaki.

169
00:11:36,019 --> 00:11:37,896
Put it on the main panel.

170
00:11:37,979 --> 00:11:40,398
The dock's main system
is completely offline.

171
00:11:40,482 --> 00:11:42,734
Not only can we not flood
the dock, we have no way

172
00:11:42,817 --> 00:11:45,070
to disengage the gate
or gantry locks.

173
00:11:45,153 --> 00:11:47,572
But, if the Sub-Control
Room is still intact,

174
00:11:47,655 --> 00:11:49,657
we should be able to
activate the flood control

175
00:11:49,741 --> 00:11:51,326
and lock systems from there,

176
00:11:51,409 --> 00:11:53,745
and patch them back
in to the <i>Yamato.</i>

177
00:11:53,828 --> 00:11:55,205
But, that means--

178
00:11:55,288 --> 00:11:56,956
Someone will have to
risk going out there

179
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:00,418
to manually reboot the system
and initiate the transfer.

180
00:12:00,502 --> 00:12:01,878
That's right.

181
00:12:01,961 --> 00:12:05,048
It's not ideal, but it
may be our only option.

182
00:12:07,008 --> 00:12:10,845
Take Hoshina and Kiryu.
You three, go make it happen.

183
00:12:10,929 --> 00:12:13,139
We'll be counting on you
to get those doors open.

184
00:12:13,223 --> 00:12:14,724
Sir!

185
00:12:14,808 --> 00:12:18,061
Nanbu, bring the guns online.
Give them some covering fire.

186
00:12:18,144 --> 00:12:19,062
[NANBU]
Aye-aye.

187
00:12:19,145 --> 00:12:20,480
[KODAI]
No casualties, understood?

188
00:12:20,563 --> 00:12:22,440
[NANBU]
I know, I know.

189
00:12:23,566 --> 00:12:25,568
[SOLDIER 4B]
Their guns are live! Fall back!

190
00:12:25,652 --> 00:12:27,529
[KODAI] Be sure not to
breach the dock walls.

191
00:12:27,612 --> 00:12:29,155
[NANBU]
Output's at minimum.

192
00:12:30,407 --> 00:12:31,574
[SOLDIER 4C]
They've opened fire!

193
00:12:31,658 --> 00:12:33,118
[SOLDIER 4D]
Go! Go!

194
00:12:36,788 --> 00:12:37,789
Be careful.

195
00:12:37,872 --> 00:12:38,540
We've got this.

196
00:12:38,623 --> 00:12:39,916
Let's move.

197
00:12:46,339 --> 00:12:48,675
[SOLDIER 4E] Up top!
Three crew members on foot!

198
00:12:48,758 --> 00:12:50,802
[SOLDIER LEADER 4A]
Go! Take them into custody!

199
00:12:50,885 --> 00:12:53,972
[CREW panting]

200
00:13:00,937 --> 00:13:02,522
Just through there!

201
00:13:04,107 --> 00:13:05,358
Uh!

202
00:13:05,442 --> 00:13:07,527
[SOLDIER 4F grunting]

203
00:13:08,403 --> 00:13:10,780
[YAMAZAKI]
Hurry, go!

204
00:13:10,864 --> 00:13:12,282
[SOLDIER 4F groans]

205
00:13:14,784 --> 00:13:16,661
[SOLDIER 4G] Targets no longer
attempting to escape.

206
00:13:16,745 --> 00:13:18,747
We are currently engaged!

207
00:13:20,415 --> 00:13:21,791
[gasps] Hoshina!

208
00:13:21,875 --> 00:13:23,710
No Misaki, wait!

209
00:13:27,130 --> 00:13:28,381
It's booting up.

210
00:13:28,465 --> 00:13:31,009
Stand by to transfer
control to the <i>Yamato.</i>

211
00:13:45,357 --> 00:13:47,150
[SOLDIER LEADER 4A]
Withdraw!

212
00:13:48,151 --> 00:13:50,236
[HOSHINA] This is Hoshina
in the Sub-Control Room.

213
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,364
We've successfully opened
the flood valves.

214
00:13:52,447 --> 00:13:56,117
[KIRYU] Now transferring
system controls to the <i>Yamato.</i>

215
00:13:56,201 --> 00:13:57,452
[OTA]
Here it comes!

216
00:13:57,535 --> 00:14:00,330
Transmission of system
control program confirmed.

217
00:14:07,754 --> 00:14:09,464
[SOLDIER 4E]
They're locking us out!

218
00:14:09,547 --> 00:14:11,383
Activate sub-engine.

219
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,512
[SOLDIER LEADER 4A] <i>Yamato</i>
is preparing for departure.

220
00:14:15,595 --> 00:14:16,971
All men evacuate!

221
00:14:17,055 --> 00:14:20,225
Water level, clearing
broadside observation rooms.

222
00:14:22,936 --> 00:14:24,187
[KODAI]
Hold all hatches.

223
00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:26,773
Don't close them until
everyone's back on board.

224
00:14:36,991 --> 00:14:38,493
We have to hurry!

225
00:14:38,576 --> 00:14:41,538
If the water rises much higher,
we'll be cut off from the ship.

226
00:14:44,124 --> 00:14:48,086
Stay back! We've still got a few
of them dug in down there.

227
00:14:48,169 --> 00:14:49,713
We don't have time for this!

228
00:14:49,796 --> 00:14:51,381
Hoshina!

229
00:14:51,464 --> 00:14:53,925
[HOSHINA] The water's already
come in this far?

230
00:14:54,009 --> 00:14:55,844
[KIRYU]
We have to get off this floor.

231
00:14:55,927 --> 00:14:58,346
[SOLDIER 4H] Water's risin'
fast. Gettin' dicey in here.

232
00:14:58,430 --> 00:14:59,723
What do we do now?

233
00:14:59,806 --> 00:15:01,307
I don't know, but I hate
that the only thing keeping

234
00:15:01,391 --> 00:15:03,268
the <i>Yamato</i> from leaving is us.

235
00:15:03,351 --> 00:15:03,935
[MISAKI]
Hoshina!

236
00:15:04,019 --> 00:15:05,353

Hoshina! This way!

238
00:15:08,314 --> 00:15:10,442
[ENOMOTO] Saijo, you okay?
It's dangerous here.

239
00:15:10,525 --> 00:15:11,609
We have to get inside.

240
00:15:11,693 --> 00:15:13,653
But Yamazaki and the others!

241
00:15:13,737 --> 00:15:15,697
C'mon. We've held this
one as long as we can.

242
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:17,574
There's still the upper
hatch, they'll make it.

243
00:15:17,657 --> 00:15:20,910
Kiryu! Hoshina! Yamazaki!

244
00:15:21,369 --> 00:15:23,788
[OTA] Water level has
surpassed rear hatch limit.

245
00:15:23,872 --> 00:15:26,124
Closing bulkheads to
prevent further flooding.

246
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:27,208
[SANADA]
Send a collection team

247
00:15:27,292 --> 00:15:28,460
and have them standing
at the ready.

248
00:15:28,543 --> 00:15:31,212
[HOSHINA] Bridge, raise
the water intake rate.

249
00:15:31,296 --> 00:15:35,633
We four--Kiryu, Misaki,
Yamazaki, and Hoshina--

250
00:15:35,717 --> 00:15:37,844
will see the <i>Yamato</i>
off from here.

251
00:15:37,927 --> 00:15:41,097
But, why...? There's time!

252
00:15:41,181 --> 00:15:43,892
Even without us there, we
know the crew of the <i>Yamato</i>

253
00:15:43,975 --> 00:15:47,312
is more than capable of making
this voyage a success,

00:15:47,395 --> 00:15:49,856
and we'll be awaiting
your safe return.

played a part in helping you

You have all of our thanks.

[OTA] Water level
is clearing the bridge.

261
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:19,552
Dock flooding is complete.

262
00:16:25,975 --> 00:16:28,603
Gantry locks... release.

263
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:40,824
[KODAI] All crew, remain
at battle stations,
