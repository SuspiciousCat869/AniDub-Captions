161
00:11:07,282 --> 00:11:10,035
You must decide which one.

162
00:11:10,118 --> 00:11:11,494
If you refuse to choose

163
00:11:11,578 --> 00:11:14,080
then I will trigger revenants
on all three vessels.

164
00:11:14,164 --> 00:11:15,749
The engines will be disabled

165
00:11:15,832 --> 00:11:18,376
and they will die
along with this planet.

You can't do this!

167

Follow the feeling that you
call love... and decide.

You're not hurt, are ya?

Saito...

172
00:11:37,729 --> 00:11:40,315
Commander Hijikata
ordered me to find you.

173
00:11:40,398 --> 00:11:42,150
What the hell was that?

174
00:11:42,233 --> 00:11:43,943
Uh. Kodai!

175
00:11:48,114 --> 00:11:49,783
[SAITO]
Talk to me; what's wrong?

176
00:11:49,866 --> 00:11:53,078
One ship. I can only
save one ship.

177
00:11:53,161 --> 00:11:55,163
[SAITO]
What are you talking about?

178
00:11:55,246 --> 00:11:56,664
[KODAI]
The Gatlanteans.

179
00:11:56,748 --> 00:11:59,876
They planted some kind of human
bombs on all three ships.

180
00:11:59,959 --> 00:12:01,336
A-And I...

181
00:12:01,419 --> 00:12:03,838
Yeah? You what?

182
00:12:03,922 --> 00:12:05,757
[KODAI]
I have to choose.

183
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:09,094
I have to. That's what he said.

184
00:12:16,976 --> 00:12:20,146
[KODAI]
Kodai to <i>Yamato.</i> Do you copy?

185
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:24,401
Kodai. So he's okay.
Admiral, sir?

186
00:12:24,484 --> 00:12:26,569
Once Kodai and Saito
are onboard,

187
00:12:26,653 --> 00:12:28,530
we'll withdraw from the area.

188

189

[KODAI]
Do it, Aihara.

190
00:12:31,616 --> 00:12:33,159
On an open channel?

191
00:12:33,243 --> 00:12:36,621
Yeah, that's right. Patch me to
the colonists on the flagship.

192
00:12:36,705 --> 00:12:38,289
Tell 'em it's urgent.

193

Put him through.

Lieutenant Keyman, get us
clearance from the Gamilans.

Yes, sir.

[KODAI]
Listen to me.

197
00:12:51,678 --> 00:12:54,389
We wanted to save every single
one of you from Planet Eleven

198
00:12:54,472 --> 00:12:56,266
and get you back to Earth.

199
00:12:56,349 --> 00:12:59,853
That was our goal.
That's why we came.

200
00:12:59,936 --> 00:13:04,566
But things have... they've
taken an unexpected turn.

201
00:13:04,649 --> 00:13:08,153
I'm sorry. From the bottom
of my heart, I am.

From now on... no matter what
happens, don't lose hope.

204
00:13:15,869 --> 00:13:18,788
Lieutenant Mori will be
right there with you.

205
00:13:20,623 --> 00:13:25,295
[KODAI]
Yuki. Yuki, can you hear me?

206
00:13:25,378 --> 00:13:29,883
I'm sorry. I'm sorry
about so many things.

207
00:13:32,135 --> 00:13:36,431
I was scared. Scared of
putting you in danger.

208
00:13:36,514 --> 00:13:38,433
And losing you again.

209
00:13:38,516 --> 00:13:41,227
But, that's not all.

210
00:13:41,311 --> 00:13:45,982
When I was with you, I felt
complete. I was happy.

211
00:13:46,066 --> 00:13:49,194
I didn't care about
anything else.

212
00:13:49,277 --> 00:13:51,988
But there are bigger things
we should all care about.

213
00:13:52,072 --> 00:13:56,159
And I was losing that
part of me on Earth.

214
00:13:56,242 --> 00:13:58,953
So that's why...

215
00:13:59,037 --> 00:14:00,288
I tried to get away from you

216
00:14:00,372 --> 00:14:03,375
because I was scared
of losing us both.

217
00:14:03,458 --> 00:14:06,586
But then there you were,
on the <i>Yamato.</i>

218
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:10,006
And when I found out I tried
to hide it, but I was happy.

219
00:14:10,090 --> 00:14:13,927
It wasn't logical, but I was.
Just so completely happy.

[gasps]

221

[KODAI] I'm a hopelessly
weak and selfish person.

222
00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:21,142
I need you to
remember that, okay?

223

don't put it on yourself.

00:14:25,814 --> 00:14:28,024
I did this. Me.

I want you to live.

I couldn't bear losing you.
No matter the price,

how unbearable the sin,
I can't help it, Yuki.

I have to make this choice.

about, Kodai? What's wrong?

If we introduce energy that's
equivalent to the planet's mass,

then the conversion should
counter the gravity storm,
