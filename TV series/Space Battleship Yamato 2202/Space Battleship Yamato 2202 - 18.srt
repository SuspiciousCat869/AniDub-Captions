the knee to these invaders.

163
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:34,330
Do not forget
we crawled back up

164
00:19:34,414 --> 00:19:37,500
from the precipice of utter
ruin three years ago.

165
00:19:48,011 --> 00:19:51,514
[PRESIDENT] We humans of
Earth will never give in.

166
00:19:51,598 --> 00:19:55,560
We will fight, united,
to the very last.

167
00:19:56,644 --> 00:20:02,359
[PRESIDENT] For the ideals
of freedom and peace.

168
00:20:02,442 --> 00:20:06,237
And for the future
of our children!

169
00:20:09,157 --> 00:20:10,617
[TOKO laughs]

170
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:12,494
[gasps]

171
00:20:12,577 --> 00:20:15,789
[TOKO] The only thing that
can save a dying child

172
00:20:15,872 --> 00:20:18,875
is a parent's pure love.

173
00:20:18,958 --> 00:20:20,627
Isn't that true?

174
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:24,964
It is a love that
cannot be replaced.

175
00:20:25,048 --> 00:20:30,845
It is so pure and
yet so... selfish.

176
00:20:30,929 --> 00:20:34,307
Powerful enough to destroy
everything, too.

177
00:20:35,767 --> 00:20:38,311
Woman! What have you done?

178
00:20:44,025 --> 00:20:45,610
Tsubasa...

179
00:20:48,655 --> 00:20:50,782
[HARADA]
The day Tsubasa was born--

180
00:20:50,865 --> 00:20:52,325
for the first time,

181
00:20:52,409 --> 00:20:55,537
I think I finally understood
my purpose in life.

182
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:58,206
Suddenly everything
took on new meaning.

183
00:20:58,289 --> 00:21:03,044
This world we live in is truly
full of horrible suffering.

184
00:21:03,128 --> 00:21:07,382
But still, this innocent
child was born into it.

185
00:21:07,465 --> 00:21:10,260
It doesn't even matter
why it happened.

186
00:21:10,343 --> 00:21:14,556
He's here now, and because
of that, I'm happy.

187
00:21:14,639 --> 00:21:19,102
Happy I met you,
and that we had this child.

188
00:21:19,185 --> 00:21:20,145
[KATO cries]

189
00:21:20,228 --> 00:21:22,272
[HARADA]
We don't need anything else.

190
00:21:22,355 --> 00:21:24,899
We can be happy just as we are.

191
00:21:36,661 --> 00:21:38,538
[KATO]
I'm sorry...

192
00:21:42,584 --> 00:21:44,252
[KATO]
...Tsubasa...

193
00:21:46,338 --> 00:21:48,673
Daddy's going to hell.

194
00:21:54,012 --> 00:21:55,013
[KODAI]
What now?

195
00:21:55,096 --> 00:21:57,182
[SHIMA]
Chief Engineer, our propulsion!

196
00:22:05,732 --> 00:22:07,525
Wave Motion Engine has stopped!

197
00:22:07,609 --> 00:22:10,862
It can't be. The Anti-Wave
Motion Lattice is--?

198
00:22:10,945 --> 00:22:12,322
[KODAI gasping]

199
00:22:12,405 --> 00:22:15,158
[alarm blares]

200
00:22:20,663 --> 00:22:24,084
[OTA] We're entering the Comet
Empire's Gravity Field!

201
00:25:41,656 --> 00:25:45,326
[SAKI]
I will not allow you to pass!

202
00:25:45,410 --> 00:25:46,828
Gatlantis!
