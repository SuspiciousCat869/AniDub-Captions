In the time fault,
a next-generation AI

keeps simulating its own growth.

00:10:53,435 --> 00:10:55,145
And the data is
continually being

163
00:10:55,228 --> 00:10:57,105
updated here on the <i>Ginga</i> .

164
00:10:58,732 --> 00:11:00,984
In any case, it will
take time before the AI

165
00:11:01,067 --> 00:11:04,362
can surpass humans,
but that time is coming.

166
00:11:04,446 --> 00:11:06,865
To that end, we would
like the accumulated

167
00:11:06,948 --> 00:11:09,784
skillsets of the <i>Yamato</i>
crew to also be fed

00:11:09,868 --> 00:11:12,245
into the <i>Ginga</i> 's AI system.

169
00:11:12,328 --> 00:11:15,248
You mean you wanna copy
all of our knowledge?

170
00:11:15,331 --> 00:11:17,083
We will be splitting your
group between the first

From that point forward,
your commands will be traced.

173
00:11:22,547 --> 00:11:26,384
Of course, we have
clearance from HQ for this.

174
00:11:26,468 --> 00:11:30,889
The G Plan's success depends
on it, and HQ agrees.

The G Plan.

the survival of humans on Earth.

178
00:11:39,439 --> 00:11:43,151
So, we must transfer the DNA
of the <i>Yamato</i> to this ship.

had power like this?

Well, of course.

This ship inherited its
heart from the <i>Yamato</i> .

Even without the ability
to resuscitate a planet,

No, The Cosmo

Not just the Wave Motion Gun.

Even when we try to use
conventional armaments,

200

the system just malfunctions.
The cause is unclear.

201

That's why we can't do any

We must rely on

[SANADA] That's how it was
meant to be. I should know.

a mass-produced

it can't reach the enemy's

Right. Which is why

A capable pilot will lead

We'll delay the enemy's
advance ten days.

In that time, 100 days will

That means dozens of new

Those will be

Yuki.

316
00:22:24,417 --> 00:22:28,588
I'm so glad.
You finally woke up.

317
00:22:28,672 --> 00:22:31,007
You should probably
rest a bit longer.

318
00:22:31,091 --> 00:22:33,093
I'll go let Doctor Sado
know you're awake.

319
00:22:33,176 --> 00:22:34,177
Who's that?

320
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:36,179
[gasps]

321
00:22:36,262 --> 00:22:38,014
Who are you?

322
00:22:38,098 --> 00:22:39,683
Sorry.

323
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:51,541
Who are you?

324
00:25:51,624 --> 00:25:52,500
[NAGAKURA]
She lost all her memories

325
00:25:52,584 --> 00:25:53,752
from the last four years?

326
00:25:53,835 --> 00:25:55,628
--[KODAI] Why?
--[GAIREN] Do you truly intend

327
00:25:55,712 --> 00:25:57,797
to disrupt the
slumber of the dead?

328
00:25:57,881 --> 00:26:00,967
[YAMANAMI] I swear.
I will save the <i>Yamato</i> .

329
00:26:01,051 --> 00:26:03,178
[ZWORDER]
Let us end the suffering.
