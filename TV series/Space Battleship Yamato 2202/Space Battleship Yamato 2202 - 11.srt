This is Susumu Kodai,

00:01:53,103 --> 00:01:55,939
Acting Captain of the
Space Battleship <i>Yamato.</i>

4
00:01:56,022 --> 00:01:58,525
We don't want to keep fighting.

5
00:01:58,608 --> 00:02:02,153
We want you to peacefully
withdraw from this system.

00:02:02,237 --> 00:02:06,116
[MAZER]

00:02:17,335 --> 00:02:20,255
We have no chance of
reinforcement or resupply.

9
00:02:20,338 --> 00:02:22,382
If we keep advancing like this--

10
00:02:22,465 --> 00:02:25,176
[MAZER]
We will chase them down!

11
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:27,012
That Earthling vessel beat us.

12
00:02:27,095 --> 00:02:30,473
Yet they refused to claim
victory and put us to the sword.

13
00:02:30,557 --> 00:02:32,267
Until we sink that ship,

14
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:35,854
as warriors, we can neither
die nor truly live.

15
00:02:35,937 --> 00:02:38,565
Even if it means disobeying
the emperor's orders,

16
00:02:38,648 --> 00:02:42,652
and burning in the fires of hell
for it, we have no choice!

17
00:02:42,736 --> 00:02:44,696
All we can do is fight!

18
00:02:50,326 --> 00:02:53,997
[MIL] "You are here to
show us vindictiveness."

19
00:02:54,414 --> 00:02:56,207
Do not think
Emperor Zworder meant

20
00:02:56,291 --> 00:02:58,335
he wants that trait
for our kind.

21
00:02:58,418 --> 00:03:02,839
Such emotions of the humanoid
species are corrupting to us,

22
00:03:02,922 --> 00:03:05,008
and work like a powerful drug.

23
00:03:05,091 --> 00:03:06,926
In fact, we are
seeing its effects

24
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:10,430
on the Gatlantean mind now.
Driven by hatred for the <i>Yamato,</i>

25
00:03:10,513 --> 00:03:12,766
they are chasing
her against orders.

26
00:03:12,849 --> 00:03:16,436
And thus, they're contaminated
and threaten his perfect fleet.

27
00:03:16,519 --> 00:03:19,898
They are waste.
Which must be purged.

28
00:03:19,981 --> 00:03:24,194
[DESLER] Mil, just to be clear,
I came all this way

29
00:03:24,277 --> 00:03:26,946
because I was told I could
battle the <i>Yamato.</i>

30
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:28,531
Yes, of course.

31
00:03:28,615 --> 00:03:30,825
How you treat the source
of the contamination

32
00:03:30,909 --> 00:03:32,660
is your choice.

33
00:03:32,744 --> 00:03:36,790
I accompany you merely to report
what I see to the emperor.

34
00:03:36,873 --> 00:03:37,874
[DESLER]
Hmph.

35
00:03:37,957 --> 00:03:40,502
[GAMILOID 11A]
Ten seconds to warp out.

36
00:03:42,003 --> 00:03:45,215
Prepare to fire
the Desler Cannon.

37
00:03:55,558 --> 00:03:58,770
[MIL] We are not ruled by
the emotions of the individual,

38
00:03:58,853 --> 00:04:02,774
which is precisely why we were
able to rise up and thrive.

39
00:04:02,857 --> 00:04:06,069
To be honest, I don't like
being around you humanoids

40
00:04:06,152 --> 00:04:08,238
and your lowly pursuits.

41
00:04:14,911 --> 00:04:19,624
[GAMILOID 11A] Desler Cannon
energy charge: 120%.

42
00:04:19,708 --> 00:04:23,503
I'll be the first to admit that,
at times, we get carried away.

43
00:04:25,422 --> 00:04:30,051
[DESLER] Driven mad by our
emotions. By love, most of all.

44
00:04:36,516 --> 00:04:38,601
No, but why?!

45
00:04:57,412 --> 00:04:59,372
[GOENITZ] The contaminated
fleet has been purged

46
00:04:59,456 --> 00:05:02,167
by His Excellency, Lord Desler.

47
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:05,253
It would appear he has
passed his first test.

48
00:05:05,337 --> 00:05:08,673
Is this a good faith attempt to
repay his debt to the emperor?

49
00:05:08,757 --> 00:05:11,009
Or does he obey merely
because he understands

50
00:05:11,092 --> 00:05:13,219
he has nowhere else to go?

51
00:05:13,303 --> 00:05:16,431
[ZWORDER] Do not try to
explain him with logic.

52
00:05:16,514 --> 00:05:18,641
Keep watching,
and soon you shall see

53
00:05:18,725 --> 00:05:22,562
that which defines and
shackles them all.

54
00:05:26,733 --> 00:05:28,610
[SHIMA]
What is it? Anti-matter?

55
00:05:28,693 --> 00:05:30,904
[SANADA] No. Its characteristics
are similar,

56
00:05:30,987 --> 00:05:32,822
but this is something else.

57
00:05:32,906 --> 00:05:35,825
Some unknown form of energy.

58
00:05:35,909 --> 00:05:37,660
Interesting.
And you picked it up

59
00:05:37,744 --> 00:05:40,705
in Teresa's communication waves
from that last broadcast?

60
00:05:40,789 --> 00:05:42,874
Yes, and that's
not all we found.

61
00:05:42,957 --> 00:05:44,542
There was a vast
quantity of data

62
00:05:44,626 --> 00:05:47,420
our systems were able to decode.

63
00:05:47,504 --> 00:05:49,255
Information on Terezart.

64
00:05:49,339 --> 00:05:50,799
These schematics show complex

65
00:05:50,882 --> 00:05:53,301
gravitational interference
fields around the planet.

66
00:05:53,385 --> 00:05:58,682
And beyond that, a defensive
armada of heavily armed ships.

67
00:05:58,765 --> 00:06:00,892
And here's another model
embedded in that broadcast,

68
00:06:00,975 --> 00:06:04,354
which our computer just
finished decrypting.

69
00:06:04,437 --> 00:06:05,814
[OTA]
What is that?

70
00:06:05,897 --> 00:06:08,733
[SANADA] Terezart is completely
encased in solid rock,

71
00:06:08,817 --> 00:06:10,777
with a composition
starkly different from

72
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:13,822
the planet itself, suggesting
it was brought in later,

73
00:06:13,905 --> 00:06:16,199
from one or more
other celestial bodies.

74
00:06:16,282 --> 00:06:19,202
[NANBU] What sort of technology
could do that?

75
00:06:19,285 --> 00:06:21,830
[SANADA] Furthermore, there are
indications of enemy strongholds

76
00:06:21,913 --> 00:06:23,790
throughout this rock encasement.

77
00:06:23,873 --> 00:06:25,125
[SAITO]
You don't say.

78
00:06:25,208 --> 00:06:27,711
According to this data,
Terezart itself is hollow,

79
00:06:27,794 --> 00:06:29,546
with incredibly high
levels of energy

80
00:06:29,629 --> 00:06:32,340
in that space beneath
the planet's surface.

81
00:06:32,424 --> 00:06:35,176
That unknown energy is
flowing in from a dimension

82
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:40,932
other than our own. It's hard
to say where it's coming from.

83
00:06:41,016 --> 00:06:42,267
Teresa.

84
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:44,519
[SHIMA gasps]
But with that shell...

85
00:06:44,602 --> 00:06:45,854
[SANADA]
Even if we make it there,

86
00:06:45,937 --> 00:06:48,398
direct contact might
be impossible.

87
00:06:48,481 --> 00:06:49,524
[MORI]
No...

88
00:06:49,607 --> 00:06:51,359
Then how are we
supposed to save her?

89
00:06:51,443 --> 00:06:53,653
[HIJIKATA] The enemy's
defenses look strong.

90
00:06:53,737 --> 00:06:57,282
Even landing on Terezart could
prove incredibly difficult.

91
00:06:57,365 --> 00:07:00,076
To pull this off, we'll need to
combine the <i>Yamato</i> 's power

92
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,079
with the mobility of the Space
Cavalry and Air Corps.

93
00:07:03,163 --> 00:07:05,623
But that still may
not be enough.

94
00:07:05,707 --> 00:07:07,083
We should ask ourselves now,

95
00:07:07,167 --> 00:07:10,628
are we willing to use
the Wave Motion Gun?

96
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:15,091
XO. This unknown energy.

97
00:07:15,175 --> 00:07:17,260
Is it showing a declining trend?

98
00:07:17,344 --> 00:07:21,348
Yes, sir. If we posit that this
massive rock encasement

99
00:07:21,431 --> 00:07:24,392
is a structure designed to
extract Terezart's energy,

100
00:07:24,476 --> 00:07:26,436
then what we're seeing
all makes sense.

101
00:07:26,519 --> 00:07:28,313
The energy of Teresa?

102
00:07:28,396 --> 00:07:31,608
So Gatlantis is taking it
for themselves, like fuel?

103
00:07:31,691 --> 00:07:33,777
[HIJIKATA]
There may not be much time left.

104
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:38,031
It's your call, Acting Captain.
How do you want to fight?

105
00:08:00,512 --> 00:08:02,305
What do you want?

106
00:08:02,389 --> 00:08:06,017
Oh, when I want something,
you'll know.

107
00:08:06,101 --> 00:08:10,021
I was simply thinking about what
you did to the <i>Yamato</i> 's engine.

108
00:08:12,399 --> 00:08:16,528
So tell me, why did you
stay on this ship?

109
00:08:16,611 --> 00:08:18,780
I stayed for the warmth.

I'm about to show you
something rather interesting.

Keep your eyes on the space

There's no way! We should've
shaken 'em all by now!

Maybe they have a second line?

Just how big is
this enemy fleet?

138

It's as if the enemy
could anticipate

exactly which way we would move.

140

Hey, Kodai. Do you feel that?

00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:18,460
Yeah. Like before.

162
00:11:18,543 --> 00:11:22,505
It would seem we've been pulled
down into a dimensional rift.

[KAMO]
Chief, the wave coefficient

And the energy conversion

What? Is the pressure reduction
unit malfunctioning? Check it!

No, that's not it.

Quick, Chief. Shut down
the engine, now!

[TOKUGAWA]
What?

00:11:48,615 --> 00:11:50,825
The <i>Yamato</i> is about

High-energy atoms with
accelerated electrons

from the vacuum of space.

If it does that here, and
continues energy conversion...

00:12:20,814 --> 00:12:22,190
...it would trigger a reaction

182

that would blow the <i>Yamato</i>
apart from the inside.

We're floating inside

That's a neat little
trick you have.

206
00:13:27,255 --> 00:13:29,090
It works not only
at vast distances,

but through different
types of space as well.

That's the advantage
of the cosmo wave.

[SHIMA]
What is that tube structure?

00:14:43,748 --> 00:14:46,418
[SANADA]
It's clearly been constructed.

[AIHARA]
Some undiscovered alien race?

[SANADA] No, the style

to ruins of the Aquarians.

233
00:14:53,675 --> 00:14:55,927
And if it was built by
that advanced civilization,

234
00:14:56,011 --> 00:14:58,179
there's a decent chance
it houses technology

235
00:14:58,263 --> 00:15:01,057
that could help us.
Risky, though.

Let's go! Set a course
inside the tube structure.

We'll have to turn to a

Who among the vassals

truly understand the
heart of their emperor?

265

Even as it sullies his people,

266
00:17:00,385 --> 00:17:03,722
to him it may be like a
fragrant, intoxicating wine.

Or perhaps it's a

this all along.

Hold on. The approaching

If we raise the gravity anchor
and absorb that shockwave,

then we should be
able to reach warp

you can ride that wave?

00:19:27,907 --> 00:19:30,076
The reflection rate
won't stabilize in here!

314
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,037
Aligning with center
of emission!

315
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:34,497
[MORI] Stimulated emission
wave approaching!

316
00:19:34,581 --> 00:19:36,833
[SHIMA]
Inertial canceler to maximum!

317
00:19:38,543 --> 00:19:41,880
Contact with our stern!
It's pushing us!

318
00:19:41,963 --> 00:19:44,799
[TOKUGAWA]
Open all intake valves!

319
00:19:44,883 --> 00:19:46,926
[KODAI]
All crew, brace for warp!

320
00:19:47,010 --> 00:19:47,927
[SHIMA]
3...

321
00:19:48,011 --> 00:19:48,887
...2...

322
00:19:48,970 --> 00:19:50,889
...1...

323
00:19:50,972 --> 00:19:52,682
...warp!

324
00:20:05,904 --> 00:20:07,906
[GAMILOID 11A]
The <i>Yamato</i> has jumped.

325
00:20:07,989 --> 00:20:10,784
Just as fortuitous as always.

326
00:20:21,127 --> 00:20:23,880
[SHIMA sighs]
We made it.

327
00:20:23,963 --> 00:20:25,382
[exhales]

328
00:20:26,007 --> 00:20:27,842
[CREW sighing]

329
00:20:33,098 --> 00:20:34,265
[DESLER]
Without its core,

330
00:20:34,349 --> 00:20:37,185
this dimensional rift
should soon disappear.

331
00:20:38,728 --> 00:20:40,271
[gasps] What are you planning?

332
00:20:40,355 --> 00:20:41,523
Calm down.

333
00:20:41,606 --> 00:20:43,400
Without the interference
from that core,

334
00:20:43,483 --> 00:20:45,360
your cosmo waves
should return to normal.

335
00:20:45,443 --> 00:20:47,904
I'm surprised that
doesn't make you happy.

336
00:20:47,987 --> 00:20:49,114
[MIL growls]

337
00:20:49,197 --> 00:20:51,282
[beeping]

338
00:20:56,996 --> 00:20:58,248
Supreme Leader,

339
00:20:58,331 --> 00:21:02,085
the entire military has
been awaiting your return.

340
00:21:02,168 --> 00:21:06,131
As loyal as always.
You have my gratitude.

341
00:21:08,383 --> 00:21:10,760
Garle Desler!

342
00:21:11,344 --> 00:21:12,679
[gasping]

343
00:21:12,762 --> 00:21:16,891
Tell me, Mil. What do you
think of my actual fleet?

344
00:21:18,518 --> 00:21:21,646
Of course your emperor
will learn eventually.

345
00:21:21,730 --> 00:21:24,691
[MIL whimpering]

346
00:21:24,774 --> 00:21:28,445
But still,
there's no need to rush.

347
00:21:29,904 --> 00:21:32,574
[MORI] You could take command.
You basically did today.

348
00:21:32,657 --> 00:21:35,035
Today I helped us fall
in an enemy trap.

349
00:21:35,118 --> 00:21:37,454
I was simply cleaning up
my own mess.

350
00:21:37,537 --> 00:21:40,373
[MORI]
But, Kodai... I know.

351
00:21:40,457 --> 00:21:42,167
You'll say the same
thing he did.

352
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:44,127
"We'll carry it together," huh?

353
00:21:44,210 --> 00:21:47,213
Yes, "We'll carry it together."

354
00:21:47,297 --> 00:21:50,300
He's mature, when he's
concerned about someone else.

355
00:21:50,383 --> 00:21:51,843
[MORI]
Huh?

356
00:21:51,926 --> 00:21:53,553
[HIJIKATA] I understand
why you're worried.

357
00:21:53,636 --> 00:21:56,556
Kodai is facing a steep wall.
It's daunting.

358
00:21:56,639 --> 00:21:58,725
But he has to learn
to climb it himself.

359
00:21:58,808 --> 00:22:03,104
The best thing you can do is be
ready to catch him if he falls.

360
00:22:07,067 --> 00:22:09,444
Your parents believed in
and supported each other,

361
00:22:09,527 --> 00:22:11,446
all the way to the end.

362
00:22:12,572 --> 00:22:14,616
I know you two can do the same.

363
00:22:14,699 --> 00:22:19,996
That's what humans always do,
when we're at our best.

364
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,539
Yes, sir.

365
00:22:24,292 --> 00:22:26,169
[TOKUGAWA]
I've analyzed the data.

366
00:22:26,252 --> 00:22:28,129
When we used that
shockwave to warp,

367
00:22:28,213 --> 00:22:31,049
we achieved three times
the usual output.

368
00:22:31,132 --> 00:22:33,218
Have you been able to figure
out what caused the collapse

369
00:22:33,301 --> 00:22:35,387
of that dimensional rift?

370
00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:38,181
[SANADA] There's a signature
in the neutron fluctuations,

371
00:22:38,264 --> 00:22:43,353
something we've seen before.
Most likely...

372
00:22:43,436 --> 00:22:45,730
The Desler Cannon.

373
00:25:13,378 --> 00:25:15,380
[ZWORDER]
I've grown tired of seeing it.

374
00:25:15,463 --> 00:25:16,715
[OTA]
The White Comet has vanished!

375
00:25:16,798 --> 00:25:18,550
[TOKO] Do you love him?
Is that what drives you?

376
00:25:18,633 --> 00:25:19,718
[KEYMAN]
Kodai, she made her move!

377
00:25:19,801 --> 00:25:21,136
[KODAI]
Is that it? So it's true.

378
00:25:21,219 --> 00:25:23,013
[NANBU]
It's the home base of Gatlantis!

379
00:25:23,096 --> 00:25:24,389
[TOKO]
You're willing to kill me?

380
00:25:24,472 --> 00:25:26,474
[HIJIKATA]
Full speed! Prepare to warp!
