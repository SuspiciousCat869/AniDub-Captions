00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:56,272
[SERIZAWA]
For the past several days,

2
00:01:56,356 --> 00:01:59,651
Gatlantis has been making
moves that warrant attention.

3
00:01:59,734 --> 00:02:03,196
Pluto, Neptune,
and the asteroid belt.

4
00:02:03,279 --> 00:02:04,906
They have been
appearing repeatedly

5
00:02:04,989 --> 00:02:06,825
across our entire solar system.

6
00:02:06,908 --> 00:02:09,911
Engaging in hostilities with
our forces, then retreating.

7
00:02:09,994 --> 00:02:13,331
But this, I've no doubt
it's just a diversion.

8
00:02:13,415 --> 00:02:15,792
The only possibility is
that they're preparing for

9
00:02:15,875 --> 00:02:19,671
a large-scale invasion of Earth.
Allow me to present my evidence.

10
00:02:19,754 --> 00:02:21,756
But how can an object
the size of Jupiter

11
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,133
simply warp in like that?

12
00:02:23,216 --> 00:02:24,300
And when exactly did it arrive?

13
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:27,178
Is there any way to
negotiate with them?

14
00:02:27,262 --> 00:02:29,723
Their sole objective
is destruction.

15
00:02:29,806 --> 00:02:32,726
The statements made by refugees
from the eleventh planet,

16
00:02:32,809 --> 00:02:34,185
currently being held
on the moon,

17
00:02:34,269 --> 00:02:35,937
make that abundantly clear.

18
00:02:36,021 --> 00:02:37,647
For Gatlantis, the concept

19
00:02:37,731 --> 00:02:40,525
of conquering other cultures
and then integrating with them

20
00:02:40,608 --> 00:02:44,863
to expand their own
power does not exist.

21
00:02:44,946 --> 00:02:47,741
Well, then, in that case...

22
00:02:47,824 --> 00:02:50,368
We cannot avoid combat.

23
00:02:51,077 --> 00:02:54,330
[SERIZAWA] We are using the time
fault factory at full capacity.

24
00:02:54,414 --> 00:02:57,834
But, even so, we still don't
have sufficient numbers.

25
00:02:57,917 --> 00:02:59,544
To support further increases,

26
00:02:59,627 --> 00:03:01,713
it will be necessary
to implement a system

27
00:03:01,796 --> 00:03:04,507
that unites the government
and the people.

28
00:03:04,591 --> 00:03:06,634
The Wave Motion Fleet
was the subject

29
00:03:06,718 --> 00:03:10,347
of intense criticism. Both
internally and externally.

30
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:14,267
And now, we will
put it to the test.

31
00:03:14,351 --> 00:03:15,727
In the war with Gamilas,

32
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:17,520
humanity was pushed
to the brink.

33
00:03:17,604 --> 00:03:21,107
We stood on the very
precipice of extinction.

34
00:03:21,191 --> 00:03:23,735
And this time...

35
00:03:23,818 --> 00:03:25,820
...it's even more urgent.

36
00:03:25,904 --> 00:03:32,452
We must act as soon as possible.
If not, it will be too late.

37
00:03:32,535 --> 00:03:35,288
CR amplifying system,
confirming power!

38
00:03:35,372 --> 00:03:37,082
Roger. I'll refit that,

39
00:03:37,165 --> 00:03:40,335
along with the Wave Motion
Reactor Core's amplifier.

40
00:03:40,418 --> 00:03:44,798
[NIIMI] This is the foundation
of humanity's hope for survival.

41
00:03:44,881 --> 00:03:47,550
We must complete it,
at all costs.

42
00:03:47,634 --> 00:03:50,970
And we have to do that
before they arrive.

43
00:03:54,349 --> 00:03:55,725
[SHIMA]
Warp complete.

44
00:03:57,477 --> 00:03:58,645
[AIHARA]
We got it!

45
00:03:58,728 --> 00:04:00,605
The data transmission
from Earth just came in!

46
00:04:00,689 --> 00:04:03,942
Send it off for analysis
at once, and I presume,

47
00:04:04,025 --> 00:04:05,235
that Headquarters is monitoring

48
00:04:05,318 --> 00:04:07,070
the White Comet's
movements, as well.

49
00:04:07,153 --> 00:04:09,698
[AIHARA] Yessir!
You know, at this rate,

50
00:04:09,781 --> 00:04:13,493
we'll be able to talk to them in
real time in about three days.

51
00:04:13,576 --> 00:04:15,120
Deliver all private messages

52
00:04:15,203 --> 00:04:17,330
from friends and family
to the crew now.

53
00:04:17,414 --> 00:04:18,415
Yes, sir.

54
00:04:18,498 --> 00:04:19,582
[AIHARA]
Oh. I can't wait to hear them.

55
00:04:19,666 --> 00:04:22,502
[sighs]

56
00:04:22,585 --> 00:04:26,047
There. It's stabilized.

57
00:04:26,131 --> 00:04:27,340
Captain.

58
00:04:27,424 --> 00:04:29,467
I'd like to go take a look
at the main engine.

59
00:04:29,551 --> 00:04:31,052
[HIJIKATA]
Please do.

60
00:04:33,847 --> 00:04:36,016
Jeez, we're really pushing it.

61
00:04:36,099 --> 00:04:38,601
The daily warp limit is three,
and we've warped five.

62
00:04:38,685 --> 00:04:40,103
Not good.

63
00:04:40,186 --> 00:04:41,688
[OTA]
It's even worse than that.

64
00:04:41,771 --> 00:04:43,565
The Wave Motion Engine's
been infected

65
00:04:43,648 --> 00:04:47,819
with an Anti-Wave Motion
Lattice, too.

66
00:04:47,902 --> 00:04:51,698
[SANADA] Lieutenant Keyman
did cooperate, but still.

67
00:04:51,781 --> 00:04:55,410
Removing it is going to
prove incredibly difficult.

68
00:04:55,827 --> 00:04:57,412
Where is he?

69
00:04:57,495 --> 00:04:59,164
He's back in solitary.

70
00:04:59,247 --> 00:05:03,460
Once the work was done,
he went back on his own.

Sounds like you're in pain.

74
00:05:13,803 --> 00:05:17,307
Repeated warps are much
harder on the wounded.

75
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:19,768
You could just go to
the medical room.

76
00:05:19,851 --> 00:05:22,312
But, instead,
you choose to stay.

77
00:05:22,395 --> 00:05:24,105
It's idiotic.

78
00:05:26,149 --> 00:05:27,192
All the same.

79
00:05:27,275 --> 00:05:30,070
I am nothing but a traitor.

80
00:05:30,153 --> 00:05:33,323
If I'm not mistaken, Desler is
the one you betrayed, correct?

[gasps]

82
00:05:34,657 --> 00:05:37,285
[TOKO] Why didn't you
just go along with him?

83
00:05:37,369 --> 00:05:40,413
I know exactly
what Desler is like.

84
00:05:40,497 --> 00:05:42,165
That man has a cold strength,

85
00:05:42,248 --> 00:05:46,127
and an inability to recognize
people as living beings.

86
00:05:46,211 --> 00:05:49,130
Just like you.

87
00:05:49,214 --> 00:05:51,383
That strength gave him
the resolve to kill others,

88
00:05:51,466 --> 00:05:55,637
or even himself, if he
thought it was necessary.

89
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:59,140
And that's... what I
admire about you--

90

My mother.

91
00:06:00,767 --> 00:06:02,686
I heard her voice on that day.

When I was rescued,

I hadn't dreamt
about her for years.

95

But, then...

96
00:06:10,819 --> 00:06:13,571
The one who saved me
wasn't my mother, of course.

97
00:06:13,655 --> 00:06:17,325
It was someone else.
Akira Yamamoto.

98
00:06:17,409 --> 00:06:19,786
Were you disappointed?

No.

For some reason, I was happy.

102
00:06:25,417 --> 00:06:29,921
And I thought, "Is this a bond?
Like those Teresa mentioned?"

103
00:06:30,005 --> 00:06:31,673
[TOKO]
A bond?

104
00:06:31,756 --> 00:06:35,719
That's what she calls the ties
between people, apparently.

105
00:06:35,802 --> 00:06:37,762
Connection. Love.

There are countless
other names for it.

But for the first time,
I think I understand.

I've found it on this ship.

Well, that's very human of you.

To speak so selfishly
and irresponsibly,

111
00:06:54,696 --> 00:06:56,865

Yes. In addition to the extra

It appears the pathway

197

The Transit Wave Motion Gun?

[SANADA] Using the Anti-Wave
Motion Lattice as a Booster,

just burn it off?

Okay, but what will that do?

It can only be used one time.

lead to a rapid increase

in the amount of energy
that's emitted.

at our disposal, too.

We'll tie the Lattice
to the Gun.

The wound caused by
Lieutenant Keyman's betrayal

00:13:46,524 --> 00:13:47,901
[KODAI]
I agree.

234
00:13:47,984 --> 00:13:50,070
But, at the same time, the
Transit Wave Motion Gun may

235
00:13:50,153 --> 00:13:53,990
be our one ace in the hole for
defeating the White Comet.

236
00:13:54,074 --> 00:13:57,452
Sanada, earlier you started to
explain Zworder's thinking.

237
00:13:57,535 --> 00:13:59,829
In terms of why,
as the Emperor of Gatlantis,

238
00:13:59,913 --> 00:14:01,873
he might want to get
his hands on Teresa.

239
00:14:01,956 --> 00:14:06,711
Well. Keep in mind it's a
hypothesis. For starters,

240
00:14:06,795 --> 00:14:09,798
Teresa's a being who resides
in a higher dimension.

241

She can see all of time,
from beginning to end.

242
00:14:12,884 --> 00:14:16,971
Therefore, if she were to
fully appear in our universe,

243
00:14:17,055 --> 00:14:18,098
it'd be dangerous.

244
00:14:18,181 --> 00:14:20,475
Our universe could
lose its mutability.

245
00:14:20,558 --> 00:14:22,268
Which means it would petrify.

00:19:54,851 --> 00:19:57,020
Eight Escorts, only six Kongos.

315
00:19:57,103 --> 00:19:58,438
[growls]

316
00:19:58,521 --> 00:19:59,731
[DREADNOUGHT CREW 17A]
Multiple Karakrum-class ships

317
00:19:59,814 --> 00:20:00,899
approaching from above!

318
00:20:00,982 --> 00:20:02,233
What?

319
00:20:13,370 --> 00:20:15,497
All The Karakrums
have been destroyed!

320
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:18,833
[COMMANDER 17A]
Uh? Is it Yamanami?

321
00:20:27,258 --> 00:20:30,178
Do they actually believe they
can win with such meager troops?

322
00:20:30,261 --> 00:20:31,721
Continue pressing forward!

323
00:20:31,805 --> 00:20:35,266
Only a fool puts excessive
confidence in numbers alone.

324
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:36,851
Wise men recognize that power

325
00:20:36,935 --> 00:20:39,354
will almost always
defeat quantity.

326
00:20:47,362 --> 00:20:48,988
[VALSEY'S XO]
What? Sir Valsey.

327
00:20:49,072 --> 00:20:50,281
New enemies have
suddenly appeared

328
00:20:50,365 --> 00:20:52,742
from the directions of Dagua,
Bomi, and Zemun!

329
00:20:52,826 --> 00:20:54,494
They now have twice
their previous numbers!

330
00:20:54,577 --> 00:21:00,542
[gasps] How could Earth have
acquired a fleet of this size?

331
00:21:00,625 --> 00:21:02,085
Valsey.

332
00:21:02,168 --> 00:21:05,338
I won't tolerate stagnation
of the front line.

333
00:21:05,422 --> 00:21:07,924
I trust you understand
what I mean.

334
00:21:08,008 --> 00:21:09,217
Yes, sir!

335
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:15,390
[ZWORDER]
Interesting.

336
00:21:15,473 --> 00:21:18,184
Looks like I might enjoy this.

337
00:21:18,268 --> 00:21:19,519
[gasps]

338
00:21:21,521 --> 00:21:23,314
Emperor...

339
00:21:26,151 --> 00:21:28,445
[KATO] Two more warps and
we'll be on the battlefield.

340
00:21:28,528 --> 00:21:30,697
Get everything ready to go, now!

341
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:31,823
[PILOTS]
Roger!

342
00:21:31,906 --> 00:21:32,991
[KATO exhales]

343
00:21:33,074 --> 00:21:34,409
[beeping]

344
00:21:41,666 --> 00:21:45,253
[KATO] "There is a
way to save your son.

345
00:21:45,337 --> 00:21:50,467
Contact Toko Katsuragi
for details."

346
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:18,370
Assume the Inferno
Cannon formation!

347
00:22:52,362 --> 00:22:55,198
Hello, and welcome.

348
00:22:55,281 --> 00:22:56,991
To hell.

349
00:25:36,234 --> 00:25:37,944
[ZWORDER]
Now we shall crush them.

350
00:25:38,028 --> 00:25:39,571
[YAMANAMI]
Destroy the Gatlantean base

351
00:25:39,654 --> 00:25:40,447
inside the Comet!

352
00:25:40,530 --> 00:25:41,698
[NANBU]
What is that thing?

353
00:25:41,781 --> 00:25:43,033
[OTA] How are we even
supposed to fight it?

354
00:25:43,116 --> 00:25:44,367
[KEYMAN]
What have you done?

355
00:25:44,451 --> 00:25:46,369
[TOKO] The only thing that
can save a dying child

356
00:25:46,453 --> 00:25:47,996
is a parent's pure love.

357
00:25:48,079 --> 00:25:49,289
[KATO]
Tsubasa.

358
00:25:49,372 --> 00:25:50,874
I'm sorry.
