1
00:02:09,911 --> 00:02:11,705
Yay, Falcon!

2
00:02:11,788 --> 00:02:13,623
Here, this is Daddy's!

3
00:02:13,707 --> 00:02:15,583
Thank you, Tsubasa,

4
00:02:15,667 --> 00:02:18,003
but are you sure you want
to give it to Mommy?

5
00:02:18,086 --> 00:02:19,754
No! I changed my mind!

6
00:02:19,838 --> 00:02:22,590
[HARADA laughs]

7
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:44,154
[HARADA] That's crazy.
The <i>Yamato</i> rebelled?

8
00:02:44,237 --> 00:02:46,948
[KATO] Yeah, and I've been
served a subpoena from

9
00:02:47,032 --> 00:02:48,575
the Bureau of Defense.

10
00:02:48,658 --> 00:02:53,371
[gasps] So did you know?

11
00:02:53,455 --> 00:02:54,539
[KATO]
No.

12
00:02:55,957 --> 00:02:59,044
They think they're
being considerate...

13
00:02:59,127 --> 00:03:01,880
...leaving me on the outside.

14
00:03:01,963 --> 00:03:04,341
[KATO growls, yells]

15
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:14,809
[KATO] Just me.
I should be there with them.

16
00:03:25,403 --> 00:03:27,530
[YAMANAMI]
This is the flagship <i>Andromeda.</i>

17
00:03:27,614 --> 00:03:30,367
Aldebaran,
Apollo Norm, Achilles,

18
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:32,994
Antares, and Class D ships,

19
00:03:33,078 --> 00:03:35,330
commence deployment
on both wings.

20
00:03:35,413 --> 00:03:37,499
Launch all fighters!

21
00:03:52,764 --> 00:03:55,392
[YAMANAMI] All ships
to multi-line formation.

22
00:04:03,775 --> 00:04:05,735
[YAMANAMI]
Ten seconds until go.

23
00:04:05,819 --> 00:04:08,321
Eliminate all targets in area.

24
00:04:12,659 --> 00:04:15,203
[YAMANAMI]
All ships, open fire!

25
00:04:25,755 --> 00:04:28,967
[SHINOHARA] I don't know why
I didn't question it before.

26
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:30,719
How strange it all was--

27
00:04:30,802 --> 00:04:35,515
building an entire fleet of
battleships in just three years.

28
00:04:35,598 --> 00:04:39,686
[YAMAMOTO] The time fault...
You think it really exists?

29
00:04:39,769 --> 00:04:42,355
[SHINOHARA]
I doubt they were joking.

30
00:04:42,439 --> 00:04:46,276
They took off knowing they
were committing treason.

31
00:04:46,359 --> 00:04:50,739
[YAMAMOTO] You're right, and
now there's no turning back.

32
00:04:53,575 --> 00:04:56,745
Yeah. Guess we should
move out, too.

33
00:05:02,459 --> 00:05:04,210
[SERIZAWA] We've received
reports of deserters

34
00:05:04,294 --> 00:05:07,589
from the fleet running
drills around Jupiter.

35
00:05:07,672 --> 00:05:08,840
Mm...

36
00:05:08,923 --> 00:05:11,634
Lose one card and the
house falls to pieces.

37
00:05:11,718 --> 00:05:14,429
We must act now.

38
00:05:14,512 --> 00:05:20,226
We'll secure the <i>Yamato.</i>
Whether by surrender or by fire.

39
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:22,228
[YAMANAMI]
Pursuit team, launch.

40
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,817
[YAMANAMI] XO, how many
former <i>Yamato</i> pilots

41
00:05:27,901 --> 00:05:30,236
are part of these exercises?

42
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,489
Only the eight that
already deserted, sir.

43
00:05:32,572 --> 00:05:34,657
But there are approximately
30 of their students

44
00:05:34,741 --> 00:05:36,534
flying in the drills as well.

45
00:05:36,618 --> 00:05:38,119
[YAMANAMI]
We can't risk mutiny.

46
00:05:38,203 --> 00:05:40,747
Order all of their students to
this ship, and detain them.

47
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:43,416
[XO 5A]
Hm?! Sir!

48
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,585
The little rats are
joining the big one.

49
00:05:45,669 --> 00:05:48,338
And we've been called
to hunt them down.

50
00:05:55,762 --> 00:05:58,807
Approaching inner rim
of the asteroid belt now.

51
00:05:58,890 --> 00:06:00,308
I know it's for camouflage,

52
00:06:00,392 --> 00:06:03,186
but isn't this risky
without the Shields up?

53
00:06:03,269 --> 00:06:04,771
Since we're not ready
to warp yet,

54
00:06:04,854 --> 00:06:06,981
it's the best chance we've got.

55
00:06:07,065 --> 00:06:09,317
Sorry it's come to this,
but we're going to need

56
00:06:09,401 --> 00:06:12,987
at least another five hours to
exchange the Wave Motion Coils.

57
00:06:13,071 --> 00:06:16,241
Until we leave our system we're
in the Defense Force's backyard.

58
00:06:16,324 --> 00:06:18,827
So stay sharp,
and watch that radar.

59
00:06:18,910 --> 00:06:20,120
Sir.

60
00:06:22,414 --> 00:06:23,873
Hey, Analyzer.

61
00:06:23,957 --> 00:06:25,125
[ANALYZER]
Yes, sir.

62
00:06:25,208 --> 00:06:27,127
[SANADA] Can you access
Niimi's personal file?

63
00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:28,503
[ANALYZER]
Of course!

64
00:06:28,586 --> 00:06:33,216
Perfect. Try running a word
search for "Izumo Plan."

65
00:06:49,816 --> 00:06:53,528
[HARADA]
It's okay. You should go.

66
00:06:53,611 --> 00:06:55,613
You had a vision, right, Sabu?

67
00:06:55,697 --> 00:07:00,410
Telling you to be on that ship?
That settles it.

68
00:07:00,493 --> 00:07:02,704
Then that's where
you're meant to be.

69
00:07:04,164 --> 00:07:06,041
Makoto.

70
00:07:06,124 --> 00:07:09,419
[HARADA] Tell me,
why do you think she left?

71
00:07:09,502 --> 00:07:11,338
The <i>Yamato.</i>

72
00:07:14,382 --> 00:07:18,970
They came out of nowhere!
Takuma! Your six o'clock! Evade!

73
00:07:19,054 --> 00:07:20,805
[TAKUMA]
Copy that!

74
00:07:20,889 --> 00:07:24,184
Damn it. So much
for a unified Earth.

75
00:07:25,185 --> 00:07:26,811
[HARADA]
I've been thinking about it,

76
00:07:26,895 --> 00:07:31,691
and I feel like I
know the reason.

77
00:07:31,775 --> 00:07:34,694
It's our turn now. That's why.

78
00:07:34,778 --> 00:07:36,363
[KATO]
For what?

79
00:07:36,446 --> 00:07:39,240
When Iscandar offered help,
the whole world was overjoyed,

80
00:07:39,324 --> 00:07:43,787
weren't we? They rescued us.

81
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:47,707
They heard a voice, crying
out, and they answered.

82
00:07:47,791 --> 00:07:50,627
And this time it has to be us.

83
00:07:52,295 --> 00:07:56,424
That's why the <i>Yamato</i> launched.

84
00:07:56,508 --> 00:07:59,386
Because it's our turn to answer.

85
00:08:01,262 --> 00:08:03,139
[HARADA] During that war
and that journey

86
00:08:03,223 --> 00:08:05,308
we all did whatever we could.

87
00:08:05,392 --> 00:08:07,060
None of us knew how
things would turn out

88
00:08:07,143 --> 00:08:11,356
or if we'd make it back.
And we didn't need to know.

89
00:08:14,818 --> 00:08:16,361
Now we'll do our best again.

90
00:08:16,444 --> 00:08:20,031
That's enough.
That's what matters.

91
00:08:20,115 --> 00:08:24,703
That's all we need to
be able to tell Tsubasa.

92
00:08:24,786 --> 00:08:27,539
Go be the dad he'll be proud of.

93
00:08:30,834 --> 00:08:33,211
Go help for Tsubasa.

94
00:08:38,091 --> 00:08:41,511
For him and for me.

95
00:08:42,762 --> 00:08:44,806
Makoto.

96
00:08:44,889 --> 00:08:48,268
[HARADA]
Go! Board the <i>Yamato.</i>

97
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:17,005
[SHINOHARA]
What was that?

98
00:09:17,088 --> 00:09:20,133
--[alarm blares]
--[SHINOHARA gasps]

99
00:09:20,216 --> 00:09:22,344
[SHINOHARA]
An EMP attack?

100
00:09:22,427 --> 00:09:24,637
Our ships can't tell
friend from foe now.

101
00:09:24,721 --> 00:09:26,348
Who would want that?

102
00:09:26,431 --> 00:09:27,891
[KEYMAN]
Only machine guns will work.

103
00:09:27,974 --> 00:09:29,934
[gasps] Who's this?!

104
00:09:30,018 --> 00:09:33,104
[KEYMAN] This makes it
all about the pilots.

105
00:09:33,188 --> 00:09:36,358
Of course. If they can't use
their missiles or radar,

106
00:09:36,441 --> 00:09:38,651
then I can crush
them with skill.

107
00:09:46,826 --> 00:09:48,495
[KEYMAN]
That's the spirit.

108
00:09:48,578 --> 00:09:51,081
[YAMAMOTO]
Uh?

109
00:09:51,164 --> 00:09:52,791
A Gamilan?

110
00:09:54,376 --> 00:09:56,878
[BURREL] I realize I've
told you this before,

111
00:09:56,961 --> 00:10:00,674
but Gamilas owes a great
debt to the <i>Yamato.</i>

112
00:10:00,757 --> 00:10:03,385
And now it has left
Earth once again,

113
00:10:03,468 --> 00:10:06,388
on a journey across the stars.

114
00:10:07,013 --> 00:10:10,058
But this time,
the roles are reversed.

115
00:10:10,141 --> 00:10:11,601
Ambassador Burrel.

116
00:10:11,685 --> 00:10:14,854
Earth will take care of this
matter as we see fit.

117
00:10:14,938 --> 00:10:16,564
[BURREL]
I know.

118
00:10:16,648 --> 00:10:20,151
Which is why we feel
compelled to honor our debt.

119
00:10:26,116 --> 00:10:28,243
[YAMANAMI]
We're dealing with a rebellion.

120
00:10:28,326 --> 00:10:31,454
Seems the trip to Iscandar
has affected your crew.

121
00:10:31,538 --> 00:10:34,582
It's made them forget
the real order of things.

122
00:10:41,715 --> 00:10:43,049
[YAMANAMI]
Attention, all crew!

123
00:10:43,133 --> 00:10:45,135
This ship will now
embark on a mission!

124
00:10:45,218 --> 00:10:49,973
Our target of pursuit.
The rebel vessel... <i>Yamato</i> !

125
00:11:23,256 --> 00:11:24,966
[TOKUGAWA] It's a good thing
they never got around

126
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:27,677
to remodeling this
section of the ship.

127
00:11:27,761 --> 00:11:29,304
[SANADA]
Indeed.

128
00:11:29,387 --> 00:11:32,223
But still. We inherited
all of this equipment

129
00:11:32,307 --> 00:11:35,769
from the old Izumo Plan.
How will it help us now?

130
00:11:37,354 --> 00:11:39,939
[SAIJO] Fighters approaching
from above, starboard side!

131
00:11:40,023 --> 00:11:41,149
They're here.

132
00:11:41,232 --> 00:11:42,734
[SAIJO] We've identified
some of the models.

133
00:11:42,817 --> 00:11:46,279
Space Fighter Attack Plane,
Cosmo Tiger Two.

134
00:11:49,074 --> 00:11:51,451
Hold all fire until
I've given the command.

135
00:11:51,534 --> 00:11:53,036
We won't be the first to shoot.

136
00:11:53,119 --> 00:11:55,413
[SAIJO]
Fifteen seconds to contact.

137
00:12:00,752 --> 00:12:01,836
[gasps]

138
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:13,890
[CREW gasping]

139
00:12:13,973 --> 00:12:15,767
[SAIJO]
ID codes are a match.

140
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:20,563
It's... The Lunar Surface
Air Corps! Yamamoto's team!

141
00:12:20,647 --> 00:12:23,942
The Cosmo Tigers.
Open the hatch, bring 'em in.

142
00:12:24,025 --> 00:12:26,194
[CREW laughing, cheering]

143
00:12:30,448 --> 00:12:34,244
[FIGHTER SQUAD
laughing, cheering]

144
00:12:34,327 --> 00:12:35,328
Hey.

145
00:12:35,412 --> 00:12:36,746
[KODAI]
It's been a while, hasn't it?

146
00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:39,666
D'you know anything
about that Gamilan fighter?

147
00:12:39,749 --> 00:12:42,252
[KODAI]
Yeah, it's from the embassy.

148
00:12:55,932 --> 00:12:59,227
[KODAI] Lieutenant Keyman.
Wanna tell me why you're here?

149
00:12:59,310 --> 00:13:02,480
I've already told you.
When I requested to board,

150
00:13:02,564 --> 00:13:05,275
I wish to be an advisor
on this ship.

151
00:13:05,358 --> 00:13:07,652
This voyage will be
full of unknowns.

152
00:13:07,736 --> 00:13:10,530
Our Gamilan knowledge
of Terezart can help.

153
00:13:10,613 --> 00:13:12,782
Why don't you just tell
us what you know?

154
00:13:12,866 --> 00:13:16,411
Let me stay;
you can trust me.

155
00:13:19,998 --> 00:13:23,251
[SHIMA] Heh. You might as well,
Acting Captain.

156
00:13:23,335 --> 00:13:25,003
I mean, we are a little
shorthanded.

157
00:13:25,086 --> 00:13:26,463
Do you mind?

158
00:13:26,546 --> 00:13:30,383
Ship at 12 o'clock! Closing
rapidly at 32 space-knots!

159
00:13:30,467 --> 00:13:32,010
Distance: point-seven
light seconds.

160
00:13:32,093 --> 00:13:36,389
Contact in 130 seconds.
Hey! That's the <i>Andromeda</i> !

161
00:13:36,473 --> 00:13:37,515
How are the Shields?

162
00:13:37,599 --> 00:13:40,393
I'm swapping in
the last coil now.

163
00:13:40,477 --> 00:13:41,853
[AIHARA]
The <i>Andromeda</i> 's hailing us.

164
00:13:41,936 --> 00:13:44,147
Put it up on the main screen.

165
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:48,485
Have you stopped to think
about what you're doing?

166
00:13:48,568 --> 00:13:50,862
Obeying ghosts of the dead?

167
00:13:50,945 --> 00:13:53,531
Listen to me, Acting Captain.

168
00:13:53,615 --> 00:13:55,492
Turn back your ship.

169
00:13:56,868 --> 00:13:59,245
We can't turn back,
we know something terrible's

170
00:13:59,329 --> 00:14:01,081
about to happen out there.

171
00:14:03,041 --> 00:14:04,751
And what will you do
when you realize

172
00:14:04,834 --> 00:14:07,003
the <i>Yamato</i> can't
handle it alone?

173
00:14:09,464 --> 00:14:11,007
[YAMANAMI]
Think clearly.

174
00:14:11,091 --> 00:14:14,177
First, you need to come
to terms with reality--

175
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:17,639
The reality is we're heading
toward the wrong future!

176
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:36,991
Last warning. Turn back.

177
00:14:39,619 --> 00:14:41,996
Your order's refused.

178
00:14:43,998 --> 00:14:45,959
That's a pity.

179
00:14:46,042 --> 00:14:48,378
Quick! Crew to battle stations!

180
00:14:48,461 --> 00:14:51,464
Shima. Set a direct course
for the asteroid belt.

181
00:14:51,548 --> 00:14:52,757
I want you to go in.

182
00:14:52,841 --> 00:14:53,758
Wait, go in?

183
00:14:53,842 --> 00:14:55,885
But the Shields
aren't online yet!

184
00:14:55,969 --> 00:14:57,804
Do it. I have an idea.

185
00:14:57,887 --> 00:15:00,974
[SAIJO] Distance from <i>Andromeda:</i>
point-three light seconds.

186
00:15:02,017 --> 00:15:03,393
[YAMANAMI]
We'll force them to stop.

187
00:15:03,476 --> 00:15:06,187
Prepare to fire graviton spread.

188
00:15:06,271 --> 00:15:08,815
Our target is the <i>Yamato.</i>

189
00:15:08,898 --> 00:15:10,734
Fire!

190
00:15:18,408 --> 00:15:20,952
[SAIJO] The asteroids in front
of us have been obliterated!

191
00:15:21,036 --> 00:15:23,955
Keep your cool.
We're out of range.

192
00:15:24,039 --> 00:15:26,332
Depth charge launchers
standing by!

193
00:15:26,416 --> 00:15:27,834
Fire!

194
00:15:44,976 --> 00:15:47,270
[TOKUGAWA]
Fire magnetron wave.

195
00:15:55,737 --> 00:15:56,988
[SURVEYOR 5A]
Target locked.

196
00:15:57,072 --> 00:15:58,448
Fire!

197
00:16:06,206 --> 00:16:08,416
[XO 5A]
Confirmed hit, all shots.

198
00:16:19,678 --> 00:16:21,805
What is that, sir?

199
00:16:23,973 --> 00:16:25,767
[YAMANAMI]
An asteroid hull.

200
00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:29,437
They dipped into the history
books for that old move.

201
00:16:34,442 --> 00:16:35,402
Almost, Chief!

202
00:16:35,485 --> 00:16:38,238
Can you just buy me
another minute?

203
00:16:38,321 --> 00:16:40,281
Release asteroids!

204
00:16:45,912 --> 00:16:48,164
EM induction to maximum!

205
00:16:48,248 --> 00:16:51,167
High-speed rotation.
Protect the hull!

206
00:16:51,501 --> 00:16:53,128
Spinning now!

207
00:17:15,692 --> 00:17:18,862
[TOKUGAWA]
Asteroid layer depleted to 50%.

208
00:17:18,945 --> 00:17:21,614
Come on! A little longer!

209
00:17:21,698 --> 00:17:24,159
[TOKUGAWA]
Asteroid layer to 30%.

210
00:17:24,868 --> 00:17:27,912
[ENOMOTO] This is Enomoto.
I'm all done down here!

211
00:17:27,996 --> 00:17:29,748
Halt EM induction!

212
00:17:29,831 --> 00:17:33,209
Deploy the Shields!
All energy to the bow!

213
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:40,216
[SAIJO] Ten seconds until
contact with the <i>Andromeda.</i>

214

--[KODAI] Brace for impact!
--All crew, brace for impact!

[YAMANAMI] Your boy's
unbelievably stubborn...

216
00:18:23,301 --> 00:18:25,679
...Admiral Okita.

217
00:18:36,272 --> 00:18:39,693
[XO 5A] Captain, permission to
reverse course and pursue.

218
00:18:41,736 --> 00:18:43,738
Uh. Captain?

219
00:18:43,822 --> 00:18:45,615
[COMMS. OFFICER 5A]
Urgent call from HQ.

220
00:18:45,699 --> 00:18:47,075
On screen.

221
00:18:50,370 --> 00:18:51,579
[TODO]
This is Headquarters.

222
00:18:51,663 --> 00:18:53,832
We are Issuing
a fleet-wide order

223
00:18:53,915 --> 00:18:55,834
for all ships in the system.

224
00:18:55,917 --> 00:18:59,045
You are to cease your
pursuit of the <i>Yamato.</i>

225
00:19:03,383 --> 00:19:05,885
[TODO] Suspicions of treason
against the <i>Yamato</i> crew

226
00:19:05,969 --> 00:19:07,137
have been lifted.

227
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:09,806
Let me repeat.
Suspicions of treason

228
00:19:09,889 --> 00:19:12,142
against the <i>Yamato</i> crew
have been lifted.

229
00:19:12,225 --> 00:19:15,228
Lifted? But why?

230
00:19:15,311 --> 00:19:20,525
I told you that we could help.
You're welcome.

231
00:19:20,608 --> 00:19:24,070
We thank you sincerely,
Mr. President, sir.

232
00:19:24,154 --> 00:19:26,364
I just hope you're happy.

233
00:19:28,908 --> 00:19:32,120
[BURREL] The time fault
doesn't only affect Earth.

234
00:19:32,203 --> 00:19:36,833
The future of Gamilas
depends on it, as well.

235
00:19:36,916 --> 00:19:39,377
If you go after those
who learn it exists--

236
00:19:39,461 --> 00:19:41,463
that sets a dangerous precedent.

237
00:19:41,546 --> 00:19:43,923
There's a nasty rumor
that the leak came

238
00:19:44,007 --> 00:19:46,426
from someone connected
to the Gamilan embassy.

239
00:19:46,509 --> 00:19:48,094
That true?

240
00:19:48,178 --> 00:19:50,764
If it is true that would
be terrible, sir.

241
00:19:50,847 --> 00:19:53,600
We'll launch a thorough inquiry.

242
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:00,774
[BURREL] In any case,
there are no consequences

243
00:20:00,857 --> 00:20:03,526
for the <i>Yamato</i> 's rebellion.
Your military command

244
00:20:03,610 --> 00:20:05,820
has now sanctioned
their voyage to Terezart

245
00:20:05,904 --> 00:20:09,240
and will give them
operational independence.

246
00:20:09,324 --> 00:20:11,576
Are you sure that's
an acceptable outcome?

247
00:20:11,659 --> 00:20:12,869
[PRESIDENT]
You got what you wanted.

248
00:20:12,952 --> 00:20:15,038
I'll worry about that.

249
00:20:17,290 --> 00:20:19,918
[TODO] Crew of the <i>Yamato,</i>
as Chief Commander,

250
00:20:20,001 --> 00:20:22,962
I will now issue
your official orders.

251
00:20:25,006 --> 00:20:28,093
You will uncover the truth
behind this apparent crisis.

252
00:20:28,176 --> 00:20:32,639
Do what you must, and then
return to Earth safely.

253
00:20:32,722 --> 00:20:33,973
That is all.

254
00:20:35,517 --> 00:20:37,018
[gasps]

255
00:21:34,951 --> 00:21:39,414
[XO 5A] As you ordered, I had
that squadron take it with them.

256
00:21:39,497 --> 00:21:43,335
All their students requested
to transfer to the <i>Yamato.</i>

257
00:21:43,418 --> 00:21:44,586
Did you want them onboard

258
00:21:44,669 --> 00:21:46,713
because you guessed
this would happen?

259
00:21:46,796 --> 00:21:50,717
[YAMANAMI] No, I wanted them
as hostages, as a last resort.

260
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:53,595
But it all worked out.

261
00:21:54,888 --> 00:21:58,850
[KATO] This is former Yamato Air
Corps Commander Saburo Kato.

262
00:21:58,933 --> 00:22:00,560
Requesting permission to dock.

263

--[AIHARA] Kato!
--[NANBU] It's Kato!

264
00:22:02,103 --> 00:22:03,855

Kato came!

265
00:22:06,441 --> 00:22:11,654
[KATO] Tsubasa, this is the

266
00:22:12,739 --> 00:22:15,408
[KATO] I want to show you
this one, too.

267
00:25:11,167 --> 00:25:13,128
[TODO] The <i>Yamato</i> could
never face them alone.

268
00:25:13,211 --> 00:25:14,379
[YAMAMOTO]
Isn't it contradictory

269
00:25:14,462 --> 00:25:16,715
to simply watch while
our own people drown?

270
00:25:16,798 --> 00:25:18,383
[KODAISHIMA]
It's too risky!

271
00:25:18,466 --> 00:25:20,510
[KEYMAN] The <i>Yamato</i> as it
is now has a major weakness.

272
00:25:20,593 --> 00:25:22,095
I think you know what I mean.

273
00:25:22,178 --> 00:25:24,931
[KODAI] Begin rescue mission!
We're going to Planet Eleven!
