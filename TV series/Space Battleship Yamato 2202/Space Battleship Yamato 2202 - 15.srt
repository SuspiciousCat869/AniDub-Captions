But we,

[MATHIUS] Uncle,
if that's indeed the case,

But Sir Mathius.

18

Finding a planet with the

difficult enough, let alone one
suitable for billions of people!

Even second-class citizens?

Do you think we should just
interbreed with them?

Is that the only way we can
survive on another planet?

This is all absurd!

[NOBLE 15C]
We've no choice.

00:11:21,671 --> 00:11:24,049
[KODAI] Desler. What did
you ask Teresa to do?

159
00:11:24,132 --> 00:11:27,135
[DESLER] I suppose, in the end,
legends are only stories.

160
00:11:27,218 --> 00:11:31,348
However, Emperor Zworder appears
to have other ideas about her.

161
00:11:31,431 --> 00:11:32,515
[gasps]

162
00:11:32,599 --> 00:11:33,975
[DESLER]
The emperor is rather hellbent

163
00:11:34,059 --> 00:11:36,978
on sealing Teresa's power away.

164
00:11:37,062 --> 00:11:40,315
And now that I've got Teresa
right here within my grasp,

165
00:11:40,398 --> 00:11:43,193
I will no longer be
their caged little bird.

166
00:11:43,276 --> 00:11:46,029
I am their negotiating partner.

167
00:11:46,112 --> 00:11:48,281
The ancient ruins of Aquarius

168
00:11:48,365 --> 00:11:50,575
gave Gatlantis a
disproportionate level

169
00:11:50,658 --> 00:11:54,537
of military might and
scientific prowess.

170
00:11:54,621 --> 00:11:57,207
Their power has made it
all the more possible

171
00:11:57,290 --> 00:11:59,501
for my wish to be granted.

172
00:11:59,584 --> 00:12:03,254
At long last.

173
00:12:03,338 --> 00:12:07,175
I did not come expecting
anything from God.

174
00:12:07,258 --> 00:12:10,387
The reason I'm here is solely
to gain the upper hand

175
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:13,014
in negotiations
with Gatlantis.

176
00:12:13,098 --> 00:12:14,265
That means you people,

177
00:12:14,349 --> 00:12:16,893
who come with the goal
of liberating Terezart,

178
00:12:16,976 --> 00:12:20,230
have now become my mortal
adversaries once again.

179
00:12:20,313 --> 00:12:23,149
[SANADA] What logical reason
could the emperor possibly have

180
00:12:23,233 --> 00:12:25,318
for wanting to seal away
Teresa's power?

181
00:12:25,402 --> 00:12:28,029
If you know, why not tell us?

182
00:12:28,113 --> 00:12:30,865
If it's anything along the
lines of what I'm imagining,

183
00:12:30,949 --> 00:12:34,285
even if Gatlantis were to agree
to negotiate with you, well,

184
00:12:34,369 --> 00:12:37,038
the result would
only be temporary.

185
00:12:37,122 --> 00:12:39,040
The emperor wants
Teresa's power to--

186
00:12:39,124 --> 00:12:40,000
[buzzing]

187
00:12:40,083 --> 00:12:41,584
[DESLER]
Hm?

188
00:12:41,668 --> 00:12:44,254
Leader! I've less-than-ideal
news to report.

189
00:12:44,337 --> 00:12:46,172
The <i>Yamato</i> has begun to travel.

190
00:12:46,256 --> 00:12:48,508
We are preparing to intercept
them as we speak.

191
00:12:48,591 --> 00:12:50,135
[DESLER]
Hmm...

192
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:14,701
[SAITO gasps]

193
00:13:17,203 --> 00:13:19,664
Nagakura! What the hell
are you doing?

194
00:13:19,748 --> 00:13:22,042
Just disobeying orders, sir!

195
00:13:25,045 --> 00:13:27,213
We're diving at maximum speed!

196
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:58,078
Watch out!
These guys are pretty tough!

197
00:14:03,708 --> 00:14:05,669
[BURRELL]
It's a lonely road you walk.

198
00:14:05,752 --> 00:14:07,712
Understand? To succeed, you must

199
00:14:07,796 --> 00:14:10,590
deceive everybody with
whom you become involved.

200
00:14:10,674 --> 00:14:12,592
We are ashamed that
you must take on

201
00:14:12,676 --> 00:14:14,511
such a dangerous
mission yourself.

202
00:14:14,594 --> 00:14:18,807
Because eventually,
you'll betray the <i>Yamato.</i>

203
00:14:23,853 --> 00:14:25,146
[AIHARA]
<i>Czvarke</i> has reached sea level!

204
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:27,065
[SAIJO] Large battleship
detected to the rear!

205
00:14:27,148 --> 00:14:28,983
Begin rapid ascent!

206
00:14:44,582 --> 00:14:46,292
Warfare against you people.

207
00:14:46,376 --> 00:14:49,379
It's a highly
unpredictable affair.

208
00:14:49,462 --> 00:14:51,840
Do you read me? Talan?

209
00:14:51,923 --> 00:14:54,092
Bring the ship back immediate--

210
00:15:00,598 --> 00:15:04,477
[KODAI] Why don't we end this
now, Supreme Leader Desler?

211
00:15:04,561 --> 00:15:08,064
Oh, it has yet to
even begin, boy.

212
00:15:08,148 --> 00:15:11,401
So, how do you plan to end it?
Do you have the faintest clue?

213
00:15:11,484 --> 00:15:13,236
I'm here on behalf
of the <i>Yamato.</i>

214
00:15:13,319 --> 00:15:16,781
Susumu Kodai.
Chief Tactical Officer.

215
00:15:16,865 --> 00:15:19,784
Take your troops and
withdraw from Terezart.

216
00:15:19,868 --> 00:15:26,416
[DESLER] Kodai? I see.
The same boy from back then.

217
00:15:26,499 --> 00:15:29,461
Don't underestimate me.
As someone who died once,

218
00:15:29,544 --> 00:15:31,296
what makes you think
I will submit now?

219
00:15:31,379 --> 00:15:32,297
Kodai!

220
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:33,965
[NAGAKURA]
He's being reckless.

221
00:15:34,049 --> 00:15:35,800
[DESLER] These silly dolls
will not shoot me,

222
00:15:35,884 --> 00:15:37,218
no matter what I do.

223
00:15:37,302 --> 00:15:42,390
However, that's only true
as long as I remain alive.

224
00:15:42,474 --> 00:15:45,727
So, just go ahead
and pull the trigger.

225
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:48,188
[KODAI grunts]

226
00:15:51,775 --> 00:15:53,943
What's the matter?
My dear Kodai.

227
00:15:54,027 --> 00:15:56,071
If you lack the courage, then--

Take 'em out, Nakagura!

231
00:16:03,661 --> 00:16:05,372
You got it!

232
00:16:24,516 --> 00:16:27,352
[NAGAKURA]
Nice work, Mr. Gamilas!

233
00:16:27,435 --> 00:16:28,853
[KEYMAN grunts]

234
00:16:34,359 --> 00:16:37,028
I have a question for
Supreme Leader Desler.

235
00:16:37,112 --> 00:16:38,405
I'd like to know,

236
00:16:38,488 --> 00:16:41,366
what exactly was it
that brought you here?

237
00:16:43,243 --> 00:16:45,787
[DESLER] Who are you?
I don't know you.

238
00:16:51,876 --> 00:16:55,547
My real name is Ranhalt Desler.

239
00:16:56,589 --> 00:16:59,926
[gasps] Wait, Desler?

240
00:17:04,389 --> 00:17:09,019
[CROWD]
Desler! Desler! Desler...

241
00:17:09,102 --> 00:17:11,813
[ABELT]
How did this come to pass?

242
00:17:11,896 --> 00:17:15,191
The person known
as Abelt Desler

243
00:17:15,275 --> 00:17:16,526
was not even worthy enough

244
00:17:16,609 --> 00:17:20,488
to anchor his own mother's
heart to this world.

245
00:17:20,572 --> 00:17:22,365
That's who I once was.

246
00:17:25,243 --> 00:17:26,828
[ABELT]
The unification of Gamilas

247
00:17:26,911 --> 00:17:31,166
accomplished by my uncle--
I've been entrusted with it,

248
00:17:31,249 --> 00:17:34,753
and a secret almost
too great to bear.

249
00:17:34,836 --> 00:17:38,798
If the people give up hope,
they'll become weak.

250
00:17:38,882 --> 00:17:43,345
If they believe they have no
future, then Gamilas will...

251
00:17:44,429 --> 00:17:47,891
[ABELT] This is the surest way
to accomplish our goal.

252
00:17:47,974 --> 00:17:51,895
Baleras Tower was built
expressly for this purpose.

253
00:17:51,978 --> 00:17:54,397
We cannot turn back now.

254
00:17:54,481 --> 00:17:59,027
In order for Gamilas to survive,
we must have Iscandar.

255
00:17:59,110 --> 00:18:02,572
[CROWD]
Desler! Desler! Desler...

My most dearly beloved citizens
of the Gamilan Empire!

257
00:18:15,001 --> 00:18:17,962
If we are ever to see lasting
peace throughout space,

258
00:18:18,046 --> 00:18:22,300
the spread of Iscandarism is not
just important but essential.

259
00:18:22,384 --> 00:18:25,637
This mission is the will of God!
A divine duty that has been

260
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:28,515
delegated to us, the great
people of Gamilas!

[CROWD cheers]

[ABELT] With all the speed we
can muster, as many planets

263
00:18:33,603 --> 00:18:37,232
as possible must be brought
under the dominion of Gamilas!

Turn your eyes beyond the
limits of the Magellan Galaxy!

[KEYMAN]
This policy of rapid expansion

brought indescribable wealth
and power to our planet.

00:18:53,581 --> 00:18:59,212
The result, resistance fomented
against you, our Supreme Leader.

270
00:18:59,295 --> 00:19:00,630
In fact,

271
00:19:00,714 --> 00:19:04,050
you were subjected to countless
assassination attempts.

00:19:05,218 --> 00:19:07,929
Some by my family, yes.

You're nothing but a tyrant now!

[DESLER] The woman was
my elder brother's widow.

277
00:19:19,274 --> 00:19:23,028
I made it appear as though I
had executed her for her crime,

278
00:19:23,111 --> 00:19:25,655
but I exiled her instead.

279
00:19:26,531 --> 00:19:28,366
[DESLER]
It was the least I could do.

280
00:19:28,450 --> 00:19:31,411
A way to honor
my brother's memory.

You've grown into a man.

[gasping]

283
00:19:43,381 --> 00:19:45,967
Does this mean you're
Desler's family?

284
00:19:47,802 --> 00:19:51,639
I am. My mother died
in abject poverty.

285
00:19:56,269 --> 00:20:00,065
Tell me, is it true that Gamilas
will soon be destroyed?

286
00:20:00,148 --> 00:20:02,025
[gasps]

287
00:20:03,777 --> 00:20:06,821
[KEYMAN] When you've been posted
to outer space, you can feel it:

288
00:20:06,905 --> 00:20:09,991
we pure-blooded Gamilans
can't live long off-world.

289
00:20:10,075 --> 00:20:13,912
We need Gamilas, or something
like it, to survive.

290
00:20:13,995 --> 00:20:16,206
For that reason,
we must find a planet

291
00:20:16,289 --> 00:20:17,957
with the same atmosphere
as our home.

292
00:20:18,041 --> 00:20:20,001
Or we must create
one artificially,

293
00:20:20,085 --> 00:20:23,088
and relocate all of our kind
there within half a century.

Every single Gamilan.

295
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:32,639
To ensure a project of such
monumental scale would succeed,

296
00:20:32,722 --> 00:20:37,143
you set out to dominate space
by any means necessary.

297
00:20:37,227 --> 00:20:41,856
Even as you gained a
reputation as a despot.

298
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:45,402
Modification of the climate
by way of planetary bombs.

299
00:20:45,485 --> 00:20:47,487
That's why the Earth was...?

Is it true, then?

301
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:55,537
You did those horrid things,
but only to save your home?

Yes, so what?

At this point, does any
of it really matter?

[DESLER] I no longer possess
the authority that I once did.

00:21:15,348 --> 00:21:17,934
I can make a wish
to a powerless god.

Or negotiate to strike
a deal with Gatlantis.

in my favor with either.

benefit from Teresa's power?

313
00:21:55,722 --> 00:21:57,307
Please tell me.

314
00:21:59,601 --> 00:22:02,854
I believe you already
know the answer to that.

315
00:22:02,937 --> 00:22:05,774
[KEYMAN]
Our home planet... Gamilas.

316
00:22:05,857 --> 00:22:09,361
That's what you've been
working for all along?

317
00:22:09,444 --> 00:22:12,072
Hey. Hold on just a minute.

318
00:22:12,155 --> 00:22:14,407
What are you saying, you Gammy?

319
00:22:14,491 --> 00:22:16,117
My nephew.

320
00:22:16,201 --> 00:22:19,788
The path from here will
be nothing but carnage.

321
00:22:23,875 --> 00:22:27,879
So if you walk with me,
you must discard your emotions.

322
00:22:27,962 --> 00:22:31,883
Because if you do not, then you
will surely go astray as I did.

323
00:22:31,966 --> 00:22:33,760
No! Don't listen to a word

324
00:22:33,843 --> 00:22:36,304
this evil bastard
says to you, Keyman!

325
00:22:36,388 --> 00:22:37,222
[SAITO grunting]

326
00:22:37,305 --> 00:22:38,139
Keyman!

327
00:22:38,223 --> 00:22:39,099
[gasps]

328
00:22:39,182 --> 00:22:40,725
[SANADA exhales]

329
00:22:47,565 --> 00:22:50,360
I'm sorry, but I must.

331

[gunshot]

332
00:25:36,943 --> 00:25:39,154
[DESLER] I never imagined I
would see you alive again.

333
00:25:39,237 --> 00:25:40,739
[SAITO]
What do you think you're doing?

334
00:25:40,822 --> 00:25:42,365
[KEYMAN] If you're going
to kill me, do it later.

335
00:25:42,449 --> 00:25:44,451
[TERESA] It appears that all
the bonds are in place at last.

336
00:25:44,534 --> 00:25:46,578
[BURRELL]
I promise. I will arrest him.

337
00:25:46,661 --> 00:25:50,373
[DESLER] At that time, what
was I trying to destroy?
