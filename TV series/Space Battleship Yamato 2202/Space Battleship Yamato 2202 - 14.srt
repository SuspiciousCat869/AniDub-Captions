1
00:01:58,525 --> 00:02:00,944
Main engine output
is increasing!

2
00:02:01,027 --> 00:02:02,946
Good. It's stabilized.

3
00:02:25,593 --> 00:02:27,929
[ZWORDER]
The <i>Yamato</i> has arrived.

4
00:02:28,013 --> 00:02:30,890
It remains a mystery.

5
00:02:30,974 --> 00:02:32,642
What could be driving them?

6
00:02:32,726 --> 00:02:35,020
Why do they go to such lengths?

7
00:03:01,212 --> 00:03:02,881
This is never ending!

8
00:03:02,964 --> 00:03:05,425
Front line, take care of
the needles on the surface!

9
00:03:05,508 --> 00:03:07,427
Rear line, target
enemies in the air!

10
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:08,887
[CAVALRY]
Roger!

11
00:03:13,475 --> 00:03:15,852
[TSURUMI panting]

12
00:03:23,485 --> 00:03:26,237
[TERESA]
We share a powerful bond.

13
00:03:27,739 --> 00:03:29,866
[TERESA]
Its strength connects us.

14
00:03:29,949 --> 00:03:33,620
Ties us to that ship
with incredible force.

15
00:03:45,632 --> 00:03:46,883
[ZURVIVAL]
Cursed phantoms.

16
00:03:46,966 --> 00:03:49,094
Still haven't learned, have you?

17
00:03:49,177 --> 00:03:50,220
[HELVESTIA]
Confirming destruction

18
00:03:50,303 --> 00:03:52,180
of the Terezart Defense Fleet.

19
00:03:52,263 --> 00:03:55,975
Vital signs of two Gorland
types have gone silent.

20
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:59,062
All divisions, assemble!

21
00:03:59,145 --> 00:04:02,107
Eliminate them, along with the
troops that landed before them!

22
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:04,609
I will fight beside you!

23
00:04:06,236 --> 00:04:07,904
[ZURVIVAL]
So, it's true,

24
00:04:07,987 --> 00:04:11,199
this world has slipped
from our control.

25
00:04:11,282 --> 00:04:12,951
Still, I won't give in.

26
00:04:13,034 --> 00:04:15,453
I'll live my life,
and savor the hope

27
00:04:15,537 --> 00:04:18,748
that I might survive when
all is said and done.

28
00:04:18,832 --> 00:04:20,417
<i>Yamato</i> !

29
00:04:26,715 --> 00:04:29,551
Second Drop Team,
all units launch!

30
00:04:30,427 --> 00:04:33,638
Space Cavalry, prepare to
employ special equipment.

31
00:04:33,722 --> 00:04:35,056
[SAITO]
Roger!

32
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:36,641
We're just breaking
down bedrock.

33
00:04:36,725 --> 00:04:38,560
Why can't we do that
from the <i>Yamato</i> ?

34
00:04:38,643 --> 00:04:40,520
The main gun's not
powerful enough.

35
00:04:40,603 --> 00:04:42,105
The Wave Motion Gun won't do,

36
00:04:42,188 --> 00:04:44,774
as that would destroy
Terezart altogether.

37
00:04:44,858 --> 00:04:46,359
Our only choice is to rely on

38
00:04:46,443 --> 00:04:49,779
the Wave Motion Excavator
Warheads the XO developed.

39
00:04:51,656 --> 00:04:54,034
Have faith in Kodai
and the others.

40
00:05:15,388 --> 00:05:17,432
[TSURUMI]
Akira. You...

41
00:05:17,515 --> 00:05:19,392
Try not to talk.

42
00:05:21,436 --> 00:05:24,814
You're going to make it.
You'll live, Akira.

43
00:05:24,898 --> 00:05:26,900
[YAMAMOTO]
Hm?

44
00:05:26,983 --> 00:05:30,820
[TSURUMI] That woman told me
you'll be okay.

45
00:05:30,904 --> 00:05:32,447
What woman?

46
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:33,865
[rumbling]

47
00:05:33,948 --> 00:05:35,658
[NAGAKURA]
Enemy at your nine o'clock!

48
00:05:35,742 --> 00:05:39,162
It's a group of Medarusa-class
customized surface tanks!

49
00:05:47,253 --> 00:05:48,755
[NAGAKURA]
Ensign Yamamoto.

50
00:05:48,838 --> 00:05:50,715
We'll hold them off
as long as we can.

51
00:05:50,799 --> 00:05:53,551
Take the wounded with you.
Do your best to keep them safe.

52
00:05:53,635 --> 00:05:55,053
Roger that.

53
00:05:55,762 --> 00:05:58,014
[NAGAKURA] Fan out.
Try to hit every one of 'em!

54
00:05:58,098 --> 00:05:59,182
[CAVALRY]
Roger!

55
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:06,815
[gasps] Are they unmanned?

56
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,943
[gasps] Eat this!

57
00:06:16,783 --> 00:06:17,992
These things are unmanned!

58
00:06:18,076 --> 00:06:20,036
Aim for the control
systems on their bridges!

59
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,621
[SPACE CAVALRY]
Roger!

60
00:06:21,705 --> 00:06:24,082
[KURATA]
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

61
00:06:24,165 --> 00:06:25,834
Don't hold back!

62
00:06:54,487 --> 00:06:56,614
I wonder if we all held out.

63
00:06:56,698 --> 00:06:58,033
[KURATA]
Deputy Commander.

64
00:06:58,116 --> 00:07:00,285
Scores of enemy reinforcements
ten kilometers ahead!

65
00:07:00,368 --> 00:07:01,828
What's that?

66
00:07:04,372 --> 00:07:06,624
[NAGAKURA]
There's... so many...

67
00:07:09,252 --> 00:07:11,087
[KURATA]
What now, Deputy Commander?

68
00:07:11,171 --> 00:07:14,382
[NAGAKURA] Isn't it obvious?
Don't let them get any closer!

69
00:07:14,466 --> 00:07:16,051
[KURATA]
Roger!

70
00:07:16,134 --> 00:07:18,386
We can't let the crew of the
<i>Yamato</i> down, no matter what!

71
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:20,722
[CAVALRY 14C] We'll finally get
the chance to repay our debts!

72
00:07:20,805 --> 00:07:21,973
[CAVALRY 14A]
You got that right!

73
00:07:22,057 --> 00:07:23,391
[CAVALRY 14B]
We put our lives in their hands,

74
00:07:23,475 --> 00:07:24,809
and now it's their turn!

75
00:07:24,893 --> 00:07:27,812
[SAITO] Hold on--I'm here!
Sorry I'm late, Nagakura.

76
00:07:27,896 --> 00:07:29,356
[NAGAKURA]
Commander!

77
00:07:29,439 --> 00:07:33,068
[SAITO] All troops, get out
of there, right now! Hurry up!

78
00:07:38,823 --> 00:07:41,868
Have a little taste of this!

79
00:07:49,125 --> 00:07:50,126
[NAGAKURA]
Commander!

80
00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:51,294
[SAITO]
The little guys are coming now.

81
00:07:51,378 --> 00:07:52,379
Watch out for those needles.

82
00:07:52,462 --> 00:07:54,089
[SPACE CAVALRY]
Roger!

83
00:07:56,341 --> 00:07:57,759
[growls]

84
00:08:20,323 --> 00:08:22,575
[ZURVIVAL laughs]

85
00:08:22,659 --> 00:08:24,577
They are quite good.

86
00:08:24,661 --> 00:08:26,955
Although, when humans
take action like this,

87
00:08:27,038 --> 00:08:29,791
there's always
an ulterior motive.

88
00:08:34,671 --> 00:08:37,799
[ZURVIVAL]
Helvestia Cannon... Fire!

89
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:53,064
They're onto us?

90
00:08:53,148 --> 00:08:55,608
Dammit! Why do we
have no precision?

91
00:08:55,692 --> 00:08:56,943
[HELVESTIA]
Half of the relay system

92
00:08:57,027 --> 00:08:58,862
was lost as a result
of the <i>Yamato</i> 's

93
00:08:58,945 --> 00:09:00,238
Wave Motion Gun attack.

94
00:09:00,321 --> 00:09:02,323
This is our highest
level of accuracy.

95
00:09:02,407 --> 00:09:04,325
I suppose it's just
a second-rate duplicate

96
00:09:04,409 --> 00:09:07,829
of old technology,
in the end. Damn!

97
00:09:13,585 --> 00:09:15,003
[KEYMAN]
The Reflecting Satellite Cannon.

98
00:09:15,086 --> 00:09:16,379
[SAIJO]
But why?

99
00:09:16,463 --> 00:09:19,007
[NANBU] Did they steal that
technology from Gamilas?

100
00:09:19,090 --> 00:09:20,425
Sure looks like it.

101
00:09:20,508 --> 00:09:22,927
They've taken Gamilan
scientists prisoner.

102
00:09:23,011 --> 00:09:25,013
They're using them
to develop weapons.

103
00:09:25,096 --> 00:09:26,181
If that's true,

104
00:09:26,264 --> 00:09:28,641
Lieutenant Keyman,
then the control system

105
00:09:28,725 --> 00:09:32,103
should be identical to the
one Gamilas uses, as well.

106
00:09:36,941 --> 00:09:38,234
[KEYMAN]
We don't have time to destroy

107
00:09:38,318 --> 00:09:40,820
the satellites one-by-one.
I've got an idea.

108
00:09:40,904 --> 00:09:42,864
We should aim for
the central control.

109
00:09:42,947 --> 00:09:44,949
So, if we just follow
their control signals,

110
00:09:45,033 --> 00:09:47,494
that'll lead us right
to the boss's location?

111
00:09:47,577 --> 00:09:48,912
[KEYMAN]
Cover me out there!

112
00:09:48,995 --> 00:09:50,455
[KATO]
Leave it to us!

113
00:09:53,416 --> 00:09:57,170
[SAITO] Fall back! All units
retreat to the rendezvous point!

114
00:10:08,723 --> 00:10:11,476
[SAIJO]
It's too dangerous! Evacuate!

115
00:10:11,559 --> 00:10:13,728
[SANADA]
Just a bit more.

116
00:10:18,942 --> 00:10:20,318
[KEYMAN]
Is that it?

117
00:10:28,159 --> 00:10:30,829
[KEYMAN] I was right--
it's an exact copy.

118
00:10:30,912 --> 00:10:32,497
[beeping]

119
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:34,624
[KEYMAN] Those who steal
ideas to do harm,

120
00:10:34,708 --> 00:10:37,002
must be punished accordingly.

121
00:10:37,085 --> 00:10:39,379
That's called justice.

122
00:10:54,102 --> 00:10:56,062
What just happened?

123
00:10:57,230 --> 00:11:02,193
[SAITO grunts]
Did we do it? Is it done?

124
00:11:02,277 --> 00:11:04,320
[SANADA]
Detonation, 300 seconds.

125
00:11:04,404 --> 00:11:06,364
[KODAI]
Okay! Withdraw!

126
00:11:07,991 --> 00:11:11,953
[KODAI] All crew, gather at the
rendezvous point immediately!

127
00:11:12,037 --> 00:11:15,206
[SAITO] You heard him! Move out!
The bedrock's gonna blow soon!

128
00:11:15,290 --> 00:11:16,416
It'll be felt on the surface.

129
00:11:16,499 --> 00:11:17,334
[NAGAKURA]
Commander!

130
00:11:17,417 --> 00:11:18,626
[SAITO]
Huh?

131
00:11:23,548 --> 00:11:27,052
[SAITO] So now they're bringin'
out the big guns, huh?

132
00:11:29,554 --> 00:11:31,348
[SAITO]
Get down! Now!

133
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:55,789
[SAITO]
Everyone all right?

134
00:11:57,165 --> 00:11:58,416
[NAGAKURA]
Confirming.

135
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,877
No vital readings
for Omiya or Yahata.

136
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:04,631
[growls] Anyone got
armaments left?

137
00:12:04,714 --> 00:12:07,300
[NAGAKURA] There's interference
from the Wave Motion Resonance.

138
00:12:07,384 --> 00:12:09,844
That means everyone
is down to 20% at most.

139
00:12:09,928 --> 00:12:14,057
[SAITO sighs] Understood.
In that case, we better retreat.

140
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:16,601
Get the hell outta here
before the next wave comes.

141
00:12:16,685 --> 00:12:17,560
[NAGAKURA]
Roger.

142
00:12:17,644 --> 00:12:18,603
[SAITO]
Nagakura.

143
00:12:18,687 --> 00:12:19,938
[NAGAKURA]
Yes, Commander?

144
00:12:20,021 --> 00:12:23,149
[SAITO] You lead 'em out.
I'll catch up soon.

145
00:12:27,987 --> 00:12:28,863
[SANADA]

...1!

150
00:12:48,008 --> 00:12:48,967
[HELVESTIA]
Shock waves spreading

151
00:12:49,050 --> 00:12:50,468
throughout the entire planet.

152
00:12:50,552 --> 00:12:53,805
The sealant rock is undergoing
a chain of total collapse.

153
00:12:53,888 --> 00:12:55,724
[growls]

154
00:12:55,807 --> 00:12:57,350
Huh?

155
00:12:57,434 --> 00:13:01,354
[SAITO yelling]

156
00:13:09,612 --> 00:13:11,406
[SAITO yells]

157
00:13:18,621 --> 00:13:19,831
[SAITO grunts]

158
00:13:22,876 --> 00:13:25,170
I am Zantz Zurvival.

159
00:13:25,253 --> 00:13:28,548
That is the name I
have proudly inherited.

00:13:28,631 --> 00:13:30,050
Who are you?

161
00:13:30,133 --> 00:13:34,471
Hajime Saito. Your people
killed my best men.

162
00:13:34,554 --> 00:13:36,056
I'm Space Cavalry.

163
00:13:36,139 --> 00:13:37,849
[laughs]

164

00:13:48,526 --> 00:13:49,903
[SAITO groans]

00:14:07,545 --> 00:14:08,880
[gasps]

167
00:14:27,023 --> 00:14:30,819
Self-destruct?
How dare you, coward?

168
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:06,396
[gasps]

169
00:15:14,738 --> 00:15:18,533
What the hell is the matter
with you? You idiot!

170
00:15:42,182 --> 00:15:44,100
[KODAI]
No obstacles detected ahead.

171
00:15:44,184 --> 00:15:47,354
We'll now begin the
descent into Terezarium.

172
00:15:47,437 --> 00:15:50,523
Right to the source
of Teresa's message.

173
00:15:50,607 --> 00:15:52,984
Be careful down there, Kodai.

174
00:15:53,068 --> 00:15:54,361
[KODAI]
Yes, sir.

175
00:16:12,337 --> 00:16:15,423
[KODAI] How can these grow?
There's no sunlight.

176
00:16:15,507 --> 00:16:19,469
[SAITO] No. That thing must give
off some kinda similar light.

177
00:16:20,387 --> 00:16:22,013
[KODAI]
This is it.

178
00:16:22,097 --> 00:16:25,392
[SANADA] Does that mean
she's in there? Teresa?

179
00:16:25,475 --> 00:16:26,851
I'm so curious.

180
00:16:26,935 --> 00:16:29,270
What was Gatlantis
trying to accomplish?

181
00:16:29,354 --> 00:16:31,231
[SAITO]
Look! Up there!

182
00:16:36,986 --> 00:16:38,405
[BOTH gasp]

183
00:16:44,494 --> 00:16:47,372
Uh! What the heck is goin' on?

184
00:16:51,543 --> 00:16:53,003
[KODAI gasps]

185
00:17:06,850 --> 00:17:10,103
Teresa! It must be!

186
00:17:19,571 --> 00:17:22,615
[TERESA]
I am Teresa.

187
00:17:22,699 --> 00:17:25,243
Teresa of Terezart.

188
00:17:26,453 --> 00:17:30,123
Hello. We received the
message that you sent.

189
00:17:30,206 --> 00:17:32,959
We came as soon as we could.

190
00:17:33,043 --> 00:17:35,295
Why did you choose us?

191
00:17:35,378 --> 00:17:39,591
I assume you could have sent the
call to anyone in the universe.

192
00:17:39,674 --> 00:17:43,219
I was not the one
who made that choice.

193
00:17:43,303 --> 00:17:46,639
It was already decided
that the <i>Yamato</i> would come.

194
00:17:46,723 --> 00:17:47,891
Already decided?

195
00:17:47,974 --> 00:17:49,392
What does that mean?

196
00:17:49,476 --> 00:17:50,894
Teresa.

197
00:17:50,977 --> 00:17:53,563
You are a high-dimensional
life form who exists

198
00:17:53,646 --> 00:17:57,317
on a much higher plane than
our own, is that correct?

199
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:59,736
High-dimensional life form?

200
00:18:00,612 --> 00:18:03,239
In order to be able
to hear your true voice,

201
00:18:03,323 --> 00:18:06,743
we had to locate the source of
your message and come to you.

202
00:18:06,826 --> 00:18:08,286
Is that correct?

203
00:18:08,370 --> 00:18:10,497
[TERESA]
Indeed.

204
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:13,333
A being may only discover
my true voice,

205
00:18:13,416 --> 00:18:16,628
when they are on the same
dimensional plane as me.

206
00:18:16,711 --> 00:18:18,546
Terezarium is a gate.

207
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:20,924
One created for that purpose.

208
00:18:21,007 --> 00:18:24,052
And your people, they
cast their bodies aside

209
00:18:24,135 --> 00:18:26,888
and passed into heaven
while still alive.

210
00:18:26,971 --> 00:18:29,641
You are the aggregate
of all their minds,

211
00:18:29,724 --> 00:18:31,393
and you exist on
the boundary between

212
00:18:31,476 --> 00:18:33,353
this world and the next.

213
00:18:33,436 --> 00:18:36,815
Able to see the whole universe
from beginning to end.

214
00:18:36,898 --> 00:18:37,941
Huh?

215
00:18:38,024 --> 00:18:39,567
Where she lives, is a realm

216
00:18:39,651 --> 00:18:41,945
where the inhabitants
can witness time.

217
00:18:42,028 --> 00:18:45,323
And, right now, we're standing
at the doorway to that world.

218
00:18:45,407 --> 00:18:46,700
The doorway?

219
00:18:46,783 --> 00:18:48,702
You mean, we're staring
right, square into the mouth

220
00:18:48,785 --> 00:18:50,453
of the River Styx?

221
00:18:51,538 --> 00:18:52,956
I'm confused.

222
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:55,875
Has the <i>Yamato</i> 's course
already been decided?

223
00:18:55,959 --> 00:18:57,460
The White Comet.

224
00:18:57,544 --> 00:19:00,505
Your people are aware of
such a thing, are you not?

225
00:19:00,588 --> 00:19:01,756
Yes.

226
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:04,551
We believe it to be the
Gatlantean home world.

227
00:19:04,634 --> 00:19:07,429
[TERESA] Actually, it's
something the ancient Aquarians

228
00:19:07,512 --> 00:19:10,015
left behind a very
long time ago.

229
00:19:10,098 --> 00:19:11,850
[ALL gasp]

230
00:19:11,933 --> 00:19:13,518
[TERESA] On one hand,
they sowed the seeds

231
00:19:13,601 --> 00:19:15,437
of humanity in the universe.

232
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:19,733
And, on the other, they prepared
a safety mechanism.

233
00:19:19,816 --> 00:19:24,154
If the seeds were bad, this
apparatus would reap them all.

234
00:19:24,237 --> 00:19:27,991
Leaving none, as a way of
protecting the universe.

235
00:19:28,074 --> 00:19:28,867
[gasps]

236
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:31,327
Then, that means Gatlantis...

237
00:19:31,411 --> 00:19:34,873
[TERESA] The goal of all
life forms is the same.

238
00:19:34,956 --> 00:19:37,292
To continue existing.

239
00:19:38,752 --> 00:19:41,171
[TERESA]
But Gatlantis is different.

240
00:19:41,254 --> 00:19:44,049
They awakened the ark
that governs destruction.

241
00:19:44,132 --> 00:19:47,844
They have a vendetta
against all human life.

242
00:19:47,927 --> 00:19:50,430
Until they eradicate
every trace of humanity

243
00:19:50,513 --> 00:19:52,349
that exists in the universe,

244
00:19:52,432 --> 00:19:55,560
their attacks will
continue without end.

245
00:19:58,271 --> 00:19:59,689
[TERESA]
So, it's up to you.

246
00:19:59,773 --> 00:20:03,777
Your people must rise up and
face the White Comet Empire.

247
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:07,572
Not just for Earth,
but for the sake of all life.

248
00:20:07,655 --> 00:20:09,949
For everything in
this dimension.

249
00:20:10,033 --> 00:20:12,160
How does it end?

250
00:20:12,243 --> 00:20:13,870
You can see everything, right?

251
00:20:13,953 --> 00:20:15,622
[KODAI]
Saito, stop.

252
00:20:15,705 --> 00:20:19,417
If I tell you,
the future will change.

253
00:20:19,501 --> 00:20:22,712
And thus, I mustn't interfere.

254
00:20:23,338 --> 00:20:25,131
[SAITO]
Who are those guys?

255
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:27,425
[TERESA] Those who have
left their physical bodies,

256
00:20:27,509 --> 00:20:29,386
should refrain from
involving themselves

257
00:20:29,469 --> 00:20:31,262
in the physical world.

258
00:20:31,971 --> 00:20:37,102
So, all that I am permitted
to do is to pray for life.

259
00:20:37,185 --> 00:20:39,521
[SANADA] A mechanism
of absolute destruction

260
00:20:39,604 --> 00:20:41,815
left behind by the
god-like civilization

261
00:20:41,898 --> 00:20:44,567
that created intelligent life.

262
00:20:44,651 --> 00:20:46,986
Even if we assembled
all Earth's armies,

263
00:20:47,070 --> 00:20:49,322
we're not sure we
could defeat them.

264
00:20:49,406 --> 00:20:50,907
A hint.

265
00:20:50,990 --> 00:20:54,369
Could you at least give us some
clue about how to fight them?

266
00:20:58,373 --> 00:20:59,874
--[KODAI, SANADA gasp]
--[SAITO] Whoa!

267
00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:02,836
[TERESA] You were able
to find your way here.

268
00:21:02,919 --> 00:21:06,131
There's a hint.
Do you know what it means?

269
00:21:06,214 --> 00:21:08,174
It's a sign we're connected.

270
00:21:08,258 --> 00:21:11,469
That I have a powerful
bond with your people.

271
00:21:12,887 --> 00:21:16,474
And the <i>Yamato.</i>
It's a great harmony.

272
00:21:16,558 --> 00:21:18,351
[KODAI]
A "great harmony"?

273
00:21:18,435 --> 00:21:21,813
It's a field,
created by our lives.

274
00:21:21,896 --> 00:21:25,275
Those of us connected by
these prevailing bonds.

275
00:21:25,358 --> 00:21:28,319
Bonds are what we call the
energies that connect beings

276
00:21:28,403 --> 00:21:30,655
across space and time.

277
00:21:30,739 --> 00:21:33,158
Tangible forces,
akin to gravity.

278
00:21:33,241 --> 00:21:35,744
They tie phenomena together,

279
00:21:35,827 --> 00:21:39,456
and can even act across
dimensional boundary lines.

280
00:21:39,539 --> 00:21:40,874
[gasps]

281
00:21:41,708 --> 00:21:43,376
The power of bonds

282
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:47,130
transcends all the physical
laws of the universe.

283
00:21:47,213 --> 00:21:50,884
No matter how violent the forces
acting against them may be,

284
00:21:50,967 --> 00:21:54,262
these bonds can never
be fully eradicated.

285
00:21:56,806 --> 00:21:58,308
[TERESA]
The bonds that are associated

286
00:21:58,391 --> 00:22:01,394
with that great harmony.
The <i>Yamato.</i>

287
00:22:01,478 --> 00:22:06,107
Have the power needed to
stop the ark of destruction.

288
00:22:06,191 --> 00:22:07,859
[KODAI]
Teresa...

289
00:22:07,942 --> 00:22:10,028
Bonds grow, as well.

290
00:22:10,111 --> 00:22:13,740
And sometimes... this
can be a painful process.

291
00:22:16,910 --> 00:22:20,038
He will grow, like you.

[DESLER] It's been far too long,
people of the <i>Yamato.</i>

295
00:25:15,839 --> 00:25:19,300
[KODAI] Why don't we end this
now, Supreme Leader Desler?

[DESLER] Oh, it has yet
to even begin, boy.

So, how do you plan to end it?
