1
00:01:57,315 --> 00:01:59,192
[ZEMURIAN CHILD 20A]
The moment it is destroyed,

2
00:01:59,275 --> 00:02:01,319
Golem will begin to sing.

3
00:02:02,904 --> 00:02:04,489
[ZEMURIAN CHILD 20B]
The tune is one that kills off

4
00:02:04,572 --> 00:02:08,702
artificial cells and causes
wholesale destruction.

5
00:02:08,785 --> 00:02:09,911
[ZEMURIAN CHILD 20A]
The effects will be felt

6
00:02:09,994 --> 00:02:12,539
in every corner of the universe.

7
00:02:43,611 --> 00:02:45,697
[SOLDIER 25A]
Gatlantean Fleet is in disarray.

8
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:47,115
Radio is out, too.

9
00:02:47,198 --> 00:02:49,242
[SOLDIER 25B]
They've completely lost control.

10
00:02:49,325 --> 00:02:50,952
Finally.

11
00:02:51,036 --> 00:02:51,995
All ships, move!

12
00:02:52,078 --> 00:02:54,164
Withdraw from the battlefront.

13
00:03:30,283 --> 00:03:32,410
[ZWORDER]
I suspected this.

14
00:03:32,494 --> 00:03:35,789
As a Gatlantean who has eaten
of the Fruit of Knowledge,

15
00:03:35,872 --> 00:03:38,375
I cannot accompany them.

16
00:03:59,437 --> 00:04:01,106
[SANADA]
Kodai, do you read me?

17
00:04:01,189 --> 00:04:03,650
Have the assault team
withdraw quickly.

18
00:04:03,733 --> 00:04:04,693
What now?

19
00:04:04,776 --> 00:04:06,861
This isn't the work
of Golem alone.

20
00:04:06,945 --> 00:04:10,490
Some unknown entity is
destroying the City Empire.

21
00:04:10,573 --> 00:04:13,535
It's absorbing every object
and scrap of energy.

22
00:04:15,453 --> 00:04:16,996
[gasps]

23
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:19,124
[SANADA]
It can't be.

24
00:04:19,207 --> 00:04:21,918
The Ark of Destruction
is beginning to devour

25
00:04:22,002 --> 00:04:24,254
the City Empire itself.

26
00:04:28,675 --> 00:04:30,802
[SANADA] Lieutenant Keyman,
return to the ship!

27
00:04:30,885 --> 00:04:32,262
At this rate,
the <i>Yamato</i> will be--

28
00:04:32,345 --> 00:04:33,888
[KEYMAN]
XO Sanada.

29
00:04:35,015 --> 00:04:36,933
[KEYMAN]
I have an idea.

30
00:04:39,811 --> 00:04:42,689
[ZWORDER]
The extermination of evil races.

31
00:04:42,772 --> 00:04:46,776
In order to fulfill the duty
given to it by its creators,

32
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:49,529
the Ark of Destruction
is always evolving,

33
00:04:49,612 --> 00:04:53,450
always seeking the optimal
form for the current moment.

34
00:04:56,327 --> 00:04:58,246
[ZWORDER]
This evolution will continue,

35
00:04:58,329 --> 00:05:02,792
whether the Gatlanteans are
there to witness it or not.

36
00:05:02,876 --> 00:05:07,172
All that is required is a judge
to bring on the destruction.

37
00:05:11,343 --> 00:05:13,261
It needs a human will.

38
00:05:13,345 --> 00:05:14,804
No, wait!

39
00:05:14,888 --> 00:05:17,766
I, Zworder, am human!

40
00:05:17,849 --> 00:05:20,310
Hear me, Ark of Destruction!

41
00:05:20,393 --> 00:05:23,855
It is time for your
true awakening!

42
00:05:41,706 --> 00:05:44,000
[SAITO]
Kodai! You okay?

43
00:05:44,084 --> 00:05:47,879
[ZWORDER laughing]

44
00:05:47,962 --> 00:05:49,172
Please, no!

45
00:05:49,255 --> 00:05:51,424
Stop this, Zworder!

46
00:05:57,806 --> 00:05:59,724
[KODAI]
Don't do it!

47
00:06:02,143 --> 00:06:03,937
[SAITO]
Come on! We need to go!

48
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:08,066
[KODAI]
No!

49
00:06:31,506 --> 00:06:33,925
[AIHARA] Assault team,
withdraw immediately!

50
00:06:34,009 --> 00:06:36,511
<i>Yamato</i> 's engines have
sustained serious damage!

51
00:06:36,594 --> 00:06:39,556
Engine pressure is
rising, almost critical!

52
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:42,600
[growls] This hasn't
happened before.

53
00:06:42,684 --> 00:06:44,728
Who knows how long she'll hold?

54
00:06:45,895 --> 00:06:47,647
[SHIMA]

55
00:06:47,731 --> 00:06:49,482

[GAMILAN SOLDIER 25A]
Everything is being sucked into

57
00:06:50,817 --> 00:06:53,153
the opening near
the gravity source.

58
00:06:53,236 --> 00:06:54,237
[GAMILAN SOLDIER 25B]
Energy readings at the

59
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:57,824
City Empire's core
are still rising.

60
00:06:57,907 --> 00:06:59,659
There it is.

61
00:06:59,743 --> 00:07:01,911
The Ark of Destruction.

00:07:14,883 --> 00:07:15,633
[SANADA]
Kodai.

63
00:07:15,717 --> 00:07:17,677
[KODAI]
Sanada?

64
00:07:17,761 --> 00:07:20,221
[SANADA] If we want to
put a stop to this,

65
00:07:20,305 --> 00:07:22,390
we have just one chance.

66
00:07:23,683 --> 00:07:26,394
Before the energy
transmutation is finished,

67
00:07:26,478 --> 00:07:28,480
someone must
approach the reactor

68
00:07:28,563 --> 00:07:31,107
and blow it up from the inside.

69
00:07:31,191 --> 00:07:33,068
It's the only way.

70
00:07:33,151 --> 00:07:34,986
From inside.

71
00:07:39,783 --> 00:07:40,992
[KODAI]

00:07:42,869 --> 00:07:46,623
[KEYMAN]
Bonds. They drive us all.

On this plane is the last of

the Wave Motion
Excavator Warheads.

Keep him safe.

There is still so
much he has to do--

93

Be selfish for once.

00:09:00,405 --> 00:09:02,282
[YAMAMOTO]
You're always like this.

95

Living for others.

96

Unable to live for yourself.

[YAMAMOTO]
I can't take it anymore.

[SAITO]
No, it's not.

100
00:09:15,211 --> 00:09:17,172
The way I figure it,
the people who can

101
00:09:17,255 --> 00:09:20,633
only live for themselves are
the ones who're really sad.

102
00:09:20,717 --> 00:09:22,135
Y'know?

103
00:09:22,218 --> 00:09:24,137
Everyone goes through
life hoping to find

104
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:26,806
something that's truly
precious to them.

105
00:09:28,099 --> 00:09:29,768
[SAITO]
Something irreplaceable.

106
00:09:29,851 --> 00:09:32,854
Something they would
rather die than lose.

107
00:09:34,397 --> 00:09:37,817
[SAITO chuckles]
So, what else can I do?

108
00:09:37,901 --> 00:09:40,945
I've found that precious thing.

[KEYMAN]
Akira, you may disagree,

121
00:10:37,043 --> 00:10:40,130
but I've never thought
of my life as a sad one.

122
00:10:42,841 --> 00:10:45,051
[KEYMAN]
I have known the pain of loss,

but only because I had
something to lose.

124

Still.

[KEYMAN] I am sad that I
cannot hear your voice now.

for everything gained,

00:15:19,909 --> 00:15:22,245
are more painful than dying.

163
00:15:33,757 --> 00:15:36,676
[KODAI] Difficult as it is,
people must live on.

164
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:38,136
[SHIMA gasps]

165
00:15:40,638 --> 00:15:41,973
Kodai.

166
00:15:46,353 --> 00:15:48,104
Kodai stayed behind!

167
00:15:49,189 --> 00:15:51,483
[KODAI]
We must keep fighting

168
00:15:51,566 --> 00:15:54,652
for as long as there is
still a shred of hope.

169
00:16:03,244 --> 00:16:05,163
[KODAI]
I've heard about the G Plan.

170
00:16:05,246 --> 00:16:08,166
I want you to escape
the solar system at once.

171
00:16:08,249 --> 00:16:10,627
You must seek out a new Earth.

172
00:16:11,711 --> 00:16:12,504
Wait, no!

173
00:16:12,587 --> 00:16:14,047
What about you, Captain Kodai?

174
00:16:14,130 --> 00:16:15,215
We can't just--

175
00:16:31,022 --> 00:16:32,565
[KODAI]
Okita.

176
00:16:34,776 --> 00:16:38,363
I'll apologize
on the other side.

177
00:16:42,283 --> 00:16:43,410
[door opens]

178

[gasps]

179
00:16:45,829 --> 00:16:47,497
[KODAI]
Yuki!

180
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:49,082
But why?

181
00:16:51,334 --> 00:16:53,378
You shouldn't be here!

182
00:16:56,047 --> 00:16:58,967
If I weren't,
who would navigate?

183
00:16:59,050 --> 00:17:00,385
The Ark.

184
00:17:00,468 --> 00:17:02,262
We'll ram the <i>Yamato</i> in there.

185
00:17:02,345 --> 00:17:03,430
[KODAI gasps]

186
00:17:03,513 --> 00:17:04,931
[YUKI]
Even throwing a near-critical

187
00:17:05,015 --> 00:17:06,808
Wave Motion Engine at it,

188
00:17:06,891 --> 00:17:09,436
we can't sink something
with that mass.

189
00:17:09,519 --> 00:17:13,565
But, before the enemy
finishes replenishing energy,

190
00:17:13,648 --> 00:17:17,152
if we just buy some time,
then more people can escape,

191
00:17:17,235 --> 00:17:19,946
and fewer will die when
it strikes the Earth.

192
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:21,990
Are you sure?

193
00:17:22,073 --> 00:17:23,825
[YUKI]
It's true.

194
00:17:23,908 --> 00:17:26,953
My memories of you are all gone.

195
00:17:27,037 --> 00:17:29,456
But still. I know you.

196
00:17:29,539 --> 00:17:32,709
And I know that's
what you're thinking.

197
00:17:32,792 --> 00:17:35,045
Yuki.

198
00:17:35,128 --> 00:17:39,007
[YUKI]
Kodai, you can't do this alone.

199
00:18:07,869 --> 00:18:10,205
The <i>Yamato</i> . It's...

200
00:18:10,288 --> 00:18:12,374
They've given us a gift.

201
00:18:12,457 --> 00:18:14,959
Let's speed up the evacuation!

202
00:18:16,795 --> 00:18:19,130
[ZWORDER]
One thousand years ago,

203
00:18:19,214 --> 00:18:22,175
you awakened the
Ark of Destruction.

204
00:18:23,176 --> 00:18:26,221
[ZWORDER] Do you know why
you were able to do that?

205
00:18:27,847 --> 00:18:30,517
[ZWORDER]
Because you are human.

206
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,560
Because you are human,

207
00:18:32,644 --> 00:18:36,189
you curse people and
seek to destroy them.

208
00:18:37,399 --> 00:18:39,192
[ZWORDER]
Because you are human,

209
00:18:39,275 --> 00:18:43,988
you love people and
seek to protect them.

210
00:18:44,072 --> 00:18:45,240
Wave Motion Engine.

211
00:18:45,323 --> 00:18:47,659
Pressure at 200 percent.

212
00:18:47,742 --> 00:18:50,120
The reactor is about
to go critical,

213
00:18:50,203 --> 00:18:53,623
but we should be able to make it
inside the Ark of Destruction.

214
00:19:18,857 --> 00:19:20,900
You feel so warm.

215
00:19:23,403 --> 00:19:25,655
Yuki.

216
00:19:25,739 --> 00:19:27,991
Kodai, I...

217
00:19:35,248 --> 00:19:37,334
[BOTH gasp]

218
00:19:55,310 --> 00:19:57,354
That light, could it be?

219
00:20:01,441 --> 00:20:03,109
Teresa.

220
00:20:04,277 --> 00:20:07,947
[TERESA] Memories are
just an accumulation.

221
00:20:08,031 --> 00:20:12,035
Emotions are what create the
true bonds between people.

222
00:20:23,922 --> 00:20:28,051
[TERESA]
Everything is the work of bonds.

223
00:20:28,134 --> 00:20:32,430
I am only here now because
of my bond with you.

224
00:20:35,392 --> 00:20:37,852
When the Wave Motion
Engine melted down,

225
00:20:37,936 --> 00:20:40,647
it opened a hole leading
into a higher dimension,

226
00:20:40,730 --> 00:20:43,400
bringing out Teresa.

227
00:20:43,483 --> 00:20:49,698
A one-in-a-hundred-million
chance, or was this inevitable?

228
00:20:49,781 --> 00:20:54,994
We humans created a vessel to
bring Teresa into this universe.

229
00:20:55,078 --> 00:20:56,663
The <i>Yamato</i> .

230
00:20:57,872 --> 00:21:01,418
[TERESA] Sometimes, strong
emotions can change a destiny

231
00:21:01,501 --> 00:21:03,920
that has already
been established.

232
00:21:06,381 --> 00:21:08,508
[TERESA] But for such
a reversal to occur,

233
00:21:08,591 --> 00:21:11,177
everything must be in place.

234
00:21:18,643 --> 00:21:20,937
[TERESA]
If any of you had been missing,

235
00:21:21,021 --> 00:21:23,273
I could not have come here.

236
00:21:37,412 --> 00:21:41,916
[TERESA] Like you, I am a
part of the Great Harmony.

237
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:47,255
Let us go together and discover
the destiny that awaits us.

238
00:25:49,581 --> 00:25:51,124
[KODAI]
I pulled the trigger.

239
00:25:51,207 --> 00:25:52,000
[YUKI]
Kodai, no!

240
00:25:52,083 --> 00:25:53,084
[SAKI]
What a mess.

241
00:25:53,168 --> 00:25:55,962
[SANADA]
Perhaps we are being tested.

242
00:25:56,046 --> 00:25:57,297
[SHIMA]
We've got work to do.

243
00:25:57,380 --> 00:25:59,758
[TERESA] It is all decided
by people's feelings.

244
00:25:59,841 --> 00:26:03,511
If you wish it, the world
you hope for will...
