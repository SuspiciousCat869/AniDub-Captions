1
00:01:52,352 --> 00:01:54,479
[SHINOHARA]
It's practically a graveyard.

2
00:01:54,562 --> 00:01:59,818
No infrared or radar response.
No signs of repair, either.

3
00:01:59,901 --> 00:02:04,572
They're just floating, right
where their engines died.

4
00:02:04,656 --> 00:02:07,200
[SANADA] That may be the
sort of people they are.

5
00:02:07,283 --> 00:02:08,368
[SHIMA]
Huh?

6
00:02:08,451 --> 00:02:10,078
[SANADA]
Adept at causing destruction,

7
00:02:10,161 --> 00:02:13,498
but unable to create
or repair anything.

8
00:02:14,416 --> 00:02:16,334
So? What's our move?

9
00:02:16,418 --> 00:02:20,213
It's far too dangerous to wait
here for the rescue fleet.

10
00:02:20,296 --> 00:02:23,049
I say let's take the colonists
to Earth ourselves.

11
00:02:23,133 --> 00:02:27,345
[TOKUGAWA] Yes, normally that
would be the right decision.

12
00:02:27,429 --> 00:02:29,806
[SHIMA] But it would
throw us off schedule.

13
00:02:29,889 --> 00:02:32,225
There are other options.

14
00:02:33,309 --> 00:02:34,686
[KEYMAN]
That's on the way to Terezart,

15
00:02:34,769 --> 00:02:37,355
around 1,800 light
years from here.

16
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:39,357
[SHIMA] You're talking about
the planet Stravase.

17
00:02:39,441 --> 00:02:42,736
[KEYMAN] Tomorrow, Gamilans
heading for Earth will pass it.

18
00:02:42,819 --> 00:02:44,738
That presents a
golden opportunity.

19
00:02:44,821 --> 00:02:47,282
So you wanna hand over
the colonists to that fleet?

20
00:02:47,365 --> 00:02:49,451
You sure they
would take them on?

21
00:02:49,534 --> 00:02:52,120
It's a regular trip
from Gamilas to Earth.

22
00:02:52,203 --> 00:02:54,164
The fleet has no
urgent business.

23
00:02:54,247 --> 00:02:58,460
If we explain things,
I'm confident they will.

24
00:02:58,543 --> 00:03:02,714
Terezart needs help as well.
The <i>Yamato</i> should keep moving.

25
00:03:11,348 --> 00:03:14,476
[SAITO]
You saved more than 200 lives.

26
00:03:14,559 --> 00:03:18,563
Still, more than ten times that
were killed in the attacks.

27
00:03:18,646 --> 00:03:20,565
They slaughtered
indiscriminately...

28
00:03:20,648 --> 00:03:23,318
Elderly and children.

29
00:03:23,401 --> 00:03:25,737
That's the kinda enemy
we're up against.

30
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:27,947
An enemy you let go.

31
00:03:28,031 --> 00:03:29,824
Look, I don't know
what kind of promise

32
00:03:29,908 --> 00:03:32,535
you and your crew
made at Iscandar,

33
00:03:32,619 --> 00:03:35,372
but I hope you'll at
least remember that.

34
00:04:00,814 --> 00:04:02,982
[cracks]

35
00:04:04,693 --> 00:04:07,737
Good to have you
back, Professor.

36
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:11,408
[SHIMA] He says it's a
routine trip to Earth.

37
00:04:11,491 --> 00:04:13,618
The name of the
planet is Stravase.

38
00:04:13,702 --> 00:04:15,995
Understood, but let's
check the course.

39
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:17,706
We'll use the first bridge.

40
00:04:17,789 --> 00:04:19,457
Sounds good.

41
00:04:19,541 --> 00:04:20,792
Oh, sorry.

42
00:04:23,128 --> 00:04:25,130
[KODAI gasping]

43
00:04:32,804 --> 00:04:34,931
[WOMAN]
Will you take this, please?

44
00:04:37,642 --> 00:04:39,144
[gasps]

45
00:04:41,271 --> 00:04:42,105
Kodai?!

46
00:04:42,188 --> 00:04:44,024
Uh. Doctor!

47
00:04:44,107 --> 00:04:47,027
[gasps] Hold on!

48
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:50,405
Kodai's here, and he
doesn't look happy.

49
00:04:50,488 --> 00:04:51,781
Dr. Sado!

50
00:04:51,865 --> 00:04:52,991
Please, Acting Captain,

51
00:04:53,074 --> 00:04:56,327
there's no shouting
in the treatment room.

52
00:04:56,411 --> 00:04:59,539
All right. Who're you?

53
00:04:59,622 --> 00:05:01,499
Earth Federation Defense Force.

54
00:05:01,583 --> 00:05:04,961
Central Management
Division. Yuki Mori.

55
00:05:05,045 --> 00:05:07,339
Well that's funny, your name
isn't on the crew list.

56
00:05:07,422 --> 00:05:09,215
Uh, I must have forgotten
to register her.

57
00:05:09,299 --> 00:05:10,717
I'm terrible at bookkeeping.

58
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,095
We can't go breaking protocol,
Doctor. She's not staying.

59
00:05:14,179 --> 00:05:15,138
[DR. SADO grunts]

60
00:05:15,221 --> 00:05:16,765
[MORI]
Very well then. I'll leave.

61
00:05:16,848 --> 00:05:19,934
Uh! I'm confused, what kind
of game are you two playing?

62
00:05:20,018 --> 00:05:22,896
Doctor, could you
take this, please?

63
00:05:24,022 --> 00:05:25,607
[DR. SADO]
Listen, this was my mistake.

64
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:29,277
Just do me a favor and try
not to throw anything.

65
00:05:29,361 --> 00:05:30,737
[SAIJO]
Attention, all crew.

66
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:33,406
We are scheduled to
embark at 11-30 hours.

67
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:36,451
Operation Division crewmembers,
please check your designated

68
00:05:36,534 --> 00:05:39,746
civilian accommodation
zones by 0900.

69
00:05:48,922 --> 00:05:51,424
[KODAI gasping]
What are you doing?

70
00:05:51,508 --> 00:05:54,177
I'm following orders.
You told me to go.

71
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:56,805
Uh. Would you just slow down?

72
00:05:56,888 --> 00:05:58,014
What's your plan?

73
00:05:58,098 --> 00:05:59,641
How would you get back
to Earth from here?

74
00:05:59,724 --> 00:06:02,394
You're the one who told me
to "get off this ship."

75
00:06:02,477 --> 00:06:05,063
If I have to,
I'll spacewalk back.

76
00:06:05,146 --> 00:06:06,856
What? That's crazy!

77
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:08,608
Come on.

78
00:06:11,861 --> 00:06:13,530
[HIJIKATA]
Dr. Sado.

79
00:06:13,613 --> 00:06:15,407
What is it, Admiral?

80
00:06:16,783 --> 00:06:19,536
I have this feeling.

81
00:06:19,619 --> 00:06:24,290
It's like Okita is still
onboard this ship.

82
00:06:24,374 --> 00:06:27,544
[DR. SADO] Maybe he'll get off
soon with the other passengers.

83
00:06:27,627 --> 00:06:29,170
Uh...

84
00:06:30,547 --> 00:06:33,091
But the rest of this crew
are still so young.

85
00:06:33,174 --> 00:06:34,759
I think they could
use the wisdom

86
00:06:34,843 --> 00:06:38,471
of an old man to support them.

87
00:06:38,555 --> 00:06:40,890
Well, take care, sir.

88
00:06:48,398 --> 00:06:52,235
Not me. I'm a broken man.

89
00:06:58,074 --> 00:06:59,200
[SHIMA]
You're a mess.

[KODAI gasps]

91
00:07:00,785 --> 00:07:03,204
You're clearly too tense to
handle all of this pressure.

92
00:07:03,288 --> 00:07:05,582
Your nerves can't take it.

93
00:07:05,665 --> 00:07:07,208
[KODAI]
That's none of your business.

94
00:07:07,292 --> 00:07:09,085
[SHIMA]
Kodai. Listen,

95
00:07:09,169 --> 00:07:11,504
when that distress signal
came from Terezart,

96
00:07:11,588 --> 00:07:14,132
everybody saw a vision, right?

97
00:07:15,175 --> 00:07:17,218
Show your resolve.

98
00:07:18,511 --> 00:07:22,682
[SHIMA] I've been asking myself,
"what if we hadn't seen it?"

99
00:07:22,766 --> 00:07:25,060
Would we still have
boarded this ship?

100
00:07:31,649 --> 00:07:34,444
[YAMAMOTO] So you decided
to show your face, huh?

101
00:07:34,527 --> 00:07:36,863
[MORI] Sorry. After what
you all did to hide me,

102
00:07:36,946 --> 00:07:38,490
I hope you're not mad.

103
00:07:38,573 --> 00:07:40,200
[YAMAMOTO]
Of course not,

104
00:07:40,283 --> 00:07:43,119
you know the <i>Yamato</i> women
always have each other's backs.

105
00:07:43,203 --> 00:07:44,704
But tell me. Why now?

106
00:07:44,788 --> 00:07:47,832
Well, I didn't want to miss
this chance for fresh air.

107
00:07:47,916 --> 00:07:49,084
And besides...

108
00:07:49,167 --> 00:07:50,585
[YAMAMOTO]
Hm?

109
00:07:52,379 --> 00:07:55,548
I'm worried this could
get too... hard.

110
00:07:55,632 --> 00:08:00,220
Huh. Too hard for
Kodai, you mean?

111
00:08:00,303 --> 00:08:02,097
And for me... I guess.

112
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:03,848
[YAMAMOTO]
Huh...?

113
00:08:03,932 --> 00:08:08,478
He knows I came now, but I still
may not be able to help him.

114
00:08:08,561 --> 00:08:10,438
I don't want to be a burden.

115
00:08:10,522 --> 00:08:16,236
So if he tells me to go,
then this time I will.

116
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:21,741
But I thought I would at least
try and say, "I'm here."

[YAMAMOTO]
I'm jealous.

120
00:08:30,917 --> 00:08:33,670
Unlike us, Mori wasn't
called to save Terezart.

121
00:08:33,753 --> 00:08:37,716
Even so, she made the choice
to come. What does that say?

122
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:40,760
Hold on! You mean you knew?!

123
00:08:40,844 --> 00:08:44,097
Be honest with yourself.
We support the ones we love.

124
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:45,682
There's no shame in that.

125
00:08:45,765 --> 00:08:48,143
So you can talk about
military protocol,

126
00:08:48,226 --> 00:08:50,437
but it's the <i>Yamato.</i>

127

So what's the problem? We've
broken the rules before, right?

As soon as we land on Stravase,

00:09:48,995 --> 00:09:52,665
our XO will go to the Gamilans
and confirm the arrangements.

If there are no issues, we'll

The civilians and Space Cavalry

you to lead the mission.

00:10:44,801 --> 00:10:46,678
Thank you, Commander Saito.

159
00:10:46,761 --> 00:10:50,974
Sure. Then after that,
it's right back to the front.

160
00:10:51,057 --> 00:10:52,684
That's our brave leader.

161
00:10:52,767 --> 00:10:54,686
Honestly, the guy can't
think of anything to do

162
00:10:54,769 --> 00:10:58,314
with his life outside
of revenge.

163
00:10:58,398 --> 00:11:00,775
Saito. Can we talk?

164
00:11:09,034 --> 00:11:10,201
[gasps]

165
00:11:14,247 --> 00:11:16,916
[SAITO] You've got a brave
woman there, Kodai.

166
00:11:31,723 --> 00:11:33,224
[REDROWZ]
That's it!

167
00:11:33,308 --> 00:11:36,353
The alien ruins of Stravase we
heard about from the Gamilans!

168
00:11:36,436 --> 00:11:39,356
If given the chance, we could
understand the mystery

169
00:11:39,439 --> 00:11:43,610
of the ancient Aquarian
civilization! And yet...

170
00:11:43,693 --> 00:11:45,195
Professor...

171
00:11:45,987 --> 00:11:47,447
[REDROWZ]
Huh?

172
00:11:47,530 --> 00:11:50,867
A man creates his
own chances, right?

173
00:11:57,499 --> 00:12:00,126
[SAIJO] Gamilan fleet is
approaching rendezvous point

174
00:12:00,210 --> 00:12:01,753
right on schedule.

175
00:12:13,139 --> 00:12:14,391
[REFUGEES chattering]

176
00:12:14,474 --> 00:12:17,560
[HIRATA] Don't push.
There's no need to rush.

177
00:12:23,858 --> 00:12:25,443
[SANADA]
This helps us immensely.

178
00:12:25,527 --> 00:12:28,238
Though I do feel guilty for
putting this task on you.

179
00:12:28,321 --> 00:12:29,948
It should be our job.

180
00:12:30,031 --> 00:12:32,867
We'll take good care of them.
And don't forget,

181
00:12:32,951 --> 00:12:34,619
Terezart's one of
the great mysteries

182
00:12:34,703 --> 00:12:36,996
in Gamilan history, as well.

183
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:40,625
If this helps you get there,
it's the least we can do.

184
00:12:42,585 --> 00:12:45,422
[KARZET]
Oh, Lieutenant Keyman.

185
00:12:45,505 --> 00:12:49,384
I wanted to ask you about your
replacement at the embassy.

186
00:12:49,467 --> 00:12:51,636
You take your time;
I can go on ahead.

187
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:54,347
[KEYMAN]
Thank you, XO.

188
00:13:02,647 --> 00:13:04,524
[KARZET] We are ashamed
that you must take on

189
00:13:04,607 --> 00:13:06,735
such a dangerous mission
yourself, sir.

190
00:13:06,818 --> 00:13:10,196
You can spare me the groveling.
Did you bring what I asked?

191
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:13,074
Yes, sir. It's not that
I doubted your plan

192
00:13:13,158 --> 00:13:15,285
to aid our cause
with the <i>Yamato,</i>

193
00:13:15,368 --> 00:13:18,204
I'm just surprised it
could go this well.

194
00:13:18,288 --> 00:13:20,540
Clearly you share
the great blessings

195
00:13:20,623 --> 00:13:22,042
of your superior bloodline.

196
00:13:22,125 --> 00:13:23,585
No, that's irrelevant.

197
00:13:23,668 --> 00:13:26,713
Simply put: Objects in
motion gain momentum.

198
00:13:26,796 --> 00:13:28,256
Show me.

199
00:13:31,676 --> 00:13:33,553
[KARZET]
It's just as you requested.

200
00:13:33,636 --> 00:13:36,639
It can control the <i>Yamato</i> 's
Wave Motion Engine,

201
00:13:36,723 --> 00:13:38,933
and destroy it, too.

202
00:13:39,768 --> 00:13:42,854
[KEYMAN]
The Anti-Wave Motion Lattice.

203
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:46,900
[HIRATA] It's dangerous out
here, so please stay in line.

204
00:13:46,983 --> 00:13:47,650
[gasps]

205
00:13:47,734 --> 00:13:51,112
Uh! Hey, hold on! Uh...

206
00:13:51,196 --> 00:13:52,614
[GIRL 3A]
Miss!

207
00:13:53,656 --> 00:13:56,826
You're gonna get on one of
the ships like us, aren't you?

208
00:13:56,910 --> 00:13:58,661
Yes, of course.

209
00:13:58,745 --> 00:14:01,623
Can I see you again,
once we're on Earth?

210
00:14:01,706 --> 00:14:02,374
[TOKO]
Certainly.

211
00:14:02,457 --> 00:14:04,084
[laughs]

212
00:14:12,509 --> 00:14:13,843
[TOKO gasping]

213
00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:22,102
It is a little heavy.

214
00:14:22,185 --> 00:14:25,730
But this way we can communicate
whenever we want.

215
00:14:25,814 --> 00:14:28,066
It'll even work if we're
on different ships.

216
00:14:28,149 --> 00:14:30,527
Beats the heck out of borrowing
radios from the Gamilans

217
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:32,570
every time we want to
talk, don't you think?

218
00:14:32,654 --> 00:14:34,739
Yes, it's a big help. Still...

219
00:14:34,823 --> 00:14:37,742
Are you sure the Cavalry can
spare this equipment for me?

220
00:14:37,826 --> 00:14:41,496
Don't worry about it.
Plus, Commander said so.

221
00:14:46,459 --> 00:14:48,503
I guess this is
a farewell drink?

222
00:14:48,586 --> 00:14:50,839
That's right,
we're partin' ways.

223
00:14:50,922 --> 00:14:53,466
Though I can't say
I understand why.

224
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:55,468
[HIJIKATA]
Hm...

225
00:14:55,552 --> 00:14:58,263
[SAITO] The <i>Yamato</i> 's
become a coward's ship.

226
00:14:58,346 --> 00:15:02,517
This crew lacks the backbone to
crush the enemy. It's pathetic.

227
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:03,601
I'm goin' back to Earth

228
00:15:03,685 --> 00:15:06,146
and jumpin' onto a ship
that can fight.

229
00:15:06,229 --> 00:15:09,441
Figured you would feel
the same way, Old Man.

230
00:15:10,984 --> 00:15:15,113
This ship--it bears the
spirit of my closest friend

231
00:15:15,196 --> 00:15:17,782
and the best man
I've ever known.

232
00:15:22,495 --> 00:15:25,165
It's my turn to watch over it.

233
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:50,315
Almost time. The colonists
should be embarking shortly.

234
00:15:50,398 --> 00:15:52,817
You know, one of us
should say something.

235
00:15:52,901 --> 00:15:54,694
A parting message for them.

236
00:15:54,778 --> 00:15:56,988
That does seem
appropriate, Chief.

237
00:15:57,072 --> 00:15:58,823
Maybe from the acting captain?

238

Professor Redrowz was in there!

He what? You're
telling me a civilian

is headed for the

Militant reactionaries?

While it's true they're
from Gamilas,

they're political criminals
opposing our world's policies.

We've had conflicts with
them from time to time,

show up on a course to Earth.

[GAMILAN LEADER 8A]
Emperor Desler is dead,

rules over Gamilas like a ghost

haunting us from
beyond the grave.

As Gamilans it is
our responsibility

to liberate the planets
trampled by our people.

board, we launch!

315
00:20:56,579 --> 00:21:00,000
Engineering, activate
the flywheel now.

316
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:08,800
--[beeping]
--[TOKUGAWA] Hm?

317
00:21:09,634 --> 00:21:12,721
[MORI] When the shaking stops,
start running!

318
00:21:15,306 --> 00:21:16,891
They're leaving?!

319
00:21:20,603 --> 00:21:23,565
Missing? What do you mean,
"he's missing"?

320
00:21:23,648 --> 00:21:27,318
I don't know what happened, but
a civilian flew it back herself.

321
00:21:27,402 --> 00:21:29,946
No, there's no one
else inside, sir.

322
00:21:32,115 --> 00:21:34,451
Kodai, where did you go?

323
00:21:34,534 --> 00:21:35,660
[KODAI grunting]

324
00:21:35,744 --> 00:21:38,371
[REDROWZ]
Aquarius. The origin point

325
00:21:38,455 --> 00:21:42,751
for so many humanoid races
throughout the galaxies.

326
00:21:42,834 --> 00:21:45,003
But why did the ancient
Aquarians insist

327
00:21:45,086 --> 00:21:48,131
on spreading their own
image across the stars?

328
00:21:48,214 --> 00:21:50,633
Was it to create heirs,
and ensure a legacy

329
00:21:50,717 --> 00:21:52,344
as they faced their
own destruction?

330
00:21:52,427 --> 00:21:57,807
If so, why did they choose this
demonstrably flawed design?

331
00:21:57,891 --> 00:21:59,309
Professor?

332
00:21:59,392 --> 00:22:01,770
[REDROWZ] They were on the brink
of their inevitable ruin,

333
00:22:01,853 --> 00:22:06,191
yet they decided to make
beings of the same form!

334
00:22:06,274 --> 00:22:08,151
Impulsive and
illogical creatures

335
00:22:08,234 --> 00:22:09,611
who cannot even reproduce

336
00:22:09,694 --> 00:22:12,280
without love between a male
and female of their kind.

337
00:22:12,364 --> 00:22:13,698
[gasps]

338
00:22:13,782 --> 00:22:16,826
[REDROWZ] They plunder, hate,
and kill one another.

339
00:22:16,910 --> 00:22:19,704
The chaos of their
so-called "civilizations"

340
00:22:19,788 --> 00:22:22,957
disrupts the harmony
of this universe.

341
00:22:24,459 --> 00:22:26,961
[REDROWZ]
I've been waiting.

342
00:22:27,045 --> 00:22:30,674
Who are you, really?

343
00:22:30,757 --> 00:22:33,885
[ZWORDER]
My name is Zworder.

344
00:22:33,968 --> 00:22:35,929
[KODAI gasping]

345
00:22:37,055 --> 00:22:40,016
I am he who knows love.

346
00:22:41,935 --> 00:22:46,106
Deeper than any other
in the cosmos...

347
00:22:46,189 --> 00:22:47,899
...true love.

348
00:22:47,982 --> 00:22:50,652
[KODAI gasping]

349
00:25:00,031 --> 00:25:01,282
[HIJIKATA]
Ascend at high speed!

350
00:25:01,366 --> 00:25:03,451
We're going to have
to draw their fire!

351
00:25:03,535 --> 00:25:05,745
[ZWORDER]
A demonstration. I will show you

352
00:25:05,829 --> 00:25:09,207
how your love can save,
and how it can destroy.

353
00:25:09,290 --> 00:25:09,833
[MORI]
Kodai.

354
00:25:09,916 --> 00:25:13,712
[KODAI]
Yuki!
