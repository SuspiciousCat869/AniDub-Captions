this be possible?

You can rely on Gamilas.
We're exhausting all efforts.

We'll defend the Earth.

33
00:05:01,458 --> 00:05:03,752
This has to be a
joint operation.

34
00:05:03,835 --> 00:05:05,920
You'll head straight to
the emperor's throne room

in the Ark of Destruction.

36
00:05:07,547 --> 00:05:09,382
It's not possible via warp.

37
00:05:09,466 --> 00:05:12,385
But with our advanced

This is something we
have yet to attempt.

41
00:05:28,193 --> 00:05:29,736
[FLAKEN] Even though
we're using four ships

42
00:05:29,819 --> 00:05:31,363
with specialized equipment,

43
00:05:31,446 --> 00:05:35,200
it's likely that the <i>Yamato</i>
will still have to go in alone.

44
00:05:35,283 --> 00:05:36,826
And there are many risks.

45
00:05:36,910 --> 00:05:40,163
There's no guarantee
of success here.

46
00:05:40,246 --> 00:05:44,334
[HIJIKATA] It's clear.
This, too, is the work of bonds.

47
00:05:44,417 --> 00:05:46,252
The Dimensional Submarine.

48
00:05:46,336 --> 00:05:48,129
Let it take the helm.

49
00:05:52,509 --> 00:05:53,760
All ships, together.

[YABU]
Diving now, sir!

52
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,788
[BERGER] We will hold
steady and fight the enemy

53
00:06:21,871 --> 00:06:24,499
until the <i>Yamato</i>
achieves its goal.

54
00:06:24,582 --> 00:06:26,459
Without fail!

55
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:19,471
[HEINI] We're almost
to the surfacing point.

56
00:07:19,554 --> 00:07:23,183
[FLAKEN] This is as far as
we can safely escort you.

57
00:07:23,266 --> 00:07:26,686
You're on your own now, <i>Yamato</i> .

58
00:07:41,534 --> 00:07:43,661
I pray we'll meet again.

59
00:07:58,677 --> 00:08:00,470
We're pretty much in
the belly of the beast.

60

Remain on the lookout
for enemies!

Heat source detected, no ID!

Karakrum-class,
but they're small.

63
00:08:07,852 --> 00:08:09,813
Sizes are all over
the place, in fact.

64
00:08:09,896 --> 00:08:10,980
What is this?

65
00:08:11,064 --> 00:08:13,149
It's just like
Katsuragi's intel told us.

66
00:08:13,233 --> 00:08:15,860
That thing. It's the
Gatlantean mothership.

67
00:08:15,944 --> 00:08:17,237
I think.

68
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:20,740
All systems, link us to
their automated navigation.

69
00:08:28,373 --> 00:08:30,875
[GOENITZ]
Hm? What is that light?

70
00:08:42,095 --> 00:08:45,557
It's a type of disruption
that utilizes cosmo waves.

71
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:47,183
We cannot shut it out.

72
00:08:47,267 --> 00:08:50,145
It's a superior code level.

73
00:08:50,228 --> 00:08:53,773
It can only be another
Silver Priestess.

74
00:08:55,191 --> 00:08:56,818

One who possesses the authority

Damage to our stern, sir!

our target is Golem.

It's kill or be killed.

105

But, then again,
we've known that all along.

It's strange.

I don't remember

[YUKI] So, if you're
out there, tell me.

00:11:47,614 --> 00:11:51,368
Is there some deeper
meaning to this suffering?

Something that justifies
all the bloodshed.

Does a reason like
that even exist?

00:13:45,398 --> 00:13:48,568
Combine them with
the <i>Yamato</i> 's systems

164
00:13:48,651 --> 00:13:50,570
and use them more efficiently.

165

Make them like an asteroid ring.

166
00:13:52,906 --> 00:13:55,200
Use that to defend
our air forces,

167
00:13:55,283 --> 00:13:58,828
then rush inside the gate
at the first chance.

168
00:13:58,912 --> 00:14:00,789
Can you do that?

Yes!

[HIJIKATA]

The <i>Yamato</i> 's
next captain is you.

[VALSEY gasps]

The magnetron waves.

179
00:15:23,288 --> 00:15:24,706
They seem to be
aligning perfectly

180
00:15:24,789 --> 00:15:26,666
with Toko's cosmo waves.

181
00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:29,669
This is Kodai.

182
00:15:29,753 --> 00:15:31,212
I'm joining up with
the air forces.

183
00:15:31,296 --> 00:15:33,340
From there, we'll go through
the gate as an advance force.

Hold on. What's that?

You go on ahead!

He's all yours.

[KATO]
I refuse to run anymore.

Right now I want to live so
bad it might just kill me.

I want to see Makoto's face.

I want to see Tsubasa healthy.

To carry him on my shoulders.

I want to do
everything for them.

All that I couldn't do before.

I will make it back alive.

Just like that, huh?

Pathetic.

Your daddy is a real-life hero.

how useless Earthlings are.

And you, the very same one who
opened the Ark of Destruction!

Why?!

Because I never should
have awakened it!

Is that so?
