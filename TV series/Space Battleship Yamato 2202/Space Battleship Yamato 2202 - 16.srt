No good! Not responding.

[HIJIKATA] All hands, prepare
for emergency landing.

Emergency landing
in four, three, two, one.

Klaus Keyman.

13
00:03:03,923 --> 00:03:07,135
I wonder... who is he,
ultimately?

14
00:03:07,218 --> 00:03:10,096
Was the Gamilan Ambassador
who invited Kodai to the moon

15
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:13,641
nothing more than a spy
from the very beginning?

16
00:03:13,725 --> 00:03:15,101
Who knows?

17
00:03:15,185 --> 00:03:17,354
It seemed as though Desler's
appearance was a surprise

18
00:03:17,437 --> 00:03:20,148
to Keyman, as well. But, still.

19
00:03:20,231 --> 00:03:22,650
Why was he aboard the <i>Yamato</i> ?

20
00:03:26,279 --> 00:03:28,156
[KEYMAN]
I am just like you.

21
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:29,574
I can't allow the earthlings

22

to take control of
Terezart's power.

23
00:03:32,202 --> 00:03:34,788
That's why I chose to accompany
them, to neutralize

24
00:03:34,871 --> 00:03:37,665
the <i>Yamato</i> at the
appropriate moment.

25
00:03:37,749 --> 00:03:38,750
[DESLER]
Thereby bringing

26
00:03:38,833 --> 00:03:41,961
the power of Terezart
back to Gamilas.

For those who resist
democratization,

[DESLER]
It's been a while. Hello, Mil.

32
00:03:59,938 --> 00:04:03,483
There seemed to be quite a bit
of commotion outside earlier.

33
00:04:03,566 --> 00:04:04,984
[DESLER]
Oh, yes.

34
00:04:05,068 --> 00:04:07,112
Some outlaws attempted to
steal the emperor's treasure,

35
00:04:07,195 --> 00:04:09,114
but it was nothing to
be too worried about.

36
00:04:09,197 --> 00:04:11,574
I simply punished them
and took it back.

[gasps]

38
00:04:13,118 --> 00:04:14,828
Which means Terezart
is now under

the absolute control
of our fleet.

The door is open.

You may see for yourself,
if you'd like.

[DESLER]
Seeing is your job, after all.

44

Now that it's ours,

45
00:04:28,508 --> 00:04:30,260
I wish to enter
into negotiations

46
00:04:30,343 --> 00:04:32,637
with Emperor Zworder.

47
00:04:32,721 --> 00:04:36,099
I will humbly offer
Terezart to the Emperor.

48
00:04:36,182 --> 00:04:38,059
And in exchange...

49
00:04:46,109 --> 00:04:48,570
[KEYMAN] Do you think they'll
agree to negotiate with you?

50
00:04:48,653 --> 00:04:51,114
Emperor Zworder does not
strike me as the sort of man

51
00:04:51,197 --> 00:04:53,575
to be preoccupied
with appearances.

52
00:04:53,658 --> 00:04:56,369
When he considers the
possibility of losing Teresa

53
00:04:56,453 --> 00:04:58,913
along with her planet,
if they fight us,

54
00:04:58,997 --> 00:05:01,583
I'm sure he'll hear our demands.

55
00:05:01,666 --> 00:05:05,045
The discovery of a planet
where we Gamilans can live,

56
00:05:05,128 --> 00:05:07,922
or the creation of one.

57
00:05:08,006 --> 00:05:11,092
Gatlantis may be able
to achieve that.

Sir?

60
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,350
[DESLER] What kind of ship
would you say it was?

61
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:23,063
An unusual vessel.

62
00:05:23,146 --> 00:05:25,690
And its crew was a little
strange, as well.

63
00:05:25,774 --> 00:05:27,442
They weren't like soldiers.

64
00:05:27,525 --> 00:05:30,445
Seemed more like pilgrims,
if you ask me.

is blessed with great fortune.

Does Teresa really exist?

70

[KARZET]
Yes. The Gatlantean forces

71
00:05:52,634 --> 00:05:54,844
occupying the planet
were all but eliminated.

72

Tides have turned.

00:05:56,137 --> 00:05:59,057
Terezart is now
under our control.

74
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:00,975
Our fleet has control?

75
00:06:01,059 --> 00:06:03,687
What's their attachment?

[GENERAL 16B]
What? Does this mean he's alive?

79
00:06:14,114 --> 00:06:16,449
[KEYMAN] The head of
the Deslerists is unknown.

80

It's been a mystery for years.

he might be, either.

I'm sure he'll
show himself soon.

At this stage, whoever
it is has no other choice

84
00:06:27,168 --> 00:06:29,504
but to contact me directly.

see you alive again.

Hello, Gimleh.

92
00:06:48,106 --> 00:06:50,400
[GIMLEH] As the dictator went
mad and tried to destroy

93
00:06:50,483 --> 00:06:52,527
the <i>Yamato,</i>
the Capital, Baleras,

94
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:56,114
became caught in the crossfire.
This is the defamatory tale

95
00:06:56,197 --> 00:06:59,242
the Democrats are espousing,
just so you're aware.

96
00:06:59,325 --> 00:07:01,828
However, I know the real story.

97
00:07:01,911 --> 00:07:05,790
You only took that route to save
both Iscandar and Gamilas.

98
00:07:05,874 --> 00:07:08,752
It was an act of necessity.

99
00:07:08,835 --> 00:07:10,211
Baleras Tower.

100
00:07:10,295 --> 00:07:13,965
It was a blade pointed
directly at Iscandar.

101
00:07:14,049 --> 00:07:16,092
Those who stole
the Cosmo Reverse,

102
00:07:16,176 --> 00:07:19,220
and plotted against you,
even if only to save Gamilas

103
00:07:19,304 --> 00:07:22,265
from the path of ruin,
still built that massive weapon

104
00:07:22,349 --> 00:07:25,310
without your
permission to do so.

105
00:07:25,393 --> 00:07:27,979
Thus, the military betrayed you.

106
00:07:28,063 --> 00:07:30,357
You, who had discovered
their intentions,

107
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:32,359
made use of
the <i>Yamato</i> 's attack,

108
00:07:32,442 --> 00:07:35,028
and cut the ship that served
as its source of energy

109
00:07:35,111 --> 00:07:36,821
free from the tower.

110
00:07:38,114 --> 00:07:39,949
[GIMLEH] Then, in order
to effectively wipe out

111
00:07:40,033 --> 00:07:43,495
the traitors, you destroyed
the second Baleras.

112
00:07:44,662 --> 00:07:47,332
[GIMLEH] And I know that you
did it all to save Gamilas

113
00:07:47,415 --> 00:07:50,085
and bring peace to Iscandar.

114
00:07:50,168 --> 00:07:52,504
If we are to ensure
Gamilas's future,

115
00:07:52,587 --> 00:07:56,383
then a powerful dictatorial
regime is our only option.

116
00:07:56,466 --> 00:07:57,801
When you were presumed dead,

117
00:07:57,884 --> 00:07:59,969
I thought that Master Ranhalt
was the obvious choice

118
00:08:00,053 --> 00:08:02,138
to take your place
as dictator, but then,

119
00:08:02,222 --> 00:08:05,183
much to my surprise, I learned
that you were alive and well.

120
00:08:05,266 --> 00:08:06,142
So, Ranhalt.

121
00:08:06,226 --> 00:08:07,310
Yes?

122
00:08:07,394 --> 00:08:09,562
Tell me. Do I have
your blessing to rule?

123
00:08:09,646 --> 00:08:11,439
Uh. Yes, of course.

124
00:08:11,523 --> 00:08:14,484
Very well, we shall inform
the people at once

That's right.

As far as we can tell,
it's not a mechanical failure.

I have no idea what
the underlying cause is.

132

Although I think it's probably
safe to assume it can only

133
00:08:53,982 --> 00:08:56,401
be an issue with the Wave
Motion Engine itself.

If you really are a goddess
who can see to the end of time,

00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:07,347
I beg you to come to my aid!

[TERESA] While aboard

they were all correct.

160
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:04,029
Might be embarrassing.

161
00:11:04,112 --> 00:11:06,740
But that title is one that
you must have been seeking

162
00:11:06,823 --> 00:11:08,867
for quite some time.

163
00:11:11,995 --> 00:11:14,873
Heh. If Teresa were
the sort of being

164
00:11:14,956 --> 00:11:16,791
one could take from this place,

165
00:11:16,875 --> 00:11:20,670
I might think you were trying
to betray me by coming here.

166
00:11:20,754 --> 00:11:23,256
And you, then?
What brings you to her?

167
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:26,009
[DESLER]
Likely the same thing as you.

168
00:11:26,092 --> 00:11:29,679
Everyone has something they
use for emotional support.

169
00:11:29,763 --> 00:11:31,848
Especially if they've
lived most of their life

170
00:11:31,931 --> 00:11:35,435
relying solely on
their own power.

171
00:11:35,518 --> 00:11:39,022
And yet this support
upon which I relied...

172
00:11:41,649 --> 00:11:44,527
She swooped in and
took a planet from us.

173
00:11:44,611 --> 00:11:47,280
One we were attempting to
remake from the ground up

174
00:11:47,364 --> 00:11:49,532
to create a new home
for our people.

175
00:11:49,616 --> 00:11:52,994
We planned to migrate
there and begin a new life.

176
00:11:53,078 --> 00:11:55,663
[KEYMAN]
You wanted to save Iscandar.

177
00:11:55,747 --> 00:11:57,290
And so...

178
00:11:57,374 --> 00:12:00,460
[DESLER] The Cosmo Reverse
is not all powerful.

179
00:12:00,543 --> 00:12:02,921
And our planet is not Earth.

180
00:12:03,004 --> 00:12:05,382
I am not certain whether
even the Cosmo Reverse

181
00:12:05,465 --> 00:12:08,259
can save Gamilas.

182
00:12:08,343 --> 00:12:10,178
And that is why

183
00:12:10,261 --> 00:12:13,598
I sought a new frontier in
the far reaches of space.

184
00:12:13,682 --> 00:12:16,726
However, the end result, heh,

185
00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:19,938
I don't have to remind you
what that was.

186
00:12:20,021 --> 00:12:21,940
At that time

187
00:12:22,023 --> 00:12:24,567
what was I trying to destroy?

188
00:12:27,237 --> 00:12:29,197
Supreme Leader Desler.

189
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:30,740
Oh, well.

190
00:12:30,824 --> 00:12:33,576
Whatever my reasons, the fact
remains that I tried to get

191
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:36,996
a large portion of our
population caught up in it.

192
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,415
And for that sin,

193
00:12:38,498 --> 00:12:43,086
I may never truly atone,
no matter how I try.

194
00:12:43,169 --> 00:12:46,423
In the future, if the people
of Gamilas decide to trust

195
00:12:46,506 --> 00:12:49,175
another Desler with the
honor of ruling over them,

196
00:12:49,259 --> 00:12:50,844
it can only be you.

197
00:12:50,927 --> 00:12:53,722
[gasps] Do you mean...?

198
00:12:56,725 --> 00:12:58,309
Forgive me.

199
00:13:03,857 --> 00:13:07,277
[TERESA] Deep within your heart,
you will always find love

200
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,738
for someone other than yourself.

201
00:13:09,821 --> 00:13:11,698
You continue to treasure them,

202
00:13:11,781 --> 00:13:14,409
more than you value
your own life.

203
00:13:14,492 --> 00:13:16,453
And as long as you
have that feeling,

204
00:13:16,536 --> 00:13:18,538
you are qualified to rule.

205
00:13:18,621 --> 00:13:21,332
You have the strength
to lead your people,

206
00:13:21,416 --> 00:13:24,878
and it stems from your selfless
love for another being.

207
00:13:24,961 --> 00:13:29,174
[chuckles] And you love to
answer questions no one asked.

208
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:36,639
[TERESA]
It's complete.

209
00:13:36,723 --> 00:13:40,060
It appears all the
bonds are in place.

210
00:13:40,143 --> 00:13:41,686
[gasps]

211
00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:43,563
Teresa?

212
00:13:46,566 --> 00:13:48,777
[BURRELL]
Secretary Hyss. Just now

213
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:52,030
we received communication
from Lieutenant Keyman.

214
00:13:52,113 --> 00:13:53,740
[HYSS]
And did he learn anything?

215
00:13:53,823 --> 00:13:56,076
He did, about the plot
to restore Desler.

216
00:13:56,159 --> 00:13:59,704
The man leading that faction
is former Director-General

217
00:13:59,788 --> 00:14:02,499
of the Imperial Guard,
Heydom Gimleh.

218
00:14:02,582 --> 00:14:05,877
It's Gimleh?
I didn't know he was alive!

219
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:08,755
On the honor of the Security
and Intelligence Bureau,

220
00:14:08,838 --> 00:14:11,424
I promise I will arrest him!

221
00:14:17,013 --> 00:14:19,182
[KEYMAN]
If I keep my emotions...

222
00:14:24,938 --> 00:14:26,731
Uh? Uh!

223
00:14:32,779 --> 00:14:35,782
[SAITO] Hey! Gammy! What do
you think you're doing here?

224
00:14:35,865 --> 00:14:37,659
[KODAI]
Stop it, Saito.

225
00:14:39,703 --> 00:14:40,954
[grunts]

226
00:14:41,121 --> 00:14:42,539
How can I--

227
00:14:42,622 --> 00:14:44,916
How can we believe what you say?

228
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,252
[KEYMAN]
You can't. Words from the mouth

229
00:14:47,335 --> 00:14:50,296
of an undercover operative
shouldn't be trusted.

230
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:51,673
Undercover?

231
00:14:51,756 --> 00:14:53,466
Bureau of Security
and Intelligence.

232
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:55,719
Internal Investigations Unit.

233
00:14:58,013 --> 00:15:01,474
That's who I work for.
We're going back to the <i>Yamato.</i>

234
00:15:01,558 --> 00:15:05,937
If you're going to
kill me, do it later.

235
00:15:06,021 --> 00:15:07,522
[DESLER]
Rebellion?

236
00:15:07,605 --> 00:15:10,066
[TARAN] It seems Master Ranhalt,
who was returning ahead of us,

237
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:12,777
released the Earthlings
without our knowledge.

238
00:15:14,821 --> 00:15:16,865
[DESLER]
Let him do as he pleases.

239
00:15:16,948 --> 00:15:18,700
The <i>Yamato,</i> too.

240
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:22,328
I can't quite figure out why,

241
00:15:22,412 --> 00:15:25,498
but it just ignited out
of nowhere. It's odd.

242
00:15:25,582 --> 00:15:28,418
It's nothing to celebrate until
we know a little bit more.

243
00:15:28,501 --> 00:15:30,962
We may have to give
the order to abandon ship.

244
00:15:31,046 --> 00:15:32,881
We can't. We'll fly as we are.

245
00:15:32,964 --> 00:15:35,216
Shima! Prepare to
initiate launch!

246
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:36,468
Uh. Roger.

247
00:15:36,551 --> 00:15:38,178
Hey, Chief. That all right?

248
00:15:38,261 --> 00:15:39,888
[TOKUGAWA]
Do what you want!

249
00:15:40,889 --> 00:15:43,433
[KEYMAN] Ambassador Burrell
came up through Intelligence,

250
00:15:43,516 --> 00:15:45,518
and he believes
democratization is needed

251
00:15:45,602 --> 00:15:47,312
to build a future for Gamilas.

252
00:15:47,395 --> 00:15:50,482
I was working under his orders
to expose the mastermind

253
00:15:50,565 --> 00:15:52,984
who's trying to restore
Desler to power.

254
00:15:53,068 --> 00:15:55,487
But you're part of his family.

255
00:15:55,570 --> 00:15:57,197
Yes, all the more reason.

256
00:15:57,280 --> 00:16:00,367
I wish to leave Gamilas
a true democracy.

257
00:16:00,450 --> 00:16:03,495
You see, it's the least I
can do to atone for the sin

258
00:16:03,578 --> 00:16:05,997
of being born the nephew
of a tyrant.

259
00:16:06,081 --> 00:16:08,833
[KODAI] So, then, the reason
you boarded the <i>Yamato,</i>

260
00:16:08,917 --> 00:16:10,835
and helped us make
it to Terezart...

261
00:16:10,919 --> 00:16:13,630
[KEYMAN] I did it all as a
way to win Desler's trust,

262
00:16:13,713 --> 00:16:16,800
and get closer to
the architect of the plot.

263
00:16:16,883 --> 00:16:18,968
And my plan was a success.

264
00:16:19,052 --> 00:16:22,931
But then, Desler himself
showed up unexpectedly.

265
00:16:23,014 --> 00:16:24,683
Why don't you just go with him?

266
00:16:24,766 --> 00:16:26,643
[beeping, door clicks]

267
00:16:27,143 --> 00:16:28,603
[KODAI]
If this rumor about Gamilas

268
00:16:28,687 --> 00:16:31,564
being close to the end
of its life is true...

269
00:16:31,648 --> 00:16:35,568
[KEYMAN] Oh, yes.
That was an option, too.

270
00:16:35,652 --> 00:16:40,490
However, the goddess
told me something.

271
00:16:40,573 --> 00:16:41,991
[gasps]

272
00:16:42,075 --> 00:16:45,078
[KEYMAN] Don't think, take
action from your true feelings.

273
00:16:45,161 --> 00:16:48,331
[AIHARA] Incoming call from
XO Sanada! Everyone is safe!

274
00:16:48,415 --> 00:16:49,749
[HIJIKATA grunts]

275
00:16:57,841 --> 00:16:59,926
Get in there already!

276
00:17:02,012 --> 00:17:03,972
[gasps]

277
00:17:04,055 --> 00:17:05,348
[KODAI]
Keyman!

278
00:17:21,322 --> 00:17:22,824
[KEYMAN grunts]

279
00:17:23,491 --> 00:17:25,285
<i>Yamato,</i> take off!

280
00:17:30,498 --> 00:17:32,208
[SHIMA]
Deploying main wings!

281
00:17:38,173 --> 00:17:41,176
[MIL] It seems you, too, chose
to do something unexpected.

282
00:17:41,259 --> 00:17:42,552
[KEYMAN gasping]

283
00:17:42,635 --> 00:17:44,554
That impulsiveness
and emotionality

284
00:17:44,637 --> 00:17:46,306
will destroy the universe!

285
00:17:46,389 --> 00:17:52,520
And yet... my emotions also
give me the power to do this.

286
00:17:56,232 --> 00:17:57,317
Damn you!

287
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:58,777
[groaning]

288
00:18:01,946 --> 00:18:04,491
Are you sure you're
okay with all this?

289
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:16,127
[KODAI] This is Kodai.
We've lost track of Keyman.

290
00:18:16,211 --> 00:18:18,338
Are you able to trace
him on your end?

291
00:18:18,421 --> 00:18:19,714
[AIHARA] He withdrew
from the enemy ship

292
00:18:19,798 --> 00:18:22,759
and then took a sudden dive.
We've lost his signal.

293
00:18:22,842 --> 00:18:23,843
What'd you say?

294
00:18:23,927 --> 00:18:25,345
[AIHARA]
Yamamoto is currently in route

295
00:18:25,428 --> 00:18:27,013
to investigate his status.

296
00:18:30,141 --> 00:18:31,935
[KEYMAN]
Is this it, then?

297
00:18:42,612 --> 00:18:44,406
[KEYMAN gasping]

298
00:18:47,659 --> 00:18:50,078
[KEYMAN]
I was alone for so long.

299
00:18:54,165 --> 00:18:58,378
[KEYMAN] And, alone,
I was able to do anything.

300
00:18:58,461 --> 00:19:01,089
But now, that's changed.

301
00:19:04,050 --> 00:19:07,387
[gasping]

302
00:19:10,015 --> 00:19:14,144
[KEYMAN]
Mother.

303
00:19:14,227 --> 00:19:17,022
One more time.

304
00:19:17,105 --> 00:19:20,275
[YAMAMOTO] I'll save him,
no matter what!

305
00:19:20,358 --> 00:19:23,153
Huh?! There he is!

306
00:19:39,127 --> 00:19:41,504
[YAMAMOTO] This is Yamamoto.
I've got Lieutenant Keyman.

307
00:19:41,588 --> 00:19:43,340
Have a medical team ready.

308
00:19:47,552 --> 00:19:49,846
What the--?
What the hell's going on?

309
00:19:51,639 --> 00:19:52,932
Teresa.

310
00:19:53,016 --> 00:19:54,934
Yuki? What is it?

311
00:19:55,018 --> 00:19:58,813
Teresa said, "Don't forget
what I told you."

312
00:20:02,442 --> 00:20:04,486
[TERESA]
I bid you farewell.

313
00:20:04,569 --> 00:20:08,573
All of you. The time has
come for me to return

314
00:20:08,656 --> 00:20:12,160
to where I belong, but
I will continue to pray.

315
00:20:12,243 --> 00:20:15,997
However, I do not pray
solely for one planet,

316
00:20:16,081 --> 00:20:19,125
nor for any particular
people, either.

317
00:20:19,209 --> 00:20:21,169
Of course. I should
have known we couldn't

318
00:20:21,252 --> 00:20:23,546
keep her in our
clutches for long.

319
00:20:27,342 --> 00:20:30,970
[TERESA]
Planet to planet. Time to time.

320
00:20:31,054 --> 00:20:35,725
And also, person to person.

321
00:20:35,809 --> 00:20:40,980
The field of life is held
together by bonds of love.

322
00:20:54,202 --> 00:20:57,288
[TERESA] The power that
supports the universe.

323
00:21:00,291 --> 00:21:04,045
[MIL]
What is this? It can't be.

324
00:21:07,757 --> 00:21:12,095
[gasps] Is this Teresa's...?

325
00:21:13,388 --> 00:21:17,142
[TERESA] I entrust my wishes
to the ship of Great Harmony.

326
00:21:17,225 --> 00:21:21,146
And, as I said,
I will continue to pray.

327
00:21:51,009 --> 00:21:54,012
[KODAI]
Bonds.

328
00:21:54,095 --> 00:21:56,348
The love of the universe.

329
00:22:05,231 --> 00:22:07,359
I suppose this will do.

330
00:22:19,579 --> 00:22:22,916
[HIJIKATA] We were entrusted
with a prayer, and that means

331
00:22:22,999 --> 00:22:26,044
we must do everything
we can to stop Gatlantis.

332
00:22:26,127 --> 00:22:27,962
For all the life in
this universe,

333
00:22:28,046 --> 00:22:30,924
I cannot exaggerate
what's at stake.

334
00:22:32,759 --> 00:22:35,595
So, reverse course, and
full speed, on both sides!

335
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:38,848
<i>Yamato,</i> we now set
our course for Earth!

336
00:25:36,818 --> 00:25:38,570
[MIL]
Defeat the <i>Yamato.</i>

337
00:25:38,653 --> 00:25:40,780
[GIMLEH] If this continues,
Gamilas will be ruined!

338
00:25:40,864 --> 00:25:42,532
[DESLER]
Who are you? Tell me.

339
00:25:42,615 --> 00:25:44,993
[KEYMAN] All the same.
I am nothing but a traitor.

340
00:25:45,076 --> 00:25:46,244
[SHIMA]
What is their ultimate goal?

341
00:25:46,327 --> 00:25:48,121
[KODAI]
The elimination of all life,

342
00:25:48,204 --> 00:25:50,165
and that includes themselves.
