Chief Intel Archivist Gairen,

2
00:02:28,763 --> 00:02:32,559
we need you to bring up the
records regarding the <i>Yamato.</i>

3
00:02:32,642 --> 00:02:34,436
[GAIREN]
Yes, ma'am.

4
00:02:40,567 --> 00:02:41,943
[GAIREN]
This is what we observed

5
00:02:42,027 --> 00:02:46,448
near Balun 31.72 hebrons ago.

6
00:03:02,589 --> 00:03:04,257
What a powerful weapon.

7
00:03:04,341 --> 00:03:07,927
That ship's dangerous.
Contact Mazer's fleet.

8
00:03:08,011 --> 00:03:10,138
They were ordered to
invade the Zol System.

9
00:03:10,221 --> 00:03:11,556
[ZWORDER]
No need.

10
00:03:11,639 --> 00:03:12,265
Huh...?

11
00:03:12,349 --> 00:03:14,476
They will not use it.

12
00:03:14,559 --> 00:03:19,564
The <i>Yamato</i> may hold the power,
but they lack the will.

13
00:03:21,358 --> 00:03:27,364
[laughs]

14
00:03:45,882 --> 00:03:49,594
This is terrible! Look at that!

15
00:03:49,678 --> 00:03:53,014
[YAMAMOTO] <i>Yamato.</i> This is
Cosmo Tiger pilot Yamamoto.

16
00:03:53,098 --> 00:03:55,517
Do you copy?

17
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:59,104
Please respond. Come on...

[YAMATO CREW chattering]

22
00:04:12,033 --> 00:04:13,702
[TOKUGAWA]
There's no time to spare!

23
00:04:13,785 --> 00:04:15,745
Do whatever it takes
to keep us stable,

24
00:04:15,829 --> 00:04:17,706
and start up the sub-engine!

25
00:04:17,789 --> 00:04:21,501
Send all available energy to
main engine. Every bit counts!

26
00:04:21,584 --> 00:04:24,879
Hurry sir! There's not much more
we can do for the shields.

27
00:04:24,963 --> 00:04:27,090
If they fail we'll
be crushed flat.

28
00:04:27,173 --> 00:04:29,300
Analyzer, report.

[ANALYZER]
Determining rock configuration

necessary to disperse weight

00:04:35,724 --> 00:04:37,600
Calculation complete.

32
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:41,604
Aim magnetron probes, and fire!

33
00:04:42,981 --> 00:04:44,315
Fire!

[TOKUGAWA]
Probes holding steady.

38
00:05:09,924 --> 00:05:11,343
It actually worked!

39
00:05:11,426 --> 00:05:13,345
That's one more close call.

40
00:05:13,428 --> 00:05:14,929
[sighs]

41
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:33,698
[COSMODART] Admiral Mazer, we're
detecting faint energy readings

42
00:05:33,782 --> 00:05:35,283
just below the surface.

43
00:05:35,367 --> 00:05:39,788
That Earthling ship, the
<i>Yamato,</i> may still be intact.

44
00:05:39,871 --> 00:05:43,583
No matter. The Emperor's
decision has come down.

45
00:05:43,667 --> 00:05:45,335
Thankfully we've been
granted permission

46
00:05:45,418 --> 00:05:48,338
to use the Legionnaire
Cannon just as we hoped.

47
00:05:48,421 --> 00:05:50,006
Make the preparations.

48
00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:51,299
Sir.

49
00:05:52,801 --> 00:05:55,178
Look at this false star
lighting up their system's

50
00:05:55,261 --> 00:05:58,932
most distant planet,
but not for long.

51
00:06:10,276 --> 00:06:12,028
There're so many of them.

52
00:06:12,112 --> 00:06:14,489
[KEYMAN] Did you manage
to contact the <i>Yamato</i> ?

53
00:06:14,572 --> 00:06:18,243
They're safe down there. They'll
launch once they finish repairs.

54
00:06:18,326 --> 00:06:22,038
[KEYMAN] You should send them
that recon report, as well.

55
00:06:22,122 --> 00:06:25,542
Not that knowing is going
to make any difference now.

56
00:06:27,419 --> 00:06:28,545
Problem?

57
00:06:28,628 --> 00:06:29,963
Not really.

58
00:06:32,382 --> 00:06:36,928
Always so calm, aren't ya?
Must be your cold blood.

59
00:06:37,012 --> 00:06:39,931
It seems my translator
is malfunctioning.

60
00:06:40,015 --> 00:06:42,267
If that's the case,
you'd better take it off.

61
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:44,144
I'd hate for you
to hear us talking,

62
00:06:44,227 --> 00:06:48,189
but then have no freaking idea
what we're actually feeling.

00:06:52,402 --> 00:06:53,778

[KATO]
Pass out emergency rations.

00:06:55,864 --> 00:06:58,074
Get some from my plane

Well, they get hungry
same as us, don't they?

69
00:07:02,287 --> 00:07:05,123
And put something
in your belly, too.

70
00:07:05,206 --> 00:07:07,250
Uh, yes, sir.

71
00:07:21,222 --> 00:07:24,809
Sorry for Commander
Kato--it isn't you.

72
00:07:26,269 --> 00:07:29,314
[YAMAMOTO]
His son is sick, and his wife...

73
00:07:29,397 --> 00:07:31,358
Things haven't been
easy for him.

74
00:07:31,441 --> 00:07:33,860
That's not it. He's angry

75
00:07:33,943 --> 00:07:37,822
because he's certain your crew
will overcome this and I'm not.

76
00:07:37,906 --> 00:07:40,450
That's why he's picking
a fight with me.

77
00:07:41,951 --> 00:07:46,373
Face it. The <i>Yamato</i> is
not the same as before.

78
00:07:46,456 --> 00:07:48,875
That fact should be
obvious to all of you.

79
00:07:48,958 --> 00:07:52,253
And yet, it seems
no one wants to say it.

80
00:07:52,337 --> 00:07:53,713
You've put all
the responsibility

81
00:07:53,797 --> 00:07:58,468
on your acting captain,
and this is the end result.

82
00:08:01,930 --> 00:08:03,390
This rescue...

83
00:08:03,473 --> 00:08:06,935
You were opposed to it
from the start, Lieutenant.

84
00:08:07,018 --> 00:08:08,478
That's right.

85
00:08:08,561 --> 00:08:12,565
But I'll admit, you've saved
many lives, at least up to now.

86
00:08:12,649 --> 00:08:14,067
If we do manage to escape,

87
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:18,697
then I suppose Kodai will
have made the right decision.

88
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:22,992
He may be stubborn,
but he's not foolish.

89
00:08:25,161 --> 00:08:26,996
How can there be this many?

90
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:29,958
And according to Keyman there
was still a constant stream

91
00:08:30,041 --> 00:08:32,877
of ships warping out after
he finished recording this.

[SHIMA]
Who's asking?

00:08:44,597 --> 00:08:47,267
I'm Commander of the Space
Cavalry Seventh Regiment,

my deepest gratitude.

You saved the lives of
over 200 colonists.

Thank you. You've risked a lot.

104
00:08:58,611 --> 00:09:02,032
That said, there's a question
I can't help but ask.

105
00:09:02,115 --> 00:09:04,701
What the hell are
you waiting for?!

106
00:09:04,784 --> 00:09:09,039
Your ship has the Wave
Motion Gun! Why not use it?

107
00:09:10,582 --> 00:09:13,001
I don't have to answer
to you, Commander.

108
00:09:13,084 --> 00:09:14,711
[SAITO]
Don't you have a responsibility

109
00:09:14,794 --> 00:09:16,338
to the people you've
taken aboard?

110

Hey! That's enough!

111
00:09:17,881 --> 00:09:20,425
All of these people believe
you've saved their lives.

112
00:09:20,508 --> 00:09:23,136
They believe they can
go to Earth now.

113
00:09:23,219 --> 00:09:27,182
They believe in the <i>Yamato</i>
that achieved the impossible!

114
00:09:27,265 --> 00:09:28,933
If you don't use that Gun,

[KODAI gasping]
Resolve...?

Kodai.

181
00:13:50,362 --> 00:13:54,366
Kodai, we should use the Gun.

182
00:13:57,202 --> 00:13:59,537
It's the only option we have.

183
00:13:59,621 --> 00:14:02,290
If that formation is
the weapon we think it is,

184
00:14:02,374 --> 00:14:04,793
the damage to planet Earth
would be immeasurable.

185
00:14:04,876 --> 00:14:07,128
[KODAI]
A promise.

186
00:14:07,212 --> 00:14:08,797
He made a promise.

187
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,257
Captain Okita gave
his word to Starsha

188
00:14:11,341 --> 00:14:13,677
that we wouldn't use
the Wave Motion Gun again.

189
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:16,054
That's how the Earth was saved.

Sanada. I'm just... I'm lost.

I've tried to do these things

00:14:23,353 --> 00:14:25,605
that shouldn't even
be in question.

193
00:14:25,689 --> 00:14:30,276
Keeping our promises.
Saving people who ask for help.

194
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:33,238
Those things should
be givens, right?!

[KODAI] If our kind can't do
those fundamental things,

00:14:39,577 --> 00:14:43,415
then I'm embarrassed
to call Earth my home.

I wanna prove we're
not all that weak.

I want to show Earthlings
can be better.

That's the <i>Yamato</i> 's role.

But to live...

202
00:14:54,676 --> 00:14:57,095
...we'll have to break
that promise ourselves,

203
00:14:57,178 --> 00:14:59,472

00:15:43,933 --> 00:15:45,727
from Lieutenant Keyman.

209
00:15:45,810 --> 00:15:47,812
[KEYMAN]
It's dawn up here, Kodai.

210
00:15:47,896 --> 00:15:51,775
You can't see it, since
you're buried underground.

211
00:15:51,858 --> 00:15:55,487
But the artificial sun we
Gamilans left is quite a marvel.

212
00:15:55,570 --> 00:15:57,572
I just thought you should know.

213
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:16,216
Understood. Thank you.

I wish you luck.

Uh.

00:16:31,564 --> 00:16:32,899
[TOKUGAWA]
Mm.

222
00:16:33,191 --> 00:16:35,610
Kodai. To do this
we'll need to time it

223
00:16:35,694 --> 00:16:37,987
to the instant that sun
enters their formation.

Hang in there, Old Man.

you'll be in good hands.

00:18:16,211 --> 00:18:18,963
Are you just going to watch
while the enemy destroys us?

00:18:19,047 --> 00:18:19,881
Come on!

What's happening to the fleet?

256
00:20:11,659 --> 00:20:13,578
[COSMODART]
Some sort of wave interference!

00:20:13,661 --> 00:20:16,414
The power system on every
ship is malfunctioning!

[MAZER growls]

259
00:20:31,846 --> 00:20:36,142
So it's the same as the depth
charges we used before. Correct?

260
00:20:36,226 --> 00:20:37,644
That's right.

261
00:20:37,727 --> 00:20:40,897
It shot directly into the
artificial sun's core reactor.

262
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:43,900
The wave motion resonance
creates interference.

They won't be able
to move for some time.

is a true marvel.

I said to him.

This is Susumu Kodai,

Acting Captain of the
Space Battleship <i>Yamato.</i>

269
00:21:00,625 --> 00:21:01,793
If we attack now,

270
00:21:01,876 --> 00:21:05,422
we can eliminate every
vessel in your fleet.

271
00:21:05,505 --> 00:21:08,758
We can, but we don't
want to keep fighting.

272
00:21:08,842 --> 00:21:12,220
We want you to peacefully
withdraw from this system.

273
00:21:12,303 --> 00:21:16,266
If you comply, we will not
pursue and we will not attack.

274
00:21:16,349 --> 00:21:19,602
We come from different worlds,
but as fellow sentient beings,

275
00:21:19,686 --> 00:21:21,938
I ask that you think
this through.

276
00:21:22,022 --> 00:21:25,984
Forgiveness? Really?
After what they just did?

277
00:21:26,067 --> 00:21:28,528
It's possible that's
the right move.

278
00:21:28,611 --> 00:21:31,614
However, for that to be
true the other side

279
00:21:31,698 --> 00:21:33,575
would have to think like we do.

00:21:35,076 --> 00:21:38,038
[HIJIKATA] Our new enemies are
not like the Gamilans.

282
00:21:38,121 --> 00:21:42,083
These spared dogs may
come back to bite.

[MAZER] Run away.
He actually told us to run away.

Instead of killing us
or taking us prisoner.

285
00:21:52,677 --> 00:21:56,723
How can this be?
Why would they let us go?

286
00:21:56,806 --> 00:21:59,893
[COSMODART] I don't understand.
It makes no sense!

What in the world
are they doing?

Heh.

thing and saved the Earth

00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:22,123
without taking a single life.
I'd call that admirable.

[KODAI exhales]
I can twist it however I want,

293
00:22:25,794 --> 00:22:28,713
but it won't change the fact
I used the Wave Motion Gun.

[SANADA]
Kodai.

295

[KODAI]
I know.

296
00:22:32,926 --> 00:22:35,679
I won't say it in in
front of the others.

297
00:22:38,473 --> 00:22:43,645
Maybe I'm fooling myself, but we
all have to start somewhere.

00:24:59,906 --> 00:25:01,449
[HIJIKATA]
I have this feeling--

299
00:25:01,533 --> 00:25:03,368
like Okita is still
onboard this ship.

300

[KODAI]
All right. Who are you?

It's practically a graveyard.

You're telling me a civilian

What's going on here, Keyman?

305
